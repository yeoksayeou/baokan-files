　　The Heroine in the Cotton Field
    Luo Guizhen Picks 1,511 Jin of Cotton in One Day
    In the cotton fields of the Manas River Basin in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang, silver cotton blossoms are blooming everywhere, shining with white light. Thousands of workers are racing against time day and night to harvest cotton.
    On the day I arrived at the Shihezi Reclamation Area, the Reclamation Area Party Committee had just held an emergency telephone conference calling on all workers to devote themselves to the urgent harvesting of frost-front cotton. Cadres from all government offices went to the fields to participate in the cotton-picking battle. Red flags fluttered in the cotton fields, and songs and laughter echoed. Male and female workers were divided into groups of three or four, and competitions were held between classes and groups. They wore white flower bags on their chests and carefully and quickly picked cotton with both hands at the same time. In this competition, countless cotton-picking experts emerged, among whom Luo Guizhen was the most outstanding. Under normal circumstances, each person picks about 200 jin of cotton per day, but Luo Guizhen created a new record of 1,511 jin.
    When I and Party Branch Secretary Yu Jinquan arrived at the cotton field, Luo Guizhen was leading a group to contract and attack a cotton field. The two slender hands of this short-haired girl quickly shuttled between the dense cotton plants like swimming fish in the river. As soon as the right hand caught a flower, the left hand had already reached for the second flower. Her eyes never left her two hands, and she constantly bit off the broken leaves falling on the cotton wool with her mouth. Secretary Yu said to me: "This is the fast cotton-picking method they created. If you use your hands to pick off the leaves on the cotton, you will pick three or four fewer flowers at a time. Luo Guizhen also has an experience, that is, in the morning, when the leaves are wet with dew and not easy to fall off, she picks boldly; at noon, when the leaves are dry, she picks from bottom to top to avoid knocking off the leaves. In addition, her hands are dexterous, so the speed is much faster than others, and she picks cleanly."
    Luo Guizhen participated in the construction of the farm in 1954 and has been a cotton-picking expert, and has been rated as an advanced producer every year. Last year, she created the highest record in the entire management office, picking 798 jin of cotton per day, and drove many young men and women who competed with her to improve their cotton-picking skills. Because of her all-round progress, she was accepted as a probationary member of the Communist Party of China at the end of 1958.
    When cotton harvesting began this year, she and three girls from the team, Yang Xiuge, Zhou Lize, and Ren Qin, formed a cotton-picking commando team and issued battle reports to various farms, proposing a target of 700 jin of cotton per person per day. Many production teams also put forward the slogan "Catch up with Luo Guizhen, surpass Luo Guizhen." Not long ago, Wang Xiurong of the Sixth Production Team of the First Farm created a new record of picking 803 jin per day. After the news came, she convened the group overnight to study and submitted a guarantee to the Party branch to "Catch up with Wang Xiurong and break through 800 jin."
    A new battle began. Before dawn, the cotton pickers went to the ground. Luo Guizhen's group of four were earlier than anyone else. When the sun just rose, they had picked several bags. By the time the sun set, Luo Guizhen had exceeded 1,000 jin. In this way, the average cotton picking of this group reached 942 jin per person on that day, and Luo Guizhen personally reached 1,511 jin.

### 棉田里的女英雄  罗桂珍一天摘棉一千五百一十一斤

　　棉田里的女英雄
    罗桂珍一天摘棉一千五百一十一斤
    在新疆玛纳斯河流域准噶尔盆地的棉田里，遍地银花怒放，白光闪闪，成千上万的职工正在夜以继日地与天争棉。
    我到达石河子垦区的当天，垦区党委号召全体职工投入抢收霜前花的紧急电话会议刚开过，各个机关的干部全都下地参加抢棉战斗去了。棉田里红旗招展，歌声和笑声激荡着，男女职工三、四个人各分一组，班与班、组与组开展了摘棉竞赛。他们胸前挂着白色的花包，小心而又敏捷地用两只手同时采摘棉花。在这场竞赛中，出现了无数的摘棉能手，其中成绩最显著的要算罗桂珍。在一般情况下，每人每天摘棉二百斤左右，而罗桂珍却创造了一千五百一十一斤的新纪录。
    我和党支部书记于金泉来到棉田的时候，罗桂珍正在领导一个组包干突击一块棉田。这个短发的姑娘，她的两只细长的手，像河里的游鱼一样迅速地穿插在密密麻麻的棉株间，右手刚刚擒到一朵花，左手已经伸到第二朵花上，她的眼睛始终没有离开过两只手，并且不时的用嘴咬掉落在花絮上的碎叶子。于支书对我说：“这是她们创造的快速摘棉法，如果用手去摘掉棉絮上的叶子，一次要少摘三、四朵花。罗桂珍还有一个经验，就是早上叶子被露水打湿，不易脱落，就大胆摘；中午叶子干，就从下面往上摘，避免碰落叶子。再加上她的双手灵巧，因而速度比别人快得多，摘得也干净。”
    罗桂珍从1954年参加农场建设，就是摘花能手，年年被评为先进生产者。去年，她创造了全管理处最高纪录，日摘棉花七百九十八斤，并且带动了许多和她竞赛的男女青年提高了摘花技术。由于她各方面先进，1958年底被接收为中国共产党的预备党员。
    今年开始收棉花时，她又和队里的杨秀阁、周立泽、任琴三个姑娘组成了摘棉花突击组，向各农场下了战表，提出每人日摘棉花七百斤的指标。很多生产队也提出了“赶上罗桂珍、超过罗桂珍”的口号。不久以前，第一农场第六生产队王秀荣创造了日摘棉八百零三斤的新纪录。消息传来以后，她就连夜召集小组研究，向党支部提出了“赶上王秀荣、突破八百斤”的保证书。
    新的战斗开始了。天还不亮，摘棉花的人就都下了地。罗桂珍小组四人比谁都早，太阳刚升起，她们就摘了好几袋了。到太阳下山的时候，罗桂珍已经超过一千斤。就这样，这个小组当天摘花平均每人达到九百四十二斤，罗桂珍个人达到一千五百一十一斤。
