　　Launching a Labor Emulation Drive to Dedicate Achievements to the Party Congress
　　Hungarian Industrial and Agricultural Production Rises Sharply
　　(Our newspaper's dispatch from Budapest, October 16th) The entire membership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the people of the whole country are actively and enthusiastically preparing for and welcoming the Party's Seventh Congress. The political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses are higher than ever.
　　Since the launch of the nationwide labor emulation drive in March to welcome the Party Congress, production achievements have risen sharply. In the first quarter, the average daily output of the national industrial sector increased by 5% compared to the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by 1%; while in the third quarter, the average daily output increased by 12% compared to the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by 4%.
　　The workers in all production sectors are conscientiously completing their tasks of dedicating achievements to the Party Congress, and have achieved great success in increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the metallurgical and machine-building industries overfulfilled production by 790 million forints (Hungarian currency) in the first nine months, the building materials industry overproduced by 85 million forints in the first eight months, and the workers in the high-voltage equipment industry innovated technology, produced more than 200 new products, and saved 95 million forints in production expenses. The "Pike" railcar factory proposed to save 26 million forints this year, and had completed 21 million forints by September. The Lenin Iron and Steel Works has saved 55 million forints. Machine industry and other sectors completed the original production targets for 1960 in August this year.
　　The labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers is also very high. Many state farms and agricultural production cooperatives have also launched labor emulation drives since this spring. Thanks to the farmers' hard work and the state's strong support for rural areas in terms of machinery and chemical fertilizers, the agricultural production achievements this year are also very gratifying. A communiqué from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office in the third quarter pointed out that this year's bread grains and feed grains have increased by 30% compared to last year.
　　The production achievements of state farms and agricultural production cooperatives are much better than those of individual farmers. According to an article published recently in the "Free Land Daily" by the Hungarian Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Degay, old cooperatives harvest an average of 20% to 25% more bread grains per hold than individual farmers, and newly established cooperatives harvest 10% to 15% more than individual farmers. In Győr-Sopron County, which became an agricultural cooperativization state this spring, more than 5,000 railcars of bread grains have been sold to the state so far, while only 3,200 railcars were sold to the state throughout last year.
　　Now, farmers in various places are actively carrying out autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, and are proposing to lay a good foundation for next year's bumper harvest.
　　At the end of September, the Central Committee of the Party successively issued instructions on the Seventh Party Congress and the Second Five-Year Plan, pointing out that in the next few years, the foundation of socialism should be completed and the socialist construction should be accelerated in Hungary, and called on all party members and working people to further tap production potential, give full play to their greatest wisdom, to complete the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) ahead of schedule, and create a higher starting point for the Second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965).
　　These two instructions gave great encouragement to the people of the whole country. Party organizations at all levels and the people of the whole country are widely discussing these two instructions. Now, many production sectors have put forward new tasks of increasing production and practicing economy. Enterprises producing chemical fertilizers originally planned to overproduce nearly 50,000 tons of chemical fertilizers this year, but now they have proposed to increase another 9,000 tons. The Martin furnace workers of the Lenin Iron and Steel Works originally planned to overproduce 21,000 tons of steel, but now they have proposed to increase another 1,500 tons of steel. The Budapest Metal and Machine Tool Factory decided to hold a "Party Congress Month" in November, striving to overfulfill various guarantees, and change the original guarantee of overproducing 2 million forints of products to 3 million forints; implement many new technical measures, improve labor productivity, and complete the export task one month ahead of schedule. The miners of the No. 15 mine in Totobányo are determined to bring the level of labor productivity to the 1960 target before the opening of the Party Congress. All members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the broad masses of Hungarian workers hope to do their best to create brilliant labor achievements, dedicate achievements to the Party Congress, strive for the winning red flag of the labor emulation drive, and accelerate socialist construction.

### 开展劳动竞赛　向党代会献礼  匈牙利工农业生产直线上升

　　开展劳动竞赛　向党代会献礼
    匈牙利工农业生产直线上升
    本报布达佩斯16日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党全体党员和全国人民，正在积极热烈地准备和迎接党的第七次代表大会。广大群众的政治热情和劳动干劲空前高涨。
    自从今年3月在全国展开迎接党代会的劳动竞赛后，生产成绩便直线上升。第一季度全国工业部门的平均日产量比去年同时期提高5％，劳动生产率提高1％；而第三季度的平均日产量便比去年同时期提高12％，劳动生产率提高4％。
    各生产部门的职工，都认真地完成着他们提出的向党代会的献礼任务，在增产节约方面取得了很大的成绩。例如，冶金和机器制造工业前九个月已超额生产了价值七亿九千万福林（匈币）的产品，建筑材料工业前八个月已超计划多生产了价值八千五百万福林的产品，高电压设备工业部门的职工们革新了技术，生产了二百多种新产品，节约了九千五百万福林的生产开支。皮克车皮工厂提出今年要节约二千六百万福林，在9月份已完成了二千一百万福林。列宁钢铁厂已节约了五千五百万福林。机器工业等部门在今年8月份已完成了原订1960年的生产指标。
    广大农民的劳动热情也很高。很多国营农场和农业生产合作社，今春以来也互相展开了劳动竞赛。由于农民们辛勤的劳动和国家在机器、化肥等方面对农村的大力支持，今年农业方面的生产成绩也是非常令人喜悦的。匈牙利中央统计局第三季度的公报指出，今年面包谷物和饲料谷物都比去年增产了30％。
    国营农场和农业生产合作社的生产成绩比个体农民好得多。据匈牙利农业部部长德盖伊最近在“自由土地报”上发表的文章说，老合作社面包谷物每霍尔特平均要比个体农民多收获20％到25％，新成立的合作社比个体农民多收获10％到15％。在春季已成为农业合作化州的吉厄尔—索普伦州，到现在为止，已卖给国家五千多车皮的面包谷物，而去年全年卖给国家的只有三千二百车皮。
    现在各地农民正在积极进行秋收、秋耕和秋播工作，并且提出要为明年的丰收打下良好的基础。
    党中央委员会9月底先后发布了关于第七次党代表大会和第二个五年计划的指示，指出今后几年内在匈牙利要完成社会主义的奠基工作和加速社会主义建设，并号召全体党员和劳动人民进一步发掘生产潜力，发挥最大的智慧，来提前完成三年计划（1958—1960年）为第二个五年（1961—1965年）计划创造更高的起点。
    这两个指示给予了全国人民以极大的鼓舞。各级党组织和全国人民，正在广泛讨论这两个指示。现在很多生产部门又纷纷提出了新的增产节约任务，生产化学肥料的企业原订今年要超额增产近五万吨化学肥料，现在又提出要再增加九千吨。列宁钢铁厂马丁炉工人原订超额生产两万一千吨钢材，现在又提出增加一千五百吨钢材。布达佩斯金属和机床工厂决定在11月举行“党代表大会月”，争取超额完成各种保证，并把原订超额生产二百万福林产品的保证，改为三百万福林；实行许多新的技术措施，提高劳动生产率，提前一个月完成出口任务。托托巴尼奥十五号矿井的矿工们，决心在党代会召开前使劳动生产率的水平达到1960年的指标。匈牙利社会主义工人党的全体党员和匈牙利广大的劳动者，都希望尽自己最大的努力创造辉煌的劳动成绩，向党代会献礼，争取劳动竞赛的优胜红旗，加速社会主义的建设。
