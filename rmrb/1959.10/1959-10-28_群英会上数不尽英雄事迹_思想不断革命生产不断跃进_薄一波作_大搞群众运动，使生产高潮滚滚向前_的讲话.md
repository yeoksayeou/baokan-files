Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: The heroic figures attending the National "Gathering of Heroes" today began to report to the Party and the state on their great achievements in the Great Leap Forward. The representatives' speeches at the conference fully demonstrated that the red flag of the General Line is being raised higher and higher throughout the country, and the upsurge of the leap forward on the economic construction front is rising wave upon wave.

Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the conference today entitled "Launch Mass Movements to Push the Production Upsurge Rolling Forward." The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army delivered a congratulatory message to the conference.

A total of sixteen representatives spoke at the conference today. Some of them came from the steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces in Shanghai, Benxi, Ma'anshan, Jinan and other places; some came from coal mines in Fuxin, Pingxiang, Huainan and other places; some were builders of the great capital, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base, and new railways; and some were Party committee secretaries, factory directors, workshop directors, ordinary workers, and representatives of advanced collectives on the commercial front. The speeches of the representatives from various fronts fully demonstrated that this year China's various construction undertakings are continuing to leap forward in a comprehensive manner with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Some of the representatives' speech titles were "Long Live High Speed," some were "Always Be Shock Brigades in the Great Leap Forward," and some were "Always Move Forward, Great Leap Forward Every Year." Their bold language collectively demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Chinese working class.

The red flag on the steel front—Li Weigong, a representative from the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, reported to the conference that although the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant is still the most poorly equipped steel plant in Shanghai, as a result of resolutely implementing the General Line and launching mass movements, without adding manpower or equipment, the plant's steel production in the fourth quarter of 1958 increased by one times compared with the same period in 1957, and from January to September this year, it increased by 68% compared with the same period last year. The quality of steel has also been continuously improved, and the consumption of raw materials has been continuously reduced, achieving a comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, and low consumption. Li Weigong said that the facts of the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant's Great Leap Forward last year and its continued Great Leap Forward this year fully prove that: there is no limit to enthusiasm, and there is no end to striving for the best. The General Line concentrates the will of the broad masses of working people, and adhering to the General Line means victory.

The Xieji Coal Mine No. 2 of Huainan Coal Mine broke through the design capacity of 900,000 tons in last year's Great Leap Forward, reaching 1.14 million tons; this year, there has been an even greater leap forward situation, and there is full confidence in producing 2 million tons of coal. Zhao Chengen, a representative of this advanced collective, pointed out at the conference today that the great achievements created by all the employees of their mine have powerfully refuted the erroneous view of right-leaning opportunists that there cannot be a leap forward every year. Liu Benkun, a pneumatic pick operator from Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi, introduced that his coal mining team had overfulfilled this year's production plan 80 days ahead of schedule, and had created ten new coal mining records in the first nine months of this year.

Zhang Baifa, the captain of the steel reinforcement worker youth commando team of the Beijing No. 3 Construction Engineering Company, who participated in the construction project of the Great Hall of the People, said in his speech that they never dared to dream of such a technically complex and advanced design building like the Great Hall of the People in the past, but under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, and after 14,000 construction workers worked hard and skillfully for 300 days, this magnificent project was completed. This is ironclad evidence of the Great Leap Forward and high speed, and a great victory for the General Line. In the construction process of the Great Hall of the People, Zhang Baifa's steel reinforcement team repeatedly made remarkable achievements and won the Excellent Red Flag. The Yang Liandi company of the Railway Corps, which has been holding the red flag of heroes for ten years and has built thirty-nine bridges of various sizes, today reported their new achievements to the conference by the company commander Hu Zhanfang. He said that encouraged by the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they had overfulfilled the road construction task by 58.9% in the great battle of September and October, and were determined to complete the annual task 20 days ahead of schedule.

The representatives all emphasized in their speeches that only continuous ideological revolution can lead to continuous production leap forward. Since the Party Central Committee issued instructions to oppose right-leaning and boost enthusiasm, new upsurges in production and construction have emerged throughout the country. The No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company has carried out five struggles against right-leaning conservative ideology in last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's continued leap forward, adhered to the implementation of the General Line, thus continuously refreshing the production records of the two blast furnaces that people called "old and toothless," and maintained the leading position in the utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the country for 18 consecutive months. Peng Shihua, a representative of this advanced unit, said in his speech today that their struggle practice has proved a truth: whenever the Party's General Line is implemented, and the opposition to right-leaning and boosting enthusiasm is firmly grasped, the mass movement will be vigorous and production will flourish. Since Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine was put into production in 1953, it has overfulfilled the production plan every year. Xie Tianrong, a representative of this mine, introduced at the meeting that since mid-July this year, the Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine has launched an anti-rightist struggle throughout the mine with swift and decisive action. In August, it not only overcame the attack of the largest rainstorm in six years, but also overfulfilled the task. In September, it overfulfilled the task every day, and a brand-new situation of "a red start, daily red, ten-day red, and a full month of red" appeared, eliminating serious injuries. Labor productivity and cost plans were also completed better month by month.

Representatives from small and medium-sized enterprises stated at the meeting that as a result of adhering to the Party's policy of walking on two legs, small and medium-sized enterprises in various places are also in excellent condition and are playing a huge role in China's socialist construction. The No. 2 small blast furnace of the No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company in Anhui was built in 20 days during last year's Great Leap Forward. Since it was put into production, it has produced a total of 4,883 tons of high-quality pig iron for the country in eleven months. The average qualified rate of pig iron reached 98.4%, and the cost of each ton of pig iron was only 149 yuan. Due to the continuous increase in production, this small blast furnace has completed this year's national plan five months and twelve days ahead of schedule. Zhang Guangquan, the foreman of this red flag blast furnace, said at the meeting today: Our small blast furnace is only one of many small blast furnaces in the country, and our achievements are only a small part of the great achievements of the mass steelmaking. The right-leaning opportunists clamored that "small blast furnaces have high costs and waste a lot, outweighing the gains," which is a blatant lie.

We want to tell them loudly: small blast furnaces are by no means have gains and losses, let alone outweigh the gains, but are very good. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee’s Ironmaking Experimental Plant is a small-scale ironmaking plant run by government officials. From January to September this year, it produced a total of 9,269 tons of pig iron, overfulfilling the state-assigned plan by 21%. Since the four small blast furnaces in the plant were put into production, the production has been very normal, and the lowest has been continuous production for more than seven months without major repairs. The average qualified rate of pig iron has reached 83.33%, and it has been continuously rated as an advanced unit in Shandong Province and Jinan City.

Yuan Wenzhou, a representative of Xiaodian People's Commune in Yanjin County, Henan, reported to the conference on the great achievements of their commune in running industry. He said that before the establishment of the Xiaodian People's Commune, there was only one iron industry cooperative, one pottery cooperative, and one woodworking group, which could only produce some small tools. After the commune ran industry, there are now 98 factories such as machinery manufacturing, repair, fertilizer, papermaking, and leather, with more than 950 employees, ten times more than before the commune. These commune-run industries have played a major role in supporting agricultural production, serving the lives of the masses, and increasing commune accumulation. Yuan Wenzhou said enthusiastically: "Only communization has created conditions for rural industrialization. No matter how the reactionary factions at home and abroad and the right-leaning opportunists spread rumors and slanders, our 650 million people firmly believe that the people's commune is indeed good and truly good. The people's commune will definitely be better and more prosperous."

The Ma Hengchang advanced group of the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, which completed 14 years of work during the first five-year plan, reported to the conference today by their representative Wang Liangui, saying that their group completed one year and ten months of workload in 1958, and completed fifteen months of workload in the first nine months of this year. Now they are doing the work of 1970. Zhao Cai, the foreman of the Second Engineering Section of the Second Team of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company’s Furnace Construction Company, said that they had built two open-hearth furnace chimneys as high as 100 meters in fourteen and twelve days respectively this year, creating the highest record in the country. Liu Baozhong, director of the power workshop of Tianjin Chemical Plant, reported on the important achievements made by their workshop in technical innovation. Liu Guangjin, a stoker in the boiler workshop of Shijingshan Power Plant, who created a new record for safe production, Xiao Peijun, a car driver of the Shaoyang District Highway Transportation Bureau of Hunan, and Cui Guangcheng, a representative of the red flag unit on the commercial front, Beijing Tianqiao Shopping Mall, also spoke at today's conference. The speeches of all the representatives today aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The conference will continue tomorrow.

    群英会上数不尽英雄事迹
    思想不断革命生产不断跃进
    薄一波作“大搞群众运动，使生产高潮滚滚向前”的讲话
    新华社27日讯　出席全国“群英会”的英雄人物，今天开始向党和国家汇报他们在大跃进中创造的丰功伟绩。代表们在大会上的发言，充分表明总路线的红旗正在全国各地越举越高，经济建设战线上的跃进高潮，正在一浪高过一浪。
    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波今天在大会上作了题为“大搞群众运动，使生产高潮滚滚向前”的讲话，中国人民解放军总政治部向大会致了贺词。
    今天在大会上发言的共有十六位代表。他们有的来自上海、本溪、马鞍山、济南等地的炼钢和炼铁炉旁，有的来自阜新、萍乡、淮南等地煤矿矿井，有的是伟大首都、武汉钢铁基地和新建铁路的建设者，有的是工厂的党委书记、厂长、车间主任、普通工人和商业战线上先进集体的代表。各个战线上的代表们的发言，充分表明今年我国各项建设事业正在继续多快好省地全面跃进。代表们发言的题目有的是“高速度万岁”，有的是“永远作大跃进的突击队”，有的是“永远向前进，年年大跃进”。他们的豪迈语言，集中地表现了我国工人阶级的英雄气概。
    钢铁战线上的红旗——上海第六钢铁厂的代表李唯功向大会报告说，上钢六厂虽然至今仍是上海所有钢铁厂中设备最简陋的一个，但是由于坚决贯彻总路线和大搞群众运动的结果，在不添人、不增设备的条件下，这个厂的钢产量在1958年第四季度就比1957年同期增加了一倍，今年1至9月又比去年同期增长68％，钢的质量也不断提高，原材料消耗不断下降，达到了高产、优质、低耗的全面跃进。李唯功说，上钢六厂去年大跃进和今年继续大跃进的事实充分证明：干劲无穷尽，上游无止境，总路线集中反映了广大劳动人民的意志，坚持总路线就是胜利。
    淮南煤矿谢家集二矿在去年大跃进中突破了年产九十万吨的设计能力，使煤产量达到一百一十四万吨；今年又出现了更大跃进的局面，完全有把握产煤二百万吨。这个先进集体的代表赵承恩今天在大会上指出，他们矿全体职工创造的巨大成绩，有力地驳斥了右倾机会主义者认为不能年年跃进的谬论。江西萍乡煤矿风镐手刘本坤介绍说，他所在的采煤小组，已经提前八十天超额完成今年的生产计划，并且在今年前九个多月内创造了十次采煤新纪录。
    参加过人民大会堂建设工程的北京市第三建筑工程公司钢筋工青年突击队队长张百发在发言中说，像人民大会堂这样技术复杂、设计先进的建筑物，过去他们连做梦也不敢想，而在总路线的光辉照耀下，经过一万四千名建筑工人大干巧干三百天，这个宏伟工程就全部建成了。这是大跃进和高速度的铁的证据，是总路线的伟大胜利。在人民大会堂的建设过程中，张百发钢筋队曾经屡建奇功，获得优胜红旗。十年来一直高举着英雄的红旗，修架了三十九座大小桥梁的铁道兵杨连第连，今天由连长胡占芳向大会报告了他们的新成就。他说，在党的八届八中全会公报鼓舞下，他们在大战9、10月中已经超额58.9％完成了筑路任务，并且决心提前二十天完成全年任务。
    代表们在发言中都着重指出，只有思想不断革命才有生产不断跃进。自从党中央发出反右倾、鼓干劲的指示以后，全国各地都出现了新的生产建设高潮。本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂在去年大跃进和今年的继续跃进中进行了五次反对右倾保守思想的斗争，坚持贯彻总路线，因而使两座被人们称做“老掉了牙”的高炉的产量纪录不断刷新，连续十八个月保持了全国大中型高炉利用系数的领先地位。这个先进单位的代表彭石华今天在发言中说，他们的斗争实践证明了一个真理：什么时候贯彻了党的总路线，抓紧了反对右倾、鼓干劲，什么时候群众运动就轰轰烈烈，生产就蒸蒸日上。阜新海州露天煤矿自从1953年投入生产以来，年年超额完成生产计划。这个矿的代表谢天荣在会上介绍说，今年7月中旬以来，海州露天煤矿雷厉风行地在全矿展开了反右倾斗争，8月份不仅战胜了六年来从未遇到过的特大暴雨的袭击，而且超额完成了任务；9月份又天天超额完成任务，出现了“开门红、日日红、旬旬红、全月满堂红”的崭新局面，消灭了重伤事故，劳动生产率和成本计划也都完成得一月比一月好。
    来自中小企业的代表，在会上畅述了由于坚持贯彻党的两条腿走路方针的结果，各地中小企业也是一片大好形势，在我国社会主义建设中发挥着巨大作用。安徽马鞍山钢铁公司炼铁一厂二号小高炉是在去年大跃进中用二十天的时间建立起来的，自从投入生产以来，十一个月中共为国家生产了四千八百八十三吨优质生铁，生铁的平均合格率达到98.4％，每吨生铁的成本只有一百四十九元。由于产量不断提高，这座小高炉已经提前五个月零十二天完成了今年国家计划。这个红旗高炉的工长张广全今天在会上说：我们的小高炉只是全国许多小高炉中的一个，我们的成绩不过是大炼钢铁伟大成绩中的一个很小部分。右倾机会主义分子叫嚷“小高炉成本高、浪费大，得不偿失”，这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    我们要大声告诉他们：小高炉决不是有得有失，更不是得不偿失，而是好得很，中共山东省委和省人民委员会机关炼铁试验厂是由机关干部办的小型炼铁厂，今年1至9月共出产生铁九千二百六十九吨，超额21％完成了国家分配的计划。全厂四座小高炉从投入生产以来，生产十分正常，最低的连续生产七个月以上没有进行大修，生铁合格率平均达到83.33％，连续被评为山东省和济南市的先进单位。
    河南延津县小店人民公社代表袁文周向大会汇报了他们公社办工业的巨大成就。他说，小店人民公社在未建社前，仅有一个铁业社、窑业社和一个木业组，只能生产一些小件工具，公社办工业后，目前已经有机械制造、修配、化肥、造纸、皮革等九十八个工厂，职工九百五十多人，比公社化前翻了十番，这些社办工业在支援农业生产、服务群众生活以及增加公社积累等方面都起了重大的作用。袁文周热情地说：“只有人民公社化才给农村工业化创造了条件。不管国内外反动派和右倾机会主义分子怎样造谣污蔑，我们六亿五千万人民坚决相信人民公社的的确确好，实实在在好。人民公社一定越办越好越兴旺。”
    在第一个五年计划期间完成了十四年工作量的齐齐哈尔第二机床厂马恒昌先进小组，今天由他们的代表王连贵向大会报告说：他们小组1958年完成了一年零十个月的工作量，今年头九个月又完成十五个月的工作量，现在他们已经做着1970年的工作。武钢筑炉公司二队二工段工长赵才说，他们在今年先后以十四天和十二天的时间，建成了两座高达一百米的平炉烟囱，创造了全国最高纪录。天津化工厂动力车间主任刘宝忠报告了他们车间在技术革新方面取得的重要成绩。在今天大会上发言的，还有创造安全生产新纪录的石景山发电厂锅炉车间司炉刘光金，湖南邵阳专区公路运输局汽车驾驶员萧培俊，以及商业战线上的红旗单位——北京市天桥商场的代表崔广成。今天所有代表的发言，都激起了全场热烈的掌声。
    明天，大会将继续举行。
