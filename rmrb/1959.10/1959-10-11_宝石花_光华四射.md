　　"The Stone Flower" Shines Brightly
　　Jia Zuoguang
    It is truly fortunate to be able to see the performance of the ballet troupe of the Bolshoi Theatre of the Soviet Union during the great festival of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our nation. It is an immense pleasure to have world-renowned ballet master and People's Artist of the USSR Galina Ulanova, People's Artist of the USSR and conductor Yuri Fayer, as well as Olga Lepeshinskaya, Maya Plisetskaya, Konstantin Sergeyev, and other masters participate in the performances.
    I am honored to have been able to see the last work of the late, outstanding Soviet composer Sergei Prokofiev—the ballet "The Stone Flower"—and felt as sweet as if I had drunk a cup of nectar. After watching this ballet, which has mythological overtones, a rich fantastic mood, and is picturesque, I was captivated by the beautiful performance and remained restless for a long time.
    The reason "The Stone Flower" makes such a strong impression on people is that the work beautifully expresses a theme with profound ideological significance—the idea of engaging in labor and creation for the happiness of mankind. It demonstrates the immense creative power of the Soviet people and their determination to conquer nature. Therefore, the endless treasures of the earth can radiate infinite light in the face of working people.
    In this performance of "The Stone Flower," Danila is played by dancer Vladimir Vasiliev, Katerina is played by young dancer Yekaterina Maksimova, the Mistress of the Copper Mountain is played by People's Artist of the USSR Maya Plisetskaya, and Severian is played by Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Vladimir Levashev. Plisetskaya perfectly portrays the image of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. She transforms from a lizard in one moment to a malachite maiden in the next; she demonstrates the majesty of the ruler of treasures and the charm of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. When she punishes the cruel ruler Severian, she is so stern and decisive, and when she falls in love with Danila, she is so gentle and graceful. She fully reveals the character's personality through dance movements. Every dance combination, whether allegro or adagio, has precise movements. The swinging of her arms is like golden waves, powerful yet soft; the jumps or grand jetés on one leg are like a petrel flying in the ocean, stretched out and free, and the stillness after rapid spins is especially satisfying. Surprisingly, in these light, agile, and flexible movements, she gives us spiritual enjoyment. She conquers the stage space with her dance art skills, and she conquers the audience. The Mistress of the Copper Mountain she portrays has a distinct personality. The dance movements when she transforms into the malachite maiden have the feeling of prismatic and sharp crystals, making it seem as if the gemstones are truly sparkling. When she pours out her heart to Danila in that pas de deux, it almost makes one forget that she is the Mistress of the Copper Mountain, and she becomes a truly humane woman infatuated with love. She fully expresses the inner feelings of the character with her artistic skills. Her light dance postures express the content of the music and are full of moving power.
    The performance of the genius Yekaterina Maksimova is admirable. Especially the pas de deux with the Flame Maiden to find Danila is so intriguing. There is not much complicated technique here; what runs through the dance is the extremely distinct musical language of the composer depicting a mischievous and innocent maiden. Here, the combination with folk dance also leaves a deep impression on people. When she finds Danila and the Mistress of the Copper Mountain dancing together, it is an extremely moving scene. The Mistress of the Copper Mountain conquers Danila's heart with her strong personality, while Katerina fights the Mistress of the Copper Mountain for her own love. Vasiliev's performance as Danila is successful. He does not show disgust for the Mistress of the Copper Mountain, but rather expresses respect for her, allowing one to see Danila's friendship with the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. The unwavering love of the two young people makes the Mistress of the Copper Mountain change her expectations. She does not harm this happy couple, but helps them in the struggle and severely punishes the oppressor Severian, letting the earth swallow him up. Vasiliev's performance is astonishing. His continuous aerial jumps and turns are like a gust of wind and lightning. These swift movements, in portraying the image of Danila, a working person, show the strong and simple character of the Russian people.
    The outstanding performance of Honored Artist Vladimir Levashev sets an example for us in creating dance images of negative characters. He dances with the Gypsies at the market, combining dance combinations with his character's traits, and his profound performance incisively and vividly portrays this negative character. There is no exaggeration or affectation here, but rather a creative artistic approach, which is in stark contrast to the positive characters. The Russian maiden dance, the round dance, the Gypsy dance, and so on interspersed in the play are all very folk-like and have a Ural flavor.
    This ballet has a unique style and strong national characteristics. All the images have strong vitality. Because the music of this ballet is very danceable, the music lays a sufficient length of time and scope of activity for the dance, giving the choreographer great conditions for creating dance. This is indeed a wonderful masterpiece. In particular, the rich dance vocabulary finds the best expressive dance techniques, which run through the entire ballet. Here, one cannot see lengthy mime scenes and simple technical performances, but rather the use of dance to explain the story and express the theme.
    The beautiful stage art is the creative achievement of the artist. It makes the performance rich in color and moving in its atmosphere. It allows the actors to use the stage space to develop the dance in a specific typical environment, and it also allows the audience to obtain a sense of reality, as if they were on the scene.
    The success of the ballet "The Stone Flower" is a miracle in artistic creation. This is a fruitful fruit in the world of ballet art, truly as radiant as a gemstone.

　　“宝石花”光华四射
　　贾作光
    在我国人民热烈欢庆建国十周年的伟大的节日里，能够看到苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团的演出，真是令人十分庆幸的事。特别是世界闻名的芭蕾舞大师、苏联人民演员加·乌兰诺娃，以及苏联人民演员、乐队指挥尤·菲·法耶尔，还有奥·列皮辛斯卡娅、玛·米·普利谢茨卡娅、康·谢尔盖耶夫等大师们参加演出，使我们感到莫大的幸福。
    我很荣幸地能够看到已故的杰出的苏联作曲家谢·普罗科菲耶夫最后的一部作品——舞剧“宝石花”，就像饮了一杯甘露那样觉得香甜。当我看完这出带有神话色彩的、富有幻想意境、如诗如画的舞剧时，我被这优美的表演所吸引，心情久久不能平静。
    “宝石花”所以给人们强烈的印象，是由于作品优美地表现了含有深刻思想意义的主题——为了人类幸福从事劳动创造的思想。它显示了苏联人民的巨大的创造力量和征服自然的决心，因而大地的无尽宝藏在劳动人民面前能够放射出万丈光芒。
    在这一次演出的“宝石花中，”达尼拉是由舞蹈家弗·维·瓦西里耶夫扮演，卡杰里娜是由青年舞蹈家叶·谢·玛克辛莫娃扮演，铜山公主是由苏联人民演员玛·米·普利谢茨卡娅扮演，谢维里扬是由俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋演员弗·亚·列瓦绍夫扮演。普利谢茨卡娅完美地塑造了铜山公主的形象。她一会儿变成了一条蜥蜴，刹那间又变成了一个孔雀石姑娘；她表现了宝藏的统治者的威严，又表现了铜山公主的魅力。当她惩罚残暴的谢维里扬这个统治者时，她是那么严厉和果断，当她爱上达尼拉的时候又表现得那样柔美、婉转。她以舞蹈动作充分地揭示了角色的性格。每个舞蹈的组合，无论是快板或者慢板，它们的动作都是准确的。她那双臂的摆动有如金黄色的波浪，有力而又柔软；双腿跳跃或是单腿大跳好像在海洋中飞翔着的海燕，舒展而又自如，特别是急速旋转后的静止使人感到很大的满足。令人惊奇的是，在这轻快，敏捷，灵活的运动中，她给了我们精神上美的享受，她用舞蹈艺术技巧征服了舞台空间，而且征服了观众。她所塑造的铜山公主有着鲜明的个性，她变成孔雀石姑娘的舞蹈动作有棱形而尖硬的水晶体的感觉，使人好像看到宝石真正在闪闪发光。当她爱上达尼拉倾诉衷肠那段双人舞，简直使人忘记她是铜山公主，而成为真正有人情味的被爱情所迷恋的女性，她用自己的艺术技巧充分地表现出人物的内心情感。她那轻巧的舞蹈造型，表现了音乐的内容，充满了感人力量。
    天才的叶·谢·玛克辛莫娃的表演是令人敬佩的。特别是她和火焰姑娘去寻找达尼拉的一段双人舞是多么耐人寻味。这里没有更多的复杂技术，贯穿在舞蹈中的是作曲家描绘调皮天真烂漫的少女形象的极其鲜明的音乐语言。在这里，和民间舞蹈的结合也给人们留下了深刻的印象。当她找到了达尼拉和铜山公主一起跳的一段三人舞是极其动人的场面，铜山公主以强烈的个性去征服达尼拉的心，而卡杰里娜为了自己的爱情向铜山公主进行了斗争。扮演达尼拉的瓦西里耶夫的表演是成功的，他没有对铜山公主表示厌恶，相反地表示了对她的尊重，使人可以看出达尼拉对铜山公主的友谊。两位青年的坚贞不屈的爱情使铜山公主改变了自己的想望，她没有伤害这一对幸福的伴侣，而是在斗争中帮助了他们，并且严厉惩罚了压迫者谢维里扬，让大地把他吞噬了。瓦西里耶夫的表演是惊人的，他的连续空中跳和回身旋跳有犹如急风和闪电，这些迅速的动作在塑造达尼拉这个劳动人民的形象上，显示了俄罗斯人的坚强纯朴的性格。
    功勋演员弗·亚·列瓦绍夫杰出的表演，给我们树立了创造反面人物舞蹈形象的卓越才能。他在集市上和吉卜赛人一同舞蹈，结合着他的角色特性舞蹈组合，加上他的深刻表演，把这个反面人物刻划得淋漓尽致。这里没有浮夸和造作，而是以艺术的创造性的手法处理的，和正面人物有着鲜明的对比。剧中穿插的俄罗斯少女舞、环舞、吉卜赛舞等等都极有民间色彩和乌拉尔的情调。
    这个舞剧具有独特风格和浓厚的民族色彩。所有的形象都有着强烈的生命力。由于这部舞剧音乐的舞蹈性很强，音乐给舞蹈奠定了足够的时间长度和活动范围，使编导有很大的创造舞蹈的条件。这的确是一个绝妙的佳作，特别是丰富的舞蹈语汇，找到了最好的表情的舞蹈手法，贯穿在整个舞剧中。这里看不到冗长的哑剧场面和单纯技术表演，而是用舞蹈来说明故事，表现主题。
    优美的舞台美术是美术家的创造性的成就，它使演出富有浓厚的色彩和动人的境界。使演员在特定的典型环境中，利用舞台空间去发挥舞蹈；而且使观众也能获得一种真实感，好像身临其境。
    舞剧“宝石花”的成功是艺术创造中的奇迹。这是世界舞剧艺术中的一个丰硕的果实，真如宝石般光华四射。
