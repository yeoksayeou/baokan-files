Xinhua News Agency, 1st – A grand National Day military parade was held at Tiananmen Square today. The heroic People's Liberation Army (PLA) ground, naval, and air forces, in magnificent formation, marched through Tiananmen Square to receive the review.

At approximately 10:00 AM, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, Marshal Lin Biao, accompanied by Parade Commander General Yang Yong, slowly reviewed the parading troops along the south side of Tiananmen Square and East Chang'an Avenue. During the review, Marshal Lin Biao repeatedly shouted "Long Live the People's Republic of China!" "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" The parading troops responded with "Long Live! Long Live! Long Live!" fully demonstrating the infinite loyalty of the officers and soldiers of the three services to the motherland, the Party, and the leader. Then, Marshal Lin Biao ascended the Tiananmen rostrum to read the order of the Ministry of National Defense.

The march-past began. The "August 1st" military flag, fluttering in the wind, led the ranks of military academies and schools of infantry, artillery, engineering, tanks, aviation, railway corps, and the navy, first entering Tiananmen Square. They marched in twenty-four columns, spirited and marching in unison. Leading the way were Major Generals Wu Huaduo and Hu Dingqian, veterans of the Second Revolutionary Civil War. These two close old comrades-in-arms fought side by side during the Long March and the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today, they again marched side by side across Tiananmen Square.

The great motherland, leaping forward towards industrialization, has given the People's Liberation Army various modern weapons and equipment. The newest automatic rifles, cannons, tanks, and high-speed jet fighters in the equipment of the reviewed units are all manufactured in our own country.

The guardians of our great motherland's vast territorial waters – naval officers and sailors – marched in formation through Tiananmen Square. Among them were sailors from the East Sea Fleet who had sunk or damaged over one hundred enemy ships and captured fifty; there were also sailors from the Fujian front, who, in two months last autumn, buried more than twenty Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels in the Taiwan Strait. The era when our motherland "had seas but no defense" is gone forever. The People's Navy is already a strong maritime defense force composed of various services, including a large number of surface vessels, submarines, naval aviation, and coastal artillery.

The powerful formations of well-equipped infantry, motorized infantry, and airborne troops passed by in sequence. The infantry wore steel helmets and carried automatic rifles. Their uniform pace demonstrated a high level of training. The 1st Motorized Infantry Company under review was a unit of the 1st Division of the 1st Red Army, which persisted in the Jinggangshan struggle. They forced the crossing of the Wujiang River during the Long March and participated in the Battle of Pingxingguan in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today, it has grown into a mechanized unit with a high degree of mobility.

Artillery warriors drove vehicles towing one hundred and forty-four long-range cannons of various calibers. The vast majority of these cannons are manufactured in our own country, including powerful automated anti-aircraft guns. Towed by "Type 59" tracked vehicles and ninety-nine giant tanks, the steel torrent roared past Tiananmen Square. Among the artillery units reviewed was one of the earliest heavy artillery units in the People's Liberation Army. It displayed great power in the Liaoshen Campaign and severely damaged enemy ships in the battle to liberate Hainan Island. Now, they possess new domestically-made large-caliber cannon, becoming an indestructible modern artillery force. The new types of tanks manufactured in our country, participating in the review, have excellent performance, various latest technical equipment, and powerful firepower.

As people were waving and cheering to the iron torrent in the square, one hundred and fifty-five powerful jet bombers and fighter aircraft suddenly appeared in the sky east of Tiananmen Square. These heroic war eagles, in neat formations of five aircraft, flashed by like lightning with thunderous roars. New domestically-made supersonic jet fighters showed off their might. Piloting them was one of the earliest air force divisions established in our country. Since its establishment, this division has shot down or damaged a total of eighty-eight enemy aircraft, producing more than three thousand four hundred heroes, model workers, and recipients of awards for merit. Air Force heroes Zhang Jihui, Li Han, Zou Yan, Wang Hai, Liu Yudi, and Han Decai, who shot down the so-called "first-class jet aerial hero" of the United States in 1953, were all cultivated by this unit. Now, they have become even stronger in mastering various complex flight techniques.

People continuously cheered and paid respects to the reviewed troops, warmly celebrating the glorious achievements made by the loyal defender of the motherland – the Chinese People's Liberation Army – in the construction of a modern revolutionary army.

    高举党的总路线和毛泽东军事思想的红旗
    我们的军队是不可战胜的
    陆海空三军国庆大检阅
    新华社1日讯　今天，天安门广场举行盛大国庆阅兵。英雄的人民解放军陆、海、空三军部队，以雄壮的阵容通过天安门广场，接受检阅。
    上午十时许，国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪元帅由阅兵总指挥杨勇上将陪同，乘车缓缓地沿着天安门广场南侧和东长安街，检阅各受阅部队。检阅时，林彪元帅频频高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”受阅部队齐声高呼“万岁！万岁！万岁！”充分表现了三军官兵对祖国、对党、对领袖的无限忠诚。然后，林彪元帅登上天安门城楼，宣读国防部命令。
    分列式开始了。迎风招展的“八一”军旗，引导着军事学院和步兵、炮兵、工程兵、坦克兵、航空兵、铁道兵、海军等学校的队伍，首先进入天安门广场。他们排着二十四路纵队，精神抖擞，齐步前进。走在最前面的是第二次国内战争时期的红军战士吴华夺少将和胡定千少将。这两位亲密的老战友，在长征和抗日时期都一起并肩作战。今天，他们又并肩走过天安门广场。
    向着工业化飞跃前进的伟大祖国，给了人民解放军各种现代化武器装备。受阅各部队的装备中最新式自动步枪、大炮、坦克、高速度的喷气歼击机，都是祖国制造出来的。
    我们伟大祖国万里海疆的保卫者——海军军官和水兵们列队通过天安门广场。他们当中，有击沉、击伤敌舰船一百多艘、俘获五十艘的东海舰队水兵；还有来自福建前线的水兵，他们在去年秋天的两个月里，曾把二十多艘蒋军舰艇埋葬在台湾海峡。我们祖国“有海无防”的时代一去不复返了。人民海军已经是一支拥有大量水面舰艇、水下潜艇和海军航空兵、海岸炮兵等各兵种组成的坚强的海防力量。
    装备精良的步兵、摩托步兵和空降兵等机械化部队的强大阵容循序而过。步兵头戴钢盔，手执自动步枪。整齐如一的前进步伐，充分表现高度的训练水平。受检阅的摩托化步兵第一连，是当年坚持井冈山斗争的红军第一军第一师的一个部队。他们在长征途中，强渡乌江天险；在抗日战争中参加过平型关大战。今天，它已成长为具有高度机动能力的机械化部队。
    炮兵勇士驱车牵引着一百四十四门各种口径的远射程大炮前进。这些大炮，绝大部分是我国自己制造的。其中有威力强大的自动化的高射炮。拖着大炮的“五九”式履带牵引车和九十九辆巨型坦克，它们组成的钢铁巨流，发着隆隆的巨响，来到天安门前。受检阅的炮兵部队中，有一支是人民解放军重炮兵部队中建军最早的部队。它在辽沈战役中大显神威，在解放海南岛的战役中痛击敌舰。现在，他们拥有新式国产的大口径加农大炮，成为无坚不摧的现代化炮兵。参加受检阅的我国制造的新型坦克，性能优良，有各种最新式的技术装备和强大的火力。
    当人们正向广场上的铁流招手欢呼的时候，一百五十五架强大的喷气式轰炸机和歼击机群，突然出现在天安门东方的天空。这些英雄的战鹰，排着整齐的五机编队，像闪电一般，夹着雷鸣般的吼声一闪而过。我国自己制造的新式超音速喷气歼击机，大显威风。驾驶它们的是我国空军建军最早的一个师。这个师从成立以来共击落击伤敌机八十八架，涌现出三千四百多名英雄、模范和立功受奖人员。空军英雄张积慧、李汉、邹炎、王海、刘玉堤和曾在1953年打下美国所谓“第一流喷气式空中英雄”的韩德彩，都是这个部队培育出来的。现在，他们又在掌握各种复杂的飞行技术方面，锻炼得更加坚强。
    人们不断向受阅部队欢呼致敬，热烈地庆祝祖国忠诚的保卫者——中国人民解放军在现代化革命军队的建设中，所取得的光辉成就。
