    Budapest Dispatch: Recently, Hungary established the Writers' Association. Károly, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, member of the Political Bureau, and Minister of State, spoke at the inaugural congress. He represented the Party in praising all Party and non-Party writers who were not intimidated by the threats of Western imperialists during the counter-revolutionary rebellion and who did not abandon the Party or the people during the most difficult days. Károly emphasized that the achievements in accelerating socialist construction also reflect the three years of labor by writers loyal to the Party and the people. For this, the Hungarian working class and working masses express their heartfelt praise and respect to their comrades-in-arms – the writers.

    Károly continued by saying that, in order to thoroughly reorganize the country's social and cultural life, it is necessary to re-establish the Writers' Association.

    Now we can say that the majority of writers in our country are following the Party, and some of their works, which are popular with the masses, reflect the Party's correct policies and influence. Excellent writers have successfully resumed their vocation in the cause of socialist education of the people. The majority of writers are advancing along such a correct path, becoming loyal allies of the working class, which is fighting for socialist construction.

    Károly then pointed out that there are also some writers whose worldviews and political qualities have not undergone special changes as a result of our ideological struggle. This does not indicate the weakness of our ideological work, but only proves that these writers have embarked on another path. If they cannot leave this path in time, then they will eventually become completely detached from life, from struggle, and from the achievements of the Hungarian people. We are so straightforward and somewhat rudely frank in saying this because we hope to protect them and prevent them from going down this wrong path.

    Now, when the Party and the people are united in the struggle to smash the counter-revolution, and later in the struggle to accelerate the speed of socialist construction, and when the Party has become the leader of the broadest masses, anyone who wants to leave the Party, or even stand in the opposite direction to speak for the so-called "interests" of the people, cannot call himself a "people's" writer.

    If the re-established Writers' Association wants to successfully complete the tasks before it, it must also implement the main principle of Party leadership in its own work.

    The task of the Writers' Association is to make Hungarian literature become socialist realist literature as quickly as possible. The Writers' Association must help every member and all writers master Marxist ideology.

    Károly continued by saying that, on the whole, modern Hungarian literature has not yet embarked on the path of using socialist realism as a creative method. In our era, socialist realism is a major branch on the tree of blooming Hungarian literature, but only one of the branches on this tree. In addition, there are writers and groups working with other creative methods, and their representatives also have their seats in the Writers' Association. However, the re-established Writers' Association must once and for all eradicate the idea that certain writers' groups want to have independent organizational lives. Our country, our people, provides conditions for all literary and artistic creative activities aimed at strengthening people's democracy, promoting socialist construction, improving the people's cultural level, and socialist education for the working people. The correct principle that "literary" and "artistic" activities that oppose the legitimate state system are not allowed to exist remains effective in the future.

    When talking about the issue of unity in the literary world, Károly emphasized that the re-establishment of the Writers' Association does not mean that the struggle for unity has ended. On the contrary, it elevates this struggle to a new and higher level of political and ideological struggle.

    卡洛伊在匈牙利作家协会成立大会上讲话
    作家必须掌握马克思主义思想
    本报讯　布达佩斯消息：最近匈牙利成立了作家协会。匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会书记、政治局委员、国务部长卡洛伊在成立大会上讲了话，他代表党表扬了在反革命叛乱事件中没有被西方帝国主义者的威胁吓倒、在最困难的日子里没有离开党、离开人民的一切党和非党的作家。卡洛伊强调指出，在加快社会主义建设速度的事业所取得的成就中，同样也反映出忠于党和人民的作家三年来的劳动。为此，匈牙利工人阶级、劳动群众向自己的战友——作家表示衷心的赞扬和尊敬。
    卡洛伊接着说，为了彻底整理国内的社会文化生活，必须重新成立作家协会。
    现在我们已经可以说，我国大多数作家是跟着党走的，他们写的、受到群众欢迎的一些作品中，反映了党的正确政策和党的影响。优秀的作家在对人民进行社会主义教育的事业中，重新又成功地担负起自己的天职。大多数作家都沿着这样一条正确的道路前进，成为正在为社会主义建设而斗争的工人阶级的忠实盟友。
    卡洛伊接着指出，还有这样一些作家，我们的思想斗争没有对他们的世界观和政治品质引起特殊变化。这并不表明我们思想工作的薄弱，它只证明这些作家走上了另外一条道路，如果他们不能及时离开这条道路，那末，他们在这条道路上终将完全脱离生活、脱离斗争、脱离匈牙利人民的成就。我们所以这样直爽和有些粗鲁地坦率地说出这些，是因为我们希望保护他们，使他们不错走上这条道路。
    现在，当党和人民在粉碎反革命的斗争、以及后来在加速社会主义建设速度的斗争中团结一致，并且党已成为最广大群众的领导的时候，谁要是想离开党，甚至站在与党相反的方向来为他所谓的人民“利益”讲话，谁就不能自称为是“人民”作家。
    重新成立的作家协会要想顺利地完成摆在它面前的任务，同样在自己工作中也必须实现党的领导这一主要原则。
    作家协会的任务在于使匈牙利的文学尽快地成为社会主义现实主义的文学。作家协会必须帮助每一个会员和所有的作家掌握马克思主义思想。
    卡洛伊接着说，整个说来，匈牙利现代文学还没有走上使用社会主义现实主义创作方法的道路。在我们的时代里，社会主义现实主义是匈牙利文学这棵百花盛开的树上的一根主要的枝干，但仅仅是这棵树上的枝干之一。此外，还有用其他创作方法工作的作家和团体，他们的代表在作家协会中也有自己的席位。但是，重新成立的作家协会必须一劳永逸地根除这种思想：即某些作家团体想有独立组织生活。我们的国家、我国人民是为一切旨在加强人民民主、促进社会主义建设、提高人民的文化水平和对劳动人民的社会主义教育的文学艺术创造活动提供条件的。不允许反对合法的国家制度的“文学”和“艺术”活动存在，这样一个正确原则今后仍然有效。
    卡洛伊在谈到文学界的团结问题时，强调指出，作家协会的重新成立并不意味着为团结而进行的斗争已经结束了，恰恰相反，而是把这个斗争提高到新的、更高的政治思想斗争水平上来。
