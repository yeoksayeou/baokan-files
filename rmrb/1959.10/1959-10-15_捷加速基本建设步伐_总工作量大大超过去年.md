Prague Dispatch, October 14th: This year, Czechoslovakia is further accelerating the pace of capital construction nationwide, with the total workload of capital construction exceeding last year by 12%. Construction investment directly controlled by the central government has increased by more than 30%. In the first half of this year, 101% of the plan has been completed, an increase of 16.5% compared with the same period last year. Among some of the completed and put into production projects are workshops with an annual output of 5,000 tons of steel, and chemical factories with an annual output of 8,200 tons of sulfuric acid. Currently, workers at many capital construction sites, as well as workers in factories that provide equipment and raw materials for these projects, are fighting valiantly with redoubled efforts to complete this year's capital construction tasks.
