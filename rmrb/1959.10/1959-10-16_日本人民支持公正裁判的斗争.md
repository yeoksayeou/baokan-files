The Japanese People's Struggle to Support Fair Trials
　　Lan Hai
　　In response to the Kishi Nobusuke government's activities to forcibly revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and strengthen the U.S.-Japan military alliance, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of this treaty is growing day by day. People from all walks of life in Japan are preparing to launch the seventh national unified action to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" across the country before the convening of the extraordinary session of the Diet. Prior to the seventh unified action, a movement to support "Idate Judgement, Uphold the Constitution Month" has been launched across Japan from October 10th. The "Idate Judgement" is the judgement made by Idate Akio, the presiding judge of the Tokyo District Court, on the "Sunagawa Incident," stating that "the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan is not permitted by the Japanese Constitution." On October 13th this year, Sunagawa Town in Tokyo will hold a "Support Idate Judgement, Uphold the Constitution" rally. Thus, starting from the oral arguments of the "Sunagawa Incident" held by the Supreme Court from September 7th to 18th, a strong struggle to support the Idate Judgement and uphold the Constitution has been combined with the struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and has been expanding among people of all classes in Japan. People in various places are enthusiastically carrying out a signature campaign to support the "Idate Judgement," and the voices in the public opinion circles demanding that the Supreme Court make a fair judgement supporting the "Idate Judgement" are also constantly rising.
　　In July of the year before last, the people of Sunagawa Town in Tokyo waged a heroic struggle against the expansion of the Tachikawa base by the U.S. military. At that time, some workers and students who supported the struggle of the people of Sunagawa Town rushed into the base to prevent the compulsory measurement by the Tokyo Procurement Bureau. The reactionary Japanese prosecution authorities filed a public prosecution against seven patriotic workers and students, saying that they had violated Article 2 of the "Special Criminal Law" (formulated based on Article 3 of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"), demanding that they be sentenced to six months in prison. This traitorous act by the Japanese reactionaries aroused great indignation among the Japanese people.
　　Under the firm struggle and strong demands of the Japanese people, on March 30th this year, Idate Akio, the presiding judge of the Tokyo District Court, declared all seven defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident" not guilty. The reasons for this judgment are: ① The stationing of U.S. troops in Japan violates Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which prohibits the possession of war potential, and "is not permitted by the Constitution"; ② Since the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan violates the Constitution, then the "Special Criminal Law" which protects the interests of the U.S. military stationed in Japan also violates Article 31 of the Japanese Constitution and is therefore invalid. Article 31 of the Japanese Constitution stipulates: "No person shall be deprived of life or liberty, nor shall any other criminal penalty be imposed, except according to procedure established by law."
　　Article 9 of the post-war Japanese Constitution clearly stipulates: "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."
　　However, successive Japanese governments have been violating the provisions of Article 9 of the Constitution, engaging in rearmament and reviving militarist activities. In particular, the Kishi Nobusuke government, trampling on the Constitution, carrying out nuclear armament and reviving militarist activities, is more rampant than any previous government.
　　The "Idate Judgement" interprets Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution by implementing the peaceful principles of the Constitution. At the same time, the judgement's interpretation of Article 31 of the Constitution protects the human rights of the defendants and defends the principle of the Constitution protecting basic human rights.
　　The broad masses of Japanese people who yearn for peace and independence warmly welcome the judgement of Judge Idate. This fair judgement of the Tokyo District Court, based on the peaceful principles of the Constitution, gives a powerful blow to the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of rearmament. Moreover, based on the further extension of the "Idate Judgement," it can be clearly seen that the basis for the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan, namely the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," violates the Constitution. This strikes at the Kishi Nobusuke government's current conspiracy with the United States to revise the "Security Treaty." Precisely because of this, the Kishi Nobusuke clique, eager to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," believes that if the original judgement of the Tokyo District Court is maintained, it will hinder the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Therefore, it filed an appeal to the Supreme Court through the prosecution authorities, attempting to put pressure on the Supreme Court to overturn the "Idate Judgement."
　　Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court held six oral arguments on the "Sunagawa Incident" appeal from September 7th to 18th. This debate has attracted the attention of domestic and foreign public opinion. On the first day of the oral arguments, Kiyohara Kuniichi, the Prosecutor General of the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, personally appeared in court and actively spoke at the beginning of the debate. This is an unprecedented move in the history of the Japanese Prosecutor's Office. On the defense side, a defense lawyer team consisting of 286 lawyers, including Chief Defense Attorney Unno Shukichi and Deputy Chief Defense Attorney Saeki Seiji, was formed, surpassing the scale of the "Matsukawa Incident" defense lawyer team. Among the defense lawyers, including Chief Defense Attorney Unno, former Supreme Court Judge Mano Takeshi, former Japan Federation of Bar Associations President Nagano Kunisuke, Osaka Bar Association President Mori Yoichi and other 26 prominent figures in the Japanese judicial community, refuted the fallacies of the prosecution authorities in their responses. Outside the courtroom, on September 14th, during the climax of the oral arguments, the people of the bases around Tokyo, such as Sunagawa, launched a parade to "Support the Idate Judgement" and marched towards Tokyo. On the night of the 18th, when the oral arguments ended, a 10,000-person rally was held at the Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall in Tokyo.
　　The prosecution authorities believe that the interpretation of the Constitution must adapt to the development of the situation, attempting to legalize the statement that "Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution does not prohibit the possession of self-defense war potential" and the established fact of rearmament. The prosecution authorities emphasized that "placing our country in a state of defenselessness cannot prevent the scourge of war caused by external aggression. Based on this understanding, whether to allow foreign troops to be stationed in Japan is a policy issue that can only be entrusted to the Cabinet and the Diet, and has nothing to do with Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution." As for Prosecutor Imoto Daiichi, he even put forward the "firmly guarding the gateway theory," saying that "'firmly guarding the gateway theory' is always correct." This so-called "firmly guarding the gateway theory" starts from the international view of Dulles and his ilk, clamoring that in order to prevent communist "aggression," it is necessary to rearm and "firmly guard the gateway." The fallacy held by the prosecution authorities not only wants to legalize the established fact of rearmament in the interpretation of the Constitution, but also aims to legalize the Kishi Nobusuke government's ongoing activities to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
　　In response to the various fallacies of the prosecution authorities, the defense side pointed out that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" which allows U.S. troops to be stationed in Japan violates the Constitution; the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" which regards China and the Soviet Union as imaginary enemies is an aggressive military alliance. Defense lawyers Naito Isao and Ashida Koji cited the historical facts of the Korean War and the Indochina War to illustrate that the U.S. military has consistently attempted to invade China. Naito Isao specifically pointed out: "After sending troops to Korea, Indochina, and interfering in the civil wars of Asian countries, the United States sent the Seventh Fleet to the vicinity of Kinmen and Matsu in China last summer, and carried out illegal armed intervention in China's civil war."
　　In this way, the defense side thoroughly exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, and clearly declared to the Japanese people through the court that the purpose of the Kishi Nobusuke clique's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to strengthen the aggressive military alliance aimed at China and the Soviet Union.
　　After the oral arguments, the Supreme Court is currently deliberating, preparing to make a final judgement on the "Sunagawa Incident" in mid-December this year. Among the fifteen judges of the Supreme Court, there are reactionary judges like Judge Tanaka Kotaro. Tanaka Kotaro, based on the international view of Dulles and his ilk, viciously slanders China and the Soviet Union. These reactionary judges of the Supreme Court are in cahoots with the Kishi Nobusuke government. During this oral argument, they tried their best to limit the number of defense lawyers and the number of oral arguments, and put pressure on the defense lawyers in various ways. Therefore, the defense lawyers had to vigorously fight against this conspiracy of the Supreme Court.
　　In view of this situation, the Japanese people have decided to step up the struggle to "Support the Idate Judgement, Uphold the Constitution." This struggle, combined with the struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," will have even greater progress in the future. On the last day of the oral arguments, defense lawyer Nagano Kunisuke recounted in court that when he visited China as the head of the International Association of Jurists delegation in August this year, the Chinese people cared about the trial of the "Sunagawa Incident" as if it were their own business. His speech greatly moved many people. Now, not only the Japanese people, but also the Chinese people, the Soviet people, the American people, and all peace-loving people in the world are watching how the Japanese Supreme Court will finally judge the "Sunagawa Incident."

　　日本人民支持公正裁判的斗争
　　蓝海
    针对岸信介政府强行修改日美“安全条约”，加强日美军事同盟的活动，日本人民阻止修改和争取废除这一条约的斗争一天比一天高涨。日本各界人民准备在召开国会临时会议前在全国各地开展阻止修改日美“安全条约”第七次全国统一行动。而在第七次统一行动之前，从10月10日起，日本全国又展开了一个支持“伊达判决、拥护宪法月”的运动。“伊达判决”，就是东京地方裁判所裁判长伊达秋雄对“砂川事件”作出的“美军驻在日本为日本宪法所不能容许”的判决。今年10月13日东京的砂川町将举行“支持伊达判决、拥护宪法”大会。这样，从9月7日至18日最高裁判所举行的“砂川事件”口头辩论开始，一个强有力的支持伊达判决、拥护宪法的斗争，已经同阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”斗争结合起来，在日本各阶层人民中间扩展开来。各地人民正在踊跃地开展支持“伊达判决”的签名运动，舆论界要求最高裁判所作出支持“伊达判决”的公正判决的呼声也不断地高涨。
    前年7月间东京的砂川町人民为反对美军扩大立川基地而进行了英勇的斗争。当时支持砂川町人民斗争的一些工人、学生为了阻止东京调达局的强制测量，冲进了基地。反动的日本检察当局对七名爱国工人、学生提起公诉，说他们违犯了“刑事特别法”（根据日美“安全条约”第三条制定的）第二条，要求判处他们六个月徒刑。日本反动当局的这一卖国行为引起了日本人民极大的愤慨。
    在日本人民坚决斗争和强烈要求下，今年3月30日东京地方裁判所裁判长伊达秋雄对“砂川事件”的七名被告宣判全部无罪。这一判决的理由是：①美军驻在日本，是违反禁止保有作战力量的日本宪法第九条，“为宪法所不容许的”；②既然美军驻在日本违反宪法，那末维护驻日美军利益的“特别刑事法”也是违反日本宪法第三十一条，因而是无效的。日本宪法第三十一条规定：“任何人非依法律所定手续，不得剥夺其生命或自由，或科以其他刑罚。”
    战后日本宪法第九条明确地规定：“日本国民真诚希望以正义与秩序为基础之国际和平。所谓国权发动之战争与武力之威吓及行使，永久予以放弃，不作为解决国际纷争之手段。为达到前项目的计，不保持陆海空及其他战力，不承认国家之交战权。”
    但是，日本历届政府都一直在违反宪法第九条的规定，从事重整军备和复活军国主义的活动，特别是岸信介政府，蹂躏宪法，进行核武装和复活军国主义的活动，比过去任何一届政府都嚣张。
    “伊达判决”对于日本宪法第九条的解释贯彻了宪法的和平原则。同时，判决对宪法第三十一条的解释，是维护被告的人权，捍卫宪法保护基本人权的原则。
    渴望和平、独立的广大日本人民，热烈欢迎伊达裁判长的判决。东京地方裁判所的这一公正判决，根据宪法的和平原则，给岸信介政府重整军备的政策以有力的打击。而且，根据“伊达判决”进一步引伸，就可以明显地看出美军驻在日本的依据即日美“安全条约”是违反宪法的。这就打击了岸信介政府现在同美国进行修改“安全条约”的阴谋。正因为这样，急于修改日美“安全条约”的岸信介集团，认为如维持东京地方裁判所的原判，就会妨碍修改日美“安全条约”的活动。于是通过检察当局越级向最高裁判所起诉，企图对最高裁判所施加压力，来推翻“伊达判决”。
    在这种情况下，最高裁判所从9月7日至18日前后六次举行了“砂川事件”上诉口头辩论。这一辩论引起了国内外舆论的重视。在口头辩论的第一天，最高检察厅检事总长清原邦一，亲自出庭在开始辩论时积极发言。这是日本检察厅历史上空前的举动。在辩护人方面，主任辩护律师海野晋吉、副主任辩护律师佐伯静治等二百八十六位律师组成了辩护律师团，其规模超过了“松川事件”的辩护律师团。在辩护人当中，包括海野主任辩护律师、前任最高裁判所审判官真野毅、前日本律师会会长长野国助、大阪律师会会长毛利与一等日本司法界二十六位著名人士，在答辩中反驳了检察当局的谬论。在法庭外面，9月14日在口头辩论高潮中，东京周围的砂川等基地人民发起了“支持伊达判决”的游行，向东京市内进发。在口头辩论结束的18日夜东京日比谷露天音乐厅又举行了万人的大集会。
    检察当局认为对宪法的解释必须适应形势的发展，企图使“日本宪法第九条并不禁止保有自卫战力”的说法和重整军备既成事实合法化。检察当局强调说“置我国于无防卫的状态并不能预防因外部侵略而引起的战祸。基于这种认识，是否容许外国军队驻扎日本，是一个只能委之于内阁及国会的政策问题，而同日本宪法第九条无关。”至于像井本台吉检事，竟然提出了“牢守门户论”，说什么“‘牢守门户论’始终是正确的”。这种所谓“牢守门户论”是从杜勒斯之流的国际观出发，扬言为了防止共产主义的“侵略”必须重整军备“牢守门户”。检察当局所持的这种谬论，不仅要使重整军备的既成事实在宪法的解释上合法化，而且目的在于使岸信介政府正在进行的修改日美“安全条约”的活动合法化。
    针对检察当局的种种谬论，辩护人方面指出允许美军驻在日本的日美“安全条约”是违反宪法的；以中国、苏联为假想敌国的日美“安全条约”是侵略的军事同盟。辩护人内藤功和芦田浩治，举出朝鲜战争和印度支那战争等的历史事实说明了美军一贯地企图侵略中国。内藤功特别指出：“美国继出兵朝鲜、印度支那和干预亚洲国家内战后，于去年夏天又派遣第七舰队到中国的金门、马祖附近，对中国的内战实行了非法的武力干涉。”
    这样，辩护人方面彻底地揭穿了美帝国主义的侵略性，并通过法庭明确地向日本人民宣告：岸信介集团修改日美“安全条约”的目的就是要加强以中国、苏联为目标的侵略的军事同盟。
    经过口头辩论后，目前最高裁判所正在进行商讨，准备在今年12月中旬作出对“砂川事件”的最后判决。在最高裁判所的十五个审判官当中，有像裁判长田中耕太郎那样的反动法官。田中耕太郎根据杜勒斯之流的国际观，十分恶毒地污蔑中国、苏联。最高裁判所的这些反动的审判官是同岸信介政府一个鼻孔出气的。在这次口头辩论时，他们曾极力限制辩护人的人数，并且限制口头辩论的次数，对辩护人多方施加压力。因此，辩护人曾不得不大力对最高裁判所的这种阴谋策动进行了斗争。
    鉴于这种情况，日本人民决定加紧开展“支持伊达判决、拥护宪法”的斗争。这一斗争同阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争结合起来，今后还会有更大的进展。在口头辩论最后的一天，辩护人长野国助在法庭上叙述了他在今年8月作为国际法学家协会访华团团长访问中国时，中国人民像关心自己的事情一样关心“砂川事件”的裁判。他的发言使许多人大为感动。现在，不仅日本人民，而且中国人民、苏联人民、美国人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民都在注视着日本最高裁判所如何最后判决“砂川事件”。（10月10日寄自东京）（附图片）
