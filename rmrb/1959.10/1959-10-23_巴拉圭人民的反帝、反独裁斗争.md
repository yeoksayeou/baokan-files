    The Paraguayan People's Anti-Imperialist, Anti-Dictatorial Struggle

    Editor's Note: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published an article by Tani Sosa from Asunción on August 30th, entitled "The Paraguayan People are Mobilizing Against Stroessner and US Imperialism, for Freedom and Democracy." Excerpts are as follows:

    Paraguay is a rich country, but the vast majority of its people live in poverty. This is because the land is controlled by a small number of large landowners. Another factor in Paraguay's crisis is its growing semi-colonial dependency. Its main resources have been transferred to US and British companies and monopolies.

    In order to protect the privileged interests of large landowners and foreign monopoly capital, a military and police dictatorship was established in Paraguay twenty years ago. This regime is now headed by Stroessner and includes a group of pro-American conservative leaders from the "National Republican Association." The US government has granted the dictatorial regime a large number of loans, with the aim of promoting its own plans, especially strategic ones. Paraguay's foreign debt has increased from 47 million guaraníes in 1946 to 3,584.4 million guaraníes in 1958, and 13% of its foreign exchange earnings must be used to pay interest and debts. In order to pay for huge non-productive expenditures, the dictatorial regime has implemented a policy of unlimited banknote issuance, which has caused serious inflation, stagnating and declining production.

    For these reasons, living standards have fallen sharply. According to official figures, in 1946 the minimum wage was only enough to cover 60% of workers' living expenses, in 1957 it only covered 38% of living expenses, and the current figure is even lower. Due to currency devaluation, low prices for agricultural products, and increased taxes, farmers' actual incomes are decreasing year by year. The crisis has been exacerbated by low international market prices and a policy of prohibiting trade with socialist countries. The economic stabilization and free exchange plan imposed on Paraguay by the International Monetary Fund in 1957 (freezing wages, restricting credit, increasing taxes, and borrowing foreign debt) has done nothing but worsen the situation after the sharp currency devaluation.

    Therefore, it is not surprising that political agitation has been rising, causing a crisis that, according to well-informed political observers, could lead to events that could bring about serious and profound changes in the political, economic, and social situation.

    A general strike last August – extraordinary in its scale, courage, and tenacity – shook the entire structure of the dictatorial regime. A new fact was seen: workers belonging to the "National Republican Association" and those belonging to the opposition united into one front and launched a struggle in a common strike, which soon took on a political color. Actions of struggle appeared in the streets. Although Stroessner mobilized all of his military and police forces against the workers, he still failed to diminish the general enthusiasm of the people awakened in this largest nationwide struggle since the civil war in 1946. Shortly thereafter, there were two mass struggles with unanimous participation, opposing the government's arbitrary acts in Villarrica, Paraguay's second largest city. Then peasant struggles broke out again in Concepcion and Ankanan, which clearly showed the new wind blowing in the Guaraní land. The victory of the Cuban revolution aroused a warm political atmosphere. Stroessner could not but mobilize troops to prevent the masses from holding demonstrations celebrating the victory of the heroic Cuban people. But the example of Cuba has been deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people.

    Influenced by these facts, in February of this year, Father Ramón Talavera issued a letter to the (Paraguayan) people from Montevideo, calling for the establishment of a national liberation front "on the basis of unity and a common program that does not exclude anyone." A few days later, the "United National Liberation Front," participated in by various political groups and constitutionalist military personnel, was announced, which received a wide response throughout the country.

    Stroessner is playing the trick of promising "gradual" democratization. The US ambassador openly approves of this plan. By implementing this plan, Stroessner and Interior Minister Infrán (a heinous executioner) formally lifted the national state of siege and allowed certain public activities limited to the Liberal Party and the February Party. These two parties, as well as some compromise leaders of the "National Republican Association" who are dependent on American interests, enthusiastically accepted this plan and tried to drag their parties down this road. However, the facts are too obvious: no amnesty has been announced; Law 294 ("Defense of Democracy Law") is still maintained; political and trade union prisoners are still locked in jail; police announcements strictly prohibit political activities; those disobedient opposition leaders are accused, and so on. The people know that this plan is used to hinder them. At the May 1st rally, the working class had already rejected this plan, demanding immediate and complete liberation and the establishment of a new government as a guarantee for the people. The Communist Party, which is in a state of absolute illegality, played a prominent role, powerfully exposing the "gradual democracy" plan and calling on all parties to "fight together for complete liberation, for the establishment of a democratic provisional government."

    The police attack on students and people during a peaceful demonstration against the increase in bus fares sparked strong protests and street fighting against the police. Part of the "National Republican Association" – which holds a majority in the House of Representatives – condemned the police's brutality. Stroessner announced a national state of siege, dissolved the House of Representatives, and launched a campaign of terror. Hundreds of "National Republican Association" leaders were jailed, imprisoned, exiled, or sent to concentration camps.

    Currently, very serious events for the country are appearing in Asunción. Public opinion holds an absolute contempt for the new farce of the parliamentary "elections" scheduled for February 1960. There is a boiling mood and a greater determination to struggle among the people. People no longer believe in compromising solutions. People demand thorough change. Destroy the entire dictatorial system, together with its foundation.

### 巴拉圭人民的反帝、反独裁斗争

    巴拉圭人民的反帝、反独裁斗争
    编者按　古巴“今日报”8月30日发表了塔尼·索萨自亚松森写的一篇文章，题目是“巴拉圭人民动员起来，反对斯特罗斯纳和美帝国主义，争取自由民主”。摘要如下：
    巴拉圭是一个富饶的国家，但广大人民却过着少吃无喝的生活。这是因为土地被一小撮大庄园主所掌握。巴拉圭危机的另一因素是它的不断增长的半殖民地型的附庸性。它的主要富源都已转到美、英公司和垄断企业的手里。
    为了保护大庄园主和外国垄断资本的特权利益，二十年前在巴拉圭建立了军警独裁的政权，这个政权现在是以斯特罗斯纳为首，并且搜罗了一群“国家共和党”的亲美保守领袖。美国政府已经给予独裁政权大量贷款，目的在于推行它自己的计划，特别是有战略性的计划。巴拉圭的外债已从1946年的四千七百万瓜拉尼增加到1958年的三十五亿八千四百万瓜拉尼，它的外汇收入有13％必须用来偿付利息和债务。为了支付庞大的非生产开支，独裁政权执行了无限制发行钞票的政策，这种使生产停滞和衰退的政策，已经引起了严重的通货膨胀。
    因为上述原因，生活水平急剧下降。根据官方材料，1946年最低工资只够开销工人生活费用的60％，在1957年只敷生活费的38％，而目前比数还要少得多。由于货币贬值、农产品价格低落和赋税增加，农民们的实际收入一年比一年减少。国际市场价格的低落和禁止同社会主义国家贸易的政策使危机更加严重。国际货币基金组织在1957年强加于巴拉圭的稳定经济和自由兑换计划（冻结工资、限制信贷、增加税收，以及借外债），在货币急剧贬值以后除了使这一切恶化以外没有起到别的作用。
    正因为此，无怪乎政治上的激动状态一直在上升，引起一种危机——据消息灵通的政治观察家认为，这种危机可能导致足以使政治、经济和社会局面发生严重和深刻变革的事件。
    去年8月发生的一次总罢工——就其规模、勇猛和坚韧性来说，都是异乎寻常的——动摇了独裁政权的整个结构。人们看到一种新的事实：属于“国家共和党”和属于反对派的工人们联合成一个阵线，在共同的罢工中展开斗争，这次罢工很快就具备着政治色彩。斗争行动在大街上出现。尽管斯特罗斯纳发动了他的全部军警部队来反对工人，但是他仍然未能使人民在这次自从1946年内战以来最大的全国性斗争中觉醒起来的普遍热情有丝毫减退。不久以后，产生了两次全民一致参加的大斗争，反对政府在巴拉圭第二大城维拉里卡的任意横行。接着在公塞普森和安卡南新爆发了农民斗争，这些斗争清楚地表明在瓜拉尼土地上吹动的新的风向。古巴革命的胜利唤起了热烈的政治气氛。斯特罗斯纳不能不调动军队来阻止群众举行庆祝英雄的古巴人民的胜利的示威。但是古巴的榜样已深深印入人民的心里。
    在这些事实的影响下，今年2月拉蒙·塔拉维拉神父从蒙得维的亚发出告（巴拉圭）人民书，号召“在不排斥任何人的团结和共同纲领的基础上”建立全国解放阵线。不多几天以后，由各政治团体和宪政派军人参加的“全国解放联合阵线”宣告成立，这件事得到全国广泛的响应。
    斯特罗斯纳玩弄允诺“逐步”民主化的花招。美国大使公开赞许这一计划。由于实行这一计划，斯特罗斯纳和内政部长英斯弗兰（罪大恶极的刽子手）形式上解除了全国戒严状态，允许限于自由党和二月党的某些公开活动。这两个党以及“国家共和党”的某些依附于美国利益的妥协派领袖人，热烈地接受这一计划，并努力把他们的党拖向这条道路。但是，事实是太明显了：没有宣布大赦；第294号法律（“保卫民主法”）仍然维持着；政治犯和工会犯仍然关在监牢里；警察布告上面宣布严格禁止政治活动；那些不顺从的反对党领袖被控诉，等等。人民知道，这项计划是用来阻碍他们的。在5月1日的集会上，工人阶级就已经拒绝了这项计划，他们要求立即和彻底的解放，并要求成立作为人民保障的新政府。处于绝对非法状态的共产党起了突出的作用，它有力地揭露“逐步民主”计划，号召各派人士“为彻底的解放，为成立一个民主化的临时政府”而共同斗争。
    警察袭击学生和人民为反对提高汽车票价而举行的和平示威的事件激起了强大的抗议和反对警察的街上斗争。“国家共和党”的一部分人——在众议院中占大多数——斥责警察横行。斯特罗斯纳宣布全国戒严，解散众议院，并展开恐怖活动。成百“国家共和党”领导人被关进牢里，被监禁、放逐或送入集中营。
    目前，在亚松森这个地方出现了对国家说来是非常严重的事件。舆论界对预定在1960年2月举行的议会“选举”这一新的滑稽剧持绝对轻蔑的态度。在人民中间有沸腾的情绪和更大的斗争决心。人们已经不相信折衷的解决办法。人们要求彻底的变革。把整个独裁制度，连同它的基础一起摧毁。
