Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: One hundred and eight youth tunneling and coal mining teams from the Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan coal mines in Heilongjiang Province, on October 1st, proposed to fraternal youth tunneling and coal mining teams across the country to launch a "more cycles, more overproduction" friendship competition.

The proposal stated that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward extremely glorious and grand tasks to the people of the whole country, namely: to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year, and to strive to catch up with the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years. They were greatly encouraged after studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They understand the significant responsibility that coal workers shoulder in realizing this great task. In order to join hands with coal mine workers across the country, fight hard in the fourth quarter, and make outstanding achievements in the large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition and the over-fulfillment of this year's coal production target of 335 million tons, they proposed to launch a friendship competition with the goal of "more cycles, more overproduction, monthly leaps forward, and daily safety" among youth tunneling and coal mining teams in national coal enterprises.

Their guarantee conditions are: First, to over-fulfill the coal production plan by more than 16.5% in the next few months. The monthly output per unit working face exceeds the coal industry's large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition standard. To over-fulfill the tunneling plan by 35%. Second, vigorously conserve and cherish tools, and promote group economic accounting. On the premise of ensuring quality and safety, reuse of pit props should be increased from 50% to 70%; and efforts should be made to save gunpowder. Third, strengthen electromechanical maintenance to ensure safe operation and give full play to mechanical efficiency.

The proposal stated that in order to achieve the above conditions, they must: First, give prominence to politics, conscientiously study the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, further boost their energy, overcome all difficulties, strengthen unity, promote the spirit of collaboration, and fully and thoroughly achieve various competition conditions. Second, actively study and promote various advanced experiences, and carry out socialist labor emulation. In coal mining, creatively promote advanced experiences such as rapid movement of chutes, blasting and coal loading, and multiple cycles according to different situations; in tunneling, promote advanced experiences such as four-shift cross-operation, deep-hole blasting, and continuous slotting to achieve high yield, high quality, and high efficiency. Third, vigorously carry out technical learning. Adopt various forms, such as one teacher with multiple apprentices, technical research associations, large classes, and demonstration performances, to improve technology, especially to help new workers improve their technical level. Fourth, conscientiously implement various rules and regulations, implement the policy of "safety for production, production must be safe," eliminate major casualties, strive to eliminate minor injuries, and reduce minor injuries.

Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: The Ministry of Coal Industry, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a joint notice on the 4th, warmly supporting the initiative of 108 youth tunneling and coal mining teams from mining areas such as Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan in Heilongjiang Province to launch a "more cycles, more overproduction" friendship competition, hoping that all youth tunneling and coal mining teams across the country can actively participate in this competition.

The notice stated that since the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the soaring enthusiasm of coal industry workers has been stimulated. They are high-spirited, energetic, and with an overwhelming force, they are overcoming various difficulties in their progress, and with the heroic spirit of communism, they have launched a coal seizing battle. Coal production has been rising steadily, and good news of production has been frequently reported. The initiative of 108 youth tunneling and coal mining teams in Heilongjiang Province further demonstrates the fighting will and unparalleled determination of Chinese coal miners.

The notice stated that the Ministry of Coal Industry, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hope that all enterprises, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations in all provinces and cities will enthusiastically support their initiative, publicize their labor spirit, and widely and deeply organize tunneling teams (groups) and coal mining teams (groups) in their regions and units to participate in the competition, strengthen specific leadership, regularly inspect, evaluate, and summarize and exchange experiences at any time, in order to continuously improve the level of coal production and strive to complete and over-fulfill this year's coal tasks.
