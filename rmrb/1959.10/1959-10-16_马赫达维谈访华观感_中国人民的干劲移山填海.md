Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, October 14th: Colonel Mahdawi, President of the Iraqi Supreme Special Military Tribunal, told Baghdad Radio reporters about his recent impressions of visiting China, saying, "The most important thing that caught my attention in this emerging modern country is that the sons of this country are eagerly, actively, firmly, powerfully, and with strong determination, dedicated to their work. The Arabic idiom says, 'Determination can move mountains,' but they add: 'and can fill seas.'"

Mahdawi said that the Chinese people, in order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of their People's Republic, built several large buildings in ten months. In fact, if you see these buildings, you would not imagine that these buildings could be completed in less than ten years. He also said that, in fact, buildings like the Great Hall of the People and the Agricultural Exhibition Hall "prove the vitality of the Chinese people. This vitality was liberated after China was liberated from imperialism and reactionaries. Once liberated, this vitality became a great force for construction in all aspects of life."

Mahdawi praised the People's Communes. He said that the People's Communes "enable agriculture to achieve very good harvests, and they justly and equally guarantee the rights of male and female farmers. They also ensure that these farmers receive education. Schools, cultural institutions, and health institutions have been established in these People's Communes."

　　马赫达维谈访华观感
    中国人民的干劲移山填海
    据新华社巴格达14日电　伊拉克最高特别军事法庭庭长马赫达维上校向巴格达电台记者谈到他最近访问中国的印象时说，“这个新兴的现代国家引起我注意的最重要的事情是，这个国家的儿子热切地、积极地、坚定地、有力地和以坚强的决心献身于他们的工作。阿拉伯成语说，‘决心可以移山’，但是他们还加上一句：‘可以填海’。”
    马赫达维说，中国人民为了庆祝他们的人民共和国成立十周年，在十个月内建成了好几座大厦。事实上，如果你们看到这些大厦，你们不会设想这些建筑物能够不用十年的时间就可以建成。他还说，事实上，像人民大会堂、农业展览馆等建筑物“证明了中国人民的活力。这种活力是中国从帝国主义和反动派下面获得解放以后解放出来的。这种活力一经解放，就变成在生活各方面进行建设的伟大力量”。
    马赫达维赞扬人民公社。他说，人民公社“使农业获得非常好的收成，它公正、平等地保证男女农民的权利。它还保证这些农民受到教育。这些人民公社中已成立了学校、文化机构和卫生机构”。
