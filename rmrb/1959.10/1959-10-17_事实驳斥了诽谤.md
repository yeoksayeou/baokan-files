　　Facts Refute Slander
　　By Our Correspondent, Yu Feng
    Right-leaning opportunists attack us, saying, "Last year's massive steel production drive, without any experimentation, was a sudden boom, resulting in more losses than gains." The existence and development of the Iron and Steel Plant of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee – the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's steel experiment field – powerfully refutes this fallacy.
    In June of last year, in order to promote large-scale steel production in the province, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee decided to establish an iron and steel plant run by the Provincial Party Committee organs, to gain experience and set an example of combining politics and technology in the leadership of the iron and steel industry. In August of last year, only one small 13-cubic-meter blast furnace in the plant was put into production. By September of this year, the plant had expanded to fifty small blast furnaces ranging from eight to twenty-eight cubic meters, a three-ton converter steelmaking workshop, a small converter workshop, and a small 250mm steel rolling workshop. In just over a year, it has become a small iron and steel complex with an annual output of 120,000 tons of pig iron, 100,000 tons of steel, and 25,000 tons of steel products. Since the preparations for construction began more than a year ago, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has been conducting various experimental works here. The experience and lessons learned by this plant in construction, production, enterprise management, and ideological leadership have played a huge role in the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's leadership of the province's iron and steel industry to advance by leaps and bounds.
    In terms of iron and steel industry construction, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has firmly implemented the central government's policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small scales since the start of the large-scale steel production drive last year. In addition to stepping up the expansion of the medium-sized blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, and after the experiment of the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant, it led the province's construction of small blast furnaces. Responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee personally carried out various experiments with small indigenous furnaces and small blast furnaces here, and participated in the construction of the first 13-cubic-meter small foreign blast furnace. They worked with workers, technicians, and cadres to find ways to overcome difficulties in equipment, raw materials, and technology. The completion and commissioning of the plant's first small foreign blast furnace not only broke the superstitious view that "organs cannot run the iron and steel industry" and the mystical idea of building small foreign furnaces, but also set an example for leaders in various places with the Provincial Party Committee's down-to-earth style of personally doing things and painstakingly studying in leading iron and steel construction. The secretaries of various municipal party committees also personally set up iron and steel experimental fields to lead steel production, thereby further promoting the upsurge of large-scale steel production in the province, with organs, schools, troops, residents' committees, and people's communes all building furnaces to make iron.
    To lead large-scale steel production throughout the province, the first problem to be solved was which type of furnace was best? The Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant undertook this experimental task. In addition to building small foreign blast furnaces of 8 cubic meters and above, the plant also experimented with many furnace types from inside and outside the province. How much time it took to build various furnaces, whether the required equipment was easy to manufacture, the quality of the iron produced, how much coke was consumed, and how much labor was required were all experimented and compared here. After these experiments, the Provincial Party Committee decided to use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to build small foreign blast furnaces of 8 cubic meters and above throughout the province.
    In order to accelerate the construction speed of small foreign blast furnace groups in various places, the Provincial Party Committee summarized the construction and commissioning experience of the first blast furnace of the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant, held on-site meetings to promote it, and sent cadres to help various places build furnaces, commission them, and deal with accidents.
    Through the iron and steel experimental field and the construction of the iron and steel industry in various places, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee specifically understood the construction conditions, equipment manufacturing, and production of small foreign blast furnace groups. Based on these circumstances, the Provincial Party Committee promptly proposed that the province's large-scale steel production should adhere to the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with foreign methods as the main focus, rational layout, and equal emphasis on quality," and put forward many specific methods in terms of blast furnace layout, equipment manufacturing, and personnel training, helping various places solve difficulties in the construction of the iron and steel industry, so that the construction of the province's iron and steel industry developed rapidly. In the four months after August last year, the province built 796 small foreign blast furnaces with an annual production capacity of more than 2 million tons, and more than 610 small converters, laying the foundation for this year's production.
    This year, in order to accelerate the construction of three-ton steelmaking converters throughout the province, the Provincial Party Committee's Industrial Secretary personally led the construction of the three-ton converter workshop of the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant, adopting the method of "combining construction and contracting," with the heads of construction, installation, and the iron and steel plant organizing the command and unifying leadership over the construction of the entire project. The converter steelmaking workshop was completed in just over sixty days. After this method of rapid factory construction was promoted throughout the province, it accelerated the construction speed. Within five months, 42 three-ton converters were rebuilt and newly built throughout the province, and all have been put into production.
    In terms of steel production, the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant has played a leading role in the province's iron and steel industry in improving steel production and quality. At the beginning of this year, the plant came up with various ways to improve the quality and production of pig iron, broke through technical barriers, and made the sulfur content of pig iron less than 0.2%, initially solving the smelting technology problem of small blast furnaces producing foundry pig iron. In June, according to the requirements of the main user – Hefei Steel Plant, the plant organized a production experiment of smelting according to plan and specifications under the existing production conditions of small blast furnaces. No. 17 furnace of this plant, in the statistical analysis of 128 production tests in fourteen days, met the requirements of steelmaking pig iron 119 times, of which first-class products accounted for 66.4%. This experiment confirmed the possibility of small blast furnaces producing according to specified varieties and specifications, indicating that the smelting quality of small blast furnaces can match that of large blast furnaces, paving the way for small blast furnaces throughout the province to improve pig iron quality, and also proving that small blast furnaces have great potential under existing production conditions. Based on this situation, the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial iron smelting conference at the end of June, using the example of the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant to criticize some people's right-leaning thoughts that small blast furnaces have simple equipment, cannot improve quality, and are satisfied with the status quo, and recognized that small blast furnaces have great potential. It also adopted technical research, on-site meetings, and other methods to impart the experience of the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant and advanced small blast furnaces in various places in improving quality and production to everyone. Before July, the pass rate of pig iron quality in the province was 50% to 70%, and the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces was 0.722. After July, the production quality of pig iron gradually improved, especially after the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the workers' enthusiasm was even greater, and various economic indicators of small blast furnaces rose linearly. In September, the average utilization coefficient of more than 300 small blast furnaces opened in the province reached 1.124, the qualified rate of pig iron reached 88.76%, and the coke ratio dropped to 1.216, which fully proved that the smelting quality of small blast furnaces can match that of large blast furnaces.
    The Iron and Steel Plant of the Provincial Party Committee not only undertook various experimental tasks proposed by the Provincial Party Committee, but also played the role of the Provincial Party Committee's eyes and ears in leading the iron and steel industry. Responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee often went to the factory to understand the situation, and the person in charge of the factory also actively reported to the Provincial Party Committee as soon as problems were discovered. Because the leadership relationship was direct, problems were discovered quickly, problems were understood specifically, and handling them was also rapid. Many province-wide issues were first discovered in the Iron and Steel Plant of the Provincial Party Committee and then promptly proposed for handling, such as rectifying the labor organization and adjusting the treatment of steel workers. In particular, after the anti-Rightist struggle in the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant reversed the decline in production, the Provincial Party Committee constantly paid attention to criticizing Right-leaning slackening sentiments, and the production enthusiasm of workers and cadres always remained high, and the province's steel plan was completed every month.
    From January to September this year, the province has produced more than 1.37 million tons of iron, of which more than 60% was produced by small foreign blast furnaces, and 100,000 tons of steel. Due to the large-scale steel production drive, in just over ten months, Anhui Province has changed its backward iron and steel production and jumped to become a province with more steel production in the country. Is large-scale steel production a loss of more than gains? Is this achievement not obtained by the Party through experimentation and organized and planned leadership?

　　事实驳斥了诽谤
　　本报记者　于风
    右倾机会主义者攻击我们说：“去年大办钢铁，没有经过试验，是一下轰起来的，结果得不偿失。”中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂——安徽省委钢铁试验田的存在和它的发展，有力地驳斥了这一谬论。
    去年6月，安徽省委为了推动全省大办钢铁，决定由省委机关办一个钢铁厂，取得经验，在钢铁工业领导上树立政治与技术相结合的榜样。去年8月，这个厂只有一个十三立方米的小高炉投入生产。今年9月，这个厂已发展到八到二十八立方米的小高炉五十个，三吨转炉炼钢车间、小转炉车间和二百五十公厘的小轧钢车间各一个。在短短的一年内已建成一个年产生铁十二万吨、钢十万吨、钢材二万五千吨的小型钢铁联合企业。从筹备兴建到现在一年多来，安徽省委始终在这里进行着各种试验工作。这个厂在建设、生产、企业管理和思想领导方面所取得的经验和教训，都在安徽省委领导全省钢铁工业大踏步前进中发挥了巨大作用。
    在钢铁工业建设方面，安徽省委从去年大办钢铁开始，坚定地贯彻了中央土洋并举、大中小结合的方针。除抓紧扩建马鞍山钢铁公司的中型高炉外，并经过省委钢铁厂的试验，领导了全省建设小高炉的工作。省委负责同志亲自在这里进行各种小土炉和小高炉的试验，参加了第一个十三立方米小洋高炉的兴建工作。他们和工人、技术员、干部一起想办法，克服设备、原材料、技术等方面的困难。这个厂的第一个小洋高炉建成投入生产，不仅破除了“机关不能办钢铁工业”的迷信观点和建小洋炉的神秘思想，而且省委在领导钢铁建设中，亲自动手，刻苦钻研的踏实作风，给各地领导树立了一个榜样。各地市委书记也都亲自动手办钢铁试验田，领导钢铁生产，从而进一步推动了全省大办钢铁的高潮，全省机关、学校、部队、居民委员会、人民公社纷纷建炉炼铁。
    领导全省大办钢铁，首先要解决的问题是用什么炉子最好？省委钢铁厂承担了这个试验任务，这个厂除建八立方米以上的小洋高炉外，还试验了省内外许多炉型。建设各种炉子需要多少时间，需要的设备是否容易制造，生产出来的铁质量如何，消耗焦炭多少，需要劳力多少等，都在这里一一作了试验、比较；经过这些试验，省委决定用土洋结合的办法，在全省大建八立方米以上的小洋高炉。
    为了加快各地小洋群高炉的建设速度，省委总结了省委钢铁厂第一座高炉的建设和开炉经验，召开现场会议推广，并派出干部帮助各地建炉、开炉和处理事故。
    安徽省委通过钢铁试验田和各地钢铁工业的建设情况，具体了解了小洋群高炉的建设条件、设备制造和生产等情况。根据这些情况，省委及时提出全省大办钢铁要“土洋并举，以洋为主，合理布局，质量并重”的方针，并在高炉布局、设备制造、培训人员方面提出许多具体办法，帮助各地解决了钢铁工业建设中的困难，使全省钢铁工业建设迅速开展，去年8月以后的四个多月里，全省就建成了小洋高炉七百九十六座，年产能力为二百多万吨，小转炉六百一十多座，为今年生产打下了基础。
    今年为了加快全省三吨炼钢转炉的建设工作，省委工业书记又亲自领导了省委钢铁厂三吨转炉车间的建设工作，采取“建包合一”的办法，由建筑、安装和钢铁厂的负责人，组织指挥部，统一领导整个工程的建设，六十多天就建好了转炉炼钢车间。这种快速建厂的办法在全省推广后，加快了建设速度，五个月内，全省改建和新建了四十二个三吨转炉，已全部投入生产。
    在钢铁生产方面，省委钢铁厂在提高钢铁产量和质量上对全省钢铁工业起了带头作用。今年年初，这个厂就想出各种办法提高生铁质量和产量，突破了技术关，使生铁含硫量小于0.2％，初步解决了小高炉生产铸造生铁的冶炼技术问题。6月这个厂又根据主要用户——合肥钢厂要求，组织了小高炉在现有生产条件下按计划按规格冶炼的生产试验，这个厂的十七号炉，在十四天内一百二十八次生产化验统计，符合炼钢生铁要求的为一百一十九次，其中一级品占66.4％。这个试验证实了小高炉按指定品种和指定规格进行生产的可能性，说明小高炉的冶炼质量可以向大高炉看齐，为全省小高炉提高生铁质量开辟了道路，也证实了小高炉在现有生产条件下蕴藏很大潜力。根据这种情况，省委在6月底召开了全省炼铁会议，用省委钢铁厂的例子批判了有些人认为小高炉设备简陋，不能提高质量和满足现状等右倾思想，认定小高炉大有可为。并采用技术研究、现场会议等办法，把省委钢铁厂和各地先进小高炉提高质量、产量的经验，向大家传授。7月以前，全省生铁质量合格率为50％到70％，高炉利用系数为零点七二二，7月以后生铁的产量质量逐步提高，特别是党的八届八中全会决议公布后，工人干劲更大，小高炉的各种经济指标直线上升。9月全省开炉的三百多座小高炉，平均利用系数达到了一点一二四，生铁合格率达到88.76％，焦比降到一点二一六，完全证明小高炉的冶炼质量可以向大高炉看齐。
    省委机关钢铁厂不仅担负了省委提出的各项试验工作，还发挥了省委在领导钢铁工业中的耳目作用。省委负责同志经常到工厂去了解情况，厂的负责人一发现问题也主动向省委汇报，由于领导关系直接，发现问题快，了解问题具体，处理起来也就迅速。很多带有全省性的问题都是先在省委机关钢铁厂发现后，及时提出处理的。如整顿劳动组织，调整钢铁工人的待遇等。特别是在省委钢铁厂进行反右倾斗争扭转了生产下降的局面后，省委经常不断地注意批判右倾松劲情绪，工人和干部生产情绪始终保持高涨，全省钢铁计划月月完成。
    今年1至9月，全省已生产铁一百三十七万多吨，其中有60％以上是小洋高炉生产的，钢十万吨。由于大办钢铁短短的十多个月时间，安徽省已改变了钢铁生产落后面貌，跃居为全国钢铁生产较多的省份。大办钢铁难道是得不偿失吗？这个成绩难道不是党经过试验，进行有组织有计划的领导取得的吗？
