　　On the Ownership and Distribution System of People's Communes
　　Chen Zhengren
    The Nature of People's Communes

    The nature of China's rural people's communes at the present stage is socialist. The means of production are collectively owned, and the principle of distribution is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." The collective ownership of people's communes already contains some elements of ownership by the whole people, and these elements will gradually increase. People's communes currently implement a distribution system that combines wage systems and supply systems, and the supply system has the budding principle of distribution according to need. People's communes will become the best form of transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and will become the best form for our society to transition from socialism to communism. However, these do not change the socialist collective ownership nature of people's communes at the present stage.

    At the beginning of the people's commune movement, on August 29, 1958, the Central Committee of the Party, based on the proposal of Comrade Mao Zedong, passed the "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas," which clearly pointed out: "After the people's communes are built, do not rush to change collective ownership to ownership by the whole people... In fact, the collective ownership of people's communes already contains some elements of ownership by the whole people. This ownership by the whole people will continue to grow in constant development, gradually replacing collective ownership. The transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people is a process... After the transition to ownership by the whole people, like state-owned industries, its nature is still socialist, from each according to his ability, to each according to his work. Then, after many years, social products are greatly enriched, the communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities of the entire people are greatly improved, universal education is popularized and improved, the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor, which the old society left behind and which the socialist period still has to preserve, gradually disappear, and the remnants of unequal bourgeois rights reflecting these differences also gradually disappear, and the function of the state is only to deal with aggression by external enemies and no longer plays a role internally. At that time, our society will enter the communist era of from each according to his ability, to each according to his need." This passage from the resolution has clearly stated the nature of our country's society and our rural people's communes at the present stage. Subsequently, in December of the same year, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" quoted this passage and made a systematic and detailed elaboration.

    The distribution system currently implemented by rural people's communes is formulated based on this objective Marxist-Leninist analysis of the nature of people's communes at the present stage. In the first few months of the people's commune movement, due to lack of experience and because a small number of cadres did not understand the nature of people's communes at the present stage, there were some tendencies toward excessive centralization and some tendencies toward egalitarianism in the management and distribution of people's communes. The Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly criticized these tendencies and helped various regions actively and systematically overcome them ideologically and practically in the work of consolidating the people's communes over the past six months.

    The Ownership of People's Communes

    To analyze the distribution system of people's communes, we must first start with the ownership of the means of production of people's communes. Because the distribution system is determined by the ownership of the means of production. Whoever owns the means of production controls the products: feudal land ownership means that agricultural products are controlled by landlords; capitalist private ownership means that products are controlled by capitalists; the individual ownership of laborers means that products are controlled by individual laborers; socialist collective ownership means that the members of this collective jointly control the products according to the state plan; ownership by the whole people means that the products are controlled by the state representing the entire people.

    The means of production of people's communes, such as land, draught animals, farm tools, and sideline tools, are currently still socialist collective ownership, not socialist ownership by the whole people, let alone communist ownership by the whole people. People's communes currently implement the "three-level ownership system" and "graded management, graded accounting," "the ownership at the production team level is basic, the ownership at the commune level is partial, and the production brigade should also have a small part of the ownership." This is the ownership system currently implemented by people's communes.

    Why should people's communes currently implement a three-level ownership system? And why is the ownership at the production team level basic? The main reason is that the current economic conditions between production teams are not entirely the same, and the level of production development and income levels are high and low, and the public economy directly operated by the commune for the whole commune is not developed enough; under such conditions, if the basic ownership is at the commune level, with unified accounting and unified distribution for the entire commune, it will be detrimental to the unity and development of production within the commune. Therefore, it is stipulated that there should be a three-level ownership system, with the ownership at the production team level being basic, and graded management and graded accounting should be implemented. The means of production such as land, draught animals, farm tools, and sideline tools are basically owned by the production team, and the production team is the basic accounting unit. The products of the collective labor of all members of the production team, in addition to paying state taxes and allocating a small part as the commune's accumulation fund, are uniformly distributed within the entire production team. People's communes are developed on the basis of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and the production teams of people's communes are roughly equivalent to the original advanced cooperatives. The ownership of the means of production basically belongs to the production team, which is basically the small collective roughly equivalent to the original advanced cooperative, and the products are basically uniformly distributed by this collective.

    Some people say that "people's communes are no different from the original advanced agricultural cooperatives," and that "people's communes exist in name only and have actually returned to the original advanced cooperatives." This statement is completely contrary to the facts. Because the commune level still possesses partial but significant ownership. In addition to the public economy run by the commune, the commune can also extract appropriate public accumulation from each production team year by year. This is an important foundation for the great future of the commune. People's communes are a combination of government and commune, and the partial ownership at the commune level also contains elements of ownership by the whole people. Starting in 1959, the state plans to invest one billion yuan annually to help communes, especially to help those production teams with relatively poor economic conditions and low production income. The use of this state investment is mainly for capital construction to expand reproduction, which carries the elements of ownership by the whole people, and it will increase year by year. Due to the characteristics of people's communes such as being large in scale, highly public, and a combination of government and commune, people's communes have greater superiority than advanced cooperatives: "Large organizational scale, wide scope of activities, can uniformly plan the production and distribution of the entire commune, can more effectively and fully mobilize and rationally arrange rural labor forces than agricultural production cooperatives, can undertake constructions that agricultural production cooperatives find difficult to undertake, facilitate the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, as well as industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, facilitate the realization of agricultural mechanization, facilitate the stable growth of farmers' income and accelerate the progress of the entire rural life, facilitate the development of collective undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries, and can have certain supply system elements in distribution, etc." (See the "Resolution on Launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement" of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party). Therefore, people's communes are definitely a further improvement and major development of advanced agricultural production cooperatives.

    The production brigade under the production team is the contract production unit. In order to clarify the responsibility of the production brigade and improve its enthusiasm, it is also allowed to have a small part of the ownership. The production brigade contracts production, work, and cost to the production team. The contracted production part is all turned over to the production team for unified distribution. A certain proportion of the excess production is turned over to the production team, and the rest belongs to the brigade. All the saved production costs are controlled by the brigade. Under the conditions of ensuring the completion of the agricultural and sideline production tasks arranged by the production team and obeying the state market management, the production brigade can operate small-scale sideline production that is not convenient for the production team to operate; under the premise of not affecting the contracted production tasks, the production brigade should also try to make full use of the scattered land within its jurisdiction. The income from these operations is all controlled by the production brigade. All this is the concrete manifestation of the small part of the ownership of the production brigade.

    In addition, within the people's commune, under the premise of consolidating the collective ownership of all levels of the commune, the remnants of the individual ownership of the members are also retained. The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: People's communes "should announce to the masses: the means of livelihood owned by the members (including houses, clothing, furniture, etc.) and deposits in banks and credit cooperatives still belong to the members after the communization, and will always belong to the members." "Members can retain scattered trees, small farm tools, small tools, small livestock, and poultry next to their houses; they can also continue to operate some small household sideline occupations without hindering participation in collective labor." The Central Committee of the Party also instructed: "To encourage members to privately raise pigs, chickens, geese, and ducks, members should be given a certain amount of private plots." And "encourage members to make full use of the scattered and idle land next to houses, villages, water, and roads by using their scattered free time. The crops grown on these lands are... entirely at the disposal of the members." This is "small private ownership" and "small freedom" in the big collective. When the people's commune cannot fully take care of and meet the different needs of members' lives in all aspects, allowing a certain range of "small private ownership" and "small freedom" under the conditions of not affecting collective labor and being conducive to the development of the public economy is a supplement to the collective economy, which is also conducive to the consolidation of the people's commune. However, it is, after all, a transitional step, and its role is only to supplement the collective economy. The tendency to exaggerate its role, be enthusiastic about "small private ownership" and "small freedom," and hinder the development of the collective economy must be prevented.

    This is the specific situation of our country's people's communes in terms of the ownership of the means of production. In a word, people's communes now implement socialist collective ownership. "The ownership at the production team level is basic," reflecting that people's communes are developed on the basis of advanced agricultural cooperatives. The partial ownership at the commune level contains some elements of ownership by the whole people, representing the great future of people's communes.

    Graded Accounting and Distribution of People's Communes

    Because the means of production of people's communes are collectively owned, and the ownership at the production team level is basic, the people's commune takes the production team as the basic accounting unit. The products of the collective labor of each production team basically belong to the members of each production team and are jointly distributed. The specific method of distribution is: the products of the collective labor of each comprehensive and specialized production brigade under the jurisdiction of the production team are turned over to the production team according to the quantity specified in the contracted production task (in some units, the production team can extract a percentage from the excess production; in some units, the production team must bear part of the loss due to natural disasters, etc.). The production team deducts the production costs from these revenues according to the amount of contracted costs jointly agreed with the production brigade (the "production costs" mentioned here only refer to the consumption of the means of production, the same below), pays grain and other taxes to the state in accordance with state laws and regulations, and deducts public accumulation funds and public welfare funds in accordance with the regulations of the commune. The remaining part is taken as the labor remuneration of the members in the form of a combination of wage system and supply system. The wage part is distributed to the production brigade according to the number of labor days of contracted work jointly agreed upon, and then distributed to the members by the production brigade according to the number of labor days actually done by each member. The supply part is distributed according to the population of the entire production team.

    As mentioned earlier, the production brigade, as a contract production unit, also has a small part of the production income that belongs to it and does not belong to the production team. This part of the income of the production brigade can be discussed by all members of the brigade, and a small part can be extracted as the public accumulation of the brigade and to subsidize the public canteen of the brigade and other public welfare undertakings. The remaining large part, together with the wages received from the production team, is distributed according to the number of labor days done by each member of the brigade.

    The commune level, in addition to the public economy directly operated by itself being accounted and distributed separately, can also extract a percentage from the public accumulation of each production team to expand the basic construction of the public economy and public welfare undertakings that serve the entire commune. When necessary, the commune can stipulate that each production team deduct public accumulation according to different proportions based on the different conditions of each production team, and can also extract a percentage from the public accumulation of each production team according to different proportions, so as to appropriately adjust the income of members between teams and the public accumulation of teams within a certain range. All this is a concrete reflection of the partial ownership of the means of production at the commune level on the issue of distribution.

    Comprehensive analysis of the results of graded accounting and distribution at all levels of the people's commune shows that the distribution of the commune's total income is: deducting production costs, paying grain and other taxes, and deducting public accumulation funds and public welfare funds. The above deductions generally account for about 40% of the commune's total income, and the remaining 60% is distributed to members for personal consumption. Production costs are used to compensate for the means of production consumed in the production process, which is absolutely necessary; otherwise, the people's commune cannot maintain reproduction. Grain and taxes are turned over to the state, and the state uses them to invest in industrial and agricultural production construction, science, culture, education, health construction, and national defense construction, etc., which are for the benefit of the entire people and for the benefit of every member of the people's commune. Public accumulation funds are used to expand the production of the people's commune, increase production-related capital construction, such as purchasing agricultural machinery, draught animals, and other tools, etc.; to increase the working capital of the people's commune and other production reserves, such as reserve seeds, etc., all of which are necessary to continuously improve the production level of the people's commune and continuously improve the lives of the commune members, which is beneficial to every member. Part of the public accumulation fund is also invested in the capital construction of collective welfare undertakings run by the commune. For example, some people's communes have newly built schools, hospitals, and residences for members, etc., which are jointly enjoyed by the members. Public welfare funds are used as the regular expenses of schools, hospitals, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and other collective welfare undertakings run by the commune, which is the collective consumption of the commune members. It can be seen that the total income of the people's commune, all the products created by the collective labor of the commune members, in addition to supplementing the consumption of the means of production, a part (under the current production level of the people's commune, it is still a relatively large part) is directly distributed to the commune members for personal consumption, and the rest is used to pay grain tax, retain public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, etc., which ultimately are used directly and indirectly for the members themselves in this or that form. This is the place where socialist distribution is fundamentally different from capitalist distribution. Under capitalist private ownership, the surplus labor of laborers creates surplus value for capitalists. Under socialist public ownership (the collective ownership of the people's commune is a form of socialist public ownership), all the products of laborers are distributed according to the interests of laborers. The income distribution of people's communes completely conforms to the basic economic principles of distribution in socialist society expounded by Marx in the Critique of the Gotha Program.

    The Distribution System of People's Communes

    The distribution system of "combining wage system and supply system" implemented by the people's commune has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of farmers across the country. Right-leaning opportunists, they attacked this distribution system, saying that it violated the socialist principle of distribution according to work. They used this as an excuse to oppose the people's commune, oppose the Great Leap Forward, and oppose the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results."

    What is the truth? As quoted at the beginning of this article, the first resolution of the Central Committee of the Party on the issue of people's communes (the resolution of August 29, 1958) pointed out that the nature of our country's people's communes at the present stage is socialist, and it implements from each according to his ability, to each according to his work. In December of the same year, the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party also pointed out: "The part distributed to members for personal consumption implements a distribution system that combines wage system and supply system, which is a creation of our country's people's communes in the socialist distribution method and is the urgent demand of the broad masses of members at present. As mentioned earlier, this distribution system has the budding of communism, but its basic nature is still socialist, from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." For the summer distribution of 1959, the Central Committee pointed out: "Appropriately limit the supply part and gradually increase the wage part. At the current production level, the supply part should generally be limited to only about 30% of the distribution part, and at most not exceed 40%. That is, the wage part should account for about 70%, and at least not less than 60%."

    The wage part is distributed according to the number of labor days done by each member in collective labor. The supply part is distributed according to the population of the members and their families. Due to the different levels of production in various places and various people's communes, the total income and the total amount distributed to members for personal consumption are different, and the proportion of the supply part in the total amount distributed to members for personal consumption is roughly the same, but the figures are high and low. Therefore, the forms taken by the supply part in various people's communes are different. Those who can implement the food supply system according to the absolute amount of the supply part implement the food supply system (including food rations and oil, salt, firewood, and vegetables); those who cannot implement the food supply system implement the food ration supply system; if the food ration supply system cannot be implemented, the half food ration supply system is implemented, and the part of the food ration that is insufficient is supplemented from the wage part obtained. There are also a small number of people's communes that have not implemented the supply system due to excessively low production levels or other reasons, and still adopt the methods of the past advanced agricultural cooperatives, only implementing the "five guarantees" for widowed, orphaned, lonely, old, weak, and disabled members, and providing subsidies to other members who are indeed in difficult living conditions.

    All commune members with labor capacity must participate in labor to the best of their ability. The socialist principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" must also be a principle commonly observed by commune members. Therefore, when implementing the distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system, the people's commune, at the same time, stipulates for each member with labor capacity, according to the different labor conditions of each person, how many labor days each person should do in a year, season, or month. If the number of labor days stipulated is not met, they cannot enjoy the treatment of the supply system. However, the commune will provide necessary assistance in life to those who do not meet the labor days due to illness or other reasons.

    Because the distribution system of partial supply system is implemented, the contradiction between the so-called "overspending households" and "empty division households" that the agricultural production cooperatives have not solved for a long time is first solved. In the countryside, there are some households with a large population but few laborers, weak laborers, or major laborers who are sick and unable to participate in labor for several months. They are not entirely "five-guarantee households," and the "five-guarantee" method of advanced cooperatives cannot adapt to solving their problems. They were often overspending in the past in agricultural cooperatives, which are the so-called "overspending households." Since there is a part of people overspending, there is another part of farmers who should be distributed cannot be fully distributed, and there are arrears, which are the so-called "empty division households." This contradiction has not been resolved for a long time during the cooperative period. In this case, if appropriate auxiliary distribution methods are not taken in addition to the principle of distribution according to work, it is indeed difficult to resolve this contradiction. With the implementation of people's communes and the implementation of the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system, this problem can be basically solved. Therefore, it is said that this distribution system is actually the most reliable social insurance and is commonly needed by the broad masses of workers.

    Obviously, rural residents can be roughly divided into three types in terms of the impact of the implementation of the partial supply system: the first type is farmers with few laborers and many dependents, including five-guarantee households, accounting for about 20% of rural households; the second type is farmers whose ratio of laborers to dependents is comparable to the average ratio of the entire commune and team, accounting for about 60% to 70% of rural households; the third type is farmers with many laborers and few dependents, accounting for about 10% to 20% of rural households. How much does the implementation of the partial supply system have on the impact of income distribution? We can calculate: for example, a production team has a total income of 10,000 yuan, and the part distributed to members for personal consumption accounts for 60%, that is, 6,000 yuan; the supply part in these 6,000 yuan accounts for 30%, that is, 1,800 yuan, and the total population of the team is 100 people, and the income from the supply part is 18 yuan per person; farmers with few laborers and many dependents (including five-guarantee households) are calculated as 20% of the population, calculated as 20 people, and they enjoy a combined supply part of 360 yuan; however, since the food supply is implemented according to the quantity fixed by the person, people with general labor force have higher quantitative standards than the average number, and the old, weak, and children are lower than the average number. Therefore, farmers with few laborers and many dependents account for a large proportion of the old, weak, and children. Therefore, the supply part they actually enjoy is not 360 yuan, and the discount is about 300 yuan, accounting for only about 3% of the total income of 10,000 yuan. The "five-guarantee households" have already implemented the five guarantees during the advanced cooperative period. After removing this part, the part increased due to the implementation of the partial supply system by the commune accounts for only about 2% of the total income. Even this 2% is not completely given to farmers with few laborers and many dependents for free, because they still have a part of the labor force or auxiliary labor force. Part of this 2% is their earned labor remuneration. Therefore, it can be affirmed that this distribution system has not changed the basic principle of distribution according to work. Five-guarantee households and farmers with few laborers and many dependents fully support this distribution system. Whether it is a distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system or is completely distributed according to labor days, the actual income of farmers whose ratio of labor force to dependents is comparable to the average ratio of the entire commune and team does not change. They generally support the implementation of such social insurance in the long run. Farmers with many laborers and few dependents, they think that they will also have children, they cannot but consider the occurrence of diseases and deaths in their families, or they see the nursing home and think of their reliance after they are old, especially after seeing the labor enthusiasm aroused among the broad masses of farmers due to the implementation of the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system, and the role it plays in the production development and income increase of the people's commune. Most of them can also accept this distribution system, and they feel that this is also a reliance for themselves in the future. Therefore, the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party said that this partial supply system is "the most important and most reliable social insurance" and is "the urgent demand of the broad masses of members."

    At the same time, because the production of the people's commune has developed more than the original advanced cooperative, and the income has increased more, the implementation of this distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system can also fully achieve what the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party requires: "do not reduce the income of households with strong labor force and few people," and can make most of them still increase their income. The actual results of the year-end distribution of 1958 and the summer pre-distribution of 1959 fully proved this point. In 1958, the income of farmers across the country averaged about 85 yuan per person, calculated according to the entire rural population, an increase of 10% compared with 1957. For example, in the summer pre-distribution of Henan Province in 1959, the part distributed to members for personal consumption was 850 million yuan, accounting for 59% of the summer income, an increase of 10.3% compared with the same period in 1958 and an increase of 25.3% compared with the same period in 1957. For example, in the Fucheng Commune in the suburbs of Haikou City, Guangdong Province, the 1.07 million yuan distributed to members for personal consumption in the summer pre-distribution of 1959 accounted for 54.6% of the summer income of 1.96 million yuan. As a result of the distribution, compared with the same period in 1958, farmers with increased income accounted for 96%, farmers with no increase or decrease accounted for 1.4%, and farmers with reduced income accounted for 2.6%. It can also be seen that due to the increase in the total income of the people's commune and the increase in the part distributed to members for personal consumption, more than 90% of the members have increased their income, and most of the farmers with more labor force and fewer people have also increased their income. The reason why the income of a very small number of farmers has decreased is mainly not due to the fact that there is a certain degree of supply system part in the distribution method. The reasons are multifaceted, which existed before the people's communes and have long existed. The only difference is that these few households have reduced income this year, and another few households will reduce income next year. In addition, due to the increase in the collective welfare and collective consumption part of the people's commune, a very small number of members with reduced income have also gained some benefits from the collective welfare and collective consumption. This is the material basis for the majority of members with more labor force and fewer people to accept the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system.

    It should be affirmed that the distribution principle of the people's commune at the present stage is in line with the principle of from each according to his ability, to each according to his work, and conforms to the socialist law of distribution according to work. Moreover, it should be seen that on the basis of distribution according to work, supplemented by a certain amount of supply system distribution method, it meets the common requirements of most workers, which also has the budding factors of going to communism distribution according to need, and therefore has its undeniable vitality.

    The Relationship between Accumulation and Consumption in the Distribution of People's Communes

    Let's take a look at the relationship between accumulation and consumption in the distribution of people's communes.

    First, the public accumulation of people's communes has increased a lot compared to the period of advanced agricultural cooperatives due to its rapid production growth. Taking Shanxi as an example, the public accumulation fund of the province's people's communes in 1958 was 162.79 million yuan (including a part of the public welfare fund that was not separated), accounting for 11.25% of the province's total income of the people's communes for the year. If the income after deducting production costs is regarded as 100, it accounts for 15.67%. The percentage increased by more than double compared with the period of advanced cooperatives in 1957 (5.41% in 1957), and the absolute number increased even more. This example in Shanxi can represent the general situation of the country. The public accumulation fund of the people's commune actually also contains a part of the depreciation of the means of production, which is not entirely accumulation. However, the accumulation of the people's commune is not only reflected in the public accumulation fund. It is also reflected in the grain tax turned over to the state, which can also be said to be the social accumulation provided by the commune (although the state fiscal expenditure does not entirely belong to the nature of accumulation). On average, grain tax accounts for about 7% of the total income of the commune. If the income after deducting production costs is regarded as 100, it accounts for about 10% (11.22% in Shanxi in 1958). The accumulation of the commune is also reflected in a part of the voluntary labor contributed by the members to the water conservancy and other farmland capital construction run by the commune. Adding these several forms of accumulation together, the proportion of accumulation of the people's commune in the actual income of the commune after deducting production costs is about 30%. The reason why the people's commune can accumulate at such a high speed is that the organization scale of the commune is large, the scope of operation is wide, the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery and commune-run industries, and the income of the commune has increased greatly and rapidly; at the same time, there is no capital exploitation and land rent exploitation in the people's commune at all, so public accumulation can be increased faster on the basis of the conscious willingness of the broad masses of members. This is only the situation in the first year after the realization of people's communes. In the future, with the development of commune production, the improvement of management, and the further implementation of the principle of running the commune with diligence and thrift, the accumulation of the commune will definitely be further expanded. This fully proves the law of high-speed development and high-speed accumulation of the socialist economy.

    Second, the relationship between accumulation and consumption in the income distribution of the people's commune is the relationship between the current interests, personal interests of the commune members and the long-term interests, collective interests, and the two are fundamentally consistent. Under capitalist private ownership, accumulation takes the form of capital accumulation and capitalization of surplus value. The expansion of capital accumulation means the intensification and deepening of the exploitation of the proletariat, and the contradiction between accumulation and consumption becomes an antagonistic contradiction, which is an essence of the acute class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Under the socialist public ownership system, the accumulation of people's communes takes the form of expanding productive and non-productive capital construction and increasing production working capital, which is the source of expanded reproduction. It is the continuous accumulation of a part of net income to continuously expand reproduction, increase social (and people's communes') material wealth, and continuously improve the welfare of the people (and the commune members). Therefore, in the income distribution of people's communes, the increase in the consumption part is the benefit of the members, and the increase in the accumulation part is also the benefit of the members. From a fundamental point of view, the two are consistent, and there is no antagonistic contradiction.

    Third, however, when dealing with the relationship between accumulation and consumption, people's communes must also pay attention to: there is actually a certain non-antagonistic contradiction between the two, which is the contradiction between current interests and long-term interests, the contradiction between personal interests and collective interests, and the contradiction between local interests and overall interests (the interests of the whole people), which is a form of internal contradiction of the people. These contradictions must be handled correctly. State taxation and the commune's public accumulation fund should not be too little, because if they are too little, it will be unfavorable to the development of production and the development of the entire socialist construction cause; however, it should not be too much, especially under the current production level of people's communes, and in the early days of running people's communes. If there is too much accumulation, it will also be unfavorable to the development of production and the development and consolidation of people's communes. The Central Committee of the Party instructed: "The part of the income distributed to members by people's communes should generally account for about 60% of the total income of the commune." According to the current production level of general people's communes, such regulations are in line with the actual situation (except for a few communes with much higher production income). When dealing with the ratio of accumulation to consumption in people's communes, the principle we follow is: to ensure the continuous increase of accumulation, continuously expand the socialist reproduction of the commune, and to ensure the continuous growth of the consumption part of the commune members and continuously improve the material and cultural lives of the commune members. This is the principle and law of socialist accumulation.

    The Development Prospects of People's Communes

    Our country's people's communes were created under the brilliant light of the socialist construction general line formulated by the Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, in the great victory of the socialist rectification movement and the great leap forward of socialist construction. It fully reflects the urgent desire of the working people of our country to get rid of the backwardness of "poor and blank," and also fully reflects the ideological and consciousness level greatly improved by the farmers of our country after the long-term revolutionary war, land reform, and socialist transformation movement. The socialist nature of the people's communes at the present stage and the ownership and distribution system of the means of production implemented by them are completely in line with the laws of historical development. Therefore, people's communes are like the rising sun in the east and have unlimited vitality.

    People's communes will accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country and will play a huge superiority in the continued great leap forward of agricultural production. With the continuous development of agricultural production, the production income level of the entire people's commune will continue to increase, and the imbalance in the economic conditions and production development between teams will gradually change. The state's annual investment of 1 billion yuan in people's communes will further promote this change of imbalance; on the basis of the continuous improvement of the production income level and the continuous increase of public accumulation of the entire commune, the public accumulation at the commune level will also inevitably continue to increase, and the public economy commonly owned by the entire commune will inevitably continue to expand, and the state's investment in the commune will also increase year by year; at the same time, modern agricultural technical equipment will inevitably continue to increase with the development of national industrialization, and these equipment will be mainly controlled by the commune level; all this is to gradually transform from small collective ownership (that is, the ownership at the current production team level is basic) to large collective ownership (that is, the ownership at the future commune level is basic), and to gradually transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people. We firmly believe that after several years, people's communes will gradually transform from small collective ownership to large collective ownership, and then gradually transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and prepare a good foundation for the transition to communism after the completion of socialist construction tasks in the future.

　　论人民公社的所有制和分配制度
　　陈正人
    人民公社的性质
    我国农村的人民公社在现阶段的性质是社会主义的，生产资料是集体所有的，分配原则是各尽所能，按劳分配。在人民公社的集体所有制中已经包含有若干全民所有制的成分，这种成分将会逐步地增长。人民公社目前还实行着工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，而供给制则带有按需分配的原则的萌芽。人民公社将成为由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的最好形式，将成为我国社会由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好形式。但是，这些并没有改变人民公社在现阶段的社会主义集体所有制的性质。
    人民公社化运动一开始，在1958年8月29日，党中央根据毛泽东同志的提议通过的“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”就明确指出：“人民公社建成以后，不要忙于改集体所有制为全民所有制，……实际上，人民公社的集体所有制中，就已经包含有若干全民所有制的成分了。这种全民所有制，将在不断发展中继续增长，逐步地代替集体所有制。由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡是一个过程……过渡到了全民所有制，如国营工业那样，它的性质还是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳分配。然后再经过多少年，社会产品极大地丰富了，全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了，社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，都逐步地消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余，也逐步地消失了，国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了，在这种时候，我国社会就将进入各尽所能，按需分配的共产主义时代。”决议的这一段话，对于现阶段我国的社会和我国农村人民公社的性质，已经说得明明白白。其后，在同年12月，中国共产党八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，又引证了这一段话，并且做了系统的详尽的阐述。
    农村人民公社目前实行的分配制度，就是根据对于现阶段人民公社性质的这种客观的马克思列宁主义的分析制定的。在人民公社化运动的最初几个月，由于缺乏经验，也由于少数一部分干部，没有弄清人民公社在现阶段的性质，因而在人民公社的经营管理和分配问题上，曾经出现过某些过分集中的倾向和某些平均主义的倾向。党中央和毛泽东同志及时地批判了这些倾向，并且帮助各地在半年多以来的整顿巩固人民公社的工作中，从思想上到实际工作上积极地系统地加以克服。
    人民公社的所有制
    要分析人民公社的分配制度，就要先从人民公社的生产资料所有制谈起。因为，分配制度是由生产资料所有制决定的。生产资料归谁所有，产品就归谁支配：封建主义的土地占有制，农产品就归地主支配；资本主义的私有制，产品就归资本家支配；劳动者的个人所有制，产品就归劳动者个人支配；社会主义的集体所有制，产品就归这个集体的成员根据国家计划共同支配；全民所有制，产品就归代表全体人民的国家支配。
    人民公社的生产资料，土地、耕畜、农具和副业工具等等，目前还是社会主义的集体所有制，并不是社会主义的全民所有制，更不是共产主义的全民所有制。人民公社目前实行生产资料的“三级所有制”和“分级管理、分级核算”，“生产队一级的所有权是基本的，公社一级的所有权是部分的，而生产小队也应该有小部分的所有权”。这就是人民公社目前所实行的所有制。
    为什么人民公社目前要实行三级所有制？又为什么生产队一级的所有权是基本的？主要原因是由于生产队与生产队之间现时的经济条件不尽相同，生产发展的水平和收入水平有高有低，而公社一级直接经营的为全社公有的经济也还不够发展；在这样的条件下，如果实行所有权基本在公社一级，全公社统一核算，统一分配，就将不利于公社内部的团结和生产的发展。所以规定为三级所有制、生产队一级的所有权是基本的，实行分级管理，分级核算。土地、耕畜、农具、副业工具等生产资料基本归生产队所有，生产队是基本核算单位，生产队全体成员集体劳动的产品，除了缴纳国家税收和提出一小部分作为公社的积累基金外，在全生产队的范围内统一分配。人民公社是在高级农业生产合作社的基础上发展起来的，人民公社的生产队大体相当于原来的高级社。生产资料的所有权基本属于生产队，也就是基本上属于大体相当于原来高级社的这个小集体，产品基本归这个集体统一分配。
    有人说“人民公社同原来的高级农业合作社没有什么区别”，“人民公社名存实亡，实际上退回到原来的高级社”。这种说法完全违反事实。因为，公社一级还拥有部分的但是具有重大意义的所有权。除了公社办的公共经济以外，公社还可以逐年从各生产队提取适当的公共积累。这正是公社的伟大未来的一个重要基础。人民公社是政社合一的，公社一级的部分所有权，也就包含着全民所有制的成分。国家从1959年起，计划每年投资十亿元来帮助公社，特别是帮助那一部分经济条件比较差、生产收入比较低的生产队。这一笔国家投资的用途，主要用于扩大再生产的基本建设，这是带有全民所有制的成分，它还将逐年增大。由于人民公社一大、二公和政社合一这样一些特点，人民公社具有比高级社更大的优越性：“组织规模大，活动范围广，可以统一筹划全社的生产和分配，可以比农业生产合作社更有效地充分动员和合理安排农村的劳动力，可以兴办农业生产合作社所难以兴办的建设，便于加快农林牧副渔和工农商学兵的综合发展，便于实现农业机械化，便于实现农民收入的稳定增长和加快农村整个生活的进步，便于发展公共食堂、托儿所等集体事业，在分配中可以有一定的供给制成分，等等”（见党的八届八中全会“关于开展增产节约运动的决议”）。所以，人民公社肯定是高级农业生产合作社的进一步的提高和重大发展。
    生产队下面的生产小队是包产单位，为了明确生产小队的责任和提高它的积极性，也允许它有小部分的所有权。生产小队向生产队包产、包工、包成本，包产部分全部上缴生产队，统一分配，超产部分上缴一定的比例给生产队，其余的归本小队所有，节约下来的生产费用全部归本小队支配。在保证完成生产队布置的农业和副业的生产任务、服从国家市场管理的条件下，生产小队可以经营不便于生产队经营的小型副业生产；在不影响包产任务的前提下，生产小队还应当尽量利用自己管辖范围内的零星土地，这些经营的收入，都归生产小队支配。这一切就是生产小队的小部分所有权的具体表现。
    此外，在人民公社内部，在巩固公社各级的集体所有制的前提下，还保留社员的个体所有制的残余。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出：人民公社“应当向群众宣布：社员个人所有的生活资料（包括房屋、衣被、家具等）和在银行、信用社的存款，在公社化以后，仍然归社员所有，而且永远归社员所有”。“社员可以保留宅旁的零星树木、小农具、小工具、小家畜和家禽等；也可以在不妨碍参加集体劳动的条件下，继续经营一些家庭小副业”。党中央还指示：“要社员私养猪、鸡、鹅、鸭，就要给社员一定数量的自留地”。并且“鼓励社员利用零星空闲的时间，把屋旁、村旁、水旁、路旁的零星闲散的土地充分利用起来。这些土地上长的庄稼，……完全由社员个人自由支配”。这就是大集体中的“小私有”、“小自由”。在人民公社还不能充分照顾和满足社员生活各方面的不同需要的时候，在不影响集体劳动、有利于公共经济的发展的条件下，允许一定范围的“小私有”和“小自由”，这是集体经济的补充，这也有利于人民公社的巩固。但是，它毕竟是一种过渡步骤，它的作用只是对集体经济的补充，夸大了它的作用，热衷于“小私有”和“小自由”，而妨碍集体经济的发展的倾向，则必须防止。
    这就是目前我国人民公社在生产资料所有制方面的具体情况。总之一句话，人民公社现在实行的是社会主义的集体所有制。“生产队一级的所有权是基本的”，反映出人民公社是在高级农业社的基础上发展起来的。公社一级的部分所有权，则包含着若干全民所有制的成分，代表着人民公社的伟大的未来。
    人民公社的分级核算和分配
    正因为人民公社的生产资料是集体所有的，并且，生产队一级的所有权是基本的，所以，人民公社以生产队为基本核算单位，各生产队集体劳动的产品，基本归各该生产队的成员公共所有，共同分配。分配的具体办法是：生产队所管辖的各个综合性的和专业性的生产小队集体劳动的产品，按照包产任务所规定的数量上缴给生产队（有的单位超产了，生产队可以从超产部分提成，有的单位因为天灾等原因减产了，生产队也要承担一部分损失），生产队从这些收入中，按照同生产小队共同商定的包成本的数量扣除生产费用（这里所说的“生产费用”，仅指生产资料的消耗。下同），按照国家的法令交纳公粮和其他税款，按照公社的规定扣除公积金和公益金，其余的部分采取工资制和供给制相结合的形式做为社员的劳动报酬。工资部分按共同商定的包工的劳动日数分配给生产小队，再由生产小队按各个社员实际做的劳动日的多少分配给社员，供给部分按全生产队的人口分配。
    前面已经讲过，作为包产单位的生产小队，还有属于它自己的而不属于生产队的一小部分生产收入。生产小队的这一部分收入，可以由本小队全体社员公议，抽出一小部分作为本小队的公共积累和补助本小队的公共食堂及其他公益事业，其余的大部分和从生产队领来的工资加在一起，按照本小队各个社员所做的劳动日的多少进行分配。
    公社一级，除了它自己直接经营的公共经济单独核算，单独分配以外，还可以从各生产队的公共积累中提成，来扩大为全公社服务的公共经济和公共福利事业的基本建设。公社在必要的时候，可以按照各生产队不同的条件，规定各生产队按照不同的比例扣除公共积累，并且可以按照不同的比例从各生产队的公共积累中提成，以便在一定的范围内，适当调剂队和队之间的社员收入，调剂队和队的公共积累。这一切都是公社一级对于生产资料的部分所有权在分配问题上的具体反映。
    把人民公社各级分级核算和分配的结果综合起来，加以分析，公社总收入的分配是：扣除生产费用，缴纳公粮和其他税款，扣留公积金、公益金，以上各项扣留一般约占公社总收入的40％左右，其余的60％左右，分给社员个人消费。生产费用，用以补偿生产过程中消耗掉的生产资料，这是完全必需的，否则，人民公社就不能维持再生产。公粮和税款交给国家，国家用来投资于工农业生产建设、科学、文化、教育、卫生建设和国防建设等等，是为着全体人民的利益，也是为着人民公社每一个社员的利益。公积金用来扩大人民公社的生产，增加生产性的基本建设，例如购买农业机器、耕畜和其他工具等等；用来增加人民公社的生产流动资金和其他的生产后备力量，例如后备种子等等，这都是不断提高人民公社的生产水平，不断改善公社社员生活所必需的，对于每一个社员都是有利的。公积金的一部分也投资于公社举办的集体福利事业的基本建设，例如，某些人民公社已为社员新建了学校、医院、住宅等等，这些福利事业是归社员共同享受的。公益金用来做为公社举办的学校、医院、托儿所、敬老院和其他各项集体福利事业的经常开支，这是公社社员的集体消费。由此可见，人民公社的总收入，公社社员集体劳动所创造的全部产品，除了补充生产资料的消耗以外，一部分（在目前人民公社的生产水平下，还是比较大的一部分）直接分配给社员个人消费，其余的部分用以缴纳公粮税收、留做公积金、公益金等，归根结底又以这种或者那种形式直接地和间接地用之于社员本身。这就是社会主义的分配与资本主义的分配根本不同的地方。在资本主义私有制下，劳动者的剩余劳动为资本家创造剩余价值。在社会主义的公有制下（人民公社的集体所有制是社会主义公有制的一种形式），劳动者的全部产品都是按照劳动者的利益进行分配的。人民公社的收入分配，完全符合于马克思在哥达纲领批判一书中阐明的社会主义社会分配的基本经济原理。
    人民公社的分配制度
    人民公社所实行的“工资制和供给制相结合”的分配制度，受到了全国广大农民的热烈拥护。右倾机会主义分子，他们攻击这种分配制度，说它违反了社会主义按劳分配的原则。他们以此为借口，来反对人民公社、反对大跃进、反对党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线。
    事实究竟怎样呢？正如本文一开始所引证的，党中央关于人民公社问题的第一个决议（1958年8月29日的决议），就已经指出，现阶段我国人民公社的性质是社会主义的，它实行各尽所能，按劳分配。同年12月，党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”又指出：“分配给社员个人消费的部分，实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，这是我国人民公社在社会主义分配方式上的一个创举，是目前广大社员群众的迫切要求。如前面所说，这种分配制度，具有共产主义的萌芽，但是它的基本性质仍然是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳分配。”对于1959年的夏季分配，中央又指出：“适当限制供给部分，逐渐增加工资部分。在目前的生产水平上，供给部分一般应当限制在只占分配部分的30％左右，最多不超过40％。即工资部分应当占70％左右，最少不少于60％。”
    工资部分是按照每一个社员在集体劳动中所做劳动日的多少进行分配的。供给部分是按照社员及其家属人口的多少进行分配的。由于各个地方各个人民公社的生产水平高低不同，总收入和分配给社员个人消费的总额多少不同，供给部分在分配给社员个人消费的总额中所占的比例虽然大体差不多，但是，对数则有高有低。因此，各个人民公社供给部分所采取的形式也就不一样，按照供给部分绝对数额的多少，能够实行伙食供给制的，就实行伙食供给制（包括口粮和油盐柴菜）；不能实行伙食供给制的，就实行口粮供给制；如果粮食供给制也不能实行的，就实行半口粮供给制，口粮不足的部分，由其所得的工资部分中补足。还有少数人民公社，由于生产水平过低，或者其他原因，没有实行供给制，仍然采取过去高级农业社的办法，只对鳏寡孤独和老弱残废的社员实行“五保”，并且对其他生活确实困难的社员酌情给以补助。
    一切有劳动力的公社社员，都必须各尽所能地参加劳动。“不劳动者不得食”的社会主义原则，还必须是公社社员共同遵守的原则。所以，人民公社在实行供给制和工资制相结合的分配制度的时候，同时，对于每一个有劳动力的社员，根据各人不同的劳动条件，规定各人在一年一季一月内应该做到多少劳动日，做不够规定的劳动日数，就不能享受供给制的待遇。但是，由于疾病等原因做不满劳动日的人，公社则给以生活上的必要补助。
    由于实行这种部分供给制的分配制度，首先解决了过去农业生产合作社长期没有解决的所谓“超支户”和“分空户”的矛盾问题。在农村中，有一部分人口多而劳力少、劳力弱，或者主要劳动力生病几个月不能参加劳动的农户，他们并不完全是“五保户”，高级社的“五保”办法并不能适应于解决他们的问题。他们过去在农业合作社中，常常是超支的，就是所谓“超支户”。既然有这一部分人超支，因而就有另一部分农户应该分得的东西也不能全部分到手，有拖欠，就是所谓的“分空户”。这个矛盾在合作社时期，长期不得解决。在这种情况下，如果在按劳分配的原则以外，再不采取恰当的辅助的分配办法，就的确难以解决这个矛盾。实行了人民公社化，实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，这个问题就可以基本解决了。所以说，这种分配制度实际是一种最可靠的社会保险，是广大劳动者所共同需要的。
    很显然，农村中的居民，从对于实行部分供给制的影响来划分，大体上可以分为三种：第一种是劳动力少而赡养人口多的农户，包括五保户在内，大约占农村户口的20％左右；第二种是劳动力和赡养人口的比例，同全社全队的平均比例不相上下的农户，大约占农村户口的60％到70％；第三种是劳动力多而赡养人口少的农户，大约占农村户口的百分之十几到二十。实行部分供给制，究竟对于收入分配的影响有多大呢？我们可以算一笔账，譬如有一个生产队总收入一万元，分配给社员个人消费的部分占60％，即六千元；在这六千元中供给部分占30％，即一千八百元，全队人口一百人，供给部分所得每人合十八元；劳力少而赡养人口多的农户（包括五保户在内）按20％的人口，以二十个人计算，他们享受的供给部分合三百六十元；然而，由于粮食供给是实行按人分等定量的，具有一般劳动力的人们定量标准高于平均数，老弱小孩低于平均数，劳动力少而赡养人口多的农户就是老弱小孩占的比例大，因此，他们实际享受的供给部分并不到三百六十元，打个折扣，大约三百元左右，在总收入一万元中不过占3％左右。其中的“五保户”在高级社时期已经实行了五保，去掉这一部分以后，由于公社实行部分供给制所增加的部分，不过占总收入的2％左右。就是这2％，也不是完全无偿给予劳动力少而赡养人口多的农户，因为他们还有一部分劳动力或者辅助劳动力，这2％中间还有一部分是他们应得的劳动报酬。因此，可以肯定的说，这种分配制度没有改变按劳分配的基本原则。五保户和劳动力少而赡养人口多的农户完全拥护这种分配制度。劳动力和赡养人口的比例同全社全队的平均比例不相上下的农户，无论是实行工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度或者完全按劳动日分配，他们的实际收入并不起什么变化，他们从长远看，一般也赞成实行这样的社会保险。劳动力多而赡养人口少的农户，他们想到他们自己也会生儿育女，他们也不能不考虑到自己家庭内的疾病死亡事故的发生，或者看到了敬老院而想到自己年老后的依靠，特别是看到了由于实行工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度以后，在广大农民中所激发起来的劳动热情，对于人民公社的生产发展和收入增加所起的作用，他们中间的多数也能够接受这种分配制度，他们觉得这也是他们自己将来的一种依靠。所以党的六中全会的决议说，这种部分的供给制是“最重要和最可靠的社会保险”，是“广大社员群众的迫切要求。”
    同时，由于人民公社的生产比原来的高级社有了更大发展，收入有了更大增加，实行这种工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，也完全可以做到党的六中全会所要求的“不使劳力强而人口少的户减少收入”，并且可以做到使他们的大多数仍然增加收入。1958年年终分配和1959年夏季预分的实际结果，完全证明了这一点。1958年全国农民的收入，按全部农村人口平均，每人合八十五元左右，比1957年增加10％。又如河南省1959年夏季预分中分配给社员个人消费的部分八亿五千万元，占夏季收入的59％，比1958年同期增长10.3％，比1957年同期增长25.3％。又如广东省海口市郊区附城公社，1959年夏季预分中分配给社员个人消费的一百零七万元，占夏季收入一百九十六万元的54.6％，分配的结果，同1958年同期比较，增加收入的农户占96％，不增不减的农户占1.4％，减少收入的农户占2.6％。这也可以看出，由于人民公社总收入的增加，分配给社员个人消费部分的增多，做到了90％以上的社员增加了收入，就是劳力多而人口少的农户大多数也增加了收入。极少数农户的收入所以减少，主要地并不是由于分配方法中有了一定程度的供给制部分，原因是多方面的，在人民公社化前就有的，也是长期存在的，不同的只是今年这几户减少收入，明年又是另外几户减少收入。此外，由于人民公社集体福利和集体消费部分的增长，很少数的减少收入的社员从集体福利和集体消费方面又得了一部分好处。这就是劳力多而人口少的社员中的大多数同样接受工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度的物质基础。
    应该肯定的说，人民公社在现阶段的分配原则是合乎各尽所能，按劳分配的原则，合乎社会主义按劳分配的规律。而且应该看到，在按劳分配的基础上，辅之以一定分量的供给制的分配办法，是合乎大多数劳动者的共同要求，这也就具有走向共产主义按需分配的萌芽因素，因而也就具有它的不可忽视的生命力。
    人民公社分配中积累和消费的关系
    我们再来看看人民公社分配中积累和消费的关系。
    第一，人民公社的公共积累由于它的生产增长快，因而比高级农业合作社时期增加很多。以山西为例，全省人民公社1958年的公积金为一亿六千二百七十九万元（其中包含一部分公益金没有分开），占全省人民公社全年总收入的11.25％，如果以扣除生产费用以后的收入做为一百，则占15.67％。比1957年高级合作社时期，百分比增加一倍以上（1957年占总收入的5.41％），绝对数增加更多。山西的这个例子，可以代表全国的一般情况。人民公社的公积金实际还包含有一部分生产资料的折旧，不完全是积累。然而，人民公社的积累并不是只表现在公积金这一个方面。它还表现在上缴给国家的公粮税收，这也可以说是公社提供的社会积累（虽然国家财政支出并不完全属于积累性质）。全国总平均，公粮税收大约占公社总收入的7％左右，如果以扣除生产费用以后的收入做为一百，则占10％左右（山西1958年的统计是11.22％）。公社的积累还表现在社员对于公社举办的水利等等农田基本建设所贡献的一部分义务劳动方面。这样几种形式的积累加在一起，人民公社的积累在公社扣除生产费用以后的实际收入中所占的比例大约是30％左右。人民公社所以能够这样高速度的积累，是由于公社的组织规模大，经营范围广，农林牧副渔和社办工业全面发展，公社的收入大大地迅速地增加；同时，人民公社内根本不存在资本剥削和地租剥削，所以，公共积累就有可能在广大社员自觉自愿的基础上更快地增加起来。这只是实现了人民公社化以后第一年的情况，今后随着公社生产的发展，经营管理的改善，勤俭办社原则的进一步贯彻执行，公社的积累一定还会进一步扩大。这充分证明了社会主义经济高速度发展和高速度积累的规律。
    第二，人民公社的收入分配中，积累与消费的关系，是公社社员的目前利益、个人利益与长远利益、集体利益之间的关系，两者根本是一致的。在资本主义私有制的条件下，积累采取资本积累、剩余价值资本化的形式，资本积累的扩大就意味着对无产阶级剥削的加剧和加深，积累与消费之间的矛盾便成为对抗性的矛盾，这正是资产阶级与无产阶级之间尖锐的阶级斗争一种本质的表现。在社会主义公有制的条件下，人民公社的积累采取扩大生产性的和非生产性的基本建设和增加生产流动资金的形式，是扩大再生产的源泉，是利用一部分纯收入的不断积累，来不断扩大再生产，增加社会的（也是人民公社的）物质财富，不断提高人民的（也是公社社员的）福利。所以，人民公社的收入分配中，消费部分的增加是社员的利益，积累部分的增加也是社员的利益，从根本上说来，两者之间是一致的，不存在什么对抗性的矛盾。
    第三，但是，人民公社在处理积累和消费的关系问题时，也必须注意到：两者之间实际存在着一定的非对抗性的矛盾，这就是目前利益与长远利益的矛盾，个人利益与集体利益的矛盾，局部利益与整体利益（全民利益）的矛盾，这是人民内部矛盾的一种形式。必须正确处理这些矛盾。国家税收、公社的公积金不应该过少，过少了，对于生产的发展和整个社会主义建设事业的发展都是不利的；但是，也不能过多，特别是在人民公社目前的生产水平的条件下，在人民公社的办社初期，积累过多了，对于生产的发展和人民公社的发展和巩固，也同样是不利的。党中央指示：“人民公社分给社员消费的部分，一般要占公社总收入的60％左右”。根据目前一般人民公社的生产水平，这样的规定是符合实际的（除了少数生产收入高得多的公社以外）。处理人民公社的积累与消费的比例时，我们遵循的原则是：既保证不断增加积累，不断扩大公社的社会主义再生产，又保证公社社员消费部分的不断增长，不断改善公社社员的物质文化生活。这是社会主义积累的原则和规律。
    人民公社的发展前途
    我国的人民公社是在党中央和毛泽东同志制定的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在社会主义整风运动的伟大胜利和社会主义建设大跃进中产生的。它充分反映了我国劳动人民急于摆脱“一穷二白”的落后面貌的迫切要求，也充分反映了我国农民经过长期的革命战争、土地改革和社会主义改造运动的锻炼，而大大提高了的思想觉悟水平。人民公社在现阶段的社会主义性质及其所实行的生产资料所有制和分配制度，是完全合乎历史发展规律的。因此，人民公社正如旭日之东升，具有无限的生命力。
    人民公社将加速我国社会主义建设的速度，将在农业生产的继续大跃进中发挥巨大的优越性。随着农业生产的不断发展，整个人民公社的生产收入水平将不断提高，队与队之间的经济条件和生产发展不平衡的状况将逐步改变，国家每年对人民公社的十亿元投资，将更加促进这种不平衡状况的改变；在整个公社生产收入水平不断提高和公共积累不断增多的基础上，公社一级的公共积累也必将不断增加，为全公社所公有的公共经济必将不断扩大，国家对公社的投资也逐年加多；同时，农业现代技术装备必将随着国家工业化的发展而不断加多，这些装备将主要是由公社一级掌握的；这一切就为由小集体所有（即目前生产队一级的所有权是基本的）逐步转变到大集体所有（即将来公社一级的所有权是基本的）准备了条件，为由社会主义的集体所有制逐步过渡到社会主义的全民所有制准备了条件。我们深信：人民公社经过若干年的时间，将逐步地由小集体所有制转变到大集体所有制，进而逐步地由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，并且为将来在社会主义建设任务完成以后，过渡到共产主义准备好良好的基础。
