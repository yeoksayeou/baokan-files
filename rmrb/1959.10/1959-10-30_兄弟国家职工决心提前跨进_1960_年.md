    Brotherly Countries' Workers Determined to Enter 1960 Ahead of Schedule
    Vietnam: Many enterprises complete their annual production plans more than two months ahead of schedule
    Czechoslovakia: Workers in various regions strive in the fourth quarter to secure greater victories next year
    Romania: Workers tap potential to double the original savings targets

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th: The campaign of increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial front in North Vietnam continues to develop.
    Good news from the Vietnamese capital to remote rural areas is encouraging. Many factories and enterprises have successfully completed their annual production plans for 1959.
    The Hanoi State-owned Peace Auto Repair Factory recently completed the year's state production plan seventy-eight days ahead of schedule. On October 24, the factory's team, with gongs and drums, and holding high the achievement charts, reported their great victory to the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Labor Party, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, and the Hanoi Administrative Committee. The factory was able to successfully complete its annual production plan because, after enterprise reform, workers directly participated in enterprise management, their enthusiasm for labor was unprecedentedly high, they actively improved technology, and greatly increased labor productivity. According to statistics, the average productivity of workers this year has increased by 34.56% compared to last year.
    The Zuo Tian Zinc Mine Geological Exploration Team completed this year's survey plan three months ahead of schedule. The team had a heavy survey task this year; however, all the members mustered their energy, boldly innovated technology, bravely overcame difficulties, and constantly created new records.
    In addition, the Hanoi Ice Factory, the Hanoi Brewery, the Hanoi Asbestos Cement Board Factory, the Haiphong No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory, the Lao Cai Apatite Mine, and the Thanh Hoa Automobile Transportation Company, as well as many factory workshops and production teams, have all completed their annual production plans for 1959 ahead of schedule.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague: While discussing the targets for the 1960 economic construction plan, the Czechoslovak working people have seen a new high tide in production. Many workers in industrial and mining enterprises have expressed their determination to complete this year's production plans ahead of schedule and strive for greater victories next year.
    During the discussion of the 1960 plan targets, the workers, with a spirit of innovation, put forward tens of thousands of suggestions for tapping potential, improving technology, saving raw materials, and increasing labor productivity, greatly increasing the task targets of their factories and mines. For example, after discussion at the Koshis Iron Mine, the workers proposed to increase the original production target by 1.5%, and to change the original increase in labor productivity from 2.6% to 7%. Workers at the country's largest Stalin Chemical Plant put forward five thousand useful suggestions, deciding to produce 26 million crowns (Czech currency) more products than originally planned in 1960. The world-renowned Lenin Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant will increase its output value by 94 million crowns in 1960, and revise the target of increasing labor productivity from 8.5% to 9%. This factory also guarantees to overfulfill the original task of saving eight thousand tons of raw materials.
    In the discussion, the workers also proposed that overfulfilling this year's production tasks is an important prerequisite for raising the 1960 targets. After successfully completing the production tasks for the first three quarters of this year, they have confidently started the fourth quarter of production. Especially after carrying out discussions on the 1960 plan and recently announcing the targets for the Third Five-Year Plan, production in many industrial sectors across the country has shown a good trend of linear increase. Recently, good news has been pouring in from many industrial and mining enterprises, who have been making guarantees to complete this year's tasks ahead of schedule. Workers in Gottwaldov State have said they will complete this year's tasks a week ahead of schedule, and produce more than 110 million crowns worth of products this year. They also guarantee to complete overseas orders half a month ahead of schedule and reduce costs by 70 million crowns. Four metallurgical factories in Homutov and other places will over-produce six hundred tons of steel, one thousand one hundred tons of steel, and six hundred and fifty tons of steel pipes in the last quarter of this year.
    1960 is the final year of Czechoslovakia's Second Five-Year Plan. The successful realization of the 1960 plan is of great significance for Czechoslovakia to complete socialist construction in 1965. According to the thousands of socialist guarantees put forward by various factories after discussion, there is no doubt that the original 1960 plan targets will be greatly exceeded.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 27th: The broad masses of workers and staff in Romanian factories and enterprises are extensively developing a campaign to save resources and tap production potential. Building on the achievements already made, they have doubled the original savings targets for this year.
    At the beginning of this year, workers throughout Romania launched a heated savings campaign. At that time, according to the guarantees put forward by various factories and enterprises, nearly one billion lei (Romanian currency) would be saved this year. This competition achieved good results in the first half of the year. For example, enterprises in the capital alone saved nearly 100 million lei in the first half of the year. After the plenary session of the Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee in July this year, encouraged by the resolutions of the plenary session, the broad masses of workers and staff across the country decided to push this fruitful savings campaign to a new stage. They further tapped internal potential and increased savings targets. According to the guarantees put forward by workers and staff, nearly two billion lei will be saved across the country this year.
    The new savings plan was formulated after repeated and in-depth research by all workers and staff. After discussing the resolutions of the Central Committee plenary session, the "August 23" factory immediately formed thirty-six groups with four hundred engineers, technicians, and advanced workers to study the possibility of saving. Together with all the workers in the factory, they put forward more than two thousand rationalization proposals, and at the same time increased the savings plan from the original 6.6 million lei to 10.3 million lei based on many practical suggestions. Many factories and enterprises have also more than doubled their savings plans. Now, many factories and enterprises are smoothly realizing their savings plans, and many units are overfulfilling their savings tasks every month.
    In order to make the realization of this year's savings plan more guaranteed, the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations of various factories and enterprises have taken many measures to improve workers' technical level, carry out rationalization proposal campaigns, and promote advanced working methods. The practice of advanced workers leading backward production teams has been universally promoted in industrial and mining enterprises across the country, and has achieved good results. "Rationalization Proposal Month" and "Experience Exchange Day" have become regular activities in many factories and enterprises.

    兄弟国家职工决心提前跨进1960年
    越南：　许多企业提前两个多月完成全年生产计划
    捷克斯洛伐克：各地职工奋战第四季度争取明年更大胜利
    罗马尼亚：职工大挖潜力要把原订节约指标提高一倍
    据新华社河内28日电　越南北方工业战线上开展的增产节约竞赛继续向前发展。
    从越南首都到僻远的农村不断传来的捷报令人欢欣鼓舞。许多工厂企业胜利地完成了1959年全年生产计划。
    河内国营和平汽车修理厂最近提前七十八天完成了全年国家生产计划。10月24日，这个厂的职工组成的报喜队，打着锣鼓，高举着成绩图表，到河内劳动党市委会、越南总工会、河内行政委员会报告了他们取得的巨大胜利。这个工厂能够胜利完成全年生产计划，是由于经过企业改革以后，工人直接参加了企业管理，劳动热情空前提高，积极改进技术，大大提高了劳动生产率。据统计，今年工人们的平均生产率比去年提高了34.56％。
    佐田锌矿地质勘探队提前三个月完成了今年的勘测计划。这个队今年的勘测任务繁重；但是，全队人员鼓足干劲，大胆革新技术，勇敢地克服困难，不断地创造了新纪录。
    此外，河内制冰厂、河内啤酒厂、河内石棉水泥板厂、海防第一制药厂、老街磷灰石矿和清化汽车运输公司以及许多厂矿的车间、生产小组都提前完成了1959年全年生产计划。
    据新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在讨论1960年的经济建设计划指标时，生产出现新的高潮，许多工矿企业职工表示决心提前完成今年生产计划，争取明年更大的胜利。
    在讨论1960年的计划指标时，工人们以革新的精神提出了上万条挖掘潜力、改进技术、节约原料和提高劳动生产率的建议，大大提高了自己厂矿的任务指标。如科息斯铁矿在讨论后，工人们提出要提高原订生产指标1.5％，劳动生产率由原订的提高2.6％改为提高7％。全国最大的斯大林化学工厂的工人提出了五千件有益的建议，他们决定在1960年内比原计划多生产二千六百万克朗（捷币）的产品。世界闻名的列宁重型机器制造工厂，在1960年中将提高产值九千四百万克朗，并把提高劳动生产率8.5％的指标改订为提高9％。这个工厂还保证超额完成原订节约八千吨原材料的任务。
    在讨论中，工人们并且提出，超额完成今年生产任务是提高1960年指标的重要前提。他们在胜利完成今年前三个季度的生产任务后，已满怀信心地开始了第四季度的生产。特别是在开展对1960年计划的讨论和最近宣布第三个五年计划的指标后，全国许多工业部门的生产都出现了直线上升的良好形势。近来，许多工矿企业捷报频传，纷纷提出提前完成今年任务的保证。哥特瓦尔德夫州的工人表示要提前一周完成今年的任务，并在今年多生产一亿一千多万克朗的产品。他们还保证要提前半个月完成国外的订货和减低成本七千万克朗。霍穆托夫等地的四个冶金工厂将在今年最后一个季度中超计划生产六百吨钢，一千一百吨钢材和六百五十吨钢管。
    1960年是捷克斯洛伐克第二个五年计划的最后一年，1960年计划的胜利实现，对捷克斯洛伐克在1965年完成社会主义建设具有重大意义。根据目前各工厂经过讨论后所提出的成千上万的社会主义保证看来，毫无疑问原订的1960年计划指标将被大大超过。
    据新华社布加勒斯特27日电罗马尼亚各工厂企业的广大职工正在深入开展节约竞赛运动，大挖生产潜力。他们在已经获得的成就的基础上，把今年原订节约指标提高了一倍。
    罗马尼亚全国职工在今年初就展开了热烈的节约竞赛，当时根据各工厂企业提出的保证，今年将节约近十亿列伊（罗币）。这个竞赛在上半年获得了良好成绩。例如，仅首都各企业在上半年就节约了将近一亿列伊。罗马尼亚工人党今年七月中央全会后，全国广大职工在全会决议的鼓舞下，决定把这个成果丰硕的节约竞赛推向一个新的阶段，他们纷纷进一步挖掘内部潜力，提高节约指标。根据职工们提出的保证，今年全国将节约近二十亿列伊。
    新的节约计划是经过全体职工反复深入地研究后制订的。“八月二十三日”工厂在讨论了中央全会的决议后，立即由四百名工程师、技师和先进工人组成了三十六个小组，研究节约的可能性。他们同全厂职工一起提出了二千多条合理化建议，同时根据许多实际可行的建议把节约计划由原来的六百六十万列伊增加到一千零三十万列伊。许多工厂企业也都把节约计划增加了一倍以上。现在许多工厂企业都在顺利地实现着自己的节约计划，许多单位每月都超额完成了节约任务。
    为了使今年节约计划的实现更加有保证，各工厂企业的党、行政和工会组织都采取了许多措施来提高工人的技术水平，开展合理化建议运动和推广先进工作方法。先进工作者领导落后生产队的做法已在全国工矿企业中普遍推行，并且取得了良好效果。“合理化建议月”、“经验交流日”在许多工厂企业中已经成为定期的活动。
