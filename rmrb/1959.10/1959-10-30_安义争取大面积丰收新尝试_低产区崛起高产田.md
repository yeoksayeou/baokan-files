Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 25th: Rural cadres in An'yi County, Jiangxi Province, are expanding their experimental fields from small plots of one or two mu to large-scale, high-yield experimental plots of ten or one hundred mu. At the same time, they are moving from high-yield fields to low-yield fields for experimentation. Currently, cadres at all levels in the county, along with technicians and experienced farmers, are jointly cultivating over 1,000 high-yield experimental plots of late autumn and winter crops, covering an area of over 14,000 mu.

The expansion of experimental fields by rural cadres at all levels has greatly encouraged the masses to strive for large-scale bumper harvests of winter wheat. In the past, some commune members believed that the small size of the experimental fields, ample fertilizer, and large labor input made high yields unsurprising. Therefore, they said: the high-yield experience of small plots cannot be promoted on a large scale. Now that cadres are conducting large-scale high-yield experimental plots, these arguments have been eliminated. Last year, cadres of the Shibi Commune cultivated three mu of experimental fields, with a yield exceeding 700 jin per mu, more than double the yield of ordinary fields. However, some commune members were not convinced, saying: the high-yield experience of three mu of fields cannot be promoted on a large scale. After the summer harvest this year, the cadres of this commune cultivated five late rice high-yield experimental plots, covering an area of 800 mu. They are now ripening, and according to estimates by experienced farmers and technicians, the yield per mu can reach 800 jin, an increase of 90% compared to this year's bumper early rice harvest. The commune members praised, saying: we will comprehensively promote the advanced experience of the cadre's experimental plots next year to strive for large-scale bumper harvests.

In order to transform the low-yield fields, which account for 20% of the county's total cultivated land, into high-yield fields, cadres at all levels in the county responded to the call of the county Party committee and established high-yield experimental plots in low-yield areas with the worst water sources, soil quality, and sunlight. Currently, cadres at all levels in the county have established 43 high-yield experimental plots in low-yield areas, covering an area of over 1,300 mu, accounting for 14% of the total area of experimental plots in the county. Currently, the late rice in the low-yield fields is growing as well as in the high-yield fields. The fact that low-yield fields are beginning to be transformed into high-yield fields has created good experience for the county to further tap the potential of low-yield fields.

When cultivating experimental fields, cadres at all levels in An'yi County also conducted dozens of experiments such as variety comparison, seed comparison, dense planting comparison, and fertilization comparison, and learned a set of successful yield-increasing experiences from the comparative experiments. These experiences have greatly promoted and guided current production.

    安义争取大面积丰收新尝试
    低产区崛起高产田
    新华社南昌25日电　江西省安义县农村干部种试验田，已由过去种一亩、两亩的小块试验田发展到十亩、百亩的大面积高产试验坂；同时又从高产田搬到低产田搞试验。现在，全县各级干部和技术员、老农合种的晚秋作物和冬季作物高产试验坂共一千多个，面积达一万四千多亩。
    各级农村干部扩大种植试验田的面积对鼓舞广大群众争取冬小麦大面积丰收有很大作用。过去，有些社员认为试验田面积小、肥料足、劳力大，创造高产不足为奇；因此他们说：小块面积的丰产经验不能大面积推广。现在干部搞大面积高产试验坂，便消除了这些说法。石鼻公社干部去年搞了三亩试验田，亩产超过七百斤，比一般田产量高一倍；可是部分社员不信服，说：三亩田的高产经验不能大面积推广。今年夏收后，这个社的干部搞了五个晚稻高产试验坂，面积八百亩，现已黄熟，据老农、技术员逐丘估计，亩产可达八百斤，比今年丰收的早稻可增产九成。社员们个个称赞说：我们明年要全面推广干部试验坂的先进经验，争取大面积丰收。
    为了使全县占总耕地面积20％的低产田变高产田，全县各级干部响应县委号召，到水源、土质、阳光最差的低产地区建立高产试验坂。现在，全县各级干部已在低产地区建立了四十三个高产试验坂，面积有一千三百多亩，占全县试验坂总面积的14％。目前低产田的晚稻与高产田的长得一样好。低产田被开始改变为高产田的事实，为全县进一步挖掘低产田的潜力创造了良好经验。
    安义县各级干部在种试验田时，还曾作了品种比较、种子比较、密植比较和施肥比较等几十种试验，并且从对比试验中摸到了一套成功的增产经验。这些经验对当前生产起了很大的推动和指导作用。
