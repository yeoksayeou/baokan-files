Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 22nd: The 18 million commune members in Guangxi's rural people's communes, full of spirit, are gearing up for the winter production movement, including winter planting, water conservancy, and fertilizer accumulation, to strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

Guangxi's rural situation has been very good since the beginning of the year, and the current situation is even better. This is the result of the continuous anti-rightist, morale-boosting efforts of rural cadres and the broad masses of commune members throughout the region, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, holding high the red flag of the general line of socialist construction and forging ahead courageously. Since late August, from the regional party committee to the rural branches, cadre meetings have been held at all levels to deeply study and implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, analyze the favorable situation for continued great leaps forward, and seriously criticize various right-leaning thoughts and emotions such as fearing difficulties and slackening efforts, being content with mediocrity, not daring to boldly lead mass movements, letting go of increased production measures, and thinking that the lower the contract production targets, the better. A hot and vibrant new situation quickly emerged in the rural areas of the region, with everyone striving to be upstream and advanced. The movement to become upstream communes, the six-good movement, and the model worker movement were in full swing. Counties competed with counties, communes with communes, brigades with brigades, teams with teams, and commune members with commune members, striving to be advanced. On the basis of continuously criticizing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, tapping production potential, and adding increased production measures, the production teams of each commune universally revised the surpassing contract production plans for late autumn crops, with general overproduction targets increasing from about 15% to 20% to 30%; many areas have also put forward the grand goal of achieving a county with 800 catties per mu, a commune with 1,000 catties per mu, and a brigade with 1,500 catties per mu this year.

On the grain front, following the great bumper harvest of early rice, mid-season rice has also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with reports of large-scale bumper harvests spreading everywhere. In the high-altitude mountainous area of northern Guangxi, Longsheng Autonomous County, the average yield per mu of 70,000 mu of mid-season rice was 700 catties, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year; in Kelong Commune, Longlin Autonomous County, which borders western Guangxi and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the yield per mu of 1,700 mu of mid-season rice was 786 catties, an increase of 45% compared to last year; in Mubi County, which borders Vietnam, more than 15,000 mu of mid-season rice have been harvested, with an average yield per mu of 855 catties, an increase of about 20% compared to last year.

At the same time, the late-season field management is deepening step by step. The labor force for field management has increased sharply, doubling compared to mid-August, reaching 6.5 million people. This year, four days before the autumnal equinox, all 11 million mu of late rice in the autonomous region completed three cultivations and three topdressings, with an average topdressing of 80 to 100 dan per mu (of which refined fertilizer accounted for more than half). More than 1.3 million cadres and commune members throughout the region formed field armies and shock teams, setting up camps in mountain rushes and fields, specializing in eliminating low-yielding fields. After about ten days of assault, a large number of third-class seedlings were upgraded.

Entering late September, the region launched a battle to seize grain from drought. The drought occurred in late September, came fiercely, and developed rapidly, but the 2.5 million heroes on the drought resistance front were even more determined and energetic to overcome the drought demon and defend the harvest. After nearly a month of hard work, the drought demon's ferocity has been suppressed. As of October 16, the region had rescued 3.5 million mu of drought-affected crops, accounting for about 80% of the drought-affected area, and the development of drought conditions in late rice paddies has been basically contained. At present, the late rice in the region has entered the heading and grain-filling stage, miscellaneous grains and oil crops are blooming and bearing fruit one after another, and it is a foregone conclusion that the late crop will surpass the early crop.

Now, the over-contract production movement centered on grain is developing in an all-round way. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are booming, and people are going to the mountains and forests in groups to collect wild plants. In early October, more than 58,000 people in the autonomous region carried out a rush to harvest pine resin, and the purchase volume of pine resin increased by 24% compared to the first ten days of the previous month. The autonomous region purchased more than 214,000 dan of wild fibers in September, equivalent to 42.4% of the total purchase volume from January to August. The purchased wild starch raw materials are also equivalent to 54.7% of the total purchase volume from January to August. The breeding of livestock and poultry has also grown rapidly. By the end of September, the number of pigs in stock in the autonomous region reached 4.5 million, an increase of more than 500,000 compared to two months ago; the number of chickens, ducks, and geese in stock totaled more than 34.56 million, an increase of more than 11.08 million compared to two months ago.

An unprecedentedly huge winter production movement of winter planting, water conservancy, and fertilizer accumulation has already begun in the autonomous region. Many counties, communes, and brigades have already formulated grand development plans for next year and even longer-term periods. On the basis of the great victory of the current over-contract production movement, the situation of a greater leap forward in the rural areas of the region next year has emerged, and an even more magnificent prospect is encouraging people to forge ahead courageously.

    批判右倾思想　大搞群众运动
    广西农村冬季生产上马扬鞭
    秋粮超夏粮已成定局，超包产运动全面发展
    据新华社南宁22日电　广西一千八百万农村人民公社社员，意气风发，为争取明年农业生产更大跃进的冬种、水利、积肥等冬季生产运动，也已上马扬鞭，快速前进。
    广西农村形势，从年初以来就是很好的，当前形势更好。这是全区农村干部和广大社员群众在党的八届八中全会的号召下，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲，高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗奋勇前进的结果。8月下旬以来，从区党委到农村支部，层层召开干部会议，深入学习贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，分析继续大跃进的有利形势，严肃地批判了那些畏难松劲、甘居中游、不敢大胆领导群众运动、对增产措施放任自流、认为包产指标越低越好等各式各样的右倾思想情绪。全区农村迅速出现了一个热气腾腾，到处争上游、争先进的新局面。十几万农村干部，都深入到生产第一线；广大社员群众，更是心情振奋，斗志昂扬。争上游公社运动、六好运动、标兵能手运动，搞得热火朝天。县与县、公社与公社、大队与大队、小队与小队、社员与社员之间，你追我赶，争取先进。在不断反右倾、鼓干劲，挖掘增产潜力，追加增产措施的基础上，各公社的生产队，普遍修订了晚秋作物的超包产计划，一般超产指标都由原来的一成五左右提高到二成至三成；还有不少地区提出了今年实现亩产八百斤县、一千斤公社、一千五百斤大队的宏伟目标。
    在粮食战线上，继早稻大丰收之后，中稻又获得空前大丰收，大面积丰收的捷报四处频传。北部高寒山区的龙胜各族自治县，七万亩中稻平均亩产七百斤，比去年增产二成以上；西部和云贵高原接壤的隆林各族自治县克长公社，一千七百多亩中稻亩产七百八十六斤，比去年增产四成五；与越南交界的睦边县，已收中稻一万五千多亩，平均亩产八百五十五斤，比去年增产约两成。
    与此同时，晚造的后期田间管理，步步深入。田间管理的劳动大军，比8月中旬激增一倍，达到六百五十万人。今年在秋分前四天，全自治区一千一百多万亩晚稻就全部完成了三耘三追，平均每亩追肥达八十到一百担（其中精肥占一半以上）。全区一百三十余万名干部和社员，组成了野战军、突击队，在山冲田头安营扎寨，专职消灭低产田。经过十天左右的突击，使大量的三类苗升了级。
    进入9月下旬，全区又开展了一场与干旱夺粮的搏斗。旱象在9月下旬发生，来势很猛，发展很快，但是，抗旱战线上的二百五十万英雄们，战胜旱魔、保卫丰收的决心更大，干劲更足。经过将近一个月的苦战，旱魔的凶焰已被压下去了。到10月16日，全区已抢救受旱作物三百五十万亩，约占受旱面积的80％，晚稻稻田旱情发展已基本制止。目前，全区晚稻已含胎灌浆，杂粮和油料作物陆续扬花结实，晚造超早造已成定局。
    现在，全区以粮食为中心的超包产运动，正向全面发展。林、牧、副、渔等多种经营蒸蒸日上，人们成群结队，上山入林，采集野生植物。10月上旬全自治区五万八千多人，突击采割松脂，松脂采购量比前月上旬增加24％。自治区9月份收购野生纤维达二十一万四千多担，等于1至8月总收购量的42.4％。收购的野生淀粉原料也等于1至8月份总收购量的54.7％。家畜家禽的养殖也迅速增长，到9月底止，全自治区生猪存栏数达四百五十万头，比两月前增长了五十万多头；鸡鸭鹅存栏数共达三千四百五十六万多只，比两月前增加了一千一百零八万多只。
    一个空前巨大的冬种、水利、积肥等冬季生产运动，已经在全自治区揭开了序幕。许多县、公社、大队已经订出明年以及更长期的宏伟发展规划，在当前超包产运动伟大胜利的基础上，全区农村明年更大跃进的形势已经出现，一幅更加壮丽的前景，正鼓舞着人们奋勇前进。
