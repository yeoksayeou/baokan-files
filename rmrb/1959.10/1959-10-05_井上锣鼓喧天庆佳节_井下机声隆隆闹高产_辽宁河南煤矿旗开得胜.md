(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) On October 1st, two hundred thousand coal mine workers in Liaoning Province celebrated the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation with an outstanding production achievement of overproducing more than 10,000 tons of coal. On this day, the province produced a total of more than 160,000 tons of coal, exceeding the planned daily output level for October by 7.19%; and more than 4,000 tons more than the average daily output in late September.

The coal mine workers in Liaoning Province concluded the last month of the third quarter with an achievement of increasing coal production by 800,000 tons. After completing the national plan for September ahead of schedule, they actively prepared to seize a good start in October. At midnight on September 30th, when the people who were going to parade the next day were still asleep, the sound of coal mining guns rang out in the mines. Many Party and government leading cadres also went to the site to work with the workers. Qiu Xinye, First Secretary of the CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee, went to the Haizhou Open-pit Mine, and Liu Ming, Director of the Fushun Mining Bureau, went to the Longfeng Mine underground, which further inspired the labor enthusiasm of the coal miners.

(Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou) The Hebi Coal Mine workers had a good start in production in October. On the 1st, the entire mine produced more than 15,000 tons of raw coal, exceeding the average daily output in September by 75%.

On this day, gongs and drums filled the People's Square in Hebi City to celebrate the festival, and the rumble of machines in the mine shafts heralded high production. The enthusiasm of the workers was greater in each shift, and the output of raw coal was higher in each shift. The first shift produced 4,706 tons of coal, and the second shift increased to 5,605 tons.

On October 1st, after the staff of each unit held a meeting to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, they all participated in the battle to seize coal. Leading cadres at all levels of the CPC Hebi Municipal Committee and the Mining Bureau also went down the mine to solve key production problems and fought alongside the workers.

(Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou) In Pingdingshan, a newly built coking coal production base in Henan, more than 20,000 miners had a successful start in the battle to seize coal in October. On the 1st, the entire mine produced more than 21,000 tons of raw coal, an increase of 24.2% over the average daily output in late September.

On October 1st, colorful flags were flying and gongs and drums were sounding everywhere in the new mining area, which stretches for more than 40 li. While celebrating the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the miners enthusiastically launched a socialist labor competition, and mines, districts, and teams all found competitors. The Longshanmiao Mine created an unprecedented record of producing 7,524 tons of raw coal per day, nearly reaching one time its designed capacity. The average daily output of the other mines also increased by more than 20% compared to late September.

According to our newspaper, on October 1st, the staff and workers of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, while celebrating the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, created a record daily output of 30,000 tons of raw coal. The output on this day increased by 54% compared with the average daily output in September.

On this day, various factories and mines held the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the production oath-taking meeting together. The miners launched heated challenges to each other at the conference. The Wangfeng Mine took the lead in breaking through the 10,000-ton mark of daily raw coal production, an increase of more than 50% compared with the average daily output in September. The Lifeng Mine also created a new achievement of producing 6,530 tons per day, an increase of 2,676 tons of coal compared with September 30.
