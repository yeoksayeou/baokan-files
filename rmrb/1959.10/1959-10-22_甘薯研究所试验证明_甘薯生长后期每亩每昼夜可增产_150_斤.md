    Sweet Potato Research Institute Proves
    Sweet Potato Yield Can Increase by 150 Jin Per Mu Per Day in Late Growth Stage
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st - The Sweet Potato Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, located in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, recently conducted scientific experiments and discovered that sweet potatoes grow very quickly in the later stages. If late-stage management is well strengthened, the average yield of sweet potatoes can be increased by 150 jin per mu per day.
    The main reason for the rapid increase in weight of sweet potatoes in the later stage is: after Bailu (White Dew) and Autumn Equinox, the stems and leaves of sweet potato plants are very lush and have a strong ability to manufacture nutrients. At this time, the temperature turns lower, especially the temperature at night is lower than during the day, so the respiration of plants at night is weaker, consuming less nutrients, and the nutrients manufactured during the day can be sent to the tubers for storage in greater quantities. Based on these findings, appropriately extending the growing period in the later stage of sweet potato growth, under the premise of protecting stems and leaves and not suffering from frost, has a significant effect on increasing production.
    The vines and leaves of sweet potatoes have a significant effect. They can use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into substances such as starch and sugar through the action of chlorophyll, and transport them to the tubers. If the vines and leaves are damaged, the yield of tubers will be greatly reduced. Recently, the Sweet Potato Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted an experiment in Dingzui Commune, Suqian County: Those whose leaves were removed on September 21 yielded 2,162 jin per mu after fifteen days, while those whose leaves were not removed yielded 2,818 jin per mu. Leaf removal resulted in a yield reduction of 23.3% per mu. Therefore, topping and leaf removal, and early harvesting, will affect sweet potato yield.
    Although sweet potatoes are very sensitive to temperature, they will not die as long as the temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius, and they can continue to grow above 16 degrees Celsius. Past experiments and mass experiences have also proved that sweet potato tubers will continue to grow even after the plants suffer from light frost.

### 甘薯研究所试验证明  甘薯生长后期每亩每昼夜可增产150斤

    甘薯研究所试验证明
    甘薯生长后期每亩每昼夜可增产150斤
    新华社南京21日电　设在江苏省宿迁县的中国农业科学院甘薯研究所，最近经过科学试验，发现甘薯生长后期长得很快，如果很好地加强后期管理，每亩甘薯平均每昼夜可以增加产量一百五十斤。
    甘薯后期份量增长快的主要原因是：白露、秋分以后，甘薯植株茎叶生长已很茂盛，制造养分的能力很强。这时，气温转低，特别是夜晚的温度比白天低，因此植株夜晚呼吸作用较弱，消耗养分较少，白天制造出的养分，就能更多地送进薯块贮存。根据这些情况看来，甘薯生长后期，在保护茎叶和不遭受霜冻的前提下，适当延长生长期，对增产是有显著作用的。
    甘薯藤叶的作用很大，它能利用阳光通过叶绿素作用把碳酸气和水制成淀粉和糖一类的物质，输送给薯块。如果损坏了藤叶，薯块产量就会大大降低。最近中国农业科学院甘薯研究所在宿迁县丁咀公社进行了试验：9月21日摅叶的，经十五天后亩产二千一百六十二斤，未摅叶的亩产二千八百一十八斤，由于摅叶使每亩减产达23.3％。因此打头摅叶，提早收获，会使甘薯产量受到影响。
    甘薯虽然对温度很敏感，但是只要温度在摄氏十度以上，它就不会死，摄氏十六度以上它还能继续生长。过去的试验和群众经验也都证明，甘薯植株甚至遭受轻霜后，薯块仍然会增长。
