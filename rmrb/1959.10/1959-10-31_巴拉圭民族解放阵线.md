    Paraguayan National Liberation Front

    The Paraguayan National Liberation Front was formed in February of this year by Paraguayan exiles in Uruguay. Participants include members of the Liberal Party, the February Party, the Communist Party, democratic elements within the ruling National Republican Association-Colorado Party, and Catholics. Its aim is to lead and promote the Paraguayan people's struggle to overthrow the Stroessner dictatorship and establish a national democratic provisional government.

    According to the Spanish-language magazine "Visión" published in the United States, under the Stroessner dictatorship, 400,000 Paraguayans are living in exile abroad, a figure that accounts for one-quarter of the Paraguayan population. Their main center of residence is Argentina, followed by Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay.

    Due to the establishment of the Paraguayan National Liberation Front, the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorship struggle has been further developed, and various scattered anti-dictatorship forces have begun to unite. Hundreds of anti-dictatorship organizations – Solidarity Committees – have been established in Paraguay itself, Argentina, and Brazil.

    On March 5, the Paraguayan National Liberation Front announced a public notice calling on the people to fight against the dictatorship. The main contents of the notice are: to formulate a democratic constitution that guarantees human rights, guarantees all political parties, trade unions, and people's organizations, guarantees the right to strike, implements land reform, and defends national economic and political independence; to hold free elections, giving all political parties complete democratic freedom and guarantees equally; to give freedom to trade unions, students, farmers, and people's organizations, and to abolish all laws and regulations that suppress democratic freedom; to establish a National Assembly composed of all parties and enjoying freedom and sovereignty; the democratic government will strive to develop industry and agriculture, distribute land to farmers according to law, reduce taxes and prices, and strive to use national wealth for economic development and national progress.

    The formation of the Paraguayan National Liberation Front and the program it released have been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Paraguay. The idea of uniting to fight for freedom and democracy has taken root in the hearts of the people. The main political parties in Paraguay have expressed their willingness to unite and fight to overthrow the dictatorship. Carlos Pastore, a member of the leadership of the Liberal Party, said that he believes that this call not only requires people to unite to overthrow the dictatorship but also lays the foundation for the establishment of a government that implements democratic principles. Rafael Franco, the leader of the Advanced Youth League of the Liberal Party, Orlando Rojas, the leader of the February Party Youth League, and other political figures have expressed their willingness to unite against the dictatorship.

    巴拉圭民族解放阵线
    巴拉圭民族解放阵线是在乌拉圭的巴拉圭流亡者于今年2月间组成的，参加的有自由党、二月党、共产党、执政党国家共和党中的民主分子和天主教徒，其宗旨是领导和推动巴拉圭人民推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁统治和建立全国性的民主临时政府的斗争。
    据美国出版的西班牙文杂志“视界”透露，在斯特罗斯纳独裁统治下，有四十万巴拉圭人流亡国外，这个数字占巴拉圭人口的四分之一。他们最主要的侨居中心是阿根廷，其次是巴西、智利和乌拉圭等国。
    由于巴拉圭民族解放阵线的成立。巴拉圭人民的反独裁斗争得到进一步的发展，各种分散的反独裁力量已经开始联合起来。在巴拉圭本国、阿根廷和巴西等国已建立了几百个反独裁的组织——团结委员会。
    巴拉圭民族解放阵线3月5日宣布一个号召人民反独裁斗争的公告。公告的主要内容是：制定一个保障人权、保障各政党、工会和人民组织，保障罢工权利，实行土地改革，保卫国家经济和政治独立的民主宪法；举行自由选举，同等地给予一切政党完全的民主自由和保障；给工会、学生、农民和人民团体以自由，废除一切镇压民主自由的法律和规定；成立包括一切党派的、享有自由主权的国民议会；民主政府将努力发展工农业，根据法律把土地分给农民，降低税收和物价，争取把全国财富用于经济发展和国家的进步。
    巴拉圭民族解放阵线的组成和它发布的纲领得到了巴拉圭各阶层人民的热烈欢迎。团结起来争自由、争民主的思想已深入人心。巴拉圭各主要政党纷纷表示要团结起来，为推翻独裁政权而斗争。自由党领导机构委员卡洛斯·帕斯托雷说，他认为这一号召不仅要求人们团结起来推翻独裁统治，而且是为成立一个实行民主原则的政府奠定基础。自由党先进青年联盟领袖、二月党领袖拉斐尔·弗朗科、二月党青年领袖奥尔兰多·罗哈斯，以及其他政党人士都表示要团结起来反对独裁政权。
