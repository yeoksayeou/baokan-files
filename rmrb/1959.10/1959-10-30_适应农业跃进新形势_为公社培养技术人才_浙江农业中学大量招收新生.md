    Adapting to the New Situation of the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture: Cultivating Technical Talents for Communes
    Zhejiang Agricultural Middle Schools Enrolling Large Numbers of New Students
    (Reported by this newspaper) To adapt to the new situation of the continuous Great Leap Forward in agriculture and to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification as soon as possible, people's communes in various parts of Zhejiang Province, focusing on production and central tasks, have taken active and effective measures to vigorously establish half-farming, half-study agricultural middle schools to cultivate junior technical talents for the communes and meet the schooling requirements of higher primary school graduates.
    After rectification and consolidation this spring, 872 agricultural middle schools in Zhejiang Province have persisted, with more than 42,000 students, and these schools have had a good impact on the masses. Now agricultural middle schools have developed significantly. According to statistics as of mid-September, more than 25,000 new students have been enrolled, an increase of 35% compared with the number of students at the end of the first half of the year. At present, new students are still being recruited successively. These agricultural middle schools have started classes in September.
    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the development of agricultural middle schools, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously mobilize the masses to run schools. More than 20 cities and counties, including Hangzhou, Shengxian, Linhai, Pinghu, and Haining, have held specialized agricultural middle school conferences to summarize achievements and experiences, unify ideological understanding, and encourage the masses to run agricultural middle schools well. Each county has identified one or two agricultural middle schools as key schools, summarizing school-running and teaching experiences in a timely manner to guide the work of other agricultural middle schools. Most agricultural middle schools are headed by the commune or management district Party committee secretary, who also serves as the principal and political class teacher, regularly giving political reports to teachers and students. Some communes also select Party member cadres to serve as full-time vice-principals.
    All localities, proceeding from the interests of production development and convenient enrollment for the masses, have uniformly arranged the layout of various secondary schools and made appropriate adjustments to the establishment of agricultural middle schools, striving to achieve reasonable distribution. Now there is an average of one and a half agricultural middle schools per commune in the province. Yongkang, Shengxian, and other counties have developed more, averaging more than three per commune, and more than 95% of higher primary school graduates have the opportunity to go to school.
    In the process of continuing to vigorously establish agricultural middle schools, Party committees at all levels have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, relied on the masses, and solved problems such as school buildings, equipment, teachers, and funding. If there are no school buildings, the masses lend their houses to the school. If there is no equipment, teachers and students make it themselves. The funding of general agricultural middle schools is resolved through tuition fees, school production labor, and commune subsidies. At present, a few schools have achieved self-sufficiency in production, and most have achieved partial or semi-self-sufficiency. Since April of this year, Xixi Agricultural Middle School in Shengxian County has achieved self-sufficiency in production. The school's annual agricultural income is 8,571 yuan, its sideline income is 1,277 yuan, and its total income, including previous surpluses, is 10,898 yuan. This year, teacher salaries, student meals, agricultural and sideline production costs, office expenses, book fees, welfare expenses, and public accumulation funds totaled 7,988 yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there is a surplus of about 3,000 yuan.
    Existing agricultural middle schools are equipped with full-time teachers. According to incomplete statistics, there are 1,658 full-time teachers in agricultural middle schools throughout the province, and the newly established agricultural middle schools have added about 500 new teachers. In addition to making full use of existing teachers, the method of solving the teacher problem generally involves selecting qualified candidates from unsuccessful high school and junior high school graduates, transferred cadres, demobilized construction soldiers, and social educated youth, providing them with short-term training, and assigning them to serve as agricultural middle school teachers. The vast majority of these full-time teachers have at least a junior high school education and good political conditions. In Wenling County, 87% of the 85 teachers have a high school education, and only 13% have a junior high school education. Party members and League members account for 54%, and workers and peasants account for 65%. Some counties have also transferred excellent teachers to teach in agricultural middle schools. In order to continuously improve the political and professional level of teachers, the Ningbo Special District has held three agricultural middle school teacher training classes since the summer vacation this year, training 635 teachers. Many places have established a tutoring system for agricultural middle schools by ordinary middle schools. Some counties have established teacher groups based on communes, regularly concentrating on studying lesson preparation, organizing observation and teaching, and exchanging teaching experiences. Agricultural middle school teachers in various places also participate in political study and professional training together with teachers from other schools.
    The teaching activities of agricultural middle schools are all arranged in accordance with the principle of combining education with productive labor. Now the weekly class hours are generally 20 to 24 hours. In order to facilitate the integration of agricultural middle school teaching with production, people's communes in various places have allocated a certain amount of land and production tools to the newly established agricultural middle schools, generally providing each person with half to one mu of land.

    适应农业跃进新形势  为公社培养技术人才
    浙江农业中学大量招收新生
    本报讯　为了适应农业继续跃进的新形势，尽快实现农业机械化和电气化，浙江省各地人民公社围绕生产和中心工作，采取了积极有效措施，大办半耕半读的农业中学，为公社培养初级技术人才，满足高小毕业生的升学要求。
    浙江省农业中学经过今春整顿巩固，坚持下来的有八百七十二所，学生四万二千余人，这些学校在群众中发生良好的影响。现在农业中学又有了较大的发展，截至9月中旬统计，已招收新生二万五千余人，比上半年期末学生数增长35％。目前，新生尚在陆续招收中。这些农业中学已于9月份陆续开学上课。
    各级党委对发展农业中学工作十分重视，坚持政治挂帅，大力发动群众办学。杭州，嵊县、临海、平湖、海宁等二十多个市县召开了农业中学专业会议，总结成绩和经验，统一思想认识，鼓舞群众办好农业中学的信心。各县都确定一、二个农业中学为重点，及时总结办学和教学经验，以便推动指导其他农业中学工作。农业中学大部分都由公社或管理区党委书记兼任校长和政治课教师，定期向师生作政治报告，有的公社还选派党员干部担任专职副校长。
    各地都从有利生产发展、便利群众入学出发，统一安排各类中等学校的布局，对农业中学的设置也作了适当调整，尽可能做到合理分布。现在全省平均每个公社有一个半农业中学。永康、嵊县等县发展较多，平均每个公社已达三所以上，95％以上的高小毕业生都有升学学习机会。
    在继续大办农业中学的过程中，各级党委充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，依靠群众，解决了校舍设备、师资和经费等问题。没有校舍，群众把自己的房子让出来借给学校，没有设备，师生动手制造。一般农业中学的经费都是采取收学费、学校搞生产劳动和公社补助等办法解决，目前已有少数学校实行生产自给，普遍做到部分自给和半自给。嵊县溪西农业中学自今年4月份起已实行生产自给，该校全年农业收入达八千五百七十一元，副业收入一千二百七十七元，加上以前结余等共计收入有一万零八百九十八元，而今年教师工资，学生伙食，农副业成本，办公费、书籍费、福利费，公积金等共支出七千九百八十八元，收支相抵，尚结余三千元左右。
    现有农业中学都配有专职教师，据不完全的统计：全省有农业中学专职教师一千六百五十八人，新办的农业中学共增加约五百名新教师。解决师资的办法，除充分发挥现有师资力量外，一般从投考未录取的高、初中毕业生、下放干部、复员建设军人和社会知识青年中选拔符合条件的加以短期训练，分配担任农业中学教师。这些专职教师绝大部分是初中毕业以上文化程度，政治条件也好，温岭县八十五个教师，高中程度的占87％，初中程度的仅占13％，党团员占54％，工农成份占65％。有些县还抽调了优秀教师到农业中学任教。为了不断提高教师的政治和业务水平，宁波专区今年暑期以来共举办了三次农业中学教师训练班，培养了六百三十五名教师，许多地方建立了普通中学对农业中学的辅导制度，有些县以公社为单位成立了教师组，定期集中研究备课，组织观摩教学，交流教学经验，各地农业中学教师还同其他学校教师一道参加政治学习和业务进修。
    农业中学的教学活动都是遵循着教育与生产劳动相结合的方针安排的，现在每周上课时数一般为二十到二十四小时。各地人民公社为了便于农业中学教学结合生产，给新办农业中学都拨了一定土地和生产工具，一般每人都有半亩至一亩土地。　（罗任达）
