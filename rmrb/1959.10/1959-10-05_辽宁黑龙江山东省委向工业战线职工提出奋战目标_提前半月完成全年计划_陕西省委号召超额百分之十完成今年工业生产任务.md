Xinhua News Agency reports: The CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee issued a new battle cry at a provincial industrial telephone conference held on September 25th: to work with great enthusiasm, achieve a flying start in October, fight hard in the fourth quarter, and strive to complete the annual plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule.
The conference believed that the situation on the industrial front in Liaoning Province is very good.
The conference arranged the work and main product targets for the fourth quarter. Compared with the third quarter, steel and iron targets were increased by 20% and 27% respectively. Regarding the work arrangements for the fourth quarter, the conference required that efforts be made to move forward rather than lag behind, and to comprehensively complete all targets. While grasping production in the fourth quarter, it is necessary to prepare for production in the first quarter of next year; while grasping output, it is necessary to grasp quality, safety, equipment maintenance, and enterprise management, so that the new upsurge of the mass movement to vigorously increase production and practice economy can continue to develop, achieving a leap forward this year and an even greater leap forward next year.

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Harbin, the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee recently held an industrial conference to comprehensively deploy industrial production and construction work for the fourth quarter.
The conference required industrial, forestry, capital construction, and transportation departments throughout the province to conscientiously implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Twelfth Enlarged Session of the Provincial Party Committee, to continue to oppose rightist tendencies and boost enthusiasm, to seize the fourth quarter, to deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, to combine the vigorous mass movement with technical innovation and technical revolution, to combine vigorous and enthusiastic efforts with solid and down-to-earth work, and to strive to complete the annual production plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule, and to prepare for production next year.
To this end, the conference required all localities to do a good job in several aspects: First, continue to oppose rightist tendencies and boost enthusiasm, conscientiously study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Twelfth Enlarged Session of the Provincial Party Committee, and widely publicize the great achievements of the ten years since the founding of the country among workers, to further stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses and lay a solid ideological foundation for deeply developing the movement to increase production and practice economy. Second, all localities and enterprises should summarize the experiences of the vigorous mass movement since August and September, conduct an evaluation and reward work, and continuously guide the movement to in-depth development; at the same time, in conjunction with welcoming the convening of the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers Representatives in industrial, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade socialist construction, the labor competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced should be pushed to a new stage. In the movement, it is necessary to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, promote various advanced experiences, and pay attention to the combination of work and rest. Third, continue to strengthen enterprise management, especially to pay attention to consolidating and improving the experience of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," so that professional management and mass management are closely combined. Fourth, prepare for next year's production to ensure that production in the first quarter of next year is not lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year.

"Complete the annual plan half a month ahead of schedule," this is the current action slogan of the broad masses of workers in Shandong Province. This slogan was put forward to the workers on the basic construction and industrial production front of the province by the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee at the telephone conference on September 24th and 25th.
At these two days of telephone conferences to deploy the battle tasks for the fourth quarter, the Shandong Provincial Committee especially emphasized that it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out the mass movement, continuously and deeply publicize and implement the Party's General Line, criticize various right-leaning thoughts, fully mobilize the masses, and make all workers spirited and striving to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country as soon as possible. In order to push the movement of increasing production and practicing economy to a greater climax, the Provincial Committee requires all local committees and municipal committees to immediately summarize the experience of carrying out the Six Comparisons Red Flag competition in the previous stage, and to select pace-setters in the province as soon as possible, raise the advanced banner high, so that the broad masses of workers "have content to learn, have goals to catch up with, and have directions to surpass," setting off a heat wave of competition of "learning, catching up, and surpassing."
The telephone conference emphasized the need to vigorously grasp technical revolution and technical innovation, and take this as the central content of organizing the competition. The Provincial Committee requires that leading departments at all levels and all provincial departments and bureaus should set up institutions to manage technical innovation work, lead the technical innovation movement, study and deal with workers' rationalization proposals, and promote them rapidly. The Provincial Committee also pointed out that all production units should strengthen enterprise management well, effectively do a good job in production scheduling, and do a good job in production organization. Cadres of party committees at all levels and leading organs at all levels should often go deep into workshops and construction sites to check and help with work. The Provincial Committee plans to organize a major production inspection in October, led by provincial and municipal responsible comrades, to go deep into factories and mines to check and help with work.
When deploying basic construction tasks, the Shandong Provincial Committee emphasized that in the fourth quarter, it is necessary to grasp key points, grasp progress, grasp equipment and materials work, grasp safe production, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and improve labor productivity. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's unified leadership over the construction site, carry forward the spirit of communist cooperation, and work together to strive to complete basic construction tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee convened a telephone conference on the evening of September 28th, calling on workers on the industrial front of the province to continue to deeply oppose right-leaning, boost enthusiasm, carry out a high-yield, high-quality, low-cost movement to increase production and practice economy, and comprehensively complete this year's industrial production plan exceeding the target by 10%.
Wang Lin, Secretary of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee, spoke at the meeting. Comrade Wang Lin pointed out that October is a crucial month to complete the production plan for the fourth quarter, and all preparations must be made to ensure that production is in full swing after the holiday, so that the production level in October will not only not be lower than that in September, but will greatly exceed it.
Comrade Wang Lin pointed out that the current situation on the industrial production front in the province is very good, and as long as we adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carry out the mass movement, we are confident of comprehensively completing the annual industrial production plan exceeding the target by 10%. In order to complete this year's production plan exceeding the target, leading cadres at all levels of factories and mining enterprises should go to the forefront of production, continue to deeply criticize the right-leaning emotions of some cadres, deeply mobilize the masses, and conscientiously solve various problems in production. In vigorously carrying out the mass movement, we should vigorously promote various effective advanced experiences, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, guide the masses' full revolutionary enthusiasm to clever work, and closely combine hard work, practical work, and clever work.
