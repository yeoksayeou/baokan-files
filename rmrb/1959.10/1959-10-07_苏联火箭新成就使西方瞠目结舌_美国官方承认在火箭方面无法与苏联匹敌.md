Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The brilliant achievement of the Soviet Union in successfully launching its third cosmic rocket continues to be the focus of attention for Western newspapers and the scientific community.

    The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote in an editorial: "The Soviet Union sending a rocket to the moon was already an astounding achievement. But the 'third cosmic rocket' now flying towards the moon is an even more complex and difficult endeavor - a true launch into the unknown. ...This effort offers enormous possibilities for increasing mankind's knowledge of space."

    The American ruling group showed great panic in the face of the Soviet Union's new scientific achievements. After the news of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket was released, Dr. York, Director of Defense Research and Engineering at the U.S. Department of Defense, hastily convened a press conference in an attempt to downplay the significance of the Soviet Union's new achievement. In his speech, he had to admit that the United States simply could not match the Soviet Union in terms of rocket thrust and satellite weight, and that the American people should be fully prepared to see more and heavier Soviet artificial celestial bodies in the future. However, on the other hand, he self-deprecatingly said that this did not mean that the United States was lagging behind in intercontinental missiles. He wanted the American people not to take the Soviet Union's "space victory" too "seriously."

    Many American newspapers, while acknowledging the Soviet Union's lead in space exploration, also tried their best to promote the further development of rocket technology in the United States, and especially emphasized the military significance of doing so.

    British newspapers unanimously pointed out that the latest achievement of Soviet scientists has brought mankind much closer to the goal of conquering the universe. London's "Daily Express" believes that the launch of the third Soviet cosmic rocket is "another brilliant achievement of Soviet space scientists."

     The "Daily Telegraph" wrote: "By successfully launching its third cosmic rocket, 'Soviet scientists have already won another first prize in space research.'"

    Parisian newspapers believe that this new achievement of Soviet science is a decisive step towards conquering outer space.

    "L'Aurore" wrote that this was "a major step for mankind in conquering outer space," with the Soviets accomplishing a feat that the Americans had dreamed of.

    "L'Humanité" wrote: The Soviet automatic interplanetary station "is clearing the way for future spaceships," and "the door to outer space is now open to mankind."

    Professor Ananoff, President of the French Astronautical Society, said: "We can now say that the road to the universe is truly open."

    West Germany's "Die Welt" pointed out that after successfully launching a rocket to the moon, and then launching a space station, this shows that "the Soviets are advancing step by step to realize their well-organized space exploration plan." The newspaper emphasized that, technically speaking, the launch of a rocket orbiting the moon "pales all previous achievements." "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" said in a commentary: "In view of the Soviet Union's achievements in space flight, one cannot help but conclude that the United States is currently far behind in the space rocket race between the great powers." The newspaper pointed out that in the United States, what needs to be done now is how to make rockets leave the earth and enter orbit with a certain degree of certainty, while the Soviet Union "is already in the stage of planned conquest of the universe."

### 苏联火箭新成就使西方瞠目结舌  美国官方承认在火箭方面无法与苏联匹敌

    苏联火箭新成就使西方瞠目结舌
    美国官方承认在火箭方面无法与苏联匹敌
    新华社6日讯　苏联成功发射第三支宇宙火箭的光辉成就仍然是西方各国报纸和科学界注意的中心。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在社论中写道：“苏联把火箭送上月球就已经是一次非常惊人的成就。但是目前正在飞向月球的‘第三支宇宙火箭’却是一次更加复杂和困难的努力——一次真正向着未知之境的发射。……这次努力提供了增进人类关于空间知识的巨大可能性。”
    美国统治集团在苏联科学的新成就面前表现得十分惊慌。美国国防部国防研究与工程室主任约克博士在苏联第三支宇宙火箭上天的消息传出后匆忙召开了一次记者招待会，妄图贬低苏联新成就的意义。他在发言中不得不承认在火箭的推力和卫星的重量等方面美国目前根本无法同苏联匹敌，并且认为美国人民应作充分思想准备在今后若干年内看到更多更重的苏联人造天体上天。但是另一方面，他又自我解嘲地说，这并不表示美国在洲际导弹方面落后。他要美国人民对苏联的“空间胜利”不必看得过分“严重”。
    不少美国报纸在承认苏联在空间摸索方面领先的同时，还竭力鼓吹美国应进一步发展火箭技术，并且特别强调这样做的军事意义。
    英国报纸一致指出，苏联科学家的最新成就使人类大大接近了征服宇宙的目标。伦敦“每日快报”认为，第三支苏联宇宙火箭上天是“苏联空间科学家的又一次光辉成就”。
      “每日电讯报”写道：由于成功发射第三支宇宙火箭，“苏联科学家已经在空间研究方面又夺取了另一个第一奖”。
    巴黎报纸认为，苏联科学的这个新成就，是向征服宇宙空间跨出的决定性的一步。
    “震旦报”写道，这是“人类在征服宇宙空间方面的一个重大步骤”，苏联人完成了美国人曾经梦想过的业绩。
    “人道报”写道：苏联的自动行星际站“正在替未来的宇宙飞船廓清道路”，“通向外层空间的大门现在已经向人类敞开”。
    法国星际航行协会主席安纳诺夫教授说：“我们现在可以说，通向宇宙的道路是真正打开了。”
    西德的“世界报”指出，在成功发射到达月球的火箭之后，接着又发射空间站，这表明“苏联人正在一步步地前进，实现他们那组织得很良好的空间探索计划”。这家报纸强调说，从技术上说，发射围绕月球的火箭“使以往已经取得的全部成就都黯然失色”。“法兰克福汇报”在一篇评论中说：“鉴于苏联在宇宙飞行方面的成就，人们不得不断定：在大国的宇宙火箭竞赛中，美国目前是远远落在后面了。”这家报纸指出，在美国，现在要作的是怎样设法使火箭有一定程度的把握离开地球和进入轨道，而苏联则“已经处在有计划征服宇宙的阶段了”。
