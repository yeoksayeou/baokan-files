Xinhua News Agency, 29th -- The National "Gathering of Heroes" continued its plenary session speeches today. The speeches of representatives from various regions vividly reflect the great development of the communist spirit of China's working class, with a large number of moving examples of common improvement and common leaps forward emerging.

    Many of the representatives who spoke today were well-known innovators who dared to think and act. Wei Gaohou, a milling worker from Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, reported to the conference that in the two hundred and seventy-odd days from January to September this year, he had already implemented four hundred and seventy-two innovation proposals, solving sixty-seven key production problems, with the highest increase in work efficiency reaching more than twenty thousand times. This ordinary worker, full of revolutionary initiative, completed almost two technical innovations every day. Wei Gaohou said that he also encountered many difficulties in the process of technological innovation. Sometimes an innovation failed dozens of times, but thanks to the constant reliance on the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, he finally succeeded. He said: "Difficulties fear drive, perseverance leads to victory."

    Su Guangming, a milling worker from Harbin Rolling Stock Factory and a pacesetter on the industrial front in Harbin, excitedly reported to the conference that he is now doing the work of 1970. In the next two months, he guarantees to carry out fifteen more technological innovations, complete nine months of work, and enter 1971 ahead of schedule. This old hero who is ahead of time has learned and applied more than forty kinds of advanced experiences from home and abroad in recent years, and has realized more than one hundred major technological innovations, increasing production efficiency by one to twenty times respectively. Ma Xueli, an adjustment worker from Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, has put forward more than three hundred and forty technical innovation proposals this year. After the "external whirlwind milling" he created last year increased work efficiency by ten to twelve times, many people believed that it was impossible to increase work efficiency any further. However, in February this year, Ma Xueli successfully created the "reciprocating stroke cutting method," which further increased work efficiency by fourteen to sixteen times. Ma Xueli emphasized that under any equipment and technical conditions, production potential is always endless, and technical innovation never ends.

    Thousands of advanced producers not only lead the way themselves but also actively help others catch up with them. Many representatives pointed out in their speeches: "There should be no backwardness next to the advanced, and helping others is our duty." Tian Jingqi, a lathe worker from the tool workshop of Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, is a man full of communist spirit who goes wherever he is needed to help. Tian Jingqi not only completed six years and nine months of work in twenty months, but also helped some workers in his team solve ideological problems and master advanced technologies, so that the team has overfulfilled its production tasks every month since May last year, and all twenty-four members of the team have completed their 1960 workload ahead of schedule in September this year. Tian Jingqi and some employees also organized a "Three-Combination Red Flag Service Team" to actively send advanced experience to other workshops. In March this year, as a representative of the National People's Congress, Tian Jingqi and other people's representatives went to other places to inspect work and helped a machinery factory in Lezhi County improve work efficiency. In August this year, he participated in the Chengdu Municipal Second Quarter Labor Competition Summary and Award Ceremony, and used his rest time to go to an electric motor factory six times to carry out innovations, helping the factory to summarize and promote advanced experience. Tian Jingqi guaranteed at the meeting today: "In the fourth quarter of this year, we will also help two teams reach advanced levels; whenever our 'Three-Combination Red Flag Service Team' is needed in this factory or other factories, we guarantee to respond to every request." Yao Xin'gen, captain of the cofferdam brigade of the Fuchun River Hydropower Bureau in Zhejiang Province, was sent to the Xijin Hydropower Station in Guangxi in June this year to support the restoration of the cofferdam project. When he arrived at the construction site, the cofferdam had been breached by floods, and the torrents were very dangerous at that time. Worried that others would be swept away by the floods if they went into the water, Yao Xin'gen risked his life and jumped into the water to understand the situation. Later, under the leadership of the local Party committee, he worked with engineers, technicians, and workers to study and help them come up with a method to stop the torrents and repair the cofferdam. Yao Xin'gen said in his speech today: We will go wherever we are needed, and as long as it is beneficial to socialist construction, we must go all out.

    The upsurge of competition to catch up with the advanced and the spirit of communist cooperation are expanding in an increasingly broad range. Wang Jiong, head of the Beijing Municipal Delegation attending the conference, and Liu Guohua, a representative from the Third Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, vividly described this situation in their speeches today.

    Since the beginning of this year, the million workers in Beijing have overfulfilled the total industrial output value plan every month. From January to September, the city's total industrial output value increased by 91% compared with the same period last year, and more than ninety factories and enterprises have completed the national plan for this year ahead of schedule. Wang Jiong said that the communist spirit of mutual support, mutual cooperation, common improvement, and common leap forward among the city's workers in the competition has played a huge role in the continued leap forward this year. Many technologically advanced large enterprises actively support small enterprises with backward technology and equipment, and many advanced workers enthusiastically help others, so that the backward can quickly improve. In the upsurge of competition to learn from pacesetters, catch up with pacesetters, and strive to enter 1960 ahead of schedule, more than 8,400 young workers and more than 700 advanced collectives (including more than 20,000 people) in the city had completed this year's tasks ahead of schedule by October 23. Liu Guohua introduced at the meeting that, due to the universal development of the communist spirit of mutual assistance among workers, the Third Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel has widely carried out technical performance competitions this year, in which they learn from each other and help each other in technology. Regardless of young workers and old workers, advanced producers and temporarily backward workers, leading cadres and technicians, all actively participated, and the whole plant formed a competitive upsurge in which everyone strived to be upstream, chased after each other, and improved together. Since they launched the technical performance competition in May this year, the daily output of steel in the entire plant has increased from 2,701 tons in January-April to 4,008 tons in September, and the quality, variety, and cost plans of steel have been completed better than in the past.

    "Our hardship is for the happiness of millions of people." Liu Jinmei, a young female technician who is determined to devote her life to geological exploration, and Guo Shixing, director of the Dadeng Island Postal and Telecommunications Branch from the frontline of coastal defense in Fujian, introduced their deeds of adhering to their posts and working hard at the meeting today, which were full of the heroic spirit of the working class being selfless and forgetting themselves.

    In the past three years, Liu Jinmei and her comrades in the geological team have traveled more than 14,000 li in the deep mountains and forests, inspecting 66 ore points and finding iron, copper, lead, and other mineral resources for the country; in the Great Leap Forward last year, they found boron mines that the country urgently needed for industrial construction. She said: Our geological workers fight in high mountains and deep valleys all year round, eating and sleeping in the open air. Every time we set out to work, we have to carry more than 20 kilograms of stone specimens and walk 70 or 80 li of muddy and slippery mountain roads. Our lives are indeed hard. However, every time we think that our hardship is precisely for the happiness of millions of people, we immediately have the confidence and strength to overcome difficulties. Guo Shixing introduced that in order to ensure the smooth flow of postal and telecommunications lines, the postal and telecommunications workers on Dadeng Island often risked the enemy's artillery fire to quickly connect the broken telephone lines and deliver letters and telegrams to the recipients. Once, Guo Shixing was delivering a letter when he suddenly heard the hissing sound of shells. He immediately turned around and lay down, pressing his chest against the mailbag, protecting it like his own life. Guo Shixing said: No enemy can stop us from moving forward, and no enemy can stop the leap forward in our country's construction.

    At today's meeting, Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen and Chairman of the National Women's Federation Cai Chang gave speeches entitled "Go All Out and Strive for the Continued Leap Forward of Science and Technology" and "Female Workers Should Become More Advanced Producers," respectively. A news reporting team composed of 900 workers from Beijing, holding hundreds of red flags and many news reporting boards, entered the venue in eight routes during the meeting to report the latest achievements in Beijing's industrial production, capital construction, and financial and trade fronts. All the representatives expressed their congratulations on the brilliant achievements of Beijing's workers with prolonged applause.

    Also speaking at today's meeting were Liu Qingshan, leader of the electroplate group of Nanning People's Printing Plant in Guangxi, Zhang Qinglan, a representative from Haotang Coal Mine in Pingdingshan, Henan, Ma Yongshun, leader of the logging team of Tieli Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang, Ahe Niyazi, captain of the tunneling team of Liudaowan Coal Mine in Xinjiang, Li Shule, a representative from Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine in Kailuan Coal Mine, and Wang Huofu, a representative from Licheng County, Shanxi Province.

    The conference will continue tomorrow.

    群英会上畅谈共同跃进范例
    英雄左右皆好汉
    聂荣臻蔡畅先后在会上讲了话
    新华社29日讯　全国“群英会”今天继续大会发言。各地代表的发言，生动地反映出我国工人阶级的共产主义风格大大发扬，共同提高共同跃进的动人事例大量涌现。
    今天发言的代表有不少是敢想敢干的著名革新能手。重庆长安机器厂铣工魏高厚向大会报告说，在今年1到9月的二百七十多天中，他已经实现了四百七十二件革新建议，解决生产关键问题的有六十七件，提高工效最高的达到两万多倍。这位充满革命首创精神的普通工人，差不多每天就完成了两件技术革新。魏高厚说，他在革新技术的过程中也碰到过许多困难，有时一个革新往往失败几十次，但是由于始终依靠党的领导和群众支持，终于获得成功。他说：“困难怕干劲，坚持到底就是胜利。”
    哈尔滨市工业战线上的标兵——哈尔滨车辆厂铣工苏广铭兴奋地向大会报捷说，现在他已经在干着1970年的活了。今后两个月中，他保证还要再搞技术革新十五项，完成九个月的工作量，提早跨入1971年。这位走在时间前面的老英雄几年来已经学习和运用了国内外先进经验四十多种，实现了一百多项较大的技术革新，分别把生产效率提高一倍到二十倍。武汉重型机床厂调整工马学礼，今年以来已经提出了三百四十多项技术革新建议。他去年创造的“外旋风铣”把工作效率提高了十至十二倍以后，不少人认为工效再不可能提高了，可是，马学礼今年2月又创造成功了“往返行程吃刀法”，把工效再提高十四到十六倍。马学礼强调说：在任何设备和技术条件下，生产潜力永远无穷无尽，技术革新永无止境。
    千万个先进生产者不仅自己走在时间前面，并且积极帮助别人赶上自己。不少代表在发言中指出：“先进旁边不应该有落后，帮助别人是我们的义务。”成都量具刃具厂工具车间车工田景琦就是一位走到那里帮到那里的充满共产主义精神的人物。田景琦不仅自己在二十个月中完成了六年零九个月的工作量，而且帮助本小组中有些工人解决思想问题，掌握先进技术，使小组从去年5月份起月月超额完成生产任务，全组二十四人都在今年9月份提前完成了1960年的工作量。田景琦还和一些职工组织了一个“三结合红旗服务队”，给其他车间主动送去先进经验。今年3月，作为全国人民代表的田景琦和其他人民代表一起到外地视察工作，又帮助乐至县一个机械厂提高了工效。今年8月他参加成都市第二季度劳动竞赛总结评比发奖大会，又利用休息时间六次去一家电动机厂搞革新，帮助这个厂总结和推广先进经验。田景琦今天在大会上保证说：“今年第四季度我还要帮助两个小组达到先进水平；本厂或外厂任何时候需要我们‘三结合红旗服务队’，我们保证有求必应。”浙江省富春江水力发电局围堰大队队长姚新根，今年6月被派到广西西津水电站支援修复围堰工程。到了工地，围堰已被洪水冲破，当时激流滚滚，情况十分危急。姚新根担心别人下水会被洪水卷走，他就冒着生命危险，跳下水去了解情况。后来，他又在当地党委的领导下，同工程师、技术员、工人一起研究，帮助那里想出了制止急流修复围堰的办法。姚新根今天在发言中说：那里需要就到那里，只要对社会主义建设有利，我们都要鼓足干劲去干。
    赶先进的竞赛热潮和共产主义的大协作之风，正在越来越广阔的范围内扩展开来。出席大会的北京市代表团团长王炯和鞍钢第三炼钢厂代表刘国华，今天在发言中生动地描述了这方面的情况。
    北京市百万职工今年以来月月超额完成工业总产值计划，1至9月份全市工业总产值比去年同期增长了91％，九十多个工厂企业已提前完成今年国家计划。王炯说，全市职工在竞赛中互相支援、互相协作、共同提高、共同跃进的共产主义精神，对今年的继续跃进起了巨大作用。许多技术先进的大型企业积极支援技术设备落后的小企业，许多先进工人热情帮助别人，使落后者迅速提高。在学标兵、赶标兵、争取提前跨入1960年的竞赛热潮中，全市到10月23日已有八千四百多名青年工人和七百多个先进集体（包括两万多人），提前完成了今年的任务。刘国华在会上介绍说，由于职工群众共产主义互助精神的普遍发扬，鞍钢第三炼钢厂今年广泛开展了在技术上互相学习，互相帮助的技术表演赛。不论青年工人和老工人、先进生产者和暂时落后的工人、领导干部和技术人员，都踊跃参加，全厂形成了人人力争上游、你追我赶、共同提高的竞赛热潮。他们从今年5月份开展技术表演竞赛以来，全厂钢的日产量已经由1至4月的二千七百零一吨上升到9月份的四千零八吨，钢的质量、品种、成本计划都比过去完成得更好。
    “我们的艰苦是为了千百万人的幸福”。立志把终身献给地质勘探事业的青年女技术员刘金美和来自福建海防前线的大嶝岛邮电支局局长郭诗杏，今天在会上介绍的他们坚守岗位艰苦奋斗的事迹，充满了工人阶级公而忘私的英雄气概。
    刘金美三年来曾经同她所在的地质队的同志一起，在深山密林中跋涉一万四千多华里，检查矿点六十六个，为国家找出铁、铜、铅等矿源；在去年大跃进中，他们又给国家找到了工业建设迫切需要的硼矿。她说：我们地质工作者整年战斗在高山深谷，餐风宿露，每次出发工作要背上二十多斤的石头标本，走七、八十里泥泞陡滑的山路。我们的生活的确是苦。但是，每当我们想到自己的艰苦正是为了千百万人的幸福，我们就立刻有了克服困难的信心和力量。郭诗杏介绍说，大嶝岛邮电职工为了保证邮电线路畅通，常常冒着敌人的炮火，迅速地把被打断的电话线路连接起来，把信件和电报送到收件人手里。有一次，郭诗杏正在送信，突然听到嘶嘶的炮弹声，他立刻转身卧倒，把前胸俯贴在信袋上，像保护自己的生命一样保护它。郭诗杏说：任何敌人也阻挡不住我们前进的脚步，阻挡不住我国建设事业的飞跃发展。
    在今天的大会上，国务院副总理聂荣臻、全国妇联主席蔡畅，先后以“鼓足干劲，为科学技术的继续跃进而奋斗”、“女职工同志们要更多地成为先进生产者”为题讲了话。北京市九百名职工组成的报喜队，在大会进行中高举着数百面红旗和许多报喜牌，分八路进入会场，向大会报告北京市工业生产、基本建设、财贸战线上的最新成就。全体代表以经久不息的掌声，对北京市工人的光辉成绩表示祝贺。
    在今天大会上发言的，还有广西南宁人民印刷厂电版组长刘青山，河南平顶山郝堂煤矿代表张清兰，黑龙江铁力林业局伐木组长马永顺，新疆六道湾煤矿掘进队长阿合尼牙孜，开滦煤矿唐家庄矿代表李书乐，山西省黎城县代表王火福。
    明天，大会将继续举行。
