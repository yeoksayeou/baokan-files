Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: Since the start of the anti-rightist campaign and the encouragement of greater effort, the workers of Liaoning Province have achieved comprehensive victories in production, attaining a series of significant accomplishments. First, the rate of production increase is even greater. The total industrial output value in August increased by 12% compared to July, and in September it increased by another 18.8% compared to August, setting a new record for the highest monthly growth rate of total industrial output value in the province. The output of major products such as steel, iron, steel products, coal, cement, and machinery has also increased significantly. Compared to July, the average daily output of steel in September increased by 15.6%, pig iron by 14.5%, and steel products by 23.7%; for example, if the daily output of steel products in early August is taken as 100, it had risen to 135.7 by late September. Other products such as crude oil, electricity generation, metal cutting machine tools, machine-made paper, and daily industrial goods also saw substantial increases.

This new upsurge in the campaign for increased production and thrift is not only reflected in high output, but also in high quality, low consumption, safety, and production preparation. The quality of many industrial products has improved significantly compared to the past. In September, the quality of 44 out of 72 major products exceeded past levels. The ash content of coal in Fushun, the "Coal Capital," decreased by another 0.84% in September compared to August. The qualified rate of pig iron produced by the "Dongfeng" and other two large blast furnaces in Benxi increased from 99.45% in August to 99.79% in September. The qualified rate of open-hearth steel in Anshan, the "Steel Capital," reached a new level in September, increasing by 0.69% compared to August. The labor productivity of workers has also been increasing steadily, rising by 15.2% in August compared to July, and by another 21.3% in September compared to August. As a result of increased labor productivity and reduced costs and consumption, the profits turned over to the state by industrial enterprises throughout the province increased by 56.9% in August compared to July, and in September exceeded the state plan, accumulating more than 56 million yuan in funds for the state.

In August and September, all sectors exceeded their plans every ten days, changing the previous situation where the production level at the beginning of the month was lower than at the end of the previous month. Looking at the steel industry alone, the province's steel output in the first ten days of September increased by 4.8% compared to the last ten days of August, and pig iron increased by 2.2%. At the beginning of October, during the National Day holiday celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, they also achieved a good start. From October 1st to 5th, Anshan Iron and Steel's daily steel output increased by 4.3% compared to late September, and pig iron and steel products also exceeded their plans. Other industries have also completed their plans very well since October, creating a good start for a red month and a red quarter.

The Party's great call for anti-rightism, boosting morale, and practicing increased production and thrift has become a huge driving force for the more than one million workers in Liaoning Province to work together to create a good industrial situation. Encouraged by the Party's call, all industrial fronts in the province have launched a vigorous competition with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping forward. The steel army, led by Anshan Iron and Steel, took the lead in proposing to exceed the annual steel production plan by about 10%, challenging the coal miners and railway transport workers to a competition. The more than 200,000 coal miners in the province immediately responded with great enthusiasm, guaranteeing to increase coal production by 2 million tons by the end of the year to meet the needs of the steel industry and other industrial sectors. The workers on the machinery industry front also refused to be outdone, guaranteeing to provide mechanical equipment in terms of quality, quantity, and on time, in order to prepare for the great leap forward in various industrial sectors. The railway transport workers throughout the province were full of fighting spirit, guaranteeing to transport as much as was needed, and to transport out as much as was produced. In this way, a socialist great competition with steel as the key link and a comprehensive leap forward quickly spread to every corner. The breadth of participation in the competition, the variety of competition forms, the richness of content, and the speed of results have all reached unprecedented heights. More than 90% of the workers in the province have joined the competition, and even some engineering and technical personnel who previously stood outside the competition have also joined the movement. Inter-workshop, inter-department, inter-group, and inter-team competitions among workers of the same type of work, competitions between well-matched opponents, competitions for advanced pacesetters, competitions to overcome difficulties and break through key points, one-stop competitions to strengthen cooperation, and technical performance competitions for everyone and everything are intertwined, cooperate with each other, complement each other, and constantly eliminate the backwardness and weak links in the process of production development. In a short month of competition, workers in factories and mines throughout the province put forward more than 340,000 innovation proposals to promote production development, and quickly implemented more than 160,000 of them. In the first half of September, more than 50 factories in Shenyang broke the new quota 38,000 times, and reports of units exceeding and completing their plans ahead of schedule were frequently reported.

　　增产节约号召成为巨大动力
    辽宁工业生产全线猛进
    百万职工齐心协力开展轰轰烈烈的竞赛
    据新华社沈阳14日电　辽宁省全省职工在反右倾、鼓干劲以来，生产全面告捷，获得一系列巨大成就。首先是生产跃进的幅度更大。8月份工业总产值比7月份增长12％，9月份又比8月份增长18.8％，创造了全省月度工业总产值增长速度最高的新纪录。钢、铁、钢材、煤炭、水泥、机械等主要产品产量，也都有很大增长。9月份同7月份相比，钢的平均日产量增长15.6％，生铁增长14.5％，钢材增长23.7％；如以8月上旬钢材日产量为一百，到9月下旬已经上升到一百三十五点七。其他如原油、发电量、金属切削机床、机制纸、日用工业品等，增长幅度也很大。
    这次增产节约运动的新高潮，不仅表现在高产上，而且表现到优质、低耗、安全和生产准备上。许多工业品的质量，都比过去有显著提高。9月份七十二种主要产品中，有四十四种的质量都超过了过去。煤都抚顺的煤炭含灰份，9月份又比8月份降低0.84％。本溪的“东风”号等两座大型高炉，9月份生产的生铁合格率，从8月份的99.45％提高到99.79％。钢都鞍山的平炉钢合格率9月份更上一层楼，比8月提高0.69％。职工的劳动生产率也节节上升，8月份比7月份提高15.2％，9月又比8月提高21.3％。提高劳动生产率、降低成本和消耗的结果，全省工业企业上缴的利润，8月份比7月份增加了56.9％，9月份又超过国家计划，为国家多积累五千六百多万元的资金。
    8、9两月，各行各业，旬旬都超额完成计划，改变了以往月初生产水平比上月末低的状况。仅从钢铁工业看，全省的钢产量9月上旬就比8月下旬提高了4.8％，生铁提高了2.2％。10月初，在庆祝建国十周年的假期，又夺得了开门红。鞍钢1日到5日钢的日产量，比9月下旬提高了4.3％，生铁和钢材也都超额完成计划。其他工业，10月以来计划也完成得很出色，为全月红、全季红创造了良好的开端。
    党的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的伟大号召，成为辽宁省百多万职工齐心协力创造大好工业形势的巨大的动力。在党的号召鼓舞下，全省各条工业战线以万马奔腾之势，掀起了轰轰烈烈的竞赛热潮。以鞍钢为首的钢铁大军一马当先，提出超额10％左右完成全年钢铁生产计划，向煤矿职工和铁路运输职工挑战竞赛。全省二十多万煤矿工人干劲冲天地立即应战，保证到年底增产二百万吨煤炭，满足钢铁工业和其他工业部门的需要。机械工业战线的职工也不示弱，保证按质、按量、按时地提供机械装备，为各工业部门大跃进利戈备马。全省铁路运输职工斗志昂扬，他们保证需要多少运进多少，生产多少，运出多少。这样，一个以钢为纲全面跃进的社会主义大竞赛迅速扩及到各个角落。参加竞赛运动人员之广，竞赛形式之多，内容之丰富，收效之快，都达到了空前高涨的程度。全省90％以上的职工投入了竞赛运动，连以往站在竞赛圈外的有些工程技术人员，也都投入到运动中来。车间与车间，科室与科室，小组与小组，班与班的同工种、同业务竞赛，门当户对的对手赛，力争上游的标兵赛，攻克困难，突破关键的关键赛，加强协作的一条龙赛，人人事事技术表演赛，纵横交错，互相配合，互相补充，不断地消除着生产发展过程中的落后和薄弱环节。在短短一个月的竞赛中，全省各厂矿企业职工提出了三十四万多条推动生产发展的革新建议，很快地实现了十六万多件。沈阳市有五十多个工厂在9月上半月突破新定额三万八千次，各单位超额和提前完成计划的捷报频传。
