　　Multi-headed Sorghum Has High Yields
    The multi-headed sorghum in the experimental plot of the eighth production team of the Bocun Management Area of the Gaodu Commune in Jincheng, Shanxi, had as many as nine heads and at least five heads. After separate harvesting and threshing, this mu of sorghum yielded more than 3,333 jin. The commune members praised this variety as good and with high yields.
    The high-yield record of the experimental plot greatly encouraged everyone. The management area decided to expand the planting of this sorghum by 210 mu next year.
