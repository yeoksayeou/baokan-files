    Green mountains upon green mountains in the oil region,
    Clear streams winding,
    Green bamboo sheltering,
    Drill towers pierce the white clouds.
    Morning songs greet the rosy dawn, ascend the drill tower.
    Morning mist fills the platform, white clouds fly beneath our feet.
    Every white cloud smells of petroleum, every white cloud reflects the colorful glow.
    White clouds, ah! Fly faster!
    Fly over the Ba Mountains, through the Wu Gorge.
    Take our good news to Beijing city, tell Chairman Mao:
    Our oil wells are bursting with petroleum flowers!
    Derrick installation workers are clever, skillful, and agile as apes.
    Coming from the clouds, going into the mist, building steel beams among the colorful clouds.
    Leap forward momentum like a rainbow, joyous songs resound through the sky.
    How many heroic miracles emerge from our hands.
    In the morning, it's still a bare drilling site, by evening, the drill tower stands tall in the blue sky.
    Surpassing Lu Ban, envied by the immortals.

    川中油区之歌
    矿区叠叠群山翠，弯弯溪水清，绿竹掩映处，钻塔入白云。
    晨歌迎朝霞，上钻塔。晨雾满平台，白云飞脚下。朵朵白云石油香，朵朵白云映彩霞。白云啊！你快些儿飞吧！飞度巴山，穿过巫峡。把我们的捷报带到北京城，告诉毛主席：我们的油井，怒放石油花！井架安装工心儿灵，手儿巧，身儿捷似猿。云里来，雾里去，把根根钢梁架在彩云间。跃进气势如虹，欢乐歌声响澈天。多少英雄奇迹，从我们手里出现。清晨，还是光秃的井场，傍晚，钻塔已高耸蓝天。赛过鲁班，羡煞神仙。
