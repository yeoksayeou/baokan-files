    Resolutely Struggle Against Right-leaning Opportunist Thought
    Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    To resolutely implement the Party's General Line, we must wage a tenacious struggle against all forms of opportunism. In the history of the Party, during the Second Revolutionary Civil War period, there were three "Left" leaning opportunist erroneous lines in our Party, especially the Wang Ming line from 1931 to 1934, which caused the most serious damage to the revolution. If the main danger at that time was "Left" leaning opportunism, then the main danger during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction is "Right" leaning opportunism. Of course, there are also some "Left" leaning sentiments or "Left" leaning thoughts, but these are easy to overcome, because the overall leadership is correct. The "Left" errors that occur in some individual places and among some comrades under the correct leadership generally belong to issues of understanding. They still want revolution; their starting point is to do things well; their shortcoming lies in the "Left" leaning one-sidedness of their methods of looking at problems. As long as the reasons are explained clearly to them, it is easy to change them. Right-leaning opportunism, on the other hand, belongs to the issue of standpoint; it involves class alien elements or speculators who have infiltrated the Party. They are the spokespersons of the bourgeoisie within the Party. They seize every opportunity to stir up trouble and coordinate with enemies at home and abroad to attack the Party. Therefore, this is the main danger and long-term danger within the Party.
    Some people believe that Right-leaning opportunism comes from "above," from "outside," and has nothing to do with them, as if the leadership there is very correct. This understanding is wrong. As long as classes exist, as long as the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie has not been completely eliminated, Right-leaning opportunist thought will always exist. Moreover, the facts fully prove that Right-leaning opportunist thought exists not only in economic work departments but also in cultural and educational departments. It exists in all departments and all regions, in senior leadership organs, and it will certainly exist in grass-roots units, only differing in degree and form of expression. People who hold this view only prove that their Right-leaning thought is serious. To turn a blind eye to Right-leaning opportunism and to be politically paralyzed, isn't that Right-leaning?
    Some people believe that as long as there is peaceful education and no struggle, the Party's General Line can be implemented. This is also incorrect. The concrete realization of the General Line will never be achieved peacefully. Facts have repeatedly told us that as long as we earnestly implement the General Line, Right-leaning opportunists will inevitably launch frenzied attacks. The so-called "the devil rises one foot for every ten feet the Dao rises" is the reason. This is because it is a reflection of class struggle, a reflection of the life-and-death struggle between the two antagonistic classes of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Comrade Mao Zedong, in the editor's note to an article in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside," called Right-leaning disease a "Right-leaning stubborn disease," which shows that this disease is stubborn and deep-rooted. It cannot be cured once and for all, nor can it be effective by relying solely on education and persuasion. Serious struggle must be carried out to repel their attacks. To struggle against Right-leaning opportunists, one must have courage and drive. If one is content to be in the middle, of course, there is no question of struggle. We must understand that the correct line and the wrong line cannot coexist; it is either this or that. If we do not mobilize the entire Party and all the people to fight against Right-leaning opportunists and overcome the danger of Right-leaning opportunism, the Party's correct line cannot be resolutely implemented. The situation in Anhui over the past decade proves that earnestly overcoming Right-leaning opportunist thought is an indispensable struggle to defend the General Line.
    To resolutely and comprehensively implement the Party's General Line and strive for greater victories, we must further overcome Right-leaning opportunist thought. This is a very arduous task. Judging from the experience of these past few years, the struggle against Right-leaning opportunist thought must tightly grasp the four characters: "Resist," "Refute," "Expose," and "Rectify."
    "Resist" means to brace oneself and resist the evil wind. Whenever a new thing appears, it always provokes a flurry of attacks from Right-leaning opportunists. It is only because we resolutely resist this adverse current that new things can grow smoothly. For new things, especially new things like the General Line, to advance smoothly, the first thing is to resist the evil wind, because only by resisting it can we engage in battle with it. Of course, resisting the evil wind of Right-leaning opportunism is not that easy. If one's spine is not strong enough, one cannot resist it. Some people have done many good things but still dare not affirm them. Some people do not have a clear understanding of the vitality of new things and lack firm determination and confidence. When Right-leaning opportunists attack one point and make indiscriminate accusations, they lose their judgment and even waver. There are also some people who can observe some signs of Right-leaning opportunism, but their fighting spirit is not strong, their sense of responsibility is not high, and they do not criticize or resist Right-leaning opportunist trends, allowing them to run rampant. This shows that to resist the evil wind of Right-leaning opportunism, it is necessary not only to improve the ability to distinguish between right and wrong but also to have the fearless spirit of upholding the truth. For all major issues, we must carefully examine them and delve into them to have a clear understanding of them. We must improve our ability to identify "winds" from all sides and see whether they are beneficial to socialism or capitalism, whether they promote socialist construction or hinder socialist construction. After distinguishing between right and wrong, we must also break through personal gains and losses, dare to uphold the truth, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against Right-leaning opportunism, even if we are temporarily in an isolated position.
    "Refute" means to use the method of presenting facts and reasoning to refute all kinds of Right-leaning opportunist arguments until they are completely discredited. In order to attack the correct line, Right-leaning opportunists are bound to spread many fallacies, such as slandering "going all out, aiming high" as "blind and reckless action," and "everyone striving to be upstream, the upstream will be blocked"; slandering the Great Leap Forward as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," "not worth the loss," "wasteful and harmful to the people," "creating market tension and disrupting the proportions of the national economy"; slandering the People's Communes as "done too early, too fast, and messed up," "superfluous," and so on. Of course, these slanders are like dark clouds to the sun and cannot obscure its brilliance. However, if they are not systematically and thoroughly refuted, they will have a market among some cadres with confused ideas and some well-to-do middle peasants and intellectuals. The reason why Right-leaning opportunists dare to launch attacks is precisely because they estimate that there are still some people inside and outside the Party who can be deceived and even utilized by them. Therefore, we must thoroughly refute the various fallacies of Right-leaning opportunists, criticize their mistakes ideologically, theoretically, and factually, so that people with unclear ideological understanding can learn to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, distinguish between major rights and wrongs in the struggle, and draw a clear line with Right-leaning opportunism, so that the market for Right-leaning opportunists will be reduced as much as possible, because only in this way can we stop them from making waves. When refuting the fallacies of Right-leaning opportunism, we must fully rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses and allow Right-leaning opportunists to debate. "A lamp does not shine if it is not turned, and a truth is not clear if it is not debated." Only by launching ideological clashes and debating thoroughly can we both isolate Right-leaning opportunists and unite and educate the majority.
    "Expose" means to thoroughly expose the conspiratorial activities and double-dealing tactics of Right-leaning opportunists so that everyone can see their essence. Facts tell us that the attacks of Right-leaning opportunists on the Party and the General Line are programmatic, purposeful, organized, and prepared. They are good at using double-dealing tactics, opposing Marxism while wearing the cloak of Marxism; opposing socialism while hanging the signboard of socialism; and opposing the General Line while waving the banner of the General Line. They are good at feigning compliance, resisting, distorting, and tampering with the Party's policies and guidelines, and smuggling in Right-leaning opportunist contraband. They are good at speculation and opportunism, watching the wind and steering the rudder. When they think it is advantageous, they seize the opportunity to move out and fan the flames; when they think it is disadvantageous, they hide and wait for the opportunity to rise again. They are good at disguise, often boasting that they have been "consistently correct," usually pretending to be straightforward and simple, but in fact, they are doing unspeakable deeds. They are good at spreading rumors, sowing discord, pulling and dragging, organizing sectarian cliques, and engaging in activities to split the Party.
    The conspiratorial activities of Right-leaning opportunists cannot be seen through without thorough exposure. It is not easy to see the essence through the phenomenon of anything, let alone Right-leaning opportunists deliberately create many false appearances to cover up themselves. Lenin once said: "In order to truly know the object, it is necessary to grasp and study all its aspects, all connections, and 'intermediaries'." Therefore, only by fully exposing the facts, mastering a large amount of material, and after comprehensive analysis, can we see their essence clearly. Things are often like this: when the anti-Party face of Right-leaning opportunists has not been fully exposed, it seems that the problem is not that serious, but after the masses expose it, their shameful face is exposed without a trace. This shows that no matter how good Right-leaning opportunists are at disguise, they cannot hide from the eyes and ears of the masses. As long as we rely on the masses and fully expose them, their vile and inferior class essence cannot be concealed.
    "Rectify" means to strengthen rectification and study, and to overcome Right-leaning thought and Right-leaning emotions. As early as the eve of liberation, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong sounded the alarm to us, asking all Party members to maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and prevent the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. In the ten years of struggle with the bourgeoisie, we have experienced several major storms. Some comrades showed an unwavering revolutionary stand, but some comrades wavered when the storm came. Some of them have not thoroughly transformed their class stand and lack ideological preparation for the socialist revolution; others have long been divorced from reality and the masses, lost their direction, so they showed temporary wavering in the great storm and unclear understanding of certain issues. Although this kind of Right-leaning thought and Right-leaning emotions are also a reflection of bourgeois thought within the Party, they are different in nature from Right-leaning opportunism. They do not belong to the scope of political issues but to the scope of ideological issues, and must be resolved through rectification and study, and strengthening positive education, so that they can stand firm on the proletarian stand, establish a Marxist world outlook, and strive for the cause of socialism.
    The history of our Party proves that rectification is the best method of ideological education. Comrade Mao Zedong once called on us to "hold a rectification movement every year or every two years." Since liberation, we have carried out many rectifications, especially the national rectification movement in 1957, which achieved extremely great gains on the political and ideological fronts. Now, it is necessary to carry out a new rectification movement among cadres, to conduct a debate on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, to thoroughly criticize Right-leaning thought, Right-leaning emotions, and other various erroneous understandings, to distinguish between major rights and wrongs, and to raise ideological awareness. In this rectification movement, we still adopt the method of being both serious and earnest and gentle and rain-like, starting from the desire for unity, and through criticism or struggle, to resolve contradictions and achieve new unity on a new basis. In this rectification movement, every comrade must dare to expose shortcomings, tell the truth, confide in the Party, and not hide their own views, because only in this way can they better receive the help of the Party and comrades and achieve the goal of self-transformation. We should also adopt the method of reading and debating in parallel, on the one hand, organizing everyone to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and on the other hand, conducting discussions in connection with reality, and use the theoretical principles of Marxism-Leninism to solve various ideological problems, so that everyone can greatly improve ideologically and theoretically. We must also implement the spirit of rectification into regular work and study, wash our faces and wipe off the black every day, prevent the corrosion of bourgeois ideology, and keep our team ideologically pure forever.
    The above methods are all the methods that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have long taught us, and they are effective methods for struggling against various opportunisms and various erroneous thoughts. We have used these methods in the past to wage a resolute struggle against Right-leaning opportunist thought and have achieved great victories. At present, we must better use these methods to defeat the attacks of Right-leaning opportunism and resolutely defend the Party's General Line.

    同右倾机会主义思想坚决作斗争
    中共安徽省委第一书记　曾希圣
    要坚决执行党的总路线，就必须同各种机会主义进行顽强的斗争。在党的历史上，在第二次国内革命战争时期，我们党内曾出现过三次“左”倾机会主义的错误路线，特别是1931年到1934年的王明路线，对于革命的损害最为严重。如果说，在那个时候，主要的危险是“左”倾机会主义，那么在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期主要的危险则是“右”倾机会主义。当然也有某些“左”倾情绪或某些“左”倾思想，但这是容易克服的，因为总的领导是正确的，在正确领导下的某些个别地方某些同志所发生的“左”的错误，一般是属于认识上的问题，他们还是要革命的，他们的出发点是想把事情办好，他们的缺点在于看问题的方法有“左”的片面性，只要对他们讲清道理，是容易转变过来的。而右倾机会主义则属于立场问题，是混进党内的阶级异己分子或投机分子，他们是资产阶级在党内的代言人，一有机会就兴风作浪，配合国内外敌人向党进攻，因此，这是党内的主要危险和长期危险。
    有人认为右倾机会主义是从“上面”来的，是从“外面”来的，和他们那里没有什么关系，好像他那里的领导是很正确的。这种认识是错误的。只要阶级存在，只要资产阶级的政治、思想影响还没有彻底消灭，右倾机会主义思想总是会有的。而且事实完全证明，右倾机会主义思想，不仅在经济工作部门有，在文化教育部门也有，各个部门各个地区都有，在高级领导机关有，在基层单位也一定会有，只是在程度上和表现形式上有所不同而已。有这种看法的人，正好证明他的右倾思想是严重的，对右倾机会主义视而不见，政治上麻痹，不是右倾是什么呢？
    有人认为只要和平教育，不要进行斗争，就可以执行党的总路线。这也是不对的。要使总路线切实实现，决不是风平浪静可以达到的。事实一再告诉我们，只要我们认真执行总路线，右倾机会主义分子必然会猖狂进攻。所谓“道高一尺魔高一丈”就是这个道理。因为这是阶级斗争的反映，是资产阶级同无产阶级两个对抗阶级生死斗争的反映。毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中一篇文章的按语里，把右倾病叫做“右倾顽症”，就是说明这种病是顽固性的，是根深蒂固的，既不是一次可以治好，更不是单靠教育说服可以奏效的，必须进行严肃的斗争，才能击退它们的进攻。要同右倾机会主义分子进行斗争，必须自己有勇气，有干劲，如果自己就是甘居中游，当然就谈不上斗争了。必须了解正确路线与错误路线是不能并存的，不此即彼，不动员全党全民起来，同右倾机会主义分子作斗争，克服右倾机会主义危险，党的正确路线就不可能坚决执行。安徽十年来的情况证明，认真克服右倾机会主义思想，是保卫总路线不可缺少的斗争。
    要坚决、全面执行党的总路线，争取更伟大的胜利，就必须进一步克服右倾机会主义思想。这是一件十分艰巨的工作，从这几年的经验来看，与右倾机会主义思想斗争必须紧紧掌握“顶”、“驳”、“揭”、“整”这四个字。
    “顶”，就是要硬着头皮顶住歪风。每当一个新的事物出现，总要引起右倾机会主义者的群起攻击，只是由于我们坚决地顶住这股逆流，才使新事物得以顺利成长。新生事物，特别是像总路线这种新生事物顺利前进，首先要顶住歪风，因为只有顶住它才能与它展开战斗。当然，顶住右倾机会主义的歪风并不那末容易，腰杆不硬，就顶不起来，有些人自己做了很多好事，但还不敢肯定下来，有些人对新事物的生命力认识不清，缺乏坚定的决心和信心，当右倾机会主义分子攻其一点和胡乱指责的时候，就失去了主见，甚至动摇起来。还有些人虽然能观察出右倾机会主义的一些征候，但他们的斗争性不强，责任心不高，对右倾机会主义思潮不批评，不抵制，让其泛滥。这就说明，要顶住右倾机会主义歪风，不仅要提高辨别是非的能力，还要具有坚持真理的大无畏精神。对一切重大问题，都要认真地摸一摸，钻一钻，作到心中有数，对来自各方面的“风”，要提高鉴别能力，看它到底是有利于社会主义，还是有利于资本主义，是促进社会主义建设，还是促退社会主义建设。在分清是非后，还要打破个人得失，勇于坚持真理，向右倾机会主义进行不调和的斗争，即使有时会暂时处于孤立的地位，也决不动摇。
    “驳”，就是要用摆事实、讲道理的方法，把各种右倾机会主义的论调驳得体无完肤。右倾机会主义者为了攻击正确路线，就必然要散布许多谬论，如他们污蔑“鼓足干劲，力争上游”是“盲目蛮干”，“人人争上游，上游就被堵住了”；污蔑大跃进是“小资产阶级的狂热性”，是“得不偿失”，“劳民伤财”，“造成了市场紧张，使国民经济比例失调”；污蔑人民公社“搞早了，搞快了，搞糟了”，是“多此一举”，等等。当然，这些诽谤有如乌云之于太阳，是蒙蔽不了它的光辉的。但是，如果不系统地彻底地加以批驳，在一部分思想糊涂的干部以及一部分富裕中农和知识分子中间，是会有它的市场的。右倾机会主义分子所以敢于发动进攻，也正是由于他们估计到党内外还有这样一些人可以被他们蒙蔽、欺骗，以至利用。所以，我们必须彻底批驳右倾机会主义分子的各种谬论，从思想上、理论上、事实上批判他们的错误，使思想认识不清的人，在斗争中学会识别香花毒草，分清大是大非，和右倾机会主义划清界限，使右倾机会主义者的市场缩小得越小越好，因为只有这样才能制止他们兴风作浪。在批驳右倾机会主义的谬论时，要充分依靠群众的力量和智慧，要允许右倾机会主义分子辩论。“灯不拨不亮，理不辩不明”，只有展开思想交锋，辩得彻底，才能既孤立右倾机会主义分子，又团结和教育大多数。
    “揭”，就是要彻底揭发右倾机会主义分子的阴谋活动和两面手法，使大家看清他们的本质。事实告诉我们，右倾机会主义分子对党对总路线的进攻是有纲领、有目的、有组织、有准备的。他们善于使用两面派的手法，披着马克思主义的外衣，反对马克思主义；挂着社会主义的招牌，反对社会主义；打着总路线的旗帜，反对总路线。他们善于阳奉阴违，抗拒、歪曲和篡改党的方针政策，偷运右倾机会主义的私货。他们善于投机取巧，看风使舵，当他们认为有利的时候，就乘机出动，煽风点火，当他们认为不利的时候，就隐蔽起来，伺机再起。他们善于伪装，经常吹嘘自己“一贯正确”，平时装成爽直、朴素，实际上是在干着不可告人的勾当。他们善于散布流言蜚语，挑拨离间，拉拉扯扯，组织宗派集团，进行分裂党的活动。
    右倾机会主义分子的阴谋活动，不经过彻底揭发，是很难看清他的本质的。不论任何事物，要透过现象看清本质，都不是一件容易的事，何况右倾机会主义分子有意造成许多假象，来掩饰自己。列宁曾经说过：“为着真正地认识对象，必须把握和研究它的一切方面，一切联系和‘媒介’”。所以只有充分揭发事实，掌握了大量的材料，经过综合和分析，才能看清他们的本质。事情往往是这样：当右倾机会主义分子的反党面目没有充分暴露以前，好像问题不是那末严重，但是，经过群众揭发以后，他们的可耻面目就暴露无遗了。这说明，不论右倾机会主义分子怎样善于伪装，都瞒不过群众的耳目，只要依靠群众，充分揭发，他们的卑鄙恶劣的阶级本质，是掩盖不了的。
    “整”，就是要加强整风学习，克服右倾思想和右倾情绪。早在解放前夕，党中央和毛泽东同志就向我们敲起警钟，要求全党同志保持高度的革命警惕性，预防资产阶级的糖衣炮弹。十年来在和资产阶级的斗争中，经历了多次较大的风浪。有些同志表现了坚定不移的革命立场，但也有一些同志，当着风浪一来，就动摇起来了。他们有的是阶级立场还没有得到彻底改造，缺乏社会主义革命的思想准备；有的是长期脱离实际，脱离群众，迷失方向，因此在大风浪中表现出暂时的动摇，在某些问题上认识不清。这种右倾思想和右倾情绪虽然也是资产阶级思想在党内的一种反映，但是，它和右倾机会主义在性质上是不同的，不属于政治问题的范围，而属于思想问题的范围，必须通过整风学习，加强正面教育加以解决，使他们站稳无产阶级立场，树立马克思主义世界观，为社会主义的事业而努力。
    我们党的历史证明，整风是一种最好的思想教育方法，毛泽东同志曾经号召我们“应该每年或每两年举行一次整风运动”。解放以来，我们进行过多次整风，特别是1957年的全民整风运动，在政治战线和思想战线上取得了极其巨大的收获，现在，有必要在干部中开展一次新的整风运动，对总路线、大跃进和人民公社进行一场辩论，彻底批判右倾思想、右倾情绪和其他各种错误认识，分清大是大非，提高思想觉悟。在这次整风运动中，仍然采取既严肃认真又和风细雨的方法，从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，使矛盾得到解决，在新的基础上达到新的团结。在这次整风运动中，每个同志都要勇于暴露缺点，说老实话，向党交心，不要隐蔽自己的观点，因为只有这样才能更好地得到党和同志的帮助，达到自我改造的目的。还应当采取读书与辩论并行的方法，一边组织大家认真学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，一边联系实际进行讨论，根据马列主义的理论原则，来解决各种思想问题，使大家在思想上、理论上大大提高一步。我们还要把整风精神贯彻到经常的工作和学习中去，天天洗脸擦黑，防止资产阶级思想的腐蚀，使我们的队伍永远保持思想上的纯洁性。
    以上这些办法，都是党中央和毛主席早已教导我们的办法，是与各种机会主义各种错误思想进行斗争的有效办法。我们过去运用了这些办法和右倾机会主义思想进行了坚决斗争，已取得了巨大的胜利。当前我们要更好地运用这些办法来战胜右倾机会主义的进攻，坚决保卫党的总路线。
