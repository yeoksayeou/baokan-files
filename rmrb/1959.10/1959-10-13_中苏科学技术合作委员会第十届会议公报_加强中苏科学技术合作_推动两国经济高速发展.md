Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Communiqué of the Tenth Session of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee:
    Strengthening Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation to Promote the Rapid Development of the Economies of Both Countries
    The Tenth Session of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee was held in Beijing from October 5th to 12th, 1959. The convening of this session coincides with the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement.
    To celebrate this significant occasion, reports summarizing the work of five years of scientific and technological cooperation were presented at the meeting, and experiences were exchanged. Both sides noted with great satisfaction that over the past five years, the Sino-Soviet Committee, under the correct leadership of the parties and governments of the two countries, has done much beneficial work in organizing the mutual application of the two countries' production experiences and scientific and technological achievements. The scope of scientific and technological cooperation has continuously expanded, the content of cooperation has become richer, and it has played a huge role in the development of the national economies of both countries. The experience and achievements provided by the Soviet Union are very beneficial to the smooth development of China's national economy. Similarly, the Soviet Union has also drawn on China's production experience and scientific and technological achievements in its national economic construction.
    Both sides pointed out that the direct connection and cooperation between the corresponding scientific research and design institutions of the two countries are of great significance for further developing Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation. Through direct cooperation, scientists and experts from China and the Soviet Union are working together on a large number of scientific research and experimental projects. On this basis, the friendly ties between the scientific research and design institutions of the two countries, as well as between the scientists and experts of the two countries, have been further consolidated and expanded.
    According to the resolutions of the Tenth Session of the Committee, the relevant Soviet institutions will receive Chinese experts to investigate the comprehensive utilization of natural gas, the construction and installation of radio microwave communications, the research on oil shale, and the design experience of open-pit coal mining, etc. The relevant Soviet institutions will also provide China with scientific and technological data on metallurgy, power, machinery manufacturing, coal industry, chemical industry, building materials industry, as well as research data on the physical chemistry of polymer compounds, and experimental research data on organic dye intermediates, etc.
    The relevant Chinese institutions will receive Soviet experts to investigate the beneficiation technology of molybdenum and tungsten mines, the problem of gas drainage in coal mines, and the scientific research work on improving and strengthening the process of synthetic ammonia production, etc. The relevant Chinese institutions will also provide the relevant Soviet institutions with scientific and technological data on metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, construction, coal industry, textile industry, and chemical industry, and will also provide scientific research reports on the production of some chemical products, as well as seed samples of crops, etc.
    Both sides noted with satisfaction that the Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation, carried out in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, is an integral part of the comprehensive cooperation, friendly mutual assistance between the two brotherly countries. The Sino-Soviet Committee is convinced that, based on the experience gained in the past five years, and in the context of the high-speed development of the national economies of the two countries, Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation will be further strengthened, and will make greater contributions to promoting the completion of the great tasks put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the June 1959 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU.
    The meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of sincere friendship, and a protocol of the meeting was signed.
