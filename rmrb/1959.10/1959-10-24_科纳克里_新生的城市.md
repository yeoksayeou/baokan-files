Conakry
——A City Reborn
By Wang Shu, our reporter

A year ago, before Guinea's referendum on October 2, 1958, rejected De Gaulle's "French Community" and declared independence, if you asked people where Guinea was, many might not have known. And if you asked what Guinea's capital was called, even more might have been unable to answer. Now, this long-overlooked country has begun to make its voice heard, and its existence and development since independence have increasingly attracted the attention of Asian, African, and other countries around the world.

Conakry is located at the tip of a long, narrow strip of land extending into the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by sea on three sides and backed by green hills. Opposite it, three small, green islands stand in the sea, protecting it from the impact of the Atlantic's strong winds and waves. The strong African sunlight, clear clouds, vast sea, sea breeze, beaches, and peaceful avenues shaded by coconut trees... But, during my several visits to Guinea, what impressed me most was not these poetic scenes, but the people here, their enthusiasm for rebuilding their motherland and resisting the pressure of the colonialists. Such enthusiasm can only be seen in a country that has gained independence and mobilized its people.

In Conakry and nearby towns, you can see groups of people in the morning and evening, carrying tools, going to various places to participate in unpaid voluntary labor. Among them are workers, civil servants, teachers, vendors, and residents, all working together to renovate and clean streets, remove garbage and ditches, tidy up government offices, schools, and hospitals, and prune trees and lawns in parks and streets. Smiling, they told me that they were responding to President Sékou Touré's call to eradicate the garbage of colonialism. This kind of enthusiasm for rebuilding the motherland is even more evident in the countryside. I visited Kindia, a town more than 100 kilometers from Conakry. Along the way, I saw many farmers, including women carrying children, elderly men with long beards, and even children, renovating roads, digging canals, building houses, and clearing forests to plant food crops, responding to the government's call to achieve food self-sufficiency in the shortest possible time. They built new schools and dormitories for students, houses for the homeless and the helpless elderly, and also new wells and roads. According to official statistics, in the year after independence, the Guinean people built more roads, houses, and schools than the French colonialists did in their entire period of rule, even several or dozens of times more. No matter how simple these roads and houses are, when I saw children in rural areas sitting in classrooms reading for the first time, and helpless elderly people dozing in houses filled with the fragrance of wood, I saw the power of the people and their future.

When I was visiting Kindia, several times many people gathered around, shouting "People's China, People's China," "Beijing, Beijing." They asked me about the situation in China in French. They shook my hand warmly, calling me comrade. I received enthusiastic hospitality everywhere, they showed me this and that, and told me with emphasis that this was what they had done after independence. I encountered this kind of enthusiastic situation many times during my visits to Guinea. This is the outpouring of the Guinean people's brotherly feelings for the Chinese people. President Sékou Touré has mentioned the great efforts of the Chinese people in rebuilding their motherland in many of his reports and speeches, and this has inspired the Guinean people's enthusiasm for construction. I will never forget this deep friendship. People often say when talking about the relations between Asian and African countries that common destiny links us together, and now I personally experience how much emotion and strength this sentence contains.

Conakry is filled with this kind of rebirth and vibrant scene everywhere. I went to the Republic Square in front of the Presidential Palace, surrounded by ancient trees, to take a walk again and again. The Presidential Palace was originally the residence of the French colonial governor, a restricted area for the Guinean people for many years. Now, the Guinean flag is flying over this building, and the statue of the first French colonial governor in the center of the square has been removed and replaced with Guinean flags on all four sides. The words praising this governor on the base have also been replaced by the words "Republic Square." A monument also stands in the city center, commemorating the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the fight against colonialism. During festivals, it is always filled with bouquets and crowded with people paying their respects. In the exhibition room of the museum by the sea, the exhibits that originally praised French colonialism and insulted the Guinean people have disappeared, replaced by Guinean folk art and handicrafts. In the courtyard outside the museum, there are piles of bronze statues of French governors, generals, and officials that have been removed from various places. In government offices, schools, nearby hydroelectric power stations, and many other places in Conakry, many Guineans are working diligently and managing affairs. When Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah visited Guinea in May this year and returned to Ghana, he said that if there are still people who say that Africans cannot manage their own country, then I would like to ask them to go to Guinea to see. This sentence is absolutely true.

Of course, as many Guineans have told me, their efforts are only the beginning. The cruel French colonial rule caused profound disasters in Guinea. Agriculture is in a very backward state, there is no industry, and the people live in extreme poverty. Guinea has vast fertile land, abundant mineral resources, especially iron and aluminum ore, and abundant fruits, coconuts, and vegetables; but food is insufficient, the iron used for small agricultural tools, the aluminum utensils used daily, and even canned fruits are imported from abroad. Guinea has so many products, but until last year, it had annual trade deficits, high market prices, and extremely high living costs. Large French banks and companies dominated Guinea's economy. Guinea had no its own banks, currency, or trade organizations. Guinea not only needs many schools and hospitals, but also has to create its own writing system and develop its own national culture. Of course, it will take time and great effort to eliminate these evil consequences of colonial rule. But the point is, as Sékou Touré said when he declared independence last year, now that we are independent, we can handle and solve our problems according to our own will.

Not many days ago, the Guinean people celebrated the first anniversary of their republic's independence with great joy. The Guinean people often told me that they did not spend this year easily, they spent it resisting all kinds of pressures from colonialism and overcoming many difficulties. During this year, French, American, and British colonialists, fearing the influence of this young republic on other parts of Africa, rudely exerted pressure and created difficulties, attempting to force it to abandon its foreign policy of peace and neutrality and its path of independent development. After Guinea declared independence, French colonialists withdrew officials, technicians, and teachers from Guinea, took away funds, burned archives, and even smashed office furniture. They also transported away the grain stored in Guinea, stopped import and export trade with Guinea, and even stopped accepting telegrams and telephone calls from Guinea. They attempted to create administrative and economic chaos in Guinea. At the same time, the bourgeois newspapers of France, the United States, and Britain launched a campaign of slander and insult against Guinea. They made all kinds of estimates, saying that this young republic would definitely collapse, attempting to isolate Guinea. However, Guinea, with the unity of the people across the country and the support of the people of Africa and the world, overcame these many difficulties, causing the colonialists to suffer a first-round defeat. Guinea tells all of Africa with its existence and development that only by choosing the path of independence can everything be improved and obtained.

During Guinea's difficult period, socialist countries extended a hand of selfless friendship to her. She received not only moral support but also economic assistance from these countries. Guinea first established commercial and trade relations with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic. The Director of Guinea's Foreign Trade Bureau and many other Guineans told me that socialist countries purchased Guinea's fruits and other products in large quantities at fair and reasonable prices, and supplied Guinea with the goods it needed. They also talked about the rice given to the Guinean people by the Chinese people. I cannot forget the long-lasting cheers and applause the heads of the delegations from the communist and workers' parties of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic received when they stepped onto the podium at the first congress of the Guinea Democratic Party after independence. They knew that socialist countries were their true friends.

The Guinean people are vigilantly preventing imperialist sabotage activities and defending their independence and development. Any foreigner taking photos in Conakry is subject to strict inspection to verify whether they have a photo-taking permit issued by the government. Military and police posts also check passports. The inspectors told me that they must resolutely prevent imperialist sabotage. Many Guineans I have come into contact with have said that imperialism will not be reconciled to failure and will exert greater pressure to force Guinea to submit. This young republic is undergoing various tests. However, people believe that as long as the Guinean people maintain a high degree of vigilance, unite as one, and adhere to a policy of peace and independence, these conspiracies can be defeated.

    科纳克里
    ——新生的城市
    本报记者　王殊
    在一年以前，也就是在几内亚去年10月2日公民投票拒绝戴高乐的“法兰西共同体”宣布独立以前，要问到几内亚在甚么地方的时候，可能有很多人答不上，问到几内亚首都叫甚么的时候，可能有更多的人答不上。现在，这个长期来不受人注意的国家开始发出了自己的声音，以它独立后的存在和发展越来越受到亚非和世界各国的注意了。
    科纳克里在一条伸出在大西洋中的狭长的土地的尖端上，三面环海，背靠绿色的岗岭。对面，三个小小的绿色的岛屿屹立在海中，保护它不受大西洋狂风疾浪的冲击。非洲的强烈的日照、透明的云彩、浩瀚的大海、海风、沙滩和海边掩映在椰子树丛里宁静的大道。但是，在我几次访问几内亚时，给我印象最深的不是这些诗情画意，而是这里的人民，他们的重建祖国、对抗殖民主义者的压力的热情，这样的热情只有在一个获得独立，并且把人民动员起来的国家中才能看到。
    在科纳克里市内和附近城镇中，早晨和傍晚都能看到成群结队的人，扛着工具，到各处去参加不计报酬的义务劳动。他们中有职工、公务人员、教师、商贩和居民，一起在翻修和打扫街道，清除垃圾堆和水沟，整理机关、学校和医院，修剪公园和街道上的树木和草地。他们笑着对我说，他们是响应总统塞古·杜尔的号召，来铲除殖民主义垃圾的。这种重建祖国的劳动热情在农村中看得更加清楚。我访问了离科纳克里一百多公里的金地亚镇，沿途看到了许许多多的农民，其中有背着孩子的妇女，长胡子的老人，甚至孩子们，在翻修公路，开挖水渠，修建房屋，砍伐森林开垦土地来种植粮食，响应政府在尽可能短的时间内粮食自给的号召。他们为学生们新修学校和宿舍，为露宿的人和无依无靠的老人修建房屋，还新修水井和道路。据官方统计，几内亚人在独立后一年内新修的公路、房屋、学校比整个法国殖民主义者统治期间所做的多了几倍，甚至几十倍。不管这些道路和房屋是如何的简陋，当我看到农村中的孩子们第一次坐在教室内读书，看到无依无靠的老人坐在散发着木材的清香的屋子里打盹的时候，我看到了人民的力量和他们的未来。
    当我在金地亚参观的时候，有几次有很多人围上来，向我喊“人民中国，人民中国”，“北京，北京”，他们用法文问我中国的情况。他们热烈地同我握手，称我同志。我到处受到热情的招待，给我看这个那个，并且用着重的语气告诉我，这是他们在独立后做的。在几内亚访问时，我有许多次遇到过这种热烈的情况。这是几内亚人民对中国人民的兄弟般的感情的流露。塞古·杜尔总统在他的许多报告和讲话中都提到中国人民重建祖国的巨大努力，并激励几内亚人民的建设热情。我永远不能忘记这种深厚的友谊。人们讲到亚非国家的关系时常常说，共同的命运把我们联系在一起，现在我身历其境地体会到这句话包含着多大的感情和力量啊。
    科纳克里到处充满着这种新生和生气勃勃的景象。我一次又一次地到总统府前面的古树环抱的共和国广场上去散步。总统府原先是法国的殖民总督府，多少年来是统治几内亚人的禁区。现在，这个房屋上飘扬着几内亚的国旗，广场中心的法国第一任殖民总督的铜像已经拆除，换上了四面几内亚的国旗。座身上颂扬这个总督的文字也已代之以“共和国广场”几个大字。市中心还挺立着一座纪念碑，纪念为反对殖民主义而牺牲的烈士。在节日里，这里总是堆满花束和拥挤着凭吊的人们。在海边的博物院的陈列室里，原来颂扬法国殖民主义和侮辱几内亚人的陈列品都消失了，换上几内亚的民间艺术和手工艺品。在博物院外面的场地上，堆放着从各地拆除下来的法国总督、将军、官员的铜像。在科纳克里市内的机关、学校，附近的水电站和其他许多地方，很多几内亚人在勤奋地工作着和管理着。加纳总理恩克鲁玛在今年5月访问几内亚回到加纳时就说，假使还有人说，非洲人不会管理自己的国家，那我要请他到几内亚去看看。这句话是千真万确的。
    当然，像许多几内亚人对我所说的那样，他们的努力还仅仅是个开始。残酷的法国殖民统治在几内亚造成的灾难是深重的，农业处在十分落后的状态，没有工业，人民生活在极度贫困之中。几内亚有广阔的肥沃的土地，丰饶的矿藏，特别是铁矿和铝矿，还有丰富的水果、椰子、蔬菜；但是粮食不足，小农具用的铁，日常用的铝质器皿，甚至水果罐头都是从国外进口的。几内亚有这么多的出产，但是，到去年为止，年年入超，市场上物价昂贵，生活费用极高。法国的大银行和大公司霸占着几内亚的经济，几内亚没有自己的银行、货币和贸易机构。几内亚不但需要许多的学校、医院，而且还要创立自己的文字，发展自己的民族文化。当然，这些殖民统治的恶果需要时间和极大的努力才能把它清除掉。但是，问题在于，像塞古·杜尔在去年宣布独立时所说的，现在，我们独立了，我们可以按照自己的意志来处理和解决我们的问题了。
    没有多少天以前，几内亚人兴高彩烈地庆祝了他们共和国的独立的一周年。几内亚人经常向我谈到，在这一年中，他们不是轻易度过的，他们是对抗了来自殖民主义的各种各样的压力，战胜了许许多多的困难度过的。在这一年中，法国、美国、英国殖民主义者由于害怕这个年青的共和国对非洲其他地区的影响，横暴地对它施加压力和制造困难，企图逼使它放弃和平中立的外交政策和独立发展的道路。在几内亚宣布独立后，法国殖民主义者撤走了在几内亚的官员、技术人员和教师，带走了资金，烧毁了档案材料，甚至捣毁了办公室的家具，他们还运走了贮存在几内亚的粮食，停止对几内亚的进出口贸易，甚至停止接受来自几内亚的电报电话，他们企图在几内亚制造行政上和经济上的混乱。同时，法国、美国和英国的资产阶级报刊发动了诽谤和侮辱几内亚的运动，他们作出各种各样的估计，说什么这个年青的共和国一定垮台，企图把几内亚置于孤立的境地。但是，几内亚在全国人民的团结和全非洲和世界人民的支持下，战胜了这许许多多的困难，使殖民主义者遭受了第一回合的失败。几内亚以它的存在和发展告诉全非洲，只有选择独立这条道路，才能改善一切和得到一切。
    在几内亚困难的期间，社会主义国家向她伸出了无私的友谊的手。她从这些国家不但得到了道义上的支持和经济上的援助。几内亚首先同苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、波兰和德意志民主共和国建立了商务和贸易的关系。几内亚对外贸易局局长和其他许多几内亚人对我谈到，社会主义国家以公平合理的价格大量购买了几内亚的水果和其他产品，并且供应了几内亚需要的物品。他们也谈到了中国人民赠送给几内亚人民的大米。我不能忘记，在几内亚民主党举行的独立后的第一次代表大会上，当苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和德意志民主共和国共产党和工人党代表团的团长走上讲台时所受到的代表们的长时间的欢呼和鼓掌。他们知道，社会主义国家是他们的真正的朋友。
    几内亚人正在警惕地防止帝国主义的破坏活动，保卫自己的独立和发展。凡是带着照相机在科纳克里市内拍摄照片的外国人，都要受到严格的检查，查明是否有政府发给的拍摄照片的证件。军警岗哨还要检查护照。检查人员对我说，他们要坚决防止帝国主义的破坏。很多我接触到的几内亚人都谈到，帝国主义是不会甘心失败的，他们会施行更大的压力逼使几内亚就范。这个年青共和国正在经历着各种各样的考验。但是，人们都相信，只要几内亚人民保持高度的警惕，团结一致，坚持和平独立的政策，这些阴谋是可以击败的。（附图片）
