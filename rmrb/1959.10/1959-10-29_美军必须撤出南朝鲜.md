The Sixth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea unanimously adopted a letter to the "National Assembly of the Republic of Korea" and the South Korean people on October 27, calling on them to unite and carry out a nationwide struggle to force U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The letter also put forward many major and specific suggestions to promote North-South exchanges and consultations. On the same day, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea also unanimously adopted a letter to the parliaments of all countries on the same issue, appealing to the parliaments and political activists of all countries in the world and all peace-loving people, calling on them to support the national aspirations and just struggle of the Korean people, and to support the Korean people's demand for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, headed by the U.S. military, from Korea and the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea without foreign interference. The Chinese people warmly support the suggestions and appeals of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly, which are fully in line with the interests of the Korean people and the people of the world.

The Chinese people have always believed that the reunification of Korea is a matter for the Korean people themselves, opposed foreign interference, and resolutely advocated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. At the beginning of the Korean War, the Chinese people demanded that the invading U.S. troops immediately withdraw from Korea. It was only when U.S. imperialism disregarded the solemn warnings of the Chinese people, not only invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also armed and occupied our territory of Taiwan and seriously threatened our security, that the Chinese people formed the Volunteers and fought side by side with the Korean people against U.S. aggression. After more than three years of heroic fighting, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies finally forced the U.S. aggressors to accept the armistice. After the start of the armistice negotiations, Korea and China repeatedly advocated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, so that the Korean people could solve the problem of peaceful reunification of Korea themselves. However, this legitimate demand has always been unreasonably rejected by the United States. In order to break the deadlock on the Korean issue, our government, at the beginning of last year, responded to the proposal of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and suggested that the Chinese People's Volunteers take the initiative to withdraw from Korea. This proposal was supported and responded to by all the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers. They began to withdraw from Korea on March 15 last year and completed the withdrawal on October 25. The sincere efforts of the Chinese People's Volunteers to strive for peace have been warmly welcomed and praised by peace-loving people all over the world. Fair-minded public opinion in all countries has demanded that the U.S. government and the governments of all countries participating in the so-called United Nations forces take the same steps and withdraw all their troops from South Korea without delay, in order to facilitate the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the easing of tensions in the Far East.

It has been a full year since the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea. In the past year, the United States has not only refused to withdraw its troops from South Korea, but has intensified its efforts to transport new weapons to South Korea and establish missile bases in South Korea; at the same time, it has intensified its control over the Syngman Rhee army and actively prepared for war. At the same time, in the past year, provocative incidents in violation of the armistice agreement, such as the U.S. side's invasion of North Korean airspace, dispatch of special agents to cross the border to sabotage, and armed attacks, have continued to occur. The United States not only instigated the Syngman Rhee clique to frequently clamor for a "northward advance" to create tension, but also some U.S. military leaders, such as Decker, commander of the U.S. forces invading Korea, openly issued war cries such as "war may break out again on the Korean peninsula" and "there is currently a truce rather than peace" in Korea. The United States' ambition to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, permanently occupy South Korea, and use South Korea as a springboard for its new aggression in the Far East is obvious.

The United States' refusal to withdraw its troops from South Korea and its active planning to turn South Korea into a base for atomic warfare is part of the United States' overall conspiracy to maintain tension in the Far East and carry out aggressive activities. Recently, U.S. imperialism has openly insisted on long-term occupation of our territory of Taiwan, and threatened to use force to interfere in our internal affairs; at the same time, it has accelerated the arming of Japan, fostered Japanese militarism, and strived to revise the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" to strengthen the open military alliance between the two countries. The United States is also instigating the Sananikone government in Laos to undermine the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, and to provoke civil war in Laos. These actions by the United States have greatly exacerbated international tensions and threatened the peace and security of Asian countries.

U.S. imperialism has come up with all kinds of absurd excuses to stay in South Korea, but these excuses are completely untenable. U.S. troops have no reason to come to the Korean territory in the first place. Today, a full year after the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, U.S. troops have even less reason not to withdraw from Korea. The United States insists on holding free elections under the supervision of the United Nations as a prerequisite for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, which is nothing more than obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and wanting to expand the criminal rule of the U.S.-controlled Syngman Rhee puppet clique to North Korea, and turn the entire Korea into its military base and colony. Everyone knows that South Korea under U.S. occupation has become a living hell. The Korean people will absolutely not accept this arrangement of U.S. imperialism. The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea now once again proposes that after all foreign troops have withdrawn from South Korea, free general elections should be held throughout Korea in accordance with the will of the Korean people without any external interference, in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea; and suggests that the armies of North and South Korea should be reduced, and economic and cultural exchanges should be developed; representatives of North and South Korea should sit down and discuss the grand plan for peaceful reunification. This is a truly practical way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

In the past year, the Korean people's call for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea has become even louder. The people of North Korea have launched a massive struggle demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. Even in South Korea, which is under strict U.S. control, the movement demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops is also developing. This legitimate desire of the Korean people has been resolutely supported by all peace-loving people. On June 25 this year, the "Day of Struggle to Demand the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from South Korea" was widely held around the world. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea have become the common demand of all peace-loving people. The U.S. ruling clique cannot pretend not to hear this powerful call.

Thanks to the joint efforts of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people all over the world, the international situation has begun to ease in some aspects, and people hope to further eliminate the ice of the "Cold War." The U.S. authorities have also made indications of willingness to have peace. Therefore, people have reason to demand that the United States take practical actions to prove its sincerity for peace, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea is the least that should be done. As the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea said in its letter to the parliaments of all countries: "The continued division of Korea and the continued threat of war in Korea, all of this stems from the continued stationing of U.S. troops in South Korea." The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The situation in which U.S. troops remain in South Korea, obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, and threaten peace in the Far East cannot be allowed to continue. People all over the world are watching the actions of the United States. U.S. troops must withdraw from South Korea.

### 美军必须撤出南朝鲜

    美军必须撤出南朝鲜
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第六次会议在10月27日一致通过了给“大韩民国国会”和南朝鲜人民的信，号召他们一致团结起来进行全民性的斗争，迫使美军撤出南朝鲜，争取祖国的和平统一。这封信还提出了许多促进南北来往和协商的重大具体建议。在同一天，朝鲜最高人民会议还一致通过了就同一问题给世界各国议会的信，向全世界一切国家的议会和政治活动家以及全体爱好和平人民呼吁，呼吁他们支持朝鲜人民的民族愿望和正义斗争，支持朝鲜人民要求以美军为首的一切外国军队撤出朝鲜和在没有外国军队干涉下实现朝鲜和平统一。中国人民热烈支持朝鲜最高人民会议这种完全符合朝鲜人民和世界人民利益的建议和呼吁。
    中国人民从来就认为朝鲜的统一是朝鲜人民自己的事情，反对外国进行干涉，坚决主张一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。在朝鲜战争爆发之初，中国人民就要求美国的侵略军队立即撤出朝鲜。只是在美帝国主义无视中国人民的严正警告，不仅侵略了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并且武装侵占我国领土台湾和严重地威胁我国的安全的时候，中国人民才组成志愿军和朝鲜人民并肩反抗美国的侵略。朝中人民军队经过三年多的英勇战斗，终于迫使美国侵略者接受了停战。在停战谈判开始以后，朝中两国又一再主张从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，让朝鲜人民自己去解决朝鲜的和平统一问题。但是这种正当的主张一直遭到美国的无理拒绝。为了打开在朝鲜问题上的僵局，我国政府在去年年初即响应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的倡议，建议中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，这一建议受到全体志愿军官兵的拥护和响应，他们于去年3月15日开始撤出朝鲜，到10月25日全部撤完。中国人民志愿军真诚争取和平的行动，获得了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和赞扬，各国公正舆论都要求美国政府和参加所谓联合国军的各国政府采取同样步骤，毫不拖延地把自己的军队全部撤出南朝鲜，以利于朝鲜问题的和平解决和远东紧张局势的缓和。
    中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜已经整整一年。在过去一年的时间里，美国不但拒绝从南朝鲜撤军，反而变本加厉地一面加紧向南朝鲜运入新式武器，在南朝鲜建立导弹基地；一面加紧控制李承晚军队，积极进行备战。同时，一年来美国方面侵犯朝鲜北部领空、派遣特务越界捣乱和进行武装袭击等违反停战协定的挑衅事件仍然不断发生。美国不但指使李承晚集团经常叫嚷“北进”来制造紧张局势，而且美国的一些军事首领如侵朝美军总司令德克尔之流也公然发出“朝鲜半岛可能再度发生战争”、在朝鲜“目前是休战而不是和平”一类的战争叫嚣。美国企图阻挠朝鲜实现和平统一，永久霸占南朝鲜，利用南朝鲜作为它在远东进行新侵略跳板的野心是昭然若揭的。
    美国拒绝从南朝鲜撤军，积极策划把南朝鲜变成原子战争的基地，是美国在远东保持紧张局势、进行侵略活动的整个阴谋计划的一部分。最近美帝国主义公开坚持长期侵占我国领土台湾，并且威胁要用武力来干涉我国内政；同时加速武装日本、扶植日本军国主义，力谋修改“日美安全保障条约”，加强两国公开的军事同盟。美国还在老挝唆使萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，挑起老挝内战。美国的这些行动，大大地加剧了国际紧张局势，威胁着亚洲国家的和平和安全。
    美帝国主义为了赖在南朝鲜不走，想出各种荒谬的借口，但是这些借口都是完全站不住脚的。美国军队本来就没有任何理由开到朝鲜的国土上来。在中国人民志愿军全部撤离朝鲜已经整整一年的今天，美国军队就更没有任何理由不从朝鲜撤走。美国坚持所谓在联合国监督下举行自由选举作为撤退美军的先决条件，无非是要阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，而想把美国控制的李承晚傀儡集团的罪恶统治扩大到朝鲜北部，把整个朝鲜变为它的军事基地和殖民地。谁都知道，在美国占领下的南朝鲜已经成为人间地狱。朝鲜人民是绝对不能接受美国帝国主义的这种摆布的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议现在再一次主张在一切外国军队全部撤出南朝鲜以后，在没有任何外力干涉的情况下，根据朝鲜人民的意志，进行全朝鲜的自由普选，以实现朝鲜的和平统一；并且建议裁减南北朝鲜的军队，发展经济、文化交流；南北朝鲜的代表坐下来协商和平统一大计。这是和平解决朝鲜问题的真正切实可行的办法。
    一年来，朝鲜人民要求美国军队撤出南朝鲜的呼声是更加高涨了。朝鲜北部的人民展开了声势浩大的要求美军撤出南朝鲜的斗争。就是在美国严密控制的朝鲜南部，要求美军撤走的运动也在日益发展。朝鲜人民的这种正当愿望得到了一切爱好和平人民的坚决支持。在今年6月25日，在世界各地广泛举行了“要求美军撤出南朝鲜斗争日”。美军撤出南朝鲜和实现朝鲜的和平统一，已成为一切爱好和平人民的一致要求。美国统治集团对于这种强大的呼声，假装听不见是不成的。
    由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的共同努力，国际局势在某些方面开始趋向缓和，人们都希望能够进一步消除“冷战”的冰块。美国当局也曾作出愿意和平的表示。因此人们有理由要求美国拿出实际的行动来证明它对和平的诚意，而从南朝鲜撤退美军就是起码应当做的事情。朝鲜最高人民会议给世界各国议会的信中说得对：“朝鲜继续分裂和在朝鲜继续产生战争威胁，所有这一切，其根源都在于美军继续驻扎在南朝鲜。”朝鲜问题应当由朝鲜人民自己解决。美军赖在南朝鲜、阻挠朝鲜和平统一和威胁远东和平的局面决不能容许长此继续下去。全世界人民都在注视美国的行动。美国军队必须撤出南朝鲜。
