    Jiangsu Widely Establishes Four Types of Demonstration Fields
　　Use Command Fields as Models for Large Fields; Use Experimental Fields for Scientific Experiments
　　Use Basic Fields to Promote Substantial Production Increase; Use High-Yield Plots to Raise High-Yield Banners
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 18th. Cadres in various counties and people's communes in Jiangsu Province are planting high-yield command fields and experimental fields on a large scale during the autumn planting season. While leading the masses to expand the planting area of overwintering crops, they are also vigorously developing basic fields and high-yield plots. Using high-yield command fields as models, they are leading the masses to improve the quality of autumn planting and launching a vigorous high-yield competition movement to strive for a greater leap forward in next year's summer harvest yield.
    Before the autumn planting movement began, cadres in various counties and people's communes in Jiangsu Province summarized the various experiences in leading the great leap forward in agricultural production. They deeply realized that in recent years, especially since last year, the large-scale planting of experimental fields, basic fields, and high-yield plots has played a positive role in effectively implementing various agricultural production increase measures and technical measures, establishing high-yield banners, and promoting large-scale high-yield movements. Therefore, from the beginning of this year's autumn planting, cadres at all levels have fully utilized this effective leadership experience and developed a high-yield command field on the basis of the experimental field. This high-yield command field is a model for cadres at all levels to lead ordinary large fields from planting to wheat harvest; basic fields are the base for ensuring substantial production increases; high-yield plots are the position for cultivating high-yield banners; and experimental fields are used for agricultural science and various technical experiments. According to the plan, people's communes generally allocate one-thousandth of the planting area as high-yield command fields and experimental fields, and 20% of the planting area as basic fields and high-yield plots.
    This year, the characteristics of large-scale command fields, experimental fields, basic fields, and high-yield plots in Jiangsu are: more participants, stronger leadership determination, greater momentum, and more enthusiasm. The vast number of rural party members and cadres throughout the province are using great effort to unite and lead the broad masses of commune members to strive for a greater bumper harvest of summer crops next year. The Haian County Party Committee, led by the first secretary, took the lead in creating thirteen high-yield plots, totaling 20,000 mu. Under the leadership of the county party secretary, many commune and team cadres loudly proposed the battle cry of "Sweep away right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, vigorously develop high-yield plots, everyone beats the war drum, and we must make the three wheats catch up with rice." More than 10,000 commune and team cadres in the county took to the field, creating a total of 57,900 mu of high-yield command fields and experimental fields, and 259,000 mu of high-yield plots. In the Suzhou area, which has a relatively high grain yield, 300,000 cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers worked together to create 100,000 mu of high-yield command fields, experimental fields, and high-yield plots, determined to lead the broad masses of commune members in a major effort to achieve the goal of "rapeseed exceeding the three wheats (wheat, barley, naked barley), and the three wheats doubling" in the summer of next year.
    During the autumn planting movement, cadres at all levels demonstrated the specifications and quality of autumn planting in high-yield command fields and high-yield plots, and promoted them through field meetings, on-site visits, and other forms, effectively implementing production increase measures such as deep plowing and deep turning, rational close planting, and sufficient base fertilizer application, and improving the quality of large-area planting. After cadres at all levels in Changshu County made demonstrations in high-yield command fields and high-yield plots, the county and commune party committees successively held several autumn planting on-site meetings, organizing cadres and commune members to visit and learn from each other. Many people said after the visit: only with high standards of planting this year can we have high yields in the summer harvest next year, so they tried every means to improve the quality of planting. More than 100,000 mu of three wheats already planted in the county have generally been deep plowed to a depth of five to six inches, and 150 dan of base fertilizer per mu has been applied, and more than 900,000 jin of seeds have been selected through five stages of screening, wind selection, and salt water selection. Yangzhong County, which achieved a bumper harvest of three wheats this summer, had the county party committee first secretary create a 24 mu high-yield plot in Sanmao Commune, which first demonstrated the "three-ization" model of horticultural cultivation, standardized specifications, and systematic water ditches. All communes used this high-yield plot as a model and followed it at all levels. The 160,000 mu of three wheats already planted in the county have all reached the "three-ization" standard.
    People's communes everywhere are using high-yield command fields and high-yield plots as positions to enthusiastically carry out high-yield competitions. At the beginning of the autumn planting season, cadres at all levels in Lianshui County launched a "thousand, hundred, ten thousand" mu high-yield competition movement, that is, each production team developed 100 mu, each production brigade developed 1,000 mu, and each commune developed 10,000 mu of high-yield plots. Teams and communes found their own opponents, linked up with each other, and carried out competitions. After visiting the horticultural standard of the high-yield command field of Shuangfeng Commune, the commune and team cadres of 15 communes including Dongjiao, Xijiao, and Xinmao in Taicang County decided to compete with Shuangfeng Commune. After analyzing the current excellent rural situation and the potential for production increase, they were ambitious and actively revised their production increase targets. Among more than 200 brigades, 159 brigades increased their original production increase target from 20% to 60% to 60% to more than 100%; 46 brigades increased their original production increase target from 40% to 60% to 100% to 150%; and 22 brigades increased their original production increase target from 60% to 80% to 150% to 200%. The commune and team cadres of Gulong Commune in Gaochun County were greatly inspired after visiting the cadre command field in Huangshan Commune. The autumn planting measures were greatly increased. The entire commune launched a rush to accumulate 850,000 dan of fertilizer, and the average base fertilizer per mu increased from the original dozen dan to more than 50 dan. Deep plowing was generally carried out to a depth of more than five inches, and field grading and drainage facilities were also prepared.

　　提高秋播质量，力争明年夏收更大跃进
    江苏普建四类示范田
　　以指挥田为大田的标兵　以试验田作科学实验
　　以基本田促大幅度增产　以丰产片树高产旗帜
    新华社南京18日电　江苏各县和各人民公社的干部，在秋种中大种高产指挥田、试验田；领导群众在扩大越冬作物播种面积的同时，大搞基本田和高额丰产片，并以高产指挥田作标兵，带动群众提高秋播质量，掀起了轰轰烈烈地力争明年夏收产量更大跃进的高额丰产竞赛运动。
    秋种运动开始前，江苏各县和各地人民公社的干部，总结了领导农业生产大跃进的各项经验，深切体会到几年来特别是去年以来，由于大种试验田、基本田和高额丰产片，对于切实贯彻各项农业增产措施和技术措施，树立高产旗帜，推动大面积丰产运动，所起的积极的作用。因此，今年各级干部从秋种一开始，就充分运用了这条行之有效的领导经验，并在试验田的基础上又发展了一种高产指挥田。这种高产指挥田是各级干部从播种到麦收，带动一般大田的标兵；基本田是保证大幅度增产的基地；高额丰产片是培植高产旗帜的阵地；试验田则用来进行农业科学和各种技术的试验。据规划，各地人民公社一般都拿出千分之一的播种面积作高产指挥田和试验田，以20％的播种面积作为基本田和高额丰产片。
    今年，江苏各地大搞指挥田、试验田、基本田和高额丰产片的特点是：参加的人数更多，领导决心更强，声势更大，干劲更足。全省广大农村党员、干部都用大干特干的劲头，团结和领导广大社员奋力夺取明年夏熟作物更大丰收。中共海安县委以第一书记为首的十一名常委，一马当先，搞了十三个高额丰产片，共达两万亩。在县委书记带动下，许多社队干部响亮地提出
  “横扫右倾鼓干劲，大闹高额丰产片，人人都把战鼓敲，定要三麦赶水稻”的战斗口号，全县一万多名社队干部，个个上阵，共搞高产指挥田、试验田五万七千九百多亩，高额丰产片二十五万九千多亩。粮食产量较高的苏州专区，有三十万干部、技术员和老农一齐上阵，共搞高产指挥田、试验田、高额丰产片十万亩，决心带领广大社员大干一场，实现明年夏季“油菜超三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦），三麦成倍翻”的奋斗目标。
    在秋种运动中，各级干部都在高产指挥田、高额丰产片上对秋播规格质量做出样子，通过田头会议、现场参观等形式，加以推广，有力地贯彻了深耕深翻、合理密植、施足基肥等增产措施，提高了大面积播种质量。常熟县各级干部在高产指挥田、高额丰产片上做出样子以后，县和公社党委连续召开了多次秋播现场会议，组织干部、社员互相参观学习。许多人参观以后都说：只有今年播种高标准，才有明年夏收高产量，因此都千方百计地提高播种质量。全县已播种的十万多亩三麦，普遍深耕五到六寸，每亩施足基肥一百五十担，九十多万斤种籽都经过筛选、风选、盐水选种等五关。今年夏季获得三麦大丰收的扬中县，县委第一书记在三茅公社搞了二十四亩丰产片，第一个做出了耕作园艺化、规格标准化、水沟系统化的“三化”样子，各公社都以这块高额丰产片为标兵，层层仿行，全县已播种的十六万亩三麦，都达到了“三化”的标准。
    各地人民公社都以高产指挥田、高额丰产片为阵地，热烈地开展了丰产竞赛。涟水县各级干部在秋种一开始，就掀起了“千、百、万”亩丰产竞赛运动，即每个生产小队搞一百亩、生产大队搞一千亩、公社搞一万亩的高额丰产片，队与队、公社与公社自找对象，互相挂钩，开展竞赛。太仓县东郊、西郊、新卯等十五个公社的社队干部，参观了双峰公社高产指挥田园艺化的标准以后，决心与双峰公社大赛一场。他们在分析了当前农村大好形势和增产潜力以后，雄心勃发，积极修订增产指标。在二百多个大队中，有一百五十九个大队从原定增产二成至六成提高到六成至一倍以上；有四十六个大队从原定增产四成至六成提高到一倍至一倍半；有二十二个大队从原定增产六成至八成提高到一倍半至两倍。高淳县顾陇公社的社队干部，参观了凰山公社干部指挥田，受到很大启发，秋播措施大大加码，全公社突击积肥八十五万担，平均每亩基肥由原来十多担增加到五十多担，普遍深耕五寸以上，并做好了田间分级排水设施。
