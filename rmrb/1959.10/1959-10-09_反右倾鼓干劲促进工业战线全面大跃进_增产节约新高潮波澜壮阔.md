    Anti-Rightist Drive Boosts Morale and Promotes Overall Leap Forward on the Industrial Front
    A Magnificent New Upsurge in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    The characteristics of this new upsurge are: rapid momentum, large scale, both vigorous and down-to-earth; significant results, with production rising steadily; simultaneous progress in high output, high quality, low consumption, and safety; and a great promotion of the communist spirit of cooperation.
    Xinhua News Agency, October 8th – Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Lin summarizes the current situation of the new upsurge in the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial front: Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to oppose Rightism, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy, a vigorous mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy has been launched on the industrial front, setting off a new production upsurge and creating a situation of overall boiling activity. This new upsurge in the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy has very distinct characteristics: First, it has rapid momentum and a large scale, being both vigorous and down-to-earth; second, it has significant results, with production rising steadily, breaking the “conventional pattern” of being slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end; third, high output, high quality, low consumption, and safety are all advancing simultaneously; and fourth, the communist spirit of cooperation has been greatly promoted.
    After the Party Central Committee put forward the call to oppose Rightism and boost morale at the end of July and the beginning of August, various mobilization meetings, broadcast rallies, skills competitions, and Leap Forward oath-taking rallies were held across the country. Subsequently, various evaluations were carried out, red flags were planted, pace-setters were established, and various competitions were launched, such as inter-factory competitions, intra-work type competitions, counterpart competitions, pace-setter competitions, red flag competitions, and rival competitions, setting off a wave of enthusiasm for comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. This mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy quickly swept across more than twenty provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Almost all workers and staff in heavy industry departments, light industry departments, transportation departments, key enterprises, and non-key enterprises were involved in the movement. By late August, after the Central Committee's resolution on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy was published, the broad masses of workers and staff were further inspired by the call to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year and to catch up with Britain in about ten years. The movement was launched with great vigor and developed into a full-scale upsurge in September.
    The effects of this new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy are very significant. The total industrial output value in August increased by nearly 14% compared to July, and in September it increased by more than 27% compared to August, reaching the highest level this year. Cumulatively from January to September, the total industrial output value has increased by 45.5% compared to the same period last year. Among the sixty major products, fifty increased in August compared to July, and fifty-four increased in September compared to August. Steel increased by 13.5% in August compared to July, and by another 20% in September compared to August, equivalent to the total production level of 1952. Pig iron increased by 7.3% in August compared to July, and by another 25% in September compared to August, exceeding the total output of 1952. Coal increased by 11.5% in August compared to July, and by another 18% in September compared to August. The production of light industry and the textile industry has also greatly improved. In September, the output value of consumer goods increased by 26.9% compared to August, including a 14.2% increase in cotton yarn, a 22.1% increase in rubber shoes, and a 100% increase in cigarettes.
    In this new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, many enterprises have broken the "conventional pattern" of being slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end, making production rise steadily. For example, steel and pig iron increased by 8%-11% in the first ten days of September compared to the last ten days of August, and power generation also increased by about two million kilowatt-hours in the first ten days of September compared to the last ten days of August. In Beijing, it was rare for the city to complete one-third of the total monthly output value in the first ten days of the month, but in the first ten days of September, it completed 33.5%. The Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant only manufactured fifty-two freight cars in the first ten days of August, but it manufactured eighty-five freight cars in the first ten days of September. Although there was a three-day holiday for National Day, the production situation in early October was also very good. September was the month with the highest steel output in Chongqing, but the output in the first five days of October increased compared to the average daily output in September, with steel increasing by 1.77%, pig iron increasing by more than 28%, and steel材 increasing by more than 27%.
    The effects of this new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy are not only reflected in high output, but also in the all-around blooming of high quality, low consumption, and safety. In August, the qualification rates of pig iron, electric furnace steel, and converter steel in the eighteen key iron and steel enterprises all improved. The ash content and gangue content of raw coal in nineteen units such as Fushun, Fuxin, and Datong were all reduced. The first-class product rates of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai, Qingdao, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and other places also improved. The quality of newsprint and cement bag paper has improved even more significantly. According to statistics from more than twenty key cities, the scrap rates in the first and middle ten days of September decreased compared to August, with iron castings decreasing from 11.1% to 9.4%, steel castings decreasing from 10.5% to 9.3%, and machined parts decreasing from 2.5% to 1.6%. The qualification rate of transformers at the Shanghai Dada Electric Motor Factory increased from 67% from January to May to 97%. In the iron and steel industry, the consumption of coke per ton of iron smelted by the eighteen key enterprises in August decreased by 2.4% compared to July. In the power industry, the standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour in August decreased by 0.6% compared to July. In September, the consumption of pit props in the coal industry and the consumption of raw materials in weaving, cigarette, and chemical plants all decreased.
    In this upsurge, the communist spirit of cooperation has not only been widely promoted within enterprises, but also between enterprises, between industries, and between departments, with greater promotion than in the past. The recently emerged "one-dragon great collaboration" between factories and mines, railways, ports, ships, and commercial departments is a clear example.
    There are many reasons why this new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy has come with such momentum and has had such great effects.
    First of all, the most fundamental reason is that the Eighth Plenary Session's call to oppose Rightism, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy has greatly inspired the broad masses of cadres and workers, and the Right-leaning and slackening sentiments existing in some cadres have been overcome, so that many key issues in production have been quickly resolved. For example, the coal washing and coking problem of the Nanjing Shimenkan Iron and Steel Plant had not been resolved for three months due to a few cadres emphasizing difficulties, but after opposing Rightism, it was resolved in three days. Another example is that after the workshop director of the Sichuan Leshan Steel Plant was criticized for his conservative and fear-of-difficulty thinking that the highest daily output could only reach sixty-five tons, the output rose to seventy-three tons the next day, and now it has reached more than one hundred tons.
    Secondly, the experience of carrying out mass movements on the industrial front last year has been developed, and the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" method has been universally implemented. While letting go of mobilizing the masses, enterprise management and the organization of the movement have been strengthened. Leading cadres of many enterprises have gone deep into workshops and groups to work, making the combination of leadership and the masses closer. Many enterprises in Shanghai have formed "three combination" groups to solve various key problems under contract. The Fushun Xinqiu Mine originally believed that the ore source was insufficient when arranging the production plan, with a shortage of 180,000 tons. This time, after the mine's leading cadres, technicians, and workers combined to go down to find ore sources, it turned out that they could overproduce 100,000 tons. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation originally could not supply ore. After the movement started, the deputy general manager took the lead in going up the mountain, effectively solving the key problems in production, and the daily output of ore gradually increased from 3,000 tons in early August to more than 6,700 tons. All localities have generally paid attention to grasping daily progress and grasping measures in the movement, so the movement has been carried out enthusiastically and practically. In the red flag competition in Shanghai, factories and factories, workshops and workshops, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals were paired up, not only comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, but also helping and encouraging the backward to catch up with the advanced. Hebei Province extracted 3,500 people, formed 140 groups according to industry, and carried out inspection, evaluation, and summary of the competition. Shaanxi Province established three red flag groups through newspapers, and also sent pace-setter groups or pace-setter teams composed of advanced figures to various places to impart experience.
    Thirdly, the broad masses of workers have generally combined hard work and skillful work, carried out technological innovation activities, and promoted advanced experiences. For example, from August 1st to 25th, the factories under the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau implemented 496 technological innovation proposals, creating a value of more than 440,000 yuan and saving 51 tons of metal materials and more than 50,000 tons of fuel. The foundry workshop of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Plant promoted the mud molding method, which increased work efficiency by more than five times. After the woodworking workshop of this factory changed the hand planer to an electric planer, the efficiency increased tenfold. From January to July, this factory only produced 367 opening and cleaning machines and sizing machines in total, while in August, due to the good development of technological innovation, it produced 370 units. The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant improved cutting tools, increasing output by four times, and improved molds, increasing efficiency by eleven times. After the converter workshop of the Daye Steel Plant changed the tuyere to a horseshoe shape, it averaged four to six more furnaces per day.
    Judging from the situation in various places, the movement is still developing in a broader and deeper direction. It is conceivable that greater and more achievements will follow one after another.

    反右倾鼓干劲促进工业战线全面大跃进
    增产节约新高潮波澜壮阔
    这次新高潮的特点是：来势猛，规模大，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实；效果显著，生产节节上升；高产和优质、低耗、安全同时并进；共产主义的协作风气大大发扬。
    据新华社8日讯　新华社记者田林综述当前工业战线上增产节约群众运动新高潮的形势：自从中共八届八中全会提出反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的号召以来，工业战线上就开展了一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动，掀起了一个新的生产高潮，出现了全线沸腾的形势。这一次增产节约群众运动新高潮的特点非常鲜明：第一，来势猛、规模大，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实；第二，效果显著，生产节节上升，打破了月初松月末紧的“常规”；第三，高产和优质、低耗、安全同时并进；第四，共产主义的协作风气大大发扬。
    在7月底8月初党中央提出反右倾鼓干劲的号召后，全国各地就分别召开了动员大会、广播大会、比武大会、跃进誓师大会等各种会议，接着各地就大搞评比，插红旗，树标兵，开展了厂际竞赛、同工种竞赛、对口竞赛、标兵赛、红旗赛、对手赛等各种竞赛，掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮。这一次的增产节约群众运动，很快就席卷了全国二十几个省、市和自治区。所有重工业部门，轻工业部门，交通运输部门，重点企业和非重点企业的职工，差不多都卷入了运动。到8月下旬，中央关于开展增产节约运动的决议发表后，广大职工群众又为在今年提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标和提前在十年左右赶上英国的号召所鼓舞，运动就如火如荼地开展起来，在9月份全面形成高潮。
    这一次增产节约运动新高潮的效果十分显著。8月份工业总产值就比7月份增长近14％，9月份又比8月份增长27％以上，达到今年以来的最高水平。1至9月累计，工业总产值已比去年同期增长45.5％。在六十种主要产品中，8月份比7月份增产的就有五十种，9月份比8月份增产的又有五十四种。钢，8月份比7月份增长13.5％，9月份又比8月份增长20％，相当于1952年全年的生产水平。生铁，8月份比7月份增长7.3％，9月份又比8月份增长25％，超过了1952年全年的产量。煤炭，8月比7月增长11.5％，9月又比8月增长18％。轻工业、纺织工业的生产也有很大提高，9月份，消费资料产值比8月份增长26.9％，其中棉纱增长14.2％、胶鞋增长22.1％，卷烟增长百分之百。
    在这一次的增产节约运动新高潮中，许多企业打破了月初松月末紧的“常规”，使生产节节上升。如钢和生铁9月上旬就比8月下旬分别增长8％—11％，发电量，9月上旬也比8月下旬增长约二百万度。北京市过去上旬完成全月产值三分之一的情况很少，而9月上旬就完成33.5％。齐齐哈尔机车车辆厂8月上旬只制成货车五十二辆，而9月上旬就制成了八十五辆。虽然国庆节放了三天假，但是10月初的生产情况也很好。9月份是重庆市钢铁产量最高的一个月，但是10月头五天的产量又比9月平均日产量增长，计钢增长1.77％，生铁增长28％以上，钢材增长27％以上。
    这一次增产节约运动新高潮的效果，不仅表现为高产，而且表现为优质、低耗和安全全面开花。8月份，十八个重点钢铁企业的生铁、电炉钢、转炉钢的合格率都有所提高，抚顺、阜新、大同等十九个单位原煤的灰分和含矸率都有所降低，上海、青岛、西安、郑州等地的棉纱和棉布的一等品率也有所提高。新闻纸、水泥袋纸的质量更有显著的提高。据二十多个重点市统计，9月上、中旬和8月比较，废品率都有下降，计铸铁件由11.1％降为9.4％，铸钢件由10.5％降为9.3％，机械加工件由2.5％降为1.6％。上海大达电机厂变压器的合格率由1月至5月的67％提高到97％。钢铁工业，8月份十八个重点企业每炼一吨铁耗用焦炭比7月份降低2.4％。电力工业，每度电标准煤耗8月份比7月份降低0.6％。9月份，煤炭工业的坑木消耗，织布、卷烟和化工厂的原料材料消耗量都有降低。
    在这次高潮中，共产主义协作的风气不仅在企业内部比较普遍地发扬，而且在企业和企业之间，产业和产业之间，部门和部门之间，都比过去有很大的发扬。最近出现的厂矿、铁路、港口、船舶和商业部门的“一条龙大协作”，就是一种明显的例证。
    这一次增产节约运动新高潮，来势如此之猛，效果如此之大，是有许多原因的。
    首先，最根本的原因是八中全会关于反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的号召，使广大干部和职工群众受到了极大的鼓舞，一部分干部中存在的右倾松劲情绪得到了克服，因而生产上的许多关键问题迅速得到了解决。如南京石门坎钢铁厂的洗煤炼焦问题，过去由于少数干部强调困难，喊了三个月都没有解决，反右倾后，三天就解决了。又如四川省乐山钢厂批判了车间主任认为最高日产量只能达到六十五吨的保守畏难思想后，第二天产量就上升到七十三吨，现在已经达到一百吨以上了。
    其次，发展了去年工业战线上大搞群众运动的经验，普遍实行了“两参一改三结合”的办法，并在放手发动群众的同时，加强了企业管理和运动的组织工作。许多企业的领导干部都深入车间和小组劳动，使领导和群众结合得更紧密。上海市许多企业都组成“三结合”小组，包干解决各种关键问题。抚顺新丘矿原来安排生产计划时，认为矿源不够，差十八万吨，这一次经过矿的领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合，下去找矿源，结果还能超产十万吨。武钢原来矿石供应不上，运动开始后，副总经理带头上山，切实解决了生产中的关键问题，矿石日产量就由8月上旬的三千吨逐步提高到六千七百多吨。各地在运动中，普遍注意了抓日进度和抓措施，因而运动开展得既热烈又踏实。上海市的红旗竞赛中，厂与厂，车间与车间，小组与小组，个人与个人进行了对口挂钩，不仅比先进、学先进、赶先进，而且帮助和鼓舞落后的赶上先进的。河北省抽出三千五百人，按行业组成一百四十个组，进行了竞赛的检查、评比和总结。陕西省通过报纸树立了三个红旗小组，另外还派出了由先进人物组成的标兵团或标兵组到各地传授经验。
    再次，职工群众普遍把苦干和巧干结合起来，开展了技术革新活动，推广了先进经验。如沈阳市电工局所属各厂从8月1日到25日，就实现技术革新建议四百九十六件，创造价值四十四万多元，节约金属材料五十一吨、燃料五万多吨。郑州纺织机械厂铸工车间推广了泥型铸造法，使工作效率提高五倍多；这个厂的木工车间把手压刨改成电动刨以后，效率提高了十倍。这个厂1月至7月一共只生产清花机和浆纱机三百六十七台，而8月份由于技术革新开展得好，就生产了三百七十台。北京第一机床厂改进刀具使产量提高了四倍，改进模具使效率提高了十一倍，大冶钢厂转炉车间把风口改为马蹄型后，平均每天就多炼四炉到六炉。
    从各地情况看来，目前运动还在向着更广更深的方向发展。可以想见，更大更多的成绩还会接踵而来。
