Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Ma Jinde, a woodworker from the Nanjing Military Supply Factory of the People's Liberation Army and a delegate invited to attend the National Congress of Heroes, has, through arduous struggle and repeated improvements, created more than ten kinds of mechanized tools such as electric planers, electric chisels, and double-wheel automatic sawing machines, mechanizing 70% of the woodworking tasks. This has greatly increased work efficiency. Compared with the past when all operations were manual, he can now complete the work volume of the past twenty years in one year.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Ma Jinde has had more technological innovations and inventions. For example, the double-wheel automatic sawing machine he made allows people to walk away after placing the wood on the machine table, and the machine operates automatically. With the strong support of the Party committee and the enthusiastic help of old workers from the machinery and electrical departments, Ma Jinde and the woodworking team, after three to four months of hard work, successfully produced an electric planer, which increased work efficiency fifty times compared to manual planing. Under the slogan of "Arming ourselves and achieving woodworking mechanization," they also manufactured three-dimensional grinding wheel saw sharpeners, horizontal and vertical electric drills, as well as wood lathes, and automatic screw installers. Now, most of the work in the woodworking group has been replaced by machines.

Encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, Ma Jinde is also actively researching and manufacturing an electric chisel, which has been basically completed after several revisions.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 23rd: He Chengqin, a young milling worker from the Harbin No. 2 Machinery Factory, and Luan Shuwei, his former female apprentice, have recently been selected as delegates to attend the National "Congress of Heroes."

He Chengqin, a seventh-grade milling worker, and Luan Shuwei, a second-grade milling worker, are producing in shifts on the same machine tool. They dare to think and dare to act, and engage in technical innovation in a big way. The master and apprentice competed and helped each other in the labor competition, and made progress together. From January to September this year, He Chengqin completed five years and seven months of work; during this period, Luan Shuwei also completed four years and four months of work.

In February this year, He Chengqin proposed a personal Great Leap Forward plan to do four years of work in one year at the Harbin Model Worker Conference. When Luan Shuwei, a nineteen-year-old female milling worker, heard this, she thought that Master He was highly skilled, how could she compare with him! But she also thought that she was a Communist Party member, and she could not lag behind in building socialism, so she bravely proposed a personal Great Leap Forward plan to do four years of work in one year. After that, in the competition, they both focused on technological innovation in every processing task. They also learned from industrial pacesetter and milling worker Su Guangming in Harbin City, learning six kinds of advanced tools, using more than ten kinds of advanced domestic and foreign cutting tools, and learning the operating methods of advanced producers from other places, operating three indigenous milling machines at the same time. In nine months, He Chengqin innovated more than 20 technical items, increasing efficiency from one to nineteen times; with He Chengqin's help, Luan Shuwei also created two kinds of tools, increasing efficiency six times. Both of them achieved their personal Great Leap Forward plans in August this year, and then proposed to do two more years of work in the fourth quarter.

    马进德实现木工机械化
    何承勤师徒双双进北京
    据新华社23日讯　应邀出席全国群英会的代表、人民解放军南京军需工厂木工马进德，经过艰苦奋斗、反复改进，创造了电刨子、电凿、双轮自动锯木机等十多种机械化工具，将70％的木工活实现了机械化。使工作效率大大提高。同过去全部手工操作时比较，现在一年能完成过去二十年的工作量。
    去年大跃进以来，马进德有了更多的技术革新和发明创造。如他制作的双轮自动锯木机，只要把木料放到机台上，人就可以走开，由机器自动操作。在党委大力支持和机器、电工部门的老工人的热情帮助下，马进德和木工组经过三、四个月的艰苦奋斗，制作成功了电刨子，比用手工刨木料提高工作效率五十倍。他们在“自己武装自己，实现木工机械化”的口号下，还制造了立体砂轮鎈锯、平电钻和立电钻、以及木车床、自动安装螺丝器等。现在，木工组的绝大部分工作已由机器代替了人手。
    在党的八中全会决议鼓舞下，马进德又积极研究制造一部电凿，经过多次修改，现已基本制造成功。
    据新华社哈尔滨23日电　哈尔滨第二机械厂青年铣工何承勤和他原来的女徒工栾淑伟，最近都被选为出席全国“群英会”的代表。
    七级铣工何承勤和二级铣工栾淑伟是在同一台机床上倒班生产的。他们敢想敢干，大搞技术革新，师徒俩在劳动竞赛中又赛又帮，共同跃进。何承勤在今年1月到9月里，完成了五年零七个月的工作量；栾淑伟在这期间也完成了四年零四个月的工作量。
    今年2月间，何承勤在哈尔滨市劳模会上，提出今年一年干四年活的个人跃进规划。十九岁的女铣工栾淑伟听到后，心想何师傅技术高，怎能和他比呢！但是她又想到自己是个共产党员，建设社会主义不能落后，于是也勇敢地提出一年干四年活的个人跃进规划。以后，他们俩在竞赛中，在每一项加工活上都琢磨着革新技术。他们又拜师访友，在哈尔滨市工业标兵、铣工苏广铭那里学来了六种先进工具，运用中外先进刀具十多种，并且学习了外地先进生产者的操作方法，一人操纵了三台土铣床。何承勤在九个月里，革新技术二十多项，提高效率一倍到十九倍；栾淑伟在何承勤帮助下，也创造了两种工具，提高效率六倍。两人在今年8月份就实现了个人跃进规划，接着又提出在第四季度再做两年的工作量。
