Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st. According to reports in the newspapers here today, Chairman Ho Chi Minh recently attended the Ninh Binh Province Winter-Spring Production Mobilization Conference and gave instructions to the conference representatives.

He pointed out the great political and economic significance of the 1959-1960 winter-spring production. He emphasized that in formulating planned targets, it is necessary to follow the mass line and transform the determination of the Party and the government into the determination of all cadres and the masses.

He then said that to do a good job in this winter-spring production, we must firmly remember and earnestly do the following eight points: sufficient water, abundant fertilizer, deep plowing, good seeds, appropriate close planting, pest and rodent control, improved farm tools, and strengthened field management. With these eight points, the granaries of grain and cotton crops are sure to be full.

When talking about the struggle between the two roads, Chairman Ho Chi Minh used concrete examples from the Soviet Union and China to point out that only by taking the road of collective production can we permanently escape poverty.

He taught cadres that they should clearly explain to the peasant masses what the two roads are, and should educate and help the peasants step by step from the shallow to the deep to gradually raise their socialist consciousness. At the same time, efforts must be made to increase the income of cooperative members, so that the income of members after participating in the cooperative is more than the income before participating in the cooperative, using such practical results to prove the superiority of the cooperative.

He also emphasized that it is necessary for the whole people to unite, to carry out the competition of increasing production and practicing economy, and to carry out the competition of building socialism and realizing a unified country. We must actively and steadily develop the Party and the Labor Youth League. Cadres, party members, and league members must play an exemplary leading role in all work.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st. Currently, tens of thousands of cadres and farmers in the northern Vietnamese provinces of Son Tay, Ha Dong, Thai Binh, Phu Tho, Hung Yen, Vinh Phuc, etc., are working day and night with soaring enthusiasm and high morale, carrying out drought resistance struggles and launching water conservancy construction movements.

Since September, the above-mentioned areas have successively experienced drought, which has seriously threatened the late rice that has already flowered and headed.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest of the promising late rice, the local Party committees and governments issued fighting calls to cadres and farmers, and leaders at all levels personally went to the countryside to guide drought resistance and rice rescue. The broad masses of farmers put forward the heroic slogan of "fighting drought is like fighting fire" and "not letting an inch of land suffer from drought", bravely fighting against natural disasters.

In Ha Dong Province, nearly 15,000 hectares of late rice were affected by drought. Thanks to the timely mobilization of the people of the province by the provincial Party committee to participate in the drought resistance struggle and the rational regulation of water consumption, the drought has been basically relieved. The people of Thanh Oai District in this province, after seven days of hard work, irrigated 2,000 hectares of land.

Many places in Vinh Phuc Province, in conjunction with the cooperativization movement, launched a vigorous drought resistance struggle. In the vast fields, thousands of troops and horses repair dikes every day, striving to draw and scoop water, thus alleviating the drought threat to most of the rice fields.

In order to overcome the drought and store water for winter-spring production, various places are fiercely attacking the water conservancy barrier. Thai Binh Province decided that from now until December, in addition to the local small-scale water conservancy projects built by the villages, the province will also dredge 170,000 cubic meters of silt from river channels and channel mouths. Many villages in the counties of Duyen Ha and Tien Hai in this province vigorously built water conservancy projects and achieved good results, and a large area of late rice grew full of grains.

    胡志明主席向越南农民发出号召
    搞好今冬明春生产力争粮棉作物满仓
    广大农民干劲冲天奋勇抗旱确保晚稻丰收
    新华社河内21日电　据这里报纸今天报道，胡志明主席最近参加了宁平省今冬明春生产动员大会，并向大会代表们作了指示。
    他指出1959—1960年冬春生产在政治和经济上的重大意义。他强调说，在制定计划指标时必须走群众路线，必须把党和政府的决心变为全体干部和群众的决心。
    他接着说，要搞好今冬明春生产，就必须牢牢记住和切实做好下列八条：水要足，肥要多，深耕，良种，适当密植，除虫灭鼠，改良农具，加强田间管理。作好这八条粮棉作物一定满仓。
    在谈到两条道路斗争的问题时，胡志明主席以苏联和中国的具体的例证，指出了只有走集体生产的道路才能永远摆脱贫困。
    他教导干部应当向农民群众解释清楚什么是两条道路，应当由浅入深地教育和帮助农民逐步提高社会主义觉悟。同时必须努力设法增加社员的收入，使社员在参加合作社后的收入都比未参加合作社时的收入多，用这样的实际结果来证明合作社的优越性。
    他还强调必须全民团结，进行增产节约竞赛，进行建设社会主义和实现统一国家的竞赛。必须积极和稳当地发展党和劳动青年团。干部、党员、团员必须在一切工作中起模范带头作用。
    新华社河内21日电　目前越南北方的山西、河东、太平、富寿、兴安、永福等省成千上万的干部、农民，正以冲天的干劲和昂扬的斗志，夜以继日地进行抗旱斗争和开展兴修水利运动。
    9月以来，上述地区先后发生旱象，使已经扬花抽穗的晚稻受到严重威胁。
    各地党委和政府为了确保丰收在望的晚稻，向干部、农民发出了战斗的号召，同时各级领导干部亲自下乡指导抗旱救稻。广大农民提出了“抗旱如救火”、“不使寸土受旱”的豪迈口号，对自然灾害奋勇斗争。
    河东省有将近一万五千公顷晚稻受旱，由于省委及时动员全省人民投入抗旱斗争，并合理调节用水量，旱象已经基本解除。这个省的清威县人民经过七天苦战，使二千公顷田地得到了灌溉。
    永福省许多地方结合合作化运动，展开了声势浩大的抗旱斗争。在广阔的田野上，每天都有千军万马大修堤埂，奋力车水、戽水，因此，解除了大部分稻田所受的干旱威胁。
    为了战胜干旱，并为冬春生产贮水，各地猛攻水利关。太平省决定，从现在到12月，除了各乡兴修地方小型水利工程外，全省还要疏浚河道和渠道口的泥沙十七万土方。这个省的沿河、前海等县许多乡大力兴修水利，收得了良好效果，大片晚稻因而长得颗粒饱满。
