　　The Immortal Achievements of the Interplanetary Station
　　The Soviet Union launched its third cosmic rocket, sending out an automatic interplanetary station. This messenger exploring the moon had already passed the closest point to the moon on October 6, circled the moon, and continued to operate according to its predetermined orbit. On October 10, it reached the apogee of its orbit, 470,000 kilometers from the Earth's surface, and began to turn back towards Earth, passing 40,000 kilometers from the Earth's surface on October 18. The lunar envoy revealed the secrets of the far side of the moon that humans had never seen! The Chinese people, along with progressive people and all fair-minded scientists around the world, warmly congratulate the Soviet people, Soviet scientists, and engineering technology experts for making unprecedented and enormous contributions to human history in the exploration of the universe.
　　Three weeks after launching its second cosmic rocket, the Soviet Union successfully launched its third cosmic rocket. This fact has forced those American politicians who once deliberately spread the rumor that "the Soviet Union's achievements in space exploration are nothing more than a coincidence" to shut up. People all over the world have clearly seen that the Soviet Union has accumulated a strong potential for exploring the universe. Powerful and precise rockets are large and numerous, ensuring that Soviet science can stride towards the magnificent goal of conquering the universe in accordance with careful and practical plans. Every step in this regard marks a significant improvement in the Soviet Union's theoretical and technical level in rocket operation. The third cosmic rocket had to circle the moon and return to the Earth region, which is much more difficult than passing through the lunar region or hitting the moon. This not only requires precise calculation of the rocket's theoretical orbit based on the three high-speed moving objects of the Earth, the Moon, and the rocket, as well as the gravitational forces of the Earth and the Moon on the rocket's operation, but also requires ensuring that it can enter the predetermined orbit technically. That is to say, the rocket's speed cannot have an error of more than five parts per ten thousand, and the take-off time cannot differ by a few seconds, so that the rocket can approach the moon without being sucked away by the moon, or exceeding the moon's gravitational pull and being sucked away by the sun's gravity, and precisely circle the moon in the gravitational forces of the moon, the sun, and the earth and fly back to the Earth region.
　　The third cosmic rocket and the automatic interplanetary station it launched strictly followed the predetermined orbit and sent back valuable data regularly under the command of the ground, which also showed that it has a very complete automatic control system and remote control system. The automatic navigation system on the rocket can automatically correct the speed and direction of the rocket through the motion parameters measured by itself and through a fast ultra-small computer. At the same time, it can also be corrected through the remote control device on the ground to ensure that the rocket enters the orbit accurately. The complex scientific instruments carried by the interplanetary station continuously measure day and night, and transmit various scientific intelligence back according to ground signals through precise and perfect radio equipment. The Soviet Union can conduct radio measurement and radio communication hundreds of thousands of kilometers away. This rapid development of remote control technology is an extremely important prerequisite for the future establishment of interstellar science stations and interstellar travel.
　　The launch of the third cosmic rocket shows that the Soviet Union has reached levels never before reached by mankind in three aspects: the theory of cosmic space science, rocket propulsion technology, and automatic control technology. It can be said without exaggeration that Soviet science and technology have opened the road to the universe. According to the level reached by Soviet science and technology, it will not be long before cosmic rockets are launched to explore more distant planets such as Mars and Venus.
　　People all over the world cheer that the interplanetary station has gloriously completed the task of further exploring the moon. It circled the moon and sent back to Earth valuable data on the far side of the moon, materials on the shape of the moon, and the distribution of matter inside the moon, greatly enriching human knowledge about the moon and creating conditions for landing on the moon in the future. Not only that, but this lunar envoy continued to follow an elliptical orbit with a major axis of more than 400,000 kilometers after circling the moon, operating in the vast sky between the Earth and the Moon. Its long-term collection of scientific intelligence in such a vast range in cosmic space will undoubtedly make immeasurable contributions to opening up human horizons, expanding scientific knowledge of interstellar physics, and future human spaceflight.
　　It has only been two years since the Soviet Union sent the first artificial satellite into the sky on October 4, 1957. In such a short period of time, the Soviet Union has launched three artificial Earth satellites, each heavier than the last, and each with higher scientific value. This New Year, Soviet science and technology mastered the second cosmic velocity and sent cosmic rockets into space, adding a new star to the solar system. A few months later, on September 12, the Soviet Union launched its second cosmic rocket, opening the door to the lunar palace and completing the first flight from Earth to another celestial body. Only three weeks after the launch of the lunar rocket, the Soviet Union sent the third cosmic rocket, the last stage of which was 42 kilograms heavier than the second, into space, completing an epoch-making feat in the history of conquering the universe. This shows that the Soviet Union has transitioned from experimental launches to planned research and conquest of the universe on the road to marching towards the universe. At what speed has Soviet science and technology leaped forward in the past two years! This speed is by no means obtained out of thin air, but is nurtured and grown in the socialist system.
　　But, how about the United States, the most developed capitalist country in the world? In the race to conquer the universe, the United States presented a scene of failure, chaos, and panic. Since August last year, the United States has been hyping up the launch of the "world's first" artificial lunar satellite, but four times in a row, these rockets either exploded or were burned down. Only in March of this year, two months after the launch of the first Soviet cosmic rocket, did the United States launch the "Pioneer 4" cosmic rocket, but the weight of its scientific instruments and containers was only 5.9 kilograms, and it passed through the lunar region 60,000 kilometers from the moon. Compared with the weight of 361.3 kilograms of the container carried by the first Soviet cosmic rocket, which passed through at a distance of more than 6,000 kilometers from the moon, it is really a small feat compared to a great one. After the second Soviet cosmic rocket sent the Soviet national emblem to the moon, the United States hurriedly wanted to use the "Atlas" rocket to launch a lunar satellite orbiting the moon. However, this rocket just didn't live up to expectations; before it could be launched, it exploded into pieces during a static test on the launch site.
　　What a stark contrast this is in the space exploration race! Facing the reality that American space exploration and rockets are far behind the Soviet Union, the "New York Times" lamented that this is due to the United States' "lack of first-rate scientists and engineers; lack of vision in formulating policies; friction and competition between the various military services and between military leaders and civil leaders; ideological opposition to effective government rocket research (represented by Braun and his group); and the secrecy of companies engaged in various aspects of research in this technology in order to compete." The phenomena mentioned by the "New York Times" do indeed exist. These things brought from the womb of capitalism are precisely the fatal weaknesses of the United States and all capitalist countries in the competition with socialist countries in science and technology.
　　Two years ago, the first Soviet artificial Earth satellite went into space, which was one of the main signs of the fundamental change in the strength of the two camps - the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The Soviet Union's achievements in rocket technology showed that the Soviet Union, the most developed country in the socialist camp, surpassed the United States, the most powerful country in the capitalist world, in the most cutting-edge science and technology. The "policy of strength" and "policy of deterrence" pursued by the United States with strategic air force and nuclear warheads have completely failed. Now, the United States has fallen further and further behind the Soviet Union in the theoretical and technical levels of propulsion rockets. Since the Soviet cosmic rocket can accurately hit targets 300,000 to 400,000 kilometers away, then which corner of the Earth cannot be hit? The planners of the "Cold War" policy cannot but retreat in the face of this ruthless fact. The situation of the East Wind growing stronger and the West Wind weakening has opened up new prospects for lasting world peace. However, imperialism is still imperialism and will never automatically lay down its butcher knife! While the United States is making some "easing" gestures in the West, isn't it also stirring up the civil war in Laos in the East, and isn't it also creating a "Tibet issue" in the United Nations to maintain the Cold War atmosphere and intensify international tension? This cannot but be guarded against. However, in any case, the general trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind cannot be changed. The forces for maintaining peace are stronger than ever before. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the monopoly capitalist groups in the United States to pursue their expansionist policies.
　　Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers have created and launched the third cosmic rocket and made outstanding contributions to mankind's cause of conquering the universe by establishing the interplanetary station. With their creative labor, they have once again shown the world the superiority of the socialist system, proving that as long as mankind gets rid of the shackles of the capitalist system and uses all its wisdom and energy to conquer nature, it will lead mankind to a bright future. The Soviet Union, the most powerful socialist country in the world, launched not only cosmic rockets on October 4, but also the dazzling brilliance of the socialist system, which attracts the attention of the world and illuminates the road for thousands of working people to move forward.

　　行星际站的不朽功勋
    苏联发射的第三个宇宙火箭，送出了自动行星际站。这个探索月球的使者，已经在10月6日，飞过接近月球的最近点，绕过月球，继续按照预定轨道运行，10月10日已经到达自己轨道的远地点，距离地球表面四十七万公里，开始朝地球折回，将在10月18日在距离地球表面四万公里处通过。探月使者揭开了人类从来没有看到过的月球背面的秘密！中国人民同全世界进步人类和一切公正的科学家一道，热烈庆贺苏联人民、苏联科学家、工程技术专家在探测宇宙方面所作出的人类历史从未有过的巨大贡献。
    苏联在发射了第二个宇宙火箭以后的三个星期，成功地发射了第三个宇宙火箭。这个事实，使那些曾经故意散布“苏联关于空间探测方面的成就，无非是碰巧而已”的美国政客们，不得不闭上嘴了。全世界人民都清楚地看到了，苏联为探测宇宙积蓄了雄厚的潜力，推力强大和精密的火箭又大又多，保证了苏联科学能够按照周密而切实的计划，大踏步地迈向征服宇宙的宏伟目标。在这一方面，每跨出一步，又都标志着苏联在火箭运行方面的理论水平和技术水平的显著提高。第三个宇宙火箭要绕过月球而返回地球区，这比经过月球区域或击中月球都要困难得多。这不仅需要按照地球、月球、火箭这三个高速度运动着的物体，以及火箭在运行中所受到的地球和月球的引力等等因素，来精确地计算出火箭的理论轨道，并且要在火箭技术上，保证它能进入预定轨道。也就是说，火箭速度不能发生超过十万分之五的误差，起飞的时间不能相差几秒钟，才能使火箭既接近月球，又不至为月球吸去，也不至超出月球的吸力被太阳的引力吸走，而恰恰能够在月球、太阳、地球三者的引力之中绕过月球飞回地球区。
    第三个宇宙火箭和它发射出去的自动行星际站，严格遵循预定轨道飞行，并且接受地面的指挥定时发回宝贵资料，这又表明了它具有十分完善的自动控制系统和遥远控制系统。火箭上的自动导航系统，可以通过本身测量的运动参数，通过快速超小型计算机，自动校正火箭的速度和方向，同时也可通过地面上的遥控装置加以校正，保证火箭精确无误地进入轨道。而行星际站携带的复杂科学仪器，昼夜不断地进行测量，通过精密完善的无线电设备，按照地面的讯号，定时地把各种科学情报发射回来，苏联能在数十万公里之外，进行无线电测量和无线电通讯。这种遥控技术的突飞猛进，对于今后建立星际科学站和星际旅行，都是极其重要的先决条件。
    第三个宇宙火箭的发射，表明了苏联在宇宙空间科学的理论、火箭推进技术和自动控制技术等三个方面，都达到了人类从来没有达到过的水平。可以毫不夸张地说，苏联的科学和技术，打开了通向宇宙的大道。按照苏联科学技术所达到的水平，发射宇宙火箭去探测火星、金星等更远的星球，已经为时不远了。
    全世界人民欢呼行星际站光荣地完成了进一步探测月球的任务，它绕过月球，把关于月球背面的宝贵资料、关于月球形状和月球内部物质分布情况的材料发回地球，大大丰富了人类关于月球的知识，为今后着陆月球创造了条件。不仅如此，这位探月使者绕过月球之后，继续循着轴长四十多万公里的椭圆形轨道，运行于地球和月球之间的广阔苍穹。它长期在宇宙空间中如此广阔的范围里搜集科学情报，无疑的，对于打开人类的眼界，扩大星际物理的科学知识和人类未来的宇宙飞行，将作出无可限量的贡献。
    自从苏联在1957年10月4日把第一个人造卫星送上天，至今不过两年。在这样短暂的时间内，苏联发射了三颗人造地球卫星，它们一个比一个重，科学价值也一个比一个高。今年新春，苏联科学技术掌握了第二宇宙速度，把宇宙火箭送上了太空，为太阳系增加了一颗新星。几个月后的9月12日，苏联又发射了第二个宇宙火箭，打开了月宫的大门，完成了从地球到另一天体的首次飞行。距离月球火箭的发射才三个星期，苏联又把最后一级比第二个还重四十二公斤的第三个宇宙火箭送上了太空，完成着征服宇宙史上划时代的创举，这表明了苏联在向宇宙进军的道路上，已经从试验性发射过渡到有计划地研究宇宙和征服宇宙的阶段了。苏联科学技术两年来是以怎样的速度飞跃前进的啊！这种速度绝不是凭空得来的，而是孕育滋长于社会主义制度之中。
    可是，看看世界上最发达的资本主义国家美国又如何呢？在征服宇宙的竞赛中，美国呈现了一幅失败、混乱和惊慌交织的情景。美国从去年8月就大吹大擂要发射“世界上第一个”人造月球卫星，但是连续四次，这些火箭不是爆炸便是焚毁。仅在今年3月，即在苏联第一个宇宙火箭发射两个月后，美国才发射了“先驱者四号”宇宙火箭，可是它的科学仪器和容器的重量只有五点九公斤，它飞过月球区域时距月球达六万公里。同苏联第一个宇宙火箭所带容器的重量三百六十一点三公斤，在距离月球六千多公里处通过比起来，真是小巫见大巫。当苏联第二个宇宙火箭把苏联的国徽送上月球之后，美国又慌里慌张地要用“阿特拉斯”火箭发射一个围绕月球转的月球卫星。但是，这个火箭偏不争气；没有等到发射，就在发射场上进行静止试验的时候炸个粉碎。
    在探测空间的竞赛中，这是一幅多么鲜明的对比啊！面对着美国空间探索和火箭方面大大落后于苏联的现实，“纽约时报”悲叹说，这是由于美国“缺乏头等的科学家和工程师；缺乏制定政策的远见；各军种之间和军界领导人同民政领导人之间的摩擦和竞争；对于政府的有效的火箭研究（以布劳恩和他的小组为代表）的意识形态上的反对；从事这门技术各方面研究的公司为了竞争而保守秘密”。“纽约时报”提到的这些现象倒是的确存在的。这些从资本主义娘胎里带来的东西，正是美国以至所有资本主义国家在科学技术方面同社会主义国家竞赛中的致命弱点。
    两年以前，苏联第一个人造地球卫星上天，是两大阵营力量的根本变化——东风压倒了西风的主要标志之一。苏联在火箭技术方面的成就，显示了社会主义阵营中最先进的国家苏联在最尖端的科学和技术方面，压倒了资本主义世界中最强大的国家美国。美国凭借战略空军和核弹头来推行的“实力政策”和“威慑政策”彻底破产了。而今，美国在推进火箭的理论水平和技术水平上，已经越来越远地落在苏联后面。苏联的宇宙火箭既然能够准确地击中三十几万到四十万公里以外的目标，那么，地球上还有哪一个角落不能击中呢？“冷战”政策的策划者们，在这一无情的事实面前，不能不却步了。东风日盛西风日衰的形势，为世界持久和平开辟了新的前景。但是，帝国主义终究是帝国主义，永远不会自动放下屠刀的！当美国在西方做出一些“缓和”姿态的同时，不是又在东方挑起了老挝内战，不又在联合国里制造什么“西藏问题”，来保持冷战气氛，加剧国际紧张局势吗？这是不能不加警惕的。但是，无论如何，东风压倒西风的大势是不可改变的了。维护和平的力量比过去任何时候都强大得多了。美国的垄断资本集团推行它们的扩张政策的困难越来越大了。
    苏联科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人们，创造和发射第三个宇宙火箭，建立行星际站的丰功伟绩，是对人类征服宇宙事业的卓越贡献。他们以自己创造性的劳动，向全世界又一次显示出社会主义制度的优越性，证明着只要人类摆脱了资本主义制度的束缚，把全部智慧和精力用到征服自然的事业上去，将会把人类导向何等美好的未来。苏联这个世界上最强大的社会主义国家10月4日发射的不单是宇宙火箭，而且是发射出社会主义制度夺目的光辉，它吸引着全世界的注意，它照亮着千千万万劳动人民前进的道路。
