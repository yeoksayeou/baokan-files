　　Why Adjust the Prices of Several Commodities?
　　By a Commentator of This Newspaper

　　Starting from the 10th of this month, the state has increased the purchase prices of agricultural products such as soybeans, peanut kernels, sugarcane, sugar beets, and beef cattle in some areas; it has also increased the sales prices of some soybeans, peanuts, soybean oil, and peanut oil. At the same time, the state has also reduced the tax rates on soybean oil and peanut oil; on October 1st, the state reduced the sales prices of two important drugs—penicillin and streptomycin. These measures are beneficial to promoting the development of production.
　　In recent years, the output of oil-bearing and sugar-bearing crops in our country has been increasing year by year. However, the rate of production growth still cannot keep up with the needs of the people's improving lives, and various measures must still be taken to further increase the production of these agricultural products. Of course, among the various measures, the main reliance is on the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, fully mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of farmers, planning planting areas, labor, and fertilizers in a planned way, strengthening guidance on production technology, summarizing and promoting high-yield experience, and striving to increase yield per unit area by every possible means. However, under the premise of maintaining basic price stability, correctly using the role of the law of value, and appropriately raising purchase prices to encourage farmers to increase the production of these commodities from the aspect of material interests is also beneficial and necessary.
　　This time, the substantial reduction in the sales prices of penicillin and streptomycin demonstrates the rapid development of China's pharmaceutical industry. This is a major victory achieved on the pharmaceutical industry front since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Now, China's production of penicillin and streptomycin can already guarantee self-sufficiency, and the supply volume has greatly increased compared to the past. At the same time, the production cost of these two drugs has also been greatly reduced. For the welfare of the broad masses of working people, the state can substantially reduce the sales prices. This is a happy event brought to the people by the Great Leap Forward, and we warmly congratulate the great achievements made on the pharmaceutical industry front.
　　This time, the adjustment of the prices of several agricultural products involves a greater increase in purchase prices and a smaller increase in the sales prices of oils and oilseeds. The sales prices of some commodities (such as sugar) have not been increased. This is a decision made by the state based on the principle of promoting production while minimizing the burden on the people as much as possible. We can see from the following accounts how the state considers the broad masses of people in every way. Due to the increase in the purchase prices of these agricultural products, coupled with the state's reduction of some tax rates, farmers can still increase their net income by more than 108 million yuan this year after deducting the increased portion of sales prices. Undoubtedly, this will further enhance the interest of farmers in increasing the production of these commodities. However, from the state's perspective, it will have to spend more on purchase funds and collect less tax revenue, totaling more than 122.2 million yuan. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately increase the sales prices of these commodities. Superficially, this seems to increase the burden on urban residents in some areas and farmers in areas that do not produce oil-bearing crops. However, because the increase in sales prices is small, the actual increase in expenditure for consumers is negligible. For example, the sales price of peanut oil has increased by an average of 7.97%, and people only spend four cents more to buy one catty of peanut oil. This can only make up for a portion of the difference in the state's purchase expenditures. It must also be explained here: the state's reduction in the sales prices of two drugs will reduce the expenditure of about 150 million yuan for the broad masses of urban and rural people in a year. If we look at the overall change in commodity prices, the people's living expenses will not increase, but will decrease somewhat. Moreover, from the long-term interests of the state and the broad masses of people, increasing purchase prices, promoting production, and increasing output can provide more non-staple foods for the market, which is beneficial to both the state and the people.
　　From here, we can see that every measure of the state will promote the construction of the motherland to achieve even more magnificent achievements at an accelerated pace, and every achievement of the motherland will bring greater happiness to the people. Let us summon greater enthusiasm and make production even better. In our country, every drop of sweat we shed is for ourselves and for our future.

　　为什么要调整几种商品的价格？
　　本报评论员
    从本月10日起，国家提高了大豆、花生仁、甘蔗、甜菜，以及一部分地区的菜牛等农产品的收购价格；也提高了一些大豆、花生、豆油、花生油的销售价格。与此同时，国家又降低了豆油、花生油的税率；10月1日，国家降低了两种重要药品——青霉素和链霉素——的销售价格。这些措施，对于促进生产的发展是有利的。
    几年来，我国的油料、糖料作物的产量是逐年提高的。但是，生产增长的速度，仍然跟不上人民生活提高的需要，还必须采取各种措施来促进这些农产品进一步增产。当然，在各种措施中，主要是依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发挥农民的劳动积极性，有计划地安排种植面积、劳动力和肥料，加强对生产技术的指导，总结和推广丰产经验，千方百计地提高单位面积产量等等。但是，在保持物价基本稳定的前提下，正确运用价值规律的作用，适当地提高收购价格，从物质利益方面来鼓励农民增产这些商品，也是有益的和必要的。
    这次大幅度地降低青霉素和链霉素的销售价格，说明了我国的制药工业有了飞速的发展，这是制药工业战线上在1958年的大跃进以来所取得的一项重大胜利。现在我国的青霉素和链霉素生产已经能够保证自给，在供应数量上比过去有了很大的增加，同时，这两种药品的生产成本也大大降低了，为了广大劳动人民的福利，国家就有可能把销售价格大幅度地降低下来。这是大跃进给人民带来的喜事，我们热诚祝贺制药工业战线上所取得的伟大成就。
    这次调整几种农产品的价格，收购价格提高得多，油脂、油料的销售价格提高得少，有的商品（如食糖）销售价格没有提高。这是国家根据促进生产同时又尽可能不加重人民负担的原则来决定的。我们可以从下面的几笔账里看到国家如何处处为广大人民着想。由于这几种农产品的收购价提高，再加上国家降低了部分税率，今年农民在扣除销售价提价部分外，还可以净增加收入一亿零八百多万元。无疑地，这将能够进一步提高农民增产这些商品的兴趣。但是，从国家这方面来看，就要多支出收购资金和少收进税款，这笔支出共计一亿二千二百多万元。因此有必要适当地提高这些商品的销售价格。从现象上来看，这对于有些地区的城市居民和不生产油料作物地区的农民似乎是增加了一些负担。但是，由于销售价格增长得少，实际上消费者增加的支出是微不足道的。如花生油的销价平均提高7.97％，人们购买一斤花生油，只不过多支出四分多钱。这只能弥补国家收购支出的差额的一部分。这里还必须说明：国家降低两种药品的销售价格，广大城乡人民在一年中大约减少一亿五千万元的费用支出。如果从整个的商品价格变动上看，人民的生活费用将不是增多，而是将会减少一些。而且，从国家和广大人民的长远利益来看，由于提高了收购价格，促进了生产，增加了产量，就能够为市场提供更多的副食品，这对国家、对人民都是有利的。
    从这里，我们可以看到：国家的每一个措施，都将促进祖国的建设事业加速取得更宏伟的成就，而祖国的每一个成就，都将为人民带来更大的幸福。让我们鼓起更大的干劲，把生产搞得更好。在我们的国家里，我们所流的每一滴汗，都是为了我们自己，为了我们的未来。
