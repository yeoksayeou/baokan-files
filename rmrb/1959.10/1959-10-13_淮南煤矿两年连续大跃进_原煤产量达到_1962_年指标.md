　　Huainan Coal Mine Achieves Continuous Great Leap Forward for Two Years
    Raw Coal Production Reaches 1962 Target
    (Our Dispatch) Huainan Coal Mine produced 10,027,830 tons of raw coal in the first nine months of this year, exceeding the Second Five-Year Plan's final year target of 9,150,000 tons of raw coal for 1962 three years and three months ahead of schedule, an increase of 80% compared to the same period in 1958.
    During last year's Great Leap Forward, the production and construction of the Huainan Coal Mine developed rapidly. The annual production of raw coal reached 8,170,000 tons, exceeding the state plan by 1,260,000 tons, and an increase of 66% compared to the raw coal production in 1957. In that year, the entire mine newly built and renovated eleven pairs of mine shafts, and carried out large-scale technical training work, creating good material and technical conditions for continuing the Great Leap Forward this year.
    This year, the mine formulated a Great Leap Forward plan to produce 14,000,000 tons of raw coal annually, an increase of 72% over the 1958 production. The mine party committee constantly educated the workers to boost their morale and continuously put forward new daily output targets. The broad masses of workers enthusiastically plunged into the red banner competition for large-scale high-yield, and the entire mine's production saw one upsurge after another. For example, with the mine's coal production in January taken as 100, it increased to 128 in April and then to 133 in July. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the morale of the broad masses of workers became even more vigorous. The mine party committee led the workers in making a thorough calculation of the mine's potential and explained to the workers the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties, putting forward the bold slogan of "Work hard for forty days, break through the thousand-ton mark, achieve safety and high yield, and dedicate a gift to National Day." In mid-August, the daily output reached 40,000 tons, and on September 18, it broke through the 50,000-ton mark. Throughout the latter half of September, the average daily output was above 50,000 tons.
    In this year's production, the Huainan Coal Mine also conscientiously implemented the policy of "walking on two legs." While tapping the potential of large mines, the entire mine had built a total of seventeen pairs of small coal mines by the end of September. The highest average daily output of these small mines reached more than 5,000 tons, and they produced a total of 650,000 tons of coal in nine months.

　　淮南煤矿两年连续大跃进
    原煤产量达到1962年指标
    本报讯　淮南煤矿今年前九个月生产原煤一千零二万七千八百三十吨，提前三年又三个月超额实现了第二个五年计划最后一年1962年生产原煤九百一十五万吨的指标，比1958年同期的产量增长80％。
    去年大跃进中，淮南煤矿的生产建设迅速发展，全年生产原煤八百一十七万吨，比国家计划超过一百二十六万吨，比1957年原煤产量增长66％。这一年，全矿新建、改建了十一对矿井，进行了大规模的技术培训工作，为今年继续大跃进创造了良好的物质技术条件。
    今年，这个矿制订了年产原煤一千四百万吨的大跃进的计划，比1958年的产量又提高72％。矿党委不断教育职工鼓足干劲，不断提出新的日产量指标。广大职工热烈投入大面积丰产红旗竞赛，全矿生产一个高潮接着一个高潮。如以全矿1月份产煤量为一百，4月份提高到一百二十八，7月份又提高到一百三十三。党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，广大职工斗志更加昂扬，矿党委领导职工大算矿井潜力账，向职工大讲克服困难的有利条件，提出了“大干四十天，突破千吨关，安全又高产，国庆把礼献”的豪迈口号。8月中旬，日产量达到四万吨，9月18日突破了五万吨大关，整个9月下旬，平均日产量都在五万吨以上。
    淮南煤矿在今年的生产中，还认真贯彻了“两条腿走路”的方针。在大挖大矿潜力的同时，全矿到9月底共建成了十七对小煤井。这些小井最高平均日产量达五千吨以上，9个月来，共生产煤炭六十五万吨。
