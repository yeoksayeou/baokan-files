Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 21st: On the eve of attending the National "Meeting of Heroes," the workers of the famous national red banner furnace – Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 Blast Furnace – once again displayed their skills and reached a new technological peak. In the first half of October, the average utilization coefficient of this blast furnace jumped from 2.193 in September to 2.335, setting the highest record in Anshan Iron and Steel's history. It also surpassed the level of Benxi Dongfeng No. 1 Blast Furnace, which won the national championship in September, for the first half of October, once again taking the lead among the nation's large blast furnaces. In the first half of the month, this blast furnace produced an additional 1,080 tons of high-quality pig iron for the country.

    After being named a collective representative to attend the National "Meeting of Heroes," the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 Blast Furnace were elated, their enthusiasm soared even higher, and they resolved to make even greater achievements to present as a gift to the National "Meeting of Heroes." After an intense battle to seize iron production, they achieved the above-mentioned outstanding results.

    Since July of last year, No. 9 Blast Furnace has been an advanced blast furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel. However, a year and a half ago, this blast furnace's production was the most backward among the ten large blast furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel; in March of last year, the utilization coefficient was only 1.348. Through the great nationwide rectification campaign and the implementation of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the workers of the entire furnace gradually established a communist style of daring to think and daring to act. On the basis of close unity and unified operational thinking, they humbly and creatively learned from the operational experience of Benxi ironworkers in simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, and implemented a series of technological innovations. Therefore, since July of last year, the utilization coefficient has rapidly increased, overfulfilling the state plan every month, and it has stepped into the ranks of the advanced blast furnaces in the entire plant. By April of this year, the utilization coefficient broke through the "2" mark, and in May it rose to 2.187, reaching the level of advanced blast furnaces in the world. This major production achievement of No. 9 Blast Furnace powerfully shattered the conservative thinking that the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces is difficult to reach above "2", and enhanced people's confidence in climbing to higher technical levels.

    The journey of No. 9 Blast Furnace workers on the road of production leap forward was not always smooth sailing. Since the signing of the red banner competition contract between No. 9 Blast Furnace, No. 3 Blast Furnace, and Benxi Dongfeng No. 1 Blast Furnace in April of this year, a fierce competition of catching up with each other has unfolded. In May and June, the utilization coefficient of No. 9 Blast Furnace broke through the "2" mark and took the lead in the country continuously. However, after their victory, some people developed complacency, relaxed their efforts in the face of difficulties, and as a result, they did not continue to leap forward. On the other hand, its competitors, full of enthusiasm, quickly caught up, and their production rose sharply. In July and August, No. 3 Blast Furnace repeatedly surpassed No. 9 Blast Furnace and Benxi Dongfeng No. 1 Blast Furnace and won the national championship; in September, Benxi Dongfeng No. 1 Blast Furnace surpassed No. 3 Blast Furnace and won the national championship. No. 9 Blast Furnace lost the red banner for three consecutive months. Under the call and encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they criticized complacency and laxity, and the workers of the entire furnace worked together with greater enthusiasm, humbly learning from the experience of fraternal blast furnaces, and as a result, production rose sharply from late September, once again creating outstanding results.

### 再创利用系数全国纪录  鞍钢九号高炉更上一层楼

    再创利用系数全国纪录
    鞍钢九号高炉更上一层楼
    新华社鞍山21日电　在出席全国“群英会”的前夕，著名的全国红旗炉——鞍钢九号高炉职工又大显身手，登上新的技术高峰。10月份上半月，这座高炉的平均利用系数由9月份的二点一九三跃到二点三三五，创造了鞍钢有史以来的最高纪录，也赶过了9月份获得全国冠军称号的本溪东风号高炉10月上半月的水平，再次在全国大型高炉中领先。上半月，这座高炉已经为国家多生产了优质生铁一千零八十吨。
    鞍钢九号高炉最近被评为出席全国“群英会”集体代表以后，全炉职工欢欣鼓舞，干劲更加昂扬，决心作出更大成就向全国“群英会”献礼。经过一场激烈的夺铁战斗，创造了上述的优异成绩。
    九号高炉从去年7月份起，一直是鞍钢的先进高炉。但是，在一年半以前，这座高炉在鞍钢十座大型高炉中生产还是最落后的，去年3月利用系数只有一点三四八。经过伟大的全民整风运动和贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，全炉职工逐步树立了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，在紧密团结和操作思想统一的基础上，虚心地、创造性地学习了本溪炼铁工人提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作经验，实现了一系列的技术革新。因此，从去年7月份起利用系数就迅速提高，月月超额完成国家计划，跨上了全厂先进高炉的行列。到今年4月间，利用系数突破“二”的大关，5月份又上升到二点一八七，达到了世界先进高炉的水平。九号高炉这一生产上的重大成果，有力地击破了所谓大型高炉利用系数很难达到“二”以上的保守思想，增强了人们攀登更高技术水平的信心。
    九号高炉职工在生产跃进的道路上并不是一帆风顺的。今年4月间，九高炉、三高炉和本溪东风号高炉签订红旗竞赛合同以来，展开了激烈的你追我赶的竞赛。5、6两个月，九号高炉的利用系数都突破“二”的大关，连续在全国领先。但是，他们在胜利之后，由于有些人产生了自满情绪，在困难面前松了一把劲，结果没有继续跃进；而它的竞赛对手却干劲十足地急起直追，生产扶摇直上。7、8两月，三号高炉连连赶过九号高炉和本溪东风号高炉而荣获全国冠军；9月份，本溪东风号高炉又赶过三号高炉而荣获全国冠军。九号高炉先后三个月失去了红旗。他们在党的八届八中全会的号召鼓舞下，批判了自满松劲情绪，全炉职工同心同德鼓起更大干劲，虚心学习兄弟高炉的经验，因而生产从9月下旬起猛烈上升，再次创造了出色的成绩。
