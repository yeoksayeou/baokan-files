　　阿尔巴尼亚果木繁茂
    两年来平均每人增加果树十株
    新华社地拉那电阿尔巴尼亚正在大力发展果木栽培业。目前，劳动人民正在把山丘变为果园，把自己的国家变为水果之乡。
  近两年来，阿尔巴尼亚的果树栽培获得了新的发展，全国共栽种了一千四百多万株果树，二百多万株橄榄树，并且扩大了五千三百八十七公顷葡萄园。仅仅在最近两年内增加的果树，如按人口平均计算，每人就有差不多十株果树，一株以上橄榄树；不到二百八十个人就有一公顷葡萄园。
    阿尔巴尼亚气候条件很好，全国近三万平方公里的土地几乎都适合栽植各种果树，尤其是柑桔和橄榄。
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚的水果栽培获得了巨大的成就，目前果树比战前增加了七倍，橄榄树增加了70％，葡萄田也扩大了73％。
