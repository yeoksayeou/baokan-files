Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th: Hebei Province held an on-site meeting in Changli County from October 5th to 12th to introduce and promote Changli County's experience in organizing a "complete chain" of production, transportation, and sales through extensive collaboration. The meeting called on workers on the province's transportation front to launch a movement to vigorously promote transportation collaboration, further tap transportation potential, accelerate vehicle and cargo turnover, strive to complete this year's transportation plan half a month ahead of schedule, and prepare conditions for continued great leaps forward in the first quarter of next year and throughout the year.

Changli County's experience of "complete chain" collaboration in production, transportation, and sales involves using the station as a material collection and distribution center. Through the close connection of long-distance and short-distance transportation, modern and traditional transportation tools, and professional and mass transportation, the industrial, commercial, and grain departments, along with the railway, highway, and handling services, are integrated into one. This ensures that each link on the transportation front progresses rhythmically. This resolves the contradictions between railway transportation and private vehicle transportation, long-distance and short-distance, and loading/unloading and driving, greatly strengthening the planning, accuracy, and balance of transportation work, increasing transportation capacity, and accelerating cargo turnover. This year, without increasing transportation equipment or manpower, Changli County's railway freight volume from January to August increased by 80% compared to the same period last year, and highway freight volume increased by 1.4 times.

Strengthening Party leadership and adhering to putting politics in command is one of the main experiences of Changli County in organizing the "complete chain" collaboration of production, transportation, and sales. In the process of organizing collaboration among various departments, the county Party committee frequently uses the mass line method, continuously fighting against various forms of departmentalism through extensive airing of views, debates, and big-character posters. This establishes a "one chessboard" mentality. Workers in production, transportation, and sales departments extensively engage in collaborative competition, jointly striving to shorten the stay time of vehicles and goods at the station. This year, the loading and unloading time for railway vehicles has been shortened from 7.6 hours last year to 2.8 hours. Automobiles average 4,400 ton-kilometers per month, an increase of 20.27% compared to last year. Handling and loading/unloading workers take advantage of the few tens of minutes when empty vehicles from Tianjin to Shenyang stop to replenish water, engaging in rapid loading operations. From January to September, a total of more than 1,600 railcars of various materials were transferred out, accounting for 41% of the total materials transferred out.

Establishing appropriate collaborative organizational forms and management systems is also an important part of doing a good job in collaboration between production, transportation, and sales departments and fully utilizing the potential of transportation equipment. Based on unified thinking and according to the specific circumstances, Changli County formed a "complete chain" joint office consisting of the industrial, commercial, and grain departments that consign more goods, as well as the railway, highway, and handling systems that undertake transportation. It established a new management system, so that the transportation and consignment departments could work together in practical work. This ensured unified transportation planning and unified dispatch of transportation equipment and forces. In this way, all links on the transportation front can be closely connected and cooperate with each other, increasing the driving time of various vehicles and accelerating the turnover of materials. In completing transportation tasks, it can both guarantee key priorities and take care of general needs. In addition, it is very convenient for cargo owners to handle consignment and pickup procedures. With just one phone call, handling workers come to the door to transport the goods to be sent or deliver the picked-up goods to their homes.

After introducing experiences and visiting the site, the representatives unanimously believed that Changli County's organization of "complete chain" collaboration in production, transportation, and sales has found an extremely important way to complete the current heavy transportation tasks. Therefore, they proposed to learn from Changli, catch up with Changli, surpass Changli, and vigorously promote the "complete chain" collaboration of production, transportation, and sales. Within October, hundreds of "dragons" will be formed along the province's railways, highways, and inland rivers, more closely connecting long-distance and short-distance transportation, modern and traditional transportation tools, professional and mass transportation, and production and sales departments, to ensure the completion of transportation tasks ahead of schedule.

　　河北省推广昌黎大搞短途运输的经验
    长途短途大协作　生产运销一条龙
    据新华社天津14日电　河北省10月5日到12日在昌黎县召开现场会议，介绍和推广昌黎县组织产、运、销“一条龙”大协作的经验。会议号召全省交通运输战线职工掀起一个大搞运输协作的运动，进一步挖掘运输潜力，加速车辆和货物的周转，力争提前半个月完成今年运输计划，并为明年第一季度和全年继续大跃进准备条件。
    昌黎县产、运、销“一条龙”大协作经验，就是以车站为物资集散中心，通过长途运输和短途运输、现代运输工具和民间运输工具、专业运输和群众性运输的紧密衔接，把工业、商业、粮食部门和铁路、公路、搬运组成一家，一环套一环，保证运输战线上各个环节有节奏地进行。这样，就解决了铁路运输与民间车辆运输、长途与短途、装卸和行车之间不协调的矛盾，大大加强了运输工作的计划性、准确性和均衡性，提高了运输能力，加快了货物的周转。今年以来，昌黎县在没有增加运输设备和人力的情况下，1月至8月与去年同期比较，铁路运量提高了80％，公路运量提高了一点四倍。
    加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是昌黎县组织产、运、销“一条龙”大协作的主要经验之一。在组织各部门协作过程中，县委经常运用群众路线的方法，通过大鸣大放大辩论，不断地同形形色色的本位主义思想作斗争，从而树立了“一盘棋”的思想，生产、运输和售销部门的职工广泛地开展了协作竞赛，共同为缩短车辆和货物在车站停留时间而奋斗。今年以来，铁路车辆装卸时间由去年的七点六小时缩短到二点八小时；汽车平均月产四千四百吨公里，比去年提高了20.27％。搬运、装卸工人利用天津到沈阳的排空车辆停站上水的几十分钟时间，大搞快装作业，1月至9月共调出各种物资一千六百多个车皮，占整个调出物资的41％。
    建立适当的协作组织形式和管理制度，也是搞好产、运、销部门之间的协作，充分发挥运输设备潜力的重要环节。在统一思想的基础上，昌黎县根据具体情况，把托运货物较多的工业、商业、粮食部门及承担运输的铁路、公路、搬运系统，组成“一条龙”联合办公室，建立了新的管理制度，使运输与托运部门在具体工作中拧成一股绳，因而作到了调运计划统一和运输设备力量调度统一。这样，运输战线上各个环节就能紧密衔接和互相配合，增加了各种车辆的行车时间，加速了物资的周转。在完成运输任务上，既能保证重点，又能照顾一般。此外，货主办理托运和取货手续十分简便，只要一个电话，搬运工人就找上门来把发送的货物运走，或者把提取的货物送到家来。
    经过介绍经验和现场参观，代表们一致认为昌黎县组织产、运、销“一条龙”大协作，为完成当前繁重运输任务找到了一个极其重要的途径，因而他们提出要学昌黎，赶昌黎，超昌黎，大搞产运销“一条龙”大协作。10月份内，全省铁路、公路、内河沿线将要组成数百条“龙”，把长途运输和短途运输、现代运输工具和民间运输工具、专业运输和群众运输，以及产、销等部门更加紧密地衔接起来，保证提前完成运输任务。（附图片）
