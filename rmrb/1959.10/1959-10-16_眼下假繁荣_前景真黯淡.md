Xinhua News Agency, October 14th, New York dispatch: The American Communist Party's "Political Monthly" in its September issue published a draft political resolution of the National Committee for discussion by all party members before the 17th National Congress of the American Communist Party, scheduled for December this year. The section on "Economic Situation" analyzes the current economic situation in the United States.

The draft resolution states that the American economy is now once again in the process of rising. Production and employment are increasing, and people generally expect a new prosperity. However, this upswing is built on an unstable foundation. The most significant feature of the American economy since the end of World War II has been its increasing instability. Since the end of World War II, there have been three "recessions," the third of which was the most serious. The price of recovery from each "recession" has been an increase in public and private debt, an increase in long-term unemployment, and other factors that contribute to more serious crises in the future. Although the current level of production and employment is high, looking ahead, the economy may once again fall into stagnation and decline within a year or two, and the poverty that the working people experienced in 1958 will descend again, and will be more serious.

In these three "recessions," especially in the most recent one, large companies used their economic power to maintain high monopoly prices and increased their profits by expanding automation and the speed-up system. Today, monopoly capital is constantly expanding its control over American economic life and its control in guiding government affairs. The accelerated merger of companies is increasingly concentrating economic and political power in the hands of monopoly capital, emphasizing the growth of state monopoly capitalism.

In order to cope with the increasingly fierce competition from other capitalist countries, large American companies are desperately suppressing wage levels in the United States, and are increasingly adopting the method of opening factories abroad. The products of these foreign factories are shipped back to the United States, resulting in a reduction in employment opportunities for American workers. The draft resolution states that for the working class, the main consequence of all this is increasing instability in life and a growing long-term and massive unemployment phenomenon. The current accelerated automation and factory relocation exacerbate this process, turning more and more important industrial centers into distressed areas with widespread long-term unemployment. In addition, since the federal, state, and local governments return part of the taxes they collect to large companies, the cost of these changes is mainly borne by the working people.

The draft resolution states that since the end of World War II, large companies have used the federal government to forcibly implement a war economy, stirring up anti-Soviet hysteria as a basis for maintaining cold war budgets and a nuclear arms race, and militarizing industry, science, and education. All this has become a means of plundering the federal treasury to enrich the private pockets of missile manufacturers, oil and chemical trusts, and other monopoly capital.

The cold war economy, agreed upon by both parties, has caused government debt at all levels to pile up. This puts a heavy interest burden on taxpayers, making the tax burden unbearable for the American people. The Cold War embargo has undermined foreign trade, causing American manufacturers to lose a lot of business, which has reduced employment opportunities for American workers. The draft resolution states that the constant flow of billions of dollars into the entirely wasteful war economy has largely contributed to inflation-like price increases, which hurt the working people, especially those families who live on fixed incomes. At the same time, due to the burden of the Cold War economy, allocations for social welfare such as housing, health, and education have been reduced accordingly; and many federal responsibilities have been transferred to the states and localities, which are unable to bear them.

For millions of small farmers, rising monopoly prices and the deterioration of Cold War inflation have narrowed the difference between their costs and revenues to almost zero. Thousands of small landowners and tenants have left the land. In the agricultural areas of the South and other regions, millions of Americans are suffering. The draft resolution calls on the American working class to fight for employment opportunities, to shorten working hours, and to greatly increase unemployment relief and other measures to protect unemployed workers. The draft resolution states that the basis for these struggles is the unity of workers, small farmers, blacks, and small business owners to fight against the economic fraud of the trusts.

### 眼下假繁荣  前景真黯淡

　　美共分析美国经济情况
　　眼下假繁荣  前景真黯淡
　　一两年内可能再次陷于停滞和衰落
　　工人大量长期失业  小农佃农备受苦难  政府债务高积如山  百姓负着捐税重担
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党“政治月刊”9月号刊载了全国委员会在定于今年12月召开的美国共产党第十七次代表大会以前提出供全体党员讨论的政治决议草案，其中“经济状况”一节分析了目前美国的经济情况。
    决议草案说，美国经济现在又一次处于上升的过程中。生产和就业人数正在增加，人们普遍预料会出现新的繁荣。但是这种高涨是建立在不稳定的基础上的。战后美国经济最显著的特点是不稳定性日益严重。第二次世界大战结束以来，已发生了三次“衰退”，其中以第三次最为严重。每次“衰退”复元的代价都是公私债务增加，长期失业人数增加，以及构成以后发生更严重的危机的其他因素。尽管目前的生产水平和就业人数是高的，但是展望前景，在一、两年内经济可能再次陷于停滞和衰落，劳动人民在1958年所遭遇的贫困将再度降临，而且将更严重。
    在这三次“衰退”中，特别在最近一次“衰退”中，大公司利用自己的经济力量维持了高昂的垄断价格，并通过扩大自动化和赶快制度来增加自己的利润。今天，垄断资本正在不断扩大对美国经济生活的控制以及在指导政府事务方面的控制。公司的加速合并，正在使经济及政治力量愈来愈集中在垄断资本的手中，并着重说明了国家垄断资本主义的增长。
    为了应付其他资本主义国家的日益激烈的竞争，美国大企业正在拚命压低美国国内的工资水平，同时正在愈来愈多地采取在国外开设工厂的办法。这些国外工厂的产品重又运回美国，结果减少了美国工人的就业机会。决议草案说，对工人阶级说来，所有这一切的主要后果是生活日益不安定，长期的大量失业现象日益严重。目前的加速自动化现象和工厂迁移的现象使这个过程更形恶化，结果把愈来愈多的重要工业中心变成普遍出现长期失业的困难地区。此外，由于联邦政府、州政府和地方政府把敛得的税的一部分又还给了大公司，所以负担这些变动的费用的主要还是劳动人民。
    决议草案说，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，大企业一直利用联邦政府来强制实行战争经济，煽起反苏歇斯底里作为维持冷战预算和核军备竞赛的根据，并且使工业、科学和教育实行军事化。这一切成了掠夺联邦的国库来中饱导弹制造商、石油和化学托辣斯和其他垄断资本的私囊的手段。
    两党一致同意的冷战经济使各级政府的债务高积如山。这使沉重的利息的负担落在纳税人的身上，使美国百姓纳税的担子重得难以负担。冷战禁运破坏了对外贸易，使美国制造商丧失去了大量的生意，结果也就减少了美国工人的就业机会。决议草案说，亿万美元不断流入全属浪费的战争经济一事，在很大程度上促成了通货膨胀性质的物价上涨，而受害的是劳动人民，特别是那些靠固定收入为生的家庭。同时，由于冷战经济的负担，房屋、卫生、教育等等社会福利的拨款就相应减少；而且联邦的许多责任转移给州和地方，而州和地方却无力负担。
    对千百万小农民说来，垄断价格的上升和冷战通货膨胀的恶化使他们的成本和收益之间的差额几乎缩小到等于零。成千成万的小土地所有者和佃农纷纷离开了土地。在南部农业区和其他地区，千百万美国人备受苦难。决议草案号召美国工人阶级为争取就业机会，争取缩短工作时间并且大大增加失业救济金和其他保护失业工人的措施而斗争。决议草案说，进行这些斗争的基础是：工人、小农、黑人和小企业者团结起来对托辣斯的经济欺诈进行斗争。
