    A gathering of one thousand people from all walks of life in the capital was held this afternoon to warmly welcome the representative of the fighting Cameroonian people - Mr. Moumie, Chairman of the Cameroonian People's Union, and listened to his report on the struggle of the Cameroonian people against colonialism.

    When Mr. Moumie, accompanied by Burhan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, and others, stepped onto the rostrum, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly, expressing their lofty respect and brotherly support for the Cameroonian people who are engaged in a heroic struggle against colonialism and for national independence.

    In his welcome speech, Burhan emphasized that the common cause of opposing imperialism and colonialism closely links the Chinese people and the Cameroonian people. The Chinese people, with the deepest sympathy, have always resolutely supported the struggle of Cameroon and all African people for national independence and freedom. Burhan said that Mr. Moumie's visit to China will further promote the friendship between the Chinese people and the Cameroonian people. He also wished the Cameroonian people an early victory in their struggle.

    Mr. Moumie then spoke amid warm applause. He said with confidence that with the strong support of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the Cameroonian people will surely be able to achieve complete liberation and win the victory against imperialism and feudalism, just like the Chinese people.

    Moumie then condemned the imperialist aggression in Asia and Africa. He pointed out that the US imperialist plot to turn Cameroon into a US military base will surely fail. He also condemned the United Nations for becoming a tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. He said that the United Nations recently discussed the so-called "Tibetan issue," which is purely China's internal affair, and said that "human rights" had been violated. But at the same time, countless men, women, and children in Cameroon and Algeria are being massacred by foreign colonialists, and the United Nations has not intervened in this colonialist atrocity.

    Moumie then introduced the Cameroonian People's Union's leadership of the Cameroonian people in their struggle for independence and against colonialism. He said that the struggle of the Cameroonian People's Union has received the support of all the Cameroonian people, and the people are determined to get rid of the imperialist occupation and live a happy and free life. He pointed out that the revolutionary struggle waged by the Cameroonian people is also a social revolution for women's liberation, an economic revolution to get rid of poverty and backwardness, and a cultural revolution. This revolutionary struggle will surely be victorious with the support of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    Finally, the Chairman of the Cameroonian People's Union said that the struggle of the Cameroonian people and the African people against imperialism is also the struggle of the people of all countries, because as long as colonialism exists, the world cannot achieve true peace. Today, the African people have awakened, and there is no force in the world that can stop them from moving forward. The African people will surely win the victory against colonialism, and Africa will finally achieve true liberation.

    Mr. Moumie's speech was repeatedly supported by warm applause from the audience.

    Among those present at today's meeting were the heads of various people's organizations, including Li Dequan, Ding Xilin, Zhang Xiuzhu, Chen Hansheng, Qu Tangliang, Zhu Ziqi, and Wang Mingyuan.

    The Cameroonian Women's Delegation headed by Madame Carmen Monique, who is currently visiting our country, and other Cameroonian friends in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting.

    喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃在首都各界欢迎会上说
    喀麦隆人民反帝斗争一定胜利
    包尔汉强调中国人民支持喀麦隆的斗争
    新华社29日讯　首都各界一千人今天下午举行集会，热烈欢迎战斗的喀麦隆人民的代表——喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃先生，并且听了他作的关于喀麦隆人民反对殖民主义斗争的报告。
    当穆米埃先生由中国亚非团结委员会副主席包尔汉等陪同登上主席台的时候，会场上全体起立，热烈鼓掌，向反对殖民主义、争取民族独立而进行英勇斗争的喀麦隆人民，表示崇高的敬意和兄弟般的支持。
    包尔汉在致欢迎词中强调指出：反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同事业，把中国人民与喀麦隆人民紧紧地连在一起。中国人民怀着最深厚的同情，一贯坚决支持喀麦隆和所有非洲人民争取民族独立与自由的斗争。包尔汉说：穆米埃先生这次访问中国将会进一步促进中国人民和喀麦隆人民的友谊。他并且预祝喀麦隆人民的斗争早日取得胜利。
    穆米埃先生接着在热烈的掌声中讲话。他满怀信心地说，喀麦隆人民在中国人民和全世界人民的大力支持下，一定能和中国人民一样，得到彻底的解放，取得反对帝国主义、反对封建主义的胜利。
    穆米埃接着谴责了帝国主义在亚洲和非洲的侵略活动。他指出，美帝国主义企图把喀麦隆变成美国军事基地的阴谋行动必将遭到失败。他还谴责联合国已经成为美国干涉他国内政的工具。他说，联合国最近讨论了纯粹是中国内政的所谓“西藏问题”，并且说成是“人权”受到了侵犯。但在同一时候，喀麦隆和阿尔及利亚的无数男女老少正遭受着外国殖民者的屠杀，联合国对这种殖民主义暴行却没有加以干预。
    穆米埃接着介绍了喀麦隆人民联盟领导喀麦隆人民争取独立和进行反对殖民主义斗争的情况。他说，喀麦隆人民联盟的斗争得到了全体喀麦隆人民的支持，人民决心摆脱帝国主义的占领，过幸福自由的生活。他指出，喀麦隆人民进行的革命斗争也是一次争取妇女解放的社会革命，争取摆脱贫困、落后的经济革命和文化革命。这个革命斗争在中国人民和全世界人民的支持下，一定会取得胜利。
    喀麦隆人民联盟主席最后说，喀麦隆人民和非洲人民反对帝国主义的斗争，也是各国人民的斗争，因为只要有殖民主义存在，世界就不可能得到真正的和平。今天，非洲人民已经觉醒起来，世界上已经没有任何力量可以阻挡他们前进。非洲人民一定能够取得反对殖民主义的胜利，非洲也将终于获得真正的解放。
    穆米埃先生的讲话一再得到全场的热烈鼓掌支持。
    出席今天大会的，有各人民团体的负责人李德全、丁西林、张修竹、陈翰笙、区棠亮、朱子奇、王明远等。
    正在我国访问的以卡门·莫尼克夫人为首的喀麦隆妇女代表团和在北京的其他喀麦隆友人应邀出席了大会。
