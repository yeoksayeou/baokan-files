　　The US Steelworkers' Strike and New Anti-Labor Laws

　　The Longest Steel Strike Since the War

    The US Steelworkers' strike, which began on July 15th of this year, has lasted for more than two months. The strike has surpassed the 54-day steel strike of 1952, becoming the longest of the six steel strikes since the war. US monopoly capitalists have refused the striking workers' reasonable demands for wage increases and are coercing workers to accept unreasonable conditions proposed by the capitalists. At the same time, they are using Congress to revise labor laws and intensify their attack on the entire labor movement. The passage of the new labor law has made the struggle more intense and strained. However, the heroic struggle of the steelworkers is not isolated, and they continue to persist in their struggle with the enthusiastic support of other brother unions. Although the strike has been undermined by the US President's use of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law on the 9th, it has already had a significant impact on the domestic political and economic life of the United States.

    The more than two months of strike struggle fully demonstrate that the US monopoly capital and the government's intention is to strengthen the exploitation of the working class and undermine the growing labor movement. Long before the expiration of the steel industry's labor-capital contract, steel companies made strike preparations in production. After labor and capital began negotiations, the capitalists and the government massively propagated the lie that raising wages would cause prices to rise and used this as an excuse to unreasonably reject the steelworkers' reasonable demands. The capitalists also proposed continuing to freeze workers' wages for one year and eight conditions for amending the contract, the essence of which was to abolish the union's right to restrict capitalists from intensifying workers' labor intensity. The capitalists could arbitrarily punish striking workers, dismiss workers without prior notice, and restrict workers' vacations. Now, when the capitalists' so-called "raising wages will cause prices to rise" "reason" has been thoroughly refuted, the capitalists have blatantly stated that they will not increase wages unless the workers accept the capitalists' conditions.

    The Essence of the New Anti-Labor Law

    Not only that, but US monopoly capital also used Congress to formulate laws to crack down on the labor movement. On August 6th, Eisenhower, on the pretext of union "extortion, corruption, and abuse of power," demanded the accelerated revision of labor laws, and said that "for two years, [he has] been advocating the formulation of such laws." The "Labor Reform Act" passed by Congress was officially signed and approved by President Eisenhower on September 14th. This is the largest amendment since the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which cracked down on unions and the labor movement. The main contents of the revised so-called "Labor Reform Act" are as follows: (1) Unions must submit complete financial reports to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor has the right to disclose these materials to the capitalists. The Secretary of Labor has the right to investigate any union's files or file a lawsuit with the court if he is not satisfied with the report. (2) Union members have the right to file lawsuits against those who work for the union, and the expenses are borne by the union. This gives the union's spies the power to sabotage the union. (3) The Secretary of Labor has the right to determine union election regulations, revoke elections or order re-elections through court rulings. (4) State governments have the right to handle labor disputes that the National Labor Relations Board refuses to accept. This gives state governments the power to sabotage unions. (5) Prohibits unions from enjoying certain legitimate rights to fight against capitalists. Obviously, US monopoly capital directed its government to accelerate the implementation of the new reactionary labor law and strengthen government control over unions. Its intention is to suppress the rising labor movement and launch a comprehensive attack on the working class.

    Monopoly Capital Intensifies its Attack on the Labor Movement

    The comprehensive attack launched by US monopoly capital on the working class is not accidental. It is a manifestation of intense class struggle. As early as 1947, the US government formulated the Taft-Hartley Act, which stipulated that capitalists have the right to participate in union elections, capitalists can hire workers who do not participate in unions, sign contracts with any worker group separately, and that Communists and other progressive people are not allowed to participate in union work, etc., in order to allow capitalists to interfere in union affairs, alienate worker unity, and make unions lose their correct direction. In the past two or three years, the government has vigorously promoted the so-called "right to work law," in the name of protecting "workers' rights," prohibiting unions from organizing strikes, and undermining union activities.

    In recent years, the US business community has generally promoted "automation" and the "speed-up system," increased workers' labor intensity, and laid off workers in large numbers in order to extract high profits. Although the economic crisis of 1957-1958 has passed, the economic outlook is not stable. All of these have cast a shadow of possible unemployment at any time on employed workers. Therefore, the demand for reduced working hours, full pay, and job security has become a common demand of workers. Secondly, in last autumn's elections, the majority of workers expressed their dissatisfaction with the Republican Party's domestic and foreign policies and voted for the Democratic Party, which greatly increased the Democratic Party's seats in Congress, and since then, the American labor movement has begun to become active again. According to the Labor Department, a total of 1,975 strikes occurred in the United States in the first half of this year, with 850,000 people participating in the strikes, resulting in a loss of 12.5 million workdays. In the same period last year, there were 1,688 strikes, with a loss of 7.12 million workdays. The Labor Department admitted that the scale of the strikes in the first half of this year exceeded any same period in the past four years. All of the above has caused alarm and unease among the American ruling group. Therefore, during the tense stage of the steel strike, the new anti-labor law was hastily passed to suppress the labor movement.

    The Working Class Strengthens Unity and Morale

    But in the face of the monopoly groups and the government's attack, the American steelworkers are in high spirits and persist in the struggle. They have pointed out to Steelworkers Union President McDonald that if he compromises with the capitalists, he should not think about being the union president again. Many Democratic Party members who were elected to Congress last year because of labor support voted in favor of amending the labor law in this Congress. This shameless act completely violated the promises they made to the workers in last year's election and greatly angered the majority of workers, reducing their illusions about the Democrats. The president of the International Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers Union, in a letter to members of Congress, strongly condemned the shameful behavior of the Democrats and pointed out that in the next election, labor will do its utmost to defeat those who voted in favor. In the struggle, the unity of the American working class has been strengthened. Many fraternal unions have taken the defense of labor rights as their own task and have launched activities to support the steelworkers. According to a recent report by the US Department of Labor, in addition to the 500,000 steelworkers on strike, workers in 30 large and small industries such as lead, zinc, copper, docks, and shipyards are currently participating in the strike. The total number of strikers has reached 613,000. The American Communist "Workers' Weekly" has repeatedly called on workers across the country to support the steelworkers, and recently called on labor to unite and oppose the new labor law. The AFL-CIO Executive Council also held a meeting on August 20th, stating that the American labor movement guarantees to support the steelworkers' struggle, and called on the AFL-CIO's 13.5 million members to "join hands and unite with brother members in the steel industry" and "give full moral and financial support to the striking workers." It also decided to designate Labor Day on September 7th as "Support Steelworkers Day" and launch support activities. In its call to affiliated union organizations, the New York Labor Council pointed out: "Our labor movement is at a time of serious danger," "The strike of 500,000 steelworkers is not only for wage increases, but also to defend their unions against monopoly enterprises that deliberately destroy unions." These situations show that any measures taken by the ruling class to strengthen the oppression and exploitation of the working class will only arouse increasingly strong resistance from the majority of workers, and will only strengthen the workers' unity and fighting will.

    Tearing Apart the False Mask of "Freedom to Strike"

    The impact of the steel strike on the US economy has also begun to become apparent. The industrial production index (1947-1949 = 100) has fallen from 155 in June before the strike to 149 in August. Currently, weekly steel production is only about 330,000 tons, a weekly reduction of about 2 million tons, and the operating rate is only about 12% of the total production capacity. Some construction projects have begun to be suspended due to a shortage of steel. The US auto industry has felt the pressure of a lack of steel, and some auto companies' factories will be shut down due to a lack of steel or to save steel. The production of major metals fell by 25% in July compared to June, the metal production index fell from 150 to 113, and the fuel index fell from 144 to 137. According to the Labor Department, manufacturing deliveries and new orders also began to decline in July, and manufacturing sales also decreased compared with the previous month. Overall, the steel strike has affected the US economy, although it is not yet serious. It is generally estimated that steel stocks will be exhausted in October. Therefore, if the steel strike continues, the impact on the US economy will definitely be more significant.

    It can be seen that this steel strike in the United States has had a significant impact, causing the US monopoly groups to fear the strength of the US working class. The US government is now impatiently following the will of the US monopoly capitalists and using anti-labor laws to force the steelworkers, who have persisted for nearly three months, to return to work. Spokespersons for the US ruling group have repeatedly and plausibly used the US steelworkers' strike as proof that the United States has democracy and freedom. Nixon also boasted that Americans have "the freedom to strike for wage increases or improved working conditions" and touted it as America's "spiritual and moral property." Now Eisenhower has disregarded the face of the vice president and ordered a forced return to work, exposing the Nixon types' flowery words about America's "democracy and freedom." It turns out that the United States only has the democracy and freedom of the monopoly capitalists. As soon as anyone violates the interests of the capitalists, the money-grubbing plutocrats have long discarded the fig leaf of "democracy and freedom."

　　美国钢铁工人大罢工和新的反劳工法
　　洁美
　　战后历时最长的钢铁大罢工
    今年7月15日开始的美国钢铁工人大罢工迄今为止已经坚持两个多月了。罢工时间之长已经超过1952年为期五十四天的钢铁大罢工，成为战后六次钢铁大罢工中最长的一次。美国垄断资本家一方面拒绝罢工工人提出的增加工资的合理要求，并要挟工人接受资方提出的无理条件；另一方面又通过国会修改劳工法，加紧对整个工人运动展开进攻。新的劳工法的通过使斗争更为激烈紧张。但是，钢铁工人的英勇斗争并不是孤立的，他们在其他兄弟工会的热烈支持下，继续坚持斗争。现在，罢工斗争虽然由于美国总统于9日运用塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法加以破坏，但它对美国国内的政治和经济生活已经产生了不小的影响。
    两个多月来的罢工斗争充分说明，美国垄断资本和政府的企图是，加强对工人阶级的剥削，破坏日益发展的工人运动。早在钢铁业劳资合同期满以前，钢铁公司就在生产上作了罢工准备。劳资双方开始谈判之后，资方和政府又大肆宣传提高工资将造成物价上涨的谎言，并借此无理拒绝钢铁工人的合理要求。资方还提出继续冻结工人工资一年和修改合同的八点条件，其实质在于取消工会限制资方加强工人劳动强度的权利，资方可以对罢工工人任意惩罚，无须事先通知即可解雇工人并且可以限制工人假期。现在，当资方的所谓提高工资会造成物价上涨的“理由”被彻底驳斥以后，资方就赤裸裸地表示，除非工人接受资方的条件，否则就不增加工资。
    新的反劳工法的实质
    不仅如此，美国垄断资本还利用国会，制订法律打击工人运动。8月6日，艾森豪威尔借口工会“敲诈勒索，贪污腐化，并且滥用职权”，要求加速修改劳工法，而且说“两年来，一直主张制订这样的法律。”国会通过的“劳工改革法”已由艾森豪威尔总统于9月14日正式签字批准。这是自从1947年制订打击工会和工人运动的塔夫脱—哈特莱法以来最大的一次修改。修改后的所谓“劳工改革法”的主要内容有以下几点：（1）工会必须向劳工部长提出完整的财政情况报告，劳工部长有权向资方透露这些材料，劳工部长对报告不满意时有权调查任何工会的档案或向法庭提出控诉。（2）工会会员有权对做工会工作的人提出控诉，费用由工会负担。这就使得工会里的坐探有破坏工会的权力。（3）劳工部长有权确定工会选举条例，通过法院判决来撤销选举或命令改选。（4）州政府有权处理全国劳工关系委员会拒绝接受的劳工纠纷。这就使州政府也有了破坏工会的权力。（5）禁止工会享有同资方进行斗争的某些正当权利。显然，美国垄断资本指使它的政府加速实施新的反动劳工法，加强政府对工会的控制，其用意在于镇压日益高涨的工人运动，向工人阶级展开全面的进攻。
    垄断资本加紧进攻工人运动
    美国垄断资本向工人阶级展开全面的进攻不是偶然的。它是阶级斗争剧烈的表现。早在1947年美国政府制订了塔夫脱—哈特莱法，该法规定资本家有权参加工会选举，资方可以雇用不参加工会的工人，同任何工人集团单独签订合同，不许共产党和其他进步人士参加工会工作等等，以便让资本家干涉工会事务，离间工人团结，使工会失去正确方向。近两三年来，政府又大力推行所谓“工作权利法”，以保护“工人权利”为名，禁止工会组织罢工，破坏工会活动。
    近年来，美国企业界普遍推行“自动化”和“赶快制度”，增加工人劳动强度，大量解雇工人，以榨取高额利润。1957—1958年经济危机虽已过去，但经济前景并不稳定。所有这些都向在职工人投下了随时可能失业的阴影。因而要求减少工作时间、工资照发和保障就业已经成为工人普遍的要求。其次，去秋选举中，广大工人表示出对共和党对内、对外政策的不满，纷纷投了民主党的票，使民主党在国会中的席位大大增加，而且从那时起，美国工人运动重新开始活跃起来。据劳工部宣布，今年上半年美国共发生了一千九百七十五次罢工，参加罢工的有八十五万人，损失一千二百五十万个劳动日。而去年同期罢工次数为一千六百八十八次，损失七百十二万个劳动日。劳工部承认今年上半年的罢工规模超过四年以来的任何同一时期。以上种种，都引起美国统治集团的惊慌不安，因而在钢铁大罢工紧张阶段，匆忙通过新的反劳工法，以镇压工人运动。
    工人阶级团结加强斗志昂扬
    但是在垄断集团和政府的进攻面前，美国钢铁工人斗志高涨，坚持斗争。他们已经向钢铁工会主席麦克唐纳指出，假如他同资方妥协，以后就别想再当工会主席。许多去年国会改选中因得到劳工支持而当选的民主党议员在本届国会里纷纷投票赞成修改劳工法。这种无耻行径完全违背了他们在去年选举中向工人所作的诺言，极大地激怒了广大工人，减少了他们对民主党人的幻想。国际电器、无线电和机器业工会主席在给国会议员的一封信里，强烈谴责民主党人的可耻行为，并且指出，在下届选举中，劳工将全力击败那些投赞成票的人。在斗争中，美国工人阶级的团结加强了。许多兄弟工会都把保卫劳工权利当作自己的任务，纷纷展开支援钢铁工人的活动。据美国劳工部最近报道，除五十万钢铁工人罢工以外，目前参加罢工的还有铅、锌、铜业、码头、船坞等大小三十个行业的工人。罢工总人数已达六十一万三千人。美共“工人周刊”曾一再号召全国工人支援钢铁工人，最近又号召劳工团结一致，反对新的劳工法。劳联—产联执委会也于8月20日举行会议，表示美国劳工运动保证支持钢铁工人的斗争，并且号召劳联—产联一千三百五十万会员“同钢铁工业中的兄弟会员携手团结”，“对罢工工人给予道义上和财政上的全力支持”。并决定9月7日的劳工节为“支持钢铁工人日”，展开支援活动。纽约劳工理事会在发给所属工会组织的号召中指出：“我国劳工运动正处在严重危险的时期”，“五十万钢铁工人的罢工，不仅为了增加工资，而且是为了反对蓄意破坏工会的垄断企业，以保卫他们的工会”。这些情况表明，统治阶级任何加强对工人阶级压迫与剥削的措施只会引起广大工人日益强烈的反抗，只会加强工人的团结和斗争意志。
    撕破了“罢工自由”的假面具
    钢铁罢工对美国经济的影响也已经开始显露出来。工业生产指数（以1947—1949为100）已经从罢工前6月份的155下降到8月份的149。目前每周钢产量只有三十三万吨左右，每周约减产二百万吨，开工率仅及总生产能力的12％左右。有些建筑工程由于缺少钢材而开始停工。美国汽车工业已感到缺乏钢铁的压力，很多汽车公司的部分工厂将因缺乏钢铁或节约钢铁而停工。主要金属的生产7月份比6月份下降25％，金属产量指数从150下降到113，燃料指数从144下降到137。另据劳工部报告，7月份制造业交货量和新订货也开始下降，制造业售货量也比上个月有所减少。总的看来，钢铁罢工已经对美国经济发生影响，虽然还不算严重。一般估计，10月份钢的存货将耗尽。因此，如果钢铁罢工继续下去，美国经济所受的影响一定会更加显著。
    由此可见，美国这次钢铁大罢工已经发生了重大的影响，引起美国垄断集团对美国工人阶级力量的恐惧。美国政府现在迫不及待地秉承美国垄断资本家的意志，运用反劳工法强迫使坚持近三个月的钢铁工人复工。美国统治集团的代言人曾经振振有词地一再把美国钢铁工人罢工作为美国有民主、有自由的证明。尼克松也吹嘘美国人有“为了增加工资或改善劳动条件而罢工的自由”，并把它标榜为美国的“精神和道义财产”。现在艾森豪威尔竟顾不得副总统的面子了，下令强迫复工，揭穿了尼克松之流的所谓美国有“民主自由”的花言巧语。原来，美国有的只是垄断资本家的民主和自由，谁只要触犯了资本家的利益，利欲熏心的财阀们早就把“民主自由”这块遮羞布丢置脑后了。
