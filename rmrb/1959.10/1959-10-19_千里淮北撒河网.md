Spreading a River Network Across Thousands of Li in Northern Anhui
By Our Reporter Yú Míng

    Northern Anhui: Then and Now

    Thousands of li of plains, as beautiful as brocade.
    New rivers, alongside smooth highways, are filled with green water and teeming with geese and ducks. In many places, rice paddies are connected, forming a dense river network. Countless windmill wheels, driven by the wind, resemble blooming lotuses dancing in the air, harmonizing with the water dragons below.

    Members of the Feihui People's Commune in Bengbu can now take small boats from their villages to the fields for work, using the boats to transport fertilizer, tools, and harvested crops through the river network. Standing on their boats, the commune members joyfully sing: "In the past, we carried it on our shoulders; now, we float on the water. When a breeze comes, we cross our arms."

    The Zilu Lake Brigade of the Sanba People's Commune in Sixian County has transformed the former barren lake and swamp area into a newly built garden with the help of the river network. Many trees are planted on the embankments every less than a li apart, and the commune members manage these riverside gardens with cleanliness and care. The entire brigade, with four thousand people, raises 150,000 fish in the river network and has planted two million fruit trees on the embankments. Wooden signs erected on the embankments express the beautiful wishes of the people of Northern Anhui: "This place will become a green corridor, evergreen in all seasons," and "This place will become scenic, with abundant fruit trees."

    So many people in Northern Anhui have developed a deep affection for the shimmering waters of the river network. In the past, Zilu Lake was flooded every year, and a folk song circulated: "Girls don't marry into Zilu Lake, and men don't want to return to their hometown." But now, with the construction of the river network, girls from other places have fallen in love with this place and with the young men here. In the Chen Jia Ke's family, two sons married girls from other places who came to build the river within a year. Chen Jincheng, seventy-three years old, only ended his life of wandering after the construction of the river network, returning to his hometown and living a happy old age, no longer fearing disasters. In Suixi, I saw many elderly people who had wandered in Jiangnan before liberation praising the river network as if they were mad, asserting that Northern Anhui would definitely become Jiangnan.

    This is the new scene in Northern Anhui, which suffered a hundred days of extraordinary drought this year.

    Water has now turned into water conservancy, and the people of Northern Anhui love it. But in the past, when the people of Northern Anhui thought of water, they thought of disaster: With a heavy rain in autumn, overwhelming floods would roll in, instantly submerging fields of crops, collapsing houses, and causing clothes to float on the water. People climbed onto trees, crying for help. Landlords and bailiffs plundered in boats in the vast floodwaters, and hungry farmers drowned, swallowed by the waves. After the water receded, there were refugee crowds everywhere, the wilderness was overgrown with weeds, and corpses emitted a foul smell, a scene of desolation!

    This was the tragic scene in Northern Anhui for eight hundred years before liberation. Starting in 1194, during the Song Dynasty, when the Yellow River changed its course for the fourth time, the Jin people exploited river flooding to harm the people. Later, through the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, the feudal rulers, in order to maintain north-south water transport and extort wealth from the people, continued to force the Yellow River to flow south against the current, causing the river channels in Northern Anhui to become silted and elevated, hindering drainage. In the eighteen years from the eighth to the twenty-fifth year of the Ming Dynasty's Hongwu reign alone, the Huai River basin suffered from the Yellow River breaching its banks eight times. The Fengyang Flower Drum song, "Since the advent of Emperor Zhu, there have been nine years of famine in ten years," reflects this severe disaster. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they only used the diversion of the Huai River as a pretext to extort wealth, but in fact, not only did they not implement it, but in 1938, they inhumanely destroyed the southern embankment of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, causing 890,000 people in Northern Anhui, Henan, and Northern Jiangsu to die, and more than six million people to be displaced. After that, there were disasters every year, lasting for nine years. How could the people of Northern Anhui, who had been devastated by this destructive disaster for eight hundred years, not fear floods like ferocious beasts?

    The Party's Water Management Thought Has Triumphed

    Generation after generation, the people of Northern Anhui sang: "Fathers hope, mothers hope, only hoping that the Huai River will not flood, that a great savior will appear one day to cure the Huai River and bring peace to the people." The people's hopes were finally realized after liberation.

    In 1950, the great call was issued, and Chairman Mao said: "We must harness the Huai River well." The people of Northern Anhui and people from all over the country devoted themselves to the Huai River harnessing movement. Every year, hundreds of thousands to millions of people camped in the Dabie Mountains and on the Huai River, launching a struggle against nature.

    Reservoirs such as the Foziling and Meishan Reservoirs in the Dabie Mountains and flood storage projects on both banks of the Huai River can hold back 10 billion cubic meters of water, increasing the flood discharge capacity of the Huai River by more than two times. By 1957, a preliminary drainage system had been built on the Northern Anhui Plain.

    However, even after controlling floods and sending the water away, waterlogging in Northern Anhui remained very serious. In 1952, when waterlogging was relatively light, the affected area was still over 10 million mu. How could Chairman Mao's call to harness the Huai River well be realized? The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China began to conduct in-depth investigations and research in 1951.

    Since the myth of Dayu dredging Longmen and draining the nine rivers, the methods of dredging and draining have dominated. Pan Jixun of the Ming Dynasty and Jin Fu of the Qing Dynasty also used this method to harness the Huai River. Sending away the floodwaters has become the tradition of water management in our country. After the liberation, when harnessing the Huai River began, although the central government had proposed the principle of "combining storage and discharge in the middle reaches of the Huai River, with storage as the main focus," some people still followed the old tradition of water management. They believed that sending away the floodwaters and preventing the dikes from breaking meant that the task of harnessing the Huai River was completed. The Provincial Party Committee studied a large amount of historical data, which proved that the old traditional water management methods could not achieve the goal of fundamentally controlling the Huai River. In Northern Anhui, within two thousand years, there was an average of one disaster every two years, half of which were droughts and half floods. This proves that only draining water without storing it cannot solve the drought in Northern Anhui. There is a major flood every ten to thirty years, while there is a severe waterlogging disaster about every five years. This proves that waterlogging disasters are more serious than flood disasters, and it is one-sided to only pay attention to flood prevention and dike protection without paying attention to waterlogging control. At the same time, heavy rainfall in Northern Anhui is concentrated in July, August, and September. If the characteristics of the rainfall can be adapted to, and rice is planted to increase summer harvest crops, disasters can be avoided and harvests can be ensured.

    Based on the results of investigation and research, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the positive methods of "flood prevention and dike protection," "waterlogging control and harvest protection," and "changing planting to avoid disasters" in 1953. That is: adopt a water management policy focusing on eliminating waterlogging and protecting harvests, combined with flood prevention and dike protection. Waterlogging control projects should focus on water storage, and water storage should be carried out on a large plain, which can both eliminate waterlogging and prevent drought, and also reduce the threat of floods to the Huai River dikes. In terms of the farming system, the "three changes" were implemented: expanding the area of summer harvest crops, changing to planting high-yield and water-resistant crops such as rice, and changing the habit of extensive planting and low yield. By 1957, the area of summer harvest crops in Northern Anhui had expanded from 70% of the cultivated land area to more than 85%, and rice had also developed to nearly one million mu, greatly changing the habit of extensive planting and low yield, which played a great role in increasing production. However, because the struggle between the two thoughts in water management (storage-based or discharge-based) was not completely resolved, the policy of storing water for waterlogging control on a large area was not well implemented; at the same time, because the water source problem in Northern Anhui had not been well resolved, the work of changing to rice planting progressed relatively slowly.

    1957 was a year of great leap forward in water management projects. In this year, after rectification, the struggle between the two thoughts of water management was completely resolved. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee also personally went to Northern Anhui to investigate the situation of the masses digging deep ponds to use groundwater, proving that Northern Anhui has a large amount of groundwater that can solve the problem of rice irrigation and prevent drought and waterlogging. Based on the "three main" water management policy put forward by the central government, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the fighting program of "relying on the masses, believing in the masses, focusing on small-scale projects, supported by large and medium-sized projects, focusing on storage, minimizing discharge, river networkization, rice planting, and turning Northern Anhui into Jiangnan." From then on, the Party led the people of Northern Anhui to a more ideal state.

    According to the plan for the river networkization of Northern Anhui, it is necessary to open nine large rivers in the eighteen counties of Northern Anhui and intersect with the original fifteen rivers to form the main lines of the river network; between the large river networks, there are three to four kilometers of medium and small rivers in each square kilometer area, forming countless small networks, and connecting with the large river network; wells and springs are generally built under the river channels to store groundwater, surface runoff water, and external water. After the Northern Anhui river network stores water as much as possible, the water that needs to flow out will only be one-thirtieth of the flow in the past years of large floods, greatly reducing the burden on the main stream of the Huai River, and even if there is more rainfall than in 1954, flood disasters can be avoided. After a large amount of water is stored in the river network, more than half of the dry land will be converted to rice fields, and it will be guaranteed that there will be no drought for seventy days without rain, and the remaining dry land can also be irrigated. The realization of river networkization will make Northern Anhui the most developed place for water and land transportation. Large boats will reach every township, and small boats will reach every village; land transportation will also be accessible in all directions.

    After river networkization, Northern Anhui will be a place with extremely abundant aquatic products. According to Suixi County, which has built the most river networks and raised fish the earliest, each person in the county can be allocated at least 300 jin of fish next year. This alone can generate an income of 100 yuan per year per person. In addition, a large number of water chestnuts, lotus roots, and other aquatic plants and animals can be cultivated, and a large number of livestock and poultry such as chickens, geese, pigs, and ducks can be developed.

    Northern Anhui will become the best area for land landscaping. The river network is in a square grid shape, with a river every kilometer, and trees are planted on the dikes, forming countless square grid-shaped forest belts. The entire area of Northern Anhui will become shaded by green trees, with no sandstorms, a coordinated climate, moderate temperature, greening the land, protecting crops, with inexhaustible timber, and inexhaustible fruits. Northern Anhui will become a veritable large garden.

    The river network implements section-by-section interception and storage, and many control projects will establish hydropower stations. Northern Anhui will use cheap water transportation to transport coal, and will also build many thermal power plants, so that Northern Anhui will gradually embark on the road of mechanization and electrification.

    River networkization makes the people of Northern Anhui change from fearing water to loving water, and it is the victory of the Party's water management policy. River networkization is the product of the combination of the Party's theory and practice and the wisdom of the masses. It is a great innovation in water management in the plains area.

    Eight Hundred Years of Disaster Has Been Subdued

    From the winter of 1957, when large-scale water conservancy construction began, to the present, Northern Anhui has completed 4.3 billion cubic meters of earthwork for river networkization projects, accounting for 43% of the total task. Of the nine large rivers originally planned to be excavated, eight have started construction, and more than 10,000 first to sixth level rivers have been completed, and more than 120,000 ditches have been excavated, and a large number of culverts, bridges, and ponds and wells have been built. Among them, the rivers with a width of more than 40 meters and a depth of more than 6 meters have reached more than 2,000 kilometers in length, which is longer than China's Grand Canal.

    River networkization has exerted great power in agricultural production increase. Last year and this year, Northern Anhui expanded the area of rice cultivation in the face of severe drought. In 1957, only 1.07 million mu of rice were planted, which expanded to more than 4 million mu in 1958, and this year it expanded to 5 million mu. Wolong Lake in Suixi County used to be a barren lake and swamp area, with an annual grain yield of only 40 to 50 jin of wheat per mu; in the winter of 1957, the first river network in Northern Anhui was built, changing to planting 6,000 mu of rice, with an average yield of 700 jin per mu; after communization last year, the river network was further expanded, and more than 20,000 mu of rice were changed to be planted, and the average yield of the partially harvested rice reached 810 jin, which is more than ten times higher than the yield before river networkization.

    The role of river networkization in fighting disasters is even more significant. In terms of flood prevention, in July last year, five counties including Dangshan in northern Anhui experienced ten days of heavy rain, exceeding the maximum ten-day rainfall in the same period in 1957 by more than 200 millimeters. However, because the five counties had completed river network projects of about 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork per square kilometer, only 530,000 mu of cultivated land were temporarily flooded, and 20,000 mu were affected by disasters; while before the five counties carried out river networkization projects in 1957, 4.33 million mu of cultivated land were flooded, of which 2.43 million mu had no harvest. In terms of drought resistance, this year has also experienced a severe test. This summer and autumn, there was no rain for a hundred days. According to the past drought situation, without the river network, it would have been a barren land long ago. However, the water stored in the river network this year has ensured that 27 million mu of the more than 40 million mu of cultivated land in Northern Anhui will not suffer from drought. The water level of the river network has only dropped by about 5 centimeters, and the general river network storage is still 3 to 4 meters deep. As long as the irrigation tools are increased, the irrigation area can be greatly expanded. According to typical surveys, the Zilu Lake, where rice planting accounts for 70% of the total area, had an original river network water storage of 1.568 million cubic meters. After resisting drought for 31 days, the river network water storage was still 1.311 million cubic meters, which could continue to resist drought for 128 days. The masses praised the river networkization: "Spreading the river network across Northern Anhui, capturing the drought dragons and flood dragons; taking off the hat of disaster area, stomping our feet and shouting loudly to the south: We want to eat white rice, and we also want to have fish soup in the rice."

    The river network is the treasure house of the people of Northern Anhui, and it is the weapon to turn Northern Anhui into Jiangnan. The 12 million people of Northern Anhui want to fully realize the river networkization of nearly 40,000 square kilometers of land in Northern Anhui in the next two or three years, and thoroughly realize Chairman Mao's great call to "harness the Huai River well."

　　千里淮北撒河网
　　本报记者　于明
    淮北今昔
    千里平原，如花似锦。
    一道道新开的大河，伴随着平坦的公路，绿水盈盈，鹅鸭成群。许多地方，稻田相连，河网纵横。无数风车的轮盘，被风吹动，有如盛开的莲花凌空和脚下的水龙共舞。
    蚌埠淝淮公社的社员，出庄就能驾小船到田里劳动，用船在河网里运送肥料、农具和收割的庄稼。社员们站在船上高兴地唱道：“过去肩上挑，现在水上漂，一阵风儿来，两手叉着腰”。
    宿县三八公社紫芦湖大队，把过去的荒湖洼地，用河网改造得像新建的花园。每隔不到一里的河堤上，都栽了许多树，社员们把这些河边园地管理得整洁爱人。全队四千人，就在河网里养了十五万尾鱼，河堤上栽了二百万棵果木树。河堤上竖立的木牌上写着淮北人民的美好愿望：“这里将变得绿荫夹道，四季常青”，“这里将变得风景秀丽，果木丰盛。”
    有多少淮北人，对碧波鳞鳞的河网之水，发生了深厚的感情。过去紫芦湖年年受淹，流传着“女子不嫁紫芦湖，汉子不愿回故乡”的民谣。可是现在修了河网，外乡姑娘爱上了这个地方，也爱上了这个地方的年轻人。陈家科家一年内，就有两个儿子和外乡来修河的姑娘结了婚。七十三岁的陈金城在修河网后，才结束了他一生流浪在外的生活，回到家乡，过着永不再怕灾害的幸福晚年。在濉溪，我看到多少解放前流浪在江南的老年人，如狂似癫地夸河网，指说淮北一定变江南。
    这就是今年遭受百日奇旱的安徽淮北新景。
    水，现在变成了水利，淮北人民热爱它。可是，过去淮北人民一想到水，就想到了灾难：秋天一降大雨，铺天盖地的大水滚滚而来，遍野庄稼霎时被淹没，房屋被冲倒，衣物都在水上漂浮，人们爬到树上，呼号救命。地主、保长在茫茫大水中驾船掠夺，饥饿的农民落水被浪涛吞没。水退之后，到处是逃荒的人群，原野杂草丛生，死尸发臭，一片凄凉！
    这是解放前八百年来淮北人民的惨景。从1194年宋朝时黄河第四次改道开始，金人就利用河水泛滥损害人民。以后历经元、明、清朝，封建统治者为了维持南北漕运，搜刮民脂，继续迫使黄河逆水南下，造成淮北河道的淤塞垫高，流泄不畅。只是明洪武八年到二十五年的十八年之中，淮河流域因受黄河溃决为害就有八次之多。凤阳花鼓中“自从出了朱皇帝，十年倒有九年荒”，正是这种严重灾害的反映。国民党反动统治时期，只以导淮为名，搜刮民财，实际不但没有施行，反在1938年残无人道地在花园口炸毁黄河南堤，使淮北、河南和苏北八十九万人民遭受死亡，六百多万人流离失所。此后年年有灾，一直延续九年之久。八百年都为这种毁灭性灾害摧残的淮北人民，怎能不怕洪水有如猛兽？
    党的治水思想胜利了
    淮北人民一代一代传唱着：“爹也盼，娘也盼，只盼淮水不泛滥，有朝出个大救星，治好淮河万民安。”群众的希望终于在解放后实现了。
    1950年，伟大的号召便发出了，毛主席说：“一定要把淮河修好”。淮北人民和各地人民一起，全力投入了治淮运动。年年有几十万到几百万人，在大别山区和淮河上安营扎寨，展开了对大自然的斗争。
    大别山区的佛子岭、梅山等水库和淮河两岸的蓄洪工程，能把一百亿公方的水拦蓄起来，使淮河的排洪量提高了两倍多。到1957年，淮北平原初步建成了排涝系统。
    但是，治了洪水，把水送走，淮北内涝仍然十分严重。1952年内涝较轻，受灾面积还有一千万亩以上。究竟如何实现毛主席的号召，把淮河修好呢？中共安徽省委在1951年便开始进行深入的调查研究。
    我国自大禹凿龙门、疏九河的神话开始，疏导、排水的方法便占优势。明朝潘季驯和清朝靳辅治淮，用的也是这个方法。把洪水送走，成了我国治水的传统。解放后治淮开始，中央虽已提出：淮河中游蓄泄兼筹，而又以蓄为主的方针。可是在治淮中，有些人仍然因袭了旧的治水传统，他们认为送走洪水，堤防不破，就完成了治淮任务。省委研究了大量历史资料，证明旧的传统治水方法，不能达到根治淮河的目的。淮北两千年内，平均两年即有一次灾，其中旱涝各半。这就证明，只排水不蓄水，不能解除淮北的旱灾。每十年到三十年才有一次较大洪灾，而五年左右却有一次严重涝灾。这又证明，涝灾比洪灾严重，只重视防洪保堤，不重视治涝，是片面的。同时，淮北暴雨集中在7、8、9月，如能适应雨情特点，改种水稻，多种夏收作物，就可避灾保收。
    根据调查研究结果，省委在1953年便提出了“防洪保堤”、“治涝保收”和“改种避灾”的积极治淮办法。这就是：采取以除涝保收为重点，结合防洪保堤的治淮方针。除涝工程以蓄水为主，在广大平原上进行蓄水，既除涝又防旱，还能减轻洪水对淮堤的威胁。在耕作制度上则实行“三改”：扩大夏收作物面积，改种高产耐水作物如水稻等，改变广种薄收习惯。到1957年，淮北夏收作物面积由原来占耕地面积70％扩大到85％以上，水稻也发展到近百万亩，广种薄收习惯大大改变，对增产起了很大作用。但是，因为治淮中的两种思想（以蓄为主、还是以泄为主）的斗争没有彻底解决，在广大面积上蓄水治涝的方针就没有得到很好贯彻；同时因为淮北水源问题还没有得到很好解决，改种水稻的工作进行得比较缓慢。
    1957年是治淮工程大跃进的一年。这一年，经过整风，治淮的两种思想的斗争得到彻底解决。省委负责同志又亲自到淮北调查了群众挖深塘利用地下水的情况，证明了淮北有大量地下水可以解决水稻用水问题，可以防旱除涝。省委根据中央提出的“三主”治水方针，提出了“依靠群众，相信群众，小型为主，大中支持，以蓄为主，尽量少排，河网化，水稻化，把淮北变江南”的奋斗纲领。从此，党把淮北人民引向了更加理想的境地。
    根据淮北河网化的规划，就是要在淮北十八县新开九条大型河道，和原来的十五条河道交叉相通，组成河网干线；在大河网之间，每一平方公里的面积上，就有三、四公里的中小型河道，组成无数小网，和大河网相连接；河道下边普遍下井泉，把地下水、地上径流的水和外来水都蓄积起来。淮北河网尽量蓄水后，需要外流的水，将只有过去大水年份的流量的三十分之一，淮河干流负担大大减轻，即使有比1954年更大的雨量，也能免除洪水灾害。河网大量蓄水后，将使一半以上旱地改为水稻，而且保证七十天不雨不旱，其余旱地也能得到灌溉。实现河网化将使淮北成为水陆交通最发达的地方。乡乡通大船，村村通小船；陆路交通也四通八达。
    河网化后，淮北将是一个水产极丰盛的地方。据修河网最多、养鱼早的濉溪县计算，明年全县即可每人至少分到三百斤鱼，只此一项，每人每年即可收入一百元。此外还可大量养殖菱藕和其他水生动植物，大量发展鸡鹅猪鸭等家畜家禽。
    淮北将变成大地园林化最好的地区。河网成方格形，一公里一道河，堤上都栽了树，形成无数方格形的林带网。淮北整个地区将变得绿荫遮地，风沙不起，气候协调，寒暖适度，绿化了大地，保护了作物，木材用之不尽，果品取之不竭，淮北将变成名副其实的大花园。
    河网实行节节拦蓄，许多控制工程都将建立水电站。淮北利用廉价的水运运煤炭，还要建立许多火电站，使淮北逐渐走上机械化和电气化的道路。
    河网化使淮北人民由怕水变成爱水，它是党的治水方针的胜利。河网化是党的理论和实际相结合和群众智慧相结合的产物，它是平原地区治水的伟大创举。
    八百年灾害制服了
    从1957年冬大兴水利开始，到目前止，淮北已完成河网化工程四十三亿土方，占总任务的43％。原计划开挖的九条大型河道，已有八条动工，已完成的一至六级河道一万多条，并开挖了十二万多条沟，还修建了大量涵闸、桥梁和塘井等。其中四十米以上宽、六米以上深的河道即达二千多公里长，比我国的运河还要长。
    河网化在农业增产中发挥了巨大威力。去年和今年，淮北在旱情十分严重的情况下，扩大了水稻面积。1957年只种了一百零七万亩水稻，1958年即扩大到四百多万亩，今年又扩大到五百万亩。濉溪县卧龙湖，过去是荒湖洼地，每亩年产粮食只有四、五十斤小麦；1957年冬修成了淮北第一个河网，改种水稻六千亩，平均亩产七百斤；去年公社化后，河网进一步扩大，改种了二万多亩水稻，已收的部分水稻平均单产达八百一十斤，比河网化前提高产量十几倍。
    河网化对抗灾的作用更为显著。在防涝方面，淮北北部砀山等五县，去年7月连降十天大雨，超过1957年同期最大十天降雨量二百多毫米。但由于五个县已做了每平方公里约十万土方的河网工程，只有五十三万亩耕地临时过水，二万亩成灾；而1957年五县未作河网化工程以前，被淹耕地却达四百三十三万亩，其中颗粒无收的有二百四十三万亩。在抗旱方面，今年也经历了严重考验。今年夏秋百日无雨，根据过去旱灾情况，如无河网，早已赤地千里。但是今年河网蓄的水，却保证了淮北四千多万亩耕地中二千七百万亩不受旱，河网水位只降低五分米左右，一般河网蓄水仍有三、四米深。只要增加灌溉工具，灌溉面积还可大大扩大。根据典型调查，种水稻占总面积70％的紫芦湖，原河网存水为一百五十六点八万方，抗旱三十一天后，河网存水还有一百三十一点一万方，仍可继续抗旱一百二十八天。群众歌颂河网化道：“张开河网撒淮北，捉住旱龙和涝蛟；摘下头上灾区帽，跺脚向南高声叫：俺们要吃白米饭，饭里还要鱼汤浇。”
    河网是淮北人民的宝库，是把淮北变成江南的武器。淮北一千二百万人民要在今后两三年内，把淮北近四万平方公里的土地全部实现河网化，彻底实现毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召。（附图片）
