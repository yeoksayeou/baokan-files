Good News Sent to the Gathering of Heroes
By our correspondent in Shenyang

Shenyang, the famous machinery city of the country, is filled with jubilation. Hundreds of thousands of workers who are sticking to the production front day and night have just elected representatives to attend the National Congress of Heroes, and immediately threw themselves into the labor competition to present gifts to Beijing. In the past few days, the competition to enter Beijing, the competition to present gifts, and the performance competition have swept through the production workshops of the city's machinery factories; the 80,000 gift-giving experts who have emerged in the city have continuously sent good news about technological innovations and early completion of plans. People are determined to weave the production miracles they have created into a magnificent tapestry of good news and dedicate it to the grand meeting of heroes.

	New Gifts from Innovators
Technological innovation and presenting gifts to Beijing have become a resounding slogan for the city's machinery workers. Walking into the factory area, whether in large enterprises that produce heavy and precision products, or in small factories that manufacture machine parts, people will see workers gathered around machine tools improving technology. Many representatives who have been selected to participate in the National Congress of Heroes have shown their skills in the past few days, creating one miracle of technological innovation after another.

In the Shenyang Transformer Factory, Wang Feng'en, an innovation expert who has achieved an average of one technological innovation project every thirteen days for the past eight years, created three more technological innovation projects in one go before going to Beijing. This local expert, who became an engineer and university professor from a worker in the Great Leap Forward, adopted a three-way combination method and worked with branch secretary Zheng Ji and the workers to research and manufacture a pipe rolling machine. The machine was test-driven on the 18th, proving that it can use the remaining scraps and waste from the workshop to produce paper-insulated arc tubes that fully meet the quality requirements. These days, Wang Feng'en has just researched a clever device that can replace two large machine tools to cut arc cylinders; then, he once again mustered his energy to create a cutting device for insulating bushings for 110,000 to 220,000 volt switches. With this creation, the history of manual operation will be forever ended in the process of this product. By the eve of Wang Feng'en's departure to Beijing, he had already led the workers to increase the degree of mechanized operation in the insulation workshop from the original 30% to more than 82%. In order to share this experience with brother enterprises, Wang Feng'en came to the workshop on October 19, the factory's day off, to summarize his new experience in leading the workers to make a big fuss about technological revolution in the past year.

Kong Qingtang, a young grinder at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, was unspeakably excited to hear that he had been selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Heroes. This young innovator has implemented more than 20 technological innovation projects in the past two years. Last year, he completed four years' worth of work alone; this year, he completed five years' worth of work in six months. In order to improve technology, this young grinder did not know how many sleepless nights he had spent. The good news of attending the National Congress of Heroes encouraged him to strive for greater victories. The next day, he came to the workshop very early and skillfully applied the multi-table grinding experience he had created on the grinder he used. He saw small parts being simultaneously ground in several parts under the grinding wheel, and then jumping one after another into the box in front of the machine tool. On this day alone, he completed more than 100 hours of processing tasks, which is equivalent to half a month's work quota.

At the same moment, the flowers of technological innovation were also blooming in more machinery factories. In the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, 61 workers in the First Youth Group are carrying out a lively performance competition. Every worker quickly applies the new operation methods and new tools they have researched to production. These days, even the apprentice Yu Tingji's enthusiasm is very different from the past. He is determined to improve one or two technologies and offer a grand gift to the National Congress of Heroes. He stood attentively next to the machine tool, quickly unloading the processed parts from above, and then quickly installing another part on the machine tool in an instant. After his improvement, the auxiliary working hours for processing were reduced, and the production efficiency increased by 127%. People immediately gave this improvement a name, called the "circulating rapid operation method." In the Shenyang Transformer Factory, the workers in the Fourth Workshop have implemented 44 technological innovations in the past three days; the workers in the Second Workshop of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory have processed more than 5,000 parts in three days without a single defective product, and the production efficiency has increased by 170%.

	"Quality King" Creates New Achievements Again
In the car room of the Third Workshop of the Shenyang Fan Factory, someone passed on good news during the lunch break, saying that the "Quality King" in the workshop was going to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Heroes. Several quality inspectors who were fighting on the chessboard immediately stopped their hands. Guo Baoshen, the old inspector with a black beard, said: "The Quality King is not arrogant or complacent, and maintains excellent product quality like a perennial stream, with no defective products in five years. He really deserves this honor." Gao Zhenting, another old inspector who had just returned from inspecting the quality in the workshop, also praised it and said: "The quality of the Quality King is even more amazing before going to Beijing. I held a caliper and a steel ruler to measure the blower shaft he had just turned, and I couldn't find any problems at all. The tolerance is strictly as small as 8/1000ths of a millet grain, a little bigger is not okay, and a little smaller is even more impossible. He turned such precise things just to the standard. Looking at the smoothness, it is more neat and meticulous than the texture of a record, it is simply like a mirror."

The "Quality King" is the young turner Wang Chunxiang. Before going to Beijing, he was determined to create better results in terms of high output and high quality and dedicate it to the conference. On the day of the technical performance observation competition held in the workshop, thousands of turners from the factory came to watch his operation. On a silver-gray domestic large lathe, Wang Chunxiang performed the light knife he had recently improved and the grooving knife he had innovated with others. On this day, Wang Chunxiang cut the products quickly and well. In seven and a half hours, he completed 30 hours of work. The workers standing aside watching constantly stroked the processed parts with their hands and praised: It's really smooth and beautiful!

Before leaving, Wang Chunxiang was always worried about the processing quality of his apprentices, and even told his apprentices during lunch: "Be sure to calculate the amount of feed before processing. When impact processing, the feed should be slowed down first." The little apprentice said smartly: "Should I turn it according to the dimensions written on the blackboard?" Wang Chunxiang smiled. It turned out that Wang Chunxiang had prepared a small blackboard next to the machine tool and calculated the dimensions of the processed parts for his apprentices and wrote them on it so that the apprentices could pay attention to improving product quality at any time. Wang Chunxiang himself had once been a "Defective Product King" when he was an apprentice. Later, under the education of the Party, he established a new style of high output and high quality. At a workshop exhibition, he began to be praised as the "Quality King". Since the beginning of this year, he has completed 21 months of work, and the quality of each processed part is excellent.

	Moving Towards the Advanced Ranks Together
In the "Present Gifts to Beijing" competition, countless advanced producers are enthusiastically helping their companions to move towards the advanced ranks. In the past few days, "service teams," "collaboration teams," and "treasure delivery teams" composed of thousands of advanced producers have sprung up in every corner of the city like mushrooms after a rain. The Shenyang Transformer Factory's metalworking workshop, which was the first to blow this horn, has completed the 1959 production plan 100 days ahead of schedule due to the effective activities carried out, and presented a grand gift to the National Congress of Heroes. In this achievement that shines with peculiar brilliance, how many advanced producers are selflessly working without regard to reward!

    喜报送到群英会
    本报驻沈阳记者
    沈阳，这座誉满全国的机械名城，到处是一片欢腾的景象。日夜坚守在生产战线的几十万职工，刚刚选出赴京参加群英会的代表，又立刻投入到进京献礼的劳动竞赛。几天来，进京赛、献礼赛和表演竞赛，席卷全城机械工厂的生产车间；全市涌现出来的八万名献礼能手，不断传来革新技术和提前完成计划的捷报。人们决心用自己创造的生产奇迹，绣织成一幅如花似锦的喜报，献给群英盛会。
          革新者的新礼物
    革新技术，进京献礼，成了全市机械工人一个响亮的行动口号。走进工厂区，不论在生产重型、精密产品的大型企业，还是那些制造机器配件的小型工厂，人们都会看到聚集在机床旁改进技术的职工。许多被选为参加群英会的代表，这几天来更是大显身手，一个接连一个地创造出革新技术的奇迹。
    在沈阳变压器厂，一个八年来平均每十三天实现一项技术革新项目的革新能手王凤恩，在进京赴会前，又一鼓作气创造出三项革新技术的项目。这位在大跃进中由工人成为工程师和大学教授的土专家，采取三结合的办法，同支部书记郑吉和工人们一道，研究制造出一部卷管机。18日开车试验，证明这台设备可以利用车间里剩下来的边料废料，生产出质量完全合乎规格要求的胶纸电弧管。这几天，王凤恩刚研究出一种可以代替两台大机床切割电弧筒的巧妙装置；接着，他又再次鼓足干劲，创造一种十一万到二十二万伏开关套管绝缘的切割装置。有了这项创造，在这种产品的工序上，将永远结束了手工操作的历史。到王凤恩进京前夕为止，他已经领导工人们把绝缘车间的机械化操作程度，由原来的30％，提高到82％以上，为了把这项经验交流给兄弟企业，王凤恩在10月19日工厂休假，这天特地来到车间，总结了他一年来领导工人大闹技术革命的新经验。
    沈阳第三机床厂青年磨工孔庆堂，听说自己被选为出席群英会的代表，心里真有说不出的激动。这个青年革新家，两年来一共实现过二十多个技术革新的项目。去年，他一个人完成四年的工作量；今年，又以六个月的时间，完成了五年工作任务。为了改进技术，这个青年磨工不知度过了多少不眠之夜。进京出席群英会的喜讯，鼓舞着他争取更大的胜利。第二天，他很早就来到车间，在他使用的磨床上，熟练地运用着自己创造的多台磨削经验。只见一个个小小的零件，在磨轮下同时经受着好几部分的磨削，然后又一个接一个地跳到机床前面的箱子里。只是这一天，他完成一百多小时的加工任务，相当于半个月的工作定额。
    在同一个时刻，技术革新的花朵，也在更多的机械厂盛开着。在沈阳风动工具厂，第一青年小组六十一名工人，正在开展热火朝天的表演赛。每个工人，都把自己研究出的新的操作方法，新的刀具，迅速地应用到生产中。这两天，就连徒工于廷吉的干劲，也与往日大不相同，他决心改进一两项技术，向群英会献上一份厚礼。他聚精会神地站在机床旁边，一会儿把加工件很快地从上面卸下来，一瞬间又把另一个活装在机床上。经过他的改进，加工的辅助工时减少，提高生产效率127％。人们立刻给这项改进起了个名字，叫做“循环快速操作法”。在沈阳变压器厂，第四车间的职工，在最近三天中就实现了四十四项技术革新；沈阳水泵厂第二车间的职工，三天中加工的五千多个部件，没有一个废品，生产效率提高了170％。
      “质量大王”再创新成绩
    在沈阳扇风机厂三车间的车房里，午休时有人传来一个好消息说，车间里的“质量大王”就要进京参加群英会了。正在棋盘上交锋的几位质量检查员，立刻停下了手，那个留黑胡子的老检查员郭宝申说：“质量大王不骄傲不自满，像长年流水一样保持着优等的产品质量，五年不出废品，真该得到这份荣誉”。另一个刚从车间检查质量回来的老检查员高振廷，也满口叫好地说：“质量大王”进京前，质量更加呱呱叫了，我拿着卡尺、钢尺在他刚车出来的鼓风机轴上横量、竖量，半点毛病也找不出来。公差严格到只有小米粒的千分之八那样细微，大一点不行，小一点更不行，那般精密的东西，他车得正合标准。再看光洁度，比唱片的纹路还整齐、细致，简直像面镜子。
    “质量大王”，就是青年车工王春香。他在进京赴会以前，决心在高产优质方面创造出更好的成绩，献给大会。在车间举行的技术表演观摩赛的那天，全厂上千个车工都来观看他的操作。在一台银灰色的国产大车床上，王春香表演了他新近改进的光刀和跟别人一起革新的槽刀。这一天，王春香切削的产品又快又好，七个半钟头，干完了三十个钟头的活。站在一旁参观的工人，不时用手抚摸加工的部件，连声称赞道：真光溜、真漂亮！
    王春香临走前，对徒工的加工质量总是放心不下，连吃午饭时也嘱咐徒弟说：“千万在加工前要算好了走刀量，冲击加工时，走刀先要放慢些。”小徒弟伶俐地说：“是照着黑板上写的尺寸去车吗？”王春香笑了。原来王春香在机床旁边，预备了一块小黑板，把加工件的尺寸都给徒工算好，写在上面，好让徒工们随时注意提高产品质量。王春香本人当徒工时，曾一度当过“废品大王”，后来在党的教育下，树立起高产优质的新风格，在一次车间展览会上，他开始被人们誉为“质量大王”。今年以来，他已经完成了二十一个月的工作量，加工的部件个个都是优等的质量。
          共同迈向先进行列
    在“进京献礼”的竞赛中，无数的先进生产者，正在满腔热情地帮助自己的同伴走向先进行列。这几天，由数千名先进生产者组成的“服务队”、“协作队”和“送宝队”，像雨后春笋般地出现在全市的各个角落。第一个吹起这个号角的沈阳变压器厂金工车间，由于开展了这一富有成效的活动，已经提前一百天完成了1959年的生产计划，向群英会献了一份厚礼。在这个闪发着奇光异彩的成绩里，包藏着多少个先进生产者不计报酬的崇高的劳动呵！
