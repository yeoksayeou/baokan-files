Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 22nd: The more than 100,000 workers of Anshan Iron and Steel are working with soaring enthusiasm to increase production and set records to welcome the convening of the National "Heroes' Congress." In mid-October, the company's pig iron and steel production both created the highest ten-day output record in the history of Anshan Iron and Steel. In these ten days, pig iron exceeded the plan by 1,917 tons, steel exceeded the plan by 6,840 tons, and steel products exceeded the plan by 14,014 tons.

To welcome the convening of the National "Heroes' Congress," the first joint technical performance competition week began on the 15th in various units throughout the company. In recent days, production records have been constantly refreshed. Compared with the average daily output from October 1st to 14th, the average daily output in the first five days of the performance competition week increased by 15.6% for steel, 10.7% for pig iron, and 16.3% for steel products. During the performance competition week, the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee also held a meeting of Party Committee secretaries, factory directors, and mine managers to promptly summarize and promote experience, guiding leading cadres of various factories and mines to continue to go deep into the front line, participate in performances, and lead performances. Zeng Yangqing, the director of the No. 1 Steel Plant, led the workers of the No. 4 open hearth furnace in a performance of molten iron charging, expanding the furnace's charging capacity from 240 tons to 280 tons. Under the leadership of the Party Committee secretary, factory director, and engineers, the No. 3 Steel Plant experienced a sharp increase in production. In the first five days of the performance competition week, the average daily steel output increased by 1,144 tons compared to the average from the 1st to the 14th. Under the leadership of leading cadres such as the Party Committee secretary, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant improved the hot blast temperature, increased the batch size, and improved slag and iron tapping operations, increasing the average daily iron output by 11.4%. On the 19th, all the workers of this ironmaking plant held a mobilization meeting, determined to produce an additional 30,000 tons of high-quality pig iron for the country in October.

Now, the workers of various factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel are actively summing up experience, carrying out large-scale appraisals, comparisons, and establishing models, preparing to launch the second joint technical performance competition week, determined to present the National "Heroes' Congress" with new production achievements in October.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd: The first "King of Open Hearth Furnaces" of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company—No. 2 giant open hearth furnace—unveiled its production prelude. The furnace baking began at 7:20 this morning. In a few days, it will join forces with the newly tapped No. 1 open hearth furnace to participate in the nation's battle for steel. The main body construction of the No. 2 open hearth furnace, from the start of construction on September 22nd to the completion of furnace baking, took only one month in total. The builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel, always known for their fast and high-quality construction, have once again created a miracle in the history of large open hearth furnace construction.

The steel output per heat of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 open hearth furnace is twice that of the No. 1 open hearth furnace, while its construction period is greatly shortened compared to the No. 1 open hearth furnace. The installation period of the furnace body's 915 tons of metal structure took only sixteen days, twenty-nine days less than the No. 1 open hearth furnace, while the weight of the components was ninety-five tons heavier than the No. 1 open hearth furnace. The bricklaying volume of the main body of the open hearth furnace reached more than one million bricks, and the furnace building workers completed it in only fourteen and a half days, seven and a half days less than the No. 1 open hearth furnace.

Encouraged by the Party's General Line, three thousand construction heroes launched head-to-head competitions, breaking quotas one after another, and new records continued to appear. When installing the cast steel wall panels of the No. 1 open hearth furnace body, the Zhang Wenying group of crane operators could only install seven or eight panels per shift at the fastest speed. In the installation of the No. 2 open hearth furnace, they created a new record of installing nineteen panels per shift. During the construction of the No. 1 open hearth furnace, apprentice bricklayers Yi Shubin and Wang Hongshan could only do some auxiliary work such as transporting materials; now, they have mastered techniques such as bricklaying and line pulling, laying 1,360 bricks in eight hours, each exceeding the quota by more than one hundred bricks.

When the No. 1 open hearth furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel's steelmaking system began tapping steel, more than twenty auxiliary projects, such as the magnetic materials room and bulk materials room, as well as transportation, power, and water supply and drainage facilities, were put into production at the same time, thus creating favorable conditions for the accelerated construction of the "King of Open Hearth Furnaces."

    鞍钢钢铁旬产量创最高纪录
    武钢二号巨型平炉烘炉大喜
    据新华社鞍山22日电  鞍钢十多万职工正在以冲天的干劲闹高产、创纪录，迎接全国“群英会”的召开。10月中旬，全公司的生铁和钢的产量都创造了鞍钢有史以来的旬产最高纪录。这十天，生铁比计划超产一千九百一十七吨，钢超产六千八百四十吨，钢材超产一万四千零一十四吨。
    为了迎接全国“群英会”的召开，从15日起，在全公司各单位展开了第一个联合技术表演竞赛周。连日来，生产纪录不断刷新。表演竞赛周开始五天来的平均日产量同10月1日到14日的平均日产量相比，钢增长15.6％，生铁增长10.7％，钢材增长16.3％。在表演竞赛周中，鞍钢党委还举行了党委书记、厂矿长会议，及时总结和推广经验，引导各厂矿的领导干部继续深入第一线，参加表演、领导表演。第一炼钢厂的厂长曾扬清领导四号平炉的职工进行了兑铁水的表演，使这座平炉的装入量由二百四十吨扩大到二百八十吨。第三炼钢厂在党委书记、厂长、工程师等带头表演下，生产猛烈上升，表演竞赛周开始五天来钢的平均日产量，又比1日到14日平均增产一千一百四十四吨。炼铁厂的职工在党委书记等领导干部带头表演中，提高风温、增加料批、改进出渣出铁的操作，使铁的平均日产量提高11.4％。在19日，这个炼铁厂的全体职工举行了誓师大会，决心在10月份内为国家多生产三万吨优质生铁。
    现在鞍钢各厂矿职工正在积极总结经验，大评、大比、大树标兵，准备开展第二个联合技术表演竞赛周，决心以10月满堂红的生产新成就，向全国“群英会”献礼。
    据新华社武汉22日电　武汉钢铁公司第一座“平炉之王”——二号巨型平炉揭开生产序幕，今晨七点二十分钟开始烘炉了，数天后，就要同新近出钢的一号平炉并肩作战，参加祖国为钢而战的行列。二号平炉的本体工程，从9月22日动工建设到建成烘炉，总共只用了一个月。一向以快速优质施工著称的武钢建设者们，又创造了大型平炉建设史上的奇迹。
    武钢二号平炉每炉出钢量比一号平炉大一倍，而它的建设工期却比一号平炉大大缩短。炉体九百一十五吨的金属结构安装工期，只用十六天，比一号平炉缩短二十九天，构件的重量却比一号平炉重九十五吨。平炉主体工程的砌砖量达到一百多万块，而筑炉工人只用十四天半的时间就完成了，比一号平炉缩短七天半。
    三千名建设英雄在党的总路线鼓舞下，展开了对手赛，纷纷突破定额，新纪录不断出现。吊装工张文英小组在安装一号平炉炉体的铸钢墙板时，最快速度每班只安装七、八块，在二号平炉的安装中，创造了每班安装十九块的新纪录。筑炉徒工易淑斌、王洪善在建设一号平炉时，只能干些运料等辅助工作；现在，已掌握了砌砖、拉线等技术，八个小时砌一千三百六十块砖，每人突破定额一百多块。
    武钢炼钢系统在一号平炉出钢的时候，磁性材料间、散状材料间等二十多项辅助工程，以及交通、动力、供排水设施，都同时投入生产，因此为“平炉之王”的加速建设创造了有利条件。
