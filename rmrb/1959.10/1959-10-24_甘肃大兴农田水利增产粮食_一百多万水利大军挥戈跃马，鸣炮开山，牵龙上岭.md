Lanzhou, October 23rd (By our own correspondent) - As the "Three Autumns" campaign basically comes to an end, the people of Gansu, without pausing for breath or removing their armor, are swiftly throwing themselves into the 1960 battle to construct irrigation works and conserve water and soil.

Now, on the 460,000 square kilometers of land in Gansu Province, it is a scene of bustling activity everywhere. Countless trucks and rubber-wheeled carts, fully loaded with steel bars, cement, pebbles, and other building materials, speed day and night along the crisscrossing highways and byways, heading towards new irrigation construction sites that are springing up like mushrooms after rain. Every day, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of newly formed irrigation corps, brandishing weapons and riding horses, are setting up camps in desolate mountains and remote wilds, on steep cliffs, firing cannons to open mountains, and leading dragons over ridges. The entire province only sounded the battle drum for large-scale irrigation construction at the end of September, and by October 15th, the labor army投入 into the irrigation front had reached 1.23 million. On the 16th alone, it rapidly surged by more than 400,000 people. Now, from the Hexi Corridor, where melting ice and snow irrigate fertile fields, to the Dongzhi Plateau, a key area for soil erosion control, from the arid Wanyang gully area in the central region to the lush Gannan grasslands, more than 60 large and medium-sized reservoirs with a storage capacity of over one million cubic meters, more than 60 square-shaped canals irrigating over ten thousand mu, and tens of millions of small-scale irrigation projects are being carried out simultaneously. It is truly a scene of flowers blooming everywhere, displaying a riot of color. According to preliminary statistics, the province has repaired 640,000 mu of irrigated land and newly built 24,000 mu of irrigated land in the past half month, and has controlled soil erosion over an area of more than 1,700 square kilometers. Tianshui County, taking the lead and starting early, has by the 16th newly built and expanded 14 irrigation canal projects, capable of irrigating more than 10,000 mu of land; and repaired and improved more than 100 actually irrigated canal projects, capable of irrigating more than 157,000 mu of land. Dingxi Prefecture has already completed 1.5 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. Truly, with many people and great momentum, the progress is unstoppable.

The characteristics of the current irrigation and water and soil conservation movement in Gansu Province are: advanced targets, magnificent scale, strong leadership, sound organization, full preparation, specific measures, and an unprecedentedly high level of ambition among the masses. The situation on the irrigation front is very good. First of all, under the situation of sweeping away right-leaning thoughts and greatly boosting revolutionary zeal, the Provincial Party Committee put forward an inspiring and ambitious plan. In Gansu, a place where droughts occur in nine out of ten years, where water is grain and water is life, it is crucial to seize the central link of irrigation to drive the comprehensive leap forward of other rural work. This is the experience summarized by the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party from ten years of struggle and ten years of great change. The scale of the irrigation plan for the entire province in 1960 represents a huge leap forward: in 1959, the province increased its irrigated area by 3.5 million mu, and in 1960, the actual irrigated area will increase by 7 million mu; in 1959, the actual completed water storage projects amounted to over 200 million cubic meters, and in 1960, the newly built and continued water storage projects will reach over 700 million cubic meters; in 1959, 420 million cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed, and in 1960, it is necessary to complete more than 880 million cubic meters. Many of the targets for next year, compared with 1959, have doubled. In addition, in order to ensure the high-speed development of animal husbandry to meet the ever-growing need for non-staple food among urban and rural people, it is also planned to increase the irrigated area of ​​pastures in pastoral areas by 350,000 mu in 1960. The power generation of small rural hydroelectric stations, the various drainage and irrigation machinery, and the various water-lifting tools will all have substantial increases in 1960 compared with 1959. Obviously, this is a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan. This plan reflects the urgent desire of the more than 13 million people of Gansu Province who have suffered from drought disasters. Secondly, Party committees at all levels insisted on putting politics in command from the beginning and strengthening Party leadership. At the 11th Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held at the end of September, the Provincial Committee issued an order to the people of the province: after the autumn harvest is basically completed, immediately launch a large-scale irrigation construction movement, mobilize 30% to 40% of the province's rural labor force, that is, 1.5 million to 2 million laborers, to complete irrigation projects that can generate benefits next year in a concentrated effort, and increase the actual irrigated area by 5 million mu to 7 million mu. Following this, the Gansu Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial-wide mobilization meeting for irrigation and water and soil conservation, requiring a 100-day battle to complete more than 80% of the 1960 irrigation tasks and to strive for the early realization of the province's reservoir-pond-canal network and high standards of water and soil conservation. After this, special districts, counties, and people's communes established irrigation and water and soil conservation movement headquarters, with Party committee secretaries at all levels personally taking charge and taking the lead. In terms of leadership methods, Party committees at all levels insisted on following the mass line and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. The irrigation construction sites throughout the province launched a vigorous "three-beyond and four-comparison" campaign of exceeding tasks, exceeding quotas, exceeding advanced levels, and comparing enthusiasm, comparing measures, comparing progress, and comparing effectiveness. The competitive upsurge swept to every corner. In terms of operational methods, from the beginning, they adopted the approach of concentrating manpower, organizing large corps, conducting periodic assaults, and carrying out large-scale management. Under the conditions of remuneration according to labor and equivalent exchange, they organized large-scale cooperation between special districts, between counties, and between communes. Huajialing, which won the high-standard red flag for water and soil conservation last year through the large-scale cooperation of Tongwei, Huining, Dingxi, and Jingning counties, will continue to cooperate this winter and next spring to further improve standards and expand the results. In order to improve work efficiency, accelerate project progress, and save labor, various localities are vigorously engaging in tool reform. Various semi-mechanized and locally-made mechanized tools are emerging one after another on various irrigation construction sites. The masses believe that with large-scale cooperation and technological revolution, our irrigation construction undertaking will be like a tiger that has grown wings! (Liu Bang)

    甘肃大兴农田水利增产粮食
    一百多万水利大军挥戈跃马，鸣炮开山，牵龙上岭
    本报兰州23日电　甘肃人民在“三秋”战役基本结束的时候，马不停蹄，人不解甲，迅速投入了1960年度兴修水利和水土保持的战斗。
    现在甘肃省的四十六万平方公里的土地上，到处一片人喊马啸。无数的汽车和胶轮车满载着钢筋、水泥、卵石和其他的建筑器材，日日夜夜，飞奔在纵横交错的公路和便道上，驶向犹如雨后春笋的新水利工地。每天都有几万、十几万和几十万新组成的水利兵团，挥戈跃马，开到荒山僻野和悬崖陡壁间，安营扎寨，鸣炮开山，牵龙上岭。全省9月底才擂响大办水利的战鼓，到10月15日，投入水利战线的劳动大军已达一百二十三万。仅16日这一天，就迅速激增了四十多万人。现在，从溶冰化雪灌良田的河西走廊到水土流失重点区的董志塬，从中部干旱万阳沟壑区到水草丰美的甘南草原，已有蓄水一百万立方米以上的大中型水库六十多座、灌溉万亩以上的方型水渠六十多条和数以千万计的小型水利工程同时开展。真是花开遍地，万紫千红。根据初步统计，全省半个月来已经整修了水地六十四万亩和新修了水地二万四千亩，已控制水土流失一千七百多平方公里。一马当先、动手较早的天水雪区，到16日已经新修成扩灌溉道工程十四条，可灌地一万多亩；整修和改善实灌渠道工程一百多条，可灌地十五万七千多亩。定西专区已经完成土石方工程一百五十万立方米。真是人多势众，势如破竹。
    甘肃省当前的水利和水土保持运动的特点是：指标先进，规模宏伟，领导有力，组织健全，准备充分，措施具体和群众的雄心壮志空前高涨。水利战线的形势好得很。首先是省委在横扫右倾思想、大鼓革命干劲的形势下，提出一个振奋人心的宏伟计划。在甘肃这个十年九旱、水就是粮食，水就是生命的地方，抓住水利这个中心环节，带动农村其他各项工作的全面跃进。这是中共甘肃省委从十年战斗、十年巨变中总结出来的经验。1960年度全省水利计划跃进幅度是巨大的：1959年全省增加灌溉面积三百五十万亩，1960年增加实灌是七百万亩；1959年实际完成蓄水工程二亿多立方米，1960年新修和续修蓄水工程达到七亿多立方米；1959年完成土石方工程四亿二千万立方米，1960年需要完成八亿八千多万立方米。明年的许多指标和1959年度比较起来，都是成倍翻番。此外，为了保证畜牧业的高度发展，以适应城乡人民日益增长的对于副食品的需要，1960年度还计划增加牧区草原灌溉面积三十五万亩。农村小型水电站的发电量、各种排灌机械和各种提水工具，1960年度较1959年度均要有长足的增加。显然，这是一个更大、更好、更全面的跃进计划。这个计划反映了饱受干旱灾害的甘肃省一千三百多万人民的迫切愿望。其次，各级党委一开始就坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导。在9月底举行的中共甘肃省委第十一次全体会议（扩大）上，省委向全省人民发出了：在秋收基本结束后，立即展开一个大办水利运动，动员占全省农村劳动力30％到40％，即一百五十万到二百万个劳动力，突击完成明年能够发挥效益的水利工程，增加实灌面积五百万亩到七百万亩的战斗号令，接着，甘肃省人民委员会又召开了全省水利和水土保持誓师动员大会，要求大战一百天，完成1960年度水利任务的80％以上，为早日实现全省的库塘渠网化和水土保持高标准化而奋斗。在这之后，各专区，各县和各人民公社纷纷成立水利和水土保持运动指挥部，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，亲自上阵。在领导方法上，各级党委坚持大走群众路线和大搞群众运动。全省的水利工地展开了轰轰烈烈的超任务、超定额、超先进和比干劲、比措施、比进度、比实效的“三超四比”运动，竞赛热潮漫卷到各个角落。在作战方法上一开始就采取集中人力、组织大兵团、定期突击、大面积治理。在按劳计酬、等价交换的条件下，组织专区与专区、县与县、公社与公社之间的大协作。去年由通渭、会宁、定西和静宁四个县大协作而获得水土保持高标准红旗的华家岭，今冬明春仍然由这几个县继续协作，继续提高标准和扩大战果。为了提高工效、加速工程进度和节省劳动力，各地正在大闹工具改革。各种半机械化和土机械化工具在各个水利工地上纷纷应运而生。群众对当前形势的看法是：有了大协作和技术革命，我们的水利建设事业就如猛虎添翼！　（柳梆）
