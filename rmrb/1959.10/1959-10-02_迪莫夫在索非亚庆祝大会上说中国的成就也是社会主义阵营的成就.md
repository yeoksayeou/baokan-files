Staikov, member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Committee of the Fatherland Front; Dimov, alternate member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee; Prahov, alternate member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions; Kubadinski, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee; and Kozovski, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Assembly, attended the celebration meeting.

Dimov, alternate member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, said in his speech that in the past ten years, the Chinese people have made brilliant achievements in agriculture. The achievements made by farmers after joining agricultural cooperatives and people's communes are even more significant. The people's communes have opened up broad possibilities for improving agricultural labor productivity, implementing mechanization, and adopting modern technology.

Dimov said that the Bulgarian people are happy for the comprehensive achievements made by the Chinese people. We believe that these achievements are also our achievements, the achievements of the entire socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union. In his speech, Dimov also talked about the fact that China's international status is increasing day by day, and praised the Chinese Communist Party's contribution in the struggle against modern revisionism.

Ambassador Zhu Qiwu then spoke.
