Advancing Tenaciously Towards the "Cutting Edge"
    —A Record of the Advanced Deeds of Xu Yongji, a Young Technician from Shaanxi Province
    Immense Difficulties Cannot Stop a Communist Party Member
    In September 1956, Xu Yongji, with a burning heart for building the motherland, left university and embarked on a design work post at the Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. Soon after arriving at the design institute, the Party committee assigned the chief engineer to explain "thin-shell" technology to comrades like Xu Yongji; subsequently, the Party entrusted her with the task of researching "thin-shell structure design." "Thin-shell structure design" is a cutting-edge technology in architectural science, a very thin, curved, large-scale building component, generally used as a roof, which can save a great deal of steel and cement. Xu Yongji knew that mastering this technology would be difficult, requiring advanced knowledge of mathematics and mechanics. In the past, very few people in our country mastered this technology, and even now, research and application are just beginning. But when she thought about how the use of this technology could save the country a lot of building materials, improve building technology, and enrich architectural art, she bravely accepted the task and resolved to conquer this cutting-edge technological fortress.
    There is no smooth road to breaking through this fortress; for Xu Yongji, a young person fresh out of school, there were many "obstacles." Sometimes, to understand a technical document, it was necessary to apply dozens of formulas, each of which required dozens of steps of calculation. To solve a difficulty, it was often necessary to search everywhere and consult many foreign-language reference books, in Russian, English, French, German, and even Czech and Polish. Her foreign language foundation was also very poor, making reading quite difficult. Some people gossiped, saying, "A greenhorn just out of school, engaging in such important technical research work, what can she accomplish?" At that time, she also had some feelings of fear and difficulty, but then she thought: "I am a Communist Party member, should I shrink back in the face of difficulties? No! What are difficulties? Immense difficulties cannot shake the firm will of a Communist Party member." With this thought, strength came. As long as there were books, articles, or materials about "thin-shell" research, she studied them carefully. If she didn't understand it the first time, she read it two or three times until she understood it. When studying the design of "cylindrical thin shells," she studied seven technical materials, including Soviet architectural mechanics calculation methods and German mathematical analysis methods, and calculated more than seven hundred formulas. For foreign languages she didn't understand, she brought out the dictionary to look them up. She also often used her spare time in the evenings to study advanced mathematics at a school more than twenty li away. Last year, when she went to the construction site for labor training, she did not interrupt her studies; she often worked all day and then used the evenings to study. She not only studied on her own, but also humbly sought advice from the comrades around her. In this way, after more than two years, she learned and mastered the design theory of nine types of thin shells, such as "cylindrical thin shells," "hyperbolic paraboloid thin shells," and "folded plate thin shells," taking a big step forward in the road to conquering cutting-edge technology.

      Dare to Do What Others Have Not Done
    After mastering the basic theory of "thin shell" design, Xu Yongji did not stop moving forward. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, she dared to think and act, boldly innovated, humbly learned from advanced experience, and creatively carried out design. Last December, the institute undertook the design task of a cable factory. During the design process, the Party called for vigorously promoting "combining indigenous and foreign methods," saving steel and cement, and building factory buildings with bricks. Although this design was not the task of Xu Yongji's group, she realized that saving building materials for the country was the responsibility of every design worker. She actively responded to the Party's call and, using her spare time, worked with her group to study how to use the structure of "thin shells" to design this factory building. Xu Yongji had seen in a magazine the "non-tension brick thin shell" experimented with in Hungary, which made her realize that bricks could be used instead of steel and cement to make "thin shells." But it was not clear how to use brick shells to form a roof system. She also saw the Soviet Union's "slab-type composite roof" in another magazine, and together with her group, she studied and absorbed the Soviet "composite roof" form and the Hungarian "brick thin shell" structure, creatively designing the "non-tension brick thin shell composite roof." However, there was no ready-made formula for calculating the curved surface of this thin shell. After repeated trial calculations, she discussed with the group members and consulted engineers, and finally successfully calculated it. This component is technologically advanced and can save 20% to 40% of steel.
    In August of this year, the Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute received a large oil pool design task. This type of design had never been done before, and the technology was relatively complicated. At that time, some comrades were afraid to accept it. When Xu Yongji heard that such large oil pools had been made of steel plates for the pool walls in the past, both domestically and abroad, she thought that if other materials could be used instead, a large amount of steel could be saved for the country. Therefore, she and the members of her group studied and actively requested the leadership to assign this task to them, and boldly proposed a design plan to use "reinforced concrete thin shells" instead of steel plates as the pool walls. After the plan was proposed, some comrades said, "It is not safe to use reinforced concrete for such a large oil pool. Who will be responsible if there is an accident?" Some individuals even deliberately made things difficult for her. At this time, the Party committee criticized these incorrect ideas and firmly supported Xu Yongji's design plan. The Party committee secretary said, "We must dare to boldly innovate, dare to do what others have not done." These words gave her great encouragement and increased her courage to create boldly. After repeated research, she finally successfully completed the design of this project, which can save 50% of steel compared to steel plate structures.
    Xu Yongji is not satisfied with her achievements, and creative designs continue to emerge. She and her group comrades excellently completed the design of the Lintong swimming pool, with a span of thirty-eight meters and a length of sixty-two meters, using a thin-shell structure, which can save one hundred tons of steel compared to a steel structure. At the National Prestressed and Reinforced Concrete Conference this year, it was considered that this design is a new technology with development prospects. In the engineering design of an exhibition hall, she successfully designed a thirty-meter "curved prestressed reinforced thin shell," solving the problem of large-span sag and cracks.

      Developing "Thin Shell" Calculation Methods
    The calculation of building structures is an important basis for architectural design. To make an engineering design economical, practical, and safe, accurate calculations are required. The calculation of "thin shell structure design" is even more complicated, and there are many calculations for which there are no ready-made calculation methods. In order to simplify the calculation of "thin shell structures" and solve some difficult problems that cannot be calculated, Xu Yongji created three new calculation methods in the process of creative design.
    In March of this year, Xu Yongji participated in the engineering design of an exhibition hall. At that time, the task was urgent, and drawings were required to be produced on schedule. The education hall design of this project adopted a "hyperbolic rotating thin shell." If the old calculation method was used, it would take ten days just to design the roof of this hall. How to simplify the calculation method became a key issue in accelerating the design progress. But changing the calculation methods that have been used for a long time is not an easy task. Moreover, she was suffering from chronic pneumonia, and her head would be dizzy if she read too much. But when she thought that thousands of workers on the construction site could not start construction without drawings, she forgot the doctor's advice to rest for a month and fought alongside everyone for five days, finally finding a way to calculate the hyperbolic rotating thin shell, which doubled the work efficiency and was accurate and reliable. In this way, she and her comrades worked together and made concerted efforts to complete the exhibition hall engineering design ten days ahead of schedule.
    As early as August of last year, the technical research group of the Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute successfully trial-produced a "wavy thin-shell" roof. This structure saves more steel and reduces construction procedures compared to "cylindrical thin shells." However, the calculation is quite complicated, and there is no ready-made calculation method. After the design was successful, a comrade used the common calculation method to calculate it many times, but failed to calculate it. Therefore, this problem has been a "mystery" for a year. How to solve this "mystery" so that the successfully trial-produced advanced structure can be quickly applied to design has been lingering in Xu Yongji's mind. She was inspired in participating in the engineering design of the exhibition hall, and felt that a certain method could be used to calculate the "wavy thin shell." She used this method to repeatedly try to calculate, but failed in three calculations. How much effort does it take to calculate once! The longest time she spent more than a month, and the shortest time was also more than a week. If a number or symbol is wrong, all previous efforts will be wasted. When encountering a difficulty, she has to turn over the materials and look up the dictionary, but she firmly believes that failure is the mother of success, and as long as there is determination, success can be achieved. Sure enough, she succeeded in the fourth calculation.
    Xu Yongji deeply realized how difficult it is to create a new design and a new calculation method! Therefore, once she succeeds in creating it, she always wants to promote it quickly so that everyone can master it. When comrades from fraternal units came to the Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute to learn "thin shell" technology, she took the time to sort out her notes for them to read, explained the parts they didn't understand in detail, and helped them quickly master this new technology. She also wrote six scientific research papers on her own creations (four of which were co-written with other comrades), two of which are scientific research projects of the Shaanxi Provincial Academy of Sciences in 1959.

    Advancing Along the Road of Being Both Red and Expert
    Xu Yongji is able to constantly muster her energy, study diligently, and make outstanding achievements because, under the education and cultivation of the Party, she can conscientiously study politics, transform her thinking, and continuously consolidate her world outlook of building socialism and serving the working class. After entering the university, under the education and help of the Party, she gradually clarified that the purpose of studying is to build socialism, not for personal fame and gain. Therefore, her performance in all aspects was very prominent, and she was repeatedly rated as an "all-round good" outstanding student. When she was a sophomore in college and had just turned eighteen, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. From then on, she resolved to dedicate her life to the noble cause of communism.
    The Party's rectification movement was a profound education and exercise for her, further clarifying that to truly become an intellectual of the working class, one must be "both red and expert." In the labor training on the construction site last year, she mingled with the workers, worked hard, and actively learned practical production knowledge. In less than a month, she reached the quota and was praised by the masses. It is in this way that she has gradually grown up along the road of being both red and expert under the education and cultivation of the Party.
    Inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Xu Yongji is leaping towards new goals. In the last two months of this year, she is determined to muster even greater efforts. In addition to ensuring that she overfulfills her design task by 15%, she will also complete two scientific research projects.

    向“尖端”顽强进军
    ——记陕西省青年技术员徐永基的先进事迹
    天大的困难挡不住共产党员
    1956年9月，徐永基怀着一颗建设祖国的火热的心，离开了大学，走上了设计工作岗位——建筑工程部西北工业建筑设计院。来到设计院不久，党委就指派总工程师负责给徐永基等同志讲解“薄壳”技术；接着，党又把研究“薄壳结构设计”的任务交给了她。“薄壳结构设计”是建筑科学中的尖端技术，是一种很薄的、弯曲形的大型建筑构件，一般用作屋面，可以节省大量的钢材和水泥。徐永基知道，要掌握这种技术，困难很多，需要有高深的数学、力学知识。过去我国掌握这种技术的人很少，就是现在也才是开始研究应用。但她一想到采用这种技术能够给国家节约大量建筑材料、提高建筑技术和丰富建筑造型艺术时，就勇敢地接受了这个任务，下定决心攻克这个尖端技术堡垒。
    要攻破这个堡垒，是没有平坦的大道可走的；对徐永基这个刚出校门的青年人来说，就更有不少的“拦路虎”。有时要弄清楚一篇技术资料，就需要应用几十个公式，而每一个公式都要经过数十步的演算。为了解决一个疑难，往往要到处寻找、翻阅很多外国原文参考书，有俄、英、法、德文，甚至有捷克文、波兰文，而她的外文基础又很差，读起来相当吃力。有人风言风语地说：“刚出学校的毛孩子，搞这样重要的技术研究工作，能搞出什么名堂来？”当时，她也产生过一些畏难情绪，可是她又想：“自己是个共产党员，难道在困难面前退缩吗？不！困难算什么，天大的困难也动摇不了共产党员的坚强意志。”这样一想，力量就来了。只要有关于“薄壳”研究的书籍、文章、资料，她都认真地研究。一遍看不懂，两遍、三遍，直到弄懂为止。仅在钻研“圆柱形薄壳”设计时，她就学习了苏联建筑力学计算方法、德国数学分析方法等七种技术资料，演算了七百多个公式。对不懂的外文，她就搬出字典来查。她还经常利用晚上业余时间，到往返二十多里路的学校学习高等数学。去年她到工地劳动锻炼，也没有中断过学习；往往白天劳动了一天，还利用晚上的时间学习。她不仅自己钻研，而且能够虚心地请教周围的同志。就这样，经过两年多的时间，她学会和掌握了“柱形薄壳”、“双曲薄壳”、“折板式薄壳”等九种薄壳设计理论，在攻克尖端技术的道路上迈进了一大步。
      敢做别人没有做过的事
    徐永基在掌握了“薄壳”设计的基本理论之后，并没有停步不前。她在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，敢想敢作，大胆革新，虚心学习先进经验，创造性地进行设计。去年12月，院里承担了一个电缆厂的设计任务。在进行设计时，党号召大搞“土洋结合”，节约钢材、水泥，用砖盖成厂房。这项设计虽然不是徐永基所在小组的任务，但她认识到给国家节约建筑材料，是每个设计工作者应有的责任，她便积极响应了党的号召，利用业余时间，和小组同志共同研究如何利用“薄壳”的结构来设计这个厂房。徐永基曾经从杂志上看到匈牙利试验的“无拉力砖薄壳”，使她知道了用砖代替钢材、水泥，也可以作成“薄壳”。但是究竟如何用砖壳组成屋面系统，还不清楚。她又从另一本杂志上，看到了苏联的“板式组合屋面”，就和小组同志共同研究，吸取了苏联的“组合屋面”形式和匈牙利的“砖薄壳”结构，创造性地设计成功了“无拉力砖薄壳组合屋面”。但是这种薄壳的曲面如何计算还没有现成公式。她又经过多次试算，和组内同志研究，并请教工程师，终于计算成功了。这种构件，技术先进，可以节约钢材20％到40％。
    今年8月，西北工业建筑设计院接到一项很大的油池设计任务。这种设计过去从没搞过，技术比较复杂，当时有的同志就不敢接受。徐永基听说这样大的油池，国内外过去都是用钢板作池壁的，就想到如果能用其他材料来代替，就可以给国家节约大量钢材。于是她便和小组的同志研究，主动要求领导上把这个任务交给他们，并大胆地提出了用“钢筋混凝土薄壳”代替钢板作池壁的设计方案。方案提出后，有些同志说：“这样大的油池，用钢筋混凝土作不保险，出了事故谁负责？”个别人甚至还故意刁难她。这时，党委批判了这些不正确的思想，坚决支持了徐永基的设计方案。党委书记说：“要勇于大胆革新，要敢做别人没有做过的事情。”这些话给了她极大鼓舞，增加了她大胆创造的勇气。她经过反复研究，终于胜利地完成了这项工程的设计，比钢板结构可以节约钢材50％。
    徐永基并不满足自己的成就，创造性的设计不断涌现。她和小组的同志出色地用薄壳结构完成了跨度三十八米、长六十二米的临潼游泳池的设计，比钢结构可以节约钢材一百吨；在今年全国预应力和钢筋混凝土会议上认为这种设计是有发展前途的新技术。在一个展览馆的工程设计中，她又设计成功了三十米“曲线预应力配筋薄壳”，解决了大跨度的下垂和裂缝问题。
      发展“薄壳”计算方法
    建筑结构的计算，是建筑设计的重要依据。要使一项工程设计得经济、适用、安全，就要有精确的计算。“薄壳结构设计”的计算，就更为复杂，而且有许多计算没有现成的计算方法。为了简化“薄壳结构”的计算，解决一些无法计算的疑难问题，徐永基在创造性地设计过程中，创造出了三种新的计算方法。
    今年3月，徐永基参加了一个展览馆的工程设计。当时，任务紧迫，要求按期出图。而这项工程的教育馆设计采用“双曲旋转薄壳”，如果用过去的计算法，单设计这个馆的屋面，就要花费十天。如何简化计算方法，就成为加速设计进度的一个关键问题。但要改变历来应用的计算方法，并不是轻而易举的。况且她正患着慢性肺炎，看书多了就头昏眼花。但当她一想到工地上千万工人没有图纸就不能施工时，她就忘掉了医生让她休息一个月的嘱咐，和大家一道奋战了五天，终于找到了计算双曲旋转薄壳的办法，工效提高了一倍，而且精确可靠。就这样，她和同志们一起，共同努力，使展览馆工程设计，提前十天完成了任务。
    还在去年8月的时候，西北工业建筑设计院的技术研究小组，就试制成功了“波浪型薄壳”屋面。这种结构比“圆柱型薄壳”更加节约钢材、减少施工工序。但计算相当复杂，而且还没有现成的计算办法。在设计成功之后，曾有一位同志采用常用的计算办法，计算过多次，都没有算出来。因而这个问题一年来一直是个“谜”。如何解破这个“谜”，使试制成功的先进结构能很快地应用到设计上去，就时刻在徐永基的脑子里盘旋。她在参加展览馆的工程设计中得到启发，觉得运用某一种方法可以计算“波浪型薄壳”，就运用这种办法，反复试算，但计算了三次都没有成功。计算一次要付出多么巨大的劳动呀！最长的一次她曾用了一个多月的时间，最短的也得一个多星期。如果错一个数字或符号，就前功尽弃。遇着一个疑难，就得翻资料、查字典，但她坚定地相信：失败是成功之母，只要有决心，就一定能够成功。果然，第四次就计算成功了。
    徐永基深切地体会到，创造一项新的设计、一个新的计算方法，是多么不易呀！因而一旦创造成功，她总是想很快推广出去，使大家都能掌握。当兄弟单位的同志来西北工业建筑设计院学习“薄壳”技术时，她就抽时间把自己的笔记整理出来给他们看，对不懂的地方详细给他们讲，帮助他们很快地掌握了这项新的技术。她还把自己的创造写出了六篇科学研究论文（有四篇是和其他同志合写的），其中有两篇是陕西省科学研究院1959年科学研究项目。
    沿着又红又专的大道前进
    徐永基能够经常鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研，作出出色的成绩，是因为她在党的教育培养下，能够认真地学习政治、改造思想，不断地巩固建设社会主义和为工人阶级服务的人生观。当她进入大学以后，在党的教育帮助下，逐渐明确了读书的目的是为了建设社会主义，而不是为了个人名利，因而她在各方面的表现都很突出，曾数次被评为“三好”优秀学生。当她在大学二年级、刚满十八岁的时候，就光荣地参加了中国共产党。从此，她下定决心，把自己的一生献给崇高的共产主义事业。
    党的整风运动，对她是一次深刻的教育和锻炼，使她进一步明确了要真正成为一个工人阶级的知识分子，必须“又红又专”。在去年下放工地劳动锻炼中，她和工人群众打成一片，努力劳动，积极学习实际生产知识，不到一个月的时间，就达到了定额，受到了群众的赞扬。她就是这样在党的教育培养下，沿着又红又专的道路，逐步成长起来的。
  在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，徐永基正在向新的目标跃进。在今年最后两个月内，她决心鼓足更大的干劲，除保证超额15％完成设计任务以外，还要完成两项科学研究项目。
