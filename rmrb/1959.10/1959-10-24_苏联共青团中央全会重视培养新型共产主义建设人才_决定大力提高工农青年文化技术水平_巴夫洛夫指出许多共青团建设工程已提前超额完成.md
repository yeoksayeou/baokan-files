Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League held its Sixth Plenary Session from the 20th to the 22nd to discuss the tasks of the Komsomol organizations in improving the general education and cultural and technical level of young Soviet workers and peasants.

    Pavlov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol, made a report on this issue at the meeting.

    Pavlov pointed out that the guarantees put forward by the Soviet Komsomol at the Thirteenth Congress and the Fourth Plenary Session of the Komsomol Central Committee are being successfully realized.

    He said that the Komsomol organizations originally guaranteed to build seven blast furnaces, and thanks to the active support of the Komsomol members, nine have been built; originally three open-hearth furnaces were to be built, but eight have already been put into production; nine coke ovens, eleven rolling mills and pipe rolling workshops have been built. In addition, Komsomol members have collected 4.5 million tons of scrap iron.

    Pavlov pointed out that more than 1.5 million young workers have completed the task of increasing labor productivity ahead of schedule, and the Komsomol members in the rural areas across the country have also made great achievements. According to the resolution of the Thirteenth Congress of the Komsomol, more than 600,000 people were sent to participate in animal husbandry work.

    The reporter pointed out that general education night schools will become the main form of obtaining secondary education. He said that in the seven years from 1959 to 1965, the number of students in night schools in cities will more than double, while the number of students in senior classes of night schools in rural areas will increase nine times.

    Pavlov pointed out that the composition of university students in the higher education system has also changed: more than one-third of university students are young people with practical work experience.

    Pavlov said that Soviet youth are carrying out a movement to strive for communist labor methods. In industry and agriculture, more than 150,000 collectives have participated in the competition for the title of Communist Labor Brigade. About 300,000 young men and women are striving for the title of Communist Labor Shock Worker.

    Pavlov said that helping young people improve their cultural and technical level is the most important task of carrying out communist education for the growing generation of young people. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Komsomol suggested that during 1959-1960, at least 15,000 to 20,000 Komsomol members should be sent to work in libraries, and at least 3,000 to 4,000 of them should participate in scientific and technological libraries.

    Those who spoke during the discussion of the report included Maksarev, Chairman of the State Scientific and Technological Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Yelyutin, Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education of the Soviet Union, who were invited to attend the plenary session.

    After discussing Pavlov's report, the plenary session pointed out that in order to realize the program of communist construction formulated by the 21st Congress of the CPSU, it is necessary to attach equal importance to establishing and using new technical equipment and cultivating new-type personnel who actively participate in communist construction.

    The plenary session announced the launch of an all-Soviet Komsomol movement to strive to improve the general education and cultural and technical level of young workers and peasants, and determined the main tasks of this movement.

    The plenary session pointed out that it is necessary to help employed young people prepare to enter general night schools, higher and secondary specialized schools, and suggested that the Komsomol organizations cooperate with the national education authorities to establish preparatory classes and groups for young people in enterprises, collective farms, and state farms who do not leave their jobs.

    The plenary session also suggested widely using various social forms of educating young people, such as universities of cultural technology and advanced experience, agronomy and animal husbandry training courses, district schools, and night schools for agricultural mechanics. Organize scientific and technological majors in cultural universities; organize groups of technology enthusiasts in local branches of scientific and technological associations, clubs, cultural palaces, and museums. The plenary session also discussed the completion of the labor guarantees proposed by the Komsomol organizations regarding the participation of young people in the development of the national economy.

    苏联共青团中央全会重视培养新型共产主义建设人才
    决定大力提高工农青年文化技术水平
    巴夫洛夫指出许多共青团建设工程已提前超额完成
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会于20日至22日举行了第六次全体会议，讨论共青团组织在提高苏联工农青年的普通教育和文化技术水平方面的任务。
    苏联共青团中央委员会第一书记巴夫洛夫在会上就这一问题作了报告。
    巴夫洛夫指出，苏联共青团在第十三次代表大会和共青团第四次中央全会上提出的保证正在顺利地实现。
    他说，共青团组织原来保证要建造七个高炉，由于共青团员的积极支持，已经建成了九个；原来要建造三个平炉，结果已经有八个投入了生产；建造了九座炼焦炉，十一座轧钢机和轧管车间。此外共青团员还收集了四百五十万吨废铁。
    巴夫洛夫指出，一百五十多万青年工人提前完成了提高劳动生产率的任务，全国农村的共青团员也取得了巨大成就。根据共青团第十三次代表大会的决议，派出了六十多万人参加畜牧业工作。
    报告人指出，普通教育夜校将成为获得中等教育的主要形式。他说，在1959—1965年七年中，各城市夜校的学生人数将增加一倍多，而农村夜校高级班的学生人数将增加九倍。
    巴夫洛夫指出，目前高等教育系统中大学生成份也发生了变化：在大学生中有三分之一以上是有实际工作经验的青年。
    巴夫洛夫说，苏联青年正在开展争取共产主义劳动方式的运动。在工农业中，已经有十五万个以上的集体参加了争取共产主义劳动队称号的竞赛。约有三十万左右男女青年在争取共产主义劳动突击手的称号。
    巴夫洛夫说，帮助青年提高文化技术水平是对正在成长中的青年一代进行共产主义教育的最重要的任务。因此，共青团中央建议，在1959—1960年期间，至少要派一万五千到二万名共青团员参加图书馆的工作，其中至少有三千到四千人参加科学技术图书馆的工作。
    在讨论报告时发言的有应邀出席全会的苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会主席马克萨烈夫、苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫、苏联高等和中等专业教育部长叶留金。
    全会在讨论了巴夫洛夫的报告以后指出，在实现苏共第二十一次代表大会所拟定的共产主义建设纲领时，必须同样重视建立和利用新的技术装备和培养新型的、积极参加共产主义建设的工作人员。
    全会宣布掀起一个全苏共青团争取提高工农青年普通教育和文化技术水平的运动，并确定了这个运动的主要任务。
    全会指出，必须帮助就业青年准备进入普通夜校、高等和中等专科学校，并建议共青团组织协同国民教育机关为不脱产的企业、集体农庄和国营农场的青年建立预备班和小组。
    全会还建议广泛利用各种教育青年的社会形式，例如文化技术和先进经验大学、农艺和畜牧专修班、区立学校、农业机械师夜校等。在文化大学里组织科学和技术的专业；在科学技术协会地方分会、俱乐部、文化宫、博物馆组织技术爱好者的小组。全会还讨论了共青团组织提出的关于青年参加发展国民经济的劳动保证的完成情况。（附图片）
