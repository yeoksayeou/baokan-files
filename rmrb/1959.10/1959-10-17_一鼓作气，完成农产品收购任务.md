Finish the Agricultural Product Procurement Task in One Go

　　With the autumn crops successively ripening and coming onto the market, the peak season for agricultural product procurement has arrived. The 1959 agricultural product procurement work has distinct characteristics from the start: early action, tight grip, meticulous attention to detail, high mass enthusiasm, and rapid procurement progress. The national procurement progress for grain and cotton is more than a month ahead of last year, and the procurement progress for oilseeds, flue-cured tobacco, and jute is also faster than last year. Some regions, such as Guizhou Province, have already completed the annual grain purchase task, and the grain stored in Sichuan Province accounts for more than 90% of the annual purchase task; many counties in several provinces (regions) have completely or overfulfilled the grain purchase task. All these facts indicate that the overall situation of agricultural and sideline product procurement this year is very good, and a procurement upsurge has already formed in most areas. The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a good job in the 1959 agricultural product procurement work require that the procurement of agricultural products should concentrate efforts and be completed in one go. In order to achieve this requirement, all localities must, while doing a good job in the "Three Autumns" work, continue their efforts and launch the procurement campaign centered on grain, cotton, and oilseeds to a greater climax, striving to comprehensively and overfulfill the agricultural product procurement task in a relatively short period.
　　Doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural products and agricultural by-products has great economic and political significance. Grain, cotton, and oil are basic necessities, related to the food and clothing of the people across the country. Agricultural and sideline products are also important raw materials for light industry and handicrafts, which play an extremely important role in industrial development and market prosperity. Agricultural and sideline products also account for a considerable proportion of export goods. For rural areas, doing a good job in procurement enables the people's communes to increase more funds, which can be used to purchase agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides, as well as further improve the lives of the commune members. Therefore, the procurement of agricultural and sideline products is related to the improvement of people's lives and the development of production, and is related to industry, commerce, and agriculture. It not only affects the current national economy, but also is an important condition for the continued great leap forward of the national economy next year, and an important condition for taking the initiative in all work.
　　For most areas, the second half of October and the entire month of November are the decisive period for completing the procurement work. Is it possible to comprehensively and overfulfill the 1959 agricultural product procurement task, especially the procurement task of grain, cotton, and oilseeds, in a relatively short period? Like other tasks, the agricultural product procurement work this year has very favorable conditions. Although some areas have suffered from serious floods and droughts this year, agricultural production has still achieved a great harvest thanks to the heroic struggle of the masses in draining water and combating drought, and the output of agricultural products will increase compared with 1958. Since the beginning of this year's autumn harvest, all localities have repeatedly educated farmers on careful harvesting and returning every grain to the granary, and the harvesting of crops has been more meticulous than in previous years. With more harvested and finer threshing, the procurement work has a good material foundation. This year, the people's communes, after rectification and consolidation, have further demonstrated their superiority. Under the condition that the people's communes uniformly allocate manpower and materials according to the principle of equal value exchange, it is entirely possible to do a good job in both the "Three Autumns" work and the procurement of agricultural products. In particular, since the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, anti-rightist sentiment has been stirred up on all fronts, and the broad masses are in high spirits, and a brand-new atmosphere has emerged in all work, which will also promote the agricultural product procurement work.
　　The political and economic situation is extremely good, and the objective conditions are very favorable; but this does not mean that the agricultural product procurement work can be waited for to be accomplished. The procurement work in the past period has achieved great success, but from the entire procurement process, it is only the beginning stage and only achieved initial victory. To implement it from beginning to end and complete the procurement task quickly and well, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses more widely, and launch a vigorous and down-to-earth greater upsurge in agricultural product procurement.
　　In order to launch a greater upsurge in agricultural product procurement, all aspects must universally and actively take action. The overall situation of the current procurement work is good, but there is an imbalance between different regions. In addition to the different harvesting seasons, there are also significant differences in the proper arrangement of work and the thoroughness of mobilizing the masses. In a few places, the procurement campaign has not yet formed an upsurge. Even in places where the upsurge has already risen, there are still imbalances between grass-roots units. According to typical surveys in some places, the vast majority of grass-roots procurement units have actively taken action and fully mobilized the masses, and the progress is rapid, but there are still 10% to 20% of the units that are slow to act, the masses have not been fully mobilized, and the task is not well completed. At the same time, the procurement situation of various varieties is also unbalanced: the procurement progress of cotton is faster and has already formed an upsurge; the procurement upsurge of grain, oilseeds, flue-cured tobacco, jute, etc. has just begun and needs to be accelerated. Therefore, all localities should immediately conduct an inspection, find problems, solve them quickly, and help the backward areas catch up. Only by changing this unbalanced situation can the procurement work be accelerated and a situation of comprehensive leap forward be formed.
　　To complete the procurement work in one go in a short period, it is necessary to grasp politics and ideology, vigorously publicize the general line, continue to oppose rightism and boost morale, and further launch a vigorous mass movement. It is necessary to educate the broad masses on the alliance between workers and peasants, publicize the great significance of rural areas supporting cities and supporting socialist construction, and at the same time publicize the state's procurement policies and the principles of running communes diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily. It is necessary to publicize not only through meetings, but also through other means, not only to commune cadres, but also to the broad masses of commune members. Through extensive and in-depth publicity and education work, it is necessary to further promote the patriotic enthusiasm and socialist construction enthusiasm of the broad masses, so that they can quickly sell a sufficient amount of agricultural products to the state. The success or failure of the procurement work is closely related to the efforts of the cadres. If the cadres have high political awareness and great enthusiasm, the progress of procurement will be fast, otherwise, the progress will be slow.
　　At present, in areas where the procurement work is slow, some cadres have a fear of difficulty, and in areas where the progress is fast, some cadres have developed a sense of relaxation. The fear of difficulty is mainly due to not seeing the objectively favorable situation and not seeing the strength of the masses and the enthusiasm for selling agricultural products. Therefore, this emotion should be thoroughly criticized on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, so that they can change their attitude and take active action. For some cadres who have developed a sense of relaxation, they should be educated not to be satisfied with the existing achievements, point out the difficulties that may be encountered in future work, point out that the procurement of agricultural products often becomes more difficult in the later stages, requiring more enthusiasm and more in-depth and meticulous work, and encourage them to complete the procurement task in one go. It is necessary to criticize the fear of difficulty and the sense of relaxation, which are manifestations of rightist thought. It is necessary to advocate learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, and launch a vigorous red flag competition movement.
　　In order to make the agricultural product procurement movement develop healthily, it is necessary to be both vigorous and down-to-earth. Therefore, in the movement, it is necessary to conscientiously implement policies, strive to purchase all that should be purchased, without buying "excess grain." In the statistics of the procurement quantity, it is necessary to be realistic and strive for accuracy. Attention should be paid to the quality of various products to be purchased. At the same time, various advanced experiences should also be promoted. When Henan Province arranged the summer grain purchase task this year, it arranged the transportation routes and locations at the same time, thus reducing roundabout transportation, saving more than 28 million labor days, and saving more than 13 million yuan in expenses, which is a very good experience. There are many advanced experiences in all aspects of the procurement work, which should be vigorously promoted. Attention should also be paid to technological innovation in transportation tools, processing equipment, etc. In short, the agricultural product procurement work also requires a combination of hard work and clever work, in order to speed up the progress and achieve better results.
　　After communes, production teams, and farmers sell agricultural products, they will receive a large amount of cash, and commercial departments should promptly allocate goods to rural areas to meet the needs of rural areas for means of production and daily necessities. The principle of commodity allocation should be to resolutely allocate what rural areas need to rural areas, and prioritize meeting the needs of rural areas for what both rural and urban areas need. Allocating industrial products to rural areas is an important part of urban-rural mutual assistance, and will also have a positive supporting role in the procurement of agricultural products. In order to increase the production of more commodities to supply rural areas, it is particularly important to actively support industrial departments, handicraft departments, and industrial departments of people's communes to increase production and expand sources of goods. Commercial departments must strive to do this work well. The People's Bank of China should ensure a sufficient supply of procurement funds.
　　Now, the agricultural product procurement work has entered a decisive stage. Various business departments, including grain, commerce, finance, banks, and transportation departments, should further mobilize, cooperate closely under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and at the same time rely on the broad masses and rural cadres, work together, and further launch a greater procurement upsurge centered on grain, cotton, and oilseeds nationwide, and strive to complete and overfulfill the agricultural product procurement task in a short period.

### 一鼓作气，完成农产品收购任务

　　一鼓作气，完成农产品收购任务
    大秋作物先后成熟，陆续登场。收购农产品的旺季已经到来了。1959年度农产品的收购工作一开始就具有明显的特点：动手早，抓得紧，抓得细，群众热情高，收购进度快。全国粮食、棉花的收购进度比去年提前了一个多月，油料、烤烟、黄麻的收购进度也都比去年为快。有些地区如贵州省已完成全年粮食征购任务，四川省入库的粮食已占全年征购任务的90％以上；若干省（区）的许多县已经全部完成或超额完成粮食征购任务。种种事实表明，今年农副产品收购的总的情况好得很，大部分地区收购高潮已经形成。中共中央和国务院关于作好1959年度农产品收购工作的指示中，要求农产品的收购要集中力量，一气呵成。为了实现这个要求，各地在做好“三秋”工作的同时，必须再接再厉，一鼓作气把以粮、棉、油料为中心的收购运动推向更大的高潮，力争在较短时间内全面和超额完成农产品收购任务。
    作好农产品和农业副产品的收购工作，有着极大的经济意义和政治意义。粮、棉、油是基本生活资料，关系全国人民吃饭穿衣问题。农副产品又是轻工业和手工业的重要原料，对于工业的发展和市场的繁荣有着极为重要的作用。在出口物资中，农副产品也占相当大的比重。而对农村来说，作好了收购工作，人民公社就能够增加更多的资金，既可以用来购买农业机械、化肥和农药等生产资料，也可以进一步改善社员的生活。因此，农副产品的收购工作，既关系人民生活的提高，又关系生产的发展，既与工业有关，又与商业、农业有关，不仅对当前国民经济发生影响，而且是明年国民经济继续大跃进的重要条件，是一切工作都取得主动的重要条件。
    10月下半月和整个11月份，对绝大部分地区来说，是完成收购工作的决定性时期。在比较短的时期内全面超额完成1959年度农产品的收购任务，特别是粮、棉、油料的收购任务，有没有可能呢？如同其它各项工作一样，今年农产品的收购工作，具有十分有利的条件。今年部分地区虽然曾经遭受严重的水旱灾害，但是经过广大群众的英勇奋战，排涝抗旱，农业生产仍然获得了大丰收，农产品的产量将比1958年有所增加。今年秋收开始，各地就向农民反复进行了精打细收、颗粒还仓的教育，农作物的收割比往年更加细致。收得多，打得细，收购工作就有了很好的物质基础。今年，人民公社经过整顿和巩固，优越性更加发挥出来，在人民公社按照等价交换的原则统一调拨人力、物力的条件下，完全可以做到既搞好“三秋”工作，又做好农产品的收购工作。特别是党的八届八中全会的决议公布以来，各个战线上反右倾，鼓干劲，广大群众意气风发，各项工作都出现崭新的气象，这种非常良好的形势也将对农产品的收购工作起到促进的作用。
    政治经济形势极为良好，客观条件十分有利；但这并不是说，农产品的收购工作因此可以坐待其成。过去一个时期的收购工作获得很大成绩，但从整个收购过程来说，还只是开始阶段，只是取得了初步的胜利。要想贯彻始终，又快又好地完成收购任务，各级党委必须加强领导，更广泛地发动群众，掀起一个轰轰烈烈而又踏踏实实的农产品收购的更大高潮。
    为了掀起农产品收购的更大高潮，必须各个方面普遍地积极地行动起来。目前收购工作的总情况是好的，但各个地区之间是不平衡的。除了收获季节先后不同的原因以外，在工作安排的妥善和发动群众的深透等方面，也有悬殊的差别。在少数地方，收购运动还没有形成高潮。就是在高潮已经起来的地方，基层单位之间也还有不平衡的现象。据有些地方的典型调查，绝大部分的基层收购单位已经积极行动起来，充分发动了群众，进度很快，但仍有10％—20％的单位行动迟缓，群众没有充分发动起来，任务完成得不好。同时，各个品种的收购情况也不平衡：棉花收购进度较快，已经形成高潮；粮食、油料、烤烟、黄麻等的收购高潮刚刚开始，还需要加快速度。因此，各地应该立即进行一次检查，发现问题，迅速解决，帮助落后的地方赶上前来。只有改变了这种不平衡的状况，收购工作才能加快速度，形成全面跃进的局势。
    使收购工作在短期内一气呵成，必须要抓政治、抓思想，大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动。要向广大群众进行工农联盟的教育，宣传农村支援城市、支援社会主义建设的重大意义，同时宣传国家的收购政策，宣传勤俭办公社、勤俭持家的道理。不仅要通过会议宣传，也要通过其他方式宣传，不仅要向公社干部宣传，同时要向广大社员群众宣传。要通过广泛的深入的宣传教育工作，进一步发扬广大群众的爱国主义热情和建设社会主义的积极性，使他们迅速地把足够数量的农产品卖给国家。收购工作的好坏，和干部的努力程度有很大关系。干部政治觉悟高，干劲大，收购的进展就快，反之，就进展迟缓。
　　目前，在收购工作进度慢的地区，某些干部有着畏难情绪，进度快的地区，某些干部又产生了松劲情绪。畏难情绪的产生，主要是没有看清客观有利形势，没有看到群众的力量和出售农产品的积极性。因此，应该在充分发动群众的基础上，对这种情绪加以彻底批判，使他们转变态度，积极行动起来。对于某些产生松劲情绪的干部，要教育他们不要满足已有的成绩，指明今后工作中可能遇到的困难，指明农产品的收购往往越到后期工作越艰巨，越需要鼓足干劲，越需要进行深入的细致的工作，鼓励他们一鼓作气地完成收购任务。必须批判畏难情绪和松劲情绪，这些都是右倾思想的表现。必须提倡学先进、比先进、赶先进，掀起轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛运动。
    为了使农产品收购运动健康地发展，既要轰轰烈烈，也要扎扎实实。因此，在运动中必须认真执行政策，努力把应该收购的都收购起来，而又不买“过头粮”。在收购数量的统计方面，必须实事求是，力求准确。收购各种产品都要注意质量。同时也应该推广各种先进经验。河南省今年布置夏季粮食征购任务的时候，把调运路线和地点同时作了安排，因此减少了迂回运输，节省了劳动日二千八百多万个，节省了费用一千三百多万元，就是一个很好的经验。在收购工作的各个环节，都有不少的先进经验，应该大力推广。在运输工具、加工设备等方面，也应当注意技术革新。总之，农产品的收购工作同样需要大干苦干与巧干相结合，以便加快进度，取得更好的效果。
    公社、生产队和农民在出售农产品以后，将会得到大量现金，商业部门应该及时调拨商品下乡，以满足农村对生产资料和生活日用品的需要。商品调拨的原则，应当是农村需要的坚决调拨农村，农村和城市都需要的，应当优先满足农村的需要。调拨工业品下乡，这是城乡互助的重要内容，对农产品的收购也将发生积极的支援作用。为了增产更多的商品供应农村，特别重要的是积极支持工业部门、手工业部门和人民公社的工业部门增加生产，扩大货源，商业部门必须努力作好这一工作。人民银行应当保证收购资金的充足供应。
    现在，农产品收购工作已经进入决定性的阶段。各个业务部门包括粮食、商业、财政、银行、交通运输等部门，应当进一步动员起来，在党委的统一领导下密切协作，同时依靠广大群众和农村干部，共同努力，在全国范围内进一步开展一个以粮、棉、油料为中心的更大的收购高潮，为在短期内完成和超额完成农产品的收购任务而奋斗。
