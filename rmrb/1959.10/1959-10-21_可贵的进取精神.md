    Commendable Enterprising Spirit
    Hua Runlu
    In the competitive upsurge of "advancing at high speed into 1960," young workers in Beijing are learning from and catching up with a young female worker named Liu Yajun. She is a second-grade lathe operator at the Changxindian Communications Factory, eighteen years old this year, and a member of the Communist Youth League. Such a young female worker is naturally not a veteran with rich experience, but she is young with great ambition, high enthusiasm, and full of energy, and no one can underestimate her. It has only been a little over two years since she entered the factory as a worker wearing a "red scarf," and only a few months since she became a formal worker. However, in the sixteen months since she started working independently, she has completed fifty-seven months of work. By September of this year, she had already stepped into 1963, and now she is striding forward towards 1964.
    Perhaps some people do not believe that an eighteen-year-old girl is so capable? However, those who have been to the Changxindian Communications Factory and have seen Liu Yajun operate cannot help but respect this female worker who still has a childlike face. In her, many excellent qualities of the Chinese working class are condensed, and communist sparks are shining in her mind. Seeing Liu Yajun, you will feel that this is a red flower among the thousands of flowers cultivated and nurtured by our party. It blooms brightly, grows vigorously, has deep roots and lush foliage, and is so lovable!
    Liu Yajun is a role model for young people to learn from. Young workers in Beijing want to "learn from Yajun, catch up with Yajun, and march towards 1960," and all young people across the country should learn from Liu Yajun. What should we learn from her? First, learn her ambition. Since she was a child, Liu Yajun has been determined to be a worker, and after becoming a worker, she was determined to be an advanced pacesetter in socialist construction, creating more wealth for the country. She not only thought this way, but also did it earnestly, without any ambiguity. She wanted to learn technology and master machine operation, so she studied hard and practiced repeatedly dozens of times; she wanted to be the master of time, not letting time slip away from her hands in vain, so she carefully calculated how many minutes and seconds a job would take, and seized a lot of time; she wanted to "complete three days' tasks in one day," so she would not give up until she achieved her goal. It is this ambition, this stubbornness, that makes Liu Yajun full of revolutionary vigor and energy. Is this not very valuable? Second, learn her "daring spirit." Liu Yajun can be regarded as a newborn calf. Not only is she not "afraid of tigers," but she is also not intimidated by anything. Her "daring spirit" is not reckless, but a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do in her work. She dares to accept the most complex tasks, she dares to innovate technology, and she also dares to admit and improve her shortcomings. Liu Yajun said: "With the leadership of the Party, we dare to do anything!" The Party wants young people to hold high the banner of the General Line and move forward, so Liu Yajun suddenly broke through to 1963. How valuable is this "daring spirit"! Third, learn her spirit of humility and eagerness to learn. Liu Yajun's progress is so fast, and diligent study is an important reason. She learns from her masters, and also learns from her companions; she learns at work, and also learns in her spare time. She never lets go of any learning opportunity, just like a bee collecting pollen, extracting every bit of sweet juice into herself.
    There are indeed many things worth learning from Liu Yajun. However, I feel that what is even more valuable is her enterprising spirit of striding forward and facing difficulties. Liu Yajun is very young and has little experience, but she has created such extraordinary achievements. It would be impossible without a spirit of continuous progress. Liu Yajun is never satisfied with her existing progress. She demands strictness of herself, is meticulous, and does everything in one go, forging ahead courageously. After doing simple work, she wants to do complex work; after completing the task, she is not satisfied, but wants to complete it ahead of schedule and exceed the quota, and even cries when she exceeds the quota by too little. This is the precious heroic spirit of a revolutionary youth, and the attitude that a communist new person should have. Her constantly leaping enterprising spirit is not for herself, but for the collective; it is not to reach out to the country for something, but to create wealth for the country, and to create it as much as possible, as quickly as possible, and without end. This noble enterprising spirit should be learned and carried forward by every young person.

    可贵的进取精神
    华润露
    在“高速度跨进1960年”的竞赛热潮中，北京的青年工人们正在学习和追赶着一个名叫刘雅君的青年女工。她是长辛店通信工厂的二级车工，今年十八岁，是个共青团员。这样一位年轻的女工，自然不可能是老有经验的战将，可是她人小志气大，热情高、干劲足，谁也不能小看她。从她戴着“红领巾”进厂当工人，才有两年多的历史，成为正式工人只不过几个月的时间，但她在独立工作以来的十六个月中，却完成了五十七个月的工作量，到今年9月已经跨进了1963年，现在又大踏步地向1964年前进了。
    也许有人不相信，一个十八岁的姑娘竟然如此神通广大么？但是，到过长辛店通信工厂的人，参观过刘雅君操作的人，都不能不格外尊敬这位还带着满脸稚气的女工。在她的身上，凝结着我国工人阶级的许多优秀品质，思想上闪耀着共产主义的火花。看到刘雅君，你会感到这是我们党培养和浇灌出来的千千万万花朵中的一朵红花。它开得鲜艳，长得茁壮，根深叶茂，如此逗人喜爱！
    刘雅君是青年学习的榜样。北京的青年工人要“学雅君，赶雅君，向1960年大进军”，全国所有的青年都应该向刘雅君学习。向她学习什么呢？第一，学她的志气。刘雅君从小就立志去当工人，当了工人以后又立志做一名社会主义建设的先进标兵，为国家创造更多的财富。她不仅这样想，而且切实地做，一点也不含糊。她要学技术，掌握机器操作，于是就苦学苦钻，几次几十次地练习；她要做时间的主人，不让时间从自己的手中白白溜过，于是她就精心计算一个活需要几分几秒，夺取大量的时间；她要“三天任务一天完”，于是就不达目的不罢休。就是这种志气，就是这股子倔强劲，使刘雅君满身充沛着革命的朝气和热力。这难道不是十分可贵的吗？第二，要学她的“闯劲”。刘雅君可算是一个初生的牛犊，她不但不“怕虎”，而且什么事情都吓不倒她。她这股子“闯劲”，并不是横冲直闯，而是在工作中有着敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。她敢于接受最复杂的任务，她敢于革新技术，她也敢于承认和改进自己的缺点。刘雅君说：“有了党的领导，我们什么都敢做！”党要青年们高举总路线的旗帜前进，于是刘雅君一下子闯到1963年去了。这种“闯劲”，又是多么可贵！第三，要学她的谦虚好学精神。刘雅君进步得如此快，勤奋学习是一个重要原因。她向师傅们学，也向同伴们学；在工作中学，工作之余也学。她从不放过任何一个学习的机会，就像蜜蜂采集花粉一样，把一点一滴的甘美的汁液都汲取到自己身上来。
    在刘雅君身上，值得学习的东西确实不少。然而，我感到更加可贵的是她那种挺起胸膛，迎着困难走路的进取精神。刘雅君年纪很轻，经验不多，却创造了这样不平凡的事迹，如果没有一种不断上进的劲头，是办不到的。刘雅君从来都不满足已有的进步，她对自己要求严格，一丝不苟，做任何事情都是一鼓作气，勇往直前。她做了简单的工作，还想做复杂的工作；完成了任务，不满足，还要提前超额，甚至超额少了都急得哭。这是一个革命青年可贵的英雄精神，是共产主义新人应该具有的态度。她这种不断跃进的进取之心，不是为了个人，而是为了集体；不是伸手向国家讨取什么，而是动手为国家创造财富，并且创造得愈多愈好，愈快愈好，永无止境。这种高尚的进取精神，每一个青年都应该学习到手，发扬光大。
