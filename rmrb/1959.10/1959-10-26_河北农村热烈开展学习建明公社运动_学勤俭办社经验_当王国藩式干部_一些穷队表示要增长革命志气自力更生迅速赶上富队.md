(Reported by this newspaper) Hebei Province's many counties and people's communes are launching a campaign to learn from Jianming People's Commune (the commune where Wang Guofan is located) in Zunhua County. The broad masses of commune members are establishing ambitious goals, determined to run the people's communes even better and realize a great leap forward in agricultural production.

The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site meeting in Jianming Commune, introducing Jianming Commune's advanced experience in managing the commune diligently and frugally, and Comrade Wang Guofan's excellent work style. All counties in the city immediately launched a large-scale movement to learn from and catch up with Jianming Commune. According to statistics from Yutian, Ji County, Qian'an, Leting and other counties, more than 98,000 propagandists and reporters were organized to deeply publicize Jianming Commune's model deeds, educating more than 1,150,000 cadres and commune members. The Leting County Committee of the Communist Party of China has launched a movement to learn from and catch up with Jianming Commune, and is now conducting a major inspection and comparison, learning and acting simultaneously, setting off a new upsurge in production. The 450 production teams in Zunhua County have generally formulated plans to learn from and catch up with Jianming Commune, and production teams and commune members in seven communes have formulated frugal covenants. Dongjiuzhai Commune put forward the slogan of "100 Diligences and 100 Frugalities," and all 8,000 households in the commune have formulated covenants. After mass study and discussion, Tingliuhe Commune in Leting County, 274 small teams posted more than 3,100 big-character posters, put forward more than 1,020 opinions, and found more than 280 loopholes of extravagance and waste, with 6,430 commune members making frugality plans. In order to learn better, cadres from many counties and communes personally went to Jianming Commune to "learn from experience." The Rural Work Department of the Chengde Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China also sent people to systematically study the commune's experience, compile and print documents, and formulate specific measures for managing the commune diligently and frugally, and then introduced and promoted these measures. More than 500 cadres from Qian'an and Yutian counties have visited Jianming Commune to observe and study.

Many communes and production teams criticized the theory of "conditions determine everything" in the movement to learn from and catch up with Jianming Commune, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and commune members. The Chita Village Production Team of Shijingcun Commune in Hejian County, Tianjin, had relatively poor production conditions. Many commune members believed that their team's conditions were not good and that it was difficult to develop production. In response to this situation, the Party branch used the facts of Wang Guofan's diligent and frugal commune management to inspire the commune members' enthusiasm for production. Everyone agreed that the current production conditions were much better than when Wang Guofan initially started the commune with only three donkey legs. They unanimously expressed their determination to increase their revolutionary ambition, learn from Wang Guofan's commune, and resolve to become self-reliant in the short term and catch up with rich teams. The Party members and cadres of this production team conducted secret discussions among the commune members and launched a free airing of views and debate on how to change from poor to rich, whether to rely on self-reliance or rely on the state and others. The branch formulated a plan to "work hard for two years to catch up with the rich teams" and submitted it to the masses for discussion. After this great debate, the commune members also recognized the truth that "relief is limited, production is infinite," saw the conditions of their own team clearly, clarified the direction of their struggle, and unanimously proposed that everyone should be of one mind and turn poor Chita into a rich place.

Many counties and people's communes, after learning from Jianming Commune's movement to manage communes diligently and frugally, began to vigorously develop sideline production. Dazhongzhuang Commune in Baodi County reduced the expenditure on buying radios, bicycles and other items that could be delayed by 50,000 yuan, and launched a campaign among women commune members for each person to raise a pig, ten chickens, save 100 jin of grain, harvest 1,000 jin of vegetables, and accumulate 10,000 jin of fertilizer. The Xiacang Dalingshang Management Area in Ji County revised its production plan, increasing its daily income from sideline production from 4,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan. From October 11th to 14th, it has already earned more than 20,000 yuan.

The working style of the cadres and masses of Jianming Commune in following the mass line greatly inspired the people's communes in various places. The Party branch of Wenzhuang Brigade in Chengguan Commune, Leting County, established honor boards for Party members and cadres, inspected them every half month, and constantly improved their work style. Qiao Jianfu, the Party branch secretary of Dadingzhuang Production Team in Yutian County, proposed to strive to become a Wang Guofan-style cadre. The Yutian County Committee called on cadres of all communes and production teams to learn from Wang Guofan's class viewpoint and democratic style. Many cadres used Wang Guofan as an example to measure themselves and spur themselves on, determined to stand at the forefront of the great leap forward in production.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently issued a decision on launching a campaign to learn from the experience of Jianming People's Commune and run the people's communes in the province even better. From now on, all localities should closely integrate with the movement to increase production and practice economy, and immediately launch a widespread and in-depth movement to learn from Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County throughout the province through rectification of communes.

(Reported by this newspaper) Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County has once again achieved an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery this year. The commune members are jubilant and encouraged, determined to hold high the banner of the people's commune and diligent and frugal commune management, make persistent efforts, and vow to win even greater harvests this year and next year.

This year, the average yield per mu of grain crops in the entire commune reached 650 jin, an increase of 33% compared to last year; the average yield per mu of cotton can reach 55 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 26% compared to last year; the average yield per mu of peanuts increased by 60% compared to last year; vegetables, dried and fresh fruits all increased more than twofold compared to last year; the number of cattle, sheep and pigs increased by 26% to 68% compared to the same period last year. According to statistics at the end of September, the total income of the entire commune reached 3.7 million yuan, an average of 125 yuan per person, an increase of 13% compared to last year.

In this year's great production movement, the commune continued to carry forward the spirit of diligent and frugal commune management, relied on the strong strength of the people's commune, and overcame various natural disasters. During spring plowing and sowing, the commune encountered a drought. Inspired by the Party's general line, all commune members exerted great effort and devoted themselves fully to the fight against drought, developing water sources from multiple aspects, and completing the sowing task on time after more than 20 days of fierce fighting. In the summer, the commune encountered a heavy rain that had not been seen for decades. The commune members adopted a method of large-scale collaboration and immediately launched a disaster relief and seedling rescue movement. The various water conservancy projects of the commune also played a role in preventing floods, greatly reducing the disaster and ensuring an all-round bumper harvest.

The commune also formulated an overall plan, made rational use of natural resources, and increased income from multiple aspects. After communization, they not only adjusted the land and implemented planting according to local conditions, but also established a 50,000-mu cultivation area for apples, pears, dried fruits, etc., and developed livestock farms to 43 locations. For forestry, sideline production, fishery and other productions, specialized teams were established to be responsible for management according to the requirements of the production plan, and all productions were doing very well.

The all-round bumper harvest has inspired even greater efforts from all commune members, who unanimously expressed their determination to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of diligent and frugal commune management, and to absorb the advanced experience of fraternal communes to win even greater victories next year. Now, they are seizing the current good opportunity and have set off a new upsurge in production. In agriculture, they are strengthening wheat field management and vigorously engaging in accumulating and producing fertilizer in order to strive for even greater harvests next year. At the same time, a large number of laborers are being drawn to engage in 33 kinds of sideline production, determined to achieve the requirement of "work hard in the three months of winter and increase each person's income by another 20 yuan."

    河北农村热烈开展学习建明公社运动
    学勤俭办社经验　当王国藩式干部
    一些穷队表示要增长革命志气自力更生迅速赶上富队
    本报讯　河北省许多县和人民公社开展学习遵化县建明人民公社（王国藩所在社）的运动。广大社员立雄心，树大志，决心把人民公社办得更好，实现农业生产的大跃进。
    中共唐山市委最近在建明公社召开现场会议，介绍了建明公社勤俭办社的先进经验和社长王国藩的优良作风。全市各县立即展开了一个大规模的学、赶建明公社的运动。据玉田、蓟县、迁安、乐亭等县的统计，共组织宣传员、报告员九万八千多人，深入地宣传了建明公社的模范事迹，使一百一十五万多个干部、社员受到教育。中共乐亭县委已经开展学、赶建明公社的运动，现在正进行大检查、大评比，边学习、边行动，掀起了生产新高潮。遵化县四百五十个生产队，普遍制订了学、赶的计划，有七个公社的生产小队和社员制订了勤俭公约。东旧寨公社提出百勤百俭的口号，全社八千多户都制订了公约。乐亭县汀流河公社，经过群众性的学习讨论，二百七十四个小队，贴出大字报三千一百多张，提出意见一千零二十多条，找出铺张浪费漏洞二百八十多处，有六千四百三十个社员作了勤俭计划。为了学习得更好，许多县、公社的干部还亲自到建明公社去“取经”。中共承德地委农村工作部还派人到这个公社系统地学习经验、编印文件，制订勤俭办社的具体措施，然后介绍推广。迁安、玉田两县已有五百多名干部到过建明社参观学习。
    很多公社、生产队在学、赶建明社的运动中批判了唯条件论，进一步调动了广大干部和社员的积极性。生产条件较差的天津市河间县诗经村公社赤塔村生产队，许多社员认为自己队条件不好，发展生产有困难，针对这个情况，党支部用王国藩勤俭办社的事实启发了社员的生产积极性。大家一致认为，现在的生产条件比起王国藩当年初办社只有三条驴腿要强的多，一致表示要增长革命志气，学习王国藩社，决心在短期内自力更生，赶上富队。这个生产队的党员、干部们就在社员群众中进行串通酝酿，开展了一场怎样由穷变富，是自力更生，还是依赖国家、依赖旁人的鸣放辩论；支部作出了“苦干两年，赶上富裕队”的规划交给群众讨论。经过这场大辩论，社员群众也认清了“救济有限，生产无穷”的道理，看清了本队的条件，明确了奋斗方向，一致提出要大家一条心，把穷赤塔变成富疙瘩。
    许多县和人民公社，通过学习建明公社勤俭办社的运动后，开始了大搞副业生产。宝坻县大中庄公社削减了买收音机、自行车等可以缓买的开支五万元，在妇女社员中开展起每人养一口猪、十只鸡、节约百斤粮、多收千斤菜、积肥一万斤的运动。蓟县下仓大堼上管理区，修订了生产计划，把副业生产日收入四千元提高到六千元。从10月11日到14日，已收入两万多元。
    各地人民公社学习了建明公社干部群众路线的工作作风得到很大启示。乐亭县城关公社温庄大队党支部，建立了党员、干部光荣牌，每半月检查一次，不断改进工作作风。玉田县大丁庄生产队党支部书记乔建福，提出要努力当上王国藩式的干部。玉田县委号召各公社、生产队的干部都要学习王国藩的阶级观点和民主作风，很多干部用王国藩作榜样来衡量自己，鞭策自己，决心站在生产大跃进的最前列。
    中共河北省委已在最近发出关于开展学习建明人民公社的经验，把全省人民公社办得更好的决定。从现在起，各地应该密切结合增产节约运动，通过整社，立即在全省范围内开展一个广泛深入的学习遵化县建明人民公社的运动。
    本报讯　遵化县建明人民公社今年又获农林牧副渔全面大丰收。社员们欢欣鼓舞，要高举人民公社和勤俭办社的旗帜，再接再厉，誓夺今年和明年的更大丰收。
    今年全社粮食作物平均亩产达到六百五十斤，比去年增产33％；棉花平均每亩可产皮棉五十五斤，比去年增产26％；花生平均亩产比去年增产60％；蔬菜、干、鲜水果等都比去年增产一倍多；牛、羊和猪只比去年同期增加26％到68％。到9月底统计，全社总收入达到三百七十万元，平均每人一百二十五元，比去年增加13％。
    在今年的大生产运动中，这个社继续发扬了勤俭办社的精神，依靠人民公社的强大力量，战胜了各种自然灾害。在春耕播种时，遇上了旱灾，全体社员在党的总路线的鼓舞下，大鼓干劲，全力投入了抗旱斗争，从多方面开发水源，鏖战二十多天，按时完成了播种任务。夏季又遇到了几十年没有的大雨，社员们采取大协作的办法，立即展开了抗灾救苗运动。公社的各项水利工程也都发挥了防涝作用，大大减轻了灾害，保证了全面大丰收。
    这个公社还制定了全面规划，合理利用了自然资源，从多方面增加收入。公社化以后，他们不但对土地作了调整，实行了因地种植，还建立了五万亩的苹果、梨、干果等培植区，牧畜场发展到四十三处。对于林、副、渔业等生产，都根据生产规划的要求，建立了专业队负责经营，各项生产都搞得很好。
    全面大丰收激发了全体社员的更大干劲，一致表示要继续发扬勤俭办社的光荣传统，并吸取兄弟社的先进经验，夺取明年更大胜利。现在，他们抓住当前的大好时机，已掀起新的生产高潮。在农业上，正加强麦田管理，大搞积肥造肥，争取明年更大丰收。同时，抽出大批劳力搞起三十三种副业生产，决心实现“大干冬三月，每人再增二十元”的要求。（附图片）
