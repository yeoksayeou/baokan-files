    The Great Leap Forward in Records
    ——An Introduction to the Third National Photography Art Exhibition
    Chen Bo
    The Third National Photography Art Exhibition, sponsored by the Chinese Photographic Society, has opened in Beijing. This is a gift from comrades in Chinese photography to the great motherland in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.
    The exhibition features 503 works by 277 authors, including 38 color slides and 58 color photographs. It is a glimpse of China's Great Leap Forward from the end of last year to August of this year. Although the works in the exhibition only reflect a small part of China's actual life, these true historical records are the most powerful counterattack against those hostile elements at home and abroad who attempt to negate the Great Leap Forward.
    Let us look at the works in the exhibition!
    Dong Qing's "Small Blast Furnace Group" is a very valuable work. It shows the mass steelmaking movement of the people in a certain area of Anhui Province through rows of small blast furnaces and people's intense labor. If someone has seen the Second National Photography Art Exhibition (1958), he would naturally think that there was a similar blast furnace group in that exhibition. However, only one year apart, the furnace group has changed, developing from a small "native" furnace group to a furnace group combining "foreign" and "native" methods. This is just a very common example, an epitome of the Great Leap Forward. In fact, such changes have taken place everywhere in the country.
    Of course, this exhibition is by no means limited to reflecting this small-scale indigenous production or the steel production that combines foreign and native methods. It has more works that show the large-scale, modern steel industry that China is building or has already put into production. Better works include Li Jilu's "Leaping Forward Seamless Steel Tube Plant" and Zhang Yunlei's "Pouring Molten Iron." These works not only reflect very important themes, but the authors are also very successful in using indoor natural light to appropriately express the atmosphere of the scene.
    Yu Hui Ru's "Reporting Victory" is a vivid and interesting character sketch. It expresses the infinite confidence and optimistic spirit of the workers in guaranteeing the completion of the national plan, from the side of production, through the moment when several workers are making a phone call.
    The entire exhibition has a considerable weight in showing the achievements of China's socialist industrialization. These works each have their own unique features in terms of lighting and composition, but more noteworthy is that the works reflect the "walking on two legs" policy implemented in China's industrial construction, so these works also have a strong ideological and artistic nature.
    The works of the Third National Photography Art Exhibition are even more rich and colorful in reflecting China's agricultural Great Leap Forward and the superiority of the people's communes. Li Feng's "Cotton Mountain," Hu Wei's "Turning and Drying Wheat," and Zhang Yunqing and Yang Zhenhe's "Wheat Harvest in the Yellow River Flooded Area" and other works show the harvest scenes after the rural people's communes in China. While "Panoramic View of Garden-style Fields" (Qi Guanshan), "In the Busy Farming Season" (Yuan Ling), "Returning from Labor" (Zhao Liqun), "Painting Our Enthusiasm" (Lü Guoqing), "Telephones in Every Township" (Liu Guanghua, Li Zuhui) and other works reflect the new atmosphere of the people's communes and the new life of the peasants from various aspects of the communes. These works fully express that the emergence of the people's communes and the development of the communization movement are not as those hostile elements at home and abroad say, "terrible," on the contrary, it is very good!
    The superiority of the people's communes is not completely expressed in these new scenes and harvest scenes. More obviously, it is in the struggle against difficulties and in the struggle against natural disasters that the incomparable power of the people's communes is truly displayed. Guo Jia's "Unity and Victory over Drought" and Cui Baihua's "Flood Control on a Rainy Night" are such works. These works show people that only by realizing the people's commune and only with a large organizational scale is it possible to overcome disasters and ensure a good harvest.
    In addition to reflecting the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, the works of the Third National Photography Art Exhibition also correctly express the international situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind." "Great Friendship" and "Chairman Mao with Guests from Asia, Africa, and Latin America" (Hou Bo), which are hung in the most prominent position in the exhibition hall, have attracted great attention from the audience. People who visit the exhibition seem to have gained a kind of strength from the works - we have the great ally, the Soviet Union, and the support of people of all races around the world. China's great socialist construction cause will surely achieve greater achievements in a shorter period of time.
    From the Third National Photography Art Exhibition, we can also see that Chinese photographers and photography workers have made progress in delving into life and boldly creating various photographic art works compared to the past. Zhong Zhiren's "Mother, You Are So Confused," Gong Zi's "Haircutting for Tibetan Children," Luo Mingyang's "Listening to Mr. Sun Jingxiu Telling Stories" and other works reflect people's happy life, national unity, and people's new moral qualities and spiritual outlook in various aspects. These landscape, flower, animal, still life and other works exhibited account for a considerable number, which embodies the principle advocated by the Party in literature and art of encouraging the simultaneous existence and mutual competition of works of various different themes, different forms and different styles. It also reflects the unity of the photography circles in China, and every photographer has ample opportunities to develop his own specialties.
    The Third National Photography Art Exhibition can be said to be a vivid and image textbook, and the works reflect the characteristics of our era. It can both encourage people to work harder and give people an aesthetic enjoyment.

    大跃进的纪录
    ——介绍第三届全国摄影艺术展览
    陈勃
    中国摄影学会主办的第三届全国摄影艺术展览已经在北京开幕。这是中国摄影界的同志们，为庆祝建国十周年，向伟大祖国的献礼。
    影展共展出了二百七十七位作者的作品五百零三件，其中包括彩色幻灯片三十八张，彩色照片五十八幅。它是自去年年底以来至今年8月以前，这段期间内，我国大跃进的一个面影。虽然影展的作品，较之我国的实际生活，只不过反映了一鳞半爪，但是这些真实的历史的纪录，对那些企图否定大跃进的国内外的敌对分子，是个最有力的回击。
    我们且看影展中的作品吧！
    董青的“小高炉群”是张很有价值的作品，它通过一排排的小高炉和人们紧张的劳动，表现了安徽省某地人民的大炼钢铁运动。如果有人看过第二届影展（1958年），他会很自然的想到，在那届影展里，也有雷同的一张高炉群，但是，前后仅隔一年，炉群却发生了变化，它从小“土”炉群，发展为“洋土”结合的炉群。这不过是一个很普通的例子，是大跃进事实的一个缩影，实际上在全国各地，到处都发生了这种变化。
    当然，这届影展决不是只反映了这种小型的土法生产或洋土结合的钢铁生产，它有更多的作品还表现了我国正在建设的或已投入生产的大型现代化的钢铁工业。较好的作品如李基禄的“跃进中的无缝钢管厂”、张云磊的“兑铁水”等。这些作品不仅反映的题材是十分重要的，作者在利用室内自然光恰当地表现现场气氛方面也是很成功的。
    喻惠如的“报捷”是一幅生动有趣的人物特写，它从生产的侧面，通过几个工人打电话的一刹那，表现了工人同志们为保证完成国家计划所流露出的那种无限的信心和乐观主义情绪。
    整个影展在表现我国社会主义工业化所取得的各项成就是有相当分量的。这些作品，不论在用光、构图各方面也各有独到之处，但是更值得注意的是，作品反映了我国在工业建设中所执行的“两条腿走路”的方针，因而这些作品也大都具有很强的思想性和艺术性。
    第三届全国影展的作品，在反映我国农业大跃进和人民公社优越性方面，更是丰富多采的。黎枫的“棉山”，胡伟的“翻晒小麦”，张云青、杨震河的“黄泛区小麦丰收”等作品表现了我国农村人民公社化以后的丰收景象。而“园田化的图景”（齐观山）、“在农忙季节里”（袁苓）、“劳动归来”（赵立群）、“画出我们的干劲”（吕国庆）、“乡乡通电话”（刘光华、李祖慧）等，则从公社的各个侧面表现了人民公社的新气象和农民的新生活。这些作品充分表达了人民公社的出现和公社化运动的发展，并不是如那些国内外的敌对分子所说的“糟得很”，恰恰相反，而是好得很！
    人民公社的优越性，还不完全表现在这些新的景象和丰收场面，更为明显的是，它在和困难作斗争中，在和自然灾害作斗争中，才真正显示出人民公社的无比威力。郭佳的“团结一致、战胜干旱”，崔柏华的“雨夜防汛”等，就是这样一些作品。这些作品向人们说明了只有实现人民公社化，只有大的组织规模，战胜灾害、确保丰收才有可能。
    第三届全国影展的作品，除了反映我国社会主义建设的大跃进之外，也正确地表达了“东风压倒西风”的国际形势。悬挂在展览大厅最显著地位的“伟大的友谊”、“毛主席和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的贵宾们在一起”（侯波）等作品，引起观众极大的注意。参观展览会的人，好像从作品那儿得到了一种力量——我们有伟大的盟邦苏联，也有各色人种的全世界人民的支持，我国伟大的社会主义建设事业，一定能在更短的时间内取得更大的成就。
    从第三届全国影展，还可以看到中国的摄影家、摄影工作者在深入生活、大胆创造各种摄影艺术作品，较之过去是有进步的。钟志仁的“妈妈娘，你好糊涂”，恭紫的“给藏族儿童理发”，罗明扬的“听孙敬修先生讲故事”等作品，从各方面反映了人民愉快的生活，民族的团结，以及人们新的道德品质和精神面貌。这些影展展出的风景、花卉、动、静物等类作品，占有相当数量，它体现了党在文学艺术中所提倡的鼓励各种不同题材、不同形式和不同风格的作品同时存在、相互竞赛的原则。它也反映了我国摄影界的团结，每个摄影家都有充分的机会发展自己的特长。
    第三届影展可以说是一部生动的形象教材，作品反映了我们时代的特征。它既可以鼓舞人们更大的干劲，又使人们得到一次美的享受。
