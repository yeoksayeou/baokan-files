　　A Classroom for Popularizing Agricultural Science – Small Farms
　　Li Qi, Chang Jun
　　After the establishment of people's communes, mass agricultural science experiment plots – "small farms" – developed extensively in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province. These "small farms" combined old experiences with new technologies, and used contrasting experiments to address various differing opinions among cadres and the masses on implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." They became classrooms for the people's communes to popularize agricultural science knowledge.

　　Communes Vigorously Develop "Small Farms"

　　"Small Farms" – this flower bloomed in 1954 in the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Xizhanggeng Township. Because the agricultural cooperative's scope was small and conditions were limited, it was not widely promoted throughout the county. After the people's communes were established in 1958, setting up small farms quickly became popular throughout the county. One hundred and twenty-one of the county's one hundred and sixty-one management areas in eleven communes have established "small farms." These farms occupy a total of more than 21,000 mu of cultivated land, accounting for 1.1% of the county's total cultivated land. More than 1,600 people participate, including the elderly, middle-aged, young people, and women. The growth of famous agricultural technicians Qu Yaoli, Wang Yunsheng, and Guo Zhenxi is inseparable from the "small farms." Over the past few years, more than 6,100 agricultural technicians have been trained throughout the county through "small farms"; more than 100 new technologies have been promoted through experimentation; and eleven new wheat varieties and sixteen new cotton varieties have been bred through hybridization. All of these have played a significant role in increasing cotton and wheat production year after year.

　　Everything Through Experimentation

　　Small farms are generally directly subordinate production units of the management area, but they are different from ordinary production teams. They have their own unique style: conducting experiments based on production needs, and immediately promoting successful experiments; conducting experiments based on any disputes among the masses, putting on "rival shows" to resolve the disputes through facts. Currently, there are eighty-seven technical experiment projects under debate in the county; they also undertake the task of cultivating excellent varieties, with the various small farms experimenting with one hundred and twenty-one crop varieties.

　　Production teams that have run "small farms" for many years have a better understanding of the limits and interrelationships of crop dense planting, deep plowing, and fertilization than others. For example, in the situation of the Great Leap Forward last year, the Kaolao Management Area of Kaolao Commune adhered to the principle of "everything through experimentation," and the degree of dense planting of wheat was more reasonable because they understood from practice through years of "small farm" experiments that excessive density is not conducive to ventilation and light transmission. This year, all of the management area's more than 4,800 mu of wheat are dry land, with an increase of 62.14% over last year, becoming the champion of large-scale wheat harvest in dry land throughout the county. The small farm of Wangcun Management Area, Yuxiang Commune, after experimenting with the problem that land flooded in the past could not be cultivated and guarantee full seedlings, finally found the "five soil method" of "turning up raw soil, drying it into yang soil, raking it into fine soil, applying more manure soil, and planting in wet soil" to cultivate it. The application of this method to the fields ensured full wheat seedlings. There are one hundred and sixty-nine technical operations that have been promoted to the fields through experiments in the Xizhanggeng small farm, so the masses enthusiastically call the small farm "the general staff department of the production team." The commune members of Qingtou Commune also wrote a poem for the small farm:

　　Run the small farm ourselves,
　　Experiment when there is a dispute,
　　Look with your own eyes if you can't understand,
　　Wait for the realization if you still don't believe.

　　These clever words aptly reflect the actual situation of the small farm and the role it plays.

　　The Best Classroom and Teaching Material

　　"Small Farms" are also schools for training primary agricultural technicians in rural areas. Influenced and cultivated by agricultural expert Wang Yunsheng in Longju Commune in recent years, the small farm has been used as a classroom, and the crops in the small farm are used as teaching materials, based on the principles of "use what you learn, teach what you use, learn what you do" and "integration of learning and application," a large number of young and middle-aged technical backbones have been trained. According to statistics, 795 people in this commune now understand the habits and prevention methods of major cotton and wheat pests; 589 people have learned the technology of using and simply repairing sprayers and dusters; and 534 people have learned the hybridization technology of wheat, cotton, and corn. Farmer Wang Chao Yi, after studying and operating in the small farm, is now a teacher at the Xizhanggeng Village technical night school. The agricultural middle school in Daqu Management Area, Yuncheng Commune, grew up on the basis of the small farm. This middle school grows 300 mu of land, and students study and work part-time here. Qu Naiqi, who had studied in a senior primary school for one year, was sent to Yuncheng Agricultural College for further study after studying in the agricultural middle school for two years, and is now a veterinarian in the commune.

　　Cadres and Masses Improve Together

　　The county party secretaries of the CCP Yuncheng County also participated in the experimental work of the small farm. They conducted experiments together with the peasants, so that their own practice and the practice of the masses were combined and improved each other, so as to better and more specifically undertake the leadership work. For example, the cotton wide and narrow row planting method this year was promoted throughout the county because the county party secretaries and the peasants successfully experimented together in the small farm last year, so that their own practice was consistent with the practice of the masses. Through holding on-site meetings and organizing teaching, this advanced experience was effectively promoted to the fields. Zhang Laicheng, the party general branch secretary of Baihu Management Area, Yuxiang Commune, and Wang Zhongliu, the director, did not conduct small farm experiments last year, and forced the masses to accept their own subjective arrangements for production, resulting in poor production and becoming a "snail" on the commune's competition list; during the rectification movement, the masses posted more than 500 big-character posters criticizing their work style. They learned their lesson and set up a small farm, and put on "rival shows" with the "Ten Sisters" small farm. The small farm became a meeting hall and an office for guiding production, forming a system in which field production was handled according to small-field experiments. As a result, this year's production in this management area is very good, and it is flying forward in the competition list like a "rocket."

　　Several Experiences and Lessons

　　Yuncheng County has summed up the following experiences in the six years of running "small farms":

　　First, experimenters should be allowed to fail. Failure is inevitable in experimentation. How to deal with failure? This is a very important issue in running a small farm well. The experimenters of the small farm in Wangxi Management Area, Qingtou Commune, experimented with dense planting of wheat last year, sowing 110 to 400 jin per mu, and failed because of excessive density. Some people said, "They don't eat white steamed buns, they kick them with their feet." Some people sarcastically said, "The small farm is doing well, the wheat is growing like cow hair." Some even openly scolded the experimenters of the small farm as "squanderers." Faced with this accusation, the experimenters of this small farm were discouraged and proposed a plan to "retreat" to the commune leaders. However, the commune party committee explained to them the truth that "failure is the mother of success"; the county party committee, after learning about this situation, also talked a lot to the cadres and the masses, telling them not to be afraid of failure. With the support and help of leaders at all levels, the experimenters were greatly encouraged, and the idea of not being arrogant in victory and not being discouraged in defeat was established, which made the small farm more consolidated. Now all the small farms in the county are run very well, and the experimental flowers are all bright and colorful!

　　Second, the purpose and task of the experiment must be clear. The experiment is for promotion, for large-scale high yield, and for the entire agricultural Great Leap Forward; it is not for following the fashion, not for looking good, not for experimenting for the sake of experimenting, it undertakes the task of solving the contradictions of new agricultural technology disputes with facts. In recent years, most of the small farms have adhered to the principle of "all experiments" being based on field promotion, and have taken those effective technical problems that have not been fully accepted by the masses as the center of the experiment, and have achieved good results. For example, the corn wide and narrow row directional sowing method experimented by the Xizhanggeng small farm now has two to three eight-inch to one-foot spikes on each plant, and it is estimated that each mu can harvest 2,000 jin. After visiting, the technicians of the whole commune said that it was a good experience, and planned to promote it in the fields next year. Jin Yuxu, a labor model in Beixiang Management Area, Beixiang Commune, led the small farm to try planting cotton in silt land this year. After the conservative old people knew about it, they said, "Jin Yuxu can walk on tiptoes, planting cotton in silt land, it's shameful." Jin Yuxu did not care about those sarcastic remarks, insisted on experimenting, and increased the number of tillage according to the geological characteristics, so that the soil was always kept loose, and now the cotton is growing very well, and each mu is expected to produce 800 jin of seed cotton. After visiting, the old people said, "Old brains are useless, there are many new things in the new society, we only said that silt land cannot grow cotton in the past, but no one has done any experiments."

　　Third, adhere to the two "three combinations." That is, the "three combination" of cadres, peasants, and technicians; the "three combination" of young people, adults, and old people. This can improve each other, unify experiment and practice, and facilitate promotion in the fields, especially the leaders at all levels and the masses running small farms together play a greater role. When Yongji Commune discussed with the members how to run a small farm, one member said, "It is not very effective for us to run a small farm and conduct experiments alone, because the leaders have not experimented with the things we have successfully experimented with, and sometimes they will not believe it, which is difficult to promote; on the contrary, it is not good to promote it if the leaders do it alone without our participation, because we will not believe what they have successfully experimented with. It is better to do it together."

　　Fourth, combining with agricultural middle schools will make it easier to consolidate small farms. Agricultural middle schools have a more systematic experiment of agricultural technology, have fixed personnel, and the labor problem is easy to solve. The combination of the agricultural middle school and the small farm in Daqu Management Area, Yuncheng Commune, is an example. Here, the school and the farm are combined into one, and it is also a production unit of the management area. The management area stipulates production tasks, provides the required agricultural tools, livestock and other investments, contracts labor and output, rewards for overproduction, and the income belongs to the management area. The students and members work the same and record work points, and participate in profit sharing in the autumn. In this way, some people worried at the beginning that learning and production would be "delayed," but the result was that learning and production were "doubly harvested." (Attached picture)

This is a summary of rice cultivation experience by teachers and students of Shanxi Agricultural College and cadres of the county, commune, and small farm on the ground, preparing to plant double-cropping rice next year.

　　普及农业科学的课堂——小农场
　　李琦　长俊
    人民公社化后，山西运城县群众性的农业科学试验园地——“小农场”。大量地发展起来。这些“小农场”把老经验同新技术结合起来，把干部和群众中对贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的各种不同意见，都拿来进行对比试验。它成了人民公社普及农业科学知识的课堂。
    公社大办“小农场”
    “小农场”——这朵鲜花是从1954年在西张耿乡星火农业社开放起来的。由于农业社的范围小，各方面条件有限，所以一直没有在全县大量地推广开来。1958年人民公社化以后，办小农场在全县很快形成了风气。全县十一个公社一百六十一个管理区，已经有一百二十一个管理区办起了“小农场”。这些农场总共占耕地二万一千多亩，占全县总耕地1.1％。参加的人有一千六百多人，其中有老年、中年、青年和妇女。著名的农业技术能手曲耀离、王运升、郭振西的成长都是和“小农场”分不开的。几年来，通过“小农场”，在全县培养出农业技术人员有六千一百多人；经过试验，推广了新技术一百多条；经过杂交培育了十一个小麦新品种、十六个棉花新品种。所有这些，对棉麦连年增产起了显著的作用。
    一切通过试验
    小农场一般的都是管理区的直属生产单位，但它又不同于普通的生产队。它有自己的独特风格：根据生产需要进行试验，试验成功就立即推广；群众有什么争论就作什么试验，唱“对台戏”，让争论在事实面前落实定案。目前全县争论的技术试验项目就有八十七个；它还担负着培养优良品种的任务，各个小农场试验的作物品种就有一百二十一种。
    办了许多年“小农场”的生产队，对作物密植、深耕、施肥等的极限和互相关系就比别人心里更有底细。比如，在去年大跃进的形势下，考老公社考老管理区坚持了“一切经过试验”的原则，在小麦的密植程度上就比较合理，这是因为他们通过“小农场”的历年试验，从实践中懂得了过密不利于通风透光的道理。今年这个管理区四千八百多亩小麦全是旱地，比去年增产62.14％，成为全县旱地小麦大面积丰收的冠军。于乡公社王村管理区小农场，对于过去认为被洪水漫过的地无法耕作和保证全苗的问题，经过试验，终于找到了“翻起生土、晒成阳土、耙成细土、多上粪土、种在湿土”的“五土法”来耕作，这种办法运用到大田，保证了小麦全苗。通过试验推广到大田去的技术操作，在西张耿小农场就有一百六十九条，因此群众热情地把小农场叫做“生产队的参谋部”。卿头公社社员们还为小农场写了一首诗：
    小农场自己办，
    有争论就试验，
    想不通亲眼看，
    再不信等兑现。
    这些巧言妙语恰如其分的反映了小农场的实际情况和它所起的作用。
    最好的课堂和教材
    “小农场”还是培养农村初级农业技术人材的学校。龙居公社几年来受农业土专家王运升的影响和培养，把小农场当课堂，小农场的庄稼为教材，本着“用什么、教什么，学什么、做什么”和“学用一致”的原则，培养了大批青壮年技术骨干。据统计，这个公社现在有七百九十五人懂得了棉麦主要虫害的习性和防治的方法；有五百八十九人学会使用和简单修理喷雾器和喷粉器的技术；有五百三十四人学会了小麦、棉花、玉茭的杂交技术；农民王超义经过在小农场的学习操作，现在成为西张耿村技术夜校的教员。运城公社大渠管理区的农业中学，就是在小农场的基础上成长起来的。这所中学种着三百亩地，学生在这里半耕半读。高小读过一年的曲乃琦，在农业中学学习了两年后，又被公社保送到运城农业专科学校深造，现在成为公社的兽医。
    干部和群众共同提高
    中共运城县县委书记也大都参加了小农场的试验工作。他们和农民共同搞试验，使自己的实践和群众的实践互相结合，互相提高，以便更好更具体地担负起领导工作。比如，今年的棉花宽窄行播种法，所以能够在全县推广，就是县委书记们去年在小农场和农民共同试验成功后，使自己的实践和群众的实践相一致了，通过开现场会，组织传授，才有效地把这项先进经验推广到大田。于乡公社百户管理区党总支书记张来成、主任王中流，去年没有搞小农场试验，就强迫群众接受自己凭主观布置的一套办法搞生产，结果生产没搞好，在全公社竞赛榜上成了“蜗牛”；在整风中，群众贴了五百多张大字报，批评他们的作风。他们接受了教训，办起了小农场，并且和“十姊妹”小农场唱“对台戏”，小农场变成了会堂，变成了指导生产的办公室，形成了大田生产按小田试验办事的制度，这样一来，今年这个管理区的生产搞得很好，在竞赛榜上坐着“火箭”飞跃前进。
    几点经验和教训
    运城县在办“小农场”的六年过程中，摸索到以下几条经验：
    第一，要允许试验者失败。作试验是难免失败的。怎样对待失败？这对办好小农场是一个很关重要的问题。卿头公社王西管理区小农场的试验者们，去年试验的密植小麦，每亩下种一百一十斤到四百斤，结果因为过密失败了。一部分人就说：“白馍馍不吃，用脚踢哩。”有的人讽刺地说：“小农场搞得好，麦子长得像牛毛。”甚至有人公开骂小农场的试验者是“败家子”。面对这种责难，这个小农场的试验者们灰心丧气了，向公社领导上提出了“打退堂鼓”的计划。可是公社党委向他们说明了“失败是成功之母”的道理；县委了解到这种情况后，也在干部和群众中大讲特讲，不要怕失败。在各级领导的支持和帮助下，大大鼓舞了试验者，树立了胜不骄、败不馁的思想，这样就使小农场更加巩固了。现在全县所有的小农场，都办得很有声色，试验花朵，朵朵鲜艳！
    第二，试验的目的和任务必须明确。试验是为了推广，是为了大面积丰产，是为了整个农业大跃进；不是为了赶时髦，不是为了好看，不是为了试验而试验，它担负着用事实解决对新的农业技术争论的矛盾。几年来，多数的小农场坚持了“一切试验”落脚于大田推广的原则，把那些行之有效、但在群众中还未被完全接受的技术问题作为试验的中心，获得了良好的效果。如西张耿小农场，试验的玉茭宽窄行定向播种法，现在每棵上有两个到三个八寸到一尺的穗子，估计每亩可收两千斤。全公社的技术员们参观后，都说是好经验，计划在下年大田推广。北相公社北相管理区劳动模范金玉绪领导的小农场，今年在淤土地试种了棉花，有保守思想的老年人知道后说：“金玉绪能够用脚尖走路哩，淤地种棉花，丢人没深浅”。金玉绪没有管那些热讽冷刺，坚持试验，根据地质特性加多中耕的次数，以便土壤经常保持松软，现在棉花生长非常好，每亩预计可产籽棉八百斤。老年人参观后都说：“老脑筋不中用了，新社会新事情就是多，咱们过去只说淤地不能种棉花，可谁也不作试验。”
    第三，坚持两个“三结合”。就是干部、农民、技术人员“三结合”；青年人、壮年人、老年人“三结合”。这样能够互相提高，使试验和实践相统一，便于在大田中推广，尤其是各级领导干部和群众一道办小农场作用更大。永济公社和社员座谈如何办小农场问题时，有一个社员说：“光我们办小农场、搞试验作用不大，因为我们试验成功的东西领导没有经过试验，有时会不相信，这就难以推广；相反，没有我们参加，光领导干部搞也不行，因为他们试验成功的我们也会不相信，同样是不好推广。要搞还是一块搞。”
    第四，和农业中学结合起来，会更便于小农场的巩固。农业中学对于农业技术的试验比较系统，又有固定的人员，劳力问题好解决。运城公社大渠管理区的农业中学和小农场的结合就是一例。这里是校场合一，它也是管理区的一个生产单位，管理区给规定生产任务，供给所需的农具、牲畜和其他投资，包工包产，超产奖励，收入归管理区，学生们和社员们劳动一样记工分，秋后参加分红。这样办开始有人担心学习、生产“两耽误”，结果却是学习生产“双丰收”。（附图片）
