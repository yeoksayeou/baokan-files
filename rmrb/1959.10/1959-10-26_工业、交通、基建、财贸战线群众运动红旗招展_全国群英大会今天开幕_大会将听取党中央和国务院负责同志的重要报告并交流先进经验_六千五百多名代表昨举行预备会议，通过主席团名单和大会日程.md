Xinhua News Agency, 25th -- The grand National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, basic construction, and finance and trade will officially open in Beijing tomorrow. This afternoon, more than 6,500 representatives who attended the meeting held a preparatory meeting in the Great Hall of the People.

The preparatory meeting was presided over by Liu Ningyi, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Congress. Amidst the prolonged applause of more than 6,000 people in the audience, he warmly praised this congress as a grand gathering of heroes coming to Beijing to present treasures and learn from experience. He called on all representatives to hold this meeting well and to raise the banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward even higher.

Li Jiebo, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Congress, introduced the preparations for the Congress. Li Jiebo said that after the Party Central Committee and the State Council announced the decision to hold this congress in March this year, workers across the country felt that "one person going to Beijing brings glory to everyone," and welcomed the opening of the congress with joy and encouragement. During this period, the national workers were encouraged to work harder and harder in production, to strive for the upstream again and again, and the production upsurge was higher and higher. This has played a great role in implementing the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and ensuring the pre-schedule and overfulfillment of the 1959 production tasks.

Amidst the warm applause that swept the audience, all the representatives unanimously passed the list of the Presidium and the list of the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-Generals. The Presidium is composed of 282 people. These include responsible persons of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and relevant departments, mass organizations, heads of various delegations, as well as well-known advanced producers from various regions and industrial systems.

The preparatory meeting also approved the congress agenda. The congress is scheduled to last for eleven days. All representatives will listen to important reports from responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee and the State Council at this congress. Many representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers will speak at the meeting. In order to spread the exemplary deeds and advanced experiences of the heroes more widely and deeply, the meeting will adopt a combination of large meetings, medium meetings, and small meetings, and exchange experiences in more than 30 industrial systems separately.
