Gallop, Our Motherland's Automobiles
By Our Correspondent Chen Zilin

On the vast land of our motherland, before liberation, there were approximately 70,000 automobiles, but not a single one was produced domestically. "The roads of the motherland are calling for its own automobiles!" This was the cry of the time.

However, in the brief years after liberation, with the help of the great Soviet Union, we filled the void of not being able to manufacture our own automobiles with a world-class, modern automobile manufacturing industry. Now, it is not just one kind of domestic automobile that echoes across our land. The roar of trucks, dump trucks, tractors, and sedans has merged into a magnificent chorus.

We Have Learned to Manufacture Automobiles

In the First Automobile Works, the sounds of labor surge like a tide every day. Tens of thousands of automobile workers are working tensely and joyfully on production lines, everything is so rapid, accurate, and orderly. Their skilled operating techniques enable more than three thousand kinds of automobile parts to flow evenly along the conveyor belt, which is dozens of kilometers long, to the final assembly line, according to the unified rhythm of the entire factory. Here, automobiles pass by like an endless river.

Today, the time it takes for a car to come off the final assembly line is no longer the twenty-odd minutes it took at the beginning, nor the nine-plus minutes stipulated in the design, but four minutes. At the beginning, because the workers were not proficient in organizing automobile production, either this workshop lacked raw materials or that workshop's material supply was not timely, and the production control room received frantic calls every day. Now, not only has the phenomenon of production stoppage caused by disconnections in parts supply disappeared, but also the cost of automobiles has been reduced by half compared to the first year of production (1956), and the warranty mileage of automobiles has been increased from 25,000 kilometers to 50,000 kilometers. The workers have not only successfully mastered the manufacturing technology of the Liberation brand automobile, but also collectively designed and manufactured more advanced heavy-duty trucks. These facts tell people: we have mastered the new technology of manufacturing automobiles.

The First Automobile Works is a complex factory with a high level of technology and organization. It is conceivable how enormous the technical difficulties were for those college and middle school students, rural youths, workers from old factories, and local cadres who had never seen a modern automobile factory before, at the beginning of operations in such a highly modern factory.

But difficulties did not stop the workers' determination to master automobile production technology. The Party gave them courage, Soviet experts gave them enthusiastic help, and they themselves were exceptionally persevering.

Let's first talk about how our workers learned to use the spiral bevel gear machine tools equipped for us by the Soviet Union! This is special equipment for the precision machining of automobile bevel gears; without it, automobiles cannot be made. At first, people said that it had a complex structure and was "famously" difficult to master. It has more than twenty adjustment positions, and a slight movement will change everything. In order to master the equipment adjustment technology, the Party organization designated an engineer at the time to help Cao Changyou, a young technician. This young Communist Party member, who came from a student background, was very strong. Under the guidance of engineer Zhang Xuemeng, he buried his head and experimented with waste gears little by little. After more than three years, he finally learned to master the adjustment technology of the spiral bevel gear machine skillfully. Now, more than twenty other young workers are operating these pieces of equipment, and Cao Changyou only comes to help when the equipment malfunctions.

Automobile assembly line production requires every worker on the production line to maintain a consistent pace. When Dong Guiqing, a female grinder, first came to the automobile factory, she worked very slowly because the grinder had high precision and was difficult to operate. The parts flowing down from the previous process piled up next to her, waiting for her to process them. She was impatient and secretly cried next to the machine tool when she saw that she was lagging behind others. For more than a week in a row, she suffered from insomnia, thinking about how to catch up with others. Later, after being enlightened by her master, she made a pointer to control the size of the parts, shortened the auxiliary time, and became the first advanced worker in the factory to break the design labor quota for the grinder. The four thousand-plus young technicians who joined the factory at the same time as Dong Guiqing were all middle and primary school students. After three years of study and training, they can now not only skillfully execute the entire operation process of automobile production according to the unified rhythm of the entire factory, but also have learned the adjustment technology of more than ten new types of machine tools. After Wang Ruixing, a twenty-two-year-old third-grade borer, improved the boring machine process last year and increased production efficiency by two times, he also wrote a book based on his own practice, entitled "Golden Steel Knife Boring Machine Boring Processing," which has been published by the "Mechanical Industry Publishing House."

In the forging workshop, you can see the master workers such as Bao Fusi, Wang Zhibao, Wang Hanqing, and Xuan Deliang operating the air hammer. A steel billet weighing more than one hundred kilograms is hammered into a crankshaft and front beam in a few sounds. From their labor, it is difficult to see any superfluous movements or improprieties. A few years ago, they were all blacksmiths who used manual labor in blacksmith shops, and they never knew that there were such new-style die forging hammers in the world. Before the automobile factory started operations, they went to the Soviet Union for internships with more than 500 other employees from the factory. There, old expert Alexander, who had more than forty years of forging experience, passed on all his experience to them. The old expert also came to China to participate in production adjustments with them. They recorded the expert's experience in dealing with every specific problem in notebooks and repeatedly thought about them, so each of them learned the forging technology of more than one hundred types of automobile parts.

The leading cadres at all levels who were transferred from local areas initially studied technology and culture in the factory leading cadres training class. If they were outsiders to factory management in the past, today they have become true enterprise leading cadres with considerable technical knowledge and management skills. Deputy Director Ma Chengzhai had been working in rural areas during the war. When he first came to the automobile factory to lead the material supply work, he could not find out that the material supply department had omissions in material preparation and duplicated orders because he did not understand the business. Four years ago, he and more than 150 other old cadres in the factory entered the classroom at the same time and diligently studied courses such as automobile structure and metal materials. He studied every morning, every evening, and even on the train when he was on business trips. He finally understood the properties and uses of various steels required for manufacturing automobiles, and he no longer suffered from the past distress of not understanding technology in his work.

Climbing the Peak of the Automobile Industry

When our country's young automobile manufacturers grew up to be able to spread their wings and fly high, miracles appeared one after another. This is not only because they doubled their production capacity in less than two years after learning to produce automobiles, nor is it only because they are advancing towards the grand goal of "annual output of 150,000, turning one factory into five factories." What is even more shocking is that they trial-produced more than ten new types of automobiles in one year last year and jumped from producing heavy-duty trucks to manufacturing high-end sedans all at once. This kind of technological leap is a speed that no capitalist country has dared to imagine since the German Benz invented the automobile in 1885. In capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, it generally takes three to four years for a new model to go from design, trial production to finalization and put into production, while our "Red Flag" high-end sedan took only one year.

We have only three years of automobile manufacturing history, and in the past, we not only had not manufactured high-end sedans, but even the design data for small sedans were not sufficient. It was under these conditions that the employees of the First Automobile Works began the manufacturing of high-end sedans in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, adopting the method of "trial production and improvement at the same time."

The first "Red Flag" prototype vehicle trial-produced was not good because the employees underestimated the arduousness of ensuring the quality of the sedan. Some parts were not accurate enough, and after the car was assembled and ran only a few thousand kilometers, the engine became too hot to work, the brakes failed, and the steering could not automatically return…

Difficulties blocked the workers' path like mountains. But they said, "Our character is the character that makes the mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way! Since others can do it, then we must do it!" The factory's Party leadership strongly led this battle to seize the cutting edge of automobile industry technology, and concentrated more than 1,000 outstanding technical cadres, thousands of skilled technicians, and the majority of leadership to form more than 30 factory-wide "three-way combination" shock teams. Then, a mass movement of "Ten thousand horses galloping towards the 'Red Flag,' conquering the quality barrier" was launched throughout the factory. From the automobile factory to its hundreds of cooperative factories and satellite factories, they united under the heroic slogan of "Fighting for the Red Flag, winning glory for the motherland" and worked together to solve technical difficulties.

Hydraulic tappets, these are the main parts of the engine that control the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves. If it breaks down, the engine will stop working like a person's respiratory system being blocked. Making it work for a long time without wear is a very complex technical problem. In order to solve this problem, more than 100 old technicians and engineers and workshop directors worked together to research and explore, melted more than 30 furnaces of molten iron successively, did 42 sets of quenching experiments, and also overturned more than 70 kinds of written trial production plans, and finally selected the best materials, processed them precisely, and reached the design requirements.

The engine is the heart of the car, and casting the cylinder block is very important. More than 60 old foundry workers with more than ten years of experience cast 180 times in a row based on the general experience of casting cylinder blocks, but they did not succeed. They either had pinholes and blowholes, or the dimensions were inaccurate. They are like eagles in a storm, unyielding and continue to experiment tirelessly. They said: "If one thousand times does not work, we must try it!" After four or five months of painstaking deliberation, they found a way to reduce pinholes and stabilize dimensions, and finally cast a qualified cylinder block on the 181st time.

You may think that the door lock on the car is a very ordinary and inconspicuous part! Even such a product must undergo tens of thousands of strict opening and closing tests in the automobile laboratory before it can be installed on the car. Because once the door lock fails when the car is driving at high speed and the door opens, people may be thrown out. To ensure that the car door opens quickly and closes tightly, each part in the door lock must reach the proper precision. It was for this reason that it took the employees of the Shanghai Liyong Lock Factory half a year to successfully manufacture it. This is just one example of the many technical key issues that the cooperative factories have solved.

The First Automobile Works' manufacturing of high-end sedans received the enthusiastic care of the employees of the Soviet automobile manufacturing industry. The Soviet Likhachev, Gorky, and other automobile factories not only transported the latest technical data and samples for us, but also sent four experts in sedans to personally guide our production.

It was in this way that the employees of the First Automobile Works, under the leadership of the Party, with their soaring drive and wisdom, and with the help of Soviet experts, solved more than 1,000 technical problems in a short period of several months, enabling the "Red Flag" high-end sedan to be put into mass production.

The mass production of the "Red Flag" high-end sedan marks that our country can not only produce trucks and manufacture ordinary sedans, but we can also design and manufacture the most advanced automobile structure in the world.

Gallop! Our Motherland's Automobiles.

    奔驰吧祖国的汽车
    本报记者　陈子林
    在我们祖国辽阔的土地上，解放前行驶的汽车大约有七万辆，可是从没有一辆是自己生产的。“祖国的道路在呼唤着自己的汽车！”这就是当时的呼声。
    然而，在解放后的短暂的几年里，我们就在伟大的苏联帮助下，以世界上头等现代化的汽车制造业，填补了我国不能自制汽车的空白。现在我国土地上响起的不只一种国产汽车的音调。载重车、翻斗车、牵引车、小轿车的轰鸣声，汇成了雄浑的合唱。
    我们学会了制造汽车
    在第一汽车制造厂里，每天都沸腾着潮水般的劳动声响。数以万计的汽车工人，他们在一条条生产线上，紧张而又欢腾地工作着，一切都是那样的迅速、准确、有规律。他们那种熟练的操作技术，使三千多种汽车零件，都能按全厂统一的节奏，沿着长达几十公里的输送带，均衡地流到总装配线。在这里，汽车就像流不尽的长河，滔滔而过。
    今天的总装配线，每出一辆汽车已经不是开工初期的二十几分钟，也不是设计规定的九分多钟，而是四分钟。当初，因为职工们组织汽车生产不熟练，不是这个车间缺少毛胚，就是那个车间材料供应不及时，生产总调度室，每天都是四面告急的电话声。如今不但由于零件供应脱节等原因而造成的流水停歇的现象，已经没有了。就是汽车的成本，也比开工生产第一年（1956年）降低了一半，汽车的保用里程，已由两万五千公里，提高到五万公里。职工们不仅成功地掌握了解放牌汽车的制造技术，还集体设计和制造出了结构更先进的载重卡车。这些事实告诉人们：我们已经掌握了制造汽车的新技术。
    第一汽车厂是一个复杂的、有高度技术和组织水平的工厂。可以想见，在这样一个高度现代化的工厂里，那些从来没有见过现代化汽车厂的大中学生、农村青年、老工厂的工人和地方干部，在开工之初遇到的技术困难，该是多么巨大。
    但是，困难没有挡住职工掌握汽车生产技术的决心。党给了他们勇气，苏联专家给了他们热情的帮助，他们自己更是毅力非凡。
    先说我们的工人怎样学会使用苏联为我们装备的螺旋伞齿轮机床吧！这是汽车伞齿轮精加工的特殊设备，没有它，就做不了汽车。初学时，人们都说它构造复杂，“著名”的难掌握。它有二十多个调整部位，你动它一点，全盘都会发生变化。为了掌握设备调整技术，党组织当时指定了一个工程师，专门帮助青年技工曹长有。这个学生出身的青年共产党员，很刚强。他在工程师张学孟指导下，闷着头，一点点地用废齿轮试验，经过三年多时间，终于学会了熟练地掌握螺旋伞齿机的调整技术。现在摆弄这些设备的已是另外二十几个青工，只有设备出了毛病，曹长有才来帮一下忙。
    汽车的流水生产，要求生产线上的每个工人，经常保持均衡的速度。女磨工董桂清，初来汽车厂时，因为磨床精度高，难操作，工作得很慢，上道工序流下的零件，堆在她旁边，等她加工。她性子急，看自己落在别人后面，就站在机床旁偷偷哭。接连一个多星期，她失眠，思考自己怎么赶别人。后来经过师傅启发，她做出了一种控制零件尺寸的指针，缩短了辅助时间，使自己成为全厂第一个冲破磨床设计工时定额的先进工人。和董桂清同时入厂的四千多个青年技工，都是中小学生，经过三年的学习和锻炼，现在他们不仅能按全厂统一节奏，熟练地执行着汽车生产的全部操作过程，而且每人都学会了十多种新式机床的调整技术。二十二岁的三级镗工王瑞星，在去年改进镗床工艺，把生产效率提高了两倍以后，还以自己的实践，写成了“金钢刀镗床镗孔加工”一书，已由“机械工业出版社”出版。
    在锻工车间，你可以看到鲍福四、王治宝、王汉清、宣德良等老师傅，开动大气锤的情景。一百多公斤的钢胚，在他们手里嘣咚几声，就打成了曲轴和前梁。从他们的劳动中，你很难看出有什么多余的动作和不当之处。几年前他们都是铁匠铺里用手工劳动的铁匠，从来不知道世界上还有这样新式的模锻锤。汽车厂开工以前，他们曾和全厂五百多名职工一起到苏联实习。在那里有四十多年锻造经验的老专家亚历山大洛夫，把自己的全部经验，都传授给了他们，老专家还来中国和他们一起参加生产调整。他们把专家处理每一个具体问题的经验，都记在小本子上，反复思考，因此每人都学会了一百多种汽车零件的锻造技术。
    从地方转业来的各级领导干部，一开始就在工厂领导干部进修班学习技术和文化。如果说他们过去是管理工厂的门外汉，今天却已经变成了真正的具有相当技术知识和管理水平的企业领导干部了。副厂长马诚斋，在战争时期，一直是在农村工作。刚来汽车厂领导材料供应工作时，因为不懂业务，材料供应部门，备料漏项、重复订货，他也发现不了。四年前，他和全厂一百五十多名老干部，同时走进了教室，勤奋地学习着汽车构造、金属材料等课程。他每天早晨学，晚间学，出差在火车上也在学。他终于懂得制造汽车所需的各种钢材的性能和用途，在工作中，不再发生过去那种不懂技术的苦恼了。
    攀登汽车工业的顶峰
    当我国年轻的汽车制造者成长到能展翅高飞时，奇迹就接二连三的出现了。这不仅是因为他们在学会生产汽车不到两年，就把生产能力翻了一番；也不仅是因为他们正在向着“年产十五万，一厂变五厂”的宏伟目标猛进。更令人震惊的是：他们在去年一年中，就试制出十多种新型汽车，并且由生产载重卡车一下子跨上了制造高级轿车。这种技术上的飞跃，是1885年德国本赤发明汽车以来，任何资本主义国家都不曾敢于设想过的速度。在美、英、法等资本主义国家，一种新车型，从设计、试制到定型投入生产，一般都要三年到四年时间，而我们的“红旗”高级轿车，却不过用了一年。
    我们制造汽车的历史只有三年，过去不但没有制造过高级轿车，就连小轿车的设计资料也不充分。第一汽车制造厂职工就是在这样条件下，在1958年大跃进中，采取“边试制，边改进”的办法，开始了高级轿车的制造工作。
    最先试制的一辆“红旗”样车，因为职工对保证轿车质量的艰巨性，估计不足，有些零件精度不够，汽车装配起来只跑了几千公里，发动机就烫得不能工作了，刹车失灵，转向已经不能自动回转……
    困难就像高山一样挡住了职工们的去路。但是他们说：“我们的性格，是让高山低头，河水让路的性格！”既然有人能做到，那我们就一定要做到！”工厂党的领导，有力地领导了这场攻占汽车工业技术尖端的战斗，把全厂一千多名优秀的技术干部，几千个熟练的技术工人，和绝大部分领导力量，都集中起来，分别组成了三十多个全厂性的“三结合”突击队。接着一个“万马奔‘红旗’，攻下质量关”的群众运动，就在全厂展开了。从汽车厂到它的上百个协作厂和卫星厂，都在“为红旗而战，为祖国争光”的豪壮的口号下，团结起来，共同解决技术难关。
    液压挺杆，这是发动机控制进排气门开关的主要零件，它一坏，发动机就会像人封闭了呼吸系统那样，就会停止工作了。要使它长期工作，不受磨损，是一个非常复杂的技术问题。为了解决这一问题，一百多名老技工和工程师、车间主任一起，共同研究、摸索，先后熔化过三十多炉铁水，做过四十二组淬火试验，也推翻过七十多种成文的试制方案，终于选用了最好的材料，经过精密加工，达到了设计要求。
    发动机是汽车的心脏，浇铸气缸体是很重要的。六十多名十年以上的老铸工，根据一般气缸体浇铸经验，一连浇铸一百八十次，没有成功，不是有砂眼气孔，就是尺寸不准。他们像风暴中的雄鹰，毅然不屈，继续循环不休的试验。他们说：“一千次不成，也要试下去！”他们经过四、五个月的苦心琢磨，找到了减少砂眼和稳定尺寸的办法，在第一百八十一次，到底铸出了质量合格的气缸体。
    轿车上的门锁，也许你会认为是种很普通，很不显眼的零件吧！就是这样一件产品，也要在汽车试验室里，经过几万次严格的开关试验之后，才可以装上车。因为在汽车高速行驶时，一旦门锁失灵，车门打开，人就可能被摔出去。要保证车门开得快，关得牢，就要使门锁内每个零件，达到应有的精度。也就是因为这个缘故，它使上海利用锁厂职工，动了半年的脑筋才制成功。这仅是协作厂解决许多技术关键中的一个例子。
    第一汽车厂制造高级轿车，得到了苏联汽车制造业职工的热情关怀。苏联李哈乔夫、高尔基等汽车厂，不仅为我们运来了最新的技术资料和样品，他们还派了四名轿车方面的专家，亲自来指导我们进行生产。
    第一汽车制造厂职工，就是这样在党的领导下，以自己冲天的干劲和智慧，在苏联专家的帮助下，在短短的几个月里，解决了一千多个技术关，使“红旗”高级轿车开始成批投入生产。
    “红旗”高级轿车的成批生产，标志我国不仅能生产卡车，制造一般轿车，就是世界上最先进的汽车结构，我们也能设计和制造了。
    奔驰吧！祖国的汽车。
