Editor's Note:

    Reaching Out is Not as Good as Doing It Yourself
    It's only been a year since the communization, and Shandong province is demanding that everyone achieve one mu of irrigated land, while Guangxi wants to build a loofah-like irrigation network throughout the region... The large-scale winter water conservancy projects in various provinces are unfolding with overwhelming momentum, which is a signal of a bumper harvest next year!
    The water conservancy projects undertaken in various regions are numerous and large in scale, which also increases the need for materials and equipment. What to do? Yushan County, Jiangxi, vigorously established small factories at construction sites, producing large quantities of tools, explosives, cement, and daily necessities needed by the laborers, basically achieving self-sufficiency in construction materials. The dependent mentality of so-called "large projects, few equipment, and only waiting for state supply to complete the tasks" has been criticized in the face of the facts.
    Difficulties exist everywhere and at all times. In the work of manufacturing water conservancy tools and equipment, there will also be this or that kind of difficulty. The key question is whether to be afraid of difficulties and stop moving forward, or to rely on the masses to overcome difficulties? Difficulties always bow to those who are high-spirited and full of fighting spirit. Yushan County has become a model of diligence and thrift in water conservancy construction, first of all because they are not afraid of difficulties, are self-reliant, and do not become "reaching-out parties"!

    伸手不如动手
    公社化仅仅一年的时间，山东全省要求每人实现一亩水浇田，广西要在全区建成长藤结瓜水利网……，各省大规模的冬修水利工程正以排山倒海之势全面展开，这是明年大丰收的信号！
    各地兴办的水利工程多、规模大，所需物资器材也就增加了。怎么办？江西玉山县大办工地小型工厂，制造出大批工具、炸药、水泥以及民工所需日用品，基本上做到了施工物资自给。那些所谓“工程大，器材少，要完成任务就只有等待国家供应”的依赖思想在事实面前受到了批判。
    困难处处有，时时有。在制造水利工具器材的工作上，也会有这样或那样的困难。问题的关键是畏难不前，还是依靠群众去克服困难？而困难总是向意气风发、斗志昂扬的人们低头。玉山县成为勤俭修水利的榜样，首先就在于他们不畏困难、自力更生，不当“伸手派”！
