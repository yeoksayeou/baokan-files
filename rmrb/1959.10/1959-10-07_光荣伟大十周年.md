Singing the Motherland

    The East is red, the sun rises,
    Chairman Mao comes to Tiananmen.
    Tiananmen, shining brightly,
    A vast ocean of boiling enthusiasm.
    Ten thousand trees of flags flutter in the square,
    A red forest surging with waves.
    The image of a century of heroes is present,
    The commemorative monument is taller than the sky.
    Six hundred and fifty million hearts,
    Fly to Tiananmen together,
    Gather around Chairman Mao together,
    Millions cheer and celebrate National Day.
    The clear sky stretches for ten thousand miles, the dark clouds disperse.
    The red sun shines brightly in the center.
    Please recognize the true face of Lushan—
    Adhere to the glorious General Line.
    More, faster, better, and more economical, boost morale.
    Leap forward, leap forward again.
    Vow to sweep away poverty and ignorance,
    Hundreds of millions of men and women are of one mind.
    The People's Commune is like the morning sun.
    Five hundred million peasants are overjoyed.
    The scenery is infinitely good for thousands of miles:
    The countryside gets a new look every day.
    Subduing dragons and tigers, destroying drought demons.
    Thousands of troops and horses capture the Dragon King.
    From now on, we don't rely on heaven for food,
    The people themselves are the Jade Emperor.
    Steel cities everywhere are ablaze with fire dragons,
    Determined to catch up with old John.
    John rides an ox, I ride a horse,
    Why would it take more than ten years to catch him?
    Steel, coal, grain, and cotton, the four brothers,
    March forward shoulder to shoulder.
    Moving mountains and overturning seas is commonplace.
    The spirit of reforming the earth and reversing the sky is heroic.
    The second round of the Five-Year Plan,
    We will complete it in two years.
    Those who change the ordinary calendar—
    Chinese people of the Mao Zedong era!
    The East is red, the sun rises,
    Chairman Mao comes to Tiananmen.
    He waves frequently to the people,
    The square is a vast ocean of boiling enthusiasm!

    光荣伟大十周年
    萧三
    东方红，太阳升，
    毛主席来到天安门。
    天安门，放光芒，
    一片汪洋大沸腾。
    广场万树旌旗飘，
    一片红林生波涛。
    百年英雄形象在，
    纪念丰碑比天高。
    六亿五千万颗心，
    一齐飞上天安门，
    一齐围绕毛主席，
    万众欢呼祝国庆。
    晴空万里乌云散。
    红日当中光灿烂。
    请识庐山真面目——
    坚持光辉总路线。
    多快好省鼓干劲。
    跃进跃进再跃进。
    誓扫一穷和二白，
    亿万男女一条心。
    人民公社似朝阳。
    五亿农民喜洋洋。
    千里风光无限好：
    乡村日日换新装。
    降龙伏虎歼旱魃。
    千军万马擒龙王。
    从今不靠天吃饭，
    人民自己当玉皇。
    钢城处处火龙翻，
    决心赶过老约翰。
    约翰骑牛我骑马，
    赶他何用十多年？
    钢煤粮棉四弟兄，
    并肩携手打冲锋。
    移山倒海寻常事。
    复地翻天气概雄。
    五年计划第二轮，
    我们两年就完成。
    改变普通日历者
    ——毛泽东时代的中国人！
    东方红，太阳升，
    毛主席来到天安门。
    他向人民频挥手，
    广场一片汪洋大沸腾！
