Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Bari Diwando, the Guinean Republic's government representative and Minister of Education of Guinea, told Xinhua reporters today that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Guinea will enhance cooperation in various aspects between the people of Asia and Africa who have been liberated from colonial oppression.

Diwando represented the Guinean government in discussions with the Chinese government on the development of relations between the two countries. Subsequently, the two countries issued a joint communiqué on October 4th establishing diplomatic relations.

In an interview with Xinhua reporters, he pointed out that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Guinea and the signing of a cultural cooperation agreement will undoubtedly have a huge impact on the entire African continent. The path of genuine cooperation between the people of Guinea and the people of China has been opened. This relationship is established within the scope of the Bandung Conference resolutions, and we celebrate this relationship. Diwando expressed his admiration for the military parade and people's march celebrating the tenth anniversary of China's founding. He mentioned that he had visited industrial and agricultural exhibitions, textile factories, and people's communes in Beijing. He said that he had seen the great efforts made by the Chinese people to build their own country, the continuous improvement of the living standards of Chinese workers and farmers, and China has become one of the most powerful countries in the world. Speaking of the prospects for the African national independence movement, the representative from a country that gained independence a year ago said that European powers have divided their spheres of influence in Africa, and now the African people are fighting to get rid of colonial oppression, and they are getting help from many friendly countries in their struggle. However, the colonialists are short-sighted and still believe in the principles of Gaulle (French colonialist), Malan (South African colonialist), and Salazar (Portuguese colonialist). He emphasized that African countries will achieve independence one after another, and after independence, they will realize African unity.

    几内亚政府代表对新华社记者发表谈话
    中几两国建交将增进亚非国家友好合作
    新华社7日讯　几内亚共和国政府代表、几内亚教育部长巴里·迪亚万杜今天对新华社记者说，中国和几内亚建立外交关系，将增进从殖民压迫下获得解放的亚非人民之间各方面的合作关系。
    迪亚万杜曾代表几内亚政府同中国政府就发展两国关系问题举行座谈。随后，两国在10月4日发表了建立外交关系的联合公报。
    他在接见新华社记者时指出，中国和几内亚两国建交，并且签订了文化合作协定，这无疑会对整个非洲大陆产生巨大影响。几内亚人民同中国人民的真正合作的道路已经打开。这种关系是在万隆会议决议的范围内建立的，我们庆贺这种关系。迪亚万杜对于中国庆祝建国十周年的军事检阅和人民游行表示赞赏。他谈到，他在北京曾参观了工业、农业展览会，纺织厂和人民公社。他说，他看到中国人民作了巨大的努力来建设自己的国家，中国工人和农民的生活水平不断提高，中国已经成为世界上最强大的国家之一。谈到非洲民族独立运动的前景，这位来自在一年前取得了独立的国家的代表说，欧洲列强在非洲划分了自己的势力范围，现在非洲人民正在为摆脱殖民主义的压迫而斗争，他们在斗争中得到许多友好国家的帮助。然而，殖民主义者目光短浅，他们仍然相信高尔白（法国殖民主义者）、马兰（南非的殖民主义者）、萨拉查（葡萄牙殖民主义者）的原则。他强调，非洲各国将相继取得独立，它们在独立后将实现非洲的统一。
