　　Did you know?
    Almost half of the total amount of oil extracted worldwide is transported by oil tankers at sea, often traveling thousands of kilometers. On the return voyage, in order to stabilize the ship, oil tankers need to add seawater to the oil storage tanks, and then discharge the already dirty seawater into the sea. A lot of oil therefore mixes into the sea. According to calculations, nearly 50 million tons of seawater are needed at a time to wash the oil storage tanks of the entire fleet of oil tankers. This cleaning work happens several times a year, so nearly 500,000 tons of oil flow into the sea every year.

　　你知道吗？
    全世界开采的石油总量几乎有一半是靠油船在海上运输的，航程常常达数千公里。回航时，为了使船身稳定，油船需要在贮油池中加进海水，然后把已经很脏的海水排入海中。很多石油因此就混入海中。根据计算，为了洗涤全部油船队的贮油池，一次需要将近五千万吨的海水。这种清洁工作一年要碰上几次，这样，每年就有将近五十万吨石油流入海中。
