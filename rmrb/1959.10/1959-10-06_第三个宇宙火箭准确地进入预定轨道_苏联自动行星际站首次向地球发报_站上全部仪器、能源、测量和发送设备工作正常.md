Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: TASS, Moscow, October 4th: The Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket, launched on the morning of October 4th (the second anniversary of the launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite), is continuing its flight toward the moon. At 18:00 Moscow time, the rocket was 145,000 kilometers from Earth, located over the Atlantic region, with coordinates of 8 degrees 36 minutes South latitude and 5 degrees 48 minutes East longitude.

The analysis of measurement data of the orbital parameters of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket proves that the rocket has accurately entered the predetermined orbit. The automatic interplanetary station will approach the moon at the strictly specified time with the predetermined minimum distance, and will bypass the moon, passing behind the invisible part of the lunar disk, and then return towards the Earth.

During the automatic interplanetary station's multi-day flight, complex scientific measurements will be continuously carried out. The measurement data will be transmitted in segments via radio to receiving stations on Earth at pre-calculated intervals. Each transmission from the automatic interplanetary station to the ground intelligence receiving station is initiated by specialized ground equipment from the adjustment calculation center.

Today, the first two-hour transmission of scientific observation data confirmed that all instruments, energy sources, measuring and transmitting equipment on the automatic interplanetary station are working normally. The scientific measurement data obtained from the first transmission is being carefully analyzed.

The next transmission of measurement data from the automatic interplanetary station will be carried out on October 5th.

Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: According to TASS, Moscow: As of 12:00 Moscow time on October 5th, the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket had flown 248,000 kilometers from Earth, located over the eastern Indian Ocean, with coordinates of 14 degrees 20 minutes South latitude and 98 degrees East longitude.

High-speed electronic computers are continuously analyzing the measurement results of the rocket's actual operating parameters. The processed data confirms that the rocket accurately entered the predetermined orbit.

As everyone knows, the speeds of the Soviet Union's first and second cosmic rockets when entering orbit exceeded the second cosmic velocity. In order to ensure that the automatic interplanetary station bypasses the moon and then flies back towards Earth, the initial orbital velocity of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket was slightly lower than the second cosmic velocity. Therefore, the speed of the third cosmic rocket traveling towards the moon is slower than the previous two cosmic rockets.

After detaching from the last stage rocket, the automatic interplanetary station will pass through the closest point to the moon at 17:00 on October 6th, taking approximately two and a half days to complete the distance from Earth to the moon. At this time, the distance between the automatic interplanetary station and the lunar surface will be approximately 7,000 kilometers.

The instruments installed on the automatic interplanetary station are working according to the planned scientific measurement program.

As previously reported, the second transmission of measurement data from the automatic interplanetary station will be from 15:00 to 17:00 on October 5th. In the future, bulletins and scientific observation results regarding the operation of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket will be published once every 24 hours after the automatic interplanetary station broadcasts data and a preliminary analysis of this data is conducted.

The latest bulletin will be published on the evening of October 5th.

### 第三个宇宙火箭准确地进入预定轨道  苏联自动行星际站首次向地球发报  站上全部仪器、能源、测量和发送设备工作正常

    第三个宇宙火箭准确地进入预定轨道
    苏联自动行星际站首次向地球发报
    站上全部仪器、能源、测量和发送设备工作正常
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：在10月4日（苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星两周年纪念日）早晨发射的苏联第三个宇宙火箭，目前正继续向月球飞行。莫斯科时间十八时，火箭离地球十四万五千公里，位置在大西洋地区上空，座标是南纬八度三十六分和东经五度四十八分。
    对苏联第三个宇宙火箭轨道参数测量资料的整理证明，火箭已准确地进入预定的轨道。自动行星际站将在严格规定的时刻以预定的最小距离接近月球，并将绕过月球，从它的后面通过月球圆面的不可见部分，接着返回地球方向。
    在自动行星际站多天的飞行中，将不断进行复杂的科学测量，测量资料将在预先计算好的间隔时间中分段用无线电发到地球上的接收站。自动行星际站向地面情报接收站的每次发报，是由调整计算中心的专门的地面仪器开动的。
    今天第一次发送为时两小时的科学观测资料确定，自动行星际站上的全部仪器、能源、测量和发送设备工作正常。从第一次发报中获得的科学测量资料正在进行仔细的整理。
    下一次从自动行星际站发送测量资料将在10月5日进行。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：到莫斯科时间10月5日十二时为止，苏联第三个宇宙火箭已经飞离地球二十四万八千公里，位于印度洋东部的上空，座标是南纬十四度二十分，东经九十八度正。
    快速电子计算机正在不间断地整理火箭运行的实际参数的测量结果。整理出的资料证实火箭高度准确地进入预定的轨道。
    大家知道，苏联第一个宇宙火箭和第二个宇宙火箭进入轨道时的速度超过了第二宇宙速度，为了保证自动行星际站绕过月球、然后朝地球方向飞回，苏联第三个宇宙火箭的轨道初速稍稍低于第二宇宙速度。因此第三个宇宙火箭向月球方向运行的速度比前两个宇宙火箭慢。
    自动行星际站在脱离最后一级火箭后，于10月6日十七时通过离月球最近的地方，用于走完从地球到月球这段距离的时间大约是两昼夜半。到这时，自动行星际站和月球表面的距离将约为七千公里。
    安装在自动行星际站上的仪器正按照预定的科学测量计划进行工作。
    前已报道，自动行星际站第二次播发测量资料的时间将是10月5日十五时到十七时。今后，关于苏联第三个宇宙火箭运行的公报和科学观测结果将在自动行星际站播发资料和对这些资料进行初步分析以后，每昼夜发表一次。
    最近一次公报将在10月5日晚间发表。
