    报喜队在“社会主义好”的乐曲声中，分八路进入会场。“群英会”的代表全体起立，以长时间的热烈鼓掌欢迎报喜队。这时，辉煌的人民大会堂红旗招展，掌声和腰鼓声响成一片。

    报喜信上说，在全国英雄会师北京的日子里，首都工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸战线的职工们作出了优异的成绩。到27日止，全市已有九十四个工厂提前完成1959年计划，三百一十二个工业企业提前完成了10月份计划，还有两万多青年工人扬鞭纵马跨入了1960年。全市10月份工业总产值计划已提前三天完成。
    报喜信最后说：“为了胜利地完成党交给我们的光荣任务，我们要虚心地向英雄们学习。学习你们忠于党、忠于社会主义事业的高尚品质；学习你们不屈不挠、克服困难的坚强意志；学习你们的共产主义思想和共产主义风格。让我们在毛泽东的旗帜下，互相鼓舞，互相支援，昂首阔步地跃进再跃进，胜利再胜利！”（附图片）
