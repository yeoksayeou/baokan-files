    “Haitian National Liberation Movement” Announces Revolutionary Program
    Overthrow the Dictatorial Tyranny and Establish a National Democratic Government
    This dispatch: The “Haitian National Liberation Movement,” a united front organization leading the Haitian people's opposition to the Duvalier dictatorship, recently announced its revolutionary program to the Haitian people.
    The introduction to this program points out that this program is an instrument for saving the nation. Its mission is to unite all democratic forces and patriots in Haiti to wage a great struggle to overthrow the tyranny and establish a government that defends national and popular interests. The introduction emphasizes that only this broad front of patriots, encompassing various ideological tendencies, can free Haiti from the dictatorial system and create favorable conditions in Haiti for the establishment of a national democratic government, a government that can resolutely implement this program.
    The program demands that the government, born out of the Haitian people's liberation struggle, implement the following reforms in the social, political, and economic structures for the progress of the country:
    (1) In foreign policy: Formulate Haiti's foreign policy based on defending national sovereignty and safeguarding the honor and integrity of the motherland; take measures to implement a policy of mutual support and economic and cultural cooperation with all brotherly peoples of Latin America; advocate the principle of defending the equality of all countries, large and small, mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual cultural and economic exchanges without any political conditions attached that violate national interests.
    (2) In domestic policy: Abolish all decrees, laws, and regulations that harm the democratic rights and freedoms of citizens; guarantee the inviolability of the personal freedom of all citizens, regardless of skin color or class; restore democratic freedoms and formulate a democratic electoral law; stipulate a minimum wage that guarantees the necessary living conditions for workers throughout the country, and effectively implement an eight-hour workday, regardless of skin color or gender.
    (3) In economic policy: Create conditions for the country's industrialization, absorb the cooperation of foreign governments and private capital, as long as their investments are not attached with conditions that harm national interests and these capitals are conducive to the country's development; guarantee freedom of enterprise in trade, industry, and agriculture; protect national production and commerce, and encourage its development, opposing foreign competition.
    (4) Implement land reform: Stipulate the area of land that can be owned privately or by landlords; the state expropriates the surplus land of large landlords; distribute all state land to farmers; abolish all forms of exploitation of farmers in rural areas, and create conditions for the development of a broad agricultural cooperative movement in order to eliminate the one-sidedness of Haiti's agricultural economy. The program concludes by calling on every Haitian citizen to take direct action to realize this program.
