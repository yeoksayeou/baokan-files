　　On the evening of the 7th, I returned from the capital after attending the National Day celebrations. When the train arrived at Tianjin East Station, I didn't go home; I went straight to the factory. After a brief report to the Party Committee, the sisters from my group came to find me. It turned out they were just finishing their middle shift. Everyone pulled me aside, asking all sorts of questions. I told them about seeing Chairman Mao three times and described the new look of the capital, especially conveying in detail the three major tasks proposed by Comrade Li Fuchun. The sisters were extremely happy. They said: "You saw Chairman Mao three times; this is an honor for our entire group. We must resolutely respond to the Party's call and work hard with textile workers across the country to complete the cotton yarn production targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, answering the Party's care for us."

　　On the evening of the 8th, I joined my sisters for the first night shift of the week. Everyone worked with extra enthusiasm that night, full of energy. During the shift, we comprehensively completed the group's production plan, exceeding the cotton yarn production target by more than 340 pounds. We also reduced the amount of cotton waste by more than four pounds, and the doffing time was shortened by four seconds compared to the plan. The entire group didn't have a single empty spindle. On the 10th, we held another group meeting and repeatedly discussed the Party's call to complete this year's Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule. We are determined to work hard to learn from advanced experiences, improve our skills, eliminate empty spindles and defective yarn, and further carry out the socialist emulation campaign of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced, striving for daily red, monthly red, and a full season of red. We guarantee that while improving the quality of cotton yarn, we will increase cotton yarn production in the fourth quarter by 40,000 pounds more than the state plan!

    干劲冲云霄　产量步步高
　　七日晚上，我从首都观礼归来。火车开到天津东站，我没有回家，先来到了工厂。刚刚向党委简单地汇报了一下情况，小组的姐妹们就找我来了。原来她们正好下中班，大家拉着我问长问短，我向大家叙说了三次看见毛主席的情况，又介绍了首都的新面貌，特别详细地传达了李富春同志提出的三大任务。姐妹们都高兴极了，她们说：你三次看见毛主席，这是我们全组的光荣，咱们要坚决响应党的号召，和全国的纺织工人一起努力，提前完成第二个五年计划规定的棉纱产量指标，回答党对我们的关怀。
    八日晚上，我和姐妹们一起上这一星期的第一个夜班。这天夜里大家干得特别带劲，个个精神十足。当班，我们全面地完成了小组生产计划，棉纱产量超额了三百四十多磅，白花少出了四磅多，落纱时间比计划缩短了四秒，全组没出一个空锭子。10日，我们又召开了小组会，反复讨论了党发出的关于提前完成今年跃进计划的号召。大家决心努力学习先进经验，提高技术，消灭空锭和坏纱，进一步开展学、赶、超先进的竞赛，做到日日红、月月红，全季满堂红。保证在提高棉纱质量的条件下，第四季度比国家计划增产四万磅棉纱！
