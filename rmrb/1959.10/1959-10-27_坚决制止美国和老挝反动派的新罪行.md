Resolutely Stop the New Crimes of the United States and the Lao Reactionaries
Commentator of this newspaper

The Lao Sananikone government has decided to illegally try Prince Souphanouvong and the other seven leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. According to American news agencies, they will be falsely accused of “plotting treason.” This is a new conspiracy by the United States, instructing the Sananikone clique to frantically persecute Lao patriots in order to further expand the civil war, and it is also a new crime to completely destroy the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, thereby completely blocking the path to a peaceful resolution of the Lao issue.

Prince Souphanouvong and the other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, in the years when French colonialists cruelly ruled Laos, and in the days when Japanese fascists occupied Laos, Prince Souphanouvong and his comrades rose up and called on the Lao people to resist. The Lao Resistance Forces and guerrillas they organized fought for a long time in the high mountains and rice field jungles of Laos; they persisted in arduous struggles against enemies with modern equipment, using the simplest weapons and even bamboo spears. They established the Lao Free National United Front (the predecessor of the Lao Patriotic Front). The people's armed activities under the leadership of this organization had expanded to one-third of the country as early as 1951, and established a stable liberated area equivalent to one-sixth of the national territory. By the eve of the 1954 Geneva Conference, the Lao Fighting Forces had liberated more than half of the Lao territory. The Lao Free National United Front was reorganized and expanded into the Lao Patriotic Front on January 6, 1956, with Prince Souphanouvong, chairman of the United Front, serving as chairman of the Party Central Committee. The Lao Patriotic Front, according to the Vientiane Agreement it reached with the Lao Royal Government on November 2, 1957, was recognized as a legal political party; and participated in the supplementary election held on May 4, 1958. It won nine seats out of twenty-one seats. Prince Souphanouvong and the other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front who are about to be illegally tried are the members of parliament elected in this supplementary election. In its election platform, the Lao Patriotic Front advocated uniting the entire people and all parties, respecting the king and the constitution, supporting the coalition government, opposing foreign interference in Laos, and building Laos into a peaceful, unified, neutral, democratic, independent, and strong country. This May, after the Lao Sananikone government, instigated by the United States, openly abandoned the Geneva Accords and launched a civil war, while the former Lao Fighting Forces were forced to counterattack the Lao Royal Army, the Lao Patriotic Front repeatedly called on the Royal Government to prioritize the interests of the country and the peace of Indochina, and to resolve the current problems through peaceful negotiations in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. Now the Lao reactionaries are attempting to persecute such patriots who have made outstanding contributions to the struggle for Laos' independence, democracy, and freedom under the fabricated charge of "plotting treason," which nakedly exposes Sananikone's hideous face of relying on US imperialism and selling out the national interests of Laos.

Here, it is necessary to point out that Sananikone government's steps in following the United States and suppressing the patriotic and progressive forces in Laos are a blatant violation of the interests of the Lao people. Because the Lao people wholeheartedly support the Lao Patriotic Front and its leaders, and because the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements clearly affirm the great contributions of the Lao Fighting Forces in the struggle for independence, and recognize the legal rights and legitimate status of the Lao Patriotic Front and former resistance personnel, Sananikone government's current actions cannot but arouse the righteous indignation and opposition of the broad masses of the Lao people, and cannot but make it even more isolated in the face of just world opinion.

It must be pointed out that the conspiracy of the United States and the Sananikone clique to frantically persecute Lao patriots is part of their entire conspiracy to prolong and expand the Lao civil war. According to the Vietnamese "People's Daily," citing news from Laos, the next step of Sananikone government will be to declare the Lao Patriotic Front illegal. In this way, first eliminate the leading organs of the Lao Patriotic Front, and then deprive the Lao Patriotic Front of its legal status; in practice, it fundamentally blocks all possibilities of resolving the Lao issue through peaceful negotiations. Many recent activities of the United States have also provided annotations for its attempt to unscrupulously further expand the Lao civil war. The so-called United Nations "investigation committee," which paved the way for American intervention in Laos, after staging a nearly one-month "investigation" farce in Laos, on the one hand, announced the end of its mission, and on the other hand, left some members stationed in Laos indefinitely, as tools for the United States to carry out aggression in Laos. At the same time, the United States continues to transport military personnel and weapons to Laos, and instructs the Southeast Asia Group to hold multiple meetings to intensify preparations for armed intervention in Laos. And Sananikone himself was also ordered to go to Washington to accept new tasks that would bring disaster to the country and harm the peace of Indochina. These conspiracies show that the United States is stepping up its use of various means to expand the Lao civil war and intensify the tension in the region.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front has issued a call, urging all Lao people to unite more closely and fight against illegal trials, demanding the immediate restoration of the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and others, and demanding the immediate cessation of the civil war. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front sent a telegram to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, requesting that urgent measures be taken to stop the illegal persecution by the Sananikone government and to stop the intervention of US imperialism. The Chinese people fully support the call of the Lao Patriotic Front and fully support the just struggle of the Lao people. We believe that the crimes of the United States and the Sananikone government in persecuting Lao patriots will be condemned by just world opinion. The interests of peace in the Indochina region, Asia, and even the whole world, demand that the new conspiracies of the United States and the Sananikone government to expand the Lao civil war and undermine peace in Indochina and Asia be resolutely stopped, that the freedom of patriotic leaders such as Prince Souphanouvong be restored, and that the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements be able to be respected again.

    坚决制止美国和老挝反动派的新罪行
    本报评论员
    老挝萨纳尼空政府决定对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他七位领导人进行非法审讯。据美国的通讯社透露，他们将被诬控“阴谋叛国”的罪名。这是美国指使萨纳尼空集团疯狂迫害老挝爱国者以便进一步扩大内战的新阴谋，也是它们彻底破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议从而完全堵塞和平解决老挝问题的道路的新罪行。
    苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人，在法国殖民者残酷统治老挝的年代中、在日本法西斯侵占老挝的日子里，苏发努冯亲王和他的战友们奋起号召老挝人民起来反抗。他们组织的寮国抗战部队和游击队，长期转战于老挝的高山峻岭和稻田丛林之间；以最简单的武器甚至使用竹刺长矛，对现代化装备的敌人坚持进行了艰苦的斗争。他们建立了寮国自由民族统一战线（就是老挝爱国战线党的前身）。这个组织领导下的人民武装活动，早在1951年已扩及全国三分之一的土地，并且建立了相当于六分之一国土的稳固的解放区。到1954年日内瓦会议开幕前夕，寮国战斗部队已经解放了老挝一半以上的国土。寮国自由民族统一战线于1956年1月6日改组和扩大而成为老挝爱国战线党，由统一战线的主席苏发努冯亲王担任党中央委员会主席。老挝爱国战线党根据它同老挝王国政府1957年11月2日达成的万象协议，被承认为合法政党；并且参加了1958年5月4日举行的补充选举。在二十一个议席中当选九席。即将被非法审讯的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他几位领导人，就是这次补充选举中当选的国会议员。老挝爱国战线党在竞选纲领中主张，团结全民和各党派、尊重国王和宪法，拥护联合政府，反对外国干涉老挝，把老挝建成一个和平、统一、中立、民主、独立和强盛的国家。今年5月，老挝萨纳尼空政府在美国唆使下公然毁弃日内瓦协议，发动内战以后，前寮国战斗部队在被迫反击老挝王国军队进攻的同时，老挝爱国战线党曾一再呼吁王国政府以国家的利益为重、以印度支那的和平为贵，按照日内瓦协议和万象协议的规定，通过和平谈判解决当前问题。现在老挝反动派对这样一些为争取老挝的独立、民主、自由有过杰出贡献的爱国者，竟妄图在“阴谋叛国”的莫须有的罪名下加以迫害，这就赤裸裸地暴露了萨纳尼空投靠美帝国主义，出卖老挝民族利益的狰狞面目。
    这里，有必要指出，萨纳尼空政府所采取的追随美国、镇压老挝的爱国和进步力量的步骤，是公然违反老挝人民的利益的。由于老挝人民衷心拥戴老挝爱国战线党和它的领袖，由于日内瓦协议和万象协议明确肯定了寮国战斗部队在争取独立的斗争中的巨大功劳，并承认老挝爱国战线党和前抗战人员在法律上的权利和合法地位，萨纳尼空政府当前的做法，就不能不激起老挝广大人民的义愤和反对，也不能不使它在世界公正舆论面前更加孤立。
    必须指出，美国和萨纳尼空集团疯狂迫害老挝爱国者的阴谋，是它们延长和扩大老挝内战的整个阴谋的一部分。据越南“人民报”援引来自老挝的消息，萨纳尼空政府下一步将宣布老挝爱国战线党为非法。这样，首先消灭老挝爱国战线党的领导机关，继而剥夺老挝爱国战线党的合法地位；实际就从根本上堵塞了一切通过和平谈判解决老挝问题的可能性。美国最近的许多活动，也为它企图肆无忌惮地进一步扩大老挝内战的阴谋提供了注解。为美国干涉老挝开拓道路的所谓联合国的“调查委员会”，在老挝演出了将近一月的“调查”丑剧以后，一方面宣布任务结束，另一方面却留下一部分成员无限期驻在老挝，作为美国在老挝进行侵略活动的工具。与此同时，美国不断向老挝运进军事人员和武器，并指使东南亚集团多次开会加紧准备武装干涉老挝。而萨纳尼空本人也奉命到华盛顿去接受祸国殃民的和危害印度支那和平的新任务。这些阴谋活动表明，美国正在加紧运用各种手段扩大老挝内战，加剧这个地区的紧张局势。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会已发出号召，呼吁全体老挝人民更加紧密地团结起来，为反对非法审讯、要求立即恢复苏发努冯亲王等人的自由、要求立即停止内战而斗争。同时，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会致电日内瓦会议两主席，要求采取紧急措施制止萨纳尼空政府的非法迫害，制止美帝国主义的干涉行为。中国人民完全支持老挝爱国战线党的呼吁，完全支持老挝人民的正义斗争。我们相信，美国和萨纳尼空政府迫害老挝爱国者的罪行，将受到世界公正舆论的谴责。印度支那地区、亚洲以至全世界的和平的利益，要求坚决制止美国和萨纳尼空政府扩大老挝内战、破坏印度支那和亚洲和平的新阴谋，恢复苏发努冯亲王等爱国领袖的自由，使日内瓦协议和万象协议能够重新得到尊重。
