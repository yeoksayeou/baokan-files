　　My Political and Legal Science Association Issues Statement
    Supporting the Just Struggle of the Spanish People
    Demanding the Release of Political Prisoners by the Franco Authorities
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The China Political and Legal Science Association issued a statement on the 10th, firmly supporting the Spanish people's movement to win amnesty for political prisoners.
    The statement said: "The China Political and Legal Science Association and all Chinese legal workers unanimously and firmly support the Spanish people's struggle to restore all democratic freedoms and rights, and to grant amnesty to all imprisoned and exiled political prisoners. We believe that this is a struggle to uphold the modern, universally recognized legal norms for guaranteeing democratic freedoms and basic human rights, and it is completely just and humane.
      "Twenty years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Franco government still keeps tens of thousands of political prisoners in prisons, completely depriving them of all freedom and subjecting them to inhumane treatment. At the same time, it has deprived tens of thousands of Spanish patriots of the right to live freely in their own country, forcing them into exile abroad. Recently, the Franco government has further completely deprived the Spanish people of their democratic rights and freedoms with the so-called new law on 'social order', and intensified the large-scale persecution and suppression of patriotic and democratic forces. The illegal arrest of the Spanish people's fighter Simon Sanchez Montero and the unfounded sentencing of him to twenty years in prison is a concrete manifestation of the Franco government's rampant attack on Spanish patriotic and democratic forces. The people of the world and all just people in the legal community are deeply indignant at this fascist behavior of disregarding modern universally recognized legal norms, trampling on basic human rights, and destroying democracy and freedom."
    The statement said, "In order to uphold justice, safeguard human rights, and guarantee democratic freedom, the China Political and Legal Science Association and all Chinese legal workers unanimously and firmly support the Spanish people's demand for amnesty for all political prisoners, and demand the immediate release of Montero and other persecuted patriotic and democratic people. The China Political and Legal Science Association calls on all upright legal workers in the world to take all possible and effective actions to support the Spanish people's struggle to restore all democratic freedoms and rights."

　　我政治法律学会发表声明
    支持西班牙人民正义斗争
    要求佛朗哥当局释放政治犯
    据新华社讯　中国政治法律学会10日发表声明，坚决支持西班牙人民争取大赦政治犯的运动。
    声明说：“中国政治法律学会和全中国法律工作者一致坚决支持西班牙人民争取恢复一切民主自由权利、大赦所有被囚禁和流亡在外的政治犯的斗争，我们让为这是维护现代公认的保障民主自由和基本人权的法律准则的斗争，完全是正义的和人道的。
      “在西班牙内战结束后二十年的今天，佛朗哥政府竟仍然在监狱里囚禁着成千上万的政治犯，使他们完全丧失了一切自由，并受到非人道的待遇，同时还剥夺了西班牙成千上万的爱国者在自己祖国自由生活的权利，迫使他们流亡国外。最近，佛朗哥政府又以所谓关于‘社会秩序’的新法律来进一步完全剥夺西班牙人民的民主权利和自由，加紧对爱国民主力量的大规模的迫害与镇压。非法逮捕西班牙人民战士西蒙·桑切斯·蒙特罗，并毫无根据地判处他二十年徒刑的事件，这是佛朗哥政府又一次向西班牙爱国民主力量猖狂进攻的具体表现。对于这种蔑视现代公认的法律准则，蹂躏基本人权，摧残民主自由的法西斯行为，全世界的人民和法律界的一切有正义感的人士都深为愤慨。”
    声明说，“为了申张正义、维护人权、保障民主自由，中国政治法律学会和全中国法律工作者一致坚决支持西班牙人民争取大赦所有政治犯的要求，并要求立即释放蒙特罗和其他受迫害的爱国民主人士。中国政治法律学会向全世界一切正直的法律工作者呼吁，采取一切可能的、有效的行动，声援西班牙人民争取恢复一切民主自由权利的斗争。”
