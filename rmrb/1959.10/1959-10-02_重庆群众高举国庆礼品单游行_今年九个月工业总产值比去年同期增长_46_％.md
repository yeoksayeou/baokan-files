Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 1st: Today, one hundred thousand people in downtown Chongqing held a grand rally and parade to warmly celebrate the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The mountain city of Chongqing was today decorated with palace lanterns, flowers, colorful flags, and paifang, filled with joy. People participating in the parade flocked to Liberation Monument Square from all directions early in the morning. Hundreds of colorful balloons, released from the parade, carried large banners with slogans such as "Long Live the General Line," "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," "Long Live the People's Communes," and "Long Live Chairman Mao," slowly rising into the sky.

Among the worker contingents, thousands upon thousands of slogans, charts, models, and physical objects vividly demonstrated the tremendous changes in the city's industry over the past ten years. In the ranks of the steel workers, workers carried two golden dragons, one representing the mass steelmaking production line, and the other representing the steel workers' offensive to seize steel with low sulfur. Due to the mass steelmaking and the steel workers' enthusiastic campaign to seize steel, the city's steel industry has achieved rapid development. In 1958, the city's steel production increased by 67.6 times compared to 1949, and steel production increased by 78.2 times. The production charts and models and physical objects carried by the worker contingents in various industries also showed that the city's industrial development was not only high-speed but also comprehensively balanced. While the iron and steel and machinery industries developed at high speed, coal, electricity, transportation, and other industries also experienced rapid development; while heavy industry developed at high speed, light industry and the chemical industry, which are closely related to people's lives, have also greatly developed.

Thousands of production charts and gift lists dedicated to the 10th anniversary of National Day show that the city's workers have achieved even more brilliant achievements in production this year. From January to September of this year, compared with the same period last year, the city's total industrial output value increased by more than 46%, the output of steel and coal increased by more than 72%, and metal-cutting machine tools increased by 78%.

The teams of people's commune members and commercial employees from the city's suburbs were warmly welcomed. Their charts show that the suburbs have basically completed the city's full-year plan for non-staple food development this year.

The districts and counties under the jurisdiction of Chongqing's suburbs also held rallies and parades of 1.4 million people today.
