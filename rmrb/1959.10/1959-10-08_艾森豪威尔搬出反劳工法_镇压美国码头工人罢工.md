    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 7th: U.S. President Eisenhower invoked the notorious Taft-Hartley anti-labor law on the 6th, publicly intervening to undermine and suppress the major strike by 100,000 dockworkers on the American East Coast.
    Eisenhower, on the pretext that the dockworkers' strike "endangers (U.S.) national health and safety," brazenly interfered in the strike. He has already, according to the Taft-Hartley Act, appointed a three-member committee to conduct a so-called "investigation" of the dockworkers' strike, as the first step in using this law to suppress the strike. He intends, upon receiving the committee's so-called "investigation report" within the month, to order the court to compel the dockworkers to return to work for eighty days, thereby depriving the workers of their right to strike and forcing them to submit.
    According to Western news agencies, Eisenhower's action is a prelude to his intention to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to suppress the strike of 500,000 American steelworkers, which has lasted for nearly three months. White House Press Secretary Hagerty also quoted Eisenhower on the 6th as saying that the U.S. President believes that the current strike by American steelworkers "is not the kind of collective bargaining that free people can use in major economic disputes."

    艾森豪威尔搬出反劳工法
    镇压美国码头工人罢工
    据新华社7日讯　纽约消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔6日引用臭名远扬的塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，公开出面，破坏和镇压美国东海岸十万码头工人的大罢工。
    艾森豪威尔借口码头工人罢工“损害（美国）国家健康和安全”，悍然干涉罢工。他已经根据塔夫脱—哈特莱法指定一个三人委员会对码头工人罢工进行所谓“调查”，作为运用这个法律镇压罢工的第一步。他打算本月内接到这个委员会的所谓“调查报告”后，就命令法院勒令码头工人复工八十天，以此剥夺工人罢工权利，迫使码头工人屈服。
    据西方通讯社透露，艾森豪威尔的这一行动，是他打算援用塔夫脱—哈特莱法来镇压已坚持近三个月的美国五十万钢铁工人大罢工的先声。白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂6日也引用艾森豪威尔的话说，美国总统认为目前美国钢铁工人的罢工“并不是自由人民在重大的经济争端中可以使用的那种集体谈判手段”。
