Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 16th. The workers constructing the northern entrance of the Liangfengya Tunnel on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway achieved a monthly tunnel advance of 183.83 meters in September, setting a new national record for monthly tunnel construction.

The Liangfengya Tunnel is one of the three major control projects on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, with a total length of 4,270 meters. Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers constructing this tunnel identified many methods to improve work efficiency in September, targeting the weak links in projects such as lining. When transportation couldn't keep up, they strengthened and improved internal tunnel transportation scheduling operations. Originally, a round trip for a battery car took more than three hours; later, it was shortened to two hours. At the same time, the materials and transportation departments closely coordinated to ensure the timely supply of major materials, tools, and cement, greatly accelerating the project.

Currently, the workers at the northern entrance are helping the workers at the southern entrance to catch up, in order to jointly ensure that the target of 700 meters of tunnel advancement is achieved in October and November.

　　凉风垭职工阔步猛进
    创隧道工程新纪录
    新华社贵阳16日电　修建川黔铁路凉风垭隧道北端洞口工程的职工，9月份隧道月成洞达到一百八十三点八十三米，创造了全国隧道工程月成洞的新纪录。
    凉风垭隧道工程是川黔铁路上三大控制工程之一，隧道全长四千二百七十米。修建这座隧道的职工们在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，在9月份针对着衬砌等工程中的薄弱环节，找出了许多提高工效的办法。运输跟不上，他们就加强和改进洞内运输调度作业。原来一列电瓶车往返一趟要三小时以上，后来缩短到两小时。同时，材料和运输部门密切配合，及时保证了主要材料、工具和水泥等的供应，使工程大大加快。
    目前，北端洞口职工正在帮助南端洞口职工赶上来，以便共同保证在10月和11月达到成洞七百米的指标。
