Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 26th: Over ten thousand people from all ethnic groups in Yinchuan, including leading organs and organizations of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and various circles of Yinchuan City, gathered on the afternoon of the 25th to warmly celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

    The celebration meeting was held in Zhongshan Park, Yinchuan City. Hui and Han workers from various factories, all full of spirit, some holding high letters of determination guaranteeing the overfulfillment of this year's production plan, some carrying colorful flags and signs with slogans like "Celebrating the Great Victory of the Party's National Regional Autonomy Policy," participated in the celebration meeting. Commune members from the suburban people's communes, dressed in festive attire, happily came to the venue. Students and citizens all participated in the meeting with bouquets of flowers.

    Liu Geping, Secretary of the CPC Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee Secretariat and Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, spoke at the celebration meeting. He first expressed, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia, his gratitude to the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao for their concern for the people of Ningxia. Then, he summarized the brilliant achievements made by the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region in various construction endeavors over the past year under the glorious guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction and its national policy. He said that the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region further boosted the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in the region to build socialism, strengthened the unity and cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups, and promoted the development of socialist construction throughout the region. After a year of efforts, the backward economic and cultural appearance of the Ningxia region is rapidly changing, and various production and construction undertakings have developed vigorously. On the agricultural front, great harvests were continuously achieved in 1958 and 1959. The per unit area yield and total output of grain and cash crops have significantly increased. Animal husbandry production has also greatly developed, with the number of sheep in the region increasing by more than 42% this year compared to last year. On the industrial front, more than 350 state-owned industrial and mining enterprises have been established, and industrial output value has grown rapidly, greatly changing the industrial landscape of the Ningxia region. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also seen significant development. In particular, the realization of the people's commune system has powerfully promoted the development of production and construction and the prosperity of various undertakings in the autonomous region. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in the region are advancing towards the level of advanced socialist nations with great efforts, eliminating the de facto inequality between ethnic groups in the economic and cultural fields left over by history.

    Liu Geping finally called on the people of all ethnic groups in the region to continue to deeply implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose right-leaning tendencies, exert great efforts, unite as one, hold high the red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, advance victoriously, and strive to over fulfill this year's production plan ahead of schedule, laying the foundation for continued leaps forward next year. To this end, on the agricultural front, it is necessary to do a good job in the mass movement that centers on agricultural production, including large-scale water conservancy projects, deep plowing of land, accumulation and creation of fertilizer, vigorous development of sideline production, and development of short-distance transportation. On the industrial front, the spirit of the representative meeting of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the autonomous region's industry, transportation, and capital construction sectors should be conscientiously implemented, and efforts should be made to complete this year's production plan half a month to twenty days ahead of schedule. All other fronts should also seize the last two months of this year to do a good job, and strive to complete this year's various plans ahead of schedule, completely, and overfulfill them.

    On the evening of that day, cadres of the autonomous region's organs and people from all ethnic groups in Yinchuan City also held a garden party celebrating the first anniversary of the founding of the autonomous region. All counties and cities in the autonomous region also held celebration meetings and get-togethers on this day to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the autonomous region.
