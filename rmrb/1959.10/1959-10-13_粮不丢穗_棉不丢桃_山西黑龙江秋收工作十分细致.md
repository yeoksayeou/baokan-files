Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th: In Shanxi Province, people's communes are universally ensuring that not a grain is left in the field, not a boll left on the cotton plant, not a seed left from the oil crops, and not a leaf left from the vegetables during the autumn harvest. At present, over half of the province's more than 45 million mu of autumn crops have been harvested, and more than half of that has been safely stored.

This year, various regions in Shanxi Province have generally regarded meticulous harvesting and threshing as a continuation of the production increase campaign. Various regions have organized the more than 4 million commune members involved in the autumn harvest into four professional teams for harvesting, transporting, threshing, and gleaning, and have established a division of labor system of harvesters responsible for clean fields, transporters responsible for clean roads, and threshers responsible for clean stalks, as well as a linked inspection and acceptance responsibility system. Because ideological mobilization was sufficient and preparations were thorough, in order to make the autumn harvest work even more meticulous, the Jinnan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently launched a re-harvesting and re-threshing campaign in the entire district to strive for an additional 15 jin of grain per mu of grain field and 10 jin of cotton per mu of cotton field. At present, after re-harvesting and re-threshing, Jinnan Prefecture has recovered an additional 5.5 million jin of grain and 7.5 million jin of cotton. People's communes in Jinbei Prefecture have universally launched a competition of three harvests, three threshings, and three winnowings – harvesting after harvesting, threshing after threshing, and winnowing after winnowing – ensuring a full harvest in a good year, leaving not a single ear or grain behind. People's communes in Jin southeast Prefecture implemented methods of harvesting according to the weather, harvesting according to ripeness, and harvesting early in the morning with dew when harvesting millet, sorghum, and beans; and handled and transported them with care. Some mountain villages with inconvenient transportation also newly opened more than 54,000 transportation routes, changing human carrying to donkey carrying or cart pulling. Some communes also built fields and temporary warehouses in places far from the village, greatly reducing losses during harvesting, threshing, and transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th: This year, Heilongjiang Province's autumn harvest work is fast and good. At present, the number of people participating in the autumn harvest in the province has reached more than 3.8 million, accounting for more than one-third of the total rural population. More than 60% of the province's more than 80 million mu of autumn crops have been harvested. In Hulan, Acheng, Bin County, and other five counties with faster harvest progress, the autumn harvest work has been basically completed.

During the autumn harvest, people's communes throughout the province universally launched autumn harvest competitions between communes, districts, teams, and groups, and soldier against soldier, general against general, making the autumn harvest production proceed quickly and well. Since the beginning of the autumn harvest, due to heavy rainfall in Heilongjiang Province, some crops have become overly lush, and varying degrees of uneven crop maturity have occurred in various places. For plots that ripen first, manpower must be concentrated to rush the harvest. People's communes, under the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, uniformly organized large-scale autumn harvest cooperation and launched reinforcement and rush harvesting activities. In late September, the Jinhe People's Commune in Suihua County had rice fields in eight paddy field management areas that were ready for harvesting, but there was a shortage of labor. The commune immediately transferred more than 4,000 people from eleven dry land management areas to help, enabling the more than 40,000 mu of rice to be harvested 15 days earlier than originally planned.

Various places have universally achieved meticulous harvesting in the harvest. More than 7 million mu of crops that have been harvested throughout the province have been pulled into the yards, and more than 2 million mu of crops have been threshed and stored, which is a new phenomenon that has not appeared in previous autumn harvests. A nationwide grain-gleaning campaign has already taken shape in the province. At present, more than 240,000 people have participated in grain-gleaning, and more than 6.4 million jin of grain have been harvested.

　　粮不丢穗　棉不丢桃
    山西黑龙江秋收工作十分细致
    据新华社太原11日电　山西省各人民公社在秋收中，普遍做到粮不丢穗，棉不丢桃，油不丢颗，菜不丢叶。目前，全省四千五百多万亩秋作物已收割过半，其中有一半以上已安全入仓。
    山西省各地今年普遍把细收细打作为超产运动的继续。各地把投入秋收的四百多万名社员，组成收割、运输、打场、拾粮四支专业队伍，建立了收割人员包地净、运输人员包路净、打场人员包秸秆净的分工制度和连环检查检收的责任制度。由于思想发动充分，准备工作完善，为使秋收工作一细再细，中共晋南地委最近在全区发起了争取每亩粮田多收十五斤粮、每亩棉田多收十斤棉的复收复打运动。目前晋南全专区经过复收复打已多收回粮食五百五十万斤，棉花七百五十万斤。晋北专区各人民公社普遍展开了收完又收再收、打完又打再打、扬完又扬再扬的三收三打三扬的竞赛，做到了十成年景十成收，一穗一粒也不丢。晋东南专区各人民公社在收割谷子、高粱和豆类作物时，实行了看天收获、看成收获和趁早晨有露水收割的方法；运输中轻担轻放。一些交通不便的山庄还新开辟了五万四千多条运输道路，把人担变为驴驮或车拉。有的公社还在离村较远的地方建场，设立临时仓库，大大减少了收、打、运中的损耗。
    据新华社哈尔滨11日电　今年黑龙江省的秋收工作又快又好。目前，全省参加秋收的人数达三百八十多万，占农村总人口三分之一还多。全省八千多万亩秋庄稼已收了60％以上。收割进度快的呼兰、阿城、宾县等五个县，秋收工作已基本结束。
    秋收中全省各地人民公社普遍开展了社与社、区与区、队与队、组与组，兵对兵、将对将的秋收竞赛运动，使秋收生产进行得又快又好。秋收开始以来，黑龙江省由于雨水较多，部分庄稼发生贪青，各地都出现了不同程度的庄稼成熟不平衡现象，先熟的地块，必须集中人力突击抢收。人民公社在等价互利的原则下，统一组织了秋收大协作，开展了增援抢收活动。绥化县津河人民公社，9月下旬有八个水田管理区的稻田已到收割时期，但是劳力不足，公社立即从十一个旱田管理区抽调了四千多人来帮助，使这四万多亩水稻，比原计划提前十五天收割完毕。
    各地在收割中普遍作到了细割细收。全省已割完的庄稼，有七百多万亩作物已拉进场院，有二百多万亩作物已脱粒归仓，这是在历年来的秋收中没有出现过的新景象。全民性的拣粮运动已经在全省形成，目前有二十四万多人参加了拣粮，多收了粮食六百四十多万斤。
