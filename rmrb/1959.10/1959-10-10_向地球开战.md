A county, in just over a year, from south to north, from west to east, has dug irrigation and drainage canals, main canals, branch canals, and ditch canals, totaling tens of thousands of *li* in length; that is, about the same length as the Yangtze River.

A county, in just over a year, has dug canals, built dikes, constructed sluice gates, and installed culverts. In order to make the floodwaters obedient and follow human commands, it has moved more than 48 million cubic meters of earth; that is, if arranged into a platform three *chi* high and three *chi* wide, it would be 96,000 *li* long, more than enough to circle the earth.

It is this county that, in just over a year, relying on these water conservancy projects, has made it possible to irrigate more than one million *mu* of land during droughts and drain it during floods; more than 200,000 *mu* of barren alkaline land has been transformed into rich granaries. This year, it was hit by torrential rains, but the more than one million *mu* of land in the county that was still saline-alkali land and low-lying land a year ago had a bumper harvest in the summer and another bumper harvest in the autumn – wheat production doubled, and autumn grain production was also unprecedented.

Which county's heroic people created such heroic achievements? Cang County, Hebei. Cang County, near the desolate beach; out of a total of 1.68 million *mu* of cultivated land, 1.25 million *mu* were previously a vast expanse of white saline-alkali land and waterlogged low-lying land; another 430,000 *mu* were on soil ridges most susceptible to drought. In the slightly more distant past, it was the place where people who had violated the "law of the king" were "exiled." Now, after the establishment of the people's communes here, people are using their own hands to "reverse the universe."

With such great achievements, can we still not believe in the power of the masses of the people, who have formed a huge collective under the banner of the people's communes? However, as soon as it is proposed to continue the Great Leap Forward and continue to vigorously develop water conservancy, some people clamor, saying that the pace is too big and the progress is too fast; they are throwing stones into the Yangtze River of mass movements,妄想 (wàngxiǎng)妄想trying to stop the torrent. The struggle between revolutionary advanced thinking and right-leaning conservative thinking will exist in any place and at any time. The result of each struggle will inevitably arouse more powerful and magnificent waves of mass movements.

With such great achievements, can we stop for a while? No! The masses do not think so. They have had enough of the anger of water and drought disasters for many years! This year, the disaster wanted to show off its power again, but it encountered the iron wall of the people's commune; the masses were so happy to see it! Seeing that the threat of disaster has not been completely eliminated, the existing achievements have made people feel full of energy and courage. How can they not take advantage of the victory and forge ahead bravely, and carry the struggle to the end, completely and thoroughly eliminating drought and flood disasters?

The Cang County Party Committee truly understands the hearts of the masses. They have seen the favorable situation for continuing to vigorously develop water conservancy this year, and have put forward a grand plan to completely conquer drought and flood disasters next year: they will have to do another 24.6 million earthworks – let the earthworks circle more than half the earth again! They also have to do a lot of work to make the original projects more solid, to control the water more strictly; and to turn the water into huge electricity for people to use. Through water conservancy alone, next year, the land will yield another 200 million *jin* of grain!

This is just one county, one of more than 1,700 counties in the country, one of some counties with a particularly bad natural environment among the more than 1,700 counties. If all 1,700 plus counties launch such a large-scale offensive, waging war against the earth, we will surely be able to completely change this large piece of land on the earth – a large piece of 9.6 million square kilometers – at the highest speed!

    向地球开战
    杨岭
    一个县，一年多的时间，从南到北，从西而东，开挖了灌溉用的和排水用的干渠、支渠、斗渠，加起来长达万里；也就是说，同长江的长度差不多。
    一个县，一年多的时间，开渠修堤，筑闸设涵，为了要大水服服贴贴听从人的命令，做了土方四千八百多万立方公尺；也就是说，摆成三尺高三尺宽的土台，共长九万六千里，绕地球一周而绰绰有余。
    就是这个县，一年多的时间，靠着这些水利工程，使一百多万亩土地旱了能浇水，涝了能排水；二十多万亩荒碱场变成了丰盛的大粮仓。今年连遭倾盆大雨袭击，可是，全县一百多亩一年前还是盐碱地和低洼地的土地，今年夏季大丰收，秋季还是大丰收——小麦产量翻一番，秋粮产量也空前。
    是哪个县的英雄人民，创造了这样的英雄业绩？河北沧县。沧县，靠近荒凉的海滩；总共一百六十八亩耕地，过去就有一百二十五万亩是白茫茫一片的盐碱地和水汪汪一片低洼地；另外四十三万亩，又在最怕旱的土岭上。在稍远一些的历史上，是犯了“王法”的人“发配”之地。而今，这里成立了人民公社之后，人们在用自己的双手“扭转乾坤”。
    有了这样伟大的成就，还能不相信在人民公社的旗帜下组成巨大的集体的人民群众的力量吗？可是，一提出来要继续大跃进，继续大办水利，却又有人嚷嚷，说步子迈得太大了，走得太快了；又在向群众运动的长江大河里投石子，妄想阻挡奔腾不息的潮流。革命的先进的思想同右倾的保守的思想的斗争，在任何地方，任何时候都是会有的。每一次斗争的结果，必然是激起群众运动的更有力更壮阔的波澜。
    有了这样大的成就，可以停一停了吧？不！群众不是这样想的。多少年来受水旱灾害的气，早受够了！这一年灾害又想耍威风，碰到的却是人民公社这样的铜墙铁壁；群众看着太痛快了！眼看灾害的威胁还没有完全扫除，已有的成就又使人们觉得自己混身是劲、混身是胆，怎能不乘胜勇猛前进，把斗争进行到底，干净彻底全部地消灭旱涝灾害呢？
    沧县县委真正懂得群众的心。他们看清了今年继续大兴水利的有利形势，提出了明年一年彻底征服旱涝灾害的宏伟的规划：要再做二千四百六十万个土方——再让土方绕大半个地球！还要做大量的工作，使原有的工程更加巩固，把水更严格地管制起来；还要叫水变成巨大的电力供人使唤。通过水利这一项，明年一年要土地再多交出两亿斤粮食来！
    这不过是一个县，全国一千七百多个县之中的一个，一千七百多个县之中自然环境特别不好的一些县份中的一个。一千七百多个县都这样大举进攻，向地球开战，我们一定能把地球上的这一大块——九百六十万平方公里的一大块，用最高的速度彻底变个样子！
