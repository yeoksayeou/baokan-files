Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 25th: The 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is approaching. The Soviet working people are currently carrying out competitions with even greater labor enthusiasm, striving to make greater achievements in increasing production, practicing thrift, and technological innovation, to present gifts to this great festival. Now, from the industrial and agricultural production fronts across the country, many good news of pre-festival competitions have been reported one after another.

    The Moscow Oblast Economic Region, the Leningrad City Economic Region, as well as the Belorussian, Lithuanian, Sverdlovsk, Kiev, and Gorky Economic Regions, launched competitions to welcome the 42nd anniversary of the October Revolution, and all have completed the gross industrial output plan for the first ten months of this year and the production plans for the vast majority of important industrial products ten days ahead of schedule. Compared with the same period last year, the gross industrial output of the Moscow Oblast Economic Region increased by more than 9% in the first ten months of this year compared with the same period last year, and the plan to increase labor productivity was overfulfilled. The industrial output value of the Lithuanian Economic Zone for ten months increased by 14% compared with the same period last year. The gross industrial output of the Sverdlovsk Economic Region in the first ten months also greatly exceeded the same period last year. Under the bold creation of the workers, the machinery manufacturing factories mastered the production of 130 new types of machines and tools. In the competition to welcome the October Revolution Festival, industrial enterprises in various places have also achieved achievements in increasing production, practicing thrift, and reducing costs. Workers at the Urgal Coal Mine in the Bolie Border Area over-extracted 33,000 tons of coal in nine months, and saved more than 2 million rubles for the country by reducing costs. All the miners of Mine No. 5, which belongs to the Tkvarcheli Coal Industry Trust of the Georgian Republic, originally planned to over-produce 7,000 tons of coal for the country this year, but in the hot competition to welcome the October Revolution Festival, this indicator was overfulfilled ahead of schedule. By the beginning of October, they had already over-produced 9,000 tons of coal for the country.

    On the construction sites of the Seven-Year Plan across the Soviet Union, the upsurge in welcoming the October Revolution Festival has further accelerated the progress of engineering construction. At the world-renowned Bratsk Hydropower Station construction site, workers are currently fighting to accelerate the construction of the dam of the power station. The amount of concrete poured every day and night has increased from the original 1,852 cubic meters to 3,012 cubic meters. The Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Combine recently completed a new blast furnace ahead of schedule. Currently, workers are accelerating the internal installation work of the new blast furnace, striving to ignite and produce iron ahead of schedule.

    In the competition to welcome the festival, Soviet workers have also made many achievements in improving production technology and accelerating the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production.

    On the agricultural front, laborers in various places have also reported good news to the motherland. More than 40 states in Ukraine, Belarus, and the Russian Federal Republic have completed this year's annual livestock product production plan two months ahead of schedule in the competition to welcome the festival. On October 21, four more states in Ukraine, including Ternopol and Kirovograd, overfulfilled the annual meat and milk production plans two months ahead of schedule. In addition, in areas such as Eastern Siberia, Altai, and Kazakhstan, where grain is still being harvested, agricultural laborers are fighting hard these days, striving to complete the plan to sell grain to the state during the festival. Agricultural laborers in the Central Asian republics are busy harvesting cotton. Uzbek cotton growers are working hard to deliver 3.5 million tons of seed cotton to the state. The Tashkent, Andijan, and other states of the republic have organized Communist Youth League shock cotton picking production teams, and team members have launched cotton picking competitions one after another, striving to complete all cotton picking work during the festival.

    提前十天完成头十月工业总产值计划
    新华社莫斯科25日电　伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年已经临近。苏联劳动人民目前正以更高的劳动热情展开竞赛，争取在增产节约、技术革新方面作出更大的成绩，向这一伟大节日献礼。现在，从全国各地工业和农业生产战线上，已经纷纷传来许多节前竞赛的捷报。
    莫斯科州经济区、列宁格勒市经济区以及白俄罗斯、立陶宛、斯维德洛夫斯克、基辅、高尔基等经济区，为迎接十月革命四十二周年展开了竞赛，并且都已提前十天完成了今年头十个月的工业总产值计划和绝大部分重要工业产品的生产计划。与去年同期比较，莫斯科州经济区今年头十个月的工业总产值比去年同期增加了9％以上，并且超额完成了提高劳动生产率计划。立陶宛经济区十个月的工业总产值比去年同期增加了14％。斯维德洛夫斯克经济区头十个月的工业总产值也大大超过去年的同一时期，在职工们的大胆创造下，各机器制造厂共掌握了一百三十种新型机器和工具的生产。在迎接十月革命节的竞赛中，各地工业企业在增产节约和降低成本的运动方面也获得了成就。伯力边疆区乌尔加尔煤矿的工人们在九个月内超额开采了三万三千吨煤，并从降低成本中为国家节约了二百多万卢布。格鲁吉亚共和国特克瓦尔切尔煤业托辣斯所属五号矿井的全体矿工原定在今年超计划为国家多开采七千吨煤，但是，在热火朝天地展开迎接十月革命节的竞赛中，这个指标就提前超额完成了，到10月上旬，他们已经为国家超计划开采了九千吨煤。
    在苏联各地七年计划建设工地上，迎接十月革命节的热潮使工程建设进度进一步加快了。在驰名世界的布拉次克水电站工地上，这些天来工人们正为加速电站的水坝建设而战斗，每昼夜浇灌的混凝土已从原先的一千八百五十二立方米提高到三千零一十二立方米。下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂最近提前建成了一座新高炉，目前工人们正在加速新高炉的各项内部安装工作，争取提前生火出铁。
    在迎接节日的竞赛中，苏联工人还在改进生产技术、加速生产的全面机械化和自动化方面取得了不少成就。
    在农业战线上，各地劳动者也纷纷向祖国喜报佳音。乌克兰、白俄罗斯和俄罗斯联邦共和国的四十多个州在迎接节日的竞赛中，已经提前两个月完成了今年全年的畜产品生产计划。10月21日，乌克兰又有特尔诺波尔、基洛夫格勒等四个州提前两个月超额完成全年的肉类和牛奶生产计划。此外，在东西伯利亚、阿尔泰、哈萨克等还在收割谷物的地区，农业劳动者这些天来正在奋战，争取在节日里完成向国家交售粮食的计划。中亚细亚各加盟共和国的农业劳动者正在紧张收摘棉花。乌兹别克植棉者正为争取交给国家三百五十万吨籽棉而努力。共和国的塔什干、安集延等州组织了共青团突击摘棉生产队，队员之间纷纷展开摘棉竞赛，争取在节日里全部完成摘棉工作。
