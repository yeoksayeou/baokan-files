Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: At today's meeting of secretaries of the Military Armistice Commission, the Korean-Chinese side protested to the U.S. side regarding a series of recent incidents of violations of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side.

At the meeting, the secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out the following facts: At around 8:25 AM on September 20th, five U.S. armed personnel conducted reconnaissance in the area of Mamingdong near the U.S. side and suddenly fired nine rifle bullets at the civilian police of the Korean-Chinese side who were conducting normal patrols about 100 meters north of the military demarcation line. At around 10:10 AM on September 11th, seven U.S. armed personnel crossed the military demarcation line, violating the armistice agreement by intruding into the Korean-Chinese side of the demilitarized zone, 50 to 70 meters into the area. In addition, at around 6:20 PM on September 25th, twenty-three U.S. armed personnel, carrying one light machine gun and eight carbines and other automatic weapons, as well as many hand grenades, entered the area near Gaewang-ri on the U.S. side of the demilitarized zone, which violated the agreement between the armistice parties that civilian police can only carry rifles and pistols.

The U.S. secretary attempted to evade discussion of the issues raised by the Korean-Chinese side in order to cover up the crimes of the U.S. side. The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side immediately pointed out this erroneous attitude of the U.S. side and demanded that the U.S. side conduct a thorough investigation of the U.S. side's violations of the armistice agreement and ensure that such incidents do not occur again in the future.

    在军事停战委员会秘书长会议上
    朝中方面抗议美方违反协定
    据新华社平壤9日电  朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝中方面秘书长在今天举行的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上就美方最近一系列违反停战协定的事件向美方提出抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出下列事实，9月20日八时二十五分左右，美方武装人员五名在美方地区马鸣洞附近向朝中方面地区进行侦察，并向在军事分界线以北一百米左右进行正常巡逻的朝中方面民政警察突然用步枪射击了九发子弹。9月11日十时十分左右，美方武装人员七名越过军事分界线，违反停战协定侵入非军事区朝中方面部分五十米—七十米处。另外，9月25日十八时二十分左右，美方武装人员二十三名携带着轻机关枪一挺和卡宾枪八支等自动武器和许多手榴弹，进入了非军事区美方部分的高旺里附近，这违反了停战双方关于民政警察只能携带步枪和手枪的协议。
    美方秘书长企图回避讨论朝中方面提出的问题，以掩盖美方的罪行。朝中方面秘书长当即指出了美方的这种错误态度，要求美方对美方违反停战协定的事件进行彻底的调查，保证今后不再发生此类事件。
