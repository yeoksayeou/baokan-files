    Zhang Jun, Vanguard of the Technical Revolution

    In March of this year, exciting news came from the Guizhou Automobile Parts Factory: "The woodworking workshop has completely broken away from manual operation and achieved mechanization!" This news spread quickly throughout Guizhou Province, talked about and praised everywhere, becoming a tremendous force for promoting work.

    A woodworking workshop was thoroughly transformed, with the rumble of rotating machines replacing the old saws, axes, and planes, allowing the carpenters to operate machines like mechanical workers, no longer having to bend over and hunch their backs year after year, while work efficiency increased rapidly by tenfold or a hundredfold—what a great change!

    The achievement of all this is inseparable from the hard work of Comrade Zhang Jun, a Communist Party member and carpenter.

      Dare to Think, Dare to Do, Courage a Hundredfold

    Zhang Jun was born into an extremely poor family. Due to the hardships of life, he fled from Sichuan to Guiyang with his father when he was a child. His father was a skilled carpenter, but in the old society, good craftsmanship was useless. Although the family did not have many members, they often did not know where their next meal would come from, and they did not have warm clothes. As a child, he herded cattle, planted vegetables, and carried coal for others. At the age of fourteen, he began to learn carpentry from his father. Four years later, unable to withstand the torment of a cruel life, his father passed away, leaving behind his entire family. At the age of eighteen, Zhang Jun, filled with grief, inherited his father's entire legacy—saws, axes, and planes—and embarked on the path his father had walked, carrying the burden of life. In 1944, in order to escape the Kuomintang reactionaries' conscription, Zhang Jun relied on his skills to enter the pseudo-Guizhou Highway Bureau Automobile Repair Factory. Here, he worked day and night like a beast of burden, and the wages he received were only enough for him to eat.

    In the old society, Zhang Jun, like other working people, suffered the bullying and exploitation of the ruling class. His heart was filled with hatred.

    In November 1949, Guiyang was liberated! Liberation brought him everything, freeing him from his shackles and giving him freedom and happiness. For the first time, he worked tirelessly for himself and for the motherland. Under the education of the Party, his awareness gradually increased, and the pride of being a master of his own destiny encouraged and inspired him. In his work, his enthusiasm grew stronger and stronger.

    In August 1950, the Party called on workers to step up the repair of scrapped vehicles and use practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army in completely eliminating the Kuomintang reactionaries. At the mention of eliminating the reactionaries, Zhang Jun felt full of energy and wished he could immediately repair all the scrapped vehicles. However, at that time, the car body workshop of the repair factory only had one wood planer, which could not meet the needs. Manual operation, no matter how fast, could not be very fast. At that time, Zhang Jun thought: How great it would be to have another machine like this! Therefore, the idea of ​​manufacturing a machine kept churning in his mind. One day, while he was operating the machine, the factory director led an engineer to the machine, pointed to the machine and said to the engineer: "I hope you can imitate this one, is it possible?" The engineer put on a nonchalant expression and said coldly, "That's not possible! This is an American product, we can't imitate it!" When Zhang Jun heard this, he was extremely angry. He thought, "So what if it's American! Aren't American machines also made by workers? You say you can't do it, but I will make one for you to see!"

    Although he said that, actually doing it was full of difficulties. An ordinary carpenter who only knew a hundred or so characters, making such a complex machine, how easy would it be! Moreover, if it was not successful, wouldn't he be ridiculed? These thoughts kept turning in Zhang Jun's mind.

    That day after work, he returned home in a bad mood and had no appetite for dinner. His wife, Wang Shuxian, brought the food, Zhang Jun picked up the bowl and couldn't help but think of the past life, those miserable, painful lives. He was deeply lost in thought.

    "Without the Communist Party, where would we be today? Now, the Party requires us to quickly repair the scrapped vehicles. If I don't work hard, how can I be worthy of the Party? If I don't do it, who will?" Thinking like this, he felt more and more that being discouraged was very wrong. As soon as he had confidence, his enthusiasm increased. He put down the bowl and said loudly, "Do it! I will resolutely do it!"

    From then on, Zhang Jun became busy. When others got off work and went home, he seemed to be obsessed, circling around the planer, comparing, measuring, painstakingly recording, and writing, until very late before returning home. Back at home, he threw down his bowl, and began drawing, cutting, pondering, and racking his brains, working until late at night every day before he could sleep. In this way, after his painstaking thinking and countless days and nights, three months passed, and the cardboard parts were finally cut out. However, even more arduous work was still to come. Turning the cardboard parts into wooden, iron, and steel parts would take even more effort and face even more difficulties. How much effort would this worker, who did not know many characters and did not understand the principles of machine manufacturing at all, have to spend to make each part, and how many times would he have to repeat it! But despite the difficulties one after another, he still persisted, persisted, and one by one the parts were made from his hands.

    "May 1st" International Labor Day was approaching. Zhang Jun was determined to make this planer as a gift to "May 1st". Therefore, his work became even more intense. On April 28, only three days away from "May 1st", the other parts had been installed, but he had not yet figured out how to make the four blades. After work that day, he rushed to some machine repair factories to consult with old blacksmiths. The old blacksmiths enthusiastically told him how to forge the blades, and how to quench them after forging. That night, he picked up the hammer and worked clang, clang, clang all night long, finally installing the planer.

    The next day, when the machine was pulled into the workshop, the whole factory was in an uproar. Everyone cheered and congratulated him. When the machine was tested, the four blades rotated rapidly, and the blades were also equipped with protective covers. It was faster, better, and safer than the American-made planer, which only had three blades and no safety equipment!

    With a sense of responsibility for work, with love for the Party, and with the perseverance of the working class, Zhang Jun, an ordinary carpenter who barely knew how to read, finally overcame numerous difficulties and made a planer that engineers did not dare to imitate, and surpassed the American-made product! This requires so much courage, such a high style!

    When trial-producing the planer, the problem of materials made Zhang Jun very worried. After completing the design, he had to immediately use wood, iron, and steel to manufacture the parts. However, where would these many materials come from? Because it was the first trial production, he himself was not sure whether it would be completely successful. If he reached out to the leadership for money to buy materials, it would certainly be very convenient, but what if it failed? Wouldn't that be wasting state property? Thinking this way, he made up his mind: not to ask the leadership for a penny, but to find a way to solve it himself! At this time, he thought of selling the two pigs at home.

    He discussed it with his wife, talking about the purpose of making the machine, Wang Shuxian had nothing to say. The Party had rescued their family from the fire pit, now, for the sake of work, could they not even bear to part with a few piglets? She nodded silently and agreed!

    However, when Zhang Jun sold the pigs and carried a load of materials home, Wang Shuxian noticed that her husband still had something on his mind. She immediately guessed why, and blurted out: "Is the money still not enough?"

    Zhang Jun thought for a moment, the worried look on his face suddenly cleared, bright eyes flashed with optimism, and he said with a smile: "It doesn't matter, I have a way!" He cheerfully unbuttoned his coat, pulled his new woolen sweater, and said humorously: "Well, just sell it off, anyway, it is a 'Liberation Brand', I never had such luxury before Liberation."

    Wang Shuxian looked at her husband lovingly and said nothing.

    In this way, Zhang Jun, this worker who was oppressed and enslaved before Liberation, this worker who did not consider his own gains or losses for the sake of the Party's cause, sold his beloved and precious things, bought enough of the materials he needed, and trial-produced the first machine.

      Overcome Difficulties and Continue to Leap Forward

    In November 1952, Zhang Jun joined the Communist Party, and a new page began in his life history. He further realized that engaging in technical innovation was not just to repay the Party's kindness, but for the more lofty and great cause of the Party. He made even stricter demands on himself, and his pace of progress became even faster. He made a new vow: According to the Party's instructions, he would use all his energy and wisdom to transform the backward manual woodworking workshop into machine operation, so that socialism and communism could be realized as soon as possible!

    The lofty ideals and great goals further inspired him, his energy became more and more vigorous, and his enthusiasm became more and more sufficient. If he had an American machine to imitate when he made the planer, then the large sawing machine was entirely his creation. From 1953, he used all his spare time to design this machine. The difficulties he encountered in the middle were too many to even remember. Not to mention anything else, just calculating the speed of the machine made him so distressed that he couldn't sleep for several nights. Someone who has studied machine manufacturing or mathematics may not have a problem with calculating the speed, but for this ordinary carpenter, it was another matter. At that time, he did not know how many revolutions per minute a motor of what size, a flywheel of what size should turn? He only had a simple idea: "Making machines is for speed, speed can produce more, and of course the faster the speed the better." So, he found a large flywheel weighing more than 100 kilograms and a large motor and installed them on the already formed sawing machine. Who knew that as soon as the power was turned on, the machine was so fast that the workers did not dare to approach it, and it idled loudly. Everyone just stared at it blankly. Zhang Jun held his breath, took a piece of wood to try it, but because the machine vibrated too violently, the wood could not hold up - it failed!

    However, he did not know at that time that the problem was that the speed was too fast. He modified other parts again and again, but failed every time. On the day of the fourteenth failure, he stared blankly at the large sawing machine that he could not do anything about, feeling that he had reached a dead end. At this moment, the Party gave him strength and confidence. The secretary of the Party branch of the workshop encouraged him, comforted him, and asked him to study with the engineer. Under the help and support of the Party organization, Zhang Jun regained his courage and conducted research together with the engineer. As a result, he found that the problem was that the speed was too fast. To slow down the speed, you only need to make the belt pulley smaller. Finding the key to solving the problem, Zhang Jun felt a stone fall from his heart.

    That night, he and Master Wang Desheng modified the belt pulley together. The two were inspired by the imminent success and forgot everything around them. They were working happily when the factory director appeared in their workshop and told them with concern: "It's already one o'clock, go back to sleep!"

    They replied: "It doesn't matter if we sleep a little later. Tomorrow is National Day, let's just finish it and give a gift to National Day."

    No matter what Zhang Jun said, the factory director forced them to go back to rest. Seeing that he could not resist, Zhang Jun winked at Wang Desheng, turned off the lights in the workshop, and walked towards the factory gate together. But when the factory director turned around and returned to the dormitory, they went back to the workshop to work like playing hide-and-seek. …

    The next day, at four o'clock on the morning of National Day, the large sawing machine was finally made. When Zhang Jun went home in the dawn, he thought, "If it weren't for the Party's encouragement and support, and for pointing out the direction for me, maybe I would still be failing, still be distressed! Party! With you, what difficulties cannot be overcome!"

    Yes, when he encountered difficulties, it was the Party that helped him overcome them; when he encountered some people with backward ideas who ridiculed and mocked him, it was the Party that criticized those backward ideas among the masses, promoted the spirit of innovation, and gave him warmth and strength, filling him with confidence; when he achieved results and felt a little complacent, it was the Party that gave him kind guidance, asking him to be vigilant against the budding complacency; when he felt that one person was weak and powerless, it was also the Party that mobilized other comrades, even other workshops, to help him. Just as he often said: Without the Party, how could all the achievements be possible!

    Flowers of Innovation Bloom All Over the Workshop

    In 1955, Zhang Jun attended the first National Labor Model Representative Conference for Highways, where he met Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao's teachings: "Modesty makes one progress, pride makes one lag behind." "Unite the masses, create more new achievements for socialist construction, and always maintain glory." These valuable golden words kept echoing in his mind. He silently thought: From 1951 to 1955, I only made four machines, an average of one machine a year. At such a slow speed, when will our woodworking workshop realize mechanization? No! I must go back and learn from other people's advanced experience and establish a rationalization proposal research group to let everyone use their brains.

    After Zhang Jun returned to the factory, with the support and help of the factory Party committee, the rationalization proposal research group was established. Engineers, technicians, and old workers all participated in this group. The workers also said to him enthusiastically: "Master Zhang, you just need to use your brains more and make suggestions, we have everything you need. How to make the machine, just say a word, we will do it!"…

    Zhang Jun once again felt the Party's and the masses' earnest expectations of him. He felt that he had no right to waste a minute, but should work harder and quickly change the face of the entire woodworking workshop. From then on, whether it was the cold winter or the scorching summer, every night, he either greedily studied culture, delved into technology, or drew sketches and made machines until late at night. The lively weekend party could not attract him, and the entanglement of his beloved children could not affect him. He did this day after day, night after night. … In this way, design sketches flew from his hands to the rationalization proposal research group, and new machines were manufactured with the help of the workers and put into production. From 1956 to 1957, seven machines were created and put into production.

    In the spring of 1958, the bugle of the Great Leap Forward sounded, which gave Zhang Jun even greater encouragement. "Catch up with Britain in fifteen years," he enthusiastically publicized to everyone he met. And he enthusiastically worked with the workers to calculate the details and tap the potential, combining the ideal of realizing the mechanization of the woodworking workshop with the Leap Forward plan. Wherever the weak link in production was, the machine created by Zhang Jun would appear first. On March 16, 1959, the drilling machine was born. As a result, the last manual operation in the woodworking workshop - drilling holes, was also replaced by machines. In addition to a planer left over from before Liberation and a new planer bought after Liberation, the remaining seventeen machines in the entire workshop were created jointly by Comrade Zhang Jun and the masses. These machines increased work efficiency by one time, twenty times, and one hundred and twenty times. For the main product, automobile cargo boxes alone, 32,000 man-hours could be saved in 1959 alone.

    The entire woodworking workshop announced that it had entered a new era.

    Advancing Together, Flying Side by Side

    Zhang Jun not only worked hard on his own, but also led and helped the comrades around him to engage in innovation together. Because he knew that only by constantly expanding the ranks of advanced workers could he better build socialism. He was always as kind as a relative to those young people who were diligent in learning and asking questions. Once, Xu Jianheng, a young worker from the painting group, came to him and said: "Master Zhang, I always think it is too laborious to mix the ash, I want to make a machine, but I am afraid it won't work, what do you say?" Zhang Jun said: "That's right! You should get a machine, be bolder, I will help you use your brain." So, with his help, Xu Jianheng finally made an ash mixer, which increased work efficiency seven times. Later, Xu Jianheng was also rated as an advanced producer, and Zhang Jun was as happy as he was when he was rated as a model worker.

    Zhang Jun not only cared about the affairs of the workshop and the factory at all times, but also about the outside affairs, as long as it was related to production and national construction, he cared about everything. In 1955, when he was recuperating in Beidaihe, once, Tan Fuji, a national first-class labor model for highways, gave a performance of mixing mud and sand, and Zhang Jun also rushed to visit. What he saw was a method of fifteen people replacing seventeen people to mix mud and sand. These northern men were all sweating profusely. Zhang Jun thought: This method is so laborious for big guys, wouldn't it be even more unbearable for small guys? It should still be done with machines. At that time, he thought about it every day by the beach, drawing lines in the sand, and rushed to trial-produce it as soon as he returned to the factory. After one or two months, he failed more than ten times. Sometimes he also had a thought that occasionally flashed through his mind: Forget it! This is none of our business! But he immediately blamed himself: How can it be said that it is none of our business? Not to mention that highways and automobiles are closely related, even if there is really no relationship, it is also the Party's cause, the working class's cause! We still have to do it! At this time, the Party committee also strongly supported this creation. After another ten days and nights of hard work, it was finally made successfully. The Highway Bureau immediately made two hundred units according to the model.

    The power plant wanted to make a gantry planer on its own, and he went to support it; cutting vegetables in the kitchen was laborious and inefficient, so he took time out of his rest to study and manufacture a vegetable cutting machine, which improved work efficiency and reduced the labor intensity of the cooks.

    Someone joked: Old Zhang is really nosy, what are you, a carpenter or what? Yes, in the broad mind of this Communist Party member, people's representative, and labor model, what is the difference between "your business" and "my business"! In his heart, there is only the Party's cause, the cause of the country's socialist construction. As long as he sees it, as long as he can do it, everything is his business.

    Comrade Zhang Jun, with his diligent and hard-working, modest and easy-going style, and with the achievements he has constantly made through continuous progress, has won people's love. He is the most popular person, and there is a constant stream of visitors to his room, from the Party branch secretary to the new apprentices who have just entered the factory.

    However, there are also two people who are very troubled by him. These are his wife and the doctor in the factory. His wife saw him thinking hard all day long, holding the bowl to his mouth, but forgetting to eat; waking up in the middle of the night, she still saw him crawling on the table gesturing. When an innovation was successful, before he could even catch his breath, a new reform came again. The doctor was troubled by the fact that according to his physical condition, overwork might cause his blood pressure to rise, so he often forbade him from staying up late, sometimes forcing him into the room: "You must rest for half a day!" Zhang Jun said: "Okay." But as soon as he turned around, he slipped out again. When forced again, he said: "Don't make a fuss, I know my own body. How can I sleep if the work is not finished? Get up early and do it, so as not to get sick." What can the doctor do with such a person? ×××

    Comrade Zhang Jun, an excellent soldier of the Party and a technical revolution pacesetter in Guizhou Province, follows the Party's teachings, closely connects with the masses, and for ten years, with selfless labor enthusiasm and tenacious spirit of research, has overcome countless difficulties and spent countless sleepless nights. But he is hardworking and conscientious, and never boasts of his merits or becomes arrogant. He often humbly says: "My small achievements are inseparable from the Party's education and the help of comrades. The achievements should be attributed to the Party and to the masses. I have only done my part. In the future, I will learn more modestly from everyone and make greater achievements. I will contribute all my strength to socialist construction!" Now, in order to better serve the cause of socialist construction, he has been learning lathe technology since September, developing into a "versatile" and helping the lathe workshop to carry out technical innovations.

    Zhang Jun is a red flag that everyone loves and respects.

专栏：

    技术革命的闯将张俊
    今年3月间，贵州汽车配件厂传出了一个振奋人心的消息：“木工车间全部摆脱了手工操作，实现了机械化！”这消息飞快地传遍了贵州全省，到处被人们谈论着、赞扬着，成为推动工作的巨大力量。
    使一个木工车间彻底地改变了落后面貌，隆隆旋转着的机器代替了那些陈旧的锯子、斧子和刨子，让木工们像机械工人一样操纵着机器，不必终年累月地弯着腰、驼着背，而工作效率成十倍、成百倍地向上飞速提高——这变化是多么大啊！
    这一切成就的取得，都是和共产党员、木工张俊同志的辛勤劳动分不开的。
      敢想敢做勇气百倍
    张俊出身在一个极贫苦的家庭里。由于生活的逼迫，小时随着父亲从四川逃难到了贵阳。父亲是个手艺很好的木工，但在旧社会，手艺再好也没有用。家里虽然人口不多，但经常是吃了上顿没下顿，脱了棉衣没单衣。他小时给人家放过牛、种过菜、挑过煤炭。十四岁起他跟父亲学手艺。四年后，经不住残酷生活的折磨，他的父亲就丢下全家去世了。十八岁的张俊满怀悲痛，继承了父亲留下的全部遗产——锯子、斧子和刨子，艰难地踏上了父亲走过的道路，挑起了生活的重担。1944年，为了逃避国民党反动派抓兵，张俊凭着手艺考进了伪贵州公路局汽车修理厂。在这里，他像牛马一样地日夜干活，所得的工资仅够他一个人吃饭。
    在旧社会，张俊和其他劳动人民一样受尽了统治阶级的欺凌和压榨。在他的心头聚积了满腔仇恨。
    1949年11月，贵阳解放了！解放给他带来了一切，使他挣脱了身上的枷锁，获得了自由和幸福。他第一次不知疲倦地为自己、为祖国辛勤地劳动。在党的教育下，他的觉悟逐渐提高，主人翁的自豪感鼓舞着他、激励着他，在工作上，他的劲头愈来愈大。
    1950年8月，党号召工人加紧修复报废的汽车，用实际行动支援解放军彻底消灭国民党反动派。一说消灭反动派，张俊混身是劲，恨不得马上把报废的车子都修好。但是，那时修理厂的车身车间只有一台刨木机，不能满足需要。凭手工操作，再快也快不了多少。当时张俊想：要是再有这样一部机器该多好啊！于是，制造机器的念头老是在他脑子里翻腾着。有一天，他正在机器上操作，厂长领着一个工程师走到机器旁边，指着机器对工程师说：“希望你照这个样仿制一部，行吗？”工程师摆出一副不以为然的神气，冷冷地说：“那不行！这是美国货，我们没法仿制！”张俊在旁一听这话，气得不得了。他想：“美国又怎么样！美国的机器还不也是工人造出来的？你说不能做，我倒要做一部给你看看！”
    话虽这么说，但是真要做起来，困难一大堆。一个普通的木工，字才认得百把个，要做这样复杂的机器，谈何容易！而且，如果做不成功，岂不是被人家耻笑？这些念头，在张俊脑中翻来复去地转个不停。
    这一天下班以后，他闷闷不乐地回到家里，吃饭也没有心思。他的爱人王淑仙端来了饭菜，张俊拿起碗，不由得想起过去的生活，那些悲惨的、痛苦的生活。他深深地陷在沉思里。
    “没有共产党，那里会有今天？现在，党要求我们赶快修复报废的车子，我不努力，对得起党吗？我不干谁来干？”这样一想，他越来越觉得灰心丧气是太不应该了。信心一来，劲头就大。他把碗一放，高声地说：“做！我坚决做！”
    从此以后，张俊就忙起来了。别人下班回家，他却像着了迷似的，围着那台刨木机转来转去，比着、量着，吃力地记着、写着，直到很晚才回家。回到家里，把饭碗一丢，又是画呀、剪呀，琢磨来琢磨去，天天搞到深更半夜才能睡觉。就这样，经过他的苦思苦想，熬过无数个日日夜夜，三个月过去了，纸壳子的零件终于都剪成了。但是，更艰巨的工作还在后面，把纸壳的零件变成木的、铁的和钢的零件，费的工夫还要大，困难还要多。这个识字不多、根本不懂得机器制造原理的工人，每做一个零件，不知要费多少心血，也不知要反复多少次啊！但是尽管困难一个接着一个，他还是坚持着，坚持着，从他手里一个又一个的零件制出来了。
    “五一”国际劳动节就要到了。张俊决心要把这台刨木机做好，作为向“五一”的献礼。于是，他的工作更紧张起来。4月28日，离“五一”只有三天，其他的零件都已经装好，可是四块刀片应该怎么做，他还没有想出一个结果。这天下班后，他又匆匆忙忙地跑到一些机修厂里去请教老锻工。老锻工们热情地把刀子怎样锻、锻了以后怎样淬火等都告诉了他。这天晚上，他拿起鎯头叮叮当当地直干了一个通宵，终于最后装成了刨木机。
    第二天，机器一拉到车间，全厂都轰动了，大家欢呼着，都向他祝贺。试车时，四块刀片飞快地旋转着，刀片上还装有防护罩，又快又好又安全，比美国制的那台只有三块刀片、而且没有安全设备的刨木机要好得多了！
    凭着对工作的责任感，凭着对党的热爱，凭着工人阶级的毅力，张俊，一个粗识文字的普通木工，终于克服了重重困难，制成了工程师所不敢仿制的刨木机，而且超过了美国制造的产品！这需要多么大的气魄、多么高的风格啊！
    在试制刨木机的时候，材料的问题使张俊很伤脑筋。他完成了设计以后，必须马上用木料、钢铁来制造零件。但是，这许多材料从那里来呢？因为是第一次试制，他自己也不敢保险能完全成功。如果伸手向领导上要钱买材料，那当然很方便，可是万一失败了呢？岂不是浪费了国家的财产，这样一想，他就下定决心：不向领导上要一分钱，自己想办法解决！这时他想起了变卖家里的两头猪。
    他同妻子一商量，说起了做机器的目的，王淑仙也没有什么好说的。党把自己一家人从火坑里救出来，现在，为了工作，难道连几头小猪也舍不得吗？她默默地点点头，同意了！
    可是，当张俊卖了猪，挑着一担材料回家时，王淑仙又从丈夫的眼里发现他还有什么心事。她立刻猜到是为什么，不觉脱口问道：“钱还不够吗？”
    张俊想了一下，忧愁的脸色豁然开朗了，明亮的眼睛里闪出乐观的神色，笑着说：“不要紧，我有办法！”他痛快地解开外衣，拉拉新的毛线衣，诙谐地说：“呶，干脆把它也卖掉，反正它是‘解放牌’的，解放前我也没有开过这样的洋荤。”
    王淑仙爱怜地看了看丈夫，什么也没有说。
    就这样，张俊，这个解放前被压迫、被奴役的工人，这个为了党的事业毫不考虑自己得失的工人卖掉了自己十分心爱的、珍贵的东西，买足了所需要的材料，试制成第一台机器。
      克服困难继续跃进
    1952年11月，张俊加入了共产党，在他的生命史上开始了新的一页。他进一步认识到，大闹技术革新不只是为了报答党的恩情，而是为了更崇高伟大的党的事业。他对自己的要求更加严格，前进的步伐也更加迅速了。他立下了新的誓愿：按照党的指示，要用全部精力和智慧，把落后的手工操作的木工车间全部改造成为机器操作，让社会主义、共产主义早日实现！
    崇高的理想和伟大的目标进一步鼓舞着他，他的精力愈来愈旺盛，干劲愈来愈足。如果说他制造刨木机还有一台美国机器做样子，那么，大型锯木机却完全是他的创造。从1953年开始，他全部的业余时间都用来设计这部机器。在这中间所碰到的困难，多得连他自己也记不清。别的不说，单是计算机器的转速，就使他苦恼得几夜不能入睡。一个学过机器制造或者数学的人，对计算转速也许不成问题，可是对这个普通的木工来说，那又是另一回事了。他当时那里知道多大的马达、多大的飞轮一分钟应该转好多转呢？他只有一个简单的想法：“做机器嘛，就是为了快，快就能多生产，速度当然是越快越好。”于是，他找了一个一百多斤重的大飞轮、一个大马达，安在已经成型的锯木机上。谁知一开电门，机器快得工人都不敢挨边，轰隆隆地空转着，大家看着它干瞪眼。张俊自己别住一股劲，拿了块木板去一试，由于机器震动得太厉害，木板搁不住，——失败了！
    但是他当时并不知道毛病是转速太快，他一次又一次地改动其他的零件，但每一次都失败了。在第十四次失败的那一天，他呆呆地看着那台奈何不得的大型锯木机，感到走投无路。正在这时候，党给了他力量，给了他信心。车间党支部书记鼓励了他，安慰了他，并且叫他和工程师去研究一下。张俊在党组织的帮助、支持下，重新又鼓起了勇气，找工程师共同进行研究，结果发现毛病就是由于速度太快。要速度放慢，只要把皮带盘改小就可以了。找到了解决问题的关键，张俊心里放下了一块石头。
    当天晚上，他就和王德生老师傅一起改装皮带盘。两个人被即将到来的成功鼓舞着，忘记了周围的一切。他们干得正高兴，厂长出现在他们的车间里，关心地叫他们：“已经一点钟了，快回去睡觉吧！”
    他们回答说：“迟睡一会也不要紧。明天是国庆节，干脆把它搞成，给国庆节献礼。”
    不管张俊怎么说，厂长还是逼着他们回去休息。张俊一看拗不过，便对王德生使了一个眼色，关了车间的灯，一齐朝厂门口走去。但是当厂长转身回宿舍以后，他们又像捉迷藏似的，回到车间干起活来。……
    第二天，国庆节清晨四点钟，大型锯木机终于制成了。当张俊趁着黎明的曙光回家的时候，他想，“如果不是党的鼓舞和支持，并且给我指明了方向，说不定我现在还是失败，还是苦恼呢！党啊！有了你，什么困难不能克服呢！”
    是的，在他碰到困难的时候，是党帮助他克服了困难；在他遇到了某些有落后思想的人对他讽刺、奚落的时候，是党在群众中批判了那些落后思想，伸张了革新的精神，给了他温暖和力量，使他充满了信心；在他取得了成绩，感到有些自满的时候，是党给了他亲切的教导，要他警惕刚萌芽的自满情绪；当他感到一个人势单力薄的时候，也是党发动其他同志，甚至其他车间来帮助他。正像他自己经常所说的：一切的成就，离开了党，那怎么可能呢！
    革新之花开遍车间
    1955年，张俊出席了全国公路第一次劳动模范代表大会，他在北京见到了全国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席。毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”“团结群众，为社会主义建设创造出更多的新成绩，永远保持光荣。”这些宝贵的金玉良言，不断在他脑子里回旋。他默默地想：从1951年到1955年，自己只做了四部机器，平均一年才一部，像这样慢的速度，我们木工车间什么时候才能实现机械化呢？不行！回去一定要学习别人的先进经验，成立合理化建议研究小组，让大家都来动脑筋。
    张俊回厂以后，在厂党委的支持和帮助下，合理化建议研究小组成立了。工程师、技术员、老工人都参加这个小组。工人们也热情地对他说：“张师傅，你只管多动脑筋提建议好了，要什么有什么。机器怎么做，只要你说一声，我们来干！”……
    张俊又一次感到党和群众对自己的殷切期望。他觉得自己没有权利浪费一分钟，而应该更艰苦地工作，迅速改变整个木工车间的面貌。从此以后，不管是寒风凛冽的冬季，还是赤日炎炎的夏天，每一个晚上，他不是贪婪地学习着文化，钻研着技术，就是绘草图、做机器，直到深夜。热闹的周末晚会吸引不了他，心爱的儿女纠缠影响不了他。他日日如此，夜夜如此。……这样，一张张的设计草图从他手里飞到了合理化建议研究小组，一台台的新机器在工人们的协助下制成投入生产。1956年到1957年，创造投入生产的机器就有七台。
    1958年春天，大跃进的号角吹响了，这给张俊以更大的鼓舞。“十五年就要赶上英国”，他逢人就兴高采烈地宣传。并且热情地和工人们算细账挖潜力，把实现木工车间机械化的理想和跃进计划结合起来。哪里是生产的薄弱环节，哪里便最先出现张俊创造的机器。1959年3月16日，打眼机诞生了。于是，木工车间最后的一项手工操作——打眼子，也用机器来代替了。全车间除了解放前留下来的一台刨木机和解放后买的一台夹新刨以外，其余十七台机器都是张俊同志和群众共同创造的。这些机器使工效提高了一倍、二十倍到一百二十倍。单主要产品汽车货箱一项，1959年一年就可以节约工时三万二千个。
    整个木工车间宣布走上了一个新时代。
    共同前进比翼齐飞
    张俊不单是自己苦钻苦干，还带动、帮助周围的同志一道搞革新。因为他知道：只有使先进工人的队伍不断地壮大，才能更好地建设社会主义。对那些勤学好问的年青人，他总是像亲人一样的亲切。有一次，油漆组的青工徐建恒找他说：“张师傅，我总嫌调灰太费力了，想搞架机器吧，又怕调不转，你说呢？”张俊说：“想得对！该要个机器，胆子大点，我帮着你动脑筋。”于是，在他的帮助下，徐建恒终于制成了调灰器，提高了工效七倍。后来徐建恒也被评为先进生产者，张俊就像自己被评为模范时那样高兴。
    张俊不但对车间、本厂的事时刻关心，就是外面的事，只要关系着生产，关系着国家建设，什么事他都管。1955年，他在北戴河休养时，有一次，全国公路一等劳动模范谭富基作拌泥沙的表演，张俊也赶去参观了。他看到的是十五个人代替十七个人拌泥沙的方法，这些北方大汉，个个累得汗流浃背。张俊想：这办法大个子都这么费力，个子小的不是更吃不消了？还是应该用机器。他当时就天天在海边沙滩上划来划去的想，一回厂就赶着试制。搞了一、二个月，十几次都失败了。有时他也有一个思想偶然掠过：算了吧！这又不关我们的事！但他马上又责备自己：怎么叫做不关我们的事？不要说公路和汽车关系很密切，就是真没有什么关系，那也是党的事业、工人阶级的事业！还是要干！这时党委也大力支持了这个创造。又经过十几天没日没夜的苦战，终于制造成功了。公路局立即按样子做了两百台。
    动力厂要自制龙门刨床，他去支援；厨房切菜费力、效率不高，他就抽休息时间钻研、制造了一种切菜机，提高了工效，减轻了炊事员的劳动强度。
    有人开玩笑说：老张闲事真管得宽，你到底是木工还是什么？是啊，在这个共产党员、人民代表、劳动模范的宽阔的心胸里，有什么“你的事”、“我的事”之分呢！在他心里，只有党的事业，祖国社会主义建设的事业，只要他见到，只要他能办，什么都是他的事。
    张俊同志，以他勤恳苦干、谦逊平易的作风，以他不断进步取得的成绩，赢得了人们的爱戴。他是个最受人欢迎的人，在他的房间里经常来客不断，从党总支书记直到刚进厂的新学工。
    但是，也有两个人对他很感头痛。这就是他的爱人和厂里的医生。爱人看他一天到晚苦苦思索，碗端到嘴边，却忘扒饭；半夜醒来，还见他扒在桌上比比划划。等到一项革新成功了，一口气还没有松下来，新的改革又来了。医生头痛的是：根据他的体质判断，劳累过度可能会使血压升高，因此经常禁止他熬更守夜，有时把他逼到房里：“你一定要休息半天！”张俊说：“好吧。”可是一转身，他又溜出来了。再逼，他就说：“不用大惊小怪，自己的身体自己晓得。工作没搞完，睡得着吗？趁早起来搞搞，免得蹙出病来。”对这样的人，医生又有什么办法呢？×××
    党的优秀战士、贵州省的技术革命标兵张俊同志，遵循着党的教导，紧密地联系着群众，十年如一日，以忘我的劳动热情和顽强的钻研精神，战胜了无数困难，熬过了无数个不眠之夜。但他任劳任怨，从不夸功骄傲。他常常谦虚地说：“我的这些微小的成绩，都是和党的教育、同志们的帮助分不开的。成绩应该归功于党、归功于群众。我只不过尽了自己的一份力量。今后我要更虚心地向大家学习，做出更大的成绩。为社会主义建设贡献出全部力量！”现在，他为了能更好地为社会主义的建设事业服务，从9月份起又开始学习车工技术，向“多面手”发展，并帮助车工车间进行技术革新。
    张俊，是一面人人敬爱的红旗。
