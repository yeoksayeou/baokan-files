    The Most Vicious Capitalism
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Painting by Hua Junwu
    
    Report: The U.S. Army is spending billions of dollars to step up preparations for germ warfare and chemical warfare. Afraid of peaceful competition, they desperately cling to war. Day and night, they think about one thing: how to kill people quickly! The young masters in the army are unreliable; when it comes to rockets, they are not as good as others. God's blessing is a sham, so they can only rely on germs. Sending rats as marshals, calling lice generals, flying the flag of dysentery, the vanguard is a swarm of flies. Relapsing fever and anthrax, malaria and yellow fever, frantically cultivated in large quantities, the more poisonous, the more vicious, the better. Fearing human health, worrying about peace in homes. So-called human-faced beasts still have to give way to him by three points. Crimes on the Korean battlefield aroused global indignation. The ironclad evidence of the crimes is as solid as a mountain, and now the old habits are recurring! A dignified country has become a lesion, a boil! A snake pit, a wolf's den, a scorpion's hole, curled up inside to work! Capitalism is the source, the breeding ground for all evils. The most vicious capitalism! If we don't destroy it, it will be rampant!

    最毒资本主义
    袁水拍诗　华君武画
    报载：美国陆军花几十亿美元加紧准备细菌战和化学战。害怕和平竞赛，死活不忘战争。日思夜想一桩：怎样快速杀人！少爷兵，靠不住，论火箭，不及人。上帝保佑是假，只好指望细菌。派老鼠当元帅，叫虱子做将军，旗号打的痢疾，前锋是群苍蝇。回归热和炭疽，疟疾和黄热病，拼命大量培养，越毒越凶越行。唯恐人类健康，但愁家宅太平。所谓人面兽心，还得让他三分。朝鲜战场罪行，引起全球公愤，罪证铁案如山，而今故态复萌！堂堂一个国家，变成病灶、毒疮！蛇窟狼窝蝎洞，蜷在里头办公！资本主义是源，一切罪恶温床。最毒资本主义！不灭它，定猖狂！
