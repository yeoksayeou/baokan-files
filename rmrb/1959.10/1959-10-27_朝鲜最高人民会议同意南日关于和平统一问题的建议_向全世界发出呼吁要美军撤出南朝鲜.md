Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 26th: The Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opened in Pyongyang today.

    Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Choi Yong-kun, and Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, and other leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the government attended the meeting. A total of 201 deputies attended the meeting.

    At the morning session today, the four items on the agenda for this meeting were adopted: 1. On the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland; 2. On Reforming the People's Education System; 3. Ratification of the Decrees of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly; 4. By-elections for Deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly and Re-election of the President of the Supreme Court.

    Korean Deputy Premier Nam Il delivered a report on the first item on the agenda on behalf of the Cabinet at the morning session today.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 26th: The Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea unanimously approved this afternoon the proposal made by Deputy Premier and Deputy Nam Il at the morning session today, to write letters in the name of the current session of the Supreme People's Assembly to the South Korean National Assembly, the South Korean people, and the parliaments of all countries around the world regarding the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea.

    The meeting elected a drafting committee composed of 17 people, including Kim Chang-man and Hong Myung-hee, to draft these letters.

    At today's meeting, deputies Hong Myung-hee, Park Kim-chul, Kang Ryang-wook, Park Shin-duk, and Kim Chun-hae spoke, unanimously supporting Nam Il's report on the first item on the agenda and his proposals.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 26th: Deputy Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly, Nam Il, delivered a report on the peaceful reunification of the fatherland at the Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea this morning.

    Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, Nam Il proposed in his report that the current session of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly issue the following appeals to the South Korean authorities, the parliaments of all countries in the world, and people of all walks of life around the world.

    "The issue of Korean reunification must be discussed as an important international issue that cannot be delayed any longer at this current time. In order to promote the realization of North-South Korean reunification, the Korean armistice must be guided towards a consolidated peace. The United States and the Syngman Rhee authorities must immediately cease their brutal actions that violate the armistice agreement and the dangerous preparatory war provocations that attempt to turn South Korea into an atomic base."

    "The withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea is a prerequisite for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We request that the United States and the governments of other countries that have troops stationed in South Korea carefully consider the current situation in Korea and take relevant measures to immediately withdraw their troops. U.S. troops and the troops of other countries that participated in the Korean War no longer have any basis or reason to continue to be stationed in South Korea today. If the United States and other countries that sent their troops during the Korean War have no intention of interfering in our internal affairs and invading our country, then what reason do the troops of those countries have to remain here without leaving?"

    "We expect all people around the world who hope for the national unity of the Korean people and the consolidation of peace in Korea and Asia to give active support and solidarity to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea."

    "At the same time, we propose to first reduce the armies of North and South Korea to below 100,000 respectively in the shortest possible time. We also suggest to the South Korean authorities that the North and South Korean authorities solemnly declare that they will not use force against each other."

    "In light of the current world situation, where the tension in international relations has significantly eased due to the initiative of the Soviet Union and the issue of complete disarmament has been put on the agenda, such measures are even more realistic."

    "We propose that, after all foreign troops have completely withdrawn from South Korea, free elections for the whole of Korea be held within a certain period of time, under conditions that can fully guarantee the free will of the people of North and South Korea."

    "The time has come for representatives of North and South Korea to gather together and sincerely discuss the major issues of the state and the nation, including the issue of holding free elections throughout Korea. We advocate organizing a standing committee composed of representatives of the North and South Korean parliaments, governments, or political parties and social organizations."

    "Regardless of political views, knowledge, or beliefs, we can consult with anyone who truly hopes for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland at any time. We will join hands and advance together with anyone who is for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, regardless of who they are and without dwelling on the past."

    Establishing economic and cultural ties between North and South Korea is an urgent demand of the people of North and South Korea. We demand that the people of North and South Korea be allowed to freely visit each other and exchange letters, and to realize mutual exchanges in the economic, cultural, scientific, technological, sports, and other sectors. We suggest to the South Korean authorities and economic figures that a standing committee for North-South Korean economic development and exchange, composed of economic representatives from North and South Korea, be established first. This committee is unrelated to political issues and will discuss the connection and coordination of economic development between North and South Korea and the realization of economic exchanges between North and South Korea."

    Nam Il said, "The proposals we have put forward are the most realistic and only way to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland under the current conditions, and they reflect the unanimous desire of all Korean people who eagerly yearn for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland day and night. The South Korean authorities should not treat this proposal with insincerity as they have done in the past, but must treat it with caution, conduct in-depth consideration and discussion, and express a positive attitude. We are confident that all peace-loving people around the world will further actively support and stand in solidarity with our just policy of peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the consistent efforts made to realize it."

    Nam Il said in his report, "I propose that, based on the above proposals, letters be sent in the name of the current Supreme People's Assembly to the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and the South Korean people, and to the parliaments of all countries around the world."

    Nam Il emphasized that the unity of all national forces is of decisive significance in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. If all patriotic forces in North and South Korea unite and actively struggle, no obstacles can stop the reunification of our fatherland. All patriotic forces in North and South Korea must unite and bravely advance towards the final victory of the reunification of the fatherland.

    Before putting forward the above proposals, Nam Il first said in his report that the Korean people have spent fifteen years in the great misfortune and suffering caused by the division of the fatherland. The division of the fatherland not only hinders the political, economic, and cultural development of Korea, but also brings great suffering to the social and private lives of all Korean people. Therefore, striving for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland is the greatest national task of all Korean people, a burning desire that can never be forgotten.

    The report emphasized, "Today, with the new and profound changes in the domestic and international situation, the issue of ending the divided state of Korea and peacefully reunifying the fatherland has been raised as an urgent and pressing task."

    In his report, Nam Il compared the different and profound changes that have occurred in North and South Korea over these years. The report pointed out the current situation of complete bankruptcy of industry and agriculture in South Korea, cultural degeneration, and the extremely painful lives of the people. The report said that the current industrial production of pig iron, chemical fertilizers, and a series of important industrial sectors in South Korea has been completely destroyed. 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises have stopped production or reduced production. Grain production has decreased by 40% compared with the period of Japanese rule, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people reaches more than half of the able-bodied population, with millions of farmers suffering from food shortages. Under these circumstances, the anti-American and anti-Syngman Rhee momentum of the people from all walks of life in South Korea is further rising.

    The report said that South Korea is mired in such a dark and tragic situation because the U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee authorities are not engaged in peaceful construction, but are only concerned with strengthening military forces, placing a heavy military burden on the people.

    The report pointed out that the U.S. invading forces occupying South Korea have turned South Korea into its atomic and missile base and are intensifying their war cries, aggravating the tension in Korea, and constantly threatening the Korean armistice. The report said that the continued occupation of South Korea by the U.S. military and the continuation of the division of Korea are not only the root cause of the national misfortune and suffering of the Korean people, but also the main source of threats to the consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world.

    The report said that compared with the situation in South Korea, the solemn reality in northern Korea forms a sharp contrast. Under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, the people of northern Korea have entered a period of unprecedented prosperity and leap forward. The first Five-Year Plan's total industrial output value target has been completed two and a half years ahead of schedule, and after this year's production plan is completed, the industrial output value will reach more than seven times that of the pre-war period. Last year's grain output reached twice that of 1946. The actual wages of workers and staff have increased by 60% compared with 1949, and the lives of farmers have generally reached or exceeded the level of middle peasants.

    The report said that today the people of northern Korea ardently hope to use the fruits of their labor to relieve the people of South Korea who are struggling in misfortune, and regard this as a national obligation. However, this desire based on fraternal love cannot be realized. As a result, the people of South Korea cannot utilize the rich resources and everything needed for people's lives such as electricity, coal, fertilizer, and steel from northern Korea, but have to purchase them from across the Pacific Ocean. Construction sites in northern Korea, which are undergoing magnificent economic construction, need people at any time, but millions of unemployed people are wandering in the cities and villages of South Korea.

    The report emphasized, "What is the way out of all these misfortunes and disasters? There is only one way: to peacefully reunify the fatherland."

    The report went on to say that recently, the international situation has also undergone tremendous changes, and the ideal of peaceful consultation has become an irresistible trend of the times. The division of Korea is a product of the bankrupt "strength" policy, and it has become a hateful obstacle to the cause of peace. Whether from the national interests of the Korean people or from the perspective of striving for lasting world peace, the issue of unifying the divided Korea is an urgent and pressing issue that has matured.

    The report went on to describe the consistent efforts made by the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and consolidate peace in Korea, and condemned the actions of the United States and the Syngman Rhee group in obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea and exacerbating the tension in Korea.

    The report said that the occupation of South Korea by the U.S. invading forces is the biggest obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea. On February 5, 1958, the government of the Republic issued a statement, proposing to the relevant countries that all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, be withdrawn from Korea. According to this proposal, the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea. This has opened up a new situation for transforming the Korean armistice into a consolidated peace and promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea. The report said that a year has passed since the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea, but the U.S. invading forces have not withdrawn from South Korea. The U.S. military has no reason to continue to remain in Korea, and the Korean people will continue to wage a tenacious struggle to drive out the U.S. invading forces.

    The report emphasized that the divided state of Korea can no longer be ignored. It will bring even more dangerous consequences not only to the interests of the Korean people, but also to peace in the Far East and the world. All conscientious Koreans must not disregard the current situation and must rise up to fight for the cause of reunifying the fatherland. We must submit the current situation of the fatherland and the issues related to reunification to the just public opinion of the people all over the world for discussion.

    朝鲜最高人民会议同意南日关于和平统一问题的建议
    向全世界发出呼吁要美军撤出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第六次会议今天在平壤开幕。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成，最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健和金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满、郑一龙、南日等朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导人出席了会议。出席会议的议员共有二百零一名。
    在今天上午的会议上通过了这次会议的四项议程：一、关于祖国和平统一；二、关于改组人民教育体系；三、批准最高人民会议常任委员会的政令；四、补选最高人民会议议员和改选最高裁判所所长。
    朝鲜内阁副首相南日在今天上午的会议上代表内阁就第一项议程作了报告。
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第六次会议今天下午一致同意内阁副首相、议员南日在今天上午的会议上提出的以最高人民会议本次会议的名义就朝鲜的和平统一问题写信给南朝鲜国会、南朝鲜人民和世界各国国会的建议。
    会议选出了由金昌满、洪命熹等十七人组成的起草委员会来起草这些信。
    在今天的会议上，议员洪命熹、朴金喆、康良煜、朴信德、金天海等发了言，他们一致支持南日就会议的第一项议程所作的报告和他提出的建议。
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相、最高人民会议议员南日今天上午在朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第六次会议上，作了关于祖国的和平统一的报告。
    南日受朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和共和国政府的委托，在报告中建议朝鲜最高人民会议本次会议向南朝鲜当局、全世界各国国会和全世界各界人士提出如下的呼吁。
    “要把朝鲜的统一问题当做目前时期再不能拖延的重要的国际问题来进行讨论。为了促进实现南北朝鲜的统一，必须使朝鲜的停战导向巩固的和平。必须立即制止美国和李承晚当局的违反停战协定的粗暴行为和企图把南朝鲜变成原子基地的危险的准备战争的挑衅行为。”
    “从南朝鲜撤走一切外国军队是和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件。我们要求美国和派有自己的军队在南朝鲜的其他国家政府慎重考虑朝鲜的目前局势，并为了立即撤出自己的军队采取有关措施。美国军队和参加过朝鲜战争的其他国家的军队，今天再没有任何根据、任何理由继续驻在南朝鲜了。如果美国和在朝鲜战争派遣过自己军队的其他国家没有干涉我国内政和侵略我国的意图，那么，那些国家的军队还有什么理由继续留着不走呢？”
    “我们期待着希望朝鲜人民的民族统一以及朝鲜和亚洲的巩固和平的全世界一切人们，为了美国军队从朝鲜撤走给予积极的支持和声援。”
    “同时，我们建议首先在最短时期内把南北朝鲜的军队分别裁减到十万以下。我们还向南朝鲜当局建议，南北朝鲜当局严肃宣布互相不使用武力来反对对方。”
    “根据由于苏联的倡议使国际关系的紧张状态有显著缓和和关于彻底裁减军备的问题提到日程上来的目前世界局势来看，这种措施是更有现实意义的。”
    “我们建议，在一切外国军队从南朝鲜完全撤走后，在一定期间内，在能够完全保证南北朝鲜人民表示自由意志的条件下，实行全朝鲜的自由选举。
    为了讨论包括实行全朝鲜自由选举问题在内的有关和平统一国家的问题，南北朝鲜的代表聚集一堂，真挚地协商国家和民族大事的时机已经来到了。我们主张组织以南北朝鲜的国会、政府或各政党、社会团体的代表组成的常设委员会。”
    “我们不管政治见解、有无知识和信仰如何，只要他是真正希望祖国的和平统一的人，任何时候都能同他进行协商，只要是为祖国和平统一的人士，不管是谁，我们将不究既往同他一道携手前进。”
    建立南北朝鲜间的经济、文化联系，是南北朝鲜人民的迫切要求。我们要求南北朝鲜人民间自由地互相来往和书信来往，实现经济、文化科学、技术、体育和其他部门的互相交流。我们向南朝鲜当局和经济界人士建议，首先组织由南北朝鲜经济代表组成的南北朝鲜经济发展交流常设委员会。这个委员会同政治问题无关，它将协商联系和调整南北朝鲜的经济发展和关于实现南北朝鲜的经济交流问题。”
    南日说，“我们提出的这些方案，是在目前条件下能够促进祖国的和平统一的最现实的唯一的途径，它反映了一日千秋渴望祖国的和平统一的全体朝鲜人民的一致愿望。南朝鲜当局不要像从前那样毫无诚意对待这一建议，而必须慎重地对待，深刻地进行考虑和讨论后表示肯定的态度。我们确信全世界爱好和平的人民将进一步积极支持和声援我们和平统一祖国的正当方针和为其实现所作的一贯努力。”
    南日在报告中说，“我建议就以上建议，通过以本次最高人民会议的名义给大韩民国国会和南朝鲜人民的信，和给世界各国国会的信。”
    南日强调说，在争取和平统一祖国的斗争中有决定意义的是一切民族力量的团结一致。如果南北朝鲜一切爱国力量一致积极进行斗争，任何障碍也阻挡不住我们祖国的统一。南北朝鲜的一切爱国力量要一致团结起来，向祖国统一的最后胜利奋勇前进。
    在提出上述建议以前，南日在报告中首先说，朝鲜人民已在由于祖国分裂而造成的巨大不幸和痛苦中过了十五年。祖国的分裂不仅阻碍了朝鲜的政治、经济、文化的发展，而且给全体朝鲜人民的社会生活和私人生活带来了巨大的痛苦。因此，争取祖国的和平统一是全体朝鲜人民的最大的全民族的任务，是一刻也不能忘记的火热的愿望。
    报告强调说：“今天，随着国内外形势的新的深刻的变化，终止朝鲜的分裂状态和和平统一祖国的问题，作为刻不容缓的迫切任务被提出来了。”
    南日在报告中对比了南北朝鲜在这些年中发生的不同的深刻的变化。报告指出了目前南朝鲜工农业经济全面破产，文化堕落，人民生活十分痛苦的情景。报告说，南朝鲜目前的工业中生铁、化学肥料的生产和一系列重要工业部门已被破坏无余。中小企业有80％停了工或减少了生产。粮食产量比日本统治时期减产了40％，失业者和半失业者达到有劳动能力的人口的一半以上，断粮农民有数百万。在这种情况下，南朝鲜各界人民反美、反李承晚的气势更进一步高涨。
    报告说，南朝鲜陷于这种黑暗的悲惨局面，是由于美帝国主义和李承晚当局不进行和平建设，只顾增强军事力量，使人民负担沉重的军费。
    报告指出，强占南朝鲜的美国侵略军使南朝鲜变为它的原子和导弹基地并加紧进行战争叫嚣，加剧朝鲜的紧张状态，不断威胁朝鲜的停战。报告说，美军继续强占南朝鲜和朝鲜分裂的持续，不仅是朝鲜人民的民族不幸和痛苦的根源，而且也是远东和世界巩固和平受到威胁的主要祸根。
    报告说，同南朝鲜的情况相比，朝鲜北部的庄严的现实形成了鲜明的对照。朝鲜北部人民在劳动党和共和国政府的英明领导下，进入了史无前例的繁荣和跃进的时期。第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划已提前二年半完成，今年的生产计划完成以后，工业产值将达到战前的七倍以上。去年的粮食产量达到1946年的二倍。职工的实际工资比1949年增加了60％，农民生活全面达到中农以上的水平。
    报告说，今天朝鲜北部人民热烈希望以自己的劳动成果救济在不幸中挣扎的南朝鲜人民，并把这看做是民族的义务。但是从同胞友爱出发的这一愿望却不能实现。结果，南朝鲜人民不能利用朝鲜北部的丰富的资源和电力、煤炭、肥料、钢铁等人民生活需要的一切资材，却不得不到太平洋彼岸去购买。正在进行宏伟的经济建设的朝鲜北部的工地上，任何时候都需要人，但南朝鲜的城市和乡村中却有数百万失业者在徬徨。
    报告强调指出，“这一切的不幸和灾难的出路何在呢？那只有和平统一祖国这一条道路。”
    报告接着说，最近国际局势也发生了巨大的变化，和平协商的理想已经成为不可阻挡的时代潮流。朝鲜的分裂是已经破了产的“实力”政策的产物，它成为和平事业的可憎的障碍。无论从朝鲜人民的民族利益来看，或从争取持久的世界和平来看，统一分裂的朝鲜的问题是刻不容缓的、迫切的成熟了的问题。
    报告接着叙述了朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为和平解决朝鲜问题和巩固朝鲜的和平所进行的一贯努力，并且谴责了美国和李承晚集团阻挠朝鲜的和平统一、加剧朝鲜紧张局势的行为。
    报告说，美国侵略军强占着南朝鲜是和平统一朝鲜的最大障碍。1958年2月5日共和国政府发表声明，向有关国家提出了包括中国人民志愿军在内的一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的主张。根据这个建议，中国人民志愿军已从朝鲜完全撤走了。这为把朝鲜的停战转变为巩固和平、促进朝鲜的和平统一打开了新的局面。报告说，中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤走已经过了一年了，但美国侵略军还没有从南朝鲜撤走，美军没有任何理由继续留在朝鲜，朝鲜人民将继续为赶走美国侵略军进行顽强的斗争。
    报告强调说，再不能对朝鲜的分裂状态置之不问了，它不仅对朝鲜人民利益，而且将对远东和世界和平带来更加危险的后果。一切有良心的朝鲜人决不能漠视目前的局势，要为争取祖国统一的事业而起来斗争。我们要把祖国的目前局势和有关统一的问题交给全世界人民的公正舆论去进行讨论。
