    Adhering to Putting Politics in Command Enhances Teaching Quality
    Changchun No. 9 Middle School Implements the Party's Education Policy and Becomes an Advanced School in the City

    (Our dispatch) Changchun No. 9 Middle School in its teaching work, has strengthened leadership, adhered to putting politics in command, given full play to the leading role of teachers, and actively encouraged all teachers and students to have lofty aspirations and great ambitions, striving to catch up with the teaching level of advanced schools. The teaching quality has been significantly improved, and the school has established a new style of learning. In recent years, graduates have achieved excellent results in entrance examinations. In 1959, the number of junior middle school graduates who met the admission standards accounted for 98.8% of the total number of students taking the entrance examination, making it an advanced school in the city. Currently, the school is conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, reviewing and revising the school plan, continuing to exert great effort, striving for advancement, comprehensively and deeply implementing the Party's education policy, further improving teaching quality, and strengthening the construction of production labor bases, so that all aspects of the school's work can be improved further. They have put forward several specific measures: First, in terms of teaching, improve the teaching quality of the three major basic courses, while comprehensively improving the teaching quality of all subjects; second, carry out teaching research activities, summarize the school's teaching work over the years, and learn from the work experience of other advanced schools; third, require teachers to prepare lessons carefully, and the school frequently supervises and inspects teaching work, discovering problems and helping to solve them in a timely manner. In terms of production labor, preparations are being made to further improve the operation of factories, farms, and breeding farms, and to prepare for next year's production in the fourth quarter of this year.

    The educational practice of No. 9 Middle School over the past few years has proven that schools with poor conditions can improve teaching quality as long as they strengthen political and ideological education work and give full play to the leading role of teachers. No. 9 Middle School was a newly built school in 1954, and in many aspects such as teachers and teaching equipment, it was not as good as other middle schools in the city. Because the school was newly established, the teaching quality was relatively low. At that time, students looked down on the school and were not at ease studying; teachers were also not at ease teaching and requested transfers. These seriously hindered the implementation of the Party's education policy and affected the improvement of teaching quality. After a series of political movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the rectification campaign, on the basis of improving the teachers' political and ideological awareness and strengthening their dedication to the education cause, the school analyzed the ideological situation of teachers and students, and believed that having many young teachers was a good thing. They had high political enthusiasm and were willing to learn. As long as they adhered to putting politics in command, improved the teachers' professional level, and fully mobilized all positive factors, the teaching quality could be improved. In 1957, this school would produce its first graduates. From this academic year, the school Party organization seized the opportunity and promptly put forward a resounding slogan: teachers teach well, students learn well, catch up with the teaching level of advanced schools, cultivate high-quality talents for the motherland, and bring glory to the school. Under the call of the school Party organization, teachers and students all made plans to ensure that they taught well and learned well. All teachers and students were full of energy and confidence. Teachers actively studied and carefully prepared and taught lessons, strengthening extracurricular tutoring. Students also studied diligently, worked hard, loved labor. The whole school quickly presented a new style of hard study, active labor, diligent research, respect for teachers and love for students, unity and harmony.

    In its work, No. 9 Middle School, based on the specific situation of the school, prominently did the following aspects of work.

    Under the premise of putting politics in command, first pay attention to improving teachers' cultural level and professional ability. School leaders actively organize teachers to participate in correspondence courses offered by Changchun Municipal College of Further Education and Jilin Normal University, and ensure teachers' study time. Because teachers insist on self-study, the school actively helps teachers arrange study time. In recent years, teachers' knowledge level has been significantly improved. Thirteen teachers who originally graduated from normal schools or were transferred from elementary schools with only a middle school cultural level, now eight have been raised to the level of college graduates, and four are now able to teach first and second year high school courses. Students are relatively satisfied with their lectures.

    Secondly, teachers prepare lessons carefully. On the basis of individual research, give play to collective wisdom, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and improve together. In order to deeply understand the spiritual essence of the teaching materials, teachers, in addition to studying the teaching reference books compiled and printed by the education administrative department, also collect and read reference materials in many ways. When teaching Chairman Mao's lesson "Can bad things be turned into good things," the Chinese language teachers read many works by Chairman Mao such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Protracted War," and "On Contradiction," from which they understood Chairman Mao's thinking.

    Teachers in this school often listen to each other's classes. Under normal circumstances, each person listens to at least thirty or forty classes per semester, and some listen to more than one hundred classes. After listening to the classes, they can directly put forward suggestions for improvement.

    While teachers in this school prepare and teach well, they also pay attention to carefully correcting students' homework and often conduct after-school tutoring. Teachers correct all homework of students in all subjects. Teachers have strict requirements for students, especially for Chinese language homework. If the handwriting is sloppy, students are required to rewrite it. As a result of teachers doing this, not only have they supervised and helped students' learning, but also enabled teachers to specifically understand students' knowledge level, find ways to improve and improve teaching, and closely relate the relationship between teachers and students.

    Third, in the teaching process, teachers pay attention to correctly handling the relationship between major basic courses and general basic courses. For major basic courses such as Chinese, mathematics, physics and chemistry, strengthen basic training. For other courses, such as geography, increase classroom questioning, and focus on key points, trying to make students understand and digest them in class. In order to improve students' writing ability, the Chinese language teachers assigned a total of twelve compositions last semester, all of which were fully corrected and guided.

    In addition, the school also gave play to the role of the school's Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations, and reasonably arranged work. The Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and class teachers strengthened the education of students' learning goals and cultivated students' perseverance in learning through various activities.

    坚持政治挂帅才能提高教学质量
    长春第九中学贯彻党的教育方针跃为全市先进学校
    本报讯　长春市第九中学在教学工作中加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发挥教师的主导作用，积极鼓励全校师生立雄心、长大志，力争赶上先进学校教学水平，教学质量显著提高，学校树立起新的学风。几年来毕业生升学考试都获得优异的成绩。1959年合乎录取标准的初中毕业生占全校升学考试的学生总人数的98.8％，成为全市的先进学校。目前，该校正在认真贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，检查和修改了学校计划，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，全面深入地贯彻党的教育方针，进一步提高教学质量，并加强生产劳动基地建设，使学校各方面工作再提高一步。他们已经提出了几项具体措施：首先，在教学方面提高三大主要基础课程的教学质量，同时全面提高各科教学质量；其次，开展教学研究活动，总结学校历年来的教学工作，吸取其它先进学校工作经验；第三，要求教师认真备课，学校经常督促、检查教学工作，发现问题，及时帮助解决。在生产劳动方面，准备进一步办好工厂、农场、饲养场，并且在今年第四季度做好明年生产的准备。
    第九中学几年来的教育实践证明，条件差的学校只要加强政治思想教育工作，充分发挥教师的主导作用，完全能够提高教学质量。第九中学是1954年新建的一所学校，在教师、教学设备等许多方面都不如市内其它中学。由于学校刚刚建立，教学质量比较低，当时学生瞧不起学校，不安心读书；教师也不安心教课，要求调动工作。这些都严重阻碍党的教育方针的贯彻，影响教学质量的提高。经过肃反、整风等一系列的政治运动，在教师提高政治思想觉悟、坚定教育事业心的基础上，学校分析了师生的思想情况，认为青年教师多是好事，他们政治热情高、肯于学习，只要坚持政治挂帅，提高教师的业务水平，充分调动一切积极因素，教学质量是能够提高的。1957年，这所学校将培养出第一届毕业生，学校党组织从这一学年开始便抓住时机，及时地提出了响亮的口号：教师教好、学生学好，赶上先进学校的教学水平，为祖国培养质量高的人材，给学校争光。在学校党组织的号召下，教师、学生都制定了计划，保证教好、学好。全校师生干劲十足、信心百倍。教师积极钻研，认真备课教课，加强课外辅导。学生也勤学苦练，奋发读书，热爱劳动。全校迅速呈现出一个努力学习、积极劳动、刻苦钻研、尊师爱生、团结和睦的新学风。
    第九中学在工作中，根据本校的具体情况，突出地做了以下几方面工作。
    在政治挂帅的前提下，首先注意提高教师的文化水平和业务能力。学校领导上积极组织教师参加长春市进修学院和吉林师大举办的函授学习，并保证教师的学习时间。由于教师坚持自学，学校积极帮助教师安排学习时间，几年来教师的知识水平有显著提高。原来从中师毕业和由小学调来仅有中学文化水平的十三名教师，现在有八人已经提高到专科学校毕业水平，有四人已经能教高中一、二年级的课程，学生对他们的讲课比较满意。
    其次，教师认真备课，在个人钻研的基础上，发挥集体的智慧，互相切磋琢磨，取长补短，共同提高。为了深入体会教材的精神实质，教师除了研究教育行政部门编印的教学参考书之外，还多方面搜集、阅读参考材料。语文教师在讲毛主席的“坏事能否变好事”一课时，阅读了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“论持久战”、“矛盾论”等许多著作，从中体会毛主席的思想。
    这个学校教师之间经常互相听课，一般情况下，每学期每人至少听三、四十节，多的达一百多节。听课之后能够直截了当地提出改进意见。
    这个学校在教师备课好、教好的同时，还注意细致批改学生作业，经常进行课后辅导，教师对学生的各科作业，都全批全改。教师对学生有严格的要求，特别是语文作业，书法潦草的，就要求学生重写。教师这样做的结果，不但督促、帮助了学生的学习，也使教师具体地了解到学生的知识水平，找到了改进、提高教学的途径，密切了师生关系。
    第三，教学过程中，教师注意正确处理主要基础课程和一般基础课程的关系，对语文、数学理化等主要基础课程，加强基本训练，其它课程，如地理课，增加课堂提问，讲授重点突出，尽量做到使学生当堂理解消化。语文教师为了提高学生的写作能力，上学期共作文十二次，都全批全改，还进行作文指导。
    另外，学校还发挥了学校共青团、少先队组织的作用，合理地安排了工作。共青团、少先队和班主任通过各种活动，加强了学生的学习目的的教育，培养学生的学习毅力。
