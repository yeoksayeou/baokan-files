Following the great leap forward achieved in August and September under the inspiration of the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the vast number of workers on the capital's industrial front have entered October with even greater vigor and are continuing to advance at high speed. A number of factories have broken the historical convention of lower production at the beginning of the month compared to the end of the previous month or the whole month, and a new situation of a "red opening," "daily red," and gradual increase in production has emerged. The workers are determined to increase production every ten days and every month, and complete the annual production plan half a month or more ahead of schedule with one vigorous effort.

Due to the early and full preparation of many factories and mining enterprises in September for the fourth quarter production in terms of ideology, materials, and organization, and the formulation of specific measures to implement the plans down to the team or individual level, the entire industrial front in the city has been ablaze since the beginning of October. Although there were holidays and the number of working days in the first ten days was generally reduced by two to four days, the city's major products such as electricity, coal, pig iron, steel, steel products, coke, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn all overfulfilled the plan for the first ten days of October. Among them, the average daily output of steel increased by 1.2% compared to late September, pig iron increased by 5.3%, and steel products increased by 21.6% compared to the same period in September. The Beijing Steel Plant has been overproducing every day for the past ten days, and completed the plan for the first ten days with an overproduction of four hundred and eighty tons of high-quality steel, with an average daily output increase of 12.6% compared to September. The Jingxi Coal Mine is carrying out a red flag competition for comprehensive bumper production, and the daily output of raw coal in the entire bureau is increasing day by day.

Continuously opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and carrying out a vigorous and diverse socialist labor emulation campaign are important guarantees for overfulfilling the plan for the first ten days. At present, there are many forms of competition in the city, including inter-factory competitions in various industries; intra-trade competitions among foundry workers, forging workers, and boiler workers; dragon-like cooperation competitions between workshops and work processes; and pacesetter competitions, championship competitions, and expert competitions between shifts, teams, people, and machine tools, targeting advanced individuals or advanced collectives; and competitions of thousands of machine hours, hundred-minute competitions, etc., with advanced indicators as the common goal. These different forms and contents of competitions are carried out simultaneously, forming a crisscrossing competition network that attracts all workers in the city to participate in the competition. For example, the First Machine Tool Plant participated in the inter-factory competition of the city's electromechanical system, the foundry workers, forging workers, and planing workers participated in the inter-factory intra-trade competition respectively, and the workshops and work processes in the plant had a dragon-like cooperation competition. Shifts, teams, individuals, and machine tools had various opponent competitions. More than 95% of the workers in the plant were involved in the competition movement. The workers of the North China Radio Equipment United Factory vigorously carried out opponent competitions where they chased after each other, and new production records and new high-yield and high-quality pacesetters emerged everywhere. Liu Fengrong, a worker from the Yin Team, first broke the team's one-month record of 1,600 pieces with a new record of 2,010 insulators per day, and then Liu Wenxiu and Cao Ju exceeded Liu Fengrong with 2,400 pieces and 2,300 pieces per day, respectively.

Continuously and deeply engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution is one of the important reasons for the continuous great leap forward in production in many factories. The workers of the Beijing Mechanical Printing and Dyeing Factory proposed more than 1,200 technological innovation proposals in three days from the 5th to the 8th, of which half have been or are being implemented. Due to the adoption of advanced methods such as double-layer high-efficiency drying, the production level has been greatly improved, and the daily output of dyed cloth has increased from 198,000 meters in late September to 257,000 meters in the first ten days of October. The average daily output value of the entire factory in the first ten days increased by 17.88% compared to late September. Workers at the Beijing Automobile Factory proposed 291 technological innovation proposals from the 5th to the 9th, of which 79 have been implemented. Liu Qifen, a worker in the metalworking workshop, improved the operation method of the carburetor choke shaft on the first day of work in October, which increased production efficiency by more than five times.

Like the Great Leap Forward last year, leading cadres of various industrial departments and factories and mining enterprises in the city went to the front line of production to grasp measures, plans, and inspections, and timely solve various problems in production, which strongly promoted the great leap forward in production in the first ten days. On the first day of work after the festival, the Chaoyang District organized a city-wide hundred-person industrial inspection and promotion team consisting of the district party secretary and leading cadres of various factories, and formed ten groups according to industries such as machinery, chemical industry, and textile industry, which went to various factories to supervise and inspect. Leading cadres of the Beijing Clothing Factory went to the workshops four times a day to check plans and solve production problems.

In order to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and to prepare for next year, the city's workers have put forward a new slogan of "higher day by day, higher ten days by ten days, and higher month by month."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 13th. Under the slogan of "Work Hard in Red October, October Surpasses September, and Greet the Heroes' Conference with New Production Achievements," the workers on the Tianjin industrial front have achieved new victories in the first ten days of October. According to the statistics of the six industrial bureaus in Tianjin, although there were fewer working days in the first ten days, the city's average daily output value increased by 17.38% compared with the first ten days of September, completing 100.28% of the plan for the first ten days of this month. The main products that completed the output plan include: power generation, steel, refractory bricks, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, rubber shoes, cigarettes, paper and paperboard, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and printed and dyed cloth.

In the first ten days of October, in the magnificent production upsurge, the workers of many factories continued to deeply boost their morale and oppose right-leaning tendencies by summarizing the experience of the great battle in August and September, and tried every means to take effective measures to grasp and solve practical problems, and production waves were higher than waves. In the battle, the city's steel workers brought into play their soaring energy, and the steel output in the first ten days of October increased by more than 2% compared with the last ten days of September. The output of the light industry front also rose steadily. The workers of the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill took effective measures to speed up the speed of the car under the premise of ensuring the quality of the paper, so that the average daily output of paper in the first ten days of October increased by more than 10% compared with the last ten days of September.

In the first ten days of October, many factories vigorously promoted advanced experience and made great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution on the basis of the third quarter's large-scale evaluation and comparison, which played a great role in ensuring the completion of the plan. The eighteen advanced experiences summarized in the fourth glass factory's large-scale evaluation and comparison were promoted in the first ten days of October, and one hundred and twenty-six production workers learned and mastered advanced operating experience, and production was generally improved, which ensured the overfulfillment of the factory's plan for the first ten days.

　　劳动竞赛轰轰烈烈　技术革新蓬蓬勃勃
    京津工业生产一浪高一浪
    头十天钢、铁、煤、机械、轻工业大大超过九月下旬日产水平
    本报讯　在党的八届八中全会伟大号召的鼓舞下，8、9两月实现了空前大跃进的首都工业战线上的广大职工，进入10月后，以更大干劲继续高速前进。一批工厂打破了月初生产低于上月下旬或全月水平的历史惯例，出现了“开门红”、“日日红”、生产步步登高的新局面。职工们决心使生产旬旬上升、月月提高，一鼓作气提前半月或更多的时间完成全年生产计划。
    由于很多厂矿企业在9月份及早为第四季度的生产作了思想、物质、组织等各方面的充分准备，并订出了具体措施，把计划落实到了小组或个人。10月开始，全市工业战线上就火红一片，虽然节日放假，上旬工作日一般减少两天到四天，全市电力、煤炭、生铁、钢、钢材、焦炭、棉布、棉纱等主要产品都超额完成了10月上旬计划，其中钢的平均日产量比9月下旬提高了1.2％。生铁提高了5.3％，钢材比9月同期提高了21.6％。北京钢厂十天来天天超产，以超额四百八十吨优质钢的成绩完成了上旬计划，平均日产量比9月提高了12.6％。京西煤矿大搞全面丰产的红旗竞赛，全局原煤日产量一天高过一天。
    不断反右倾、鼓干劲，开展了轰轰烈烈多种多样的社会主义劳动竞赛，是上旬超额完成计划的重要保证。现在全市的竞赛形式很多，有各行业的厂际竞赛；有铸工、锻工、锅炉工的同工种竞赛；有各车间各工序之间的一条龙协作竞赛；有班与班、组与组、人与人、机台与机台之间以先进人物或先进集体为追赶对象的标兵赛、冠军赛、能手赛；有以先进指标为共同奋斗目标的千台时、百分钟竞赛等等。这些不同形式、不同内容的竞赛同时并举，形成了纵横交错的竞赛网，把全市职工都吸引到竞赛中来。如第一机床厂参加了全市机电系统的厂际竞赛，铸工、锻工、刨工分别参加了厂际同工种竞赛，厂内各车间工序又有一条龙协作竞赛，班、组、个人、机台有各种对手赛，全厂95％以上的职工都卷入了竞赛运动。华北无线电器材联合厂的工人，大搞你追我赶的对手赛，新的生产纪录和新的高产优质标兵到处涌现，被银小组工人刘凤荣以日产绝缘子二千零十只的新成绩，首先打破了小组保持一个月的一千六百只的纪录，接着刘文秀、曹菊又以日产二千四百只、二千三百只超过了刘凤荣。
    不断深入地大搞技术革新和技术革命，是很多工厂生产连续大跃进的重要原因之一。北京市机制印染厂职工5到8日三天内即提出了一千二百多项技术革新建议，其中有半数已经或正在实现。由于采取了双层高效烘干等先进办法，生产水平大大提高，染布的日产量从9月下旬的十九万八千米提高到10月上旬的二十五万七千米，全厂上旬平均日产值比9月下旬提高了17.88％。北京汽车厂工人从5日到9日提出了二百九十一项技术革新建议，已经实现了七十九项。金工车间工人刘启芬10月上工的第一天就改进了生产化油器阻风门轴的操作方法，使生产效率提高了五倍多。
    像去年大跃进一样，全市各工业部门和各厂矿企业的领导干部，纷纷走上生产第一线抓措施、抓计划、抓检查，及时解决生产中的各种问题，有力地促进了上旬生产的大跃进。朝阳区在节后开工第一天，就由区委书记和各工厂领导干部组成了全区性的百人工业检查促进团，按机器、化工、纺织等行业组成了十个组，分别到各厂督促和检查。北京被服厂领导干部每日四次下车间检查计划和解决生产问题。
    为了提前超额完成今年计划，并且为明年做好准备，全市职工又提出“一天高过一天，一旬高过一旬，一月高过一月”新的口号。
    本报天津13日电　天津市工业战线上的职工在“大干红十月，十月超九月，以新的生产成就迎接群英会”的口号下，10月上旬又取得了新的胜利。据天津市六个工业局的统计，上旬虽然工作日少，但全市平均日产值比9月上旬增长17.38％，完成本月份上旬计划的100.28％。完成产量计划的主要产品有：发电量、钢材、耐火砖、硫酸、烧碱、胶鞋、卷烟、纸及纸板、棉纱、棉布、印染布等。
    10月上旬，在波澜壮阔的生产高潮中，许多工厂的职工通过总结大战8、9月的经验，继续深入鼓干劲、反右倾，千方百计采取有效措施，抓紧解决实际问题，生产一浪高过一浪。全市钢铁工人在战斗中，发挥了冲天干劲，10月上旬钢产量比9月下旬提高了2％以上。轻工业战线产量也节节上升。国营天津造纸总厂职工采取有效措施，在保证纸张质量的前提下，加快了车速，使10月上旬纸张平均日产量比9月下旬提高10％以上。
    10月上旬，许多工厂在第三季度大评大比的基础上，大力推广先进经验，大闹技术革新和技术革命，对于保证完成计划起了很大作用。第四玻璃厂大评大比中总结的十八项先进经验，在10月上旬推广了十项，有一百二十六名生产工人学习掌握了先进操作经验，生产普遍提高，保证了全厂上旬计划超额完成。（附图片）
