Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 9th -- By the end of September, Shandong Province had overfulfilled its early autumn grain procurement task for this year. The province's procurement progress was very fast, with the amount of autumn grain stored exceeding twice that of the same period last year. Currently, various regions are vigorously grasping the harvesting and sale of late autumn grain, striving to complete the annual grain procurement task quickly and well ahead of schedule.

The reason why this year's early autumn grain procurement was completed so quickly and well is mainly that Party committees at all levels strengthened the education of the general line of socialist construction, which inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. Anqiu County, combined with the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, helped the masses calculate three accounts (the account of industry supporting agriculture and achieving a bumper grain harvest, the account of state loans and support, and the account of state grain purchase and sales comparison). After this, the broad masses of people's commune members sold more and faster surplus grain to the state to support socialist construction.

In the early autumn grain procurement work, various regions conscientiously implemented the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, closely integrating procurement and distribution, and comprehensively arranged the lives of commune members, thus further inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses to deliver grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th -- While vigorously grasping autumn harvesting and production, Party committees in various parts of Jiangsu Province have strengthened their leadership over autumn grain procurement work, grasping each harvest as it comes, grasping it early, tightly, and well. As of October 2nd, the amount of autumn grain procured and stored in the province had increased by 63% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the three special districts of Xuzhou, Yancheng, and Nantong, north of the Yangtze River, have all overfulfilled their early and mid-autumn grain procurement tasks.

Nearly 40 million mu of early and mid-autumn crops in the province have been harvested, with better yields than last year. Party committees in various regions, led by the secretaries, mobilized at all levels, and implemented the requirements of grasping early, tightly, and well from top to bottom, vigorously carrying out autumn grain procurement work. The Party committees of counties and communes in the Nantong Special District, using the experience from the summer grain procurement, strengthened political and ideological work, and launched a "five comparisons" competition: comparing good task completion, comparing good plan execution, comparing good grain quality, comparing fast grain delivery, and comparing good business work. Therefore, the entire district overfulfilled the early and mid-autumn grain procurement task.

Autumn grain procurement in various regions is being carried out in close conjunction with distribution work. Grasping procurement with one hand, distribution with the other, unified purchase with one hand, and unified sales with the other, achieving satisfaction for the state, the collective, and the individual, and promoting the acceleration of procurement progress.

Currently, various parts of Jiangsu are advancing victoriously, striving to complete the annual grain procurement task ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th -- Anhui's rural areas, in the first year after communization, have provided more surplus grain than last year to support national construction. By the end of September, the amount of grain procured throughout the province had increased by 29% compared to the same period last year.

This year, Anhui Province had a general bumper harvest of summer and early autumn crops; although the mid-autumn crops suffered from a severe drought, the broad masses, under the leadership of the Party, overcame the drought, and the yield still greatly exceeded last year.

While celebrating the bumper harvest, the broad masses of peasants enthusiastically handed over public grain and sold surplus grain. Yuexi County in the Dabie Mountains, after achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest in the summer and autumn seasons, mobilized 80,000 laborers and overfulfilled the annual grain procurement task within twenty days. Currently, five counties and two hundred and eighty people's communes in the province have completed the annual grain procurement task ahead of schedule.

Grain procurement in Anhui Province is being carried out in conjunction with commune distribution. While handing over and selling procured grain, people's communes in various regions, based on grain output, have retained sufficient rations, seeds, and necessary feed according to regulations. In the procurement work, in addition to grain stations and grain processing plants receiving grain, grain departments in various regions have also added more than 1,200 grain receiving points along transportation lines, making it very convenient for the masses to deliver grain.

    深入加强思想教育　征购分配紧密结合
    山东完成早秋粮食征购任务
    江苏安徽征购入库数量超过去年同期
    据新华社济南9日电　山东省到9月底为止已经超额完成了今年早秋粮食征购任务，全省征购进度很快，入库的秋粮比去年同期增加一倍以上。现在各地正在大抓晚秋粮食的收打交售，争取又快又好地提前完成全年粮食征购任务。
    今年早秋粮食征购之所以完成得又快又好，主要是各级党委加强了社会主义建设总路线的教育，鼓舞了广大农民的爱国热情。安丘县结合贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，帮助群众算了三笔账（工业支援农业取得粮食丰收账，国家贷款扶持账，国家粮食购销对比账）之后，广大人民公社社员纷纷多卖快卖余粮给国家，支援社会主义建设。
    各地在早秋粮食征购工作中，认真贯彻了统筹兼顾、全面安排的原则，使征购和分配紧密结合，全面安排了社员生活，因而更加鼓舞了群众的交粮热情。
    据新华社南京9日电　江苏省各地党委在狠抓秋熟生产的同时，加强了对秋粮征购工作的领导，上来一熟抓一熟，抓早、抓紧、抓好。到10月2日止，全省征购入库秋粮比去年同期增加63％。其中，长江北部的徐州、盐城、南通三个专区，都已经超额完成了早中秋粮食征购任务。
    全省近四千万亩早中秋作物已经收割完毕，收成比去年好。各地党委都由书记挂帅，层层动员，从上到下地贯彻了抓早、抓紧、抓好的要求，大力开展秋粮征购工作。南通专区各县和公社党委，运用夏粮征购中的经验，加强政治思想工作，开展了“五比”竞赛：比完成任务好，比执行计划好，比粮食质量好，比粮食送得快，比业务工作做得好，因此全区超额完成了早中秋粮食征购任务。
    各地秋粮征购是同分配工作紧密结合进行的。一手抓征购，一手抓分配，一手抓统购，一手抓统销，做到了国家、集体、个人三满意，促使征购进度加快。
    目前，江苏各地正乘胜前进，争取提前完成全年粮食征购任务。
    据新华社合肥9日电　公社化后第一年的安徽农村，比去年提供了更多的余粮支援国家建设。到9月底为止，全省征购的粮食已比去年同期增加了29％。
    今年，安徽省夏收作物和早秋作物普遍丰收；中秋作物虽然受到大旱，但是广大群众在党的领导下，战胜了旱灾，产量仍然大大超过去年。
    广大农民在喜庆丰收的同时，踊跃地交公粮、卖余粮。大别山区的岳西县在夏秋季获得全面丰收以后，出动了八万个劳力，在二十天内就超额完成了全年的粮食征购任务。现在全省已有五个县、二百八十个人民公社提前完成了全年的粮食征购任务。
    安徽省的粮食征购是同公社分配结合进行的。各地人民公社在交售征购粮的同时，都根据粮食产量，按照规定留足口粮、种籽和必要的饲料。各地粮食部门在征购工作中，除了就粮站、粮食加工厂接收粮食以外，在交通沿线还增设了一千二百多个粮食接收点，群众送粮很方便。
