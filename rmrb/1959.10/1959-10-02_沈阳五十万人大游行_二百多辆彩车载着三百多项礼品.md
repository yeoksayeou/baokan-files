Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st -- Today, 500,000 people in Shenyang held a grand rally and parade to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country.

At dawn, the city was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and people in festive costumes flocked to the Municipal People's Committee Square from all corners.

Kim Yong-bin, Consul General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Shenyang, along with all the staff of the Consulate, the delegation of the Soviet Far East Military District, the youth delegation of the Irkutsk Oblast of the Soviet Union, and the delegation of the Party and Government of North Pyongan Province of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who were invited from afar, as well as Soviet experts and experts from other socialist countries who are helping our country in socialist construction in Shenyang, joined the people from all walks of life in Shenyang today to celebrate this great festival.

At 9:00 a.m., the conference began with gun salutes and the national anthem. Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that the city's total industrial output value in 1958 increased by 70% compared with 1957, and by 20.5 times compared with 1949. On the basis of the overall Great Leap Forward last year, the various production fronts in Shenyang City continued to leap forward this year. From January to August, the city's total industrial output value increased by 53.7% compared with the same period last year. Jiao Ruoyu finally called on the people of the city to resolutely respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, further carry out the vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to achieve this year's national economic plan.

After the speech, a gift-giving contingent, led by a pair of large golden double happiness characters and guided by a tall model of a lighthouse symbolizing the Party's general line for building socialism, passed the rostrum. Behind them followed more than 200 colorful floats, carrying 332 various gifts. Among them was a model of a heavy-duty steel blooming mill with a roll diameter of 800 mm, which was completed ahead of schedule on September 29 by the workers of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant. This set of large rolling equipment was designed by our country and can roll more than one million tons of steel per year.

    二百多辆彩车载着三百多项礼品
    据新华社沈阳1日电　今天，沈阳市五十万人举行庆祝我国建国十周年的盛大集会和游行。
    凌晨，全市锣鼓喧天，穿着节日盛装的人们从各个角落涌向市人民委员会广场。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻沈阳总领事金龙彬同领事馆全体人员，应邀远道而来的苏联远东军区代表团、苏联伊尔库茨克州青年代表团、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国平安北道党政代表团，在沈阳帮助我国进行社会主义建设的苏联专家和其他社会主义国家的专家，今天同沈阳各界人民一道，欢庆这个伟大的节日。
    上午九时，大会在礼炮和国歌声中开始。中共沈阳市委第一书记焦若愚在会上讲话。他说，全市1958年的工业总产值比1957年增长70％，比1949年增长二十点五倍。在去年全面大跃进的基础上，今年沈阳市各个生产战线继续大跃进，从1月到8月，全市工业总产值比去年同时期增长了53.7％。焦若愚最后号召全市人民坚决响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，反右倾，鼓干劲，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，为实现今年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    讲话以后，以一对金色大双喜字为前导的献礼大队，在象征着党的建设社会主义总路线的高大的灯塔模型引导下，走过主席台。后面紧跟着二百多辆五彩缤纷的彩车，载着三百三十二项各种各样的礼品。其中有沈阳重型机器厂职工在9月29日提前制成的轧辊直径为八百公厘的重型钢材开坯机的模型。这套大型轧钢设备是我国自己设计的，每年可以轧制一百多万吨钢材。
