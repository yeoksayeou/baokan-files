Comrades of the officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and comrades of the militia:

    Today is the glorious festival of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China. We, together with the people of the whole country, comrades from socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and friends from all over the world, warmly celebrate the great achievements of our country over the past ten years.

    Ten years ago today, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great people's leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after a long and arduous struggle, won the victory of the democratic revolution and declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Since then, our country has entered a new period of socialist revolution. In the first three years after the victory, under the leadership of the Party, our people thoroughly completed the land reform and other democratic reforms, and completed the economic recovery work. Subsequently, the Party put forward the general line for the transition period, and socialist revolution and socialist construction were carried out simultaneously, successfully completing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and basically realizing the socialist ownership of the means of production. At this time, while our people were constantly carrying out socialist transformation and construction at home, they were also carrying out the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army defeated the aggressor army headed by the United States. The completion and over-completion of the first Five-Year Plan, which began in 1953, laid a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization. In 1958, after the victory of the rectification movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, our people, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, were full of fighting spirit and high spirits, and launched an all-round great leap forward in the national economy. At the same time, people's communes were universally established in the rural areas across the country. After a short period of effort, the people's communes have been consolidated and embarked on a path of sound development, and are showing their superiority in developing production and overcoming natural disasters. Under the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, science and technology and cultural education have also achieved unprecedented development. As a result of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, the main targets of the original Second Five-Year Plan may be completed three years ahead of schedule. The goal of catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years will also be achieved ahead of schedule in about ten years. In just ten short years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have accomplished the great and glorious cause that our predecessors have never done. Socialism has basically defeated capitalism in all aspects. The history of class exploitation for thousands of years has basically come to an end. The face of poverty and backwardness is rapidly changing. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, all ethnic groups in our country are united in a large family, and now they are developing their economy and culture at an unprecedented speed and prosperity. All this fully proves that the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party's general line of socialist revolution and socialist construction are correct; it proves that the "walking on two legs" policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large enterprises and medium and small enterprises, and simultaneously developing foreign methods of production and local methods of production under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and collaboration, and the policy of relying on the masses and developing mass movements in economic construction are correct. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the great leap forward in socialist construction are the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, the result of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and the product of the combination of the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the revolutionary will of 650 million people. Any threats, slanders, and sabotage by imperialism and reactionary forces against our country, and any attacks and accusations by right-leaning opportunists, cannot stop the Chinese people from heading towards their great goals! We must build China into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture within several five-year plan periods!

    The achievements of our country's socialist construction are inseparable from the fraternal assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal countries, as well as the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the world. Now, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have formed a united and friendly socialist family, accounting for one-third of the world's population and connected across Eurasia. For the past ten years, our country has consistently safeguarded the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, vigorously supported the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, resolutely opposed the war policies and aggression policies of imperialism headed by the United States, consistently adhered to the peaceful diplomatic policy, adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and achieved great achievements in the struggle to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. Our friends are all over the world.

    The armed forces of the People's Republic of China are moving towards building an excellent modern revolutionary army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the defender of the socialist motherland and the builder of socialism. In the past ten years, in the struggle to suppress bandits, liberate coastal islands, and defend the motherland's borders, coasts, and air defense, in the struggle to punish the Chiang Kai-shek army in Kinmen and prepare to liberate Taiwan, and in the struggle to quell the rebellion of reactionary forces in Tibet, they have all successfully carried out the entrustment of the people of the motherland. The army's participation in and support of national economic construction and mass movements has also achieved significant results. Now, our army has developed from a single service into a combined arms army with modern technical equipment, and has also built a militia force with hundreds of millions of people participating. Since 1958, together with the people of the whole country, the army has also launched an all-round great leap forward with training as the center, which has greatly improved the army's political quality and combat effectiveness. Our country's armed forces are a strong force for defending peace. We will never invade anyone, but we will never allow anyone to invade us. The integrity of the sacred territory, airspace, and territorial sea sovereignty of the People's Republic of China must be respected. The Chinese people's desire to liberate their territory Taiwan and coastal islands and completely unify the great motherland by this method or that method must be realized, and foreign countries must not interfere.

    Comrades officers and soldiers, comrades militiamen: As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of the whole country are inspired by the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's call to oppose right-leaning and encourage hard work, and a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy has been formed. Our country's socialist construction is continuing to leap forward at high speed, and the domestic political and economic situation is very good, a scene of brightness. The international situation is also further developing in a direction favorable to peace, democracy, and socialism. The great Soviet Union and other socialist fraternal countries are all a scene of vigorous development; the flames of the anti-colonialist struggle are spreading and expanding all over the world; while imperialism is full of contradictions and shrouded in a shadow. Comrade Mao Zedong's wise judgment that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" and "the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day" is being confirmed by more and more facts. However, we must maintain sufficient vigilance against the aggressive conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists and all malicious instigations against the People's Republic of China. To this end, I order you: step up training and learning, arm your minds with Marxism-Leninism, conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, learn from the advanced military experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, constantly improve your political awareness and scientific and cultural level, vigorously improve military technology, so that everyone has a high degree of political awareness, is proficient in their business, and skillfully masters the weapons and equipment in their hands, so as to be competent to fulfill our glorious responsibility of defending national defense and preventing aggression. In the great leap forward of the motherland, every commander and fighter must enthusiastically support the people's masses, and participate in the country's economic construction and the construction of people's communes with possible strength according to their respective situations, and closely unite with the people's masses. The army and the people, officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates are united as one, holding high the red flag of the Party's general line and Mao Zedong's military thought, and our army is invincible!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    People of the whole of China, unite! People of the whole world, unite!
    Long live the general line! Long live the Great Leap Forward! Long live the People's Commune!
    Long live the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great, correct, and glorious Chinese Communist Party!
    Strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in China!
    Long live internationalism! (Attached picture)

### 中华人民共和国国防部命令

专栏：

    中华人民共和国国防部命令陆、海、空军全体官兵同志们，民兵同志们：
    今天，是我们中华人民共和国建国十周年的光荣节日。我们和全国人民一起，和来自以苏联为首的社会主义国家的同志们一起，和来自世界各地的朋友们一起，热烈地庆祝我国十周年来的伟大成就。
    十年前的今天，中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，经过长期的艰苦奋斗，赢得了民主革命的胜利，宣告了中华人民共和国的成立。从此，我国进入了社会主义革命的新时期。在胜利以后的头三年中，我国人民在党的领导下，彻底完成了土地改革和其它民主改革的任务，完成了经济恢复工作。接着，党提出了过渡时期的总路线，社会主义革命和社会主义建设同时并举，顺利地完成了对于农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，基本上实现了生产资料的社会主义所有制。这时候，我国人民一面在国内不停地进行着社会主义改造和建设的工作，一面又进行着伟大的抗美援朝战争。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起，打败了以美国为首的侵略军。1953年开始的第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成，为我国社会主义工业化奠定了初步基础。1958年，在全民的整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争取得胜利之后，我国人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，斗志昂扬，意气风发，展开了国民经济的全面大跃进。与此同时，在全国农村中普遍建立起人民公社，经过短期的努力，人民公社已经巩固起来，走上了健全发展的道路，在发展生产、战胜天灾等方面正在显示它的优越性。在党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”和教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针下，科学技术和文化教育事业也获得空前的大发展。大跃进和人民公社化的结果，使原定的第二个五年计划的主要指标，有可能提早三年完成。在主要工业产品的产量方面十五年内赶上英国的目标，也将在十年左右的时间内提前实现。短短的十年间，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，完成了我国前人从来没有做过的伟大光荣的事业。社会主义在各个方面已经基本上战胜了资本主义。几千年来阶级剥削的历史，已经基本结束。穷困和落后的面貌正在迅速地改变。我国各族人民在共产党的领导下，团结在一个大家庭里，现在，正以史无前例的速度，欣欣向荣地发展自己的经济和文化。这一切，充分证明党和毛泽东同志的领导，党的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的总路线是正确的；证明在经济建设中实行在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举，在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的“两条腿走路”的方针和在经济建设中实行依靠群众，发展群众运动的方针是正确的。中国革命的胜利和社会主义建设的大跃进是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的结果，是以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导和六亿五千万人民的革命意志相结合的产物。任何帝国主义和反动势力对我国的威胁、诬蔑和破坏，任何右倾机会主义分子的攻击和指责，都不能阻挡中国人民奔向自己的伟大目标！我们一定要把中国在几个五年计划时期内建成一个具有高度发达的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家！
    我国社会主义建设的成就，是同我们伟大盟邦苏联和其它兄弟国家的兄弟般的援助以及世界各国人民的同情和支持分不开的。现在，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家一起，结成了占世界人口三分之一、在欧亚两洲连成一片、团结友好的社会主义大家庭。十年来，我国一贯维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，大力支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，一贯坚持和平外交政策，坚守和平共处的五项原则，在维护远东与世界和平的斗争中，获得了巨大的成就。我们的朋友遍于天下。
    中华人民共和国的武装力量，正在向建设一支优良的现代化的革命军队迈进。中国人民解放军是祖国社会主义的保卫者又是社会主义的建设者。十年来在肃清残匪、解放沿海岛屿、保卫祖国边防、海防、空防的斗争中，在惩罚金门蒋军、准备解放台湾的斗争中，在平定西藏反动势力叛乱中，都圆满地执行了祖国人民的委托。军队参加和支援国家经济建设和群众运动，也取得了重大成绩。现在，我军已经从单一兵种发展成为有现代技术装备的诸兵种合成军队，并且还建设了一支有几亿人民参加的民兵队伍。1958年以来，同全国人民一起，军队也展开了以训练工作为中心的全面大跃进，极大地提高了军队的政治素质和战斗力。我国的武装力量，是一支保卫和平的坚强力量。我们决不会侵犯任何人，但是也决不容许任何人侵犯我们。中华人民共和国神圣的领土、领空和领海主权的完整，必须受到尊重，中国人民以这种方法或者那种方法解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿、完全统一伟大祖国的愿望，一定要得到实现，外国不得干涉。
    全体官兵同志们，民兵同志们：在我们庆祝建国十周年的时候，全国人民为党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的战斗号召所鼓舞，一个新的增产节约运动的大高潮已经形成起来，我国社会主义建设正在继续高速度地向前跃进，国内政治经济情况是很好的，是一片光明的。国际形势也在进一步向有利于和平、民主和社会主义的方向发展。伟大的苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家都是一片蓬勃景象；全世界反殖民主义斗争的烽火正在蔓延扩大；而帝国主义内部则矛盾重重，笼罩着一片阴影。毛泽东同志关于“东风压倒西风”和“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的英明论断，正为越来越多的事实所证实。但是，对于美帝国主义者的侵略阴谋和一切反对中华人民共和国的恶意煽动，我们必须保持足够的警惕。为此，我命令你们：加紧训练和学习，以马克思列宁主义武装自己的头脑，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进的军事经验，不断地提高自己的政治觉悟和科学文化水平，大力提高军事技术，使每一个人都具有高度政治觉悟，精通业务、熟练地掌握自己手中的武器和装备，以便胜任地履行我们保卫国防、防止侵略的光荣职责。在祖国的大跃进中，每一个指战员，都要满腔热情地支援人民群众，并且按照各自的情况以可能的力量参加国家的经济建设和人民公社的建设，密切与人民群众的团结。军队和人民，官和兵，上级和下级团结一致，高举党的总路线和毛泽东军事思想的红旗，我们的军队是不可战胜的！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    全中国人民团结起来！全世界人民团结起来！
    总路线万岁！大跃进万岁！人民公社万岁！
  　以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    伟大、正确、光荣的中国共产党万岁！
  　为争取全世界的持久和平和人民民主而斗争！
    中国各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
  　国际主义万岁！（附图片）
