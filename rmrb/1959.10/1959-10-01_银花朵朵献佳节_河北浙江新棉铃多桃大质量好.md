Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th: Hebei Province, one of China's major cotton-producing areas, is experiencing a widespread cotton harvest from south to north. According to preliminary statistics from late September, the province has already harvested over 394 million jin of seed cotton.

    Inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, commune members in cotton-growing areas throughout the province are in high spirits and are continuing to strengthen the later-stage management of cotton. They have also launched a competition climax of picking, harvesting, and selling cotton as it ripens. In Handan Prefecture, over 960,000 people are involved in later-stage cotton management and harvesting. After discussion, commune members of the Cixian and Cheng'an Communes decided to achieve a yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. Before the first bloom was finished being picked, the commune's 100,000 mu of cotton had already yielded 11.2 million jin of seed cotton, averaging 112 jin per mu. The "10,000-mu high-yield plot" has already harvested an average of 240 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    This year, the 14 million mu of cotton in Hebei Province are growing very well: there is less boll shedding, more boll setting, earlier ripening, longer fibers, and higher quality. The high-yield plots, which account for a quarter of the total cotton area, are growing even more vigorously. According to surveys: in the Handan Prefecture, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, and the southern main cotton-producing areas of Tianjin, which accounts for 11 million mu of cotton, each mu has about 3,000 plants. On average, each plant has 8 or 9 mature bolls, 2 young bolls, and 2 or 3 flower buds. The high-yield plots have an average of 13 or 14 mature bolls per plant.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th: Zhejiang Province's 1.8 million mu of cotton has fully entered its peak harvesting season.

    This year, cotton in Zhejiang Province is generally growing well, with many bolls, large cotton fruits, and white, fluffy fibers. Since the 480,000 mu of cotton in Cixi County, a major cotton-producing area in the province, began harvesting, yields have generally increased compared to last year, and it is expected to increase by 20% to 30%. The new cotton areas of 600,000 mu have also achieved a bumper harvest. In Jinhua County, the new cotton area planted 58,000 mu of cotton for the first time, averaging 101 jin of seed cotton harvested per mu. (Picture attached)

    银花朵朵献佳节
    河北浙江新棉铃多桃大质量好
    据新华社天津30日电　我国主要产棉区之一河北省的棉花，从南到北普遍丰收。据9月下旬初步统计，全省已收摘籽棉三亿九千四百多万斤。
    全省棉区人民公社社员在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，正在继续加强棉花后期管理，并且掀起了随吐絮、随收摘、随交售的竞赛高潮。邯郸专区有九十六万多人投入棉花后期管理和收摘工作。磁县成安公社的社员们经过讨论决心在今年实现亩产皮棉二百斤，全社十万亩棉花，头喷花还没有摘完，就已经摘了籽棉一千一百二十万斤，平均每亩一百一十二斤，其中的“万亩丰产方”，平均每亩已收摘籽棉二百四十斤。
    今年河北省一千四百多万亩棉花，生长发育得非常好：落铃少，结桃多，吐絮早，纤维长，品级高。占棉田总面积四分之一的丰产方，棉花长得更为茁壮。据调查：邯郸专区、石家庄专区及天津市南部主要产棉区的一千一百多万亩棉花，每亩三千株左右，一般平均每株有成铃八、九个，幼铃两个，花蕾两三个。丰产方平均每株成铃达十三、四个。
    据新华社杭州30日电　浙江省一百八十万亩棉花已全面进入收摘旺季。
    今年浙江省棉花普遍生长良好，结铃多，棉桃大，吐絮白。全省主要棉区慈溪县四十八万亩棉花开摘以来，产量普遍比去年提高，预计可以增产两三成。新棉区的六十万亩棉花，也获得丰收。金华县新棉区第一年种五万八千亩棉花，平均每亩已收获籽棉一百零一斤。（附图片）
