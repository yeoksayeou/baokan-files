　　Sunshine Shines on Lhasa
　　Gelai
　　In the morning, when the sun emerges from the eastern rosy clouds, the ancient city of Lhasa, known as the "City of Sunlight," is bathed in golden sunlight. At this time, the streets are bustling with people and traffic, and it begins to liven up. On the Lhasa River, the sailors of the yak-hide boats row their swift vessels, singing sonorous songs, heading towards the wide Yarlung Tsangpo River. The labor army composed of Tibetan and Han workers emerges from various courtyards and alleys, strides with bold steps, and enters the factories, rushing towards the boiling construction sites. Vehicles loaded with various supplies travel back and forth on the smooth roads...

　　I ascended the thirteen-story Potala Palace, and the panoramic view of the ancient city came into view. Under the clear blue sky, the lush green Linka gardens are like summer attire worn by the ancient city, appearing particularly beautiful and young. Lhasa, this ancient city, has a history of more than 1,300 years. Although it has experienced a long period of time, only today can we see that it has undergone unprecedented changes and embarked on a new path.

　　In Lhasa, I have often strolled along Barkhor Street, visited shops, entered the Jokhang Temple, and also visited Lhasa's open-air market. In these places, everything is just like in the past; Tibetans freely enter and exit, and lamas still burn incense and kowtow in the Jokhang Temple as usual. But, when I entered the newly established residents' committee in Lhasa, entered the courtyards where Tibetans live, and entered the homes of Tibetans, I found the changes and the pulse of the ancient city beating.

　　As soon as I entered a residential area in the eastern city, I saw a Tibetan woman in her thirties conducting door-to-door propaganda. Her name is Gesang. Not long ago, she was still a Langsheng (serf) of a noble, being a "lowly person" for more than twenty years. In those days of suffering, when she was treated like cattle and horses and suffered all kinds of torture, Gesang herself also thought she was a "bitterly fated person" and "resigned to fate," with no confidence in liberating herself. Now, she has realized that her fate can no longer be left to others to manipulate, and that she should take control of it herself. Moreover, she firmly believes that with the Communist Party, she will have everything. Recently, she was elected as a leader of the Dongcheng District Residents' Committee. A few days ago, she also attended the second plenary session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region as a nonvoting delegate. After returning, she actively publicized the various resolutions of the meeting on carrying out democratic reforms to the broad masses of residents.

　　When I walked out of this residents' committee, I saw many Tibetan youths and women, as well as old ladies, carrying schoolbags and holding books and wooden boards for writing Tibetan, going to cultural schools. In the past, most of these people worked as servants for nobles or as Langsheng. Today, they are liberated. Some of them were illiterate in the past, but now they can read Tibetan newspapers and write Tibetan letters.

　　On the streets of Lhasa, I saw many large-scale new colored murals painted by Tibetans. There were "The End of the Dynasty," "The Fate of the Rebels," as well as national unity and Tiananmen, in various forms, just like a hundred flowers blooming. On the streets of Lhasa, a young Tibetan painter named Jianzan was concentrating on depicting a series of more than a dozen pictures of serf owners forcing serfs to death. A Tibetan woman was in tears as she looked at the paintings because her husband had been killed by the rebels.

　　In the past, there were many Tibetan painters in Lhasa, but under the rule of the great serf owners, for many years, they could only whitewash walls and paint clay bodhisattvas for the nobles. The painter Jianzan was once beaten by the rebels for painting a portrait of Chairman Mao. Now, in Jianzan's own words, "I am free. I can paint whatever I want."

　　When I walked on the streets of Lhasa, I saw many street propaganda teams from the residents' committees, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, waving five-star red flags, and beating gongs and drums, performing their newly composed living newspaper dramas and emancipation dances on the streets, carrying out propaganda on the various policies of democratic reform to the broad masses of Tibetans.

　　In the past, there were many beggars on the streets of Lhasa, especially during the Monlam Festival, when the number of beggars increased greatly. Along the Lhasa Lingkhor Road, many beggars lived in dilapidated low tents, or slept in the open, surrounded by human excrement, dog excrement, and garbage heaps. Many people had no tsampa to eat and no clothes to cover their bodies. Since the suppression of the rebellion in the Lhasa area, with the vigorous relief efforts of the Lhasa Military Control Commission, many beggars have had food to eat, houses to live in, and some have even found jobs.

　　The white-haired, eighty-year-old Tibetan elder Danzhen Bazhu was so excited that he couldn't close his mouth when he talked about the changes in the ancient city from the past to the present. In the past, he had wandered for half his life, helpless and without support. There was no one who sympathized with or cared for him. He often resented himself for "not dying old." But now, not only does he not want to die early, but he also wants to live to see socialism and communism. A few days ago, after he fell ill, the residents' committee sent people to take care of him, hire a doctor for him, sweep the floor, make tea, and cook meals, and also send tsampa and tea to help him. People from the left and right neighbors came to see him. These things moved him so much that he kept saying to everyone, "With the Communist Party, the world has changed, and the relationship between people is very different."

　　In the evening, when the red glow of the sunset dyes the Lhasa River valley plain, the sound of sanxians, pipas, and joyful songs and dances are heard from the courtyards of many residents, singing about the new life of today and also singing about the happy tomorrow.

　　阳光照到拉萨
　　格来
    早晨，太阳从东方的朝霞中露出来时，古老的日光城——拉萨，就沐浴在金色的阳光里。这时候大街上人来人往，车马熙攘，开始热闹起来。拉萨河上牛皮船的水手们划着飞快的船只，唱起高吭的歌子，驶向宽阔的雅鲁藏布江。藏汉族工人们组成的劳动大军从各个院落、胡同里走出来，踏着豪迈的步伐，走进了工厂，奔向了沸腾的工地。满载着各种物资的车辆来往奔驰在平坦的公路上……。
    我登上十三层高的布达拉宫，古城的全貌映入眼帘，在晴朗蔚蓝色的天空下，绿树荫浓的林卡，就像是古城穿起的夏装，显得格外美丽和年轻。拉萨，这个古城已经有一千三百多年的历史了。虽然她经历了漫长的岁月，但只有在今天才能看出她起了亘古未有的变化，踏上了新生的大道。
    在拉萨，有很多次我漫步在八角街上，到过商店，进过大昭寺，还参观过拉萨的露天商场。在这些地方完全和过去一样，藏民们自由地进进出出，喇嘛们照常在大昭寺里上香磕头。但，当我走进拉萨市新成立的居民委员会，走进藏民们居住的院落里，走进藏民的家里时，我找到了古城的变化和脉搏跳动的地方。
    我刚走进东城一个居民区，看见一个三十开外的藏族妇女在挨门逐户地进行宣传。她名叫格桑。不久前她还是一个贵族的朗生，当了二十几年“下贱人”。在那些被当作牛马、受尽折磨的苦难日子里，格桑自己也认为是“苦命人”，“听天由命”，对自己解放自己毫无信心。现在，她已经认识到了自己的命运再不能让别人来摆布了，应该自己掌握起来，而且她坚决相信，有了共产党，她就有一切。最近她被选为东城区居民委员会的领导人了。前些日子她还列席了西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体委员会议。回来后就积极向广大居民宣传大会关于进行民主改革的各项决议。
    当我从这个居民委员会里走出来时，看到很多的藏族青年和妇女，还有老太太，挟着书包，手里拿着书和写藏文的木板去上文化学校。这些人过去大部分给贵族当佣人，当朗生，今天他们解放了，有些人过去一字不识，现在已经能读藏文报、写藏文书信了。
    在拉萨街头，我看到了藏民们画出的很多大幅彩色新壁画，这里有“王朝的末日”、“叛匪的下场”，也有民族大团结，还有天安门，形形色色，就像百花齐放一样。在拉萨街头，一个叫兼赞的年轻藏族画家，他聚精会神地正在描绘十几幅农奴主逼死农奴的连环画。有一个藏族妇女看着这画竟热泪盈眶，因为她的丈夫被叛匪害死了。
    拉萨过去有很多藏族画家，但在大农奴主的统治下，多少年来，他们只能给贵族粉刷墙壁和染泥菩萨。画家兼赞因为画了一幅毛主席像，曾遭到叛匪的毒打。现在，用兼赞自己的话来说，“自由了。想画什么就画什么”。
    当我走在拉萨街上时，看到很多居民委员会的街道宣传队，抬着毛主席像，打着五星红旗，敲着锣鼓，在街头上演出自己新编的活报剧、翻身舞，向广大的藏民进行民主改革的各项政策宣传。
    过去拉萨街上有很多乞丐，特别是每到传召时期，乞丐就大量的增加，沿着拉萨林廓路多少乞讨的人住在破烂的矮帐篷里，或露宿在街头，周围都是人粪狗屎、垃圾堆，很多人没有糌粑吃，没有蔽体的衣服。自从拉萨地区叛乱平息后，在拉萨军管会的大力救济下，很多乞丐有了饭吃，住上房子，有的还找到了职业。
    白发苍苍、年整八十的藏族老人丹真巴珠，一谈起古城今昔的变化，就兴奋得合不上嘴来。过去他流浪了半辈子无依无靠，没有同情体贴他的人，他经常怨恨自己“老不死”，可是现在，他不但不想早死，而且想活着看到社会主义和共产主义。前几天他生病后，居民委员会就派人去照顾他，给他请医生，扫地、烧茶做饭，还送糌粑、茶叶救济他，左邻右舍的人都跑来看他。这些事，使他感动得不得了，逢人就说：“有了共产党，世道就变了，人与人之间的关系大不相同了。”
    傍晚，当彩霞的红光染遍拉萨河谷平原时，很多居民的院落里传来三弦、琵琶声和欢乐的歌舞声，在人们歌唱新生活的今天也歌唱幸福的明天。
