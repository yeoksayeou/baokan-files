    Congratulating the Opening of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway to Xining
    Just as the whole country is joyously celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the Hekou-Xining section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway has been completed and officially opened to traffic. This is another major victory in socialist economic construction. It also demonstrates the infinite care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province.
    The Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway project was relatively arduous. The 175-kilometer line from Hekou to Xining had to cross the turbulent Yellow River and Datong River, cross the Huangshui River eight times, and pass through the Laoya Gorge tunnel complex. At the beginning of construction, those with right-leaning ideas believed that building bridges during the flood season was impossible. However, under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of workers adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously carried out mass movements and technological revolutions, and promoted the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. They broke the superstition that bridges could not be built during the flood season in history, and finally erected tall piers from the turbulent Yellow River, enabling the entire Hekou-Xining section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway to be completed in just sixteen months. What a high speed this is!
    Qinghai is a vast and resource-rich province, a very lovable part of our motherland. Because there was no railway for a long time in the past, the resources that have been sleeping underground for millions of years could not be developed on a large scale. After the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway opens to traffic to Xining, not only will Qinghai's transportation industry rapidly change its old appearance, but it also signifies the beginning of a larger-scale economic construction in Qinghai Province. Soon, Qinghai Lake, known as a fish storehouse, and the Qaidam oil region, known as an oil storehouse, will become increasingly prosperous with the smooth flow of railway transportation.
    We congratulate all the workers who built the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway for their victorious arrival in Xining, and we wish everyone to make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, and lay the rails to Qaidam and to the Qinghai grasslands! Let the motherland's treasure bowl—the Qaidam Basin—and the vast grasslands be connected to all parts of the country, and let the economy and culture of all ethnic groups in the Qinghai region prosper like other regions of the motherland.

### 祝贺兰青铁路通车西宁

    祝贺兰青铁路通车西宁
    正当举国欢庆建国十周年之际，兰青铁路河口——西宁段已经修通，并且正式开始通车营业了。这是社会主义经济建设中的又一个重大胜利。也表现着党中央和毛主席对青海省各族人民的无限关怀。
    兰青铁路的工程是比较艰巨的，从河口到西宁的一百七十五公里的线路上，要越过奔腾咆哮的黄河和大通河，要八次跨过湟水和穿过老鸦峡隧道群。开工之初，有右倾思想的人认为洪水期间修建大桥是不可能的。但是，广大职工在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动和技术革命，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，破除了历史上洪水期间不能修建大桥的迷信，终于把一个个高大的桥墩从黄河激流中竖立起来，使兰青铁路河口到西宁段工程，在短短的十六个月中全部修通。这是一个多么高的速度！
    青海地大物博，是祖国的一个十分可爱的地方。由于过去长期没有过一寸铁路，千万年来沉眠在地下的资源得不到大规模的开发。兰青铁路通车西宁以后，不仅青海的交通运输事业将迅速改变旧时代的面貌，而且还意味着青海省更大规模经济建设的开始。不久，那号称鱼库的青海湖，那号称油库的柴达木油区，随着铁路运输的畅通必将日趋繁荣。
    我们祝贺修建兰青铁路的全体职工胜利地到达西宁，并祝大家再接再厉，乘胜前进，把铁轨铺到柴达木去，铺到青海草原里去！让祖国的聚宝盆——柴达木盆地和辽阔的草原同全国各地连接起来，让青海地区各民族的经济、文化像祖国其他地区一样地繁荣起来。
