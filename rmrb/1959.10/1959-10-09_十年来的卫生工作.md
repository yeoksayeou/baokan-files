Ten Years of Health Work
Minister of Public Health Li Dequan

Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our people, through ten years of heroic struggle, have achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Over the past decade, the Party and the government, on the basis of ensuring the rapid development of socialist production and construction, have gradually improved and raised the people's material and cultural life and medical and health conditions. Under the leadership of the Party, medical and health departments at all levels, following the guidelines of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, prioritizing prevention, uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and combining health work with mass movements," have carried out enormous work centered on "eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating diseases," greatly changing the face of urban and rural health compared to before liberation, and significantly improving the people's health.

An Unprecedented Patriotic Health Campaign

Before liberation, our people suffered long-term oppression and exploitation by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Various virulent infectious diseases and parasitic diseases were extremely widespread, taking the lives of a large number of working people every year, and countless people lost their ability to work. In severely affected areas, this caused a tragic situation of significant population decline and barren fields. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, health departments at all levels have launched mass patriotic health campaigns nationwide, not only powerfully smashing the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism, but also improving China's sanitary conditions, and training and strengthening the people's strength and confidence in fighting nature in this regard. Based on the development of this movement, the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" promulgated in 1956 clearly proposed the task of eliminating the four pests and eliminating the diseases that are most harmful to the people within twelve years. The great struggle to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eliminate diseases was included in the country's long-term construction plan, and health campaigns were closely integrated with industrial and agricultural production, further serving production. Especially during the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958, the broad masses, with the spirit of "leaving sparrows with no way to fly to heaven, rats with no way to enter the earth, and flies and mosquitoes with no descendants," did everything possible to eliminate a large number of the four pests. Many counties and cities have basically achieved the "four withouts." At the same time, in order to eliminate breeding grounds for the four pests to the greatest extent possible, all localities combined production, fertilizer accumulation, greening, and other tasks to vigorously promote environmental sanitation and collective hygiene, further improving the health of urban and rural areas.

For example, the Wulao Village in Nanjing was covered in sewage and garbage before liberation, and diseases were constantly prevalent, causing great suffering to the people, who called it the "Village of Suffering." Now, the sanitary conditions have been completely renewed, everyone is strong and healthy, and full of vigor. The "Village of Suffering" has become a "Village of Joy." Taiyang Village in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, was always known as the "Village of Plague" before liberation. Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign, the four pests have been basically eliminated, sanitation work has been maintained regularly, and people have developed good hygiene habits, turning the "Village of Plague" into a "Village of Hygiene."

Practice has proven that extensively launching mass patriotic health campaigns and combining the work of medical and health institutions with mass movements is a fundamental policy for large-scale disease prevention and improving people's health. In recent years, thanks to the unremitting efforts of the people and medical workers across the country, coupled with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the incidence of diseases in our country has been greatly reduced. True cholera has long been eradicated, plague, smallpox, and kala-azar have been basically eliminated, schistosomiasis has been basically eliminated in 65% of the epidemic areas, and many counties and cities in the epidemic areas of filariasis and hookworm disease have also been basically eliminated. Malaria epidemic areas have been controlled by 39.5%, and the incidence in other areas has also been greatly reduced. For example, Simao and other counties in Yunnan Province were historically famous malaria-prone areas. Before liberation, the incidence rate reached 80%-90%, but now it has dropped to 0.37%. Especially in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958, the work of eliminating diseases achieved very significant results. The number of schistosomiasis patients treated in that year was equal to three times the number of people treated since liberation; the number of filariasis patients treated was equal to sixteen times the number of people treated since liberation; the number of hookworm disease patients treated was equal to six times the number of people treated since liberation.

Venereal diseases were also a relatively common and very harmful infectious disease left over from old China, especially in border areas inhabited by minority nationalities, seriously threatening the reproduction and development of the population. Now, many areas have basically eliminated current cases of syphilis and gonorrhea, especially in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where the situation has fundamentally changed. For example, in the New Barag Left Banner, the natural population decline rate was 9.4 per thousand due to the impact of venereal diseases in the past. After vigorous prevention and treatment, the population growth rate has risen to 23.3 per thousand.

High temperature, dust, lead, benzene poisoning, etc., are the most serious occupational diseases in factories and mines that endanger the health of workers. Before liberation, although there were very few industrial and mining enterprises, due to the extreme lack of sanitary equipment and harsh working conditions, occupational diseases and occupational poisoning among workers were very serious. After liberation, various factories and mines adopted various labor protection measures and vigorously carried out mass patriotic health campaigns, relying on the strength and wisdom of the workers themselves to improve the sanitary conditions of the factories. By the end of 1958, the dust concentration in the larger factories and mines across the country had been reduced to the standards stipulated by the state, eliminating the threat of silicosis. The incidence of heatstroke has also been rapidly reduced. The number of people suffering from heatstroke in the national steel industry system in 1958 has decreased by 95% compared to 1953. The concentration of benzene in the air in many factories has also been reduced to the standards stipulated by the state, basically controlling benzene poisoning. Other various occupational diseases have also been greatly reduced.

The Victory of the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine

Traditional Chinese medicine is the crystallization of our people's long-term experience in fighting against diseases. It has not only made great contributions in history, but it is still an important weapon for our people to prevent and treat diseases. However, before liberation, the Kuomintang government adopted a reactionary policy of eliminating traditional Chinese medicine, causing the ancestral medical science to be on the verge of interruption. After liberation, especially after the Party Central Committee corrected the bourgeois ideas of some comrades in the health departments who discriminated against and excluded traditional Chinese medicine in 1954, the work of traditional Chinese medicine was greatly developed under the guidance of the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine and inheriting and promoting the legacy of ancestral medicine. By the end of 1958, all localities had launched talent-seeking and folk-customs-collecting movements, many hospitals had established departments of traditional Chinese medicine, and a large number of traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and outpatient clinics had also been established. This allowed the great treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine to be widely explored and applied, and allowed traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, massage, qigong, and other therapies to play a significant role in the fight against diseases. More importantly, Chinese and Western medicine have strengthened unity and cooperation in their joint work, learning from each other, learning from each other's strengths, and greatly improving the treatment effects. For example, in the work of preventing and eliminating schistosomiasis, better results can be achieved for patients in the late stages through the cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine; Chinese and Western medicine cooperated to treat epidemic encephalitis B, adopting a method of mainly using traditional Chinese medicine, supplemented by acupuncture, and assisted by nasal feeding and oxygen infusion, which was not only very effective for patients in the acute phase, but also had better curative effects on sequelae; for the treatment of appendicitis, depending on the changes in the condition, general acute appendicitis can be cured by taking traditional Chinese medicine or using acupuncture therapy. If the condition changes or there are other complications, combined Chinese and Western medicine or surgical treatment can be used to achieve the purpose of cure. In many medical institutions in our country, there have been many facts proving that, according to different diseases, cooperating with the specialties of Chinese and Western medicine can cure certain "incurable diseases." Cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine in medical work has become an important method often used by medical institutions in our country today.

In order to inherit and promote the valuable legacy of ancestral medicine and to organize, study, and improve it using modern scientific methods, the Party and the government have repeatedly emphasized that organizing Western medicine to learn from Chinese medicine is an important key to achieving this goal. According to the Party's instructions, health departments at all levels have launched a movement for Western medicine to learn from Chinese medicine nationwide in recent years. Now, there are a total of thirty Western medicine training classes for off-the-job study of Chinese medicine in the country, with more than 2,100 Western medicine practitioners participating in the study, most of whom are senior or relatively senior Western medicine experts. As for those who study on the job in various ways, the number is even greater. In addition, in order to train new talents in traditional Chinese medicine, the state has also established many traditional Chinese medicine colleges. In 1958, the number of students enrolled reached more than 3,200. There are also more than 52,000 traditional Chinese medicine apprentices who are studying with teachers.

In terms of research on traditional Chinese medicine, in addition to the establishment of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the central government, most provinces and cities have also successively established specialized research institutions. These research institutions cooperate closely with medical and health, medical education, and other medical science research institutions, and have made meaningful progress. The National Academic Symposium on Meridians and Acupuncture of Traditional Chinese Medicine held in Shanghai in July this year is a very good proof. At this academic symposium, a total of 391 academic papers were received from 120 units across the country. These academic papers have carried out preliminary organization and research on the efficacy or mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of appendicitis, infantile paralysis, deafness and muteness, hypertension, neuralgia, rheumatic arthritis, neurasthenia, enuresis, and other diseases in recent years. For example, the "Report on the Efficacy and Mechanism of Acupuncture Treatment of Appendicitis" made by the Shanghai Acupuncture Treatment of Appendicitis Research Collaboration Group shows that acupuncture has the best effect on simple appendicitis, pain disappears quickly after acupuncture, body temperature and white blood cells drop quickly; and it is found that bowel sounds, intestinal peristalsis, appendiceal emptying, and phagocytic index increase after acupuncture. These phenomena preliminarily show that acupuncture has the effect of promoting the body's defense function. This fully proves that there are a large number of scientific essences in the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine in our country, and we should seriously absorb these essences. This is a necessary condition for the development of our country's new school of medicine. At the same time, it further proves that the Party's policy of organizing research on our country's medical heritage using modern scientific methods is completely correct.

Continue the Great Leap Forward under the Leadership of the Party

All the achievements made in health work over the past decade are fundamentally the victory of the Party's leadership and the victory of the Party's general line of building socialism. We deeply realize that "of all the thousands of things, the Party's leadership comes first," and the Party will always be the lighthouse in all our work. As long as we listen to the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and act in accordance with the spirit of the general line, we will be able to continuously achieve brilliant victories. In our health departments, after rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, the Party's leadership has been firmly established, and all work has shown vitality. When the Party's general line was put forward, it was immediately accepted by the broad masses and transformed into a huge material force, resulting in a vigorous new situation of the Great Leap Forward, which has greatly developed our health cause. At present, there are some people in our team whose bourgeois ideas have not been completely transformed, and Right-leaning conservative ideas have begun to rise again, and Right-leaning activities have begun to appear. They gesticulate and oppose the Great Leap Forward in health work, attack the people's communes, and oppose the general line. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose Right-leaning tendencies, encourage hard work, resolutely implement the general line, continue to leap forward in health work, and strive for greater victories.

The fundamental task of health work is to vigorously carry out mass campaigns to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eliminate diseases. It is wrong to regard health work merely as a purely technical work for a small number of people. To do a good job in health work, we must fully mobilize the masses, rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses, rely on mass movements, and resolutely implement the Party's mass line policy. We must resolutely implement a series of "walking on two legs" policies, such as combining specialized talents with the broad masses, combining health with production, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and combining prevention and treatment. This is the correct path for health work to implement the general line of socialist construction, and it is also an important way to quickly transform the Chinese people from being weak to strong and from being backward to advanced. Of course, specialized talents play a very important role in eliminating diseases. Various specialized technical talents, as long as they can go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, hand over technical knowledge to the broad masses, fully trust the wisdom and strength of the masses, become one with the masses, and constantly learn from the masses, can achieve great achievements.

Adhering to uniting all the staff on the entire medical and health front and mobilizing all their positive factors to serve socialist construction is an important key to doing a good job in health work. Due to the historical characteristics of our country, Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, ethnic minority medicine, herbal medicine, and many medical talents with unique skills have been formed in our medical and health team. They jointly undertake the medical and health work of 650 million people in our country, especially the Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine which control two different medical academics, have greater responsibilities. Faced with such arduous and glorious tasks, all medical personnel should, under the leadership of the Party, closely unite and fully cooperate. Differences in academic viewpoints should be resolved through mutual learning, free discussion, and serious scientific practice in accordance with the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. No one should stick to their old ways, everyone should learn new things, and academic disputes should be subordinated to political unity. All medical and health personnel should, under the leadership of the Party, on the basis of taking the socialist road and serving the people, strive to eliminate the four pests in all possible places in the near future, gradually eliminate the diseases that are most harmful to the people, and greatly improve the level of our country's health cause.

    十年来的卫生工作
    卫生部部长　李德全
    我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过十年来的英勇奋斗，已经取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。十年来，党与政府在保证社会主义生产建设迅速发展的基础上，逐步改善和提高了人民的物质文化生活和医药卫生条件，各级医药卫生部门在党的领导下，遵循着“面向工农兵、预防为主、团结中西医、卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的方针，以“除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病”为中心，进行了巨大的工作，使城乡卫生面貌比解放前大大改观，人民健康水平有了显著提高。
    史无前例的除害灭病运动
    解放前，我们人民长期受着帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削。各种烈性传染病、寄生虫病流行极广，年年有大量劳动人民被夺去了生命，无数人丧失了劳动力；严重的地区，造成了人口显著下降，田园荒芜的凄惨景象。解放以来，各级卫生部门在党的领导下，在全国范围内大搞群众卫生运动，不仅有力地粉碎了美帝国主义的细菌战，同时也改善了我国的卫生状况，锻炼和增强了人民在这一方面向自然作斗争的力量和信心。在这一运动发展的基础上，1956年公布的农业发展纲要（草案），更明确提出了十二年内消灭四害和消灭危害人民最大的疾病的任务。把除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的伟大斗争列入国家建设的长远规划，使卫生运动与工农业生产密切结合起来，进一步为生产服务。尤其在1958年的大跃进和人民公社化运动中广大群众以“让麻雀上天无路，让老鼠入地无门，让苍蝇、蚊子断子绝孙”的气概，千方百计地消灭了大量的四害，许多县、市已经基本上实现了四无。同时，为了在一切可能的范围内清除四害孳生场所，各地都结合生产、积肥、绿化等项工作，大搞环境卫生和集体卫生，进一步改善了城乡的卫生面貌。
    例如，南京市的五老村，解放前污水、垃圾遍布，疾病不断流行，人民不堪其苦，称之为“苦恼村”。现在卫生面貌焕然一新，人人身强体壮，精神焕发，“苦恼村”变成了“欢乐村”。山西省稷山县太阳村，解放前一向被称为“瘟疫村”，从爱国卫生运动开展以来，基本消灭了四害，卫生工作保持经常化，人们养成了良好的卫生习惯，使“瘟疫村”变成了“卫生村”。
    实践证明：广泛开展群众卫生运动，把医疗卫生机构的工作同群众运动结合起来，是大规模防治疾病增进人民健康的一项根本政策。几年来，由于全国人民和医务工作者坚持不懈的努力。再加上苏联和其他社会主义国家的援助，我国的疾病发病率已经大为降低。真性霍乱早已绝迹，鼠疫、天花、黑热病基本上已被消灭，血吸虫病已在65％的流行地区基本被消灭，丝虫病、钩虫病的流行地区，也有许多县市已经基本消灭。疟疾流行区已有39.5％被控制，其他地区的发病率也已大大降低，如云南省思茅等县是历史上有名的高疟区，解放前发病率达80％—90％，现已下降到0.37％。特别是在1958年全面大跃进中，灭病工作获得了非常巨大的成果，这一年治疗血吸虫病患者等于解放以来治疗人数的三倍；治疗丝虫病患者等于解放以来治疗人数的十六倍；治疗钩虫病患者等于解放以来治疗人数的六倍。
    性病也是旧中国遗留下来比较普遍的危害很大的一种传染病，特别是在边疆少数民族地区，严重地威胁着人口的繁衍和发展。现在，很多地区的现症梅毒和淋病已基本消灭，尤其是内蒙古自治区的情况已有根本的改变，如新巴尔虎左翼旗，过去由于性病的影响，人口自然下降率为千分之九点四，在大力防治后，人口增长率已上升到千分之二十三点三。
    高温、粉尘、铅、苯中毒等是工矿中危害工人健康最为严重的职业病。解放前，工矿企业虽然很少，但由于卫生设备奇缺，劳动条件恶劣，因而工人的职业病和职业中毒十分严重。解放后，各厂矿采取了各种劳动保护措施，并大搞群众卫生运动，依靠工人群众自己的力量和智慧，改善工厂的卫生条件，到1958年底，全国较大的厂矿粉尘浓度已降低到国家规定的标准，解除了矽尘的威胁。中暑发生率也已迅速降低，全国钢铁工业系统中暑人数1958年已较1953年减少了95％。很多工厂中空气含苯浓度也已降低到国家规定的标准，基本控制了苯中毒。其他各种职业病也都大大的减少了。
    党的中医政策的胜利
    祖国医药学是我国人民长期同疾病作斗争的经验结晶，它不但在历史上有过巨大的贡献，而且至今仍是我国人民赖以防治疾病的重要武器。但在解放以前，由于国民党政府采取了消灭中医的反动政策，致使祖国医学濒于中断。解放以后，特别是1954年党中央纠正了卫生部门中若干同志歧视、排斥中医的资产阶级思想以后，中医中药工作在党的团结中西医、继承发扬祖国医学遗产的政策指导下，有了很大的进展。到1958年底，各地都开展了访贤运动和采风运动，许多医院设立了中医科，另外还建立了大批的中医医院和中医门诊部。使祖国医药学的伟大宝库，得到了广泛的发掘和应用，使中医中药、针灸、推拿、气功等疗法，在防治疾病的斗争中发挥了很大的作用。更重要的是，中西医在共同工作中加强了团结合作，互相学习，取长补短，大大提高了治疗效果。如在防治和消灭血吸虫病的工作中，经过中西医合作，对于晚期患者，就可取得更好的效果；中西医合作治疗流行性乙型脑炎，采取了中医中药为主，配合针灸，并以鼻饲、输氧为辅的疗法，不仅对急性期病人的疗效很好，而且对后遗症也有较好的疗效；治疗阑尾炎，根据病情的变化，对一般急性阑尾炎，服用中药或用针灸疗法，即可治愈，如病情发生了变化或有其他合并症，则采取中西药兼用或手术疗法，都可达到治愈的目的。在我国的许多医疗机构中，已经有不少事实证明，根据不同疾病用中西医的专长合作治疗，可以使某些“不治之症”得以治愈。中西医合作进行医疗工作，已成为当前我国医疗机构常常采用的重要方法。
    为了继承和发扬祖国医药学的宝贵遗产，并用现代科学的方法加以整理、研究和提高，党和政府一再强调指出组织西医学习中医是达到这一目的的重要关键。各级卫生部门根据党的指示，几年来，在全国范围内，开展了西医学习中医的运动，现在全国离职学习中医的西医班共有三十个，参加学习的西医达二千一百余人，其中大多数是高级或较高级的西医专家。至于用各种方式进行在职学习的人为数更多。此外，为了培养新的中医人材，国家还举办了许多中医院校，1958年在校人数已达三千二百余人。另有五万二千多中医学徒，正在随师学习。
    在中医药的研究方面，除中央建立了中医研究院外，多数省市也相继建立了专门的研究机构，这些研究机构和医疗卫生、医学教育以及其他医学科学研究机构密切合作，已经取得了有意义的进展。今年7月在上海召开的全国中医经络、针灸学术座谈会，就是很好的证明。在这次学术座谈会上，共收到全国一百二十个单位的学术论文三百九十一篇。这些学术论文，对近年来针灸治疗阑尾炎、小儿麻痹、聋哑、高血压、神经痛、风湿性关节炎、神经衰弱、遗尿症等疾病的疗效或机制进行了初步的整理和研究。如上海市针灸治疗阑尾炎研究协作小组所作的“针灸治疗阑尾炎疗效及作用机制的报告”，说明了针刺对单纯阑尾炎的疗效最好，针刺后疼痛迅速消失，体温和白血球很快下降；并且发现针刺后肠鸣、肠蠕动增强、阑尾排空以及噬菌指数增高等现象。这些现象初步说明针刺有促进机体的防御机能的作用。这样就充分证明了在我国中医药学遗产里面，有大量的具有科学性的精华，我们应该把这些精华认真地加以吸取。这是发展我国新的医药学派的必要条件。同时更证明了党所指出的运用现代科学方法整理研究我国医学遗产的方针是完全正确的。
    在党的领导下继续大跃进
    十年来，卫生工作所取得的一切成就，归根到底是党的领导的胜利，是党的建设社会主义的总路线的胜利。我们深深体会到“千条万条，党的领导第一条”，党永远是我们一切工作中的灯塔。只要听党的话，坚持政治挂帅，按照总路线的精神办事，就能够不断地取得辉煌的胜利。在我们卫生部门中，经过整风、反右斗争之后，党的领导巩固地树立起来了，一切工作都显出了生气，当党的总路线一提出来，立刻就为广大群众所接受，转化为巨大的物质力量，出现了蓬蓬勃勃地大跃进的新局面，使我们的卫生事业得到了空前大发展。现在，在我们的队伍中有一些资产阶级思想未得到彻底改造的人，右倾保守思想又有所抬头，右倾活动又有显现，他们指手划脚反对卫生工作的大跃进，攻击人民公社，反对总路线，因此，我们必须坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会决议的精神，反右倾，鼓干劲，坚决贯彻总路线，在卫生工作中继续跃进，争取更大的胜利。
    卫生工作的根本任务是大力开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的群众运动。把卫生工作仅仅看作是少数人的单纯技术性的工作是不对的。做好卫生工作必须充分发动群众，依靠群众的力量和智慧，依靠群众运动和坚决执行党的群众路线的方针，坚决贯彻专门人才与广大群众相结合，卫生与生产相结合，中医和西医相结合，预防和治疗相结合等一系列“两条腿走路”的方针。这是卫生工作贯彻社会主义建设总路线的正确道路，也是使我国人民迅速转病弱为强健，转落后为先进的重要途径。当然，专门人材在消灭疾病中有很重大的作用，各种专门技术人才，只要能够深入实际，深入群众，把技术知识交给广大群众，充分信赖群众的智慧与力量，同群众打成一片并经常地向群众学习，就能获得重大的成就。
    坚持团结整个医药卫生战线上的全体工作人员，调动他们的一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务，是做好卫生工作的重要关键。由于我国历史的特点，在我们医药卫生队伍中形成有西医、中医，还有少数民族医、草药医及许多具有一技之长的医药人材，他们共同担负着我国六亿五千万人民的医疗保健工作，特别是掌握着两个不同医药学术的为数很大的西医和中医，责任更为重大。面对着这样艰巨光荣的任务，所有医药人员应当在党的领导下，亲密团结、充分合作。学术观点上的分歧，应该根据党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，用相互学习、自由讨论的方法，并且通过认真的科学实践去解决。任何人都不应当故步自封，任何人都应当学习新的事物，学术问题的争论应当服从政治上的团结，所有医药卫生人员应当在党的领导下，在走社会主义道路和为人民服务的基础上，为争取在最近几年内，在一切可能的地方除尽四害，逐步消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，把我国卫生事业的水平大大提高一步而共同奋斗。
