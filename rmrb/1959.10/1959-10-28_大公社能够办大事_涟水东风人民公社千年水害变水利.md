    The People's Commune Can Do Great Things
    ——LianShui Dongfeng People's Commune Transforms a Thousand Years of Water Calamity into Water Conservancy
    The Dongfeng Commune is located north of the town of Lianshui County, Jiangsu Province. The soil here is very poor, with about one-third being saline-alkali land. When exposed to the sun, it effloresces with saltpetre, making it difficult for crops to sprout. The masses call it "mottled bald land" and "tattered sheepskin coat land." The terrain is high in the south and low in the north, with the Yan River running through it. Before liberation, water conservancy conditions were extremely poor, making it prone to both floods and droughts. In particular, the more than 50,000 mu of land in the north was known as the "bottom of the pot depression" and "water storage pond," with harvests failing nine years out of ten. In the past, this area had a Yue'an Township, and Yue'an Township had a Yu Village. There was a saying among the masses: "Yue'an is 'ever flooded,' even a frog's pee can cause a flood," "Yu Village, Yu Village, four waters pour into the pond, a rainstorm, and the whole place is a sea of water, the land is barren and the people are poor, nine out of ten years are barren, hard work is hopeless, leaving home and fleeing from famine." These folk rhymes truthfully recorded the water disasters and the poor living conditions of the people in those years.
    Since liberation, especially after cooperativization, the local masses, under the leadership of the Party and the government, have built water conservancy projects year after year, which has increased production and improved living conditions. However, the scale of the agricultural cooperatives at that time was small, with limited funds and insufficient labor. They could only dig some small ditches and were unable to build larger water conservancy projects. Moreover, the small size of the cooperatives and the large number of units made it difficult to unify the planning of water conservancy projects, often resulting in each doing their own thing. Even if there was a unified engineering plan, the participating units often disagreed with each other because the amount of wasted land varied, and the benefits were different. In particular, there were many contradictions between upstream and downstream units. The units upstream, in order to ensure smooth drainage, demanded that the ditches be built larger and more numerous; the units downstream, however, were afraid that "burning more paper attracts more ghosts, digging more rivers attracts more water," advocating for small-scale and less construction. Some two cooperatives dug the same ditch, but the cooperative downstream was unwilling to connect the upstream and downstream sections of the canal, resulting in "an inch not connected, ten thousand feet of failure." In the high tide of water conservancy construction from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, agricultural cooperatives strengthened their cooperation, and the amount of earthwork completed greatly exceeded that of previous years. However, the cooperation between cooperatives was still subject to certain limitations, and the constructed projects were still of very low standards, failing to achieve the goal of fundamentally eliminating waterlogging. Moreover, the rainfall in 1958 was unprecedentedly concentrated, and the crops of twelve agricultural cooperatives were flooded, with an average annual grain yield of only 154 jin.
    As soon as the Dongfeng Commune was established, the Commune Party Committee, under the direct leadership of the County Party Committee, began from the autumn harvest and autumn planting of 1958 to the wheat harvest of 1959, a period of eight months, to build a river network project that transformed a thousand years of water disasters into water conservancy in the 37 square kilometers of Wangji, Panliu, Hanchen, Yuzhuang, and Juntian five brigades with low-lying terrain. This project was of a high standard, meeting the requirement of "guaranteed irrigation without rain for one year, and no waterlogging even with 500 millimeters of rain per day." The scale of the project was huge, with channels divided into five levels: main, branch, bucket, farm, and capillary. On the west side was the irrigation main canal, on the east side was the Gongxing River for drainage, and in the middle were three east-west irrigation branch canals and three parallel drainage ditches. The large ditches were 40 meters wide at the surface, 8 meters wide at the bottom, and 6 meters deep, with a distance of 3,200 meters between the canals; the north-south distance was 1,000 meters. There were 135 east-west irrigation farm canals and parallel drainage ditches, with the small ditches 2 meters wide at the surface, 1 meter wide at the bottom, and 2 meters deep, with a distance of 200 meters between the canals; in addition, there were countless small capillary channels extending into the fields. The branch, bucket, and farm-level irrigation canals and the large, medium, and small-level drainage ditches were 458 kilometers long. All engineering specifications were uniform, aligned horizontally and vertically, with dikes built on the canals, roads built on the dikes, trees planted along the roads, ditches connected to ditches, canals connected to canals, dikes connected to dikes, roads connected to roads, forming a checkerboard-like drainage network, irrigation network, road network, and shelterbelt network.
    The People's Commune demonstrated its great superiority in the river network project. Because the commune uniformly allocated and rationally arranged the labor force of the entire commune, carried out cooperation between brigades, and established large canteens, enabling the broad masses of women to be freed from household labor, the entire commune mobilized and organized 11,000 people to participate in the river network project, accounting for more than 60% of the total labor force. Women accounted for more than half of all the migrant workers, which had never happened before. Under the banner of communist cooperation, fraternal communes mobilized 20,000 people to support for 40 days. On the production front, the commune mobilized more than 5,000 auxiliary laborers to participate in lighter labor such as picking cotton and organized the brigades to support each other. For example, the Fanbu Brigade had a large cotton field area, and the Dongfeng, Zhangma, and other brigades mobilized more than 1,500 people to help them pick cotton; the Chengdong Brigade had 480 mu of large firewood that had not been cut, and the Chengbei and Zhabei brigades sent more than 180 people to help harvest. In addition, residents and cadres of Lianshui Town also frequently participated in labor in the commune. As a result, the smooth progress of the river network project was guaranteed, and the tasks of the autumn harvest and autumn planting were also completed very well.
    Raising the equipment and materials needed for the river network project was also an arduous task. The auxiliary buildings of the entire project required more than 4.5 million blue bricks, 100 cubic meters of rubble, more than 260 cubic meters of yellow sand, more than 50,000 jin of lime, more than 30 tons of cement, more than 160 cement pipes, more than 1.2 million jin of wood... with a total value of more than 300,000 yuan. If the five brigades in the river network area were to bear the burden, each household would have to contribute an average of about 150 yuan, and most of the equipment would have to be solved through self-reliance. This would have been difficult for agricultural cooperatives in the past, but the "large and public" People's Commune solved these problems more smoothly than before. On the one hand, the commune mobilized its members to invest; on the other hand, it established brick kilns, lime kilns, and earthen cement kilns to produce on its own, ensuring the supply of equipment and materials.
    During the construction process, many difficulties were encountered: continuous rain, quicksand up to one meter deep, frozen soil as hard as iron.... Under the leadership of the Commune Party Committee, the heroic migrant workers displayed a high degree of initiative and overcame these difficulties one by one. The river network project was finally completed on schedule according to the plan. At the same time, some small canals were also built, excavating a total of more than 600,000 cubic meters of earth, which far exceeded any previous year.
    The smooth completion of the river network project gave all the members a profound education in the superiority of communization. Those who once did not believe that the river network could be completed also saw the great power of the People's Commune. Zhu Jingnian of the Meiman Team of the Hanchen Brigade wrote a jingle at the beginning of the project: "The standard is frightening, eight generations cannot carry it out, if you want to complete it, unless people become gods." Now he says: "It seems that the People's Commune is really a god!" "Without communization, there would be no river network!" This is the unanimous discussion of the members of the Dongfeng People's Commune.
    Great efforts have brought great gains. The realization of the river network has basically eliminated the water disasters in the seventeen brigades north of the Yan River. On July 15, 1959, there was 183 millimeters of rainfall in one day, and on August 30 and 31, there was 220 millimeters of rainfall in two days. These were two tests of the effectiveness of the project. What was the result? In the Chaishi Brigade, which has a higher terrain, it used to take three days for the water to recede from the fields when the daily rainfall reached 100 millimeters; this year, the fields were dry after the rain stopped, and the production captain notified the members to go to the fields to work the day after the rain. In the Yuzhuang Brigade, which has the lowest terrain, the masses used to say, "The heavens do not help, they only send begging sticks" whenever there was a rainstorm before liberation; in the years after liberation, the members said that it was "sending relief funds" whenever there was a rainstorm; but the two rains in 1959 did not bring any losses to this brigade. The members said: "The heavens are raining grain" and "raining gold."
    The realization of the river network has enabled 36% of the cultivated land in the entire commune to be irrigated by gravity flow, creating conditions for converting dry land to paddy fields. When the gurgling water first flowed into the paddy fields through the canals at all levels, the members were overjoyed, vying to watch and exclaiming: "Now we really have no worries about drought or flood!" More than one million trees have been planted on the river dikes in the river network area, of which 500,000 are transplanted large trees. Eleven rows of trees have been planted on each dike of the branch canals and bucket canals, six rows of trees have been planted on the dikes of the farm canals, and willows and oil grasses have also been planted on the dikes of the capillary canals, lush and green, looking like green dragons from a distance.
    "The People's Commune can do great things," this is the evaluation of the People's Commune made by the members of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Lianshui County based on their personal experience. In the short year after its establishment, the Dongfeng Commune has done many major things that the agricultural cooperatives in the past did not have the strength to do. In the 37 square kilometers of the five northern brigades, a high-standard river network project has been built; a quarter of the cultivated land has been converted from dry land to paddy fields, and ten thousand mu of low-lying land has been transformed into granaries. A major adjustment has been made to the crop layout, enabling the land to be used more rationally. Four tractors have been purchased, and 26% of the cultivated area has been mechanized. The first hydropower station has been built. As a result of doing these major things, the per-mu yield and total output of grain in 1959 will be double that of 1958. The average income of the members will increase by more than 50% compared with 1958. The members' confidence in running the commune has become more firm, and the Dongfeng Commune is advancing by leaps and bounds on the road of consolidation and soundness.

    大公社能够办大事
    ——涟水东风人民公社千年水害变水利
    东风公社在江苏省涟水县城的北面。这里土质很坏，约有三分之一是盐碱地，太阳一晒，就冒盐硝，种庄稼很难立苗。群众称它是“花斑秃子地”、“破羊皮袄地”。地势南高北洼，盐河横贯其中。解放前，水利条件极差，易涝易旱。尤其是北部的五万多亩土地是出名的“锅底洼”、“水囤子”，十年九不收。以前这块地方有个悦安乡，悦安乡有个余庄，群众中流传着：“悦安‘越淹’，青蛙撒泡尿就要淹”，“余庄余庄，四水投塘，一场暴雨，遍地汪洋，地薄民贫，十年九荒，辛辛苦苦没指望，离乡背井去逃荒”。这些歌谣，真实地记载了当年的水患和人民生活贫困的状况。
    解放以来，特别是合作化以后，当地群众在党和政府的领导下，连年兴修水利，使生产有了增长，生活也有了改善。但是，当时的农业社规模小，资金少，劳力不足，只能挖一些小沟，无力兴修较大的水利工程。而且社小单位多，水利工程不易统一规划，往往是各干各的；即使有了统一的工程计划，参加施工的单位，也常常因为挖废土地有多有少、受益有大有小而互不一致。特别是上下游之间矛盾很多，处在上游的单位为了泄水通畅，要求把沟渠修大些，修多些；处在下游的单位却怕“烧纸多引鬼多，挑河多引水多”，主张小修少修。有的两个社同挖一条沟，处在下游的社却不愿把上下游两节渠道挖通，结果形成“一丈不通，万丈无功”。在1957年冬到1958年春的水利建设高潮中，农业社之间加强了协作，完成的土方量大大超过往年。但是，社与社之间的协作毕竟受到一定限制，所建工程仍然标准很低，未能达到根治涝害的目的。而1958年雨量又空前集中，十二个农业社的庄稼被淹，粮食平均年产量只有一百五十四斤。
    东风公社一成立，公社党委就在县委直接领导下，从1958年秋收秋种前开始到1959年麦收前为止的八个月时间内，在地势低洼的王集、潘刘、韩陈、余庄和军田五个大队三十七平方公里的范围内，兴建了一项化千年水害为水利的河网化工程。这项工程是高标准的，达到“一年无雨保灌溉，日雨五百毫米不受涝”的要求。工程的规模是巨大的，渠道分干、支、斗、农、毛五级。西边是灌溉干渠，东边是排涝的公兴河，中间有东西向灌溉支渠和并列的排水大沟各三条。大沟面宽四十米，底宽八米，深六米，渠与渠的间距为三千二百米；南北的间距为一千米。东西向灌溉农渠和并列的排水小沟各一百三十五条，小沟面宽二米，底宽一米，深二米，渠与渠的间距为二百米；此外，还有深入田间、难以胜数的小毛渠。支、斗、农三级灌溉渠道和大、中、小三级排水沟全长四百五十八公里。全部工程规格一律，横竖对齐，渠上筑堤，堤上筑路，路旁植树，沟连沟，渠通渠，堤接堤，路通路，形成了棋盘式的排水网、灌溉网、道路网、林带网。
    人民公社在河网化工程中显示了巨大的优越性。由于公社对全社劳动力进行了统一调配与合理安排，在大队之间开展了协作，并且大办食堂，使广大妇女摆脱家务劳动，全公社就动员组织了一万一千人参加河网化工程，占劳动力总数的60％以上。在全部民工中，妇女要占一半以上，这是从来没有过的事情。在共产主义大协作的旗帜下，兄弟公社动员两万人前来支援了四十天。在生产战线上，公社发动了五千多个辅助劳动力参加拾棉花等较轻的劳动，并且组织各大队相互支援。例如樊卜大队棉田面积大，东风、张码等几个大队就动员一千五百多人帮助他们拾棉花；城东大队有四百八十亩大柴未砍，城北、闸北两个大队就出动一百八十多人帮助收割。此外，涟城镇居民和机关干部也经常到公社参加劳动。这样做的结果，保证了河网化工程的顺利进行，秋收秋种的任务也完成得很好。
    筹集河网化工程所需要的器材物资也是一项艰巨的任务。整个工程的附属建筑物需用青砖四百五十多万块，块石一百方，黄砂二百六十多方，石灰五万多斤，水泥三十多吨，水泥管一百六十多个，木料一百二十多万斤……总值在三十万元以上。如果由河网化地区的五个大队负担，平均每户要摊到一百五十元左右，大部分器材又要自力更生来解决。这在过去农业社是很难办到的，但是，“一大二公”的人民公社办起来解决这些问题就比以前顺利了。公社一方面发动社员投资；另一方面建立了砖窑、石灰窑和土水泥窑，自行生产，保证了器材的供应。
    施工过程中还碰到了不少困难：连绵不断的阴雨，深达一米的流沙，硬得像铁的冻土……。英雄的民工们在公社党委的领导下，发挥了高度的积极性，把这些困难一个又一个地克服了。河网化工程，终于按照计划如期完成了。同时，还兴修了一些小渠道，一共挖土六十多万方，也远远超过了过去任何一年。
    河网化工程顺利完成，使全体社员受到了一次深刻的公社化优越性的教育。那些曾经不相信河网化能搞成的人，也看到了人民公社的巨大威力。韩陈大队美满小队的朱井年在工程开始时编了一首顺口溜：“标准吓死人，八辈挑不成，要想扒成功，除非人变神。”现在他说：“看来大公社还就是神呢？”“没有公社化，就没有河网化！”这就是东风人民公社社员们异口同声的议论。
    巨大的努力，带来了巨大的收获，实现了河网化，使盐河以北的十七个大队基本上根治了水患。1959年7月15日一天降雨一百八十三毫米，8月30日、31日两天降雨二百二十毫米，这是对工程效果的两次考验。结果怎样呢？地势较高的柴市大队，过去日雨量达到一百毫米，田间积水要三天才能退尽；今年则雨住田干，雨后第二天，生产队长就通知社员下田干活了。地势最洼的余庄大队，解放前每逢暴雨，群众就说：“老天不帮衬，专下讨饭棍”；解放后的几年，每逢暴雨，社员就说是“下救济款”；可是1959年两场雨，并没有给这个大队带来任何损失，社员说：“老天下的是粮食”、“下的是金子”。
    实现了河网化，全公社36％的耕地得到了自流灌溉，为旱地改水田创造了条件。当潺潺的流水，通过各级渠道第一次流入稻田的时候，社员们欣喜若狂，争先观看，赞叹说：“这下真是旱涝无忧了！”在河网化地区，河堤上已经栽种了一百多万株树木，其中有五十万株是移栽的大树。支渠和斗渠堤各植树十一排，农渠堤植树六排，毛渠堤上也栽上了?柳和油草，郁郁葱葱，远看好像一条条青龙。
    “大公社能够办大事”，这是涟水县东风人民公社的社员们，根据切身体会对人民公社作出的评价。东风公社在成立后的短短一年中，办了许多过去农业社没有力量办到的大事情。在北部五个大队三十七平方公里的范围内，建成了高标准的河网化工程；四分之一的耕地实行了旱改水，万亩洼地变成了粮仓。作物布局进行了大调整，使土地能够更合理地利用。买了四台拖拉机，有26％的耕地面积实行了机耕。建立了第一座水力发电站。由于办了以上这些大事，1959年粮食的单产和总产都将比1958年翻一番。社员的平均收入将比1958年增加50％以上。社员办社的信心更加坚定了，东风公社在巩固的健全的道路上大踏步地前进着。
