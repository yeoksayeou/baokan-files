Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th: The hundred thousand iron and steel workers of Chongqing achieved initial victory in the October steel production battle. From the 1st to the 5th, compared with September, which had the highest steel output this year, the city's average daily steel output increased by 1.77%, steel materials increased by 27.44%, and pig iron increased by 28.74%.

Since National Day, the city's iron and steel warriors have been full of vigor and high spirits. Every steel plant has launched a "Red in the First Furnace, First Shift, and First Week of October" competition for high quality and high yield. Zheng Xingwan, a famous fast desulfurization expert from No. 1 open-hearth furnace in Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's open-hearth furnace workshop, first set a record of refining a furnace of steel in six minutes and forty-seven seconds on the first shift of the first day of National Day. Workers at No. 2 furnace then exceeded their competition opponent with a time of five minutes and fifty seconds. In the full-red competition launched by the workers of the large rolling mill and the medium and small rolling mills of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, eleven new records have been created in the past five days.

On the basis of winning the initial victory, all steel plants in the city are confidently advancing and striving for an all-red month of production in October, in order to "ensure the four seasons with October, and the whole year with the four seasons," and guarantee the early completion of this year's annual steel production plan.
