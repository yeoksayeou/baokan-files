　　“Because Poland and China are one family”
    The "Will" Diesel Engine Factory in Warsaw has a close relationship with China, with a quarter of its total production dedicated to our country. As our country celebrates the tenth anniversary of its founding, all 3,500 employees of the factory are also celebrating the great festival of the Chinese people.

    Comrade Agashti, the factory director, enthusiastically told us: "This year, our factory is producing 300 diesel engines and 38 diesel generators for China. We regard producing orders for China as our number one task in our work. In order to support the needs of our brotherly Chinese people in construction, we have overcome various difficulties and delivered 200 diesel engines ahead of schedule, and we are working hard to ship the rest to China before the end of this year." The factory party secretary, Jie Zimnoski, added, "All the workers in the factory know that they are producing for China, and their enthusiasm is very high. They all say that we are producing for our Chinese brothers, so we must guarantee the quality."

    Because all the workers in the factory participated in the production of diesel engines for China, they feel particularly close to China. The workers closely follow the news of the continuous Great Leap Forward from China through newspapers and magazines, and are encouraged by the achievements of China's socialist construction.

    When we visited the workshop, we could see a busy atmosphere of intense operation everywhere. The engineers accompanying us and the workers in the workshop pointed to the diesel engines being made and equipped one by one and said: "This is ready to be shipped to China." This sentence has become synonymous with Sino-Polish friendship in the workshop. In the inspection workshop, fourteen diesel generators roared deafeningly. This is the last process before the machine leaves the factory—testing. Inspector Skibu said happily, louder than the motor's roar: "These fourteen diesel generators are all for you, and they will leave the factory in two or three days." Skibu added: "The People's Republic of China is celebrating its tenth anniversary. Workers are constantly talking about China now, and we are very happy with the achievements of the Chinese people's Great Leap Forward. In order to celebrate the Chinese people's festival, we must do a better job in production, because Poland and China are one family."

　　“因为波兰中国是一家”
    华沙“意志”柴油机工厂和中国有着亲密的关系，它的全部产品的四分之一是为我国生产的。在我国庆祝建国十周年的节日里，全厂三千五百名职工也在欢庆中国人民的伟大节日。
    厂长阿格斯蒂同志热情地向我们说：“今年我厂为中国生产三百台柴油发动机，三十八台柴油发电机。我们把为中国生产订货看作是工作中的第一号任务。我们为了支援兄弟的中国人民建设上的需要，克服种种困难，提前交出了二百台柴油机，正努力争取在今年年底前把其余部分运往中国。”工厂党委书记洁兹姆诺斯基接着补充说，“全厂工人都知道是为中国生产，情绪非常高。他们都说，我们是为中国兄弟生产的，一定要保证质量。”
    由于全厂工人都参加了为中国生产柴油机的工作，所以对中国特别感到亲切。工人们通过报刊密切注视着不断从中国传来的生产大跃进的消息，并为中国社会主义建设的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    当我们参观车间时，处处可以看到一片紧张操作的忙碌气氛，陪同我们参观的工程师和车间里的工人们指着一个个正在制作和装备的柴油发动机说：“这是准备运往中国的。”这句话在车间里成了表示中波友好的代名词。在检验车间里，十四部柴油发电机发出震耳欲聋的轰鸣声，这是机器出厂前的最后一道工序——试验。检验工斯基布用高过马达轰鸣声高兴的说：“这十四部柴油发电机都是给你们的，再有两三天就要出厂了。”斯基布又说：“中华人民共和国建国十周年了，工人们现在不断谈论中国，我们对中国人民大跃进的成就十分高兴。为了庆祝中国人民的节日，我们要把生产搞的更好，因为波兰中国是一家。”
