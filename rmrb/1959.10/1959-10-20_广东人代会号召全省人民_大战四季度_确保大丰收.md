Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 16th: The Second Session of the Second Guangdong Provincial People's Congress called on the people of the province to fight vigorously in the fourth quarter to ensure a bumper grain harvest, and strive to complete the annual industrial production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule.

The meeting was held in Guangzhou from the 4th to the 11th. The heads of various departments of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, the deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Guangzhou, members of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao who came to Guangzhou to attend the National Day celebrations attended the meeting.

Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. Tao Zhu cited many facts and sternly refuted the slanders of the right-leaning opportunists against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement. He pointed out that the practice of the past year or so has proved that the Party's General Line is completely correct, and the implementation of the Party's General Line has greatly accelerated the speed of socialist construction. He cited many specific and vivid facts to illustrate the superiority of the people's communes, and the firm support of the broad masses of the people for the commune system. He also used the Great Leap Forward to change the face of Guangdong Province, as well as the impact of the Great Leap Forward on future socialist construction work, to illustrate the great significance of the Great Leap Forward movement. In his speech, he also talked about the issue of uniting all forces that can be united and striving to build our country into a great socialist country, and the issue that every revolutionary should move forward firmly.

The representatives listened to the work report made by Governor Chen Yu on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee, and the report by Vice Governor Wei Jinfei on the final accounts of Guangdong Province in 1958 and the draft budget of Guangdong Province in 1959, and seriously conducted group meetings and general discussions. One hundred and seventy-eight people spoke at the meeting and made written statements. The representatives also visited some large factories in Guangzhou and the Huangpu People's Commune in the suburbs. In the discussion, the representatives enthusiastically praised the great victory of the Party's General Line and the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and praised the superiority of the people's communes, based on the vivid facts of the Great Leap Forward in their respective regions for the past ten years, especially the past year or so. They pointed out that Guangdong was a grain-deficient province before liberation, but in the Great Leap Forward last year, the total grain output jumped to 32 billion catties, creating a miracle of a 31% increase over the previous year, and a doubling compared with 1949. Great achievements have also been made in forestry, aquatic products, and cash crops. Industrial production has developed rapidly, with the total industrial output value last year increasing by 62.4% compared with the previous year. When talking about the brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward, the representatives enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the people's communes, and believed that it was because of the people's communes that such great achievements were achieved in agriculture and industry. Many representatives excitedly cheered "Long live the People's Commune!" when speaking at the meeting.

The representatives attending the meeting unanimously believed that the industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of work in Guangdong in the first eight months of this year continued to leap forward. The total industrial output value from January to August was 4.002 billion yuan, an increase of 42.3% over the same period last year. Although early rice suffered a severe flood and the sown area was reduced compared with the same period last year, the average yield per unit area was higher than last year, and the total grain output of spring and summer harvests in the first half of the year reached more than 9 billion catties. This year's summer planting tasks were completed very well. Since the anti-rightist and encouraging efforts on the economic front, and the launch of the movement to increase production and practice economy, industrial production has been leaping forward across the board. The output of 29 products such as raw coal, steel, steel materials, and hydrochloric acid increased significantly in August and September compared with the past. In terms of agricultural production, late rice is growing well, and a scene of bumper harvest is everywhere. The meeting called on the people of the province to boost greater efforts, fight vigorously in the fourth quarter, and achieve an eighty percent harvest of late crops with the determination to achieve a ten percent increase, and strive to complete the annual production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule in industry.

The meeting re-elected Jiao Niansheng as the President of the Foshan District Intermediate People's Court, Liao You as the President of the Zhanjiang District Intermediate People's Court, and adopted various resolutions.
