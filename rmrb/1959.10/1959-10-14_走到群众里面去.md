　　Go Among the Masses
　　Kǒng Sāng
    The Shenyang Transformer Factory organized advanced producers and established an "Advanced Producer Service Team," turning the activity of advanced helping the backward into a factory-wide, planned, and purposeful activity, thereby making a major leap forward in overall production in just over two months.
    Why does this organizational form have such great power? I am afraid that the main thing does not lie in the form, but in the fact that this factory has organized the most valuable thing that has emerged in the Great Leap Forward—the communist elements in people's minds. Warm and selfless help to others, the spirit of cooperation of putting others before oneself, and selfless labor regardless of remuneration are new qualities and new styles that were an important force in promoting the Great Leap Forward last year. This year, these qualities and styles have developed even more. The communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation of both "competition" and "help" has become a distinct feature of this year's upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy from the very beginning. In the face of this new situation, good leaders are walking in front of the masses, trying to make the communist style among the masses more and more developed, and playing a greater role in the continued Great Leap Forward. The approach taken by the Shenyang Transformer Factory has this characteristic.
    To do this, we must first have a deep understanding and infinite trust in the consciousness and strength of the masses. Haven't we seen such people? They clearly see the masses working without pay and selflessly helping others, but they stubbornly refuse to believe that this is the consciousness of the masses. They even put on a posture of defenders of morality, saying that this violates the principles of "distribution according to work" and "material incentives," and will affect the workers' production enthusiasm, as if they are the ones who understand the workers best and protect the workers' interests the most. These people call themselves Marxists, but in fact, they have exposed their bourgeois views on the touchstone of how to view the masses. We are historical materialists. Before the social products are extremely abundant, in the socialist stage, we adhere to the principle of distribution according to work. In the current upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, we also attach great importance to wage and welfare work, and attach importance to materially rewarding those who produce well. However, for us, the most important thing is the communist consciousness of the masses. We rely on people with great ideals to build communism to strive for high speed, rather than simply hoping to use money to promote people to build communism.
    The situation is infinitely good, and thousands of advanced producers are full of energy and do not care about remuneration. However, how to give play to the role of advanced figures and make the pace of the leap forward bigger and faster depends on how the communist advanced elements there are organized and how the masses are mobilized. If we fully mobilize the masses and turn the level of advanced producers into the level of society, our production front will bloom more splendid flowers.

　　走到群众里面去
　　孔桑
    沈阳变压器厂把先进生产者组织起来，成立“先进生产者服务队”，把先进帮助落后的活动变成了全厂规模的、有计划、有目的的活动，从而在短短的两个多月里，使生产全面跃进了一大步。
    为什么这种组织形式有这样大的威力呢？恐怕主要的并不在于形式，而在于这个厂把大跃进中出现的最宝贵的东西——人们思想里的共产主义因素，组织了起来。热忱无私地帮助别人，先人后己的协作精神，不计报酬的忘我劳动，这种新品格新风尚，是去年推动大跃进的一个重要力量。今年，这种品格和风尚更加发展了。又“赛”又“帮”的共产主义互助协作之风，从一开始就成为今年增产节约高潮一个鲜明的特色。在这种新形势面前，好的领导者是走在群众的前面，想方设法使群众中的共产主义风格更加发扬光大，在继续大跃进中发挥更大的作用。沈阳变压器厂采取的这种做法就具有这种特色。
    要这样做，首先要对群众的觉悟和力量有深刻的认识和无限的信任。我们不是看到过这样的人吗？他们明明看见群众不计报酬地劳动，忘我地帮助别人，却硬不相信这是群众的自觉。他们甚至装出一副卫道者的模样，说什么这是违反了“按劳分配”“物质刺激”的原则，会影响工人的生产情绪，好像他们才是最了解工人、最维护工人利益的人。这些人自封为马克思主义者，实际上，却在如何看待群众这块试金石上暴露了他们的资产阶级观点。我们是历史唯物论者，在社会产品没有极大丰富之前，在社会主义阶段，我们坚持按劳分配的原则，在当前的增产节约高潮中，我们也十分重视工资福利工作，重视从物质上奖励生产好的人。但是，对于我们，最重要的是群众的共产主义觉悟，我们依靠建设共产主义有伟大理想的人来争取高速度，而不是单单指望用金钱来推动人们去建设共产主义。
    形势无限好，千千万万的先进生产者都是干劲冲天，不计报酬的。但是，如何发挥先进人物的作用，使跃进的步伐更大更快，却要看那里的共产主义先进因素组织得怎样，群众发动得怎样。充分发动群众，把先进生产者的水平变为社会的水平，我们的生产战线就会开放更灿烂的花朵。
