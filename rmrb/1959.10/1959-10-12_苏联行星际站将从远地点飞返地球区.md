Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: TASS reports: The Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket reached its apogee on October 10th.

The accurate launch of the automatic interplanetary station into its predetermined orbit by the multi-stage cosmic rocket ensured that the interplanetary station passed through a strictly defined position when it was closest to the moon. This allowed the interplanetary station to continue its flight along a curved trajectory that, as required, utilized the moon's gravitational influence, ensuring its return from the northern hemisphere to the Earth region.

As the automatic interplanetary station continues its return to Earth from the northern part of the celestial sphere, it will continuously increase its declination. For areas north of 60 degrees north latitude, the interplanetary station will not fall below the horizon at any time from October 15th to 18th.

At 20:00 Moscow time on October 10th, the automatic interplanetary station was located in the constellation Ophiuchus, with equatorial coordinates: right ascension sixteen hours forty-four minutes, declination one degree twenty-three minutes.

At this time, the coordinates of the interplanetary station above the Earth's surface were: 1.4 degrees north latitude, 22.6 degrees west longitude, and 470,000 kilometers from Earth.

The scientific instruments, energy, and temperature control systems of the interplanetary station continue to operate normally. As previously reported, the next broadcast of scientific measurement materials will be at 17:00 to 18:00 Moscow time on October 12th and 15th.

　　苏联行星际站将从远地点飞返地球区
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联第三个宇宙火箭在10月10日到达远地点。
    用多级宇宙火箭准确地把自动行星际站发向预定轨道，保证了行星际站在同月球最接近时在严格规定的位置通过。这样，便使行星际站能够按照要求，利用月球引力的影响，沿着保证它从北半球返回到地球区来的曲线轨道继续飞行。
    当自动行星际站从天穹北部继续返回地球的时候，将不断地增加它的赤纬的度数。对于北纬六十度以北的地方来说，从10月15日到18日期间，行星际站在任何时间都不会落在地平线下面。
    莫斯科时间10月10日二十时，自动行星际站位置在蛇夫座中，赤道座标是：赤经十六时四十四分，赤纬一度二十三分。
    这时，行星际站位于地球表面上空的座标是：北纬一点四度，西经二十二点六度，距地球四十七万公里。
    行星际站的科学仪器，能源和温度调节系统继续正常工作，前已报道，下一次的科学测量材料的放送时间是莫斯科时间10月12日和15日十七点到十八点。
