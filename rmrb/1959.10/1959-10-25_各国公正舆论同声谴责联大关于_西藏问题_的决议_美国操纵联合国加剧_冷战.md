Xinhua News Agency, October 24th Dispatch: According to a TASS report, the Soviet "Pravda" today published an article condemning American diplomats for forcing the General Assembly to pass a so-called resolution on the "Tibet issue."

The article said that if some member states of the United Nations attempt to impose their will on other countries in the future, and if major powers cannot cooperate equally within the United Nations in the future, then the United Nations will no longer be able to become an international organization. The current international situation requires strict adherence to this principle of the United Nations.

The article condemned the ruling groups of Western countries, especially certain groups in the United States, for not abandoning the use of "Cold War" methods in the United Nations. The article said that at this session of the General Assembly, these groups also obstructed the discussion of the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. The American diplomats' forcing the General Assembly to pass the so-called resolution on the "Tibet issue" can only be seen as a desperate attempt to obstruct the restoration of the rights of the 600 million Chinese people in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 24th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today entitled "Another Shameful Resolution," condemning the US imperialists for manipulating the United Nations to pass a so-called "Tibet issue" resolution to intensify the "Cold War."

The commentary said that the UN's discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue" and the resolution it passed once again nakedly exposed that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of world peace and human security.

The commentary pointed out that the so-called "Tibet issue" resolution is an absurd thing manufactured single-handedly by US imperialism. US imperialism attempts to use this to slander and libel the People's Republic of China and to undermine the relations between the People's Republic of China and other Asian and African countries. However, the vast majority of Asian and African countries did not participate in the US imperialist conspiracy against the People's Republic of China.

The commentary said that this desperate struggle by US imperialism is a manifestation of trembling in the face of the comprehensive bankruptcy of its aggressive policy and "position of strength" policy, and the unparalleled growth of the forces of peace and socialism. This is also a manifestation of US imperialism's hatred of the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in socialist construction over the past ten years, and its struggle after the expectations of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet were completely bankrupt.

The commentary said that Tibet will always be a part of the People's Republic of China. The clamoring of US imperialism and its lackeys not only cannot harm, but further proves the high international prestige of the People's Republic of China. What has been damaged is the prestige of the United Nations. This measure against the People's Republic of China has brutally trampled on the United Nations Charter and undermined the very foundation of the United Nations.

The commentary concluded by saying that the so-called "Tibet issue" resolution fabricated by US imperialism is completely illegal. No matter how the imperialists clamor, the forces of peace and socialism will continue to strengthen, and the People's Republic of China will prosper and develop into a great socialist power.

"Pyongyang News" also said in a commentary today that the so-called resolution on the "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations in blatant violation of the United Nations Charter can only arouse the ridicule of world public opinion.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 23rd: The Mongolian "Unen" published a commentary on the 22nd saying that the United Nations General Assembly's inclusion of the so-called "Tibet issue" on the meeting agenda is a new "Cold War" conspiracy and a shameless interference in China's internal affairs. This behavior also brutally violates the Charter of the United Nations.

The commentary said that this provocative proposal was nominally put forward by Ireland and Malaya, but in reality, it was stamped with the mark of the United States. It is extremely regrettable that the United Nations has once again become a major base for "Cold War" forces.

The commentary said that world public opinion must not tolerate the situation in which US representatives still use the "Cold War" as a guide.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 24th: The Polish "Trybuna Ludu" published a commentary today saying that forces unwilling to ease the international situation still want to continue to use the United Nations organization, and raise the so-called "Tibet issue" which does not exist at all.

The commentary believes that after defeating fascism, the international situation was clouded and the wind of the "Cold War" was blowing, which was reflected in the role and activities of the United Nations organization. The absence of representatives of People's China in the United Nations is one of the reasons for the paralysis of the organization's activities.

The commentary in "Kurier Polski" pointed out that raising the so-called "Tibet issue" at the recent United Nations General Assembly is an outdated "Cold War" tactic, the purpose of which is to poison the international atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, October 24th: The Romanian "Scînteia" published a commentary today pointing out that the United Nations has condoned the activities of those who oppose easing the international situation on the so-called "Tibet issue." This behavior damages the status and prestige of the United Nations.

The commentary said that it cannot be ignored that at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, certain Western countries continued to show a spirit that violated the interests of easing the international situation. Due to the tricks of the Cold War believers, the People's Republic of China, one of the world's major powers, has still not obtained its legitimate rights in the United Nations, which cannot but damage the status and prestige of the United Nations.

The "Tineretul liber" commentary questioned: If discussing the so-called "Tibet issue" and passing resolutions that interfere in China's internal affairs do not mean continuing the Cold War, then what does it mean? The commentary went on to say that while being unwilling to accept the legitimate representatives of China into the United Nations, the knights of the Cold War are striving to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. However, these attempts have been duly struck by peace-loving countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 23rd: The Burmese Peace Committee issued a statement today pointing out that the United Nations has become a tool for the Western bloc headed by the United States to achieve their political and economic goals, which has greatly reduced the prestige and honor of the United Nations organization.

The statement, issued on the fourteenth anniversary of "United Nations Day," condemned the illegal deprivation of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and condemned the establishment and conclusion of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other military treaties that threaten the security of Burma and other Southeast Asian countries and cause international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 23rd: The National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, in an open letter to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, pointed out that the imperialist countries and their followers forced the Tibet issue to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, and have stubbornly obstructed the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. This shows that the United Nations is now easily used as a tool to promote an aggressive policy.

This open letter, written by the National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union in the name of 2.7 million members and all the working people of Indonesia, demanded that the United Nations truly adhere to the spirit and ideals of the United Nations Charter.

Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Jerusalem News: The Israeli Communist Party organ "Kol Ha'am" published an article on the 23rd condemning the United Nations' discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue" as a shameful act. The article pointed out that even the most mad anti-China elements have to admit that Tibet is an inseparable part of China.

The article concluded by saying that those who raised the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations will not gain decent benefits, and they will suffer a shameful end. This is the natural result of their defending the Tibetan slave owners, because the fate of the Tibetan slave owners has already been decided by the Tibetan people.

    各国公正舆论同声谴责联大关于“西藏问题”的决议
    美国操纵联合国加剧“冷战”
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“真理报”今天在一篇文章中谴责美国外交家强迫大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的决议。
    文章说，如果联合国的一些成员国今后企图把自己的意志强加给另一些国家；如果今后各大国不能在联合国内平等合作，那么，联合国就不再能成为一个国际组织。当前国际局势要求严格地履行联合国的这项原则。
    文章谴责西方国家统治集团，特别是美国的某些集团不放弃在联合国使用“冷战”的方法。文章说，在本届大会上，这些集团还阻挠讨论中国在联合国的代表权问题。美国外交家强迫大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的决议，只能看作是绝望地企图阻挠恢复六亿中国人民在联合国的权利。
    新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“又一个可耻的决议”的评论，谴责美帝国主义操纵联合国通过所谓“西藏问题”决议来加剧“冷战”的行为。
    评论说，这次联大对所谓“西藏问题”的讨论和所通过的决议，又一次赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义是世界和平和人类安全的最凶恶的敌人。
    评论指出，所谓“西藏问题”的决议是美帝国主义一手制造的荒谬绝伦的东西。美帝国主义企图以此来诽谤和中伤中华人民共和国、破坏中华人民共和国同其他亚非国家的关系。但是绝大多数的亚非国家都没有参加美帝国主义反对中华人民共和国的阴谋。
    评论说，美帝国主义的这种拼命的挣扎是在它的侵略政策和“实力地位”政策全面破产、和平和社会主义力量无比壮大的情况下发抖的表现。这也是美帝国主义憎恨中华人民共和国十年来在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就，对西藏上层反动集团的期待完全遭到破产以后进行挣扎的表现。
    评论说，西藏永远是中华人民共和国的一部分。美帝国主义和它的走狗的叫嚣不但不能损害，而且更加证明了中华人民共和国的高度的国际威信。受到损害的却是联合国的威信，这次反对中华人民共和国的措施，粗暴地蹂躏了联合国宪章，破坏了联合国本身的基础。
    评论最后说，美帝国主义制造的所谓“西藏问题”的决议是完全非法的。不管帝国主义者们怎样叫嚣，和平和社会主义的力量将继续加强，中华人民共和国将繁荣发展成为伟大的社会主义大国。
    “平壤新闻”今天在评论中也说，联合国粗暴地违反联合国宪章所通过的所谓关于“西藏问题”的决议，只能引起世界舆论的嘲笑。
    新华社乌兰巴托23日电　蒙古“劳动报”22日发表评论说，联合国大会将所谓“西藏问题”列入会议议程是新的“冷战”阴谋，是对中国内政的无耻干涉。这种行为同时也粗暴地违反了联合国的宪章。
    评论说，这个挑衅性的提案名义上是爱尔兰和马来亚提出的，但实际上则烙有美国的印记。令人非常遗憾的是，联合国又变成了“冷战”势力的主要基地。
    评论说，世界公众绝不能容忍美国代表仍然以“冷战”为指南的情况。
    据新华社华沙24日电　波兰“人民论坛报”今天发表评论说，不愿意使国际局势得到缓和的势力，仍然想继续利用联合国组织，而提出根本不存在的所谓“西藏问题”。
    评论认为，在战胜法西斯以后，国际局势被阴云所遮并刮起了“冷战”之风，这些在联合国组织的作用和活动上得到了反映。在联合国没有人民中国的代表，是这个组织的活动处于瘫痪状态的一个原因。
    “波兰信使报”的评论指出，在最近一次联合国大会上提出所谓“西藏问题”是陈旧的“冷战”手段，其目的是想毒化国际气氛。
    新华社布加勒斯特24日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”今天发表评论指出，联合国在所谓“西藏问题”上纵容了反对缓和国际局势的分子的勾当。这种行为有损联合国的地位和威望。
    评论说，不能忽视，在本届联合国大会上，某些西方国家继续表现出违反缓和国际局势利益的精神。由于冷战信徒们的伎俩，世界大国之一的中华人民共和国仍没有得到它在联合国中的合法权利，这不能不有损联合国的地位和威望。
    “青年火花报”评论中质问道：讨论所谓“西藏问题”和通过干涉中国内政的决议，如果不意味着继续冷战，那意味着什么呢？评论接着说，冷战骑士们在不愿意接受中国的合法代表进入联合国的同时，努力利用联合国去干涉中国的内政。但是，这些企图遭到了爱好和平国家的应有打击。
    据新华社仰光23日电　缅甸保卫世界和平委员会今天发表声明指出，联合国已经成为以美国为首的西方集团实现它们的政治和经济目的的工具，这大大地降低了联合国组织的威信和荣誉。
    在“联合国日”十四周年来到时发表的这项声明，谴责非法剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位，谴责成立和缔结威胁缅甸和其他东南亚国家安全并造成国际关系紧张的东南亚条约组织和其他军事条约。
    据新华社雅加达23日电　全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会在给联合国大会主席的一封公开信中指出，帝国主义国家及其追随者强使西藏问题提交联合国大会，以及一直顽固地阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。这表明，现在联合国已经轻易地被当作推行侵略政策的工具。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会以二百七十万会员和印度尼西亚全体劳动人民的名义所写的这封公开信，要求联合国真正忠于联合国宪章的精神和理想。
    据新华社23日讯　耶路撒冷消息：以色列共产党机关报“人民呼声报”在23日发表文章，谴责联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”是可耻的行为。文章指出，连最疯狂的反华分子也不得不承认，西藏是中国不可分割的一部分。
    文章最后说，在联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”的人不会得到体面的收获，他们将遭到可耻的下场，这是他们为西藏奴隶主辩护的理所当然的结果，因为西藏奴隶主的命运已经由西藏人民决定了。
