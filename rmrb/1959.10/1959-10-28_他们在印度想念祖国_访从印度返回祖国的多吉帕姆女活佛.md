They Miss Their Motherland in India
——An Interview with Dorje Pamo, a Female Living Buddha Who Returned to the Motherland from India
Xinhua News Agency reporter Gong Ce, Zhao Qi

Dorje Pamo, a female Living Buddha who was coerced to India by Tibetan rebels, returned to the motherland not long ago. She recently gave Xinhua News Agency reporters a detailed account of her experience of being coerced to India by the rebels. As the most authoritative witness, she asked the reporters to make public everything she had heard and seen.

Living Buddha Dorje Pamo is only twenty-two years old this year. She is a famous female Living Buddha of the Shuma Sect (Red Sect) of Tibetan Buddhism. Her Yangzhuo Sangding Temple is located near Yangzhuo Yong Lake in Langkazong, northeast of Gyantse. This temple has a history of hundreds of years. Living Buddha Dorje Pamo has now been passed down for twelve generations.

This young female Living Buddha was coerced to India by armed Tibetan rebels in early April this year. Dorje Pamo said that her hometown became a place where rebels ran rampant in the second half of 1958. The Zongben dispatched to Langkazong by the former Tibetan local government was the head of the rebels here. At that time, the rebels continuously threatened and persecuted this patriotic female Living Buddha who had participated in the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. They robbed the monastery of horses and materials, forbade her from hanging Chairman Mao's portrait, and threatened her, saying: "You used to work in the Preparatory Committee, took the Han people's silver dollars, and did bad things. Now you have to listen to us, otherwise you will be killed."

Dorje Pamo said that in order to avoid the persecution of the rebels, she had to hide Chairman Mao's portrait behind the Buddha statue and began a six-month "retreat" (that is, meditation in Buddhism). According to Buddhist rules, no one except the attendants can approach the Living Buddha during the "retreat." However, the rebels still often came to the temple to disturb her during the "retreat," and even groups of rebels gathered in the temple to drink alcohol. It was also during this period that one day she suddenly received a threatening letter sent by Antu Lexe, the commander of the rebel army in Duozong Luore area of ​​Shannan. The letter said, "You have done a lot of bad things in the past. Now that you have fallen into our hands, if you do not repent in the future, you will only have a dead end!"

Dorje Pamo said that her parents' house was looted by the rebels, and the rebels threatened to kill her father and burn her mother to death. Her parents were forced to flee to other places.

On April 10 this year, after the rebels in Lhasa and Zedang were defeated by the People's Liberation Army, a large number of them fled to the Sino-Indian border. At this time, Dorje Pamo was taken away from Sangding Temple by armed rebels. Five or six armed rebels took her away ferociously. She left her hometown and temple in tears while suffering from illness. After walking for about half a day, she encountered a large team of more than 500 people led by the rebel leader Kaimo. She was caught in the team, and it was really difficult to escape at this time.

She said that the days in the rebel team were a terrible moment that she would never forget. Wherever the rebels passed, there was blood everywhere, as if the end of the world was coming. She said that at that time, this group of bandits fled to the Duozong Luore area day and night. Whenever they heard the masses shouting "Jinzhumami Yongge!" (meaning "The Liberation Army is coming!"), they fled even more frantically. Some bandits fled in embarrassment on bare-backed horses. They robbed all the way, openly raped women on the road, stripped farmers of their clothes, and slaughtered the plowing cattle taken from the plows on the spot, tearing and eating them like wild beasts. The grain robbed along the way was scattered all over the ground. Dorje Pamo said that young women in some places hid in the deep mountains, and the rebels grabbed elderly women to "replace" them. On one occasion, thirty rebels gang-raped a woman. The crimes of the rebels that she witnessed were really countless.

Dorje Pamo said that she and other coerced people were driven through the snow-capped mountains and forests for seven days. There were no roads in that area. After they ate up the zanba, they had to rely on digging wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger. They lay in the open air at night and covered themselves with leaves to spend the night. She spent fifteen days living like this savage.

She was coerced to Basa, a place on the northeastern border of India, where there was a "refugee camp." On the day they arrived in Basa, she saw the traitor Pala Tuden, Sokang Kanqiong (the younger brother of rebel leader Sokang Wangqingge), and Indian officers were there, checking the arriving "refugees" one by one. At that time, this "refugee camp" had already taken in more than 1,700 people. Around the "refugee camp," there were Indian soldiers on guard. When they first arrived there, each person was given some rice and flour, but a month later, what people ate was food that was not water or soup.

Dorje Pamo then talked about her situation after going from Basa to Kalimpong. He said, "I declared to the 'refugee' reception authorities that I was willing to find a way to make a living on my own. They let two armed Indian soldiers 'accompany' me to take a car to Siliguri and then to Kalimpong. The Indian police, like other 'refugees,' asked me to register and fingerprint. This registration is valid for three months, and after it expires, I have to go through the registration procedures again.

"In Kalimpong, there are some even more heartbreaking situations. The upper-class people live in big hotels, and the poor people who were coerced there can't even eat a handful of beans. They have to use things that are not even as good as pig and dog feed to satisfy their hunger. Some people work as coolies at the station to make a living, and the clothes on their bodies are so tattered that they can't cover their shame." When reporters asked about the religious life of these people in India, she said in surprise, "Now they can't even take care of food and clothing, so what religious life is there?"

The Living Buddha said, "I stayed in Kalimpong for more than four months, and it felt longer than four years. When I thought of my parents in Tibet, that I was a Chinese, thought of the rebels' unscrupulous crimes, thought of myself and other Tibetan compatriots suffering the pain of leaving our homes, and compared it with the benefits of the Communist Party and Han Chinese working comrades, I would rather die than return to China. I don't know how many times I cried."

She said: "Like my mood, among many deceived and coerced people, there are many people who miss the motherland day and night. They said that they are Chinese and are unwilling to live under the roof of others. In Kalimpong, people secretly bought pamphlets of letters between General Tan Guansan and the Dalai Lama from the book stalls and whispered behind their backs. In Basa, I heard many people shout in hunger and disease: 'We can't live anymore!'"

Dorje Pamo then talked about many of her experiences during her detention in India. Talking about Kalimpong, she said: "This is a strange city that makes people uneasy. There are all kinds of inexplicable foreigners on the street. Sometimes when I go outside, people follow me. Sometimes they even openly threaten me in the hotel. The owner of a hotel where I stayed showed me even more unusual 'courtesy'. He often tried to approach me and secretly monitor me, and took the initiative to ask to 'lead the way' when I went out. It was because of this boss's 'help' that I encountered many difficulties and twists and turns in the struggle to return to China. One day, an English woman brought an Indian young man to the hotel where I lived. They said to me: A meeting is going to be held in New Delhi recently, and asked me what opinions and requirements I have. They said they could raise it there on my behalf. At that time, I rejected their 'concern'."

Dorje Pamo said that there are new rumors in this city every day, and they spread quickly, such as: "The Third World War is about to break out. If it breaks out, China and the Soviet Union will definitely be defeated!" There are also some laughable rumors, such as: "China's top ten cities have been washed away by water!" "The Panchen has been put in jail!" and so on.

Living Buddha Dorje Pamo returned to the embrace of the motherland after many twists and turns, and participated in the grand celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country in Beijing. She was extremely happy to see the prosperity of the motherland. During her stay in Beijing, she, along with Panchen Erdeni and other leaders of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, met with Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and other party and state leaders. At a banquet she was invited to attend, Premier Zhou Enlai met her, warmly comforted her, and raised his glass to congratulate her on her triumphant return. All of this made her unforgettable for a long time, and the excited mood made her shed tears of gratitude several times.

The female Living Buddha told reporters: "After arriving in Beijing, I felt like I had returned to my own home. The Han Chinese cadres received me warmly, just like close brothers. Compared with the warmth of the motherland towards me, I thought even more of the suffering of being coerced to India." She said: "Now, I have obtained a happy life and have been freed from the sea of ​​misery forever. However, many Tibetan brothers and sisters who have been coerced and deceived are still detained in India. I can understand their pain, and I sincerely hope that they can return soon."

Talking about the suppression of the rebellion and the democratic reform in Tibet, Dorje Pamo said: "When I was in Kalimpong, I heard that the rebellion in Tibet had been suppressed, and I was secretly happy in my heart, so I became even more determined that I would rather die than stay in India."

"In the past, due to the obstruction of the reactionary group in the upper echelons of Tibet, the democratic reform in Tibet could not be carried out. Now that the rebellion has been suppressed and the democratic reform has been launched in the entire region, I express my warm support. Now in the interior of the motherland, I have personally seen the goodness of socialism and the happy life of the people. I believe that Tibet will also enter socialism, and people will definitely get a happy life soon."

The female Living Buddha also severely condemned the United States for manipulating the United Nations to pass an illegal resolution on the "Tibet issue." She said, "The United States forced the United Nations to discuss the Tibet issue, which is completely illegal. Tibet will never leave the motherland. The entire Chinese people and the people of the world oppose the United Nations interfering in China's internal affairs, and I firmly oppose it too."

She said indignantly: "Suppressing the rebellion and carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet is not a deprivation of basic human rights and freedom of religious belief at all. On the contrary, it is imperialism and the reactionary group in the upper echelons of Tibet who have committed these crimes. Under the serf system in Tibet, the Tibetan compatriots do not have real human rights. The serf owners have the power. Take women as an example, they don't even have the right to speak. This time the rebels raised the banner of the 'Defend Religion Army', but in fact they are the scum who truly destroy religion and harm the people. I personally saw them wantonly destroying temples and damaging statues of gods. Almost every ordinary woman who was coerced was raped by these jackals. No one will believe the slanders of imperialism."

Living Buddha Dorje Pamo finally said: "All this is very obvious. Imperialism and the Tibetan reactionaries see that the Tibetan people are about to stand up, and they hate it and try to interfere and hinder our progress. No matter how they attack, the direction of the Tibetan people under the leadership of the Communist Party today will never change, and the unity of the Tibetan and Han peoples cannot be destroyed by anyone."

The female Living Buddha spent a full four hours telling us about her tragic experience. When we said "Tujiqi" (thank you) in Tibetan to express our gratitude to her, she looked at us with a warm smile. Finally, she said: "All this is the real situation of the Tibetan rebellion that I have seen. Everyone who has been coerced and deceived now understands everything even more. This is a very good lesson. They all miss the motherland in foreign lands - I hope my folks will come back soon!" (Attached photo)

    他们在印度想念祖国
    ——访从印度返回祖国的多吉帕姆女活佛
    新华社记者　宫策　赵奇
    被西藏叛乱分子裹胁到印度的女活佛多吉帕姆，不久以前回到祖国，她最近向新华社记者详述了被叛匪胁迫去印度的经历。她以最权威的见证人的资格，要求记者们把她耳闻目睹的一切公诸于世。
    多吉帕姆活佛今年还只有二十二岁，她是西藏佛教守玛派（红教）著名的女活佛，她所在的羊卓桑定寺，座落在江孜东北朗戛子宗羊卓雍湖的附近，这座寺庙已有数百年的历史。多吉帕姆活佛到现在已传继了十二世。
    这位年轻的女活佛是今年4月上旬被武装的西藏叛匪裹胁到印度去的。多吉帕姆说，她的家乡在1958年下半年变成了叛匪横行的地方，原西藏地方政府派驻朗戛子宗的宗本，便是这里叛匪的头目。当时，叛匪对这个曾经参加过西藏自治区筹委会工作的爱国女活佛，不断进行威胁和迫害，他们抢走了寺院的马匹和物资，不准她挂毛主席像，并对她威胁说：“你过去在筹委会工作，拿了汉人的大洋，做了坏事，现在要听我们的，否则你会有杀身之祸。”
    多吉帕姆说，为了躲避叛匪的迫害，她当时不得不将毛主席的像藏到佛像背后，开始了为期六个月的“闭关”（即佛教中的静修）。按照佛教教规，活佛在“闭关”期内，除了侍候的人以外，任何人都不能接近她。但是叛匪在“闭关”期内依然经常到寺庙来打扰她，甚至成群叛匪聚集在寺内酗酒。也就在这个期间，有一天她突然接到山南多宗洛热地区叛匪司令安多列谢派人送来的恫吓信，信上说，“你过去做了很多坏事，现在落在我们手里，今后如不悔改，就只有死路一条！”
    多吉帕姆说，她父母家里，当时被叛匪抢劫一空，叛匪并扬言要杀死她的父亲，烧死她的母亲。她的父母被迫逃到其他地方。
    今年4月10日，叛匪在拉萨和泽当被人民解放军打垮以后，大批向中印边境逃去，这时，多吉帕姆被武装叛匪劫离桑定寺。五、六个带枪的叛匪穷凶极恶地把她架走了，她带着病，啼哭着离开了自己的家乡和寺庙。大约走了半天的路程，遇上了叛匪头子凯墨所率领的五百多人的大队，她被夹在队伍中，此时真是插翅也难脱逃了。
    她说，在叛匪队伍里的那些日子，是她终生难忘的一个可怕的时刻，叛匪所过之处，留下了遍地血腥，真好像末
  日到来一样。她说，当时这群匪徒不分昼夜地向多宗洛热地区逃走，他们一听到群众喊“金珠玛米雍格！”（即“解放军来了”）就更加慌张地逃窜，有的匪徒狼狈地骑在光背马上逃走。他们走一路，抢一路，公开在大路上强奸妇女，剥光农民的衣服，从犁耙上解下春耕的耕牛当场杀掉，像野兽一样地撕吃，一路之上抢来的粮食抛撒满地。多吉帕姆说，有的地方青年妇女躲进深山，叛匪便抓住老年妇女要他们“代替”，有一次竟有三十个叛匪轮奸了一个妇女。她目击到的叛匪罪行真是难以数计。
    多吉帕姆说，她和其他被裹胁的人一起被驱赶着在雪山和森林里走了七天，那一带连路都没有。他们吃完了糌粑，最后只有依靠挖野菜充饥，晚上躺在露天里，用树叶复身过夜。这样野人一般的生活她整整度过了十五天。
    她被裹胁到印度东北边境的巴萨地方，在那里，有一所“难民营”。他们到达巴萨的那一天，她看到叛国分子帕拉·土登为登、索康堪穷（叛匪头子索康·旺清格来之弟）和印度军官们在一起，正在那里挨个地检查到达的“难民”。当时这所“难民营”已经收下一千七百多人了。“难民营”的周围，有印度兵放哨。刚到那里时，每人还发了些米面，但是一个月以后，人们吃的就是水不是水、汤不是汤的饭食了。
    多吉帕姆接着谈到了她由巴萨到噶伦堡后的情况。他说，我向“难民”收留当局声明愿自找生活出路，他们让两个武装的印度兵“陪着”我坐汽车到西里古里后再到噶伦堡。印度警察对我像其他“难民”一样，要我进行登记，按手印。这种登记的有效期是三个月，到期以后还要重新履行登记手续。
    “在噶伦堡，有些更令人伤心的情况，上层人住的是大旅馆，被裹胁去的穷人连一把豆子都吃不上，他们不得不用连猪狗饲料都不如的东西充饥。有些人在车站上当苦力维生，身上衣服破烂得遮不住羞。”当记者问到这些人在印度的宗教生活时，她惊讶地说，“现在他们连衣食都顾不上，那里还有什么宗教生活？”
    这位活佛说，“我在噶伦堡呆了四个多月，觉得比四年时间还长。当我想到自己的父母在西藏，我是个中国人，想到叛匪无恶不作的罪行，想到自己和其他被裹胁的西藏同胞忍受背井离乡之苦的时候，又比比共产党和汉族工作同志对我的好处，我宁死也要回国，我不知哭了多少次。”
    她说：“和我的心情一样，在许多被欺骗、被裹胁的人中间，有不少人也都在日夜地怀念祖国，他们说他们是中国人，不愿意寄人篱下。在噶伦堡，人们偷偷地从书摊上买了谭冠三将军和达赖喇嘛来往信件的小册子阅读，背后窃窃私议。在巴萨，我听到过许多人在饥饿疾病中呼喊：‘我们活不下去了！’”
    多吉帕姆随后谈到她羁留印度期间的许多见闻。谈到噶伦堡，她说：“这是一个令人不安的奇怪的城市，那里街上有各种各样莫名其妙的外国人，我有时到外面走走，后面就有人跟着。有时他们还公开到旅馆里对我进行威胁。我住的一个旅馆的老板，对我更表示不寻常的‘殷勤’，他经常设法接近我，暗地监视我，在我外出时主动要求给我‘带路’。就是因为这个老板的‘帮助’，使我在争取回国的斗争中遇到了许多困难和曲折。有一天，有个英国女人带着一个印度青年人，找到我住的旅馆来，他们对我说：最近在新德里要开个会，问我有什么意见和要求，他们说可以代我在那里提出来。当时我拒绝了他们的‘关心’”。
    多吉帕姆说，这个城市每天都有新的谣言，并且传播得很快，例如：“第三次世界大战要打起来了，打起来中苏两国必败！”还有一些令人发笑的谣言，如：“中国十大城市被水冲光了！”“班禅被关进监狱了！”等等。
    多吉帕姆活佛辗转回到祖国的怀抱，并且在北京参加了伟大的建国十周年庆祝典礼，见到祖国繁荣兴旺的景象，她高兴万分。在北京期间，她随同班禅额尔德尼等西藏自治区筹委会的负责人，一起见过毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席等党和国家的领导人。在应邀出席的一次宴会上，周恩来总理同她相见，热情地安慰了她，并举杯祝贺她胜利归来。这一切都使她久久不能忘怀，激动的心情几次使她掉下感激的眼泪。
    这位女活佛对记者说：“到了北京后，我就好像回到了自己的家一样，汉族干部热情地接待我，就好像亲兄弟一般。祖国对我的一片温暖，对比之下，更使我想起被裹胁到印度的苦境。”她说：“现在，我已经得到了幸福的生活，永远脱离了苦海。可是许多被裹胁、被欺骗的藏族兄弟姊妹们，仍旧被羁留在印度，我能体会到他们的痛苦，我热烈地希望他们能够早日回来。”
    谈到在西藏进行的平息叛乱和民主改革时，多吉帕姆说：“我在噶伦堡时就听说西藏的叛乱被平息了，心里暗暗地高兴，因此我更下定决心宁死也不愿留在印度”。
    “过去因为西藏上层反动集团的阻挠，西藏的民主改革不能进行，现在叛乱平息了，民主改革在全区展开，我表示热烈地拥护。现在在祖国内地，我亲眼看到社会主义好，看到人民的幸福生活，相信西藏也会进入社会主义，人们一定也会很快得到幸福的生活。”
    这位女活佛还严厉谴责了美国操纵联合国通过关于“西藏问题”的非法决议。她说，“美国强迫联合国讨论西藏问题，完全是非法的。西藏永远也不会离开祖国。全中国人民和全世界人民都反对联合国干涉中国内政，我也坚决反对。”
    她愤慨地说：“在西藏平息叛乱和进行民主改革，根本不是什么剥夺基本人权和宗教信仰自由，恰恰相反，真正干下这些罪行的倒是帝国主义和西藏上层反动集团。在西藏农奴制度底下，西藏的同胞没有真正的人权，有权的是农奴主，就拿女人来说，甚至连说话的权利都没有。这次叛匪打起了‘卫教军’的旗帜，实际上他们是真正破坏宗教和残害人民的败类，我亲眼看到他们肆意地破坏寺庙，毁坏神像，被裹胁去的普通妇女，几乎没有一个不被这些豺狼强奸的。帝国主义对我们进行的诬蔑，谁也不会相信的。”
    多吉帕姆活佛最后说：“这一切都很明显，帝国主义和西藏反动派看到西藏人民要翻身了，他们仇恨起来，企图干涉和阻挠我们前进。不管他们怎样攻击，今天在共产党领导下的西藏人民，前进的方向是永远也不会变的，藏族和汉族的团结是任何人也破坏不了的。”
    这位女活佛整整花了四个多小时向我们叙述了她的悲惨经历，当我们用“土基其”（谢谢）这句藏语向她表示感谢时，她热情地笑着注视我们，最后她说：“这一切就是我所见到的西藏叛乱的真实情况，每一个被裹胁被欺骗的人，现在更加明白了一切。这是一堂很好的课，他们都在异国的土地上想念祖国，——希望我的乡亲们赶快回来吧！”（附图片）
