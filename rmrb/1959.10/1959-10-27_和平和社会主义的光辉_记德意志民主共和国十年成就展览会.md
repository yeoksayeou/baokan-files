The ancient autumn leaves in front of the Hall of Literary Glory in the Forbidden City are scattered all over the ground, but the Ten-Year Achievement Exhibition of our brothers from the German Democratic Republic on the banks of the Elbe River adds a touch of spring to this place. Since its opening on October 6, this exhibition has attracted countless visitors in more than 20 days and left a deep impression on people.

		Peace Doves Replace the Ferocious Eagles

In the center of the exhibition hall, next to the bright red background and golden national emblem, stands a white dove. The dove holds its head high, pure white and flawless. Looking closely at the surroundings, you will find that the shadow of this white dove covers many photos, including the historically significant photo of President Pieck announcing the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. That was in October 1949, a week after the birth of the new China, when our German brothers built a state where the working people were masters on one-third of the land of Germany on the banks of the Elbe. From then on, the two ferocious eagles in German history were replaced by peace doves. One of these two fierce eagles was the black eagle of the German Empire, under whose banner World War I was launched; the other was Hitler's eagle with the swastika, under whose banner World War II was launched. The photos of the war and ruins, the barbed wire and gallows of the concentration camps, are shocking, but they have disappeared with the fierce eagles. In the homeland of the founders of Marxism, the workers and peasants seized power for the first time, and the fierce eagles could no longer wreak havoc on the people. The people of the German Democratic Republic are fighting for a happy future under the symbol of the peace dove.

However, the Western occupiers and the German monopoly capitalists colluded in West Germany. This photo in the shadow of a tank clearly shows where they are leading West Germany. There, the people who once coveted the Soviet Urals have been resurrected. They are implementing a militaristic arms race policy and constantly provoking and sabotaging the peaceful and democratic German Democratic Republic. The determination and strength of the working people cannot be shaken. Look, how firm and powerful the worker in the photo is, with a peace dove standing on his shoulder and an axe in his hand. He will smash any war and sabotage conspiracy. Moreover, the entire socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, stands with the people of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, although there have been various provocations from West Germany over the past ten years, the working people have victoriously built their own country in the eastern part of Germany, allowing Marxist ideas to blossom and bear fruit in this new country.

		A Decade of Rapid Progress

The photos simply and clearly introduce the tremendous changes and achievements of the German Democratic Republic in the past ten years. How appealing is the photo of the farmers dividing the land of the Junkers and planting boundary stakes! Then, those small pieces of land, like a patchwork of hundreds of pieces of cloth, were connected into large tracts, and tractors cultivated on the boundless fields. Now, the cultivated land of cooperatives accounts for more than 40% of the country. Not to mention industry. Doesn't the vigorous posture of the Type 152 jet medium-range airliner model show the decade of rapid progress? In the ten years since the founding of the Republic, more than a thousand new and rebuilt factories have been built, and many new industrial sectors have been established, such as agricultural machinery and electrical machinery manufacturing, aviation industry, and shipbuilding industry. The 10,000-ton freighters manufactured by the shipbuilding industry are now sailing on the German Democratic Republic-China route.

There is a machine at the exhibition that makes plastic boxes. Pouring various colors of plastic powder into the mold, it can be pressed into a beautiful small box in just over a minute. Looking at these shiny and beautiful boxes, people can't help but ask, what are their raw materials? It is lignite. Not only can plastic be extracted from lignite, but also gasoline, lubricating oil, paraffin wax, synthetic fibers, pigments, alcohol, fertilizers, film, and twenty-one other things. The exhibited bright and soft nylon filaments of various colors, socks, car shells, rubber tires, etc., if you don’t look at the explanation, you simply cannot associate them with that earthy-colored lignite. The output of lignite in the German Democratic Republic accounts for half of the world's total, ranking first in the world. This is a coal of inferior quality, but the working people of the German Democratic Republic not only use it as a raw material for the chemical industry, but also built the world's only Lauchhammer coking plant that uses lignite to make coke, breaking the tradition that only high-quality hard coal can be used to make coke. This incident shows the wisdom of the German working people and also shows the great efforts they have made to overcome the shortage of industrial raw materials. As everyone knows, the eastern part of Germany, where the German Democratic Republic is located, accounted for a small proportion of Germany's heavy industry before the war. Coupled with the destruction of the war, the industrial base was weak after the war, and there was also a lack of raw materials such as steel, hard coal, and oil for the development of heavy industry. However, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working people of the German Democratic Republic have built a powerful industrial country in the past ten years with the help of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The chemical industry has developed even more rapidly, with more than 1,100 factories, and its products per capita account for the second largest in the world. The film shown at the exhibition shows the scale of the chemical industry in the German Democratic Republic. It manufactures plastics and rubber for industry, fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture, and also beautifies and enriches people's lives, from various silks, furs, and carpets woven from man-made fibers to artificial gemstones, which are truly dazzling. And the main raw material of the chemical industry in the German Democratic Republic is lignite. Therefore, people say that lignite is the gold of the German Democratic Republic.

		The Source of Great Achievements

While introducing the tremendous achievements of the German Democratic Republic, the exhibition also introduced the source of these achievements - the activities of the German working-class political party. People can see the photos of the leaders of the German workers' movement, such as Liebknecht, Luxemburg, and Thälmann, and also see the majestic steps of the people following the guidance of the Socialist Unity Party. The Socialist Unity Party leads the people to stand firmly in the socialist family. At the exhibition, you can see how the proletarian internationalist ties closely link the German Democratic Republic with the socialist countries. Here, we can see photos of the leaders of China and Germany together, see Chinese students studying in the German Democratic Republic, see German working people gathering to protest against the war provocations of American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait, and also see the precious gifts given to our people by our German brothers - mobile film projection vehicles.

At the exhibition, you can also see photos and works of great German poets such as Goethe, Schiller, and Heine. More than a hundred years ago, Heine passionately expressed the beautiful ideals of the German people in his poems:

"We want to live happily on earth,
We don't want to go hungry anymore,
We want to build a kingdom of heaven on earth..."

This exhibition tells us that the ideals in Heine's poems have been realized on the land of the German Democratic Republic!

    和平和社会主义的光辉
    ——记德意志民主共和国十年成就展览会
    古老的故宫文华殿前秋叶满地，来自易北河畔的德意志民主共和国兄弟的十年成就展览会，却给这里平添一片春光。这个展览会自从10月6日开幕以来，在二十多天中，已吸引了无数观众，给人们留下了深刻的印象。
              和平鸽代替了凶恶的鹰
    在展览会正厅中央，鲜红色的背景和金黄色国徽旁边，伫立着一只白鸽。这只鸽子昂首挺胸，洁白无瑕。仔细看看四周，你会发现这只白鸽的影子罩在许多张照片上，也罩在皮克总统宣布德意志民主共和国成立的具有历史意义的照片上。那是1949年10月，在新中国诞生后的一星期，我们的德国兄弟就在易北河畔德国三分之一的土地上，建起了劳动人民当家作主的国家。从此，在德国历史上的两只凶恶的鹰徽被和平鸽代替了。这两只凶鹰，一只是德意志帝国的国徽黑鹰，在它的标志下发动了第一次世界大战；另一只是希特勒的带有“卐”字的鹰，在它的标志下发动了第二次世界大战。照片上那战火和废墟，集中营的铁丝网和绞架，使人惊心动魄，不过，它们已经随着凶鹰一起一去不复返了。在马克思主义创始人的祖国，工农第一次掌握了政权，凶鹰再也不能张牙舞爪地摧残人民。德意志民主共和国的人民正在和平鸽的标志下为幸福的未来而斗争。
    但是，西方占领者和德国垄断资本在西德勾结起来了，在坦克阴影下的这张照片，清楚地说明他们要把西德引向何方。在那里，当初垂涎苏联乌拉尔的人们复活了，他们实行军国主义备战政策，不断向和平民主的德意志民主共和国进行挑衅和破坏活动。劳动人民的决心和力量是动摇不了的。你看，照片上那肩上站着一只和平鸽、手执斧头的工人多么坚定有力，他会把任何战争和破坏阴谋打得粉碎。何况同德意志民主共和国人民站在一起的还有以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营。所以，十年来虽然有来自西德的各种挑衅，但是劳动人民在德国的东部胜利地建设着自己的国家，使马克思主义思想在这个新的国家里开花结实。
                飞速前进的十年
    照片简捷明了地向人们介绍了德意志民主共和国十年来的巨大变化和成就。农民分得容克地主的土地、钉地界木桩的照片多么吸引人啊！然后，那些像千百块碎布缝的百家衣似的小块土地联成大片了，拖拉机在一望无际的田野上耕作。现在，合作社的耕地面积已经占全国40％以上。工业更不用说。那双翼向后的152型喷气式中程客机模型的矫健姿态，不正表现出飞速前进的十年么。共和国成立的十年来，新建和重建了一千多个工厂，兴建了许多新的工业部门，如农业机器和电机制造业，航空工业和造船业都是。造船业制造的万吨货轮，现在已经航行在德意志民主共和国—中国的航线上了。
    展览会上有一台制塑料盒子的机器。把各种颜色的塑料粉末倒在模子里，一分多钟就可压制成漂亮的小盒。人们看着这光泽美丽的盒子不禁要问，它们的原料是什么？是褐煤。从褐煤中不仅能提炼塑料，还能提炼汽油、润滑油、石蜡、合成纤维、颜料、酒精、肥料、胶卷等二十一种东西。展出的那鲜艳柔软的各色尼龙丝、衣袜、汽车外壳、橡胶轮胎等，如果不看说明，你简直不能把它们同那块发泥土色的褐煤联系在一起。褐煤在德意志民主共和国的产量占世界的一半，居世界第一。这是一种质量较差的煤，但是德意志民主共和国的劳动人民不但利用它作为化学工业的原料，还建成了世界上唯一的用褐煤炼焦的劳赫哈麦尔炼焦厂，打破了只能用优质硬煤炼焦的传统。这件事说明德国劳动人民的智慧，也说明他们为克服工业原料不足所作的重大努力。大家知道，德意志民主共和国所在的德国东部，战前在德国重工业上占的比例较小，加上战争的破坏，战后工业基础是薄弱的，而且还缺乏钢铁、硬煤、石油等发展重工业的原料。可是德国统一社会党领导下的德意志民主共和国的劳动人民，在苏联和其他社会主义国家帮助下，十年来已建成了强大的工业国家。化学工业更是突飞猛进，它已拥有一千一百多个工厂，它的产品按人口平均已占世界第二位。展览会上放映的影片，显示出德意志民主共和国的化学工业的规模，它制造工业用的塑料和橡胶，制造农业用的化肥和农药，同时也美化和丰富人们的生活，从用人造纤维织成的各种绸缎、毛皮和地毯到人造宝石，真是琳琅满目。而德意志民主共和国的化学工业的主要原料正是褐煤。因此人们说，褐煤就是德意志民主共和国的黄金。
                巨大成就的源泉
    展览会在介绍德意志民主共和国的巨大成就时，也介绍了这些成就的源泉——德国工人阶级政党的活动。人们可以看到德国工人运动的领袖李卜克内西、卢森堡、台尔曼等人的照片，也可以看到人民跟随统一社会党的指引前进的雄壮步伐。统一社会党领导人民坚定地站在社会主义大家庭内。在展览会上，可以看到无产阶级国际主义纽带把德意志民主共和国怎样密切地同社会主义国家联在了一起。我们在这里可以看到中德两国领导人在一起的照片，可以看到在德意志民主共和国学习的中国留学生，可以看到德国劳动人民集会抗议美帝国主义在台湾海峡的战争挑衅的情景，还可以看到德国兄弟送给我国人民的珍贵礼品——流动电影放映车。
    在展览会上还可以看到伟大的德国诗人哥德、席勒、海涅等人的照片和作品。一百多年前，海涅在他的诗里热情的表达了德国人民的美丽的理想：
    “我们要在地上幸福生活，
    我们再也不要挨饿，
    我们要在地上建立起天国……”
    这个展览会告诉我们，海涅诗中的理想，已经在德意志民主共和国的土地上实现了！
