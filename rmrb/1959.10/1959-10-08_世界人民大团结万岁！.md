    Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World!
    Qiao Guanhua
    We are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the People's Republic of China.
    For the past ten years, imperialism, primarily U.S. imperialism, has tried every possible means to isolate us, attempting to separate the Chinese people from the people of the world. However, contrary to the wishes of imperialism, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have greatly strengthened and developed their unity and friendship with the people of all countries in the world through a series of joint struggles. Now, our friends are all over the world. It is not the Chinese people who are isolated, but imperialism itself.
    The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the brilliant achievements in construction are inseparable from the sympathy and support of the people of the world for the Chinese people. On the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "In the era of imperialism, it is impossible for any genuine people's revolution in any country to achieve its own victory without assistance in various forms from international revolutionary forces. Even if victory is won, it cannot be consolidated." ① Therefore, Chairman Mao Zedong taught us that we must "unite in a common struggle with those nations which treat us as equals and with the people of all countries. That is, unite with the Soviet Union, unite with all new democratic countries, unite with the proletariat and the broad masses of the people of other countries, and form an international united front." ② We have done this for ten years. We have achieved great success.
    The unity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the unity between communist parties and workers' parties of all countries with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as the center are the core of all broader international unity. Among them, the close unity and friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union are particularly important. Imperialism tries its best to undermine this unity. Our task is to defend this unity as we protect our own eyes.
    Not long after the founding of the People's Republic of China, China and the Soviet Union formed a great alliance. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "The unity of the people of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by treaty, will be permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it. This unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world." ③ The facts of the past ten years have proved that the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union are the most reliable guarantee for world peace and human progress.
    U.S. imperialism, unwilling to accept its defeat on the Chinese mainland, launched a war of aggression against Korea. This was an attack on the Korean people and the Chinese people. It was also an attack on the entire socialist camp. With the support of the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and the support of the people of all countries in the world, the Chinese people, together with the Korean people, repelled the attack of the U.S. aggressors after three years of heroic struggle. This was a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people. This was a great victory for the entire socialist camp. U.S. imperialism was battered and bruised on the impregnable wall of socialism, which forced it to ease international tensions, especially tensions in the East. This greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of all countries in the world for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.
    U.S. imperialism's failure to attack the eastern part of the socialist camp led it to exploit the counter-revolutionary riots of domestic reactionary forces in Hungary, attempting to open a gap in the western part of the socialist camp. The Chinese people, together with the people of socialist countries, resolutely supported the Soviet Union in assisting the Hungarian people to suppress the riots, and the imperialist conspiracy suffered another shameful failure. Proletarian internationalism once again shone brightly. Contrary to the wishes of imperialism and all reactionaries, Hungary was not weakened but strengthened after this incident, and the entire socialist camp was more consolidated and united. The international communist movement has developed further.
    The meeting of communist and workers' parties of all countries held in Moscow in 1957 opened a new stage in the unity of the international communist movement. The Moscow Declaration summarized the experience of the international communist movement over the past century, especially the past forty years, correctly clarified a series of major current issues, and greatly strengthened the political and ideological foundation for the unity of the international communist movement. The Chinese people warmly support the Moscow Conference and its declaration and unswervingly regard strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement as their sacred international obligation.
    The Chinese people, together with communist and workers' parties of all countries in the world, waged a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the Yugoslav modern revisionists, exposing their essence of betraying Marxism and serving imperialism. This struggle purified the ranks of world communism and strengthened the combat effectiveness of communist and workers' parties of all countries. The imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the unity of the international communist movement and the socialist camp from within was resolutely repelled.
    The socialist camp is unassailable and unbreakable. The twelve socialist countries are connected in a single piece in Europe and Asia, forming an invincible and powerful fortress from the Elbe River to the 38th parallel, from Moscow to Hanoi. The era of imperialism encircling socialism is gone forever. In the new historical conditions of the growing strength of the socialist camp and the vigorous development of the national liberation movement, it is imperialism itself that is being encircled.
    The Chinese revolution opened a large gap in the imperialist front in the East, dealing a fatal blow to the imperialist colonial system. As early as when the Chinese revolution began to turn to victory, Chairman Mao Zedong foresaw this: "The reason why this event is of great significance is that this event occurred in a country with a population of 450 million. Once this event occurs, it will inevitably move towards victory throughout the country. The reason why this event is of great significance is also because this event occurred in the East, where more than one billion people (half of mankind) are suffering from imperialist oppression. The Chinese people's war of liberation, from defense to offense, cannot but arouse the joy and encouragement of these oppressed nations. At the same time, it is also an assistance to the oppressed people of Europe and the Americas who are struggling." ④ The course of events fully confirmed Chairman Mao Zedong's prediction. The victory of the Chinese revolution greatly encouraged the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The victorious Chinese people feel particularly close to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Chinese people see their own yesterday in all oppressed nations. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America applaud the victorious Chinese people, and all oppressed nations see their own tomorrow in the victory of the Chinese people.
    The Chinese people have stood up. The power of the people who have stood up is infinite. For a long time, U.S. imperialism has created the myth of American invincibility as an important spiritual weapon for its hegemony in the world and enslavement of mankind. Indeed, among many people in the world, there is a superstition that the United States is terrible. The great victory of the Chinese people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea punctured the U.S. paper tiger, overthrew the myth of American invincibility, and dispelled the superstition that the United States cannot be touched. For the millions upon millions of nations and people who are still under the oppression and enslavement of U.S. imperialism, this is a spiritual liberation of historical significance. If the number one imperialist in the world today, the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, can be overthrown and defeated, then what imperialist rule, aggression, and interference in the world cannot be overthrown and defeated by the people?
    Imperialism thought that we could not survive without them. The rapid progress of China's socialist construction over the past ten years, especially the great leap forward in the past two years, has completely dashed the hopes of imperialism. Without imperialism, we can not only survive but also live better. The Chinese people have found a way to quickly get rid of poverty and backwardness. This cannot but be very attractive to the people of all backward countries that have suffered or are suffering from imperialist oppression.
    The Chinese people and the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries support each other in the common struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people, together with the people of socialist countries, firmly support the national independence and liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We support the Egyptian people's struggle against British and French aggression. We support the Iraqi people's struggle against foreign interference. We support the Algerian people's struggle against colonial rule. We support the Cuban people's struggle to defend the fruits of the revolution and oppose U.S. interference. Whether in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, any just struggle for national independence, to defend national independence, against interference, or against aggression has received the sympathy and support of the Chinese people. At the same time, the Chinese people have also received the sympathy and support of the broad masses of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in a series of struggles such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, opposing the U.S. occupation of Taiwan, and restoring China's legitimate status in international conferences. The unity and friendship between us are established and developed in the common struggle and are unbreakable.
    China and Asian and African nationalist countries are countries of two completely different natures, but we all have the demands to oppose war, maintain peace, oppose imperialism, defend national independence, eradicate the scourge of colonialism, and develop national economy and culture. Based on these common demands, common aspirations for friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence have emerged. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence reflect these demands and aspirations and have been universally welcomed and supported by the people of Asian and African countries. Our government has greatly developed friendly cooperative relations with Asian and African countries based on the Five Principles. The development of this relationship is beneficial to the unity and friendship between the Chinese people and the Asian and African people, and it is only detrimental to imperialism. Imperialism tries to use the right-wingers of nationalist countries to undermine the friendly relations between these countries and China and other socialist countries. However, their destructive activities can only expose their true colors in front of the broad masses of the people and be spurned by the people. The main stream of unity and friendship between the Chinese people and the Asian and African people cannot be destroyed.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution strongly supported the struggles of the oppressed people in Europe and the Americas.
    If the October Revolution built a bridge between the proletariat in the West and the oppressed nations in the East, the Chinese revolution thoroughly shook the imperialist colonial system in the East through this bridge and further connected the victorious Chinese people and all the victorious Eastern people with the struggling Western people. The victory of the great Chinese revolution itself is a historically significant aid to the oppressed people of Europe and the Americas who are struggling. When the oppressed nations in the East are liberated, the day of liberation for the people in the West cannot be far away.
    The victorious Chinese people are doing everything possible to support the struggle of the oppressed people in Western countries for peace, democracy, progress, and socialism. We regard their struggle as our own struggle. The proletariat, working people, and all peace-loving people in Western countries, although still in extremely difficult circumstances, have also made great efforts to support us. The Chinese people cannot forget the struggle of the American people, the British people, and the people of all countries in the world against U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea, occupation of Taiwan, and expansion of aggression against Jinmen and Mazu. This is a manifestation of a great internationalist spirit.
    Imperialist policies of aggression and war have mobilized the people of all countries in the world. The people of the world, regardless of race, political views, and religious beliefs, are becoming more and more widely united in the movement against war and for the maintenance of peace. The Chinese people resolutely stand on the front line of defending peace with the people of the world. We actively respond to every call and initiative of the world peace movement. In defending peace, we have a common language with the vast majority of people in the world. Through the peace movement, we have established and developed extremely broad contacts with the people of all countries in the world. Over the past ten years, the unity between the Chinese people and the people of the world in the peace movement has greatly developed and will have even greater development in the future.
    The people of the world regard the victory of the Chinese people as a gospel. However, Western imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, regards the victory of the Chinese revolution as a disaster. For them, the Chinese revolution is a great "plague." They are trying every possible means to limit this "plague" to the smallest possible extent.
    From the failure of the Korean War, U.S. imperialism began to realize that the new People's China could not be invaded and could not be overthrown by force. It insisted on occupying Chinese territory Taiwan, organized the Southeast Asia military bloc, and actively revived Japanese militarism, establishing a series of military bases around China, militarily encircling New China. It does not recognize the People's Republic of China and deprives the People's Republic of China of its legitimate status in the United Nations and other international organizations and international conferences. It not only does this itself but also forces many countries to do so. U.S. imperialism insists that only the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan under its bayonet protection represents China, and that the People's Republic of China, representing 650 million Chinese people, does not exist. This absurd policy of not recognizing New China has aroused more and more dissatisfaction and opposition from countries and people. In order to get rid of this difficulty and permanently occupy Taiwan, U.S. imperialism has also instigated a conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Every achievement New China has made in socialist construction, especially the great leap forward and the great movement of people's communes in 1958, has aroused U.S. imperialism's unparalleled fear and deep hatred. It has launched a wave of slander against New China. It uses every opportunity to provoke the friendly relations between China and Asian and African countries. U.S. imperialism attempts to use these methods to limit the influence of the Chinese revolution and sever the connection between the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    However, everything U.S. imperialism does is bound to go to its opposite and has already begun to go to its opposite. Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. If the United States does not withdraw from Taiwan, they will be driven out one day. The military bases and military blocs surrounding New China cannot shake a hair of the Chinese people but can only arouse the people of the countries concerned to rise up and bury U.S. imperialism together with the Chinese people. The Chinese people firmly oppose "two Chinas." The U.S. policy of non-recognition cannot harm a hair of New China. The Chinese people do not care about U.S. recognition. We do not care at all if U.S. imperialism does not recognize China for a hundred years. All the rumors, slanders, and provocations that U.S. imperialism has carried out against China will prove that what the Chinese people have done is correct and just. Our people have done a good job and have achieved great success. U.S. imperialism has become a negative teacher for the Chinese people and the people of the world. The more U.S. imperialism opposes, the more attractive New China becomes. The influence of the great Chinese revolution cannot be limited, and the connection between the Chinese people and the people of the world cannot be severed. Contrary to the wishes of imperialism and all reactionaries, the influence of the Chinese revolution and construction has expanded over the past ten years, and the exchanges and connections between the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world have been strengthened a hundredfold through various channels.
    Over the past ten years, the Chinese people, under the glorious banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, have done a series of work to unite the people of all countries in the world and have achieved great success. In the future, we will continue to work tirelessly to consolidate the socialist camp, unite the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and unite all the people of all countries in the world who are striving for peace and progress. With the support of the united people of the world, our cause is invincible. In front of the united people of the world, the imperialists are just a small handful of clowns who will enter the grave sooner or later.
    Long live peace, democracy, and socialism!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

    世界人民大团结万岁！
    乔冠华
    我们伟大的祖国中华人民共和国成立十周年了。
    十年来，帝国主义主要是美帝国主义千方百计孤立我们，妄想把中国人民和世界人民隔绝开来。但是，和帝国主义的愿望相反，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，经过一系列的共同斗争，大大加强和发展了同世界各国人民的团结和友谊。现在，我们的朋友遍于全世界。被孤立了的不是中国人民，而是帝国主义自己。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利和建设的辉煌成就，是同全世界人民对中国人民的同情和支持分不开的。在中华人民共和国成立的前夕，毛泽东主席就指出：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。”①因此，毛泽东主席教导我们，必须“联合世界上以平等待我之民族及各国人民，共同奋斗。这就是联合苏联、联合各新民主国家、联合其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民，结成国际的统一战线”。②十年来，我们这样做了。我们取得了很大的成就。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的团结和以苏联共产党为中心的各国共产党和工人党之间的团结，是一切更广泛的国际团结的核心。在这当中，中苏两国人民的亲密团结和友好合作，尤其具有重要意义。帝国主义挖空心思要破坏这种团结。我们的任务就是要像保护自己的眼珠一样来保卫这种团结。
    中华人民共和国成立不久，中苏两国就结成了伟大的同盟。正如毛泽东主席之所指出：“业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”③十年来的事实证明，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结和合作，是世界和平和人类进步事业的最可靠的保证。
    美帝国主义不甘心于它在中国大陆的失败，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。这是对朝鲜人民和中国人民的进攻。这也是对整个社会主义阵营的进攻。中国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的支持之下，在世界各国人民的支持之下，同朝鲜人民一道，经过三年的英勇斗争，击退了美国侵略者的进攻。这是朝中人民的伟大胜利。这是整个社会主义阵营的伟大胜利。美帝国主义在社会主义的铜墙铁壁上碰得头破血流，这就迫使它不能不缓和一下国际紧张局势，特别是东方的紧张局势。这就极大地鼓舞了世界各国人民争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的斗争。
    美帝国主义对社会主义阵营东方的进攻失败，转而利用匈牙利国内反动势力的反革命暴乱，企图在社会主义阵营的西方打开缺口。中国人民同社会主义各国人民一道，坚决支持苏联协助匈牙利人民镇压暴乱，使帝国主义的阴谋遭到了又一次可耻的失败。无产阶级国际主义又一次发出了灿烂的火花。同帝国主义和一切反动派的愿望相反，经过了这次事件，匈牙利不是削弱，而是更强了，整个社会主义阵营更加巩固地团结起来了。国际共产主义运动更向前发展了。
    1957年在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党的会议，开始了国际共产主义运动的团结的一个新阶段。莫斯科宣言总结了一百年来特别是近四十年来国际共产主义运动的经验，正确地阐明了一系列当前的重大的问题，大大地加强了国际共产主义运动的团结的政治思想基础。中国人民热烈地拥护莫斯科会议和它的宣言，并坚持不渝地把加强社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结，当成自己的神圣的国际义务。
    中国人民同世界各国共产党和工人党一道，对南斯拉夫现代修正主义者进行了坚决的、不调和的斗争，揭穿了他们叛变马克思主义、为帝国主义效劳的实质。这个斗争纯洁了世界共产主义的队伍，加强了各国共产党和工人党的战斗力。帝国主义者从内部来破坏国际共产主义运动和社会主义阵营的团结的阴谋遭到了坚决的回击。
    社会主义阵营是碰不倒、攻不破的。十二个社会主义国家在欧亚两洲连成一片，从易北河到“三八线”，从莫斯科到河内，形成了一个不可战胜的、强大的堡垒。帝国主义包围社会主义的时代已经一去不复返了。在社会主义阵营日益壮大和民族解放运动蓬勃发展的新的历史条件下，被包围的是帝国主义自己。
    中国革命把帝国主义在东方的战线上打开了一个很大的缺口，使帝国主义的殖民制度受到了致命的打击。还在中国革命开始转向胜利的时候，毛泽东主席即预见到这一点：“这个事变所以带着伟大性，是因为这个事变发生在一个具有四万万五千万人口的国家内，这个事变一经发生，它就将必然地走向全国的胜利。这个事变所以带着伟大性，还因为这个事变发生在世界的东方，在这里，共有十万万以上人口（占人类的一半）遭受帝国主义的压迫，中国人民的解放战争，由防御转到进攻，不能不引起这些被压迫民族的欢欣鼓舞。同时，对于正在斗争的欧洲与美洲各国的被压迫人民，也是一种援助。”④事件的过程完全证实了毛泽东主席的预见。中国革命的胜利、极大地鼓舞了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫民族的解放斗争。胜利了的中国人民对亚、非、拉丁美洲各国人民感到特别亲切，中国人民在一切被压迫民族的身上看到自己的昨天。亚、非、拉丁美洲各国人民鼓掌欢迎胜利了的中国人民，一切被压迫民族在中国人民的胜利中看到自己的明天。
    中国人民站起来了。站起来的人民的力量是无穷的。长时期以来，美帝国主义就制造了美国无敌的神话，作为它称霸世界奴役人类的一个重要精神武器。在世界上不少人中间也确实存在着美国很可怕的迷信。中国人民抗美援朝的伟大胜利，戳穿了美国纸老虎，推翻了美国无敌的神话，破除了美国碰不得的迷信。对于千千万万现在仍然处于美帝国主义的压迫和奴役之下的民族和人民，这是一个具有历史意义的精神大解放。如果当今头号帝国主义、世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义可以被推翻，可以被打败，那末，世界上还有什么帝国主义的统治、侵略和干涉不能被人民推翻和打败的呢？
    帝国主义以为我们离开了他们，就活不下去，十年来，中国社会主义建设的突飞猛进，特别是最近两年来的大跃进，使帝国主义的指望完全落空。没有帝国主义，我们不仅能够活下去，而且活得更好。中国人民找到了一条迅速摆脱贫穷和落后的道路。这不能不对一切曾经遭受过、或者正在遭受着帝国主义压迫的落后国家的人民具有很大的吸引力。
    中国人民和亚、非、拉丁美洲各国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中互相支援。中国人民和社会主义各国人民一道，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立和解放运动。我们支持埃及人民抵抗英法侵略的斗争。我们支持伊拉克人民反对外国干涉的斗争。我们支持阿尔及利亚人民反抗殖民统治的斗争。我们支持古巴人民保卫革命果实、反对美国干涉的斗争。不论是在亚洲、非洲或者拉丁美洲，任何一种争取民族独立、保卫民族独立、反对干涉或者反对侵略的正义斗争，都得到了中国人民的同情和支持。同时，中国人民在抗美援朝、反对美国霸占台湾、恢复中国在国际会议中的合法地位等一系列的斗争中也得到了亚、非、拉丁美洲广大人民的同情和支持。我们之间的团结和友谊是在共同斗争中建立和发展起来的，是牢不可破的。
    中国和亚非民族主义国家是两种性质完全不同的国家，但是我们都有反对战争、维护和平，反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立，根除殖民主义祸害、发展民族经济和文化的要求。在这些共同要求的基础上，产生了友好合作与和平共处的共同愿望。关于和平共处的五项原则，反映了这些要求和愿望，受到了亚非各国人民的普遍欢迎和支持。我国政府根据五项原则大大地发展了同亚非国家之间的友好合作关系。这种关系的发展有利于中国人民同亚非人民之间的团结和友谊，而仅仅不利于帝国主义。帝国主义力图利用民族主义国家的右派破坏这些国家同中国和其他社会主义国家的友好关系。但是，他们的破坏活动只能在广大人民群众的面前暴露他们自己的真面目，而为人民所唾弃；中国人民和亚非人民团结友好的主流是破坏不了的。
    中国革命的胜利，强有力地支持了欧洲和美洲各国的被压迫人民的斗争。
    如果十月革命是在西方的无产阶级和东方的被压迫民族之间架起了一座桥梁的话，中国革命则是通过这座桥梁彻底动摇了帝国主义的东方殖民体系，把胜利的中国人民和胜利的一切东方人民同斗争着的西方人民进一步联系起来。伟大中国革命的胜利，本身就是对正在斗争的欧洲和美洲各国被压迫人民的一个具有重大历史意义的援助。东方被压迫民族解放了，西方人民解放的日子是不可能很远的。
    胜利了的中国人民竭尽一切可能支援西方各国被压迫人民争取和平、民主、进步和社会主义的斗争。我们把他们的斗争看成是我们自己的斗争。西方各国的无产阶级、劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民，虽然目前还处于极端困难的情况下，也作了极大的努力来支援我们。中国人民不能忘记美国人民、英国人民和世界各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、霸占台湾和扩大侵略金门马祖的斗争。这是一种伟大的国际主义精神的表现。
    帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策动员了世界各国人民。世界人民不分种族、政治观点和宗教信仰在反对战争、维护和平的运动中日益广泛地团结起来。中国人民坚决地同世界人民站在维护和平的前线。我们积极响应世界和平运动的每一个号召和倡议。在保卫和平中，我们有着同全世界绝大多数人民的共同语言。通过和平运动，我们同世界各国人民建立并发展了极其广泛的联系。十年来，中国人民同世界人民在和平运动中的团结已经有了很大的发展，今后还将有更大的发展。
    世界人民把中国人民的胜利看作是一个福音。但是，西方帝国主义特别是美帝国主义却把中国革命的胜利当做是一种灾难，对于他们说来，中国革命是一场大“瘟疫”。他们想尽一切办法，要把这种“瘟疫”限制在最小可能的范围之内。
    美帝国主义从朝鲜战争的失败中，开始认识到新生的人民中国是打不进去的，用武力推翻不了的。它坚持占领中国领土台湾，组织东南亚军事集团，并且积极复活日本军国主义，在中国的周围建立起一系列的军事基地，从军事上包围新中国。它不承认中华人民共和国，剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国和其他一些国际组织、国际会议中的合法地位。它不仅自己这样做，还强迫许多国家也这样做。美帝国主义硬说只有在它的刺刀保护下的台湾蒋介石集团才代表中国，代表六亿五千万中国人民的中华人民共和国是不存在的。这个荒谬的不承认新中国的政策，引起了越来越多的国家和人民的不满和反对。为了摆脱这种困难和永久霸占台湾，美帝国主义又策动制造“两个中国”的阴谋。新中国在社会主义建设中所取得的每一项成就，特别是1958年中国人民的大跃进和人民公社化的伟大运动，引起了美帝国主义的无比恐惧和深刻仇恨。它掀起了一个诬蔑新中国的浪潮。它利用一切机会挑拨中国和亚非国家之间的友好关系。美帝国主义企图用这些办法来限制中国革命的影响，割断中国人民和世界人民的联系。
    但是，美帝国主义所做的一切，必然要走向它的反面，而且已经开始走向它的反面。台湾是中国的领土。中国人民一定要解放台湾。如果美国不撤出台湾，它们总有一天是要被赶出去的。包围着新中国的军事基地和军事集团，动摇不了中国人民的一根毫毛，而只能激起有关各国的人民起来同中国人民一道，共同埋葬美帝国主义。中国人民坚决反对“两个中国”。美国的不承认政策，也根本不能损害新中国的一根毫毛。中国人民完全不希罕美国的承认。美国一百年不承认中国，我们根本不在乎。美帝国主义对中国所进行的一切造谣诬蔑和挑拨离间，都将证明中国人民的所作所为是正确的，正义的；我国人民做得很好，做得很有成就。美帝国主义当了中国人民和世界人民的反面教员。美帝国主义越反对，新中国就越具有吸引力。伟大的中国革命的影响是限制不住的，中国人民同世界人民的联系是割不断的。同帝国主义和一切反动派的愿望相反，十年来中国革命和建设的影响扩大了，中国人民通过各种途径同世界各国人民的来往和联系千百倍地加强了。
    十年来，中国人民在争取和平、民主、和社会主义的光辉旗帜下，为团结世界各国人民做了一系列的工作，取得了很大的成就。今后我们还将继续为巩固社会主义阵营，团结亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民和团结全世界一切争取和平和进步的各国人民而努力不懈。在团结一致的世界人民的支持之下，我们的事业是无往不胜的。在团结一致的世界人民面前，帝国主义者不过是一小撮早晚就要进坟墓的跳梁小丑而已。
    和平、民主、社会主义万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
