    Watching the "Swan Lake" at the Soviet Bolshoi Theatre
    Dai Ailian
    "Swan Lake" is one of the most popular classical ballets. From 1954 to the present, for five years, Chinese audiences have been fortunate enough to see three distinctive performances of the play by three famous Soviet theaters. This performance by the Bolshoi Theatre Ballet of the Soviet Union is based on the traditional interpretation, and of particular note are the remarkable and exquisite skills displayed by the Bolshoi Theatre's outstanding dancers, Soviet People's Artists Maya Plisetskaya and Konstantin Sergeyev, in this ballet. It fully demonstrates the great achievements of Soviet ballet art.
    In our country's theatrical life, there are some plays that, although the audience is very familiar with them, people often go to see the same play again and again to enjoy the performances of their favorite actors. The same is true in the Soviet Union. "Swan Lake" is already a household name, but many people want to see Plisetskaya perform the roles of the white swan Odette and the black swan Odile, two characters with distinctly different personalities, again and again. After I excitedly watched her performance this time, I deeply understood the Soviet people's love for her.
    Plisetskaya has physical conditions that are very suitable for a ballet dancer. Generally speaking, taller actors have beautiful lines because their legs are longer, but they are not as agile when performing the fastest movements. However, Plisetskaya's performance in "Swan Lake", whether in the lyrical adagio or the rapid small movements, demonstrated her comprehensive talent in technique. We know that to be an excellent actor, technique alone is not enough; there must be a profound emotional expression. I think Plisetskaya's greatest success is not only because she has fully mastered ballet technique, but more importantly, because of her appealing musicality and the delicate portrayal of the changes in the character's emotions. In "Swan Lake," she used her mature skills to perfectly embody the beautiful realm of Tchaikovsky's music. In the second act, when the prince swears to show his fidelity in love, Odette's arms tremble with happiness and excitement, making the audience unable to help but sympathize with her painful encounter, and also rejoice for the happiness she is about to receive. Then, as dawn approaches, Odette is about to turn into a swan and has to say goodbye to the prince, her reluctance to leave and the trembling of her arms, symbolizing the swan, leave such an unforgettable impression. After watching the second act, I immediately wondered what her portrayal of the black swan Odile would be like. A few days ago, I had just seen her portray the Bacchante in the "Walpurgis Night" fragment of "Faust," and I had also seen her play the Georgian girl Zarema in the movie "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai." I believed she would perform excellently. However, when I actually saw her perform Odile, I was even more convinced. When Odile appeared, the audience saw a completely different person. Her seductive expression and posture were in stark contrast to Odette's gentleness and loveliness in the second act, making it almost impossible to blame the prince for being deceived. Plisetskaya's amazing technique in expressing Odile's ecstatic mood as she is about to deceive the prince, with a series of rapid spins around the stage, is truly admirable.
    Konstantin Sergeyev, who plays the prince in "Swan Lake," is also a favorite actor of the Soviet people. Despite his older age, he has maintained a high level of skill. He not only shows rich stage experience in lifts, but also the sculptural nature of the rotation in the variation dance and the pose upon landing from the aerial double turn, which demonstrates the artistic longevity of an older actor who has undergone long-term training. Sergeyev's portrayal of the prince is delightful.
    After watching the performance of "Swan Lake," we must say that the other roles in the entire performance, such as the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Honored Artist Vladimir Levashov as the evil spirit, as well as all the white swan dances and several representative folk dances, are excellent. Here, it should also be mentioned that the orchestra's performance fully demonstrated their deep understanding and excellent interpretation of Tchaikovsky's beautiful ballet music.
    The Soviet Bolshoi Theatre Ballet's performance of "Swan Lake" is a rare artistic enjoyment for the audience in our capital, and also the best learning model for our ballet workers.

    看苏联大剧院的“天鹅湖”
    戴爱莲
    “天鹅湖”是古典芭蕾中最受观众欢迎的剧目之一。从1954年到现在，五年来中国观众幸运地看到了苏联三个著名剧院各有特色的三种演出。苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团这一次的演出，是根据传统的演法来处理的，特别引人注意的是大剧院杰出的舞蹈家玛·米·普利谢茨卡娅和康·米·谢尔盖耶夫两位苏联人民演员，在这个舞剧中所显示出来的令人惊异的精湛演技。它充分地表明了苏联芭蕾艺术的伟大成就。
    在我们国家的戏剧生活中，有些剧目虽然是观众非常熟悉的，人们却常常为了欣赏自己喜爱的演员的表演，一次又一次地去看同一剧目的演出。在苏联也是一样，“天鹅湖”已经是家喻户晓的剧目，可是很多人却因为普利谢茨卡娅在剧中成功地扮演了白天鹅奥杰塔和黑天鹅奥杰丽亚这两个截然不同性格的角色而要一看再看。当我兴奋地看了她这一次的演出以后，使我深深地体会了苏联人民对她的这种热爱。
    普利谢茨卡娅有着很适合于芭蕾演员的形体条件。一般的说，个子较高的演员因为腿比较长线条很美，但是在做最快速度的动作时也不容易灵活。然而，普利谢茨卡娅在“天鹅湖”中的表演，不论是抒情的慢板，还是急速的小动作，都表现了她在技巧上的全面才能。我们知道，作为一个优秀的演员，光有技巧是不够的，必须有深刻的感情体现。我认为普利谢茨卡娅最成功的，不仅仅因为她全面地掌握了芭蕾技巧，更重要的是她那吸引人的音乐感和人物感情变化的细致刻划。在“天鹅湖”中，她运用了成熟的技巧，完美地体现了柴可夫斯基音乐中的美妙境界。当第二幕，王子为了表示爱情的忠贞宣誓的时候，奥杰塔充满幸福、冲动地颤动着两臂，使观众情不自禁地同情她的痛苦遭遇，同时也为她将要得到的幸福而欢乐。接着，天快亮了，奥杰塔马上就要变成天鹅不得不向王子告别时，她那离去的恋恋不舍的神情，和象征天鹅的双臂的颤动给人留下了多么难忘的印象。看完第二幕，使我立即想到她演的黑天鹅奥杰丽亚又会是什么样子呢？前几天我刚看过她在“浮士德”的片断“瓦利普尔吉那之夜”中扮演的瓦克汉卡，过去也曾在电影“巴赫契萨拉伊的喷泉”中看过她演的格鲁吉亚姑娘扎列玛，我相信她会演得出色的。但是，等我真正看了她演的奥杰丽亚，就更令人信服了。奥杰丽亚一出场，观众看到的完全是另外一个人了，她那富有诱惑力的表情和姿态，同第二幕中奥杰塔的温柔可爱恰恰成了鲜明的对照，使人几乎不能责怪王子会受骗。普利谢茨卡娅在表现奥杰丽亚快要将王子骗到手的狂喜心情，绕着舞台一周的急速连转的惊人技巧，令人赞叹不已。
    在“天鹅湖”中扮演王子的康·米·谢尔盖耶夫也是苏联人民最喜爱的演员。尽管他的年龄较长，却保持了很高的技巧水平。他不但在托举时显露出丰富的舞台经验，特别是在变奏舞中的旋转，和空中双转落地时的姿态的富有雕塑性，说明了一个经过长期锻炼的年长演员的艺术常青。谢尔盖耶夫扮演的王子是使人欢喜的。
    看了“天鹅湖”的演出，我们不能不说整个演出中，其他如扮演恶魔的俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋演员弗·亚·列瓦绍夫，以及所有的白天鹅的舞蹈和几个代表性民间舞都是出色的。在这里，还应该提出的是乐队的演奏充分地表现了他们对柴可夫斯基这部优美的舞剧音乐的深刻理解，和很好的解释。
    苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团演出的“天鹅湖”，是我国首都观众一次难得的艺术享受，也是我国芭蕾舞工作者最好的学习榜样。
