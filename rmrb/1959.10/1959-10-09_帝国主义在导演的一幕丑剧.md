    A Farce Directed by Imperialism

    Since the suppression of the armed rebellion by the reactionary upper strata in Tibet, the imperialists and foreign reactionary forces have never given up their attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs. In addition to using newspapers, radio stations, and various conference platforms to attack and slander China, they have planned in various ways to stage the farce of the so-called "Tibetan issue" in the United Nations. On the third day of the opening of the 14th UN General Assembly, US Secretary of State Herter clamored about "the Chinese Communist Party's brutal suppression of the basic human rights of Tibetans," "causing the extinction of the Tibetan people," and so on, and said in a commanding tone: "This is a matter of deep concern to the United Nations. This organization must, of course, express its attitude in clear terms when faced with this situation." Then the British representative also came out to echo him. Under the direction of the imperialists, Ireland and Malaya finally requested the General Affairs Committee of the UN to discuss the so-called Tibetan issue on September 28, and distributed a proposal on October 7. This is another serious conspiracy by US imperialism to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs, antagonize the Chinese people, poison the international atmosphere, and create tension.

    The reason why US imperialism does this is not only because it is unwilling to accept the complete failure of the Tibetan rebellion, but also because it is panic-stricken in the face of the great victories achieved by the Chinese people. For a year, US imperialism and its servants have been asserting every day that China's Great Leap Forward has failed, the people's communes have failed, and how serious China's internal difficulties are, and so on. But all the rumors and slanders have gone bankrupt. The facts that appear before them are that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the entire Chinese people, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, are continuing to leap forward with one heart and one mind, high morale, and will complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year. Our people's communes, after rectification, have embarked on a solid and sound path of development. The international prestige of the People's Republic of China is increasing day by day. The friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese people and the people of the world are constantly developing. Under this situation, US imperialism and its followers, seeing that there is nothing they can do about the great Chinese people, have to resort to their despicable tricks of slander and defamation.

    It must be pointed out that the reason why US imperialism is trying to stir up a new anti-China movement in the United Nations at this time is an important step it has taken to obstruct the trend of easing the international situation. As everyone knows, under the pressure of the people all over the world demanding the melting of the Cold War ice, the United States has had to make a gesture to ease the tense situation. However, the US monopoly groups, which rely on tense situations to make fortunes and dominate, are unwilling to easily abandon the "Cold War" policy. One of the main purposes of US imperialism's planning to discuss the so-called "Tibetan issue" in the United Nations this time is to poison the international atmosphere and create new tensions. Precisely because of this, the United States has a guilty conscience and dare not submit a proposal on the so-called "Tibetan issue" to the United Nations General Assembly in its own name. The United Press International once had the following report: "US officials believe that if the United States takes the initiative to submit the Tibetan issue to the United Nations, it will make the people of neutralist countries believe that this matter is merely a Cold War propaganda tool and will not pay attention to it." Britain, the old-brand imperialist that had long invaded Tibet, China, also felt inconvenient because the Conservative government was facing a general election. The "Times" once suggested that "it is appropriate for a Commonwealth country to propose a joint initiative." In this way, the United States and Britain actively sought countries willing to act as pawns. However, their activities were not smooth, and not many people were willing to serve them. Until recently, they had to settle for Ireland and Malaya, two servants, to act as cat's paws. This is not surprising at all. Ireland was originally a country that acted as a vanguard in the United Nations against the Soviet Union and communism. In January 1957, less than two years after Ireland entered the United Nations, its foreign minister accepted the instructions of US Cardinal Spellman and took the lead in proposing a proposal on the so-called "Hungarian issue" at the United Nations General Assembly. The Malayan government is still under the strict control of British imperialism and is pursuing a policy of hostility towards China.

    The so-called proposals of Ireland and Malaya are entirely the products of US and British imperialism, attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs with absurd excuses such as "the basic human rights of Tibetans," "civil liberties and religious freedom." However, as everyone knows, the UN Charter clearly stipulates that the United Nations has no right to interfere in matters that are purely within the domestic jurisdiction of any country. US imperialism is actively planning for the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Tibetan issue" because it is attempting to continue to use the United Nations as a shameful tool for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and implementing the "Cold War" policy. If the United Nations is allowed to proceed according to the US conspiracy, it will inevitably cause serious consequences that threaten the national independence of all countries and hinder the relaxation of the international situation.

    As for their clamoring to discuss Tibetan "freedom" and "basic human rights," it is truly the height of shamelessness. The whole world can clearly see that the Tibetan people are now overthrowing the barbaric and dark serf system and are gaining the right to be human beings. What US and British imperialism are demanding is not basic human rights, but a vain attempt to throw the Tibetan people, who have already turned themselves over, back into the dark hell. They sympathize with those overturned cruel serf owners. US and British imperialism themselves are such serf owners. They practice national oppression and racial discrimination all over the world and barbarically destroy the basic human rights of the people there. We believe that all self-respecting member states of the United Nations should strictly abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations, not fall into the US "Cold War" trap, and avoid playing a shameful role in this farce directed by the United States. Any country that serves the US imperialist "Cold War" policy and takes actions hostile to the 650 million Chinese people will only end up lifting a rock to drop it on its own feet.

    For the Chinese people, the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, has had a record of hostility towards China and aggression against Korea, and has long lost its credibility. Slandering China once again in the United Nations cannot harm the Chinese people in the slightest. No force can stop the great transformation of the Tibetan people and the victorious advance of the Chinese people's great cause of building socialism. US imperialism's anti-China agitation can only further prove one truth: US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and all oppressed people and peace-loving people in the world. For such an enemy, it is necessary to resolutely and repeatedly carry out a tit-for-tat struggle.

### 帝国主义在导演的一幕丑剧

    帝国主义在导演的一幕丑剧
    自从西藏上层反动集团的武装叛乱平定以来，帝国主义者和外国反动势力对于干涉中国内政一直没有死心。他们除了利用报刊、电台和各种会议的讲坛来攻击和诬蔑中国以外，曾多方策划要把所谓“西藏问题”这幕丑剧搬到联合国里来上演。在第十四届联合国大会开幕的第三天，美国国务卿赫脱就叫嚣什么“中国共产党残暴地镇压西藏人的基本人权”、“使藏族消灭”等等，并且用发号施令的口吻说：“这是联合国深为关切的一个问题。这个组织在碰到这种局势时，当然必须以明确的措词表明自己的态度。”接着英国的代表也出来帮腔，一唱一和。在帝国主义者的导演下，爱尔兰和马来亚终于在9月28日向联大总务委员会要求讨论所谓西藏问题，并于10月7日分发了提案。这是美帝国主义又一次企图利用联合国来干涉中国内政、敌视中国人民、毒化国际气氛和制造紧张局势的严重阴谋。
    美帝国主义之所以这样做，不仅是因为它不甘心于西藏叛乱的完全失败，而且是由于它在中国人民所取得的伟大胜利面前，惊慌失措。一年以来，美帝国主义和它的仆从，曾经天天在断言中国的大跃进失败了，人民公社失败了，中国内部困难如何严重，等等。但是一切的造谣诬蔑都破产了。出现在它们面前的事实，却是全中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，万众一心、斗志昂扬地继续跃进，将在今年提前三年超额完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。我们的人民公社经过整顿以后已经走上了巩固的健全的发展道路。中华人民共和国的国际威望与日俱增。中国人民和全世界人民的友好合作关系不断发展。在这种形势下，美帝国主义及其追随者，眼看着对伟大的中国人民无可奈何，只好施展他们卑鄙的诬蔑、诽谤的伎俩。
    必须指出，美帝国主义所以在这个时候力图在联合国内挑起新的反华运动，是它阻挠国际局势趋向和缓的一个重要步骤。尽人皆知，在全世界人民要求消融冷战冰块的压力下，美国不得不作出一点缓和紧张局势的姿态。但是，依靠紧张局势发财称霸的美国垄断集团，是不愿意轻易放弃“冷战”政策的。这一次美帝国主义策划在联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”，其主要目的之一，就在于毒化国际气氛，制造新的紧张局势。正因为如此，美国作贼心虚，不敢用自己的名义向联合国大会提出关于所谓“西藏问题”的提案。合众国际社曾经有过下面的报道：“美国官员们认为，如果美国采取主动，把西藏问题提交联合国，那就会使中立主义国家的人民认为这件事仅仅是一种冷战宣传手段而不予重视。”曾经长期侵略过中国西藏的老牌帝国主义英国，也由于保守党政府面临大选，有所不便，“泰晤士报”就曾提出“由英联邦国家提出一个联合倡议是适宜的”。这样，美国和英国就积极物色肯于出来充当马前卒的国家。可是，它们的活动并不顺利，没有多少人愿为他们效劳，到最近只好将就点由爱尔兰和马来亚这两个仆从来充当猫脚爪的角色。这是一点也不奇怪的。爱尔兰本来就是在联合国里充当过反苏反共急先锋的国家。1957年1月，爱尔兰进入联合国还不满两年，它的外长就接受美国红衣大主教史培尔曼的指令，带头在联合国大会上提出所谓“匈牙利问题”的提案。马来亚政府目前仍在英帝国主义的严密控制之下，实行着敌视中国的政策。
    所谓爱尔兰和马来亚的提案，完全是美、英帝国主义的货色，妄图用什么“西藏人的基本人权”、“公民自由和宗教自由”这类荒谬绝伦的借口来干涉中国的内政。但是，尽人皆知，联合国宪章明文规定：联合国根本无权干涉纯属各国内政的问题。美帝国主义积极策划联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”，是它企图把联合国继续作为干涉别国内政和执行“冷战”政策的可耻工具。如果听任联合国按照美国的阴谋进行下去，就必将造成威胁各国民族独立和阻碍国际局势缓和的严重后果。
    至于他们大吵大嚷要讨论西藏“自由”和“基本人权”，那真是无耻之极。全世界都清楚地看出，现在西藏人民正在推翻野蛮黑暗的农奴制度，正在获得做人的权利。美英帝国主义所要求的并不是什么基本人权，而是妄想把已经翻身的西藏人民重新投到黑暗的地狱中去。他们同情的是那些被推翻了的残酷无比的农奴主。美英帝国主义本身就是这样的农奴主。他们在世界各地实行民族压迫和种族歧视，并野蛮地摧残那里人民的基本人权。我们相信，一切自重的联合国会员国应该严格遵守联合国的宗旨和原则，不要堕入美国的“冷战”圈套，使自己在美国导演的这一出丑剧里扮演可耻的角色。任何国家如果为美帝国主义的“冷战”政策效劳，采取敌视六亿五千万中国人民的行动，结果只会搬起砖头打自己的脚。
    对于中国人民来说，联合国在美国的操纵下曾经有过敌视中国、侵略朝鲜的罪恶记录，早已威信扫地。在联合国里再一次诬蔑中国，根本损害不了中国人民的一根毫毛。没有任何力量能够阻挠西藏人民的大翻身和中国人民的建设社会主义的伟大事业的胜利前进。美帝国主义的反华煽动只能更加证明一条真理：美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界被压迫人民与爱好和平的人民的最凶恶的敌人。对于这样的敌人，必须坚决地、反复地进行针锋相对的斗争。
