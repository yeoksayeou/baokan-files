According to the *Liaoning Daily*, Xinbin County has fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes, seizing every opportunity to vigorously engage in a mass mountain product gathering campaign, achieving a bumper harvest of mountain products, expanding industrial raw materials and non-staple food sources for the country, and increasing the income of commune members. Statistics up to September 15th show that the county has already purchased 2 million catties of mountain pears, 288,000 catties of wild grapes, 13,000 catties of hazelnuts, 64,000 catties of hawthorns, as well as a total of 2.5 million catties of mountain walnuts, wild crabapples, small red dates, etc., increasing the income of communes and commune members by more than 80,000 yuan. The county's side-business income has increased three times compared to the same period last year.

Xinbin County is a purely mountainous area, with mountainous land accounting for 71% of the county's total area. Within the county, there are six major mountains: Laogang Mountain, Laotu Mountain, Caomao Ding, Shihuading, San Kuai Shi, and Hama Tang. Every autumn, grapes, mountain pears, hawthorns, hazelnuts, walnuts... are everywhere. The income from mountain products has always accounted for 30% to 40% of farmers' total income in the county.

This year, Xinbin County's mountain products are having an unprecedented bumper harvest. Incomplete statistics for just a few products, such as mountain pears, hawthorns, wild grapes, mountain walnuts, wild crabapples, hazelnuts, and small red dates, amount to more than 20 million catties. In order to increase the production of industrial raw materials and non-staple foods for the country and increase income for farmers, the Xinbin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided in mid-August to mobilize the people of the entire county to bring all mountain products down from the mountains, putting forward the slogan "Bumper Harvest, Not a Single One Lost." Each commune, based on its specific situation, seized every opportunity to organize short-term crash efforts. Yongling Commune, on the basis of basically completing fertilizer accumulation and strengthening late-stage field management, comprehensively arranged labor and transportation, and organized a mountain product harvesting campaign. More than 8,800 people and 482 large carts went up the mountains, personally led by Hong Tingzhu, Secretary of the County Party Committee and First Secretary of the Yongling Commune Party Committee. They adopted the methods of "operating in the deep mountains, camping on the spot, cooking on the spot, and processing (drying) on the spot," ensuring that "every ditch and gully, every mountain, is covered, not a single tree is missed, and not a single product is lost." In three days, they harvested 1,024,000 catties of mountain pears. After the first crash effort, after a few days of rest, they took advantage of the commune members' holiday on the Mid-Autumn Festival to conduct another small crash effort. Other communes also adopted a combination of short-term crash efforts and regular picking, both harvesting mountain products and not delaying the autumn harvest of large fields.

In the mountain product gathering movement, each commune implemented a payment method of more work, more pay, which greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of commune members. The Wanghutun Production Team of Xinbin Town Commune implemented the method of "the team stipulates tasks and records work points, and those who complete the tasks can keep the excess for themselves." Commune members went up the mountains early and returned late to pick fruit. Liu Guangli completed three days' worth of tasks in one day, and all the income from the remaining two days was his own, totaling 9.8 yuan. Shangjiahe Commune adopted the method of "commune members pick, the commune provides transportation, the team divides the income, and everyone is taken care of." The commune provided carts to transport the mountain products picked by commune members, with 80% of the income going to individuals and 20% going to the team, providing advances to commune members who could not go up the mountains (such as cooks, feeders, and tobacco roasters), ensuring that those who went up the mountains and those who did not were all happy.

The vigorous mountain product gathering movement has greatly increased the income of commune members. The 365 households of the Wanghutun Production Team earned an average of more than 30 yuan per household; the 16 households of the Donggou Production Team earned an average of 56 yuan per household. The commune members of the Guanjabaozi Production Team used to advance money from the commune every autumn to make cotton clothes. This year, they used the money from selling mountain products to make cotton clothes and also repaid more than 100 yuan in debts to the credit cooperative.

Xinbin County's mountain product harvesting work is continuing in depth. After it is all completed, the county will purchase more than 10 million catties of mountain products, which can increase the income of the people of the entire county by more than 400,000 yuan.

    见缝插针  大抓山货
    新宾县副业收入比去年同期增三倍
    据辽宁日报报道　新宾县充分发挥人民公社优越性，见缝插针，大搞群众性的山货采摘突击运动，做到了山货丰产丰收，为国家扩大工业原料和副食品货源，增加社员收入。到9月15日统计，全县已经收购山梨二百万斤、山葡萄二十八万八千斤、榛子一万三千斤、山里红六万四千斤，以及山核桃、山丁子、元枣等等共达二百五十万斤，公社和社员增加收入八万多元。全县副业收入比去年同期增加三倍。
    新宾县是纯山区，山地面积占全县总面积的71％。全县境内遍布着老岗山、老秃山、草帽顶、十花顶、三块石、蛤蚂塘等六座大山。每到秋季，葡萄、山梨、山里红、榛子、核桃……满山遍野。全县历来山货的收入都占农民总收入的30％到40％。
    今年，新宾县的山货是有史以来空前的大丰收，仅山梨、山里红、山葡萄、山核桃、山丁子、榛子、元枣等几项产品的不完全统计，就达两千万斤之多。为了给国家增产工业原料、副食品，为农民增加收入，中共新宾县委早在8月中旬就决定发动全县人民把山货全部拿下山来，提出了“丰产丰收，一粒不丢”的口号。各公社都根据具体情况见缝插针，组织短期突击。永陵公社在积肥基本结束和加强后期田间管理的基础上，全面安排了劳力、运力，组织了一次山货下山突击运动。八千八百多人、四百八十二台大车上山，由县委书记兼永陵公社党委第一书记洪廷柱同志亲自挂帅，采取了“深山作战、就地扎营、埋锅造饭、就地加工（晒干）”的办法，做到了“沟沟岔岔、山山不拉，一树不漏、一个不丢”。三天中抢收山梨一百零二万四千斤。第一次突击结束后，经过几天休整，在中秋节这天，趁社员放假，又搞了一次小突击。其他公社也都采取了短期突击和经常采摘相结合的办法，既采了山货，也不耽误大田秋收。
    在大搞山货采摘运动中，各公社都实行了多劳多得的计酬办法，大大激发了社员的生产积极性。新宾镇公社网户屯生产队实行“小队规定任务记工分，完成任务多采归自己”的办法，社员起早贪黑上山采果。刘广里一天就完成了三天的任务，下余两天的收入全部归自己，共收入九元八角钱。上夹河公社采取“社员自采、公社车拉，小队分成、照顾大家”的办法，社员采山货由社里出车拉，收入80％归个人，20％归小队，给不能上山的社员（如炊事员、饲养员、烤烟员等）预支，做到了上山的、不上山的皆大欢喜。
    大搞山货突击采摘运动，给社员增加了很大收入。网户屯生产队的三百六十五户，平均每户收入三十多元；东沟生产队十六户社员，平均每户收入五十六元。关家堡子生产队的社员每年到秋季都向社里预支钱做棉衣，今年用卖山货的钱做了棉衣，还偿还了信用社的一百多元欠款。
    新宾县山货下山工作正在深入开展，全部结束后，全县将收购山货一千多万斤，可为全县人民增加收入四十多万元。
