Long Live the Mass Movement

The National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade has opened. More than 6,500 representatives from all regions and ethnic groups of the country have brought generous gifts from the broad masses of workers on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts to the Party and the state, and they have brought the working class of the whole country's ambition to complete the national economic plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it this year and to greet the greater construction tasks of 1960. We warmly congratulate the convening of this conference, congratulate the advanced collectives and advanced producers who attended this conference and those who did not attend, congratulate the heroic and hardworking working class of our country, and congratulate them on the brilliant achievements they have created in the cause of socialist construction!

This conference is a conference to review the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward and to review the great power of the mass movement for socialist construction. The more than 6,500 representatives attending this conference represent nearly 200,000 advanced collectives and more than 2 million advanced producers. Together with tens of millions of workers across the country, they have established great achievements on all fronts of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade, in large enterprises with modern equipment, in the newly born "small foreign groups" enterprises, in industrial cities with rows of chimneys, and in factories and workshops of the emerging people's communes, which have made earth-shattering changes in our country in these short ten years, especially in the past year and this year. All of this, as a folk song in the Great Leap Forward said, is "endless to write on the blue sky as paper, and difficult to paint with the sea as a screen." This great mass movement led by our great Party is the source of strength for our country's eternal vitality and prosperity.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always taught us that history is created by the people. People are the most active factor in the productive forces; the history of human society is, in the final analysis, the history of production and the history of producers. The revolutionary mass movement is the locomotive of history, breaking through the shackles of social relations of production and driving society towards a new era. Every revolutionary movement in history has been a mass movement, and the depth and breadth of the revolution have also been determined by the depth and breadth of the mass movement. It is only because the proletariat has not stepped onto the stage of history that every revolutionary mass movement has been either sold out midway by landlords, nobles, and the bourgeoisie, or the fruits of the revolution have been usurped by landlords, nobles, and the bourgeoisie after the victory was won. Scientific socialism first pointed out that the revolutionary mass movement of the proletariat is the midwife of socialism, the inexhaustible force to smash the old capitalist world and build a new socialist world. The immortal lyrics of the "Internationale," "There has never been any savior, nor gods, nor emperors, nor heroes; we rely entirely on ourselves to save ourselves," inspire millions of proletarians to rise up and break free from the shackles of slavery, and also inspire their selfless labor to build their own new life. Contrary to the Marxist-Leninist view of the masses, bourgeois revolutionaries in ancient and modern times, no matter how ruthlessly they criticized the feudal system and how enthusiastically they praised "civil rights" and "democracy," did not believe in the power of the people; after the power of the people was revealed, they were all invariably afraid of the power of the people. The French bourgeois philosopher Rousseau said: "To make the majority govern and the minority be governed is contrary to the natural order. It is unimaginable for the people to gather together from time to time and devote themselves to public affairs." He believed that "the best and most natural way is for the smartest minority to manage the masses." This bourgeois view of the masses was once exposed by Marx in one sentence. Marx said: "When the masses are still conservative, the bourgeoisie cannot avoid being afraid of the stupidity of the masses, but when the masses become revolutionary, they are afraid of the awakening of the masses." What attitude to take towards the revolutionary mass movement is the watershed between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois revolutionaries.

Our Party has followed the Marxist-Leninist view of the masses, struggled hard for decades, and led the people's democratic revolutionary mass movement and the subsequent socialist revolutionary mass movement in a country with the largest population in the world, achieving victories of great historical significance. This victory liberated China's social productive forces and opened up a broad world for fully unleashing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people in building a new life. "The sea allows fish to leap, and the sky allows birds to fly." As Lenin said, socialist society "for the first time creates the possibility of truly widely and truly large-scale use of competition, attracting the real majority of workers to participate in the work, enabling them to show their talents in this work, exert their abilities, and display their talents." This is exactly the situation in our country today. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals are building the socialist mansion on the ruins of the old China, and the high tide of the socialist construction mass movement is surging across the country, wave after wave. It has nurtured thousands of heroes and heroines. The scale of this "gathering of heroes" is so grand, and the ranks of advanced producers across the country are so vast, reflecting the magnificent momentum of the socialist construction mass movement and how rapidly our social productive forces are advancing on a great voyage.

Just as in the people's democratic revolutionary mass movement, some right-leaning opportunists in our Party opposed the peasant movement, and just as in the socialist revolutionary mass movement, some right-leaning views in our Party disliked "cooperativization being too fast," in the socialist construction mass movement, there are also some right-leaning opportunists in our Party who say, "Revolution can engage in mass movements, but construction cannot engage in mass movements; agriculture can engage in mass movements, but industry cannot engage in mass movements." These people who oppose organizing mass movements in socialist construction and in industry reflect the bourgeois viewpoint. They do not believe in the power of the people, and they do not know that the liberation of the people can only be achieved through the struggle of the people themselves, and the happy life of the people can only be created by the hands of the people themselves. The socialist cause is an earth-shattering cause, and it is impossible for us to build a socialist society with a highly developed material production without the participation of the broad masses of people. In socialist construction, only by mobilizing the people most widely and giving full play to their enthusiasm and creativity can we achieve victory most quickly. Although industry and agriculture differ in the production process, they are both material production sectors that must rely on the labor of the people to carry out. The more conscious, active, and creative the people are in the labor process, the more, faster, better, and more economical the production will be, and the faster the socialist construction will develop. Right-leaning opportunists do not believe that the people who have shattered the old world can build a new world, so they are pessimistic, disappointed, and shaken, and ultimately fall into the quagmire of the bourgeoisie. The more than 6,500 advanced producers who participated in this conference and showed their talents in the socialist construction mass movement, and the great achievements created by the working class they represent in industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade, are a powerful counterattack against the erroneous views of these right-leaning opportunists.

Our socialist construction mass movement is carried out under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line. This is the fundamental reason why the socialist construction mass movement is infinitely powerful. A folk song says it well: "With the general line, we are gods, with boundless strength, holding up the blue sky with both hands." The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results reflects the strong desire of the 650 million people to rapidly change the poverty and backwardness of our country, and demonstrates our Party's high regard for the consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity of the people in the cause of building socialism.

It is precisely for this reason that the Party's general line has been warmly embraced by the broad masses of people once it was put forward, and it has been quickly grasped by the broad masses, forming a great force that no difficulty can stop. The Party's set of "walking on two legs" policies in economic work has mobilized the positive factors of all parties and opened up a stage for the 650 million heroic sons and daughters to display their talents. The experiences that the Party has summarized and promoted, such as "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," "big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and great debates," and "planting experimental fields," have greatly developed the working methods of the Party's mass line, further strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses, thereby making the potential forces of social productive forces burst out like nuclear fission. The convening of this "gathering of heroes" and the representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers who participated in this conference most vividly demonstrate that the general line and the principles, policies, and working methods embodying the spirit of the general line are completely correct. Those who attended this "gathering of heroes" are not only representatives from several aspects, but representatives from all aspects; not only representatives from many large enterprises, but also representatives from many small and medium-sized enterprises; they are the embodiment of the general line and the principles, policies, and working methods embodying the spirit of the general line. This "gathering of heroes" marks the great victory of the Party's general line and the great victory of the Party's mass line.

The socialist construction mass movement is infinitely powerful, and besides the Party's leadership being the fundamental reason, there are also many reasons. One of the most important is that our socialist construction mass movement is a mass movement that combines the revolutionary spirit of millions of people with technological innovation. The representatives who attended this "gathering of heroes" are all, without exception, both pioneers with soaring enthusiasm and experts in technological innovation. Their experience proves that only by combining revolutionary spirit with technological innovation, combining the spirit of hard work, the style of doing practical work, and the methods of ingenuity, can the socialist construction mass movement generate infinite power. Any production and construction must be carried out through technical equipment and technical operations. The energy of any person, no matter how hard they work, is always limited according to the laws of nature, while technological innovation is endless. Once people's revolutionary spirit is combined with technological innovation, and the hard work, bravery, intelligence, and talent of millions of people are combined, the power of the mass movement is endless. People with insufficient enthusiasm cannot talk about technological innovation; only people with soaring enthusiasm can climb to the peak of technological innovation. Thousands of advanced producers who are good at combining revolutionary spirit and technological innovation represent the direction of development of the socialist construction mass movement. Tens of millions of workers learn from their experience and move forward along their path, which will surely enable the socialist construction mass movement to continue to exert infinite power and enable the production level of the entire society to continue to leap forward to an advanced level.

Now, our country is in a vigorous high tide of the socialist construction mass movement. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great call to oppose right-leaning, boost morale, and practice increasing production and practicing economy, which has been warmly responded to by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, and production has been steadily rising. Judging from the current situation, the growth rate of industrial production in our country this year will greatly exceed the original plan, the steel output in our country this year will exceed 12 million tons, and the coal output in our country will exceed 335 million tons. The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule can certainly be realized. Now, the people of the whole country are fighting to complete this year's national economic plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule and to realize the continued Great Leap Forward next year. It can be believed that following this year's continued Great Leap Forward, next year will also be a situation of continued Great Leap Forward. We will not only take a Great Leap Forward step in building modern industry, but also stride forward in building modern agriculture. It can be fully affirmed that through next year's efforts, plus the efforts of the year after next and the year after that, by the end of 1962—the last year of the original Second Five-Year Plan—we will create incomparably magnificent miracles on the beautiful rivers and mountains of our great motherland. Our bold slogan of catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years will be realized ahead of schedule.

The tasks before us are great. We have all the conditions to complete this task. We already have a much stronger material foundation than ever before, and we also have richer experience than ever before. What is particularly important is that the general line of socialist construction has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the mass movement of the Great Leap Forward is developing vigorously with the force of overwhelming the mountains and overturning the seas. As long as we, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, adhere to the mass movement of socialist construction, rely on millions of advanced producers, unite all workers and the people of the whole country, and continue to hold high the red flag of the general line of socialist construction and forge ahead bravely, we will surely achieve greater victories. The National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade is of great significance at this time. We wish this conference success! We wish the continued Great Leap Forward mass movement success!

Long live the great mass movement!

    群众运动万岁
    全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会开幕了。来自全国各地区、各民族的六千五百多名代表，带来了工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸战线上广大职工献给党和国家的丰厚的礼品，带来了全国工人阶级提前超额完成今年的国民经济计划和迎接1960年更伟大的建设任务的雄心大志。我们热烈地祝贺这次大会的召开，祝贺出席这次大会的和没有出席这次大会的先进集体和先进生产者，祝贺我国英勇勤劳的工人阶级，祝贺他们在社会主义建设事业中所创造的光辉成就！
    这次大会，是一次检阅大跃进伟大成就的大会，是一次检阅社会主义建设群众运动的伟大力量的大会。出席这次大会的六千五百多名代表，代表着将近二十万个先进集体和二百多万个先进生产者。他们同全国几千万职工一起，在工业、交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易的各个战线上，在拥有现代化设备的大企业里、在诞生不久的“小洋群”企业里，在烟囱林立的工业城市里、在新兴的人民公社的工厂和作坊里，创立了伟大的功勋，使我们的国家在这短短十年里，特别是在去年和今年，发生了惊天动地的变化。这一切，正如一首大跃进中的民歌所说，是“蓝天作纸写不完，沧海为屏画难尽”。我们伟大的党所领导的这个伟大的群众运动，就是我们的国家永远生机蓬勃、欣欣向荣的力量的源泉。
    党中央和毛泽东同志一向教导我们，历史是人民群众创造的。人是生产力中最积极的因素；人类社会的历史，归根到底是生产的历史，是生产者的历史。革命的群众运动则是历史的火车头，它冲破社会生产关系的种种桎梏，推动着社会奔向新的时代。历史上的每一次革命运动都是群众运动，革命的深度和广度也都决定于群众运动的深度和广度。只不过在无产阶级登上历史舞台以前，每一次革命的群众运动都不免或则受到地主、贵族、资产阶级中途出卖；或则在取得胜利以后被地主、贵族、资产阶级篡夺了革命的果实。科学的社会主义第一次指出，革命的无产阶级的群众运动，是社会主义的产婆，是粉碎资本主义旧世界和建设社会主义新世界的无穷无尽的力量。“国际歌”上“从来就没有什么救世主，也不是神仙和皇帝，更不是那些英雄和豪杰；全靠自己救自己”的不朽的歌辞，鼓舞着千千万万无产者起来挣脱奴隶的枷锁，也鼓舞着他们的忘我的劳动，建设自己的新生活。同马克思列宁主义的群众观相反，古今中外的资产阶级革命家，不管他们曾经多么无情地抨击过封建制度，多么热烈地歌颂过“民权”、“民治”，但是他们都不相信人民群众的力量；当人民群众的力量显示出来以后，都毫不例外地害怕人民群众的力量。法国的资产阶级哲学家卢梭说：“使大多数人管治，少数人被管治，这是反乎自然的秩序的。要人民不时聚在一起专心致志于公共事务，这是不能想像的”。他认为“最好的和最自然的办法，是以最聪明的少数人来管理大众”。资产阶级这种群众观，曾经被马克思一语道破。马克思说：“资产阶级当民众还是保守的时候，是不免要害怕民众愚钝的，而在民众一旦变得革命的时候，却又要害怕民众觉悟了”。对革命的群众运动采取什么态度，是无产阶级革命家和资产阶级革命家的分水岭。
    我们党遵循马克思列宁主义的群众观，艰苦奋斗数十年，在一个世界上人口最多的国家中，领导人民民主革命的群众运动和相继而起的社会主义革命的群众运动，取得了具有伟大历史意义的胜利。这个胜利解放了中国的社会生产力，为充分发挥广大人民群众建设新生活的积极性和创造性开辟了广阔的天地。“大海从鱼跃，长空凭鸟飞”。正如列宁所说的，社会主义社会“破天荒第一次造成真正广泛地、真正大规模地运用竞赛的可能，吸引真正大多数劳动者参加工作，使他们能够在这种工作中大显身手，施展自己的本领，发挥自己的天才”。目前我国的情况正是这样。广大的工人、农民和革命知识分子在旧中国的废墟上建设着社会主义的大厦，社会主义建设群众运动的高潮在全国汹涌澎湃，一浪高过一浪。它孕育出千千万万的英雄儿女。这次“群英会”的规模如此盛大，全国先进生产者的队伍又是这样的浩浩荡荡，反映出社会主义建设群众运动的壮阔的声势和我国的社会生产力正在一个多么伟大的航程上高速前进。
    正如在人民民主革命的群众运动中，我们党内有过一些右倾机会主义分子反对农民运动一样，也正如在社会主义革命的群众运动中，我们党内又有过一些嫌“合作化太快”的右倾观点一样，在社会主义建设的群众运动中，我们党内也有一些右倾机会主义分子，他们说“革命可以搞群众运动，建设不能搞群众运动；农业可以搞群众运动，工业不能搞群众运动”。这些反对在社会主义建设中、在工业中组织群众运动的人，同样是反映了资产阶级的观点。他们不相信人民群众的力量，不知道人民群众的解放只有经过人民群众自己的斗争才能成功，人民群众的幸福生活也只有由人民群众自己的双手才能创造出来。社会主义事业是翻天覆地的事业，我们要建设一个物质生产高度发展的社会主义社会，没有广大人民群众的参加是不可能的。在社会主义建设中，只有最广泛地动员人民群众，只有最充分地发挥他们的积极性和创造性，才能最迅速地取得胜利。工业和农业尽管在生产过程上有所不同，但是都是必须依靠人民群众的劳动才能进行的物质生产部门。人民群众在劳动过程中越自觉、越积极、越富于创造性，生产就越多越快越好越省，社会主义建设就越能高速度地向前发展。右倾机会主义分子不相信已经粉碎了旧世界的人民群众一定能建设起新的世界来，因而悲观、失望、动摇，终至陷入资产阶级的泥坑中去。参加这次大会的在社会主义建设群众运动中大显身手的六千五百多位先进生产者，和他们所代表的我国工人阶级在工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸方面所创造的丰功伟绩，就是对这些右倾机会主义分子的错误观点的有力的回击。
    我们的社会主义建设的群众运动，是在党的领导下、在党的总路线的光辉照耀下进行的。这是社会主义建设群众运动的威力无穷无尽的根本原因。一首民歌说得好：“有了总路线，我们当神仙，力大没有边，双手托青天”。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，反映了六亿五千万人民要求迅速改变我国贫穷和落后面貌的强烈愿望，表现了我们党对于人民群众在建设社会主义事业中的觉悟性、积极性、创造性的高度的重视。
    正因为这个缘故，党的总路线一经提出，就受到了广大人民群众的热烈拥护，并且迅速被广大群众所掌握，形成了任何困难也不能阻挡的伟大的力量。党在经济工作中一套“两条腿走路”的方针，调动了各方面的积极因素，为六亿五千万英雄儿女开辟了用武之地。党所总结和推行的“两参一改三结合”、“大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论”、“种试验田”等等经验，大大发展了党的群众路线的工作方法，更加密切了党和群众的联系，从而使社会生产力的潜在力量像原子核分裂一样迸发出来。这次群英会的召开和参加这次大会的先进集体和先进生产者的代表，最生动地证明了总路线和体现总路线精神的方针、政策、工作方法是完全正确的。出席这次“群英会”的，不只有几个方面的代表，而是有各个方面的代表；不只有许许多多大型企业的代表，而且有许许多多中小企业的代表；他们是总路线和体现总路线精神的方针、政策、工作方法的化身。这次群英会，标志着党的总路线的伟大胜利，党的群众路线的伟大胜利。
    社会主义建设群众运动之所以具有无穷无尽的威力，除了党的领导是根本原因之外，也还有许多原因。其中很重要的一条，就是我们的社会主义建设群众运动，是千百万人的革命干劲和技术革新相结合的群众运动。出席这次“群英会”的代表，都毫无例外地既是干劲冲天的闯将，又是技术革新的能手。他们的经验证明，只有把革命干劲和技术革新结合起来，把苦干的精神、实干的作风和巧干的办法结合起来，才能使社会主义建设的群众运动产生无穷无尽的威力。任何一项生产建设，总是要通过技术设备和技术操作去进行的。任何人的精力，无论他如何废寝忘餐，按照自然的规律，总是有限度的，而技术革新则是无穷无尽的。一旦人们的革命干劲和技术革新结合起来，千百万人的勤劳勇敢和聪明才智结合起来，群众运动的威力就是无穷无尽了。干劲不足的人是谈不上技术革新的；只有干劲冲天的人才能攀上技术革新的高峰。千千万万善于把革命干劲和技术革新结合起来的先进生产者，代表着社会主义建设群众运动的发展方向。几千万职工学习他们的经验，沿着他们的道路前进，就一定能使社会主义建设群众运动继续发挥无穷无尽的威力，使整个社会的生产水平继续不断地向先进的水平跃进。
    现在，我国正处在蓬勃发展的社会主义建设群众运动的高潮中，党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的伟大号召，得到了广大工人、农民、革命知识分子的热烈响应，生产一直稳步上升。从目前的形势看来，今年我国工业生产的增长速度将大大超过原定计划，今年我国的钢产量将超过一千二百万吨，我国的煤产量将超过三亿三千五百万吨。党的八届八中全会提出的提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召一定可以实现。现在，全国人民正为提前十天到十五天完成今年的国民经济计划和为实现明年的继续大跃进而奋斗。可以相信，紧接着今年的继续大跃进，明年也将是一个继续大跃进的形势，我们不只是要在建设现代化工业方面迈开大跃进的步伐，而且要在建设现代化农业方面也要阔步向前。完全可以肯定，经过明年的努力，再加上后年、大后年的努力，到1962年底——就是原定的第二个五年计划的最后一年，我们将在我们伟大祖国的锦绣河山上创造出无比壮丽的奇迹。我们在十年左右在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的豪迈的口号，定将提早实现。
    摆在我们面前的任务是伟大的。我们有一切条件完成这个任务。我们已经有了比过去任何时候都要强大得多的物质基础，也已经有了比过去任何时候都要丰富的经验。特别重要的是，社会主义的建设总路线已深入人心，大跃进的群众运动正以排山倒海之势蓬勃发展。只要我们在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，坚持社会主义建设的群众运动，依靠几百万先进生产者，团结全体职工和全国人民，继续高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗奋勇前进，我们一定能取得更大的胜利。全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会在这个时候召开，是有重大意义的。我们预祝这次大会成功！预祝继续大跃进的群众运动成功！
    伟大的群众运动万岁！
