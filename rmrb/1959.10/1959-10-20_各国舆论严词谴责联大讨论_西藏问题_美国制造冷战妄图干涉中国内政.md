Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today stating: The so-called "Tibet issue" raised at the United Nations on October 7th, although bearing the trademark of Ireland-Malaya, is a product manufactured in Washington.

The commentary pointed out: "At a time when the international situation is tending towards relaxation, the US imperialists' raising of the so-called 'Tibet issue' is clearly to continue creating a Cold War and poison the international atmosphere." The commentary stated: "Under pressure from the people of all countries, certain figures in the United States have recently been talking about 'peace,' but their words and deeds are inconsistent. Those who stubbornly adhere to the outdated policy of strength are trying every possible means to divert public opinion from issues closely related to maintaining world peace. The so-called 'Tibet issue' is merely an ugly drama used to cover up the activities of the United States in interfering and creating tension in Asia and elsewhere."

The commentary stated: "One of the malicious intentions of the United States in raising the so-called 'Tibet issue' is to attempt to weaken the rising prestige of the peace-loving People's Republic of China and to sow discord among Asian and African countries." The commentary stated that the United States is fabricating the "Tibet issue" to carry out a "Cold War" against China, but China will not suffer any harm from this. On the contrary, the imperialists will have to bear the consequences of their dark dealings.

The commentary concluded: "The Vietnamese people, together with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, resolutely oppose the raising and discussion of the so-called 'Tibet issue.' The matter of Tibet is China's internal affair, and the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere, nor does any country have the right to intervene."

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 17th - The Bulgarian newspapers "Workers' Cause," "Labor," "People's Army," and "Rural Cooperative" today, in their weekly international reviews, sternly condemned the United Nations General Assembly for, under US manipulation, adopting the inclusion of the so-called "Tibet issue" on the UNGA agenda.

"Workers' Cause" said that this is an open provocation against the Chinese people and the peace-loving forces of the world, "a rude and blatant interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China," and "a violation of the United Nations Charter." The newspaper said that the aim of the imperialist elements is to slander the great Chinese people and the government of the Chinese people, to obstruct and delay the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, to obstruct the improvement of relations between Southeast Asian countries, to undermine cooperation between China and Asian countries, and to hinder the struggle of Asian countries for the maintenance of their national independence.

"Labor" said that the inclusion of the so-called "Tibet issue" on the UNGA agenda under the manipulation of the United Nations General Assembly is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and is completely contrary to the United Nations Charter. The newspaper pointed out that Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times.

"People's Army" said that the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair and does not allow foreign interference. The newspaper said that these activities of interfering in China's internal affairs are all manipulated by the United States, whose despicable purpose is to slander and attack China, obstruct China from obtaining full international recognition, and poison the international atmosphere.

"Rural Cooperative" said that the inclusion of the so-called "Tibet issue" on the UNGA agenda is a shameless provocation and interference in China's internal affairs by certain individuals nested in Washington, which is not conducive to the relaxation of international relations, nor to peace and international cooperation, but only serves the aggressive interests of a small group of imperialist elements.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 19th - The Polish "Voice of Labor" published a commentary today condemning the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue."

The commentary pointed out that the events that occurred in Tibet this spring are entirely the internal affairs of People's China. Any attempt by an international organization to interfere is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations.

The commentary said that although the representatives of Ireland and Malaya raised the so-called "Tibet issue" at the United Nations, they were being used. The purpose of these provocative clamors issued at the United Nations General Assembly is to intensify the international situation. The Cold War elements feel that the policy of not recognizing People's China and obstructing the restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations is becoming increasingly unpopular, so they want to strengthen their position and obtain new "arguments" against China. However, this provocation is doomed to failure.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th - The "Dawn Daily" published an editorial today on the Indonesian representative's opposition to the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue," saying that the Tibet issue is an internal affair of China and should not be brought up for discussion in the United Nations.

The editorial pointed out that the United States and its accomplices are using the "Tibet issue" as a tool of the "Cold War." Therefore, the Indonesian representative attending the United Nations was absolutely correct in voting against including the "Tibet issue" on the UNGA agenda.

The editorial pointed out that if the United Nations discusses the internal affairs of a country as a common practice, it will cause much confusion in Asian and African countries. It pointed out that to date, there are still many internal disputes in Asian and African countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 17th - The Cambodian newspaper "Observer" said today that the Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and therefore it is regrettable that the United Nations has violated its charter by deciding to discuss this issue.

The newspaper also said, "It can be asserted that at a time when international relations are just beginning to ease, this decision, which favors those who advocate the Cold War, will hinder the already difficult process of moving towards a comprehensive clarification of the international atmosphere."

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 18th - The Lebanese "Voice Newspaper" published an article today criticizing the United Nations General Assembly for including the so-called "Tibetan Incident" on the agenda of the General Assembly under the manipulation of the United States and its lackeys. The newspaper said, "This brazen resolution has aroused indignation among many people in political and other circles around the world."

The article gave a detailed account of the history and current situation of the Tibet region of China, emphasizing that Tibet is an inseparable part of China. The article also said that discussing China's "Tibetan Incident" anywhere "can only be regarded as a gross interference in China's internal affairs."

The newspaper said that the US imperialist bloc's creation of trouble "aims to harm and discredit the prestige of People's China, to insist that this great peaceful country is aggressive, as an excuse to refuse to restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and to maintain international tension, especially tension in Asia."

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th - Daniel Latifi, a member of the Executive Bureau of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and a lawyer of the Supreme Court of India, told Xinhua News Agency here today that the United Nations debate on the so-called "Tibet issue" "is a violation of the United Nations Charter and an illegal interference in China's internal affairs."

He said that it is strange that the United Nations has not had the time to discuss the representation of the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 600 million, in the past few years, but has had time to conduct a useless and illegal debate on the "Tibet issue."

He pointed out that the United Nations debate on the "Tibet issue" is the most irresponsible action.

Latifi arrived here in Hong Kong yesterday from Guangzhou after attending the celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and he will leave Hong Kong for Mumbai today.

　　各国舆论严词谴责联大讨论“西藏问题”
    美国制造冷战妄图干涉中国内政
    新华社河内17日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论说：10月7日在联合国提出的所谓“西藏问题”，虽然贴着爱尔兰—马来亚的商标，但却是华盛顿制造的货色。
    评论指出：“当国际局势正趋向缓和的时候，美帝国主义提出所谓‘西藏问题’，显然是为了继续制造冷战，毒化国际气氛。”评论说：“在各国人民的压力下，美国某些人物最近也在谈论‘和平’，可是他们的言行并不一致。那些顽固地奉行过时的实力政策的人正在千方百计地妄图转移舆论对同维护世界和平有密切关系的问题的注意。所谓‘西藏问题’正是用来掩盖美国在亚洲和其它地方的国家进行干涉和制造紧张局势的活动的一幕丑剧。”
    评论说：“美国提出所谓‘西藏问题’的恶毒的用意之一，是妄图削弱爱好和平的中华人民共和国的日益高涨的威信，并企图离间亚非各国。”评论说，美国捏造“西藏问题”以进行反对中国的“冷战”，可是中国并不因此受到丝毫的损害。相反，帝国主义者将要对它们的黑暗勾当所造成的后果负起责任。
    评论最后说：“越南人民同亚非各国人民和全世界人民一起，坚决反对提出和讨论所谓‘西藏问题’。西藏的事情是中国的内政，联合国完全无权过问，任何国家也无权加以干涉。”
    新华社索非亚17日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”、“劳动报”、“人民军报”和“农村合作报”今天在每周国际评论里，严正谴责联合国大会在美国操纵下，通过把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程。
    “工人事业报”说，这是对中国人民及全世界和平力量的公开挑衅，“是对中华人民共和国内政的无礼和粗暴的干涉”，“破坏了联合国宪章”。报纸说，帝国主义分子的企图是：污蔑伟大的中国人民和中国人民的政府，阻挠和拖延恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位，阻挠东南亚各国间关系的改善，破坏中国和亚洲各国间的合作，阻挠亚洲各国人民为维护本国民族独立而进行的斗争。
    “劳动报”说，联合国大会在美国操纵下把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程，这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，并且同联合国宪章完全对立。报纸指出，西藏自古以来就是中国的不可分割的一部分。
    “人民军报”说，西藏叛乱问题是中国的内政，绝不容许外来干涉。这家报纸说，这些干涉中国内政的活动都是美国操纵的，其卑鄙目的是：诬蔑和攻击中国，阻挠中国得到国际的完全承认，毒化国际气氛。
    “农村合作报”说，把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程，是以华盛顿为巢穴的某些人士，对中国内政的无耻挑衅和干涉，这既不利于国际关系的缓和，也不利于和平和国际合作，而只符合一小撮帝国主义分子的侵略利益。
    新华社华沙19日电　波兰“劳动之声报”今天发表评论，谴责联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”。
    评论指出，今年春天在西藏发生的事件完全是人民中国的内政。任何国际组织企图加以干涉都是同联合国的宪章相违背的。
    评论说，在联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”的虽然是爱尔兰和马来亚的代表，但他们是被利用的。在联合国大会发出的这些挑衅性的叫嚣的目的在于使国际局势紧张化。冷战分子感到不承认人民中国和阻挠恢复它在联合国的合法席位的政策日益不得人心，所以他们想以此来加强自己的地位，并获得新的反对中国的“论证”。但是，这种挑衅是注定要失败的。
    新华社雅加达16日电　“黎明日报”今天就印度尼西亚代表反对联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”一事发表社论说，西藏问题是中国的内政问题，不应当在联合国内提出来讨论。
    社论指出，美国和它的同谋者利用“西藏问题”作为“冷战”的工具。因此，印度尼西亚出席联合国的代表投票反对把“西藏问题”列入联大议程，是非常正确的。
    社论指出，如果联合国讨论一个国家的内政问题成为一种通常的做法，那么就会在亚非国家中引起许多混乱。它指出，到目前为止，亚非国家中仍然有许多内部纠纷问题。
    新华社金边17日电　柬埔寨报纸“观察家报”今天说，西藏问题是中国的内政，因此联合国违背宪章决定讨论这个问题，是令人感到遗憾的。
    报纸又说，“可以断言，正当国际间刚刚开始缓和的时候，这个有利于主张冷战的人们的决定，势将阻碍已经十分困难的、走向全面澄清国际气氛的进程”。
    新华社贝鲁特18日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表文章，斥责联合国大会在美国及其仆从的操纵下把所谓“西藏事件”列入大会议程。这家报纸说，“这个放肆的决议引起了世界各地政界和其他各界许多人士的愤慨”。
    文章详细介绍了中国西藏地方的历史和目前的情况，强调指出西藏是中国的不可分割的一部分。文章还说，在任何地方讨论中国的“西藏事件”，“只能被认为是对中国的内政的粗暴干涉”。
    报纸说，美帝国主义集团这样兴风作浪，“目的在于损害和诋毁人民中国的威望，硬说这个伟大的和平国家具有侵略性，以此作为借口来拒不恢复中国在联合国的合法席位，来保持国际紧张局势，特别是在亚洲的紧张局势”。
    新华社香港18日电　国际民主法律工作者协会执行局委员、印度最高法院律师丹尼尔·拉蒂菲今天在这里对新华社记者说，联合国关于所谓“西藏问题”的辩论“是违反联合国宪章的，并且是对中国内政的非法干涉”。
    他说，联合国在过去几年没有功夫讨论拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国的代表权问题，而竟有时间对“西藏问题”进行无益而非法的辩论，那是很奇怪的。
    他指出，联合国辩论“西藏问题”是最不负责任的行动。
    拉蒂菲在北京参加了中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝典礼后昨天从广州到达这里，他将在今天离开香港去孟买。
