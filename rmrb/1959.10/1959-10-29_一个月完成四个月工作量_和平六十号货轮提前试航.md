Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th: The Peace No. 60, a 3,000-ton diesel coastal freighter built by the Hudong Shipyard, set out for sea trials ahead of schedule on the 26th, offering a gift to the National Congress of Heroes. The workers of this factory once created an astonishing record of a 19-day construction cycle on the slipway; now, they have completed the outfitting and dockside testing work originally planned to take three or four months in just thirty actual working days.

After this freighter was launched on September 17, the workers of the engine workshop of this factory, an advanced collective selected to attend the National Congress of Heroes, improved the single-cylinder installation process in the main engine installation, adopted a new process of combined parallel installation, and completed the main engine disassembly and assembly project, originally estimated to take 25 days, in just 8 days.

    一个月完成四个月工作量
    和平六十号货轮提前试航
    新华社上海28日电　沪东造船厂建造的和平六十号三千吨柴油机沿海货轮，26日已提前出海试航，向全国群英会献礼。这个厂的职工曾创造船台周期19天的惊人纪录；现在，又用三十个实际工作日完成了原计划要三、四个月完成的舣装和码头试车工作。
    这艘货轮在9月17日下水以后，被选为出席全国群英会的先进集体——这个厂的轮机车间的工人，在主机安装中改进了单缸安装工艺，采取了联合平行安装的新工艺，8天就完成了原来估计25天还难完成的主机拆装工程。
