Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: The National Movement Implementation Committee for Realizing the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations and Celebrating the National Day of the People's Republic of China, composed of more than seventy mass organizations and political parties, issued a statement on the 28th opposing the illegal adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue."

The statement pointed out that the purpose of this resolution is to deliberately distort the reality of Tibet, slander and attack China in violation of the United Nations Charter, and interfere in China's internal affairs. The reason this resolution was passed in the General Assembly is the result of pressure exerted on the General Assembly by cold war supporters in the United States who fear the easing of the cold war atmosphere.

The statement strongly condemned the Japanese government representative for voting in favor of this resolution at the General Assembly. The statement pointed out that this attitude is a concrete manifestation of following the United States, taking on the task of intensifying tensions in Asia for the United States, and pursuing a policy of hostility towards China.

The statement pointed out that this attitude is utterly incompatible with the will of the Japanese people who sincerely desire peace, independence, and neutrality. The statement expressed strong anger and protest against this attitude of the Nobusuke Kishi government.

    反对联大通过诽谤中国的非法决议
    指责岸政府在联大追随美国敌视中国
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：由七十多个群众团体和政党组成的实现恢复日中邦交和庆祝中华人民共和国国庆国民运动实行委员会28日发表声明，反对联合国大会非法通过关于所谓“西藏问题”的决议。
    声明指出，这项决议的目的在于故意歪曲西藏的现实情况，违反联合国宪章对中国进行诬蔑和攻击并且干涉中国内政。这项决议所以在联大通过，是害怕冷战气氛缓和的美国冷战支持者对联大施加压力的结果。
    声明强烈指责日本政府代表在联大投票赞成这个决议。声明指出，这种态度是追随美国、替美国在亚洲担负起加剧紧张局势的任务、敌视中国政策的具体表现。
    声明指出，这种态度是同衷心渴望和平、独立、中立的日本人民的意志水火不相容的。声明对岸信介政府这种态度表示强烈的愤怒和抗议。
