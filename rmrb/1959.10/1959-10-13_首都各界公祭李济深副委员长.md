At the beginning of the public memorial ceremony, the band played funeral music, and the presiding officer, Chairman Zhu De, presented a wreath to the memorial tablet of Mr. Li Jishen.

Then, Lin Boqu, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, delivered a eulogy, and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, introduced the life and deeds of Vice Chairman Li Jishen.

In his eulogy, Lin Boqu said that Mr. Li Jishen was a patriotic democratic revolutionist. In his early years, he participated in the struggle led by Sun Yat-sen against imperialism and the Northern Warlords. After the "September 18th" Incident occurred, and the national crisis became increasingly serious, he opposed Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and actively engaged in anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang activities.

Lin Boqu said that during the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Li Jishen responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party to persist in resistance, persist in unity, and persist in progress, opposed Chiang Kai-shek's policy of passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism, and played a positive role in contacting the patriotic democratic forces within the Kuomintang and supporting the anti-Japanese democratic movement, and from then on began to cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party.

Lin Boqu said that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, under the influence and help of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Li Jishen continued to devote himself to promoting domestic peace and democracy, played an important role in uniting the patriotic and democratic elements within the Kuomintang. After Chiang Kai-shek tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and launched a full-scale anti-communist and anti-people civil war, he forcefully exposed and severely condemned Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of betraying the country and dictatorship, united the democratic factions of the Kuomintang, responded to the Chinese Communist Party's "May 1st" call, and became an active participant and supporter of the people's democratic united front led by the Party.

Lin Boqu said that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Li Jishen participated in the Chinese people's democratic regime, supported the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with a firm and clear attitude, actively participated in the struggle against American imperialism and for the liberation of Taiwan. Over the past decade, he has contributed his own strength to various political activities in our country.

Lin Boqu finally said that Mr. Li Jishen had been cooperating with the Communist Party for more than twenty years since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. Although he once stood on the side of the enemies of the people when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, the driving force of the revolutionary situation and his own patriotism finally led him to gradually accept the leadership of the Communist Party and embark on the road of the new democratic revolution. In the ten years since the founding of the country, Mr. Li Jishen, in his political life, followed the direction pointed out by the Party and advanced towards socialism. Especially during the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, he saw the brilliant achievements of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and with joy and excitement, actively participated in the celebration activities, enthusiastically praising the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Mr. Li Jishen, as our ancient saying goes, "his later years were admirable," which is worthy of praise.

Cheng Qian reported on the life and deeds of Vice Chairman Li Jishen. He said that Vice Chairman Li Jishen had experienced different eras of the late Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlord government, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and People's China, and participated in different types of struggles of the old democratic revolution, the new democratic revolution, and the socialist revolution. He had gone through many tortuous roads, and with the development of the revolutionary situation, under the unity and education of the Chinese Communist Party, he gradually moved forward to the progressive side, became a patriotic democratic revolutionist, and accepted the path of socialism, writing a glorious page in the history of his later years.

At 10:30 a.m., after the public memorial ceremony, the coffin was moved amidst the sound of funeral music, and at 11:30 a.m., an enshrinement ceremony was held at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.

    公祭开始时，乐队奏起哀乐，主祭人朱德委员长向李济深先生灵位献花圈。
    接着，由全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林伯渠致悼词，中国国民党革命委员会副主席程潜介绍李济深副委员长生平事迹。
    林伯渠致悼词说，李济深先生是一个爱国的民主革命者。他早年参加了孙中山领导的反对帝国主义和北洋军阀的斗争。“九一八”事变发生，民族危机日益严重，他反对蒋介石的卖国独裁，积极从事抗日反蒋的活动。
    林伯渠说，在抗日战争时期，李济深先生响应了中国共产党坚持抗战、坚持团结、坚持进步的号召，反对蒋介石消极抗日、积极反共的卖国投降政策，在联络国民党内部的爱国民主力量和支持抗日民主运动方面　起了积极的作用，并从此开始和中国共产党合作。
    林伯渠说，在抗日战争胜利结束以后，李济深先生在中国共产党的影响和帮助之下，继续致力于促进国内的和平民主，对团结国民党内爱国民主分子起了重要的作用。当蒋介石撕毁政协决议，发动全面的反共反人民的内战以后，他有力地揭露了和严厉谴责了蒋介石卖国独裁的罪行，联合国民党的民主派，响应了中国共产党的“五一”号召，成为党所领导的人民民主统一战线的积极参加者和支持者。
    林伯渠说，中华人民共和国成立以后，李济深先生参加了中国人民民主政权，拥护共产党和毛主席的领导，以坚定明确的态度，积极参加了反对美帝国主义和解放台湾的斗争。十年来，在我们国家的各项政治活动中，贡献了他自己的力量。
    林伯渠最后说，李济深先生从抗日战争开始，和共产党合作已经有二十多年了。虽然他在蒋介石1927年背叛革命的时候，曾经一度站在同人民敌对的地位，但是由于革命形势的推动和他自己的爱国主义思想，终于使他逐步接受了共产党的领导，走上了新民主主义革命的道路。建国十年来，李济深先生在他的政治生活中，跟着党所指引的方向，朝着社会主义前进，特别是在伟大的建国十周年国庆纪念的时候，他看到总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉成就，怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情，积极参加庆祝活动，热情地歌颂了党和毛主席的英明领导。李济深先生正如我们古语所说的“晚节可风”，是值得称赞的。
    程潜报告了李济深副委员长的生平事迹。他说，李济深副委员长经历了晚清、北洋政府、国民党反动统治和人民中国的不同时代，参加了旧民主主义革命、新民主主义革命和社会主义革命不同性质的斗争，走过了不少迂回曲折的道路，随着革命形势的发展，在中国共产党的团结和教育下，他逐步向进步的一方面前进，成为一个爱国主义的民主革命者，并且接受了社会主义的道路，在自己晚年的历史上写下了光荣的一页。
    十时半，公祭大会结束后，在哀乐声中起灵，十一时半，在八宝山烈士公墓举行了安灵仪式。
