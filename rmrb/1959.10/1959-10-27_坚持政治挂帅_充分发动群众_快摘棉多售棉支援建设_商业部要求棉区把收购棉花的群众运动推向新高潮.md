    Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 26th. The Ministry of Commerce recently held a national cotton purchase work experience exchange meeting in Handan, Hebei, requiring all cadres engaged in cotton purchase and commune members in cotton-producing areas to rely on the leadership of the Party, continue to oppose rightism and boost morale, seize the current decisive season of cotton harvest, push the mass movement of cotton purchase to a new upsurge, complete it in one go without leaving any loose ends, and overfulfill this year's cotton purchase task ahead of schedule.

    The meeting pointed out that the current situation of cotton purchase nationwide is very good. As of October 14, the national cotton purchase volume increased by 58% compared with the same period last year, and the quality of cotton has also greatly improved compared with last year. At present, a greater upsurge in cotton purchase, centered on quick picking of cotton and selling more cotton, has rapidly formed throughout the country.

    At the meeting, representatives from various regions focused on exchanging experiences in carrying out mass movements in cotton purchase work. The experiences of various regions show that relying on the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, focusing on ideology in every link, and mobilizing the masses at every level are the basic guarantees for carrying out mass movements in cotton purchase. In September, the Party Committee Secretaries of various counties in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, personally took charge, combined with the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and used the methods of full airing of views, great debate, and big-character posters to launch a struggle against right-leaning and fear of difficulties. The communes universally educated farmers on the worker-peasant alliance and the general line, repeatedly explaining that early and frequent picking and improving cotton grades are beneficial to the country and to themselves, thereby raising the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers for picking and selling cotton to support national construction. More than two million male and female commune members in the entire prefecture were put into the cotton picking and selling movement, and by October 15, they had overfulfilled the original cotton purchase task for this year six months ahead of last year, and at the same time completed the wheat field sowing plan. This fact made the representatives clearly realize that relying on the leadership of the Party and carrying out mass movements in a big way is an invincible magic weapon; strengthening specific leadership and carrying out meticulous and down-to-earth organizational work, rationally allocating labor and transportation forces, are important links in carrying out mass cotton purchase movements.

    The meeting called on all regions to promote the experience of unified leadership in Handan Prefecture, Hebei, and Linqing, Shandong. Their specific practices are: from the county, commune, management area all the way to the production team, establish joint cotton purchase headquarters, led by the Party Committee Secretary, to uniformly plan and allocate manpower. Each production team organizes special teams for cotton picking, cotton transportation, autumn plowing, and wheat sowing, according to the cotton output and the size of the three-autumn production tasks.

    The speed and quality of cotton picking directly affect the progress of purchase work and cotton quality. Therefore, the meeting required all regions to pay special attention to cotton picking work, ensuring that there is no ripe cotton in the fields, no cotton entering the team, and no cotton stored in the team, and that the cotton is sent directly from the fields to the processing plants and purchase stations. In terms of purchase, all regions should appropriately increase the number of purchase stations, send people to production teams for acceptance, carry out mobile purchases, and set up points for storage, so as to ensure that cotton is purchased as soon as it arrives, without leaving a single bale.

    The representatives of the one hundred and ninety-seven key counties participating in the meeting also proposed a proposal to cotton-producing counties nationwide, guaranteeing to overfulfill the cotton purchase task ahead of schedule and without leaving any loose ends.

    坚持政治挂帅  充分发动群众
    快摘棉多售棉支援建设
    商业部要求棉区把收购棉花的群众运动推向新高潮
    据新华社邯郸26日电　商业部最近在河北邯郸召开全国棉花收购工作经验交流会议，要求各地担任棉花收购工作的职工和棉产区各公社的社员，依靠党的领导，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，抓紧在当前棉花收获的决定性季节，把棉花收购的群众运动推向新的高潮，一气呵成，不留尾巴，提前超额完成今年的棉花收购任务。
    会议指出，当前全国棉花收购的形势很好。截止10月14日，全国的棉花收购量比去年同期增加了58％，棉花的质量也比去年大大提高。目前，一个以快摘棉、多售棉为中心的棉花收购更大高潮，已在全国各地迅速形成。
    在会议上，各地代表着重交流了棉花收购工作中大搞群众运动的经验。各地的经验说明，依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，环环抓思想，层层发动群众，是棉花收购中大搞群众运动的基本保证。进入9月份，河北省邯郸专区各县党委书记亲自挂帅，结合贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，运用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，向右倾畏难情绪展开了斗争；各公社普遍向农民进行工农联盟和总路线的教育，反复说明早摘勤摘和提高棉花品级，对国家对自己都有利，从而提高了广大农民摘棉售棉支援国家建设的积极性。全专区二百多万名男女社员投入了摘棉售棉运动，到10月15日就比去年提前六个月超额完成了原订的今年棉花收购任务，同时完成了麦田播种计划。这个事实使到会代表清楚地认识到，依靠党的领导，大搞群众运动，是一个无往不胜的法宝；加强具体领导，进行细致踏实的组织工作，合理地调配劳动力和运输力量，是开展群众性的棉花收购运动的重要环节。
    会议要求各地推广河北邯郸专区和山东临清等地统一领导的经验。他们的具体作法是：从县、公社、管理区一直到生产队，都建立棉花收购联合指挥部，由党委书记挂帅，统一规划调配人力，各生产队根据棉花产量和三秋生产任务的大小，分别组织摘棉、运棉、秋耕、种麦等专业队。
    棉花摘的快慢，摘的好坏，直接影响到收购工作的进度和棉花质量，因此，会议要求各地特别抓紧棉花采摘工作，做到地无熟棉、棉不进队、队不存棉，由地里一直送到加工厂、收购站。在收购方面，各地应适当增设收购站，派人到生产队验收，流动收购，设点保管等办法，作到棉花随到随收，一包不留。
    参加会议的一百九十七个重点县的代表，还向全国产棉县提出倡议，保证提前超额完成棉花收购任务，不留尾巴。（附图片）
