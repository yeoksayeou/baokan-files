Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company exceeded the state plan for major products such as pig iron, steel, steel billets, and metallurgical coke in the first ten days of October. Among them, pig iron exceeded the plan by 0.26%, an increase of 5.2% over the same period in September; steel exceeded the plan by 5.5%, an increase of 24.3% over the same period in September. The First Steelmaking Plant produced 140 tons more high-quality steel than planned.

　　During the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Anshan Iron and Steel's iron and steel armies launched a production upsurge to strive for a "good start in October and a full victory in October," and carried out a vigorous technical performance competition. Employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant improved blast furnace operations, which stabilized the furnace conditions. On the first day of October, they exceeded the daily plan by 576 tons of pig iron. By the 10th, the plant had produced 3,705 tons more high-quality pig iron than planned. The employees of the Thirteen Rolling Mills have produced 5,869 tons more steel than planned in the first ten days of October.

　　Currently, all factories and mines are mobilizing the masses, summarizing the experience of the good start in October, and striving to achieve a full victory in October.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th: Good news poured in from Shanghai's iron and steel front in the first ten days of October. Steel production increased by 26% compared with the same period last month; steel production increased by 24% compared with the same period last month, which was 6.3% higher than the higher level in late September.

　　Entering October, Shanghai's steel workers adopted methods of mutual assistance, mutual promotion, and mutual learning, and repeatedly created new records in various positions. Employees of the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 overcame the difficulty of steel casting not keeping up with steelmaking. On October 1st, they created a high production record of 130 heats per day, producing 1,328 tons of steel. By the 10th, the workers in this workshop further strengthened the connection between steel casting and steelmaking, and created an even higher record of 152 heats per day, producing 1,482 tons of steel. Workers in the First Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 supported and cooperated with each other in the first ten days of October, insisting on using four to five converters for steelmaking, and created two new records of 504 tons and 516 tons per day on the 8th and 9th respectively.

　　Employees of various rolling mills also launched a record-breaking campaign to catch up with each other. Rolling mill workers of the New Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant exceeded the steel production plan every day from the 1st to the 9th, creating 23 new high-yield and high-quality records, with an average daily output increase of 10% compared to late September. Employees of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 launched a "one-dragon" competition, which made steel rolling production interlocked, with each link tightly connected, and output continued to rise.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: The two large blast furnaces of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), which overfulfilled the September plan, continued to leap forward in the first ten days of October. In the first ten days of October, the pig iron output of the two blast furnaces increased by 4,056.4 tons compared with the same period in September, with an average daily output level 3.6% higher than in September; the quality of pig iron also improved, with a qualified rate 4.3% higher than in September.

　　Entering October, all employees of the two blast furnaces attended work during the National Day holiday and insisted on production. A "one-dragon" competition contract was signed between the two blast furnaces, as well as between the blast furnaces and raw materials, pig iron casting, slag, and equipment maintenance, setting off a new upsurge in the competition. Leading cadres at all levels moved their luggage to the factory and fought day and night with the workers, thus ensuring the continuous increase in pig iron production.

　　In order to support the high production of WISCO's blast furnaces, the production of WISCO's Daye Iron Mine also achieved an all-round victory in the first ten days of October. Both ore supply and stripping completed more than 35% of the monthly plan, and the quality of the ore was all qualified. In the first ten days, the mine supplied WISCO's blast furnaces with a total of 46,369 tons of qualified ore, exceeding the planned supply by more than 1,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: The Daye Steel Plant launched a large-scale mass campaign to tackle key problems in production, focusing on weak links and key production points, which led to a straight-line increase in the output of steel and steel products. After overfulfilling the third quarter production plan, the daily output of steel and steel products in the first ten days of October increased significantly again. Among them, the daily output of converter steel and electric furnace steel increased by 12.27% compared with September.

　　After fully exposing and criticizing right-leaning and fear-of-difficulty sentiments, the plant formulated a production target in August to increase steel production by 30,000 tons and steel product production by 20,000 tons, completing this year's production plan twenty days ahead of schedule. In order to implement the production increase measures, they established a special organization to grasp the measures - the problem-solving headquarters, ranked the factory-wide key production points, formulated specific action plans, organized relevant departments to complete them within a time limit, and various workshops also established corresponding problem-solving groups and problem-solving commando teams. They boldly mobilized the masses, explained the situation to the workers, and assigned tasks. This launched a large-scale campaign to tackle key problems throughout the plant. Of the forty-five key production points proposed in the first problem-solving battle, thirty-three were solved in less than half a month. Due to the solution of a series of weak links in production and the strengthening of technical management, the daily output of converter steel in the converter workshop in the first ten days of October was more than double the daily output level in July.

　　Currently, the mass movement of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced is becoming more and more vigorous throughout the plant. Employees of the Second Steelmaking Department have continuously created sixteen new production records in the ten days of the first ten days of October, completing 36.48% of the monthly leap forward plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th: Employees of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and fiercely attacking key production points, resulting in new growth in production in the first ten days of October. Compared with the same period in September, steel increased by 10.6% in the first ten days of October, iron increased by 20.9%, and steel products increased by 4.7%.

　　At the end of September, the company's employees seriously summarized their experiences, formulated fourth-quarter production targets, and proposed specific measures to complete the targets. Entering October, the employees immediately launched a hot wave of finding key points and attacking key points. On the 7th, employees of the First Steelmaking Plant posted more than 300 big-character posters in one day, proposing many new suggestions and new measures for technical innovation and improvement of work. After employees of the Ironmaking Plant launched a collaboration to attack key points, the daily output of pig iron in the first ten days increased by 6.4% compared with the average daily output in September. After discussing and formulating the fourth-quarter target, the young blast furnace employees decided to make the blast furnace utilization coefficient reach three in October. The average utilization coefficient in the first ten days has reached 2.855, an increase of 0.265 compared with the same period in September.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: After achieving a good start in production in October, all employees of Tangshan Steel Plant achieved a full victory in the first ten days of October. The plant's steel ingot and steel product production have completed the national production plan for the first ten days one day and twenty-one hours ahead of schedule and one day and six hours ahead of schedule, respectively. Compared with the average daily output in late September, the daily output in the first ten days increased by 16.73% for steel ingots and 3.43% for steel products; the qualified rate of steel ingots increased by 0.78%, and the qualified rate of steel products reached 99.99%. Due to the reduction in pig iron consumption for steel ingots, the plant saved more than 1,000 tons of pig iron in the first ten days.

　　After completing the national plan for the third quarter and September ahead of schedule, all employees of this steel plant put forward the heroic slogan of "Let October become a red October, strive for a good start and a red day every day, and surpass September in October, and strive for glory at the heroes' meeting." They overcame difficulties such as low voltage and insufficient power, carried out large-scale collaboration, adopted the method of class-by-class accounting, and compensating for losses in the next class, and continuously won high yields. On October 2nd, they created the highest daily steel production record since this year - 2,005 tons, and on the 8th, they created an even higher record - 2,217 tons, achieving an all-round leap forward in high yield, high quality, and low consumption.
