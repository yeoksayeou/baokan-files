    Strive in the Fourth Quarter to Increase the Total Value of Agricultural Output
    2 Million People in Henan Vigorously Develop Diversified Economy
    Reject Right-Leaning Conservative Ideas, and Expand Production Projects
    (Our Newspaper's Report) Since entering the fourth quarter, the people of Henan Province have launched a new high tide of diversified economic production.
    According to recent statistics, the province has established 130,000 various factories (farms), organized more than 110,000 professional teams, and invested 2 million laborers in diversified economic production. As of the end of September, the total output value of diversified economy in the province reached 2.37 billion yuan, and the total income reached 1.08 billion yuan. Especially since July, after the implementation of the Provincial Party Committee's plan for diversified economy meetings, the development of diversified economy has been more rapid, and the total output value has risen sharply. August increased by 23% compared with July, and September increased more than three times compared with August. The total output value in the third quarter was 800 million yuan, an increase of 1.6 times compared with the second quarter, and the total income was 470 million yuan, an increase of 2.4 times compared with the second quarter. Calculated on the basis of the rural population, the average income per person reached 10.5 yuan.
    Recently, after studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and thoroughly exposing and criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, the commune members of the People's Communes in various places have further recognized the current excellent situation and have revised their targets and expanded their production projects, fighting hard in the fourth quarter to achieve a 5% increase in total agricultural output value on top of completing the original plan. Kaifeng Prefecture, based on the principle of overall consideration, decided that the labor force participating in diversified economic production would increase from the original 9% to 12% to 15% starting from October, and planned to achieve a diversified economic output value of 420 million yuan in the fourth quarter, equivalent to 38.18 yuan per person. In terms of production projects, taking hog production as the center, focusing on poultry, weaving, comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes, and short-distance transportation, a comprehensive development was carried out. Xinyang Prefecture also formulated a plan for the development of diversified economy in the fourth quarter based on the spirit of anti-rightist and boosting morale, requiring the total output value to reach 369 million yuan, striving to complete 150 million yuan in October, focusing on poultry hatching, wild vegetable collection, livestock feed reserve, and carrying out the livestock pregnancy campaign. It also required all counties to establish 10,000-hog farms, communes to establish 5,000-hog farms, and production teams to establish 1,000-hog farms, so that by the end of the year, collective pig raising would develop to 5.6 million hogs. Xuchang Prefecture decided to vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes in the fourth quarter, processing more than 300 million jin of sweet potatoes, and increasing the income of communes and commune members.
    Henan Province's diversified economic production is carried out according to a unified plan, with collective operation as the main focus, combined with decentralized operation. The Xiaguan and Qiliping People's Communes in Neixiang County are located in the resource-rich Funiu Mountains. These two communes fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes' large organizational scale, wide operating range, and easy unified arrangement of labor and unified use of funds, and specifically formulated a plan for the development of diversified economy. For production that has raw materials, uses more funds, and requires stronger technology in year-round production, such as mechanical repair, mining, and lacquer cutting, 158 professional teams were established, with 2,145 laborers invested, and production was carried out by collective operation. For production with strong seasonality, production was carried out by vigorously launching mass movements. Small-scale and decentralized production was carried out by decentralized operation, allowing commune members to carry out production without affecting collective production. In the past three months, the total output value of these two communes reached 2.64 million yuan, with a net income of 1.37 million yuan, and an average income of 37 yuan per person.
    When developing diversified economy, the People's Communes in various parts of Henan focused on major projects according to local resource conditions and according to the different seasons, while also paying attention to comprehensive development. In the third quarter, the focus of development was on the breeding and reproduction of livestock and poultry, the sowing and management of vegetables, and the manufacture and repair of production tools. As of now, the number of hogs in the province has increased by 29% compared with the end of June, and five counties and cities, including Linru, Luoshan, Biyang, Shangshui, and Xuchang City, have an average of more than two hogs per household; chickens have increased by 31% compared with the end of June, and Xinyang Prefecture has an average of two chickens per person, and Xincai, Huaibin, Guangshan, and Xuchang City have an average of three chickens per person. The average vegetable sowing area is 0.34 mu per person, an increase of two times compared with last year.

　　奋战第四季度　增加农业总产值
    河南二百万人大搞多种经营
    反掉右倾保守思想纷纷扩大生产项目
    本报讯　河南省人民在进入四季度以来，掀起了新的多种经营生产高潮。
    据最近统计，全省已建立各种厂（场）十三万个，组织各种专业队十一万多个，投入多种经营生产的劳力达二百万人。截至9月底，全省多种经营总产值达二十三亿七千万元，总收入达十亿八千万元。特别是从7月份以来，各地贯彻执行了省委多种经营会议的规划以后，多种经营发展更加迅速，总产值直线上升，8月份比7月份增长23％，9月份更比8月份增长三倍多。第三季度总产值八亿元，较第二季度增加一点六倍，总收入四亿七千万元，较第二季度增加二点四倍，按农村人口计算，平均每人收入达十元五角。
    最近，各地人民公社的社员在学习了八中全会的决议，彻底揭发和批判了右倾保守思想后，更进一步认清了当前的大好形势，纷纷修订指标，扩大生产项目，大战四季度，决心在完成原来农业总产值计划的基础上，再增产5％。开封专区根据统筹兼顾的原则，参加多种经营生产的劳力，决定从10月份起，由原来的9％增到12％到15％，计划第四季度多种经营产值达到四亿二千万元，每人合三十八元一角八分。在生产项目上，以生猪生产为中心，以家禽、编制、甘薯加工综合利用、短途运输为重点，全面大发展。信阳专区也根据反右倾、鼓干劲的精神，作出了第四季度发展多种经营规划，规划要求总产值达到三亿六千九百元，10月份争取完成一亿五千万元，重点抓家禽孵化、野菜采集、牲畜饲草储备和开展牲畜满怀运动，还要求各县大办万头猪场、公社办五千头猪场、生产队办千头猪场，到年底集体养猪发展到五百六十万头。许昌专区决定第四季度大搞甘薯综合利用，处理甘薯三亿多斤，增加公社和社员收入。
    河南省多种经营生产，是根据统一规划，以集体经营为主，结合分散经营的方针进行的。内乡县夏馆、七里坪人民公社位于物产丰富的伏牛山区，这两个社充分运用人民公社组织规模大，经营范围广，便于统一安排劳力，统一使用资金的优越性，具体制定了发展多种经营规划，对常年生产有原料，使用资金较多，技术较强的生产，如机械修配、采矿、割漆等生产，建立了一百五十八个专业队，投入二千一百四十五个劳力，采取集体经营的办法生产，对季节性强的生产，采取大搞群众运动的办法进行生产。属于小宗的、分散的，在不影响集体生产的原则下，采取分散经营，允许社员进行生产。这两个社，在三个月来，生产总值达二百六十四万元，纯收入一百三十七万元，每人平均收入三十七元。
    河南各地人民公社在发展多种经营时，根据当地资源情况，根据季节的不同，突出抓住了主要项目，同时也注意了全面发展。第三季度各地是以家畜家禽的配种、繁殖，蔬菜的播种、管理和生产工具的制造、修理为发展重点的，截止目前，全省生猪发展较6月底增长29％，每户平均达到两头以上的有临汝、罗山、泌阳、商水、许昌市等五个县市；鸡较6月底增长31％，信阳专区平均每人已达到二只鸡，新蔡、淮滨、光山、许昌市，每人平均已达到三只。蔬菜播种面积，平均每人达三分四厘，比去年增长了两倍。
