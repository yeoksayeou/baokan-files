    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th: Workers on the industrial and transportation front in Shanxi Province are greeting the upcoming "Conference of Heroes" to be held in the capital with new production achievements.

    Millions of workers in factories and mines throughout the province are looking forward to Beijing, determined to create outstanding achievements before the "Conference of Heroes" so that their representatives can report to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In recent days, factories and mines in industrial cities such as Taiyuan, Yangquan, and Datong have continuously reported successes in completing their annual plans ahead of schedule. In Taiyuan City, twenty-two factories and enterprises, twenty-six workshops and work areas, five hundred and fifty-seven teams, and tens of thousands of individuals have leaped into 1960. The advanced collective of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, which will send representatives to attend the National "Conference of Heroes," completed its annual plan ahead of schedule on October 14th. The daily production level of many factories and mines is steadily rising. In the first half of October, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's steel output increased by 13.7% and iron output by 20.4% compared to the same period in September. Workers at the Xishan Coal Mine also comprehensively overfulfilled their production plan for the first half of October.

    Workers in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the province continue to use the communist style of breaking superstitions and daring to think and act, innovating technology, and new achievements are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. After creating the "non-stop charging" experience, the Third Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has completed a major technological innovation—converter steelmaking without baking the furnace. The realization of this major technological innovation increases the operating rate of the converter by about one-third. Xu Baoshan, a worker in the forging and riveting workshop of the Shanxi Mining Machinery Factory, closely cooperated with the workshop's technician team, and successfully used a 70-ton press to trial-produce screw caps, improving work efficiency by more than five times.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th: In the wave of the Great Leap Forward in Tianjin, heroes have emerged in large numbers, and the city has more than five thousand advanced collectives and more than fifty thousand advanced producers. From the 16th to the 18th, Tianjin held a representative conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the fields of industry, transportation, basic construction, and finance and trade. All representatives unanimously proposed to hold high the red flag of the General Line together with the city's million workers, fight hard in the fourth quarter, ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule, and lay a solid foundation for a greater leap forward in 1960.

    During the meeting, more than 1,500 representatives widely exchanged advanced experiences. Among these representatives are Liu Baozhong, an old worker from the Tianjin Chemical Plant who constantly innovates technology and creates a large amount of wealth for the country; Shan Shu, an engineer from the Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant No. 1 who was born as a worker, who is consistently unafraid of difficulties, fights tenaciously, and is full of creative spirit; Sun Guizhen, a weaving worker from Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory who has completed and overfulfilled the state plan every year for ten years and has not had an accident for more than four consecutive years; Gao Huchen, a driver from Tianjin Automobile Transportation Company who loves state property and creates advanced fuel-saving experience; the city's "Five Good" group model—the Xiang Yulan group from Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, which has overfulfilled the state plan for 6 consecutive months up to September this year, increasing cotton yarn production by more than 80,000 pounds and saving more than 3,000 pounds of cotton for the country; Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant Boiler Team B, which has maintained safe power generation for 2,476 consecutive days up to September this year, saved 965 tons of coal and 166,000 kWh of electricity for the country from January to September this year, and increased production value for the country by 1,687,000 yuan, and other advanced individuals and advanced collectives. They introduced to the conference the brilliant achievements and rich experiences they have gained since continuing the Great Leap Forward this year, especially during the vigorous efforts in August and September, and expressed their determination to win even greater victories.

    Wan Xiaotang, First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Continue to Thoroughly Implement the Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Fight Decisively in the Fourth Quarter, and Strive to Complete the National Plan for This Year Half a Month Ahead of Schedule." He called on all the representatives present to continue to play a leading role and strive to complete the national plan fifteen days ahead of schedule in the red October and the decisive battle in the fourth quarter.

    The representatives present unanimously responded to the battle call put forward by the Municipal Party Committee. Many representatives put forward new guarantee conditions on the spot and launched friendly challenges and responses to each other. The Tianjin Machine Tool Plant's gear joint group, a pacesetter group that originally planned to complete the annual plan fifteen days ahead of schedule, decided to implement thirty more technical measures in the fourth quarter to complete this year's plan twenty days ahead of schedule.

    The conference elected 184 representatives to attend the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in the Fields of Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th: Workers on the industrial, basic construction, and transportation fronts in Harbin are seizing a complete success in October with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, creating new achievements, and welcoming the National "Conference of Heroes."

    At present, many factories and enterprises have put forward specific goals and guarantee measures. The workers of the First Construction Engineering Company of Harbin City are determined to complete the October plan ten days ahead of schedule, and strive to build a 4,000-square-meter industrial plant in twenty days. Now all the workers are involved in counterpart, opponent, and linkage competitions, etc. The three-story industrial plant of 4,000 square meters has completed two floors, and all the concrete columns have been hoisted. The rubber wire workshop of Harbin Wire Factory plans to produce 15,200 kilometers of rubber wire in the fourth quarter, and this task is very arduous. Inspired by the slogan "Present a Gift to the Conference of Heroes," the workers of the workshop actively improved the machine structure, making the efficiency doubled. The yarn-wrapped wire workshop of this factory also rose to catch up, changing the flat-lying machine from four heads to eight heads, doubling the output. This improvement alone can increase the production of 73.5 tons of yarn-wrapped wire by the end of the year. The workers of Harbin Power Machinery Manufacturing Plant have realized more than 20 technical innovations, and production has reached daily red. Red Flag Holder Mou Zizheng created the ventilator tire die method, which increased the efficiency by forty times. The casting workshop promoted the mud molding method, and the efficiency also increased by three times.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 18th: The workers of Fushun West Open-pit Mine have already overfulfilled the coal production plan for mid-October on the 15th. The workers guaranteed to increase coal production by 165,000 tons for the country in October to welcome the National Conference of Heroes.

    Since entering October, the workers of the West Open-pit Mine have promoted 105 advanced experiences, and launched a vigorous technical performance competition in the three main processes of open-pit coal mining—electric shovel loading, electric locomotive transportation, and overturning and unloading coal trucks, so that the technical level and coal production have risen step by step. In the past, it took an average of 15 minutes for a coal shovel to load a row of trucks. Through the technical performance competition, the time for loading a row of trucks has been shortened to 12 minutes, and some coal shovels only take 8 minutes to load a row of trucks. The Party committee secretary and the mine director and other leading cadres have adhered to participating in production and leading production, and constantly helped solve key problems in production. The No. 6 electric shovel coal mining face, due to the uneven terrain and poor transportation lines, the electric locomotive can only pull 11 coal trucks. After the leading cadres went down the pit, they immediately organized the workers to level the lines, so that the electric locomotive could pull 13 coal trucks, increasing transportation efficiency by 18%.
