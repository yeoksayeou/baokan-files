A Grand Review of Sports

The First National Games of the People's Republic of China, with its magnificent and colorful hues, its grand scale, and its brilliant achievements, was dedicated to the great holiday – the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

This sports meet was held under the cordial care of the Party and Chairman Mao. Our great leader Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders attended the opening ceremony of the National Games, giving us tremendous encouragement. The sports meet achieved unprecedented success. It was a general review of the great achievements of China's sports over the past decade and a milestone in the progress of China's sports undertakings to a new stage. It wrote an extremely glorious page in the history of Chinese sports.

During the National Games, seven athletes broke world records four times in swimming, parachuting, shooting, and aviation model projects. Six hundred and sixty-four people broke national records eight hundred and forty-four times in one hundred and six individual events. Thousands of athletes refreshed the highest scores of various sports in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. To achieve such a large-scale harvest in one sports meet is a victory for the Party's General Line on the sports front. Throughout the National Games, athletes responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held high the victorious banner of the General Line, went all out, aimed high, and strived to create personal, unit, national, and world records. After excellent swimmer Mu Xiangxiong created a world record of 1 minute 11.4 seconds in the 100-meter breaststroke at the end of 1958, he created a new record of 1 minute 11.3 seconds on the eve of the National Games. In the preliminary and semi-final rounds of the National Games, he made another attempt to break the world record. Because of his doubled efforts and striving for further progress, he finally created a new world record of 1 minute 11.1 seconds in the final. In the competitions of various sports, a large number of talented young players and outstanding collectives caught up with or surpassed the athletes and units that originally maintained the title of advanced. Seventeen-year-old table tennis player Li Furong was not afraid of strong opponents and defeated world champion Rong Guotuan. Fourteen-year-old young player Zhou Xiyang had only been learning diving for more than a year and jumped from a second-level athlete to a master athlete and national champion. Many players from rural and ethnic minority areas became winners of competitions and creators of national records. This situation of new people emerging in large numbers, new events springing up, endless succession, and the waves behind pushing the waves ahead is not only a manifestation of the thriving and vigorous vitality of various undertakings in our socialist motherland, but also a reflection of breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and promoting the communist style of daring to think and daring to act on the sports front.

In the competitions of various sports in the National Games, whether they were rookies or veterans, strong teams or weak teams, they all demonstrated the revolutionary heroic spirit of going all out, aiming high, fighting for every second, being brave and tenacious, and the excellent moral qualities of unity and fraternity, mutual help, mutual learning, not being arrogant in victory, and not being discouraged in defeat. After the National Games, China's football and basketball teams also showed this characteristic in friendly matches with fraternal countries' teams such as the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. All the referees and staff who participated in the National Games worked together and tirelessly contributed their strength to make the National Games successful and wonderful. This is the true color of Chinese people's athletes and sports workers who have been closely taught by our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao.

The National Games, with its grand scale, wonderful competitions and performances, and the noble style of the athletes, attracted and educated the broad masses and promoted various sports work. In the short period since the holding of the National Games and the end of the National Games, a new upsurge of people's more enthusiastic care for sports and participation in physical exercise has emerged. More than two million people visited various competitions of the National Games. People braved the rain to watch the games and cheer, and the news of the games was widely discussed in the streets and alleys. Workers, soldiers, students, and patriotic overseas Chinese from all over the country sent congratulatory telegrams and letters. The employees and members of the Communist Youth League of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Engineering Bureau on the Yellow River compared their efforts with the athletes by taking practical actions to better complete the water conservancy project. All the employees of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company were delighted and encouraged when they saw the good news in the newspaper that the Sichuan men's basketball team had won consecutive victories, and they congratulated the athletes by breaking the production target of 2,100 tons of steel per day. Shanghai, Gansu, Shandong, Qinghai, Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi and other places held sports meets and carried out colorful sports activities to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country and welcome the National Games. Tangshan City launched a month of national sports competition activities in September and October. Each county and city in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou Province launched a symbolic long-distance running movement of more than 2,700 kilometers, "Running to Beijing to Participate in the National Games," from the beginning of September. The profound impact of the National Games among the people of the whole country will play a huge role in the popularization of sports and the improvement of the level of sports technology in our country.

The successful holding and conclusion of the first National Games proved that China's sports undertakings have become a cause for the whole people under the leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao. China's sports, whether in terms of political ideology or sports technology, has been greatly improved and has laid a solid foundation. The Party's General Line has also yielded fruitful results and achieved brilliant victories on the sports front. The great achievements of the National Games are the crystallization of the development of China's sports undertakings over the past decade.

The Glorious Achievements of the Past Ten Years

Ten years ago, the working people of our country were subjected to the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism for a long time, and lived in dire straits. They did not have the conditions to participate in sports. The level of sports technology at that time was also very backward. Only one athlete had ever qualified for the finals in several Olympic Games. The backwardness of sports in old China was a reflection of the backwardness of the country's entire politics, economy, and culture. Since liberation, thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao's concern for the health of the people and vigorous promotion of sports, China's sports undertakings have begun a new journey. In the past ten years, with the development of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, with the development of national industrial and agricultural production and the daily improvement of people's material lives, sports have also developed rapidly. The broadcast gymnastics, which began to be promoted in 1952, has become a part of the daily life of the vast number of people in our country. Whether in the early morning or in the evening, people can be seen doing physical exercises with the radio music. The labor pre- and post-work exercises and field exercises of workers and peasants, and the inter-work and inter-class exercises of government cadres and students have formed a moving picture of "the sound of music is melodious, and everyone is competing to do exercises." Various sports teams and sports exercise groups are as numerous as stars. Whenever there are holidays or spare time, various sports competitions held on the sports fields of factories, mines, enterprises, schools, and government organs have greatly enlivened the amateur cultural life of the broad masses. The Labor and Defense System, which began to be promoted in 1954, further encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of young people to participate in physical exercise. Labor and Defense System exercise groups organized according to different genders and ages have sprung up in the vast number of grassroots units. Students in large and middle schools in cities across the country have basically passed the Labor and Defense System. National defense sports clubs have been established in many cities to carry out activities such as shooting, motorcycles, parachuting, radio, and water motorcycles, which have not only cultivated a group of aviation and navigation enthusiasts, but also cultivated a group of reserve forces for national defense. Especially in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, under the brilliant light of the General Line and under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the movement of everyone being a soldier, sports also showed a new situation of rapid progress and achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. Many areas have launched the "Ten-Minute Sports Exercise" movement, and the vast number of workers, peasants, cadres, students, and street residents have actively participated in physical exercise. Doing exercises, competing in skills, shooting guns, and practicing martial arts have become the new fashion of our times. By 1958, hundreds of millions of people across the country were regularly participating in sports, more than 25 million people had passed the Labor and Defense System standards, and more than 4 million people had reached the athlete level standards. Participating in sports and exercising has formed a widespread mass movement.

Based on the surging mass sports movement, a large number of excellent athletes have emerged. Under the cultivation of the Party, they have fully developed their sports talents, and their technical level has improved very rapidly. They have not only completely refreshed and greatly exceeded all the highest records of old China, but are also striding towards the world level. In 1956, Chinese athletes broke a world record three times. In 1957, three people broke three world records three times. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, nine people broke six world records eight times. In the first eight months of 1959, which continued to leap forward, 32 people broke 13 world records in 12 sports. To date, Chinese athletes have created and broken world records 31 times in 18 sports, including the lightest weight snatch, the featherweight snatch, the lightweight snatch, the light heavyweight snatch, women's high jump, men's 100-meter breaststroke, men's and women's parachuting, shooting, mountaineering, and aviation model. More than 3,600 national records have been broken. The results of many sports have also entered the ranks of the world level. In recent years, Chinese athletes have participated in many international competitions and achieved many victories. In the 25th World Table Tennis Championships held in March this year, Rong Guotuan won the title of world champion in men's singles. In women's singles, women's doubles, mixed doubles, and men's and women's team events, he won the third place. China's men's and women's basketball teams have defeated some famous European teams. China's weightlifting, track and field, and swimming athletes have won some victories in many international competitions. They have won honor for the motherland and are also the vanguards of China's sports technology level comprehensively advancing towards the world level.

The breadth of China's sports movement and the speed of improvement in sports technology level are not only unmatched by old China, but also beyond the reach of the capitalist world. Hundreds of millions of people participate in sports and have more than 4 million graded athletes. Such a broad mass base is something that the capitalist world dare not imagine and cannot achieve. In just ten years, we have reached the level of world record creators and world champions from a very backward level. This speed is also incomparable to the capitalist world. Taking weightlifting as an example, before liberation, only five levels had records in the seven weight classes, and the heavyweight score was only 325 kg. From 1956 to the present three years, not only have the scores of each level been greatly improved, but the lightest level total score has also reached 332.5 kg. Moreover, in the snatch of four weight classes, eleven world records have been created, three of which were maintained by American athletes who were once known as the "kingdom" of weightlifting. After the Americans created the world record of 132.5 kg for the lightest weight snatch sixteen years ago, they have not been able to improve this score by one step. However, the outstanding Chinese athlete Chen Jingkai has broken this world record four times since he broke this world record with a score of 133 kg in June 1956, raising the weight to 140.5 kg. Mountaineering has only been carried out in China for four or five years, but young Chinese mountaineers have repeatedly climbed peaks above 6,000 and 7,000 meters. In July this year, eight Han and Tibetan female athletes and male athletes together planted the solemn and beautiful five-star red flag on the summit of Mount Muztagata, the "Father of Ice Mountains," which is 7,546 meters above sea level, creating the world record for women's mountaineering. Most of these female mountaineers have been mountaineering for less than a year. No capitalist country currently has a woman who can climb to a height of 7,500 meters. Switzerland, which started women's mountaineering the earliest in the world, only reached 7,300 meters after 37 years from 1897. After another 21 years, in 1955, the Frenchwoman C. Gougang in the Swiss and French mixed mountaineering team surpassed this height, but her score was only 7,456 meters. People call the rapid development of China's sports a "miracle." If it is really a "miracle," it is the "miracle" created by the superiority of the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party.

In recent years, Chinese sports organizations and athletes have carried out frequent mutual visits and competitions with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, which has further enhanced the unity and fraternal friendship between socialist countries and promoted the improvement of each other's sports level. Mutual exchanges have been carried out with more than 40 countries in Europe, Asia, America, Africa, and Australia. These activities have also played a positive role in enhancing the understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries.

Three Basic Experiences of Sports

The achievements of China's sports in the past ten years are brilliant. Experience has proved that relying on the leadership of the Party and realizing the command of politics is the fundamental guarantee for the development of sports. Enhancing the people's physique and serving labor production and national defense construction is the fundamental policy of sports. Adhering to the mass line and combining popularization with improvement is the fundamental method for carrying out sports.

The reason why China's sports have been able to achieve such great achievements in the past ten years is due to the consistent attention and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the People's Government, to sports. As early as forty-two years ago, Chairman Mao wrote an article with insightful views to demonstrate the value of sports and the principle of attaching equal importance to moral, intellectual, and physical education. The Party has always insisted on advocating sports in revolutionary base areas and the people's army in the revolutionary war environment where material conditions were extremely difficult. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the state listed sports as an important part of socialist construction. Chairman Mao instructed that "developing sports and enhancing the people's physique" and called on the youth of the whole country to "have a good body, study well, and work well." The Party Central Committee put forward the instruction that "improving the people's health and enhancing the people's physique is an important political task of the Party" and "one of the important means of carrying out communist education to the working people," which fully reflects the Party's infinite concern for the people's health. Chairman Mao has always insisted on physical exercise, and now he often climbs mountains and swims, and has repeatedly crossed the Yangtze River, while inspecting work in various places. Chairman Mao's heroic and moving poems "Ten thousand miles across the Yangtze River, gazing at the sky of Chu. Regardless of the wind and waves, it is better than strolling in a leisurely courtyard. Today, I have leisure" are widely circulated by the people and encourage the people of the whole country, especially the younger generation, to participate in physical exercise.

In order to promote the development of sports and strengthen the leadership of sports work, the Party and the state established sports commissions in governments at all levels. Sports colleges and sports schools have been established in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and sports departments have been established in many normal colleges to train cadres for the development of sports. In recent years, more than 10,000 students have graduated from these schools. The state has also built many stadiums, gymnasiums, shooting ranges, and swimming pools, published a large number of sports newspapers and books, and established sports scientific research institutions.... At present, there are more than 4,000 large and medium-sized sports venues across the country. In large cities, there are modern and well-equipped stadiums, gymnasiums, and swimming pools. The newly built Beijing Workers' Stadium, which can accommodate 80,000 spectators, is an ideal venue for both athletes and spectators. All of this has created good conditions for the widespread development of sports.

The practice of China's sports in the past ten years has fully proved that only under the leadership of the Party can the development of sports be guaranteed and have unlimited broad prospects. On the contrary, if it deviates from the leadership of the Party, sports undertakings will accomplish nothing. However, the bourgeois rightists in the sports team opposed the leadership of the Party. Their frenzied attack against the Party and socialism launched in 1957 was an attempt to usurp the Party's leadership over sports work. Under the leadership of the Party, sports workers across the country resolutely fought back against the attack of the rightists, achieved a great victory in the struggle between the two roads in sports, and consolidated the Party's leadership over sports work, which cleared the way for the further development of China's sports and the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

The Great Leap Forward in sports since 1958 and this year's National Games have more profoundly illustrated that where the Party's leadership over sports work is strengthened and politics can be put in command, sports work is vigorous and successful. For example, last year, in order to adapt to the requirements of the vast number of working people for enhancing their physique in the Great Leap Forward in production, Party committees at all levels universally strengthened their leadership over sports work, so that sports in many cities, counties, and grassroots units quickly became popular. On the sports field, there are countless vivid examples of achieving results due to political command. Sports competitions not only compare technology, but also compare politics; not only compare physical strength, but also compare courage, wit, and strong will. The decisive factor of victory is not one, but the sum of various factors commanded by politics. At the National Games, leaders from all over the country went deep into the teams to conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological work, constantly opposed rightism, broke superstitions, and liberated thoughts. The athletes became more and more courageous and tenacious in the war. Many teams were still able to maintain their confidence and persevere in fighting even when they lost, and finally turned defeat into victory. Many rookies went all out and strived for the upper reaches, and finally overcame many difficulties to break world records and national records, which fully demonstrated the great power of political command, breaking superstitions, and liberating thoughts. Under the education of the Party, political command, "establishing communist ambitions and creating the highest world records" has become the motto for Chinese athletes to move forward on the road of being both red and expert.

The widespread development of sports has played a very beneficial and positive role in enhancing the people's physique, ensuring and coordinating the completion of production, learning, and work tasks. This is the fundamental reason why it is valued by the Party and welcomed by the masses. Because the purpose of the proletarian revolution and socialist construction is to develop production and continuously improve the people's material and cultural living standards. And whether for the development of production or the people's happy life, it requires people to have healthy bodies. If the body is not healthy, it will be difficult to exert one's full wisdom and talents to the fullest during labor production. Sports is a science that promotes physical health, and can promote human metabolism and continuously enhance people's physique. Many facts and the results of scientific research have proved that people who regularly participate in sports have a larger lung capacity than those who do not often participate in sports, the function of the heart is stronger than that of ordinary people, and physical strength, endurance, sensitivity, and speed are much stronger than those of ordinary people. If the people of our country all have strong bodies, they can persist in hard work on the production front, adapt to the requirements of modern arms on the national defense front, and become brave and strong soldiers. At the same time, sports is a means of carrying out communist education to the people. The process of going all out, striving for the upper reaches, and overcoming difficulties in participating in sports exercises and sports competitions is the process of cultivating courage and tenacity. A person who can seize the opportunity with a clear mind at the tense moment of winning or losing in a sports competition, and can grit his teeth and persevere to the end when his physical strength is not enough, can also charge into battle on various work fronts and be invincible. Carrying out sports has an indispensable role in cultivating laborers with communist consciousness, who are both able to write and fight, and are comprehensively developed.

Since 1958, many factories, schools, troops, and rural people's communes have followed the Party Central Committee's instruction that "the fundamental task of sports is to enhance the people's physique and serve labor production and national defense construction" and carried out sports activities around production, which have been welcomed by the broad masses and have achieved good results. For example, Gaotang County, Shandong Province, used production gaps and rest time to widely carry out field sports activities in conjunction with militia training. Especially after the people's communes, the collectivity of labor production has been greatly improved, which has created very favorable conditions for carrying out field sports activities. At the same time, because the content of field sports activities is rich, the equipment is simple, and it can reasonably regulate the labor and rest of the commune members, it has quickly developed in many people's communes. The result of Gaotang County's carrying out sports activities not only helps farmers quickly recover their physical strength and eliminate diseases, which is good for insisting on production, but also makes the farmers' cultural life increasingly rich. Therefore, the county is not only a red flag in national sports activities, but also an outstanding advanced county in national industrial and agricultural production. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's metal structure manufacturing plant, according to the rhythm of production, "do less when busy, do more when idle," after carrying out sports activities with workshops and departments as units, greatly enlivened the cultural life of employees and increased the health of employees. The employee attendance rate was 94% in the fourth quarter of 1958, and increased to 98.5% in the second quarter of this year, which played a positive role in promoting production. The production tasks completed in the second quarter of this year increased by 39.9% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Some factories and mines have also launched small competitions such as tug-of-war, rope skipping, weightlifting, ball games, and other content while carrying out labor competitions and mobilizing mutual competition groups and work sections to carry out sports competitions at the same time. Labor competitions are carried out during production, and small competitions are held during sports activities. Production and life are both carried out in full swing. Sports serve the cause of production and national defense construction. This is the fundamental difference between socialist sports and capitalist sports, and it is also the unswerving policy of our sports undertakings.

The leap forward development of China's sports is also inseparable from the implementation of the Party's mass line in sports work. Sports is a mass activity, which is related to the health and happiness of 650 million people and future generations. It is necessary to use the broad social forces and strive for the support and cooperation of all relevant parties. In recent years, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the military, and education, health, and other departments have given active support, listing sports work as one of their regular and important tasks, establishing special agencies and full-time cadres to manage sports work, holding national workers', military, and student sports meets, and convening sports work conferences in various systems, which have vigorously promoted the development of sports. As an assistant to the Party, the Communist Youth League has also listed physical exercise as the obligation of league members in the league charter. Under the promotion of league organizations at all levels, the vast number of young people in our country have become the most active and positive force in sports activities.

Everyone wants to be healthy, and everyone wants to work, so they all need to exercise. However, when the objective practical need for exercise has not yet become the subjective wish of the masses, it is necessary to enlighten the masses consciously through publicity and education in every possible way, cultivate the masses' interest in participating in sports, and make them feel the necessity of exercise and recognize the role of sports in promoting health. In recent years, we have promoted broadcast gymnastics and the Labor and Defense System, the athlete grading system, carried out various sports projects, held colorful small competitions, established many amateur sports schools for young people, and published a large number of sports newspapers and books. These are all to attract and enlighten the vast number of people to participate in sports, so that they can adhere to regular exercise, improve their sports technical level, and thus develop the habit of exercise and continuously improve their health level. In 1958, under the unified arrangement of Party committees, sports organizations in various places held "National Sports Leap Forward Month" or "National Sports Activity Week" to widely mobilize the masses to participate in sports activities, which made the sports landscape in urban and rural areas焕然一新. This fact fully proves that sports work must carry out mass movements under the leadership of the Party. This is the case for the popularization of sports, and so is the way to improve sports technical level. Since 1958, the mass mobilization to carry out technical innovation has improved the sports technical level particularly rapidly.

Excellent athletes such as Chen Jingkai, Zheng Fengrong, Mu Xiangxiong, Zhang Hong, and Rong Guotuan have emerged in the torrent of millions of sports enthusiasts. The emergence of these excellent talents has driven the development of various sports in our country. After the news that Rong Guotuan won the world championship came, many young people organized table tennis teams, and the sales of table tennis rackets in many places surged. In this National Games, many promising young table tennis players emerged. This is the relationship between popularization and improvement, and the two are two aspects of the same thing, and neither can be neglected. If we emphasize improvement and ignore popularization, we will not only fail to achieve the purpose of improving people's health, but also lead to championshipism, which is the sports ideology of the bourgeoisie. Conversely, if we only want popularization and do not want improvement, sports will not be consolidated and further developed without the encouragement and guidance of improvement. Improving on the basis of popularization and further popularizing under the guidance of improvement are closely combined and promote each other. This is the law of development of China's sports. It can be expected that continuing to deeply implement and use the "magic weapon" of carrying out mass movements will make sports more popular and regular, and the technical aspects of sports will be able to catch up with the world's advanced level more quickly.

Continue to Leap Forward on the Road of Victory

When we excitedly look back at the brilliant achievements of the socialist construction of the motherland and the great development and leap forward of the people's sports movement in the past ten years, especially since 1958, we are more confidently looking forward to the future. The Party and the state have given us all the conditions to develop sports undertakings, and the people are very fond of sports, especially through the holding of the National Games, which has driven the development of the entire sports undertaking. More than 50 million people participated in the selection at all levels of the National Games, and a large number of new talents emerged, and many new records appeared, which vigorously promoted the development of mass sports and the improvement of sports technical level; through the "big classroom" of the National Games, a large number of cadres were trained and cultivated, and extremely rich experience was obtained. The political ideology and technical level of athletes, coaches, and referees have been greatly improved, which is very beneficial to promoting the further development of sports. At present, under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people of the whole country are launching a vigorous new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, and all undertakings are leaping forward. Sports work should also go all out and continue to leap forward on the road of victory.

Sports workers and athletes across the country, let us closely unite around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, continue to carry out mass movements in terms of popularization and improvement, and strive to realize the ten-year plan for sports, catch up with the world level in major sports in the shortest period of time, enhance the people's physique, and make people better serve labor production and national defense!

    飞跃前进的我国体育事业
    体育运动委员会副主任　荣高棠
        体育运动的大检阅
    中华人民共和国第一届运动会，以它绚烂瑰丽、万紫千红的色彩，以它浩大的声势和辉煌的成就，献给了伟大的节日——建国十周年。
    这次运动会是在党和毛主席的亲切关怀下举行的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席及党和国家的领导同志出席了全运会的开幕式，给了我们以巨大的鼓舞。运动会取得了空前未有的成绩，它是十年来我国体育运动获得巨大成就的总检阅；也是我国体育事业走向一个新阶段的里程碑。在我国体育史上，写下了极其光辉的一页。
    在全运会期间，有七名运动员在游泳、跳伞、射击和航空模型等项目中四次打破世界纪录；六百六十四人，八百四十四次打破一百零六个单项的全国纪录；数以千计的运动员刷新了省、市、自治区的各项运动的最高成绩。在一次运动会中，获得这样大面积的丰收，这是党的总路线在体育战线上的胜利。在整个全运会期间，运动员们响应了党的八届八中全会的号召，高举总路线的胜利旗帜，鼓足干劲，力争上游，争取创造本人、本单位、全国和世界纪录。优秀的游泳运动员穆祥雄，在1958年底创造1分11秒4的百米蛙泳世界纪录以后，在全运会前夕又创造了1分11秒3的新纪录。在全运会的预赛和复赛中，他又作了冲击世界纪录的尝试。由于干劲一鼓再鼓，上游力争再争，终于在决赛中创造了1分11秒1的世界新纪录。在各项运动的竞赛中，大量有才能的年青选手和优秀集体，赶上或超过了原来保持先进称号的运动员和单位。十七岁的乒乓球选手李富荣不畏强手，力挫世界冠军容国团；十四岁的少年选手周希洋，学习跳水只有一年多时间，从二级运动员一跃而成为运动健将和全国冠军；许多来自农村和少数民族地区的选手，成为比赛的优胜者和全国纪录创造者。这种新人辈出，新事丛生，生生不已，后浪追前浪的形势，不仅是我们社会主义祖国各项事业欣欣向荣，充满强大生命力的表现，也是体育战线上破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想、敢干的共产主义风格的体现。
    在全运会各项运动的竞赛中，无论是新手或老手，强队或弱队，都表现了鼓足干劲，力争上游，分秒必争，勇敢顽强的革命英雄主义气概和团结友爱，互相帮助，互相学习，胜既不骄，败也不馁的优良道德品质。在全运会结束后，我国足、篮球队在和苏联、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚等兄弟国家球队的友谊比赛中，也表现了这种特色。参加全运会的全体裁判员和工作人员，为了使全运会开得好，开得精采，同心协力，孜孜不倦地供献了自己的力量。这是我们伟大的党、伟大的领袖毛主席亲切教导下的我国人民运动员和体育工作者的本色。
    全运会以它盛大的规模，精采的竞赛和表演，以及运动员们高尚的风格，吸引和教育了广大的群众，推动了各项体育工作。在举行全运会和全运会结束以来的短短期间，已经出现了人们更加热情关怀体育事业，参加体育锻炼的新的高潮。有两百多万人次参观了全运会的各项比赛，人们冒雨观战助威，街头巷尾纷纷议论比赛的消息。各地工人、战士、学生以及海外爱国侨胞，纷纷发来贺电、贺信。黄河刘家峡水电工程局的职工和共青团员，以更好地完成水利工程的实际行动同运动员比干劲；重庆钢铁公司的全体职工从报上看到四川男子篮球队连战皆捷的喜报，欢欣鼓舞，用突破日产二千一百吨钢的生产指标向运动员祝贺。上海、甘肃、山东、青海、湖北、河南、江西等地，为庆祝建国十周年和迎接全运会，纷纷举行运动会，开展丰富多彩的体育活动。唐山市在9、10月份开展了全民体育竞赛活动月；贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州的各个县、市，从9月初就开展了全程二千七百多公里的“跑到北京去，参加全运会”的象征性长跑运动。全运会在全国人民中间引起的深刻的影响，无论对我国体育运动的普及和运动技术水平的提高，都将起着巨大的作用。
    第一届全国运动会的胜利举行和结束，证明了我国体育运动事业在党和毛主席的领导和关怀下，已经成为全民的事业。我国的体育运动，无论是政治思想方面和运动技术方面，都有了很大的提高，并打下了坚实的基础。党的总路线在体育战线上也结出了丰硕的成果，获得了辉煌的胜利。全运会的巨大成就，正是十年来我国体育事业发展的结晶。
        十年来的光辉成就
    十年以前，我国劳动人民长期受着帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削，生活在水深火热之中，没有条件去参加体育运动。当时的运动技术水平也十分落后，几次参加国际奥林匹克运动会，只有一个选手获得过决赛权。旧中国体育运动的落后，也正是国家整个政治、经济、文化落后的一种反映。解放以来，由于党和毛主席关怀人民的健康，大力提倡体育运动，我国的体育事业才开始了一个新的里程。十年来，随着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的发展，随着国家工、农业生产的发展和人民物质生活的日益改善，体育运动也得到了迅速的开展。从1952年开始推行的广播体操，已经成为我国广大人民日常生活中的一部分。无论是清晨或傍晚，都可以看到人们随着广播乐曲在做健身体操。工农群众的劳动前后操和田间操，机关干部和学生中的工间操和课间操，形成了“乐曲声悠扬，人人竞做操”的动人图景。各种运动队和体育锻炼小组多若繁星，每当假日或业余时间，厂矿、企业、学校、机关的运动场上举行的各种项目的运动竞赛，大大活跃了广大群众的业余文化生活。从1954年开始推行的劳卫制，进一步鼓舞了广大青、少年参加体育锻炼的热情。按照不同性别、年龄组织起来的劳卫制锻炼小组，在广大的基层单位中纷纷出现。全国城市里的大、中学校的学生基本通过了劳卫制。在许多城市建立了国防体育俱乐部，开展了射击、摩托车、跳伞、无线电和水上摩托等项活动，不仅培养了一批航空、航海事业的爱好者，也培养了一批国防力量的后备军。特别是在大跃进的1958年中，在总路线光辉的照耀下，在大跃进、人民公社化和全民皆兵运动的推动下，体育运动也呈现了突飞猛进的新局面，取得了史无前例的大跃进。许多地区开展了“十分钟体育锻炼”的运动，广大工人、农民、干部、学生和街道居民，都踊跃地参加了体育锻炼。做操竞技、打枪习武已成为我们时代的新风尚。到1958年止，全国已有成亿的人经常参加体育运动，有二千五百多万人通过劳卫制标准，四百多万人达到运动员等级标准。参加体育运动，锻炼身体，已经形成广泛的群众运动。
    在汹涌澎湃的群众性体育运动的基础上，涌现出了大批的优秀运动员。他们在党的培育下，充分发挥了运动才能，技术水平提高得十分迅速，不仅全部刷新和大大超过了旧中国的全部最高纪录，而且正在阔步跨向世界水平。1956年，我国运动员有一人三次打破一项世界纪录，1957年有三人三次打破三项世界纪录。大跃进的1958年有九人八次突破六项世界纪录。在继续跃进的1959年头八个月中，就有三十二人在十二个项目中打破十三次世界纪录。到目前为止，我国运动员在举重运动的最轻级挺举、次轻级挺举、轻量级挺举、轻重量级挺举、女子跳高、男子百米蛙泳、男、女跳伞、射击以及登山、航空模型等十八个运动项目中，三十九人创造和打破了世界纪录三十一次。突破全国纪录的，共有三千六百多次。不少项目的成绩，也已经步入了世界水平的行列。近几年来，我国运动员参加了许多次国际比赛，取得了多次胜利。在今年3月举行的第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛中，容国团荣获了男子单打世界冠军的称号，在女子单打、女子双打、男女混合双打以及男、女团体赛中，都获得第三名；我国的男、女篮球队战胜过欧洲一些著名的球队；我国的举重、田径、游泳运动员在多次国际比赛中，都获得过一些胜利。他们为祖国争取了荣誉，也是我国运动技术水平全面地向世界水平进军的尖兵。
    我国体育运动的广泛性和运动技术水平提高的速度，不仅旧中国无与伦比，资本主义世界也望尘莫及。成亿的人民参加了体育运动，拥有四百多万等级运动员。这样广泛的群众基础是资本主义世界不敢设想，也不可能实现的事。在短短的十年里，我们从一个十分落后的水平达到一个出现世界纪录创造者和世界冠军的水平，这种速度也是资本主义世界不能比拟的。以举重运动为例，解放前，在七个级别中只有五个级别有纪录，重量级的成绩只有三百二十五公斤。从1956年到现在的三年中间，不仅各个级别的成绩都有了巨大的提高，最轻级总成绩也达三百三十二点五公斤。而且在四个级别的挺举中，创造了十一次世界纪录，其中有三个是曾经号称为举重运动的“王国”——美国选手所保持的。美国人在十六年前以一百三十二点五公斤创造了最轻级挺举世界纪录以后，再未能使这个成绩提高一步，而我国优秀运动员陈镜开，从1956年6月以一百三十三公斤的成绩突破这项世界纪录以来，又接连四次刷新了纪录，把重量提高到一百四十点五公斤。登山运动在我国开展还只有四、五年的历史，但是年轻的中国登山运动员已经多次登上六、七千米以上的高峰。今年7月，八名汉族和藏族女运动员和男运动员一起，把庄严美丽的五星红旗插上了拔海七千五百四十六米的“冰山之父”——慕士塔格山的顶峰，创造了女子登山的世界纪录，这些女登山运动员的登山历史大都还不到一年。资本主义国家目前还没有一个女子能登上七千五百米的高度。世界上开展女子登山运动最早的瑞士，从1897年开始，搞了三十七年，仅达到七千三百米，又经过二十一年，到1955年，才有瑞士和法国的混合登山队中的法国人克·郭刚越过了这个高度，但是她的成绩也还只有七千四百五十六米。对于我国体育运动的迅速发展，人们称它是“奇迹”，如果真是“奇迹”的话，这就是社会主义制度的优越性和共产党领导所创造的“奇迹”。
    这些年来，我国体育组织和运动员与苏联及其他兄弟国家进行了频繁的互相访问和比赛，进一步增进了社会主义国家之间的团结和兄弟般的友谊，也促进了相互之间运动水平的提高。与欧、亚、美、非、澳等洲的四十多个国家，进行了相互来往活动。这些活动，对增进我国人民与各国人民之间的了解和友谊，也起着积极的作用。
      体育运动的三个基本经验
    十年来我国体育运动所取得的成就是光辉灿烂的，经验证明：依靠党的领导，实现政治挂帅是发展体育运动的根本保证；增强人民体质，为劳动生产和国防建设服务，是体育运动的根本方针；坚持群众路线，使普及与提高相结合，是开展体育运动的根本方法。
    十年来我国体育运动能够取得这样巨大的成就，是由于党和毛主席，以及人民政府对体育运动的一贯重视和正确领导的结果。毛主席早在四十二年前就以精辟的观点著文论证体育的价值和德、智、体三育并重的道理。党在物质条件极端困难的革命战争环境里，一直坚持在革命根据地和人民军队中倡导体育运动。中华人民共和国成立后，党和国家把体育运动列为社会主义建设的重要组成部分。毛主席指示“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，号召全国青年做到“身体好、学习好、工作好”。党中央提出“改善人民的健康状况，增强人民体质，是党的一项重要政治任务”，是“向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一”的指示，充分体现了党对人民身体健康的无限关怀。毛主席一贯坚持体育锻炼，如今也常在赴各地视察工作之余，登山、游泳，多次横渡长江天险。毛主席写下的“万里长江横渡，极目楚天舒。不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步，今日得宽余”的豪迈动人的诗词，为广大人民争相传诵，也鼓舞着全国人民，特别是青年一代参加体育锻炼的热情。
    党和国家为了推动体育运动的发展，加强体育工作的领导，在各级政府中成立了体育运动委员会。并在各省、市、自治区普遍建立了体育学院和体育学校，在许多师范学院里设立体育系科，为体育事业的发展培养干部。几年来从这些学校里毕业的学生有一万多人。国家还修建了许多体育场、体育馆、射击场、游泳池，出版了大量的体育报刊和图书，建立了体育科学研究机构……。到目前，全国已有大、中型体育场地四千多个，大城市中，都已有现代化的、设备完善的体育场、馆和游泳池。新建成的能容八万观众的北京工人体育场，无论对运动员和观众都是很理想的场地。这一切，为体育运动的广泛开展创造了良好的条件。
    十年来我国体育运动的实践充分证明：只有在党的领导下，体育运动的发展才有保证，才能有无限广阔的前途。相反，如果脱离了党的领导，体育事业必将一事无成。但是体育队伍中的资产阶级右派分子反对党的领导。他们在1957年发动的反党、反社会主义的猖狂进攻，就是企图篡夺党对体育工作的领导权。全国体育工作者在党的领导下对右派分子的进攻给予了坚决反击，取得了体育运动中两条道路斗争的巨大胜利，巩固了党对体育工作的领导，为我国体育运动的进一步发展，为1958年的大跃进扫清了道路。
    1958年以来的体育大跃进和今年的全国运动会，更深刻地说明了哪里的体育工作加强了党的领导，能够政治挂帅，哪里的体育工作就有朝气、有成绩。像去年，为了适应生产大跃进中广大劳动人民对增强体质的要求，在工农业生产大跃进的同时，各级党委普遍加强了对体育工作的领导，使许多市、县和基层的体育运动迅速得到普及。在运动场上，由于政治挂帅出成绩的生动事例，更是层出不穷。运动竞赛不仅要比技术，还要比政治；不仅要比体力，还要比勇敢、机智，比意志坚强。胜利的决定因素不是一个，而是以政治为统帅的各个因素的总和。在全运会上，各地领导深入到队，进行深入细致的思想工作，不断反对右倾，破除迷信，运动员越战越勇，越赛越顽强。许多球队在失利的情况下，仍能信心百倍地坚持奋战，终于转败为胜。不少新手鼓足干劲，力争上游，终于克服重重困难打破世界纪录、打破国家纪录的事例，都充分显示了政治挂帅，破除迷信，解放思想的巨大威力。在党的教育下，政治挂帅，“立共产主义大志，创世界最高纪录”，已成为我国运动员在红透专深道路上迈进的座右铭。
    体育运动的广泛开展对增强人民体质，对保证和配合生产、学习、工作任务的完成，起了十分有益的积极作用。这是它受到党的重视和群众欢迎的根本原因。因为无产阶级革命和社会主义建设的目的是发展生产，不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。而无论对发展生产或人民的幸福生活来说，都要求人们具有健康的身体。如果身体不健康，劳动生产时就会感到力不从心，就很难把自己的全部智慧才能最充分地发挥出来。体育是一门促进身体健康的科学，能够促进人体的新陈代谢，不断增强人的体质。许多事实和科学研究的结果，都证明经常参加体育运动的人，肺活量要比不常参加体育活动的人来得大，心脏的作用要比一般人来得强，体力、耐久力、灵敏和速度也就比一般人强得多。如果我国人民，人人都有健壮的身体，就可以在生产战线上坚持苦战，在国防战线上适应现代化各兵种的要求，成为勇武坚强的战士。同时，体育运动是向人民进行共产主义教育的一种手段。在参加体育锻炼以及运动比赛中，鼓干劲，争上游，克服困难的过程，就是培养勇敢精神和顽强意志的过程。一个人，在运动比赛中，能够在胜负千钧一发的紧张关头，头脑清醒的抓住战机，能够在体力不支的情况下，咬紧牙关坚持到底，有了这种品质，就同样能在各个工作战线上冲锋陷阵，无坚不摧。开展体育运动，对培养具有共产主义觉悟的、能文能武、全面发展的劳动者有着不可忽视的作用。
    1958年以来，许多工厂、学校、部队和农村人民公社，遵循着党中央关于“体育运动的根本任务是增强人民体质，为劳动生产和国防建设服务”的指示，围绕生产，开展了体育活动，受到广大群众的欢迎，收到良好效果。如山东省高唐县利用生产间隙和休息时间，结合民兵训练，广泛开展了田间体育活动。尤其是公社化以后，劳动生产的集体性大为提高，为开展田间体育活动造成了十分有利的条件；同时由于田间体育活动的内容丰富，设备简单，能合理地调节社员劳动和休息，所以很快在许多人民公社中发展起来。高唐县开展体育活动的结果，不仅有助于农民迅速恢复体力，消除疾病，对坚持生产有好处，也使农民的文化生活日益丰富。因而，该县既是全国体育活动的一面红旗，又是全国工农业生产出色的先进县。武汉钢铁公司金属结构制造厂，根据生产的节奏，
  “忙时少搞，闲时多搞”，以车间、科室为单位开展体育活动后，大大活跃了职工的文化生活，增进了职工的健康。职工出勤率1958年第四季度为94％，今年第二季度提高到98.5％，对促进生产起着积极的作用，今年第二季度完成的生产任务，较去年第四季度提高了39.9％。还有些厂矿在开展劳动竞赛的基础上，发动互相竞赛的小组、工段同时开展体育比赛活动，在生产时进行劳动竞赛；在体育活动时，就举行像拔河、跳绳、举重、球类以及其他内容的小型比赛，生产和生活都搞得热火朝天。体育运动为生产为国防建设事业服务，这是社会主义体育运动与资本主义体育运动的根本区别，也是我们的体育运动事业不可动摇的方针。
    我国体育运动的飞跃发展，也是和体育工作贯彻党的群众路线分不开的。体育运动是群众性活动，是关系到六亿五千万人民和子孙后代健康、幸福的大事，必须运用广大社会力量，争取各有关方面的支持和合作。几年来，工会、共青团、军队和教育、卫生等部门给予了积极的支持，把体育工作列为自己的经常重要任务之一，设立专门机构和专职干部管理体育工作，举办全国性的工人、军队、学生运动会，召开各系统体育工作会议，有力地推动了体育运动的发展。作为党的助手的共青团，更在团章中把锻炼身体列为团员的义务。我国广大青、少年在各级团组织的推动下，成为体育活动中最活跃、最积极的力量。
    人人要健康，人人要劳动，就都需要锻炼身体。但是，当锻炼身体这种客观实际需要，还没有成为群众的主观愿望时，就要通过宣传教育，千方百计地启发群众的自觉，培养群众参加体育运动的兴趣，使他们感到锻炼身体的必要，认识到体育运动对于增进健康的作用。几年来，我们推行了广播操以及劳卫制、运动员等级制，开展各种各样的体育项目，举办丰富多彩的小型竞赛，建立许多青少年业余体育学校，出版大量的体育报刊和图书，这些都是为了吸引和启发广大群众参加体育运动的兴趣和认识，使他们坚持经常的锻炼，提高运动技术水平，从而养成锻炼身体的习惯，不断地提高健康水平。1958年，各地体育组织在党委统一安排下，举办了“全民体育跃进月”或“全民体育活动周”，广泛发动群众参加体育活动，使城乡体育面貌焕然一新。这一事实充分证明体育工作必须在党的领导下大搞群众运动。体育运动的普及是如此，提高运动技术水平的途径也是如此，1958年以来发动群众大搞技术革新，运动技术水平就提高得特别迅速。
    在千百万体育爱好者的洪流中涌现出像陈镜开、郑凤荣、穆祥雄、张鋐、容国团等优秀运动员。这些优秀人材的出现，又带动了我国各项运动的发展。容国团荣获世界冠军的消息传来后，许多青、少年纷纷组织乒乓球队，许多地方乒乓球拍销售量激增。在这次全运会中，就出现了许多很有前途的青、少年乒乓球选手。这就是普及与提高的关系，二者是一件事情的两个方面，不能偏废。如果强调提高，忽视普及，就不仅达不到增进人民健康的目的，而且会导致锦标主义，这是资产阶级的体育思想。反之，只要普及，不要提高，普及得不到提高的鼓舞和指导，体育运动就不能巩固和进一步发展。在普及基础上提高，在提高指导下进一步普及，二者紧密结合又互相推动，这是我国体育运动的发展规律。可以预期，继续深入地贯彻和运用大搞群众运动这个“法宝”，体育运动便能更加普及和经常，运动技术方面便能更迅速地赶上世界先进水平。
        在胜利的道路上继续跃进
    当我们兴奋地回顾十年来，尤其是1958年以来祖国的社会主义建设辉煌成就和人民体育运动的大发展、大跃进的时候，我们更充满信心地展望未来。党和国家给了我们发展体育事业的一切条件，人民群众又十分爱好体育运动，特别是通过全运会的召开，带动了整个体育事业的发展。有五千多万人参加了全运会的各级选拔，涌现了大批新人材，出现了许多新纪录，有力地推动了群众性体育运动的发展和运动技术水平的提高；通过全运会这个“大课堂”，锻炼和培养了大批干部，取得了极其丰富的经验。运动员、教练员、裁判员的政治思想和技术水平大大提高，这对促使体育运动的进一步发展十分有利。目前，全国人民在党的八届八中全会伟大号召下，正掀起一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约新高潮，各项事业都在大跃进，体育工作也应鼓足干劲，在胜利的道路上继续跃进。
    全国体育工作者和运动员们，让我们紧紧地团结在党中央和毛主席周围，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，继续在普及和提高方面大搞群众运动，为提早实现体育运动的十年规划，为在最短期间在主要运动项目上赶上世界水平，为增强人民体质，使人们更好地为劳动生产与国防服务而奋勇前进。
