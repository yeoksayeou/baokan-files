Greetings from Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the National Committee of the Communist Party of India, extend the warmest congratulations and best wishes to the Chinese people and the beloved Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong. The delegation of the Communist Party of India considers it a great honor to be able to gather with you, comrades and friends, in Beijing on this grand occasion to celebrate together.

Ten years ago, the long and heroic struggle of the Chinese people led by the Communist Party won the victory of the people's democratic revolution and established the People's Republic of China. This was a historically significant event not only for the Chinese people, but also for all peace-loving and freedom-loving people. This victory has liberated hundreds of millions of Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism; this victory has indeed opened up a new era of comprehensive development and prosperity. Under the brilliant leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the socialist revolution has been victorious, and the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man has come to an end. With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Chinese people are advancing at an unprecedented speed and with steps admired by the world in building their own country and in all aspects of creative activity. Tremendous upsurges have appeared in agriculture, industry, and all other economic sectors. The Great Leap Forward demonstrates every day the enormous creativity that has been liberated. The cultural life of the Chinese people, integrating the rich and brilliant heritage of the past with the new vibrant creations of today, has also reached a climax.

The Indian people, who are currently engaged in building their own country, deeply appreciate the achievements and victories of the friendly Chinese people. No wonder we study every measure you have taken in creative activities with great interest and admiration.

The Chinese people's revolution and the ten years of experience of the People's Republic of China are a powerful proof of the superiority of Marxist-Leninist thought. For many years, the Chinese people have been fighting against imperialism and feudalism, and when they responded to the Great October Socialist Revolution and fought according to the teachings of Lenin, the master of the October Revolution, they found the correct path to liberate themselves. At present, the People's Republic of China has emerged as a great socialist power, greatly strengthening the strength and unity of the entire socialist camp, and also promoting the struggle for socialism throughout the world.

The victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China have dealt a devastating blow to world imperialism. The Asian and African people who are defending their newly acquired freedom or are striving for national independence have gained the most powerful support and encouragement from the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and from the People's Republic of China. At present, the balance of power has decisively shifted in favor of peace-loving people, and imperialism is clearly retreating in the face of the progress of national liberation forces. The days of imperialist rule supreme are gone forever. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind.

The People's Republic of China's contribution to the cause of world peace and the cause of Asian-African solidarity is of historical significance. Whenever world peace is threatened, the People's Republic of China always stands at the forefront of defending this cause. We recall with pride that China and India together, in their famous Panchsheel Agreement, specifically expressed the principles of peaceful coexistence. The Bandung spirit also owes much to the cooperation between these two countries. The friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and India, which have a population of one billion, is in itself a great force for peace and freedom.

However, we realize that the friendly relations between China and India have unfortunately become strained recently. Such friendly relations are essential not only for the people of the two countries, but also for the people of Asian and African countries. The United States and other imperialists are trying their best to take advantage of this unpleasant situation to further achieve their sinister goals. But we are deeply convinced that no matter what differences exist at present, these differences will undoubtedly be eliminated, and the friendship between China and India will continue to serve the cause of mankind. In the relations between these two countries, there is no problem that cannot be resolved in the spirit of the Five Principles through friendly consultation and negotiation. In the past, we had two thousand years of harmonious relations and cultural exchanges; at present, we are also faced with the common task of advancing the historical process of national liberation and safeguarding world peace.

The Chinese people have already achieved great and epoch-making achievements. As you celebrate your tenth anniversary of victory, we hope that you will achieve even greater achievements.

Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the great Chinese people engaged in socialist construction!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!
Long live the friendship between China and India!
Long live Asian-African solidarity and world peace!

    印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士的贺词
    在中华人民共和国成立十周年之际，我代表印度共产党全国委员会，向中国人民及以毛泽东同志为首的人民所敬爱的共产党，致以最热烈的祝贺和最好的祝愿。印度共产党代表团认为，在这一盛大的时机能同你们——同志们和朋友们相聚在北京共同欢庆，这是很大的荣幸。
    十年前，共产党所领导的中国人民的长期的英勇斗争，已经获得了人民民主革命的胜利，并成立了中华人民共和国。这不仅是中国人民、而且是整个爱好和平与自由的人类的一个富有重大历史意义的事件。这个胜利已经使亿万中国人民摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的枷锁而获得解放；这个胜利的确已经开辟了一个全面发展和繁荣昌盛的崭新的纪元。在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的光辉领导下，社会主义革命业已获得胜利，人剥削人的现象已告结束。在苏联及其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的援助下，中国人民在建设自己的国家和在各方面的创造性活动中，正在以空前的速度和使全世界敬佩的步伐向前迈进。农业、工业和其他一切经济部门都出现了极大的高涨。大跃进每天都显示出已经解放了的巨大的创造力。中国人民把过去丰富而光辉的遗产同今天新的生气勃勃的各种创造融合起来的文化生活，也达到了高潮。
    目前正从事于建设自己国家的工作的印度人民，深深地赞赏友好的中国人民的成就和胜利。无怪乎我们带着浓厚的兴趣和敬佩心情来研究你们在创造性的活动中所采取的每个措施。
    中国人民的革命和中华人民共和国十年的经历，是马克思列宁主义思想的优越性的一个有力的证明。中国人民多少年来一直同帝国主义和封建主义进行斗争，而当他们响应伟大的十月社会主义革命，按照十月革命的匠师列宁的学说去进行斗争时，就找到了解放自己的正确道路。目前，中华人民共和国已经以一个伟大的社会主义大国而出现，大大地加强了整个社会主义阵营的力量和团结，也促进了全世界为争取社会主义的斗争。
    中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，使世界帝国主义遭受了一次毁灭性的打击。正为保卫他们新近获得的自由，或者正在争取民族独立的亚非人民，从中国人民革命的胜利，从中华人民共和国获得了最有力的支持和鼓舞力量。目前力量的对比已经具有决定性地趋向有利于爱好和平人民的方面，帝国主义在民族解放力量进展的面前正在明显地退却。帝国主义统治至高无上的日子已经一去不复返了。正如毛泽东同志所说的，东风压倒西风。
    中华人民共和国对世界和平事业和亚非团结事业的贡献是具有历史意义的。不管什么时候，只要世界和平受到威胁，中华人民共和国就总是站在保卫这个事业的最前列。我们以自豪的心情回忆起，中印两国一起，在它们签订的著名的潘查希拉协定中，具体地表达出和平共处的原则。万隆精神也大大归功于这两个国家的合作。拥有十亿人民的中华人民共和国和印度这两个国家之间的友好和合作，本身就成为争取和平和自由的一股伟大力量。
    但是，我们觉察到：中印之间的友好关系最近不幸地紧张起来。这样一种友好关系，不仅对两国人民，而且对亚非各国人民，都是必不可少的。美国及其他帝国主义者正极力利用这种令人不愉快的局势来进一步达到他们那罪恶的目的。但我们深信，不管目前存在着什么分歧，这些分歧无疑将会得到消除，而中印之间的友谊必将继续服务于人类的事业。在这两个国家的关系上，没有什么问题根据五项原则的精神、通过友好的协商和谈判而不能解决的。过去我们有两千年和睦关系和文化交流；目前我们又面临着推进民族解放的历史进程和维护世界和平这一共同任务。
    中国人民业已取得了伟大的、划时代的成就。正当你们获得胜利十周年之际，我们希望你们获得更伟大的成就。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    从事社会主义建设、伟大的中国人民万岁！
  中国共产党及以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会万岁！
    中印两国之间的友谊万岁！
    亚非团结和世界和平万岁！
  　1959年9月30日
