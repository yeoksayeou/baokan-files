Kick Away Right-leaning Sentiments and Stride Towards the Highest Peak
Gansu Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting Calls on People of the Province to Complete Various Production Targets Ahead of Schedule

(This newspaper reports) The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held its eleventh enlarged meeting from August 21 to September 24, conveying the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. After careful study and discussion, the comrades present received a profound Marxist-Leninist ideological education, further recognizing the great historical significance of the Eighth Plenary Session and unanimously and warmly supporting the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session. Based on this spirit, they reviewed the implementation of the 1959 national economic plan and fully discussed the current economic situation. They conducted a serious criticism of right-leaning thoughts and launched a struggle against individual right-leaning opportunists. The meeting adopted decisions on implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session and the resolutions of the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, as well as instructions on opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and further developing the campaign to increase production and practice economy. It put forward the task of fighting a major battle in the fourth quarter to complete and overfulfill the main industrial production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year and striving for an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

The meeting held that in 1958, the people of Gansu Province, like the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, unswervingly implemented the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," and achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward and the people's commune system, achieving brilliant achievements on all fronts of socialist construction. In 1959, the Party led the masses to continue the leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. All sectors of the national economy are developing rapidly, and the situation is very good. The total industrial output value completed from January to August this year increased by 93.5% compared with the same period last year, and the output of major products increased significantly compared with the same period last year. Coal increased by 218%, crude oil increased by 54%, power generation increased by 208%, woolen textiles increased by 39%, machine-made paper increased by 282%, and the variety of machinery and light industry increased significantly. Last year, not a ton of steel was produced in the first half of the year, but more than 20,000 tons of iron have been produced in the first half of this year, and it has developed from "small indigenous groups" to "small modern groups." The total investment completed in capital construction from January to August increased by 15.3% compared with the same period last year, and more than 100 projects have been put into production. In terms of transportation, the volume of freight completed in the first eight months of this year increased by 30.6% compared with the same period last year. Although some areas suffered relatively serious hail and flood disasters in agriculture, thanks to the superiority of the people's commune system, natural disasters were overcome, and the output was still higher than last year. The total output of summer crops was 5.4 billion jin, an increase of 12% over 1958, of which wheat was 4 billion jin, an increase of 20% over last year, and autumn crops are generally growing well. Therefore, this year is still a situation of continued leap forward. The total value of commodity sales from January to August this year increased by 40.7% compared with the same period last year, and the entire provincial market presents a prosperous scene.

The meeting, based on the verified statistical figures of the national economy in 1958 and the production development this year, re-examined and adjusted the main production targets of the 1959 national economic plan. In 1958, grain and cotton achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. After re-verification, the total grain output was 12 billion jin, an increase of 41% over 1957, and the total cotton output was 240,000 dan, an increase of 42.7% over 1957. Obviously, this is a particularly large leap forward. The main production targets of the 1959 national economic plan were adjusted on this basis. After the adjustment, the total industrial output value was 2 billion yuan, of which the total output value of local industries was 1.28 billion yuan. The output of steel was 10,000 tons, the output of iron was 50,000 tons, and the output of raw coal was 6.5 million tons. The output of grain was 12.6 billion jin, and the output of cotton was 270,000 dan. The meeting pointed out that the adjusted 1959 national economic plan is still a plan for continued leap forward. Taking steel and iron as an example, last year included both indigenous steel and indigenous iron, but this year it is purely modern iron. After the completion of this year's planned tasks, the target of 1.06 billion yuan for the total output value of local industries in 1962 stipulated in the province's Second Five-Year Plan can be overfulfilled by 20% ahead of schedule. The main products such as pig iron, raw coal, cement, timber transported out of the province, water pumps, auto parts, agricultural machinery, cigarettes, and edible vegetable oil can all be completed ahead of schedule in 1959, overfulfilling the tasks stipulated for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan.

The meeting firmly believes that as long as the comrades of the whole Party are united, adhere to putting politics in command, and fully mobilize the masses, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan. What must be paid serious attention to by all comrades of the Party at present is the right-leaning thinking existing among some cadres, which is the main danger at present and a serious obstacle to our leap forward road. Their right-leaning opportunist activities have, for a period of time, caused serious losses to practical work. In June, July and early August, industrial production declined. The total industrial output value in July decreased by 5% compared with the same period last year, the fiscal revenue in July decreased by 10.6% compared with June, the purchase of local industrial products in July decreased by 19.31% compared with June, and the purchase of foreign trade materials in July decreased by 48.2% compared with June. Agricultural production targets fell again and again, and field management was greatly relaxed. This formed a saddle shape this year: rising before May, declining in June, July and early August, and rising rapidly after mid-August. According to the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting conducted a serious struggle against right-leaning opportunists. It profoundly pointed out that the activities of right-leaning opportunists are a reflection of the class struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat and against the socialist cause. They attempted to transform the Party and society according to the bourgeois outlook, so as to obstruct and undermine the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting adopted a method of combining meetings inside and outside the meeting and combining the top and bottom, and promptly smashed the right-leaning opportunists' frenzied attack on the Party, powerfully promoting a new upsurge of opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and developing the campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the province. In the short period since the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, the figures for completing production plans have risen sharply. Industrial output value in early September increased by 134% compared with early August, and capital construction in early September increased by 48.4% compared with early August. Fiscal revenue in early September increased by 100.63% compared with early August, the total amount of local industrial products and agricultural and sideline products purchased in early September increased by 112% compared with early August, and the total sales increased by 66%. As of mid-September, the amount of summer grain purchased and stored increased by 187.16% compared with the same period last year, and the amount of oil purchased and stored in mid-September tripled compared with the same period last year. The mass movement for a major battle on the agricultural front is booming, production increase targets are gradually increasing, and various measures are being strengthened universally. There has been a rapid development of livestock and poultry and large livestock, and the rural areas of the province are presenting a scene of thriving livestock and abundant crops. Other fronts are also full of vitality, with leap forward after leap forward. A vigorous and solid campaign to increase production and practice economy is developing in depth.

There are only three months left in 1959. In order to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan, the meeting requires all regions and departments to take opposing right-leaning tendencies as the key, boost revolutionary morale, continue to deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy without exception, and grasp the campaign tightly, fiercely, deeply, and thoroughly. The practice of Gansu has repeatedly proved that "to revolutionize nature, we must first revolutionize our thinking," and every victory of socialist revolution and construction has been achieved after repeatedly defeating right-leaning thinking. Gansu is a poorer and blanker area, and the people's enthusiasm to change the poor and blank face is higher, the enthusiasm is greater, and the pace of the leap forward is faster. In this way, the struggle between old and new ideas is more acute and prominent. Due to the large differences between regions, there are both favorable and unfavorable aspects, which requires people to give greater play to their subjective initiative. Now it is also shouldering the historical task of rapidly building a new industrial base for the motherland. The construction task is very large, but the foundation is weak, and there are many difficulties in the progress. Our Party and those with right-leaning opportunist thinking have completely different views on this situation, and their attitudes towards the difficulties arising in development are naturally different. Our Party has always led the broad masses of people to overcome all difficulties and leap forward with an unstoppable momentum. People with right-leaning thinking often waver in the face of difficulties, or even be frightened by difficulties. A small number of right-leaning opportunists take the opportunity to spread pessimistic views and obstruct and undermine the socialist cause of the people. The meeting pointed out that we are facing the great historical task of fighting the earth and building a strong country. If we do not overcome the right-leaning opportunist thinking that hinders our progress, and if we do not smash the right-leaning opportunists' frenzied attack on the Party, our socialist construction cause will not be able to move forward smoothly. This struggle is inevitable, and all comrades of the Party must resolutely and actively participate in this struggle and win this struggle.

The meeting requested that in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the industrial sector should strive to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan, and strive to complete and overfulfill the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year. To this end, the entire industrial front of the province must strengthen enterprise management and continue to promote a new upsurge in the campaign to increase production and practice economy with high quality, high yield, low cost, and safe production as the main contents. Grasp the main products, especially steel, steel, coal, timber, cement, chemical raw materials and oil production, complete and overfulfill the plan according to quality, quantity, variety, day, ten days, and month. For newly built local industries, especially county-run industries and commune industries, we must consolidate and improve them and develop them appropriately. Capital construction should focus on key projects, ensure quality, speed up progress, and do a good job in equipment matching to strive for early production. At the same time, we must vigorously save steel, timber and cement. Transportation should focus on the professional transportation teams of people's communes and production teams to carry out a mass movement of short-distance transportation. Vigorously tap the potential of railway and highway transportation. On the agricultural front, we must strive for an all-round bumper harvest this year and prepare for a greater harvest next year. At present, we must focus on the "three autumns" work, focus on the development of animal husbandry, focus on autumn fattening, focus on silage and dry grass storage, and prepare for livestock's wintering and autumn and winter epidemic prevention. In addition, we must run rural welfare undertakings well, and do our best to run canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly. And make preparations to immediately launch a mass water conservancy repair movement after the autumn harvest is basically over. Mobilize 1.5 million to 2 million people to complete water conservancy projects that can produce benefits next year, increasing the actual irrigated area by 5 million to 7 million mu. The meeting called on all members of the rural people's communes to open up various production avenues on the basis of completing the original production plan, and vigorously increase production, such as collecting wild plants, hunting wild animals, mining minerals, participating in short-distance transportation, rationally developing team-run industries, and vigorously engaging in sideline production, so as to increase the average income per person by six to ten yuan. In terms of commerce, we must vigorously organize the supply of means of production and means of livelihood in urban and rural areas, as well as the purchase of agricultural products, light industrial products, and handicraft products, conscientiously improve warehouse management, rationally allocate materials, and effectively cooperate between industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation to better serve production and the lives of the masses. Scientific, cultural, educational and health undertakings should all make more outstanding achievements under the light of the general line.

The Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting requested party committees at all levels to conscientiously convey and implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and the resolutions of the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, further carry out the struggle against right-leaning tendencies, and set off a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, unite closely, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, improve the level of political ideology, and firmly establish the proletariat's position and viewpoint, and stand firm in the waves of revolution. Conscientiously absorb and carry forward the rich experience in the Great Leap Forward last year, and comprehensively consider and properly arrange all work. Work hard and cleverly, forge ahead courageously, and strive to complete and overfulfill the main industrial production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year and strive for an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

　　踢开右倾情绪阔步跨上最高峰
    甘肃省委扩大会议号召全省人民提前完成各项生产指标
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委员会于8月21日至9月24日举行第十一次扩大会议，传达了中共八届八中全会的精神。到会同志经过认真的学习和讨论，受到了一次深刻的马克思列宁主义思想教育，进一步认识到八届八中全会的重大历史意义，一致热烈拥护八届八中全会的决议。并据此精神检查了1959年国民经济计划的执行情况，充分地讨论了当前的经济形势。对右倾思想进行了严肃的批判、对个别右倾机会主义分子展开了斗争。会议通过了关于贯彻执行八届八中全会决议和省委扩大会议决议的决定，以及关于反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展增产节约运动的指示。向全省人民提出了大战四季度，为今年内提前完成和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要工业生产指标，争取今年农业全面大丰收的斗争任务。
    会议认为1958年甘肃省人民和全国人民一样，在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，坚定不移地贯彻执行了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，实现了史无前例的大跃进和人民公社化，在社会主义建设的各个战线上，取得了辉煌的成就。1959年党领导人民群众在1958年大跃进的基础上，继续跃进。国民经济各部门都在飞跃发展，形势十分良好。今年1至8月份完成的工业总产值比去年同期增长93.5％，主要产品的产量比去年同期都有很大的增长。煤炭增长218％，原油增长54％，发电量增长208％，粗纺毛织品增长39％，机制纸增长282％，机械、轻工业的花色品种都增加了很多。去年上半年还不生产一吨钢铁，今年上半年已生产二万多吨铁，并且由“小土群”发展到“小洋群”。基本建设1至8月份完成的投资总额，比去年同期增长15.3％，已有一百多个项目投入生产。交通运输方面，今年头八个月完成的货运量比去年同期增长30.6％。农业方面虽然部分地区遭受了比较严重的雹、洪等灾害，但由于发挥了人民公社化的优越性，战胜了自然灾害，产量仍比去年高。夏田总产量五十四亿斤，比1958年增产12％，其中小麦四十亿斤，比去年增产20％，秋田普遍生长良好。所以今年仍是继续跃进的形势。商品销售总值今年1至8月份比去年同期增长40.7％，全省市场呈现一片繁荣景象。
    会议根据1958年国民经济核实后的统计数字和今年生产发展的情况，重新审查和调整了1959年的国民经济计划的主要生产指标。1958年的粮棉获得空前大丰收，经重新核定，粮食总产量为一百二十亿斤，比1957年增长41％，棉花总产量为二十四万担，比1957年增长42.7％。显然，这是特大的跃进。1959年的国民经济计划的主要生产指标，在此基础上进行了调整。调整后工业生产总产值为二十亿元，其中地方工业总产值为十二亿八千万元。钢的产量为一万吨，铁的产量为五万吨，原煤的产量为六百五十万吨。粮食的产量为一百二十六亿斤，棉花的产量为二十七万担。会议指出：调整后的1959年国民经济计划，仍然是继续跃进的计划。以钢和铁来说，去年包括土钢土铁，今年纯系洋铁，而今年的计划任务完成后，全省第二个五年计划规定的1962年地方工业总产值十亿六千万元的指标，就可以超额20％提前完成。主要产品如生铁、原煤、水泥、运出木材、水泵、汽车配件、农业机械、卷烟和食用植物油等均可提前于1959年超额完成第二个五年计划规定的1962年的任务。
    会议深信：只要全党同志团结一致，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，完成和超额完成1959年的国民经济计划是完全有可能的。当前必须引起全党同志严重注意的，是某些干部中存在的右倾思想，这是当前的主要危险，是我们跃进道路上的严重障碍。他们的这种右倾机会主义的活动，已经在一个时期内，给实际工作造成了严重损失。在6、7两月和8月上旬，工业生产下降。7月份工业总产值，比去年同期下降5％，财政收入7月份比6月份下降10.6％，地方工业产品收购7月份比6月份下降19.31％，外贸物资收购7月份比6月份下降48.2％。农业生产指标一落再落，田间管理大大放松。这样就形成今年以来5月以前上升，6、7两月和8月上旬下降，8月中旬以后迅速回升的马鞍形。省委扩大会议根据中共八届八中全会决议精神，对右倾机会主义分子进行了严肃的斗争。深刻地指出右倾机会主义分子的活动，是资产阶级反对无产阶级、反对社会主义事业的阶级斗争的反映。他们企图按照资产阶级的面貌来改造党、改造社会，达到阻挠和破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的目的。省委扩大会议采取会内会外结合、上下结合的方法，及时地粉碎了右倾机会主义分子向党的猖狂进攻，有力地推动了全省反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的新高潮。在反右倾斗争以来的短时期内生产计划完成数字即直线上升。工业产值9月上旬比8月上旬增长134％，基本建设9月上旬比8月上旬增长48.4％。财政收入9月上旬比8月上旬增长100.63％，地方工业产品和农副产品的收购总额9月上旬比8月上旬增长112％，销售总额增长66％。夏粮征购入库量截至9月中旬比去年同期增长187.16％，油料入库数9月中旬比去年同期增长三倍。农业线上大战生产的群众运动蓬勃展开，增产指标逐步提高，各项措施普遍加强。家畜家禽和大牲畜有了迅速的发展，全省农村呈现一片六畜兴旺、五谷丰登的景象。其他战线也都是生气勃勃，跃进再跃进。一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的增产节约运动正在向纵深发展。
    1959年只剩三个月了，为完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划，会议要求各地区各部门都必须毫无例外地以反右倾为纲，大鼓革命干劲，继续深入地开展增产节约运动，把运动抓紧、抓狠、抓深、抓透。甘肃的实践已经反复地证明：“要革自然的命，必先革思想的命”，社会主义革命和建设的每一个胜利，都是反复地战胜了右倾思想以后取得的。甘肃是一个更穷更白的地区，人民群众要求改变穷白面貌的积极性更高，干劲更大，跃进的步子走得更快，这样，新旧思想的斗争也就更加尖锐和突出，由于地区之间差别性大，有它有利的一面，也有不利的一面，这就要求人们发挥更大的主观能动性。现在又担负着迅速建成祖国新的工业基地的历史任务，建设任务很大，但基础薄弱，前进中的困难较多。对于这种情况我们党和有右倾机会主义思想的人，看法完全不同，对待在发展中产生的困难的态度自然也是两样。我们党向来是领导广大人民群众，以锐不可当之势，排除一切困难，飞跃前进。有右倾思想的人则往往在困难面前发生动摇，甚至被困难吓倒，少数右倾机会主义分子则借机散布悲观论调，对人民群众的社会主义事业进行阻挠和破坏。会议指出：我们正在面临着向地球开战，建立强国的伟大历史任务，不克服阻挠我们前进的右倾机会主义思想，不粉碎右倾机会主义分子向党的猖狂进攻，我们的社会主义建设事业就不可能顺利前进。这种斗争是不可避免的，全党同志都必须坚决地积极参加这个斗争，并取得这个斗争的胜利。
    会议要求在增产节约运动中，工业方面要力争完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划，为在今年内提前和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。为此，全省工业战线，必须加强企业管理，继续推进以优质、高产、低成本和安全生产为主要内容的增产节约运动新高潮。抓好主要产品，特别要抓紧钢铁、钢材、煤炭、木材、水泥、化工原料和石油的生产，按质、按量、按品种、按日、按旬、按月完成和超额完成计划。对新建地方工业特别是县办工业和公社工业，要抓紧巩固提高，并适当地加以发展。基本建设要抓紧重点工程项目，保证质量、加快进度，并且做好设备配套工作，争取及早投入生产。同时要大力节约钢材、木材和水泥。交通运输要抓紧人民公社和生产队的专业运输队，开展一个短途运输的群众运动。大力发挥铁路和公路运输的潜力。农业战线上要争取今年全面大丰收和准备明年更大的丰收。目前必须抓紧“三秋”工作，抓紧发展畜牧业，抓好秋膘，抓好青贮和干贮草，作好牲畜的越冬准备和秋冬防疫工作。此外，要办好农村福利事业，全力办好食堂、托儿所和敬老院。并且作好准备，在秋收基本结束后，立即开展一个群众性的大修水利运动。动员一百五十万至两百万人，突击完成明年能够发挥效益的水利工程，增加实灌面积五百至七百万亩。会议号召农村人民公社的全体社员，在完成原订生产计划的基础上，开辟多种生产门路，大力增产，如采集野生植物，猎取野生动物，采挖矿产，参加短途运输，合理发展队办工业，大搞副业生产等等，达到按人口平均计算每人增加收入六元至十元。商业方面要大力组织城乡生产资料和生活资料的供应以及农产品、轻工业品、手工业品的收购，认真改善仓库管理，合理调拨物资，切实作好工农商交之间的协作配合，更好地为生产和群众生活服务。科学文化教育卫生事业都应当在总路线的照耀下作出更出色的成绩来。
    省委扩大会议要求各级党委认真传达和贯彻执行中共八届八中全会和省委扩大会议的决议，进一步开展反右倾斗争，掀起增产节约的新高潮，在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，紧密地团结一致，加强马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的学习，提高政治思想水平，坚定无产阶级的立场、观点，在革命的风浪中站稳脚跟。认真吸取和发扬去年大跃进中的丰富经验，对一切工作都应当统筹兼顾，妥善安排。大干巧干，奋勇前进，为今年内提前完成和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要工业生产指标，争取今年农业全面大丰收而奋斗。
