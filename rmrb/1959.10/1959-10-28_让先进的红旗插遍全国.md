    Let the Advanced Red Flag Be Planted Throughout the Country

    We are in an era of soaring communist spirit. The more than six thousand representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers sitting in the Great Hall of the People, and the nearly three hundred thousand advanced collectives and more than three million advanced producers they represent, are representatives of this new era and new style. They have used their newly created technologies and experiences to build countless "bridges," allowing our country to move from the old production level to a new one. They also take the initiative to lead others across the "bridge," and enthusiastically help others catch up with and surpass their own levels. As a result, a vigorous mass great leap forward situation has emerged in our country.

    Why do they strive to always maintain their advanced status and happily and selflessly help others advance? This is because they all have a common goal and ideal—to build a socialist motherland and move towards a communist paradise. To realize this beautiful ideal, we must thoroughly overthrow bourgeois individualism and use the method of mutual assistance and mutual improvement to tap the power of the entire people. "A single flower does not make spring, and a single tree does not make a forest." "One person's advancement is only a single shot, while everyone's advancement can move mountains and overturn seas." The wheels of history must be driven by hundreds of millions of giant hands to move forward rapidly. The sparks of fire are precious because they can turn into a raging prairie fire. Only when the sparks of fire become a prairie fire can they burn away the thorns on the ground, drive away wild beasts, and then sow seeds, plant trees, and let the land serve mankind. Advanced producers are precious because their newly created technologies and experiences can be mastered by millions of people. Only when the majority have mastered new technologies and new experiences, and have reached the level of advanced producers, can the production level of the entire society be improved by one step, and history can move forward. Therefore, they do not regard their inventions as private property, but regard them as the wealth of the people of the whole country. They are not satisfied with the advancement of their own units and individuals, but want to actively help other units and other people to advance together. In order to help others, they never care about personal reputation or gain, and take on difficulties.

    Of course, no matter who it is, the road must be walked by oneself, the upstream must be fought for by oneself, and advancement must be won by oneself. If one is content to be downstream and does not strive for success, no matter how much others help, one will not be able to enter the ranks of the advanced. But when a person is working hard to swim upstream, or is temporarily lagging behind due to improper methods or other reasons, someone pulls them in front or pushes them from behind, the speed of progress will be accelerated. The Shanghai Pioneer Motor Factory encountered some difficulties in technology and raw material supply in the competition with the same industry. After receiving assistance from the workers of the Shanghai Motor Factory, it successfully completed the state plan. A fine yarn team in Northwest State Cotton Factory No. 1, with the help of Zhao Mengtao, a national labor model, everyone became an advanced producer. If the workers of the Pioneer Motor Factory did not strive for progress, could the assistance of the Shanghai Motor Factory have such great power? If the other comrades in Zhao Mengtao's team did not strive for progress, could they all become advanced producers with her help? Therefore, the fact that the advanced help the backward, and the backward become the advanced, not only shows the power of advanced help, but also shows that the people and units being helped themselves have the conditions to achieve advancement, and have the conditions to transform from backwardness to advancement. Their "backwardness" is only a temporary phenomenon. The fact that the communist style of the advanced helping the backward can be widely promoted in the labor competition also shows that the broad masses of workers in our country have the determination and courage to strive for progress, and all have the desire to do a good job in production and construction. This is a sign of our nation's prosperity, and a sign that the socialist construction cause has unlimited prospects.

    The current goal of the Chinese people is to build a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not too long period of time. We must strive to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years. We must realize the technical transformation of agriculture as soon as possible. On the road of continuous progress, the Party places great hopes on advanced units and advanced producers. Advanced units and advanced producers must always listen to the Party's words, under the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, leap forward again and again, and constantly expand the ranks of advanced units and advanced producers, so that advanced red flowers bloom in every factory, every workshop, every construction site, every team! Let the advanced red flag be planted all over the country!

    让先进的红旗插遍全国
    王朴
    我们正处在一个共产主义风格高涨的时代。坐在人民大会堂的六千多先进集体和先进生产者代表，以及他们所代表的近三十万个先进集体和三百多万名先进生产者，就是这新时代和新风格的代表。他们用自己所创造的新技术、新经验搭了无数座“桥梁”，让我们国家从旧的生产水平迈向新的生产水平，他们还主动地带动别人过“桥”，热心地帮助别人赶上和超过自己的水平。于是，在我国就涌现了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的大跃进的局面。
    为什么他们努力地使自己永远保持先进和愉快地无私地帮助别人先进呢？这是因为他们都有一个共同的目标和理想——建成社会主义的祖国和走向共产主义的乐园。而要实现这个美丽的理想，就必须彻底打倒资产阶级个人主义的思想，用共同帮助、互相提高的办法挖掘全民的力量。“独花不成春，独木不成林”，“一人先进只有单枪匹马，众人先进才能移山倒海”，历史的车轮要亿万双巨手推动，才能迅速前进。星星之火所以宝贵，是因为它们能够变成熊熊的燎原大火。只有当星星之火变成了燎原的大火，才能烧掉地上的荆棘，驱走野兽，然后撒上种子，种上树木，让土地为人类服务。先进生产者所以宝贵，是因为他们所创造的新技术、新经验，能够为千百万人所掌握。只有大多数都掌握了新技术、新经验，都达到了先进生产者的水平，整个社会的生产水平才能提高一步，历史才能前进。因此他们不把自己的创造发明据为私有，而把它们看做全国人民的财富。他们不满足于自己单位、个人的先进，而要主动地帮助别的单位、别的人一起先进。为了帮助别人，从不计较个人的名誉得失，把困难担当起来。
    当然，不论什么人，路总得自己走，上游要自己去争，先进要自己去夺。甘居下游，不争气，别人再帮忙，也是走不进先进行列的。但是当一个人正在努力向上游游去，或者由于方法不对头，或者由于别的什么原因，暂时落在后面的时候，有人在前面拉一拉，或者在后面推一推，前进的速度就加快了。上海先锋电机厂在同行业的竞赛中，在技术上和原料供应上遇到些困难，得到了上海电机厂职工的支援以后，就顺利地完成了国家计划。西北国棉一厂一个细纱小组，在全国劳动模范赵梦桃的帮助下，人人都成为先进生产者。如果先锋电机厂的职工同志不力争上游，上海电机厂的支援能有这么大威力吗？如果赵梦桃所在的小组的其他同志不力争上游，靠她的帮助就能人人都变成先进生产者吗？所以先进一帮助落后，落后就变为先进，这不只说明先进帮助的力量，同时也说明被帮助的人和单位，本身就具有达到先进的条件，具有从落后向先进转化的条件。他们处于“落后”，只是暂时的现象。在劳动竞赛中，先进帮助落后的共产主义风格能够得到广泛的发扬，也正说明了我国广大职工群众都有力争上游的决心和勇气，都有一心搞好生产和建设的愿望。这是我们民族兴旺的标志，是社会主义建设事业前途无量的标志。
    我国人民当前的目标，是在一个不太长的时间内建成一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家。我们要争取在十年左右在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国。我们要尽快地实现农业的技术改造。在继续前进的道路上，党对先进单位和先进生产者寄予极大的希望。先进单位和先进生产者必须永远听党的话，在毛泽东思想的红旗下，跃进再跃进，不断扩大先进单位和先进生产者的队伍，让先进的红花开遍每一个厂、每一个车间、每一个工地、每一个小组！让先进的红旗插遍全国！
