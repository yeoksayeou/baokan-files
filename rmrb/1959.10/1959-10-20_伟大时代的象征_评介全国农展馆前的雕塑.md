　　A Symbol of the Great Era
　　——An Appreciation of the Sculptures in Front of the National Agricultural Exhibition Center
　　Song He

    The two groups of sculptures erected on the left and right of the National Agricultural Exhibition Center's plaza, "Long Live the People's Commune Combining Workers, Peasants, Merchants, Students, and Soldiers" and "Long Live the People's Commune with Comprehensive Development of Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fishery" (pictured above) are two excellent works.

    These two groups of sculptures, using the unique artistic language of sculpture, praise the face of our great era and depict the soaring enthusiasm and the great spirit of moving mountains and seas of our people in building socialism. When we browse around these two sculptures, it is as if we are once again immersed in the ranks of the booming mass movement of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization, and it is as if we are hearing the exciting sound of gongs and drums and seeing the people's determination to move firmly towards socialism.

    These two statues, eight meters high, five point two meters long, and four point eight meters wide, were successfully created by ten teachers and students from the Sculpture Department of the Northeast Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts after more than two months of hard work. The works depict eighteen heroic figures, each one and a half times the size of a real person, nine in each group. In the middle of each group, two galloping horses are sculpted, one carrying a large drum with national characteristics and symbolizing celebration, and the other carrying a "treasure pot" symbolizing a happy harvest. Behind the drum stands a spirited and energetic drummer, and behind the "treasure pot" is sculpted a simple, beautiful, and vibrant rural girl. They hold drumsticks and cymbals in their hands, showing the dynamic motion of excited and powerful striking, seeming to send people bursts of rhythmic and inspiring gongs and drums.

    Around the horses, each group of statues also surrounds eight laborers with different clothes, ages, genders, and movements. They are all radiant and high-spirited, symbolizing the vigorous development of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers and the comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in our country's rural areas. The former celebrates the establishment of the People's Commune, and the latter symbolizes the lively scene of a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery.

    From the works, it is not difficult for people to see that, in the entire conception and shaping process, whether it is the choice of theme, the overall layout, the characterization of the characters, or the interrelationship between the two sculptures, the authors obviously have their own originality and spirit of bold experimentation. And they have also achieved better coordination and unity with the tall buildings of the Agricultural Exhibition Center. The outdoor decorative sculpture that matches the architecture itself requires the clarity and fullness of the outer contour, the emphasis on the undulation of the form, and the high degree of conciseness in the processing techniques, etc. And the sculptors in the Northeast are consciously playing this unique artistic function in these two statues.

    What is even more noteworthy is the sculptors' achievements in learning from traditional national sculpture, which can be seen from the conception, composition, and treatment. For example, drums and cymbals are musical instruments used by our people to express joyful emotions, and the "treasure pot" is also a legend that people have long known as the treasure of treasures in mythology. The clever sculptors have precisely grasped this form that the people love to see and hear and have made appropriate emphasis in their works, which adds a lot of festive and joyful atmosphere to the works. In the expression, they also inherited the thick, simple, and powerful characteristics of the motherland's sculpture, that bold exaggeration and refining technique, and that spirit of proceeding from the requirements of the theme. Look at the young farmer holding up the drumstick, because the author absorbed the advantages of the ancient Vajra giants, and did not "realistically describe" and be a prisoner of the model, so he is no longer an ordinary farmer, but a giant who stands upright and reverses the universe. He is a symbol of the 600 million working people and also a symbol of strength. For example, the horse's clothing in the statue is treated with relief sculpture to avoid destroying the overall shape, making the overall sense of the statue very strong.

    Of course, since most of the authors are still young and their artistic practice experience is not enough, it is inevitable that there are still some shortcomings, such as the overall structure, the shaping of clothing, and the characterization of some characters. However, these shortcomings do not detract from the main achievements of the work.

    On the sculpture front, following the Great Leap Forward in 1958, China's sculpture creation has shown a prosperous scene. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, sculptors across the country, full of energy and breaking superstitions, have begun to create many magnificent, fresh in style, and profound in artistic conception sculptures, and these two works are among them.

　　伟大时代的象征
　　——评介全国农展馆前的雕塑
　　菘河
    树立在全国农业展览馆广场左右的两座群雕，“工农商学兵相结合的人民公社万岁”和“农林牧副渔全面发展的人民公社万岁”（上图）是两件好作品。
    这两座群雕，以雕塑独特的艺术语言，歌颂了我们伟大时代的面貌，刻划出了我国人民在建设社会主义中的冲天干劲和移山造海的伟大气魄。当我们浏览在这两座雕塑周围时，仿佛又投身于大跃进，人民公社化轰轰烈烈群众运动的行列，仿佛又听到了那动人心弦的锣鼓声，看到了人民坚决走向社会主义的意志。
    这两座高八米，长五点二米，宽四点八米的雕像，是东北鲁迅美术学院雕塑系十名师生经过短短两个多月的辛勤劳动而创作成功的。作品里塑造了十八个比真人大一倍的英雄人物，每座九人，每座中间又分别塑造了两匹阔步前进的骏马，马上一边安放着一个具有民族特色和象征着欢庆的大鼓，另一个则驮着一个象征幸福丰收的“聚宝盆”。大鼓的后面站立着一个意志奋发，精神充沛的鼓手，“聚宝盆”后面塑造了一个纯朴、健美，充满着青春活力的农村姑娘，他们双手分持着鼓锤和大钹，现出兴奋有力击打的动势，似乎给人们送来了一阵阵富有节奏的振奋人心的锣鼓声。
    在马的四周每座雕像还分别围绕着八名衣饰、年龄、性别、动作不同的劳动者，他们个个精神焕发，意志昂扬，象征着在我国农村蓬勃发展的工农商学兵和农林牧副渔的全面跃进，前者是欢庆人民公社的成立，后者是象征农林牧副渔全面大丰收热闹的情景。
    从作品中人们不难看出，作者在整个构思及塑造过程中，无论主题的选择，整体的布局，人物的刻划，以及两座雕像的互应关系，显然，都有自己的独创性和大胆尝试的精神。并且也较好地和农展馆那高大的建筑物取得了协调和统一。配合建筑的室外装饰雕塑本身，要求它外形边线的清晰、饱满和在形体上起伏的强调，在处理手法上的高度简练等等。而东北的雕塑家们在这两座雕像中，正是有意识地发挥这一特有的艺术功能。
    更值得注意的是雕塑家们在学习民族传统雕塑方面的成就，这一点不论从构思和构图以及处理上都可以看到。例如鼓和钹是我国人民用来抒发欢乐情感的乐器，“聚宝盆”也是人们早已熟知神话里宝中之宝的传说，而聪明的雕塑家正是紧紧抓住了这一人民喜闻乐见的形式，在作品中作了适当的强调，使得作品增添了不少喜庆欢乐的气氛。在表现上，他们又继承了祖国雕塑的那种浑厚、朴实、有力的特色，那种大胆的夸张和提炼的手法，那种一切从主题要求出发的精神。你看，那个高举鼓锤的青年农民，由于作者吸取古代金刚力士的优点，不是“如实的描写”地去作模特儿的俘虏，所以他已经不是一个普通的农民，而是一个顶天立地，扭转乾坤的巨人，他是六亿劳动人民的象征，也是力量的象征。又如雕像中的马衣，为了避免破坏整个的造型，而采用了浮雕的处理，使得雕像整体感非常强烈。
    当然，由于作者们绝大部分还是些青年，他们艺术实践经验还不够，因此就难免还存在一些缺点，如整个的结构、衣饰的塑造和有些人物的形象刻划等。但，这些缺点并没有损伤作品的主要成就。
    在雕塑战线上，继1958年大跃进，我国的雕塑创作呈现出了一片繁荣的景象，全国雕塑工作者在党的总路线光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲，破除迷信，已开始创作出了不少雄伟壮丽，风格清新，意境较深的雕塑品，这两件作品就是其中之一。
