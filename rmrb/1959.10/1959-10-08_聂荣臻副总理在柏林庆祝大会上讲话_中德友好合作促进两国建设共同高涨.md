Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th -- The following is the full text of the speech given by Nie Rongzhen, head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Vice Premier of the State Council, at the celebration rally marking the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic on the afternoon of the 6th: Dear comrades and friends!

    As the German Democratic Republic joyously celebrates the tenth anniversary of its founding, we have come to your capital, Berlin, entrusted by the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, bringing with us the regards of 650 million people. China and Germany are both members of the socialist family and brothers born in the same year and month. We just celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing with the Party and Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic. Now, our delegation is in Berlin again, joining the people of the German Democratic Republic in celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. From here, we once again see the unity, solidarity, prosperity and strength of the socialist camp, and we are very excited and happy.

    During the Second World War, the Soviet army heroically destroyed Hitler's fascist reactionary forces, enabling the German working class and the German people's struggle for liberation to achieve a historic turning point. Ten years ago, the first worker-peasant state in German history – the German Democratic Republic – was established. Under the leadership of Socialist Unity party of Germany and the Government of the German Democratic Republic, the people of the German Democratic Republic have advanced along the path of Marxism-Leninism and have achieved brilliant accomplishments in all aspects. This year, the construction of a magnificent seven-year plan has begun. The realization of this plan will be a glorious victory for the German Democratic Republic in building socialism, and will also make a significant contribution to the peaceful competition between the socialist camp and capitalist countries.

    The German Democratic Republic is located on the western forefront of the socialist camp. Over the past decade, it has made significant progress in the struggle against German militarism, for German reunification, and for the defense of European and world peace. Without the participation of the German Democratic Republic, the resolution of the German question is impossible. The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the West German Adenauer reactionary clique to isolate the German Democratic Republic will never succeed. We, the Chinese people, will always stand with you, and the Chinese people celebrate every victory you have achieved in this struggle with unparalleled excitement!

    Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, the Chinese people have made decisive victories in the socialist revolution and great achievements in socialist construction through ten years of hard work. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, our country's socialist construction has leaped forward at an unprecedented speed, and the cause of the people's communes is like the rising sun, radiating infinite light.

    Over the past decade, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Germany, built on the basis of proletarian internationalist principles, have been comprehensively developed, greatly promoting the common upsurge of the socialist construction of our two countries. The German Democratic Republic has consistently and powerfully supported our country's socialist construction. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic have also consistently given strong support to our country's struggle against U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory of Taiwan. We deeply cherish the noble friendship between the Chinese and German peoples and are willing to make unremitting efforts to further develop the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

    The international situation is favorable to us. The forces of peace and socialism have surpassed the forces of imperialist war. The recent successful visit of Comrade Khrushchev to the United States has extremely significant meaning for easing international tensions and for the cause of world peace. The wheels of history are unstoppable, and the evil activities of U.S. imperialism and all other imperialists to undermine world peace will inevitably lead to shameful failure. We firmly believe that due to the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the concerted efforts of peace forces worldwide, peace will ultimately prevail over war, and justice will ultimately triumph over aggression.

    Now, please allow me to convey the heartfelt congratulations of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people to you (Vice Premier Nie read out at the meeting the congratulatory message from our Party and state leaders to the Party and state leaders of the German Democratic Republic).

    聂荣臻副总理在柏林庆祝大会上讲话
    中德友好合作促进两国建设共同高涨
    新华社柏林6日电　中国党政代表团团长、中国共产党中央委员会委员、国务院副总理聂荣臻6日下午在德意志民主共和国成立十周年庆祝大会上的讲话全文：亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    在德意志民主共和国欢度建国十周年的日子里，我们受中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民的嘱托，带着六亿五千万人民的心意，来到你们的首都柏林。中德两国都是社会主义大家庭的成员，而且是同年同月诞生的兄弟，我们刚刚在北京和德意志民主共和国的党政代表团一起，欢呼中华人民共和国成立十周年，现在我们代表团又在柏林和德意志民主共和国人民一起参加德意志民主共和国建国十周年庆祝大典。从这里，我们再一次看到了社会主义阵营的团结一致与繁荣强大，我们的心情非常兴奋与愉快。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队英勇地摧毁了希特勒的法西斯反动势力，使德国工人阶级和德意志人民的解放斗争获得了一个历史性的转折。十年前，在德国历史上建立了第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国。德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，沿着马克思列宁主义的道路前进，各方面都取得了辉煌的成就。今年又开始进行了宏伟的七年计划的建设，这个计划的实现，将是德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的光辉胜利，同时对社会主义阵营同资本主义国家的和平竞赛也将作出重大的贡献。
    德意志民主共和国处于社会主义阵营西方的最前线。十年来，在反对德国军国主义、争取德国统一、保卫欧洲和世界和平的斗争中，获得了重大的进展。没有德意志民主共和国参加，德国问题的解决是不可能的。美帝国主义和西德阿登纳反动集团企图孤立德意志民主共和国的阴谋是永远不能得逞的。我们中国人民永远和你们站在一起，中国人民以无比兴奋的心情欢呼你们在这一斗争中所获得的每一个胜利！
    中国人民在中国共产党和中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的正确领导下，经过十年来的努力，取得了社会主义革命决定性的胜利和社会主义建设的巨大成就。特别是从1958年以来，在党的建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的社会主义建设事业以前所未有的高速度向前跃进，人民公社事业正如旭日东升，光芒万丈。
    十年来，中德两国建立在无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的友好合作关系，获得了全面的发展，大大地促进了我们两国的社会主义建设事业的共同高涨。德意志民主共和国一贯有力地支援了我国的社会主义建设。德意志民主共和国政府和人民对我国反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的斗争也一贯给予大力支持。我们十分珍惜中德人民的崇高友谊，并愿为进一步发展两国的兄弟般的友谊和合作而作不懈的努力。
    国际形势对我们是有利的。和平和社会主义力量已经超过了帝国主义战争势力。最近赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国的成功，对缓和国际紧张局势和对世界和平事业具有极其重大的意义。历史的车轮是不可阻挡的，美帝国主义和其他一切帝国主义破坏世界和平的罪恶活动必将招致可耻的失败。我们坚信，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强的团结，全世界和平力量的一致努力，和平终将胜过战争，正义终将压倒侵略。
    现在，请允许我转达中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向你们的衷心的祝贺（聂副总理在会上宣读了我党和国家领导人给德意志民主共和国党和国家领导人的贺电电文）。
