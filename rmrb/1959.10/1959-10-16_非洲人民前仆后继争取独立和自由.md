Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 13th. According to news received here today, Cameroonian nationalists engaged in fierce armed conflicts with French colonialists around the end of September, inflicting significant losses on the French forces.
    The news stated that Cameroonian nationalists killed thirty French soldiers in an ambush at Bafoussam in the Bamileke region; killed sixteen French people in Bangangte, another location in the Bamileke region; killed the French district head in Yabassi, Nkongsamba, in southwestern Cameroon, and seized a large quantity of supplies; killed five French officers and soldiers in Kribi, Kribi district; killed two French district heads in Idenau, in the Sanaga Maritime region; and destroyed forty French military vehicles in the port of Douala.
    Commenting on the situation, a Cameroonian authority here said that this marked an important development in the struggle of Cameroonian nationalists. This person emphasized that the fact that forty French military vehicles were destroyed in one instance in the port of Douala, one of the most important centers of the French forces, proves that the French colonialists do not have the strength to deal with the situation.
    Speaking about the political situation in Cameroon, this person said that recently, in order to improve their precarious position in Cameroon, the French conspired to use a traitor of the Cameroonian People's Union named Mayi Matip to organize a so-called "moderate Cameroonian People's Union government" to oppose the "extremist Cameroonian People's Union." However, this conspiracy was met with fierce criticism from the Cameroonian People's Union and the Cameroonian people, which forced the French to temporarily cancel this plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 14th. The people of Kenya will commemorate "Kenya Day" on October 20, marking this day as one to mourn the more than 30,000 compatriots who sacrificed their lives under British bullets and to declare to the world their indomitable will to demand freedom. This was stated today at a press conference by Anbiso, secretary of the Kenya office of the African Association here. "Kenya Day" was decided by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council in February this year.
    Anbiso said that this day is the anniversary of the day seven years ago when the British colonialists declared a "state of emergency" in Kenya. Through this commemoration, we will mobilize our own strength to carry out another political struggle.
    Reviewing the repressive activities of the British colonialists in Kenya over the past three months, Anbiso said that recently the British colonial authorities refused to register the Kenya Independence Movement Party led by Oginga Odinga: Odinga himself was also persecuted by the colonialists for "giving a speech at a conference without obtaining permission from the authorities."
    In order to intimidate the African people, the British colonial authorities have also assembled an army of more than 3,500 people in the area of northern Kenya where Jomo Kenyatta was exiled.
    Anbiso reiterated that the Kenyan people demand the immediate and unconditional release of Jomo Kenyatta, and they will not accept any resolutions of the Kenyan constitutional round table conference unless Jomo Kenyatta and other people detained for political reasons can freely attend the conference.
    In his speech, Anbiso demanded an end to the "state of emergency" in Kenya, a thorough investigation into the recent extremely cruel torture of Africans in the Manyani concentration camp in Kenya, and the removal of the currently assembled troops and military bases in Kenya.
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Matadi (Belgian Congo) dispatch: On the evening of the 13th, Belgian colonial police opened fire in the port of Matadi in Lower Congo to suppress a group of Africans who were gathering to protest the authorities' imposition of a curfew. At least six Africans were killed and twenty were injured.
    The situation in the port of Matadi has been somewhat tense since last week. The Belgian colonial authorities imposed a curfew starting on October 9. Hundreds of people participated in the protest gathering on the 13th. There are reports that after the police conducted a live-fire suppression, the conflict spread to the entire city.
    Following the incident, the Belgian colonial authorities immediately declared martial law in the port of Matadi, strengthened the curfew, and dispatched armed police with submachine guns to patrol the streets and continue the suppression.

　　非洲人民前仆后继争取独立和自由
    喀麦隆人民武装英勇打击法国殖民军怯尼亚公众动员起来
    纪念“怯尼亚日”  比属刚果非洲人反对殖民当局的野蛮镇压
    新华社开罗13日电　据这里今天得到的消息说，喀麦隆民族主义者同法国殖民主义者在9月底前后发生了激烈的武装冲突，法军方面遭受了重大损失。
    消息说，喀麦隆民族主义者在巴米累克区的巴弗萨姆所进行的一次伏击中，杀死了三十名法国兵；在巴米累克区的另外一个地方班冈特，杀死了十六个法国人；在喀麦隆西南部的恩卡姆的亚巴西，杀死了法国区长，并且缴获了大量的物资；在基里比区的基里比，有五名法国军官和士兵被杀；在沙纳加海滨区的伊德亚，有两名法国区长被杀，在杜阿拉港，有四十辆法军汽车被民族主义者破坏了。
    这里的一位喀麦隆权威人士在评论这一情况时说，这标志着喀麦隆民族主义者斗争的重要发展。这位人士强调说，在法军最重要的中心之一的杜阿拉港，一次就破坏了四十辆法军车辆这一事实，证明法国殖民主义者没有力量对付这一局势。
    这位人士在谈到喀麦隆的政治局势时说，最近法国人为了想改善他们在喀麦隆的摇摇欲坠的地位，阴谋利用一个名叫马维·马提普的喀麦隆人民联盟的叛徒，来组织一个所谓“稳健的喀麦隆人民联盟政府”，以便反对“极端分子的喀麦隆人民联盟”。但是，这个阴谋遭到了喀麦隆人民联盟和喀麦隆人民的猛烈抨击，这种抨击迫使法国人不得不临时取消这一计划。
    新华社开罗14日电　怯尼亚人民将在10月20日纪念“怯尼亚日”，并且把这一天作为他们哀悼在英国枪弹下牺牲的三万多名同胞以及向全世界宣布他们要求自由的不屈不挠意志的日子。这是这里的非洲人协会怯尼亚办事处秘书安比索今天在记者招待会上说的。“怯尼亚日”是亚非人民团结理事会在今年2月决定的。
    安比索说，这一天是英国殖民者七年前在怯尼亚宣布“紧急状态”的日子。通过这次纪念活动，我们将动员我们自己的力量来进行另一次政治斗争。
    安比索在回顾过去三个月中英国殖民者在怯尼亚的镇压活动时说，最近英国殖民当局拒绝以奥金加·奥廷加为首的怯尼亚独立运动党进行登记：奥廷加本人也由于“没有获得当局的准许在一个大会上发表演说”而受到殖民者的迫害。
    英国殖民当局为了恫吓非洲人民，还在怯尼亚北部乔莫·肯雅塔被放逐的地区集结了一支三千五百多人的军队。
    安比索重申，怯尼亚人民要求立刻无条件释放乔莫·肯雅塔，他们将不接受怯尼亚制宪圆桌会议的任何决议，除非乔莫·肯雅塔以及其他因政治原因而被拘留的人可以自由地出席这个会议。
    安比索在讲话中要求结束在怯尼亚的“紧急状态”，彻底调查最近在怯尼亚马尼亚尼集中营里非洲人遭到极其残酷的折磨，以及撤除目前集结的军队和在怯尼亚的军事基地。
    新华社14日讯　马塔迪（比属刚果）消息：比利时殖民警察13日晚上在下刚果的马塔迪港开枪镇压一批集会抗议当局实行宵禁的非洲人。至少有六名非洲人被打死，二十人受伤。
    马塔迪港的局势从上星期起就有些紧张。比利时殖民当局在10月9日起实行了宵禁。有数百人参加了13日的抗议集会。有消息说，在警察进行实弹镇压后，冲突扩大到整个城市。
    在事件发生后，比利时殖民当局随即宣布马塔迪港戒严，加强宵禁，并且派出持有手提机关枪的武装警察在街道上巡逻，继续进行镇压。
