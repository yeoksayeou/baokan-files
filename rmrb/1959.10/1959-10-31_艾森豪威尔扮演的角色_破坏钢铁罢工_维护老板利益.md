(Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th) The latest issue of the American "Worker's Weekly" published an article by Art Shield, exposing the close relationship between U.S. President Eisenhower, who invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to undermine the strike of 500,000 steelworkers, and the big steel capitalists.

The article said that one of Eisenhower's closest friends happened to be a director of a steel company with a capital of ten billion dollars. Among his other closest friends, two were also directors of steel companies. These steel industry friends were all figures in the small circle of millionaires, including seven or eight people, around Eisenhower, who played golf or hunted with Eisenhower during the day and played bridge and other card games with him at night.

The article pointed out that Eisenhower is now using the Taft-Hartley Act to benefit his friends. The article said that when Eisenhower was preparing to take this action, he was "vacationing" with one of his friends. This person is one of Eisenhower's good friends, George Edward Allen. He is a director of Republic Steel Corporation.

Shield said that Allen is also a man who made a fortune on missiles. He is a member of the Senior Advisory Committee of Avco Manufacturing Corporation. This company earns more than 100 million U.S. dollars annually from Pentagon missile contracts and other arms deals.

Shield said that Eisenhower's good friend is also a director or trustee of another twenty-eight industrial enterprises, banks, public utilities, and insurance companies, which have tens of billions of dollars in assets.

Shield continued to write that another of Eisenhower's closest friends is George Humphrey, the former Secretary of the Treasury, and also the most ardent advocate of free employment of non-union members in the United States. Humphrey is the chairman of National Steel Corporation. Humphrey played an important role in Eisenhower's conspiracy to suppress the steelworkers' strike.

Shield wrote that Eisenhower's third closest friend is billionaire George Woodruff, a director of Atlantic Steel Company in Atlanta. Woodruff is also the chairman of the board of directors of Coca-Cola Company, which has distributors all over the world and has 300 million U.S. dollars in assets. He is also an important banker in the South and a major manufacturer of cotton gins. He is also a social leader of the southern financial aristocracy.

Shield concluded by saying that Eisenhower has never forgotten to state that he is the president of all the American people. But this statement is difficult to sell to 500,000 American steelworkers, because the role Eisenhower played in sabotaging the strike only benefited his good friends. (Attached picture)

    艾森豪威尔扮演的角色
    破坏钢铁罢工　维护老板利益
    据新华社29日讯　纽约消息：最近一期的美国“工人周报”刊载了阿尔特·希耳德写的一篇文章，揭露援引了塔夫脱—哈特莱法破坏五十万钢铁工人罢工的美国总统艾森豪威尔同大钢铁资本家的密切关系。
    文章说，艾森豪威尔最密切的一个朋友恰好是一家拥有十亿美元资本的钢铁公司的董事。在他的其他最亲密的朋友中，有两个人也是钢铁公司的董事。这些钢铁界的朋友都是艾森豪威尔周围的包括了七八个百万富翁的小圈子中的人物，他们白天同艾森豪威尔打高尔夫球或打猎，晚上同他玩桥牌和其他牌戏。
    文章指出，艾森豪威尔现在以玩弄塔夫脱—哈特莱法的把戏为他的朋友们带来好处。文章说，在艾森豪威尔准备采取这一行动的时候他正在和他的一个朋友在一起“度假”。这个人就是艾森豪威尔的好朋友之一乔治·爱德华·艾伦。他是共和钢铁公司的董事。
    希耳德说，艾伦也是一个在导弹上发大财的人。他是阿弗科制造公司高级谘询委员会的委员。这家公司每年从五角大楼的导弹合同和其他军火买卖中获得一亿多美元。
    希耳德说，艾森豪威尔的这位好朋友也是另外二十八家工业企业、银行、公用事业和保险公司的董事或理事，这些企业、银行和公司一共有几十亿美元的财产。
    希耳德接着写道，艾森豪威尔另一个最亲密的朋友是乔治·汉弗莱，他是前财政部长，并且也是美国最激烈鼓吹自由雇用非工会会员的人。汉弗莱是全国钢铁公司的主席。汉弗莱在艾森豪威尔这次镇压钢铁工人罢工的阴谋中扮演着重要的角色。
    希耳德写道，艾森豪威尔的第三个最亲密的朋友是亿万富翁乔治·伍德拉夫，他是亚特兰大大西洋钢铁公司的董事。伍德拉夫也是可口可乐公司董事会的董事长，这家公司在世界各地都有经销处，并且有三亿美元的财产。他也是美国南部的一个重要的银行家，并且是轧棉机的主要制造商。他同时也是南部金融贵族的一个社会领袖。
    希耳德最后说，艾森豪威尔从没有忘记说明，他是全体美国人民的总统。但是这种说法难以向五十万美国钢铁工人兜售，因为艾森豪威尔所扮演的破坏罢工的角色只是对他的好朋友们有利。（附图片）
