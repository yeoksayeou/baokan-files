　　Heavy-Duty Marine Diesel Engine
    Fitted with Latest Supercharger, High Efficiency, Low Fuel Consumption

    (Our Dispatch) China's first domestically designed 2,000-horsepower low-speed heavy-duty marine diesel engine equipped with a waste gas turbocharger has been manufactured at the Shanghai Hudong Shipyard. After evaluation, the quality and performance of this diesel engine are fully qualified. It marks an important step in China's diesel engine manufacturing technology towards the world's peak.

    The engine block and frame of this diesel engine adopt the most advanced welded structure, which has high strength and light weight; it can use No. 3 heavy oil as fuel, which is very economical. It is equipped with a world-leading two-stroke waste gas turbocharger designed by the Marine Science Institute, so the horsepower is increased by about 30% compared with before supercharging, and the fuel consumption is reduced by about 8%.

    Encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, the designers took only four months to design this large diesel engine weighing more than seventy tons. In the manufacturing process, the workers displayed the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, overcame many difficulties, and took only forty-five days from the start of manufacturing to assembly completion, breaking through many world's cutting-edge technology fortresses that were originally considered unattainable. The supercharger manufactured by this factory is currently the largest in China, and its performance has reached world standards after trial run and evaluation.

　　重型船用柴油机
    装有最新增压器  功效高  耗油少
    本报讯　我国自行设计的第一台装有废汽涡轮增压器的二千马力低速重型船用柴油机，在上海沪东造船厂制成。经过鉴定，这台柴油机的质量和性能完全合格。它标志着我国柴油机制造技术向世界高峰跨出了重要的一步。
    这台柴油机的机座和机架都采用了最先进的电焊结构，强度高，重量轻；能使用三号重油作燃料，很为经济。它装置有船舶科学研究所设计的世界最新技术的二冲程废汽涡轮增压器，因此马力较增压前提高30％左右，耗油量减少8％左右。
    在大跃进的鼓舞下，设计人员只用了四个月的时间就设计出这台重达七十多吨的大型柴油机。在制造过程中，工人们发挥了敢想敢做精神，战胜了重重困难，从开始制造到装配完成只用了四十五天的时间，突破了许多原来被认为是高不可攀的世界尖端技术堡垒。这个厂制成的这台增压器，是目前国内最大的，经过试车鉴定性能达到了世界水平。
