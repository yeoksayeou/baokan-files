Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 14th: The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" said today that the United Nations General Assembly's decision to include the so-called "Tibet issue," which belongs to the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, on the agenda of the General Assembly, is absolutely illegal and violates the United Nations Charter.

The newspaper said that no one would be surprised that the Federation of Malaya and Ireland raised the "Tibet issue" in the General Committee of the United Nations. This is merely a conspiracy by certain Western imperialists, primarily US imperialism, to use the "Tibet issue" to launch a new movement hostile to the People's Republic of China, implement their "Cold War" policy within the United Nations, and poison the international atmosphere that is moving towards détente.

The newspaper concluded, "The people of Asia and Africa and friends of peace and justice throughout the world resolutely oppose this illegal decision of the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 15th: The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" published a commentary today entitled "An Act of Slander and Provocation," stating that Albanian public opinion sternly condemns the illegal resolution to include the so-called "Tibet issue" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.

The commentary said that the proposal on the so-called "Tibet issue" was only passed by the US delegation with the help of means and pressure through the voting machine of the majority.

The commentary said that all honest and peace-loving people clearly know that the despicable conspiracy of the provocateurs and organizers is only to use the old trick to incite opposition to China and against easing international tensions. The commentary said that everyone knows that Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times, and no one can think that the United Nations can interfere in China's internal affairs; only those blind people who do not face up to socialist countries, only those who reverse black and white and attempt to reuse "Cold War" tools in the United Nations, and deny historical factors, will use despicable means to pass illegal resolutions. The commentary said that all peace-loving people, including the Albanian people, see from this despicable trick that some people in Washington and their supporters are afraid of the change in the international climate and the establishment of mutual trust between countries, so they provoke this non-existent issue, conspire to poison the atmosphere, and seal the "Cold War" ice that has just begun to melt.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, October 15th: The Cambodian newspaper "Ekareach" said yesterday that "the United Nations has no reason to discuss China's internal affairs on the so-called Tibet issue," and that such a discussion "is not good for world peace."

The newspaper also said that the representatives of the "free world," who claim to love mankind, should enthusiastically discuss the Algerian issue and allow the Algerian people to gain freedom. The United Nations should also seriously discuss the disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 15th: The Indonesian newspaper "Harian Rakjat" published an editorial today, sternly condemning the United Nations for illegally discussing the "Tibet issue," and pointed out that the "Tibet issue" is purely China's internal affair. The newspaper's editorial said that the United Nations' arbitrary and forcible discussion of China's internal affairs and attempts to slander China in various ways show that the United Nations disregards the rights of all countries and abandons justice.

The newspaper said that the United Nations' decision to discuss the "Tibet issue" created a precedent in the United Nations that threatens the independence and security of all countries. It said that this precedent will give imperialists the opportunity to arbitrarily plot rebellions in other countries. If they fail, they will slander the countries concerned and force the United Nations to discuss and make resolutions unfavorable to the countries concerned. The editorial pointed out that it is hard to say that one day, imperialism will also slander Indonesia and submit the issue of domestic rebellion in Indonesia to the United Nations for discussion and decision.

　　越、阿、柬和印度尼西亚报纸谴责联大讨论“西藏问题”
    中国内政不容干涉坚决反对冷战阴谋
    新华社河内14日电　越南“人民报”今天说，联合国大会把属于中华人民共和国内政问题的所谓“西藏问题”列入大会议程的决定，是绝对非法的，是违反联合国宪章的。
    这家报纸说，马来亚联合邦和爱尔兰在联合国总务委员会提出“西藏问题”，谁也不会对此感到意外。这只是某些西方帝国主义、首先是美帝国主义的一个阴谋，它们要利用“西藏问题”发动一个敌视中华人民共和国的新运动，就在联合国内执行它们的“冷战”政策，和毒化正在走向缓和的国际气氛。
    报纸最后说，“亚非人民和全世界和平和正义的朋友坚决反对联合国的这个非法决定。”
    新华社地拉那15日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”今天以“诬蔑和挑衅的行为”为题发表的一篇评论指出，阿尔巴尼亚公众舆论严正地谴责把所谓“西藏问题”列入联合国大会议程的非法决议。
    评论说，所谓“西藏问题”的提案只是美国代表团借助手段和压力通过多数投票机器所通过的。
    评论说，所有正直和爱好和平的人们都清楚地知道，挑拨者和组织者的卑鄙阴谋只是想以老一套的办法来煽动反对中国和反对缓和国际紧张局势。评论说，谁都知道，西藏自古以来就是中国不可分割的一部分，任何人都不能认为联合国可以干涉中国内政，只是那些不正视社会主义国家的瞎子，只是颠倒黑白和企图在联合国重新使用“冷战”工具、否认历史因素的人，才会运用卑鄙的手段通过非法的决议。评论说，所有爱好和平的人民，包括阿尔巴尼亚人民在内，从这一卑鄙的手段中看到，华盛顿某些人和他们的支持者害怕国际气候的转变和建立各国之间的相互信任，所以他们挑起这一不存在的问题，阴谋毒化气氛，封上刚开始融解的“冷战”冰块。
    新华社金边15日电　柬埔寨“统一报”昨天说，“联合国没有理由讨论所谓西藏问题的中国内政”，这种讨论“对于世界和平没有好处”。
    这家报纸还说，标榜自己是爱人类的“自由世界”的代表应当热心地讨论阿尔及利亚问题，让阿尔及利亚人民获得自由，联合国还应当认真讨论苏联提出的裁军建议。
    新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚“东星报”今天发表社论严正谴责联合国非法讨论“西藏问题”，并且指出，“西藏问题”纯粹是中国的内政问题。这家报纸的社论说，联合国擅自强行讨论中国的内政问题和企图对中国进行种种诽谤，这表明，联合国漠视各国的权利和抛弃了正义。
    这家报纸说，联合国关于讨论“西藏问题”的决定，在联合国里开创了威胁各国独立和安全的先例。它说，这个先例将使帝国主义者有机会肆意在其它国家里策划叛乱。如果他们遭到失败，他们将对有关国家进行诽谤，并且强迫联合国讨论和作出对有关国家不利的决议。社论指出，很难说，有朝一日，帝国主义也会对印度尼西亚进行诽谤，并且把印度尼西亚国内叛乱的问题提交联合国讨论和决定。
