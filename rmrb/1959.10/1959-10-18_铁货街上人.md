People on Tiehuo Street
　　Yu Cui
　　Our Tiehuo Street is known to everyone in Xuzhou. It used to be known as a dirty and smelly street, but now it is known as a beautiful little garden. Comrade, this change didn't come easy! But, when it comes to the people and things on our Tiehuo Street, it will make you both shed tears and smile. Let me take you to visit some of the old neighbors.

　　Look, isn't that Aunt Wang coming from over there? She is dressed so neatly and smartly: a snow-white bamboo cloth jacket, blue cotton pants, a pair of snow-blue sock covers and blue serge shoes. She is on her way to work at the woodworking factory! Going to work and laboring in the factory on time may not seem like much to you, but to Aunt Wang, it is more beautiful than any dreamland. Her forty years before liberation were like a nightmare. More than forty years ago, her father farmed for landlords in Kaifeng, Henan. Her family of seven or eight suffered from hunger and cold. Her mother starved to death, and she led her younger siblings everywhere to beg for food, but her younger siblings also starved to death. At the age of nineteen, she married, but she still had to beg for food, and another child starved to death. Soon after, her husband also died from illness and hunger. She fled to Xuzhou with others and married her current husband, Uncle Wang. But the bitter days were not over. She couldn't bear to watch her husband starve to death again. She took her two children to beg for food in other places, so that her husband could have something to eat. It wasn't until the liberation of Xuzhou that her family of four was reunited.

　　In 1956, the relief recipients on Tiehuo Street responded to the government's call for production for self-salvation and organized under the leadership of the neighborhood committee. Aunt Wang had long hoped to be self-sufficient and not hold back the country's socialist construction. She actively participated in the paper picking group and was later transferred to the woodworking group. Now she does odd jobs in this woodworking factory, which was started from scratch by the residents of our street, and earns more than ten yuan a month. Together with her husband's income, they have a total of thirty or forty yuan a month. Don't think that thirty or forty yuan is not much, Aunt Wang is very thrifty. Last year, they bought thirty-five yuan of public bonds. This year, the state is not issuing public bonds, so they are responding to the government's call for saving and depositing several yuan in the bank every month.

　　From a life of begging for food to having enough to eat and wear, with both children in school, and being able to save money every month, isn't the contrast between the past and the present like heaven and earth? She gave herself a name, Yuan Houfa. Houfa, Houfa, having tasted all the bitterness of the world in the first half of her life of displacement, she is now blessed by the Communist Party in the second half of her life!

　　Let's go this way, this is the repair team on our street. There is an old man named Han Guanghou here, who is also one of our old residents. This "old" resident had never lived in a room that could be called a "house" before liberation. He just built a thatched shack to shelter from the wind and rain. The best job he could find was pulling a rickshaw, otherwise he would beg for food with his children and wife. He had a pair of single pants that he wore for many years, patched upon patched, and finally weighed five and a half pounds. But now, his son has become a cadre, his daughter-in-law is in the millstone group on the street, the old man himself has joined the street's house repair group, and his old wife, Aunt Han, also does odd jobs in our woodworking factory's sawdust group. The whole family not only wears new clothes and sleeps under new quilts, but also keeps their house clean and bright. If we have time later, let's go to her house for a visit.

　　Which one of us on Tiehuo Street is not like Yuan Houfa and Han Guanghou, suffering from hunger and cold in the old society, enduring all kinds of torture in the world? Tiehuo Street was originally a slum in Taipingwa. Taipingwa is a large depression left in Xuzhou by the old course of the Yellow River. Decades ago, this depression was a desolate mass grave. Later, people who fled from Henan, Anhui and other places, unable to afford rent, built small shacks between the graves and lived next to the lonely ghosts. More and more people fled here, and the graves were slowly leveled, barely forming a street. What kind of street was it, it was simply a stinking pond! In summer, when it rained heavily, sewage from all directions poured into this depression. Dead cats and dead dogs also floated in, and maggots crawled everywhere. The stinking water flooded into the houses, and people used bricks to raise the beds and moved the pots, pans, and stoves to the beds to cook. When an infectious disease came, the plague gods and ghosts always haunted our people here. How many people died from disease and starvation! People said: "Taipingwa is not peaceful, half ghosts, half people!" In those years, what was there to live for? Didn't many people despair and seek short lives?

　　The joy of life! We only tasted it after liberation. As soon as liberation came, the residents on our street were employed one after another. Those who could not find employment for a while were given relief by the government if their families had difficulties. After sewers were built here in 1952, the days of being flooded were gone forever.

　　We are not willing to rely on government relief to live. Everyone is contributing to the country's socialist construction, but we are increasing the burden on the country. Can we feel at ease? In 1956, the government called for production for self-salvation, and everyone said this was a good way. But we didn't have any capital, so we could only do jobs that required labor but not capital. Thanks to the director of our neighborhood committee, Chu Qinglan, and the cadres on the street, who ran around all day to find ways, we found many jobs: making soles, spinning yarn from old cotton, cleaning waste paper for department stores and selling it to paper mills… Although this was a small business, the relief recipients who participated in production could earn several yuan a month! Little by little, we slowly accumulated public funds and added flatbed carts, sewing machines…, and the avenues for production became more and more numerous. Now our street has woodworking, refractory materials, weaving, clothing sewing and other factories and production groups. The residents on our street, as long as they are able to work, have either joined the country's factories and agencies or participated in the street's production organizations. The elderly, weak, disabled, and those who have completely lost their ability to work are given relief from our public funds, and we no longer ask the state for relief funds!

　　Life has made us younger, and we also use our own hands and labor to make life more beautiful like youth! Look! This stinking depression, which everyone used to hold their noses and walk past, has become a beautiful city garden. Two vertical and intersecting streets, where more than four hundred households are located, are tightly nestled under Yunlong Mountain, which is covered with green trees. At the east end of the street, there is a large lotus pond to the north and a vegetable garden to the south. Over there, pigsties and sheepfolds are being built, and the vegetable garden will be expanded. In the future, new houses and bathhouses will be built… Look at the red pavilion by the lotus pond, how energetically those children are playing. How would they know what Taipingwa was like ten years ago?

　　Speaking of which, it's noon, the cafeteria is ahead, let's go in and have a meal and taste our fresh vegetables and fresh fish from the lotus pond…

### 铁货街上人

　　铁货街上人
　　俞璀
　　俺们这铁货街，在徐州市也称得上人人知道。原先知道它是有名的脏街臭街，现在知道它美得像小花园。同志，这变得不易啊！可是，要说起俺们铁货街上那些人，那些事，那就叫您又要掉眼泪，又要笑呵呵。我就带您去拜访一些老街坊吧。
    您瞧，从那边走过来的，不是王大娘吗？她一身穿得好干净俐落：雪白的竹布褂，青洋布裤，一双雪青袜套和青直贡呢鞋，这会儿她正上木器厂去上班哩！按时到工厂里去上班和劳动，在你们也许算不了什么，可是在王大娘看来，可比梦里的任何美境都要美哩。她那解放以前的四十多年光阴，真是像一场恶梦。四十多年前，她爹在河南开封给地主种地，一家七、八口人挨饥受冻，她娘饿死了，她领着弟弟妹妹到处去乞讨，弟弟妹妹也饿死了。十九岁上她嫁了人，她还是去讨饭，活生生的又饿死了一个孩子。不久，丈夫也连病带饿死去。她随人逃荒来到了徐州，嫁给她现在的丈夫——王大伯。可是苦日子还是没有完，她再也不忍看着自己的丈夫饿死。拉扯着两个孩子到外地去讨饭，好让丈夫一个人能混上口饭吃。直到徐州解放，她们一家四口才重新团圆。
    1956年，铁货街的救济户们响应政府的生产自救的号召，在居民委员会的领导下组织起来生产了。王大娘早就盼望能够自食其力，不要拖国家社会主义建设的后腿，她积极地参加了拣纸组，后来又被调到木器组。现在她就在这个由咱们街道上的居民们白手兴办起来的木器厂里作些杂活儿，每月有十几元的工资。再加上她丈夫的收入，每月共有三、四十元。别看三、四十元的数目不多，王大娘可会精打细算哩，去年，他们家里就买了三十五元的公债。今年国家不发行公债了，他们又响应政府的节约储蓄的号召，每月到银行去存上几元。
    从叫化乞讨的生活，居然变成有吃有穿，两个孩子都上了学，月月还能有储蓄，今昔对比，这不是天上地下么？她就给自己取了个名字，叫袁后发。后发啊，后发，在前半辈子的颠沛流离生活中尝尽了人间的苦辣，这后半辈子却托了共产党的福发祥起来啦！
    往这边走，这儿就是俺街道上的修缮队。这儿有个韩广厚老大爷，也是咱们这里的一位老居民。这位“老”居民，在解放前从来没有住上过一间称得上“屋子”的房。只是用茅草搭个窝棚避避风雨。他找到过的最好的职业就是拉洋车，不然就是和孩子老婆一起讨饭。他有一条穿了多年的单裤，补钉罗补钉，最后重量竟达到了五斤半。但现在，他的儿子已经当了干部，儿媳妇在街道上的碾子组，老大爷自己参加了街上的房屋修缮组，老伴韩大娘也在俺木器厂锯末组作杂活儿。一家大小，不但早已穿上了新衣，盖上了新被，就是家里的屋子也收拾得窗明几净。待会儿有空，咱们上她家串门子去。
    俺们铁货街上人，哪一个不是像袁后发、韩广厚那样，在旧社会里忍饿受冻，受尽了人间的折磨？这铁货街原来是太平洼里的一个贫民区。太平洼是黄河故道给徐州留下的一片大洼地。几十年前，这洼地里是个荒无人烟的乱葬岗，后来，从河南、安徽等地逃荒来的人，租不起房子，就在这里的坟头中间搭个小窝棚跟孤魂野鬼做邻居。逃荒来的人越来越多，坟头就慢慢平掉了，好歹算条街道了。哪里是什么街，简直就是臭水塘！夏天一下大雨，四面八方的污水就往这块洼地里灌。死猫死狗也漂来了，蛆虫到处爬。臭水漫到屋子里，人们就用砖头把床垫高，把锅盆炉灶都搬到床上去做饭。传染病一来，瘟神疫鬼就老缠住咱们这儿的人。病死饿死的，不知有多少！人们都说：“太平洼，不太平，一半鬼，一半人！”那年月啊，有什么过头？不是许多人就绝望地去寻短了么？
    生活的乐趣呵！咱们还是从解放以后才尝到的。打一解放，咱们街道上的住户陆续地就业了，一时没能就业的，家里有了困难就由政府救济。1952年这里修了下水道以后，挨水淹的日子也一去不复返了。
    咱们是不甘愿老靠政府的救济来过活的。人人都在为国家的社会主义建设出力，咱们却替国家增加负担，能过意得去吗？1956年，政府号召生产自救，大家都说这个办法好。只是咱们没有本钱，搞生产只能拣些出劳力不出资金的活儿干。多亏咱们居民委员会的主任褚庆兰和街道上的干部们，成天东奔西跑，到处去找门路，才找到了许多活：纳鞋底，用旧棉花纺线绳，代百货公司清理废纸卖给造纸厂……别看这是小本经营，参加生产的救济户一月也能分到好几块钱哩！凑少成多，咱们也慢慢地有了公积金，添制了板车、缝纫机……，生产的门路也越来越多了。现在咱这街道上已经有了木器、耐火器材、织布，被服缝纫等工厂和生产组，咱们街道上的居民，但凡能工作的，不是参加了国家的工厂和机关工作，就是参加了街道上的生产组织。完全丧失了劳动力的老弱残废者，就从咱们的公积金中拨款来救济，不再伸手向国家要救济款啦！
    生活使我们变年轻了，我们也用自己的双手和劳动来使生活更富于青春般的美丽！你瞧！这过去人人捏着鼻子走过的臭洼地，已经变成了一个美丽的市内花园。座落着四百多户人家的两条垂直交叉的街道，紧紧地依傍在绿树满山的云龙山下。街东头，北边是一个大荷塘，南边是一片蔬菜地。那头，正在修猪圈、羊圈，蔬菜地还要扩大。将来，还要盖新屋，盖澡堂……您瞧那荷花池边的红亭子里，那群孩子玩得多有劲，他们那里知道十年前太平洼的光景呢？
    说着说着，到中午了，前面就是食堂，进去吃顿饭吧，尝尝咱们的新鲜蔬菜和荷花塘里的鲜鱼……
