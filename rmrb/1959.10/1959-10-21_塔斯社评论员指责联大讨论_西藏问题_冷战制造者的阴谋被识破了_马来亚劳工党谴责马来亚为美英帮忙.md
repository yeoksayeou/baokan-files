Xinhua News Agency, October 20th -- TASS commentator Kharikov wrote on the 20th: The initiators who proposed the so-called "Tibetan question" in the United Nations are employing various conspiracies to turn this "supplementary proposal" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly into a primary issue. Supporters of the "Cold War" are desperately trying to force the conference itself to discuss the provocative proposals made by Malaya and Ireland, avoiding any discussion of this issue in any committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The reason why these people are so nervous and impatient is because their provocative conspiracy has been quickly exposed in Asia. In Asia, this conspiracy is seen as an attempt to create division in the peace-loving family of Asian nations, to hinder the good cooperation between People's China and other Asian countries, and as a new trap for conducting the "Cold War."

Kharikov said that most Asian and African delegations do not support including the "Tibetan question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. Asian public opinion believes that discussing the "Tibetan question" in the United Nations is illegal because such discussion violates the charter and purposes of the United Nations. Asian politicians, social figures, and some newspapers have revealed the true purpose of those with ulterior motives in raising the "Tibetan question."

Reactionaries, knowing that they are powerless to undermine the growing friendship between the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries, have no other choice but to fabricate rumors and slanders, and resort to such despicable means to slander the "Tibetan situation." Many Asian newspapers have torn off the masks of those who want to use the high-sounding rhetoric of philanthropy to conceal their provocative intentions "on the Tibetan question."

Kharikov pointed out that it is generally known in Asia that a reactionary and conspiratorial rebellion took place in Tibet, which was supported and directed from abroad. After the failure in Tibet, these forces are now trying to turn the discussion of the "Tibetan question" in the United Nations into a precedent, so that when reactionary rebellions in other countries fail, they can also coerce the United Nations to make resolutions that suit the reactionaries.

Kharikov concluded that many independent Asian countries regard the principle of peaceful coexistence as the cornerstone of their international relations. The current relaxation of international tensions undoubtedly helps to promote this principle more widely. The seeds of division and discord that evil forces are trying to sow in Asia will not sprout.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th -- Kuala Lumpur dispatch: The Sixth National Congress of the Malayan Labour Party passed a resolution on the 18th condemning the action of the Federation of Malaya's representative to the United Nations in proposing the so-called "Tibetan question" at the United Nations General Assembly, which interferes in China's internal affairs. The resolution pointed out that this action "is merely to cater to the appetites of the United States and Britain."

According to newspaper reports, many delegates attending the meeting spoke out to criticize the government's aforementioned actions before the resolution was passed. Legislative Councillor David, a member of the Labour Party Executive Committee, emphasized: "The Malayan government's actions in the United Nations clearly show that Malaya has not followed the principles established at the Bandung Conference. It also clearly shows that Malaya and its representatives in the United Nations have been reduced to being the ugly assistants of the United Kingdom and the United States."

The Labour Party held its Sixth National Congress in Seremban, the capital of Negeri Sembilan, on the 17th and 18th. More than 130 delegates from various state branches and more than 700 observers attended the congress. The Labour Party is a member of the Malayan People's Socialist Front.

    塔斯社评论员指责联大讨论“西藏问题”
    冷战制造者的阴谋被识破了
    马来亚劳工党谴责马来亚为美英帮忙
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社评论员哈里科夫在20日写道：在联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”的发起人施展种种阴谋诡计，想把这个在联合国大会议程上的“补充提案”变为首要的问题。“冷战”的支持者不顾一切地企图迫使会议本身讨论马来亚和爱尔兰提出的挑衅性的提案，避免在联合国大会任何委员会中讨论这个问题。这些人之所以这样神经质和迫不急待，是因为他们的挑拨性阴谋在亚洲很快地被识破了。在亚洲，这个阴谋被看作是一种想在亚洲各国人民爱好和平的大家庭中制造分歧、妨碍人民中国同其他亚洲国家良好合作的企图，是进行“冷战”的新的圈套。
    哈里科夫说，大多数亚非国家代表团都不支持把“西藏问题”列入联合国大会的议程。亚洲公众认为，在联合国讨论“西藏问题”是不合法的，因为这种讨论违反联合国组织的宪章和宗旨。亚洲国家的政界人士和社会名流以及一些报纸揭露了那些居心叵测的人挑起“西藏问题”的真正目的。
    反动分子自知无能为力破坏中国人民同亚洲其他国家人民日益发展的友谊，他们没有别的办法，只好造谣中伤，并且采取这种卑鄙的手段来对“西藏局势”大肆诽谤。亚洲许多报纸撕下了那些想用博爱的高调来掩饰他们“在西藏问题”上的挑衅目的的人的假面目。
    哈里科夫指出，在亚洲，人们普遍知道，在西藏发生了反动的阴谋叛乱，这种叛乱受到外来的支持和指使。在西藏遭到失败后，这种势力现在企图把在联合国讨论“西藏问题”变为一种先例，以便使它们在其他国家反动叛乱失败时也可以要挟联合国作出反动派所称心的决议。
    哈里科夫最后说，亚洲许多独立国家把和平共处原则当作自己的国际关系的基石。目前所出现的国际紧张局势的某种缓和无疑地有助于更广泛地推广这种原则。恶势力企图在亚洲播种的分歧和纠纷的种子是不会出芽的。
    据新华社20日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚劳工党第六届全国代表大会18日通过决议，谴责马来亚联合邦出席联合国的代表在联合国大会上提出干涉中国内政的所谓“西藏问题”的作法。决议指出，这个作法“只不过是为了迎合美国和英国的胃口”。
    据报纸报道，在通过这项决议以前，出席会议的许多代表纷纷发言抨击政府的上述行动。立法议员、劳工党执行委员会委员戴维强调说：“马来亚政府在联合国的行动清楚地表明，马来亚并没有遵循万隆会议所确定的原则。同时还清楚地表明，马来亚和它在联合国的代表已经沦为英美的丑角助手”。
    劳工党在17和18日两天在森美兰州首府芙蓉召开了第六届全国代表大会。出席大会的有各州分部代表一百三十余人以及列席代表七百余人。劳工党是马来亚人民社会主义阵线的成员之一。
