Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, October 27th: The Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers, Lubsan, on the evening of October 27th, on behalf of the Presidium of the Mongolian Great People's Hural and the Council of Ministers, awarded medals, decorations, and certificates of merit to a group of Chinese bridge construction workers.

The Chinese workers came here under the 1958 Sino-Mongolian agreement on China's provision of economic and technical assistance to Mongolia to help Mongolia build three bridges. They have made excellent achievements in the construction of the bridge projects, which were recently completed ahead of schedule.

Lubsan said at the award ceremony that the completion of these three bridges is of great significance in overcoming the difficulties in Mongolia's transportation. This is the internationalist assistance given by the Chinese people to the Mongolian people, and a clear sign of the common cooperation of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.

Lian Bosheng, the representative of the Chinese Ministry of Communications who came here to hand over the bridges, also spoke at the award ceremony. On behalf of the Chinese bridge-building workers, he thanked the Mongolian Great People's Hural and the Council of Ministers for the high awards given, and encouraged the workers to continue their efforts and make greater achievements in their new work, and to make contributions to the continuous strengthening of the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people.

    蒙古举行授奖仪式
    奖励帮助建筑桥梁的我国职工
    据新华社乌兰巴托27日电　蒙古部长会议副主席鲁布桑27日晚代表蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团和部长会议授给一批中国桥梁建筑职工以勋章、奖章和奖状。
    中国职工是根据1958年中蒙关于中国给予蒙古经济和技术援助的协定来这里帮助蒙古建设三座桥梁的。他们在最近提前完成的桥梁工程的建设过程中作出了优良的成绩。
    鲁布桑在授奖仪式上讲话说，这三座桥梁的建成对克服蒙古交通运输上的困难具有很大意义。这是中国人民给予蒙古人民的国际主义援助，是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国共同合作的显明标志。
    来这里移交桥梁的中国交通部移交代表连伯生也在授奖仪式上讲了话。他代表中国建桥职工感谢蒙古大人民呼拉尔和部长会议所给予的崇高奖励，并且勉励职工们再接再厉在新的工作中作出更大的成绩，为不断加强中蒙两国人民的友谊作出贡献。
