　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Léopoldville: Belgian colonial authorities are instigating and exploiting disputes between certain tribes in the Congo to cruelly suppress the Congolese people who oppose colonial rule and the "election" fraud.
　　The news said that after the bloody incident in Luluabourg, Lower Congo, on the 14th, in which twenty Congolese were killed by the Belgian colonial authorities, the situation there remained tense. The "security forces" continued to sweep through the area on the 17th. As of the evening of the 16th, the official death toll had reached thirty-four.
　　On the evening of the 16th, Belgian colonial police surrounded a Lulua village near Demba, north of Luluabourg, and were met with resistance from the Lulua people. The Belgian colonial police opened fire with light machine guns, killing four Lulua people and arresting fifty others.
　　In Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo, tension increased, and police patrols were also strengthened.
　　According to the Belgian Congo "African Messenger" of October 2nd, the nationalist political organization Abako in the Belgian Congo is still actively operating in the Lower Congo region, where the Lulua people are responding to Abako's call to refuse to participate in local town elections.
　　According to an article titled "Blood Is Being Shed in the Belgian Congo" published in the Senegalese weekly "New Africa" on October 9th, with only three months to go before the so-called local "elections," the "situation in the Belgian Congo has never been worse"; "It is found that the entire Lower Congo region is in a state of non-violent rebellion." The article said, "The authority of the Belgian authorities does not work everywhere: the residents do not participate in any gatherings, and they resist various elections held to establish new local administrative organizations."
　　The article also said, "The atmosphere has reached such a point that in the Falls area, local police are asking for the protection of armed personnel, and the authorities in some cities are beginning to doubt the reliability of the local police."
　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Brussels: In order to ease the strong emotions of the Congolese people demanding independence and maintain its colonial rule in the Congo, the Belgian government announced on the 16th a deceptive plan that superficially promised to grant the Congo so-called "independence" in 1964.
　　According to the plan announced by the Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs, Mr. De Schrijver, "elections" for territorial and municipal councils will be held throughout the Congo in December this year.
　　In March 1960, a provincial council will be established for each of the six provinces of the Congo. In August or September 1960, a Senate, a House of Representatives, and a government governing the entire territory of the Congo will be established. They have no power to decide on foreign policy or monetary system issues. Moreover, the head of the government must still be the Governor-General appointed by the King of Belgium.
　　At the end of the term of the first parliament (no more than four years), a "constitution" will be formulated. However, the Congo will not achieve true independence as a result. According to De Schrijver, "We promise independence, but we certainly do not think this must mean separation." He said that at that time, Belgium and the Congo would decide on the "joint system" to be established.
　　The Belgian government's deceptive plan was put forward against the backdrop of its inability to cope with the situation. Since the Congolese people launched a vigorous anti-colonialist struggle in January this year, the Belgian authorities have carried out brutal suppression and have also put forward a vague promise to grant the Congo "independence" in the future, but this has not frustrated the Congolese people's will to fight for national independence. The situation in the Congo has been turbulent. It is reported that when the Belgian's current plan was still being formulated, some Congolese political parties expressed their opposition one after another, demanding that the Congo achieve independence quickly.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Brussels: While announcing a deceptive plan to grant the Congo "independence" in the future, the Belgian government is planning to send more troops to suppress the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle.
　　According to a Reuters reporter in Brussels, "usually well-informed sources" said on the evening of the 16th that the Belgian Ministry of Defense was considering sending three hundred "riot suppression troops" to help guard the three military bases in the Belgian Congo.

　　刚果人民不屈不挠反对殖民统治
    比利时当局一面宣布欺骗性的“独立”计划一面加紧血腥镇压
    据新华社18日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比利时殖民当局正在策动和利用刚果某些部族之间的纠纷，残酷镇压反对殖民统治和“选举”骗局的刚果人民。
    消息说，下刚果的路路阿堡地区在14日发生二十个刚果人被比利时殖民当局打死的流血事件后，那里的局势仍然紧张。“治安队”17日继续在这个地区扫荡。到16日晚上为止，官方统计的死亡数字已经达到三十四人。
    16日晚上，比利时殖民警察包围了路路阿堡以北登巴附近的一个路路阿族村庄，遭到了路路阿族人的反击。比利时殖民警察用轻机枪开火，打死四个路路阿族人，还逮捕了五十人。
    在比属刚果的首府利奥波德维尔，紧张气氛增加了，警察巡逻队也加强了。
    据比属刚果“非洲信使报”10月2日报道，比属刚果的民族主义政治组织阿巴科仍积极在下刚果地区活动，在那里，路路阿族人都响应阿巴科的号召，拒绝参加地方市镇选举。
    另据塞内加尔“新非洲”周刊10月9日刊载的一篇题目为“在比属刚果正在流血”的文章说，在距所谓地方“选举”只有三个月的时候，比属刚果的“局势从来没有更坏过”；“人们发现整个下刚果地区都处在非暴力叛乱状态中”。文章说，“比利时当局的权力到处都行不通：居民们不参加任何集会，他们抵制为建立新的本地地方行政组织而举行的各种选举”。
    这篇文章还说，“气氛竟然达到如此地步，以致在瀑布地区，地方警察都要求武装人员的保护，而某些城市的当局开始怀疑地方警察们的可靠性”。
    据新华社17日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时政府为了缓和刚果人民要求独立的强烈情绪和保持它在刚果的殖民统治，16日宣布了一项表面上答应让刚果在1964年获得所谓“独立”的欺骗性计划。
    根据由比利时刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣德舒里弗宣布的这个计划，今年12月要在刚果全国进行领地和市镇议会“选举”。
    1960年3月，将为刚果的六个省各建立一个省议会。1960年8月或9月，要建立参议院、众议院和一个管辖刚果全境的政府。它们都没有决定外交政策或币制方面的权力。而且政府的首脑还必须由比利时国王指派的总督担任。
    在第一届议会任期届满时（不超过四年），将制订一部“宪法”。但是，刚果并不能由此取得真正的独立。据德舒里弗说，“我们答应独立，但是我们当然并不认为这必须意味着分离。”他说，那时，比利时和刚果将决定要建立的“联合制度”。
    比利时政府的这个欺骗性计划是在它无法收拾局面的背景下提出的。自从今年1月刚果人民展开轰轰烈烈的反殖民主义的斗争以来，比利时当局进行了残暴的镇压，还曾提出了一项答应将来给刚果“独立”的空泛诺言，但是这都不能挫折刚果人民争取民族独立的意志。刚果局势一直在动荡中。据报道，当比利时目前这个计划还在拟订时，刚果一些政党就纷纷表示反对，它们要求让刚果迅速实现独立。
    据新华社17日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时政府在宣布将来让刚果“独立”的欺骗性计划的同时，正打算增派军队前往镇压刚果人民反殖民主义的斗争。
    据路透社记者自布鲁塞尔报道，“通常消息灵通人士”16日晚间说，比利时国防部正在考虑派遣三百名“镇压暴乱部队”去帮助守卫在比属刚果的三个军事基地。
