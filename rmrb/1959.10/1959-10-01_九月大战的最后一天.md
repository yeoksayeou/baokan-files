The Last Day of the Great September Battle
Our Shanghai Correspondent

This is the last day of the Great September Battle.

Shanghai is radiant and filled with jubilation. Inspired by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, millions of workers have already completed the third quarter's increased production plan ahead of schedule and are welcoming the fourth quarter with unprecedented momentum.

The steelworkers of the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant are seizing this golden moment to increase the production of steel ingots and greet the great festival.

The workers of the Youth Steelmaking Team heard as soon as they arrived at work in the morning that Crane No. 4 was to be overhauled today. Usually, when Crane No. 4 stops, Crane No. 5 next to it cannot move. The workers were very anxious when they encountered this situation today. Kong Lingen, the steelmaking section chief who had just returned from convalescence in the Soviet Union, and other workers decided to immediately take measures to strengthen cooperation with the crane, stop one of the smaller furnaces to reduce the number of crane trips, and make full use of the other two large furnaces to compensate for the output of the small furnace. At 1:00 p.m., the two cranes stopped, and the three cranes on the roof were seen busily pouring steel ingots and hoisting molten iron. Team leader Lu Shimin, crane commander Yuan Maoquan, and others were directing the battle in front of the furnace with great intensity. By 4:00 p.m., when they got off work, the team had still completed 125 tons of steel ingots, maintaining the daily production level.

The nationally famous Yi Shijuan Group of the No. 2 State Cotton Mill was on the last shift of the eight- and nine-month battle today. The women workers were filled with joy and arrived at the workshop an hour early. The girls had prepared their holiday clothes a few days ago and would dress up beautifully to participate in the National Day parade tomorrow. Today, they want to seize every minute to strive to overproduce more cotton yarn.

The twenty-one weft yarns of their group are now running at a speed of 512 revolutions per minute. The spindles are spinning, the machines are singing triumphant songs, and the girls are patrolling back and forth in the alleyways like swallows, quickly piecing the ends together and quickly doffing the bobbins. At a high speed of 512 revolutions per minute, there are only about 100 yarn breaks, which is about the same as when the speed was more than 200 revolutions per minute before the Great Leap Forward last year. Last year, the high-speed movement of Shanghai cotton mills started with this group, but at that time it was only increased to 400 revolutions, and it was obstructed by right-leaning conservative ideas. However, the speed of the twenty-one weft yarns was still 412 revolutions per minute in mid-August, and now it has increased to 512 revolutions per minute. The unit output has increased from 44 kilograms to more than 55 kilograms. In September, the production plan was overfulfilled by 21 pieces of yarn two days ahead of schedule.

Hong Guozhen, the workshop's union chairman and doffing worker, told reporters that they also want to have a "red after the holiday," and the speed will be greatly increased. The output in October will be increased by another 10% compared with September.

She added: "This can definitely be done. When we increased from 200 revolutions to 400 revolutions last year, some people doubted it. Now it is more than 500 revolutions, and life is very easy to do. As long as we work harder, we can definitely go up." Her tone was so firm that it seemed that no force could stop them.

While all industrial fronts are preparing to show their skills for the "red opening" of the holiday, the workers of the Shanghai municipal transportation department are actively rushing to transport sufficient "grain and grass" to the front lines. In the material yards of various transportation industries throughout the city, the yards are empty and people are gathered. More than 1,600 trucks with a total load capacity of 120,000 tons are still dispatched as usual, fully loaded with raw materials such as pig iron, coal, ore, and cotton, shuttling back and forth from stations and docks to factories. Nearly 5,000 three-wheeled tractors have also joined this intense battle. The city's transportation workers have successively launched two surprise transports, and have overfulfilled the third quarter's task three days ahead of schedule.

However, they will never relax on the last day of the third quarter. The workers of Shanghai East Railway Station are determined to transport more than 6,000 tons of raw materials to various factories within 24 hours today. At 6:30 in the morning, many workers who should have left work still did not want to leave their posts, requesting to continue to transport together with the second shift workers; 150 workers who were originally scheduled to rest also gave up their rest and joined this battle.

    九月大战的最后一天
    本报驻上海记者
    这是9月大战的最后一天。
    上海，容光焕发，一片欢腾。百万职工群众在党的八中全会鼓舞下，已经提前完成了第三季度增产计划，正以空前未有的气势，迎接第四季度。
    上钢六厂的炼钢工人们抓紧这黄金般的时刻，增产钢锭，迎接伟大的节日。
    青年炼钢班的工人们，清晨一上班，就听说四号行车今天要检修。通常，四号行车一停，旁边的五号行车就开不过来。今天又碰到这种情况，工人们可急了。刚从苏联休养回国不久的炼钢工段长孔林根等工人，决定马上采取措施和行车加强配合，把三只炉子中产量比较小的一只停下来，减少行车的来回次数，充分利用另外两只大炉子来补小炉子的产量。下午一点钟，两部行车停下来了，只见屋顶上的三部行车在??地浇钢锭，吊铁水，班主任陆士明，行车指挥员袁茂泉等，紧张地指挥着炉前的作战。到下午四点下班时，这个班仍然完成了一百二十五吨钢锭，保持了日产水平。
    国棉二厂全国著名的裔式娟小组，今天担任大战8、9两月的最后一个班。女工们心中充满喜悦，提前一小时来到车间。姑娘们几天前已准备好节日服装，明天要打扮得漂漂亮亮参加国庆游行。今天，她们要抓紧每一分钟时间，争取超产更多的棉纱。
    她们小组的二十一支纬纱，车速现在是五百十二转。锭子在飞转，机器在高奏凯歌，姑娘们像燕子一样，在弄堂里来去巡回，快接头，快落纱。在五百十二转高速下，断头只有一百根左右，同去年大跃进前车速二百多转时差不多。去年大跃进中，上海棉纺厂的高速运动就是从这个小组开始的，但那时只加到四百转，又遭到有右倾保守思想的阻挠。可是，二十一支纬纱车速8月中旬还是四百十二转，现在已增加到五百十二转，单位产量由四十四公斤提高到五十五公斤以上，9月份，提前二天超额二十一件纱完成生产计划。
    车间工会主席落纱工洪国珍对记者说，她们还要来个“节后红”，车速还要大大加上去，10月份产量再比9月份增加10％。
    她又说：“这是肯定可以办到的。去年从二百转加到四百转时，不也有人怀疑，现在五百多转，生活倒很好做，只要再加把力，一定可以上去”。她的语气那么坚决，看来没有任何力量可以阻挡她们。
    当各条工业战线为节日“开门红”准备大显身手的时候，上海市内运输部门的职工，正积极为前线赶运充足的“粮草”。全市各个运输工业原料的车场里，场空人集，总载重量十二万吨的一千六百多辆卡车，仍像往日那样，全部出动，满载着生铁、煤炭、矿石、棉花等原料材料，从车站、码头到工厂，往返奔驰。近五千辆三轮拖车也投入了这场紧张的战斗。全市运输工人接连二次突击运输，已提前三天超额完成了第三季度的任务。
    但是他们决不放松三季度的最后一天，上海东站的职工决心在今天二十四小时内，运出六千多吨原材料给各个工厂。早晨六时半，许多应该下班的工人，仍不想离开岗位。要求继续和第二班的工人一起赶运；原来轮到休息的一百五十个工人也放弃休息，加入了这一战斗的行列。
