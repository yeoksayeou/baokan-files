　　Insect Reflections
　　Hua Jing
    The dung beetle is black all over, slow moving, and short-sighted. For its own benefit, it crawls on dung piles all day long, burrowing in the excrement, getting itself filthy and stinking. Everyone who sees it shakes their head in disgust.
    The bee is not like that. Look at it flying back and forth in the flowers all day long, happily working and singing to its heart's content. It considers the collective cause and is not tormented and saddened all day long for selfish gain. Precisely because its behavior is open and aboveboard, its whole body shines with golden light.

　　昆虫篇
　　华泾
    屎壳螂虫遍体乌黑，行动缓慢，目光短浅，为了自己的利益，成天在粪堆上爬，屎堆里钻，弄得混身脏透，臭气冲天，谁见了都摇头讨厌。
    蜜蜂则不然，你看它成天在花丛里飞来飞去，一边愉快地劳动，一边尽情地歌唱，它考虑的是集体的事业，毫不为私利而终日苦闷忧伤。正由于它的行为光明磊落，因而它全身闪耀出金光。
