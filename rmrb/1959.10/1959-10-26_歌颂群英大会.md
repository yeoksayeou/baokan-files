The National Congress of Advanced Producers of China will open on October 26, 1959, truly fulfilling the proverb "Every profession produces a champion." I composed a poem of seventy-two lines to offer heartfelt praise to the heroes of the congress, heartfelt praise to our motherland, and heartfelt praise to our Party and Chairman Mao. On the twenty-fifth day after the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, advanced producers from all over the country came to Beijing to meet; presenting their hearts to the beloved Party and Chairman Mao, the 20th-century congress of heroes is staging a grand performance.

The heroes are competing in upholding politics, in practicing the general line, in drive, in advancement, in wisdom, in active production, learning from each other, promoting each other, exchanging construction experiences, bearing hardship before enjoyment, and never taking precedence in life. As the saying goes, "Every profession produces a champion," but this is only truly realized today. In the past, there was only one champion, but now there are tens of thousands; the old champions were only versed in literature, but now they are skilled in all trades. The old champions were pale-faced scholars, so-called personally appointed by the emperor; but now they are elected by the people, each one both red and expert. The old champions have been thrown into the great basket of history, but now the heroes are in charge of creating history. There are collectives, individuals, the masses, Party members, Youth League members, men and women, old and young, the cutting edge of the nation. The unrestrained east wind blows all over the world, please see, the grand occasion of letting a hundred flowers bloom is truly unprecedented!

The big family of fifty-two nationalities is harmonious, happy, unified in will, cheerful in spirit, and as vigorous as dragons and tigers. The laboring people have become masters and have grasped state power, integrating economics, politics, culture, and science into one. All-round high tide, all-round soaring, all-round leaping onto rockets, the Great Hall of the People is a good example, already taking the lead. It took only ten months to complete such a magnificent construction, which would take Western countries ten years and still feel difficult. And please look at the Beijing Railway Station, the Nationalities Cultural Palace, and various museums, with rapid construction, magnificent arrangements, everything surpassing description; not only Beijing is like this, but the whole country is also in full swing, with 600 million people united in building a paradise on earth. From the Pamir Plateau in the west to the coast of the East China Sea in the east, from the Nansha Islands in the south to the southern half of Heilongjiang in the north, we will go deep into the underworld, reach the outer space, and comprehensively wage war against the earth and against nature.

We have unparalleled superior conditions objectively, and we have inexhaustible sources of power subjectively. The road is correct, the methods are proper, the leadership is strong and firm, with the collective wisdom and efforts, how could we not turn the vast Gobi Desert into fertile fields? Although there are some yelping dogs of Yao and Jie at home and abroad, their barking only shows their pitifulness. Imperialism is already declining, its breath failing, how can the frost and snow of right-leaning conservatism withstand the raging fire? In another ten years, we will surpass Britain in major production, and the main targets of the Five-Year Plan can be completed within two years. Whoever denies the Great Leap Forward is blind, the sun does not fail to shine brightly in the sky just because a blind man cannot see it!

Think back to our compatriots before liberation, nearly half of the men and women were smoking opium; the whole of China was reduced to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and in the eyes of foreigners, the Chinese were even inferior to dogs! In the Shanghai concessions, there were many foreign parks with signs hanging high at the gate: "Dogs and Chinese not allowed." This shameful situation is gone forever, and when young people hear this, it is more remote than hearing a myth.

Think back to Chiang Kai-shek's rule over China for more than twenty years, he only managed to produce 80,000 tons of steel; he cruelly squeezed the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, fattening the four major families who bought rubber plantations in Brazil. Concentration camps were everywhere, the people's lives were very miserable, which led to the Japanese invaders occupying half of China. This shameful situation is gone forever, and when young people hear this, it is more remote than hearing a myth.

Today, we have two suns appearing at the same time, one is in the sky, and the other is in front of Tiananmen. The sun in the sky warms our divine land of China, and the sun on earth warms the hearts of our 600 million people. Whether we are making large wheels or small screws, we must double our competence, double our conservation and increase production. We must summon up our energy, work hard, work practically, work skillfully, and work selflessly for the communist tomorrow.

    歌颂群英大会
    郭沫若
    1959年10月26日全中国先进生产者群英大会将开幕，真是做到了俗语所说的“七十二行行行出状元”。我因成诗七十二行，向大会的英雄们献出衷心的歌颂，向我们的祖国献出衷心的歌颂，向我们的党和毛主席献出衷心的歌颂。建国十周年纪念后的第二十五天，全国的先进生产者来到北京会面；向亲爱的党和毛主席捧献出心肝，廿世纪的群英会轰轰烈烈地表演。英雄们比政治挂帅，比实践总路线，比干劲，比先进，比智慧，比积极生产，相互学习，相互促进，交流建设经验，吃苦在前，享受在后，生活决不占先。俗语说得好：“七十二行行行出状元”，但这只有在今天才算真正地实现。旧状元只有一名，而今是数万数千；旧状元只通翰墨，而今是各业俱全。旧状元是白面书生，所谓御笔亲点；而今是人民选举，一个个又红又专。旧状元已被抛进了历史的大网篮，而今是英雄人物，执掌历史创造权。有集体，有个人，有群众，有党员团员，有男有女，有老有少，有民族的尖端，骀宕的东风把九天四海一律吹遍，请看呵，百花齐放的盛况真是空前！五十二个民族的大家庭和谐，美满，意志统一，心情舒畅，生龙活虎一般。劳动人民作了主，掌握了国家政权，把经济、政治、文化、科学打成了一片。全面高涨，全面腾骧，全面跨上火箭，大会堂就是好榜样，已经着了先鞭。十个月完成了这样个雄伟的基建，西方国家就费上十年也感觉困难。更请看北京站、民族宫、各种博物馆，建筑迅速，布置富丽，样样超绝言筌；不仅北京如此，全国都是热火朝天，六亿人民齐心地建设着地上乐园。西至帕米尔高原，东至东海的沿岸，南至南沙群岛，北至黑龙江的南半，要深入地底黄泉，要高到外层空间，要全面地向地球开战，向自然开战。我们在客观上有无比的优越条件，我们在主观上有无穷的力量泉源，道路正确，方法妥善，领导又强又坚，群策群力，岂仅把大戈壁化为良田？国内和国外尽管有一些吠尧桀犬，它们的狂吠只表现了它们的可怜。帝国主义已是日薄西山，气息奄奄，右倾保守的霜雪怎敌得大火燎原？再隔十年将超过英国的主要生产，五年的主要指标两年内便可做完。谁要否认大跃进，那是它瞎了两眼，太阳，不因盲人不见，而非灿烂在天！试回想我们的同胞们在解放以前，差不多有一半的男女在抽吸鸦片；全中国沦陷成了半殖民地半封建，在外人的眼里中国人甚至不如犬！上海租界内有不少的外国的公园，“狗与华人禁止入内”高挂在门外边。这可耻的境遇呵已经一去不复返，少年们听此，比听说神话还要辽远。试回想蒋介石统治中国二十几年，他只搞到钢产量八万吨零一点点；残酷地榨取了中国人民的血和汗，养肥了四大家族在巴西买橡胶园。到处是集中营，人民生活十分悲惨，引来日寇的侵略，把中国占了一半。这可耻的境遇呵已经一去不复返，少年们听此，比听说神话还要辽远。在今天我们有两个太阳同时出现，一个是在天上，一个是在天安门前。天上的太阳照暖我们的神州赤县，地上的太阳照暖我们的六亿心田。不管是做大车轮，还是做小螺蛳钻，我们定要加倍称职，加倍节约增产。我们定要鼓足干劲，苦干，实干，巧干，忘我地劳动，为了共产主义的明天。
