　　Rare Cotton

　　The 4,000 plants of "Linqing Leap Forward No. 1 Cotton" cultivated by the Youth Experimental Field of the Guyou Production Team in the Guyou People's Commune of Linqing City, Shandong Province, bear an average of 160 to 170 bolls per plant, with plant heights all around five chi (approximately 1.67 meters).

　　After careful cultivation, this excellent cotton preliminarily shows that it is not only tall, with large leaves, dense branches, and many bolls, but also resists boll shedding, has a long growing period, and is highly disease-resistant.

　　This year, the members of the Youth Experimental Field are also conducting hybridization experiments with this cotton and another long-staple cotton called "May 1st Big Boll Cotton" to further improve the variety. (Attached picture)

　　罕见的棉花
    山东临清市古柚人民公社古柚生产队青年试验场培植的四千株“临清跃进一号棉”，平均每株结桃一百六十至一百七十个，株高都在五尺左右。
    这种优良棉花，经过精心培植，初步可以看出它不仅株高、叶大、枝密、结桃多，而且不落铃、生长期长、抗病力强。
    青年试验场的社员今年又用这种棉花与另一种棉絮长的“五一大铃棉”进行杂交试验，以便进一步改良品种。（附图片）
