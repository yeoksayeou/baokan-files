    Shaanxi's Great Steel Campaign Solves Major Problems
    Mechanical Industry's Raw Material of Pig Iron Entirely Self-Sufficient

    (Our Dispatch) Guided by the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small-scale industries and combining indigenous and foreign methods, Shaanxi Province, which was originally devoid of iron and steel, has, after vigorously developing the steel industry, ensured that the entire province's mechanical industry, excluding state-owned industries, does not require a single ton of pig iron allocated by the state; instead, it produces a large amount of mechanical equipment using the province's own indigenous iron. According to incomplete statistics, from January to August, the province produced a total of 2,376 tons of various heavy-duty equipment, more than 780 metal-cutting machine tools and forging equipment, more than 5,406 electric motors (over 200,000 kilowatts), 2,398 transformers (67,380 kilovolt-amperes), and more than 2,000 various agricultural machines. It also produced a large number of light industrial machines, transportation machines, auto parts, farm tools, etc. These equipment, in addition to meeting the needs of the province, were also transferred to other regions, playing a significant role in supporting industrial and agricultural production.

    In order to ensure that the steel produced in the province is used for production and to eliminate the need to request pig iron allocation from the state, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, starting from the fourth quarter of last year, organized technical personnel and scientific research departments in the mechanical industry system to jointly study the use of indigenous iron to cast qualified mechanical parts. By the second quarter of this year, the majority of mechanical factories in the province had mastered the technology of casting using indigenous iron. Now, the casters in Shaanxi Province are able to use indigenous iron to produce various castings for ironmaking blast furnaces, steel rolling equipment, and mining equipment, as well as various equipment such as lathes, punch presses, and air hammers, and auto parts such as cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and cylinder liners, which require high quality.

    While renovating indigenous blast furnaces, Shaanxi Province is also planning and building a batch of medium-sized and small foreign-style blast furnaces and steelmaking converters. By the end of this year, the province will have iron plants with a production capacity of 100,000 tons, steel plants with a production capacity of 60,000 tons, and steel pipe plants with a production capacity of 50,000 tons, as well as corresponding mining plants, coking plants, and refractory material plants.

### 陕西大办钢铁解决了大问题  机械工业生铁原料全部自给

    陕西大办钢铁解决了大问题
    机械工业生铁原料全部自给
    本报讯　在大中小并举，土法生产和洋法生产并举的方针指导下，原来手无寸铁的陕西省，大办钢铁以后，全省机械工业除国营工业外，没有要国家调拨一吨生铁，全部用本省的土铁制造出大量机械设备。据不完全统计，1至8月份全省共生产出各种重型设备二千三百七十六吨，金属切削机床和锻压设备等共七百八十多台电动机五千四百零六台（二十多万瓩），变压器二千三百九十八台，（六万七千三百八十千伏），各种农业机械二千多台，还生产了很多轻工机械、运输机械、汽车配件、农具等。这些设备除供应本省需要外，还有不少调往其他地区，对支援工农业生产起了很大作用。
    中共陕西省委为了使本省生产的钢铁都能用到生产上去，不再伸手向国家要求调拨生铁，从去年第四季度开始，就组织机械工业系统的技术人员和科学研究部门共同研究利用土铁铸造合格的机械零件。到今年第二季度，全省多数机械厂已经熟练地掌握了利用土铁铸造的技术。现在陕西省的铸工们已能用土铁生产炼铁高炉、轧钢设备、矿山设备上的各种铸件，也能生产车床、冲床、空气锤等各种设备，和生产质量要求较高的汽缸体、汽缸盖和汽缸套等汽车配件。
  陕西省还在改造土高炉的同时，有计划地新建设了一批中、小型的洋高炉和炼钢转炉，到今年年底，全省将拥有生产能力十万吨的铁厂，六万吨的钢厂，五万吨的钢管厂，还有与此相适应的采矿厂、炼焦厂、耐火材料厂等。（李茜）（附图片）
