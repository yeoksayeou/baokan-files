Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The noble Communist style has promoted the high-speed construction of the electric power industry. Due to the large-scale Communist collaboration in the national electric power industry, nearly 400,000 kilowatts of power generating equipment were put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule in August and September, despite the fact that some equipment and materials could not be supplied in time.

    This year, China's electric power industry is advancing by leaps and bounds at a pace far exceeding last year's Great Leap Forward. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the call to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, increase enthusiasm, and practice increased production and thrift, the construction speed of the electric power industry has soared even faster. The installed capacity completed in September alone reached 550,000 kilowatts, more than the total completed in the first half of this year, and equal to the total for the first two years of the First Five-Year Plan period. With the great acceleration of capital construction, some equipment could not be supplied in time or ahead of schedule. Thanks to the large-scale Communist collaboration among the relevant units of the national electric power industry's capital construction, mutual adjustment and mutual support, these difficulties were overcome. In order to solve the urgent need for equipment and materials for the construction of thermal power plants in Liaoning Province, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee Secretary personally convened a meeting of the Directors of the Materials Bureau, the Director of the Commerce Department, and the managers of hardware, electrical, and other companies, and allocated them on the spot. The responsible person of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee personally grasped the progress of the Wujing Power Plant project, and organized seventeen units to support the Wujing Power Plant with the missing equipment and materials, greatly accelerating the progress of the Wujing Power Plant. The Wangting Power Plant in Jiangsu Province was unable to transmit electricity after its generator set was put into production because the arrival time of the transformer was delayed. At this time, the transformer ordered by the Miyun Power Plant, which was not yet generating electricity this year, was first transferred to the Wangting Power Plant. When the Beijing Thermal Power Plant was installing a 100,000-kilowatt unit, an important part malfunctioned. At this time, the Jilin Thermal Power Plant, whose completion date was later than that of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, immediately sent someone to Beijing with the same part from its own unit, so that the 100,000-kilowatt unit of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant was put into production before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. At the same time, the Northeast power departments also transferred a batch of valves, water pumps, motors, etc. used in power plants to support the power plant projects in Guangxi, Jiangxi, Beijing and other places. Gansu, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia also transferred a batch of equipment used in power plants to support the power plant projects in the Northeast region. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, in August and September, the national electric power industry construction departments, through large-scale Communist collaboration, mutually adjusted and mutually supported more than 2,000 pieces of equipment and more than 6,000 tons of special materials, overcoming the difficulties that some equipment and materials could not be supplied in time, thus enabling nearly 400,000 kilowatts of power generating equipment to be put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule. Recently, when the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power balanced the power generating equipment and materials in the fourth quarter, Shandong, Gansu, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei and other provinces and cities all took out the equipment they were not using temporarily for unified allocation throughout the country, solving the shortage of some equipment and materials for many projects across the country in the fourth quarter. Among them, the porcelain insulators transferred by the Changchun No. 17 Engineering Office alone can meet the urgent need for power generation of 400,000 kilowatt units across the country in October.

    The Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power believes that under the guidance of the national unified plan, under the leadership of the Party committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and with the great emphasis on Communist style and large-scale Communist collaboration in the construction of the electric power industry, it is an important guarantee for implementing the Party's general line and building China's electric power industry in a faster, better and more economical way.

### 发扬共产主义风格　加快电站建设速度  电力工业大兴协作之风  九月份装机容量五十五万瓩超过上半年的总和

    发扬共产主义风格　加快电站建设速度
    电力工业大兴协作之风
    九月份装机容量五十五万瓩超过上半年的总和
    据新华社28日讯　高尚的共产主义风格促进了电力工业高速度的建设。全国电力工业由于大搞共产主义协作，8、9月份在某些设备和器材不能及时供应的情况下，有将近四十万瓩的发电设备按期或提前投入了生产。
    我国电力工业今年正以大大超过去年大跃进的速度向前突飞猛进；特别在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的号召发出以后，电力工业的建设速度更像插上了翅膀，9月份一个月完成的装机容量就达五十五万瓩，比今年上半年完成的总数还多，等于第一个五年计划期间前两年的总和。在基本建设大大加快的情况下，有些设备不能及时或提前供应，由于全国电力工业基本建设的有关单位大搞共产主义协作，相互调剂、相互支援，克服了这些困难。中共辽宁省委为解决在本省建设火力电站工程急需的器材问题，省委书记亲自召集物资管理局长、商业厅长和五金、交电等公司经理会议，当场调拨。上海市人民委员会负责人亲自掌握吴泾电厂的工程进度，并且组织了十七个单位支援吴泾电厂所缺少的设备和器材，大大加快了吴泾电厂的进度。江苏省的望亭电厂由于变压器到货时间推迟，发电机组投入了生产，可是送不出电。这时，今年还不发电的密云电厂订的变压器，就先调给了望亭电厂。北京热电厂在安装十万瓩机组时，一个重要零件出了毛病；这时，竣工期比北京热电厂较晚的吉林热电厂，就把本厂同样机组的这一零件，立即派人送到北京，使北京热电厂的十万瓩机组在建国十周年前夕投入生产。与此同时，东北各电业部门，还调出了一批发电厂用的阀门、水泵、电动机等，支援了广西、江西、北京等地的电站工程。甘肃、陕西、内蒙古也调出了一批电站用的设备，支援了东北地区的电站工程。根据水利电力工业部不完全的统计，8、9月份全国电力工业建设部门通过大搞共产主义协作，相互调剂、相互支援了两千多件设备和六千多吨特殊器材，克服了某些设备和器材不能及时供应的困难，因而使将近四十万瓩的发电设备能够按期或提前投入了生产。最近水利电力工业部在平衡第四季度发电设备和器材时，山东、甘肃、辽宁、吉林、河北等省市，都把自己暂时不用的设备拿出来供全国统一调配，解决了第四季度全国很多工程所缺的某些设备和器材。其中只是长春第十七工程处调出来的磁瓶，就可以满足10月份全国四十万瓩机组发电的急需。
    水利电力工业部认为，在全国一盘棋的方针下，在各省、市和自治区党委的领导下，在电力工业的建设中大讲共产主义风格，大搞共产主义协作，是贯彻执行党的总路线、多快好省地建设我国电力工业的一项重要保证。
