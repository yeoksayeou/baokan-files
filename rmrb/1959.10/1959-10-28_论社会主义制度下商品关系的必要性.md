On the Necessity of Commodity Relations Under the Socialist System
Xu Dixing

I. The Victory of the Three Major Transformations Changed
the Content of Commodity Relations in Our Country

Before the high tide of socialist transformation in 1956, China had a new democratic economy with multiple components, including capitalist, individual, and socialist economies. This situation clearly demonstrates the inevitability and necessity of commodity relations in our country.

We know that capitalist production is the highest form of commodity production in history. Capitalists not only own the means of production and consumer goods, but also purchase laborers' labor power in the form of commodities, and sell the products produced by laborers for them in the production process in the form of commodities, realizing the surplus value they exploit in the production process. That is to say, the capitalist mode of production takes commodity relations as a prerequisite. Without commodity relations, capitalists would not be able to solve the problem of purchasing labor power and means of production, nor would they be able to solve the problem of selling their products and realizing the surplus value they exploited from laborers in the production process. Before the realization of joint state-private ownership in all industries in China, the private capitalist economy still maintained this characteristic. Therefore, the state's utilization, restriction, and transformation of them were carried out through commodity relations. In the form of purchase and order, industrial capitalists purchased raw materials from the market and labor power from workers, and sold the products of workers' labor to the state-owned economy as commodities. In the form of processing, although industrial capitalists did not purchase major raw materials from the market, labor power and minor raw materials were still purchased in the form of commodities. Although they did not sell the processed products to the state, the "processing fees" they received from the state were still based on commodity relations as a prerequisite. In joint state-private enterprises implementing the "four horses split the fat" system, capitalists still had partial ownership of the means of production, and private dividends were directly related to the growth of enterprise profits. Therefore, joint state-private enterprises did not completely belong to the same owner as the state-owned economy. Under these circumstances, the economic connection between the state-owned economy and joint state-private enterprises was still carried out through commodity relations, that is, through processing and ordering.

Individual handicraftsmen and individual farmers are basically independent producers who own the means of production. They use their own labor power and their own means of production to carry out production, so they have the right to dispose of their own products. However, their production cannot fully meet their own consumption. In order to meet their needs, they must exchange their products with the products of others. That is to say, their products must take the form of commodities. Engels said: "In a society where spontaneous (without any planning, gradually generated) social division of labor is the basic form of production, this division of labor inevitably makes products take the form of commodities. The mutual exchange and buying and selling of commodities make it possible for individual producers to meet all kinds of different needs." Before the realization of agricultural and handicraft cooperation in China, the production of individual farmers and handicraftsmen was basically based on commodity exchange as a prerequisite; the state's leadership over them in the economic field was also carried out in the form of commodity relations. The state exchanged agricultural tools, fertilizers, daily necessities, etc., produced by state-owned industries and processed and ordered from capitalist enterprises with farmers' agricultural products. This situation proves that there is a commodity relationship between the state and the farmers; at the same time, it also shows that the state is using this commodity relationship to realize its leadership over the vast number of farmers in the economic field.

After the state's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce achieved a decisive victory in 1956, the multi-component new democratic economy basically completed the transition to a socialist economy, and the socialist economy based on public ownership by the whole people and collective ownership occupied a dominant position in the national economy. However, the economic basis of commodity relations still exists. This can be examined from the economic connection between the state-owned economy and the collective economy, the economic connection between collective economies, the economic connection between state-owned enterprises, and the relationship between the state and consumers.

II. Commodity Relations Between the State-Owned Economy and the Collective Economy

Under the conditions in our country, industrial production is mainly operated by state-owned enterprises under public ownership by the whole people, while agricultural production is mainly operated by people's communes under collective ownership. Between industry and agriculture, and between cities and the countryside, there is a socialist division of labor and cooperation relationship of mutual dependence and mutual support. In order to supply the needs of urban residents and industry, the state must obtain grain and other cash crops from the people's communes. In order to meet the needs of rural people's lives and agricultural production, the people's communes must obtain industrial daily necessities, agricultural tools, and agricultural fertilizers from state-owned enterprises. Only in this way can socialist industry and socialist agriculture smoothly and continuously carry out expanded reproduction. The question now is: In what way do we realize this mutually supportive economic connection between socialist industry and socialist agriculture?

At the present stage in our country, the state cannot adopt the method of direct allocation to handle the economic connection between socialist industry and socialist agriculture with respect to the products of the people's communes. The means of production of the people's communes are still under collective ownership. Collective ownership is also a form of socialist public ownership, but its means of production and products belong only to the members of a certain collective, and not to the entire people. If the state now adopts the method of direct allocation for the products of the people's communes, in essence, it denies the collective ownership of the means of production of the people's communes and treats them the same as state-owned enterprises under public ownership by the whole people. According to the current level of productivity and the political consciousness of the peasant masses in our country, this is obviously inappropriate.

At the present stage in our country, since the state cannot adopt the method of direct allocation to handle the problem of economic connection between industry and agriculture and between cities and the countryside, it can only adopt the form of commodity exchange to handle this problem. Under this method, on the principle of equivalent value, the state-owned economy and the collective economy each exchange their own products for the other's products, and both sides can obtain the benefits they deserve from the exchange. This method is most likely to be supported by the broad masses of peasants at the present stage. Of course, the commodity relations between the two forms of ownership of the means of production under the socialist system are different in nature from the commodity relations under private ownership. Under the private system, the means of production and consumer goods are the products of independent private labor that do not depend on each other; while under the socialist system, the means of production and consumer goods are no longer the products of independent private labor. If they do not belong to the state-owned enterprises under public ownership by the whole people, they belong to the people's communes under collective ownership. However, from the perspective of the transfer of product ownership, the commodity relations between the two forms of socialist ownership have similarities with the commodity relations under private ownership to a certain extent. Because the state-owned enterprises under public ownership by the whole people and the people's communes under collective ownership are different owners of the means of production and products within the scope of socialism, this makes commodity production and commodity exchange the only form for them to realize economic connection. Stalin once said: "This situation (referring to the coexistence of public ownership by the whole people and collective ownership - editor's note) makes it possible for the state to only dispose of the products of state-owned enterprises. As for the products of collective farms, only collective farms can dispose of them as their own property. However, collective farms are only willing to transfer their products in the form of commodities, and are willing to exchange these commodities for the commodities they need. At present, collective farms cannot accept any other economic connection with cities except through commodity relations and through buying and selling exchanges. Therefore, commodity production and commodity circulation are still necessary things in our country (referring to the Soviet Union - editor's note), just like about thirty years ago when Lenin announced that commodity circulation must be expanded with all efforts." I think it is appropriate to use Stalin's words to explain the necessity of commodity relations between the two forms of public ownership of the means of production in the current stage of our country's socialism.

Facts have proved that under the current conditions in our country, only through the method of commodity exchange can the state-owned economy under public ownership by the whole people be smoothly connected with the people's communes under collective ownership in the economic field, can cities and the countryside be smoothly and closely connected, and can socialist industry and socialist agriculture be closely connected, and the state-owned economy's leadership over the people's communes in the economic field be realized here. This is conducive to the high-speed development of our country's national economy and socialist construction; conducive to the development of the rural commune economy and encouraging the production enthusiasm of the working people in the collective ownership economy; conducive to further improving and raising the material life of the broad masses of working people, thereby conducive to further consolidating our country's worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, we can say that at the present stage in our country, developing commodity production and commodity exchange between public ownership by the whole people and collective ownership is essentially a matter of the working class uniting the 500 million peasant masses, and a matter of the working class further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

Some comrades once believed that rural people's communes in our country contain elements of public ownership by the whole people and will transition from collective ownership to public ownership by the whole people in the future. Therefore, they neglected the necessity of commodity exchange in the problem of economic connection between the state-owned economy and the people's communes. This understanding does not conform to objective facts. Although the current people's communes have elements of public ownership by the whole people, the ownership of the means of production of the communes is basically collective, and they still need a process to transition from collective ownership to public ownership by the whole people. Therefore, this recognition of underestimating commodity relations is not conducive to correctly handling the economic connection between cities and the countryside and between socialist industry and socialist agriculture, and is not conducive to further consolidating our country's worker-peasant alliance.

III. Commodity Relations Between Collective Economies

From the perspective of collective ownership, commodity relations not only exist between people's communes and the state-owned economy, but also exist between communes and communes, and within communes, that is, between communes and production teams, and between production teams and production teams, that is, between various collective owners.

The scope of the public ownership of the means of production under collective ownership is limited to a certain collective. Units or individuals outside this collective cannot own its means of production and products. That is to say, between collectives, they are different owners of the means of production and products, and they can only carry out economic connection through commodity exchange.

At present, the means of production of people's communes are not completely owned by the commune. In addition to the part directly owned by the commune, there is also the ownership of production teams and production sub-teams. Here, the ownership of the production team (in some places it is the production brigade, in short, roughly equivalent to the original advanced agricultural production cooperative) is the basic ownership in the commune. Because the current commune ownership is still partial, basically the ownership of the production team, and the production sub-team also has partial ownership. Because the commune implements a three-level management and three-level accounting system, the transfer of materials and products within the commune (that is, between the commune and the production team), in addition to the part that should be turned over according to regulations, such as state agricultural taxes, the commune's public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund, cannot be carried out through direct allocation, but must be carried out through commodity relations and through commodity exchange.

At present, the economic situation of each production team is different. Some production teams are relatively rich; some production teams are relatively poor. Between rich teams and poor teams, on the one hand, the spirit of communist cooperation and mutual assistance should of course be promoted, but more importantly, the socialist principle of distribution according to work should be implemented, that is to say, production teams and production teams should implement equivalent exchange through commodity relations. In this way, production teams and their members who work more and better can obtain more and higher labor remuneration, so that their production enthusiasm can be better mobilized.

In addition to participating in labor in the production team and distributing according to work, commune members also engage in some household sideline production on their own private plots, such as vegetables, poultry, eggs, and small handicraft products. These things belong to them personally. If the ownership of these agricultural and sideline products produced by individuals is to be transferred, it can only be carried out through commodity exchange. This can promote the enthusiasm of the broad masses for sideline production.

The current situation of this basic team ownership and partial commune ownership of the people's commune is basically based on the current level of agricultural production in our country as a prerequisite. Agricultural production in our country is still dominated by manual operation, animal power cultivation, and the use of natural fertilizers. Therefore, products are not very abundant; the economic strength of the commune itself is not strong; and the level of economic development of each production team cannot be balanced. With the improvement of the level of agricultural production, with the strengthening of the economic strength of the commune itself, with the gradual balancing of the development level of each production team, and with the further improvement of the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses, this incomplete commune ownership will gradually be changed to basically commune ownership, realizing the system of unified calculation of profits and losses and unified distribution of the entire commune, with the commune as the basic accounting unit. However, it takes a certain amount of time to complete this process. Even at that time, the production team may still be a first-level accounting unit within the commune, and still maintain the partial ownership of the team. In this way, commodity relations within the commune may be reduced because of the realization of the unified calculation of profits and losses and the unified distribution of the entire commune; but it will not be completely abolished because of this.

In the early days of the establishment of rural people's communes, some comrades believed that commodity production and commodity exchange in our country would soon be reduced or even "abolished." The reasons they put forward were: the people's commune is a diversified and comprehensive economy. It not only manages agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, but also manages industry; it can not only produce the means of livelihood needed by the members, but also produce the means of production needed by the commune itself. Since the commune is a self-sufficient economic unit, the goods it needs can soon be produced and used by itself, so why should it engage in commodity exchange with the outside world? Within the commune, the implementation and gradual expansion of the supply system allows hundreds of millions of farmers to directly receive consumer goods from the commune. This has rapidly reduced and abolished commodity relations within the commune. This view does not conform to objective facts.

First, rural people's communes are indeed diversified and comprehensive economies. They can produce more goods than agricultural production cooperatives to meet the needs of the commune in production and the needs of members in consumption. However, we cannot draw the conclusion that the people's commune is an "independent" and "self-sufficient" "small kingdom" because of this. Because: (1) The diversification of the commune not only does not exclude commodity exchange, but also requires more commodity exchange. The commune's industry is only some small industries that serve agriculture and process agricultural products. They cannot manufacture all the means of production. In order to develop various productions, in order to realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, the commune needs to obtain more means of production from the state (such as tractors, combines, trucks, fertilizers, and various agricultural tools, etc.) and means of livelihood (such as fabrics, radios, and other daily industrial products, etc.). (2) The natural conditions and historical conditions of people's communes in various places are not exactly the same. They have more or less some local specialties. The commune itself may not need much or need these specialties. For the needs of the state and other communes, the commune cannot but carry out the production of these specialties. To produce these things that it does not need or needs very little, there will inevitably be the problem of external exchange. (3) With the development of production, self-produced and self-sufficient products will inevitably exceed the needs of the commune itself, which requires it to exchange with the state and other communes. At the same time, with the gradual improvement of the living standards of the members, their needs will become more and more complex. Increasingly complex needs cannot be met by the production of the commune itself. This requires the commune to continuously purchase goods from the state and other communes that it cannot produce or whose output is insufficient. Facts have proved that the idea and practice of considering the people's commune as a self-sufficient "independent kingdom" does not conform to objective facts.

Second, in addition to the goods consumed by themselves (such as sideline foods produced from private plots), a part of the products of the people's commune are distributed in the form of a supply system (such as grain), and a part are distributed in the form of wages. In the current distribution system of the commune, wages are still the main part. Members receive wages and have to take them to buy commodities; if some supplied goods are paid in cash, they also have to take the cash to buy commodities.

Therefore, commodity relations within the commune will inevitably exist before the realization of basically commune ownership. Even after the realization of basically commune ownership, due to the existence of partial team ownership, commodity relations within the commune will not be completely "abolished." In the future, when rural people's communes all transition to public ownership by the whole people, socialist industry and socialist agriculture will no longer be different owners of the means of production and products. Will their economic connection still be carried out through commodity exchange? For this question, we can examine the methods currently adopted for the economic connection between state-owned enterprises.

IV. Commodity Relations Between State-Owned Enterprises

At the present stage, the economic connection between state-owned enterprises is carried out under the conditions of the coexistence of two forms of socialist ownership. Therefore, some people believe that if the transfer of consumer goods and means of production between the state-owned economy and the collective economy needs to be carried out through commodity exchange, then the goods produced by socialist state-owned enterprises must have the form of commodities, because in the process of socialist expanded reproduction, it is impossible for several different economic categories to be in effect at the same time. This view has a certain basis. However, it only explains the commodity relations between state-owned enterprises from external factors, and fails to explain this problem from the inside of public ownership by the whole people.

As mentioned above, between state-owned enterprises and people's communes, between communes and communes, and between production teams and production teams, because they are different owners of the means of production and products, the transfer of materials between them cannot be directly allocated by the state or the commune; while between state-owned enterprises, this problem does not exist. State-owned enterprises are all enterprises under public ownership by the whole people. Their relationship is not the relationship between different owners of the means of production and products. Therefore, the state representing the entire people has the power to directly allocate their products according to the plan. At present, some important means of production manufactured by state-owned heavy industry in our country, such as heavy machinery, locomotives, ships, trucks, airplanes, steel and steel products, etc., are not bought and sold through the market, but are directly allocated by the state according to the plan. After the production of these important materials, the enterprises producing these important materials hand them over to the users according to the state plan. The relationship between the production unit and the user unit is obviously a product allocation relationship, and a product distribution relationship within public ownership by the whole people, because the transfer of these materials does not involve the problem of ownership transfer, nor does it go through the market buying and selling method.

However, these important means of production directly allocated by the state between state-owned enterprises are to be evaluated. "Evaluation" makes these allocated materials have the form of commodities. Why are these allocated materials "evaluated"? This is because state-owned enterprises implement economic accounting. Economic accounting means that state-owned enterprises are materially responsible to the state in terms of completing state plans, rationally using resources, continuously improving labor productivity, and reducing production costs; it also means that they are materially responsible to other state-owned enterprises for fulfilling their obligations. This situation makes state-owned enterprises have relative independence in economic and business aspects. Of course, the independence of state-owned enterprises is different in nature from the independence of collective ownership economic units or enterprises. Collective ownership of the means of production makes cooperatives, people's communes, or production teams have the independence to treat each other as equals with state-owned enterprises or other collective enterprises, while the economic and business independence of state-owned enterprises is realized within the scope of public ownership of the means of production by the whole people. The means of production handed over to a certain enterprise for use still belong to the socialist state. Therefore, the state has the power to directly allocate their products. However, the economic and business independence derived from the implementation of economic accounting makes state-owned enterprises responsible for profits and losses and responsible for doing a good job in production and operation. In order to calculate profits and losses and to supervise and urge the production and operation of enterprises, those materials directly allocated by the state cannot but use the value form to carry out "evaluation". These materials directly allocated by the state between state-owned enterprises have a relationship of unity of opposites in form and content. Economic accounting makes it necessary for us to use the old form (commodity value) to serve the new content (product allocation), and to combine the form of commodity value with the content of product allocation.

The products produced by each state-owned enterprise, which are produced and allocated uniformly by the state, are only a part of them; for the remaining parts, because the varieties are complex, at the present stage, the state does not need and cannot directly and uniformly allocate them. Therefore, the transfer of these materials between state-owned enterprises can only be carried out through the market buying and selling method. Facts have proved that it is a good way for the state to use commodities, currency, and value forms to distribute these products that are not needed or impossible to directly allocate between state-owned enterprises at the present stage. This method flexibly adapts to the characteristics of these complex varieties of materials and the needs of the users, so that we can use less time and labor to deal with their distribution problems. Because these products are bought and sold through the market, they have a more definite commodity form than the products directly allocated by the state; because they are bought and sold through the market, the state-owned enterprises participating in the buying and selling obviously have a commodity exchange relationship with each other. However, this commodity relationship between state-owned enterprises is different in nature from the commodity relationship between state-owned enterprises and people's communes, and between communes and communes. This commodity relationship between state-owned enterprises is not an exchange relationship between different owners of the means of production and products, but a way for the state to use commodities, currency, and value forms to realize product distribution.

Some comrades completely oppose the form of commodity exchange between state-owned enterprises and the content of product distribution. Some people believe that since the commodity exchange between state-owned enterprises does not involve the problem of ownership transfer and has the content of product distribution, there is no problem of commodity form. Therefore, they ignore the necessity of using commodities, currency, and value forms within public ownership by the whole people. Some people, based on the fact that these materials between state-owned enterprises are bought and sold through the market, ignore that their exchange has a new content of product distribution within the nature of public ownership by the whole people. I think these views are not comprehensive enough.

Since it is still necessary to use commodities and value forms to carry out economic accounting for those state-owned enterprise products directly allocated by the state, then it is even more necessary to use commodities and value forms to carry out economic accounting for those state-owned enterprise products bought and sold through the market. The relative economic and business independence of state-owned enterprises implementing economic accounting is more significant in the case of products bought and sold through the market than in the case of products directly allocated by the state. It can be seen that the implementation of economic accounting by state-owned enterprises and their economic and business independence makes it necessary for the state to use the form of commodity value to realize the distribution of products between them.

V. Commodity Relations Between the State and Consumers

The state sells consumer goods produced by state-owned enterprises and consumer goods purchased from people's communes to consumers such as workers and staff members of enterprises, institutions, and schools through market relations. Here, there is also a commodity relationship between the state and thousands of consumers. The characteristic of this commodity relationship is that there is no exchange of commodities for commodities, but only an exchange of money for commodities. Consumers use money to exchange for commodities provided by the state. Consumers are buyers; and the state-owned stores of the state are sellers.

In the commodity relationship between the state and consumers, the consumer's money, generally speaking, is the wage they earn from their labor. Can it be said that their purchase of commodities from state-owned stores is essentially an exchange of labor for commodities? I think this statement is worth considering. The labor of employees in socialist state-owned enterprises is based on the public ownership of the means of production by the whole people. Under the conditions of public ownership by the whole people, the working masses and the people of the whole country jointly own the means of production. They are laborers and masters of the means of production. Therefore, there is no fact that the working masses hire themselves and sell their labor power to themselves. In this case, how can we say that they exchange their labor for the state's consumer goods?

Can the commodity relationship between the state and consumers be understood as an exchange relationship between public ownership by the whole people of the means of production and personal ownership of consumer goods? From the perspective of the ownership of consumer goods, after buying and selling, the commodities do change from state ownership to personal ownership. After consumers obtain commodities, they have the right to dispose of them. However, it is worth considering to oppose the public ownership of the means of production by the whole people to the personal ownership of consumer goods. Under the conditions of the socialist state-owned economy, the personal ownership of consumer goods is based on the public ownership of the means of production by the whole people. It is included in the socialist production relations based on the public ownership of the means of production by the whole people. This is the distribution relationship under the conditions of public ownership by the whole people. If the public ownership of the means of production by the whole people is completely opposed to the personal ownership of consumer goods, in essence, it denies the share of individuals in the public ownership of the means of production and products by the whole people, and opposes the public ownership of the means of production by the whole people to the distribution relationship based on public ownership by the whole people. This is not very appropriate.

This commodity relationship between the state and consumers is essentially a way for the state to distribute consumer goods among the working masses and staff members of enterprises, institutions, and schools. In the socialist period, because the level of social productive forces is not high enough, the products of society have not reached an extremely abundant level, because labor has not become the first need of life for every member of society like in communist society, and because there are still differences between mental labor and physical labor, and between skilled labor and simple labor, therefore, the distribution of consumer goods among members of society cannot realize the principle of distribution according to need, but can only implement the principle of distribution according to work. Under this situation, in addition to continuously improving the socialist consciousness of the working people, implementing the principle of distribution according to work, and making workers materially concerned about their labor results to a certain extent, is an extremely important condition for the development of socialist production. At present, when commodity relations become the only form of economic connection between the two forms of socialist ownership, when it is still necessary to use the form of commodity currency for the economic connection between state-owned enterprises, labor consumption cannot be directly calculated using labor time, but must use the form of commodity currency. Experience has proved that in the socialist stage, the form of commodity currency is a relatively good form for implementing the principle of distribution according to work. Using the form of commodity currency to realize the distribution of consumer goods can flexibly adapt to the different needs and different preferences of each person. Experience has proved that under the current conditions, it is inconceivable to take the method of directly distributing goods in kind for the vast majority of consumer goods of members of society without going through the form of commodity currency.

Under the system of distribution according to work, the commodity relationship between the state and consumers essentially contains a socialist distribution relationship. Here, there is also a relationship of unity of opposites between the form of commodity relations and the content of distribution relations. Some comrades only grasp the essence of the state distributing consumer goods among members of society, and ignore the necessity of using the form of commodity currency to realize this distribution relationship; some comrades, due to overemphasizing the form of commodity currency, ignore the content of the socialist distribution relationship. These are all not comprehensive enough views.

Commune members of people's communes use the wages they earn from their labor to purchase consumer goods from the commune's supply and marketing cooperatives. There is also a commodity relationship between the collective and the individual, and this commodity relationship also has the socialist distribution relationship of paying according to work as its content. Rural people's communes in our country have already implemented the system of grain or food supply, and the distribution of goods in kind has already occupied a considerable important position in the income of farmers. However, the proportion of distribution of goods in kind cannot be expanded quickly now. With the continuous development of agricultural production, the commercialized part of commodities will continuously increase, and the monetary wage part of members will gradually increase. This situation shows that it is also of extreme importance to use the form of commodity relations to realize the distribution relationship of paying according to work among members of collective ownership.

VI. On the Principle of Equivalent Exchange

The commodity relationship under the socialist system in our country is a necessary form for realizing economic connection between the state-owned economy and the collective economy, between the collective economy and the collective economy, and between state-owned enterprises and state-owned enterprises. At the same time, it is also a necessary form for the state to realize distribution according to work among members of society. The contents contained in these forms are different, but they must all be carried out in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, that is, the law of value, that is to say, the exchange of each commodity must be carried out according to the amount of social necessary labor consumed to produce these products. Equivalent exchange is an objective inevitability of commodity relations.

(1) Between the state-owned economy under public ownership by the whole people and the people's communes under collective ownership, only by carrying out exchange in accordance with the principle of equivalence can the due interests of both parties to the exchange be guaranteed, so as to effectively encourage the production enthusiasm of the working people under collective ownership. If the state's purchase price of agricultural products from the people's communes is higher than their social necessary labor, it will expand the income of the communes and their members, increase the burden on the state, and thereby affect the state's socialist accumulation; conversely, if it is lower than their social necessary labor, it will reduce the income of the communes, making it impossible for the communes to exchange for products of the same value after selling their products. Under this situation, although the state can increase its income, it is difficult for the communes to expand their accumulation, and it is difficult to improve the production enthusiasm of the members. This is not conducive to the continuous development of the socialist economy, and is not conducive to further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

Not only between the state and the people's communes must the existence of the law of value be recognized and the principle of equivalent exchange be observed, but also between communes and within communes (between communes and production teams, between production teams, and between community-run enterprises) it is necessary to observe the principle of equivalent exchange, because they are all different owners of the means of production. If the principle of equivalent exchange is not observed, it will make one party take advantage and the other party suffer a loss; it will damage the mutual cooperation between them.

(2) Commodity relations between state-owned enterprises must also take equivalent exchange as a principle. Only in this way can they be compensated for the live labor and materialized labor consumed in production, can the implementation of the economic accounting system be guaranteed, and can the continuous development of socialist production be guaranteed. Some people believe that since the materials bought and sold through the market between state-owned enterprises are, in "content," the state's internal product allocation, then equivalent exchange loses its meaning, because content determines form, not form determines content. I think this view is worth considering. Marxism confirms that content plays a decisive role in form, but it does not deny that form can play an active role in content. Between state-owned enterprises, using the form of commodity value to serve the economic accounting of enterprises and to promote enterprises to continuously improve labor productivity and reduce costs, is this not playing an active role? If the exchange between state-owned enterprises does not observe the principle of equivalence, it will make some enterprises obtain excessively high profits, and make some enterprises not obtain profits, or even lose money, thereby affecting their economy and affecting the normal state of their production and operation. Some people believe that since the materials directly allocated by the state between state-owned enterprises only have the "shell" of commodities, then their allocation is beyond the scope of the law of value. I think this view is also worth considering. For the purpose of accounting, these allocated materials must be "evaluated," and evaluation is based on the law of value as a prerequisite. How can it be said that they are beyond the scope of the law of value! Of course, some allocated materials have prices lower than their value, but to maintain this situation for a long time, only the state can provide subsidies. The state's subsidies not only do not deny the principle of equivalent exchange, but also more clearly confirm the existence of this principle.

(3) There is also a need for equivalent exchange in commodity relations between the state and consumers, and between communes and consumers. Under the system of distribution according to work, people receive the cost of various consumer goods according to the amount and quality of labor they provide to society. If the state raises or lowers prices when selling consumer goods, it will affect the actual income of consumers. In order to guarantee the realization of the principle of distribution according to work, in order to guarantee that the working people can exchange for consumer goods equal to the labor they provide (that is, the part they work for themselves) with the monetary wages they earn, it is necessary for us to observe the principle of equivalent exchange. Some people believe that under certain circumstances, it is necessary for the state to use price policies to raise or lower the prices of certain consumer goods to affect the sales volume of consumer goods. Since this is the case, it is not necessary to observe the principle of equivalent exchange in the commodity relationship between the state and consumers. I think this view is one-sided. The commodity prices of socialist countries do have the phenomenon of deviating from value under certain circumstances, but this is not a general and universal phenomenon. The phenomenon of prices deviating from value is sometimes due to the rapid decline in the value of the commodities themselves following the increase in labor productivity; sometimes it is due to the active adjustment by the state for political and economic needs. The state's adjustment of prices can only be limited to certain kinds of commodities at certain times, and some are raised and some are lowered. Generally speaking, the prices and values of consumer goods are roughly equal. Therefore, I think it is worth considering to use the phenomenon of partial and temporary price deviation from value as a basis for negating equivalent exchange.

VII. Developing Commodity Production to Serve Socialism

The commodity relationship under the socialist system is fundamentally different from the commodity relationship under the capitalist system. The commodity relationship under the capitalist system is based on the capitalist ownership of the means of production. The capitalist commodity relationship serves the capitalist production relations. Therefore, the expanded commodity reproduction of capitalism is essentially the reproduction of capitalist production relations. Under the socialist system, the situation has undergone fundamental changes. The socialist commodity relationship is based on the socialist public ownership of the means of production. It completely negates the content of capitalist exploitation and serves the development of the socialist economy.

China's original economy was very backward, and commodity production was not developed. On the basis of socialist public ownership, developing commodity production is conducive to promoting the development of social productive forces in our country. Some people are afraid that developing commodity production in our country will lead to the development of capitalism. This is a view that lacks scientific basis. Stalin put it well, "Commodity production and capitalist production cannot be regarded as the same." "Capitalist production is the highest form of commodity production. Only when there is private ownership of the means of production, only when labor power appears on the market as a commodity, and capitalists can purchase it and exploit it in the production process, and therefore only when there is a system of capitalists exploiting wage workers in the country, will commodity production lead to capitalism." Judging from the current situation in our country, the bourgeoisie has not yet been eliminated politically and ideologically, but from the economic point of view, the bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated. After the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front in 1956, the capitalist economy no longer existed. Joint state-private enterprises under the fixed interest system are essentially socialist state-owned enterprises. Here, the leadership of the enterprise's production and operation is in the hands of the state and not in the hands of capitalists. Here, there is no condition for the commodification of labor power. In the process of circulation, the activities of capitalists have also been squeezed out. The decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front has made the broad masses of people deeply aware of the reactionary nature of the capitalist road and the inevitability of its elimination. The victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front and the political and ideological front has given our country reliable guarantees not only in the economic base,

    论社会主义制度下商品关系的必要性

    一、三大改造的胜利改变了
    我国商品关系的内容
    在1956年社会主义改造高潮以前，我国是多种成分的新民主主义经济，除了社会主义经济之外，还有资本主义经济和个体经济。这种多种经济成分的情况，明确地说明了我国商品关系的必然性和必要性。
    我们知道，资本主义生产是历史上商品生产的最高形式。资本家不但占有生产资料和消费品，并且以商品的形态购进劳动者的劳动力，又以商品的形态出卖劳动者在生产过程中为他所生产的生产物，实现他在生产过程中所剥削的剩余价值。这就是说，资本主义的生产方式是以商品关系作为前提的，离开了商品关系，资本家就没法解决其购进劳动力和生产资料的问题；也没法解决其贩卖生产品，实现其在生产过程中剥削自劳动者的剩余价值的问题。我国在实现全行业公私合营以前，私人资本主义经济，依然保持这个特点，因此，国家对它们的利用、限制和改造，是通过商品关系去进行的。在收购与定货的形式之下，工业资本家是从市场购进原料，从工人购进劳动力，而又把工人的劳动生产品，作为商品卖给国营经济的。在加工的形式之下，工业资本家虽然不从市场购进主要原料，但是，劳动力和次要原料仍然是以商品的形式购进的；他们虽然不是把加工的成品卖给国家，但是，他们从国家所得的“加工费”，仍然是以商品关系作为前提的。在实行“四马分肥”制度的公私合营企业中，资本家对于生产资料还有一部分所有权，私方的股息同企业利润的增长，有着直接的关系，因此，公私合营企业同国营经济，还不是完全属于同一个所有者。在这种情况之下，国营经济同公私合营企业间的经济联系，还是通过商品关系去进行，即通过加工订货的方式去进行的。
    个体手工业者和个体农民，基本上是占有生产资料的独立生产者，他们使用自己的劳动力和自己的生产资料去进行生产，因此，他们有权支配自己的生产品。但是，他们的生产并不能完全满足自己的消费。为了满足自己的需要，他们必须把自己的生产品去和别人的生产品相交换。这就是说，他们的生产品必须采取商品形式。恩格斯说：“在以自发的（没有任何计划的、逐渐产生的）社会分工作为基本生产形式的社会内，这种分工必然地使生产品采取商品的形式，商品的相互交换、买卖，使个别的生产者得有可能满足各式各样不同的需要”。我国在实现农业和手工业的合作化以前，个体农民和手工业者的生产，基本上都是以商品交换作为前提的；国家在经济方面对于它们的领导，也是通过商品关系的形式去进行的。国家把国营工业所生产的和从资本主义企业加工订货的农具、肥料和日用品等，去和农民的农产品相交换。这种情况，证明国家和农民间，存在着一种商品关系；同时，也说明国家是利用这种商品关系去实现对于广大农民在经济方面的领导。
    在1956年国家对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造取得决定性的胜利以后，多成分的新民主主义经济基本上就完成了到社会主义经济的过渡，以全民所有制和集体所有制为基础的社会主义经济，就在国民经济中占着统治的地位。但是，商品关系的经济基础，还是存在着。这可从国营经济同集体经济间的经济联系、集体经济间的经济联系、国营企业间的经济联系和国家同消费者间的关系去考察。
    二、国营经济同集体经济间的商品关系
    在我国的条件下，工业生产主要由全民所有制的国营企业经营，而农业生产主要由集体所有制的人民公社经营。在工业同农业之间，在城市同农村之间，存在着一种互相依存，互相支援的社会主义分工协作的关系。为了供应城市居民和工业的需要，国家必须从人民公社取得粮食和其他经济作物；为了满足农村人民生活和农业生产的需要，人民公社必须从国营企业取得工业日用品、农具和农业肥料等等。只有这样，社会主义工业和社会主义农业才能顺畅地、不断地进行扩大的再生产。现在的问题是：我们在社会主义工业同社会主义农业间，通过什么方式，去实现这种互助协作的经济联系呢？
    在我国的现阶段，国家对于人民公社的产品，是不能采取直接调拨的方式，去处理社会主义工业同社会主义农业之间的经济联系的。人民公社的生产资料，还是集体所有制。集体所有制也是社会主义的一种公有制，但是，它的生产资料和产品，只属于某一个集体的成员所有，而不属于全体人民所有。国家如果对人民公社的产品，现在就采取直接调拨的办法，在实质上，就是否定了人民公社的生产资料集体所有制，把它们同全民所有制的国营企业一样看待。按照我国今天的生产力水平和农民群众的政治觉悟程度来看，显然，是不适当的。
    在我国的现阶段，国家对于人民公社既不能采取直接调拨的办法去处理工业和农业、城市和农村间经济联系的问题，那就只能采取商品交换的形式，去处理这个问题了。在这种方式之下，在等价的原则之下，国营经济同集体经济，各以自己的产品，换取对方的产品，双方都能够从交换中，得到应得的利益。这种办法在现阶段是最能得到广大农民拥护的。当然，社会主义制度下两种生产资料所有制间的商品关系同私有制的商品关系，在性质上是有区别的。在私有制度下，生产资料和消费品都是互不相依的私人劳动的产物；而在社会主义制度下，生产资料和消费品已经不是互不相依的私人劳动的产物，它们如果不是属于全民所有的国营企业的产物，便是属于集体所有的人民公社的产物。但是，从产品所有权的转移来说，社会主义两种所有制间的商品关系，在一定程度以内，同私有制度下的商品关系，却有相似之处。由于全民所有的国营企业同集体所有的人民公社，在社会主义的范围内，是不同的生产资料和产品的所有者，这就使商品生产和商品交换，成为它们间实现经济联系的唯一形式。斯大林曾经说道：“这种情况（指全民所有制同集体所有制同时并存——引者）就使得国家所能支配的只是国家企业的产品，至于集体农庄的产品，只有集体农庄才能作为自己的财产来支配。然而，集体农庄只愿以商品形式把自己的产品转让出来，愿意以这种商品换得它们所需要的商品。现时，除了经过商品的联系，除了通过买卖的交换以外，与城市的其他经济联系，都是集体农庄所不能接受的。因此，商品生产和商品流通，目前在我国（指苏联——引者），也像大约三十年以前当列宁宣布必须以全力扩展商品流通时一样，仍是必要的东西。”把斯大林的这段话，用来说明我国现阶段社会主义的两种生产资料公有制间商品关系的必要性，我认为是适合的。
    事实证明：在我国目前的条件下，只有通过商品交换的方式，才能在经济上顺利地把全民所有制的国营经济同集体所有制的人民公社联系起来，才能顺利地把城市和农村，把社会主义工业同社会主义农业密切地联系起来，并在这里实现了国营经济对于人民公社在经济方面的领导。这样做，有利于高速度发展我国国民经济和社会主义建设；有利于发展农村公社的经济和鼓励集体所有制经济中劳动人民的生产积极性；有利于进一步改善、提高广大劳动人民的物质生活，从而，有利于进一步巩固我国的工农联盟。因此，我们可以说，在我国的现阶段，在全民所有制同集体所有制间，发展商品生产和商品交换，在实质上，是工人阶级团结五亿农民群众的问题，是工人阶级进一步巩固工农联盟的问题。
    有些同志曾经认为我国农村人民公社包含有全民所有制的成分，并且将来要从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，因而，在国营经济同人民公社间的经济联系的问题上，忽视了商品交换的必要性。这种认识是不合于客观事实的。现在的人民公社虽然有全民所有制的成分，但是，公社的生产资料所有制基本上还是集体的，它们要从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，还需要一个过程。因此，这种轻视商品关系的认识，是不利于正确地处理城市和农村间、社会主义工业同社会主义农业间的经济联系，是不利于进一步巩固我国的工农联盟的。
        三、集体经济间的商品关系
    从集体所有制的角度来看，商品关系不仅存在于人民公社同国营经济之间，而且存在于公社同公社之间，存在于公社内部，即公社与生产队、生产队与生产队之间，这就是说，存在于各个集体所有者之间。
    生产资料集体所有制的公有化的范围，只限于某一个集体，这个集体以外的单位或个人，都不能占有它的生产资料和产品。这就是说，集体和集体之间，它们都是不同的生产资料和产品的所有者，它们要相互发生经济联系，也只有通过商品交换的形式去进行。
    现在人民公社的生产资料，还不是完全的公社所有制，除了公社直接所有的部分以外，还有生产队和生产小队的所有制，在这里，生产队（有些地方是生产大队，总之，大体相当于原来的高级农业生产合作社）的所有制是公社中的基本所有制。因为现在的公社所有制还是部分的，基本上是生产队的所有制，生产小队也有部分所有制。因为公社内部实行着三级管理、三级核算的制度，因此，公社内部（即公社和生产队之间）的物质和产品的调动，除了依据规定应该上缴的部分，如国家农业税、公社的公积金和公益金等以外，就不可能采取直接调拨的方式，而必须通过商品关系，通过商品交换的方式去进行。
    现在各生产队的经济情况是不相同的。有的生产队比较富裕；有的生产队比较贫困。在富队和穷队之间，一方面当然应该提倡共产主义的协作互助精神，但是，更主要的还要贯彻社会主义按劳分配的原则，也就是说，生产队与生产队之间要通过商品关系实行等价交换。这么一来，劳动得较多、较好的生产队及其成员，就能获得较多、较高的劳动报酬，从而，他们的生产积极性，也就能够更好地调动起来了。
    公社的社员，除了在生产队参加劳动，按劳分配以外，在自己的自留地上还进行一些家庭农副业的生产，如菜蔬、家禽、蛋品以及小手工业产品等等。这些东西，都是属于他们个人所有的。对于这些属于个人生产的农副产品，如果要转移所有权，也只能通过商品交换的方式去进行。这样才能促进广大群众对于副业生产的积极性。
    人民公社现在的这种基本队有制和部分社有制的情况，基本上是以当前我国农业的生产水平作为前提的。我国现在的农业生产，还是以人力操作、畜力耕耘和使用自然肥料为主，因此，产品很不丰富；公社本身的经济力量还不强大；各个生产队的经济发展水平也就不能平衡。跟着农业生产水平的提高，跟着公社本身经济力量的强大，跟着各个生产队的发展水平逐步趋于平衡，跟着农民群众的社会主义觉悟的更加提高，现在这种不完全的公社所有制就会逐步地改变为基本上公社所有制，实现以公社为基本核算单位，实现全社统一计算盈亏和统一分配的制度。但是，要完成这个过程，需要一定的时间。就是到了那个时候，生产队可能还是公社内的一级核算单位，还保持着队的部分所有制，这样，公社内部的商品关系，可能因为实现全社的统一计算盈亏和统一分配而被缩小；但不会因此而完全被废除。
    在农村人民公社建立的初期，有些同志认为我国的商品生产和商品交换，将很快就被缩小以至被“废除”。他们所提的理由是：人民公社是多种经营的综合经济，它不但经营农业、林业、牧业、副业和渔业，而且经营工业；它不但能够生产社员所需要的生活资料，而且能够生产公社本身所需要的生产资料。公社既然是一个自给自足的经济单位，它所需要的物品，很快就能达到自产自用，那又何必还要对外搞商品交换。在公社内部，供给制的实行和逐步扩大，使几亿农民直接从公社领到消费品。这就使公社内部的商品关系，迅速地被缩小、被废除了。这种看法是不符合于客观事实的。
    第一，农村人民公社的确是多种经营的综合经济，它比农业生产合作社能够产生更多的物品，来满足公社在生产上和社员在消费上的需要，但是，我们并不能因此就得出这样的结论，认为人民公社是一个“独立”、“自足”的“小王国”。因为：（一）公社的多种经营不但不会排斥商品交换，而且更需要商品交换。公社的工业只是为农业服务和为农产品加工的一些小型工业，它们不可能制造所有的生产资料。为了发展各种生产，为了实现农业的机械化、电气化，公社需要从国家取得更多的生产资料（如拖拉机、康拜因、卡车、肥料和各种农具等）和生活资料（如布匹、收音机和其他日用工业品等）。（二）各地人民公社的自然条件和历史条件是不尽相同的，它们或多或少有一些土特产。这些特产，公社本身可能需要得不多，或者不需要。为了国家和其他公社的需要，公社是不可能不进行这些特产的生产的。要生产这些本身不需要或需要得很少的东西，就必然发生对外交换的问题。（三）跟着生产的发展，自产自给的产品必然会超过公社本身的需要，这就要求它同国家和其他公社进行交换。而同时，跟着社员生活水平的逐步提高，他们的需要也就越来越加复杂。日益复杂的需要，断不是公社本身的生产所能满足的。这就要求公社不断地从国家和其他公社，购进自己所不能生产或者产量不够的物品。事实证明：那种认为人民公社是自给自足的“独立王国”的想法和做法，都是不符合于客观的事实的。
    第二，人民公社内的产品，除了自己消费的物品（如自留地出产的副食品）外，一部分采取供给制的分配形式（如粮食），一部分采取工资制的分配形式。现在公社的分配制度中，工资还是主要的部分。社员领了工资，要拿去购买商品；有些供给物品如果采用代金的方式，同样也要拿代金去购买商品。
    因此在实现基本上公社所有制以前，公社内部的商品关系是必然会存在的，就是实现基本上公社所有制以后，由于队的部分所有制的存在，公社内部的商品关系，也不会彻底被“废除”。到了将来，当农村人民公社都过渡到全民所有制的时候，社会主义工业同社会主义农业就不复是不同的生产资料和产品的所有者，那其间，它们间的经济联系，是否还要通过商品交换的方式去进行呢？对于这个问题，可以从现在国营企业间的经济联系所采取的方式，去进行考察。
        四、国营企业间的商品关系
    在现阶段，国营企业间的经济联系是在社会主义两种所有制同时并存的条件下进行的。因此，有些人认为：如果消费品和生产资料在国营经济和集体经济间的转移，需要通过商品交换的方式，那末，社会主义国营企业生产的物品，就必然具有商品的形式，因为在社会主义的扩大再生产过程中，不可能有几种不同的经济范畴同时在发生作用。这种看法，是有一定根据的。但是，它只从外在的因素去说明国营企业间的商品关系，而未能从全民所有制的内部去说明这个问题。
    如上所述，在国营企业同人民公社之间，在公社同公社之间，在生产队同生产队之间，因为它们是不同的生产资料和产品的所有者，所以彼此间的物资调动，不能由国家或公社直接调拨；而在国营企业间，这个问题并不存在。国营企业都是全民所有制的企业，它们间的关系，并不是不同的生产资料和产品的所有者之间的关系，因此，代表全体人民的国家有权力对它们的产品，按计划进行直接分配。现在我国国营重工业所制造的一些重要生产资料，如重型机器、机车、轮船、卡车、飞机、钢铁和钢材等等，都不是经过市场买卖，而是由国家按计划直接分配的。生产这些重要物资的企业，在产品制成之后，按国家计划，交给使用单位。生产单位和使用单位之间的这种关系，显然是产品的调拨关系，是全民所有制内部的产品分配关系，因为这些物资的调动，既不发生所有权转移的问题，也没有经过市场买卖的方式。
    但是，这些由国家按计划在国营企业间直接调拨的重要生产资料，是要估价的。“估价”使这些被调拨的物资，不能不具有商品的形式。这些被调拨的物资，为什么要“估价”呢？这是因为国营企业实行经济核算的原故。经济核算意味着国营企业在完成国家计划，合理使用资源，不断地提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本等方面，对国家负有物质上的责任；也意味着它对其他国营企业负有履行自己义务的物质责任。这种情况使国营企业在经济上、业务上具有相对的独立性。当然，国营企业的这种独立性，在性质上，同集体所有制经济单位或企业的独立性，是不相同的。生产资料的集体所有，使合作社、人民公社或生产队具有同国营企业或其他集体企业，彼此互相对待的独立性，而国营企业在经济上业务上的独立性则是在生产资料全民所有制的范围内实现的，交给某一个企业使用的生产资料仍属社会主义国家所有，因此，国家就有权力去直接调拨它们的产品。但是，由于实行经济核算而来的经济上业务上的独立性，使国营企业要负责盈亏，负责搞好生产经营。为了计算盈亏，为了检查督促企业的生产经营，那些由国家直接调拨的物资，就不能不利用价值形式，进行“估价”了。这些由国家在国营企业间直接调拨的物资，在形式和内容上存在着对立统一的关系。经济核算使我们有必要利用旧形式（商品价值），去为新内容（产品调拨）服务，使商品价值的形式同产品调拨的内容，结合起来。
    各个国营企业所生产的产品，由国家统一计划生产和统一调拨的，只是其中的一部分；其余部分，因为品种复杂，在现阶段，国家对它们不需要，也不可能进行直接的、统一的分配，从而，各个国营企业间对于这些物资的调动，就只能通过市场买卖的形式去进行了。事实证明：国家对于这些在现阶段还不需要、还不可能直接在各个国营企业间进行调拨的产品，利用商品、货币、价值形式，去进行分配，是一种良好的方式。这种方式灵活地适应着这些品种复杂的物资的特点和使用单位的需要，使我们能够用较少的时间和劳力去处理它们的分配问题。由于通过市场买卖，这些产品较诸由国家直接调拨的产品，就具有更明确的商品形式；由于通过市场买卖，参加买卖的国营企业彼此间，就更明显地存在着一种商品交换关系了。但是，国营企业间这种商品关系，同国营企业和人民公社间，同公社和公社间的商品关系，在性质上，是不相同的。国营企业间的这种商品关系，并不是不同的生产资料和产品的所有者之间的交换关系、而是国家利用商品、货币、价值形式，去实现产品分配的一种方式。
    有些同志把国营企业间商品交换的形式，同产品分配的内容，完全对立起来。有的人认为国营企业间的商品交换，既然不发生所有权转移的问题，既然具有产品分配的内容，那就不存在着商品形式的问题，因此，他们就忽视了在全民所有制内部利用商品、货币、价值形式的必要性。有的人则根据国营企业间这些物资通过市场买卖的事实，就忽略了它们间的交换，在性质上，已经具有全民所有制内部产品分配的新内容。这些看法，我认为是不够全面的。
    既然那些由国家直接调拨的国营企业产品，依然有必要利用商品、价值形式，去进行经济核算；那末，那些通过市场买卖的国营企业产品，就更有必要利用商品、价值形式，去进行经济核算了。实行经济核算的国营企业，在经济上业务上的相对独立性，在产品通过市场买卖的场合，较诸产品直接由国家调拨的场合，是来得更为显著的。由此可见，国营企业的实行经济核算和它们在经济上业务上的独立性，使国家有必要利用商品价值形式，去实现它们间产品的分配。
        五、国家同消费者的商品关系
    国家把国营企业所生产的消费品和从人民公社收购得来的消费品，经过市场关系，卖给企业、机关和学校的工人群众和工作人员等消费者，在这里，国家同千千万万的消费者之间，也存在着一种商品关系。这种商品关系的特点是没有商品对商品的交换，只有货币对商品的交换。消费者用货币去换取国家所提供的商品，消费者是购者；而国家的国营商店则是卖者。
    在国家同消费者的商品关系中，消费者的货币，一般说来，是他们劳动所得的工资。能不能说他们购买国营商店的商品，在实质上是劳动同商品的交换呢？我认为这种提法是值得考虑的。职工在社会主义国营企业中的劳动，是以生产资料的全民所有制作为前提的。在全民所有制的条件之下，工人群众同全国人民共同占有生产资料，他们是劳动者，又是生产资料的主人。因而，并不存在着工人群众雇佣自己，把自己的劳动力卖给自己的事实。在这种情况下，我们怎能说他们把自己的劳动同国家的消费品相交换呢？
    能不能把国家同消费者间的商品关系，理解为生产资料的全民所有制同消费品的个人所有制间的交换关系呢？从消费品的所有权来说，经过买卖，商品的确就从国家所有变为个人的所有。消费者在获得了商品之后，就有权力去支配它。但是，如果把生产资料的全民所有制同消费品的个人所有制对立起来，那是值得考虑的。在社会主义国营经济条件下，消费品的个人所有是以生产资料的全民所有制作为前提的，它包含在以生产资料的全民所有制为前提的社会主义生产关系之中，这就是全民所有制条件下的分配关系。如果把生产资料全民所有同消费品的个人所有完全对立起来，在实质上，就否定了个人在生产资料和产品的全民所有中的一份，就把生产资料的全民所有制同以全民所有制为前提的分配关系对立起来。这是不大妥当的。
    国家同消费者间的这种商品关系，实质上，是国家在企业、机关和学校的工人群众和工作人员间，分配消费品的一种方式。在社会主义时期，由于社会生产力的水平还不够高，社会的生产品还未达到极大丰富的程度，由于劳动还没有像共产主义社会那样成为每个社会成员生活的第一需要，由于脑力劳动和体力劳动之间、熟练劳动和简单劳动之间还存在着区别，因此，在社会成员之间，消费品的分配，还不可能实现按需分配的原则，而只能实行按劳分配的原则。在这种情况之下，除了不断地提高劳动人民的社会主义觉悟之外，实行按劳分配的原则，使工作者在一定程度上从物质上关心自己的劳动成果，这对于发展社会主义生产是一个极其重要的条件。在当前，当商品关系成为社会主义两种所有制间经济联系的唯一形式的条件下，当国营企业间的经济联系还有必要利用商品货币形式的条件下，在全民所有制的内部，劳动耗费也就不可能直接采用劳动时间去计算，而必须利用商品货币的形式。经验证明，在社会主义阶段，商品货币的形式是实行按劳分配原则的比较良好形式。利用商品货币形式去实现消费品的分配，能够灵活地适应各人的不同需要和不同爱好。经验证明，在现在的条件下，对于社会成员绝大多数的消费品，如果不通过商品货币形式，而采取直接分配实物的办法，那是不可思议的事情。
    在按劳分配的制度下，国家和消费者间的商品关系，在实质上，包含着一个社会主义分配关系的内容，在这里，商品关系的形式同分配关系的内容，也存在着对立统一的关系。有的同志，只抓住国家在社会成员间分配消费品的本质，就忽视了利用商品货币形式，去实现这种分配关系的必要；有的同志，由于过分强调了商品货币的形式，就忽视了社会主义分配关系的内容。这都是不够全面的看法。
    人民公社的社员，用其劳动所得的工资，向公社的供销部购买消费品，也存在着集体同个人间的商品关系，而这种商品关系也是以按劳付酬的社会主义分配关系作为内容的。我国农村人民公社已经实行粮食或伙食供给制度，实物分配已经在农民收入中占有相当重要的地位。但是，实物分配的比重，现在是不可能扩大得很快的。跟着农业生产的不断发展，商品中商品化的部分将不断地在增加，社员的货币工资部分将逐步地在增长。这种情况说明：利用商品关系的形式，在集体所有制的成员间，实现按劳付酬的分配关系，也是具有极其重要的意义的。
      六、关于等价交换的原则
    我国社会主义制度下的商品关系，是国营经济同集体经济间、集体经济同集体经济间、国营企业同国营企业间实现经济联系的必要形式，同时，也是国家在社会成员间实现按劳分配的必要形式。这些形式所包含的内容，是不相同的，但是，它们都必须遵守等价交换的原则即价值规律去进行，即是说，每种商品的交换，都必须按照产生这些产品所耗费的社会必要劳动量去进行。等价交换是商品关系的客观必然性。
    （一）在全民所有制的国营经济同集体所有制的人民公社之间，只有遵守等价的原则去进行交换，才能保证交换双方应得的利益，从而，才能有效地鼓励集体所有制的劳动人民的生产积极性。国家对于人民公社的农产品的采购价格，如果高于它们的社会必要劳动量，就会扩大公社和它的社员的收入，就会增加国家的负担，从而，就会影响到国家的社会主义积累；反之，如果低于它们的社会必要劳动量，就会减少公社的收入，使公社在出售其产品以后，不能够换回同量价值的产品。在这种情况之下，国家虽然可以增加收入，但是，公社的积累就难于扩大，社员的生产积极性，也就难于提高了。这对于不断地发展社会主义经济，对于进一步巩固工农联盟，都是不利的。
    不但在国家同人民公社之间，必须承认价值规律的存在，遵守等价交换的原则，就是在公社间和在公社内部（在公社同生产队间、在生产队间和在社营企业间）也有必要遵守等价原则去进行交换，因为它们都是不同的生产资料所有者。如果不遵守等价交换的原则，就会使一方占了便宜，一方吃了亏；就会使彼此间的互相协作，受到损害。
    （二）国营企业间的商品关系，也必须以等价交换作为原则，只有这样，才能使他们在生产中所消耗的活劳动和物化劳动，得到应有的补偿，才能保证经济核算制的贯彻执行，从而，才能保证社会主义生产的不断发展。有人认为那些在国营企业间通过市场买卖的物资，既然在“内容”上是国家内部的产品调拨，那末，等价交换，就失去了意义，因为内容决定了形式，而不是形式决定了内容。我认为这种看法是值得考虑的。马克思主义确认内容对形式起着决定作用，但并不否认形式对内容能够起着积极作用。在国营企业间，利用商品价值形式，去为企业的经济核算服务，去推动企业不断地提高劳动生产率和降低成本，这难道不是起着积极作用吗？国营企业间的交换，如果不遵守等价原则，就会使某些企业获得过高盈利，使某些企业得不到盈利，甚或亏本，从而，就会使它们的经济受到影响，使它们的生产经营的正常状态受到影响。有人认为那些在国营企业间由国家直接调拨的物资，既然只有商品的“外壳”，那末，它们的调拨，就超出价值规律发生作用的范围以外。我认为这种看法，也是值得考虑的。为了核算，这些调拨的物资不能不“估价”，而估价则是以价值规律作为前提的。这怎能说它们超出价值规律发生作用范围之外呢！当然，有一些被调拨的物资，价格是低于价值的，但是，要长期维持这种状况，只有由国家给予补贴。国家的这种补贴，不但不否定等价交换的原则，反而更明确地证实了这一原则的存在。
    （三）国家、公社同消费者间的商品关系，也存在着等价交换的必要性。在按劳分配的制度下，人们按其对社会所提供的劳动的数量和质量，领取各类消费品的代价。如果国家在销售消费品的时候，提高或降低价格，那就会影响消费者的实际收入。为了保证按劳分配原则的实现，为了保证劳动人民用他们所得的货币工资，能够换回同他们所提供的劳动（即为自己劳动的那一部分）相等的消费品，我们就有必要遵守等价交换的原则。有人认为国家在某种情况之下，有必要利用价格政策，提高或降低某些消费品的价格，去影响消费品的销售量，既然是这样，那末，在国家和消费者之间的商品关系，就不一定要遵守等价交换的原则了。我认为这种看法是有片面性的。社会主义国家的商品价格，在一定的场合之下，确有同价值背离的现象，但是，这不是一般的、普遍的现象。价格同价值背离的现象，有的时候是由于劳动生产力的提高，商品本身价值急速地跟着下降；有的时候是由于国家为了政治经济上的需要而主动调整。国家对于价格的调整，只能限于某些时候的某几种商品，而且有的提高，有的降低，总的说来，消费品的价格和价值大体上是相等的。因此，把局部的、一时的价格背离价值的现象，去作为否定等价交换的根据，我认为是值得考虑的。
      七、发展商品生产为社会主义服务
    社会主义制度下的商品关系，同资本主义制度下的商品关系，在本质上，有着深刻的区别。资本主义制度下的商品关系是以生产资料的资本家所有制作为基础的，资本主义的商品关系是为资本主义的生产关系服务的，因此，资本主义的扩大商品再生产，在实质上就是资本主义生产关系的再生产。在社会主义制度下，情况就起着根本的变化。社会主义的商品关系以生产资料的社会主义公有制作为基础，它完全否定了资本主义剥削的内容，而为社会主义经济的发展服务。
    中国原来的经济很落后，商品生产并不发达。在社会主义公有制的基础上，发展商品生产，有利于促进我国社会生产力的发展。有人害怕在我国发展商品生产会引导到发展资本主义。这是一种缺乏科学根据的看法。斯大林说得好，“不能把商品生产和资本主义生产看成一样。”“资本主义生产是商品生产的最高形式。只有存在着生产资料的私有制，只有劳动力作为商品出现在市场上，资本家能够购买它并在生产过程中剥削它，因而只有在国内存在着资本家剥削雇佣工人的制度时，商品生产才会引导到资本主义。”从我国现在的情况来看，在政治上思想上资产阶级尚未被消灭，但是，从经济方面来看，资产阶级基本上是被消灭了的。在1956年经济战线上社会主义革命胜利以后，资本主义经济就不存在了。定息制度下的公私合营企业，在实质上已经是社会主义的国营企业，在这里，企业的生产经营的领导权，掌握在国家手里而不掌握在资本家手里；在这里，并不存在着劳动力商品化的条件。在流通过程中，资本家的活动，也已经被排挤出去了。政治思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，使广大人民深刻地认识到资本主义道路的反动性和它的消灭的必然性。经济战线和政治思想战线上社会主义革命的胜利，使我国不但在经济基础方面，而且在人民的思想认识方面，获得了可靠的保证，使商品生产和商品交换，不复恢复和引导到资本主义，而为发展社会主义经济和促进社会生产力服务。
    明确在社会主义制度下商品关系的必要性和遵守等价交换的原则，同强调政治挂帅，决不是互相对立，互相矛盾，而是密切地辩证地统一在一起的。不可以认为既然要政治挂帅，就可以不考虑价值规律的存在，就可以不贯彻等价交换的原则；更不可以认为既然承认价值规律的客观存在，既然要贯彻等价交换的原则，那就用不着政治挂帅。事实证明：在商品关系中贯彻等价交换的原则，有利于正确地处理人民内部矛盾，有利于正确地处理国家利益、集体利益和个人利益之间的矛盾。这就是说，政治挂帅需要善于考虑客观经济规律，需要善于掌握客观规律的必然性。但是，这并不是说认识和遵守客观经济规律，就是政治挂帅的主要内容，这也不是说，政治挂帅只着重局部的、个人的目前利益，而不去掌握全体的和长远的利益。事实证明：如果离开政治挂帅，则等价交换的客观规律就不一定能够对社会主义建设发生积极作用。只有贯彻政治挂帅，才能使我国的工业和农业之间的商品生产和等价交换，不致受到资本主义的经营作风所影响，而能积极地为发展社会主义生产和建成社会主义社会的伟大历史任务服务；只有贯彻政治挂帅，才能使国营企业和人民公社之间，使国营企业彼此之间，使各个集体经济单位彼此之间，在处理经济联系问题的时候，不致只顾本单位的利益，而能在“全国一盘棋”的前提之下，在社会主义大协作之中，积极地发挥其互相支援的作用；只有贯彻执行党的领导，贯彻进行社会主义和共产主义的思想政治教育，才能使全国每一个社会主义企业、每一个工作人员和每一个劳动生产者，不致于把眼光只局限在本单位和个人的目前利益之内，而能够认识到个人利益和目前利益依存于整体利益和长远利益，认识到个人幸福依存于全体人民的社会主义崇高理想的实现，因而在劳动中生龙活虎地表现共产主义的自我牺牲的英雄气概。有些人是离开政治挂帅而孤立地去强调商品关系中的等价交换的。这是一种错误的看法和做法。孤立地强调等价交换的结果，不外是用“钞票挂帅”去代替政治挂帅。在实质上，这是资产阶级的思想意识和经营作风在处理经济联系问题上的表现。我们必须批判这种把等价交换同政治挂帅分割开来而孤立地强调商品等价交换的错误看法和做法。
