Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 17th: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's steel and steel product output has reached a new peak since October. In the first half of October, the company's steel output increased by 31.37% compared to the same period in September, the average daily steel production level increased by 21.61% compared to September, and steel product output increased by 25.53% compared to the same period in September.

Since October, from the Party Committee Secretary and Manager to leaders at all levels, the company has gone deep into the front lines of production, focusing on progress and weak links, ensuring that every shift and every link is tightly controlled, promoting even greater improvements in production.

Among the three production shifts in each factory, the night shift's output was often lower than the other two shifts, which was a significant weak link in production. Since October, many units have taken various measures to strengthen the night shift, resulting in many night shifts exceeding the output of the morning and afternoon shifts. The Zhongshan Hall Converter Plant assigned a group of leading cadres to work alongside the night shift and assist the duty director in commanding production, equipping them with stronger equipment maintenance and material supply personnel. The company's transportation department, supply department, and other logistics units also strengthened their work on the night shift, ensuring that whatever was needed was available. As a result of these efforts, from October 1st to 14th, the night shift's steel output at this plant was 12.05% higher than the afternoon shift and 7.51% higher than the morning shift. On the 15th, the night shift also produced twenty-one heats of steel, setting a new record since October. With the significant increase in the night shift's output, the other two shifts also continued to leap forward, and the plant's steel output in the first half of October increased by a staggering 59.89% compared to the same period in September.

Since October, the company's leaders at all levels have also focused on key technical measures, organizing specialized teams to promote the technical operating experience of neutral iron furnaces, large air volumes, and large slag volumes, further reducing the sulfur content of pig iron, creating favorable conditions for the open hearth and converter to shorten smelting times. Workers in each steelmaking workshop launched competitive performance competitions, vigorously promoting advanced experience targeting key production areas, which also played a significant role in increasing steel output.

　　重钢生产登上新高峰
    上半月钢产量比9月同期提高31％，钢材增长25％
    据新华社重庆17日电　重庆钢铁公司钢和钢材的产量，10月份以来又达到新高峰。10月上半月，全公司钢产量比9月同期提高31.37％，钢的平均日产水平比9月提高21.61％，钢材产量比9月同期增长25.53％。
    10月份以来，这个公司从党委书记和经理到各级领导干部，都分别深入生产第一线，大抓进度，大抓薄弱环节，做到班班抓紧、环环抓紧，促进了生产的更大提高。
    各厂的三个生产班中，过去夜班的产量往往低于其他两个班，这是生产上一个重要的薄弱环节。10月份以来，许多单位都采取了各种措施来加强夜班，使很多夜班的生产超过了早班和中班。中山堂转炉厂分出一班领导干部专门在夜班跟班劳动，并协助值班主任指挥生产，配备较强的设备维修、材料供应等职能干部，公司的运输部、供应处等后勤单位也加强了对夜班的工作，保证要什么有什么。经过这些努力，10月1日到14日，这个厂的夜班的钢产量比中班还高12.05％，比早班高7.51％；15日的夜班还吹炼了二十一炉钢，创造了10月份以来的最新纪录。由于夜班的产量显著提高，其他两个班也继续跃进，这个厂10月份上半月的钢产量比9月同期猛增59.89％。
    公司的各级领导10月份以来还大抓关键性的技术措施，组织专门力量推广中性化铁炉、大风量、大渣量的技术操作经验，进一步降低生铁含硫量，为平炉、转炉缩短冶炼时间创造了有利条件。各炼钢车间职工开展对手表演赛，针对生产关键大力推广先进经验，对提高钢产量也起到很大作用。
