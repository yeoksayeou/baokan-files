Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Vice Premier Bo Yibo of the State Council spoke today at the National Coal Industry Large-Area High-Yield Red Flag Competition Broadcasting Conference. Vice Premier Bo Yibo said: At the beginning of March this year, we held such a conference here. After that meeting, a vigorous upsurge of socialist labor competition was quickly launched on the national coal industry front, which enabled the coal industry to achieve great achievements on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In August and September, after opposing right-leaning ideas and encouraging vigor, you once again set off a new high tide of production and made even more outstanding achievements in all aspects such as production, capital construction, geology, and machinery manufacturing. I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to you.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo then analyzed the current national political and economic situation. He said that the current political and economic situation in our country is very good, truly prosperous and thriving. Although agricultural production has suffered from a drought that has not been encountered in recent years, the total output of grain, cotton, and other crops has still greatly increased on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year; industrial production and transportation volume are constantly rising; the market is prosperous and active. This fully demonstrates the great power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and they are continuing to exert their greater power. In terms of the industrial front alone, industrial production has achieved new growth in the first seven months of this year on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the call to "oppose right-leaning ideas, encourage vigor, and vigorously increase production and practice economy," the broad masses of workers enthusiastically responded to this great call of the Party and immediately launched a new upsurge of the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, which promoted a sharp rise in production in the recent two months. The total industrial output value in August increased by 14% compared with July; the total industrial output value in September increased by 27% compared with August. This has enabled us to complete the production tasks for the first three quarters of this year ahead of schedule and overfulfill them, and production has greatly increased compared with the same period last year. The total industrial output value has increased by 45.5% compared with the same period last year, and the output of 24 of the 54 major products has already exceeded the total annual output of the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

On the coal industry front, the production tasks have also been completed very well. In the first nine and a half months of this year, 274.5 million tons of raw coal have been produced, exceeding the total annual output of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 by 1.7%. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party encouraged you, and since August, the national coal output has rapidly increased. Calculated by average daily output, it was 784,000 tons in July, 877,000 tons in August, 1,129,000 tons in September, and the average daily output in the first ten days of October was 1,140,000 tons. And it broke the "routine" of being tight at the end and loose at the beginning, with the production level in the first ten days being lower than the production level in the last ten days of the previous month, and production can continue to grow at a high speed. The capital construction of the coal industry has also achieved great achievements. From January to September, the designed production capacity of the mines that have been started and continued construction reached 215,760,000 tons, an increase of 78.7% compared with the same period last year; the production capacity of the mines put into production reached 18,690,000 tons, an increase of 25% compared with the same period last year; the raw coal processing capacity of the coal washing plants put into production reached 24,500,000 tons, an increase of 6.6 times compared with the same period last year. These figures fully show that the production and construction of the coal industry this year are continuing to make a Great Leap Forward.

The national situation is very good, and the situation in the coal industry is also very good. We must seize this great opportunity, continue to oppose right-leaning ideas, work hard, actively promote the advanced experience of various effective technical innovations and technical revolutions, and push the ongoing large-area high-yield red flag competition movement to a new stage. Strive to fully complete this year's production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, and at the same time, prepare for next year's production, especially for the first quarter of next year, in order to lay the foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward next year.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that the coal industry is an important sector in the national economy, and it has a close relationship with the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives. Since entering the fourth quarter, all economic sectors have been developing at a higher speed, requiring more coal; at the same time, entering the winter, the people's heating coal also needs to be greatly increased. Therefore, increasing the production of more coal to meet the growing needs of the national economy is a glorious political and economic task for the national coal miners. We believe that the national coal miners will definitely be able to achieve this glorious task with even more vigorous revolutionary spirit.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that the large-area high-yield red flag competition movement that has been launched in the national coal mines in the past six months is an important method to develop the coal industry in a faster, better, and more economical way. First of all, it has mobilized the national coal miners from various different positions, and universally formed a socialist competition upsurge of you chasing me, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, so that the backward have caught up with the advanced, thus greatly expanding the lineup of advanced units. Secondly, due to the adoption of the method of large-area high-yield, in the entire production process, the relationship between various production links such as tunneling, mining, lifting, transportation, and electromechanical maintenance, and between various departments, has become closer, and leading cadres at all levels often go deep into the front line of production, constantly paying attention to the mutual cooperation and comprehensive improvement of various industries; and the broad masses are also concerned about the comprehensive improvement of various types of work, not only concerned about their own units, but also concerned about other units, and the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration has been greatly promoted. Furthermore, the large-area high-yield movement can make the movement of increasing production and practicing economy more concrete, vivid, and lively. In particular, organizing competitions in rounds every year and organizing evaluations in stages enables the mass movement to continue to develop rhythmically and wave after wave.

The development of the large-area high-yield red flag competition movement has also greatly promoted the technical innovation and technical revolution of various coal mining enterprises. The broad masses of workers have boldly carried out innovation and creation aimed at the weak links in production.

Regarding how to better complete the coal production plan for the fourth quarter, Vice Premier Bo Yibo put forward four tasks:

First, further implement the Party's instructions on "opposing right-leaning ideas, encouraging vigor, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy," thoroughly oppose right-leaning ideas, fully encourage vigor, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy more deeply, more widely, and more persistently. This year, on our coal industry production front, there have been two small drops and two small rises, a small "saddle shape." Facts have proved that when right-leaning slackening ideas raise their heads, production immediately declines; when right-leaning slackening ideas are overcome, production immediately rises. We must remember this lesson, we must adhere to the Party's General Line, adhere to the Great Leap Forward, adhere to putting politics in command, resolutely believe in the masses, rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and fully encourage the enthusiasm of the masses. Under the conditions that material and technical conditions are possible, fully give play to people's subjective initiative. In this way, we will definitely be invincible and unconquerable, and successfully realize the continued Great Leap Forward.

Second, further carry out the large-area high-yield red flag competition movement. The competition must have clear and specific requirements and evaluation conditions. The indicators and measures of the competition must fully mobilize the masses to discuss and achieve "full explanation and large-scale mobilization." In the competition, we must carry forward the communist style of mutual cooperation, mutual promotion, mutual learning, and common improvement. We must achieve old hands leading new hands, skilled hands leading green hands, fast hands leading slow hands, you chasing me, so that the production movement continues to surge, and the ranks of advanced producers continue to grow. Now the national coal industry system already has more than 300 advanced units. It can be believed that by the end of this year, more advanced working faces, advanced work teams, advanced workshops, advanced mines, and advanced mining bureaus will emerge, and a new situation of "overall red" will appear.

Third, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. We must rely on the broad masses of workers and engineering and technical personnel to constantly solve the key problems and weak links in production in order to continuously improve labor efficiency. We must combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work. We must seize and thoroughly understand new technological inventions and creations, and quickly promote them after testing. At the same time, with the widespread development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, production organizations must make corresponding reasonable adjustments, and management systems must make corresponding reasonable reforms. In this regard, we must be a continuous revolutionary and resolutely oppose the conservatism of being content with the status quo and sticking to conventions. The characteristics of the coal industry are that many operations are underground. On the one hand, the labor intensity is relatively high, which requires us to constantly innovate technology and improve operating methods in order to reduce heavy physical labor; on the other hand, there are some unfavorable factors such as water, fire, and gas, which also require us to overcome and conquer them. Therefore, we must carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in production and construction to solve these problems.

Fourth, constantly improve enterprise management. Adhering to the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, adhering to "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," and adhering to carrying out mass movements in enterprises are the "constitution" of our industrial enterprises. We must use these to improve the management of enterprises. In the management of enterprises, we must not only pay attention to increasing output, but also pay attention to improving quality and reducing costs; we must not only carry out vigorous competition movements, but also do a good job in equipment maintenance and safe production; we must not only fully encourage the enthusiasm of employees, but also care for the lives of employees, so that they have both work and rest, and so that they are always energetic in production.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo finally called on the national coal miners to prepare for the continued Great Leap Forward next year while achieving the goal of completing and overfulfilling this year's coal production plan ahead of schedule, and strive to achieve a "good start" and an "overall red" next year.

    高产竞赛要更深更广更持久
    薄一波副总理在全国煤矿职工广播大会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社21日讯　国务院副总理薄一波今天在全国煤炭工业大面积高产红旗竞赛广播大会上讲话。薄一波副总理说：今年3月初，我们曾经在这里举行过一次这样的大会。那次会议以后，迅速地在全国煤炭工业战线上掀起了声势浩大的社会主义劳动竞赛的热潮，因而使煤炭工业在1958年大跃进的基础上，又取得了很大的成就。在8、9月份，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，你们又一次地掀起了新的生产高潮，在生产、基本建设、地质以及机械制造等各个方面，都更进一步地创造出优异的成绩。我谨向你们致以最热烈的祝贺。
    薄一波副总理接着分析了当前全国的政治、经济形势。他说，当前，我们国家的政治经济形势很好，真是欣欣向荣，蒸蒸日上。农业生产虽然遭到了几年来没有遇到过的灾荒，但是粮食、棉花等总产量，在去年大跃进的基础上仍有极大的增长；工业生产、交通运输量不断上升；市场繁荣、活跃。这都充分显示了总路线、大跃进、人民公社的巨大威力，而且正在继续发挥它们的更大的威力。单就工业战线来说，今年前七个月在去年大跃进的基础上，工业生产又有了新的增长。特别是在党的八届八中全会发出“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的号召以后，广大的职工群众热烈地响应党的这个伟大号召，马上就掀起了群众性的增产节约运动的新高潮，促使最近两个多月的生产直线上升。8月份的工业总产值比7月份增长了14％；9月份的工业总产值又比8月份增长了27％。这就使得今年前三个季度的生产任务提前和超额完成了，生产比去年同期有了很大的提高，工业总产值比去年同期提高了45.5％，而且在五十四种主要产品中有二十四种产品的产量已经超过大跃进的1958年的全年产量。
    在煤炭工业战线上，生产任务也完成得很出色。在今年前九个半月的时间里，已经生产了二亿七千四百五十万吨原煤，超过了大跃进的1958年全年产量1.7％。党的八届八中全会鼓舞了你们，从8月份以来，全国煤炭产量迅速增长，按平均日产量计算，7月份是七十八点四万吨，8月份是八十七点七万吨，9月份是一百一十二点九万吨，10月上旬的平均日产量是一百一十四万吨。并且打破了前松后紧，上旬生产水平低于前一个月下旬生产水平的“常规”，生产能够持续不断地高速度地增长。煤炭工业的基本建设也取得了很大的成就，1至9月份，开工和续建矿井的设计生产能力达到二万一千五百七十六万吨，比去年同期增长78.7％；投入生产的矿井生产能力达到一千八百六十九万吨，比去年同期增长25％；投入生产的洗煤厂处理原煤能力达到二千四百五十万吨，比去年同期增长了六点六倍。这些数字充分说明今年煤炭工业的生产、建设，是在继续大跃进。
    全国的形势很好，煤炭工业的形势也很好。我们必须抓住这个大好形势，继续反对右倾，鼓足干劲，积极推广各项行之有效的技术革新和技术革命的先进经验，把正在展开的大面积高产红旗竞赛运动推向新的阶段。力争提前十天到十五天全面完成今年的生产计划，同时，为明年首先为明年第一季度的生产做好准备工作，以便为明年的继续大跃进打下基础。
    薄一波副总理说，煤炭工业是国民经济中一个重要部门，它对国民经济的发展和人民生活的改善有密切的关系。进入第四季度以来，各个经济部门都在以更高的速度发展，需要更多的煤炭；同时进入冬季，广大人民取暖用煤也需要大大增加。因此增产更多的煤炭，满足国民经济日益增长的需要，是全国煤矿职工一个光荣的政治、经济任务。我们相信，全国煤矿职工，一定能够以更加旺盛的革命干劲，实现这个光荣的任务。
    薄一波副总理说，近半年来在全国煤矿中开展起来的大面积高产红旗竞赛运动，是多快好省地发展煤炭工业的重要方法。首先，它使全国煤矿职工，从各个不同的岗位上动员起来，普遍形成你追我赶、比先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛热潮，使落后的赶上了先进的，从而大大地扩大了先进单位的阵容。其次，由于采取了大面积高产的方法，在整个生产过程中，掘进采煤、提升、运输、机电维修等各个生产环节之间，各个部门之间的关系就更加密切了，各级领导干部经常地深入生产第一线，时刻注意各项工业的互相配合全面提高；而广大群众也关心各工种的全面提高，既关心自己单位，也关心别的单位，共产主义大协作的精神大为发扬。再就是，大面积高产运动，可以使增产节约运动开展得具体、生动、活泼，特别是每年分回合地组织竞赛，按阶段地组织评比，就使群众运动能够有节奏地、一浪高一浪地持续发展。
    大面积高产红旗竞赛运动的开展，也大大推动了各煤矿企业的技术革新和技术革命。广大职工针对生产中的薄弱环节，大胆地进行了革新创造。
    对于如何更好地完成第四季度的煤炭生产计划，薄一波副总理提出了四项任务：
    第一，进一步贯彻执行党的“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的指示，把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，更深入、更广泛、更持久地开展增产节约运动。今年在我们煤炭工业生产战线上，曾经有过两小落两小起的小小的“马鞍形”。事实证明，当右倾松劲思想抬头的时候，生产就立刻下降；克服了右倾松劲思想，生产就立刻上升。我们一定要记取这个教训，一定要坚持党的总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持政治挂帅，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，鼓足群众的干劲，在物质技术条件可能的情况下，充分发挥人的主观能动性，这样，我们就一定能够无往不胜、无攻不克，胜利地实现继续大跃进。
    第二，进一步开展大面积高产红旗竞赛运动。竞赛必须有明确的具体要求和评比条件，竞赛的指标和措施一定要充分发动群众讨论，做到“全交代、大动员”。在竞赛中，必须发扬互相协作、互相促进、互相学习、共同提高的共产主义风格。要做到老手带新手，熟手带生手，快手带慢手，你追我赶，使生产运动不断高涨，使先进生产者的队伍不断壮大。现在全国煤炭工业系统已经有了三百多个先进单位，可以相信，到今年年底一定会涌现出更多的先进工作面、先进工作队、先进车间、先进矿井和先进的矿务局，出现“满堂红”的新局面。
    第三，大搞技术革新和技术革命。要依靠广大工人群众、工程技术人员，经常地解决生产中的关键问题和薄弱环节，以不断地提高劳动效率。必须把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来。对新技术的发明创造，必须抓紧、抓透，经过试验迅速予以推广。同时，随着技术革新和技术革命运动的广泛开展，生产组织要进行相应的合理调整，管理制度要进行相应的合理改革，在这方面我们必须作一个不断革命家，坚决反对安于现状、墨守成规的保守主义。煤炭工业的特点，很多是地下作业，一方面，劳动强度比较大，需要我们不断地革新技术，改进操作方法，以减轻笨重的体力劳动；另一方面，存在着一些水、火、瓦斯的不利因素，也需要我们去克服它，战胜它。因此，我们必须在生产建设中，开展技术革新和技术革命来解决这些问题。
    第四，不断地改进企业管理工作。坚持党委领导下的厂长负责制，坚持“两参一改三结合”，坚持在企业中大搞群众运动，这三条是我们工业企业中的“宪法”。要通过这些，来改进企业的管理工作。在企业的管理工作中，既要注意提高产量，又要注意提高质量和降低成本；既要开展轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动，又要做好设备维修和安全生产；既要鼓足职工的干劲，又要关心职工生活，做到有劳有逸，使职工经常精力充沛地进行生产。
    薄一波副总理最后号召全国煤矿职工，在实现提前和超额完成今年煤炭生产计划的同时，要为明年的继续大跃进做好准备，争取实现明年的“开门红”和全年的“满堂红”。
