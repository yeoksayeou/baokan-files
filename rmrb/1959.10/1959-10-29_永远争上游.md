Always Strive for the Top
Wu Lü

    Many representatives of old model workers and old model units are attending this National "Meeting of Heroes." For example, Meng Tai, the old hero of Anshan Iron and Steel, Zhan Shuijing, the lathe operator of Dalian Shipyard who has not produced any defective products or reworked parts for eleven years and eleven months, the Ma Wanshui Group of Longyan Iron Factory, which has "held the championship for ten years and reached the peak nine times," the Ma Hengchang Group of Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, which has completed or overfulfilled the state plan every month for ten consecutive years, and the Zhang Wanfu Rapid Excavation Team of Datong Mining Bureau, which has had ten years of all-around success, etc. These old model workers and old model units have maintained their advanced level and advanced titles for ten years as if it were a single day, and they truly deserve to be red flags that never fade!

    Being advanced for ten years is not an easy task; the most important thing is to have a red heart that always strives for the top. There is no end to striving for the top. New production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies, and production is always in a state of development and change. However, only those who have the great ambition to always strive for the top can remain at the top in the long river of continuous production development. Those who are satisfied with a little bit of achievement and stop after a little taste of success are often thrown downstream by the tide of revolution. Setting a great ambition to always strive for the top is the prerequisite for continuously maintaining advancement. Looking at these old model workers and old model units who have won ten years of advancement and maintained ten years of honor, is there a red line running through their year-after-year production struggles? Yes, it is: always strive for the top.

    Over the past ten years, these old model workers and old model units have not been without difficulties. Take the Zhang Wanfu Excavation Team as an example: the history of the Zhang Wanfu Team is a history of constantly fighting against difficulties and moving from victory to victory. The first hurdle of rapid excavation was to find ways to improve drilling techniques, increase the blasting rate, and speed up the excavation progress. They experimented with new blasting methods; one trial failed, and a second trial failed; finally, they developed the "relay slotting method," which succeeded and accelerated the excavation speed. However, a new problem arose: transportation could not keep up. Research! Experiment! Finally, a "segmented relay transportation method" emerged, and they took another step forward. Every time they arrive at a new work surface, they encounter new and different difficulties. Either the coal quality is hard, or there are many interlayers of rock, or there is too much water. However, these kinds of difficulties have not been able to defeat this famous rapid excavation team. They are never afraid of any kind of difficulty; they overcome the difficulty and took a step forward. Being afraid of difficulties means that one cannot talk about always striving for the top. Never being afraid of difficulties, never being complacent, this is what it means to always strive for the top. Hundreds and thousands of old model workers and old model units have all come this way.

    Our era is an era of heroic figures. The emergence of new heroic figures is a characteristic; advanced becoming more advanced, with many old model workers always leading the way in the struggle to complete the state plan over the years, is also a characteristic. This scene of new heroes emerging one after another and old heroes becoming more vigorous as they get older is very exciting. We hope that old model workers will spur themselves on, maintain their advancement, and hope that rising stars will learn from the example of these old model workers and never fall behind. This is not just a matter of individuals maintaining their honor, but a matter related to the continuous progress of the entire country's construction cause. "Trickles of water converge into rivers." The state's planned tasks are assigned to thousands of enterprises to complete; the enterprises' plans must be guaranteed by the plans of workshops, groups, and even individuals; the annual plan is based on the quarterly plan and the monthly plan; the monthly plan is based on the ten-day plan and the daily plan. Thousands of advanced producers always striving for the top, uniting all employees, and completing and overfulfilling the state plan year by year, month by month, ten-day period by ten-day period, and day by day, is the guarantee for the forever high-speed development of our country's socialist construction cause.

    永远争上游
    吴滤
    出席这次全国“群英会”的，有许多都是老模范和老模范单位的代表。如鞍钢的老英雄孟泰，十一年又十一个月没有出过废品和返手活的大连造船厂的车工詹水晶，“十年居冠军，九次登高峰”的龙烟铁厂的马万水小组，连续十年月月完成或超额完成国家计划的齐齐哈尔第二机床厂马恒昌小组，十年满堂红的大同矿务局张万福快速掘进队等等。这些老模范和老模范单位，十年如一日，一直保持着先进的水平和先进的称号，真不愧是永不褪色的红旗！
    十年先进，这不是一件容易的事情；最重要的，需要一颗永远争上游的红心。上游无止境。新的生产技术总是不断地代替着旧的生产技术，生产总是永远处在发展变动的状态中的。但是，只有立下了永远争上游的大志的人，才能在生产不断发展的长河中永居于上游。浅尝辄止，满足于一丝半点成就的人，往往要被革命的浪潮抛到下游。立永远争上游的大志，是不断保持先进的前提。试看这些赢得十年先进，保持十年荣誉的老模范和老模范单位，在他们一年又一年的生产斗争中，有没有一根贯穿始终的红线呢？有，这就是：永远争上游。
    十年来，在这些老模范和老模范单位中，并不是没有困难的。拿张万福掘进队来说吧：张万福队的历史，就是一部不断向困难搏斗，从胜利走向胜利的历史。快速掘进的第一关是要设法改进打眼技术，提高爆破率，加快掘进的进度。他们试验新的爆破方法，一次试行，不成；二次试行，不成；最后，研究出“接力掏槽法”，成了，加快了掘进速度。然而，新的问题又出现了：运输跟不上。研究啊！试验啊！最后出来了一个“分段接力运输法”，又前进了一步。每到一个新的工作面，又会遇到新的不同的困难。不是煤质硬，就是夹石多，再不然就是水大。但是，这样和那样的困难，并没有能难倒这支著名的快速掘进队。他们从不害怕任何一种困难；克服了困难，前进了一步。害怕困难，就谈不到永远争上游。永远不怕困难，永远不自满，这才是永远争上游。成百上千的老模范和老模范单位，都是从这条路上走过来的。
    我们的时代是一个英雄辈出的时代。新的英雄人物风起云涌，这是一个特色；先进再先进，许多老模范在历年完成国家计划的斗争中一直走在前面，又是一个特色。这一派新英雄层出不穷，老英雄老当益壮的气势，十分地激动人心。我们希望老模范扬鞭直前，保持先进，希望后起之秀学习这些老模范的榜样，永不掉队。这不是一个个人保持荣誉的问题，而是一个关系着整个国家的建设事业不断前进的问题。“涓滴之水，汇成江河”。国家的计划任务是分配由千千万万个企业去完成的；企业的计划是要由车间、小组、甚至个人的计划来保证的；年度计划建立在季度计划和月计划的基础上；月计划又建立在旬计划、日计划的基础上。千千万万先进生产者永远争上游，团结全体职工，逐年、逐月、逐旬、逐日完成和超额完成国家计划，正是我国社会主义建设事业永远高速度发展的保证。
