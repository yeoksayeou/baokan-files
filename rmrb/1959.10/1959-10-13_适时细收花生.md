　　Timely and Careful Peanut Harvesting
　　By Our Staff Commentator

　　Peanut leaves are lush, flowers are blooming, and a bumper harvest is promising. Currently, it is the harvest season. Harvesting peanuts well is one of the important items of the "Three Autumns" work, and it is an important battle to seize oil crops, which must be given sufficient attention.

　　What does it mean to harvest peanuts well? First, it must be timely; second, it must be meticulous. The flowering period of peanuts lasts for about two months; flowering occurs at different times, and fruiting also occurs sooner or later. If the harvest is too early, the later-formed fruits will not be full, the fruit set rate will be low, which will affect the yield and quality; if the harvest is too late, not only will the stems and fruit pegs (i.e., ovary stalks) easily wither and break, increasing the difficulty of harvesting, but also the harvested pods will easily be damaged by frost, reducing the quality, especially in rainy or low-lying areas, which will increase the loss of rotten fruits. Peanut fruits grow in the soil and hang on the vines, so they must be dug from the soil and collected from the soil, and they must also be threshed (or picked) from the vines. If the harvest is rough, many pods will be lost, causing great losses.

　　Some people think that peanut fruits grow in the soil, and they have never been completely harvested, so losses are inevitable. Therefore, they do not actively try to find ways to harvest more. In fact, it is entirely possible to harvest peanuts cleanly. Last year, the Taohua Management District of Gejia People's Commune in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, planted a total of 1,200 mu of peanuts. Due to timely harvesting and meticulous harvesting and threshing, it basically achieved a 100% harvest in a ten-year good harvest. The peanut yield of the entire management area was more than 45% higher per mu than that of neighboring areas with rough harvests, and the quality of the peanuts was good, with an average germination rate of 95%. Such examples are not isolated. If something can be done, why not actively do it? Why should peanuts that can be recovered be abandoned in the field for nothing? Some people also think that this year's harvest is abundant, and wasting a little is not a big deal. Therefore, they do not actively take measures to prevent possible losses and waste in the harvesting process. This kind of thinking is contrary to the socialist thought of safeguarding collective interests. Accumulation is a truth known to all. If one person wastes one jin, the amount will be staggering when calculated for a commune or a region. In order to ensure a bumper peanut harvest this year, we must resolutely oppose this indifferent attitude. According to a typical survey conducted in Beiliu County, Guangxi, during the early peanut harvest this year, the loss of rotten fruits due to late harvesting reached 50 jin per mu. According to a survey in Zhangpu, Hui'an, and other counties in Fujian Province, some communes and teams harvested peanuts coarsely, with an average of 30 to 40 jin lost per mu, and some even more. At a loss of 30 jin per mu, 1,000 mu of peanuts would lose 30,000 jin. If the price per 100 jin is calculated at 12 yuan, the income would be reduced by 360,000 yuan. This is a considerable loss for a commune or a team. Implementing meticulous harvesting and recovering all the peanuts that are about to be obtained not only increases the production of oil crops, but also increases the income of the members, which is a win-win situation.

　　To harvest peanuts well, in addition to grasping the timing for timely and rapid harvesting according to local climate and peanut maturity, it is also necessary to truly achieve "three cleans" (clean digging, clean pulling, clean threshing or clean picking) and "three no losses" (no loss of fruits underground, no loss of fruits above ground, no loss of fruits on the plants), to prevent all losses and waste. The practice of the Taohua Management District of Gejia People's Commune in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, is: large field peanuts are harvested three or four days before the frost, and during the harvest, deep digging and fine soil shaking are carried out to pick up fallen fruits; after each piece of land is harvested, it is harrowed twice vertically and horizontally, and fallen fruits are picked up as the harrowing proceeds; after harrowing, it is shallowly划一遍with a rake and then finely harrowed vertically and horizontally to pick up fruits. This achieves no fallen fruits on the ground, and all grains are returned to the barn. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively improve harvesting methods and improve harvesting tools. The harvesting methods and harvesting tools with significant effects created in some places last year should be actively promoted.

　　Selecting and retaining sufficient high-quality seeds during the harvest period is an important material basis for ensuring increased peanut production next year. In order to promote a significant increase in peanut production next year, all localities should do a good job in selecting and retaining seeds. The number of seeds selected and retained can generally be determined according to the local planting plan for next year and the requirements for reasonable close planting this year, and good seeds should be selected and retained in sufficient quantities on the principle of ensuring the peanut planting area without wasting oil crops. At the same time, relevant departments in various localities should also control a certain amount of high-quality seeds to be prepared for necessary adjustments during the sowing season. Before the large field peanut harvest, should first conduct selective sampling or block selection, the standards are: timely sowing, uniform growth, consistent maturity, high fruit set rate, no pests and diseases, no rotten fruit. After selection, the production team or professional team will be responsible for harvesting in a timely manner before the frost, so that it will not be damaged by frost; and it should be harvested, dried, and stored separately. Strengthen the responsibility system for保管管 to ensure the quality of peanut seeds.

　　Adhering to putting politics in command and strengthening leadership are no exception in the work of harvesting peanuts. Last year, when peanuts matured in Hong'an County, Hubei, the county party committee timely put forward the slogan of "grabbing and quickly harvesting, bumper harvest and rich harvest, careful harvesting and more harvesting," and adopted the method of "one unification" (unified leadership), "three divisions" (division into areas, division into war zones, division of tasks), and "four concentrations" (concentration of labor, concentration of tools, concentration of draft animals, concentration of harvests) to make the peanut harvesting work fast and good. This experience can be used as a reference in key producing areas. As for general producing areas, under the principle of overall arrangement, leadership should also be implemented by line, and a sound responsibility system should be established to ensure that each piece of land is well harvested. While strengthening leadership, it is necessary to firmly grasp the central link of labor organization. On the one hand, we must consider that the entire "Three Autumns" work is very tight, and the labor required for harvesting peanuts is relatively large; on the other hand, we must also understand that both strong and weak laborers play a role in the peanut harvesting process (the strong can dig peanuts, and the weak can pick peanuts and pick up peanuts). As long as the superiority of the commune is fully utilized and the labor potential is tapped, the difficulty of insufficient labor can be overcome, and the "Three Autumns" work can be done comprehensively.

　　适时细收花生
　　本报评论员
    花生叶茂花盛，丰收大有希望；目前，已到了收获季节。收好花生，是“三秋”工作的重要项目之一，是夺取油料的一次重要战役，必须予以足够的注意。
    怎样才算把花生收好了？一要适时；二要精细。花生的开花时期长达两个月左右；开花有先有后，结果也有早有迟。如果收获过早，后结的果还没有长饱，成果率低，会影响产量和质量；如果收获过晚，不仅茎蔓和果针（即子房柄）容易枯断，增加收刨时的困难，而且收起的荚果，也容易受冻，降低品质，尤其在多雨或地势低洼的地区，更会增多烂果损失。花生果长在土里，挂在蔓上，既要从土里挖，从土里收，又要从蔓上摔（或摘）下来，如果收获粗糙，就会遗落很多荚果，造成很大损失。
    有些人认为花生果长在土里，历来都收不净，损失不可避免。因此，他们便不积极想办法力争多收。其实，花生收得净是完全可以做到的。去年山东省文登县葛家人民公社桃花管理区共种了一千二百亩花生，由于收获及时，并且做到精收细打，基本上达到十成年景十成收。全管理区的花生产量，比邻近地区收获粗糙的每亩要多产45％以上，而且花生的质量好，平均发芽率达到95％。这样的事例并不是个别的。能够办到的事，为什么不去积极办呢？能够收回来的花生，为什么要白白丢弃在地里呢？还有些人认为今年丰收了，浪费一点不算什么。因此，他们也不积极地采取措施，防止在收获中间可能发生的损失浪费现象。这种思想，是与维护集体利益的社会主义思想相违背的。积少成多，是人人皆知的真理。要是一个人浪费一斤，一个公社或一个地区来计算，数量之大就很惊人。为了保证今年花生丰产丰收，要坚决反对这种满不在乎的作风。据今年广西北流县收获早花生的时候的典型调查，由于晚收烂果，每亩损失达五十斤。又据福建省漳浦、惠安等县调查，有些社、队收获花生时做得粗糙，平均一亩地收漏的达三、四十斤，有的更多。以每亩损失三十斤计，一千亩花生就要损失三万斤。如果每百斤的价格按十二元折算，就要少收入三十六万元。这对一个社、一个队来说，是一笔不小的损失。实行精收细收，把即将到手的花生全部拿回来，不但增产了油料，而且也增加了社员的收入，这是一举两得的好事。
  要收好花生，除了要根据当地气候和花生成熟情况，掌握时机及时快收以外，还要切实做到三净 （刨净、拉净、摔净或摘净）、三不丢（地下不丢果、地上不丢果、棵上不丢果），防止一切损失浪费现象。山东文登县葛家人民公社桃花管理区的作法是：大田花生在霜降前三、四天及时进行收获，收获时做到深刨细抖土，拾净落果；每块地收获完了以后，用耙纵横耙两遍，随耙随拾落果；耙后又用耧浅划一遍，再纵横细耙拾果。这样就达到地无落果，颗粒归仓。同时，还要积极改进收获方法，改良收获工具。去年一些地方创造的效果显著的收获方法和收获工具，应该积极推广。
    在收获期间选留足够的优良种子，是保证下年花生增产的重要物质基础。为了促进明年花生产量大大提高，各地都应该做好选种留种工作。选留种子的数量，一般可以根据当地明年种植计划和今年合理密植的要求，在既保证花生的播种面积，又不浪费油料的原则下，挑好留足。同时，各地有关部门还要掌握一定数量的优良种子，以备播种时期作必要的调剂。在大田花生收获以前，要先进行片选或块选，标准是：播种适时，生长整齐，成熟一致，成果率高，没有病虫害，没有烂果。选定后即责成生产小队或专业组负责，在霜冻以前及时收获，不使受冻；并且做到单收、单晒、单独保管。加强保管责任制，确保花生种子的质量。
    坚持政治挂帅，加强领导，在收获花生的工作中也不能例外。去年，湖北红安县当花生成熟时期，县委及时提出了“抢收快收，丰产丰收，细收多收”的口号，采取一统（统一领导）、三分（分片、分战区、分任务）、四集中（劳力集中、工具集中、耕畜集中、收获集中）的办法，使花生收获工作做得又快又好。这个经验，在重点产区可以参考运用。至于一般产区，也应该在全面安排的原则下，实行分线领导，建立健全的责任制，确保块块收好。在加强领导的同时，必须切实抓住劳动组织这一中心环节。一方面要考虑到整个“三秋”工作都很紧张，收获花生所需的劳力又比较多；另一方面也要了解在收获花生过程中强弱劳力都有作用（强的可以刨花生，弱的可以摘花生和拣花生）。只要充分运用公社的优越性，发掘劳动潜力，劳力不足的困难一定可以克服，“三秋”工作一定能够全面做好。
