    Qinghai Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting Arranges Future Work to Make Production Surge Wave Upon Wave

    This newspaper reports The Fifth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Eighth Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Lushan from August 22 to September 20. The meeting listened to the transmission of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party by Comrade Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, studied the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and Chairman Mao's instructions. After serious discussion, all participants unanimously and enthusiastically supported and resolutely implemented them. The meeting affirmed the great achievements since the Great Leap Forward last year, analyzed the current favorable situation, and criticized the right-leaning thoughts of some comrades, which gave all comrades present a profound education. The meeting called on Party organizations at all levels, all Party members, all cadres, and the people of the province to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, vigorously launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy, set off an even greater production upsurge, and complete and overfulfill the 1959 Leap Forward plan.
    The meeting held that in 1958, the province achieved unprecedentedly great victories on all fronts of socialist construction. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, the national economy continued to leap forward in 1959. The broad masses were enthusiastic, high-spirited, and in very good shape. From January to August, the total industrial output value of the province increased by 44% compared with the same period last year. The output of many important industrial products such as pig iron and coal increased significantly compared with the same period last year, and the quality also increased month by month; ten new iron and steel industrial bases in Nanchang, Xinyu, Pingxiang, Ganzhong, Fengcheng, etc., have been successively completed, and most of them have been put into production. At the same time, hundreds of small-scale iron smelting plants have entered the "small-scale foreign group" stage after rectification and improvement. Jiangxi Province, which used to be a blank sheet of paper in the iron and steel industry, has now drawn the newest and most beautiful picture of the iron and steel industry. The province's 1,191 people's communes have rapidly embarked on a healthy and consolidated road after the commune rectification work, and are increasingly showing their great superiority. The province's early rice has achieved a widespread bumper harvest; the late rice and autumn crops have a larger sown area than last year, and are sown early, sown well, and carefully managed, and are generally growing well. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a vigorous overproduction movement was launched in the vast countryside, with production upsurges of adding indicators, adding measures, vowing to win high yields, and determined to overproduce sweeping the land.
    According to the above-mentioned favorable situation and the completion of the national economic plan, the meeting studied the various planned targets for this year and determined that the grain production this year should reach 21 billion catties, an increase of 11.7% compared with last year, and the cotton output should reach 10,000 dan, an increase of 15% compared with last year; pig iron (Class I iron) should be 200,000 tons, an increase of 70% compared with last year, and coal should be 8.2 million tons, an increase of 20% compared with last year. The meeting emphasized that this is a plan for continued leap forward. Industry, agriculture, transportation, and all sectors of the national economy must strive to increase production and resolutely ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this plan. In agriculture, vigorously carry out the overproduction movement centered on the field management of late rice, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of late rice, miscellaneous grains, and various cash crops. Make preparations for autumn harvesting and autumn plowing as early as possible, try to expand the sowing area in autumn and winter, vigorously carry out autumn and winter fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction, and lay a solid foundation for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year. In industry, seize the production of steel, coal, machinery, timber, and other heavy industrial products. It is required that the daily output of pig iron in the province should be increased to more than 1,000 tons in the near future, and the daily output of coal should be increased to more than 30,000 tons; actively increase the production of light industrial and handicraft products. Transportation, commerce, scientific research, culture and education, and health work should all adopt effective measures suitable to their own departments, and resolutely complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan.
    The meeting called on the people of the province to mobilize urgently, overcome right-leaning slackening emotions, seize every minute and second, and quickly launch a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to overfulfill this year's leap forward plan and prepare for the continued Great Leap Forward next year. First, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously grasp ideological mobilization, and vigorously carry out mass movements. The meeting required Party organizations at all levels throughout the province to seize the opportunity to deeply publicize the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party among all Party members, all cadres, and the people of the province, and carry out a massive, large-scale, lively and dynamic propaganda movement to create a heat wave where everyone supports the general line, everyone supports the Great Leap Forward, everyone supports the people's commune, everyone supports the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and everyone resolutely struggles to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule. Second, take anti-rightist drive and boosting morale as the guiding principle, and implement the spirit of anti-rightist drive and boosting morale into all aspects of work. Resolutely counter the attacks of domestic and foreign enemies on the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and resolutely overcome right-leaning emotions. Third, earnestly strengthen the Party's leadership over the increase production and practice economy movement, with the first secretary taking personal command and firmly grasping the movement. Leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, and work with the masses to specifically solve problems in the movement and constantly promote the progress of the movement. Fourth, Party organizations at all levels must enthusiastically support and cherish the political enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of the people, and while grasping production, earnestly care for the lives of the masses and conscientiously solve problems in the lives of the masses.
    The meeting conducted a full and enthusiastic discussion on further carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement and realizing this year's leap forward plan. The comrades participating in the meeting unanimously expressed that they would boost even greater revolutionary enthusiasm, overcome all difficulties, and work with the broad masses to fight hard for a hundred days and do everything possible to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan.

    This newspaper reports: The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Second Twelfth Enlarged Plenary Meeting from August 10 to September 16. This meeting was conducted under the guidance of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The meeting conveyed and studied the resolutions and relevant documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The comrades participating in the meeting received profound education and great encouragement, enhanced their confidence and strength in accelerating socialist construction, and unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the spirit and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and resolutely struggled for their complete realization.
    After full discussion, the meeting deeply and systematically summarized the great victories and rich experiences of Qinghai Province's Great Leap Forward, people's communization, the socialist revolution movement in pastoral areas, and the continued leap forward this year in 1958, verified the statistical figures of grain and livestock in 1958, and adjusted the planned targets of grain and livestock in 1959 according to the implementation of the plan in the first eight months of this year, studied the guidelines and arrangements for economic construction in the next three years; conducted in-depth inspection and criticism of the right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning opportunist errors of some cadres, defended the Party's general line, and further enhanced the Party's unity. The meeting finally adopted corresponding resolutions.
    The meeting held that the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of Qinghai Province's national economy in 1958 and the continued leap forward this year fully proved that the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is completely correct. In 1958, the total grain output, after verification, reached 1.7 billion catties, an increase of 32% compared with 1957. The total industrial output value increased 1.7 times compared with 1957. The number of industrial enterprises above the county level suddenly increased from 123 to 838. In particular, the large-scale iron and steel smelting movement opened a new page in the history of Qinghai's industrial construction. It not only smelted iron and steel for the first time in history, trained people, but also discovered a large number of mineral resources, cultivated a large number of technical forces, and gained experience. On this basis, several small-scale iron and steel bases were established from indigenous to foreign methods, with equipment capacity that can produce more than 90,000 tons of pig iron and 60,000 tons of steel annually. This year, all departments of the national economy have achieved great achievements on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year: agricultural production has seen more thousand-catty mu and large-scale high-yield fields, and the total grain output will be even greater than last year. The total industrial output value in the first eight months of this year increased by 71.25% compared with the same period last year. More new products were trial-produced, and the quality was significantly improved. The mileage of newly built roads was 726 kilometers, and the freight turnover increased two times compared with the same period last year. In particular, the opening of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway to Xining has a significant impact on Qinghai's future construction.
    The meeting pointed out that with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, Qinghai's agricultural areas realized people's communization in one fell swoop; the pastoral areas realized the collective ownership of the means of production and began to move towards people's communization.
    The meeting held that the great achievements made by Qinghai in all aspects since the Great Leap Forward completely shattered the vicious slanders and attacks of domestic and foreign reactionaries on the Party's general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune.
    The meeting especially emphasized that for the realization of this year's continued leap forward, the main danger at present is the growth of right-leaning opportunist thoughts among some cadres. Right-leaning opportunists oppose the Party's general line, oppose the Great Leap Forward, oppose the people's commune, oppose the socialist revolution in pastoral areas, and oppose the Party's leadership and putting politics in command. The meeting forcefully criticized these errors with a large number of facts. The meeting held that criticizing and overcoming right-leaning opportunist thoughts is the main combat task of the entire Party at present. As long as right-leaning thoughts are thoroughly eliminated, a greater leap forward can be realized.
    According to the current situation in Qinghai, the meeting fully discussed and specifically arranged the guidelines and tasks for future work. The meeting pointed out that according to the current situation in Qinghai, we should vigorously strengthen the agricultural front, develop agricultural production at high speed, increase grain output, and correspondingly actively develop oil crops, vegetables, and other cash crops to meet the growing needs of the people. In pastoral areas, animal husbandry production should take "strengthening" as the guiding principle, and continue to launch a production upsurge centered on fattening, breeding, and protecting fetuses. On the premise of ensuring animal husbandry production, actively develop agricultural production, and gradually achieve grain self-sufficiency in areas where grain can be grown. The focus of local industry should be to serve agricultural and animal husbandry production, produce a large number of agricultural and animal husbandry machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc., and vigorously develop light industry and handicraft production. The production of petroleum, copper, potash fertilizer, sulfur, asbestos, red alum, etc., which are urgently needed by the state, should also be vigorously developed.
    The meeting was satisfied to see that, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai are more high-spirited and full of energy. After large-scale mobilization, large-scale oath-taking rallies, large-scale evaluations, and large-scale inspections, a new upsurge of mass-based production increase and economy practice has been fully formed.
    The meeting pointed out that the key to completing and overfulfilling this year's plan and continuing the Great Leap Forward lies in continuing to strengthen the Party's leadership and vigorously carry out mass movements. To this end, the entire Party and all the people must continue to deeply implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, strengthen the Party's leadership, enhance the Party's unity, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously carry out mass movements. In the spirit of "energy can be boosted but not泄", we must always enthusiastically protect the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres, always act as promoters, unite the masses to constantly overcome right-leaning emotions and right-leaning thoughts, boost greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and make the upsurge of production increase and economy practice surge wave upon wave.

    江西省委扩大会议号召抓紧一分一秒大搞增产节约运动
    青海省委扩大会议安排今后工作要使生产一浪高过一浪
    本报讯　中共江西省委五届八次全体（扩大）会议，8月22日至9月20日在庐山举行。会议听取了省委第一书记杨尚奎同志关于八届八中全会的传达，学习了八届八中全会的各项决议和毛主席的指示，经过认真讨论，一致热烈拥护，坚决贯彻执行。会议肯定了去年大跃进以来的伟大成绩，分析了当前有利形势，批判了部分同志的右倾思想，使到会全体同志受到了一次深刻的教育。会议号召全省各级党组织、全体党员、全体干部和全省人民，坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的各项决议，反右倾，鼓干劲，大力开展增产节约的群众运动，掀起更大的生产高潮，完成和超额完成1959年跃进计划。
    会议认为，1958年全省在社会主义建设的各个战线上取得了空前巨大的胜利。在去年大跃进的基础上，1959年国民经济在继续跃进。广大群众热情奔放，意气风发。形势好得很。1至8月份，全省工业总产值比去年同期增长44％，生铁、煤炭等许多重要工业产品的产量都比去年同期有很大增长，质量也在逐月上升；南昌、新喻、萍乡、赣中、丰城等十个新的钢铁工业基地已先后建成，大部分投入了生产。同时，数以百计的小型炼铁厂经过整顿提高，已进入“小洋群”阶段。过去在钢铁工业方面是张白纸的江西省，现在已绘出了最新最美丽的钢铁工业图画。全省一千一百九十一个人民公社经过整社工作，迅速走上了健全、巩固的道路，越来越显著地显示了它的巨大优越性。全省早稻获得了普遍大丰收；晚稻和大秋作物，播种面积比去年大，并且种得早、种得好、管得细，普遍生长良好。党的八届八中全会后，广大农村掀起了热火朝天的超产运动，加指标、加措施、誓夺高产、定要超产的生产高潮风起云涌。
    会议根据上述有利形势及国民经济计划的完成情况，对今年各项计划指标又做了研究，确定：今年粮食生产量要求达到二百一十亿斤，比去年增长11.7％，棉花产量达到万担，比去年增长15％；生铁（一类铁）二十万吨，比去年增长70％，煤八百二十万吨，比去年增长20％。会议强调指出：这是一个继续跃进的计划，工业、农业、交通运输和国民经济各部门，必须努力增加生产，坚决保证完成和超额完成这一计划。农业方面，大力开展以晚稻田间管理为中心的超额增产运动，力争晚稻、杂粮和各种经济作物全面丰收。及早作好秋收秋耕各种准备，尽力扩大秋冬播种面积，大力开展秋冬积肥和兴修水利工作，为明年农业生产的继续跃进打下扎实的基础。工业方面，抓紧钢铁、煤炭、机械、木材和其他重工业产品的生产，要求全省生铁日产量在最近提高到一千吨以上，煤日产量提高到三万吨以上；积极增加轻工业和手工业产品的生产。交通运输、商业、科学研究、文化教育和卫生工作，都要采取适合本部门情况的有效措施，坚决完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划。
    会议号召全省人民紧急动员起来，克服右倾松劲情绪，抓紧一分一秒的时间，迅速掀起一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动，为超额完成今年的跃进计划和准备明年的继续大跃进而斗争。一、坚持政治挂帅，大抓思想动员，大搞群众运动。会议要求全省各级党组织抓紧时机，在全体党员、全体干部和全省人民中深入宣传党的八届八中全会的决议，开展一个声势浩大、规模壮阔、生动活泼的宣传运动，造成一个人人拥护总路线、人人拥护大跃进、人人拥护人民公社、人人拥护党的八届八中全会决议、人人为提前完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划而坚决奋斗的热潮。二、以反右倾鼓干劲为纲，把反右倾鼓干劲的精神贯彻到各个方面的工作中去。坚决反击国内外敌人对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的攻击，坚决克服右倾情绪。三、切实加强党对增产节约运动的领导，第一书记亲自挂帅，把运动狠狠地抓起来。各级领导干部必须深入基层，深入群众，同群众一起，具体解决运动中的问题，不断地推动运动前进。四、各级党组织对于人民群众的这种政治热情和革命干劲，必须热情的支持和爱护，在抓生产的同时切实关心群众生活，认真解决群众生活中的问题。
    会议对于进一步开展增产节约运动，实现今年的跃进计划，进行了充分而热烈的讨论。与会同志一致表示：要鼓足更大的革命干劲，排除一切困难，与广大群众一道，大战一百天，千方百计地完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划。　（李久泽）
    本报讯　中国共产党青海省委员会，从8月10日到9月16日举行了第二届第十二次扩大的全体会议。这次会议是在党的八届八中全会的精神指导下进行的。会议传达和学习了党的八届八中全会的决议和有关文件，与会同志受到了深刻的教育和极大的鼓舞，增强了加速社会主义建设的信心和力量，一致表示，衷心拥护党的八届八中全会的精神和决议，并坚决为其彻底实现而英勇奋斗。
    会议经过充分讨论，深入系统地总结了青海省1958年大跃进、人民公社化、牧区社会主义革命运动和今年继续跃进的伟大胜利及其丰富经验，核实了1958年粮食、牲畜的统计数字，并根据今年前八个月计划执行情况，调整了1959年粮食、牲畜的计划指标，研究了今后三年经济建设的方针和安排；对某些干部中的右倾思想和右倾机会主义的错误，进行了深入的检查和批判，保卫了党的总路线，进一步增强了党的团结。会议最后通过了相应的决议。
    会议认为，青海省1958年国民经济的全面大跃进和今年的继续跃进，充分证明了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线是完全正确的。1958年，粮食总产量经过核实达到十七亿斤，比1957年增长32％。工业总产值比1957年增长一点七倍，县营以上的工业企业，由一百二十三个突增至八百三十八个。特别是大炼钢铁运动，揭开了青海工业建设的新史页，不但在历史上第一次炼出了钢铁，锻炼了人，而且发现了大量的矿藏资源，培养了大批技术力量，取得了经验，在此基础上，由土到洋，建立了几处小型钢铁基地，设备能力可以年产生铁九万余吨，钢六万吨。今年国民经济各部门，在去年大跃进的基础上，又取得了伟大的成就：农业生产出现了更多的千斤亩和大面积丰产田，粮食总产量将比去年获得更大丰收。今年前八个月的工业总产值，又比去年同期增长71.25％，试制了更多的新产品，质量显著提高，新修公路通车里程七百二十六公里，运输周转量比去年同期增长两倍，特别是兰青铁路通车西宁，对青海今后建设具有重大作用。
    会议指出，1958年随着工农业的大跃进，青海农业区一举实现了人民公社化；牧业区实现了生产资料集体所有制，并开始走向人民公社化。
    会议认为，大跃进以来青海在各方面所取得的伟大成就，彻底粉碎了国内外反动派对党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的恶毒污蔑和攻击。
    会议特别强调指出，对于实现今年的继续跃进来说，当前的主要危险是在某些干部中滋长着右倾机会主义思想。右倾机会主义者，反对党的总路线，反对大跃进，反对人民公社，反对牧业区社会主义革命，反对党的领导和政治挂帅。对于这些错误，会议以大量事实，有力地进行了批判。会议认为批判和克服右倾机会主义思想，是当前全党的主要战斗任务。只要彻底肃清右倾思想，就能实现更大跃进。
    会议根据青海目前形势，对今后各项工作的方针、任务，作了充分讨论和具体安排。会议指出，根据青海目前形势，应该大力加强农业战线，高速度地发展农业生产，增加粮食产量，相应地积极发展油料、蔬菜和其他经济作物，以适应人民日益增长的需要。在牧业区，畜牧业生产应以“壮”为纲，继续掀起以抓膘、配种、保胎为中心的生产高潮。在保证畜牧业生产的前提下，积极发展农业生产，能种粮食的地区，逐步达到粮食自给。地方工业的重点应该是为农牧业生产服务，大量生产农牧机具、化肥、农药等，大力发展轻工业、手工业生产。对国家迫切需要的石油、铜、钾肥、硫磺、石棉、红矾等生产，也应大力发展。
    会议满意地看到，在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，青海各级干部和各族人民群众，更加意气风发，干劲冲天。经过大动员、大誓师、大评比、大检查，一个大规模的群众性的增产节约新高潮已经全面形成。
    会议指出，完成和超额完成今年计划和继续大跃进，关键在于继续加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。为此，全党全民必须继续深入贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，加强党的领导，增强党的团结，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。本着“气可鼓而不可泄”的精神，任何时候都要满腔热情地保护广大群众和干部的革命积极性，永远要当促进派，团结群众不断克服右倾情绪、右倾思想，鼓足更大的革命干劲，使增产节约高潮一浪高过一浪。
