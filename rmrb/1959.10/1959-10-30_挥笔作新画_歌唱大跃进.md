    Wielding Brushes to Create New Paintings, Singing Praises of the Great Leap Forward
    (Our Dispatch) An excellent set of historical paintings, "Starting from Scratch," exhibited at the Northeast Three Provinces Art Exhibition held in Harbin, has won high praise from artists and audiences alike.
    This set of historical paintings truthfully reflects the deeds of the nationally renowned heroic factory, the Liaoning Benxi Alloy Factory, which started from scratch. In 1950, this factory was founded with just one large pot, two ladles, three molds, and four workers. After overcoming many technical and equipment difficulties, it produced many precious alloys. Now, it has become one of the largest industrial enterprises in Benxi City. Many of the unique alloys produced by this factory supply more than a thousand important enterprises across the country, and are also exported to North Korea, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia.
    The "Starting from Scratch" series consists of fourteen paintings, which truthfully depict three character figures. One is a stubborn, calm communist party member, a "Veteran Eighth Route Army soldier" (demobilized serviceman), full of confidence in his career and possessing excellent revolutionary qualities; another is a young worker who is eager to accept new things, dares to think and act, and is willing to study diligently; and the third is an old worker who works steadily and diligently. "It Won't Fail!" is the first climax of the series, and also the most brilliant painting. It depicts that after several unsuccessful experiments with advanced alloys, some individuals were frightened by the difficulties and wanted to quit. The author very cleverly organized the scene, placing a large broken pot meaningfully at the forefront of the painting. However, the experiments did not stop; the smoke and blazing fire in the distance suggest that the heroes are still continuing to persist in the experiments. The three protagonists simultaneously appear in front of the "deserter" who is weak in will and has already packed his luggage. The kind-hearted old worker's feelings are implicit; he makes an extremely regretful gesture, wanting to persuade the person who is about to leave at the last minute. Beside him, the "Veteran Eighth Route Army soldier" looks as if he has already said what he needed to say. He stands with his hands on his hips, staring fiercely at the "deserter" with angry eyes. The young worker did not put down his work, but simply looked up and glanced contemptuously. The image of the "deserter" is both satirical and dramatic; he lowers his head, carrying his luggage in one hand. Although his back is turned, his inner thoughts are revealed.
    The authors of the "Starting from Scratch" series are seven seventeen- or eighteen-year-old students from the high school department of the Shenyang Luxun Academy of Fine Arts. At the beginning of this year, in order to create excellent works to celebrate National Day, they combined their creation class with several months of living, eating, and working alongside the workers at the Benxi Alloy Factory. Seeing the workers' selfless work enthusiasm and hearing the workers talk about the heroic factory history inspired them greatly. During the creation process, they often sought the workers' opinions on their works and invited factory leaders to discuss the works. After repeated revisions, they created this excellent set of paintings. (Attached images)

### 挥笔作新画　歌唱大跃进

    挥笔作新画　歌唱大跃进
    本报讯　在哈尔滨举办的东北三省美术展览会上，一套优秀的历史组画——白手起家，获得画家和观众的很高评价。
    这套历史组画真实地反映了全国著名的英雄工厂、白手起家的辽宁省本溪合金厂的事迹。1950年，这个工厂就是凭着一口大锅、两把勺子、三个模子和四个工人开办起来的，经过克服许多技术上和设备上的困难，生产出许多名贵合金。现在，它已经成为本溪市最大的工业企业之一。这个厂生产的许多独一无二的合金，供应着全国一千多个重要企业，同时还远销朝鲜、越南和东南亚各地。
    白手起家组画一共十四幅，它真实地塑造了三个人物形象。一个是倔强、沉着、对事业充满信心、具有优秀革命品质的共产党员——“老八路”（复员军人），一个是勇于接受新鲜事物、敢想、敢干、肯于钻研的青年工人；另一个是踏踏实实埋头苦干的老工人。组画中“黄不了！”是组画的第一个高潮，也是最精彩的一幅。它表现经过了多次试验高级合金失败后，有个别人被困难吓住，想要不干了。作者非常巧妙地组织画面，在画面的最前边意味深长地放了一口大破锅，但是试验并没有停止，远处烟雾缭绕，火光熊熊，还可以使人感到英雄们仍在继续坚持试验。作品中三个主人翁同时出现在意志薄弱已经打好行李的“逃兵”面前。心地善良的老工人感情是含蓄的，他做出了一个极为惋惜的手势，想在最后的一分钟来说服这个马上就要离开的人。在他身旁的“老八路”，看起来他已经说完了要说的话。他的手叉着腰，用忿怒的眼光狠狠地盯着“逃兵”。青年工人没有放下手上的活，只是抬起头来轻藐地看了一眼。“逃兵”的形象是具有讽刺味道和戏剧动作的，他低垂着头，一手提着行李，虽然画的是背面，但能透露出他的内心。
    “白手起家”组画的作者是沈阳鲁迅美术学院附属中学高中部三、四年级七名十七、八岁的学生。今年年初，他们为了创作优秀的作品向国庆献礼，曾结合创作课到本溪合金厂和工人同吃、同住、同劳动了几个月。看到工人忘我的劳动热情，听到工人讲起英雄的厂史以后，使他们鼓足了干劲。在创作过程中，他们常常向工人征求对作品的意见，请工厂领导同志讨论作品。经过三番五次的修改，才创作出这套优秀的组画。（附图片）
