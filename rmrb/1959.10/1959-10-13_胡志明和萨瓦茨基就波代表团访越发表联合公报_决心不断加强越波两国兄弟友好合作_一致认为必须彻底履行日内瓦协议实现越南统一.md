Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th—It was announced here today: A joint communiqué was issued on October 11th by Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Aleksander Zawadzki, Chairman of the Council of State of the Polish People's Republic, regarding the results of Chairman Zawadzki and the delegation of the Polish People's Republic's visit to Vietnam.

The communiqué states: "During the visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Chairman Zawadzki of the Polish Council of State and members of the delegation held talks with President Ho Chi Minh and members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, as well as members of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The communiqué states: In these talks, both sides reached a complete consensus on all issues discussed.

Both sides welcomed the great victories of the Soviet Union in communist construction, and in the economic and technical fields, especially the increasingly brilliant achievements in conquering outer space.

Both sides noted with satisfaction the trend towards easing international tensions, as evidenced by the visit of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the United States, and expressed their firm determination to fight alongside the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp for the victory of the idea of peaceful coexistence.

Both sides announced their full support for the Soviet proposal on complete and thorough disarmament by all countries, put forward by the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers at the September 18th meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Both sides expressed their conviction that the realization of this extremely important proposal would pave the way for a new era in international relations, permanently eliminate the crisis of war, and contribute to a rapid improvement in the living standards of people in all countries around the world.

The communiqué states: Together with other socialist countries, both countries fully support the Soviet initiative to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys and resolve the issue of the West Berlin regime in order to stabilize the situation in Europe, thereby eliminating the consequences of the Second World War.

Both sides agreed that eliminating the West German militarists' plans to revise borders and arm their forces with atomic weapons is urgently needed to maintain peace in Europe and the world. Both sides reiterated that the Polish western border on the Oder-Neisse line is a border of peace and is inviolable. Both sides fully support the peaceful and progressive efforts of the German people's first worker-peasant state – the German Democratic Republic.

Both sides fully support the People's Republic of China's just right to recover Taiwan and restore its rightful seat in the United Nations. Both sides support the just aspiration of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of their homeland.

Both sides announced that they stand in solidarity with the peoples of Asian and African countries who are fighting against colonialism and imperialism, and for independence and the consolidation of independence.

The communiqué pointed out: "The current grave situation in Laos is due to the Lao government's violation of the Geneva Accords and the conspiracies of imperialist and reactionary groups; both sides agreed that the Geneva Accords must be fully implemented and the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos must be restored. The realization of the Soviet proposal to reconvene a conference of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference will help seek measures to resolve the conflict in Laos.

The South Vietnamese authorities' policy of refusing to implement the Geneva Accords, supported by some Western countries, has created instability in Indochina, which is a serious obstacle to the realization of the Vietnamese people's legitimate desire to reunify their homeland on a peaceful and democratic basis. Despite the serious difficulties the above-mentioned situation has brought to the International Commission for Supervision and Control, both sides believe that the International Commission has made positive contributions to ensuring the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Both sides believe that the Geneva Accords must be correctly implemented, and that general elections must be held in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords to reunify Vietnam."

The communiqué states: "Both sides believe that strengthening the unity and solidarity among socialist countries on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism will contribute in all aspects to the victorious construction of socialism in both countries and will contribute to the consolidation of world peace.

Regarding the relations between the two countries, both sides are pleased to note that the cooperative relations between the two countries are developing and consolidating day by day, and both sides expressed their will to continuously strengthen this relationship on the basis of the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

Both sides believe that the visit of Chairman Aleksander Zawadzki of the Council of State of the Polish People's Republic and the delegation of the Polish People's Republic to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will contribute to the development of cooperation and deep friendship between the Vietnamese and Polish peoples."

　　胡志明和萨瓦茨基就波代表团访越发表联合公报
    决心不断加强越波两国兄弟友好合作
    一致认为必须彻底履行日内瓦协议实现越南统一
    新华社河内12日电　这里今天公布：越南民主共和国主席胡志明和波兰人民共和国国务委员会主席亚历山大·萨瓦茨基10月11日就萨瓦茨基主席和波兰人民共和国代表团在越南访问的结果发表联合公报。
    公报说：“在访问越南民主共和国期间，波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基和代表团团员们同胡志明主席和越南劳动党中央委员会政治局委员们以及越南民主共和国政府成员举行了会谈。”
    公报说：在这些会谈中，双方对谈到的一切问题取得了完全一致的看法。
    双方欢迎苏联在共产主义建设中、在经济和技术方面的伟大胜利，尤其是在征服宇宙空间方面的越来越辉煌的成就。
    双方满意地看到，国际局势趋向缓和，这表现在苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对美国的访问，双方并且表示坚决同苏联和整个社会主义阵营一起为和平共处思想的胜利而斗争。
    双方宣布完全支持苏联部长会议主席在联合国大会9月18日会议上所发表的演说中提出的苏联关于各国全面彻底裁军的建议。双方表示确信这项非常重要的建议的实现将为打开国际关系的新纪元铺平道路，将会永远消除战争危机，为迅速提高全世界各国人民的生活水平作出贡献。
    公报说：两国同其他社会主义国家一起完全支持苏联为消除第二次世界大战的恶果而签订对两个德国的和约和解决西柏林体制问题的倡议，以便稳定欧洲局势。
    双方一致认为，消除西德军国主义关于修正边界和用原子武器武装军队的计划是维护欧洲和世界和平所迫切需要的。双方再一次强调波兰西部奥德—尼斯边界是和平的边界，是不可侵犯的。双方完全支持德国人民的第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国的和平和进步的努力。
    双方完全支持中华人民共和国收复台湾和恢复它在联合国的席位的正当权利。双方支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国要求和平统一祖国的正当愿望。
    双方宣布，他们同正在为反对殖民主义和帝国主义、争取独立和巩固独立而斗争的亚非各国人民团结一致。
    公报指出：“老挝当前的严重局势是由于老挝政府违反日内瓦协议以及帝国主义和反动集团的阴谋制造出来的；双方一致认为必须彻底履行日内瓦协议，必须恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。实现苏联关于重新召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国会议的建议将有助于寻求解决老挝冲突的措施。
    南越当局拒绝履行日内瓦协议的政策得到西方一些国家的支持，使印度支那处于不稳定的状态，这是对实现越南人民要求在和平和民主的基础上统一祖国的正当愿望的严重阻碍。尽管上述情况给国际监察和监督委员会带来严重的困难，但是双方认为国际委员会为保证日内瓦协议的条款的履行作出了积极的贡献。双方认为必须正确地履行日内瓦协议，根据日内瓦协议的规定，举行普选以统一越南。”
    公报说：“双方认为在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上加强社会主义阵营各国间的团结一致，将在各方面有助于两国胜利地建设社会主义，将为巩固世界和平作出贡献。
    关于两国之间的关系，双方高兴地认为两国的合作关系日益发展和巩固，双方表示在无产阶级国际主义精神基础上不断加强这种关系的意志。
    双方认为波兰人民共和国国务委员会主席亚历山大·萨瓦茨基和波兰人民共和国代表团对越南民主共和国的访问将为发展越南人民和波兰人民之间的合作和深厚的友谊关系作出贡献。”
