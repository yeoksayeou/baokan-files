Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: Today, millions of people in the capital entered a magnificent and colorful art palace, filled with drama, movies, music, and dance. Enticing fireworks adorned the night sky with various artistic patterns.

　　Tiananmen Square remained the center of the carnival, with more than one million people continuing to hold festive evening parties here. In the dance circle of the Beijing Timber Factory, the drums boomed, and two golden lions, following the movements of the "embroidered ball," leaped and rolled. The workers of Tongzhou Power Plant celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China yesterday with a "good start" in production. Today, many rushed to participate in the carnival after work. Electrician Wu Runsheng brought his beloved huqin and played "Three Girls Came to the Factory" for his companions, which aroused great interest. After finishing singing in one group, he was invited by applause from another. In front of the Cultural Palace of the Working People, the clatter of bamboo clappers resounded, and Yang Yulong, a sintering worker from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, enthusiastically told everyone a quick-paced story of "Seeing Chairman Mao with Joy on the Holiday." When he said, "Raising our heads, we see Chairman Mao," he pointed to the giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the Tiananmen Gate Tower, excitedly gesticulating.

　　The college students gathered densely in front of the Jinshui Bridge, all beaming. Thirteen Lhoba students from the Tibetan area of the Central Institute for Nationalities, wearing red and green striped short jackets and large hats woven from rattan, danced friendship dances with Tibetan students and social dances with Uygur students. In the dance circle of the Beijing Forestry College, three pairs of young men and women in national costumes danced the "Ariya Dance." The cheerful rhythm and lively dance attracted everyone around them.

　　In many dance circles, soldiers in grass-green uniforms and officers wearing large brimmed hats and armed belts joined everyone in the carnival.

　　The fireworks gala in Beihai Park was the most distinctive scene of tonight's carnival. Heroes, model workers, representatives of ethnic minorities, returned overseas Chinese, people from Hong Kong and Macao, and international friends from the five continents who participated in the National Day observation gathered in the charming gardens to watch the folk fireworks with local characteristics gathered here from all over the country.

　　After clusters of fireworks soared into the sky, innovative fireworks were set off one after another from the seventeen fireworks platforms on the lake. On the fireworks platform near Qiong Island, a moving scene of "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity" appeared. In the rolling thick smoke, a colorful giant dragon more than four zhang long floated out, its mouth spraying sparks, and a colorful phoenix nearly two zhang high soared at the same time. On the water near the west bank, the four large fiery characters "Molten Iron Flows" and two small blast furnaces appeared, with flames raging and molten iron flowing. In the blink of an eye, a pair of male and female "furnace workers" were busy operating. On the fireworks platform in the heart of the lake, a scene of pastoral harvest flashed from a ball of fire, with plump ears of wheat, corn, and sunflowers, and a chubby baby standing on a large cabbage, holding up a banner of "Great Agricultural Harvest." At this time, a wave of lotus lanterns surged on the rippling lake, and groups of goose-shaped, duck-shaped, and fish-shaped lanterns floated with the waves, with a long dragon passing through them. The delighted audience couldn't help but praise the ingenious skills of the firework workers.

　　The fireworks continued to be set off for more than an hour. In the night sky, the "Exquisite Pagoda" appeared suddenly, and then the "Birds Singing and Flowers Fragrant" appeared. A group of colorful starlight flew straight into the sky, and the "chirping" of birds came from the sparks, and a tempting fragrance drifted in with the breeze. These novel fireworks were all gifts from the firework workers to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Just as the "birds" in the "Birds Singing and Flowers Fragrant" fireworks stopped "chirping," a colorful "flower umbrella" composed of fireworks was lit. In front of the railing of the Five Dragon Pavilions on the north bank, the flashing of silver flowers and fiery trees illuminated the happy smiling faces of international friends. Dr. Norgaard, Vice President of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, said happily: "Today's fireworks have illuminated a calm lake with a myriad of colors, it's so beautiful!" He said he felt like he was living in an ocean of peace.

　　Joy filled the whole city. All eighty-odd cinemas, theaters, and clubs in the city were packed from morning to night. The CPPCC Auditorium, the Auditorium of the National Culture Palace, and the auditoriums of many government agencies were also used as film and theater venues to receive audiences. Today, approximately 1.6 million people watched various song and dance performances. Audiences with different interests could choose their favorite programs to enjoy. The famous Peking Opera performing artist Mei Lanfang performed his new play "Mu Guiying Takes Command" in the Huai Rentang.

　　Workers in the eastern suburban industrial area and farmers from nearby people's communes held a grand get-together in the newly built workers' club. The Fujian Provincial Table Tennis Team, which participated in the National Games, also came to help. The Jingxi coal mining area was decorated with red silk and filled with joy. The amateur troupes and film projection teams affiliated to the Mining Bureau performed more than 100 shows in the six major mining areas. Street corners, hillsides, and mine entrances held a variety of cultural and recreational evening parties such as "Little Tianqiao" and "Little Temple Fair," and 80,000 employees and their families enjoyed self-written and self-directed programs. Miners Ma Guochao and Jin Guangyi had just participated in the October "Good Start" production competition yesterday, and today they enthusiastically served as the main actors in the pingju opera "Miner's Home" written by the workers themselves.

　　The people's communes in the suburbs were all festive. At the get-together of the members of the Nanyuan People's Commune, some solved riddles, and some held table tennis, rope skipping, poker, and chess competitions. The Huangtugang People's Commune in the western suburbs was also filled with gongs and drums tonight. Under the colorful arches standing near the production stations, crowds of people, supporting the old and carrying the young, came to participate in the carnival activities. The TV screen showed the scene of fireworks being set off in Tiananmen and Beihai.

    百花齐放赞祖国  万众同声颂十年
    首都节日一片欢腾景象
    据新华社2日讯　今天，首都数百万人民像进入一个绚烂多彩的大艺苑，到处都是戏剧、电影、音乐和舞蹈，诱人的礼花和焰火又把夜空点缀成为各种美术图案。
    天安门广场仍是狂欢的中心，有一百多万人继续在这里举行狂欢晚会。北京市木材厂的舞圈内，鼓声咚咚，两只金黄色的狮子，随着“绣球”的舞动，一会儿跃起，一会儿翻滚。通州发电厂的工人们，昨天以生产“开门红”庆祝了建国十周年。今天一下班很多人就赶来参加狂欢，电气工人武润生带着他喜爱的胡琴，为他的同伴们伴奏“工厂来了三个姑娘”，引起了人们很大的兴趣，在这边的人群里刚演唱完，又被那边的掌声邀请去了。劳动人民文化宫门前竹板“拍拍”连声响，石景山钢铁公司的烧结工人杨玉龙给大家起劲的说“节日喜见毛主席”的快板。当说到“昂首看见毛主席”时，他指着天安门城楼挂着的毛主席巨像，兴奋得手舞足蹈。
    密集在金水桥前的大学生们，一个个眉飞色舞。民族学院十三个西藏地区的珞瑜学生，穿着红绿条短上衣，戴着藤条编的大帽子，一会儿和藏族学生跳友谊舞，一会儿又和维吾尔族的学生跳交谊舞。北京林学院的舞圈里，穿着民族服装的三对男女青年跳起了“亚里亚舞”。欢乐的节拍，明快的舞姿，把四周的人都吸引住了。
    在许多舞圈里，都有穿着草绿色军装的士兵和戴着大沿帽扎着武装带的军官同大家一起狂欢。
    北海公园的焰火盛会，是今晚狂欢最具特色的一幕。参加国庆观礼的英雄模范、少数民族代表、归国华侨、港澳人士和来自五大洲的国际友人，团聚在夜景迷人的园林里，观赏全国各地集中在这里举行的富有地方特色的民间焰火。
    簇簇礼花腾空而起以后，花样新颖的焰火从湖面十七座焰火台上相继燃放起来。靠近琼岛的焰火台上，呈现出“龙凤呈祥”的动人场面。在滚滚的浓烟中一条四丈多长的五彩巨龙浮游而出，它的嘴里喷洒着火花，一只近两丈高的彩凤，同时展翅飞翔。西岸附近的水面上，出现了“铁水奔流”四个大火字和两座小高炉，火花熊熊，铁水奔流。转眼间，又有一对男女“炉前工人”在紧张地操作。在湖心的焰火施放台上，从一团火中闪出一幅田园丰收的景色，丰硕的麦穗、玉米和葵花当中，有个胖娃娃站在大白菜上，高举“农业大丰收”的标语。这时，碧波荡漾的湖面上，又涌现了一片荷灯，成群的鹅形、鸭形、鱼形灯顺波飘游，长长的大龙穿行其间。兴高采烈的观众们，禁不住啧啧称赞花炮工人巧夺天工的技艺。
    焰火连续燃放了一个多小时。夜空中忽而出现“玲珑宝塔”，忽而出现“鸟语花香”，一群五彩光辉的星花直飞上空，从火花中传出小鸟的“唧唧”鸣叫声，随着微风又飘来一股诱人的清香。这些新奇的焰火，都是花炮工人献给建国十周年的礼物。当“鸟语花香”焰火中的“鸟儿”刚刚停止了“唧唧”鸣叫，又燃起了五彩缤纷的火花组成的“花伞”。在北岸五龙亭的栏杆前，站满来自全国各地的五十多种民族的观礼团代表们，他们用不同的语言和最美好的比喻，赞赏焰火，赞颂着中国人民丰富多采的生活。来自西藏山南地区的尼玛泽仁，几个月前还是个受苦的农奴，他看着焰火激动地一边比划，一边对同伴说，过去我当牛马，住黑屋，那里想到还会有今天这样的欢乐！克拉玛依的维吾尔族石油工人乌受尔哈森告诉回族、柯尔克孜族同伴，一股股火花，就像祖国一座座油井的原油永远喷射不完。哈萨克族牧民阿不都拉说，焰火像草原上的牧草花，无比的美丽鲜艳。
    在分凉阁临湖的石雕栏干前面，银花火树的闪光，照亮了国际友人们一张张欢乐的笑脸。世界科学工作者协会副主席诺瑞加德博士高兴地说：“今天的焰火，把一个平静的湖面照得万紫千红，太美了！”他说他好像是生活在和平的海洋中。
    欢乐充满全城。全市八十多个电影院、剧场、俱乐部从早到晚，座无虚席。政协礼堂、民族文化宫礼堂和许多机关的大礼堂，也都作为影剧场地接待观众。今天约有一百六十多万人次看到了各种歌舞影剧。具有不同兴趣的观众，可以各择所好，欣赏自己最喜爱的节目。著名京剧表演艺术家梅兰芳在怀仁堂表演了他的新戏“穆桂英挂帅”。
    东郊工业区的工人和附近人民公社的农民弟兄们，在新盖的工人俱乐部里举行了盛大的联欢晚会。参加全运会的福建省乒乓球代表队也赶来助兴。京西煤矿区披红挂彩，喜气盈门。矿务局所属的业余剧团、电影放映队，在六大矿区演出了一百多场。街头、山坡、矿井口分别举行了“小天桥”、“小庙会”多种多样的文娱晚会，八万名职工和家属欣赏了自编自演的节目。矿工马国超、金广意昨天刚参加过十月开门红的生产竞赛，今天又兴致勃勃地担任了工人们自己编的评剧“矿工之家”的主要演员。
    郊区人民公社全是节日景象。南苑人民公社的社员们在联欢晚会上，有的打灯谜，有的举行乒乓球、跳绳、扑克、象棋比赛。西郊黄土岗人民公社今晚也是锣鼓喧天。矗立在各生产站附近的彩色牌楼下过往着扶老携幼前来参加狂欢活动的人群。电视机上映现出天安门、北海燃放礼花、焰火的情景。
