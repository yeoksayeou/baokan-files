Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th -- TASS reported: The Soviet "Pravda" published an article on the 12th, commenting on the results of the Central Treaty Organization Council's Washington Conference which closed on October 9th.

The article wrote that the convening of this conference and the communique it adopted can only be seen as an attempt to obstruct the elimination of the "Cold War" and the easing of the international atmosphere.

The article emphasized that the choice of the location and time for holding this conference is noteworthy. As the "New York Herald Tribune" admitted in an editorial: "It is strange that the council of this organization is holding a meeting in the capital of a non-member country." The newspaper immediately explained, "Since the establishment of the Baghdad Pact, the United States has been a member of this group, if not nominally, then in spirit."

The article continued, in recent years, the United States has not only been the "spiritual member" of this aggressive bloc, but also its leading force.

The article asked, how can the United States, which has such close ties with the Central Treaty Organization (the United States has bilateral military agreements with the member states of this group), not hope to formally declare itself as its member? The article then answered: As the "Washington Post and Times Herald" said, the reason is: "Arab countries criticize the Central Treaty Organization too harshly, and neutral countries have too cold an attitude toward this group."

　　苏联“真理报”评中央条约组织华盛顿会议
    美国之意在于阻挠“冷战”的消除
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”12日发表一篇文章，评论10月9日闭幕的中央条约组织理事会华盛顿会议的结果。
    文章写道，这次会议的召开和它所通过的公报不是别的，而只能被看作是想阻挠“冷战”的消除和国际气氛的缓和的一种企图。
    文章强调指出，举行这次会议的地点和时间的选择，就是值得注意的。正如“纽约先驱论坛报”在社论中所承认的一样：“奇怪的是，这个组织的理事会竟在一个非成员国的首都举行会议。”这家报纸立即又解释说，“自巴格达集团建立以来，美国如果不是在名义上、那就是在精神上是这个集团的成员国。”
    文章接着写道，近年来，美国不仅一直是这个侵略集团的“精神上的成员”，而且也是它的领导力量。
    文章问道，一个与中央条约组织有如此密切联系的美国（美国同这个集团的成员国订有双边军事协定），怎能不希望在形式上宣布作为它的成员呢？文章接着回答说：就像“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”所说的那样，原因在于：“阿拉伯国家对中央条约组织的抨击太厉害，中立国家对这个集团的态度太冷淡”。
