Some people think that Beijing people love to listen to opera, especially Peking Opera, and especially prefer Peking Opera from Beijing. I don't think that's entirely true. On National Day, I wrote a short article in the Beijing Daily, mentioning that Beijing audiences have loved opera for hundreds of years, from the Yuan Dynasty to the present. All forms of opera have received high praise here. Beijing audiences treat all good operas that are pleasing to the ear equally and welcome them all. Of course, Peking Opera is a comprehensive art form that has grown and developed in Beijing by integrating various local operas. Therefore, audiences love and care about Peking Opera more and have stricter requirements for it, which is understandable. When Peking Opera troupes from other places come to the capital, it's like a married daughter returning to her parents' home. There's a special kind of intimacy between the audience and the actors. The warm welcome given to the Yunnan Peking Opera Troupe's performance in Beijing is a good example of this.

The Yunnan Peking Opera Troupe is said to be composed of top performers selected from several troupes, proficient in both civil and military roles, Kunqu Opera, and various schools of Peking Opera. Most of the actors in the troupe had close cooperation with revolutionary literary and art workers during the difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This troupe has developed in the midst of sharp struggles. During the festival of universal celebration, old and new friends gathered together to talk happily, so it is no wonder that everyone was beaming with joy and was exceptionally happy.

At a reception for literary and art circles, they performed five wonderful programs. Because I attended another banquet beforehand, the performance was already halfway through when I arrived. A comrade next to me told me that Jin Suqiu's "Drunken Concubine" had good waist and leg skills and a beautiful appearance. "Drunken Wei" is a section from the play "Fighting Wan City." Qiu Shirong, who plays Dian Wei, has stage presence and bearing that are no less than those of his elder brother, Qiu Shengrong, showing that he comes from a family of scholars. Guan Suhuang's "Stealing the Immortal Herb" is based on Tian Han's "Legend of the White Snake." Her Gaobozi singing is loud and clear, and her movements are quick and efficient. After hearing these words, I regretted arriving late. Now I will talk about "Bo Ya Breaks the Qin" and "Water Flooding the Seven Armies," which I saw.

"Bo Ya Breaks the Qin," also known as "Ma'anshan," is a traditional play. Xu Minchu plays Yu Boya. He is an actor of the Yan School of Lao Sheng (old male role). He can inherit the artistic characteristics of Mr. Ju Peng. In terms of pronunciation, enunciation, melody, and breathing, he works on the big picture, without focusing on the subtle and delicate aspects of a single tune. The Sanban (a type of rhythm in Peking Opera) is even more wonderful. Mr. Chen Yanheng, an expert in the study of Tan (Xinpei)'s style, once said: "Slow tempo is more difficult than fast tempo, fast tempo is more difficult than steady tempo, and Sanban is more difficult than accurate tempo." Xu Minchu's Sanban can be called accurate and not "scattered." In addition, it can be seen that this script was revised by Ju Peng in his time. Whether in terms of words or rhythm, it can portray the profound emotions of Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi, high mountains and flowing water, and the difficulty of finding a soulmate again.

Guan Opera is an excellent tradition of the Hui Opera troupes, emphasizing stage presence and divine power. Mi Xizi, Cheng Changgeng, and other predecessors showed their skills here, and opera colleagues still talk about it with great interest. That evening, Liu Kuiguan's performance of "Water Flooding the Seven Armies" was also in the style of the Hui Opera, with accurate hand, eye, body, and footwork. The creation of this type of Guan Opera is closely related to temple sculptures and paintings. Liu Kuiguan's pose gave people a sculptural feeling. He and I were both born in the Jiawu year (1894), in the same month. Today, we can gather in the capital and still be young enough to perform on stage, which is truly fortunate. I would like to borrow a sentence from Ni Rong to Xiao En in "Fisherman's Revenge": "Old hero," to give to him. I remember seeing him perform the Qingmianhu (Blue-faced Tiger) in "Tongtianxi" (Rhinoceros Reaching the Sky). The kind of agile and leaping skills are still vivid in my mind. It is said that his "Tongtianxi" was learned from the famous Wuerhua (martial arts actor) Mr. Fan Baoting, which is not only solid and flexible, but also accurate and beautiful. It can be seen that an actor must have a deep foundation and a good teacher. Based on this foundation, creation and development can flourish and advance with the times.

The young actors in the Yunnan Peking Opera Troupe all have good skills, which is inseparable from the artistic guidance of the old masters. But I hope that the young comrades in the troupe will exchange some experience with the Peking Opera circle in this short period, which will be more helpful for improvement.

    归宁的京剧之花
    梅兰芳
    有人认为北京人听戏，爱听京戏，尤其偏爱北京的京戏，我看是不尽然的。国庆日，我在北京日报上写过一篇短文，曾谈到北京观众爱好戏曲，从元朝到现在几百年中，各种形式的戏曲，都在这里得到很高的评价，凡是赏心悦耳的好戏，北京观众是一视同仁，无不欢迎的。当然，京戏是综合各种地方戏，在北京成长发展起来的，因此观众对京戏更热爱些，更关心些，而要求也更严格些，那也是有的。外地的京剧团到首都来，就好像出嫁的姑娘回娘家一样，观众与演员之间，别有一种亲切的滋味。云南省京剧演出团旅京演出，所以受到观众的欢迎，就是一个很好的例子。
    云南省京剧演出团，据说是几个剧团里选拔出来的尖子，文武昆乱俱备，还包括各种流派，其中大部分演员在抗战的艰苦岁月里，曾经和革命的文艺工作者密切合作过，这个团是在尖锐斗争中发展起来的。当普天同庆的节日里，旧雨新知，衔杯畅叙，无怪乎大家都喜上眉梢，分外高兴。
    在一次招待文艺界的晚会中，他们演出了五个精采节目，我因为先参加另一个宴会，入场时，戏已演过一半，隔座的同志告诉我，前面金素秋演的“醉酒”，腰腿功夫好，扮相美。“醉韦”是战宛城中的一节，裘世戎去典韦，工架、气度都不逊于乃兄裘盛戎，可见家学渊源。关鹔鹴的“盗仙草”，是照田汉同志写的“白蛇传”演的，高拨子唱得响亮痛快，出手眼明手快，干净利落。我听了这些话，后悔来迟一步。我现在谈谈看到的“伯牙碎琴”“水淹七军”。
    “伯牙碎琴”又名“马鞍山”，是传统剧目。徐敏初饰俞伯牙，他是言派老生，能够继承菊朋先生的艺术特点，在出字、收音、行腔、换气方面都从大处落墨，不沾沾于一腔一调的侧媚纤巧；散板更妙。谭学专家陈彦衡先生曾经有几句名言：“慢板难于紧，快板难于稳，散板难于准。”徐敏初的散板称得起准而不“散”。另外，可以看出这个剧本是当年菊朋整理过的，无论在文字上、音节上都能刻划出俞伯牙与钟子期的高山流水、知音难再的深厚感情。
    关戏是徽班的优秀传统，讲究工架、神威。当年米喜子、程长庚诸前辈都在这里显过身手，至今戏曲同行还津津乐道。这晚刘奎官演的“水淹七军”，也宗的是徽派，手、眼、身法、步都有准地方，这类关戏的创造，是和庙宇塑像、绘画有密切关系的，刘奎官的亮相就使人有雕塑感。他和我都是甲午年生人，同年同月，今天能够在首都聚首一堂，并且彼此都还不老，都还能登台演戏，真是幸福，我想借用“打渔杀家”中倪荣对萧恩的一句话：“老英雄”送给他。我记得当年看他演“通天犀”的青面虎，那种矫健腾跃的功夫，现在还历历如在目前。听说他的“通天犀”是向著名武二花范宝亭先生学习的，不但扎实灵活，并且准确美观，可见一个演员，既要有深厚的功底，还要有很好的师承，在这种基础上创造发展，才能蒸蒸日上，与年俱进。
    云南京剧演出团里青年演员的功夫都不错，这和老先生们的艺术指导是分不开的。但我希望团内的青年同志们，在这短短的时间内与北京戏曲界交流一些经验，这样会更有助于提高。
