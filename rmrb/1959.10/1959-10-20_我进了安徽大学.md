　　I Entered Anhui University
　　Peasant Singer from Feidong County, Anhui Province: Yin Guanglan
　　Do you all remember the peasant singer Yin Guanglan from Anhui? Last year, she came to Beijing for the National Conference of Folk Literature Workers. This peasant singer, who had been a child bride for twenty years, gave a wonderful performance at the conference, attracting great attention. An abstract of her speech was published on page 7 of this newspaper on July 14th of last year, entitled "Singing Encourages Everyone to Strive Upward." Below is a new song she recently composed.　——Editor

　　Beating the drum and striking the gong,
　　Singing a newly composed song.
　　It's easy for others to write songs,
　　But it's difficult for me to compose new ones.
　　Many characters I can't write,
　　Wrong characters, incorrect words fill a basket;
　　I can think well, but can't write well,
　　Anxiously scratching my cheeks, stamping my feet, and scratching my ears;
　　Often I ask others about a word,
　　Walking back and forth, the soles of my shoes are worn out.
　　I hate the evil old society,
　　The life of a child bride was tormented;
　　The carrying pole, like a big "one" character,
　　I looked at it, and it looked at me.
　　The rich went to school, I herded cattle,
　　I never touched the school gate.
　　I remember,
　　One year, I was only eight or nine years old,
　　Herding cattle, I passed by the school;
　　Leaning against the wooden door, I looked inside,
　　Young masters filled the room,
　　I was watching so intently,
　　Suddenly I was whipped.
　　Looking back,
　　The running dog of the landlord Liu,
　　Holding a leather whip, glaring with dog eyes,
　　A group of young masters stood behind,
　　One holding a stick, another waving a fist:
　　Roll away, roll away quickly,
　　How dare a wild child peep into the "Hall of Civilization."
　　I was so scared,
　　I turned around and ran home,
　　A pack of vicious dogs chased after me.
　　The more I thought about it, the more upset I became,
　　Large tears dripped down.
　　Like a thunderclap, the clouds and mist dissipated,
　　A round of red sun shines overhead.
　　The poor turned over, and the land changed,
　　Holding the stairs, step by step higher,
　　The Party Secretary smiled at me,
　　A letter shaking in his hand:
    "The Party knows your heart,
　　Your desire to learn culture is high,
　　We'll send you to Anhui University,
　　Where you can learn all kinds of knowledge,
　　We wish you,
　　To study hard and delve deeply,
　　And return to work and make new contributions."
　　That made me feel,
　　My whole body was filled with strength like a spring,
　　That made me feel,
　　A thousand words choked in my throat.
　　A hundred sentences are not as good as one good one,
　　I will always remember the Party's words.
　　When people encounter happy events, they gain strength,
　　Even plain water tastes sweet.
　　On the first day of school,
　　I was so happy that I couldn't sleep,
　　A round of bright moon hangs in front of the curtain,
　　So many things flashed before my eyes:
　　In the old society,
　　Who treated me like a human being?
　　In the old society,
　　Who elected me as a representative?
　　In the old society,
　　How could I have gone to Beijing?
　　In the old society,
　　How could I have met Chairman Mao?
　　In the old society,
　　Where could I have studied?
　　Old society, oh old society,
　　Every single thing fills my heart with hatred,
　　Comparing the past with today,
　　Everything is sweeter than honey,
　　Communist Party, oh Chairman Mao,
　　Your kindness is as heavy as a mountain.
　　The rooster crows in the middle of the night, and my heart is restless,
　　I jump out of bed to write a guarantee,
　　First, I write to thank the Party for its cultivation,
　　Second, I write to express my determination to study,
　　Study diligently, practice hard, and delve deeply,
　　I will definitely be a good student, both red and expert,
　　Third, I write that after graduating from school,
　　I will serve the people wholeheartedly.
　　I will make achievements to repay the Party,
　　And send the good news to Chairman Mao.

### 我进了安徽大学

　　我进了安徽大学
　　安徽肥东县农民歌手　殷光兰
    大家还记得安徽农民歌手殷光兰吗？去年开全国民间文学工作者大会的时候，她来到了北京。这个曾当了二十年童养媳的农民歌手在会上作了精彩的表演，引起人们很大的注意。她的发言曾摘要发表在去年7月14日本报第七版，题目是“唱得人人争上游”。下面发表的是她最近编唱的一首新歌。　——编者
　　打起鼓来敲起锣，
　　唱了一段新编歌。
　　旁人编歌很容易，
　　我编新歌困难多。
　　多少字儿不会写，
　　错字别字一大箩；
　　想的好来写不好，
　　急的抓腮跺脚搔耳朵；
　　常为一字去问人，
　　来回鞋底都磨破。
　　恨只恨万恶旧社会，
　　童养媳生活受折磨；
　　扁担长的大“一”字，
　　我望它来它望我。
　　富人上学我放牛，
　　学堂门边没摸过。
　　曾记得，
　　有年我才八九岁，
　　放牛走过学堂前；
　　靠着木门朝里望，
　　公子少爷满屋园，
　　正在看的出了神，
　　身上突然挨一鞭。
　　回头望，
　　刘大地主狗腿子，
　　手拿皮鞭瞪狗眼，
　　一群少爷后面站，
　　你拿棍子他挥拳：
　　滚滚滚来快快滚，
　　野孩子敢偷“文明院”。
　　吓得我，
　　拔脚回头朝家跑，
　　一群恶狗后边撵。
　　越思越想心难受，
　　豆大泪珠点连点。
　　霹雳一声云雾消，
　　一轮红日当头照。
　　穷人翻身地变样，
　　手扶楼梯步步高，
　　支书对我笑呵呵，
　　一封信啊手中摇：
    “你的心事党知道，
　　学习文化要求高，
　　把你送到安大去，
　　各样知识都学到，
　　预祝你，
　　苦学苦钻求深造，
　　回来工作再立功劳。”
　　说得我，
　　浑身力量如泉涌，
　　说得我，
　　千言万语堵喉梢。
　　百句不如一句好，
　　党的话儿永记牢。
　　人逢喜事劲儿添，
　　白水沾口口也甜。
　　上学堂啊头一天，
　　喜的上床难入眠，
　　一轮明月帘前挂，
　　多少事儿映眼前：
　　旧社会，
　　哪个把我当人待？
　　旧社会，
　　哪个把我代表选？
　　旧社会，
　　哪里有我北京上？
　　旧社会，
　　我怎能把主席见？
　　旧社会，
　　哪里有我把书念。
　　旧社会呀旧社会，
　　件件事儿恨心间，
　　看看过去比今天，
　　样样事儿比蜜甜，
　　共产党啊毛主席，
　　您的恩情重如山。
　　夜半鸡叫心难静，
　　跳下床沿写保证，
　　一写感谢党培养，
　　二写学习下决心，
　　勤学苦练多钻研，
　　定做红专好学生，
　　三写毕业出校后，
　　全心全意为人民。
　　做出成绩报答党，
　　喜讯寄给毛主席。
