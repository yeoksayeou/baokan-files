Xinhua News Agency, October 25th dispatch: According to a TASS report, Academician Topchiev of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Association for the United Nations, at a gathering in Moscow on the 24th to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, exposed the aggressive groups of certain countries for using the United Nations to achieve their narrow goals. He said that the provocative clamor surrounding the so-called "Tibet issue" is an example of this.

Topchiev said that the goals declared by the United Nations at its founding have not been achieved. There are still serious shortcomings in the work of the United Nations, which prevent it from becoming a truly universal institution and an effective tool for peace and international security. Topchiev pointed out that the great Chinese people have been unable to obtain their legitimate seat in the United Nations for ten years.

In his speech, Topchiev also emphasized the great significance of Khrushchev's visit to the United States in easing international tensions. He also pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is entirely in line with the wishes of the people of all countries. The United Nations should adopt a plan for complete and thorough disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th dispatch: The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 24th, condemning the United Nations General Assembly for discussing the so-called "Tibet issue." The commentary believes that this session of the United Nations General Assembly shows that the Western Cold War supporters still adhere to their policy of strength, are uneasy about the new atmosphere, and do not want to face the demands of millions of peace-loving people. The commentary said that the facts show that the imperialist bloc has been wantonly undermining the United Nations Charter in the past and present, and this behavior has weakened the prestige of this important international organization.

Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd dispatch: New Delhi News: Some Indian newspapers oppose the United States and other Western countries for initiating a discussion on the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations, believing that this only serves the interests of the United States in inciting the Cold War and intensifying international tensions. However, other newspapers took the opportunity to incite anti-China sentiment and published slanderous remarks against China and interfered in China's internal affairs.

"Crossroads" reported on the 15th that the United Nations General Assembly's debate on the Tibet issue "will further increase resentment in Asia and intensify the atmosphere of the Cold War."

The newspaper revealed that the results of this vote showed that "it was purely due to the initiation of the United States and Britain that it was possible to propose the Tibet issue for discussion." "Apart from Pakistan, most of the Asian and African countries abstained in this vote; this means that this issue should not have been raised in the first place." The newspaper believes that India is "overly enthusiastic about the Tibet issue." It said that India has an obligation to oppose this proposal, "We cannot understand why India actually did not oppose this proposal."

"Unity Daily" said on the 16th that those anti-China propagandists in India who demanded support for the Tibet issue in the United Nations were "selling out their country under foreign orders and engaging in the most foolish actions."

The newspaper accused the leaders of the Indian People's League and the People's Socialist Party of "speaking in the language of the Americans and the British; this language will drag India into a devastating war." It said that this war would only benefit the United States and would not benefit us at all.

"New Century" weekly published an article written by Joshi, Secretary of the National Committee Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, accusing the People's Socialist Party of passing a resolution requiring the Indian representative to support the discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations.

    各国公众舆论继续谴责联大非法决议
    任何国家无权干涉中国内政
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学院院士、苏联联合国协会理事会主席托普切夫24日在莫斯科纪念联合国成立十四周年的集会上，揭露某些国家的侵略集团利用联合国来达到自己的狭隘目的。他说，围绕所谓“西藏问题”的挑衅性叫嚣就是这方面的例证。
    托普切夫说，联合国在成立时所宣布的目标并没有达到。联合国的工作至今还存在严重的缺点，这些缺点妨碍它成为一个真正普遍的机构、成为和平和国际安全的有效工具。托普切夫指出，伟大的中国人民不能在联合国中取得自己合法的席位已经有十年了。
    托普切夫在发言中还强调了赫鲁晓夫访问美国对缓和国际紧张局势所具有的重大意义。他还指出，苏联关于全面彻底裁军的建议完全符合各国人民的愿望。联合国应当通过全面彻底裁军的计划。
    据新华社25日讯　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”24日发表评论，谴责联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”。评论认为，这一届联合国大会表明西方的冷战支持者还坚持他们的实力政策，不安于新的气氛，不想正视千百万和平人民的要求。评论说，事实表明，过去和现在，帝国主义集团都在放肆地破坏联合国宪章，这种行为减弱了这一重要国际组织的威信。
    据新华社23日讯　新德里消息：印度有些报纸反对美国等西方国家发起在联和国讨论所谓“西藏问题”，认为这只符合美国煽动冷战、加剧国际紧张局势的利益。但是另外也有些报纸趁机煽动反华，发表诬蔑中国和干涉中国内政的言论。
    “划时代报”15日认为联和国大会辩论西藏问题“会在亚洲进一步增加恶感和加剧冷战的气氛。”
    这家报纸揭露说，这次投票的结果表明，“纯粹是由于美英的发起才使得有可能提出西藏问题来讨论”。“除了巴基斯坦以外，亚非国家大多数在这次表决中弃权；这意味着这个问题本来是不应当提出的。”这家报纸认为印度“对西藏问题过分热心”。它说，印度有义务来反对这项提案，“我们不能理解为什么印度竟然在实际上没有反对这项提案”。
    “团结报”16日说，那些要求在联合国中支持西藏问题的印度反华宣传分子，都是“奉了外国的命令出卖自己的国家，从事最愚蠢不过的行动”。
    这家报纸指责印度人民同盟分子和人民社会党的领袖们“用美国人和英国人的语言讲话；这种语言会把印度拖入毁灭性的战争”。它说，这种战争只有利于美国，对我们则毫无好处。
    “新世纪”周报刊登了印度共产党全国委员会书记处书记乔希写的一篇文章，指责人民社会党通过的要求印度代表在联合国支持讨论所谓“西藏问题”的决议。
