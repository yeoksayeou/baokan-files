　　Heroes Aspire to Seize High Yields, Everyone Strives to Be a Pioneer
　　Yang Wanlin Work Team, Studious and Tireless for Over Seven Years, Exceeds Production Every Month
　　Changshou Youth Group Cooperates Ingeniously, Completing Five-Year Task in Eight Months
　　Yang Zheming Gathers Collective Wisdom, Accomplishing Fifty-Eight Months of Work in Eight Months
    This newspaper reports: The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering’s Yang Wanlin Mixed Work Team, since its establishment in June 1952, has exceeded its production target every month for eighty-eight consecutive months. The completed projects have all been inspected and found to be of excellent quality, with safe production achieved.

    Over the past seven years, the Yang Wanlin Mixed Work Team has continuously maintained the glorious title of advanced collective for twenty-eight times. At the recent National Construction and Installation Experience Exchange Conference, it was also named a model mixed work team in the national construction industry. Facing victory and honor, Yang Wanlin and his work team remained humble and avoided complacency, always maintaining high spirits and advancing from victory to victory with a spirit of continuous revolution.

    The Yang Wanlin team pays close attention to learning from the advanced experiences of other teams and groups, and mobilizes the entire team to engage in creative inventions. Last year alone, the team's employees created and improved 116 new machines and tools, increasing work efficiency by one to seven times.

    Yang Wanlin and the work team he leads have a slogan: Go wherever there is experience to learn; go wherever support is needed. In order to learn from the experiences of brother teams and groups, they beat gongs and drums to go to other construction sites to ask for advice and learn from others. Therefore, this bricklaying team of four years ago has become a multi-skilled work team mastering eighteen technologies such as bricklaying, carpentry, steel reinforcement, electric welding, forging, and concrete. The Yang Wanlin team also wholeheartedly helps others with the difficulties of brother teams and groups as if they were their own.

    Since the third quarter of this year, the Yang Wanlin team has been engaged in "hook-up competitions" with thirteen teams and groups. This is a labor competition full of the spirit of communist cooperation. As soon as the Yang Wanlin team has any creations today, this experience will be promoted in the opponent's team or group tomorrow; if the competitor has any difficulties, the Yang Wanlin team will immediately provide support. The Yang Wanlin team has also specially organized an experience dissemination group, drawing excellent veteran technicians to take new machines and tools and new experiences to brother teams and groups, while laboring in production and disseminating and promoting them. Brother teams also frequently come to the Yang Wanlin team to exchange experiences and help the Yang Wanlin team to continuously improve. With the help of the Yang Wanlin team, some teams and groups that often failed to complete their tasks have now exceeded their tasks. The Yang Wanlin team not only exceeds its own tasks every month, but also has no backward teams around them. (Guo Fenxiang)

    This newspaper reports: The Changshou Youth Group of the Second Workshop of the Harbin Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory, striding ahead of time, completed the workload of five years, three months, and five days in eight months, becoming the champion of advanced groups in Harbin this year.

    The tasks undertaken by this group are mostly key products supporting various steel bases or rural areas, such as brick presses, blast furnace equipment, and irrigation and drainage machinery. The group has old machine tools (five belt-driven machine tools, two pieces of rudimentary equipment), and few personnel (17 out of 27 are apprentices), facing numerous difficulties. In this situation, they focused on major technical innovations and technical revolutions for the key to production.

    "Cooperating Ingeniously" is the biggest feature of this group. Everyone engaged in innovation, and everything engaged in innovation has become the ethos of the group. Whenever there are difficult problems in production, the group convenes "brainstorming meetings" to tap everyone's wisdom; when solutions are found, they are assigned to specific people to quickly resolve them. Therefore, the number of technical innovation projects is large, the implementation is fast, and the effects are great. In the past eight months, the group has put forward two thousand rationalization proposals, implemented one thousand two hundred, and realized a total of two hundred and twenty innovations in technology, tools, fixtures, and die models, almost one per day, including thirteen major innovations, which increased production efficiency by one to twenty-five times respectively. For example, when processing the body of a 20-horsepower diesel engine, it was required to produce 25 units per day, exceeding the equipment capacity by four times. The manpower was even more insufficient. At the suggestion of comrades Li Guangyao and Li Huarui, the masters of the group jointly studied, divided the work, and worked hard for seven days and nights, finally making a double-rod boring machine, changing the four processes of machining the cylinder hole into one process, increasing the efficiency by 25 times. In this group, not only the masters achieved improvements, but even the apprentices dared to think and dare to do, and innovate at all times.

    This newspaper, Urumqi, 12th: The Yang Zheming Group of the Foundry Workshop of the Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Factory completed the output value task of four years and ten months in eight months, and won the glorious title of advanced collective.

    The characteristic of the Yang Zheming Group is that ideological work is tightly grasped, and the mass line is followed in everything. Therefore, the workers' enthusiasm is sustained, and the wisdom of the masses is fully utilized. In January this year, the foundry workshop accepted the task of casting hot air pipes. Each group felt that it was tricky to solve the problem of replacing cast iron with local iron. The Yang Zheming Group took the initiative to accept this task. At the beginning of casting, the scrap rate was over 90% due to the high sulfur content of the local iron. The workers conducted dozens of experiments, held dozens of group meetings, and summed up experience from failures, finally breaking through this key. Because of the breakthrough in the quality control of local iron casting, the morale of the whole group rose. Yang Zheming immediately seized the opportunity to organize everyone to vigorously increase production. At the beginning of March, the whole group launched a high-yield, high-quality red flag competition. At the same time, according to the situation of each type of work, the labor organization was adjusted, and assembly line operations were implemented. The production of the whole group was closely linked, and the actions were coordinated and consistent, ensuring that production could be carried out at a high speed and in an orderly manner. During the production process, everyone was mobilized to continuously create high-yield records. Through this method, potential was explored, confidence was encouraged, and higher targets were proposed step by step. As a result, the daily output increased from more than a dozen to more than fifty, more than eighty, and a maximum of more than one hundred per day. Therefore, in only four months, the annual output value plan was overfulfilled by more than one time.

    In August, the group accepted the task of casting more than 40 kinds of castings for 30 sets of Roots blowers. According to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the group repeatedly explained the great significance of production, encouraged everyone's confidence with past achievements, and then mobilized everyone to discuss difficulties, talk about understanding, put forward measures, and tap potential, and fully launched the competition. And according to the current high sulfur and phosphorus content of gray iron, the casting method was changed, changing the original four risers to two square risers, and extending the cooling time of the castings, overcoming the phenomenon of shrinkage cracks and shrinkage cavities in the castings, so that the scrap rate quickly dropped from 70% to 5% and 6%, and the output rose linearly. A total of 60 sets of Roots blower castings were completed in the whole month, which was doubled compared with the original plan.

    Now, the Yang Zheming Group is further summarizing the experience of high yield and high quality, and striving to create greater achievements in the future. (Guo Ting)

　　英雄立志夺高产  个个争当急先锋
　　杨万林工作队好学不倦七年多来月月超产
　　长寿青年组齐心使巧劲五年任务八个月完
　　杨哲明集众智八个月干了五十八个月的活
    本报讯　建筑工程部第三工程局杨万林混合工作队，从1952年6月建队以来，连续八十八个月，月月超额完成生产任务。已经完成的工程，经过检查，工程质量全部良好，并且做到了安全生产。
    七年多来，杨万林混合工作队连续保持了二十八次先进集体的光荣称号，在不久前召开的全国建筑安装经验交流会上，又被评选为全国建筑业混合工作队的标兵。队长杨万林，连续二十七次被选为全国、省和本单位的先进生产者，受到四十多次奖励。在胜利和荣誉面前，杨万林和他的工作队戒骄戒躁，始终干劲饱满，以不断革命精神，从胜利走向胜利。
    杨万林队很注意学习别的队、组的先进经验，并发动全队大搞创造发明。仅去年全队职工创造和改进的新机具就有一百一十六件，使工效提高一倍到七倍。
    杨万林和他领导的工作队有个口号：哪里有经验，就到哪里学；哪里需要支援，就到哪里去。他们为了学习兄弟队、组的经验，敲锣打鼓到别的工地向人请教，拜人为师。因此他们这个四年前的瓦工专业队，今天已成为掌握瓦、木、钢筋、电焊、锻、混凝土等十八种技术的多能工作队了。对于兄弟队组的困难，杨万林队也是像对待自己的困难一样全力帮助别人。
    今年第三季度以来，杨万林队已经和十三个队、组进行了“挂钩赛”。这是一种充满共产主义协作精神的劳动竞赛，只要今天杨万林队有什么创造，明天这项经验就在竞赛对手的队、组里推广开了；竞赛对方一有困难，杨万林队立刻支援。杨万林队还专门组织了一个经验传播组，抽出优秀的老技工，带着新机具、新经验到兄弟队、组去，一边劳动生产，一边传播推广。各兄弟队也经常到杨万林队交流经验，帮助杨万林队不断提高。在杨万林队的帮助下，一些原来经常完不成任务的队、组，现在都超额完成任务。杨万林队不仅自己月月超额完成任务，他们的四周也已没有落后队了。　　（郭汾祥）
    本报讯　昂首阔步跑在时间前面的哈尔滨祥泰内燃机厂二车间长寿青年小组，八个月就完成了五年三个月零五天的工作量，成为今年全哈尔滨市先进小组的冠军。
    这个小组担负的任务多是压砖机、高炉设备、排灌机械等支援各钢铁基地或农村的重点产品，小组内机床旧（五台皮带机床，二台土设备），人手少（二十七人中十七人是徒工），困难重重。在这种情况下，他们就针对生产关键大闹技术革新和技术革命。
    “齐心使巧力”是这个小组最大的特点。人人闹革新，事事闹革新，已经成了小组的风气。生产上一遇到困难问题，小组内就召开“多谋会”，发挥大家的智慧；想出办法，就分工包干迅速解决。因而技术革新的项目数量多、实现快、效果大。八个月来，全组提出合理化建议二千件，实现一千二百件，工艺、刀具、卡具、胎模等方面的革新共实现二百二十项，几乎是每天一项，其中重大革新有十三项，使生产效率分别提高一至二十五倍。如在加工二十马力柴油机机体时，要求每天生产二十五台，超过设备能力四倍。人力更是不足，在李光耀、李华瑞等同志的提议下，全组师傅共同研究，分工突击，苦战七昼夜，终于制成一台双杆镗床，把加工汽缸孔的四道工序改为一道工序，提高效率二十五倍。这个小组里，不仅师傅做到了人人有改进，就连徒工也敢想敢干，时时有革新。
    本报乌鲁木齐12日电　乌鲁木齐农业机械厂铸造车间杨哲明小组八个月完成了四年零十个月的产值任务，获得先进集体的光荣称号。
    杨哲明小组的特点是，思想工作抓得紧，事事走群众路线，因而工人干劲持久，群众智慧得到了充分发挥。今年1月间，铸造车间接受了铸造热风管的任务。在解决用土铁代替铸铁的问题上，各个小组感到棘手，杨哲明小组主动地接受了这个任务。浇铸开始时，由于土铁含硫太高，废品率达90％以上。工人们作了十几次试验，开了十几次小组会，从失败中总结了经验，终于突破了这一关键。由于突破了土铁铸造质量关，全组情绪高涨起来。杨哲明立即抓住时机，组织大家猛力提高产量。3月初，全组展开了高产优质红旗竞赛，同时，根据各工种情况，调整了劳动组织，实行流水作业，全组生产环环紧紧相扣，动作协调一致，保证了生产能够高速度地、有秩序地进行。在生产过程中发动大家不断创造高产纪录，通过这种方法摸潜力，鼓信心，并一步步提出更高的指标，结果日产量由十多根提高到五十多根、八十多根，最高达日产一百多根，因而，仅仅用了四个月的时间就超额一倍多完成了全年的产值计划。
    8月份小组接受了浇铸三十台罗茨鼓风机的四十多种铸件任务。小组里根据八中全会决议精神，反复说明生产的重大意义，用过去的成绩鼓舞大家的信心后，又动员大家摆困难，谈认识，提措施，挖潜力，全面展开竞赛。并根据今用的灰口铁含硫、含磷量高的情况，因而改变了浇铸方法，将原来的四个冒口改为两个方冒口，延长铸件冷却时间，克服了铸件缩裂、缩孔的现象，使废品率迅速由70％降低到5％、6％，产量直线上升。全月共完成了六十台罗茨鼓风机的铸件，比原计划增加一倍。
    现在，杨哲明小组正进一步总结高产优质的经验，争取在今后创造出更大的成绩。　　　（郭挺）
