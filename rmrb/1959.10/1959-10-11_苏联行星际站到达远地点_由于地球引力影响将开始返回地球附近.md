Xinhua News Agency, October 10th, Moscow Dispatch: TASS, Moscow - At 20:00 Moscow time on October 9th, the Soviet automatic interplanetary station continued its operation, located in the constellation Ophiuchus, with a right ascension of 16 hours 40 minutes and a declination of minus 2 degrees 36 minutes. At this time, the coordinates of the automatic interplanetary station above the Earth's surface were 3 degrees south latitude and 22 degrees west longitude. Its distance from the Earth's surface was 466,000 kilometers.

The automatic interplanetary station will reach the apogee of its orbit on October 10th and will begin to move closer to the Earth. On October 18th at 20:00, it will be approximately 40,000 kilometers from the Earth's surface, with a speed of 4 kilometers per second.

The automatic interplanetary station completes one orbit around the Earth approximately every fifteen days and nights, traveling more than one million kilometers in one orbit.

Data received on October 8th confirms that the interplanetary station's scientific instruments, equipment, and automatic devices continue to operate normally.

The next transmission of data from the automatic interplanetary station will be at 17:00-18:00 Moscow time on the 12th and 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, October 10th, Moscow Dispatch: TASS, Moscow - The Soviet Union's first automatic interplanetary station reached its highest point away from the Earth's surface – the apogee – on the 10th. Sternfeld, a well-known Soviet expert on interplanetary flight research, commented on the current operation of the interplanetary station. He said that near the apogee, the interplanetary station lost its cosmic velocity, flying at 1,400 kilometers per hour (390 meters per second). Modern jet aircraft are now fully capable of matching it.

On October 11th, the automatic interplanetary station will regain cosmic velocity due to the influence of Earth's gravity and return near the Earth. At that time, it will be flying at 14,000 kilometers per hour (nearly 4 kilometers per second). This speed is only about 5% lower than the second cosmic velocity at such a distance from Earth – 4.15 kilometers per second (11.2 kilometers per second near the Earth's surface).

Sternfeld said that the orbit of the automatic interplanetary station in the Earth-Moon region has undergone considerable changes, mainly due to the interaction of the gravitational fields of the Earth and the Moon. However, since the interplanetary station parted ways with the Moon, the Moon has practically no further influence on the orbit of the "Third Little Moon." These changes were accurately estimated long before the rocket launch.

The orbit of the Soviet automatic interplanetary station will extend far beyond the orbit of the Moon (approximately 100,000 kilometers). Sternfeld said that the automatic interplanetary station will travel on a 1.3 million-kilometer orbit at an average speed almost the same as the Moon's orbital speed – approximately 1 kilometer per second. The center of the interplanetary station's orbit has shifted to 215,000 kilometers away from the center of the Earth. No natural celestial body has such a long orbit. Barring accidental collisions with meteorites, the "lifespan" of the interplanetary station is unlimited. The interplanetary station will pass near the Moon from time to time. In theory, the closest the interplanetary station will pass to the Moon, no more than 10,000 kilometers away, will not occur until early January 1967. However, in practice, it may be possible to observe the Moon much earlier, namely, when the interplanetary station is running its ninth, sixteenth, twenty-fifth, forty-first, sixty-sixth, and one hundred and seventh orbits. At that time, the distance between the interplanetary station and the Moon will be from 130,000 kilometers to 50,000 kilometers or even closer.

　　苏联行星际站到达远地点
    由于地球引力影响将开始返回地球附近
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科时间10月9日20时，苏联自动行星际站正在继续运行，位置在蛇夫座中，赤经为十六时四十分，赤纬为负二度三十六分。这时，自动行星际站在地球表面上空位置的座标是南纬三度，西经二十二度。它离地球表面的距离为四十六万六千公里。
    自动行星际站将在10月10日达到自己轨道的远地点，并将开始距离地球越来越近，10月18日20时将距离地球表面约四万公里，速度是每秒四公里。
    自动行星际站绕地球运转的一个周期约为十五个昼夜，一次运转将行经一百多万公里。
    据整理10月8日发送来的资料证明，行星际站的科学仪器、设备和自动装置继续正常工作。
    自动行星际站下次发送资料的时间将在莫斯科时间12日和15日17时至18时。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联第一个自动行星际站十日到达了离开地球表面的最高点——远地点。苏联研究星际飞行的著名星际专家斯特恩菲尔德对行星际站目前的运行情况发表了评论。他说，行星际站在远地点附近失去了宇宙速度，它每小时飞行一千四百公里（每秒钟三百九十米）。现代的喷气式飞机已经完全能够和它匹敌了。
    自动行星际站在10月11日将由于受到地球引力的影响重新获得宇宙速度，并返回地球附近。那时，它每小时将飞行一万四千公里（每秒钟将近四公里）。这种速度只比离开地球这样远的地方的第二宇宙速度——每秒钟四点一五公里（在地球表面附近是每秒钟十一点二公里）低5％吧了。
    斯特恩菲尔德说，自动行星际站的地球—月球区轨道发生了相当大的变化，这主要是由于地球和月球的引力场互相作用的结果。但是，自从行星际站和月球分道扬镖的时候开始，月球实际上已经不再对“第三号小月亮”的轨道发生影响了。这种变化是在火箭发射之前早已很精确地估计到了的。
    苏联自动行星际站的轨道将远远越出月球运行的轨道范围（约十万公里）。斯特恩菲尔德说，自动行星际站在一百三十万公里的轨道上，将以差不多和月球的轨道速度——每秒钟约一公里相同的平均速度运行。行星际站的轨道中心转移到离开地球中心二十一万五千公里之处。没有任何一个自然天体有拉得这样长的轨道。如果不去考虑同陨星相碰的偶然情况，行星际站“生存”期是无限的。行星际站将不时在月球不远之处通过。在理论上，行星际站要在最靠近月球，距月球不超过一万公里处通过月球，要到1967年1月初才能实现。但是，实际上可以在早得多的时候，即当行星际站运行第九、第十六、第二十五、第四十一、第六十六和第一百零七圈的时候，就可以顺利地观察到月球。那时行星际站和月球的距离将是从十三万公里到五万公里或更近一些。
