Finding Depth in Simplicity
—After Watching the Film “The Lin Family Shop”
Mei Qian

The film "The Lin Family Shop" vividly expresses profound ideological content with a simple artistic style, making it a fine work.

The story is very simple. It is nothing more than a small shop failing and closing down near the end of the year, the owner absconding, creditors seizing and liquidating assets, and small depositors suffering losses – a minor disturbance that was one of the thousands of "social trivia" happening every day in the old days. There are no sweeping strategies or magnificent "raging waves" here, just as the film suggests in its opening shot: a basin of sewage poured into a small ditch, causing only a slight ripple in the stagnant water. However, through realistic and simple artistic descriptions, we see the enormous social significance and complex class relations behind this ordinary event, making it a microcosm reflecting the face of the old era. The film's editors closely linked the rise and fall of the Lin Family Shop with the fate of the entire era. Although focusing on small details, it takes a broad perspective. Through the arrangement of certain plots, such as students giving propaganda speeches on the street to resist Japanese goods, crowds of people fleeing from Shanghai, Shanghai merchants pressing for payment, and looting by scattered soldiers, etc., these plots, though brief, even just one or two shots, accurately project the turbulent face of that era onto this small shop and drive the development of characters and events. The Lin Family Shop's struggling, barely surviving, temporary false prosperity, and eventual bankruptcy were inevitable products of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China under imperialist armed aggression, political darkness, economic collapse, rural bankruptcy, and industrial and commercial decline. The film reflects things far beyond the narrow scope of the Lin Family Shop. Because it firmly grasps the internal connection between the fate of the Lin Family Shop and the entire turbulent era, it allows us to see the world in a grain of sand and perceive the suffering that the Chinese people experienced during that historical stage. The concise and profound technique of the film's director and editor is one of the excellent characteristics of our nation's traditional literature and art.

The film reveals very complex class relations through the portrayal of the character of Boss Lin and the conflicts between him and the surrounding characters. Judging from both the director's handling and Comrade Xie Tian's performance, it can be said that a real and vivid artistic image has been successfully created, which is a gratifying achievement in film art creation in recent years. First of all, this character bears a very clear class imprint. Among small business owners, he is not a mediocre person; he is calm, capable, and well-versed in human relationships and social customs, and also has considerable cunning and means. He possesses the nature of ordinary merchants and private owners who seek self-interest at the expense of others and prioritize profit. His superficial honesty cannot conceal his inner cunning and deceit. When resisting Japanese goods, he uses bribery to secretly replace Japanese goods with domestic goods labeled with domestic trademarks to deceive customers. He is adept at competing with his peers, not hesitating to sacrifice his capital to compete for customers, and then secretly raising prices. When the "January 28th Incident" broke out and refugees flocked to the small town, he seized the opportunity to create "one-yuan goods" to do big business. He desperately tries to support the situation and struggle out of the predicament, but due to the impact of the overall economic collapse, he only sinks deeper and deeper, eventually being completely submerged. He is a character in a sandwich, on the one hand, being cruelly exploited by superiors like Bureau Chief Bu and Chairman Yu, who extort and squeeze him, forcing him to endure flattery while secretly swallowing bitter tears when he puts on a smiling face. On the other hand, he faces opponents like Qian Hunsun and Boss Chen, with whom he engages in deception, intrigue, mutual crushing, and gloating. Below him are Boss Wang and Zhu Santa and Widow Zhang, who are in even more miserable situations than him and who deposited their hard-earned money in his shop. When he asks Boss Wang for goods, he shows a ferocious face, regardless of the life or death of others; and he is even more ruthless and dark-hearted towards Zhu Santa and Widow Zhang, deceiving and coercing them. The film portrays the complexity of this character in a comprehensive and thorough manner. From his relationship with the surrounding characters, it profoundly reveals the cruel and ruthless social system of the big fish eating the small fish and the small fish eating the shrimp, forming a tragic picture of a class society stained with blood and tears, making us feel sincere sympathy for Zhu Santa and Widow Zhang. The film uses an extremely cold tone to write about Boss Lin's pitiful situation on the one hand, and carefully reveals his ugly inner world on the other, which is very profound. The film's portrayal of the character of Boss Lin also grasps the characteristics of simplicity and refinement. It does not place him more in some superficially emotionally激越, sword-drawn and crossbow-drawn confrontation scenes, but subtly reflects those sharp contradictions through the changes in his mood. Boss Lin's triumph, bitter smile, contemplation, anxiety, his stunned silence, forced composure... all have rich and substantial content, all reflecting the huge changes and contradictions of external things, giving rise to far-reaching associations. For example, when Boss Lin goes to Hengyuan Bank to borrow money to deal with the Shanghai merchants, and returns disappointed, walking alone on Wangxian Bridge on a snowy night, standing on the bridge and meditating, the superimposed image of the Shanghai merchants sternly demanding appears on the screen. This scene, due to its blend of emotions and scenery and its profound artistic conception, makes Boss Lin's situation of being surrounded by enemies and having no way out even more vivid. I think this can leave a deeper impression than writing a scene of two people arguing face to face. This refined conception enables the film to achieve strong artistic effects on a simple tone.

    于朴素中见深刻
    ——影片“林家铺子”观后
    梅阡
    影片“林家铺子”以一种朴素的艺术风格生动地表现了深刻的思想内容，可以说是一部佳作。
    故事十分简单。这不过是在年关前后一家店铺亏累倒闭，老板潜逃，债权人查封清理，小存户受到损害的一个旧时代的小风波。这是当时每天都在发生着的千万件“社会琐闻”之一。这里并没有什么纵横捭阖，气势磅礴的“惊涛骇浪”，正像影片在开始一个镜头所暗示的：一盆污水倾倒在一条小河沟里，不过是一点死水微澜而已。但是通过真实而朴素的艺术描写，使我们看到在这一平凡事件背后的巨大的社会意义，及其复杂的阶级关系。使它成为反映了旧时代面貌的一个缩影。影片编者把林家铺子的盛败兴衰和整个时代的命运紧密地联系了起来。虽于小处落墨，却从大处着眼。通过一些情节的安排，例如学生在街头为抵制日货的宣传讲演，从上海涌来仓皇逃难的人群，上海客人的坐逼货款，散兵游勇的敲诈勒索等等。这些情节虽然着墨不多，有的甚至只一两个镜头，但却准确地把那个时代动乱的面影投射到这个小小店铺里来，而且推动着人物与事件的发展。林家铺子的勉强挣扎，苟延残喘，暂时虚假的繁荣以及最后的倒闭，正是处在帝国主义武装侵略下，政治黑暗，经济崩溃，农村破产，工商业雕蔽萧条的半封建半殖民地旧中国的必然产物。影片所反映的事物远远超出林家铺子的狭窄的范围之外。由于它牢牢掌握住林家铺子的命运和整个动乱时代的内在联系，这就使我们能于一粒砂里见世界，透视到在那一历史阶段中国人民所经历过的苦难的岁月。影片编导这种言简意赅，意境绵邈的手法，是我们民族传统的文学艺术优秀的特点之一。
    影片通过对林老板这个人物的刻划，和他与周围人物之间的矛盾冲突，显示了十分复杂的阶级关系。无论从导演的处理和谢添同志的表演看来，可以说是成功地塑造了一个真实而生动的艺术形象，这是近年来电影艺术创作中一个可喜的收获。首先这个人物身上带着十分鲜明的阶级烙印。在小工商业者中间他不是一个平庸之辈，他沉稳干练，深通人情世故，也颇有心机手段。具有一般商人私有者损人利己、唯利是图的本性。他表面上的老成本份，掩盖不住内心的狡猾机诈。在抵制日货的时候，他却通过贿赂手段，偷天换日，以日货换贴国货商标来欺蒙顾客。他是同行竞争的能手，不惜牺牲血本来争夺主顾，然后再暗中加码。当“一二八”战争爆发，逃难的人们流落到这小镇上来，他又抓住时机搞出“一元货”的花样来大作生意。他拼命想支撑残局，从困境中挣扎出来，但是由于整个经济崩溃的影响，他只有越陷越深，终于惨遭没顶。他是个处在夹壁中的人物，一方面受着上层的卜局长、余会长之类残酷的压榨，对他强取豪夺，敲骨吸髓，他不能不忍痛奉承，在他陪着笑脸的时候也暗咽辛酸的眼泪。他的对面又有钱猢狲、陈老板之类的对手，他们之间尔谲我诈，钩心斗角，相互倾轧，幸灾乐祸。在他的下面又有着比他处境更惨的王老板和把血汗钱存在他店里的朱三太、张寡妇等人。当他向王老板提货的时候，一样不顾别人的死活，露出一副狰狞的面目；而对于朱三太和张寡妇更是手辣心黑，软欺硬骗。影片对这个人物的复杂性刻划得面面俱到，饱满淋漓。从他和周围人物的关系中，深刻地揭露了那种大鱼吃小鱼、小鱼吃虾米的残酷无情的社会制度，构成一幅血泪斑驳的阶级社会悲惨的图景，使我们对朱三太、张寡妇产生由衷的同情。影片以极其冷峻的笔调，一方面写出林老板可悯的处境，一方面又细致地揭示了他丑恶的内心世界，极有深度。影片对于林老板这个人物的刻划，笔调也掌握了朴素洗练的特色。并没有把他更多地放在一些表面上感情激越，剑拔弩张的相互冲击的场面之中，而是把那些尖锐的矛盾斗争，通过他心情的变化细腻地反映出来。林老板的得意，苦笑，沉思，焦炙，他的愕然无语，强作镇定，……都具有丰富而充实的内容，都反映了外在事物巨大的变化和矛盾。使人发生深远的联想。例如在林老板为应付上海客人到恒源钱庄去借款，失望归来，雪夜里在望仙桥边踽踽独步，站在桥头沉思，这时画面上出现了上海客人声色俱厉的叠影。这一场面由于它的情景交融，意境深远，结果把林老板四面楚歌，走投无路的处境体现得更加鲜明。我看这要比写一场二人正面争吵的戏，能够给人留下更深的印象。这种精炼的构思，使得影片在朴素的基调上收到强烈的艺术效果。
