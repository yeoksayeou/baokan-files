Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR , head of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation, arrived in Beijing this morning aboard a Tu-114 special plane and was warmly welcomed by Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and other party and state leaders including Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Lin Biao. Comrade Khrushchev is visiting at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Zhu De of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Premier Zhou Enlai to attend the celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Also arriving in Beijing were Comrade Gromyko, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, and Academician A.N. Tupolev, Chief Aircraft Designer of the Soviet Union, who are members of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation.

Comrade Khrushchev delivered an enthusiastic speech at the airport, saying: Dear Comrade Mao Zedong! Dear Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai! Dear Comrades and Friends!

I am very happy to be invited as your guest to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party has inspired and organized its people to fight for the victory of the revolution, for the high tide of the economy, and for the transformation of the national economy according to new socialist principles, and has already achieved great success. We are happy for your achievements and wish you continued progress in building socialism and building communism.

Our two parties were together in the most difficult times in the past, we are now working together towards the great goals, and will jointly move towards the construction of a communist society in the future - the pinnacle of the common efforts of the people of all countries to make revolutionary transformations of society.

After my visit to the United States of America and my return to Moscow, I came directly to you, practically jumping from one plane to another. In the United States, I met and held talks with the leaders of the United States, mainly with President Dwight Eisenhower. During these meetings and talks, we exchanged views very frankly on all the issues that need to be resolved in order to create an atmosphere of cooperation, peaceful coexistence, and guarantee world peace.

The trip to the United States and the talks held there were beneficial and should undoubtedly lead to an improvement in Soviet-American relations and a relaxation of international tensions. All efforts must be made to truly purify the atmosphere and create conditions for friendship among all peoples. We should do everything possible to strive for such a situation in order to ensure world peace.

We have put forward proposals at the United Nations General Assembly for the implementation of complete and thorough disarmament and the establishment of effective supervision. If these proposals are responded to, understood, and supported by all countries, they can bring about a fundamental change in relations between all peoples. It can be seen from our proposals that the Soviet Union is prepared to have the disarmament issue resolved in the broadest possible way in order to truly create conditions for the security of all peoples. At that time, the people of both large and small countries will not have to worry about being invaded, because no country will have the means to invade. This will be a great achievement for the people of all countries, for ensuring peace, and for creating an atmosphere of friendly relations. This will be the specific guarantee of peaceful coexistence that the people of all countries need, the development of international friendly relations, and the development of economic, cultural, and other ties.

The Soviet government has repeatedly stated, and I reiterated in my speech to the United Nations General Assembly, that without a large country like the People's Republic of China, the United Nations cannot become a truly universal international cooperation organization, nor can it become an international tool for fully and effectively resolving all international problems. I said at the United Nations General Assembly that it is long overdue to kick the reactionary Chinese Chiang Kai-shek clique of corpses out of the United Nations. Great socialist China should obtain its due seat in the United Nations. No matter how stubbornly the reactionary forces resist, this will definitely be achieved. Justice will surely prevail.

Friends! I have arrived in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. I now represent the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, our entire nation, and in my own name, I extend my heartfelt and friendly respect to the fraternal Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's China, and all the great Chinese people.

Long live the People's Republic of China, confidently advancing towards the victory of socialism under the banner of Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China!

Long live the powerful socialist camp - the indestructible fortress of world peace!

Comrade Khrushchev's speech sparked bursts of warm applause.

    赫鲁晓夫到京受到热烈欢迎
    毛主席、刘主席等党和国家领导人到机场迎接
    赫鲁晓夫祝贺中国人民建设社会主义的巨大成就
    据新华社30日讯　苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席、苏联党政代表团团长尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志，今天上午乘图—114式专机到达北京，受到了毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席以及党和国家的其他领导人宋庆龄、董必武、朱德、周恩来、林彪等的热烈欢迎。赫鲁晓夫同志是应毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席、朱德委员长和周恩来总理邀请前来参加中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝典礼的。
    同时到达北京的，有苏联党政代表团团员、苏联共产党中央委员会委员、苏联外交部部长葛罗米柯同志和苏联飞机总设计师安·尼·图波列夫院士。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在机场上发表了热情的讲话，他说：亲爱的毛泽东同志！亲爱的刘少奇同志、朱德同志和周恩来同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我很高兴受到邀请作你们的客人来参加中华人民共和国建国十周年庆典。
    中国共产党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，鼓舞和组织了本国人民为革命的胜利、为经济的高涨和按着社会主义新原则改造本国经济而斗争，并且已经取得了巨大的成就。我们为你们的成就感到高兴，并祝你们继续前进建成社会主义，建设共产主义。
    我们两党过去在最艰难的时刻同在一起，我们现在携手奔赴伟大的目标，将来共同走向共产主义社会的建成——各国人民为对社会进行革命改造而作的共同努力的顶峰。
    我访问美利坚合众国回到莫斯科以后，立刻就到你们这里来，简直就是从一架飞机跨到另外一架飞机上。我在美国同美国的领导人、主要是同德怀特·艾森豪威尔总统进行了会晤和会谈。在这些会晤和会谈期间，我们极其坦率地就一切需要解决的问题交换了意见，以便创造合作、和平共处和保证世界和平的气氛。
    美国之行和在那里进行的会谈是有益的，无疑应当导致苏美两国关系的改善和国际紧张局势的缓和。必须竭尽一切努力，真正使气氛洁净，为各国人民的友好创造条件。我们应当尽一切努力来争取这样的局面，以便保证世界和平。
    我们在联合国大会上提出了实行全面彻底裁军并建立有效监督的建议。这些建议如果得到所有国家的响应、理解和支持，就能引起各国人民之间关系的根本变化。从我们的建议中可以看出，苏联准备使裁军问题得到最广泛的解决，以便真正为各国人民的安全创造条件。那时候，无论是大国和小国的人民，谁都不必担心遭受侵犯，因为那时任何国家也没有侵犯的手段了。这将是对于各国人民、对于保证和平和创造友好关系的气氛的一个伟大成就。这将是各国人民所需要的和平共处，发展国际友好关系，发展经济、文化和其他联系的具体保证。
    苏联政府曾经多次声明，我在联合国大会的演说中又重申了我们的观点：联合国中如果没有中华人民共和国这样的大国，就不能成为一个真正普遍性的国际合作机构，就不能成为充分有效地解决所有国际问题的国际工具。我曾经在联合国大会上说，早就是该把中国反动派的僵尸蒋介石集团赶出联合国的时候了。伟大的社会主义中国应当在联合国取得自己应有的席位。不管反动势力如何顽抗，这是一定会做到的。公理必将胜利。
    朋友们！我到了中华人民共和国的首都北京，我现在代表苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联政府、我们全国人民，并以我个人的名义向兄弟的中国共产党中央委员会、人民中国的政府和全体伟大的中国人民致以衷心的、友好的敬意。
    在马克思列宁主义旗帜下满怀信心地走向社会主义胜利的中华人民共和国万岁！
    苏联和中华人民共和国两国伟大人民永久的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    强大的社会主义阵营——不可摧毁的世界和平堡垒万岁！
    赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话，激起了一阵又一阵热烈的欢迎掌声。

    十时四十五分，赫鲁晓夫同志乘坐的专机平稳降落在首都机场。红光满面、精神焕发的赫鲁晓夫同志步出机舱后，含笑招手向欢迎的人们致意，这时机场上爆发出春雷般热烈的鼓掌声。毛泽东主席，刘少奇主席，宋庆龄、董必武副主席，朱德委员长，周恩来总理，林彪副总理兼国防部长等，以及社会主义各国的领导同志们，都走到飞机前面迎接贵宾。
    乐队奏苏联和中国的国歌。赫鲁晓夫同志由毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席和周恩来总理陪同，检阅了中国人民解放军陆海空三军仪仗队。首都儿童向赫鲁晓夫同志和苏联党政代表团的全体贵宾献了鲜花。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫同志和苏联的全体贵宾们同前来欢迎的中外人士握手，这时机场上爆发一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
