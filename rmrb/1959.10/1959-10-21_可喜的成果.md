A widespread and in-depth study movement of the Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has gradually unfolded in universities and colleges across the country. The broad masses of teachers and students, having studied the documents, have enhanced their political awareness, recognized the situation, and mustered revolutionary vigor, thereby raising even higher the red flag of the education revolution, defending the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," and confidently taking steps in the continued Great Leap Forward. Under the brilliant illumination of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Zhejiang University, with its campus full of the colors of spring and the continuous emergence of new achievements, is an inspiring example.

The example of Zhejiang University once again proves that as long as universities and colleges adhere to putting politics in command, thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, and continuously muster their energy, they can better implement the Party's education policy; they can continue the Great Leap Forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward in all aspects such as teaching quality, productive labor, and scientific research. We believe that we will soon see such encouraging achievements from other universities and colleges.

    可喜的成果
    一个广泛深入的学习党的八届八中全会决议的学习运动，已在全国高等学校中逐渐开展起来了。广大师生学习了文件，提高政治觉悟，认清形势，鼓足了革命干劲，从而更高地举起了教育革命的红旗，捍卫党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，信心百倍地迈开了继续大跃进的步子。浙江大学在党的八届八中全会的光辉照耀下，真是春色满校园，新的成就不断涌现，就是一个令人振奋的例子。
    浙江大学的例子又一次证明：高等学校只要坚持政治挂帅，彻底反掉右倾，不断鼓足干劲，就能更好地贯彻执行党的教育方针；就能在教学质量、生产劳动和科学研究等各个方面，在去年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进。我们相信：很快就会从其他高等学校看到这种可喜的成果。
