Xinhua News Agency, 16th. At the invitation of our country, the Algerian National Football Team, a group of eighteen people led by team leader Mustafa and deputy team leader Mohammed, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon.

Those who welcomed them at the airport included Zhang Lianhua, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, Li Fenglou, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Football Association, and Chinese football players. The backbone of the Algerian football team used to be players of the French national team and first-division professional football teams. Because they supported their motherland's liberation movement, they collectively left France last April and returned to Algeria, overcoming many difficulties. The visiting team will play against the Liaoning football team in Beijing on the 18th of this month.
