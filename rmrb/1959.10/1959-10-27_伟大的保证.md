    Great Guarantee
    Wu Lü
    "We must hold high the glorious red banner of the General Line, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance along the road of victory towards new and even more magnificent goals! Strive forward! Strive forward!" This is the great guarantee that Comrade Liu Ningyi, on behalf of over three million advanced producers and over thirty million workers across the country, made to the Party and Chairman Mao at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade.
    The Great Leap Forward has opened up a new era in China's path of socialist construction. Since then, our country's national economy has embarked on a course of high-speed development faster than any previous period. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the main targets of the magnificent Second Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule this year. The slogan of "catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years" will be basically realized in about ten years. The Chinese people's long-cherished dream of completely changing our country's poor and backward state, and building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science, will become a reality in a relatively short period. All this is brought about by the situation of the Great Leap Forward. "Advance! Strive forward!" This is the greatest interest and most urgent demand of the people of the whole country. The oath made by the outstanding sons and daughters of the working class to the Party and Chairman Mao at the "Heroes' Gathering" represents the will of the people of the whole country and shouts out the voice in the hearts of the people of the whole country.
    The will of the people is the direction of history, and no reactionary force in the world can stop the advance of the wheel of history. Things that do not meet the requirements of history will surely collapse; things that meet the requirements of history will surely be victorious. This is the great truth of historical materialism. Foreign enemies slander our Great Leap Forward, and right-leaning opportunists in our ranks also attack the Great Leap Forward, but the steed of the Great Leap Forward moves forward without the slightest hesitation, and this is precisely the reason.
    Of course, it is not to say that there are no difficulties on the road ahead. There will always be some difficulties of one kind or another. Revolutionary causes without difficulties have never existed in the past and will not exist in the future. We have the strong leadership of the Party. As long as we hold high the red banner of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, we will surely overcome difficulties and be invincible. The Party's General Line for socialist construction is a creative Marxist-Leninist line. It not only solves individual problems in our country's socialist construction, but also solves the most general and essential problems in our country's socialist construction, which is the problem of giving the fullest play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people. The people are the creators of history, and their enthusiasm and creativity are given the fullest play, which is an invincible force that no difficulty in the world can stop.
    Advanced producers are the pioneers of the Great Leap Forward. They are opening up the road of the Great Leap Forward, and using their advanced thinking, advanced quotas, and advanced experience to encourage thousands of ordinary producers to climb to the advanced level, so that the production level of a few advanced elements becomes the production level of the whole society in the era of the Great Leap Forward, becoming an extremely rapid process that has never been seen in history. The advanced producers' oath of "Great Leap Forward! Another Great Leap Forward!" will surely make our socialist construction cause like the endless Yangtze River, mighty and rolling forward!

    伟大的保证
    吴滤
    “我们一定高举总路线的光辉红旗，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，沿着胜利的道路，向着新的更加宏伟的目标，前进，奋勇前进！”这是全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上，刘宁一同志代表全国三百多万先进生产者和三千多万职工，向党和毛主席提出的伟大的保证。
    大跃进，在中国的社会主义建设道路上，开辟了一个新的时代。从此，我们国家的国民经济开始了比过去任何时期都要迅速的高速度发展的航程。经过1958年和1959年的大跃进，宏伟的第二个五年计划的主要指标将在今年内提前完成，“十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平”的口号将可以争取在十年左右的时间内基本实现，中国人民梦寐以求的彻底改变我国贫穷和落后的面貌，把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家的理想，将在一个比较短的时期内变成现实。这一切，都是大跃进的形势带来的。“前进！奋勇前进！”这就是全国人民最大的利益和最迫切的要求。“群英会”上工人阶级的优秀儿女向党和毛主席所作的誓词，代表着全国人民的意志，喊出了全国人民心里的声音。
    人民群众的意志是历史的方向，世界上任何反动力量都不能阻挡历史车轮的前进。不合乎历史要求的事情，一定会垮掉；合乎历史要求的事情，一定要胜利。这是历史唯物主义的大道理。国外的敌人诬蔑我们的大跃进，我们队伍里的右倾机会主义分子也攻击大跃进，大跃进的骏马却一往直前，并无半点迟疑，也正是这个道理。
    当然，并不是说在前进的道路上就没有什么困难了。这样或那样的困难总是会有一些的。没有困难的革命事业，过去不曾有过，将来也不会有。我们有党的坚强的领导，只要我们高举党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，我们一定能战胜困难，无往而不胜。党的社会主义建设总路线，是一条创造性的马克思列宁主义的路线，它不只是解决了我国社会主义建设中的个别问题，而且解决了我国社会主义建设中的最普遍和最本质的问题，这就是最充分地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性的问题。人民群众是历史的创造者，他们的积极性和创造性得到最充分的发挥，这是世界上任何困难也不能阻挡的无敌的力量。
    先进生产者是大跃进的先驱。他们开拓着大跃进的道路，用自己的先进思想、先进定额和先进经验，鼓舞着千千万万普通生产者攀上先进的水平，使少数先进分子的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的过程，在大跃进的年代里成为历史上从来不曾有过的极其迅速的过程。先进生产者发出的“大跃进！再大跃进！”的誓言，必将使我们的社会主义建设事业像不尽的长江一样，浩浩荡荡、滚滚向前！
