Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the Baogang builders worked hard and cleverly, launching extensive technical innovations and mass movements. They not only completed this large blast furnace one year ahead of schedule, with an actual effective construction period of twelve months, but also ensured the quality of the project. After inspection and appraisal by the Acceptance Committee, the welding quality of the main projects and the No. 1 blast furnace body was found to be fully qualified by gamma-ray (radium photography) inspection; the quality of the carbon brick and refractory brick masonry of the large blast furnace body was the best, exceeding design requirements and receiving praise from Soviet experts. The quality of the three hot blast stoves greatly exceeded the national requirements standard after pressure testing. The quality of the blast furnace main hoist and the No. 1 steam blower is excellent.

At the acceptance meeting held on the 13th, all members of the State Acceptance Committee, combined with the smooth production of the large blast furnace for more than half a month since it was put into operation, unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the quality of the large blast furnace, believing that this is a brilliant achievement of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 15th. The Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise has entered a new stage of simultaneous basic construction and production. Since the second half of this year, it has produced a large number of products such as pig iron, coke, steel ingots, and iron ore to support production and construction in many regions of the country.

With the commissioning of the No. 1 large blast furnace and the continuous increase in pig iron production, Baogang now ships more than 1,000 tons of pig iron to Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Shenyang, Qiqihar, and other places every day. The open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, and converters of the Baogang Machinery General Plant and Steel Materials Plant, which have already been put into production, also mostly ship steel ingots to Shanghai, Tianjin, and the Northeast. The metallurgical coke produced by the large coke ovens of the Baogang Coking Plant is very popular in various regions. Recently, after the second large coke oven of Baogang was put into production, together with the first large coke oven, in addition to ensuring that the Baogang No. 1 blast furnace is well fed, it can support various regions with nearly 1,000 tons of metallurgical coke every day. Iron ore from Baiyunebo began to support various parts of North China as early as last year.

　　一号高炉系统工程被评为优等  每天有大批产品调出支援各地
    新华社包头15日电　包钢一号高炉验收委员会13日开会，一致评定一号高炉系统工程为优等质量。一号高炉系统工程的主要项目有三十一项，工程量大，技术复杂。包钢建设者们在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，苦干巧干，大搞技术革新和群众运动，不但以十二个月的实际有效工期提前一年建成这座大型高炉，而且保证了工程质量。经过验收委员会验收鉴定，其中主要工程和一号高炉本体的焊接质量，经用嘎玛射线（镭光照相）检验全部合格；大高炉炉体的炭砖和耐火砖砌筑质量最好，超过设计要求，受到苏联专家好评。三座热风炉经过打压试验，质量大大超过国家规定的要求标准。高炉主卷扬机和一号蒸气鼓风机的质量都是优等。
    国家验收委员会的全体成员在13日举行的验收会议上，结合大高炉开炉半个多月以来顺利生产的情况，对大高炉的质量一致表示满意，认为这是党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的灿烂成果。
    新华社包头15日电　包头钢铁联合企业已经进入基本建设和生产同时并进的新阶段。今年下半年以来，它已生产了大批生铁、焦炭、钢锭和铁矿石等产品，支援了全国许多地区的生产建设。
    随着一号大型高炉的投入生产和生铁产量的不断增长，包钢现在调往北京、上海、太原、武汉、沈阳、齐齐哈尔等地的生铁，每天共达千吨以上。已经投入生产的包钢机械总厂和钢铁材料厂的平炉、电炉、转炉，生产的钢锭也大部外调上海、天津和东北等地。包钢焦化厂大型焦炉所产的冶金焦炭，很受各地欢迎。最近包钢第二座大型焦炉投入生产后，它和第一座大型焦炉一起，除了保证包钢一号高炉吃饱吃好外，每天可以以近千吨的冶金焦炭支援各地。白云鄂博的铁矿石，早在去年就开始支援华北各地。
