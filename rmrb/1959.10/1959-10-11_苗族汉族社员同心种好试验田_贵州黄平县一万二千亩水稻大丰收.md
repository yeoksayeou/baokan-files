　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, October 10th: The rice experimental plots cultivated by eight people's communes in Huangping County, Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, have generally achieved high yields. The 12,266 mu of rice experimental plots that have already been harvested in these eight communes have produced an average of 1,519 jin of dry grain per mu, with one mu and one fen yielding 3,350 jin.

　　Under the leadership and mobilization of the Huangping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, more than 4,800 commune members and cadres of Miao, Han, and other ethnic groups participated in planting rice experimental plots throughout the county. The experimental plots were distributed in high mountains, plains, and mountain gullies.

　　The greatest gain from planting experimental plots in Huangping County is the exploration of some experiences in implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" in a way that suits local conditions. These experiences are: good deep plowing, reasonable close planting, and the use of different improved varieties according to different soil properties, depth of plowing, and soil fertility. The 7.23 mu of rice trial-planted in Jiuzhou Commune, after being deeply ploughed to a depth of more than 1.5 chi, yielded an average of 1,670 jin per mu, an increase of 79.8% compared to the un-deeply ploughed fields. The entire commune also conducted eight types of experiments on close planting, and the results showed that: planting 50,000 seedlings per mu yielded 1,520 jin per mu, 10,000 seedlings per mu yielded 1,180 jin per mu, and 27,000 seedlings per mu yielded 2,278 jin per mu. The commune conducted experiments on eight varieties, and in the same field with the same processing, the yields were very different. The introduced varieties "5782 Grain" and "800 Grain" yielded more than 2,000 jin per mu; the local varieties "Xiaobaili" and "Mazhan" yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu. The former two varieties had high yields, were resistant to fertilizer, had strong disaster resistance, and matured early, proving that these improved varieties were suitable for fertile fields. At the same time, the comparative experiments showed that more fertilizer is good, but fertilizer should be applied reasonably; for various natural disasters, frequent inspections should be carried out to give priority to prevention; and in management, it is necessary to ensure that seedlings pass the five stages of "turning green, tillering, jointing, heading, and irrigation," and where water conservancy conditions are good, shallow water irrigation is best. In addition, everyone unanimously agreed that the various aspects of the "Eight-Character Charter" should be well-coordinated, and there is a mutual promotion and interdependence between the various measures. These experiences have powerfully broken down the conservative ideas of some people who believe that "reasonable close planting is not good," "deep plowing is a waste of effort," and "fertile fields cannot be closely planted."

　　苗族汉族社员同心种好试验田
    贵州黄平县一万二千亩水稻大丰收
    据新华社贵阳10日电　贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州黄平县八个人民公社种植的水稻试验田普遍丰产。这八个公社已收割的一万二千二百六十六亩水稻试验田，平均亩产干谷一千五百一十九斤，其中有一亩一分地亩产三千三百五十斤。
    在中共黄平县委的领导和带动下，全县参加种水稻试验田的有苗、汉等族社员和干部四千八百多人。试验田分布在高山、平坝和山沟。
    黄平县种试验田的最大收获，是探讨出了一些因地制宜贯彻“八字宪法”的经验。这些经验是：深耕好，密植要合理，根据土壤性质、深耕程度、土质肥瘦等不同情况采用不同良种。旧州公社试种的七点二三亩水稻，深耕一尺五寸以上，平均亩产一千六百七十斤，比未深耕的增产79.8％。全社还就密植作了八种试验，结果证明：每亩栽种五万窝的亩产一千五百二十斤，每亩一万窝的亩产一千一百八十斤，每亩二万七千窝的亩产二千二百七十八斤。这个公社进行了八个品种的试验，在同一块田，同样的加工，产量却大不相同。引进品种“5782号谷”和“800粒”品种，亩产二千多斤；本地种“小白粒”和“麻粘”等，亩产一千多斤。前两种品种产量高，耐肥，抗灾力强，成熟期早，证明肥田适用这类良种。同时，从对比试验中说明，肥料多的好，但要合理施肥；对各种自然灾害，应勤检查，做到以防为主；管理上要保证秧苗过好转青、分蘖、拔节、抽穗、灌溉等五关，在水利条件好的地方，最好做到浅水灌溉。此外，大家还一致认为：“八字宪法”各条之间要配合好，各项措施之间有互相促进和互相依存的关系。这些经验，有力地破除了部分人认为“合理密植不好”、“深翻土地白费劲”、“肥田不能密植”等的保守思想。
