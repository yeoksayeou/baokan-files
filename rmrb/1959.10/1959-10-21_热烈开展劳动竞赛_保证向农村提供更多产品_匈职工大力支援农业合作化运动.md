Xinhua News Agency, Budapest Telegram: Hungarian industrial departments are vigorously launching labor emulation drives, increasing production, and supporting the agricultural cooperation movement.

Since March of this year, workers and staff in the agricultural machinery manufacturing sector have launched a labor emulation drive to ensure that the 15% increase in agricultural machinery production targets set for this year is raised to 34%. During the competition, workers and staff actively strived to over fulfill their guarantees. For example, the Red Star Tractor Factory in Budapest proposed to overproduce 150 tractors and 2 million forints worth of machine parts this year. By the end of September, they had already overproduced 130 tractors and 3 million forints worth of parts. Now, the factory's workers are advancing victoriously, promising to overproduce a total of 205 tractors and 4 million forints worth of machine parts this year. The "Emag" agricultural machinery factory has largely completed its task of increasing production of 326 grain combine harvesters, and the Zimbathel Agricultural Machinery Factory is about to realize its guarantee of increasing production of 1,080 corn planters.

Workers and staff in the chemical industry sector are also trying to produce more chemical fertilizers for the countryside. For example, the Borsod Chemical United Factory and the Pete Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant decided to increase production of 21,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer this year. However, these two factories have also proposed a guarantee to increase production by another 6,600 tons of nitrogen fertilizer. Other chemical fertilizer plants have also completed their guarantee to overproduce 21,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, and by the end of the year, these plants will overproduce another 2,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer according to plan. The construction sector is also vigorously supporting the agricultural cooperation movement. According to statistics from the Ministry of Construction, investment in agricultural production cooperative construction this year is more than the total investment from 1950 to 1958. In order to enable the livestock of the peasants who joined the cooperative to be quickly concentrated in modern collective livestock sheds, construction workers decided to build 462 more livestock sheds for the cooperative than planned.

Due to the technological innovation and hard work of construction workers, 229 livestock sheds have been completed by the end of September, and the rest will be completed by the end of October. The construction sector also supplied a large amount of building materials to the countryside this year, including 34 million bricks, more than 30,000 tons of cement, nearly 50 tons of quicklime, more than 640,000 square meters of tiles, and nearly 26,000 square meters of glass.

In addition, factory directors, party committee secretaries, accountants, and the majority of workers and staff often go to the countryside to help newly established agricultural production cooperatives solve various difficult problems and carry out political propaganda work. Their enthusiastic support has greatly encouraged the members of the agricultural production cooperatives, making their labor enthusiasm increasingly high. (Attached Picture)

    热烈开展劳动竞赛　保证向农村提供更多产品
    匈职工大力支援农业合作化运动
    新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利各个工业部门大力开展劳动竞赛，增加生产，支援农业合作化运动。
    今年3月以来，农业机械制造部门的职工就开展劳动竞赛，保证要把今年农业机械生产计划规定的增加15％的指标提高到34％。而在竞赛过程中，职工又纷纷争取超额实现自己的保证。例如，布达佩斯的红星拖拉机工厂提出了今年要超额增产一百五十台拖拉机和价值二百万福林的机器零件的任务。到9月末，他们已经超额增产了一百三十台拖拉机和价值三百万福林的零件。现在，这个工厂的职工正在乘胜前进，提出保证，要在今年共超额增产二百零五台拖拉机和价值四百万福林的机器零件了。“埃马格”农业机械厂提出的增产三百二十六台谷物联合收割机的任务目前已大部完成，紫姆巴特赫农业机械厂增产一千零八十台玉米播种机的保证也就要实现了。
    化学工业部门的职工也在想方设法为农村多生产化学肥料。例如，包尔绍德化学联合工厂和佩特氮肥厂决定今年要增产二万一千吨氮肥。然而这两个工厂又提出了再多增产六千六百吨氮肥的保证。其他化学肥料厂目前也已经完成了超额增产二万一千吨磷肥的保证，到年底，这些厂还要超计划增产二千吨磷肥。建筑部门也在大力支援农业合作化运动。据建筑部统计，今年用于农业生产合作社建筑方面的投资比1950年到1958年投资的总额还多。为了使入社农民的牲畜能很快地集中到现代化的集体畜舍中，建筑工人决定超计划为合作社多建造四百六十二个畜舍。
    由于建筑部门职工革新技术，发挥干劲，到9月末已经建成二百二十九所畜舍，其余的在10月底就将全部完成，建筑部门今年还多供应了农村大量建筑材料，其中包括三千四百万块砖，三万多吨洋灰，近五十吨生石灰，六十四万多平方米瓦，将近二万六千平方米的玻璃。
    此外，还有很多工厂的厂长、党委书记、会计和广大职工常常到农村去，帮助新成立的农业生产合作社解决各种困难问题和进行政治宣传工作。他们热情的支援给予了农业生产合作社社员很大的鼓舞，使他们的劳动情绪日益高涨。（附图片）
