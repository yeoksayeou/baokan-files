Xinhua Daily News reports: Over seven million mu of cotton in Jiangsu Province have entered the peak boll-opening season. The cotton-growing areas are a sea of silver, with a moving scene of a bumper harvest. The work of picking new cotton is in full swing. As of October 8th, the province had harvested 4,070,000 dan of seed cotton, nearly twice the total annual output before liberation. The average yield per mu is about 60 jin of seed cotton, a twofold increase compared to the same period last year. The purchase of new cotton is also underway. As of the 6th, the province's purchases had increased to 860,000 dan.

This year, Jiangsu Province has earnestly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" in cotton production and relied on the strength of the people's communes to overcome drought. The cotton bolls are numerous and large. Generally, each plant has seven to nine summer bolls and five to seven autumn bolls, an increase of 23% compared to last year. This year, cotton generally began to open in late July and early August, a solar term earlier than in previous years. In Suzhou Prefecture, 640,000 mu of cotton began to be harvested in mid-September. To date, the average yield per mu has reached 115 jin of seed cotton, 30 jin more per mu than in the same period last year. This year's cotton has many large bolls, early, fast, and abundant flowering, bright white color, good lint percentage, long fiber, and strong elasticity. The commune members said happily: This year's cotton is picked and then opens, picked on the left and opens on the right, picked below and opens above. Even "Thousand-Hand Guanyin" would not be able to pick it all in time. Changshu County, which has the most cotton planting area, has harvested an average of 130 jin of seed cotton per mu on more than 370,000 mu of cotton fields. A large number of high-yield fields and high-yield areas have also appeared in various places. In Guizhuang Commune, Taicang County, seven brigades including Mi Jing and Chen Jing have 120 mu of cotton fields with an average yield of over 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among them, 1.5 mu of high-yield fields in the Mi Jing Brigade have yielded 505 jin per mu.

Recently, in the "Three Exceeds and Five Comparisons" bumper harvest movement in the cotton-growing areas of Jiangsu Province, the vast number of commune members are carefully picking new cotton while also grasping late-stage management to ensure a bumper harvest. In Nantong County, Nantong Prefecture, each commune has generally established specialized cotton-picking teams during the cotton-picking season, responsible for contracting to the end. They also held on-site meetings for seed selection and retention to select good cotton seeds and strive for a greater harvest next year. (Attached picture)

　　江苏棉田翻银浪  农民拾花笑开颜
    据新华日报消息　江苏省七百多万亩棉花进入吐絮盛期，棉区一片银海，丰收景象十分动人，采摘新棉工作紧张展开。到10月8日止，全省已收获子棉四百零七万担，超过解放前全年总产量近两倍；平均每亩拾子棉六十斤左右，比去年同期增长二倍。新棉收购工作也在同时进行，到6日止，全省收购量增加到八十六万担。
    今年江苏省在棉花生产中认真执行了“八字宪法”，依靠人民公社的力量战胜了旱魔，棉桃结得又多又大，一般每株有七至九个伏桃和五至七个秋桃，比去年增加了二点三成。今年棉花一般在7月底、8月初就开始吐絮，比往年提早了一个节气。苏州专区六十四万亩棉花，从9月中旬就开始收摘，到目前止，平均每亩已收子棉一百一十五斤，比去年同期每亩多收三十斤。今年棉花铃多铃大，开花早、开花快、开花多，色泽洁白，衣分好、纤维长、弹性强。社员们高兴地说：今年的棉花是前摘后开，左摘右开，下摘上开，就是“千手观音”也来不及收摘。种棉最多的常熟县，三十七万多亩棉田，平均每亩已收子棉一百三十斤。各地并出现了大批的丰产田、丰产片。太仓县归庄公社迷泾、陈泾等七个大队有一百二十多亩棉田平均每亩已收子棉三百斤以上，其中迷泾大队有一点五亩丰产田每亩已收五百零五斤。
    近日来，江苏省棉区广大社员在“三超五比”丰产丰收运动中，一面精收细拾新花，一面狠抓后期管理，确保丰产丰收。南通专区南通县各公社在收花期间，普遍建立了拾花专业队，负责包干到底；还召开了选种留种现场会，选好棉种，争取明年更大丰收。（附图片）
