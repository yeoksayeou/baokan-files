Ore Production Must Take the Lead

	The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called on the people of the whole country to complete the production task of 12 million tons of steel this year. This great call has inspired the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to build socialism, and good news has been pouring in from the steel production front in recent days. To ensure the early and overfulfillment of the production task of 12 million tons of steel, there must be sufficient pig iron; and to produce sufficient pig iron, there must first be sufficient iron ore and other auxiliary raw materials. Ore is the foundation of steel production, and in order to complete and fulfill this year's steel production plan ahead of schedule, ore production must take the lead.
	Since the beginning of this year, the situation of ore production has been good. From January to September, the national iron ore production has completed 92.2% of the annual state plan, and the absolute output has increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year; among them, the ore produced by local small and medium-sized mines has increased by seven times compared with the same period last year. The output of manganese ore, magnesite, and fire-resistant clay has also increased by one to two times compared with the same period last year. The quality of various ores has also generally increased, and the average grade of iron ore has increased by 1% to 3% compared with the planned target. Entering October, there has been a great improvement compared to September.
	Although the current situation of ore production is very good, in order to ensure the completion of the steel production plan, especially because the vast number of workers in steel enterprises have put forward the goal of completing and overfulfilling this year's steel production plan ahead of schedule, new and higher requirements have been put forward for the production of ore raw materials. Mining enterprises must work even harder, not only to complete the plan, but also to greatly overfulfill the plan, in order to ensure that the blast furnace is "well-fed and well-nourished," and to achieve reserves and turnover. At the same time, in order to adapt to the continued leap forward in steel production and mining production next year, at this time, all mining enterprises must also actively prepare for mining. The task before the black metallurgical mining workers is quite arduous, but the objective situation for completing this task is also very favorable. First of all, the Party Central Committee's call to oppose right-leaning ideas and encourage greater efforts to further carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of mining workers, everyone is full of energy and high morale, and in a short period of time, the appearance of all production links has been completely renewed. This revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses is the most fundamental guarantee for completing the production task. Secondly, there is the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward last year and this year, and there is a solid material foundation. In addition to the larger mines, many of the small, indigenous mines produced during the national mass steelmaking campaign last year have now grown and have a certain scale. At present, these small and medium-sized mines undertake nearly half of the national iron ore production task. Due to the large-scale operation of small indigenous mines, the number of iron ore enterprises in the country has rapidly developed from more than 20 in 1958 to more than 300 now, manganese ore enterprises have developed from 4 to more than 20, and clay mines have developed from 5 to more than 30, thereby changing the uneven distribution of mines across the country, and supplying the needs of the blooming of the steel industry everywhere. The growth and strengthening of small indigenous mines has become a new force in this year's ore production. Third, after several months of efforts, the organization and management of enterprises in various mines has been further strengthened, and a relatively complete set of work systems and methods has been established. After a year of training, the technical level of tens of millions of mining troops has been greatly improved, and labor efficiency has generally increased by one to two times. These favorable conditions, coupled with the active leadership and support of party committees at all levels for mining production, provide a reliable guarantee for the comprehensive overfulfillment of ore production tasks.
	To overfulfill the ore production task, we must see clearly these favorable conditions, make full use of these favorable conditions, and at the same time, we must take specific guidelines and measures. The working policy of the national black metallurgical mines in the next three months should be: to deeply carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign centered on improving mining intensity and strengthening mining preparation, focusing on improving the four major indicators of mineral processing, and aiming at high yield, high quality, and low cost, and strive for a double leap forward in mining and mining preparation (stripping), and a comprehensive harvest of the four major indicators of mineral processing. To this end, the first thing to do at present is to vigorously increase the production of various ores such as iron ore, manganese ore, and fire-resistant clay to meet the needs of the soaring daily output of steel. At the National Black Metallurgical Mining Conference held by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Pangjiabao Mine recently, specific production increase figures were put forward for 14 key enterprises and various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. All units must ensure the completion of this plan and supply the smelting department with sufficient ore in quantity, quality, on time, and in variety. At the same time, all localities should further promote indigenous sintering and simple washing methods to make full use of mineral resources. While vigorously increasing ore production, it is also necessary to solve the transportation problem accordingly. On the one hand, we must seize the construction of transportation lines and strengthen cooperation with the outside world; on the other hand, we must actively organize the masses to carry out short-distance transportation in a concentrated manner, make full use of the gaps between farm work and the slack farming season, and quickly transport the ore accumulated in various mines as early as possible and put it into production. Secondly, in order to prepare for next year's ore production, all mines must resolutely complete and overfulfill the mining preparation (stripping) task. The mining preparation efficiency of the 14 key mines should be greatly improved on the existing level to ensure that no less than three months of mining volume can be provided for next year by the end of the year. Small and medium-sized mines belonging to various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should also make plans. Third, it is necessary to strengthen technical management, improve ore quality, take various effective measures to reduce the loss and impoverishment of ore in the production process, and strengthen manual selection work to ensure that "gangue does not enter the vehicle and waste rock does not go down the mountain." In addition to ensuring that the planned quality indicators are met, all localities should also strive to improve by 1%-3% on this basis to create favorable conditions for improving the quality of steel products. Fourth, while increasing production, we must practice strict economy. All mines should reduce material consumption by about 10% to 5% on the existing level, so that both increased production and economy can leap forward.
	Adhering to putting politics in command, continuing to oppose right-leaning ideas and encouraging greater efforts is the most fundamental measure to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of ore production. As long as we thoroughly overcome right-leaning ideas, muster enough energy, and fully mobilize the masses, the ore production task will definitely be fully overfulfilled. In order to fully supply the raw materials needed for steel production, all mining enterprises should take urgent action and move forward rapidly along the road pointed out by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party!

### 矿石生产必须一马当先

　　矿石生产必须一马当先
    党的八届八中全会号召全国人民在今年完成一千二百万吨钢的生产任务，这一伟大号召激发了全国人民建设社会主义的热情，钢铁生产战线连日捷报频传。保证提前和超额完成一千二百万吨钢的生产任务，必须要有足够的生铁；而生产足够的生铁，首先要有足够的铁矿石和其他辅助原料。矿石是钢铁生产的基础，为了完成和提前完成今年的钢铁生产计划，矿石生产必须一马当先。
    今年以来，矿石生产的状况是良好的。1至9月，全国铁矿石产量已经完成全年国家计划的92.2％，绝对产量比去年同期增长了两倍以上；其中地方中小型矿山所产的矿石比去年同期增长了七倍。锰矿石、菱镁矿石和耐火粘土等，也比去年同期增长了一倍到两倍以上。各种矿石的质量也普遍上升，其中铁矿石的平均品位比计划指标提高了1％到3％。进入10月又比9月有了很大提高。
    目前矿石生产的形势虽然很好，但为了确保钢铁生产计划的完成，特别是由于当前钢铁企业广大职工提出了提前和超额完成今年钢铁生产计划的奋斗目标，因而对矿石原料的生产就提出了新的更高要求。矿山企业必须更加一把劲，不仅要完成计划，而且要大大超额完成计划，才能保证高炉“吃饱、吃好”，做到有储备、有周转。同时，为了适应明年钢铁生产和矿山生产的继续跃进，这一时期，各个矿山企业也必须积极作好采矿准备工作。摆在黑色冶金矿山职工面前的任务是相当艰巨的，但是完成这一任务的客观形势也是十分有利的。首先，党中央提出的反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展增产节约的号召，极大地鼓舞了矿山广大职工的生产热情，人人意气风发、斗志昂扬，在短期内就使各个生产环节面貌焕然一新。这种广大群众的革命干劲，就是完成生产任务的最根本的保证。其次，有了去年和今年大跃进的丰富经验，有了雄厚的物质基础。除了较大的矿山之外，去年全民大办钢铁中产生的小型的土法生产的矿山，现在很多已经成长壮大，具有一定规模。目前这些中小型矿山担负着全国将近一半的铁矿石生产任务。由于大办小土矿山，全国铁矿企业的数量由1958年的二十多个，迅速发展到现在的三百多个，锰矿企业由四个发展到二十多个，粘土矿由五个发展到三十多个，并由此改变了全国矿山分布不均的状况，就近供应了钢铁工业遍地开花的需要。小土矿山的成长壮大成为今年矿石生产中的一支新生的力量。第三，各矿山经过几个月的努力，企业组织管理进一步的加强，有了一套比较完整的工作制度和方法。几千万采矿大军经过一年来的锻炼，技术水平有了很大提高，劳动效率一般提高了一至二倍。以上这些有利条件，加上各级党委对矿山生产的积极领导和支持，就为全面超额完成矿石生产任务提供了可靠的保证。
    超额完成矿石生产任务，必须看清这些有利条件，充分运用这些有利条件，同时还必须采取具体的方针和措施。全国黑色冶金矿山在今后三个月的工作方针应当是：深入地开展以提高采矿强度、加强采矿准备为中心，以提高选矿四大指标为重点，以高产优质低成本为目的的增产节约运动，力争采矿、采矿准备（剥离）双跃进，选矿四大指标全面丰收。为此，当前首先要大力增产铁矿、锰矿、耐火粘土等各种矿石，以满足钢铁的日产量扶摇直上的需要。最近冶金部在庞家堡矿召开的全国黑色冶金矿山会议上，对十四个重点企业和各省市及自治区分别提出了具体的增产数字。各单位必须确保完成这一计划，按量、按质、按时、按品种供应冶炼部门以充足的矿石。同时，各地要进一步推广土法烧结和简易的洗选方法，以充分利用矿产资源。在大力增产矿石的同时，还必须相应地解决运输问题，一方面抓紧运输线路的铺建，加强同外部的协作；另一方面还要积极组织群众突击短途运输，充分利用农事间隙和农闲的季节，迅速把积存在各矿山上的矿石及早运出，投入生产。其次，为了做好明年矿石生产的准备工作，各矿山必须坚决完成和超额完成采矿准备（剥离）任务。十四个重点矿山的采矿准备效率应在现有水平上大大提高一步，保证到年底能为明年提供不少于三个月的回采矿量。各省市及自治区所属中小型矿山也应做好规划。第三，要加强技术管理，提高矿石质量，采取各项有效措施，降低矿石在生产过程中的损失贫化，并加强手选工作，做到“夹石不入车、废石不下山”。各地除了要保证达到计划质量指标以外，还应该力争在这一基础上提高1％—3％，为提高钢铁产品的质量创造有利条件。第四，在增产的同时，必须厉行节约。各矿山应在现有的水平上把材料消耗再降低10％至5％左右，使增产、节约双双跃进。
    坚持政治挂帅，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，这是保证完成和超额完成矿石生产的最根本的措施。只要彻底克服了右倾，鼓足了干劲，充分发动起群众，矿石生产任务就一定能够全面超额完成。为了充分供应钢铁生产所需要的原料，各矿山企业应该紧急行动起来，沿着党的八届八中全会所指出的道路，快马加鞭，奋勇前进！
