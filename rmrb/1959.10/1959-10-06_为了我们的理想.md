    For Our Ideals
    Yang Yizhong, Yunnan Yili River Hydroelectric Power Bureau

    More than half a year of labor on the construction site, the forging of a seething Great Leap Forward life, the enthusiastic edification of thousands of builders, the Party's meticulous cultivation and education, have made a young man like me, who had not been away from school for long, understand what the lofty ideal of a builder is, and understand what happiness and joy it is to dedicate oneself to such a lofty ideal.

    For our ideals, we call the desolate mountains home and the flowing water our companions all day long! We will use our own hands to turn the desolate mountains into paradise and the flowing water into gasoline! This is our political slogan and also our program of action!

    For our ideals, our enthusiasm soars to the sky! With only a pair of omnipotent hands, we will cut through the towering mountains, and move mountains to fill the deep valleys! The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains was just a myth in the past, but now it has become a reality.

    For our ideals, we always listen to the Party. Whatever the Party calls on us to do, we do it unconditionally! In order to complete the reservoir dam ahead of schedule, we cleaned the foundation barefoot in the biting cold water during the freezing winter nights, never complaining about the cold! We have a fiery heart, burning our whole bodies to a boil! In the hot summer, we fought day and night, finally breaking through the long tunnel and building the dam to the predetermined elevation, forcing the fierce flood to bow its head and flow into the tunnel!

    We understand that happiness is created by our own hands, and nature will never bestow it! If we want happiness, we must fight against society and nature! Our revolutionary predecessors, for our happiness, climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed grasslands…shedding their last drop of blood, finally destroyed the shackles of the old society, and won the great victory of the people's revolution, liberating us from the shackles of slavery, and laying the foundation for a society where we can freely and peacefully create happiness. The task that falls on our shoulders is to transform nature, control nature, and make nature a source of our happiness!

    For our ideals, we deeply love this ordinary work of ours. If we carry one more load of soil, or move one more cart of slag, we will create one more fraction of the material foundation of communism. We love labor, we are full of optimism, and we do not care about personal gains and enjoyment. We live in small shacks, but they are better than the high-rise buildings in the city; although it is difficult for us to hear the sound of singing and dancing, the mutual harmony of the sound of locomotives, motors, and wind drills is better than Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony! In the era of Mao Zedong, every corner of the motherland is filled with happiness!

    For our ideals, we firmly support the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party! Exert greater effort, strive for the upstream, and continue to leap forward! We pledge to the Party that with our practical actions, we will definitely overfulfill this year's Great Leap Forward plan, and definitely complete the 7 million cubic meter reservoir dam ahead of schedule, and support factories and rural areas with more than 300,000 kilowatts of hydropower.

    For the cause of hydropower in the motherland, we are willing to dedicate our lives! We will not only turn the flowing water of the Yili River into gasoline and the barren mountains of Dongchuan into paradise, but also turn all the flowing water in Yunnan, the border region of the motherland, into gasoline and all the villages into cities that never sleep!

### 为了我们的理想

    为了我们的理想
    云南以礼河水力发电局　杨毅中
    半年多的工地劳动，沸腾的跃进生活的锻冶，千百个建设者热情的熏陶，党的细心的培植和教养，使我这样一个离开学校不久的青年，懂得了什么才是建设者的崇高理想，懂得了为这样一种崇高的理想而献身是怎样的快乐和幸福。
    为了我们的理想，整日价荒山为家，流水相伴！我们要用自己的双手，把荒山变为乐园，把流水变成汽油！这是我们的政治口号，也是我们的行动纲领！
    为了我们的理想，我们干劲冲天！仅凭一双万能的手，要把巍峨的高山，穿腹而过；要把深阔的山峡，移山填平！愚公移山，在过去只是神话，到现在却已成为事实。
    为了我们的理想，我们始终听党的话。党号召我们干什么，我们就无条件地干什么！为了提前建成蓄水大坝，在严寒的冬夜，我们光着脚，在刺骨的冰水中清基，从未喊冷！我们有一颗火热的心，把全身都燃烧得沸腾！在炎热的盛夏，我们昼夜奋战，终于把长大的隧洞打通，把大坝筑到预定高程，使凶暴的洪水不得不低头向隧洞流去！
    我们懂得：幸福是自己的双手创造出来的，自然决不会恩赐！我们要幸福，就必须同社会和自然进行斗争！我们的革命先烈，为了我们的幸福，爬雪山、过草地，……流尽了自己最后的一滴血，终于摧毁了旧社会的枷锁，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利，把我们从奴隶的桎梏下解放了出来，给我们奠定了一个能自由而和平地创造幸福的社会。落在我们双肩的任务：就是改造自然，驾驭自然，使自然成为我们幸福的源泉！
    为了我们的理想，我们十分热爱自己这一平凡的工作。我们多挑一挑土，多出一车渣，就是多创造了一分共产主义的物质基础。我们热爱劳动，我们充满乐观，我们不计较个人的得失与享受。我们住的是矮小的工棚，但它胜过城市的高楼大厦；虽然我们很难闻到歌舞之声，但机车声、马达声、风钻声的相互交奏，则胜过贝多芬的田园交响曲！在毛泽东的时代，祖国的每一个角落都洋溢着幸福！
    为了我们的理想，我们坚决拥护党的八届八中全会的决议！鼓干劲，争上游，继续跃进！我们向党提出保证：用自己的实际行动，一定超额完成今年的跃进计划，一定提前建成七百万土方的蓄水大坝，把三十多万瓩的水电支援工厂和农村。
    为了祖国的水电事业，我们愿意贡献出自己的一生！我们不仅把以礼河的流水变成汽油，东川的荒山变为乐园，而且要把祖国的边疆——云南，所有的流水都变成汽油，所有的乡村都变成不夜城！
