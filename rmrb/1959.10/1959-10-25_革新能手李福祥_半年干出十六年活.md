Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 24th: The renowned advanced producer, Li Fuxiang, a boring worker at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, had completed sixteen years and ten months' worth of work in just six and a half months of actual workdays by October 17th. Among these achievements, thirty-nine of his fifty-nine technical innovation suggestions have been implemented, saving over 34,100 work hours, equivalent to fifteen years and six months of work. This means he has achieved his promise of "doing sixteen years of work in one year" ahead of schedule. He has been selected as an advanced producer representative of Shanghai to attend the National "Conference of Heroes."

Since 1954, Li Fuxiang has been working on drilling machines. Due to his continuous innovation in drilling operation methods and improvement of various tools, he has been recognized as an advanced producer every year. In February of this year, the processing of boring machine parts often failed to meet the needs of assembly on time, affecting the completion of the factory's production plan. At this point, Li Fuxiang left the drilling machine he had operated for many years and went to the relatively backward boring machine section. Initially, he couldn't even operate the forward or reverse gears of the boring machine well. After more than a month of learning, he quickly mastered the operating techniques of the boring machine and was able to identify problems and innovate. When processing part blanks on the boring machine, the tool needed to be adjusted after the first cut. Manual adjustment of the tool was not accurate and time-consuming, with tool adjustment taking up about half of the production time each day. After several days of research, Li Fuxiang developed a "eccentric live boring row" tool to replace manual tool adjustment. When he applied the "eccentric live boring row" to process gearboxes, the production time was repeatedly reduced, from the original twenty-four hours to just six hours to complete one. The boring machine workers learned from Li Fuxiang's experience and also carried out technical innovations on a large scale. In the past six months, the workers of the boring machine team have put forward more than one hundred technical innovation suggestions. In August and September, the whole team generally overfulfilled the task, creating an unprecedented all-around success. Li Fuxiang also put forward more than thirty suggestions, which increased the production efficiency of various processed parts by 50% to six times, and he overfulfilled his task every month. In September, he completed the entire month's task in twelve working days, and in October, he completed the entire month's task in just seven working days. Under the leadership of Li Fuxiang, the formerly relatively backward boring machine team has become an advanced collective in the entire factory.

Li Fuxiang often treats the difficulties of others as his own, becoming a "trailblazer" who constantly fights against difficulties. In late February, the processing of large screws, one of the main parts for the factory's manufacturing of 280-ton large boilers, became a "stumbling block." These screws were as thick as rice bowls, and it took four people two days to process just one manually. Li Fuxiang was very anxious when he saw this situation and took the initiative to help the workers processing the screws by using a drilling machine instead of manual processing. The production efficiency increased dozens of times. On the eve of his departure for Beijing to attend the National "Conference of Heroes," Li Fuxiang also worked overnight to manufacture a pneumatic drill sand cleaning machine for the foundry workshop to replace manual sand cleaning, increasing production efficiency by seven times.

Li Fuxiang continuously shares his operating experience with others. Since the beginning of this year, he has sent more than twenty copies of his own innovative tool sketches and other related technical materials to factories in various places.

    革新能手李福祥
    半年干出十六年活
    新华社上海24日电　到10月17日止，著名的先进生产者、上海锅炉厂镗工李福祥在今年六个半月的实际工作日里，完成了十六年零十个月的工作量。其中，他提出的五十九条技术革新建议已实现三十九条，节约三万四千一百多个工时，相当于十五年零六个月的工作量，提前实现了他提出的“一年干十六年活”的保证。他已经被选为上海市出席全国“群英会”的先进生产者代表。
    从1954年以来，李福祥一直在钻床上操作。由于他不断革新钻工操作法，并且改进了多种工具，年年被评选为先进生产者。今年2月，镗床零件加工经常不能按时供应装配的需要，影响全厂生产计划的完成。李福祥这时离开他多年操作的钻床，到生产比较落后的镗床去操作。起初，他连镗床顺车、倒车都开不好。经过一个多月学习，他迅速掌握了镗床的操作技术，并能发现问题，进行革新。在镗床上加工零件毛坯，镗了第一刀后就要调整刀具。用手工调整刀具不够准确，又费时间，一天的生产时间调整刀具就占了一半左右。李福祥经过几天钻研，研究出一种“偏心活络镗排”的工具，用来代替手工调整刀具。他在应用“偏心活络镗排”加工牙齿箱的时候，生产时间一再压缩，从原来的二十四小时，缩短到六小时就完成了一个。镗床工人们学习李福祥的经验，也大搞技术革新。半年多来，镗床组的工人提出了一百多条技术革新建议，在8、9两月中全组普遍超额完成了任务，出现了从没有过的满堂红局面。李福祥也提出了三十多条建议，使各种加工件的生产效率提高了50％到六倍，并且月月超额完成任务。9月份，他以十二个工作日完成了全月的任务，10月份更以七个工作日完成了全月任务。一向比较落后的镗床组，在李福祥的带动下，一跃成为全厂的先进集体。
    李福祥经常把别人的困难当作自己的困难，成为不断向困难作斗争的“闯将”。2月下旬，厂里制造二百八十吨大型锅炉，主要零件之一的大螺丝的加工成了“拦路虎”。这种螺丝有饭碗那么粗，四个人用手工加工，两天才能加工一只。李福祥看到这种情况很着急，主动帮助加工螺丝的工人用钻床代替手工加工。生产效率提高了几十倍。李福祥在动身去北京出席全国“群英会”的前夕，还连夜为铸工车间制造了一台风钻清砂机代替人工清砂，生产效率提高七倍。
  李福祥不断把自己的操作经验传授给别人，今年以来，他已经向各地工厂送出了二十多份自己革新工具的草图，和其它有关的技术资料。（附图片）
