    Industrial practice in our socialist construction has proven that implementing the policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements in industry is a crucial guarantee for the high-speed development of China's industry. This is the specific application of our Party's organizational principle of democratic centralism and the working method of the mass line in industrial production. Only by correctly combining these two aspects can we build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Our experience in this area has become richer and more complete through the recovery period, the period of the First Five-Year Plan, and especially the Great Leap Forward of last year.
Socialist Enterprises Must Mobilize the Broad Masses to Participate in Management

    During the process of socialist construction in our country, there was a period when some factories and enterprises exhibited the following situation: They excessively emphasized top-down administrative centralized management, neglecting bottom-up mass mobilization. In particular, some leading cadres of large enterprises mistakenly believed that modern factories and enterprises were highly technical, with fine divisions of labor, and complex organizations, and therefore could only be managed centrally from top to bottom, and were not suitable for carrying out vigorous mass movements. This resulted in a situation where a small number of people ran the enterprise in a cold and detached manner. The enthusiasm and creativity of the masses could not be fully developed, and the production potential of factories and enterprises could not be fully realized. After the great All-People Rectification Movement and the Great Leap Forward of 1958, this situation has undergone significant changes. The vast majority of leading cadres in factories and enterprises have improved their understanding of the combination of centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements, and have better integrated them in their practical work. They not only paid attention to strengthening centralized leadership, but also paid attention to mobilizing the masses and carrying out vigorous mass movements. This spurred the boundless production enthusiasm hidden among the broad masses of workers to erupt like a volcano. Workers threw themselves into the booming Great Leap Forward with high spirits and full vigor. The mass movement of the great production Great Leap Forward in 1958 was not only clear in its goals and concentrated in its strength, but also powerful and broad in its scale, developing wave upon wave, each wave higher than the last, fiercely impacting all right-leaning conservative thinking. It continuously created new records in production and constantly emerged with surprising innovations and inventions in technology. It achieved the great victory of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industrial production in 1958, writing a new and glorious page in the history of industrial development in our country. In 1959, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the mass movement was further developed, and it has been and is achieving continued leap forward results. This fully proves the correctness of the policy of centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements.

    Why must centralized leadership be correctly combined with vigorous mass movements in order to achieve high-speed development of industrial production?

    The mass line is the basic line and basic working method of our Party. We must rely on the masses and go through the masses in whatever work we do. The people are the creators of history. This is a basic principle of Marxism. The mass line of our Party is proposed based on this principle. The 38-year history of struggle of our Party fully proves the correctness of this line. We adhered to this line in the democratic revolutionary war, strengthened the revolutionary forces, and achieved the victory of the revolution. In today's socialist revolution and socialist construction, we must also adhere to this line in order to accelerate the development of socialism. In our socialist country, the people are the masters of the country. They have fundamentally changed the status of the oppressed and exploited. The relationship between them and the leaders is an equal, comradely, and mutually cooperative relationship. Their interests and the interests of the leaders are also consistent, and there is no conflict of interest. Everything proceeds from the interests of the masses, and everything is for the masses. This is the purpose of all work of our Party. The policies and guidelines of our Party at any period are a reflection of the demands of the masses. They come from the masses and represent the interests of the masses. Precisely because the Party's interests and the masses' interests are so consistent, we can organize the broad masses into various political, economic, and armed struggles, and achieve victory in these struggles.

    In the past revolutionary struggle, we boldly mobilized the masses and carried out vigorous mass movements. In today's socialist construction, we must, without exception, also boldly mobilize the masses and carry out vigorous mass movements. Factories and enterprises are places where the working class is concentrated, and it is especially necessary to carry out vigorous mass movements. Only by carrying out vigorous mass movements can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and achieve the goal of building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Chairman Mao told us that whatever work we do, we must adopt the method of combining leadership with the masses. In our socialist enterprises, since the workers are the masters of the enterprise, we should let them directly participate in the management of the enterprise. It is inconceivable that the Party organization of a socialist factory enterprise, as well as the Party and administrative leaders, can only sit in the office to listen to reports, issue orders, or only rely on a few experts, without relying on the masses, without listening to the opinions of the masses, without treating the masses as the masters of the enterprise, and not consult with the masses when problems occur, and yet still be able to handle things well. Practice has proven that last year we universally implemented the system of cadres participating in physical labor, cultivating experimental fields, appearing as ordinary laborers, eating, living, and working with the workers, consulting with the masses when encountering problems, and implementing the "two participations, one transformation, and three combinations," which improved the relationship between leaders and the masses. These played an extremely important role in inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses and fully mobilizing their initiative and creativity. The total industrial output value completed in 1958 exceeded any year since liberation, and this was inseparable from the bold mobilization of the masses, the vigorous mass movements, and the conscientious implementation of the mass line last year.

    Any mass movement we carry out serves a certain political and economic purpose. The mass movement in our factories and enterprises is no exception. Last year's mass movement to develop iron and steel was aimed at realizing the goal of taking steel as the key link to drive the overall leap forward of other work. The increase production and economize movement centered on high production and high quality that we are carrying out this year is aimed at better and more comprehensively completing the output, quality, and cost targets. The technical revolution and technical innovation movement that we launched last year and this year is aimed at reducing working hours, reducing the consumption of materialized labor, and continuously improving labor productivity by continuously reforming the technological process, reforming production tools and operating methods, improving equipment, and improving product design.

    The Party's Centralized Leadership is a Component of the Party's Mass Line

    However, to organize the vast majority of the masses into the movement, advance towards a single goal, and achieve our expected goals, it is only possible under the centralized leadership of the Party. This is because the most important aspect of the Party's centralized leadership is the leadership of the Party's policies and guidelines. The Party concentrates the will, wishes, and demands of the broad masses in a certain period, formulates a set of policies and guidelines that meet the needs of the masses, and then takes this set of policies and guidelines back to the masses for implementation. Because the policies and guidelines formulated by the Party come from the masses, they can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. In 1957, the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of catching up with Britain in the output of major products within fifteen years. In 1958, the Party Central Committee issued instructions against waste and conservatism, put forward the general line of building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and put forward the policy of "taking steel as the key link and leaping forward in an all-round way" and a whole set of policies of walking on two legs. Precisely because all of this correctly reflected the demands of the masses, it became the driving force that enabled us to launch a large-scale mass movement last year. They can touch the heartstrings of every worker who is eager to change the poor and blank face of the motherland, and can inspire their boundless wisdom and strength, thereby organizing them and forming a booming mass movement. Right-leaning opportunists attacked our policy of launching large-scale mass movements on the industrial front, especially attacking the mass movement of developing iron and steel, and described the vigorous mass movements of the proletariat and other working people as having been "boomed" up, as if they were due to coercive orders, rather than the consciousness of the masses, and so on. This is obviously absurd. Because, apart from those anti-Marxists who regard the masses as "idiots," no one can imagine that without the centralized leadership of the Party; if the Party's general line and a whole set of policies and guidelines did not reflect the demands of the masses; if the masses were not under the brilliance of the Party's general line, under the guidance of the Party's whole set of correct policies and guidelines, enlightened with a high degree of consciousness, how could such a large-scale mass movement have been formed last year, and how could such unprecedented and great achievements have been obtained! Therefore, it can be seen even more clearly that the right-leaning opportunists' slander of the enthusiasm for building socialism shown by the Party and the broad masses of the people in the Great Leap Forward last year as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism" is obviously a malicious attack.

    Another aspect of the Party's centralized leadership is how the Party can timely and correctly concentrate the positive and negative experiences gained by the masses in the movement, analyze, study, and summarize them, and then use them to promote the smooth and healthy development of the movement. In a large-scale mass movement, once the masses are fully mobilized, many creations and inventions will inevitably emerge. The Party needs to summarize these creations and inventions in a timely manner and promote them. At any time, there will be differences in the three states of advanced, intermediate, and backward among the masses. Mobilizing the masses is not just mobilizing the advanced, but more importantly, mobilizing those in a backward state so that the movement can be transformed from a mass movement participated in by a small number of masses to a mass movement participated in by the vast majority of masses. Last year, the Party adopted the method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, holding on-site meetings, and organizing evaluations and inspections in the mass movement. This prompted the advanced to become more advanced, and the backward to catch up with and surpass the advanced, forming a wave of emulation, and gradually improving the movement. At the same time, in the development process of the mass movement, certain shortcomings will inevitably arise. The Party needs to lead the masses to analyze the reasons for the shortcomings in a timely manner and overcome them in a timely manner. Last year, the Party put forward the combination of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do with seeking truth from facts, the combination of soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, the combination of hard work and rest, and the need to grasp both production and life in the mass movement. The proposal of this series of directional and policy-oriented issues is precisely the conclusion drawn by the Party from the positive and negative experiences of last year's mass movement. This is a very correct attitude adopted by the Party towards the mass movement, which fully proves that only under the centralized leadership of the Party is it possible to summarize the experience of the masses in such a timely and correct manner; and only under the centralized leadership of the Party can the experience of the masses be used to promote the further development of the industrial production movement. However, right-leaning opportunists have the opposite attitude towards the mass movement. They do not actively and enthusiastically support the mass movement, but stand beside the mass movement and point fingers. They only pay attention to certain local and temporary shortcomings in the mass movement and exaggerate them. They do not see that the achievements of the mass movement are the main fact. Obviously, if we summarize experience according to their point of view, it must be pouring cold water on the masses, dampening the enthusiasm of the masses, and hindering the in-depth development of the mass movement, and finally only canceling the mass movement.

    Therefore, we can draw the following conclusion: Only centralized leadership can have large-scale mass movements. The more in-depth the mass movement is, the more it needs to strengthen centralized leadership. With centralized leadership, it is possible to unify will, unify action, and correctly implement the policies and guidelines stipulated by the Party and the state for industrial enterprises. A mass movement without centralized leadership will become blind and spontaneous, and the movement cannot be carried out on a large scale. If we abandon centralized leadership, it will inevitably become the tail of the masses. This does not conform to the purpose and requirements of our vigorous mass movement.

    It must be clear that the Party's centralized leadership itself is a component of the Party's mass line. Without the Party's centralized leadership, there is no point in talking about the Party's mass line. The Party's centralized leadership we are talking about is based on the extensive promotion of democracy and has a mass foundation. Therefore, it can truly mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and enable them to fully play their role in production. If we separate centralized leadership from the Party's mass line, thinking that emphasizing the Party's centralized leadership means that we can ignore the opinions of the masses, fail to reflect the demands of the masses, and only use a set of management systems and management methods that are not suitable for the development of production to restrict the masses, this is a serious distortion of the Party's centralized leadership. Such centralized leadership will inevitably damage the enthusiasm of the masses, separate the leadership from the masses, and make the high-speed development of production impossible. Therefore, centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements must be combined. Only by combining them can we promote the high-speed development of production.

    From this, it can be seen that the Party's centralized leadership is not only not opposed to vigorous mass movements, but is also necessary for vigorous mass movements. Any statement that attempts to oppose the Party's centralized leadership to vigorous mass movements is completely wrong.

    Since last year, many comrades have gained rich experience in this area; however, some comrades still lack a correct understanding of the relationship between the two. Although they are different from right-leaning opportunists, they also have right-leaning conservative ideas. They have opinions on the temporary disruption of the original production order and the destruction of the old balance in the vigorous mass movements last year. They also have different views on the reform of rules and regulations. They have doubts about launching vigorous mass movements in industrial production, and they miss the old management methods that relied solely on administrative orders for centralized management, and always want to return to the old path. This is an erroneous manifestation of not believing in the masses and negating the Party's mass line, which we must resolutely oppose. At the same time, we must also oppose the erroneous statement that centralized leadership cannot carry out vigorous mass movements, and that to carry out vigorous mass movements, there can be no centralized leadership. The former's error lies in not believing in the masses, and the latter's error lies in treating centralized leadership as something that restricts the masses. The kind of centralized leadership that does not want the masses is the centralized leadership that we oppose. The kind of view that centralized leadership cannot carry out vigorous mass movements, and treats centralized leadership as something that restricts the masses is also incorrect. We must combine the two in order to facilitate the high-speed development of production.

    Three Principal Issues Need Resolution

    Currently, there are still several principal issues regarding the relationship between centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements in factories and enterprises that need to be resolved. Resolving these issues will facilitate vigorous mass movements and the continued leap forward of production.

    First, resolutely implement the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee. In factories and enterprises, the so-called centralized leadership is mainly concentrated in the leadership of the Party committee. Because the Party is the highest form of organization of the proletariat, the Party committee is the executor of the Party's line, principles, and policies, the core of the leadership of factories and enterprises, the representative of the interests of the masses, and the organizer of mass movements. With the centralized leadership of the Party, it is possible to mobilize and organize all aspects of forces to better mobilize and organize the masses and implement the Party's principles and policies. However, implementing the centralized leadership of the Party committee does not mean that the Party committee should take care of everything. Centralized leadership must be based on democracy. It is necessary to implement a division of labor and responsibility under collective leadership. Give full play to the role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and especially give full play to the role of administration. The administrative work of industrial and mining enterprises is the responsibility of the factory director. All administrative affairs should be under the unified command of the factory director. In this way, the Party's leadership will not be trapped in daily trivial matters, which will help strengthen the Party's political and ideological work and give full play to the Party committee's leading role. Otherwise, it will weaken the Party's leadership and create a situation where no one is responsible for production. Implementing an appropriate division of labor between the Party committee and the administration under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party committee is beneficial to doing a good job in production and fully mobilizing the masses.

    Second, correctly handle the relationship between enterprise management and vigorous mass movements. Our socialist factories and enterprises are modern enterprises with complex technology. Such enterprises, like a large symphony orchestra, need unified command to unify the will of the whole factory and the actions of the whole factory to ensure that production proceeds in an orderly and normal manner. In order to achieve this goal, enterprise management must have centralized management and a set of rules and regulations, management methods, and organizational structures that are adapted to it. There are currently two different understandings of how to view these organizational systems. For example, taking rules and regulations, one treats rules and regulations as immutable things, simply treating them as weapons to command the masses to carry out production and manage the masses. Therefore, it is regarded as something that is contradictory to vigorous mass movements. Is there a contradiction between rules and regulations and vigorous mass movements? In a sense, there is a contradiction and there is no contradiction. The purpose of establishing rules and regulations in our socialist factories and enterprises is to better and more comprehensively complete production tasks and ensure that production proceeds in an orderly manner, and to facilitate the enthusiasm of the masses. If the rules and regulations we have established do not rely on subjective wishes, but truly reflect the objective laws of the production process and are a summary of the practical experience of the masses, then not only will it not hinder the development of mass movements, but it will also be conducive to the enthusiasm of the masses. In this way, there is no contradiction between rules and regulations and vigorous mass movements. However, rules and regulations cannot be immutable and must be revised and changed as production develops and according to the requirements put forward by the practice of the masses. This inevitably leads to destruction and establishment. If some outdated rules and regulations are not broken, it will hinder the enthusiasm of the masses and be detrimental to the development of mass movements, and contradictions will arise. In the vigorous mass movements last year, the rules and regulations were broken and established through the masses' voicing of opinions, big-character posters, and some changes were made to the organizational structure. In most cases, these changes were completely necessary and met the requirements of production and the masses. Therefore, there is a contradiction between rules and regulations and vigorous mass movements, but they are also unified. The problem is that the leaders of the enterprise must be good at timely recognizing the new changes that have taken place in production, and recognize that when the masses come up with a major innovation in technology, they will inevitably put forward a request for certain changes to the old rules and regulations. If the outdated rules and regulations are insisted on, they will contradict the development of production and the mobilization of the enthusiasm of the masses. If corresponding changes are made, this contradiction can be resolved and will be conducive to the development of production. However, there is another erroneous understanding that they regard socialist rules and regulations as bourgeois rights, which are simply used to manage people, and treat them as something that is absolutely opposed to mass movements. Therefore, they advocate that if vigorous mass movements are to be carried out, there can be no more rules and regulations. This nihilistic view of denying all rules and regulations is very harmful. If we act according to this view, it will inevitably lead to the negation of centralized management, the abandonment of unified command, and cause chaos in production, making it impossible to better and more comprehensively complete the state plan. The above two kinds of understanding that treat rules and regulations as opposed to mass movements are incorrect. Practice has proven that in the vigorous mass movements last year, we broke and established the rules and regulations of the enterprise. It should be affirmed that many of them were broken correctly, which promoted the Great Leap Forward last year. The shortcomings are that some were broken too much, and some were broken inappropriately. The emergence of this phenomenon is difficult to avoid in a large-scale mass movement and is not worth making a fuss about. As long as we pay attention to it, the leadership will grasp it, and it is easy to overcome. However, those who have right-leaning views and believe that rules and regulations cannot be changed exaggerate these shortcomings. They seem to have sufficient reasons to deny the necessity of reforming rules and regulations and want to restore the rules and regulations that have been broken without distinction. We believe that this issue must be treated differently. Those that have been broken correctly must be affirmed, those that have been broken but not established should be established quickly, and those that should not have been broken should be restored quickly. Only in this way can we neither harm the enthusiasm of the masses nor be conducive to the development of production. Currently, the greatest danger in actual work is to restore all the rules and regulations that have been broken without distinction.

    Third, closely integrate the administrative management work method with the mass line work method. In factories and enterprises, it is not enough to have correct principles and policies, reasonable rules and regulations, and corresponding organizational structures. It is also necessary to have correct work methods to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state's tasks. There are two types of work methods: one is the administrative management work method. This management method is indispensable in factories and enterprises and is essential. With it, we can more systematically study the factory situation, formulate factory production plans, arrange production, organize raw material supply, inspect product quality, ensure safe production, strictly implement cost accounting, and many other works related to production. In this way, we can arrange production work in a more meticulous, solid, and comprehensive manner. However, some comrades regard this method as the only one, as if the factory can only rely on this method to do a good job in production. Therefore, they only rely on a few people to formulate plans, arrange production, and are unwilling to submit the plans to the masses for discussion. Even if they are submitted to the masses for discussion, it is just a formality. The root cause of their doing this is that they do not believe in the masses and are afraid that things will be "messed up" and increase troubles after the plans meet the masses. They are accustomed to sitting in the office to issue orders, opposing the administrative management work method to the mass line work method. We believe that socialist enterprises cannot rely solely on administrative management methods. Relying solely on this method will deviate from reality and deviate from the masses. We should combine the administrative management work method with the mass line work method in order to build production work on the basis of mass management, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, fully tap the potential of production, and make the productive forces develop at a high speed. Although the administrative work method and the mass line work method are different, they are not impossible to combine. Moreover, they are very easy to combine, as long as the leaders of the enterprise have a firm mass viewpoint, earnestly believe in the masses, explain the production plan, the difficulties in completing the production plan, and the favorable conditions to the masses, and mobilize the masses to discuss, ask them to come up with ideas, find ways, propose revisions to the plan, and propose measures, and continuously rely on the masses to solve the major problems that occur in production during the production process. As long as we earnestly do these things, the administrative management work method will naturally be combined with the mass line work method. Once these two methods are combined, they will generate a huge effect on promoting production. Therefore, we must walk on two legs in work methods. Treating the administrative management work method as the only method is not conducive to production. Similarly, only the mass line work method, denying the administrative management work method in general, will also have an adverse effect on production. This issue is still an issue that our factories and enterprises must correctly handle in the future.

    The Party's mass line is the lifeline of our Party. We must implement the Party's mass line in all our work. Using the method of launching vigorous mass movements to lead industrial production is the specific application of the Party's mass line on the industrial front. We have gained rich experience in the practice of the past decade, and we will further enrich its content in practical work in the future. Practice has proven that the idea that emphasizes the particularity of industry and believes that vigorous mass movements cannot be carried out is completely wrong; the idea and practice of opposing the Party's centralized leadership to vigorous mass movements is also completely wrong. All the attacks of right-leaning opportunists on the vigorous mass movements on the industrial front are not worth refuting.

    工业中的集中领导与大搞群众运动
    中共上海市委书记　曹荻秋
    我国社会主义建设的实践证明：在工业方面贯彻执行集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，是我国工业高速度发展的重要保证。这是我们党的民主集中制的组织原则和群众路线的工作方法在工业生产中的具体运用。只有把这两方面正确的结合起来，才能多快好省地建设社会主义。
    关于这方面的经验，经过恢复时期，经过第一个五年计划期间，特别是经过去年的大跃进就越来越丰富，越来越完备。社会主义企业必须发动广大群众参加管理
    在我国社会主义建设过程中，曾经有一个时期，有某些工厂企业出现了这样的情况：过多地强调自上而下的行政集中管理，忽视自下而上的发动群众。特别是有些大型企业的领导干部，错误地认为现代化工厂企业技术性强、分工精细、组织复杂，只能自上而下地进行集中管理，不适宜于轰轰烈烈地大搞群众运动，以致造成少数人冷冷清清办企业的局面，群众的积极性、创造性得不到充分发扬，工厂企业的生产潜力得不到充分发挥。经过伟大的全民整风运动和1958年的大跃进，这种情况，有了显著的改变。绝大部分工厂企业的领导干部对集中领导和大搞群众运动在认识上有了提高，在实际工作中有了比较好的结合。他们既注意了加强集中领导，又注意了发动群众，大搞群众运动，从而促使蕴藏在广大职工群众中的无穷无尽的生产热情像火山喷发一样地涌现出来，广大职工意气风发、干劲十足地投入了轰轰烈烈的大跃进的热潮。1958年伟大的生产大跃进的群众运动，不仅目标明确、力量集中，而且声势浩大、规模广阔，一浪接一浪、一浪高一浪地向前发展，猛烈地冲击着一切右倾保守思想，在生产上不断创造出新的纪录，在技术上不断涌现惊人的革新和创造发明，取得了1958年工业生产全面大跃进的伟大胜利，在我国工业发展史上写下了新的光辉的一页。1959年在1958年大跃进的基础上更进一步展开了群众运动，并已经和正在取得继续跃进的成果。这充分证明了集中领导和大搞群众运动这个方针的正确性。
    为什么集中领导必须与大搞群众运动正确的结合起来，才能使工业生产高速度的发展呢？
    群众路线是我们党的基本路线和基本工作方法，无论进行什么工作都必须依靠群众，通过群众。人民群众是历史的创造者，这是马克思主义的一条基本原则。我们党的群众路线就是根据这条原则而提出的。我党三十八年的斗争历史充分证明了这条路线的正确，在民主革命战争中我们坚持了这个路线，壮大了革命力量，取得了革命的胜利。在今天社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中也必须坚持这条路线，才能加速社会主义的发展。在我们社会主义国家里，人民群众是国家的主人，他们已经从根本上改变了被压迫、被剥削者的地位，他们与领导者之间的关系是平等的、同志式的互助合作关系，他们与领导者之间的利益也是一致的，并不存在什么利益的冲突。一切从群众利益出发，一切为了群众，这是我们党的一切工作的目的。我们党在任何时期的方针政策都是群众要求的反映，它是从群众中来，并代表着群众的利益的。正因为党与群众的利益有这样的一致性，所以，我们才能把广大群众组织到各种政治的、经济的和武装的斗争中去，并取得这些斗争的胜利。
    在过去革命斗争中，我们放手发动群众，大搞群众运动；在今天社会主义建设中，我们无例外地也必须放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。工厂企业是工人阶级集中的场所，尤其必须大搞群众运动。只有大搞群众运动，才能充分调动群众的积极性和创造性，达到多快好省建设社会主义的目的。毛主席告诉我们，无论进行什么工作，都要采取领导与群众相结合的办法，在我们社会主义企业里，职工群众既然是企业的主人，我们就应该让他们直接参与企业的管理。不能设想，一个社会主义工厂企业的党的组织以及党和行政的领导人，只坐在办公室里听取汇报，发布命令，或者只依靠少数专家，不依靠群众，不倾听群众意见，不把群众当作企业的主人，发生问题不同群众商量，却能把事情办好的。实践证明：去年我们普遍实行了干部参加体力劳动，种试验田，以普通劳动者的面貌出现，与职工群众同吃、同住、同劳动，遇事与群众商量，并实行了“两参一改三结合”，改善了领导与群众的关系，这些对于鼓舞群众的干劲，充分调动群众的积极性和创造性起了极其重要的作用。1958年所完成的工业总产值超过了解放以来任何一年，是与去年放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，认真贯彻群众路线分不开的。
    我们进行的任何群众运动，都是为一定政治经济目的服务的。我们工厂企业的群众运动也不例外。去年我们大办钢铁的群众运动，就是为了实现以钢为纲带动其他工作全面跃进的目的；今年我们开展的以高产优质为中心的增产节约运动，就是为了更好更全面地完成产量、质量、成本指标的目的；去年和今年我们所展开的技术革命和技术革新运动，就是要通过不断改革工艺过程、改革生产工具和操作方法、改进设备与改进产品设计来达到减少工时、减少物化劳动的消耗、不断提高劳动生产率的目的。
    党的集中领导是党的群众路线的构成部分
    但是，要把绝大多数群众组织到运动中来，向一个目标前进，实现我们预期的目的，只有在党的集中领导之下才有可能。因为，党的集中领导最主要的一个方面是党的方针政策的领导，党在一定时期集中了广大群众的意志、愿望与要求，制定出一套适合群众要求的方针政策，然后把这套方针政策再拿到群众中去贯彻执行。由于党所制定的方针政策是从群众中来的，所以，它就能够充分调动群众的积极性，1957年党中央提出了十五年内在主要产品的产量方面赶上英国的口号，1958年党中央又发出了反浪费反保守的指示，提出了多快好省建设社会主义的总路线，提出了“以钢为纲，全面跃进”和一整套两条腿走路的方针。正因为这一切都是正确的反映了群众要求，因而它们就成为去年我们能够搞起大规模群众运动的原动力。它们就能够打动每个热望改变祖国一穷二白面貌的职工群众的心弦，就能够启发他们无穷无尽的智慧和力量，从而把他们组织起来，形成为轰轰烈烈的群众运动。右倾机会主义分子攻击我们在工业战线上大搞群众运动的方针，特别是攻击大办钢铁的群众运动，把无产阶级和其他劳动人民轰轰烈烈的群众运动，说成是“轰”起来的，仿佛是由于强迫命令，而不是出于群众的自觉，等等，这显然是荒谬的。因为，除了那些把群众当作“阿斗”的反马克思主义者以外，谁都不能设想，如果没有党的集中领导；如果党的总路线和一整套的方针政策并不反映群众的要求；如果群众不是在党的总路线的光辉下，在党的一整套正确的方针、政策的指引下，启发了高度的自觉性，怎么可能形成去年那样大规模的群众运动，又怎么可能得到那样空前的伟大的成绩！因此，这就更可以看出：右倾机会主义分子把党和广大的人民群众在去年大跃进中所表现出来的建设社会主义的热情，诬蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性”，显然是恶毒的攻击。
    党的集中领导的另一方面的问题，是在大搞群众运动中党如何及时而正确地集中群众在运动中所取得的正面的和反面的经验，进行分析、研究，加以总结，转而用以促进运动顺利而健康地深入开展。在大规模的群众运动中，群众一经充分发动起来，就必然会出现许多创造发明，对这些创造发明，需要党及时地把它总结起来加以推广；任何时候在群众中都会有先进、中间、落后三种状态的差别。发动群众，不只是发动先进的，而更重要的是要把落后状态的人也发动起来，才能把运动由少数群众参加的变为绝大多数群众参加的群众运动。去年党在大搞群众运动中采取了抓两头带中间，召开现场会议，组织评比检查，这些就促使先进的更加先进，落后的也能赶上并超过先进，形成了你追我赶的热潮，把运动逐步提高起来。同时，在群众运动的发展过程中，也不可避免地会产生某些缺点，对这些缺点，需要党领导群众及时分析产生缺点的原因，及时加以克服。去年党在大搞群众运动中提出了敢想敢说敢做与实事求是相结合，冲天干劲与科学分析相结合，苦战与休整相结合，抓生产又要抓生活，这一系列的带方针、政策性的问题的提出，正是党及时地总结了去年大搞群众运动中的正面和反面经验所得出的结论。这是党对待群众运动采取的十分正确的态度，这也就完全证明：只有在党的集中领导之下才可能这样及时地正确地总结出群众的经验；也只有在党的集中领导下，才能够把群众的经验用来促进工业生产运动的进一步开展。但是，右倾机会主义分子恰恰相反，他们对待群众运动完全持不同的态度，他们不是积极热情的去支持群众运动，而是站在群众运动旁边指手划脚，他们只注意群众运动中某些局部的暂时性的缺点，并且加以夸大，看不到群众运动中所取得的成绩乃是主要的这个事实；显然，如果按照他们的这种观点去总结经验，那就一定是向群众泼冷水，泄群众的气，阻挠群众运动的深入开展，最后只能是取消群众运动。
    因此，我们可以得出这样的结论：只有集中领导才能有大规模的群众运动。而群众运动愈深入就愈需要加强集中领导。有了集中领导才能统一意志、统一行动，正确贯彻执行党和国家对工业企业所规定的方针政策，没有集中领导的群众运动就会变为盲目自流，而运动也不可能大规模地开展起来。如果放弃了集中领导，那就必然变为群众的尾巴。这是不符合我们大搞群众运动的目的和要求的。
    必须明确：党的集中领导本身是党的群众路线的构成部分，没有党的集中领导，也就谈不到党的群众路线。我们所说的党的集中领导，是建立在广泛发扬民主的基础上的，是有群众基础的，因而，它就能够真正调动起群众的积极性，使他们在生产上充分发挥作用。如果把集中领导同党的群众路线割裂开来，以为强调了党的集中领导，就可以不去倾听群众的意见，不反映群众的要求，而只是用不适合生产发展的一套管理制度和管理办法去限制群众，这是对党的集中领导的一种严重的曲解，这样的集中领导就必然会伤害群众的积极性，使领导脱离群众，使生产的高速度发展成为不可能。因此，集中领导与大搞群众运动必须结合起来，只有结合了起来才能促进生产高速度的发展。
    由此可知，党的集中领导不仅不与大搞群众运动相对立，而且是大搞群众运动所必需，任何企图把党的集中领导与大搞群众运动对立起来的说法，都是完全错误的。
    去年以来，许多同志在这一方面取得了丰富的经验；但也有些同志对两者之间的关系还缺乏正确的理解。他们虽不同于右倾机会主义分子，但他们同样有右倾保守思想，他们对去年在大搞群众运动中暂时打乱了原有的生产秩序，破坏了旧的平衡有意见，对规章制度的改革也有不同看法；对工业生产大搞群众运动有怀疑，对过去单纯依靠行政命令集中管理那一套的管理办法有留恋，总是想回到老路上去。这是不相信群众，否定党的群众路线的错误表现，是我们必须坚决反对的。同时，我们也要反对那种认为集中领导就不能大搞群众运动，要大搞群众运动就不能集中领导的错误说法。前者的错误根源在于不相信群众，后者的根源在于把集中领导当作了限制群众的东西。那种不要群众的集中领导是我们所反对的集中领导，那种认为集中领导就不能大搞群众运动，把集中领导当作是约束群众的东西的看法也是不正确的。我们必须把两者结合起来，才有利于生产的高速度发展。
      需要解决的三个带原则性的问题
    目前在工厂企业里关于集中领导与大搞群众运动的关系上尚有若干带原则性的问题需要解决，解决了这些问题，才有利于大搞群众运动、才有利于生产的继续跃进。
    第一，坚决实行党委领导下的厂长负责制。在工厂企业里，所谓集中领导主要集中于党委的领导，因为党是无产阶级组织的最高形式，党委是党的路线和方针政策的执行者，是工厂企业领导的核心，是群众利益的代表者，也是群众运动的组织者。有了党的集中领导，就可以调动和组织各方面力量去更好地发动与组织群众，贯彻执行党的方针政策。但是，实行党委的集中领导，并不是说无论什么事情都由党委来包办。集中领导必须建立在民主的基础上。必须实行集体领导下的分工负责制。充分发挥工会、共青团的作用，特别是要充分发挥行政的作用。工矿企业的行政工作是由厂长负责的。一切行政事务应该由厂长统一指挥，这样，才不致于使党的领导陷入日常的繁琐事务中去，才有利于加强党的政治思想工作，才能充分发挥党委的领导作用。否则，就会削弱党的领导，造成生产上无人负责的现象。在党委集中统一领导下实行党委与行政的适当分工，这对于搞好生产，充分发动群众都是有利的。
    第二，正确处理企业管理与大搞群众运动的关系。我们社会主义的工厂企业是具有复杂技术的现代化企业，这样的企业像一个大型的交响乐队一样需要有统一的指挥来统一全厂的意志、全厂的行动，以保证生产有秩序地正常进行。为了达到这个目的，在企业管理上就要有集中管理，和与它相适应的一套规章制度、管理方法和组织机构。如何看待这些组织制度，目前存在着两种不同的认识：比如拿规章制度来说，一种把规章制度当成不可改变的东西，单纯地把它当作指挥群众进行生产并管理群众的武器。因而把它看作与大搞群众运动是有矛盾的东西。规章制度与大搞群众运动有没有矛盾？从某种意义说，有矛盾又没有矛盾。我们社会主义工厂企业建立规章制度的目的在于更好更全面地完成生产任务和保证生产有秩序地进行，并有利于群众积极性的发挥。如果我们所建立的规章制度不是凭主观愿望，而是真实地反映了生产过程的客观规律，是群众实践经验的总结，那就不但不会妨碍群众运动的开展，而且是有利于群众积极性的发挥的。这样，规章制度与大搞群众运动就没有矛盾。但是，规章制度不能是一成不变的，必须随着生产的发展，根据群众实践所提出来的要求，加以修正、改变。这就必然出现有破有立。如果某些过时的规章制度该破不破，那就会妨碍群众积极性的发挥，不利于群众运动的开展，就会产生矛盾。去年在大搞群众运动中经过群众的大鸣大放、大字报对规章制度进行了又破又立，对组织机构作了些改变，在多数情况下这些改变是完全必要的，是符合生产和群众的要求的。所以，规章制度与大搞群众运动有矛盾但又是统一的。问题在于企业的领导人要善于及时认识在生产上所发生的新变化，认识当群众在技术上来一次较大的革新的时候，必然对旧的规章制度提出作某些改变的要求。如果坚持不变，过时的规章制度，就会和发展生产和调动群众的积极性发生矛盾。如果作了相应的改变，这种矛盾就可以解决而有利于生产的发展。但另有一种错误的认识，他们把社会主义的规章制度当作是资产阶级的法权，是单纯用来管人的，当作是与群众运动绝对对立的东西，因而主张要大搞群众运动就不能再要什么规章制度。这种对规章制度一概否定的取消观点是十分有害的，如果按照这样的观点行事，必然造成否定集中管理，抛弃统一指挥，造成生产上的混乱，无法更好更全面地完成国家计划。以上这两种把规章制度当作与群众运动对立的认识都是不正确的。实践证明：去年在大搞群众运动中我们对企业的规章制度进行了又破又立，应该肯定许多是破得正确的，促成了去年的大跃进。缺点是有的破得多了一些，有的破得不够恰当。这种现象的产生是大规模群众运动中难以避免的，并不值得大惊小怪。只要一经注意，领导上一抓，是容易克服的。但是，那些具有右倾观点，认为规章制度不可改变的人，却夸大了这些缺点，他们好像理由十分充足似的来否定规章制度改革的必要性，不加分别地要恢复已经破了的规章制度。我们认为对这个问题必须分别对待，破得对的必须肯定，破而未立的应该迅速立起来，不该破而破了的应该迅速恢复起来。这样做，才能既不伤害群众的积极性，又有利于生产的发展。目前在实际工作中最大的危险是不加区别地要恢复一切已破的规章制度。
    第三，把行政管理工作方法与群众路线的工作方法密切结合起来。在工厂企业里，仅仅有正确的方针政策，有合理的规章制度和相适应的组织机构是不够的，还需要有正确的工作方法，才能保证完成与超额完成国家的任务。工作方法有两种：一种是行政管理工作方法。这种管理方法在工厂企业中是不可少的，是非要不可的。有了它就可以较系统地研究工厂情况，制定工厂生产计划，安排生产，组织原材料供应，检验产品质量，保证安全生产，厉行成本核算，以及其他有关生产的许多工作。这样就可以把生产工作安排得更细致、更踏实、更全面。但是，有的同志把这种方法当作唯一的，好像工厂只有依靠这种方法才能搞好生产，因而他们只靠少数人制定计划，安排生产，不愿把计划交给群众讨论，即使交给群众讨论也是走过场。他们这样做的根源是不相信群众，怕计划与群众见面以后会把事情搞“乱”，会增加麻烦。他们习惯于坐办公室发号施令。把行政管理工作方法与群众路线的工作方法对立起来。我们认为社会主义企业不能单纯依靠行政管理方法。单纯依靠这个方法就会脱离实际，脱离群众，应该把行政管理工作方法与群众路线的工作方法结合起来，才能把生产工作建立在群众管理的基础上，才能充分调动群众的积极性，充分挖掘生产潜力，使生产力高速度的发展。行政工作方法与群众路线的工作方法虽然是不同的，但不是不可结合的。而且是很容易结合的，只要企业的领导人有牢固的群众观点，认真相信群众，把生产计划、完成生产计划的困难和有利条件向群众交代清楚，并发动群众讨论，要他们出主意，想办法，提出修订计划，提出措施方案，并在生产过程中不断地依靠群众来解决生产中所发生的重大问题。只要认真地做到这些，行政管理工作方法就自然与群众路线的工作方法结合了起来。这两种方法一经结合，它们在推动生产上就将产生巨大的作用。所以，在工作方法上我们必须两条腿走路。把行政管理工作方法当作唯一的方法对生产是不利的，同样，只有群众路线的工作方法，对行政管理工作方法一概否定也会对生产产生不利影响。这个问题还是今后我们工厂企业必须正确处理的问题。
    党的群众路线，是我们党的生命线。我们在任何工作中，都要贯彻执行党的群众路线。用大搞群众运动的方法来领导工业生产，是党的群众路线在工业战线上的具体运用。我们在过去的十年实践中，已经取得了丰富的经验，今后还将在实际工作中更加充实它的内容。实践证明，那些强调工业特殊认为不能大搞群众运动的想法是完全错误的；那些把党的集中领导同大搞群众运动对立起来的想法和做法，也是完全错误的。右倾机会主义分子对工业战线上大搞群众运动的一切攻击都是不值一驳的。
