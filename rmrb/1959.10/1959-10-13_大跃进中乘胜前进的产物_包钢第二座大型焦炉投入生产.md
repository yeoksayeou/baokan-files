Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 12th: Baotou Steel's second large, automated coke oven—Coke Oven No. 3—was officially put into production on the afternoon of the 12th.

Coke Oven No. 3 and Coke Oven No. 4 are connected together, both being large coke ovens with an annual output of 500,000 tons of coke. After this coke oven is put into production, it will, together with Coke Oven No. 4, supply sufficient metallurgical coke for Baotou Steel's No. 1 large blast furnace. This will play a significant role in ensuring high-quality and high-yield production for Blast Furnace No. 1.

Coke Oven No. 3 is a product of the victorious advance of Baotou Steel's builders during the Great Leap Forward. The completion time of this coke oven was two and a half months ahead of the original plan. From civil engineering to equipment installation, the actual effective construction period was five months, which is one month faster than the construction period of Coke Oven No. 4. After completing Coke Oven No. 4 four months ahead of schedule, the workers of Team 1 of the Furnace Construction Company continued to work hard and skillfully, and completed the masonry of the furnace body of Furnace No. 3 in only thirty-three and a half days. This was three and a half days ahead of Coke Oven No. 4 and one and a half days ahead of the second coke oven of Wuhan Steel, breaking the national record. The top equipment of the coke oven weighed nearly two thousand tons, and the workers of Team 2 of the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company completed it in only fourteen days, shortening the installation period of Blast Furnace No. 4 by more than half. The civil engineering finishing work took only half a month, which was also significantly ahead of Coke Oven No. 4.

　　大跃进中乘胜前进的产物
    包钢第二座大型焦炉投入生产
    据新华社包头12日电　包钢第二座大型自动化焦炉——三号焦炉，已在12日下午正式投入生产。
    三号焦炉和四号焦炉紧连在一起，都是年产焦炭五十万吨的大型焦炉。这座焦炉投入生产后，将和四号焦炉一起，为包钢一号大型高炉供应充足的冶金焦炭。这对保证一号高炉的优质高产将起重大作用。
    三号焦炉是包钢建设者在大跃进中乘胜前进的产物。这座焦炉的建成时间比原计划提前了两个半月。从土建到设备安装，实际有效工期为五个月，比四号焦炉的工期还快一个月。筑炉公司一队工人在提前四个月建成四号焦炉后，继续苦干巧干，只用了三十三天半就完成了三号炉炉体的砌筑工程。比四号焦炉提前了三天半，比武钢第二座焦炉提前了一天半，刷新了全国纪录。焦炉炉顶设备将近二千吨，机电安装公司二队工人仅用十四天就干完了，比四号高炉的安装工期缩短了一半多。土建结尾工程仅用半个月，也比四号焦炉大大提前。
