Starting from "Long Live the Motherland"
Li Ling

Recently, I listened to many newly composed choral works, and personally, I prefer "Long Live the Motherland" (composed by Shi Lemeng). This is not entirely because it depicts the great history of the Chinese revolution over the past century; the issue lies in what kind of musical language it chooses, how it creates musical images, and what techniques it employs.

Choosing a fresh musical language suitable for expressing the subject matter is very important. Being rooted in the music of the masses and folk music does not mean simply imitating mass songs or repeating folk songs. Trite clichés that only seek to be catchy without paying attention to distinctive characteristics are unlikely to achieve better results. Throughout history, most musicians have drawn nourishment from the treasure trove of folk music, and they are good at selecting and digesting these valuable nutrients, creating new and vital things through their own hearts.

Logically, the lyrics of the first movement of "Long Live the Motherland" summarize major revolutionary events of the past sixty or seventy years, briefly mentioning everything from the Opium War to the Xinhai Revolution. This presents many difficulties in dealing with the musical image. The composer's choice to sing it in a large-scale narrative style, rather than setting each sentence or section to music, is a good one. At the same time, the composer selected the tragic, intimate, and characteristic musical language of the Shaanxi folk music style "Wan Wan Qiang" as the keynote to express the people's painful lives under the rule of imperialism and feudal forces, and deepened and developed these tunes, giving them a profound power of resistance to portray the memory of various revolutions. Therefore, although the entire chapter is long, it still sounds relatively intimate, harmonious, and coherent. The section on the Taiping Rebellion is particularly emotionally rich.

The issue of coherence and unity is particularly important in music. When a poet writes lyrics, he can describe this in a small section and portray that in another through words. Although this is not ideal, it is still understandable. But in music, when the tune and rhythm change every four lines or every three lines, it is easy to damage its coherence and unity if this short-term transformation technique is used too much in a piece of music.

Some recent new choral works have not paid enough attention to these issues; in many songs, the music changes with the lyrics. These two lines describe this meaning, and those two lines express another meaning, with too many themes and complicated clues. This not only, as Liu Xie pointed out in the "Melting and Cutting" chapter, "If the technique is not determined in advance, and the heart is entrusted to follow the words, divergent ends will arrive in droves," which easily becomes fragmented and ununified, but also affects the deepening and full expression of the song's emotions. Auditory art is a time art, it flashes by. Unless it is arranged and the contrast is particularly strong, it is difficult to make a deep impression if there are too many changes. I think that if you encounter complex lyrics with many sections of poetry, it is better to concentrate on a few interests and spread it out (repeating the lyrics, lengthening the music), like Xian Xinghai's "Defend the Yellow River," Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," or Handel's "Hallelujah," to sing out the emotions more fully.

The audience especially loves the slow movement "Qinggelanglang's flowing water, Langgeyingying's sky" in the second movement. As soon as the singing appears, it immediately brings people into the artistic conception of the work. The reason why this piece of music has such a strong effect is probably because there are many loud and rapid passages in front of this movement, and the insertion of a lyrical and profound melody in the middle seems particularly fresh and intimate. At the same time, the composer's use of the side recollection of the old herdsman, with emotions and scenery, to carefully tell of his love and respect for the Party and Chairman Mao, is easier to win over than direct praise.

Originally, Comrade Shi Lemeng was good at using beautiful musical language to sculpt various musical images. Even in the most dramatic and majestic songs, such as "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River" with "Ten thousand miles of snow cover the plateau" and "Erlang Mountain," he can handle them well. It is a pity that there are not many such poetic and lyrical arrangements in this choral work, which weakens its expressiveness and contrast.

The atmosphere of victory and the joyful mood of the people in the third movement can be fully felt. Especially the passage after the "Dance," the broad, magnificent, and hymn-like momentum is quite moving. This is mainly because the author has personally experienced countless arduous and great battles and has a firm belief in revolutionary construction, thus expressing such a deep, vigorous, and optimistic voice.

If we make further demands on the third movement of "Long Live the Motherland," I feel that there are still places where the arrangement of the music and the contrast of the emotions can be studied. The composer has put a lot of thought into the arrangement and treatment of this movement. After "Long Live, Long Live," it turns to the "Dance" in three-four time. Its advantages are that it is popular, lively, and smooth. As a mass dance music, it is good to express the joyful and encouraging mood of the vast people in front of Tiananmen Square. But it is still slightly lacking in clarity, and the sentiment is not as novel as the "Pastoral" in the previous movement. And the complete use of chorus, repeated many times (originally the author wanted to use a solo, I believe this would be better), is somewhat long and procrastinating.

Secondly, this dance music itself is relatively warm, joyful, and bright. Although the key is changed and the melody and rhythm have been changed, the contrast before and after is not prominent enough. Instead, it is connected to the magnificent and majestic music behind it, which cannot be regarded as a small weakness. I think that after the recent reorganization, these weaknesses will definitely be overcome.

    从“祖国万岁”谈起
    李凌
    最近听了好些新创作的大合唱曲，从我个人来说，比较喜欢“祖国万岁”（时乐蒙作）。这不完全由于它描写了近百年来中国革命的伟大历史，问题在于它所选取的是什么样的音乐语言，怎样创造音乐形象，和采用怎样的手法。
    选择新鲜的适合表现题材的音乐语言是很重要的。生根于群众音乐和民间音乐之中，并不是群众歌曲的仿制，或民间歌曲的重复，单求顺口，不注意特点特色的陈词滥调，很难获得更好的效果。历来大多数音乐家，都是从民间音乐宝库中吸取滋养，并且是善于选择，和消化这些宝贵的养料，通过自己的心灵，创作出新异的有生命的东西。
    按理说，“祖国万岁”的第一乐章的词意，概括了六七十年的重大革命事件，从鸦片战争起到辛亥革命，都顺序地提了一下，这在音乐形象的处理上会碰到许多困难。作者不去按句按节用音，而把它以大轮廓的叙事体来歌唱是比较好的。同时，作者选取了带悲剧性的，亲切而又有特色的陕西民歌风的碗碗腔的音乐语言作为基调，来表现人民在帝国主义及封建势力统治下的痛苦生活，并且把它深化，发展这些音调，使它具有深沉的抗击力量来刻划对各次革命的怀念，因而全章虽长，听起来还是比较亲切、协调、连贯。其中太平军起义一段，情感特别深厚。
    关于连贯性和统一性问题，在音乐上说来特别重要。诗人作词，通过文字，这一小段描写这个，那一小段刻绘那个，说起来虽然也不够理想，但还是能够了解的，而在音乐中，四句一换，三句一转，音调和节奏就不能不随着发生变化，在一段乐曲中，过多地应用这种短暂转变的手法，就容易损害了它的连贯性和统一性。
    近来有些新作的大合唱，对这些问题注意得不够；好些歌曲，每每随词换歌，这两句写的是这个意思，那两句表现的又是另一个意思，主题过杂，头绪纷繁。这不仅如刘勰在“熔裁”篇中所指出：“若术不素定，而委心逐辞，异端丛至”。容易零碎不统一，而且影响到歌情的深入和充分发挥。听觉艺术是时间艺术，一闪就过去了，除非经过安排，而对比特别强烈，要是变换过多，印象很难深刻。我想，如果碰到词意复杂，诗句的段落又多的情形时，倒不如集中几个意趣，把它铺宽（歌词重复，音乐拉开），像冼星海的“保卫黄河”、贝多芬的“欢乐颂”，或亨德尔的“哈里路亚”那样，把情感唱尽会更好一些。
    听众对第二乐章慢乐段的“青格朗朗的流水哟蓝格英英的天”特别喜爱，歌声一出现，立刻就把人带到作品的意境里面去了。这段音乐之所以有这么强烈的效果，一方面恐怕是在这个乐章的前面，响亮急激的乐段不少，其中插入一节抒情深厚的曲调，显得特别清新亲切，而同时，作者采用老牧人的侧面回忆，有情有景，细致地诉述对党对毛主席的敬爱，要比正面歌颂易于取胜。
    本来时乐蒙同志是善于采用优美的音乐语言来雕刻各种音乐形象的，即使在最急剧雄壮的歌曲中，如“英雄战胜大渡河”中的“万里风雪盖高原”和“二郎山”等，也能处理得很好，可惜在这部大合唱中这样诗情词句的安排不多，而削弱了它的表现力和对比性。
    第三乐章的胜利气息，和人民的欢快的心情，是能够充分地感受到的。特别是“舞曲”后面的乐段，宽阔、壮丽、颂歌的气势磅礴，相当感人。这主要是由于作者亲身经历了无数艰巨伟大的战斗生活，以及对革命建设有着坚定的信心，从而发出如此深厚、雄浑、乐观的心声。
    对于“祖国万岁”的第三乐章，如果再进一步要求的话，我觉得音乐的安排、情调的对比还有可以研究的地方。作曲者对这一乐章的安排和处理是费过心思的，在“万岁，万岁”之后就转入三拍子的“舞曲”，它的优点是通俗，活泼，流畅，作为一首群众性的舞曲，来表现天安门前广大人民的欢腾鼓舞的心情是很好的。但是还略嫌不够鲜明，情趣不如前一乐章的“牧歌”那么新颖。并且完全运用合唱，重复多次（原来作者是想采用领唱，我相信这样会好一些），就有些显得沉长、拖沓。
    其次，这首舞曲本身也是比较热烈、欢腾、明亮的，虽然经过转调，曲调和拍子都作了变化，但前后的对比还不够突出，反而和后面的壮丽、雄伟的音乐连成一片，这不能不算是一个小小的弱点。我想经过了最近的整理，一定会使这些弱点克服过来。
