Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today calling on the Japanese people to fight against the "Security Treaty" and for the abolition of armaments.

The editorial pointed out that in today's world, with the continuous development of the atomic energy industry and the flourishing of rocket technology, there is an increasingly widespread demand to prevent the outbreak of a devastating war in the world. Khrushchev's disarmament proposal is the only way to fundamentally solve this major issue concerning the fate of mankind. The editorial pointed out that this proposal was put forward when the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war, and the socialist camp has an advantage over the imperialist camp.

"Akahata" emphasized that the important thing at present is to unite the forces of peace-loving people around the world and force the imperialists to accept the proposal for complete disarmament. The Japanese people must fight to defend the peaceful constitution and strive for the complete abolition of Japanese armaments.

The editorial pointed out that the Japanese reactionary forces, on the one hand, are subordinate to the United States, and on the other hand, are trampling on the peaceful constitution and gradually rearming. Now, Nobusuke Kishi is still purchasing missiles that can be equipped with nuclear warheads and preparing for nuclear armament. He is also attempting to revise the constitution.

"Akahata" said that Khrushchev's proposal for complete disarmament is consistent with the spirit of the Japanese constitution, and it gives the Japanese people new strength in their struggle against revising the "Security Treaty" and defending the constitution. The Japanese people, who have suffered three times from atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters, must take the lead in expressing their support for Khrushchev's proposal and fight against the "Security Treaty" and for the abolition of all armaments, including nuclear weapons. This is precisely the most correct way to protect Japan's security.

    日共“赤旗报”向日本人民发出号召
    反对日美“安全条约”支持苏联裁军建议
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民为反对“安全条约”和废除军备而斗争。
    社论指出，在原子能事业不断发展、火箭技术正在发达的今天，人们愈来愈广泛地要求防止在世界上爆发毁灭性战争。赫鲁晓夫的裁军建议是从根本上解决关系人类命运的这个重大问题的唯一办法。社论指出，这项建议是在和平力量压倒战争势力、社会主义阵营对帝国主义阵营居于优势地位的时候提出的。
    “赤旗报”强调说，目前重要的是团结全世界爱好和平人民的力量，迫使帝国主义者接受完全废除军备的建议。日本人民要为保卫和平宪法、争取完全废除日本的军备而斗争。
    社论指出：日本反动势力一面从属于美国，一面蹂躏和平宪法，逐渐重整了军备。现在，岸信介还在购买能够安装核弹头的导弹，进行核武装的准备工作。他还在企图修改宪法。
    “赤旗报”说，赫鲁晓夫关于完全废除军备的建议是同日本宪法的精神一致的，它给予日本人民反对修改“安全条约”和维护宪法的斗争以新的力量。曾经三次遭到原子弹和氢弹灾害的日本人民，必需领先表示支持赫鲁晓夫的建议，为反对“安全条约”和废除包括核武器在内的一切军备而斗争。这正是保卫日本的安全的最正确的道路。
