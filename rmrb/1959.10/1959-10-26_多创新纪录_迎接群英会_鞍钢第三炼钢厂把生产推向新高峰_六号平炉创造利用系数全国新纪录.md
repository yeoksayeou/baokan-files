Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 25th: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 Steel Plant, an advanced collective attending the National "Heroes' Conference," have pushed production to new heights in the last three days: increasing the production of high-quality steel by 1,999 tons, fulfilling their guarantee to create high-yield achievements as a gift to the "Heroes' Conference."

During the joint technical performance competition week from the 15th to the 21st, the production level of the No. 3 Steel Plant increased by an average of 26.7% compared to the 1st to the 14th, exceeding the plan by a total of 3,250 tons of steel. Subsequently, all the workers put forward the slogan of consolidating the production results of the technical performance competition week, creating greater production achievements, and offering them as a gift to the "Heroes' Conference." Focusing on shortening the smelting time, a key aspect of production, the workers launched an even larger technical performance upsurge, with everyone from the Party Secretary and Plant Director to the workers participating in the performance. From the 22nd to the 24th, the entire plant exceeded the state steel production plan every day, and on the 23rd, they set a new record of overproducing 1,176 tons of steel.

Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 Steel Plant is a new plant composed of five large fixed open-hearth furnaces that were gradually built in June of last year. Most of the workers are new. However, under the leadership of the Party organization, all the workers carried forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, working hard and cleverly, quickly breaking through the technical barriers, rapidly mastering the operating technology of these large open-hearth furnaces, and rapidly improving the production level. In particular, since the workers created the advanced experience of technical performance competitions in May of this year, they have exceeded the state plan every month, producing a total of more than 35,000 tons of steel more than the state plan from January to September. Due to the excellent results created by the workers of the No. 3 Steel Plant since its opening, they were recently selected by the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel as advanced collective representatives to attend the National "Heroes' Conference."

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 24th: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace have created a new national record for the utilization coefficient of large open-hearth furnaces in the competition to offer gifts to the National "Heroes' Conference." Since October, the average utilization coefficient of this open-hearth furnace has reached 12.74; of which, the average utilization coefficient from the 1st to the 14th reached 13.32.

Due to the increase in the utilization coefficient, this open-hearth furnace has produced 1,006 tons of high-quality steel more than the state plan in the past ten days.

At present, the service life of the roof of this open-hearth furnace has reached 429 heats, and the service life of the front and rear walls has reached 271 heats. These are the latest records for the longevity of furnace bodies of large open-hearth furnaces in the country this year.

Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace has always been outstanding in maintaining the furnace body, becoming a red banner for the comprehensive implementation of the "more charging, faster smelting, high temperature, long life" operating policy for large open-hearth furnaces in the country. Recently, they were rated as an advanced collective to attend the National Heroes' Conference, which gave them great encouragement. The furnace body of the open-hearth furnace is already "old" and should have been repaired long ago. However, all the workers launched a technical performance competition to comprehensively maintain the furnace body, determined to extend the life of the furnace body and produce more steel for the country as a gift to the Heroes' Conference. In the past ten days, veteran workers have taken over the operation of new workers, personally blowing the furnace roof and water jacket to keep the furnace roof clean and the water jacket cross-section normal. Luo Yuandi, the furnace chief of Jia Class, who was rated as a furnace protection expert of Anshan Iron and Steel, leads all the workers of the furnace every day to vigorously strengthen the operation of maintaining the furnace body, and always takes the lead in working hard and rushing to do the hardest and most tiring work. On the 14th, he led all the workers of the furnace to launch an operating performance of rapid steelmaking. Luo Yuandi and his assistant, Wu Changliang, personally demonstrated the operation methods of blowing the water jacket and patching the front wall with a double shovel, making the furnace body maintained quickly and well. On the basis of maintaining the furnace body well, the workers also implemented measures for more charging and faster smelting. As a result, this heat of steel was smelted in only six minutes and fifteen seconds, shortening the time by two minutes and forty seconds compared to the plan, creating a new technology for rapid steelmaking.

Because the workers have always paid attention to furnace body maintenance, not only has the furnace body been healthy and long-lived, but it has also been smelted quickly and in large quantities. From the 1st to the 18th, the average smelting time for each heat of steel was only eight minutes and eleven seconds, shortening the time by forty-four minutes compared to the plan; the average steel production per heat also increased to 234 tons.

Since the beginning of this year, the workers of this open-hearth furnace have learned from the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year and raised furnace body maintenance to a primary position. They said: "Without a furnace, there is no steel. Maintaining the furnace body well creates conditions for more charging and faster smelting." All the workers carried forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work in the operation of maintaining the furnace body, creating a series of new methods for maintaining the furnace body, such as patching the front wall with a double shovel, repairing the furnace at the end of melting, and blowing the water jacket with double pipes, which greatly reduced the furnace repair time, thereby increasing steel production. This open-hearth furnace has exceeded the state plan every month since the beginning of this year, except for April, when the plan was not completed due to the delayed furnace repair; from January to October 18th, a total of 5,159 tons of high-quality steel were overproduced. Now, the goal of the workers is to strive to produce 12,000 tons of high-quality steel more for the country throughout the year. (Attached picture)

    多创新纪录　迎接群英会
    鞍钢第三炼钢厂把生产推向新高峰
    六号平炉创造利用系数全国新纪录
    据新华社鞍山25日电　出席全国“群英会”的先进集体——鞍钢第三炼钢厂的职工们，在最近三天内，又把生产推向新的高峰：增产优质钢一千九百九十九吨，实现了他们提出的创造高产成绩向“群英会”献礼的保证。
    第三炼钢厂在15日到21日的联合技术表演竞赛周里，生产水平比1到14日平均提高26.7％，共比计划超产钢三千二百五十吨。接着，全厂职工又提出了巩固技术表演竞赛周生产成果、创造更大生产成绩，向“群英会”献礼的口号。职工们围绕缩短熔炼时间这一生产关键，掀起了规模更大的技术表演热潮，从党委书记、厂长到工人，都参加了表演。全厂从22日到24日天天超额完成国家产钢计划，并且在23日创造了超产一千一百七十六吨钢的最新纪录。
    鞍钢第三炼钢厂，是由去年6月陆续建成五座大型固定式平炉组成的新厂，工人中大部分是新工人。但是，全厂职工在党组织的领导下，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，苦干巧干，很快就突破了技术关，迅速地掌握了驾驭这种大平炉的操作技术，使生产水平飞速提高。特别是从今年5月全厂职工创造了技术表演竞赛先进经验以来，月月都超额完成国家计划，1至9月份比国家计划共多产钢三万五千多吨。由于第三炼钢厂职工开工以来创造了优异的成绩，不久前被鞍钢职工们推选为出席全国“群英会”的先进集体代表。
    新华社鞍山24日电　鞍钢六号平炉的职工们在向全国“群英会”献礼的竞赛中，创造了全国大型平炉利用系数新纪录。10月份以来，这座平炉的利用系数平均达到了十二点七四；其中1日到14日的平均利用系数，达到了十三点三二。
    由于利用系数的提高，十几天来这座平炉比国家计划多产优质钢一千零六吨。
    目前，这座平炉的炉顶使用寿命已经达到四百二十九次，前后炉墙使用寿命达到二百七十一次。这都是全国大型平炉今年以来炉体长寿的最新纪录。
    鞍钢六号平炉维护炉体一贯很出色，成为全国大型平炉全面贯彻
  “多装、快炼、高温、长寿”操作方针的一面红旗。最近，他们被评为出席全国群英会的先进集体，这给他们很大鼓舞。平炉的炉体已经“年老”，早就应该修炉了。但是，全体职工展开了全面维护炉体的技术表演竞赛，决心要使炉体延长寿命，再为国家炼出更多的钢，向群英会献礼。十几天来，老工人接替新工人的操作，亲自吹炉顶、吹水套，以保持炉顶干净、水套断面正常。被评为鞍钢护炉健将的甲班炉长罗远弟，每天带领全炉职工大力加强维护炉体的操作，而自己总是带头苦干，抢着干最苦最累的活。14日那天，他率领全炉职工展开快速炼钢的操作表演。罗远弟和一助手吴长良，亲自表演吹水套和双铲贴补前墙的操作方法，使炉体维护得又快又好。在维护好炉体的基础上，职工们又实行了多装快炼的措施，结果，这炉钢只用六点十五分钟就炼出来了，比计划缩短二点四十分钟，创造了快速炼钢的新技术。
    由于职工们一贯注意炉体维护，不仅使炉体健康长寿，而且炼得快炼得多。1日到18日，平均每炉钢的熔炼时间只用了八点十一分钟，比计划缩短四十四分钟；平均每炉产钢量也增加到二百三十四吨。
    今年以来，这座平炉的职工吸取了去年大跃进的经验，把炉体维护提高到首要地位。他们说：“没有炉子就没有钢，维护好炉体为多装快炼创造条件。”全体职工在维护炉体操作中发扬了苦干、实干和巧干的精神，创造了双铲贴补前墙、熔化末期补炉、双管吹水套等一系列维护炉体的新方法，使修炉时间大大减少，从而增加了钢产量。这座平炉除了4月份因为修炉延期影响，没有完成计划以外，今年以来，月月都超额完成国家计划；从1月到10月18日，共超产优质钢五千一百五十九吨。现在职工们的奋斗目标是：力争全年为国家多产优质钢一万二千吨。（附图片）
