Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th - The seven state-owned farms in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, have harvested and inspected 8,595 mu of spring wheat, with an average yield exceeding 1,000 jin per mu. The Delingha Farm yielded an average of 1,057 jin per mu on 7,000 mu of spring wheat; the Saishike Farm yielded an average of 1,153.33 jin per mu on 1,279 mu; the Xiangride Farm yielded an average of 1,742 jin per mu on over 133 mu; the Huaitoutala Farm yielded an average of 1,009 jin per mu on 134 mu; the Huaitoukeri Farm yielded an average of 1,022 jin per mu on 36 mu; the Ge'ermu Farm yielded an average of 1,108 jin per mu on 9 mu; and the Mahai Farm yielded an average of 1,128 jin per mu on 4 mu.
    The ability of these seven farms to achieve such high yields is a result of the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line. These farms are generally located in high-altitude areas with relatively cold climates, long freezing periods, short frost-free periods, low rainfall, and high evaporation rates. This year, in order to achieve high yields, cadres and workers, building on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, promoted the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, exerted great effort, strived for the top, and made every effort to boost production. The Delingha Farm summarized its experience by conducting large-scale experimental fields. They conducted experiments on sand culture, soil culture, and hydroponics in fields and outdoors using potted plants. This provided a reliable basis for the management measures of field crops. Regarding fertilizers, this farm achieved more fertilizer, better fertilizer, and skillful fertilizer application. According to the characteristics of low temperatures in alpine regions, they fermented the fertilizer to improve its effectiveness; all organic fertilizers were crushed and processed to ensure even distribution in the soil and maximize their effectiveness; and different fertilizers such as human manure, bone meal, peat, and stable manure were applied in combination. The Xiangride Farm universally deep plowed the fertile fields to a depth of 30 to 60 centimeters and carried out meticulous land preparation. From autumn plowing to the entire field management, fertilizer was applied in appropriate amounts in seven installments, watered seven to nine times, and an average of more than 1,700 jin of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer was applied per mu; the land was cultivated and weeded three times, artificial pollination was assisted four to six times, and efforts were actively made to prevent lodging, prevent diseases and insect pests, etc. Cadres and workers of other farms also did a good job in increasing production measures, thus ensuring the high yield of wheat.

    青海柴达木盆地七个国营农场
    八千多亩春小麦亩产超过千斤
    新华社西宁4日电　青海省柴达木盆地区的七个农场，收打验收的八千五百九十五亩春小麦，平均亩产超过千斤。德令哈农场七千亩春小麦，平均亩产一千零五十七斤；赛什克农场一千二百七十九亩，平均亩产一千一百五十三点三三斤；香日德农场一百三十三亩多，平均亩产一千七百四十二斤；怀头他拉农场一百三十四亩，平均亩产一千零九斤；怀头科日农场三十六亩，平均亩产一千零二十二斤；葛尔穆农场九亩，平均亩产一千一百零八斤；马海农场四亩，平均亩产一千一百二十八斤。
    这七个农场能够获得高额丰产，是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的结果。这些农场所在地，一般地势高，气候比较寒冷，冰冻期长，无霜期短，降雨量少，蒸发量大。今年为了获得高额产量，干部、职工在1958年大跃进的基础上，发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，大鼓干劲，力争上游，千方百计大搞生产。德令哈农场通过大搞试验田，总结经验。他们在田间、室外，用盆栽办法进行了砂培、土培、水培等试验。这样给大田作物的管理措施提供了可靠依据。对于肥料，这个农场作到了多施肥、施好肥、巧施肥。根据高寒地区气温低的特点，他们把肥料加以腐熟，以提高肥效；对所有的有机肥料，都进行了粉碎加工，使之在土壤里分布均匀，充分发挥效能；对人粪尿、骨粉、泥炭、厩肥等不同肥料配合施用。香日德农场丰产田普遍深翻三十至六十厘米，同时进行精细整地。从秋翻到整个田间管理，分期适量施肥七次，浇水七至九次，每亩平均施氮磷钾肥一千七百多斤；中耕除草三次，人工辅助授粉四至六次，并积极防倒伏，防病虫害等。其他各农场干部、职工，在增产措施上也抓得很好，因而，保证了小麦的高额丰产。
