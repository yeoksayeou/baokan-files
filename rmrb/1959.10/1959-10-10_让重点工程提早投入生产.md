    Let Key Projects into Production Early
    The Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy clearly defines the tasks of the capital construction sector at present. That is: "The capital construction front must concentrate its efforts to ensure important projects, especially those that need to be put into production this year, accelerate construction progress, and quickly realize the effect of investment." Now, the broad masses of workers and staff on the capital construction front are launching a vigorous mass movement with a new fighting posture, striving to put key projects into production early and to complete this year's capital construction plan ahead of schedule.
    This year, the national plan is to complete capital construction projects with an investment of 24.8 billion yuan, which is more than 3 billion yuan more than the national budget investment completed in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Most of the 788 above-quota basic construction projects planned for construction will be fully or partially completed and put into production this year. The production capacity of iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling will increase by several million tons, coal mining capacity will increase by tens of millions of tons, and the production capacity of other industrial sectors will also increase significantly. This is a grand plan for continued Great Leap Forward. The completion of this capital construction plan will not only play an important role in completing this year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, but also have a more significant impact on development in the coming years.
    In the first eight months of this year, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the workers and staff on the national capital construction front achieved brilliant victories on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. From January to August, the completed capital construction investment nationwide increased by 19% compared with the same period last year, and was even more than the total investment for the entire year of 1957. Never before has there been such a large investment scale. A large number of projects were put into production, significantly increasing the national industrial production capacity. In terms of the average monthly increase in production capacity, the newly added production capacity of 19 major products from January to August this year far exceeded the level during the First Five-Year Plan period. The newly added production capacity of coking, iron smelting, natural petroleum, and synthetic petroleum in eight months even exceeded the cumulative increase in capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period. In terms of water conservancy construction, the investment completed from January to August also increased by 76.9% compared with the same period last year. After the promulgation of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a new and greater production upsurge emerged on the capital construction front. In September, the completed capital construction investment nationwide increased sharply by 54% compared with August; the number of above-quota projects completed and partially completed and put into production has increased from more than 180 in the first eight months to more than 230. In September alone, the newly added production capacity of steelmaking, iron smelting, sulfuric acid, power generation, coal mining, and machine-made paper was equivalent to more than half of the cumulative amount from January to August; the newly added production capacity of coal washing and cement in September even exceeded the total newly added production capacity from January to August. Since the beginning of this year, the quality of most projects has improved, and project costs have also been reduced. This brilliant development and thriving atmosphere of capital construction in our country has powerfully refuted the shameless slander of foreign reactionaries against our Great Leap Forward, and has also powerfully refuted the absurd remarks of right-leaning opportunists attempting to negate the Great Leap Forward and high speed.
    Our current task is to take advantage of this excellent situation, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and in the last two months of this year, further accelerate construction progress, improve quality, and ensure that key projects are put into production as soon as possible. Putting key projects into production early can quickly realize the effect of investment, expand industrial production capacity, better complete this year's national economic plan, and free up resources to prepare for next year's capital construction, ensuring a high-speed leap forward as soon as construction begins next year.
    How can we accelerate construction speed and ensure that important projects, especially those that need to be put into production this year, are put into production early?
    The fundamental guarantee for accelerating construction progress and completing this year's capital construction plan ahead of schedule is to adhere to putting politics in command, overcome right-leaning thinking, boost morale, and deeply develop the mass movement of vigorously increasing production and practicing economy. This has been fully confirmed by the practice of the Great Leap Forward last year and this year. However, some cadres have also underestimated the achievements made since the Great Leap Forward and the favorable conditions in this year's work, and have exaggerated some temporary difficulties, resulting in right-leaning emotions and right-leaning thinking such as slackening and fearing difficulties. Instead of actively supporting and leading the great mass movement, they adopted a bourgeois master-like attitude, standing by and commenting, pouring cold water on the masses and discouraging them. This is completely wrong. The documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are a powerful weapon for smashing right-leaning thinking and the "soft bone disease" in dealing with difficulties. Basic construction departments in various regions should firmly grasp this weapon, conduct in-depth education among all cadres and workers, recognize the situation, clarify the direction, further boost morale, and deeply develop a vigorous mass movement of vigorously increasing production and practicing economy. A finishing project of the Beijing Steel Plant construction site under the Sixth Construction Engineering Company of Beijing originally planned to be completed by September 15, and many cadres felt unsure; after opposing right-leaning and slackening emotions and launching a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the remaining projects were completed on August 20, except for the oil felt which could not be laid due to continuous rain at the time. This is one of countless examples, proving that the Party's policy of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale at the Eighth Plenary Session is a completely correct policy to ensure accelerated construction speed on the capital construction front.
    The methods of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results that have been proven effective since the Great Leap Forward must be adhered to and vigorously promoted, and further developed in this year's practice. In order to accelerate construction speed, it is necessary to adhere to rationally arranging engineering projects, concentrating superior forces, and fighting annihilation battles in batches and phases. The practice of "blooming everywhere" and "dividing forces to guard the passes" will disperse manpower and material resources, and seeking speed will actually make it slower. On the premise of ensuring key points, taking the method of phased assaults, completing one batch and then assaulting another, can accelerate the construction progress. Finishing works should be given special attention. The experience of Beijing in carrying out finishing works can be used as a reference for various places. Their approach is: from the city to the construction site, establish joint headquarters for finishing and completion at all levels. The design, construction, and construction departments and the units undertaking the manufacture of equipment work together under centralized leadership; tap the internal potential of construction and construction units and strengthen the supply of materials and equipment; mobilize the masses to formulate construction plans for phased, batch-by-batch, and item-by-item assaults on finishing works based on the specific conditions of the finishing works; organize rapid construction, quick battles, and quick decisions on the premise of ensuring quality; leading cadres of construction and construction departments personally go into battle, specifically directing production, grasping inspections, and promptly solving problems when problems are found. Here, the employees of construction enterprises must clearly establish the idea of serving production. The amount of tasks completed should not only depend on the amount of work, but also on the amount of physical work, and whether it is put into production on time. If we only look at the size of the output value and workload, and drag out the completion time of the finishing works for a long time after the main project is completed quickly, this will affect the speed of national construction and cannot quickly realize the effect of investment. This situation should be avoided.
    In order to ensure that key projects are put into production as early as possible, we must currently firmly grasp the progress of the project, vigorously carry out technical innovation activities, and improve labor productivity, especially to grasp the delivery plans for each ten-day period and each month, and ensure that the project progress is completed on a ten-day and monthly basis. While grasping progress, we must implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in every capital construction project, and comprehensively achieve high output, high quality, safety, and low cost. All units need to continue to educate employees to establish an overall perspective that values both quantity and quality; conscientiously implement the construction procedures and regulations necessary to ensure greater, faster, better, and more economical construction. The employees of the capital construction department should make great ambitions and strive to ensure that every project completed in the last two months of this year is of excellent quality. The capital construction department should regard vigorously practicing economy as an important measure to ensure the completion of this year's plan. All units should strive to save more materials on the premise of ensuring quality for more projects, so as to better complete this year's construction plan, and at the same time, prepare better material conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward of capital construction in the first quarter of next year. Countless facts have proved that doing a good job in quality, economy, and safety can better accelerate the progress of the project and ensure the high-speed development of capital construction.
    To accelerate the progress of the project, timely supply of complete sets of equipment is an important key. The staff and workers of the national machinery industry department are seizing the time to rush out the equipment needed this year in a timely manner. Various localities and central ministries should also do a good job in the unified adjustment of equipment and materials in order to solve the problem that the delivery time of equipment and materials and the variety specifications of materials for certain projects may not fully meet the construction requirements.
    In order to ensure that key projects are put into production in a timely manner, all localities should seize the construction of relevant collaborative projects. The progress of water supply, power supply, gas supply, and transportation projects must be coordinated with the progress of major projects. Since a large number of construction projects will be transferred to production in the next two months, all localities and departments should now seize the preparation work for production. The supply of raw materials, the allocation of technical forces, the preparation of tooling and gauges, and the learning of process drawings must be rushed ahead, so that the newly completed projects can quickly play a role.
    We firmly believe that under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, through the efforts of all staff and workers of the capital construction department and the cooperation of all relevant departments, the various important projects to be completed this year can be completed and put into production on time or ahead of schedule, and the annual capital construction plan will be successfully overfulfilled!

    让重点工程提早投入生产
    党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议中，对于当前基本建设部门的任务作了明确的指示。这就是：“基本建设战线必须集中力量，保证重要项目，首先是今年需要投入生产的项目，加快建设进度，迅速发挥投资效果。”现在，基本建设战线上的广大职工，正在以新的战斗姿态，掀起轰轰烈烈的群众运动，力争重点工程提早投入生产，和提前完成今年的基本建设计划。
    今年全国计划完成投资额二百四十八亿元的基本建设工程，比大跃进的1958年完成的国家预算内投资多三十余亿元。计划施工的七百八十八个限额以上的基本建设项目，大部分要在今年内全部或部分建成投入生产。炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等生产能力，都将增长几百万吨，煤炭开采能力将增长几千万吨，其他工业部门的生产能力，也将有很大的增长。这是一个宏伟的继续大跃进的计划。这个基本建设计划的完成，不但对于提前和超额完成今年的生产计划有重要作用，而且特别是对于明年和后年的发展有着更加重大的影响。
    今年前八个月，全国基本建设战线的职工在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在去年大跃进的基础上，取得了辉煌的胜利。1至8月份，全国完成的基本建设投资额，比去年同期增长19％，比1957年全年的投资额还多，历年来都没有过这么大的投资规模。大批工程投入生产，使全国工业生产能力显著提高。按每月平均增加的生产能力来看，今年1至8月份有十九种主要产品大大超过了第一个五年计划期间的水平。炼焦、炼铁、天然石油、人造石油等八个月新增生产能力，还超过了第一个五年计划期间累计增加的能力。在水利建设方面，1至8月份完成的投资额，也比去年同期增长76.9％。党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，基本建设战线上出现了新的更大的生产高潮。9月份，全国完成的基本建设投资额比8月份猛增54％；全部和部分建成投入生产的限额以上的工程项目，已经由前八个月的一百八十多个，增加到二百三十多个。9月一个月，炼钢、炼铁、硫酸、发电、煤炭开采、机制纸等新增加的生产能力，相当于1至8月份累计数的一半以上；洗煤、水泥9月份新增加的生产能力，还超过了1至8月份新增加的生产能力的总和。今年以来，绝大部分工程的质量都提高了，工程成本也有所降低。我国基本建设的这种辉煌的发展和欣欣向荣的气象，有力地回击了外国反动派对我国大跃进的无耻污蔑，也有力地驳斥了右倾机会主义分子企图否定大跃进、高速度的谰言。
    我们当前的任务是要趁着这一大好的形势，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，在今年最后的两个多月中，更加加快建设进度，提高质量，保证重点工程早日投入生产。重点工程提早投入生产，既可以迅速发挥投资效果，扩大工业生产能力，更好地完成今年的国民经济计划，又可以腾出力量，为明年基本建设作好准备，保证明年一开工就能高速度跃进。
    怎样才能加快建设速度，保证重要工程项目特别是今年需要投入生产的项目提早投入生产呢？
    加快施工进度，提前完成今年基本建设计划的根本保证，是坚持政治挂帅，克服右倾思想，鼓足干劲，深入开展厉行增产节约的群众运动。这是去年和今年的大跃进的实践完全证实了的。但是，也有少数干部曾经对大跃进以来取得的成就和今年工作中的有利条件估计不足，过分夸大了某些暂时性的困难，产生了松劲、畏难等右倾情绪和右倾思想。他们对伟大的群众运动不是积极支持和领导，而是采取了资产阶级的老爷式的态度，站在旁边评头品足，给群众泼冷水，泄群众的气。这是完全错误的。党的八届八中全会的文件是粉碎右倾思想和对待困难的“软骨病”的有力武器。各地基本建设部门应该紧紧掌握这一武器，在全体干部、工人中进行深入的教育，认清形势，明确方向，进一步鼓足干劲，深入开展轰轰烈烈的厉行增产节约的群众运动。北京市第六建筑工程公司所属北京钢厂工地的一项收尾工程，原来计划到9月15日完工，许多干部还认为没有把握；经过反对右倾松劲情绪，掀起增产节约运动的新高潮，结果除油毡因当时连日下雨不能铺以外，其余工程已在8月20日完成了。这是无数的例子中的一个，证明党的八中全会反右倾鼓干劲的方针是在基本建设战线上保证加快建设速度的完全正确的方针。
    大跃进以来证明行之有效的多快好省的办法，必须坚持实行和大力推广，并在今年的实践中进一步发展。为了加快建设速度，必须坚持对工程项目进行合理的排队，集中优势力量，分批分期打歼灭战。“全面开花”、“分兵把口”的作法，会分散人力、物力，求快反而快不了。在保证重点的前提下，采取分批突击的办法，完成一批再突击一批，才能加快施工进度。收尾工程尤其要抓紧。北京市突击收尾工程的经验可供各地参考。他们的作法是：从市到工地成立各级收尾竣工联合指挥部，设计、施工、建设部门和承担制造设备的单位在集中领导下，同心协力，共同作战；挖掘施工和建设单位的内部潜力，加强材料和设备的供应工作；发动群众根据收尾工程的具体条件，制定分期、分批、分项目突击收尾的施工计划；在保证质量的前提下，组织快速施工，速战速决；建设部门和施工部门的领导干部亲自上阵，具体指挥生产，抓紧检查，发现问题及时解决。在这里，建筑企业的职工要明确树立为生产服务的思想。完成任务多少，不能光看工作量，还要看实物工程量，看是不是按时投入生产。如果只看产值、工作量的大小，在迅速完成主体工程以后，把收尾工程完工时间拖得很长，这会影响国家建设速度，不能迅速发挥投资效果。这种情况应当避免。
    为了保证重点工程尽早投入生产，当前要狠狠地抓紧工程进度，大搞技术革新运动，提高劳动生产率，特别要抓分旬、分月的交工计划，保证按旬、按月完成工程进度。在抓进度的同时，要在每一项基本建设工程中贯彻执行多快好省的方针，全面实现高产、优质、安全、低成本。各单位需要继续教育职工树立数量、质量并重的全面观点；认真贯彻执行保证多快好省地进行建设所必需的施工程序和规章制度。基本建设部门的职工应该立下雄图大志，力争今年最后两个多月完成的工程项项质量优良。基本建设部门应该把厉行节约当作保证完成今年计划的一项重要措施。各单位应该在保证质量的前提下，力争多节约一些材料用于更多的工程，以便更好地完成今年的建设计划，同时，也为明年第一季度基本建设继续大跃进准备更好的物质条件。无数事实都证明，作好了优质、节约、安全工作，就能更好地加快工程进度，保证基本建设高速度发展。
    要加快工程进度，及时供应成套设备是一个重要关键。全国机械工业部门的职工正在抓紧时间，把今年需要的设备及时成套地赶制出来。各地和中央各部还要作好设备、材料的统一调剂工作，以便解决某些工程项目在设备、材料的交付时间和材料的品种规格等方面可能不完全适应施工要求的问题。
    为了保证重点工程及时投入生产，各地应抓紧有关协作配合工程的建设。供水、供电、供气和交通运输等工程的进度，必须和主要工程的进度相配合。由于今后两个多月将有大批建设项目移交生产，各地、各部门现在应抓紧作好生产准备工作。原材料的供应、技术力量的调配、工卡量具的准备、工艺图纸的学习等，必须赶在前面，以便新建成的工程迅速发挥作用。
    我们深信，在党的八届八中全会伟大号召下，经过基本建设部门全体职工的努力和各有关部门的协作，今年要完工的各项重要工程一定可以按时或提前建成投入生产，全年的基本建设计划一定能够圆满地超额地胜利完成！
