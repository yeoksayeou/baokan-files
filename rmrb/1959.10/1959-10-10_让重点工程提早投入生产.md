    Let Key Projects into Production Early
    The Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy clearly defines the tasks of the capital construction sector at present. That is: "The capital construction front must concentrate its efforts to ensure important projects, especially those that need to be put into production this year, accelerate construction progress, and quickly realize the effect of investment." Now, the broad masses of workers and staff on the capital construction front are launching a vigorous mass movement with a new fighting posture, striving to put key projects into production early and to complete this year's capital construction plan ahead of schedule.
    This year, the national plan is to complete capital construction projects with an investment of 24.8 billion yuan, which is more than 3 billion yuan more than the national budget investment completed in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Most of the 788 above-quota basic construction projects planned for construction will be fully or partially completed and put into production this year. The production capacity of iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling will increase by several million tons, coal mining capacity will increase by tens of millions of tons, and the production capacity of other industrial sectors will also increase significantly. This is a grand plan for continued Great Leap Forward. The completion of this capital construction plan will not only play an important role in completing this year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, but also have a more significant impact on development in the coming years.
    In the first eight months of this year, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the workers and staff on the national capital construction front achieved brilliant victories on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. From January to August, the completed capital construction investment nationwide increased by 19% compared with the same period last year, and was even more than the total investment for the entire year of 1957. Never before has there been such a large investment scale. A large number of projects were put into production, significantly increasing the national industrial production capacity. In terms of the average monthly increase in production capacity, the newly added production capacity of 19 major products from January to August this year far exceeded the level during the First Five-Year Plan period. The newly added production capacity of coking, iron smelting, natural petroleum, and synthetic petroleum in eight months even exceeded the cumulative increase in capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period. In terms of water conservancy construction, the investment completed from January to August also increased by 76.9% compared with the same period last year. After the promulgation of the Communiqu√© and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a new and greater production upsurge emerged on the capital construction front. In September, the completed capital construction investment nationwide increased sharply by 54% compared with August; the number of above-quota projects completed and partially completed and put into production has increased from more than 180 in the first eight months to more than 230. In September alone, the newly added production capacity of steelmaking, iron smelting, sulfuric acid, power generation, coal mining, and machine-made paper was equivalent to more than half of the cumulative amount from January to August; the newly added production capacity of coal washing and cement in September even exceeded the total newly added production capacity from January to August. Since the beginning of this year, the quality of most projects has improved, and project costs have also been reduced. This brilliant development and thriving atmosphere of capital construction in our country has powerfully refuted the shameless slander of foreign reactionaries against our Great Leap Forward, and has also powerfully refuted the absurd remarks of right-leaning opportunists attempting to negate the Great Leap Forward and high speed.
    Our current task is to take advantage of this excellent situation, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and in the last two months of this year, further accelerate construction progress, improve quality, and ensure that key projects are put into production as soon as possible. Putting key projects into production early can quickly realize the effect of investment, expand industrial production capacity, better complete this year's national economic plan, and free up resources to prepare for next year's capital construction, ensuring a high-speed leap forward as soon as construction begins next year.
    How can we accelerate construction speed and ensure that important projects, especially those that need to be put into production this year, are put into production early?
    The fundamental guarantee for accelerating construction progress and completing this year's capital construction plan ahead of schedule is to adhere to putting politics in command, overcome right-leaning thinking, boost morale, and deeply develop the mass movement of vigorously increasing production and practicing economy. This has been fully confirmed by the practice of the Great Leap Forward last year and this year. However, some cadres have also underestimated the achievements made since the Great Leap Forward and the favorable conditions in this year's work, and have exaggerated some temporary difficulties, resulting in right-leaning emotions and right-leaning thinking such as slackening and fearing difficulties. Instead of actively supporting and leading the great mass movement, they adopted a bourgeois master-like attitude, standing by and commenting, pouring cold water on the masses and discouraging them. This is completely wrong. The documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are a powerful weapon for smashing right-leaning thinking and the "soft bone disease" in dealing with difficulties. Basic construction departments in various regions should firmly grasp this weapon, conduct in-depth education among all cadres and workers, recognize the situation, clarify the direction, further boost morale, and deeply develop a vigorous mass movement of vigorously increasing production and practicing economy. A finishing project of the Beijing Steel Plant construction site under the Sixth Construction Engineering Company of Beijing originally planned to be completed by September 15, and many cadres felt unsure; after opposing right-leaning and slackening emotions and launching a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the remaining projects were completed on August 20, except for the oil felt which could not be laid due to continuous rain at the time. This is one of countless examples, proving that the Party's policy of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale at the Eighth Plenary Session is a completely correct policy to ensure accelerated construction speed on the capital construction front.
    The methods of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results that have been proven effective since the Great Leap Forward must be adhered to and vigorously promoted, and further developed in this year's practice. In order to accelerate construction speed, it is necessary to adhere to rationally arranging engineering projects, concentrating superior forces, and fighting annihilation battles in batches and phases. The practice of "blooming everywhere" and "dividing forces to guard the passes" will disperse manpower and material resources, and seeking speed will actually make it slower. On the premise of ensuring key points, taking the method of phased assaults, completing one batch and then assaulting another, can accelerate the construction progress. Finishing works should be given special attention. The experience of Beijing in carrying out finishing works can be used as a reference for various places. Their approach is: from the city to the construction site, establish joint headquarters for finishing and completion at all levels. The design, construction, and construction departments and the units undertaking the manufacture of equipment work together under centralized leadership; tap the internal potential of construction and construction units and strengthen the supply of materials and equipment; mobilize the masses to formulate construction plans for phased, batch-by-batch, and item-by-item assaults on finishing works based on the specific conditions of the finishing works; organize rapid construction, quick battles, and quick decisions on the premise of ensuring quality; leading cadres of construction and construction departments personally go into battle, specifically directing production, grasping inspections, and promptly solving problems when problems are found. Here, the employees of construction enterprises must clearly establish the idea of serving production. The amount of tasks completed should not only depend on the amount of work, but also on the amount of physical work, and whether it is put into production on time. If we only look at the size of the output value and workload, and drag out the completion time of the finishing works for a long time after the main project is completed quickly, this will affect the speed of national construction and cannot quickly realize the effect of investment. This situation should be avoided.
    In order to ensure that key projects are put into production as early as possible, we must currently firmly grasp the progress of the project, vigorously carry out technical innovation activities, and improve labor productivity, especially to grasp the delivery plans for each ten-day period and each month, and ensure that the project progress is completed on a ten-day and monthly basis. While grasping progress, we must implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in every capital construction project, and comprehensively achieve high output, high quality, safety, and low cost. All units need to continue to educate employees to establish an overall perspective that values both quantity and quality; conscientiously implement the construction procedures and regulations necessary to ensure greater, faster, better, and more economical construction. The employees of the capital construction department should make great ambitions and strive to ensure that every project completed in the last two months of this year is of excellent quality. The capital construction department should regard vigorously practicing economy as an important measure to ensure the completion of this year's plan. All units should strive to save more materials on the premise of ensuring quality for more projects, so as to better complete this year's construction plan, and at the same time, prepare better material conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward of capital construction in the first quarter of next year. Countless facts have proved that doing a good job in quality, economy, and safety can better accelerate the progress of the project and ensure the high-speed development of capital construction.
    To accelerate the progress of the project, timely supply of complete sets of equipment is an important key. The staff and workers of the national machinery industry department are seizing the time to rush out the equipment needed this year in a timely manner. Various localities and central ministries should also do a good job in the unified adjustment of equipment and materials in order to solve the problem that the delivery time of equipment and materials and the variety specifications of materials for certain projects may not fully meet the construction requirements.
    In order to ensure that key projects are put into production in a timely manner, all localities should seize the construction of relevant collaborative projects. The progress of water supply, power supply, gas supply, and transportation projects must be coordinated with the progress of major projects. Since a large number of construction projects will be transferred to production in the next two months, all localities and departments should now seize the preparation work for production. The supply of raw materials, the allocation of technical forces, the preparation of tooling and gauges, and the learning of process drawings must be rushed ahead, so that the newly completed projects can quickly play a role.
    We firmly believe that under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, through the efforts of all staff and workers of the capital construction department and the cooperation of all relevant departments, the various important projects to be completed this year can be completed and put into production on time or ahead of schedule, and the annual capital construction plan will be successfully overfulfilled!
