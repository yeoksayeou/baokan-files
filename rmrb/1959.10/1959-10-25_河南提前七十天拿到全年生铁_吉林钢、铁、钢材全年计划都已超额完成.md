Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 23rd Dispatch: Heartening news from the iron and steel industry front in Henan Province: as of the 21st, the province's annual pig iron production plan has been completed, exceeding the target by 0.35% a full seventy days ahead of schedule.

Henan's early completion of this year's pig iron production plan is a victory for the Party's policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs. At the beginning of this year, in accordance with the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on rectifying the iron and steel industry, a rational layout and rectification and improvement work was carried out on the small-scale indigenous production ironmaking bases that developed during the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking last year, thereby establishing a number of small-scale foreign-method production blast furnaces in a planned way, building the medium-sized Anyang Iron and Steel Company, and constructing a large number of mines, simple coking furnaces, and earthen railways, so that various steel plants initially possessed a production system from mining and coking to smelting. At the same time, a series of technical transformations were carried out on some small-scale indigenous production ironmaking furnaces with better production conditions but could not be rebuilt and expanded for the time being, reaching the requirements of indigenous furnaces with foreign equipment, thereby increasing output and improving quality.

Now, the iron and steel industry workers of the province are advancing victoriously, striving to realize this year's production increase and economy plan, and making preparations for continued great leaps forward next year, especially in the first quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 24th Dispatch: Jilin Province's iron and steel industry has completed the state-stipulated annual production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. As of the 18th, pig iron and steel exceeded the plan by 0.54% and 0.22% respectively; steel production had already been completed ahead of schedule on August 31st.

Since September last year, Jilin Province has implemented the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, launching a vigorous mass movement to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry. In just a few months, dozens of "small indigenous groups" of ironmaking, steelmaking, coking, mining, and small coal mines, mainly using indigenous methods, were established, and a fairly strong iron and steel technical team was trained, thus ending the history of Jilin Province not producing an inch of iron. On this basis, after reasonable layout and technical transformation at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the province has initially formed an iron and steel industry system including medium and small-sized foreign-method production enterprises for ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, mining, coal mining, coal washing, and coking, owning nineteen ironmaking plants or workshops, seventeen steelmaking points, nine steel rolling units, and affiliated fuel and raw material departments.

At present, the iron and steel industry workers of the province are taking advantage of the victory to make a decisive battle in the fourth quarter, and while ensuring that output increases steadily month by month, they will actively improve equipment, improve technology, and do a good job in cold protection and heat preservation, so as to prepare for continuing to give play to the potential of medium and small-sized enterprises and achieving a great leap forward next year.

### 河南提前七十天拿到全年生铁  吉林钢、铁、钢材全年计划都已超额完成

    河南提前七十天拿到全年生铁
    吉林钢、铁、钢材全年计划都已超额完成
    据新华社郑州23日电　河南省钢铁工业战线传出振奋人心的捷报：到21日止，全省全年的生铁产量计划已经提前超产0.35％完成了。
    河南省提前完成今年的生铁生产计划，是党的土洋结合、两条腿走路方针的胜利。在今年年初，各地根据中共河南省委整顿钢铁工业的指示，对去年在大炼钢铁运动中发展起来的小型土法生产的炼铁基点进行了合理的定点布局和整顿提高工作，从而有计划地建立了一批小型洋法生产的高炉，建设了中型安阳钢铁公司，还建设了大批的矿山、简易炼焦炉和土铁路，使各个钢铁厂初步具备了从采矿、炼焦到冶炼的生产体系。与此同时，对于一部分生产条件较好但一时还不能改建和扩建的小型土法生产的炼铁炉，也进行了一系列的技术改造，达到了土炉子洋设备的要求，从而增加了产量，提高了质量。
    现在，全省钢铁工业职工正乘胜前进，努力实现今年的增产节约计划，并且为明年特别是第一季度的继续大跃进作好准备。
    据新华社长春24日电　吉林省钢铁工业提前超额完成国家规定的全年生产计划。到18日，生铁和钢分别超过计划0.54％和0.22％；钢材生产在8月31日已经提前完成。
    去年9月以后，吉林省贯彻党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，掀起轰轰烈烈的大办钢铁的群众运动。仅仅几个月，就建立起几十个以土法生产为主的“小土群”炼铁点、炼钢点、炼焦点、采矿点和小煤窑，并锻炼出一支相当强大的钢铁技术队伍，从而结束了吉林省不产寸铁的历史。在这个基础上，全省在去年年底今年年初经过合理定点和技术改造已经初步形成包括炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、采矿、采煤、洗煤、炼焦等中小型洋法生产企业的钢铁工业体系，拥有十九个炼铁厂或车间、十七个炼钢点、九个轧钢单位，以及附属的燃料原料部门。
    目前全省钢铁工业职工正乘胜决战第四季度，要在保证产量逐月稳步上升的同时，积极改进设备，提高技术，做好防寒保温等项工作，为明年继续发挥中小型企业的潜力，实现大跃进作好准备。
