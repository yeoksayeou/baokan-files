    A Basket of Rice
    After breakfast, Team Leader Zhang of the Yingzigang Production Team of the Dingji Commune in Liu'an County, Anhui, was preparing to clean up the warehouse to welcome the new rice into storage. As soon as he opened the warehouse door, he saw a large basket of golden rice inside, which felt damp to the touch. He thought: the rice was only threshed yesterday and is still piled up on the threshing ground, where did this basket of rice come from? He ran to the neighboring canteen to ask, but the commune members all said they didn't know. Just as everyone was guessing, the feeder, Wang Xueru, came back from herding the cattle and explained the whole thing:
    Last night, warehouse keeper, old man Xie Jiaguo, was coming back from watering the fields at the Fourth Production Team. He was walking barefoot across the threshing ground when he felt something prick his foot. He bent down and touched it, and couldn't help but exclaim, "Rice! Rice!" He thought that it must have been scattered when they were "splashing the field" with water this afternoon. If he waited until the ground dried tomorrow to pick it up, he wouldn't be able to find it. So he squatted down to pick it up, but it was too dark to see clearly. He calculated the date and muttered to himself: "The twentieth day, the moon rises in the first watch. I'll come back later."
    The moon came out, and old man Xie Jiaguo took a rice basket from home, squatted on the threshing ground, and carefully picked up the grains scattered in the mud. After picking it up, he put the rice in the pond to wash away the mud, sent it to the warehouse, and then went back to rest, preparing to move the basket of rice to the threshing ground to dry the next morning.
    After little Wang explained the situation clearly, he said with a smile, "Now that old Xie is not at home, I'll go move the rice out to dry." With that, he ran out.

    一箩稻
    吃过早饭，安徽六安县丁集公社郢子岗生产队张队长准备把仓库收拾干净，迎接新稻入库。刚打开仓库门一看，里面放着一大箩黄橙橙的稻子，用手一摸还潮漉漉的。他想：稻子昨天才脱粒，还在场地上堆着，这一箩稻是从哪里来的呢？跑到隔壁食堂一问，社员们都说不知道。大家正在猜测的时候，饲养员王学如放牛回来才把这件事讲个明白：
    昨晚，保管员谢家国老汉从第四生产队车水回来，赤着脚走过稻场，觉着有什么东西在底下扎脚，他弯身一摸，不觉惊叫道：“稻子！稻子！”他想这一定是下午“雨泼场”时撒掉的，如果明天地干了再拾，就会拣不起来。于是他蹲在地上去拾，但是天黑看不清楚，他一计算日子，嘴里叽咕了一句：“二十轮登，月上一更。等一会再来吧。”
    月亮出来了，谢家国老汉从家里拿着一只稻箩，蹲在稻场上，仔细地拣着撒在泥水里的谷粒。拣完后，又把稻子放在塘里淘去了泥土，送到仓库里，然后才回去休息，准备第二天一早，再把这箩稻搬到场上晒干。
    小王把情况介绍清楚后，笑着说：“现在老谢不在家，我去把稻子搬出来晒晒罢。”说着就跑出去了。
