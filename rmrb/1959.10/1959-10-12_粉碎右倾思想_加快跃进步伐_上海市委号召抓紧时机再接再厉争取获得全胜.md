Smash Right-leaning Thought, Accelerate the Great Leap Forward Pace
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Calls for Seizing the Opportunity, Continuing Efforts, and Striving for Total Victory

(Reported by our newspaper) From August 28th to September 17th, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged plenary session. Over 1,600 leading cadres from various levels of Party organizations in Shanghai participated in the meeting. The meeting listened to the transmission of the spirit and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China by Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and conducted earnest and enthusiastic study and discussion.

The meeting unanimously endorsed the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, believing that this meeting is of great historical significance for raising the Marxist-Leninist awareness of the entire Party, defending the Party's general line of socialist construction, resolutely implementing the general line, and promoting the continued leap forward of China's socialist construction. Through this transmission and study, the comrades attending the meeting received a profoundly important ideological education on the general line and Party spirit. Everyone's awareness was raised, confidence was boosted, and spirits were high. They resolved to, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, closely connect with the masses, resolutely smash right-leaning opportunist thought, go all out, continue to forge ahead courageously, and struggle to complete this year's Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets.

The comrades who attended the meeting deeply realized from the achievements of the Great Leap Forward across the country and in Shanghai that the general line of socialist construction formulated by the Party is the only correct path to develop China's socialist construction at high speed, change the backwardness of poverty and blankness, and build a strong industrial power. The meeting reviewed the work on various fronts this year and forcefully refuted, with full and victorious facts of the continued leap forward, the various slanders and defamations of the right-leaning opportunists against the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement. The meeting held that precisely because of the implementation of this general line, like everywhere else in the country, a vigorous and progressive situation has emerged in Shanghai's socialist construction. On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, from January to August this year, the total industrial output value of the urban area increased by 47% compared with the same period last year. Among the 31 major products included in the national plan, four, including metal cutting machine tools, have already completed this year's plan ahead of schedule, and 13 products have completed more than 65% of the annual plan. The meeting specifically refuted the fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists about the Great Leap Forward being "disproportionate" and "strained" with facts of comprehensive leap forward. Shanghai not only has a huge increase in industry and agriculture, but various industries are also leaping forward in an all-round way according to the needs of the country. From January to August this year, heavy industry increased by 72% compared with the same period last year, light industry increased by 34%, and the textile industry increased by 22%. Product quality has also improved significantly. In terms of agriculture, due to the realization of communization in the suburbs last year, the potential of rural production has been further brought into play. A bumper harvest of summer crops was achieved throughout the year, with an average yield per mu of three wheat crops increasing by 36.8% compared with last year, and rapeseed increasing by 63.5%. The area of various autumn crops exceeded the sowing plan, and the growth is good. Cotton and medium rice have begun to be harvested, and a bumper autumn harvest is promising. The diversified operations of suburban communes have also developed greatly. By the end of August, the number of pigs in stock had reached 1,436,000, greatly exceeding the level of last winter. The number of chickens and ducks has increased more than fourfold, the sown area of vegetables has been expanded, and the varieties have been increased, achieving self-sufficiency with a surplus. The needs of great production development have also vigorously promoted the leap forward in basic construction, transportation, commerce, and other aspects. From January to August this year, the completed investment in basic construction increased by 28% compared with the same period last year; by the end of September, about 80% of this year's national plan could be completed. The city's basic construction is growing month by month and quarter by quarter. 140 projects have been put into production, and 21 large construction units can complete the national plan three months ahead of schedule. The total volume of goods handled by railways and ports in the city increased by 57% from January to August this year compared with the same period last year. The total purchase value of the commercial sector increased by 32% in August this year compared with the same period last year; the increase in industrial products transferred to various places was 6.7%; and the total retail sales of commodities in the city increased by 17.7%. Among them, the total retail volume of seven major non-staple foods increased by 25.8%. How can the comprehensive growth of the production of means of production and means of consumption be said to be disproportionate? As for the temporary failure of certain products to meet the needs during the Great Leap Forward, it has happened in the past and will happen in the future. What is there to be surprised about?

The meeting held that Shanghai's rapid leap forward in production and construction reflects the requirements and needs of the national socialist construction's Great Leap Forward; and Shanghai's ability to leap forward has been strongly supported by the Great Leap Forward in various parts of the country. Taking steel as an example, the right-leaning opportunists slander the mass campaign to make steel as "not worth the loss," but the truth is exactly the opposite: precisely because of the mass campaign to make steel, Shanghai's source of pig iron for steelmaking has been greatly enriched. The increase in pig iron sources has further changed the face of Shanghai's steel industry. Not only has steel production capacity increased, but new rolling equipment has also been rapidly expanded. The growth of various types of steel has further met the needs of the growth in the production of machinery, electrical machinery, and light industry, driving the leap forward of the entire industry. At the same time, it is precisely because of the Great Leap Forward in various places that more agricultural and sideline product raw materials have been provided for Shanghai's industry. Shanghai's continued leap forward in light and textile industries this year has more abundant material conditions than in previous years. Taking raw cotton as an example, in the year from September last year to August this year, 8 million dan of raw cotton were transferred to Shanghai from various places, creating the highest record in history. In this way, Shanghai's industry produced more products to supply the needs of the people of the whole country, vigorously supporting the country's construction.

The meeting held that this fact of mutual promotion and comprehensive leap forward between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, and foreign and local production fully proves that the general line and a whole set of policies of walking on two legs are fully in line with the objective laws of the development of China's socialist economic construction. It ruthlessly declared the complete bankruptcy of a series of fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists who slandered the Great Leap Forward as "not worth the loss," "disproportionate," "completely strained," and "violating objective economic laws." The meeting held that this right-leaning opportunist thought represents the interests of the bourgeoisie and is a reflection of the anti-socialist trends of thought of the bourgeoisie in society. Therefore, the central government's instruction that right-leaning opportunist thought is the main danger at present is very timely and completely correct. Resolutely smashing right-leaning opportunist thought is of extremely great significance for consolidating and developing China's socialist revolution and construction.

The meeting held that the general line is a creative Marxist-Leninist line proposed by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee after summarizing the experience of China's socialist construction. It profoundly reflects the strong desire of the Chinese people to rapidly change the backwardness of poverty and blankness, and thus can fully mobilize and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, making China's Great Leap Forward have unparalleled and powerful vitality. The Great Leap Forward since last year is actually an unprecedentedly magnificent mass movement. In the movement, the broad masses of the people broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, dared to think and act in order to obtain greater material results from nature, and greatly improved the level of production technology. In the first seven months of this year, the working class in Shanghai proposed more than 260,000 innovation proposals, and more than 140,000 of them have been implemented. The city has successfully trial-produced more than 13,000 new products and varieties in the first eight months of this year. The achievements in this area have made Shanghai's industry take a big step towards high, large, precise, and advanced directions. Especially after the central government put forward the instruction to oppose right-leaning, encourage vigor, and vigorously increase production and practice economy, the broad masses of the people are in high spirits, and a new upsurge has emerged in the production leap forward in August and September. The production of steel, heavy machinery and equipment, and daily-use industrial products is growing rapidly. All this shows that because the general line has armed the cadres and the masses, China's Great Leap Forward has achieved unprecedentedly rich results. With the development of practice, the general line will surely exert greater power.

Through the education of the meeting, the comrades who attended the meeting all had a profound feeling: China's socialist revolution and construction are in a very good situation and developing very rapidly, truly not waiting for me. Studying the instructions of the central government made everyone's eyes bright, their minds clear, their spirits refreshed, and their energy even greater. Some comrades who had insufficient understanding of the good situation in the previous period and had right-leaning thoughts and emotions such as fear of difficulties and relaxation, also felt that their ears and eyes were clear and their minds were opened after the education of the meeting. They made serious criticisms and self-criticisms of their right-leaning thoughts and emotions and expressed their determination to catch up with the situation and quickly move to the forefront of the leap forward. The meeting held that the insufficient understanding of the good situation, and even the generation of certain right-leaning thoughts and emotions such as fear of difficulties and relaxation, is fundamentally due to the insufficient ideological preparation of some comrades for the socialist revolution; and the lack of thoroughness and firmness of the proletarian revolution. Therefore, earnestly transforming one's own thoughts and raising the class consciousness of each Party member is an important key to strengthening the unity of the entire Party and consciously implementing the Party's general line in the future. The meeting held that without the ambition to build a strong industrial country, without this ambition, there is no way to talk about loving the general line, supporting and implementing the general line. Every Communist Party member must wholeheartedly and faithfully dedicate themselves to the cause of the people, integrate their thoughts and feelings with the working class and the laboring people, closely connect with the masses, lead the masses, and do everything possible to overcome all difficulties in the way forward and constantly strive for new victories. The meeting held that the study and discussion of the enlarged meeting is only a good start. The meeting required Party organizations at all levels to further organize all Party members and carry out an in-depth study movement on the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee throughout the Party, constantly and repeatedly overcoming the thoughts of bourgeois individualism, raising the ideological awareness of the entire Party, establishing a dialectical materialist world outlook, and transforming themselves into true proletarian fighters.

Based on this year's national plan and the implementation of the plan in the past eight and a half months, the meeting finally made arrangements for the main work in the fourth quarter of this year. The meeting proposed the current fighting slogan: Celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, oppose right-leaning, encourage vigor, complete this year's national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets, and achieve a double harvest of increased production and economy and political ideology. The meeting determined that this year we must actively strive to complete the industrial output value plan of 24 billion yuan, and determined the output targets for major products such as steel, steel materials, heavy machinery, sulfuric acid, paper, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth. The meeting pointed out that there are still more than three months from now to the end of the year. In order to strive to complete the city's industrial output value plan of increasing by 40% compared with last year, there is still nearly 10 billion yuan of output value to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. At the same time, we must prepare for the continued leap forward of production and construction work next year, so the task is still very arduous. The meeting required that all departments must comprehensively grasp indicators such as output, product, variety, quality, economy, cost, and safety to ensure the comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of the plan in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. To this end, the meeting proposed to continue to deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, and grasp the following measures in the movement: First, the material departments and production departments should work together to do everything possible to solve the problem of raw materials. Second, continue to deepen the technical innovation movement, mobilize and organize the broad masses of employees to use the "three-in-one combination" method to solve the current key production problems and weak links, and continuously improve labor productivity. Third, deeply mobilize the masses, take the group as the foundation, launch a labor competition to increase production and practice economy between groups, workshops, and factories, and set off a wave of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, the advanced helping the backward, and finally catching up with the advanced." Fourth, in order to make the movement develop vigorously and steadily, the work from the bureau to the company to the enterprise must be deep and detailed. Each bureau, district, company, and enterprise should, according to their different circumstances, earnestly understand the key issues in the leap forward in production. The meeting required that in industrial production, basic construction, and transportation work, we should further promote the spirit of communism, vigorously organize collaboration, expand the scope of collaboration, and give full play to the favorable conditions and characteristics of Shanghai's many factories, large, medium, and small. The meeting also made clear provisions on the main tasks and requirements of basic construction, transportation, commerce, agriculture, and scientific, cultural, educational, and political and legal affairs.

The meeting held that the overall situation is very favorable. Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a huge political driving force for encouraging the people to forge ahead courageously; after deeply studying and implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the ideological awareness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people have been further improved, and their fighting spirit has been even higher. Therefore, the meeting required comrades on all fronts in the city to strengthen leadership, seize the opportunity, make persistent efforts, do everything possible, fight hard in the fourth quarter, strive for total victory on all fronts in this year's leap forward, and lay a good foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward next year.

　　粉碎右倾思想　加快跃进步伐
    上海市委号召抓紧时机再接再厉争取获得全胜
    本报讯　中共上海市委从8月28日到9月17日举行了扩大的全体会议。参加这次会议的有上海各级党组织的负责干部共一千六百多人。会议听取了中共中央政治局委员、上海市委第一书记柯庆施关于党的八届八中全会精神和决议的传达，并且进行了认真、热烈的学习和讨论。
    会议一致拥护党的八届八中全会的决议，认为这次会议对于提高全党的马克思列宁主义觉悟水平，保卫党的社会主义建设总路线、坚决贯彻总路线，促进我国社会主义建设事业的继续跃进，具有重大的历史意义。通过这次传达和学习，与会同志受到了一次极深刻的总路线的思想教育和党性教育。大家觉悟提高、信心充沛、心情舒畅，决心在毛主席、党中央的领导下，密切联系群众，坚决粉碎右倾机会主义思想，鼓足干劲，继续奋勇前进，为争取提前和超额完成今年的跃进计划而斗争。
    到会同志从全国和上海的跃进成就中，深刻地体会到党所制订的社会主义建设总路线，是高速度地发展我国社会主义建设、改变一穷二白的落后面貌、建立富强的工业大国的唯一正确途径。会议检查了今年各条战线上的工作，以继续跃进的充分的胜利事实，有力地驳斥了右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动的各种污蔑和诽谤。会议认为：正是由于贯彻了这条总路线，和全国各地一样，上海的各项社会主义建设事业出现了蓬勃前进的大好形势。在去年大跃进的基础上，今年1月到8月，市区工业产值又比去年同期增长了47％。全市列入国家计划的三十一种主要产品中，已有金属切削机床等四种提前完成今年计划，有十三种产品已完成年度计划65％以上。会议特别以全面跃进的事实，针锋相对地驳斥了右倾机会主义者所说的大跃进“比例失调”“关系紧张”等等谬论。上海不仅工农业都有巨大增长，各种工业也根据全国的需要，正在全面跃进。今年1月到8月，重工业比去年同期增长72％，轻工业增长34％，纺织工业增长22％。产品质量也有显著提高。农业方面，由于去年郊区实现了公社化，农村生产潜力进一步发挥出来。全年夏熟作物丰收，三麦平均亩产比去年提高36.8％，油菜籽提高63.5％。各种大秋作物面积超过播种计划，生长情况良好，棉花、中稻已开始收割，秋季丰收大有希望。郊区公社多种经营也有巨大发展。8月底生猪圈存量已达一百四十三万六千头，大大超过去年冬天的水平。鸡鸭增加四倍以上，蔬菜播种面积扩大，品种增加，已做到自给有余。生产大发展的需要，也有力地促进了基本建设、交通运输和商业等各方面的跃进。今年1月到8月基本建设完成投资额比去年同期增长28％；到9月底止，约可完成今年国家计划80％左右。全市基本建设逐月逐季增长，已有一百四十项工程投入生产，有二十一个大的建设单位可提前三个月完成国家计划。全市铁路、港口货物总吞吐量，今年1月到8月比去年同期增长57％。商业部门收购总值今年8月比去年同期增长32％；调往各地工业品增长6.7％；市内商品零售总额增长17.7％。其中七个主要副食品零售总量增长25.8％。生产资料与消费资料生产的全面增长，怎么能说是比例失调？至于在大跃进中，某些产品的一时赶不上需要，过去如此，今后也会出现，有什么值得大惊小怪的？
    会议认为，上海生产建设事业飞速跃进，正是反映了全国社会主义建设事业大跃进的要求和需要；而上海之所以能够跃进，又是得到了全国各地大跃进的有力支持。以钢为例，右倾机会主义分子污蔑全民办钢铁“得不偿失”，而事实真象恰恰相反：正是由于全民办钢铁，上海炼钢的生铁来源极大的丰富了。生铁来源增加，又进一步改变了上海钢铁工业的面貌。不仅炼钢生产能力增加了，新的轧钢设备也迅速扩充起来。各种钢材的增长，又进一步满足了机械、电机以及轻工业生产增长的需要，带动了整个工业的跃进。同时正是由于各地大跃进，为上海工业提供了更多的农副产品原料，上海轻纺工业今年的继续跃进有了比往年更丰富的物质条件。以原棉为例，去年9月到今年8月这一年度中，各地调运上海的原棉达八百万担，创造了历史上最高的纪录。这样，就使上海工业生产出更多的产品供应了全国人民的需要，有力地支援了国家的建设。
    会议认为：这种工业与农业、重工业与轻工业以及外地与本地之间生产相互促进、全面跃进的事实，完全证明总路线以及一整套两条腿走路的方针是完全符合我国社会主义经济建设发展的客观规律的。它无情地宣告了右倾机会主义分子污蔑大跃进“得不偿失”“比例失调”“全面紧张”“违背客观经济规律”等一系列谬论的彻底破产。会议认为，这种右倾机会主义思想代表着资产阶级的利益，是社会上资产阶级反社会主义思潮的反映。因此，中央指出右倾机会主义思想是当前主要危险的指示，非常及时，完全正确。坚决粉碎右倾机会主义思想，这对巩固和发展我国的社会主义革命建设事业具有极重大的意义。
    会议认为，总路线是毛主席党中央总结了我国社会主义建设经验而提出的一条创造性的马克思、列宁主义的路线。它深刻地反映了我国人民要求迅速改变一穷二白落后面貌的强烈愿望，因而就能充分调动和发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，使我国的大跃进具有无比强大的生命力。去年以来的大跃进，实际上是一个空前壮阔的群众运动。在运动中广大群众破除迷信，解放思想，为向自然界索取更大的物质成果，敢想敢为，使生产技术水平有了极大的提高。在今年前七个月，上海工人阶级就提出了二十六万多件革新建议，有十四万多件已经实现。全市今年头八个月试制成功的新产品新品种有一万三千多种。这方面的成就，已使上海工业在向高、大、精、尖方向大大迈进了一步。特别在中央提出反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的指示以后，广大群众斗志昂扬，8、9两月的生产跃进又出现了新的高潮。钢、重型机器设备和日用工业品的生产都在迅速增长。这一切说明：由于总路线武装了干部和群众，我国的大跃进已经取得史无前例的丰硕成果。随着实践的发展，总路线必将愈来愈发挥更大威力。
    经过会议的教育，与会同志都有一种深刻的感受：我国的社会主义革命和建设事业，形势很好，发展很快，真正是时不我待。学习了中央的指示，使大家眼睛雪亮，头脑清醒，精神振奋，干劲更足。有些前一时期对大好形势认识不足、有畏难松劲等右倾思想情绪的同志，经过会议的教育，也感到耳聪目明，茅塞顿开。他们对自己的右倾思想情绪作了严肃的批评和自我批评，并表示决心赶上形势，迅速走到跃进前列。会议认为，对大好形势认识不足，甚至产生某些畏难松劲等右倾思想情绪，基本原因是若干同志对社会主义革命的思想准备不足；缺乏无产阶级的革命的彻底性和坚定性。因此，认真改造自己的思想，提高每个党员的阶级觉悟，是今后加强全党团结，自觉地贯彻执行党的总路线的重要关键。会议认为：没有建立工业强国的雄心大略，缺乏这种志气，就谈不到热爱总路线、拥护和贯彻执行总路线。每一个共产党员，必须全心全意，忠实于人民的事业，使自己的思想感情和工人阶级劳动人民融成一片，密切联系群众，领导群众，千方百计地克服前进中的一切困难，不断地争取新的胜利。会议认为：扩大会议的学习和讨论只是一个良好的开始，会议要求各级党组织进一步组织全体党员，在全党开展一个关于八中全会决议的深入的学习运动，不断地反复地克服资产阶级个人主义的思想，提高全党的思想觉悟，树立辩证唯物主义的世界观，把自己改造成为真正的无产阶级的战士。
    根据今年的国家计划和八个半月来执行计划的情况，会议最后对今年第四季度的主要工作作了安排。会议提出当前的战斗口号是：庆祝建国十周年，坚决贯彻执行八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲，提前和超额完成今年的国家计划，实现增产节约、政治思想双丰收。会议确定今年必须积极地力争完成工业产值二百四十亿元的计划，并确定了钢、钢材、重型机械、硫酸、纸、棉纱、棉布等主要产品的产量指标。会议指出，从现在到年底还有三个多月时间，为了力争完成今年全市比去年增长40％的工业产值计划，今年第四季度还有近一百亿元的产值要完成，同时还要为明年生产和建设工作的继续跃进作好准备，因此任务还是十分繁重的。会议要求各部门必须全面抓产量、产品、品种、质量、节约、成本、安全等指标，保证多快好省地全面完成和超额完成计划。为此，会议提出要继续深入开展增产节约运动，并在运动中抓紧以下各项措施：一、物资部门和生产部门应共同努力，千方百计解决原材料问题。二、继续深入开展技术革新运动，发动和组织广大职工运用“三结合”的方法，解决当前的生产关键问题和薄弱环节，不断提高劳动生产率。三、深入发动群众，以小组为基础，展开小组与小组、车间与车间、工厂与工厂之间的增产节约劳动竞赛，掀起“比先进、学先进、赶先进、先进帮助落后，最后赶上先进”的热潮。四、为使运动开展得轰轰烈烈而又踏踏实实，从局到公司、到企业，工作必须抓深抓细，各局、区、公司、企业都应根据各自不同的情况，切实了解生产跃进中的关键问题。会议要求工业生产、基本建设和交通运输工作中，进一步发扬共产主义精神，大力组织协作，扩大协作范围，充分发挥上海工厂多、大中小齐全的有利条件和特点。会议对基本建设、交通运输、商业、农业以及科学、文化教育、政法等主要工作任务和要求，也作了明确规定。
    会议认为：整个形势十分有利。庆祝建国十周年是鼓舞人民奋勇前进的巨大政治动力；在深入学习和贯彻执行党的八中全会决议后，广大干部和群众的思想觉悟和劳动热情更为提高，斗志更加昂扬。因此，会议要求全市各条战线的同志加强领导、抓紧时机、再接再厉、千方百计，大战第四季度，争取各条战线在今年跃进中获得全胜，并为明年的继续大跃进打下良好基础。
