Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 18th: The General Secretary of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, Papaioannou, announced at a press conference on the 16th that the Progressive Party of the Working People had secretly held its Ninth Congress last month.

The British Governor has prohibited the Progressive Party of the Working People from holding congresses publicly.

Papaioannou said that the congress discussed and unanimously adopted the party's new program and elected a new Central Committee. Papaioannou was unanimously elected as General Secretary.

Papaioannou said: The congress showed that the whole party is united, and despite the extremely difficult circumstances, the number of party members is more than ever before. The Progressive Party of the Working People has been strengthened and has more experience than before.

Papaioannou then explained the party's new program. He said that the party's policy is to strive for the complete independence, peace, and demilitarization of Cyprus, and to pursue friendship and understanding with all countries on the basis of equality and respect for independence, and for territorial integrity. The party advocates developing trade relations with all countries that purchase Cypriot products. The Progressive Party of the Working People strives for the unity of the Greek and Turkish communities.

Referring to the future elections in Cyprus, Papaioannou pointed out that the continuation of the ban on the Progressive Party of the Working People is extremely absurd. It is inconceivable to hold democratic elections in Cyprus while the political party is in an illegal position. He said that the principles of the Progressive Party of the Working People regarding elections are: first, to strive for the unity of the people and various organizations as much as possible; second, to guarantee the minimum program of democratic rights and economic development.

　　塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党通过新纲领
    争取塞浦路斯完全独立
    新华社18日讯　尼科西亚消息：塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党总书记巴巴约安努16日在记者招待会上宣布，劳动人民进步党已经在上月秘密举行了第九次代表大会。
    英国总督禁止劳动人民进步党公开举行代表大会。
    巴巴约安努说，代表大会讨论了并且一致通过了党的新的纲领。选出了新的中央委员会。巴巴约安努被一致选为总书记。
    巴巴约安努说：代表大会表明全党是团结一致的，尽管处境极端困难，党的人数比以往任何时候多。劳动人民进步党加强了，经验也比以前丰富了。
    巴巴约安努接着阐释了党的新纲领。他说，党的政策是争取塞浦路斯的完全独立、和平和非军事化，在平等和尊重独立、领土完整的基础上同一切国家友好和谅解。党主张同所有购买塞浦路斯的产品的国家发展贸易关系。劳动人民进步党努力争取希腊族人民和土耳其族人民的团结。
    巴巴约安努谈到塞浦路斯未来的选举时指出，对劳动人民进步党的禁令的继续是极端荒谬的。在政党处于非法地位的情况下，要在塞浦路斯举行民主的选举，是不能设想的。他说，劳动人民进步党关于选举的原则是：一、尽最大可能争取实现人民和各个组织的团结；二、保障民主权利和经济发展的最低纲领。
