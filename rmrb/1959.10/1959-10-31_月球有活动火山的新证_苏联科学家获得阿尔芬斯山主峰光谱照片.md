    New Evidence of Active Volcanoes on the Moon
    Soviet Scientists Obtain Spectroscopic Photographs of the Central Peak of the Alphonsus Crater

    The renowned Soviet astronomer Kozyrev, who discovered lunar volcanic eruptions last year, stated at the Pulkovo Observatory on the 29th that on October 23rd, he obtained another spectroscopic photograph of the same region on the moon (the central peak of the Alphonsus crater) at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. At that time, he obtained this photograph while observing with a fifty-inch reflecting telescope. Kozyrev pointed out that this spectroscopic photograph indicates that the Alphonsus crater is still an active (volcanic) region on the moon. This is further proof of the existence of volcanic processes on the moon.

    Last November, Kozyrev, at the same location and using the same telescope, discovered an unusual scene on the central peak of the Alphonsus crater. The crater appeared red, and then the brightness of the peak suddenly increased almost twofold. This phenomenon lasted for thirty minutes. Simultaneously, bright bands of carbon and its compounds appeared in the spectrum of the peak, after which the crater returned to normal. Scientists believe this was a lunar volcanic eruption, and consider it one of the most significant discoveries in fifty years.

    月球有活动火山的新证
    苏联科学家获得阿尔芬斯山主峰光谱照片
    去年发现月球火山爆发的苏联著名天文学家科齐列夫29日在普尔科沃天文台说，10月23日，他在克里米亚天体物理学天文台又获得了月球上同一地区（阿尔芬斯寰形山中央山峰）的光谱照片。当时，他是用五十吋的反射望远镜进行观测时获得这张照片的。科齐列夫指出，这张光谱照片表明阿尔芬斯寰形山仍然是月球上活动（火山）的地区。它是月球上存在着火山过程的又一个证明。
    科齐列夫在去年11月在同一地点用同一望远镜，发现了阿尔芬斯寰形山中央峰一种不寻常的景色。寰形山显出了红色，接着，这个山峰的亮度突然增加了几乎一倍。这个现象延续了三十分钟。同时，在山峰的光谱中出现了碳及其化合物的亮带，以后寰形山又恢复了常态。科学家认为这是月球火山爆发的现象。并认为这是五十年来最重大的发现之一。
