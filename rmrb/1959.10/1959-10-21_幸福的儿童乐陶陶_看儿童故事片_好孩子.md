The lush green fields are filled with a haze like light smoke, and birds on the branches flutter their wings and sing to welcome the morning sun. What is that twinkling in the clump of low trees by the cotton field? Dewdrops? Water grapes? Hey, don't shout, those are Honghong and Doudou, the eyes of two five- or six-year-old children. Suddenly, Honghong makes a few bird calls, and Mingkui and Baomei, fifth-grade students who are working in the cotton field, duck down and dart into the grass. Secretary Qian, Director Chen, and Teacher Tian, who came especially for this, exchange glances, their eyes all fixed on a child who is still frantically burrowing into the grass...

This small scene in the excellent color children's film "Good Children" can be regarded as a silhouette of the film's plot. Just entering summer vacation, Mingkui and Baomei ask Director Chen – Mingkui's father – for a small piece of land to plant an experimental plot. The wheat experimental plot planted by their father yielded high yields, enticing the children to also conduct experiments. When their father didn't agree, the two children secretly started planting an experimental cotton plot with their younger siblings – Doudou and Honghong. Later, other children joined their ranks; the leaders and masses of the commune also cared for and helped them. The film revolves around the golden waves stirred up by this group of children with different personalities planting an experimental plot, sketching a vivid and beautiful picture of the pure and lovely children's world in a bright and humorous way, vividly showing the happy and beautiful life of children under the sunshine of socialism.

From the children's naivete, enthusiasm, and mysterious expressions in their determination to engage in experimental plots, we can not only clearly see their simple, innocent, and beautiful hearts, but also strongly feel the atmosphere of the galloping agricultural Great Leap Forward. The scene of the children playing in the small river is also particularly wonderful and moving. Hearing the old grandfather say that crabs can be used as fertilizer, they all compete to catch crabs. Only Xiaoqing, afraid of being pinched by crab claws, sits alone on the bank, dangling his feet in the water. Unexpectedly, A Hu secretly puts a large crab claw on his toe, causing an interesting uproar. There are many such interesting plots in the film.

Some people once felt that it was inevitable that similar subjects such as "Good Children" would be "dull and tasteless" when handled. Judging from this film, this worry is unfounded. In the process of directing this film, the veteran filmmaker Yang Xiaozhong neither deviated from the theme of the film to pursue children's fun aimlessly, nor was he bound by the words "experimental plot." The lives of the children presented to the audience are broad and rich: there are scenes of tense exams before the summer vacation, poetic and picturesque scenes of rowing light boats and singing, and dreamlike charming dreams...

Children's plays are indeed difficult to shoot, especially those involving children who are several years old. But after the director's careful guidance, Honghong and Doudou, the two five- or six-year-old children in the film "Good Children," performed particularly lively and lovely. (Attached picture)

    幸福的儿童乐陶陶
    ——看儿童故事片“好孩子”
    何其烈
  葱绿的田野弥漫着青烟似的薄雾，枝头鸟儿迎着朝阳拍翅欢唱。那块棉田边的矮树丛里滴溜溜闪烁着的是什么？露珠？水葡萄？喂，别高声嚷呀，那是红红、豆豆，两个五六岁孩子的眼睛。忽然红红的嘴里发出几声鸟叫，正在棉田里劳动的五年级小学生明奎和宝妹头一低，一个箭步就钻到草丛里去了。特意前来的钱书记、陈社长和田老师相互递着眼色，他们的目光都落在一个还不住往草里乱钻的孩子身上……
    优秀的彩色儿童故事片“好孩子”里的这个小镜头，可以当作这部影片故事情节的一个剪影。刚度暑假的明奎和宝妹要求陈社长——明奎的爸爸给他们一小块地种试验田。爸爸种的小麦试验田获得高额丰产，引诱得孩子们也想搞试验。爸爸没答应，这两个孩子就同他们的弟弟、妹妹——豆豆、红红偷偷种起棉花试验田来了。以后别的小伙伴也加入到他们的行列；社里的领导和群众也都关怀和帮助他们。影片环绕着这群不同性格的孩子种试验田中所兴起的金波银浪，明快而风趣地勾画出一幅幅纯真、美丽的儿童世界的图景，生动地显示了在社会主义阳光照耀下孩子们幸福美好的生活。
    我们从孩子们那一心要搞试验田的稚气、热情、神秘的神色里，不仅可以清晰看见他们淳朴、天真、美丽的心灵，而且使人强烈感到万马奔腾的农业大跃进的气息。孩子们在小河里嬉戏的场面也分外精彩动人。听老爷爷说螃蟹可以做肥料，他们一个个竞相捉起螃蟹来。只有怕蟹钳夹手的晓清独个儿坐在岸边，两只脚伸到水里摇晃着，冷不防阿虎偷偷地把一只大蟹钳放在他的脚指头上，引起一场有趣的风波。像这样饶有趣味的情节，影片里有很多。
    曾经有人觉得类似“好孩子”这样的题材处理起来总难免不“索然寡味”。从这部片子看来，这种担心是没有根据的。电影老前辈杨小仲在导演这部影片的过程中，既没有脱离影片的主题毫无目的地去追求孩子乐趣，也没有被“试验田”三字缚住手脚。呈现在观众眼前的孩子们的生活是广阔而丰富多采的：有暑假前紧张考试的情景，有划着轻舟歌唱的诗画镜头，有童话般迷人的梦境……
    孩子的戏的确很难拍，尤其是几岁的孩子。但是经过导演的精心诱导，“好孩子”这部影片里的红红、豆豆这两个五六岁的孩子，却演得特别活泼可爱。（附图片）
