A Thousand Lies Cannot Deceive a Clear Mind
　　Xú Jiācháng, Jiaocheng, Hebei

　　This is a story about my ideological struggle:

　　One day, I went to town to get a haircut. As soon as I entered, the barber politely asked me to sit down and handed me a comic book to read. However, I was anxious because the work in the fields was very busy. How could I sit here and read comic books?

　　I said, “I don’t want to read comic books. Please give me a haircut quickly. The work at home is busy.”

　　The barber pointed to the people sitting around and said with a smile, "Old man, haircuts are given in order of arrival. These people came before you."

　　I asked again, “How long will I have to wait?”

　　The barber said, "About two hours!"

　　I was annoyed when I heard this, and thought to myself: "Haircuts must be in order of arrival? The team is going to have a meeting in the afternoon. How can I wait two hours?" I picked up my straw hat, got up, and left.

　　I didn't get a haircut, and I wondered on the way: Why do haircuts have to be in order of arrival?

　　Are there fewer barbers than before? No.

　　Ten years ago, there was only one barbershop in town, with two barbers. At that time, haircuts were not in order of arrival. Now there are four barbershops on four streets, and each barbershop has three or four masters and two or three apprentices. Our commune also has a barbershop, the management area also has a barbershop, and many production teams also have full-time barbers.

　　Is the barber's work efficiency low? No.

　　In the past, a haircut took more than an hour. Now it still takes about an hour. After the haircut, the barber still holds a mirror to show the front, back, left, and right, and asks for opinions. Look! The big-character posters on the wall are full of: "You give haircuts quickly and well, and your barbering skills have greatly improved," "Barbers, worthy of praise, serve customers day and night with great enthusiasm."

　　Are there more people getting haircuts now? Let's count. In the past, haircuts were only for a few wealthy people, landlords, and merchants. Wasn't it only after the advanced cooperative that an old man like me started getting haircuts? I remember the first time I entered a barbershop, my heart was still pounding! There weren't so many people getting haircuts at that time, and people said I was "growing younger in old age." Only since the people's commune was established last year has everyone been so united without the superiors making a call. Look, young people all have large side-parted hairstyles, and girls also go to the barbershop to wash and perm their hair. Although we old men shave our heads and beards, we are not like we used to be, squatting by the puddle, wetting our hair, and using a razor to shave each other. Now? We all sit in barbershops as customers, blowing our little mustaches, looking proud and energetic.

　　Right! Right! There are more people getting haircuts—maybe increased by tens of millions of times. It's not that there are fewer barbers, nor is it that the barbers' efficiency is low.

　　But why do people now want to go to the barbershop and ask a barber for a haircut?

　　Is it people's love of beauty and enjoyment?

　　As the saying goes, "Shaving your head and braiding your hair makes you half a year younger." We couldn't care about these things in the old society. Now, after the people's commune, our farmers live a busy and happy working life. Young people are happy, and old people are living younger and younger. Who doesn't want to sit in a barber's chair and comfortably dress their head in a decent manner, clean and tidy, handsome and refreshed.

　　Think about it, in the old society, in the hard days, we worried about food and drink, and our farmers were unhappy. "We have the leisure, but no spare money." In fact, we couldn't be happy even if we wanted to. "A happy heart" must have spare money. Like our farmers now, everything goes well, the future is bright, and we feel happy. "People are refreshed when they have happy events," and everyone wants to have fun. Life is prosperous, and money comes easily. Right now, cutting a hundred catties of green grass earns three yuan. Raising five hens that lay eggs is enough for pocket money, not to mention wages, not to mention the money that workers bring home from outside! That's not all. Farmers don't spend much on daily life, which is a big deal. Think about it: we have self-retained plots for vegetables; we grow our own tobacco leaves for smoking; we have thermos bottles and flashlights, what else is there to buy? It's really money weighing down our pockets. Young people of fifteen or sixteen years old also hold a lot of bills. (In the old society, let alone this age, as long as there were parents in charge, no matter how old you grew, you couldn't touch a penny. There was a real saying in the countryside about "people who don't know how to spend money," and it was not a joke at all). I am also like this. Now, a haircut costs two jiao, and I don't even notice it. In the past, two jiao was two jin of grain, and I would never have been willing to spend it. When there's more money, our eyes become bigger.

　　Yes, our farmers have money, have a desire for happiness, and the things in the market are very cheap. Who doesn't want to buy something and enjoy it? However, with 600 million people in the country, and thousands of households taking action, it's amazing. Even if the output of various commodities increases dozens of times, it cannot fully meet the needs for a while. Like haircuts, everyone goes to the barbershop, and each barber has three apprentices. Even if you set up an apprentice training class, the supply still cannot meet the demand. In the past, farmers used grass ash water to wash clothes, but now you don't see anyone using grass ash water anymore. Everyone feels that it doesn't matter to spend more than a jiao to buy a bar of soap. Now young people are literate, and children go to school. Everyone has a fountain pen, and everyone uses some paper every day. People's feet are also precious, and they take walking as a burden, and want to buy a bicycle to ride...

　　"You don't know the price of firewood and rice until you are in charge of the household." I didn't expect that I didn't get a haircut, but I learned a political lesson, which made me think of so many things. In a nutshell, it's not that there are few things in the market, it's that purchasing power is greater. This is a phenomenon of improved people's lives, which is gratifying and commendable.

　　Without spending anyone else's words, I walked along the way and figured out the problem completely.

　　Right-leaning opportunists, do you understand the intention of my telling this story? I want to let you know: we farmers have personal experience of the true facts of changes in the rural market. Even if some things are temporarily tight, and we feel a little stuck in our hearts for a while, we cannot be deceived by you. We farmers are realists. Comparing, looking, thinking, and calculating before and after, we will naturally understand. Don't think that we farmers don't understand anything. We see more than you think. Your sweet words and flowery language, to us, are just "selling the Hundred Family Surnames in the Sage's Mansion" "A dog bites Lü Dongbin - not recognizing a good person."

　　千句谎言骗不了一想便
    通河北交河  徐家常
    这是我作思想斗争的一个故事：
    有一天，我进城去，想理发。一进门，理发师很客气地让我落座，递给我一本小人书看。但是，我心里很急，地里活大忙，那能坐在这里看小人书呢？
    我说：“我不看小人书，快理发，家里活忙。”
    理发师指着坐在周围的几个人笑道：“老大爷，理发得挨班，这些人都比你来的早。”
    我又问：“得等多长时间？”
    理发师说：“两个钟头吧！”
    我一听烦了，心里话：“理发还得挨班，午后队上要开会，哪能等两个钟头。”拿起草帽子，一抬屁股走开了。
    发没理成，一路上想：为什么理发还要挨班呢？
    理发师比过去少了吗？不。
    十年前，城里就一个理发所，两个理发师，那时候理发是不挨班的，现在四条街四个理发所，哪个理发所里也有三、四个师傅和两、三个徒弟。俺们公社里也有理发所，管理区也有理发所，好些生产队上也设有专职理发的人。
    理发师的工作效率低了吗？不。
    过去理发，一个头需要一个多钟头。现在也是不过一个钟头，理完发，理发师还拿着镜子左右前后的照照，征求意见。看！墙上的大字报贴满了：“你们理发快又好，理发技术大提高”，“理发师，真可夸，昼夜待客干劲大。”
    如今理发的人多了吗？屈指一算。过去理发都是些少数有钱的人，地主、商家。像我这老头子，不是只从高级合作化以后才开始理发吗？记得头一次进理发所，心里还打扑通呢！那时候理发的人还不这么多，都说我是“老来少”；只从去年人民公社化以来，上级也没有作过号召，人们就这么心齐。你看吧，年青人没有不留大分头的，姑娘们洗头、烫发也要进理发所。我们这些老头子虽然是剃光头、刮胡子，也不像过去一样了，蹲在水坑边上，弄湿头发，自己拿把剃头刀，你给我剃，我给你剃。现在呢？都是坐在理发所里当顾客，小胡一吹，神神气气。
    对！对！是理发的人多了——可能增加千万倍，不是理发师少了，也不是理发师效率低了。
    可是，为什么现在人们都想进理发所请理发师理发呢？
    是人们爱美和享受思想吗？
    常言：“剃头打辫子，年青一半子”，旧社会顾不了这些，如今，人民公社化后，咱们农民过着紧张、愉快的劳动生活，青年人快乐，老年人越活越年青，谁不愿坐在理发椅上，舒舒坦坦地把自己的头打扮的像个样，一干二净，俊俏爽洁。
    想吧，旧社会，苦日子，愁吃愁喝，咱们农民不乐。“空有闲心，没有闲钱。”实际上想乐也乐不起来。“乐心”必有余钱在。像现在咱们农民，事事顺心，前途光明，心里痛快，“人有喜事精神爽”，都想乐乐；生活富裕了，钱来的方便，眼下，打一百斤青草就给三元，喂上五只老母鸡下蛋，也够零花钱，别说工资钱，别说出外工人捎回家来的钱啦！这还不算，农民过日子没花项是个大事，你想吧：吃菜有自留园；抽烟自己种的有烟叶；水瓶、手电全有啦，还有什么可买。真是钱坠腰包，十五、六岁的年青娃子也大把的票子拿着，（在旧社会别说这点年纪，只要有父母当家，长到多大年纪也摸不着个钱皮，乡间有说“不会花钱的人”，那可是个真事，半点不是笑话）。我也是这样，现在，理发一次花两角，根本看不到眼里，要搁过去，两角钱，二斤粮食，说什么也舍不得，钱多了，眼睛也大了。
    对，咱们农民有钱，有乐心，市上的东西又都很便宜，谁不想买点，享受享受，可是，全国六亿人，千家万户一动手，了不起，就算各样商品一下增产几十倍，一时也不能充分满足需要。像理发一样，人人都进理发所，理发师一人带三个徒弟，你算成立徒弟训练班也供不应求；过去农民都淋草灰水洗衣服，现在不见一个淋草灰水的了，都觉得一角多钱买块肥皂算不了什么；现在年青人都识字，小孩们都上学，每人挂着一支钢笔，每人每天要用一些纸；人们的脚步也贵了，拿走路都当成负担了，都想买辆自行车骑；……
    “不当家不知柴米贵”，没想到，发没理成，倒给自己上了一堂政治课，叫我想起了这许多许多。拢总一句话，不是市上的东西少，是购买力大了，这是人民生活提高的现象，可喜可贺。
    也没费别人的一言之力，自己走了一路，就把问题想了个一通百通。
    右倾机会主义分子，你明了我讲这个故事的用意吗？我是想叫你知道：农村市场变化的真情实底，我们农民都有切身体验，就算有的东西暂时紧一点，一时心里蹩着扣，也受不了你们的骗，我们农民是现实主义，一前一后的比比、看看、想想、算算，就自然而然地通了。你别觉着俺们农民不懂啥，我们见到的比你们想到的都多，你们的巧言花语，我们听起来，不过是“圣人府里卖百家姓”“狗咬吕洞宾——不认真人”罢了。
