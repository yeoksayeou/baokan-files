When the Red Flowers Bloom
Wang Hai

The nurse walked over lightly, holding a newborn baby in her arms, and greeted an old Lahu woman from afar: "A star has lit up in the sky, your family has a fat grandson."

The old woman quickly stretched out her withered hands, took the little grandson, wiped her dim old eyes, and looked at him with surprise and for a long time. A satisfied smile floated on her wrinkled face, and she thanked the nurse repeatedly with a happy expression: "Good girl, you've worked hard." After seeing the child, she walked out of the hospital gate with a limp. She raised her head and suddenly saw a tree full of red flowers in full bloom. The smile immediately slipped from her face, and her lips, stained red by betel nut, trembled.

This ancient red flower tree by the hospital gate has a thick trunk and strong branches. The green leaves have not yet sprouted, but the bare branches are covered with red flowers, clusters and clusters, strings and strings, reddening the blue sky. The old woman sat alone under the red flower tree, gazing at the blooming red flowers, and remembered those years of suffering.

…That year, just when the red flowers were in full bloom, a pregnant Lahu woman was returning from the market. She carried a heavy back basket, struggling along a narrow path close to the cliff, climbing the mountain. She stopped every few steps, panting. When she reached a red flower tree, she couldn't walk any further. She held her stomach tightly with both hands, bit her lip hard, and tried to endure the unbearable pain. Later, she gasped for breath, sweat like dew oozing from her forehead, and she groaned miserably... But all that answered her was a gust of evening wind.

When the desolate moonlight shone on the forest, a baby was born. The mother struggled to cut the umbilical cord with a bamboo splinter, and picked two banana leaves as swaddling clothes. Her hair was disheveled, and she leaned against the tree trunk, her face as yellow as wax, and blood still flowing from the corner of her mouth. She stared at the stars, praying sincerely: "God! Let me be a cow or a horse in my next life, but don't let me be a woman again."... Today, it is the season when the red flowers are in full bloom again, and her daughter-in-law has given birth. She is staying in a clean and tidy hospital, with doctors and nurses to take care of her...

"Mom!"

The old woman woke up from the whirlpool of memories and raised her tearful face. In front of her stood a valiant and heroic young man, wearing a bright long knife, wrapped in a red cloth turban, his clothes open, revealing his dark, bulging chest muscles. Hearing this familiar call, the old woman vaguely felt a burst of crying. Looking at this tall figure, the old woman vaguely remembered the baby wrapped in banana leaves. The old woman couldn't bear it any longer, she hugged her son's legs and sobbed.

The young man squatted down inexplicably, comforting and explaining excitedly: "Mom! I'm late, because we're making steel today, we've made steel! Look, steel for making tractors!" He took out a piece of black steel from his floral bag, which shone in the sun.

"How can I pour a barrel of bitter water on someone who is drinking sweet wine?" the old woman muttered to herself, "A cut bamboo will never sprout again, and the flowing water will never return."

"Mom! What are you saying?" Her son was even more puzzled.

Like sunshine and rain at the same time, the old woman smiled through her sobs: "It's nothing, go in and take a look at your fat son, he looks just like you."

They walked into the hospital, the Lahu man holding the swaddling clothes in one hand and raising the black steel in the other. He laughed, laughing as freely as the sound of pine waves.

The old woman blessed: "Grow hard wings and fly! My little bird!" She looked out the window again, and saw clusters and clusters of red flowers, trembling with fire-like light, smiling at her.

    红花盛开的时候
    王海
    护士姑娘轻盈地走过来，怀里抱着个初生的婴儿，老远就和一位?颇族的老大妈打招呼：“天上亮起颗星星，你家添了个胖孙孙。”
    老大妈忙伸出干癟的手，抱过小孙孙，擦擦昏花的老眼，惊喜地、久久地端详着。她皱纹交错的脸上，浮起满意的笑，眉飞色舞地向护士连声道谢：“好姑娘，你们辛苦了。”看过孩子，她蹒跚着走出医院大门，一仰头，猛然看见一树盛开的红花，笑容立刻从她脸上滑下来，被槟榔染红的嘴唇也不住地颤动着。
    医院的大门边的这棵古老的红花树，有着粗大的树干，苍劲的枝桠，绿叶还未冒出，光秃秃的枝干上，却开出朵朵红花，一簇簇，一串串，把蓝天都映红了。老大妈独自坐在红花树下，凝视着盛开的红花，想起了那苦难的岁月。
    ……那一年，正当红花盛开的时候，一个怀孕的?颇族少妇赶街归来。她挎着沉重的背箩，吃力地沿着一条紧靠悬崖的羊肠小路，登上山峰。她三步一停，五步一喘，到得一棵红花树下，就再也走不动了。她双手紧捂着肚子，用力咬住嘴唇，竭力忍受着难耐的疼痛。后来，她喘着粗气，额上渗出许多露一样的汗珠子，凄厉地呻吟起来……然而回答她的，只是一阵飒飒的晚风。
    当凄凉的月光照着森林时，一个婴儿诞生了。母亲挣扎着，用竹片给婴儿切断脐带，摘两片芭蕉叶子当襁褓。她披头散发地依着树身，脸色像黄蜡一样，嘴角上还流着鲜血。她痴望着星星，虔诚地祈祷：“神啊！下辈子让我变牛变马，可不要让我再变女人。”……今天，又是红花盛开的时节，自己的儿媳妇生产了，她住进了干净整洁的医院，有医生护士照扶……
    “阿妈！”
    老人从回忆的漩涡里清醒过来，抬起泪水蒙蒙的脸。面前是一个慓悍、英武的小伙子；佩着雪亮的长刀，缠着红布包头，衣襟敞开着，露出黧黑地、凸起的胸肌。听到这亲切的呼唤，老人恍惚觉得是一阵的啼哭；看着这魁伟的身躯，老人依稀记起芭蕉叶缠裹着的婴儿。老人再也忍不住了，她抱住儿子的腿，啜泣起来。
    年轻的小伙子莫名其妙地蹲下来，兴奋地安慰和解释着：“阿妈！我来迟了，因为我们今天出钢，我们炼出钢来啦！你看，造拖拉机的钢呀！”他从花挎包里，摸出一块乌黑乌黑的钢来，它在阳光下闪亮着。
    “我怎么能把一筒苦水，劈头劈脸浇在一个正在喝甜酒的人的身上。”老人喃喃地自语：“砍倒的竹子再不会发芽，流去的水不会再回转。”
    “阿妈！你说的是甚么？”儿子更不解了。
    就像又出太阳又下雨一般，老人在抽噎中带着微笑：“没有甚么，快进去瞄瞄你的胖儿子，长得和你一模一样。”
    他们走进医院，那?颇汉子一手抱着襁褓，一手扬起乌黑的钢。他笑了，笑得像松涛一样的豪放。
    老大妈祝福道：“快长着硬翅飞吧！我的小鸟！”她又眺望窗外，只见一簇簇，一丛丛的红花，正颤动着火一样的光芒，朝自己微笑。
