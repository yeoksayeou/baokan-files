Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 1st: Today, on the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the entire city of Tianjin is jubilant. 300,000 people held a grand celebration parade, reporting to the motherland the glorious achievements of Tianjin on all fronts over the past ten years.

At 10:00 AM, a celebration meeting was held in the central square. Li Gengtao, the mayor of Tianjin, delivered a speech. He pointed out that Tianjin, during these great ten years, has developed into a socialist industrial base with a considerable scale of metallurgy, machinery and electronics, chemical industry, textile industry, and light industry. The city's total industrial output value has increased more than twelvefold in the past ten years, and the grain output of all counties has increased by nearly one and a half times. He called on the people of the city to unite more closely under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the General Line, and to advance bravely.

The parade celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China then began. A five-star red flag, fluttering in the wind, led the parade, marching mightily along the Haihe River. A team of 80,000 industrial workers passed by, shouting slogans such as "Strive to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year," and "Long live the Great Leap Forward." Amidst the earth-shattering sound of gongs and drums, a huge three-dimensional model of "Carp Leaping Over the Dragon Gate" appeared, with workers straddling the carp, holding high a golden banner with the words: Tianjin's total industrial output value has increased more than twelvefold in the past ten years.

The steelworkers, who are bravely fighting to produce 12 million tons of steel, marched by. The workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant marched proudly in the parade; their daily steel production now exceeds the city's annual steel production during the Kuomintang rule. The steelworkers also held up a huge chart, with a red arrow more than three zhang long pointing to an amazing number: the city's steel production has increased seventy-one times in ten years. Workers from the tractor factory drove their self-made tractors and cars.

When the peasant team passed by, cheers of "Long Live the People's Commune" resounded over the square. The various objects, models, and charts held by the peasants reflected their soaring enthusiasm in the Great Leap Forward.

At the end of the parade, thousands of people on both sides of the Haihe River enthusiastically cheered the great achievements of the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and cheered "Long live the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

The Soviet Youth Delegation from Novosibirsk, who were visiting Tianjin, and Soviet experts and Polish staff in Tianjin, were invited to attend the ceremony.

    海河两岸群众欢呼十年成就
    天津举行盛大庆祝游行
    据新华社天津1日电　在伟大建国十周年的今天，天津全市欢腾。有三十万人举行了盛大的庆祝游行，向祖国汇报了十年来天津各条战线上的辉煌成就。
    十时，在中心广场举行了庆祝大会。天津市市长李耕涛讲了话。他指出，天津市在这伟大的十年间已经发展成为冶金、机电、化工、纺织、轻工业等工业都有相当规模的社会主义工业基地。全市工业总产值十年来增加了十二倍多，各县粮食产量增加了近一倍半。他号召全市人民在党的领导下，在总路线光辉照耀下，更加紧密地团结起来，奋勇前进。
    庆祝建国十周年的游行接着开始。一面迎风招展的五星红旗，引导着游行队伍沿着海河浩浩荡荡地向前行进。八万名产业工人组成的队伍过来了，他们高呼着“为今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗”、“大跃进万岁”的口号向前行进。在惊天动地的锣鼓声中出现了一幅
  “鲤鱼跳龙门”的巨大立体模型，横跨在鲤鱼身上的工人高举着一面金字大旗，旗上写着：十年来天津市的工业总产值增长了十二倍多。
    正在为生产一千二百万吨钢而英勇奋战的钢铁工人的队伍过来了。天津钢厂的工人豪迈地在队伍中行进，他们现在一天生产的钢就超过了国民党统治时期全市一年的钢产量。钢铁工人们还举着一个巨大的图表，上面是一支三丈多长的红色箭头，指向一个惊人的数字：全市钢的产量在十年里增加了七十一倍。拖拉机制造厂的工人，今天开来了他们自制的拖拉机、小轿车。
    当农民队伍过来的时候，“人民公社万岁”的欢呼声响彻广场的上空。农民们举着的各种实物、模型和图表，反映了他们在大跃进中的冲天干劲。
    游行结束的时候，海河两岸的万千群众热烈欢呼建国十年来的伟大成就，欢呼中国共产党和毛主席万岁！
    应邀前来天津访问的苏联新西伯利亚市青年代表团和在天津的苏联专家、波兰工作人员等应邀出席观礼。
