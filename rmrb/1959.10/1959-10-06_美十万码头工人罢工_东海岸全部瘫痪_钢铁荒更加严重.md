Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch from New York: 100,000 dockworkers on the US East Coast went on strike on the 1st of October to demand higher wages and contract revisions, paralyzing all American ports along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts.

Currently, 190 steamships are frozen in New York Harbor alone; rail freight to these ports has ceased. This strike, launched by members of the International Longshoremen's Association, is stifling more than $700 million in import and export trade each month for these ports. The impact is particularly severe, greatly reducing steel imports at a time when the United States is experiencing a steel shortage. Since the U.S. steelworkers' strike began, imported steel has accounted for one-fifth of the national steel supply; now, four of the five major ports for imported steel are paralyzed.

The New York Board of Trade telegraphed U.S. President Eisenhower on the 2nd, urging him to take action to end this "national emergency."

According to Western news agencies, the number of workers currently on strike and those laid off due to the impact of the strike in the United States has exceeded one million. In addition to the 500,000 steelworkers who are continuing their strike, there are also workers in the non-ferrous metals industry, shipbuilding and repair industry, and meatpacking industry who are striking.

### 美十万码头工人罢工  东海岸全部瘫痪　钢铁荒更加严重

    美十万码头工人罢工
    东海岸全部瘫痪　钢铁荒更加严重
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：美国东海岸十万码头工人为提高工资改订合同于1日举行大罢工，罢工使大西洋和墨西哥湾沿岸的美国港口全部瘫痪。
    目前，仅在纽约港就有一百九十条火轮船被冻结；通往这些港口的铁路货运已经停止。美国国际码头工人联合会会员举行的这一次罢工，窒息了这些港口每月总额在七亿美元以上的进出口贸易。其中影响特别严重的是在美国闹钢铁荒的时候大大减少了钢材进口量。自美国钢铁工人举行大罢工以来，进口钢材占美国全国钢材供应量的五分之一；而现在，进口钢材的五个主要港口中，已有四个陷于瘫痪。
    纽约商业局已在2日打电报给美国总统艾森豪威尔，要他采取行动，结束这一“全国性的紧急状态”。
    据西方通讯社报道，到现在为止，美国正在罢工和受罢工影响而停工的工人已超过一百万人。目前在坚持罢工的除五十万钢铁工人外，还有有色金属工业、船舶修理业和肉类工业的工人。
