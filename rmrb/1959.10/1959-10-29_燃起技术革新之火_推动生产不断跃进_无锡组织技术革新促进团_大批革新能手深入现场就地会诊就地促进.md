    Ignite the Flame of Technological Innovation and Promote Continuous Advances in Production
    Wuxi Organizes a Technological Innovation Promotion Group
    A Large Number of Innovation Experts Going Deep into the Field for On-Site Consultations and Promotion

    (Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th) The city of Wuxi has organized a thousand-member technological innovation promotion group to go down to factories to ignite the "innovation" flame, sparking a massive new upsurge in technological innovation. From September to the first half of October, 284 factories in the city achieved more than 4,500 relatively important inventions and improvements, greatly boosting the city's industrial production.

    This year, Wuxi's technological innovation movement has achieved great results, but development between factories is very uneven, especially in some small and new factories, where progress is relatively poor. Therefore, in September, the Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party selected a group of technological innovation experts, veteran workers, technicians, and cadres from some large factories to form a technological innovation promotion group to help carry out the technological innovation movement in some small and newly built factories in the urban area and its subordinate counties and districts, achieving remarkable results. In early October, in order to further set off a larger upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy throughout the city, the Municipal Party Committee organized a larger-scale technological innovation promotion group.

    Whenever the promotion group arrives at a factory, it operates under the leadership of the Party organization of the unit, relying on the masses to carry out activities centered on current production. They not only listen to reports from factory cadres and read summary materials, but also go deep into the field to observe, inspect products, tools, equipment, operating techniques, and other conditions, and hold Zhuge Liang meetings with workers to find solutions and offer ideas. According to incomplete statistics from four industries and three districts, 378 such Zhuge Liang meetings were held, proposing more than 1,300 suggestions. Some of the technological innovation pioneers participating in the promotion group also introduced their experiences in daring to think and act and breaking down superstitions, and held on-site operating demonstrations.

    The promotion group first played a significant role in summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. When the metallurgical system promotion group inspected the coking plant, it affirmed their achievements in innovation in coal washing and coking, and at the same time pointed out that semi-mechanization and mechanization could be further implemented in transportation and kiln loading using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to improve labor efficiency. Aiming at the major production key point of unstable quality after the new cotton was put into production, the textile system promotion group concentrated the experience and lessons learned from various textile factories in trial spinning of new cotton, and set up "experimental fields" in the Shenxin Textile Factory. After obtaining experience, it was promoted in textile factories throughout the city, which generally reduced the yarn breakage rate by about half.

    The technological innovation promotion group is also an ideological promotion group, and their activities have greatly promoted the anti-rightist and all-out-effort to increase production and practice economy in various factories.

    燃起技术革新之火　推动生产不断跃进
    无锡组织技术革新促进团
    大批革新能手深入现场就地会诊就地促进
    本报南京28日电　无锡市组织千人技术革新促进团，下厂点燃“革新”之火，掀起了声势浩大的技术革新新高潮。从9月份到10月上半月，全市二百八十四家工厂实现了较重要的创造和改进达四千五百多件，促使全市工业生产大大高涨。
    今年以来，无锡市技术革新运动取得了很大成绩，但厂与厂之间发展很不平衡，特别是有些小厂和新厂，开展得较差。因此，中共无锡市委9月份从部分大厂中抽调了一批技术革新能手，老工人、技术人员和干部，组成技术革新促进团，到市区和所属县区的部分小厂和新建厂中帮助开展技术革新运动，取得了显著效果。10月上旬，为了进一步在全市掀起增产节约的更大高潮，市委又组织了规模更大的技术革新促进团。
    促进团每到一个工厂，就在本单位党组织的领导下，依靠群众围绕当前生产开展活动。他们不但听取厂内干部汇报、阅读总结材料，而且深入现场观察，检查产品、工具设备、操作技术等情况，并和工人一道开诸葛亮会，找窍门，出主意。据四个产业和三个区的不完全统计，这种诸葛亮会就召开了三百七十八次，提出建议一千三百多条。有些参加促进团的技术革新闯将，还介绍了自己敢想敢为、破除迷信的体会，在现场举行操作表演。
    促进团首先在总结和推广先进经验方面起了很大作用。冶金系统促进团到炼焦厂检查时，肯定了他们在洗煤、炼焦方面革新的成绩，同时又指出可以在运输和装窑等方面进一步用土洋结合的办法实行半机械化和机械化，以提高劳动效率。纺织系统促进团针对新棉上车后质量不够稳定的重大生产关键，集中各纺织厂试纺新棉的经验教训，在申新纺织厂搞“试验田”，得出经验以后，就在全市纺织厂推广，使棉纱断头率普遍降低一半左右。
    技术革新促进团同时也是思想促进团，他们的活动，大大推动了各厂反右倾鼓干劲的增产节约运动。
