Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 4th October: The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant has already overfulfilled this year's gross output value and cost plan ahead of schedule in September. The scrap rate has been greatly reduced, and the plant has increased production and saved more than 230,000 yuan for the state. At present, the plant's employees are working hard to complete this year's product variety plan and are preparing for larger-scale production next year.

The plant conscientiously implemented the Party's instructions on opposing right-leaning tendencies, encouraging hard work, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy. The employees further developed their enthusiasm and tried every means to overcome various difficulties, so that the production level improved every ten days. Half of the ninety-eight tools of seven kinds in the September plan were manufactured in advance in August, creating conditions for completing the annual plan one quarter and twenty days ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th October: Chemical industry workers in Zhejiang Province dedicated a generous gift to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country. By September 25, they had completed the annual production plans for twelve kinds of chemical products ahead of schedule, including nitric acid, potassium sulfate fertilizer, barium polysulfide, water glass, ammonium nitrate explosives, rickshaw tires, sodium acetate, barite, medicinal baking soda, calcium carbide, and adhesive plaster powder. The output of these products has greatly exceeded last year's level, with nitric acid production increasing by twenty-one times compared to last year.

Since the beginning of this year, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, employees on the chemical industry front in Zhejiang Province have launched a wave of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced. Pesticide factories in Jiaxing, Ningbo, and other places carried out linked competitions. In less than half a month in August, they produced more than 500 tons of barium polysulfide pesticide, exceeding the production volume before August. In the competition, each factory made great efforts to comprehensively utilize raw materials, vigorously save and recover, actively reduce raw material consumption quotas, and fully tap the potential of raw materials, thereby ensuring the supply of raw materials.

    洛阳矿山机器厂完成全年总产值计划
    浙江十二种化工产品完成全年任务
    新华社洛阳4日电　洛阳矿山机器厂已在9月份提前超额完成今年的总产值和成本计划，废品率大大降低，已为国家增产节约二十三万余元。现在全厂职工一方面在努力完成今年的产品品种计划，一方面在为明年更大规模的生产作准备。
    这个厂认真贯彻党的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的指示，职工们进一步发挥了积极性，千方百计地克服种种困难，使生产水平一旬比一旬提高，把9月份计划中的七种九十八件工具，提前在8月制造好一半，为提前一季又二十天完成年计划创造了条件。
    新华社杭州4日电　浙江省化学工业职工向建国十周年献出厚礼，到9月25日，已提前完成了硝酸、硫酸钾肥、多硫化钡、泡化碱、硝铵炸药、力车外胎、醋酸钠、重晶石、药用小苏打、钙克司、胶布粉等十二种化工产品全年的生产计划。这些产品的产量都大大超过去年的水平，其中硝酸产量比去年增长二十一倍。
    今年以来，浙江省化工战线上的职工在总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进、超先进的热潮。嘉兴、宁波等地农药厂开展挂钩竞赛，8月份不到半个月时间，就突击生产了多硫化钡农药五百多吨，超过8月份以前的生产数量。在竞赛中，各厂大搞原料综合利用，大力节约回收，积极降低原料消耗定额，充分发掘原料潜力，因而保证了原料供应。（附图片）
