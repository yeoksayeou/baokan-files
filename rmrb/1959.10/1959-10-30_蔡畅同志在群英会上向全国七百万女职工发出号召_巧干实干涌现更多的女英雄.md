Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, delivered a speech at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade, entitled "Female Workers Should Become More Advanced Producers."

After elaborating on the current surging mass movement on all production and construction fronts in our country, Cai Chang said that female workers are a strong force in the working class. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the number of female workers has surged to more than seven million, more than ten times the number before liberation. The first generation of industrial female workers has also emerged in some minority areas with backward economies in the past. A large number of employees’ families have taken up social labor positions. Now, the scope of female workers’ labor has been unprecedentedly expanded. Female workers work side by side with male workers in all positions of national production and construction. They have completely broken the inferiority and dependence thoughts left to women by the old society for thousands of years, and carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. With the heroic spirit of "women can do everything, and they can do everything well," they have made outstanding contributions in all aspects. The number of advanced figures among female workers is also unprecedentedly increasing. There are 796 women representatives at this grand gathering of heroes. Among them, there are advanced figures who have been present for ten years without absence and have always overfulfilled their tasks; there are red banner bearers who constantly invent and create and always stay ahead of time; there are heroes who are not afraid of sacrifice to protect national property; there are advanced workers who work hard and serve diligently; there are old models who are enthusiastic about helping others; there are skilled workers among new apprentices; there are engineering and technical personnel who are both red and expert; there are backbones who actively create and develop medium-sized and small enterprises and community-run industries; and there are model employees’ families. The tremendous changes of female workers and the glorious deeds of these advanced figures not only fully demonstrate that under the leadership of the Party, women's contribution to socialist construction is increasing day by day, but also profoundly reflect the new face of the rapid development of socialist construction in our country. In the future, with the continuous high-speed development of our country's construction cause, more and more women will become workers, and more and more will get rid of heavy manual labor and become laborers with high cultural and technical knowledge. This is the bright future of women in our country, and it is also an inevitable result of the development of socialist cause in our country.

Cai Chang then said that in order to achieve new victories in socialist construction, we must first continue to improve our communist consciousness, further carry forward the communist style of not being afraid of difficulties, not talking about conditions, and being selfless, and work heroically to build socialism at a high speed. Since the Great Leap Forward, not for fame, not for profit, everything for socialism has become the action slogan of the vast number of male and female workers and their families. The communist style of giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself is constantly being carried forward. Continuing to carry forward this spirit is an important guarantee for the victory of our country's construction cause. Advanced collectives and advanced male and female producers should further play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridge role in this regard. The more arduous the labor, the more we regard it as a glorious and heroic cause, take the lead in breaking through difficulties, and win victories. Advanced producers must be determined to go wherever they go and plant the red flag there; to ensure that there are no backward people next to them.

In order to achieve new victories in socialist construction, we must also continue to break superstitions, liberate our minds, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work, implement technological innovation and technological revolution, and improve labor productivity. We must study hard and diligently, and carry out innovation and creation boldly, conscientiously, and meticulously. We must also adhere to learning according to our own cultural level and work needs, strive to improve our cultural and scientific knowledge, and strive to improve our technology. Advanced producers should be the backbone and leaders of technological innovation and technological revolution. We must combine personal creation with collective wisdom, lead the broad masses, and launch a more extensive and in-depth technological innovation and technological revolution movement to promote the continued leap forward of socialist construction.

Cai Chang said that the Party teaches us that in order to ensure sustained enthusiasm and continuous leap forward, we must also arrange our lives well. Here, arranging family life is an important aspect. Reducing housework and ensuring the rest and study of employees are not only the urgent requirements of female employees, but also a major issue related to the lives of all male and female employees, and it is also necessary to further liberate labor force and develop social production at a high speed. Therefore, we must strive to promote the gradual socialization of housework and run social welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries well while promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. To run these undertakings well, we need the support of factories and mines, and at the same time, we must rely on the strength of the broad masses. Whether it is running collective life and welfare undertakings or arranging family life, we must implement the principle of diligence and thrift, learn to live, make careful calculations, and make long-term plans.

Cai Chang finally called on all female workers to resolutely oppose right-leaning opportunism together with male workers, defend the Party's general line, make persistent efforts, continue to move forward, complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the country in a faster, better, and more economical way, and strive for more female workers to become advanced producers.

    蔡畅同志在群英会上向全国七百万女职工发出号召
    巧干实干涌现更多的女英雄
    新华社29日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅，29日在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上以“女职工同志们要更多地成为先进生产者”为题，作了讲话。
    蔡畅在阐述了当前我国各条生产建设战线上，群众运动汹涌澎湃的形势以后说，女职工是工人阶级队伍中一支强大的力量。1958年以来，随着生产的大跃进，女职工人数猛增到七百多万，比解放前增加了十倍多。过去经济落后的少数民族地区也出现了第一代产业女工。大批职工家属走上社会劳动的岗位。现在，女职工的劳动范围已经空前扩大，在国家生产建设的各个岗位上，都有女职工同男职工一起并肩劳动。她们彻底打破了几千年来旧社会遗留给妇女的自卑依赖思想，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，以“妇女什么也能干，什么也能干得好”的英雄气魄，在各方面作出了出色的贡献。女职工中的先进人物也是空前增多，在这个盛大的群英会上就有七百九十六名妇女代表。其中，有十年不缺勤、一直超额完成任务的先进人物；有不断发明创造永远走在时间前边的红旗手；有为保卫国家财产、奋不顾身的英雄；有埋头苦干、辛勤服务的先进工作者；有热心帮助别人的老模范；有新徒工中的技术能手；有又红又专的工程技术人员；有积极创办和发展中、小型企业和社办工业的骨干；还有模范的职工家属。女职工的巨大变化和这些先进人物的光荣事迹，不但充分地说明了在党的领导下，妇女对社会主义建设的贡献日益增大，而且也深刻地反映了我国社会主义建设迅速发展的新面貌。今后随着我国建设事业的不断高速度发展，妇女将越来越多地成为工人，将越来越多地摆脱笨重的手工劳动，成为具有高度文化和技术知识的劳动者。这是我国妇女的光明前途，也是我国社会主义事业发展的必然结果。
    蔡畅接着说，为着取得社会主义建设的新胜利，我们首先要继续提高共产主义觉悟，进一步发扬不怕困难，不讲条件，忘我无私的共产主义风格，为高速度地建设社会主义英勇劳动。大跃进以来，不为名，不为利，一切为了社会主义，已经成为广大男女职工和职工家属的行动口号。把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己的共产主义风格，正在不断发扬。继续发扬这种精神，是我国建设事业获得胜利的重要保证。先进集体和男女先进生产者，更要在这方面进一步发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。越是艰苦的劳动，我们就越把它看成光荣豪迈的事业，带头突破困难，夺取胜利。先进生产者要决心做到走到那里，就把红旗插到那里；做到自己的旁边，没有落后的人。
    为着取得社会主义建设的新胜利，我们还要继续破除迷信，解放思想，发扬不断革命的精神，把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，实行技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动生产率。要苦钻苦学，要又大胆、又认真、又细致地进行革新和创造。我们还必须根据自己的文化水平和工作需要，坚持学习，努力提高文化、科学知识，努力提高技术。先进生产者要做技术革新和技术革命的骨干和带头人。要把个人的创造和集体的智慧结合起来，带动广大群众，掀起一个更广泛、更深入的技术革新和技术革命运动，促进社会主义建设事业的继续跃进。
    蔡畅说，党教导我们，为了保证持久的干劲，不断的跃进，还必须安排好生活。这里，安排好家庭生活是一个重要的方面。减轻家务劳动，保证职工的休息和学习，不仅是女职工的迫切要求，也是关系男女全体职工生活的大事，更是进一步解放劳动力，高速度发展社会生产所必需的。因此我们必须在生产大跃进的同时，努力促进家务劳动逐步社会化，办好公共食堂、托儿所等社会生活福利事业。办好这些事业，需要厂矿企业的支持，同时还要依靠广大群众的力量。不论是举办集体生活福利事业，或者是安排家庭生活，都要贯彻勤俭的原则，学会过日子，精打细算，细水长流。
    蔡畅最后号召全体女职工，应当同男职工一道，坚决反对右倾机会主义，保卫党的总路线，再接再厉，不断前进，多快好省地完成党和国家交给我们的任务，争取有更多的女职工成为先进生产者。
