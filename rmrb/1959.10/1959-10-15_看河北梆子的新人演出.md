　　Watching the Newcomers Perform Hebei Bangzi Opera
　　Ren Guilin
    Recently, the joint performance of Hebei Bangzi opera by the Hebei Provincial Youth Leap Forward Troupe, the Tianjin Little Hundred Flowers Troupe, and the Beijing Bangzi Training Class is truly a wonderful gift dedicated to the National Day. Everyone unanimously praises these rising stars, applauds the performances of these newcomers, and rejoices in the rebirth of Hebei Bangzi opera.
    Ten years ago, Hebei Bangzi was on the verge of extinction, facing death, with only one professional troupe remaining in the entire province; now, there are more than twenty troupes in the province, and amateur troupes are countless, what a great change.
    Ten years ago, only a few veteran artists were left in Tianjin. According to Comrade Han Junqing, the average age of the actors in their troupe was fifty-six. Now, Tianjin is training more than five hundred young actors, what a great change.
    Ten years ago, Beijing Bangzi (i.e., Hebei Bangzi), which was once very popular in Beijing, was squeezed out of Beijing and nearly disappeared. Now, a new force has grown up, what a great change.
    Where does this change come from? The artists deeply realize that it is due to the correctness of the Party's literary and artistic policy, and deeply feel the leading role of the Party. They compare the Party to a good doctor, with miraculous hands that bring the dead back to life, and the facts are exactly like this.
    This is a group of young people advancing on the road of becoming both red and expert. They have undergone rigorous training, studied hard and practiced diligently, and have thus achieved superb and skilled levels in performing arts.
    "Blocking the Horse" and "Du Shiniang" are performed by the Youth Leap Forward Troupe. The dance and fight between Jiao Guangpu and Yang Ba Jie in "Blocking the Horse" has reached a high degree of accuracy and refinement. This performance of "Du Shiniang" is even more wonderful, delicate, and touching. From the script to the performance, music, and singing, there has been a great improvement, and it is simply a mature artistic masterpiece.
    "Broken Bridge" is performed by the Little Hundred Flowers Troupe. I also watched their performances of "Qin Qiong Observing the Battle" and "Garden Offering Pearls," which were all very good. "Observing the Battle" was originally an excellent Hebei Bangzi opera, but it has been discontinued for many years and is almost lost. It is very important to inherit it now. The performance is also very good, with singing and dancing demonstrating skillful artistry. I have also seen the Little Hundred Flowers Troupe perform the new play "Xun Guan Niang," which successfully shaped the stage image of an ancient thirteen-year-old heroine.
    "Qin Xianglian" is performed by the Bangzi Training Class. When Bao Wenzheng and Qin Xianglian sing at the top of their voices, it is truly like the loud sound of a great bell, shaking people's hearts, with the spirit of generous and tragic songs of Yan and Zhao.
    When these three Bangzi troupes perform together, they also give people a feeling that, especially in terms of music and singing, each has its own characteristics and different artistic styles. I think this is very necessary. Within the same opera genre, there should also be a hundred flowers blooming, with multiple schools, learning from each other and competing with each other, to meet the cultural needs of the broad masses of people.
    The people of Hebei love Hebei Bangzi very much. I remember when I was young, returning home from school in the evening, I often heard farmers hoeing back home, singing a few lines of Bangzi opera by the fields and on the streets. Now, in order to better serve the working people and better inherit and promote the excellent heritage of Hebei Bangzi, these young comrades shoulder a heavy responsibility.

### 看河北梆子的新人演出

　　看河北梆子的新人演出
　　任桂林
    最近，河北省青年跃进剧团、天津市小百花剧团、北京市梆子学习班联合演出的河北梆子，真是向国庆献出的一份好礼物。大家一致称赞这些后起之秀，同声为这些新人的演出喝采，为河北梆子的新生而高兴。
    十年前，河北梆子濒于绝境，面临着死亡，全省只剩下一个职业剧团；现在，全省有了二十多个剧团，群众业余剧团更是千百计，多么大的变化。
    十年前，天津市只剩下少数老艺人，据韩俊卿同志讲，她们剧团演员的平均年龄是五十六岁。现在，天津市正培养着五百多青年演员，多么大的变化。
    十年前，曾在北京盛极一时的京梆子（即河北梆子），被挤出京去，近于绝迹。现在，一支新生力军成长起来了，多么大的变化。
    这变化由何而起，艺人们深深地体会到是党的文艺方针的正确，深深感受到是党的领导作用，他们把党比做良医，妙手回春，起死回生，事实也恰是这样。
    这是一批向着又红又专的道路前进的青年人。他们经过了严格的训练，勤学苦练，因而在表演艺术上达到了精湛熟练的程度。
    “挡马”、“杜十娘”是青年跃进剧团演出的。“挡马”的焦光普和杨八姐的对舞对打，达到了高度准确和精练的地步。“杜十娘”这次的演出更精采更细腻更感人，从剧本到表演和音乐唱腔，都提高了一大步，简直是一件成熟的艺术精品了。
    “断桥”是小百花剧团演出的，我还看了他们演出的“秦琼观阵”、“花园赠珠”，都很好。“观阵”本是河北梆子的优秀剧目，却多年停演，近于失传，现在继承下来，十分重要。演的也很好，边歌边舞，俱见功夫。我还看过小百花剧团演出的新剧目“荀灌娘”，把一个古代十三岁的女英雄的舞台形象，成功地塑造出来了。
    “秦香莲”是梆子学习班演出的。当包文正和秦香莲引吭高歌的时候，真如黄钟大吕的洪声，震动人心，有燕赵慷慨悲歌的气概。
    这三个梆子团在一起演出的时候，还给人一种感觉，特别是在音乐唱腔方面，各有特色，各有不同的艺术风格，我看这是很必要的。在同一个剧种里，也应该是百花齐放，多种流派，既相互学习，又相互竞赛，满足广大人民的文化生活的需要。
    河北人民是非常喜爱河北梆子的。我记得幼年时傍晚放学回家，常听到农民们荷锄归来，在田边，在街头，总要唱两口梆子腔。现在，要更好地为劳动人民服务，更好地把河北梆子的优秀遗产继承和发扬起来，这些青年同志们是负有重任的。
