　　How much manure does a pig produce in a year?
    According to experiments in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, which is famous throughout the country for pig farming, a fattened pig weighing 120 jin can produce about 80 dan of manure and urine per year; a sow weighing 120 jin can produce about 120 dan of manure and urine per year. If calculated based on the average of pigs of all sizes, a pig can produce more than 40 dan of manure and urine per year. According to experiments by farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai, the manure and urine of one pig is equivalent to 60 jin of chemical fertilizer. It is very reasonable to compare a pig to a small “chemical fertilizer factory.” This living "small fertilizer factory" can be "established" in every commune, production team, canteen, and household. It has low cost, quick results, and great profits, providing meat, money, and fertilizer for the fields. Why not do it!
    Pig manure contains a large amount of organic matter, and the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that plants particularly need. Every 100 jin of pig manure contains 1.24 jin of these elements. Applying pig manure to crops has a significant effect on loosening the soil, strengthening roots, promoting seedling growth, and increasing grain plumpness. In Diangu Village, Wangshi Commune, Qingfeng County, Henan Province, due to the annual development of pig farming and the continuous increase in fertilizer application to cultivated land, coupled with other yield-increasing measures, grain production has increased year by year. In 1954, when there was no pig farming, the average grain yield per mu was 157 jin; in 1955, with 15 pigs raised and 4 cartloads of fertilizer applied per mu, the average yield was 187 jin; in 1956, with 75 pigs raised and 6 cartloads of fertilizer applied per mu, the average yield was 206 jin; in 1957, with 248 pigs raised and 8 cartloads of fertilizer applied per mu, the average yield was 267 jin; in 1958, with 357 pigs raised and 12 cartloads of fertilizer applied per mu, the average yield was 413 jin; this year, with 365 pigs raised, 11 cartloads of base fertilizer and 8 cartloads of top dressing fertilizer were applied per mu, the average corn yield per mu was 500 jin. More pigs, more grain - it's very obvious!
    Having more pigs does not necessarily mean accumulating more manure, because many places do not pay attention to manure accumulation, resulting in a large loss of fertilizer. Therefore, pig raising must have pens, and one must be diligent in adding bedding and removing manure; manure pits or manure pools should be covered to prevent sunshine and rain from reducing fertilizer effectiveness. Some people think that pigs grow slowly when they are penned up, but this is an unfounded statement.

### 一头猪一年积多少肥？

　　一头猪一年积多少肥？
    根据养猪闻名全国的湖南望城县的试验，一头重一百二十斤的肥猪，每年可产粪尿八十来担；一头重一百二十斤的母猪，每年可产粪尿一百二十担左右；若以大小猪平均计算，一头猪一年可产粪尿四十担以上。据上海郊区农民的试验，一头猪的粪尿相当六十斤化学肥料。人们把一头猪比作是一座小小的“化肥厂”是很有道理的。这种活的“小化肥厂”，在每一个公社、生产队、食堂以及家家户户都可以“兴办”，它的成本小、收效快、获利大，又吃肉、又卖钱、又肥田，何乐而不为！
    猪粪含有大量的有机物质，植物所特别需要的氮、磷、钾，在每百斤的猪粪中含有一点二四斤。猪粪施于农作物，对松土、培根、长苗架、壮籽实都有显著的作用。河南清丰县王什公社点固大队，由于养猪事业逐年发展，耕地施肥量不断增加，再加上其它增产措施，粮食产量年年上升。1954年没有养猪，每亩平均产粮食一百五十七斤；1955年养猪十五头，每亩施肥四车，平均亩产一百八十七斤；1956年养猪七十五头，每亩施肥六车，平均亩产二百零六斤；1957年养猪二百四十八头，每亩施肥八车，平均亩产二百六十七斤；1958年养猪三百五十七头，每亩施肥十二车，平均亩产四百一十三斤；今年养猪三百六十五头，每亩施底肥十一车，追肥八车、玉米平均亩产五百斤。猪多粮丰，非常明显！
    猪多，并不等于积肥多，这是因为许多地方不注意积肥，以至大量的肥料流失了。所以养猪必须有栏圈，要勤垫勤取；积肥坑或积肥池要加盖，以免日晒雨淋减低肥效。有些人认为猪圈起来长得慢，这是没有根据的说法。
