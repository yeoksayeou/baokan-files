    The Rapid Development of New China's Film Industry
    Huang Mou
    I
    Film is a young art in China, with only over fifty years of history. These fifty years have been a very tortuous and complex road, but with the progress of China's revolutionary history, it has finally embarked on a broad and bright avenue.
    From the first screening of a film in Shanghai in 1896, it became a tool for imperialism, bureaucrats, and comprador bourgeoisie to pursue profits. However, after the May Fourth Movement, the new cultural force led by the Chinese proletariat raised the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and film also joined this large-scale and fierce battle, becoming an important part of the left-wing cultural movement. Under the leadership and influence of the Party, a number of excellent films were produced, such as "Song of the Fishermen," "The Ordeal of the Peach and Plum," "Street Angel," "Crossroads," "Eight Hundred Heroes," "Defend Our Land," "Storm on the Border," "The Spring River Flows East," "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes," "On the Songhua River," and "Hope in the World." These films were all made in very difficult circumstances, breaking through all kinds of persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries. These films enthusiastically exposed the evils under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, and reflected the people's desire for democracy, freedom, and liberation, thus gaining the welcome and love of the broad masses. At the same time, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, film work was also carried out in the liberated areas under extremely difficult conditions. Therefore, Chinese film has a long revolutionary tradition.
    However, under the aggression of imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, film, as a modern and complex enterprise, had a strong semi-colonial nature in terms of production, distribution, screening, and technology, and was very backward. The film market in old China had always been monopolized by films from imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain. The eight major Hollywood companies had their agents in major cities in China, who controlled most of the screening systems in most cities across the country, screening two to three hundred American and British films in China every year. By the time of the national liberation in 1949, there were only 596 cinemas in such a large country as China. Moreover, most of the cinemas were concentrated in some large cities along the rivers and coasts. From the film stock for film production to all the equipment for photography, processing, and screening, everything had to rely entirely on imports from abroad. As for the film studios, they were all dilapidated, and various technical equipment was old and incomplete. Therefore, at the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the film industry started construction from scratch.
    II
    Film production—film art creation—is the soul of the entire film industry. Film is the most popular art to educate the people with socialist and communist ideas. The various genres of film art—feature films, newsreels, science education films, and animation films—all have their own different forms and characteristics, and influence the broad masses in many ways. Therefore, the development and prosperity of film art creation is always the most fundamental and central issue in the film industry.
    During the War of Liberation, many filmmakers overcame various difficulties and sent their own snipers to the front lines of the War of Liberation to shoot newsreels, and some comrades even sacrificed their lives. In 1949, the first feature film, "The Bridge," was produced. This was the first time that the Chinese working class appeared on the screen no longer as an oppressed, exploited, and pitied image, but as a liberated master! This film was welcomed by the broad masses.
    This was a good start, opening a historically significant new page in the history of New China's film! And the feature films produced in 1950, such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "Daughter of China," "Zhao Yiman," and "Red Flag on Emerald Hill," as well as newsreels such as "A Million Heroes Cross the Yangtze River" and "Red Flags Sweep the Northwest," laid an unshakable foundation for the direction of film art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The vivid images of strong and unyielding fighting figures created in films such as "The White-Haired Girl" and "Daughter of China" under the rule of imperialism and feudal reaction, as well as the glory of new heroic figures in various struggles, illuminate the path of our film art creation! The correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policy has once again been confirmed by the achievements of film art.
    However, at that time, there were still some filmmakers who had not truly established the idea of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. After liberation, they still had many worries and doubts about film depicting the struggles and lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they could not realize the importance of ideological transformation. The Party gave us a timely warning. The criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the literary and artistic rectification campaign put forward the task of educating the people with the ideology of the working class and launched a resolute struggle against bourgeois reactionary ideology. After this struggle, the film industry became more clear about the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Facts have also proved that after liberation, the broad masses of the Chinese people longed to understand the rich history of revolutionary struggles in the past few decades and how New China was gloriously born in arduous struggles. Some films reflecting the Chinese armed revolutionary struggles and underground struggles that have been produced in the past ten years, such as "Daughter of China," "Steel Warrior," "Zhao Yiman," "Red Flag on Emerald Hill," "Southward Battles," "Reconnaissance Across the River," "Chicken Feather Letter," "Guerrillas on the Plain," "Dong Cunrui," "Mother," "Shangganling," "The Fifth Watch," "Daughter of the Party," "Red Children," "The Eternal Radio Wave," "Iron Window Inferno," "Sea Soul," etc., have all been warmly welcomed by the broad masses. The vivid and distinct images of revolutionary heroes in many films often become a force to inspire the people, especially the younger generation, to engage in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and a model for them to emulate.
    According to the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, our film creation strives for diversification in subject matter, form, and style, and has also produced many excellent films such as "The Butterfly Lovers," "The Heavenly Match," "Qin Xianglian," "Hassen and Gamila," "Flowers of the Motherland," "Song Jingshi," "For Peace," "Silent Mountains," "Beacon Fire on the Border," "Woman Basketball Player No. 5," and "Blessing." In 1958, some excellent documentary feature films such as "Song of the Reservoir," "Huang Baomei," and "Beside the March 8th River" were also produced. This is a new style, a reportage in feature films, and a product of the great leap forward in film creation. This will make it more possible for feature film creation to quickly reflect the great leap forward and produce more realistic works. The new film exhibition for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1959 is like a vivid picture scroll of nearly a hundred years of history, showing how rich and complex the life struggles and character personalities are. From "Lin Zexu," "The Storm," "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," "Song of Youth," "Musician Nie Er," "The Lin Family Shop," "Sea Eagle," "Ice Sisters" to "The East Wind Prevails," the subject matter is so broad, and the forms and styles are so rich and diverse. Moreover, films such as "The Old Soldier's New Story," "Steel Family," "Spring Comes to the World," and "Oasis Triumph Song" have made gratifying achievements in creating new heroic images in construction!
    The great victory of New China's ten years of construction has also been fully expressed on the screen through newsreels. If the victory of the Chinese revolution once again revealed a new page in history that shocked the world, then newsreels are the most powerful testimony to this history.
    The brave and hardworking Chinese people, under the leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, are building New China at a flying speed. Every step forward in our great motherland has left clear, true, and moving footprints in newsreels!
    Over the past ten years, newsreels have created many excellent films, such as the long documentary "A Million Heroes Cross the Yangtze River," "Liberated China" co-produced with the Soviet Union, "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Resist America, Aid Korea," "We Must Repair the Huai River Well," "Moving Mountains and Filling the Sea," "Under the Illumination of the General Line," "Suppressing the Rebellion in Tibet," "A Million Serfs Stand Up," "The Tenth Spring," and "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness," short documentaries such as "Exchange of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War," "Eternal Friendship," "Heroes Rush to Repair the Yellow River Iron Bridge," "Qi Baishi," and "Clay Figure Zhang," etc.
    Newsreels have established their fine tradition over the past ten years: they are the snipers who are always at the forefront of our art, and the most sensitive tentacles to explore the beating pulse of the motherland's progress. They record the new people and new things they have seen with their own eyes truthfully and vividly, revealing the truth of the great history of the motherland's progress to the people of the world. For newsreels, authenticity is the highest political and ideological quality. What could be more eloquently convincing than the countless vivid facts in real life recorded by a talented and thoughtful news filmmaker?
    Science education films are the youngest art among our various genres. The science education film studio, which was established in 1953, has also made great progress. It plays a very important role and has great power in popularizing and promoting scientific knowledge to the broad masses, promoting various production technologies, technological reforms, and inventions, explaining and interpreting natural and social phenomena with a materialistic worldview, and publicizing the great achievements of our country's scientific, cultural construction, and technological creation in many aspects. Over the past ten years, many excellent films have also been produced, such as "Soil and Water Conservation," "Freshwater Fish Farming," "Cultivating Strong Seedlings," "Guilin Landscape," "Yangtze River Bridge," "Flying All Over the Sky," "Chinese Ape-Man," "Almaty-Lanzhou," and "In the Dense Forest of Xishuangbanna."
    The purpose of science education films is to reveal the secrets of the universe, record the exploration, conquest, and transformation of nature. If it is the most vivid and image-based science, then animation is the vast world where our film artists can best unfold their imagination and fantasy wings. This is the art most loved by children in New China. Over the past ten years, from a small group trying to produce black and white animation films to today, it has become an independent animation studio with a certain scale, capable of producing colored animation, puppet, and paper-cut films, and creating many vivid, novel, and interesting films. Now, our country's animation films have gradually developed a distinct national style. The folk legends, fables, myths, stories of various ethnic groups in China, as well as the characters in the classical novel Journey to the West: Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie, can all be vividly and richly expressed in animation films, and are also full of national characteristics; such as "Magic Brush," "The Proud General," "Flame Mountain," "Wooden Girl," "Mr. Dong Guo," "Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate," "Sculpting the Dragon," and "Fisher Boy"... Whether in content, form, or technology (photography, puppet operation, color application, image design), all aspects have made very significant progress and reached a very high level.
    A simple review of the achievements of various genres of film art can make one feel how broad and correct the path film art is taking. Naturally, the road is also tortuous: from the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" to the rectification and anti-rightist campaign, we have resolutely and repeatedly carried out the struggle between the two roads against bourgeois ideology and revisionist ideology. All kinds of revisionists and rightists always try to reduce the political role of our films, deny that the masses welcome the image of new heroes who reflect the struggles and construction of the working people, slander the masses, saying that the masses are simply unwilling to watch films with worker-peasant-soldier themes, and attempt to fundamentally deny the Party's direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and oppose the Party's leadership over the film industry. Facts have proved that without the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, there would have been no great leap forward in creative thinking and film production in 1958 and this year. Without these ideological struggles, it would not be possible to constantly urge filmmakers to combine with the masses and with practical struggles, to encourage their political enthusiasm, and to more firmly determine the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers!
     III
    At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, while taking over, rectifying, and actively preparing for production, the film industry first faced the difficulty of how to carry out a complex struggle for ideological positions in a situation where our film output was very small and the feudal and pornographic films left over from the American and British imperialists and the old society still occupied the entire market.
    We first established a unified and leading distribution agency nationwide, uniformly arranged film screenings in the state-owned screening system, vigorously promoted Soviet films and some progressive and harmless domestic films, strictly reviewed some harmful domestic films, and conducted social public opinion criticism at the same time.
    In order to enable our audiences to better accept and understand Soviet films, we began the first dubbing work in the history of Chinese film, and since then, we have always insisted on this work with great effort. This has made Soviet and other socialist countries' film art an indispensable part of the cultural life of the Chinese people.
    As our film output continued to grow and the awareness of the broad masses continued to improve, especially after the movement to resist America and aid Korea, the broad masses completely abandoned American reactionary films. Since then, those American films, most of which promoted imperialist aggression, racial oppression and discrimination, praised bourgeois moral concepts and pornography, ended their decades of dominance over the Chinese film market and were driven out of the Chinese film market.
    Over the past ten years, in order to strengthen the education of film for the working people, we have developed the film screening industry, mainly by first developing film screening teams in factories, mines, and rural areas, and appropriately developing urban cinemas. In particular, we must take special care of economically backward areas and minority ethnic areas. Tens of thousands of projectionists have overcome various difficulties, often climbing mountains and wading through rivers, braving the heat, wind, and rain, traveling to remote villages and border areas of the motherland, and enthusiastically delivering films to the broad masses.
    Over the past ten years, the number of film screening units nationwide has increased from more than 600 in 1949 to 15,000 by the end of this year, an increase of 23 times. This has completely changed the past situation where film units were densely populated in cities along the rivers and coasts, with an imbalanced distribution and an imbalance between urban and rural areas. Film screening units owned by factories, mines, rural areas, and troops account for more than three-quarters of all film screening units, which proves that the development of our film network has also implemented the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Over the past ten years, China's film studios have also developed at an astonishing speed. In 1949, we only had three film studios in Beijing, Shanghai, and Changchun. In 1952, the August 1st Film Studio was established. In 1953, the Central Newsreel Film Studio and the Science Education Film Studio were established. In 1957, the Shanghai Film Studio was expanded into three studios: Haiyan, Tianma, and Jiangnan. At the same time, the Animation Film Studio and the Translation Film Studio were established. In addition, new film studios were started in Beijing, Xi'an, and Guangzhou. During the great leap forward in 1958, all provinces and autonomous regions (except Tibet) established their own newsreel film studios. China has a vast territory and a large population, and the economic development of various regions is uneven, and the customs and habits of various regions are also different. Our country is also a multi-ethnic country. Therefore, the film production base should not be concentrated in a few large cities. Establishing comprehensive film studios in the cooperation zones of North China, East China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and Southwest China to produce feature films, and having each province produce newsreels, can better reflect the struggles and lives of the people in various regions and more timely reflect the situation of socialist revolution and socialist construction in various regions. At the same time, establishing film studios in various regions can absorb local literary and art workers to participate in film work. Because they are more familiar with the struggles and lives of the local people, they can better promote the blooming of a hundred flowers in film art. Developing production on a nationwide scale will surely bring a bright and colorful vision of prosperity to our booming film industry.
    For example, our feature film output was only six in 1949, and by 1957, when the first five-year plan was completed, it reached an annual output of 40. In 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, our feature film output jumped to 103 (including 49 documentary feature films). This year, we are continuing to leap forward, improve quality, and dedicate ourselves to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and have already produced and will produce more than 70 large-scale feature films, including more than 30 color films (including widescreen films). From 1949 to 1957, we produced a total of 171 feature films, while in the two years of the great leap forward, we will produce more than 170, which is equal to the total production in the past eight years. The number of color feature films produced in these two years is also equal to twice the number of color films produced in the past eight years. The output of other genres has also increased greatly. For example, newsreels produced only more than 1,000 reels in the past eight years, but 800 reels were produced in 1958 alone. Moreover, nearly half of them were produced by newly built film studios in various regions.
    Due to the development of the film screening network, the increase in film output, the number of film viewers is also growing rapidly. From more than 47 million in 1949 to more than 2.8 billion by the end of 1958, an increase of nearly 60 times compared to 1949.
    Due to the rapid development of film studios and screening networks, and also due to the continuous development of film technology and science internationally, great progress has been made in our film machinery production and new film science and technology research in the past ten years. In addition to the larger machinery factories in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Harbin, we have established film machinery repair factories in various provinces, some of which have also begun to manufacture film projectors during the great leap forward. At present, we can meet the needs of the development of the screening network in terms of projector equipment, and there is a small amount of exports, which has been well received abroad. We have also begun to manufacture various equipment for film production, and have trial-produced small cameras, large cameras, developing machines, recording machines, etc. The various equipment needed for our film production will soon be completely self-sufficient. Our major film studios quickly changed the backward manual developing to machine developing shortly after liberation, and have established a large fully mechanized developing factory. A larger film stock factory will also begin trial production this year. Progress in film technology is also rapid. We have relatively proficiently mastered the photography and developing of color films. In the two years of the great leap forward, we produced color widescreen films, and stereoscopic films and panoramic films have also been successfully trial-produced. With the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, we have also taken resolute steps in film technology and film industry, bravely and actively striding towards the advanced level of world film technology.
    The rapid development of the film industry requires the corresponding training of a large number of professionally proficient cadres. We have established the Beijing Film Academy and the Shanghai Film School, and established film actor training classes at the Changchun Film Studio. Several old film studios constantly transfer production technicians to new factories and train new cadres by way of apprenticeship. In addition, we also send students and graduate students to study in the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.
    Because film art requires a wide range of subject matter, and film itself is a comprehensive art, the creation and production of film art must achieve close cooperation and collaboration with various business departments and various art departments, which is the issue of firmly following the mass line in developing the film industry. In recent years, our film creation has received the cooperation of various business departments such as industry, agriculture, commerce, education, military, culture, education, science and technology, health, and sports, and has also received the assistance of various art units such as literature, music, drama, and fine arts. Taking the films dedicated to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China as an example, not only did various fraternal art groups provide many excellent scripts and support the production of these films with their most excellent playwrights, actors, directors, composers, and artists, but also a group of new film script writers and actors emerged from the masses.
    In order to encourage creation, summarize experience, and strengthen theoretical research, the Film Archive and the China Film Publishing House were established successively. A large number of various films and related materials from China and other countries around the world were collected and preserved, and nearly 300 kinds of books on film theory, film scripts, and film technology were published. A large number of film comic books, picture pages, and songs were also published. In addition, some film magazines such as Popular Film, Shanghai Film Pictorial, and Changchun Film Pictorial sell 700,000 to 800,000 copies every month; the two journals that specialize in publishing film scripts also sell about 1 million copies every year. Some film scripts sell tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of copies, and film literature scripts have begun to become an independent literary form. The development of film publications has also greatly promoted the development of film art creation and theory under the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.
    Overall, the achievements in the development of the film industry over the past ten years have been tremendous. In the 50 years of film history, ten years is only one-fifth of the journey, but it has completely changed the backward situation of the past 40 years and developed into a nationwide, comprehensive film industry under the leadership of the Party. Film has become an indispensable part of the cultural life of our people and a powerful weapon on the Party's ideological front that is most closely connected with the masses. At the same time, Chinese films have appeared in the international film community with a brand-new look and have been warmly welcomed by people all over the world who love peace and are concerned about New China. Over the past ten years, our country has exported more than 500 films to foreign countries, and more than 60 countries have screened our films in different ways. Our films have won more than 40 awards at international film festivals held in socialist and capitalist countries, and Chinese films have also gained a wide audience abroad. Chinese film has become a powerful weapon in the world peace movement.
    The great achievements made by Chinese film in the past ten years are mainly due to the Party and government's continuous and kind concern and correct leadership, and also a great victory for Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought!
                      IV
    The achievements of the past ten years have proved that film art has a broad mass base (according to recent statistics, the average number of film viewers is more than 300 million per month), and it should and must become an important propaganda weapon of the Party. Under the call of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, how can the film industry better publicize the Party's general line and serve the general line is the most fundamental task in future work!
    "Recalling the history of the revolution and praising the great leap forward" is a requirement from the masses' great leap forward. But it also includes two inseparable aspects of our film art creation. The broad masses not only love the heroic figures in various revolutionary periods, but also long to see the heroic figures of the liberated people who have mastered their own destiny and are building New China with soaring enthusiasm! The primary task of film serving the general line is to actively strive to reflect the heroic spirit of the broad masses under the glorious illumination of the general line, that is, the spirit of overwhelming mountains and overturning seas, and leaping forward. Are not the heroic deeds of the great leap forward of hundreds of millions of people an inexhaustible source of creation for us? If, in the infinitely broad garden of "recalling the history of the revolution and praising the great leap forward," one still feels that the subject matter is narrow and the forms and styles cannot be diversified, I am afraid it can only show the poverty of the creator's thinking, emotion, and even artistic ability.
    Therefore, to require film art to better implement the general line and serve socialist construction requires film creators to continue to transform their thinking, study Marxism-Leninism, go deeper into life, connect with the masses, and strive to improve their ideological level. They must have the same spirit of going all out and aiming high as the broad masses; at the same time, they must also actively improve their skills and fully master the characteristics of film in order to better summarize reality with greater ease. Only in this way can we create films with higher ideological and artistic qualities.
    The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend has proven to be the fundamental policy for developing and prospering film art creation. The diversification of subject matter, form, and style in the two years of the great leap forward, the free competition of different forms and styles; and the adoption of the method of free debate in the "watering flowers" and "weeding" work of theory and film criticism, on the one hand, adhering to the proletarian aesthetic view, and on the other hand, continuing to clear away various bourgeois literary and artistic ideas, has brought a new atmosphere of active creation and theory. This is an important driving force for promoting the great leap forward in creative thinking.
    For the film industry to better serve the construction of socialism, it is also necessary to actively rely on the leadership of local Party committees, mobilize the masses, adhere to the spirit of running factories diligently and thriftily, running the industry diligently and thriftily, strengthen enterprise management, strive to increase production and save costs, fully master various production technical capabilities, and improve the ideological and artistic quality of films in order to prepare for greater development in the future and popularize film better and more widely to the people. The film enterprise is a complex, multi-production enterprise. With the increasing development of modern science, the means of artistic expression in film are still advancing and becoming more perfect. Therefore, technical innovation must be constantly carried out in production technology, and the technical level of film production and machinery production must be continuously improved in order to adapt to the needs of the development of the industry.
    With the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, the improvement of the political and appreciation level of the broad masses, and the improvement of the country's political status, the Party and the country, and the people are eagerly expecting us to climb the peak of film art - this requires reaching the world's most advanced level faster in terms of ideology, art, and technology. We have full confidence and great ambition because experience - especially the experience of the great leap forward in the past two years - has proved that as long as we put politics in command, adhere to the mass line, and correctly implement the Party's literary and artistic policy: serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, letting a hundred flowers bloom, and letting a hundred schools of thought contend; humbly learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries, and constantly improving our ideological, artistic, and technical levels, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming<ctrl100> high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, adhering to putting politics in command, adhering to the mass line, the film industry can achieve faster and greater development, and can create better and more films to meet the needs of the people. Let us strive to climb the peak of film art and let a hundred flowers bloom in our socialist cultural garden. Let us hold high the glorious banner of the general line and continue the great leap forward, the film industry can develop and prosper even more, and it will definitely be able to better serve the general line and socialist construction.

    新中国电影事业的迅速发展
    荒煤
    一
    电影在中国是一门年青的艺术，只有五十多年的历史。这五十多年是一条非常曲折复杂的道路，但随着中国革命历史的进展，它也终于走上了一条宽广的光明大道。
    电影从1896年在上海第一次放映开始，就成为帝国主义、官僚、买办资产阶级追逐利润的手段。但是，在五四运动之后，中国无产阶级所领导的新的文化生力军举起了反帝反封建的大旗，电影也投入了这个规模宏大的激烈战斗，成为左翼文化运动中一个重要的组成部分；在党的领导和影响下曾经拍摄了“渔光曲”、“桃李劫”、“马路天使”、“十字街头”、“八百壮士”、“保卫我们土地”、“塞上风云”、“一江春水向东流”、“八千里路云和月”、“万家灯火”、“松花江上”、“希望在人间”等一批优秀影片。这些影片都是在十分艰苦的环境下，突破了国民党反动派种种迫害而摄制的。这些影片充满热情地揭露了帝国主义和国民党统治下的罪恶，反映了人民群众要求民主、自由和解放的愿望，因而获得了广大群众的欢迎和热爱。同时，在抗日战争和解放战争时期，在解放区，在极端困难的条件下，也都开展过电影工作。所以中国电影是有着长期的革命传统的。
    可是，在帝国主义的侵略与国民党反动统治下，电影作为一个现代复杂的企业来讲，从生产到发行、放映、技术方面都具有浓厚的半殖民地企业的性质，十分落后。旧中国的电影市场一直是为美英等帝国主义的影片所垄断，好莱坞的八大公司在中国各大城市中都有它的代理人，他们统治着全国大多数城市中绝大部分的放映系统，每年在中国放映的美国、英国影片达二、三百部以上。到1949年全国解放时，在中国这样一个大国家里，仅有五百九十六座电影院。而且影院绝大部分都集中在一些沿江沿海的大城市。从电影制片的胶片到摄影、洗印、放映等一切器材，都完全需要仰仗国外的进口。至于电影制片厂也都是破旧不堪，各种技术设备陈旧而又残缺不全。因此，在建国开始，电影事业完全是在一个一穷二白的情况下开始建设的。
    二
    影片生产——电影艺术创作，是整个电影事业的灵魂。影片是以社会主义、共产主义思想教育人民的一种最有群众性的艺术。电影艺术的各个片种——艺术片、新闻纪录片、科学教育片、美术片——它们都有各自不同的形式和特点，从多方面来影响广大的群众。因此，电影艺术创作的发展和繁荣，永远是电影事业中最根本、最中心的问题。
    在解放战争期间，许多电影工作者克服了种种困难，派遣了自己的狙击兵到解放战争的前线去拍摄新闻纪录片，有的同志甚至牺牲了自己的生命。在1949年拍摄了第一部故事片“桥”。这是中国工人阶级第一次不再以被压迫、被剥削、被同情的形象，而是以解放了的主人公姿态出现在银幕上！这部影片受到广大群众的欢迎。
    这是一个很好的开端，揭开了新中国电影的有历史意义的崭新的一页！而1950年生产的“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、“中华女儿”、“赵一曼”、“翠岗红旗”等艺术片，以及“百万雄师下江南”、“红旗漫卷西风”等新闻纪录片，就为电影艺术为工农兵服务的方向奠定了不可动摇的基础。“白毛女”、“中华女儿”这些电影片中所创造的在帝国主义、封建反动统治下坚强不屈的战斗着的人物的鲜明形象，以及各种斗争中新英雄人物的光辉，照耀着我们电影艺术创作的道路！毛泽东同志的文艺方针的正确性，又一次为电影艺术的成就所证实了。
    但是，在当时，也还有一部分电影工作者却并没有真正树立为工农兵服务的思想。在解放之后，他们对于电影去描写工农兵的斗争和生活，还有许多忧虑和怀疑，也还不能意识到思想改造的重要性。党及时地给我们敲了一下警钟。“武训传”的批判和文艺整风，提出了要以工人阶级思想教育人民的任务，和资产阶级反动思想展开了坚决的斗争。经过这场斗争，电影界才更明确了为工农兵服务的方向。
    事实也证明，解放之后，中国的广大人民渴望了解过去几十年革命斗争的丰富历史，了解新中国如何在艰巨的斗争中光荣诞生的历史。十年来所摄制的一些反映中国武装革命斗争、地下斗争的影片，如“中华女儿”、“钢铁战士”、“赵一曼”、“翠岗红旗”、“南征北战”、“渡江侦察记”、“鸡毛信”、“平原游击队”、“董存瑞”、“母亲”、“上甘岭”、“五更寒”、“党的女儿”、“红孩子”、“永不消逝的电波”、“铁窗烈火”、“海魂”等等，都受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。许多影片中生动鲜明的革命英雄的形象往往成为鼓舞人民、尤其是青年一代从事社会主义革命和社会主义建设的力量和他们仿效的榜样。
    根据党的百花齐放的方针，我们的电影创作力求题材、形式、风格的多样化，也制作了像“梁山伯与祝英台”、“天仙配”、“秦香莲”、“哈森与加米拉”、“祖国的花朵”、“宋景诗”、“为了和平”、“寂静的山林”、“边寨烽火”、“女篮五号”、“祝福”等许多优秀的影片。1958年还生产了像“水库上的歌声”、“黄宝妹”、“三八河边”这样一些优秀的纪录性艺术片。这是一种新的样式，是电影艺术片中的报告文学，是电影创作大跃进的产物。这将使艺术片的创作更加有可能来迅速地反映大跃进，产生更多更有现实意义的作品。1959年建国十周年的新片展览，就像一幅近百年史的生动的画卷，展示了多么丰富复杂的生活斗争和人物性格。从“林则徐”、“风暴”、“万水千山”、“青春之歌”、“音乐家聂耳”、“林家铺子”、“海鹰”、“冰上姊妹”到“风从东方来”，题材是如此广阔，而形式和风格又如此丰富多采。而且，“老兵新传”、“钢铁世家”、“春满人间”、“绿州凯歌”等影片，在创造建设中的新英雄人物形象方面，有了可喜的成就！
    新中国十年建设的伟大胜利，通过新闻纪录片在银幕上也得到了充分的表现，如果说中国革命胜利又一次揭示了历史上震撼世界的新的一页，那么，新闻纪录片就是这个历史最有力的见证。
    勇敢勤劳的中国人民在伟大人民领袖毛主席和中国共产党领导下，以飞跃的速度来建设新中国的真实情况——我们伟大祖国每一个前进的步伐，都在新闻纪录电影中留下鲜明、真实、动人的脚迹！
    十年来，新闻纪录电影创造了许多优秀的影片：如长纪录片“百万雄师下江南”、与苏联合拍的“解放了的中国”、“中国人民的胜利”、“抗美援朝”、“一定要把淮河修好”、“移山填海”、“在总路线光辉的照耀下”、“平息西藏叛乱”、“百万农奴站起来”、“第十个春天”、“英雄战胜北大荒”，短纪录片“交换病伤战俘”、“永恒的友谊”、“英雄抢修黄河铁桥”、“齐白石”、“泥人张”等等。
    新闻纪录电影十年来已经建立了它的优良传统：它是我们艺术中永远走在时代最前列的狙击兵，是探索祖国前进脉搏跳动的最敏锐的触觉。它把亲眼所见的新人新事，真实而又生动地纪录下来，向全世界人民揭示祖国伟大的前进的历史的真实。真实性对于新闻纪录片来讲，就是最高的政治性和思想性，还有什么能比一个有才能的有思想的新闻电影工作者所纪录的无数真实生活中生动的事实更能雄辩地说服人们呢？
    科学教育影片则是我们各个片种中最年青的艺术，从1953年才开始建立的科教片厂到现在也获得很大进步。它对广大群众普及、推广科学知识，推广各种生产技术、技术改革、创造发明，以唯物主义世界观来阐明、解释自然现象与社会现象，宣传我国科学、文化建设、技术创造的伟大成就的许多方面，都有非常重要的作用和力量。十年来也产生许多优秀的影片，如“水土保持”、“淡水养鱼”、“培育壮秧”、“桂林山水”、“长江大桥”、“满天飞”、“中国猿人”、“阿拉木图——兰州”、“在西双版纳的密林中”等。
    科教片目的是在揭露宇宙秘密，记录探索、征服自然和改造自然的一切。如果说它是最生动的形象的科学，那么，美术片就是我们电影艺术家最能展开想像、幻想翅膀的广阔天地了。这是新中国儿童最喜欢的一种艺术。十年来，从一个试制黑白动画片的小组发展到今天，已经成为独立的有一定规模的美术片厂，能够摄制彩色的动画、木偶和剪纸片，创造了许多生动、新颖、有趣的影片。现在，我国的美术片，已经逐渐有了鲜明的民族风格。中国各民族的民间传说、寓言、神话、故事以及古典小说西游记中的人物：孙悟空、猪八戒，在美术片中都能够得到非常生动而丰富的表现，也富有民族特色；像“神笔”、“骄傲的将军”、“火焰山”、“木头姑娘”、“东郭先生”、“小鲤鱼跳龙门”、“雕龙记”、“渔童”……无论是在内容和形式上以及技术上（摄影、木偶操作、色彩运用、形象设计）各个方面，都有非常显著的进步，达到了很高的水平。
    简单地回顾一下电影艺术各个片种的成就，就可以感觉到，电影艺术是走向一条多么宽广而正确的道路。自然，道路也是曲折的：从“武训传”批判到整风反右，我们坚决和资产阶级思想、修正主义思想反复地进行过两条道路的斗争。形形色色的修正主义者与右派分子总是力图降低我们影片的政治作用，否认群众欢迎反映劳动人民的斗争和建设的新英雄人物的形象，诬蔑群众，说群众根本不愿意看工农兵题材的影片，企图根本否定党的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，反对党对电影事业的领导。事实已证明，没有1957年的反右派斗争，就不可能有1958年和今年的创作思想、影片生产的大跃进。没有这种种思想斗争，就不可能经常督促电影工作者与群众、与实际斗争的结合，鼓舞他们的政治热情，更加坚定为工农兵服务的方向！
     三
    建国之初，电影事业在接管、整顿、积极准备生产的同时，首先面临的困难，是在我们影片产量很少、美英帝国主义以及旧社会遗留下来的封建、黄色的影片还占据整个市场的情况下，如何来进行一场复杂的思想阵地的争夺战。
    我们首先建立了全国范围的统一领导的发行机构，在国营放映系统统一排片，大力推广苏联的电影和一些进步的、无害的国产影片，对一些有害的国产影片进行严格的审查，同时进行社会舆论的批评。
    为了使我国观众更好地接受和理解苏联的影片，我们开始了中国电影历史上的第一次配音工作，而且自此以后，我们一直用很大的力量坚持这个工作。这样就使得苏联和其他兄弟国家社会主义的电影艺术，成为中国人民文化生活中一个不可缺少的部分。
    随着我国影片产量不断增长，随着广大人民觉悟不断提高，特别是到抗美援朝运动之后，广大群众就完全抛弃了美国的反动影片。从此以后，那些绝大部分以宣扬帝国主义侵略、种族压迫和歧视、歌颂资产阶级道德观念和色情的美国影片，终止了几十年来对中国电影市场的统治，被撵出了中国电影市场。
    十年来，为了加强电影对劳动人民的教育，我们发展电影放映事业，主要是采取首先发展工矿、农村放映队，适当地发展城市影院的方针。并且，要特别照顾经济落后的地区和少数民族地区。几万放映队员们，他们克服种种困难，往往登山涉水，冒着炎热、风雨，走遍穷乡僻壤、祖国边疆，满腔热情地把电影输送到广大群众中去。
    十年来全国放映单位从1949年的六百多个发展到今年年底将达到一万五千个，增长了二十三倍。这就完全改变了过去电影单位密集沿江沿海城市，分布不平衡，城乡之间不平衡的情况。工矿、农村、部队所拥有的放映单位占全部放映单位四分之三以上，这就证明了我们电影网的发展也贯彻了为工农兵服务的方针。
    十年来我国电影制片厂也以惊人的速度发展着。1949年我们只有北京、上海、长春三个制片厂，到1952年建立了八一电影制片厂，1953年成立中央新闻纪录电影片厂，科学教育片厂，1957年把上海电影制片厂扩大为海燕、天马、江南三个厂，同时建立了美术片厂、翻译片厂。此外又在北京、西安、广州开始建立新的制片厂。1958年大跃进期间，全国各省和自治区（除西藏外）都建立了自己的新闻纪录片厂。中国地广人多，各地区的经济发展不平衡，各个地区风俗人情也不一样，我国又是一个多民族的国家，因此电影生产基地不宜于集中在少数几个大城市。以华北、华东、西北、东北、西南各省协作区为中心建立综合性的制片厂拍摄艺术片，各省拍摄新闻纪录片，就能够更好地来反映各个地区人民斗争和生活，更加及时地反映各地区社会主义革命和社会主义建设的情况。同时，在各地区建立电影制片厂，可以吸收当地文艺工作者参加电影工作，由于他们比较熟悉当地人民斗争和生活，就可以更好地促进电影艺术的百花齐放。这样在全国范围全国规模地发展制片生产，一定会为我们蓬勃发展的电影事业带来美好的万紫千红的繁荣的远景。
    例如，我们的艺术片产量1949年只有六部，到1957年第一个五年计划完成时期，达到年产四十部。1958年，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我们的艺术片一跃而为一百零三部（其中包括纪录性艺术片四十九部）。今年继续跃进，提高质量，向建国十周年献礼，已经和将要生产大型艺术片七十余部，仅彩色影片（包括宽银幕在内）就有三十余部。从1949年到1957年我们总共生产艺术片一百七十一部，而在两年的大跃进中就将生产一百七十余部，等于过去八年生产的总和。这两年生产的彩色艺术片也等于过去八年生产彩色片的两倍。其他各片种的产量也大大地增加了，如新闻纪录片，过去八年只生产了一千多本，但是1958年就生产了八百余本。而且近一半是各地新建制片厂的出品。
    由于电影放映网的发展，影片产量增长，电影观众人数也在飞跃增长。从1949年的四千七百多万人次，到1958年底增长到二十八亿多人次，比1949年增长近六十倍。
    由于制片厂和放映网的迅速发展，也由于国际上电影技术科学不断发展，十年中我们电影机械生产和新的电影科学技术研究工作都有了很大进展。我们除了规模较大的南京、上海、哈尔滨机械厂外，在各省都建立了电影机械修配厂，其中有一些修配厂在大跃进中也开始制造电影放映机。目前我们在放映机设备方面可以满足放映网发展的需要，并有少量的出口，已在国外得到好评。我们也开始制作电影生产的各种设备，已试制成小型摄影机、大型摄影机、洗印机、录音机等。我国在制片设备方面所需要的各种器材，不久就完全可以自给了。我国几个大制片厂在解放后不久，很快地将落后的手工洗印改为机器洗印，并已建立一座全部机械化的大洗印厂。一座规模较大的胶片厂今年也将开始试生产了。在电影技术方面的进展也是迅速的，我们已经比较熟练地掌握了彩色片的摄影和洗印；在大跃进的两年内，我们制作了彩色宽银幕电影，立体电影和全景电影也已经试制成功了。在苏联和兄弟国家帮助下，我们电影技术和电影工业方面，也采取了坚决的步骤，勇敢地积极地向世界电影技术先进水平大步迈进。
    电影事业的迅速发展，要求相应地培养大批的精通业务的干部。我们已经建立了北京电影学院、上海电影学校，在长春电影制片厂建立了电影演员训练班。几个老制片厂不断向新厂输送生产技术人员，并以带徒弟的方式培养新干部。此外，我们还派遣留学生、研究生到苏联和其他兄弟国家学习。
    由于电影艺术需要有广泛的题材，电影本身又是一种综合性的艺术，所以电影艺术的创作、生产，必须和各项业务部门及各种艺术部门取得密切的配合和协作，这也就是发展电影事业必须坚决地走群众路线的问题。几年以来，我们的电影创作得到了工、农、商、学、兵，文教、科技、卫生、体育……各个业务部门的协作，也得到了文学、音乐、戏剧、美术……各种艺术单位的协助。就以建国十周年献礼影片为例，不仅各兄弟艺术团体提供了许多优秀剧本，以他们最优秀的剧作家、演员、导演、作曲家、美术家来支援了这些影片的摄制，而且还从群众中涌现了一批新的电影剧本作家和演员。
    为了鼓励创作、总结经验、加强理论研究工作，相继成立电影资料馆和中国电影出版社。大量收集和保藏了中国与世界各国各种影片和有关的资料，并且出版了电影理论、电影剧本、电影技术等近三百种书籍。还出版了大量电影连环画册、画页、歌曲。此外，像大众电影、上影画报、长影画报一些电影画刊，每月销售七、八十万册；两个专门发表电影剧本的刊物，每年也销售约一百万册。有的电影剧本行销数万册乃至十数万册，电影文学剧本，已开始成为一种独立的文学形式。电影出版书刊的发展，在百花齐放、百家争鸣方针下，也大大促进了电影艺术创作和理论的发展。
    总的来看，电影事业十年来的发展成绩是巨大的。在五十多年的电影史中，十年，不过是其中五分之一的历程，但是，它已经完全改变了四十多年来落后的状况，在党的领导下发展为一个全国规模、全面发展的电影事业。电影已经成为我国人民文化生活中不可缺少的一部分，是党的思想战线上一个最密切联系群众的强有力的武器。同时，中国电影以崭新的面貌出现在国际电影界，也受到世界各国爱好和平、关心新中国的人民的热烈欢迎。十年来，我国向国外输出的影片已经有五百余部，有六十多个国家通过不同的方式上映了我国影片。在社会主义和资本主义国家所举办的国际电影节上曾经获奖四十多次，我国电影在国外也获得了广大的观众。中国电影已经成为世界和平运动中的一个有力的武器了。
    中国电影在十年内取得如此巨大的成就，主要是由于党和政府的不断的亲切的关怀和正确的领导，也是毛主席文艺思想的伟大胜利！
                      四
    十年来的成就已经证明：电影艺术具有广泛的群众性（据最近的统计，电影观众每月平均在三亿以上），它应该、也必须成为党的一个重要宣传武器。在党的八届八中全会决议的号召下，电影事业如何更好地来宣传党的总路线、为总路线服务，是今后工作中的最根本的任务！
    “回忆革命史，歌颂大跃进”，这是来自群众大跃进的要求。但是却也包括了我们电影艺术创作两个不可分割的方面。广大群众既热爱在各个革命时期的英雄人物，也渴望能看到解放了的、掌握了自己命运的人民，以冲天干劲来建设新中国的英雄人物！电影要为总路线服务，首要的任务，是要积极努力来反映在总路线光辉照耀下，广大群众那种排山倒海、大步跃进的英雄气概。难道几亿人民的大跃进的英雄行为，不正是我们取之不尽的创作的源泉么？如果说，在“回忆革命史、歌颂大跃进”这个无限广阔的园地里，还感到题材窄狭，形式风格不能多样化，恐怕只能说明是创作者思想上、情感上以至艺术能力的贫乏了。
    因此，要求电影艺术更好地贯彻总路线，为社会主义建设服务，就要求电影创作者继续改造思想、学习马列主义、更加深入生活，联系群众，努力提高自己的思想水平，要和广大群众一样有鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神；同时，还要积极提高技巧，充分掌握电影特性，才能得心应手地更高地来概括现实。只有这样，才能创造出有更高的思想性和艺术性的影片。
    百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，已经证明是发展、繁荣电影艺术创作的根本方针，大跃进的两年来，题材、形式、风格的多样化，不同形式、风格的自由竞赛；以及在理论和影评的“浇花”“锄草”的工作中，采取自由辩论的方式，一方面坚持无产阶级的美学观，一方面继续扫清种种资产阶级的文艺思想，已经带来了一种活跃创作和理论的新气象。这是促进创作思想大跃进的一个重要的动力。
    电影事业要更好地为建设社会主义服务，还需要积极依靠各地党委的领导，发动群众，坚持勤俭办厂、勤俭办事业的精神，加强企业管理，努力增产节约，降低成本，充分掌握各种生产的技术能力，提高影片的思想质量和艺术质量，以准备今后的更大发展，把电影更好地更加广泛地普及到人民群众中去。电影企业是一个复杂的、多种生产的企业，电影在现代科学日益发展的情况下，艺术表现手段还在继续前进、日趋完美，因而在生产技术上也必须不断革新，不断提高制片生产、机械生产的技术水平，才能适应事业发展的需要。
    随着国家工农业生产的大跃进，广大人民政治、欣赏水平的提高，国家政治地位的提高，党和国家、人民都在热烈期待我们攀登电影艺术的高峰——这要求在思想上、艺术上和技术上更快地达到世界最先进的水平。我们完全有这样的信心和大志，因为经验——尤其是这两年来大跃进的经验都证明了：只要政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，正确执行党的文艺方针：为工农兵服务、百花齐放，百家争鸣；虚心学习苏联及其他国家的先进经验，不断提高自己思想、艺术和技术水平，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，电影事业就能得到更快、更大的发展，就能创作出更好更多的影片来满足人民的需要。让我们努力攀登电影艺术的高峰，在我国社会主义文化园地里百花齐放吧。让我们高举总路线的光辉旗帜，继续大跃进，电影事业就能够更加发展、更加繁荣，就一定能够更好地为总路线、为社会主义建设服务。
