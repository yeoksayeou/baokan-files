Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th—According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency tonight: The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, when answering questions from a Vietnam News Agency reporter today on the situation in Laos, said that the recent situation in Laos remains serious. U.S. imperialism continues to transport more weapons into Laos; Pei Sananikone’s government and the heads of the so-called “Committee for the Defense of National Interests” continue to expand the civil war.

The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that in the past, U.S. imperialism and the Lao authorities exaggerated the war situation in Laos, slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos' internal affairs, and requested the United Nations to intervene. Now, they are also propagating that "the situation has been greatly eased since the United Nations Investigation Group Committee arrived in Laos." This is to deceive world public opinion and use it as an excuse to request the United Nations to establish a permanent agency in Laos to facilitate the United States' further intervention in Laos under the name of the United Nations.

The spokesman said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has stated that the United Nations Security Council's decision to establish the so-called "Laos Situation Investigation Group Committee" and send this group committee to Laos is illegal, violates the United Nations Charter, and violates the Geneva Agreement on Laos. The arrival of this group committee in Laos will not only fail to solve any problems, but will only further complicate the situation in Laos.

The spokesman then pointed out that during the period when this group committee was conducting activities in Laos, the Lao authorities tried every means to fabricate false evidence to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the embarrassing posture they showed when providing materials to the "Investigation Group Committee" and their self-contradictory statements on the situation in Laos—even Western newspapers have talked about these contradictions—completely exposed the fraudulent nature of their arguments and cannot but make people doubt the results of the investigation by this group committee.

The spokesman of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also talked about his views on the Kingdom of Laos government sending a delegation headed by Prime Minister Pei Sananikone to the United Nations. He said that after the Lao Minister of Foreign Affairs, Khamphan Panya, and Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Sisouk Na Champassak, were sent to the United Nations, the Kingdom of Laos government sent another delegation headed by Prime Minister Pei Sananikone, including personnel from the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," to the United Nations. This shows that the Lao authorities feel very embarrassed about the reaction of world public opinion to their deceptive rhetoric that slanders the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Based on the information known and the statements made by Prime Minister Pei Sananikone, everyone can clearly see that the purpose of the Lao authorities this time to the United Nations is to urge the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly to send observers to Laos, or to establish a permanent United Nations agency in Laos, and to use the name of the United Nations to tear up the Geneva Agreement, allowing the United States to further interfere in Laos under the banner of the United Nations.

The spokesman pointed out that Pei Sananikone also revealed that he would ask the U.S. State Department to increase military assistance to strengthen Laos' military power. It is obvious that the Kingdom of Laos government is trying its best to realize the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to further interfere in Laos under the banner of the United Nations, turn Laos into a U.S. military base, and threaten peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. In order to stop this conspiracy, the United Nations must refute the slanderous arguments of the Kingdom of Laos authorities and oppose their unreasonable demands.

The spokesman finally said that in the current international situation that is tending towards easing, the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and pro-American elements in Laos to undermine peace will definitely be exposed and will definitely suffer a disastrous defeat.

### 越南外交部指出老挝局势仍然严重  美国假借联合国名义扩大干涉老挝

    越南外交部指出老挝局势仍然严重
    美国假借联合国名义扩大干涉老挝
    新华社河内20日电　据越南通讯社今晚报道：越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人今天在就老挝局势答越南通讯社记者问时说，老挝最近的局势仍然严重，美帝国主义继续把更多的武器运进老挝；培·萨纳尼空政府和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们继续在扩大内战。
    外交部发言人说，过去，美帝国主义和老挝当局夸大老挝的战况，诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政，要求联合国出面干涉。现在，他们又宣传说“联合国调查小组委员会到老挝之后已经使局势大大地缓和了”。这是为了欺骗世界舆论，借故要求联合国在老挝设立常设机构，以便利于美国利用联合国的名义进一步干涉老挝。
    发言人说，越南民主共和国政府曾经声明，联合国安全理事会决定成立所谓“老挝局势调查小组委员会”和把这个小组委员会派到老挝是不合法的、是违反联合国宪章、违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议的。这个小组委员会到老挝不但不能解决任何问题，而且只能使老挝局势更加复杂化。
    发言人接着指出，在这个小组委员会在老挝进行活动的期间，老挝当局千方百计地捏造假证据来诬蔑越南民主共和国。但是，他们在向“调查小组委员会”提供材料时表现出来的狼狈姿态以及他们就老挝局势发表的自相矛盾的声明——连西方报纸也谈到了这些矛盾——完全揭露了自己的论调的欺诈性，不能不使人对这个小组委员会调查的结果发生怀疑。
    越南外交部发言人还谈到他对老挝王国政府向联合国派遣以培·萨纳尼空首相为首的代表团的看法。他说，在老挝外交大臣坎番·班雅和宣传副大臣西苏·纳占巴萨被派到联合国之后，老挝王国政府又向联合国派遣以培·萨纳尼空首相为首的、包括所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的人员的代表团，这说明了老挝当局对于世界舆论对他们诬蔑越南民主共和国欺骗论调的反应感到非常狼狈。根据所知道的消息和培·萨纳尼空首相发表的声明，大家很清楚地看到老挝当局这一次到联合国的目的是要促使安理会和联合国大会向老挝派遣观察员，或者成立联合国驻老挝的常设机构，利用联合国的名义来撕毁日内瓦协议，让美国打着联合国的旗帜进一步干涉老挝。
    发言人指出，培·萨纳尼空还透露他要向美国国务院要求增加军事援助以加强老挝的军事力量。很明显，老挝王国政府正在竭力实现美帝国主义打着联合国的旗帜进一步干涉老挝、把老挝变成美国的军事基地、威胁印度支那和东南亚和平的阴谋。为了制止这种阴谋，联合国必须驳斥老挝王国当局的诬蔑论调和反对他们的无理要求。
    发言人最后说，在趋于缓和的当前国际形势下，美帝国主义和老挝的亲美分子破坏和平的阴谋一定要被揭穿，一定要遭到惨重的失败。
