Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots Pay Tribute to Party and State Leaders in Celebration of the Great Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation

(Reported by our newspaper) On October 1, people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a celebration rally to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and wrote a letter to the Party and state leaders to pay their respects. The full text is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou:

Today, compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with the warmest feelings. On behalf of the compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, we would like to pay our most sincere and highest respects to you. We feel infinite joy at the great victories that the motherland has achieved in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and express our warm congratulations!

In the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, the great Chinese people have gone through the three-year period of economic recovery and the successful completion of the first five-year plan, which has enabled the motherland to achieve tremendous achievements in politics, economy, diplomacy, and culture, education, science, and technology. Especially in 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, after Chairman Mao put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," a great upsurge in production and construction was set off on all fronts, and an unprecedented great leap forward and the people's commune movement emerged. This has not only enabled the motherland to rapidly take a big step forward in the course of building socialism, but also made the motherland create a glorious example in the history of the world.

We are delighted to see that the people of the motherland are confidently striving to complete the main production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year, and are fighting with high spirits and enthusiasm to change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland more quickly. We, the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, feel that it is really something to be proud of as a Chinese!

All these great and unprecedented achievements of the motherland fully prove that your leadership is completely correct, the general line will continue to be victorious, and the people's commune has a bright future; at the same time, it also proves that only the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can truly make the motherland prosperous and strong, and can bring happiness to the people!

Today, the compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon solemnly assure the motherland: We will unite more closely, love the motherland more, and unite more firmly around you, support the general line, support the Great Leap Forward, and support the people's commune. We once again cheer for the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction and pay tribute to the heroic people of the motherland who are dedicated to the cause of socialist construction!

In the past ten years, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the people of the motherland have achieved brilliant achievements in politics, economy, culture, and education with the heroic spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas. Although this year has suffered from natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect pests, the harvest has not only not decreased but has increased compared with last year. The iron facts fully prove the correctness of the general line, show the superiority of the people's commune, the international prestige of the motherland is increasing day by day, the international status has been unprecedentedly improved, and the peaceful diplomatic policy has achieved great victories, and our friends are all over the world. Great achievements and feats, unprecedented in history, are radiant and admired by the world. All Macao compatriots feel infinitely honored and proud of the glorious achievements of the motherland in the past ten years. Macao compatriots have been deeply cared for and cared for by the motherland over the years, and feel incomparably warm. In the future, we will definitely adhere to the spirit of "patriotism as one family," make persistent efforts, further strengthen the unity of compatriots, and actively run welfare undertakings. We must hold the banner of patriotism even higher and love our great motherland a hundredfold. On the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, we look up to Beijing and extend our highest respect to you, and wish you good health and lead the people of the whole country to achieve new and greater victories.

    祖国这一切伟大的、史无前例的成就，充分证明了你们的领导是完全正确的，总路线是会不断胜利的，人民公社是有光明前途的；同时，也证明了只有中国共产党的领导，才能真正使祖国臻于富强，才能给人民带来幸福！
    今天港九各界同胞，庄严地向祖国保证：我们将更加团结一致，更加热爱祖国，并且更加牢固地团结在你们的周围，拥护总路线，拥护大跃进，拥护人民公社。我们再一次为祖国的社会主义建设的伟大成就欢呼，并向全体献身于社会主义建设事业的英雄的祖国人民致敬！
