Xinhua News Agency report: Shanxi Province, whether mountainous or plains, has universally entered the busy season of autumn harvest, with frequent good news of large-scale, high-yield crops of grain, cotton, oil, and other crops coming from all directions.

In the Taihang Mountains, over 35,000 mu of corn in eleven people's communes in Licheng County averaged over 500 jin per mu; over 20,000 mu of millet averaged over 400 jin per mu. Thirty management areas have increased the yield of autumn crops this year by 10% to 30% compared to last year, breaking through the 500 jin per mu mark, crossing the "Yellow River"; five management areas increased production by 30% to 50% compared to last year, with an average yield exceeding 800 jin per mu, crossing the "Yangtze River."

In the Lüliang Mountains, Wuzhai County's one million mu of harvested autumn crops have an average yield increase of 17% compared to last year; large-scale high-yield fields generally increased production by more than 20% compared to last year.

In Yicheng County, Jinan Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area, initial picking indicates that 150,000 mu of cotton can average 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, a 25% increase compared to the bumper harvest of 1958. The Xiliang Management Area of Chengguan Commune, led by the nationally renowned cotton-growing model Wu Chun'an, has 1,149 mu of cotton averaging over 170 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

In Xinding County, Shanxi Province, which is rich in oil crops, over 100,000 mu of oil crops this year can universally exceed 100 jin per mu, with a total output increase of more than 20% compared to last year.

Shanxi Province's large-scale high-yield fields this year have a large area and wide range, from plains to mountains, from irrigated land to dry land, from food crops to cash crops, everywhere and in every category. Because the large-scale high-yield competition movement has been interlinked from sowing to autumn harvest, this year's food crops have tall stalks, large ears, and full grains. After inspection and experimentation by cadres and commune members of Chengguan Commune in Yicheng County, this year's cotton bolls are more numerous than in any previous year: in the past, 75 to 80 bolls weighed one jin, but this year it takes less than 70 bolls to weigh one jin. Last year, 2.7 jin of seed cotton were processed into one jin of ginned cotton, but this year, 2.5 jin can be processed into one jin of ginned cotton.

This year, Shanxi's rural areas continued to carry out the Great Leap Forward movement, and the people's communes have demonstrated great superiority in production. This has played a decisive role in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, resisting natural disasters, and ensuring a bumper harvest. Bacun People's Commune in Jincheng County, located in the loess hilly area of the Taihang Mountains, carried out unified planning this year, implemented "millet up the mountains, corn down to the plains, sorghum into the gullies" according to the adaptability of crops, achieved suiting measures to local conditions, and organized commune members to carry out large-scale tool reforms and create indigenous fertilizers, solving difficulties such as labor and fertilizer shortages. The entire production level has greatly improved compared to the past. In particular, there was no rain throughout the entire summer, suffering a severe drought unprecedented in sixteen years. The commune organized over 10,000 people to fight the drought, using all five sources of water from reservoirs, ponds, wells, springs, and rivers to irrigate over 30,000 mu of drought-stricken seedlings. This year, not only was there no reduction in production, but the average yield per mu increased by 15% compared to last year.

According to the Hebei Daily news: Hebei Province has generally reaped a bumper cotton harvest. According to preliminary statistics at the end of September, the province has already picked over 394 million jin of seed cotton. Based on actual picking and forecasts from various regions, cotton production this year is expected to increase by 10% to 30%.

This year, Hebei Province's over 14 million mu of cotton generally grew well, with few fallen bolls, many bolls, early boll opening, long fibers, and high quality. The high-yield demonstration plots, which account for a quarter of the total cotton area, grew even more excellently. Handan Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area, is expected to increase cotton production by about 30% this year. Shijiazhuang Prefecture also increased production by 16.6% compared to last year.

The reason for the bumper cotton harvest is primarily the result of the Party strengthening leadership, putting politics in command, and putting the General Line in command. The prefectural, county, and people's commune Party committees in all cotton-producing areas have a Party secretary specifically in charge of cotton production; some places have also established cotton offices, forming a strong front for managing cotton under the leadership of the Party committee. In vigorously promoting cotton production, Party committees at all levels have always adhered to the spirit of continuous revolution, criticized right-leaning conservative sentiments, and actively promoted various advanced experiences. Cixian County, famous throughout the province for cotton production, actively promoted high-ridge cultivation on 12,000 mu of cotton this year and early sowing after seedling raising on 12,000 mu. According to surveys, high-ridge cotton has an average of 2.55 more bolls per plant than flat-ridge cotton, and the shedding rate is reduced by 4.7%; cotton transplanted after raising seedlings in solar greenhouses has an average of 0.8 more bolls per plant than direct-seeded cotton; cotton transplanted after raising seedlings in greenhouses began to open bolls in early July, and by August 20, an average of 120 jin of new cotton had been picked per mu, creating a miracle of cotton maturing one and a half months earlier.

The people's communes have opened up a broad field for the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, ensuring increased cotton production. After communization, millions of commune members in Handan Prefecture dug wells, opened canals, and built pits, ponds, and reservoirs, increasing irrigated land from 2.6 million mu to 9.6 million mu. The land has undergone large-scale deep plowing. Due to the large scope of the communes, it is possible to plant according to local conditions, uniformly divide plots, and all achieve north-south ridges to achieve ventilation and light transmission. The province has established more than 10,000 high-yield cotton demonstration plots, with a total area of more than 3.7 million mu. In terms of planting, early sowing (advanced by five to ten days) and wide-narrow row planting methods have been widely promoted, which are both densely planted and can better ventilate and transmit light, promoting cotton yield and reducing boll shedding. At the same time, this year the province has basically popularized the Dai No. 15 improved cotton variety and has promptly controlled pests.

Encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the vast number of cotton farmers who have achieved a bumper harvest are full of energy and high morale, actively strengthening the late-stage management of cotton, and are determined to strive for more overproduction. More than 960,000 people in Handan Prefecture have invested in the late-stage management and harvesting of cotton. Cixian County cotton farmers launched a competition of "one upgrade" (comprehensively upgrading cotton quality), "two promotions" (promoting early maturity and early opening), "three increases" (increasing large bolls, increasing old bolls, and increasing white flowers), and "four no-drops" (no dropping eyelashes on the plant, no dropping fallen cotton in the field, no dropping at the edge of the field, no dropping on the road), determined to increase ginned cotton by another five jin per mu. Wuqiao County, which is expected to increase cotton production by more than one time this year, has seen more than 50,000 commune members set off a high tide of management, striving for one to two more bolls per plant.

　　处处报丰收　项项有高产
    山西粮棉油大面积高额丰产纪录不断出现
    河北一千四百多万亩棉花可增产一至三成
    据新华社讯　山西省不论山地或平川，秋收普遍进入大忙，粮、棉、油等作物大面积高额丰产的喜报不断从四面八方传来。
    太行山区黎城县十一个人民公社的三万五千多亩玉米，平均亩产五百斤以上；两万多亩谷子，平均亩产四百多斤。有三十个管理区今年秋作物的产量比去年增产一成到三成，突破了平均亩产五百斤的大关，跨过了“黄河”；有五个管理区比去年增产三成到五成，平均亩产突破了八百斤大关，越过了“长江”。
    吕梁山区五寨县已经收获的一百万亩秋作物，平均亩产比去年提高17％；大面积高额丰产田普遍比去年增产两成以上。
    主要产棉区晋南专区的翼城县，根据初摘情况，十五万亩棉花可以平均亩产皮棉八十斤，比大丰收的1958年提高25％。全国著名植棉模范吴春安领导的城关公社西梁管理区，一千一百四十九亩棉花，平均每亩可产皮棉一百七十多斤。
    山西省盛产油料的忻定县，今年十万多亩油料作物可以普遍超过亩产一百斤，总产量比去年提高两成多。
    山西省今年的大面积高额丰产田，面积大，范围广，从平川到山地，从水地到旱地，从粮食作物到经济作物，处处有，项项有。由于从播种到秋收，大面积高额丰产竞赛运动一环扣一环，使得今年粮食作物株高、穗大、籽粒满。翼城县城关公社干部和社员们经过检查试验，今年棉桃比以往任何一年都多：过去七十五个到八十个重一斤，今年一斤还不到七十个，去年二斤七两籽棉加工一斤皮棉，今年二斤五两即可加工一斤皮棉。
    今年山西农村继续开展大跃进运动，人民公社在生产中发挥出巨大优越性，这对贯彻农业“八字宪法”、抗拒自然灾害和保证大丰收起了决定性的作用。地处太行山黄土丘陵区的晋城县巴公人民公社，今年统一规划，按照农作物适应性能，实行了“谷子上山、玉米下川、高粱进沟”，做到了因地制宜，组织社员大搞工具改革，大造土化肥，解决了劳力、肥料不足等困难，整个生产水平比过去有了很大提高。特别是整个伏天没下雨，遭到了十六年未有过的大旱灾，公社组织了万余名抗旱大军，库、池、井、泉、河五水全用，三万多亩受旱禾苗得到了灌溉，今年不仅没减产，平均亩产量比去年提高15％。
    据河北日报消息　河北省棉花普遍丰收，据9月下旬初步统计，全省已摘籽棉三亿九千四百多万斤，根据各地实摘和预测，今年棉花可增产一至三成。
    今年，河北省的一千四百多万亩棉花，一般生长良好，落铃少，结桃多，吐絮早，纤维长，品级高。占棉田总面积四分之一的丰产方，棉花长的更为出色。盛产棉花的邯郸专区，今年预计可增产棉花三成左右。石家庄专区也比去年增产16.6％。
    棉花大丰收的原因，首先是党加强了领导、是政治挂帅、总路线挂帅的结果。各产棉区的专、县和人民公社，都有一名党委书记专管棉花生产；有些地方还建立起棉花办公室，形成了在党委领导下的一条强有力的管理棉花的战线。各级党委在大抓棉花生产当中，始终坚持了不断革命的思想，批判了右倾保守情绪，积极地推广了各种先进经验。产棉驰名全省的磁县，今年积极推广了高垅栽培棉花一万二千亩，育苗早播一万二千亩。据调查，高垅棉花比平垅棉花每株多结桃二点五五个，脱落率降低4.7％；阳畦育苗移栽的棉花比直播的平均每株多结零点八个桃；温室育苗移栽的棉花，在7月初就开始吐絮，到8月20日平均每亩已摘新花一百二十斤，创造了棉花提前成熟一个半月的奇迹。
    人民公社给全面实施农业“八字宪法”开辟了广阔园地，使棉花增产有了保证。邯郸专区公社化后，数百万社员打井开渠，修建坑塘水库、高埂畦田，把水浇地由二百六十万亩增加到九百六十万亩。土地都进行了大规模深翻。由于公社范围大，可以因地种植，统一划方，全部作到了南北垅，达到通风透光。全省共建立棉花丰产方一万多个，总面积达到三百七十多万亩。在种植方面，普遍推广了早播（提早五至十天）和宽窄行的种植方法，既密植又可以更好的通风透光，促使棉花丰产和减少落铃。同时，今年全省基本上普及了岱字棉十五号良种，并及时除治了虫害。
    获得丰收的广大棉农在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，干劲十足斗志昂扬，积极加强棉花后期管理，决心争取更多的超产。邯郸专区有九十六万多人投入棉花后期管理和收摘工作。磁县棉农展开“一升”（棉花全面升级）、“二促”（促早熟、促早开）、“三增”（增大桃、增老桃、增白花）、“四不丢”（棵上不丢眼睫毛、地里不丢落地棉、地头不丢、路上不丢）的竞赛，决心每亩再增五斤皮棉。今年棉花预计增产一倍多的吴桥县，五万多名社员掀起管理高潮，争取每棵再多座一至二个桃。（附图片）
