　　On Jintan Road
　　Zhou Ke
　　In the southeast corner of Shanghai's old city, there is a short street called Jintan Road. I have been to this road twice.
　　The first time was in the year the Marriage Law was being promoted. In the evening, on Jintan Road, groups of male and female residents gathered, discussing something as if a major event had occurred. Children, however, were clapping their hands at the entrance of Lane 14, singing, "Quarrelsome spirits, losing face is embarrassing!" I found a mediation committee member from the residents' committee and asked her what was happening. She told me with a wry smile that a fight had just broken out here. A woman named Ge Aju and a neighbor had fought all the way from the lane to Jintan Road.
　　Later, residents told me that Jintan Road had always been a place where "small quarrels happen every day, big quarrels every few days." The entrance of number 15 was a famous "quarrel headquarters," and Lane 14 was known as "the cursing lane." "The cursing lane" housed about thirty families, and more than ten pairs of "enemies" quarreled incessantly throughout the year.
　　Amidst the nationwide Great Leap Forward, news of the great changes on Jintan Road reached me, making me want to go and see it again. One afternoon in the summer of this year, I came to Jintan Road for the second time.
　　The street was quiet, with only the occasional laughter and singing of children from the nursery. A member of the residents' committee who greeted me said, "Now, the lane has organized production processing and collective cultural welfare projects. Everyone is busy with work and study, and they don't have time to quarrel."
　　No time to quarrel is one reason. But this cannot be the whole reason. I wanted to visit the embroidery group, where most of the women on Jintan Road worked.
　　The embroidery group was originally an advanced group. The group leader, Ding Gendi, was an active member of the lane, who had been a child bride. She had been a mediation committee member on Jintan Road for several years. She was warmhearted and fair, and well-respected by the residents. Since becoming the embroidery group leader last year, she has done well in production and study, and she also cares about everyone in their lives. One group member's child broke her arm and was so scared that she could only cry, not knowing what to do. Ding Gendi immediately put down her own work and helped her take the child to the hospital, registered her, got the medicine, and constantly comforted the mother and child. This touched the women very much. Not long after, a group member living at number 17 Jintan Road wanted to exchange houses with the lane's canteen. Her husband was not at home, and when the other women found out, they went together to help her move after work...
　　"Neighbors working together, it's hard to avoid conflicts, right? How do you solve them?" I asked the group leader. Ding Gendi nodded and told me a story about a democratic unity meeting.
　　Once, when Zhou Chengdi was embroidering on a woolen sweater, she joked to Zhang Heling, "Watch me embroider this child into a hunchback, like your son!" Zhang Heling's face fell. The other women saw this and thought, "Oh no!" Everyone on Jintan Road knew that Zhang Heling and her neighbor were not on good terms, precisely because the neighbor had said that Zhang Heling's son was "a hunchback and not growing fat." After Ding Gendi found out about this, she first chatted with Zhou Chengdi, telling her, "It's very unfortunate that someone's son is disabled. It's not good for you to joke like that!" Then she talked to Zhang Heling, "Everyone says that the women in our group are as united as sisters. Even if someone accidentally said something wrong, it's best not to hold it in your heart!" Later, at the democratic unity meeting, Zhou Chengdi sincerely apologized for not being careful with her words and making an excessive joke. As soon as Zhang Heling heard this, she was no longer angry.
　　The democratic unity meeting is a regular meeting stipulated by the residents' committee. Each group holds it once a month, where they engage in mutual criticism and self-criticism. This active atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism not only prompts residents to continuously improve their ideological awareness, but also replaces the old method of resolving conflicts through quarrels that had persisted on Jintan Road for a long time.
　　"But, some women may not be able to change their minds right away, then it all depends on doing individual work. For example, Ge Aju..." "Ge Aju, is that the 'quarrelsome spirit' who had a big fight on Jintan Road that year?" I interrupted Ding Gendi impatiently. Ding Gendi laughed and said, "She's already gotten rid of that nickname. Now she can make forty threads a day, almost catching up with the fast hands!" She led me to a short, middle-aged woman behind her and called out, "Ge Aju," introducing me to her.
　　Only then did I understand that Ge Aju was originally a rural girl. After marrying in Shanghai, her husband often worked away from home, returning home once a year, and their relationship was still good. But her mother-in-law disliked her, scolding her for being a country bumpkin, being stupid, often making things difficult for her, and speaking ill of her to her son. After being a new daughter-in-law for three years, she ate tear-soaked rice for three years. Once, Ge Aju hardened her heart and boldly had a big fight with her mother-in-law, which made her mother-in-law dizzy and speechless. Ge Aju thought this method was good, believing that those who are kind are bullied, and if you don't want to suffer losses, you must be three points fiercer than others. From then on, she didn't take her mother-in-law seriously and would curse at her at every turn. When neighbors saw that she was making too much of a scene, they tried to persuade her, but she ignored them, treating them all with harsh words. When her husband came home and learned about these situations, he had opinions about her, and she simply quarreled with her husband as well. After that, her husband didn't write to her all year round, and didn't even send her the monthly living expenses directly. In this way, Ge Aju was even more distressed and quarreled with others even more often.
　　After liberation, the neighborhood committee members talked to her about reason several times, criticizing her behavior as wrong, but she often admitted her mistakes during the day at the mediation meeting, but went out to scold people again at night. It wasn't until the Great Leap Forward last year that the neighborhood committee and the women's representatives mobilized the women, determined to break through the "cold corner," and decided to first not discriminate against her, but to start from caring about her pain, and also tell her the principle that disunity in the family and neighborhood is not conducive to building socialism, help her distinguish right from wrong, and dig out the root of her erroneous thoughts. Everyone talked to her separately to enlighten her. Just at this time, her husband's work unit also noticed their family life and did some work. With the cooperation of both sides, Ge Aju finally tearfully examined her long-term erroneous thoughts and behaviors, and expressed that she wanted to be a good family member of the staff. After she joined the embroidery group, everyone often talked to her and cared about her. In this way, Ge Aju really stopped looking for trouble with others.
　　That evening at dusk, I went to Lane 14 again. Turning into the T-shaped Lane 14, I heard a burst of arguing. What's going on? Another quarrel? Listening closely, some were saying that the lane was not as clean as others and should be cleaned regularly; others said that the work should be divided and contracted. It turned out that the residents were discussing the big cleanup to eliminate the seven pests tomorrow. A sharp-voiced woman said, "I'm responsible for sweeping the street." Another woman interjected jokingly, "Are you going to quarrel again?" (In Shanghai dialect, "sweeping the street" and "quarreling" sound similar.) A burst of happy laughter erupted in the lane.

### 金坛路上

　　金坛路上
　　周珂
    上海市旧城的东南角上，有一条短短的街道，叫金坛路。我到这条路去过两次。
    第一次去是在宣传婚姻法那年。傍晚，金坛路上，东一堆西一群聚集着的男女居民，都在纷纷议论，好像发生过什么重大事情。孩子们却在十四弄弄口拍着手唱：“吵架精，打破面皮难为情！”我找了一位居民委员会的调解委员，问她怎么回事。她苦笑着告诉我说，这里刚才打过一场架。一个名叫葛阿菊的妇女和邻居，从里弄里一直打到金坛路上。
    后来居民们又告诉我，这金坛路上从来就是“小吵天天有，大吵三六九”。十五号门口是出名的“吵架总会”，十四弄叫做“相骂里弄”。“相骂里弄”住着三十来户人家，整年到头吵闹不休的“冤家”就有十多对。
    祖国全面大跃进热潮中，传来了金坛路大变样的消息，使我不由产生了再去看看的愿望。今年盛夏的一天午后，我第二次来到金坛路。
    街上静静的，只有托儿所里不时传出孩子们的欢笑声和歌声。接待我的一位居民委员会委员说：“现在里弄里组织了生产加工和集体文化福利事业，大家忙着工作、学习，没有时间吵嘴啦。”
    没有时间吵，这是一个理由。可是这不能是全部理由。我想再到金坛路妇女最多的刺绣组去看看。
    刺绣组原来是个先进组。组长丁根弟是个童养媳出身的里弄积极分子，前几年做过金坛路的调解委员，为人热情、公正，很受居民敬爱。自从去年当上刺绣组长后，生产、学习搞得好，在生活上也很关心大家。有一个组员的孩子手臂跌坏了，吓得只会哭，不知如何是好。丁根弟立刻丢下自己的活计，帮她把孩子送到医院，代为挂号、取药，还不断安慰母子俩。这事使妇女们很感动。过不多久，住在金坛路十七号的一个组员要和里弄食堂交换房屋，而她的丈夫不在家，其他妇女知道后，下了班就一起去帮她搬家……
    “邻居们在一起工作，难保不发生矛盾吧？怎么解决呢？”我向组长提出了自己的疑问。丁根弟点点头，给我讲了一段开民主团结会的故事。
    有一次，周承弟在绒线衫上刺绣时，向张荷玲开玩笑说：“看我把这个孩子绣成驼背了，像你的儿子哩！”张荷玲的脸扳起来了。其他妇女看到这情形心想糟啦。金坛路上谁不知道张荷玲和她的邻居不和，正是为了邻居说了一声张荷玲的儿子是“驼背长不胖”呢。丁根弟知道这事后，先找周承弟聊天，和她说：“人家的儿子残废了，是很不幸的，你这样开玩笑不大好！”又找张荷玲谈心：“别人都说我们组里妇女团结得像亲姊妹一般，即使那个无心讲错了一句话，最好不要老记在心里！”后来，在民主团结会上，周承弟诚恳地检查了自己说话不知轻重，玩笑开得过分。张荷玲一听什么气都没有了。
    民主团结会是这个居民委员会规定的一种例会。各个组一个月举行一次，在会上互相展开批评自我批评。这种活跃的批评自我批评风气不但促使居民不断提高思想觉悟，而且代替了金坛路上长时期来以吵架解决矛盾的老方法。
    “可是，也有妇女一时扭不过头来，那就全靠个别做工作。比如葛阿菊……”“葛阿菊，就是那年在金坛路上大打架的‘吵架精’吗？”我性急地打断了丁根弟的话。丁根弟笑起来说：“她的这个绰号早摘掉了，人家现在每天要做四十根线，快要赶上快手了呢？”她引我走到一个小个子的中年妇女后面，叫了一声：“葛阿菊。”把我介绍给她。
    我这才弄清，葛阿菊本来是个农村姑娘，到上海结婚后丈夫经常在外地工作，一年回家一次，感情也还不错。可是婆婆却厌恶她，骂她乡下人，生得笨，经常作难她，还向儿子说她坏话。当了三年新媳妇，吃了三年泪泡饭。有一次，葛阿菊横了心，泼开胆子和婆婆大吵了一顿，把婆婆气得发昏，一句话也说不出来。葛阿菊觉得这办法好，认为人善受人欺，若要不吃亏，必须比人凶三分。从这次起，她就不把婆婆放在眼里，动不动破口大骂。邻居看她闹得太不像样了，劝劝她，她也不管好歹，一律恶言相向。她丈夫回家来知道这些情形，对她有意见，她索性和丈夫也吵翻了。以后丈夫整年不给她写信，连每月的家用也不直接寄给她。这样，葛阿菊更加痛苦，更是有事没事和别人吵了。
    解放以后，居委会委员好几次和她讲道理，批评她的行为不对，但往往白天调解会上她承认了错误，晚上却又去骂人了。直到去年大跃进时，居委会和妇代会发动妇女，决心突破“冷角”，决定首先不要歧视她，而要从关心她的痛苦出发，还要和她讲家庭、邻里不团结不利于建设社会主义的道理，帮她分清是非，挖出错误思想根子。大家分头和她谈心，启发她的觉悟。正好这时她丈夫的工作单位也注意到了他们的家庭生活，做了工作。两方面一配合，葛阿菊终于痛哭流涕地检查了自己长期来的错误思想和行为，表示要做个好的职工家属。她参加刺绣组后大家也常和她谈心，关心她。就这样，葛阿菊果然不再和人家寻事吵闹了。
    这天晚上黄昏时分，我还到十四弄去了。弯进丁字形的十四弄，就听到一阵争执的声音。怎么回事呢？又吵架了？走近一听，有的说里弄里比不上人家清洁，要定期打扫；有的说要分工包干。原来是居民们正在商量明天除七害大扫除的事情。一个尖嗓子的妇女说：“我负责扫街。”另一位妇女插进来打趣说：“你又要吵架？”（上海话扫街和吵架音相似）里弄里引起一阵愉快的笑声。（附图片）
