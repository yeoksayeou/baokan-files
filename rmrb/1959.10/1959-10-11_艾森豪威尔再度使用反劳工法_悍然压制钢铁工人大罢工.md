　　Eisenhower Reuses Anti-Labor Law
　　Brazenly Suppresses Steelworkers' Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: U.S. President Eisenhower, on the 9th, invoked the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to brazenly undermine the nearly three-month-long strike by 500,000 American steelworkers, attempting to suppress the rising American labor movement.
    After a meeting on the morning of the 9th with U.S. Secretary of Labor Mitchell, Attorney General Rogers, Secretary of the Treasury Anderson, and Secretary of Commerce Mueller, Eisenhower issued a statement declaring that after "careful study" he had concluded that allowing the steelworkers' strike to continue "would endanger the nation's health and safety," and that steelworkers must return to work immediately. He has, according to the Taft-Hartley Act, appointed a three-member committee to conduct a so-called "investigation" into the labor dispute in the steel industry and ordered the committee to submit a report to him as soon as possible within a week. After receiving the report, Eisenhower can order the court to force the workers to return to work for eighty days. The news that Eisenhower invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to undermine the steelworkers' strike aroused widespread anger among the steelworkers. Workers have condemned the U.S. government for acting as a loyal servant of Wall Street.

　　艾森豪威尔再度使用反劳工法
    悍然压制钢铁工人大罢工
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔9日援用塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，悍然破坏坚持将近三个月的美国五十万钢铁工人的大罢工，力图镇压美国高涨的工人运动。
    艾森豪威尔9日上午同美国劳工部长密契尔、司法部长罗杰斯、财政部长安德逊和商务部长米勒等举行会议后发表声明，扬言他经过“仔细研究”后已得出结论，让钢铁工人罢工继续下去“将危及国家的健康和安全”，钢铁工人必须立刻复工。他已根据塔夫脱—哈特莱法任命一个三人委员会对钢铁业劳资争端进行所谓“调查”，并命令这个委员会在一周内尽快向他提出报告。艾森豪威尔在接到报告后就可以要法院下令强迫工人复工八十天。艾森豪威尔援用塔夫脱—哈特莱法破坏钢铁工人罢工的消息传出以后，引起钢铁工人普遍的愤慨。工人纷纷谴责美国政府充当华尔街的忠仆。
