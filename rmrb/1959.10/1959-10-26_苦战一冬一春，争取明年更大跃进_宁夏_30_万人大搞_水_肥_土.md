Yinchuan Dispatch from our Newspaper, October 24th: Immediately after the conclusion of the autumn harvest and planting work, the vast rural areas of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region launched a vigorous mass movement on a large scale, centered on agricultural production this winter and next spring.

The number of people participating in this movement has reached more than 300,000, accounting for more than 80% of the total agricultural population.

This mass movement is centered on vigorously developing water conservancy, fertilizer production, and soil improvement, combined with vigorous development of sideline production, to drive the overall development of forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and commune industries, laying a solid foundation for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. The scale of this mass movement is much larger than the scale of the mass steelmaking movement in Ningxia last year.

In terms of water conservancy construction, more than 100,000 laborers have been mobilized in various places, determined to work hard through this winter and next spring to complete more than 80% of the water conservancy construction tasks for 1960. In the southern mountainous areas of Guyuan, Tongxin, Longde and other counties, more than 80,000 commune members have recently entered the construction sites. The 8,000 Hui and Han commune members in Tongxin County have completed the first phase of the main canal project of the Zhangjiawan Reservoir, turning large tracts of land in the Wangjiatun area, which had been arid for thousands of years, into paddy fields. In the Yellow River irrigation area, Jinji, Wuzhong, Helan, Pingluo, Huinong, Yongning, Yinchuan and other nine counties and cities, in order to complete the simple canal of the West Main Canal, which stretches 97 kilometers from Qingtongxia to Beibu of Helan Town, within two months, a 50,000-strong expeditionary force has been formed in various places and is successively heading to the construction site from their respective locations. The 20,000 engineering construction personnel at the Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Hub Project on the Yellow River are now working hard day and night to complete this year's total project volume 15 days ahead of schedule and to prepare for the cutoff in March next year.

In terms of accumulating and producing fertilizer, various places plan to accumulate enough fertilizer for all the summer fields needed for next year and more than 30% of the fertilizer needed for autumn fields before the Spring Festival; before the end of March next year, they will complete all the fertilizer needed for autumn fields and transport it to the fields. At present, in addition to organizing professional teams for accumulating and producing fertilizer, people's communes in various places are organizing more people to participate in the work of accumulating and producing fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Yinchuan, Lingwu, and Taole, the communes have accumulated more than 13.7 billion catties of fertilizer. Huinong County, which has the best fertilizer accumulation performance, has accumulated enough fertilizer for all the summer fields needed for next year, and has also prepared hundreds of thousands of carts of fertilizer for the autumn fields next year. In the process of accumulating and producing fertilizer, all localities have generally paid attention to the quality of the fertilizer. In terms of farmland construction, about 150,000 laborers, tens of thousands of livestock, and hundreds of tractors have been mobilized in various places, and they are stepping up the work of autumn plowing and land leveling. Hui and Han commune members are determined to plow all the land that should be plowed in the autumn before the ground freezes this year, and not let an acre of hard, unplowed land pass through the winter. The autumn plowing work is progressing rapidly, and more than 100,000 mu of hard, unplowed land is being turned over every day. While plowing the land in autumn, all localities have also vigorously carried out land leveling work. More than 80,000 people have been dispatched from counties in the Guyuan area and the Tongxin area to level the land. Various places in the Autonomous Region have also dispatched a large number of laborers, preparing to complete the small ridge gardenization work of one million mu in the coming winter and spring.

While vigorously developing water conservancy, fertilizer production, and soil improvement, all localities have organized a large army for sideline production, going deep into the mountains and valleys to collect wild plants and catch fish, preparing to increase the average sideline income per agricultural population by about ten yuan by the end of the year. In terms of animal husbandry, various places are currently carrying out crash grass harvesting and renovation of sheds and pens to ensure that sheep safely survive the winter.

All localities have adopted many measures in light of local conditions, rationally arranged labor and animal power, carried out the organization, allocation of labor, and preparation of materials, and organized expeditionary forces and professional teams according to needs, and dispatched capable cadres to participate in the leadership. In the movement, all localities adhered to putting politics in command, strengthened political and ideological work, and established party and league organizations and equipped them with political work cadres in all units where large corps operations were carried out. In addition, the Autonomous Region and various counties and cities have also established agricultural production movement committees to be responsible for handling the daily work and specific issues in the movement.

    苦战一冬一春，争取明年更大跃进
    宁夏30万人大搞“水”“肥”“土”
    本报银川24日电　宁夏回族自治区广大农村，在秋收秋种工作刚结束之后，立即开展了一个轰轰烈烈的以今冬明春农业生产为中心的大规模群众运动。
    参加这个运动的人数已达三十多万，约占全部农业人口80％以上。
    这个群众运动是以大搞水、肥、土为中心，并结合大力发展副业生产，以带动林、牧、渔等和公社工业的全面发展，为明年农业生产的更大跃进打好基础。这个群众运动的规模，比起去年宁夏地区大办钢铁运动的规模要壮阔的多。
    在水利建设方面，目前各地已出动十多万劳动大军，决心苦战一冬一春，完成1960年水利建设任务的80％以上。南部山区固原、同心、隆德等县各公社，最近已有八万多人走进工地，同心县的八千名回、汉族社员，已完成了张家湾水库的第一期干渠工程，使干旱了千百年的王家屯一带的大片土地变为水田。黄河灌溉区金积、吴忠、贺兰、平罗、惠农、永宁、银川等九个县、市，为了在两个月内完成从青铜峡到贺兰镇北堡的长达九十七公里的西总干渠的简易渠道，各地已组成五万多名劳动力的远征军，从所在地正陆续开赴施工地点。在黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程工地上的两万名工程建设人员，现在正为争取提前十五天完成今年工程总量和为明年3月截流做好准备工作日夜在苦战。
    在积肥、造肥方面，各地计划在春节以前，积够明年夏田所需的全部肥料和秋田所需肥料的30％以上；在明年3月底以前，完成秋田所需的全部肥料，并运送到地。目前各地人民公社除组织有积肥、造肥专业队外，正在组织更多的人参加积肥、造肥工作。据银川、灵武、陶乐等七个县的不完全统计，各公社已积肥一百三十七亿多斤，积肥成绩最好的惠农具各公社，已积够了明年所有夏田所需要的全部肥料，并给明年秋田也准备了几十万车肥料。各地在积肥、造肥中，都普遍的注意了肥料的质量。在农田建设方面，目前各地已出动十五万左右的劳动力和数万头牲畜以及数百台拖拉机，正在加紧进行秋翻地和平整土地工作。回、汉族社员决心在今年大地封冻以前，要翻完一切应该秋翻的土地，不让一亩板槎地越过冬天。现在秋翻工作进展很快，每天都有十多万亩板槎地被翻过来。各地在秋翻地的同时，还大力进行了土地平整工作。固原专区各县和同心一带，已派出八万多人平整土地。自治区各地还出动大批劳力，准备在今冬明春后完成一百万亩小畦园田化工作。
    各地在大搞水、肥、土的同时，都组织了一支副业生产大军，深入山区河谷采集野生植物和捕捞鱼类，准备到年底以前，每个农业人口平均增加副业收入十元左右。牧业方面，目前各地正在突击打草和整修棚圈工作，以保证羊只安全越过冬天。
    各地都因地制宜的采取了许多措施，合理的安排了劳力和畜力，进行了劳动力的组织、调配和物资的准备工作，并按照需要组织了远征军和专业队，调派了得力干部参加领导。各地在运动中，都坚持了政治挂帅，加强了政治思想工作，凡是大兵团作战的单位，都建立了党团组织，配备了政治工作干部。此外，自治区和各县、市还成立了农业生产运动委员会，负责处理运动中的日常工作和具体问题。
