    Red Flag and Grain
    Gao Yangshan
    When right-leaning opportunists were blowing cold air, a small number of rural cadres wavered. I heard the argument: "We want grain, not the red flag." It seems this was a concrete manifestation of "don't put politics in command." The thunderclap of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was a head-on blow to this argument. However, to prevent a resurgence, it is still necessary to talk about it again.
    "We want grain," that's correct. Isn't one of the goals of our Party's General Line, the roaring Great Leap Forward, and the masses enthusiastically running the people's communes to increase grain production in agriculture? We have consistently strived to produce more grain. But "don't want the red flag" is completely wrong. How can grain and the red flag be separated? With the red flag, there is grain; without the red flag, grain is difficult to obtain.
    These comrades have ideological problems. They only know that grain can be eaten, and the red flag cannot be eaten; but they don't know that only with the red flag can grain be eaten. They regard the red flag and grain as enemies, as if they can only have one and not both; they don't understand that today's grain not only grows from the land, but also grows on the red flag. The higher the red flag is planted, the more grain can be increased.
    If you don't believe it, look at an example of grain growing on the red flag:
    In Xiliu Village, Jiucheng People's Commune, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, more than 800 mu of land could not be planted with wheat due to waterlogging. However, after the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was conveyed there, the Party branch organized discussions, and all Party members immediately led the masses to drain water, digging more than 70 drainage ditches in two days, and dragging more than 800 mu of waterlogged land alive from under the water, planting wheat in time.
    We see that these more than 800 mu of wheat are indeed planted on the land, but when the land is soaked in water, it cannot be planted. To drain water, we must overcome the mood of relaxation and exert effort, which requires the red flag of the Party's General Line. Once the Party's red flag against right-leaning and encouraging effort is planted, more than 800 mu of land is immediately dragged out from under the water. Without this red flag, the wheat cannot be planted, and where does this grain come from?
    The commune members who were encouraged drained the water from more than 800 mu of land, and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party drained some of the right-leaning opportunism from the fields of people's hearts. The onslaught of right-leaning opportunist thoughts did indeed try to submerge our entire socialist construction cause; but our Party resolutely eliminated this thought, defended the socialist construction cause, and promoted the socialist construction cause.
    What is the red flag? The Party's General Line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement are the red flag. To increase grain production, the land must be plowed deeply and cultivated meticulously, more fertilizer must be applied, good seeds must be selected, water must be watered diligently, and it must be well managed to prevent insects and remove weeds, and it must also be able to ensure the fundamental cure and elimination of all drought and flood disasters. All of this cannot be done slowly and leisurely with scattered manpower. All of this requires a large-scale mass movement; requires unified operations by large corps; requires everyone to go all out and strive for upstream; requires striving for all the time that can be obtained, freeing up all the manpower that can be freed up; and also requires the reform of tools and necessary machinery. All of this can only be found under the red flag. Without the red flag of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and with right-leaning opportunist thoughts running rampant, our cause will be submerged. Holding high this red flag, we can always move forward by leaps and bounds! This year's wheat is planted more, faster, and better because of the red flag competition launched by the masses in various places. Aren't people saying this? "If it weren't for opposing right-leaning, holding high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, don't even think about planting so much good wheat!"

    红旗和粮食
  　高仰山
    右倾机会主义分子吹冷气的那当儿，一小部分农村干部中，曾经有些摇摆。我就听到过一种论调：“要粮食不要红旗”。看来，这正是“不要政治挂帅”的具体化。党的八届八中全会的春雷一响，对这种论调是一次当头棒喝。但是，为了防止死灰复燃，还有再说一说它的必要。
    “要粮食”，这是不错的。我们党的总路线，轰轰烈烈的大跃进，群众那样热情的大办人民公社，那目的之一，不也就是为了在农业生产方面增产粮食吗？我们一贯是要力争多产粮食的。但是“不要红旗”，却大错而特错了。粮食怎么能和红旗分开呢？有红旗就有粮食；没有红旗，粮食也就难以得到了。
    这些同志思想上是有毛病的。他们只知道粮食能吃，红旗不能吃；而不知道，只有有了红旗才能吃到粮食。他们把红旗和粮食看成冤家对头，仿佛它们只能有其一，不能兼得其二；而不懂得，如今的粮食不仅要从土地上生长，而且要在红旗上生长。红旗插得越高，粮食也才能增产得越多。
    不信请看红旗上长粮食的一个实例：
    河北省高阳县旧城人民公社的西留村，有八百多亩地因积水不能种麦子。可是党的八届八中全会的决议传达到那里以后，党支部组织了讨论，全体党员立即带动群众去排水，两天挖了泄水沟七十多条，把八百多亩积水地活活地从水下拖出来了，适时地种上了麦子。
    我们看，这八百多亩麦子的确种在土地上了，但是土地被水泡着的时候，是不能种的。要排水，就要克服松劲情绪，发挥干劲，这就需要党的总路线的红旗了。党的反右倾鼓干劲的红旗一插，八百多亩地立即从水下拖出来了。如果没有这红旗，麦子种不上，这粮食又从哪里来呢？
    鼓起了干劲的公社社员们排出了八百多亩地里的水，党的八届八中全会排出了一些人心田里的右倾机会主义的水。右倾机会主义思潮之袭来，的确曾想淹没我们整个社会主义建设事业；而我们党却坚决地排除了这种思潮，捍卫了社会主义建设事业，推进了社会主义建设事业。
    什么是红旗？党的建设社会主义总路线，大跃进，人民公社运动是红旗。要增产粮食，地要翻得深耕得细，肥要施得多，籽要选得好，水要浇得勤，还要好好管理，防虫、除草，更要能保证根治和排除一切旱涝灾害，这一切都不是分散的人力，慢慢腾腾的可以办到的。这一切都需要大规模的群众运动；需要大兵团的统一作战；需要人人鼓足干劲力争上游；需要争取一切可以取得的时间，腾出一切可以腾出的人力；还需要工具的改革和必要的机械，这一切的一切，只有在红旗下面才能找到。没有党的总路线，大跃进，人民公社的红旗，任右倾机会主义思潮泛滥，我们的事业就会被淹没。高举这红旗，我们就能永远大踏步前进！今年的麦子种得又多又快又好，就是由于各地群众开展了红旗竞赛而来的。人们不是这样说吗？“要不是反对右倾，高举总路线，大跃进，人民公社的红旗，就不要想种上这样多的好麦子！”
