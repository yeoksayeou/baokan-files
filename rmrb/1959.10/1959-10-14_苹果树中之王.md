　　The King of Apple Trees
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Xiangbo

　　In the ninth orchard of the State-owned Lüda Second Farm, there is a rare large "Guoguang" apple tree that attracts many plant enthusiasts. From a distance, the intoxicating fragrance wafts over; plump apples, as dense as grapes, reveal their red faces amidst the lush green leaves; branches as thick as bowls bend low with their heavy burden, forcing the workers to support them with dozens of poles each over ten feet tall. The large tree is mushroom-shaped. Members of minority group visiting delegations from Xinjiang, Guizhou, and other places curiously wanted to test how big the crown of the tree actually was. Thirty-two people, hand in hand, formed a large circle with a diameter of fourteen meters to barely encircle it. One visitor with great difficulty pushed aside the drooping, dense foliage, squeezed in to measure the trunk, and found the circumference was a full 2.46 meters. The trunk gives rise to nine main branches, extending in all directions. Three workers climbed to a high place and spent two hours counting, only to discover that the tree bore a total of 12,175 apples.

　　The number of fruits produced by this apple tree increases year by year. Last year, it produced 4,334 fruits, with a total weight of 3,634.68 jin. At that time, everyone was overjoyed with this new record, never expecting it would bear even more this year. The apples from this tree are crisp, sweet, and juicy, and 95% of the high-quality fruit are free from pests and injuries, with each weighing from four to eight liang.

　　The lifespan of a typical apple tree is forty to fifty years, but this tree is already forty-eight years old. However, it is still full of vitality, with a smooth, solid trunk, and not a single withered branch can be seen on the crown. Last year, as soon as the autumn winds began to blow, before the apples were even completely picked, workers were pulled out to turn the soil and implement multi-layered fertilization, ensuring the root system fully absorbed the fertilizer at the lower levels. Since the beginning of this year, the workers have continuously applied additional fertilizer, spraying urea, phosphate fertilizer, and nitrogen fertilizer on the leaves. In early summer, the drought was severe, and the large buds were on the verge of falling. The three large wells originally in the orchard could not meet the water needs after deep tilling, so the workers drilled wells and watered the trees overnight, so that the flowers and fruits on the tree quickly flourished again. On the basis of sufficient fertilizer and water, the workers implemented dense fruit retention, rational pruning, and achieved a balanced load for the large tree. The "Eight-Character Charter" rejuvenated the old tree, changed the regular pattern of "bumper years" and "lean years," and made the yield increase year after year.

　　苹果树中之王
　　新华社记者　张向波
    在国营旅大第二农场第九园里，有一棵罕见的大
  “国光”苹果树，吸引了许多植物爱好者。在离树还老远的地方，醉人的香气便阵阵扑来；只见密如葡萄的大苹果，在翠叶掩映中，露出红脸；碗口粗的树枝，被坠得弯下了腰，工人们只得用数十根丈把高的杆子把它支撑起来。大树形似蘑菇。来自新疆、贵州等地的少数民族参观团的团员们，好奇地要试一试树冠究竟有多大，三十二个人手接手地围了个直径十四米的大圆圈，才紧紧把它围拢过来。有位参观者好容易拨开下垂的茂密枝叶，钻进去量树干，干周足有二点四六米。树干派生着九个主枝，伸向四面八方。有三个工人攀登高处，点了两个小时，才数出树上共结苹果一万二千一百七十五个。
    这棵果树结果数量一年比一年多，去年结了四千三百三十四个果，总重量是三千六百三十四点六八市斤。当时大家为这个新纪录乐得心花怒放，不想今年结得更多。这棵树结的苹果脆甜多汁，无虫、无伤的优质果占95％，个重四两到八两。
    一般苹果树的寿命是四十到五十年，这棵树已过四十八龄。可是它现在还充满活力，树干光滑结实，树冠上见不到一丝枯枝。去年，秋风乍起，苹果还没摘完，果园就抽出人来翻地，实行了多层施肥法，使根系下部充分吸收肥料。今年以来，工人们又连续追肥，在叶子上喷洒尿素、磷肥、氮肥。初夏，旱灾重，肥大的蓓蕾眼看掉下来，园中原有的三个大井满足不了深翻后的用水需要，工人们又连夜打井、浇水，使树上的花、果很快又茂盛起来。在肥、水充足的基础上，工人们实行了密留果，合理剪枝，作到大树均衡负荷。“八字宪法”使老树回春，改变了“大年”“小年”的常规，使产量年年高升。
