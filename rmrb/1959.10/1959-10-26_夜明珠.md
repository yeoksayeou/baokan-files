    Night-Luminous Pearl
    He Caiwen, Wuhan Iron and Steel Industrial Installation Company
    At dusk, the sun's glow bathes the ten-mile steel city of Wuhan in a golden hue. Tens of thousands of workers going to and from work surge like spring tides towards factories, construction sites, and residential areas. A middle-aged man and a young man, engaged in cheerful conversation, swiftly walk through the ceaseless flow of people, coming from the open-hearth furnace construction site. Judging by their elated expressions, something extraordinary must have happened.

    The middle-aged man, waving his strong and vigorous arms, says with great enthusiasm, "Anti-Rightist, Go All Out, the Party Central Committee's call is like a welcome rain in a drought, so timely! To be honest, these six words from Chairman Mao seem to have given me another hundred pounds of strength." As he speaks, his slightly puffy but energetic eyes turn to the young man: "What about you, Miye? Why are you so quiet?"

    Zhong Miye still doesn't speak. He's thinking about how the youth shock team he leads lost in the competition against the veteran team today. The veteran team installed seven inter-column supports, while they installed less than five. As he thinks, he can't help but say, "Yukun, the Party calls on us to complete the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. We can't just be old oxen pulling a broken cart!"

    "That's right, we need to get on a swift steed and really go full speed ahead!" Zhong Miye's words are exactly what Ju Yukun is thinking, and he immediately asks Zhong Miye for his opinion: "Miye, let's come back and work after dinner. We must learn from the veteran workers' drive and not let them outpace us. We're youth shock troops, after all!"

    Zhong Miye glances at Yukun with full agreement, and then asks thoughtfully, "This is extra work. Do we need to tell the veteran workers?"

    "Absolutely not!" Ju Yukun stomps his feet in a hurry, puts his mouth close to Zhong Miye's ear and says, "We can only do it secretly, do it first and report later!" He says in a soft voice, afraid that outsiders will hear.

    Zhong Miye nods repeatedly and says, "Good idea, good idea! That way, after dinner, we'll go and find people separately and tell everyone not to say a word."

    The two walk and talk, and unknowingly arrive at the entrance of the cafeteria. They hastily finish their meal, throw down their chopsticks and bowls, and go to find people. By the time the shock troops return to the ingot stripping site of the open-hearth furnace, it is already dark.

    "Miye, what do we do without lighting? I'll go find an electrician..." A young man named Fang Zhonghou says and runs off. Ju Yukun hears this and rushes over, spreading his hands to block Fang:
  "You can't go! We must never reveal the secret!" As he speaks, he takes out a pair of pliers from his tool bag, runs in two steps and goes to connect the lights.

    In a moment, the spotlights come on. A group of smiling faces are illuminated in the bright light.

    A crisp whistle blows, and Zhong Miye gathers everyone together. Ju Yukun excitedly walks to the center of the crowd. Facing this group of fiery young men, he feels that there is no need to do any ideological mobilization. Instead, he repeatedly nags about the important principle of "pay attention to safety," fearing that if there is a personal injury, he will not be able to explain it to the master workers back at work. "...We will not stop until we are ahead of the veteran team!" As soon as Ju Yukun finishes speaking, the shock troops, like soldiers armed with knives and guns, quickly rush to their respective posts.

    The sounds of labor shatter the silence of the night. With rhythmic shouts, the young men use thick ropes to pull the metal supports to the top of the steel columns. Their arms are sore, blisters are rubbed on their hands, but they are still working hard, and their shouts are still so loud.

    "We've caught up, we've caught up with the veteran team!" Fang Zhonghou, who is tightening the screws high in the air, happily hammers on the steel column with his hand hammer, as if a performer is playing a victorious march.

    The shouts of "We've caught up" echo from high in the air to the ground. The young men exchange joyful glances with each other, and their excited moods cannot calm down.

    As they speak, they see a plump old man staggering towards them from a distance. Fang Zhonghou takes a closer look and exclaims, "Something's wrong!" As he speaks, he slides down the rope.

    Everyone looks in the same direction as Fang, and in an instant, everyone is silent.

    At this time, Ju Yukun has no choice but to straighten his back and walk to the old man who is panting heavily, saying in a low voice, like a student admitting his mistake to a teacher, "Forgive us, Master Li, just this once!"

    Eighth-grade master worker Li Yanguang's eyeballs are as big as eggs. He scrutinizes everyone one by one, and doesn't say a word for a full two or three minutes. This terrifying silence frightens the young men, and their hearts beat rapidly.

    "You little devils! You don't even call your master workers when you come to work overtime!" After a long time, Master Li finally pouts and mutters. The old master complains, "I ran to find you after dinner, preparing to discuss the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, but when I walked into your dormitory, there wasn't a single person. I thought you had gone to take a bath, but when I went to the bathhouse, I still couldn't find you..." As Master Li speaks, the young men cover their mouths, unable to stop themselves from laughing. "You sneaked off like this, I'm afraid the cafeteria didn't even prepare steamed buns for you!"

    The old master raises his head and examines the rows of newly installed metal supports one by one. The young men quietly watch the old master's expression, anxiously waiting for the old master's evaluation of their labor achievements. The old master nods in satisfaction again and again, while scolding with a smile, "You little devils, you are truly night-luminous pearls..." Suddenly, he points his index finger at the youth shock team leader's forehead, and says with a smile that is not a smile, "How about it, do you want to continue?" Zhong Miye doesn't dare to answer directly, signaling Ju Yukun to quickly come out and speak for everyone. Ju Yukun understands and walks up to Master Li, biting the bullet and saying, "There are only five more left in the entire workshop. Everyone wants to finish them in one go. Master Li! Please agree, we'll finish the job early!"

    As soon as Master Li hears this, he says nothing, clenches his left fist in his right palm, and bursts out a voice with all his heart: "Do it!" As he speaks, he climbs up to twenty meters in the air like a gust of wind.

    Looking at Master Li's tall figure, the young men smile, and immediately go to work buzzing like a group of industrious bees.

    夜明珠
    武钢工业安装公司　何才文
    傍晚，太阳的光辉把这十里钢城——武钢映的一片金色。成千上万上下班的工人，像春潮般涌上工厂、工地和住宅区。一个中年人和一个小伙子谈笑风生，穿过源源不断的人流从平炉工地快步走来，看他们那兴高采烈的神情，想必有什么不平凡的喜事。
    那中年人挥舞着健壮有力的手臂，兴致勃勃地说道：“反右倾，鼓干劲，党中央的号召就像干旱天的喜雨，多及时啊！说真的，毛主席说的这六个字，好像又给我增添了百斤力气。”说着，一双微微浮肿但精力充沛的眼睛转向小伙子：“你呢，米叶，你干吗老不说话呀？”
    仲米叶，还是没有说话，他在想，由他领导的青年突击组今天在和老年组的竞赛中输了。老年组安装了七个空当柱间支撑，而他们安装的却不到五当。想着想着，情不自禁地说道：“玉坤，党号召我们要提前三年完成第二个五年计划，我们不能老是老牛拉破车哇！”
    “对呀，我们要跨上千里马，来他个快马加鞭才行！”仲米叶说出了琚玉坤的心里话，他立刻征求仲米叶的意见：“米叶，吃罢晚饭再来干吧，我们要学习老师傅的干劲，决不能叫他们拉下。青年突击手嘛！”
    仲米叶满心赞同地瞅了玉坤一眼，若有所思地问道：“这是干额外活，用不用跟老师傅说一声呢？”
    “那还了得！”琚玉坤急的直跺脚，他尖着嘴巴凑在仲米叶耳背说，“只能偷着干，来他个先斩后奏！”他轻声轻气地说着，生怕局外人听了去。
    仲米叶连连点头说道：“好主意，好主意！这么着，吃罢饭我们俩分头去找人，叫大家谁也别吱声。”
    两个人且谈且走，不觉来到了食堂门口。他们俩一顿饭草草下肚，筷子碗一甩就找人去了。当突击手们重返到平炉的脱锭工地，天已经黑了。
    “米叶，没有照明咋办呢，我去找个电工师傅来……”一个名叫方忠厚的小伙子说着就跑。琚玉坤闻声赶去，双手一摊把小方拦住：
  “去不得，千万不敢泄露了秘密！”说着，从工具袋里掏出一把钳子，三脚两步跑去接灯去了。
    一会儿，聚光灯亮了。皎洁的灯光下映出一群笑脸。
    一阵清脆的哨声吹响，仲米叶把大家召集拢来。琚玉坤激动地走到人群的中央。面对着这班火球般的小伙子，他觉得没有必要作什么思想动员，倒是把“注意安全”的大道理婆婆妈妈地反复唠叨了好几遍，怕的是万一出个人身事故，回去没法向师傅交代。“……不赶在老年组的前面，决不罢休！”琚玉坤的话音刚落，突击手们就像手持刀枪的战士，迅速地奔上了各自的岗位。
    劳动的?喝声撕破了夜的寂静。随着一阵阵节奏均匀的吆喝声，小伙子们用粗大的绳索把一根根金属支撑拉上了钢柱的顶端。他们胳膊累酸了，手掌上磨出了血泡，一个个干的还是那么得劲，喊声还是那么宏亮。
    “赶上啦，赶上老年组啦！”在高空把螺丝的方忠厚，欣喜若狂地用手锤敲打着钢柱，仿佛演奏家在弹奏一曲胜利的凯歌。
    “赶上了”的呼喊声，从高空到地上嚷作一团。小伙子们彼此交换着喜悦的眼色，激荡的心情不能平静。
    说话间，只见远处一个胖胖的老人踉跄而来。方忠厚定睛一看，惊呼道：“不好了！”说着，顺着绳索滑了下来。
    所有的人一齐顺着小方的视线望去，一霎时，个个都不声不响了。
    这时琚玉坤只好挺直腰干走到那呼呼喘气的老人面前，像个犯了规的小学生向老师承认自己的过错那样，低声下气地说道：“原谅我们吧，李师傅，就这一次嘛！”
    八级老师傅李延广眼珠子鼓的有鸡蛋大，把所有的人逐个地打量了一番，足足有两三分钟之久没有说一句话。这可怕的寂静，吓的小伙子们心直跳。
    “你们这些小鬼！来加班连师傅也不叫一声了！”老半天，李师傅才撅着嘴嘟哝出这么一句。老师傅抱怨道：“我吃过晚饭就跑去找你们，准备讨论八中全会的公报和决议，谁知走进你们宿舍，连个人影也不见，我当你们是洗澡去了，走到澡堂还是不见你们……”李师傅说着，小伙子们一个个捂着嘴忍不住要笑出声来。“你们这样偷偷摸摸跑来了，食堂里恐怕连个馒头也没有给你们准备呐！”
    老师傅仰着头，沿着一排排刚刚安装上去的金属支撑逐一审视起来。小伙子们悄悄地注视着老师傅的脸色，焦急地等待着老师傅对自己劳动成果的评价。老师傅一面连连满意地点着头，一面笑骂着：“你们这些小鬼头，真是一颗颗夜明珠啊……”突然他伸出食指在青年突击组长额前点了点，似笑非笑地说道：“怎么样，还要干吗？”仲米叶没敢直接回答，示意琚玉坤快快出来替大家说话。琚玉坤会意地走到李师傅跟前，硬着头皮说道：“整个车间就剩下这么五当了，大家都想一口气干完算了呢。李师傅！你就同意了吧，早干完早交工嘛！”
    李师傅一听，二话没说左拳击在右掌上，全身心迸发出一个声音：“干！”说着，像一阵风似地爬上了二十米高空。
    望着李师傅那高大的身影，小伙子们笑了，立刻又像一群勤劳的蜜蜂一样轰轰地干了起来。
