　　Happy Event
　　By our reporter Jin Feng
　　Joyful firecrackers crackled and popped. The forty-year-old groom, Tian Yuanlin, kowtowed to the portrait of Chairman Mao. Amid the children's laughter, his thirty-six-year-old bride, Shi Wenzhen, also hurriedly bowed. At this moment, his father, old man Tian Jiabao, and his mother had tears of happiness in their eyes, their smiles wide: "A worry of twenty years, finally fulfilled today!" At this moment, his second brother, Tian Yuancheng, third brother, Tian Xiaozhu, second sister-in-law, Wei Jinfeng, and third sister-in-law, Zhang Baohua, also smiled, holding their children. Their honest and kind eldest brother had worked hard for their happiness for half his life, willing to postpone his own marriage for twenty years, and today his wish has finally come true. How could they not be happy? Even Yuancheng's eight-year-old daughter, Dongzhen, and Xiaozhu's four-year-old daughter, Donglian, were smiling, their little mouths pursed: laughing at their uncle wearing a new suit today, his face beaming; laughing at so many guests coming to the courtyard, as if all the children and half the adults in the village had run here.
　　The children swarmed into the bridal chamber to see the bride. The new room was painted snow-white. The kang was covered with a phoenix-and-peony printed bed sheet, with four new floral quilts neatly folded. On the west wall hung a reproduction of Chairman Mao's oil painting. The warm autumn sun shining through the skylight glass illuminated Chairman Mao's portrait. Chairman Mao was wearing a silver-gray autumn coat, radiant, with a kind smile, looking at this happy newlywed couple. On either side were large red couplets, the top line reading "The commune brings happiness," and the bottom line reading "The bumper harvest forges a good marriage." Another wall was covered with New Year pictures of "The Romance of the Western Chamber," "The Butterfly Lovers," and "The Legend of the White Snake." The room was filled with joy. The bride, Shi Wenzhen, was originally from this village (Zhangxiantun Brigade, Anfeng Commune, Anyang County, Henan), and today she was dressed in entirely new clothes. She wore a black silk jacket and black soft satin pants, pink socks, and black straight-twill single shoes. Her hair was combed sleek and shiny, and her face glowed with a blush, making her look very young. The children stared at her with surprised eyes, and some old women pointed and said, "Is this Juzi's mother? She doesn't look like it!"
　　Twelve years ago, Juzi's father died when she was just one year old, and twenty-four-year-old Shi Wenzhen stayed with her young daughter and elderly in-laws. At that time, this place had just been liberated, and widow remarriage was unthinkable. In 1950, the Marriage Law was promulgated, and many unfortunate women broke free from the shackles of feudal ethics and found their own happiness. Some people also advised Shi Wenzhen to remarry. But the kind Shi Wenzhen could not bear to abandon the old and the young, and never left. Year after year, she took care of the food and the heating, busy in the fields and busy at home. Last year, when the commune was established, she joined the work in the canteen, and her brow began to relax. Her parents-in-law passed away one after another, and the commune helped her take care of the funeral arrangements. She had no more worries, and at this time many people advised her to remarry again. After thinking it over, Tian Yuanlin, who cooked with her in the commune canteen, was the most agreeable to her. The two of them worked together, ate from the same pot, and though it was only a few months, they understood each other better than they had in the past ten years of living in the same village. It may be hard to believe, but Shi Wenzhen, who had lived for thirty-six years, fell in love for the first time. She loved this honest, kind, hardworking, and considerate farmer with all the passion of a woman. Now, the road ahead of her is wide and open, she loves openly and honestly, she marries openly and honestly, no one stops her, and no one gossips, but only casts well-meaning and blessing eyes around. Only a distant uncle of her family, whose mind was still somewhat feudal, said:
　　"If you're going to go, go far away, not in the same neighborhood, it's shameful!" He was immediately criticized by the village branch. Her husband's brothers and sisters-in-law wanted to seize her house and furniture (in the past, when a widow remarried, she couldn't take anything with her, she could only leave with her bare hands), but the branch also came out to protect her, allowing her to take her things and marry into Tian Yuanlin's family, leaving the house to her daughter. Originally, she was always worried that if she remarried, she would have to separate from her daughter. Now, that was solved. They were in the same village, eating in the same canteen, and Tian Yuanlin's family didn't object to her daughter coming over at all. She had preserved both the happiness of being a mother and the happiness of being a lover. How could she not be grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Commune for bringing her such great happiness as she faced Chairman Mao's portrait?
　　The groom, Tian Yuanlin, with a smiling face, went in and out, busy entertaining guests. Before liberation, his family had many people but little land. He and his father, two adults, did odd jobs and ran small businesses, braving the wind and rain, but still couldn't feed the family. No one ever came to propose marriage to him. After the liberation, land was distributed, and his family's life just began to breathe, but he was already over thirty. His two younger brothers had found their own partners and got married. His age meant he could not expect a young woman to marry him; and women who had been married had life experience, and seeing that his family had many people and lived frugally, they were unwilling to marry him. Besides, the two brothers soon had children, and with more than ten people in the family, life was not easy. He wholeheartedly helped his father and brothers support the family, and his own marriage was delayed for ten years. It wasn't until the commune was established and he worked in the canteen that he got close to Shi Wenzhen. He saw that she worked well, lived carefully, and had a gentle disposition, and unknowingly love arose from respect. Like Shi Wenzhen, this forty-year-old farmer had finally found his own late happiness.
　　His father, old man Tian Jiabao, was so happy that he was pacing around the house, not knowing what to do. Forty-one years ago, when he first started a family, the burden of life immediately weighed on his shoulders. Three broken houses and two acres of graveyard land were his entire fortune. Three sons and a daughter were born in succession, and he had no choice but to do odd jobs for people during the busy farming season, and do some small business during the slack season. He finally struggled until the liberation, and the land reform distributed land. Yuancheng and Xiaozhu both married wives, and five grandchildren were born one after another. In 1956, he joined the advanced cooperative, and the crops were hit by hail, and he borrowed more than four hundred yuan from the state. In 1957, the year was good, and the whole family worked seven hundred and sixty-six labor days, with a dividend of eight hundred and eighty-three yuan. After food and expenses, he repaid part of the state loan, and the family's life began to improve. By the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the establishment of the People's Commune had greatly changed his family's life. All three sons, two daughters-in-law, plus the old man, all went to work, working a total of one thousand five hundred and fifty-four labor days (more than double the previous year), and in addition to the fact that the whole family of eleven did not have to pay for food, they also received a dividend of nine hundred and sixteen yuan. Adding the fact that the second son entered the factory and received a salary every month, the whole family's net income was one thousand two hundred and seventy yuan, an increase of 50% over 1957, equal to four times the income of 1956. All the debts were paid off, and the whole family, big and small, added more than fifty pieces of single,夹, cotton,绒, and线clothing. This year his family's income is even greater. In addition to not paying for food, the whole family of thirteen can earn more than one thousand three hundred yuan in wages. If the cost of food is included, the income would be one thousand nine hundred and eighty-one yuan, an average of one hundred and fifty-two yuan per person. Now the old man can enjoy a life of leisure, taking care of his grandchildren at home with his wife, and going to Shaojiatun for a drink in a few days. He has never had such a comfortable life. Now, he is beaming with joy, drinking tea and chatting with his old sister and brother-in-law.
　　The second son, Tian Yuancheng, was riding his bike back from the cotton processing factory. Last year, as soon as the commune was established, he was transferred to the factory. Every month, except for the cost of food, all the money was given to his father. Part of the money for his eldest brother's wedding this time was brought back by him. In this big family, brothers, sisters-in-law, father and son, and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are all filled with mutual respect, love, mutual assistance, and mutual concession. In difficult days, they never quarreled because of lack of firewood and rice. Today, when they have enough to eat and wear and live a comfortable life, the sons and brothers are willing to make their father and eldest brother, who have suffered a lot in the past, live more comfortably.
　　The third son, Tian Xiaozhu, who is the production team leader, is a good-tempered young man who smiles before he opens his mouth, and also works very well. While he was busy entertaining guests, he also took time to exchange production opinions with the cadres of his team: the harvested corn must be threshed quickly, and the cotton should also be picked a second time. According to their estimates, the cotton is growing even better than last year, and each mu can yield one hundred and fifty to sixty jin of ginned cotton.
　　The second daughter-in-law, Wei Jinfeng, and the third daughter-in-law, Zhang Baohua, were busy cooking in the kitchen. Wei Jinfeng is twenty-nine years old this year, straightforward, outspoken, and capable. Her maiden family is from Bianjiazhuang. She was a child bride in Zhangjiazhuang at the age of thirteen, and was trafficked to the house of the landlord Xu Laoze in this village to be a maid, and her life was very miserable. In 1947, the Eighth Route Army came, the landlord fled, and she was liberated, and married the second son, Tian Yuancheng. From the time she married at seventeen, she spent her days around the stove and the grinding table. As soon as the commune was established and the canteen was set up, she was liberated from the stove and energetically threw herself into field labor. She could earn one and a half labor days a day picking cotton, and twenty-seven points a day for fetching water and watering cotton; pulling the drill and hoeing the ground, she worked like a man. She also received wages like a man. Now she is no longer just in a subordinate position in the family, doing the cooking and washing clothes, but is a "worker" who is equal to her husband, younger uncle, and elder uncle. In the past, she had to ask the head of the family for money to buy an inch of cloth; now she has her own wages. From last year to this year, she has made three sets of single clothes, one set of cotton clothes, and also bought绒clothing, more than she made in her more than ten years of marriage. She had never worn洋布before, but now she wears卡机布. In order to be able to go to work on rainy days, she also bought油布and rubber shoes. Now she can't live without the canteen. Today she is helping to celebrate her uncle's wedding, and she is patiently cooking in the kitchen for this one day.
　　The dishes were cooked and the rice was fragrant, and the whole family began to eat. The old couple sat at the head of the table, with three pairs of sons and daughters-in-law across from them, with five grandsons and granddaughters, and at the bottom were the married daughters and goddaughters, who had all rushed back to drink喜酒. The family of fifteen sat around the table, eating and laughing. At this time, the comrade from the commune took a family portrait for them.

　　喜事
　　本报记者　金凤
    欢乐的鞭炮声噼噼啪啪地响起来了。四十岁的新郎添元林朝着毛主席的像磕下头去。在孩子们的哄笑声中，他的三十六岁的新娘史文珍也慌忙弯腰鞠了一躬。这时，他的父亲添家宝老汉和他母亲眼中噙着幸福的泪花，笑得合不拢嘴：“耽了二十年的心事，今天总算如愿啦！”这时，他的二兄弟添元成、三兄弟添小柱和二弟媳魏金凤、三弟媳张宝花抱着他们的孩子也都笑开了。他们的忠厚老实的大哥为了他们的幸福操劳了半辈子，甘愿将自己的婚事推迟二十年，今天终于如愿了。他们怎能不高兴？就是元成的八岁的闺女冬珍、小柱的四岁的闺女冬莲也都抿着小嘴不住地笑：笑他们的大爷今天穿上一身新衣服，脸上红光满面；笑满院子来了这么多客人，仿佛全村的孩子和一半大人都跑到这儿来了。
    孩子们一窝蜂拥到新房来看新娘了。新房刷得雪白。炕上铺着凤凰卧牡丹的印花床单，整整齐齐叠着四床新花被。西墙上挂着毛主席的油画复制像。从天窗玻璃上射进的和煦的秋阳，正照在毛主席的像上。只见毛主席披着银灰色的秋大衣，光采焕发，含着慈祥的微笑，看着这一对幸福的新婚夫妇。两旁是一对大红对联，上联写的是“喜公社带来幸福”，下联写的是“庆丰收缔结良缘”。另一面墙上挂满了西厢记、梁山伯祝英台和白蛇传的年画。房中一片喜气洋洋。新娘史文珍原是这村（河南安阳县安丰公社张显屯大队）的人，今天浑身上下也打扮得焕然一新。她上身穿的是一件玄色绸夹袄，下面穿一条黑软缎夹裤，脚上是粉红洋袜，黑直贡呢单鞋。头发梳得溜光乌亮，脸上透出一团红晕，看来竟显得十分年轻。孩子们都睁大惊异的眼睛看着她，一些老婆婆也指指点点的道：“这是菊子她娘吗？看起来不大像哩！”
    十二年前，刚满一岁的菊子死了父亲，二十四岁的史文珍守着这个小闺女和年老的公婆。那时这里刚刚解放，寡妇改嫁是连想也不敢想的事情。1950年婚姻法颁布了，很多不幸的妇女冲出了封建礼教的囚笼，找到了自己的幸福。有人也劝史文珍改嫁。但善良的史文珍忍不得撇舍下老的老、小的小，一直没肯走。就这样，一年到头，她张罗着吃的又张罗烧的，忙了地里又忙家里。去年公社成立，她在食堂里参加了工作，眉心开始舒展了。她公公婆婆相继去世，社里帮助她料理了后事。她再无牵挂，这时又有不少人劝她改嫁。她想来想去，和她一起在公社食堂做饭的添元林最投她的心意。两个人同在一起劳动，同在一口锅吃饭，虽则不过短短几个月，但比过去同在一村住了十几年还了解得深。说来也许叫人不相信，活了三十六年的史文珍第一次恋爱了。她以一个女人的全部热情来爱着这个忠厚老实、又勤快、又体贴人的实心实意的庄稼汉。如今，在她面前的道路是坦坦荡荡的，她堂堂正正地爱人，堂堂正正地嫁人，没人阻拦，更没人说闲话，周围投过来的是好意的祝福的眼光。只有她本家一个堂叔，脑袋瓜还有些封建，说了句：
  “要走，走得远远的，本街本坊的，丢人露丑！”立即遭到村支部的批评。她夫家的兄嫂，想要霸占她的房屋家具（过去寡妇出嫁，什么东西也不能带，只能走一个光身），支部也出来保护了她，让她带上她的东西嫁到添元林家，房屋留给她的女儿。本来她总担心，如果要改嫁，怕要和女儿分离。如今可好了，就在一个村里，都在一个食堂吃饭，添元林家根本不反对她女儿跟过来。作为母亲和作为爱人的两种幸福她都保存住了，这怎么能叫她不对着毛主席的像感激共产党、感激人民公社带给她这种巨大的幸福呢？
    新郎添元林笑容满面，出出进进，忙着招待客人。解放以前他家人口多，没什么土地，他和父亲两个成年打短工、跑小买卖，风里来雨里去，还糊不住家中几张嘴，从来也没有人上门给他提过亲。解放以后分了土地，他家生活刚刚喘过气来，他的年纪已经过了三十。两个年轻兄弟都自己找了对象，结了婚。他的年龄不能指望年轻姑娘会嫁给他；而结过婚的女人都有生活经验，看到他家人口多，日子过得紧，也都不愿意嫁给他。再说，两个兄弟不久都添下孩子，家中十多口人，日子也不宽裕。他一心一意帮助父亲和兄弟支撑一家的生活，自己的婚事一拖就是十年。直等到公社成立，在食堂做饭，才接近了史文珍。他看她劳动好，生活过得仔细，脾性又温柔，不觉由敬生爱。和史文珍一样，这个四十岁的农民也终于找到了自己的迟来的幸福。
    他的父亲添家宝老汉，直乐得在家中转来转去，不知如何是好。四十一年以前，当他刚一成家，生活的担子立即压到他肩头。三间破屋，二亩坟地就是他的全部家业。三个儿子、一个闺女接连生下来，他只好农忙时给人打短工，农闲时做些小买卖。好容易熬到解放，土改分了土地，元成、小柱都娶了媳妇，五个孙儿女一个接一个的生出来。1956年入了高级社，庄稼遭了雹灾，又向国家贷款四百多元。1957年年成好，全家做了七百六十六个劳动日，分红八百八十三元，除了吃用，还了国家一部分贷款，家中生活开始好转。到大跃进的1958年，成立了人民公社，他家生活就大变样了。全家三个儿子、两个媳妇加上老汉全部出工，共做劳动日一千五百五十四个（比上年增加一倍多），除了全家十一口吃饭不要钱，还分红九百一十六元。加上二儿子进了工厂，月月拿工资，全家净收入一千二百七十元，比1957年增加50％，等于1956年收入的四倍。所有的债务全部还清，全家大大小小共添了单、夹、棉衣、绒衣、线衣等五十多件。今年他家收入更多，全家十三口除吃饭不要钱，光工资可收入一千三百多元。如算饭钱，收入就有一千九百八十一元，每人合一百五十二元。如今老汉可享清福了，和老伴在家照看照看孙儿女，过几天就上邵家屯喝点酒。他一辈子没有过这么舒心的日子。现在，他正眉开眼笑，和他的老姐姐和内弟在一起饮茶说笑。
    老二添元成这时正从棉花加工厂骑车赶回来。去年公社一成立，就调他进了工厂，每月工资除饭钱外，所有的钱都交给他的父亲。这次他大哥结婚的钱，有一部分就是他拿回来的。在这个大家庭里，兄弟之间、妯娌之间、父子婆媳之间，充满了互敬互爱、互助互让的精神。在艰难的日子里，他们从没有因为缺柴少米而打打吵吵，在今天这样有吃有穿、生活过得宽裕的时候，做儿子的、做兄弟的都愿意让过去吃过很多苦头的父亲和大哥生活得更舒坦些。
    当了生产队长的老三添小柱是个未张口先笑的、脾气温和的青年，劳动也很好。他一面张罗客人，还抽空和自己队的干部交换了一下生产上的意见：收起的玉米要赶紧打场，棉花也该摘第二遍。据他们估计，今年棉花长得比去年更好，每亩能收皮棉一百五六十斤。
    在厨房里忙着做饭做菜的是老二媳妇魏金凤和老三媳妇张宝花。魏金凤今年二十九岁，心直口快，爽朗能干。她娘家是边家庄人，十三岁到张家庄当童养媳，被人拐卖到这村的地主许老则家中当婢女，生活十分悲惨。1947年八路军来到，地主逃跑了，她才得到解放，和老二添元成结了婚。从她十七岁过门起，她就成年围着锅台、碾台转。公社一成立，食堂办起来，她从锅台边解放出来，精力充沛地投入田间劳动。摘棉花她一天能挣一个半劳动日，挑水浇棉花一天能挣二十七分；拉耧锄地，她和男子一样的干。她也和男子一样领到工资。现在她在家庭中再也不仅仅是做做饭、洗洗衣服的从属的位置，而是和她的丈夫、小叔、大伯一样平起平坐的“出力气的”了。过去买一寸布，也要伸手向当家的要钱；现在她有了自己的工资，从去年到今年她做了三身单衣、一身棉衣、还买了绒衣，比她结婚十多年中做的还要多。以前她就没穿过洋布，现在穿上了卡机布。为了下雨天能出工，她还买了油布和胶鞋。现在她再也离不开食堂了。今天是在给大伯办喜事，她才耐着性子在厨房里做这一天饭。
    菜熟饭香，全家开始吃饭。老夫妇俩坐在上席，打横是三对儿子和媳妇，带着五个孙儿、孙女，下首是出了嫁的亲闺女和干闺女，都赶回来喝喜酒了。一家十五口团团围着桌子坐着，又吃又笑。这时，公社来的同志给他们拍下了一张全家福的照片。
