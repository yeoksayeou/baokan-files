　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan – A great joyous event has occurred in the rural production and people's lives of Shanxi Province: fish farming has greatly developed in the first year of communization, and a bumper harvest has been achieved. Fresh fish produced in the province are now being sold in large quantities in cities such as Taiyuan and Datong, and in some rural market towns. Among them are not only northern carp, crucian carp, and catfish, but also Yangtze River black carp, grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, and Guangdong carp that have settled down in Shanxi Province.
　　Judging from the fishing situation, the fish in various places are growing very well. The three fish ponds in Yuncheng and Wenxi counties in the southern Shanxi plain alone harvested 200,000 jin of mature fish, equivalent to the province's total fish production last year. In the northern Saiwai area, the Siercun fish pond in the suburbs of Datong City caught 12,000 jin of mature fish in one net before National Day. The Malianying production team of the Huangling People's Commune in the suburbs of Taiyuan City also harvested 3,000 jin of fish this spring from a two-mu fish pond.
　　Before liberation, water conservancy in rural Shanxi Province was underdeveloped, and there was very little fish farming, generally limited to wild fishing. Some farmers in mountainous areas had never even seen fish. After liberation, with the great development of water conservancy construction, various places carried out trial farming and focused on development. By 1958, the area of fish farming had developed to more than 70,000 mu. After communization last year, the difficulties in manpower, material resources, and financial resources for developing fish farming, as well as the problems in water resources and fishing tools, have been further resolved. Therefore, the area of fish farming in the province has rapidly increased to more than 270,000 mu, an increase of nearly three times compared to before communization. Now, fish are being raised in most of the 72 counties and cities in the province, except for a few areas.
　　To adapt to the development of this new undertaking, Shanxi Province has established specialized leading organizations from the province to the county level, and has also established an aquatic products school specifically for training aquatic technology personnel for people's communes, and has established seven state-owned fish farms, which will gradually be built into fishery bases.

### 山西养鱼水面一年扩大近三倍

　　山西养鱼水面一年扩大近三倍
　　新华社太原讯　山西省农村生产和人民生活上出现了一桩大喜事：公社化第一年养鱼事业大发展，而且获得了丰收。本省自产的鲜鱼目前已在太原、大同等城市和部分农村集镇上大量上市。其中不仅有北方的鲤鱼、鲫鱼、鲶鱼，而且有在山西省安家落户的长江青鱼、草鱼、鲢鱼、鳙鱼和广东的鲤鱼。
    从捕捞的情况看，各地鱼儿成长得都很好。仅晋南平原运城、闻喜县的三个渔池，就捕捞了二十万斤成鱼，相当去年全省的鱼产量。晋北塞上地区大同市郊寺儿村渔池，国庆前夕一网就打捞成鱼一万二千斤。太原市郊黄陵人民公社马连营生产队今年春天在二亩大的鱼池里养的鱼，也捕捞了三千斤。
    解放前，山西省农村水利事业不发达，养鱼的很少，一般只限于野生野打。有些山区农民甚至没有见过鱼。解放后，随着水利建设的大发展，各地进行了试养和重点发展，到1958年养鱼水面发展到七万多亩。去年公社化以后，发展养鱼事业的人力物力财力上的困难和水利资源、打捞工具等方面的问题，都进一步得到解决，因此全省养鱼水面迅速增加到二十七万多亩，比公社化以前增加了将近三倍。现在全省七十二个县、市，除个别地区外，绝大部分都养上了鱼。
    适应这一新事业的发展，山西省从省到县建立了专业领导机构，并且创办了一所专为人民公社培养水产技术人材的水产学校，建立了七个国营渔场，以此为中心逐步建成渔业基地。
