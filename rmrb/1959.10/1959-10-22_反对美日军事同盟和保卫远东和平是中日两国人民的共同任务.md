    During the visit of the Japanese Communist Party delegation to China, Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with the Japanese Communist Party delegation headed by Comrade Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and held warm and cordial talks. The delegations of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Japan also held talks, and on October 20, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Sanzo Nosaka, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Japan, signed a joint statement of major historical significance on behalf of the central committees of the two parties. The talks between the two parties of China and Japan, as stated in the joint statement, will help strengthen the unity between the two parties of China and Japan and help develop the traditional friendship between the two peoples of China and Japan. The joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people to oppose the war and aggression policies of US imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces, are of great importance for safeguarding world peace, especially for safeguarding peace in the Far East.
    The most ferocious enemy of the people of the world—US imperialism, with the aim of dominating the Far East and enslaving the Japanese and Asian people, has actively controlled Japan and fostered Japanese militarism since the end of World War II, turning Japan into a US military base. This has seriously damaged the Japanese people's cause of striving for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, and at the same time, has posed a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. Recently, US imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces, have further colluded with each other and acted in collusion, and are working hard to revise the US-Japan Security Treaty, strengthen the open military alliance between the two countries, and become enemies of the Japanese and Asian people. Under the direction of the United States, the Japanese reactionary forces are also stepping up their efforts to deprive the Japanese people of their democratic rights, preparing to revise the constitution, actively carrying out rearmament including nuclear weapons, and under the banner of "US capital and Japanese technology cooperating to develop Southeast Asian resources," are carrying out economic and political expansion activities on a large scale. This situation is a disaster for the Japanese people and a new serious threat to all peace-loving countries and people in Asia and the world, and must arouse people's high vigilance.
    Japan was once a militaristic imperialist country. After World War II, the main part of Japanese monopoly capital, which was the foundation of imperialism, developed under new conditions and formed a Japanese traitorous monopoly capital group closely integrated with and controlled by US monopoly capital. Under the support of US capital, the capital and production of this monopoly group have become more concentrated than before the war, and its control over Japan's important industries has also been strengthened more than before the war. Although Japanese imperialism lost its colonies due to its defeat, Japan's economy has recovered and developed relatively rapidly in recent years. By August of this year, Japan's industrial and mining production had reached 2.7 times the pre-war level, exceeding the highest level during World War II (1944) by 1.1 times; however, Japan's export trade has so far only recovered to the pre-war level. The contradiction between Japan's production and market is expanding day by day. Under such circumstances, Japanese monopoly capital is using the protection of the United States to strengthen its capital export in various ways in order to establish and expand its struggle positions for seizing raw material producing areas and sales markets. The rule of the Japanese financial oligarchs, through the integration of monopoly organizations and state power, is also more direct and blatant than ever before. Nobusuke Kishi himself and his government are representatives of the Japanese traitorous monopoly capital group. All this proves that, with the backing of the United States, the Japanese reactionary forces are attempting to make Japan a militaristic imperialist country again.
    The reactionary policies carried out by the Kishi Nobusuke government at home and abroad have emerged in the situation of both depending on the United States and forming an alliance with the United States. As far as US imperialism is concerned, a militaristic Japan controlled by the United States is the main accomplice and the largest military base for US aggression in Asia. This role of Japan has been fully demonstrated in the US war of aggression against Korea. After the US-made unilateral Treaty of San Francisco came into effect in April 1952, the US occupation authorities withdrew from Japan, but through the US-Japan Security Treaty and a series of other agreements signed at the same time as the Treaty of San Francisco, the United States still maintained a semi-occupation status over Japan politically and militarily. US troops are still stationed in Japan, US military bases are distributed throughout Japan, and the Japanese territories of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands are still controlled by the United States. The United States also maintains control over Japan economically through loans, military orders, trade, and the activities of US private capital in Japan. The American imperialist yellow culture and lifestyle imported into Japan along with US control are also corrupting the Japanese people. All this is bound to form Japan's subordination to the United States in the US-Japan alliance. On the other hand, although Japan is a defeated country, it is not an economically backward country, but an economically developed capitalist country. In order to carry out aggression in Asia, US imperialism needs to use Japan's industrial capacity and military potential to make Japan pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States and drive Japan to form a subordinate alliance with the United States. On the Japanese side, the Japanese reactionary forces also vainly attempt to use the power of the United States, relying on an alliance relationship with the United States that is subordinate, to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Although the alliance relationship between these two imperialisms is full of contradictions, and these contradictions will develop in the future, they are currently of the same kind and share the same aspirations. The United States, as the leader, is the most aggressive imperialism, and the Japanese traitorous monopoly capital group, as the subordinate, is trying to revive Japanese militarism and make Japanese imperialism rise again. They are against China and the Soviet Union, but their reactionary policies first of all oppress and plunder the Japanese people, and at the same time, they carry out aggression and expansion activities mainly targeting the nationalist countries in Asia that have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression. Today's US-Japan alliance is clearly different from the fascist alliance between Japan and Germany during World War II. Both alliances are extremely reactionary, but today's US-Japan alliance, from the Japanese side, is characterized by Japan's subordination to the United States.
    US imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces, are attempting to quickly revise the US-Japan Security Treaty as a step to strengthen this reactionary alliance. In order to deceive the people and cover up their ulterior motives, the Japanese reactionary forces insist that revising the US-Japan Security Treaty is to achieve equal status in Japan's relations with the United States, and to jointly defend against the so-called communist threat from the Soviet Union and China. Everyone knows that there is no such thing as "equality" between the United States as the controller and the Kishi Nobusuke clique as the subordinate. The "equality" shouted by the Kishi Nobusuke clique is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up their reactionary policies of selling out the national interests of Japan and their imperialist ambitions. As for the so-called "communist threat," the Kishi Nobusuke clique themselves also know that in modern history, it has always been Japan that has invaded the Soviet Union and China, and not the Soviet Union and China that have invaded Japan. For the Soviet Union and China, Japanese imperialism is the culprit that owes debts of aggression. The Soviet Union and China, as socialist countries, will never allow others to invade themselves, and it is impossible to invade others. The Soviet Union and China have established socialist systems and eliminated all systems of exploitation, thus eliminating the social basis for foreign aggression. Communism is fundamentally incompatible with aggression. The Soviet Union and China have never held grudges against Japan, and although their social systems are different, they are willing to coexist peacefully with Japan and are prepared to sign mutual non-aggression treaties separately with Japan or jointly sign a peace treaty on the basis of normal relations. This policy of the Soviet Union and China towards Japan, which aims to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, is obvious to all. The so-called communist threat has always been a smokescreen for imperialism to carry out aggression. This kind of smokescreen is not new. When Japan and Germany and Italy formed an alliance and launched a fascist war of aggression, they used this kind of smokescreen, and it had already been exposed. Today, it is of course even more difficult for the Japanese reactionary forces to confuse people by rehashing old tunes. Since October of last year, the Japanese people have launched a magnificent struggle against revising the US-Japan Security Treaty, demanding the abolition of the US-Japan Security Treaty, and stopping the revival of Japanese militarism. This proves that the Japanese people clearly know that if the conspiracy of the US-Japan reactionaries succeeds and Japanese imperialism is revived, the Japanese people will once again be used as cannon fodder, bringing unprecedented and profound disasters to the Japanese nation.
    As the joint statement pointed out, the Japanese Communist Party has always advocated that the road the Japanese people should take is the road of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality. That is, to achieve complete independence for the Japanese nation externally, abolish military alliances concluded with foreign countries, remove US troops and their bases in Japan, and recover Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands from the United States; internally, it is to guarantee the people's democratic freedom and improve the people's lives. And opposing the US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty, and then abolishing this treaty, is the current urgent task of the Japanese people's struggle. It is obvious that building a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan is an insurmountable historical stage in the Japanese people's revolutionary cause. In this historical stage, the Japanese proletariat and its vanguard, holding high the banner of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, are uniting all patriotic and democratic forces to form a broad united front led by the working class, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and are engaged in a serious struggle against US imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces. It is by no means easy to accomplish the tasks of this historical stage, and it requires a long and serious revolutionary struggle. If it is considered that this historical stage can be surpassed, and that the current historical task of the Japanese people is not to get rid of US control, achieve the complete independence of the Japanese nation, and build a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan, then the Japanese proletariat and its vanguard will be divorced from reality and from the masses, and will be isolated in the face of powerful enemies. This approach is welcomed by the US-Japan reactionaries. Marxists-Leninists are stage theorists of revolutionary development, and at the same time, they are theorists of continuous revolution. They must see both the differences between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and the connection between the two revolutions. The revolutionary line taken by the Japanese Communist Party is the specific embodiment of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete combination of Japanese revolutionary practice. The Chinese Communist Party fully supports the just propositions of the Japanese Communist Party and expresses its infinite respect for the heroic struggle waged by the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people. As the joint statement said, the Japanese Communist Party's struggle to build a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan proves that it is the most resolute defender of the interests of the Japanese nation and the Japanese people.
    The Chinese people have suffered long-term aggression from Japanese imperialism and US imperialism. US imperialism is now the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. Like the Japanese people, the Chinese people cannot tolerate the collusion between US and Japanese imperialist elements, and the Japanese militarists' attempt to rely on the US-Japan alliance to revive Japanese imperialism. It has been fourteen years since Japan's war of aggression against China ended, but China and Japan have not yet restored normal relations, the state of war has not been declared over, and no treaty has been concluded between the two countries. This abnormal relationship is entirely the result of the hostile China policy adopted by US imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, it has consistently adopted a friendly attitude towards the Japanese people, is willing to establish normal relations with Japan in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is working with the Japanese people to promote the development of Sino-Japanese relations in the direction of ending the state of war, restoring diplomatic relations, concluding a treaty and non-aggression treaty. In this regard, the Chinese people and the Chinese government have made all possible efforts. However, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government has consistently, and increasingly, adopted a reactionary policy of hostility towards China, participating in the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and obstructing the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Kishi Nobusuke's wishful thinking is: on the one hand, to be hostile to China, vainly attempting to act as the US's vanguard of aggression in the Far East one day; on the other hand, to do business with China, obtaining economic benefits from China to strengthen its reactionary rule. Kishi Nobusuke attempts to make this reactionary policy towards China a part of his overall policy of reviving Japanese militarism and making Japanese imperialism rise again. As long as the Japanese reactionary forces stubbornly adhere to this policy, normal relations between China and Japan cannot be established, which is contrary to the common wishes of the Chinese and Japanese people. Only when the Japanese government abandons and changes its policy of hostility towards China, does not participate in the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and does not obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, can normal trade relations and cultural exchanges between China and Japan be smoothly developed, and the historical friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people be further advanced.
    The joint statement of the Chinese and Japanese Communist Parties fully expresses the common wishes of the Chinese and Japanese people, and also fully expresses the sympathy and support between the Chinese and Japanese people. The joint statement reveals an important aspect of the current development of the international situation, that is, the people of Asia and the world are facing a serious threat from the war and aggression policies of US imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces. Opposing the US-Japan military alliance and defending peace in the Far East and the world is the common task of the people of Asia and the world, especially the people of China and Japan. The Japanese people, due to their front-line position, bear a particularly important responsibility for this common struggle. We believe that the conspiracy of Japanese militarist imperialism to rise again under the support of the United States will certainly not succeed. The future of the Japanese people is full of light and hope. The Japanese people will surely embark on the road of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, US imperialism will one day be driven away by the Japanese people, and the policies of the Japanese reactionary forces will one day be completely bankrupt. The Chinese and Japanese people will surely work with the people of the world to create brilliant achievements in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, upholding national independence of all countries, and promoting the cause of human progress.

### 反对美日军事同盟和保卫远东和平是中日两国人民的共同任务

    反对美日军事同盟和保卫远东和平是中日两国人民的共同任务
    在日本共产党代表团访问中国期间，中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志会见了以日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三同志为首的日本共产党代表团，进行了热烈的、亲切的谈话。中国共产党代表团和日本共产党代表团还举行了会谈，并且在10月20日，由中国共产党代表团团长刘少奇同志和日本共产党代表团团长野坂参三同志代表两党中央，签署了具有重大历史意义的联合声明。中日两国共产党之间的会谈，正如联合声明所说，有助于增强中日两国共产党之间的团结，有助于发展中日两国人民之间的传统友谊。中日两国人民携起手来，共同反对美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力的战争政策和侵略政策，对于保卫世界和平、特别是保卫远东和平具有十分重要的作用。
    全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义，抱着称霸远东、奴役日本人民和亚洲人民的目的，从第二次世界大战结束以来，就积极地控制日本，扶植日本军国主义，把日本变成美国的军事基地，从而严重地损害了日本人民争取和平、独立、民主、中立的事业，同时，对于远东和世界的和平造成了严重的威胁。最近，美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力更进一步地互相勾结，狼狈为奸，正在力谋修改日美安全保障条约，加强两国公开的军事同盟，同日本人民和亚洲人民为敌。日本反动势力在美国指使下，还正在加紧剥夺日本人民的民主权利，准备修改宪法，积极进行包括核武器在内的重新武装，打着以“美国资本和日本技术合作来开发东南亚资源”的旗号，大肆进行经济和政治的扩张活动。这种情况，对于日本人民是一个灾祸，对于亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民是一个新的严重威胁，必须引起人们高度的警惕。
    日本曾经是一个军国主义的帝国主义国家。在第二次大战以后，作为帝国主义基础的日本垄断资本，其主要部分在新的条件下有了发展，并形成为同美国垄断资本密切结合并受美国垄断资本控制的日本卖国垄断资本集团。在美国资本扶植下，这个垄断集团的资本和生产已比战前更加集中，它对日本各重要产业的控制也比战前更为加强。日本帝国主义虽然因为战败而丧失了殖民地，但是最近几年，日本的经济获得了比较迅速的恢复和发展。到今年8月，日本的工矿业生产已达到战前水平的二点七倍，超过第二次大战时期最高水平（1944年）一点一倍；但是日本的出口贸易，到目前为止，仅仅恢复到战前水平。日本的生产和市场的矛盾正在日益扩大。在这种情况下，日本垄断资本正在借助美国的卵翼，用各种方式加强自己的资本输出，以建立和扩大自己争夺原料产地和销售市场的斗争阵地。日本财政寡头的统治，通过垄断组织和国家政权的融合，也比过去任何时候更为直接和露骨。岸信介本人及其政府，就是日本卖国垄断资本集团的代表。这一切证明，在美国的一手扶植下，日本反动势力正在企图使日本再次成为一个军国主义的帝国主义国家。
    岸信介政府执行的对外对内的反动政策，是在既依附美国、又同美国结成同盟的情况下出现的。对美国帝国主义说来，受美国控制的军国主义的日本，是美国侵略亚洲的主要帮凶和最大的军事基地。日本的这一作用，在美国侵略朝鲜的战争中已经得到了充分的证明。1952年4月美制的片面的旧金山和约生效以后，美国占领机构撤出了日本，但是，通过同旧金山和约同时签订的日美安全保障条约和其他一系列协定，美国依旧在政治上和军事上保持着对日本的半占领地位。美国的军队依旧驻在日本，美国的军事基地分布在日本全国，日本的领土冲绳和小笠原群岛依旧被控制在美国手里。美国通过对日本的贷款、军事订货、贸易和美国私人资本在日本的活动，在经济上也对日本保持着控制。随着美国的控制而输入日本的美帝国主义的黄色文化和生活方式，也在腐蚀着日本人民。这一切必然形成日本在美日同盟中对美国的从属性。另一方面，日本虽然是一个战败国，但它不是一个经济落后的国家，而是一个经济发达的资本主义国家。美帝国主义为了在亚洲进行侵略，有必要利用日本的工业能力和军事潜力，使日本为美国火中取栗，驱使日本和美国结成从属的同盟关系。而在日本方面，日本反动势力也妄想利用美国的力量，依靠同美国的具有从属性的同盟关系，来重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。尽管这两个帝国主义的同盟关系是充满着矛盾的，这种矛盾将来还会有所发展，但是，它们在目前却是物以类聚，志同道合，作为盟主的美国是最富侵略性的帝国主义，作为从属者的日本卖国垄断资本集团又正在企图通过复活日本军国主义而使日本帝国主义重新抬头。它们是反对中国和苏联的，但是它们的反动政策，首先是压迫和掠夺日本人民，同时以曾经遭受过日本帝国主义侵略的亚洲的民族主义国家为主要对象而进行侵略和扩张的活动。今天的美日同盟显然不同于第二次大战时期日本和德国之间的法西斯同盟。两种同盟都具有极端的反动性，但是今天的美日同盟，就日本方面说来，它是以日本从属于美国为特征的。
    美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力正在企图迅速修改日美安全保障条约，作为加强这一反动同盟的步骤。日本反动势力为了欺骗人民，掩盖自己不可告人的目的，硬说修改日美安全保障条约是为了在日本同美国的关系中取得平等地位，为了共同防御所谓来自苏联和中国的共产主义威胁。大家知道，作为控制者的美国和从属者的岸信介之流中间根本谈不上什么“平等”。岸信介之流所叫嚷的“平等”，不过是掩盖他们自己出卖日本民族利益的反动政策和帝国主义野心的烟幕。至于说到什么“共产主义的威胁”，那么，岸信介之流自己也知道，在近代历史上，从来就是日本侵略苏联和中国，而不是苏联和中国侵略日本。对苏联和中国来说，日本帝国主义是欠了侵略血债的罪魁祸首。苏联和中国，作为社会主义国家，决不允许别人侵略自己，也决不可能侵略别人。苏联和中国都建立了社会主义制度，消灭了一切剥削制度，也就消灭了对外侵略的社会基础。共产主义同侵略是根本不相容的。苏联和中国对待日本从来不究既往，虽然彼此的社会制度不同，但是愿意同日本和平共处，并且准备在正常关系的基础上同日本分别签订互不侵犯条约或者共同签订和平公约。苏联和中国对待日本的这种以保卫远东和世界和平为宗旨的政策，是有目共睹的。所谓共产主义的威胁，从来就是帝国主义进行侵略的烟幕。这种烟幕并不新鲜。当年日本和德国、意大利结成同盟，发动法西斯侵略战争的时候，就使用过这种烟幕，并且早已被揭穿了。今天日本反动势力旧调新弹，当然是更难迷惑人了。日本人民从去年10月起，展开了反对修改日美安全条约、要求废止日美安全条约和制止复活日本军国主义的波澜壮阔的斗争。这就证明，日本人民清楚地知道，如果让美日反动派的阴谋得逞，让日本帝国主义复活，日本人民就将再一次充当炮灰，给日本民族带来空前深重的灾难。
    正如联合声明所指出，日本共产党一贯主张，日本人民应该走的道路，是和平、独立、民主、中立的道路。这就是对外取得日本民族的完全独立，废除同外国缔结的军事同盟，撤除在日本的美国军队及其基地，从美国手中收回冲绳和小笠原群岛；对内则是保障人民的民主自由，改善人民生活。而反对美帝国主义和岸信介政府修改日美安全保障条约，并进而废除这一条约，则是日本人民当前迫切的斗争任务。显而易见，建立一个和平、独立、民主、中立的日本，是日本人民革命事业的一个不可超越的历史阶段。在这个历史阶段上，日本无产阶级及其先锋队高举着和平、独立、民主和中立的旗帜，正在把一切爱国民主的力量团结起来，结成以工人阶级为首的包括共产党和社会党在内的广泛统一战线，同美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力进行严重的斗争。实现这个历史阶段的任务，决不是轻而易举的，而是需要经过长期的严重的革命斗争。如果认为这个历史阶段可以超越，日本人民当前历史阶段的任务不是摆脱美国的控制，实现日本民族的完全独立，建立一个和平、独立、民主、中立的日本，那末，就会使日本无产阶级及其先锋队脱离实际、脱离群众，使自己在强大的敌人面前陷于孤立地位。这种做法，是美日反动派所欢迎的。马克思列宁主义者，是革命发展的阶段论者，同时又是不断革命论者，既要看到民主主义革命和社会主义革命的区别，又要看到这两个革命之间的联系。现在日本共产党所采取的上述的革命路线，正是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和日本革命实践相结合的具体表现。中国共产党对于日本共产党的正义主张表示完全支持，对于日本共产党和日本人民所进行的英勇斗争表示无限的敬意。正如联合声明所说，日本共产党为建立一个和平、独立、民主、中立的日本而进行的斗争，证明它是日本民族和日本人民的利益的最坚决的保卫者。
    中国人民曾经遭受过日本帝国主义和美国帝国主义的长期侵略。美帝国主义现在是中国人民和日本人民的共同敌人。中国人民和日本人民一样，对于美日帝国主义分子的互相勾结，对于日本军国主义者妄想依靠美日同盟而使日本帝国主义重新抬头，是决不能容忍的。自从日本对中国的侵略战争结束以来，已经有十四年了，但是中日两国尚未恢复正常关系，战争状态尚未宣告结束，两国之间尚未缔结和约。这种不正常的关系，完全是美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力所采取的敌视中国政策的结果。中华人民共和国自从建立以来，对日本人民一贯采取友好的态度，愿意根据和平共处五项原则同日本建立正常关系，并且同日本人民一起努力推动中日关系向着结束战争状态、恢复邦交、缔结和约和互不侵犯条约的方向发展。在这方面，中国人民和中国政府作了一切可能的努力。但是日本岸信介政府却一贯地、越来越变本加厉地采取敌视中国、参加美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋、阻挠中日关系正常化的反动政策。岸信介的如意算盘是：一方面敌视中国，妄想有朝一日充当美国在远东的侵略先锋；另一方面又要和中国做买卖，从中国取得经济实惠来加强它的反动统治。岸信介企图把它对中国的这种反动政策作为它的复活日本军国主义、使日本帝国主义重新抬头的总政策的一个组成部分。只要日本反动势力固执这种政策，中日两国之间的正常关系就不可能建立，这是违背中国人民和日本人民的共同愿望的。只有日本政府放弃和改变敌视中国的政策，不参加美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，不阻挠中日关系的正常化，中日两国之间的正常贸易关系和文化来往才能得到顺利的发展，中日两国人民之间的具有历史传统的友谊也才能得到进一步的进展。
    中日两国共产党的联合声明，充分表达了中日两国人民的共同愿望，也充分表示了中日两国人民相互之间的同情和支持。联合声明揭示出当前国际形势发展中的一个重要方面，即亚洲和全世界人民面临着美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力的战争政策和侵略政策的严重威胁。反对美日军事同盟，保卫远东和世界和平，是亚洲人民和全世界人民，首先是中日两国人民的共同任务。日本人民由于所处的首当其冲的地位，对于这个共同斗争肩负着特别重大的责任。我们相信，日本军国主义的帝国主义在美国扶植下重新抬头的阴谋是一定不能得逞的。日本人民的前途是充满着光明和希望的。日本人民一定能够走上和平、独立、民主、中立的道路，美帝国主义总有一天要被日本人民赶走，日本反动势力的政策总有一天要遭到完全的破产。中日两国人民必将同世界人民一起，为保卫远东和世界和平、维护各国民族独立和推进人类进步的事业创造出辉煌的成果。
