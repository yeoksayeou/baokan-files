Huanggang and Other Areas Exceed Fish Catching Plans
    Hubei Provincial People's Committee Commends

    (Our newspaper reports) The Hubei Provincial People's Committee issued a commendation order on October 5, commending Huanggang Special District and fourteen counties including Hanyang, Hanchuan, Xinzhou, Xishui, Jiangling, Huanggang, Guangji, Yangxin, Yingcheng, Xiaogan, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Yunmeng, and Huangpi in Hubei for achieving remarkable results in fishery production. The commendation order stated that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, Hubei Province's fishery production has achieved new results this year on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. The output of adult fish has increased significantly, and many areas have exceeded their third-quarter production plans. Among them, Huanggang Special District and fourteen counties including Hanyang, Hanchuan, Xinzhou, Xishui, Jiangling, Huanggang, Guangji, Yangxin, Yingcheng, Xiaogan, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Yunmeng, and Huangpi have achieved the most outstanding results. They have not only exceeded their third-quarter production plans, but also exceeded their third-quarter purchasing and transfer targets, powerfully supporting national construction and ensuring market supply. Therefore, a commendation is hereby issued.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan - Hubei Province, famous for its freshwater fish production, is seeing vast numbers of fishermen actively catching adult fish. By the end of September, the labor force participating in fishing had increased from the original 20,000 to more than 74,000, and the number of fishing boats had increased from less than 10,000 to more than 38,000. A total of 144 million jin of adult fish were caught in the third quarter, more than the total output of the first and second quarters combined. The output in September alone was close to the total output of July and August.

    This year's large-scale harvesting of adult fish in Hubei started more than two months earlier than last year, breaking the past habit of "repairing boats and nets in summer and autumn, and fighting on the lake in spring and winter." Since June, all localities have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the "three returns" of fishermen's boats and tools. The Party secretaries at all levels in major producing areas such as Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou personally took command, leading the fishermen to quickly engage in production, which caused fresh fish production to rise sharply. After strengthening its leadership, Xishui County exceeded its annual target by mid-September. After the fishing labor force increased in Xinzhou County, 1.08 million jin of fish were caught in twenty days in September, a two-fold increase compared with the same period last year. In the process of organizing the harvest, various localities adopted the method of "returning to the team, repairing boats, and producing at the same time," which solved the difficulty of insufficient fishing gear and met the needs of production. Jiangling County organized more than 420 carpenters to repair 2,100 fishing boats in fifteen days, and also newly installed six large nets. By the middle of September, the county had caught 9.5 million jin of adult fish, an increase of 75% compared with the same period last year, and completed the annual fresh fish transfer task three months ahead of schedule.

    In the harvesting process, all localities attached great importance to mobilizing the masses, making a big splash in technological revolution, carrying out versatile movements for multiple operations, and promoting various advanced harvesting methods according to local conditions. Jiangling County adopted the method of fishing with large frame nets, which enabled twenty-four people to catch 100,000 jin a day, increasing production efficiency by more than tenfold.

　　黄冈等地超额完成捕鱼计划
    湖北省人民委员会嘉奖
    本报讯　湖北省人民委员会10月5日发布嘉奖令，嘉奖湖北黄冈专区和汉阳、汉川、新洲、浠水、江陵、黄冈、广济、阳新、应城、孝感、潜江、天门、云梦、黄陂等十四个县在渔业生产上获得显著成绩。嘉奖令说，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，今年湖北省渔业生产在去年大跃进的基础上，又获得了新的成绩，成鱼产量显著上升，很多地区已超额完成第三季度生产计划。其中尤以黄冈专区和汉阳、汉川、新洲、浠水、江陵、黄冈、广济、阳新、应城、孝感、潜江、天门、云梦、黄陂等十四个县成绩最为卓著，他们不仅超额完成了第三季度的生产计划，而且超额完成了第三季度收购和上调任务，有力地支援了国家建设，保证了市场的供应。为此，特通令嘉奖。
    据新华社武汉讯　以产淡水鱼驰名的湖北省，广大渔民正在积极捞捕成鱼。到9月底，参加捞捕的劳动力由原来的二万人增加到七万四千多人，渔船由不足一万只增加到三万八千多只；第三季度共捕成鱼一亿四千四百万斤，比第一、二季度总产量还多；9月份产量接近7、8两月产量的总和。
    湖北今年的大搞成鱼捞捕，比去年要提早两个多月，打破了过去“夏秋两季修船网，春冬两季战湖心”的习惯。6月以来，各地就认真地贯彻了中共湖北省委关于渔民船只、工具“三归队”的精神，黄冈、孝感、荆州等主要产区各级党委书记亲自挂帅，领导渔民迅速投入生产，使鲜鱼产量直线上升。浠水县在加强领导后，9月中旬就超额完成了全年的任务。新洲县捕鱼劳力增加后，9月份二十天就捕了一百零八万斤鱼，比去年同期增加了两倍。在组织捞捕的过程中，各地采取了“边归队、边修补船只，边生产”的办法，解决了渔具不足的困难，满足了生产需要。江陵县组织四百二十多个木匠，十五天修好二千一百只渔船，还新置了六部大网，全县到9月半止已捞捕成鱼九百五十万斤，比去年同期增加75％，提前三个月完成了全年鲜鱼上调任务。
    在捞捕中，各地十分重视发动群众，大闹技术革命，开展了多种作业的多面手运动，因地制宜地推广了各种先进的捞捕方法。江陵县采用大型架网捕鱼的办法，二十四人一天可捕十万斤，生产效率提高十倍以上。
