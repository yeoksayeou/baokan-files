Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th—Our correspondent reports: The forty-second anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution is approaching, and the Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country, is singing the triumph of communist construction and is about to step into a new year. In past years, it has left a deep impression on people with the rich fruits of national economic construction, and its current rapid pace of progress demonstrates limitless and beautiful prospects.

Constantly Achieving New Victories in the Race to Catch Up with the United States

    The Soviet national economic construction presents a scene of vigorous development and soaring wings. It now produces one-fifth of the world's industrial products, and its agriculture is thriving. In 1913, before the October Revolution, Tsarist Russia's pig iron, steel, oil, and electricity, the most important industrial products, accounted for only 13.3%, 13.2%, 27.4%, and 7.7% of the United States' production, respectively. In 1958, the Soviet Union's output of these products accounted for 75.6%, 71%, 34.6%, and 32.6% of the United States' production, respectively. In 1913, Russia's coal production accounted for only 5.6% of the United States' production, but by last year, the Soviet Union had exceeded the United States' level by 32%. Before this year, the Soviet Union had already surpassed the United States in the output of industrial products such as combine harvesters, peat, woolen fabrics, sugar, timber felling, and reinforced concrete components, as well as important agricultural products such as wheat, sugar beets, flax, milk, animal fats, and wool. Since the beginning of this year, in the race to catch up with the United States, the Soviet Union has surpassed the current level of the United States in the production of iron ore and internal combustion locomotives. In the first nine months of this year, the Soviet Union's iron ore production exceeded the United States' total annual production last year by 1.5 million tons.

Establishing a Powerful Industrial Agriculture in an Extremely Short Historical Period

    The Soviet Union has established a powerful industry and highly developed agriculture in an extremely short historical period. Compared with 1913, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value in 1958 increased by 35 times. In the forty-one years from 1918 to 1958, Soviet industry developed at an average annual rate of 10.1%, which is more than twice as fast as the United States during the same period. In this way, the Soviet Union completed the road that developed capitalist countries took hundreds or even hundreds of years to complete in a few decades. The Soviet Union has far surpassed all capitalist countries in Europe in terms of industrial production level and is now rapidly catching up with the United States. The Soviet Union's agricultural production has also made great progress, increasing the total output value by more than double in the forty years after the revolution. This year, the Soviet national economy has achieved a new leap forward. It is estimated that industrial production will increase by about 12%, while the United States' industrial production index is currently stagnating at the level of December 1956 to February 1957.
    
    The Soviet Union has entered a period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction. The Seven-Year Plan, which began this year, is a decisive stage in this period. During these seven years, the scale of the Soviet national economic construction and the scale of production growth are almost equivalent to the past few decades of the Soviet Union, and in some aspects even exceed the past few decades. This is unique in world history. If the Soviet Union's investment in basic construction for the national economy during these seven years is converted into U.S. dollars, these investments are equivalent to more than 80% of the total national property of the United States in 1949. During these seven years, the total capacity of steelmaking equipment built and put into production in the Soviet Union will reach 28 million to 36 million tons, which is equivalent to the existing steelmaking equipment capacity of West Germany (including Saar) in 1957, greatly exceeding the total production capacity of the existing steelmaking equipment in the United Kingdom.

Building a Communist Mansion, the Seven-Year Plan is Magnificent and Unparalleled

    The situation of Soviet economic development has been unprecedentedly good since the beginning of this year. In the first three quarters of this year, the growth rate of Soviet industry exceeded the average rate achieved in the past seven years, which is about 42% to 50% faster than the targets set in the Seven-Year Plan and this year's plan. The harvest of various important agricultural products this year will exceed the unprecedentedly abundant harvest of last year. This development speed exceeded the estimates of the most daring optimists at the beginning of the year, and also shattered a fallacy of many Western economists, who said that during the Seven-Year Plan, with the expansion of the scale of production, the Soviet Union's production development speed would be "decreasing". Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in a recent speech that the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union during the Seven-Year Plan will no longer increase by about 80% as originally stipulated, but will increase by one time. This shows that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan will be completed greatly ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

Continue to Give Priority to the Development of Heavy Industry while Vigorously Developing Agriculture

    After more than forty years of construction, the Soviet Union is now in a period in which it is entirely possible to vigorously develop the consumer goods industry, agriculture, and transportation while continuing to give priority to the development of heavy industry, and to vigorously build housing and various social and cultural facilities in order to develop all sectors of the national economy more harmoniously and eliminate the backwardness of certain links in the national economy. The distribution of Soviet basic construction investment during the Seven-Year Plan and the changes in the comparison of industrial and agricultural development speeds clearly show this development trend. For example, compared with the past seven years, during the period from 1959 to 1965, the Soviet Union's investment in basic construction for production projects will increase by 83% to 86%; investment in basic construction for housing and public utility projects will increase by 75% to 77%; and investment in basic construction for cultural, educational, health, and sports undertakings will increase by more than 74%. That is to say, the increase rate of investment in production projects (such as industry, agriculture, etc.) is almost as much as the increase rate of investment in non-production projects. The increase rate of investment in agriculture, transportation, and postal and telecommunications departments is also the same as that of industry, and will almost double. In industry, investment in the consumer goods industry will also double. Taking the development speed of industry and agriculture as an example, during the period from 1950 to 1953, Soviet industrial production increased by an average of more than 15% per year, and agricultural production was 1.6%; during the period from 1954 to 1957, industrial production increased by an average of 11.5% per year, and agriculture was 7.1%. During the Seven-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate of industry and agriculture will be 8.6% and 8%, respectively. In Soviet history, the development speed of industry and agriculture has never been so close.

    Due to the more coordinated development of the national economy during the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will greatly accelerate the establishment of the material basis of communism, thereby helping to surpass the United States in terms of economic level and people's living standards more quickly. According to the most conservative estimate, by 1965, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value will exceed the sum of the total industrial output value of the entire capitalist world in 1937, and in the subsequent three to five years, it will overwhelm the United States in terms of total industrial and agricultural output and output per capita.

    苏联共产主义建设凯歌响彻云霄
    国民经济快速前进的步伐展示了无限美好前景
    新华社莫斯科30日电　本社记者报道：十月社会主义革命四十二周年就要来临了，世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联高唱共产主义建设的凯歌，即将跨入新的年头。在以往的年代里，它以国民经济建设的丰硕果实给人留下了深刻的印象，它目前的快速前进的步伐更展示了无限美好的前景。在追赶美国竞赛中不断取得新的胜利
    苏联国民经济建设呈现出一片蓬勃发展、展翼高飞的景象。它现在生产着全世界五分之一的工业产品，她的农业蒸蒸日上。在十月革命前的1913年，沙皇俄国的生铁、钢、石油、电力、这几种最重要的工业产品，只分别占美国的13.3％、13.2％、27.4％、7.7％。而在1958年，苏联的这几种产品的产量已分别占美国的75.6％、71％、34.6％、32.6％。1913年，俄国的煤产量只占美国的5.6％，而到去年，苏联已经超过美国水平32％。在今年以前，苏联早就在联合机、泥炭、毛织品、糖、木材采伐量、钢筋混凝土构件等工业品的产量，以及小麦、甜菜、亚麻、牛奶、动物油脂、羊毛等重要农产品的产量上超过了美国。今年以来，在追赶美国的竞赛中，苏联又在铁矿砂和内燃机车产量上超过了美国目前的水平。在今年头九个月内，苏联的铁矿砂产量比美国去年全年的产量还多一百五十万吨。在极短的历史时期建立强大工业农业
    苏联在极短的历史时期内已经建立了强大的工业和高度发展的农业。同1913年比较，1958年苏联的工业总产值增加了三十五倍。在1918到1958年的四十一年间，苏联工业以每年平均10.1％的速度发展着，这比美国在同一时期的速度快二倍以上。这样，苏联用几十年的时间就走完了发达的资本主义国家用了成百年甚至几百年的时间才走完的道路。苏联在工业生产水平上已经远远地超过欧洲一切资本主义国家，现在正在迅速地追上美国。苏联的农业生产也取得了巨大的发展，在革命后的四十年间就把总产值增加了一倍以上。今年，苏联的国民经济又取得了新的跃进。预计，工业生产将增加12％左右，而美国的工业生产指数目前却在1956年12月至1957年2月的水平上停滞不前。
    苏联已经进入了全面展开共产主义建设的时期。从今年开始的七年计划，正是这一时期的决定性阶段。在这七年间，苏联国民经济建设的规模和生产增长的规模差不多和苏联过去几十年相当，在某些方面甚至超过了过去几十年。这在世界历史上是绝无仅有的。如果把这七年间苏联用于国民经济的基本建设投资折算成美元，这些投资等于1949年美国全部国家财产的80％以上。在这七年间，苏联建成和投入生产的炼钢设备能力总共将达二千八百万至三千六百万吨，这等于1957年西德（包括萨尔）的现有炼钢设备能力，大大超过英国现有的炼钢设备的全部生产能力。兴建共产主义大厦七年计划雄伟无比
    今年以来苏联经济发展的形势空前良好。在今年头三个季度内，苏联工业的增长速度就超过了已往七年所达到的平均速度，比七年计划和今年计划规定的指标快42％至50％左右。今年各种重要农产品的收成将超过空前丰收的去年。这样的发展速度出乎最大胆的乐观主义者在年初的估计，也粉碎了西方许多经济学家的一种谬论，他们说什么在七年计划期间，随着生产规模的扩大，苏联生产发展速度将有所“递减”。赫鲁晓夫同志最近在一次讲话中指出，在七年计划期间苏联工业总产值将不再像原来规定的那样增加约80％，而是要增加一倍。这说明苏联七年计划将大大提前和超额完成。继续优先发展重工业同时也大力发展农业
    经过以往四十多年的建设，苏联现在已经处于这样一个时期，在这个时期内，它完全有可能在继续优先发展重工业的同时，大力发展消费品工业、农业和运输业，并大力建设住宅和各种社会与文化设施，以便更协调地发展国民经济各部门，消除国民经济中某些环节的落后状况。七年计划期间，苏联基本建设投资的分布情况和工农业发展速度的对比的变化，特别清楚地表明了这一发展趋势。例如，与过去七年比较，在1959至1965年期间，苏联用于生产项目的基本建设投资将增加83％至86％；用于住宅和公用事业项目的基本建设投资将增加75％至77％；用于文教保健事业的基本建设投资将增加74％以上。这就是说，用于生产项目（如工业、农业等）的投资的增加率和用于非生产项目的投资的增加率差不多一样多。用于农业、运输和邮电部门的投资的增加率也跟工业一样，差不多都将增加一倍。工业中，用于消费品工业的投资也将增加一倍。再以工业和农业的发展速度为例，在1950至1953年期间，苏联工业生产每年平均增加15％强，农业生产为1.6％；1954—1957年期间工业年平均增长11.5％，农业为7.1％。而在七年计划期间，工农业每年平均增长率分别为8.6％与8％。在苏联历史上，工农业发展速度从来还没有如此接近过。
    由于七年计划期间国民经济的更加协调的发展，苏联将大大加速共产主义物质基础的建立，从而有助于更快地从经济水平和人民生活水平上超过美国。根据最保守的估计，到1965年，苏联的工业总产值就将超过1937年整个资本主义世界工业产值的总和，并在随后的三、五年内，在工农业总产量和按人口计算的产量方面压倒美国。
