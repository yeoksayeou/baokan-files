Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch. TASS, Moscow, 8th dispatch: Soviet "Pravda" correspondent in New York, Borovsky, wrote: The sole purpose of raising the Tibet issue in the United Nations is to poison the atmosphere and instigate the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

The author pointed out that the current session is being held in favorable circumstances. Khrushchev's visit to the United States and the Camp David talks have created a new atmosphere in international relations, which is an important step towards eliminating the hateful "Cold War."

However, unfortunately, there are still some people in the West who go against reason and are unwilling to see a turning point in international relations. They still stubbornly cling to the bankrupt "Cold War" policy, attempting to obstruct the normalization of the international climate. This group of people has gone to great lengths to undermine the beneficial work of the 14th United Nations General Assembly.

The defenders of the "Cold War" are trying to force the United Nations General Assembly to discuss an unreasonable slander, namely their so-called "Tibetan issue." This is a typical example of the tactics they have adopted in the United Nations.

The sole purpose of creating this fabricated issue is to poison the atmosphere, instigate the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, and divert the attention of the delegates from the most important international issues that should be discussed.

The defenders of the "Cold War" are unwilling to consider the opinions of the majority of the delegations. They are directly exerting pressure on many representatives, and are once again using "coercive methods." However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so.

Borovsky wrote: It would be beneficial for some defenders of the "Cold War" to remember that the era in which they used the United Nations as a tool of their foreign policy is over. Whether they like it or not, they must take this into account.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th dispatch. "Izvestia" today published an observer's article entitled "Sabotage Activities of Cold War Supporters in the United Nations," criticizing the provocative behavior of the "Cold War" instigators who are attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs by raising the so-called "Tibetan issue" in the United Nations General Assembly.

The article said that the UN Secretariat received a letter from representatives of Ireland and Malaya. This letter, planned by the U.S. delegation, suggested including the "Tibetan issue" on the agenda of the current session. The UN General Assembly is again attempting to bring up issues that are fundamentally not within the purview of the United Nations for discussion. This shameful proposal by Ireland and Malaya is contrary to the general spirit and principles of the UN Charter. The situation in Tibet has nothing to do with the United Nations, because this issue has been and still is purely China's internal affair. Similarly, the issues of "the right to freedom of Tibetans" and the so-called "infringement on the traditional way of life of Tibetans" are all fabrications.

The article said that U.S. Secretary of State Herter, in his speech at the UN General Assembly, even tried to impress the audience with "human rights" and the "Tibetan nation." This cry for the fate of the Tibetan people is completely hypocritical.

The article said that the imperialist group's propaganda is trying to alienate relations between China and Asian countries, and to poison the relations between India and other Asian countries and People's China. Colonialists are trying to persuade independent Asian countries to abandon the neutral path they have chosen and drag them into military blocs, openly interfering in their internal affairs, as is currently the case with interference in Laos through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The article finally emphasized that Tibet has been and will continue to be an indivisible part of China. Therefore, the issue of Tibet is the internal affair of the great Chinese people and does not fall within the purview of the United Nations. The attempt to forcibly bring the "Tibetan issue" to the UN General Assembly shows that some people are still trying to sharpen the political situation.

    苏联“真理报”和“消息报”发表文章指出
    冷战的支持者在联合国恶毒挑衅  妄图干涉中国内政阻挠局势缓和
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联“真理报”驻纽约特派记者鲍罗夫斯基写道：在联合国中提出西藏问题的唯一目的是毒化气氛，唆使联合国干涉中华人民共和国的内政。
    作者指出本届会议是在有利的情况下举行的。赫鲁晓夫访美、戴维营的会谈在国际关系中创造了一种新的气氛，这是消除仇视人民的“冷战”的重要步骤。
    但是，遗憾的是，在西方还有这样一帮人，他们违反理智，不愿意看到国际关系中出现转折点。他们仍旧死死抱住破了产的“冷战”政策不放，企图阻挠国际气候的正常化。这帮人费尽九牛二虎之力来破坏第十四届联合国大会的有益的工作。
    “冷战”的捍卫者力图迫使联合国大会会议讨论一个无理诽谤，即他们所谓的“西藏问题”，这是他们在联合国所采取的手腕的典型例子。
    制造这种无中生有的问题的唯一的目的是想毒化气氛，唆使联合国来干涉中华人民共和国的内政，转移代表们对应该讨论的最重要的国际问题的注意力。
      “冷战”的捍卫者不愿意考虑大多数代表团的意见。他们对许多代表直接施加压力，再次使用“强制手法”。可是，这样做越来越困难了。
    鲍罗夫斯基写道：某些“冷战”的捍卫者如果能记住，他们利用联合国作为他们外交政策的工具的时代已经过去了，这对他们是有益的。不管他们愿不愿意，他们必须考虑到这一点。
    新华社莫斯科8日电　“消息报”今天发表观察家一篇题为“冷战支持者在联合国的破坏行为”的文章，抨击“冷战”煽动者企图在联大中提出所谓“西藏问题”来干涉中国内政的挑衅行为。
    文章说，联大秘书处收到了爱尔兰和马来亚代表的一封信，在这封美国代表团所策划的信中建议把“西藏问题”列入本届大会日程，联大又在企图把根本不在联合国职权范围内的问题拿来讨论。爱尔兰和马来亚的这一可耻的建议是违反一般精神和联合国宪章原则的。西藏的情况同联合国没有任何关系，因为这一问题过去和现在都纯粹是中国的内政。同样，关于“西藏人自由权”，关于所谓“侵害西藏人传统生活方式”的问题也都是捏造的。
    文章说，美国国务卿赫脱在联大的发言中竟竭力企图以“人权”和“西藏民族”来打动听众，这种对西藏人命运的哭号，是彻头彻尾的虚伪的。
    文章说，帝国主义集团的宣传力图离间中国和亚洲各国的关系，毒化印度和其他亚洲国家同人民中国的关系。殖民主义者力图促使亚洲独立国家离开它们自己选择的中立道路而把它们拖入军事集团，公开干涉它们的内政，像目前通过东南亚条约组织干涉老挝一样。
    文章最后强调指出，西藏过去和今后都是中国不可分割的一部分。因此，西藏的问题是伟大的中国人民的内政，而不属于联合国的职权范围。把“西藏问题”硬拉到联大中去的企图说明，某些人物还在想使政治形势尖锐化。
