　　Plant More, Plant Fast, Plant Well
    Suburban Beijing Completes Wheat Planting Task
    Sets Record of 130,000 Mu Planted in a Single Day on National Day
    (Our Newspaper) News: The suburbs of Beijing have completed the wheat sowing task before the Cold Dew solar term. As of the 9th, districts and counties in the suburbs have sown 1.5 million mu of wheat, an increase of 180,000 mu compared to the summer harvest area this year.

    "Planting More, Planting Fast, Planting Well" are the characteristics of this year's wheat planting in the suburbs of Beijing. Starting in late September, districts, counties, communes, and production teams launched wheat planting competitions, greatly accelerating the sowing progress. Around National Day, the wheat planting campaign reached its climax, with the daily sowing progress increasing from 70,000-80,000 mu to over 100,000 mu. On National Day, suburban farmers celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with their practical actions, creating a record of planting 130,000 mu in a single day.

    In the wheat sowing campaign, all localities conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Many places also established high-yield wheat fields to strive for large-scale high yields next year. In Han Village Commune, Pinggu County, all 11,500 mu of wheat were deeply ploughed to a depth of over seven inches, with an average of 10,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu. All land that could be irrigated was converted into ridge fields, and the sowing quality was better than any previous year. In the Daciluo Team of Fangshan Commune, Zhoukoudian District, out of 1,450 mu of wheat fields, 500 mu were high-yield fields, with 12,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu. All were selected with improved varieties, ensuring that the land was as flat as a mirror and the ridges as straight as lines. During the sowing period, many places held on-site meetings in a timely manner to strengthen inspection and acceptance to ensure that the sowing quality met the requirements. After completing the wheat sowing plan, many communes in the suburbs of Beijing actively increased wheat planting without affecting other production. For example, in Fengtai and Haidian districts, under the principle of ensuring the expansion of vegetable planting areas, they completed the original wheat planting plan and expanded the planting by nearly 10,000 mu. Mentougou District, which had no wheat planting task, also planted more than 6,000 mu of wheat.

### 种得多　种得快　种得好  首都郊区完成种麦任务  国庆节创日播十三万亩最高纪录

　　种得多　种得快　种得好
    首都郊区完成种麦任务
    国庆节创日播十三万亩最高纪录
    本报讯　首都郊区已在寒露前完成小麦播种任务。截至9日止，郊区各区、县已播种小麦一百五十万亩，比今年夏季收获面积增加十八万亩。
    “种多、种快、种好”是今年首都郊区种麦的特点。从9月下旬开始，各区、县、公社、生产队之间，开展了种麦竞赛运动，使播种进度大大加快。国庆节前后，种麦运动达到最高潮，播种日进度由七、八万亩增到十万亩以上。国庆节这一天，郊区农民用自己的实际行动欢庆建国十周年，创造日播十三万亩的高纪录。
    在播种小麦运动中，各地都认真贯彻执行了“八字宪法”。许多地方还搞了小麦丰产方，争取明年的大面积丰产。平谷县韩庄公社播种的一万一千五百亩小麦，全部深耕七寸以上，平均每亩施底肥一万斤，凡能浇水的地，都实行了畦田化，播种质量比以往任何一年好。周口店区房山公社大次洛队种的一千四百五十亩麦田中，有五百亩丰产田，每亩施肥一万二千斤，全部选用了良种，做到地平如镜，埂直如线。许多地方在播种期间，都及时召开现场会议，加强检查验收，以保证播种质量合乎要求。首都郊区许多公社在完成播麦计划后，在不影响其他生产的原则下，积极增种小麦。如丰台、海淀两个区，在保证扩大蔬菜种植面积的原则下，完成了原订的种麦计划后，又扩种了近万亩小麦。没有种麦任务的门头沟区，也种了六千多亩小麦。
