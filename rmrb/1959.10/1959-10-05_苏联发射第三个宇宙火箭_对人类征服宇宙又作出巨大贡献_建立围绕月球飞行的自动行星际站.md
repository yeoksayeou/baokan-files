Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: TASS announced the publication of a communique on the launch of the third Soviet cosmic rocket on the 4th. The full text of the communique is as follows:

According to the plan for studying cosmic space and preparing for interplanetary flight, the Soviet Union successfully launched its third cosmic rocket on October 4, 1959. An automatic interplanetary station was installed on the rocket.

This launch was conducted using a multi-stage rocket. The final stage of the rocket achieved the predetermined speed and sent the automatic interplanetary station into the required orbit.

The selection of the automatic interplanetary station's orbit ensures that it passes near the moon and orbits it.

The automatic interplanetary station will pass at a distance of approximately 10,000 kilometers from the moon, and during its continued operation after passing the moon, it will pass through the Earth's region. The selected orbit ensures that people can observe this automatic interplanetary station from the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth.

The final stage of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket weighs 1,553 kilograms (excluding fuel).

The automatic interplanetary station is installed on the final stage of the rocket. After entering orbit, the automatic interplanetary station has separated from the rocket. The final stage of the rocket is operating along an orbit close to the orbit of the automatic interplanetary station. The automatic interplanetary station is used to conduct extensive scientific research in cosmic space. The automatic interplanetary station is equipped with scientific instruments and radio technology instruments, as well as an automatic temperature adjustment system. The electrical energy for the scientific instruments and radio technology instruments is supplied by solar cells and chemical power sources. The total weight of the automatic interplanetary station is 278.5 kilograms. In addition, measuring instruments with energy equipment, weighing 156.5 kilograms, are installed on the final stage of the rocket. Thus, the total weight of the effective payload is 435 kilograms.

Scientific information and measurement results of the automatic interplanetary station's operating parameters will be transmitted by two radio transmitters with frequencies of 39.986 MHz and 183.6 MHz. At the same time, the orbital elements of the automatic interplanetary station will be calibrated through a radio circuit with a frequency of 183.6 MHz.

The signal from the 39.986 MHz transmitter is a pulse with alternating lengths from 0.2 to 0.8 seconds, with a pulse repetition frequency of 1 + - 0.15 cycles.

The information from the automatic interplanetary station will be transmitted in batches for two to four hours each day according to the observation plan. The operation of the instruments on the automatic interplanetary station will be controlled by the adjustment calculation center on the ground.

Automatic measuring instrument stations are set up throughout the Soviet Union, and these complete sets of measuring instruments will be used to measure the rocket's parameters.

All Soviet radio stations will broadcast information about the operation of the third cosmic rocket.

The most recent operation of the radio technology equipment will begin at 13:00 Moscow time on October 4th. At this time, the rocket will be located over the Indian Ocean, with coordinates of 80 degrees east longitude, 5 degrees south latitude, and a distance of 108,000 kilometers from the Earth. The operation time of the radio technology equipment will last approximately two hours.

Radio observations of the rocket can be carried out on the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.

The launch of the third Soviet cosmic rocket and the establishment of an automatic interplanetary station will make it possible to obtain new data about cosmic space. This is another contribution by the Soviet people to international cooperation in the conquest of the universe.

    苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭　对人类征服宇宙又作出巨大贡献
    建立围绕月球飞行的自动行星际站
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社4日发表了关于苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭的公报。公报全文如下：
    根据研究宇宙空间和准备行星际飞行的计划，苏联于1959年10月4日成功地发射了第三个宇宙火箭。在火箭上安装有自动行星际站。
    这次的发射是用多级火箭进行的。最后一级火箭获得了预定的速度，已经把自动行星际站送到所要求的轨道上。
    自动行星际站轨道的选择，保证它经过月球附近并围绕月球飞行。
    自动行星际站将在距离月球约一万公里的地方通过，它在绕过月球、继续运行中，将在地球区通过。选定的轨道保证人们能够从地球的北半球观测这个自动行星际站。
    苏联第三个宇宙火箭的最后一级重一千五百五十三公斤（燃料不计算在内）。
    自动行星际站安装在最后一级火箭上。自动行星际站在进入轨道后，已经脱离火箭。最后一级火箭沿着与自动行星际站轨道靠近的轨道运行。自动行星际站是用来在宇宙空间进行广泛的科学研究的。自动行星际站上安装有科学仪器和无线电技术仪器，以及自动调整温度的系统。科学仪器和无线电技术仪器的电能是由太阳能电池和化学电源供应的。自动行星际站的总重量是二百七十八点五公斤。此外，在最后一级火箭上安装着带有能源设备的测量仪器，重一百五十六点五公斤。这样，有效负荷的总重量为四百三十五公斤。
    科学情报和自动行星际站运行参数的测量结果，将由两架无线电发射机发出，它们的频率为三九点九八六兆周和一百八十三点六兆周。同时，将通过频率为一百八十三点六兆周的无线电路，对自动行星际站的轨道要素进行校对。
    频率为三九点九八六兆周的发射机的讯号是交替长度从零点二到零点八秒的脉冲，脉冲重复频率为1＋－（即正负号）零点15周。
    自动行星际站的情报将根据观测计划分次每天发送两小时到四小时。自动行星际站上仪器的工作将由地面上的调整计算中心进行控制。
    苏联各地设有自动化测量仪器站，将通过这些成套的测量仪器来测量火箭参数。
    苏联的所有电台都将广播关于第三个宇宙火箭运行的情报。
    无线电技术设备最近一次工作将从10月4日莫斯科时间十三点开始。这时，火箭将位于印度洋上空，座标是东经八十度，南纬五度，距地球十万零八千公里。无线电技术设备一次工作的时间将持续两小时左右。
    欧洲、亚洲、非洲和澳洲大陆都可以对火箭进行无线电观测。
    苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭和建立自动行星际站，将使得有可能得到有关宇宙空间的新资料。这是苏联人民对征服宇宙方面的国际合作的又一个贡献。
