Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: The national raw timber production broke the conventional slack season record in the third quarter, creating a brand new record. According to statistics from the Ministry of Forestry based on telephone reports from various regions, a total of 11,523,000 cubic meters of timber were shipped from all forest areas during the quarter, an increase of 36% over the same period last year; an increase of 14% over the first quarter, and an increase of 8.8% over the second quarter. As of the end of September, 84.8% of the annual plan has been completed.

The general situation of raw timber production in the third quarter is: the mass upsurge of overproduction is constantly rising, and production achievements are rising month by month. August increased by 300,000 cubic meters compared with July, and September increased by another 1 million cubic meters compared with August. Heilongjiang Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the main producing areas, both overfulfilled the third quarter plan ahead of schedule.

Raw timber production in the third quarter is often affected by some natural conditions. In the forest areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, there is a lot of rain and the roads are muddy, and the transportation conditions on forest roads and railways are poor. In the southern provinces, the rainfall is reduced, which is a favorable period for timber transportation by large rivers, but the water in small rivers is shallow, making timber floating difficult. Therefore, the third quarter has always been regarded as the off-season for raw timber production.

However, this year, due to the leadership of politics and the large-scale mass movement in various forest areas, the idea that man will conquer nature has been strengthened, and the off-season has been turned into a peak season. Party and government leading cadres in the forest areas of Heilongjiang Province have gone deep into the front line of production to participate in and lead production. Since August, forestry workers across the province have implemented more than 10,000 technical innovations aimed at key production aspects, making production rise steadily. In early August, the daily output of timber in the province was 33,000 cubic meters; since September, the daily output has reached more than 42,000 cubic meters. Ten forestry bureaus in Jilin Province launched a red flag competition for high output, high quality, high efficiency, and low cost, and vigorously promoted various new timber collection tools, such as wooden sliding tracks, wooden rail flatcars with wooden wheels, and wooden rail sliding bars, which improved work efficiency by more than one time compared with manual timber collection, in response to the lack of timber collection strength. The Second Work Section of the Linjiang Forestry Bureau in Jilin Province carried out three comparisons in the competition (comparing good task completion, good mechanical maintenance, and good safety production), compared daily, evaluated every ten days, and rewarded at the end of the month, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and production efficiency increased by 11.9% compared with the past. In September, the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia were filled with continuous rain, and the working conditions in the forest area were very bad, but under the call and encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers set off a new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy, held swearing-in rallies, and launched competitions, putting forward the slogan of "hard work in rainy days, and large-scale work in rainless days," and their morale was very high. In addition to the fact that the entire autonomous region has overfulfilled the third quarter plan ahead of schedule, eight forestry bureaus have also completed the annual timber production plan ahead of schedule. The southern forest areas have also vigorously grasped the collection of timber in the mountains and the floating of small streams, and launched a mass movement to rush to transport timber, and have closely linked up with shipping and transportation departments to vigorously carry out cooperation to ensure the progress of timber transportation.

At present, the national timber production front is continuing to deepen the anti-rightist struggle, boost morale, and fight hard in the fourth quarter to strive to overfulfill this year's raw timber production plan ahead of schedule. (Attached picture)

　　干劲大战胜阴雨　闹革新横扫困难
    全国木材生产淡季变旺季
    各林区三季度运出的木材比前两季度都多比去年同期增36％
    新华社19日讯　全国第三季度原木生产打破淡季常规，出现了崭新的纪录。据林业部根据各地电话汇报统计，全季度各林区共运出木材一千一百五十二万三千立方米，比去年同期增加36％；比第一季度增加14％，比第二季度增加8.8％。累计到9月底为止，年计划已完成84.8％。
    第三季度原木生产总的形势是：群众性的超产运动不断高涨，生产成绩月月上升，8月份比7月份增加三十万立方米，9月又比8月增加一百万立方米。主要产区的黑龙江省和内蒙古自治区都提前超额完成第三季度计划。
    原木生产在第三季度常常受到一些自然条件的影响。在东北、内蒙古林区，雨多道路泥泞，林区公路、铁路运输条件较差；南方各省雨量减少，大河运材是有利时期，但小河水浅，木材流送困难。因此第三季度一向被看做原木生产的淡季。
    但是，今年各林区由于政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，坚定了人定胜天的思想，却把淡季变成了旺季。黑龙江省各林区党政领导干部都深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产。全省林业职工针对生产关键，从8月以来实现了一万多项技术革新，使生产节节上升。8月上旬，全省木材日产量为三万三千立方米；9月以来，日产量就达到四万二千立方米以上。吉林省十个森工局开展了高产、优质、高效率和低成本的红旗竞赛，并针对集材力量不足的情况大力推广各种集材新工具，如木板滑道、木轨木轮平车、木轨滑杠等，比人力集材提高工效一倍多。吉林省临江森工局第二工段在竞赛中进行三比（比完成任务好、比机械保养好、比安全生产好），日日比、旬旬评、月末奖励，大大激发了职工的积极性和创造性，生产效率比过去提高了11.9％。内蒙古大兴安岭9月份阴雨连绵，林区工作条件很不好，但是职工们在党的八届八中全会的号召鼓舞下，掀起了增产节约运动新高潮，纷纷举行誓师大会，打擂比武，提出“雨天苦战，无雨大干”的口号，斗志十分昂扬。除全自治区已提前超额完成第三季度计划外，并有八个林业局提前完成了全年木材生产计划。南方各林区也大抓山场集材和小溪流送，掀起了抢运木材的群众运动，并且和航运、交通等部门密切联系，大搞协作，保证了运材进度。
    目前，全国木材生产战线正在继续深入反右倾、鼓干劲，大战第四季度，为提前超额完成今年原木生产计划而奋斗。（附图片）
