    Advancing Along the Path from Indigenous to Foreign
    The Communist Party Committee of the Manghe Steel Plant, Jiyuan County

    Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, all the employees of our Manghe Steel Plant in Jiyuan County have earnestly implemented the policy of "simultaneous development of indigenous and foreign methods" and "transition from indigenous to foreign methods," vigorously launched mass movements, seized technical revolution, and deeply carried out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. For nine and a half months, we have been breaking targets every month and adding records every day, achieving simultaneous leaps in both quantity and quality. As of September 30th, we have produced more than 14,000 tons of iron, completing 112% of the state-allocated annual iron production plan of 12,500 tons three months ahead of schedule. Among them, 92% meet the quality standards stipulated by the state. The average utilization coefficient of the 35 indigenous blast furnaces currently in production is 1.7 tons of iron per cubic meter of volume per day and night. Indeed, "each furnace produces more than one ton per day, and each piece of pig iron is of high quality." The cost has been reduced from the original 600 yuan to the current 190 yuan, and a net profit of more than 400,000 yuan has been obtained in the past nine months. Through the mass movement of large-scale steelmaking, we have not only produced iron but also cultivated people; we have not only supported national construction but also developed local industry, and also promoted agricultural production, and consolidated the people's communes. Before the large-scale steelmaking, the Jiyuan Machinery Factory could only produce and repair small agricultural implements due to a lack of steel equipment. After the large-scale steelmaking, in the summer harvesting and planting season alone, it supplied farmers with 130,000 pieces of sickles, hoes, and repairs to various agricultural implements. The boiler-turbine units, water turbines, centrifugal pumps, and small steel mills that have already been produced are warmly welcomed by the masses. These facts fully refuted the right-leaning opportunists' fallacies that the mass movement of large-scale steelmaking was "not worth the loss" and that the "small indigenous groups have failed."

    The earnest implementation of the policy of "simultaneous development of indigenous and foreign methods" and "transition from indigenous to foreign methods" is the fundamental reason why the Manghe Steel Plant has achieved the above achievements. As early as today last year, when the Party issued the great call for "all the people to make steel," the right-leaning opportunists shook their heads and gesticulated, saying, "Hey! Farmers can make iron, what a strange thing!" Soon, the ironclad facts refuted them. Farmers can not only make iron, but also make money. Of course, it is not without difficulties, but it depends on your attitude towards difficulties. Let's start with the innovation of furnace types! The Manghe Steel Plant only had some blast furnaces that were ancient furnace types used to cast plowshares five hundred years ago, with a volume of only 0.3 cubic meters. When this type of furnace tapped iron, it had to be tilted by manpower, which was labor-intensive and unsafe. Therefore, the plant's Party committee put forward the slogan of "vigorously carrying out furnace type innovation to ensure high yield and high quality." Wang Mingsheng, a furnace worker in the smelting workshop, was the first to actively respond. However, when he and other technicians studied it, the other party gave a disappointing answer: "The plow furnace has a bad fire, you can learn it but you can't change it." Some people who held on to the old almanac took this opportunity to say sarcastically: "Smelting iron and casting plowshares is not a simple technology. Apart from Zheng, Shi, and Duan (three iron smelting teachers), everyone else is an amateur." Based on this situation, the plant's Party committee strengthened the political and ideological leadership of the broad masses of employees and launched a debate among the broad masses with the topic of "Can the plow furnace automatically flow iron?" Through debate, we unified our understanding and liberated our minds. The secret of the plow furnace was finally revealed. They used the method of proportional increase and decrease to thicken the furnace wall to five feet and enlarge the diameter of the furnace belly to three feet two inches. The furnace was built on the first day, ignited on the second day, and on the third day, a furnace of red-hot iron water poured straight out, and the output increased sharply from 400 jin to 1,000 jin, 2,000 jin, 3,000 jin..., and finally broke the 10,000 jin mark. This good news caused a sensation in every corner of the plant. Those who originally thought that "the plow furnace has a bad fire and can only be learned but not changed" had to bow their heads in praise in the face of the ironclad facts: "A big belly eats more and produces a high yield, a thick wall keeps warm and produces good iron, building a furnace is easy and doesn't cost money, the technology is simple and the life is long."

    With the implementation of the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the victory of furnace type innovation, the confidence of the broad masses of employees was further boosted. They deeply realized the importance of the policy of "walking on two legs" and "simultaneous development of indigenous and foreign methods" from practice. However, there was still disagreement on how to transition from indigenous to foreign methods. One group advocated that to transition from indigenous to foreign methods, we should abandon the "small indigenous groups" and vigorously develop "large foreign groups." Another group believed that "large" and "small," "indigenous" and "foreign" are compared. They said: "Compared with the plow furnace, the big-bellied furnace is big; if the big-bellied furnace is compared with the 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace, it is obviously small again; but if the 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace is compared with the hundreds of cubic-meter blast furnaces, it will also appear small." Therefore, they advocated that we cannot look at problems in isolation from history, but must be "from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, gradually improve, and step by step." On the existing level of technology and equipment, we must change from "indigenous" to "foreign," otherwise it will cause "foreign" to fail and "indigenous" to be unsuccessful. The plant's Party committee greatly supported the latter understanding and practice, and further proposed the slogan of reforming furnace types. Finally, in March, the Second Workshop first sounded the horn of changing from indigenous to foreign. On the basis of the big-bellied furnace, the advantages of easy furnace construction and high output of the indigenous blast furnace and the advantages of perfect equipment and good quality of the foreign blast furnace were cleverly combined, and a semi-indigenous and semi-foreign furnace with an average daily output of more than three tons of qualified iron was built. Since then, the ancient plow furnace, which has a history of five hundred years, has undergone five steps and twelve changes, and the Jiyuan-style indigenous and foreign combined simple blast furnace was born.

    Comprehensively carrying out mass technical revolution and launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy is also an important reason why the Manghe Steel Plant has achieved the above achievements. With the implementation of the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Industry Conference on layout and location, in order to support agricultural production, the Manghe Steel Plant has successively mobilized thousands of laborers to transfer to the agricultural front. The number of people has been greatly reduced, and the equipment has not increased. In this case, some people lacked confidence. At that time, the plant's Party committee earnestly adhered to putting politics in command and strengthened the ideological leadership of the broad masses of employees. From inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, through explaining the important significance of technical revolution from the front, we reversed the negative emotions of some people who believed that "personnel reduction should be accompanied by equipment increase, and equipment increase should be accompanied by task reduction." And put forward the slogan of "ask Mang River for power, ask Mang River for iron and steel," and guide the spirit of hard work and hard work of the broad masses of employees to clever work. Shi Delian, the furnace chief of No. 1 Blast Furnace, said: "Don't be afraid of fewer people, only be afraid of less enthusiasm. With a great technical revolution, one person can top ten people." Miao Sihui, the former technology section chief of the First Workshop, said: "Mang River can irrigate the land, generate electricity, grind flour, and gin cotton. Why can't it help us make iron?" He was determined to make a miraculous achievement and solve the problem of power for ironmaking. However, he put in a lot of effort and made a wooden water turbine, which was destroyed upon seeing water. At this time, some people who held on to the "old almanac" began to say sarcastically: "If a weasel could grind, who would buy a donkey? If Miao Sihui could make a water turbine, then the water turbine factories in Tianjin and Shanghai should close down!" Although Miao Sihui was very angry, he was not discouraged. On the contrary, his indomitable fighting spirit became stronger. Finally, after three sleepless nights and six experiments, a water turbine that could top two ten-horsepower boiler-turbine units was made. In the past year, one-third of the blast furnaces in the plant have used hydraulic blowing, which has not only overcome the difficulty of insufficient power, but also saved more than a dozen boiler-turbine units, 1,200 tons of coal, thousands of kilograms of oil, and 1,200 laborers, totaling more than 50,000 yuan. In one year, the entire plant has remodeled and created more than 120 kinds of tools, more than 4,800 pieces, and the work efficiency has generally increased by one to five times. More than 80% of the employees have participated in this great technical revolution movement. As a result, the entire plant has rapidly realized ten modernizations, including mining blasting, high-altitude cableway ore transportation, transportation vehicles, vehicle track rubber tires, blowing hydraulic electricity, charcoal sieves, semi-mechanical crushing, large-bellied furnace types, operation technology, and semi-mechanical cooking utensils. All of these have played a huge role in reducing labor intensity, improving labor efficiency, producing more iron, producing good iron, and reducing costs.

    At the same time, the plant's Party committee has always adhered to the education of the broad masses of employees on careful calculation, long-term accumulation, increasing production and practicing economy, and running factories diligently and thriftily. We have adopted the method of determining furnaces based on machines, determining production based on furnaces, determining consumption based on production, and rewarding overproduction. We have established nine major members, including production technology, cost accounting, and material management, in furnace groups and mining pits, so that workers can participate in factory management with the attitude of masters. Cadres have participated in labor by taking turns to go down to the lower levels and follow production, so that the broad masses of employees have always maintained a happy spirit, active work, high morale, and soaring enthusiasm. In the past year, they have used their spare time to pick out 1,800 tons of coke and 260 tons of broken iron from the iron slag, and returned more than 4,000 old tools, totaling more than 220,000 yuan. The masses happily said: "Picking charcoal and picking iron, increasing production and practicing economy, melons are inseparable from vines, and the factory is the home of the workers." Through long-term political and ideological education, especially strengthening the education of long-term planning, every worker has broadened their horizons and recognized the future, and has undergone profound changes in their ideological awareness and mental outlook. Many workers have planted fruit trees around their residences, greening the environment, raising pigs and chickens, growing vegetables, and painting the walls in preparation for picking fruits and enjoying the cool and improving their lives in the future. The employees are all satisfied and say: "We can work in the factory until we are old and gray and we don't want to go home."

    The entire staff of the Manghe Steel Plant has recently studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Everyone has overcome right-leaning tendencies and everyone has redoubled their efforts. The output of iron in September increased by more than 40% compared to August. They are determined to overproduce 4,000 tons to complete the annual iron production plan and continue to advance victoriously along the broad road of "simultaneous development of indigenous and foreign methods" and "transition from indigenous to foreign methods."

    沿着由土到洋的道路前进
    中共济源县漭河钢铁厂委员会
    我们济源县漭河钢铁厂的全体职工，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，认真执行了“土洋并举”“由土到洋”的方针，大搞群众运动，大抓技术革命，深入开展增产节约运动，9个半月来，月月突破指标，日日记录添码，产量、质量双双跃进。截至9月30日，共产生铁一万四千多吨，提前三个月，完成了国家分配的全年产铁一万二千五百吨计划的112％。其中92％都合乎国家规定的质量标准。目前正在生产的三十五座土高炉的平均利用系数是一立方米容积一昼夜产铁一点七吨，真个是：“炉炉日产超一吨，块块生铁都优质。”成本在六百元的基础上已下降到目前的一百九十元，九个月来已获净利四十多万元。通过大炼钢铁的群众运动，既炼了铁，也炼了人；既支援了国家建设，又发展了地方工业，还推动了农业生产，巩固了人民公社。大办钢铁以前，济源机械厂因缺乏钢材设备只能生产和修配小件农具；大办钢铁以后，仅在夏收夏种季节里，就供应农民镰刀、锄头和修配各种农具达十三万件，已经出厂的锅驼机、水轮机、离心式水泵、小钢磨等产品，更是受到广大群众热烈欢迎。这些事实，充分驳倒了右倾机会主义分子所谓大炼钢铁的群众运动是“得不偿失”、“小土群失败了”等谬论。
    认真执行“土洋并举”“由土到洋”方针，是漭河钢铁厂取得上述成就的根本原因。早在去年的今天，党发出“全民办钢铁”伟大号召，那时右倾机会主义分子就摇着头，指手划脚的说：“嘿！农民会炼铁，怪事！”不久，铁的事实，回击了他们，农民不仅会炼铁，而且赚了钱。当然不是没有困难，而是看你对待困难的态度。就从炉型的革新说起吧！漭河钢铁厂当时仅有的一些高炉，还是早在五百年以前人们用来烧铸犁面的古老炉型，容积只有零点三立方米。这种炉出铁水时须用人力扛抬倾斜炉体，费劳力，不安全。于是，厂党委提出了“大搞炉型革新，保证高产优质”的号召。冶炼车间炉前工王明升首先积极响应。但是，当他和别的技术员研究时，对方却给予失望的回答：“犁炉火性歹，能学不能改”，一些抱老皇历的人更趁此说起风凉话：“炼铁铸犁面，技术不简单，除过郑、史、段（三个炼铁老师），都是门外汉。”据此情况，厂党委一方面加强了对广大职工的政治思想领导，并以“犁面炉能否自动流铁水”为题，在广大群众中开展了鸣放辩论。通过辩论，统一了认识，解放了思想。犁面炉的秘密终于揭破了。他们用比例增减的办法，把炉墙加厚到五尺，炉肚直径放大为三尺二寸。头天建炉，二天点火，三天头上一炉通红的铁水直倾而出，产量由四百斤骤增至一千斤，两千斤，三千斤……，最后竟突破了万斤大关。这一喜讯轰动了全厂各个角落，原来那些认为“犁炉火性歹、能学不能改”的人，在铁的事实面前，也不得不低头赞许：“肚大吃多产量高，墙厚保温出好铁，建炉容易不花钱，技术简单寿命长。”
    随着党的八届六中全会精神的贯彻和炉型革新的胜利，进一步鼓舞了广大职工的信心，他们从实践中深刻体会到“两条腿走路”“土洋并举”方针的重要性。但对如何由土到洋认识仍不一致，一种人主张，要由土到洋就该扔掉“小土群”大搞“大洋群”。另一种人则认为“大”和“小”，“土”和“洋”，是比较出来的。他们说：“犁面炉和大肚炉比，大肚炉是大的；大肚炉若再与十三立方米小高炉比，显然又成小的了；可是十三立方米小高炉再与几百立方米高炉比也就显得小了。”因而他们主张不能隔断历史看问题，必须是“由小到大，由土到洋，逐步提高，循序渐进。”在现有技术设备水平上由“土”变“洋”，否则会造成“洋”不成、“土”不就。厂党委大大支持了后一种认识和作法，并进一步提出了改革炉型的号召。终于在3月份，二车间首先吹响了由土变洋的号角，在大肚炉基础上，把土高炉建炉容易产量高和洋高炉设备完善质量好的优点，巧妙的揉合在一起，又建成了日产合格铁平均三吨以上半土半洋的炉子。从此延续五百年历史的古老犁面炉，历经五步十二改，济源式土洋结合的简易高炉诞生了。
    全面的大搞群众性的技术革命，开展增产节约运动，也是漭河钢铁厂取得上述成就的一条重要原因。随着省委钢铁工业会议布局定点指示的贯彻实施，为了支援农业生产，漭河钢铁厂先后动员了几千名劳力转到农业战线上去，人员大减，设备未增。在这种情况下，有些人信心不足。当时，厂党委认真坚持了政治挂帅，加强了对广大职工的思想领导，从党内到党外，由干部到群众，通过从正面讲解技术革命的重要意义，扭转了部分人所认为的“人员减少应添设备，设备不增应减任务”的消极情绪。并提出“向漭水要动力，向漭水要钢铁”的口号，把广大职工实干、苦干的精神引导到巧干上来。一号高炉炉长史德莲说：“不怕人员少，只怕干劲小，技术大革命，一人顶十人”。原一车间技术股长苗思会说：“漭水能浇地、能发电、能磨面、轧花，为什么不能帮助我们炼铁呢？”他决心立奇功，解决炼铁的动力问题。可是他费了九牛二虎之力，制成了一个木制水轮机，见水即毁。这时一些抱“老皇历”的人又说起了风凉话：“黄鼠狼要能拉磨谁还买驴，苗思会要能制成水轮机，那天津、上海的水轮机工厂可该关门哩！”苗思会虽然很生气，但他并没有灰心，相反，他那不屈不挠的斗志更加坚强，终于经过三个不眠之夜，六次试验，一个可顶两个十马力锅驼机的水轮机制成了。一年来全厂有三分之一的高炉是用水力鼓风，不仅克服了动力不足的困难，而且节约了十几部锅驼机，一千二百吨煤炭，几千斤机油和一千二百多个劳力，总值五万多元。一年的时间，全厂共改制创造各种工具一百二十多种，四千八百多件，工效普遍提高一至五倍，有80％以上的职工都参加了这一伟大的技术革命运动。从而使全厂迅速地实现了开矿爆破、高空索道运矿、运输车子、车子轨道胶轮、鼓风水力电气、拣炭筛子、粉碎半机械、炉型大肚、操作技术、炊具半机械等十化。这些都对减轻劳动强度，提高劳动效率，多产铁，产好铁，降低成本起着巨大作用。
    与此同时，厂党委始终坚持了对广大职工精打细算、细水长流、增产节约、勤俭办厂的教育。采取以机定炉、以炉定产、以产定消耗、超产奖励的办法。以炉组、矿坑为单位建立生产技术、成本核算、料物保管等九大员，使工人都以主人翁的姿态参加工厂管理；干部采取了以轮流下放、跟班生产办法参加劳动，使广大职工始终保持了精神愉快，工作积极，情绪高涨，干劲冲天。一年来他们就利用工隙时间在炼过铁矿渣中拣焦炭一千八百吨，拾碎铁二百六十吨，交回旧工具四千多件，总值二十二万多元，群众高兴的说：“拣炭拾铁，增产节约，瓜儿不离秧，工人厂是家”。通过长期的政治思想教育，特别是加强远景规划的教育，使每个工人都开阔了眼界，认清了前途，从思想意识和精神面貌上起了深刻的变化。许多工人都在住室周围栽了果树，绿化环境，喂猪养鸡，种菜，粉刷墙壁，以备将来采果乘凉，改善生活。职工们都满意的说：“我们在厂干到白头到老也不想回家了”。
    漭河钢铁厂的全体职工，近日又学习了党的八届八中全会文献，人人克服右倾，个个再鼓干劲，9月份铁的产量比8月份提高了40％多，他们决心为超产四千吨完成全年产铁计划，继续遵循着“土洋并举”“由土到洋”的康庄大道乘胜前进。
