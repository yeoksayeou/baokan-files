Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd - TASS reported: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin received British Ambassador Reilly on October 3rd and handed him a note. The note read as follows:

The Soviet Government has the honor to inform the British Government that the Cambodian Government has submitted to the Soviet Government, one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, for its consideration, a proposal from the British Government to abolish the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Cambodia.

The Soviet Government cannot but express its surprise at this step taken by the British Government. The British Government's submission of such a proposal to the Cambodian Government is absolutely incompatible with its obligations as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference to do its utmost to ensure compliance with the Geneva Accords on Cambodia.

The aforementioned proposal made by the British Government to the Cambodian Government is in fundamental violation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords on Cambodia, particularly in that questions concerning the activities of the International Commission fall within the competence of the Commission itself, and are stipulated by Article 25 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia.

The Soviet Government cannot but draw attention to the fact that by taking this unilateral action, the British Government is circumventing the tradition of discussing the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Indochina by the two chairmen. Judging from the Geneva Accords on Cambodia, the action taken by the British Government is clearly without legal basis and is a serious violation of the provisions of the aforementioned Accords.

The Soviet Government believes that the attempt to abolish the International Commission for Cambodia can only be based on the desire to eliminate an international body that can prevent certain forces outside Cambodia from realizing their plans to subordinate Cambodia's policies to foreign interests that are incompatible with the interests of the Cambodian people. In this regard, it is impossible not to point out the lamentable example of Laos, a country that has been plunged into national division due to the disruption of the work of the International Commission, creating a civil war and thus a genuine threat to peace in Indochina with all sorts of dangerous consequences. The British Government's proposal to Cambodia to abolish the International Commission in that country sheds new light on the events occurring in Laos. It is now evident that the British Government's opposition to the resumption of the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos is part of an overall plan to abolish all International Commissions in Indochina.

The Soviet Government cannot but feel deeply regret that the British Government has assumed such an unsavory role. It cannot but be seen that the British Government's proposal to the Cambodian Government to abolish the International Commission for Cambodia - a commission that has maintained normal cooperation with the Cambodian government in the past and present - is nothing more than advocating the destruction of the Geneva Accords.

The Soviet Government believes that the question of the International Commission should only be resolved on the basis of the Geneva Accords on Indochina, and therefore it cannot agree to any measures taken against the International Commission for Cambodia that violate the aforementioned Accords.

### 苏联政府照会英国政府  反对取消柬埔寨国际委员会  指责英国企图破坏日内瓦协议

    苏联政府照会英国政府
    反对取消柬埔寨国际委员会
    指责英国企图破坏日内瓦协议
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联外交部副部长佐林10月3日接见了英国大使赖利，并且交给他一份照会。照会内容如下：
    苏联政府荣幸地通知英国政府：柬埔寨政府已经交给作为日内瓦会议主席之一的苏联政府一项英国政府希望取消柬埔寨国际监察和监督委员会的建议，供它研究。
    苏联政府不能不对英国政府的这一步骤表示惊讶。英国政府向柬埔寨政府提出这样的建议，同它作为日内瓦会议主席之一从而应当尽力促使关于柬埔寨的日内瓦协议得到遵守的义务是决不相容的。
    英国政府向柬埔寨政府提出的上述建议根本违反关于柬埔寨的日内瓦协议的条款，特别是违反这一点：关于国际委员会的活动的问题属于委员会本身权限，并且已由关于在柬埔寨停止敌对行动协定第二十五条所规定。
    苏联政府不能不提醒注意：英国政府既然采取这个单方面行动，就是回避了应由两位主席讨论履行关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的问题这一传统。从关于柬埔寨的日内瓦协议看来，英国政府采取的行动显然是没有法律根据的，而且是严重违反了上述协议的条款。
    苏联政府认为，企图取消柬埔寨国际委员会的做法不可能有其他根据，只不过是想取消一个能阻止柬埔寨国外的某些势力实现想使柬埔寨的政策服从于同柬埔寨人民不相容的外国利益的计划的国际机构。在这方面不能不指出老挝的可悲的例子，这个国家已经由于国际委员会的工作遭到破坏而陷入了民族分裂的境地，造成了内战从而会给印度支那和平带来各种危险后果的真正威胁。由于英国政府向柬埔寨提出了关于取消这个国家的国际委员会的建议，可以从新的角度看到在老挝发生的一些事件。现在很明显：英国政府反对恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，是目的在于取消印度支那的所有国际委员会的总的计划的一部分。
    苏联政府对英国政府竟担任了这种不体面的角色这一点不能不感到深深遗憾。不能不看到，英国政府向柬埔寨政府提出的关于取消柬埔寨国际委员会——这个委员会过去和现在一直同柬埔寨政府保持着正常的合作关系——的建议不外是主张破坏日内瓦协议。
    苏联政府认为，关于国际委员会的问题只应在关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的基础上加以解决，因此它不能同意对柬埔寨国际委员会采取任何违犯上述协议的措施。
