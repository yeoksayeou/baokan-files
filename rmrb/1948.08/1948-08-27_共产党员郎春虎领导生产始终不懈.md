【Taihang Telegraph】Since the spring, in Xizhuang Village, Second District of Lingchuan, the masses and Party members, due to a lack of understanding of the Party's policies, coupled with the fact that individual selfish and retaliatory unscrupulous elements privately organized a group to hire poor peasants, investigated household registrations, and registered property, the masses' thoughts were turbulent and production morale was very low. Most Party members also lacked understanding of the Party rectification policy, and their thinking was confused, so the branch had no power to lead the masses in production. In order to overcome this situation, Lang Chunhu, the labor hero and secretary of the village branch, first convened a branch meeting to let Party members discuss the Party's rectification policy and current work tasks, what is the purpose of Party rectification, and whether Party members have a future. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that they were cultivated by the Party and must not leave the Party. Mistakes must be corrected. Party members should not listen to rumors and should actively work. The masses were afraid of equal distribution (absolute average) and dared not produce, so each Party member, in addition to conducting propaganda and explanation, should first voluntarily form a mutual aid group to lead production well, influence and promote everyone, and not let their village produce less grain. So, Party members mobilized the masses to send manure to the fields, repair field embankments, plan sowing, and actively engage in sideline production. The branch often read the newspaper to the masses, explaining that the Party's Land Law Outline is to completely eliminate feudalism, not to struggle against middle peasants, and that Party rectification is to treat illnesses and save people, and to serve the people better. The masses and Party members understood the policy, and their production morale improved further. In March, after Lang Chunhu attended a meeting in the county, he again publicized to everyone the border government's proclamation that whoever sows, harvests, and that labor creates wealth, not struggle. Party rectification is to cure diseases and save people, and to serve the people better. The masses and Party members understood the policy, and their production morale was further improved. In order to enable the whole village to carry out production in an organized manner, and to help the masses, Lang Chunhu voluntarily combined the previous five large mutual aid groups in Xizhuang into nine groups under the conditions that meet the needs of the masses and are easy to lead. Another group was formed during sowing, making a total of ten groups. In the production movement, ideological education was constantly conducted among the masses, and he personally went to the homes of individuals who still had ideological concerns to explain. The entire natural village has seventy-three households, with 586 mu of land. It was originally planned to complete sowing in fifteen days, but under his promotion and the lead of all Party members, it was completed in thirteen days, saving 125 workdays. Later, weeding the first time saved 120 workdays, and weeding the second time saved 80 workdays. According to statistics from the ten groups: fertilizer was generally applied to the millet fields, and 20 mu of turnips were planted on wasteland. Middle peasant Lang Xiaoquan had sixteen carts of manure, which he had not applied to the fields for several years, but this year he applied it all to the fields. In addition, the masses were organized to engage in sideline production during slack farming time, and the ten groups earned 495,000 yuan. One thousand two hundred catties of medicinal materials were organized to be collected by semi-laborers, which could be sold for more than 200,000 yuan. All thirty-five cattle in the village, including eleven cows, gave birth to nine calves this year because the masses were relieved of their worries and took care of them. And four new cows were bought, increasing the total by thirteen. Now, after plowing the land, they are cutting artemisia and scraping wasteland, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, preparing to plant wheat. Because the climate in Xizhuang Village is relatively cold, the masses have no habit of planting wheat. In the past, not even one mu of wheat was planted. Last year, thirty households planted 20 mu of wheat, and this summer harvested 25 stone and two dou, with a good yield of one stone and five dou per mu. This year, they are preparing to expand the wheat fields even more. In order to respond to the Party's call, Lang Chunhu has formulated a preliminary plan for prosperity: his family of four has ten mu of land, one cow, four sheep, and one pig; he plans to buy another cow and six sheep within two years, open up half a mu of wasteland to plant codonopsis pilosula, one mu of rhubarb, and make two new quilts.

　　共产党员郎春虎领导生产始终不懈
    【太行电】陵川二区西庄村，入春以来，群众党员由于不了解党的政策，加以个别自私报复不正派分子私自组织了雇贫农小组，清查户口，登记财产，群众思想动荡不安，生产情绪很低。大部党员亦由于不了解整党政策，思想混乱，因而支部无力量去领导群众生产。该村支部书记劳动英雄郎春虎为克服这种局面，首先召开支部会，让党员讨论党的整党政策与当前工作任务，整党是为啥，党员有没有前途。讨论后，大家一致认为咱是党培养成的，万不能离了党，有错误必须改正，党员不要乱听谣言，都要积极工作。群众怕平分（绝对平均）不敢生产，每个党员除进行宣传解释外，要先自愿结合一个互助组，好好领导生产，影响推动大家，不要叫自己村少打了粮食。于是党员就动员群众往地里送粪，修地堰，计划下种，并积极进行副业生产。支部经常给群众念报，解释党的土地法大纲是要彻底消灭封建，并不是斗争中农，群众的思想情绪才逐渐安定了。三月里郎春虎到县里开了会后，又给大家宣传边府谁种谁收布告，劳动发家不斗争，整党是为了治病救人，更好的为人民服务，群众和党员了解了政策，生产情绪更提高了一步。郎春虎为使全村能有组织的进行生产，并帮助群众把西庄以前的五个大互助组在适合群众要求便于领导的条件下，自愿结合成了九个小组。下种时又结合了一个，共十个组。在生产运动中经常不断的对群众进行思想教育，对个别仍有思想顾虑的，他亲自到家里做解释。全自然村七十三户，地五百八十六亩，原计划十五天完成下种，在他的推动及全体党员带头下，十三天就完成了，省工一百二十五个。以后锄第一次苗省工一百二十个，锄第二次省工八十个。十个组统计：谷地都普遍上了追肥，开荒地种了二十亩蔓菁。中农郎小全有十六车粪，几年没往地里上，今年都上到地里。此外，抽农闲时间组织群众副业生产，十个组赚洋四十九万五千元。组织半劳力采药材一千二百斤，可卖洋二十余万元。全村三十五头牛，十一头母牛，因群众解除了顾虑，操心饲养，今年下了小牛九只。并新买牛四头，共增十三头。现在有的耕完地，正割蒿刮荒，大量积肥，准备种麦。西庄村因气候较冷，群众没有种麦习惯，以前连一亩麦也不种，去年有三十户种了二十亩麦，今夏打了二十五石二斗，好的一亩收成一石五斗。今年更准备扩大麦田。郎春虎为响应党的号召，已订出初步发家计划：他家四口人，十亩地，牛一头，羊四只，猪一只；准备在二年内再买牲口一头，羊六只，开荒种党参半亩，大黄一亩，做新被子两条。
