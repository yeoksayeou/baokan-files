　　*Su Bao* Comments on the Third Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship
　　Chinese People Warmly Welcome It, Reactionary Elements Maliciously Attack It
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: According to a Moscow broadcast on the 13th, G. Kibanov wrote an article commenting on the third anniversary of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." The article stated: The "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance," signed on August 14, 1945, ushered in a new historical stage in the development of friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. People in Chinese society believe that this treaty is the greatest contribution to the cause of world peace, a powerful weapon in the struggle for peace in the Far East, and a reliable guarantee against the resurgence of Japanese aggression. Masinu also published a commentary stating: The Sino-Soviet alliance is a solid fortress against Japanese aggression. Precisely because of this, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has won warm welcome from patriotic people throughout China, while Chinese reactionary elements have attacked it. These reactionary elements have recently intensified this attack because the provisions of the treaty restrict them from actively assisting the United States in expanding its influence on the Japanese issue. The threat posed to China by the US policy of supporting the revival of Japanese aggressive forces further demonstrates to the Chinese people the importance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance for the Chinese people.

　　苏报评中苏友好条约三周年
    中国人民热烈欢迎　反动分子恶意攻击
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据莫斯科十三日广播：基盘诺夫著文评论“中苏友好同盟条约”三周年纪念，该文略称：一九四五年八月十四日签订的“中苏友好同盟条约，”使中苏两大民族友谊的发展进入了新的历史阶段。中国社会人士认为这个条约是对世界和平事业的最大贡献，是在远东争取和平的有力武器，是防备日本侵略死灰复燃的可靠保障。马西努亦发表评论称：中苏同盟是反对日本侵略势力的坚固堡垒，正因为这样，所以中苏友好同盟条约博得全中国爱国人士热烈的欢迎，而中国反动分子方面则予以攻击，这些反动分子最近更加强了这种攻击行动，这是因为条约中的条款束缚着他们在对日问题上积极帮助美国扩张势力。美国的扶植日本侵略势力复活的政策所给予中国的威胁，在中国人民面前更加说明了中苏友好同盟条约对于中国人民的重要性。
