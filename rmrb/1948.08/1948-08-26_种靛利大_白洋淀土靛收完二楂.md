　　【Jizhong Electric】The soil indigo in Baiyangdian, Jizhong, generally finished harvesting its first crop in early July, estimated to yield at least 140,000 jin. Around July 10th, the second crop was also harvested. Except for a small portion of the area where the harvest was reduced due to flooding, the majority of the yield was similar to the first crop, estimated to also yield 120,000 jin. Assuming the highest yield of 130 jin of indigo per mu, the value of indigo from the first and second crops combined could buy more than 11 shi of grain per mu. Even with the lowest yield, the two crops combined could buy more than 7 shi of rice. If it is not continuously flooded, it is also possible to harvest a third, fourth, and fifth crop (the first two crops have the largest harvest). The masses feel that planting indigo yields great benefits. Because the quantity of indigo produced has increased, there is an urgent need to solve the sales problem. The county's promotion agency has helped indigo farmers sell nearly 10,000 jin. The state-owned Longchang Store has also invested 150 million yuan to prepare for large-scale purchases.

　　种靛利大
  　白洋淀土靛收完二楂
    【冀中电】冀中白洋淀土靛于七月初普遍收完头楂，估计最少可收十四万斤。七月十日左右又收完二楂，除小部分地区因被水灾减收外，大部产量和头楂差不多，估计亦可收十二万斤。以每亩最高产靛一百三十斤计，头、二楂加起来，每亩靛价能买十一石多。即以最低产量计，两楂合起来亦可买米七石多。如不续被水淹，还可打三、四、五楂（头两楂收获最大）。群众都感觉种靛收获很大，因为产靛数量增加，当前迫切需要解决推销问题。该县推进社已帮助靛民，推销近万斤。公营隆昌商店亦投资一万五千万元，准备大量收买。
