Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th—The People's Armed Forces Committee of the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, in order to strengthen the struggle against the enemy and support the frontline work, convened a meeting of directors of county-level and above Armed Forces Committees in late July. The meeting decided to consolidate militia organizations and strengthen discipline and policy education, and determined the tasks of the militia in the core areas and border areas.

Regarding the consolidation of militia organizations, in areas that have undergone land reform, the work of rectifying the party should be coordinated, and the movement to evaluate merits and investigate demerits of the militia should be launched under the leadership of the peasant representatives' meeting, adhering to the principle of mass review of the militia. The meeting pointed out the shortcomings of past militia consolidation. On the one hand, the principle of education and transformation was not fully grasped, and there was a lack of specific distinctions between merits and demerits, right and wrong, importance and triviality, and public and private interests. In some places, there was a phenomenon of simple purges. On the other hand, consolidation and development were not well combined, and most areas did not pay attention to absorbing new elements during the consolidation. In the new areas, some places simply developed the militia through administrative mobilization, violating the principles of voluntariness and mass review. The meeting clearly stipulated that the purpose of this review of the militia should be to improve ideology, enforce discipline, strengthen unity, and improve work. During the review, democracy must be widely promoted, and the spirit of education and unity must be used to evaluate merits and investigate demerits, opposing the one-sided practice of severing the entire ideology, work, and performance, and only investigating shortcomings. During the movement, those who have performed tasks, obeyed discipline, and cared for the masses should be commended; those who are passive and lazy, violate discipline, and are divorced from the masses should be criticized, and encouraged to humbly accept criticism and formulate plans for correcting mistakes and making contributions; those who persist in their mistakes and are truly unable to be transformed must be resolutely purged, so that the composition of the militia will be purer and their ideological awareness will be higher. For militia and militia cadres who were reviewed during the land reform in the winter of last year, if there were any improper handling, correct conclusions should be drawn again, and those who should not have stopped working should immediately resume their work. At the same time, new militia should be developed on the basis of evaluating merits and investigating demerits, absorbing young hired peasants, poor peasants, and middle peasants from the countryside to strengthen the militia ranks. In the new areas, during land reform and mass movements such as rent reduction and interest reduction, the tasks and roles of the militia should be thoroughly publicized to enlighten the masses to voluntarily participate in the militia. There should be no rush to develop a large number of militia, and quality should be emphasized rather than quantity. The backbone of the militia must be filled by upright poor peasants. The development of the militia should be reviewed and examined by the poor peasant associations or peasant associations. The meeting also stipulated that the main content of this year's militia winter training is discipline and policy education. First, the training of militia cadres should be completed before this winter, and then universal militia winter training should be carried out to correct the retaliatory behavior such as making a fortune, indiscriminate beatings, killings, and confiscations caused by hatred of the enemy that are prone to occur when the militia enters the new area, and to correct the current undisciplined and anarchic phenomena in the militia organization such as not listening to command and deployment. The meeting stipulated the discipline of the militia. In addition to fully complying with the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," it also formulated a number of disciplinary provisions that should be observed based on the specific circumstances of the militia.

Regarding tasks, the meeting stipulated that the tasks of the militia in the interior are: (1) Protect the interests of the masses, stabilize social order, and suppress the remnants of defeated bandits who have fled from the new areas and some bandits with political backgrounds, but the principle of focusing on winning over and disintegrating and supplementing with military strikes should be grasped. Prevent the restoration and sabotage of individual reactionary landlords, and strengthen defense. (2) The militia is the backbone of participating in the war and supporting the front. There should be constant preparation and organization, overcoming temporary mobilization and disorganized state. (3) The militia should become a model of joining the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, and assist in inspecting the local work of giving preferential treatment to military families, and promoting and educating demobilized soldiers to return to their teams. (4) The militia should play an active role in production and construction and promote labor mutual assistance. The task of the militia in the border areas is to strengthen the struggle against the enemy. The village militia participation teams should be the backbone, establish joint defense operations, launch the explosion movement, and cooperate with the troops in combat.

　　晋绥整理民兵组织
  　加强纪律政策教育
    【新华社晋绥二十日电】晋绥解放区人民武装委员会，为加强对敌斗争和支援前线工作，曾于七月下旬召开县以上武委会主任会议，决定整理民兵组织和加强纪律政策教育，并确定了腹心地区及边沿区民兵的任务。
    关于整理民兵组织，在经过土地改革地区，应配合整党工作，通过农民代表会来领导展开民兵评功查过运动，坚持群众审查民兵的方针。会议指出过去整理民兵的缺点，一方面是没有完全掌握教育改造的方针，缺乏具体分别功过、是非、轻重与为公为私，有些地方发生单纯的清洗现象；另一方面是整理与发展没有很好的结合，大部分地区未注意在整理中吸收新的成份。在新区有些地方单纯以行政动员方式来发展民兵，违背自愿与群众审查的原则。会议明确规定，这次审查民兵的目的应为提高思想、严明纪律、加强团结、健全工作。审查时必须广泛发扬民主、以教育与团结的精神进行评功查过，反对片面的割断整个思想、工作与表现，只查缺点的作法。在运动中应表扬执行任务、遵守纪律、爱护群众的模范者；批评消极怠工、破坏纪律、脱离群众的分子，并鼓励其虚心接受批评，订立改过与立功计划；对个别坚持错误、真正无法改造者，必须坚决清洗之，使民兵成份更加纯洁和思想觉悟更加提高。对去年冬季土地改革中审查过的民兵与民兵干部，如有处理不当者，应重新作出正确结论，不应停止工作的应立即恢复其工作。同时应在评功查过的基础上发展新民兵，吸收农村中雇农、贫农、中农青年，以壮大民兵队伍。新区应在土地改革和减租减息等群众运动中，深入宣传民兵任务与作用，启发群众自愿参加民兵。不可急求大量发展，应重质量，不要仅图数量。民兵骨干必须由正派的贫苦农民充任。发展民兵应经过贫农团或农会的评议与审查。会议又规定今年民兵冬训主要内容为纪律与政策教育。首先应在今冬前完成对民兵干部的训练，再普遍进行民兵冬训，以纠正民兵进入新区参战中容易发生发洋财和由于对敌人的仇恨所引起的乱打、乱杀、乱没收等报复行为，并纠正目前民兵组织中不听指挥与调动等无纪律无政府现象。会议中规定了民兵的纪律，除完全遵守“三大纪律、八项注意”外，还根据民兵具体情况，定出若干应遵守的纪律条文。
    关于任务，会议规定内地民兵为：（一）保护群众利益，安定社会秩序，剿除自新区窜入之溃匪和部分有政治背景的土匪，但应掌握以争取瓦解为主、军事打击为辅的方针。防止个别反动地主的复辟和破坏行为，加强防务。（二）民兵为参战支前的骨干，应有经常准备和组织，克服临时动员和无组织状态。（三）民兵应成为参军优军的模范，并协助检查当地优军工作，推动和教育离队战士归队。（四）民兵在生产建设中应发挥积极性，推动劳动互助。边沿地区民兵任务为加强对敌斗争，以各村民兵参战队为骨干，建立联防作战，展开爆炸运动，配合部队作战。
