Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Comprehensive report: Since the end of the war, the just struggle of the Malayan people, caused by the intensified exploitation and persecution by British imperialism, has erupted into an armed resistance movement under the British authorities' further violent suppression. From late June to the present, in many areas of Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, and Pahang states, the main rubber and tin producing areas within the Federation of Malaya, there have been continuous incidents of people's armed resistance against British military police. In mid-July, people's armed forces attacked the only coal mine in Malaya, the Rawang Coal Mine, only twenty-six miles from Kuala Lumpur (Selangor), the capital of the Federation of Malaya. People's armed forces also burned down the police station in Chong Tho town, 150 miles north of Singapore, capturing four or more policemen (including one officer). According to the Singapore Straits Times of June 28, "Guerrillas numbering four to five thousand are now gathering in the Malayan jungle." British Colonial Secretary Jones admitted, "The situation in Malaya is extremely serious."

The British authorities have repeatedly asserted that this resistance movement is a "communist conspiracy." British Communist MP Gallacher pointed out in the House of Commons on July 23 that "there is no such thing as a Malayan Communist conspiracy. The Malayan Communist Party has completely open and legitimate demands, namely: to fight for independence, and to take the tin and rubber industries out of the hands of the imperialists who control and enslave the Malayan people." News from various sources shows that Britain not only disregards this legitimate demand of the Malayan people but instead intensifies its persecution. British Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies Rees-Williams bluntly stated on July 2 that they would do everything possible "to eliminate the thugs." At the same time, the Malayan authorities promulgated a series of reactionary decrees, stipulating that "anyone carrying weapons or ammunition will be sentenced to death," implementing an identification card system, and imposing control over newspapers. On July 23, progressive groups such as the Malayan Communist Party, the Veterans Association of the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army, the Malayan New Democratic Youth League, and the League to Defend the Malayan Motherland were declared illegal. In the four weeks up to July 19, more than 2,000 progressive elements and democrats who had actively participated in or led the Malayan people's war of resistance against Japan were arrested, including Song Guang, former chairman of the Malayan Anti-Japanese Association (he was once arrested in March 1946, which triggered a mass strike by 500,000 people throughout Malaya), Wu Liusi, advertising manager of the Nanyang Siang Pau and correspondent of the MCP's newspaper "Min Sheng Bao," and Liu Weichang, a former officer of the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (both of whom are transliterations).

Not only that, but the Malayan Federal Government also announced that "the police, army, navy, and air force are jointly engaged in an anti-communist offensive." British aircraft have repeatedly carried out so-called "smoke out" bombings in some areas of Perak and Selangor states. Under the British military police's insane slaughter, Chen Kang (transliteration), chairman of the Johor Rubber Industry Workers' Union, was one of many who were killed. In addition to implementing the above-mentioned fascist terror, Britain is also carrying out vicious political conspiracies, attempting to provoke hatred between the Malay people and overseas Chinese. Some British officials in Malaya even advocated "arming the Malays to fight against 'terrorists'," causing them to kill each other. The British side is particularly trying to divide the unity of all classes of Chinese. The British Acting High Commissioner in Malaya, Newboult, publicly demanded on July 21 that the 2.7 million overseas Chinese in Malaya "contribute their strength... to the government's side" by "joining the auxiliary police force or special security force, or providing information to the police." This conspiracy has been particularly encouraged and supported by the Kuomintang reactionary group. For a long time, the Kuomintang reactionaries have been spreading rumors of a "communist rebellion" in Nanjing and Singapore, and doing their utmost to slander the Malayan people's resistance movement. The Kuomintang's "Singapore Central Daily News" actively supported this after Newboult's speech, calling on the overseas Chinese in Malaya to "assist" the British authorities' atrocities. However, according to the Associated Press, "only a very few" overseas Chinese were deceived and used by the British.

Britain's high-pressure policy on the Malayan incident is clearly being carried out in collusion with US imperialism and with the latter's support. According to a TASS dispatch on July 8, "The reoccupation of the Malayan Peninsula by British armed forces is a task assigned to Britain in the recent meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington." It also stated that "the British press's propaganda campaign against the so-called Malayan terrorist incidents began almost immediately after the Washington conference." According to a United Press dispatch on July 23, "American-made pistols, machine guns, and grenade launchers are being airlifted to Malaya."

However, these violent suppressions and political conspiracies by Anglo-American imperialists have failed to subdue the Malayan people's national democratic movement. According to Agence France-Presse, "The persistence of the unrest in Malaya is causing anxiety in London." Senior British officials and those responsible in London admitted that "this war will be a long one." The British government has encountered "extraordinary difficulties" in restoring order in Malaya by force.

### 反抗英美帝国主义剥削迫害  马来亚人民正义斗争  爆发为武装反抗运动

    反抗英美帝国主义剥削迫害
    马来亚人民正义斗争
    爆发为武装反抗运动
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合报导：战争结束以来，由于英帝国主义加紧剥削与迫害所引起的马来亚人民的正义斗争，在英国当局进一步采取暴力镇压之下，已爆发成为武装的反抗运动。自六月下旬迄今，马来亚联邦境内主要产胶及产锡地带之柔佛、森美兰、雪兰峨、霹雳、彭亨等州的许多地区，连接不断地发生了人民武装抗议英国军警的事件。七月中旬，人民武装攻入距马来亚联邦首府吉隆坡（雪兰峨州）仅二十六哩之马来亚唯一煤矿岭都阿朗煤矿，人民武装亦曾焚毁新加坡以北一百五十哩之钟都镇警察所，俘警察四人以上（内有警官一名）。据新加坡海峡时报六月二十八日载称：“马来亚丛林中现正集结游击队四五千人”，英殖民地大臣琼斯承认：“马来亚情势极端严重。”
    英国官方曾一再武断这一抵抗运动为“共产党的阴谋”。英共议员加拉彻七月二十三日在下院发言时指出：所谓“马来亚共产党的阴谋其实并不存在，马来亚共产党方面有完全公开的合法要求，即：争取独立，锡业及橡胶业应从控制与奴役马来亚人民的帝国主义者手中拿出来”。各方消息显示，英国不仅不顾及马来亚人民这一合法要求，反而变本加厉地施行迫害。英殖民地部次长李斯多威尔七月二日露骨表示：要尽一切力量“以铲除暴徒”。与此同时，马来亚当局颁布了一连串反动法令，规定“凡携带武器或弹药者一律判处死刑”，施行身份证制度，实施对报纸的控制等。七月二十三日，更宣布了马共、马来亚人民抗日军退伍军人协会、马来亚新民主青年团、保卫马来亚祖国联盟等进步团体为非法。至七月十九日的四个星期内，逮捕了曾积极参加或领导马来亚人民抗日战争的进步分子和民主人士二千余人，其中有前马来亚抗日联合会主席宋光（他于一九四六年三月一度被捕，曾引起全马五十万人的抗议大罢业），南侨日报广告部经理兼马共机关报“民声报”通讯员吴柳斯、前马来亚人民抗日军军官刘维昌（上述两人均系译音）等人。
    不仅如此，马来亚联邦政府并宣布“警察、陆、海、空军合力从事反共攻势”。英机迭次在霹雳州、云兰峨州之若干地区，施行所谓“熏死”轰击。在英国军警疯狂屠杀下，柔佛州树胶业工会主席陈康（译音）是许多横遭杀害者当中的一个。英国除了实行上述法西斯的恐怖外，还进行恶毒的政治阴谋，妄图挑拨马来民族仇视华侨。某些马来亚英国官员甚至主张“武装马来人，以抗击‘恐怖主义者’”，使之互相残杀。英方特别图谋分化华侨各阶层人士的团结。驻马来亚英国代理高级专员纽鲍特七月二十一日公然要求马来亚二百七十万华侨“采取加入辅助警察队或特别保安队，或供给警方情报诸方式”，以“贡献力量……于政府这一边”。这一阴谋特别受到国民党反动集团的怂恿和支持。许久以来国民党反动派即在南京和新加坡散布“共产党叛乱”谣言，对马来亚人民抵抗运动极尽污蔑之能事。国民党“新加坡中央日报”此次于纽鲍特谈话之后即积极予以支持，叫马来亚华侨“协助”英当局的暴行。然而，据美联社消息，被欺骗为英方利用的华侨“仅有极少数”。
    英国对此次马来亚事件采取高压政策，显然是与美帝国主义串通一气进行并得到后者之支持的。据塔斯社七月八日电称：“英武装部队之重占马来亚半岛，乃是近来在华盛顿召开的参谋长联席会议中议决交与英国的任务。”并称：“英报界反对所谓马来亚恐怖事件的宣传运动，几乎是在华盛顿会议之后即开始。”据合众社七月二十三日讯：“美造手枪、机枪及掷弹筒正在空运至马来亚。”
    然而，英美帝国主义分子的这些暴力镇压和政治阴谋，均未能压服马来亚人民的民族民主运动。据法新社消息：“马来亚动乱的持久，正在促成伦敦方面的殷切挂念。”英高级官员及伦敦负责方面承认：“此项战事将是长期的。”英政府在借武力恢复马来亚秩序过程中已遭遇“非常的困难”。
