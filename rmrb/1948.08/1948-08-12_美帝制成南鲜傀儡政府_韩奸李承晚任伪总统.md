Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 10th:  Ignoring the opposition of the Korean people, American imperialism is deliberately creating a divided puppet government in South Korea. Following the establishment of the South Korean puppet National Assembly, on July 24th, the number one Korean traitor, Syngman Rhee, and Lee See-young made a show of taking office as the South Korean puppet president and puppet vice president. On the 2nd of this month, the puppet National Assembly, based on Syngman Rhee's recommendation, also approved another Korean traitor, Lee Bum Suk, as the puppet Prime Minister. By the 4th, the puppet cabinet, cobbled together by a gang of villains, was largely formed, with Lee Bum Suk concurrently serving as the puppet Minister of National Defense. Before this puppet government takes the stage on the 15th of this month according to the orders of its American masters, Syngman Rhee, upon receiving instructions from his American masters, hurriedly announced on the 5th that he would first propose "a request that the American occupation forces should remain in South Korea for a longer period" (Associated Press). Syngman Rhee is a notorious lackey of American imperialism who spent 20 years in the United States and has always made it his business to betray the interests of the Korean people. When he returned to Korea by special plane from Washington in October 1945, he received the support of American financial capitalists, the reactionary Catholic Missionary Society of New York, and the support of the American Oriental Mining Company, which supported his activities with one million US dollars, at the cost of selling out the rights to exploit North Korean mines. The Democratic Party he leads is a collection of Korean reactionaries, including big landlords, comprador capitalists, traitors and collaborators from the period of Japanese rule, and reactionary rogue politicians who returned to Korea after the Japanese surrender. Lee Bum Suk is currently the head of the South Korean National Youth Corps, which receives 20 million Korean won in subsidies from the US occupation authorities each year. He graduated from the Kuomintang Central Training Corps and was a member of the former puppet Korean Provisional Government, which was supported by the Kuomintang.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 10th: An American journalist who resided in Korea for more than a year, recently described the situation of the South Korean people living in a terrifying hell under the rule of American imperialism in an article after returning to the United States, saying: "The South Korean people are being detained, tortured, and exploited by their government, and are getting poorer day by day. South Korea's centrists, along with the communists, have been driven underground. I know many people who, simply for criticizing the corrupt and dictatorial government, have been accused of being communists, imprisoned, tortured, or even assassinated. From September 1946 to July 1947, the South Korean police arrested a total of 113,447 people, of whom 96,670 were convicted." "In July 1947 alone, there were 28,852 policemen in South Korea, while in the Japanese era, there were never more than 8,000 Korean policemen and 12,000 Japanese policemen in all of Korea." "Collaborating with the police are gangs called 'Korean Youth Corps,' 'Independence Youth Corps,' and other similar names. Their activities are permitted and condoned by the government. Like the Blackshirts in Italy and the Brownshirts of Hitler, they carry out kidnapping, torture, and massacre. Even the most careful and law-abiding merchants often 'pay their respects' to them, otherwise their shops will be smashed one day."

　　美帝制成南鲜傀儡政府
  　韩奸李承晚任伪总统
    【新华社陕北十日电】美国帝国主义不顾朝鲜人民的反对，蓄意在南鲜制造分裂的傀儡政府。继南鲜伪国会成立以后，七月二十四日，第一号韩奸李承晚与李始荣又粉墨登场，就任南鲜伪总统与伪副总统之职。本月二日，伪国会并根据李承晚的推荐，通过以另一韩奸李范＠为伪内阁总理；至四日，由群丑拼凑的伪内阁大体组成，李范＠亲兼伪国防部长。这一傀儡政府在按照其美国主子命令于本月十五日登台之前，经由李承晚禀承美国主子旨意，于五日赶忙宣布，将首先提出美占领军“应留驻南鲜较久一些的请求”（美联社）。按李承晚为一臭名昭彰的美帝国主义走狗，旅美二十年，素以出卖朝鲜人民利益为能事。他于一九四五年十月由华盛顿乘专机返国时，得到美国金融资本家、纽约反动的天主教传道会等的支持，并获得美国东方矿产公司支持他活动的一百万美元，而这是以出卖北鲜矿山开采权的卖国条件为代价的。他所领导的民主党，是朝鲜反动分子的总汇，其中包括大地主、买办资本家、日本统治时期的奸伪分子、与日本投降后返回朝鲜的反动流氓政客。李范＠现任南韩民族青年团团长，该团每年领受美占领当局津贴两千万韩币，他曾毕业于国民党中央训练团，为前国民党所扶植的重要伪韩国临时府之一分子。
    【新华社陕北十日电】一位在朝鲜居留一年余的美国记者，最近于其返美后的一篇文章中，描述南鲜人民在美国帝国主义统治下的恐怖地狱生活的情况称：“南鲜人民被他们的政府拘禁、拷打、剥削，一天比一天穷了。南鲜的中间派人物也和共产党一道被驱逐到地下。我知道有很多人，只因为曾批评过贪污与独裁的政府，便被控为共产党，被关进监狱，被拷打或甚至被暗杀。由一九四六年九月到一九四七年七月，南鲜的警察一共抓了十一万三千四百四十七人，其中有九万六千六百七十人被判了罪。”“一九四七年七月，单南鲜就有二万八千八百五十二名警察，而在日本人时代，全朝鲜没有一个时候超过八千名朝鲜警察和一万二千名日警。”“和警察们共同作恶的，还有一些叫做‘朝鲜青年团’、‘独立青年团’及其他类似名目的流氓群。他们的活动得到政府的允许和纵容。象意大利的黑衫党和希特勒的褐衫党一样，他们施行着绑架、拷打和屠杀。甚至最小心谨慎和最守法的商人，都时常‘孝敬’他们，假若不如此，他们的商店就有被捣毁的一日。”
