Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Shanghai reliable sources: The Kuomintang government has sold the tungsten mines of Jiangxi, the antimony mines of Xikuangshan in Hunan, and the tin mines of Gejiu in Yunnan to American imperialism as collateral for "U.S. aid." A Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 11th, sourced from the Associated Press, fully confirms this news. The dispatch stated: "The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration announced that 'loans to China will be extended in the form of strategic materials, that is, China will be required to designate proceeds from the sale of strategic materials to repay loans from the Cooperation Administration. The United States needs to obtain more supplies of tin, tungsten, antimony, etc., from China.'" The dispatch also stated: "The medium- and long-term development of the aid-to-China plan will be participated in by the Cooperation Administration, with its funds coming from the economic portion of the aid-to-China plan, totaling $275 million, as well as local currency funds." This indicates that American imperialism will monopolize the development of China's strategic materials such as tungsten, antimony, and tin for a long period. The Administration admitted: "When the Thysselman investigation team was in China, it sent experts deep into Yunnan to investigate mineral resources." Before the war, China's antimony production accounted for 67% of the world's total, and tungsten accounted for 43% of the world's total, ranking first in the world. Tin production ranked fourth in the world. The antimony mine in Xikuangshan, Hunan, accounts for more than 80% of the country's total output, the tungsten mine in Jiangxi accounts for more than 70% of the country's total output, and the tin mine in Gejiu accounts for more than 90% of the country's total output. These are China's three famous non-ferrous metals.

　　In addition, the American plan to monopolize the electricity in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is gradually being implemented. According to a report in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on July 9th: A large electricity trust on the Yangtze River Delta, centered on the American-owned Shanghai Power Company, will receive 100,000 kilowatts of generators from U.S. aid and establish a joint organization, including the American-owned Shanghai Power Plant, Zhabei Power Plant, Pudong Power Plant, Huxi Power Plant, and Nanwu Power Plant. This electricity trust is jointly operated by American and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital and is called a joint company. The Kuomintang government's original so-called "Jiangnan Power Company Plan" has disappeared without a trace. According to an article in the Beiping "New Road" weekly on July 17th: The Kuomintang Resources Committee's Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau will become a signboard, and the American-owned power plant will become the de facto Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau. The U.S. power consultants of the Resources Committee, Weidema and Powell, are deploying a Stars and Stripes power grid in the richest areas of China, including Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai.

　　把宝贵资源作“美援”抵押
  　国民党出卖钨锑锡
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】上海确息：国民党政府已将江西之钨矿、湖南锡矿山之锑矿和云南个旧之锡矿出卖给美帝国主义，作为“美援”之抵押品。中央社华盛顿十一日合众社电完全证实此项消息，该电称：美经济合作总署宣称：“对华贷款将出以战略物资方式，即要求中国划定以出售战略物资之价款，偿还合作总署之贷款。美国需要自华获得更多锡、钨、锑等供应。”该电讯并称：“援华计划之中长期开发，由合作总署参与其事，其基金为援华计划中经济部分之二亿七千五百万美元暨当地货币资金”。此表示美帝国主义将长期垄断中国钨、锑、锡等战略物资之开发。该署承认：“蒂史尔曼调查团在华时曾派遣专家深入云南调查矿产”。按中国的锑战前产量占世界总额百分之六十七，钨占世界总额百分之四十三，向居世界首位，锡产居世界第四位。而湖南锡矿山之锑矿则占全国产量百分之八十以上，江西钨矿占全国产量百分之七十以上，个旧锡矿产量则占全国百分之九十以上。此为我国三大著名有色金属。
    此外，美国垄断国民党统治区电力之计划亦渐付诸实现。据七月九日天津大公报讯：以美商上海电力公司为中心之长江三角洲上之大电力托辣斯，即将获得美援十万千瓦电机，成立一联合机构，内包括上海美商电厂、闸北电厂、浦东电厂、沪西电厂及南乌电厂。此电力托辣斯系由美国和国民党官僚资本合办，名为联合公司。国民党政府原来所谓“江南电力公司计划”，就无声无响地再听不到下文了。另据七月十七日北平“新路”周刊载文透露：国民党资委会江南电力局将成为招牌，美商电厂将成为事实上的江南电力局，资委会的美国电力顾问卫德懋、鲍威尔正在南京、杭州、上海的中国最富庶地区布置一个花旗电力网。
