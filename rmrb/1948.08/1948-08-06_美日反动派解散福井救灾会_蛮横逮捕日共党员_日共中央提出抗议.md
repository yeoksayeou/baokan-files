Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: On June 28th, a major earthquake occurred in the Fukui and Ishikawa prefectures in the central west coast of Honshu, Japan. One-third of the houses in Fukui City collapsed, and more than 1,300 residents of the prefecture died. The Japanese government was perfunctory and negligent in its post-disaster relief work, effectively "doing nothing" for three weeks after the incident. In Maruoka Town, charred corpses were still rotting in the sun. In contrast to the Japanese reactionary government's disregard for the people's suffering, the Japanese Communist Party, together with the Fukui Prefectural Trade Union and other democratic groups, jointly organized a relief committee to vigorously carry out relief work. However, the Fukui City authorities and Japanese police insisted that the committee's work "hindered the restoration and relief work in the earthquake-stricken area," dissolved it, arrested three Japanese Communist Party members on July 9th, and expelled 50 Japanese Communist Party members on July 11th, including JCP Senator Shigeharu Nakano. On the 20th, Colonel Hyland of the U.S. occupation authorities in Fukui Prefecture expelled ten civilian disaster investigation committee members. The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee has protested against this barbaric fascist measure by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Yoshimura, chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union, has also protested. The Liaison Committee of Japanese Trade Unions and Farmers' Associations has decided to launch a protest movement. Note: Fukui Prefecture has long been a production area for Japanese silk and rayon fabrics, and currently accounts for 40 percent of Japan's total silk production. According to "Japanese Economy" magazine, 70 percent of the textile factories in and around Fukui City were destroyed in the earthquake.

    美日反动派解散福井救灾会
    蛮横逮捕日共党员
    日共中央提出抗议
    【新华社陕北四日电】各方报导：六月二十八日，日本本州中部西海岸福井县和石川县地区发生了大地震。福井城内三分之一的房屋倒坍，全县居民死亡一千三百余人。日本政府对于灾区之善后救济工作敷衍怠工，出事三周后，实际上“毫无所为”。在丸岗镇，烧焦了的尸体，尚在太阳下腐烂着。和日本反动政府无视人民的痛苦相反，日本共产党和福井县地方工会及其他民主团体，联合组织了救济委员会，大力进行救济工作。但福井市当局和日警却硬说该委员会的工作“妨害地震灾区之修复及救济工作”，将其解散，并于七月九日将三名日共党员加以逮捕，十一日复将五十名日共党员驱逐出境，其中包括日共参院议员中野重治。二十日，福井县的美军占领当局海兰上校，又将十名民间的灾情调查委员驱逐出境。对于美日反动派这种横蛮的法西斯措置，日共中央已提出抗议。国营铁道工人工会主席吉村，亦已提出抗议。日本工会及农会的联络委员会，已决定发起抗议运动。按：福井县向为日本真丝及人造丝织物之出产地，目前丝的生产量占日本全国百分之四十。据“日本经济”杂志称：福井城内及郊外的纺织厂，百分之七十已毁于此次地震。
