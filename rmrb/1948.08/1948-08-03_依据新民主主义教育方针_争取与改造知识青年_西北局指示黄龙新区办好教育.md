Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th. The Northwest Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on school education in the Huanglong New District, pointing out that running education well in the new district, striving to win over and remold the vast number of educated youth, is one of the important tasks in building the new district. The instructions stated: Although the original schools in the new district were all run by the Kuomintang, carrying out anti-communist and anti-people education, and instilling feudal and enslaving ideas, most of the students' families suffered oppression and damage from the Kuomintang reactionaries. They approve of our party and our army's policies and actions to resolutely protect the interests of the people, so it is entirely possible to win them over and transform them to serve the people. Therefore, the instructions require that all localities should try to get the original schools to open quickly according to local conditions. Capable cadres should be sent to run a few schools well first, in order to promote the good running of the remaining schools. Sub-districts can concentrate on running one or several middle schools well, and counties can concentrate on running one or several complete primary schools well.

The instructions, pointing out the policy of uniting the original local education workers, stated: To help these education workers progress and make them feel at ease to participate in education work, it is necessary to improve them politically and take care of them in life. The material treatment of teachers and staff in the new district should generally not be lower than the salaries during the Kuomintang rule. As for the Kuomintang and San Qing Tuan reactionary organizations in the original schools, they must be resolutely dissolved; however, for the general young students who participated in the party and the league, they should be enthusiastically and actively educated and transformed. Only those who are individually stubborn and unrepentant, and repeatedly striving for transformation proves ineffective, will be expelled. This kind of separate treatment should be regarded as an extremely arduous and meticulous task, and should be carried out on the basis of enlightening their ideological awareness.

Regarding the content of school education, the instructions stated: School education must be carried out in accordance with the New Democratic Education (i.e., education led by the proletariat, anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist education of the people) policy, so that students have the idea of serving the people and a certain amount of scientific and cultural knowledge, and become a new force in the cause of New Democratic construction. In terms of implementation steps, in addition to the leading organs at all levels paying attention to strengthening and improving the quality of school teachers, the curriculum should also be appropriately adjusted: anything that contains feudal and fascist toxins should be immediately suspended or changed in content; those that are not in line with current needs can be reduced or changed to elective courses as appropriate. Textbooks, except for Chinese, history, and geography, which will be gradually supplied by the Border Region Government Education Department, mathematics, physics, and chemistry will temporarily remain the old versions, or be taught after necessary deletions and revisions. Before the formal printing and distribution of political common sense textbooks, current affairs education can be conducted based on the Border Region Mass Daily.

    依据新民主主义教育方针
    争取与改造知识青年
    西北局指示黄龙新区办好教育
    【新华社西北三十日电】中共西北中央局最近发布了于黄龙新区学校教育的指示，指出办好新区教育，争取与改造广大知识青年，为目前建设新区的重要任务之一。指示称：新区原有学校虽都为国民党主办，进行反共反人民的教育，灌输封建奴化思想，但大多数学生家庭都遭受着国民党反动派的压迫和损害，他们对我党我军坚决保护人民利益的政策和行动是赞同的，所以争取改造他们为人民服务是完全可能的。因此，指示要求，各地应根据当地情况设法使原有学校迅速开学。应派得力干部先办好少数学校，以推动办好其余学校。分区可集中办好一个或几个中学，县集中办好一个或几个完小。
    指示指出团结当地原有教育工作者的方针称：要帮助这些教育工作者进步并使他们安心参加教育工作，就必须做到在政治上提高他们与在生活上的照顾他们。对新区教职员的物质待遇，一般应不低于国民党统治时的薪金。至于原有各校中把国民党、三青团反动组织，必须坚决解散；但对于参加党团的一般青年学生，应热情地积极地进行教育改造，只有个别顽固不化、再三争取改造无效者才予开除。此种分别处理，应视为极其艰巨细致的工作，要在启发其思想觉悟的基础上进行。
    关于学校教育的内容方面，指示称：学校教育必须依据新民主主义教育（即无产阶级领导的、人民大众的反封帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义的教育）方针进行，使学生具有为人民服务的思想与一定的科学文化知识，成为新民主主义建设事业的新生力量。实施步骤上，除各级领导机关注意加强和改进学校教员的质量外，并适当调整课程：凡包含封建的和法西斯的毒素的应立即停授或改变内容；其不切合目前需要者，则可酌量减少或改为选修。教材除国文史地由边区政府教育厅陆续供给外，数学、理化则暂依旧本，或加以必要的删改后讲授。政治常识在教材未正式印发前，可根据边区群众日报进行时事教育。
