　　Suspicion Turns to Love
  　The People of Shouyu Rely on Our Party and Our Army
    [North Yue News] Most areas of Shou (yang) Yu (ci) were once occupied by the Yan bandit regime. During the Zhengtai Campaign last year, some of our cadres made mistakes in implementing policies and observing mass discipline, leading many people to become suspicious of our Party and our army. Last August, when the Yan bandits reoccupied the area, they took the opportunity to threaten and lure the masses, causing some people, especially landlords and rich peasants, to flee to enemy-occupied areas such as Taiyuan. After Shouyang City was liberated again this May, the leadership paid special attention to correctly implementing policies and correcting the bad work styles of cadres. It stipulated the action discipline for county and district cadres, opposed all phenomena of detachment from the masses, and comprehensively launched political propaganda and education work among the masses. After fifty days, great achievements have been made. In the past, many people were afraid to see us, but now they all rely on us. The masses generally reflect: "The Eighth Route Army is good! They don't bully or rob, and they are wholeheartedly serving us." Zhou Sanni of Zhang Village in the Eighth District said: "The Eighth Route Army keeps its word, and the lenient policy is really good. If we continue to do this, we will surely win the world." Niu, an 80-year-old Catholic leader in Shouyang City, said: "You are truly saving the country and the people. Yan Xishan was really killing the common people." Li Zhengsan of Zhang Village said: "When the country is righteous, heaven's heart is smooth; when officials are honest, the people are naturally at peace. When the Second War Zone (Yan bandit army) was here, it was like a violent storm, making the people unable to lift their heads; the Eighth Route Army is like a gentle breeze and drizzle, and the people can live again as soon as they come." Due to the correct implementation of the Party's policies, uniting the masses, and practically solving the problems of the masses, not only has it won the support of the broad masses, but it has also played a great role in winning over and disintegrating the enemy and puppets. During this period, 130 puppet village cadres, 930 landlords, rich peasants, and deceived people, 14 Yan bandit engineering personnel, 41 regular soldiers, and 20 local armed personnel were won over and disintegrated from the enemy's side and returned to the village.

　　怀疑变为热爱
  　寿榆群众依靠我党我军
    【北岳讯】寿（阳）榆（次）大部地区曾是阎匪占领区，去年正太战役时，由于我某些干部在执行政策与群众纪律上发生过一些错误，致使不少群众对我党我军发生怀疑。去年八月阎匪重占该区，乘机又向群众进行威胁诱惑，因而有部分群众，特别是地主、富农，逃到太原等敌占地区，今年五月寿阳城再获解放后，领导上特别严格的注意正确执行政策和纠正干部的坏作风，规定了县区干部的行动纪律，反对一切脱离群众的现象，全面的在群众中展开政治宣传和教育工作。经过五十天时间，成绩很大，过去很多群众不敢见我们，现在都依靠我们了。群众普遍反映：“八路军好！不刁不抢，就是一心给咱们办事”。八区张村周三妮说：“八路军是说甚应甚，宽大政策真好。照这样做下去，保管能得了天下”。寿阳城内天主教党八十多岁的牛老教头说：“你们才真是救国救民的。阎锡山真把老百姓快治死了”。张村李正三说：“国正天心顺，官清民自安，二战区（阎匪军）在时，好象是恶风暴雨，打的老百姓头也抬不起来；八路军好象是清风细雨，一来老百姓就能活了”。由于正确执行党的政策，团结群众，实际的解决群众问题，不但得到了广大群众拥护，在争取与瓦解敌伪方面也起了很大作用。这一时期，由敌方争取瓦解回村者，计有伪村干部一百三十名，地主、富农及受骗群众九百三十名，阎匪工务人员十四名，正规军四十一名，地方武装二十名。
