　　【Ji-Lu-Yu Electric】During Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army's disturbance in Henan this time, a soldier named Zhao Chuan'yi from its 200th Brigade, carrying an American-style rifle, a shovel, and over seventy rounds of ammunition, surrendered to the Linze Fourth District Government in our area. That day, the cadres of the Fourth District took him to the county government and, according to the regulations for surrendering with weapons, awarded him 10,000 yuan. Zhao Chuan'yi was very happy and told us a lot about the internal wavering and desertion within the enemy's 5th Army. He said: "Once, the brothers in my 9th Squad asked me: 'Zhao Chuan'yi, what do you think will happen to us if the People's Liberation Army captures us?' You don't know, in the 5th Army, the officers kept saying that the People's Liberation Army doesn't give the captured soldiers of the 5th Army food or drink, and then they execute them. But I told the brothers, 'I asked an old man that time, and he said the People's Liberation Army doesn't kill captives.' One brother said, 'My home is in Dingtao, which is close to home now. I didn't understand before, and I didn't dare to run no matter what.' Another brother from the 7th Squad said, 'The People's Liberation Army is so numerous, if there's a real fight, none of us in the 5th Army will escape being captured. In the Northeast, only a few cities are left, and they are all surrounded by the People's Liberation Army.' After Yanzhou was taken, the news spread everywhere among the common people, and we quickly learned about it. Everyone became restless. The officers knew about it early on and didn't want it to spread downward. The platoon leader secretly told us, 'The company commander doesn't want me to tell the lower ranks.' This made people even more restless. We once captured a new recruit who was originally a soldier in the 5th Army, captured by the People's Liberation Army, and recaptured by us after being released. After being detained for a few days, he was assigned to the squad. The brothers in the squad surrounded him and asked him questions like crazy: 'The People's Liberation Army didn't kill you?' He said, 'The People's Liberation Army not only didn't kill me, they didn't detain me either. They treated me well, and when I wanted to go home, they gave me travel expenses and a note. I was captured again this time, and I was detained for four days and scolded.' Someone else asked him, 'Didn't they say the militia would kill us if they captured us?' He said, 'No one will kill you no matter who captures you. It's no good just listening to the officers. The officers are afraid we'll desert, so they're scaring us.' When those guys heard that, they were happy and said, 'If they really don't kill us, let's run.' They ran away that day. Later, three or five people disappeared every day, and I didn't know when they were gone. They were all influenced by the soldier who had been captured before. Later, he also ran away with his gun. That day, when it was time for dinner, a platoon was missing from a certain company, ha! ha! They had all run away."

　　蒋军五师的逃风
  　记五军投诚士兵的谈话
    【冀鲁豫电】蒋匪第五军这次扰乱河南的时候，其二百旅一个名叫赵传义的士兵，拿着一支美式步枪，和一个铁锹，带着七十多发子弹，到我临泽四区区公所投诚。当天，四区干部就领他到县府，按携械投诚的规定，奖给一万元。赵传义非常高兴，向我们讲了许多敌五军内部动摇逃跑的情形。他说：有一次，我连九班弟兄们问我：“赵传义，你说解放军捉住咱到底怎样呀？”您不知道，在五军那边，当官的不断讲话，说解放军捉住五军的兵不叫吃，不叫喝，后来就枪毙。可是我向弟兄们说：“那次我问了个老百姓，他说解放军捉住不杀。”一个弟兄就说：“我家是定陶的，这会离家可近了，以前不了解，无论如何不敢跑。”另一个七班的弟兄说：“解放军这么多，真要是打，咱五军的兵都脱不了当俘虏。在东北只剩下几个城了，还都叫解放军围着。”兖州打开以后，老百姓到处说这消息，我们很快就知道了。大伙都沉不住气，当官的早知道了，不叫往下传，排长偷偷告诉我们：“连长不叫我对下级说。”这样人们越沉不住气。我们有一回抓来一个新兵，他原来就是个五军士兵，叫解放军俘虏了，放回去又被我们抓来了。押了几天，分到班里，班里弟兄们围住他乱问：“解放军没有杀你呀？”他说：“人家解放军不光不杀我，也没押我，还优待我，愿意回家，给发路费，开条子，我这回又被抓了来，倒押了四天，还挨顿骂。”又有人问他：“人家不是说民兵捉住咱就杀吗？”他说：“任谁捉住也不杀，光听当官的话不中，当官的怕咱开小差，吓唬咱。”那几个一听高兴了，说道：“要是真不杀，咱跑吧”。当天他们就跑啦。后来每天三个五个，不知啥时候就不见了，都是被俘虏过的那兵影响走的。后来，他也带枪跑啦，那天开饭的时候，某连缺了一个排，哈！哈！都跑啦。
