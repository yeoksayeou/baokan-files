Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th—The Yanzhou democratic government has rapidly stabilized social order. Before the annihilation of the enemy troops defending the city, the people suffered greatly from the enemy and puppets' burning, killing, and looting. In the city alone, more than ten thousand houses in Guan, Zhao Village, Huayuan, Xinqiao, Ximen, Nanmen and other places were destroyed by enemy landmines, explosives and arson, leaving thousands of citizens homeless. After liberation, the democratic municipal government immediately allocated 200,000 jin of grain for emergency relief, and discussed with the citizens to solve their difficulties and restore production. The teachers and students of Ziyang Normal School and other schools who were forced by the enemy to build fortifications and were injured, sick, or scattered during the war were immediately taken in and treated by the People's Liberation Army after the war. The schools were also cleaned up and prepared for resumption of classes. The railway workers in the city registered, and 355 people were registered within two days after liberation. Among the freight cars stranded at Yanzhou Station during the war, seven were fully loaded with private merchants' goods. Except for thirteen large boxes of cigarettes and some cotton cloth and cosmetics that were looted by the enemy, the remaining goods were entrusted to the Materials Handling Committee of the East China Finance and Economics Office stationed in Yanzhou to notify the owners to claim them. On the 12th of last month, three merchants from Jinan claimed back butter and porcelain bowls worth 840 million yuan (June prices) in Chiang currency with their bills of lading. More than 300 pieces of cotton, leather, and wool were claimed from goods stored in the post office by 17 businesses from Tianjin and Jining. In addition, among the captured vehicles, 22 were found to be private commercial vehicles seized by the enemy before the war. All of them were returned to their original owners and issued with passes. On the 21st of last month, the car owners jointly formed a car company and started transporting goods to Jining and other places.
