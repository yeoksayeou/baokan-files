Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 9th: The Northwest Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party held a cadre meeting of over a thousand people on "August 1st" to commemorate the 21st anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Comrades He Long, Lin Boqu, Xi Zhongxun, Ma Mingfang, and Wang Weizhou attended. Comrade He Long, who participated in leading the "Nanchang Uprising" 21 years ago, and Comrade Lin Boqu, who served as chairman of the Finance Committee of the Revolutionary Committee at the time, spoke successively, recalling the course of the "Nanchang Uprising" and its great historical significance. They pointed out that during the low tide of the revolution, at every moment of serious difficulty, our party and government cadres and Red Army soldiers were full of high revolutionary enthusiasm and firm revolutionary confidence, never being pessimistic, disappointed, fearful, or surrendering. They insisted on armed struggle, closely united the masses, overcame all difficulties, and finally overcame the difficulties and achieved victorious development. They further pointed out that the revolutionary war situation for the liberation of Northwest China is developing victoriously. In the high tide of the revolution, all cadres in the border region should summon up the greatest courage, lead by example, and display high revolutionary enthusiasm. They should conduct a serious and irreconcilable struggle against sloppy and careless work styles, anarchy or undisciplined states, and ideas of peace and enjoyment. They should enhance ideological awareness, improve work efficiency, strengthen work in the new areas, fully mobilize the power of the masses, overcome all difficulties in development, and strive for the early liberation of the entire Northwest and the victory of all of China. The profound and moving speeches of Comrades He Long and Lin Boqu gave the cadres present great encouragement and inspiration.
