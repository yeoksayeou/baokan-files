　　Lujiakou Branch Secretary Learns from Li Shunda
  　Sets Out Three-Year Plan for Prosperity
    [Taihang News] Guo Shuanglong (Labor Hero), the branch secretary of Lujiakou in Pingshun First District, studied the notice from the Prefectural Committee regarding learning from Li Shunda and Comrade Ti Shui, and recognized the Party's production policy. He also realized that production and prosperity in Pingshun were possible. Therefore, on the night of August 5th, he convened a branch meeting to review the production work of the first half of the year. Everyone felt that it was not done well enough. The main reason was that they did not correctly understand the significance of Party rectification, and cadres did not dare to boldly lead the masses, fearing making mistakes again. The work was not grasped tightly enough. At the same time, they were afraid that holding too many meetings would delay the work of the masses, and some calls and instructions could not be implemented in a timely manner. The masses' thinking of daring to get rich has not been completely clarified, thus affecting this year's agricultural production and not catching up with the third weeding. Guo Shuanglong said: Now that Party rectification and correction of deviations have been carried out, everyone understands. We should lead the masses in production to make up for this loss. Shunda is indeed stronger than us. He implements the Party's policies everywhere, while we sometimes consider personal gains and losses, which affects production. Now it seems that weeding three times is not possible, but we must make up for this loss in manure accumulation, land improvement, plowing wheat fields, and building embankments. He first put forward his own production plan, preparing for a major effort next year. Now we will start accumulating fertilizer, accumulating 1,700 dan (an average of more than 100 dan per mu, last year it was an average of 60 dan per mu). At the same time, he set out a three-year prosperity construction plan. Within three years, he will build three earth cave dwellings, five tile-roofed houses, build a courtyard wall, install a millstone, and build a toilet and a well. The whole family of ten will be able to have new quilts and new clothes. The branch discussed his plan, and everyone felt that it was very specific and practical, and relatively long-term. They immediately called on the masses to learn from him. Many masses held family meetings to study and make plans. Now the branch is leading the masses to check the weeding of the land and plant small plots of vegetable land, and mobilize and organize manure accumulation. (Bai Peilan, Fu Deyi, Qin Baofa)

　　路家口支书学习李顺达
  　订出三年发家计划
    【太行讯】平顺一区路家口支书郭双龙（劳动英雄），学习了地委关于向李顺达、向提水二同志学习的通报，认识了党的生产政策，也认识了生产发家在平顺是有条件的。于是在八月五号夜召开支部会议，检查今年前半年生产工作，大家都感到确实作的不够好。主要原因是由于没有正确认识整党的意义，干部不敢大胆领导群众，怕再犯错误，工作抓的不够紧。同时又怕开会多了群众误工，有些号召及指示不能及时贯彻下去，群众不敢发家的思想还未完全澄清，因此影响今年农业生产没有赶住耨三遍。郭双龙说：现在整党和纠偏都作过了，大家已明白了，我们就应该领导群众生产，弥补这个损失。顺达确实比咱强，人家处处执行党的政策，咱自己有时就考虑个人得失，以至影响了生产。现在看耧三遍是不行了，要在积肥、修地、翻麦地、垒岸上面补救这个损失。他首先提出自己的生产计划，准备明年大干。现在开始积肥，要积一千七百担（每亩平均一百担以上，去年每亩平均六十来担）。他同时订了个三年发家建设计划，在三年内要打土窑三孔，盖瓦房五间，垒起院墙，按碾一盘，打修厕所一个，水井一眼。全家人十口，要作到盖新被、穿新衣。支部讨论了他的计划，大家都觉着很具体实在，又比较长期。即在群众中号召向他学习。许多群众都召开了家庭会议，研究订计划。现在支部正领导群众检查耨地及种小块菜地，并动员组织积肥。（白培兰、傅德义、秦保发）
