　　Pingxi Local Post Office
  　Overcomes Difficulties to Support Military Postal Service
    [North Yue News] During the Ping-Bao front offensive in mid-July, the Pingxi Local Post Office enthusiastically supported the military postal service. The Zhaizhai, Fangshan, and Liangxiang post offices dispatched nine mobile messengers, establishing three temporary postal routes, totaling 220 li (of which 55 li were night shifts). Generally, they maintained the swift and timely delivery of military mail. Comrade Liu Fuhai, the head of the military post office, said: "You have given us great assistance."
    On July 13th, at 6:00 PM, the first batch of military mail arrived in Liangxiang. The messenger comrades delivered it to the military post office that same night (a distance of 20 li). Later, when the military post office moved, the Liangxiang Post Office immediately established a night postal route stretching 50 li, directly connecting to the military post office. On one occasion, it rained heavily at night, and everyone estimated that this route would inevitably be blocked by the rain. However, two messenger comrades from the Liangxiang Post Office disregarded all difficulties, braved the heavy rain, and climbed over the mountains along the rarely-traveled sheep trails, arriving at the military post office on time. Comrade Yang Wencheng of the Zhaizhai Post Office set off on a rainy evening, carrying documents weighing 20 jin on his back. Halfway there, he learned that the military post office had moved. He flexibly gathered information, walked half the night, and finally completed his task the next day. Later, due to changes in the enemy situation, the route from Liangxiang to the military post office was cut off. In order to quickly establish a new route, Comrades Niu Sumin and Wang Chaowen from the branch office, along with a third comrade, braved the heavy rain overnight, climbed over a high mountain that was over 10 li uphill and 8 li downhill. After midnight, they found a small mountain village, rested for two or three hours, and continued to trek through the rain for fifty or sixty li with twenty or thirty jin of documents on their backs, finally establishing a route that was 120 li long. When the Fangshan Post Office had not yet established contact with the military post office, military mail was sent to Fangshan. In order to deliver it promptly, Comrade Zhao Jianghai was dispatched to find them. Comrade Zhao, under the strafing of four enemy aircraft and enemy artillery fire, searched everywhere and finally completed the task. Director Jin of the Fangshan Post Office and Director Huang of the Liangxiang Post Office both took the initiative to personally go to places fifty or sixty li away to discuss contact methods and inspect routes with the military post office.

　　平西地方邮局
  　不辞艰苦支援军邮
    【北岳讯】平西地方邮局在七月中旬的平保前线攻势作战中，热烈支援军邮。斋堂、房山、良乡等邮局抽调九个机动交通员，设立三条临时邮线，长达二二○里（其中夜班五五里），一般的保持了军邮文件的迅速及时，军邮局长刘福海同志说：“你们给了我们很大援助”。
    七月十三日下午六时，军邮文件第一次发到良乡，交通员同志们当晚就给军邮局送去了（距二十里）。后来军邮局移动了，良乡局立即设立了一条长达五十里的夜班邮线，直通军邮。有一次夜间下着大雨，大家估计这条线非被雨阻断不可，但良乡局的两个交通员同志，却不顾一切困难，冒着大雨，沿着很少行人的羊肠山道，爬过大山，按时到达了军邮局。斋堂局杨文成同志于一个雨天的傍晚出发，背着重达廿斤的文件，走到半路，得悉军邮局转移了，他机动的了解了情况，走了半夜，第二天终于完成了任务。后来因敌情变化良乡通军邮的线路被切断了，为了迅速设立新的线路，分局牛苏民、王朝文等三个同志，连夜冒着大雨，爬过一上十里下八里的高山，半夜以后，才找到一个小山村，休息二、三点钟，继续背着二、三十斤的文件在雨中跋涉五六十里，终于把长达一二○里的路线建立起来。当房山局还未与军邮局取得联系时，军邮文件就发到房山了，为了及时送到，派赵江海同志去找，赵同志在四架敌机扫射及敌炮轰击下，四处寻找，最后完成了任务。房山局靳局长，良乡黄局长，均主动的亲自到五六十里以外的地方，找军邮局商谈联络办法及检查路线。（曹双禄）
