Transformation of a Printing Bureau
    Yang Shi
    Fluctuations
    A public-owned printing bureau in North China, moved from Zhangjiakou to the countryside, has a total of 598 employees. Through the Party's education since March of last year, the political consciousness of the workers has gradually increased. During the New Year's support for the army this year, they contributed over ten million yuan at once. A worker's family member even donated her gold ring, saying, "We were afraid of unemployment and starvation in the KMT-controlled areas in the past, so we saved this ring. Now that our lives are guaranteed, let's donate it." The hard lives of the factory cadres have influenced many workers to voluntarily propose salary reductions. They said, "People have been in the revolution for over a dozen years, and they are still working hard. For whom?" Although this consciousness is not widespread, the overall awareness of the working class is increasing daily.
    During the study of Chairman Mao's report and the "February 7th" editorial in February and March, when the discussion formally addressed reducing wages and increasing working hours, the workers' ideological problems were centrally exposed. The workers of the Second Branch even experienced serious ideological fluctuations. Many workers grumbled, "What's the point of studying? Isn't it just to reduce wages?" Some openly disagreed: "This policy can be implemented after the liberation of all of China, but it's not appropriate now. Wages should be higher when we first enter the city. If they're not high, it won't show that the workers are liberated." "If peasants transfer from the countryside to the factory and the wages are lower, who will come?" "It was right that the wages were high in Zhangjiakou. We wouldn't have come out if they weren't high." "If wages are reduced, the purchasing power of the workers will be small, and industrial and commercial development will not be possible." "The wage in rice coupons cannot buy the original amount of rice at the cooperative. The price of rice doesn't keep up with the rising prices of other goods, so the rice is reduced invisibly." Apprentices said, "One hundred and ten catties is not enough. Just eating will take one hundred catties. If working hours are longer in the future, we'll eat even more. How can we bring money back home? What if we get sick? What about getting married and having children?" Some also felt that workers were not masters because of the strict labor discipline and the inability to take leave freely. All kinds of dissatisfaction were revealed. Under these circumstances, few people could openly express different opinions. Someone said, "Three hundred catties is also about right," but retracted it the next day. Many people brought up some life problems to "beat around the bush," delaying it month after month.
    Many cadres also had problems they couldn't figure out: "Is increased production based on political consciousness or economic incentives?" "Enterprise management is not as good as the supply system. The rice earned is less, and the political status is not as glorious as the supply system." "Were we too left in the past? Are we too right now?" Some were afraid that the increase in working hours, reduction in wages, and the change to the new scale would be too much for the workers, so they held onto the attitude of fighting for a little more from the public. Others stood by and watched: "The policy is the business of the higher-ups. We'll do whatever we're told." Or they didn't speak to avoid criticism, didn't explain the workers' opinions, and only reported them to the higher-ups.
    Transformation
    In mid-March, the Party committee comrades went to the bureau to understand the learning situation and proposed two key solutions to the problems: (1) Conduct a thorough investigation into the lives of apprentices and technicians, investigate the wage standards of neighboring factories, and investigate the lives of farmers in the village. Educate cadres and workers with practical life materials, first solving the ideological problems of Party members and cadres. Cadres should first study the policies and conduct self-criticism within the Party. Because the cadres themselves didn't understand many of the questions raised by the workers, the branch committees felt it was urgent to study the policies. The branch committee members also participated during the leaders' in-depth investigation. Mu Qibin, the secretary of the Second Branch, investigated an apprentice who had come to the factory with nothing last year. He earned 140 catties of rice per month. After spending about 100 catties on food, he had newly acquired cotton clothes, quilts, bed sheets, shoes, socks, and daily necessities. In ten months, he had also sent 34,000 yuan home. Reducing wages a little would not be a problem. Some cadres began to change their thinking when faced with these practical materials. (2) Emphasize policy learning; the general branch committee should specifically resolve the workers' doubts and confused ideas; and cooperate with the administration to solve practical difficulties in the workers' lives and work.
    In early April, the general branch committee convened all the employees of the bureau, explained everyone's doubts, arranged for self-criticism of the previous stage of learning, and continued to adopt the method of saying everything to study and discuss the documents with each other. Responsible cadres from the Party, government, and labor union all participated in the Party's small groups and study group meetings to specifically explain the policies. In the meantime, bureau affairs meetings, activist meetings, and joint meetings of the Party, government, and labor union were held based on the changes in the employees' thinking to solve various specific problems in learning, life, and work. During this period, the cadres' thinking gradually cleared up, and their learning improved a step further. Some employees were already planning to reduce wages and began to conduct self-criticism: "In the past, we didn't pay attention to policy learning and didn't understand that wages should be determined by the value of labor. We were only circling around improving our personal lives." "Our wages are high now and should be re-evaluated." Some workers in the repair department said, "Reducing wages is not a problem. It's just that we don't have much education and don't understand the policies. Let's have more classes in the future." Apprentices in the finishing department requested that new wages be evaluated quickly (their wages had been reduced last year). However, a large portion of the workers, seeing that the wages of the newspaper workers were between 120 and 200 catties, suspected that their own wages would be reduced to who knows what level. Later, the administration announced the standards, and everyone knew the bottom line, so they were more at ease. But there were still some individuals who said, "Wu Dalang taking medicine, we have to take it whether we want to or not." "Inside and out, it's two and a half catties." Then someone retorted, "We are reducing wages because what we create by our labor is not worth that much. Reducing them doesn't mean you won't have enough to eat. Liu Shanzhi is sick, and isn't his family of four or five people taken care of by the public? (This is about worker relief)" Some technicians said, "In the past, we earned 500 or 600 catties, but we didn't plan our spending and wasted it. In the future, we'll earn 320 catties and have a plan (he has already made precise calculations), and we can still have a surplus." Some began to think from a long-term perspective, saying, "If the wages in private factories are too high, the capitalists won't open them. If the wages in public-owned factories are too high, and the value of labor is not enough, then the farmers will have to bear the burden, which is unreasonable. The current policy is correct." Several comrades in the sand casting group said, "In the past, we just wanted to earn millet, buy a few acres of land, and build a few houses. Now we understand." Hu Gui said, "Last time I burned the quilt, I complained. Compared to Comrade Lin Xiangqian, I'm really far behind! Now I don't have any opinion on how much I'm paid. I guarantee that my work won't be passive." This marked that the consciousness of the working class had gradually increased.
    When discussing the issue of private factories, some workers initially couldn't understand it, saying, "We allow capitalists to develop and protect them. What if they become the Four Big Families in the future?" After repeated discussions, everyone gradually understood. Someone said, "Under the leadership of the democratic government, their exploitation is limited to a certain extent." Someone said, "After the liberation of Zhangjiakou, a flour mill proposed to workers to share in the company because it could not afford to pay wages. The result was that the workers were not strong enough, so it closed down, and the workers lost their jobs."
    Solving Practical Problems
    After the initial clearing of thoughts, practical problems such as food, cooperatives, family members, leave, and borrowing money had to be solved. Especially food. If it was not managed well, there would be a lot of waste, and it would be difficult for the apprentices to maintain their lives after their wages were reduced; the technicians who had families would have large expenses, and if there was waste, their lives would be greatly affected. The printing department's big kitchen had 102 people, who ate together and shared the costs equally, using four cooks. They had fine grains eight times a month, and the rest of the time they ate coarse grains. In February, each person spent 116 catties of rice. In March, it was 99 catties. After paying attention to improving management, each person needed only 78 catties in April. The standard was not lowered, and the food was more palatable. The main reason was that the enthusiasm of the cooks and administrators was improved through education. They proactively sprouted soybeans, raised pigs, rodent-proofed the granary, bought vegetables from far away, modified the winnowing machine, and saved coal (at the same price of 300 yuan per catty, the coal expenses in March were 126,000, which was sharply reduced to 47,000 in April), and an incentive system was implemented for the cooks. The coal stoves in the finishing department cost each person 110 catties of rice in February. In March, the meal system was contracted, costing each person 80 catties. In April, it was changed to a meal-selling system, with each person buying their own food, which greatly reduced waste. Each person used a maximum of 80 catties, a minimum of 50 catties, and an average of 60 catties.
    Solving the family member issue mainly involved organizing them to produce things: rolling cigarettes, spinning thread, making shoes, etc. A cigarette factory was attached to the bureau, and eleven female family members participated in April. One of them earned 30,000 yuan, two each earned 25,000, and most of the others each earned 18,000. At the then market price, they could buy a hundred catties of rice. They also planned to organize mutual assistance in taking care of children and taking turns working. Some were learning to knit socks.
    Some time ago, the workers were dissatisfied with the cooperative. They received the rice coupons but couldn't guarantee that they could buy the same amount of rice and the daily necessities they should have received from the cooperative. The prices of some items were even higher than those on the market, and some scales for selling flour were not accurate. After learning and rectification, the responsible comrades of the cooperative made a self-criticism to the workers, guaranteeing to correct the shortcomings and ensuring that they would regularly supply the workers with necessary production goods and that the prices would be as little affected by the outside world as possible. They accumulated workers' idle funds and organized family members to produce, and on this basis, they generated profits.
    Regarding the issue of borrowing money, it was decided to hand over 2.5% of the wages to the labor union as a welfare fund to solve the workers' difficulties, and the administration would no longer lend money. Regarding the issue of leave, it was decided that being away on public business or major events such as weddings and funerals would be considered public leave within the approved period; being sick would be considered sick leave; and the rest would be considered private leave, generally once a year, for a total of one week.
    Achievements Since May 1st
    The initial clearing of thoughts and the solution of specific problems led to a significant and tremendous transformation of the entire printing bureau since May 1st. At the May 1st commemoration meeting, many workers publicly reviewed their shortcomings in their past study and work, comparing the past pain with today's happiness, challenging each other, and guaranteeing to work hard and not cause trouble. Small groups also launched competitions with each other: guaranteeing not to waste materials, spending less or not spending money, and saving to support the front; guaranteeing that work would continue as usual after the wage reduction and that no ideological problems would arise; doing what they said or doing the same thing; obeying the leadership of the Party and the government, etc. A small number of people were still unwilling to reduce their wages ideologically, but they were also pushed up by the mass wave. Zou Mingfa, the head of the technician team, had not had his wages reduced several times before, and he was unhappy as soon as he heard about the wage reduction. Even though his daughter Zou Xiulan (an apprentice) voluntarily reduced her wages, he was still unhappy. This time, when everyone challenged each other, his daughter said to him unhappily, "Everyone else is challenging each other. I wanted to challenge you but didn't dare to, because I was afraid you wouldn't do a good job." He was greatly stimulated by this and said publicly that his child was so advanced, and he was so bad. He would definitely work hard in the future and guarantee that the quantity and quality of printing would be improved. After that, there was a significant change. Ding Bingliang, a technician leader in his fifties, had also had his wages reduced somewhat last year, but they were still very high. This time, he said excitedly, "The anti-Japanese cadres suffered for so many years. We can't earn wages higher than the value of our labor and enjoy ourselves by earning hundreds of catties of rice a month! In the future, I won't do anything else. I'll change a four-tael glass of wine into two taels, spend less money, and the wage reduction will be enough. I have to overcome my past mistakes and teach the apprentices well and do my job well. I'll be considered to have made a contribution." Liu Yongfa, a technician in the repair department, recalled the pain of being unemployed and wandering around in the past, of not having enough to eat when he worked as an ironworker in Zhangjiakou and not being allowed to say anything, which forced him to steal. He was moved by the fact that the Eighth Route Army distributed rice and flour to relieve the workers after the liberation of Zhangjiakou and said, "I will never forget the Eighth Route Army and Chairman Mao until I die. Now I have food, clothing, and shelter wherever I go. I'm not afraid of unemployment. It's enough if the reduced wage is enough to eat." He had previously voluntarily donated 50,000 yuan of his savings to support the front, and this time he wanted to donate another 50,000. The labor union was afraid that it would affect his life, so they went to talk to him. He said, "As long as Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown, future generations will no longer be exploited. Future generations will know that it was the old generation that brought about the revolution." He has now trained an apprentice to make machine parts. Ma Xunliang, a skilled printing worker, used to often fight, not study, and pick quarrels and cause trouble at work. During this study, he recalled the situation of being hungry and suffering when he worked as a cart puller in the KMT area. His work became active, and he no longer picked quarrels and fought. He was also able to actively oppose incorrect ideas in the discussion meeting. Regarding the wage reduction, he calculated and said, "If 415 catties is reduced to 260 catties, we can just waste less. If we endure some hardship, we can overthrow Chiang Kai-shek quickly!"
    On the basis of the general improvement of the workers' work enthusiasm, the departments used the "three postings" method to democratically evaluate wages in groups. Based on technical level and labor efficiency, they were divided into four levels: apprentices 110 catties to 160 catties, ordinary workers 160 catties to 220 catties, skilled workers 220 catties to 270 catties, and technical workers 270 catties to 330 catties. From then on, the unreasonable phenomenon that still existed after the two wage reductions in the past year was solved, and everyone received an appropriate wage.
    Compared with a year ago, the overall production efficiency of the bureau has increased by 20%, and the waste rate has decreased by 23%. But they are not satisfied with this: some departments, sections, teams, and small groups are formulating more specific production plans, preparing to continue to carry out labor competitions with greater efficiency, and further improve various systems, such as methods for rewarding labor, so that the quantity and quality of production will be further improved.

　　一个印刷局的转变
    杨时
    波动
    华北某公营印刷局，是从张家口移到农村来的，共有职工五百九十八人。职工们经过去年三月以来党的教育，政治觉悟逐渐提高。今年新年劳军，曾一次献出一千万余元。一个工人家属把她的金戒指也献了出来，说：“过去在蒋管区失业挨饿怕了，积蓄了戒指，现在生活有了保障，把它献出来吧。”工厂干部生活艰苦，影响不少工人自动提出减资。他们说：“人家革命十几年了，现在还是吃苦耐劳，为谁呢？”这种自觉虽不是很普遍，但全体工人阶级觉悟均日在提高中。
    今年二三月间学习毛主席报告与“二七”社论，正式讨论到减低工资、增加工时，工人思想上的问题集中地暴露出来了。二支的职工更形成了严重的思想波动。许多工人发牢骚说：“学不学，还不是减工资？”有的正面表示不同意：“这个政策，解放全中国以后可以实行，现在不合适。才进城工资应该高些，不高显不出工人是解放。”“农民从农村转到工厂里，工资少了，谁还来呢？”“张家口工资高是对的。不高我们就出不来。”“减了工资，工人购买力小了，工商业不能发展。”“工资米价到合作社买不了原数的米，米价赶不上别的物价上涨快，无形中就减少了米。”学工说：“一百一十斤不够，光吃就得一百斤。以后工时长了吃的更多，回家带不回去钱怎办？生了病怎办？娶媳妇、生小孩怎办？”还有些人因为严饬劳动纪律不能自由请假，就认为工人没当了主人。一切不满都露出来了。在这种情形下，很少有人能正面提出不同意见。有一个人说了一句“三百斤也差不多”，第二天就收回不算了。许多人把一些生活问题提出来“泡蘑菇”，拖延一月算一月。
    不少干部中同样存在着想不通的问题：“增加生产是靠政治觉悟呢？还是靠经济刺激呢？”“企业化不如供给制，赚的米又少，政治地位也不如供给制光荣。”“过去左了，现在是不是又右了？”有的怕增加工时、减少工资与改新秤一齐来，工人受不了，抱着向公家争一点算一点的态度；有的是袖手旁观：“政策是上面的事，叫怎办就怎办。”或为避免批评而不说话，对工人意见不做解释，只向上反映。
    转变
    三月中旬，党委同志到该局了解学习情况，提出解决问题的两个关键：（一）切实调查学工与技工的生活，调查友邻工厂的工资标准，调查驻村农民生活，用实际生活材料教育干部与工人，首先是解决党员与干部的思想问题。干部先学习政策，在党内展开检讨批评。因为工人提出的许多问题自己也不懂，支委们都感到学习政策很迫切。在领导同志深入调查期间，支委们也参加了。二支书记穆其彬同志调查了一个学工，是去年光身到厂里的。月赚米一百四十斤，除支出百斤左右伙食费外，棉衣、被子、被单、鞋袜、日用品，都是新置的。十个月中，还捎回家三万四千元。工资减低一些，不成什么问题。有些干部面对这些实际材料，思想也开始有了转变。（二）强调政策学习；总支委要具体解决工人的疑问与糊涂观念；并配合行政，解决工人生活上与工作上的实际困难。
    四月初，总支委召集全局职工，把大家的疑问做了解释，布置检讨上一段学习，仍采取有甚说甚的办法，互相研究，讨论文件。党政工负责干部都参加党的小组与学习小组会议，具体解释政策。中间又根据职工思想变化情况召开局务会，活动分子会，党政工联席会等，解决学习与生活、工作中各种具体问题。这一时期干部思想逐渐打通，学习提高了一步。职工方面有些人已在打算着减工资，并开始进行自我检讨：“以前没注重政策学习，没有了解到工资应该拿劳动价值来决定，光为提高个人生活兜圈子；”“现在工资是高，应当估价。”修理部有的工人说：“减工资没什么问题了，就是文化低，政策不了解，以后多上些课吧。”完成部学工们要求赶快评新工资（他们工资去年就减低了）。但是还有一大部分工人，看到报社工人工资成了一百二十斤至二百斤，就怀疑自己工资不知要降到什么地步。以后行政上宣布了标准，大家摸了底，就比较安心了。但还有个别人说：“武大郎吃药，吃也得吃，不吃也得吃。”“里外算二斤半。”接着就有人反驳：“咱们减低工资是因为自己劳动所创造的不值那么多，减了以后也不是叫你吃不饱。刘善芝病了，他家四五口人还不是公家管吗？（这是工人救济问题）”有的技工说：“过去赚五、六百斤，花时没计划，有浪费。以后赚三百二十斤，有了计划（他已做了精确计算），还可有剩余”。有人开始从远大处考虑，说：“私人工厂工资高了，资本家就不开办；公营工厂工资高了，劳动价值不够，就得农民负担，这就不合理。现在政策是正确的。”翻砂组几个同志说：“过去就是为了赚小米，买几亩地，盖几间房，现在弄清了。”胡贵说：“上次烧了被子我还讲怪话，和林祥谦同志比起来真差的远！现在给我多少工资也没意见，保证工作不消极。”这标志着工人阶级觉悟已逐渐提高。
    讨论到私营工厂问题，开始有些工人总是搞不通，说：“咱们允许资本家发展，还保护他们，将来成了四大家族怎办哩？”经过反复讨论，大家也逐渐想通了。有人说：“在民主政府领导下，他们剥削是有一定限度的。”有人说：“张家口解放后，有一个粉坊因为工资太高，坊主开不起，提出和工人一同结股，结果工人没力量，关了门，工人失了业。”
    解决实际问题
    初步打通了思想，伙食、合作社、家属、请假、借款等实际问题就要解决了。特别是伙食，如果管理不好，浪费很大，学工们减了资就很难维持；技工们带着家属，花费很大，如有浪费，生活也要大受影响。印刷部大伙房一百零二人，合伙吃饭，按人摊股，使用四个伙夫，每月八顿细粮，其余吃粗粮，二月份每人开支米一一六斤，三月份九九斤，注意改进管理后，四月份每人七十八斤就够了，标准并没降低，饭食反而调剂得顺口了。其原因，主要是教育提高伙夫与管理员的积极性，主动生豆芽、喂猪、粮库防鼠、远路买菜、改造风斗、节省煤炭（同是三百元一斤，三月份支炭钱十二万六，四月份骤减至四万七），并对伙夫实行了奖励制度。完成部的煤灶，二月份每人开支米一百一十斤，三月份实行包饭，每人开支八十斤。四月份改为卖饭制，各人买着吃，浪费更大大减少，每人最高八十斤，最低五十斤，平均吃六十斤。
    解决家属问题主要是组织起来生产——卷烟、纺线、做鞋等。局内附设了一个烟厂，四月份有十一个女家属参加。其中有一个赚了三万元，有两个各赚二万五，其余大部各赚一万八。按当时市价能买米百斤。她们并计划组织互助看孩子，轮流上工，有的在学习织袜。
    前些时工人对合作社不满，领了米价不能保证从合作社买得同量米和应得的日用品。有些东西的价格甚至高于市上，有的卖面秤不够。学习整顿后，合作社负责同志向工人做了检讨，保证改正缺点，确定经常供给职工生产必需品，物价尽可能不受外界影响。集积工人游资，组织家属生产，在这基础上生利。
    借钱问题，决定以相当于工资数的百分之二点五交工会作为福利金，解决职工困难，行政上不再出借。请假问题，决定因公外出或婚丧大事，在准假期内为公假；因病为病假；其余为私假，一般的一年一次，共一礼拜。
    五一以来的成绩
    思想上的初步打通与具体问题的解决，使整个印刷局在五一以来起了显著的巨大转变。在纪念五一大会上，有不少工人当众检讨自己过去学习与工作中的缺点，以过去的痛苦和今天的幸福对比，互相挑战，保证努力工作，不闹毛病。小组与小组也展开竞赛：保证不浪费材料，少零花或不零花，节约支援前线；保证减资后工作照常，不闹思想病；说的或做的一样；服从党政领导等。有少数人思想上仍不愿减资，但也被群众性的大浪推上来了。技工长邹明法，以前几次减资都没减，一听说减资就不高兴，至今每月工资仍是八百零一斤米。他女儿邹秀兰（学工）自动减资他还不高兴。这次大家挑战竞赛，他女儿很不高兴的对他说：“人家都挑战，我想挑不敢挑，挑了怕你干不好。”他一下受了很大刺激，公开对人说，孩子这样进步，自己这样不好，以后一定要好好干，保证印刷的数量质量都要提高。这以后就有了显著转变。一个五十多岁的技工长丁秉亮，去年也减过些资，但现在仍然很高。这次他激动的说：“人家抗日干部受了多少年苦，咱不能赚比自己劳动价值更高的工资，一月赚上几百斤米享福！以后不用别的，把一顿饭四两酒改成二两，少零花些，减资就够了。过去的不对我要克服，把学工教好，工作作好，我就算立了功。”修理部技工刘永发追忆过去失业流浪，在张家口当铁工不够吃还不准说，以致被迫偷东西的痛苦和张家口解放后八路军发米发面救济工人的事实，感动的说：“至死忘不了八路军毛主席。现在走到哪里都有吃有穿有住，不怕失业，工资减得够吃了就行。”他过去曾自献积蓄五万元支援前线，这次又要献五万。工会怕影响他的生活，找他去谈，他说：“只要打倒蒋介石，后辈子孙就再不受剥削了。子孙们以后回想起来也知道是老前辈革命得来的。”他现在已经教好了一个打机器零件的学工。印刷熟练工人马训良过去常打架，不学习，工作上挑皮捣蛋；这次学习中追忆了过去在蒋区做工拉车时挨饿受罪的情境，工作变得积极了，也不挑皮打架了，在讨论会上也能积极反对不正确的思想。对减资，他计算了一下说：“四百一十五斤减到二百六十斤，少浪费点就行了。艰苦些，赶快打倒蒋介石！”
    在职工工作积极性普遍提高的基础上，各部门用三榜定案的办法分组民主评定工资。依据技术水平与劳动效率，共分了四等：学工一百一十斤到一百六十斤，普通工人一百六十斤到二百二十斤，熟练工人二百二十斤到二百七十斤，技术工人二百七十斤到三百三十斤。从此解决了过去一年来两次减资后仍然存在的不合理的现象，每人都得到适当工资。
    与一年前比较，现在全局生产效率提高百分之二十，作废率减少百分之二十三。但他们并不满足于此：有的部、科、班和小组正在订定更具体的生产计划，准备继续开展效率更大的劳动竞赛，更加健全各种制度，如奖励劳动的办法等，使生产的数量质量更加提高。
