　　Conscientiously Teaching Students to Read and Write
  　Effective Education at Suizhuang Primary School
    [Taihang News] Suizhuang Primary School in the First District of Huguan County previously emphasized a one-sided poverty and hired peasant line in class education, leading to chaos in the school. Children came to school only to play, parents were dissatisfied, and the school nearly collapsed. On July 2nd, a teachers' conference was held throughout the district to examine the "leftist" deviations in past educational work and discuss ways to implement the new educational guidelines. After the meeting, comrades Ping Dingguo and Zhang Guangyi went to Suizhuang to serve as teachers. After arriving in the village, the two comrades first familiarized themselves with the village's situation. This was an experimental village for Party rectification and replenishment, and the cadres and masses still had some concerns in their thinking. Moreover, it was the busy season for summer harvesting and weeding, and the masses didn't even have time for meetings. Older children were helping with production in the fields, while younger children were playing in the village. After understanding this preliminary situation, they conducted door-to-door visits to further understand the reasons why the school had not been run well in the past. Among the village's 123 school-age children, most parents said they couldn't attend school, saying, "No, we're busy these days!" At this time, only about 20 children, mostly younger ones, were able to come to school. The two comrades were not pessimistic; they continued to patiently and correctly publicize the new educational guidelines and took the time to convene a parents' meeting. The parents suggested that due to the current difficulties, the children should go to school after they were done being busy for a few days. They also reviewed the shortcomings of the school in the past, raising many opinions, such as the school only doing Yangko dances and fast-clapping storytelling, etc. The teachers told the parents that as long as students came to school in the future, they would guarantee that the students would achieve results. However, the parents were still skeptical of the school. At this time, comrades Ping and Zhang were determined to run the school well first. While continuing to publicize the new educational guidelines and mobilizing students, they focused on finding leaders among the children. As a result, in three days, they mobilized more than 60 students to come to school. Because the grade levels were uneven, they first conducted a major examination, and based on the results, reorganized the school organization, reorganized the grades, and officially started classes. Students reported that they were only reciting books and not writing calligraphy, that there was no paper for writing calligraphy, and that their families wouldn't provide money. The teachers conducted another investigation and found that it wasn't that they wouldn't provide money, but that they were afraid of wasting paper and not learning to write. Comrades Ping and Zhang bought five reams of discarded paper, two packages of writing brushes, and two packages of ink from the cultural cooperative and ordered large and small practice books for the children, and they began to write calligraphy on time. Soon, the village held an opera performance, and teachers and children from nearby villages came to watch the opera. Comrades Ping and Zhang first explained the importance of culture to the children and let them discuss the time for watching the opera themselves. The result was a decision to study in the early morning, morning, and afternoon, and watch the opera in the late afternoon and evening. They took the children to class in the wild jujube forest to avoid being affected by the opera. Nearby villagers and opera-goers said, "Suizhuang is performing opera, but the children are still reading books under the jujube trees! This school is different from the past." Comrades Ping and Zhang didn't sleep at noon and slept little at night. The children also promptly went home to report their achievements, saying, "Teacher Ping and Teacher Zhang are good; we can read books and learn to write, which is better than in the past." The children's achievements enlightened the parents' thinking. They not only bought paper for the children but also reimbursed the teachers for their paper and brushes. Parent Wu Jinyu excitedly said, "They really can read now! In a very short time, the students have changed. They want to write and read every day, and the children rush to school after finishing their meals." He bought fifty sheets of paper for his child, saying, "I want my child to read all the time and not delay his studies; I don't need him to help with production." He voluntarily promoted the school's achievements. Except for fourteen school dropouts, all 109 children in the village were enrolled in school and were quite secure in their attendance. Many parents reported that the previous claim that the children were too busy with production was an excuse. In reality, they couldn't learn to write in the past. If it were all like these days, they would be afraid it wasn't enough; they really can read now! The parents sent all the money for paper, brushes, and ink to the school and said many words of gratitude. The school has a new atmosphere.

　　认真教学生念书识字
  　睢庄小学教育有力
    【太行讯】壶关一区睢庄小学，去年强调片面的贫雇路线阶级教育，学校中形成混乱现象。儿童到校只是玩耍，家长不满意，学校垮了台。七月二号召开全区教员会议，检查了过去教育工作中左的偏向，又讨论了贯彻新教育方针的办法。会后平定国、张广义两同志就到睢庄担任教员。两同志到村后，首先了解该村情况。这是个整党填补实验村，干部群众在思想上都还有些顾虑，又在夏收锄苗的农忙季节，群众连开会的时间也没有。大儿童在地里帮助生产，小儿童都是在村上戏玩。他们了解了这个初步情况，又进行逐户访问，继续了解过去学校办不好的原因。该村学龄儿童共一百廿三个，大部家长说不能上学。并说：“不行，忙忙这几天吧！”这时能到校的儿童不过廿余名，都是小儿童。两个同志并不悲观，仍旧耐心正确的宣传新教育方针，又抽时间召开了家长会议，家长们提议说：当前困难，忙几天再叫儿童上学吧。他们并将过去学校的缺点加以检讨。提了许多意见。如过去学校只是扭秧歌、说快板等等。教员向家长说：今后只要学生到校，保证学生有成绩。但在家长的思想上，还是对学校不相信的。这时平、张两同志就下定决心，先把学校办好。一面继续宣传新教育方针，动员学生，一面有重点的在儿童中找领袖。结果三天时间，动员到校六十余名。因年级程度不平衡，先进行一次大考试，根据考试结果，重新整理了学校组织，整编了年级，正式上课。学生反映说：我是光念书不写仿，写仿没有纸，家中不出钱。教员又作调查，发现不是不出钱，是怕浪费了纸识不上字。平、张两同志就在文化社买来流纸五刀、笔两包、墨两包给儿童订了大小揩本，按时写起字来。在不久该村唱戏，附近村庄教员儿童都来看戏，平、张两同志先给儿童讲明文化重要，让儿童自己讨论看戏时间，结果决定清早、上午、下午学习，后半午黑夜看戏。他们带着儿童在野外枣树林下上课，以免受唱戏影响。附近村庄、看戏群众说：睢庄唱戏，儿童还在枣树下念书哩！这学校和过去可不一样啦。平、张两同志午不睡、夜少眠，儿童们也及时回家交代成绩，并反映说：平老师与张老师可行，能念上书识上字，比过去强啦。儿童们的成绩启发了家长的思想，不但给儿童买纸，而且还了先生的纸笔。家长吴金鱼兴奋的说：“这该不是能念书哩，在很短的时间学生倒不一样啦，天天要写字念书，孩子们回家赶着吃完饭就往学校跑哩。”他给孩子买了五十张纸，说：“我要叫俺孩一时也不误了念书，不用他生产啦。”他自动宣传学校成绩，村里除十四个失学儿童外，一百零九个儿童全部入学，都相当巩固。很多家长反映说：以前说孩子们生产忙啦，那是个借口。实际是过去识不上字，要都象这几天还怕不行，该不是能念上书哩！家长们把纸笔墨钱全部送到学校。并说了许多感激话。学校有了新气象啦。
