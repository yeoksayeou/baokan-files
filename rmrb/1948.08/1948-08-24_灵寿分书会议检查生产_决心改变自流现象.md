[Beiyue News] The Lingshou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a joint meeting of all branch committee secretaries in early August to review the county's production situation in the previous period and to study how to strengthen the county's production leadership in the future. The Fifth District Branch Committee, in reviewing production in its district, stated: "The District Committee does not clearly recognize that production work is the central task at present. In the use of cadres, those leading production account for only one-quarter of all cadres. In issuing grain and loan, it failed to organize the masses well and use it to solve difficulties in production. Some loans were not checked after being issued, and some people even used water conservancy loans to buy coal and store goods, using them as capital for private speculative business. Production suffered great losses as a result." The Third District Branch Committee did not tightly grasp the leadership of production, causing production to fall into spontaneous development. Apart from the industrial sector, which was more concerned with production work, other departments did not pay much attention. Villagers from He Dong, Chengjiazhuang, Huo Ying, and other villages spontaneously went to factories to make bedding and sew shoe soles, but the district has not yet organized and led them. The Fourth District Branch Committee checked the livestock loans issued and found that less than half of the borrowers actually bought livestock. Based on the review results and repeated discussions, everyone realized that they had failed to implement the spirit of the "Current Tasks of the North China Liberated Area" and "Further Improve Agricultural Production in the Liberated Area," and had not properly led production, causing the county's production to fall into spontaneous development, which caused great losses to the masses. Everyone decided that in the future, they would concentrate their efforts on leading production, "strengthen the mass viewpoint in leading production, and improve the county's production step by step." Based on the reports and inspections from various districts and the results of the general meeting's discussions, the County Committee proposed that leading production should focus on planting vegetables, hoeing, weeding, checking and eliminating wasteland, and preparing for wheat planting as the main tasks at present, and pay attention to pressing green manure. Check the grain loans to ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose, recovered in a timely manner, and loaned out on a revolving basis, so that the loans can flow continuously and play a greater role. At the same time, widely organize mass sideline production and use all possible opportunities to increase the wealth of the masses. The eastern half of the Fourth and Fifth Districts are plains, and the masses can be organized to repair the weaving sheds and looms that were washed away and damaged by rain, and to organize and develop the textile movement. Most of the women in the First, Second, and Third Districts do not know how to spin and weave, but they can be organized to make bedding and sew shoe soles for the supply departments and factories. In terms of leadership, the County Committee specifically instructed to overcome the floating style of work, and to go to each place and practically understand the situation and help the masses solve specific problems in production. In the past, promises were often made verbally, but the actual implementation was very poor. In the future, we must implement them to the end, and do what we say. Implement key leadership, learn from experience, promote overall work methods, report the situation in a timely manner, and make reports on time. (Nie Wenhua)

　　灵寿分书会议检查生产
  　决心改变自流现象
    【北岳讯】中共灵寿县委于八月初召开全县分委书记联席会，检查该县前段的生产情形，研究今后如何加强全县生产领导。五区分委检查该区生产时说：“区委会不明确生产工作是当前中心任务，在干部使用上，领导生产的干部仅占全部干部的四分之一。发放贷粮贷款，未能很好组织群众，利用它解决生产中的困难，有的贷下去就没有检查，有些人竟把水利贷款买煤、存货，作为私人投机生意的资本。生产因而受了很大的损失。”三区分委对领导生产抓的不紧，致使生产陷于自流，除了实业部门比较关心生产工作外，其他部门都不大注意。何东、程家庄、霍营等村群众自发到工厂里做被服、纳鞋底，区里还没有组织领导。四区分委检查出发放的牲畜贷款，贷户实际买牲口的不到二分之一。根据检查结果作了反复讨论，大家认识到由于未能贯彻执行“华北解放区当前任务”和“把解放区农业生产提高一步”的精神，没有好好领导生产，致全县生产陷于自流，使群众受了很大损失，大家决定今后要集中力量领导生产，“在领导生产中加强群众观念，把全县的生产提高一步。”县委根据各区汇报检查情形，及大会讨论的结果，提出今后领导生产，以种蔬菜、耠地、除草、检查消灭荒地、准备种麦为当前主要任务，并注意压绿肥。检查贷粮贷款，作到专款专用，及时收回，辗转贷发，使贷款川流不息，发挥更大作用。同时广泛组织群众副业生产，利用一切可能的机会，增加群众的财富。四、五区的东半部是平原，可组织群众修补被雨水冲塌、砸毁的织布窨子及织布机子，整理与发展纺织运动。一、二、三区的大部妇女不会纺织，可组织起来给供给部门和工厂作被服、纳鞋底。在领导上，县委特别指示要克服水上漂的作风，每到一地，必须脚踏实地的了解情况，帮助群众解决生产中的具体问题。过去常常口头上答应了，实际上执行的很差，今后必须贯彻始终，说到做到。实行重点领导、吸取经验，推动全盘的工作方法，及时反映情况，按时作报告。（聂文华）
