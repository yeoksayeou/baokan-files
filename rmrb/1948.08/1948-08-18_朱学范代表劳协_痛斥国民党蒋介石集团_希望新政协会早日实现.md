Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th. At the Labor Congress, while discussing the current political situation and the current tasks of the Chinese workers' movement, Zhu Xuefan, representing the China Labor Association, addressed the congress. He first congratulated the congress, which marks the victory of unity of the Chinese working class, and pointed out that this victory is the result of the victorious development of the Chinese People's Liberation War under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao.

Zhu then vehemently condemned the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek as a traitorous clique and enemy of the people. He said: The people of the whole country fought against Japan for eight years, and under the persistence and leadership of the Communist Party of China, drove away Japanese imperialism. But the Kuomintang reactionaries introduced American imperialism to invade China. American troops, planes, and ships can be stationed in China, fly and travel freely; American capital and commodities can set up factories and mines and dump them in China. Zhu asked: "Aren't these many Chiang-America treaties giving China's sovereignty to American imperialism? Isn't the Kuomintang reactionary clique a traitorous clique?" Zhu also stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war, suppressed the democratic movement, and killed the people. Taking the Labor Association as an example, its institutions were seized by armed forces, some members of the Labor Association were killed and arrested, and some cadres were wanted or framed. Workers' organizations in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were all controlled and manipulated by a group of Kuomintang cronies and secret agents. Prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas soared, and workers struggled on the verge of starvation. Workers fought for survival and freedom, but the Kuomintang reactionaries used machine guns, grenades, and bayonets to suppress them. Several thousand workers' leaders and workers were arrested and killed in Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Tianjin, and other places. He said: "Isn't Chiang Kai-shek an enemy of the people? Isn't he a butcher who massacres workers?"

Zhu expressed his complete agreement with the reports of Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun. He said: "Based on the experience of the workers' struggle in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, it proves that Comrade Gao Gang's political report and Comrade Chen Yun's report on the current tasks of the Chinese workers' movement are correct and represent the victorious direction for the Chinese working class to unite and advance. Our working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas must carry out struggles in various ways, gather strength, expand our ranks, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army."

Zhu said: The working class of the whole country must expose all the "peace" conspiracies played by the Kuomintang reactionary clique, supported by American imperialism, which is approaching defeat, and thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang, in China. Finally, on behalf of the Labor Association, he endorsed the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's "May 1st" slogan regarding "convening a new Political Consultative Conference, realizing the convocation of a People's Congress, and establishing a coalition government," and hoped that this new Political Consultative Conference without the participation of reactionaries would be realized soon.

　　朱学范代表劳协 　 痛斥国民党蒋介石集团
  　希望新政协会早日实现
    【新华社东北十五日电】劳动大会在讨论目前政治形势与中国职工运动当前的任务时，朱学范代表中国劳动协会向大会发言。他首先向这次标志中国工人阶级团结胜利的大会祝贺，并指出这一胜利，是在毛主席的英明正确的领导下，中国人民解放战争胜利发展的结果。
    朱氏继即痛斥国民党蒋介石为卖国集团及人民公敌。他说：全国人民八年抗战，在中共的坚持与领导下赶走了日本帝国主义，但国民党反动派又引进了美国帝国主义来侵略中国。美国的军队、飞机、轮船可以在中国驻扎、自由飞行与行驶；美国的资本、商品可以在中国设厂开矿与倾销，朱氏问道：“试问这许多蒋美条约不是拿中国主权送给美帝国主义是什么？国民党反动派不是卖国集团是什么？”朱氏又称：国民党反动派发动内战，镇压民主运动，杀害人民，以劳协为例，她的机构被武装接收了，劳协的会员有些被杀害和拘捕，干部有的被通缉或陷害。国民党统治区工人组织全被国民党的一批党棍子、特务所把持操纵。国民党统治区物价飞涨，工人在饥饿线上挣扎，工人为生存为自由而斗争，但国民党反动派就用机关枪、手榴弹、刺刀来镇压他们。上海、汉口、重庆、天津等地工人领袖与工人被捕被杀的就有好几千。他说：“试问蒋介石不是人民公敌是什么？不是屠杀工人的刽子手是什么？”
    朱氏表示完全同意高岗、陈云同志的报告，他说：“根据国民党统治区工人斗争的经验，证明高岗同志的政治报告和陈云同志的中国职工运动当前任务的报告是正确的，是中国工人阶级团结前进的胜利方向。我们国民党统治区工人阶级要用各种各样的方式进行斗争，聚积力量，扩大队伍，准备迎接人民解放军。”
    朱氏说：全国工人阶级必须揭破接近失败的美帝国主义所支持的国民党反动集团所玩弄的一切“和平”阴谋，要彻底打倒美帝国主义及其走狗国民党在中国的反动统治。最后他代表劳协拥护中共中央“五一”口号中关于“召开新的政协会议，实现召集人民代表大会，成立联合政府”的主张，并希望这一没有反动派参加的新政协早日实现。
