　　Combining Mass Grievances with Combat Mobilization
　　Our Army in Jinzhong Improves Combat Consciousness
　　[Taihang Electric] During the Jinzhong Campaign, a unit of our army on the Jinzhong front achieved excellent results by using the method of combining mass grievances with combat mobilization in a certain area. This greatly stimulated the fighting will and class consciousness of the soldiers and strengthened the connection between the People's Army and the masses in the new areas. The combat mood of the troops was extremely full throughout the entire campaign. At a village meeting where the masses expressed their grievances, Yang Limin, a poor farmer in his fifties, shook his head angrily and said, "If you had come five days earlier, the enemy would not have robbed the wheat from our village. Last year, our village planted more than 120 mu of wheat. Just as it was about to be harvested, the enemy robbed more than 90 mu. The people in our village cried their eyes dry. In the past, our village had 48 households, 296 people, more than 90 head of livestock, and more than 300 sheep; now there are only 16 households, more than 40 people, three head of livestock, and more than 40 sheep left. Some ran away, some died, and some were robbed by the Chiang bandits. The common people had nothing to eat or drink and lived in refugee bureaus. Men worked 20 days a month, and women carried bricks for the enemy to the mountains 20 miles away. Even 13-year-old girls had to carry three bricks for the enemy every day. With beatings and starvation, seven or eight people from our village died in Taiyuan. Some wanted to run away but didn't dare because they were all part of the mutual guarantee system. The common people were looking forward to the Liberation Army day and night. There is no other way except liberation." Yang Yuansheng, an eighty-year-old farmer, accused the enemy of taking his entire family away. Gu Shoufang accused the enemy of robbing all 30 mu of his wheat. District cadre Shi Lanhe accused the Yan bandits of killing his brother and forcibly conscripting his younger brother into the army. Later, because he was sick, the enemy said he was useless and beat him to death with a stick. Many comrades shed tears and expressed their determination to resolutely liberate Jinzhong, fight to Taiyuan to rescue the people, and avenge the masses. Wang Xianghui, the second platoon deputy of the Eighth Company, said, "I was a poor commoner at home and have suffered this kind of crime. I am determined to avenge the masses in Jinzhong and liberate them." Liu Naifang, a liberated soldier of the Eighth Company, said, "I just came from the liberation of Linfen. In the future, I will definitely stand on the same road as everyone and avenge the oppressed people." Xue Mingfu of the machine gun platoon said, "We must respond to the demands of the masses, avenge them, take back the livestock and things of the common people. We will not go home until we liberate the people of Shanxi." After the meeting, everyone discussed who caused the suffering and what we should do. The soldiers' class consciousness was greatly enhanced, and they were determined to resolutely annihilate the Yan bandits and rescue the people of Jinzhong.

　　结合群众诉苦进行战斗动员
  　晋中我军战斗自觉提高
    【太行电】晋中前线我军某部于此次晋中战役中，在某地运用结合群众诉苦进行战斗动员的方式，获得优良成效，大大激发了战士的战斗意志与阶级觉悟，并密切了人民军队与新区群众的连系。部队在整个战役中的战斗情绪始终极为饱满。在驻村群众诉苦会上，五十多岁的贫苦农民杨立民气愤地摇头诉说：“你们早来五天，咱村的麦子也不会被敌人抢走，去年咱村共种了一百二十多亩麦，眼看快要收割就被敌人抢了九十多亩，咱村的人把眼泪哭干了。以前咱村有四十八户，二百九十六人，九十多匹牲口，三百多只羊；现在只剩下十六户人家，四十多口人，三匹牲口，四十多只羊。有的跑了，有的死了，有的叫蒋匪抢走了，老百姓没吃没喝，就住了难民局，男人每月做二十天工，女人给敌人往二十里外的山上运砖，十三岁的小姑娘每天也要给敌人运三个砖。连打带饿，咱村在太谷就死了七、八个。有的想跑也不敢跑，都是具了连环保的。老百姓日日夜夜盼解放军，除解放外别的一点办法也没有了。”八十多岁的农民杨元生，控诉他全家被敌拉去。顾守芳控诉他三十亩麦子都被抢完。区干部石岚和控诉阎匪杀了他的哥哥，抓走他的弟弟当兵，后来因为生病，敌人说留他无用，又一棍打死时的惨景，很多同志流了眼泪，纷纷表示坚决解放晋中，打到太原去抢救老百姓，为群众报仇的决心。八连二排副王祥辉同志说：“我在家是穷苦老百姓，也受过这种罪，我要下决心为晋中群众报仇，解放他们”。八连解放战士刘乃芳同志说：“我是刚从临汾解放过来的，今后我一定和大家站在一条路上，为被压迫的老百姓复仇。”机枪排薛明富同志说：“我们要答复群众要求，替他们报仇，把老百姓的牲口和东西夺回来，解放不了山西老百姓，不回家。”会后大家又讨论了苦是谁给的，我们应该怎么办。战士阶级觉悟大大提高，都决心坚决歼灭阎匪，抢救晋中人民。
