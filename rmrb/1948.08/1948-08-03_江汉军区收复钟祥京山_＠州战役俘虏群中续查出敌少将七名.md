Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Just as the Shandong People's Liberation Army has achieved major victories in the Changwei Campaign and the ＠Zhou Campaign, and Jinan, occupied by the Chiang bandits, is completely isolated, according to a Nanjing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 24th, the "delegation" composed of Shandong native pseudo-legislators, supervisors, and National Assembly representatives recently requested to see Chiang Kai-shek three times to request reinforcements for Jinan, but were refused audience. Chiang Kai-shek, enraged by the continuous requests for audience from these "representatives," burst into rage, cursed, and "threw the representatives' signed petitions on the ground." Furthermore, according to the Qingdao Evening News: In order to shirk his incompetence in the Changwei Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek has given Wang Yaowu, chairman of the Shandong pseudo-provincial government and concurrently director of the Second Pacification Zone, a "demotion with retention of post" punishment, and executed Zhou Qingxiang, commander of the Reorganized 32nd Division.
