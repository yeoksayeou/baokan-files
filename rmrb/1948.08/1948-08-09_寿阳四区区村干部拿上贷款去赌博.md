To the Editor:

    Sun Rui, Zhang Tianxiang, and Wang Yuxiu, district cadres of Shouyang Fourth District, and Zhao Suocheng, the political director of Yaming Village, gambled by playing mahjong at the district office. Zhao Suocheng (a poor peasant) lost 10,000 yuan out of his total loan of 60,000 yuan. The second time, he gambled with Li Baosheng (a poor peasant), the director of the village peasant association, and others, and lost another 10,000 yuan. We hope that the responsible comrades of the Fourth District will conduct a strict inspection of this bad behavior of using loans for improper activities.

    寿阳四区区村干部拿上贷款去赌博
    编辑同志：寿阳四区区干部孙瑞、张天祥、王毓秀和鸦鸣村政治主任赵锁成在区公所打麻将，赵锁成（贫农）共贷款六万元，输了一万。第二次和该村农会主任李保升（贫农）等赌博，又输了一万元。这种利用贷款不作正当事情的恶劣作风，望四区负责同志作严格检查。
