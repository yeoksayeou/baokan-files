　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army, after three days of fighting from the 8th to the 10th on the southern front of the Huanglong Military Sub-district, in one fell swoop annihilated most of the enemy's 36th Division, which had ventured to invade, between Fengyuan Town and Wuzhuang Town northwest of Chengcheng. It is estimated that the division headquarters of the 36th Division, the 165th Brigade headquarters, and its two full regiments, 493rd and 494th, the entire 82nd Regiment of the 28th Brigade, and parts of the 83rd and 84th Regiments, and most of the 123rd Brigade, were wiped out, totaling more than 9,000 enemy soldiers killed, wounded, and captured. Our army then took advantage of the victory to recover the county seats of ＠Yang and Chengcheng on the 10th, and pursued the fleeing enemy 38th Division and 17th Division to the south, killing, wounding, and capturing a part of them. At the same time, the Hu bandit's Provisional 2nd Brigade, New 9th Brigade, and other units that invaded the Guanzhong Military Sub-district, under the shock of our army's victory, fled in panic. The local corps of the People's Liberation Army recovered ＠Yi County and the villages and towns under its jurisdiction, such as Zhanghong and Zhida, on the 10th. According to reports, the Hu bandit's 1st Division, 36th Division, 17th Division, and 38th Division, totaling four divisions, had formed a long, snake-like formation from Tongguan to ＠Yang since the 30th of last month, and advanced rapidly northward along different routes. The enemy's 38th Division on the eastern route advanced from ＠Yang on the 31st of last month. The enemy's 36th Division on the central route advanced from Chengcheng and occupied Fengyuan Town on the 30th of last month, immediately building fortifications in an attempt to defend against our army's attacks with deep trenches and high ramparts. The enemy's 1st Division on the western route advanced north from Kuquan, Tongguan, on the 4th, and was counterattacked by our powerful forces at Bali Shop, and then fled in panic.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army Front Headquarters has announced the preliminary results of the great victory northwest of Chengcheng as follows: 6,049 enemy soldiers were captured, including Zhang Xianjue, the major general chief of staff of the 36th Division; more than 3,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, including Zhu Xia, the major general deputy division commander (killed), and Li Gui, the brigade commander of the 28th Brigade (wounded). 2,236 rifles and carbines, 109 Sten guns, 292 light machine guns, 67 heavy machine guns, 51 60mm mortars, 28 mortars, 2 mountain guns, 3 chemical mortars, more than 450,000 rounds of ammunition, 24 war horses, 450 mules and donkeys, 11 radio stations, 4 walkie-talkies, 6 telephone switchboards, and many other military supplies were seized. Detailed results are still being investigated.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th. The enemy's 36th Division, which was largely annihilated in the area northwest of Chengcheng, was originally one of the three main forces of the Hu bandits. It was first annihilated at Shajia Shop, Mizhi, northern Shaanxi, in August last year. At that time, the 28th Brigade of the division was spared from annihilation because it was trapped in Yulin. Later, the division forcibly conscripted and pieced together a replenishment, barely recovering, but again suffered serious blows in the Jinan and Yuxi areas. Now, less than a year later, it has been annihilated again; and the 28th Brigade, which had escaped by luck last year and was frequently transported by the Hu bandits' planes for emergency use, also suffered a devastating blow in this battle. In more than a year of operations, Hu Zongnan not only lost the three main forces, the 1st Division, the 36th Division, and the 90th Division, but also the re-annihilation of the 36th Division proves that although the Hu bandits replenish quickly, they are annihilated even faster.

　　黄龙南线我军大捷
  　歼灭胡匪主力九千
    乘胜收复＠阳澄城＠邑三城
    【新华社西北十六日电】西北人民解放军于黄龙分区南线经八日至十日三日战斗，在澄城西北冯原镇、五庄镇之间，一举将冒险进犯之敌整三十六师大部歼灭，计歼灭整三十六师师部，一六五旅旅部及所属四九三、四九四两个整团，二十八旅之八十二团全部及八十三、八十四两团各一部，整一二三旅大部，共毙伤俘其九千余人。我军继即乘胜于十日收复＠阳、澄城两县城，并向南追击狼狈溃逃之敌整三十八师、整十七师，毙伤俘其一部。同时侵犯关中分区的胡匪暂二旅、新九旅等部，在我军胜利震慑下，仓皇回窜，解放军地方兵团当于十日收复＠邑县城及所属的张洪、织田等村镇。按胡匪整一师、整三十六师、整十七师及整三十八师等四个师兵力，自上月三十日起，由同官至＠阳摆成一字长蛇阵，急步向前，分路北犯。东路敌三十八师于上月三十一日起，由＠阳出犯。中路敌三十六师由澄城出犯，于上月三十日侵占冯原镇后，即大事修筑工事，图以深沟高垒来防御我军的攻击。西路同官敌整一师四日自苦泉北犯，在八里店遭我军有力部队反击，即狼狈溃退。
    【新华社西北十六日电】西北解放军前线司令部顷公布澄城西北大捷初步战果如下：俘敌三十六师少将参谋长张先觉以下六千零四十九名，毙伤敌少将副师长朱侠（毙）、二十八旅旅长李规（伤）以下三千余人。缴获步马枪二二三六支，司登式一零九支，轻机枪二九二挺，重机枪六十七挺，六○炮五十一门，迫击炮二十八门，山炮二门，化学炮三门，子弹四十五万余发，战马二十四匹，骡、驴四百五十头，电台十一部，报话机四部，电话总机六部，其他军用品甚多。详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社西北十六日电】此次在澄城西北地区大部被歼的敌整三十六师，原系胡匪三大主力之一。去年八月于陕北米脂沙家店首次被歼灭，当时该师二十八旅因困守榆林，得免被歼。后该师又强拉壮丁，补充拼凑，勉强恢复，但复于晋南、豫西地区，迭遭严重打击。至今为时不到一年，即又再次被歼；而去年侥幸脱逃并被胡匪经常用飞机运来运去应急的二十八旅，在此次战斗中，也受到歼灭性的打击。胡宗南在年余作战中，不但损失了整一师、整三十六师及整九十师等三大主力部队，且从三十六师的再次被歼，证明胡匪增补虽快，但被歼也更快。
