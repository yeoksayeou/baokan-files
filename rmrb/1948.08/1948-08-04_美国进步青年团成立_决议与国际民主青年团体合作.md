Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—TASS reports: Under the auspices of the youth department of the National Committee supporting Wallace's election, over two thousand representatives of young American workers, farmers, and students held a National Youth Congress in Philadelphia's auditorium on July 26th amidst fervent singing and cheering. The congress passed a resolution to establish a permanent youth organization—the American Progressive Youth League—and its program, which calls for the United States to establish peaceful relations with other countries, especially with the Soviet Union, and to expand the democratic rights of the American people. The program vehemently denounces the Republican and Democratic parties' election platforms as "desperate programs." The congress passed the Progressive Party's platform, pointing out that it conforms to the interests of American youth. Progressive Party presidential and vice-presidential candidates Wallace and Taylor, and black leader Robeson, all attended the congress and delivered speeches. The congress also passed several resolutions to cooperate with international democratic youth organizations, oppose the conscription law, dissolve the "House Un-American Activities Committee," and support civil rights bills (including demands to stop the prosecution of twelve Communist Party leaders).
