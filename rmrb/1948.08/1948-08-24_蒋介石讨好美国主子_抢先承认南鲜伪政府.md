    Chiang Kai-shek Flatters His American Masters
  　Rushing to Recognize the Puppet Government of South Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] Comprehensive report: The South Korean puppet government, concocted single-handedly by American imperialism, formally made its debut on the 15th. In order to curry favor with its American masters, the Kuomintang government preemptively "provisionally recognized" this puppet government on the 12th, and sent Liu Yuwan as a "diplomatic representative" with the rank of ambassador. On the same day, the U.S. government also announced "temporary recognition of the Korean government established in South Korea under U.S. military occupation as a government that can represent the entire Korean nation" (United Press). In order to create a "fait accompli" of dividing Korea and further controlling South Korea before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in September, the American reactionaries hurriedly completed their conspiracy to create a South Korean puppet state. This conspiracy to undermine the Potsdam Declaration and the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Agreement was exposed as early as the United Nations meetings from September to November last year. At that time, the United States rejected the Soviet Union's reasonable proposal, namely: to seek the opinions of Korean people's representatives, and to withdraw troops first to ensure that the Korean people conduct free elections and establish an independent and unified government. The United States manipulated the majority vote at the meeting and passed a resolution that violated the principles of the Charter, namely: under the "supervision" of the so-called "United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea" (the Soviet Union refused to participate in the commission), which the United States could obviously control, elections would be held in Korea during the continued stationing of occupying forces, and a government would be established. Subsequently, the American conspiracy was staged in a series of events: on May 10, a sham election was held in South Korea; on May 31, a fake National Assembly was convened; on July 11, a fake constitution was passed; and now, the puppet government has been formally established. Regarding the establishment of this puppet government directed single-handedly by American imperialism, even the Australian representative, James, who originally participated in the so-called "United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea," believed that it could not represent the Korean people and opposed discussing it. The Korean people have always opposed this American conspiracy. At the beginning of July, the democratic parties and groups of North and South Korea decided at the Pyongyang meeting to hold genuine democratic elections and establish a democratic and unified legislative body and government to strive for the realization of an independent, unified, and democratic Korean nation.

    蒋介石讨好美国主子
  　抢先承认南鲜伪政府
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合报导：美国帝国主义一手泡制出来的南鲜傀儡政府，已于十五日正式粉墨登场。国民党政府为了献媚美国主子，竟于十二日抢先“临时承认”这个傀儡政府，并派刘驭万为大使衔的“外交代表”。同日，美国政府亦宣布“暂行承认在美军占领下的南鲜成立之韩国政府为可以代表朝鲜全国之政府”（合众社）。美国反动派为了赶在九月间联合国大会开幕之前，造成分裂朝鲜与进一步控制南鲜的“既成事实”，所以急急忙忙完成它制造南鲜傀儡国的阴谋。这种破坏波茨顿宣言和莫斯科三外长协定的阴谋，远在去年九月至十一月的联合国会议上即已开始暴露。当时美国拒绝苏联的合理方案，即：征询朝鲜人民代表的意见，及先行撤兵以保证朝鲜人民进行自由选举和成立独立统一的政府。美国在会上操纵了多数票，通过了违反宪章原则的方案，即：在美国显然可以把持的所谓“联合国朝鲜临时委员会”（苏联拒绝参加该委员会）的“监督”下，在占领军继续驻扎期间，在朝鲜进行选举与成立政府。其后，美国阴谋就连串地演出了：五月十日南鲜举行了伪选；五月卅一日召开了伪国民会议；七月十一日通过了伪宪；而现在，则正式成立伪政府。对于美帝国主义一手导演的这一个傀儡政府的成立，连原来参加所谓“联合国朝鲜临时委员会”的澳代表詹米特，都认为它不能代表朝鲜人民，而反对和它商谈。朝鲜人民始终是反对美国这种阴谋的。七月初南北鲜各民主党派团体于平壤会议上即决定举行真正的民主选举和建立民主统一的立法机关与政府，来争取独立、统一、民主的朝鲜国家的实现。
