    Nowhere Left to Hide
    Bandit Division Commander Chen Zhiping Captured Alive
    Ping-Bao Frontline Communication

    At 7:00 PM on the 16th, when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) launched a fierce attack on Dingxing, Chiang bandit Provisional 31st Division Commander Chen Zhiping and his officers were preparing to defend the city for five days, awaiting reinforcements. However, from the start of the attack at 7:00 PM, it only took half an hour for the PLA to mount the city walls. Within another half hour, the PLA poured into the city, quickly occupying most of it and reaching the division headquarters. Chen Zhiping was caught off guard and hastily grabbed the special service company and the military police. He launched a counterattack, but the PLA mowed them down with machine gun fire. Chen Zhiping then abandoned his division headquarters and fled with a few trusted adjutants, hiding in a bomb shelter. Later, they hid in a detached house. The PLA launched a general offensive to wipe out the enemy within the city, and one unit happened to advance towards Chen Zhiping's hideout. The Third Company of a certain unit, split into two groups, pressed towards the house along the city walls. The combat team of Qin Taisheng and Zhao Quanfu used a small flanking maneuver to approach the detached house, shouting: "Treat prisoners well! Surrender and you won't be killed!" The enemies inside the house still didn't come out. The anxious soldiers shouted even louder: "If you don't believe us, I'll bet my head on it!" Chen Zhiping, seeing that the situation was hopeless and there was no way out, had no choice but to send someone out to make a tentative surrender to the PLA, to see if they would kill them or not. The first to come out was an adjutant, the second was the adjutant director, and the third was himself. After surrendering their weapons, the PLA ordered him to stop resisting, so he wrote an order: "Cease fire, lay down your weapons, the PLA is lenient..." Chen Zhiping's panicked state was clearly revealed in his writing. He almost forgot how to write, constantly asking as he wrote: "Is this how you write it? Is this how you write it?" Afterwards, he was taken off the front lines.

    躲来躲去没地方再躲
    匪师长陈志平被活捉
    平保前线通讯
    十六日下午七点钟，解放军猛攻定兴时，蒋匪暂编三十一师师长陈志平和他的将校们，准备在这里防御五天，以待援兵。但是，从进攻开始到七点半，只半个钟头，解放军就登上城头，再半小时，解放军源源入城，很快占领了城内大部分，打到了师部，陈志平措手不及，仓忙抓住特务连和军士队。反扑了一下，被解放军一顿机关枪，打得乱七八糟。于是，陈志平就丢了他的师部，带了几个亲信副官，逃到一个防弹洞里躲起来，后来，又藏在一所独立家屋里。解放军向城内歼敌展开总攻，有一路就恰恰打到陈志平这逃命的地方。某部三连，分上下二股，沿着城墙往这儿压。秦泰升、赵全福他们的战斗小组，用一个小迂回动作，进到独立家屋的附近，喊道：“优待俘虏！缴枪不杀！”屋里的敌人还不出来，着急的战士更喊道：“你们不信，我用脑袋保险！”陈志平眼看大势已去，无可奈何，只得让人出来向解放军作试探性投降，看杀也不杀。第一个出来的是副官，第二个出来的是副官主任，第三个才是他自己。缴枪以后，解放军命令他停止抵抗，于是他写了：“停止射击，放下武器，解放军宽大………”的命令。陈志平慌张的情绪，明显的露在笔上，他几乎忘了如何写法，写时不断地问：“是这样写吗？是这样写吗？”以后他被送下火线。
