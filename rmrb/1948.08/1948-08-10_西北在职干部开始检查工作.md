Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, August 5th: The CCP Northwest Central Bureau is now vigorously organizing and leading an on-the-job cadre study movement. Following the "July 1st" study mobilization meeting, it immediately proceeded with the organization and planning of specific studies. In mid-July, it convened a meeting of the study committees from various systems to report on study mobilization and organization. The Standing Committee of the Northwest Bureau decided to make leading the on-the-job cadre study one of the most important tasks at present, and appointed Comrade Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, to specifically lead the work. At the border region level, study committees have been established in various organs, and leading comrades from various departments have participated in the leadership. Comrades He Long, Lin Boqu, Xi Zhongxun, and others have all participated in the study leadership of various systems' study committees. The Standing Committee stipulated that the tasks of each study committee are: to grasp ideological leadership, implement the study policies of the Party Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau; to plan study progress; to check study progress, summarize study experience, and report to the Northwest Bureau in a timely manner. At the reporting meeting in mid-July, Comrade Ma Mingfang instructed: The focus of the first phase (from July 15th to August 15th) of study is to, according to the spirit of the documents stipulated by the Northwest Bureau, link with reality, begin to examine the state of anarchism and indiscipline, as well as empiricism and localism in the work, and improve work and ideological style at any time during the examination. At present, the study movement in various departments has been enthusiastically launched, and inspections are being carried out in the spirit of conscious reflection, criticism and self-criticism, in connection with the work of the department and individual thoughts.
