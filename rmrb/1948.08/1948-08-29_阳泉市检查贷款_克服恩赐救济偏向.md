　　Yangquan City Inspects Loans
  　Overcome Tendency of Charity and Relief
    [North Yue News] From last autumn to this spring, Yangquan City's second, third, and fourth districts (the third and fourth districts were transferred from Pingding County in July) issued a total of 274,000 catties of grain and 67.6 million yuan in loans to support coal, iron, agricultural, and sideline production, which played a significant role. However, due to the strong charitable and relief viewpoints among cadres when issuing loans, and insufficient understanding that loans must be used for production and must be repaid, the loan work has resulted in serious deviations. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects: First, according to incomplete statistics, much of the grain loaned to the masses was eaten, with very little used for production. Taolin Gou Village in the third district borrowed 1,000 catties of grain in April of this year, 800 catties were loaned to the Jinchang Coal Mine, and 200 catties were loaned to the masses in four grades based on "political status" and the degree of poverty to be eaten. Shi Guangyuan of Taohugou Village in the fourth district borrowed one dou of grain and sold a batch of towels, but both the principal and interest were eaten. Second, most of the grain loaned to coal kilns and iron furnaces was lost. Many coal kilns and iron furnaces cooperatively run by workers faced great difficulties due to a lack of or insufficient funds. After borrowing grain, due to poor management or using it to relieve workers, the loaned grain was lost. Jinhou Mine in Longfenggou Village, third district, had been shut down for one or two decades due to water in the pit and thin coal seams. After liberation last year, workers barely mined to maintain their livelihoods. In April of this year, they borrowed 1,600 catties of millet. The nine workers earned five catties of rice every day, regardless of how much they produced. They said, "What are we afraid of with the loaned grain? If we run out, we'll borrow more." Recently, the loaned grain has been exhausted, and they are asking for more loans. Tongxin Mine in Liugou Village had more than 3,000 catties of millet in capital, all from struggle fruits. This spring, the pit flooded, making it impossible to mine. To help drain the water, they borrowed more than 1,000 catties of rice. Regardless of the strength of the labor force or the amount of water pumped each day, they earned five catties of millet each. As a result, after pumping for several months, both the capital and the loaned grain were lost, and the water was not completely drained, so mining was still impossible. Third, borrowers have a dependent mentality of "not repaying loans," so they are not motivated to produce. The masses in Laohugou Village said, "In the past, the public did not collect the grain and money they lent. This time, they probably won't want the loaned grain either. It's a real bargain to be able to borrow grain." Some said, "Loaned grain is just to help us eat." With this thought, everyone wanted to borrow more. Some military families did not plan production but asked to borrow several stones of grain. Fourth, loan procedures were sloppy and chaotic. Most of the grain loans in each village were issued through the Workers' and Peasants' Association. Some villages still have loan ledgers, while other villages do not even know who was loaned grain or how much was loaned. Due to sloppy procedures, collection is difficult and the masses' dependent mentality of not repaying loans is encouraged. After inspecting the serious deviations that occurred in the grain and loan work, the Yangquan Municipal Committee, the Municipal Government, and the bank are now carrying out a cleanup and correction. In mid-August, the bank sent cadres to the countryside to cooperate with the organization of production and correction work to clean up old loans. In this cleanup, it was decided to do three things: (1) Widely publicize and explain loan policies to the masses and village cadres to reverse the relief and charity viewpoints in their thinking. (2) Borrowers must rewrite loan agreements, which must specify interest, repayment dates, and guarantors. (3) On the principle of not affecting production, those who can repay must repay immediately so that the money can be re-loaned. Those who really cannot repay can postpone repayment, and help them produce. Repayment must be made by the autumn harvest at the latest.

### 阳泉市检查贷款　克服恩赐救济偏向

　　阳泉市检查贷款
  　克服恩赐救济偏向
    【北岳讯】阳泉市二、三、四区（三、四区是七月由平定县划来的）去秋到今春共发放贷粮二十七万四千斤，贷款六千七百六十万元，扶助煤铁、农副业生产，起了不少作用。但由于发放贷款时，干部思想上有浓厚的恩赐救济观点，对贷款必须用于生产、贷款必须归还的认识不够，致使贷粮款工作产生严重偏向。这主要表现在下面几方面：一、据不完全统计：群众贷到的粮食，有许多都吃掉了，用于生产的很少。三区桃林沟村今年四月贷粮一千斤，八百斤贷给晋昌煤矿，二百斤根据“政治地位”与贫穷程度，分四等贷给群众吃。四区桃虎沟村史光远贷粮一斗，贩卖了一次毛巾，本来本利都吃光了。二、煤窑铁炉贷粮大部赔完。很多工人合作经营的煤窑、铁炉，因资金少或无资金，经营很困难。贷粮后因不善利用或以之救济工人，结果把贷粮都赔了。三区龙逢沟村晋厚矿，因坑内有水，炭层又薄，已停工一、二十年，去年解放后，工人为了维持生活，勉强开采。今年四月贷小米一千六百斤，九个工人，每日不管生产多少，都赚五斤米。他们说：“有贷粮顶着怕什么？没有了再去贷。”最近贷粮已消耗完了，又要求重贷。刘沟村同心矿有资本三千多斤小米，都是斗争果实。今春坑内涨水，无法开采，为了帮助排水，又贷米一千余斤。不管劳动力强弱，不论每日打水多少，都是赚五斤小米，结果打了几个月，资本和贷粮都赔完了，也未打完水，仍然无法开采。三、贷户存在着“贷粮不还”的依赖思想，因此生产不起劲。老虎沟村的群众说：“过去公家贷的粮款都不收，这回贷粮大概也不要了，能贷到粮，真是个便宜。”有的说：“贷粮就是救济咱们吃的。”有了这个思想，大家都想多贷，有的军属不计划生产，却要求贷粮数石。四、贷粮款手续马虎混乱。各村贷粮大部经过工农会发放，有些村庄还有贷粮帐，有的村庄则连贷粮给谁，贷了多少，都不知道。由于手续马虎，造成催收困难，并助长了群众贷粮不还的依赖思想。阳泉市委会、市政府和银行检查了贷粮贷款工作发生的严重偏向后，现正进行清理纠正。八月中旬银行派干部下乡，配合组织生产与纠偏工作，进行清理旧贷。在这次清理中，决定要做好三件事情：（一）向群众和村干部广泛宣传解释贷款政策，扭转他们思想中的救济与恩赐观点。（二）贷户要补写借约，在借约中要写明利息，归还日期及保人。（三）在不影响生产的原则下，能归还的要立即归还，以便转贷，真正无法归还的，可以延期，帮助他们生产，最迟到秋收后一定归还。
