　　Taiyue Telegram: The 1,400 laborers from Yangcheng who went to central Shanxi returned victoriously on the 18th. During the 80 days of wartime support missions, the laborers fully demonstrated a high degree of awareness, bravery, resourcefulness, obedience to leadership, and discipline. The Central Shanxi Frontline Headquarters awarded them a banner with the inscription: "Undeterred by Hardship, Hunger, and Thirst; United in One Heart, Carry Through to the End." In the hail of bullets, the Yangcheng laborers risked their lives to rescue the wounded. Xie Quande, a special-class meritorious worker, was in the Zhanglan battle when a soldier rushed into the third layer of a five-story bunker and was wounded. Xie Quande, with his stretcher, quickly climbed a five-zhang-high (approximately 16.4 meters) ladder and carried the wounded comrade down. All the laborers in the county cared for the wounded as if they were their own brothers. Some braved danger to find water for the wounded, while others used their own clothes and bedding to cover the wounded and wrap their wounds. Huo Dongjin, a special-class meritorious worker, once used his own quilt to wrap the body of a deceased deputy battalion commander, covered it with straw mats, and secured it with stones. In frontline transportation, the laborers ensured a steady supply of ammunition. They took great care of the ammunition, using their straw hats and clothes to cover the ammunition when it rained. They would also dry it out whenever they took a break. They also frequently promoted various policies among the masses in the newly liberated areas, encouraging those who had fled to slowly return. Their discipline was excellent, leaving a good impression on the people in the newly liberated areas. When staying in a village, one family had a large apricot tree in their courtyard, laden with ripe yellow apricots, but not a single person touched one. This campaign involved a lot of field operations, but wherever they went, even if they only stayed for a day or two, they would take the time to help the villagers harvest wheat, till the land, thresh grain, and water gardens. Carrying water and sweeping courtyards, etc., had become their habit, so they were welcomed everywhere by the masses.

　　不辞劳苦忍饥忍渴
  　万众一心坚持到底
  　阳城民工胜利完成参战任务
    【太岳电】阳城出征晋中的一千四百个民工，于十八日胜利归来。在八十天的战勤任务中，民工们充分表现了高度的觉悟与勇敢机智、服从领导、遵守纪律的精神。晋中前线后方指挥部特颁给“不辞劳苦，忍饥忍渴，万众一心，贯彻到底”的奖旗。阳城民工在枪林弹雨中，出生入死的抢救伤员。特等功臣谢全德在张兰战斗中，一个战士冲入了五层高碉的第三层时负伤了，谢全德领着自己的一付担架迅速爬上五丈高的云梯，把彩号抬下来。全县民工爱护伤员都象爱护自己的弟兄一样。有的冒着危险给伤员找水，有的用自己的衣被给伤员铺盖，裹伤口。特等功臣霍东金曾用自己的被子，把牺牲了的副营长裹起来，上面又盖上席子，用石头垒住。在前线运输上，民工更保证了弹药源源供给。他们非常爱护弹药，下雨时就拿自己的草帽和衣服把弹药盖好。一休息下就晾晒。他们还常向新区群众宣传各种政策。使躲在外边的人敢于慢慢回来。他们的纪律良好，给予新区群众良好的印象。在某村住时，有一家院内有一棵大杏树，上面结着黄腊腊的杏子，就没有一个人去动一颗。这次战役野战很多，但他们每到一地，那怕住一两天，也要抽空帮助老乡割麦锄地、打场浇园，至于担水扫院等等，已成为他们的习惯，所以到处受到群众的欢迎。
