Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The National Labor Congress recently received congratulatory messages from the Labor Committee of the American Democratic Far East Policy Committee and Fitzgerald, Vice Chairman of the American Progressive Party and Chairman of the National Labor Advocates for Wallace and Taylor Election Committee, sent in June to the Chinese Liberated Area Workers' Representative Conference. Because the telegram was sent to the Hong Kong China Business Daily for forwarding in June, it only recently arrived in Harbin. When the conference opened on August 1st, it was changed to the Sixth Chinese Labor Congress. Therefore, the congratulatory message still uses the name of the Chinese Liberated Area Workers' Conference.

(1) Congratulatory message from the Labor Committee of the Democratic Far East Policy Committee on June 12 (Lu Maode, Chairman of the Democratic Far East Policy Committee, stated in his telegram to the conference on June 12: As of the time of sending the telegram, American trade unions have signed 110 names on the congratulatory message, including trade union groups from 14 states, including the chairmen of four national trade unions, one vice chairman, three secretaries or treasurers, 72 trade union signatures, 5 local branches, 24 district branches, and 19 national unions are industrial unions. A detailed list will be reported later):

The Chinese Liberated Area Workers' Representative Conference is a fundamental step in promoting China towards unity, peace, and democracy. We wish it success. This committee is determined to continue to fight against American interference in China. (Signed by Lu Maode, Chairman of the Labor Committee).

(2) Fitzgerald's congratulatory telegram on June 15:

The All-China Liberated Area Workers' Representative Conference is the most promising harbinger of China's future unification, a unification built on the will of all the Chinese people and their joint efforts for democracy and construction. Millions of Americans stand with the New Party, opposing the bipartisan foreign policy of the US government's armed intervention in China's internal affairs. I am confident that I can represent them in extending warm congratulations to your conference and to all the workers of China. Sooner or later, the workers of all China, together with the people of all countries, will defeat the selfish groups that are currently hindering all mankind from achieving peace and prosperity.

　　是中国统一的前兆　是中国人民的意志
  　美国民主团体祝贺劳大
    【新华社东北二十七日电】全国劳动大会近获美国民主远东政策委员会职工委员会、美国进步党副主席之一兼全国劳工拥护华莱士和泰勒竞选委员会主席费兹吉拉德六月致中国解放区职工代表大会的祝词贺电，因为电报是六月间发给香港华商报转的，故最近才到哈埠，而大会在八月一日开幕时始改为举行中国第六次劳动大会，因此，祝词还是用的中国解放区职工大会名义。
    （一）民主远东政策委员会职工委员会六月十二日祝词（民主远东政策委员会理事长陆懋德在其六月十二日致大会的电报中称：美国各职工会截至发电时止，签名于祝词上者已有一百一十个名字，包括十四个州的职工团体，其中有四个全国性的职工会的主席，一个副主席，三个秘书或司库，职工会的签名则有七十二个，地方支会五个，区分会二十四个，全国性的工会中有十九个为产业工会。详细名单容后报导）：
    中国解放区职工代表大会是促成中国走向团结、和平与民主的根本步骤，谨祝成功。本会誓必继续奋斗，反对美国干涉中国。（职工委员会理事长陆懋德签名）。
    （二）费兹吉拉德六月十五日贺电：
    全中国解放区职工代表大会是中国将来统一的最有希望的前兆，这种统一是建立在全中国人民的意志及其为民主和建设所作的共同努力基础之上的。千百万的美国人都站在新党方面，反对美国政府武装干涉中国内政的两党外交政策。我确信我能够代表他们向你们大会和全中国工人表示热烈的贺意。全中国的工人与世界各国的人民在一起，迟早必将战胜目前正在阻碍全人类获致和平与富足的自私自利的集团。
