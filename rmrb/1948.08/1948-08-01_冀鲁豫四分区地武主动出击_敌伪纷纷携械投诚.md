    Enemy and Puppet Troops Surrender with Weapons

    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] The local armed forces of the Fourth Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province took the initiative to attack. On June 28th, in Liuyuan Village, south of Yanjin City, they completely destroyed the puppet Liuhou Township Office, capturing 11 people including the puppet deputy township chief, and seizing 19 rifles and 4 pistols. On the 30th, they ambushed the bandit Wang Sanzhu's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd regiments in the Tongcun area, killing and wounding over 100 bandits. Under our continuous attacks and political offensives, more and more bandits and puppet troops in various places are surrendering to us with their weapons. Recently, Zhu Zhanxiang, the puppet township chief of Liuguang Township in Fengqiu, led 14 people from the township office, carrying 12 rifles and 2 pistols, to surrender to us. Gao Yinxiang, the captain of the Second Brigade of the puppet Zhao Zhenting, brought 8 soldiers, carrying 2 pistols, to surrender to our army. A squad of local bandits from Junxian County also recently surrendered to us, led by squad leader Wang Haosheng, carrying more than 10 long and short guns.

    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] During the Yu-East Campaign around 睢(sui) County, the masses in the counties south of the Yellow River enthusiastically supported the front. Stretcher teams from Nanwang, Yuncheng and other counties, after a nearly 300-mile forced march, arrived at the front line on time. In Qibin, Kaocheng and other counties, the masses ground flour for the troops day and night, saying, "As long as old Chiang is eliminated, we are willing to work hard no matter what." The masses in a certain village in Kaocheng (a new district) took out their own quilts, beds, benches, etc., to help a certain unit arrange accommodation for the wounded, and quickly made meals for the wounded. The masses in Taying and other villages in the county ground 10,000 catties of white flour in one day, delivering it on time to the station 30 miles away, completing the task.

    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan 24th Telegram] The militia of the Sixth Sub-district killed, wounded, and captured more than 500 enemies in half a year. From January 18th to June 20th, the militia of our Sixth Sub-district fought a total of 296 battles on the river defense and border areas, including 101 battles in coordination with regular troops, killing 131 enemies, wounding 321 enemies, and capturing 62 enemies (including "home-returning corps"), totaling 514 people.
