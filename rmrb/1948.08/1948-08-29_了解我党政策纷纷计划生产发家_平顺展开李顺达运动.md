[Taihang News] The Pingshun districts and villages organized Party members and the masses to study the Taihang Third Prefectural Committee's circular commending Li Shunda and Comrade Xiang Ti, further clarifying our Party's production policies. The county Party committee, based on the circular, called on the people of the county to launch the Li Shunda movement, using Li Shunda's vivid examples to educate and inspire everyone's thinking on production and prosperity. After studying the posters, the Hongni branch in the Sixth District immediately began self-criticism among its members. Liu Linnian said, "After Party rectification, I wasn't proactive in leading the work and only wanted to rely on everyone. This is wrong, and I'm even worse than Shunda." Lao Yingsong and Xin Fa (Party members) said, "After hearing the circular, we really can't call ourselves models. In the future, we must listen to the Party's call and learn from Li Shunda in leading the masses to develop production and become prosperous." The Xigou Second District first studied the circular within the branch and then among the masses, and everyone resolved to catch up with Li Shunda. Lu Wenquan, Wang Zhouze, and twelve other households have already set out a five-year plan for prosperity and construction. Here, the soil is poor and the land is thin, a poor mountain gully. Within five years, they will build fifteen rooms of two-story houses, twenty-one rooms of single-story houses, three cave dwellings with second floors, level ten and a half mu of land, plant forty-six mu of forest, increase the number of donkeys and cattle by fifteen, increase the number of sheep by one hundred and twenty-five, sew twenty-eight sets of new quilts and bedding, buy fourteen felt blankets, and acquire a set of farm tools. Guo Yu'en, a labor hero from Chuandi First District, after repeated study in the branch, returned home and convened a family meeting to study the circular. The whole family responded to the Party's call and resolved to become prosperous. Yu'en's mother said, "I've suffered all my life in the past, without enough to eat or wear. The Communist Party came to lead us to turn over a new leaf, and now they're leading us to become prosperous, telling us to build houses. We are happy to do that." Yu'en's father said, "I'm fifty-eight years old this year, and I'm still good at doing manual labor. As for construction, if Shunda can do it, so can we. We have to plan it well." The whole family discussed and set out a five-year plan for prosperity and construction, deciding to first build three southwest-facing rooms after autumn, build a gate tower next year, build a three-room loft in the year after, build a cave dwelling in 1951, and build a three-room loft in the north house in 1952. They will reclaim one mu of wasteland each year, develop a flock of forty sheep, buy two cows in five years, and make a hand-cranked machine. Now they have three new felt blankets each, and they will buy two more felt blankets and sew three quilts, so that everyone has new clothes. Cui Fubao, a labor hero from Anyang Seventh District, also set out a two-year plan. He said, "I have already prepared myself ideologically. This autumn, I will build five two-story houses, build a courtyard wall and a gate tower, buy a donkey, make new quilts and new clothes, raise a pig, and also cultivate codonopsis pilosula and engage in transportation, which will be enough to cover expenses." He is no longer eating chaff now. Shen Haijiao of Anle Fourth District studied Li Shunda's direction and resolved to catch up with Li Shunda. His millet and corn have been hoed three times, the corn has been top-dressed, and the cotton has been hoed five times. He plans to plant five mu of wheat this year, plow three times, apply 270 dan of sheep manure to three mu, apply 70 dan of artemisia fertilizer to one mu, and completely use soil to cover the remaining one mu. Yang Yonggao, a labor hero from Yanggao Fourth District, plans to build five more rooms and level one mu of land. He said that buying land is not as good as leveling land. Buying land does not increase the amount of land; it just changes the owner. Leveling one mu can increase it by one mu. He used to raise a donkey jointly with three households and plans to buy one alone and develop a flock of thirty sheep. Li Shunda himself, along with Guo Yu'en, Cui Fubao, and others, led the villages of Xigou, Chuandi, and Anyang to complete the three rounds of hoeing on time, conduct mutual inspections, elect heroes and models, and also set out plans for cutting artemisia and accumulating fertilizer, launching a fertilizer accumulation movement. The Li Shunda movement, combined with the current production tasks, directly promoted the great production movement in Pingshun.
