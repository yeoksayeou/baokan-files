　　Wasteful Eating and Drinking by Many Village Cadres in the Sixth District of Huolu Urgently Needs Correction
    In the Sixth District (New District) of Huolu, the village cadres universally ate public meals during the summer grain requisition, resulting in serious waste and increased burden on the masses. The cadres of Chendi Village ate for 35 days from the 28th day of the fifth lunar month, wasting 155.625 kg of white flour, 135 kg of seeds, and other miscellaneous expenses such as oil and vinegar totaling 28,700 yuan. Additionally, they consumed 2.5 kg of alcohol and 39,100 yuan worth of meat. In total, this amounted to 300,990 yuan in foreign currency, an average of 740 yuan per mu, equivalent to 1.125 kg of millet. Li Laizi, the chairman of the village peasant association, believed that eating public meals was justified. He said, "We are so busy with the summer requisition; who would work if we didn't eat something?" However, he also said, "When it's time to eat, people appear from everywhere, but when it's time to work, nobody's around." During these public meals, the village even employed two old men specifically as cooks. Other villages ate for three to five days, or ten days to half a month, in varying durations. In many villages in the Sixth District, village finances are extremely chaotic. For example, Weitong Village spent over 100,000 yuan in public funds to celebrate the departure of five team members for the front, with people eating and drinking filling the entire courtyard. This required an assessment of 0.075 kg to 0.1 kg of wheat per mu to cover the expenses. When the district held a training class for village cadres, the chairmen of the peasant associations of Xiaoyudi and Duantong villages used public funds to buy a large quantity of cigarettes as gifts. County and district cadres should conduct a thorough investigation into this bad practice of seriously wasting the people's wealth and promptly correct it. (Zhai Xuezhi)

　　获鹿六区不少村干吃喝浪费亟应纠正
    获鹿六区（新区）各村干部，在夏征时普遍吃公饭浪费很严重，增加了群众的负担。彻底村干部自阴历五月二十八起，吃了三十五天，浪费白面一百五十五斤十两，种子二百七十斤，油醋等杂支二万八千七百元；另酒五斤十两，肉三万九千一百元。以上共合洋三十万零九百九十元，每亩平均摊派七百四十元，折小米一斤十二两。村农会主席李来子认为吃公饭是应该的，他说：“夏微这么忙，不吃点谁还干工作？”但是，他又说：“吃饭啦人不知道从哪儿都来了，一工作就没人了。”这村吃公饭时，还专用着两个老头当伙夫。其他村有吃三天五天的，有吃十天半月的不等。六区许多村庄，村财政非常混乱，位同村一次欢送五个队员远征，吃了十万元以上，吃饭喝酒的人站了满院子，每亩地需摊派小麦一斤三、四两，才够这次花费。区里开村干训练班时，小于底、段同村农会主席，用公款买许多纸烟送礼。这种严重浪费人民财富的坏作风，县区干部应认真深入检查，迅速纠正。（翟学智）
