    Jinnan Administrative Office Issues Instructions on Primary School Education
    Correcting Leftist Deviations
    Improving Students' Culture
    [Jinnan News] Since this spring, a certain degree of chaos has emerged in the primary school education work of various counties in Jinnan. Many teachers are ideologically confused. Some are passive and perfunctory, "tolling the bell as long as they are monks for the day," and frequently go home. Others are afraid of making mistakes, believing that "it is better to do less than more." Still others think that teaching has no future and want to change careers. The number of schools and students has generally decreased. In Qi County, there were 179 primary schools last year, but this year it has decreased to 149. The number of male and female students has decreased by 60 percent. In Zhou Lizhangtun Village, Xiajin, there were 150 students last year, but only more than 50 this year. Similar phenomena exist in other counties as well.

    The reasons for this situation are: mainly that during the land reform period, some areas made "leftist" errors, wrongly applied the "three investigations" used on cadres to schools, failed to distinguish between right and wrong, and dismissed a large number of teachers. According to statistics from ten counties in the Fourth Special District, there were 2,866 teachers last year, and 1,499 were dismissed last winter. In Handan City and the Fourth District of Handan County, two-thirds of the teachers were dismissed. The dismissed teachers were dissatisfied with us, and the remaining teachers felt that teaching was not secure and were passive and slack. Therefore, they had no choice but to close down a large number of primary schools. The newly promoted teachers had a low level of education and no teaching experience, known as "good class background but no culture," which could not meet the requirements of students and the masses, and the number of children entering school also decreased significantly. Furthermore, students were often made to participate in so-called social activities and production, which greatly affected their cultural learning. Some only had one class a day, others had no class for several days, and generally they only read one book a year, making the masses feel that their children could not learn anything in school. Some primary schools mobilized poor and hired peasant students to struggle against students from landlord and rich peasant families, confiscating their books and bedding or refusing them admission without any reason, resulting in a large reduction in the number of students.

    In order to correct the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena and rectify and strengthen primary school education, the Jinnan Administrative Office has put forward the following improvement measures: First, we must quickly correct the past "leftist" adventurist errors, and re-examine the teachers who were dismissed in the past based on the spirit of unity and transformation. Those who were dismissed only because of their class background or minor mistakes should be explained to that we were wrong in the past and reinstate them, or give them short-term training and reassign them to work. Second, each county must seize the time to convene meetings of incumbent primary school teachers, explaining that our policy and attitude towards primary school teachers is to cultivate, improve, and fully respect and trust them, solve their ideological concerns and practical difficulties, and stabilize their work morale. At the same time, it is necessary to publicize the spirit of teaching in the future to the masses, explaining that the policy is to cultivate students' cultural level, instill scientific knowledge, and then improve their specialized vocational knowledge. Therefore, asking teachers to only consider "poor peasant and hired peasant backbone" regardless of cultural level and teaching methods; only emphasizing so-called "vocationalization" and "labor concept" without improving culture; schools without a school system, no classes, and random behavior are all wrong. For the newly promoted teachers from worker and peasant backgrounds, we must strengthen their professional leadership and cultural learning, establish their prestige among the masses, and gradually make them the backbone of primary school teachers (It is wrong to make poor and illiterate peasants the backbone of primary school teachers is a joke - editor). Third, governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over education work, adjust education cadres and central primary school principals, and strengthen education and inspection of school work.

### 冀南行署指示小学教育  纠正左倾偏向  提高学生文化

    冀南行署指示小学教育
    纠正左倾偏向
    提高学生文化
    【冀南讯】今春以来，冀南各县小学教育工作中出现了某种程度的混乱现象。不少教员思想混乱，有的消极敷衍，“当一天和尚撞一天钟”，经常回家；有的怕犯错误，“多一事不如少一事”；有的认为教书没出路，想转业。学校和学生数目普遍减少，企之县去年小学有一百七十九处，今年减为一百四十九处；男女学生减少百分之六十。夏津周里长屯村，去年学生一百五十人，今年只有五十多人。其他各县也有类似现象。
    造成这种情况的原因：主要是在土改期间，某些地区犯了左倾错误，把干部中进行三查的一套，错误的搬到学校中，没有分清是非轻重，大批解职教员。据四专区十个县的统计，去年原有教员二千八百六十六名，去冬解职一千四百九十九名；邯郸市和邯郸县第四区解职教员三分之二。被解职的教员对我不满，留任的教员，感到教书无保障，消极怠工。因此，就不得不大量停办小学，新提拔的新教员，文化程度低，教学没经验，叫做“成份好没文化”，满足不了学生和群众的要求，入学儿童也大量减少。又经常使学生参加所谓社会活动与生产，也大大影响了学生的文化学习，有的一天只上一课，有的几天不上一课，一般的一年只念一本书，使群众感觉子女在校里学不了东西。有些小学发动贫雇学生斗争地富家庭出来的学生，毫无理由没收他们的书籍被服或拒绝他们入学，学生人数大量减少。
    冀南行署为纠正以上混乱现象，整顿与加强小学教育，特提出以下几点改进办法：第一，迅速纠正过去左倾冒险主义的错误，对过去被解职的教员，依据团结改造精神重新审查，对仅因成份关系或错误不大而解职者，应向他们解释说明过去是我们错了，将其复职，或予以短期训练再分配工作。第二、各县必须抓紧时间召开在职小学教员会议，讲明我们对小学教员的方针和态度是培养提高并十分尊重信任他们，解决其思想顾虑及实际困难，安定其工作情绪。同时要向群众宣传今后教学的精神，说明方针是培养学生文化程度、贯输科学知识并进而提高其专门职业知识。因此请教员只要“贫雇骨干”，不管文化程度和教学方法；只闹所谓“职业化”、“劳动观念”而不提高文化；学校没有学制，没有班次，随意乱来，都是错误的。对新提拔起来的工农出身的教员，要加强其业务领导与文化学习，在群众中树立其威信，使之逐渐成为小学教员中的骨干（这是错误的，让没有文化不识字的贫雇农作小学教员的骨干是开玩笑——编者）。第三、各级政府必须加强对教育工作的领导，调整教育干部与中心小学校长，加强对学校工作的教育与检查。
