Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 5th: Helsinki Dispatch: Since the latter part of last month, Finnish political parties have been negotiating to form a new cabinet after the general election. In order to ensure that the line of the previous cabinet would not be changed and that the interests of the working people would not be infringed, the People's Democratic Union demanded that the alliance must maintain five seats in the new cabinet, including the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, this reasonable demand was stubbornly opposed by the right-wing Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian League. They only agreed to give the People's Democratic Union four minor seats, such as the Ministry of Education. Negotiations thus reached a deadlock. Finally, the People's Democratic Union proposed forming a joint cabinet dominated by the two working-class parties, the alliance and the Social Democratic Party. However, Fagerholm, the leader of the Social Democratic Party who was tasked with forming the cabinet, did not respond and directly formed a uniparty cabinet on the 29th of last month. Of the 16 cabinet members, only Enckell, the re-elected Minister of Foreign Affairs, was non-partisan, and the rest were all Social Democrats. In response, Ms. Kuusinen and two other representatives of the People's Democratic Union parliamentary group issued a statement on the 30th of last month, pointing out that Fagerholm should be held responsible for the breakdown of the cabinet formation negotiations, and strongly criticized the new cabinet as "a cabinet of right-wing socialists supported by the right-wing camp."

    芬社会民主党破坏组阁谈判
    擅自组成一党内阁
    民联议会党团代表予以斥责
    【新华社陕北五日电】赫尔辛基讯：自上月下旬以来，芬兰各政党间即进行组织大选后的新内阁的谈判。人民民主联盟为求保证前内阁的路线不致被改变，劳动人民的利益不致受侵犯管，要求该盟在新阁中必须保持五个席位，并必须包括内政部长与外交部长在内。但这一合理要求遭到了右翼的社会民主党与农民党的死硬反对，他们只答应给人民民主联盟以如教育部之类的四个次要的席位。谈判因此陷入僵局。最后人民民主联盟提出组织以该盟与社会民主党两工人阶级政党为主的联合内阁，但受命组阁的社会民主党领袖法吉荷尔姆未予置答，即径自于上月廿九日组成一党内阁，全部阁员十六人中，仅连任外长之恩克尔为无党派人士，余均为社会民主党人。人民民主联盟议会党团代表库西宁女士等三人为此特于上月三十日发表声明，指出：法吉荷尔姆应负使组阁谈判破裂的责任，并力斥新内阁是“依靠右翼阵营支持的右翼社会党人的内阁。”
