What problems exist in mutual aid groups?
　　Good Industry Village Cadres Conduct In-Depth Inspection and Rectification of Mutual Aid
　　[Dispatch from this newspaper] Cadres of the Good Industry Village Production Committee in the third district of Licheng made specific divisions of labor, penetrating two mutual aid teams and two textile teams to conduct inspections, combining visits to understand thoughts and problems. After initially clarifying some situations and problems, they convened mutual aid and textile meetings, explaining the problems discovered during the inspection. This enlightened everyone, and they shared many facts about past mutual aid that did not align with their intentions. During the spring rectification of mutual aid, the Bu Xiang family's three laborers, originally within one mutual aid team, were assigned to three teams, affecting the Zhang family's unified production actions. Everyone was very dissatisfied with this phenomenon of hindering the principle of voluntary combination for the sake of being included in a team. They unanimously recognized that if mutual aid hindered the principle of facilitating everyone's joint development of production, the production enthusiasm of the team members would not be aroused. This was a major flaw in previous mutual aid efforts. Secondly, everyone raised the issue of unequal and unfair labor exchange in the past and many unresolved legacy issues. For example, during the autumn harvest and autumn plowing last year, the wages of six teams were not settled. Hu Qi said, "In the spring, it was stipulated that plowing three mu of land was equivalent to two workdays, but I plowed two mu of land and was also credited with two workdays." Everyone felt that the previous mutual aid was just unequal labor exchange, and this problem caused the most resentment. After everyone's inspection, each team, in addition to inspecting from the leadership's perspective based on mass opinions, focused on democratic discussion by the masses to resolve legacy issues and remove current obstacles to mutual aid. Team leader Zhao Muchen said during the inspection: "My main shortcoming is that I did not settle the accounts clearly for everyone, lacking leadership and democracy, and being selfish. Now, the wages for our team will be settled immediately, and the wages I owe will be cleared immediately." As other teams also launched mutual criticism, it was like "a stonemason chiseling, seeing results immediately." Only in this way can practical problems be solved, especially in clearing wages. Two methods were immediately determined: one was to clear the outstanding wages immediately, such as Hai Kui owing wages to Hai Liang; the other was to settle the accounts and then both parties voluntarily exchange labor to offset the debt, such as Shi Chunfa owing Wu Jishui 19.5 workdays. After settling the accounts, the two of them personally completed the labor exchange. Wu Jishui said, "As long as the accounts are settled, I just need you to repay the labor if I am short of labor." Hai Liang also said, "This way of solving it is not disadvantageous to anyone." After resolving the legacy issues, they summarized past achievements in mutual aid, further carried out education on organizing, and on this basis, conducted voluntary combination with leadership to improve mutual aid leadership and democratically elect team leaders. At that time, the masses unanimously proposed: This time, when participating in mutual aid, we must carefully consider and cooperate with teams that align with our intentions. Based on the demands of the masses, the leadership decided to allow completely free combination by the masses. As a result, two women's textile teams were disbanded, and six out of the eight textile team leaders in the village were re-elected. Eleven people voluntarily switched teams in the mutual aid teams, and three out of the eleven team leaders were re-elected. Everyone felt satisfied. Finally, a reasonable and fair method of equivalent value and a democratic leadership system were established. Hai Liang's team stipulated eleven points per workday, six points in the morning and five points in the afternoon, with more points for going early and fewer points for going late, based on the job, fair and reasonable. Li Kui democratically discussed the leadership system and arranged life. Everyone discussed and decided to hold regular meetings for criticism to avoid building up resentment.

　　互助里有些啥问题？
  　善业村干深入检查整顿互助
    【本行电】黎城三区善业村生产委员会干部具体分工，分别深入两个互助组，两个纺织组，结合访思想访问题进行检查，在一些情况及问题初步弄明后，即召开互助会及纺织会议，说明检查所发现的问题，启发了大家，谈出很多以前互助不合自己心思的事实。在春天整顿互助时，步香家原在一个互助组内的三个劳力，被编制到三个组里，影响了张家的统一生产行动。大家对这种为了编制在安组而妨碍了互助自愿结合原则的现象很不满意。一致认识到如果互助妨碍了便利大家共同发展生产的原则，组员的生产积极性便提不起来，这是以前互助存在的一个大毛病。其次，大家提出了以前换工不等价不公平和好多未解决的遗留问题，如去年秋收秋耕时，有六个组工资未清算，胡奇说：“春天规定犁三亩地顶两个工，给我犁了二亩地也顶了两个工。”大家感到以前的互助只是换工商不等价，这个问题使大家挽的圪瘩最多。经过大家这样检查，各组除吸收群众意见，从领导上进行检查外，便着重由群众民主讨论，解决遗留问题，扫除当前互助障碍。组长赵木辰检时候说：“我的缺点主要是没有给大家把帐算清，领导和民主，自私自利，现在咱组的工资当下就算，我欠的工资当下就清”。随着其他组也开展了互相检讨“石匠凿磨，马上见货”，只有这样才能解决实际问题，特别是清理工资，当即确定了两种办法：一种是存欠工资当下清理，海魁欠海亮的工资。一种是算帐后双方自愿以工还工，史春发欠吴计水十九个半工，算帐后他两人亲自把工兑通了。吴计水说：“只要把帐算通，我缺劳力你还我工就行”。海亮也说：“这样解决都不吃亏”。解决了遗留问题后，即总结以往互助成绩，进一步进行组织起来的教育，并在这基础上进行有领导的自愿结合，改进互助领导，民选组长。当时群众一致提出：这次参加互助可得好好思想思想，配合心事的组。领导上根据群众要求，决定完全由群众自由的结合。结果妇女纺织组散了两个，全村八个纺织组长改选了六个。互助组自愿互相跳组的十一个人，十一个小组长改选了三个。大家都感到满意。最后确定了合理公道的等价办法和民主领导制度。海亮组规定每工十一分。上午六分，下午五分，早去多顶迟去少顶。按活计工，公道合理。李魁民主讨论领导制度，安排生活，大家商议，定期开会检讨，以免结下心事。
