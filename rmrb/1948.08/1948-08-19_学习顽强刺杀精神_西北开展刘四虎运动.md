　　Studying the Spirit of Tenacious Bayonet Fighting
  　Northwest Launches the Liu Sihu Movement
    The Northwest Field Army of the People's Liberation Army is launching a bayonet hero "Liu Sihu Movement." The Sixth Company of this unit was the main attacking force in the battle of the southeastern heights of Wazijie, Yichuan. The second squad, led by Liu Sihu, was the company's assault squad. While charging towards the enemy's second hilltop, he closely followed the four hand grenades he threw and shouted, "Charge!" and rushed towards the enemy like lightning and thunder. He rushed up and kicked away a machine gun mounted on the fortification, caught up with it, and bayoneted an enemy. Amidst the sounds of artillery fire, he heard the enemy commander roaring, "Don't run! Anyone who runs will be shot!" Liu Sihu immediately dashed forward, and as soon as an enemy turned around, he quickly feinted a stab at the enemy's chest. The enemy deflected it with his gun, but before the enemy could retract his gun, he quickly and fiercely thrust his bayonet into the enemy's stomach. He then rushed forward again and stabbed another person carrying a backpack to the ground. Another enemy had just turned his body sideways when he stabbed him in the left arm, and the fifth stab hit an enemy's throat. In a matter of minutes, he successively stabbed four enemies to death and wounded several others.
    The enemy commander saw that only Liu Sihu was running ahead, and forced the scattered soldiers to surround him. A dozen enemies formed a circle five or six meters away from him; but everyone stared with frightened eyes, not daring to shoot, nor daring to approach him. Liu Sihu calmly held his gun, and whichever direction the bayonet pointed, the enemies there would immediately clear a path. While they were in a standoff, he vaguely heard someone calling from below; it was the voice of Squad Leader Shu Zhaoming. He immediately broke out of the encirclement. At this time, Squad Leader was engaged in hand-to-hand combat with an enemy. Liu Sihu rushed to help, regardless of everything. He used all his strength to stab the enemy hard, but because he used too much force, he fell into the narrow trench. The cowardly enemy took the opportunity to swarm up. He had already sustained four wounds to the head, but he still stubbornly resisted the enemy's bayonets. It was not until the follow-up troops rushed up and wiped out the enemy that Liu Sihu was covered in blood. When everyone helped him up, the first thing he cared about was asking, "How is Shu Zhaoming? Has he come down?" His tenacious fighting spirit in killing the enemy was praised by all the soldiers. At the battle mobilization meeting, the political commissar of the unit called on everyone to learn from Liu Sihu's spirit of tenacious hand-to-hand combat with the enemy and his responsible attitude in independent combat, and to use the Liu Sihu spirit as a standard to examine themselves. After the meeting, each company immediately conducted reading (Liu Sihu special issue) chats and discussions in squads and platoons, correcting the view of some soldiers that learning from Liu Sihu only meant killing four enemies on the battlefield like him. Everyone studied why Liu Sihu performed so well? It turned out that Liu Sihu was born into a poor family. His father was cheated by a wealthy man and hanged himself with a grievance. He served as an apprentice for six years, without earning a single penny. In 1946, he resolutely joined the People's Liberation Army and became an outstanding Communist Party member. During the Three Check-ups study, he tearfully recounted the persecution he suffered in the old society. He resolutely said: "I must serve the people to the end." Because he had a high class consciousness and a deep hatred for the enemy, he was brave in killing the enemy. Then, each company launched a conference to pour out grievances and seek revenge. After the Seventh Company poured out their grievances, the soldiers asked to take revenge, and a revenge group was formed, which immediately had eleven members. The next day, it grew to more than thirty people. Ninety percent of the soldiers in the company were involved in this movement, and three Liu Sihu groups and one Liu Sihu combat squad were successively established. The Fifth Detachment and the Machine Gun and Artillery Company launched a widespread signature and oath movement to learn from Liu Sihu, attracting a large number of soldiers to participate. Deputy Political Instructor Wang Denglu signed his name along with the soldiers. Gao Shenghou of the Fifth Company and Ma Shian of the First Squad of the Seventh Company, who had been timid in past battles, as well as Liu Zhongman, who was not enthusiastic about learning, all expressed their determination to change in the Liu Sihu movement and joined the Liu Sihu study group one after another.

　　学习顽强刺杀精神
  　西北开展刘四虎运动
    【新华社西北十一日电】西北野战军某部展开刺杀英雄“刘四虎运动”。该部六连在宜川瓦子街东南高地战斗中，担任主攻，刘四虎领导的二班是全连的突击班。在向敌人第二个山包冲锋时，他紧跟着自己投出去的四颗手榴弹，喊了一声：“冲！”便风雷电闪的奔向敌人。他冲上去一脚踢开了架在工事上的一挺机枪，赶上去一刺刀刺伤了一个敌人。在炮弹声中他听见敌指挥官吼叫着“不要跑！谁跑就枪毙谁！”刘四虎即飞奔向前，一个敌人刚转过身来，他迅速的向敌胸膛虚刺一刀，敌人用枪空拨了一下，他不等敌人收枪，很快的猛的一个突刺，刺进敌人肚子。他跟着又抢上去，又将一个背着背包的人刺在地上。另一个敌人刚斜转身子，他又刺进了他的左臂，第五刀刺中了一个敌人的咽喉。几分钟内，他接连刺死了四个敌人，刺伤好几个。
    敌指挥官见只有刘四虎一个人跑在前面，又逼着跑散的士兵将他围起来。十来个敌人在离他五、六米的地方，围成一个圆圈；但大家睁着恐慌的眼，不敢打枪，也不敢向他逼进。刘四虎沉着的端着枪，枪尖指向哪个方面，哪里的敌人便马上闪开一条道路。正对峙中，他隐约听到下面有人喊叫，是一班长舒照明的声音，他立即冲出了重围，这时一班长正和一个敌人肉搏，刘四虎不顾一切，急去援助。他用尽全力，狠狠给敌人一刺刀，但因用力过猛，跌进了狭窄的交通沟，胆怯的敌人乘机涌上。他头上已经负了四处伤，但仍顽强的抵抗着敌人的刺刀。直到后续部队冲上来，消灭了敌人，刘四虎全身都是血，大家扶起他时，他首先关心的问：“舒照明怎样了，下来了没有？”他这种顽强杀敌的战斗精神，得到了全体战士的赞扬。在战斗动员会上，该部政治委员号召大家学习刘四虎顽强与敌人肉搏的精神、及独立作战的负责态度，并以刘四虎精神为标准来检查自己。会后各中队即在班排里普遍进行读报（刘四虎专号）漫谈，展开讨论，纠正了部分战士认为学习刘四虎只是要和他一样在战场上拼死四个敌人。大家研究刘四虎为什么表现这样好？原来刘四虎是穷汉出身，父亲被老财欺诈得含冤上吊，自己侍候人家当了六年学徒，一个钱也没赚下。一九四六年，他决然地参加了解放军，并成为优秀的共产党员。三查学习中，他沉痛的哭诉了旧社会对他的迫害。坚决地说：“我一定要为人民服务到底。”因为他阶级觉悟高，对敌人有深刻仇恨，所以他杀敌勇猛。接着各连队展开了诉苦报仇大会。七连诉苦后，战士们纷纷要求报仇，成立报仇组，立即有十一人参加，第二天即发展到三十多人，全连百分之九十的战士，卷入这一运动，并先后成立了三个刘四虎小组，一个刘四虎战斗班。五分队、机炮连发起了学习刘四虎的广泛签名宣誓运动，吸收广大战士参加，副政指王登禄和战士们一道签了名。过去战斗中畏缩的五连高生厚，七连一班马世安，以及学习不起劲的刘中满，都在刘四虎运动中，表示了自己转变的决心，纷纷参加了刘四虎学习小组。
