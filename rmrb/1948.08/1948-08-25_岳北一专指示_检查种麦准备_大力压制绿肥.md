　　Yuebei First Special District Directive:
  　Inspect Wheat Planting Preparations, Vigorously Suppress Green Manure
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Yuebei First Special District Commissioner's Office directed its subordinates to immediately conduct an in-depth inspection of autumn production, with the focus on inspecting wheat planting preparations. It is required that wheat fields be plowed three times, with ample fertilization, and special attention should be paid to seed selection and soaking to prevent the occurrence of black and yellow dwarf diseases. The government has decided to allocate 3,000 shi of wheat seeds to expand wheat fields. The directive also requires all localities to hoe the autumn seedlings again, and universally pile soil around the seedling roots. After the White Dew solar term, green manure should be accumulated and suppressed, and artemisia and caltrop should be cut and scraped. The directive stated: These tasks should be completed while consolidating and developing mutual aid teams. Responsible comrades in each county should personally go deep into the lower levels. Work teams should also be organized to go to various districts and villages for inspection. Districts should use base points as units to help each village formulate practical plans, and based on these plans, inspect the extent of each village's implementation, helping them solve problems. Village cadres should divide their labor and participate in each team and neighborhood to provide leadership. Finally, it was pointed out: New model figures, model deeds, and experiences discovered in production should be disseminated in a timely manner, organizing the masses to "learn from the models"! However, it must be noted that this should not be a temporary flurry, but should be continuous. During the inspection, attention should be paid to overcoming the complacency of some cadres who believe that "production can proceed without leadership" due to the relatively good condition of the autumn seedlings this year. Help the masses solve various specific difficulties in production. In addition to the government issuing some loans, attention should also be paid to organizing mutual lending among the masses with interest, fully utilizing social idle funds to solve various difficulties in production.

　　岳北一专指示
  　检查种麦准备　大力压制绿肥
    【太岳电】岳北一专署指示所属立即深入检查秋季生产，重点应放在检查种麦准备工作。今天麦田要求做到犁三遍，多上粪，并应特别注意选种浸种，以防黑疸黄疸病害发生。政府决定调剂麦种三千石，扩大麦田。指示并要求各地把秋苗再锄一遍，苗根普遍拢起土堆。白露以后要积压绿肥，割蒿刮凌。指示称：这些工作应在巩固与发展互助组中去完成。各县负责同志，要亲自深入下层。并组织工作组分赴各区村检查。区应以基点为单位，帮助各村订出切合实际的计划，依据计划检查各村执行程度，帮助他们解决问题。各村干部要分工参加到各组各闾去进行领导。最后指出：生产中发现新的模范人物、模范事迹及经验，应及时传播，组织群众“向模范看齐”！但必须注意，不能轰一阵了事，要有经常性。检查中应注意克服部分干部因今年秋苗较好，而产生的“不领导也能生产”的自流思想。帮助群众解决生产中各种具体困难。除政府发放一部贷款外，还要注意组织群众有利息的互相借贷，充分利用社会游资，解决生产中各种困难。
