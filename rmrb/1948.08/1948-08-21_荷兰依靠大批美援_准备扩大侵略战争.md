　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 18th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the Dutch imperialists, with the support of US imperialist elements, are seeing their "peace talks" and "mediation" schemes in Indonesia gradually exposed due to the increased awareness of the Indonesian people. After gaining time through negotiations, Dutch imperialism is actively preparing for a new military aggression. According to a United Press report on August 7th, at the Batavia Conference hosted by the US, Australian, and Belgian "Mediation" Committee, the Dutch representative openly announced "the need to take necessary military actions" under the pretext of the "seriousness of the situation." The Indonesian representative accused: "Dutch aircraft continue to violate the ceasefire agreement by flying over the Republic of Indonesia, and the Dutch navy is provoking unexpected incidents." According to a TASS report from The Hague: On August 5th, a batch of 1,600 Dutch soldiers was transferred to Indonesia. The Dutch government decided to send a large number of troops to Indonesia in the second half of August. A message on August 6th stated that the Dutch authorities have been arresting Indonesian liberation movement activists on a large scale in various parts of Semarang, Java, for several consecutive days. On August 12th, TASS also quoted Indonesian sources as saying: "Reports from Yogyakarta indicate that the Dutch army is preparing to resume operations against the Republic." The ability of Dutch imperialism to resume its war of aggression against Indonesia is mainly due to the support of US imperialist elements. Sumitro, the Indonesian Financial and Trade Commissioner in Washington, told reporters on the 5th that the Dutch government is using funds obtained from the Marshall Plan to maintain more than 120,000 troops in Indonesia; the $600 million planned for the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan will be sufficient to maintain the current Dutch troops stationed in Indonesia for approximately two years. These serious facts have alerted the democratic parties and people of Indonesia. They are increasingly dissatisfied with the Hatta cabinet, which signed the Renville Agreement, sacrificing national independence and humiliatingly surrendering. According to a TASS dispatch quoting Indonesian news agency reports: On July 4th, the National Defense Committee, including representatives of major Indonesian political parties, was formed in Yogyakarta. On July 23rd, Indonesia had stopped the humiliating negotiations with the Netherlands on political issues. According to an Indonesian news agency report on July 28th reported by TASS: Under the leadership of the Indonesian Democratic Front, various parties put forward a national program advocating the consolidation of the Republic of Indonesia's defense forces, expanding Indonesia's diplomatic relations, improving the lives of the working class, and implementing land reform; the Indonesian government has approved this program; if this is true, it is naturally realized under the demands of the broad masses of the Indonesian people. All of this indicates that "the unity of the Indonesian people and their determination to resist the Dutch colonialists are growing" (Izvestia). After the breakdown of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations, in order to continue to deceive the Indonesian people, the United States sent Kirkland, the new head of the US delegation to the "Mediation" Committee, to replace Dubois on August 9th, and there was talk of putting forward a new plan.

　　荷兰依靠大批美援
    准备扩大侵略战争
    【新华社陕北十八日电】综合报导：荷兰帝国主义，在美帝国主义分子支持下，在印尼所玩弄的“和谈”与“调处”骗局，因印尼人民觉悟程度的增高，已逐渐被揭穿。荷帝国主义用谈判争取时间之后，正积极准备进行新的军事侵略。据合众社七日消息：在美、澳、比“调处”委员会主持的巴达维亚会议上，荷兰代表借口“情势的严重”，公然宣布“将采取必要的军事行动”；印尼代表则指斥：“荷兰飞机继续违背停战协定而飞临印尼共和国上空，荷兰海军已在挑动意外事件。”据塔斯社海牙报导：本月五日，有荷军一批一千六百人调往印尼。荷兰政府决定于八月下半月增派大批军队赴印尼。八月六日消息称：荷兰当局连日在爪哇的三宝垅各地大肆逮捕印尼解放运动分子。十二日塔斯社并引印尼消息称：“日惹得传荷军正在准备对共和国恢复作战”。荷兰帝国主义之能够重新进行对印尼的侵略战争，主要是美帝国主义分子的支持。印尼驻华盛顿财政及贸易专员索米特罗于五日告报界说：荷兰政府正在运用其在马歇尔计划中所得到的资金，在印尼维持十二万以上的军队；按照马歇尔计划拟给荷兰的六亿美元，将足够维持荷兰目前驻印尼的军队约达两年。这些严重的事实，警惕了印尼各民主党派与印尼人民。他们对于曾经签定丧失民族独立与屈辱投降的伦维尔协定的哈达内阁日益不满。据塔斯社电引印尼通讯社消息：七月四日，包括印尼各主要政党代表在内的国防委员会，在日惹组成。七月廿三日，印尼已停止与荷兰之间关于政治问题的屈辱谈判。根据塔斯社七月二十八日报导的印尼通讯社所传消息：在印尼民主阵线领导下，各党派提出了民族纲领，主张巩固印尼共和国国防力量，扩大印尼外交关系，改善劳动阶级生活，实行土改改革；印尼政府已经批准了这一纲领；如果这是事实，这自然是在印尼广大人民的要求之下实现的。这都表示“印尼人民的团结与反击荷兰殖民者的决心在增长着”（消息报）。荷印谈判破裂之后，为了继续欺骗印尼人民，美国于本月九日派出“调处”委员会美国代表团新任团长柯克兰来代替杜博斯，并有提出新方案之说。
