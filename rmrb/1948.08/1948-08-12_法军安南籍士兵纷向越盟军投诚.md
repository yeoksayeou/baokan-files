　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: TASS reported from a Viet Minh radio broadcast on July 27th that defections of Vietnamese soldiers from the French colonial army to the Viet Minh forces are becoming increasingly frequent. Recently, nine Vietnamese soldiers on the Bac Bo (transliteration) front defected to the Viet Minh side; prior to this, eight defected on June 13th, and another group of soldiers with 18 rifles defected in the same area on the 17th. On the 18th, 18 soldiers defected in Da Se (transliteration), and on the 20th, 33 defected in Cao Bang (northeast corner of Tonkin).
　　
　　In other news, Agence France-Presse revealed that Viet Minh troops have been constantly attacking the French colonial army for the past month. The French Marine Corps in the Saigon-Thi An area was subjected to several fierce attacks in late July. In mid-July, a French transport convoy was attacked on a route 100 kilometers from Saigon, resulting in eight French soldiers killed or wounded and eight trucks destroyed. On July 9th, twelve Viet Minh guerrillas attacked the "Shell Company" warehouse in Cam Xuyen (transliteration), a few miles from the Hanoi station.
