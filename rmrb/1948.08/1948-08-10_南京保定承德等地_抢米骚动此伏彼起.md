Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. According to incomplete reports from newspapers in Peiping and Tianjin: Under the threat of soaring grain prices and hunger, rice-looting disturbances continued to occur in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in July. On July 4th, over a thousand impoverished people in Chihkan City in southwestern Guangdong Province looted rice, affecting several streets of rice shops, taking away approximately 7,000 catties of rice. The rice-looting masses used sticks and stones to resist the suppression by the police and military police, lasting for three hours. On the same day, in Baoding, an isolated enemy stronghold on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, when enemy troops' grain carts passed through the city streets, fifty or sixty women swarmed forward, using sharp knives to pierce the rice sacks and snatch the grain, several of whom were arrested. Chengde residents are suffering from severe food shortages due to the Kuomintang's frenzied exploitation. In mid-July, when the Kuomintang used airplanes to drop grain to supply the enemy troops, starving people gathered in groups, holding cloth bags and抢 [qiang - could be interpreted as spears or just a general holding device], and did not retreat even when the enemy troops fired warning shots. According to an Associated Press report: On July 30th, citizens in the Zhonghua Gate area of Nanjing smashed two Kuomintang grain distribution stores because of fraudulent practices during distribution. It is reported that during the price surge in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in June, rice-looting disturbances occurred successively in eight places, including Ningbo, Wujin, Chongqing, and Wuxi.

    南京保定承德等地
    抢米骚动此伏彼起
    【新华社陕北七日电】据平、津报纸不完整材料报导：在粮价飞涨与饥饿威胁下，七月间国民党统治区继续发生抢米骚动多起。七月四日，广东省西南部赤坎市千余贫民抢米，波及数街道米店，抢去大米约七千斤。抢米群众以棍棒、石头反抗警察宪兵镇压，历三小时之久。同日平汉线北段敌孤立据点保定，当敌军某部运粮大车经过市街时，妇女五、六十人一拥而上，以利刃刺破米袋抢走粮食，其中数人被捕。承德居民在国民党疯狂搜刮下粮荒严重，上月中旬国民党以飞机投掷粮食接济敌军时，饥民成群手持布袋和抢，敌军鸣枪威胁亦不稍退。另据美联社讯：七月三十日南京中华门一带市民，捣毁国民党粮食配售店两家，原因为该两店配售时舞弊。按在国民党区六月涨风中，宁波、武进、重庆、无锡等八地曾先后发生抢米骚动。
