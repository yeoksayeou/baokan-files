　　Linking Checks on Work
  　Improving Policy Thinking
  　Cadres in Shijiazhuang's Seven Districts Strive to Learn
    [Shijiazhuang News] Cadres in the seven districts of Shijiazhuang, while studying the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Party Consolidation Work in the 1948 Land Reform" and the "Current Tasks of the North China Liberated Area," are linking this to checks on their work, improving their policy thinking. Everyone has generally reflected that in the past, they failed to correctly grasp policies on certain issues, causing great losses to their work. During the land reform movement, due to a lack of clarity that the purpose of land reform was to develop production, they excessively emphasized taking care of the lonely and widowed with land, which resulted in some land being left barren. For example, in Wang Village, Wang Renrong's family, consisting of a mother and son, with the son doing business in Shijiazhuang, the mother alone was allocated four and a half mu of land, more than double the village average of two mu. Because there was no labor to cultivate it, the land was not well planted. When issuing agricultural loans, there was much talk about the village lending 2.08 million yuan, which was divided equally among 196 poor and lower-middle peasant households. Liang Yujin from Chengjiao Village received special care because he was poor, receiving a loan of 120,000 yuan, but he lost 70,000 yuan of it gambling. Similar situations were numerous, so the agricultural loans were not fully used for production. After initial study and checking, many cadres have realized the importance of improving their policy level and are now continuing to actively study the documents. (Yuan Chao)

　　联系检查工作
  　提高政策思想
  　石市七区干部努力学习
    【石家庄讯】石市七区干部在学习“中共中央关于一九四八年土改对整党工作的指示”及“华北解放区当前任务”两大文件中，联系检查工作，提高干部政策思想。大家一致反省出过去在某些问题上未能正确掌握政策，使工作受到很大损失。在土改运动中，由于不明确土改的目的是发展生产，过分强调以土地照顾孤寡，结果反而使得一些土地荒芜了。如王村王任荣家有母子二人，儿子在石市经商，他妈一人分地四亩半，全村平均数为二亩，超过一倍还多，因无劳力耕种，地都未好好种上。在发放农贷时，大谈村贷款二百零八万元，由一百九十六户贫农和下中农平均分了。程角庄梁玉金因穷受到特别照顾，一人贷款十二万元，结果耍钱输了七万元。类似这种情况还不少，使农贷并未完全用于生产。经过初步的学习与检查，许多干部都认识到提高政策水平的重要，现正继续积极努力学习文件。（袁潮）
