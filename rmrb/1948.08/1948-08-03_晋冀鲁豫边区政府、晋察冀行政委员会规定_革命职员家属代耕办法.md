    [This Newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee jointly issued an order on July 21 regarding the issue of substitute farming for the families of revolutionary staff and workers, stipulating: 1. Families of revolutionary staff and workers who have a certain amount of labor power or a certain occupation and are able to maintain their livelihood shall not be allowed to request substitute farming for their land. 2. Families of revolutionary staff and workers who are able to maintain their livelihood but cannot cultivate their land due to a lack of labor power may lease their land or hire laborers to manage it, and shall not be allowed to request substitute farming. Leasing land or hiring laborers to cultivate land shall not be regarded as exploitation. 3. If the families of revolutionary staff and workers are in extreme financial difficulty and lack labor power, and if leasing land or hiring laborers to manage it truly cannot maintain their livelihood, they may, upon request and with the approval of the district office, appropriately adopt the method of substitute farming for the families of revolutionary soldiers to provide substitute farming for a portion of their land, or substitute farming for the main labor portion of a portion of their land. 4. The families of village cadres shall not be allowed to request substitute farming under any circumstances. Any previous substitute farming measures that are inconsistent with these regulations shall be nullified.

    晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀行政委员会规定
    革命职员家属代耕办法
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会于七月二十一日联合发出关于革命职员家属土地代耕问题的命令，规定：一、革命职员家属有一定劳动力或一定职业、足能维持生活者，其土地一律不得要求代耕。二、革命职员家属能维持生活，但因没有或缺少劳动力、不能耕种其土地者，得将其土地出租或雇工经营，不得要求代耕。其出租土地或雇工经营耕种土地者，不以剥削行为论。三、革命职员家属生活极端困难，没有或缺少劳动力，如以土地出租或雇工经营，确实不能维持其生活者，得经本人请示，区公所批准，酌量采用革命军人家属代耕办法予以代耕一部土地，或代耕其一部土地之主要劳动部分。四、村干部家属，一律不得请求代耕。前此代耕办法与此规定不合者，一律作废。
