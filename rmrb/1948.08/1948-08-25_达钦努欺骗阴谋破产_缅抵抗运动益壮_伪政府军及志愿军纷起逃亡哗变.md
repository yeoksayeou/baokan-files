Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 23rd: Comprehensive reports indicate that the rapid development of the Burmese people's resistance movement has exacerbated the military and political crisis of the Rangoon government, fostered by British imperialism. To cope with this serious situation, Prime Minister Thakin Nu announced a fifteen-point so-called "left-wing unity plan" on May 25th, aimed at "dissolving" the Burmese Communist Party, disbanding the Volunteer Army and the Socialist Party, attempting to deceive the people with a "Marxist" and "left-leaning" facade, and saving his increasingly isolated and disintegrating precarious rule. However, this trick did not deceive the people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party into laying down their weapons, but instead aroused opposition from the Volunteer Army, one of the main pillars of the ruling Freedom League. The Volunteer Army issued a declaration pointing out that the civil war was due to the government's oppression of the Communist Party, and demanded that the government first stop "suppressing the Communists" before negotiating with the Communist Party. After the Thakin Nu government refused the army's demands and arrested large numbers of its personnel, many Volunteer Army units mutinied and launched armed resistance, occupying the cities of Danawa, Kaiyang (southeast of Rangoon), and Prome (west of Rangoon) near Rangoon. The people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party have recently bravely launched attacks, capturing Saymyo (transliteration) northwest of Rangoon (Agence France-Presse, 11th); cutting off the railways and inland river traffic on the periphery of Rangoon (United Press, 12th). Large numbers of Burmese government troops have deserted and mutinied. Three hundred regular army soldiers stationed in the suburbs of Rangoon have deserted with their weapons and joined the Communist forces operating north of the city. Conservative estimates from authoritative sources in London are that approximately 4,000 soldiers of the Burmese government's regular army and military police have deserted (Agence France-Presse, 14th). According to a report from the British United Press in London on the 18th: "Despite the Burmese government's claims of victory over the 'rebels' in the past week, news from Rangoon still indicates that Burmese government officials are surprised by the rapid expansion of the Burmese resistance movement. London admits that the Burmese government seems to be losing its foothold in most parts of Burma. The Burmese government's administrative power cannot effectively reach beyond Rangoon and Mandalay. Two battalions of the Burmese army have mutinied and have joined the resistance movement along with some police units. Even the president's own guard recently rebelled against the government and joined the resistance army. Rangoon is virtually under martial law. Obstacles have been erected on the roads leading to Rangoon, police stations have been converted into fortresses, and a night curfew has been imposed."

　　达钦努欺骗阴谋破产
    缅抵抗运动益壮
  　伪政府军及志愿军纷起逃亡哗变
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合报导：缅甸人民抵抗运动的迅速发展，使英帝国主义卵翼下的仰光政府的军事政治危机日益严重。为了应付这种严重情势，总理达钦努曾于五月二十五日发表了旨在“溶化”缅共、解散志愿军与社会党的十五条所谓“左翼团结方案”，企图假“马克思主义”的“左倾”面貌来欺骗人民，挽救其日益孤立与分崩离析的垂危统治。然而这个诈术，并没有骗取缅共领导的人民武装放下武器，却激起当政的自由同盟主要支柱之一的志愿军的反对。志愿军曾发表宣言，指出内战是由于政府压迫共产党，要求该政府先停止“剿共”，然后和共产党谈判。志愿军许多部队在达钦努政府拒绝该军的要求和大批逮捕该军的人员之后，纷起哗变和武装反抗，并占领了仰光附近的城市丹瓦、开阳（在仰光东南）及普罗姆（仰光西）。由缅共领导的人民武装最近更勇敢的进行出击，攻克仰光西北的萨页缪（译音）（新法社十一日电）；切断了仰光外围的铁路与内河交通（合众社十二日电）。缅甸政府军队则大批逃亡与哗变。驻仰光市郊的正规军士兵三百人已携械逃亡，并加入在该市以北活动的共产党队伍。伦敦权威方面保守的估计是：缅甸政府的正规军及宪兵已逃亡者共约四千人（法新社十四日电）。据电通社伦敦十八日电称：“尽管缅甸政府扬言在上星期内战胜了‘叛军’，但来自仰光的消息仍显示，缅政府人士对于缅甸抵抗运动的迅速扩展感到惊讶。伦敦方面承认，缅甸政府似乎正在丧失其在缅甸大部分地区内的立足点。缅政府的行政力量实际上不能到达仰光及曼德勒之外。缅军两营已哗变，并已与若干警察部队一起参加抵抗运动。甚至总统自己的警卫队最近也起而反抗政府并参加抵抗军。仰光实际上已处在戒严状态之下。通向仰光城内的路上，已矗立起障碍物，警察所已转装成堡垒，夜间戒严已实施。”
