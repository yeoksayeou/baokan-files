　　The locust plague and other insect pests that spread from Pinghan to Daoqing across seventeen counties have achieved great success through a mass-based locust eradication and crop protection campaign. As of now, insect pests in seven counties, including Linxian and Tangyin, have been completely eradicated, and most of the other counties have been eradicated. A correspondent of the branch agency summarized this locust eradication campaign as follows: The rapid victory of this locust eradication campaign is primarily due to the timely discovery and organization of the masses to fight the locusts by leaders in various localities, which broke the masses' paralysis, waiting mentality, and various ideological obstacles, and prompted them to take swift action while conducting education at all times and in all places. Initially, many people thought that "grasshoppers are not a big deal, they will die after a rain," and some even considered them "divine insects" and were afraid to fight them, burning incense and offering paper instead. When leaders in various localities discovered this kind of thinking among the masses, they immediately convened mass meetings to announce the local autumn crop damage, recall the locust plague of 1943 and the victory of locust eradication, break the above-mentioned ideological obstacles, and inspire their confidence in locust eradication. After Wangzhang Village in the first district of Xiuwu County discovered locusts, the masses thought it was not a big deal, so Ren, the deputy district chief, led the masses to a severely affected field for practical education, which greatly shocked everyone. They universally formulated locust eradication plans and quickly took action. In the process of eradicating locusts, some people only fought locusts in their own fields and did not work together with others, driving the locusts into other people's fields; or when they went to other people's fields to fight, they did not protect their crops, so the locusts were killed, but the seedlings were also trampled. Nanlingyang in Linxian County discovered this phenomenon and immediately proposed: "Grasshoppers jump everywhere, everyone's seedlings are hard to protect. If everyone just looks after themselves, everyone will suffer; organizing together is the best way to eradicate locusts." "Fighting grasshoppers is to protect seedlings, don't trample on the seedlings." After this kind of education, the masses carried out planned and organized fighting, and eliminated most of the grasshoppers in four mornings. Secondly, leading cadres in various localities took action themselves and promoted the leading role of the vast number of village cadres. When locusts were discovered in Shangma Village in Xiuwu, they were dealt with perfunctorily, and they were dealing with the superiors in a perfunctory manner, some fought and some didn't. When Zhao, the district chief, discovered this phenomenon, he explained to the masses: You are fooling yourself, and you will suffer the loss. At the same time, he personally went to the fields to fight. When the masses saw this, they said: "The district chief is still fighting, it's not right for us not to fight, who is he doing it for?" The next day, the number of locust eradicators increased from twenty or thirty to more than one hundred. The chief of the third district of Tangyin personally went to Shiyutai to mobilize the masses to eradicate locusts, and 583 people killed 735 kilograms in one day. After the county secretary of Shexian County, Shi Ziming, and the district secretary of the sixth district, Xue Changqing, discovered locusts in Xida, they immediately led the masses to actively eliminate them, and they were all eliminated in a few days. In some villages in Anyang, Linxian, Tangyin, and other counties, some cadres did not understand the party rectification policy, were afraid of making mistakes, and dared not actively lead, so locust eradication fell into a state of drift, and the fields suffered some losses. When the leaders discovered this, they put forward the slogan of actively and boldly leading the masses to eradicate locusts and "performing meritorious service for the people." This brought into play the enthusiasm of the vast number of village cadres. The village chief of Dongnao Village in Nanyang led 150 men and women and saved 500 mu of autumn seedlings in one day, which was supported by the masses. Thirdly, Party, government, and civil organizations at all levels established locust eradication committees from top to bottom to provide unified leadership. The main responsible cadres at all levels served as chief and deputy commanders, with power and responsibility, intelligence organizations, and the ability to grasp the situation, mobilize forces in a timely manner, and carry out the locust eradication struggle in an organized and leadership. For example, Anyang's seventh district, which discovered the locust plague the earliest, mobilized 11,320 men and women to participate in locust eradication after establishing locust eradication command posts at all levels. In just one week, the entire district's locust plague was completely eliminated, saving more than 15,000 mu of autumn seedlings. South of Matoujian and north of Shangxia Hai Liu Jia Wei Jian in Anyang's ninth district, 2,000 mu of autumn crops were damaged. The district locust eradication command post immediately mobilized more than 1,600 people from the nearby Jiangjiaqiao and other four villages to support Matoujian, killing more than 700 kilograms of locusts in half a day. Fourthly, timely commendation and criticism aroused the enthusiasm of the masses to eradicate locusts. Wang Quanfu, a peasant who turned over a new leaf in Hanlinjian, the second district of Tangyin, mobilized his entire family to participate in locust eradication. He told his family that both his own land and other people's land must be protected. As long as there are no locusts in everyone's fields, his own land will be safe. His family was selected as a model family in the village in this locust eradication campaign. Under his influence, the whole village worked harder. After Anyang County government achieved victory in locust eradication in the seventh district, it issued a circular on July 13 to commend the district cadres who led the locust eradication. The district also congratulated 53 locust eradication heroes. The masses were in high spirits, and the cadres also quickly turned to leading the masses to replant. The village cadres of Xincun Village in the second district of Xiuwu not only did not lead everyone to fight, but also did not allow their family members to participate, so the locust eradication in the village fell into a state of drift. After being inspected and criticized by the county and district, they changed their work style and killed more than 500 kilograms of grasshoppers in four days, and proposed not to stop until the grasshoppers were completely eliminated. In addition, the method of mutual challenge competition and exchanging locusts for millet also had a stimulating effect. In terms of locust eradication tactics, the two methods of encirclement and fire attack were commonly adopted in various localities. Encirclement means tightly surrounding the land with the most locust damage on all sides, compressing it into one place, and then extinguishing it. Fire attack means lighting a big fire at night, the locusts rush towards the fire, and the four sides surround and press, and all are cremated. When fighting, it is best to use early morning, because the locusts are not easy to fly with dew. In order to protect the autumn seedlings, some villages set rules, and some villages sent women and children to wastelands to fight, in order to reduce damage to the fields.

　　太行各级干部领导得力
  　十七县蝗虫大部剿灭
    【太行电】由平汉而道清蔓延十七县的蝗灾及其他虫害，经过群众性的灭蝗保苗运动，取得很大成绩。截至目前止，林县、汤阴等七县虫害已全部扑灭，其他各县则大部扑灭。分社记者综述此次灭蝗运动称：此次灭蝗运动如此迅速的取得胜利，首先在于各地领导上及时发现，及时组织群众扑打，打破了群众的麻痹等待心理及各种思想障碍，迅速行动起来，并随时随地进行教育。最初许多群众认为“蚂蚱不要紧，一下雨就会死”，还有的认为是“神虫”，“越打越多”，所以烧香送纸不敢扑打。各地领导上发现群众这种思想，即召开群众会，宣布当地秋禾遭害情形，回忆一九四三年的蝗灾和剿蝗胜利，打破上述思想障碍，启发其灭蝗的信心。修武一区王张村发现蝗虫后，群众认为不要紧，该区任副区长即领着群众到一块被害最严重的地里进行实际教育，使大家大吃一惊，普遍订出灭蝗计划，迅速行动起来。在剿蝗中有些人光打自己地里的蝗虫，不和大家合伙干，打起来就往别人的地里赶；或者到别人地里打时不爱护人家的庄稼，结果蝗虫打了，苗也踏坏了。林县南陵阳发现这种现象，即提出“蚂蚱本是到处跳，谁的小苗也难保，各顾各，都倒霉；组织起来好剿蝗”，“打蚂蚱为保苗，别把小苗踏坏了”。经过这样教育，群众即进行有计划有组织的扑打，四个早晨将大部蚂蚱消灭。其次是各地领导干部亲自动手，并且发扬了广大村干部的领导作用。修武上马村发现蝗虫，敷衍了事，应付上级，你打他不打。该区赵区长发觉这种现象，即向群众说明：自己哄自己，自己要吃亏，同时亲自下地扑打。群众见了说：“区长还打哩，咱不打可不对，人家是为谁哩？”第二天剿蝗人数由二三十个增加到一百多。汤阴三区区长亲自到石玉台发动群众剿蝗，五百八十三个人一天就打了七百三十五斤。涉县县书师自明、六区区书薛长庆于西达发现蝗虫后，立即领导群众积极扑灭，不几天即全部消灭。安阳、林县、汤阴等县，有些村庄的部分干部对整党政策不了解，怕犯错误，不敢积极起来领导，剿蝗陷于自流，田禾遭到一些损失。领导上发觉了，即提出积极大胆领导群众剿蝗，“为民立功”的口号。发挥了广大村干的积极性。南阳东垴村长领导了男女一百五十个人，一天就救活了五百亩秋苗，得到群众的拥护。第三、各地党政民自上而下的成立了剿蝗委员会，统一领导。各级主要负责干部任正副指挥，有权有职，有情报组织，掌握情况，及时调动力量，有组织有领导的开展了剿蝗斗争。如发现蝗害最早的安阳七区，在成立起各级剿蝗指挥部后，即动员了一万一千三百二十个男女参加剿蝗，不过一个礼拜，即将全区蝗害扑灭净尽，救活了一万五千多亩秋苗。安阳九区马头涧以南、上下海刘家苇涧以北，有两千亩秋禾被吃坏，区剿蝗指挥部即调动了附近的江家桥等四村一千六百多人支援马头涧，半天灭蝗七百多斤。第四、及时表扬与批评，鼓起群众积极灭蝗的情绪。汤阴二区韩林间翻身农民王全福，动员了全家男女参加剿蝗，他告诉家里人说：自家和别家都要打，只要大家地里没有了，自家地也会光的；他家在这次剿蝗中被全村选为模范家庭。在他影响下，全村人干的劲头更大了。安阳县府在该县七区剿蝗胜利后，特于七月十三日通令表扬领导剿蝗的区干部；该区亦为五十三位剿蝗英雄贺了功；群众情绪很高，干部也迅速转入领导群众补种。修武二区信村村干部不但不领导大家扑打，且不让家里人参加，该村剿蝗陷于自流。经县区检查批评后，即转变了作风，在四天内打了五百多斤蚂蚱，并提出不消灭完蚂蚱不停止。此外相互挑战竞赛，拿蝗虫换小米的办法，也发生了刺激作用。在剿蝗战术上，各地普通采取了围攻火攻两种办法，围攻即是在蝗害最多的地里四面紧围，向一地压缩，然后加以扑灭。火攻则是在黑夜点起大火，蝗虫迎火扑来，四面围住一压即全部火葬。扑打时则多利用早起，因有露水蝗虫不易飞奔。为了保护秋苗，有的村订了纪律，有的村把妇女儿童放到荒地去打，以减少田苗伤毁。
