Xinhua News Agency, North China, 25th: According to a report in the Tianjin New Star on July 1st, workers in the various Shanghai China Textile Company factories, owned by the bureaucrat capitalist Song Ziwen, unable to maintain their livelihoods due to soaring prices, successively launched a conscious anti-hunger movement at the end of last month to demand improved treatment from the factories. Workers at the 17th factory, at midnight, as the factory staff and foremen were having a late-night meal, swarmed into the dining hall to搶eat the food. On the 27th, the workers presented five demands to the factory: (1) Each person should receive a loan of 500,000 yuan; (2) In accordance with the treatment of private factories, each person should receive a monthly subsidy of two *dou* of white rice; (3) The factory should provide meals for all workers once a day; (4) Each person should receive a wage increase (referring to base salary) of 0.3 yuan; (5) Each person should be issued a set of work clothes. By noon the next day, the factory authorities had not yet responded to the workers' demands, and the workers gathered more than a hundred people to stage a demonstration preventing the foremen from entering the machine room to eat. The situation gradually escalated, and other factories of the company also began to brew concerted action. Among them, the 3rd, 4th, 10th, 12th, 14th, and 19th factories of China Textile have successively responded and launched similar movements in their respective factories. In addition, more than two hundred workers at the Shanghai East China Textile First Knitting Factory, unable to bear the hunger, also planned to respond to the movement, and a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's police have entered the factory to suppress them. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 15th, the Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau announced that the workers' cost of living index for July increased by 95% compared to the previous month, which is 1.38 million times that of the pre-war period. According to the recent Shanghai rice price (more than 40 million yuan per *dan*), the index has reached more than 4 million times that of the pre-war period, and the actual income of workers has been drastically reduced by more than two-thirds. According to the Associated Press, the workers are extremely dissatisfied that the wages they receive according to the cost of living index are far from sufficient for actual living expenses.

    沪中纺各厂工人
    掀起反饥饿运动
    【新华社华北二十五日电】据天津新星报七月一日消息：宋子文官僚资本的上海中纺公司各厂工人因物价狂涨，无法维持生活，于上月底先后掀起自觉性的反饥饿运动，借以要求厂方改善待遇。该公司第十七厂工人于当日午夜十二时，当该厂职员及领班开夜餐之际，蜂拥冲入饭厅抢吃饭菜。二十七日该厂工人向厂方提出五项要求：（一）每人借支五十万元；（二）依照民营工厂待遇，每人每月津贴白米二斗；（三）厂方对工人一律每天供给膳食一次；（四）每人加工资（指底薪）三角；（五）每人发给工衣一套。迟至次日午间，该厂当局尚未答复工人要求，工人即集合百余人举行阻止机器间领班进膳的示威。事态渐趋扩大，该公司其他各厂亦均纷纷酝酿采取一致行动。其中中纺三厂、四厂、十厂、十二厂、十四厂、十九厂已先后响应，于各该厂内掀起同样运动。又沪东中纺第一针织厂二百余工人因不堪饥饿，亦拟响应该项运动，大批蒋记警察已进入该厂镇压。另据美联社十五日沪电报导：上海蒋记市政府社会局该日宣布七月份工人生活指数较上月增加百分之九十五，即为抗战前的一百三十八万倍。按最近上海米价（每担四千万元以上）指数已为抗战前的四百多万倍，工人实际收入已激减三分之二以上。据美联社称：工人们以按生活指数所领得的工资远不敷实际的生活费，而极为不满。
