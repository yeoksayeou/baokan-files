Kang Chouzi Captures Sixteen Enemies in One Go

[Pingbao Frontline Electric Dispatch] On the morning of July 16th, during the battle to liberate Laishui City, Kang Chouzi, a soldier of the Second Company of a certain unit, discovered an enemy in the green seedling field on the right side of the road. At this time, Kang Chouzi was not holding anything in his hand, so he chased after him alone. After chasing him, he saw more than a dozen enemies crawling in the green seedling field. He shouted, "Disarm!" The enemies saw that he was alone and had no gun in his hand, so they all said, "Who's going to disarm for you!" He cleverly pointed in one direction and shouted, "Set up the machine gun over there!" At this time, the enemies believed him and panicked. Kang Chouzi took advantage of the situation and leaped forward a few steps, snatching three rifles from the enemy. Seeing that the guns were still loaded, he raised his gun and ordered the enemies, "Don't move! I'll shoot you if you move again." The frightened enemies surrendered their guns. At this time, he felt that he couldn't handle more than a dozen prisoners and so many weapons by himself. So he fired three shots into the sky. The comrades searching for the enemy in other places, hearing the gunshots, rushed over. At this time, Kang Chouzi smiled victoriously at everyone. He captured a total of sixteen prisoners and seized one light machine gun and twelve rifles.

    单人徒手·有智有勇
    康丑子一次俘敌十六名
    【平保前线电】七月十六日晨，解放军攻克涞水城战斗中，某部二连战士康丑子，在大道右边青苗地里，发现了一个敌人。这时，康丑子手里什么也没有拿着，便只身追过去了。追过去后，又看见青苗地里爬着十几个敌人。这时，他大喊“缴枪！”敌人一看只他一个人，手里又没有枪，便齐说：“谁缴给你枪！”他机警的紧接着指着一个方向又喊：“那边的机枪架起来！”这时，敌人信以为真，便慌了起来。康丑子乘势向前跃进了几步，抢了敌人三支步枪，一看枪上还压着顶门子，便举枪向敌人命令说：“不准动！再动打死你们。”吓的敌人把枪都缴了。这时，他感觉到十几个俘虏，又有这许多武器，一个人没法处理。于是便向天空放了三枪。在其他地方搜索敌人的同志，一听枪声，便一齐赶了去。这时康丑子向大家胜利的微笑了。他一人共捉了十六个俘虏，缴了一挺轻机枪，十二条步枪。
