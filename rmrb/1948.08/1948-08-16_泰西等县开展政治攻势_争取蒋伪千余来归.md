　　【Jilu Yu Electric Dispatch】Tai'an County in Western Shandong has achieved significant results in launching a political offensive. From June 1st to June 20th, within twenty days, 720 Chiang Kai-shek puppet personnel returned home. They brought with them six machine guns, one American-style submachine gun, 183 rifles, 21 pistols, and 14,130 rounds of ammunition. The County Committee summarized the experience of this period, stating: (1) They corrected the cadres' retaliatory thinking and correctly grasped the lenient policy. (2) They seized the opportunity of enemy and puppet wavering, panic, and disorder after our military victories, concentrated their efforts, and focused on launching a mass disintegration and persuasion campaign. (3) They held mass meetings and meetings of puppet family members, posted notices, and publicized our Party's lenient policy. (4) They educated puppet family members, urging them to call their sons and husbands home. (5) They educated the returned puppet organization personnel, encouraging them to persuade their comrades, which proved very effective.

　　【Another Electric Dispatch】Since its establishment on April 25th, the Changyuan "Chiang Army Personnel Reception Center" has accommodated a total of 342 fleeing Chiang Army soldiers by July 20th. Liu Shanglun and three other soldiers from a platoon of the Feicheng puppet brigade's special service company brought with them one submachine gun, two rifles, and over 300 rounds of ammunition. The reception center issued them bonuses in accordance with regulations. On the 19th of last month, Song Ziming, the squad leader of the Third Squad, First Platoon, Ninth Company, Third Battalion, First Regiment, 213th Brigade of the enemy's reorganized Second Division, led six soldiers, including Zhu Liangyong, carrying one light machine gun, three rifles, and 940 rounds of ammunition, to defect. In addition to issuing bonuses and travel expenses, the reception center also wrote certificates of proof to send them home.

　　【Another Electric Dispatch】Since our capture of Dakou, over 200 puppet organization personnel in Ningyang County have returned home and repented. Zhou Xianfang, Zhou Zizheng, and others brought with them 32 guns and 315 rounds of ammunition.

　　【Chahar Electric Dispatch】Under the influence of our political offensive and the victory of the Pingbao Campaign, the number of escaped households and puppet soldiers returning in Pingxi Lai Zhuo and Wanping is increasing daily. Before the start of the campaign, Lai Zhuo County launched a political offensive, widely publicizing our Party's lenient policy and carrying out persuasion and disintegration work through the family relations of escaped households and militia members. Combined with the victorious influence of the Pingbao Campaign, escaped households returned in droves. According to statistics from eleven villages in the sixth and seventh districts in July, a total of 76 escaped households, 21 puppet militia members, one Chiang soldier, one policeman, and one security team member were persuaded to return. After returning to their hometowns, they were settled and cared for by district and village cadres and the masses, and they all had housing and land and have begun production to establish their homes. In total, no fewer than 200 households of escaped households and puppet militia members have been persuaded to return in all counties. The masses from the fifth district of Wanping who had been encircled by the enemy to Mentougou have also returned to their hometowns one after another. From the beginning of July to the 20th, over 50 people have returned. The democratic government specially allocated them some relief grain to solve their current livelihood and production difficulties. After fifteen people from Baidaozi returned, the district government immediately convened a meeting to understand their difficulties, and 300 jin of millet was given to them on the spot as relief. The villagers also highly promoted mutual assistance and friendship, helping them find houses and furniture. These returnees were all very happy. The government is now helping the returnees to raise buckwheat seeds and start reclaiming wasteland for planting buckwheat.
