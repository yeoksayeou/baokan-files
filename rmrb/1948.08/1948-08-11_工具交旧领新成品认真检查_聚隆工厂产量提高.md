[Ji Zhong News] The Julong Iron Factory in Xinji City has greatly improved its production efficiency by implementing the spirit of the Industrial and Commercial Conference. The Julong Iron Factory convened a meeting of party members and all personnel to educate them on our party's industrial and commercial policies, reward those who were active in production, and criticize those who were passive. It also proposed improving the work system, determining the exchange of old tools for new ones, registering damage and additions, distributing raw materials and finished products on time, and conscientiously implementing finished product inspections. Everyone was required to comply with work hours, reduce absenteeism, and insist on calculating work based on the finished products produced by each person each day. It was stipulated that the group leader should be in charge of the issuance of tools and raw materials for the group, the inspection of finished products, supervise the group's production, create production plans, and help educate trainees. Trainees were called upon to respect their masters, obey the group leader, be enthusiastic about learning, and improve their skills. Party members were called upon to actively take the lead in production. After mobilization, education, and democratic discussions among the workers, everyone's production enthusiasm was even higher. Production efficiency has greatly improved: the foundry and carpentry groups used to produce at most one waterwheel a day; now they can produce one and a half. The coal stove group's screw production increased from 100 screws a day to 150 screws a day. Zhao Jingui of the foundry group used to make 60 waterwheel carriers a day, but now he makes more than 100.
