    【Taihang Electric】 The TaiGu Democratic Government's implementation of our Party's lenient policy has garnered enthusiastic support from Yan's puppet personnel and all sectors of society. When our government entered the city, it immediately issued a proclamation stating that all unarmed Yan's puppet personnel and Yan's puppet officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons would not be arrested. Puppet government personnel, village chiefs, civil defense forces, and members of the "Comrades Association" hiding in the city went to the county government to register one after another. In just ten days, from July 14th to 24th, more than two thousand people registered voluntarily. Many puppet village chiefs, under the influence of our government's policy, began to repent and asked to atone for their crimes. The puppet county magistrate and commander of the civil defense force, after Yan's bandit regulars were routed on the night of the 12th, disbanded his subordinates and fled to Qi County. Finding nowhere to go, he returned to TaiGu and hid. Three days later, seeing that our lenient policy was indeed not one of killing or detention, he gathered his deputy commander, secretary, and seven or eight attendants and voluntarily registered with our government. More than seventy employees of the puppet county government's land and food department, the service department, the police station, and other agencies handed over all land and food archives, various files, buried assets, and the existing 10,000 stone of military wheat and 100,000 jin of military grass to our democratic government for reception. The quartermaster personnel of Yan's bandit 9th Column who had not had time to escape reported several secret warehouses, containing many boxes of various shells, light and heavy machine guns, and a number of rifles and pistols. Wang Dongli, one of the heads of the Chiang bandit Kuomintang TaiGu County Party Department and principal of the Third Central Elementary School, after learning about our Party's policy, repented that he had been deeply poisoned by Chiang and Yan's anti-communist ideology in the past and had gone astray. He applied to our government to announce his withdrawal from the Kuomintang, requested a statement in the newspaper, and publicly exposed all the Kuomintang branches and members in the city's schools under his leadership. Some members of Yan's bandit secret service organizations, the Comrades Association, the Progressive Society, and the Liaison Office, etc., hearing that our army was approaching Yan's bandit lair in Taiyuan, felt that their past crimes of opposing communism and opposing the people were profound and wished to jump out of the fire pit as soon as possible. They also handed over the city's secret service personnel organizations and secret service personnel under their leadership by name for the government to handle. After Yan's bandits fled north, a total of more than a thousand puppet dependents residing in TaiGu registered with the government's Public Security Bureau and various street offices. Many puppet family members, carrying the old and the young, waited in front of the county government or the Public Security Bureau every day, inquiring about the prisoners sent back from the front, searching for their husbands or sons. They also pleaded with the government to take care of the release of their sons or husbands when our army captured Taiyuan so that they could return home and reunite as soon as possible. Our government, adhering to its lenient policy, resettled all registered puppet personnel and their dependents separately. Officers and soldiers who surrendered their arms and unarmed personnel who declared that they would no longer engage in sabotage or disrupt public order were treated leniently. More than 400 puppet personnel who wished to reside in the city were introduced by the government to various streets and allowed to settle down and engage in production. Those who had homes to return to were given subsidies for dismissal, with each person receiving 44 taels of millet per day for travel expenses. Those who voluntarily continued to work were also appropriately arranged. There were still hundreds of households of dependents of Yan's bandit officers and officials who had died in battle, fled north with Yan's bandits, or fled elsewhere, who had been left behind in the city, and the government provided them with appropriate resettlement to enable them to engage in production and self-help. The more than 700 medical and miscellaneous personnel in the Bandit 27th Field Hospital abandoned by Yan's bandits have been appropriately resettled by the government according to their wishes. Among the 1,800 wounded soldiers of Yan's bandit army, mostly peasants who had been forcibly conscripted, were the most difficult to deal with; however, our government still provided them with treatment. Those who had homes to return to and could walk on their own were given travel expenses to return home for recuperation, and those who were seriously injured and could not walk were helped to inform their families to come and visit. Those who had no homes to return to were being dispersed and resettled. A number of seriously injured people whose homes were in various counties in central Shanxi were transferred back to their villages by government vehicles. Currently, all kinds of puppet personnel and puppet dependents in the city have settled down in their respective occupations and admire the wise policies of our Party and the democratic government.

　　太谷伪员在我宽大政策感召下
    自动登记各安生业
    【太行电】太谷民主政府贯彻我党宽大政策，获得阎伪人员及各界热烈拥护。当我政府入城时，即颁布一切非武装阎伪人员及放下武器之阎伪官兵均不逮捕之布告，城内隐藏之伪政府人员、乡长、民卫军、“同志会”会员，均纷纷前往县府进行登记。仅七月十四日至二十四日十天中，自动登记的即达两千余人。许多伪乡长，在我政府政策感召下开始悔悟，请求赎罪。伪县长兼民卫军司令，当十二日夜阎匪正规军溃窜后，即解散部下向祁县窜逃，因走头无路，折回太谷隐藏起来。三天以后看到我宽大政策确实不杀不扣，就把他的副司令、秘书及随员七、八人找来，自动到我政府登记。伪县府田粮处、差务处、警察所等机关职员七十余人将全部田粮档案，各种卷宗、掩埋资财及现存之万石军麦，十万斤军草，全部交我民主政府接收。未及逃走之阎匪九纵队留守军需人员，报告了秘密仓库数处，内有各种炮弹多箱，轻重机枪及长短枪一部。蒋匪国民党太谷县党部负责人之一、第三中心小学校长王东理，自认识我党政策后，悔悟过去受蒋阎反共毒化很深，误入歧途，向我政府声请宣布退出国民党，要求登报声明，并将其领导之城内各学校国民党支部及党员全部公开。阎匪特务组织同志会、进步社及联络处等人员一部，闻我大军已直逼太原阎匪老巢，自觉过去反共反人民的罪恶深重，愿早日跳出火坑，亦将其领导下之城内特工人员组织及特工人员等具名交出，听候政府处理。阎匪北逃后，居留太谷之伪眷属共达千余户，向政府公安局及各街公所履行登记。许多伪属携老扶幼，每天等候在县府或公安局门前，询问由前方送回之俘虏，寻觅是否有其丈夫或儿子。并恳请政府在我军打下太原时，关照释放他们的儿子或丈夫，使能早日回家团聚。我政府一本宽大政策，将所有登记之伪员及其眷属分别安置。解除武装之官兵及非武装人员声明再不进行破坏扰乱治安者，均宽大处理。愿在本城居留之伪员四百余，已由政府介绍各街准予安家生产。有家可归者资助遣散，每人每日发给路费四十四两小米。自愿继续供职者亦酌情进行安置。确已战死或随阎匪北逃或逃亡他处之阎匪军官、官员遗留在该城的眷属，尚有数百户，政府均予适当安置，使其生产自救。被阎匪遗弃之匪二十七野战医院中七百余医杂人员，政府已按照其自愿适当安置。其中一千八百名阎匪军之轻重伤员，多为强迫抓来之农民，最难处理；但我政府仍给以治疗，有家可归能自己行走者，发给路费返家休养，伤重不能行走者，代其转达家人前来接探，无家可归者正设法分散安置。有一部重伤而家在晋中各县者，均由政府拨车沿村转送还乡，现该城各种伪员伪属均已各安生业，对我党及民主政府之贤明政策甚为钦仰。
