    Border Region Government Cadres
    Inspect Document Study
    [This newspaper dispatch] After the joint office of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, the two directly subordinate Party committees, in order to stabilize certain ideological fluctuations among the cadres of the organs (such as whether there would be job transfers, etc.), began in late June to study "Lenin on How Soviet Government Employees Should Work," "Preface to the Re-publication of 'Left-Wing' Childishness," and this text along with the 1937 document "How to Analyze Classes." By early July, the study process in each unit had generally gone through the following three steps: First, familiarize themselves with the spirit of the documents, individual reading, and collective discussion of the issues in the documents. Second, connect the inspection to the work of the organs and to themselves. The inspection revealed the following main problems: 1. There is a phenomenon of procrastination in work. For example, the radio station feels that it is not as important as the troops, and it doesn't matter if it is delayed by half an hour; there is nothing to inspect in terms of mass viewpoint in technical work. The reports from below to the Agriculture and Forestry Department last year are still unopened. It takes a month to write an instruction, and it is outdated when it is written. The Civil Affairs and Education Department has not registered the honored revolutionary veterans and martyrs well, and the receiving and dispatching room has held letters for several days without sending them out (this is extreme bureaucracy). 2. The purpose of investigation and research work is unclear. For example, some investigation materials of the Civil Affairs and Education Department are only sorted out after returning, and have not played a role in guiding the work. This is the problem of investigation being divorced from the intention of the leadership, and becoming investigation for the sake of investigation. 3. In the past, the division of responsibilities was not clear enough, the work lacked initiative and planning, and one only did what was assigned; the indoor materials could not be systematically kept and used, and one would grab a handful and rush for a while when needed, and discard them after use, often without paying attention to sorting them out for future use, lacking a scientific work style. Some comrades also examined individualism and status consciousness, feeling that life in the lower-level organs was not as good, that work was casual, and that they were unwilling to do administrative and technical work in the organs, feeling that promotion was not as fast as working at the lower levels, etc. Third, after the inspection, systems are established accordingly, such as the division of labor, material storage, registration, and other systems have been established. Some comrades in the Civil Affairs and Education Department also put forward suggestions for the entire government work, such as responsible cadres should personally go to various places to inspect the work, and the government agencies should be streamlined, etc.

    边府机关干部
    学习文件检查工作
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会联合办公后，两直属党委会为安定机关干部思想上某些波动（如工作是否会有调动等），从六月下旬开始学习“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”，“重印左派幼稚病前言”及本文与一九三七年“怎样分析阶级”等四个文件。至七月初，各单位学习过程大致经过以下三个步骤：第一，先熟悉文件精神，个人阅读，集体讨论文件上的问题。第二，连系检讨机关工作与自己。检查中发现以下主要问题：一、工作上有拖拉现象。譬如电台觉得没有在部队上重要，拖一半个钟头没关系；作技术工作在群众观点上没有什么可检查。农林处去年下面来的报告还有没拆封的。一个指示写一个月，写好也过时了。民教处对荣军烈士没有很好登记，收发室有压住信好几天送不出去的（这是何等官僚主义）。二、调查研究工作目的不明。如民教处有些调查材料只是回来整理一下，并未在指导工作上发挥作用，这是调查脱离领导意图，变成为调查而调查的毛病。三、过去分工负责不够明确，工作缺乏主动性计划性，交一点作一点；室内材料没能有系统的保管使用，用着时抓一把忙一阵，用过后一丢，常不注意整理备用，缺乏科学的工作作风。有的同志还检查了个人主义，地位观念，觉得没有下级机关生活好、工作随便，不愿作机关事务技术工作，觉得没有在下边工作提拔快等等。第三，检查后随着树立制度，如工作分工、材料保管、登记等制度已建立起来。民教处有的同志并提出对整个政府工作的建议，如负责干部应亲赴各地检查工作，政府机构应该精简等。
