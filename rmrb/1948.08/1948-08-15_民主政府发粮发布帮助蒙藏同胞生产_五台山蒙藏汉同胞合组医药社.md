　　Democratic Government Distributes Grain and Cloth to Help Mongol and Tibetan Compatriots with Production
　　Wutai Mountain Mongol, Tibetan, and Han Compatriots Jointly Form a Medical Cooperative

　　[Our Dispatch] There are a total of ninety-six Mongol and Tibetan compatriots living in Wutai Mountain, of which thirty-one are residents and sixty-five are lamas and nuns. In the past, they mostly relied on donations from Inner and Outer Mongolia for their livelihoods. Now, due to the Fu bandit's obstruction of the Ping-Sui Railway, the source of donations has been cut off, and their lives have become very difficult. The democratic government is extremely concerned about them. In April, it distributed 16,420 catties of relief grain to them. In May, it distributed sixty-three bolts of cloth, and also adjusted a portion of land, providing seeds on credit to encourage them to learn agricultural production. With their food, clothing, and production taken care of, they are deeply grateful and all wish to stay on the mountain and "live a happy life." After the Qingming Festival, they planted 1,425 trees. In order to reward their production, the government issued one catty of rice for each tree, and they gradually established the concept of labor. Zhao Sawa, a Mongolian lama from Luohou Temple, cleared all the grass from the temple and planted yellow mustard. Now the courtyard is full of yellow flowers, which can produce one hundred catties of mustard seeds. Shuangnapangcuo, a Tibetan from Qinghai in Shifangtang, feeds two cows on the forest pasture, and two calves have been born. He is very happy. (Wen Zhao)

　　[Our Dispatch] Under the advocacy of Deputy Director Ma of the Agricultural Department of the Beiyue Administrative Office, the Mongol and Tibetan compatriots of Wutai Mountain jointly formed the Mongol, Tibetan, and Han Medical Cooperative with the local Han people on May 1st. A cooperative committee consisting of seven people, including Mongolian Buyun Dalai, Tibetan Luozeng Nima, and Han Zhou Guan, was formed to lead the organization. The administrative office provided a loan of 1.35 million Hebei banknotes to support the establishment. The cooperative has one Mongolian and one Han doctor, and one veterinarian, and has cured many diseases for the Mongol and Han people. At the end of June, the cooperative sent out four purchasing agents to organize the masses to dig up medicinal materials in four locations in Wutai Mountain: North Peak, South Peak, Central Peak, and Garden Ridge, and sell them to the Ji'min Pharmacy in the border area. In a month and a half, the masses dug up and sold a total of 5,931 catties of Artemisia anomala, Gentiana macrophylla, Astragalus membranaceus, Polyporus umbellatus, Cannabis sativa, and Angelica pubescens, earning 5,697,000 yuan (Hebei banknotes). As a result, it has gained the support of many people. (Wen Zhao)

　　民主政府发粮发布帮助蒙藏同胞生产
    五台山蒙藏汉同胞合组医药社
    【本报讯】住在五台山的蒙藏同胞共有九十六人，其中有三十一人是居民，六十五人是喇嘛尼姑。他们过去多靠内外蒙布施为生，现因傅匪阻隔平绥线，布施来源断绝，生活大感困难；民主政府对他们异常关切，四月里给他们发救济粮一万六千四百二十斤，五月份又发布六十三匹，并调剂一部土地，贷给种子叫他们学习农业生产。衣食生产得到照顾，他们深为感谢，均愿留山“乐度一生”。清明后他们栽活一千四百二十五棵树，政府为奖励他们生产，每棵发米一斤，他们逐渐树立起劳动观念。罗猴寺蒙古喇嘛赵萨娃，把寺院的草都拔光，种上黄芥，现在黄花满院，能打芥子一百斤。十方堂青海藏人双纳旁错在林牧场上伴喂两个母牛，已生下两个牛犊。他非常欢喜。（文昭）
    【本报讯】五台山的蒙、藏同胞，经北岳行署农业厅马副厅长倡导，于五月一日与当地汉民共组蒙、藏、汉医药社。由蒙人布云达赖、藏人罗增尼马、汉人周官等七人组成合作委员会领导。行署贷款合冀钞一百三十五万元扶助开办。社内有蒙汉医生各一人，兽医一人，已为蒙汉人民治好许多疾病。该社并于六月底派出四个采购员，分别在五台山的北台、南台、中台、花园岭等四处组织群众刨药材，卖给边区济民药店。一个半月，群众刨卖蒿本、蓁艽、黄芪、猪苓、神麻、独活等共五千九百三十一斤，获利五百六十九万七千元（冀钞）。因此得到不少群众的拥护。（文昭）
