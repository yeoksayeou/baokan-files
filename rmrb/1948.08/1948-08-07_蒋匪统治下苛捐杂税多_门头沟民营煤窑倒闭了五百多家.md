[Chahar Electric Dispatch] Under the oppression and exploitation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit regime, coal mines in Mentougou, one of North China's famous coal mining areas, have been closing down one after another, and the people's lives are miserable. Of the more than 600 large and small coal mines originally in Mentougou, only about 30 are still struggling to operate. The other more than 500 have closed down one after another due to the unbearable oppression of exorbitant taxes and levies, the squeeze of bureaucratic capital, and the skyrocketing prices. Hongshun Mine was one of the larger mines in Mentougou. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits extorted 100 taels of gold from the mine, assigned 25 conscripted laborers, and demanded 18 civilian laborers from the mine every day (the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stipulated that each conscripted laborer could be replaced with 30 million to 70 million Chiang coins, and each civilian laborer with 170,000 Chiang coins). A battalion of bandit troops was stationed at the mine, eating and drinking freely, and took all the timber from the mine to build fortifications. The mine, unable to withstand the oppression, was forced to close down. Currently, only the Sino-British Mine, opened by the Chiang family bandit gang, dominates Mentougou. The remaining private coal mines are all complaining incessantly. The owner of the Dongxinfang ×× Mine said: "My mine produces a total of twelve or thirteen tons of coal day and night. Last year alone, military service and donations cost more than 55 million yuan (Chiang coins, same below). This time, they want six more conscripted laborers, which will cost 300 million yuan to replace. Selling my children and wife wouldn't be enough. If I open it, I can't afford it! If I don't open it, they won't allow it. Truly, if Old Chiang isn't overthrown, no one will have a good life."

The local masses have completely lost their freedom under the control of the bandits. Since May 12th, women have been forced to stand guard at various street posts, checking pedestrians. People must carry "National Identity Cards," "Passes," "Labor Certificates," and "Refugee Certificates" when they move around, and those without them may be arrested at any time. It costs 5,000 yuan to buy a pass to work in the fields, and a pass to leave the village costs 10,000 yuan. The endless conscription has caused terror and unease among the people. Since June 1st, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have again demanded one soldier from each "jia," and if people don't hand over the person, they have to pay money, which is 30 million to 75 million yuan per person. The common people had just finished paying the first time, and the second order was issued, resulting in the masses losing both people and money. Many workers who came from other villages to work in the coal mines were betrayed by secret agents. In three days, 350 people were arrested and taken to concentration camps.

    蒋匪统治下苛捐杂税多
    门头沟民营煤窑倒闭了五百多家
    【察哈尔电】华北著名煤矿之一的门头沟，在蒋匪统治压榨下，煤窑纷纷倒闭，人民生活痛苦不堪。门头沟原有大小煤窑六百多座，现仅余三十多家勉强开工，其他五百多家均因不堪苛捐杂税的压榨，官僚资本的排挤及物价飞速上涨而先后倒闭。宏顺矿是全门头沟较大的一个，蒋匪曾向该矿讹索黄金一百两，派壮丁二十五人，每天向该矿要民夫十八个（蒋匪规定每个壮丁可以三千万到七千万蒋币代替，每个民夫以十七万蒋币代替）。匪军一营经常驻在该矿坐吃，并将矿上所有木料拿去修了工事。该矿不堪压榨，被迫关门歇业。现仅有蒋家匪帮开设的中英矿在门头沟独自称霸，其他仅余的私营煤窑均叫苦连天。东辛房××窑窑主说：“我那个窑一昼夜共出煤十二、三吨，去年一年出兵出捐就花去五千五百多万元（蒋币，下同），这次又要六个壮丁，得用三万万元去代替，这样卖了孩子老婆也不够。开吧，贴不起！不开，又不让。真是老蒋不打倒，谁也好不了。”
    当地群众在匪徒控制下完全失去了自由。自五月十二日开始，妇女们被逼到各街站岗，检查行人。人民行动必须带有“国民身份证”、“通行证”、“劳工证”、“难民证”等，没有的随时可能被逮捕。每到地里作活得花五千元买一个通行证，出村的通行证得一万元。无止境的抓丁更造成人民的恐怖和不安。从六月一日开始，蒋匪又向每甲要兵一名，不交人就交钱，每个人是三千万到七千五百万元。老百姓刚交齐了第一次，第二次又派下来了，结果闹得群众人财两空。不少外村来下煤窑的工人，多被特务出卖，三天中就有三百五十人被抓到集中营。
