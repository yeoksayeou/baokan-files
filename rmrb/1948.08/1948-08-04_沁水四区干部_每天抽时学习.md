    Qingshui Fourth District Cadres
    Set Aside Time Each Day to Study
    [Taiyue Electric] The Qingshui Fourth District work group and cadres have begun to earnestly study the Four Documents. At the cadres' meeting on July 18th, they examined their past laxity in study. Comrades Yang Wuhong and Wang Guanhua said in their self-criticisms: "In the past, when I read the newspaper, I only looked at the Enquiry Office and the Voices of the Masses on the fourth page, and didn't look at anything else." Farm association cadre Comrade Chai Changlin said: "When I saw the reprinting of the second chapter of 'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder, I thought it might be a good method for treating illness, but since I'm not sick, what's the point of reading it?" Comrade Ren Tiangui said in his self-criticism: "I'm in the township all day long, and I always feel like I don't have time, so I don't study. Now I feel like I've fallen behind." After self-criticism, everyone began to realize the importance of study and resolved to study earnestly. They also stipulated that in addition to self-study and reading every morning, they would combine the reporting of work every week with collective study for one day in the base point village in the sub-district. (Note: The Four Documents are the CCP Central Committee's 1948 work instructions, "The Current Tasks in the North China Liberated Area" (People's Daily inaugural editorial), the preface and text of the reprinting of the second chapter of "Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, and "Lenin on How Soviet Functionaries Should Work.") (The method of the Qingshui Fourth District work group in resolving the contradiction between cadres' work and study is relatively practical and appropriate, and is worthy of emulation by other regions – Editor)

    沁水四区干部
    每天抽时学习
    【太岳电】沁水四区工作组和干部开始认真学习四大文件。七月十八日的干部会上，他们检讨了过去学习松懈的毛病。杨五洪、王官虎二同志检讨时说：“我过去看报只看第四版的问事处和群众呼声，别的都没看。”农会干部柴长林同志说：“我看到重印左派幼稚病第二章时，心想可能是治病的好方法，咱又没病，看他作甚？”任天贵同志检讨说：“我一天价在乡里，总觉着没时间，就不学习，现在才感到圪夹回来了（退步的意思）。”经过检讨，大家开始认识学习的重要，下决心认真学习。并规定除每天早上自修自读外，每星期结合汇报工作，在小区基点村集体学习一天。（按：四大文件为中共中央一九四八年工作指示，华北解放区当前任务（人民日报创刊词），重印左派幼稚病第二章前言及本文，列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作。）（沁水四区工作组解决干部工作与学习矛盾的手法，比较实际妥善，值得各地仿效——编者）
