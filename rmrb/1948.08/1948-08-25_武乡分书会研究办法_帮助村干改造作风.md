　　Taixing Electric Message: The Wuxiang District Committee Secretary and District Chief joint meeting from August 2nd to 5th made a special check and discussion on how to help village cadres establish a new work style in future work. Everyone unanimously believed that the simple task-oriented view and simple administrative command style of some village-level cadres in Wuxiang were historical. The generation and development of this style were inseparable from the bureaucratic style of leadership that only gave work tasks, did not provide concrete help and inspection, and did not regularly educate and improve their awareness. For example, when sorting out village finances last winter, Li Guitang, the secretary of the Cuyu branch in the third district, reported sorting out 100,000 yuan and was severely criticized by the district secretary. Within five days of returning to the village, he sorted out another 700,000 yuan and was immediately praised by the district. However, the district did not check how the work was completed or whether there were any deviations. As a result, the task was completed, but the masses were very dissatisfied. Since the rectification campaign, especially after the county's cadre expansion meeting, most village cadres have truly realized that the masses strongly oppose their poor work style, and that they must change in the future, but they lack new work styles and experience and feel distressed. Therefore, two deviations have arisen in the current work of village cadres, which urgently need specific help and correction: one is being restrained, not proactive, and not daring to take bold responsibility, so nothing can be done; the other is still the old style of simple commands. The discussion resulted in the stipulation that district cadres should be specifically assigned according to their work ability to lead one to two villages, and that helping village cadres establish a new work style should be regarded as one of the work tasks. When assigning work to village cadres, not only should the work tasks, significance, and purpose be explained, but also specific methods for completing the work should be studied, distinguishing between urgency and importance, what to do first and what to do later, and how to combine them, with clear arrangements. Provide concrete help during the process, but avoid substitution and ensure the initiative and enthusiasm of the people. Inspections and summaries should be conducted at any time to gradually improve their work ability and establish a new work style. In important work, district cadres should personally grasp and lead. If it is to be completely handed over to village cadres, it must be implemented under two conditions: first, experience has been gained in a task; second, village cadres can truly and correctly grasp the policy; otherwise, they cannot blindly let go, resulting in deviations.

　　武乡分书会研究办法
  　帮助村干改造作风
    【太行电】武乡在八月二日至五日的区委书记、区长联席会上，对今后在工作中怎样帮助村干部树立新的工作作风，作了专门的检查与讨论。大家一致认为武乡某些村级干部的单纯任务观点与简单的行政命令作风，是带有历史性的，这种作风的产生和发展形成，又和领导上只给工作任务，不去具体帮助与检查，不经常教育提高其觉悟的官僚主义作风分不开。例如去冬整理村财政时，三区村峪支书李贵堂汇报整理出十万元，受到区书严厉批评，回村没五天，就又整理出七十万元，立刻受到区上表扬。至于工作怎样完成，是否有偏向？却不去检查。因而任务完成了，群众却非常不满。整党以来特别是县的扩干会后，大部分村干部已真正体会到由于自己作风不好群众很反对，今后非转变不行的道理，但新的工作作风与经验又很缺乏，感到苦恼。因此在村干部当前工作上产生了两种偏向，急需具体帮助与纠正：一种是束手束脚，不主动，不敢大胆负责，因而什么工作也搞不起来；一种仍是简单命令的老作风。讨论结果规定区干应按工作能力强弱程度具体分工，领导一村至两村，把帮助村干部建立新作风当成工作任务之一。给村干部布置工作时，不但要讲明工作任务、意义和目的，特别要研究出一些完成工作的具体方法，分清缓急大小，先做啥后做啥及如何结合，明确安排。在进行中加以具体帮助，但要避免代替包办，以人民群众主动性与积极性。并应随时检查总结，以逐渐提高其工作能力，树立新的工作作风。在重要工作上、区干部应亲自掌握与领导，如要完全交给村干部，必须在两个条件下才能实行：一是一件工作已取得经验；二是村干部真正能够正确的掌握了政策，否则便不能盲目放手，致产生偏向。
