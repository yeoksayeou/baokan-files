　　CCP North China Bureau Party School
  　Biases and Experiences in Learning
    The first phase of the CCP North China Bureau Party School's study of the current situation has concluded. Based on the summary materials from the Third Branch, the main biases and experiences gained in the previous stage of learning are introduced below for reference in study elsewhere:

    I. Biases and Shortcomings:
    (1) During discussions, some groups did not focus their attention on the central topic, and most of the time was taken up by some nouns, common knowledge, historical stories, etc. For example, breaking down the three words "turning point" and investigating them in isolation, asking what is "turning"? What is "folding"? What is "point," etc. (2) Discussions often tended toward empty speculation, circling around time and numbers. For example, when will the war be won? When will we reach Nanjing? (3) Discussions could not be fully linked to reality, and there was a dogmatic learning method. For example, some comrades specialized in reciting textbooks, holding materials such as "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" in their hands, speaking in a set manner, without combining it with the actual situation in the country and the enemy and our forces, analyzing and understanding, and without grasping the core of a problem to move horizontally and in depth. (4) Some comrades cannot elevate specific practical problems and cannot elevate to a comprehensive understanding of problems. (5) The discussion topics issued by the leadership are often the requirements of the superiors for everyone, rather than the problems that everyone urgently needs to study and answer. (6) There was not enough general speaking, and it was not possible to properly arrange for those comrades who spoke more to help those who did not dare to speak or could not speak. At discussion meetings, there was often silence after a comrade with a higher theoretical level had spoken. (7) Not enough mutual assistance and mutual learning. (8) Poor prior deliberation and inconsistent steps. Often the topic was announced only at the meeting. The speed and content of discussions were not uniform across groups.

    II. Several Experiences:
    (1) In learning, it is first necessary to oppose the erroneous ideology of empiricism. Individual comrades are unwilling to study the international and domestic situation and do not want to study political theory. They believe that only land reform needs to be studied, and that these situations and politics are irrelevant to land reform. They personally "experienced" that they could do land reform without studying these things before. This narrow and erroneous empiricist thinking must be overcome. It should be explained that land reform is closely related to the overall political situation and political tasks. Without looking at the overall situation and without studying political and ideological issues, one will inevitably fall behind, and land reform will certainly not be done well. At the same time, it is also necessary to oppose dogmatic learning and oppose the view of being divorced from reality and underestimating reality. (2) During discussions, the branch leadership must conduct timely summaries, explain nouns, and provide materials. (3) When assigning learning tasks, it is necessary to determine what viewpoints to promote and what viewpoints to oppose according to the requirements of the learning plan. Universally implement it among comrades and specifically grasp it in learning, so that the learning plan and learning requirements can be implemented. (4) To solve a problem of ideological viewpoint, it is necessary to study several fundamental issues, or gradually study them, to understand it. It is useless to circle around fragmented, minor, and superficial issues. (5) At the end of each learning stage, there must be a comprehensive summary, and the erroneous and biased views in the discussion should be criticized. (6) Wall posters and challenges are good ways to promote each learning stage. (7) Disputes can be held to make the issues clearer. (8) When linking to reality, attention must be paid to the combination of the specific and the general. And the specific and the general should avoid being too fragmented or empty and dogmatic. (9) Inspire free thought, and explain or criticize incorrect opinions in the summary.

    III. Methods of Studying Documents:
    (1) Combine careful reading of documents with discussion. When reading documents (collectively or individually), pay attention to raising questions in each paragraph, then discuss them, and then look at the documents or reference books. (2) Deliberate separately and discuss collectively. (3) For the discussion topics raised by the superiors, the branch committee members and group leaders should first spend considerable time studying, unifying their understanding of the spirit of the document and the scope it includes, and then explain it to all comrades, so that it is easier to grasp the center and avoid detours. (4) Chat and test anytime, anywhere. Raise questions from the paragraphs of the document and have the other party answer. If the answer is not correct or not perfect, supplement and explain it again. Opinions can also be exchanged in a casual manner during game time. The purpose is to help each other thoroughly understand the problem, but be careful not to deliberately make it difficult for people. (5) Spending too much time reading documents and too much content will make everyone mentally exhausted and bored. Discussion should be entered appropriately. (Kai Ya, Chen Bohong)

### 中共华北局党校　学习中的偏向与经验

　　中共华北局党校
  　学习中的偏向与经验
    中共华北局党校第一阶段关于目前形势的学习已经结束。现根据三支部的总结材料，把上一阶段学习中的主要偏向和已得的经验介绍如下，供各地学习时参考：
    一、偏向和缺点：
    （一）讨论时有个别小组没有把注意力放在中心题目上，大部时间被一些名词、常识、历史故事等占去。如把转折点三个字拆开来孤立的追究，什么叫转？什么叫折？什么叫点等。（二）讨论中往往偏于空洞的推测，在时间上，数字上打圈子。如什么时候战争胜利？什么时候打到南京？（三）讨论与实际不能完全联系起来，有教条主义的学习方法。如有些同志专门的背书本，把“目前形势和我们的任务”等材料拿在手里发言，照说一套，没有和国内形势，敌我各方面的实际情况结合起来，分析理解，没有把握住一个问题的核心向横度及深度去推移。（四）有些同志不能把具体的实际问题提高一步，不能提高到全面去理解问题。（五）领导上发下来的讨论题往往是上边对大家的要求，而不是大家所迫切需要研究和解答的问题。（六）普遍发言不够，未能把发言多与不大发言的同志适当安排，没有很好的启发、帮助那些不敢发言、不会发言的同志。讨论会上往往在一个理论水平较高的同志说过后，一直哑然无声。（七）互相帮助互助学习作的不够。（八）事先酝酿差，步骤不一致。往往在开会时才宣布题目。各组进行速度和讨论内容不统一。
    二、几个体验：
    （一）学习中首先要反对经验主义的错误思想。个别同志不愿学习国际国内形势，不要学习政治理论。他认为只学习土改就行了，那些形势、政治与土改无关。他亲身“体验”到以前不学习这些东西同样可以做土改。这种狭隘的错误的经验主义思想必须克服。应说明土改是与整个政治形势、政治任务密切联系的，不看全局，不学习政治思想问题，就必然会使自己落后，土改一定作不好。同时也必须反对教条主义的学习，反对脱离实际和轻视实际的观点。（二）讨论中支部领导上必须及时进行小结，解释名词，供给资料。（三）布置学习任务时，必须根据学习计划的要求，确定提倡什么观点，反对什么观点。在同志中普遍贯彻，并在学习中具体掌握，这样才能使学习计划学习要求贯彻实现。（四）解决一个思想观点问题，必须通过几个原则问题的研究，或逐步研究才能搞通，只在零碎的、次要的、表面的问题上打圈子是无济于事的。（五）每个学习阶段结束时，必须有全面的总结，把讨论中错误的偏差的见解给以批判。（六）墙报、挑战是推动每个学习阶段的良好办法。（七）可以争论，使问题更明确。（八）联系实际，必须注意具体的和一般的结合。而具体的一般的又要避免太零碎或空洞、教条。（九）启发自由思想，对不正确的意见在总结中给以解释或批判。
    三、学习文件的方法：
    （一）精读文件与讨论相结合，阅读文件时（集体或个人）注意在每个段落里提出问题，然后大家讨论，讨论后再看文件或参考书。（二）分头酝酿，集中讨论。（三）上边提出的讨论题，支委组长首先抽出相当时间进行研究，统一领会文件的精神及所包括的范围，然后向全体同志解释，这样易于抓住中心，少走弯路。（四）随时随地漫谈测验。从文件的段落中，提出问题，使对方答复，答不上或答的不完善，再补充再解释，在游戏时间也可漫谈交换意见，其目的是为了相互帮助，彻底了解问题，但要注意，不要故意使人为难。（五）读文件的时间过长，内容过多，会使大家精神疲备，发生厌倦情绪，应适当进入讨论。（凯亚、陈伯鸿）
