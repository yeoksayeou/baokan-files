　　【North Yue News】Donghuishe Transportation Station in the Second District of Pingshan upholds the system, refuses illegal mobilization, and saves civilian labor. On the 11th of this month, a man and a woman were sent from the Jizhong station with luggage, requesting mobilization of livestock to be sent to Wentang. Both of them had mobilization certificates, but since they were neither sick nor wounded, it was clearly an illegal mobilization. Deputy Station Master Du immediately refused the mobilization and advised them to hire livestock to transport their belongings. They were very unhappy and questioned, "Why won't you mobilize since we have mobilization certificates?" Deputy Station Master Du then asked them to negotiate with the Armed Forces Department. The Armed Forces Department agreed with the station's approach, and they had to pay seven kilograms of rice as freight and hire a small donkey and a small cart. Before leaving, they revealed in conversation that the government originally gave them 4,000 yuan in transportation fees every day, but because it was not specified on the mobilization certificate, they took advantage of the situation, insisting that they had not received it and demanding compulsory mobilization. On the 12th, there were three cadres (two men and one woman) returning to Fanshi, carrying small iron pots, bowls, mats, and many pieces of luggage. They had a letter of introduction from the Organization Department of a certain unit in Jizhong, which read "Hope each station will send civilian labor to transfer them." The station refused to allocate labor based on the war service regulations. They had to hire five small donkeys. Because they were afraid of spending too much on road fees, they had to leave the mats behind. In addition to conscientiously implementing the new service regulations, the station also tried every means to save civilian labor. Station Master Li is very familiar with the carters nearby. When there are empty carts passing through Donghuishe, with the full consent of the carters, they transport glorious soldiers, the sick, and supplies who were prepared to mobilize civilian labor, saving manpower and animal power equivalent to more than 200 man-days in June and July alone.

　　东回舍交通站坚持制度
  　拒绝非法动用民力
    【北岳讯】平山二区东回舍交通站坚持制度，拒绝非法动员，节省了民力。本月十一日，从冀中沿站送出一男一女，随带行李，要求动员牲口送往温塘。该二人都有动员证，但既不是病员，又不是伤员明显系是法动员。杜副站长当即拒绝动员，劝他们雇牲口将东西运走。他们很不高兴地质问：“为什么有动员证不给动员？”杜副站长遂请他们去在武装部交涉。武装部同意站上的作法，他们只得出了七斤米的运费，雇了一个小驴，一个小车。临走时从谈话中才透露出公家原来每天给他们发四千元运费，因动员证上没有写明，他们就混水摸鱼，硬说没发，要求义务动员。十二日又有三个回繁峙的干部（两男一女），带有小铁锅、饭碗、席子及行李多件，拿着冀中某部组织部的介绍信，上写“望各站派民力转送”，要求动员，站上又根据战勤条例拒绝拨派，他们只好雇了五个小驴，因怕路费出得多，席子只好丢下。该站除认真执行新的勤条例外，并多方设法节省民力。李站长与附近赶大车的很熟识，遇有空车从东回舍过时，即经赶车的完全同意，将准备动员民力光荣的、病员、物品等运走，只六、七两个月内，即节省人畜力折人工二百多个。（四支社）
