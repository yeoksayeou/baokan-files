[Taiyue Telegram] Currently, two problems exist in Yangcheng's production: one is the laissez-faire attitude in leadership, and the other is the failure to correct certain deviations in mutual aid.

From July 25th to August 1st, the Yangcheng County Government invited more than 30 labor heroes and mutual aid team leaders to inspect and discuss production issues. First, it was discovered that several deviations had not yet been corrected. First, non-equivalent exchange: the wage policy of mutual aid teams adopted the low price policy that remained unchanged throughout the year, hindering the enthusiasm for production and creating many unreasonable phenomena. This spring, the mutual aid wage in Yangbai Village was 600 yuan per work day, equivalent to just over two *sheng* of corn, while outsiders who came to the village to help with the busy work were paid five *sheng* of corn per work day. Therefore, no team member was willing to work more. Zhang Qiyuan, the team leader of Dongjiao Village, sent his son out to do busy work during weeding, earning four *sheng* of rice per work day, and then hired other team members to work for him, paying a wage of two *sheng* of rice per day, which caused the mutual aid team to disband. Although it was reluctantly put back together, the wage issue remained unresolved. In mutual aid team work, emphasis was also placed on taking care of households in difficulty. Their work had to be done first, and those with labor and animal power felt that mutual aid was only a loss. Second, in some villages, the past mutual aid teams were confused with the village government. Some team leaders handled grain allocation and fund collection, and could not lead production well. Yang Tianfu, the team leader of Yu Meng, was originally a good worker, but because he was busy with these things, he ended up owing others seven *dou* of work rice in a year. Third, individual villages still emphasized collective production and collective use, ignoring the characteristics of the dispersed individual economy and private ownership basis in rural areas. Wu Julai's team in Shiyu Village extracted 20% of the money earned by team members, regardless of what they did, as public property, and those who did not produce also had to contribute some to accumulate a "public economy." Now, more than 700,000 yuan had been accumulated, and no dividends were distributed. Team members used public capital for transportation, and the money earned also went to the team. This summer, the "grain distribution mutual aid team" in Tangfeng Geliliang, a village under the jurisdiction of the fifth district's Machang administrative village, still practiced "disruptive equal distribution" of wheat. (This is a manifestation of agricultural socialist thought in production mutual aid. - Editor). After correcting the deviations, mandatory orders could no longer be imposed, but they did not know how to lead democratically. Many cadres said, "Now that there is democracy and freedom, there is no way to lead."

During the discussion, the issue of mutual aid teams engaging in the "collective economy" was the most debated. Old man Wu Julai said, "We extract income from team members to solve everyone's difficulties. With more money, team members don't need to make their own farm tools and furniture. The team can buy a set, and it's convenient for anyone to use it!" Labor hero Zhao Zucheng agreed and said, "The old man's intentions are good, and I don't think there's any problem." However, most people opposed it, believing that this was a practice divorced from reality. The Meng Village team leader said, "Our team bought a cow last year, but no one fed it, and in the end, it was sold because it couldn't be raised." Labor hero Hao Changgui also said, "If you do that, whoever works more and earns more will be extracted more from. Then who would be willing to work more?" Old man Wu Julai finally realized that his method was wrong. He said, "Before, I was thinking ahead with all my energy, but I didn't think about everyone wanting to disband the team. When I go back, I will quickly correct it and solve the problem based on the opinions of the team members. When working, each household should take turns, and we cannot always prioritize households in difficulty, otherwise, those with labor and animal power will feel that participating in the mutual aid team is only a loss, and mutual aid will be difficult to consolidate." Zhao Licheng said, "As long as mutual aid can truly benefit everyone, it cannot be disbanded even if you want it to be." When discussing wages, everyone unanimously agreed that wages cannot remain unchanged throughout the year. They should vary with the busy and slack seasons, be balanced with the surrounding villages, and be decided by the team members through public discussion. Cadres cannot stipulate wages for mutual aid teams. The team should help households without labor, enabling them to engage in whatever production they can. We cannot lower the wage prices just because we are taking care of those in difficulty. Mutual aid is to make everyone benefit and have interests. Then, the methods to be taken back were discussed. Everyone believed that first, they should actively work themselves. Hao Changgui said, "This year's production drifted not because the masses drifted, but because the cadres did not lead." Yang Fengchun said, "Since last winter, I have been carrying a burden, wondering if the government still wanted labor heroes or not? I felt a little discouraged because I was a middle peasant. After reading the message to party members, I felt that there was no problem! I felt relieved. When I go back, I will still lead production well." On how to implement democratic leadership, Zhao Licheng said, "Everyone should not complain that there is too much democracy and freedom. The Communist Party is calling for democracy and freedom for the people. The problem is that we must first lay the foundation correctly, discuss things with everyone, and correct them if they are wrong. Everyone should establish a system and abide by it together, and then require team members to obey the leadership." Su Qicheng further said, "To be a team leader, you must first not be subjective, second not be biased, and third, when team members make mistakes, you must patiently persuade them, and not just criticize them." The meeting discussed and decided on the methods to rectify mutual aid: (1) Good teams should continue to implement the principles of voluntary and equivalent exchange. Lead everyone to work hard. (2) Teams with problems should solve them immediately, especially the issue of wage arrears, which should be thoroughly cleared. (3) Those with too many problems in the past, and whose masses are dissatisfied and demand dissolution, can be declared dissolved, re-organized voluntarily, and start from scratch. At the end of the meeting, labor hero Hao Changgui said, "This meeting has pulled us back from the wrong path and called on everyone to go on the right path. When we go back, we must work hard."

　　阳城检查互助中的偏向
  　违反等价原则强搞“集体经济”
    误解民主自由生产放任自流
    【太岳电】阳城生产中目前存在两个问题，一个是领导上的放任自流，另一个是互助中的某些偏向尚未纠正。
    阳城县政府七月二十五日到八月一日，邀集劳动英雄互助组长卅余人，检查与讨论生产问题。首先发现了几个偏向还未纠正。第一、非等价交换，互助组工资采取当年不变的低价政策，妨碍了生产积极性，产生了很多不合理现象。阳柏村今春互助工资是每工六百元，约合玉茭二升多，而外村人来本村打忙工，却是每工五升玉茭。因此组员谁也不愿多做工。东交村组长张启元在锄苗时，打发他儿子出去打忙工，每工赚四升米，又让别的组员给他做活，按每天二升米开工资，弄得互助组散了伙。后虽勉强捏在一起，但工资问题仍没解决。在互助组做活上也强调照顾困难户，他们的活要做在前头，有劳力有畜力的人感到互助净吃亏。第二、有些村过去的互助组和村政权混淆不清，有些组长派粮派款啥也干，不能很好领导生产。于孟组长杨添福本来是个好劳动，因忙于这些事情，一年下来反给别人出了七斗工米。第三、个别村还在强调集体生产，集体使用，忽视农村分散的个体经济私有基础之特点。石臾村吴巨来组不管做啥，组员赚下钱组里要抽二成，作为公共财产，不生产的也要拿出一些来，积垒“公共经济”，现在已积下七十多万元，也不给分红，组员用公共资本去运输，赚下钱也归组里。五区町店行政村唐峰圪梁的“分粮互助组”，今夏麦子仍是“打乱均分”（这是农业社会主义思想在生产互助中的表现。——编者）。纠偏以后，不能再强迫命令，但又不会民主领导，好些干部都说：“现在民主自由了，没法领导。”
    讨论中对互助组搞“集体经济”问题争执最大，吴巨来老汉说：“我们抽组员收入，是为了解决大家的困难，钱多了，农具家具都不用各人制，组里买下一套，谁用也方便呀！”劳动英雄赵组成就赞成说：“老汉的用意是好的，我认为没啥问题”。但多数人反对，认为这是脱离实际的作法，孟村组长说：“我组里去年伙买下个牛，有人使没人喂，结果弄不成才把它卖了。”劳动英雄郝昌贵也说：“那么办谁劳动赚的多，就抽的谁多，那谁还愿多劳动？”吴巨来老汉最后才认识了自己的办法不对，他说：“以前我是一股劲往前想，就没想到大家要散组，回去要根据组员意见很快改正，解决。在做活时要各家轮流开，不能完全先尽困难户，不然有劳动有畜力的人就感到参加互助组只有吃亏的份儿，互助就难巩固。”赵礼成说：“只要互助真能做到对大家有利，叫他散也散不了。”讨论到工资时，大家一致意见：工资不能常年不变，要随季节忙闲，和周围村取得平衡，由组员公议决定，干部不能给互助组规定工资。对无劳力户，组里应帮助他们，能做啥做啥，进行生产，不能因为照顾困难就压低工价。互助就是要使大家都有好处，有利益。接着讨论到回去作的办法，大家认为：首先自己应积极起来干，郝昌贵说：“今年生产自流，不是群众自流，是干部不领导自流了。”杨逢春说：“自去冬以来，我就背着个包袱，怀疑政府还要劳动英雄不要？觉得自己是个中农，有些灰心，后来看了告党员书，觉得也没啥问题呀！才放了心，回去还要好好领导生产”。在怎样实行民主领导的问题上，赵礼成说：“大家不应怨民主自由太多了，共产党就是叫人民民主自由哩，问题是咱先把底子打正，遇事和大家商量，有不对就改正，大家订出制度，共同遵守，然后再要求组员服从领导。”苏启成更进一步说：“当组长要第一不主观，第二不偏三向四，第三组员有错误时要耐心说服，不能光是批评。会上讨论决定了整顿互助的办法：（一）好的组应继续贯彻自愿等价的原则。领导大家好好的干起来。（二）有问题的组应即刻解决问题，特别是工资拖欠问题，要普遍作一清算。（三）过去毛病太多，群众不满要求解散的，可以宣布解散，重新自愿结合，从头做起。散会时劳动英雄郝昌贵说：“今回开会就是把咱从错路上拉回，叫大家都向正路上走，回去一定要好好干。”
