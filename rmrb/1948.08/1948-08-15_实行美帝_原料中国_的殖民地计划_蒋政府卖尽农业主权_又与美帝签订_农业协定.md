Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th—Following the notorious traitorous "Bilateral Agreement" of July 3rd, the Kuomintang government has signed another agreement with U.S. imperialism, forming a so-called "Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction in China" in partnership with the United States, comprehensively selling out China's agricultural sovereignty to the United States. This agreement was announced in Nanjing on the 5th of this month in the form of an "exchange of letters." The agreement stipulates that the "Joint Commission" will be composed of two Americans appointed by the U.S. President, together with three members of the Kuomintang government, and the U.S. government may arbitrarily send Americans to China to serve as "staff" of the commission. This "Commission," which is virtually entirely controlled by the United States, will become the highest supervisory and command organ for agriculture in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The agreement stipulates the following privileges for the Commission: First, to "formulate" and "supervise" the implementation of various agricultural plans, encompassing everything from agricultural production, sales, credit, irrigation, animal husbandry, family and rural industries to rural education. From then on, U.S. imperialism can penetrate every aspect of the rural areas in the Kuomintang-controlled areas without any gap. Second, the Commission has the power to appoint "executive officials and administrative personnel deemed necessary" for the implementation of the plan. Third, the Commission has the right to establish "cooperation" methods with "appropriate Chinese (Kuomintang) government agencies and international or private institutions in China," and implement the Commission's plan through these institutions. The Commission can "maintain constant supervision" over these institutions, and the "qualifications, types, and number of personnel used by each institution" are also "determined" by the Commission. At the same time, the U.S. government can also use this "Commission" to provide American monopoly capitalists who are appearing in China with various "international or private institutions" to facilitate the aggression against China's agriculture. Fourth, ten percent of the 275 million U.S. dollars of so-called "economic assistance" given by the United States to the Kuomintang will be specifically used as the U.S. imperialism's aggressive funds for Chinese agriculture, which will be managed and used by the Commission. In addition, the Commission has the right to "recommend" to the Kuomintang government at any time to allocate "other funds and assistance." Fifth, the American members and American staff of the Commission must be "regarded as part of the U.S. Embassy in China" and enjoy extraterritorial rights, tax exemption rights, and other privileges.

　　In his statement in Nanjing on the 5th regarding the exchange of letters agreement, John Leighton Stuart openly stated that "most of the materials and recommendations gathered by the Sino-American Agricultural Joint Delegation in 1946 will be used as the basis for the work of the Commission." The so-called "Sino-American Agricultural Joint Delegation" was the "Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team" dispatched by the U.S. government to China in June 1946 to conduct an inspection. The team spent five months in China, touring fifteen provinces, and finally produced the "Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Plan" (also known as the "China Agricultural Construction Plan"), which is actually a thorough colonial plan of "Raw Materials China." Its content is to control China's agricultural production with American personnel and American technology, extract "export products" such as tung oil, wool, tea, and silk needed by the United States, and strictly control China's rural areas by establishing "Agricultural Bank," "Agricultural Administration Bureau," "Agricultural Extension Bureau," and "Agricultural Guidance Research and Extension Center." The U.S. imperialists are now establishing the "Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction in China" in an attempt to accelerate and implement on a larger scale this vicious plan to enslave the Chinese people that the United States has long planned.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th—According to Central News Agency reports on July 16th and 23rd, the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, which serves as the direct supervisory body for U.S. aid to the Kuomintang government, has recently decided to establish a so-called "Agricultural Demonstration Zone" covering twenty-five counties in Zhejiang in accordance with the original recommendations of the "Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team," as one of the promotion centers for the U.S. plan to invade China's agriculture. To this end, the Administration has signed an agreement with the Kuomintang Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and has established a "Preparatory Committee for Agricultural Demonstration" to preside over the matter. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's advisory group in China is also directly involved in presiding over this aggressive plan. The advisory group can designate one person as an "ex officio member" of the Preparatory Committee.

　　实行美帝“原料中国”的殖民地计划
  　蒋政府卖尽农业主权
    又与美帝签订“农业协定”
    【新华社陕北十二日电】继七月三日的著名卖国协定“双边协定”以后，国民党政府又与美帝国主义签订另一协定，和美国合组一个所谓“中国农村复兴联合委员会”，全面出卖中国农业主权给美国，该协定已于本月五日在南京以“换文”方式发表。协定规定该“联合委员会”将由美国总统委派美国人二名会同国民党政府人员三人组成之，美政府并可任意派遣美人来华担任该会“职员”。这个实际上完全归美国控制的“委员会”将成为国民党统治区农业的最高监督和指挥机关。协定规定该会特权如下：第一，“拟定”和“督察”实行各项农业计划，从农业生产、销售、信用、灌溉、畜牧、家庭与乡村工业以至农村教育等，无所不包，美帝国主义从此即可无孔不入地侵进国民党统治区农村的各个方面。第二，该会有任命为执行计划“所认为必要之执行官吏与行政人员”的大权。第三，该会有权与“适当的中国（国民党）政府机构及在中国之国际或私人机构”订立“合作”办法，经由这些机构实施该会计划，该会对各机构可“保持经常督察”，“各机构所用人员之资格、种类及数目”亦由该会“订定”；同时，美国政府又可通过这个“委员会”，给正以各式各样的“国际或私人机构”在中国出现的美国垄断资本家以侵略中国农业的便利。第四，美国给国民党的二亿七千五百万美元的所谓“经济援助”中，将拨出百分之十，专作美帝国主义对中国农业之侵略经费，交由该会管理使用，除此以外，该会还有权随时“建议”国民党政府拨与“其他资金及援助”。第五，该会美国委员及美国职员，须“视为美国驻中国大使馆之一部分”，享受治外法权、免税权等特权。
    司徒雷登五日在南京关于该换文协定之声明中，公开说明“一九四六年中美农业联合代表团所招集之材料和建议，大部分将被用作该委员会工作之基础。”所谓“中美农业联合代表团”，即一九四六年六月美政府派遣来华考察之“中美农业技术合作团”，该团在华历时五个月，遍历中国十五省，最后制成“中美农业合作计划”（亦称“中国农业建设计划”），该计划实际上是一个彻头彻尾的“原料中国”的殖民地计划。其内容系以美国人员和美国技术控制中国农业生产，榨取美国所需要的桐油、羊毛、茶、丝等“外销产品”，并通过建立“农业银行”、“农业管理局”、“农业推广局”、“农业指导研究及推广中心”等办法，严格控制中国农村。美帝国主义者现在成立“中国农村复兴联合委员会”，乃妄图加速和更大规模地实行美国所久已拟定的这个奴役中国人民的恶毒计划。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据七月十六日及二十三日中央社消息透露：作为美国援助国民党政府的直接监督机关的美国经济合作总署驻华分署，近已按照“中美农业技术合作团”的原建议，决定在浙江设立一包括二十五县的所谓“农业示范区”，作为美国对中国农业侵略计划的推行中心之一。该署为此已与国民党农林部签订协议，并已成立“农业示范筹备委员会”，主持此事之进行。联合国粮农组织驻华顾问团亦直接参与主持此项侵略计划，该顾问团可指定一人为筹委会“当然委员”。
