What I Saw in Jinzhong

　　The Jinzhong Plain, rich in resources and products, has become a living hell under Yan Xishan's tyrannical rule of "combining soldiers and farmers," "self-confession and rebirth," and "purging disguised elements," along with grain grabbing and forced conscription. Human life is cheap, fields are barren, and the misery is unbearable to witness. In Houcun Town, Yuci, on the twelfth day of the first lunar month this year, 56 farmers, including Dong Wenyi, Dong Sanhai, and Ji Tuze, were beaten to death with clubs. In Chenhu Township, over 220 people were beaten to death in five villages. The reason for the killings was that they were "disguised elements" who "failed to undergo self-confession and rebirth." Yan Xishan's slogan was "Those who do not confess thoroughly will be beaten to death with clubs." Zhang Dingzhong and four others from Baicheng Village in Taigu, and Duan Yusen and seventeen others from Chefu Village in Yuci, were all killed in this way. The common people say, "We don't know if we'll die at night, we don't know if we'll die in the afternoon, we don't know if we'll die at any moment." Human life is cheap and uncertain. Yan Xishan, under the pretext of "combining soldiers and farmers," is also conscripting soldiers on a large scale, forcing people between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to join the army through compulsory organization, land distribution, and forcing the people to provide grain as a bribe. Dozens of people are conscripted from each village. Baicheng Village was forced to form 31 groups and 62 people were conscripted. More than 80 people were conscripted from Dongfu Village. Villages along the railway were also forced to have women build碉堡 (碉堡 is a type of blockhouse). Women in Baicheng Village worked for more than 20 days in a month this spring, and the elderly took turns on night哨 (哨 is guard duty), resulting in the large-scale abandonment of land. Dongfu Village originally had more than 9,000 mu of land, of which more than 2,000 mu were abandoned when the Japanese occupied it, and now it has increased to more than 4,000 mu. After the implementation of "combining soldiers and farmers," most of the old and young people lost their land. Lu Shenglian, an old man from Baicheng Village in Taigu, had a family of five, with 25 mu of land, all of which was confiscated by Yan Xishan. The national soldiers who were allocated a share of the land also have no guarantee of life. The grain they harvested was extorted by Yan Xishan through various means. The Yan Liangzhuang family in Pingyao was allocated 40 mu of land, and this year they only planted more than 20 mu of wheat, harvesting more than 12 shi. Yan Xishan charged three shi and five dou and two sheng of grain for one liang of silver grain, so they had to pay more than ten shi of silver grain, plus three shi for preferential treatment of standing soldiers, subsidies for township, district, and county offices, grain for material purchase, monthly borrowed grain, additional wheat, horse feed, etc., which amounted to more than 20 shi. As a result, the entire amount was handed over and it was still not enough. In Dongcun and other villages in Taigu, because they did not hand over enough public grain, the masses sold their houses and furniture, and 72 people have starved to death. More than 100 people are sick from hunger. They are too weak to move, lying in bed and crying every day, a scene too miserable to witness. They all ask our army to take Taiyuan as soon as possible.

　　晋中见闻
    物阜民丰的晋中平原，在阎匪“兵农合一”“自白转生”“肃清伪装”抢粮抓丁等苛政下，已变成人间地狱，人命微贱，田园荒芜，凄惨之状，目不忍睹。榆次侯村镇今年正月十二日用乱棍打死农民董文义、董三海、吉秃则等五十六个人。陈胡乡五个村打死二百二十余人。打死的理由是“伪装分子”，“自白转生不了。”阎匪的口号是“自白不彻底的，乱棍打死你”。太谷白城张丁钟等五人、榆次车辅村段玉森等十七人，都被这样杀害。老百姓说：“俺们白天不知夜间死，早上不知下午死，这会不知那会死，”人命微贱朝不保夕。阎匪更借口“兵农合一”大肆抓丁，把十八岁以上、四十五岁以下的人都用强编组、强分地册、强叫老百姓出粮收买等毒辣办法强迫当兵。每村被抓的都在数十个。白城村强编三十一组，抓走六十二人。东辅村抓走八十多人。沿铁路一带村庄并强迫妇女修筑碉堡，白城村妇女们今春一个月就做工二十多天，老年人夜间还轮流放哨，以至土地大部荒芜。东辅村原有地九千多亩，日寇占领时荒了二千余亩，现已增至四千余亩。实行“兵农合一”后，大部老幼失掉土地。太谷白城村吕生谅老汉全家老小五口人，二十五亩地，全被阎匪没收。分得一份土地的国民兵，生活也无保障。他们打下的粮食，阎匪用各种办法勒索净尽。平遥阎良庄一家分到四十亩的一份地，今年只种了二十多亩麦子，打了十二石多，阎匪一两银粮就要三石五斗二，共银粮就得出十石多，加上优待常备兵粮三石、乡区县办公补助费、物资代购粮、月份借粮、附加麦、马料等，就得出二十多石，结果全数交出还不够。太谷董村等村因交公粮不够，群众变卖了房产、家具，并已饿死七十二人，因饥饿成疾者一百多人，他们饿得不能动弹，天天躺在床上啼哭，惨不忍闻。他们都要求我军赶快把太原打下来。
