　　Preventing Encephalitis
    Wang Gang
    Recently, encephalitis has been prevalent near Pingshan, with six cases already discovered and two deaths. This disease is difficult to treat, and if it becomes widespread, it poses a great danger. It is hoped that early attention will be paid to prevention to avoid transmission. A brief description of encephalitis symptoms and prevention methods is provided below for reference.
    Symptoms: Encephalitis is divided into four types: epidemic, St. Louis, post-infectious disease, and common. The cases currently discovered are either epidemic or St. Louis type. The cause of the epidemic is generally believed to be a filterable virus that invades through the nasopharyngeal cavity. The mode of transmission is not yet known, but according to existing reports, it is transmitted from person to person and by insects. It can infect people of all ages, but is more common in those between ten and forty-five years old. The St. Louis type mostly affects people over forty-five years old. The most prevalent seasons are spring and winter, while the St. Louis type is more prevalent in summer. The incubation period is four to fifteen days. The onset of symptoms varies greatly. It can be sudden or gradual. The initial stage often involves respiratory infection symptoms such as headache, weakness, and fever, similar to a cold. There may also be sudden fainting, loss of sensation, paralysis, severe headache, delirium, followed by lethargy, stupor, blindness, or hypersensitive irritation symptoms. The symptoms vary depending on the location of the lesion in the brain. There may or may not be prodromal symptoms, with sudden high fever up to 41 degrees Celsius, nausea, vomiting, headache, difficulty speaking or aphasia, convulsions, and even death. White blood cell count increases or becomes abnormal. Cerebrospinal fluid is transparent, and some cases turn chronic. Patients themselves report symptoms such as headache, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, restlessness, movement disorders, and tremors, lasting for months or years before recovering. The mortality rate is 20% to 30%.
    Prevention methods: Isolate patients, disinfect excrement, attendants and family members should wear masks and wash hands frequently, and refuse visitors to see patients.
    Treatment methods: There is no specific drug or treatment for this disease, only symptomatic treatment. Sulfa drugs and penicillin are ineffective. Patients should rest in bed, be isolated, and avoid light, sound, and vibration. Eat liquid foods, sponge bathe with cold water, drink plenty of water, inject glucose, and perform lumbar puncture to release 5CC of fluid. For convulsions, atropine or Luminal can be injected. For dehydration, physiological saline can be injected.

　　预防脑炎
    王钢
    最近平山附近流行脑炎，已发现病人六人，死亡二人。此病治疗困难，如流行起来，危险很大，希望早加注意预防，以免传播。兹简述脑炎病状及预防法以供参考。
    症状：脑炎分为流行性型、圣路易型、传染病后型、普通型四种。现在发现者为流行性型或为圣路易型。流行原因一般相信为一种滤过性病毒，由鼻咽喉腔侵入，传染方式尚不能确知，但据已有报告，系由人与人互相传染及昆虫传播，不分年龄均可传染，以十岁至四十五岁者为多，圣路易型多侵四十五岁以上者。其流行季节，春冬两季为最多，圣路易型多流行于夏季。潜伏期四至十五日，病状初起颇有不同，有忽然发病，或渐渐发生，初期多为呼吸器传染，头痛、无力、发热，类似感冒。亦有忽然发生昏厥、感觉消失、瘫痪、严厉的头痛、谵语，以后陷于嗜眠昏睡、眼失明，或运动过敏的刺激症状。因病灶所在的脑中位置不同，所发生症状亦异，有或无前驱症，突然高热到四十一度，恶心呕吐、头痛、言语困难或失语、抽风、以至死亡，白血球增多或失常，脑脊髓液透明，有的转入慢性。病人自己诉说症状是头痛、头昏、失眠、疲倦不安，运动障碍、震颤、延长数月或数年而恢复。死亡率百分之二十至三十。
    预防法：隔离病人，排泄物消毒，侍候病人者及家属，带口罩、勤洗手，拒绝探视病人。
    治疗法：本病无特效药及治疗法，只是对症疗法，磺胺及潘尼西林无效。病人卧床休息，隔离、避免光线、声音、和振动。吃流动食物，冷水擦身，多饮水，注射葡萄糖，及腰椎穿刺放出液体五ＣＣ。抽风时，可注射阿透品或鲁朱那尔，脱水时可注射生理食盐水。
