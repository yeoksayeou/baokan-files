    Jointly Build the Liberated Area's Industry
    Telegram of Congratulations from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Trade Union Council and the Jin-Cha-Ji General Labor Union to the Labor Congress
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Trade Union Council and the Jin-Cha-Ji General Labor Union recently jointly sent a telegram to congratulate the Sixth National Labor Congress being held in Harbin. The original telegram is as follows: To the Presidium of the Sixth National Labor Congress and all the delegate comrades:
    At this moment when the People's Liberation War is victoriously entering its third year, and the revolution is approaching nationwide victory, upon learning the news that the Sixth National Labor Congress has opened in your city of Harbin, the workers and brothers of our two regions extend joyous and encouraging victory confidence to celebrate the success of the Congress and celebrate the unification of the national workers' organizations.
    Under the leadership of its own political party, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class, for the liberation of its own class and the people of the whole country, since the "February 7th" Movement, in the successive revolutionary struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and overthrowing the reactionary group's rule, has demonstrated the heroic and indomitable revolutionary vanguard role and created a glorious historical page. Our North China Liberated Area workers have made due contributions in military industry and other industrial production during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the two years of the People's Revolutionary War. Now that the unified North China Liberated Area has just been established, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji trade unions are planning the unification of the two regions' worker organizations and the unification of actions, so as to give greater play to our heroism on the production front and strive for the restoration and improvement of the industrial construction of the North China Liberated Area. We vow to greet the combat tasks assigned to us by the Congress with more strenuous efforts. In the unified national workers' movement, we will fulfill our responsibilities. We deeply believe that under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Congress and the unified leading organ of the national workers' movement elected by the Congress will surely further unite and strengthen the combat power of the national working class, guide us and the people of the whole country to overthrow the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek, and finally realize an independent, free, prosperous, and strong New Democratic New China.

    合力建设解放区工业
    晋冀鲁豫职工会、晋察冀总工会电贺劳动大会
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫职工会与晋察冀总工会，顷联名电贺正在哈尔滨举行之第六次全国劳动大会，原电如下：第六次全国劳动大会主席团转全体代表同志们：
    当此人民解放战争胜利地进入第三年，革命已接近全国胜利的时候，获悉第六次全国劳动大会在自己的城市哈尔滨开幕的消息，我两区职工兄弟谨以欢腾鼓舞的胜利信心来庆祝大会的成功，庆祝全国职工组织的统一。
    中国工人阶级在自己的政党，中国共产党领导下，为了自己阶级与全国人民的解放，从“二七”运动以来，在反帝反封建推翻反动集团统治的历次革命斗争中，都表现了英雄顽强的革命先锋作用，创造了光辉的史页。我们华北解放区工人在八年抗战与二年人民革命战争中，在军工及其他各种工业生产上，曾作了应有的供献。现在统一的华北解放区刚告成立我们晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两区工会正在筹划两区职工组织的统一与行动的统一，以便更高度的发挥我们在生产战线上的英雄主义，为恢复与提高华北解放区的工业建设而奋斗。我们誓以更加奋勉的努力来迎接大会所交付我们的战斗任务。在全国统一的职工运动中，克尽我们的职责。我们深信，在中共中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，大会和大会选举出来的全国职工运动的统一领导机关，必将更加团结与增强全国工人阶级的战斗力量，引导我们和全国人民一起推翻美帝及其走狗国民党蒋介石的反动统治，最后实现独立自由富强的新民主主义的新中国。
