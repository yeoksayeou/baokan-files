Xinhua News Agency, Central Shanxi Front, 10th. The First Army Group of the North China People's Liberation Army entered Central Shanxi for combat this time. Its strict discipline has won the enthusiastic love and support of the people of Central Shanxi. After a certain unit captured Kaishan Line north of Wenshui at midnight, they bivouacked on the streets without disturbing a single shop or civilian residence. Only after the shops and houses opened in the morning did they borrow rooms to stay in. Each squad and platoon immediately cleaned the courtyards for the landlords and comforted the villagers, saying, "You've been frightened." When the troops moved, the discipline inspection team checked each household. The masses generally reflected, "Nothing was damaged. Look how clean the courtyards are swept, and the water vats are full. You can't find such a good army like yours anywhere in the world." When a certain unit entered Wenshui, they did not enter any shops or civilian houses. When a merchant in the South Street asked the People's Liberation Army to borrow furniture and issued an IOU, he said, "The last time the comrades recovered this place, nothing was missing. I know the discipline of our army is strict, so there's no need for an IOU." When a certain unit advanced to the west bank of the Fen River in Pingyao, it sent a squad to guard the ferry crossing. There were still many Yan's bandits in the fortifications on the opposite bank. The squad fired five shots, and the Yan's bandits fled in panic. At this time, a group of women who had been abducted by the Yan's bandits in a distant village on the opposite bank took the opportunity to escape, running to the riverbank with disheveled hair and crying to the People's Liberation Army, "Save us!" At that time, the Yan's bandits had chased out of the village, and there was only one boat on the opposite bank that had not yet reached the shore, and the situation was critical. The squad fired machine guns at the enemy while Deputy Political Instructor Yang Yushu led several soldiers into the water, swam to the opposite bank, untied the ferry boat, and rescued more than 30 of them. Soon, more than 20 women escaped, and the soldiers of the squad, disregarding the danger, also pushed the boat to ferry them over. The nearby villagers all said, "We will never forget the kindness of the People's Liberation Army." The people in the newly liberated areas all voluntarily rose up to support the army and care for the wounded. When a certain unit marched through Beiqi Village in Wenshui, the troops cooked rice porridge and rested. When they woke up, they found noodles in the rice porridge. They asked the landlady, and it turned out that she was afraid that the troops would be hungry, so she cooked them. She said that all the grain had been looted by the Yan's bandits, otherwise she would have treated the troops to a meal of oil cakes. After each battle, the local people enthusiastically raised eggs, pork, and other items to慰勞 [comfort] the troops. Villages passed through by stretcher teams all set up reception stations and drinking stations. Women and children went in groups to慰問 [express sympathy and solicitude to] wounded soldiers passing by, handing water and feeding them eggs, with great diligence. In the areas where the People's Liberation Army field hospitals were located, nearby women and children voluntarily signed up to participate in nursing work. In six villages in Xiaoyi, 98 women cooked and washed clothes for the wounded and took turns caring for them. In the third district of Jiaocheng, more than 30 women and more than 60 children voluntarily signed up to participate in the temporary hospital work in seven days.

　　华北解放军第一兵团
    深得晋中人民热爱
  　新区群众自动劳军看护伤员
    【新华社晋中前线十日电】此次华北解放军第一兵团进入晋中作战，纪律严明，深得晋中人民的热忱爱戴。某部于半夜攻克文水以北之开栅线后，即露宿街头，未惊动一家铺户民宅。直待天明各家开门后才借房驻扎。各班排立即给房东打扫街院，并安慰老乡说：“你们受惊了。”部队转移时，纪律检查组按户检查，群众普遍反映：“没损什么，你看房院打扫得光光的，水缸满满的，普天下打着灯笼，也找不到象你们这样好的军队哩。”某部攻入文水，商店民房一概未进。南街一家商民当解放军向其借家具开借条时，他说：“前次同志们收复这里，借用东西一件没少。我知道咱们队伍的纪律是严格的，不用开借条了。”某部进至平遥汾河西岸，派一个班至渡口警戒，对岸工事里尚有不少阎匪。该班连发五枪阎匪即狼狈逃窜。此时对岸远处村中有被阎匪掳去的一群妇女乘机逃出，披头散发跑至河岸向解放军哭叫：“快救我们！”当时阎匪已从村中追出，对岸河中仅有一只未靠到岸的船，情势危急。该班一面用机枪向敌人扫射，一面由副政治指导员杨余树率领战士数人跃入水中，泅至对岸解开渡船把她们三十多人救过来。不久又有妇女二十余人逃来，该班战士不顾危险，亦撑船把她们渡过来。附近村民都说：“永远忘不了解放军的恩情。”新区人民均自动起来劳军，看护伤员。某部行军过文水北齐村，部队熬下米汤休息了，醒来一看米汤里却有面条，问房东太太，原来是她怕部队受饿煮上的。她说粮食都被阎匪抢了，不然她就要请部队吃顿油糕。我军每次战斗后，当地人民均热烈募集鸡蛋、猪肉等物慰劳。担架队经过的村庄，人民均设有招待站、喝水站等，妇女儿童结伙慰问过路伤员，递水喂鸡蛋，十分殷勤。解放军野战医院所在地，附近妇女儿童都自动报名参加看护工作，孝义六个村庄就有九十八个妇女为伤员做饭洗衣，轮流看护。交城三区七天中就有三十多个妇女和六十多个儿童自动报名参加临时医院工作。
