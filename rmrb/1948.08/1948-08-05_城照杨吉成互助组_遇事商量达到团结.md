    Cheng Zhao Yang Jicheng Mutual Aid Group
    Consulting on Matters to Achieve Unity
    [Taihang News] The Yang Jicheng mutual aid group in Cheng Zhao Village, Gaoyi, has been developing steadily since its establishment last spring. Everyone is very united, and production has been successful. The reason is that everyone can discuss matters and decide on the best course of action. For example, when watering seedlings last year, the allocation of labor and waterwheels was unfair, and some people suffered losses. After everyone discussed it, a fair distribution was determined, and everyone was satisfied. Last autumn, the government called for the organization of small-scale cooperatives. They merged with Yang Jinyu's group, forming a small-scale cooperative of fourteen households, with twelve full laborers and eight women, raising 90,000 yuan in shares. Yang Jinyu was elected as the cooperative director, and Yang Jicheng became the team leader. In one month, they made a profit of 150,000 yuan. During the autumn harvest, after everyone discussed it, some people engaged in cotton ginning, transportation, and other side occupations, while the women participated in the autumn harvest, ensuring that neither was delayed. They earned two liters of sorghum for each day of work, and they worked very energetically. By the end of the year, everyone's initial investment of 10,000 yuan had turned into 70,000 yuan. In order to produce more and earn more money, no one withdrew their shares last year. This spring, some members who were in difficulty wanted to withdraw their shares, but after everyone discussed it, the cooperative bought four shi of sorghum and lent it to nine poor members, resolving their difficulties. They then did not withdraw their shares. During the wheat harvest, everyone participated in harvesting wheat, harvesting ninety-three mu in one day. After the rain, twelve people and six head of livestock planted one hundred and thirteen mu of land in three days. According to the agricultural and sideline product settlement, from February to May of this year, the net profit was 1,048,000 yuan. At the same time, the land was also planted very well.

    城照杨吉成互助组
    遇事商量达到团结
    【太行讯】高邑城照村杨吉成互助组，从去春成立到现在，一直在向上发展。大家都很团结，生产也搞的有成绩。原因是遇事能大家商量，怎好怎办。如去年浇小苗时，劳力、水车分配不公，有的吃了亏，经大家商量，定出分来，就都满意了。去秋政府号召组织小型社，他们和杨金玉组合并起来，全组共十四户，整劳动力十二个，妇女八个，集股九万元组成小型社，杨金玉被选为社长，杨吉成当了组长。一个月获利十五万元。收秋时经大家商量，由一部分人搞轧花、运输等副业，妇女们参加秋收，作到两不耽误，她们每人干一天赚高粱二升，干的很有劲。到年底，每人一万的本都变成了七万元。为了多生产多赚钱，去年都没有抽股。今春社员中有些没办法的要想抽股，经大家商议，由社内买了四石高粱，借给九家贫苦社员，解决了困难。他们便不抽股了。麦收时全体参加收麦，一天就收了九十三亩。落雨后十二个人、六头牲口，三天中就种了一百十三亩地。据农副业结算，从今年二月到五月，净获利一百零四万八千元。同时地也种的很好。
