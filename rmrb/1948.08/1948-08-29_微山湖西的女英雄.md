The Chiang bandits had long carried out "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations in the area west of Weishan Lake in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Some female comrades in the western Weishan Lake area, as courageous and tenacious as their male counterparts, fought against the Chiang bandits. In emergency situations, they traveled 130 li in one night, crossing rivers and wading through water. Some even carried guns and led militia, lying in ambush by the roadside when the enemy passed through, capturing enemy stragglers and those who had fallen behind. Relying on tunnels and underground caves, they and the masses consistently maintained their posts. When war service tasks arrived, every female comrade, regardless of day or night, rain or shine, would take a hand grenade alone and go to the villages to gather stretcher-bearers, militiamen, and carry out sentry duty and other combat tasks. In the western Weishan Lake area, this had become very commonplace among the female comrades. Now, let's just give one or two examples: Li Xiu and Zhang Xiuzhi, two female comrades from Shanxian County, were both group leaders of work teams. In the intervals between battles, they led the masses in production, and when the enemy came, they led the militia to fight guerrilla warfare. Last October, when our army raided the Longhai Railway, the two of them personally led the laborers to sabotage the railway. Comrade Zhang Xiuzhi served as the battalion commander of the labor force camp, and Comrade Li Xiu served as the instructor. They broke the railway with the laborers at night, and during the day when the laborers rested, they also led the laborers to transport supplies, without a good night's sleep for eight days and eight nights, victoriously completing the road-breaking task. After returning, the enemy situation became tense, and Comrade Zhang Xiuzhi immediately led the masses to resettle the wounded soldiers. Once, a unit of the enemy's Provisional 70th Division was stationed in Huanggangji. Comrade Li Xiu took six militiamen to scout. Seeing the enemy, she led the militiamen to squat in the sorghum fields, cleverly avoiding the enemy. When the enemy returned, they divided into two routes to attack her stationed village. She heard the enemy firing guns at the entrance of the village and then led the militiamen to evacuate. Once, they squatted in an underground cave. The enemy walked over their cave, and discovering a cave, they fired guns. She used soil to block the entrance of the cave. After the enemy passed, an old man called her, but she mistakenly thought it was the enemy and did not answer. The masses in the village thought she had been captured by the enemy and searched everywhere. They established an inseparable and close relationship with the people. These female comrades, in the two years of the People's Liberation War, have undergone severe tests, and their revolutionary will to serve the people and liberate women has become even more determined. Their glorious deeds of struggle are indelible in the chronicles of the great guerrilla war.

　　微山湖西的女英雄
    蒋匪曾长期“清剿”“扫荡”我冀鲁豫微山湖以西地区。湖西地区有一些女同志们，与男同志一样英勇顽强的和蒋匪进行斗争，在紧急情况下，一夜走一百三十里，渡河涉水；还有的扛着枪，领导着民兵，在敌人过境时，伏在路旁，捉敌散兵和掉队人员。她们依靠地道、地洞，和群众一起始终坚持自己的岗位。当战勤任务到来时，每个女同志不论白天与黑夜，不避风雨，一个人拿着手榴弹，到各村集合担架民工站岗放哨等等战斗任务，在湖西地区女同志中间，已经是很平常的事情了。现只举一两个例子：单虞县李秀、张秀芝两女同志，都是工作组的小组长，她们在战争空隙里，领导群众生产，敌人来了就领着民兵打游击。去年十月，我军破袭陇海路时，她俩个亲自带领民工去破坏铁路。张秀芝同志任民工营营长，李秀同志任指导员，她们晚上和民工一起破铁路，白天民工们休息时，她俩还领着民工运送给养，八天八夜没很好的睡一觉，胜利的完成了破路任务。回来后敌情紧张了，张秀芝同志又马上领导群众安置伤员。有一次，敌暂编七十师一部驻黄岗集，李秀同志带六个民兵去侦察，看见敌人，她就领着民兵蹲在高粱地里，机警的避过了敌人，敌人回来时，分两路向她的驻村合击，她听见敌人在村头上打枪，才领着民兵转移出来。有一次，她们蹲在地洞里，敌人从她们这个洞上走过，发觉有一个洞就打枪，她用土把洞口堵死；敌人过去了，一个老大爷喊她，她误认为是敌人，没有答应，村里群众以为被敌人捉去了，便四出寻找。她们和人民建立了不可分离的密切关系。这些女同志，在人民解放战争二年中，经过了严重的考验，她们为人民服务，为妇女解放的革命意志是更加坚定了。她们的光辉斗争事迹，在伟大的游击战争纪事中，是不可磨灭的。
