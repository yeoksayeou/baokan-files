　　Knowingly Wrong, Persistently Uncorrected
    Song Xiye of Xiyizhi Village Wrongfully Distributes Floating Wealth of Middle Peasants;
  　Leaders of Pingshan Should Immediately Rectify
    [Report from Our Newspaper] Last winter, during the land reform in Song Xiye Village, Second District of Pingshan, nine households were classified as rich peasants, and their surplus grain, furniture, and other property were confiscated. Two rich peasant households were beaten while pursuing floating wealth. At the general meeting, the "prosperous middle peasants" (class status not yet clearly defined in the whole village) were called upon to contribute their surplus grain (grain that could not be eaten before this year's wheat harvest was considered surplus) and furniture to help poor peasants to stand up. Out of the 116 households in the village, 22 households at that time (two households that hired long-term laborers every year before the land reform two years prior, eight households that hired half a long-term laborer or small long-term laborer after the incident, four households that hired long-term laborers before the incident but not after, and eight households that never hired laborers) voluntarily contributed 20 *shi* of grain, 24 pieces of various furniture such as pots, hoes, and shovels, five trees, 30 boards, 25 large urns, four items of clothing and bedding, one house, half a manure field, 11 sheep, half a cow, and one pig. Most of the contributed items were not taken out at the time, but fingerprints were placed on the recorded lists. Some cadres of the poor peasant association said: "Once they contribute, the poor peasants will be waiting to eat, and fingerprints are to prevent them from regretting it." Talking about the situation of contributing things at that time, poor peasant association cadres Song Baoxian, Song Sandong, etc., said: "Other villages are making a lot of noise, but in our village, they contributed as soon as we mentioned it." The middle peasants who contributed things said: "Someone told us before that we had to contribute, or it wouldn't work." "With people being hung up on big ropes just a moment ago, who would dare not to contribute!" Regarding not infringing on the interests of middle peasants, some poor peasant association cadres said: Comrade Lao Chai from the work team said that other villages are returning things to middle peasants, but in our village, middle peasants don't need to take anything out. In March of this year, a meeting was held for the households that contributed things, and they did not say they were unwilling. This spring, because the higher authorities called for increasing production, the cadres discussed and let them take back half of the contributed grain. And they said at the general meeting: "It doesn't matter if those who contributed things don't take them out." But when Ren Yinglu, one of the contributing households, went to other contributing households to discuss "Is it okay not to take it out?", the cadres found out and said: "If he doesn't take it out, he is colluding with others not to take it out!" Therefore, they called him to confess at the general meeting once. At the beginning of July this year, when distributing the fruit, these contributing households were asked to take out half of the contributed grain, and most of the other things were taken out and distributed together with the things confiscated from the rich peasants. Although the cadres of the poor peasant association and the new peasant association knew that "the middle peasants are only saying they are willing to take things out, but they are actually unwilling," they also said: "If they don't take it out this time, they are afraid they will have to take out more in the future!" "He contributed last winter, so even if he is unwilling, he has to struggle to take it out." They admitted that this was infringing on the interests of middle peasants, but they also said: "We are talking about the poor peasants standing up, if we stop the prosperous middle peasants from taking things out, wouldn't we be infringing on the interests of the poor peasants again?" Although Comrade Chai Huanwen from the work team knew that infringing on the interests of middle peasants was violating the Party's policy, he said: "In principle, prosperous middle peasants should not contribute." But he also said: "Wouldn't not accepting it affect the interests of the poor peasants?" When rectifying, he said: "I didn't definitively say to return it, I said that whoever is unwilling to take it out doesn't have to." He further explained: "People in Pingshan have a habit, face is the most important thing. They have said it at the general meeting, and they feel it would be bad if they didn't take it out, but they may not really be willing in their hearts." He also said: "It was said twice at the general meeting, and a meeting was held for the contributing households, which objectively formed consent, and it seemed that they had to take it out. The cadres discussed it again and again, and unified reduced it by half, and everyone was very happy." Although Comrade Chai Huanwen went back to the district to attend a meeting during this fruit distribution, he knew the specific plan for the fruit distribution. He also came to the village to check once during the fruit distribution process, and the fruit was not completely distributed until July 18th. Now the middle peasants in the village say: "We still have to produce, and our lives are better than before: no one is frugal anymore." Some say: "The more we produce, the more we have to contribute." (Xiao Jia, Li Zao)

　　明知不对，坚持不改
    宋西冶错分中农浮财
  　平山领导上应立即纠正
    【本报讯】平山二区宋西冶村去冬土改时，划了九户富农，征收了他们多余的粮食、家具及其他财产。在追浮财时吊打了两户富农。在大会上并号召“富裕中农”（全村还未划清阶级）自已多余的粮食（到今年麦夏以前吃不完的即为多余）和家具，帮助贫农翻身。全村一一六户，当时有二十二户（前年土改前每年雇长工的两户，事变后雇过半个长工或小长工的八户，事变前雇过长工、事变后没雇过的四户，从来没雇过的八户）自献粮食二十石，锅、锄、锨等各种家具二十四件，树五棵，板三十块，大瓮二十五个，衣被四件，房一处，粪场半个，羊十一只，牛半头，猪一口。献的东西，当时绝大部分都没拿出来，但在记录的单子上都打了手印。有些贫农团干部说：“他们献了，贫农们就等着吃哩，打手印是防止他们后悔。”谈到当时献东西的情形，贫农团干部宋保贤，宋三冬等说：“别的村闹的挺厉害，我们村一说就献啦。”献东西的中农说：“以前有人告诉给的，不献不行。”“一边吊着大绳刚吊过别人，谁敢不献！”关于不侵犯中农利益，有的贫农团干部说：工作组老柴说过，别的村有给中农退东西的，咱村中农不用往出拿啦。今年三月里开了一个献东西户的会，他们都没有说不愿意。今年春天因为上级号召要提高生产，干部讨论，献的粮食都让他们拿一半。并在大会上说：“献了东西的不出也不怎的”。但自献户任英禄找到别的自献户去商量“不出行不行”时，干部发觉了即说：“他不出还串通别人不出！”因此叫他在大会上坦白了一次。今年七月初分配果实时，叫这些自献户把献的粮食拿出了一半，其他东西绝大部分都拿出来，与征收的富农东西一同分了。贫农团和新农会的干部虽然知道“中农愿意往出拿东西不过是个嘴，实际上不愿意。”但他们又说：“这次不拿，他们怕以后拿多的！”“他去年冬天献了，不愿意也得挣扎着拿出来。”他们承认这是侵犯中农利益，但又说：“说的是贫农翻身，要是档住不让富裕中农拿，不又侵犯了贫农的利益啦？”工作组柴焕文同志虽然知道侵犯了中农利益是违背党的政策，曾说：“按说富裕中农不应当献”。但又说：“不接受时这不影响贫农利益？”在纠正时，他说：“我没有肯定的说给往回退，我说过谁不愿意出不用出。”他又解释说：“平山人有个习惯，脸面第一。他们在大会上说过，觉着不拿出来不好看，心眼里不一定真愿意拿。”又说：“大会上说过两次，开过一次献东西户的会，客观上形成同意，看情形非拿不行。干部们又商量了商量，统一的减了一半，大家都很欢喜。”这次分果实时，柴焕文同志虽然回区去开会，但分果实的具体计划他都知道。分果实过程中他还到村来检查过一次，果实到七月十八号才分完。现在村中中农说：“生产还得生产，生活上比以前好啦：谁也不省着细着的过啦。”有的则说：“多生产还得多献呢。”（萧甲·立早）
