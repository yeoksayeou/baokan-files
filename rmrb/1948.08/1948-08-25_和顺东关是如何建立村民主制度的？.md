How Was the Villager Democracy System Established in Heshun Dongguan?

The Heshun Dongguan Village People's Representative Conference has done many beneficial things for the masses, enjoys high prestige, and is supported by the masses. However, because the relationship between the branch, the People's Representative Conference, and the village government has not been clarified for a long time, and party member cadres and the masses have not yet skillfully used these institutions, the enthusiasm of various organizations and party member cadres has been limited. The problems discovered in the mass discussions and the solutions are introduced below for research.

I. What problems exist between the branch, the People's Representative Conference, and the village government?

(1) The branch abandons leadership. No meetings are held, no discussions take place, the tasks of party members are not clear, and the division of labor is not specific. After the establishment of the new institutions, some party members do not know how to work. For example, party member Peng Laixi did not work because he did not know how to do it. He said: "Party members should not be like this, but I can't help it. In the past, everything was discussed by the branch, but now I don't even know." (2) The People's Representative Conference has become an administrative organ, taking on everything. After the democratic rectification of the Party, the People's Representative Conference has a high prestige among the masses. The masses recognize that the People's Representative Conference is the highest authority and can solve problems. Therefore, problems such as divorce, marriage, villagers' disputes, and even corruption are brought to the chairman of the People's Representative Conference for resolution. The chairman of the People's Representative Conference handles whatever he encounters, but he does not dare to solve it alone. Therefore, sometimes even solving a small problem requires a meeting of the People's Representative Conference for discussion. There is no clear division of labor between the People's Representative Conference and the village government. (3) Because it is not clear what the respective tasks of the People's Representative Conference and the village government are, and the new cadres lack experience in their work, have few methods, and are cautious in their thinking, fearing to make mistakes, they have to discuss everything with the People's Representative Conference and do not dare to solve problems independently. This forms a situation where the People's Representative Conference discusses and the village government cadres run errands. In short, after the rectification of the Party, the new branch committee lacks new leadership methods, and the representatives of the Farmers' Representative Conference and the cadres of the village government lack work experience (they are mostly active and responsible in their work, which is good). Therefore, the relationship between the various organizations is not clear, the division of labor is not specific, and the collective leadership role and organizational role of the various organizations cannot be fully utilized, resulting in a heavy task for a few key cadres, while other party members and cadres feel that they have nothing to do.

The occurrence of the above problems is primarily due to the work team's long-term personal leadership, which did not pay attention to cultivating and educating cadres, establishing new leadership styles and working methods, forming the cadres' reliance (this is the evil consequence of paternalism - editor). On the other hand, the work team itself is not clear enough about the relationship between the branch, the People's Representative Conference, the village government, and other organizations, so the division of labor problem has not been well resolved. Secondly, the main responsible cadres in the various organizations are not good at collective leadership. For example, Du Sibao, the chairman of the People's Representative Conference (secretary of the branch), although he was the former chairman of the Farmers' Association, feels difficulty in leadership because he has not had the training to master the overall work. The deputy director of the village government committee and the vice chairman of the People's Representative Conference are new cadres who emerged during the rectification of the Party. Although they can be active and responsible in their work, they lack leadership experience and do not know how to give play to everyone's role. In addition, some individual party members who have served as cadres in the past have a disaffected mood in their thinking, believing that they cannot do things if they are not cadres. For the above reasons, the branch party members and the People's Representative Conference and the village government are not ideologically and actionally consistent, making it impossible to carry out the work better.

II. How did we solve these problems?

First, a branch meeting was held to carry out free thinking, mobilize party members to talk about their feelings, make suggestions to the leadership, and criticize each other; and concentrate on problems for everyone to discuss in order to clarify the tasks of party members. Party member Feng Linmei said: "I didn't do a good job before, mainly because I was wrong. A Communist Party member should never do nothing." Party member Li Baolong said: "After the rectification of the Party, I carried a big burden on my mind. I was somewhat selfish and unwilling to be a cadre, afraid of working, and only cared about my own labor, so I didn't do a good job." After checking the shortcomings, we discussed and determined the village-level democratic system and established the correct relationship between the Party and the People's Representative Conference: (1) For the Party's central tasks and major issues in the village at each period, as well as the work policy, the branch should actively strive to study first, make resolutions, publicize them among the masses, and the secretary of the branch should represent the branch to put forward its own views and suggestions for discussion by the People's Representative Conference (but the People's Representative Conference does not necessarily have to wait for the branch to study before holding a meeting, it can hold a meeting freely). After the decision is made, the branch will convene a meeting of party members to divide the work and ensure implementation. If the People's Representative Conference does not pass it, the branch must re-examine whether its views are correct and whether they need to be revised; if the branch's views are correct and still cannot be passed after publicity and explanation, the party members should abide by the decision of the People's Representative Conference, but do not give up continuing to publicize their views until the People's Representative Conference can pass it. (2) Strictly enforce the organizational life of the branch, specifically stipulate the branch meeting system, and the content of the group meetings and branch meetings should implement the mutual assistance and criticism system and the work inspection system in addition to learning. (3) The People's Representative Conference is the highest authority in the village and only makes resolutions on issues related to the whole village, which are then executed by the village government. Such as production and construction, burdens, relief, land measurement, etc. All other specific issues (such as marriage) are the responsibility of the village government. (4) The village government is the executive body, fully implements the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, and reports its work to the People's Representative Conference regularly. In addition, it is stipulated that old cadres should help new cadres, and that they should learn from each other to improve. After solving ideological problems and specifically discussing future methods, the morale of all party members was improved, and everyone said: "In this way, we will have methods for future work!"

### 和顺东关是如何建立村民主制度的？

　　和顺东关是如何建立村民主制度的？
    和顺东关村人民代表会，给群众办了许多有益的事，威信很高，得到群众拥护。但由于支部、人代会、村政府的相互关系长期没弄清楚，党员干部和群众还不会熟练的运用这些机构，因而限制了各个组织及党员干部的积极性。现将群众讨论中发现的问题和解决办法介绍于下，以供研究。
    一、支部、人代会、村政府间存在些什么问题？
    （一）支部放弃领导。不开会不讨论，党员任务不明确，分工不具体，一部分党员在新的机构建立后，不知道怎样去做工作。如党员彭来喜因为不知道如何去做，所以就没作工作。他说：“党员虽不应这样，但我也没办法，过去啥事情也经过支部研究，现在连知道也不知道。”（二）人代会上形成事务机关，一切包揽。民主整党后，人代会在群众中的威信很高，群众认识到人代会是最高权力机关，能解决问题，因而离婚、结婚、村民的纠纷甚至腐化等问题，都找人代会主席解决。人代会主席是碰到就管，但又不敢独自解决，因此有时因解决一个小问题也得开人代会讨论，人代会和村政府没有具体明确的分工。（三）因为不明确人代会和村政府各自的任务是什么，新干部做工作又缺乏经验，办法少，思想上小心谨慎，怕犯了错误，啥事情也得和人代会讨论，不敢单独解决问题。形成人代会讨论，村政府干部跑腿。总之，经过整党后，新的支委缺乏新的领导方法，农代会代表、村政府干部缺乏工作经验（在工作上大多是积极负责，这是好的），因而各组织的关系不明确，分工不具体，不能充分的发挥各个组织的集体领导作用与组织作用，形成少数主要干部任务繁重，其他党员和干部感到没有事干。
    发生以上诸问题，首先是由于工作组长期的亲自领导工作，没有注意培养教育干部，建立新的领导作风与工作方法，形成干部的依靠（这是包办代替的恶果——编者）。另一方面工作组本身对支部、人代会、村政府等各个组织之间的关系也不够明确，因之分工问题也就没有得到很好解决。其次是各个组织中的主要负责干部还不善于集体领导，如人代会主席（支书）杜四保，虽是前农会主席，但由于过去没有掌握全面工作的锻炼，现担负领导全村之责，在领导上就感觉困难，村政府副主任委员和人代会副主席是在整党中才涌现出来的新干部，工作虽能积极负责，但缺乏领导经验，不会发挥大家的作用。另外，有些过去当过干部的个别党员，思想上存在着不服情绪，认为不当干部无法做事。由于以上原因，造成支部党员和人代会、村政府思想上行动上不够一致，使工作不能更好的开展起来。
    二、我们是如何解决这些问题的。
    首先召开了支部会，开展自由思想，发动党员谈感觉，对领导提意见，互相批评；并集中问题让大家讨论以明确党员的任务。党员冯林梅说：“以前没有把工作做好，主要还是自己不对，共产党员啥时候也不能不做工作。”党员李保隆说：“整党以后我思想上背了个大包袱，自己有些自私自利，不想当干部，怕作工作，只管自己劳动，所以工作没作好。”经过检查缺点以后，便讨论确定村级民主制度，树立党与人代会的正确关系：（一）对于党每一时期的中心工作与村内发生的重大问题，以及工作方针等，支部应主动的争取先研究，做出决议，在群众中进行宣传，并由支书代表支部提出自己的主张，建议人代会讨论（但人代会不必定等支部研究后再开会，它可自由开会）。决定后支部再召开党员会进行分工，保证执行。如果人代会通不过，支部就要重新审查自己的主张是否正确，是否需要修正；如果支部的主张是正确的，经过宣传解释仍然不能通过，党员应该服从人代会的决议，但不放弃继续宣传自己的主张，直至人代会能够通过为止。（二）严格支部的组织生活，具体规定支部会议制度，内容除学习外，小组会及支部会要执行互助批评制度及检查工作制度。（三）人代会是全村的最高权力机关，只把有关全村性的问题作成决议，交由村政府执行。如生产建设、负担、救济、丈地等。其他一切具体问题（如婚姻等问题）由村政府负责处理。（四）村政府是执行机关，全部执行人代会的决议，定期向人代会报告工作。此外并规定老干部要帮助新干部，要相互学习提高，经过解决思想问题，又具体讨论了今后的办法，全体党员同志情绪提高，大家都说：“这样今后工作就有办法啦！”
