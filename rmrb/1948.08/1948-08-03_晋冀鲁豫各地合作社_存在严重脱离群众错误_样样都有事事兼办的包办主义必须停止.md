    Cooperatives in Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Areas
    Exist with Serious Errors of Detachment from the Masses
    The Paternalistic Approach of Handling Everything and Taking Care of Everything Must Be Stopped
    [Our Newspaper’s Report] Over the past seven or eight years, the cooperative movement in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan area has played a significant role in supporting mass production, and many cooperatives that serve the masses and are loved by the masses have emerged. However, currently, cooperatives in various regions also exhibit serious phenomena of detachment from the masses and detachment from production. This is mainly manifested in: (1) Many cooperatives' business operations do not cater to the needs of the masses, do not organize mass production, focus on formalism and ostentation, and simply pursue profits. As a result, they become detached from the masses and lose close contact with them. For example, the Jiliyan Village Cooperative in Qin County established oil mills, consumer cooperatives, and pharmacies when it was founded. Furniture occupied most of the capital, severely limiting business operations. In Wu'an County, after deducting debts and wages, only 14% of the capital was used for activities. Some cooperatives even abandoned their villages and went to towns to engage in speculative commerce, resulting in dispersed funds, detachment of cooperative business from mass production, and loss of mass base. (2) Many village cooperatives use the fruits of struggle as capital or village finances are invested in cooperative production. These matters have not been clearly explained to the masses of the village regarding whose shares these funds should be considered and who should own how many shares. Therefore, the relationship between the cooperative and the masses, as well as the direction of business, is affected. According to statistics from 226 village cooperatives in Wu'an County, among the 478,240,000 yuan of capital, more than 95,090,000 yuan were fruits of struggle invested under the auspices of the Farmers' Association, accounting for one-fifth of the total capital. In the Luoyang Village Cooperative of Shahe, the total capital was 3,650,000 yuan, and the fruits of struggle accounted for 2,160,000 yuan, nearly two-thirds of the total capital. Many people believe that the cooperative is village public property or property of childless families, not their own economic organization. Therefore, they would rather dissolve the cooperative and distribute the fruits of struggle. (3) Some cooperatives have serious chaotic phenomena of detachment from the masses, which are mainly manifested in the bureaucratization of cooperatives and long-term overdue accounts. Instead of starting from supporting mass production, many cooperatives set up stalls for oil mills, vinegar mills, flour mills, and dye houses, with workers, staff, and cadres all detached from production. Some even become places for cadres to embezzle and waste. The Madian Cooperative had six cadres and eight workers. The cadres received 3 dou of rice per month, the workers 1 shi of rice per month, and the daily food cost was 2 fen of rice and 1 fen of flour. The account settlement for January and February showed a profit of 600,000 yuan but expenditures of 800,000 yuan, resulting in a net loss of 200,000 yuan. Long-term overdue payments also seriously hinder the development of business. The Luoyang Village Cooperative of Shahe has a capital of 3,650,000 yuan, with outstanding debts of 1,510,000 yuan, nearly half of the capital. (4) After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, many places experienced "leftist" deviations in cooperative work, focusing solely on impoverished and hired peasant components, dismissing some cooperative cadres who could have continued working, weakening leadership, and affecting the development of cooperative business. Each cooperative in Wu'an County dismissed over 300 people. The Zhao Family Village Cooperative dismissed 14 of 20 leaving only six. The Luoyang Village Cooperative in Shahe dismissed the cooperative head Jiao Chenggong (middle peasant, carpenter), who was loved by the masses and skilled in technology, and replaced him with a poor peasant leader who was not skilled in business, resulting in the collapse of the cooperative. In some places, under the slogan of "poor and hired peasants running the house," hooligans were chosen as managers, who only wanted to bring down the cooperative and divide the money and goods. The Huangliushan Cooperative's flour mill was divided up, principal and interest included, by the "poor and hired." The cooperative collapsed, and the middle peasants were dissatisfied. In order to overcome the above-mentioned deviations, the Cooperation Department of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government has put forward preliminary opinions on reforming cooperatives, pointing out that cooperatives are mass-based economic organizations that serve the masses, and their main task is to organize and support mass production. We should strictly correct the bad phenomena of relying solely on speculation without engaging in production, cadres manipulating and controlling embezzlement and waste, and formalism in seeking credit from higher authorities. We should rectify business operations, generally avoiding making businesses too complex and pursuing the paternalistic approach of handling everything and taking care of everything, which must be stopped. We can plan to support or help develop small-scale cooperatives, making them a primary means of achieving comprehensive organization. Cooperatives in various regions should immediately resume all economic activities and return the frozen shares of middle peasants, landlords, and rich peasants. For some masses who want to withdraw their shares, we should conduct mass inspections and reforms based on the specific situation, repeatedly and thoroughly explain to the masses to dissuade them from withdrawing their shares. If the masses insist, their freedom to withdraw their shares should be respected, and they should not be forced to stay simply because of fear that the cooperative will collapse. Dividends should also be distributed on time, and the large-scale accumulation of profits into capital should not be forced. Outstanding debts should be handled separately based on the specific situation. Those who have used their positions as village cadres to delay payments for a long time should be immediately pursued. The debts of the masses should also be made to repay them. For the poor and destitute, their production should be organized to earn money to repay their debts. The fruits of struggle occupied by cooperatives should be quickly and reasonably distributed through mass participation in the democratic replenishment movement. Villages that have not yet conducted replenishment should operate as usual, and the Poor Peasants' Association or Farmers' Representatives Meeting should handle the matter during the democratic replenishment. Village financial shares should receive dividends like other shares, and village cadres should not arbitrarily interfere with cooperative business because of this. Cooperative cadres and their leading organizations should be democratic elected, honest, upright, and have considerable business experience farmers or other laborers. Every member should have the same rights to vote, to be elected, and other various rights. Cooperative expenses must be discussed and approved by the members' meeting. Public welfare funds and public accumulation funds should have a certain limit, generally not exceeding 15% of the net profit, and it should be ensured that the funds are used for proper purposes and are not borrowed by cadres or any individual. The cadres and operations of the cooperative should be democratically supervised by the members' meeting or its representative organization. Only by specifically resolving the above issues can we smoothly carry out the large-scale production movement.

    晋冀鲁豫各地合作社
    存在严重脱离群众错误
    样样都有事事兼办的包办主义必须停止
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫区的合作运动，七八年来在扶助群众生产上曾起了不少作用，出现了不少为群众服务、受群众爱戴的合作社。但目前各地合作社同时存在着严重的脱离群众、脱离生产的现象。这主要表现在：（一）不少合作社经营业务不根据群众需要，不组织群众生产，形式主义的铺张门面，单纯的追逐利润。因此脱离群众，与群众失去了密切联系。如沁县祭力岩村合作社，在成立时建立油坊、消费社，又开设药铺，家具占了大部资金，业务经营遭受极大限制。武乡全县合作社除外欠及工资占用外，活动资本仅占百分之十四，有些合作社则脱离本村到城镇去专门经营投机商业，结果资金分散，合作社业务脱离了群众生产，丧失了群众基础。（二）不少村庄的合作社占用斗争果实作资金，或以村财政投入合作社生产，这些均未向全村群众交代明白，究竟这些资金应该算谁的股份，谁应该占多少股份，因此，影响了合作社与群众的关系及业务方向。据武安县二二六个村的合作社统计，在四亿七千八百廿四万余元的资金中，有九千五百零九万余元是在农会包办下投入的斗争果实，占全部资金五分之一。沙河洛阳村合作社总资金三百六十五万余元，斗争果实就有二百十六万元，几占总资金三分之二。不少群众认为合作社是村公产或绝户产，不认为它是自己的经济组织，因此宁愿解散合作社而分斗争果实。（三）某些合作社存在着严重的脱离群众的混乱现象，这主要表现在合作社的机关化与长期的拖欠帐目上。不少合作社不从扶植群众生产出发，而是油坊、醋坊、粉坊、染坊样样摆一个摊子，工人、职员、干部一律脱离生产。有的甚至成为干部贪污浪费的场所。马店合作社有干部六人，工人八人，干部一月三斗米，工人一月一石米，每天伙食二米一面，正二月结帐盈利六十万元，就开支八十万元，净赔二十万元。长期拖欠也严重的妨害了业务的发展，沙河洛阳村合作社资金三百六十五万余元，外欠一百五十一万元，几占资金的一半。（四）土地法大纲颁布后，不少地方在合作社工作中产生了左的偏向，单纯强调贫雇成份，把一些本来可以工作的合作社干部也解职了，削弱了领导，影响了合作社业务发展。武乡各社解职三百余人，赵家庄合作社二十人，只留下六人，沙河洛阳村把群众爱戴、技术熟练的合作社长焦成功（中农、木匠）解职了，换上业务不熟练的贫农领导，结果合作社垮了台。有些地方在“贫雇当家”的口号下，选了二流子当经理，这些人净想把合作社搞垮分钱分货。黄粟山合作社粉坊被“贫雇”连本带利都分了。合作社垮台，中农不满。为了克服上述各种偏向，晋冀鲁豫边区政府合作厅特提出改造合作社的初步意见，指出合作社是为群众服务的群众性的经济组织，它的主要任务是组织与扶植群众生产。应严格纠正光靠投机不事生产，干部操纵把持贪污浪费、以及向上级要功的形式主义的不良现象。清理业务，一般的不应使业务太复杂，追求样样都有事事兼办的包办主义，必须停止。可有计划的扶植或帮助发展小型社，使它真正成为达到全面组织起来的一种主要生产方式。各地合作社应立即恢复一切经济活动，退还中农及地富被冻结的股金。有些群众愿意抽股，应根据具体情况，进行群众性的检查改造，反复深入的向群众解释，使不抽股；如群众坚持，则应尊重其抽股的自由，不能因害怕合作社垮台而再强加群众。分红也应按期，不能强迫将红利大量的积累成资金。外欠应根据具体情况分别处理。村干利用特权长期拖欠的应立即追回。群众的拖欠，亦应使之归还。对贫苦者应该组织其生产，赚钱还帐。合作社占用斗争果实，在民主填补运动中应迅速通过群众合理分配，分配后再动员群众入股，但不能强迫。未进行填补的村庄，应照常经营，俟民主填补时由贫农团或农代会处理。村财政股金应与其他股金同样分红，各村干不能因此而任意干涉合作社业务。合作社干部及其领导组织，应是民主选举诚实正派并有相当业务经验的农民或其他劳动者来充任。每个社员都应有同样的选举权与被选举权及其他各种权利。合作社经费开支须经过社员大会讨论批准。公积金、公益金要有一定限额，一般不能超过纯红利百分之十五，并保证该款用途正当，不容干部及任何个人借用。合作社的干部、业务都要经过社员大会或其代表组织的民主监督。只有把以上各问题具体解决以后，才能顺利开展大生产运动。
