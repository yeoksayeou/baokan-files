　　Lack of Concrete Leadership Promotes
    Collapse of Most Pingshan Cooperatives
  　Leadership Should Examine Causes and Provide Support
    [Our Newspaper] The cooperative movement in Pingshan County once developed to the point of having one cooperative per village and one joint cooperative per district. It played a certain role in supporting mass production and solving the difficulties of daily necessities for the masses. However, due to some problems in the direction and leadership in the past, especially after the land reform last year, according to Director Li of the County Promotion Society (formerly Director of the County Joint Cooperative): about two-thirds of the cooperatives in the county have now collapsed. In the 21 villages of Xihuishe, Xiye, and Rongcun in the Second District, 16 village cooperatives have collapsed, and only five are barely surviving. According to Director Li of the County Promotion Society and Minister Fu of the Business Department, the reasons for the collapse of the cooperatives are as follows: (1) The cooperative used to have its own organizational structure—county joint cooperatives, district joint cooperatives, village cooperatives, etc. There was a leadership system—two cadres from the district joint cooperative regularly went to the countryside to inspect work. After the land reform, the cooperative cadres all went down to engage in land reform. After the establishment of the Promotion Society this spring, the county and district joint cooperatives were abolished. The Promotion Society had a guiding relationship with the village cooperatives. In fact, the Production Guidance Department (i.e., the Industrial Department) had only one or two cadres for a long time and had not led the cooperatives at all. The village cooperatives lost leadership, and their work came to a standstill. After the establishment of the Production Promotion Society, nearly 20 million yuan of funds that had been collected throughout the county were all returned to the village cooperatives and private shareholders. According to Minister Fu: some of the returned funds were used to buy things and left idle, some were divided up, and some were spent as village funds or borrowed and spent, failing to be used for production. (2) After the land reform, some cooperatives were liquidated, and their funds were divided up, leading to collapse. The Nanwanglou Village Cooperative had 300,000 yuan in funds the year before last, and last year it collected one jin of wheat per member as share capital. It was doing well for more than a year. After the land reform, the masses audited the accounts of the cooperative. Although no problems were found, the village cooperative director was detained for more than 20 days, and the funds of the cooperative were all divided up. The Banshan Cooperative in the Sixth District operated a consumer store and a flour mill, and the masses supported it very much. After the land reform, the work team went to the village and said: there are many cases of corruption in cooperatives. The accounts of the cooperative were liquidated, and as a result, the flour mill stopped working, the pigs were sold at a low price, the director quit, and the funds were left idle. (3) Some cooperatives did not have a clear policy of supporting mass production, and they only engaged in simple consumer operations (oil, salt, alkali, matches, paper, etc.) with little capital. After the district joint cooperatives were abolished, no one supplied goods, and the village cooperatives had no way to circulate funds. Some villages lost money due to too many debts and inability to manage physical goods. In particular, village expenses and some village cadres deliberately incurring debts had a significant impact on the collapse of the cooperatives. (4) Problems in village cooperatives could not be resolved. The Mixiye Village Cooperative originally had four or five shi of wheat in funds, and last year it still had 120,000 yuan, but this year it only has 230 jin of rice and wheat. The masses reported that there was corruption, but it was not dealt with. The problem of the village cooperative cadres' allowances has never been properly resolved, affecting their enthusiasm for management. The director of the Donggangshang Village Cooperative was away carrying a stretcher for several months, and the accountant was a liquidated household, leaving the village cooperative work unattended. Our reporter believes that the current situation of the collapse of most Pingshan cooperatives should be seriously noted by the leadership. Education on the operating policy of supporting mass production should be clearly carried out among cadres to correct cooperative policies, strengthen leadership, allocate appropriate cadres, enforce strict systems, clear up outstanding debts and funds, and fully exert the role of the cooperative cause in organizing and supporting mass production.

　　缺乏具体领导推动
    平山合作社大部垮台
  　领导上应检查原因予以扶植
    【本报讯】平山县的合作事业在过去曾发展到一村一社，一区一联社，在扶助群众生产，解决群众日用品困难上曾起了一定作用，但由于过去方向上，领导上发生了一些问题，特别是在去年土改以后，据县推进社栗主任（原县联社主任）谈：现在全县合作社约有三分之二垮台。二区西回舍、西冶、荣村等二十一个村中，有十六个村社垮了台，只有五个还勉强支持着。合作社垮台的原因，据县推进社栗主任、营业部傅部长谈，有以下几种：（一）合作社过去有它一套组织——县联社、区联社、村社等。有领导制度——区联社有两个干部经常下乡检查工作，土改后合作社干部都下去搞土改，今春成立推进社以后，县、区联社取消，推进社对村社成为指导关系，实际上生产指导部（即实业科）很长时期只有一两个干部，根本没有领导过合作社。村社失掉领导、工作便告停顿，生产推进社成立后，把全县已经集中起来的近两万万元的资金全部退给村社与私人股东。据傅部长谈：退回去的资金有的买了东西放着，有的分了，有的当作村款开支或借着花了，未能用于生产。（二）土改以后，有些合作社被清算，资金被分而垮台。南望楼村社前年有资金三十万元，去年又征收了每个社员一斤麦子股金。一年多搞的还好。土改后群众算合作社的帐目，虽没有算出毛病，也把村社主任押了二十多天，合作社的资金也都分了。六区板山合作社经营消费与粉房，群众还很拥护，土改后工作组到村说：合作社有贪污现象的多，清算合作社的帐目，结果粉房停了工，猪也贱价卖了，主任也不干了，资金还放着。（三）有些合作社扶植群众生产的方针不明确，单纯经营消费（油、盐、碱、洋火、纸张等）资金又少，区联社取消后没人供给货物，村社资金更没办法流通。有的村因赊欠帐目多，掌握不住实物赔了钱。特别是村开支与一些村干部故意赊帐，对合作社垮台关系很大。（四）村社有问题不能解决。米西冶村社原有资金四五石麦子，去年还有资金十二万，今年则只存米麦二百三十斤。群众反映说其中有贪污，并没有处理。村社干部的勤务问题，始终没有得到适当解决，影响经营情绪，东岗上村社主任出远征担架走了好几个月，会计又是被清算户，弄得村社工作没人管。记者认为目前平山合作社大部垮台的情况，领导上应严重注意。应在干部中明确进行扶植群众生产的经营方针的教育，端正合作政策，加强领导，配备适当干部，严格制度，清理外欠、资金，充分发挥合作事业组织与扶助群众生产的作用。
