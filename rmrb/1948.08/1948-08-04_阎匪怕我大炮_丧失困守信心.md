    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 2nd. In the Jinzhong battle, the People's Liberation Army captured a document issued by Yan bandit's Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters reviewing the failure at Linfen. This document fully demonstrates Yan bandit's extreme fear of our intense artillery fire and loss of confidence in holding cities by relying on fortifications. The document stated that the People's Liberation Army had "ample supplies of various shells, and when attacking us (the enemy referring to themselves, same below), they used concentrated volley fire, making it impossible for our heavy weapons to be raised. When the enemy (referring to the People's Liberation Army, same below) attacked Dongguan, they first concentrated artillery fire to fiercely bombard the eastern city wall, making it impossible for our defending soldiers on the wall to monitor, and then took the opportunity to swarm in, breaking into the gate and cutting off and encircling our inner trench defenders." The document lamented the uselessness of the fortifications, stating: "The high碉(diāo blockhouse) in the suburbs of Linfen were almost completely destroyed by enemy artillery fire, rendering them useless. The enemy used our outer trenches as hiding places for attacking the city walls and attacked from tunnels, making our heavy weapons completely unusable. The effectiveness of barbed wire was minimal, and the inner trenches were as good as nonexistent." Yan bandit felt even more unable to cope with the People's Liberation Army's close-quarters combat. The document stated: "The enemy's equipment was well-prepared in advance, lightweight, complete, and the methods were quick and effective, making it difficult to destroy." According to Yan bandit's own review, this shows that the Taiyuan fortifications, for which thousands upon thousands of碉(diāo blockhouse) have been built and are still being built by forcing the people to work harder, are also unable to resist the People's Liberation Army's attacks.

    阎匪怕我大炮
    丧失困守信心
    【新华社晋绥二日电】解放军于晋中战斗中，缴获阎匪太原绥署印发之检讨临汾失败之文件一件，其中充分表现出阎匪对我猛烈炮火感到惊恐万分，对依靠堡垒困守城市，已丧失信心。该文件称：解放军“各种炮弹颇充足，打我们（敌自称，下同）完全用的是排子炮集中射击，使我们的重武器不能抬头。敌（指解放军，下同）攻东关时，先集中炮火猛烈向东城墙射击，使我城上守兵无法监视，即乘机蜂拥而上，突入关内，将我内壕守兵遮断包围。”该件哀鸣所作工事毫无作用称：“临汾城郊高碉，几全数被敌炮摧毁，毫无用处。敌人利用我外壕作了进攻城墙的藏伏窝，从坑道攻击，使我重武器完全用不上。铁丝网效力甚小，内壕也是有壕等于无壕。”阎匪对解放军的近战作业，更感到无法应付。该件称：解放军“器具均因事先妥有准备，轻便齐全，方法迅速适用，又快又利，不易破坏。”根据阎匪自己的这个检讨，说明筑了成千成万碉堡工事现在还正驱使人民加紧修筑的太原工事，同样不能抵抗解放军的攻击。
