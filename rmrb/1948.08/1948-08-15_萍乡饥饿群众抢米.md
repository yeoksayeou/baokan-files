Xinhua News Agency, North China, 13th. According to the Tianjin Dagong Bao, July 16th: Pingxiang, an important coal-producing city on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line at the junction of Jiangxi and Hunan, recently experienced a riot of hungry people seizing rice due to soaring prices. On June 29th, Huang Linji Rice Shop in West Main Street of the city was looted, and all the white rice was taken away. Even the 200+ *shi* of unhusked rice stored in the upper floor was also looted. The looting quickly spread to other rice shops. The Kuomintang police bureau dispatched a large number of police to suppress the riot, and several rice-grabbing people were arrested on the spot. A large number of hungry people then angrily went to the Kuomintang county government to petition and protest. Another group of hungry people went to Yuansheng Sheng and Xiesheng Rice Shops and Shunhe Rice Mill on North Zheng Street to demand the purchase of rice at a fair price, and several more riots occurred.

　　萍乡饥饿群众抢米
    【新华社华北十三日电】据天津大公报七月十六日讯：浙赣铁路线上赣湘交界处之重要产煤城市萍乡，近因物价狂涨，爆发饥饿群众抢米的骚动。六月二十九日，该市内西大街黄林记米号被抢，所有白米均被抢光，连楼接待碾存谷也抢去二百多石。抢风迅速扩展到其他米店，国民党警局派出大批警察，实行镇压，当场有抢米群众数人被捕。大批饥饿群众遂愤而转至国民党县府门前请愿抗议。另批饥民又至北正街元盛生、协胜两米号及顺和碾米厂要求平价购米，再度发生骚动数起。
