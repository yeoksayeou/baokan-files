The Landlord's Home

This book is one of the world's famous works praised by Gorky. The author, Shchedrin, was famous in Russian literary circles at the time for his ability to expose and satirize the evils and darkness of the old society. The story tells the story of the decline and destruction of a Russian landlord family – the Golovlyov family – around the time of the abolition of serfdom (around 1861). The story points out that the Golovlyov family (the representative of the Russian landlord class) is doomed to have no way out other than demise due to: 1. the general lack of productive capacity of family members; 2. greed, laziness, and alcoholism. Under the author's profound strokes, the dark life of the landlord family is so piercing that it makes people feel that it is simply a disgrace to humanity if this class—the landlord class—is not sent to the grave.

Comparing Russia in this book with the Soviet Union today will more vividly tell everyone that landlords—as a class—must perish in every corner of the world (wherever landlords exist), and they must perish. At the same time, after eliminating this class that hinders the development of social productive forces, human society will enter a new era of development.

    地主之家
    这本书，是高尔基所推崇的世界名著之一。作者谢德林，以善于揭露和讽刺旧社会的罪恶与黑暗，著称于当时俄国的文坛。故事的内容，是叙述农奴制度废除前后（一八六一年前后），一家俄国地主——戈罗维略夫家的没落和毁灭。故事指明了，戈罗维略夫家（俄国地主阶级的代表），由于：一、家族成员，一般的缺乏生产能力；二、贪婪、怠惰和酗酒；注定了这个阶级除灭亡以外，没有任何别的出路。在作者深沉的笔触下面，地主家庭的阴暗生活，是这样的刺人心目，以至使人觉得如果不把这个阶级——地主阶级，送进坟墓，简直就是人类的一种耻辱。
    把这本书里的俄国，和今天的苏联，对比起来看，将更生动的告诉大家：地主——作为一个阶级，在世界的每一个角落（只要是有地主存在的地方），都必须灭亡，而且一定要灭亡。同时，当消灭了这个阻碍社会生产力发展的阶级之后，人类社会，便将走进一个新的发展时代。
