　　Correct Wage Policy
　　Rectify Production Organization
　　Initial Successes of Public Factories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] The machine repair factory, match factory, textile factory, chemical factory, tannery, etc., under the Industry Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office, have achieved preliminary results in correcting wage policies and rectifying production organizations. Since June, these factories have overcome egalitarianism in wages, boldly promoted and used technical workers, and increased their compensation. For example, Li Peiwen, the head of the machinist team at the machine repair factory, and Chang Guihe, a technician, were promoted to engineers, and Li Peiwen's technical grade was raised by one level and two grades. Apprentices who previously had high wages now have appropriately reduced wages. After correcting the wage policy in the machine repair factory, match factory, and textile factory, the original wage expenditure was reduced by 34%. In terms of simplifying the production organization, the phenomenon of multiple leadership was overcome. Only the engineering and management departments were set up, and the slogan "fewer people, more work" was put forward to reduce non-production personnel. The textile factory was reduced by 50%, and the machine repair factory was reduced by 19%. In the past, the ratio of production personnel to non-production personnel in production units was 4:1, now it is 6:1. Only carts, livestock carts were adjusted and increased according to production needs. After correcting the wage policy and rectifying the production organization, the phenomenon of wasted man-hours per month was reduced, and production enthusiasm was improved. In June, the average practical working hours of the textile factory, machine repair factory, and match factory were 89.4%, of which the practical working hours of the textile factory were 92.5%. The practical working hours of the machine repair factory were 87.3%, and the practical working hours of the match factory were 88.1%. Compared with the same period last year, the textile factory increased working hours by 18%. In the past, the highest record for weaving white cloth per person per day was 70 feet, now it can weave 110 feet, an increase of 27.7%. The match factory's pole arranging machine increased by 16.3%. The experience gained from the achievements are: First, the current poor management of public factories is mainly due to the bureaucratization of production organizations, the supply perspective in management, and the lack of a strict accounting system in production, resulting in waste and a lack of attention to sales, making good goods become cold goods. Workers said, "The factory loses money mainly because it doesn't know how to manage the factory," which is the truth. In the past, it was thought that talking about enterprise was a capitulationist idea, but now it proves that only by rectifying the production organization and emphasizing enterprise can we overcome bureaucratization and the supply perspective. Second, some workers agree with correcting the wage policy, while others oppose it. Those with technical skills agree, while those without technical skills or with low technical skills oppose it. Therefore, we must conduct in-depth deliberation and mobilization, and we cannot simply engage in it and use coercion. In this correction of the wage policy, the factories that did well did not have problems, and production enthusiasm was improved. The factories that did poorly had some problems, and some individual workers quit or went on strike. This is a big shortcoming in our work. Therefore, we must persuade and educate workers with practical examples and gradually improve them politically so that they can start from long-term interests. Generally speaking, workers cannot accept it ideologically at the beginning and only care about their personal wage income, but as long as we educate them well, we can convince them. For example, the textile factory first conducted investigation and research, determined to educate and mobilize, and within five or six days, the thinking of all the workers in the factory was straightened out. Third, after correcting the wage policy, workers demanded piecework and contracting. At this time, as long as we grasp the principle that it does not reduce quality and is conducive to production, and actively respond to the demands of the masses, the workers' enthusiasm will not only not decrease, but will also be quickly improved. For example, the textile factory implemented a piece-rate wage system. Before reducing wages, the highest output of weaving white cloth per person per day was 70 feet, now it is 110 feet. After the female workers in the match factory implemented piecework packaging, they used to pack six or seven plates per person per day, now they pack twelve plates.

### 端正工资政策　整顿生产组织　冀鲁豫公营工厂初获成绩

　　端正工资政策
  　整顿生产组织
  　冀鲁豫公营工厂初获成绩
    【冀鲁冀电】冀鲁豫行署工业处所属机器修理厂、火柴厂、纺织厂、化学厂、制革厂等，端正工资政策，整顿生产组织，已获初步成绩。各该工厂自六月份开始，克服工资中的平均主义，对技术工人，大胆提拔使用，提高待遇。如机器修理厂机工班长李培文，技师常贵河提升为工务员，又根据李培文的技术提高一级两等。工匠学徒，过去工资高，现在则适当降低。在机器修理厂、火柴厂、纺织厂端正工资政策后，比原有工资开支降低百分之三十四。简化生产组织方面，克服了过去多头领导现象。只设工务。经理两部，提出“人少多做事”口号，减少非生产人员。计纺织厂减少百分之五十，机器修理厂减少百分之十九，过去生产单位生产人员与非生产人员是四比一现在是六比一。只对车子、牲口大车按生产需要进行了调整和增减。经过端正工资政策和整顿生产组织后，减少了月工浪费工时现象，生产情绪提高。六月份纺织厂、机器修理厂、火柴厂三个厂平均实用工数百分之八十九点四，其中纺织厂实用工百分之九十二点五。机器修理厂实用工百分之八十七点三，火柴厂实用工百分之八十八点一。以纺织厂与去年同一时期比较，增加工时百分之一十八，过去每人每天织白洋布最高纪录七十尺，现在能织一百一十尺。提高百分之廿七点七。火柴厂排杆机提高百分之十六点三。获得成绩的几点体验是：第一、目前公营工厂经营管理不善，主要是生产组织机关化，经营管理上供给观点，生产上没有严格的核算制度，造成浪费，不注意推销，致使好货变成冷货。工人说“工厂赔本，主要是不会管理工厂”这是真理。过去认为讲企业化是投降思想，现在证明只有整顿生产组织，强调企业化，才能克服机关化和供给观点。第二、端正工资政策，有的工人赞成，有的工人反对，赞成的是有技术的，反对的是无技术或技术低的。因此我们必须深入的酝酿、动员，不能简单从事，强迫命令。这次端正工资政策中，做得好的工厂没出问题，使生产情绪提高。做得差的工厂就出了些问题，个别工人不干或怠工，这是我们工作中的很大缺点，因此，对工人必须以实际例子说服教育，从政治上逐步提高，使他们从长远利益出发。一般的说，工人在开始思想上接受不了，完全从个人工资收入计较，但只要我们很好的教育，是能够说服的。比如纺织工厂，他们先做调查研究，决心教育动员，在五、六天内全厂工人思想都打通了。第三、端正工资政策后工人要求记件、包工。这时只要我们掌握不降低质量有利于生产的原则，积极答应群众的要求，工人情绪不但不降低，而且很快被提高。如纺织工厂实行计件工资制。未减低工资前每人每天织白洋布最高七十尺，现在织一百一十尺。火柴厂女工包装实行计件后，过去每人每天装六七盘，现在装十二盘。
