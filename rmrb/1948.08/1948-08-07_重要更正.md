    In a portion of this newspaper's front-page headline on the sixth of this month, the seventh character, "钦" (qīn), in the ninth line was mistakenly printed as "欢" (huān). The seventeenth character in the eleventh line, the twenty-seventh character in the sixteenth line, and the eighth character in the twenty-first line from the end of the second news item, "尤" (yóu), were mistakenly printed as "元" (yuán). The third character in the thirteenth line of the headline news, the seventh character from the end in the sixteenth line, and the tenth character in the twentieth line from the end of the second news item, "楷" (kǎi), were mistakenly printed as "锴" (kǎi). We hereby issue this correction.
