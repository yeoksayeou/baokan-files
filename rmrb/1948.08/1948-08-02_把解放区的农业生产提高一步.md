    Further Improve Agricultural Production in the Liberated Areas

    The Chinese people's revolutionary war is currently at a critical juncture for victory. All liberated areas across the country must concentrate all efforts to win the nationwide victory of the revolutionary war. At the same time, the offensive posture and continuous victories of the revolutionary war have provided a relatively stable environment for most liberated areas, excluding those bordering the enemy and guerrilla zones. This environment can and must be utilized to restore and develop production in the liberated areas. It is imperative to rapidly restore and develop production in the liberated areas, raising it significantly above existing levels. This is the most fundamental and crucial task for securing the nationwide victory of the revolutionary war. Only by improving production in the liberated areas can we provide long-term and more effective support for the revolutionary war at the front. Only by improving production in the liberated areas can we improve the lives of the people, strengthen their unity, consolidate the liberated areas, and thereby, with full and concrete evidence, persuade the people of all China to quickly embark on the revolutionary path of New Democracy.

    Chairman Mao said: All cadres in Party and government organs in the rear, despite being extremely busy supporting the front, carrying out land reform, Party rectification, and collecting public grain, must dedicate at least half of their time, i.e., more than six months of the year, to organizing and guiding production. He also said: The most basic task for all base liberated areas is to increase production by even an inch. These instructions from Chairman Mao are the fundamental guidelines for our rear area work in all liberated areas.

    Chairman Mao also said: Currently, increasing production in the liberated areas must emphasize both industrial and agricultural production. This differs somewhat from the previous emphasis on agricultural production as the core. This is because the liberated areas are expanding, the population is increasing, and within the liberated areas, there are already many small and medium-sized cities, and large cities are beginning to emerge. Many modern factories, mines, and industrial areas have been liberated. Railways, highways, waterways, trains, automobiles, steamships, and wooden boats are already considerable in the liberated areas, and in the future, more cities, factories, railways, and waterways will be liberated. These should be the most precious gains for the people in the liberation war. We must make good use of these factories, mines, railways, highways, waterways, and all machinery to serve the victory of the revolutionary war and the improvement of the people's living standards. In addition to this, there are also extensive handicrafts and rural and urban household sideline production in the liberated areas. Some of these handicraft productions have been greatly developed due to the advocacy and support of the democratic government of the liberated areas, playing a huge role in the economic life of the liberated areas. However, some other handicraft productions have been damaged and reduced due to the war and the Kuomintang's criminal blockade. In the land reform, due to errors in the implementation of policies, handicraft production in some areas has also suffered some damage or temporary reduction. Restoring and developing the vast handicraft production in the liberated areas is also an extremely important task. Although machine production and handicraft production in the liberated areas are far less extensive than agricultural production, and their quantity is much smaller than agricultural production, the necessary position these industrial productions occupy in the entire socio-economic structure of the liberated areas is equally important as agricultural production. In particular, the destruction and shrinkage of industrial production, the lack of industrial products, and the high prices further highlight the importance and urgency of restoring and developing industrial production in the liberated areas. Therefore, except for those rural Party committees that only have agriculture and no industrial production, or those urban and factory Party committees that only have industry and commerce and no agricultural production, which should solely or mainly focus on developing agricultural production or industrial production as their production tasks, all other Party committees in areas with both agricultural and industrial production, especially high-level Party committees such as the Central Bureaus and District Party Committees, should place the development of industrial production and the development of agricultural production on an equal footing. Only in this way can the economy of the liberated areas embark on a healthier and more independent path of development.

    Various issues in developing industrial production in the liberated areas have been and will be discussed in specialized papers. Here, we will only discuss several issues in developing agricultural production in the liberated areas.

    Agricultural production is seasonal. This year's spring plowing has passed, and the summer harvest has been completed. Agricultural production in various parts of the liberated areas has already achieved initial results, more or less. In the future, the task in general areas is to continue summer hoeing and prepare for the autumn harvest. In areas bordering the enemy and guerrilla zones, it is necessary to do a good job in protecting grain. In some counties experiencing severe disasters, it is necessary to seize the opportunity and treat disaster relief as the only central task. However, generally speaking, all liberated areas should, starting now, especially taking advantage of the autumn and winter rainy season, fully complete all preparatory work for next year's major production campaign. This is because land reform in all base liberated areas has been largely completed, and the remaining parts are expected to be completed in the autumn and winter rainy season this year. By next year, it will be possible to launch a universal production movement in all base liberated areas, completely free from feudal shackles, where people of all strata can compete to produce and become wealthy under free and equal conditions.

    To improve agricultural production in the liberated areas, and to prepare for launching a large-scale agricultural production campaign, what needs to be done? Broadly, it can be divided into the following three aspects.

    First, it is necessary to address some policy issues related to agricultural production in light of the new situation that has emerged after land reform. This is a prerequisite for launching an agricultural production campaign. These issues are: (1) Confirming land ownership. According to the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and Party rectification work in 1948, "In areas where the feudal system has been fundamentally eliminated, and poor peasants and farm laborers have obtained land that is roughly equivalent to the average amount, even if there are differences in the land owned by them and middle peasants (which is allowed), but the difference is not significant, it should be considered that the land problem has been resolved, and the issue of land reform should not be raised again." In such areas, the land and property rights of all men, women, old, and young people of all classes (including landlords and old-style rich peasants before land reform) should be finally determined on a household basis, and their inviolability should be guaranteed. The highest administrative organs of each liberated area should uniformly issue land licenses, which should be transferred level by level to the counties and municipalities for filling out and issuing to household heads for safekeeping. In the future, in cases of land transfer, sale, family division, marriage, etc., permission should be granted to separate or exchange land licenses. For those who are difficult to reform for the time being, their land licenses may be temporarily kept by certain organizations (such as village governments) upon public discussion, and issued to them after they have transitioned to labor. (The Northeast Administrative Committee's regulations on issuing land licenses, broadcast by this agency on June 12th, can be used as a reference for various localities.) (2) All deviations that have occurred and have not been corrected during the land reform process must be seriously, appropriately, and as quickly as possible corrected. Even if it is a partial or even individual phenomenon, it must be given sufficient attention and should not be treated carelessly. All wrongly classified class components must be publicly corrected in accordance with the two documents published by the Central Committee in 1933 and Comrade Ren Bishi's report on "Several Issues in Land Reform." For land and property confiscated due to wrong classification, those that can be returned should be returned immediately; those that cannot be returned in kind should be compensated by all public and private forces, taking into account both the interests of the wrongly classified households and the emotions and practical difficulties of the emancipated poor peasants and farm laborers. Families of those who were wrongly killed should be given appropriate condolences by the government. Landlords and rich peasants who have not been given or left with a share of land and property should be promptly and appropriately resettled. Efforts should be made to ensure that all rural people can obtain certain living and production materials so that they can maintain their lives and engage in production. If the district and village governments cannot resolve these issues themselves, the highest governments of the liberated areas must stipulate concrete measures to resolve them, such as taking out a certain amount of public grain and public funds, and other methods to solve them. We must see the positive significance of correcting deviations. We should use correcting deviations to educate cadres and the masses, so that they can raise their class consciousness, truly isolate the enemy, and strengthen ourselves; so that they can understand what our Party's correct policies are, what deviations have occurred in implementation, and carry out correct criticism and self-criticism of the deviations, analyze the nature of the errors, the causes of their occurrence, draw out corrective measures, and learn from them. At the same time, pay attention to overcoming some of the undisciplined or anarchic states in our work, and establish a new democratic order and democratic style. Only in this way can we truly eliminate obstacles to production, and thereby enhance the unity between peasants, between the masses and cadres, and facilitate the development of all future work. (3) Explicitly allow the continued existence of wage labor (including hiring long-term workers, short-term workers, etc.). The terms of employment, except for those already stipulated in labor laws, should be freely agreed upon by both employers and employees. In land reform, the exploitation of hired workers by old-style rich peasants was regarded as part of feudal exploitation because it had feudal characteristics, but it was not a fundamental prohibition of wage labor. In fact, most people who hire workers to cultivate land are currently lacking labor in their homes. Such hiring should be encouraged to avoid wasteland and to create difficulties in the lives of some people. (4) In areas where land reform has been completed, tenancy relations under specific conditions are allowed in accordance with the Land Law Outline of China. That is, those who cannot cultivate their own land due to being lonely, widowed, disabled, or due to participating in the revolutionary army and other revolutionary work that deviates from production, or due to entering factories to work and changing to industrial and commercial operations, or those who need to attract investment to reclaim public wasteland owned by the government, should be allowed to lease their land. Before the government unifies regulations on rent amounts, it can be freely agreed upon by both landlord and tenant. (5) Explicitly protect private free lending after the abolition of usury. Interest rates can be freely agreed upon by creditors and debtors before the government unifies regulations. This new debt right, regardless of its class affiliation, is subject to legal recognition. (6) In all areas that have undergone land reform, the standard of agricultural tax (public grain) burden should be adjusted or revised in light of the current land distribution situation, and the wartime service system should be effectively improved so that it is conducive to supporting the war on the one hand, and can encourage peasant production enthusiasm and improve peasant lives on the other. Some liberated areas have announced that all areas where land reform has been completed will abolish the agricultural progressive tax system and replace it with a proportional tax system without progressive rates, and stipulate that it will be levied based on the average annual yield of each piece of land, not based on the actual yield of the year. Any increase in income due to diligence or improved farming operations will not increase the burden, so that people who produce more can benefit more. In cases of crop failure due to famine or other irresistible blows, the government may reduce or exempt taxes at its discretion. It is also stipulated that village funds should be collected and disbursed in a unified manner, the burden in various places should be balanced, all extra collections should be strictly prohibited, and efforts should be made to reduce the people's burden. These measures can be used as a reference for various localities. In the past, because a large amount of land was concentrated in the hands of a few landlords and old-style rich peasants, it was only reasonable to impose a heavier tax rate on their property obtained through feudal and semi-feudal exploitation than on ordinary peasants (progressive taxation, the more land, the heavier the burden), in order to relatively reduce the burden on ordinary peasants. Now that the land has been equally distributed and feudal exploitation no longer exists, if the agricultural progressive tax system is still implemented, it will hinder the people from becoming rich, so it must be abolished and replaced with a new tax system that facilitates people's production. Wartime service should also adapt to changes in the class situation, achieve rational allocation, and economical use. While ensuring the necessary supply for the war, we strive to mobilize corvée as little as possible. We must cherish and appropriately use labor and strictly prohibit rear-area organs from arbitrarily dispatching corvée under the pretext of wartime service, increasing the burden of labor. So that more manpower and animal power can be concentrated on production. In addition, the wartime service system can and must be improved. For example, Shandong has adopted a paid contract system to transport military supplies and wounded soldiers, which can greatly save labor. All these policies should be announced in writing, widely publicized, and implemented to dispel people's concerns and stabilize and encourage their production enthusiasm.

    The second aspect is to improve agricultural production technology on the existing basis. This is a necessary condition for improving agricultural productivity. Local experience has shown that by improving agricultural tools, or improving farming methods, or adopting good varieties, or changing dry land into paddy fields, etc., the yield of the same land often increases by one or even two or three times. In the past, due to the incomplete removal of feudal shackles, peasants had little interest and little possibility to engage in technological improvement. Now there is this interest and this possibility, so it is possible to universally launch a movement to improve agricultural technology on a wider scale. All rural organizations and rural workers should treat leading and organizing this movement as an important and regular task. Effective measures should be taken to protect and increase livestock, and to promote raising sheep and pigs, accumulating fertilizer, and composting manure; measures that are beneficial to the development of agricultural production such as improving agricultural tools, improving farming methods, selecting varieties, preventing and controlling pests, improving soil quality, and building water conservancy projects should be promoted and rewarded; experts or old farmers with specialized knowledge and rich experience in agricultural production should be identified and organized to help the government guide agricultural production; production competitions should be launched, and under the principle of seeking practicality and avoiding empty fame, labor heroes and model figures who have truly contributed to production, have creativity, and have a driving and leading role should be commended, and their experience should be promoted to the masses; the government should issue necessary and possible interest-free or low-interest agricultural loans every year, and improve loan methods, oppose confusing loans with relief, and adopting a simple relief view of average distribution, only issuing and not collecting. The focus should be on lending production materials, not on lending living materials. The distribution should be planned and focused, preventing misappropriation and backlog, and simplifying issuance procedures to ensure that all loans are fully and promptly issued to the hands of the truly working people. There must be borrowing and repayment in order to increase and expand the issuance year by year. Each liberated area must establish an agricultural production loan bureau to specialize in this matter, so that agricultural loans can be effectively handled on an enterprise basis with planning and in the long term. Only by doing these tasks well can increased production become possible. This autumn, all liberated areas, whether or not they have completed land reform, must guide rural people to grow wheat well, and in winter, call on all rural people to accumulate more fertilizer and repair and add agricultural tools to prepare for the major production campaign of 1949. In order to do all this work well, the government's agricultural departments should first do a good job in the manufacture and distribution of production tools, the purchase and breeding of livestock, the planning and implementation of large and small water conservancy projects, and the selection and promotion of superior varieties.

    The third aspect is to organize rural people for cooperation and mutual assistance. Under the conditions of today's China, to develop agricultural production, the first thing is to break the feudal relations of production that bind the productive forces; and after the feudal relations are broken, the only task is to develop agricultural productive forces—the productive forces formed by the combination of laborers and means of production; and in order to develop productive forces, in addition to improving agricultural technology (means of production), the issue of organizing labor plays a decisive role. Chairman Mao made repeated and detailed explanations on the importance of organizing labor, i.e., organizing cooperation and mutual assistance, in his speeches "On Cooperatives" and "Get Organized!" Especially at present, due to the relative dispersion of land, livestock, and agricultural tools after land reform, coupled with the consumption of long-term war and the destruction of the enemy, resulting in insufficient manpower, animal power, and means of production in rural areas, it is even more necessary to guide peasants to organize and develop cooperation and mutual assistance, and promote women's labor, in order to restore and develop agricultural production. However, organizing labor is not a simple task and cannot be rushed. We must make good use of the personal experience of peasants, adopt a gradual promotion and gradual improvement approach through the ideological awareness of peasants. Therefore, we must oppose commandism and formalism, but we cannot abandon leadership and let it drift. Based on past experience and current conditions, organizing cooperation and mutual assistance: First, it must be voluntary. Any production cooperation organization established by any party imposing coercion on anyone will fail, because this will not stimulate labor enthusiasm. Therefore, compulsory participation must be strictly prohibited in all production cooperation and mutual assistance organizations. That is, even for landlords and idlers, we should teach and supervise them to learn to work, and we should not adopt unilateral control measures. Second, it must be equal and mutually beneficial, and exchange at equal value. In some areas, in cooperation and mutual assistance, unilaterally emphasizing the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers, and forcibly forcing landlords, rich peasants, and even some middle peasants to perform unpaid labor or unequal exchange for poor peasants and hired laborers are erroneous behaviors that undermine production and must be strictly corrected. Third, all working people can become the object of organizing cooperation and mutual assistance. Cooperation and mutual assistance between peasants should be encouraged: It is also permissible for former landlords who turn to labor to participate in peasants' cooperation and mutual assistance; organizing mutual assistance between middle peasants and poor peasants is especially important. In some areas, only organizing production mutual assistance for poor peasants and hired laborers alone is not good. Because in this way, not only can the entire rural production movement not be promoted, but many difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers themselves cannot be solved, such as insufficient production experience, and incomplete production tools. In these aspects, poor peasants and hired laborers need to obtain the help of middle peasants. Fourth, the cooperation and mutual assistance organization itself must have leadership, have calculations, and must be democratic and supervised. Fifth, due to the reduction of male labor in the war, organizing women to participate in production is of great importance. In the past, women in the liberated areas have made many contributions and participated in labor in supporting the front, democracy, land reform, and production movements. In the future, they should be more planned and more extensively organized to become one of the main forces in the production movement, and thereby improve their economic and political status.

    Under the conditions of large-scale war, we cannot demand a rapid and large increase in agricultural production in the liberated areas at present. But raising agricultural production in the liberated areas from the current level, or raising it by an inch, is not only absolutely necessary, but also entirely possible. As long as we fully recognize the importance of restoring and developing agricultural production, as long as we have correct and sound leadership, eliminate all obstacles to agricultural production, take various measures conducive to agricultural production, promote technological improvement, and organize cooperation and mutual assistance, the task can be completed. Just like the victory on the military front, like the victory in land reform, we must also make the same efforts to achieve victory on the production front. All revolution, all social reform, its ultimate goal is to develop production. If we have won militarily and in land reform, but cannot continue to win in production, then our revolution and land reform become meaningless, become unreasonable. Therefore, we must continue to achieve victory in production on the completely new basis of military victory and land reform victory, in order to make our revolution and reform a major historical advance. Use the victory of production to consolidate and expand the victory of land reform, to support and guarantee military victory and strive for the nationwide victory of the revolution.

    把解放区的农业生产提高一步
    目前中国人民的革命战争，正处在胜利的紧张的关头，全国各解放区，必须集中一切努力去争取革命战争在全国范围内的胜利。同时，由于革命战争的进攻形势与不断胜利，使各解放区除接敌区与游击区外都获得了相对安定的环境；这种环境，是可以而且必须被利用来恢复和发展解放区的生产的。必须迅速恢复和发展解放区的生产，使解放区的生产能够在现有的水平上迅速提高一步，这是争取革命战争在全国胜利最基本最重要的一项任务。因为只有解放区生产的提高，才能长期地更有力地去支援前线的革命战争；只有解放区生产的提高，才能改善解放区人民的生活，使人民更加团结，使解放区更加巩固，并因此也就能以充分而切实的事实去说服全中国的人民迅速地走上新民主主义的革命道路。
    毛主席说：一切在后方党政机关担负领导工作的干部，他们虽然因为支援前线、土改、整党及征收公粮等工作，是十分繁忙的，但他们必须至少拿一半以上的时间，即一年中六个月以上的时间，去组织与指导生产事业。又说：一切基本解放区的当前最基本的任务，就是要把生产向上提高一寸。毛主席的这些指示，正是我们各解放区后方工作的基本方针。
    毛主席又说：目前在解放区提高生产，必须是工业生产与农业生产并重。这与以前提高生产以农业生产为重心的情况，是有了一些改变的。这是因为解放区日益扩大，人口日益众多，在解放区内部，已经有了很多的小城市和中等城市，并已开始有了大城市，不少近代的工厂、矿山及工业区，已被解放，铁路、公路、河道及火车、汽车、汽船、木船在解放区已经不少，在今后，还将有更多的城市、工厂、铁路、河道被解放。这些，应该是人民在解放战争中最可宝贵的收获。必须很好地利用这些工厂、矿山、铁路、公路、河道及一切机器去为革命战争的胜利与人民生活水平的提高服务。除此以外，在解放区还有广大的手工业及农村与城市的家庭副业生产。这些手工业生产，一部分由于解放区民主政府的提倡与扶助，已有广大的发展，在解放区的经济生活中起了巨大的作用。但另有一些手工业生产，则由于战争与国民党的罪恶封锁，受到了破坏及生产降低，在土地改革中，由于执行政策中的错误，若干地区的手工业生产，也受到一些破坏或暂时的生产降低。恢复与发展解放区广大的手工业生产，亦是极为重要的任务。虽然在解放区的机器生产及手工业生产，都远不如农业生产广大，其数量亦比农业生产小得多，但这些工业生产在解放区整个社会经济结构中所占的必需的地位，却与农业生产是同等重要的。特别因为工业生产的破坏与缩小，工业产品的缺乏与价格的高昂，就更加显出恢复与发展解放区工业生产的重要性和急迫性。因此，除开那些只有农业没有什么工业生产的农村党委，或只有工商业没有什么农业生产的城市及工厂党委，它们应该唯一地或主要地以发展农业生产或工业生产为自己的生产任务而外，其他所有有农业又有工业生产地区的党委，特别是各中央局、区党委等高级党委，都应该以发展工业生产与发展农业生产摆在并重的地位。只有如此，才能使解放区的经济，走上更加健全更加独立的发展道路。
    关于发展解放区工业生产中的各种问题，过去已有将来还有专门的论文来加以讨论。这里只来讨论发展解放区农业生产中的几个问题。
    农业生产是有季节性的。今年春耕已经过去，夏收已经完毕，解放区各地的农业生产，已经或多或少地获得初步的成绩。今后在一般地区的任务是继续夏锄，作好秋收，在接敌区与游击区要作好护粮斗争，而在某些发生严重灾荒的县份，则要抓紧时机，把抗灾救灾当作唯一的中心任务。但是一般地说，各解放区都应当从现在起，特别是利用今年秋冬雨季，对明年的大生产运动，充分完成一切准备工作。因为一切基本解放区的土地改革，已大部彻底完成，其余一部分地区预计今年秋冬雨季亦可能完成。到明年，便可能在全国一切基本解放区内开展一个完全没有封建束缚的、各阶层人民得以在自由平等的条件下比赛生产发富的普遍的生产运动。
    为了提高解放区的农业生产，为了准备开展一个大规模的农业生产运动，要做些什么呢？大体上可分为以下三个方面。
    首先，是要针对土地改革后所产生的新情况，解决一些有关农业生产的政策问题。这是开展农业生产运动的前提条件。这些问题是：（一）确定地权。按照中央关于一九四八年土改与整党工作指示的规定，“凡属封建制度已经根本消灭，贫雇农已经得到大体上相当于平均数的土地，他们与中农所有土地虽有差别（这种差别是允许的），但是相差不多者，即应认为土地问题已经解决，不要再提土地改革问题。”在这样的地区，就应当以户为单位最后确定各阶层（包括土地改革前的地主、旧式富农在内）一切男女老少人口的地权财权，保障其不受侵犯。各解放区最高行政机关应当统一颁发土地执照，依级转由各县、市政府负责填发，交各户主收执，以后遇有土地转移买卖、分家、嫁娶等情形时，准予分领或换取土地执照。二流子一时难望改好者，其土地执照经公议，可由一定组织（如村政府）暂代保存，待其转入劳动后，再行发给。（六月十二日本社转播东北行政委员会关于颁发土地执照的规定，可供各地参考。）（二）凡是在土地改革过程中曾经发生而尚未纠正的偏向，必须认真地、适当地、并尽可能迅速地加以纠正。那怕是部分的甚或个别的现象也好，都必须予以足够的重视，不应马虎过去。一切划错了的阶级成份，必须按照中央公布的一九三三年的两个文件与任弼时同志关于“土地改革中的几个问题”的报告，公开地加以订正。对于因划错成份而没收的土地财物，能退回的应立即退回；不能原物退还的，应当在一面照顾被错门户的利益，一面照顾翻身贫雇农的情绪与实际困难的原则下，尽一切公私力量，设法予以补偿。对于被错杀者的家属，应由政府设法予以适当的抚恤。对于未曾分给或留给一份土地财物的地主、富农，应迅速地予以适当安置。务使一切农村人民都能得到一定的生活与生产资料，使之能维持生活并从事生产。如果区村政府对于这些问题不能自己解决，各解放区的最高政府就必须规定确实办法去解决，如拿出一定数量的公粮公款及其他办法去解决。要看到纠偏的积极意义。应当利用纠偏教育干部与群众，使他们提高阶级觉悟，做到真正孤立敌人，壮大自己；使他们弄清楚什么是我党的正确政策，什么是执行中发生的偏向，并且对偏向开展正确的批评与自我批评，分析错误的性质、产生的原因，得出纠正的办法，并从中吸取经验教训。同时注意克服我们工作中的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态，建立新的民主秩序与民主作风。只有这样，才能真正扫除生产的障碍，并从而增进农民与农民间、群众与干部间的团结，便利今后一切工作的开展。（三）明令允许雇佣劳动（包括请长工、短工等）的继续存在。雇用条件如何，除劳动法令已有规定者外，应由主雇双方自由约定。在土地改革中把旧式富农对雇工的剥削作为封建剥削的一部分，是因为它带有封建性，并不是根本禁止雇佣劳动。事实上目前雇工种地的人大部是家中缺少劳动力，这种雇工是应当提倡的，以免荒芜土地，并造成一部分人的生活困难。（四）土改完成地区，按照中国土地法大纲的规定，允许特定条件下的租佃关系。即凡因孤寡废疾，或因参加革命军队及其他脱离生产的革命工作，或因进入工厂作工及改营工商业等，因而不能耕种自己所分得的土地者，或政府所有公荒须招人投资开垦者，均应允许出租其土地。租额在政府未统一规定前，可由主佃双方自由约定之。（五）明令保护在废除高利贷以后的私人自由借贷，利率在政府未统一规定前得由债主与债户自由议定。此项新的债权，不问其所属阶级如何，一律受到法律的承认。（六）凡经过土地改革地区，应视今天土地分布的状况，调整或改订农业税（公粮）负担的标准，并切实改善战勤制度，使一方面有利于支援战争，另一方面能鼓励农民生产情绪，有利于改善农民的生活。有些解放区已宣布凡土地改革已经完成地区，一律废除农业累进税则，改用无累进率的比例税收制，并规定一律按各块土地常年平均产量计征，不按当年实际产量计征，凡因勤劳或改良作务所增加之收入，一律不增加负担，使人民多生产者能多得利。在因荒年或其他不可抗的打击而致歉收的情形下，则得由政府酌予减征或免征。并规定统一村款收支，平衡各地负担，严禁一切额外征收，力求减轻人民负担。这些办法，可供各地参考。过去，由于土地大量集中在少数地主与旧式富农手里，只有对他们这种依靠封建、半封建剥削得来的财产课以较一般农民为重的税率（累进征收，土地越多的负担越重），才算合理，才能相对地减轻一般农民的负担。现在土地已经平分，封建剥削不再存在，如果仍旧施行农业累进税则，就会妨碍人民的发家致富，因此，必须予以废除，代之以便利人民生产的新的税则。战争勤务，亦当适应阶级情况的变化，做到合理分配，节约使用。在保证战争必需的供应下，求得尽可能少动员差役。要十分爱惜和适当使用民力，严格禁止后方机关假借战勤名义随便支差，加重民力负担。以便使更多的人力畜力集中用于生产。此外，战勤支差制度亦可以而且必须加以改良，例如山东已采用有代价的包运制来运输军用物资和伤兵等，即可大大节省民力。所有这些政策，应予明文公布，广为宣传，贯彻执行，以解除人民的顾虑，安定与鼓励其生产情绪。
    第二个方面，就是要在现有的基础上提高农业生产技术。这是提高农业生产力的必要条件。各地经验证明：由于改良农具，或改良耕作法，或采用好的品种，或变旱地为水地等等，往往使同一土地的产量增加一倍乃至两三倍不等。过去由于封建束缚没有彻底解除，农民很少兴趣也很少可能从事技术改良；现在是有这个兴趣也有这种可能了，因此得以在更广泛的范围内普遍开展改良农业技术的运动。一切农村组织与农村工作者，应将领导与组织这一运动当作重要与经常的任务。应当采取各种有效办法，保护与增殖耕畜，并提倡养羊养猪，积肥沤粪；应当提倡和奖励改良农具，改良耕作法，选择品种，防除虫害，改良土质，兴修水利等等有益于发展农业生产的措施；应当物色并组织一切对农业生产具有专门智能与丰富经验的专家或老农，帮助政府指导农业生产；应当开展生产竞赛，在请求实际不惊虚名的原则下，表扬真正对生产有贡献有创造并有推动带头作用的劳动英雄与模范人物，把他们的经验推广到群众中去；政府每年应当发放必要的和可能的无利或低利农业贷款，并改善贷款方法，反对把贷款混同赈款，采取平均分配，只发不收的单纯救济观点，要以贷给生产资料为主，而不是以贷给生活资料为主，要有计划有重点的分配，防止挪用积压，并简化发放手续，保证全部并及时地发放到真正劳动人民的手里，必须有借有还，以便逐年增加，扩大发放。各解放区必须设立农业生产贷款局，专司其事，以便有计划地，长期地把农贷在企业化基础上切实办好。只有作好这些工作，才能使增产成为可能。在今年秋季，一切解放区，不论已否完成土地改革的地区，均必须指导农村人民种好麦地，在冬季号召一切农村人民多多积肥，修理与添置农具，为一九四九年的大生产运动作好一切准备工作。为了作好这一切工作，政府的农业部门对于生产工具的制造与分配，牲畜的购买繁殖，大小水利的计划与举办，优良品种的选择与推广等，应该首先作好。
    第三个方面，就是要组织农村人民的合作互助。在今天中国的条件下，要发展农业生产，首先是要打破束缚生产力的封建的生产关系；而在封建关系被打破以后，唯一的任务，就是发展农业生产力——由劳动者与生产工具相结合而形成的生产力；而为了发展生产力，除了改良农业技术（生产工具）而外，起决定作用的，就是组织劳动力的问题了。关于组织劳动力，即组织合作互助的重要性，毛主席在“论合作社”、“组织起来”的讲演中，曾作过反复详尽的说明。特别在目前，由于土地改革后，土地、耕畜、农具等相对分散，加上长期战争的消耗与敌人的破坏，造成农村人力、畜力及生产资料之不足，因此更需要引导农民组织起来，发展合作互助，并提倡妇女劳动，才能恢复和发展农业生产。但是组织劳动力，不是一件简单的工作，不能操之过急，必须善用农民的亲身经验，通过农民的思想觉悟，采取逐步推广、逐步提高的方式。因此要反对命令主义和形式主义，但又不能放弃领导，任其自流。根据过去经验和目前状况，组织合作互助：第一，必须是自愿结合的。由任何方面对于任何人实行强制而建立起来的生产合作组织，没有不失败的，因为如果这样就不能发挥劳动积极性。所以在一切生产合作互助组织中必须严禁强迫加入。即是对于地主和二流子，应教导和监督他们学习劳动，也不应采取片面的管制办法。第二、必须是平等互利，等价交换的。某些地区在合作互助中，片面强调贫雇农利益，强制地主、富农甚至一部分中农给贫雇农作无偿劳动或不等价交换，都是破坏生产的错误行为，必须严格纠正。第三、一切劳动人民都可以成为组织合作互助的对象。农民与农民间的合作互助，固应提倡：转向劳动的旧地主参加农民的合作互助，也是允许的；组织中农和贫雇农的互助，尤其重要。某些地区只单独组织贫雇农生产互助，是不好的。因为这样，不但不能推动整个农村的生产运动，也不能解决贫雇农自身的许多困难，如生产经验不足，生产工具不够完备等等。在这些方面，贫雇农都需要取得中农的帮助。第四、合作互助组织本身，必须有领导，有计算，又必须有民主有监督。第五、由于战争中男劳动力的减少，组织妇女参加生产，有极大的重要性。各解放区妇女过去在战争中，在支前、民主、土改与生产运动中已有不少的贡献和参加劳动的经验。今后更应有计划地更广泛地组织她们，成为生产运动中的主力军之一，并从而提高她们的经济地位与政治地位。
    在大规模战争的条件下，我们不能要求目前解放区的农业生产能有飞速和大量的提高。但是将解放区的农业生产从现有的水平上提高一步，或者说提高一寸，不但是完全必要，而且是完全可能的。只要充分认识：恢复与发展农业生产的重要性，只要有正确健全的领导，扫除一切不利于农业生产的障碍，采取各种有利于农业生产的措施，提倡技术改良，组织合作互助，便可完成任务。象军事战线上的胜利一样，象土地改革工作的胜利一样，我们还必须以同样的努力取得生产战线上的胜利。一切革命，一切社会改革，其最后目的，都是为了发展生产，如果我们在军事上胜利了，在土地改革中胜利了，而不能在生产上继续取得胜利，那我们的革命和土地改革就变为无意义的了，变为无理取闹了。所以我们必须在军事胜利与土地改革胜利的完全新的基础上继续取得生产上的胜利，才能使我们的革命和改革成为历史上的重大进步。用生产的胜利，来巩固和扩大土地改革的胜利，来支援和保证军事上的胜利并争取革命在全国范围内的胜利。
