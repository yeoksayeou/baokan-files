　　Stalin's Diplomatic Policy Achieves New Victory
  　Pravda on the Results of the Danube Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] TASS, Moscow, 22nd: Pravda recently published an article entitled "On the Results of the Danube Conference," stating:

    The conference on formulating and adopting a convention on the navigation regime of the Danube River completed its work on August 18. The Danube Conference was conducted in a truly democratic manner, in the spirit of international cooperation, and guaranteed the resolution of the problems it faced in accordance with the interests of the Danube countries. The conference reflected the profound and fundamental changes that have taken place in the lives of the people of Eastern European countries in recent years. There was a time when imperialist countries, primarily Britain and France, held complete dominance over the Danube River. They considered themselves masters of the Danube. At that time, the Danube Commission, which exercised its functions on the basis of inequality and injustice, was a tool for the political and economic domination of the Danube by non-Danube countries. During the Munich period, the long-term rule of the Western imperialists over the Danube logically led to the transfer of control over this waterway to the German fascist invaders. The Danube thus became a "passage" for Hitler's advance to the East.

    Thanks to the Soviet army's defeat of German fascism, the Danube countries gained the opportunity to fully control their destiny. The old order can never be restored in this part of Europe.

    The entire process of the Danube Conference vividly demonstrated the struggle between two diplomatic lines, as pointed out by Molotov as early as the 1946 Paris Peace Conference when discussing the Danube issue. He said: "There are two diametrically opposed methods in international life, one is the age-old method of oppression and domination; the other method, although not yet fully developed, is democratic cooperation based on the principle of recognizing the equality and legitimate interests of all countries, large and small. We have no doubt that, despite all obstacles, the method of democratic cooperation between countries will eventually prevail."

    At this Danube Conference, Western countries had the opportunity to express their respect for the sovereignty of the Danube countries and their goodwill for equal cooperation with the latter through action, but they abandoned this opportunity and stubbornly adhered to their imperialist policies. They forgot that when the rights and interests of free and independent countries are discussed, this policy is doomed to failure. This is why Western countries suffered political and diplomatic failure at the Danube Conference.

    The new Danube Convention, which conforms to the vital interests of the Danube countries, is the first convention to guarantee the true rather than superficial equality of the Danube countries and fully guarantees freedom of navigation. It has nothing in common with the unjust and harsh conditions of 1921, which have no place and cannot have a place in our day. A new page has begun in the history of the Danube.

    The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France declared on the last day of the conference that they refused to sign the new convention. But this last expression of the policy of command and oppression failed. Needless to say, this will not affect the convention coming into force after ratification in accordance with the prescribed procedures. Life will leave behind those who cling to the old and try to hinder progress.

    The victory of the Danube Conference primarily marks a new victory for the Soviet Union's Stalinist foreign policy. The Soviet people fully agree with and welcome the conclusion of this important convention.

### 斯大林外交政策新胜利　真理报论多瑙河会议成果

　　斯大林外交政策新胜利
  　真理报论多瑙河会议成果
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：真理报顷发表专文“论多瑙河会议的成果”称：
    制订并通过多瑙河航运制度公约的会议，已于八月十八日完成其工作。多瑙河会议是在真正民主的情况下进行的，它本着国际合作的精神，并按照多瑙河国家的利益而保证解决它所面临的问题。会议反映了近几年来在东欧各国人民生活中所已发生的那种深刻的根本变化。有一个时期，帝国主义国家，首先是英法，曾在多瑙河上占有完全支配的地位。它们以多瑙河主人自居。那时，在不平等与不公正的基础上行使职务的多瑙河委员会，是非多瑙河国家在政治上与经济上统治多瑙河的工具。在慕尼黑期间，西方帝国主义者对多瑙河的长期统治，终于合乎逻辑地引致这一河道控制权转入德国法西斯侵略者之手。多瑙河就这样成了希特勒东进的一条“通路”。
    由于苏军击溃了德国法西斯，多瑙河各国便获得了完全掌握其命运的机会。旧的秩序永不能在欧洲这一地带恢复了。
    多瑙河会议的全部进程，生动地证明了莫洛托夫早在一九四六年巴黎和会上讨论多瑙河问题时指出的外交上两条路线的斗争。他说：“国际生活上存在有两种针锋相对的方法，一种就是自古闻名的，压迫与支配的方法；另一种方法，诚然还没有充分广泛的发展，却是以承认一切大小国家的平等以及合法利益之原则为基础的民主合作的方法。我们毫不怀疑，尽管有一切阻碍，但各国间民主合作的方法终将胜利。”
    西方国家在这次多瑙河会议中，得到机会以行动来表示它们尊重多瑙河国家主权，以及与后者平等合作的善意，但它们放弃了这个机会，而固执其帝国主义政策。他们忘记了：当讨论到自由与独立国家的人民的权利与利益时，这种政策是注定要失败的，这就是西方国家在多瑙河会议上何以遭到政治与外交上失败的理由。
    新的多瑙河公约，符合于多瑙河国家的切身利益，这一个首次保证多瑙河各国真正的而非表面的平等的公约完全保证航行的自由。它与一九二一年的不公正的苛刻条件毫无相同之处，这种条件在我们的日子里是没有，而且也不能有其容身的余地了。多瑙河的历史已开始了新的一页。
    美英法代表在最后一天会议上宣称：他们拒绝签署新公约。但是最后这一次命令与压迫政策的表示是失败了。不消说，这对公约在按照规定程序于批准后生效一点，绝不发生任何影响，生活是要把那些固执于旧时的一切并图阻挠进步的人抛在后面的。
    多瑙河会议的胜利，首先标志着苏联的斯大林外交政策的新胜利。苏维埃人民完全赞同并欢迎这一重要公约的缔结。
