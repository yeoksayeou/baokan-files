[Jizhong Telegram] This year's harvest of local indigo in Anxin Baiyangdian is very good, and the masses are now actively harvesting. The highest yield per mu is 120-130 jin, and the lowest is also 50-60 jin. The Guolikou area, which has a foundation for indigo cultivation, has a higher yield due to good soil quality and abundant fertilization, generally around 200 jin per mu, and the lowest yield is also 70-80 jin. Zheng Yongxing, a villager in Guolikou, applied 200-300 boatloads of mud (i.e., applying the green mud from the bottom of the Baiyangdian lake to the fields) per mu, yielding 120-130 jin. He planted five mu of indigo and harvested over 700 jin of indigo dye. In the Sandianzhuang and Lizhuang areas within the Baiyangdian lake, only mud is applied, with less fertilization and poorer soil quality, yielding 60-70 jin per mu. This is several times better than growing crops. The burden of growing indigo is the same as that of common crops, resulting in significant profits, and the indigo farmers are in high spirits. To solve the shortage of water vats, three to five households have implemented mutual aid, with each household contributing one or two vats, which are then concentrated to form an indigo dyeing platform. Those with dyeing technology and those without, those with boats and those without, have also implemented mutual aid. The Promotion Cooperative has loaned more than 60,000 jin of ash and some vats to indigo farmers with greater difficulties. The Guolikou village formulated an indigo protection pact at the indigo farmers' congress, proposing to ensure the quality of indigo, not mixing good and bad, and enhancing the reputation of local indigo. To solve the problem of local indigo sales, the County Promotion Cooperative specially established an indigo industry exchange in Duancun, responsible for introducing indigo merchants from various places to purchase and helping indigo farmers to sell their products. The Guolikou village organized a local indigo sales cooperative to sell products in Shijiazhuang, Wurenqiao, and other places.

　　一亩靛十石粮
  　白洋淀土靛收成很好
    【冀中电】安新白洋淀，今年土靛收成甚好，群众现正积极收割。每亩产量最高的为一百二、三十斤，最低者也有五、六十斤。种靛有基础的郭里口一带，因为土质好，施肥多，产量较高，每亩一般在二百斤上下，最低者也产七、八十斤，郭里口村民郑永兴，一亩地枷泥（即将淀低的青泥施到地里）二、三百船，能产一百二、三十斤，他种了五亩靛，光头渣就打了七百多斤。淀内的三田庄、李庄一带，只枷泥，施肥少，土质较次，一船每亩也产六、七十斤。比种庄稼强好几倍。种靛负担和普遍作物一样，因而得利甚多，靛户情绪很高，群众为了解决水瓮的缺乏，三五户实行了互助，每家拿出一、两个瓮，集中起来就是一个打靛台，有打靛技术和无技术的、有船的和无船的，也都实行了互助。推进社则将六万多斤灰和一部分瓮贷给比较困难的靛户。郭里口村在靛民大会上订了护靛公约，提出保证靛的质量，好坏不混合，提高土靛信誉。为解决土靛推销问题，县推进社特在端村成立了保靛业交易所，负责介绍各地靛商购买，帮助靛户推销。郭里口村组织了土靛推销合作社，到石家庄、伍仁桥等地推销。
