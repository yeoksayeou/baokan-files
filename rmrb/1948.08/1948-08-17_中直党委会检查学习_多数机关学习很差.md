　　Central Committee Direct Organs Party Committee Inspects Study
　　Most Organs' Study is Poor
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] The Party Committee directly under the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of eight units directly under it on the tenth of this month to inspect the study situation and degree of the "Four Great Documents." The Propaganda Department also sent people to participate. After six hours of reporting and discussion, the meeting seriously concluded that the progress of this study was very uneven. Although many units have begun to work hard to study, they have not studied the documents carefully, connected them with reality, and transformed their work sufficiently. Only the Yucai Elementary School has begun to find a way. The faculty and staff of Yucai Elementary School spent one and a half hours every morning for a month studying documents such as "Lenin on How Soviet Government Employees Should Work" and "The Current Tasks of the North China Liberated Area." They focused on individual study, combined with collective discussions, and, on the basis of criticism and self-criticism, connected and examined their actual work, and solved problems in a timely manner. They determined that the purpose of the study was to establish a regularized school system and work style. They examined the empirical working methods from top to bottom and from bottom to top. For example, leading cadres had too many meetings: branch meetings, group meetings, study committee meetings, school affairs meetings, and teaching meetings were held eighteen times in a month, plus various temporary meetings, averaging one meeting per day, and each meeting took two or three hours. They were busy with meetings all day, making resolutions, and had no time to check the extent to which the resolutions were implemented. Since this review, unnecessary meetings have been greatly reduced, and leading cadres have begun to go deep into the lower levels to implement resolutions. In the past, the General Affairs Section and the Teaching Section of the school had some inconsistencies in their working relationship. During the study, cadres of the General Affairs Section suggested that the leadership "emphasized teaching and neglected general affairs." After inspection, it was found that the General Affairs Section did not resolutely implement the resolutions. For example, the school affairs meeting decided to cover the rice bowls with gauze for summer hygiene, but the General Affairs Section delayed it for a month on the pretext of waste. It was also found that the above-mentioned incorrect remarks were only the opinions of two or three people, such as the deputy section chief and the instructor. Everyone unanimously criticized the deputy section chief's and others' undisciplined and anarchic phenomenon of not implementing the resolutions. After the study, the past resolutions have now been implemented one by one. In the past, egalitarianism was very common among many comrades in the school. Students with families had more adequate clothing; those without families had difficulty with clothing. During the height of summer this year, the school gave each of these students a shirt, but these teachers and staff believed that if they were to be issued, they should be issued to everyone equally. This kind of egalitarianism was also initially criticized. The above examples show that the study has now begun, and achievements are being created initially. The meeting also criticized some shortcomings existing in the study of various organs, such as unclear study objectives, no focus, all-encompassing, wanting to solve all the problems in the organs at once, and as a result, nothing can be solved. In terms of study methods, there are still remnants of dogmatism and empiricism. For example, the guest house looked for problems in its own organs one by one according to Lenin's documents on the work of organs, instead of examining the work according to the spirit and essence of the documents. In the criticism and self-criticism of a certain office, there was a tendency of non-political criticism, and the study had no focus. At the meeting, comrades from the Propaganda Department and the Party Committee gave instructions on the study of this month: continue to study Lenin's documents on the work of organs and the second chapter of "Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder. First of all, it should be clear that the purpose of the study is to overcome some of the undisciplined and anarchic states in the work of the organs, strengthen discipline and unity, clarify the current situation and tasks, improve the work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of each comrade, and transform the work style of the organs. The study method should be based on the characteristics of each organ, find out the focus of the study, solve the main problems, and first of all, start from the ideological and political level, and oppose blindness and empiricism in the study.

### 中直党委会检查学习　多数机关学习很差

　　中直党委会检查学习
  　多数机关学习很差
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局直属党委于本月十日召集直属机关八个单位开会，检查“四大文件”学习的情况与程度，宣传部亦派人参加。会议经过六小时的汇报与讨论，认真这段学习进度很不平衡，虽有不少单位已开始努力学习，但精研文件，联系实际，改造工作非常不够，只有育才小学学习开始找到了门径。育才小学教职员在一个月中，按每天早晨一小时半的时间，学习“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”与“华北解放区当前任务”等文件，以个人学习为主，结合集体讨论，在批评与自我批评的基础上，联系与检查实际工作，发现问题及时解决。确定学习目的在于建立正规化的学校制度与作风。他们自上而下、自下而上的检查了经验主义的工作方法。如领导干部会议多，支部会、小组会、学委会、校务会、教导会等一个月开了十八次，再加上各种临时会议，平均每天开一次会，一次会又要开两三个钟头。整天忙于开会，做决议，没有时间检查决议执行的程度。自此次检讨后，不必要的会议大大减少，领导干部开始深入下层，贯彻决议。该校总务科与教导科过去工作关系上有些不协调，总务科干部在学习中提出领导上“重教导轻总务”。经过检查，发现总务科执行决议不坚决，如校务会为了夏季卫生，曾决定饭碗要用纱布盖起来，总务科借口浪费，拖了一个月未予执行。也发现了上述那些不正确的发言，只是副科长、指导员等两三个人的意见。大家一致对于副科长等不执行决议的这种无纪律、无政府现象，作了严格的批判。学习后，过去的决议现在都一件一件的实现了，该校不少同志过去平均主义思想很普遍，有家属的学生，衣服较为充足；无家属者衣服困难。今年盛暑时候，学校给这些学生每人发了一件衬衣，这些教职员却认为要发就应一律都发。象这一类的平均主义思想也受到初步的批判。以上例子说明学习现在开始，成绩正初步创造。会议同时也指责了各机关学习中存在着的某些缺点，如学习目的不明确，无重点，包罗万象，想把机关里的问题一下统统解决了，结果什么也解决不了。在学习方法中，也还有教条主义与经验主义的残余，如招待所按列宁论机关工作的文件，一条一条的找自己机关里的毛病，不是根据文件的精神与实质，来检查工作。某室在批评与自我批评中，产生了非政治的批评的倾向，学习没有中心。会上宣传部与党会委的同志对本月份学习提出指示意见：继续学习列宁论机关工作及左派幼稚病第二章两个文件，首先应明确学习目的在于克服机关工作中的某些无纪律无政府状态，加强纪律性与统一性，明确当前形势与任务，提高每个同志的工作积极性与责任心，改造机关工作作风。学习方法应根据各机关的特点，找出学习的重点，解决主要问题，首先要从思想上政治上入手，反对学习中的盲目性与经验主义。
