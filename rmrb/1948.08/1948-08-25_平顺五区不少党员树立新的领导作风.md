【Taihang News】 When the base point villages in the Fifth District of Pingshun summarized their experiences in summer harvesting, weeding, and leadership exchanges, they discovered that many party members had established a new leadership style during this work. Song Xiaoqiu, an old hero (and Party member) from Dongqingbei, first assessed the masses' thoughts when rectifying mutual aid. He discovered that the masses had many opinions about the past mutual aid groups. Some said that mutual aid was an official matter from above, some said that mutual aid was to win glory for the heroes, and some said that mutual aid had too many meetings and that they could sleep earlier without it. After discovering these problems, Song Xiaoqiu personally helped the Song Xiaopang brigade to solve them specifically. He first made a profound self-criticism of the undemocratic leadership style of the past and resolved the legacy issues, which eliminated the masses' resentments. One hundred and thirty households voluntarily re-formed seventeen groups, and after discussion, they developed a production and prosperity plan. Cheng Baoyu, a model Party member from Dongchan Village, personally took charge of a group to create a model, helping and training labor hero Cheng Guoze to develop a plan and solve problems within the group. He used education and praise for skills to transform Cheng Jinshui, a well-known good-for-nothing in the district. When labor hero Wang Huaiquan led mutual aid, he fully promoted democracy and rationally used various labor forces. The group had eight male full laborers, four female full laborers, two half laborers, and one old man. During weeding and wheat harvesting, specific tasks were assigned: women pulled seedlings, and men harvested wheat. Originally, 126 workdays were estimated, but due to the scientific use of labor, 32 workdays were saved, making it better and faster than in previous years. In the past, only a scattered few women in the Fifth District participated in agricultural labor in an organized way, but this year, under the leadership of female Party members and heroes, a large number of women poured into the agricultural production front, expanding the rural labor force. Female Party member Cheng Zhaocai put forward a powerful slogan to mobilize women: "One woman's strength is not enough, but two women are as good as a man," and "Go to the fields at dawn, and people will not get hot and save labor." She personally led a women's brigade to pull seedlings and harvest wheat, which promoted women's participation in the fields throughout the village. Qi Hua personally led and organized 229 women in the whole village to harvest more than 322 mu of wheat and pull seedlings on 219.4 mu, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor when summer harvesting and weeding were squeezed together.

    【太行讯】平顺五区基点村在总结夏收、锄苗、交流领导经验时，发现不少党员在这段工作中树立了新的领导作风。东青北老英雄宋小秋（党员）在整顿互助时，首先摸群众思想，发现群众对过去互助组有不少意见，有的说互助是上级的公事，有的说互助是为了给英雄争光，有的说互助开会多，不互助能早睡。发现这些问题后，宋小秋便亲自帮助宋小胖大队具体解决，自己先深刻的检讨了过去领导作风的不民主，并解决了遗留问题，群众的思想闷气消除了。一百三十户重新自愿结合了十七个小组，经过讨论并订出生产发家计划。东禅村模范党员程保玉亲自掌握一组创造典型，帮助与培养劳英程郭则订计划，解决组内问题；他运用教育与表扬一技之长的办法，改造了全区有名的二流子程金水。劳英王怀圈领导互助时充分发扬了民主，合理使用各种劳力，该组八个男全劳力，四个女全劳力，二个半劳力，一个老汉，在锄苗割麦时具体分工，女人拔苗男人割麦，原计需工一百二十六个，由于使用得很科学，结果省工三十二个，比往年又好又快。以往五区妇女有组织的参加农业劳动只是零散与极少数的，但今年在女党员与英雄们的带头领导下，大批妇女涌上农业生产战线，扩大了农村劳力面。女党员程招财提出发动妇女的有力口号：“一个妇女力不沾，两个妇女足顶汉”，“上地起五更，人不受热又省工”。并亲自率领一个妇女大队拔苗割麦，推动了全村妇女上地；齐花则亲自带领与组织全村二百二十九个妇女割麦三百二十二亩多，拔苗二百一十九亩四，克服了夏收锄苗挤在一块劳力不足的困难。
