[Report from our newspaper's general branch reporters]: After the Taihang District Party Committee's May meeting clearly stipulated the working guidelines of "correcting policies, restoring and developing production, completing party rectification and political construction, and supporting the front lines," each county, in order to accept these guidelines, conducted a general survey and study and a correct assessment of the working foundation (basic situation of old and semi-old areas) from the second half of May to the first half of July. This kind of assessment has historical significance for the entire Taihang area. Taihang is one of the oldest liberated areas in North China. After the rent reduction and interest rate reduction and reasonable burden during the Anti-Japanese War and the anti-traitor liquidation in the winter of 1945 (after Japan's surrender), most of the landlords' land had been returned to the peasants. In Jixi counties of the First Sub-district, the landlords' land decreased by more than 50%; in Jindong counties of the Second Sub-district, it decreased by about 70%. The situation in other areas was roughly the same. The land reform movement in the autumn and winter seasons after the May 4th Directive in 1946 formally put forward the slogan of "thoroughly eliminating feudalism and implementing leveling and compensation." Most areas finally resolved the land problem in this movement and further investigated their floating wealth and land assets. According to statistics from 243 villages in Wu'an, the landlords originally had 300,000 mu of land, and 200,000 mu were claimed back by the peasants during the anti-traitor liquidation. In the August and winter movements of 1946, another 70,000 mu of land were claimed back. (Landlords eventually had only 147 mu left). According to statistics from 15 villages in 8 counties, including Xingtai and Zanhuang, in the First Sub-district, the landlords originally had 1,800 mu of land. Before the land reform, the peasants claimed back 1,020 mu, and in the August land reform, another 633 mu were claimed back (landlords eventually had only 147 mu left).

	Failure to Grasp the Real Situation Led to Underestimation of Land Reform Achievements

	As a result of implementing leveling and compensation with the landlords' land that was finally claimed back, each peasant in each county obtained an average of two or three mu of land (in villages with less land) to five or six mu of land (in villages with more land). The amount of land left to the landlords was, on average, less than half that of the peasants. Statistics from 205 villages in Lucheng County (which can generally represent the situation in ordinary counties) show that there were originally 616 landlord households, with an average of 14.75 mu of land per person; 764 managing landlord households, with an average of 11.22 mu per person; 1,537 rich peasant households, with an average of 10.49 mu per person; 1,769 well-to-do middle peasant households, with an average of 7.6 mu per person; 10,632 middle peasant households, with an average of 5.1 mu per person; 11,465 poor peasant households, with an average of 3.1 mu per person; and 2,349 extremely poor households, with an average of 0.78 mu per person. After leveling and compensation, by the spring of 1947, still using the original number of households for statistics, the landlords had an average of 1.75 mu of land per person, and 207 households became extremely poor; the managing landlords had an average of 2.1 mu per person, which was one-third less land than the previous poor peasants; the rich peasants had 5 mu per person, the well-to-do middle peasants had 5.6 mu, the middle peasants had 5.5 mu, the poor peasants had 5.86 mu, and the extremely poor had 5.55 mu. According to the provisions of the Land Law Outline, feudalism had been completely eliminated. Due to the liquidation of enemy and puppet personnel for political issues, 565 well-to-do middle peasant households were downgraded to middle peasants, and 332 middle peasant households were downgraded to poor peasants. That is to say, the middle peasants had been harmed.

	However, the leadership in various places failed to grasp this basic situation in a timely manner, and under the domination of the idea of absolute egalitarianism, they emphasized that the elimination of feudalism was not thorough enough, and that the peasants' emancipation was far from sufficient. They demanded continued pursuit of the "feudalism" that no longer existed, digging "air-raid shelters," and pursuing "metamorphosed landlords." Errors began from here, and some counties even launched large-scale movements in the autumn, resulting in the expansion of the scope of struggle in many villages to about 15% to 20% of the total number of households, with a few villages reaching 30%, seriously damaging the interests of the middle peasants. Social order and mass thinking became chaotic, and production enthusiasm was affected. Last winter, there was also a blind emphasis on thorough division and a one-sided poor-peasant viewpoint. In some "poor peasant leagues" in Shahe and other counties, a large number of middle peasants' doors were sealed, and in Yuanshi and other counties, some poor peasants forcibly used the livestock and carts of the middle peasants and forcibly borrowed the land and grain of the middle peasants. Some members of the "poor peasant leagues" in Pingshun and other counties even extorted money and goods from the middle peasants, increasing the burden on the middle peasants and making social order even more chaotic, affecting the production enthusiasm of all classes. Zhong Nong Dong, a middle peasant in Yuquan Village, Lingchuan County, once said: "I only hate that there are too many things in my house, and I just want to finish eating them all at once. I used to pick up manure when I saw it, but now I don't pick it up anymore." Jin Laixi said: "I worry about the cattle dying every day." The Yang Shiyong family, a middle peasant family of three in Mao Village, Shahe, borrowed an excuse to eat a pig weighing eighty jin during the New Year. The Yang Xichun family spent 22,000 yuan on buying oil, vinegar, flour, and vegetables in four months. Many households secretly took grain to exchange for meat. In the Jiuyu area of Wu'an, farmers with labor power were unwilling to plant more land, and craftsmen dared not do more work. They were all willing to downgrade themselves to poor peasants or maintain their poor peasant status. The richer middle peasants felt that they could not escape being struggled against sooner or later, so they adopted the attitude of "eating in the stomach is pure profit" and squandered and wasted, "just not starving to death." During the same period, due to the lack of investigation and understanding of the old rural branches in various places, they also blindly emphasized impurity within the Party, and in several experimental villages, they adopted the leftist and adventurous practice of kicking away the old organizations with one foot, causing chaos in the rural Party. Many Party members and cadres passively went on strike, waiting to be struggled against and stepping down. The results of party rectification in the experimental villages in various places finally proved that the phenomenon of landlords and rich peasants controlling the branches was extremely rare. The main problem was impurity in ideology and work style. Licheng, Lucheng and other counties once believed last winter that 40% of the rural branches were manipulated by landlord and rich peasant Party members, but the results of the investigation in the experimental villages showed that there were no Party members with landlord and rich peasant status at all, which was obviously a false report.

	Resolutely Correct Leftist Errors, All Classes Unite to Become Prosperous

	After January and February of this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and the District Party Committee, various localities resolutely corrected leftist errors, rectified the Party's policies, and reversed this chaotic situation. The wrongly struggled middle peasants were reclassified, their control was cancelled, their special agent hats were removed, and their power (returning existing items), and the District Party Committee issued a letter to peasant Party members and village cadres, clearly pointing out that the Taihang land problem had been resolved, calling on all classes to unite and produce. In this way, everyone felt that their lives and property were guaranteed and actively resumed production. The rich peasants and landlords were partially resettled. If they could become a member of the community in three or five years, they also felt that there was hope and began to work hard to participate in labor. After distinguishing between right and wrong, merit and demerit, the Party members understood that party rectification was to cure diseases and save people, and many had decided to perform meritorious service in production to offset their demerits. They began to actively participate in and lead production. This spring, Xiaoxi Village, Neiqiu, added 47 head of livestock and reclaimed 98 mu of wasteland. In 25 days, 18 villages in the Third District of Shexian accumulated 66,000 loads of fertilizer. Seventeen villages in Pingshun reclaimed more than 800 mu of raw and cooked wasteland. This year, 20 young people from Zhisi Village, Gaoyi, joined the army and went out, but they even planted more than 3 qing of good land that had been abandoned last year. Sorghum was only hoeed once last year. This year, it has been hoeed three times, and the masses plan to hoe it again after the next rain. Li Fuhei, a farmer in Xichuan Village, Huguan, applied 350 loads of fertilizer to his four mu of corn, and Ma Jinwang applied manure three times to his one mu of Jin Huanghou corn, applying 50 loads of fertilizer just for topdressing. The village planted a total of 41 mu of Jin Huanghou, applying more than 2,700 loads of fertilizer for topdressing. Many farmers regretted that they should not have squandered and wasted in the past, and those who had put down their manure baskets began to pick up manure again. They said: "Those who were wrongly struggled will be compensated, and there will be no more struggles in the future." "Live a good life, what you get is your own!" "Chairman Mao's policies have come to our village."

	However, a few cadres were not fully aware of correcting policies and correcting leftist deviations. Some district cadres in Linxian said: "The policy has changed too fast and too violently, and we can't keep up." Some district cadres in Xiyang and other counties went to the villages and dared not correct the deviations when they saw them, and dared not deal with the problems, fearing that the policy would change again in the future. That is to say, these comrades do not understand the harm of past mistakes and the necessity of correcting deviations, so they will not do well. In May, the District Party Committee convened a meeting of the prefectural committees, carefully studied the instructions of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau on examining and correcting leftist adventurism, made a historical review of the land reform in the entire district, and clarified the policy of correcting policies, restoring and developing production, completing party rectification and political construction, and supporting the front lines. After that, each county made a serious assessment of the working foundation based on actual materials, and unanimously came to the accurate and realistic conclusion: feudalism has been completely eliminated, land has been basically divided equally, and land reform has not only been completed, but has been thorough. Even if there are still some uneven distribution phenomena, it is a problem of adjustment within a very small range of the peasants, rather than a problem of equal division. Therefore, the general direction in the future is to unite all classes to carry out a large-scale production movement, restore and develop production. In order to clear the obstacles on the road to production, we should appropriately compensate the wrongly struggled middle peasants and resettle the landlords and rich peasants, so that all labor force can be brought into play. In terms of party rectification, the main thing is to transform the issue of work style. This understanding has penetrated into the minds of every leading cadre and Party member, greatly clarifying everyone's minds and greatly improving their consciousness in grasping the Party's line and policies and implementing the correction of leftism and leading production.

　　经过详细调查得出准确结论
  　太行土改已彻底完成
    今后总方向是迅速恢复与发展生产
    【本报讯】总分社记者综合报导：太行区党委五月会议明确规定“端正政策，恢复与发展生产，完成整党建政与支援前线”的工作方针后，各县为接受这一方针，从五月下半月至七月上半月，普遍进行了关于工作基础（老区、半老区基本情况）的调查研究与正确估计。这种估计对太行全区说，是有历史意义的。太行是华北最老的解放区之一，经过抗日时期的减租减息与合理负担及一九四五年冬季（日本投降后）的反奸清算，大部地主土地已归还农民。一分区冀西各县地主土地减少百分之五十以上；二分区晋东各县减少百分之七十左右。其他地区亦大抵如此。一九四六年五四指示以后的秋冬两段土改运动，正式提出了“彻底消灭封建，实行填平补齐”的口号，大部地区在这次运动中把土地问题最后解决了，且进一步清查了其浮财与地财。武安二百四十三村统计，地主原有地三十万亩，在反奸清算中被农民算回的达二十万亩。一九四六年八月与冬季两段运动又算得土地七万亩。一分区邢台、赞皇等八个县十五村统计，地主原有地一千八百亩，土改前被农民算回一千零二十亩，八月土改又算得六百三十三亩（地主最后剩一百四十七亩）。
    没有掌握真实情况过低估计土改成绩
    以最后算回来的地主土地实行填平补齐的结果，各县农民每人均获得土地两三亩（地少村）到五六亩（地多村）。地主所剩土地，数量上每人平均不及农民之半。潞城县二百零五村统计（大体可以代表一般县份情况）：原有地主六一六户，每人平均土地一四点七五亩；经营地主七六四户，每人一一点二二亩；富农一五三七户，每人一○点四九亩；富裕中农一七六九户，每人七点六亩；中农一○六三二户，每人五点一亩；贫农一一四六五户，每人三点一亩；赤贫二三四九户，每人○点七八亩。填补后，到一九四七年春，仍以原户数统计，地主每人平均土地一点七五亩，有二○七户变为赤贫；经营地主每人二点一亩，较以前的贫农土地还少三分之一；富农每人五亩，富裕中农五点六亩，中农五点五亩，贫农五点八六亩，赤贫五点五五亩。以土地法大纲的规定为标准，封建已经彻底消灭。因清算敌伪人员政治问题，富裕中农有五六五户降为中农，中农有三三二户降为贫农。就是说，中农已受到伤害。
    但各地领导上未能及时掌握这个基本情况，与绝对平均观点的支配，强调消灭封建还不彻底，农民翻身还差得很多，要求继续追击已经不存在了的“封建”，挖“防空洞”、追“化形地主”，错误从此开始，若干县并在秋季展开大规模运动，结果是许多村庄扩大斗争面到总户数百分之十五至廿左右，少数村达到百分之卅，严重的伤害了中农利益。社会秩序与群众思想发生混乱，生产情绪受到影响。去冬又有盲目强调彻底平分和片面的贫雇观点。沙河等县有些“贫农团”封了大批中农的门，元氏等县有些贫农强用中农牲口大车，强借中农土地粮食，平顺等县“贫农团”中某些分子甚至敲诈中农财物，加重中农负担，使社会秩序更加混乱，影响了各阶层的生产情绪。陵川县玉泉村中农冬曾说：“我只嫌家里东西多，光想一下吃完。以前见粪就拾，现在也不拾啦。”靳来喜说：“我每天愁的牛不死”。沙河毛村中农杨士永家三口人，借口过年吃了八十斤的一个猪。杨喜春家四个月光买油醋粉菜花了二万二千元。许多户偷拿粮食换肉吃。武安九区一带，农民有劳力不肯多种地，工匠不敢多做工，都愿意自己降成贫农或保持贫农成份，较富裕的中农觉得自己迟早逃不了挨斗争，便抱着“吃在肚里是净赚”的态度，挥霍浪费，“饿不死就行”。同一时期，各地由于对农村老支部缺乏调查了解，也盲目地强调了党内不纯，在若干实验村并采取了一脚踢开老组织的左倾冒险做法，引起农村党的混乱，许多党员与干部消极怠工，等待挨斗，下台，各地实验村整党结果，最后证明地富掌握支部的现象是极个别的。主要问题是思想与作风不纯。黎城、潞城等县去冬曾认为农村支部有百分之四十被地主富农党员操纵，但实验村调查的结果，根本就没有地主富农成份的党员，显然是一种假报告。
    坚决纠正左倾错误各阶层团结闹发家
    今年一、二月后，各地依照晋冀鲁豫中央局与区党委指示，坚决纠正左倾错误，端正党的政策，挽回了这种混乱的局面。错斗了的中农经过改订成份、取消管制、摘特务帽、摘当权的（原物存在的退还），区党委发了告农民党员及村干部书，明确指出太行土地问题已经解决，号召各阶层团结生产，这样大家都觉得自己生命财产有了保障，重新积极生产；富农地主得到部分安置，如有三、五年都能变成份，也觉得有了希望，开始努力参加劳动。党员们经过辨别是非功过，明白了整党是治病救人，有许多已决心在生产中立功抵过。开始积极参加与领导生产。内邱小西村今春新增牲口四十七头，开荒九十八亩；涉县三区十八村二十五天内积肥六万六千驮。平顺十七村开生熟荒地八百多亩。高邑治丝庄今年参军外出二十个青年，但竟将去年荒了的三顷多好地都种上了。高粱去年只锄了一遍。今年已锄过三遍，群众并计划以后下一场雨就锄一遍地。壶关西川村农民李富黑四亩土玉茭上追肥三百五十担，马金旺一亩金皇后玉茭连着上粪三次，光追肥就上了五十担。该村共种四十一亩金皇后，上追肥二千七百多担。许多农民后悔过去不该挥霍浪费，放下粪筐的重新开始拾粪。他们说：“斗错了的还补偿，今后是真不再斗争了。”“好好受吧，受下是自己的！”“毛主席的政策来到咱村了。”
    但有少数干部对端正政策与纠正左偏并不是完全自觉的。林县有些区干部说：“政策转得太快了，太猛了，咱赶不上。”昔阳等县有些区干到村，见偏不敢纠，有问题不敢处理，怕将来政策再变。这就是说，这些同志对过去错误的危害与目前纠偏的必要，还不了解，所以也不会做得很好。五月区党委召开地委会议，仔细研究了晋冀鲁豫中央局检查纠正左倾冒险主义的指示，对全区土改作了历史性的检讨，明确了端正政策，恢复与发展生产，完成整党建政与支援前线的方针。之后，各县根据实际材料，对工作基础也先后做了认真估计，一致得出实事求是的准确结论：封建已彻底消灭，土地已大体平分，土改不但已经完成，而是透底了。即使还有些分配不均现象，也是农民内部很小范围调剂的问题，而不是平分问题。所以今后总的方向是团结各阶层开展大生产运动，恢复与发展生产。为扫清生产道路上的障碍，就应该适当的补偿错斗中农与安置地主富农，使所有劳动力都能发挥。整党方面，则主要的是改造作风问题，这个认识深入到每个领导干部与党员的思想中去，使大家头脑大大清醒，在掌握党的路线政策与执行纠左、领导生产上大大提高了自觉性。
