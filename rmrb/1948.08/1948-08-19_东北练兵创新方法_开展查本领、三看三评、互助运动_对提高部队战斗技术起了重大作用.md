Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army has gained many new experiences in the summer training movement and created some new training methods that have significantly improved the combat skills of the troops, greatly accelerating the progress of the training movement. A brief introduction is as follows:

　　(1) Skill Assessments: At the beginning of the training, some cadres and soldiers were eager to fight the enemy, avenge their comrades, and establish meritorious service; some units, with two-thirds of the soldiers believing they already had sufficient combat experience, became complacent, resulting in low morale for training. In response to this mindset, the leadership proposed the method of "Skill Assessments," calling on everyone to examine their tactical and technical level, and to conduct practical tests using testing methods. For example, in a certain detachment, 60 percent of the soldiers in one company wanted to fight and did not want to train. The leadership randomly selected a squad from the company and posed several questions for testing. As a result, no one answered them completely, which effectively criticized some complacency. After the "Skill Assessments" and the enlightening education of activists, the soldiers felt that they really needed to further improve themselves. Therefore, they made plans, built fortifications, and conducted exercises, transforming the rising eagerness for battle into a widespread and intense training movement.

　　(2) "Three Looks, Three Evaluations": In the past, the comments on training exercises in a certain unit were generally based on ground evaluations or post-exercise evaluations. The former evaluated step by step, which easily affected actions and hindered everyone's freedom to act, and the understanding of the situation was not comprehensive enough; the latter was a post-event commentary, which made it difficult to grasp the specific situation and actions at the time of the exercise. Therefore, the unit created a new learning method of "Three Looks, Three Evaluations" to overcome the shortcomings of the previous two types of evaluations.

　　"Three Looks" are: (1) "Looking from Behind": That is, one combat team conducts the exercise, and another team follows in order, paying attention to the exercising personnel's use of terrain and features, as well as their every action. (2) "Looking from the Front": That is, one team is at the end point of the movement, acting as a hypothetical enemy, and observing the actions of the exercisers. (3) "Looking Back": That is, when the exercise reaches its destination, the three teams go back together, observing and commenting along the way. If there are different opinions in the comments, an exercise is organized on the spot to ensure that it meets the tactical requirements. "Three Evaluations" are: (1) "Comparative Evaluation": That is, after the groups in a squad take turns exercising, a comparative evaluation is conducted on the spot. (2) "Typical Evaluation": That is, a good typical group found in the "Comparative Evaluation" conducts a demonstration exercise, and then everyone makes a general comment on the group, which is summarized by the leading cadres and summarized into tactical principles. (3) "Repeated Evaluation": That is, different squads or groups take turns exercising, and everyone repeatedly comments. In this way, after a review is made to summarize everyone's opinions, another exercise is conducted, which can absorb the advantages of each group and discover new problems at any time. At the same time, these evaluation methods are also mutually combined and flexibly applied. For example, if there is no prominent example at the beginning, repeated exercises and evaluations can be carried out to gradually improve.

　　After this method appeared, it was immediately valued by everyone and universally adopted by various units. This learning method is still gradually developing and enriching its content. For example, in an exercise, a certain company adopted the method of "changing commanders," in which each member of the team took turns serving as the team leader. This allows each soldier to learn command ability, understand the team leader's intentions, and automatically act as an agent when the team leader is injured or killed.

　　However, in the process of training, some troops found shortcomings in the mechanical application of the "lecture, demonstration, evaluation" method, turning "evaluation" into formalism, that is, regardless of the company, platoon, squad, or group, it must be evaluated every time, forming less time for exercises and more time for comments; few people doing, and many people watching. After discovering this shortcoming, the leadership convened cadres to discuss and proposed: It is necessary to master the principle of saying less and doing more. Each subject can be practiced several times before making a general evaluation. The familiar places can be done less, and the unfamiliar places can be done repeatedly. The evaluation should be led, and the spirit of the evaluation lies in drawing experience, not necessarily evaluating every action.

　　(3) Mutual Assistance Campaign: Before this training, some soldiers in a certain unit could not keep up with the progress of education during formal lessons, resulting in the phenomenon of "half-baked" training. This time, a comprehensive mutual assistance campaign was launched to overcome this shortcoming. In the process, each company first formed mutual assistance groups according to technical level, awareness, etc. Those with technology not only have the responsibility to actively help others, but also have the right to urge others to learn; those who are not skilled enough not only have the responsibility to learn from others, but also have the right to ask others for help. Only after they teach each other and learn from each other can they complete the mutual assistance plan. After the unit adopted this education method, five typical mutual assistance groups such as Wang Zuoqing, Fan Yongjiang, and Chen Dajun appeared in the company. For example, Wang Zuoqing's mutual assistance group in the Eighth Company of a certain unit was once called the "three incompletes" group: group leader Wang Zuoqing couldn't open his eyes because of illness, and two group members, Zhao Liancai and Zheng Dexiang, were a cripple who sprained his foot during training, and one was relatively slow-witted. They knew nothing about blasting. But they planned to learn the whole set of blasting techniques within a week. They gave full play to the method of mutual assistance: the group leader couldn't see, so he listened with his ears and desperately remembered other people's experiences; Zhao Liancai was inconvenient with his legs, so he carefully watched other people's movements, and the two of them went back to study each other and taught Zheng Dexiang who worked hard and studied hard. Whenever they had time, they practiced in front of and behind the house, in fortifications and corners, moving stones as explosives, practicing while studying. They checked after each day's study, and if they didn't know or were not skilled, they would learn and teach again until they thoroughly learned it. In this way, this "three incompletes" group finally completed their plan and became a model for the whole battalion to learn from. After such a mutual assistance campaign, the combat skills of the unit have been generally improved, creating a vigorous atmosphere of hard training, solidarity, and progress in the company.

　　东北练兵创新方法
    开展查本领、三看三评、互助运动
    对提高部队战斗技术起了重大作用
    【新华社东北十七日电】东北解放军在夏季大练兵运动中，获得不少新的经验，并创造了一些新的练兵方法，对提高部队战斗技术起了重大作用，大大加速了练兵运动的进程。现简要介绍如下：
    （一）查本领：在练兵开始时，有些干部战士都急于求战杀敌，复仇立功；有些部队三分之二的战士，认为自己已有足够作战经验，发生自满，因而练兵情绪不高。针对这种思想情况，该部领导机关提出了“查本领”的办法，号召大家检讨本身的战术与技术水平，并用测验的方法进行实际的考验。如某支队一连百分之六十的战士都要求打仗，不想练兵。领导机关便在该连中抽了一个班出了几个题目进行测验，结果，没有一个答得完全的，于是有力的批评了某些自满情绪。该部经过了“查本领”和积极分子的启发教育，战士们都感到确实须要进一步提高自己才行，因此纷纷订计划，修筑工事进行演习，由高涨的求战情绪，转入普遍紧张的大练兵运动。
    （二）“三看三评”：某部过去对练兵演习的评论，一般是运用地评或演后评。前者是演一步评一步，容易影响动作，妨碍每个人的自由发挥，了解情况也不够全面；后者是事后评论，对演习当时的具体情况和动作难于掌握。该部乃创造了“三看三评”的新学习方法，克服了前两种演评中所产生的缺点。
    “三看”是：（１）“腚后看”，即以一个战斗小组进行演习，一个组依次跟进，从后面注意演习者对地形地物的利用，以及其每一个动作。（２）“对面看”，即以一个组在运动的终点，一面作假设敌，一面观察演习者的动作。（３）“回头看”，即当演习到目的地以后，三个组一同回去，沿途进行观察和评论，评论中如有不同意见，再就地组织演习，务使合乎战术要求。“三评”是（１）“对比评”，即一个班的各小组轮流演习之后，在现地进行对比评论。（２）“典型评”，即以“对比评”中发现的好的典型小组，进行示范演习，然后大家再对该组进行普遍评论，由领导干部归纳起来，提到战术原则上作出总结。（３）“反复评”，即由不同的班或小组挨次演习，大家反复评论。这样，经过一次评论以后归纳了大家的意见，又进行演习，就能吸收各组的长处，和随时发现新的问题。同时，这几种评论的方法，也是互相结合机励运用的，如最初没有较突出的典型时，就可以先反复进行演习和评论，来逐步加以提高。
    这一方法出现后，立即为大家所重视，并被各单位普遍采用，这个学习方式，目前仍在逐步的发展和丰富其内容。如某连在演习中，采用了“换指挥”的办法，由每个组员轮流担任小组长，这样可使每个战士学习指挥能力，了解组长意图，组长伤亡时，组员可自动代理。
    但在练兵进程中，某些部队发现有机械运用“讲、演、评”方式的缺点，把“评”变为形式主义，即不论连、排、班、组，每做一次都要评一次，形成演习的时间少，评论的时间多；做的人少，看的人多。有的一个排演习两小时，每个战士只轮到一次或两次，大部时间是看别人做。领导机关发现这一缺点后，即召集干部研讨，提出：要掌握少说多做的原则，每个课目可练几遍后作一次总评，熟练的地方可以少做，不熟练的地方可以反复做。评时要有领导，评的精神在于得出经验，不一定每个动作都评。
    （三）互助运动：某部在此次练兵前，部分战士在正式操课期间，赶不上教育进度，造成了练兵中的“夹生”现象。这次就展开了全面互助运动来克服这种缺点。在进行中各连队先将各个战斗小组，按照技术水平、觉悟程度等编成互助小组，有技术的不仅有责任去积极帮助别人，而且有权利督促别人学习，技术不够的，不仅有责任向旁人学习，而且有权利要求别人帮助。彼此教会学会之后，才算完成互助计划。该部采用这个教育方式后，连队中出现了王作清、范永江、陈大俊等五个典型的互助组。如某部八连王作清互助组，曾被称为“三不全”组：组长王作清两眼害病睁不开，两个组员赵连才和郑德祥，一个是练兵摔肿了脚的跛子，一个脑筋比较迟钝，他们对爆破都是一窍不通。但他们却计划要在一周内学会爆炸的整套技术。他们充分发挥了互助的方法：组长看不见就用耳朵听，死命记住人家的经验；赵连才两腿不方便，他就仔细的去看人家的动作，两人回来便互相研究，教给苦练苦学的郑德祥。三个人有空就在屋前屋后工事和墙角演习，搬石头当炸药，边演习边研究。每天学完就检查，如有不会或不熟练，就再学再教，一直到彻底学会为止。这样，这个“三不全”的小组，终于完成了他们的计划，并成为全营学习的模范。该部经过这样的互助运动，战斗技术普遍提高，造成连队里一种猛练苦练团结进步的朝气。
