Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 20th: General Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, recently spoke at the closing of the Northwest Front Committee's enlarged meeting. In addition to briefly recounting the great victories of the Northwest Liberation Army in the spring offensive and its experiences and lessons, he focused on criticizing the anarchistic ideas of petty-bourgeois individualism, pointing out the main methods of combating bureaucracy, and analyzing why our army is an invincible army. He said: The petty bourgeoisie does not belong to the proletariat but to the bourgeoisie. Without strict transformation, there is a significant distance from wholeheartedly serving the people and obeying communism. The considerable number of petty-bourgeois elements within our party is worth noting. What is particularly prominent in the petty bourgeoisie is the anarchistic idea of individualism. They are unwilling to be bound by organization, waver at critical junctures, and when considering issues in action, they often start from taking care of their personal gains and losses, and taking care of their small groups. Taking care of the overall situation is natural only when it does not harm their personal interests and the interests of their small groups; otherwise, it is unnatural, reluctant, or even antagonistic. This weakness is especially prone to surface naturally in serious moments, to the point of violating discipline and disregarding the interests of the revolution. To overcome these phenomena, it is necessary to raise their level of awareness, destroy their petty-bourgeois ideology, and learn from the working people's uprightness, resolute courage, and spirit of self-sacrifice. For example, Comrade Yang Shide, a squad leader of a certain unit, had his eyebrows and hair burned off, his face blackened, and was seriously injured by an enemy incendiary bomb in a battle. The company commander, instructor, and soldiers in his squad urged him to leave the front line, but Comrade Yang considered that the enemy was launching a counter-attack and there was no one to command the squad, so he resolutely refused to leave. Some comrades, in order to complete the blasting mission, strapped explosives to themselves and climbed to the enemy's bunker, shattering themselves and the enemy bunker at the same time. Such heroic deeds have happened not just once, but countless times; not through forced orders, but completely out of voluntary and conscious behavior. These combat heroes sacrificed themselves for the people's cause. This glorious and great spirit of self-sacrifice is truly a model for all ages and forever worthy of our learning. Their high level of political consciousness and heroic struggle are completely different from the petty calculations and small group considerations of the petty bourgeoisie. Regarding the main methods of opposing bureaucracy, he pointed out that it is necessary to follow the mass line, develop criticism and self-criticism, work deeply at the grassroots level, deeply into the companies, reflect the opinions of the masses, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, summarize new experiences among the masses, and implement and popularize them. In daily work, accuracy is required, and procrastination under false pretenses is opposed. Using excuses like "don't be impatient" and waiting for so-called "consideration" to shirk responsibility is all bureaucracy. This has nothing in common with deciding on policies and working guidelines, which require careful and repeated thinking and opposition to impatience.

Peng, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, said in analyzing why our army is an invincible army: Our entire army has a high degree of confidence in defeating and completely eliminating the Hu-Ma bandit troops, which is very good. Many comrades say that we are an invincible army, and this is also very true. Historically, we are indeed invincible, but this statement cannot be understood abstractly. An invincible army must have the following conditions: First, it must have a correct political line; second, it must have a correct military line; third, it must have alert and flexible command; fourth, it must be united and closely rely on the people. The People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party, with the above four elements closely combined, is an invincible army. We have these conditions. For the first and second points, we have the leadership of the wise Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party. As long as we carefully study the central documents, especially the December 25th instructions of last year, we can guarantee that we will not make mistakes in the line. For the third point, we have more than 20 years of revolutionary war experience. As long as we are not arrogant, do not underestimate the enemy, and adopt a humble attitude of learning, alert and flexible command will be guaranteed. Fourth, we have the experience of the new-style military consolidation last winter. As long as we continue to raise the political consciousness of the entire army, continue to improve mass discipline, maintain the unity of the entire army, the unity of the army and the people, promote the spirit of hard struggle and seeking truth from facts, improve cadres serving soldiers, the entire army serving the people, and improve military technology and tactics, we will become an invincible army and will surely defeat the enemy and annihilate the enemy.

### 在西北前委会上　彭副总司令讲话　号召继续提高全军政治觉悟

　　在西北前委会上
  　彭副总司令讲话
  　号召继续提高全军政治觉悟
    【新华社西北前线二十日电】中国人民解放军副总司令彭德怀将军，顷在西北前线党委扩大会议闭幕时讲话，他除扼要的叙述了西北解放军在春季攻势中的伟大胜利及其经验教训外，着重的批判了小资产阶级个人主义的无政府思想，指出了反官僚主义的主要办法，并分析了我军为什么是不可战胜的军队。他说：小资产阶级不属于无产阶级范畴，而是属于资产阶级范畴的，若不经过严格的改造，则与全心全意为人民服务和服从共产主义是有很大距离的。我们党内小资产成份占相当数量，是值得注意的。小资产阶级特别突出的是个人主义的无政府思想。不愿意受组织的约束，在严重关头摇摆不定，在行动中考虑问题时是多从照顾自己个人得失发出，照顾自己小集团出发，而照顾全局是要在不捐害其个人利益与其小集团利益上，才是自然的，否则是不自然的，勉强的，甚至是对立的。这种弱点，处在严重的关头时，尤易自然的流出，以致违犯纪律，捐害革命利益都在所不顾。为克服这些现象，必须提高其觉悟程度，破坏其小资产阶级的思想意识，学习劳动人民的正气、坚决勇敢，自我牺牲的精神。如某部班长杨士德同志，在一次战斗中，被敌燃烧弹将其眉毛头发烧光，脸皮烧黑，身负重伤，连长指导员及其班内战士催促其下火线，杨同志考虑敌人正在反冲锋，班内无人指挥，坚决不下。有些同志为着完成爆炸任务，身绑火药，爬至敌人碉堡面前，自身与敌堡同时粉碎。这类英雄事迹，不止一次，而是无数次；不是强迫命令，而是完全出于自愿自动的行为。这些战斗英雄们为了人民事业而粉身碎骨，这种光荣伟大的自我牺牲精神，真是万世师表，永远值得我们学习的。他们这样高度的政治觉悟，英勇奋斗，与小资产者的个人打算，小集团打算，是没有任何相同点的。关于反对官僚主义的主要办法，他指出要走群众路线，发展批评与自我批评，工作深入下层，深入连队，反映群众意见，发现问题及时解决，总结群众中新的经验，贯彻与普及之。在日常工作中要求准确，反对借故拖延，反对借口不要急躁，待所谓“考虑考虑”，敷衍塞责任这都是官僚主义。这与决定政策，决定工作方针，要细心谨慎反复思考，反对急躁，没有任何共同点。
    彭副总司令在分析我军为什么是不可战胜的军队时说：我们全军有了高度战胜与彻底消灭胡马匪军的信心，这是很好的。很多同志讲我们是不可战胜的军队，这话也是很对的。从历史来看，我们的确是不可战胜的，但这句话不能抽象的了解。所以不可战胜的军队，必须具备下列条件：第一、要有正确的政治路线，第二、要有正确的军事路线，第三、要有机警灵活的指挥，第四、必须团结一致，紧紧依靠人民。以上四者密切结合了，在共产党领导下的人民解放军，才是不可战胜的军队。我们这些条件是具备的，第一、二两条，我们有了英明的毛泽东同志与中共中央的领导，只要我们细心研究中央文件，特别是去年十二月二十五日指示，就可保证不犯路线错误。第三条我们有了二十余年革命战争的经验，只要我们不骄傲，不轻敌，采取虚心学习的态度，机警灵活的指挥就有了保障。第四、我们已有了去冬新式整军的经验，只要继续提高全军的政治觉悟，继续提高群众纪律，保持全军团结一致，军民团结一致，提倡艰苦奋斗与实事求是的作风，提高干部为战士服务，全军为人民服务，提高军事技术、战术，我们就成为不可战胜的军队，而一定能战胜敌人，歼灭敌人。
