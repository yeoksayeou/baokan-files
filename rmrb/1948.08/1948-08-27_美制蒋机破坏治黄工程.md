[JiluYu Dispatch] US-made Chiang planes have been harassing the Yellow River control project for days. On the afternoon of the 16th, at 3:00 PM, while our side was rushing to repair the connecting embankments (i.e., revetment embankments) below the 18th dam of the Gao Cun dangerous section and the 12th section of the 7th dam, two US-made Chiang planes flew in from the south along the dike, and wildly strafed our repair workers and material transport boats and vehicles with machine guns and cannons, destroying one large material transport boat. The two planes wreaked havoc for up to twenty minutes before fleeing northeast towards the dangerous sections of Zhukou, Liuzhuang, and Linpu. On the morning of the 12th, at 10:00 AM, after strafing the Gao Cun emergency repair project, two Chiang planes again flew along the river to the Liuzhuang dangerous section in Nan Hua County, strafing the engineering team and transport workers who were repairing the dangerous embankment revetments. Subsequently, at Jiao Ji, a material transport boat was shot through in four places. They also flew along the river to the Linpu dangerous section in Juancheng, strafing our vehicles transporting materials. Furthermore, on the afternoon of August 17th, at 2:00 PM, two Chiang planes flew over Liqiao in Pu County, circling three times and dropping two bombs, fortunately without hitting the target. At 9:00 PM that evening, a Chiang plane again flew to Nanguan in Fan County, strafing for an hour and dropping six bombs, all of which landed in the city, injuring and killing five innocent civilians.
