Experience of Enlisting in the Army in the Jizhong-North Yue Region

　　Self-Registration, Public Discussion, and Leadership by Cadres and Party Members Results in Higher Quality Than Before

　　Strengthening Management and Education, Resolving Difficulties, and Consolidating New Soldiers

　　The Jizhong and North Yue regions launched an army enlistment campaign in the early summer of this year, and the first phase has concluded. The Political Department of the North China Supplementary Training Corps has made a preliminary summary of this enlistment campaign, which is briefly described below.

　　From the perspective of the composition and quality of the new soldiers, the results of this enlistment exceed any previous one. For example, among 1,500 new soldiers in Zhao County, 1,437 were middle and poor peasants, accounting for 80 percent. In Wutai, out of 852 new soldiers, 831 were middle and poor peasants. In Meng County, out of 1,216 new soldiers, middle and poor peasants accounted for 1,185. The proportion of Communist Party members enlisting in the army has greatly increased. For example, among the 852 new soldiers in Wutai, 204 were party members, accounting for 25 percent. In Meng County, out of 1,216 new soldiers, 432 were party members, accounting for over 35 percent.

　　The reasons for achieving the above results, in addition to the basic condition of increased awareness among peasants after land reform, are the following points from a leadership perspective:

　　First and foremost, it is worth mentioning the implementation of the two principles of self-registration and public discussion, and public discussion and self-registration. For example, in Zhaobei Luo Village, Tang County, after explaining the significance of joining the army at a mass mobilization meeting, the leadership organized group discussions. First, the conditions for new soldiers were proposed, and then the goals were discussed. After repeated mobilization and deliberation, 18 families were publicly recommended, all of whom had two or more young people. This exceeded the district's assignment by six people. The new soldiers automatically stipulated an army enlistment pact, guaranteeing that they would not desert and that those at home would ensure good production for the military families according to the substitute farming regulations, truly achieving rationality and willingness, which greatly satisfied the masses. Therefore, there were many examples of parents sending their sons and wives sending their husbands to join the army. At one enlistment mobilization meeting in Gou'an Village, Zhao County, there were seven model mothers, eleven model fathers, and one model wife who encouraged their sons and husbands to join the army, and sixteen young adults automatically signed up.

　　Secondly, the leading role of cadres and the exemplary role of party members promoted the army enlistment movement. At a joint meeting of county and district cadres in Jingxing County, the county party committee first cleared the thinking of the cadres, calling on the cadres to take the lead in joining the army. The deputy secretary of the county party committee and thirty others signed up on the spot, with twenty-two approved by the county party committee. After Jia Zhaoxiang, the district chief of the Sixth District of Zhao County, signed up to join the army at a small district farmers' meeting, forty-five people, including Wang Erxiao, who had worked as a farmhand for eighteen years, volunteered to go to the front line with District Chief Jia. Zhang Dajuan, a female party member in Wuji County, even wrote a letter urging her fiancé to join the army. The increased proportion of party members enlisting in the army has already been mentioned above.

　　Thirdly, the personal responsibility of local party and government leaders, strengthening management and education, and solving practical difficulties have greatly consolidated the new soldiers. In Xian County, Jiaohe, Xianjiao, and other counties in the Eighth Sub-district of Jizhong, after the new soldiers were concentrated, elementary school teachers were organized to perform plays and storytelling, and the county magistrate personally went to each company to talk to the soldiers, collect opinions, and solve difficulties. Anguo, Shenze, and other counties convened an enlarged district and village cadre meeting and a get-together with new soldiers before their departure, answering and solving various difficult questions raised by the new soldiers at the meeting. The county magistrate and county party secretary personally sent the new soldiers to the training location, lived with the new soldiers, and did not return until all the problems of the new soldiers were completely clarified. Comrade Li Xiuming, a propaganda cadre of Xinle County, was very active. She patiently educated and encouraged every party member who enlisted in the army, solicited their opinions, and told them the role party members should play after they arrived at the army. Only one party member new soldier in the county deserted. The deputy secretary and deputy commissioner of the Second Prefectural Committee and the armed forces minister of the Fourth Prefectural Committee personally went to the new soldiers' corps to solve the difficulties of the new soldiers. This spirit of seriousness, responsibility, and perseverance in carrying out a task to the end played a great role in the education and consolidation of the new soldiers.

　　However, some places also adopted the opposite and erroneous lines and methods. Some villages and cadres in Xushui, Hunyuan, Ding County, and Xingtang still retained serious old work styles of coercion and commandism, a purely numerical viewpoint, and the view that pushing people out the door meant the task was completed. They did not pay attention to methods, did not emphasize quality, and did not strengthen education, resulting in serious desertion among new soldiers in individual districts and villages. Xushui's Seventh District launched a crash campaign to expand the army, assigning the task one day and "completing" it the next, resulting in the mass desertion of new soldiers. This bad work style must be seriously overcome.

### 冀中北岳参军经验  自报公议干部党员带头质量超过以往  加强管理教育解决困难巩固了新战士

　　冀中北岳参军经验
    自报公议干部党员带头质量超过以往
    加强管理教育解决困难巩固了新战士
    冀中、北岳两区今年夏初展开参军运动，第一期已告结束。华北补训兵团政治部对于此次参军运动作出初步总结，简述于后。
    这次参军成绩，从新战士成份质量上看，超过已往任何一次。如赵县一五○○名新战士中，中农贫农有一四三七人，占百分之八十。五台八五二名新战士中，中、贫农八三一名。盂县一二一六名新战士中，中贫农占一一八五名。共产党员参军比重大增，如五台新战士八五二名中，党员有二○四名，占百分之二十五。盂县一二一六名新战士中，党员四三二名，占百分之三十五强。
    取得以上成绩的原因，除了农民在土改后觉悟提高这个基本条件外，从领导上看有以下几点：
    首先值得提出的是贯彻了自报公议与公议自报两条原则，如唐县赵北罗村，领导上在动员群众参军大会上说明参军意义后，群众即分组讨论，先提出新战士的条件，再讨论目标，经反复动员酝酿，公议出十八家，均系一家有两个以上青年的。超过区布置数六名。新战士自动规定参军公约，保证不开小差，在家的按代耕条例，保证把军属生产作好，真正做到合理自愿，群众非常满意。因此父母送儿子，妻子送丈夫参军的例子很多。赵县沟岸村在一个参军动员大会上，即有七个模范母亲，十一个模范父亲，一个模范妻子，劝子送夫参军，十六个青壮年自动报名。
    其次，干部带头与党员的模范作用，推动了参军运动。井陉县委在县区干部联席会上，首先打通干部思想，号召干部带头参军，当场即有县委副书记等三十人报名，经县委批准者二十二人。赵县六区区长贾兆祥在小区农民大会上报名参军后，当场就有扛过十八年长工的王二小等四十五人，愿和贾区长一块上前线。无极县妇女党员张大鸾更去信催其未婚夫参军。此次党员参军比重增多，已如前述。
    第三、地方党政首长亲自负责，加强管理教育，解决实际困难，大大巩固了新战士。冀中八分区献县、交河、献交等县，在新战士集中后，组织小学教员演戏，说大鼓书，县长亲到各连找战士谈话，搜集意见，解决困难。安国、深泽等县在新战士出发前召集扩大的区村干部会与新战士联欢，在会上解答与解决新战士所提各种困难问题。县长县委书记亲送新战士到集训地点，和新战士一块生活，直到把新战士所有问题全部搞清后才回去。新乐县在新战士未到前，首先以新参军的区村干部，并暂时抽出一批在职干部，设几个连的架子，新战士来了，即认真进行审查教育。县委宣传干事李秀明同志非常积极，对每一个参军的党员耐心地进行教育鼓励，征求他们意见，并告诉他们到部队后党员应起的作用；该县党员新战士仅有一人逃亡。二地委副书记副专员、四地委武装部长都亲到新兵团解决新战士的困难。这种严肃负责、对于一件工作贯彻始终的精神，对于新战士的教育和巩固起了很大作用。
    但是有些地方，也采取了相反的错误的路线与方式，徐水、浑源、定县、行唐等县的某些村庄某些干部，残存着严重的强迫命令的旧作风、单纯数字观点和推出门去就算完成任务的观点，不讲究方式，不注重质量，不加强教育，以致个别区村的新战士发生严重的逃亡现象，徐水七区突击扩军，一天布置，一天“完成”，结果新战士大批逃亡。这种不良作风，必须认真克服。
