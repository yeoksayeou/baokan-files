(Taiyue Telegram) The Wei Xiaoban Mutual Aid Team in Linjian Village, Yangcheng, unites all classes in production and teaches landlords to labor. The Wei Xiaoban Mutual Aid Team originally consisted of one poor peasant household and eight middle peasant households. Later, it absorbed two households, Wang Tianyi and Wang Huxiang, who remained landlords even after the land redistribution. During the summer harvest, Wang Tianyi initially didn't know how to cut wheat, his back ached and he couldn't bend over, so he could only cut half to two-thirds of what others could. The team members were determined to teach him how to cut wheat, and gradually he cut faster. By the third day, his back didn't hurt, and he could keep up with the others. When weeding the seedlings, the landlords didn't know how to remove weeds and keep the seedlings, nor did they know how to ridge the soil. The team members taught him how to keep the seedlings and how to ridge the soil. With this instruction, the landlords quickly learned and began to get used to labor. Currently, the entire team has weeded the cotton fields three times, and the hemp, corn, and millet fields have been weeded twice. The old wheat fields have also been plowed twice.

　　卫小板互助组教会地主劳动
    【太岳电】阳城临涧村卫小板互助组，团结各阶层生产，并教会地主劳动。卫小板互助组原有一户贫农、八户中农，以后又吸收了两户平分土地以后仍是地主成份的王天乙、王虎祥。夏收时，王天乙起初不会割麦，腰疼弯不下，只能割别人的一半到三分之二，组里的人决心教他割麦的方法，慢慢的就割快了，到第三天腰也不疼，也能跟上别人割了。锄小苗时地主又不会破草留苗，也不会拥埝堆锄，组里人又教他怎样留苗，怎样拥埝堆，这样一教，地主很快也学会了，也开始习惯劳动了。现全组棉花地已锄过三遍，大麻玉茭谷子地都锄过了两遍，老麦地也犁过两遍。
