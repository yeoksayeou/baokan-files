　　Nanhedi Real Goods Credit Cooperative Introduction
    [Taihang News] A correspondent continues to report on the organizational process and operating status of the Nanhedi Real Goods Credit Cooperative in the ninth district of Wu'an, stating: The village has a total of 223 households, with an average of four mu of land per person. The soil quality is very poor, and relying solely on agricultural income is not enough to maintain a living. Therefore, many villagers engage in transportation during the slack farming seasons of winter and spring. In 1942, under the leadership of Comrade Zhang Xigui (born as a hired worker, a new middle peasant, and elected as a second-class Taihang cooperative hero in 1946; mistakenly written as Zhang Xigui on the first page of this newspaper on July 23), a village cooperative was established. It served the masses' production and organized them to engage in sideline occupations, achieving remarkable results. In March 1946, Comrade Zhang Xigui returned from a meeting at the commissioner's office and called for the organization of a credit department, holding meetings to mobilize the masses to invest and deposit shares. At that time, the farmers generally reflected, "It would be good to get loans, but what if deposits lose money?" No one was willing to deposit, and the credit department failed to be established. In the winter of 1947, when the masses were engaged in winter production, they requested loans; the cooperative could not draw a large amount of funds to meet the masses' demands. Comrade Zhang Xigui and the village cadres made preliminary studies and convened a mass meeting, proposing the method of "depositing real goods and lending real goods." At that time, most people agreed, but a few people misunderstood depositing real goods, saying, "The Land Law Outline is about to be implemented. Aren't you afraid of equal distribution if you deposit grain in the credit department?" "If the grain is deposited, will you only be able to take a little at a time?" Comrade Zhang Xigui repeatedly explained to everyone, "The deposited grain will never be equally distributed. Whoever wants to join can join, and whoever doesn't want to join doesn't have to. Join as much as you want, join if it benefits you, don't join if it doesn't, take it whenever you want to take it, it is completely voluntary, and there is absolutely no coercion." At the meeting, the issue of interest on depositing and lending real goods was discussed, and it was decided that interest on depositing real goods would not be calculated monthly, and dividends would be distributed once every three months. The interest on lending real goods was divided into two types: for those engaged in animal-drawn transportation, the monthly interest was three jin per hundred jin of grain; for those carrying goods with shoulder poles, it was two and a half jin. After repeated deliberation by the masses, it was unanimously agreed that this was a good method. Depositors would not lose money and could also generate interest, and borrowers would have capital for production. Soon after the meeting, more than sixty households deposited grain and cotton. Items that were not easy to sell in the market were not accepted. Zhang Erhao, a new middle peasant, deposited one hundred jin of millet and kept it for seven months. He said, "In the autumn, I harvested six shi of grain. I can't finish eating it right now, and rats will spoil it if I keep it at home. If I deposit it in the credit department, someone will keep it for me, and it will also generate some interest." Most of the initial depositors thought this way.
    The deposited real goods are used and taken at any time. Some people regard the credit department as their storage, depositing in large quantities and taking out in small amounts. Liu Niushan from the eighth group deposited twenty jin of cotton on November 23rd last year, took out two jin in early February this year, took out ten jin on the twelfth, and another three and a half jin on the thirteenth. The masses felt it was very convenient. There was no limit to the amount of grain deposited, some four or five hundred jin, some twenty or thirty jin. The number of borrowers gradually increased: last year, in November of the lunar calendar, there were only six borrowers, borrowing a total of 525 jin of millet and 120 jin of salt. In December, there were two borrowers, borrowing a total of 774.5 jin of millet. In January, there were fifteen borrowers, borrowing a total of 3373 jin of millet. In February, there were thirteen borrowers, borrowing a total of 2489 jin of millet, 2214 jin of corn, and 728 jin of wheat. With the increase in borrowers, the supply of deposited real goods could not meet the demand. The cooperative also lent out some of the temporarily unused materials (such as wheat and millet, about 1,000 jin). The term of the loans is indefinite, mostly for one month. After the term expires, the interest can be paid off and the loan can be continued. In addition to the villagers, there are also neighbors from neighboring villages, such as seven households from Beihedi and one household from Shanling Village. This shows that the masses support the deposit and loan of real goods. Among the borrowers, there are twenty new middle peasants, fifteen old middle peasants, and one poor peasant. The main purpose of the loans is to engage in transportation production. Only one household borrowed grain to buy livestock, and no one borrowed grain to eat. According to statistics from twenty-five households, the profit from lending real goods for production varies depending on the size of the transportation capacity and the amount of profit: for the four households with one animal-drawn cart per person, the highest daily profit is 32.8 percent, and the lowest is 10.2 percent; for the nine households with two animal-drawn carts per person, the highest profit is 38.8 percent, and the lowest is 10.4 percent; for the four households with three animal-drawn carts per person, the highest profit is 38.8 percent, and the lowest is 18.3 percent; only three households lost money because they were not good at management.
    Storing real goods is more troublesome than storing currency, and good leadership must be maintained. In order to save expenses and facilitate leadership, the credit department is not independent and is attached to the cooperative. No special person is appointed, and the cooperative accountant is responsible for keeping the accounts, and the director of the cooperative directly leads. Zhang Xigui and the deputy director often understand and check the production situation of the borrowers, each responsible for four mutual aid groups, diligently look at the accounts, and tell the borrowers to "turn over the money frequently and not leave it idle." If they find that borrowers are using the funds improperly, they immediately persuade them to correct it to prevent losses. When the loan of a household is due, they go to urge collection. This year, in January of the lunar calendar, Liu Xizhu temporarily stopped production and lent the money he had exchanged for the millet he borrowed last winter to others. Zhang Xigui discovered this and immediately told him, "The price of grain is rising day by day. You will suffer a loss if you lend the money to others. If you are not going to produce now, quickly ask for the money back and buy grain to repay the credit department." Xizhu listened to him and did as he said, and as a result, he did not suffer a loss.

　　南河底实物信用社介绍
    【太行讯】通讯员继续报导武安九区南河底实物信用合作社的组织经过及经营状况称：该村共二二三户，每人平均四亩地，土质很坏，只靠农业收入不够维持生活。因此该村群众在冬春农闲季节，搞运输的很多。一九四二年，在张喜贵同志（雇工出身，新中农，一九四六年被选为太行二等合作英雄。七月廿三日本报一版上误为张西贵）领导下成立了村合作社。为群众生产服务组织群众搞副业，成效卓著。一九四六年三月，张喜贵同志从专署开会回来，曾经号召组织信用部，开会动员群众入股存股。农民当时普遍反映：“能贷款倒是好，但存款赔了本怎办？”没有人愿意存款，信用部未能成立起来。一九四七年冬，群众进行冬季生产，要求贷款；合作社不能抽出大批资金满足群众要求。张喜贵同志和村干部作了初步研究，召开群众大会，提出“存实物，贷实物”的办法。当时多数人都同意，只少数人对存实物发生误解，他们说：“土地法大纲要下来了，把粮食存到信用部不怕平分吧？”“粮食存进去，是不是吃一点才能拿一点呀！”张喜贵同志再三向大家解说：“存的粮食绝不被平分，谁愿入谁入，谁不愿入就不入，愿入多少入多少，对你有利就入，没利就不要入，何时想取就取，完全自愿，绝不强迫。”在大会上讨论了存贷实物的利息问题，决定存实物不按月计利息，三个月结帐分一次红。贷实物利息分两种：赶牲口运输的，每百斤粮每月利息三斤；担挑的二斤半。经过群众一再酝酿，一致认为：这倒是个好办法，存的人赔不了本，还能生利，贷的人又有了生产本钱。会后不久就有六十多户存粮食存棉花的，市场上不容易出售的东西则不吸收。新中农张二郝存小米一百斤，存了七个月，他说：“秋天我打谷子六石，眼下吃不完，放在家里老鼠还糟踏，存到信用部有人给咱保存，又能生个利。”最初的存户大半是这样想法。
    存的实物都是随时用，随时取，有的人将信用部当做他们的保管，大批存入，零星取用。八组刘牛山去年十一月廿三日存棉花二十斤，今年二月初取了二斤，十二日取了十斤，十三日又取了三斤半。群众感觉很方便，存粮的数量没有限制，有的四五百斤，有的二三十斤。贷户逐渐增加：去年旧历十一月贷户只有六户，共贷五二五斤小米、一二○斤盐。十二月贷户二户，共贷小米七七四斤半。正月份贷户十五户，共贷小米三三七三斤。二月贷户十三户，共贷小米二四八九斤，玉茭二二一四斤，麦子七二八斤。贷户增加了，存的实物供不应求，合作社把一部分暂时不用的物资（如麦子、小米约一千多斤）也贷出去。贷户的期限不定，大半是一月为期，期满了付清利息可以继续贷。贷户除了本村的以外，还有邻村如北河底七户，擅岭村一户。这说明群众对实物存贷是拥护的。贷户成份，新中农二十户，老中农十五户，贫农一户。贷户用途主要是搞运输生产，贷粮食买牲口的只有一户，没有贷粮食吃的。贷实物生产的利润，据二十五户的统计看，按运输力大小和盈利多少而不同：一个人赶一个牲口的四户，每日最高利润是百分之三十二点八，最低百分之十点二；一个人赶两个牲口的九户，最高利润百分之三八点八，最低百分之十点四；一个人赶三个牲口的四户，最高利润三八点八，最低十八点三；只有三户因为本人不会经营赔了本。
    存放实物比存放货币麻烦的多，在领导上必须很好的掌握。为了节省开支和便利领导，信用部不独立，附属于合作社内，不设专人，由合作社会计代记帐目，社长直接领导。张喜贵和副社长经常了解和检查贷户的生产情况，每人分工负责四个互助组，勤翻帐目，告诉贷户“勤周转，不要把钱闲放着。”发现贷户用款不当，立即说服纠正，防止赔钱。那户借贷的到期了就去催收，今年正月刘喜柱暂时不去生产，把去冬贷米换成的钱借给别人使用，张喜贵发现了，立即告诉他：“粮食一天一天涨，你把钱借给别人要吃亏，现在不去生产，就快点把钱要回来，买成粮食还信用部。”喜柱听了他的话，照着作了，结果没有吃亏。　（杨方勋）
