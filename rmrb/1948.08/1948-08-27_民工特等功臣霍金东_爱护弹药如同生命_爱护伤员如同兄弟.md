(Taiyue Electric) Among the civilian laborers from Yangcheng participating in the Jinzhong Campaign, many outstanding people's heroes emerged. Huo Jindong, one of the Special Class Heroes, fully demonstrated the enthusiasm, bravery, and resourcefulness of liberated peasants, and created many exemplary deeds.

Cherishing ammunition like cherishing one's own life, Huo Jindong always hid the ammunition first before hiding himself each time he delivered ammunition to the front lines. When it rained, he would use his straw hat and clothes to cover the ammunition, never letting it get wet. He often advised others, "It's better to get ourselves wet than to let the ammunition get wet. With ammunition, we can win." After the Xiaochang battle, Huo Jindong and Xu Wanxi and two others went to buy vegetables. Local people told them that when the Yan bandits fled in panic, they had thrown weapons and ammunition into the well. Upon hearing this, Huo Jindong risked going down into the well and indeed retrieved five machine guns, two small cannons, a grenade launcher, more than 170 rounds of ammunition, and two rifles.

Caring for the wounded as if they were his own brothers, Huo Jindong went to the front lines to rescue the wounded during the Zhanglan battle. At that time, a group of Yan bandits was breaking through from the north gate to escape. One of our soldiers was wounded and fell near the north gate. Huo Jindong bravely crept up to the wounded soldier and carried him down. During the Haojiabao battle, he boiled water for the wounded to drink and spread his own quilt for the wounded to lie on, not caring if it got stained with blood. In the Xiangyuan battle in Pingyao, a deputy battalion commander was killed and had nothing to wrap the body with. He first wrapped the body with his own quilt, then got a mat, covered the corpse, and piled stones around it. This greatly inspired the soldiers. Many soldiers said gratefully, "This fellow villager is so good. The army and the people are truly one family. We can die in peace."

He has a good spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity. Huo Jindong is young and strong, and he often helps others carry things. Once, the rice and flour carried by Old Man Wu Zhengji were too heavy, so Jindong helped him carry his luggage on his carrying pole. When stationed in Shangzhuang, he helped Li Bing deliver ammunition to the front lines for a whole day. When he had nothing to do, he would help the cooks carry water and chop firewood, delivering food to the front lines, walking ten miles every day.

He has a high sense of responsibility. In Zhanglan Town, Dongjin was eating when wounded soldiers came down from the front lines. It was supposed to be delivered by the Second Battalion. He was from the First Battalion, but seeing that there was no one else, he immediately put down his rice bowl and carried the wounded to the hospital with the cook.

He abides by discipline. Huo Jindong not only refrains from the slightest violation himself, but also often advises others, criticizing and correcting anyone he sees doing something wrong. Once, Xu Wanxi took a pair of bronze chopsticks from the people of Pingyao Village. Dongjin immediately criticized him and corrected him. Under his influence, everyone's discipline improved.

　　民工特等功臣霍金东
  　爱护弹药如同生命　爱护伤员如同兄弟
    【太岳电】阳城参加晋中战役的民工中，出现了很多出色的人民功臣。其中特等功臣之一的霍东金，充分表现了翻身农民热情、勇敢、机警的特点，创造了很多模范事迹。
    爱护弹药如同爱护自己的生命，霍东金每次送弹药到前方，总是先把弹药隐蔽好，才隐蔽自己。下雨时，拿自己的草帽衣服把弹药盖好，从不叫淋湿一点。他常劝别人说：“宁可淋湿自己，可不敢淋湿弹药，有弹药就能胜利。”小常战斗后，霍东金和许晚喜等三人去买菜，听当地老百姓说：阎匪慌乱逃跑时，曾把武器弹药丢在井里。霍东金听了这话，就冒险下去，果然捞起了五挺机枪，两门小炮，一个掷弹筒，子弹一百七十余发，步枪两支。
    爱护伤员就如爱护自己的弟兄一样。张兰战斗中，霍东金到火线上抢救伤员，当时有股阎匪正从北门突围逃跑。我们一个战士负了伤，倒在北门附近，霍东金勇敢的摸到伤员跟前，把伤员背下来。郝家堡战斗中给伤员烧水喝，把自己的被子给伤员铺上，血污了也不管。在平遥的香园战斗中，有个副营长阵亡了，没东西包，他先用自己的被子把他裹好，又去领了席子，把尸首盖起来用石头垒住，这给战士鼓动很大。许多战士感激的说：“这老乡太好了，军民真是一家人，死也安心。”
    互助友爱精神好。霍东金人也年青，气力又大，常常帮助别人担东西。有次吴正计老汉担的米面太重，东金就捎担上他的行李。在上庄驻扎时，又帮助李丙来往前方送了一天弹药，没事的时候，就帮炊事员担水劈柴，往前方送饭，一走十来里，天天忙。
    有高度的责任心。在张兰镇时，东金正在吃饭，从前线下来了伤员，本该二营送。他是一营的人，看见没有别人，他立刻放下饭碗，和伙夫抬上送到了医院。
    遵守纪律。霍东金不光自己做到秋毫无犯，还常劝导其他人，看见谁有不对，就要批评纠正。有次许晚喜拿了平遥庄老百姓一双铜筷子，东金立即批评他，改正了。在他的影响下，大家的纪律也都好了。
