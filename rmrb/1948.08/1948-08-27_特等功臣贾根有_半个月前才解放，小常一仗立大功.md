　　Special-Class Merit Citation Recipient Jia Genyou
　　Xiao Chang Achieves Great Merit in Battle Just Half a Month After Liberation
　　In the Xiao Chang battle on the Jinzhong Front, Jia Genyou, a special-class hero from a certain brigade, is a 19-year-old youth who was liberated from the Zhanglan battle just half a month ago. He joined the People's Liberation Army the day after his liberation. In half a month of marching and fighting, Jia Genyou further understood that the People's Liberation Army is the people's own army. He said, "In the past half month, the company commander and instructor treated me like their own brother, caring for me at all times. During battles, the veteran comrades were in the front, leading me. This made me realize that the Liberation Army is the home I love."
　　During the Xiao Chang battle, he participated in the assault squad. When the troops approached the village and occupied the first courtyard, Jia Genyou was the first to climb onto the roof. Just as he got on the roof, shrapnel pierced his left leg. He gritted his teeth and pulled out the half of the shrapnel that was still exposed from his flesh. Then, he jumped to the roof of the second house and fought the enemies in the courtyard with hand grenades. Finally, he threw a blasting charge, and all eighteen enemies in the courtyard surrendered their guns.
　　They fought four courtyards, and Jia Genyou always ran in the front. Comrades told him to charge more steadily, and he said, "To fight Yan Xishan's troops, you have to approach quickly. If we approach quickly, their officials will waver. If we approach slowly, the officials won't be afraid and will force the soldiers to resist." When he charged to the fifth courtyard, the enemies saw his hand grenades thrown into the courtyard and all went into the big house. Jia Genyou alone guarded the door of the house and warned the enemies inside, "Quickly lay down your weapons and receive preferential treatment. If you don't surrender, I will throw hand grenades." The enemies crowded in the house hurriedly said, "We surrender, we surrender." When Deputy Squad Leader Lu Daishun and Deng Heqing came over, the 178 enemies in the house had already walked out of the courtyard with their hands raised. (Chun Xun)

　　特等功臣贾根有
  　半个月前才解放，小常一仗立大功
    晋中前线某旅在小常战斗中，涌现出的特功英雄——贾根有，是个十九岁的青年，半个月前才在张兰战斗中解放过来的。他在解放后第二天便参加了人民解放军。在半个月的行军作战中，贾根有进一步认识了解放军是人民自己的军队，他说：“半个月来，连长指导员待我如同亲兄弟，时刻关心我，打起仗来老同志在前边，带领着我，这使我认清了解放军是我热爱的家。”
    小常战斗时，他参加了突击班。部队近村边占领第一座院子时，贾根有第一个爬上了房顶，刚刚上房，手榴弹片便冲进他的左腿，他咬着牙关，把半截还露在外边的弹片从肉里拔了出来。接着，跳到第二座房顶上，和院里的敌人拼手榴弹。最后他打了一个炸药包，院里十八个敌人都缴了枪。
    他们打了四座院子，贾根有一直跑到前边。同志们告他冲的稳些，他说：“打阎匪军就得快点接近，我们接近的快了，他们当官的就动摇了，接近的慢了当官的不怕，还要逼着士兵抵抗。”当他冲到第五座院子时，敌人见他的手榴弹打到院里，都钻进大房子去了，贾根有一个人把住房门，向屋里的敌人警告说：“赶快放下武器受优待，你们不缴枪，我就打手榴弹。”挤满在屋子里的敌人慌慌忙忙的说：“缴枪，我们缴枪。”当副班长吕代顺和登何庆二人过来时，屋子里的一百七十八个敌人已举着手走出院来。（春旬）
