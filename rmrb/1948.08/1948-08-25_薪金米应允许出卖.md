　　Salary Rice Should Be Allowed to Be Sold
    To the Editor:
    I am a clerk at Wu'an High School, and there are some difficulties I cannot resolve, please answer:
    The cadres of the high school are all on a salary system (teachers and staff receive 130 catties of rice per month), and clothing, food money, shoes, socks, and medical expenses are all resolved from this, but the Second Section does not allow the sale of rice, saying that public grain rice is not allowed to be sold. We have to hire a car to pull the rice back to the school from dozens of miles away in the city, but when we pull it back, there is no way to deal with it, so we have to sell it secretly. Does this count as making a mistake? What should we do if we are not allowed to sell rice?

    Answer: We have asked the Education Department to reply to your question as follows:
    For salaried teachers and staff, clothing, food money, shoes, socks, medical expenses, etc., should all be resolved from the salary rice. The Second Section's ban on selling rice may be referring to general supply system organs. Salaried workers should be allowed to sell it. However, the Second Section's ban on you selling rice, is it because you are selling a large amount of grain collectively, which may affect market price fluctuations, or are there things to pay attention to in the way you sell it? In short, if you want to sell salary rice, you can discuss a reasonable solution with the First and Second Sections, and it should be done in a way that does not affect grain prices.

　　薪金米应允许出卖
    编辑同志：
    我是武安高小的一个事务员，有些困难无法解决请答复：
    高小干部都是薪金制（教职员每月都是一百三十斤米），衣服菜金、鞋袜医药费都是从这里解决，但二科又不让卖米，说公粮米不准卖，我们只好把米从城里几十里地雇车拉回学校，但拉回去还没办法，只好偷偷去卖，这算不算犯错误，不让卖米怎么办。

    答：你的问题我们已请教育厅答复如下：
    薪金制的教职员，衣服、菜金、鞋袜、医药等费，都是应当从薪金米里解决的，二科不让卖米，可能是对一般供给制的机关而言，薪金制的应该允许出卖，但二科不让你们卖米，是否因你们集中多数米粮出卖，可能影响市价变动，或者出卖方式上有应注意的地方，总之，如欲出卖薪金米时，可与一科二科商讨出合理解决办法，并以不影响粮价为妥。
