    Pingshan Promotion Agency
    No Seeds Prepared Before the Rain
    Blamed by the Masses After the Rain
    [Our Dispatch] The Pingshan County Production Promotion Agency, due to not preparing seeds for short-term crops before the rain, is now in a frantic state. Seeds cannot be bought, losing its role in promoting production at the most critical moment. The production work instructions issued by the Commissioner's Office on July 10th already pointed out the need for early preparation for emergency use after the rain. Deputy Section Chief Wang of the County Industry and Commerce Department also instructed the Promotion Agency to go out and purchase seeds more than ten days ago. However, because the director of the agency had returned home and was not present, there was no one to take care of it. In addition, the buckwheat seeds bought last year were not sold and lost money. As of July 25th, the agency had nothing except 80 jin of turnip seeds left over from last year. On the 26th, the agency sent people out to buy, but only obtained two shi in two days, far from enough to meet the needs. According to reports, buckwheat seeds are in short supply in the first, second, and sixth districts of Pingshan after this rain. The first district alone is short of 25 to 30 da shi and there is no way to solve it. At the Huisher market (24th), the price of buckwheat rose from 15,000 to 24,000 per dou. Even those selling pa gao (a kind of cake) also sold their buckwheat. About 20 shi of buckwheat at the entire market, except for more than one shi of poor quality, were snapped up. Although six villages including Beiwanglou in the second district borrowed, exchanged, and sold on credit 4 shi and 6 dou of buckwheat from the fruits of victory, and the masses also tried to help and purchase some, the seed problem was still not completely solved. Gao Fuxing of Meng'erzhuang said: "I only have more than two sheng of buckwheat seeds for more than five mu of land. I can't plant more even if I want to." The Nanwanglou village finished exchanging all the eight dou of buckwheat stored by the farmers' association, but people were still asking to exchange. Someone from Dongwanglou went to the market twice a day (eight li away from the market) but still couldn't buy any. Wang Shunzi of Duicheng searched the streets for buckwheat but couldn't find any. According to the village cadres' estimate, about one-third of the households in the village have difficulty with seeds. Donghuishe sold on credit the four or five dou of buckwheat from the fruits of victory and the two shi purchased on behalf of the veteran preferential treatment agency, but it was still not enough. Beiwanglou asked those who needed buckwheat seeds to register. The first four people who went heard that they had to pay 17,000 yuan in cash per dou to buy them from the County Promotion Agency, and were very disappointed. The others who were preparing to go also gave up. They said, "We don't have money, let's forget it!" When the reporter asked a farmer on the street how to solve the seed problem, seven or eight people immediately gathered around, asking the reporter to write a letter of introduction to the County Promotion Agency to buy buckwheat seeds on credit. In this situation, some comrades of the Promotion Agency still shirk their responsibilities, saying: "The five dou we prepared (originally bought two shi, nine dou allocated to the first district, and six dou have not been transported back) have been left for a day and no one has come to buy," to prove that the masses do not need much. But this kind of talk was immediately rebuked by the masses. The masses of Gaojiazhuang said: "If you lend us real objects and return real objects, there are many of us who need seeds!" (Note: The county's Promotion Agency adopts the method of reselling instead of lending.) The current seed shortage is the first and biggest obstacle. In order to complete the work of seizing the planting season, we suggest that the Promotion Agency change its current method and quickly and reasonably lend the buckwheat seeds that are about to be bought back to the masses.

    平山推进社
    雨前没有准备种籽
    雨后受到群众责备
    【本报讯】平山县生产推进社，雨前由于对短期作物种籽没有准备，现在手忙脚乱，籽种买不到手，在最紧要的关头失去了推进生产的作用。在七月十日专署发出的生产工作指示中即指出早作准备，以备雨后急用，县实业科王副科长十几天前也曾吩咐推进社外出购买，但由于该社主任回家未归，无人照料，加以去年买的荞麦种未卖出，赔了钱，至七月廿五日该社除去年留下的八十斤蔓菁籽外，毫无所有。廿六日，该社虽派人出去收买，但两天只得二石，不敷需要甚远。按此次雨后平山一、二、六区荞麦种籽都很缺，仅一区就缺二十五到三十大石没法解决。回舍上集（廿四日）荞麦每斗由一万五涨至二万四，卖爬糕的也将荞麦卖了，全集约二十石荞麦，除成色太坏的一石多外，被抢购一空。二区北望楼等六村虽由胜利果实中借出、换出、赊出荞麦四石六斗，群众自己亦设法周济、购买一部，但种籽问题仍未全部解决。孟耳庄高福兴说：“五亩多地只有二升多荞麦种，想多种也不行。”南望楼把农会存的八斗荞麦换完了，仍有人要求换；东望楼有人一天赶两次集（距集八里）仍没买到。对城王顺子满街找荞麦也找不到，据村干估计，该村种籽困难的户约为三分之一；东回舍将果实中四、五斗荞麦与优军社代买的两石赊出，仍不够用。北望楼叫需要荞麦种的去登记。先去的四个人听说要以一万七现款一斗去县推进社购买，很感失望，其他准备去的人也不去了。他们说：“咱没钱，算了吧！”记者于街头问一农民种籽的如何解决时，瞬间即有七、八人围来，纷纷要求记者写介绍信到县推进社赊荞麦籽。在这种情况下，推进社某些同志仍推卸责任说：“我们准备的五斗（原买二石，九斗拨予一区，六斗尚未运回），放了一天无人来买”，以证明群众不大需要。但还种讲话立即遭到群众的纷纷责备，郜家庄群众说：“假如你们借实物还实物，我们要籽种的人多着哩！”（按：该县推进社采取转卖而不是借贷的办法。）当前种籽困难是第一个最大的障碍。为完成抢种工作日，我们建议推进社改变现在的办法，把即将买回的荞麦籽迅速的合理的贷给群众。（何建平、白玉峰）
