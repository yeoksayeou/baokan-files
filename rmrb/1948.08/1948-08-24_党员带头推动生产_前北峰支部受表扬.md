(Jinan Electric) Under the full leadership of the Qian Beifeng Village Branch of the Communist Party and the exemplary influence of its members, the village's production has taken a step forward. After village cadres and Party members resolved the ideological obstacle of "no need for leadership" in production, they actively led the masses in weeding, accumulating fertilizer, and preparing for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Branch Secretary Kong Fanxing took the lead in making a production plan, striving to plant 22 mu of wheat, accumulate 27 large carts of fertilizer, and buy another 600 jin of rapeseed cakes as fertilizer. He guaranteed that the five mu of corn would be weeded four times. Branch Committee member Kong Lingxian planned to plant 24 mu of wheat and planned to sell a large pig and buy some manure to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage on ten mu of land. Militia Captain Cheng Henhai planned to push rapeseed in the west of the Wei River and earn money to buy fertilizer. Each member of the branch made a plan, and the branch committee specifically discussed how to lead the masses in production. Immediately, an enlarged cadre meeting and a mass meeting were held to explain the Party's production policy of rewarding production and getting rich, calling on the masses to weed more land, accumulate more fertilizer, and save for famine. Under the full leadership of the branch and the active leadership of Party members and cadres, a production competition was launched between groups and individuals, and the masses were extremely enthusiastic. In order to prevent the competition from becoming a mere formality, all village cadres went deep into the streets, households, and land to conduct inspections. It was found that Cheng Tang's seven mu of spring millet was deeply weeded and weed-free, and the millet seedlings were more than four feet tall. Kong Fengju, fourteen years old, had weeded her corn three times, and there were no weeds in the field. Kong Dexing's group, due to insufficient agricultural tools, hoed 16 mu of seedlings under the moonlight for two nights. These model examples were broadcast and praised in a timely manner, and the phenomena of unenthusiastic production such as Kong Qingshen's melon field being full of Tribulus terrestris, Kong Qingtai being young and strong but not working, Cheng Zeng's manure pit being idle, the weeds in the field being old and tall without weeding, and Kong Xiangyin's manure pit often being without water were criticized. The next day, all three manure pits in the village that had no manure were transformed, and the Tribulus terrestris seedlings in Kong Qingshen's melon field were also weeded. After this in-depth inspection, the village's production was further advanced, and the cadres also had a deeper understanding that production must have leadership and were determined to implement the inspection system. The County Party Committee of the county issued a notice to the whole county, calling on them to learn the method of leading production in Qian Beifeng.

　　党员带头推动生产
  　前北峰支部受表扬
    【冀南电】元朝前北峰村支部全力领导、党员带头影响下，使全村生产向前推进一步。该村村干党员解决了生产“不用领导”的思想障碍后，积极领导群众锄草、积肥，准备秋收、种麦。支书孔凡行首先作出生产计划，争取种麦二十二亩，积肥二十七大车，另买六百斤菜籽饼作肥料。五亩棒子保证锄四遍。支委组织孔令显，计划种麦二十四亩，准备卖个大猪，再买点粪，解决十亩地的缺肥问题。民兵队长程很海计划到卫河西推菜籽，赚钱买粪。支部中每个人都作出计划，支委会又具体讨论了如何带领群众生产问题。随即召开扩大干部会和群众会，讲解党的奖励生产发家致富的生产政策，号召群众多锄地积肥，节约备荒。在支部全力领导和党员、干部积极带领下，全村展开了组与组人与人之间的生产竞赛，群众情绪极为热烈。为防止竞赛流于形式，全体村干又分街挨户挨地深入检查。发现程堂七亩春谷，锄的又深又没草，谷苗有四尺多高。孔凤菊十四岁，她的棒子锄了三遍，地里也没草。孔得兴组因农具不够使，三人两晚上在月下锄苗十六亩。对于这些模范事例，及时进行广播表扬，并对孔庆申瓜地里长满蒺莉、孔庆太年青力壮不劳动，程增粪坑闲着，地里草长老高也没锄，孔相银粪坑里经常无水等不积极生产的现象加以批评。第二天全村三个没粪的坑都变了样，孔庆申瓜地里的蒺莉秧也锄了。经过这次深入检查，该村生产又推进了一步，干部也更深刻认识到生产必须有领导，决心贯彻检查制度。该县县委会特通报全县，号召学习前北峰领导生产的方法。
