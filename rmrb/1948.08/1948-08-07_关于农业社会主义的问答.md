    Questions and Answers Regarding Agricultural Socialism

    Question: Chairman Mao said in his speech at the meeting of cadres in Jin Sui on April 1st: "The idea of destroying industry and commerce and advocating absolute egalitarianism in the distribution of land, which is now popular in the countryside, is an idea of agricultural socialism. This kind of thinking is reactionary, backward, and regressive. We should criticize this kind of thinking." What is the idea of agricultural socialism? Why is it reactionary?

    Answer: The idea of agricultural socialism that Chairman Mao is talking about here refers to a kind of egalitarian ideology that is produced on the basis of a small-peasant economy. People who hold this idea attempt to understand and transform the entire world with the standards of a small-peasant economy, believing that transforming the entire social economy into a unified "equal" small-peasant economy is to implement socialism and avoid the development of capitalism. In the past, utopian thinkers or practitioners of primitive socialism representing small producers in history, such as the Narodniks of the Tsarist era and the people of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in China, mostly held this kind of thinking.

    The egalitarianism based on the small-peasant economy has both revolutionary and reactionary qualities under certain historical conditions.

    From the perspective of peasants equally dividing the land and property of the feudal class, this is the revolutionary aspect, the correct aspect. Because the feudal land property relationship shackles and exploits peasants with feudalistic methods, hindering the development of social productive forces; the peasants equally dividing the land and property of the feudal class means turning the feudal land property into the land property of the direct agricultural producers—the peasants, giving the broad masses of peasants a foundation to improve their production conditions, enhancing their production enthusiasm, and creating certain conditions for the rapid development of industry. This is a great revolutionary movement that most thoroughly sweeps away the remnants of the feudal system. Because the peasants' anti-feudal egalitarianism has this revolutionary character, our Communist Party approves of and helps the peasants implement the equal division of the land and property of landlords and feudal rich peasants. But the peasants' egalitarianism only has its revolutionary character in the equal division of feudal land property, and we only approve of and help the peasants implement this kind of egalitarianism at this time. Apart from this situation, we cannot approve of or implement the peasants' egalitarianism. Moreover, the nature of this revolution of peasants equally dividing feudal land property is only an anti-feudal bourgeois-democratic revolution, not an anti-capitalist socialist revolution. It would be completely wrong and extremely harmful to misunderstand the peasant revolution of equally dividing feudal land property as implementing socialism or communism.

    The reactionary aspect, the erroneous aspect, of egalitarianism based on the small-peasant economy is that, subjectively, its thinking transcends the boundaries of this anti-feudalism, unwilling to be limited to the scope of equally dividing feudal and semi-feudal land property, and also wants to equally divide the land property of all other classes and all strata of peasants (such as middle peasants and new-style rich peasants) and all other people, and also wants to equally divide industry and commerce, and call this entire equal division "communism" or "socialism." This is absolute egalitarianism, this is reactionary, backward, and regressive. Because the result of such an equal division is not only to destroy feudal land property relations, but also to destroy non-feudal, i.e., free capitalist, property relations, that is, to destroy industry and commerce and the land and property of some middle peasants and new-style rich peasants in an egalitarian way, and thus also to strike at the upward enthusiasm of the broad masses of industrial and agricultural producers. In this way, not only will it not be possible to improve social productivity, but it will inevitably greatly reduce and regress social productivity. Because this kind of absolute egalitarianism subjectively hopes to restore the social economy that has developed and is developing in industry and agriculture (this development is capitalist in the current stage) to the isolated small-peasant social economy of the feudal era, and to restore the industry that has developed and is developing, and the commerce built on the basis of the development of industry and agriculture, to a self-sufficient natural economy. This is contrary to the development of social history, contrary to the development of social productive forces, and causes it to regress. Therefore, this kind of thinking and this kind of practice is reactionary, backward, and regressive.

    Land reform to equally divide feudal and semi-feudal land property is not the realization of socialism, it is not "communism." Because land reform only abolishes the private property of the feudal class, it does not abolish the private property of capitalism, and objectively it also clears the way for the broad development of capitalism. Because after land reform, economic competition in the countryside will inevitably have new developments, and will inevitably lead to new class differentiation among peasants, and it will never be possible to maintain an equal small-peasant economy forever. After the peasants have been divided the land, they exist as small private owners, and their production conditions cannot be completely equal, and especially cannot remain unchanged. Some peasants, because their production conditions are more favorable, and they work hard in production and are good at management, their economy may develop and gradually become wealthy, and a small number of them may engage in exploitation and become new rich peasants. And other peasants, because their production conditions are less favorable, or do not work hard in production, or are not good at management, or encounter certain irresistible blows, their economy cannot develop, and gradually become impoverished, and a part of them cannot but be exploited and become new poor peasants or hired laborers. This kind of competition and new class differentiation is inevitable in a new democratic society, and is allowed, and is not terrible. Because under certain historical conditions, only by allowing this kind of competition can the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants be mobilized and the agricultural economy be greatly developed; therefore, this kind of competition on the basis of private ownership has its certain progressiveness. People who hold the idea of agricultural socialism cannot see this possible social change after land reform, cannot see that the laws of commodity economy and capitalist development will still exist in a new democratic society, and think that it is possible to create equality or uniformity in the economy and life of all peasants in and after the anti-feudal land reform, and deny or oppose this kind of competition and differentiation, which results in hindering the development of productive forces and becoming a kind of reactionary utopia.

    The above-mentioned competition and differentiation, if it is in the social environment of old capitalism, can continue to differentiate due to the unrestricted development of free competition and capitalist monopoly, until the interests gained by the vast majority of peasants in land reform are nullified, as was the case with peasants in France and the United States long ago after land reform. There, land reform was led by the bourgeoisie and bourgeois political parties, not by the proletariat and proletarian political parties, so after land reform, a capitalist social system developed. As a result, there was fierce and unrestricted class differentiation in both rural and urban areas, on the one hand creating a small number of tycoons who monopolized the wealth of the country, and on the other hand turning the majority of the people into extreme poverty, becoming slaves of big capital. Therefore, merely implementing land reform, if not simultaneously implementing a series of new democratic economic policies under the leadership of the proletariat and its political party, and finally implementing a socialist system, the liberation of the majority of peasants is still impossible, and the poverty and bankruptcy of the majority of peasants is still inevitable. However, the land reform in China today will not lead to that result, because the land reform in China today is realized under the leadership of the proletariat and its leader, the Communist Party, and after it has been implemented, it will systematically implement new democratic economic policies, so everything gained by the majority of peasants in land reform, as long as they work hard in production and are good at management, may develop, and may not lose their land property again and become impoverished. Because in a new democratic country, free competition and class differentiation still exist, but they are not without restrictions, as has been the case in capitalist countries. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago in his "On New Democracy" that, due to the backwardness of China's economy, our new democratic economy must still allow the existence and development of capitalist production that "cannot manipulate the national economy and the people's livelihood," and in the countryside, it must allow the existence and development of new-style rich peasants; at the same time, it must never allow a small number of capitalists and a small number of landlords to "manipulate the national economy and the people's livelihood," and it must never establish a European and American-style capitalist society, let alone restore the old semi-feudal society. We must follow the path pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, on the one hand, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the new democratic government, based on the two principles of the peasants' voluntary participation (not forced orders and artificiality) and equivalent exchange (those who contribute more labor get more, those who contribute less labor get less), adopt certain steps and various possible forms that the peasant masses consider beneficial and reasonable and that can be naturally accepted by the masses, in order to develop cooperation in labor exchange on the basis of the individual economy (on the basis of private property) in the countryside, "in the movement of labor exchange cooperation, competition and contest should also be developed"; on the other hand, we must, through our new democratic government, provide financial investment and economic and technical assistance to the production of the broad masses of peasants, so that the majority of peasants who work hard in production, after being liberated from feudal oppression, can maintain the status of middle peasants, avoid bankruptcy due to the oppression of monopoly capitalists, and their lives will gradually improve. At the same time, our industry can use the vast labor force surplus from the development of labor exchange cooperation and the improvement of technology in the countryside to obtain a vast industrial reserve army. This industrial reserve army will also be different from the industrial reserve army in European and American capitalist countries, which is bankrupted or squeezed out due to capital oppression, and becomes an object of capital's free plunder. After land reform, we must take the new democratic road pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, and we must never take the road of capitalist countries. The leadership of the proletariat guarantees that we will take such a road. However, it must be known that to achieve this reasonable result of new democracy, it is not without difficulties and struggles, but there will inevitably be difficulties, and necessary struggles will inevitably be carried out, because there are still many capitalists and rich peasants who want to take the old capitalist road; therefore, we must rely on the correct and strong leadership of the Communist Party and the active efforts of the broad masses of the people in order to gradually overcome the resistance of old capitalism and various difficulties that may be encountered.

    However, even as mentioned above, in the old democratic countries, a certain degree of class differentiation among peasants after land reform is still inevitable, and the development of absolute egalitarianism in agriculture is still impossible.

    The Chinese working class leading the peasants and other people to carry out land reform and develop a new democratic economy is the first step in the liberation of the peasants. The Chinese working class leading the peasants and other people, after another stage of historical struggle, to realize socialism is the second step in the liberation of the peasants. Socialism cannot be built by relying on small production, but must rely on socialized large production, first of all, the large production of industry, to engage in construction. Only socialism can eliminate all poverty, can finally liberate the peasants, and can gradually eliminate classes. But if we want to reach socialism and realize socialist industry and agriculture, we must go through a period of development of the new democratic economy, and only after massively developing public and private modernized industries in the new democratic society, manufacturing a large number of agricultural machines for the peasants to use, and thus gradually transforming the peasants' individual economy into a collective farm economy, is it possible. Without the massive development of industry, without a large number of thousands of agricultural machines for the peasants to use, and without making it possible for the peasants to unite in collective farms, to implement socialist agriculture can only be a reactionary idea. People with agricultural socialist ideas want to achieve socialism on the basis of an isolated, single small-production economy by adopting absolute egalitarian methods, which is precisely such a reactionary idea. The result will not be socialist agriculture, but the destruction and regression of social productive forces. Of course, even in a socialist society, it is impossible to make all people completely uniform in their lives, which is also completely different from the reactionary views of agricultural socialists. The principle that can be realized in a socialist society (i.e., the first stage of communism) is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." Workers and peasants who produce more and better in labor will inevitably receive more remuneration, while those who produce less and worse will inevitably receive less remuneration. Socialist society never allows those who do not work to gain without labor, nor does it allow lazy people and active laborers to receive the same remuneration and enjoy the same treatment.

    Only after the long-term and high development of the socialist economy, and after the establishment of the communist system, that is, after the establishment of the social system of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need," can the equality of all people in society in life be realized.

    We Marxists regard history as the history of the development of production, the history of the productive people. To repeat, the equal division of feudal land property starts from the basic point of developing productive forces, in order to hand over the means of production occupied by the unproductive, parasitic, corrupt, and reactionary feudal class to the direct producers, in order to thoroughly destroy feudal relations of production and establish new democratic relations of production, so as to facilitate the large-scale development of social productive forces, and never for the sake of distribution for distribution's sake. Poor peasants and hired laborers who have been divided a certain amount of land property in the land reform must work hard in production thereafter, improve production technology, conduct production competitions, that is, rely on their own labor and the labor of mutual aid in labor exchange among the masses to improve their economic situation, and must not wait for any further distribution, or only place their hopes on the democratic government's relief and relief. It must be known that if we do not work hard in production and greatly develop productive forces, even if we adopt adventurous methods according to the reactionary utopia of agricultural socialism and distribute the land property of all classes and all strata in society according to the method of absolute equality, there is not much that can be eaten for a long time. The result will certainly still be everyone's poverty. Therefore, all Communist Party members must consolidate their view on the development of production, and in certain occasions in the land reform and after the land reform, must especially conduct education on the development of production for the poor peasants and hired laborers, and also conduct education on the development of production for the middle peasants and other people, and continue to implement necessary rewards for improving production. Especially after land reform, carrying out education on improving production and organizing production mutual aid organizations to ensure that the majority of peasants can produce and become rich, and can live a prosperous life, is the fundamental task of Communist Party members in the countryside. These education on improving production and activities for developing production must be used to eliminate the utopia of agricultural socialism, and thereby smoothly complete other work necessary for the current revolution.

### 关于农业社会主义的问答

    关于农业社会主义的问答
    问：毛主席四月一日在晋绥干部会议的讲话中说：“现在农村中流行的一种破坏工商业，在分配土地的问题上主张绝对平均主义的思想，是一种农业社会主义的思想。这种思想的性质是反动的，落后的，倒退的。我们应当批判这种思想”。农业社会主义思想是一种什么思想？它为什么是反动的？
    答：毛主席在这里所说的农业社会主义思想，是指在小农经济基础上产生出来的一种平均主义思想。抱有这种思想的人们，企图用小农经济的标准，来认识和改造全世界，以为把整个社会经济都改造为划一的“平均的”小农经济，就是实行社会主义，而可以避免资本主义的发展。过去历史上代表小生产者的原始社会主义的空想家或实行家，例如帝俄时代的民粹派和中国的太平天国的人们，大都是抱有这一类思想的。
    以小农经济为基础的平均主义思想，在一定的历史条件下，有革命的与反动的两种性质。
    从农民平分封建阶级的土地财产这方面来说，这是革命的方面，正确的方面。因为封建的土地财产关系，以封建主义的制法束缚农民、剥削农民，阻碍社会生产力的发展；农民平分了封建阶级的土地财产，就是把封建的土地财产变成农业直接生产者——农民的土地财产，使广大农民获得改善生产条件的基础，提高他们的生产积极性，并为工业的迅速发展创造了一定的条件。这是一种伟大的最彻底地扫除封建制度遗迹的革命运动。因为农民的反封建的平均主义有这种革命性，所以我们共产党赞成并帮助农民实行了平分地主及封建富农的土地财产。但农民的平均主义，仅仅在平分封建的土地财产上，有其革命性，我们也仅仅在这种时候才去赞成并帮助农民们实行这种平均主义。除开这种场合以外，农民的平均主义，我们都是不能赞成和实行的。而且农民这种平分封建土地财产的革命，其性质，也只是反对封建主义的资产阶级性质的民主革命，而并不是反对资本主义的社会主义性质的革命。如果把农民平分封建土地财产的革命，误解为是实行社会主义或共产主义，那也是完全错误的和极端有害的。
    以小农经济为基础的平均主义的反动方面、错误方面，就是它在主观上思想超越这个反封建主义的界限，不愿限制在平分封建与半封建的土地财产的范围以内，并且还要平分社会上其他一切阶级、农民一切阶层（例如中农和新式富农）和其他一切人等的土地财产，还要平分工商业，并把这种一切平分称为“共产”，或称为“社会主义”。这就是一种绝对平均主义，这就是反动的、落后的、倒退的。因为这样平均的结果，不独是要破坏封建的土地财产关系，而且要破坏非封建的即自由资本主义的财产关系，就是要平均主义地破坏工商业及一部分中农和新式富农的土地和财产，因而也要打击广大工业和农业生产者的向上积极性。这样，就不独不能提高社会生产力，而且必然要使社会生产力大大降低和后退。因为这种绝对平均主义主观地希望把那在工业上和农业上已发展了的、和正在发展（这种发展在目前阶段是资本主义性质的）的社会经济，还原为封建时代那种孤立的小农式的社会经济，把那已发展了的和正在发展的工业，以及建立在工业与农业的发展基础之上的商业，还原为自给自足的自然经济。这是违反社会历史的发展、违反社会生产力的发展，而使之后退的。所以这种想法和这种做法，乃是反动的、落后的、倒退的。
    平人封建半封建的土地财产的土地改革，并不是实现社会主义，并不是“共产”。因为土地改革只是废除封建阶级的私有财产，没有废除资本主义的私有财产，并在客观上还为资本主义的广大发展扫清道路。因为在土地改革之后，农村中的经济竞争，不可避免地曾有新的发展，并使农民之间不可避免地会有新的阶级分化，而绝不能永远保持平均的小农经济。农民在分得土地后，是作为小的私有主而存在的，他们的生产条件不可能完全相等，尤其不可能保持不变。有些农民，因为生产条件比较有利，又努力生产，善于经营，他们的经济就可能发展，而逐渐地富裕起来，其中有小部分就有可能进行剥削，而成为新的富农。而另外有些农民，因为生产条件比较不利，或者不努力生产，或者不善于经营，或者遇到某些不可抗拒的打击，他们的经济就不能发展，而逐渐地穷困下来，其中有一部分就不能不受人剥削而变为新的贫农或雇农。这种竞争与新的阶级分化，即在新民主主义的社会里，也是不可避免的，而且是被允许的，不是可怕的。因为在一定的历史条件之下，只有允许这种竞争，才能发动广大农民的生产积极性，把农业经济广大地发展起来；所以这种私有经济基础上的竞争，有其一定的进步性。抱有农业社会主义思想的人们，看不见土地改革后这种可能的社会变化，看不见这种商品经济与资本主义发展的规律在新民主主义社会中仍将存在，而以为可以在反封建的土地改革中及土地改革后，就能够造成全体农民在经济上与生活上的平等或划一，否认或者反对这种竞争和分化，结果就是阻碍生产力的发展，而成为一种反动的空想。
    上述那种竞争和分化，如果是在旧资本主义的社会环境中，那可以因为自由竞争与资本主义垄断的无限制的发展，而一直分化下去，以至太多数农民在土地改革中所得的利益，化为乌有，例如很久以前法国与美国在土地改革后的农民那样。在那里，土地改革是由资产阶级及资产阶级政党领导的，不是由无产阶级及无产阶级政党领导的，所以，在土地改革后发展了资本主义的社会制度。其结果，农村和城市都有激烈的无限制的阶级分化，一方面造成了垄断全国财富的少数大富翁，另一方面，把大多数人民变成极端贫困，变成了大资本的奴隶。所以仅仅实行土地改革，如果不同时实行在无产阶级及其政党领导之下的一系列的新民主主义的经济政策，并在最后实行社会主义的制度，大多数农民的解放还是不可能的，大多数农民的贫困与破产，还是不可避免的。然而，在我们中国今天的土地改革，不会走到那种结果，因为中国今天的土地改革是在无产阶级及其领袖共产党领导之下实现的，并且已经实行以后还要系统地实行新民主主义的经济政策，所以大多数农民在土地改革中所得的一切，只要自己努力生产与善于经营，就有可能发展起来，就有可能不至重新丧失自己的土地财产而穷困下来。因为在新民主主义的国家内，自由竞争与阶级分化虽是仍然存在，但不是没有限制的，如资本主义各国所已有过的那样。毛泽东同志在其新民主主义论中早已指出，由于中国经济的落后性，我们的新民主主义经济还必须容许“不能操纵国民生计”的资本主义生产的存在和发展，在农村中则须容许新式富农的存在和发展；同时，决不能让少数资本家少数地主“操纵国民生计”，绝不能建立欧美式的资本主义社会，更不能恢复旧的半封建社会。我们经过毛泽东同志指出的这种道路，一方面，要在共产党与新民主主义政府的领导之下，根据农民自愿（不是强迫命令和矫揉造作）与等价（出劳动多的得多，出劳动少的得少）的两个原则，采取那种为农民群众认为有利与合理、能为群众自然而然地接受的一定步骤与各种可能形式，以发展农村中在个体经济基础上（私有财产基础上）的变工合作，“在变工合作运动中，同样地要发展竞争与竞赛”；另方面，要经过我们新民主主义政府对于广大农民生产给以财政投资及经济和技术的援助，这样就使大多数努力生产的农民在从封建的压迫解放出来之后，可能保持中农的地位，避免因受垄断资本家的压迫而重新陷于破产，并且会使他们的生活步步向上。同时，我们的工业则可以利用农村因发展变工合作及提高技术而过剩出来的广大劳动力，获得广大的工业后备军。这种工业后备军，也就会和欧美资本主义国家那种因资本压迫、而破产出来或被排挤出来、并更成为资本自由掠夺的对象的工业后备军，有所区别。我们在土地改革后，一定要走上毛泽东同志所指出的这种新民主主义的道路，而决不能走资本主义国家的道路。无产阶级的领导，保证我们走这样道路。但是，必须知道：要达到这种新民主主义的合理结果，决不是没有困难没有斗争的，而是一定会有困难，一定会要进行必要的斗争，因为还有不少的资本家和富农要走旧资本主义的道路；因此，一定要依靠共产党的正确而坚强的领导与广大人民群众的积极努力，才可能步步克服旧资本主义的抵抗及可能遇到的各种困难。
    然而，即使如上所说，在旧民主主义的国家内，土地改革后农民中一定程度的阶级分化，仍然是不可避免的，农业上绝对平均主义的发展，仍然是不可能的。
    中国工人阶级领导农民与其他人民，进行土地改革，发展新民主主义经济，这是农民解放的第一步。中国工人阶级领导农民与其他人民，经过另一个阶段的历史斗争，实现社会主义，这是农民解放的第二步。社会主义不是依靠小生产可以建设起来的，而是必须依靠社会化的大生产，首先是工业的大生产来从事建设。只有社会主义才可能消灭一切的贫困，才可能最后来解放农民，才可能使阶级逐步归于消灭。但我们要达到社会主义，实现社会主义的工业和农业，必须经过新民主主义经济一个时期的发展，在新民主主义社会中大量地发展公私近代化工业，制造大批供给农民使用的农业机器，并因此将农民的个体经济逐步的转变为集体农场经济之后，才有可能。没有工业的大量发展，没有大量的成千成万的农业机器供给农民使用，并使农民有可能团结于集体农场之中，而要实行社会主义的农业，那只能是反动的思想。带有农业社会主义思想的人们，想在孤立的单个小生产经济的基础上，采取绝对平均主义的办法，来企图实现社会主义，就正是这样一种反动的思想。其结果，决不是什么社会主义的农业，而将是社会生产力的破坏与倒退。当然，即使在社会主义社会，也不能使所有的人在生活上的完全划一，也和农业社会主义者的反动观点完全不同。在社会主义社会（即共产主义的第一阶段）所能实现的原则，乃是“各尽所能，各取所值”。在劳动中生产得更多更好的工人与农民，他们取得的报酬就必定较多，而生产得较差的，所得的报酬就一定较少。社会主义社会决不容许不劳而获，也决不容许偷懒的人与积极劳动的人取得同样的报酬与享受同样的待遇。
    只有经过长期的社会主义经济的高度的发展，并使共产主义的制度得以建立起来之后，就是在建立了“各尽所能，各取所需”的社会制度之后，社会上一切人们生活上的平等，才可能实现。
    我们马克思主义者把历史看成是生产发展的历史，是生产人民的历史。重复地说，平分封建的土地财产是从发展生产力量这一个基本点出发的，是为的把不事生产的、寄生的、腐朽的、反动的封建阶级所霸占的生产条件交给直接生产者，是为的彻底破坏封建的生产关系，建立新民主主义的生产关系，以利社会生产力的广大的发展，而绝不是为分配而分配。在土地改革中分得一定份量的土地财产的贫农与雇农，此后必须努力生产，改善生产技术，进行生产的竞赛，即依靠自己以及群众间变工互助的劳动，以提高自己的经济情况，决不能还等待什么分配又分配，或只把希望寄托于民主政府的救济又救济。必须知道，如果不努力生产，广大的发展生产力，即使按照农业社会主义的反动空想，采取冒险办法，而把社会上一切阶级一切阶层的土地财产按绝对平均的方法分配了，那也是没有多少东西可以长期吃用的。所得的结果，一定仍然是大家的一场贫困。所以，一切共产党员必须巩固自己关于发展生产的观点，而在土地改革中的一定场合以及土地改革之后，必须特别对于贫农和雇农，认真的进行发展生产的教育，同时也对于中农及其他人们进行发展生产的教育，并继续实行对于提高生产的必要奖励。特别在土地改革之后，进行提高生产的教育，与进行生产互助组织，以保障大多数农民都能生产发家，都能过富裕生活，乃是共产党员在农村中的根本任务。必须用这些提高生产的教育和发展生产的活动，以扫除农业社会主义的空想，并由此得以顺利地完成其他为当前革命所必需的工作。
