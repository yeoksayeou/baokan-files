Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: According to people from Kaifeng, as a result of the correct implementation of urban policies during the PLA's liberation of Kaifeng, people from all walks of life in Kaifeng now deeply miss our army. Seeing the Kuomintang army's random arrests and looting after entering the city, everyone shook their heads and sighed, "That's better than those people (referring to the PLA) being here!?" This has become the most popular saying in Kaifeng now. In order to salvage the completely lost popular support in Kaifeng, the Kuomintang government sent the pseudo-Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang and the pseudo-Vice Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun to Kaifeng to talk about "relief." At the banquet to welcome Gu and others, the pseudo-Provincial Speaker Liu Jixue complained, "Kaifeng's fall this time caused the government to lose many things, all of which are regrettable; the most regrettable thing is the loss of popular support. If the President wants to come up with a solution, what kind of President is he if he can't come up with a solution? If you can't beat them, don't fight. If you can't beat them and you use planes to bomb the people to death, I don't know what kind of idea that is? Official statistics say that more than 20,000 houses were damaged and less than 2,000 people died. Who believes this number? After turning Kaifeng into this, what's the use of sending people to provide relief now?" According to a Kaifeng dispatch published in the Tianjin Yishibao on July 11th, Liu's speech was interrupted by applause from time to time. "Minister Gu only shook his head and smiled bitterly, sitting on pins and needles, waving his small fan non-stop." The anti-communist author of the dispatch declared in horror that our army "bewitched" many people. "The general public still shakes their heads in amazement when they mention the bombing policy of the Huanghai Air Force. People with unclear minds have even become voluntary propagandists for the communist 'bandits', which is a very serious problem." At this point, the dispatch exclaimed, "The communist 'bandits' will completely lure away the hearts of the people in the Central Plains."

When the PLA was in Kaifeng, shops and theaters were open as usual. However, on June 26th, as soon as the Kuomintang army entered the city, order was disrupted, and shops closed down. The Kuomintang authorities threatened that if they did not resume business quickly, they would recover old debts. The theaters did not reopen until July 11th. The first thing the pseudo-Kaifeng County Government did after resuming office was to apportion funds, with soldiers taking notes to various shops to carry out armed collection, ranging from 10 million yuan for small businesses to more than 50 million yuan for large ones. The apportionment in the rural areas of the eastern suburbs was even greater, and the collection of grain was as urgent as a fire. When the enemy's Fifth Army passed through, they caught chickens and pigs, and rape occurred not far from the city. The following ballad circulated among the people: "People of Kaifeng, so miserable, gone are the 68th, here come the 55th (referring to the Kuomintang army Liu Ruzhen's 68th Division and Cao Fulin's 55th Division). Qiu Qingquan, the Fifth Army, is not even as good as the 55th." The so-called "relief," the Kuomintang Propaganda Minister Li Weiguo claimed in Nanjing was 400 billion yuan, while Gu and others claimed in Kaifeng that it was only 80 billion yuan. However, the people of Kaifeng did not see a single cent. As a result, even the most reactionary Lixing Daily complained, "The big shots flew around wasting a lot of gasoline, but the people didn't see a single cent. Kaifeng says 80 billion, Nanjing says 400 billion, how much is it exactly? You might as well sneak back secretly!"

    开封人民怀念解放军
    我军正确执行城市政策获各阶层赞扬
    蒋匪狂暴轰炸乱抓乱抢完全失去民心
    【新华社中原六日电】据开封来人谈：解放军解放开封期间，由于正确执行了城市政策的结果，现开封各阶层人士对我军均不胜思念。他们见国民党军入城后的乱抓、乱抢，无不摇头感叹：“那比人家（指解放军）在这里！？”这已成为开封现在最流行的一句话。国民党政府为挽救其完全丧失了的开封民心，派了伪社会部长谷正纲、伪国防部次长秦德纯等到开封大谈“救济”。在欢宴谷等的会上，伪省议长刘积学大发牢骚地说：“开封这次失守，政府丢东西很多，都很可惜；最可惜的是丢了民心。当大总统就要拿出办法来，拿不出办法还当什么大总统？打不过人家就不要打，打不过人家，要用飞机把老百姓炸光，不知是什么主意？官方统计损毁两万多间房子，死的不到两千，谁信这个数字？把开封弄成这个样子，现在派人来救济有什么用？”另据天津益世报七月十一日所载开封通讯称：刘氏的演讲不时为拍拍的掌声所打断，“谷部长只摇头苦笑，如坐针毡，小扇挥个不停”。该通讯的反共作者惶恐地宣称，我军“‘迷惑’了不少人心。一般市民对黄海机群的轰炸政策，至今提起还是摇头咋舌。头脑不清分子竟然作了共‘匪’的义务宣传员，这实在是非常严重的问题。”至此，该通讯惊呼：“共‘匪’将会整个诱走了我们中原的民心。”
    解放军在开封时，商店、戏院均照常营业。而六月廿六日国民党军一进城即秩序大乱，商店关门。国民党当局则以如不迅速复业就要追缴钱款旧欠来威胁。戏院直到七月十一日才复业。伪开封县府恢复办公后第一件事就是派款，由士兵拿上条子到各商店实行武装征收，少者一千万元，多者五千万元以上。东郊农村摊派更多，催粮急如星火。敌整五军过境时更是捕鸡捉猪，离城不远就发生强奸。民间流传着下述歌谣：“开封人，好命苦，去了六十八，来了五十五（指国民党军刘汝珍部六八师与曹福林部五五师）。邱清泉，第五军，连五十五都不如。”所谓“救济”，国民党宣传部长李维果在南京宣传的是四千亿元，而谷等到开封时却声称只有八百亿。但开封老百姓却分文未见。以致开封最反动的力行日报也发牢骚说：“大员们飞来飞去浪费了很多汽油，老百姓却分文未见。开封说八百亿，南京说四千亿，到底是多少？你们还不如偷偷摸摸回去吧！”
