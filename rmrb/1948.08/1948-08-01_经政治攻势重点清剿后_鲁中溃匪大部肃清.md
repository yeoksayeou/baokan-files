Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th. The scattered remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary armed forces from Weixian, Changle, Anqiu, and along the Jinpu Railway have been largely eliminated under the political offensives and focused military suppression by our military and civilians in central Shandong during May and June. According to incomplete statistics, from early May to mid-June, a total of 5,363 enemy soldiers surrendered to us or were killed, wounded, or captured in the suppression battles. We seized 29 artillery pieces of various types, 127 light and heavy machine guns, 2,880 rifles, 420 pistols, and more than 40 carbines, Thompson submachine guns, and over 140,000 rounds of ammunition. Among them, the entire battalion of the 10th Regiment of the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Security Force, a part of Sun Rongdi's troops, and Zhuang Wenya's bandit troops in the Mengshan area were annihilated as a whole. The 2nd Brigade of the Weixian Joint Defense, led by Brigade Commander Niu Wenqing, with 270 men, and more than ten groups including Liu Zhongtang and Gong Ziying surrendered as a whole.
