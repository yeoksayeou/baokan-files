Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd. Comprehensive reports from Tianjin newspapers: After creating the "July 5th Massacre," executioner Fu Zuoyi has directed his military police and secret agents to continue persecuting students from Northeast China in Beiping. On the morning of the 9th of this month, seven students from Northeast China were arrested near the Red Building of Peking University, and more than 20 students living in various hotels were also arrested. On the morning of the 8th, when more than 100 students from Northeast China went to the Yidi in the western suburbs to pay tribute to their deceased classmates, they were surrounded and dispersed by military police. The hospital where the injured students were staying was not opened for visitation until the 12th. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on the 13th, an investigation of injured students residing in four hospitals revealed that 18 of them "will need at least five or six months before they can be discharged." The five seriously injured students hospitalized in Beiping "cried and groaned all night because they were all hit by American-made special bullets." The newspaper revealed in its editorial on the 10th that, due to the military police "using machine guns to sweep, one student had as many as twelve bullets in his right leg."

Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd. Comprehensive reports from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: The bloody crime of the Kuomintang reactionary clique's "July 5th" massacre of students from Northeast China in Beiping continues to arouse the indignation of young students and professors in various parts of the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and the just struggle of students from Northeast China against persecution and hunger has gained widespread support. The "July 5th Massacre Support Association," formed by students from four universities in Tianjin, including Nankai and Beiyang, held a condemnation and memorial meeting at Beiyang University on the afternoon of July 9th, and sent telegrams to the All-China Student Federation and the International Student Federation requesting support. In addition to sending representatives to Beiping to express condolences to the injured students, the association has launched a widespread fundraising campaign in various schools. By the 9th, donations from Beiyang University alone had exceeded 100 million yuan in Chiang currency (according to Yishibao figures). On the 11th, faculty and staff from Northeast China at Beiyang University jointly issued a statement supporting the just demands of students from Northeast China. In Tangshan, students remaining at Tangshan Institute of Technology during the summer also formed a support association, raising 10 million yuan to send to students from Northeast China, and observed a vegetarian day on the 9th to express their condolences. Various universities in Beiping launched a fundraising campaign starting on the 8th. Students at Peking University initiated a flour donation campaign, donating their 15-jin ration tickets for the month of July to students from Northeast China. Students from Peking University Medical College and Shenyang Medical College in Beiping formed medical teams to serve the injured students. Hospitals in Beiping were filled with people visiting and expressing condolences to the injured students throughout the day. On the 12th alone, 47 schools and social organizations visited. The Student Union of Shanghai Jiaotong University sent a telegram to the Northeast Students' Association on the 8th to express condolences to the victims and to express support for their just struggle.
