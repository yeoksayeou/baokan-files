    [Jinan News] Some villages in Yuancheng, Weixian, and Linzhang are seizing the favorable season of summer to actively create fertilizer. The masses in Zhongda Jiang and Xida Jiang in Yuancheng have launched a fertilizer-making upsurge. Most of the masses have piled soil next to their manure pits, and the water in the manure pits is constantly replenished. The masses in Xida Jiang, lacking enough sandy soil to haul, are digging out the mud from the bottom of the pits to compost manure. Li Qinghai's family alone has hauled fifteen large cartloads. Wang Lao Xia, a middle peasant in Nanli Village, Weixian County, has planned to compost fifty large cartloads of manure throughout the year, including fifteen cartloads of manure from half a cow; thirty-three cartloads of soil fertilizer for his eleven mu of autumn land, and one thousand six hundred jin of night soil; the remainder will be applied to the wheat fields. He is now actively composting manure. Under his influence, the whole village is actively composting manure. Since the wheat harvest, the whole village has added thirty-six new manure pits. Xu Lao, who helped with the wheat harvest, has already composted twenty large cartloads. Wang Shouzhi, a new middle peasant in Ximafang, Second District, has been paying attention to composting manure for the past four or five years. His crops grow well and yield more every year. His method of composting manure is: in the summer, he collects green grass, rotten leaves, rotten melon rinds, wheat bran soil, sweeping soil, and other things that can be composted and puts them into the manure pit. When it's hot, he waters it frequently and feeds a pig. In order to compost it quickly and strongly, when the contents of the manure pit change color, he adds one or two baskets of night soil. Chen Mingchuan in Rongdong, Shiligou Village, Sixth District, Linzhang, labors and produces himself, without relying on village substitute farming. From last winter to March this year, he accumulated eleven large cartloads of cattle manure, which he applied to the fields before sowing. His three mu of cotton and eight mu of sorghum are growing better than anyone else's. He now plans to accumulate seven large cartloads of fertilizer before planting wheat, ensuring that each mu of wheat land receives plenty of fertilizer.

    元朝等地群众积肥
    青草烂叶烂瓜皮
    搜罗放到粪坑里
    【冀南讯】元朝、威县、临漳有些村庄，抓紧夏季有利时节积极造肥。元朝中、西大江群众掀起造肥热潮，大多数群众粪坑边上都推满了土，粪坑里的水经常不断。西大江群众因沙土不够推，把坑底下的泥淘出来沤粪。李清海一家就推了十五大车。威县南里村中农王老霞订计划全年沤粪五十大车，半个牛积粪十五车；十一亩秋地上土粪三十三车，大粪一千六百斤；下余的都上到麦地里。他现在正积极沤粪。在他影响下，全村都积极沤起粪来。从麦收到现在，全村已增加新粪坑三十六个。许老掮麦收麦已沤好二十大车。二区西马坊新中农王守志，近四、五年都注意沤粪，每年庄稼长的好，收的多。他沤粪的办法是：在夏天把青草、烂叶、烂瓜西瓜皮、麦糠土，扫地土等能沤粪的东西都弄到粪坑里，天热了多浇水，喂上个猪。为了沤的又快又壮，粪坑里的东西变了色时，弄一两筐大粪倒进去。临漳六区十里垢村荣东陈明川，自己劳动生产，不用村中代耕。他去年冬天到今春三月间，积了十一大车牛粪，播种前都上到地里了，他三亩棉花、八亩高粱长的比谁的也好。现在又计划在种麦前积肥七大车，保证每亩麦地都多上粪。
