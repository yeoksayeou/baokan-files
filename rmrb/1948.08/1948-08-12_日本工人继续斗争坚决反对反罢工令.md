Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Japanese government, "based on MacArthur's orders, formally announced the immediately effective anti-strike ordinance on the evening of July 31st; this ordinance will be implemented until the parliament passes legislation to amend the current labor law in September. The anti-strike order stipulates that 'employees of national government agencies or local public entities are prohibited from collective bargaining or striking,' and 'workers in public enterprises are prohibited from striking, engaging in slowdowns, or employing slow work tactics,' violators will be 'subject to imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of up to 5,000 yen'" (Agence France-Presse). The day before the anti-strike order was issued, the Japanese Communist Party published a declaration in the Akahata newspaper, calling on the working class to rise up to "defend the independence of the motherland and defend democracy," demanding the resignation of the "fascist Ashida Cabinet" and the dissolution of parliament (Agence France-Presse). The Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, with three million members, issued a notice to its members to "continue the struggle for wage increases, prepare to participate in strikes, mass rallies, and demonstrations to protest the government's reactionary actions, and demand the immediate resignation of the Ashida Cabinet and the immediate dissolution of parliament" (TASS). The National Government Communications Workers' Union, with 370,000 members, has rejected the "cautious approach" warning issued by Minister of Communications Eiji Tomiyoshi and issued a statement firmly opposing the anti-strike order. The union's chairman, Kazuyoshi Tsuchibashi, announced on the 1st that workers would proceed with the August 7th strike plan despite the anti-strike order (Reuters). Previously, Tsuchibashi stated that Japanese workers must rise up and fight to prevent the revival of fascism in Japan. The National Railway Workers' Union, with 600,000 members, announced that it would fight alongside the communications workers and demand wage increases regardless of the anti-strike order. On the morning of the same day that the anti-strike order was issued, Tsuruoka Shinzo, Secretary-General of the Liaison Committee of Government Employees' and Municipal Employees' Unions, submitted a protest letter to MacArthur Headquarters, pointing out that the rights to collective bargaining and strike were originally guaranteed by the Constitution and the Far Eastern Commission's principles for Japanese trade union activities, and sharply questioned whether MacArthur Headquarters' letter had rescinded the basic principles of democracy? Does the Japanese government's attempt to deprive trade unions of their basic rights bring the danger of the revival of fascism and militarism?

　　日本工人继续斗争坚决反对反罢工令
    【新华社陕北八日电】各方报导：日本政府“以麦克阿瑟的命令为基幢，于七月三十一日晚正式公布立即生效的反罢工法令；该法令将实施到九月间议会通过修改现行劳工法的立法时为止。反罢工令规定：“全国政府机关或地方公共机关职员不得集体议价或罢工”，“禁止公共企业工人罢工、怠工或运用缓慢工作的策略”，违者“处以一年以下的劳役或五千元以下的罚金”（法新社）。在反罢工令发布的前一天，日本共产党在亦旗报上发表宣言，号召工人阶级起来“保卫祖国的独立和保卫民主”，要求“法西斯的芦田内阁”辞职和解散议会（法新社）。拥有三百万会员的产业劳动组合联合会通令会员“继续要求增资的斗争，准备参加抗议政府反动行动的罢工、群众大会和示威，要求芦田内阁立即辞职和立即解散议会”（塔斯社）。拥有三十七万会员的国营递信（按即交通）工人工会已拒斥递信相富吉荣二所作的“谨慎从事”的警告，并发表坚决反对反罢工令的声明。该工会主席土桥一吉于一日宣布：工人将不顾反罢工令而推行八月七日的罢工计划（路透社）。前此，土桥声称：日本工人必须起而战斗，以阻止法西斯主义在日本的复活。拥有六十万会员的国营铁道工人工会宣布将会同递信工人作战，将不顾反罢工令而要求增资。在反罢工令发布的同日晨，政府职工及市政职工工会联络委员会总书记鹤冈信三向麦克阿瑟总部提出抗议书，指出集体议价和罢工的权利原应受宪法和远东委员会之日本工会活动原则的保障，并尖锐地质问：麦克阿瑟总部的信是否取消了民主的基本原则？日本政府试图剥夺工会的基本权利是否带来法西斯主义及军国主义复活的危险？
