    Jinzhong Communication

    The rural areas of the Jinzhong Plain, once known for their wealth, have been turned into a living hell under the brutal rule of the Yan bandits. Luo Town in Fenyang, originally a large town with more than 700 households, now has only 200 households left. People are dying in large numbers from cold and starvation. According to extremely incomplete statistics from 34 villages in Fenyang, at least 400 people died from cold and starvation last winter and this spring. There are very few draught cattle left in the entire Jinzhong area. Large amounts of land are being left uncultivated. Even the Yan bandits' officials have to admit to this tragic situation. At a pseudo-Taiyuan City Council meeting on January 11 this year, a certain councilor said: "Today, nine-tenths of the fields in the countryside are lying fallow. The people are busy with corvée labor and lack cattle, farming tools, and seeds. Only one-thirtieth of the wheat has been planted, and most of the land has not been plowed." Another councilor said: "The disasters and suffering that the countryside is experiencing today are rarely seen in history. The common people simply cannot figure out how much they have to bear."
    The Yan bandits' more vicious method of plundering the people of Jinzhong is the so-called "integration of soldiers and farmers." The method is to organize men aged 16 to 48 in the village into groups of three, each sharing a portion of land (ranging from 30 to 60 mu per portion). One of them is a regular soldier, detached from production, and the other two are "national soldiers" and "self-defense forces," who farm at home. In Liang Village, Qi County, each portion of land is 32 mu, and each year they have to pay four taels of grain silver. The Yan bandits stipulate that each tael of grain silver is equivalent to three shi, seven dou, and five sheng of wheat. Thus, each person has to produce 15 shi for each portion of land. In addition, they have to give 7.5 shi to the regular soldier. Women, children, and old men over 48 are not allocated land at all. In Yuantai Gou, a village of more than 60 households in Qi County, half of them have no land. As a result, many people have no land to cultivate, and those who get "portions of land" are unable to cultivate them, so large amounts of land are left uncultivated, with grass growing three to four feet high. A local folk song goes: "The integration of soldiers and farmers is a treasure pot (the Yan bandits' self-praise), but gathering and gathering, there is no one left." For example, a peasant family of four in Xiyangcheng Village, Fenyang, was allocated one portion of land totaling 57 mu under the Yan bandits' "integration of soldiers and farmers" tyranny, and had to bear four taels, four mace, and seven fen of grain silver. Each tael of grain silver has to pay a total of three shi, five dou, and two sheng of regular grain (all calculated in wheat), provincial public grain, county public grain, and substitute purchase grain, which means that four taels, four mace, and seven fen of grain silver must bear more than fifteen shi and seven dou and three sheng. However, this peasant family harvested only ten shi of wheat last summer, and the entire income was not enough to pay the burden. The peasants' burden is not only grain, but also livestock, which they cannot afford to raise. Raising a mule or horse costs two shi of wheat per year, cattle and donkeys cost one shi per year, and pigs and sheep cost three dou per year.
    "You can't squeeze oil out of buckwheat husks," and when the Yan bandits could no longer extract the assigned burden items from the peasants, they resorted to open robbery. First, it was the marginal areas, where the Yan bandits implemented a "three-all policy," and then it was the heartland of their rule. After the summer harvest last year, the Yan bandits gathered 27 regiments of troops and brutally robbed grain in the area between Fenyang, Wenshui, Pingyao, and Jiexiu counties for more than a month, sweeping away grain, livestock, and furniture.
    The Yan bandits are increasing the construction of bunkers and fortifications in various cities and strongholds in Jinzhong every day, especially within the so-called "hundred-li defense line" centered on Taiyuan, where thousands and tens of thousands of peasants are being escorted to perform hard labor every day. A folk song is circulating among the people of Jinzhong: "Moving stones on the river beach, grinding fingers to a pulp, carrying bricks on the head, falling down and getting beaten (that is, being beaten)." Two months before this Jinzhong campaign, when spring plowing was in full swing, the Yan bandits in Pingyao, Jiexiu, Fenyang, Xiaoyi and other counties had to send four or five thousand laborers every day to Jiexiu to quarry stones and transport them to Taiyuan. There were very few young men left, and most of the laborers were old people, women and children, so that some pregnant women gave birth in the piles of rocks. The Yan bandits did not provide meals for the laborers, and the laborers had no dry food to bring because their food had been scraped clean, and some even starved to death on the way. However, the Yan bandits were still worried that his tortoise shell was not safe. On April 15 this year, Yan Xishan told his subordinates: "In the thirty-sixth year, I felt that the工事(fortifications) made in the thirty-fifth year were not enough, and this year I still feel that the 工事(fortifications)made last year were not enough." Therefore, the Yan bandits had to continue to build 1,200 more bunkers near Taiyuan, costing a total of 211 billion yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency, with 320,000 man-days of labor. This burden, of course, also falls on the people in the Yan bandit controlled areas of Jinzhong. As for the Yan bandits' massive conscription in Jinzhong, the large-scale escape of young and middle-aged men in the countryside, forcing many rural women to hang themselves or jump into wells, it is even more common.
    When the people of Jinzhong are forced to resist the Yan bandits' oppression, enslavement, and massacre, the Yan Xishan gang's method is to carry out massacres that are more ferocious than the Japanese invaders. In the late summer and autumn of last year, the Yan bandits staged an unprecedentedly brutal massacre in the vast area of the Jinzhong Plain. In the vicinity of Xiaqu Town in Wenshui alone, they killed more than 100 people, injured 2,000 people, and arrested 3,000 people. When the masses fled into the fields, the Yan bandits opened machine guns and strafed the fields. Women aged twelve to fifty were raped. In Jigu Village, the Yan bandits set fire to houses while raping women. Women who refused to be humiliated were thrown into the fire and burned alive. On March 9 this year, two regiments of the Yan bandits' 70th Division in Fenyang arrived at Shangjin Village. The masses fled, and only thirty-four men, women, old and young who had not had time to escape were hiding in a cave behind the village. The Yan bandits viciously piled firewood at the entrance of the cave and set it on fire. The raging flames poured into the entrance of the cave, and more than thirty people were all burned to death.
    The Yan bandits are murderous by nature, and he does not hide it at all. The Yan bandits' document "Current Work Instructions in Wenshui County" captured by our army begins with the sentence "Today is the era of killing!" What follows is a killing article: "Kill those who see the National Army fleeing, kill those who resist national obligations, kill those who are driven by bandits (Yan bandits' slander against us, the same below - editor), kill those who have contact with bandits, kill those who do not report the arrival of bandits, kill those who report incorrectly." Even the families of the People's Liberation Army should be "killed their entire family." It also said: "Rather kill one person wrongly than let one person go." On another captured document, "beating to death with乱棍(random sticks)" was explicitly stipulated as a criminal punishment, and the entire article said a dozen "beating to death with 乱棍(random sticks)" in a row. The "Instructions on Purging Pseudo-Elements" issued by the Yan bandits on January 31 this year stated: "Recently, I feel that the more pseudo-elements are purged, the more there are, which proves that the Communist Party is making persistent efforts and is not afraid of sacrifice. Our cadres are very fragile in their hearts and do not have enough internal strength to kill people. Our failure lies in the fact that we do not have people who can kill people."
    In order to kill people, Yan Xishan launched an unprecedented killing movement, the so-called "self-confession and rebirth movement." According to incomplete statistics, more than 400 people died in this movement in Pingyao, more than 300 people in Yangqu, more than 200 people in Wenshui, and 93 people in Xugou. The number of deaths in other counties is incalculable.
    The people of Jinzhong could not bear the Yan bandits' oppression, enslavement, and massacre, and a large number fled to the liberated areas. Last summer, 30,000 people fled from the plains of Fenyang and Wenshui to the liberated areas. In Baiyatou, Wuke, Xiaota and other villages in Yangqu, even entire villages moved to the liberated areas. The people who remained in Jinzhong were looking forward to the People's Liberation Army every day: "If our troops don't come again, we will all die!" When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived in the plains, many old ladies and old men grabbed the soldiers and knelt down, crying sadly: "Comrades, save us! I will give you this old life!"

    阎锡山残暴统治下的晋中农村
    晋中通讯
    素称富足的晋中平原农村，在阎匪残暴统治下，已变成人间地狱。汾阳罗城镇原是七百多户的大镇，现在已只剩二百户。人民因冻饿大批死亡。据汾阳三十四村极不完全的统计，去冬今春因冻饿而死者至少在四百人以上。整个晋中耕牛所存无几。大量土地被荒芜着。这种惨象就连阎匪官方也不得不承认。今年一月十一日伪太原市参议会上，某参议员说：“今日农村中十分之九的田亩在荒着，百姓因差役忙，缺乏牛和耕具、种子，麦仅种三十分之一，大半地没有翻耕。”另一个参议员说：“农村今日所受灾难与痛苦，为有史以来所少见，老百姓就说不清他负担几何。”
    阎匪掠夺晋中人民更毒辣的手段是实行所谓“兵农合一”。办法是将村中十六至四十八岁的男人都编成三人小组，每人分一份土地（每份卅至六十亩不等）。其中一人为常备兵，脱离生产，两人为“国民兵”与“自卫军”，在家种地。祁县梁村每份地是三十二亩，每年要出四两粮银，每两粮银阎匪规定出三石七斗五升麦子。这样，每人每份地就得出十五石。另外还得给常备兵七石五。妇女儿童与四十八岁以上的老汉根本不分土地。祁县元台沟一村六十多户，即有二分之一没有土地。结果许多人没有地种，得了“份地”的，也无力耕种，因此大量土地荒芜，草长三四尺。当地流行一个民谣叫做“兵农合一聚宝盆（阎匪自我赞颂），聚来聚去没有人”。又如汾阳西阳城村一个农民家庭，四口人，在阎匪“兵农合一”的暴政下，分到土地一份，共五十七亩，负担粮银四两四钱七分。每两粮银纳正粮（均以小麦计算）、省公粮、县公粮、代购粮共三石五斗二升，四两四钱七分粮银即须负担十五石七斗三升多。而这家农民去年夏收麦子不过十石，全部收入还不够交纳负担。农民的负担不仅粮食而已，养牲口也是养不起的，养一匹骡马每年要出麦子二石，牛和驴每年一石，猪羊每只每年三斗。
    “荞麦皮榨不出油来”，阎匪再无法从农民身上榨取到他所摊派下来的负担项目时，于是就公开抢劫。首先是边缘区，阎匪在这里实行了“三光政策”，其次是他统治的心脏地区。去年夏收以后，阎匪集结二十七个团兵力曾在汾阳、文水、平遥、介休等县之间的地区，残暴抢粮达一个多月，粮食、牲畜、家具一扫而光。
    阎匪在晋中各城市和大小据点每天都在增修碉堡和工事，尤其是以太原为中心的所谓“百里防线”之内，每天都有成千成万的农民被押解着服苦役。晋中人民流传着一首歌谣：“河滩里搬石头，磨烂手指头，头上顶砖头，跌下来挨比斗（即挨打）”。这次晋中战役前的两个月正值春耕紧张之际，平遥、介休、汾阳、孝义等县阎匪每天都要四、五千民夫在介休打石头运到太原去，青年男子已很少了，服役的多半是老人、妇女和小孩，以致有的孕妇生育在乱石堆中。阎匪不供给民夫吃饭，民夫因食粮被刮光无干粮可带，有的竟饿死在途中。然而阎匪还是提心吊胆地觉得他的乌龟壳并不保险，今年四月十五日阎锡山向其属下说：“三十六年感到三十五年做下的工事不够，今年仍感到去年做下的工事不够。”因此阎匪还要继续在太原附近增修碉堡一千二百个，共需蒋币二万一千一百亿元，人工为三十二万个。这一笔负担自然也都出在晋中阎匪控制区人民的身上。至于阎匪在晋中大量抓兵，农村中青壮年大批逃亡，逼得很多农村妇女上吊、跳井自杀，更属常事。
    晋中人民有被迫得忍无可忍起来反抗者，阎锡山匪帮对付的办法，就是比日寇更凶恶的屠杀。去年夏秋之交，阎匪在晋中平川广大地区表演了一次空前残暴的杀人惨剧，仅在文水下曲镇附近即杀死人民百余人，杀伤二千人，抓走三千人。群众避入田中，阎匪就开机枪向田野扫射。十二岁到五十岁的女性都被强奸。在寄谷庄，阎匪一面纵火焚烧房屋，一面蹂躏妇女，拒绝受辱的妇女就被投入火中活活烧死。今年三月九日，汾阳阎匪七十师两个团到了上金庄，群众逃走了，只有三十四个未及逃脱的男女老幼躲在村后一个地洞里，阎匪竟下毒手在洞口堆柴放火，熊熊烈焰涌入洞口去，三十余人全部被烧死。
    阎匪杀人成性，他是一点也不隐讳的。我军缴获阎匪文件“文水县当前工作指示”中第一句话就是“今天是杀人的时代！”下面就是一篇杀字：“见国军逃跑者杀，抗服国民义务者杀，受匪（阎匪对我之诬蔑，下同——编者）驱使者杀，通匪有人者杀，匪来不报者杀，报错者杀”。对解放军家属更要“杀其全家”。又说：“宁可错杀一个，不可少杀一个”。在另一张缴获文件上，更把“乱棍打死”明令为刑法，全篇一连说了十几个“乱棍打死”。阎匪今年一月三十一日发出的“肃伪工作指示”，内称：“近来感到伪装分子越肃越多，这证明了共产党是再接再厉，不怕牺牲，我们的干部内心很脆弱，杀人的内力不够，我们的失败处就在没有能杀人的人。”
    为了杀人，阎锡山发动了一个空前的杀人运动即所谓“自白转生运动”。死于这个运动的，据不完全的统计：平遥四百多人，阳曲三百多人，文水二百多人，徐沟九十三人。其他各县死人无可计算。
    晋中人民不堪阎匪的压榨、奴役、屠杀，大批向解放区逃难。去年夏天，汾阳、文水平川有三万人向解放区逃难。阳曲的白崖头、屋科、小塔等村甚至发生整个村庄向解放区搬家的事情。而还留在晋中的人民则天天盼望着解放军：“咱们的队伍再不来，咱们都快死光了！”当解放军某部到了平川时，许多老太太和老汉拉住战士就下拜，惨然哭诉：“同志，救命吧！我这条老命就交给你们了！”
