Jinan Telegram: Land reform in Beililizhuang, Second District of Yuancheng, has been thoroughly completed. This spring, due to the county and district leading organs neglecting the village's actual situation and the masses' basic demand to focus on production, their ideas on leading production were unclear. There was also no propaganda regarding the Party's land reform and production policies, so the village once exhibited chaos. The masses harbored thoughts of "fear of disrupting equal distribution," and some ate and drank excessively, not focusing on production. After discovering this phenomenon, the county and district leading organs immediately convened mass meetings and group meetings to propagandize and explain our Party's land reform and production policies, explaining that the struggle was now thorough and that land would no longer be equally distributed. This began to stabilize the emotions of the masses and gradually shifted the focus to production.

To organize the masses to do a good job in production, meetings of the branch and non-Party cadres were also convened to review past production leadership issues. Last year, the village was a production base point village and initially pursued a vigorous and bustling approach, committing the formalistic error of only emphasizing scale and not being practical. When helping each other with weeding, the masses were required to go to the fields collectively, and they had to hoe wherever everyone else hoed, regardless of whether they hoed well or not, only requiring that they hoe a lot, hoe quickly, and keep up. As a result, whoever's land was being hoed worried about it not being hoed well. When organizing mutual aid, the leadership forcibly formed groups, appointed group leaders, and forced the masses to implement subjectively prescribed "advanced" methods of calculating work and exchanging labor, which disrupted many voluntarily formed partnerships and mutual aid, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and hindering their enthusiasm for production.

To correct this formalism that was divorced from the masses, the county leading organs, based on the principle of voluntary exchange and the specific situation of the village, decided to abolish the forcibly formed groups and the "advanced" methods of calculating work and exchanging labor that were divorced from reality, and allowed the masses to determine their own methods of equal-value mutual aid based on their needs. Based on the masses' natural partnerships and mutual aid, no matter what organizational form was adopted, as long as the masses voluntarily combined, the work was mutually beneficial, and production could be increased, it was acceptable.

Since correcting the production policies and the past erroneous methods of leading production, the ideological concerns of the masses have been dispelled, greatly increasing their enthusiasm for production. Out of the 194 households in the village, 181 households voluntarily combined into groups in the old organizational form (are they all voluntary? Is there any new disguised coercion? - Editor). They generally adopted a combination of livestock partnerships and human mutual aid. Major tasks such as weeding, delivering manure, harvesting, plowing, harrowing, and hauling soil were done together, while small odd jobs were done separately, truly achieving mutual benefit and a win-win situation. Currently, the masses in the village are weeding and accumulating fertilizer. The whole village has added sixteen new manure pits and eleven new pigs. Each household plans to accumulate three circles of manure, and some plan to accumulate four circles. Each household has already accumulated an average of two circles, exceeding last year's fertilizer production by a quarter.

Village cadres and Party members regularly explain the Party's production policies to the masses. When the village branch discovered that six households employing poor peasants had no food to eat, most lacked seeds and farm tools, they immediately convened a meeting to discuss solutions. Party members Sun Hongkui, Ren Xiuchun, and others volunteered to lend two dan of grain to solve the difficulties of the six households who had no food (Is the "voluntary lending of grain" by Party members truly voluntary, or is it a case of enduring the pain to set a "model example"? This is worth considering and studying - Editor), and decided to use the fruit money and the 171,000 yuan from selling temple bricks and wood through the farmers' association to lend to nineteen poor peasants to buy peanut seeds. The government also allocated 110,000 yuan and 550 jin of grain to lend to twelve households employing poor peasants and nine households of orphans and widows for production. They voluntarily exchanged labor with those who had labor power. Ren Fenghui plowed eight mu of land for Ren Caixuan (female), and Ren Caixuan made a pair of shoes and wove four zhang of calico for Ren Fenghui. In this way, through exchanging labor and mutual aid, they cultivated 64.5 mu of land.

　　说明土改已经彻底  安定情绪推动生产
  　元朝北李庄注意宣传政策
    【冀南电】元朝二区北李庄土改已经彻底。今春由于县区领导机关忽视该村实际情况和群众要好好搞生产的基本要求，对领导生产的思想不明确。也没有宣传党的土改、生产政策，因此该村曾一度呈现混乱现象。群众存有“怕打乱平分”等思想顾虑，有的人大吃大喝，不安心生产。县区领导机关发现这种现象后，立即召开群众大会、小组会进行宣传、讲解我党土改与生产政策，说明斗争现已彻底，土地不再平分，开始安定了群众情绪，逐步转向生产。为了组织群众搞好生产，又召开了支部和非党干部会议，检讨过去生产领导问题。去年该村是生产基点村，一开始就追求轰轰烈烈的大动，犯了只讲求规模，不务实际的形式主义毛病。互助锄地时，要求群众集体下地，要上那锄都上那锄，不管锄的好坏，只要求锄的多，锄得快，跟上趟就行。结果锄谁的地谁担心锄不好。组织互助时，领导上强制编组，指定组长，强制群众执行主观规定的“高级”的计工换工办法，结果把好多自愿结合的搭犋互助也搅散了，引起群众不满，阻碍了群众生产的积极性。为纠正这种脱离群众的形式主义，该县领导机关，根据自愿等价的原则及该村具体情况，做出取消强制编成的组及脱离现实的“高级”计工换工办法，根据群众需要，自己规定等价互助的办法。以群众自然搭犋互助为基础，不论采取什么组织形式，只要是群众自愿结合，做活互不吃亏，能够增产就行。自端正了生产政策、纠正了过去领导生产的错误作法后，解除了群众思想顾虑，大大提高了生产积极性。全村一百九十四户，就有一百八十一户以旧有的组织形式自愿结合了小组（是否都是自愿的？有无新的变象强制的地方？——编者），普遍采用牲口搭犋结合人力互助。锄草、送粪、收割、犁耙、拉土等大活一块干，小零活各干各的，真正作到了互不吃亏，一价两利。现该村群众正在锄苗积肥。全村增加了新粪坑十六个，增加猪十一口，各户都计划积三圈粪，有的计划积四圈，每家平均都已积了两圈，超过去年造肥数四分之一。村干党员经常向群众讲解党的生产政策。村支部发现六户雇贫农没粮食吃，大部分没种子缺农具，便立即开会讨论解决办法。党员孙洪奎、任秀春等六人，自报借出两石粮食，解决六户没吃的困难（党员“自报借粮”，是否真正出于自愿，有无忍着痛起“模范作用”的情形？值得考虑研究——编者），并决定通过农会，把果实款及卖庙砖和木料款十七万一千元，抽出来贷给十九户贫农买花生种。政府又拨款十一万，粮五百五十斤，分贷给十二户雇贫农和九户孤寡生产。他们自愿与有劳力的换工，任风会给任才选（女）耕地八亩，任才选给任风会做一双鞋，织四丈花布，这样换工互助，耕种了六十四亩半地。
