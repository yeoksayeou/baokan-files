Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 8th: Under the slogan "Reduce disaster by one point, increase wealth by one point," water management and flood prevention work in various parts of the Northeast Liberated Areas has achieved preliminary results. After more than 40 days of efforts, cadres and the masses in Antung County have built a dam 13 kilometers long, over 70 meters wide, and 2.5 meters high, turning 120,000 mu of flood-prone land into fertile fields. The water conservancy in this area had always been controlled by feudal forces from the Qing Dynasty until the "August 15th" liberation. At that time, landlords, in order to protect their own land, built a selfish sand dam that blocked the Longtai River, resulting in the flooding of 120,000 mu of sandy land in the four districts of Beijingzi and others in the county. This May, under the leadership of the democratic government, the sand dam was opened, and the massive project of the aforementioned dam was completed.

In the Gengzhuang District of Haicheng, along the Taizi River, waterlogging has worsened in the northwest for the past decade or so. According to local people, "there have been no harvests in five of the last ten years." After our army liberated Haicheng last year, the democratic government sent personnel to thoroughly understand the disaster situation. This spring, 110,000 jin of grain were loaned out to build a dam, organizing the masses to build a river course with a total length of 1,680 meters and a width of 106 meters, turning 20,000 mu of waterlogged land into fertile farmland and freeing 50,000 mu of land and 82 villages from flooding.

More than ten flood prevention projects, including the Handa River and Yalu River within Nenjiang Province, have also been largely completed. It is estimated that after all the large and small flood prevention projects in various places are completed, 1.5 million mu of farmland throughout the province will no longer be flooded.

More than 6,600 commanders and fighters from the Songjiang Military Region who were dispatched to Lalin to dig trenches completed the construction of a 37-li long hoe-shaped drainage trench in eleven days and nights of intensive work. The drainage volume is 345,000 cubic meters, with an average width of 23 meters (the widest being 52 meters) and an average depth of more than 2 meters. After this main canal is dug, it can directly save 62,000 mu of farmland and prevent disasters for 12,000 people. If the masses dig branch canals along this main canal after the harvesting season, then all 940,000 mu of cultivated land in the county can be completely free from flooding. At present, various places are actively planning to seize the slack farming season after harvesting to continue to vigorously repair trenches and build dams, so as to ensure production results and strive for a victorious autumn harvest.

### 东北解放区各地治水防涝　把涝地变成肥活良田

　　东北解放区各地治水防涝
  　把涝地变成肥活良田
    【新华社东北八日电】在“减少一分灾害、增加一分财富”的口号下，东北解放区各地治水防涝工作，已获初步成绩。安东全县干部、群众经四十余天的努力，已修筑成一道长达十三公里、宽七十余公尺、高二公尺五的大坝，使十二万亩水患地变为良田。该地水利从满清到“八一五”解放前，始终为封建势力所把持。那时地主为保护自己的土地，曾筑成一道损人利己的沙坝，堵住龙态河，结果使该县北井子等四个区，十二万亩沙地尽为水淹。今年五月，在民主政府领导下，才凿开该沙坝，完成上述大坝之巨大工程。
    太子河沿岸的海城耿庄区西北部近十余年来水患日甚。据当地群众说，“最近十年中已有五年颗粒未收”。去年我军解放海城后，民主政府即先后派员深入了解水患灾情。今春即贷出修坝粮十一万斤，组织群众修筑一河道，全长一千六百八十公尺，宽一百零六公尺，使两万亩涝地变成肥沃良田，五万亩土地和八十二个村子得免水患。
    嫩江省境内罕达河、雅鲁等十余处防水工程，现亦大部告竣。预计各地大小补修防水工程全部竣工后，全省可有一百五十万亩良田不会再受水淹。
    松江军区开往拉林挖壕的六千六百余指战员，经十一天日夜突击，已于本月十四日挖成长达三十七里的锄形排水壕，排水量为三十四万五千立方公尺，平均宽度二十三公尺（最宽者五十二公尺），平均深度二公尺以上。此一干河挖成后，可直接挽救六万二千亩良田，使一万二千人民免于灾害。若挂锄后，群众再依此干河挖顺水支渠，则全县耕地九十四万亩可完全免除水患。目前各地正积极计划于挂锄后抓紧农闲，继续大力修壕筑坝，以保证生产成果，争取胜利的秋收。
