Xinhua News Agency, North China, 27th: Late news: A unit of the North China People's Liberation Army, combined with local troops, captured Qimen and Xinzhen, 40 li northeast of Jixian County, Northern Henan, on the 14th, annihilating over a thousand enemy self-defense troops from Junxian and Qixian counties. They seized eight machine guns and over 440 long and short guns.

Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram: The local armed forces of Dongming County have been continuously victorious in resisting conscription and grain robbery. On August 6th, the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's 75th Division set out from Kaocheng and arrested more than 40 young people at Jiaoyuanji in our Sixth District. Upon hearing the news, our Sixth District team rushed to the scene and fought the enemy for 20 minutes, forcing the enemy to flee in panic, and all the captured youths were rescued. On the morning of August 8th, three companies of the enemy's 75th Division divided their forces to rob grain at Xianglou, Daliuzhai, Da and Xiao Lizhuang, Zhangxiaoji, and Anzhuang. Our Sixth District team fiercely attacked the enemy northwest of Xianglou. After half an hour of fighting, one enemy soldier was captured and one rifle was seized. All the grain robbed by the enemy was returned to the masses. On August 9th, the enemy's 74th Brigade of the 55th Division launched an attack in two groups. One group, in coordination with the Dongming puppet county government and other local reactionaries, invaded Matou, attempting to conscript soldiers and rob grain in the Fifth District. The other group, in coordination with the Changyuan puppet Third District and other local reactionaries, invaded the Sanliuji area, attempting to conscript soldiers and rob grain in our First, Sixth, and Seventh Districts, and also to sabotage our levee repair work. Our First, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Districts and county armed forces took the initiative to strike at Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. On the 10th, a part of the eastern group of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits reached Niu Ji, but was repelled by our Fifth District team. The western group of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, a battalion, advanced to Chengzhuang and Renzhuang in our Sixth and Seventh Districts and were blocked by our county armed forces and the Sixth District team, unable to advance. On the 11th, the enemy went to the southern part of our First District to conscript soldiers and rob grain, but was again blocked by our militia and work team, failing in their attempt. On the 12th, a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits again went to our × District to rob grain and was ambushed by our Sixth District team at Fanzhuang, killing eight enemy soldiers, wounding three, capturing one, and seizing some supplies. In recent days, Chiang's army has been beaten everywhere while trying to conscript soldiers and rob grain, and has not succeeded in their attempts.
