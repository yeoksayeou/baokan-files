    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS reports: The Soviet newspaper *Labor* published an article on the 25th stating that the political motives of the U.S. Department of Justice in arresting the leaders of the American Communist Party are obvious. The two ruling parties are creating difficulties for the new People's Anti-War Party, which supports Wallace as a presidential candidate, precisely at the height of the U.S. election campaign because the Communist Party, along with other progressive forces in the country, supports this new party. It is also no coincidence that the arrests occurred on the eve of the special session of Congress on July 26th. The charges against the Communist Party are intended to help reactionaries easily pass the Mundt Bill in Congress. The arrest of the U.S. Communist leaders, and the publication of the anti-communist "Bridge Plan" at the same time, is by no means a coincidence either. However, all these efforts of the American reactionaries are doomed to failure. The democratic forces in the United States and other countries will learn a lesson from this latest provocation by the American reactionaries.

    美反动派逮捕美共领袖
    包含着一连串卑鄙阴谋
    苏联劳动报评论
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社讯：苏联劳动报于二十五日著文称，美国司法部逮捕美共领袖的政治动机是一目了然的。两个统治的党，恰恰在美国竞选运动进入高峰的现在，给支持华莱士为总统候选人的新的人民反战政党制造困难。因为共产党和国内其他进步力量一道支持着这个新党。逮捕事件发生于七月二十六日国会特别会议的前夕，这也不是偶然的事。给共产党加上的罪名，是为了帮助反动派能在国会中容易地通过蒙特法案。美共领袖的被捕，和反共的“布里奇计划”之发表同时发生，也绝不是偶合的。但是，美国反动分子这一切努力，是注定失败的。美国和其他国家的民主力量，将从美国反动分子最近这一次挑衅中取得教训。
