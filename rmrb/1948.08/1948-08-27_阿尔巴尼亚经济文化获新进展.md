Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 22nd: Moscow News: Shabanov, head of the Soviet delegation that recently returned from Albania, spoke of the significant progress made by Albania in the economic and cultural fields, saying: The oil industry, formerly owned by Italians, is now operated by people's representatives. Previously, all the oil produced was imported to Italy, but now it fully supplies Albanian industry and can fully meet its needs. Oil production has been greatly increased, and oil workers' wages have increased many times over. After the Albanian farmers were given land, they organized the first batch of 20 collective labor groups and established 25 machine and tractor stations. In the cultural field, since the enactment of the Compulsory Universal Education Law two years ago, the number of new schools opened is three times more than in the ten years of King Zog's rule. According to a special article in Moscow's "Culture and Education Work" magazine: "Albania now has 1,620 primary schools, accommodating 132,000 children, accounting for 87 percent of the total number of school-age children in the country (based on Albania's population of one million). Secondary schools have been greatly expanded, and Albania's first higher education institution—a normal college—has been established. Other institutions of higher learning will also open soon. In order to eliminate illiteracy, 75,000 adults have graduated from special training classes, and reading rooms and cultural houses have been set up in the countryside. Not long ago, almost all the people of Albania were illiterate."

　　阿尔巴尼亚经济文化获新进展
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科讯：顷自阿尔巴尼亚归来之苏联访问团团长夏巴诺夫谈及阿国在经济文化方面的重大进展称：从前属于意大利人所有的石油工业，现在已由人民代表经营。从前出产的石油全部输入意大利，现在则完全供应阿国工业并能充分满足其需要。石油产量已大大提高，石油工人工资已增加了好几倍。阿国农民在分得土地后，已组织了第一批的廿个集体劳动团体，并建立了二十五个机器与拖拉机站。文化方面自制定强迫普及教育法两年以来，开设的新学校比佐格王统治的十年内还要多三倍。另据莫斯科“文化与教育工作”杂志所载专文称：“阿国现在已有一千六百二十所初级学校，收容儿童十三万二千人，占全国学龄儿童总数百分之八十七（按阿国人口计一百万）。中等学校已大大扩充，并成立了阿国有史以来第一所高等教育机关——师范学院，其他高等学府亦将于最近开学。为了肃清文盲，已有七万五千成人在特训班中毕业，乡村中均设有阅览室与文化之家。而不久以前，阿国的全体人民几乎都还是文盲。”
