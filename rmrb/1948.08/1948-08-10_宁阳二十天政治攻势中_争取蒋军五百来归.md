    [Ji Lu Yu Electric] The "Reception Center for Chiang Kai-shek's Fleeing Officers and Soldiers" established by the Ningyang Democratic Government received a total of 504 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who came over from July 5th to July 25th, a period of twenty days. According to Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had escaped, Chiang's officers were afraid that the soldiers would run away, so they were only allowed to be three steps apart during marches. Those who fell behind by five steps would be beaten ten times with a stick, and those who fell behind by ten steps would be shot. Li Shunbo, who escaped from the reorganized 84th Division, said that the reorganized 84th Division universally requires soldiers to have "overseas student" haircuts, saying that the Liberation Army will kill those they capture with "overseas student" haircuts. Last time, I prepared to sneak away and shaved off my "overseas student" haircut, but after being found out, I was beaten twenty times with a stick. Now, after I escaped, the Liberation Army not only doesn't kill me, but also provides food and sends me home.

    宁阳二十天政治攻势中
    争取蒋军五百来归
    【冀鲁豫电】宁阳民主政府设立之“蒋方逃亡官兵招待所”，由七月五日到二十五日二十天中，共有蒋方逃亡士兵五百零四名来归。据逃出之蒋方士兵谈，蒋军军官怕士兵逃跑，行军时每人只准距离三步。掉队五步者揍十棍，掉队十步者枪毙。整八十四师逃出之李顺舶说，现在整八十四师普遍要士兵留洋头，说是解放军捉着留洋头的就杀。上次，我准备偷跑，把洋头剃掉了，被查出后，挨了二十棍子。现在，我逃跑出来，解放军不但不杀，还管饭送回家。
