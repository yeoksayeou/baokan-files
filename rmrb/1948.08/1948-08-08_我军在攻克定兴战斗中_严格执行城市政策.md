    【Telegram from the Pingbao Front】 During the battle to capture Dingxing City on August 17th, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) at the Pingbao Front strictly adhered to various policies and disciplines. All wounded officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army were given medical assistance. The seriously wounded were transported to hospitals on stretchers, ensuring timely treatment for over 400 wounded Chiang soldiers. Additionally, the remains of over 200 Chiang soldiers were properly buried by the PLA. Prior to the start of the battle, a PLA unit organized a working group specifically responsible for collecting wounded Chiang soldiers and burying the dead. Personnel from the Kuomintang government's economic, cultural, and health agencies who did not resist with weapons were not taken as prisoners. Those mistakenly arrested were released upon discovery. Guards were assigned to government agencies, warehouses, and hospitals to prevent unauthorized entry or any acts of destruction. Furthermore, the heads of Chiang's 31st Provisional Division Field Hospital, 26th Hospital, and 13th Hospital were persuaded to treat the wounded Chiang soldiers. When they ran out of food, the PLA immediately provided provisions, allowing the medical staff in these hospitals to continue working without worry. When the 6th squad of the 5th company of a PLA unit entered the Kuomintang county government office, they discovered a large pile of Chiang currency, but no one touched it. The PLA made every effort to protect industry and commerce. After capturing Dingxing Railway Station, the 3rd Battalion of a PLA unit discovered a large amount of goods in the warehouses of over ten firms, including Gongxingshun, Qingfeng, Xingfa, and Dashengmao. A large quantity of merchants' goods was also stored in the railway station post office. Consequently, guards were assigned to protect the goods, leaving them untouched. The PLA's actions deeply moved the people of the city, the wounded officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, and government personnel. A doctor from the Kuomintang County Hospital voluntarily approached the PLA's city entry work committee immediately after the battle and proposed organizing public and private hospitals to accommodate the wounded. He said, "After the PLA entered the city, people (referring to Kuomintang government personnel) all hid, but no one expected that the PLA would release all the non-combatants from their side (referring to the Chiang side)." Additionally, nine slightly wounded Chiang soldiers, after being bandaged by the PLA, approached the city work committee that same evening, requesting to join the PLA.

    我军在攻克定兴战斗中
    严格执行城市政策
    【平保前线电】平保前线解放军，于八月十七日攻克定兴城战斗中，严格遵守各种政策纪律。对国民党军负伤官兵，一律予以救护，伤重者均用担架送入医院救治，使四百多名蒋军的轻重伤员，都得到及时治疗。另有二百余具蒋军尸首，并均由解放军妥为掩埋。解放军某部在战斗未开始前，即已组织一工作组，专门负责收容蒋军伤员，掩埋蒋军尸体。对国民党政府的经济文化卫生机关人员，凡不持枪抵抗者，一律不加俘虏，个别因误会被捕者，一经查觉，即予释放。对各该政府机关、仓库、医院等，均派人守卫，禁止闲人入内，或进行任何破坏。同时说服蒋军暂三十一师野战医院、二六医院、一三医院等负责人，收容为受伤的蒋军医治。他们没有粮食吃，解放军立即发给吃粮，使各该医院医务人员，均安心的照常工作。某部五连六班，攻入国民党县政府时，发现一大堆蒋币，但谁也没有上前翻动。对于工商业，解放军更全力保护。某部三营于攻克定兴车站后，发现公兴顺、庆丰、兴发、大生茂等十余家货栈内，物资堆积甚多，车站邮局内，也存有大批商人物资，于是，就派人看管，原封未动。解放军上述行动，使全城人民及国民党军负伤官兵、机关人员，深为感动。国民党县立医院某大夫于战斗刚结束，即自动找到解放军的入城工作委员会，提议把公私医院都组织起来，安置伤员。他说：“解放军进城后，人们（指国民党机关人员）都躲起来了，可是谁也没想到，解放军把这方面（指蒋方）的非战斗人员，全都放了。”另有九个蒋军轻伤员，经解放军包扎后，当晚就找到城市工作委员会，要求参加解放军。
