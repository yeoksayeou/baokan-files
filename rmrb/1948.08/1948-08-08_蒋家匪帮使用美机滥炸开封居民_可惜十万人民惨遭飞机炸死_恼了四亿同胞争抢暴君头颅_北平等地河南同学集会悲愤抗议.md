Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th: News from Beiping and Tianjin newspapers: The crime of the Kuomintang ruling clique using American-made bombers to cruelly massacre peaceful residents of Kaifeng has aroused grief and indignation among teachers and students of universities in North China and Northeast China. To this end, the Henan Alumni Associations of eighteen universities in North China and Northeast China held a "Memorial Service for the 100,000 Wrongfully Killed Souls of Kaifeng and Indictment Meeting" in Beiping on July 5th. In the memorial hall was placed "The Spirit Tablet of the 100,000 Wrongfully Killed Souls of Kaifeng," with the four characters "Bestowed by Pacification" written on it. Professors, students, and representatives of student unions from thirteen universities and colleges in Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan who attended the meeting unanimously condemned the Kuomintang's crime of bombing the people of Kaifeng. The elegiac couplets hung on the four walls fully demonstrated the sentiment of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas today, who are irreconcilable with the Kuomintang's traitorous ruling clique. One elegiac couplet read: "What crime have the people committed to suffer such a catastrophe? When will the time come for it to perish, to die together with you!". Another stated, "Unfortunately, 100,000 people were tragically killed by bombing; enraged 400 million compatriots fought to seize the tyrant's head."

Prior to the indictment meeting, more than 120 professors from universities in Beiping jointly issued a declaration on June 28, opposing the Kuomintang's destruction of cultural institutions and bombing of cities. On the same day, the Henan Alumni Associations of Peking University and eight other universities issued "An Appeal to Students Across the Country Regarding the Indiscriminate Bombing of Kaifeng Residents," advocating that the responsibility for the Kuomintang's crime of indiscriminately bombing Kaifeng residents be investigated.

    【新华社华北六日电】平津报纸消息：国民党统治集团使用美制轰炸机残酷屠杀开封和平居民的罪行，激起华北及东北各大学师生的悲愤抗议。华北、东北十八所大学河南同学会，为此于七月五日在北平举行“哀悼开封十万冤魂控诉大会”。祭堂中设“开封十万冤魂之灵位”，上书“戡乱所赐”四个大字。到会教授、学生及平、津、唐山十三院校学生自治会代表，一致谴责国民党轰炸开封人民的罪行。四壁所悬挽联中充分显示出今日国民党统治区人民与国民党卖国统治集团势不两立的情绪，挽联中有：“百姓何辜，遭此浩劫？时日曷丧，及汝偕亡！”。“可惜十万人民，惨遭飞机炸死；恼了四亿同胞，争抢暴君头颅。”
    在控诉大会举行前，北平各大学教授一百二十余人于六月二十八日联名发表宣言，反对国民党破坏文化机关及轰炸城市。同日，北大等九大学河南同学会发表“为滥炸开封居民告全国同学书”，主张追究国民党滥炸开封居民罪行的责任。
