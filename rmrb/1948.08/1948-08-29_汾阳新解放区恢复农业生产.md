　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 26th: The Fenyang Democratic Government is actively leading farmers in the newly liberated areas to restore agricultural production. In the past, due to Yan Xishan's bandit regime's "integration of soldiers and farmers" tyranny, many farmers in the county were forced to flee collectively, and most of the land was barren. According to statistics from nine villages including Renyan, more than 15,000 mu of the original 25,800 mu of cultivated land was abandoned, accounting for 58% of the total cultivated area. After the establishment of the democratic regime in the area, it immediately reduced military service, dispatched cadres to various villages to organize mutual aid in labor, and mobilized women and children to participate in farm work. Due to the summer drought, the government also provided seeds and sowed a large amount of millet, buckwheat, and other late autumn crops in preparation for surviving the spring famine next year. As a result, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has been greatly increased, and they have been going to the land to reclaim wasteland. According to recent inspections, more than 5,500 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in only nine villages including Shangmang.
　　Furthermore, the Wenyu River in the county was dredged and dams were built by the democratic government in 1946. After Yan Xishan's bandits occupied the area, the people suffered heavy labor and looting, resulting in disrepair of the river channels and dams. Every year, when mountain floods erupted, the Baijinbao breach occurred, flooding tens of thousands of mu of fertile land in more than 20 villages along the river. The 3,000 mu of cultivated land in Luocheng Town, which is located in a low-lying area, was even transformed into a lake. After the area was recovered by our forces, the democratic government immediately organized a water conservancy committee to lead the people in digging rivers and building dams. At present, the riverbed has been deepened and widened, and the dams and sluice gates in Baijinbao, Luocheng Town and other places have been repaired. The accumulated water in the 3,000 mu of low-lying land in Luocheng has been completely drained. Farmers along the river are actively preparing to sow winter wheat.

　　汾阳新解放区恢复农业生产
    【新华社晋绥二十六日电】汾阳民主政府积极领导新区农民恢复农业生产。过去由于阎匪“兵农合一”暴政，该县农民多被迫集体逃亡，土地大部荒芜。据仁岩等九个村统计，原有耕地二万五千八百多亩，就荒了一万五千多亩，占全耕地面积百分之五十八。该地民主政权建立后，立即减少军勤，派出干部到各村组织劳动互助，及发动妇女儿童参加地里劳动。由于夏旱，政府并供给种子，大量播种糜谷荞麦等晚秋作物，作渡过明年春荒的准备。因此农民生产情绪大为提高，纷纷上地开垦。据最近检查，仅上邙等九村即已开荒地五千五百余亩。
    又该县文峪河于一九四六年曾经民主政府兴修河道和堤坝。阎匪侵占该地后，人民遭受繁重劳役和抢掠，致河道堤坝失修，每年山洪暴发时便于百金堡决口，淹没沿河廿余村良田数万亩，地势低洼的罗城镇三千亩耕地更变为湖泊。此次该地为我收复后，民主政府立即组织水利委员会领导人民挖河筑坝。现河床已挖深加宽，百金堡、罗城镇等地堤坝水闸已修竣，罗城三千亩洼地积水全部排出。沿河农民正积极准备播种冬麦。
