　　[Jilu Yu Telegram] In order to enable governments and cadres at all levels to better accept the democratic supervision of the people, correct bureaucratic work styles, and utilize newspapers to further connect democratic government with the masses, the Jilu Yu Administrative Office specially issued a circular to governments and cadres at all levels, urging them to respect the critical articles published in newspapers on various tasks. The circular pointed out: (1) The "Voices of the Masses" and "Criticisms and Suggestions" columns in newspapers are places for the people to express their opinions and weapons for supervising bureaucracy. Governments at all levels must take a serious attitude towards the above two columns, as well as the criticisms and inquiries raised in newspapers, and promptly conduct investigations with a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people. Any phenomenon of refusing to investigate or deliberately delaying should be strictly criticized. Those who persist in their mistakes will be subject to disciplinary action. (2) When leading departments and responsible comrades discover certain shortcomings and errors in the work of their departments in the newspapers, regardless of the source of the opinions or whether they are correct, they should immediately conduct an investigation. Absolutely no phenomenon of neglect or shelving is allowed. One cannot think that this is a matter for lower levels and cannot adopt a bureaucratic attitude. (3) No department should panic and simply investigate the matter just because that matter has been criticized. After clarifying the situation, a careful analysis should be carried out, and from this, similar matters should be linked; the problems in leadership should be identified, the key should be found, and a thorough and comprehensive solution should be given in order to truly achieve the purpose of improving leadership and work. (Editor's note: The Jilu Yu Administrative Office's circular to all levels to respect newspaper criticism is a very good and important decision. In addition to checking shortcomings and improving work based on the criticisms in the newspapers, those who are criticized should also publicly express their attitude in the newspapers. If they are wrong, they should make a self-criticism; if the criticism is wrong, they should defend themselves, so as to truly achieve the goal of clarifying the facts, uncovering errors and shortcomings, and improving work.)
