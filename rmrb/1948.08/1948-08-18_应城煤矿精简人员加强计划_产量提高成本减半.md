(Taiyue Telegram) The Yingcheng State-Operated Coal Mine in Changzi has made preliminary improvements in its operational management methods, which have reduced costs by 50%. The Yingcheng Coal Mine is one of the mechanized coal mines in the Shangdang area, with a peak workforce of over 500. After liberation, due to a lack of experience, the management structure of the general factory was "top-heavy," with overlapping departments and sections that were not interconnected. Furthermore, there was no dedicated person in charge of the branch factories, and there were too many non-directly productive personnel (such as basket foremen, tin foremen, and muleteer foremen, totaling 96 non-directly productive and semi-productive personnel), accounting for one-third of the entire factory's workforce. In terms of industrial materials, there was a lack of scientific, precise calculation and in-depth inspection, resulting in significant waste. For example, due to a lack of attention to inspection and timely repair of the mine bottom's water channels, 167 water workers were needed daily, who could otherwise have been saved, as well as more than 110 coal pillar timbers. Each high-lift machine, regardless of its working speed or duration, was issued 8.12 catties of oil daily, leading to waste of industrial materials. Wages were too high, with ordinary haulers earning three *dou* of corn per day (approximately 30 small baskets of coal, exceeding pre-war wages by four times; pre-war ordinary wages were seven small baskets of coal per day). Due to the above reasons, the cost of coal was too high. At the end of last year, the calculated cost was 1.2 *sheng* of rice per small basket (40 catties), resulting in a loss. By April of this year, it was almost a case of losing money for every basket sold. Comrade Wu Shaolin, the manager, recognized during the Party rectification study in March that this serious situation was a significant loss to the revolution. After returning to the factory, he worked with the Party branch and the trade union to jointly study the situation and convene factory affairs, Party member, and worker conferences to promote democratic discussion, enabling everyone to reach a consensus and immediately start the transformation. First, 61 unnecessary non-directly productive personnel were resolutely laid off, saving 86.8 *shi* of millet in wages and food each month. Cadres of the general factory were assigned to strengthen the leadership of the branch factories. The slogan "Pay attention to the mine bottom" was put forward, and technicians were collaborated with to conduct in-depth inspections of the mine bottom. Under the accurate calculation and guidance of the technicians, since May, the entire mine has reduced the number of water workers by 100 per day compared to before, saving about 110 timbers. Materials were issued for the machines on a piece-by-piece basis, saving the entire factory eight catties of machine oil per day compared to the past. In terms of output, the unplanned state of "produce more when there is more, produce less when there is less" was overcome. Standard output was assessed based on the coal seam thickness, height, kiln road distance, slope size, coal quality hardness, and labor force size of each mine. Specific requirements were put forward for each mine. The implementation has been very effective, and output has generally increased. In May, the average daily output per worker in each factory increased by one to one and a half large baskets (800 catties per large basket) compared to the past. Wages were initially adjusted based on technology, adopting a method of self-reporting, public discussion, and factory-worker agreement. As a result of improvements in all aspects, by the end of June of this year, the cost per small basket had dropped from 1.2 *sheng* of rice to 0.6 *sheng*. Business methods have also been significantly improved, overcoming the bureaucratic style of stopping coal loading outside of office hours, and providing farmers with various conveniences. Coal prices are accepted for timber and grain at market prices. The business situation has greatly improved in the past two months. Although it is the busy farming season, the number of coal haulers has increased instead, and the highest daily sales volume has reached 400,000 catties, catching up with the peak sales level of last winter. Since the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the mine has continued to study and improve based on the specific policies for state-owned enterprises.

　　应城煤矿精简人员加强计划
  　产量提高成本减半
    【太岳电】长子应城公营煤矿初步改善经营管理方法，已便成本降低了百分之五十。应城煤矿是上党地区机器煤矿之一，最多时工人达五百余。解放以后，由于缺乏经验，在总厂管理机构上“头重脚轻”，科股重叠，互不连系；又无专人领导分厂；非直接生产人员过多（如筐头、锡头、马夫头等。合计非直接生产人员与半生产人员共九十六名），占全厂人数三分之一。在工料方面，缺乏科学的精确计算与深入检查，浪费很多。如不注意检查与及时修理窑底水道，每日要用本来可以节省的水工一百六十七个，煤柱木料一百十多根。每部高车不问工作速度如何，不问时间长短，一律每日发油八斤十二两，以致工料浪费。工资过高，普通拖工每人每日工资达三斗玉茭（约合三十小筐煤，超过了战前工资的四倍，战前普通每日七小筐煤）。由于以上种种原因，造成了煤炭成本过大，去年底核算每小筐（四十斤）合米一升二合，已呈赔钱现象，到今年四月份几乎是卖一筐赔一筐。经理吴少林同志在三月份整党学习中，认识了这一严重情况是对革命的重大损失，回厂后即协同支部、工会共同研究，分别召集厂务、党员及职工大会，展开民主讨论，使大家认识一致，即着手改造。首先坚决裁减了不必要的非直接生产人员六十一名，每月节省了工资伙食小米八十六石八斗；总厂干部分工负责加强各分厂领导；提出“注重窑底”的口号，协同技师深入窑底检查，在技师精确计算指导下，自五月以来，每日全矿较前减少水工一百个，节省木料一百一十根左右。机器上也实行按件发料，每天全厂比过去省下机器油八斤。在产品上也克服了过去“出多就多，出少就少”的无计划状态，按各矿井的煤层厚薄、高低、窑路远近、坡度大小、煤质更硬、人力多少，评定了标准产量；对各矿井提出了具体要求。实行后收效很大，产量普遍提高。五月份每个厂工平均每天比过去增加一大筐到一筐半（每大筐八百斤），工资则以技术为标准，采取自报公议、厂工协议的方式进行了初步调整。各方面改进的结果，至今年六月底，每小筐成本已由过去一升二合米降为六合。营业方法也有显著改善，克服了以往过了办公时间就停止装煤的官僚作风，给农民以各种方便。拿木料粮食交煤价都按市价折收。两月来营业状况大大改进，虽在农忙季节，拉煤的人反而增多，每日销售最高额达到四十万斤，赶上了去冬旺销时的水平。自华北工商会议后，该矿又根据公营企业的各项具体政策，继续研究改进。
