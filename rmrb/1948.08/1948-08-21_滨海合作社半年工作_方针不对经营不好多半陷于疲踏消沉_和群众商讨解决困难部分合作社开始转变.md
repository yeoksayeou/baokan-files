Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th. The Binhai Cooperative Promotion Agency recently summarized its work in supporting people's production, managing transportation, and supply and marketing cooperatives in the first half of the year.

Under the general task of production and disaster relief, a total of 980,000 catties of cotton, yellow tobacco, and hemp were organized for disaster-stricken compatriots and the general population within half a year, with a total transportation cost of 75.64 million Beihai currency (hereinafter referred to as "yuan"); in addition, the transportation of raincoats, cloth, etc., was organized, and the people received transportation fees of more than 19.57 million yuan. In order to support the sideline production of the people in Zhuting (formerly Ganyu County, renamed), Junan (newly established county), Linyi and other counties, 55 million yuan was used to purchase 41,000 raincoats, reeds, and straw sandals. Seven ironware cooperatives in Huantinggou, Junan, etc., with the support of 4 million yuan in loans from the Promotion Agency, cast a total of 4,487 pieces of plows, shovels, ploughs, chaff cutters, hoes, sickles, etc.; The Bepu Cooperative in Rizhao also adjusted 11,830 pieces of farm tools and transported them to Rizhao, Junan, Ju County, Zhuting and other counties for promotion to supply the needs of farmers. In Jufeng and other six districts of Rizhao County alone, during this period, more than 13,000 catties of thread were spun, 6,772 bolts of large and small cloth were woven, 173,000 catties of cotton were fluffed, and the people were organized to transport goods, etc. The people earned more than 410 million yuan in total. The spinning and weaving business of the Bepu Cooperative has developed even further, with the number of spinning households increasing from 1,500 to 2,050, and the number of looms increasing from 90 to 147, with the people earning a total of more than 81 million yuan.

However, in the past six months, due to the spring famine, rising prices, reduced profits, and excessive wages, most of the cooperatives in various places have become stagnant and declined, or even collapsed. For example, Zhuting originally had 104 cooperatives, and now three-fifths of them have collapsed. In a certain county, 207 out of 445 cooperatives have also collapsed; 80% of the looms in the entire region are also in a state of shutdown. The main reasons are: (1) In the past, cooperatives were mostly developed with the support of the public. Therefore, the idea of relying on the public was relatively serious, and the idea of relying on the masses was not established. At present, when the public cannot provide substantial support, the cooperatives complain everywhere when they encounter difficulties and do not discuss solutions with the members of the cooperative. (2) In the past, it was right for cooperatives to focus on spinning and weaving, but because this year's disaster was serious and the people's purchasing power decreased, coupled with rising prices, the spinning and weaving of each cooperative suffered losses, resulting in the inability to sell cloth, which caused the spinning and weaving to generally stop or decrease, affecting the continued operation of the cooperative. For example, in Zhujiawazi and Qiuguanzhuang villages in Junan, which have a good foundation in spinning and weaving, 14 of the original 24 looms are now shut down, and 10 are half-operating; of the original 390 spinning wheels, only 39 are currently running. This shows the state of stagnation in other general areas. (3) Cooperatives do not change their style and business according to changes in the environment and market needs; in the case of high prices and a shrinking scope of business, each cooperative still does everything, but it is not what the people need. At the same time, each cooperative still maintains the original staff, and the expenses are very high. As a result, the funds are gradually depleted, and the cooperative gradually declines. Later, although the leadership proposed that supporting agriculture should be the main focus, and that diverse sideline production should be organized in the gaps of organizing and promoting agricultural production, the cooperatives did not know how to transform themselves. Some believed that spinning and weaving could not be sustained, so they kicked spinning and weaving away. Many cooperatives, without investigation and research, bought a large number of farm tools without a plan, but could not sell them, which caused the cooperatives to decline. (4) The simple relief point of view, excessively raising and guaranteeing the profits and wages of people's sideline production, making the finished products exceed the market price, led to the cooperatives losing money and collapsing. This spring, the leadership unreasonably stipulated wage standards, such as stipulating that the wage for first-class thread was 8 to 10 catties of grain, and the wage for third-class thread was 5 to 6 catties of grain, while at that time, the market price for a catty of thread was only about 4 catties of grain. The Chenjialao Wo Cooperative in Zhuanggang District, Junan, lost 30,000 yuan per scale (100 catties) of flax because it guaranteed the prescribed oil pressing profit. The district cadres of the Jufeng Victory Cooperative in Rizhao asked to take out more than 12 million yuan from the public accumulation and welfare fund for disaster relief, which caused dissatisfaction among employees and members. (5) After the leadership proposed to stop speculative trade, the cooperatives mistakenly regarded the legitimate trade of regulating the market and stabilizing prices as speculative trading and did not dare to do it, which greatly reduced the business of the cooperatives. For example, cotton in Pingshang was cheaper than in Bepu, so the Pingshang Cooperative did not dare to buy cotton and semi-finished cotton to sell in the Bepu market; the Yongli Cooperative acquired brooms and transported them to central Shandong in their own carts to exchange for hoes, ploughs and other farm tools, but it was also considered speculative trading and dared not report it. (6) Some cooperatives became stagnant and collapsed due to excessive withdrawals of shares, accounts receivable, and loans, which made it impossible for the funds to circulate. This spring, when various agencies were clearing their assets, many agencies withdrew their shares; ordinary members saw that prices were rising and the cooperatives were not making money or even losing money, so they also withdrew their shares. However, some village cadres did not withdraw their shares, the purpose of which was to facilitate their own borrowing and accounts receivable. Some cooperatives even became the support shops of the village government and cadres. For example, the Lishan Oil Cooperative in Rizhao extended 2 to 3 million yuan in accounts receivable within five or six days. The Qiuguanzhuang Cooperative in Junan had 900,000 yuan in funds, and out of more than 200 households in the village, 160 households owed the cooperative 1 million yuan in funds.

In the half-year of operation, some cooperatives have begun to transform and embark on a normal and consolidated road. 1. Discuss with the masses, solve difficulties, and organize sideline production according to local conditions. For example, the Zhujiawazi Cooperative in Junan was burned down by the Chiang Kai-shek army last year. The staff discussed with the masses and not only built the houses, but also expanded the dyeing workshop and blacksmith's shop, and concentrated some funds to organize spinning and weaving and raincoat making to solve the livelihood of disaster-stricken households. 2. The Shangyuzi Cooperative streamlined its personnel according to its own business, reducing the number of people eating in the cooperative from 22 in the past to 8, saving expenses, and the cooperative affairs continued as usual. The Yongli Cooperative used to have 20 lamps on every night, but later reduced it by 10, which did not hinder the office work and saved 60,000 yuan per month; the Zhujiawazi Cooperative, six staff members adopted a system of exchanging labor for farming to solve the contradiction between work and production. During busy farming seasons, one person stayed at home to take care of the house, two people went to the market, and three people often worked in the fields. When the farming work was urgent, they stopped going to the market and adopted the method of opening the door three times a day (morning, noon, and evening). The rest of the time, everyone worked together. 3. In spinning and weaving, the Yongli Cooperative, according to market conditions, raised the quality of spinning and weaving and reduced costs under the principle of working whenever there was free time and working whenever it was profitable. The woven cloth weighed only 9.5 catties per bolt, which was of very good quality and used 3 to 4 catties less thread than in the past.

The summary finally proposed that in the next six months, the cooperative's business should focus on supporting agricultural production; in the gaps of agricultural activities, diverse sideline production should be organized according to local conditions. In the future, the cooperatives should focus on rectification and consolidation, and carry out joint transportation and improve the quality of spinning and weaving and reduce costs under the principle of "both public and private interests, and both labor and capital benefit." It also emphasized that cooperatives in various places should refer to and study the above-mentioned transformation examples.

　　滨海合作社半年工作
  　方针不对经营不好多半陷于疲踏消沉
    和群众商讨解决困难部分合作社开始转变
    【新华社华东十六日电】滨海合作推进社顷总结上半年扶持人民生产，经营运输，和供销等合作工作。
    在生产救灾总任务下，半年内共组织灾难胞及一般人民运棉花、黄烟、麻共九十八万斤，共支运费北海币（下同）七万万五百六十四万余元；另又组织运蓑衣、布匹等，人民获运费一千九百五十七万余元。为扶持竹庭（原赣榆县改名）莒南（新设县）临沂等县人民副业生产，又以五千五百万元收购蓑衣韦竿草鞋共四万一千余件。莒南欢町沟等七处铁工社，在推进社四百万元贷款扶持下，共铸铧、锨、犁、铡、锄、镰刀等四四八七件；日照碑廓社，亦调剂农具一一八三○件运往日照、莒南、莒县、竹庭等县推销，供给农民需要。仅日照县巨峰等六个区，此时期内，即纺线一万三千余斤，织大小布六七七二匹，弹花十七万三千余斤及组织人民运输等，人民共获利四万万一千余万元。碑廓社纺织事业更有发展，纺户由一千五百名增至二千零五十名，织机由九十张增至一四七张，人民共获利八千一百余万元。
    但半年来各地合作社，在春荒和物价上涨，盈利聚减及工资过高等情况下，多半走上消沉、疲蹋，甚至垮台。如竹庭原有合作社一○四处，现已垮了五分之三。某县四四五处亦垮了二○七处；全区百分之八十的织机亦趋停顿状态。其主要原因：（一）过去合作社多由公家扶持发展。因此，依赖公家思想比较严重，而依靠群众的思想没有树立起来。在目前公家不能大量扶持的情况下，各社遇到困难就到处叫苦，不与社员群众研究办法，解决困难。（二）过去合作社以纺织为主是对的，但因今年灾荒严重，群众购买力降低，再加物价上涨，因此各社纺织亏本，致布匹推销不出去，使纺织普遍停顿中减少，影响合作社继续营业。如纺织基础较好的莒南朱家洼子和邱官庄两村，原有织机二十四张，现停顿的有十四张，半动不动的有十张，原有三九○辆纺车，现转动的只有三十九辆。由此可见其他一般地区的停顿状态。（三）合作社不根据环境变化和市场需要来转变作风和业务；在物价高涨，经营范围缩小情况下，各社仍样样都搞，而又非人民所需要。同时，各社仍保持原有的人员，开支很大，结果，资金逐渐吃光，合作社渐趋消沉。以后，领导上虽提出应以扶持农业为主，在组织推动农业生产空隙中来组织多样的副业生产，但各社不知怎么转法，有些认为纺织吃不开了，就把纺织一脚踢开，不少合作社不经调查研究，无计划买来大批农具，又推销不出去，使合作社消沉。（四）单纯的救济观点，过高的提高和保证人民副业生产的利润、工资，成品超出市场价格，致使合作社赔本垮台。今春领导上曾不合理的规定工资标准，如纺线规定一等线工资八至十斤粮、三等五至六斤粮，而当时一斤线工资市价只有四斤粮食左右。莒南壮岗区陈家老窝合作社，因为保证规定的打油利润，每秤（一百斤）麻子便赔三万元。日照巨峰胜利合作社，区干部叫拿出公积公益金一千二百余万元救灾，引起职工社员不满。（五）领导上提出停止投机贸易后，各社就把调剂市场稳定物价的正当贸易错认为是投机买卖而不敢做，大大缩小了合作社的业务。如坪上棉花比碑廓贱，坪上社就不敢买棉花和成条花去碑廓集销售；永利社收购了扫帚，以自己大车运往鲁中换回锄犁等农具，亦认为是投机贸易不敢上报。（六）部分合作社因抽股赊帐借钱过多，资金无法周转而趋停滞垮台。今春各机关清理资财时，机关抽股很多；一般社员看到物价上涨，合作社不赚钱甚至赔本，亦纷纷抽股。但有些村干却不抽股，目的是便于自己借钱赊帐，有些社且成了村政府及干部的支伙铺，如日照利山油社，五六天内就赊出二三百万元。莒南邱官庄社有资金九十万元，全村二百余户，即有一百六十户赊借合作社资金达一百万元。
    在半年营业中，有部分合作社已开始转变，走上正常巩固的道路。一、与群众商讨，解决困难，根据当地情况组织副业生产。如莒南朱家洼子合作社，去年被蒋军烧光，职员即与群众商讨，不但把房子盖起来，且染坊与铁匠炉日趋扩大，并集中部分资金组织纺织、结蓑衣，解决灾户生活。二、上峪子社根据本社业务精简人员，由过去二十二人在社吃饭，减至八人，节约了开支，社务仍照常进行。永利社过去每晚二十个灯头，后减去十个，并不妨碍办公，每月就节省了六万元；朱家洼子社，六个职员采取变工耕种解决了工作与生产矛盾，农忙时留一人看家，两人赶集，三人经常干庄稼活，庄稼活紧急时就停止了赶集，采取一日三开门（早晨、中午、傍晚）的办法，其余时间全体动手干活。三、永利社在纺织上，根据市场情况，在有空就干，赚钱就干的原则下，提高纺织质量减低成本，织出的布每一大匹才九斤半重，质量很好，比过去少用三斤至四斤线。
    总结中最后提出；今后半年内，合作社业务应以扶植农业生产为主；在农业空隙中，根据当地情况组织多样的副业生产。今后合作社以整理巩固为主，在“公私兼顾劳资两利”原则下，开展联合运输及提高纺织质量，减低成本。并着重指出各地合作社应参考研究上述转变实例。
