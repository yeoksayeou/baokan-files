[Jizhong Telegram] The army and civilians in the border areas of Jinghai and other counties are actively repairing and protecting dikes under armed cover. Cadres and local people in a certain district of Jinghai have, in three days, blocked the twelve breaches that the Chiang bandits dug in the Daqing River last year. They also joined the masses of Wenxin and Shengfang to build up the dangerous works on the west Qinghe dike at Fuguan Camp. Li Jiawanzi on the banks of the Ziya River had three breaches caused by Chiang bandits last year. After our army captured this stronghold on July 14, the Jinghai County Government immediately mobilized the masses to rush to block them. Under the cover of the troops and the armed work team, they have been repaired. However, due to the strong water flow, water leakage holes were discovered again on the 28th. County and district cadres immediately led the masses to do their best to block them. Although the Chiang bandits in Duliu twice used machine guns to strafe and disrupt the destruction, they were finally blocked under the protection of our armed forces. On the 28th, the dikes south and north of Ziyazhen Village had leakage holes. A certain unit joined the masses to rush to rescue them. Deputy Company Commander Huang and others jumped into the water to block the leak, and it was quickly blocked. On the 28th, a two-zhang-long breach occurred in the river embankment east of Batai Village. Our county and district cadres immediately mobilized laborers from five villages and blocked the breach in one and a half days and nights. Although there was an accident on the sluice gate of the Wenanwa drainage ditch on the night of the 28th, it was repaired by our cadres and the masses before dawn.

　　静海边沿区
  　军民武装护堤抢险
    【冀中电】静海等县边缘区军民，在武装掩护下积极修堤护险。静海某区干部及当地群众，三天中已堵好去年蒋匪在大清河扒开的十二个决口。并联合文新、胜芳群众，在富官营西清河堤的险工上培了土。子牙河岸李家湾子去年被蒋匪决口三处，七月十四日我军攻克该据点后，静海县府立时发动群众抢堵，在部队和武工队掩护下已经修好。但因水势很猛，二十八日又发现漏水洞。县区干部立即领导群众全力抢堵。独流蒋匪虽两次用机枪扫射扰乱破坏，但在我武装保护下终于堵好。子牙镇村南村北的堤岸，二十八日发生漫洞，某部便和群众一起抢险，黄副连长等并跳下水去堵漏洞，很快就堵好了。坝台村东的河堤二十八日开了两丈长的决口，我县区干部立时发动了五个村的民工，以一天半宿的工夫，将决口堵好。文安洼泄水沟的闸上，二十八日晚虽经出险，但在我干部群众抢修下，不到天明就修好了。
