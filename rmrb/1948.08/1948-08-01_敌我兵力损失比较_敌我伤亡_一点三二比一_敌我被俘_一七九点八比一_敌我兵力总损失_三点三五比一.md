    Comparison of Enemy and Our Military Losses
    Enemy and Our Casualties – 1.32 to 1
    Enemy Captured – 179.8 to 1
    Total Enemy and Our Military Losses – 3.35 to 1
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] The General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued the third public communique of the second year of the Liberation War from July 1, 1947, to June 30, 1948 - Comparison of enemy and our military losses is as follows:
    (1) Throughout the year, our army suffered 325,300 wounded, 82,300 killed in action, totaling 407,600 casualties; 5,300 were captured, and 40,000 were missing, totaling 452,900 military personnel lost. However, about three-quarters of the wounded recovered and returned to their units, so the number of losses should be reduced by about 240,000, with actual losses only about 212,900.
    (2) Throughout the year, our army killed or wounded 540,200 enemy troops, with the enemy and our casualties ratio being 1.32 to 1; throughout the year, 953,000 enemy troops were captured, with the enemy and our captured ratio being 179.8 to 1; throughout the year, a total of 1,521,400 enemy troops were eliminated, with the enemy and our military losses ratio being 3.35 to 1. However, the actual ratio should exceed this number, because the enemy's treatment after being wounded is poor, and desertion is serious, with very few recovering and returning to their units, while about three-quarters of our wounded can return to their units. Comparing the two, the ratio should be greater than 3.35 to 1.
    (3) In the first year of the Liberation War, our army suffered 336,000 casualties, 2,500 were captured, and 19,500 were missing, totaling 358,000, of which about 200,000 recovered and returned to their units. In the two years of the Liberation War, our army suffered 743,600 casualties, 7,800 were captured, and 59,500 were missing, totaling 810,900, of which about 440,000 recovered and returned to their units.
    (4) In the two years of the Liberation War, our army killed or wounded 966,200 enemy troops, with the enemy and our casualties ratio being 1.29 to 1; in the two years, our army captured 1,630,000 enemy troops, with the enemy and our captured ratio being 208 to 1; in the two years, our army eliminated 2,641,400 enemy troops, with the enemy and our military losses ratio being 3.25 to 1. If we remove the number of those who recovered and returned to their units on both sides, then the ratio of enemy and our losses should be greater than this number.
    (5) In the two years of the Liberation War, our army's casualties accounted for 91.7 percent of our total military losses, those captured accounted for 0.96 percent of the total losses, and those missing accounted for 7.34 percent of the total losses. Enemy casualties accounted for 36.5 percent of all enemy troops eliminated, those captured accounted for 61.7 percent of all enemy troops eliminated, and those who revolted accounted for 1.8 percent of all enemy troops eliminated. Most of the enemy's losses were captured, and most of the captured enemy troops (one-half to three-quarters) have joined our army. In addition, there are some who revolted and joined our army. Our army's replenishment is sufficient to offset all losses and more.

    敌我兵力损失比较
    敌我伤亡——一点三二比一
    敌我被俘——一七九点八比一
    敌我兵力总损失——三点三五比一
    【新华社陕北三十日电】中国人民解放军总部发表自一九四七年七月一日至一九四八年六月三十日解放战争第二年第三号公报——敌我兵力损失比较如下：
    （一）我军全年负伤三十二万五千三百人，阵亡八万二千三百人，伤亡共计四十万零七千六百人；被俘五千三百人，失踪四万人，总计我军损失兵力四十五万二千九百人。但负伤数中约四分之三伤愈归队，故损失数应减去约二十四万人，实际损失只约二十一万二千九百人。
    （二）我军全年毙伤敌军五十四万零二百人，敌我伤亡相较为一点三二比一；全年俘掳敌军九十五万三千人，敌我被俘相较为一七九点八比一；全年共消灭敌军一百五十二万一千四百人，敌我兵力损失相较为三点三五比一。但实际比率当超过此数，因敌军受伤后治疗既差，逃亡又重，伤愈归队者占极少数，而我军伤愈归队可达伤员四分之三，两相比较，比率当大过三点三五比一。
    （三）解放战争第一年我军伤亡共三十三万六千人，被俘二千五百人，失踪一万九千五百人，合计三十五万八千人，内伤愈归队者约二十万人。解放战争两年中，我军伤亡共七十四万三千六百人，被俘共七千八百人，失踪共五万九千五百人，合计八十一万零九百人，内伤愈归队者约四十四万人。
    （四）解放战争两年中，我共毙伤敌军九十六万六千二百人，敌我伤亡相较为一点二九比一；两年我共俘敌军一百六十三万人，敌我被俘相较为二零八比一；两年我共消灭敌军兵力二百六十四万一千四百人，敌我兵力损失相较为三点二五比一。若除去双方伤愈归队人数，则敌我损失比率，当大过此数。
    （五）解放战争两年中，我军伤亡为我军兵力总损失的百分之九十一点七，被俘为总损失的百分之零点九六，失踪为总损失的百分之七点三四。两年敌军伤亡为其被消灭兵力全部的百分之三十六点五，被俘为其被消灭兵力全部的百分之六十一点七，起义者为其被消灭兵力全部的百分之一点八。敌军损失中的大部分为被俘，而被俘敌军的大部分（二分之一至四分之三）又已加入我军，此外并有起义加入我军的部分，我军得此补充，即足以抵消全部损失而有余。
