Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: TASS, Moscow, July 29th: The Soviet Red Star newspaper wrote in an article titled "India After Partition" that the policies adopted by the governments of the two dominions of India after partition against the Indian nation are reviving the worst era of British colonial rule. The submission of the leaders of the National Congress and the Muslim League to Anglo-American pressure, and their preparation to conclude enslaving agreements with the United States, have aroused strong indignation among the broad masses of the people in the two dominions. The strike movement in the two dominions has not weakened. Peasant unrest is occurring in some areas. Within the Hyderabad State, this unrest has developed into armed conflict against government troops. Despite the suppression and persecution of democratic groups and progressive leaders, the working people of India and Pakistan continue to fight for genuine national independence and to realize all the most important demands of the people.

    印度人民顽强斗争
    罢工运动农民骚动不断发生
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社莫斯科七月二十九日讯：苏联红星报在题为“分治后的印度”一文中写道，分治后的印度两个自治领政府所采取的反对印度民族的政策，正在使英国殖民者统治的最恶劣时代复苏。国民大会及回教联盟领袖们屈服于英美压力之下，以及他们准备与美国缔结奴役协定，已激起两自治领内广大人民群众的强烈愤慨，两自治领内的罢工运动并未减弱。若干地区内正发生着农民骚动。在海德拉巴土邦之内，这些骚动已发展成为反对政府军的武装冲突。尽管民主团体及进步领袖遭受镇压与迫害，但印度与巴基斯坦的劳动人民，仍在为争取真正的民族独立，和实现人民一切极其重要的要求而继续斗争。
