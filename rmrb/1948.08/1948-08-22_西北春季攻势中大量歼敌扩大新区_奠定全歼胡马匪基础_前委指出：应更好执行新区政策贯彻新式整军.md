Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 20th—The Front Committee of the Northwest People's Liberation Army recently held an enlarged meeting to conduct detailed research and summarization of the Spring Offensive and current work. The meeting's summary first pointed out that the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated a large number of enemies during the Spring Offensive, glorified the democratic sacred land of Yan'an, and opened up vast new liberated areas in the Huanglong Mountain area and the Jingdi area. The Northwest Hu-Ma bandit army, after our repeated annihilation and annihilating blows, is now in a passive position, laying a solid foundation for our army to completely annihilate the Hu-Ma bandit gangs and liberate the Great Northwest. In the battles, the operational policies, troop work, and policies towards the new areas were all correctly implemented in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao in December of last year. Secondly, education should be universally carried out in the troops to make all commanders and fighters deeply understand that in the newly liberated areas, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, the experience of the Anti-Japanese War should be fully utilized to implement the social policy of rent reduction and interest reduction, appropriately adjusting seeds and rations, and the property policy of reasonable burden, step by step eliminating the feudal exploitation system, so as to accelerate the faster development of the People's Liberation War and the earlier equal distribution of land nationwide. Thirdly, after the test of war, it has been proven that our army's commanders and fighters possess excellent political qualities and a heroic and tenacious fighting style, have produced countless combat heroes and model workers, have created rich war experience, and have completed and will continue to complete all glorious and arduous tasks. However, there are still shortcomings, such as complacency after victory, which hinders progress; or feeling discouraged after temporary setbacks. These phenomena are all manifestations of political fragility, and even the smallest ones should be overcome immediately. Therefore, after victory, especially after a great victory, attention should be paid to reviewing shortcomings, even small shortcomings should be seriously reviewed. When temporarily frustrated, the subjective and objective reasons should be specifically analyzed, and the subjective reasons should be emphasized to seek improvement. The summary pointed out that the method of strict review and recommendation by the masses of headquarters and party members should continue to be adopted in the troops. During the winter training, the masses recommended nearly a thousand cadres and thousands of party members, the vast majority of whom were resolute, brave, competent, and outstanding elements. We should continue to boldly follow the mass line, give play to the creativity of the masses, and implement it in all aspects of political work, military work, and economic work. This method of military consolidation has repeatedly proven to be the most effective. Regarding military construction, it was pointed out that we must be good at using all time to make military training a regular mass movement. First of all, we must establish the view that everyone in the army is a soldier and everyone practices martial arts, and everyone must learn to use their own weapons, so that the entire army becomes a cohesive combat unit, improves combat skills, and repeatedly discusses Chairman Mao's Ten Military Principles, so that military practical experience is combined with theory.

　　西北春季攻势中大量歼敌扩大新区
  　奠定全歼胡马匪基础
    前委指出：应更好执行新区政策贯彻新式整军
    【新华社西北前线二十日电】西北人民解放军前线党委会，最近召开扩大会议，对春季攻势与目前工作，均作了详尽的研讨与总结。大会总结中首先指出：西北人民解放军在春季作战中大量的歼灭了敌人，光荣了民主圣地延安，开拓了黄龙山区和泾地地区的广大新解放区。西北胡马匪军经我历次歼灭及歼灭性的打击，已处于被动，奠定了我军全部歼灭胡马两匪军，解放大西北的强固基础。作战中，无论作战方针，部队工作，对新区的政策，均正确执行了中共中央和毛主席去年十二月的指示。其次在部队中应普遍的进行教育，使全体指战员深刻了解在新解放区，根据中央指示，充分利用抗日时期的经验，实行减租减息，酌量调剂种籽口粮的社会政策，和合理负担的财产政策，有步骤的消灭封建剥削制度，以加速人民解放战争更快的向前发展，与全国范围内的更早平分土地。再次，经过战争考验，证明我军指战员具备了优良的政治品质与英勇顽强的战斗作风，产生了无数的战斗英雄与模范工作者，创造了丰富的战争经验，完成了并将继续完成着一切光荣而艰巨的任务。但缺点还是有的，如胜利之后骄傲自满，妨碍进步；或者暂时受挫之后，表现气馁。这些现象都是政治上脆弱的表现，那怕是微小的都应立即克服。因此在胜利之后，尤其在大胜利之后，应注意检讨缺点，那怕是微小缺点，都应认真检讨。而当暂时受挫时，应具体分析主观客观原因，并着重的检讨主观原因都求改进。总结指出：经过群众严格审查推荐总部与党员的办法，在部队中应继续采用。去冬整训时，群众推荐出近千个干部数千个党员，绝大多数是坚决勇敢称职的优秀分子。应继续放手走群众路线，发挥群众创造性，贯彻到政治工作、军事工作、经济工作各方面去。这种整军方式，反复证明是最有效的办法。关于军事建设指出：我们必须善于利用一切时间，使练兵习武成为经常性的群众运动。首先必须确定全军中人人皆兵、人人习武的观点，每人都要学习使用自己的武器，使全军成为一个整体的战斗单位，提高战斗技术，反复讨论毛主席十大军事原则，使军事实际经验与理论结合起来。
