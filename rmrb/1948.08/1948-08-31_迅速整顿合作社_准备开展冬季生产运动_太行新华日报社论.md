Taihang Electric Dispatch: *Taihang Xinhua Daily* published an editorial entitled "Rapidly Rectify Cooperatives and Prepare for the Winter Production Campaign." Excerpts: In the past few years of production campaigns, the broad masses relied on cooperatives to develop sideline production and support agricultural production; they relied on them to organize production for self-relief and successfully overcome the great famine of 1943 and many subsequent local famines. Through years of experience, the masses have deeply felt the benefits and great role of cooperatives. Now that the landlord class in the Taihang area has been eliminated and land reform has been completed, the main task in the future is to carry out large-scale production campaigns. In this movement, cooperatives must play a greater role; first, rely on cooperatives to organize sideline production this winter. However, the "poor and hired peasant line" deviation in cooperatives in various places has not been completely eliminated, and many serious problems have not been resolved, causing many cooperatives to become detached from the masses, and even in danger of collapsing, which is very detrimental to carrying out production campaigns in the future. Therefore, rapidly rectifying cooperatives should become one of the most important tasks at present and must be started immediately. How to rectify? The editorial pointed out: (1) Correct the business direction of cooperatives, organize sideline production, and support agricultural production. All cooperatives that do not conform to organizing and supporting mass production should be rectified and transformed; cooperatives should obtain a certain profit in order to expand and share dividends, which is what the members of the public demand. But it must never be a simple pursuit of profits while ignoring the main task of supporting mass production. In order to correctly solve this problem, a general meeting of members should be convened to review the business activities of the cooperative, promote what is correct, correct what is wrong, and determine the direction: such as village cooperatives promoting the masses' produce, helping the masses obtain raw materials, and providing economic and business support to small cooperatives, etc. It must never be an excuse for "organization" to implement control and restrict the free production activities of the masses. For example, some places forcibly organize several independent handicraft workers with different characteristics together, or force certain handicraft laborers to participate in the cooperative for unified profit sharing, or control raw materials in certain handicraft areas, etc., all of which are wrong and hinder production, and must be thoroughly corrected. (2) Rectify the funds of cooperatives. The funds of many cooperatives cannot be recovered due to large amounts of external debt, which affects the turnover of funds and causes business to stagnate. Therefore, cooperatives must immediately clear up external debts and restore business activities. No matter who borrows money from the cooperative or owes the cooperative, they must find ways to repay it. Those who really cannot repay it must also repay it in installments or organize them to produce and repay the debt. The "relief viewpoint" in this regard is destructive to production and reactionary, and must be corrected. Secondly, some of the funds of the cooperative are undivided fruits. When using it to compensate middle peasants, adjust poor peasants, and resettle landlords and rich peasants in the land reform work, they can be given shares, but those who do not want to invest can withdraw. The shares of middle peasants wrongly confiscated and the shares of landlords and rich peasants should be returned during the correction of deviations, and they are welcome to continue to invest. Those who still do not want to invest after rectifying the business for the shares allocated in the past and other forced shares, can withdraw their shares freely. If the withdrawal of village funds that have been invested has too much impact, they can not be withdrawn, withdrawn slowly, or withdrawn in installments to maintain the continued operation of the cooperative. (3) Stipulate various systems of the cooperative, such as the share purchase and withdrawal system: ensure voluntary share purchase and free share withdrawal. Accounting system: ensure clear accounts and strict procedures. Loan and credit system: ensure that all loans are repaid and debts are repaid. Dividend system: ensure the same dividends for the same shares. The in-kind principal guarantee system should also be appropriately stipulated to ensure that the cooperative's funds do not gradually shrink due to dividends. The treatment system for cooperative staff: ensure that neither party suffers (the cooperative should preferably not catch fire) and an appropriate dividend system to give play to the enthusiasm of cooperative staff, etc. These systems shall be decided by the general meeting of members, and everyone shall abide by them. (4) Rectify the leadership of the cooperative. In addition to holding regular meetings of members, it is best to organize a board of directors to regularly check and lead the work of the cooperative. Those with unclear cooperative accounts should be cleared up, and those with corrupt behavior should be investigated and resolved. Cooperative personnel who are incompetent, "poor and hired peasants in power" but have no management ability should be re-elected. Those who provide services to the masses free of charge should be appropriately resolved according to the circumstances and solicit their opinions. Those who remain in office must maintain a proper relationship and cannot be free of charge. The number of service personnel should be reduced if there are too many. The editorial finally pointed out: In the way of rectifying cooperatives, the administrative order of dissolution cannot be used, but rather the masses should be led to rectify, transform, review the past, determine the direction, help and organize mass production, and first do a good job in this year's winter production. Responsible comrades in each county must personally get started, organize cooperative committees, strengthen the leadership of this work, and ensure that it is completed in a timely manner.

### 迅速整顿合作社　准备开展冬季生产运动——太行新华日报社论

　　迅速整顿合作社
  　准备开展冬季生产运动
    ——太行新华日报社论
    【太行电】太行新华日报以“迅速整顿合作社，开展冬季生产运动”为题发表社论。略称：在过去几年的生产运动中，广大群众曾依靠合作社发展副业生产，扶助了农业生产；依靠它组织过生产自救，胜利的渡过了四三年的大灾荒以及以后的很多局部灾荒。群众在多年的经验中，已经深深的感受到合作社的好处和它的巨大作用。现在太行区地主阶级已经消灭，土改已经完成，今后的任务主要就是开展大生产运动。在这一运动中，合作社必须发挥更大的作用；首先是依靠合作社来组织今冬副业生产。可是现在各地合作社中“贫雇路线”的偏向尚未彻底肃清，许多严重的问题尚未解决，使很多合作社脱离群众，甚至有垮台的危险，这对今后开展生产运动是十分不利的。因此，迅速整顿合作社应该成为当前最重要的任务之一，必须立即着手进行。如何整顿呢？社论指出：（一）端正合作社的业务方针，组织副业生产，扶助农业生产。凡不符合组织与扶助群众生产的合作社，都应该加以整顿改造；合作社要获得一定的利润以便扩大与分红，这是社员群众所要求的。但绝不能单纯追求利润而忽视扶助群众生产的主要任务。为了正确的解决这一问题，应该召开社员大会，检讨合作社的业务活动，发扬对的，纠正错的，确定方针：如村社推销群众的生产物，帮助群众取得原料，对小型合作社予以经济上业务上的支援等等。绝不能借口“组织”，实行统制，限制群众自由的生产活动。例如有些地方把若干性质不同的独立手工业者强制组织在一起，或强制某些手工业劳动者参加合作社统一分红，在某些手工业区域统制原料等等，这都是错误的，妨碍生产的，必须彻底纠正。（二）整顿合作社的资金。许多合作社的资金，因大量外欠收不回来，影响资金无法周转，业务陷于停顿。因此合作社必须马上清理外欠，恢复业务活动。不论什么人借合作社的钱，赊合作社的帐，都必须设法归还。实在还不起的，也必须分期归还，或组织他们生产还帐。在这方面的“救济观点”是破坏生产的，反动的，必须加以纠正。其次，合作社有的资金是未分的果实，在结束土改工作中用它进行补偿中农，调剂贫农，安置地富时，可以给他们股票，但不愿入股者可以抽出。没收错斗中农的股金、地富的股金，应该在纠偏时退还，并欢迎他们继续入股。过去摊派的股金及其他强迫加入的股金，在整顿业务后仍不愿入股者，抽股自由。入股的村款因抽出影响太大时，可不抽、缓抽或分期抽，以维持合作社的继续经营。（三）规定合作社的各种制度，如入股抽股制度：保证入股自愿，抽股自由。会计制度：保证帐目清楚，手续严格。借钱赊帐制度：保证有借必还，赊帐还帐。分红制度：保证同样股金同样分红。实物保本制度也应适当规定，以保证合作社资金不因分红而日渐缩小。合作社工作人员的待遇制度：保证两不吃亏（合作社最好不起火）及适当分红制，以发挥合作社工作人员的积极性等。这些制度由社员大会议定，任何人都应当遵守。（四）整顿合作社的领导，除定期召开社员大会外，最好组织董事会，经常检查领导合作社的工作。合作社帐目不清者应该清理，有贪污行为者应该查究解决。合作社人员不称职、“贫雇掌权”但毫无经营能力者，应该改选。无代价为群众服务者，应分别情况并征求本人意见适当解决。留职的必须保持正当关系，不能是无偿的。服务人员过多者应该减少。社论最后指出：在整顿合作社的方式上，不能用行政命令的解散方式，而应该是领导群众整顿改造检讨过去，确定方针，帮助与组织群众生产，首先是搞好今年冬季生产。各县负责同志必须亲自动手、组织合作委员会，加强这一工作的领导，并保证及时完成。
