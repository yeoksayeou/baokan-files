　　Advancing While Learning
  　Many Shortcomings Still Require Effort
    [This newspaper reported] The Directly Subordinate Party Committee of the Joint Organs of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Administrative Committee re-examined the progress of the ten-day study of the Four Great Documents on the 17th of this month. According to a comrade from the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau who attended the meeting, the learning in some of their units has taken a step forward, with the practice of reading and discussing every morning being maintained. Many departments have put forward opinions on improving the work of the organs. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in conjunction with the study of "Taking Agricultural Production in the Liberated Areas a Step Higher," studied the steps and methods for improving technology, reviewed the lack of seriousness in implementing government decrees, the lack of definite instructions and opinions, the inconsistency between higher and lower levels, the lack of sufficient investigation and research, and the lack of timely solutions to problems for lower levels, etc. The Ministry of Civil Affairs put forward how to realize the three-level people's congress, train district and village cadres, methods of cultivation on behalf of others, etc. A comrade from the Propaganda Department pointed out that it is good to actively put forward opinions, but the scope of the proposals is too broad, lacking focus, and some departments are holding on to the attitude of giving opinions to the higher authorities and waiting for the work to be improved, without focusing on reviewing the current work of their own departments and improving it based on the current foundation and conditions. Some units have studied well, established systems, and achieved results, such as the Secretariat and the Management Section, which focused on examining their own work. In order to improve the food for patients, they held a meeting of patient representatives and specifically determined improvement methods. The work of medical personnel has made significant progress, but the chaotic situation has not been eradicated, and expenses are being blindly spent. Medical expenses were overspent by more than two hundred yuan last month. There are also individual departments that regard learning as a burden, and meetings are like handing over official business, such as the North China Trading Company and the bank, which only raised a few questions temporarily. The level of learning is still stuck in an unorganized and unsystematic state, failing to unify learning with work. All of these must continue to be overcome.

### 边直学习前进一步　缺点尚多仍须努力

　　边直学习前进一步
  　缺点尚多仍须努力
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边府与晋察冀行委会两机关之直属党委会，于本月十七日再次检查十天学习四大文件之进行程度。据华北局宣传部出席该会议之同志称：他们的学习有些单位是前进了一步，坚持了每天早晨的阅读与讨论，许多部门提出了改进机关工作的意见。农林部结合着“把解放区农业生产提高一步”的学习，研究了提高技术的步骤与方法，检讨了不去政府下达法令不严肃，指示意见不肯定，上下不一致，调查研究不够，对下级及时解决问题不够等等。民政部提出如何实现三级人代会，训练区村干部，代耕办法等等。宣传部同志指出积极提出意见是好的，但提的面太宽，无心，还有些部门抱着给上边提意见，等着改进工作的态度，没有着重检讨本部门现在的工作，就现在的基础和条件加以改进。有的单位学习较好，定出了制度，并且收到了效果，如秘书处、管理股，着重的检查了本身工作，为改善病号饭，召开了病号代表会议，具体确定了改进办法。医务的工作人显著进步，但混乱现象仍未根绝，经费盲目开支，医药费上个月亏了二百多块。还有个别部门以学习为负担，开会如同交代公事，如华北贸易总公司、银行，临时提了几个问题就算了，学习水平还停留在无组织无制度的状态，未把学习与工作统一起来。这些都须继续克服。
