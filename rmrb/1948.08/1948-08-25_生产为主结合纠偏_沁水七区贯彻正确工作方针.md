　　Focusing on Production Combined with Rectification
  　Qingshui Seventh District Implements Correct Working Principles
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Qingshui District work team has corrected the state of disorganization and lack of discipline, and resolutely implemented the principle of focusing on production while carrying out rectification. When the district inspected the work of each work team on August 1, it found that most teams still focused on leading rectification, with production leadership as an afterthought, or even not leading or opposing production leadership at all. They did not understand that rectification was also for the sake of production, resulting in laissez-faire production throughout the district, and even land abandonment in some villages. Even good land was left uncultivated in Hegu Village, and more than 150 mu of autumn seedlings in Houhe Village had not been hoed even once. The reason for this phenomenon, as some comrades said during their self-criticism, was: "They suffered from an acute illness, wanting to correct the deviations all at once, so they relaxed their leadership of production." At the same time, some cadres were ideologically confused, unwilling to work, some wanted to go home, some were afraid of being transferred far away, and some were afraid of taking responsibility. Ni Xuexin went home five times in just over three months, missing fifteen days, and had no more desire to work. When he saw team leader Wang Jinyi leading the masses in hoeing seedlings, he was still dissatisfied, saying, "We are here to rectify deviations, not to hoe the ground. If we wanted to hoe the ground, we might as well go home and hoe." Exposing these phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline, the district led everyone to study the sections on party constitution and discipline, as well as the reprinting of "Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder and other documents. Through study and self-criticism, they further clarified the correctness of the instruction to focus on production while carrying out rectification, and were determined to immediately correct certain states of disorganization and lack of discipline in their daily work. Ni Xuexin said: "I was irresponsible in my work in the previous period, only thinking about going home, which was wrong. I will concentrate on my work in the future and lead the masses in production." Other comrades also exposed their erroneous thoughts one by one and expressed their determination to correct them. Finally, the specific work for the present was determined: (1) For the fifteen villages such as Nancun and Haize, which have already hoed the seedlings twice, efforts should be made to hoe them a third time. (2) Strive to plow the wheat fields three times, and make a lot of fertilizer, so that each mu of land is fertilized with thirty to fifty dan. (3) Start by rectifying mutual aid teams. Comrades from each work team should personally go deep into understanding the situation, correct problems in a timely manner, cultivate mutual aid leadership backbones, settle accounts of previous work, organize, and ensure the realization of the above plans. (4) In villages where rectification is not thorough, focus on production and continue to solve remaining problems. This should be completed by the end of August.

　　生产为主结合纠偏
  　沁水七区贯彻正确工作方针
    【太岳电】沁水区工作组，纠正无组织无纪律状态，坚决执行以生产为主贯彻纠偏的方针。该区八月一日检查各工作组的工作时，发现大部仍以领导纠偏为主，附带领导生产，甚至有的根本不领导成反对领导生产，而不了解纠偏也是为了生产，致使全区生产自流，部分村庄甚至荒了土地。和沟村连好地也荒了，后河村有一百五十多亩秋苗还没锄过头遍。发生这种现象的原因，正如有些同志检查思想时说：“犯了急性病，想一下把偏纠过来，所以放松了领导生产。”同时有些干部思想混乱，不安心工作，有的想回家，有的害怕远调，有的怕负责任。倪学信三月多就回了五次家，误了十五天，再没心思工作。看到组长王锦仪同志领导群众锄苗时，心里还不满意，说“咱们是来纠偏，又不是来锄地，要锄地还不如回家去锄。”暴露了这些无组织无纪律的现象，区上就领导大家学习党章纪律部分及重印左派幼稚病等文件。经过学习检讨，进一步明确认识了以生产为主贯彻纠偏指示的正确性，决心立即纠正日常工作中的某些无组织无纪律状态。倪学信说：“我前一段工作不负责任，光想回家，这是错误的，今后要安心工作，领导群众生产。”其他同志也都一一揭发了自己的错误思想，并表示坚决改正。最后确定目前的具体工作：（一）已经锄完二遍苗的南村、海则等十五村，应大力争取锄三遍。（二）麦地争取犁三遍，并大量造肥，作到每亩上粪三十担到五十担。（三）先从整顿互助组入手，每个工作组同志要亲自深入了解情况，及时纠正毛病，培养互助领导骨干，清算前后工帐，组织起来，保证上面计划的实现。（四）纠偏不彻底的村庄以生产为主，继续解决遗留问题。大体于八月底做完。
