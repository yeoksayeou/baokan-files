In 1919, he entered the Social Democratic Newspaper and later became the editor-in-chief. He was imprisoned for political activities. During the war, he led underground activities. After the war, he was elected as the General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, leading the purge of the right-wing elements of the party, and advocating the merger with the Hungarian Communist Party.
