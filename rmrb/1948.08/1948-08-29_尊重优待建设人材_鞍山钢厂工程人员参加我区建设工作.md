　　Respect and Give Preferential Treatment to Talented Personnel in Construction
  　Engineering Personnel from Anshan Steel Plant Participate in Construction Work in Our Region
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th] After the liberation of the famous "Steel Capital," Anshan, more than 170 technical personnel from the former Anshan Iron and Steel Company received protection and care from the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government. Among them, Peng Ronggui, the former director and engineer of the Machinery Repair Factory, engineer Ma Xi＠, deputy engineer Yang Shusen, assistant engineer Zeng Jietie, and engineer Yi Gaichen, along with 23 others, soon participated in the production and construction work of the new Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, holding positions such as factory director, engineer, and engineer. Due to the severe damage to Anshan by the Kuomintang bandit troops, it was temporarily difficult to fully resume work in the mines and factories. Therefore, some experts and technical personnel have not yet directly participated in production work, but they are undertaking the task of cultivating new construction talents for the liberated areas. Engineer Yang Zhengu and Lei Tianzhuang are currently the director and deputy director of the "Technical Research Institute," mainly training personnel in physical and chemical engineering. Some people are teaching in the "Mechanical Training Class." In addition, they have also been appointed to teach at the "Natural Science Research Institute," which is currently being planned.
    When the reporter visited the newly appointed factory director Peng Ronggui, he was studying the second phase of the factory's construction plan. Half a month ago, this place was still a pile of rubble. Now, not only has a new factory been established, but finished products have already been produced. Factory Director Peng said with confidence: "We have gone from having nothing to having something, from lacking to being complete. We will definitely grow from small to large, from few to many in the future." He excitedly said: "We worked in the Kuomintang area for many years, and we all had the ideal of building production and developing national wealth, but in the Kuomintang area, this goal could not be achieved. Today, in the liberated area, we have truly seen the bright future of New China's construction, and our ideals can be realized."
    Factory Director Peng is from Lingshou, Hebei. He graduated from the Mechanical Department of the Japanese Railway Ministry's Technical School and once served as a professor at various universities in Beiping. In May 1946, he came to the Northeast and served as a special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Kuomintang government in the Northeast, eventually taking over as the director of the Anshan Machinery Repair Factory. On the second day of Anshan's liberation, the People's Liberation Army discovered that he was an engineer and immediately took care of him warmly, entrusting him to convene workers and continue to manage and rectify the factory. Peng emphasized to the reporter: "This is really something I didn't expect. The Kuomintang spread rumors that if you were caught by the People's Liberation Army, you wouldn't survive. But my personal experience completely shattered this rumor."
    When the reporter met Yang Zhengu and Lei Dazhuang, the director and deputy director of the Technical Research Institute, orderlies were helping them move into a newly painted building. Director Yang graduated from Tianjin Beiyang University and has worked in famous mines and factories in Jingxing, Hebei, Chongqing, and Hanoi for more than ten years. Before the liberation of Anshan, he was the senior engineer and director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He specializes in steel engineering and testing. He had the same feeling as Factory Director Peng. He said to the reporter with emotion: "In the past, I also wanted to build wealth for the country and the people, but I gradually realized that this was impossible in the Chiang-controlled area. Working there was just about making a living." He also complained that even making a living was not easy, saying: "Our lives were difficult to maintain. In such cold weather in the Northeast, I only had a tattered overcoat. The workers' lives were even more difficult, of course."
    Deputy Director Lei Tianzhuang, when visiting an industrial site in a certain liberated area, was amazed that the area could spin 22-count yarn under various difficult conditions. He has read and understood many books and documents from the liberated areas and greatly admires the firm implementation of policies and the effectiveness of the liberated areas. He cited the example of a certain place resolutely correcting errors in land reform that infringed upon industry and commerce, saying: "This spirit of daring to correct mistakes shows that the Communist Party will definitely win." Deputy Director Lei is from Hunan and graduated from Peking University. In 1945, he interned at a refractory materials factory in the United States. After returning to China in 1946, he served as an engineer at the Anshan Steel Plant and director of the Refractory Materials Plant.
    The more than 170 technical personnel who participated in the construction work in the liberated area included six assistant managers of the original Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Anshan Iron and Steel Company had six assistant managers in addition to the general manager, and the assistant managers also served as directors of various departments), one chief engineer, seven engineers who also served as factory directors, department directors, etc., nineteen senior engineers and engineers, fourteen deputy engineers and assistant engineers, and forty-six engineers and assistant engineers. Among them, twenty-two were engaged in metallurgical engineering, fourteen in chemical engineering, five in mining engineering, and fifteen in mechanical engineering. Eighteen graduated from universities in Germany, England, the United States, and Japan, and forty-six graduated from universities in China. Among them, there are many famous experts. In addition to Peng Ronggui, Yang Zhengu, and Lei Tianzhuang, there is also Li Enye, who holds a doctorate in chemical engineering from the Berlin University of Technology in Germany and was the chief engineer and deputy director of the Chemical Engineering Institute of the North Mining Tar Factory of the Kuomintang Resources Committee. Mao Henian graduated from Purdue University in the United States and has served as an engineer at the Kunming Electrical Equipment Factory, a professor at Chongqing University, and an assistant manager and director of the Power Institute at Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Li Songtang graduated from Tongji University and was an assistant manager and director of the Rolling Mill Institute at Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Ma Xi＠ graduated from the Department of Metallurgy at Tokyo Imperial University and served as an engineer at the Hunan Ordnance Department and the director of the Manufacturing Institute of the Chongqing Ordnance Department. Zhang Shubao graduated from Zhejiang University and served as a deputy engineer at the Yunnan Iron and Steel Plant and a commissioner of the Kuomintang Northeast Benxi Coal and Iron Company. They are now all respected and treated preferentially by the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government, and their living standards are more than twice that of ordinary government cadres.

　　尊重优待建设人材
  　鞍山钢厂工程人员参加我区建设工作
    【新华社东北二十鞍日电】著名“钢都”军山解放后，受到解放军及民主政府多方保护与照顾的一百七十多位原鞍山钢铁公司的技术人员，其中原机器修造厂厂长兼工程师彭荣桂、工程师马希＠、副工程师杨树森、助理工程师曾介铁、工务员伊盖臣等二十八人，不久就参加了新的鞍山钢铁厂的生产建设工作，担任着厂长、工程师、工务员等职务。由于国民党匪军对鞍山的严重破坏，矿厂一时尚难全部复工，因此一部分专家和技术人员还没有直接参加生产工作，但他们担负了为解放区培养新的建设人材的工作。工程师杨振古、雷天壮现任“技术研究所”正副主任，主要是培养理化工程人员。有一部分人在“机械训练班”任教。此外正筹备的“自然科学研究院”亦已约定他们任教。
    当记者访问新任厂长彭荣桂时，他正在研究工厂的第二步建设计划。半个月前，这里还是一片瓦砾。现在不仅建立新厂，并已出产成品。彭厂长满怀信心地说：“我们是从没有变成有，从缺乏变成完整，我们今后一定会由小变大，由少变多。”他兴奋地说：“我们在国民党区干了好多年，我们都有建设生产发展国家财富的理想，可是在国民党区这个目的是达不到的。今天在解放区才真正看到了新中国建设的光明前途，我们的理想可以实现了。”
    彭厂长是河北灵寿人，日本铁道省铁专机械科毕业，曾任北平各大学教授，一九四六年五月来东北，任国民党政府经济部东北特派员，最后接任鞍山机器修造厂厂长。鞍山解放的第二天，解放军发现他是一位工程师，当即热诚照顾，并即委托他召集工人，继续管理和整顿工厂。彭加重语气的向记者说：“这真是我想不到的，国民党造谣说：给解放军抓住就没有活命，可是我亲身的经验，完全打破了这个谣言。”
    当记者见到技术研究所的杨振古和雷大壮主任时，勤务员正帮他们搬进一座新粉刷过的楼房。杨主任毕业于天津北洋大学，十余年来先后在河北井陉、重庆以及河内等著名矿厂任职，鞍山解放前，任鞍山钢铁公司技正工程师兼所长。他特长于钢铁工程与化验。他和彭厂长有同样的感觉，他对记者感慨的说：“过去我也曾想为国家为人民建设财富，但我渐渐明白这些在蒋管区是做不到的，在那里工作只能是混饭吃而已。”他并诉说就是混饭吃也颇为不易，他说：“我们的生活都是难以维持的，在东北这样冷的天气，我就只是一件破大衣。工人生活当然更是困难了。”
    雷天壮副主任在参观解放区某地的工业时，曾惊赞该地在各种困难条件下，竟能纺出二十二支纱。他已阅读了解放区的很多书籍和文件，对于解放区坚决执行政策和实行的效果非常赞佩。他以某地坚决纠正土地改革中侵犯工商业的错误为例说：“这种勇于改过的精神，说明共产党一定胜利。”雷副主任是湖南人，北京大学毕业，一九四五年曾在美国耐火材料工厂实习。一九四六年回国后任鞍山炼钢厂工程师兼耐火材料厂厂长。
    参加解放区建设工作的这一百七十多位技术人员中，包括原鞍山钢铁公司协理员六人（按鞍山钢铁公司除总经理外共有协理员六人，协理员均兼所长），总工程师一人，工程师兼厂长、所长、处长等者七人，技正工程师、工程师十九人，副工程师、助理工程师十四人、工务员、助理工务员四十六人。其中从事冶金工程者二十二人，化学工程者十四人、采矿工程者五人，机械工程者十五人。在德、英、美、日各大学毕业者十八人，在国内各大学毕业者四十六人。其中并有许多著名的专家。除彭荣桂、杨振古、雷天壮外，如李恩业氏，是德国柏林工业大学化工博士，原任国民党资源委员会北矿焦油厂总工程师兼化工所副所长。毛鹤年氏是美国普渡大学研究院毕业，历任昆明电工器材厂工程师、重庆大学教授、鞍山钢铁公司协理员兼动力所长。李松堂氏，同济大学毕业，鞍山钢铁公司协理员兼轧钢所所长。马希＠氏，日本帝大冶金系毕业，曾任湖南兵工署工程师，重庆兵工署制造所主任。张书宝氏，浙江大学毕业，曾任云南钢铁厂副工程师，国民党东北本溪煤铁公司专员。他们现在都受到解放军及民主政府的尊重和优待，生活待遇超过一般机关干部的两倍以上。
