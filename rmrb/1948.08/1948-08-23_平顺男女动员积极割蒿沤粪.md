　　【Taihang News】After Pingshun County completed its work of hoeing seedlings and replanting, it successively shifted to the movement of cutting artemisia and accumulating fertilizer. Shangzhuang Village in the first district set a plan for cutting artemisia on July 24th, requiring the entire village to complete 263,600 jin. By the evening of the 28th, statistics at the people's school showed that 84 people had cut a total of 78,400 jin of artemisia in five days, completing 30% of the original plan. 68 people from Chuandi Village participated in cutting artemisia, with each person cutting two to three bundles (each bundle weighing about 80 jin) per day. In Wanglou group of Sitou Village in the sixth district, all 12 members of the group cut an average of 250 jin of artemisia per person per day. The masses' enthusiasm for green manure application has been unprecedentedly heightened. Zhao Tongmao from Shangzhuang Village said: "Skillful work is not as good as applying manure diligently. Although the land wasn't well managed this year, there is no shortage of rain, and the artemisia grows very well. As long as we seize the opportunity to cut artemisia and compost manure, we can make up for this deficiency." In Changli Village in the fifth district, the branch secretary, village chief, and other cadres mobilized everyone to cut artemisia and accumulate fertilizer. After hearing the call for green manure application, Niu Laisuo quickly hoeed the autumn seedlings for the second time, turned over the wheat fields, and went up the mountain with his son Niu Zhensheng to cut artemisia. In ten days, they cut more than 2,000 jin of artemisia, enough for four mu of wheat fields. Wang Cangze, an old man in his sixties, also cut 300 to 400 jin of artemisia in his spare time. Niu Suiliu, a military dependent in Shangzhuang Village, proposed to cut 800 jin of artemisia because her wheat field lacked fertilizer. Zhao Fujia, the village civil affairs commissioner, said: "Go ahead and cut it, I will be responsible for sending someone to carry it back for you." On the 28th, she cut more than 200 jin in one day.

　　平顺男女动员积极割蒿沤粪
    【太行讯】平顺全县于锄苗补种工作全部完成后，先后转向割蒿积肥运动，一区上庄村于七月二十四日订出割蒿计划，全村要完成二十六万三千六百斤。至二十八日晚上，在民校统计，八十四个人五天内共割蒿七万八千四百斤，已完成原计划的百分之三十。川底村参加割蒿共六十八人，每人每天割蒿两捆至三捆（每捆八十斤左右）。六区寺头村王楼则组，全组十二人，每人每天平均割蒿二百五十斤。群众的压绿肥情绪空前提高，上庄村赵同毛说：“巧作不如拙上粪，今年土地虽没有做好，但雨水不缺，蒿草长的很好，咱们只要抓紧机会割蒿沤粪，足能补起这个窟窿。”五区常里村，支部书记、村长等干部动员大家割蒿积肥，牛来锁听了压绿肥号召后，赶快把秋苗锄完二遍，麦地垡完，和他的儿子牛振声上山割蒿，十来天割蒿两千多斤，足够上四亩麦地用。六十余岁的王苍则老汉，抽空也割蒿三、四百斤。上庄村军属牛碎刘，因为麦地没有肥料，她自己提出割蒿八百斤，该村民事委员赵富家说：“你割吧，我负责派人给你担回来。”她二十八日一天就割了二百多斤。（王长锁、杨海忠、健武、进喜等）
