Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 30th – A frontline reporter reports on the annihilation of the Yan bandit Zhao Chengshou army group. Zhao Chengshou, the Deputy Director of the Yan Bandit Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Shanxi Field Army, led enemy troops, including the 33rd Army and the puppet-Japanese mixed Provisional 10th Army Corps, south along the Tongpu Railway, attempting to plunder grain. They were fiercely attacked by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as soon as they reached the Qixian and Pingyao areas. Zhao's troops immediately retreated, but were surrounded by the PLA on the border of Taigu and Xugou. From July 9th, Zhao Chengshou desperately tried to escape. At 8:00 AM that morning, they broke out towards the southwest, at noon they broke out towards the north, and at 5:00 PM they recklessly attempted to break out in the direction of Dongyang Town (about thirty li southeast of Yuci), but they were never able to escape the PLA's net. The PLA's pocket encirclement only grew tighter. On the 10th, a unit of the PLA captured Dongxi Jia Village (about twenty li west of Yuci); another unit eliminated the majority of the Provisional 44th Division and the puppet-Japanese mixed 10th Army Corps in Liqing Nanzhuang. On the 11th, after the encirclement and annihilation battle of Dachang Town, the main force of the 34th Army, the 73rd Division, was completely annihilated, and the army commander Gao Zhuozhi was wounded and fled. At this time, chaos erupted within the Yan army. Zhao's confidant, Han Chunsheng, the commander of the 71st Division, also complained about Zhao's command, saying: "Defending everywhere, weak everywhere, unable to connect points, unable to connect lines, not even resembling a defense."

Zhao Chengshou finally decided to break out at 9:00 PM on the 15th, but the PLA launched a general offensive an hour and a half before his planned breakout time. On a 400-meter-wide front, hundreds of light and heavy artillery pieces of the PLA concentrated their fire, and in just half an hour, they broke through the outer defense line of the three canals of Fancun. The assault and explosion team also occupied the Xiaomiao position on the forward edge of the northwest of the village, completely disrupting the enemy's breakout plan. Then, the PLA's second charge broke into the village. At this time, Zhao Chengshou actually ordered the release of poison gas. The first and second companies of a PLA unit, including the battalion and company commanders, were all poisoned, but the unit continued to stubbornly charge, breaking into the position. At the same time, friendly neighboring units also compressed the enemy, destroying the headquarters of the Provisional 44th Division, killing the division commander Lu Hongen. The former Japanese 14th Brigade commander and deputy commander of the Yan bandit Shanxi Field Army, Yuan Quanfu (also known as Yuan Quanxing), was also killed by our heavy artillery fire. Zhao Chengshou then led the remaining enemies in a panic escape from the west to Xiaochang Village. More than 10,000 people were concentrated in one village, filled with panic, hunger, and exhaustion, completely losing their fighting spirit; officers and soldiers threw away their weapons and fled in all directions. At this time, Zhao Chengshou still fantasized about posting slogans and announcements everywhere, saying that many planes were coming to assist in the battle, but the soldiers no longer believed this deception.

At 3:00 PM on the 16th, Zhao Chengshou attempted to break out again, but before he could escape the village, he was intercepted by our army in the southwest direction. Our army then pushed the enemy back into the village; another unit of our army controlled the T-junction in the southeast of the village. The assault team led by Battalion Commander Chang Xinping advanced directly to the front of Zhao Chengshou's headquarters. The enemies who retreated from the southeast street breakout were overwhelmed by the machine gun fire at the T-junction and swarmed back. The enemies pushed over, squeezed over, people shouted, horses neighed, officers could not find soldiers, battalion commanders could not find regimental commanders, mixed into a团 [tuán; unit, group], and were forced by our army into the houses in groups and laid down their weapons.

At this time, in front of Zhao Chengshou's headquarters, an adjutant appeared, carrying a white flag, approached Battalion Commander Chang Xinping of our army and shouted: "Here are our army group headquarters, army headquarters, division headquarters. Commander-in-chief Zhao has decided not to fight anymore and is willing to lay down his weapons." Then, Zhao Chengshou's headquarters Chief of Staff Yang Encheng and Zhao Chengshou himself came out one after another and formally surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 29th – The Yan bandit 43rd Army and other units that abandoned the cities and fled from Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Jiexiu, and Wenshui counties were intercepted and pursued by the PLA along the way, and were utterly defeated. Various weapons and the personal belongings carried by the officers' concubines were abandoned all over the ground. The Yan army officers and soldiers in retreat completely lost their fighting spirit. As soon as our army shouted to them, they laid down their weapons one after another. Our non-armed personnel also captured prisoners in batches. Commissioner Mi of the Eighth Administrative Office, because the highway passed through Fenyang and Wenshui, captured more than 40 Yan soldiers along the way, and seized more than 20 rifles and a cart of ammunition. Wu Gang, a reporter from the Jinzhong Branch of this agency, and two others also captured 37 Yan soldiers below the rank of platoon leader, and seized one infantry gun, one light gun, and more than ten rifles.

    解放军袋形包围越围越紧
    赵承绶逃不出去俯首投降
    前线记者报导阎匪赵集团被歼经过
    【新华社晋中前线三十日电】前线记者报导阎匪赵承绶集团军被歼经过。阎匪太原绥署副主任兼山西野战军总司令赵承绶，率敌三十三军及日伪混编的暂编陆军第十总队等部沿同蒲路南下，企图大肆抢粮，刚到祁县、平遥地区，就遭解放军的痛击。赵部立即收兵回窜，但只跑到太谷、徐沟边境，就被解放军包围住了。从七月九日起，赵承绶即拼命夺路逃窜，该日上午八时，向西南方向突围，中午向北面突围，下午五时又向东阳镇（榆次东南三十余里）方向乱碰，但始终无法突出解放军的罗网，而解放军的袋形包围，却越围越紧了。十日，某部解放军攻占东西贾村（榆次西二十余里）；另部在李青南庄解决了暂编四十四师和日伪混编的第十总队大部。十一日，又经过大常镇的围歼战，三十四军主力七十三师全部被歼，军长高卓之负伤潜逃。此时阎军内部发生混乱。赵的亲信七十一师师长韩春生也埋怨赵的指挥说：“处处防守，处处薄弱，点不成点，线不成线，连守也不象守的架子。”
    赵承绶最后又决定于十五日下午九时突围，而解放军却在他预定突围时间前一个半小时开始了总攻。在四百公尺宽的正面，解放军的百余门轻重炮集中轰击着，只半个钟头，就突破了范村三道水渠的外围防线。突击爆炸组并攻占了村西北前沿缺口小庙阵地，完全打乱了敌人突围部署。接着解放军第二次的冲锋就突进了村里。这时，赵承绶竟命令施放毒气。解放军某部一、二两连及营连长全部中毒，但该部仍继续顽强冲锋，突入阵地。同时，友邻部队也向敌压缩，击毁暂四十四师师部，毙该师师长卢鸿恩，阎匪山西野战军副总司令前日寇十四旅团长元全福（即元泉馨），也被我重炮轰毙。赵承绶乃率残敌从西面狼狈潜逃到小常村。一万多人集中在一个村里，恐慌、饥饿、疲困，完全丧失了斗志；官兵纷纷丢掉武器，四处逃生。这时赵承绶还异想天开的到处张贴标语布告，说有多少飞机要来助战，但士兵已再不信这一套欺骗了。
    十六日下午三时，赵承绶企图再次突围，但还没逃出村，便在西南方向被我军截住去路。我军并即将敌压回村里去；另部我军则控制了村东南丁字街口。常心平营长率领的突击队，直逼进赵承绶的总部门前。从东南街突围溃退下来的敌人，被丁字街口我机枪火力压倒，又蜂拥退回去。敌人拥过来，挤过去，人喊马叫，官找不到兵，营长找不到团长，混成一团，一群一群的被我军逼进屋子放下了武器。
    就在这个时候，在赵承绶某部门前，出现了一个副官，带着一面白旗，走近我军常心平营长跟前叫喊：“这里有我们集团军总部、军部、师部。赵总司令决心不打了，愿意放下武器。”接着赵承绶总部参谋长杨恩诚和赵承绶本人便先后走了出来，正式向解放军投降。
    【新华社晋中前线二十九日电】汾阳、孝义、介休、文水等县弃城逃窜的阎匪四十三军等部，沿路遭解放军拦击追击，溃不成军，各种武器及军官姨太太携带的细软被物遗弃满地。溃退中的阎军官兵，完全丧失斗志，一经我军喊话，即纷纷放下武器。我非武装人员，也成批地捉到俘虏。八专署米专员，因公路经汾阳、文水，沿途即俘获阎军四十余人，缴步枪二十余支，子弹一大车。本社晋中分社记者吴钢等三人，亦俘阎军排长以下三十七人，并缴步兵炮、轻炮各一门，轻机枪二挺，步枪十余支。
