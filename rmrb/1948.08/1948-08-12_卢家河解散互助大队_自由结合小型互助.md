[Taiyue Electric] Yangcheng Lujiahe dissolved its formalistic mutual aid brigade and reorganized into voluntary and flexible small organizations. The masses said it was convenient, and production enthusiasm increased. The Lujiahe mutual aid team was one of the "famous" Shangguan Zhongyou five-village joint mutual aid brigades in the past. The entire village of sixty-four households was divided into three large groups, and women were also assigned to three large groups along with the men. On the surface, it looked "vigorous and lively," but in reality, after inspection, not only was production not promoted, but labor was wasted. Taking Lujiahe as an example: the village is a mountain village, and the land is all on mountain slopes and in mountain depressions, with many terraces and small plots. Too many people going there actually wasted labor. Lu Siyi said: "The plots are small. Hoeing from the west slope to the east slope wastes all the labor on the road!" Because they went to the fields together, some people wanted to work harder in the early morning and late evening, or wanted to do some odd jobs of their own, but were restricted. Once, Lu Xinao went to the market and came back early, and did some odd jobs in his own field, but someone raised the issue at the general meeting, calling him "selfish and self-interested." Since then, people would rather let the corners of the land lie fallow, or sit and sleep at home, than dare to go to the field to work at will. This spring, it was advocated to organize truly freely combined mutual aid groups. These three large groups were disbanded and reorganized into seven small mutual aid groups including ten or eight households. When doing work, organize labor according to the type of work, big jobs done by many, small jobs done by few, and odd jobs done separately. For example, Lu Shenyou's group has a total of ten households. When carrying manure, they carry it collectively. When weeding seedlings, they are divided into two groups. When plowing dry wheat fields, a pair of animals is a group. When pressing melon seedlings and compacting ridges, each does their own. When going to the field to weed seedlings, as long as it doesn't interfere with other people's work, they can also carry manure to their own melon or wheat fields. The method of allocating work in mutual aid is both flexible and practical. Everyone says: "This is liberation." This year, Lujiahe's production is better than last year's. All 273.8 mu of paddy fields have been weeded twice, and they have begun to weed a third time. The 168 mu of dry wheat fields were harvested in five days. More manure has been accumulated than last year. The old man Lu Yuancheng applied eighty loads of manure to his 1.5 mu of corn, and Lu Yuanfu applied more than one hundred loads to his 1.5 mu of corn.

　　卢家河解散互助大队
  　自由结合小型互助
    【太岳电】阳城卢家河解散形式主义的互助大队，改组成自愿灵活的小型组织，群众都说方便，生产情绪提高。卢家河互助队是过去“有名的”上官中有五村联合互助大队之一，全村六十四户，编了三个大组，妇女也随男人编了三个大组，大伙儿上地，一起回来。从表面看的确“轰轰烈烈”，但实际一检查，不但生产没推动，反倒费了工，以卢家河为例：该村是个山庄，土地都在山坡山凹，梯田多，地段小，去的人多了反倒赔工。卢思义说：“地段小，锄了西坡到东坡，把工全误在路上啦！”因为是一起上地，有人想起早抹黑多干一点，或是想做自己点零碎活，都受了限制。有一回卢喜闹去赶集回来的早，到自家地里干了点零碎活，就有人在大会上给他提出是“自私自利”。从那次以后，人们宁可让地＠地角荒了，宁可在家里坐坐睡睡，也不敢随意去地里劳动。今春提倡组织真正自由结合的互助组，这三个大组都散了，重新结合成七个包括十家八家的小型互助组。做活时按活组织劳力，大活大做，小活小做，零碎活各作各。如卢申酉组一共有十家，担粪时就集体担，锄苗时分了两起，犁旱麦地时一犋牲口为一组，压瓜踩垅时各做各。去地锄苗时，只要不误别人活，还可以给自己的瓜地或麦地捎粪。互助拨工的办法又灵活又实际，大家都说：“这是解放了”。今年卢家河的生产比去年作的好，二百七十三亩八分谷田，都锄过了二遍，已开始锄三遍。一百六十八亩旱麦地，五天就割完了。粪也比去年积的多，卢元成老汉亩半玉茭，上了八十担粪，卢元福亩半玉茭上了一百多担。
