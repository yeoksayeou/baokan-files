Investigating the Causes of Collapse and Studying Improvement Measures:
　　Beiyue Fourth District Opens Cooperation Meeting
　　Main Problem Lies in Abandoning Leadership; Great Efforts Will Be Made to Change in the Future.
　　[本报讯] The Beiyue Fourth District Commissioner's Office convened a production cooperation conference on August 11th. More than 30 people attended, including the heads of industry departments from various counties, directors of production promotion agencies, model village and community cadres, and cadres from the district commissioner's office, the local party committee, and bank offices. According to reports from various counties, most of the cooperative societies in the Fourth District have collapsed. Only a small number that truly serve the masses, genuinely solve problems for the masses, gain the support of the masses, and achieve consolidation and development remain. For example, the Zhaowangtai Village Cooperative in Fuping solved the two biggest labor burden problems for military families and war support, and also led the masses to plant more than 100 mu of trees and repair four irrigation canals. The Shanmen Village Cooperative in Pingshan organized the masses to raise sheep, developing into three flocks of sheep in more than three years; it held credit grain loans, solving a great difficulty for poor farmers. The Dongzaoyuan Village Cooperative in Jianping solved the funding difficulties for the village primary school's educational expenses. The Huojiazhuang Village in Jingxing organized various small mutual aid societies, effectively leading the masses to produce and overcome famine. The Xisu Village Cooperative in Zhengding used loans to drive private capital, repairing 60 wells throughout the village and adding more than 30 waterwheels. The production promotion agencies leading mass production in various counties have also done a lot to help the masses in production. For example, the Pingshan Promotion Agency helped the masses solve fertilizer difficulties, selling 12,000 jin of fertilizer bone meal, which saved half the money compared to using sesame cakes; it bought back 132 heads of livestock from Jin-Sui and Yanbei, selling them to the masses in the county at below-market prices; it sold 240 jin of red alum, which could be applied to more than 2,000 mu of land; it adopted the method of sending students to the countryside, promoting 14 new-style spinning machines. The Zhengding Production Promotion Agency organized more than 800 households of saltpeter producers to boil saltpeter to overcome the famine, earning a total of more than 225 million yuan this spring. The meeting revealed that many promotion agencies still focused their main efforts on long-distance transportation and sales and engaging in trading. For example, the Jianping Promotion Agency vigorously trafficked in local cloth (which has been stopped), and the promotion agencies in Huolu, Jingxing, and other counties vigorously engaged in retail sales... This urgently needs to be improved.

Why are most village cooperatives not doing well? Why can't many county promotion agencies effectively help the masses in production? Everyone believes that the main reason is that the Party Committee and other leading departments do not attach importance to this work and have abandoned leadership over the cooperative societies. Commissioner Cui Minsheng acknowledged at the meeting, "The cooperative societies have not been run well, and our responsibility is even greater. We have not provided good leadership." Deputy Commissioner Wang Sen said, "We have bureaucracy and do not understand the situation below." Li Fengshan, director of the Jianping Promotion Agency, said, "The Beiyue Production Conference decided that cooperative societies must strengthen top-down leadership, must follow the mass line, and be handled by the masses. I myself have not managed it." Liu Jinzhong of the Quyang Industry Department said, "The main problem with village cooperatives is the lack of leadership. When village cooperative cadres came to us to talk, we pushed them away, saying, 'Just go ahead and do it as you see fit,' 'We'll talk about it later.'" In terms of business, the promotion agencies in various counties spent the vast majority of their time and manpower on supply and marketing, and did not effectively help the masses in production. During the meeting, some county promotion agencies did not thoroughly examine this point. For example, after the rain, they failed to prepare seeds for the masses, and some comrades did not properly examine their own work. They emphasized that preparing seeds for the masses in the past was a failed lesson. Some emphasized that there were no cadres and no funds, and even said, "The masses can prepare themselves, they don't need us to prepare." These statements that neglected to help the masses in production were immediately criticized by other comrades at the meeting. They said, "All counties can spare most of their manpower and funds for supply and marketing, transportation and sales, and trading. Why is there no cadre or money for helping the masses in production? The main reason is that doing this is not as profitable as doing other things, which is a purely profit-seeking viewpoint." After everyone examined their thoughts, Li, the director of the Pingshan Promotion Agency, said, "In the past, I emphasized supply and marketing business and underestimated agricultural production." Li Fengshan, director of the Jianping Promotion Agency, said, "The Jianping Production Promotion Agency did not include preparing seeds to help agricultural production as an important business." After final discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that the production promotion agencies should take helping rural agriculture, sideline occupations, and handicraft production as their main business. Village cooperative societies should focus on organizing mass production.

Deputy Commissioner Wang emphasized at the end of the meeting that the cooperative societies in various counties should make good changes in their business in the future and serve the masses in production wholeheartedly. Various unnecessary businesses should be stopped; there should be a focus on the use of forces, and don't do everything, because if you do everything, you won't do anything well. Things that the masses can do themselves should be handed over to the masses. He pointed out that the phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline in the execution of decisions by the higher levels in various counties must be strictly corrected. As for the supply and marketing business of the promotion agencies, it will not be abolished uniformly in the future, but will be better strengthened to serve the masses. The promotion agencies in various counties should take the initiative to actively help the village cooperatives, rather than abandoning them. He said that this meeting gave us a great education and enlightenment in leadership. In the future, everyone should work harder and go deeper to do a good job in the mass production cooperation cause.

　　检查垮台原因研究改进办法
  　北岳四专开合作会议
    主要毛病在放弃领导决定今后大力转变
    【本报讯】北岳四专署于八月十一日召开生产合作会议。到各县实业科长、生产推进社主任、典型村社干部及专署、地委、银行办事处等干部共三十余人。据各县汇报，四专合作社已大部垮台，只有少部分真正为群众服务的，真正为群众解决了问题的，取得群众的拥护，得到巩固发展。如阜平照旺台村社，解决了优军战勤两个最大的群众劳力负担问题，还领导群众造林一百多亩，修渠四道。平山山门村社组织群众养羊，三年多发展到三群羊；举办信用贷粮，解决了贫苦农民的很大困难。建屏东枣园村社解决了村小学教育经费的困难。井陉霍家庄组织各种小型互助社，很好的领导了群众生产渡荒。正定西宿村社使用贷款，带动私资，修好全村六十眼水井，添置水车斗子三十多个。领导各县群众生产的推进社，也作了不少扶助群众生产的事情。如平山推进社帮助群众解决肥料困难，推销肥田骨粉一万二千斤，比用麻饼省钱二分之一；从晋绥、雁北买回牲口一三二头，低于市价卖给本县群众；推销红矾二百四十斤，能上地两千多亩；采用学员下乡的办法，推广新式纺纱机十四个。正定生产推进社组织八百多户硝民熬硝渡荒，今年春季共赚了两万万二千五百多万元。会上检查出不少推进社还是把主要力量放在搞长途运销与作买卖上面。如建屏推进社大力贩运土布（已被停止），获鹿、井陉等县推进社大力作门市买卖……这是亟待改进的。
    为什么大部村社办不好？许多县的推进社不能很好去扶助群众生产呢？大家认为：主要是党委与其他领导部门不重视这一工作，放弃了对合作社的领导。专员崔民生同志在会议上检讨说：“合作社没有办好，我们的责任更大。我们没有很好的领导”。副专员王森同志说：“我们有官僚主义，不了解下面情况。”建屏推进社主任李凤山同志说：“北岳生产会议决定合作社必须加强自上而下的领导，必须走群众路线，由群众处理，我自己也没有管过”。曲阳实业科刘金忠同志说：“村社主要是没有领导，村社干部找到我们去谈，就推说，‘你们看着闹去吧’‘以后再说吧’。”在业务上，各县推进社以绝大部分时间和人力作了供销，未很好扶助群众生产。会议中有些县推进社对此点检讨很不彻底，如雨后未能给群众准备种籽，某些同志不去很好的检讨自己的工作。并强调说：过去给群众准备种籽，都是失败的教训。有人强调没有干部没有资金，更有的说：“群众自己会准备不用我们准备。”这些忽视扶助群众生产的发言，立即遭到会中其他同志的批评。他们说：“各县都能拿出大部人力与资金作供销、运销、买卖，为什么扶助群众生产业务的就没有干部？没有钱？主要是搞这个不如搞别的赚钱，这是单纯的营利观点”。经过大家思想检查之后，平山推进社李主任说：“我过去是重视供销业务，轻视农业生产。”建屏推进社主任李凤山同志说：“建屏生产推进社就没有把准备种籽扶助农业生产列入重要业务之内。”经过最后讨论，大家一致认识了生产推进社应以扶助乡村农业、副业与手工业生产为主要业务。村合作社应以组织群众生产为主。
    王副专员在会议结束时强调指出：各县合作社今后应很好转变业务，全力为群众生产服务。各种不必要的业务应当停止；在力量的使用上应该有重点，不要什么都办，什么都办不好。群众自己能办交给群众去办。他指出：各县执行上级决议时的无组织无纪律现象，必须严格纠正。至于推进社的供销业务，今后不是一律取消，而是要更好的加强为群众服务。各县推进社对村社应当主动积极的去扶助他们，而不是放弃不管。他说：这次会议给了我们领导上以很大教育和启示，今后大家应更加努力深入下去，把群众的生产合作事业搞好。
