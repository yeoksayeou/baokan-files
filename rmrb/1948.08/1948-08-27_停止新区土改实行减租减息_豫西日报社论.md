Xinhua Central Plains News Agency, 24th: The Yu Xi Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Stop Land Reform in New Districts, Implement Rent and Interest Reduction," which was also published in the Yu Wan Su Xuefeng Newspaper. The original text is as follows:

Land reform is our party's fundamental policy in the stage of the New Democratic Revolution. Only by thoroughly implementing land reform, truly achieving land to the tiller, can the peasants, who account for more than 80% of the national population, be liberated; can the feudal system that hinders China's social and economic development be eliminated; can the social foundation of imperialist aggression against China be eradicated; can China's agricultural production be greatly developed; can industry and commerce prosper; can the foundation for national industrialization be established; can democracy and freedom be guaranteed; and can a new China that is independent, prosperous, free, and unified have a future. Therefore, the land reform policy should not only be implemented by our party and our army, but also by all patriotic parties and patriotic armies; it should not only be supported by workers, peasants, and all working people, but also endorsed by industrialists and businessmen. Even for landlords, land reform is to abolish the feudal exploitative land system, eliminate the parasitic landlord class that relies on this system to gain without labor, and not to eliminate landlords physically; and to transform landlords into self-reliant laborers or entrepreneurs, turning them from useless people to society into useful people. This is precisely the path to regeneration for landlords.

The importance and righteousness of land reform are undeniable. Why are we in the newly liberated areas of the Central Plains stopping land reform today and changing to rent and interest reduction instead? This is not because the land reform policy is incorrect, nor is it because the Central Plains area cannot implement land reform, but because the preparatory work for implementing land reform has not been fully carried out in most areas of the Central Plains. In the newly liberated areas of the Central Plains, and even in all newly liberated areas throughout the country in the future, we must implement land reform without exception. This is our party and our army's firm and unwavering fundamental policy, and we don't need to hide it from anyone. However, it should be known that to implement land reform, there must be a suitable environment and sufficient preparatory work. This preparatory work mainly consists of peasants having a high degree of political awareness and confidence in the victory of the revolution in their thinking, and truly forming their own core leadership figures composed of hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants in their organization. So, let us examine whether we have done these preparatory works well in the newly liberated areas of the Central Plains? Obviously, we have not done well. In the general newly liberated areas of the Central Plains, the vast majority of peasants are not prepared in terms of ideology and organization. The political awareness of the general peasants has not been raised, and their confidence in the revolution has not been established. Although they are poor and distressed, they lack a clear understanding of where poverty comes from; although they urgently need land, they lack a deep understanding of the principle of "land back to the hometown"; they warmly support the People's Liberation Army, but they are skeptical about whether the Liberation Army will occupy the land for a long time; they extremely hate the rule of the Jiang Party and the oppression of the Jiang bandits, but they have many concerns about overthrowing their rule and their grass-roots forces. In terms of organization, genuine peasant associations of hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants have not been organized well, and a large number of selfless core cadres who are genuinely loved by the local masses have not been cultivated. Therefore, the land reform in the new districts, even if it is better, is only a few activists coming forward to struggle, and the broad masses are still hesitant and watching. If we implement equal distribution of land now, it will inevitably lead to undesirable phenomena such as coercion and commandism, paternalism, and even a few people embezzling the fruits of the struggle. In some places, it is even manipulated by hooligans, rascals, and speculators, who take the opportunity to retaliate, seize the opportunity to get rich, and thus engage in indiscriminate beating, indiscriminate struggle, and indiscriminate confiscation, destroying policies and creating panic. The vast majority of poor peasants actually gain very little benefit. This is the general situation of land reform in the newly liberated areas of the Central Plains. Of course, there are also individual villages where the masses have truly been mobilized to do a good job in land reform, but the general situation is that the reform is nominally carried out but not actually carried out, carried out in a chaotic manner, or not carried out at all. What is the reason for this? This is the inevitable result of not doing the preparatory work well. Such land reform does not benefit the majority of peasants much, and it does not benefit the entire social production. It is precisely for this reason that the Central Plains Bureau of the CPC, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the CPC, decided to stop land reform in the newly liberated areas of the Central Plains and change to a policy of rent and interest reduction, so that peasants can reduce their rent and interest burdens, improve their lives, and initially develop agricultural production, and in the struggle for rent and interest reduction, increase peasants' political awareness and strengthen peasants' organizational strength. At the same time, we must persuade landlords to implement the rent and interest reduction decrees, and encourage and help them to gradually engage in labor. This gradually improving policy of rent and interest reduction is precisely the preparatory step for thorough land reform in the future, and therefore it is also the most practical class interest of the broad masses of peasants in the Central Plains at present. The view of those who are unwilling to stop land reform and are dissatisfied with the new policy of rent and interest reduction is obviously wrong. The entire party and army in the Central Plains must correctly understand the correctness of the Central Bureau's policy of stopping land reform and implementing rent and interest reduction, and resolutely implement it, in order to unite the people of all strata, strive for all possible forces that can be won over, and neutralize all possible forces that can be neutralized, reduce unnecessary resistance, establish a broad anti-American and anti-Chiang patriotic united front, in order to win the complete victory of the People's Liberation War. But on the other hand, we must maintain the vested interests of the peasants. All old liberated areas that have undergone rent and interest reduction and anti-traitor liquidation during the Anti-Japanese War or in the early stage of the People's Liberation War must continue to carry out land reform; all new liberated areas after the great advance last year should stop land reform and change to rent and interest reduction. But in these new districts, in the villages that have undergone land reform, the government should guarantee the land ownership of the peasants who have already been distributed land, and prohibit landlords from forcing peasants to return the land. Those who violate this should be severely punished; the landlords' floating wealth that has already been distributed should not be forced to be returned. Only when peasants voluntarily return the land and floating wealth, the government will not interfere. As for the property of middle peasants that should not be confiscated, and the industrial and commercial enterprises of landlords and rich peasants that have been confiscated, they should be returned to the original owners, or compensated in other ways. Continuing to implement land reform in the old liberated areas, stopping land reform and implementing rent and interest reduction in the new liberated areas, but maintaining the vested interests of the peasants, this is our party's basic policy in the Central Plains for a considerable period in the future. We hope that all comrades of the party and the broad masses of the people will understand this and strive to implement it, so that the 50 million people of the Central Plains can embark on the road to complete liberation!

### 停止新区土改实行减租减息　豫西日报社论

　　停止新区土改实行减租减息
  　豫西日报社论
    【新华中原社二十四日电】豫西日报顷发表题为：“停止新区土改实行减租减息”的社论，并在豫皖苏雪枫报同时发表。原文如下：
    土地改革是我党在新民主主义革命阶段中的基本政策。只有彻底实行土地改革，真正达到耕者有其田，占全国人口百分之八十以上的农民才能解放，障碍中国社会经济发展的封建制度才能肃清，帝国主义侵略中国的社会基础才能铲除，中国农业生产才能大大发展，工商业才能繁荣，国家工业化的基础才能确立，民主自由才有保证，独立富强自由统一的新中国才有前途。所以，土地改革政策不仅我党我军应该贯彻，凡是爱国党派与爱国军人都应该共同努力；不仅工人农民及一切劳动人民应该拥护，工商业家也应该赞成。就是对地主而言，土地改革是废除封建剥削的土地制度，消灭依靠这种制度不劳而获的寄生的地主阶级，而不是在肉体上消灭地主个人；并要改造地主个人为自食其力的劳动人民或经营工商业，使之由对社会为无用之人，变成有用之人。这正是地主个人的再生之路。
    土地改革的重要性与正义性是无可置辩的。为什么我们中原新解放地区，今天却又停止土地改革，而改为减租减息呢？这不是土地改革政策不正确，也不是中原地区不能实行土地改革，而是实行土地改革的准备工作在中原大部分地区尚未充分进行的缘故。我们在中原新解放区，以至将来在全国一切新解放区必须无例外的实行土地改革，这是我党我军坚定不移的基本政策，我们对任何人都用不着隐瞒。但是，应该知道，要实行土地改革必须有适当的环境与充分的准备工作，这个准备工作，主要是农民在思想上有高度的政治觉悟与革命胜利的信心，在组织上真正形成雇贫中农自己的核心领导人物。那么我们来检查在中原新解放区做好这些准备工作没有呢？很明显的没有做好。在中原一般的新解放区，绝大多数的农民，在思想上组织上并没有准备好。一般农民的政治觉悟尚未提高，革命的信心尚未确定。他们虽然贫苦困穷，但对穷苦究从何来，则缺乏清晰认识；虽然迫切需要土地，但对“土地回老家”的道理，则缺乏深刻了解；他们热烈拥护人民解放军，但对解放军是否占得长久，则将信将疑；他们极端痛恨蒋党统治与蒋匪压迫，但对打倒其统治及其基层势力则顾虑尚多。在组织上，真正雇贫中农自己的农民协会尚未组织健全，当地群众真心爱戴的大公无私的核心干部尚未大量培养出来。因此，新区的土地改革，较好者亦只是少数积极分子起来斗争，广大群众，还是徘徊观望，现在就实行平分土地，就不可免的产生强迫命令，包办代替，以至少数人贪污斗争果实等不良现象，有些地方甚至为流氓地痞投机分子所操纵，借端报复，乘机发财，因而乱打乱斗乱没收，破坏政策，造成恐慌，广大贫苦农民实际上亦很少得到利益。这是中原新解放区土地改革的一般情况。当然个别村庄真正群众发动做好土地改革者也有，但一般情况则是明改暗不改，乱改，或者根本未改。这是什么缘故呢？这就是准备工作未做好的必然结果。这样的土地改革，对多数农民好处并不多，对整个社会生产更无好处。正因为这个原因，中共中原局才根据中共中央指示，决定在中原新解放区停止土地改革而改为减租减息政策，使农民减轻租息负担，生活得以改善，农业生产得以初步发展，并在减租减息斗争中，提高农民的政治觉悟，加强农民的组织力量。同时，说服地主必须执行减租减息法令，并鼓励和帮助他们逐渐从事劳动。这种逐渐改良的减租减息政策，正是将来彻底土地改革的准备步骤，因此也正是中原广大农民群众目前最实际的阶级利益。不愿意停止土地改革、不满意新的减租减息政策的观点显然是不对的。中原全党全军必须正确认识中央局停止土地改革、实行减租减息这个政策的正确性，而坚决执行，以便团结各阶层人民，争取一切可能争取的力量及中立一切可能中立的力量，减少不必要的阻力，建立广泛的反美反蒋的爱国统一战线，以争取人民解放战争之彻底胜利。但另一方面，必须保持农民既得利益，凡是在抗战时期，或在人民解放战争初期，经过减租减息、反奸清算之老解放区仍须继续进行土地改革；凡是去年在大进军后的新解放地区，则应停止土地改革，改为减租减息。但在这些新区中，经过土地改革之村庄，凡是已经分得土地之农民，政府应保证其土地所有权，禁止地主强迫农民退地，违犯者应严加惩罚；其地主浮财已经分配了的，再不得强迫人民退回，只有在农民确系自愿退回土地及浮财时，政府才不加干涉。至于不应没收之中农财产，与地主富农之工商业被没收者，则应退还原主，或另行设法补偿之。在老解放区继续贯彻土地改革，在新解放区停止土地改革，实行减租减息，但须保持农民既得利益，这便是我党今后相当时期在中原的基本政策，望全党同志与广大人民共体斯旨，力求贯彻，使五千万中原人民走上完全解放之坦途！
