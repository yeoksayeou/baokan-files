Taiyue Electric: Amidst the calls to protect and develop industry and commerce, merchants in Jin City, including Wang Wenzhen, raised 3 million yuan to establish the small-scale New Xin Xin Chemical Factory. At the beginning of its operation, the factory encountered many difficulties due to the limitations of local material conditions. However, through the efforts of all employees to research and innovate, these difficulties were gradually overcome. The factory lacked certain equipment needed for the chemical industry, and the tooth powder produced was relatively coarse. After research, they used windmills to improve its fineness. When making fruit juice, they lacked distillation equipment, so they researched and manufactured a filter to replace it. When they couldn't find carbonic acid for raw materials, they used local methods involving limestone kiln ash to refine and produce it. They "tried their best to use all local raw materials to replace foreign goods," striving to achieve low costs and high-quality goods. After the "Meidi" brand toothpaste was launched, it was very well-received. They are still working on improvements and have started manufacturing soaps, laundry soaps, and "Wansheng" oil (all-purpose oil).

　　新新化学工厂利用土产代外货
    【太岳电】在保护与发展工商业声中，晋城市商民王文珍等集资三百万元，创办小规模的新新化学工厂。开办之初，因当地物质条件限制，遇到许多困难，但经全体职工努力研究改造，逐渐一一克服，该厂缺乏化学工业上的某种器具，所产牙粉比较粗糙，经研究利用风车，改进了细度，造果子露时，没有蒸溜器，就研究制造了一种过滤器代替。在原料上找不到炭酸＠，就用石仓桔煅砌煅渣盐提炼制成。他们“尽量利用一切土产原料代替外货”，设法作到成本低货物好。玫棣牌牙粉上市后，受到很大欢迎。现仍在钻研改进，并着手制造香皂、肥皂、万生油等。
