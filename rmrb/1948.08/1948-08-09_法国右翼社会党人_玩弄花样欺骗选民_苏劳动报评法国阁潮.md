Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. TASS reports: The Moscow Labor Newspaper published an article on July 29th commenting on the French cabinet crisis, pointing out that the complete bankruptcy of the Schuman cabinet was a result of policies that impoverished and destroyed the broad masses of people and surrendered to the Anglo-American bloc. When discussing the Socialist Party, the Labor Newspaper said: "From the development of recent events, the tactics of the right-wing Socialists are also very interesting. Because, in view of the upcoming French local elections, they decided to 'play a new trick.' In parliament, they demanded that the Schuman government's military budget, amounting to 310 billion francs, be cut by a negligible 12 billion francs, but they resolutely refused to support the French Communist Party's proposal, which could considerably ease the plight of the French people, to cut the budget by 40 billion francs." The Labor Newspaper pointed out that the reason they are playing such a new trick is to attempt to conceal their true reactionary faces with the false mask of "defenders of the people" in the local elections, so as to restore their prestige among the voters, at least to some extent. But in reality, anyone can see that the disagreement within the government party camp (Popular Republican Movement, Socialist Party, Radical Socialist Party) regarding the military budget is merely "a family quarrel." By the time Marie began to organize a new government on a so-called "broader basis"—which in reality was merely a coalition of elements ranging from Blum to Reynaud and disguised de Gaullists, as well as reactionaries of all stripes—the "intolerance" previously displayed by the Socialists had vanished without a trace.

    苏劳动报评法国阁潮
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：莫斯科劳动报于七月二十九日著文评论法国阁潮，指出舒曼内阁的完全破产，是使广大人民陷于贫困与毁灭、和投降英美集团的政策的结果。在论及社会党时，劳动报说：从最近事态的发展来看，右翼社会党人的策略也很有意思。因为他们鉴于法国地方选举就要来了，于是决定“来一个新花样”。他们在议会中要求将舒曼政府的数达三千一百亿法郎的军事预算，削减去微不足道的一百二十亿法郎，但对真正可以相当缓和法国人民处境的法共提案，即要求削减预算四百亿法郎，他们却断然拒绝支持。劳动报指出，他们所以要玩弄这样一个新花样，是企图在地方选举中，以“人民的保卫者”的假面具，掩盖其真正的反动面貌，以便至少在某种程度上恢复他们在选民中的威信。但实际上，谁都可以看出，政府党阵营（人民共和党、社会党、急进社会党）中关于军事预算的意见分歧，只不过是“一家人的口角而已。”等到马利开始在所谓“更广泛的基础上”组织新政府——实际上仅仅是联合从勃鲁姆到雷诺和伪装下的戴高乐分子以及各种各样牌子的反动分子组织政府时，社会党人前此所表演的“不宽容”，就已经消失得无影无踪了。
