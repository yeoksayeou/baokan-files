　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. News from various sources: A large-scale anti-fascist rally, organized by various democratic labor unions in Japan, was held as scheduled on the 15th in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. According to a TASS report citing the Asahi Shimbun: The number of participants reached 70,000, including members of the Japan National Postal Workers' Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, and other organizations. The conference passed several resolutions: protesting the revision of the Civil Service Law, demanding increased wages, demanding the elimination of the terror system and fascism, and demanding the resignation of the Ashida Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. The so-called "anti-communist rally," originally scheduled to be held at the same time and place, had to be aborted due to the power of the workers. On the same day, the Japan Women's Democratic Groups Committee also held a conference, attended by 2,000 women; workers of the Tokyo Printing and Publishing Industry Union and the All-Japan Machine Tool Industry Union carried out a 24-hour strike; and workers of the Electrical Industry Union carried out intermittent strikes at 38 power stations, cutting off power supply for a total of four hours. The strike by Hokkaido railway workers continues to persist; 67 striking workers were arrested on the 14th, and three union leaders were expelled; however, the number of striking drivers has increased to 353 as of the 15th, and 70 trains were suspended at 3 p.m. on the 14th. Due to this strike, coal transportation has been sharply reduced by four-fifths, with more than 8,000 tons of goods piled up.

　　东京七万工人齐集皇宫
  　举行反法西斯大会
    【新华社陕北廿日电】各方消息：日本各民主工会所主持的大规模反法西斯大会，于十五日如期在东京皇宫前举行。据塔斯社引朝日新闻载：与会者达七万人，包括日本国营递信工人工会、国营铁道工人工会及其他团体的会员。大会通过决议多项：抗议修改公务员法，要求增加工资，要求肃清恐怖制度及法西斯主义，要求芦田内阁辞职和解散议会。原定于同日同地举行的所谓“反共产主义大会”，慑于工人的威势，不得不宣告流产。同日，日本妇女民主团体委员会也举行大会，有两千妇女参加；东京印刷出版业工会和全日机器工具业工会工人进行了二十四小时的罢工；电气业工会工人在三十八个电力分站实行间歇性罢工，断绝电力供应前后达四小时。北海道铁道工人的罢工继续坚持着；十四日有六十七名罢工工人被捕，有三名工会领袖被开除；然而，罢工的司机，迄十五日止，已增加到三百五十三人，十四日午后三时，就有七十班火车停驶。由于这一罢工，煤的运输量锐减五分之四，货物堆积达八千余吨。
