　　Confiscated Shares of Small Vendors Should Be Returned
    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Daily published on May 9th that the belongings of small vendors should not be confiscated, the town of Tongtan in Zuoquan has returned my belongings in full, not even short by a thread. I am very happy and want to continue to set up a stall in Tongtan and work hard to prosper. Having no other way to repay the kindness, I am publishing this to thank the Communist Party's policy, and the town leader of Tongtan, Wang, and all the cadres of the Commercial Association for truly implementing the policy of protecting industry and commerce. When returning the items, regarding the half that my village confiscated, Town Leader Wang also sent a letter to my village, asking my village to return it in full. I do not yet know whether it has been returned or not.
    In addition, should the more than 400,000 yuan in shares I invested in the Huaxinglong store in Tongtan last year be returned? This money was also taken away from the Changzhi Military Industry Department by Kong Zhaoxuan and Kong Qingyu from my village. I would also like to ask the editor to provide an answer so that I can be at ease.
  　Respectfully, Kong Xianjing, Changzhi

To Mr. Kong Xianjing:
    The things wrongly confiscated by your village should also be returned. If they have not been returned, you can go back to the village and discuss with the village cadres and the masses to decide on a method of returning or appropriately compensating you based on whether it has been distributed or not. According to the policy of the democratic government to protect private property and protect industry and commerce, the shares you invested in the Huaxinglong store should also be returned to you. You can discuss with your village to resolve it reasonably based on the actual situation.

### 没收小商贩的股金应该退回

　　没收小商贩的股金应该退回
    编辑同志：
    自五月九号的人民日报上登出小摊贩的东西不应没收后，左权桐滩镇已经将我的东西如数退回，并不短到一线。我心非常高兴，要继续在桐滩摆摊，一定要好好的生产发家。无恩可报，就登报感谢共产党的政策，及桐滩镇的王镇长商联各干部真正的实行了保护工商业的政策。在退东西时我村没收的那一半，王镇长又与吾村去了信，叫吾村如数的退回。退与不退我现还不知道。
    另外，在去年间我在桐滩华兴隆商店入的股金四十多万元是否该退？此钱也是经吾村孔照选、孔庆玉从长治军工部算走了的，还得请编辑作一答复，吾也就安心了。
  　长治货孔宪敬礼孔宪敬先生：
    你村错没收你的东西，应该同样退回，若还未退，你可回村与村干群众共同商讨，根据已分或未分决定退还或适当补偿的办法。你在华兴隆商店入的股金，根据民主政府保护私人财产保护工商业的政策，也是应该退还给你的，可和你村中商量按实际情况合理解决。
