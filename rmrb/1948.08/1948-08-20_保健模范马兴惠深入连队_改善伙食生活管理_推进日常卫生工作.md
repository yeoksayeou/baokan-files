Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, August 18th: Health Model Ma Xinghui Goes Deep into Companies to Improve Food and Living Management and Promote Daily Hygiene

　　Ma Xinghui, a staff member of the Health Department of the Northwest People's Liberation Army Field Army, went deep into the company to study and improve the food and living management of the troops, transforming passive treatment into active health care. He proved that according to the existing supply standards of the troops, soldiers can obtain sufficient nutrition. Improving food management and living management, and promoting daily hygiene work are the main and effective methods to eliminate sources of disease and enhance the health of soldiers. Under the influence of his work, a large number of new health workers have emerged in the troops.

　　When Ma Xinghui went to work in a certain regiment, the leading cadres and patients of the troops hoped that he could "cure all diseases with medicine," but he focused his main energy on investigation and research to explore the source of diseases. As a result, it was found that more than 90% of the patients suffered from gastrointestinal diseases and colds, which were all caused by poor food preparation, lax living management, and inattention to daily hygiene. Based on this, he proposed to the department methods to improve food, etc. However, no one above or below had confidence, thinking that "it is impossible to improve food in the front." He held two cadre meetings, but to no avail. But he was not discouraged, and determined to do it himself, first to make practical effects in improving food, and then continue other work. He selected the third platoon of the sixth company of the second battalion to do a typical experiment. He helped the kitchen to wash rice and boil water, carry water and grind flour, changing the old methods of not washing rice and skimming rice soup, and making the meals soft and palatable and easy to digest; the dishes and meals were changed daily, and the general meal was cancelled, and meat was often eaten. In order to more carefully and scientifically investigate the food and absorption of each person, he personally served rice to the soldiers, registered the amount of food each person ate, educated the soldiers to develop the habit of chewing more and chewing carefully, weighed the soldiers' stool every day, and scientifically calculated the absorption of each person. As a result, the food improved, the grain was saved, the soldiers received more nutrition, and the number of patients decreased. At this time, the cadres trusted him, the soldiers respected him, the quartermasters and cooks became enthusiastic, and the medical staff became more active. The medical assistant of the third battalion understood the situation of the second battalion and returned to the team to hold a meeting, relayed Ma Xinghui's method, the eighth company quickly implemented it, and challenged all food units in the regiment, so this method was more quickly implemented throughout the country. At this time, he launched the company hygiene work on this basis, giving hygiene lessons to the soldiers, and educating the soldiers with concrete facts. For example, soldiers Cao Longde and Liu Ershu of the fifth company sweated when carrying firewood, and took off their clothes and hats as soon as they rested, resulting in a cold. He asked them to examine the cause of the disease and then educated them. During the long march, Ma Xinghui created many political slogans and posted them along the way. Such as: "Don't take off your clothes when climbing the mountain, you will get fewer colds, and you will make meritorious service by killing more enemies." On the river bank it was written: "Don't drink cold water, don't have a stomach ache, be strong and be a hero." He also organized a cheerleading team, and when he saw someone drinking cold water, he shouted: "Take care of your body for the revolution, don't drink cold water!" During the big rest, he must cook rice soup or boil water for the soldiers to drink. Once, after marching ninety miles, the soldiers fell asleep without untying their belts, and the cooks did not boil water for everyone to wash their feet. He personally boiled water and brought it to the soldiers, which moved the cooks to automatically boil water the next day, and the soldiers also automatically washed their feet. He selected a hygiene soldier in each squad and a hygiene leader in each platoon, plus a party guarantee, and constantly urged and checked the implementation of the above-mentioned hygiene work, so that there were few patients and stragglers in the march. Under the influence of Ma Xinghui's active and in-depth work, many new health workers have emerged in the battalion. The Health Department of the department has formulated the health policy of active health care in 1948 according to Ma Xinghui's method, and ordered all subordinate departments to learn Ma Xinghui's method. Due to Ma Xinghui's effective work achievements and valuable contributions to the army's health work, the former General Health Department specially promoted him to be the head of the health care section.

　　保健模范马兴惠深入连队
    改善伙食生活管理  推进日常卫生工作
    【新华社西北十八日电】西北人民解放军野战军卫生部工作人员马兴惠，深入连队研究与改善部队伙食及生活管理工作，一变消极治疗为积极保健。他证明了按部队现有供给标准，战士可获得足够的营养，改善伙食管理和生活管理与推进日常卫生工作，是目前杜绝病源与增强战士健康的主要和有效的方法，在他的工作影响下，部队中现已产生了大批新的保健工作者。
    当马兴惠下到某团工作时，部队的领导干部和病人都希望他能“药到病除”，但他却把主要精力放在调查研究，探讨病源上。结果发现百分之九十以上的病人均为肠胃病与感冒，而都是由于伙食作法不好，生活管理不严格，以及不注意日常卫生生活所致。据此他就向该部提出改善伙食等办法。但是上下都没有信心，认为“在前方改善伙食是不可能的。”他召开过两次干部会，都毫无结果。但他并不灰心，而决心亲自动手，首先在改善伙食上做出实际效果，再继续其他工作。他选定二营六连三排做典型试验。帮助伙房淘米烧水，担水推磨，改变不淘米和撇米汤的老办法，把饭菜做得稀软可口，容易消化；菜饭日变花样，取消大会餐，改为经常吃肉。为了更精细科学的调查每人的食粮和吸收量，他亲自掌勺给战士添饭，登记每人食量，教育战士养成多嚼细嚼的习惯，每天秤战士的大便，并科学计算出每人的吸收量。结果伙食改善了，粮食节省了，战士们得到的营养份量反而增加，病号也因而减少。这时干部相信他，战士受戴他，司务长、炊事员起劲了，医务人员都更积极起来。三营医助了解了二营情形回到队上就开会，转告了马兴惠的方法，八连很快就实行了，并向全团所有伙食单位挑战，于是这办法更快的在全国普遍的实行起来。这时他就在这个基础上展开连队卫生工作，给战士上卫生课，用具体事实教育战士。如五连战士曹龙德和刘二树背柴时出汗，一休息就解衣脱帽，结果感冒了。他就叫他们检讨病因，然后加以教育。在长途行军中，马兴惠创造了很多政治性的标语，沿途张贴。如：“上山不脱衣服少感冒，多杀敌人立功劳。”河畔上写着：“不喝冷水不肚痛，身强力壮当英雄。”他并组啦啦队，见有喝冷水的就啦道：“为革命爱护身体，不要喝冷水！”在大休息时，一定熬米汤或烧开水让战士喝。有一次行军九十里，战士们不解绑带就睡了，炊事员也不烧水给大家洗脚，他就亲自烧好水并端在战士们面前，感动得第二天炊事员自动烧水，战士们也都自动洗脚了。他在每班选一卫生战士，每排选一卫生组长，加上党内保证，经常督促检查上项卫生工作的实行，使该次行军很少病号和掉队的。该营在马兴惠积极深入工作的影响下，涌现了不少新的保健工作者。该部卫生部已根据马兴惠办法订出四八年积极保健的卫生方针，并令所属各部学习马兴惠方法。由于马兴惠切实有效的工作成绩，以及对军队卫生工作的宝贵贡献，前总卫生部特提升他为保健科长。
