Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 29th: After the liberation of Yanzhou, frontline reporters visited the Catholic General Church in the city. Ms. Wondong, a German dean of the Sheng Shenghui Convent in the church, first led reporters to visit an unexploded aircraft bomb in their dining room. According to them, this was one of the many bombs dropped by US-made Chiang Kai-shek planes on the church on the afternoon of the 13th. The bomb penetrated three floors and landed on the floor of the dining room. They were all near the bomb at the time, but fortunately it did not explode. While talking about this, the rumbling sound of Chiang Kai-shek planes suddenly came. Dean Wondong and a group of nuns hurriedly left the dining room to take shelter. Ms. Yingbolan, the German dean of Anduo Hospital in the church, and Dr. Xu Ximan, a Chinese doctor, were extremely indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's indiscriminate bombing and strafing. Dr. Xu pointed to a bullet-ridden roof outside the window and said, "There is a clear cross on the roof of our chapel. It can be seen clearly from the plane, but they still dropped bombs."

Father Cai Boyan of the church also severely criticized Li Yutang, commander of the Tenth Pacification District of the Chiang Kai-shek army, for occupying the bishop's building of the church. He said angrily: "Li Yutang took his attendants and a group of guards and forcibly occupied the bishop's building, eating, drinking, and playing cards with a dozen women every day, defiling the church. Li Yutang placed two sentries at the gate and two more inside, not only restricting the freedom of movement of people in the church, but also hindering parishioners from entering the church to worship. We argued with Li Yutang's guards three times about this matter, and five of our priests were beaten. During the battle, Li Yutang forced us out of the basement and let them hide inside." Father Cai said that this was not the first time he had been harmed by the Kuomintang army. He said: "On December 12, 1945, when the Kuomintang army in Tengxian County collapsed, the church house where he was located was burned down by them." Dr. Xu Ximan also indignantly accused the Chiang Kai-shek army of occupying the wards of Anduo Hospital and looting the hospital when they fled, even dismantling the cotton from the quilts in the wards and taking it away.

The clergy praised the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army after entering the city. Zhuang Lige, the German dean of the church's general hospital, said: "When the People's Liberation Army searched the church for Li Yutang, they were very polite to us. When I took them to inspect the various courtyards, they did not touch anything. Even when they were cleaning up Li Yutang's rooms, they carefully distinguished between Li's belongings and the church's belongings, and did not take anything from the church by mistake." Dr. Xu Ximan excitedly talked about his first time seeing the People's Liberation Army. He said: "Soon after the fleeing Kuomintang army looted the hospital, a company commander from the People's Liberation Army entered the hospital. I told him about the situation in the hospital, and he said kindly, "Since there are no enemies here, I can immediately notify my troops to stop them from entering. Don't panic." Yanzhou is a diocese, governing the church affairs of eleven counties including Yanzhou, Qufu, Sishui, Zou County, Teng County, Jining, Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, Yutai, Wenshang, and Yixian. The General Church has Sheng Shenghui, Sheng Jia Hui, Anduo Hospital, etc., and is attached to Yude Primary School, Printing House, and Infant Asylum.

    访问兖州教堂
    弹痕累累都是美造蒋机罪迹
    教堂人士盛赞我军纪律严明
    【新华社华东前线二十九日电】前线记者于兖州解放后走访该城天主教总教堂。该堂盛神会修女院德籍院长翁德朗女士首先引记者参观他们饭厅里一颗未炸的飞机炸弹。据他们说，这是十三日下午美造蒋机向该教堂所投许多炸弹中的一个。此弹击穿三层楼房，落在饭厅的地上，当时她们都在这颗炸弹的附近，但幸而没有爆炸。谈到这里，忽然传来蒋机隆隆声音，翁院长和一群修女们即急忙离开饭厅躲避去了。该教堂安多医院之德籍英伯兰院长（女），中国籍徐西满大夫，对蒋机滥施轰炸扫射极为愤慨，徐大夫指着窗外一个弹痕累累的屋顶说：“我们礼拜堂的屋顶上有一个显明的十字架，飞机上是可以看得清清楚楚的，但是他们还是扔炸弹。”
    该堂蔡伯彦神父并痛责蒋军第十绥靖区司令李玉堂霸占该堂主教楼，他气愤的说：“李玉堂带着他的侍从和一群卫士，强住主教楼，天天和十几个妇女吃喝打牌，污辱了教堂。李玉堂在大门口放了两个岗，里面布有两个岗，不但教堂里的人行动不自由，教民进堂作礼拜也受阻难。为了这件事，我们和李玉堂的卫兵争执过三次，有一次我们有五个神甫竟被他们打伤了。战斗中，李玉堂又强把我们从地下室赶出来，让他们躲进去。”蔡神父说他遭国民党军队的侵害这已不是第一次，他说：“一九四五年十二月十二日，滕县国民党军溃退时，他所在的教堂房子就被他们烧毁了。”徐西满大夫亦愤慨的指责蒋军侵占安多医院病房，并于逃跑时抢劫了医院，连病房里的棉被都拆了棉花拿走了。
    教士们对解放军进城后的纪律严明都极为赞扬。该教堂总院德籍院长庄立格说：“解放军在教堂搜索李玉堂时，对我们很客气，我带着他们到各院察看时，他们对什么东西都没有动，就是收拾李玉堂住房里的东西时，对李和教堂的东西都仔细分清，没有错拿教堂一点东西。”徐西满大夫则兴奋的说起他第一次看见解放军的情形，他说：“逃跑的国民党军抢劫了医院不久，解放军的一位戴连长进了医院，我将医院里的情形告诉了他，他很和蔼地说：“既然这里已没有敌人，我可以立刻通知我的部队，要他们不再进来，你们不要惊慌。”按兖州系一教区，统辖兖州、曲阜、泗水、邹县、滕县、济宁、嘉祥、金乡、鱼台、汶上、峄县等十一个县的教务。总教堂下有盛神会、盛家会、安多医院等，附办有育德小学、印刷所、婴儿院等。
