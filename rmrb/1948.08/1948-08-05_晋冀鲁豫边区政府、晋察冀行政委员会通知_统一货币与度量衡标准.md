    Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Administrative Committee Notice
    Unifying Currency and Standards of Weights and Measures
    [Our Newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee issued a joint notice on July 22 stating: During the Anti-Japanese War, due to enemy blockade and division, the currency and standards of weights and measures in the two regions could not be unified. Now that our two regions are completely connected, the currency calculations, standards of weights and measures records, and numerical positioning in the account books, reports, and reimbursement procedures of various departments urgently need to be consistent. Otherwise, it will not only increase the difficulty of identification and conversion, but also easily cause errors and create work losses. In order to unify this in the future, the following are specifically stipulated: (1) All cash receipts and expenditures shall be calculated based on the local currency, Ji banknotes. The circulation of Border Region currency shall be converted into Ji banknotes for accounting purposes according to the previously stipulated exchange rate (one to ten). (2) The standards for weights and measures records shall be uniformly as follows: 1. Scale – use the market scale as the standard, i.e., two market catties equals one kilogram. 2. Peck – use the market peck as the standard, i.e., each peck of millet equals sixteen market catties. 3. Foot – use the market foot as the standard, i.e., three market feet equals one meter. For financial departments' receipts and expenditures of money, grain, and in-kind goods converted into rice, accounting shall be done in catties, and there is no need to convert into pecks and stones. (3) For numerical positioning, it shall start from the ones place, and every three digits shall be a position. The position symbol shall be “,” and not “.”. (4) For decimal places below integers, fractions shall not be used, and the symbol shall be “.”, not “,”. (5) All account books, reports, and reimbursements of government financial, monetary, trade, taxation, and military supply departments must be handled in accordance with the new regulations. Since this matter involves many specific procedural changes, it will be implemented in two steps: 1. The receipts and expenditures reports, budgets, and final accounts of all departments will be implemented starting in August. 2. The renovation of account books will be implemented starting on January 1, 1949.

    晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀行政委员会通知
    统一货币与度量衡标准
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会于七月二十二日发出联合通知称：抗战期间，由于敌人封锁分割，致使两区货币及度量衡标准未能统一，现在我两区已完全连成一片，各部门在帐册、报表、报销手续上，其货币计算，度量衡记载标准及数码定位等，亟应求得一致，不然，不仅增加识别与折算困难，且易发生错误，造成工作损失，兹为今后统一起见，特规定如次：（一）现金收支往来一律以本位币冀钞为计算标准，边币行使按前规定比价（一比十）折成冀钞记帐。（二）度量衡记载标准统一下列规定：１、秤——以市秤为标准，即二市斤等于一公斤。２、斗——以市斗为标准，即小米每斗等于十六市斤。３、尺——以市尺为标准，即三市尺等于一公尺（米突）。财政部门钱、粮、实物收支折米，一律以斤为单位记帐，不必再折斗石。（三）数码定位，一律从个起，每三位数字为一定位处，定位符号均用“，”，不得用“．”号。（四）整数以下使用小数，一律不用分数，其符号为“．”不得用“，”号。（五）凡政府财政金融、贸易、税务及军队供给部门，其帐册报表报销，均须依照新规定办理。因此事牵连到许多具体手续的变动，又分两步实行：１、各部门收支报表、预算、决算，从八月起实行。２、改造帐簿从民国三十八年一月一日起实行。
