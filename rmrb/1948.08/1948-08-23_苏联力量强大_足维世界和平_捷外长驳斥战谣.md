　　Soviet Strength Ensures World Peace
    Czech Foreign Minister Refutes War Rumors

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 20th:  The Elektrotechnische Agentur (ETA) in Prague reported on the 15th: "There will be no war; because: first, the Soviet Union is strong. Second, the majority of humanity loves peace." This was the firm belief expressed by Czech Foreign Minister Clementis, currently attending the Danube River Conference in Belgrade, when speaking to an American reporter. He pointed out: "The Soviet Union's military strength is an important factor in maintaining peace in the world today. The danger of war is no greater now than it was last year, but the international situation has not improved." He believes that the Western countries are responsible for the deterioration of the international situation because they have engaged in revising the principles and treaties established during and after the war, such as the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam agreements, and the United Nations Charter.

　　苏联力量强大  足维世界和平
    捷外长驳斥战谣
    【新华社陕北二十日电】电通社布拉格十五日讯：“不会有战争；因为：第一、苏联力量强大。第二、人类大多数爱好和平。”这是现在贝尔格莱德出席多瑙河会议的捷克外长克里门蒂斯对美国记者谈话时表示的坚定信念。他指出：“苏联的军事力量，是在目前世界上维持和平的重要因素。现在战争的危险并不比去年更大，然而国际形势也未见改进。”他认为：西方国家已从事修改德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨顿诸协定与联合国宪章等在战时及战后订立的原则和条约，他们应对国际形势之恶化负责。
