　　Where is the mistake?
  　Opinions on "Whose decree is it to sweep me out the door?"
    (I) Comrade Zhao Hong's letter
    Comrade Editor:
    After reading the "Masses' Voices" article "Whose decree is it to sweep me out the door?" published in your newspaper's issue number 46, I have two feelings: First, it does reflect a case in our work where coercive orders violate the Party's policies, so serious that it leads to "sweeping out the door." This is enough to arouse our high vigilance. But, second, I also feel that this "Masses' Voices" lacks necessary self-criticism regarding its errors and backwardness, and the editor did not add an editor's note to point this out. Therefore, I feel it is somewhat one-sided. For example, the "Voices" says: "My brother is a soldier who is overdue in returning, so of course he first becomes an expansion target." I think: "Overdue in returning" is a violation of the solemn revolutionary military discipline of our People's Liberation Army. This expansion of the army is by no means a matter of "expansion targets," but rather a matter of "returning to the ranks" as ordered. However, his brother not only did not do this, but still attempted to remain at large and resisted with abuse, which is even more wrong! It is by no means that one can "curse a few times" because one is "agitated." It is actually another violation of revolutionary military discipline! I disagree with and resolutely oppose the village cadres' practice of "parading through the streets," "facing the door," and even "sweeping out the door." But I believe that there is nothing wrong with implementing "cadres taking the lead in everyone's exposure" of those who violate military discipline. At the same time, if education is ineffective, it is also necessary to "send them to the county people's court" according to the law. In addition, I fully agree with the opinions of Comrade Liu, the county party secretary, on handling the matter. The district committee did not instruct the village cadres to resolutely and quickly correct the erroneous practices of "sweeping out the door," etc., but instead adopted a resistant attitude, which is of course an intolerable error. However, the "Voices" makes no mention of "letting Li Xuewen return to the ranks and apologizing to all the villagers for admitting his mistake." Did he do this? I hope that Li Xuewen not only "admits his mistake," but also "immediately returns to the ranks" to correct his mistake.
    At the same time, the county, district, and village cadres in the area should express their attitudes toward the true facts.

    (II) Comrade Yang Jinzhang's letter
    Comrade Editor:
    After reading the article "Whose decree is it to sweep me out the door?" published on the first page of the July 30th issue, I think this issue should be viewed from two aspects: First, arbitrarily "sealing doors," "confiscating," and "sweeping out the door" are errors in principle that should be stopped immediately. The district committee's failure to follow the county committee's instructions is a violation of Party discipline, and the district committee should be severely criticized or punished. Second, since Li Xuezhong knows that his brother's being overdue in returning is wrong, how shameful it is to desert from the revolutionary army! Instead of mobilizing his brother to return to the ranks earlier in coordination with the district and village cadres, he waited until the masses publicly discussed it and unanimously agreed that his brother should return to the ranks, but his own brother instead cursed and refused to return. Li Xuezhong should also examine himself.
    Finally, I feel that when publishing such articles in the newspaper, a criticism should be added to clearly distinguish between right and wrong, so that the masses will not be confused after reading it. Otherwise, the significance of guidance and education will be reduced.

    Last month on the 30th, we published Li Xuezhong's voice from Monan Village in Xian County: "Whose decree is it to sweep me out the door?" Subsequently, we received letters from Comrades Zhao Hong and Yang Jinzhang, who expressed their opinions and pointed out that the publication of that "Masses' Voices" without an editor's note reduced the significance of guidance and education. The spirit of Comrades Zhao and Yang in resolutely safeguarding the "solemn military discipline of the People's Liberation Army" is very good, and their opinions on our editorial work are also correct. At that time, the editor's simple publication without an editor's note was indeed an oversight in our editorial work. We believe that the main point of that "Masses' Voices" is to reflect the serious anarchism and lack of discipline that exists in our work. Therefore, what needs to be emphasized is still:
    (1) The coercive commanding style of the village cadres in that village should be given attention and corrected by the leadership. Mobilizing soldiers to return to the ranks is necessary work, but abandoning persuasive mobilization that enlightens consciousness and adopting abusive and coercive methods such as "parading through the streets," "detaining people," and even "sweeping the whole family out the door" are all wrong. Therefore, what Comrade Zhao Hong said about sending them to the people's court is also unnecessary. This will not only fail to do a good job in the work of returning to the ranks, but will also damage the Party's prestige among the masses. This is a bad style that must be corrected.
    (2) The district committee's refusal to implement the county committee's instructions and its leadership of the village cadres in stubbornly implementing their own erroneous practices, with no regard for Party discipline, should be criticized or punished.
    (3) The village cadres' threat to the higher authorities that they would "move out of the village and stop working" has resulted in the county committee's decision not being implemented to this day, which shows that the county-level leadership still harbors a laissez-faire attitude towards the mistakes made by its subordinates. Furthermore, the county committee's lack of inspection of the village cadres' deceptive behavior in not implementing the instructions of the higher authorities proves that the county committee lacks seriousness in implementing the Party's policies, which is also worthy of review.
    How will this issue be handled? Has Li Xuezhong's door been unsealed? Is there anything in his reflection that does not conform to the facts? Please, comrades of the relevant county, district, and village cadres, express your attitudes based on the facts.

### 错误在哪里？　对“把我扫地出门是谁的法令”的意见

专栏：编读往来

　　错误在哪里？
  　对“把我扫地出门是谁的法令”的意见
    （一）赵洪同志来信
    编辑同志：
    我读过贵报第四十六号登载的“把我扫地出门是谁的法令”一篇“群众呼声”之后，有两个感觉：第一，确实反映了我们工作中一个强迫命令违犯党的政策，严重到以为“扫地出门”的实例，这足以引起我们的高度警惕；但是，第二，也使我感到这篇“群众呼声”，对其错误与落后还缺乏必要的自我批评，编辑也未加按语指出，因而，我感到有些片面性。比如该“呼声”中说：“我兄弟是过期不归的战士，当然首先成为扩军的对象”，我以为：“过期不归”，是对我人民解放军庄严的革命军纪的一个破坏；此次扩军，绝不是什么“扩军对象”，而是遵令“归队”的问题，然而，他的弟弟，不但没有这样做，而且仍企图逍遥法外，并以谩骂抗拒，这更是错上加错！也绝不是什么“激动起来”便可以“骂了几句”，实际是对革命军纪的又一破坏！我不同意并坚决反对该村干部之“游街”“对门”以至“扫地出门”的做法，但是我以为对破坏军纪的分子，实行“干部领头大家检举”，是并没有错误的。同时如果是教育无效后，依法“送到县人民法庭”，也是必要的。此外，我完全同意该县县委书记刘同志处理的意见，区委没有指示村干坚决迅速纠正“扫地出门”等的错误做法，反而采取了抗拒态度，这当然是不能容忍的错误。但是，该“呼声”中一点也没提到“让李学文归队，并向全村群众道歉认错”，他是否做了呢？我希望：李学文不仅要“承认错误”，而且，必须应该“立即归队”，才算改正了错误。
    同时，对真实的真象，该地县、区、村干部还应表示态度。

    （二）杨金章同志来信编辑同志：
    看了七月三十日第一版刊载的那篇“把我扫地出门是谁的法令”以后，我认为此问题要从两方面来看：一、随便“封门”，“没收”，“扫地出门”是原则上的错误，应立加制止，区委不听从县委指示，是违犯党的纪律，区委应受到严格批评或处分。二、李学忠既然知道其弟过期不归是错误，从革命部队潜逃跑是多么可耻呢！不早日协同区村干部动员其归队，一直等到群众公议，一致认为其弟应归队，自己的弟弟反而谩骂，拒绝归队，李学忠也应检讨。
    最后我感觉，报上登载此类文章，应加批判，是非分明，使群众看了不至于模糊，不然，会减低指导教育的意义。

    上月三十日，我们发表了献县陌南村李学忠的呼声：“把我扫地出门是谁的法令。”接连，我们则收到赵洪及杨金章两同志来信，提出意见，并指出登载那篇“群众呼声”时没加按语，减低了指导教育意义。赵杨二同志这种坚决维护“人民解放军庄严军纪”的精神是很好的，对我们编辑工作上提出的意见也是正确的。当时，编者未加按语简单发表，确是我们编辑工作上的疏忽。我们认为那篇“群众呼声”，主要是反映了我们工作中存在着严重的无政府无纪律现象，因之，需要着重指出的仍然应该是：
    （一）该村村干部的强迫命令作风，亟应引起领导上注意纠正。动员战士归队是必要的工作，但放弃启发自觉的说服动员，采取“游街”、“扣人”、甚至把全家“扫地出门”等虐待强迫的作法，都是错误的。因此，赵洪同志所说送到人民法庭等也是不必要的。这不但不可能做好归队工作，反而伤害党在群众中的威信，这是必须纠正的一种坏作风。
    （二）区委拒绝执行县委指示，领着村干部一意执行自己的错误做法，肆无党纪，应该受到批评或处分。
    （三）村干部威胁上级“搬出村去不干工作了”，竟然使县委决定至今未得贯彻，这说明县级领导上对下级所犯错误仍抱姑息态度。而该县县委会对村干部不执行上级指示的欺骗行为，又缺乏检查，证明县委对执行党的政策缺乏严肃性，也都值得进行检讨。
    此问题究竟如何处理？李学忠的门是否已启封？其反映是否有不符事实之处？请献给有关的县区村干部同志根据事实，表明态度。
