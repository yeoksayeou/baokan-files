Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: The Weifang Special Municipal Democratic Government has returned a large number of machinery, factory buildings, and other materials from private factories and businesses that were seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits during their occupation. According to the announcement by the Industry and Mining Department of the East China Financial and Economic Office Materials Handling Committee on June 9th, a total of twenty-five factories and businesses have been returned, with a total of one hundred and fifty pieces of important material (mostly mechanical iron factories). The returned machinery includes six motors, four lathes, one 6.6 kilowatt generator, and one 15 horsepower diesel engine, forty-three factory buildings, and a large number of other tools, furniture, and materials.

When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied Weifang, they arbitrarily plundered factories through forced borrowing, forced buying at low prices, and direct seizure. For example, the Donglai Paper Mill had just been prepared and was about to start operations when it was completely seized by the Second Detachment of the Mobile Repair Unit of the 44th Arsenal of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit United Logistics Headquarters Ordnance Department. The Fufeng and Minguang Iron Factories were forced to close down due to the exorbitant taxes levied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and were then completely seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits under the guise of "numbering" the houses, including the factory buildings and equipment. Although the factories had repeatedly appealed to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits refused to return them, saying, "Now is the time of general mobilization. No matter your manpower, material resources, or financial resources, if the country needs it, you have to give it!" The seized machinery and materials were greatly damaged. For example, the Fufeng Factory originally had more than twenty belts for pulling the main shaft, but now only one is intact.

After the liberation of Weifang, the Industry and Mining Department repeatedly announced at the industrial community symposium the policy of "resolutely returning all private enterprises seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits," and notified all private factories to quickly report so that they could be returned. However, because after the surrender of the Japanese devils in the past, when general factories asked the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to return the machinery and materials seized by the Japanese devils, they were charged with the crime of "suspected traitor," and the materials forcibly borrowed and seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were never returned. Those who were plundered had long been desperate and had no intention of asking about them. Therefore, at the beginning of the announcement of the return, it aroused the doubts and hesitation of the general factories, and few reported. In mid-May, the government first returned the sixteen houses and various properties of Tan Zuochun, which were seized by the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit No. 1 Division's Bullet-Making Office. After that, the general factories dispelled their doubts, and the number of reports increased day by day. As of the end of May, the Industry and Mining Department had preliminarily completed the return of private property forcibly borrowed and seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the past three years. The procedures for the return were extremely simple and quick. First, the factories reported themselves, presented evidence, and after the government verified that it was true, it was returned. It generally took only three days to a week from reporting to returning. Therefore, this time, the preliminary return procedures were completed in just three weeks. In the return process, there were also a few who attempted to make false reports or overreport. In addition to exposing and criticizing them, the government also returned all parts that were indeed private property.

The factories were extremely excited after receiving their materials back. They all said, "The Kuomintang came and seized them, and the Communist Party came and returned them. The world has really changed!" Tiancheng, Defeng, Sun Tong, Deshengtai Iron Factories, Sanguang Electrical Materials Store, Xinfeng Dyeing and Printing Company, and other factories jointly published an advertisement in the New Weifang Daily to express their gratitude. The factories are now actively resuming work.

Also, the Weifang City has recently had eight iron factories and six foundry factories fully resume work. In total, the city has resumed operations of twenty-seven iron factories and foundry factories. The thirteen mechanical iron factories that had resumed work earlier have produced a large number of cigarette cutting machines, bean rolling machines, waterwheels, cotton fluffing machines, and large axle shafts in the past month or so, with a transaction value of 35.8 million yuan in North Coin, which were sold to Huimin, Lijin, Pingdu, Zhucheng, Ju County, Anqiu, Yexian, Yishui and other places. The Huafeng Iron Factory in the city is now actively preparing to manufacture cotton seed hulling machines. This type of machine produced by the factory before the war could hull more than 10,000 catties of cotton seeds per day. The Yulu Pigment Company, the largest pigment manufacturing factory, whose products were sold throughout the country before the war, has resumed production on the 23rd of last month after more than a month of efforts to repair and renovate. The factory is currently trying to purchase machines, procure raw materials, and expand production.

    蒋匪在潍坊时期霸占民营工厂
    民主政府发还原主
    【新华社华东二十四日电】潍（县）坊（子）特别市民主政府，发还蒋匪盘踞期间所强占的民营厂商的大批机器厂房等资材，据华东财经办事处物资处理委员会工矿部六月九日公布，共计已发还二十五家厂商，重要物资一百五十余件（其中以机械铁工厂为最多）。发还机器中有马达六部，旋床四部，六点六千瓦发电机及十五马力柴油机各一部，厂房四十三间，另有其他大批工具、家具、物资等。
    蒋匪盘踞潍坊时，曾以强借、低价强买与直接霸占等方式任意掠夺各厂。如东莱造纸厂刚筹办完好准备开工，就被蒋匪联勤总部兵工署第四十四兵工厂游动修理第二大队全部霸占。蚨丰、民光两铁工厂因蒋匪捐税奇重，被迫歇业时，即被蒋匪假“号”房子为名，连同厂房、器材，全部霸占。各厂商虽曾一再向蒋匪提出申诉，但蒋匪皆以“现在是总动员时期，不管你人力、物力、财力，国家要，你就得给！”为辞，拒绝退还。被蒋匪霸占的机器物资，皆耗损极大。如蚨丰厂原有拉动大轴的皮带二十余根，现仅剩一根是完好的。
    潍坊解放后，工矿部即在工业界座谈会上一再宣布，“凡系蒋匪霸占的民营企业坚决发还”的政策，并通告各民营厂商迅速具报以便发还。但由于过去日寇投降后一般厂商向蒋匪索回日寇霸占之机器资材时，皆被蒋匪加上“汉奸嫌疑”的罪名，同时蒋匪所强借霸占之物资，从来是有去无还，被掠夺者早已绝望无心过问，故在宣布发还之初，反引起一般厂商疑惑不决，具报者无几。五月中旬政府首先发还谭作春被蒋匪保一师制弹所强占之房屋十六间及各种资财等以后，一般厂商疑虑顿释，具报者乃日益增多。截至五月底，工矿部即将三年来蒋匪强借霸占之私人物资，初步发还完毕。在发还中，手续极为简便迅速。首由厂商自报，提出证据，经政府调查属实，即行发还。自具报至发还一般仅需三天至一星期。因此此次仅三星期即将初步发还手续全部结束。发还中亦有少数企图假报、多报者，政府除予以揭发和批评外，对确属其私人部分亦予全部发还。
    各厂商领回物资后，均兴奋异常。都说：“国民党来了霸占，共产党来了发还，真是变了世道了！”天成、德丰、孙桐、德盛泰等铁工厂及三光电料行、信丰染印公司等厂商，特在新潍坊报上联名登报鸣谢。现各厂商正积极复工中。
    又讯：潍坊市最近又有八家铁工厂及六家翻砂厂全部复工。总计全市已复业之铁工厂、翻砂厂共达廿七家。前已复工之十三家机械铁工厂，月余来已制出大批切烟机、轧豆机，水车、弹花机、大车轴等，成交额达三千五百八十万元北币，推销于惠民、利津、平度、诸城、莒县、安邱、掖县、沂水等地。该市华丰铁工厂现正积极筹备制造棉子剥皮机。该厂战前出产之此种机器，每部可日剥棉子一万斤以上。规模最大之颜料制造厂裕鲁颜料公司战前出品畅销全国各地，现经月余努力修整，已于上月二十三日开工生产。厂方刻正设法添购机器。采办原料，扩大生产。
