　　Mass Stone Tablets Should Not Be Used Casually
    Editor:
    I went to Nanle County on official business in July. The few cadres in Foshan Village, District 5, of the county took all the stone tablets (including the road markers and tombstones of landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants). Some were used to build bridges, and some were thrown away. The masses are very dissatisfied with this matter and the reaction is very bad. The masses asked me: Did the higher authorities order the pulling down of stone tablets? Is this right? Is commemorating ancestors superstitious? If so, why do the Eighth Route Army still build martyrs' cemeteries, erect monuments for martyrs, and hold memorial meetings for martyrs? I said: I dare not give you a specific answer. I will ask the newspaper for you. Please answer how this question should be answered. 　　Li Bingshan
    △Answer: Commemorating ancestors is not superstitious, but at present, when superstition in rural areas has not yet been eliminated, the general masses' commemoration of ancestors is connected with superstition. However, regardless of whether it is superstitious or not, stone tablets are privately owned, and village cadres should not pull them away casually. The stone tablets that have been pulled away by the village should be apologized for and compensated to the masses, and those that have not been used should be returned to their original owners. --Editor

　　群众石碑不应随便拉用
    编辑同志：
    我于七月间赴南乐县公干，该县五区佛善村少数干部当家把所有的石碑都拉光了（地主富农中农贫农的路碑墓碑都在内）。打桥用了一部分，还扔着一部分。群众对于这个事情都很不满意，反映很不好。群众问我：拉石碑上级有命令没有？这事对不对？纪念祖先算不算迷信？如算的话为啥八路军还修烈士陵园，给烈士立碑还开纪念烈士大会，我说：我也不敢给你们具体答复，我给你在报社里问一下吧。此问题倒底怎样对，请答复。  　　李炳善
    △答：纪念祖先不算迷信，但在目前，农村中迷信还未扫清时，一般群众纪念祖先是和迷信相连系的，不过不管是否迷信，石碑皆属于私认所有，村干是不应该随便拉走的。该村拉走的石碑已经用了的，应向群众道歉赔不是，未用的应归还原主。——编者
