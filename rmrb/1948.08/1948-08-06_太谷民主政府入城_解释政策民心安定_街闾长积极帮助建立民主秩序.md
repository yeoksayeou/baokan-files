    Taiyuan Telegram: The democratic order in Tai Gu city is being actively established. After the Democratic Government entered the city, it immediately convened a meeting of all street chiefs, announcing that the grain and money owed to the Yan bandits by the masses would be stopped from collection; the government explained in detail the various policies of our Party, especially the policies of protecting industry, commerce and intellectuals, stabilizing the people's hearts, and establishing a democratic order. It was announced to the puppet personnel that those who do not resist the People's Liberation Army and the laws of the Democratic Government with weapons will not be arrested, and they were called upon to repent and serve the people. Those who have committed general crimes in the past can atone for their crimes as long as they thoroughly correct their mistakes. The puppet personnel present were greatly moved and expressed that they would completely listen to the Democratic Government and work for the people in the future. Bai Wei-cheng, the acting street chief of the Southeast Street, said, "Yan Xishan's staff are all bureaucrats. They order you to do whatever they want. If you don't do it well, they will say you are 'pretending'. No one dares to say anything. The policy of the Eighth Route Army is good. The cadres speak in a consultative and friendly manner. Everyone is willing to work." Hao Ying-sheng, the third ward chief of the street, actively carried out various registration and investigation tasks after the meeting to help establish a new democratic order.
    Taiyuan Telegram: The citizens of Tai Gu warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army and the Democratic Government into the city. Slogans of various colors such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army," "Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people," and "Support the Democratic Government" were posted all over the doors of shops. Slogans such as "Support Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, capture Yan Xishan alive," "Down with the hook army" (the common people call Yan Xishan's 19th Army the hook army), and "Liberate the whole of Shanxi" could be heard everywhere. The lively scene on the street made it hard to believe that the city had just been liberated. Nearly 3,000 citizens in the city spontaneously gathered, beating gongs and drums, and lined up to the East Gate to welcome the People's Liberation Army and Democratic Government personnel into the city. A 63-year-old man named Zhao, holding a small flag, said on the street in an extremely excited tone: "Good days are coming! Now we have welcomed our troops!" (Yu Xiu)

    太谷民主政府入城
    解释政策民心安定
    街闾长积极帮助建立民主秩序
    【太行电】太谷城民主秩序正在积极建立中。民主政府入城后，立即召开全城街闾长会议，宣布群众所欠阎匪之粮款一律停止征收；详细解释我党的各种政策，特别是保护工商业及知识分子政策，安定民心，建立民主秩序。对伪人员宣布凡不持械抗拒人民解放军及民主政府法令者，一律不逮捕，并号召他们悔过自新，为人民服务。过去犯了一般罪过者，只要痛改前非，可以将功赎罪。到会伪人员大受感动，纷纷表示以后要完全听民主政府话，为人民作事。东南街代理街长白伟乘说：“阎锡山的工作员都是官僚，命令叫干啥就得干啥，稍有不到就说是‘伪装’，谁也不敢吭气，八路军的政策好，干部说话是商商量量和和气气的，大家都愿干。”该街第三闾闾长郝应生开会后即积极进行各种登记和调查工作，帮助建立新的民主秩序。
    【太行电】太谷市民热烈欢迎人民解放军及民主政府入城。商号门上遍贴“欢迎解放军”，“毛主席是中国人民的救星”，“拥护民主政府”等各色标语，“拥护毛主席朱总司令，活捉阎锡山”，“打倒勾子军”（老百姓叫阎锡山的十九军是勾子军），“解放全山西”等口号随处可闻。街上热闹的情景，简直使人看不出该城是才解放了的。城内市民自动聚集近三千人，打着锣鼓排成队至东门欢迎解放军及民主政府人员入城。有个六十三岁的赵老汉拿着一面小旗，以极兴奋的口气在街上讲着：“好日子到了，这一下可把咱们的队伍欢迎来啦！”（玉秀）
