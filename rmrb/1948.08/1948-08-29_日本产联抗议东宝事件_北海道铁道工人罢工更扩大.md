Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 26th: Agence France-Presse reports: "Japanese workers are determined to resist the coming oppression." This is a warning to the Japanese government from the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, which has approximately four million members, regarding the Toho incident. The union issued a protest to the Ministry of Labor and the police headquarters, stating: "The Toho incident is the worst example of oppression since Japan's surrender." The union's resolution stated: "Capital is resorting to force, violating the most sacred rights of workers. The workers are angered by this method. We now appeal to the working class of the world."

Furthermore, the Hokkaido railway workers' strike has persisted for two weeks. On the 20th, Japanese Minister of Transportation, Okada Seiichi, issued an ultimatum to the striking workers, demanding a return to work within one day, or "severe punishment" would follow. On the same day, the Japanese authorities also arrested 25 strikers. As of the 20th, the Japanese government had issued 444 arrest warrants. However, neither intimidation nor arrest has been able to stop the strike from proceeding.

According to a TASS report on the 21st, the Hokkaido railway workers' strike has spread to Aomori and Fukushima prefectures in northern Honshu, Japan. On the 20th, 118 trains were suspended in Hokkaido. According to Okada himself, coal transportation has decreased by 10,000 tons per day. One-third of Japan's railways are paralyzed due to strikes and large-scale collective absenteeism.

　　日本产联抗议东宝事件
  　北海道铁道工人罢工更扩大
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】法新社报导：“日本工人决心抵抗来临的压迫”，这是拥有会员约四百万人的日本产业劳动组合联合会伪东宝事件对日本政府的警告。该工会向劳工省及警察本部发出抗议称：“东宝事件是日本投降以来最坏的一个压迫例子”。该工会的决议声称：“资力采用武力，侵犯了工人最神圣的权利。工人们为这种方法所激怒了。我们现向全世界的工人阶级发出呼吁”。又讯：北海道铁道工人的罢工，已坚持两周。二十日，日运输大臣冈田势一向罢工工人发出最后通牒，要求一天内复工，否则“严办”。同一天，日当局并逮捕了罢工者二十五人。迄二十日止，日本政府发出的拘票已达四百四十四张。然而，不论恫吓或逮捕，都不能阻止罢工的进行。据塔斯社廿一日消息，北海道铁道工人的罢工已蔓延至日本本州北部的青森、福岛两县。二十日，北海道的火车有一一八列停驶，据冈田自称：煤的运输量每日减少一万吨。日本三分之一的铁道，正因罢工与大批集体旷工而告瘫痪。
