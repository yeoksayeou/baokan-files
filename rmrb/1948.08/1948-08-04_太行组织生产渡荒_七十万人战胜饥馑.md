    Taihang Organizes Production to Overcome Famine
    700,000 People Conquer Hunger

    [Taihang News] Due to poor harvests in many areas of Taihang last year, coupled with the scourge of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits, the number of disaster victims this spring reached over 730,000. An investigation in 26 villages in Yuanshi County revealed that 22.3% of the total population were starving at the time. In Shangzhuang Village, the 6th District of Pingding, 86% of the total population had no food. Disaster victims in the 5th District of the county reached 78%. Over 300,000 disaster victims were universally eating grass roots and tree bark, fleeing to beg, selling their children and wives, and nearly 10,000 starved to death. Over 50,000 people in the no-man's land of Pingding suffered from illnesses due to the disaster, and 40,000 were sick. In disaster areas of Yuci, Taigu, and Shouyang counties, the labor force was greatly reduced due to disease and displacement. According to statistics last year, the abandoned land in the border areas accounted for 25% to 30%, with the highest reaching over 50%. At the beginning of March, our Border Region Government and Administrative Office first allocated 4.63 million jin of relief grain and issued 1.55 million jin of loan grain and 232.9 million yuan in loans. After mass discussion, the grain and loans were genuinely distributed to the disaster victims in a manner that was neither dispersed nor excessively concentrated, supporting their production. Secondly, we organized work-for-relief projects. For example, the 2nd and 1st Special Districts organized the construction of the Xizan Road and Zuo Xiang Road, and Shexian County built the Aishe Railway, while the 4th Special District Administrative Office managed rivers and reclaimed wasteland. All levels of government agencies and troops initiated saving and disaster relief efforts and distributed charity granaries, raising a total of 108,206.7 jin of millet, 1,124,000 jin of bran and vegetables, and other war spoils and struggle achievements that have not yet been calculated. The Second Sub-district, in conjunction with the emergency relief of loan grain and funds, organized doctors to provide medical treatment to disaster areas at half price or free of charge and launched mass sanitation campaigns. What is particularly important is the large-scale organization of disaster victims to engage in production for self-salvation, with cadres personally taking the lead and all economic departments providing full support. In terms of transportation, the Trade Company organized the import of over 7 million jin of grain, and the Pingding County Cooperative and Finance and Grain Section provided capital to organize three transportation lines specifically for the sale of coal transported by the masses, solving the difficulty of sales. Many district and village cooperatives actively organized mass transportation, greatly facilitating the masses' production for self-salvation. According to statistics from nine counties including Yuci, Taigu, Pingding, Shouyang, Xiyang, Shexian, Yuanshi, Neiqiu, and Gaoyi, transportation income in the past four months totaled the equivalent of 2.36 million jin of millet. In terms of textiles, the Administrative Office allocated millet to support textile production in the First Sub-district. The district's Trade Company and its affiliated stores also issued a large amount of loan cotton and purchased and sold local cloth, expanding textile sales channels. In the past four months, the market alone purchased over 34 million square feet of cloth, leading to the rapid development of the textile movement. Statistics from over 20 counties (excluding the 4th Sub-district) show that over 200,000 women have joined the textile movement. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties, including Yuanshi, Lincheng, Neiqiu, Gaoyi, Shexian, Qixian, and Shouyang, textile income in the past four months totaled the equivalent of 7.905202 million jin of rice. In addition, various localities, based on local conditions, developed various sideline and handicraft productions. In Pingding, Shouyang, Xiyang, Tangyin and other four counties (mainly Pingding and Xiyang), activities such as digging medicinal herbs, boiling saltpeter, cutting mountain goods, the saltpeter industry, and papermaking, etc., in the past four months, the total income was equivalent to 3.875658 million jin of rice. Pingding County, due to the good organization of production for self-salvation, made up for one-third of the county's grain shortage. Statistics from the first and second districts of Yuanshi show that after production for disaster relief, the disaster area was reduced by 58.3%. In Pingding, from the original eight pig iron furnaces in Baidao Hao in November last year, to the end of April, it developed to 38, absorbing 418 workers and completing the production of 1 million jin of pig iron (the income from the 16 furnaces in Tieguo Hao was not calculated). Subsequently, 44 wrought iron furnaces and 520,000 jin of foreign iron bars were produced, which could be exchanged for 725,000 jin of rice. Sixty-nine agricultural tool furnaces produced 491,000 jin of goods, selling for 160 million yuan. Due to the development of iron furnaces, coal mine crucible kilns have also developed accordingly. The first and second districts originally had 11 coal kilns with 280 workers, which have now developed to 24 with 348 workers. The income in the past four months was 892 shi of millet. The development of the coal and iron industry especially requires a large transportation force and a group of hawkers, thus creating broad avenues for production and self-salvation for the disaster victims of Pingding. The victory of production for self-salvation has improved the masses' confidence in production and guaranteed spring plowing and sowing. For example, in Shouyang, despite the serious coal shortage and enemy destruction, the cultivated area has expanded, with a total of over 14,500 mu of barren and cultivated land being reclaimed, and the number of livestock has also increased by 248. This year's sown area, according to statistics from the first, second, and third districts of the county, has increased by over 21,740 mu compared to last year. Other disaster areas have also completed spring plowing and sowing.

    太行组织生产渡荒
    七十万人战胜饥馑
    【太行讯】太行不少地区去年歉收，又加蒋阎匪祸，今春灾民达七十三万余人。元氏县二十六村调查，当时断食的灾民占总人口的百分之二十二点三。平定六区上庄村没吃的灾民占总人口百分之八十六。该县五区灾民达百分之七十八。三十余万灾民普遍吃草根树皮。逃荒乞讨，卖子卖妻，饿死的近万人。平定无人区五万余人，因灾致病者四万。榆次、太谷、寿阳等县灾区群众，因疾病与生活的流离，劳力大大减少。边沿地区荒芜的土地，去年统计在百分之二十五至三十，最高的竟达百分之五十以上。三月初，我边区政府与行署首先拨发了救济粮四百六十三万斤，并将发放的贷粮一百五十五万斤，贷款二万万三千二百九十万元，经过群众讨论，用不分散而又不过份集中的办法真正发放到灾民手里，扶持其生产。其次组织以工代赈。如二专、一专组织修筑昔赞路，左襄路，涉县修筑爱涉铁路，四专署治河垦荒等。各级机关部队发起节约救灾与发放义仓等，共筹措小米十万八千二百零六十七斤，糠菜一百一十二万四千斤，其他利用战争缴获、斗争果实等尚未计算在内。二分区并结合发放贷粮款的急赈，组织医生到灾区半价或无价看病，发动群众清洁运动。特别重要的是大量组织灾民生产自救，干部亲自带头领导，各经济部门全力扶助。在运输上，贸易公司曾组织七百余万斤粮食的进口，平定县联社与财粮科曾拿出资本组织三条运输线，专门吞吐群众运输之煤炭，解决销路困难。许多区村合作社积极组织群众运输，给群众生产自救以很大方便。现据榆次、太谷、平定、寿阳、昔阳、涉县、元氏、内邱、高邑等九县统计，四个月来运输收入共计折合小米二百三十六万斤。在纺织上，行署曾拨小米支持一分区纺织。该区贸易公司及所属各商店亦大量发贷棉花，并收卖土布，扩大了纺织销路。四个月内仅在市场上即收布三千四百余万平方尺，因而纺织运动迅速开展。二十余县（四分区除外）统计，有二十余万妇女投入纺织运动，据元氏、临城、内邱、高邑、涉县、淇县、寿阳等七个县不完全统计，四个月来，纺织收入共折米七百九十万零五千二百零二斤。另外，各地依据当地条件，发展各种副业手工业生产。平定、寿阳、昔阳、汤阴等四县（主要是平定、昔阳），刨药材、熬硝、砍山货、硝业、造纸等生产，四个月来共收入折米三百八十七万五千六百五十八斤。平定由于生产自救组织的好，补足了全县缺粮的三分之一；元氏一、二两区统计，经过生产救灾，灾区缩小了百分之五十八点三。平定从去年十一月由原有生铁炉八道壕，到四月底发展到三十八道，吸收工人四百一十八名，完成一百万斤生铁生产（铁锅十六道壕的收入未计算）。随着又发展了熟铁炉四十四盘，洋棍炉出货五十二万斤，可换米七十二万五千斤。农具炉六十九座，出货四十九万一千斤，卖洋一万万六千万元。由于铁炉的发展，煤炭矿坩窑亦随之发展。一、二区原有煤炭窑十一座，工人二百八十名，现发展为二十四座，工人三百四十八名。四个月收入小米八百九十二石。煤铁业的发展，尤需要大批运输力量及一批小贩，因此给平定的灾民创造出广大的生产自救门路。生产自救的胜利，提高了群众生产信心，保证了春耕下种。如寿阳在严重煤荒和敌人的破坏下，耕地面积扩大，生荒熟荒共开了一万四千五百余亩，亦增加牲口二百四十八头。今年下种面积，据该县一、二、三等三个区统计，比去年增加二万一千七百四十余亩。其他各灾区亦都完成春耕下种。
