　　【Taihang News】 After re-organization, the cooperative in the Third District of Pingshun became gradually active. Since June 19th, the district held a joint meeting of branch secretaries, studied the district Party committee's letter to party members and farmers, researched various policies, and, combining with the district's actual situation, discussed and recognized the error of the past one-sided view of the poor and hired peasants, initially stabilizing the mood of the cadres. Following this, they specifically studied sideline production, proposing: "To make up for last year's poor harvest, we can only re-organize the cooperative, organize sideline production, and then can we overcome the disaster and become prosperous." After the joint meeting of branches, the district took Wangjiazhuang (land reform experimental village) as the base point for rectifying the cooperative, gained experience, and promoted it throughout the district. The village first convened a symposium of representatives, cooperative cadres, and main village cadres to study rectification methods. It was found that the problems existing in the cooperative were: 1. Cadres were ideologically confused and dared not act. Deputy Director Wang Dexian said: "The poor and hired peasants are in charge, but the cooperative's debts cannot be recovered, and we are not capable enough to earn money." Cooperative cadre Wang Yu said: "We are middle peasants, and we cannot participate in the poor peasant associations. What can one person do?" 2. The share capital was more than 689,000 yuan, but the outstanding debts reached more than 700,000 yuan, causing operational difficulties. After studying policies and clarifying the thinking of cadres, the accountant was asked to settle and announce the accounts for the first half of the year: a total profit of 650,000 yuan, but outstanding debts, including loans, totaled 830,000 yuan. This figure attracted the attention of the masses, who discussed the cooperative's problems. The leadership immediately convened a meeting of cooperative members, proposing: The cooperative has achieved results in leading production in the past, but what can be done if the debts cannot be recovered? Everyone immediately started a discussion and was very concerned about the issue of outstanding debts. Three methods for repaying outstanding debts were discussed: 1. Those with money should pay money, and those without money should pay whatever they have, priced at market value to offset the money. 2. Those without money or goods should organize labor to earn work points for the cooperative to repay the debt. 3. Widows and orphans without money, goods, or labor should crack apricot kernels for the cooperative to earn money to repay the debt. Everyone at the meeting agreed with this method, and the masses proposed to abide by it voluntarily. More than 600,000 yuan of debts were cleared in five days. The remaining more than 100,000 yuan owed by widows and orphans with no labor are also being cleared through production methods. The cooperative immediately changed, and the confidence of the cadres was also improved.
    The Wangjiazhuang method was quickly spread to various villages. When Niuling was clearing outstanding debts, some individuals wanted to exchange the money earned from cracking apricot kernels for rice. The cooperative resolutely collected the debts, and after recovering the debts, it organized them to produce and earn money, which the masses strongly supported. Other villages also used this method and cleared their outstanding debts in three to five days. This year, most villages in the district have suffered from floods again, and the cooperative is organizing the masses to carry out various sideline productions to save themselves.

　　组织生产清理外欠
  　王家庄取得整顿合作社经验
    【太行讯】平顺三区合作社重新整顿后逐渐活跃起来。自六月十九日，该区召开支书联席会，学习区党委告党员、农民书，研究了各种政策，并结合该区实际情况进行了讨论后，认识了过去片面贫雇观点的错误，初步稳定了干部情绪。接着即专门研究副业生产，提出：“要想弥补去年歉收，只有重新整顿合作社，组织副业生产，才能战胜灾荒，发家致富”。支联会后，该区即以王家庄（土改实验村）为整顿合作社基点，取得经验，推广全区。该村首先召开了人代会委员、合作干部、村主要干部座谈会，研究整顿办法。发现合作社存在的问题是：一、干部思想混乱不敢干。副社长王得贤说：“贫雇当家哩，欠合作社款要不回来，咱能力不行赚不上钱”。合作干部王瑜说：“咱是中农成份，咱也不能参加贫农团，一人能干个啥？”二、股金六十八万九千余元，外欠即达七十余万，造成营业困难。经过学习政策，澄清干部思想后，即让会计把前半年的帐结算公布：共赚红利六十五万，但外欠连贷款共八十三万元。这个数字引起群众的注意，纷纷酝酿合作社问题。领导上当即召开了社员大会，提出：合作社过去领导生产有成绩，可是要不回帐来怎么办？大家当即展开讨论，对外欠问题非常关心。讨论出归还外欠的三个办法：一、有钱交钱，没钱有啥交啥，按市价作价顶钱。二、没钱没货者组织劳力给社内送脚赚钱还帐。三、没钱没货又没劳力之孤寡，给合作社敲杏核等赚钱还帐。这个办法到会人都很同意，群众都提出自动遵守，五天清帐六十余万元，下剩没劳力孤寡户十余万元，也正在以生产办法进行清理。合作社马上变了样，干部信心也提高了。
    王家庄办法很快传到了各村。牛岭在清理外欠时，有个别人想把敲杏核赚的钱换米吃，合作社坚决的收帐，将帐要回后，即组织他们生产赚钱，群众非常拥护。其他各村也运用这个办法，在三、五天内清理了外欠。该区今年大部村又遭水患，合作社正组织群众进行各种副业生产自救。
