    Attempting to Suppress Burma's Powerful Independence Movement
    British Imperialism Prepares to Organize a Fifth Column
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th】 A dispatch from the Telegraphic Communication Agency from London at the end of July reported: The British Far East Defense Deployment Committee is continuing to closely monitor the situation in Malaya. The establishment of the aforementioned body is to implement the resolution of the last Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting in Washington regarding the British military reoccupying Malaya. In the Washington meeting, the American side accused the British government of allowing Malaya and Burma to have nominal independence as a "failed experiment." The American side demanded that this "experiment" be abandoned as soon as possible, because the Malay Peninsula is of considerable importance to the United States' strategic plans. The Telegraphic Communication Agency continued, stating that Britain's plan for Burma is not much different from its plan for Malaya, but in order to resist Burma's relatively strong independence movement, the British are preparing to organize a fifth column in Burma. The arrival of former Burmese Foreign Minister U Tin Tut in Britain is related to this matter.

    妄图镇压缅甸强大独立运动
    英帝准备组织第五纵队
    【新华社陕北七日电】电报通讯社七月底自伦敦报导：英国远东防务部署委员会正在继续密切注视马来亚情势。上述机构的成立，系负责执行上次华盛顿参谋总长联席会议关于英军重占马来亚的决议，在华盛顿会议中，美方曾指斥英国政府之允许予马来亚及缅甸以名义上的独立是“失败了的实验”。美方要求尽早废弃这一“实验”，因为马来半岛对于美国的战略计划有颇大的重要性。电通社继称，英国对缅甸的计划与对马来亚的计划差异甚微，但为了抗击缅甸的较为强大的独立运动，英方准备在缅甸组织第五纵队。缅甸前外交部长宇丁图之抵达英国，系与此事有关。
