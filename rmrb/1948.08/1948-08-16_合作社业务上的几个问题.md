　　Several Issues Concerning Cooperative Business
    During the reorganization of cooperatives, several key issues in business operations must be addressed simultaneously:

    I. Currently, cooperatives engaged in production must grasp the characteristics of rural side occupations and correctly determine their operational guidelines in order to achieve universal and sound development. For example, the production of mulberry bark paper in Linqu County relies primarily on agricultural production, utilizing idle time during the agricultural off-season and rainy days. Several individuals pool capital and labor to cooperate in the business. They own some of the raw materials themselves and purchase the rest through relatives and friends in the neighborhood. They have fixed vendors for sales and do not require managerial staff who are detached from production. During the harsh winter, when paper-making is impossible, they gather firewood to burn lime for the whole year’s use. Therefore, the cash cost of the entire mulberry bark paper production only accounts for 20 percent, while the rest is labor income. This is the fundamental reason why mulberry bark paper can be manufactured for a long time. However, we often forcibly combine existing backward production technologies and tools into factories and workshops, establishing managerial positions with high salaries and benefits, resulting in high costs and low product quality, which makes it difficult to sell. Especially in the first half of the year, we did not proceed from the actual conditions in rural areas, but subjectively and unilaterally raised wages for side occupations. The government decided that spinning wages should be one-third higher than general wages and should be paid entirely in grain. Each jin (approximately 500g) of thread was calculated at four workdays, with each workday's wage grain at a maximum of 2.4 jin, a middle rate of 2.2 jin, and a minimum of 1.14 jin. Shoemaking wages were higher than textile wages, with each pair of shoes calculated at six workdays, and each workday's wage grain at a maximum of 2.12 jin, a middle rate of 2.5 jin, and a minimum of 2.4 jin. Public transportation costs were higher than general transportation prices and even higher than agricultural wages. This not only increased public financial expenditure but also encouraged agricultural labor to shift to side occupations, which has led to rising wages in other side occupations, affecting their operations and leading to price increases. At the same time, due to increased production costs and reduced sales, cooperative workshops could not continue their operations due to continuous losses. In April, due to the narrow sales channels for cloth and the government's decision to increase wages, the Yibei Cooperative lost 14,870 yuan for each bolt of cloth woven. As a result, 20 cooperative workshops closed down. Half of the 28 textile cooperatives in Zhao Hu District of Anqiu County also closed, and many others in other counties shut down. Productive laborers did not gain much benefit but instead lost the hope of employment. This error should be promptly corrected.

    II. Cooperatives should be allowed to freely conduct business according to the production and livelihood needs of the masses, without restrictions as long as they do not violate government regulations. To date, we still subjectively advocate taking certain businesses as the primary focus, assigning one type of business to cooperatives and prohibiting them from engaging in other types of businesses. In Hanwang District of Yibei County, people who wanted to weave mats were asked to spin yarn; in Linqu County, those who wanted to burn lime were asked to spin yarn; and in Yizhong County, those who wanted to pan for gold were asked to spin yarn. These actions were all generated under the guideline of focusing on textile production. Since the business was designated by the government, they believed it was for the public and that the public sector had to purchase the finished products, giving up the idea of selling them in the market. This business guidance policy violates the laws of social and economic development and is a manifestation of paternalistic control. The business scope of cooperatives should not be limited to one type of production but can engage in diversified production according to different seasons. Chairman Mao proposed ten cooperative businesses several years ago: industry, agriculture, transportation, animal husbandry, supply and marketing, health, credit, education, tree planting, and public welfare. We can engage in these activities in a planned way according to the level of awareness and possible conditions of the masses. Especially in order to overcome the current war wounds and conquer disasters, cooperatives should strive to participate in the work of restoring and developing agricultural production and promoting rural economic prosperity. On the one hand, develop various rural side occupations, providing assistance in all aspects, such as loans, investments, purchasing tools and raw materials, and selling finished products on behalf of producers. On the other hand, engage in and develop agricultural production businesses as much as possible, such as manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools, supplying seeds, introducing and cultivating improved varieties, promoting agricultural technology improvement, protecting and breeding livestock, organizing water conservancy construction, and eliminating diseases and pests. In this way, cooperatives will have a broad field for business operation and development.

    III. Develop production in a planned way to gradually overcome blindness. Currently, rural production cannot be as scientific, precise, and accurate as the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plans, but we should still try our best to grasp the economic characteristics of rural areas during wartime and understand market laws, such as the needs of local farmers, the needs of people in cities and neighboring areas, and the needs of the government, and pay attention to studying them regularly to determine production plans, so as to avoid overproduction or complete reliance on public sector purchase. As long as we can strive for inexpensive raw materials, appropriately adjust wages, save expenses, reduce costs, and improve quality to open up market sales, then cooperative production and operation will surely develop soundly.

### 合作社业务上的几个问题

　　合作社业务上的几个问题
    在整理合作社中，必须同时解决业务上的几个关键问题：
    一、目前合作社经营生产，必须掌握农村副业的特点，正确决定经营方针，才能普遍的健全发展。例如临朐的桑皮纸，就是以农业生产为主，利用农闲空隙和下雨时间来造纸，几个人合资共同出劳力来合作经营，自己有一部分原料，并通过四邻亲友关系代购，有固定小贩代销，不用脱离生产的管理人员，严冬不能捞纸时，就拾柴火烧石灰，准备全年使用，因而，桑皮纸的全部价格，现金成本只占百分之二十，其他都是劳动收入，这是桑皮纸能长期制造的基本原因。然而，我们往往将现有落后的生产技术和工具，勉强凑合成工厂作坊，设一些管理人员，生活待遇不低，开支很大，成本高而成品质量不高，就很难推销。特别在上半年，我们不从农村实际情况出发，主观片面的提高副业工资，政府决定纺线工资高于一般工资三分之一，并一律改为以粮食支付。每斤线以四个工计算，每工最高二斤四两，中间二斤二两，最低一斤十四两；做鞋工资高于纺织工资，一双鞋以六个工计，每工工资粮最高二斤十二两，中间二斤半，最低二斤四两；公家运输高于一般运输价，更高于农业工资，这不但是增多了公家财政开支，而且是在鼓动农业劳动力转向副业，并已引起其他副业工资上涨，影响其经营及物价上涨。同时，由于生产品成本提高，销路减少，合作社作坊因不断赔本而不能继续维持经营。四月份的纺织业，由于布匹销路狭小，又政府决定提高工资，沂北合作社织一匹布赔本一万四千八百七十元。因此，合作社停业者二十处。安邱召忽区二十八处纺织社亦停了一半，其他县关门停业者不少。生产劳动者没有得多少好处，反而丧失了就业的希望，这一错误应该迅速纠正。
    二、要让合作社自由地根据群众生产上生活上的需要来经营业务，在不违反政府法规范围以内，不应加以限制。至目前为止，我们还是主观的提倡以什么业务为主，指定一种业务给合作社干，不许经营另一种业务。沂北韩旺区要编席的群众去纺织；临朐要烧石灰的去纺织；沂中要淘金的去纺织。这些都是在纺织生产为主的方针下产生的。既是政府定的业务，就使他们认为给公家办，非公家收购成品不可，不再打算在市场上推销。这种业务指导方针，是违反社会经济发展法则，也是包办代替的一种表现。合作社业务内容，不应限于一种生产，可根据不同季节经营多样性生产。毛主席在几年前提出十项合作业务：工业、农业、运输、畜牧、供销、卫生、信用、教育、植树、公益等，我们都可根据群众觉悟程度和可能条件，有计划的经营。尤其是为了克服目前的战争创伤和战胜灾荒，合作社应努力参加恢复发展农业生产繁荣农村经济的工作。一方面发展各种农村副业，给以各方面帮助，如贷款、投资，代买工具原料，代销生产成品等：另一方面，尽可能经营发展农业生产的业务，如农具制造、修理，供给种子，移入及培养良种，推广农业技术改良，保护繁殖牲畜，组织水利建设，除病虫害等。这样，合作社就有业务经营发展的宽阔园地了。
    三、有计划发展生产，逐渐克服盲目性。目前农村生产还不可能象苏联的五年计划那般科学精密准确，但亦要尽可能掌握战时的农村的经济特点，掌握市场规律，如当地农民的需要，城市及邻区人民的需要，和政府的需要等，都经常注意研究，来决定生产计划，才不致生产过多，或完全仰赖公家包办收购。只要我们能争取廉价原料，适当调节工资，节省开支，减轻成本，提高质量，以打开市场销路，则合作社生产经营必能健全地发展起来的。　　　　【新华社电】
