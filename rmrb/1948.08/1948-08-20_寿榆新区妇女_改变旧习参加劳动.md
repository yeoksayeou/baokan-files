　　Women in the New Shouyu District
  　Change Old Habits and Participate in Labor
    [Beiyue News] The Shou (Yang) Yu (Ci) area is vast, and the people's lives are relatively prosperous. In the past, most women did not participate in labor. During the enemy and puppet occupation, social customs deteriorated day by day. Women lived by "wearing out their husbands, eating off their husbands, and marrying another husband after their husband died." They considered labor to be a disgrace. In recent years, due to the enemy's conscription and plunder, and exorbitant taxes, the people's lives have been very difficult, but most women are still unwilling to participate in labor. This May, our army liberated Shouyang again. In order to promote production and address this mindset among women, we conducted widespread propaganda and education, pointing out that "not working is a disgrace" and advocating "participating in production to improve life." Women's old habits have gradually changed. Women hoeing the fields and picking seedlings is now a common phenomenon. In many villages, women have become the main force of labor. According to statistics from thirty-six administrative villages, out of 3,440 women who are able to work, 2,643 have participated in production. In Dadong Village in the Seventh District, 90% of the women have participated in production. In Yan Shoumei's production team in Qilihe, four people picked seedlings on ten mu of land in four days. Her own ten mu of land, without livestock, was all managed through labor exchange. She said happily, "Labor exchange is good, it's lively and engaging; otherwise, ten mu of land couldn't be planted all at once." Zhai Shang Village in the Fifth District suffered the most from the floods. Except for the elderly, weak, and disabled, all the women went to the fields. Zhang Jinfeng and five others from Ge@ Village planted 106 mu of land and also reclaimed six mu of wasteland. Li Genlian, Tao Yinxi, and Li Cun'e from Taiping Village voluntarily formed a labor exchange group, received 1.4 shi of grain from the government, solved their livelihood difficulties, and were in high spirits. They said, "The government cares about us so much, we must work hard." Twenty-seven mu of thirty mu of black beans were quickly planted. The women of Shouyu are not only very active in production in the fields, but also take time to spin and weave during the slack season. In the Guangniu Village area, more than 600 women have been organized for spinning and weaving, solving many livelihood difficulties. The widespread participation of women in labor has freed up many men to engage in other production. The women of Zhang Village and Qilihe have personally experienced that after the land is planted and the crops grow well, life is better. When they carry their hoes on the street, they are not ashamed, but feel honored. The women of Yequepo have always been "wearing fashionable clothes and walking to see their shadows," and the atmosphere was very bad. At first, after repeated mobilization, they always couldn't bring themselves to carry the hoe. After collective education and individual talks, and with Wang San as the backbone, a group was organized to hoe seedlings, and they began to take action. Through continuous education and labor, their lives have gradually become simpler, and their style has gradually changed. A new atmosphere has emerged in the women's production throughout Shouyu. Many people reflect that "this year's women are a great help." Su Henian of Qilihe said, "In previous years, during the busy season of weeding seedlings, no one would do it for two sheng of rice a day. This year, we weeded through without hiring anyone."

　　寿榆新区妇女
  　改变旧习参加劳动
    【北岳讯】寿（阳）榆（次）地面广阔，群众生活比较富裕，过去一般妇女都不参加劳动。敌伪占领时，社会风气日坏，妇女坐穿坐吃，“穿汉子，吃汉子，死了汉子嫁汉子”的思想很浓厚，把劳动认为是一种耻辱。几年来由于敌人抓丁抢掠，横征暴敛，群众生活非常困难，但大部妇女仍不愿参加劳动。今年五月我军再次解放寿阳，为了提倡生产，针对妇女这种思想，普遍进行宣传教育，指出“不劳动是耻辱”，提倡“参加生产，改善生活”，妇女们的旧习惯逐渐改变了。妇女锄地拣苗现在已成普遍现象。不少村庄妇女成为劳动的主力军。据三十六个行政村的统计，能劳动的妇女三千四百四十人中，参加了生产的有二千六百四十三人；七区大东庄百分之九十的妇女参加了生产。七里河阎守梅生产小组，四个人四天拣谷苗十亩，她自己的十亩地，没有牲口都是靠变工种上的，她高兴的说：“还是变工好，又红火，又待动；要不是十亩地可一下种不上”。五区翟上庄受阎灾最严重，妇女们除老弱残废外都上了地。圪＠村张金凤等五人种了一百零六亩地，还开了六亩荒。太平村李根莲、桃银喜、李存娥三人，自动结了变工组，得到政府一石四斗贷粮，解决了生活困难，情绪很高，她们说：“公家这样关心咱，咱们可得好好受哩”。三十亩黑豆很快就种了二十七亩。寿榆的妇女们不但在田地里生产很积极，在农闲时还抽时间纺线、织布，光牛村一带就组织了六百多个妇女进行纺织，解决了不少生活困难。妇女们普遍的参加了劳动，省出男人不少工从事其他生产。张村和七里河的妇女亲身体验到地种上了，庄稼长的很好，生活也比较好过了，扛上锄在大街上走时，不但不害羞，还觉得很光荣。野雀坡妇女们一向是“穿衣撵时髦，走路看影子”，风气很坏，开始再三动员，锄头总是扛不出去，继经集体教育，个别谈话，并以王三为骨干组织起一个组来锄苗，才开始行动起来。在不断的教育和劳动中，现在她们的生活逐渐朴素了，作风逐渐转变了。整个寿榆的妇女生产呈现了一种新气象。不少群众反映说：“今年的女人们可顶上大事了”。七里河苏何年说：“往年锄苗忙时，一天二升米也没人干，今年没雇人也就锄过了”。
