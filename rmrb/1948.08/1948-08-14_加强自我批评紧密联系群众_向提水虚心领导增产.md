Strengthening Self-Criticism, Closely Connecting with the Masses
　　Learning from Xiang Tishui with an Open Mind, and Leading Increased Production
　　Unraveling Party Members’ Ideological Knots＠, Leading the Masses to Formulate Plans
　　[Taihang News] Since the publication of the deeds of Xiang Tishui, a labor hero and model Party member from Shili Village, Huguan, and the commendation of him by the Taihang Third Prefectural Committee, his attitude has become more humble and cautious, and his work has become more conscientious. He heard some people's reactions, "They just criticized him, but now they're publishing articles praising him." He thought: Even if only one person is dissatisfied, it's worth paying attention to myself. After that, he paid great attention to his style of work. No matter what he did, he always listened to the opinions of the masses first. After expressing his own opinions, he always said, "My feeling is this, let's discuss it..." He accepted the opinions of the masses very humbly. He said to the masses, "Although I wanted everyone to be well in the past, my attitude was blunt, and sometimes it didn't suit everyone's tastes. If everyone wanted to eat garlic, I would insist on adding vinegar. I must change this in the future. I feel that everyone's criticism of me is out of love for me. It's to make me a truly good material, to straighten a bent wire (referring to the masses transforming him)." He said, "The commendation from the higher authorities is everyone's achievement. One person cannot be called a hero, and two people cannot be called good fellows. The achievement is everyone's, and I only got the name. The commendation from the higher authorities is to ask me to discuss things well with the masses and do things for everyone." He made several self-criticisms and explanations at mass meetings. Some incorrect ideas of a few people were overcome, and the masses supported him even more. Everyone said, "If it weren't for the hero's leadership in the first month of the year, we wouldn't be able to finish delivering manure and things would have been terrible."
　　After the Party rectification in the village, there was insufficient ideological education for Party member cadres and the masses. Some problems have occurred in recent practical work, and a few people have shown a kind of anarchistic, anti-leadership, extreme democratic tendency. When the cadres urged the masses to apply topdressing fertilizer, some people said, "Don't bother us, we'll do it if we want to, and we won't do it if we don't want to!" Some cadres and Party members did not thoroughly solve their ideological problems and were hesitant to lead. When the village shifted to large-scale production, a few cadres and Party members were afraid that the masses would say that they had committed administrative orders and subjectivity again after the Party rectification, and they did not dare to boldly help the masses formulate production plans. They were afraid of being said to have a bad attitude if they gave the masses an opinion. They wanted to be a good old man in front of the masses, and they dared not approve of the good or oppose the bad. Some even followed the extreme democratic tendencies among the masses, and some had internal disagreements among Party members. Xiang Tishui discovered these situations. In order to concentrate on leading the masses in production, he convened a meeting of cadres and Party members in mid-July. First, he talked about the reasons why these people were not working actively. Party member Fu Shun said, "I think the masses have risen up and want democracy. I don't know whether we are urging the masses or the masses are urging us. Sometimes, we push everyone to do it, and if they don't do it, it's okay. Later, I stopped coming forward." Party member cadres said many similar things. Everyone discussed at the meeting whether these views were correct or not. Xiang Tishui finally summarized everyone's opinions and said, "We can't just not speak when the masses are speaking. As long as it's for the benefit of the masses, we must express our opinions in order to play a correct leading role." In response to the problem that some people did not dare to lead the masses in formulating plans, Tishui said, "Not to mention our village's work, even driving a pair of oxen out, there must be a leader. Without a plan, there is no goal. We have a plan for walking: where to have lunch, where to stay overnight, and when to return. Plans are very necessary; otherwise, we will be walking blindly and will 'go wrong'. Working is like hoeing the ground, you can't be afraid of damaging the hoe and not dare to hoe the ground." Everyone studied his opinion and unanimously clarified that if they wanted to do a good job, they had to lead well. One Party member said, "It's wrong for a Communist Party member to be afraid of offending people and not working. I will still work actively. As long as I change my shortcomings and persuade and mobilize the masses, once is not enough, twice; twice is not enough, three times; if three times is not enough, four or five times. As long as the opinion is correct and we follow the mass line, we can do a good job and not offend anyone. To tell the truth, we can give opinions to anyone who does something wrong." Some unprincipled small disputes among Party members were revealed at the meeting, and they were resolved on the spot. Tishui said, "We are holding a harmonious meeting. Our previous work was not bad, mainly because the Party members, cadres, and the masses were very united. If there are any opinions, it's good to talk them through. As long as we work hard in the future, the masses will support us." After this meeting, the situation where Party member cadres did not dare to work obviously changed. During the topdressing fertilizer movement, Party member cadres discovered that some masses did not apply manure to the fields. After investigation, they learned that they wanted to keep it for applying to the wheat fields later. Tishui explained to everyone at the mass meeting, "Increasing grain depends on manure. The fields need topdressing fertilizer now. If everyone keeps it for wheat fields, let's calculate. There are still more than two months before planting wheat. There's no worry about not accumulating manure for the wheat fields." Everyone agreed with this opinion and discussed the manure accumulation method. The village has 160 head of livestock. Each head can tread 30 loads per day, and 1,080 loads can be accumulated in two months. There are more than 160 toilets, and more than 3,200 loads can be accumulated in two months. If that's not enough, wasteland can be reclaimed, soil can be laid, and Artemisia can be cut. If the manure at home is not applied now, the red water will flow away after it rains and there will be no smell. Even if it is applied to the wheat fields, it will not be useful. After this calculation and discussion, the masses agreed with Xiang Tishui's opinion. At the meeting, the model examples of Ma You and Wang Ze's groups for hoeing twice and applying topdressing fertilizer were commended. Finally, everyone proposed the slogan of "no manure left in the whole village," formulated a plan for a ten-day blitz to hoe twice, apply topdressing fertilizer, and weed corn, and also prepared to prepare the vegetable plots in advance and prepare to sow vegetable seeds after the rain. Soon after, the village had heavy rain, and the masses enthusiastically strove to complete their plans.

　　加强自我批评紧密联系群众
  　向提水虚心领导增产
    解开党员思想圪＠领导群众订出计划
    【太行讯】自从报纸上发表了壶关十里村劳动英雄模范党员向提水的事迹和太行三地委对他的表扬后，他的态度更加虚心谨慎，工作也更认真起来。他听到一些人“刚整了他，却又登报说好哩”的反映，想道：就是有一个人不满意，也值得自己提起注意。此后他在作风上非常注意，无论办个啥事总是先听取群众的意见，而他自己发表了意见以后，总是这样说：“我的感觉是这样，大家讨论一下………。”他接受群众意见很虚心，他对群众说：“我以前虽是想叫大家好，可是态度生硬，有时不适合大家口味，大家要吃蒜，我非给添醋不行。今后我一定要改，我感觉大家给我提意见是爱护我，是要我真正成个好材料，是把弯了的铁丝拉直（指群众改造他）”。他说：“上级表扬我，这是大家的成绩，一人称不起英雄，二人称不得好汉，成绩是大家的，我只应了个名。上级表扬我，是要我和群众好好商量，给大家办事。”他几次在群众会上作了自我批评和解释，少数群众一些不正确的想法被克服了，群众对他更加拥护。都说：“今年正月不是英雄领导，粪送不完才要糟糕。”
    该村整党后，对党员干部和群众进行思想教育不够，在最近的实际工作中发生了一些问题，少数人表现了一种无政府不要领导的极端民主倾向。干部督促群众上追肥时，有些人说：“不要你管，想做就做，不想做就不做！”有些干部党员没有彻底解决了思想问题，缩手缩脚不敢领导。在该村转上大生产时，有少数干部党员怕群众说自己整过党了又犯行政命令和主观，不敢大胆帮助群众订生产计划。给群众提个意见又怕说自己态度不好。他们想在群众面前落个老好人，见好的不敢赞成，见坏的不敢反对。有的还随着群众中的极端民主倾向跑，有些在党员间互相闹意见。向提水发现了这些情形，为了集中精力好好领导群众生产，在七月中旬召开了干部党员会议，先谈这些人不积极工作的原因。党员付顺说：“我想群众起来了，要民主，作工作也不知是咱督促群众还是群众督促咱，有时推动大家干就干，不干就算。后来我就不出头了”。党员干部说了很多类似的话。大家在会上讨论了这些观点对不对？向提水最后归纳大家的意见说：“咱们不能群众都说话了咱不说话，只要是为了群众利益，有意见就要提，这样才能起正确领导作用。”针对有些人不敢领导群众订计划的问题，提水说：“不用说咱是一个村的工作，就是赶一犋牲口出去，还得有个领头的哩。不订计划就没目标。咱走路还有个计划：哪里打尖，哪里住店，哪日到哪日就回，计划都很必要；要不就是瞎走，就要‘走错’。作工作和锄地一样，不能怕坏了锄不敢去锄地。”大家研究了他这个意见，一致明确了想把工作搞好，还得好好领导才行。一个党员说：“共产党员怕惹人不工作是不对的。我还要积极干，只要自己改了毛病，说服动员群众，一次不行二次，二次不行三次，再不行四次五次，只要意见正确，走的是群众路线，就能做好工作又得罪不了人。要说真理哩，谁做的不对也能提意见。”党员中有些无原则的小纠纷，在会上说透了心思，当场就解开了。提水说：“咱们开的是和气会，咱们以前工作不坏，主要是党员干部群众都很齐心。如有意见，大家谈通就好啦。咱以后只要好好干，群众是拥护咱的。”经过这次会议，党员干部不敢作工作的情形显然有了转变。在上追肥运动中，党员干部发现有些群众有粪不往地里送，经过调查了解，知道是想留在以后往麦地里上。提水在群众大会给大家解释说：“增加粮食靠粪土，现在地里正需上追肥，大家要把它留着上麦地用，大家算算帐，离种麦地还有两个多月，不愁积不上麦地粪。”大家同意了这个意见，又讨论了积肥办法，该村有牲口一百六十头，每头每日踩三十担，两个月能积一千零八十担；一百六十多个厕所，两月可积三千二百多担。再不够，熏荒垫土割蒿都能赶上。现在家里的粪不上了，天一下雨，流了红水就没臭味了，就是上到麦地也不顶事。经过这样计算讨论，群众同意了向提水的意见。会上表扬了马有和王则两个小组锄二遍上追肥的模范榜样。最后大家提出“全村不留一担粪”的行动口号，订了十天突击锄二遍、上追粪、耨玉茭的计划，并要预先整理好菜地，准备雨后撒菜籽。不久该村下了大雨，群众热烈的争取完成自己的计划。
