　　Datong-Puzhou Railway Yuci-Jiexiu Section
  　Officially Reopened to Traffic
    Xinhua News Agency, North China, 23rd – The Yuci-Jiexiu section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway was recently repaired and officially reopened to traffic. The Jiexiu-Lingshi section will also be repaired and opened soon. Car, engineering, locomotive, and electrical workers, as well as scattered employees from various sections of the line, have also returned one after another to register and resume work. During the Jinzhong Campaign in mid-July, the defending enemy in various places forced the railway workers to completely destroy all tracks, vehicles, and iron structures, but the workers protected them in every possible way, welcoming the People's Liberation Army. As soon as the battle ended, under the leadership of the Datong-Puzhou Railway Jinzhong Section Management Committee, they braved the scorching heat and actively carried out restoration work. The section from Taigu to Dongguan (belonging to Qixian), which was demolished by the enemy, was repaired and reopened to traffic on the evening of the 17th of last month.

　　同蒲路榆次介休段
  　正式修复通车
    【新华社华北二十三日电】同蒲铁路榆次、介休段已于日前修复正式通车。介休、灵石段不日亦可修通。该路车务、工务、机务、电气及各段走散员工亦已络续返回进行登记，恢复工作。上月中旬晋中战役中，各地守敌曾迫令该路员工彻底破坏一切车路辆及铁建筑，但员工们多方守护，迎接解放军。并于战斗甫告结束时，即在我同蒲铁路晋中段管理委员会领导下，冒着酷暑，积极进行恢复工作。其中被敌拆毁之太谷到东观（祁县属）段，于上月十七日晚即修复通车。
