Dead End
——Diary of a Kuomintang Battalion Commander

On June 15th of this year, the 3rd Battalion, 471st Regiment, 157th Division of the Kuomintang bandit 62nd Army, was annihilated by our army in Rengezhuang, north of Tangshan. Battalion Commander He Chunbin was captured. The following are excerpts from his diary from late August of last year to June of this year.

	Confessions of Plunder, Deception, Theft, and Robbery

	September 21, 1947: A batch of new recruits arrived, all "grabbed" from my hometown (referring to Guangdong). I am very afraid that my younger brother is among them; my heart is pounding. December 10: Because of the army’s requisitioning, I used deception. I really feel that I have failed as a soldier. (?) But what else could I do? Knowing it is deception, I can only deceive. December 13: In the afternoon, I returned to the village to camp. The poor state of military discipline is hard to describe. December 29: Yesterday, I captured a soldier from the Special Service Platoon who had taken pigs and sheep from the civilians. January 7, 1948: Passing through Fengrun City, the military discipline was very poor. Like this, we are only doing propaganda for the Communist Party. January 16: In the evening, I received a phone call from Song Delin, stating that several soldiers speaking Cantonese in the south of Dongbeitang area had robbed civilians of 2.5 million yuan. January 22: Because some soldiers were selling fuel, I personally went to Xinhe marshalling yard after breakfast to arrest them and caught two people. February 22: Song's unit (referring to one of his battalion's companies) went to Fuzhangzhuang. Yesterday, the village was robbed clean by the Third District Self-Defense Force (referring to the Kuomintang gang), and both people and livestock were taken, and half of the houses were burned down. What mistakes did they commit? Only God knows. On one hand, we are suppressing "bandits," and on the other hand, we are creating "" [bandits]. When will we ever be able to suppress them?

	Trembling with Fear, Unable to Sleep at Night

	February 25, 1948: I dared not sleep last night, lying down with my clothes on until 10 PM before sleeping in my pajamas. At 1:30 AM today, I was awakened by the sound of dogs. I quickly put on my clothes and checked the sentry posts. The sound of dogs came from east to south, then west to north. At around 1:20 AM, it suddenly became silent. I judged that it was not an enemy (referring to the People's Liberation Army) attack. At around 3 AM, I took off my clothes and went back to sleep. May 20: Last night, there were heavy explosions in the northeast and northwest corners. I expected that some strongholds and transportation lines were "harmed" (destroyed) again. The battle village was also attacked by the enemy, making me unable to sleep all night. This "third-class meal" is really hard to eat. May 30: Explosions were frequently heard in the distance at night, making me unable to fall asleep. May 31: We were attacked by the enemy last night, and I couldn't sleep all night. I still couldn't sleep during the day. January 6, 1948: A slight breeze made the weather feel very cold. At dawn, more than 200 people were found rushing toward me from a village. So, I shelled them. They were friendly troops (Kuomintang troops). May 19: At 0:30 this morning, we advanced to Jianzigu, encircled dozens of enemies, but they escaped, and we misunderstood, killing one and wounding two ourselves. That's a pity.

	Ominous Signs, Nervous Breakdown

	February 24, 1948: Last night, when I was going to the toilet, a weasel suddenly jumped out and ran away when I chased it. In recent days, because the earthen kang was too hot, I didn't get enough sleep, and I felt mentally dazed and suspected something was wrong. When Brother Jiangguang (the battalion's deputy battalion commander, Huang Jiangguang) went to the machine gun company, the lamp shade exploded without fire. These are not good omens. So, I gathered all the company commanders and gave them instructions to strengthen the fortifications. As a result, all the officers and soldiers worked overnight. February 26: Last night, I dreamed that Lian (referring to his wife, Shulian) took Ping (referring to his son) to Shantou to live temporarily, but unfortunately, Shantou fell. June 1: Yesterday, after breakfast, I got angry in the toilet, and my right hand and clothes were soiled, so I had to boil water to take a bath. In the afternoon, I couldn't sleep again. Suddenly, the hanging photo frame fell off naturally and hit the ceramic bowl, covering it on the table. Looking closely, the surface of the ceramic bowl mirror was not damaged. The light went out by itself at night without wind. These three consecutive omens made me suspicious. At first, I thought the locals said the word "shit" (屎) meant wealth, probably referring to the sale of family rations. But then I thought, could selling family rations bring ghosts? At the same time, I also thought of the possibility of an enemy (referring to the People's Liberation Army) attack tonight. Therefore, I couldn't sleep even more at night.

	Escape Wind is Raging, Cries of Helplessness

	February 13, 1948: There are many deserters, comparable to the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War. What to do! What to do! February 14: I sat in my room all day, because the problem of desertion is worrying me to death. The reason for this is the fear of being sent to the Northeast after centralized reorganization and training. This rumor has been circulating for several days, knowing that we will suffer particularly heavy losses. June 2: Several squad leaders have left without saying goodbye (deserted). As a result, it is necessary to re-evaluate our combat effectiveness. 【Jidong Frontline Communication】

    末路
    ——一个蒋军营长的日记
    今年六月十五日，蒋匪原粤军六十二军一五七师四七一团三营被我军歼灭于唐山北任各庄，营长何淳斌被俘。以下是他去年八月底到今年六月间的日记摘录。
  抓骗偷抢  暴行自供
    三十六年九月廿一日：来了一批新兵，都是自家乡（指广东）“抓”来的，我很怕有弟弟在里头，心怦怦然。十二月十日：余因大军之征用，使用诈术，实觉有亏军人本色，（？）然除此，又如何呢？明知欺骗亦只欺骗了也。十二月十三日：下午回抵庄子宿营，军纪之坏，实难言喻。十二月廿九日：日昨余捕得擅取民间猪羊之特务班一士兵。卅七年一月七日：经丰润城，军纪甚坏，如此，只有替共产党宣传作证。一月十六日：晚间得宋德林电话，在东北塘南面有操粤语士兵数名，抢民财二百五十万元。一月二十二日：因有士兵出卖燃料，早饭后亲自赴新河调车场缉拿，捉获二人。二月二十二日：宋部（按指其营中之一连）至傅张庄，该村昨日遭三区自卫队（按指蒋匪伙会）抢劫，人畜均拉一空，房屋半已烧毁，究竟犯什么不是，那只有天知道。一面在剿“匪”，一面又制“”，何时剿得耶？
  胆战心惊  夜不敢睡
    三十七年二月二十五日：昨夜不敢睡，和衣躺至二十二时，始睡衣入睡，至本日一时三十分，被犬声惊醒，急穿衣查哨，犬声由东而南，而西而北，至一时二十分许，又寂然，判定非敌（按指人民解放军）袭，三时许，重解衣入睡。五月二十日：夜来东北角西北角均有沉重爆炸声，预料某据点及交通线又被“害”（破击）矣，战斗庄也遭敌袭击，弄得我一夜没有安睡，这“三等饭”真难吃。五月三十日：夜间远处爆炸声频传，使我不能入睡。五月三十一日：昨夜遭敌袭击，一夜不能入寐，日间仍是睡不着。三十七年一月六日：微风吹，天气觉甚寒，拂晓某庄发现二百余人向我重急行，乃炮击之，盖友军（蒋匪军）也。五月十九日：今晨零时三十分，即行进在尖字沽，将敌数十包围，又被漏网，反自己误会，毙一伤二，这才可惜。
  不祥之兆  神经错乱
    卅七年二月廿四日：昨夜正上厕，忽有一黄鼠狼跃出，追之逃去。数日来因土炕太热，睡眠不足，精神恍惚，心疑有他，剑光兄（该营副营长黄剑光）至机枪连，灯罩无火自炸，朕兆不佳。乃集合各部队长，授以确实加强工事。以是各部官兵连夜工作。二月二十六日：夜梦莲（按指其淑莲）以平（按指其子）赴汕头暂住，而不幸汕头陷落。六月一日：昨日早饭后，在厕所给气得右手及衣服都污了，只好烧水洗澡。午后，又睡不着。忽然又上挂着的相框自然的掉下来，碰在磁碗上，盖覆在桌面，细看磁瓜镜面都未损坏。晚上灯无风自灭。这接连的三个兆意，使我狐疑起来。最初我以为乡里人说的屎字是财，大概应该卖眷粮的事情。然转一想念，难道卖眷粮还会出鬼吗？同时又联想到今夜敌人（按指人民解放军）可能袭击，因之，夜里更是睡不着。
  逃风正炽  徒唤奈何
    三十七年二月十三日：逃兵甚多，与抗战后期可比拟。奈何！奈何！二月十四日：整日闷坐，盖逃兵问题正在忧心如焚，其所以致之者，乃恐集中整训后，开往东北也，此遥言起已数日，知蒙受损失特大。六月二日：不告而别（开小差）的班长有好几位，这么一来，战斗力突有重新估价的必要。【冀东前线通讯】
