Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th. Labor delegates from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, in discussing the reports of Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun, expressed with full confidence their determination to complete the tasks set forth in these two reports. Based on their personal experiences, they described the hunger and terror persecution suffered by workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas under the rule of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, as well as the increasingly developing situation of workers' heroic resistance struggles. They believe that seeing the strength and victorious development of the liberated areas firsthand has greatly encouraged them and will greatly inspire the fighting courage of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

    The Shanghai delegate said: The wages of Shanghai workers today are not enough to pay off yesterday's debts for food. We demand to be fed, but the response is tank charges and machine-gun fire. In the Xin Xin No. 9 Factory wage increase strike alone, more than 100 workers were killed or injured. The traitorous Kuomintang government has sold Shanghai to U.S. imperialism, making it a paradise for them to enslave the Chinese people and workers. Female workers in Shanghai and women of other classes in the Kuomintang-controlled areas generally dare not walk alone on small streets for fear of being insulted by American soldiers. At the entrance of the American military club on Jing'an Temple Road, rickshaw and pedicab pullers are often beaten until their heads are bleeding by American soldiers who refuse to pay fares. Except for coffins, which are not made in America, everything from Shanghai's large department stores to small stalls is American-made. Japanese goods are even more rampant than armed smuggling before the War of Resistance. On Nanjing Road, there were demonstrations of capitalists driving dairy cows because their rice bowls had been overturned by American milk powder. Employees of major department stores launched a large demonstration against the dumping of foreign goods this year on "February 7th"; Liang Renda, an employee of Wing On Company, was beaten to death by secret agents but refused to yield. The working class has used its blood in the anti-Chiang and anti-American struggle to educate many national capitalists, making them see where their own way out lies. They, like the workers, are waiting for: "The Kuomintang is about to end, and the Communist Party is coming soon!" The Shanghai delegate said with great enthusiasm: "The Shanghai workers, with the glorious traditions of the 'May Thirtieth' general strike and three armed uprisings during the Great Revolution of 1927, know how to welcome the Chinese People's Liberation Army. When Japan surrendered, 6,000 workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard organized a picketing team and disarmed the Japanese soldiers who were trying to sabotage the factory. I represent the organized workers of Shanghai in assuring the conference that when Shanghai is liberated, the Shanghai workers will do everything possible to preserve the factories and warehouses intact, the power plants will immediately resume supplying electricity, and the waterworks will immediately resume supplying water. Cars and trams will continue to run on Nanjing Road, which has been sprinkled with the blood of workers. We are confident of turning Shanghai into the most prosperous people's city. We welcome the Seventh Labor Congress to be held in a free and great Shanghai!"

    The Southern delegate said: The reports of Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun not only express the wishes of the workers in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas, but also the wishes of the vast number of overseas workers. During the War of Resistance, 300,000 workers at home and abroad conducted anti-Japanese donations and refused to transport Japanese goods. Under the leadership of the CCP, they organized the Dongjiang Column (now the Liangguang Column), rescued a large number of anti-Japanese figures and Allied airmen, and made brilliant achievements. However, after the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang replaced the Japanese bandits and became the "new Japanese army," bringing more disasters to the people and workers. "Peace for three days, the pot lid facing the sky," this was the conclusion made by the Southern workers about the Kuomintang reactionaries at that time. Now the South has become a market for the dumping of American and Japanese goods, and national industries are collapsing in large numbers. In Guangzhou alone, 40,000 textile workers, 25,000 metalworkers, and 6,000 rubber workers have been unemployed one after another. He said: The Southern people and workers, whose illusions about the Kuomintang have been shattered, have quickly turned to new struggles. On the very day that the Kuomintang government promulgated the bloody Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes, the workers launched a large strike. On June 18th of this year, 297 trade unions from various industries in various places convened a grand mass meeting in a certain place against America and supporting Japan, enthusiastically discussed the CCP's "May 1st" call for convening a new CPPCC, and unanimously advocated resolutely overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule. He said: "The people of the South have three years of experience since the Japanese surrender. Any peace conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries can no longer deceive us. The enemy wants to turn the South into their last base of counter-revolution, but the people and workers of the South are also prepared to make the last 'welcome.' Now, in more than 90 counties in Guangdong, people's armed activities are everywhere. We will definitely work hard to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army's offensive, arrest the reactionary leaders, and publicly try them together with our brothers across the country."

    The Wuhan delegate said: In Wuhan, an important base for munitions production, the Kuomintang reactionary group forced workers to carry out slave labor under its military administration, and established a so-called Jianghan General Labor Union with a group of traitors, secret agents, and scabs to carry out terror control over the workers. Once, the enemy drove cars into the ranks of strikers and opened fire on the spot, killing or injuring 42 workers and arresting more than 200, but these could not stop the workers' struggle at all, but only deepened the hatred of the Wuhan workers. Many workers have joined the people's armed forces on the outskirts of Wuhan, and those who remain in the factory also use various methods to fight the enemy.

　　国民党统治区劳大代表
  　热烈讨论大会报告
    广大工人以必胜信心
  　英勇抗争推翻蒋介石
    【新华社东北十七日电】劳动大会国民党统治区代表，在讨论高岗、陈云同志的报告中，信心百倍地表示他们一定要完成该两报告所提出的任务。他们以亲身体验，叙述国民党统治区的工人遭受美帝国主义和国民党反动统治的饥饿和恐怖迫害以及工人英勇反抗斗争日益发展的情形。他们认为这次亲眼看到解放区力量的强大与胜利的发展，大大鼓舞了他们并将大大鼓舞国民党统治区工人的斗争勇气。上海代表说：上海工人今天的工资，不够还昨日下锅的欠债，我们要求吃饱饭，但得到的回答却是坦克冲撞和机枪扫射。仅仅申新九厂一次增资罢工，工人即被杀伤了一百多人。卖国的国民党政府把上海出卖给美帝国主义成为它奴役中国人民和工人的乐园。上海女工及国民党统治区其他阶层妇女因怕被美兵侮辱，一般不敢一个人在小街上走。静安寺路的美军俱乐部门口，常常有三轮车和人力车工人被不付车钱的美兵打得头破血流。除了棺材不是美国造，上海大商场到小摊贩都是美货，日货比抗战前的武装走私还要猖獗。南京路上出现过资本家赶着奶牛的示威行列，因为他们的饭碗被美国奶粉打翻了。各大百货公司店员，今年“二七”发动过反对外货倾销的大示威，永安公司店员梁仁达被特务打死也不低头。工人阶级以自己反蒋美斗争的鲜血教育了许多民族资本家，使他们看清了他们自己的出路在那里。他们也和工人一样地期待着：“国民党快完了，共产党快来吧！”上海代表激昂的说：“有过‘五卅’大罢工和一九二七年大革命时三次武装起义光荣传统的上海工人，他们知道怎样迎接中国人民解放军。日本投降时，江南造船厂六千工人就曾经组织纠察队，把企图破坏工厂的日军缴械了。我代表上海有组织的工人向大会保证，上海解放的时候，上海工人将尽一切力量把工厂仓库完整的保存下来，发电厂马上恢复送电，自来水厂马上恢复送水，汽车电车照常在曾洒遍工人鲜血的南京路上奔驰，我们有信心把上海变成最兴隆的人民城市。我们欢迎第七次劳动大会在自由的大上海召开！”
    南方代表说：高岗、陈云两同志的报告，不但说出了解放区和国民党统治区工人的愿望，而且也说出了广大海外工人的愿望。在抗战期间海内外三十万工人曾进行抗日献金，拒运日货，在中共领导下组织东江纵队（即今天的两广纵队），援救大批抗日人士及盟国航空员等，建树了光辉的功绩，但日寇投降后，国民党却代替日寇成了“新日军”，给人民和工人带来更多的灾害。“和平三天，沙锅子朝天”，这是南方工人当时给国民党反动集团所做的结论。现在南方已成了美货日货倾销的市场，民族工业大批倒闭，仅广州一地先后即有四万纺织工人、二万五金工人和六千树胶工人失业。他说：对国民党幻想破灭的南方人民和工人迅速地转入了新的斗争。就在国民党政府颁布血腥的紧急治罪法的当天，工人即发动了一次大罢工。今年六月十八日，各地各业的二百九十七个工会即在某地召开了反美扶日的盛大的群众大会，热烈讨论了中共“五一”提出的召开新政协的号召，一致主张坚决推翻国民党反动统治。他说：“南方人民有了日本投降后三年来的经验，国民党反动派的任何和平阴谋再不能欺骗我们了。敌人想把南方变成他们反革命的最后基地，但南方的人民和工人也已准备作最后一次的‘迎接’。现在广东九十多县，到处都有人民武装的活动。我们一定努力配合人民解放军的进攻，把反动派头子抓起来，和全国弟兄们一齐公审他们。”
    武汉代表说：军火生产重地的武汉国民党反动集团强迫工人在其军事管理下进行奴隶劳动，而且以一批汉奸、特务、工贼成立所谓江汉总工会，对工人进行恐怖控制。有一次敌人曾以汽车冲入罢工者的行列，当场扫射，死伤工人四十二名，被捕二百多，但这些丝毫也不能阻止工人的斗争，而只更加深了武汉工人的仇恨。许多工人已参加了武汉外围的人民武装，留在厂里的也用各种方法与敌人进行斗争。
