Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Reports from various sources state that the so-called "Reynaud Plan" (i.e., the "Emergency Powers Act") proposed by the reactionary French Queuille government was slightly modified and passed by the French parliament on the 11th. However, the modified parts were restored by the French Senate on the 14th, and the parliament finally passed it on the 17th. Thus, the French reactionaries have completed the legislation granting the Queuille government broad powers, launching an attack on the working people. French Communist Party members fought resolutely against the passage of the bill throughout the entire discussion process. Pravda, in its commentary on the passage of this plan, pointed out that it gives "the French reactionaries the opportunity to launch a broad offensive against the achievements gained by the French working people after the war." The living standards of the broadest strata of the French people, the working conditions in nationalized industries, factories, and institutions, the status of civil servants, and the social security system are all under threat. At the same time, "l'Humanité," the organ of the French Communist Party, revealed that the notorious Reynaud, immediately after the passage of his plan, was actively preparing to visit the United States to "thoroughly study the problem of Marshallizing France" with his masters. "l'Humanité" revealed that Reynaud's specific task in visiting the United States is to discuss, on the one hand, how to further devalue the franc to better suit the interests of the American masters; and on the other hand, to discuss, under the Marshall Plan, the auctioning of the French automobile industry to the American automobile trust "General Motors Corporation," following the example of the Italian reactionaries.

　　法反动派向劳动人民进攻
  　真理报评“雷诺计划”
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报导：法国反动的马利政府所提出的所谓“雷诺计划”（即“紧急权力法案”），于十一日为法议会略加修改通过后，其修改部分竟于十四日为法参院予以恢复，议会也于十七日予以最后通过。至此，法国反动派已完成了赋予马利政府以广泛权力的立法，向劳动人民进攻。法国共产党议员在整个讨论过程中以顽强的战斗反对该法案的通过。真理报于评论这一计划的通过时指出：它使“法国反动派有了对法国劳动人民在战后所获的成就进行广泛进攻的机会”。法国最广大的各阶层人民大众的生活水准，国有化工业、工厂和机关的劳动条件，公务员的地位，以及社会赡养制度都已受到威胁。同时，法共机关报“人道报”揭露臭名昭著的雷诺在其计划刚一通过后，即在积极准备访美与其主子“最彻底地研讨使法国马歇尔化问题”。人道报揭露，雷诺访美的具体任务，一方面是商讨如何进行法郎进一步的贬值，使其更符合于美国主子的利益；另一方面则是商讨在马歇尔计划下将法国汽车工业按照意大利反动派陈例，拍卖给美国汽车托辣斯“通用汽车公司”。
