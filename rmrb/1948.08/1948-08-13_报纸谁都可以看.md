Inquiries and Answers

　　Everyone Can Read the Newspaper
    Comrade Editor: Some landlords, rich peasants, and literate people who were struggled against in the past, want to look at the newspaper when they see it, and some even specifically seek out newspapers to read. Is it permissible for them to read newspapers now?
    Also, can landlords and rich peasants individually subscribe to newspapers? Please reply.
