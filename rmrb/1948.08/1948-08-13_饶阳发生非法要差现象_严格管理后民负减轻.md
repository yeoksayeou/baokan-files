[Ji Zhong Electricity] In Raoyang's Chengguan, Liuxian, Dayincun and other four transportation stations, due to the lack of strict management and inspection systems in the past, many illegal uses of civilian labor occurred. Some organs and individuals used discarded mobilization certificates and passes instead of mobilization certificates; some transported non-mobilization duty items without going through the station's mobilization procedures, directly mobilizing vehicles from the villages; some did not hold mobilization certificates, but only used their own organs' letters of introduction to ask the station for carts. From April 15th to May 8th, in more than 20 days, 113 large carts were mobilized that should not have been mobilized. The county's armed forces department discovered this serious waste of civilian labor and convened a meeting of cadres from various stations and district cadres to conduct a profound review of the past waste of civilian labor, deciding that all stations should strictly establish and improve various systems in the future. The phenomenon of illegally using civilian labor without mobilization certificates or without formal mobilization procedures should be strictly corrected. In the future, all villages should use duty record certificates (which are taken back by the duty performers to the village as proof of work); the goods that need to be transported by vehicles should be personally inspected by the station cadres, and according to the weight of the goods, the road conditions, and the distance, the number and weight should be checked, and efforts should be made to reduce the use of civilian labor as much as possible. After reorganization and improvement, great achievements have been made. A certain unit used seven double-horse carts to transport 390 bundles of shoe soles (each bundle weighing ten and a half catties), and when they arrived at the Chengguan transportation station, the station inspected them and used five large carts to send them away. Some phenomena such as honorary soldiers visiting relatives asking for large carts, and asking for large carts without mobilization certificates, have been rejected. In 53 days, a total of more than 300 people and animals were saved.

Editor's Note: During the busy farming season, the general practice should be to stop corvée labor. Except for combat missions and the transportation of urgent military supplies, which should be allocated according to proper mobilization procedures and under the principle of cherishing civilian labor and eliminating waste, all other corvée services should be strictly prohibited. Illegal behaviors such as honorary military personnel asking for large carts to visit relatives should be absolutely prohibited.

　　饶阳发生非法要差现象
  　严格管理后民负减轻
    【冀中电】饶阳城关、留现、大尹村等四个交通站，过去由于没有严格建立管理检查等制度，发生了不少非法动用民力的现象。有些机关和个人用作废的动员证及通行证代替动员证；有的运输非动员勤务物品，又不经站的动员手续，直接向村动员车辆；有的不持动员证，只用本机关的介绍信向站要大车。自四月十五日到五月八日的廿多天中，动员了不该动员的大车一百一十三辆。该县武装部发现了这种严重的浪费民力现象，便召开各站干部及区干会议，对过去浪费民力作了深刻的检讨，决定今后各站应严格建立与健全各种制度。无动员证或不经正式动员手续而非法动用民力的现象应严加纠正。今后各村应使用支勤计工证（由出勤者带回交村计工的凭据）；需要动用车辆转运的物品，经过站干亲自检查，根据物品重量，道路好坏远近，实行过数与过秤，尽量作到减少动用民力。经过整理改进后，已有很大成绩。某部用双套车七辆运鞋底三九零捆（每捆十斤半），拉到城关交通站，经该站检查后用了五辆大车送走了。有些荣车串亲戚要大车，及无动员证要大车等现象都被拒绝了。在五十三天中共节省了人畜三百多个。
    编者按：在农忙期间应一般的停止支差。除参战任务、运输紧急军用物品应依照正当的动员手续，在爱惜民力、杜绝浪费的原则下拨差外，其余一切差务均应严格禁止，象荣誉军人串亲戚要大车这种违法行为，更应绝对禁止。
