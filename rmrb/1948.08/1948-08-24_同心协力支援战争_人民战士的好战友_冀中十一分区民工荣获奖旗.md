　　Working Together to Support the War
    "Good Comrades-in-Arms of the People's Soldiers"
  　Jizhong 11th Military Subdistrict Labor Corps Awarded Banner
    [Jizhong Electric] The support-the-front labor corps from Ningjin, Jinxian, Shenxian, Wuqiang and other counties in the Jizhong 11th Military Subdistrict, followed the army from early March to the Chahar-Suiyuan, Yanbei, Ping-Sui, and Ping-Bao lines, traveling thousands of miles for five months. They have now gloriously returned home after completing their tasks. In every battle, the labor corps demonstrated great bravery, overcoming difficulties to complete their missions. In the Chahar-Suiyuan campaign, they overcame the difficulties of traversing unfamiliar mountain roads and participated in the battles of attacking Yangyuan and Tumu, completing their tasks each time. During the Ping-Bao campaign when attacking Dingxing, the Second Platoon of the Second Company of the Ningjin stretcher team closely followed the attacking troops, passing through several enemy fire blockade lines in a row. While the attacking troops were scaling the city walls, the labor corps waited below. Three stretchers from the Fourth Squad rescued fifteen wounded soldiers during the battle. Peng Shuangchun, a member of the Jinxian First Brigade labor corps, followed the soldiers onto the city walls to rescue the wounded. Patients like Liu Xiaodan and cooks like Yin Zhifang also voluntarily went to the front line to rescue the wounded. Jin Donglai, the Second Platoon Leader of the Gaocheng Second Company, carried eleven wounded soldiers off the front line himself, carrying the last one all the way to the field hospital five miles away from the front line. When attacking Xushui, labor corps member Yu Qingtian carried a wounded soldier, bent over, walking more than half a mile in the trenches. Li Chuju, who made contributions in the Chahar-Suiyuan campaign, led ten stretchers through the blockade line to the front to transport the wounded. Under the continuous strafing of three or four enemy planes, they calmly and boldly completed the transportation mission safely. In rescuing the wounded on the front line, Communist Party members and cadres set an example and took the lead. Wang Zaohai, the captain of the Ningjin stretcher team, led the way to the front line, rescuing the wounded in the most dangerous places. Squad leader Wang Jingrui charged forward to rescue the wounded under the fire blockade of three enemy outposts. Party members Liu Xiufa, Wang Luoti, and others all took the lead in completing their tasks. The labor corps' care for the wounded was meticulous. During enemy aircraft circling, one stretcher team of the Jinxian First Brigade constantly comforted the wounded, stroking their heads and stomachs to alleviate their pain. When it rained, Xue Bahai of the Ningjin labor corps took off his clothes to cover the wounded, carrying the stretcher bare-chested. Liu Jihong's shoes were broken, and he carried the stretcher barefoot for forty miles. Many members of the labor corps took care of the wounded's bodily needs and used their own money to buy them food. They paid attention to lifting and placing the stretchers gently, greatly moving the wounded soldiers. Before the glorious return of the labor corps, the troops held a grand farewell ceremony, praising their heroic deeds. The headquarters and political department of a certain column presented a banner of "Good Comrades-in-Arms of the People's Soldiers" and awarded prizes and certificates to the heroes.

    【冀中电】冀中十一分区宁晋、晋县、深县、武强等县支前民工，从三月初随军远征察南、雁北、平绥、平保沿线，辗转数千里，历时五个月，现已完成任务光荣回乡。在历次战役中，民工们都表现非常英勇，克服困难完成任务。察南战役中，他们克服了走不贯山道的困难，参加了攻打阳原、土木等战斗，每次都完成了任务。平保战役攻打定兴时，宁晋担架队二连二排，紧跟着攻城部队，一连穿过敌人数道火力封锁线，攻城部队爬城时，民工们就在城下等候，四班三付担架在战斗中抢下十五个伤员。晋县一大队民工彭双春，跟着战士们一块上城抢救伤员。病号刘小旦，伙夫尹志芳等，也自动上火线抢救伤员。藁城二连二排长靳东来一个人从火线上背下了十一个伤员，最后那一个他一气背到离火线五里远的野战医院。攻打徐水时，民工郁庆田背着伤员弯着腰，在战壕里走了半里多地。在察南战役中立了功的李触居，自己带动了十付担架，通过封锁线到前方转运伤员，在敌人三四架飞机连续扫射下，他们沉着大胆，安全的完成转运任务。在火线上抢救伤员中，共产党员、干部以身作则起带头作用。宁晋担架队大队长王造海领头上火线，到最危险的地方抢救伤员。班长王景瑞在敌人三个岗楼的火力封锁下，仍冲上去抢救伤员，党员刘秀发、王洛体等，都带头完成了任务。民工们对伤员的爱护，更是无微不至。晋县一大队一付担架，在敌机盘旋时，不断的安慰伤员，并给伤员摸头揣肚子，减轻伤员的痛苦。下雨时，宁晋民工薛八孩把衣服脱下来给伤员盖上，自己光着膀子抬。刘纪红的鞋破了，光着脚抬了四十里。很多民工都给伤员接屎接尿，拿自己的钱给伤员买东西吃。在抬担架中都注意轻抬轻放，使伤员们大为感动。在民工们光荣回乡前，部队举行了盛大的欢送会，对民工的英勇事迹，倍加赞扬。某纵队司令部、政治部送给“人民战士的好战友”的大旗一面，并给功臣们发了奖品、奖状。
