To suppress the rapidly developing Japanese workers' movement, particularly fearing the anticipated August strike offensive by the Japanese working class, MacArthur sent a letter to the Ashida government on July 22nd, suggesting amendments to the Civil Service Law to prohibit strikes by public service employees, and expressing "resolute support for any effort to obstruct the labor offensive." The Japanese government, acting on MacArthur's instructions, issued a reactionary order on the 31st, prohibiting employees of national government agencies, local public agencies, and public enterprises from their legal rights of collective bargaining, strikes, and slowdowns. They also attempted to formally pass this anti-labor law during the September parliamentary session. Ashida himself, on the eve of issuing the order, grimly threatened to deal with strikers using "the strictest means of punishment." However, Japanese workers are now, with heroic spirit, defying the heavy threats of the US occupying forces and their puppet Ashida government, launching a struggle to resist the reactionary offensive. On July 30th, the Japanese Communist Party called on the working class in *Akahata* to rise up and "defend democracy" and demanded "the resignation of the fascist Ashida cabinet and the dissolution of the parliament." The National Postal Workers' Union, with 370,000 members, disregarding the threats of the Ministry of Communications, announced a general strike on the 7th. In addition, union leaders announced that 500,000 workers would hold a demonstration in downtown Tokyo on the 15th; leaders of the Federation of Industrial Labor Unions predicted that 2.4 million government employees would go on strike. Tsuruoka, the secretary-general of the Liaison Committee of Government and Municipal Workers' Unions, even more bravely sent a letter of protest to MacArthur Headquarters on July 31st, questioning whether he had "abolished the fundamental principles of democracy"?

Other more important events in recent times include: (1) The just struggle of the Malayan people against the British, due to the British authorities further adopting violent suppression policies, has erupted into an armed resistance movement, which has won the sympathy of progressive forces in various countries. (2) The Soviet Union's published semi-annual production summary announced that the total industrial output for the first half of the year exceeded the plan by 5%; the main grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union (such as Ukraine) are experiencing a bumper harvest exceeding last year's output; the industrial production of Eastern European countries also exceeded the plan in the first half of the year. (3) The South Communist Party Congress, under the control of the South Communist Party's top clique using barbaric and terroristic methods, has concluded. The Tito-Ranković group still adheres to their erroneous policies and has "embarked on the road of fascist methods" (*Pravda*). (4) The "hodgepodge" French Marie cabinet has been formed. Judging from its composition and platform, the Marie cabinet is more reactionary and also more fragile than the Schuman cabinet. (5) The Danube River Conference opened in Belgrade on July 30th.

    日本工人抗击反动攻势
    各业工会宣布即将罢工
    麦克阿瑟为镇压迅速发展壮大的日本工人运动，特别是害怕预期中的日本工人阶级的八月罢工攻势，乃于七月二十二日致函芦田政府，示意修改公务员法以禁止公共事业的职工罢工，并表示“坚决支持阻挡劳工攻势的任何努力”。日本政府奉行了麦克阿瑟的指示，于三十一日下了一道反动命令，禁止全国政府机关、地方公共机关以及公共企业的职工之集体议价、罢工与怠工这些合法权利。并且企图在九月间的议会上正式通过这种反劳工法令。芦田本人并且在下令前夕狰狞地恫吓说：要以“最严格的惩罚手段”对付罢工者。然而日本工人现在正以蔑视美占领军及其走狗芦田政府重重威胁的英雄气概，掀起抗击反动攻势的斗争。日本共产党于七月三十日在赤旗报上号召工人阶级起来“保卫民主”，并要求“法西斯的芦田内阁辞职和解散议会”。拥有三十七万会员的国营递信工人工会不顾递信省的威胁，宣布于七日举行总罢工。此外，工会领袖们宣布：五十万工人将于十五日在东京市中心区举行示威；产业劳动组合联合会领袖则预告：二百四十万政府机关职工将进行罢工。政府及市政机关职工工会联络委员会总书记鹤冈则更英勇地于七月三十一日向麦克阿瑟总部提出抗议书，质问他是否“取消了民主的基本原则”？
    最近时期中之其他较重要事件尚有：（一）马来亚人民反英的正义斗争，由于英国当局进一步采取暴力的镇压政策，已爆发成为武装的反抗运动，这一运动已经赢得了各国进步势力的同情。（二）苏联发表的半年生产总结，宣布上半年的全部工业总产量已超过计划百分之五；苏联主要产粮地带（如乌克兰）正进行超过去年产额的大丰收；东欧各国上半年的工业生产同样超过了计划。（三）在南共最高集团使用野蛮与恐怖手段控制之下的南共代表大会已经闭幕，铁托、兰科维奇集团仍坚持着他们的错误政策，并已“走上了法西斯方法的道路”（真理报）。（四）“七拼八凑”的法国马利内阁已经组成，从它的成份和政纲看来，马利内阁较舒曼内阁更加反动同时也更加脆弱。（五）多瑙河会议已于七月三十日在贝尔格莱德开幕。
