　　Yuchi New District Supplements Autumn Vegetable Planting
    [Jinzhong News] The Yan bandit's "soldier-farmer integration" tyranny and insane looting and extortion have caused severe famine in the Yuchi area. In Dapu Village, Yuchi County, more than 1,000 mu of land were left uncultivated out of a total of 4,400 mu. In the "no-man's land" area around Beitian Village on the Zhengtai Railway, almost all of the village's land was barren, covered with weeds, and even the roads were no longer visible. In order to overcome the famine threat to the 70,000 people in the Yuchi New District, the Yuchi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has urgently called on the masses to seize the season and plant autumn vegetables on a large scale to prevent famine and save themselves. The Yuchi Democratic Government has already distributed 1,050 jin of grape, turnip, and mustard seeds, worth 45 million yuan, to poor farmers free of charge, and has sent cadres to the countryside to mobilize and organize rush planting.

　　榆次新区补播秋菜
    【晋中讯】阎匪“兵农合一”的暴政和疯狂的抢劫勒索，在榆次一带造成严重的灾荒。该县大堡村，共有四千四百亩地，就荒了一千多亩。正太路北田村一带的“无人区”，全村土地几完全荒芜，满地荒蒿，连道路都看不出来了。中共榆次县委为克服榆次新区七万人民的灾荒威胁，特紧急号召群众抓紧季节，大量播种秋菜，防荒自救。榆次民主政府已将价值四千五百万元的葡萄、蔓菁、芥菜等种籽一千零五十斤，无代价的发给贫苦农民，并派干部下乡，动员组织抢种。（冰如、春旬）
