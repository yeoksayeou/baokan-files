【Taiyue Electric】 Siyuan Village in Qinyuan County is seizing the agricultural season and promptly organizing plowing. Currently, all 700 mu of wheat fields in the village have been plowed for the first time. After the rectification of the mutual aid organizations in Siyuan Village, everyone's morale is very high (see People's Daily, August 7th). At the end of July, when discussing preparations for planting wheat, people said, "If the wheat fields are not plowed during the dog days, the harvest will be affected." Each of the eighteen groups selected a plowing expert, and the 32 animals in the village were voluntarily paired into sixteen teams. Sixteen people were specifically responsible for plowing with oxen, and the remaining two were alternates, so that if someone couldn't plow due to some reason, they could step in and avoid delays. The groups began plowing on the 20th. Wang Shuinian and Wen San's teams plowed both well and quickly. They said, "To plow well, you must first achieve three 'goods': feed the cattle well, take care of the equipment well, and let the animals rest well. When plowing, rest when you should, so the animals won't have problems, and they'll have more energy when they start working again." The leadership promptly introduced these experiences for everyone to learn. It was originally estimated that it would take ten days to finish plowing, but the entire 710 mu of wheat fields were plowed in nine days. This saved sixteen animal labor days compared to the original estimate. After plowing was completed, the leadership immediately proposed settling the work accounts and clearing the wages.

　　四园村抓紧农事季节
  　组织“行家”犁麦地
    【太岳电】沁源四园村小型互助组，抓紧农事季节，及时组织犁地，现全村七百亩麦地已全部犁过头遍。四园村互助组织整顿后，大家情绪很高（见八月七日人民日报）。七月底讨论准备种麦时，人们都说：“麦地伏天犁不过，收成就要受影响”。十八个小组各选出一个犁地行家，把全村三十二个牲口自愿碰成十六犋。有十六个人专门使牛犁地，其余两人候补，有人因事不能去犁地时，他们便顶上去，免得耽误。二十日各组即开始犁。王水年和温三两犋犁的又好又快，他们说：“要犁好地先要作到三好：把牛喂好，家具收拾好，还要叫牲口歇好。在犁地时该歇就歇，牲口不出毛病，再干起来也有劲。”领导上及时介绍了这些经验，让大家学习。原计十天才能犁完，但到九天就把全村七百一十亩麦地犁完了。比原来计算省了十六天畜工。犁完以后，领导上马上提出结算工帐，清理工资。
