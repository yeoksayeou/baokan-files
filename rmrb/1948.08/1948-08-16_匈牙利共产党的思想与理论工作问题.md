　　On the Ideological and Theoretical Work of the Hungarian Communist Party
　　Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party
　　The policies of the Communist Party are guided by theory. This theory was meticulously crafted by Marx and further developed and applied by Lenin and Stalin during the era of imperialism, proletarian revolution, and socialist construction. Comrade Stalin said: This theory requires the Party, at a given moment, to be able to find the special link in the chain of events, and once it seizes this link, it can grasp the entire chain, preparing the conditions for strategic victory. Comrade Stalin also said: The key lies in being able to judge which of the various tasks facing the Party is urgent, and solving this task is the central issue, guaranteeing the victorious realization of all other tasks.

　　Looking back at the work of the Hungarian Communist Party after liberation based on the above, it shows that in each specific period, we were able to find the appropriate link in the chain. The main issue in the period immediately after liberation was to ensure the consolidation of democratic forces. The next link in establishing Hungarian democracy was land reform, followed by economic recovery. The 1945 election showed that the reactionaries not only seriously threatened our democratic foundations politically but also economically through currency devaluation. Under such circumstances, our Party believed it necessary to end inflation and stabilize the currency, treating this as a crucial link. To quote Lenin, it was necessary to hold onto it by all means to maintain the entire chain and thoroughly prepare for the transition to the next link. The success of currency stabilization strengthened the economic foundation of our democracy and helped defeat the reactionaries entrenched in the Smallholders Party. This was closely followed by nationalization measures and the Three-Year Plan. Due to the economic and political achievements of Hungary in its democratic development, conditions were provided for the merger of the two workers' parties and the consolidation of the National Democratic Front. This is the task facing us today.

　　The next link in the chain is undoubtedly to raise the ideological and theoretical level of our Party. Lenin's lesson—only a party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the task of the vanguard—is as correct today as it was then. In the past three years, the Party has been busy with daily work, and it has only been able to give very little attention to theoretical training. We have not yet put on the agenda the development of Marxist theory according to the Lenin-Stalin method, and we have not yet thoroughly studied the main issues related to the growth of Hungarian democracy. Lenin once said that if a communist does not want to fall behind, he must constantly enrich Marxist theory.

　　It must be admitted that we have not given the necessary attention to delving into Marxist theory. We are threatened by a danger. Regarding this danger, Comrade Stalin once said: If, for various reasons, the Party's propaganda begins to suffer, if the Marxist education of the Party's cadres begins to suffer losses, if the work of raising the political and ideological level of these cadres becomes weak, and as a result, the cadres no longer feel interested in the prospects of the Party's forward movement, no longer understand the justice of the Party's cause, and become people without a future... that is to say: all government and Party work will begin to suffer losses. It is necessary to regard the following words as an immutable theorem: in any government and Party work department, the higher the political level and the Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the better the work itself, the more successful it is, and the more effective the results of the work. Conversely, the lower the political level and the Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the greater the chance of work interruptions and failures...

　　To avoid interruptions and failures in our work, we have put the task of raising the theoretical level of our Party on the agenda. We pay more attention to political education than all other parties. 120,000 party members have graduated from various levels of Party schools and training classes. But this is absolutely not enough; in particular, the vast majority of students only attended three-week training classes, or even shorter training classes. The number of 120,000 shows that five-sixths of our party members have not received any systematic theoretical training. The magnitude of the task facing the Party in education can be seen from the fact that more than 90 percent of party members joined the Party after liberation.

　　There are other circumstances that threaten to lower the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level of our Party. The exposure of the right-wing elements of the Social Democratic Party has made our Social Democratic comrades realize that the existence of opposing working-class parties is completely unnecessary, and that this kind of party opposition is not only harmful to the interests of the working class but also harmful to the entire Hungarian democracy. The spontaneous movement to establish a unified workers' party in the working class is rising higher and higher, and tens of thousands of Social Democratic comrades have expressed their desire to join our Party. At present, we have stopped recruiting new party members, but tens of thousands of people are impatiently waiting for the day when recruitment will be resumed.

　　The issue of the merger of the two parties has already been decided at the recent Social Democratic Party congress. However, as emphasized by the leading comrades of the Social Democratic Party, the ideological basis of the merger must be Marxism-Leninism. In this way, within a few months, the former Social Democratic members of the unified party will prove to be correct in demanding to learn the Marxism developed by Lenin and Stalin. But this is only one aspect of the task facing us. In addition to the Social Democratic comrades, peasants and intellectuals have also joined our Party. For example, in Zemplin province alone, 5,000 small farmers, teachers, and doctors joined the organization in the month before the suspension of development. These farmers joined the Party not because they understood the theory of Marxism-Leninism, but because, after three years of observation and experience, they believed that our Party is the most consistent and loyal party, and the party that most successfully represents and defends the interests of the Hungarian working people. These representatives of peasants and intellectuals will not only bring sympathy to our Party but also bring all kinds of prejudices and erroneous concepts. Unless measures are taken to provide the thousands upon thousands of new people who will join our Party in the future with a minimum of theoretical and ideological education, then the currently not-so-high theoretical level of our Party may be further lowered.

　　If this is the case, our Party will not be able to handle some of the problems that the Hungarian people hope to solve. And precisely because as the leading democratic party, we must expand rather than limit our work, we must put the issue of raising the theoretical level of the Party on the agenda.

　　When the Party's Political Bureau discussed this issue, it concluded that we have many shortcomings in the leadership of theoretical work. The Political Bureau itself has not been able to give a Marxist-Leninist explanation of some of the main issues related to the development of Hungarian democracy and the new democracy until today. As a result, incorrect views on the essence of people's democracy are still prevalent within the Party and even within the Political Bureau itself, views that doubt the proposition that people's democracy is an important stage in building socialism. Some people doubt the qualitative changes brought about by nationalization and state control in our economic institutions. The Political Bureau has said that if theoretical work is ignored again, the Party will be in danger. A party that cannot delve into theoretical issues will make serious political mistakes. Therefore, the Political Bureau decided to establish a permanent committee to conduct a Marxist-Leninist study of our democratic issues to lead theoretical work and expose all harmful "theories." This committee includes the best theorists of our Party.

　　As we know, after the end of the war, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik) paid serious attention to theoretical and ideological work, and resolutely eliminated shortcomings in this field. On many occasions, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party criticized in detail the shortcomings in Soviet literature, philosophy, drama, film, and music, and marked the path of cultural development in socialist society. In some new democratic countries, the same work has already begun. For us, the Hungarian Communist Party, the time has also come to start raising our theoretical level.

　　We must make daily newspapers carry out this work. In the Soviet Union, the newspapers and broadcasts are characterized by publishing decisions of the Central Committee and the government on ideological issues. We must stipulate that the weekly edition of "Szabad Nép" must deal with urgent ideological issues. Experience has shown that everyone is quite interested in theoretical issues, and that our efforts to meet this requirement are necessary for the future development of our Party.

　　Our theoretical magazine "Társadalmi Szemle" should publish theoretical articles in the future. It must first criticize works that claim to be Marxist but often contain serious theoretical errors.

　　In order to adapt to the new tasks of the Party's education, we are reorganizing and expanding our Party schools, reviewing the curriculum, and studying teaching materials. Many of the teaching materials we have been using have become obsolete and no longer conform to the development of the Hungarian democratic state; they are often prepared by individuals and contain serious errors. It is also necessary to develop new methods of self-study because the old methods are no longer satisfactory.

　　In view of this, we must transform the publication of theoretical literature. Certain Marxist works either have no translation or are out of print, which hinders the work of raising the theoretical level of our party members. Party members who only understand Hungarian do not yet know most of the works of Lenin and Stalin.

　　Now the main task of our Party is to master the theory of Marxism-Leninism and to raise our theoretical level. The success and prestige won by our Party are primarily due to the fact that the Party is guided and inspired by the theory of Marxism-Leninism. If we cannot raise the theoretical level of the Party, we will limit the development of the Party to stagnation, which will lead to major errors. It is of great importance to us that our Party will also stand at the forefront of the people in the future as a vanguard, and the Party will serve the cause of ensuring our country's prosperity and development on a larger scale. That is why we must study and develop Marxist-Leninist theory—our Party's reliable compass. Today, this theoretical work represents the main Leninist link that we must grasp with all our strength.

　　匈牙利共产党的思想与理论工作问题
    匈共总书记  拉科西
    共产党的政策是受理论所指导的。这个理论为马克思所精心制成，并且在帝国主义、无产阶级革命与建设社会主义时期为列宁和斯大林所进一步发展与运用。斯大林同志说：这一理论要求党在一定的时候，应当能找到进程锁链中的特殊环节，一旦抓着这个环节，就可能掌握整个的锁链，准备达成战略胜利的条件。斯大林同志又说：关键在于能够判断面对着党的各种任务中那一件是迫切的，而解决这一任务是中心问题，并保证胜利地实现一切其他的任务。
    根据以上所述来回顾匈牙利共产党在解放后的工作，表明在每一特定时期中，我们能够找到锁链上的相当环节。刚刚解放后的一个时期的主要问题，是保证民主力量的巩固。建立匈牙利民主的下一环节是土地改革，继之而来的是经济恢复。一九四五年的选举表明，反动派不仅在政治上严重地威胁我们的民主基础，而且还以货币贬值在经济上威胁它。在这种环节下，我们的党认为需要结束通货膨胀、稳定货币，把这当做重要的一环。引证列宁的话来说就是必须用一切办法握紧它，以保持整个的锁链并彻底准备过渡到下一环节。稳定币制的成功，加强了我们民主的经济基础，帮助击败了盘踞在小农党中的反动派。紧跟着的是国有化的措施和三年计划。由于匈牙利在民主发展中的经济与政治成就，提供了两工人政党合并与巩固全国民主阵线的条件。这是今天面对着我们的任务。
    锁链底次一环节，毫无问题地是提高我们党的思想与理论水平。列宁的教训——只有为先进理论所指导的党，才能执行前卫战士的任务——在今天其正确性一如当时。在过去三年中，党曾忙于日常工作，它只能对理论训练给以极少的注意。我们还没有把根据列宁——斯大林的方法来发展马克思主义理论提到议事日程上来，还没有对有关匈牙利民主之生长的主要问题加以彻底的研究。列宁曾经说，共产党人如果不想落后的话，他必须经常地丰富马克思主义的理论。
    必须承认，我们在钻研马克思主义的理论方面没有给予必要的注意。我们为一种危险所威胁。关于这种危险，斯大林同志曾经说：如果因为种种原因党的宣传开始发生缺陷，如果党的干部的马克思主义的教育开始蒙受损失，如果提高这些干部的政治与思想水平的工作变为软弱无力，并且因此干部对党的前进运动的远景不再感到兴趣，不再懂得党的事业的正义性，而变成没有前途的人……那就是说：一切政府与党的工作将开始蒙受损失。必须把下面的话看做不变的定理：在任何政府与党的工作部门，工作人员的政治水平和马列主义的觉悟愈高，工作本身就愈好，也愈有成绩，而工作的结果也愈有效率。反之，工作人员的政治水平和马列主义的觉悟愈低，则工作中断与失败的机会就愈大……。
    为避免我们工作的中断与失败，我们已经把提高我们党的理论水平这一任务提到议事日程上来。我们比所有其他的政党都更注意政治教育。已经有十二万党员从各级党校和训练班毕业了。但是这是绝对不够的；特别是绝大多数的学生只进了三个星期的训练班，或时间更短的训练班。十二万这个数字说明：我们六分之五的党员还未受过任何一种有系统的理论训练。在教育方面摆在党面前的任务之重大可从下面的事实看出来，即百分之九十以上的党员是在解放后参加党的。
    还有其他的情况威胁着降低我们党的马列主义理论水平。对社会民主党右派分子的揭露，使得我们的社会民主党同志们了解到，对立的工人阶级政常之存在是完全不必要的，而这种党派的对立，不仅对工人阶级的利益有害，而且对整个的匈牙利民主都是有害的。在工人阶级中成立统一的工人政党的自发运动愈益高涨，成千成万的社会民主党的同志们表示了他们参加我党的愿望。目前我们已经停止了吸收新党员，但是成千成万的人正在不耐烦地等待着重新恢复吸收的日子。
    两党合并的问题已经在最近社会民主党的代表大会上决定了。然而，正如社会民主党领导同志们所强调的，合并的思想基础必须是马列主义。这样，在几个月的时间内，统一政党中的前社会民主党员，在要求学得为列宁斯大林所发展了的马克思主义上将证明是不错的。但是这只是面对着我们的任务的一方面，除去社会民主党的同志外，还有农民和知识分子参加了我们的党。譬如仅仅在扎姆普林一省，就有五千名小农、教员和医生在停止发展的前一个月参加了组织。这些农民参加党并不是因为他们认识了马列主义的理论，而是因为经过三年的观察与体验，相信我们的党是最始终如一而忠诚的党，是最成功地代表与保卫匈牙利劳动人民利益的党。这些农民和知识分子的代表，将不仅带来对我党的同情，而且也带来各式各样的偏见和错误的概念。除非采取措置，给今后参加我党的成千成万的新人，以最低限度的理论与思想教育，那末，目前本不太高的我党理论水平，可能更加降低。
    如果真是这样的话，我们的党将不能处理匈牙利人民所希望解决的一些问题。而且恰恰因为作为领导的民主政党，我们必须开展而不是限制我们的工作，我们就必须把提高党的理论水平这一问题提到议事日程上来。
    党的政治局讨论这一问题时，得出的结论是：我们在理论工作的领导中有许多缺点，政治局本身直到今天，对有关匈牙利民主之发展和新民主主义的一些主要问题，也来能给予一个马列主义的解释。其结果是，关于人民民主的本质问题，在党内甚至在政治局本身还流行着不正确的观点，怀疑在建设社会主义中人民民主是一个重要的阶段这一命题的观点。有些人怀疑国有化与国家管制在我国经济机构中所造成的质变。政治局曾经说过，再忽视理论工作，党就会有危险。一个不能钻研理论问题的党就会犯严重的政治错误。因此，政治局决定设立一个常设委员会，以便对我们的民主问题作一番马列主义的研究，来领导理论工作和暴露一切有害的“理论”。这个委员会包括了我党最好的理论家。
    如我们所知道的，在战争结束以后，苏联共产党（布尔什维克）对理论、思想工作给予了严重的注意，坚决地消灭这一领域中的缺点。在许多场合中，联共中央委员会对苏联文学、哲学、戏剧、电影、音乐中的缺点提出了详尽的批评，标出了社会主义社会中文化发展的道路。在一些新民主主义国家中，同样的工作也已经开始。对我们匈牙利共产党来说，着手提高我们的理论水平的时候也已到来了。
    我们必须使每天的报纸进行这一工作。在苏联，报纸与广播的特点是刊载中央委员会和政府关于思想问题的决定。我们必须规定“萨巴德·涅普”报的星期版一定要处理迫切的思想问题。经验表明，大家对理论问题是有相当兴趣的，而我们尽量满足这一要求对于我党的将来发展是必要的。
    我们的理论杂志“塔沙达米·赛姆杰”在将来应刊载理论文章。它必须首先批评那些自称为马克思主义的、却常常含有严重的理论错误的作品。
    为了适应党的教育方面的新任务，我们正在改组与扩大我们的党校，审查课程，和研究教材。我们一向使用的教材许多已经陈旧，不再符合于匈牙利民主国家的发展；它常是由个人准备的，而且包含着严重的错误。也需要制订自修的新方法，因为旧方法已不能令人满意。
    有鉴于此，我们必须改造理论文献的出版工作。某些马克思主义著作或者没有译本或者业已绝版，这阻碍了提高我们党员理论水平的工作。只懂得匈牙利文字的党员们，还不知道列宁和斯大林大部分的作品。
    现在我们党的主要任务，是精通马列主义的理论，与提高我们的理论水平。我们党所赢得的成功与威信，首先是由于党是为马列主义的理论所指导与鼓舞的。如果我们不能提高党的理论水平，我们将使党的发展限于停滞，而这将导向重大的错误。对我们关系重大的是，我们的党在未来也将以先锋队的身份走在人民的前面，党将以更大的规模为保证我国繁荣与发展的事业而服务。这就是我们为什么必须研究并发展马列主义理论——我们党的可靠的指南针——的原因。今天这一理论工作，代表着我们必须用全力紧握的主要的列宁环节。（程之平译自一九四八年四月十五日出版之“争取持久和平与人民民主”杂志）　【新华社电】
