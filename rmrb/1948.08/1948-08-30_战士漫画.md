　　Warrior Comics
    In the political work of a certain unit of the Jin-Sui Liberation Army, using drawings made by the soldiers themselves to educate the soldiers has been adopted as a new educational method. The soldiers love the drawings they make themselves. The content has two aspects: on the one hand, it criticizes the undesirable thoughts and actions of the company; on the other hand, it commends various exemplary behaviors. Because it is flexible and casual, sometimes it is a single picture, sometimes inserted in the middle of the blackboard newspaper, or drawings mixed with articles, it can be published regardless of whether it is garrisoned, marching, or after battle; and regardless of whether one is literate or illiterate, one can draw and read. After it is posted, the soldiers watch and discuss, which provides an example for education and learning for everyone.
    For example, after the Baoji Campaign, many liberated soldiers and some veteran soldiers were nostalgic for city life. At this time, a painting appeared: it depicted a black mountain, with one layer of people climbing vigorously on top, and one person walking listlessly at the bottom. The people on the top of the mountain shouted, "Strive for the iron army, keep it up!", while the person at the bottom cried out, "Oh, I'm so tired I'm going to die!", with images of Baoji's tall buildings, electric lights, foreign noodles, wine pots, and fancy dishes in his mind. When the soldiers saw these paintings, they discussed who had such thoughts. This inspired everyone to enthusiastically examine themselves in the thought review meetings.
    For example, the Tenth Company of a certain unit pulled two donkeys when inspecting an iron factory in Caijiapo. Such materials are not allowed to be taken casually. After the matter was known to the higher authorities, they severely criticized it and returned them on the spot. The branch took this issue as an example of discipline education. The company first drew such a picture: a soldier with very long hands, casually pulling a mule. When the soldiers saw this picture, they knew it was about the incident in their own company. Then the instructor convened a soldiers' meeting, made a self-criticism, and the soldiers also began to criticize themselves.
    Because the soldiers liked these paintings so much, they would put them in their pockets after reading them. Therefore, every time the comics were circulated during the march, the political department often had to send a special correspondent to follow the painting.
    Judging from the effect, warrior comics, like "gun barrel poetry," have great potential for development in the army. (Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 25th)

### 战士漫画

　　战士漫画
    在晋绥解放军某部的政治工作中，用战士自己画的画来教育战士，已被作为一种新的教育方式。战士很爱自己画的画。它的内容有两方面：一方面是批评连队的不良思想和行动；另一方面则表扬各种模范行为。因为它灵活、随便，有时是单幅，有时插在黑板报中间，或者画与文章掺在一起，不管是驻军、行军和战斗之后都能出版；也不管是识字不识字，都能够画，能够看。贴出之后，战士一方面看，一方面就讨论，这样也就给了大家教育和学习的榜样。
    如宝鸡战役后，许多被解放的战士和有些老战士，留恋城市生活。这时出现了一幅画：画的是个黑山，山上面一层人，爬得很有力，山下面一个人，无精打彩走不动的样子。从山上面的人的嘴里喊出：“争取铁的队伍，加油”，下面这个人嘴里叫出：“唉哟，疲劳的要死”，脑子里涌现出宝鸡的高楼、电灯、洋面、酒壶、大菜等。这些画，战士一看就讨论：谁有这种思想。因此启发了大家在查思想会中热烈检讨。
    又如某部十连在蔡家坡检查铁工厂时，拉了两个驴子。这种物资是不许随便乱拿的，这事被上级知道以后，就严加批评当场送还。支部即以此问题做为纪律教育的例子。连里首先就画了这样一幅画：一个军人手很长，随便乱拉着骡子。战士们一看这画，就知道是画的自己连里那件事，接着指导员就召集军人大会，做了自我检讨，战士们也跟着检讨起来。
    因为战士太喜欢这种画，看罢就装进口袋，因此每次在行军中将漫画传阅时，政治部常常要专门派一个通讯员跟着这幅画走。
    从效果看来，战士漫画与“枪杆诗”一样在部队中有大大发展之必要。（新华社晋绥二十五日电）
