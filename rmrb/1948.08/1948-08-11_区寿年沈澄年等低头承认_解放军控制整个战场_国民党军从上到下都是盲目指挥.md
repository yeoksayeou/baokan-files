Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 9th: Kuomintang army officers at the rank of colonel and above, including Qu Shounian, Shen Chengnian, etc., who laid down their weapons in the Kaifeng and Suiqi campaigns, held a forum in the battlefield on the 15th of last month before going to the rear of the liberated area for study. At the meeting, they unanimously recognized that their annihilation was an inevitable fate. Corps Commander Qu Shounian said: "The war is controlled by you (referring to the People's Liberation Army, same below). We cannot take the initiative and are divided by you, resulting in an inevitable defeat." Li Banghua, Brigade Commander of the 6th Brigade of the 75th Reorganized Division, believed that this was the result of the entire Kuomintang army's strategic passivity. He said: "Reinforcing wherever is tight, a passive situation of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches, was already created last year." He also said: "Repeated failures in the war have also caused changes in the psychology of our commanders at all levels." Shen Chengnian, Commander of the 75th Reorganized Division, said: "The Kuomintang army is very pessimistic about the future." They unanimously complained about the incompetence and confusion of their superiors' command. Shen said: "The command is blind from the Ministry of National Defense all the way down." You Lingyun, Chief of Staff of the 66th Reorganized Division, further complained: "The above blindly orders, telling us to defend even when we cannot defend. The reinforcements say they will arrive on such and such day at such and such time, but they actually cannot arrive. This is simply deception." They praised the bravery and skill of the People's Liberation Army. Shen Tianxiang, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 6th Brigade of the 75th Reorganized Division, said: "In battle, the People's Liberation Army can gain a foothold by breaking through one corner and can concentrate firepower to continue advancing." Lu Xingshan, Commander of the 10th Artillery Regiment, said: "During the Kaifeng campaign, under the bombardment of the People's Liberation Army's artillery, our artillery lost its effectiveness. Our twenty cannons are no match for your four." Then he said with emotion: "Many of your artillerymen were trained by us. Among the artillerymen in Kaifeng, I believe some were trained by my own hands. The artillerymen I trained turned around and attacked me, hitting me so hard that I couldn't even lift my head. This is because they understood who they were fighting for." As for their impressions of the liberated areas, Shen Chengnian said: "It is extremely rare that the countryside in the liberated areas is so stable under such severe war circumstances." Shen Tianxiang said: "Your troops are like fish, and the people are like water. I saw that your stretcher teams were not escorted by guns, which is something we cannot do." Therefore, their understanding of the war's prospects is that the Kuomintang will inevitably be defeated. As Qu Shounian said: "You have actually controlled the entire battlefield, and you also have the advantage politically. I think the Communist Party's victory is only a matter of time."

　　区寿年沈澄年等低头承认
  　解放军控制整个战场
    国民党军从上到下都是盲目指挥
    【新华社中原前线九日电】开封、睢＠两役放下武器之国民党军上校级以上军官区寿年等，在赴解放区后方学习前，于上月十五日曾在战地举行座谈。会上，他们一致认识他们的被歼是必然的命运。兵团司令区寿年说：“战争给你们（指解放军，下同）控制了，我们不能主动，又受到你们的分割，造成了必然的败局。”整七十五师六旅旅长李邦华认为这是整个国民党军战略被动的结果。他说：“哪里吃紧增援哪里，头痛医头脚痛医脚的被动局势，去年就造成了。”他又说：“战争屡次失败，在我们各级指挥官的心理上也起了变化。”整七十五师师长沈澄年则说：“国民党军中对前途都非常悲观。”他们一致埋怨其上级指挥的无能与混乱。沈说：“从国防部一直到下面都是盲目指挥。”整六十六师参谋长游凌云更埋怨：“上面盲目命令，不能守也叫守。增援部队说哪天哪时到实际上不能到，这简直是欺骗。”他们对解放军的英勇善战交口称赞。整七十五师六旅副旅长沈天翔说：“解放军在战斗中突破一隅就能站住脚，并且还能集中火力继续前进。”炮十团团长陆兴善说：“开封战役中在解放军炮兵轰击下，我们炮兵就失去了作用。我们二十门炮也抵不上你们四门。”接着他感慨地说：“你们的炮手不少是我们训练出来的，你们也开封的炮手中我相信有经过我亲手训练的。自己训练的炮手反来打自己，打得我头也抬不起来。这就是他们懂得了为谁打仗的原因促成的。”至于对解放区的感想，沈澄年说：“解放区在战争相当严重的局面下，农村还这样安定，这是异常难得的事。”沈天翔说：“你们部队象鱼，人民象水。我看到你们的担架队并没有枪来押送，这一点我们是办不到的。”因之，他们对战争前途的认识都是国民党必败。如区寿年说：“你们实际上已控制了整个会场，在政治上你们也占了优势，我看共产党胜利只是时间问题。”
