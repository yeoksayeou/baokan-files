    "Mobile Warfare" is Passive Defense
    "Hollow Tactics" are Truly Hollow
    Captured Chiang Army Officers from Dingxing and Xushui Discuss Fu Zuoyi's Incompetent Command

    [Pingbao Frontline Telegraph] Frontline reporter Zhu Han reports: "The annihilation of the Provisional 31st Division is the inevitable result of Fu Zuoyi's incompetent command." This is the unanimous opinion expressed to reporters by the commander and deputy commander, along with all regimental-level officers and above, of the Chiang bandit New 2nd Army's Provisional 31st Division, captured in the battles of Dingxing and Xushui. Shortly after the battle ended, Major General Chen Zhiping, commander of the division, spoke about the division's annihilation, pointing to the bullet hole in his left leg and the two bullet holes in his shirt, saying, "It's a stroke of luck I wasn't killed in this battle. The annihilation of my division (referring to the Provisional 31st Division) was destined by Fu Zuoyi's clumsy command. Fu Zuoyi's forces are insufficient, yet he overestimates himself, playing so-called 'mobile warfare' and 'hollow tactics,' concentrating only a few main force corps to cope with the powerful offensive of the North China People's Liberation Army. He placed the Provisional 31st Division, a division with weak combat power, and two guarding regiments, along the important Pingbao railway line from Fengtai to Jingtangpu, a distance of nearly 300 li, scattering them to maintain Pingbao traffic. My division was under the direct command of headquarters (referring to Fu bandit headquarters), and all defense deployments had to be executed according to headquarters orders, leaving my division with no room for maneuver. Fu Zuoyi did not expect that the PLA's Jidong offensive had just ended, and the offensive on the Pingbao line would unfold so quickly. After the battle of Dingxing began, headquarters telegraphed my division, saying, 'Aircraft are providing day and night assistance, and large corps transported by automobile are on the way; you must hold firm and await reinforcements.' But until my entire division was annihilated, the reinforcements were still blocked in Zhuozhou, and then my division was ordered to move north. It can be seen that Fu Zuoyi was taking care of one thing and losing sight of another, and his so-called 'mobile warfare' was actually passive defense." Major General Lu Jiyun, deputy commander of the division, sarcastically described Fu bandit's "hollow tactics," saying, "Fu Zuoyi's 'hollow tactics' are truly hollow! In the face of the PLA's powerful offensive, Fu Zuoyi's 'hollow' meant that the isolated points of Dingxing and Xushui on the Pingbao line, guarded by my division, were like a few small mounds in a great flood, how could they not be submerged?" Colonel Xie Yunqing, commander of the division's 2nd Regiment, directly pointed out that "Fu Zuoyi's command decisions were uncertain and frequently wavered." He said, "On the morning of the 6th, Fu Zuoyi headquarters telegraphed my regiment to abandon Laishui, and at 9 PM that evening, telegraphed again to leave a battalion to assist the county government in controlling Laishui, while the main force of the regiment strengthened the defenses of Beiyi'an. My regiment arrived at Beiyi'an again at 2 AM on the 7th. Headquarters again telegraphed at 6 AM to withdraw to Dingxing. Before we had even settled down in Dingxing, headquarters telegraphed again on the 8th to return to Beiyi'an to 'control Laishui.' By the 14th, they hastily ordered my regiment to withdraw to Dingxing city. Fu Zuoyi commanded my regiment in such a panic, shuffling back and forth between Laishui, Beiyi'an, and Dingxing, and in the end, he sent us into the PLA's mouth." Colonel Zhao Jichuan, director of the division headquarters' political work office, said, "The morale of my division was unexpectedly low in this battle. When your army (referring to the PLA) attacked Nanguan, Guo Quechi, the platoon leader of the 6th Company of my division's 1st Regiment, ordered him to arrange a machine gunner to block your army, but the machine gunner refused to fire and was shot dead by Guo Quechi. The entire platoon immediately shot Guo Quechi and laid down their weapons. After your army broke through the South Gate, the division commander ordered the special service company and the sergeant team to counterattack, but the special service company and the sergeant team were all timid and unwilling to advance."
    [Pingbao Frontline, 29th] Major General Chen Zhiping, Major General Lu Jiyun, Colonel Zhao Jichuan, Colonel Pang Yu, Colonel Xie Yunqing and Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Pingsan, regimental commander of the 8th Railway Guard Regiment of the Chiang bandit New 2nd Army Provisional 31st Division, who were captured by the People's Liberation Army in the Baobei campaign, were sent from the front to the rear for study on the 24th. Before leaving, they unanimously stated: "PLA officers and soldiers are very kind to us, which is very unexpected. The panic and fear before and after surrendering have disappeared."

    “机动作战”是被动挨打
    “空心战术”真是空着心
    定兴徐水被俘蒋军官谈傅作义指挥无能
    【平保前线电】前线记者朱汉报导：“暂三十一师的被歼是傅作义指挥无能的必然结果。”这是我军解放定兴、徐水等战斗中，俘获的蒋匪新二军暂三十一师正副师长，和全体团级以上军官，对记者发表的一致意见。战斗结束后不久，该师少将师长陈志平谈到该师被歼的经过时，他指着已被子弹贯穿了的左腿，和衬衣衣襟上的两个弹孔说：“这次战斗未被打死，真是侥幸，我师（指匪暂三十一师）的被歼，是傅作义拙劣的指挥所注定了的。傅作义兵力不足，不自量力，玩弄所谓‘以主力对主力’的‘机动战略’和‘空心战术’的把戏，集中仅有的几个主力兵团，应付华北解放军的强大攻势，把暂三十一师这样一个战斗力薄弱的师和两个守护团，摆在平保线丰台至荆堂铺将近三百里的重要铁路线上，分散守备，来保持平保交通，我师受总部（指傅匪总部）直接指挥，一切防御部置，完全要执行总部命令，我师毫无机动余地。傅作义没有想到解放军冀东攻势刚告一段落，对平保线的攻势就如此迅速展开。定兴战斗打起来后，总部电告我师说：‘飞机昼夜助战，汽车运送之大兵团正在途中，务坚守待援。’可是直到我师全部被歼，援兵仍被阻于涿县，旋又命我师北调。可见傅作义顾此失彼，所谓‘机动作战’实则是被动挨打。”该师少将副师长卢继云，用讽刺的口吻形容傅匪的“空心战术”说：“傅作义的‘空心战术’真是空着心！在解放军的强大攻势面前，傅作义‘空心’之后我师把守的平保线定兴、徐水这些孤点正好比大水中的几个小土堆，那能不被淹没？”该师第二团上校团长解云清，直捷了当的指出“傅作义的指挥决心是毫无把握，经常动摇的。”他说：“傅作义总部六日晨电令我团放弃涞水，下午九时又电令留一个营协助县府控制涞水，团的主力加强北义安防务。我团于七日上午二时再抵北义安。总部又于六时电令撤回定兴，撤到定兴还未住下来，总部又于八日电令返回北义安，以‘控制涞水’。到十四日，又慌忙军令我团撤回定兴城。傅作义这样慌慌张张的指挥着我团在涞水北义安和定兴之间转来转去，结果还是送到解放军嘴里。”该师师部政工室上校主任赵济川说：“我师士气，此次战斗中真正意想不到的低落，贵军（指解放军）攻入南关时，我师第一团六连排长郭确池，命令他安排一个机枪射手阻击贵军，那个射手拒绝开枪，被郭确池击毙。这一排士兵当场枪毙了郭确池，全排放下了武器。贵军攻破南门后，师长命令特务连和军士队反冲锋，特务连和军士队都畏缩不前。”
    【平保前线廿九日电】此次保北战役中为人民解放军俘虏之蒋匪新二军暂编三十一师少将师长陈志平、少将副师长卢继云、师政工室上校主任赵济川、第一团上校团长庞禹、第二团上校团长解云清及铁路守护第八团中校团长张聘三等，已于二十四日从前方送至后方学习。临行前一致表示：“解放军官兵对我们都很和蔼，这一切很出预料之外，缴枪前后的恐慌疑惧已经没有了。”
