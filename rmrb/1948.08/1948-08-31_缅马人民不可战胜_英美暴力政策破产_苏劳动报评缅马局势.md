　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: TASS, Moscow, August 22nd: The Labor News recently published an article commenting on the situation in Burma and Malaya, stating: British and American monopoly capitalists are colluding to suppress the national liberation movements in Burma and Malaya. Their plans for police and military measures against the peoples of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, and Burma have been drafted in the Anglo-American Chiefs of Staff joint meetings in Washington. Their spreading of the so-called "Communist conspiracy" in Southeast Asia is merely a smokescreen to conceal their conspiracies against the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of the colonies. The development of the situation in Burma and Malaya reflects the bankruptcy of their policies of violence and deception against the colonial people, because there is no force in the world that can stop these people from being masters of their own destiny.

  　苏劳动报评缅马局势
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：劳动报顷著文评论缅甸及马来亚的局势称：英美独占资本家正在狼狈为奸的镇压缅甸及马来亚的民族解放运动。它们对印尼、越南、马来亚及缅甸人民所采取的警察的及军事措施的计划，已在华盛顿英美参谋长联席会议中拟定。它们在东南亚地区散布所谓“共产党阴谋”，只是一种烟幕，借以掩饰它们反对殖民地自由、独立及主权的阴谋。缅甸及马来亚局势的发展，反映出它们对殖民地人民所施行的暴力政策和欺骗政策的破产，因为世界上没有一种力量能够阻挡这些人民为其自己命运的主人。
