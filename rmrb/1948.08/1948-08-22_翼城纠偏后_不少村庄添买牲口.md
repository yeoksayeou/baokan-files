　　【Taiyue Telegraph】After the rectification in Yicheng, middle and poor peasants are busy tidying up their homes and buying more livestock for production. The middle peasants of Beiding Village in the Fifth District said: "Growing crops depends entirely on livestock. We didn't dare to buy them in the past, but now we can rest assured!" The whole village quickly bought livestock. Thirty head of livestock were purchased in total. Thirty-two head were purchased in Wufan Village. Thirteen administrative villages in the whole district bought a total of two hundred and sixty-one head of livestock. Three villages in the first district bought more than thirty head of livestock. Three villages in the fourth district bought nineteen head of livestock.
    【Jinan Telegraph】Yongnian's Second District suffered severe devastation from the enemy and puppet regime, and the number of livestock in various villages was greatly reduced, with some villages losing one-half or even two-thirds of their livestock. Li Village, with two hundred households, decreased from more than one hundred head to thirty head. This caused great difficulties in restoring and developing agricultural production. At the same time, due to the masses' ideological concerns about raising livestock, those who could afford to buy livestock did not. Based on this situation, the Yongnian County Government, on the one hand, lent 130,000 catties of wheat to the masses in the Second District, and on the other hand, promoted that individuals could freely buy and sell livestock, and guaranteed livestock ownership, and that villages could not arbitrarily assign or borrow livestock. The ideological concerns of the masses were gradually dispelled, and the difficulties were resolved. Villages began to purchase livestock one after another. Thirteen villages in the North Xiao District have now purchased sixty-one head; thirteen villages in the Middle Xiao District have purchased seventy-two head. According to statistics from twelve villages, more than twenty households who did not borrow grain have also bought livestock.

　　翼城纠偏后
  　不少村庄添买牲口
    【太岳电】冀城纠偏后，中贫农忙着整顿家务，添买牲口闹生产。五区北丁村中农们说：“种庄稼全凭牲口哩，过去不敢买，现在可放心啦！”全村很快头牲口，贷了三十，五范村买了三十二头买区十三个行政村共区两一百六十一头。一，四个村添买三十余头头。区三个村买了十九。
    【冀南电】永年二遭受敌伪严重摧残，各村牲口大量减少，有的村减少二分之一甚至三分之二。二百户的李庄村，即由一百多头减至三十头。给予恢复与发展农业生产上以很大困难。同时由于群众对养牲口存有不少思想顾虑，能买的也不买。永年县府根据这情况一方面贷给二区群众麦子十三万斤，一方面宣传各人牲口可以自由买卖；保证牲口所有权，村中不能乱派乱借等。群众的思想顾虑逐渐打破，困难得到解决，各村开始纷纷购买牲畜。北小区十三个村，现已买了六十一头；中小区十三个村已买到七十二头。据十二个村统计，没贷粮的也有二十多户买了牲口。
