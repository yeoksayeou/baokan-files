　　Hengshui Grain Bureau Poorly Stores Public Grain
 　　Suggests Investigation of Responsibility by the Southern Hebei Administrative Office

Editor:

　　These past few days of rain have made everyone very concerned about the large amount of public grain stored at the Hengshui Grain Bureau in the Southern Hebei District. After the rain, we went to the train station and in front of the Grain Bureau's warehouse to check if the public grain loaded onto the trains had been damaged. Sure enough, some had sprouted roots, and some had germinated (of course, not all of it). It is said that it was not covered during one rainy day, and only covered on the second day. If it had been covered well when the rain started, this would not have happened. These ten, thirty-ton train cars were fully loaded with public grain (millet), totaling three hundred tons, or six hundred thousand market pounds. It truly makes us feel regretful and heartbroken.

　　This millet is the result of the masses' hard labor and sweat. They delivered it to Hengshui with so much effort, and it should be handled with responsibility and extreme care. This time, it was not stored well. The people coming and going all discussed it and felt heartbroken about the wasted grain. We specifically suggest that the Southern Hebei Administrative Office should investigate the responsibility of the Hengshui Grain Bureau and publish the investigation results in the People's Daily to educate the entire district.

　　衡水粮食局保管公粮不好
  　建议冀中行署检查责任编辑同志：
    几天阴雨，大家对冀中区住衡水粮食局装上很多的公粮非常关心。雨后赴车站及粮食局仓库门前，去装在火车上的公粮是否受了损失。果然有的生根，有的发芽（当然不是全部生芽）。据说是下一天雨未盖，第二天才盖的。头下雨如能盖好即不致如此。这十辆三十吨的车皮满装公粮（谷子），共合三百吨重，合六十万市斤，真叫我们可惜、心痛。
    这些谷子群众费了多少劳力，流了多少汗才打下来，又费了多少劳力运到衡水，应当向人民负责，万分谨慎保管才对。这次没保管好，来往群众见了，莫不议论纷纷，心痛这些粮食。特建议冀中行署对住衡水粮食局应检查责任，并将检查处理结果在人民日报上公布教育全区。
