Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd. Before the counter-attack campaign in the Huanglong Mountain area, all units of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, with unparalleled determination and high confidence, launched an enthusiastic mobilization to eliminate the bandit Hu's 36th Division. Commanders and fighters wrote letters to Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, volunteering for battle. The entire party membership of the 5th Company of a certain unit wrote in a letter of guarantee to the团 (regiment) Party Committee: "Through the Four Reviews study, we have enhanced our Party spirit. We dare to guarantee to the Party that we will play a leading role in the most critical situations of combat and complete any arduous task." The Second Battalion and the combat heroes of the First Battalion proposed five comparisons: First, compare bravery and tenacity; second, compare developing wisdom to reduce casualties; third, compare unity and mutual assistance in leading troops well; fourth, compare the ability to overcome any difficulties; and fifth, compare doing a good job in earthwork, sweating more to bleed less. Many cadres and soldiers swore to avenge the martyrs in front of the memorial tablets of the fallen heroes. The Second Squad of the Sixth Company of the Eighth Company publicly declared: "Our commando team has been organized automatically. If the squad leader and deputy squad leader are wounded, anyone can lead the entire squad to continue fighting." Under this surging combat sentiment, preparations for combat operations were launched enthusiastically. The Second Company of a certain unit launched a bayonet-sharpening movement. The soldiers affixed slips of paper with slogans such as "Kill the enemy," "Pierce the deer stockade," and "Remove obstacles" to their sharpened bayonets. When meeting each other, the first sentence was "Make a contribution!" Heavy machine gunner Ma Guangcai, touching his brightly polished machine gun, said with a smile: "This time, eliminating the 36th Division depends entirely on you to make contributions!" The soldiers everywhere were singing: "Hand grenade, good partner, the enemy is finished when they see you; heroes are on the merit book, half for you, half for me."

　　黄龙山区反击战役前
  　西北健儿热烈请战
    【新华社西北二十三日电】黄龙山区反击战役前，西北人民解放军各部皆以无比决心和高度信念，掀起消灭胡匪三十六师的热烈动员。指战员纷纷写信给彭德怀副总司令请战。某部五连全体党员给团党委的请战保证书写道：“我们经四评学习，提高了党性。我们敢向党保证，在战斗最紧急的情况下，都能起带头作用，完成任何艰巨的任务。”二大队与一大队战斗英雄提出了五比：一比英勇和顽强；二比发扬智慧减少伤亡；三比团结互助带兵好；四比任何困难不能挡；五比土工作业作得好，流汗多来流血少。不少干部和战士在追悼先烈灵前宣誓杀敌复仇。八中队六连二班当众宣称：“我们的突击队已自动地组织好了。如正副班长挂了花。无论谁都能带领全班继续战斗”。在这高涨万丈的战斗情绪下，热烈地展开了战斗行动的准备。某部二连展开磨刺刀运动，战士们都在磨得雪亮的刺刀上贴上“杀敌人”、“挑鹿砦”、“除障碍”等纸条。互相见面时，第一句话就是“立个功吧！”重机枪手马光才摸着他擦得明晃晃的机枪笑着说：“这次消灭三十六师，全靠你立功啊！”战士们到处都唱着：“手榴弹，好伙伴，敌人见你就完蛋；英雄上了功劳簿，你一半来我一半”。
