Industrious Research

　　[Jizhong Electricity] Xinji City has new creations in industrial production. Wang Pin-yi, a technician at the Wanju Leather Factory in the city, seeing that leather-making raw materials (such as *zi*, *kezi*) were both expensive and scarce, often researched using local raw materials to replace foreign ones. Later, he found a local medicine called *Huang* that tasted as bitter as *zi* and *kezi* and also had astringent properties. He boiled this local medicine in a pot until it was mushy and soaked a piece of leather in it for testing. After two days of soaking, the leather bubbled up, but it was not very thick and the color was not right. Later, he continued to experiment and transform the process. First, he cut the *Huang* into small sections and boiled it in a pot until it resembled thin porridge, then poured it into a vat, mixed it with water, and stirred it evenly. Then, he put the leather in to soak for seven or eight days. After taking it out, he soaked it in lambskin water for one or two days to make it mature leather. The color was even better than using *zi*. After this transformation, it used to cost 70,000 yuan in foreign currency to mature one cowhide, but now it only costs 16,000 yuan, saving 54,000 yuan compared to the past. It used to take thirteen days to soak, but now it only takes seven or eight days, saving a lot of firewood. This creation makes a considerable contribution to the leather-making industry in the city. According to the city's average monthly maturing of 788 cowhides, it saves more than 40 million yuan per month, greatly reducing costs.
    Cheng Guodong, a worker at the Yufeng Paper Factory in the city, after many days of research and experimentation, successfully manufactured the "Forward" brand toothpaste. The method is to use magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, wheat starch, dry oil, soap powder, syrup, peppermint oil, banana oil, and potassium chloride as raw materials, and melt tin and lead with fire, then roll them into appropriately sized paper to serve as toothpaste tubes. Now, five workers can produce one hundred tubes of toothpaste a day. The quality is almost the same as the "Guben" toothpaste, and the price is very cheap.

　　技工王品一创用＠黄熟皮
    【冀中电】辛集市在工业生产上，又有新创造。该市万聚皮厂技术工人王品一，见到制皮原料（如＠子，苛子）又贵又缺，便常常研究用土产原料代替外来的。后来他找到叫＠黄的土药，味和＠子，苛子一样苦，也有涩巴性。他就把这种土药放在锅里熬烂，泡上一块皮子试验，泡了两天皮子泛起来，但不大厚实，色也不正气。后又不断试验改造，先把＠黄切成小节放在锅里熬的象稀粥，再放到缸里掺上水搅匀，然后放上皮子泡七八天，涝出来再用羔子水泡一两天就成了熟皮。成色比用＠子还好。经过这样改造后，从前熟一张牛皮需洋七万元，现在只用一万六千，比过去省五万四千元。以前要泡十三天，现在只七八天即可，节省好多柴禾。这个创造对该市制皮工业贡献不小。按全市一月平均熟七百八十八张牛皮计，一月就省下四千余万。使成本大大降低。
    该市裕丰纸厂工人程国栋，经多日研究试验，制造的前进牌牙膏也已成功，方法是用炭酸镁、炭酸钙、小麦淀粉、干油、皂粉、糖浆、薄荷油、香蕉油、盐酸钾作原料，把锡、铅用火化后，轧成适皮纸当牙膏袋。现在五个工人一天能出牙膏一百袋，质量和固本牙膏差不多，价钱又很便宜。
