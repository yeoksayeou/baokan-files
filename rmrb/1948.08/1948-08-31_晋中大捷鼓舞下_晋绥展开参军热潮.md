Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 26th. Inspired by the victory of the People's Liberation Army in Jinzhong, the emancipated peasants in various parts of the Jin-Sui liberated area enthusiastically responded to the call to join the army, and they volunteered to sign up in groups to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs. Li Yongkui, a district cadre in Lin County, said in his request: "My family used to be so poor that we had no food or clothing. Now I have been allocated 53 mu of land and become a new middle peasant. I am now also a cadre. I am determined to join the army and go to the front line to fight." Xue Xiuying, a women's cadre in Miaode Village, District 9, said in a letter mobilizing her fiancé to join the army: "We are both Communist Party members, and we must be role models in everything." Under the leading influence of cadres and party members, the masses launched a wave of joining the army. At the celebration meeting for the Jinzhong victory in Chegan, Gaojiashan and other five villages in District 7 of Lin County, 108 people signed up on the spot to join the army, vowing, "We will not return until we have smashed Yan's alms bowl (a term the masses use for the bandit Yan)!" According to preliminary statistics from nine counties including Lin, Guo, Dai, and Li (Shi), more than × thousand people have flooded into the People's Liberation Army. The new recruits who joined the army this time have all passed the democratic review by the masses and are of extremely high quality. The masses in various places are now enthusiastically comforting the new recruits, and are sending them to the camp in groups with folk drums and music. The Political Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region specifically instructed the political departments at all levels to strengthen the work of educating the new recruits, pointing out that it is a huge transformation process from being an emancipated peasant to becoming a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, after the new recruits are concentrated, ideological education should be carried out in conjunction with solving practical problems. The main focus is on conducting current affairs education and speaking bitterness education, and using their personal oppression and pain to stimulate their class consciousness, hatred of the enemy, and confidence in victory, and to establish a clear concept of war. The instruction also stated: In the process of education, attention should be paid to developing and cultivating activists, party members, district cadres, peasant association members, labor heroes, etc. among the new recruits, and boldly using them to make them the backbone of uniting and consolidating the new recruits.
