　　[Jizhong Electric] To solve the production and living difficulties of disaster victims, the Jizhong Administrative Office has decided to issue 1.5 million jin of grain loans in the disaster-stricken areas. Another 350,000 jin of relief grain will be issued. These have now been distributed to the various disaster-stricken counties. To strengthen leadership over production and disaster relief work, the Administrative Office has organized two production and disaster relief work teams to go to disaster areas such as Wuji and Xian County to inspect production and disaster relief and flood control work.
　　[Jizhong Electric] In order to continue to reinforce the breaches and prepare for wheat planting, and to organize disaster victims for production and self-salvation, the Jizhong Administrative Office issued instructions calling on all localities to continue reinforcing breaches that can be blocked in a planned way. For dangerous sections of embankments, adequate preparation and inspection should be carried out. If the river rises again, mobilize the entire village to defend and protect, striving to prevent further breaches. If all efforts have been made and rescue is still impossible, all cadres must do everything possible to rescue every person, every room, every item, and every mu of crops in the disaster area to reduce the losses of the masses. Disaster victims must be relieved. First, mobilize the masses to help each other. If the disaster is too severe, production is difficult, and there is no one to rely on, the local government should quickly provide relief. When providing relief, a good investigation must first be conducted, and relief should be provided according to the severity of the disaster in each household, and it should not be distributed equally. The 350,000 jin of relief grain allocated by the Administrative Office should be specifically distributed to the counties by the special districts. Local shops and promotion agencies should go deep into the disaster areas to provide disaster victims with mats and coal to solve their housing and firewood difficulties. Villages that have been surrounded by water for a long time should be helped to repair and purchase boats. Use the method of organizing the masses for production to provide relief. In particular, it is necessary to call on and organize the masses to plant more wheat. At present, it is necessary to first understand the difficulties that the masses have in planting wheat (such as lack of fertilizer, lack of seeds, lack of animal power, etc.) and come up with solutions. Promotion agencies should organize the masses to carry out sideline production according to the season and local production habits and conditions. Disaster areas without promotion agencies should set up branches to lead disaster victims in production and carry out cooperative and mutually beneficial production and self-salvation movements. Organize all strata (regardless of poor, middle, rich peasants, or landlords), and all those with labor power should participate in production teams or production cooperatives. However, the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be adhered to during organization. The government and promotion agencies should actively help and transform existing cooperatives and production teams. Absorb experienced veteran farmers with experience in production and overcoming famine to participate in leading production and disaster relief work. Provide appropriate assistance to poor and struggling village cadres to enable them to wholeheartedly lead production and disaster relief. Finally, call on cadres and the masses to unite and actively carry out flood control and production and disaster relief work. Those who make achievements should be rewarded, and those who are passive and lazy should be criticized and punished in a timely manner.

　　冀中行署贷粮款发指示
  　组织灾民生产自救
    【冀中电】冀中行署为解决灾民生产和生活困难，决定在受灾区发放贷粮一百五十万斤。另发赈粮三十五万斤。现已分配到各个受灾县份。为加强生产救灾工作的领导，行署组织了两个生产救灾工作组，分赴无极、献县等灾区检查生产救灾和防汛工作。
    【冀中电】冀中行署为继续抢堵决口，准备种麦，组织灾民生产自救，发出指示号召各地对能堵上的决口，要有计划的继续抢堵。对险工堤段，要有充分准备和检查，如河水再涨，就动员全村力量防守抢护，争取不再决口。如尽到一切力量还护救不住，全体干部对受灾区的一个人，一间房，一件东西，一亩庄稼都要尽一切力量抢救，减少群众的损失。对灾民要救济。首先发动群众互救互济，如受灾过重，生产困难，又没依靠的户，当地政府应赶快赈济。赈济时要先调查好，按各户受灾轻重，分别救济，不能平均分配。行署拨的三十五万斤赈济粮，专区要具体分配到县。各地商店和推进社，要深入到灾区，供给灾民席、煤，解决他们住房烧柴的困难。长期被水包围的村，要帮助他们修理和购买船只。用组织群众生产的办法来救济。特别要号召组织群众多种麦，眼下要先了解群众种麦有什么困难（如缺肥料、缺种籽、缺畜力等），想出解决的办法。推进社要根据季节及当地生产习惯和条件，组织群众开展副业生产。没推进社的灾区要设立分社，领导灾民生产，开展合作互助的生产自救运动。组织各阶层（不分贫、中、富农、地主），凡有劳力的人都参加生产组或生产合作组。但组织时必须掌握自愿两利的原则。政府、推进社对旧有合作社和生产组，要积极帮助和改造。吸收生产渡荒有经验的老农，参加生产救灾领导工作。对贫苦困难的村干部要适当的帮助，使他们全心全力去领导生产救灾。最后号召干部和群众齐心团结，积极进行防汛和生产救灾工作，作出成绩的要给以奖励，对消极怠工的要及时批评和处分。
