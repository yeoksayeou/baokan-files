　　Joint Notice from the Border Government and Logistics Command:
  　Organize River Crossings to Facilitate Transportation
    [From Our Newspaper] In order to organize river crossings and facilitate transportation and postal services, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, and the Logistics Command of the North China Military Region have jointly issued the following notice: Since late July, continuous rain has caused a surge in the water levels of rivers in North China, disrupting transportation. In some cases, rivers lack ferries, and the water is deep and swift, making it impossible for vehicles transporting military supplies and pedestrians to cross. The delivery and mailing of official documents, letters, and newspapers for military and government agencies and post offices have also been suspended, significantly impacting work. To address this issue, it is hoped that all county governments will promptly instruct local governments to organize the masses to establish river crossing teams at river crossing points within their jurisdiction that are important transportation routes but lack ferries. These teams will assist military supply vehicles, pedestrians, and the transportation of official documents, letters, and newspapers to facilitate transportation.

    River crossing teams can be used as a substitute for war service or can charge fees to appropriately address the difficulties faced by people crossing the river. The amount of the fees will be determined by the local government, and staff members can be reimbursed by their agencies upon presentation of receipts.

　　边府暨后勤司令部联合通知
  　组织渡河便利交通
    【本报讯】为组织渡河便利交通运输邮递，晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀边区行政委员会暨华北军区后勤司令部顷特发出联合通知如下：七月下旬以来，阴雨连绵，华北境内各河水势暴涨，交通受阻，更加有的河流无渡船，河水既深且急，运输军需物资之车辆及行人无法渡过，军政机关邮局之公文信件报纸等之传递邮寄，亦告停顿，影响工作颇大。为解决此一问题，希各署县于所属境内各河流渡口处，系来往孔道而无渡船者，迅即责成当地政府组织群众成立渡河队，帮助军需车辆来往行人渡河，及运送公文信件邮件报纸等，以利交通。
    渡河队可抵顶战勤或采取收费办法，以适当解决过河群众的困难。收费多少，由当地政府酌定，工作人员持凭据向机关报销。
