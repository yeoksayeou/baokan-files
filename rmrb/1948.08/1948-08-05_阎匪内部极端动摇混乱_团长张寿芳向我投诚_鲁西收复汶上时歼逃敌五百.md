    [North Yue News] Under the duress of our Jinzhong army's continuous victories, extreme shake-up and confusion prevail within the Yan faction. Zhang Shoufang, regiment commander of the Second Regiment of the Eighth Column of the Yan faction stationed in Yuci (note that Yuci was not liberated at that time) and Yuanwo, defected to our side on the evening of July 8th with a pistol. He received proper escort along the way and has now safely arrived at our rear agency. (Sun Guoqing)
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd] When the People's Liberation Army recovered Wenshang County in Western Shandong on the 14th of last month, it annihilated a portion of the fleeing First Brigade of the bogus Shandong Provincial Security Forces, capturing over 500 enemies, including the regiment commander, deputy regiment commander, and others.
