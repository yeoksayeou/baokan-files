　　Striving for National Independence, Democracy, and Freedom
  　The Heroic Struggles of the Eastern People
    Recently, the people's revolutionary movements in various parts of the East striving for national independence, democracy, and freedom have seen many new developments. Such as the expansion of the people's armed struggle in Burma; new developments in the people's self-defense struggle in the Philippines; and the Indonesian people preparing to meet a new Dutch invasion.

    The Burmese people's struggle against British imperialism and its running dog Thakin Nu government has long developed into an armed struggle. This struggle has recently become more tense due to the constant mutinies of the volunteer army within the Thakin Nu government. According to Agence France-Presse, it is estimated that at least 4,000 volunteers and military police have mutinied, some of whom have joined the Burmese Communist Party-led forces. At present, the war has unfolded in southern and central Burma, especially around Rangoon. The Thakin Nu government has hastily declared a state of emergency throughout the country, and the government forces are under the direct command of a British general. Even so, the strength of the government forces is "weak," as even the British Manchester Guardian cannot help but admit. In 1945, the Burmese Communist Party, together with Aung San, Thakin Nu, and others, jointly formed the "Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League" to strive for Burmese independence. The number of league members once reached 200,000. In August 1946, under the appeasement and division policies of British imperialism, the bourgeois group represented by Aung San betrayed the Burmese national revolution and compromised with Britain. In January of this year, they established the so-called "independent government" and declared the Burmese Communist Party illegal, arresting Burmese Communist Party members en masse, forcing the Burmese Communist Party to independently shoulder the heavy responsibility of reorganizing the national people and persisting in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, and taking up arms to fight. Due to the persistent struggle of the Burmese Communist Party, the internal contradictions of the Thakin Nu government have increasingly grown. Dissatisfaction among its volunteer army and socialist party members with the authorities' policy of surrendering to Britain and opposing communism has increased. Although the Thakin Nu government issued a so-called "left-wing unity plan" in May of this year, attempting to deceive the volunteer army and the socialist party into canceling their organizations, it was opposed by the volunteer army. When deception failed, it turned to suppression. Thakin Nu began to arrest some volunteer army members, which finally led to the recent mutiny of the volunteer army.

    The Philippine people's armed struggle against US imperialism and the Quirino government has seen new developments. Since July of this year, under the direction of US imperialism, the Quirino government has instigated a peace conspiracy, using a so-called "amnesty" to lure the People's Anti-Japanese Army into laying down their arms, and repeatedly extending its "amnesty period." However, this conspiracy did not succeed. When the "amnesty period" ended on August 15, Quirino, finding himself still trapped in ridiculous fantasy, became furious and ordered the "enforcement of law and order" against the People's Anti-Japanese Army. Since then, the Philippine army and police have provoked the People's Anti-Japanese Army, thereby arousing the People's Anti-Japanese Army's resistance and attacks. Even Reuters admits that these attacks have posed an "increasingly serious threat" to the Quirino government.

    Due to the insistence of US and Dutch imperialism on its policy of reducing the Republic of Indonesia to a colony, political and military negotiations in Batavia have successively come to a standstill. The "no war, no peace" situation that has existed between Indonesia and the Netherlands since January of this year is on the verge of collapse, and Dutch imperialism is preparing to launch an offensive. Originally, the so-called "peace talks" were merely a smokescreen for US and Dutch imperialism to prepare for a new offensive against Indonesia. However, the Hatta group and its followers had fantasized about seeking a compromise favorable to themselves through "peace talks." The seven months of peace talks have proven how greedy the US and Dutch colonial rulers are, and the compromise policy of the Hatta government, the executor of the Renville Agreement, has proven to be a suicidal policy of handing the knife to the Dutch rulers. The Indonesian people have become increasingly dissatisfied with the Hatta government. The congress of thirty-two trade unions, representing millions of Indonesian workers, recently demanded the resignation of the Hatta cabinet, the establishment of a new government by the National Front, the abolition of the Renville Agreement, and the cessation of negotiations with the Netherlands.

    The Viet Minh forces launched attacks in Cochinchina and other places starting on the 20th to respond to the colonial policies of the French Marie government and its running dog Nguyen Van Xuan. The armed struggle of the Malayan people against the oppression of British imperialism is still being heroically sustained. Although more and more British troops are preparing to be投入into the war in Malaya, the British military authorities have openly expressed a lack of confidence, sadly lamenting that the war will last for several years. The British Communist Party has issued a call to British workers, urging them to refuse to transport munitions or troops to Malaya.

    In India, August 15 was originally the anniversary of India's "independence," but the Indian people used black flags on this day to express their indignation. The past year has been a year of deepening crisis in India. The reactionary policies adopted by the leaders of the Congress Party and the Muslim League, who compromised with Britain, have meant that none of the major issues of concern to the Indian people have been resolved. If there has been any new change in India over the past year, it is primarily the蜂起of peasant unrest, and particularly noteworthy is the anti-landlord peasant revolt in the Hyderabad state. Another noteworthy event is the progressive war against the British-backed Pakistani aggressors that broke out in the northwestern Indian state of Kashmir in October last year, and this war is still ongoing. The development of the Indian people's movement over the past year was completely unforeseen by British imperialism when it declared "Indian independence."

    Other more important events during this period include the successful conclusion of the Danube River Conference on the 18th, and the creation of a new Danube River Convention. US, British, and French imperialism suffered their first such embarrassing defeat in this conference since the war. The US-Japanese reactionaries are continuing to collude to suppress the Japanese workers' movement. Japanese democratic trade unions held a 70,000-person anti-fascist rally in Tokyo on the 15th. The Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, with four million members, has declared that "Japanese workers are determined to resist the coming oppression."

### 争取民族独立民主自由　东方人民英勇斗争

　　争取民族独立民主自由
  　东方人民英勇斗争
    最近以来东方各地争取民族独立、民主自由的人民革命运动，有许多新的发展。如缅甸人民武装斗争的扩大；菲律宾人民自卫斗争的新发展；印尼人民准备迎击荷兰的新侵略进攻等。
    缅甸人民反对英帝国主义及其走狗达钦努政府的斗争，早已发展成为武装斗争。这一斗争最近由于达钦努政府内部的志愿军不断哗变而更形紧张。据法新社透露，志愿军及宪兵之哗变者，估计最少已有四千人，其中一部分且已参加缅共领导的部队作战。现在，战争已在南缅中缅展开，尤以仰光外围为烈。达钦努政府已慌忙宣布全国处于紧急状态，政府军已由英国将军直接指挥。虽然如此，政府军的力量，连英国的曼彻斯特卫报也不能不承认是“薄弱的”。在一九四五年，缅甸共产党曾与昂山、达钦努等合组了争取缅甸独立的“反法西斯人民自由同盟”。盟员的发展一时曾达二十万人。在一九四六年的八月，在英帝国主义的怀柔、分裂政策下，以昂山为代表的资产阶级集团背叛缅甸民族革命与英国作了妥协，于今年一月成立所谓“独立政府”，并宣布缅共非法，大捕缅共人员，迫使缅共不得不单独肩负重组全国人民坚持反帝反封建斗争的巨任，并拿起武器来进行战斗。由于缅共的坚持奋斗，达钦努政府内部的矛盾遂日益增长，其志愿军及社会党中不满当局降英反共政策的分子日益增多，达钦努政府虽曾于今年五月发表所谓“左翼团结方案”，企图骗得志愿军及社会党取消组织，但受到志愿军的反对。欺骗不成，又转为镇压，达钦努开始逮捕若干志愿军分子，终于引起最近志愿军的哗变。
    菲律宾人民反对美帝国主义及季里诺政府的武装斗争有了新发展。自今年七月以来，季里诺政府在美帝国主义指使下曾策动和平阴谋，以所谓“大赦”来诱骗民抗军解除武装，并一再延长其“大赦期”。但是，这一阴谋并没有成功，当“大赦期”于八月十五日告终，季里诺发现自己依然陷于可笑的空想中时，就脑羞成怒，下令对民抗军“执行法律和秩序”。此后，菲律宾的军队和警察便向民抗军挑衅，从而引起民抗军的抵抗和出击，这种出击，连路透社也承认已对季里诺政府发生“日益严重的威胁”。
    由于美荷帝国主义坚持其使印尼共和国降为殖民地的政策，巴达维亚的政治与军事谈判已先后陷于停顿，今年一月以来存在于印荷间的“不战不和”局面已濒于破灭，荷兰帝国主义正准备发动进攻。本来，所谓“和谈”仅是美荷帝国主义准备对印尼发动新进攻的烟幕。但哈达集团及其追随者们曾幻想以“和谈”来求得有利于自己的妥协。七个月来的和谈证明，美荷殖民地统治者的胃口是如何贪婪，伦维尔协定的执行者哈达政府的妥协政策已证明只能是将刀把子送给荷兰统治者的自杀政策。印尼人民对哈达政府已日益不满。代表百万印尼工人的三十二个工会的代表大会，日前要求哈达内阁辞职，由民族阵线建立新政府，废除伦维尔协定，停止与荷兰谈判。
    越盟军于二十日起在交趾支那等地出击，以答复法国马利政府及其走狗阮文春的殖民地政策。马来亚人民反对英帝国主义压迫的武装斗争仍在英勇的坚持着。尽管愈来愈多的英军正准备投入马来亚的战争中，但英国军事当局却公开表示没有信心，悲哀的诉说着战争将持续数年。英共已向英国工人发出号召，要他们拒运军火或军队到马来亚去。
    在印度，八月十五日原是印度“独立”的周年纪念日，但印度人民却在这一天用黑旗来表示他们的激愤。过去的一年是印度危机加深的一年。对英妥协的国大党及回教同盟的领袖们所采取的反动政策，使印度人民所关怀的主要问题没有一个得到解决。如果说一年以来印度有什么新的变动，那首先就是农民骚动的蜂起，而特别引人注意的，是海德拉巴土邦内反地主的农民暴动。另一引人注意的事件，是去年十月在印度西北部克什米尔土邦内爆发的反对在英国支持下的巴基斯坦侵略者的进步战争，这一战争仍在坚持中。一年来印度人民运动的发展，是英帝国主义在宣布“印度独立”时完全没有预料到的。
    这一时期内的其他较重要事件尚有多瑙河会议已于十八日胜利闭幕，新的多瑙河公约已告产生，美英法帝国主义在这个会议中遭到战后第一次这样狼狈的失败。美日反动派仍在继续勾结以镇压日本的工人运动，日本各民主工会曾于十五日在东京举行七万人的反法西斯大会，拥有四百万会员的产联已声言“日本工人决心抵抗来临的压迫”。
