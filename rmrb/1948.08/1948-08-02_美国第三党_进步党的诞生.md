The first convention of the American Third Party, held in Philadelphia from July 23rd to 25th, officially adopted the name Progressive Party on the 23rd. In addition to nominating the Progressive Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates, the convention will also adopt the party platform and constitution, and elect the party's leadership. From now on, a new national political party has officially emerged in the United States. This is a major victory for the American people of all strata in the struggle against monopoly capital for peace and democracy.

The Third Party movement, from its inception to its current formal establishment, has taken less than two years. Its occurrence and development can be divided into the following two stages. The first is the incubation period. During this period, the American progressive labor force, centered on the Progressive Citizens of America, resolved the question of whether or not a new party was needed. The Progressive Citizens of America was an organization formed by the merger of the former National Citizens Political Action Committee and the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions in New York on New Year's Eve, 1946. Participating were also many union leaders, social celebrities, and some New Deal elements from the Roosevelt era within the Democratic Party. They were dissatisfied with the reactionary policies of monopoly capital pursued by the Truman government, but their internal opinions differed at the beginning on the question of whether or not to establish a third party. Some members, such as CIO President Murray and Senator Pepper, still harbored illusions about Truman or the Democratic Party and opposed the establishment of a third party. Only after these elements successively withdrew did the association's attitude gradually become clear. For example, in a resolution in June 1947, the association still adopted a reserved attitude towards the establishment of a third party, stating that "unless the Democratic Party can propose a progressive platform and candidates in next year's election, the association will consider organizing a third party." However, by October, the association's resolution affirmed that "Democrats cannot hope for reform within the Democratic Party." On December 17th, the association's board of directors, composed of 140 people, resolutely passed a resolution by a large majority to recommend Wallace as an independent candidate for president. Former association chairman Condon and broadcast commentator Wassell, along with fourteen others, opposed this resolution and withdrew from the association. On December 29th, under the influence of the powerful democratic movement in the United States, Wallace announced his acceptance of the recommendation, changing his attitude in September that he "still wished to remain within the Democratic Party." This finally resolved the question of whether or not there should be a third party, and brought the new party movement into a new period.

The second is the active organization period of the new party. During this period, third parties were established in various states in the United States. As of the Third Party Congress, thirty-nine of the forty-eight states in the United States had formed third parties with different names, and the remaining nine states also had organizations of Wallace election committees. These organizations were all developed from the bottom up, with the Progressive Parties of Illinois and California being established as early as last summer. This characteristic reflects the enthusiasm of the broad masses for the new party movement.

As pointed out by the famous Soviet journalist Zhukov, the Third Party is currently clearly "an organization of the broad united front of American democratic forces," including representatives of workers, farmers, blacks, progressive intellectuals, and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. They are currently all, to varying degrees, exploited and oppressed by the sixty large financial groups in the United States. Workers, farmers, and blacks are naturally trapped in poverty, hunger, and political persecution, and small and medium-sized capitalists are also unable to fairly obtain raw materials, loans, and orders. This situation has led them to form a broad united front – the Third Party – under the common demands of peace, freedom, and affluence. The organizations participating in this front include eleven national major unions affiliated with the CIO, such as the Dockworkers Union, the Electrical Workers Union, the Fur Workers Union, the Farm Equipment Union, the Food and Tobacco Union, the Transportation Union, and the Clerical and Retail Employees Union. Although the upper leadership of the three major labor organizations – the CIO, the AFL, and the Railroad Brotherhoods – oppose the Third Party, many of their local unions support the new party. In addition, the American Slavic Congress, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, the Black Youth Congress, the National Farmers Union, and the American Labor Party are all active supporters of the new party. Recently, the National Independent Businessmen's Conference, which supports the Third Party, has also been formally established.

The Communist Party of the United States has been an active advocate of establishing a broad new party of the people against monopoly capital in the United States. As early as 1945, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPUSA pointed out the need to consider establishing a third party. In December 1946, the Central Committee of the CPUSA further proposed carrying out extensive propaganda and organizational work in various states and districts of the United States without hesitation to mobilize the people to support the new party. In March of this year, after Wallace and Taylor successively served as presidential candidates for the Third Party, CPUSA Chairman Foster called on American democrats to support the new party organized by Wallace.

Wallace, who was formally nominated as the Progressive Party's presidential candidate at this convention, served as Secretary of Agriculture, Vice President, and Secretary of Commerce under President Roosevelt. He opposes the domestic and foreign policies of the United States that represent monopoly capital, but as he himself said, his purpose in fighting for peace is to "guarantee the victory of a progressive capitalist system," implementing reform measures such as the nationalization of certain large industries, price controls, mass production, and high wages. CPUSA Chairman Foster once pointed out that Wallace is the "outstanding spokesperson" of the smaller bourgeoisie in the United States. Vice-presidential candidate Taylor is a senator from Idaho, originally a New Deal faction within the Democratic Party. Because of his support for the interests of workers and farmers, he enjoys considerable prestige among workers and farmers in the western states of the United States. He withdrew from the Democratic Party on February 28th of this year.

The development of the Third Party movement to its current scale in a short period of time has naturally caused great panic among the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States. From now on, the Democratic and Republican parties will no longer be able to use their arbitrary propaganda and huge party machinery to deceive voters and monopolize votes as they have in the past. With the establishment of the Progressive Party, the American people have broken free from the shackles of the formal two-party system and have the opportunity to choose a third party. The Progressive Party will surely win millions of votes in future elections and play an increasingly important role in American political life. Naturally, the Progressive Party is still a young new organization, and there will be many difficulties and obstacles in its future development. Therefore, when Wallace himself answered reporters' questions at a reception on July 23rd about whether the new party could win in this year's election, he said that he had never stated that the new party would achieve a decisive victory in this election, but he believed that the votes obtained by the new party would be more than estimated by professional testers. Regarding this point, the Soviet Bolshevik magazine commented: "Regardless of the outcome of the election, the establishment of the new party will play a positive role in mobilizing the progressive forces of the American people to fight against the reactionaries."

### 美国第三党——进步党的诞生

    美国第三党——进步党的诞生
    七月二十三日至二十五日在费城举行的美国第三党第一届代表大会，已于二十三日正式通过命名新党为进步党。大会除了提名进步党的正副总统竞选候选人外，还将通过党纲、党章，选举党的领导机关。从此，一个新的全国性政党在美国正式出现了。这是美国反独占资本的各阶层人民在争取和平民主的斗争中一个重大胜利。
    第三党运动从它的胚胎到目前的正式成立，时间不及两年。它的发生与发展，可以分为下面两个时期。第一是酝酿时期。在这个时期中，美国进步劳力以美国进步公民协会为中心，解决了要不要一个新党的问题。进步公民协会是由前全国公民政治行动委员会及独立艺术、科学与自由职业公民委员会两个组织，于一九四六年除夕在纽约合并组成的一个团体。参加的还有许多工会领袖、社会名流以及民主党内的一些罗斯福时代的新政分子。他们不满杜鲁门政府所奉行的独占资本的反动政策，但他们之间在是否需要成立第三党问题上，内部意见开始时并不一致。有些会员，如产联主席莫莱及参议员泼贝尔等，仍对杜鲁门或民主党怀抱幻想，反对成立第三党，协会在这些分子相继退出之后，态度才逐渐明确。例如在一九四七年六月的决议中，协会对成立第三党问题还采取保留的态度，声明“除非民主党在明年大选中能提出进步的政纲与候选人，则协会将考虑组织第三党”。但至十月，协会的决议即肯定“民主人士不能希望民主党的革新”。十二月十七日，由一百四十人组成的协会理事会便毅然以绝大多数通过推荐华莱士以独立候选人资格出来竞选总统。协会的前主席金敦及广播评论员华绥等十四人反对这一决议，并退出了协会。十二月二十九日，在美国有力的民主运动影响之下华莱士宣布接受推荐，改变了他九月间“仍愿留在民主党内”的态度。这样，就最后地解决了要不要有一个第三党的问题，并使新党运动进入了新的时期。
    第二是新党的积极组织时期。在此时期中，美国各州纷纷成立了第三党。截至第三党大会时为止，美国四十八州中已有三十九州组成了名目不同的第三党，其余九个州也有拥护华莱士竞选委员会分会的组织。这些组织都是自下而上发展起来的，其中伊利诺斯与加利福尼亚两州的进步党在去年夏季即已成立。这一特点反映了广大群众对新党运动的积极性。
    如苏联名记者朱可夫指出的，第三党目前显然是“美国民主势力广泛的统一战线的组织”，包括工人、农民、黑人、进步知识分子和中小企业家的代表。他们目前在美国，都在不同程度上受到六十家大财阀的剥削与压迫，工人、农民与黑人固然陷于贫困、饥饿与政治上受迫害，中小资本家也无法公平获取原料、贷款和定货。这种情况就使他们在和平、自由、富足的共同要求下结成一个广泛的统一阵线——第三党。参加这一阵线的组织，在工会方面有产联所属的码头工会、电气工会、毛皮工会、农具工会、粮食烟草工会、运输工会、职员与店员工会等十一个全国性的大工会。三大劳工组织——产运、劳联、铁路工会的上层领导机构虽然反对第三党，但它们之中的许多地方工会是拥护新党的。此外，美籍斯拉夫人大会、南方人类福利大会、黑人青年大会、全国农民同盟、美国劳工党等，都是新党的积极支持者。最近，支持第三党的全国独立企业家会议，也正式成立了。
    美国共产党曾是主张在美国成立一个广泛反独占资本的人民新政党的积极倡导者。远在一九四五年，美共中央全会即指出有考虑成立第三党的必要。一九四六年十二月，美共中央进一步提出毫不迟疑地在美国各州、各区进行广泛宣传与组织工作，以发动人民支持新党。今年三月，在华莱士与泰勒先后出任第三党总统候选人之后，美共主席福斯特曾号召美国民主人士，赞助华莱士所组织的新党。
    被这次大会正式提名为进步党总统候选人的华莱士，在罗斯福总统任内曾做过农业部长、副总统和商务部长等职。他反对美国的代表独占资本的内政与外交政策，但如他自己所说的，他为和平斗争的目的，是为了“保证进步的资本主义制度的胜利”，实行某些大工业的国有化、管制物价、大量生产与高额工资等改良措施。美共主席福斯特曾指出，华莱士是美国较小的资产阶级的“杰出的代言人”。副总统候选人泰勒是爱达荷州的参议员，原为民主党内的新政派，由于拥护工农利益，他在美国西部各州的工人、农民中，颇具声望。他于今年二月二十八日退出民主党。
    第三党运动在短期内发展至今日的规模，自然引起了美国民主党和共和党两党的巨大惊慌。从今以后，民主、共和两党就不能象过去那样利用其武断宣传、庞大的党的机构来愚弄选民和垄断选票了。由于进步党的成立，美国人民摆脱了形式上的两党制的束缚，而有了选择第三个政党的机会。进步党在未来大选中必将赢得成百万张的选票，并在美国政治生活中起着日益重要的作用。自然，进步党现在还是年轻的新组织，在其今后的发展中还会有不少困难和障碍。因此，华莱士本人七月二十三日在招待记者会上回答新党是否能在今年大选中获胜时说：他从未表示新党将在这次大选中获得决定性胜利，但他相信新党所获之选票，将较职业测验家估计者为多。关于此点，苏联布尔塞维克杂志曾评论称：“不论选举的结果如何，新党的成立将在动员美国人民进步力量向反动派斗争中，起积极的作用”。
