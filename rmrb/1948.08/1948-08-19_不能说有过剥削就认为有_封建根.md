Cannot assume there are "feudal roots" just because there was exploitation
    Editor:
    I have a few difficult questions I hope you can answer:
    1. What kind of person is a prosperous middle peasant? Are they an object of the revolution or an ally of the revolution? For example, if they were a rich peasant ten years before the incident (the revolution), but after drastic changes (bankruptcy), they rose again to become a middle peasant with the support of the Communist Party's policies, should such a person still be considered to have feudal roots when classifying their class status?
    They used to be a rich peasant, owning fifty or sixty mu of land and hiring long-term laborers. They began to decline before 1930, and by the time of the incident, they only had less than twenty mu of land left (for seventeen people), owing more than a thousand yuan in debt, and had not exploited anyone for a long time. When the family separated in 1939, each family only received three sheng of bran and five or six mu of land. After the Communist Party's policies (rent reduction and interest rate reduction, local redemption), and labor saving (being a labor hero for two years, doing work for others for two winter days), their life rose again (to the level of a middle peasant). How should such a family's class status be determined?
    2. Due to participation in the revolution, the family has no labor force (four people joined the army during the incident, leaving only orphans, widows, and the elderly). If a worker was hired in 1937, can this exploitation be considered a standard for classifying class status?
    3. If industrialists, merchants, and middle peasant households are wrongly struggled against, they must be resolutely returned. If revolutionary fighters are also subtly purged, how should this be handled?
                                                                    Li Shaofu

    Answer: 1. A prosperous middle peasant is part of the middle peasant class, whose life is better than that of ordinary middle peasants, and generally has slight exploitation of others (not exceeding 25% of the family's total annual income). Middle peasants (including prosperous middle peasants) are permanent allies of the revolution. Classifying prosperous middle peasants from the middle peasant class is to protect the middle peasants from being classified as rich peasants due to their slight exploitation and being infringed upon. Therefore, treating prosperous middle peasants as objects of the revolution is wrong. In your question, the rich peasant family declined in 1930 and later rose to become a middle peasant, so they should be treated as a middle peasant. Those who declined before the incident should not be said to have "feudal roots" just because they had exploitation. The method of forcibly finding "feudal roots" is to intentionally raise the class status of some people, which is inconsistent with the principle of determining class status solely based on occupation. If, after rising, they occupy more and better land, own livestock, agricultural tools, and other means of production, participate in agricultural labor themselves, but regularly rely on capitalist methods of exploiting hired laborers or other capitalist exploitation income as the main or important part of their livelihood for three consecutive years, they are new-style rich peasants. Otherwise, if they are middle peasants, they should still be classified as middle peasants.
    2. Those who hire workers because they have no labor force in the family due to participation in revolutionary work should not be calculated as exploitation when classifying class status.
    3. Regarding the issue of confiscation of revolutionary fighter families, if it is a case of wrongly struggling against industrialists, merchants, and middle peasants, it should be returned or compensated according to law. If they are truly landlords or rich peasants, it is right to liquidate or collect their feudal exploitation part according to law, and they should not be exempted from liquidation just because they are revolutionary fighters.

                                                                                                —Editor

### 不能说有过剥削就认为有“封建根”

专栏：询问与答复

　　不能说有过剥削就认为有“封建根”
    编辑同志：
    我有几个疑难问题，希答复：
    一、什么样的是富裕中农，他是革命的对象还是革命的同盟军？如事变前十年是富农，但经过激烈的变动（破产）后，又在共产党政策扶植下起来上升为中农，这样的人划成份是否还有封建根？
    以前是富农，有地五六十亩，长年雇工，一九三○年前开始下降，至事变时仅剩下不足二十亩地（十七口人），欠债千元以上，好久即不剥削人了。一九三九年分家时，每家只分三升麸子和五六亩地，经共产党的政策（减租减息，当地赎回），和劳动节约（当二年劳动英雄，给人做活两天冬），生活又上升（相当中农），这样的家庭应如何确定成份。
    二、因参加革命，家里无劳动力（事变时四人参军，只剩孤寡老幼），如在三七年雇工一个，这种剥削能算为划成份的标准否？
    三、工商业、中农户，错斗了要坚决退回，如革命战士也被变象的清算了应该如何处理？　　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　李少甫
    答：一、富裕中农是中农的一部分，其生活较好于普通中农，一般对别人有轻微的剥削（不超过全家一年总收入的百分之二十五）。中农（包括富裕中农在内）是革命的永久同盟者；从中农层中划出富裕中农，是为了保护中农，不致因其有轻微剥削而被划成富农来侵犯，因此把富裕中农当成革命对象是错误的。你所提该户富农一九三○年即下降，后又生活上升为中农，即应以中农论。事变前即下降者，不能因有过剥削就说有“封建根”。硬找“封建根”的办法，是有意提高一部分人的成份，与只按占有关系定成份的原则不合。如果上升后占有较多较好的土地，占有耕畜、农具及其他生产资料，自己参加农业劳动，但经常依靠资本主义方法剥削雇工或其他资本主义剥削的收入，作为其生活来源的主要或重要部分并连续三年者，是新式富农。否则该是中农仍订为中农。
    二、因参加革命工作，家中无劳力而雇工者，划成份时不得按剥削计算。
    三、革命战士家庭被没收问题，如系错斗工商业与中农，亦应依法退回或补偿。如真是地主或富农成份，依法清算或征收其封建剥削部分是应该的，不能因是革命战士而不清算。
