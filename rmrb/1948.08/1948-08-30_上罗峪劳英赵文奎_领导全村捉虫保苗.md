(North Yue News) Zhao Wenkui, a labor hero from Shangluoyu in the Sixth District of Jingxing, actively organized the masses to eliminate pests. The village had just rescued 83 mu of millet and sorghum from drought, and replanted 130 mu of vegetables after the rain. Now, a serious insect plague has been discovered. The area affected by the insects is 1408 zhang long and 450 zhang wide. More than one mu of vegetable land has already been completely eaten, and a lot of millet has also been eaten. The labor hero Zhao Wenkui, on the evening of discovering the insect infestation, immediately convened a village meeting to study methods of killing insects. He cited the example of 1943, when the village suffered a great loss even though the insect infestation area was small, introduced the experience of catching insects that year, and proposed organizing to fight insects and save seedlings. Based on their own experiences, everyone unanimously agreed with his method. A pest control committee was immediately established, with two sections: inspection and distribution. The inspection section is responsible for checking the insect infestation, and the distribution section is responsible for allocating manpower to organize insect catching. The whole village was divided into five insect catching groups, and a five-day insect catching blitz week was decided. The next day, all men, women, and children in the village took action. After a day of effort, they had caught the insects on 82 mu of vegetable land and more than 30 mu of millet land. This time, they adopted two methods to catch the insects: (1) The insects on the vegetable leaves are difficult to catch, so use the roots and stems of tobacco, star fruit leaves, and Acanthopanax leaves to boil water and sprinkle it on the leaves. Some insects can be poisoned to death, and those that are not poisoned will run away, and then people will surround and beat them, and catch the chickens from each house to eat the insects in the fields. One chicken is worth more than ten people catching insects. (2) Most of the insects on the millet have already burrowed into the stalks and are difficult to catch (but don't pull them out, because most millet has them), so also sprinkle the above-mentioned medicinal water on the millet to eliminate the insects. Sprinkle medicinal water on the edges of the land that is not infested with insects, so that the insects will not crawl into the land.

　　上罗峪劳英赵文奎
  　领导全村捉虫保苗
    【北岳讯】井陉六区上罗峪劳动英雄赵文奎，积极组织群众除害虫。该村刚刚从旱灾中抢救出八十三亩谷子、高粱，雨后补种了一百三十亩菜，现在又发现了严重的虫灾。虫害面积长一千四百零八丈，宽四百五十丈。已有一亩多菜地全被吃光，谷子也被吃不少。劳动英雄赵文奎，在发现虫害的当天晚上，即召开了村民大会，研究杀虫办法。他举出一九四三年该村虫害面积虽小，但所受损失很大的例子，介绍了那年捉虫的经验，提出组织起来打虫救苗。大家根据切身体验，一致同意他的办法。当即成立了捉虫委员会，下设检查、分配两股，检查股负责检查虫害情况，分配股负责分配人力组织捉虫。全村分成五个捉虫小组，决定了五天的捉虫突击周。次日全村男女老少即行动起来，经一天努力，已把八十二亩菜地，三十多亩谷地的虫子捉光了。此次捉虫，他们采取了两种办法：（一）菜叶上的虫很难捉，用烟根烟杆、杨桃叶、五加皮三样东西，熬成水洒在叶上，有的虫能毒死，毒不死的就要外跑，再用人围打，并把各家小鸡捉到地内吃虫，一个小鸡能顶十来个人打。（二）谷子上的虫大部分已钻到杆内不好捉（但也不要拔了，因为大部分谷上都有），也用以上药水洒在谷上即将虫消灭，没有虫害的地边洒上药水，虫子即不往地里爬了。　　　　　　　　　　　（张根兵）
