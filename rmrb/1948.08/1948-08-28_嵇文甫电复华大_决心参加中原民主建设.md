　　Ji Wenfu Cables Reply to North China University
  　Determined to Participate in Central Plains Democratic Construction
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 21st] Professors Ji Wenfu, Wang Yizhai, and students, who previously arrived in the Central Plains from Kaifeng, have cabled a reply to Principal Wu Yuzhang, Vice Principals Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu, Provost Qian Junrui, and all faculty and students of North China University, who welcomed them. The cable stated: "For many years, we have been longing for the liberated areas and longing for you. However, understanding that the democratic construction of the Central Plains needs more people to take on responsibilities, we are determined to participate in the work here. The Central Plains University has now officially begun preparations. In addition to the more than 300 students who came from Kaifeng, youths from various places are enthusiastically enrolling. We urgently hope that you will inform us in detail of North China University's learning organization, life experience, and various regulations so that we can follow your lead." It is noted that all faculty and students of North China University sent a cable to Ji Wenfu and others on July 24 to express their welcome and regards. Ji Wenfu and Wang Yizhai are currently both deputy directors of the preparatory committee for Central Plains University.
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] Young students from Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, and other places, unable to bear the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, are fleeing to the liberated areas one after another. In July, 36 people, including Kong Fanyan, fled to the Ji-Lu-Yu area from Chiang Kai-shek occupied cities such as Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, Jinan, and Xuzhou. Most of them are middle school and normal school students who are very dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and his deception and oppression of students. They said: "In the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, we are monitored by secret agents everywhere. To read some patriotic and democratic books and newspapers, we often have to do it at night. After reading, we hide them in holes in the wall and have to be constantly on guard against inspection and arrest by secret agents." They eat two meals of cornmeal a day, and sometimes they don't even have vegetables, just plain boiled water. Publicly funded students can only eat two meals of thin porridge because of corruption by the school. This April, students in Zhengzhou only received 5,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency per day for living expenses, which was not enough to buy half a catty of steamed buns. Female student Zhang Ziping said: "No matter how strict the secret agents' blockade and inspection are on the road, we have to risk our lives to reach the liberated areas." Wang Jun wrote in a letter secretly left to his parents: "I am going to seek the light, please do not worry about me." After they arrived in the liberated areas, they were welcomed and cared for by our military and government agencies along the way. Now the administrative office has, according to their requests, introduced some to work, and others to study at the Construction College and North China University.

　　嵇文甫电复华大
  　决心参加中原民主建设
    【新华社中原二十一日电】前由开封抵中原之嵇文甫、王毅斋教授及学生等顷电复欢迎他们的华北大学吴玉章校长、范文澜、成仿吾副校长、钱俊瑞教务长及全体教职学员，电中称：“多年来我们一直向往着解放区，向往着你们。但了解到中原民主建设更需要人担任，所以决心参加这里的工作。现在中原大学已正式开始筹备，除从开封出来的三百余同学外，各地青年入学者极为踊跃。我们迫切的希望你们把华北大学的学习组织、生活经验及各种章则详告，俾资倡趋。”按华北大学全体教职学员曾于七月二十四日致电嵇文甫等，对他们表示欢迎与慰问之忱。嵇文甫与王毅斋现均为中原大学筹委会副主任。
    【冀鲁豫电】郑州、徐州等地的青年学生，不堪蒋匪压迫，纷纷逃来解放区。七月份从郑州、商邱、济南、徐州等蒋占城市，逃来冀鲁豫区者，有孔繁衍等三十六名。他们大部分是中学与师范学生，对蒋介石匪帮的卖国独裁及对学生的欺骗压迫，十分不满。他们说：“在蒋区处处被特务们监视着，要看些爱国民主书报，多是在夜间。看后藏在墙洞里，还得随时防备特务的检查和逮捕。”他们每天吃两顿玉米面，有时连菜也吃不上，只喝白开水。公费生因校方贪污，只能吃两顿稀饭，今年四月，郑州学生每天只分到五千元蒋币的生活费，买不到半斤馍。女同学张子平说：“不管路上为特务封锁盘查怎严，拼死也得走到解放区”。王俊在偷偷留给家长的信中说：“我寻求光明去了，请不要挂念我”。他们来到解放区后，沿途受到我军政机关的欢迎和照顾。现行署已根据他们的要求，有的介绍工作，有的到建国学院及华北大学学习。
