　　【Taiyue Telegram】A thorough inspection of the production situation in Panzhuang Village, Sixth District of Qinshui, revealed that more than 30 mu of planted corn, sesame, and millet were abandoned. Over 50 mu of old wheat fields were overgrown with artemisia over a foot high; a five-mu plot of sesame had only two or three small flowers on each plant; six or seven plots of replanted corn had weeds taller than the corn itself, and each corn stalk, already with five leaves, was only half a foot high, with the leaves turning yellow; and over a dozen abandoned plots of millet, though the ears had emerged, were barely distinguishable from the weeds. The masses working in the fields were listless and sluggish, only carrying their hoes to the fields when it was time for breakfast, and returning before noon. In the afternoon, when the sun had already begun to set, some people were still resting at home. One person could not hoe even half a mu of land in a day. The main reason for the low morale of the masses in this village was that over 30 middle-peasant households were mistakenly classified as landlords and rich peasants last winter, and this has not been corrected to this day. He Xixing, the chairman of the farmers' association, a well-to-do middle peasant, had been wrongly classified as a landlord last winter, and had been sleeping at home all day for some time, and his status has not yet been corrected. The branch secretary and village head openly stated that they would not lead production. The district committee told them "to properly organize the masses to weed the seedlings," but the village head openly said, "Does production and farming need to be said? Which peasant doesn't know how to farm!" Even his own land was abandoned for several mu. Village cadres blamed each other for the mistakes in their past work, shifted responsibility, were not united, and completely ignored production. The district also failed to closely lead the production work in this village. The Sixth District Committee and the District Office both resided in Panzhuang Village, and the responsible cadres went out for walks every afternoon, watching the abandoned land gradually increase, but they did not investigate the reasons, nor did they think of ways to overcome the problem. The wrongly classified thirty-odd middle-peasant households were investigated and clarified twenty days ago, but the correction has not been announced to this day. They said, "Let's announce it after the middle peasant meeting." Now, five days have passed since the middle peasant meeting, and the correction has still not been announced, which has been affecting the production morale of the middle peasants and other classes. Only after the district-wide meeting on August 7th did the District Committee begin to be vigilant and start working with the village cadres to study corrective measures.

　　潘庄纠偏不力
  　生产遭受损失
    【太岳电】沁水六区深入检查潘庄村生产情况，发现种上的玉茭、芝麻和谷子荒了三十多亩。五十多亩老麦地长着一尺多高的青蒿；五亩大的一块芝麻，每棵只开有两三个小花；六七块回茬玉茭，杂草长的比玉茭还高，每个玉茭已五个叶了，还只有半尺高，叶子已变成了黄色；十几块荒了的谷，穗子虽已吐出，但和毛草差不多。上地的群众都是松里松气，吃早饭时才扛着锄头去上地，天不晌午就回来了。下午太阳已偏西了，有些人还在家里歇晌。一天一个人锄不下半亩地。这村群众生产情绪这样低，主要是因为去冬把三十多户中农错划成地主富农，到现在还没改正过来。农会主席富裕中农何希行，因年时冬天被错划成地主，前些时成天在家里睡觉，到现在他的成份还未改正过来。支部书记和村长公开表示不领导生产，区分委告他们说“要好好组织群众锄苗”，村长公开说：“生产种地还用说？哪个群众不会种地！”他自己的地也荒了好几亩。村干部对过去工作中的错误互相埋怨，互推责任，闹不团结，对生产完全不管，区上对这村生产工作也没抓紧领导。六区分委会和区公所都住在潘庄村，负责干部每天下午出去散步，眼看着荒地逐渐增加，但并不调查原因，也不想克服办法。错划的三十多户中农，二十天以前已调查清楚，可是一直到今天还不宣布纠正。他们说：“等开罢中农会再宣布吧”。现在开过中农会又五天了，还没宣布改正。一直影响着中农和其他阶层的生产情绪。直至八月七号召开全区会议后，区分委会才开始提起警惕，开始和村干部共同研究改正办法。
