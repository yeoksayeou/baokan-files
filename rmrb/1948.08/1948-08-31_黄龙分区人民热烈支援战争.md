　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: The people of the Huanglong sub-region are warmly supporting the Northwest People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive in the southern front. Zhao Quande, the stretcher squad leader of the stretcher teams in Jietoumiao and Tuji areas of Huanglong County, carried the wounded on his back for more than twenty li on narrow roads where stretchers could not pass. When the enemy stationed in Jinsuoguan, Tongguan, gathered and attempted to raid a unit of our army stationed in Kuquan Town, the farmers of Nanwan Village, upon learning of this, immediately detoured to report it, enabling our army to quickly enter the position. In particular, the people of Fuping and Chengcheng, who had been liberated again, were even more enthusiastic when they saw the Northwest People's Liberation Army again. In Huangfuzhen, north of Fuping City, a woman was shot in the leg by the enemy while trying to help our reconnaissance personnel escape. On August 6th, when a unit of the People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared near Fuping, farmers automatically led the way for our army and enthusiastically informed the residents of each village along the way: "Our own army is back!" The masses in each village put out boiled water, steamed buns, vegetables, small melons, watermelons, and other comforts at their doors. Old women recounted the various crimes of the enemy. In the ten days that a certain village north of Chengcheng was occupied by bandits, thirteen *shi* of peas, three *shi* of bran, and one thousand *jin* of grass were looted. All the chickens in the village were caught; even the dozen or so eggs hidden by the farmers in the toilet were searched for and taken away.

　　黄龙分区人民热烈支援战争
    【新华社西北二十五日电】黄龙分区人民热烈支援此次西北解放军的南线反击战。黄龙县界头庙和洛川土基两区的担架队的担架班长赵全德，在担架不能通过的窄路上，就背着伤员走了二十多里路。当驻同官金锁关的敌人集结起来，企图奔袭驻苦泉镇我军某部时，南湾村农民得知后，立即绕道赶来报告，得使我军迅速进入阵地。特别是重获解放的＠阳、澄城人民，在重见西北人民解放军时，更为热情。＠阳城北皇甫镇妇女，为掩护我侦察员脱险，有一位竟被敌人击伤腿部。八月六日，当解放军某部突然出现于＠阳附近时，农民自动为我军带路，并热情地沿途告知各村居民：“咱们自己的军队回来了！”各村群众，在门口摆出了开水、馍、菜、小瓜、西瓜等慰劳品。老太太们则申诉着敌人的种种罪行。澄城北某村在胡匪侵占的十天内，就被掠夺走豌豆十三石，麸子三石，草一千斤，全村的鸡被抓光；连农民家藏在厕所里的十多颗鸡蛋也被搜走。
