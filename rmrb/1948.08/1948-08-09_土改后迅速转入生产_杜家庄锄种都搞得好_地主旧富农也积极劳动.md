Rapidly Shift to Production After Land Reform
    Du Jia Zhuang Does Well in Weeding and Planting
    Landlords and Old Rich Peasants Also Labor Actively
    [This Newspaper Reports] A dispatch from a general branch reporter: In Du Jia Zhuang, Seventh District, Huolu, due to the correct implementation of the land reform policy, social order is stable, all classes are united in production, and morale is high. The rush to plant and harvest is about to be fully completed. This village was liberated last September. The whole village has 343 households (including four landlord households, fourteen rich peasant households, one hundred and ninety-nine middle peasant households, and one hundred and twenty-six poor peasant households), with 3,072 mu of land. Last winter's land reform began with the struggle against two landlords and two rich peasants. In March of this year, according to Comrade Ren Bishi's report on the criteria for class division, another two landlord households and twelve rich peasant households were identified, totaling eighteen landlord and rich peasant households, accounting for 5.2 percent of the total number of households in the village. In mid-May, after careful review of their composition, the fruits were distributed. A total of more than 800 mu of land belonging to landlords and rich peasants were confiscated and requisitioned, as well as eleven head of livestock... This satisfied the demands of landless and land-poor peasants and consolidated the unity of the middle peasants (the interests of the middle peasants were not harmed in the slightest during the land reform in this village). After pouring out their grievances and turning over a new leaf, the peasants' level of awareness has been greatly raised. In the land reform, landlords were appropriately given a share, and rich peasants were allowed to keep a share. The average output per person for poor and hired peasants in the village was 7.63 dan, 7 dan for rich peasants, and 6.8 dan for landlords.

    After the land reform came to an end, the village rapidly shifted to large-scale production. After the first rain of the summer, the whole village immediately began sowing. The land of military and cadre family members and labor draftees was also cultivated on their behalf, and the vast majority achieved full seedlings. In early and mid-July, there was a prolonged drought without rain, and the drought was serious. The whole village immediately launched drought resistance and seedling preparation, and two-thirds of the land was hoed twice to seal the seedlings and resist drought (piling the soil around the seedlings' roots to make them drought-resistant). Many households actively carried water to plant or dry-plant, waiting for rain. The women's work team of Dong Youmin's mother carried water back and forth for a li, and planted more than 7,000 sweet potato seedlings for three households. On average, each household in the village planted more than half a mu of radishes and sweet potato seedlings. Bian Wende, chairman of the farmers' association, dry-planted eight fen of radishes and planted 3,000 sweet potato seedlings. They constantly replanted the drought-stricken seedlings, replanting more than 800 seedlings the first time and more than 100 seedlings the second time. At that time, the farmers' association put forward the slogan "collect more leaves and plant more vegetables, planting vegetables for half a year's food," and exchanged the eight jin of radish seeds stored by the farmers' association for seeds to each household. Two days before the rain, the farmers' association held a cadre meeting to discuss saving and preparing for famine. At this time, the sky became overcast, and someone said, "Let's not discuss collecting leaves, let's quickly plan for seeds." Everyone decided to prepare seeds after the rain. The next day, Bian Wende, chairman of the farmers' association, and village representatives went to each household to exchange five dou of "sixty-day return to granary grain" seeds. Then, there was a heavy rain, and the farmers' association immediately broadcasted a notice to each household to come and exchange grain seeds. Some households demonstrated a spirit of love and mutual assistance and made their own adjustments.

    The seed problem was largely solved, and many peasants immediately braved the rain to plant and replant. Dong Jinxiang, Wu Gengchang, and more than 30 others braved the rain to replant rice seedlings (digging up dense seedlings and planting them in sparse places). Three able-bodied women, Ms. He, Dong Fengni, and Dong Chenni, braved the rain and worked to plant more than one mu of sweet potato seedlings. When the rain stopped on the 22nd, Dong Xi and Dong Shirong immediately repaired the collapsed field dikes and replanted sweet potato seedlings because the ground was wet and they could not hoe. Many households mobilized their entire families to rush to hoe and plant. Zhang Furong and her husband locked the door every day to hoe and replant seedlings, and also applied 400 jin of topdressing fertilizer. The two sons and two daughters-in-law of rich peasant Li Yubao had not done much work in the past, but they worked very diligently after the land reform. This time, all five of them, father and sons, went to the fields to rush to plant and hoe, and their crops are among the best in the village. Rich peasant Li Huaiqi and the two landlord households are also very active in production, and their crops are no weaker than those of ordinary households. District and village cadres have repeatedly educated the landlords and rich peasants, saying: "Land reform is to eliminate feudalism and develop production. Since you no longer have feudalism, you must produce well. As long as you produce well, the peasants will help you well."

    The 130 mu of radishes that were dry-planted before the rain in the village sprouted completely two or three days after the rain. By July 26, the whole village had finished planting, and by July 29, the whole village had hoed more than 2,000 mu. It is estimated that it will be completely hoed by August 2nd or 3rd.

    土改后迅速转入生产
    杜家庄锄种都搞得好
    地主旧富农也积极劳动
    【本报讯】总分社记者报导：获鹿七区杜家庄，由于端正的执行了土改政策，社会秩序安定，各阶层团结生产，情绪高涨。现抢种抢收即将全部完成。该村系去年九月解放。全村三四三户（内地主四户、富农十四户、中农一九九户、贫农一二六户），有地三○七二亩。去冬土改，开始先斗争两户地主、两户富农，今年三月间又按任弼时同志报告的划阶级标准，续划出了地主两户、富农十二户，前后共划出地、富十八户，占全村总户数百分之五点二。五月中旬经慎重审查成份后，才分配了果实。计没收与征收地、富土地八百余亩，牲口十一头……。满足了无地少地农民的要求，巩固的团结了中农（该村在土改中未丝毫损害中农利益）。农民经过诉苦翻心，觉悟程度大为提高。土改中并适当的给地主分了一份，给富农留了一份。全村贫雇农每人平均产量七点六三石，富农七石、地主六点八石。
    土改告一段落后，该村迅速转入大生产。入夏第一次雨后，全村立即展开播种。军、干家属及出征民工的地也都按时代耕种上，绝大部获得全苗。七月上、中旬久旱未雨，旱象严重，全村即展开抗旱备苗，并有三分之二的土地锄了二遍，封苗抗旱（把苗周围的土堆到苗根上，使其耐旱）。有不少户积极挑水点种，或干种待雨。东佑民娘的妇女拨工组，来回一里地担水抬水，三户共点压红薯秧七千余棵。全村每户点压红薯秧、干种萝＠平均各有半亩多。农会主席边文德一户就干种了萝＠八分、压了三千棵红薯秧。不断旱苗不断补种，第一次补了八百余棵，第二次补了一百余棵。当时农会提出“多采树叶多种菜，种菜半年粮”的号召，把农会存的八斤萝＠籽都换给各户，在下雨以前两天，农会召开干部会，讨论节约备荒。这时天阴了，有人说：“咱不要讨论采树叶了，赶快计划种籽吧”。大家决议先准备雨后种籽。次日农会主席边文德和村代表们分头深入各户，调换了五斗“六十天还仓谷”种。接着下了大雨，农会马上广播通知各户来换谷种。有些户发挥友爱互助的精神，自行做了调剂。
    种籽困难大致解决了，不少农民即冒雨抢种、补种。东进祥、武根常等三十余人冒雨补栽谷苗（把稠苗挖下栽到稀处）。壮年妇女何某某、东凤妮、东陈妮三人冒雨拨工栽了一亩多红薯秧。二十二号雨停了，东喜，东世荣因地湿不能锄，马上修整塌了的地堰，补上红薯苗。好些户全家总动员抢锄抢种，张福荣和他男人天天锁门去锄苗补种，还上了追肥四百斤。富农李玉保的两个儿子，两个儿媳，过去没干过什么活，土改后劳动很勤谨；这次他们父子五人都到地里抢种抢锄，他的庄稼长的在全村很数的着。富农李怀起和两户地主生产也很积极，庄稼长的不比一般户弱。区村干部曾几次教育地主富农说：“土改是为了消灭封建，发展生产。你们没封建了就要好好生产。只要好好生产，农民会很好的帮助你们。”
    该村雨前干种的一三零亩萝＠，雨后两三天即出全了苗。七月二十六号全村抢种完毕，至二十九号全村已锄了两千多亩，估计八月二、三号可全部锄完。
