　　Engineer Li Maoxuan invents cotton gin
    [Taiyue Telegram] Engineer Li Maoxuan of the Taiyue Xinghua Public-operated Yarn Factory has invented a "drawing frame" to replace the foreign steel wire carding machine, and the trial results are very good. The machine is modified from the existing cotton gin, using iron bars instead of steel wires. The most precise and difficult parts are the burr roller and the feed plate. The distance between the two is best at twelve thousandths of an inch, but because our equipment is incomplete, the saw teeth produced are difficult to maintain a certain precise size. If it is slightly wider, it will not be able to comb out the small knots in the fiber and remove impurities. If it is slightly closer, it will damage the fiber, which will affect the quality of the yarn. After more than a month of painstaking research and repeated modifications five or six times, all difficulties were finally overcome, and the experiment was successful in May of this year. Two units have now been manufactured, each producing three catties of cotton sliver per hour, ensuring the supply of the fine spinning machine. In July, the daily output reached 77 catties and 6 taels of 16-count yarn. A wider design is now being planned to double its output. Engineer Li Maoxuan told reporters: "The efficiency of the drawing frame is still not as good as the steel wire carding machine, but it is only for the urgent need to supply the people's textile industry, and it is only for trial use for the time being, and it needs to be continuously improved." The "steel wire machine," also known as a carding machine, is the most important part of the spinning machine, and is specifically used to remove impurities from cotton wool and comb fibers. Before the war, only the Shanghai Dalong Iron Works could manufacture it. However, the steel wire used also had to be purchased from abroad.

　　工程师李茂轩发明梳棉机
    【太岳电】太岳兴华公营纱厂工程师李茂轩同志发明“拉条机”，代替外国钢丝机，试验效果很好。该机系以现有的弹花机改制，以铁条代替钢丝而成。其中最精细最困难的是剌毛滚与进花板，两者相距以一英寸的千分之十二为最宜，但因我们设备不全，制出的锯齿很难保持一定精确的尺寸，稍宽就梳不开纤维中的小圪＠，去不净杂质。稍近则损伤纤维，都会影响到纱的质量。经过一个多月的苦心研究，反复五六次的改造，终于克服了一切困难，在今年五月试验成功。现已制成两部，每部每小时可出棉条三斤，保证了细纱机的供给。七月份已达日产十六支纱七十七斤六两。现正设计加宽，使其产量能提高一倍。李茂轩工程师告记者说：“拉条机效能还不及钢丝机，只是急于供给人民纺织业的需要，暂先试用，还需要继续改进。”按“钢丝机”也叫梳棉机，是纺纱机中最重要的部分，是专管清除棉絮中杂质和梳理纤维用的。战前全国只有上海大隆铁厂可以制造。但所用钢丝亦须购自外国。
