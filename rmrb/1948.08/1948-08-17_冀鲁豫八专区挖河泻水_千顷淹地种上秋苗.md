　　Ji-Lu-Yu Eighth Special District Digs Rivers to Drain Water
    Thousands of Acres of Flooded Land Planted with Autumn Seedlings
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] The rivers within the Eighth Special District are often silted up due to years of disrepair, causing more than a thousand acres of fertile land to be flooded year after year. Starting in mid-July, the Eighth Special Commissioner's Office seized the agricultural slack season to lead the masses in digging rivers. Except for Qingfeng, all counties have now completed their work, having dredged the Majia River (Nanle-Puyang section), Zhulong River, Xiao River, Sha River (Nanle section), and a large ditch in Neihuang, as well as seven water ditches in Nanle section's first district, totaling 122,650 meters in length. This involved 165,312 workdays. After the dredging of the Xiao River and a large ditch in Neihuang, the accumulated water in all eleven depressions in the county can be drained. The 50-li long flooded land on both sides of the Xiao River can also be spared from flooding, rescuing a total of 1,500 acres of land, of which about 1,000 acres have now been planted with autumn seedlings. After this water management effort, 1,026 acres of land in Shanghe and Zhaocunpo, and 529 acres of land in Qingfeng can be spared from flooding.
    [Taihang Electric] The counties along the Zhang River, Dan River, and other rivers in Taihang are rushing to block breaches, rescue seedlings, and replant. Zhangnan (newly established county), which suffered the most severe flooding, had eighteen breaches in the Zhang River. The county party committee's secretary and deputy secretary, along with the deputy county head and all cadres from the sixth and seventh districts, immediately mobilized after the rain stopped on the 22nd, personally leading and organizing the masses to block the breaches. The Fifth Special Commissioner's Office also sent special personnel to assist. The sixth and seventh districts have now blocked three breaches, and on the 23rd, they mobilized all the masses to repair dikes and build dams. The masses who were isolated by the water in the river and on the rooftops have been rescued by boats. Zhao Zhenming, director of the Xinxiang County Armed Forces Committee, and District Chief Li, undeterred by hardship and danger, discovered a breach in the Dan River on the 22nd, with more than ten acres flooded. That night, they braved the rain and waded through the water to reach Sanwei Camp and Maying Bridge to conduct reconnaissance and organize the masses to block the breach, saving more than 20,000 acres of farmland. As a result, the morale of the masses has been transformed, and their confidence in overcoming the flood has greatly increased. Affected by this, the men and women of Gouxi Village also spontaneously organized to block two breaches that were six to seven zhang wide. The government is now continuing to investigate the disaster situation, organizing the masses to replant autumn vegetables and other crops, and issuing two million in loans to help the masses purchase seeds. Cadres in the fourth district of Wuzhi County led the masses, using the method of digging channels to divert water into the river. More than 300 acres in Geng Village were flooded, and more than 100 acres have been revived using this method. The Jiaozuo County Party Committee also issued an emergency instruction, calling on cadres and party members to wholeheartedly lead the masses to rescue seedlings and replant, putting forward the slogan "Save one acre is one acre, plant one piece when the water recedes." The armed forces have also taken the initiative to launch attacks and fully cover the masses in this production struggle. Cadres in the seventh district of She County personally went to the disaster-stricken villages to mobilize and persuade the masses, breaking the pessimistic mood. Dagang and other four villages have replanted more than 400 acres in four days. Various places are continuing to fight against the flood.

    【冀鲁豫电】八专区境内各河常年失修多呈淤塞，千多顷良田连年遭受水淹。上月中旬开始，八专署抓紧农隙，领导群众挖河，现在除清丰外，各县已全部完工，计挖浚马颊河（南乐濮阳段）、潴龙河、硝河、沙河（南乐段）及内黄一条大沟、南乐段一区七条水沟，全长十二万二千六百五十公尺。用工十六万五千三百一十二个。内黄硝河与一道大沟挖浚后，全县十一个洼的积水可以排出。硝河两岸五十里长之被淹地亦可免于水患，共救出田地一千五百顷，现已有千顷左右种上秋苗。经过这次治水，尚和赵村坡一千零二十六顷田地，清丰五百二十九顷田地均可免于水淹。
    【太行电】太行沿漳河、丹河等各县正抢堵决口，救苗补种。遭受水灾最严重之漳南（新设县），漳河决口达十八处，该县县委正副书记与副县长、六、七区全体干部，于二十二日雨停后，立即出动，亲自领导组织群众前往抢堵。五专署亦派专人前往协助。现六、七区已堵口三处，二十三日即发动全部群众修堤打坝。被水隔在河中与屋顶的群众，已派船救出。新乡县武委会主任赵振明和李区长不畏艰险，于二十二日发现丹河决口，十余亩被淹没，当夜好冒雨涉水，到达三位营、马营桥，进行侦察，组织群众堵口，二万余亩田禾得救。由此群众情绪转变，战胜水灾信心大增。影响所及，沟西村男女亦自动组织起来，将六七丈宽的两个决口堵住。现政府继续侦察灾情，组织群众补种秋菜等外，并发放二百万贷款，帮助群众购买种籽。武陟四区干部领导群众，采用挑渠引水办法，将水引到河里。耿村被淹三百余亩，用此办法已救活百余亩。焦作县委亦发出紧急指示，号召干部与党员全力带领群众救苗补种。提出“救活一亩是一亩，水落一块种一块”的口号。武装部队并主动出击，全力掩护群众这一生产斗争，涉县七区干部亲自到被灾村庄动员说服群众，打破悲观情绪。大港等四村四天内已补种四百余亩。现各地正继续向水灾博斗。
