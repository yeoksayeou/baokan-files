　　Land Reform Completes Liberation of Productive Forces
    Northeast Farmers Actively Produce
  　Reclaiming Wasteland, Controlling Water, Applying Fertilizer, Increasing Hoeing, Bumper Harvests Expected
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th] After the basic completion of land reform in the Northeast Liberated Areas, enormous production achievements have been obtained in the countryside. This year's agricultural production was completed by overcoming natural disasters during spring plowing and summer hoeing. According to preliminary statistics from Songjiang, Hejiang, Longjiang, Nenjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, Liaoning, Andong, and other eight provinces and Harbin City, the sown area reached 11,365,324 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu). Farmers have begun to change their previous habits of not cultivating intensively or applying fertilizer. They have generally achieved applying more manure and fertilizer, and two hoeings and two "rounds" or two hoeings and three "rounds." Therefore, this year's crops are full and robust, exceeding previous years. Except for wheat, whose yield was reduced due to diseases such as wheat scab, a bumper harvest is expected for general autumn crops. Under the government's policies of rewarding wasteland reclamation, exempting the first year's full public grain, and providing loans for assistance, the cultivated area in various localities has been greatly expanded. According to statistics from Nenjiang, Liaobei, Songjiang, Hejiang, Liaoning, and Longjiang provinces, a total of 597,008 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed, exceeding the original plan of 489,600 hectares by 20.7 percent. The enthusiasm of the emancipated farmers for wasteland reclamation is extremely high. Some areas organized shock teams for wasteland reclamation before planting large fields; some villages and settlements, due to the lack of wasteland nearby, sent oxen teams to reclaim wasteland ten li away from the village. In Mudanjiang Province (now merged into Songjiang and Hejiang provinces), in addition to overcoming natural disasters and replanting and replenishing the original cultivated land, 37,783 hectares of wasteland were also added, expanding the cultivated area by 12 percent. After most of the cultivated land in Nenjiang Province suffered from floods, with the help of more than 10 million jin of grain and 800 million Northeast currency in loans from the provincial government, all 14 counties in the province also rushed to complete this year's production plan of 2.04 million hectares, exceeding last year's cultivated area by 200,000 hectares. In the marginal areas of Tieling, Xinmin, and Faku in Liaobei Province, which suffered various ravages and destructions from the Kuomintang bandit troops, with the vigorous assistance of our military and government, the original sown area of 17,600 hectares was increased to 184,300 hectares, an expansion of more than tenfold. In Xiuyan County, Southern Liaoning, in half a month, more than 2,500 hectares of wasteland and mountains were transformed into fertile fields. In addition, immigration and wasteland reclamation, and the opening of paddy fields have also increased compared to previous years. According to preliminary statistics from the above eight provinces, approximately 80,000 hectares of paddy fields have been newly opened. Large-scale water conservancy projects that have been completed in various provinces, such as the dike restoration in the Kailu section of the West Liao River in Liaobei, the digging of trenches and building of dams in Panshan and Tai'an counties in Southern Liaoning, the digging of trenches in Lalin and Shuangcheng counties in Songjiang, water control in various places in Longjiang and Nenjiang, and the construction of trenches for flood prevention in Haicheng and other places in Andong, have totaled 230,000 hectares of improved and eliminated flood-affected farmland.
    The above production achievements were first and foremost due to the completion of land reform, which destroyed the feudal and semi-feudal land system of exploitation, liberated rural productive forces, and greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers for labor. After millions of farmers obtained their own land, livestock, and other means of production for the first time, a large-scale production campaign involving all men, women, old and young in rural areas was launched. At the same time, based on the decentralized land ownership and management after the equal distribution of land, mutual aid groups were organized under the principles of voluntary participation, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange. This new production relationship ensured that 10 to 15 percent of farming households lacking labor in rural areas were able to cultivate land, improved the overall rural productivity, and guaranteed the bumper harvest of the first year's large-scale production campaign, giving the vast number of farmers confidence and a material foundation for building a prosperous life. In production, new labor disciplines have been established in various places, most vagrants have been reformed, and they have consciously participated in production. Secondly, the Northeast Political Committee promptly promulgated various policies to protect private property rights and develop production. Policies such as issuing land licenses, fairly and reasonably distributing burdens, and rewarding model laborers, as well as guaranteeing people's freedom to borrow, buy, sell, and save, have dispelled farmers' concerns about daring to get rich and have initially established the idea of getting rich through hard work and striving to produce to support the front lines. Thirdly, it lies in the full leadership of the Party and government in various places, helping the masses solve production difficulties. This year, the Northeast Administrative Committee has successively issued agricultural loans (including loans for draft animals, immigration, water conservancy, and special crops) of 16.1 billion yuan; helped various provinces purchase and allocate a large number of draft animals and provided a large number of grain seeds and feed. A total of more than 36,000 cattle and horses, 7 million jin of rice seeds, 10.38 million jin of buckwheat, corn, millet, etc., 30.2 million jin of bean cake, and 500,900 cc of serum for cattle and horse epidemics and swine fever have been distributed in the past six months. Livestock epidemic prevention teams were dispatched to the countryside, reducing the mortality of farmers' draft animals. Some areas suffered severe spring droughts and various difficulties, but thanks to the strong support of the government, farmers' mutual aid in production and self-rescue, and the mobilization of more than 40 percent of women to participate in production, they overcame the difficulties and completed their tasks.
    Under the guidance of the principle of prioritizing agricultural production, rear-area organizations and troops in various places have vigorously built state-owned farms and have achieved great harvests. This year, the sown area of state-owned farms in the seven provinces of Songjiang, Longjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Liaobei, Liaoning, and Andong reached 146,654 hectares. Among them, Tongbei Farm operated by the Northeast Political Committee, the First Farm of Songjiang Province, the Water Conservancy Farm of Hejiang Province, and Xingkai Farm of Mudanjiang utilized tractors to reclaim wasteland, and in a short period of time, they opened up more than 5,500 hectares of paddy and dry land. When the tractor wasteland reclamation team of the Construction Department of the Nenjiang Provincial Government carried out a shock wasteland reclamation at the Xinfa Farm, up to eleven tractors were dispatched every day, and 2,400 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed within two weeks, demonstrating the enormous production effectiveness of agricultural mechanization. Various farms are also gradually creating experience in implementing enterprise management and reasonable profit sharing, so as to play a demonstrative role in collective labor and improved farming methods among farmers. In general, due to the development of agricultural production, various agencies can complete the self-sufficiency task of two months of grain and a whole year of vegetables, and some agencies can exceed this standard.
    The victorious completion of spring plowing and summer hoeing has not only laid the foundation for the plan to increase grain production by one million tons in 1948, but will also enable the Northeast Liberated Areas to obtain strong material strength in striving for the complete liberation of the Northeast.

　　土改完成解放了生产力
    东北农民积极生产
  　垦荒治水施肥增锄丰收在望
    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北解放区，农村在基本上完成土地改革后，获得巨大的生产成绩。今年的农业生产，是在战胜灾荒中完成春耕夏锄的。据松江、合江、龙江、嫩江、辽北、吉林、辽宁、安东等八省与哈尔滨市的初步统计，播种面积达一千一百三十六万五千三百二十四垧（每垧十亩）。农民已开始改变其以前不精耕细作不施肥的习惯，普遍做到了多上粪多施肥及两铲两“趟”或二铲三“趟”，因此今年农作物饱满茁壮，超过往年。除小麦因红疸等病害影响降低了产量外，一般秋田庄稼，丰收在望。在政府奖励开荒，免征第一年全部公粮，及贷款扶助等政策下，各地方的耕地面积大大扩充。据嫩江、辽北、松江、合江、辽宁、龙江等六省统计，共开荒五十九万七千零八垧，超过原订计划四十八万九千六百垧的百分之二十点七。翻身农民垦荒热情极高。有的地区在种大田前，即组织开荒小组突击开荒；有的村屯因附近没有荒地，而抽出牛犋离村十里外去开荒。牡丹江省（现该省已分别并入松江、合江两省）除战胜了灾荒，抢种和补种上了原有耕地外，亦增开了三万七千七百八十三垧荒地，扩大了耕地面积百分之十二。嫩江省大部耕地遭受水灾后，在省政府贷粮千余万斤及贷款八亿元东北币的帮助下，全省十四个县亦抢种完成今年二百零四万垧的生产计划，超过去年耕地面积二十万垧。辽北省铁岭、新民、法库等边缘区遭受国民党匪军的各种摧残和破坏，但在我军政大力帮助下，竟从原有播种面积一万七千六百垧，增加到了十八万四千三百垧，扩大超过十倍。辽南岫岩全县以半月时间，将两千五百多垧荒地和山岭变成了良田。此外，移民开荒、开水田等也均比往年增加，据上述八个省初步统计，已增开水田约八万垧。各省已完成之规模较大的水利工程，如辽北西辽河开鲁段之复堤，辽南盘山、台安两县的挖壕筑坝，松江拉林、双城等县的挖壕，龙江、嫩江各地的治水及安东海城等地的筑壕防水，总计改造和消除了水患的良田已达二十三万垧。
    以上生产成绩的获得，首先是由于土地改革的完成，摧毁了封建半封建剥削的土地制度，解放了农村生产力，大大提高了农民劳动的积极性。千百万农民第一次获得了属于自己的土地、牲口等生产资料后，即掀起了农村各阶层人民全体男女老幼的大生产运动。同时根据平分土地后土地分散、经营分散的情况，在自愿两利等价交换的原则下，组织起互助小组，这一新的生产关系，保证了农村中百分之十到百分之十五缺少劳动力的农户种上了土地，提高了整个农村生产力，保证了第一年大生产运动的丰收，使广大农民打下了兴家致富的信心和物质基础。生产中，各地已建立了新的劳动纪律，大部分游民已获得改造，自觉地参加了生产。其次是东北政委会又及时地颁布了保护财产私有权、发展生产的各种政策。如颁发土地执照、公平合理负担、奖励劳模等政策，并保障人民有借贷、买卖、储蓄等自由，使农民扫除了不敢发财致富的顾虑，初步树立了勤劳致富和努力生产支援前线的思想。再次则在于各地党和政府的全力领导，帮助群众解决了生产困难。东北行政委员会今年曾先后发放农业贷款（包括耕畜、移民、水利和特种作物等贷款）一百六十一亿元；帮助各省购买和调剂了大批耕畜并贷给大批粮食种子与马料。计有牛马三万六千余头，稻籽七百万斤，荞麦、苞米、稷子等一千零三十八万斤，豆饼三千零二十万斤，半年来发出了牛、马疫及猪瘟等血清共五十万零九千西西。更分派家畜防疫组下乡，减少了农民耕畜的死亡。有些地区曾遭受严重的春荒和各种困难，但由于政府大力扶助，农民拨工互助生产自救及发动了百分之四十以上妇女参加生产，都克服困难完成了任务。
    各地后方机关部队在贯彻农业生产为主的方针下，大力建设公营农场，已获得了巨大的收获。松江、龙江、合江嫩江、辽北、辽宁、安东七省今年公营农场的播种面积达十四万六千六百五十四垧。其中东北政委会经营的通北农场、松江省营第一农场、合江省营水利农场、牡丹江兴凯农场等运用拖拉机开荒，短期内即开垦水旱田五千五百余垧。嫩江省府建设厅拖拉机开荒大队在新发农场突击垦荒时，每天出动拖拉机至十一架，两周内即开荒二千四百垧，显示了农业机械化的巨大生产效力。各地农场在实行企业管理、合理分红上，也正逐渐创造经验，以便在农民中发挥集体劳动与改良农作法的示范作用。一般机关因农业生产的开展，均可完成两个月粮食和全年蔬菜的自给任务，有的机关尚可超过此标准。
    春耕夏锄的胜利完成，不但给一九四八年增产粮食一百万吨的计划奠定了基础，并将使东北解放区在争取全部解放东北中获得雄厚的物质力量。
