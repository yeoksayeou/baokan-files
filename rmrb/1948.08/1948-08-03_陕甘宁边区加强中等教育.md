Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is actively preparing to restore and strengthen secondary school education in both old and new areas. The middle schools in various districts of the old areas, which were converted into cadre schools last year, will be restored after autumn. The Suide and Mizhi Middle Schools are planning to enroll 600 students. Yan'an University and its affiliated middle school, which are still operating as usual, each have more than 300 students and plan to expand to 1,000. The faculty of each middle school will also be greatly expanded.

Before the War of Liberation, the old areas had seven middle schools with more than 2,300 students. After rent reduction and interest reduction, and land reform, the children of the laboring masses accounted for the vast majority of the students. Students from landlord and wealthy peasant families have also undergone significant ideological transformation. Since 1940, the middle schools have trained more than 6,000 middle school students who have participated in various jobs. More than 100 teachers and students from Xingzhi Middle School even joined the army last year during the war to participate in medical care and nursing, achieving remarkable results. After November last year, due to war, famine, and the need to prepare a large number of cadres for the new areas, the middle schools in various districts were converted into cadre schools, and district, township, and village cadres were drawn for short-term training to meet the needs of developing work in the new areas. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the entire region have been gradually wiped out, and the newly liberated areas have been expanded greatly. The old areas have entered a period of recovery and development of various constructions, so the middle schools in various districts are preparing to restore.

    陕甘宁边区加强中等教育
    【新华社西北三十日电】陕甘宁边区刻正积极准备恢复与加强新老区中等学校教育。去年改为干部学校的老区各分区中学校，将于秋后恢复。绥德、米脂中学并已预定招收学生六百人。现仍照常开学的延安大学及附属中学，各有学生三百余人，计划扩大至一千人，各中学教员亦将大量扩充。
    在解放战争前，老区原有七个中学校，学生二千三百余人。经过减租减息、土地改革后，学生中劳动群众子弟已占绝大多数。地富家庭出身的学生在思想上也得到了很大改造。自一九四○年起各中学即培养出参加各种工作的中学生有六千余名。行知中学教员学生百余人并于去年战争中随军参加医疗护理工作，成绩卓著。去年十一月后，因战争、灾荒以及为了大量准备新区干部，曾将各分区中学改为干部学校，抽调区、乡、村干部进行短期训练，以适应开展新区工作之需要。现全区蒋匪次第肃清，并扩大了大新解放区，老区已转入恢复与发展各项建设时期，故各分区中学均筹备恢复中。
