Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th—Han Yousan, a supervisor at the Northeast Shipyard, was sentenced by the Harbin Special City Court on July 23rd to three months in prison for illegally arresting and torturing workers. Han is from Shandong and a Communist Party member. He currently serves as a supervisor at the Northeast Navigation Bureau Shipyard. He committed bureaucratic errors in administrative management and lacked education of his fellow workers on a daily basis. On June 18th, six dozen saw blades were lost within the shipyard. Without a thorough investigation, Han privately detained three workers, including Liu Baoquan, and subjected Liu Baoquan to torture. Liu and the others all denied the theft. This matter was discovered by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, immediately drawing serious attention from the Municipal Government, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Political Committee, the Transportation Committee, and other relevant parties. A workers' meeting was held on June 22nd at the shipyard, where Wu Zhili, the Director of the Navigation Bureau, announced Han Yousan's errors and gave him a punishment. The Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party also determined to give Han a disciplinary action within the Party for violating the government's laws protecting human rights and the Party's policies and undermining Party discipline. At the same time, the Harbin Municipal Public Security Bureau filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. The Harbin Municipal Court accepted the case and, after verifying the facts, held a hearing and pronounced the sentence at 2:00 PM on July 23rd. Representatives from various municipal organs, trade unions, public and private enterprises, and mass organizations were sent to attend the hearing. After listing the facts, President Wang Huaian announced: "The defendant violated Article 2 of the Municipal Government's Order on the Protection of Human Rights issued on April 13th of the 37th year of the Republic of China and is sentenced to three months in prison." Han Yousan then made a public self-criticism and expressed his determination to repent. The attendees unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for this verdict by the democratic government, which maintained government orders and protected the democratic rights of the people.

Another news item: The Northeast Daily published an editorial on the handling of the Han Yousan case, pointing out that the government's handling was completely necessary and correct. In a people's city, a good revolutionary order must be consolidated to protect the democratic interests of the people. To establish such an order, it is necessary to establish the rule of law and spirit of the New Democratic regime, and it is necessary to rectify discipline and oppose all undisciplined and anarchic states. Because administrative power belongs to the people, the policies and laws it formulates concentrate and represent the interests of the people and the revolution. Every citizen has the responsibility to abide by and defend the law, and organs and groups should become models for implementing government policies and laws. In the future, all anarchic and undisciplined behaviors that ignore government laws and disrupt revolutionary order must be handled like the Han Yousan case, adhering to the principles of legislation and law enforcement to implement the spirit of the rule of law and consolidate democratic order. The editorial also stated: "All administrative management personnel in public enterprises and organ production units should use the Han Yousan incident as a lesson to educate cadres and check and improve the management methods and style of their enterprises. Because in public enterprises, the administrative management personnel and workers only have different divisions of labor in their work positions, and their political status is equal. In order to ensure the completion of production tasks, public enterprises must have a high degree of concentration in their organization, but this concentration is achieved on the basis of a high degree of democracy. If the management cadres are not good at relying on the masses and taking the mass line to carry out their tasks, but only rely on administrative orders and use bureaucratic means to suppress democracy when carrying out their tasks, their leadership will be divorced from the masses, which is completely inconsistent with the management policy of New Democratic public enterprises. Cadres with such bad styles will not be able to run any factory well, their work will not stand the test of inspection, and the consequences will be harmful to the Party's cause. The root cause of Han Yousan's mistake is that he still does not understand the management policies and methods of public enterprises, and he adopted an erroneous method that no revolutionary worker should have and cannot tolerate."

　　东北造船所监理韩友三
    违法打人被判徒刑
  　东北日报号召树立法治精神
    【新华社东北十一日电】哈尔滨特别市法院于七月二十三日判处私自逮捕与拷打工人之东北造船所监理韩友三三个月徒刑。韩系山东人，共产党员，现任东北航务局造船所监理，在行政管理上犯官僚主义错误，平日对工友缺乏教育。六月十八日所内遗失锯条六打，韩未经切实调查，即私自拘禁刘保全等三工人，并刑讯刘保全。刘等一致不承认偷窃。事为市职工总会发觉，当即引起市政府、职工会、政委会交通委员会等有关方面的严重注意，当于六月二十二日假造船所召开职工大会，由航务局长吴志立宣布韩友三的错误并给以处分。中共东北局亦以韩违反政府保障人权法令和党的政策与破坏党的纪律，决定在党内给以处分。同时哈市公安总局则依法提起公诉，经哈市法院受理并讯明属实，于七月二十三日下午二时开庭宣判。全市各机关，职工会，公私企业及群众团体，均派代表前往旁听。院长王怀安于列举事实经过后，宣布：“被告触犯市府民国三十七年四月十三日保障人权令第二条之规定，判处徒刑三个月”。继由韩友三当众反省，并表示决心悔过。旁听者对民主政府此种维护政令、保障人民民主权利之判决，一致表示热诚拥护。
    另息：东北日报对韩友三案件的处理，特发表社论，指出：政府这一处理完全必要和正确。在人民城市中，必须巩固良好的革命秩序，以保护人民的民主利益。要建立这样的一种秩序，就必须树立新民主主义政权的法治制度与法治精神，就必须整顿纪律，反对一切无纪律无政府的状态。因行政权是人民的，其所制定的政策与法令是集中和代表人民和革命的利益，每个公民都有守法卫法的责任，机关团体更应成为执行政府政策法令的模范。今后一切忽视政府法令，破坏革命秩序的无政府无纪律的行为，必须象这次处理韩友三案件一样，本立法执法的原则，以贯彻法治精神，巩固民主秩序。社论并称：“一切公营企业及机关生产单位的行政管理人员，应以韩友三事件的教训来教育干部，和检查改进本企业的管理方法与作风。因为在公营企业里，行政管理人员与工人之间只是工作职务的分工不同，政治地位是平等的。公营企业为保证生产任务的完成，组织上要有高度的集中，但这种集中是建立在高度的民主基础上来实现的。假如管理干部，不善于依靠群众，走群众路线去执行任务，而只依靠行政命令，压制民主的官僚主义去执行任务时，它的领导就与群众脱节，这是完全不符合新民主主义公营企业的管理方针的。具有这种恶劣作风的干部，是不会办好任何工厂的，他的工作必定经不起检查和考验，他的后果是损害党的事业。韩友三之错误根源，也就是因为他还不懂得公营企业的管理方针与方法，他采取了一个革命工作人员绝不应有的和不可容忍的错误手段。”
