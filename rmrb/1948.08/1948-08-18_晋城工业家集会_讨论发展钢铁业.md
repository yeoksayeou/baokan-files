　　【Taiyue Telegram】Industrial capitalists and factory managers in Jincheng City gathered to discuss how to develop Jincheng's industry. More than 30 representatives from industries such as steel, leather, paper making, chemicals, printing, and knitting attended. First, Cui Weiqin and Jin Hongrui, who had attended the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, introduced the conference's situation and various resolutions. Then, the discussion turned to the issues at hand. Everyone unanimously agreed to first restore and develop Jincheng's steel production. Jincheng is a famous coal and iron producing area. Before the war, there were more than 1,500 hand-operated steel smelting furnaces, on which nearly 10,000 people depended for a living. There were also more than 60 large iron furnaces, each of which could support more than 1,000 people. However, after long-term destruction by the enemy and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, many skilled workers scattered to find a way to make a living or returned home to farm (mostly people from Jiyuan, Meng County, and Qinyuan). The primary issue now is to solve the difficulties of the skilled workers. Everyone requested that the government help hire some technical talents in order to conduct research and gradually switch to using machines. They hoped to restore the past generators. Some suggestions for improvement were also put forward regarding labor-capital relations. Manager Li of Tongji Factory said: "In the past, union cadres proposed that workers' wages should be three to six dou of rice per month, and also a four-six profit sharing (labor 40%, capital 60%), which left me with no surplus. In the future, we should study and decide together." Jin Hongrui explained in detail the resolutions of the Industry and Commerce Conference regarding wages, labor-capital relations, and apprenticeship relations. Everyone supported them and said, "Now things are good. We can rationally solve these problems and develop production."

　　晋城工业家集会
  　讨论发展钢铁业
    【太岳电】晋城市工业资本家及工厂经理集会，讨论如何发展晋城工业的问题。到有钢铁、皮革、造纸、化学、印刷、针织等各行业代表三十余。首由曾出席华北工商会议的崔维勤、靳鸿瑞二人介绍会议情形及各种决议、随即转入讨论。大家一致同意首先恢复与发展晋城的钢铁生产。晋城是著名的煤铁产区，战前有手工钢铁碎货炉一千五百多盘，将近一万人赖以为生，还有大铁炉六十多盘，每盘能养活千余人。唯经敌人及蒋匪长期破坏，许多技术工人都四散谋生，或回家务农（大部为济源、孟县、沁源人），现在首要问题是解决技术工人的困难。大家要求政府帮助聘请一些技术人材，以便进行研究，逐渐改用机器。希望能把过去的发电机恢复。关于劳资关系也提出一些改进的意见，同记工厂李经理说：“过去工会干部曾给我提出工人待遇每月是三斗米到六斗米，还要按四六分红（劳四资六），这样下来我就没余剩了，今后该共同研究决定才好。”靳鸿瑞把工商会议关于工资、劳资关系、师徒关系等决议，详细解释了一番，大家都很拥护，都说：“现在好了，能合理解决这些问题，能发展生产了。”
