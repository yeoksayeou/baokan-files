　　Educational Work is a Glorious Post
    Comrade Editor:
    The Yucheng First District held a joint meeting of all district principals and teachers on June 6th to study the left-leaning adventurism in schools from last winter to the present. During the discussion, most teachers were of the opinion that they would rather go home to farm and be peasants than be teachers. This is mainly due to the following points: the leadership does not value teachers, and village work often changes, but teachers are always isolated, becoming "unsupported," "unmanaged," and "dirty drain." How can this improve?
    During the filling of Xiliu Village, Comrade Shen Xiaotu of the work team said: "What future is there in being a teacher, what are you doing that for!" Zheng Shaojun (a teacher in Xiliu) saw him say this with his own eyes and was very pessimistic, thinking that there was no future in being a teacher and that he had no interest in his work, but he did not dare to say anything. "It's better to say one less word than one more." Is this the fate of teachers? At the same time, district and village cadres openly criticize intellectuals, which teachers cannot accept, and they carry the ideological burden of being inferior to peasants. How should this be resolved?
    In addition, can teachers join the farmers' association? The 25th issue of New Masses, page 4, states that teachers can also not participate in the farmers' association. Does this mean they cannot participate in the farmers' association in their place of work, or can they not participate in the farmers' association in their place of origin? Or do they have no right to participate at all? Can they join the Communist Party organization? What are the conditions?
    Can teachers and freelancers quit their jobs? Please answer separately, Editor!
    (Asked by teachers Zhi Xiu, Yan Ting, Shuang Gui, Dong Zhi, Si Ke, Shui Long, etc. of Huangchi School District, Yucheng)
    Answer: We have studied your questions together with the Department of Education, and our reply is as follows:
    Under the leadership of the democratic government, any work is to serve the people and is a glorious post. As long as you work diligently, there is a future. At present, our North China Liberated Area is further deepening the construction of a new democratic country, and education work is also an important part of this construction and should not be underestimated. The mental labor of intellectuals engaged in education also makes a certain contribution to the country, and they should not be underestimated or excluded but should be respected and cared for. Especially today, when there is a shortage of teachers, existing teachers should be further trained and educated. The views expressed in the letter that some people despise intellectuals and believe that there is no future in doing educational work are all erroneous understandings and statements. Your county has held meetings to examine the left-leaning errors in past education, and work will definitely improve in the future. Some individuals may have some misconceptions, which should be explained to them, and they should not be pessimistic and disappointed as a result, which would affect their work. As for the leadership's insufficient care for you or the imperfect organization, you should also take a proactive and responsible attitude and make specific suggestions to the leadership in a timely manner to promote the work. Feeling "unmanaged" and "unsupported" will not solve the problem. Going home to be a farmer is only a temporary complaint and is not a responsible and problem-solving attitude towards work. We hope that you will remove all ideological burdens, establish a high sense of career in education, and work hard to do your job well.
    Teachers can participate in the Teachers' Union. The Farmers' Association is an organization for farmers, and teachers should naturally not participate. However, if their family is in the countryside and meets the conditions for joining the Farmers' Association, they can participate. Whether they can join the Communist Party depends on their own performance. According to the Party Constitution, those who meet the conditions for joining the Party can participate.
    Teachers are freelancers and have the freedom to choose their profession.　　　　　——Editor

### 教育工作是光荣的岗位

专栏：询问与答复

　　教育工作是光荣的岗位
    编辑同志：
    潞城一区于六月六号召开全区联合校长教员会议，研究去冬到现在学校的左倾冒险主义。在讨论时，大部分教员都存在着宁愿回家种地当农民，不愿担任教员，这主要有以下几点：领导上不重视教员，村里工作常有变动，可是教员总孤立在一旁，成了“无依靠”“没人管”“脏水谷”这怎能进步呢？
    西流村填补时，工作组申小秃同志说：“当教员有些什前途，干那做什哩！”当时有郑绍均（西流教员）亲眼看见他这样说，非常悲观，认为当教员没前途，对工作没兴趣，又不敢吭声。“多一言不如少一句”。这就是教员的下场吗？同时区村干部张口就说知识分子长短，教员们接受不下去，背了个不如当农民的思想包袱，这该如何解决？
    另外教员是否能加入农会？新大众二十五期第四版登载教员也可以不参加农会，是不能参加岗位村农会呢？还是原籍贯村也不能参加？还是根本没参加的权利？是否能加入共产党组织？条件是什么？
    教员、自由职业者，是否能不干？请编者分别答复！
    （潞城黄池学区教员志秀、延廷、双贵、东只、思科、水龙等问）
    答：你们的问题，我们已与教育厅共同研究，答复如下：
    在民主政府领导下，从事任何工作都是为人民服务，都是光荣的岗位，只要认真工作都是有前途的。目前我华北解放区正在进一步深入新民主主义国家建设工作，教育工作同样也是重要的建设工作之一，决不应轻视。从事教育工作的知识分子，其脑力劳动对国家也是有一定贡献的，不但不应轻视排斥而应尊重爱护。特别在今天，师资缺乏，对于现有教员更应加紧培养教育。来信中所提出的某些轻视知识分子，认为做教育工作没前途，都是些错误认识与说法。你们县已开会检查过去教育中的左倾错误，今后工作一定会有改进，个别人有些错误认识，应向其解释，不应因而悲观失望影响工作。至于领导上对你们照顾不够或机构不健全等，也应以积极负责的态度，及时向领导上作具体建议，以便推进工作。从自觉得“没人管”“无依靠”是不能解决问题的，能回家当农民只是一时的牢骚，不是对工作负责和解决问题的态度，希望你们去掉一切思想包袱，树立对教育工作的高度的事业心，努力做好自己工作。
    教员可以参加教联会，农会是农民的组织，教员自然不应参加，但其家庭在乡村者，够入农会条件则可以参加；能否加入共产党，则应看其本人表现如何，按党章规定合乎入党条件的，就可以参加。
    教员是自由职业者，其本人有选择职业自由。　　　　　——编者
