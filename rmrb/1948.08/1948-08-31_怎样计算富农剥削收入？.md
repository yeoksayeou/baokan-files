　　How to Calculate Exploitation Income of Rich Peasants?
    To the Editors:
    We encountered a problem of class designation while studying land reform policies, please answer:
    Anyone whose exploitation exceeds 25% is considered a rich peasant, but how should this 25% be calculated? For example, a family with 50 mu of land, an annual income of 40 shi of grain, six family members, two of whom participate in the main labor, and one hired long-term laborer, plus 5 shi of income from spinning and 2 shi of income from lending money at interest. What is the class status of this family? How should the amount of exploitation be calculated?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hu Yucheng, Tao Renzhen, North China Party School

    △Answer: The so-called "exploitation exceeding 25% means a rich peasant" refers to a peasant whose feudal exploitation income exceeds 25%, or one-quarter, of their total income and who has maintained this way of life for three consecutive years, thus fulfilling the conditions of a rich peasant. The so-called total income here refers to the sum of all kinds of income, including agricultural and sideline income. Feudal exploitation income, in the context of hired labor, refers to the surplus value of the hired worker's primary and secondary products after deducting the hired worker's wages, food, and other production costs. In the context of land leasing, it refers to rent. In the context of debt relations, it refers to usury. However, in the actual calculation of exploitation income from hired labor, for the sake of convenience, generally only the wages and food of the hired worker are deducted, and not the consumption of other constant capital such as seeds and fertilizers. Regarding the example you cited: the total income of this family is 47 shi. Although the exploitation income from the hired laborer cannot be accurately calculated, under normal circumstances, if the wages and food paid to the hired laborer by this family are sufficient to maintain their life, then as long as the employer's labor force is equal in quantity and quality, its exploitation income is generally one-quarter of the total income. This family has twice the labor force of the hired laborer, and the other exploitation income does not exceed one-eighth of its total income, so this family should be a wealthy middle peasant with slight exploitation, rather than a rich peasant. However, if the land occupied by the household exceeds the average owned by general middle peasants by one time or more than one time but less than two times, then the one-quarter exploitation limit should be reduced by one-half.

　　怎样计算富农剥削收入？
    编辑同志：
    我们在学习土改政策中遇到一个划成份问题，请予解答：
    凡剥削超过百分之二十五以上就算富农，但这百分之二十五应如何计算法？如一家五十亩地，每年收入四十石粮食，六口人，家里有两人参加主要劳动，另外雇长工一人，另外纺纱收入五石、放债收入二石，象这家是什么成份？如何计算剥削量？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　华北党校胡雨成、陶任珍
    △答：所谓“剥削超过百分之二十五即是富农”，是指一个农民的封建剥削收入超过其总收入的百分之二十五即四分之一并连续此种生活满三年者即构成富农条件，这里所谓总收入是指包括农副业在内的各种收入的总和，封建性的剥削收入，在雇工关系上，是指雇工正副生产物在扣除雇工的工资吃粮和雇工在生产中所消费的其他成本以后的剩余价值，在出租土地方面指地租，在债权关系上指高利贷。但在实际计算雇工的剥削收入时，为便利计，一般只扣除雇工的工资吃粮，而不扣除其他种籽肥料等不变资本的消耗。就你所举例子说：这家的总收入共四十七石。对雇工的剥削收入虽不能精确计算，但一般情况下，如果这家付给雇工的工资吃粮足以维持其生活，则只要雇主的劳动力在数量上和质量上相等时，其剥削收入一般为总收入的四分之一。这家劳力多于雇工劳力一倍，另外的剥削收入又不超过其总收入八分之一，故这家应是有轻微剥削的富裕中农，而非富农。但如果该户所占有的土地超过一般中农平均所有一倍或一倍以上二倍以下，则四分之一的剥削限度应降低二分之一。
