　　Beida Agricultural College Uses Waste Sugar to Make Alcohol
[This newspaper's report] The Director of Beida Agricultural College, Xu Weiying, and the Director of the Chemistry Laboratory, Yue Liangcai, led all the students of the sugar-making class and the chemistry class of the college in an experiment to use waste sugar, a by-product of the sugar industry, to produce alcohol, which has been successful. More than 500 catties of finished products have now been produced. Every 100 catties of waste sugar can produce more than 40 catties of alcohol with a yield of 70 percent. Anhydrous alcohol and ordinary alcoholic beverages can also be produced. This year, the sugar farmers at the college's various work stations have planted more than 500 mu of sugar beets, which can yield more than 150,000 catties of waste sugar, which can be used to produce more than 50,000 catties of alcohol, saving a lot of grain.
