　　Negligence in Grain Transportation Results in Losses
  　Supply Bureau Investigates and Deals with the Matter
    Comrade Editor:
    Regarding the criticism and suggestion in the August 15th newspaper about the Hengshui Grain Bureau of the Jizhong District not properly storing public grain, resulting in damage, this was grain already transferred to the Border Region Supply Bureau by the Jizhong Administrative Office. This batch of grain totaled over 600,000 jin (eleven railcars). At the time, it was not covered properly and was rained on for a day before being covered with mats and tarpaulins. It took thirteen days to transport it to the unloading point, and it was not turned over for sun drying in between. As a result, 1,600 sacks rotted and over 6,000 jin of grain spoiled. This failure to prepare before the rain and failure to take timely action after the rain, resulting in the loss of property obtained through the people's sweat and blood, is indeed a major error. In addition to transferring An Qianmin, the Deputy Section Chief who was sent to Hengshui to collect the grain, back for public criticism, we will report the detailed circumstances to the Border Region Government to request punishment. We also apologize to the people and express our gratitude and apologies to the Hengshui Hongtai Freight Station and the Jizhong Grain Bureau!

　　运粮失职受到损失
  　供应局已检查处理
    编辑同志：
    八月十五号报载，冀中区住衡水粮食局保管公粮不好，致遭损坏的批评建议，是冀中行署已拨交边区供应局的粮食，这批粮食共数六十余万斤（十一个车皮）。当时没盖好，下雨淋了一天，才用席子和雨布掩盖。延至运到卸粮地点，中间用时十三天，也没有倒晒。结果腐烂了口袋一千六百条，坏了谷子六千多斤。这种雨前不做准备，雨淋后又不及时处理，致使人民血汗换来之财产，遭此损失，的确错误很大，本局除将派赴衡水收粮之副科长安谦民，调回进行当众批评，将详细情形，报告边府请求处分外，并向人民请罪及衡水宏泰货栈、冀中粮食局致谢致歉！
