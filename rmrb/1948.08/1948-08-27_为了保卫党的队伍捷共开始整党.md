　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 24th.  Electone News Agency reported: The Central Executive Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party passed a resolution on the 15th: A large-scale review of party members will begin on October 1st. All levels of party members must undergo review to see if they are serving the people. The Executive Committee's decision declared: "Parasitic elements within the party must be purged," and pointed out that the significance of the review "is not to expel a large number of party members, but to educate all party members to defend the party ranks." The decision pointed out: The Communist Party is the largest party in the country and is responsible for organizing the country based on socialism. "Therefore, the task of organizations at all levels is to understand the Party's policies, resolutely follow the Party's principles, and lead party members to work responsibly." Furthermore, the Central Party School of the Czechoslovak Communist Party began on the 2nd of this month. The study period is one year and will train cadres who can assume responsible positions for the Czechoslovak Communist Party, which has two million members. In addition to the Central Party School, the Czechoslovak Communist Party is also running many short-term training courses.
