    (Jizhong Electricity) (Late Arrival) Our army recovered Xincheng City, the old nest of the Wang Fenggang bandit gang. The troops entering the city and the democratic government conscientiously implemented the city's policies. After the liberation of the city, a temporary urban management committee was first established, and various situations were investigated and studied, and then work began. At first, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet staff were afraid that we would arrest them; the families of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers were afraid that we would ask them for their people and confiscate their property; the fleeing landlords were afraid that we would send them back to their original villages for processing; and the local landlords were afraid of being liquidated. The management committee explained the lenient policy to these different objects, explaining the methods of dealing with various personnel. All puppet civil servants were not arrested, and two employees of the post office were still retained to work in the post office, and 200 kilograms of corn were allocated to them to take care of their lives, and they were very moved. Some of the families of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers ran away, so their property was sealed up or entrusted to someone to take care of it. The urban masses reflected: "I have never seen such a good army." Therefore, the people who had run away slowly came back. The management committee repeatedly explained the democratic government's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, issued a proclamation, and also held a forum with representatives of 83 merchants to explain the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies in more detail. The merchants unanimously reflected: "That's much better!" On the spot, the merchants elected representatives and established a chamber of commerce. The next day, most of the stores opened. The city's poor people, small vendors, and small clerks in the organs gradually approached us. They urgently demanded food and fuel and hoped to restore the market as soon as possible to make a living. According to these demands of the masses, the management committee distributed more than 30,000 kilograms of relief grain.

    没见过这么好的军队
  　新城群众欢迎我军
    【冀中电】（迟到）我军收复王匪凤岗的老巢新城城，入城部队及民主政府，认真执行城市政策。该城解放后，首先建立了城市临时管理委员会，调查研究了各种情况，随后就开始工作。起初，蒋伪工作人员怕我们抓捕；蒋伪军家属怕我们向他要人，没收财产；逃亡地主怕我们送原村处理；本地地主怕清算。管委会对这些不同对象，分别解释了宽大政策，说明对各种人员的处理办法。对伪公务人员一律不加逮捕，邮局两个职员仍留邮局工作，并拨给他们二百斤玉米照顾生活，他们非常感动。有些蒋伪军家属跑了，就把他们的财产用封条封好，或托人替他看管。城市群众反映：“可没见过这么好的军队。”因此已跑出去的人，也慢慢回来了。管委会再三讲解民主政府保护和发展工商业的政策，发了布告，同时并召开了八十三家商民代表的座谈会，更详细的讲明了民主政府的工商业政策。商人一致反映说：“这么着就好多啦！”当场商人们选出代表，成立了商会。第二天，各商店大部开了门。城里贫民、小摊贩、机关的小职员等，都渐渐接近我们了。他们迫切要求吃的、烧的，希望能早日恢复集市，谋求生活。管理委员会根据群众这些要求，发放了救济粮食三万多斤。
