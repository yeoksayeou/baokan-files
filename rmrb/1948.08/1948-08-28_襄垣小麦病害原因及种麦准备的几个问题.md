　　Causes of Wheat Diseases in Xiangyuan and Several Issues in Preparing for Wheat Planting

    I. The Disease Situation

    This summer, Xiangyuan wheat suffered various disasters (wind, hail, disease) totaling more than 57,900 mu, resulting in a reduction of more than 20,000 shi. The first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts (out of seven districts in the county; statistics for the third and seventh are not included) planted a total of 158,400 mu of wheat, with more than 39,000 mu affected by wheat rust and black rust, accounting for 24.6% of the wheat area. In the sixth district, 21 villages planted a total of 36,600 mu of wheat land, with more than 10,900 mu affected by yellow and black rust, accounting for 29.9% of the wheat area. In the Beiyadi natural village of the Majia Dongling administrative village in the fourth district, 1,404 mu of wheat land were planted, with 441 mu affected by yellow rust and 746 mu affected by black rust. The total disease affected area accounted for 84.6% of the wheat area. The yield reduction due to disease is generally around three to four dou per mu (this year, wheat land in Xiangyuan that was not affected by disease yielded an average of five dou per mu, while affected land averaged 1.5 dou), with some severely affected areas yielding less than one dou per mu or no harvest at all. Generally, the quality of diseased wheat grains is reduced, resulting in less flour production.

    II. Reasons for the Development of Diseases

    Based on materials obtained during the summer harvest, the reasons for the development of yellow and black rust diseases in Xiangyuan wheat this year, in addition to the parasitic transmission of the diseases themselves and natural causes such as the relatively high rainfall and humidity before the wheat harvest this year, which were conducive to disease development, there are also the following reasons in terms of cultivation: (1) When Xiangyuan planted wheat last autumn, it coincided with the war effort, and there was a shortage of labor and livestock, resulting in some wheat land not being planted in time (wheat planting in Xiangyuan is generally around the White Dew solar term), and the planting was too late. Some were planted during rainy days with excessively wet soil. These wheat lands generally matured later this spring and were severely affected by disease. For example, in Beiyadi village, the main crop wheat covered 1,170 mu, with 82% affected by disease; the replanted wheat covered 234 mu, with 95% affected by disease. Cui Shouyi planted 2.17 mu of red wheat, with an expected yield of six dou per mu, but due to late planting last autumn, the disease was severe this spring, and he only harvested a total of 1.5 dou. Zhao Zhengxi planted nine mu of wheat. He planted in three stages last autumn. The first stage (around the White Dew solar term) was not affected by disease and yielded well; the second stage was planted during rain, the soil was too wet, and the wheat seeds were planted too deep, resulting in severe black rust this spring; the third stage was planted late and also developed black rust this year. Li Huangma and Zhao Jinkui of Shuiniangou Village in the fifth district jointly cultivated a piece of land. Li Huangma planted 2.7 mu of wheat and planted it at White Dew, this summer he harvested two shi and five dou of wheat, averaging nine dou and two sheng per mu; Zhao Jinkui planted 2.4 mu of wheat, planted more than half a month after White Dew, and the black rust was severe this spring. He harvested a total of seven dou and five sheng, averaging only three dou and one sheng per mu. (2) Zhao Sanhai of Xingmin Village in the fifth district planted three plots of 169 wheat last autumn, with three types of terrain and three types of fertilizer, resulting in three types of harvest this year. The first type was 1.3 mu of highland, with an expected yield of 7.5 dou per mu. He applied smoked fertilizer last autumn, and this summer he harvested 7.1 dou of wheat per mu, exceeding the expected yield by one sheng per mu. The second type was 2.4 mu of flat land, with an expected yield of one shi and five dou per mu. He applied mixed manure last autumn, and this summer he harvested an average of 8.3 dou of wheat per mu, 2.3 dou per mu lower than the expected yield. The third type was 1.2 mu of ditch land, with an expected yield of one shi and 2.5 dou per mu. He applied wheat rust and wheat bran fertilizer last autumn, and the disease was severe this summer, yielding less than five dou per mu, 7.5 dou per mu lower than the expected yield. This illustrates the impact of land terrain and fertilization. (3) The impact of wheat seeds. The 169 wheat generally had yellow straw this year, and the wheat grains were thin and produced little flour. Local wheat seeds also have yellow rust. From the wheat disease situation in Xiangyuan this summer, the area affected by black rust is larger than the area affected by yellow rust.

    The county has experienced continuous occurrences of yellow and black rust for several years. Zhao Jinyou, the director of superior production, saw black rust disease in wheat fields in the past. Last year, he changed some wheat seeds, and this year they were not affected by the disease. The land that did not change wheat seeds suffered severe black rust this year. Residents in Majia Dongling and surrounding areas reflected that black rust disease has been around for three or four years, but no one has paid attention to it (which also illustrates the serious bureaucratic style of the local leadership, who have long neglected and failed to address the vital interests of the masses, leading to severe losses in this summer's wheat harvest – Editor). This spring, the climatic conditions were suitable for the development of yellow and black rust, making it particularly severe.

    III. Several Issues in Preparing for Wheat Planting

    (1) Efforts should be made to organize and prepare wheat land early to ensure timely planting. There is not much time left. Areas that plant one season of wheat should intensify their efforts to organize the turning over of wheat land. Wet ditch land should be plowed earlier, exposed to more sunlight, and allowed to dissipate moisture. The leadership must clearly understand the principle of "early rather than late, ahead rather than behind." Some areas planted too late last year, and this should be overcome this year. (2) Prepare fertilizer. Farmers should be guided to use more smoked fertilizer, kang soil, sheep manure, oil cake, and other dry fertilizers in ditch and wet land as much as possible; and to use more mixed manure, green manure, night soil, and compost in upland to ensure appropriate adjustment of soil moisture. To avoid the spread of disease, diseased wheat bran and wheat straw should not be used to feed livestock or composted for fertilizer application. If it is absolutely necessary to use them, the method of using smoked fertilizer can also prevent transmission. (3) Conduct wheat seed exchange and disinfection. Exchanging disease-free wheat seeds can prevent disease. According to the experience of the masses, exchanging new wheat seeds once can prevent miscellaneous diseases for three to four years. This year, some areas have larger disease-affected areas, making it difficult for the masses to adjust on their own, and it is difficult to select disease-free seeds. Therefore, the leadership must promote this in a planned and organized manner to achieve results. The previously promoted wheat seed disinfection methods were too complicated, the masses could not master them, and the results were not significant. This year, farmers should be guided to conduct a simple disinfection method (for reference, Jin-Cha-Ji used two parts boiled water and one part cold water, added one and a half parts wheat seeds, soaked for more than ten minutes, then removed and dried; or mixed ten jin of wheat seeds with half a liang of ferrous sulfate; or mixed seven qian of good wine with one jin of wheat seeds). The 169 wheat suffered severe yellow rust and has already been opposed by the masses. Now, the reasons for the disease are being analyzed to the masses, the errors of the past promotion work of unilaterally exaggerating and only mentioning advantages without mentioning disadvantages are being examined, and the phenomenon of blindly promoting it in certain areas is being stopped to avoid causing damage. (4) When carrying out the above work, it is necessary to understand the thinking of the masses, educate them to correct certain erroneous views and incorrect experiences, such as some believing that yellow rust and black rust are not related to bacteria and not believing in seed selection or exchange methods; some believing that it is just bad luck; some believing that it is related to mixing night soil after applying cow manure; some saying that diseased wheat seeds will not germinate when planted, and that the seedlings that emerge are all good wheat seeds, so there is no need to exchange seeds, etc.

　　襄垣小麦病害原因及种麦准备的几个问题
    一、病害的情况
    襄垣小麦今夏遭受各种灾害（风、雹、病）者共达五万七千九百多亩，减收两万多石。一、二、四、五、六等五个区（全县七个区，三、七黄未统计在内）共种麦十五万八千四百余亩，患区、黑疸病的有三万九千余亩，占麦地面积百分之二十四点六。六区二十一个村共种麦地三万六千六百余亩，患黄黑疸病的有一万零九百余亩，占麦地面积百分之二十九点九。四区马家东岭行政村北崖底自然村，种麦地一千四百零四亩，患黄疸病的四百四十一亩，患黑疸病的七百四十六亩，病害共占麦地面积百分之八十四点六。因病害减低的收成，一般在三、四斗左右（襄垣今年未害病的麦地一亩平均收五斗，害病的平均一斗五升），个别严重地区有一亩收不到一斗或未见收成的。一般受病的麦籽质量降低，出面减少。
    二、病害发展的原因
    根据夏收中调查所得材料，今年襄垣小麦黄黑疸病害发展的原因，除了病害本身的寄生传染，及今年麦收前雨水较多、湿度很大，气候宜于病害发展等自然原因外，在耕作上还有以下几点原因：（一）襄垣去秋种麦时，正遇参战，劳畜力缺乏，部分麦地没有跟上节令（襄垣种麦一般在白露前后），下种过迟。有的在下雨天下种，垧土过湿。这些麦地今春一般成熟较晚，病害严重。如北崖底全村今夏正茬麦一千一百七十亩，病害占百分之八十二；改茬麦二百三十四亩，病害占百分之九十五。崔守义种红麦二亩一分七，每亩应产量六斗，因去秋种的太晚，今春病害严重，一共才收了一斗五升。赵正西种麦九亩。去秋分三期下种，第一期种的（白露节左右）没有患病，收成很好；第二期种时带雨，垧土过湿，麦籽又深，今春黑疸严重；第三期种的晚了，今年也生了黑疸。五区水碾沟李黄马、赵金魁二人伙种一块地，李黄马种麦二亩七分，是白露下的种，今夏收麦两石五斗，每亩平均九斗二升；赵金魁种麦二亩四分，白露后半个多月才种，今春黑疸严重，总共收了七斗五升，一亩只平均三斗一升。（二）五区兴民村赵三孩去秋种了三块一六九小麦，三种地形，三种肥料，今年收成就有三种。第一种是高地一亩三分，每亩应产量七斗五升，去秋上的熏肥，今夏每亩收麦七斗升，一亩超过应产量一升。第二种是平地二亩四分，每亩应产量一石零五升，去秋上的杂粪，今夏一亩平均收麦八斗三升，每亩比应产量低二斗三升。第三种是沟地一亩二分，每亩应产量一石二斗五升，去秋上的麦疸麦糠沤肥，今夏受病严重，一亩收不到五斗，比应产量低七斗五升。这是土地地势和上粪的影响。（三）麦种的影响。一六九小麦今年普遍黄秸，麦籽瘦小不出面。本地麦种也有黄疸，从襄垣今夏小麦病害情况来看，黑疸病的面积比黄疸病的面积要大。
    该县已有数年连续发生黄、黑疸，上良生产主任赵金有在过去就看见麦地有黑疸病，去年换了一些麦种，今年就没有生病。没换麦种的地今年黑疸很严重。马家东岭一带群众反映：有黑疸病已经三四年了，就是没有人注意（这也就说明了当地领导上严重的官僚主义作风，对群众的切身利益长期不注视不关心，不领导解决，以致造成今夏麦收严重损失——编者），今春气候条件适宜黄、黑疸发展，因而特别严重。
    三、种麦准备中的几个问题
    （一）应组织起来赶早准备麦地，做到赶上节令，应时下种。现在时间已不多了，种一季的地方应该加紧组织垡麦地，过湿的沟地更要早些犁起，多晒一晒，散散水分，领导上一定要明确赶早不赶晚，赶前不赶后的道理，去年有些地方种的太晚，今年应该克服。（二）准备肥料。要指导群众尽可能的在沟地湿地多使些熏肥、炕土、羊粪、油饼等干燥肥料；在高地多上杂粪、绿肥、圊肥、沤肥等湿肥，使土地湿度得到适当调剂。为了避免病害的传染，有病的麦糠麦秸不要喂牲口，不要沤粪上地，如果非用不行时，就用熏肥的办法，也能防止传染。（三）进行麦种调换和消毒。调换没病的麦种可以避免病害。据群众经验，调换一次新麦种可经三四年不生杂病。今年有些地区因病害面积较大，群众自己调剂困难较多，没病种籽又难选择，因此领导上必须有计划有组织的加以推动，才能作出成绩。过去提倡的麦种消毒办法手续过繁，群众掌握不了，收效不大。今年应指导群众进行一种简便的消毒办法（晋察冀用两开一凉的水，加一份半麦种，浸十余分钟，捞出晒干；或用十斤麦种拌半两绿矾；或七钱好酒拌一斤麦种的办法可参考）。一六九小麦黄疸严重，已经遭到群众反对。现在对群众分析病害的原因，检讨过去推广工作上片面夸大，只提优点不提缺点的错误作法，停止某些地区仍在盲目推广的现象，以免遭致损害。（四）进行以上工作时，必须了解群众的思想情况，教育群众改正某些错误观点和不正确的经验，如有些认为黄疸黑疸不是病菌关系，不相信选种或换种办法；有的认为只是天运不对；有的认为是上牛粪后有拌圊的关系；有的说有病的麦籽种上就不出土了，出苗的都是好麦籽，因而不用换种等。
