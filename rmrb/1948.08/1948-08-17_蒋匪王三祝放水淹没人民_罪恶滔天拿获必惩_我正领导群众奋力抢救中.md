[Ji Lu Yu Dispatch] A correspondent from our branch reported on August 1st regarding the details of the crimes committed by Chiang Kai-shek bandit Wang Sanzhu's troops in digging and breaching the Wei River to create a flood disaster: In mid-July, three regiments (316th, 317th, and 318th) of the enemy's 40th Division, 106th Brigade, along with all of Wang Sanzhu's forces, coordinated with various puppet township armed forces to carry out grain-grabbing incursions into our Fourth Sub-district, occupying the Daokou-Huaxian line on the 26th. The bandit Wang Sanzhu immediately directed the puppet Huaxian government and the puppet Daokou Township Office to breach the east bank of the Wei River at the Huaxian Dam north of Daokou South Gate, but the local masses resolutely blocked it. A breach was also made at Xiaoximen, but it was blocked by the masses who built a circular embankment. By the 28th, the enemy continued to breach the Huaxian Dam north of Daokou South Gate, creating an opening more than one zhang wide, and at Xiaoximen, creating an opening more than two zhang wide. Breaches also occurred simultaneously at Huaxian South Dam and Heshangkou in Daokou town. The breach at the north of Huaxian was the largest, and by the afternoon of the 31st, the opening had been widened to more than four zhang. At this time, the river water surged, and the water depth at the breach was more than one meter. The water flowed through the west and south gates of Daokou to Dongguan, flowed north across the iron bridge of the Daoqing Railway to the boundary marker between Hua (xian) and Jun (xian), and reached the area of Kangzhuang, Liuzhuang, Luzhuang boundary marker to Xiaozhuang area, where the masses built an east-west horizontal dam more than thirty zhang long, which finally stopped the water. The water turned southeast and, on July 31st, breached the Changsha Dam west of Huaxian, creating a thirty-zhang-wide gap, flowing into the Huaxian moat and then into the Jia Gong River from the southeast corner of the city. The flood front has now reached Fuzhuang, ten li east of Huaxian city, with a water depth of one meter. In order to rescue the flood disaster created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the three counties of Hua (xian), Jun (xian), and Gao (ling) have formed a three-county flood control committee, which is leading the masses to overcome all difficulties and resolutely carry out rescue efforts. The heinous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which disregards the lives of millions of people with such madness, have aroused strong hatred among the broad masses of the people. The culprit, Wang Sanzhu, will eventually be punished by the people.

　　蒋匪王三祝放水淹没人民
    罪恶滔天拿获必惩
  　我正领导群众奋力抢救中
    【冀鲁豫电】分社记者八月一日报导蒋匪王三祝部挖决卫河放水造灾的罪行详情称：七月中旬，敌四十师一零六旅三个团（三一六、三一七、三一八团）及王三祝全部，配合各伪乡镇武装向我四分区进行抢粮进犯，二十六日侵占道口滑县一线。为匪王三祝即指使伪滑县政府及伪道口乡公所，在卫河东岸之道口南门外滑县坝北头扒开一口，当经该地群众奋力堵住。在小西门也扒开一口，又被群众打圈堤堵挡住。至二十八日，敌人又继续在道口南门外滑县坝北头扒开一丈多宽的口门，在小西门扒开两丈多宽的口门，滑县南坝及道口镇内和尚口，亦同时决口，这四个决口以滑县北头水势最大，至三十一日午后，口门已冲开四丈多宽。此时河水暴涨，决口处水深一公尺多。水经道口西门、南门到东关，过道清铁路之铁桥北流到滑（县）浚（县）的交界碑，经康庄、刘庄、吕庄界牌到小庄一带，群众打了一道长三十余丈的东西横坝，始将水挡住。该水折向东南流，七月三十一日在滑县西将长沙堤冲开宽三十丈之缺口，流入滑县城壕，由城东南角流入贾公河，现水头已到滑县城东十里之傅庄，水深一公尺。为了抢救蒋匪制造的水灾，我滑（县）、浚（县）、高（陵）三县已组成三县治水委员会，正领导群众排除万难，奋力抢救中。蒋匪军这种丧心病狂置千百万人民生命于不顾之滔天罪行，已激起广大人民的强烈仇恨，祸首王三祝，终要受到人民的惩处。
