Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: Zhu Xuefan reported on the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas at the Labor Congress on the 10th and 11th. The report was divided into five parts, lasting nine hours. A summary is as follows:

    First, the Current Goals of the Workers' Struggle in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas

    The current goals of the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are to oppose American imperialism's aggression against China and to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

    The working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has no status in society or politics. They are completely slaves of imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Their lives are considered by imperialism and the Kuomintang to be worth less than cattle. They have no guarantee of human rights or basic freedoms, let alone the right to organize trade unions. Since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution on April 12, 1927, surrendering to imperialism and turning into a new warlord, massacring workers, framing worker leaders, and dissolving trade union organizations, the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has suffered severe devastation and blows due to the implementation of policies to suppress workers and control worker organizations. After the September 18th Incident, the patriotic anti-Japanese movement of workers flourished again. After the start of the War of Resistance, tens of thousands of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas migrated from Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other coastal areas to the interior to participate in anti-Japanese production work. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the decisions of the Political Consultative Conference and colluded with American imperialism to launch a large-scale civil war. The combination of rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial decline, and financial collapse in the Chiang-controlled areas, coupled with soaring prices and the closure of large numbers of factories, forced workers to struggle on the verge of starvation. The Kuomintang ruling authorities further strengthened their secret service rule, restricting trade union activities, violently suppressing the masses, and detaining and massacring workers. However, in order to liberate themselves and all oppressed people, the working class was determined to drive out American imperialism and overthrow the landlord and big bourgeoisie Jiang family dynasty, the running dogs of American imperialism, and continued to resist, struggle, strike, slow down work, and hold demonstrations throughout the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Although many workers have been killed, detained, and imprisoned in concentration camps, making heroic sacrifices, the working class has not been conquered by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. As Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have not been intimidated, conquered, or exterminated. They have risen from the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and they continue to fight." The revolutionary war of the People's Liberation Army has already launched a revolutionary upsurge, and at the same time, in the liberated areas, there is an upsurge of land reform, implementing the equal distribution of land and eliminating feudal forces. This great upsurge of military victory and land reform has had a huge and profound impact on the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, giving them great joy and encouragement, and promoting the development of their patriotic and democratic movement.

    Second, How the Kuomintang Reactionaries Massacre and Control the Workers

    The working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is openly controlled by the so-called "Trade Union Law" and secretly controlled and framed by secret agents. The so-called "Trade Union Law" is an open and unbridled implementation of fascist control over the working class. For example, Article 5 stipulates: "The competent authority of trade unions is the Ministry of Social Affairs in the central government, the county government in the county, and the municipal government in the city." Article 12 stipulates: "All male and female workers who are sixteen years of age or older in the area of trade union organization shall join the trade union as members." Article 43 stipulates: "The competent authority has the right to dissolve the trade union." This means that all male and female workers over the age of sixteen must be forced to join their secret service trap. If there is any activity to protect the interests of workers, it will be dissolved according to the so-called "law." As for secret service control, the Kuomintang Ministry of Social Affairs has set up many "social worker training classes," which are actually secret service training classes. The secret agents trained are sent to various trade unions to work as secretaries and special commissioners to manipulate trade union organizations and monitor worker activities. Major cities have also set up secret service training classes to strengthen control over factories. So-called "worker protection teams" are organized in factories to politically fool and threaten workers, provoke workers' feelings, and beat up active workers. The secret service organization (Central Statistics Bureau) of the Kuomintang reactionary Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau buys off scabs in various trade unions to work as informants, disrupt workers' legitimate gatherings, fabricate rumors, and fabricate charges to frame progressive workers. Workers can be arrested at any time by them with a "red hat" and sent to concentration camps. All the so-called trade unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are now taken over and used by Kuomintang party members or scabs bought off by party members. Occasionally, if one or two trade unions are controlled by workers, they are either dissolved or "reorganized by order" and become secret service territories. Therefore, the "trade union" is not for the workers, and there is no question of seeking welfare for the workers, but it has become a tool for cracking down on the workers' movement and exploiting the workers' welfare. In April of this year, the Kuomintang established a so-called "National Federation of Trade Unions." According to the list of standing directors they announced, Huang Jun is a traitor, Wu Zhiheng was the secret agent who led armed forces to take over the "Labor Association" in Chongqing on August 6, 1946, An Futing was the secret agent who usurped the Labor Association in Shanghai in December 1946, Zhou Xuexiang is a scab who betrayed the working class, and Tian Yadan is a secret agent who once served as the director of the police bureau in Hankou. In addition to appointing this group of secret agents and traitors as standing directors, this so-called General Federation of Trade Unions also has their bosses, secret service heads Gu Zhenggang, He Zhonghan, Ma Chaojun, and Lu Jingshi, behind them.

    The examples of the Kuomintang bandits' bloody massacre of workers are too numerous to mention. In March 1946, workers at the Chongqing D渡口 Steel Plant demanded wage increases because prices were soaring and they could not make a living. Seven representatives, including Xiang Dongshan, were arrested. Workers angrily gathered to demand the release of their representatives, but were met with machine gun fire from the military and police. Four workers were killed on the spot and eighteen were injured. Afterward, the factory was placed under martial law, and the news was blocked, and the families of the dead were not allowed to collect the bodies. In November 1947, workers at the military uniform factory of the Ministry of Military Industry in Qiaokou, Hankou, went on strike because the factory refused to pay the promised bonuses. As a result, eight workers were arrested by secret agents. At the same time, the factory loaded three cars of soldiers and fired at the workers, killing 31 people and injuring 30 or 40 people on the spot. The workers launched a struggle, demanding compensation and punishment of the murderers. On the day of the funeral, 10,000 workers attended the funeral, shaking the 3 million people of Wuhan. In December 1947, workers at the Shenxin Cotton Mill No. 9 in Shanghai went on strike to demand a year-end bonus. Chiang's bandits immediately used fierce firepower of American-style armored vehicles and machine guns, as well as bayonets and tear gas, to carry out a brutal massacre against unarmed men and women workers. At that time, the men and women workers of Shenxin Factory used stones and trolley tracks in the workshop to launch a self-defense resistance, which was very heroic. Executioner and garrison commander Xuan Tiewu personally directed and ordered the killing of all who resisted, and charged at the workers. The shouts of thousands of workers shook the sky. As a result, more than 100 workers fell, and more than 100 people were arrested.

    In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, workers are not only suppressed for fighting for improved living conditions, but also massacred for patriotism. In February 1947, when the Shanghai Third District Department Store Workers' Union held a meeting to promote the boycott of American goods, it was attacked by hundreds of secret agents, and Liang Renda, an employee of Yong'an Company, was beaten to death on the spot. In addition to being oppressed by the Kuomintang, workers are also bullied by American imperialism. Many workers have been beaten to death or run over by cars, and there have been no consequences. A rickshaw puller in Tianjin was run over and killed by an American military jeep, and the rickshaw was destroyed. The worker died in vain, and the Kuomintang police station even demanded that the family of the dead worker pay compensation for the rickshaw. One day, we will settle all these blood debts with these murderers.

    Third, the Tragic Living Conditions of Workers in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas Under Economic Collapse

    After the victory of the War of Resistance, bureaucratic capital established several large organizations to control the factories, Chinese specialties, and industrial raw materials seized from the enemy and puppets. China Textile Construction Corporation controlled cotton and the cotton textile industry; China Silk Company controlled silk specialties and the silk weaving industry; China Oil Company controlled soybeans and peanuts; and China Tea Company controlled tea production, tea making, and tea export trade. As for national industries, they could not get raw materials, they did not have enough working capital, and they could not get loans. Inflation and prices soared. When they sold their finished products, they could not buy raw materials. American goods were dumped in large quantities. Even the smallest things on the market, such as matches, milk, and fountain pens, were American goods.

    Under the circumstances of the dumping of American goods and the rampant bureaucratic capital, industry and commerce in the Kuomintang-controlled areas collapsed rapidly. Factories and shops in various places closed down rapidly and in large numbers. The number of unemployed people in cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas increased sharply. Last year, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Shanghai was nearly 2 million, including 300,000 unemployed workers, accounting for three-eighths of the original workers. Chongqing had 180,000 unemployed people; Tianjin and Qingdao each had more than 70,000 people; Kunming had 60,000 people; and Xiangtan had 48,000 unemployed workers, accounting for four-tenths of the original workers. Other large, medium, and small cities were filled with large numbers of unemployed people. Workers who were not unemployed still could not avoid the fate of starvation because their wages were far behind the soaring prices. In December 1947, Shanghai workers' wages were 68,200 times higher than before the War of Resistance, less than half of the actual price index of 150,000 times. By April of this year, the price of rice had risen 450,000 times compared with before the war, while wages had only risen about 100,000 times. Workers were forced to struggle in the tragic situation of eating everything, pawning everything, and selling everything.

    Fourth, the Heroic Struggle of the Working Class in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas Against Chiang and Against America

    The working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, although under the fascist rule of layers of oppression and being tied hand and foot, did not succumb and were not weak in the slightest. They have always heroically launched resistance struggles in various ways. Their struggle goals far exceeded the economic scope, and they put forward political slogans such as anti-Chiang, anti-American, and implementing democracy, peace, and freedom. Their goals and steps are consistent with the working class in the liberated areas and the national people's liberation cause, which is to overthrow the Kuomintang's autocratic rule and drive away the American imperialists who support this reactionary rule, and strive for the liberation of the working class and all oppressed classes and oppressed people. From October 1945 to March 1946, there were more than 1,000 labor-capital disputes in Shanghai alone, including 755 strikes and slowdowns. In March 1946, Qian Dajun, the mayor of the Kuomintang's Shanghai Municipal Government, reiterated the reactionary order to suppress strikes, but the workers were not intimidated by these many terror laws, and they continued their resistance. In March alone, there were 22 strikes and slowdowns, including more than 400 factories in various industries. Later, in April and May, the scale of strikes and slowdowns was even larger, including 50,000 rickshaw workers, more than 600 silk factory employees, as well as strikes and slowdowns by military uniform factories of the Ministry of Military Administration, buses, trams, and customs employees. In June 1946, all members of the Nanjing High Court, from judges to servants, went on strike, and various places responded one after another. The high courts and local courts in Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Beiping took consistent action. On June 19, 1946, more than 60 worker representatives held a meeting in the Shanghai Huxi Workers' Welfare Association, representing more than 40 factories in Huxi, and decided to organize the "Huxi Workers' Anti-Civil War Democratic Promotion Association," which was the first shot of Shanghai workers against the civil war. The Hudong Trade Union followed suit and organized the Anti-Civil War Democratic Promotion Association. On June 23, 100,000 workers in Shanghai marched and demonstrated, shouting loudly the call of "Oppose the Civil War and Demand Peace." The train of the "Shanghai All-Circles People's Representatives Petition Group Against the Civil War" was ordered to stop by the Kuomintang Railway Authority, but the railway workers automatically started the train and left the Shanghai North Railway Station and headed towards Nanjing.

    In 1947, the Kuomintang Group promulgated the so-called "Emergency Punishment Law During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion" and established special criminal courts to strengthen suppression, but the workers' struggle was not deterred. In May alone, there were 150,000 people on strike and demonstration in Shanghai alone. Throughout the year, more than 3.2 million workers participated in the struggle, including more than 20 large and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Qingdao, Jinan, Tangshan, Guangzhou, and Shantou. More than 50 industries participated in the struggle, including water and electricity, postal services, customs, transportation, railways, machinery, textiles, chemicals, silk weaving, and cigarettes. In 1948, in order to oppose hunger and oppression, 3,500 men and women workers at Shenxin No. 9 Factory in Shanghai went on strike for four days. They were brutally massacred by Chiang's bandits, military police, and secret agents. The workers resisted desperately, and their performance was the most heroic. In April, more than 3,000 workers on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway went on a "sit-down strike on the rails," which brought this major transportation artery to a standstill for a time. The working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has endured all the terror bestowed by the Kuomintang government in recent years, and their class consciousness and political awareness have been greatly improved. They understand that living in hunger is not just an economic issue, but a political issue. Therefore, even under the bloody bayonet threat of the Chiang family bandits, in order to oppose the Kuomintang's autocratic rule, in order to oppose American imperialism's aggression against China, and unwilling to be subjugated people, they are launching a patriotic and democratic movement struggle, responding to the great revolutionary cause of people's liberation led by the people's leader Chairman Mao. They warmly welcome and encourage the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army; they are accumulating strength and waiting to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, liberate major cities, and strive for the final victory of the liberation of the people of the whole country.

    Fifth, the Labor Association's Struggle for the Democratic Unity and Human Rights Protection of the National Working Class

    The China Labor Association (hereinafter referred to as the Labor Association) was established in Shanghai in 1935. After Shanghai fell in 1937, the Labor Association moved to Hankou first and then to Chongqing. At the same time, it sent personnel to contact workers in various places to expand the anti-Japanese forces of workers. In Hankou, the Labor Association and the General Labor Union of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region jointly initiated the National General Association of Workers Against the Enemy. The Kuomintang authorities were deeply afraid that the anti-Japanese forces of workers would increase, so they destroyed it, making it impossible for the National General Association of Workers Against the Enemy to be established. However, workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and workers in the border region still established relations. Liao Siguang and Liu Qunxian, representatives of the General Labor Union of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, participated in the work of the Labor Association. After the Labor Association moved to Chongqing, it assisted more than 4,130 technical workers from the occupied areas to go to various parts of the rear, actively helping with anti-Japanese production and running workers' welfare undertakings, and subsidizing workers' medical, cultural, and living difficulties. In 1939, the Labor Association participated in the International Federation of Trade Unions (the World Federation of Trade Unions had not yet been established at that time) to carry out propaganda and liaison work with workers in allied countries, so that international workers could understand the various arduous and heroic struggles of the Chinese working class in the enemy's rear and the great rear, and oppose American imperialism's supply of kerosene and scrap iron to the Japanese invaders. At that time, this aroused the sympathy of democratic trade union organizations in allied countries, and they used their actions to stop the supply of kerosene and scrap iron to the Japanese invaders. For example, dock workers in Marseille, France, transportation workers in Liverpool, England, sailors and dock workers in San Francisco, USA, and dock workers in Australia all held heroic strike movements to oppose their governments' supply of aid to the Japanese invaders.

    In the workers' movement, the Labor Association has always stood on the position of unity and unification of the workers' movement. When the World Trade Union Conference was held in Paris in September 1945, the Kuomintang authorities refused to issue a passport to Deng Fa, the director of the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union of the Liberated Areas. The Labor Association insisted on going abroad with the representatives of the Liberated Areas as a condition for attending the conference, and finally won this victory. At this time, all 920,000 workers in the liberated areas participated in the Labor Association. At its peak, there were more than 90 worker organizations in various places participating in the Labor Association, with 2,175,177 members. Comrade Deng Fa delivered a vivid speech at the conference on behalf of Chinese workers, which won international praise. At the conference, Comrade Deng Fa and the representative of the Labor Association were elected as directors, and the representative of the Labor Association was elected as vice chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions. After Comrade Deng Fa was killed, Comrade Liu Ningyi, on behalf of the Labor Union of the Liberated Areas, and the representative of the Labor Association jointly attended the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Moscow in June 1946, and the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Prague, Czech Republic in June 1947. The Labor Association has always maintained unified contact with the Labor Union of the Liberated Areas.

    In January 1946, the Labor Association accepted the political propositions of "peace, democracy, unity, and unification" of the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties, supported the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference," and on January 30, the day the "Political Consultative Conference" closed, it discussed with Comrade Deng Fa and passed and published 23 requirements and propositions on the current political situation. According to the published political propositions, the Labor Association organized workers in military factories in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, which were not allowed to be organized, such as the Third Military Factory, the Fiftieth, the Fifteenth, and the Nanjing Military Factory, where tragic cases occurred, which aroused the Kuomintang rulers' jealousy. During the Chongqing Jiaochangkou Massacre in February, four members of the Labor Association and Mr. Li Gongpu, Guo Moruo, and others were beaten by secret agents prearranged by the Kuomintang reactionaries Fang Zhi and Liu Yeqiao. Afterward, the Chongqing Local Court still listed Tao Xingzhi, Li Gongpu, Zhang Naiqi, Shi Fuliang, and Labor Association Secretary-General Yi Lirong and myself as defendants, along with secret agent Liu Yeqiao. After the Labor Association moved from Chongqing to Shanghai, on August 6, 1946, representatives of the so-called "Chongqing General Labor Union" and 200-300 secret agents, led by Chen Tiefu and Wu Zhiheng, "armedly took over" the Chongqing Office of the Labor Association and its affiliated Workers' Welfare Association, Labor Hospital, Nursery, and Workers' Cultural Service Station. At that time, the patients in the hospital and the housewives of the workers' families were dragged out, and Labor Association Welfare Society Director Zhou Ying and 38 cadres were arrested, escorted to the police station's detective team for private interrogation and torture. At the same time, the Labor Association's agencies in Xi'an, Kaifeng, Hankou, Guilin, Tianjin, and other places were sealed off. Yi Lirong and I were both "publicly prosecuted" by the Chongqing Court. However, the Labor Association firmly refused to publish an "anti-Communist declaration" and reject the "Liberated Area Labor Union," and opposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' destruction of the Political Consultative Conference's decision to convene a puppet National Assembly, refused to attend the puppet National Assembly, and issued a public statement, exposing the Kuomintang rulers' conspiracy to undermine the unity of the labor class.

    Under the threatening and terrifying situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the Labor Association could no longer carry out public activities, so it jointly decided with Liu Ningyi, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Labor Union of the Liberated Areas, to move the Labor Association General Association to Hong Kong and continue to fight for China's democratic politics and workers' freedom of organization. This aroused unlimited sympathy from the labor class and democratic parties at home and abroad for the Labor Association, and increased hatred for the Kuomintang rule. In June 1947, the Prague Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions unanimously passed a resolution denying the illegal usurpation of the Labor Association by the general scabs in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Since then, the Labor Association has responded to the democratic revolutionary struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party, supported the thorough crushing of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and opposed the democratic revolutionary united front of American imperialism's aggression against China. In January 1948, it issued a declaration on the current situation in London, putting forward four propositions: "1. Support the democratic revolutionary cause of eliminating the Kuomintang reactionary ruling group. 2. Support and help farmers across the country implement land reform and thoroughly crush the feudal system. 3. Support all political forces fighting for democracy to create a patriotic united front of the Chinese people. 4. Oppose the Wedemeyer Plan and the Marshall Plan." On January 12, Comrade Liu Ningyi and the representative of the Labor Association sent a letter from London to the General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, suggesting a proposal for the World Federation of Trade Unions to take action against the Marshall Plan. The Labor Association has always adhered to the unified position of the working class, adhered to the policy propositions of China's independence, democracy, and peace, and was not tempted by profit or intimidated by power. It firmly supported the propositions of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao: thoroughly crush the Kuomintang ruling group, abolish the privileges of American imperialism in China, and establish a New Democratic People's Republic.

    The working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is now using the greatest determination to oppose American imperialism's aggression against China and overthrow the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. They are actively preparing to welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. When the enemy fails, they will definitely protect machines and all assets, because they understand that this belongs to the people. They will also quickly restore transportation, telecommunications, and postal services. They will also definitely agree to send technical workers to participate in the production of the liberated areas. Because they believe that only under the leadership of the Communist Party to establish a New Democratic New China can the working class and the people of the whole country obtain true freedom and liberation.

　　国民党统治区职工运动
    ——朱学范在劳大报告
    【新华社东北二十六日电】劳动大会十、十一两日大会上，朱学范报告国民党统治区职工运动，报告共分五部份，先后历九小时。兹摘要如下：
    第一、国民党统治区职工目前奋斗的目标
    国民党统治区职工运动目前奋斗的目标，就是反对美国帝国主义侵略中国，和推翻国民党反动统治。
    国民党统治区的工人阶级在社会上、政治上没有一点地位，他们完全是帝国主义和官僚资本的奴隶，他们的生命被帝国主义和国民党看作比牛马还不值钱，他们没有人权保障和基本自由，更没有组织工会的权利。自一九二七年四、一二蒋介石叛变革命，对外投降帝国主义，对内变成新军阀，屠杀工人群众，陷害工人领袖，解散工会组织，实行了压迫工人群众统治工人组织的政策，国民党统治区职工运动就受到严重的摧残和打击。九一八事变后，工人反日爱国运动又蓬蓬勃勃的发展起来。抗战开始国民党统治区成千成万工人，由上海、天津、广州沿海各地，向内地迁移，参加抗战生产工作。抗战胜利以后，国民党反动派撕毁政治协商会议的决定，勾结美帝发动了大规模内战。蒋管区农村破产、工商业没落和财政崩溃三者合一，物价飞涨，大批工厂倒闭，工人们在救死求生的饥饿线上挣扎，国民党统治当局更加强了特务统治，限制工会活动，武力镇压群众，拘捕屠杀工人，但工人阶级为了解放自己与解放一切被压迫人民，他们坚决地要赶走美帝国主义和推翻美帝走狗的大地主大资产阶级的蒋家朝廷，继续不断的反抗、斗争、罢工、怠工、游行示威，遍及国民党统治区。虽然已经有许多工人被杀害、拘捕、关在集中营里，作了英勇的牺牲，但工人阶级并没有被国民党反动统治征服，正象毛主席所说的“中国共产党与中国人民，没有被吓倒、被征服、被杀绝，他们从地上爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹、掩埋好同伴的尸体，他们又继续战斗了”。人民解放军的革命战争，已经打出了一个革命高潮，同时在解放区里又有实行土地改革，实行平分土地，消灭封建势力的高潮。这种伟大的军事胜利的高潮与土地改革的高潮，已对国民党统治区工人发生了巨大深刻的影响，给予他们莫大的欢欣鼓舞，推动了他们爱国民主运动的发展。
    第二、国民党反动派怎样杀害和控制工人群众
    国民党统治区的工人阶级，公开的受到了“法律”上所谓“工会法”的控制，又秘密的受到了特务的控制和陷害。所谓“工会法”就是公开而毫无顾忌的对工人阶级实行法西斯控制。如在第五条里规定：“工会之主管官署，在中央为社会部，在县为县政府，在市为市政府。”第十二条里规定：“凡在工会组织区域内，年满十六岁之男女工人均应加入工会为会员。”第四十三条里规定：“主管官署有解散工会之权利。”这就是说凡是满十六岁的男女工人，都要强制你加入他们的特务圈套。如稍有保护工人利益的活动，便根据所谓“法律”，加以解散。至于秘密的特务控制，国民党社会部办了很多“社会工作人员训练班”，这就是特务训练班，训练出来的特务分子被派到各工会去当书记当特派员，操纵工会组织，监视工人活动。各大都市也办了特务训练班，加强各厂的控制。在工厂组织了所谓“护工队”，在政治上愚弄威胁职工，挑拨工人感情，殴打工人的积极分子。国民党反动派中央调查统计局的特务机关组织（中统局），则收买各工会里的工棍子来作情报工作，捣乱工人正当集会，捏造谣言并制造罪名，陷害工人进步分子。工人随时可以被他们扣上一个“红帽子”而遭逮捕，关到集中营去。现在所有国民党统治区的所谓工会都是国民党的党棍子或受党棍子收买的工棍子所包办与利用。偶然有一二个工会控制在工人手里，不是遭到解散，便是“奉命整理”，变成特务地盘。因此“工会”不是工人的，谈不到为工人谋福利，而成了打击工人运动，剥削工人福利的工具。今年四月，国民党成立了所谓“全国总工会”的组织，照他们公布的常务理事名单中，黄俊是一个汉奸，吴志恒是在一九四六年八月六日在重庆带武装接收“劳协”的特务，安辅廷是四六年十二月在上海篡夺劳协的特务，周学湘是一个出卖工人阶级的工棍子，田亚丹是曾在汉口当过警察局局长的特务。这个所谓总工会除指派了这批特务汉奸来充当常务理事外，背后还有他们的老板特务头子谷正纲、贺衷寒、马超俊、陆京士。
    国民党匪帮对工人的血腥屠杀的例子是举不胜举的。一九四六年三月，重庆大渡口炼钢厂工人因物价高涨，生活没有办法，要求增加工资，被捕去代表项东山等七人。工人愤慨的集合要求释放代表，结果遭到军警的机枪扫射，当场四名工人被杀，十八人受伤。事后工厂戒严，封锁消息，而且不准死者家属收尸。一九四七年十一月汉口桥口军工部被服厂职工因厂方赖掉了答应发给他们的奖金而举行罢工，结果工人被特务抓走八个，同时，厂方装了三车匪兵来向工人群众射击，当场死三十一人，伤了三四十人。工人展开了斗争，要求抚恤、惩凶，在出丧的一天有一万工人送葬，震动了武汉三百几十万人民。一九四七年十二月上海申新纱厂九厂工人，因要求年赏罢工，蒋匪大批宪兵、警察即用美式铁甲车机关枪的激烈火力和刺刀、催泪弹向徒手男女工人进行残酷屠杀，当时申新工厂男女工人大家用石子，用车间里筒轨展开的自卫反抗，非常壮烈。刽子手警备司令宣铁吾并亲自指挥，下令格杀勿论，向工人冲锋，几千工人喊声震天，结果一百余工人倒下去了，被捕的百余人。
    国民党统治区工人不仅为了争取生活改善要受到镇压，就是为了爱国也受到屠杀。一九四七年二月，上海三区百货职工会召开抵制美货宣传会时，就被数百名特务袭击，永安公司职员梁仁达当场被活活打死。工人除了受国民党的压迫，还受美帝国主义的欺凌，许多工人被打死、撞死，都没有下文。天津三轮车工友被美军吉普车撞死，三轮车被撞毁。工友白白死了，国民党警察局竟反要死难工友家属赔偿三轮车。所有这些血帐，总有一天，我们是要向这些凶手们清算的。
    第三、在经济崩溃下国民党统治区工人生活的悲惨状况
    在抗战胜利后，官僚资本成立了几家大组织来统制接收敌伪的工厂，中国特产，工业原料。中国纺织建设公司，控制了棉花与棉纺业；中国蚕丝公司，控制了蚕丝特产与丝织业；中国制油公司，控制了大豆花生等；中国茶叶公司，控制了产茶制茶与茶叶出口贸易。民族工业呢，要原料要不到，流动资金不够，借款借不到。通货膨胀，物价飞涨，卖出了成品，买不进原料。美货大量倾销，在市场上就是最小的东西如火柴、牛奶、钢笔也都是美国货。
    在美货倾销官僚资本横行的情况下，国民党统治区工商业就急速的崩溃了。各地的工厂和商号急骤的大量的关门。国民党统治区城市中失业人数骤增，去年上海失业、半失业人数近二百万，内失业工人三十万人，占原有工人八分之三。重庆失业人口十八万；天津、青岛各为七万余人；昆明六万人；湘潭失业工人有四万八千，占原有工人十分之四，其他各大、中、小城市，无不充满了大量的失业军。而未失业的工人，因其工资远落于飞腾的物价之后，仍然避免不了饥饿的厄运。一九四七年十二月上海工人工资为抗战前六万八千二百倍，不及实际物价指数十五万倍的半数。到了本年四月米价比战前涨了四十五万倍，而工资才涨十万倍左右。工人被迫只好在吃光、当光、卖光的悲惨情况下挣扎。
    第四、国民党统治区工人阶级反蒋、反美的英勇斗争
    国民党统治区工人阶级，虽在层层压迫、缚手缚脚的法西斯统治下，但他们没有屈服，没有丝毫软弱，他们始终在各种各样的方式下英勇的展开了反抗斗争。他们的斗争目标，远远超过经济范围，提出了反蒋、反美，和实行民主、和平、自由等政治口号。他们的目标和步调是和解放区工人阶级、和全国人民解放事业相一致的，就是要推翻国民党统治的独裁及赶走支持这一反动统治的美帝国主义者，争取工人阶级及一切被压迫阶级被压迫人民的解放。自一九四五年十月到一九四六年三月，上海一地劳资纠纷达千余件，其中发生罢工怠工的有七百五十五件。一九四六年三月国民党的上海市政府市长钱大钧，虽重申镇压罢工反动命令，但工人并没有为这许多恐怖法令而吓倒，他们继续着他们的抗争。四六年三月份就发生罢工怠工工潮二十二件，内中包括各业工厂四百余家。以后在四、五月份中，罢工怠工规模更大，包括五万人力车工人，六百余家丝厂员工以及军政部军服厂、公共汽车、电车、海关员工的罢工怠工。六月南京高等法院上自推事下至院役全体罢工，各地纷起响应，重庆、广州、北平的高等法院与地方法院均采取一致行动。一九四六年六月十九日在上海沪西工人福利社里有六十几个工人代表开会，代表沪西四十几家工厂决定组织“沪西工人反内战民主促进会”，这是上海工人反对内战的第一炮。沪东工会跟着组织了反内战民主促进会。六月二十三日上海有十万工人游行示威大声疾呼，喊出了“反对内战要求和平”的呼声。“上海各界反对内战人民代表晋京请愿团”火车被国民党铁路当局命令停止开出，铁路工人就自动的开动了火车，离开了上海北火车站，向南京前进。
    一九四七年，国民党集团颁布了所谓“戡乱时期紧急治罪法”又成立了特种刑事法庭，加强镇压，但工人的斗争并没有被吓退。单是五月份上海一地就有十五万人罢工示威。全年中参加斗争的工人在三百二十万以上，包括上海、天津、北平、武汉、杭州、宁波、青岛、济南、唐山、广州、汕头等二十几个大中城市。参加斗争的产业部门有水电、邮务、海关、交通、铁路、机器、纺织、化学、丝织、卷烟等五十余业。四八年为反饥饿反压迫，上海有申新九厂男女工人三千五百人罢工四天，曾被蒋匪军警特务惨杀，工人拼命抵抗，表现最为壮烈。四月份有京沪铁路工人三千余人，全部“卧轨罢工”，使此主要交通动脉一度陷于停顿。国民党统治区工人阶级经受了这几年来国民党政府所赐予的一切恐怖，他们的阶级意识、政治觉悟已大大的提高了。他们了解生活饥馑不仅是一个经济问题，而是一个政治问题。所以他们虽在蒋家匪帮血腥刺刀威胁下，为着反对国民党独裁统治，为着反对美国帝国主义侵略中国，不愿做亡国奴，他们展开着爱国民主运动斗争，响应人民领袖毛主席领导的人民解放伟大革命事业。他们对于人民解放军的胜利进攻，非常欢迎鼓舞；他们正在积聚力量等待着配合人民解放军，解放各大城市，争取全国人民最后解放的胜利。
    第五、劳协为全国工人阶级的民主团结与人权保障的斗争
    中国劳动协会（简称劳协）于一九三五年成立于上海。一九三七年上海沦陷后，劳协先迁汉口、而后重庆，同时派员与各地工人联络，扩大工人抗战力量。在汉口，劳协与陕甘宁边区总工会共同发起全国工人抗敌总会，国民党统治深恐工人抗战力量增大，乃加以摧残，使全国工人抗敌总会无法成立。但国民党统治区工人与边区工人仍建立了关系，陕甘宁边区总工会代表廖似光、刘群先均参加了劳协工作。劳协搬到了重庆，即协助了沦陷区四千一百三十余位技术工人到后方各地，积极帮助有关抗战生产和举办工人福利的事业，补助工人医药、文化、生活上的困难。一九三九年劳协即参加国际工会（那时世界工联尚未成立），进行对同盟国家工人的宣传与联络工作，使国际工人了解中国工人阶级在敌后与大后方的种种艰苦英勇奋斗，并反对美国帝国主义用煤油废铁接济日寇，当时引起同盟国家民主工会组织的同情，用他们的行动来阻止煤油废铁接济日寇。如法国马赛码头工人，英国之利物浦运输工人，美国之旧金山海员与码头工人，以及澳大利亚之码头工人等，为反对他们政府接济日寇，都举行了英勇罢运运动。
    在职工运动中劳协始终站在工人运动团结统一的立场。一九四五年九月世界职工大会在巴黎举行的时候，国民党当局拒绝发给解放区职工联合总会筹备会主任邓发同志出国护照，劳协坚持与解放区职工代表一同出国为出席条件，结果争到了这个胜利目的。这时解放区的九十二万职工全部参加劳协。在最盛时期，各地参加劳协的工人组织，有九十余单位，拥有会员二百一十七万五千一百七十七人。邓发同志代表中国职工在大会中发表了生动演讲，博得国际上的赞美。大会上邓发同志与劳协代表都被选为理事，劳协代表并被选为世界工联副主席。邓发同志遇难后，刘宁一同志代表了解放区职工总会与劳协代表共同出席了一九四六年六月在莫斯科召开的世界工联执行委员会，到一九四七年六月在捷克布拉格召开的世界工联理事会，劳协始终与解放区职工会保持着团结统一的联系。
    一九四六年一月劳协接受了中国共产党及其他民主党派的“和平、民主、团结、统一”的政治主张，拥护了“政治协商会议”决议，并于一月三十日“政协”闭幕的一天，商同邓发同志意见，通过并发表了廿三项对当前政治的要求和主张。劳协根据了所发表的政治主张，把国民党统治区的素来不准组织之兵工厂工人如发生惨案之大渡口第三兵工厂、第五十、第十五等兵工厂、南京兵工厂工人都组织起来了，因而引起了国民党统治者的忌恨。二月重庆较场口惨案时，劳协会之四人与李公朴、郭沫若等先生同被国民党反动派方治、刘野樵事先布置的特务殴打，事后重庆地方法院却将陶行知、李公朴、章乃器、施复亮及劳协书记长易礼容和本人六人与特务刘野樵仍列为被告。当劳协由重庆迁往上海后，一九四六年八月六日，重庆特务包办的所谓“重庆总工会”代表及特务二三百人便由陈铁夫、吴志恒带头，“武装接收”劳协重庆办事处及附属之工人福利社、劳工医院、托儿所、工人文化服务站。当时医院里的病人与工人家属的主妇都被他们拖出来，并将劳协福利社主任周颖同志及干部三十八人拘捕，押解警察局侦缉队私刑逼供。同时劳协在西安、开封、汉口、桂林、天津等地的机关也都被封。易礼容与本人俱被重庆法院提出“公诉”。但劳协坚决的拒绝了发表“反共宣言”及排斥“解放区职工联合会”，并反对了国民党反动派破坏政协决定召开的傀儡伪国大，拒绝出席伪国大，发表公开声明，揭破国民党统治摧残劳工阶级团结的阴谋。
    在国民党统治区威吓恐怖的形势下，劳协已不可能再公开的活动，故与解放区职工联合会筹备会主任刘宁一共同决定，将劳协总会迁移香港，为争取中国民主政治和工人自由组织继续奋斗。这使国内外劳工阶级及民主党派对劳协引起了无限同情，对国民党统治增加了痛恨。一九四七年六月布拉格世界工联理事会一致通过决议，否定了国民党统治区一般工棍们的非法篡窃劳协的行为。此后劳协响应了中国共产党领导的民主革命斗争，拥护彻底粉碎国民党反动统治，反对美帝国主义侵略中国的民主革命的统一战线，于一九四八年一月在伦敦发表对时局宣言，提出四项主张：“一、拥护消灭国民党反动统治集团的民主革命事业。二、拥护及帮助全国农民实行土地改革，彻底粉碎封建制度。三、拥护一切为民主而奋斗的政治力量，来造成中国人民的爱国统一战线。四、反对魏德迈计划及马歇尔计划。”一月十二日刘宁一同志与劳协代表由伦敦函世界工联总秘书赛扬，建议世界工联采取反对马歇尔计划的行动的提案书。劳协始终坚持了工人阶级团结统一立场，与坚持了中国独立民主和平的政策主张，不为利诱，不为威屈，坚决拥护共产党及毛主席的主张：彻底粉碎国民党统治的集团，取消美国帝国主义在中国的特权，建立新民主主义的人民共和国。
    国民党统治区的工人阶级，现正用最大的决心反对美帝国主义侵略中国，推翻国民党的反动统治，他们正积极准备迎接解放军的到来。在敌人失败时他们一定会保护机器及一切资财，因为他们懂得这是属于人民的了。他们也一定会恨快的恢复交通、电讯、邮务，他们也一定同意派遣技术工人，参加解放区的生产。因为他们相信，只有在共产党领导下建立新民主主义新中国，工人阶级及全国人民才能得到真正的自由解放。
