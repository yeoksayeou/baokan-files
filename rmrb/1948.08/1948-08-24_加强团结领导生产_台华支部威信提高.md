【Taihang News】After party rectification in Taihua Village, She County, cadres and party members were hesitant and afraid to boldly lead, and a certain trend of extreme democracy emerged among the masses. Party member Ma Bangshuan said: When I was leading the mutual aid hoeing, someone taunted me, saying, "Someone is currying favor with the cadres again." After hearing this, I didn't dare to lead. Party member Ma Xuesi said: In the past, we relied on higher authorities, but these days the masses are cursing and scolding, and there's really no way to do the work. The district cadres studied the ideological sentiments of the party members and cadres and felt that they weren't unwilling to lead the masses in production, but were eagerly seeking to learn how to lead the work. Therefore, they convened a symposium of party members and cadres to discuss how to strengthen the Party's leadership and promote the masses' production work. After everyone's research, it was decided: (1) To deeply publicize the Party's policies and stabilize the masses' production morale. (2) To strengthen the unity of new and old party members and new and old cadres, establish a democratic style of leadership to overcome the tendency of extreme democracy. (3) To take practical action and take the lead in rectifying mutual aid teams. After the meeting, party members and cadres went to the masses to publicize the Party's production policies. They also convened a village production committee to check on the production work after the wheat harvest and found that production leadership was lax and village production mutual aid had fallen into drift. The leader of the second team said: "Last year, mutual aid had leadership, and whoever's work was important was done first. This year, everyone is looking after themselves. Leadership must be strengthened in the future." At this meeting, it was clarified that democracy does not mean no leadership. After the meeting, party members and cadres, in conjunction with mutual aid team leaders, held small-scale symposiums in each street, read the Taihang District Party Committee's letter to farmers, party members and cadres, explained the Party's production policies, and enlightened everyone's desire to develop production and become prosperous. Party members and cadres played a leading role, seizing the difficulty of the masses not having water to drink due to the drought at the time, and led the construction of a water pool. Production Director Ma Fachang led his mutual aid team to clean up street soil in sections, which was both hygienic and accumulated fertilizer. The radio station broadcast the deeds of party member Ma Lianyuan and five others in collecting fertilizer, which immediately motivated all the women in the village to take action, forming a village-wide street-sweeping movement. Labor hero Ma Yuheng from the North Street led his team to repair a well, rectified mutual aid, and formulated a production plan for the entire team. Subsequently, all the mutual aid teams in the village formulated plans. Under the systematic leadership of the production committee, the entire village completed hoeing and weeding within fifteen days, and women accumulated 745 dan of fertilizer. At the village-wide meeting to summarize production achievements, various production models were commended. Party members and cadres played their due leading role in this stage of production, and the Party's prestige was greatly enhanced. Ma Faliang, vice chairman of the Farmers' Congress, said at the meeting: "I only had half an acre of land before, and I fled to Shanxi in desperation. When I came back last year, I had land and a house was distributed. I will never forget Chairman Mao's leadership. I request to join the Communist Party and be a good hired hand for the masses under the leadership of the Party." Woman Yang Yinguo said: "Women could not be liberated before the Communist Party came. After the Communist Party came, we were emancipated and no longer beaten and scolded. I am willing to join the Communist Party." At that time, seven men and women requested to join the Party. (Shen Rui, Xing Zhenhua, Qin Junshi, Yao Hanying, Yao Qingquan)

　　加强团结领导生产
  　台华支部威信提高
    【太行讯】涉县台华村整党后，干部党员束手束脚，不敢大胆领导，群众中发生了某种极端民主的倾向。党员马榜拴说：我在领导互助锄苗时候，别人刺激我说“又有人巴结干部”，我听了这话就不敢领导了。党员马雪寺说：从前依靠上级，这几天群众乱骂，实在没有办法做工作。区干部研究了党员干部这种思想情绪，觉得他们还不是不愿领导群众生产，而是急切要求学会领导工作的办法。于是召开了党员干部座谈会，讨论如何加强党的领导，推进群众的生产工作。经大家研究，决定：（一）深入宣传党的政策，安定群众生产情绪。（二）加强新老党员和新老干部团结，树立领导上的民主作风，以克服极端民主倾向。（三）拿实际工作行动，带头整顿互助组。会后党员干部分头到群众中活动，宣传党的生产政策。并召开了村的生产委员会，检查麦收后的生产工作，发现生产领导松懈了，村里的生产互助陷于自流。二组组长说：“去年互助有领导，谁的活重要先给谁做，今年是各顾各，以后必须加强领导。”在这个会上明确了民主不是不要领导的道理。会后党员干部即结合互助组长到各街开小型座谈会，给群众念太行区党委告农民及党员干部书，解释党的生产政策，启发大家生产发家的要求。党员干部起了带头作用，抓住当时群众天旱没水吃的困难，领导着修了一个水池；生产主任马发常领导自己的互助组分片打扫街土，既卫生又积了肥。广播台广播了党员马连元等六人的集肥事迹，立刻推动全村妇女都行动起来，形成全村妇女的扫街运动。北街劳动英雄马玉恒领导全组修了一眼水井，整顿了互助，订出全组生产计划。接着全村互助组都订了计划。在生产委员的系统领导下，十五天内全村完成锄苗，妇女积肥达七百四十五担。在总结生产成绩的全村大会上，表扬了各种生产模范，党员干部在这一段生产中发挥了应有的领导作用，党的威信大大提高了。农代会副主席马发良在会上说：“我以前只有半亩地，没办法时逃荒到山西，去年回来，有了地也分了房子，我始终不忘毛主席的领导，我请求参加共产党，在党的领导下给群众当个好长工。”妇女杨银果说：“共产党没有来时妇女不能解放；共产党来了以后翻了身、不受打骂，我愿意参加共产党。”当时要求入党的男女有七个人。（申瑞、邢振华、秦俊士、姚汉英、、姚清泉）
