　　Danube Conference Makes Victorious Progress
  　Soviet Proposal Eliminates Opportunities for Imperialist Invasion
    The ten-nation Danube Conference, aimed at drafting a new Danube Convention, has been held in Belgrade since the 30th of last month. The Danube countries, led by the Soviet Union, are making victorious progress in this struggle to regain sovereignty over the Danube River. This conference was decided upon at the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1946. Among the ten participating countries, in addition to Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Ukraine which are Danube countries, the United States, Britain, and France are participating as members of the Foreign Ministers Conference, while the Soviet Union has both identities.
    After World War II, the United States, Britain, and France attempted to maintain and expand their imperialist interests in the Danube River basin countries. At the Paris Peace Conference in June and October 1946, the United States, Britain, and France unreasonably demanded that the treaties with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria include clauses identical to those in the old Danube Convention of 1921, stipulating that the Danube River be "open to all countries on a basis of complete equality." It was precisely this clause that had allowed the economic interests and even the independent sovereignty of the small Danube countries to be completely at the mercy of imperialist powers such as Germany, France, and Britain in the past. Therefore, the Soviet Union resolutely rejected this at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, and it was later decided at the New York Foreign Ministers Conference to convene the current conference to resolve the issue of the new convention.
    In the ten days since the start of this conference, the Danube countries, led by the Soviet Union, first rejected the arrogant demand by Britain and the United States to make English one of the official languages of the conference, and also rejected Austria's demand for voting rights (as it had not yet signed a peace treaty), as well as the voting method of passing resolutions by a two-thirds majority. More importantly, at the meeting on the 7th, the Soviet Union's draft of the new convention was adopted as the basis for discussion by nine votes, rendering the counter-proposal by the United States untenable. The Soviet draft is completely different in spirit from previous international agreements on the Danube River and the US draft presented at this conference. It clearly points out in the preface that the freedom of navigation on the Danube River is guaranteed while respecting the sovereign rights of the Danube countries (not all countries). This eliminates all opportunities for imperialists to invade the Danube countries on the Danube River issue. Other clauses formulated based on this spirit are currently being discussed and passed item by item. As Romanian Foreign Minister Mrs. Pauker said: "The era when imperialists forced the Danube countries to obey is gone forever."
    The International Labor Youth Congress, sponsored by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, began in Warsaw on the 8th of this month. The task of the congress is to discuss "the struggle to win the political and economic rights of working youth; the struggle against fascism and imperialism." The congress was attended by 450 youth representatives from 45 countries (including the Chinese Liberated Areas), demonstrating the great unity of working youth from all over the world. The French representatives and the Vietnamese representatives, the American representatives and the representatives of countries enslaved by American imperialism are as close as brothers. These moving scenes prove that the artificial division created by imperialism cannot stop the desire of working youth from all countries to unite.
    Other more important international events in recent times are as follows: (1) Despite the various threats from the Ashida government and the arrests that have already occurred, strikes by Japanese workers against the anti-strike ordinance have broken out among national railway workers in Shikoku and Hokkaido. The Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan sent a letter to MacArthur on the 11th, denouncing the Japanese government's anti-strike measures and demanding that MacArthur revoke his directive against the Potsdam Declaration. (2) A strong peasant movement has broken out in Hyderabad, the largest princely state in India, and this movement has spread to areas neighboring Hyderabad and to several provinces and princely states in northern and central India; the labor movement is also gradually rising in India. (3) The special US Congress convened by Truman for the electoral interests of the Democratic Party has hastily closed after the Republican and Democratic parties mutually exposed each other's crimes.

### 多瑙河会议胜利进展　苏联提案杜绝帝国主义入侵机会

　　多瑙河会议胜利进展
  　苏联提案杜绝帝国主义入侵机会
    上月三十日起，在贝尔格莱德举行了目的在订立新的多瑙河公约的十国多瑙河会议。以苏联为首的多瑙河各国在这一争回多瑙河主权的斗争中正胜利前进。这一个会议是一九四六年十二月纽约四外长会议决定召集的。此次与会十国中，除捷、罗、南、匈、保、乌是多瑙河国家外，美英法即是以外长会议会员国身份参加的，而苏联则兼有两种身份。
    第二次世界大战后，美英法企图仍然保持与扩张其在多瑙河流域各国中的帝国主义利益。在一九四六年六月与十月的巴黎和会上，美英法曾无理要求对罗、匈、保和约中加上与一九二一年旧多瑙河公约一样的条款，规定多瑙河“在全部平等的基础上对一切国家开放”，而正是这一条款曾在过去使多瑙河各小国的经济权益以至独立主权完全置于德、法、英等帝国主义任意宰割之下。因此苏联在巴黎外长会议上曾坚决加以否决，后来在纽约外长会议上，始决定召开现在这一会议来解决新公约的问题。
    这次会议开始十天以来，以苏联为首的多瑙河国家，首先否决了英、美以英文为此次会议中一种正式语言的自大的要求，又否决了尚未签订和约的奥国的表决权要求，以及以三分之二大多数通过决议的表决方式等。更重要的，则是七日会上以九票通过了以苏联提出的新公约草案为讨论基础，使美国所提的对案不能成立。苏联草案与历来有关多瑙河的国际协定，以及这次会上美国草案的精神完全不同。它在序文中即鲜明地指出：在尊重多瑙河国家（而不是一切国家）自主权利的原则下，保证多瑙河的自由通航。这就杜绝了一切帝国主义在多瑙河问题上侵入多瑙河各国的机会。根据这种精神而制订的其他条款现正逐条讨论与通过中。诚如罗马尼亚外长波克夫人所言：“过去那种帝国主义强使多瑙河国家听命的时代，已一去不复返了。”
    在世界民主青年联盟主催下的国际劳动青年大会，本月八日起在华沙举行。大会的任务在讨论“为争取劳动青年的政治经济权利而斗争；为反对法西斯与帝国主义而斗争。”大会有来自四十五国（包括中国解放区）的四百五十名青年代表参加，表现了世界各国劳动青年伟大的团结。法国代表与越南代表，美国代表与被美帝国主义奴役国家的代表象兄弟般亲密，这些动人的场面，证明帝国主义人为的分裂，阻遏不了各国劳动青年要求团结的愿望。
    最近时期中，国际上其他较重要事件如下：（一）不顾芦田政府的各种威胁和已经发生的逮捕，日本工人反对反罢工令的罢工，已在四国和北海道等地国营铁道工人中爆发。盟国对日委员会苏联代表于十一日致函麦克阿瑟，斥责日本政府的反罢工措施，要求麦克阿瑟取消其反波茨顿宣言的指令。（二）印度最大的土邦海德拉巴已发生强大的农民运动，这一运动且已扩展至邻近海德拉巴的地区以及印度北部、中部的若干省份及土邦中；工人运动也在印度逐渐高涨。（三）杜鲁门为了民主党竞选利益而召开的美国特别国会，在共和、民主两党互相揭露对方的罪恶以后已草草闭幕。
