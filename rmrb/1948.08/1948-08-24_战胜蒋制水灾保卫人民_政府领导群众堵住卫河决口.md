[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegraph] Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Wang Sanzhu's troops breached the east bank of the Wei River embankment at Daokou, causing a serious flood. In the three districts of Hua County and Jun County alone, twenty-two villages were flooded, submerging more than 13,000 mu of crops. Upon learning that Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had dug and breached the Wei River, the District Party Committee and Administrative Office quickly instructed the local party and government organs to lead the masses to rush to block the breach. Hua County, Jun County, and Gaoling County immediately formed a joint flood control committee to lead the masses in round-the-clock repairs. By August 9, they had successively blocked four breaches including Heshangge, North Gate of Yangfang, Changsha Dike, and Longmen.
