    North China University Formally Established
    Grand Celebration Held by All Teachers and Students
    [Our Report] North China United University and North China University were formally merged to establish North China University. A grand celebration of the merger of the two schools was held on July 26th. President Wu Yuzhang, Vice President Cheng Fangwu, Dean Qian Junrui and other responsible comrades, as well as more than 2,000 faculty, staff and students from the United University and Peking University attended. Dean Qian delivered a speech, saying, "This is a victory meeting, and also a unity meeting." He said: "In this new era - an era of the victory of the people's power - everyone must throw away the old things and serve the people wholeheartedly, and become a figure of the new era." Vice President Cheng called on everyone to unite closely and study hard. President Wu said: "Our task is significant. We must establish a cultural center for the era of New Democracy. Everyone must have new confidence, courage, and aspirations, and look forward—look at the new forces. Take on the responsibility and complete the major task given to us by the Party in the North China Bureau." He pointed out: "The October Revolution was the beginning of the world revolution, but it will be our generation that completes the task of world revolution. We are qualified for this. Because we have mastered Marxism-Leninism, we have the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and we have the millions of People's Liberation Army led by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De." Representatives of students from Peking University and the United University expressed a warm welcome to President Wu and Dean Qian, paid tribute to Presidents Wu (Yuzhang), Fan (Wenlan), and Cheng (Fangwu), and expressed their firm support for and response to the call of the teachers to complete their studies. The meeting lasted three hours and ended in an atmosphere of excitement, joy, and unity. The entire meeting decided to write a letter to express concern for Vice President Fan, who is recovering in the hospital.

    华北大学正式成立
    全校师生举行盛大联欢会
    【本报讯】华北联大和北方大学正式合并成立华北大学，七月二十六日举行两校合并的联欢盛会。到会吴校长玉章、成副校长仿吾、钱教务长俊瑞等负责同志及联大、北大全体教职学员等二千余人。钱教务长致词称：“这是个胜利大会，也是个团结大会”。他说：“在这新的时代——人民力量胜利的年代中，每个人要把旧的东西扔掉，全心全意为人民服务，做一个新时代的人物。”成副校长号召大家要紧密的团结起来，好好学习。吴校长说：“我们的任务是重大的，我们要建立起新民主主义时代的文化中心，每个人要有新的信心、勇气和愿望，要向前看——看新生的力量。把责任肩负起来，完成党在华北局给我们的重大任务。”他指出：“十月革命是世界革命的开始，但完成世界革命任务的将是我们这一代。我们有这个资格。因为我们掌握了马列主义，我们有毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党，我们有朱德总司令领导的×百多万人民解放军。”北大和联大同学代表向吴校长、钱教务长表示热烈欢迎，向吴（玉章）、范（文）、成（仿吾）三校长致敬，表示坚决拥护、响应各师长的号召，完成学习任务。大会历三小时，在兴奋、愉快和团结的空气中结束。大会全体决定写信慰问正在医院养病中的范副校长。
