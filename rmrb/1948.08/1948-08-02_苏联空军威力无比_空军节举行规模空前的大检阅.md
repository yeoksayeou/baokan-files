Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st - TASS reports: July 18th was Soviet Air Force Day. The Minister of the Armed Forces of the USSR, Bulganin, issued an order to pay tribute to the Air Force and the aviation industry personnel, and grand celebrations were held throughout the country. The grand air force review originally scheduled to be held in Moscow on the 18th was postponed to the 25th due to rain. This was an unprecedented event in the history of Soviet Air Force Day reviews. From early morning, clusters of people gathered at Tushino Airport in the suburbs of Moscow. In the afternoon, as the clock approached four o'clock, 500,000 spectators had gathered around the airport, and thunderous applause resounded everywhere when Stalin and the Soviet party, government, and military leaders stepped onto the reviewing stand. At that moment, ninety-six sports planes, forming the words "Glory to Stalin," flew in formation, passing over the airport. At the same time, three "Pribbenpol-2" aircraft appeared from the other side of the airport, with a large red flag ten meters (thirty feet) long suddenly raised on the lead plane, with two small blue flags fluttering on either side. Until now, no pilot in the world has dared to unfurl such a large flag during flight. Technically, this was considered impossible, but Soviet pilots accomplished this feat. This was the first item on the program, demonstrating the outstanding achievements of the Air Force athletes. Next was a performance by Vinokurov and Chakhudarin, pilots from the Central Air Force Club, with two aircraft flying one above the other, one flying upright and the other inverted. In addition, Moscow's best pilots flew in formation on trainer aircraft. They bravely dove downward and soared straight into the clouds, performing various changing flying skills.

Suddenly, the roar of the aircraft engines subsided, and silent gliders appeared above the audience, performing various maneuvers. At this time, large trucks drove into the center of the airport, and helicopters rose from the platforms of the trucks, circled the airport, and landed slowly and accurately in their original places.

The second item on the program was a demonstration of military aircraft, first with high-speed fighter jets, followed by the most exciting demonstration of jet aircraft. Silent jet aircraft, with speeds approaching the speed of sound (330 meters per second, 1,188 kilometers per hour), are products of Soviet engineering and Soviet industry. After the first and second jet aircraft sped across the sky, five jet aircraft appeared in a neatly arranged formation. This flight was a technically astonishing innovation, because no one has yet attempted to fly in formation with such high-speed jet aircraft. Only Soviet pilots have proven that they can master this technology. It requires extreme concentration of will, fearlessness, high proficiency, and precise calculations in less than a second.

The third item was individual and collective parachute jumps. When the last hundreds of security forces jumped from forty-five transport planes, colorful parachutes unfolded, dazzling, and the audience burst into warm cheers.

The last item was a demonstration of the latest giant aircraft performing long-distance non-stop flights. Each aircraft carried passengers flying directly from Moscow to Bolli, a one-day journey of nearly 10,000 kilometers. The Air Force Day review prominently demonstrated the power of the Soviet Air Force and the unsurpassed leadership of Soviet Air Force personnel in flight technology.

    苏联空军威力无比
    空军节举行规模空前的大检阅
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】塔斯社讯：七月十八日是苏联空军节，苏武装部队部部长布尔加宁特发布命令，向空军与航空工业人员致敬，全国各地均举行盛大庆祝会。原拟十八日在莫斯科举行之盛大空军检阅，因天雨延期至二十五日举行。这在苏联空军节检阅史上是规模空前的一次。清晨开始，一簇簇的人群便云集到莫斯科市郊的图诺希机场。下午，当时钟快打四下时，机场周围已聚集了五十万观众，而当斯大林与苏联党政军领袖步上检阅台时，雷鸣般的掌声响遍四处。正在这个时刻，九十六架体育机，组成“光荣归于斯大林”字样的队形，排空而来，飞临机场上方。同时三架“普里卞波尔——二”式飞机出现在机场彼方，领队机头上突然扬起了十公尺（三丈）长的大红旗，另外还有两幅小蓝旗在其两侧飘荡。迄今为止，世界上还没有一个飞行员敢于在飞行时展开这样一幅大旗，从技术上说，这曾被认为是不可能的，但苏联的飞行员却完成了这一壮举。这是检阅的第一项节目，表演空军健儿的卓越成就。接着是中央空军俱乐部驾驶员维诺库洛夫与查克胡达林的表演，两架飞机一上一下，一架正飞，一架仰飞。此外，莫斯科最优秀的飞行员在教练机上结队飞行。他们矫健地一下向下俯冲，一下又直上青云，表演各种变化多端的飞行技巧。
    突然间飞机马达的喧嚣顿归沉寂，无声的滑翔机出现在观众顶上，表演各种动作。这时大卡车驶入机场中央，直升飞机从卡车平台上扶摇直上，环飞机场一周后，缓慢而准确地降落在原处。
    第二项节目是军用机的表演，首先是高速度战斗机的表演，接着是最精彩的喷气飞机表演。无声的、速度接近于音速（每秒钟三百三十公尺，每小时一千一百八十八公里）的喷气飞机是苏维埃工程学与苏维埃工业的产品。在第一、第二架喷气飞机掠空而过后，出现了五架队形排列得整整齐齐的喷气飞机。这种飞行是技术上惊人的革新，因为至今还没有人企图驾驶如此高速的喷气飞机作列队飞行。只有苏联飞行员证明能掌握这种技术。它要求意志的极度集中、勇敢无畏、高度熟练以及一秒钟以下时间的精确计算。
    第三项节目是个人与集体的跳伞表演，当最后数百名警备部队自四十五架运输机上凌空跃下时，五彩缤纷的降落伞纷纷展开，光耀夺目，全场观众报以热烈的喝彩。
    最后一项节目是最新式巨型机表演长距离不着陆飞行，各机均载有乘客自莫斯科迳飞伯力，一日航程几达一万公里。空军节检阅显赫地证明了苏维埃空军的威力与苏维埃空军人员在飞行技术上的不可超越的领导地位。
