    Jianping County Committee Convenes Emergency Meeting
    Rectifies Discipline and Unifies Strength
    Leads the Masses to Rush Plant and Replant
    [Our Newspaper] The "Production Blitz Week" of rushing to plant and replant is being carried out under leadership in the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth districts of Jianping after a soaking rain. Since the beginning of spring, the whole county, except for the fifth and seventh districts, the upper half of the eighth district, and part of the sixth district, which have been relatively less dry, the remaining first, second, and third districts and part of the fourth and sixth districts (excluding the Hutuo River basin) have had no rain for months. Although there was a rain after the wheat harvest, there has been continuous drought for more than a month since then, so that many villages have not planted autumn seedlings, and many of those that have been planted have died from the drought. After the county was happy to receive a thorough rain, the County Committee convened an emergency meeting of Party and government cadres on the second day of the heavy rain (the 20th), and decided that the Party, government, and people should mobilize together, put aside all other unimportant work, and lead the masses to rush to plant and replant. At the meeting, Comrade Zhang Jilin, Secretary of the County Committee, emphasized: This time, thought and strength must be unconditionally unified, and disorganized states where you do this and I do that are not allowed. Sixteen cadres from county-level organs participated in this work, focusing on the second and fourth districts, combined with cadres from various districts, focusing on villages with the most severe drought conditions, based on different drought conditions, to lead the blitz of planting and replanting, and promote the general. At present, the masses of Jianping are replanting buckwheat, radishes, and vegetables. Regarding the seed problem, each district is adopting adjustments between villages and households, and using loan grain to solve the problem for particularly difficult households. The stretcher companies in the fourth, fifth, and seventh districts have already gone on a distant expedition with the army. At present, a large number of people in other districts are also supporting the front lines, so manpower and animal power are particularly difficult in this rush to plant and replant. The solution is to organize voluntary and equal-value labor exchange; villages with particularly difficult manpower are organizing the whole village to work together, with men, women, old, and young all participating. Military cadres, families of revolutionary martyrs, and families of those supporting the front are the key focus of this rush to plant and replant. While rushing to plant and replant, attention is also being paid to organizing the masses to hoe seedlings and apply fertilizer. On the 25th, this group of cadres went to the districts separately (some of them are working in various systems below). Before leaving, Deputy County Chief Han encouraged everyone: This blitz week is one of the important standards for evaluating each comrade in the future, and I hope everyone will work hard.

    建屏县委召集紧急会议
    整饬纪律统一力量
    领导群众抢种补种
    【本报讯】突击抢种补种的“生产突击周”，正在透雨后的建屏一、二、三、四、六区有领导的开始进行。全县入春以来，除五、七两区及八区上半区和六区一部地区比较不旱外，其余一、二、三区及四、六区一部（滹沱河流域在外）都连月不雨，虽说麦收后下了一场雨，以后一个多月又一直连旱，以致不少村庄秋苗没有种上，已经种上的也有不少旱死。此次全县喜降透雨，县委于滂沱大雨的第二日（廿日）即召开了党政干部的紧急会议，决定党政民一齐动员起来，放下其他一切不紧要的工作，领导群众突击抢种补种，会上县委书记张吉林同志强调提出：此次思想、力量必须无条件的统一，不允许你搞这我搞那的无组织状态。县级机关参加此次工作的干部，当场抽出十六人，以二、四区为重点，结合各区干部，根据旱灾不同情况，以灾情最大村庄为重点，领导突击抢种补种，推动一般。目前建屏群众正补种荞麦和萝卜、菜蔬。对于种籽问题，各区采取村与村、户与户调剂，特别困难户用贷粮解决。四、五、七区担架连已随军远征，其他各区，目前也有大批人员支援前线，因此这次抢种补种中，人力畜力特别感到困难。解决的办法是组织自愿等价的拨工；人力特别困难的村，组织全村大拨工，男女老少一齐动，军干烈属，以及支前人员家属，更是这次突击抢种补种中的重点。在抢种补种中，同时还注意组织群众锄苗压肥。二十五日，这批干部已分头赴区（其中一部是在下边作各系统工作的），临行，韩副县长勉励大家：这次突击周是每个同志将来鉴定的重要标准之一，希望大家好好努力。
