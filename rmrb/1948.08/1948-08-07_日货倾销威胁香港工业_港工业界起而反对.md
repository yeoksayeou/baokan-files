Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Hong Kong's industry and its Southeast Asian markets are facing a serious threat from the dumping of Japanese goods. According to a Hong Kong dispatch published in the Shanghai Shen Bao on May 23rd: "As a result of the massive dumping of Japanese goods, Hong Kong factories have been greatly affected. In the past few months, 71 cotton weaving factories have been forced to close due to their inability to compete, accounting for slightly less than one-seventh of the 988 factories in Hong Kong." The dispatch cited official Hong Kong materials stating that in the first quarter of this year, Hong Kong's trade deficit with Japan reached a huge 4.3 million US dollars. Japanese goods are also being shipped to Hong Kong disguised as American goods. The number of trading companies approved by the Hong Kong government to engage in trade with Japan has increased from more than ten to more than forty. According to Hong Kong's Wah Kiu Yat Po, more than 80 percent of Hong Kong's handloom industry had been forced to stop work by the end of June. Large factories such as Jinlun and Yuanxing, and over twenty others, have also recently announced their closure. In addition, due to the continuous influx of Japanese light bulbs into Hong Kong, twelve of the twenty original larger light bulb factories in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been forced to close, two have gone bankrupt and are being liquidated, and three are preparing to sell out. Since May of this year, Hong Kong's industrial circles have launched a tense movement to oppose the dumping of Japanese goods. On May 13th, the Wah Kiu Yat Po described the anti-Japanese sentiment in Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles as follows: "The tension is almost like the eve of the boycott of Japanese goods in the past." The Hong Kong Women Weavers' General Association also held a conference on June 21st, attended by more than 800 people. They unanimously agreed that the re-dumping of Japanese goods and the invasion of the Far East are the result of the American policy of supporting Japan, and resolved to oppose this evil policy of American imperialism.

    日货倾销威胁香港工业
    港工业界起而反对
    【新华社陕北四日电】香港工业及其南洋市场，正面临日货倾销之严重威胁。据五月二十三日上海申报载香港通讯称：“由于日货大量倾销的结果，香港各工厂大受影响，过去数月间因无法竞争被迫停业的绵织厂，竟达七十一家，占香港工厂总数九百八十八家的十四分之一弱。”该通讯引据香港官方材料称：今年第一季香港对日贸易入超已达四百三十万美元之巨，日货并冒充美货运港，港政府批准从事对日贸易的商行已由十余家增至四十余家。另据香港华商报消息：香港手织机业被迫停工者至六月底已达百分之八十以上，大工厂如锦纶、源兴等二十余家近亦宣告闭厂。此外，由于日本电灯泡源源输港，港九原有较大之电灯泡工厂二十家中，被迫停业者已有十二家，倒闭清盘者二家，准备出让者三家。自今年五月以来香港工业界即掀起紧张之反对日货倾销运动，五月十三日华商报曾描述香港工商界反日情形称：“其紧张情形，几若当年抵制日货前夕”。香港妇女织工总会又于六月二十一日召开大会，到会八百余人，一致认为日货又行倾销侵略远东为美国扶日政策之结果，当决议反对美帝国主义此种罪恶政策。
