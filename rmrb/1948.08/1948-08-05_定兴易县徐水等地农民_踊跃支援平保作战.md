Farmers in Dingxing, Yixian, Xushui and Other Places
Actively Support the Ping-Bao Campaign
[Chahar Telegram] During the Ping-Bao Campaign, farmers in Dingxing, Yixian, Xushui and other places actively supported the front lines, voluntarily collected goods to慰劳 (comfort/support) the wounded and sick soldiers, and warmly received passing soldiers. When a certain unit passed through Caojiaying and other villages in the Fourth District of Dingxing, every household set up tea to招待 (entertain/serve) them. The 24 villages in the district慰劳 (comforted/supported) the wounded and sick soldiers with 1,500 eggs, 36 boxes of cigarettes, and 30 and a half jin of团粉 (tuanfen, a type of starch), noodles, white sugar, and pastries. Cai Ronghua, the director of the Women's Federation in Liucun Village, and Aunt Gao from Zhangjiazhuang led a慰问 (condolence/support) team, braving the rain to persist in their work for five or six days. The masses in Xushui Village District were very excited when they heard the sound of artillery attacking Xushui City. They automatically rushed to grind flour and prepare firewood to welcome passing troops. Li Fenglan and other women in Qingjia Village initiated the organization of a慰问 (condolence/support) team and a tailoring team to take care of the wounded and sick soldiers. The First District and Chengguan (town center) of Yixian jointly organized two慰劳 (comfort/support) stations. Ma Dengping, a female cadre from the First District, personally led seven women representatives from the streets to慰问 (comfort/support) and take care of the wounded soldiers overnight in the rain. Cadres from the Second, Third, and Fifth Streets of Chengguan led 258 merchants and civilians, two large carts, and eleven donkeys to the front to help transport captured supplies. In order to ensure that support for the front lines did not interfere with production, Baipi Village in the Eleventh District temporarily established a mobilization section, a supply section, and a firewood section to specifically take charge of supporting the front lines, while other cadres led production, completing both tasks simultaneously.
