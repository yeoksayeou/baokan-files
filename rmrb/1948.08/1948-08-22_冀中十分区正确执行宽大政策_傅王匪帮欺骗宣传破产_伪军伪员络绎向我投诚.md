(Jizhong Electric Dispatch) Since the Jizhong Military District Sub-district correctly implemented the lenient policy, the deception of its soldiers by bandits such as Fu Zuoyi and Wang Fenggang has been bankrupted, and the number of fleeing and surrendering soldiers and personnel of the puppet regime has increased day by day. After the Fu and Wang bandit gangs occupied parts of the Daqing River north area, they extensively spread rumors to deceive their lower-level officers and soldiers, personnel of the puppet organizations, and their families, saying such things as: "The Eighth Route Army treats others well, but not us," "The Eighth Route Army will bury you alive if you are captured..." In the past, some of our areas also made some degree of "leftist" adventurous mistakes in the implementation of policies, which caused the lower-level officers and soldiers of the Fu and Wang bandit army, as well as the personnel of the puppet organizations and their families, to doubt our party's lenient policy. The lower-level officers and soldiers of the Fu and Wang bandit army and the personnel of the puppet organizations did not dare to flee and surrender boldly. In March of this year, after the lenient policy was straightened out, the "leftist" deviations were corrected, and some puppet military officers and soldiers and puppet personnel, including Wang Wending, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang in Ba County, were released. This allowed the officers and soldiers of the Fu and Wang bandit army, the personnel of the puppet organizations, and their families to have a better understanding of our party's lenient policy, dispel their doubts, and then a great change took place within the Fu and Wang bandit army. For example, on April 5th, when our local militia fought against the Ba County Security Police Team, one enemy squad was surrounded by us, and they immediately surrendered their guns after we called out to them; more than 60 others were quickly eliminated. On June 17th, when we resolved the puppet Da Township in Ba County, the puppet army surrendered all their guns as soon as we started the attack. During the Pingbao Line campaign, some scattered Chiang bandit soldiers lurking in the Rong and Ding areas, after we carried out political offensive, the fleeing Chiang bandit soldiers handed over their weapons one after another. The Rong and Ding local armed forces alone obtained 15 machine guns, one cannon, and more than 100 long and short guns. The number of Chiang Kai-shek puppet defectors is also increasing day by day. The sub-district received more than 700 defectors in February, March and April, more than 1,100 in May, and more than 1,700 in June. From February to June, a total of 3,500 people were received. From June to July, 49 members of Wang Bandit Fenggang's 15th and 17th Assault Teams surrendered to us with their guns. In Cui Zhuangzi, Ba County, 41 puppet soldiers and personnel of puppet organizations fled back in three days from July 16th to 18th. In the three months of April, May, and June, Xiong County has won back more than 100 people. Refugee households have also returned one after another. In Shenglao urban area, seven villages returned 240 households in June alone.

　　冀中十分区正确执行宽大政策
    傅王匪帮欺骗宣传破产
  　伪军伪员络绎向我投诚
    【冀中电】冀中十分区，自正确执行宽大政策后，傅作义、王凤岗等匪徒对其士兵的欺骗遂告破产，蒋伪士兵逃亡投诚日益增多。傅、王匪帮侵占大清河北部分地区后，曾大肆造谣，欺骗其下层官兵，伪组织人员及伪属，说什么：“八路军优待别人，不优待我们这部分”，“八路军捉去就活埋……”。我某些地区过去在执行政策上，也犯了某种程度的左倾冒险错误，因此造成傅、王匪军下层官兵及伪组织人员和伪属对我党宽大政策表现怀疑。傅王匪军下层官兵及伪组织人员不敢大胆逃亡投诚。今年三月间，端正了宽大政策，纠正了左偏，端正了政策之后，释放了一些包括霸县国民党书记长王文定在内的伪军官兵和伪员。使傅王匪军官兵和伪组织人员及伪属，对我党之宽大政策有了进一步的了解，消除了他们的怀疑，于是傅王匪军内部起了很大变化。如四月五日我地武与伪霸县保警队战斗时，敌一个班被我包围，经我喊话，立时缴枪；其他六十多人也很快被解决了。六月十七日我解决霸县城关伪大乡时，才开始进攻，伪军即全部缴了枪。平保线战役中，一部逃散蒋匪军潜伏在容、定地区，经我开展政攻后，潜逃之蒋匪军纷纷交出武器。只容、定地武即获机枪十五挺，炮一门，长短枪百余支。该部蒋伪逃亡也日益增加，二、三、四月份十分区收容了七百余名，五月份收容一千一百余名，六月份收容一千七百余名，从二月份到六月份共收容了三千五百名。王匪凤岗十五、十七突击队在六、七月份先后携枪向我投诚四十九人。霸县崔庄子在七月十六、七、八三天中逃回伪军伪组织人员四十一人。雄县在四、五、六三个月中已争取回来百余名。逃亡户也纷纷回来，只胜劳市区七个村在六月份即逃回二百四十余户。
