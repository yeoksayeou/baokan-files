Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS reports: The Greek Democratic Army continues to repel the offensive launched by the Royal Fascist army in the Grammos Mountains, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy every day. On August 16th alone, it killed or wounded 703 enemies and shot down two enemy planes; on the 17th, it killed or wounded another 243 enemies. Since June, the Royal Fascist army has launched this all-out general offensive to seize the Grammos Mountains, deploying as many as 70,000 troops, but so far, it has failed to achieve its goal other than suffering losses. In an order issued a few days ago, General Markos pointed out the great significance of this battle, saying: "In the battles we are now fighting in the Grammos Mountains, we have added another glorious page to the history of our people's struggle. Last year, we taught the enemy a lesson in the same mountains and overturned all their plans." "While we are holding the enemy here, the Democratic Army is liberating one area after another in Epirus, Thessaly, Roumelia, the Peloponnese, and Macedonia. The Democratic Army is now digging graves for the Royal Fascist army. Grammos must become their grave." The order continued: "There are various difficulties on the road to victory, requiring us to sacrifice, but victory is certain to be ours." The order finally called on the Democratic Army soldiers: "Hold your positions, overcome your fatigue." "We must conquer the enemy. Arm yourselves and crush the enemy!"

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 22nd: Free Greece Radio broadcast: Since the Greek Democratic Army promulgated the two decrees establishing the People's Committee and the People's Court a year ago, Free Greece has made great progress in land reform, justice, education, and health. When Free Greece elected the People's Committee, an average of over 96% of voters in each liberated area participated in the vote. To date, 11,000 acres of land owned by landlords have been distributed to farmers, including the property of King Paul of Greece and the National Bank. After the establishment of the People's Court, litigation procedures are free of charge, but civil cases have greatly decreased instead. The number of cases handled by local people's courts in the past year is only as many as the old regime handled in one day. While the Athens authorities closed many schools, Free Greece has opened many new schools; 44 schools have opened in Roumelia, with 1,800 children enrolled, and 3,500 children have enrolled in central Macedonia, all free of charge. The education of illiterate people is being carried out vigorously, and all illiterate soldiers in the Democratic Army must learn to read and write. In Florina, 1,000 illiterate people are studying in night schools specially set up by the People's Committee. Many clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies have also been established in the liberated areas to provide free services to poor patients. For the first time, the Turkish and Slavic minorities in the liberated areas have gained freedom and equal rights. The People's Committee has specially set up schools for them that teach in Turkish and Slavic languages.

　　希民主军坚守格拉姆斯
    继续挫败敌军攻势
  　解放区建设各方面都有进步
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】塔斯社讯：希腊民主军继续在格拉姆斯山区击退保皇法西斯军发动的攻势，每天都使敌人蒙受极大损伤，八月十六日一天内即毙伤敌七百零三名，击落敌机二架；十七日又毙伤敌二百四十三名。自六月份以来保皇法西斯军即为夺取格拉姆斯山区而发动这一全面总攻，动用兵力达七万人之多，但迄今除损兵折将之外，始终不能达到目的。马科斯将军于日前发表的命令中指出这一战役的伟大意义称：“我们现在在格拉姆斯山的诸战役中，已为我们人民斗争的历史上又增加了光辉的一页。去年，我们曾在这同一山地给敌人以教训，推翻了他们的一切计划。”“当我们在此屹然不动地牵制敌人时，民主军的部队正在艾匹鲁斯、色萨利、罗米利亚、摩里亚半岛与马其顿解放了一个又一个的地区。民主军的部队现在正在为保皇法西斯军挖掘坟墓。格拉姆斯必须成为他们的坟墓。”命令继称：“胜利途中有着各种困难，要求我们牺牲，但胜利必定是我们的。”命令最后号召民主军将士称：“坚守你们的阵地，克服你们的疲劳。”“我们必须征服敌人。全体武装起来，粉碎敌人！”
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】自由希腊电台广播：自一年前希腊民主军颁布成立人民委员会与人民法庭两个法令以来，自由希腊在土改、司法、教育、卫生各方面都有极大的进步。当自由希腊选举人民委员会时，各解放区参加投票的选民平均达百分之九十六以上。迄今已有一万一千英亩地主的土地已分配给农民，其中有希王保罗与国家银行的田产。人民法庭成立后，诉讼手续可以免费，但民事案件却反而大大减少，各地人民法庭在去年一年间处理的案件，只有旧政权在一天中处理的那么多。当雅典当局封闭许多所学校时，自由希腊却开设了很多新学校；在罗米利亚开课的学校有四十四所，入学儿童有一千八百人，在马其顿中部入学儿童有三千五百人，都免膳费。对文盲的教育正大力进行，民主军中一切不识字的士兵都要学习读和写。佛罗里那已有一千名不识字者在人民委员会特设的夜校中读书。解放区也设立了很多诊疗所、医院与药房，免费为贫苦病人服务。解放区内的土耳其与斯拉夫少数民族第一次获得了自由与平等的权利，人民委员会已为他们特设以土耳其与斯拉夫语言讲授的学校。
