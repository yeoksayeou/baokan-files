Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Reports from various sources: American imperialism is conspiring to expand the "Western Union" into a so-called "North Atlantic Alliance," planning to include Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and other countries in this alliance, in addition to the US and Canada. According to TASS, citing the Chicago Sun, the political committee of the "Western Union" in London, under pressure from the United States, has agreed to some of the American viewpoints. The Soviet Labor Daily commented on the 12th on the US scheme to drag the Nordic countries of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark into this alliance, pointing out that the United States has planned three different forms of alliances, such as the so-called "Nordic Union," for the Nordic reactionary groups to participate in this anti-Soviet and anti-democratic organization under the guise of "being loyal to the principles of the United Nations." The Labor Daily pointed out that this conspiracy of American imperialism and the Nordic reactionary groups has been universally opposed by the vast number of people in the Nordic countries. Even many bourgeois figures oppose this conspiracy. The Swedish newspaper, Stockholm News, pointed out that this is an attempt to cheaply lease Sweden to the United States as a battlefield. Sweden should not listen to this attempt. Norwegian workers have opposed the government's attempt to sign a military agreement with the United States in many rallies. A poll in Denmark shows that the overwhelming majority of the Danish people firmly oppose the government's participation in any military bloc.

　　北欧各国人民
  　反对“北大西洋联盟”
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方报导：美帝国主义正阴谋扩大“西方联盟”为所谓“北大西洋联盟”，除美、加参加外，并计划将瑞、挪、丹、意、希、土等国括入此一联盟之内。据塔斯社引芝加哥太阳报载称：“西方联盟”在伦敦之政治委员会，已在美国压力下同意美国某些观点。苏联劳动报十二日在评论美国将北欧瑞典、挪威、丹麦等国拉入此一联盟内的阴谋时指出：美国已为北欧反动派策划出所谓“北欧联盟”等三种不同形式的联盟，以便北欧反动集团能够在“忠实于联合国原则”的幌子下，参加此一反苏反民主的组织。劳动报指出：美帝国主义和北欧反动集团的这一阴谋，已遭到北欧广大人民的普遍反对。甚至很多资产阶级人士也反对这一阴谋。瑞典报纸斯德哥尔摩新闻指出，这是将瑞典廉价租给美国作为战场的企图。瑞典不应听从这一企图。挪威工人在很多集会上反对政府试图与美方签订军事协定。丹麦的民意测验显示，占压倒多数的丹麦人民坚决反对政府参加任何军事集团。
