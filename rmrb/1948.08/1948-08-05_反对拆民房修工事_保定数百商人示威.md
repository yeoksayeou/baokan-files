Xinhua News Agency, North China, 31st: Baoding News: Under the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang reactionaries entrenched in Baoding are in a state of extreme panic. The enemy garrison headquarters, the provincial capital police bureau, and the council jointly issued a proclamation on the 4th of this month, forcing merchants and residents between the moat and the city wall to move out completely within five days in order to demolish civilian houses to build a second moat and bunkers. Subsequently, it was announced that all civilian houses in the four gates would be demolished. Local businessmen, to protest this tyranny that disregards the lives and deaths of the people, gathered hundreds of people on the morning of the 11th of this month to demonstrate and petition, posting slogans along the streets, and shouting slogans such as "Today you demolish our houses, tomorrow we will take your dog lives." When the marching crowd arrived at the garrison headquarters, the police bureau, and the council to petition, the bandits refused to respond. The demonstrating masses then destroyed the office of the puppet council and scolded and beat the puppet speaker. Under the pressure of popular anger, Chen Xianzhou, the head of the puppet police bureau, was forced to come forward to accept the demands of the masses and promised not to demolish the houses.

    反对拆民房修工事
    保定数百商人示威
    【新华社华北三十一日电】保定讯：在人民解放军强大攻势下，困守保定的国民党反动派恐慌万状。敌警备司令部、省会警察局，参议会于本月四日联名发出布告，强迫护城河与城墙间的商民于五天内完全搬出，以便拆毁民房修筑二道护城河及地堡。继之又宣布将拆尽四关所有民房。当地商人为抗议此种不顾人民死活的暴政，于本月十一日上午集群众百人示威请愿，沿街张贴标语，并高呼“今天拆了我们的房子，明天就要你们的狗命”等口号。当游行队伍行抵警备司令部、警察局及参议会请愿时，匪帮均不出面答复。示威群众乃将伪参议会办公室捣毁，并痛骂殴伪议长。在群情愤激的压力下，伪警察局长陈仙洲被迫出面接纳群众要求，答允不拆房子。
