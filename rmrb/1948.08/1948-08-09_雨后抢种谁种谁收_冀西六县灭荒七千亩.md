    After the Rain, Whoever Plants Reaps
    Six Counties in Western Hebei Eliminate 7,000 Mu of Wasteland
    [Chahar Telegraph] From June 9th to the end of June, six counties in western Hebei, including Yi County, Mancheng, Xushui, Wan County, Wangdu, and Laiyuan, launched a concentrated effort to eliminate 7,279 mu of wasteland. The work is still ongoing in various locations. Most of the wasteland in these counties is old wasteland, accumulated over the years. For example, in Wangdu, 61% of the wasteland identified in June was old wasteland. There are two reasons for the wasteland: First, it is formed by objective conditions: for example, the land in the sixth district of Wan County, Dongshao in Yi County, and Yi'a area in Wangdu is wide, the soil is poor, and the yield is low, so the masses cannot cultivate it, resulting in some wasteland. In the frontline areas (areas bordering the enemy) such as Nanzhuangtou in Xushui, farmers cannot cultivate their land in peace due to constant harassment by enemy bandits, and they are forced to abandon their land. In addition, the good land seized by the Japanese invaders to build blockhouses, roads, and airports during the War of Resistance has not yet been fully reclaimed. Second, it is formed by the bureaucratic style of some leading cadres who relax their leadership and do not pay attention to wasteland elimination. A comrade in Laiyuan said without investigation that "there is not much wasteland in the county," but the more than 500 mu of land at the Japanese invaders' airport is still wasteland. If each village can carefully check, it will find wasteland. Wangdu's fourth district, which thought it had no wasteland, found more than 700 mu in 26 villages. Some cadres are not firm in implementing rectification, and the problems left over from the land reform have not been resolved quickly, and the land has not been distributed in time, resulting in some new wasteland. In response to the above reasons, the Fifth Special District of Beiyue immediately instructed all counties to carry out a comprehensive wasteland survey and elimination campaign after the rain in early June, proposing that whoever plants reaps, and if land ownership cannot be fixed, the burden should be appropriately reduced for one to three years to resolve the masses' ideological concerns; requiring all localities to organize and launch a concentrated effort to plant wasteland, and to increase at least one mu of new wasteland. According to the spirit of the instructions, the counties adopted the following wasteland elimination methods: 1. For wasteland with a wide area, poor soil, and people unwilling to plant, and land whose land ownership has not been determined in the land reform, strengthen the leadership of village cadres, mobilize households with labor to organize and cultivate together, reduce the burden, whoever plants reaps, and reasonably distribute the harvest according to the amount of operating labor capital. Villages with a lot of wasteland and little labor, which really cannot be planted, are coordinated by the district to nearby villages; or combined with the resettlement of refugees, and temporarily distributed to the masses fleeing from the marginal areas to cultivate. 2. For land that has been allocated and land ownership has been determined, or land that was not moved in the land reform but has become new wasteland, it should be properly resolved according to the object and situation; for example, if a few landlords and rich peasants have illusions and attempt to take back their original land, and refuse to cultivate it under the pretext of poor land, they will be forced to cultivate it after persuasion and mobilization; if there are indeed production difficulties, they will be actively helped to solve them. The farmers who have obtained land will solve production difficulties and launch a concentrated effort to eliminate wasteland through agricultural loans and mutual assistance among the masses. 3. Conscientiously implement military family production, strengthen the cultivation on behalf of military families, and establish necessary systems to ensure that military families do not abandon their land. 4. Conscientiously implement the spirit of the agricultural tax system with exemption points, fix the amount of land burden, reduce the weighting of bad and barren land, reduce the burden on the tillers, and stipulate that wasteland that has been destroyed to flatten roads, blockhouses, and wasteland with low weighting that is difficult to cultivate can be reduced or exempted from the burden for one to three years depending on the circumstances. The masses have been relieved of various ideological concerns, and the above-mentioned achievements have been made in the concentrated effort to eliminate wasteland.

    雨后抢种谁种谁收
    冀西六县灭荒七千亩
    【察哈尔电】冀西易县、满城、徐水、完县、望都、涞源等六县，自六月九日至六月底，共突击消灭荒地七千二百七十九亩，现各地仍在继续消灭中。各县荒地大部是旧荒，多为逐年累积而成。如望都六月份查出的荒地，其中百分之六十一是旧荒。造成荒地的原因有两个：一是客观条件形成的：如完县六区、易县东邵、望都抑阿一带地面宽、土质坏、产量小，群众种不了，结果荒了一些。徐水南庄头等前方区（接敌区）在敌匪不断骚扰的情况下，农民不能在家安心耕种，被迫荒芜土地。还有抗战期间被日寇抢占修炮楼、汽路、飞机场的良田，至今尚未全部开荒耕种。二是由于某些领导干部官僚主义，放松领导，不重视灭荒形成的。涞源某同志不经调查就说“全县没多少荒地”，但日寇的飞机场的五百多亩地至今仍在荒着。各村如能好好检查一下，多少都会发现荒地。自认为没有荒地眺望都四区，二十六个村都查出七百多亩。有些干部执行纠偏不坚决，土改中遗留的问题未迅速解决，土地未及时分配下去，耽误了春耕，出现了一些新荒。北岳五专署针对上述原因，于六月初落雨后，立即指示各县全面开展查荒灭荒运动，提出谁种谁收，不能固定地权的，适当减免一年至三年的负担，以解决群众思想顾虑；要求各地组织起来，突击种荒，最低的再增加一亩新荒。各县根据指示精神，采用了下列各种灭荒办法：一、对于地面广、地质坏、人们不愿种的荒地，及土改中地权未确定的土地，加强村干部的领导，发动有劳力户组织起来合伙耕种，减免负担，谁种谁收，按经营劳力资本的多少合理分配收获物。荒地多、劳力少，实在种不过来的村，由区调剂给附近村；或结合安置难民，临时分给边缘区逃来的群众耕种。二、已经分配并确定了地权，或土改中未动的土地新荒了，则分别对象和情况适当解决；如少数地主富农抱有幻想，企图拿回自己的原地，借口地坏而不耕种，经说服动员无效，即行强制耕种；如确有生产困难，则主动帮助解决。得地农民则通过农贷，及群众间的互助互济，解决生产困难，突击灭荒。三、认真执行军属生产，加强对军属的代耕，建立必要的制度，保证军属不荒地。四、认真贯彻有免征点的比农业税制的精神，固定土地负担量，降低坏、荒地的应重量，减轻耕者的负担，并规定毁平汽路、炮楼及重量低又难耕难种的荒地，可斟情减免一年到三年的负担。群众解除了各种思想顾虑，突击灭荒，已获得上述成绩。
