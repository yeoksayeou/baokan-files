(Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram) Cadres in the Fifth District of Neihuang disregarded the severe threat of flooding to the broad masses, resulting in avoidable losses, submerging hundreds of hectares of farmland. According to a report by Comrade Chang Liu of the Eighth Special District Construction Section, on July 27th, the Wei River's water level rose and flowed into the Xiao River. By the 30th, the Xiao River overflowed, flooding the slopes along the Wei River's Second District, near Xiyangshao and Sudi. The masses in villages like Jicun, Tongzhuang, and Mashang in the Fifth District of Neihuang, fearing the water would continue to flood south, reinforced the original dry dike along the riverbank to prevent the water from flowing south. However, the masses in Xiyangshao demanded it be torn down to reduce local water accumulation, resulting in a dispute. After the Eighth Special District sent people to persuade them, the masses in Xiyangshao allowed Neihuang to repair the dike to prevent the flood from expanding. However, the leading comrades of the Fifth District did not pay attention to the flood control work and failed to provide leadership. Only the masses from three or four villages, such as Jicun and Mashang, were working on the dry dike, which was over ten li long, and the Xiao River dike. No district-level cadres were seen providing leadership, resulting in a lack of unified action and the inability to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, when a section of the dike was about to be breached by the water, the masses used baskets, iron shovels, and even brought soil from the school to fill the gaps. They hammered in a few stakes in more critical areas, but nothing else was prepared. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, Comrade Chang Liu of the Special District Construction Section went to inspect the dike again and found it was still not repaired. He sent a letter to the Fifth District, but after the letter arrived at the district office, the cadres were all asleep. No one read the letter, saying, "Don't disturb our sleep, we'll look at it tomorrow." The next day (the 4th), before the cadres of the Fifth District even went to the dike, the breach occurred, and at least a hundred hectares of crops were submerged. Opinion of the Ji-Lu-Yu Branch of the Xinhua News Agency: The cadres of the Fifth District of Neihuang lack a mass perspective and their bureaucratic style is so serious that a simple self-criticism and review should not suffice. Instead, necessary disciplinary actions should be taken based on the circumstances to uphold the seriousness of the democratic government's responsibility to the people. However, from the report, it appears that the Neihuang County government and the Eighth Special District had not yet given sufficient attention to the matter at the time. It is hoped that this will be handled immediately and swiftly, and that leadership will be urged to rescue the flood victims.

### 内黄五区区干忽视防汛　酿成水灾该受处分

　　内黄五区区干忽视防汛
  　酿成水灾该受处分
    【冀鲁冀电】内黄五区干部对于严重危胁广大群众之水灾不加注意，致造成不应有之损失，淹没田禾百顷。据八专署建设科常流同志报导，七月二十七日卫河水涨灌入硝河，到卅号硝河水出槽，把卫河二区西阳邵苏堤一带坡地淹了。内黄五区吉村、同桩、马上等村群众，怕水继续往南淹，便使原来的隔河坡的旱堤加修，防止水向南流。西阳邵群众却要求扒去，以减少当地积水量，结果双方发生争执，经八专署派人前往说服，西阳邵的群众允许了内黄修堤，不让水灾扩大。但五区的领导同志，对堵水工作非常重视，不加领导，在长约十数里的旱堤，和硝河堤上只有吉村、马上等三四个村群众在堵，没见到区里一个干部领导，以至群众行动上不统一，积极性不能充分发挥。比如那一段堤将要被水冲开时，群众便用篮子、铁锨、学校端出土堵积，更紧的地方插上几个桩，其余别的什么也没准备。本月三日下午专署建设科常流同志又去看堤时，仍是没修好，于是给五区去了封信，但信送到区里以后，干部都正睡觉，谁也不看信，他们说：“耽误瞌睡明天看吧。”第二天（四日）早饭时，五区干部还都没去堤上就开口子了，至少约有百十来顷庄稼被淹没。冀鲁豫分社意见：内黄五区干部没有群众观念，官僚主义如此严重，不应只进行反省检讨，即草草了事。而应按照情况，分别予以必要的纪律制裁，以维民主政府对人民负责之严肃性。但从报导中看，当时内黄县政府及八专署也尚未十分重视。望立即迅速处理。并督促领导抢救水灾。
