Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th – Before the recent southern front operation in the Huanglong Sub-district, the Northwest People's Liberation Army extensively launched a thrift and disaster relief campaign, deepening their concern for the people and their hatred for the Chiang and Hu bandits. Zhao Qingliang, a liberated soldier of the 11th Company of a certain unit, said sadly while donating items: "In the past, when I was a soldier in Hu bandit's 91st Division, I trampled on the people so pitifully. I forgot my roots and let down the border region people. I must eliminate the Hu bandits to atone for my sins and repay them." The artillery company, enraged by the accusations of Hu bandit atrocities, immediately donated 97 pieces of clothing, 1.75 zhang of cloth, 200,000 agricultural currency, and socks and clothing, and wrote a letter of condolence saying: "Victory is not far away. We will fight bravely and eliminate the Hu bandits to avenge you." A certain unit has now donated a total of 62,348 jin of fine grain saved through thrift, 15.7 million agricultural currency, 489 pieces of clothing, and more than 30 zhang of cloth. These thrift and disaster relief materials have been successively sent to the Border Region Production and Disaster Relief Committee, which is distributing them to disaster victims in various places.

　　真是人民子弟兵
  　西北我军节约救灾
    【新华社西北廿六日电】西北人民解放军在此次黄龙分区南线作战前，曾广泛展开节约救灾运动，加深了对人民的关怀，和对蒋、胡匪的仇恨。某部十一连解放战士赵清亮在捐出东西时沉痛的说：过去我在胡匪九十一师当兵，把人民＠踏得那样可怜，我忘了本，对不起边区人民，我要消灭胡匪赎罪报仇。炮兵连在控诉胡匪暴行的激愤下，立即捐出衣服九十七件，布一丈七尺五寸，农币二十万元及鞋袜衣服等件，并写慰问信说：“胜利已经不远，我们一定勇敢作战，消灭胡匪，为你们报仇。”某部现已共捐出节约下的细粮六万二千三百四十八斤，农币一千五百七十万元，衣服四百八十九件，布三十余丈。这些节约救灾的物资，现已陆续送达边区生产救灾委员会。该会正分发各地灾民。
