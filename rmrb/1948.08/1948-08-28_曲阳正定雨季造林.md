　　Quyang Zhengding Rainy Season Afforestation
    [Beiyue News] In recent years, many trees along the Shahe River in Quyang County have been damaged, and strong winds and sand have buried a lot of good land. The masses urgently demanded tree planting. The county leadership decided to specially assign three cadres from the Industry and Commerce Section to lead this work, mobilize the masses to prepare saplings in advance, launch the masses to formulate forest protection covenants, and actively take action as soon as the hot season began. In ten villages in the third and fifth districts, 5,067 trees were planted. Beixingshu Village alone planted 1,500 trees. In the fourth district of Zhengding, each village was divided into several large groups, and experienced tree planters were selected from each group to be responsible for planting trees, and the work was scientifically divided. Those who found seedlings, those who transported seedlings, and those who dug pits all performed their duties and cooperated closely. Women and children also participated in this movement. The original plan was completed in three days, with only seven villages not fully counted. A total of 37,800 trees were planted. The masses responded very well to the government's leadership in tree planting. They said: "It is easier for trees to survive when planted in the rainy season. Trees can prevent wind and flood, protect farmland, increase income, and provide firewood. This call is really satisfying." (Zhao Laifu, Han Fengyi, Zhao Bo)
    [Jizhong Telegraph] Some villages in Zhaoxian and Gaocheng counties are afforesting during the rainy season. In the four villages of Nanwang, Beiwang, Baigoutuo, and Xijiang along the Shahe River in Zhaoxian County, sandy land accounts for one-fifth of the village's land. After the heavy rain, the Administrative Office afforestation team, in cooperation with the village production committees, hired experienced veteran farmers to form afforestation committees. Village cadres took the lead actively, and women also actively participated. In six or seven days, more than 11,900 trees have been planted, eliminating 458 mu of sandy wasteland. In Liangjiazhuang, Gaocheng, 30 mu of windbreak forest were planted in less than two days. Huangjiazhuang, Shezhuang and other villages have also begun active afforestation. According to statistics from six villages, more than 15,000 trees have been planted.

　　曲阳正定雨季造林
    【北岳讯】近几年来，曲阳沿沙河林木损坏很多，大风沙压了很多好地，群众迫切要求植树。该县领导上决定由实业科专门抽出三个干部领导此一工作，动员群众事先准备了树秧，发动群众制订了护林公约，入伏即积极行动起来。三、五区十个村庄，完成了五○六七棵。只北杏树一村即植树一千五百棵。正定四区每村分成几个大组，每组选出植树有经验的人负责栽树，并科学地分了工，找秧的，运秧的挖坑的各司其事，密切配合。妇女儿童也参加了这一运动。三天中完成原计划，仅七个村不完全统计。共植树三七八○○棵。群众对政府领导植树反映很好，他们说：“雨季种树好活，树林能防风防水，保护田园，又能增加收入，又有了柴烧，这一号召真是趁心。”（赵莱夫、韩风义、赵波）
    【冀中电】赵县、藁城有些村庄，雨季造林。赵县沿沙河的南王、北王、白沟驮、西江等四个村，沙地占全村土地的五分之一。这次大雨后，行署造林队协同各村生产委员会聘请了有造林经验的老农，组成造林委员会。各村干部积极带头，妇女们也积极参加，六七天中，已栽树一万一千九百余棵，消灭了沙荒地四百五十八亩。藁城梁家庄，不到两天，就种好了三十亩的防风林。黄家庄、舍庄等村也开始积极造林。据六个村统计，已植树一万五千余棵。
