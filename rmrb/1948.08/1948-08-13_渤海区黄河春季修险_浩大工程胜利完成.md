Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: The massive spring repair project on the Yellow River in the Bohai area has been successfully completed. The Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau recently convened a meeting of directors from eleven county offices along the river to summarize the spring repair experience and prepare for flood control during the high-water season. The spring repair project commenced in early February and concluded in early June. Stretching from Daliushu Shop in Jiyang in the west to Kenli (a newly established county northeast of Lijin) in the east, the riverbank spans over four hundred li, encompassing counties such as Jiyang, Qingcheng, Huimin, and Lijin, with forty-three hazardous points. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 635 new and repaired brushwood dams were constructed, 42 new dam foundations were built, and 30 sections were raised, thickened, and heightened. At the Kenli estuary, 160 li of new dikes were added (potentially saving thousands of acres of fertile land on both banks). The largest of these projects, the Huang Dam at the Putai Mawan major hazard point, is 22 li long. In total, this project used over 32,000 cubic meters of brick and stone, over 2,564,000 cubic meters of earth, over 2,766,000 catties of straw and other materials, employed 21,352,000 man-days of civilian and technical labor, and paid out over 37,500,000 catties of wages in kind, and 190 million Northern Currency. In addition, a large quantity of bricks, stones, earth boards, and other materials were prepared for flood control during the summer high-water season.

The scale of this spring repair project in the region is unprecedented since the Kuomintang's management of the Yellow River. According to the former Kuomintang Shandong Provincial "River Affairs Special Issue," the total budget for spring repairs on the Yellow River in the five years of the Republic of China, years 18, 19, 20, 23, and 24 (assuming no deductions or embezzlement), was for the repair of over 295,400 cubic meters of earthwork, only 11.7% of this year's spring repair earthwork. The amount of straw used was only 40% of this time. The 581,000+ Kuomintang currency used if converted at a rate of 0.6 National Currency per dou of grain is only 66% of this spring's grain expenditure. During this Yellow River spring repair, Kuomintang troops and aircraft constantly strafed and harassed the workers. On March 4th, Chang Jiantang, a civilian worker at the Luo Family hazard point in Jiyang, was shot and killed by Kuomintang troops sealing off the bank. On the 18th of the same month, Kuomintang aircraft repeatedly strafed Gouyangjia, killing and wounding five material transport workers, including Chunxun. Since April 16th, Kuomintang aircraft have continuously fired at various sections of Jiyang. However, thanks to the valiant repair efforts of our army and people, the spring repair project was finally successfully completed.

　　渤海区黄河春季修险
  　浩大工程胜利完成
    【新华社华东十一日电】渤海黄河春季修险浩大工程已胜利完成。山东省河务局近特召开沿河十一个县办事处主任会议，总结春修经验并准备大汛抢险。春修工程系于二月初开工，六月初竣工。西起济阳大柳树店，东至恳利（新设县，利津东北部），河岸长达四百余里，包括济阳、青城、惠民、利津等各县，险工四十三处。据不完全统计，共新修及补修埽坝六三五段，新修坝基四二段，提身加厚加高者三十段，恳利入海处增修新堤一六○里（两岸可救出肥田千顷）。其中最大的蒲台麻湾大险工之皇坝即长达二十二里。总计此次工程共用砖石料三万二千余公方，土二百五十六万四千余公方、秸料等二百七十六万六千余斤，民工和技术工共二千一百三十五万二千余个，支付工资粮三千七百五十余万斤，北币十九万万元。另为夏季大汛抢险准备了大批砖石土板等物。
    这次该区春修工程之浩大，是从国民党治黄以来空前的一次。据前国民党山东省“河务特刊”载：民国十八、十九、二十、二十三、二十四等五年，黄河春修预算（假定不加任何克扣贪污）共修土工二十九万五千四百余公方，仅及今年春修土工的百分之十一·七，所用秸料仅及此次百分之四十，所用国民党币五十八万一千余元，以六角折合一斗粮计算，亦仅及今春用粮款的百分之六六。此次黄河春修中，国民党军及国民党飞机曾不断扫射骚扰。三月四日济阳罗家险工民工昌建堂，为封岸国民党军扫射致死。同月十八日国民党机在沟阳家轮番扫射，打死打伤运料民工春训等五人。自四月十六日以后，国民党机更连续向济阳各段射击。但在我军民奋勇抢修下，春修工程终于胜利完成。
