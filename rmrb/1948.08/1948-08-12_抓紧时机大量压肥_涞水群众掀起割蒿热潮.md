　　[Chahar Dispatch] Since late July, continuous rain has fallen. The Laishui County Party Committee urgently instructed to cut Artemisia for fertilizer, requiring cadres to take the lead, widely mobilizing women, children, and the elderly to participate, with Party members playing a guarantee role, ensuring an average of 30 loads of fertilizer per mu. They also helped the families of military personnel and martyrs who lacked labor to ensure they had enough fertilizer for the coming year. Currently, a feverish campaign to apply fertilizer has been launched throughout the county. On the evening of the 24th, the County Party Committee held an emergency meeting of cadres from various departments to specifically arrange tasks to help resident military, worker, and martyr families cut 40,000 jin of Artemisia, applying 30 loads of fertilizer per mu. The next day, all units took action. Cadres from the Judicial Office, guards, and newly freed people all went out together. Wang, the Political Commissar of the Political Department, led cadres to cut more than 3,000 jin of Artemisia in one afternoon. Every day after dinner, all units lined up and set off to the mountains to cut Artemisia. Under the practical influence of the county cadres, a feverish campaign to apply fertilizer was simultaneously launched in various villages. In Tangjiazhuang and Huanghuakou and two other villages in the Third District, more than 169,000 jin of Artemisia were cut in forty days. In the Fifth District, Xia Zhuang Village discussed the issue of helping military, worker, and martyr families apply fertilizer at a meeting of cadres and the masses. The next day, led by 15 government and civilian cadres, all the young and middle-aged people in the village cut more than 13,900 jin of Artemisia for the military, worker, and martyr families in the morning, 13 children cut 1,950 jin of Artemisia, and 11 women cut 2,750 jin of Artemisia. In the afternoon, they chopped Artemisia and carried soil to pad the pens, which could produce 2,000 baskets of fertilizer, enough to solve the fertilizer problem for more than 40 mu of land. In the Sixth District, the Beichengsi branch, through its call and with Party members taking the lead, organized eight production mutual aid groups with 37 people, who are now launching a crash program to plant turnips and press green manure. Shangzhuang Village in the district, under the leadership of mass organizations, separately led a crash program to apply fertilizer. Ten young women, led by Zhang Shifu, the deputy director of the Women's Federation, cut 1,200 jin of Artemisia in one day; 24 young people, led by Liu You, the director of the Youth League, cut 9,000 jin of Artemisia in three days. Currently, farmers in various villages are continuing to launch a crash program to apply fertilizer in large quantities in order to lay the foundation for next year's great production.
