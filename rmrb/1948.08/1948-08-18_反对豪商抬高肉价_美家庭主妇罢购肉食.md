　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Electone News Agency, New York, 9th: The Chicago branch of the Wallace-supporting Women's Congress has announced the launch of a meat boycott movement to protest the soaring meat prices. They are leading housewives in many towns into action through radio, telephone, and leaflets. The boycott movement has spread to Wisconsin, Minnesota, Utah, and other states. In New Orleans, Louisiana, the "Women's United Front Against Inflation," representing 150,000 women, announced that they will not buy meat until prices fall. Many retailers have also joined this protest movement. The supply of the American meat market is controlled by a few large slaughtering companies, which, along with other major American corporations, are currently raising prices to exploit the people. The price of beef and mutton has now risen to more than one U.S. dollar per pound, while before the war, beef was only worth about 35 cents per pound.

  　美家庭主妇罢购肉食
    【新华社陕北十四日电】电通社纽约九日讯：拥护华莱士妇女大会芝加哥分会，宣布发动罢购肉食运动，以反对肉价的飞涨。她们正以广播、电话及传单，领导许多城镇的家庭主妇进入行动。罢购运动已扩至威斯康星、明尼苏达、犹他等州。在路易斯安那州的新奥尔良，代表十五万妇女的“抵抗通货膨胀妇女联合会”宣布，她们在肉价跌落以前，将不买肉。许多零售商也参加了这一抗议运动。按美国肉类市场的供应系操在少数大屠宰公司手中，它们目前正和美国其他各大企业一起，高抬物价以榨取人民的血汗。每磅牛羊肉的价格，现已涨达美金一元有奇，而战前每磅牛肉则仅值三角五分左右。
