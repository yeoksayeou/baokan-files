A Factory in Shijiazhuang Improves Management
	Summer Production Exceeds Plan
[Shijiazhuang News] A certain factory in Shijiazhuang exceeded its production plan in the summer. From April to June, cotton yarn production completed 247.4% of the original plan, and cotton cloth production completed 269.7% of the plan. Comparing spring and summer production: summer cotton yarn production increased more than fourfold compared to spring, and cotton cloth increased more than eightfold. While increasing production, workers also ensured improved quality. According to cotton yarn merchants, "The yarn is much better now than it was in the past (referring to pre-liberation); the quality of the new cotton cloth is also higher than the old cotton cloth."

The factory was able to achieve today's results because, first: it took the initiative in management, earnestly solved the difficulties of workers, and implemented a system of rationing food at low prices, so that workers' production enthusiasm would not fluctuate due to the price fluctuations at the time. Second: it united more than one-third of the basic backbone, such as technicians and skilled workers, and cultivated activists, who played a positive role in production. Third: it strictly enforced discipline and clearly distinguished rewards and punishments. For example, the exposure of the purchasing agent Nie Xiaoyun's embezzlement and the education of individual female workers who stole yarn enlightened the workers' political consciousness. Fourth: it implemented a three-meter wage system and established a labor assessment system, which promoted both output and quality. Fifth: it strengthened the study of young workers and improved their production enthusiasm. During shift changes, workers voluntarily requested to work overtime. The factory was restored and rebuilt under very difficult conditions. Although it has achieved the above results, there are still many shortcomings: such as the fact that all the systems within the factory have not yet fully become regularized. In production, in addition to focusing on improving quality, standard work methods have not yet been fully implemented in all workshops, all of which need to be improved. Starting in July, all factory employees are further examining the work of the entire factory and improving the shortcomings of the past in accordance with the new spirit of the industrial and commercial conference, so as to make the factory's management, systems, wages, and other issues more rational.

    石市某厂改善管理
    夏季生产超过计划
    【石家庄讯】石市某厂夏季生产超过计划。四、五、六月棉纱产量完成原计划百分之二四七·四，棉布产量完成计划百分之二六九·七。按春夏二季生产量比较：夏季棉纱产量比春季增到四倍强，棉布增到八倍强。工人们在生产中同时保证提高质量。据棉纱商人说：“现在纱比过去（指解放前）好多了；新棉布比旧棉布质量也高了。”
    该厂所以能获得今天的成绩，第一：在管理上争取主动，切实解决工人困难，实行定量低价配卖食用品，使工人在生产情绪上，不因当时的物价涨落有所波动。第二：团结了三分之一以上的基本骨干如技术工和熟练工等，并培养了积极分子，在生产中起积极作用。第三：严格纪律，奖罚分明。如揭发了采购员聂晓云的贪污事件，教育个别偷纱女工，启发了工人政治觉悟。第四：实行了三计工资制度，建立了考工制，使产量与质量都推进了一步。第五：加强青工学习，提高了生产情绪，在换班次时，工人们自动要求加工。该厂是在非常困难的条件下恢复修建起来的，目前虽已获得上面这些成绩，但还存在不少缺点：如厂内的一切制度都尚未完全趋于正轨。在生产上除着重于是质量的提高外，对各车间标准工作法尚未全部实行等均有待于改善。七月份起，全厂职工人员，正在根据工商会议的新的精神，进一步的检查全厂工作，改进过去存在着的缺点，以便使厂内的管理、制度、工资等等问题更合理化。
