Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. At the opening ceremony of the Sixth National Labor Congress, Comrade Li Lisan delivered the opening speech on behalf of the presidium. Comrade Lisan first pointed out that the past five congresses were held under the direct leadership of the Communist Party. With the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class began a truly revolutionary struggle and a revolutionary trade union movement. The First National Labor Congress, held in Guangzhou on May 1, 1922, was initiated by the China Labor Union Secretariat, the organization engaged in the workers' movement at that time under the Chinese Communist Party. The congress determined the direction of the Chinese workers' movement for unity and struggle and formally resolved to recognize the Secretariat as the overall national leading body of the workers' movement before the establishment of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people today, was one of the leaders of the Labor Union Secretariat at that time. Under the impetus and influence of the First Labor Congress, the first wave of strikes of the Chinese working class was launched. In less than a year, workers in railways, seafarers, mines, and major cities across the country held victorious strikes and established trade unions. By February 1923, the "February 7th" strike, in which railway workers across the country went on strike to support workers on the Jinghan Railway in their struggle for freedom to organize trade unions and against the oppression of the Northern Warlords, had put the Chinese working class on the political stage and demonstrated its strong fighting ability, receiving attention from all sides. From that time on, the Chinese working class became the vanguard of the national liberation movement. The Second Congress was held in Guangzhou on May 1, 1925. Comrades Su Zhaozheng and Deng Zhongxia were the leaders of this congress. The congress adopted the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and elected the executive committee of the "All-China Federation of Trade Unions." At that time, the chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was Comrade Lin Weimin, a famous leader of the Hong Kong Seamen's Strike. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, now an outstanding leader of the CCP and Chairman Mao's comrade-in-arms, was the vice-chairman at that time. The congress determined the correct direction for the Chinese working class to participate in and lead the National Revolution to oppose imperialism and feudal warlords. Shortly after the closing of the congress, the Shanghai "May 30th" General Strike, which became the starting point of the national revolutionary upsurge, was launched, marking the beginning of China's First Great Revolution. The Hong Kong General Strike, led by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for two years, can be said to be one of the most persistent strike movements in the world, becoming a pillar supporting the revolutionary government in Guangzhou at that time. The leaders of this general strike, Comrades Su Zhaozheng, Deng Zhongxia, and Li Qihan, and Comrade Zhao Shiyan, were the leaders of the Third National Labor Congress held in Guangzhou on May 1, 1926. At this congress, it was decided to call on workers across the country to actively participate in and support the upcoming Northern Expedition. The Shanghai workers' armed uprising in March 1927 in response to the Northern Expedition and the occupation of Shanghai became the first attempt by the Chinese working class to take up arms for revolutionary struggle and achieve victory.
    When the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Wuhan and the national revolutionary movement was flourishing, the Chinese big bourgeoisie, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, betrayed the revolution and launched the "April 12th" massacre against revolutionary workers in Shanghai. At that time, the workers were not vigilant against this counter-revolutionary betrayal within the revolutionary camp and suffered great losses. However, the working class was not intimidated by the "April 12th" counter-revolutionary massacre. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolution was only carried out in several southeastern provinces and Guangzhou, while the revolution in the central provinces, centered on Wuhan, continued to develop. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions had moved to Wuhan in the autumn of 1926, carrying out extensive organizational work in the provinces occupied by the Northern Expeditionary Army and launching a universal struggle to improve workers' lives, playing a significant role in supporting and assisting the Northern Expeditionary Army. At that time, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions had 2.8 million members. The Fourth National Labor Congress was held in Hankou in the summer of 1927. The congress resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal and called on workers across the country to assist the peasant movement, which was vigorously developing in the southern provinces at that time, and to continue to deepen the revolutionary struggle. However, at that time, the leading organ of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Chen Duxiu, made an opportunist error and adopted a policy of constant concession to the counter-revolutionary elements within the Wuhan government, which made the counter-revolutionary betrayal of the Wuhan government possible, and the revolution suffered great losses again. But the working class did not succumb to this, resolutely united with the broad masses of peasants and the petty bourgeoisie to continue to adhere to the revolutionary struggle. And on this day twenty-one years ago, the Nanchang Uprising was held, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army was born. Later, in December 1927, an uprising was held in Guangzhou in an attempt to save the failure of the revolution. However, after the failure in Guangzhou, the first climax of the Great Revolution in China ended in failure. The counter-revolutionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of imperialism, temporarily won the victory. From then on, the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary trade unions had to temporarily go underground.
    After the failure of the First Great Revolution, the various rights and interests that the working class had won during the Great Revolution were almost completely lost, and revolutionary workers were under white terror. However, the Fifth Labor Congress was still secretly held in Shanghai in 1929. Because the cities were the concentrated strongholds of counter-revolutionary forces, it was difficult to carry out revolutionary activities, so it called on and organized workers to go to the countryside to help the peasants—the Chinese working class's largest and most reliable revolutionary ally—organize, launch guerrilla warfare, and carry out land revolution. Because at that time, the new period of armed struggle of the peasant land revolution led by the working-class party—the Communist Party, especially led by Chairman Mao Zedong, had already begun and had achieved important results. The armed struggle with land revolution as its content persisted for ten years and crushed the Kuomintang reactionary group's four counter-revolutionary encirclements and suppressions, and had achieved greater victories and development. However, at its end, due to leadership errors and Zhang Guotao's sabotage, it suffered serious setbacks again. However, in the end, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, these errors and sabotage were overcome, and the Chinese People's Army and revolutionary cadres were preserved until the arrival of the new high tide of the national revolution in 1937. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the staff of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions had to disperse. One part led anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and this guerrilla warfare created vast liberated areas behind enemy lines, thus persisting in China's resistance and finally defeating Japanese imperialism. One part persisted in underground struggle in the enemy-occupied areas, and another part went to the Kuomintang-controlled areas to unite with the China Labor Association led by Comrade Zhu Xuefan to carry out legal movements.
    Comrade Lisan emphasized that in the nineteen years since the Fifth Labor Congress, the Chinese revolution, under the leadership of the great proletarian strategist and the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has victoriously gone through three revolutionary periods, proving that the Chinese working class has always been the vanguard and leader of the Chinese people's struggle for national independence and liberation, and is the most resolute and thorough leading class in the struggle. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, although Chinese workers were in a state of slavery without any freedom or rights, subjected to the cruel exploitation of bureaucratic capital and the combined terror rule of the US and Chiang, and were threatened by hunger and murder almost every day, they still persisted in their heroic and tenacious struggle. Taking the workers of Shanghai as an example, after the "September 18th" Incident, the great strike of 100,000 cotton mill workers in Shanghai directly promoted the "January 28th" Shanghai War of Resistance, which inspired the whole country. During the period of occupation, various anti-Japanese activities were carried out, underground workers' organizations were expanded, and when Japan surrendered, the plot of the Japanese invaders to burn down Shanghai factories was thwarted. Later, under the high pressure of the Kuomintang reactionary group, many strikes were carried out to save lives and seek survival. The workers' struggles in other places have not stopped in the past nineteen years. For example, last year alone, it is estimated that 3.2 million people participated in strikes. Especially the strike of the Shanghai Shenxin Cotton Mill workers in February this year, in which more than 100 people were killed and injured under the massacre of the Kuomintang reactionaries' tanks and machine guns, showed that the heroic tradition of the Shanghai workers' revolutionary struggle is still maintained today. Today, workers' representatives from Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Tangshan, Guangzhou, and other major cities have been able to break through the Kuomintang's white terror to attend this congress, which shows that the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese workers united under the banner of Mao Zedong is irresistible. Workers in the liberated areas have not only gained all democratic rights and realized the goals that the working class has been striving for for decades, but have also participated in the people's regime and become the leading class of the people's regime. Economically, they have not only been freed from the exploitation of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, but have also participated in economic management. Many old pioneers of the workers' movement and many newly rising labor heroes, such as Comrades Zhao Zhankui and Liu Yingyuan, have now become leaders of state-owned enterprises. Workers are already the masters of factories and enterprises, and the exploitation of private capital has also been appropriately restricted. In terms of cultural education, workers are not only not excluded or restricted in any way, but the government has also specially provided various cultural and educational facilities for workers, and the talents of workers may no longer be buried. The working class in the liberated areas has already enabled all oppressed people to become the true masters of the country and society. Now the population of the Chinese liberated areas is already larger than that of the United States. Our ability to hold the Sixth National Labor Congress on free land is the fruit of decades of bloody struggle by the Chinese working class, peasants, and other revolutionary people, especially the fruit created by the sacrifice and bloodshed of the People's Liberation Army, the sons and daughters of workers, peasants, and other working people. Comrade Li Lisan said that on behalf of the workers across the country, we express our condolences to Comrades Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, Zhao Shiyan, Deng Zhongxia, Li Qihan, Xu Baihao, Guo Liang, Liu Hua, Luo Yinong, Wang Shouhua, Wang Hebo, Zhang Tailei, Su Zhaozheng, Xiang Ying, Luo Dengxian, Yang Yin, Deng Fa, Zhang Hao, Zhu Baoting, and other outstanding martyrs of the working class who heroically sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle of the working class over the past decades, and to the fallen soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who heroically sacrificed themselves for the cause of liberation of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people over the past twenty years. Comrade Lisan then pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has turned to a full-scale offensive, has become an invincible and powerful revolutionary armed force that will finally liberate the whole of China; we, on behalf of the workers across the country, pay our respects to Commander-in-Chief Zhu! Pay our respects to all the commanders and fighters who are victoriously attacking on various fronts! Comrade Lisan especially pointed out that the most important and most fundamental reason for this victory is due to the leadership of the Chinese working class and its party—the Chinese Communist Party, and the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. With Chairman Mao Zedong at the helm, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people will surely achieve the final victory of liberation. Therefore, the Sixth National Labor Congress, on behalf of the working class across the country, pays its respects to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China! Pay our respects to Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the working class and the Chinese people! Finally, Comrade Lisan pointed out that the cause of national liberation in China has been assisted by workers from all over the world, especially the people of the Soviet Union, from the very beginning. Especially the great achievements of the Soviet Red Army in crushing the brutal Japanese army, directly liberating the Northeast, and quickly liberating the Chinese people from the oppression of the Japanese invaders. Today, international imperialism is carrying out conspiracies to undermine world peace and world democracy. Only by uniting workers all over the world and all democrats can we defeat the international reactionary forces and war-mongers headed by the United States. Therefore, the Sixth National Labor Congress, on behalf of the Chinese working class, pays its respects to the leader of the Soviet people and the world's workers' mentor, Marshal Stalin! At this point, cheers and shouts of "Long live!" shook the house, and the Internationale followed. Comrade Li Lisan finally pointed out: The main task of this congress is to discuss how to further consolidate and expand the unity of the working class and unite with the people of all democratic strata in the country to exert the greater combat power of the Chinese people, completely smash the counter-revolutionary army and counter-revolutionary regime of the Kuomintang reactionary group, and establish the independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous New China pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong.

　　在第六次全国劳动大会上
  　李立三同志致开幕词
    【新华社东北七日电】第六次全国劳动大会开幕典礼时，李立三同志代表主席团致开幕词，立三同志首先指出：过去五次大会，都是在共产党直接领导下举行的。有了中国共产党，中国工人阶级就开始了真正革命的斗争和革命的职工运动。一九二二年五月一日在广州举行的第一次全国劳动大会，就是由中国共产党当时从事工人运动的组织——中国劳动组合书记部所发起。当时大会确定了中国工人运动统一团结的斗争方向，并正式决议承认书记部为全国总工会成立以前的工人运动的全国总的领导机关，今日中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席，就是当时劳动组合书记部的领导者之一。在第一次劳动大会的推动和影响之下，开展了中国工人阶级第一次的罢工斗争高潮，在不到一年的时间，全国铁路、海员、矿山及全国各大城市的工人，差不多都举行过胜利的罢工，并成立了工会。至一九二三年二月全国铁路工人为援助京汉铁路工人为争取组织工会的自由，反对当时北洋军阀的压迫而举行的“二七”大罢工，已使中国工人阶级登上了政治舞台，并表示了自己坚强的斗争能力，受到各方面的重视。从那时起，中国工人阶级已成为全国人民解放运动的先锋队。第二次大会是一九二五年五月一日在广州举行的，苏兆征、邓中夏等同志即是这次大会的领导者，会上通过了中华全国总工会章程，选举了“中华全国总工会”的执行委员会。当时总工会的委员长是香港海员大罢工的著名领导者林伟民同志，现在中共卓越的领导者，毛主席的战友刘少奇同志，就是当时的副委员长。大会确定了中国工人阶级应当参加和领导国民革命，以反对帝国主义和封建军阀的正确方向。在大会闭幕不久，就掀起了成为全国革命高潮起点的上海“五卅”总罢工，开始了中国第一次大革命。而当时在全总领导下坚持了两年之久的香港大罢工，可以说是世界上最持久的罢工运动之一，成为支援当时广州革命政府的支柱。这次大罢工的领袖苏兆征、邓中夏、李启汉诸同志，及赵世炎同志就是一九二六年五月一日在广州举行的第三次全国劳动大会的领导者。在这次大会上决定了号召全国工人积极参加和支援快要举行的北伐战争。上海工人在一九二七年三月为响应北伐军而举行的武装起义，并占领上海的壮举，成为中国工人阶级拿起武器进行革命斗争而且获得了胜利的首次尝试。
    在北伐军打到武汉，全国革命运动正蓬勃发展之时，以蒋介石为首的中国大资产阶级叛变了革命，首先在上海对革命工人举行了“四一二”大屠杀。当时工人没有警惕革命阵营内部这种反革命叛变，受到了很大损失。但工人阶级并没有被“四一二”的反革命大屠杀所骇倒。当时蒋介石的反革命，还只在东南数省及广州等地进行，而以武汉为中心的中部各省，革命仍在继续发展中。全国总工会在一九二六年秋季已迁至武汉，在北伐军占领的各省，进行极大的组织工作，并举行了改善工人生活的普遍的斗争，对于北伐军的支援和帮助，起了极大的作用。当时组织在全国总工会之内的有二百八十万会员。至一九二七年夏季在汉口举行了第四次全国劳动大会。会上坚决地反对了蒋介石的叛变，并号召全国工人援助当时正在南方各省蓬勃开展的农民运动，继续深入展开革命斗争。但是当时由于中国共产党的领导机关以陈独秀为首，犯了机会主义的错误，对于武汉政府内部的反革命分子采取一直退让的政策，因而使武汉政府的反革命叛变成为可能，革命又受到了极大的损失。但工人阶级并未因而屈服，坚决联合广大农民和小资产阶级继续坚持了革命斗争。并在二十一年前的今天，举行了南昌起义，中国人民解放军从此诞生。以后，一九二七年十二月又在广州举行了起义，试图挽救革命的失败。但从广州失败以后，中国第一次大革命高潮，即以失败的结局而终结，以蒋介石为首的反革命集团在帝国主义帮助之下，暂时地得到了胜利，从此，中国共产党及革命职工会不得不暂时转入地下活动。
    在第一次大革命失败以后，工人阶级在大革命时期所争得的各种权利和利益，差不多完全丧失，革命的工人则处于白色恐怖之下，但在一九二九年仍然在上海秘密举行了第五次劳动大会。由于城市是反革命力量集中的据点，很难进行革命活动，乃号召和组织工人下乡，以便帮助农民——中国工人阶级最广大最可靠的革命同盟军组织起来，发动游击战争和土地革命。因为在当时以工人阶级的政党——共产党为领导的特别是以毛泽东主席为领导的农民土地革命的武装斗争的新时期已经开始，并已获得了重要的效果。以土地革命为内容的武装斗争，坚持了十年之久，并粉碎了国民党反动集团的四次反革命围剿，曾经得到更大的胜利和发展，但在它的末期，又由于领导上的错误与张国焘的破坏，又受到严重的挫折，然而在最后，仍在毛泽东主席领导之下克服了这种错误与破坏，方得保存中国人民军队及革命干部，到一九三七年新的民族革命运动高潮时期的到来。在抗日时期，中华全国总工会的工作人员曾经不得不分散，一部分在敌后领导抗日游击战争，这种游击战争创造了敌后广大的解放区，因而坚持了中国的抗战，以至最后战胜了日本帝国主义。一部分则在敌占区坚持地下斗争，再一部分则到国民党统治区与朱学范同志领导的中国劳动协会联合，进行合法运动。
    立三同志着重指出：从第五次劳动大会以来的十九年中，中国革命在无产阶级伟大战略家和中国人民领袖毛泽东主席领导下，胜利的经过了三个革命时期，证明了中国工人阶级始终是中国人民争取民族独立解放斗争的先锋队和领导者，是在斗争中最坚决最彻底的领导阶级。在国民党统治区，中国工人虽然处在毫无自由与权利的奴隶地位，受着官僚资本的残酷剥削和美蒋联合的恐怖统治，几乎每天都受到饥饿和杀害的威胁，但他们仍然坚持着英勇顽强的斗争。以上海的工人为例来说，在“九一八”事变后，上海十万纱厂工人的大罢工，曾经直接推动了振奋全国的“一二八”上海抗战。在沦陷期间，又进行了各种抗日活动，扩大了地下的工人组织，在日本投降时，粉碎了日寇烧毁上海工厂的阴谋企图，后来，又在国民党反动集团的高压下，为救死求生，进行了很多罢工斗争。其他各地的工人斗争，十九年来也没有停止过。如去年一年，据统计参加罢工的人数就达三百廿万人。特别是今年二月间上海申新纱厂工人的罢工，在国民党反动派的坦克、机枪的屠杀下，死伤一百多人之多，表现了上海工人革命斗争的英勇传统至今是仍然保持着的。今天上海、天津、武汉、唐山、广州及其他各大城市的工人代表能够冲破国民党的白色恐怖，来出席这次大会，说明了中国工人团结在毛泽东旗帜下的革命斗争是不可抗拒的。解放区工人则不仅已经获得了一切民主权利，实现了工人阶级几十年奋斗所要求的目的，而且参加了人民政权，成了人民政权的领导阶级。在经济上不但解除了帝国主义和官僚资本的剥削，而且参加了经济管理，许多工人运动的老前辈和新起的许多劳动英雄，如赵占魁、刘英源同志等，现在成了国营企业的领导者，工人已经是工厂和企业的主人翁，私人资本的剥削也已受到适当的限制。工人在文化教育方面，不但不受任何的排斥和限制，而且政府特为工人进行各种文化教育的设施，工人中的天才可能不再受埋没了。解放区工人阶级已经使一切被压迫人民一起成为国家的、社会的真正主人翁了。现在中国解放区的人口，已比美国还多了。我们能够在自由的土地上，举行第六次全国劳动大会，乃是中国工人阶级和农民及其他革命人民几十年流血斗争所取得的果实，特别是工人农民及其他劳动人民的子弟兵——人民解放军牺牲流血所创造的果实。李立三同志说，我们代表全国工人，向数十年来在工人阶级革命斗争中英勇牺牲的林祥谦同志、施洋同志、赵世炎同志、邓中夏同志、李启汉同志、许白昊同志、郭亮同志、刘华同志、罗亦农同志、汪寿华同志、王荷波同志、张太雷同志、苏兆征同志、项英同志、罗登贤同志、杨殷同志、邓发同志、张浩同志、朱宝庭同志及其他工人阶级优秀烈士致哀，向廿年来为中国工人阶级及中国人民解放事业而英勇牺牲的中国人民解放军诸阵亡将士致哀。立三同志接着指出：转入全面进攻的中国人民解放军，已经成为无坚不摧的最后解放全中国的强大的革命武装力量；我们代表全国工人向朱总司令致敬！向正在各个前线胜利进攻的全体指战员致敬！立三同志特别指出这个胜利最主要和最基本的原因，是由于中国工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党的领导，乃是毛泽东主席的领导，有了毛主席掌舵，中国工人阶级和中国人民一定会得到最后解放的胜利。因此第六次全国劳动大会代表全国工人阶级向中共中央致敬！向工人阶级及中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席致敬！最后，立三同志指出中国民族的解放事业，一开始就得到世界各国工人，特别是苏联人民的援助，特别是苏联红军粉碎暴日的伟绩，直接解放了东北，并使中国人民从日寇压迫下迅速获得解放。今天国际帝国主义正在进行破坏世界和平与世界民主的阴谋活动，只有全世界工人及一切民主人士团结起来，才能战胜以美国为首的国际反动势力和战争贩子，因此第六次全国劳动大会代表中国工人阶级，向苏联人民领袖，世界工人导师斯大林大元帅致敬！会场至此欢呼不绝，万岁声、欢呼声震撼屋宇，国际歌声随之而起。李立三同志最后指出：此次大会的主要任务，就是讨论如何进一步的巩固和扩大工人阶级的团结，并联合全国各个民主阶层人民，发挥中国人民更伟大的战斗力，彻底粉碎国民党反动集团的反革命军队及反革命政权，建立毛泽东主席所指出的，独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国。
