    The rapid development of the labor movement in postwar Japan demonstrates the unprecedented growth of the Japanese working class's consciousness and organizational strength.

    At the end of 1936, there were only 973 labor unions in Japan, with a total of 420,000 organized workers, accounting for only 7% of the total number of workers. Moreover, 70% of the unions were controlled by right-wing leaders. However, in the three years since the war, the face of the Japanese labor movement has completely changed; the working class has become the main force and vanguard of the people's democratic struggle. By the end of February 1946, the total number of labor unions in Japan was only 1,320, with only 877,000 participants. By May of the same year, the number of organized workers suddenly increased to 2 million, and by the end of the year, it increased to 4.4 million. In May 1947, it further increased to 5.5 million, and in June 1948, it increased to 6.5 million. (The total number of workers in Japan is about 10 million), and labor organizations also surged to 30,000.

    The two largest labor unions in Japan are the left-wing "National Congress of Industrial Unions" (abbreviated as San-Betzu) and the right-wing "Japanese Federation of Trade Unions" (abbreviated as So-Domei). San-Betzu was formally established in August 1946, with more than 1.6 million participants at the time. To date, San-Betzu has doubled in size, with approximately 3 million members. Before the war, the leaders of So-Domei were social-fascist elements serving the military. After the war, So-Domei became the main base of the Socialist Party. So-Domei has only 1.5 million members.

    The rapid leftward shift of the Japanese working class and the growth of the Japanese Communist Party's influence in the labor unions are the main characteristics of the postwar Japanese labor movement. At the San-Betzu congress held last November, 25 of the 49 newly elected executive committee members were Communists. The chairman of San-Betzu, Katsumi Kikunami, joined the Japanese Communist Party in the autumn of 1947. A powerful union under the San-Betzu system—the National Communication Workers' Union, with 400,000 members—elected a board where JCP members and left-wing leaders accounted for 56% of the seats, centrists for 33%, and right-wingers for only 11% in the executive committee election at the end of June this year. Two of the three vice-chairmen are Communists. The influence of the Japanese Communist Party has also extended to independent unions and some unions under the So-Domei system. The largest independent union in Japan—the National Railway Workers' Union, with 540,000 members—was originally controlled by socialists, but in the executive committee election at the end of May this year, Japanese Communist Party members and left-wing leaders were elected to 19 seats, while right-wing socialists and their followers were elected to only 15 seats. The chairman is a centrist, and the vice-chairman is a Communist. In strike struggles, San-Betzu also often unites with independent unions to conduct struggles, and some local unions within the So-Domei system also frequently defy the intentions of their central leadership organs and take concerted action with local San-Betzu unions. Although MacArthur and the Japanese reactionary government have tried every means to attack the Japanese Communist Party and use the Socialist Party to split the Japanese working class, they still cannot prevent the growth of the Japanese Communist Party's prestige and the trend towards unity of the Japanese working class.

    The scale of Japanese workers' strikes after the war is also unprecedented. The struggle against hunger and demanding wage increases is often combined with the struggle against the reactionary government, with hundreds of thousands to millions of workers involved in the struggle. The anti-hunger demonstration of more than 2 million Japanese workers planned in May 1946, the general strike of 6 million people in February 1947, and the even larger-scale general strike in March this year, although all were banned by MacArthur's orders, all demonstrate the power of the Japanese working class.

### 日本工运的发展

    日本工运的发展
    战后日本劳工运动的迅速发展，显示了日本工人阶级的觉悟与组织力量之空前增长。
    在一九三六年末，日本的工会不过九百七十三个，有组织的工人总共四十二万，仅占工人总数百分之七，而且百分之七十的工会，是控制在右派领袖手中。但在战后三年以来，日本职工运动的面貌已完全改观；工人阶级已经成为人民民主斗争的主力军和先锋队了。迄至一九四六年二月末为止，日本全国工会总数还不过一千三百二十个，参加者不过八十七万七千人。及是年五月，有组织的工人突增至二百万，年底又增至四百四十万。一九四七年五月更增至五百五十万，而一九四八年六月则增至六百五十万人。（日本工人总数约为一千万），劳工团体亦激增至三万。
    日本最大的两个工会，是左翼的“产业劳动组合联合会”（简称产联），和右翼的“劳动组合总同盟”（简称总同盟）。产联正式成立于一九四六年八月，当时参加人数在一百六十万以上。迄今为止，产联已经壮大了一倍，拥有三百万左右的会员。战前，总同盟的领袖是军部御用的社会党法西斯分子。战后，总同盟成为社会党的主要地盘。总同盟的会员仅一百五十万人。
    日本工人阶级的迅速左倾与日共对于工会影响之增长，是战后日本工运的主要特点。去年十一月举行的产联大会上，新选出的四十九名执委当中，有二十五名是共产党员，产联主席听涛克已于一九四七年秋参加日共。产联系统下面的一个强大工会——拥有四十万会员的全国递信工人工会，在今年六月末的执委会选举中，日共党员及左派领袖占了百分之五十六，中间派占百分之三十三，右派只占百分之十一，三名副主席中两名是共产党员。日共的影响，也扩及于独立的工会和总同盟系统下的若干工会。日本最大的一个独立工会——拥有五十四万会员的国营铁道工人工会，原为社会党人所控制，但在今年五月末的执委会选举中，日共党员和左派领袖当选了十九名，右翼社会党人及其追随者只当选了十五名，主席是中间分子，副主席是共产党员。在罢工斗争当中，产联也经常联合独立的工会进行斗争，而总同盟系统的若干地方工会，也经常违抗其中央领导机关的意旨，和产联的地方工会采取一致行动。麦克阿瑟和日本反动政府虽曾千方百计地来打击日共并利用社会党以分裂日本的工人阶级，但仍不能阻止日共威信的增长和日本工人阶级团结的趋向。
    战后日本工人罢工的规模也是空前的。反饥饿与要求增资的斗争，常常与反对反动政府的斗争相结合，动辄数十万到百万的工人卷入了斗争浪潮。一九四六年五月日本工人所准备的二百余万人的反饥饿示威，一九四七年二月六百万人的总罢工，以及今年三月更大规模的总罢工，虽然都被麦克阿瑟下令禁止，但都说明了日本工人阶级力量的强大。【新华社陕北四日电】
