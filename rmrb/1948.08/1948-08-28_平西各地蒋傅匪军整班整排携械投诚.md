【Chahar News】Due to the great victories of our People's Liberation Army on various battlefields and the continuous development of political offensives, and also because our Party, government, army, and people correctly grasp the Party's lenient policy and the policy towards captives, the internal contradictions within the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops have deepened. Increasingly, soldiers or lower-ranking officers of the bandit troops are surrendering en masse, by squads and platoons, carrying their weapons. The North Yue Third Military Sub-district has taken in 1,118 Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits in the first half of this year, of which 998 defected and surrendered, bringing with them three light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, two submachine guns, one pistol, 58 rifles, 6,181 rounds of ammunition, 16 war horses, and a portion of other military supplies. Li Maocai organized and led 16 men from the third platoon of the fifth company of the second battalion of the 6th Regiment of the 94th Division of the 16th Army, stationed at Shahe Station on the Ping-Sui Railway, to revolt on June 18, bringing with them two light machine guns and two submachine guns. Yu Hai, an artilleryman from the first company of the first battalion of the 426th Regiment of the 124th Division of the 92nd Army, got his entire squad drunk with wine on the night of May 11 and carried a US-made 60mm mortar to surrender. Two squads from the second company of the Fu Bandit 12th Cavalry Brigade stationed in Wanping surrendered with full equipment. In the past six months, the number of lower-ranking officers who have deserted includes one company commander, two platoon leaders, and nine squad leaders.
