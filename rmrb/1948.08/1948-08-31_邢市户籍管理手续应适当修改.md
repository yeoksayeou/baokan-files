　　Xing City Household Registration Management Procedures Should Be Appropriately Revised
    Editor:
    I have an opinion regarding the household registration management in Xingtai City. According to the Border Region Government's order, the road pass system in the consolidated areas has been abolished, granting merchants and residents the freedom to move for trade. The merchants and residents are very supportive of this. However, the household registration procedures in our city are too cumbersome. Whenever shop personnel leave for business, the household registration office must be notified immediately. Failure to do so will cause trouble during household registration checks. For moving out household registrations, a certificate of proof is required from the village cadre of the person's original village, along with the shop manager's seal. Otherwise, the household registration cannot be cleared. Registering to move in is even more difficult. If one wants to open a shop in the city, a letter of introduction from the village is required when registering the household, and even a district introduction. If the village cadre dislikes you, they won't write the letter of introduction. It's very difficult to come to Xingtai City to do business. In the past, having a shop guarantor was enough to register a household. Now, the movements of merchants are entirely dependent on the village cadre's letters of introduction. I think this is detrimental to the development of industry and commerce. Could it be revised?　　　　　　　　　　　    　　Xing City Li Yawen
    It should be appropriately revised according to the principle of benefiting the people and facilitating commerce.                    ——Editor

　　邢市户籍管理手续应适当修改
    编辑同志：
    我对于邢台市之户籍管理有个意见。根据边府命令，取消巩固区路条制度，使商民有贸易行动迁移之自由。商民很拥护，但本市之户籍手续太繁多，出入商铺人员因事外出，得立即通知户籍室。如不通知，查户口就得麻烦。迁出户口，必须有迁出人本村村干部来证明信，还得本号经理盖章。否则户口不能办清。迁入者更难，若想在市内开设一个商铺，报户口时必须要村的介绍信，更要区的介绍后，如果村干对你不好，就不给写介绍信。想来邢台市做点商业，难得很。过去有铺保就能报户口，现在商人的行动完全归到村干部介绍信了。我想这样对发展工商业是不利的，是否能修改呢？　　　　　　　　　　　    　邢市李亚文
