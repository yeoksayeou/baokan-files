　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. TASS Berlin dispatch: The Soviet Military Administration announced on the 18th that all citizens in the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin, as well as citizens in the Western-occupied sector who have registered their ration cards in the Soviet-occupied sector, will receive an additional one kilogram of flour per person in August, in addition to the regularly allocated rations. In response to the requests from various democratic parties in Berlin for coal allocation to help Berlin citizens prepare for winter, the Soviet Military Administration has decided to allocate the first batch of 60,000 tons of coal to the citizens of Berlin, allowing each family to have a coal stockpile. The citizens of Berlin unanimously expressed satisfaction after the Soviet order was announced. Deutsche Nachrichten believes that this is another proof of the Soviet Military Administration actively fulfilling its promise to supply Berlin. It is reported that since the Western authorities implemented the reactionary currency reform policy to increase exploitation of the German people, 300 bakeries in the western sector of Berlin have been forced to suspend operations due to a shortage of coal and electricity.

　　苏联积极履行诺言
  　供给柏林市民煤炭
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社柏林讯：苏联军政府十八日宣布：所有柏林苏占区市民及曾在苏占区登记其口粮证之西占区市民，除已规定之口粮照常配给外，并在八月份内，每人增发面粉一公斤。由于柏林各民主政党要求配给煤炭作柏林市民准备过冬之用，苏军政府已决定拨付第一批煤炭六万吨供给柏林市民，使每一家庭得有煤炭储存。苏方命令宣布后，柏林市民均一致表示满意。德意志新闻认为这是苏军政府积极履行其供应柏林诺言之又一证明。按自西方当局实行反动货币改革政策以增加对德人民之剥削以来，柏林西区面包工厂，因煤电缺乏而停工者已达三百家。
