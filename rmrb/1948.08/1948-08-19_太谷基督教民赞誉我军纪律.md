(Taihang Electric) Wang Ying, the principal of Beilu Elementary School and one of the heads of the Christian Management Association in Taigu's Nanda Street, accused Yan's bandits of devastating the church. He stated that in August of the 1934th year of the Republic of China [1945], after Yan Xishan surrendered to Japan and returned to Taiyuan, his First Administrative Office forcibly occupied the association's building. That winter, the weather was severely cold, and Yan's bandit officials actually lit fires on the floor of the building for warmth, causing a fire that completely destroyed the three-story building with over fifty rooms, as well as all the equipment and belongings inside. Zhang Yishan, the director of the Eighth District Leadership Group of Yan's bandits, not only did not provide any compensation but also ordered the association not to reveal the truth of the matter. If anyone inquired, they were to attribute it to the Japanese. For three years, all the association's properties have been frequently seized and looted. Although the church members were very resentful, they were helpless. After our liberation of Taigu, the democratic government immediately announced to the military and civilians of the city that churches would be strictly protected, and the association suffered no damage whatsoever. Principal Wang was deeply moved by this and praised our army for its strict discipline and good order. He said: Since the People's Liberation Army entered the city, no one has been stationed in the church. Some personnel who came to visit were extremely polite and showed respect for the church's rules and customs everywhere, proving them to be a benevolent and righteous army. Now the association has resumed worship and is chanting scriptures as usual. The church members have generally reflected that they have complete freedom after liberation, which is completely different from when Yan San [Yan Xishan] was in power. Gathering to chant scriptures is no longer threatened by accusations of "conspiring rebellion" and "pretense."

　　太谷基督教民赞誉我军纪律
    【太行电】太谷城内南大街基督教人管理会负责人之一贝露小学校长王瀛控诉阎匪摧残教会情形称：民国三十四年八月，阎锡山投降日本，重返太原，其第一行政专署即强占本会大楼。是年冬天气候严寒，阎匪官员竟在大楼地板上燃火取暖，致成火灾，将三层高楼五十余间房屋，及房内一切用具财物完全烧毁。阎匪第八区领导组主任张亦山不仅未予任何赔偿，反命令本会不准暴露此事真象，如有人询问，应推为日人烧毁。三年来本会所有财物常遭霸占抢的，教会同人虽十分愤恨，但亦无可如何。我解放太谷后，民主政府即布告全城军民，严格保护教会，该会未受丝毫损伤。王校长对此深为感动，盛赞我军纪律严明，秩序良好。他说：解放军进城以来，从无人驻扎教会，来此参观的一些人员极为礼貌，对本会教规及教民习俗亦处处尊重，可为仁义之师。现该会已恢复礼拜，照常诵经。教民纷纷反映解放后十分自由，和阎三在时完全不同，集合诵经再不受“阴谋叛乱”及“伪装”的威胁了。
