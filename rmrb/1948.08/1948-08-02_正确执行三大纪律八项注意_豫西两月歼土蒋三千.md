Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan, 30th. The basic armed forces of a certain sub-district in western Henan, in the course of suppressing local bandits and Chiang's troops in the Funiu Mountains, correctly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, enabling the suppression to achieve significant results. In the past two months, they have annihilated more than 3,000 bandits and members of the Kuomintang's "Funiu Mountain Bandit Elimination General Corps" led by Li Hanwen, Li Hansan, Xiao Chengwei, Xiao Chengbo, and others, as well as local reactionary militia from Luoning, Songxian, Yiyang, and Yiyang counties. The local bandits in the above counties have now been largely eliminated.

Our forces engaged in bandit suppression in the Funiu Mountains each carried five days' worth of grain. At the same time, grain transport stations were established throughout the mountainous areas from the eastern foothills of the Funiu Mountains, with 10% of the transported grain paid to the masses who helped our army transport the grain, ensuring the supply of the troops and solving the spring famine difficulties of the mountain people. Under any difficult circumstances, the troops resolutely observed the rules of discipline regarding the masses. For example, when a certain unit entered the Checun area, the grain had not yet arrived, and although the soldiers endured hunger and braved the wind and rain to continue fighting, they still did not take a single thing from the masses, which made the local people deeply aware of the strict discipline of our army. The masses who had been threatened and deceived by Chiang's bandits and had fled, therefore returned home with peace of mind. Several small groups of bandits, under the influence of our army's policy of not killing those who surrendered their weapons and guaranteeing a secure livelihood, and with the assistance of the local masses, surrendered their weapons one after another and returned home to production. In Checun and Huangcun villages alone, more than 170 people returned.

    正确执行三大纪律八项注意
    豫西两月歼土蒋三千
    【新华社豫西三十日电】豫西我某分区基干武装，于清剿伏牛山区土蒋中，正确执行三大纪律八项注意，使清剿获得重大成果。两月来共歼土蒋“伏牛山除暴总团”李汉文、李汉三、萧成为、萧澄波等匪，及洛宁、嵩县、伊阳、宜阳等县还乡团三千余人。以上各县土蒋，现已大部肃清。
    我克山清剿部队，每人均自背五日粮食。同时从伏牛山东麓各县到山区腹地，遍设粮食运动站，以所运粮食百分之十偿付帮助我军运粮的群众，使部队供应无虞，并解决了山区群众春荒困难。在任何困难情况下，部队都坚决遵守群众纪律。如某部于进入车村地区时，粮食没有运到，战士们虽忍受饥饿，冒着风雨，继续作战，仍不动群众一点东西，使该地群众深刻认识我军纪律严明。曾受蒋匪恐吓、欺骗而出走的群众，因而纷纷安心回家。若干小股土蒋亦在我军缴枪不杀、保证安业的宽大政策影响下，并在当地群众协助争取下，纷纷缴械，回家生产。仅车村、黄村两村，来归者即达一百七十余人。
