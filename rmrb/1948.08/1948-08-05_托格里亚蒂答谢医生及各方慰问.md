Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. TASS reports: Italian Communist leader Togliatti published his first statement since his injury in Unità on July 30th, saying: "I must first thank Professor Valdonio, who performed the surgery, and Professor Frugoni, who treated me. I know that without the help of these two great Italian scientists, my life would probably have been lost. Along with them, I would also like to thank all the doctors and assistants, clinical attendants and nurses, and all those in Italy and abroad who have expressed their care, condolences and blessings to me. I am not yet strong enough, but the danger has passed, and I can assure all my comrades that in due course I will be able to resume my duties."

    托格里亚蒂答谢医生及各方慰问
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社报导：意共领袖托格里亚蒂于七月三十日在团结报上发表其受伤后之首次声明说：“我首先得感谢施行手术的瓦尔东尼教授和为我医疗的弗鲁刚尼教授。我知道，要没有这两位伟大的意大利科学家之助，我的生命恐已不救。和他们一起，我还要感谢一切医生和助手，临床侍者和护士，以及意大利国内外向我表示爱护、慰问及祝福的人们。我尚不够强壮，但危险已过，我可以向我全体同志保证，在相当时期内，我将能够重行恢复我的职责”。
