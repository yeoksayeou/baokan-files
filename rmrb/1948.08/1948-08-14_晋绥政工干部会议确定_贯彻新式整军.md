　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Telegram: The Political Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region convened a political work cadre meeting of various sub-districts in May. It was determined that strengthening policy education, carrying out the democratic movement, and strengthening party work are the three central tasks for implementing the new style of military consolidation movement in the current political work of the troops. Regarding the issue of strengthening policy education, it was decided to resolutely eliminate various erroneous phenomena in the troops that violate the Party's urban policy, industrial and commercial policy, and prisoner of war policy. The meeting decided that all cadres above the battalion level in the entire army must study the documents of the Party Central Committee, and the regiment or brigade should regularly convene meetings of cadres above the battalion level to conduct criticism and self-criticism in connection with specific work. Company and platoon cadres should be organized by the regiment to report on policy issues. Soldiers should take policy classes in companies or battalions and use various times to explain policies. However, the main link is to strengthen cadre education and eliminate indiscipline and anarchic state. The meeting particularly pointed out the importance of reading the Party newspaper; in the past, many cadres were perfunctory in reading the newspaper, and they did not study the news published in the newspaper on policy issues, which was one of the root causes of violating policies. In the future, it is necessary to seriously read the newspaper so that the newspaper can become a powerful weapon for educating cadres and guiding work.
    Regarding the issue of carrying out the democratic movement in the troops, the main task is to establish soldiers' committees. The primary task of the committee is to mobilize soldiers, ensure that the troops implement the Party's policies, and oppose the remnants of warlordism. The leaders of the troops and political organs should conduct policy education and democratic education to the troops through the soldiers' committees and soldiers' congresses. All political, military, and economic democratic movements can be promoted by the soldiers' committees. However, the democratic movement must be carried out in an organized, led, and step-by-step manner. First of all, persuade cadres to dare to let go and mobilize soldiers' democracy, so that they can dispel their concerns and dare to self-criticize. The establishment of the soldiers' committee must be fully discussed among the cadres, and after mobilizing the troops to complain about suffering and conduct the "three check-ups," raising the troops' class consciousness, and conducting extensive and in-depth democratic education, it shall be elected by a secret ballot at the company-level soldiers' congress. The committee shall establish a chairman and economic, cultural, merit, mutual assistance, and other members according to actual needs. The committee shall carry out its work under the leadership of the leaders of the troops and the branch.
    Regarding the issue of strengthening party work, it is to publicize the branch and party members, and launch the "three evaluations" movement of soldiers evaluating party members, evaluating cadres, and evaluating work, so that soldiers can understand the party, recognize the party, and strengthen the connection between the party and the masses. Non-Party soldiers can be invited to participate in branch meetings to solicit their opinions and carry out internal party criticism to correct the work style of party members and overcome the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses.

　　晋绥政工干部会议确定
  　贯彻新式整军
    【新华社晋绥电】晋绥军区政治部于五月召开各分区政工干部会议。确定以加强政策教育，开展民主运动，加强党的工作为当前部队政治工作中贯彻新式整军运动的三大中心任务。关于加强政策教育问题，决定坚决肃清部队中违反党的城市政策、工商业政策、俘虏政策各种错误现象。会议决定全军营以上干部必须学习党中央的文件，并由团或旅定期召集营以上干部会议，联系具体工作进行批评与自我批评。连排干部则以团为单位组织政策问题的报告。战士以连或营为单位，上政策课，并利用各种时间讲解政策。但主要一环是加强干部教育，消灭无纪律、无政府状态。会议中特别指出阅读党报的重要；过去许多干部看报马马虎虎，对报上发表的有关政策问题的消息不加研究，乃是违犯政策的根源之一。今后须认真读报，使报纸成为教育干部与指导工作的有力武器。
    关于开展部队民主运动问题，主要是建立士兵委员会。该会的首要任务是发动战士，保证部队执行党的政策和反对军阀主义残余。部队首长和政治机关，则通过士兵委员会和军人大会对部队进行政策教育和民主教育。凡政治民主军事民主经济民主运动，都可由士兵委员会推动。但民主运动必须有组织、有领导、有步骤的进行。首先说服干部敢于放手发动士兵民主，使他们解除顾虑，勇于自我批评。士兵委员会的成立，须于干部中酝酿成熟，并在部队中发动诉苦和三查，提高部队阶级觉悟，进行广泛、深入民主教育之后由连队军人大会无记名投票选出。委员会按实际需要设立主席及经济文化立功互助等委员。委员会在部队首长及支部领导下进行工作。
    关于加强党的工作问题，就是公开支部和党员，发动战士进行评党员、评干部、评工作的三评运动，使战士了解党，认识党，密切党与群众的联系。支部开会，可邀请非党员战士参加，征求他们的意见，开展党内批评，以改正党员作风，克服脱离群众的现象。
