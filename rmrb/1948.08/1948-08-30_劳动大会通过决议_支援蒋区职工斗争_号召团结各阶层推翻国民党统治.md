　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: At the Labor Congress on the 17th, Comrade Li Lisan, on behalf of the presidium, read out the draft resolution of the Congress on the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The entire hall applauded enthusiastically and unanimously passed it. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

　　Resolution on the Report on the Workers' Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas

　　After listening to the reports by Comrades Zhu Xuefan and Ouyang Zurun (representatives from Shanghai) on the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the Congress expresses its infinite indignation at the oppressive measures of the Kuomintang government in persecuting workers and all democrats, the insidious and brutal policies of special agents, and the aggressive policies of American imperialism in supporting the Kuomintang in carrying out the civil war, massacring the Chinese people, especially in encroaching upon Chinese sovereignty and endangering the independent survival of the Chinese nation. The Congress calls on workers across the country to unite more closely, unite with all democratic classes in the country, and use all possible means to support the People's Liberation War in order to achieve the goal of quickly overthrowing Kuomintang rule and liberating all Chinese workers and all oppressed people.

　　The Congress expresses its satisfaction with the hard work of the China Labor Association, the Shanghai Workers' Association, and other democratic labor unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in uniting all workers and leading them to fight for national liberation and their own liberation during the War of Resistance and in the past two years, and hopes that they will continue their efforts in accordance with the principles determined by this Labor Congress. The pseudo-General Labor Union, organized by the Kuomintang through some traitorous special agent leaders, specializes in undermining the workers' movement and suppressing workers' struggles and is truly an enemy of the working class. The Congress calls on workers across the country to unanimously denounce it.

　　The Congress expresses its infinite sympathy and respect for the heroic struggles of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas against oppression, against hunger, for freedom, for democracy, and for national independence; expresses its condolences to the leaders of the China Labor Association, the Shanghai Workers' Association, and other democratic labor unions who have suffered destruction and oppression under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang; and expresses its condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the struggle. The Congress calls on all workers in the liberated areas to work one day during a public holiday in August or September this year, on the one hand to express their intensification of production to support the People's Liberation War, and on the other hand to use the wages earned on that day as a fund to aid the struggle of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, in order to express their class sympathy for the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
