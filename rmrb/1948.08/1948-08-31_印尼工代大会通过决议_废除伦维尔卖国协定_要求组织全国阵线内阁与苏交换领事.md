Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 27th: According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Yogyakarta: The congress of delegates representing 32 unions with one million Indonesian workers passed a resolution on the evening of the 22nd, "calling for the abolition of the Renville Agreement and the cessation of negotiations with the Netherlands." The resolution demanded: 1. The Hatta cabinet should resign and a National United Front cabinet should be organized; 2. Intensify the implementation of the scorched earth policy; 3. Negotiations with the Netherlands should only be reopened on the condition that the Netherlands explicitly recognizes the sovereignty of the Republic; 4. Exchange consuls with the Soviet Union and strive for recognition from the republics of Central and Eastern Europe; 5. All properties owned by hostile elements of the Indonesian national revolution should be nationalized without compensation. The resolution concluded by calling on workers to be determined to struggle to realize this program. Note: The Renville Agreement was the result of the United States using the Three-Nation Mediation Committee to undermine Indonesia's war of independence. It was signed by representatives of both Indonesia and the Netherlands on the American ship Renville on January 17th of this year. The agreement betrayed the independence of the Indonesian people, including clauses such as a ceasefire in place, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands continuing to exercise sovereignty over Indonesian territory until the establishment of the United States of Indonesia. The Hatta cabinet was formed under American instigation after the signing of the agreement. Following the capitulationist line of the compromise faction in the Indonesian upper class, the Indonesian army retreated from behind enemy lines according to the Renville Agreement, and conducted humiliating negotiations with the Netherlands. Only under the pressure of the broad masses of the Indonesian people opposing this compromise behavior did the Hatta cabinet recently terminate negotiations with the Netherlands.

　　印尼工代大会通过决议
  　废除伦维尔卖国协定
    要求组织全国阵线内阁与苏交换领事
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据法新社日惹消息：代表一百万印尼工人的三十二个工会的代表大会于二十二日晚通过决议，“号召废除伦维尔协定并停止与荷兰的谈判”。决议中要求：一、哈达内阁辞职，组织全国阵线内阁；二、加强实行焦土政策；三、在荷兰明确承认共和国主权的条件下才与荷兰重开谈判；四、与苏联交换领事，并争取中欧与东欧诸共和国的承认；五、将印尼民族革命的一切敌对分子所有的财产无代价地收归国有。决议最后号召工人们应决心为实现这一纲领而奋斗。按：伦维尔协定是美国利用三国调停委员会破坏印尼独立战争所造成的结果。由印荷双方代表于今年一月十七日在美舰伦维尔号上签订。协定出卖了印尼人民的独立，其中包括就地停战，荷兰王国继续在印尼领土上行使主权，直至印尼合众国成立后为止等条款。哈达内阁是协定签订后在美国策动下组成的。遵循着印尼上层妥协分子的投降路线，根据伦维尔协定撤退了敌后的印尼军队，并与荷兰进行屈辱的谈判。仅仅在印尼广大人民反对这种妥协行为的压力之下，最近哈达内阁才终止了对荷兰的谈判。
