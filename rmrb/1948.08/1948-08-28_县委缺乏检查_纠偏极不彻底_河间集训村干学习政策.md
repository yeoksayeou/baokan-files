　　County Committee Lacks Inspection
　　Rectification is Extremely Incomplete
　　Hejian Trains Village Cadres to Study Policies

　　[Jizhong Telegram] Since August 4th, Hejian has been holding training classes for village cadres to study the correction of wrongly designated class statuses and to rectify land reform policies, linking them to the actual situations in the villages for self-criticism. During the self-criticism, it was discovered that the rectification work was still being done poorly. According to reports and statistics from village cadres, there were still 655 households whose class status should be changed, of which 411 households were middle or rich peasants who had been wrongly designated as landlords or old rich peasants, and 244 households were landlords or old rich peasants who had already become middle or poor peasants. Across the county, 1,060 households of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against had not been rectified or had not been thoroughly rectified, of which 720 households had not been rectified at all, and 340 households had not been resolved thoroughly. Among those not rectified, the doors of 27 households had been wrongly sealed, and more than 160 households had their production and livelihood affected. The most serious cases were in the second and seventh districts. In the second district, 188 households in 15 villages had not been thoroughly rectified. In the seventh district, there were 119 households in 14 villages. According to an investigation of 30 villages in the fourth and eleventh districts, 198 households of middle peasants had been infringed upon. After two rectifications in February and March, 79 households have now been thoroughly rectified, 63 households have been incompletely rectified (36 households had some items returned, 27 households had most items returned), and 56 households have not been rectified at all. These serious phenomena show that the county's leadership is not thorough enough, especially in its inspection work. In addition, the representatives of some villages were evasive and resistant, and did not report the real situation, so the county committee's statistics of 656 households of middle peasants infringed upon and 176 households not thoroughly rectified were far from the actual situation. This has given the leadership an extremely profound lesson.

　　According to the self-criticism, the reasons why the leadership repeatedly emphasized and proposed rectification in the past but failed to thoroughly rectify were: (1) Village cadres and representatives generally had the idea of being afraid to return things, which was even more serious in some villages where there was not much floating wealth or most of it had already been distributed. Generally, representatives said, "It's easy to change the class status, but it's not easy to return things." "If you don't change the class status, you don't have to return things." Some said, "If you change the class status but don't return things to people, how can you talk to them? It's better not to change or return anything." (2) Some village representatives were concerned about face and were afraid of displeasing both sides. For example, the head of the poor peasant league in Puhetun said, "I was the one who led the action (referring to infringing upon middle peasants); how can I explain it to the league members if I change it now?" (3) Because of the above concerns, some representatives adopted an evasive or even resistant attitude, not reporting the actual situation to the higher authorities, and some not conveying the Party's policies to the masses. For example, when the representatives of Huangjia Village and Shijia Village attended the district representatives' meeting and decided which households should have their class status changed and which households should return things, they did not tell the masses when they returned. Liu Changxuan, the representative of Xinglongdian, led the distribution of that household's property and said, "Regardless of whether the higher authorities agree or not, once it is distributed, it cannot be changed back!" (4) Some villages wanted to change the wrongly designated class statuses, but because they were unclear about the criteria for designating class statuses, they did not make the corrections. For example, Dizhuang had discussed how to make corrections, but after studying it for a long time, no one knew how to do it correctly. In addition to the above reasons, some were afraid that the middle peasants would "turn against" them or "retaliate" when they were corrected, or that the landlords and old rich peasants would take the opportunity to counterattack. Some villages' old cadres had just resumed their positions and were afraid that if they led the correction of wrongly designated class statuses and the return of things, the representatives and poor and hired peasants would say it was for their own benefit. Some villages were unable to carry out any work because the representatives' meeting was not responsible, let alone this work.

　　In order to rectify the policies, the Hejian County Committee made a special report on correcting wrongly designated class statuses and compensating middle peasants in the village cadre training class, and organized group discussions. At the beginning, the thinking of some village cadres was very chaotic. Some said, "After all the trouble in the winter, are we going to return everything? Didn't the poor people suffer for nothing?" Some said, "Let the higher authorities return it, we won't return it." Some cadres thought that it was not something they had led and pushed it onto the representatives in the land reform. Later, after repeated discussions and talks, the harms of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants were clarified, and the leadership also reviewed that it had not clearly stipulated the criteria for designating class statuses in the past and that the leadership should be primarily responsible. Criticism was also made of the resistance of individual representatives and the old cadres' shirking of their responsibilities, and it was pointed out that if they did not seriously rectify, they would be held accountable. After further discussions in groups, the general thinking was clarified. For example, Zhang Jinsheng, the chairman of the representative of Zhang Liu Tiangong Village, was worried about returning things at the beginning because he was concerned about face, and was so worried that he wanted to cry; later he changed his mind and said, "If we don't rectify the infringement of middle peasants, the middle peasants will not produce well, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will not be united well. When I go back, I will definitely correct the wrongdoings against the middle peasants in our village." Some said, "This time we are confident, we will clearly divide the classes, and we will thoroughly correct the real wrongdoings." The old cadres of Dingjia Village and Xie Village initially thought it was a matter for the new representatives, but later they also realized it and wrote to the cadres in their villages saying, "Bad work is a loss to the Party, and it is also our responsibility. Our new and old cadres are the same." Finally, according to the instructions of the County Committee and the actual situation of each village, specific rectification methods were discussed and determined, and a determination was made to return to the village immediately for rectification in order to benefit production.

### 县委缺乏检查　纠偏极不彻底　河间集训村干学习政策

　　县委缺乏检查
  　纠偏极不彻底
  　河间集训村干学习政策
    【冀中电】河间自八月四日开始举行村干部训练班，学习改正错订成份和端正土改政策，联系村里实际情况进行检讨。检讨中发现纠偏还作得很差，据各村干部报告统计，应当改订成份的还有六百五十五户，其中四百一十一户是中农或富裕中农被错订为地主或旧富农的，二百四十四户是地主旧富农已下降为中贫农。全县被错斗的中农，未纠正和未彻底纠正的还有一千零六十户，其中七百二十户根本未纠正，三百四十户解决的不彻底。未纠正的里头有二十七户被错封了门，一百六十多户影响了生产和生活。最严重的是二、七区。二区十五个村没有彻底纠正的就有一百八十八户。七区十四个村，有一百一十九户。据四、十一两区三十个村调查，被侵犯的中农一百九十八户。经过二、三月份两次纠正，现已彻底纠正的七十九户，不彻底的六十三户（内退回一部的三十六户，退回大部的二十七户），根本未纠正的五十六户。从这些严重现象看，说明该县领导很不深入，特别是检查工作很不够，再加上部分村庄的代表支应抵抗，反映情况不真实，因此县委统计的全县侵犯中农六百五十六户，未彻底纠正的还有一百七十六户的数字，就与实际相差很远。这给了领导上极其深刻的教训。
    根据检讨，过去领导上几次强调提出纠正而未彻底纠正的原因：（一）村干和代表中普遍存在着怕退东西的思想，一些浮财不多或大部已经分了的村更为严重。一般代表都说：“成份好改，东西不好退。”“不改成份，就不用退东西”。有的说：“改了成份不给人家退东西，怎么和人家说呢！不如不改也不退的好。”（二）部分村庄代表顾情面，怕两头不落好。如浦禾屯贫农团长说：“过去全是我领着弄的（指侵犯中农）；这么一改，怎么对团员说呢？”（三）因为有上述顾虑，部分代表便采取支应甚至抵抗的态度。不向上级反映实际情况，有的不向群众传达党的政策。如黄家村、石家村的代表参加小区代表会时，决定哪户改成份，哪户退东西，他们回去都不向群众说。兴隆店代表刘长轩，区委和他谈了他村哪户应改成份或退东西，他回去倒领着头把那户的东西分了，并说：“管他上级不上级，分了就改不过来了！”（四）有些村想把错订成份改过来，但因为对订成份的标准闹不清，也没改正。如狄庄曾讨论过怎样改正，可是研究了半天谁也闹不清怎么对。除以上原因外，还有的怕改正时中农“翻脸”、“报复”，或怕地主旧富农趁机反攻。有些村旧干部刚恢复职务，怕自己领导改正错订成份退东西，叫代表和贫雇农说是为了落好。也有些村是因为代表会没人负责，什么工作全执行不了，这个工作更无法作。
    为了端正政策，河间县委在村干训练班里把改正错订成份和补偿中农问题专作了报告，并分组展开讨论。开始时，部分村干思想很混乱，有的说：“闹了一冬天又退回去，穷人们又不白闹了吗？”有的说：“咱们不退，叫上级退去吧。”有的考干部认为不是自己领导作的，推到土改中的代表身上。后来经过反复讨论和漫谈，弄明侵犯中农利益的害处，领导上又检讨了过去没有明确规定订成份的标准，领导上应首先负责。对个别代表抵抗和老干部推卸自己应负的责任，也进行了批评，指出再不认真纠正，就要追究责任。又经过小组进一步讨论，一般的思想搞通了。如张刘天宫村代表主席张金声，开头因为顾情面，怕退东西，愁的想哭；后来转过来了，说：“不纠正侵犯中农，中农不好好生产，中贫农也团结不好。回去一定把俺村错动了中农的纠正过来。”有的说：“这回有把握了，把阶级划清楚，真正错动了的一定彻底纠正。”定家店和谢家村老干部，开头总认为是新代表的事，后来也觉悟了，给本村干部写信说：“作坏了是党的损失，也有咱们的事。咱们新老干部是一样。”最后根据县委指示和各村实际情况，经大家讨论定出具体纠正办法，决心回村立即纠正，以利生产。
