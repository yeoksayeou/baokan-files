Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 10th: Under the victorious might of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on all fronts, Kuomintang (KMT) troops in various locations are defecting to our side one after another. (1) In the Northeast, our army's five reception stations surrounding Changchun have, over the past four months, taken in over 3,000 soldiers from the KMT’s New 7th Army and 60th Army. Among them, entire companies, two entire platoons, and five entire squads have defected en masse, bringing with them a total of three 60mm mortars, 25 machine guns, 17 submachine guns, and over 300 rifles and pistols. In the Shenyang area, a unit of the PLA received 127 KMT soldiers who had fled from the city and nearby strongholds between July 1st and 9th, including 14 officers such as Wang Qingwan, a captain and company commander from the 3rd Brigade of the 207th Division. On the Beining Railway, our Red East Sub-district reception station has taken in 1,022 KMT soldiers who have escaped from the Jinzhou-Linyu line since June, including 823 in July alone. Thirteen soldiers from the 3rd Squad of the 1st Platoon and the 8th Squad of the 3rd Platoon of the 8th Regiment of the 67th Division of the Fu Zuoyi bandit troops guarding the railway near the Chadian station north of Tanggu, came over to our side with their weapons on May 30th and June 3rd, respectively. In Rehe Province, at the beginning of June, Sun Fangfu, the platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon of the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Rehe Security Regiment in Chengde, led 17 soldiers, bringing with them one light machine gun and 14 rifles, to defect to our side. In late May, after our capture of Juening Anjiangtun, west of Chengde, we launched a mass movement to win over scattered bandits. In 20 days, we won over more than 200 local bandits from "Brotherhoods" and "Homecoming Legions" who were roaming the area, and collected more than 200 rifles and pistols. In Longhua County, local bandit armed forces such as the "Self-Defense Force," "Brotherhoods," and "Security Police" had, by June 24th, successively come over to our side in groups of more than 400, surrendering three small cannons, five light machine guns, and 320 rifles and carbines. (2) On the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, KMT soldiers under Hu Lian and Zhang Zhen are deserting in increasing numbers amidst the victorious news of our Central Plains Campaign. From July 14th to 16th, in just three days, a unit of the PLA received more than 510 KMT soldiers who had fled from the Zhumadian and Pingxi areas near Luohe, most of whom were soldiers from the 11th Division and the 3rd Reorganized Division of Hu Lian's troops.
