[Pingbao Frontline, 28th dispatch] On July 16th, in the battle of Yi'an northeast of Laishui, commanders of the 7th Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, due to concentrating on planning and carrying out military democracy, cooperated with neighboring units to quickly complete the task of annihilating the enemy. On the morning of that day, our army cleared out the enemy in the village of Bei'yian and prepared to launch a general offensive against the enemy bunkers north of the village. Cao Yingju, the deputy company commander of the company, took cadres from various combat organizations to scout the terrain several times. After returning, he helped them carefully study the plan. If some didn't understand it the first time, they would scout again. For example, the ladder group didn't clearly see the place to erect the ladder and the width and depth of the ditch the first time, so Deputy Company Commander Cao took them to see the terrain a second time. After returning, they specifically studied the place and method of erecting the ladder, and personally led them in rehearsals. The assault group studied how to divide the work to blow up the gun holes in the enemy bunkers. Two minutes after the general offensive began, they occupied the large bunker on the west side. The assault team threw grenades and flying mines into the gun holes to explode them according to their original assigned positions. Deputy Company Commander followed the assault team and ordered the assault troops to outflank the enemy on the north side from the west. Squad Leader of the Fifth Squad said: "The area we are passing through is blocked by the firepower of my right neighbor unit. Let's contact them before passing through!" Deputy Company Commander Cao accepted this suggestion and contacted the friendly army, successfully outflanking to the north and completing the task of annihilating the enemy, capturing more than 300 enemies, seizing one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, and 58 rifles. After the battle, Deputy Company Commander Cao said: "In the past, I didn't believe that the masses could help the command, but now I know the importance of military democracy. If everyone hadn't carefully studied, occupying the big bunker wouldn't have been so quick."

    克涞水北义安战斗中
    某连开展军事民主
    迅速完成歼敌任务
    【平保前线二十八日电】七月十六日解放军某部七连指挥员，在涞水东北义安战斗中，由于专心计划，开展军事民主，配合友邻部队，迅速完成歼敌任务。是日上午，我军扫清北义安村落之敌，准备向村北大碉敌总攻时，该连副连长曹英聚，带着各种战斗组织的干部去侦察地形数次，回来后，再帮助他们细心研究计划，有的第一次没有弄清楚，就再次侦察，如梯子组，第一次没有看清架梯的地方和沟的宽深，曹副连长就第二次带他们去看地形，回来后，具体研究了架梯的地方和方法，并亲自带领进行演习，突击组研究怎样分工去炸毁敌碉堡上的枪眼。总攻开始后两分钟，即占领西边的大碉堡，突击队按照原来分的位置，把手榴弹、飞雷从枪眼扔到里边爆炸了，副连长随着突击队上去，命令突击部队从西边迂回北面的敌人，该连五班长说：“咱们通过的地方，被我右邻部队火力所封锁，和他们联系一下再通过吧！曹副连长接受了这个意见，和友军联系了一下，顺利的迂回到北面，完成歼敌任务，共俘敌人三百余名，缴重机枪一挺，轻机枪四挺，六○炮一门，步枪五十八支，战斗结束后，曹副连长说：“过去我不相信群众会帮助指挥，现在才知道军事民主的重要性了，若不是大家细心研究，占领大碉不会那么快”。
