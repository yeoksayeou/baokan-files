　　Village Cadres in Jingxing District Beat People
    County Party Committee Defies Orders and Fails to Take Action
    [North Yue News] The phenomenon of village cadres beating people in Jingxing District is very serious, and the county party committee leadership has not paid attention to correcting it, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among the masses. In the past two or three months alone, there have been many incidents of beatings in the county. Village cadres in Nanzhai Village, District Three, beat more than ten people under the "reason" of "not beating good people," one of whom was a woman who was beaten to death for requesting a divorce, and then revived. Yang San'san from Yangjiagou, District Two, requested village cadres to severely beat his wife who wanted to divorce him. Xu Kaokao, a security officer in District Nine, married a sixteen-year-old girl from Shibanpian Village who had broken off her engagement with her fiancé, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. At a mass meeting, Xu argued with the masses. After mediation by a cadre from a certain mine, Xu was not reconciled and gathered more than 20 militiamen from other villages to surround Shibanpian Village, taking nine people who had made suggestions to him to Banqiao Village, where they were all severely beaten with wooden sticks and shoe soles. One military dependent woman was beaten the most severely and could not get out of bed for more than two months. On May 19, District Two, led by District Chief Liu Yonghua, interrogated a case of lost cattle and beat Shi Laishu, a 27-year-old cowherd from Nanxing Village, to death! Afterwards, Liu Yonghua and the district cadres did not reflect on their actions at all, but fabricated facts, saying that Shi Laishu died of a sudden illness, attempting to shirk their responsibility. Beating incidents in other districts and villages also occur from time to time. The county party committee has been repeatedly pointed out by higher authorities regarding this serious violation of policy, but it has not aroused due attention. Taking the case of beating the cowherd to death as an example, Commissioner Cui personally ordered County Chief Jia in early June to remove Liu Yonghua from his post and hand him over to the judicial department for interrogation. Comrade Hu Kaiming, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, also repeatedly urged the county to remove Liu from his post and bring him to justice, but due to differences of opinion within the county party committee, the matter has not been seriously dealt with to this day. The county party secretary initially disagreed with removing Liu from his post, but later reluctantly removed him, still using the excuse that it was "a mistake in work" and "afraid of affecting the work morale of other cadres," and tried to condone him in various ways. He ordered Liu to live in the county party committee office to "reflect" and delayed handing him over to the judicial organs. Because the county leadership lacks a deep understanding of this issue, the phenomenon of district and village beatings is quite common, causing many people to develop a fear of district and village cadres. The masses in Shibanpian Village, District Nine, said, "The matter of the quarrel was said to be resolved in our village, who knew they would resort to such vicious means!" People in Zhaozhuangling, District Two, also reflected, "District cadres can beat people to death without consequences, who would dare to provoke them!" In order to carry out democratic life in the countryside and educate cadres throughout the county, it is hoped that the county party committee will seriously review the situation and immediately deal with the above cases.

    Editor's Note: The actions of some district and village cadres in Jingxing that violate laws and Party discipline were not prevented by the Jingxing County Party Committee beforehand, and were not dealt with afterwards. Despite repeated instructions from the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office, they continue to delay and persist in left-leaning errors, resisting the Party's policies. This is a serious act of seeking independence from the Party and must be corrected urgently. It is hoped that the Prefectural Committee, the County Committee, and relevant parties will immediately handle the matter, impose disciplinary sanctions on those who persist in their errors, bring those who have committed crimes to justice, and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

　　井陉区村干部打人
    县委抗命不加处理
    【北岳讯】井陉区村干部打人的现象很严重，县委领导上并未注意纠正，群众异常不满。最近两三个月内，该县即发生打人事件多起。三区南寨村干部在“不打好人”的“理由”下打了十来个人，其中一个妇女因要求离婚被打死，后又喷活。二区杨家沟杨三三请求村干部痛打了要求与他离婚的老婆。九区区治安员许考考，在石板片村与一个十六岁的才和未婚夫解除婚约的少女结婚，引起群众不满。在一个群众会上，许与群众吵起嘴来，经某矿上的干部调解后，许心不甘，竟集合别村民兵廿多人，包围石板片村，将曾向他提过意见的九人带往板桥村，都被用木棒、鞋底重打一顿。其中一个军属妇女被打最重，两个多月不能下炕。五月十九日，二区在区长刘永华带头下，为审讯丢牛事，将南陉村二十七岁的放牛工人石来书吊打毙命！事后刘永华及该区干部毫不反省，反捏造事实说石来书系急病致死，企图推卸责任。其它区村打人的事亦时有所闻。对这种严重违反政策的现象，该县县委已经上级一再指出，仍未引起应有注意。即以打死放牛工人一事为例，崔专员六月初即亲命贾县长将刘永华撤职，交司法部门审讯。地委副书记胡开明同志亦一再督促该县将刘撤职法办，但卒因县委意见分歧，事情发生至今，仍未认真处理。该县县书初则不同意将刘撤职，后来虽勉强撤职，仍以“是工作中的错误”，“怕影响其他干部工作情绪”为词，多方加以姑息。令刘住在县委机关“反省”，迟迟不交司法机关。因为该县领导上对此问题缺乏深刻认识，致区村打人现象颇为普遍，造成不少群众对区村干部发生恐惧心理。九区石板片村群众说：“吵嘴的事俺村都说是解决了，谁知道人家又下这毒手！”二区赵庄岭亦有人反映：“区干部打死人没事，谁还敢惹！”为了在农村开展民主生活与教育全县干部，希望该县县委认真检讨，并立即处理以上案件。（何建平）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：井陉某些区村干部，违犯法律、违犯党纪的行为，井陉县委事先没防止，事后不处理，经地委、专署一再指示，仍继续拖延，坚持左倾错误，抵抗党的政策，这是一种严重的向党闹独立性的行为，亟须纠正。望地委、县委及有关方面立即处理，对坚持错误者应给以纪律制裁，对有犯罪行为者应予法办，并将处理结果在报纸公布。
