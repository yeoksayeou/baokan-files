[Northern Yue News] In this season of lush grass growth, the Second Administrative Office of the Northern Yue Area issued a notice calling on all farmers in the area to immediately mobilize and launch a large-scale green manure application movement. The notice specifically pointed out: (1) Due to the busyness of supporting the front, it is necessary to seize every opportunity to carry it out immediately. (2) After heavy rains, there is a lot of heat grass in the fields, so it must be combined with weeding. (3) Governments at all levels must strengthen leadership and fully mobilize all male, female, and semi-auxiliary labor forces to create a green manure application movement.

Meng County, Wutai County, and other counties, after receiving the instructions from the administrative office, although under the busy task of supporting the front, because the leadership grasped it tightly, some villages have already launched the green manure application movement. The Dianshang Village, led by Meng County cooperative hero Zhao Zhong, immediately convened a meeting after the district cadre meeting to make arrangements and mobilize. The next morning, it organized 46 men, women, and children to go to the slopes to cut artemisia. In half a day, they cut more than 4,290 catties of artemisia. The best among them were Communist Party members Zhao Laixi and Zhang Fu, who each cut more than 170 catties of artemisia. Zhang Yinfeng (female), the village branch secretary, took the lead, and she and Zhang Chou'ni cut more than 200 catties. The village also decided to guarantee 200 catties of artemisia per person for poor, labor-less military dependents, workers' families, and revolutionary martyrs' families to solve their fertilizer difficulties. Nanyang Village in Wutai County, although there is more flat land and less artemisia, there is still plenty of other heat grass. After receiving the call from the administrative office, the village has also begun to apply green manure. According to statistics from seven farmers in the village, they have cut more than 2,960 catties of green grass. The representative meeting of Nanguan Village in the county, in response to the call from the administrative office, seized the opportunity to mobilize the masses to cut artemisia and apply fertilizer. When the call for applying green manure was given to the masses for discussion, because they had no habit of applying green manure in the past, many farmers could not understand it. Some said, "We don't have mountain slopes here, so it's difficult to cut artemisia." Others said, "Green grass cannot be composted." The representative meeting, according to the thinking of the masses, explained that it does not matter if there are no mountain slopes, they can go to Longjia Mountain to cut it (Longjia Mountain is ten miles away from the village). Women, the elderly, and children can cut green grass nearby. Accumulate more fertilizer to grow more grain. After persuasion and mobilization, the masses said, "That's right! We eat by the manure pile, so we must compost." After deliberation and discussion, many people automatically proposed the number of green grass they would cut. Lu Fuqing said, "I will cut 2,000 catties, guaranteed to exceed." Young woman Lu Dagai said, "I will complete 1,500 catties." They said, "This year our village will cut green grass for composting, and other villages will also cut grass for composting, so we must strike first." It was decided to immediately form eight grass-cutting groups, each with village cadres participating, and the green manure application movement is underway in the village.

[Another News] The Xingtang County Committee of the Third Administrative Region of the Northern Yue Area issued an urgent instruction on applying green manure after the rush planting of wasteland was largely completed. The instruction first pointed out that the present is a good season for applying green manure. In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer for wheat planting after autumn, it called on each laborer to apply more than one thousand to five thousand catties of green manure. It also pointed out that other less urgent work should be temporarily suspended, and the task of applying green manure throughout the county should be completed in a blitz, with a blitz time of twenty days (starting from the 10th of this month). The instruction specified that the main cadres in each district must personally go to the countryside for specific inspection and guidance. The Third District of the county has convened a cadre meeting of twenty villages to discuss the steps and methods of applying green manure. (Xingtang County Committee)

　　争取明年小麦丰收
  　北岳开展压肥运动
    【北岳讯】正当绿草盛长的季节，北岳二专署发出通知号召全专区农民，立即动员起来，开展大规模的压绿肥运动。具体指出：（一）因为支前的繁忙，必须抓紧一切空隙立即进行。（二）大雨之后，地里的热草很多，必须与锄草结合起来。（三）各级政府，必须抓紧领导，将所有男女半辅劳动力完全动员起来，造成一个压绿肥运动。
    盂县、五台等县，从接获专署指示后，虽然处于繁忙的支前任务下，因为领导上抓的紧，有的村庄压绿肥运动已经展开。盂县合作英雄赵忠领导下的店上村，自该区干部会后，即马上召开了会议，进行了布置与动员，第二天早晨，就组织了男、女儿童等四十六个人，一齐上坡割蒿，半天内即割蒿四千二百九十多斤。其中最好的是共产党员赵来喜、张福等同志，每人割蒿均在一百七十斤以上。该村支部书记张银凤同志（女）积极带头，她和张丑妮两个人，即割得二百多斤。该村并决定，对贫苦无劳力的军、工、烈属，保证每人割蒿二百斤，解决其肥料困难。五台县南阳村，虽然平地多蒿草少，但其他热草并不少，该村从接到专署号召后，也已经着手压绿肥，根据该村七个农民统计，已割青草二千九百六十多斤。该县南关村代表会，为响应专署号召，抓紧发动群众割蒿压肥。当将压绿肥号召交给群众讨论时，因为以往没有压绿肥的习惯，很多农民打不通思想，有的说：“咱们这里没有山坡，割蒿子困难。”还有的说：“青草不能沤粪”等，代表会根据群众思想，说明没有山坡不要紧，可到龙家山去割（龙家山离该村十里），妇女、老人、儿童、可在附近割青草。多积一点肥，就多打一些粮食。经过说服动员，群众说：“对！看粪堆吃饭哩，不沤肥不行。”经过酝酿咯吵后，不少人都自动的提出自己割青草的数目字，卢福清说：“我割两千斤，保证超过。”青年妇女卢大改说：“我完成一千五百斤。”他们说：“今年咱村割青草沤肥，别的村也要割草沤肥，先下手为强。”决定马上动手割青草。当下就自动结合了八个割草小组，每组均有村干部参加，压绿肥运动正在该村展开。（晋材、建邦、子文）
    【又讯】北岳区三专区行唐县县委会，于抢荒播种大体完成之后，发出压绿肥的紧急指示。该指示首先指出：目前正是压绿肥的好季节，为了保证秋后种麦的足够肥料，号召每个劳动力压绿肥一千多五千斤。并指出其他不很迫切的工作，暂时停止，突击完成全县压绿肥任务，突击时间为二十天（本月十日开始）。指示指定各区主要干部都需亲自下乡，具体的检查指导。该县三区已召开二十个村庄的干部会议，讨论压绿肥的步骤和办法。（行唐县委会）
