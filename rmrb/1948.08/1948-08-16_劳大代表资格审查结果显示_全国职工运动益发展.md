Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th. The Labor Congress Delegate Qualification Review Committee, Li Jiebo, reported the results of the delegate qualification review at the Labor Congress on the 6th as follows: As of the 6th, a total of 519 delegates had registered for the congress. Of the remaining 505 people, excluding 14 people who registered late and are still under review, 504 people passed the review. Only Jiang Peigong, a delegate from Mudanjiang, had his delegate qualification denied for the following reasons: (1) Before the liberation of the Northeast, Jiang was a "batou" (a person who specifically engages in extra exploitation of workers, different from ordinary foremen) in the Sandaogou Coal Mine in Jiandao Province. He often beat and scolded workers, and was nicknamed "King Yama Jiang"; (2) Jiang's election as a delegate did not comply with the delegate generation procedures. Among the delegates who have passed the review: (1) Gender: 472 males and 32 females. (2) Native place: including 30 provinces (or regions), with Shandong and Hebei people being the most numerous. (3) Education level: 49 illiterate, 90 able to read general books and newspapers, 136 with elementary school education, 134 with higher elementary school education, 46 with junior high school education, 18 with senior high school education, 9 with normal school education, 3 with specialized school education, and 17 with university education. (4) Comparison of the number of workers and staff: 381 workers and 123 staff. (5) Positions: 190 chairmen of trade unions at all levels, 28 heads of trade union departments, 123 trade union committee members, and 163 ordinary members. (6) Time of joining the trade union: 398 joined the trade union after the Japanese surrender, 66 joined the trade union during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, 14 joined the trade union during the ten years of civil war, and 26 joined the trade union from 1922 to 1927. (7) Twenty people were arrested and imprisoned by the reactionary ruling class for their participation in the revolutionary struggle. Sixty-eight people directly participated in the revolutionary war, and 24 of them were gloriously wounded. Li Jiebo said: According to the results of the review, it shows the universality of the congress delegates and, even more, the rapid development of the workers' movement in the past two or three years, following the victory of the Liberation War.
