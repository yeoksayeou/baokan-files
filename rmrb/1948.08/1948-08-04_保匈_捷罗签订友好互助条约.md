TASS reports: Bulgaria and Hungary signed a twenty-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, on the 16th. Czechoslovakia and Romania also signed a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on the 21st. These are the fourteenth and fifteenth such treaties signed between the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and between the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe themselves, in the past eight months. These treaties guarantee joint efforts to prevent any new threat of aggression from Germany or countries allied with Germany, and provide broad mutual assistance and cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields. After signing the Bulgaria-Hungary treaty, Dimitrov delivered a speech stating that the peoples of Bulgaria and Hungary "perceive that the imperialists are striving to restore German militarism and use it as a weapon of new aggression.
