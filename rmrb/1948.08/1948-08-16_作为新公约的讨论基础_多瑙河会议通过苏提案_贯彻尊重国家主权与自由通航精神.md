Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. TASS reports: After four days of discussion from the 4th to the 7th, the Danube Conference passed the draft proposed by the Soviet delegation on the 7th as the basis for discussing the new Danube Convention. The full text of the draft consists of five chapters and forty-odd articles, embodying the principle of "respecting the interests and autonomous rights of the Danube countries and ensuring the free navigation of the Danube in order to strengthen the economic and cultural ties between the Danube countries and other countries." Article 1 of the draft explicitly stipulates: "Danube navigation shall be open to citizens, merchant ships, and goods of all countries on the basis of equality in the use of ports, shipping charges, and conditions for merchant ship navigation." On other major issues, the draft stipulates: (1) The concept of the Danube River system should be defined as referring only to the mainstream of the Danube River, and should not include its tributaries and canals on both sides as in the 1921 Convention, so as not to undermine the sovereignty of the countries in which these rivers are located. (2) A single Danube River Commission, composed only of Danube riparian states, should be established as the new navigation management agency, instead of the dual structure of the International Commission and the European Commission as in the 1921 Convention, which would allow non-Danube countries to control the rights and interests of the Danube countries through the latter. (3) All warships of non-Danube countries are prohibited from entering the Danube River, and the privilege granted to non-Danube powers to navigate warships under the 1921 Convention is abolished. (4) When Danube countries have differing interpretations of the provisions of the Convention that lead to disputes, they shall be resolved by arbitration. (5) The draft also includes an annex stipulating: "After the Austrian peace treaty comes into effect, Austria may participate in the Danube River Commission." (6) The annex also stipulates that "all previous treaties and decisions concerning Danube navigation are declared invalid." The delegations of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia unanimously agreed to use the Soviet draft as the basis for discussing the new convention because "it successfully combines the principle of freedom of navigation with the protection of national sovereignty and prevents the danger of imperialist infiltration into the Danube River basin." (Hungarian representative) At the same time, during the week-long meeting of the Danube Conference, representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine repeatedly defeated the conspiracies of the United States, Britain, France, and their puppet Austrian representatives. During the meeting on the 2nd, when discussing the voting method, the method of passing by a majority vote was adopted, opposing the French representative's proposal to pass by a two-thirds majority. At the general meeting on the 7th, the US proposal on the 5th, which infringed upon the interests of the Danube countries regarding the Danube River Commission, was prevented from being established. In addition, although Britain, the United States, and France constantly created "some bizarre and pathetic episodes at the meeting" (Vyshinsky), it was no longer possible to prevent "the resolution of the management of this major waterway on the basis of principles that conform to the fundamental interests of the Danube riparian states."

　　作为新公约的讨论基础
  　多瑙河会议通过苏提案
    贯彻尊重国家主权与自由通航精神
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社报导：多瑙河会议经过四日至七日四天的讨论，已于七日通过苏联代表团提出的草案，作为新的多瑙河公约讨论的基础。草案全文共五章四十余条，贯彻着“尊重多瑙河国家的利益与自主权利，并为加强多瑙河国家相互间以及与其他国家间经济及文化联系，而确保多瑙河的自由通航”的原则。草案第一条明确规定：“多瑙河航运应在使用港口、航运费、与商船航行条件之平等的基础上，对一切国家的公民、商船与商品开放。”在其他主要问题上，草约规定：（一）多瑙河水系的概念，应确定为仅指多瑙河主流，不得如一九二一年公约之包括其支流与在其两侧之运河，以免损及各该河流所在国的主权。（二）成立单一的仅能由多瑙河沿岸国家组成的多瑙河委员会为新的航运管理机构，不得如一九二一年公约之有国际委员会与欧洲委员会两重机构，而使非多瑙河国家得借后者控制多瑙河国家之权益。（三）禁止一切非多瑙河国家的军舰驶入多瑙河，取消一九二一年公约允准非多瑙河列强军舰航行的特权。（四）多瑙河国家在对公约条文发生不同解释致起争执时，由公断解决之。（五）草约并有附件规定：“对奥和约生效后，奥国得参加多瑙河委员会。”（六）附件又规定，“前此一切有关多瑙河航运之条约与决定一律宣布无效。”捷、匈、乌、罗、保、南各国代表团一致赞成以苏联草案为讨论新公约的基础，因为“它成功地把航运自由的原则，与保护国家主权结合在一起，并防止了帝国主义渗入多瑙河流域的危险。”（匈代表）同时在多瑙河会议一周余的会议中，苏、捷、南、匈、罗、乌等国代表曾一再击败美、英、法及其傀儡奥国代表的阴谋。二日会议上讨论表决方式时，通过了过半数通过的表决方式，反对了法代表以三分之二大多数通过的主张。七日大会上又使美国五日提出的侵害多瑙河国家利益的关于多瑙河委员会的提案不能成立。此外，英、美、法虽然不断制造过“会上的一些奇异和可怜的插曲”（维辛斯基），但已不可能阻止“在符合多瑙河沿岸国家基本利益的原则上，解决这一大水道的管理问题了。”（真理报记者朱可夫）
