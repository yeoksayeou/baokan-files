Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 22nd: The Cotton Textile Industry Associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai have telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan, opposing the American revival of the Japanese textile industry, and demanding that the Chiang government abolish the unreasonable control policies that restrict the development of Chinese industry. The telegram stated: "The Chinese people will never forget that the accumulation of capital in the Japanese cotton textile industry was largely condensed from the blood and sweat of the Chinese people; and today, the revival of the Japanese textile kingdom will inevitably be at the expense of the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. Therefore, members of this industry firmly advocate that the Japanese textile industry should be restricted, in order to prevent it from using its surplus productive capacity to carry out its aggression. The retention of Japanese spindle equipment must not exceed the limit necessary for the clothing needs of the Japanese people, and even more so, it must not be higher than the living standards of the people of various Asian countries that have been invaded. According to this principle, Japan should maintain a maximum of three million spindles. (Note: Japan already has 3.5 million spindles, and the United States is preparing to eventually restore Japanese spindles to the pre-war peak level of 12.6 million.)" The telegram demanded that the Chiang government "abolish all restrictions and controls on Chinese industry, so that it can fully develop."

    蒋区棉纺织界呼吁反对
    美帝复兴日本纺织业
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据合众社上海二十二日讯：苏、浙、皖、京、沪区棉纺织工业同业公会顷致电蒋记行政院，反对美国复兴日本纺织工业，并要求蒋政府取消束缚中国工业发展的无理管制政策。该电称：“中国人民永难忘记日本棉纺织业资本之积累大部为中国人民血汗所凝成；而今日日本纺织王国之复兴，又势必以中国人民之血汗供其牺牲。因是本业同人坚决主张对日本纺织工业应予限制，以免挟其过剩之生产力，遂其发展侵略之行径。日本纺锭设备之保留绝不能超过日本人民之衣着必需之限度，尤不能高于亚洲各被侵略国家人民生活之水准。以此原则，则日本纺锭至多维持三百万枚。（按日本现已有纺锭三百五十万枚，美国准备最后将日本纺锭恢复到战前的最高水平一千二百六十万枚）。”该电要求蒋政府“取消束缚中国工业的一切限制和管制，使其能充分发展”。
