    A Certain Unit Conducts Policy Education
    Exercises Urban Policy
    [This Newspaper Reports] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, while conducting assault and demolition exercises, also held urban policy exercises. Prior to the exercises, all units conducted education on the Party's policies and made arrangements for political work. Some units discussed in detail the content of propaganda for various social strata. Some units re-distributed the "Entry into the City Discipline Code" promulgated by the Field Headquarters Political Department to each squad. In one unit's exercise, after "entering" a certain city, they immediately wrote slogans, broadcast from high buildings, and publicized the Party's policy of protecting cities and developing industry and commerce. When soldiers entered factories and saw workers, they immediately proclaimed: "We will protect your interests, and your lives will improve after liberation!" A panicked puppet postal bureau chief asked the soldiers, "What will happen to me, the bureau chief?" The soldiers immediately explained the Party's lenient policy to him and told him: "Don't be afraid, as long as you serve the people, you can still work at the post office." Upon seeing enemy warehouses, cadres immediately sent people to guard them. When the warehouse director tried to give fountain pens and watches to the PLA soldiers, he was immediately refused. Propagandists, upon seeing wounded enemy soldiers left behind, explained our policy on prisoners to them and even helped them to the PLA treatment center for treatment. After the exercise, the soldiers all felt: "Knowing the Party's policies, we won't violate them when we enter the city in the future!" "In future battles, we won't just fight tactics, but more importantly, implement the Party's policies!"

    某部进行政策教育
    演习城市政策
    【本报讯】解放军某部与攻坚爆炸演习的同时，举行城市政策演习。事前各部队进行党的政策教育，作了政治工作的布置。有的详细讨论了对各阶层的宣传内容。有的重新把野战司令部政治部公布的入城纪律守则发到各班。某部演习打进某城后，立即书写标语，进行高房广播，宣传党的保护城市的政策和发展工商业的政策。战士进入工厂，见到工人，立即宣传：“我们要保护你们的利益，解放后你们的生活就要改善了。”一个伪邮政局长惊慌不安的问战士：“我这局长怎么办？”战士们立即向他解释党的宽大政策，并告诉他：“你不要害怕，只要你为人民服务，还可以做邮局工作的。”见到敌人仓库，干部立即派人看管起来，仓库主任想把钢笔手表送给解放军战士，立即被拒绝了。宣传员见到敌人扔下的伤员，给他解释我们的俘虏政策，还扶他到解放军的治疗所去治疗。经过演习，战士们都觉着：“知道了党的政策，将来打进城市就不会违犯了！”“以后打仗不光打战术，更要执行党的政策！”
