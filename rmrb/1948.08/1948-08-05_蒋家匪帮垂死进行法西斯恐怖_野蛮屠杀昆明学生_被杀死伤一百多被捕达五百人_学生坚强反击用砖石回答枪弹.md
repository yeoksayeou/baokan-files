Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Following the "July 5th" massacre in Beiping, the Kuomintang reactionaries perpetrated an even more savage massacre and arrest of students in Kunming in mid-July. According to reports from various sources, the incident unfolded as follows:

Kunming's university and middle school students, in protest against the arrest of twenty-nine classmates during the June 17th anti-American imperialist support for Japan demonstration, initiated a three-day general strike on June 18th, demanding the unconditional release of those arrested. During the strike, they took to the streets to conduct patriotic and anti-persecution propaganda. To resist further persecution by the reactionaries, middle school students moved en masse into Yunnan University and Nanching Middle School to live collectively. (Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, June 19th, 20th, July 2nd, and Beiping New Life Daily, June 23rd.)

During this period, the Kuomintang reactionary government continued to suppress the students. On the afternoon of July 1st, over twenty students from a propaganda team were arrested on Zhengyi Road (Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, 3rd); on the morning of the 8th, Lu Fusheng, the director of discipline at Tianxiang Middle School, was arrested, and three students from Nanching Middle School and other schools were shot and wounded (Tianjin Republic Daily, 9th); on July 4th, the Yunnan University Affiliated Middle School was brazenly dissolved. However, all of this failed to quell the boiling patriotic struggle of the Kunming students, who insisted on not leaving Yunnan University and Nanching Middle School until all arrested classmates were released.

On the early morning of July 15th, the Kuomintang reactionary government dispatched a large number of police and gendarmes to surround both schools, marking the beginning of this major massacre. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on July 26th, citing a Central University Weekly report on the situation at Yunnan University: "Over a thousand armed police and gendarmes, under the command of Yunnan Province Chairman Lu Han and Kunming Garrison Commander He Shaozhou, surrounded a building at Yunnan University and launched an armed attack. Students responded to the bullets by throwing bricks and stones. As a result of the machine gun fire, over one hundred and fifty students were killed or wounded." According to the Central News Agency, military police arrested all students on the 16th. The entire physics and chemistry laboratory of the school was destroyed. At Nanching Middle School, according to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th, after several hours of siege, all students were arrested around 10 a.m. that day. The principal of the school, Wei Zexin, was also among those arrested. Many students were injured.

The exact number of students from various schools residing in the two schools who were arrested is unknown. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 17th, citing the Central News Agency, it was four hundred to five hundred people. Among the arrested teachers and students, in addition to some who will be sent to the fascist "Special Criminal Tribunal," according to the Central News Agency, as many as three hundred and thirty-seven people were sent to concentration camp-style so-called "summer camps" for "training."

After perpetrating this major massacre, the Kuomintang reactionaries continued to implement various measures to destroy education and persecute students. On July 17th, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education replaced thirteen principals of provincial middle schools and announced that all newly added private middle schools would not be allowed to be established for the time being. Middle schools that have not been registered are not allowed to enroll students without authorization, and private middle schools that have been registered must obtain the consent of the Kuomintang education administrative authorities before hiring principals.

While its high-pressure policies have been met with strong resistance in major cities such as Peiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the Kuomintang reactionaries chose Kunming, a relatively remote or now relatively remote place, to carry out large-scale fascist terror. However, authoritative observers believe that no such terror can save the reactionaries from extinction; all reactionary murderers who continue to do evil will not be able to escape the people's just retribution in the near future.

    蒋家匪帮垂死进行法西斯恐怖
    野蛮屠杀昆明学生
    被杀死伤一百多被捕达五百人
    学生坚强反击用砖石回答枪弹
    【新华社陕北三日电】紧接北平“七、五”惨案之后，国民党反动政府又于七月中旬在昆明制造了更野蛮的屠杀和逮捕学生的血案。据各方消息报导此一事件经过如下：
    昆明各大、中学学生，为抗议六月十七日反对美帝扶日大游行中二十九名同学的被捕，于六月十八日起总罢课三天，要求无条件释放被捕者，并在罢课期间出发街头进行爱国及反迫害宣传。各中学学生为抵抗反动派的继续迫害起见，纷纷搬入云南大学及南菁中学两校集体居住。（六月十九、二十日，七月二日天津大公报及北平新生报六月二十三日消息）
    在此期间，国民党反动政府仍继续镇压学生。七月一日下午，在正义路逮捕学生宣传队二十余人（天津大公报三日讯）；八日晨，逮捕天祥中学训导主任卢富生，并枪伤南菁中学等校学生三人（天津民国日报九日讯）；七月四日，悍然解散云南大学附属中学。但这一切并未能遏止昆明学生热血沸腾的爱国斗争，他们坚持全部被捕同学未释放前决不迁离云大与南菁中学。
    七月十五日清晨，国民党反动政府派遣大量警察、宪兵分别包围两校，此一大屠杀案即告开始。据塔斯社南京七月二十六日电引中大周报通讯报导云南大学一校情形称：“千余名武装警察和宪兵在云南省主席卢汉在昆明警备总司令何绍周指挥下，包围了云大的一所房屋，并发动武装攻击。学生们投掷砖头和石块来回答枪弹。步步与机枪开火的结果，学生一百五十余名被杀或受伤。”另据中央社透露，军警于十六日将学生全部逮捕。该校理化室全部被毁。在南菁中学，据中央社十五日电透露：经数小时围攻后，当日上午十时许即将全部学生逮捕，该校校长魏泽馨亦在被捕之列。受伤学生甚多。
    留居两校的各校学生被捕确数未悉。据美联社上海十七日电引中央社讯为四百到五百人。被捕师生中除部分将被送往法西斯的“特种刑事法庭”外，据中央社透露，被送入集中营式的所谓“夏令营”“受训”者即达三百三十七人。
    国民党反动派制造此一大屠杀案后，复继续施行种种摧残教育迫害学生的措施。云南省教育厅于七月十七日撤换省立中学校长十三人，并宣布所有新增私立中学暂时一律不准成立，未经立案之中学不得擅自招生，已立案之各私立中学聘任校长，须先经国民党教育行政主管同意。
    国民党反动派在其高压政策在平津京沪等大城市都遭受坚强反击的时候，选择了昆明这样比较偏僻或现已比较偏僻的地方，进行大规模的法西斯恐怖。但是权威的观察家相信：任何这种恐怖决不能挽救反动派的灭亡；一切继续作恶的反动派凶手在不久的将来必不能逃脱人民的正义的报复。
