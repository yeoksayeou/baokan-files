[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Agricultural Departments of the Jinji-Luyu Border Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Committee call on cadres and the masses along the river to concentrate their efforts on fighting the floods: After the wheat harvest this year, there was a period of drought, and the seedlings were damaged. Up to July 18, North China experienced continuous rain for three or four days, with rainfall reaching about 300 hao (accounting for more than half of the average annual rainfall in North China). As a result, floods in various rivers have risen sharply. The magnitude of the floods is unprecedented since 1939, resulting in a fairly serious flood disaster (see Comprehensive Report on Floods in North China). Therefore, local flood prevention and water management, production and disaster relief are extremely important tasks at present.

Flood control has always been valued by our democratic government. In previous years, huge amounts of funds and labor have been used to build dikes. This summer, Hebei Central and other regions convened flood prevention meetings one after another and made specific preparations. Many practical flood prevention and plugging work was also carried out when the rainy season arrived. However, this serious flood still occurred. The reasons are, on the one hand, the concentrated rainfall this year, the sharp rise of river water, and the inhuman Chiang Kai-shek bandits digging dikes and causing breaches in some areas; on the other hand, we also have some serious shortcomings and errors in our subjective flood prevention work:

\tParalysis, relaxation, and insufficient preparation led to the gradual expansion of the flood

First, there was paralysis and relaxation in leadership, insufficient preparation in advance, and negligence in prevention. In particular, in some areas of southern Hebei, the flood was underestimated. They did not grasp the law that "there must be heavy rain after a long drought," and only paid attention to drought resistance, but did not prevent floods early. After the breach, they showed panic and incompetence, which gradually expanded the flood and caused serious losses. For example, in Lizhuang, Linqing, they only went to the dikes to defend when the water was high. The masses were not tightly organized, and after the breach, they ran around in chaos and could not be stopped. There were no preparations for disaster relief materials, and even axes and saws for felling trees could not be found. Therefore, rescue work could not be carried out in a timely manner. The breach occurred on the afternoon of the 24th of last month, but construction did not begin until the 28th, and the breach had expanded from 30 to 50 meters to more than 150 meters. Also, due to the lack of a practical plan and strict organization, the rapid and effective progress of the plugging project was affected. More than 15,000 gunny sacks were needed, but only 500 gunny sacks and 3,000 reed mats were collected during construction. After mobilizing thousands of people to the dikes, food and other supplies were not well organized, so work efficiency was very low. As of August 1, the plugging was still less than half completed. Similar situations also exist in other regions. In some areas, cadres led the masses to protect the dikes, but they were careless, which led to breaches. For example, the breach in Caolu, Hebei Central, was because the cadres only engaged in dangerous projects and ignored defense, leaving only two children to watch the shop. When the leak was discovered, it was too late to save it. The south breach of Linqing Farm in southern Hebei was also caused by the culvert not being properly plugged. All these indicate that the leadership was paralyzed in advance, did not carry out specific preparations and effective organization of defense, resulting in breaches and serious losses. Facts have also proved that if the leadership attaches importance to flood prevention and can indeed effectively prepare and organize work, it can safely pass the flood season or reduce losses. For example, Raoyang, Hebei Central, prepared 730 large wooden piles, 10,000 bricks, 96,000 catties of wheat straw and sorghum straw, and mats, pockets, hemp, ropes, and wood in early July; and carried out preliminary signing tests on the north dike of the Hutuo River before the flood. In one and a half days, they completed 7,712 zhang of preliminary signing tests, plugged 44 water holes, 669 animal nests, and 6 ditches. Under the guidance of the headquarters composed of the municipal government and various streets, 40,719 workers were used in the four dangerous sections of Bozhen, and the 154 zhang project was widened and thickened in advance, so that it could safely pass the flood season. In Nanning, southern Hebei, under the slogan of "defending the dike is like saving lives, and plugging the breach is like putting out a fire," the masses were mobilized to construct in heavy rain, and the breach was plugged in one go. Some villagers in a district dismantled their own houses, removed their own doors, and uncovered their own mats in order to rush to rescue and plug the breach. Thanks to good mobilization and organization, the district and village cadres worked hard with the masses, and all the breaches in the county were plugged by the evening of the 24th. These should all be commended. Second, some comrades did not pay serious attention to the flood and did not care enough about the interests of the masses. After the flood breach, they showed serious bureaucracy and incompetence and dereliction of duty, which led to the development of the disaster and the expansion of losses. Some comrades in charge of river defense left their posts for personal life at a critical moment of serious breach, or excused themselves because of heavy rain and difficult roads, and did not share the joys and sorrows with the masses. Some comrades thought: "The water hasn't come yet, so there's no need to prepare first. Just say it when the water comes." Some comrades also had a fluke mentality, saying: "The water is returning to the heart, and the water will fall!" "Don't the masses know how to plug the breach?" Etc. This kind of bureaucracy that turns a blind eye to the flood or lacks sufficient understanding relaxes flood prevention and plugging; or only calls on the masses to passively watch the dike, but not to build dikes or reinforce dams. Some responsible comrades, facing the disaster of the masses, panicked and could not lead the masses to carry out rescue work with a rapid, responsible, and decisive style. For this serious flood involving the lives and property of millions of people, this irresponsible attitude towards the people has actually emerged, and should be strictly investigated and held accountable. Of course, there are also many responsible comrades who personally went to the dikes regardless of the dangers, organized the masses to direct the rescue. For example, County Chief Chen of Anping, Hebei Central, and cadres of Raoyang personally led the masses to rush to plug the breach, so that the subsidence section of the Hutuo River north dike near Wumaoying was spared from breaching; the county secretary, county committee, deputy county magistrate, and public security bureau chief of Renqiu County personally went to the dikes to inspect. The commissioner of the Ninth Special District and the main cadres of the county magistrates and county committees along the river all went to the dikes to organize the masses to rush to rescue; County Chief Zhang, Minister Wang, and Bureau Chief Wu of Jize, southern Hebei, personally went to the dikes in the rain to inspect and urge the plugging and repairing; the county magistrate and county committee secretary of Linzhang County personally went to the river to organize the masses to do their best to plug the breach. These should all be commended and learned from. Third, the masses and cadres in some areas have localism and empiricism in their thinking. For example, stealing dikes from the opposite bank and blaming others; or those close to the dikes are passive and relaxed because they will not be flooded after the breach. Those far from the dikes are unwilling to send labor, send old men and children to cope, do not bring tools, and do not work actively; or do not think from a comprehensive perspective, do not complete the assigned tasks, affect the unified plan, so that the repair and rescue projects cannot be effectively and quickly completed, causing losses. Some comrades also do not proceed from reality. In the emergency situation where the situation is changing at any time, they still insist on carrying out the work according to their own subjective regulations, or hold meetings all day long, delaying time and causing accidents. These harmful phenomena should be corrected immediately.

Due to the above-mentioned serious errors of paralysis, relaxation, negligence in prevention by the leadership, bureaucracy, incompetence, dereliction of duty, localism, empiricism, etc., some areas could not prevent in advance, and could not rescue effectively and timely when things happened, causing serious losses. This is a very painful lesson, which should be deeply reviewed and corrected immediately.

\tImmediately take effective measures

According to the current situation, we should immediately take the following measures: First, the flood area should concentrate all its strength and take emergency measures. The leadership should personally take action and lead the masses to rush to plug the breaches, try to reduce the flooded area; drain the accumulated water, reduce crop losses, and protect the harvest; at the same time, actively build dikes, tamp, protect dikes, and protect riverbanks to block water holes, so as to prevent breaches; and repair damaged farmland and channels, restore production, and restore irrigation. Second, organize troops and militias in the areas bordering the enemy to fight against Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage and armed dike protection. Third, resettle and comfort the disaster-stricken people. In severely flooded areas, shelters should be set up in appropriate locations to promptly accommodate the victims, call on the masses to help each other, protect villages, protect houses, and protect food. Seize the time to replant buckwheat, mustard, turnip, radish, vegetables, etc. Carry out rush weeding, suppress green manure, develop various side businesses, and adjust wheat seeds for dehydration and wheat planting. Fourth, strengthen discipline and clarify rewards and punishments. Those who steal dikes and break mouths should be severely punished; those who are paralyzed and relaxed, passive and derelict of duty should be criticized or punished; those who are actively responsible for rushing to rescue and plug breaches and protect dikes should be commended and rewarded. We must recognize that the rainy season is not over and the flood is still at a critical juncture. We should be vigilant and not allow any paralysis or relaxation, and be prepared at all times. Learn from the style of some responsible comrades who personally go to the dikes to understand the water conditions of the dikes, patrol, and direct. Strengthen flood prevention organizations, conduct in-depth inspections and supervision, and educate the masses to rescue themselves and others. Mobilize manpower and disaster relief materials according to needs in a planned way, scientifically use forces, divide labor by work points, and assign specific personnel to be responsible for improving work efficiency. We should also learn from the masses in this struggle against the flood, study the overall experience of river management and flood prevention in the future, and formulate long-term and effective water management plans.

### 雨期未过水灾仍在严重关头　应集中力量防汛救灾

　　雨期未过水灾仍在严重关头
  　应集中力量防汛救灾
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边府、晋察冀边委会农业厅号召沿河各地干部群众，集中力量与水灾作斗争：今年麦收后曾一度显旱，禾苗受损。迄七月十八日，华北普遍连雨三、四天，雨量达三百耗左右（占华北平均全年雨量的一半以上）。因之各河洪水暴涨，水势之大为民国二十八年以来所未有，酿成相当严重的水灾（见华北水灾综合报导）。因此各地的防汛治水，生产救灾，乃是当前极其严重的任务。
    防洪向为我民主政府所重视，历年均用巨大资财、劳力修筑堤防，今夏冀中等区曾先后召开防汛会议，作了具体准备，雨季到来又作了许多防汛堵口的实际工作。但仍酿成此严重水灾。其原因一方面是今年雨量集中，河水暴涨，以及某些地区被惨无人道的蒋匪扒堤决口；一方面我们在主观上，对防汛工作也存在着某些严重的缺点和错误：
    麻痹松懈准备不够以致水灾逐渐扩大
    第一、领导上麻痹、松懈、事先无足够准备，疏于防范。特别是冀南某些地区，对洪水估计不足，未把握“久旱之后必有大雨”的规律，只注意抗旱，未及早防洪。决口后又表现慌乱无能，以致水灾逐渐扩大，造成严重损失。如临清里庄，至水势大涨始上堤防守，群众又无严密组织，决口后纷纷乱跑，无法阻遏；抢险材料毫无准备，甚至连伐树的斧头、锯子也找不到。因此不能及时的进行抢救工作。上月二十四日下午决口，延至二十八日始动工抢堵，决口处已由三、四丈发展到五十余丈。又因无切实计划严密组织，也影响堵口工程迅速有效的进行。本需要麻袋一万五千条以上，而施工时只凑集了五百条麻袋及三千条蒲包。动员数千人上堤后，伙食等亦未很好组织，因此工作效率非常低。迄八月一日，堵口仍未及半。其他地区也有类似情况。有的地区干部虽带领群众护堤，却粗心大意，以致决口。如冀中草芦的决口，系因干部只搞险工，忽视防守，仅留两个小孩看铺，发觉漏口时已不可收拾。冀南临清农场南决口，亦系因涵洞未塞好所致。凡此种种，都说明领导上事先麻痹，未进行具体准备工作与有效的组织防守，致遭决口，造成严重损失。事实也证明：凡领导上重视防汛，能确实有效的准行准备工作与组织工作，则可稳渡洪汛或减少损失。如冀中饶阳于七月初即准备七百三十根大木桩，一万块砖，九万六千斤麦秸、秫秸和席、口袋、麻、绳、木头等；并于发水前在滹沱河北堤进行签试，一天半的功夫完成了七千七百一十二丈的初步签试，堵填水眼四十四个，兽窝六百六十九个，水沟六道。泊镇段四处险工，在市政府和各街组成的指挥部指导下，用工四万零七百一十九个，将一百五十四丈的工程，事先加宽培厚，得以安全的渡汛期。冀南宁南在“挡堤如救命，堵口如救火”的口号下，动员群众在倾盆大雨中施工，一口气将决口堵好。一区有些村庄的群众为了抢险堵口，曾拆自己的房，摘自己的门，揭自己的席。由于动员组织的好，区村干部与群众一道努力，全县各处决口至廿四日晚即全部堵住。这些都是应该表扬的。第二、有些同志对水灾未严正注意，关心群众利益不够，在洪水决口后表现了严重的官僚主义与无能、失职，以致灾情发展损失扩大。某些河防负责同志在决口严重关头，为私人生活离开工作岗位，或借口雨大、道路难走，不与群众同甘共苦。有些同志认为：“水没来呢，先不用准备，水来了一说就行。”还有的同志存在着侥幸心理，说什么：“水沫归心啦，水将落啦！”“群众不懂堵口吗？”等等。这种对水灾熟视无睹或无足够认识的官僚主义，放松了防洪堵口；或只叫群众消极的看堤，而不筑堤、固坝。有的负责同志面对群众灾难，慌乱无措，不能以迅速、负责、果敢的作风，带领群众进行抢救，对于这种千百万群众生命财产所系的严重水灾，竟出现了这种对人民不负责任的态度，应该严格检查，追究责任。当然也有不少的负责同志，不顾艰险亲自上堤，组织群众指挥抢险。如冀中安平陈县长及饶阳干部亲自领导群众抢堵，使武毛营附近滤沱河北堤下塌堤段免于决口；任邱县书、县委、副县长、公安局长等亲自上堤检查，九专区专员和沿河各县长、县委等主要干部都上堤组织群众抢险；冀南鸡泽张县长、王部长、吴局长等冒雨亲到各堤检查，督促堵修；临漳县县长、县委书记亲自到河上组织群众全力堵口。这些都是应该表扬和学习的。第三、某些地区群众干部思想上存在着地方主义和经验主义。如对岸偷堤，嫁祸于人；或离堤近的因决口后淹不着自己而消极松懈。离堤远的不愿出夫，派老头小孩应付，不带工具，不极积工作；或不从全面着想，不完成指定任务，影响统一计划，致使修整抢险工程不能有效的迅速完成，造成损失。也有些同志不从实际出发，在情况随时变化的紧急关头，仍坚持按照自己主观规定的一套进行工作，或整天开会误时失事，这些有害的现象都应立即纠正。
    由于上述领导上的麻痹、松懈、疏于防范，及对群众利益不够关心的官僚主义、无能失职及地方主义、经验主义等严重错误，致使若干地区事前不能及早预为防范，事到又不能及时有效的抢救，造成严重的损失，这是十分沉痛的教训，应该深刻检讨，立即纠正。
    立即进行有效措施
    根据目前情况，我们应该立即进行以下措置：第一、汛区要集中全力，采取紧急措施。领导上应亲自动手，带领群众抢堵决口，尽量缩小被淹面积；排泄积水，减少庄稼损失，保卫收成；同时要积极培堤、打夯、护堤、护岸堵水眼，以杜绝决口；并修整冲坏田地、渠道，恢复生产，恢复灌溉。第二、在接敌区组织部队民兵，打击蒋匪士顽破坏，武装护堤。第三、安置慰问被灾群众。泛滥严重地区，要在适当地址设置收容所，及时收容灾民，号召群众互助互救，护村、护房、护粮。抓紧时间补种荞麦、芥菜、蔓菁、萝＠、蔬菜等。突击锄苗、压绿肥，开展各种副业，调剂麦种，以备脱水种麦。第四、加强纪律，严明赏罚。对偷堤扒口者，应予以严惩；对麻痹松懈、消极失职者，予以批评或处分；对积极负责抢险堵口护堤有功者，予以表扬奖励。我们要认识雨期未过，水灾仍在严重关头。应提高警惕，不容丝毫麻痹松懈，要随时作好准备工作。学习某些负责同志亲自上堤，了解堤坝水情、巡守、指挥的作风。加强防汛组织，深入检查督促，教育群众救人自救。有计划的按需要动员人力及抢险材料，科学的使用力量，按工分段，指定专人负责，以提高工作效率。还应从此次与水灾斗争中，向群众学习，研究今后治河防洪的全盘经验，拟订长远有效的治水大计。
