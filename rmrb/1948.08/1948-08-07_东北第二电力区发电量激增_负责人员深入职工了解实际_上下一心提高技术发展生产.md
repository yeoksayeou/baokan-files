(Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd) The Second Electricity Bureau of the Second Electricity District in the Northeast Liberated Area mobilized administrative, trade union, branch, and technical personnel to go deep among the workers to understand their difficulties and problems in actual work and life, provide specific guidance, and solve them in a timely manner. It also correctly promoted new cadres, promoting one deputy director, three section chiefs, and more than forty unit chiefs, team leaders, and administrative cadres from among the workers. As a result, the enthusiasm and technology of the workers have been universally improved. In the past six months, power generation has increased threefold compared with the same period last year, and 90% compared with the whole of last year. Regarding the use of materials, thanks to the good implementation of the budget system, the bureau saved a total of 1,500 tons of coal in five months. The iron factory and other departments used about one-third less material than last year. The workers also actively collected old and broken materials to manufacture substitutes, saving 30,000 yuan in expenses in six months. In addition, individuals voluntarily contributed more than 10,000 catties of equipment. The work of the trade union has also greatly developed in the past six months, with the number of members increasing more than fivefold, accounting for more than 78% of all employees. Workers' welfare has been greatly strengthened. Medical clinics, schools for workers' children, and workers' night schools have been established, and workers' cooperatives and single workers' canteens have been organized to guarantee workers' food, clothing, and housing. In the past six months, the power generation of the First Electricity Bureau of the district has also increased by 38.5% compared with the whole of last year, the capacity of power generation equipment has nearly doubled, and the transmission lines have been extended by more than 19,000 meters. Most of the newly added electricity is used for the development of industry and commerce. For example, power accounts for 82.6% of the capacity of power equipment, and electric lights account for 16.9%. In the past six months, the usage of power by power users has increased by two-thirds. The enthusiasm of the workers in the bureau is extremely high. In addition to completing the original construction plan in the past six months, they have also repaired 93 3,300-volt transformers and two 22,000-volt transformers. In addition, they completed experiments on water turbine generators, water pressure regulators, etc. in collective research. In the past, not only had workers never seen this kind of experiment, but even technical personnel had not done it entirely by themselves. However, thanks to the strength of the entire factory, everyone worked together, and finally overcame various difficulties and completed the task.
