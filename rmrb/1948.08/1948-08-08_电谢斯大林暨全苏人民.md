Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th. The Sixth National Labor Congress has telegraphed greetings to Marshal Stalin and the entire Soviet people. The original telegram is as follows: To Marshal Stalin and to the entire Soviet people:

    The Sixth National Labor Congress of China solemnly opened today—August 1st—in Harbin, which was liberated by the Red Army. This is a sign of the victory of the Chinese working class and the national people's liberation struggle. This victory is inseparable from the Soviet people's consistent sympathy and assistance to the Chinese revolution. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to providing spiritual encouragement and material assistance, the Soviet Union did not hesitate to sacrifice itself, dispatching the heroic Red Army to finally defeat Japanese imperialism and liberate the Northeast, allowing the 40 million people of the Northeast to escape 14 years of enslaved life, and helping the liberation of the entire Chinese people. This great achievement is something the Chinese people will never forget! The Congress hereby expresses its most sincere gratitude to the proletarian revolutionary teacher Marshal Stalin and the entire Soviet people! And extends the highest proletarian salute!
          The Sixth National Labor Congress of China, Harbin, August 1st
