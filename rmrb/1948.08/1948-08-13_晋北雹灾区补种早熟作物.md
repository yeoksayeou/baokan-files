　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui Telegram: People in various parts of northern Shanxi are organizing a large amount of manpower and animal power to replant early-maturing crops in hail-stricken areas. In late July and early this month, sixteen counties including Dai County, Huairen, Shanyin, Zuoyun, Wuzhai, and Fugu on the west bank of the Yellow River were hit by sudden hailstorms, affecting more than 200 villages and destroying more than 200,000 mu of farmland. The leading organs of Wuzhai County immediately led the people in a crash effort to replant most of the 20,000 mu of damaged land. In the fifth district of Dai County, the villages of Heishanzhuang and Xigaoquan alone replanted more than 600 mu in three days. The industry and commerce bureaus of various counties in Yanbei are purchasing large quantities of buckwheat and autumn vegetable seeds and distributing them to farmers in the disaster areas free of charge. The Suiyuan-Mongolia Military Region and other units have also drawn out more than 400 laborers to help the people hoe the land and replant more than 1,500 mu.

　　晋北雹灾区补种早熟作物
    【新华社晋绥电】晋北各地人民组织大量人力畜力，到遭受冰雹地区补种早熟作物。上月下旬及本月初，代县、怀仁、山阴、左云、五寨及黄河西岸之府谷等十六县突降雹灾，受灾村庄二百余个，被打毁的田禾有二十余万亩。五寨县领导机关立即领导人民突击，将两万亩遭害的土地大部改种完毕。代县五区，仅黑山庄、西高泉两庄，三天即补种完六百余亩。雁北各县工商局大量收买荞麦及秋菜种籽，无代价分发灾区农民。绥蒙军区等机关亦抽出四百余个劳动力，助民锄地改种一千五百余亩。
