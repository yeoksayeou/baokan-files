    Our Army's Great Victories Shake the Morale of the Chiang Army;
    Chiang's Troops in Pingjin and Baoding Flee in Increasing Numbers;
    Over a Thousand Received in Wuqing County, Tianjin, in Less Than a Month
    [Jizhong Electric Dispatch] The Chiang Army Veterans Reception Center in Wuqing County, Tianjin, received a total of 1,019 Chiang soldiers who surrendered or deserted from June 5th to the end of the month. These Chiang soldiers mostly fled from the Beining Line, the Northeast, and the Daqinghe River area, risking pursuit and massacre by the Chiang bandits to reach the liberated areas. They were deeply grateful for the sincere reception they received from the soldiers and civilians of the liberated areas.
    [Another Electric Dispatch] The Chiang bandit army on the Pingbao Line is experiencing increasing desertions under the continuous attacks of our army. The Ninth Sub-district Chiang Army Veterans Reception Center received 170 deserters and surrenders in June. Among them, eight Chiang soldiers brought eight rifles and more than 600 rounds of ammunition.
    [Another Electric Dispatch] Three hundred trainees from the Jizhong People's Liberation Army Officer Training Corps joined the People's Liberation Army and set off for the front line on July 10 to fight the Chiang bandits bravely. Before their departure, the corps held a grand farewell meeting. Liu Shufen, a representative of the joining soldiers, said: "Today we have put on the glorious hat and become soldiers of the People's Liberation Army; after going to the front, we must kill more enemies, capture more prisoners, and seize more guns, and we will not return home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek."
    [Chahar Electric Dispatch] Under the shock of the People's Liberation Army's great victories, the morale of the Chiang bandits is declining day by day. In addition, with our active efforts to disintegrate them, the Chiang soldiers who surrender to us have developed from soldiers to lower-ranking officers. The Yueyue Fifth Sub-district received a total of 137 surrendering Chiang soldiers in the first half of July, including two instructors and one second lieutenant adjutant, exceeding the total number of surrenders in February and March. According to the surrendering Chiang soldiers, meetings, roll calls, festivals, and work deployments have become good opportunities to escape. On the day of the May Festival, the company commander and platoon leaders of the 11th company of the 3rd battalion of the 1st regiment of the 31st division of the New Second Army were all drunk. Encouraged by the new recruit Wang Yuwen, a platoon of more than 30 people ran away, leaving only the platoon leader and squad leader. On the same day, soldiers of the machine gun and artillery company of the 43rd division of the 94th army stationed in Zhuozhou County took advantage of the company commander's drunkenness and ran away overnight.

    我军巨大胜利震落蒋军士气
    平津保蒋军逃亡日增
    我津武县不到一月收容千余
    【冀中电】我津武县蒋军退伍招待所，自六月五日到月底，共收容投诚，逃亡之蒋军一千零一十九名。这些蒋军多是从北宁线、东北及大清河北地区，冒着蒋匪追捕残杀的危险逃到解放区的。他们受到解放区军民的真诚招待，颇为感激。
    【又电】平保线蒋匪军，在我军连续不断的打击下，逃亡日增。我九分区蒋军退伍招待所六月份收容逃亡和投诚者一百七十名。其中有八个蒋军带来步枪八支、子弹六百多粒。
    【又电】冀中解放军官教导队三百名学员参加人民解放军，于七月十日开赴前线与蒋匪奋战。行前该队举行盛大欢送会，参军代表刘树芬说：“今天我们戴上了光荣帽，做了人民解放军；到前方去以后，要多杀敌人多捉俘虏多缴枪，不打败蒋介石誓不回家。”
    【察哈尔电】在人民解放军巨大胜利的震慑下，蒋匪士气日益低落，加以我方积极争取瓦解，向我投诚的蒋军已由士兵发展到下级军官。山岳五分区七月上半月共收容投诚蒋军一百三十七名，其中有两个指导员，一个中慰副官，超出二、三两月投诚人数的总和。据投诚蒋军说：开会、大点名、过节及出勤作战都成了逃跑的良机。在五月节那一天，新二军三十一师一团三营新兵十一连，连排长都唱得酩酊大醉，经新兵王玉文鼓动，一个排就跑了三十多个，剩下的只有排长和班长。同日，驻涿县之九十四军四十三师机炮连士兵趁该连长酒醉，一夜跑了十多人。
