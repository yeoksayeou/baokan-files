　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS, Moscow, 3rd: *Labor News* recently published an article entitled "The Chinese Working Class is Struggling for Unity," commenting on the new situation in the Chinese workers' movement, stating that the upcoming establishment of a unified Chinese democratic trade union will further advance the Chinese working class and working people on the road to realizing their goals, and further unite and strengthen China's democratic forces. After recounting the completely different situations suffered by workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas, the article pointed out that workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are intensifying their struggle to improve living standards, achieve national independence and freedom, and promote democratic construction; while in the liberated areas, the main purpose of trade unions is to assist in the development of industry and establish an economy that not only meets the needs of the liberation war but also improves the living standards of the working people. The article stated that despite the different living conditions and struggles of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas, and despite the different strategies of trade unions in the two regions, the Chinese working class still has a common goal, namely, to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland and ensure democracy, peace, and economic construction. Without these, the lives of the working people cannot be improved.

　　苏劳动报评劳动大会
  　中国工人更加团结
    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科三日电，劳动报顷发表题为“中国工人阶级在为团结而斗争”的文章，评论目前中国工人运动的新形势称：行将到来的统一的中国民主职工会的成立，将使中国工人阶级和劳动人民在实现其奋斗目标的道路上更加前进，并进一步地团结和加强中国的民主力量。该文于历述国民党统治区工人与解放区工人所遭受的两种完全不同的情形后，指出国民党统治区的工人正在为争取生活标准的改善、国家的独立与自由以及民主建设而加强斗争；而在解放区，职工会的主要目的则是协助发展工业与建立一种不仅能适应解放战争的需要而且也能提高劳动人民生活水平的经济。该文称：尽管国民党统治区与解放区工人的生活条件和斗争不同，尽管两地区职工会的策略不同，中国工人阶级仍有一个共同目标，即保卫他们祖国的独立和自由，保证民主、和平和经济建设。没有这些，劳动人民的生活就不能改善。
