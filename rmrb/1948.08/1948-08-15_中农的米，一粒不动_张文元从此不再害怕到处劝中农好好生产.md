[Taihang News] Zhang Wenyuan, a villager from Deyi Village, Lingchuan, has a family of fourteen, cultivates fifty mu of land, owns seven rooms, three head of livestock, and over a hundred sheep. The whole family labors, having used half a hired hand, employing them for four years, with no other exploitation. After the village was liberated in 1945, a rent reduction struggle was launched. Zhang Wenyuan feared the struggle, and in 1946, he voluntarily contributed five mu of land, mobilized two head of livestock, ninety-five sheep, and thirty shi of grain. After contributing these things, he felt more settled and his production was fairly active. After the promulgation of the Land Law, he became afraid again, hiding two vats of millet in a cave in the ground, constantly fearing discovery, unable to sit or sleep in peace. When class status was determined, he was classified as a prosperous middle peasant. He mistakenly believed that prosperous middle peasants were still semi-feudal and was terrified, still not daring to retrieve the millet. This May, the millet buried in the ground was discovered by children herding cattle. Village cadres convened a mass meeting to explain the Party's land reform and production policies, stating that whoever's millet it was could take it back, and no one would take a single grain from him. Zhang Wenyuan hesitantly said the millet was his. The cadres and masses explained to him the principle of unity and production, telling him to take the millet back and if there was anything else buried elsewhere, to quickly take it home to prevent it from spoiling. After the meeting, Zhang Wenyuan went home and said to his wife and brother, "Everyone knows about the millet we hid." The whole family was stunned. Zhang Wenyuan immediately reported the proceedings of the meeting to them, and the whole family was delighted, immediately taking the millet back from the ground. Their enthusiasm for production increased from then on. The whole family, young and old, went out to collect manure, and the topdressing of manure on the autumn seedlings had reached 360 loads. The land had generally been hoed three times. He took the initiative to explain to other middle peasants: Produce well, and don't be afraid anymore. After the collective implementation of the middle peasant policy towards Zhang Wenyuan, the production enthusiasm of the masses in the whole village has been greatly enhanced. This year, the village has more than 2,000 mu of land, and the topdressing of manure has reached more than 9,600 loads. The autumn seedlings have generally been hoeed twice, and now topdressing of manure and hoeing a third time is being carried out in full swing.

　　中农的米，一粒不动
  　张文元从此不再害怕到处劝中农好好生产
    【太行讯】陵川德义村村民张文元，家里共十四口人，种五十亩地，房屋七间，牲口三头，羊一百多只。全家劳动，用过半个雇工，雇了四年，没有别的剥削。一九四五年该村解放后，开展了减租斗争，张文元怕斗争，在一九四六年自动献出五亩地，动员牲口两头，九十五只羊，三十石粮食。献了这些东西，他心里较为安定下来，生产尚称积极。土地法颁布后，他又害怕起来，把两缸小米藏到地里的窑洞内，每天怕别人发觉，坐卧不安。划阶级时划成富裕中农，他误认为富裕中农还是半封建，他骇怕了，小米还不敢拿回来。今年五月，埋在地里的小米被放牛儿童发现了，村干部为这件事召开了群众大会，说明我党土改政策与生产政策，提出这是谁的小米，可以拿回，没有人要他一粒。张文元吞吞吐吐地说出小米是他的，干部和群众就向他解说团结生产的道理，告诉他把小米拿回去，如果其他地方还有埋藏着的，也赶快拿回家去，免得埋坏了。散会后张文元回家，向老婆和哥哥说：“咱们藏的小米被大家知道了。”全家吓得发了呆。张文元马上向他们报告了开会的情形，全家人都高兴了，立刻把小米从地里拿回来。生产劲头从此提高，全家老幼出去拾粪，秋苗上的追粪已达三百六十担。地都普遍锄了三遍。他主动向其他中农解释：好好生产吧，以后可别骇怕了。在对张文元集体执行中农政策后，全村群众生产情绪已经大大提高，今年全村土地二千多亩，上追粪达九千六百余担，秋苗普遍锄了两遍，现在正轰轰烈烈上追粪锄三遍。
