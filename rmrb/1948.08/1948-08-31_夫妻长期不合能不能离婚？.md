　　Can a Marriage Be Dissolved Due to Long-Term Discord?
    Editor:
    There is a woman in Yulingou Village, Eighth District, Xingtai. When she was twelve years old, her father arranged a marriage for her. After seven years of marriage, the couple has been incompatible, and the mother-in-law has been abusive. The woman filed for divorce in September last year, but it was not granted. Now the woman is filing for divorce again and demanding to take away her share of the land. However, the man firmly refuses to divorce without giving any reason. The woman is helpless and even attempted suicide. As a result, they quarrel several times a day, and mediation is ineffective. In this situation, can a divorce be granted? Can the land be taken away?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Li Zhiling, Wang Jianquan
    △ Answer: According to government decrees, both men and women have the right to file for divorce under certain circumstances. In the case of the woman in Yulingou Village, if the marriage was indeed arranged by the family, and the couple has long-term discord coupled with abuse from the mother-in-law, there are ample grounds for filing for divorce. After the divorce, the share of land obtained during the land reform can be taken away, but land that was not allocated cannot be taken away.

　　夫妻长期不合能不能离婚？
    编辑同志：
    邢台八区鱼鳞沟村有一妇女，在十二岁上由父亲主婚给她找了个婆家，结婚七年来，夫妇感情不合、婆母虐待，女方在去年九月即提出离婚，但没有离了，现在女方又提出离婚，并要求带走本人一份土地，男方却坚决不离，也不说啥理由，女方无奈，还上了一次吊，因此每天吵闹几次，调解无效。象这种情况是否能离婚？土地是否能带走？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　李志玲、王建泉
    △答：根据政府法令，男女双方在一定情况下均有提出离婚之权利，象鱼鳞沟村这个妇女，如确系家庭主婚，夫妇长期不合又加婆婆虐待，提出离婚是完全有理由的。离婚后，土改中分得的一份土地可以带走，不是分得的不能带走。
