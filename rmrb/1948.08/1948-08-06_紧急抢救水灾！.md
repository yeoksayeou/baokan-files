    Urgent Rescue from Flood Disaster!
    Recently, many areas have suffered from floods due to the surge of river water. According to reports, about 350 villages in 13 counties including Zhao County, Ningjin, and Gaocheng in central Hebei have been affected by floods; the flood-stricken areas in southern Hebei reach 17 counties, accounting for about two-fifths of the counties in southern Hebei. Taihang and Hebei-Shandong-Henan areas have also suffered from floods, many fields and crops have been submerged, houses have collapsed, and the masses have suffered extremely serious losses. In autumn, there is more rain, and areas prone to floods are still at risk of expanding floods. Therefore, at present, rescuing floods, resettling victims, and strengthening flood prevention work have become extremely urgent tasks.
    In the heavy rain, many leading organs have urgently instructed local cadres to pay attention to flood prevention and dike protection, or, after being submerged, actively organize and lead the masses to rush to rescue and block breaches, fighting against the flood. For example, the ninth commissioner of central Hebei led county, district, and village cadres to the dikes to guide flood prevention when the river water surged; the main leading cadres such as the county party secretary and county magistrate of Longyao and other places in southern Hebei also personally went to the river dikes to lead the masses to rush to block breaches, and fifteen villages in Ningnan rescued 800 hectares of green crops, which is very good. However, the leading cadres in some other areas lack a mass perspective and have a fluke and麻痹 mentality. They do not pay enough attention to the flood problem that has harmed the lives and property of millions of people. They have not prepared flood prevention equipment, nor have they organized rescue teams in advance, so that when the flood strikes, they are at a loss and cannot carry out rescue in time; even in Gaocheng, where the flood has already caused a disaster, they are still holding non-urgent meetings in the county. This cannot be regarded as a momentary negligence, but a manifestation of a lack of a sense of responsibility for the interests of the people, and should be severely condemned and criticized.
    Now the threat of floods still exists. In addition to making efforts to carry out the aftermath work in the disaster-stricken areas, we must still be very vigilant against the attack of new floods after the autumn rain. Any underestimation of the seriousness of the flood, and any麻痹, fluke, and bureaucratic attitudes are not allowed at all. In some areas, the river water is still rising, and in some areas, the dangerous sections of the river dikes have not been repaired yet, and many victims are in urgent need of relief. Therefore, the leading comrades in the river flood areas and disaster-stricken areas should quickly mobilize, prevent floods and block breaches, and rescue floods with high enthusiasm and a spirit of responsibility to the people. In areas where rivers are overflowing or submerged, emergency plugging or embankment construction should be carried out along the water, or ditches should be dug to drain water, and all methods should be used to prevent continued rise or reduce the submerged area. And we should overcome the problem of each village being self-centered and emphasizing unity, joint rescue and flood prevention, and jointly fight against the flood; places that have not been affected by the disaster but may be affected should prepare early, be vigilant, and pay attention to understanding the water situation. All disaster-stricken areas should quickly organize the rescue of victims, carry out self-rescue and mutual assistance and mutual relief movements, and the government should distribute relief loans and food to vigorously support the masses in finding other ways of life.

### 紧急抢救水灾！

    紧急抢救水灾！
    近日不少地区，因河水猛涨，泛滥成灾。据报导，冀中赵县、宁晋、藁城等十三县，约有三百五十余村遭受水患；冀南水灾地区则达十七个县，约占冀南县份五分之二。太行、冀鲁豫亦有不少地区遭受水患，许多田禾被淹，房屋倒塌，群众损失极为严重。秋季雨多，易遭水灾地区，水患仍有扩大之虞，因此，在目前，抢救水灾，安置灾民以及加强防泛工作，已成为当前十分紧急的任务。
    大雨中，许多领导机关曾紧急指示各地干部注意防汛护堤，或在被淹后，积极组织领导群众抢险堵口，与水灾作斗争。如冀中九专员在河水猛涨时率领县区村干部亲自上堤指导防汛；冀南隆尧等地县委书记县长等主要领导干部，也亲临河堤领导群众抢堵决口，宁南十五村即抢救出青苗八百顷，这都是很好的。但另有些地区的领导干部，缺乏群众观点，存有侥幸麻痹心理，对危害了数百万人民生命财产的水灾问题没有足够重视，防泛器材未作准备，抢险队也未预先组织，致洪水袭来，手足无措，不能及时进行抢救；甚至象藁城，大水已经成灾，仍在县开不紧急的会，这些不能认为是一时疏忽，而是对人民利益缺乏责任心的表现，应该受到严厉指责与批评。
    现在水灾的威胁尚在，除努力进行受灾区的善后工作外，仍要十分警惕秋雨后新水灾的袭击，任何对水灾的严重性估计不足，存有麻痹侥幸和官僚主义态度都是丝毫不能容许的。有些地区河水仍在续涨，有些地区河堤险工决口仍未抢修完，不少灾民急待救济，因此，各河汛区被灾区的领导同志应迅速动员起来，防汛堵口，抢救水灾，以高度的热情和对人民负责的精神来担负这一工作。在河水泛滥或被淹地区应紧急抢堵或沿水筑堤，或挖沟泄水，用一切办法防止续涨或减少被淹面积。并应克服村本位主义的各顾各的毛病，强调团结统一，联合抢救与防汛，共同向水灾作斗争；未被灾而可能波及的地方，则应早作准备，提高警惕，注意了解水情。所有被灾区，应迅速组织抢救灾民，开展自救与互助互济运动，政府应发放救贷粮款，大力扶植群众找其他生活门路。
