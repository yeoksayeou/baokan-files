    Taiyue Administrative Office Improves Study Methods
    Everyone Start the Machines
    Pay Attention to Connecting with Reality
    [Taiyue News] In early July, the branch of the Administrative Office examined the problems with cadre study in June, mainly the weakness of ideological leadership, which led to little progress in learning. Starting in July, administrative leaders personally served as study group leaders, with deputy leaders to assist in guidance. Study groups were organized into Group A and Group B according to educational level. There were also improvements in study methods. In the past, Group B's study involved a comrade with a higher level of education explaining the documents, and everyone just listened without offering any opinions. Now, everyone first reads the documents themselves, asking questions if they don't understand, and the whole group takes turns reading and explaining. After the explanation, everyone discusses and studies together, which makes everyone's minds move and they begin to feel interested. The comrades in Group A are exploring how to connect study with actual work with great enthusiasm, with administrative leaders personally participating, making the study much more lively and enriching. They have now finished reading the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and rectification for 1948 and the People's Daily inaugural editorial. Each group is synthesizing the issues and preparing for discussion.

    太岳行署改进学习办法
    大家开动机器
    注意联系实际
    【太岳讯】七月初，行署机关支部检查出六月份干部学习的毛病，主要是思想领导薄弱，致使学习成绩不大。七月份开始，行政负责同志亲自担任学习小组长，另设副组长帮助领导。学习组织，按文化程度分为甲乙两组。学习方法上也有改进。过去乙组学习是由一个文化较高的同志去讲解文件，大家光听，也不提什么意见；现在是每个人先自己看文件，不懂就问，全组人轮流着读和讲解，讲完后大家圪扯研究，这样使大家思想都动起来，开始感到有兴趣。甲组同志则以极大热情摸索着联系实际工作，行政负责同志亲自参加，使学习生动丰富了许多。现已把中央关于一九四八年的土改政党指示及人民日报创刊社论阅读完毕，各组正综合问题，准备讨论。
