Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th. A correspondent summarized the valiant combat of the Central China People's Liberation Army's offensive from June 15th to July 15th, stating: The People's Liberation Army's Northern Jiangsu Corps and local armed forces, from the end of April to June 15th, over fifty days, shattered the large-scale "pursuit and suppression" of the Chiang bandit Huang Botao and Zhang Xuezhong's two corps, four reorganized divisions, in the Northern Jiangsu area, eliminating 14,000 enemy troops. They then launched a major offensive against the enemy. They successively launched powerful offensives on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the outskirts of Lianghuai (Huaiyin, Huai'an), recovering the three county seats of Lianshui, Siyang, and Suqian, and more than forty large and small towns such as Zhongxing, Yanghe, Yugou, and Dayishan, eliminating more than 12,400 enemy troops. Currently, the vast plain of 200,000 square li south of the Longhai Railway, north of Hongze Lake, Baoying, Xinghua, and Dongtai line, east of Sixian and Suining, and directly to the banks of the Yellow River, except for a few isolated strongholds such as Huai'an, Huaiyin, Donghai, and Guanyun, is completely under our control, including the seven county seats of Yeting, Funing, Shuyang, Lianshui, Sixian, Siyang, and Suqian. The (Nan)tong-(Gan)yu Highway stretches over 500 li from the northern suburbs of Dongtai to the southern suburbs of Guanyun, and the canal line stretches over 280 li from the northern suburbs of Huaiyin to the Longhai Railway.

In mid-June, the Chiang bandit army's Huang Botao and Zhang Xuezhong's two corps' Reorganized 25th Division, Reorganized 72nd Division, and Reorganized 83rd Division moved north to aid Yanzhou and west to aid Yudong. The Reorganized 4th Division also hurriedly moved south to reinforce due to an offensive launched by a part of our Northern Jiangsu Corps in the coastal area. A part of our Northern Jiangsu Corps then launched an offensive on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and both sides of the (Shu)yang-Xin(anzhen) Highway on the 21st and 22nd, clearing all enemy strongholds between (Dong)hai, (Guan)yun, and (Shu)yang for the first time, liberating the towns of Xinba and other towns on the outskirts of Donghai and Xinpu, which had suffered under the rule of Japanese puppets and Chiang bandits for more than ten years, and killing the notorious puppet bandit Zhou Degan, the current colonel security brigade captain of the puppet Jiangsu Province's Eighth Special Office and concurrently the border defense commander of (Dong)hai, (Guan)yun, and (Shu)yang counties. At the beginning of this month, the People's Liberation Army once again took advantage of the victory to advance towards the outskirts of Lianghuai on the canal line, capturing Lianshui on the 6th, eliminating the entire 486th Regiment of the 162nd Brigade of the Chiang bandit's Reorganized 44th Division and most of the puppet Lianshui Security Regiment. On the 10th, they captured Yugou on the Huai(yin)-Si(yang) Highway, and on the 11th, they captured Zhongxing, an important town on the canal line, eliminating the entire regiment of the 12th Brigade of the 25th Division and four squadrons of the puppet Siyang Security Team. That night, a part of the enemy's Provisional 25th Division in Suqian, led by the traitorous division commander Sun Liangcheng, fled in panic, and the city was recovered by us. The Jianghuai Military Region's armed forces also coordinated in the battle, recovering the old site of Siyang County, and capturing strongholds such as Yanghe and Cangji. At this point, the enemies of Lianghuai were completely exposed to the spearhead of the People's Liberation Army. Prior to this, the Jianghuai Military Region's armed forces also cut off the Su(xian)-Gu(zhen) section of the Jinpu Railway in late June, captured Zhangshanjji, eighty li southeast of Xuzhou, and took advantage of the victory to eliminate five companies of the enemy, beginning the restoration of the Pi(xian)-Sui(ning)-Tong(shan) triangle area. The Huainan local armed forces attacked the Tian(chang)-Yang(zhou) Highway and captured strongholds such as Dayishan.

The Chiang army's Reorganized 4th Division and Reorganized 21st Division in the Central Jiangsu area once again occupied the outskirts of Qidong, and several important strongholds on the Kou(an)-Tai(zhou) line and the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line, and carried out "sweeps" in some local areas. The Reorganized 51st Division also cooperated with a part of the naval armed forces in the Huai'an and Baoying water network areas east of the canal to carry out "encirclement and suppression." In the early part of this month, fearing the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army in Northern Jiangsu, and the attacks of the local armed forces in Central Jiangsu, the enemies at strongholds such as Qutang and Baimi on the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line, and Fenggucun, Caodian, Sheyang, and Taolin on the Huai'an and Baoying lines, all hurriedly withdrew, and the "encirclement and suppression" plan was aborted. Our local armed forces, in addition to cooperating with the main force in combat, also advanced into the enemy-occupied areas and "encirclement and suppression" areas to wipe out local Chiang elements. Now, the democratic regime of five districts has been rebuilt in North Su (newly established county north of Suqian), and the area east and west of the Yanhai River in Guanyun County has been connected into one piece. The local armed forces in Rugao, Taixing, and Jingjiang also fought a battle on the Ru(gao)-Xin(sheng Port) line on the 8th of this month, capturing alive 156 people including Yi Yanji, deputy battalion commander of the 435th Regiment of the 145th Brigade of the Reorganized 21st Division.

Overall, in this month, our Central China military and civilians launched a major offensive against the enemy, recovering lost territory, and successively shattering the enemy's small-scale and short-lived desperate "sweeps" and "encirclement and suppression" in local areas of Central Jiangsu. This situation is even more favorable for us to continue to seek opportunities to eliminate the enemy in the future.

    华中我军一个月攻势作战
    连克三城收复广大地区
    陇海路南我控制叶挺等七座县城
    【新华社华东二十四日电】分社记者综述六月十五日至七月十五日华中解放军攻势勇战经过称：解放军苏北兵团及地方武装，从四月底到六月十五日五十天中，打破了蒋匪黄伯韬、张雪中两兵团四个整编师在苏北地区大规模的“追剿”，歼敌一万四千人之后，即大举向敌进攻。先后在陇海东段、两淮（淮阴、淮安）外围发动强大攻势，收复涟水、泗阳、宿迁三座县城及众兴、洋河、渔沟、大伊山等大小市镇四十余处，歼敌一万二千四百余人。目前陇海路以南、洪泽湖、宝应、兴化、东台一线以北，泗县、睢宁以东，直抵黄河之滨，纵横二十万方里之广大平原，除淮安、淮阴、东海、灌云等几个孤立据点外，完全为我控制，其间包括叶挺、阜宁、沭阳、涟水、泗县、泗阳、宿迁七座县城，（南）通（赣）榆公路东台北郊至灌云南郊五百余里，运河线淮阴北郊至陇海路二百八十余里。
    六月中旬，蒋匪军黄伯韬、张雪中两兵团之整二十五师、整七十二师、整八十三师北援兖州及西援豫东，整四师亦因我苏北兵团一部队沿江地区发动攻势，急忙南调增援。我苏北兵团一部乃于二十一、二十二日在陇海东段及（沭）阳新（安镇）公路两侧展开攻势，扫清（东）海（灌）云（沭）阳间全部敌据点，首次解放东海、新浦外围遭受日伪蒋匪统治十余年的新坝等市镇，并击毙著名伪匪现任伪江苏省第八专署上校保安大队长兼（东）海、（灌）云、（沭）阳三县边防指挥官周逆德乾。本月初解放军复乘胜挺向运河线之两淮外围，六日克涟水，歼蒋匪整四十四师一六二旅四八六团全部及伪涟水保安团大部，十日克淮（阴）泗（阳）公路之渔沟，十一日克运河线上之要镇众兴，歼敌二十五师十二旅一团全部及伪泗阳保安队四个中队，是晚宿迁敌暂二十五师一部在师长孙逆良诚率领下慌忙逃窜，该城逐为我收复。江淮军区武装亦于同时配合作战，收复泗阳县城旧址，攻克洋河、仓集等据点。至此，两淮敌人完全暴露于解放军矛头之前。在此之前，江淮军区武装并于六月下旬先后切断津浦路宿（县）固（镇）段，攻克徐州东南八十里之张山集，乘胜歼敌五个连，开始恢复邳（县）睢（宁）铜（山）三角地带。淮南地方武装则袭击天（长）扬（州）公路，攻克大仪山等据点。
    苏中地区蒋军整四师、整二十一师曾重占启东外围，口（岸）泰（州）线、海（安）泰（州）线的几个重要据点，并在局部地区进行“扫荡”。整五十一师亦在运河以东淮安、宝应水网地区配合水上武装一部进行“清剿”。本月上旬慑于解放军在苏北之胜利攻势，及苏中地方武装之出击，海（安）泰（州）线之曲塘、白米，淮安、宝应之凤谷村、曹甸、射阳、陶林等据点敌人均匆忙撤退，“清剿”计划乃告破产。我地方武装除配合主力作战，更挺进敌占区与“清剿”区扫荡土蒋，现宿北（宿迁北新设县）已重建五个区的民主政权，灌云县盐河东西地区已联成一片。如皋、泰兴、靖江地方武装并于本月八日在如（皋）新（生港）线一战，活捉整二十一师一四五旅四三五团副营长译延吉以下一百五十六人。
    总观这一月，我华中军民向敌大举进攻，收复失地，并相继打破敌人在苏中局部地区之小规模而又为时短促的挣扎性的“扫荡”、“清剿”，这一形势已更有利于我今后继续寻机歼敌。
