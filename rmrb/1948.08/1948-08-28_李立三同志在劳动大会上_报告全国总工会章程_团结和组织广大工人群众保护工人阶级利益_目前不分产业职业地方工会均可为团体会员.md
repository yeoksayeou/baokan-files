Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th. Comrade Li Lisan reported on the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at the Labor Congress on the 13th. The constitution is divided into five chapters: General Principles, Membership, Organization, Funding, and Supplementary Provisions. Comrade Lisan first explained that the national situation has undergone new changes, and the workers' movement is facing new tasks. Therefore, there must also be new changes in organizational form to adapt to the development of the new situation and complete more significant historical tasks. He went on to explain that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, since its establishment in 1922, has been a mass organization of the Chinese working class. It passed the Trade Union Constitution in the First Labor Congress, and it has been slightly revised in subsequent labor congresses due to the development of the situation. However, the development and changes in today's situation are very different from the situation twenty years ago. Today's China has been divided into two absolutely opposite regions. In the liberated areas, workers have participated in the government, and the working class has become the leading class of the government. Workers enjoy various democratic freedoms of publication, speech, assembly, and association. Not only are the democratic rights of the working class and all working people guaranteed by law, but there are also various material guarantees from the government. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the oppression suffered by the working class is a hundred times more severe than during the time of the Northern Warlords. Therefore, the constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should be revised based on this new situation.

Comrade Lisan then reported on the general principles of the constitution, the first of which is to restore the glorious historical name – to be named "All-China Federation of Trade Unions." Because this conference includes the entire country in terms of region and industry, and the Labor Association has also participated, this symbolizes the united solidarity of the national democratic trade unions. This is a truly national conference and the highest leading body of the working class. He then reported that the purpose of the trade union is to unite and organize the broad masses of workers and protect the interests of the working class. However, current interests should be subordinate to the long-term interests of striving for the final liberation of the working class, and the two must be unified. The working class today should unite with all classes in the country struggling for democracy, unite with all oppressed working people around the world, thoroughly overthrow the enslavement of China by American imperialism and its running dog Kuomintang reactionaries, and strive for the liberation of the people of the whole country and the protection of world peace and democracy.

Regarding the issue of membership, Comrade Lisan proposed that we advocate establishing trade unions based on industrial units, but this is not possible in China at present. Therefore, trade unions regardless of industry, professional trade unions, and local trade unions can all participate in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as group members. If the situation develops in the future, then industrial trade unions will be the foundation. Anyone who works in enterprises, institutions, and schools, whose main source of income is labor (physical and mental), and who has legally obtained employee status can join the trade union affiliated with this association as a member. However, whether or not to join should be based on the principle of individual voluntarism.

　　李立三同志在劳动大会上
  　报告全国总工会章程
    团结和组织广大工人群众保护工人阶级利益
    目前不分产业职业地方工会均可为团体会员
    【新华社东北二十五日电】李立三同志十三日在劳动大会上报告中华全国总工会章程。章程共分总纲、会员、组织、经费、附则等五章。立三同志首先说明全国形势有了新的变化，工人运动面前摆着新的任务，因此在组织形式上也必须有新的改变，以适应新形势发展，完成更重大的历史任务。他继说明，中华全国总工会自一九二二年成立时起，即是中国工人阶级的群众组织。它在第一次劳动大会中，曾通过了工会章程，后在历次的劳动大会上，因形势的发展也稍曾修改，但今天形势的发展与变化和二十年前的情况很不相同了。今天的中国，已经分成两个绝对相反的区域，在解放区内，工人参加了政权，工人阶级成为政权的领导阶级，工人享受出版、言论、集会、结社各种民主自由，不仅有法律保障工人阶级和所有劳动人民的民主权利，且还有政府多方面的物质上的保证；而在国民党统治区工人阶级所受的压迫，比从前北洋军阀时还要厉害百倍。因此全总章程应根据这种新的情况加以修改。
    立三同志继即报告章程总纲，首先是恢复历史上的光荣名称——定名为“中华全国总工会”。因为此次大会，无论在地区与产业上都包括了全国，劳动协会也参加了，这象征着全国民主工会一致的团结，这是真正全国性的大会，是工人阶级的最高领导机关。他继即报告工会宗旨是团结和组织广大工人群众，保护工人阶级利益。但目前利益应服从争取工人阶级最后解放的长远利益，二者必须统一起来，工人阶级今天应联合全国为民主奋斗的各阶层，联合全世界一切被压迫的劳动人民，彻底推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动集团对中国的奴役统治，为争取全国人民的解放、保障全世界和平与民主而奋斗。
    关于会员问题，立三同志提出，我们是主张以产业单位为基础建立工会的，但目前中国情况还办不到，故应不分产业工会，职业工会，地方工会均可参加全总为团体会员。如将来情势发展，则以产业工会为基础。凡在企业、机关、学校工作，以劳动（体力与脑力）收入为生活主要来源，并依法取得职工成份者，都可加入本会所属之工会为会员，但加入与否，应以各人自愿为原则。
