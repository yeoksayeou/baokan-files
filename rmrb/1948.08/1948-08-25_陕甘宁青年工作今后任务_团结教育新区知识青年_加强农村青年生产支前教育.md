Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Youth Federation convened a joint meeting of directors of youth federations from various sub-districts and representatives of youth from all walks of life in the Yan'an area in mid-July to discuss the development of the Northwest youth movement and to establish a preparatory committee for the New Democratic Youth League, strengthening the work of building the League in various parts of the Border Region. Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, and Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary, both attended the meeting and gave important instructions. The meeting pointed out that since the establishment of the Youth League organization in September 1946, more than 6,000 active and advanced young men and women have joined the League throughout the Border Region, creating many moving model deeds in work, study, production, and war. In addition, during the fifteen months of revolutionary war, 573 Youth League members voluntarily took the lead in joining the main force corps. Another 440 Youth League members honorably joined the Party.

The meeting reviewed the deviations existing in the Border Region's youth movement. In some areas, the League organization has not yet more broadly united the youth, and has not organized the vast number of youth to participate in various activities in a planned way. In some areas, the establishment of the League organization was not based on the degree of awareness and needs of the youth masses at the time, but was done for the sake of building the League, making the League organization become a formality. After in-depth discussion at the meeting, and based on the fact that the population of the newly liberated areas in the Border Region now far exceeds that of the old areas, the following tasks were determined for the future: First, to develop the youth movement in the new areas, unite and educate the intellectual youth in the new areas, help them establish a worldview of serving the people, and strive for them to become new forces for the liberation and construction of the Great Northwest. Second, to consolidate the youth movement in the old areas. Rural youth should strengthen education on production and support for the front lines; intellectual youth should strengthen cultural, policy, and technical learning. Third, to strengthen the work of building the League. In areas where the League has already been established, the main tasks should be to educate League members, consolidate the organization, and unite the youth masses; in areas where the League has not yet been established, it is necessary to mobilize the youth masses to participate in various tasks of war production, and to establish the League organization based on the awareness and needs of the youth masses.

In his speech, Comrade Xi Zhongxun emphasized that a sound leadership core should be universally established in the Border Region's youth movement, and the organizational strength of the League should be fully utilized to become a powerful assistant in promoting various tasks. He also stressed the importance of using the model deeds of Youth League members in various movements to educate the broad masses of youth; the task of the Youth League is not only to consolidate the youth movement in the old areas, but more importantly to develop the work of uniting and educating the broad masses of youth in the new areas, to unite and organize all cultural and educational personnel in rural and urban areas to participate in the youth movement, and to cultivate cadres in a planned way. Comrade Zhongxun called on youth cadres to seize the opportunity to learn culture, science, and policies, and to develop a new work style of hard work, simplicity, tension, and vitality.

Comrade Ma Mingfang explained that most of the rural intellectual youth (such as primary and secondary school students) in the current Northwest new areas come from working-class families and are connected to the broad masses of workers. They deeply resent and are dissatisfied with the enemy's conscription, corvée, and exorbitant taxes. Therefore, rural youth work should become a very important part of the entire youth movement. We should patiently help and educate them, and make the greatest efforts to enable them to learn the knowledge they need. After a period of training and cultivation, they will become new cadres in our various tasks. In terms of work steps, we can first do a good job in youth work in cities and densely populated areas, and then gradually expand it to rural areas.

　　陕甘宁青年工作今后任务
  　团结教育新区知识青年
    加强农村青年生产支前教育
    【新华社西北二十日电】陕甘宁边区青年联合会，于七月中旬召开了各分区青年联合会主任与延属分区各界青年代表联席会议，讨论开展西北青年运动，并成立新民主主义青年团筹备委员会，加强边区各地建团工作。西北局书记习仲勋同志、副书记马明芳同志，均到会作了重要指示。会议指出：自从一九四六年九月建立青年团的组织后，现在全边区已有六千余名积极先进的男女青年涌入团内，在工作、学习、生产、战争中，创造了许多动人的模范事迹。此外，在十五个月的革命战争中，有五百七十三名青年团员自动带头参加主力兵团。另有四百四十名青年团员光荣入党。
    会议检讨了边区青年运动中存在的偏向。在某些地区，团的组织还没有更广泛的团结青年，有计划的组织广大青年参加各种活动。在某些地区，没有根据青年群众当时的觉悟程度与需要来建立团的组织，而是为建团而建团，使得团的组织流于形式。经过会议深刻讨论，并根据边区新解放区人口已大过于老区的情况，确定了今后的任务为：第一、开展新区青年运动，团结与教育新区知识青年，帮助他们建立为人民服务的人生观，争取他们成为解放与建设大西北的新的力量。第二、巩固老区青年运动。农村青年要加强生产与支援前线的教育；知识青年要加强文化、政策与技术学习。第三、加强建团工作。已经建团地区，应以教育团员，巩固组织，团结青年群众为主要工作；尚未建团地区，则应发动青年群众参加战争生产各项工作，根据青年群众的觉悟与需要，建立团的组织。
    习仲勋同志在讲话中，强调指出：边区青年运动中应普遍建全领导核心，并充分发挥团的组织力量，成为推动各种工作的有力助手，重视以青年团员在各种运动中的模范事迹，去教育广大青年群众的领导方法；青年团的任务不仅要巩固老区的青年运动，更重要的是开展团结与教育广大新区青年的工作，团结组织农村和市镇的一切文化教育人员参加青年运动，有计划的培养干部。仲勋同志号召青年干部要抓紧学习文化、科学、政策，养成艰苦朴实、紧张活泼的新作风。
    马明芳同志说明目前西北新区农村知识青年中（如中小学生），大部出身于劳动者家庭，与广大劳动群众是有联系的。他们因深受敌人抓丁、劳役、苛捐杂税等迫害，对敌愤恨不满。因此农村青年工作应成为整个青年运动中的很重要部分。我们应耐心帮助教育他们，以最大努力使他们学到所需要的知识，经过一个时期的锻炼和培养，他们就会成为我们各项工作中的新生的干部。在工作步骤上，则可先把城市和人口集中的地区青年工作做好，再逐渐扩大到乡村中去。
