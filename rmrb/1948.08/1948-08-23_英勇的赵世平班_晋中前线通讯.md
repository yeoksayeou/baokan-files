　　Frontline Dispatch from Jinzhong
　　The Zhao Shiping Squad of the 9th Company of a certain regiment of the North China People's Liberation Army, in the Linfen siege battle, persisted in an eight-hour trench battle during the day, repelling fourteen enemy counterattacks, demonstrating the high degree of heroism and tenacity of the people's army, and won the title of model squad for trench warfare. After the battle, everyone unanimously supported Zhao Shiping as deputy platoon leader. On June 23, in the battle to annihilate Yan's Provisional 40th Division in Beiying Village, Pingyao, the squad, under the leadership of squad leader Liu Rulin and deputy squad leader Wang Qiyu, created an amazing record of a single squad eliminating an enemy mortar company. When the troops launched the assault, the squad was the first to break into the village. At that time, the enemy was still firing guns and grenades from bunkers. Deputy Squad Leader Wang Qiyu led a group to advance towards a road in the west of the village. At that time, the enemy, seeing that our army had broken into the village, scrambled northward in a chaotic manner. Wang Qiyu saw a fellow, driving a livestock, dragging a mountain gun, trying to slip out of the village, but this heavy weapon, only pulled by one livestock, was beaten to death, and it was not fast. Wang Qiyu immediately told him to stop, that guy panicked, the mountain gun also turned over, the wheels facing the sky, and then pull it could not move. Wang Qiyu shot a shot, scared the guy even fell and slipped away, the deputy squad leader took his group up and seized the mountain gun. Immediately afterwards, the group of warrior Geng Wenyuan went to the east, and the enemy on the street was running around in a panic. An enemy came face to face, and the warrior Zhao Yongcheng bravely went up and seized his gun, and prepared to kill him with the grenade in his hand, but was pulled by Geng Wenyuan. Passing by, he met two enemies with bayonets, and the bright bayonets stabbed at Geng Wenyuan. Geng shouted: "Don't move"! The enemy still took a step forward, Geng Wenyuan, while preparing to do it with his own bayonet, increased his tone: "Don't move"! With this shout, the enemy finally did not move and surrendered their guns. At this time, the battalion gave them a task, to go to the roof to solve the enemy in the yard. This is an east-west connected two yards, which contained an enemy mortar company. They accepted the task, and quickly approached the base of the wall, climbed the ladder, the enemy shot a grenade from the gun eye in the wall, and wounded squad leader Liu Rulin, warriors Cao Laibao, Li Zhizhong, and Zhao Shuicheng. Combat group leader Geng Wenyuan was also slightly injured. Squad leader Liu Rulin said to Geng: "It doesn't matter, we still have to complete the task, now is the time to make meritorious service." Geng Wenyuan also said briskly: "It's nothing, the Zhao Shiping squad can't fall behind others. Fight!" Then Wang Qiyu and warriors Liu Er, Cui Jucai and other four people went up, there was an enemy machine gun on the roof, when we went on the roof, he ignored the machine gun, and did not care how high the roof was, he jumped into the yard, they got the machine gun, and developed in two directions, Geng Wenyuan ran down the west yard from the short walls on both sides alone, Liu Rulin and warriors Liu Er, Cui Jucai went to the east roof, the enemy was mainly concentrated here, Geng Wenyuan went down, and met two enemies with bayonets, Geng Wenyuan shouted: "Surrender and don't kill!" They obediently put down their weapons. Geng immediately asked: "Are there any people inside?" They nodded, Geng Wenyuan shouted loudly to the house: "The people inside come out quickly, come out and don't kill!" Sure enough, nineteen enemies inside came out in response, holding their weapons high, in front of Geng Wenyuan's single person and gun, dare not move. That side of the deputy squad leader, when he saw the enemy jumped into the yard, he shouted: "Don't run! Stop! Don't kill!" Sure enough, five or six unarmed enemies came out. The deputy squad leader saw that the enemy had been shaken, and said: "Come out, if you don't come out, I'll kill you with grenades!" Immediately the enemies in the house came out, and the weapons were automatically placed aside. The deputy squad leader quickly entered the yard, Liu Er, Cui Jucai also followed down the roof, the enemies all stood in the yard, there was also a company commander. The four warriors asked their company commander to organize the team and count the number of people, there were seventy or eighty people.

　　英勇的赵世平班
  　晋中前线通讯
    华北人民解放军某团九连赵世平班，在临汾攻城战斗中，白天坚持八小时外壕争夺战，打退敌人十四次反扑，表现了人民军队高度的英勇顽强，荣获了争夺外壕战模范班的称号。战后，大家一致拥护赵世平当副排长。六月二十三日，平遥北营村歼灭阎匪暂四十师战斗中，该班在正副班长刘如林、王奇玉领导下，又创造了一个班解决敌人一个迫击炮连的惊人战绩。当部队发起冲锋时，该班首先突入庄子，那时敌人还从地堡里打枪和手榴弹，副班长王奇玉带着一个组首先向村西的一条道路前进。那时敌人见我军己突进庄子，纷纷向北乱窜，王奇玉见有一个家伙，赶着一匹牲口，拖着一门山炮，想溜出村去，可是这笨重的武器，只有一个牲口拖着，死命的鞭打牲口，也是走不快，王奇玉马上叫他站住，那家伙慌了，山炮也翻了，轮子朝了天，再拉也拉不动，王奇玉打过去一枪，吓得那家伙连倒带跌也溜了，副班长就带着他的组上去，缴到了山炮。紧接着该班战士耿文元的一个组由此向东边打去，街上的敌人正慌乱的跑着，迎面过来了一个敌人，战士赵永成勇敢的上去，把他的枪缴了，还准备把手里拿着的手榴弹打死他，给耿文元拉住。再过去，又碰到两个上刺刀的敌人，明恍恍的刺刀，向耿文元杀来，耿就大喊一声：“不要动”！敌人还是向前一步，耿文元一面用自己的刺刀准备着干，一面加重语气：“不要动”！这一喊，敌人终于还是不动了，把他们的枪也缴了。这时候，营里给他们一个任务，要叫上屋顶去解决院里的敌人。这是一座东西连贯的两个院子，里面有敌人的一个迫炮连，他们接受了任务，即迅速的逼近墙根，爬上梯子，敌人从围墙的枪眼里打出一棵手榴弹，把班长刘如林、战士曹来宝、李志忠、赵水成都炸伤了，战斗小组长耿文元也挂了轻伤。刘如林班长对耿说：“不要紧，咱们还是要完成任务，现在是立功的时候了。”耿文元也轻快的说：“没啥，赵世平班可不能落在人家后面。打！”说着王奇玉和战士刘二崔居财等四个人就上去了，屋顶上有敌人一挺机枪架着，当着我们上了屋，他就不顾机枪，也不管屋有多高，就往院里一跳，他们拿到了机枪，就分两头发展，耿文元一个人从两边的矮墙上跑下了西院，刘如林和战士刘二、崔居财走向东边屋顶，敌人主要集中在这里，耿文元一下去，又碰到两个上刺刀的敌人，耿文元叫了一声：“缴枪不杀！”他们就乖乖的放下了武器。耿马上即问：“里边还有人吗？”他们点点头，耿文元向房子里高喊说：“里边的人快出来，出来不杀！”果然，里边的十九个敌人应声而出，手高举着武器，在耿文元单人独枪的面前，不敢动一动，那一边的副班长，当他见敌人跳进院里就喊叫：“不要跑！站住！不杀！”果然有五六个空手的敌人出来了。副班长看见敌人已经动摇，就说：“都出来，不出来就打手榴弹打死你们！”马上屋里的敌人都出来了，武器都自动的放在一旁。副班长很快就进了院里，刘二、崔居财也就跟着下了屋顶，敌人全站在场上，里面还有一个连长。四勇士就叫他们连长整理队伍，点点人数，有七八十个人。这时候，耿文元也从西边押着俘虏过来了。
