Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 12th: Late news: During the Jinzhong campaign, over a thousand men of Yan's army's "People's Defense Force" stationed between the two ferries of Jiexiu and Lingshi, led by their Deputy Commander Guo Jingwu, gloriously revolted on July 17th, carrying over a hundred small cannons and over a thousand long and short guns. They have now arrived in a certain area of the liberated zone.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 12th: In the newly liberated areas of Fenyang and Wenshui counties in Jinzhong, the people and militia rose up in mid-July to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in capturing fleeing Yan bandits, capturing a large number. An old farmer in Xicaotou Village, Fenyang, was hoeing the ground when he saw four Yan soldiers approaching. He immediately lay down on the ground, used the hoe handle as a shooting posture, and shouted "Surrender your weapons!" The four Yan soldiers immediately laid down their weapons and surrendered. Liu Jinshou, a villager from Baijinpu, seized two rifles from the fleeing enemy and then searched everywhere, capturing 20 fleeing enemies and seizing five rifles, one light machine gun, and one light cannon. In one ambush, the militia in the third district of the county killed and captured 175 Yan bandits, seized 34 rifles, 3 light machine guns, and 4 light cannons. In Pingjie (newly established county, parts of northern Tongpu Road, Pingyao, and Jiexiu), the people of the first district captured 213 fleeing enemies in three days, seizing 115 rifles, 4 light machine guns, and 9 light cannons. The people of Ninggufou Village in the county captured over 50 fleeing enemies with just one rifle, seizing 35 long and short guns, 3 light machine guns, and 3 light cannons. Song Linchang, a farmer from Yuefeng Village in the county, and a young man from Sufeng Village were seized by fleeing Yan bandits to drive carts. They took advantage of the chaos when the Yan bandits were annihilated and drove two carts loaded with ammunition and telephone equipment back to the democratic government. Huo Yougui, an old farmer from Zaoyuantou Village, Qingyuan, was carrying tomatoes for sale. He encountered more than ten fleeing enemies by the Fen River who asked him if there were any People's Liberation Army soldiers. He put down his load and said, "This whole area is full of People's Liberation Army soldiers." The Yan soldiers looked at each other in dismay and begged Huo Yougui to lead them out. Huo Yougui said, "I'll lead you to the village and hand over your guns to the People's Liberation Army, and nothing will happen." The Yan soldiers, deceived by propaganda, were afraid of being killed if they surrendered. Huo Yougui solemnly told them, "I have personally seen the People's Liberation Army treat those who surrender their weapons leniently. I will lead you there, and if anyone is killed, kill me first." He then distributed tomatoes to the hungry and thirsty Yan soldiers. Twelve Yan soldiers immediately handed over six rifles, two submachine guns, and one light cannon.

The county and township teams "People's Defense Force" forcibly organized by Yan bandits in the rural areas of Jinzhong counties through special agent bloody means such as "soldier-peasant integration" and "self-confession and rebirth" were completely disintegrated this time. As soon as the People's Liberation Army entered Jinzhong, it launched a widespread mass movement to win over and disintegrate the "People's Defense Force," posting notices everywhere: "The 'People's Defense Force' compulsorily organized by Yan bandits, all those who hand over their weapons will be allowed to return home and live in peace, and our army and the democratic government will guarantee this." Therefore, the "People's Defense Force" fled home without fighting, or armed uprising, assisting the People's Liberation Army in annihilating Yan bandits. Their slogan is: "Take revenge on Yan Xishan and make meritorious service to atone for crimes against the people." In the first and fourth districts of Pingyao, from June 24th to July 8th, more than 340 members of the "People's Defense Force" fled home. Among them, about 100 returned with weapons. On July 8th, the militia in Nangongdi Village ambushed more than 40 members of the "People's Defense Force." As soon as they made contact, the group of the "People's Defense Force," led by squad leader An Weiyi, killed their company commander and staged an uprising. When the Yan bandits fled, they ordered the "People's Defense Force" of each village to assemble, attempting to force them to flee. However, the "People's Defense Force" in each county scattered and fled. As soon as the People's Liberation Army or democratic government personnel arrived, they surrendered with their guns. Those who were forced to flee by Yan bandits in Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Pingyao, and other counties turned their guns on the enemy as soon as they encountered the People's Liberation Army on the way. On July 11th, the remnants of Yan bandit's 44th Division were attacked by the uprising "People's Defense Force" in Ninggufou Village, Pingjie County, and captured 19 of them. On the 12th, the "People's Defense Force" attacked the Yan bandits stationed in Dongxifengluo Village and captured 9 of them.

　　阎军介休“民卫军”
    千余人光荣起义
  　晋中人民配合我军捕捉溃敌
    【新华社晋中前线十二日电】迟到消息：晋中我军大捷中，原驻介休、灵石间两渡口一带之阎军介休“民卫军”千余人，于七月十七日在其副司令郭竟武率领下，携带小炮百余门，长短枪千余支，光荣起义。现已开抵解放区某地。
    【新华社晋中前线十二日电】晋中汾阳、文水等县新区人民及民兵，上月中旬奋起配合解放军四出捕捉溃散阎匪，俘获极多。汾阳西曹头村一老农正在锄地，见四个阎兵走来，他即卧倒地上，以锄柄作射击姿态，高喊“缴械”，该四阎兵立即放下武器就擒。百金堡村民刘金寿从溃敌手中夺得二支步枪后，就四出搜索，捕捉了溃敌廿人，缴步枪五支，轻机枪和轻炮各一。该县三区民兵在一次伏击中，即毙俘阎匪一百七十五人，缴枪三十四支，轻机枪三挺，轻炮四门。平介（新设县，同蒲路北、平遥、介休各一部）一区人民在三天中，即俘获溃敌二百十三人，缴枪一百十五支，轻机枪四挺，轻炮九门。该县宁固阜村人民以一支步枪即生擒溃敌五十余人，缴长短枪三十五支，轻机枪三挺和轻炮三门。该县岳封村农民宋林长与苏封村一少年被阎匪溃退时抓去赶大车，他们都乘阎匪被歼时的混乱，把两辆满载弹药及电话器材的大车赶回送交民主政府。清源枣园头村老农霍有贵担西红柿出卖，在汾河边遇溃敌十余，向他问有没有解放军，他放下担说：“这一片都是解放军”。吓得阎兵们面面相觑，央求霍有贵把他们引出去。霍有贵说：“我把你们引到村里，把枪缴给解放军，甚事也没有。”阎兵因受欺骗教育，怕投降被杀。霍有贵即严正告诉他们：“我亲眼看着解放军对你们缴了枪的都宽大，我领你们去，要杀先杀我。”他又把西红柿分给饥渴的阎兵，十二个阎兵当即交出了六支步枪，两支冲锋枪和一门轻炮。
    阎匪在晋中各县农村以“兵农合一”、“自白转生”等特务血腥手段，强迫编成的县、乡团队“民卫军”，此次全部瓦解。解放军一进入晋中，对“民卫军”就开展广泛群众性的争取瓦解运动，遍贴布告：“阎匪强迫人民编制之‘民卫军’，凡交出武器者即准其回家安居乐业，本军与民主政府并予以保障”。因此“民卫军”未经战斗即纷纷逃散回家，或武装起义，协助解放军歼灭阎匪。他们的口号是：“向阎锡山报仇，向人民立功赎罪。”平遥一、四两区从六月二十四日到七月八日即有“民卫军”三百四十余人逃回家来。其中并有约百人携回武器。七月八日该县民兵在南官地村伏击“民卫军”四十余人，才一接触，该股民卫军即在分队长安维义率领下，打死其中队长举行起义。阎匪逃窜时本下令集合各村“民卫军”，企图裹胁带走，但各县“民卫军”多四散逃避，解放军或民主政府人员一到就携枪投诚。汾阳、孝义、平遥等县被阎匪裹胁逃窜者，途中一遇解放军即掉转枪口杀敌。七月十一日，阎匪四十四师残部逃窜途中，在平介县宁固阜村即遭起义的“民卫军”袭击，俘其十九人。十二日，该部“民卫军”又袭击驻东西凤落村阎匪，俘其九人。
