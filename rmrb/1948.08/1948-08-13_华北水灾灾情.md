    (1) Central Hebei Region: Central Hebei experienced rainfall in the latter half of July, coupled with this continuous rain, upstream mountain floods broke out, causing the rivers in Central Hebei to swell. The Hutuo River had a very strong flow this year. According to observations at the Huangbizhuang hydrological station in Pingshan, the water level reached a maximum of 100.84 meters on the 21st. On the 22nd, the Yecheng section overflowed the river channel. The next morning, Jin County was flooded, with a water depth of about three feet. The Shenze section of the river overflowed its banks. A breach more than 20 zhang wide occurred in Anyangcheng, with a water depth of four feet, flooding Anping City and many villages in Hebei. Seventeen breaches occurred in the southern levee of the Lutuo River from Anping to Raoyang, flooding forty-eight villages. On the evening of the 30th, the right bank of the Ziya River (named Ziya River after the confluence of the Hutuo River and the Fuyang River) breached at the Nan Zhaofu section of Dacheng, flooding the Jinghai Dacheng area east of the river, and water flowed into the Jia Kou depression. The Zhulong River (upstream is the Sha River) had an even stronger flow this year. On the 22nd, it breached in Xinle, flooding fifteen villages. Many villages in An'guo, both north and south of the river, were flooded. Two breaches occurred in Mengcun, Lixian County, and water has flowed to Suning.
