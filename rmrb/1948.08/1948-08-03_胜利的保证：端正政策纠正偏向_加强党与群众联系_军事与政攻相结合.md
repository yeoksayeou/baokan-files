Looking at the overall situation of the struggle, this reporter believes that fully promoting the experience of uniting the majority of the people against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War is the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory. According to materials from various regions, the following three things have been done in places where victories have been achieved: First, policies have been corrected, and the left-leaning errors that occurred in a certain period have been resolutely corrected. The main problem was carrying out land reform when conditions did not permit it, such as mechanically transplanting the "gun in one hand, land distribution in the other" everywhere, which did more harm than good. In some places, the interests of poor peasants and farm laborers were overemphasized, and the middle peasants were seriously harmed, erroneously expanding the scope of attack, creating "red-white opposition" and large-scale flight. This time, various regions held symposiums for all classes, meetings for families of those who had fled, explained our party's correct policies, and stopped land reform. The leadership made self-criticisms, called for unity to protect the wheat harvest, and in practice, returned the land and property of middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against, and resettled landlords and rich peasants. This invigorated people of all classes. In Xiuwu alone, half of the households that had fled returned. In northern Henan and central Shanxi, returnees were constantly on the road. People were spreading the word that "The Communist Party is about to win the world, and everyone is given a way to survive." Their slogan was "Go home to harvest wheat and live a good life." On this basis of unity, the wheat harvest was completed victoriously. In Liangcun, Qi County, the entire population harvested all the wheat within five days of liberation. The "self-defense teams," "wheat grabbing teams," "sickle teams," and various political deceptions organized by the Chiang, Yan, and Fu bandits were completely bankrupt. Cadres' morale increased greatly, saying: "In the past, it wasn't the enemy's sabotage, but our own mistakes. Now we are numerous and powerful, so we are insured." Second, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been adjusted, and village-level organizations have been rectified on a democratic basis. This spring, some border areas implemented erroneous methods of Party rectification, kicking aside the old organizations, and using suspension, beatings, binding, and detention indiscriminately, universally and massively, and erroneously "moving the stones." In the most serious areas, even the militia's guns were confiscated. The unified leadership organization for the struggle against the enemy—the command post—disintegrated, and veteran cadres (many of whom had experience in fighting the enemy since the Anti-Japanese War) were all suspended from their posts, creating chaos, organizational slackness, and antagonism between new and old organizations and new and old cadres. This greatly facilitated the enemy's nibbling and leaping forward. In response to the above situation, various regions successively convened meetings of cadres at all levels, explained the purpose of Party rectification, expressed support for good cadres who persisted in the struggle against the enemy and led the masses, corrected the left-leaning errors in Party rectification, criticized the right-leaning idea of "laying down weapons," and made appropriate self-criticisms for the mistakes made by the leadership, calling on cadres who had made mistakes to reform and make meritorious service. After that, various regions stopped land reform and Party rectification, and shifted the focus of work to strengthening the struggle against the enemy. Various regions promoted the experience of the Anti-Japanese War, and adjusted various organizations. Militia rotation teams and armed work teams began to become active. The Jiaozuo local armed forces and militia continuously crushed three wheat-grabbing and mopping-up operations by the Chiang bandits, enabling the entire county to complete the harvesting and threshing of more than 25,000 mu of wheat within seven days. The people's armed forces north of the Daqing River took the initiative to raid the enemy. The militia of Jinwu County bravely fought the enemy in village battles. Combining village tunnels and snipers, they killed as many as eighty enemies in one battle, creating one of the most brilliant victories in protecting the wheat harvest. The Changqing armed work team extended its activities to the border areas. In areas where border counties have done well, the county party committee secretary and county head organized guerrilla groups to launch offensives. Cadres in the first district of Jiaozuo helped the masses with production, fighting when the enemy came and producing when the enemy left, which the masses called "carrying a gun as a hired laborer." Command posts in various regions organized rotation teams, with men fighting at the front and women cutting wheat and producing. They achieved "both production and fighting without error," opened blasting training classes, and used landmine warfare to block the enemy. The counties in northern Henan and central Shanxi launched "thousand-mine movement" and "ten-thousand-mine movement," with people of all classes, men and women, old and young, actively making mines day and night, and setting up minefields, mine ditches, and mine villages, truly achieving "unity of purpose and concerted efforts to fight the enemy." Even in areas with serious enemy situations, such as Xinxian Village in Yanjin, people of all classes automatically took up knives and guns and launched an "anti-enemy movement." Third, military offensives were combined with political offensives, effectively striking the enemy. In June, the local armed forces of Hebei, Shandong and Henan annihilated more than 3,000 enemies. The militia and armed work teams of Xushui annihilated 200 enemies in just twelve days from June 10 to 22. All fronts are forcing the enemy back step by step, besieging the enemy in several isolated strongholds. Under the resolute blows of our army and people, political offensives were launched on all fronts: meetings of families of stubborn elements were held, and in many areas, puppet troops came to send intelligence, secretly communicated information, and inquired when to clean up the strongholds, preparing to cooperate from within. The Tenth Sub-district of Central Hebei established a "Chiang Army Veterans Reception Center," which received more than 1,700 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet officers and soldiers in June. One squad of the New Second Army in Baoding revolted. During the political offensive, the Land Law Outline of China and our party's various policies penetrated the hearts of the people in the Chiang Kai-shek's area, shaking the Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers. In many places, landlords and officers and soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek's area secretly came to the liberated area to make contact, expressing support for the democratic government and asking to be shown a way out. They said, "This is really getting to the bottom of things, and we must treat each other with sincerity in the future." The puppet personnel in Jiaozuo seized public grain and competed to send more.

Amidst the cheers of protecting the grain harvest and reporting victory, the increase in thoughts of underestimating the enemy and being paralyzed is alarming. According to reports from various regions, many places are saying that "the victory in protecting the wheat harvest has been completed," which means that the struggle has come to an end and they can breathe a sigh of relief. However, new tasks for fighting the enemy have not been clearly and specifically put forward. This is a dangerous phenomenon, and if it develops, it will make the struggle passive and weaken morale. Last year's experience proves that the struggle to protect the grain harvest is a long-term and arduous task. Some border areas were only satisfied with covering the victory of the summer harvest and relaxed their vigilance against large-scale grain grabbing by the enemy, which allowed the enemy to grab the ready-made wheat that had been harvested and threshed, causing even greater losses. This lesson should be given serious attention. We must strive to promote the experience of the Anti-Japanese War, expand the united front against Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan and Fu Zuoyi, and unite against the enemy, not giving the enemy a moment to breathe, and quickly expand the fruits of victory; launch military and political offensives; check the storage of grain, check door to door, pay attention to the decentralization of grain storage, and never concentrate it.

In order to successfully persist in the struggle to protect the grain harvest, various regions should carefully check and summarize the previous stage of the struggle: promote advantages, correct errors, and according to various situations, there are many problems that must be seriously solved, such as the combination of labor and military in the border areas for a longer period of time in the future, the cooperation between local armed forces and the militia in combat (many local armed forces did not play a role this time), the poor management of mine laying, resulting in harm to the masses, the establishment of social democratic order in the border areas, and the expansion of the united front against Chiang Kai-shek, all of which need to be seriously understood and systematically researched to find good solutions.

    胜利的保证：端正政策纠正偏向
    加强党与群众联系
    军事与政攻相结合
    综观整个斗争形势，记者认为：充分发扬抗日时期团结大多数人民一致对敌的经验是取得胜利的基本保证。根据各地材料证明：凡是取得胜利的地方都做了以下三种事情：第一是端正政策，坚决纠正了曾经在一个时期内所发生的左倾错误，主要的是在条件并不允许的情况下进行土地改革，如到处所机械搬运的“一手拿枪，一手分田”，坏事不少。有些地方则过分强调贫雇利益并严重地伤害了中农，错误地扩大了打击面，造成“赤白对立”及大批逃亡。这次各地都召开了各阶层座谈会，逃亡户家属会议，解释了我党正确政策，停止了土地改革。领导上做了检讨，号召团结保麦，并在实际上退还了错斗中农土地财物，安置了地主富农，这样振奋了各阶层人民，修武一地逃亡户即回来一半，豫北晋中归来者络绎于途，一传十，十传百，大家说：“共产党就是要得天下了，每个人都指给一条活路”。他们的口号是“回家收麦过时光”。在这样团结基础上胜利地突击完成麦收，祁县梁村解放不到五天全体人民就将麦子收完。蒋阎傅匪阴谋组织的“自卫队”，“抢麦队”，“镰刀队”以及各种政治欺骗完全破产。干部斗志大增，说：“过去不是敌人破害，是咱有错误，现在咱人多势众，就保险了”。第二是调整了党与群众的关系，在民主的基础上整顿了村级组织。今年春天，有些边地实行了错误地整党办法，把老组织一脚踢开，吊、打、捆、扣一齐，不分青红皂白，普遍地大量地错误的“搬了石头”。最严重的地区竟把民兵的枪都缴了。对敌斗争一元化的领导组织——指挥部解体了，老干部（其中有不少抗日战争以来对敌斗争有经验的村干）都停了职，一时造成秩序大乱，组织松懈，新老组织新老干部对立。大大便利了敌人的蚕食和跃进。针对以上情况，各地先后召开了各级干部会议，说了整党目的，表示坚持对敌斗争带领群众的好干部，既纠正了整党中的左倾错误，又批评了右倾人却“放下武器”的思想，领导上做错了的，也作了适当的自我检讨，号召犯错误的干部要改造立功。之后，各地都停止土改整党，把工作重点转为加强对敌斗争，各地都发扬抗日时期经验，调整各种组织。民兵轮战队，武工队开始活跃起来。焦作地武民兵连续粉碎蒋匪三次抢麦扫荡，使全县二万五千多亩麦子七天内完成收打。大清河北的人民武装主动的奔袭敌人，津武县民兵英勇同敌人进行村落战，一村地道冷枪结合，一次毙敌竟达八十名，创造保麦中最光辉的胜利之一。长清武工队伸出边沿区扩展活动范围。边沿各县做得好的地区，都以县委县长为首组织了游击集团展开攻势，焦作一区干部帮助群众生产，敌来就打，敌走就生产，群众称之为“背枪长工”。各地指挥部组织轮战队，男人前方打仗，女人割麦生产。做到“生产打仗两不误”，开爆炸训练班，地雷运动封锁住了敌人。豫北晋中各县都开展了“千雷运动”，“万雷运动”，各阶层男女老小日夜积极造雷，布置了雷区雷沟雷村，真正做到了“团结一条心合力打敌人”，即便在敌情严重的如延津新县村，各阶层人民也自动拿起刀枪开展了“反资敌运动”。第三是军事出击与政治攻势相结合，有力地打击了敌人，冀鲁豫地方武装六月份歼敌三千余，徐水民兵武工队从六月十日到二十二日短短十二天内就歼灭了敌人二百名。各线都步步逼退敌人，围困敌人于几个孤立据点之内。在我军民铁拳坚决打击下，各线掀起政治攻势：召开抗顽家属会议，不少地区伪军都来送情报、暗通声息，询问何时收拾据点，准备里应外合。冀中十分区成立了“蒋军退伍招待所”，六月份收容蒋伪官兵一千七百余人，保定新二军一个班起义。在政治攻势中，中国土地法大纲和我党的各种政策深入蒋区人心，动摇了蒋军官兵，许多地方蒋区地主及蒋区官兵纷纷偷来解放区接头，表示拥护民主政府并要求给指明出路。并说：“这可真摸底了，以后要将心比心。”焦作伪人员则抢缴公粮，争先多送。
    在护粮报捷声中提高警惕的是轻敌麻痹的思想似乎又在增涨。从各地报导看：很多地方都在表示“护麦胜利完成”，意味着斗争已告一段落，可以松一口气，至于新的对敌斗争任务却没有明确具体的提出来，这是一种危险现象，发展下去将会使斗争被动、斗志松懈。去年经验证明护粮斗争是一个长期而艰巨的任务，有些边沿区只满足于掩护夏收的胜利而放松了对敌人大规模抢粮的警惕，结果正好让敌人把收好打好的现成麦子抢走，造成更大损失。这一教训应引起大家严重注意，努力发扬抗日时期的经验、扩大反蒋阎傅匪的统一战线一致对敌，不给敌人一个喘息时间，迅速扩张胜利战果；开展军事政治攻势；检查藏粮，挨门挨户的查，注意藏粮的分散，千万不可集中。
    为了把护粮斗争胜利地坚持下去，各地应对上一阶段斗争认真检查和总结：发扬优点，纠正错误，根据各方情况看：有许多问题是必须认真解决的，举如今后较长时间的边沿区劳武结合问题，地武民兵配合作战问题（很多地方武装这次不起作用），埋雷管制不好，结果伤害群众的问题，建立边沿区社会民主秩序及扩大反蒋统一战线问题，都需要认真了解情况系统的加以研究，求得很好的解决。
