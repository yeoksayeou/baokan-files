　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS reports: Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, who was assassinated by US-Japanese reactionaries while giving a speech in Saga Prefecture, Kyushu Island on the 19th of last month, returned to Tokyo on the 4th. Representatives from various organizations (including Tojo, Chairman of the Postal Workers' Union, and Muto, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee to Investigate Illegal Transfer of Property) and the masses gathered at the station to welcome Tokuda. Disregarding the surveillance of fully armed American military police around them, the welcomers held a mass rally in Hibiya Park, attended by 20,000 people. At the meeting, Tokuda delivered a speech, pointing out that the assassination attempt against him marked the fragility of the ruling class. He denounced the Katayama Cabinet's impending amendment to the Civil Service Law as an attempt to sell Japan to foreign capitalists. He firmly believed that the Japanese working class, led by the Communist Party, would overcome the increasing difficulties. Upon the motion of the Japanese Technician's Union, the meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding the government to revoke the recently promulgated anti-strike order. In other news, when the train Tokuda was traveling on passed through Yokohama, the masses flocked to the station to welcome him. The police intervened, causing a conflict. The train did not dare to stop and went straight to Tokyo.

    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社报导：上月十九日在九州岛佐贺县演说时遭美日反动派凶手行刺的日共总书记德田球一，于四日返抵东京。齐集车站欢迎德田的有各团体的代表（包括递信工人工会主席土桥及议会调查财产非法转让委员会主席武藤）及群众，欢迎者不顾全付武装的美国宪兵在周围的监视，在日比谷公园举行群众大会，与会者达两万人。会上德田发表演说，指出对他的行刺，标志了统治阶级的脆弱。他斥责卢田内阁行将修正公务员法乃是意图出卖日本给外国资本家。他坚信共产党所领导的日本工人阶级将克服日益增长的困难。大会根据日本技师工会的动议，一致通过一项决议：要求政府撤销最近颁布的反罢工令。另息，当德田所乘之列车途经横滨时，群众纷纷前往车站欢迎，警察出面干涉，引起冲突，该列车到站未敢稍停即径开东京。
