Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 29th -- Yan's army soldiers liberated in the Jinzhong Campaign have successively accused Yan's bandit officers of the crime of slaughtering soldiers. Yan's bandits forced every new recruit to have "Three Guarantees," namely, a guarantor for bedding, a guarantor from the company, and a guarantor from relatives. Each squad was equipped with one or two "Iron Methyl Cadres" (Yan bandit secret service personnel) to carry out secret service rule. Soldiers were executed for even the slightest carelessness. According to Ren Zhiyao and Ding Junru, soldiers of the 208th Regiment of the former Yan Army 70th Division, Li Shuhua and Li Guilan, new recruits from the 3rd Company, were captured and returned home after missing their parents and wives and being unable to live. Lei Shiyang, the regiment commander of the regiment, then ordered the soldiers of the new recruits company to tie them to a tree and practice stabbing "living human targets," stabbing them slowly from the feet up, stabbing them to death. Yan's bandits often held "Confession and Rebirth" meetings to deal with new recruits. At one meeting of the 73rd Division's new recruit brigade, more than 20 soldiers were beaten half to death with sticks, and two were stabbed to death. Xin Wancai, a soldier of the 8th Company of the 218th Regiment of the Yan Army 73rd Division, was stabbed to death at a mass meeting of the entire regiment one night while on sentry duty because he was wearing two more pieces of clothing due to the cold, and was suspected of preparing to desert. In order to prevent soldiers from resisting or being war-weary, Yan's bandits affixed cloth seals stamped with the company commander's seal to the mouths of all hand grenades, which were not allowed to be opened casually to prevent soldiers from pouring water in to destroy them, under penalty of death. Anyone who lost bullets or failed to return empty cartridges after battle was punished as a "pseudo element." Yan's bandits further stipulated that lower-level officers had the power to kill soldiers at any time and any place. On June 14, in the battle of Liangjia Village in Xiaoyi, seven soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 217th Regiment of the Yan Bandit 73rd Division were shot and killed by the battalion and company commanders before even entering the battle. But these atrocities only aroused the soldiers to carry out more resolute resistance. In the battle of Liangjia Village, many soldiers took the opportunity to kill the battalion and company commanders they hated with black guns and then laid down their weapons. One squad of the 2nd Regiment of the 44th Division killed their platoon leader and collectively surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.

    在阎匪暴政下
    “自白转生”就是死
    阎匪抓兵又杀兵
    【新华社晋中前线二十九日电】晋中战役中解放的阎军士兵纷纷控诉阎匪军官残杀士兵的罪行；阎匪强迫每个入伍新兵，必须有“三保”即铺保、连环保、亲属保；每班设有一二个“铁甲基干”（阎匪特务人员），进行特务统治，士兵稍一不慎，即被处死。据前阎军七十师二○八团士兵任志耀、丁俊儒等称：该团三连被抓新兵李树华、李桂兰，因想念家中父母妻子无法生活，逃回家后又被抓回。该团团长雷士仰当命令新兵连士兵将他们两人捆在树上，演习刺“活人靶”，从脚下慢慢往上刺，活活刺死。阎匪对待新兵，常开“自白转生”大会，七十三师新兵大队在一次会上有二十多个士兵被乱棍打得半死，两人被刺死。阎军七十三师二一八团八连士兵辛万财某夜放哨，因天冷多穿了两件衣服，被怀疑准备开小差，当在全团大会上被刺死。阎匪为防止士兵的反战怠战，手榴弹口一律贴有连长盖章的布封条，不得随便揭开，以防士兵灌水破坏，违者处死。丢了子弹或作战后不缴弹壳，即以“伪装分子”论罪。阎匪更规定下级军官有随时随地残杀士兵的权力。六月十四日在孝义梁家庄战斗中，阎匪七十三师二一七团三营还未进入战斗，即有七个士兵被营连长枪杀。但这些暴行只引起士兵进行更坚决的反抗。梁家庄战斗中很多士兵乘机用黑枪打死他们痛恨的营连长后放下武器，四十四师二团一个班将其排长击毙后，集体向解放军投诚。
