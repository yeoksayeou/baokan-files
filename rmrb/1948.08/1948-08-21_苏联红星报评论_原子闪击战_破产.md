Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS, 14th: The Soviet Red Star newspaper recently published a war science paper by Major General Zopkov, stating: The Soviet armed forces, in their gigantic independent operations against the German army, gave the German fascist army a decisive blow and won victory. The collapse of the German war machine, shattered by the Soviet armed forces, also meant the collapse of German war theory—considered the best modern bourgeois war theory. The gambler's theory of "blitzkrieg" manufactured by German imperialist military thinkers, and the theory of "war with small armies" jointly manufactured by well-known military theorists of several bourgeois countries, have been buried in the ruins of the fascist German war machine. Short-sighted politicians in the Anglo-American imperialist camp and their specious military theorists, dreaming of another world war, are again begging for "blitzkrieg"—this time a blitzkrieg based on atomic weapons. But they completely ignore the painful lessons of World War II, which vividly demonstrated how unfounded the so-called "blitzkrieg" is. This once again shows that today's bourgeois war science has reached a dead end, unable to understand the lessons of the last world war.

　　苏联红星报评论“原子闪击战”破产
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社十四日讯：苏红星报顷载佐普科夫少将的苏联战争科学论文称：苏联武装力量在其对德军的巨人式的独立作战中，给了德国法西斯军队以决定性的打击，获得了胜利。为苏联武装力量所击碎的德国战争机构的崩溃，同样也就意味着德国战争理论——被认为近代最优秀的资产阶级战争理论——的崩溃。德国帝国主义军事思想家所制造的“闪击战”的赌徒理论，以及由若干资产阶级国家的著名军事理论家所共同制造的“小军队战争”的理论，都被埋葬到法西斯德国战争机构的废墟下了。英美帝国主义阵营中短视的政治家及其似是而非的军事理论家们，梦想着另一次世界大战，又在乞援于“闪击战”——这次是建立在原子武器基础上的闪击战，但他们却完全忽视了第二次世界大战的惨痛教训，这些教训历历如绘地证明了所谓“闪击战”是如何地毫无基础。这就再次地表示：今日的资产阶级战争科学已经走到了绝路，它不能了解上次世界大战的教训。
