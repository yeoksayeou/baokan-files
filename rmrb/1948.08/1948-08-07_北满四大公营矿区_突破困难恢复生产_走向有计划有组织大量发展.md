Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 3rd: The achievements of the four major state-owned mining areas in Northern Manchuria in resuming production over the past two years are remarkable, and they are moving towards a new era of organized and planned large-scale development. This year, the four mining areas will strive to produce five million tons of coal. The current production rate of each mine has reached an average of 0.5 tons per person per day, exceeding the 0.3 tons during the puppet Manchukuo era by two-thirds. In terms of production volume, the Second Mining Area has already reached the level before the "August 15th" liberation. The number of workers in the four mines has more than doubled since liberation, and the attendance rate (the ratio of the total number of factory and mine workers to the actual number of workers) was on average 65% at the highest during the puppet Manchukuo period, but now averages above 80% in each mine, with the First Mining Area reaching 89%. In terms of coal quality, as a result of the renovation of machinery and other equipment by the leadership departments of each mine, as well as research and inspection, the ash content in the coal has been reduced from 30% in the past to 17%. The production of coking coal not only exceeded the original target (such as the Second Mining Area exceeding the target by 176%), but also selected stones from the coal, and the coal was washed with water, with a silvery-white color, and each catty can melt more than five catties of pig iron.

The most arduous and outstanding recovery work was done by the First Mine of the Third Mining Area. This mine suffered the most severe damage when it was liberated due to the destruction by the Kuomintang army. Through the arduous efforts of all employees, 3,948 cubic meters of accumulated mud and stones were removed from the horse-powered roads; more than 30 million cubic meters of water were pumped out; more than 90 various machines were repaired; four factories including power, machinery, foundry, and sawmills were restored and built; 10,000 meters of railway for transporting coal were built; 2,839 coal trucks were repaired; 7,800 meters of gas pipes and heating pipes were restored; more than 39,000 meters of various new wires were erected; and worker clinics, libraries, and employee children's schools, as well as bathhouses and barbershops, etc., began to be established. According to statistics, the total coal reserves in Northeast China are more than 200 million tons, with more than 40 existing coal mines. Except for six mines in Fushun, Benxi, and other places, the rest are owned by the liberated areas.

    北满四大公营矿区
    突破困难恢复生产
    走向有计划有组织大量发展
    【新华社东北三日电】北满四大公营矿区两年来恢复生产的成绩卓著，正走向有组织有计划大量发展的新时期。今年四个矿区将争取产煤五百万吨。现各矿生产率已平均达每人每日产零点五吨，超过伪满时代零点三吨的三分之二；生产量方面，第二矿区已首先达到了“八一五”解放前的水平。四矿工人数目则较解放时已增加一倍多，出勤率（厂矿工人总数与实际上工人数的比率）在伪满时平均最高是百分之六十五，现在各矿则平均在百分之八十以上，第一矿区则达百分之八十九。煤质方面，由于各矿领导部门装修机器及其他设备，并进行研究与检查的结果，煤内所含灰分已由过去的百分之三十减少至百分之十七。焦煤生产不仅超过原定任务（如第二矿区超过任务百分之一百七十六），且将炭内石头选出，炭皆用水洗过，色泽银白，每斤可熔生铁五斤以上。
    恢复工作最艰巨成绩也最突出的是第三矿区第一矿。该矿解放时，遭国民党军破坏，损失最重。在全体员工的艰辛努力下，扫除马机道积泥和石头三九四八立方米；抽水三千余万立方米，修理各种机器九十余台，恢复和建筑电力、机械、翻砂、火锯等四个工厂，修建运煤铁路万米，修整煤车二八三九个，恢复气道、暖气管等七千八百余米，新架各种电线三万九千余米，并开始建立了工人医务所、图书馆及职工子弟学校以及澡堂理发店等。按全东北煤炭蕴藏量达二百万万吨以上，原有煤矿四十余个，现除抚顺、本溪等地六个矿以外，其余均归解放区所有。
