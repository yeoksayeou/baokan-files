    Failure to Promptly Inspect and Correct Deviations
    Half of Jianping Agricultural Loans Unissued
    [Special Dispatch] A report from our general branch reporters: During the Jianping County Party Committee's work conference, agricultural loan work was frequently discussed, and the initial discussion of loan figures allocated to each district was also very detailed. However, due to a lack of serious attention to specific leadership, as County Head Han said, "the momentum was not turned around." Consequently, the spirit of the resolutions could not be thoroughly implemented, and deviations were not quickly discovered and corrected. Therefore, the actual amount loaned to the masses is currently less than half of the county's total allocation. The County Production Promotion Agency is the main responsible body for agricultural loan work, but it uses twenty-three cadres for trading, leaving only five cadres responsible for agricultural loans. Among the five people, besides the head of the credit department and an accountant (who also have other tasks), one cadre specializes in exchanging banknotes, one cadre was transferred to the county party committee's training class for district and village cadres to manage meals, and one cadre is working with the industry department in Guanyintang to create an agricultural loan demonstration village. The leadership did not pay attention to summarizing and promoting the experience of this demonstration village, so although there were achievements, it remained an isolated point in the county as a whole. Aside from the industry department's cadres who went to the countryside and briefly inspected some agricultural loan situations (recently two cadres have been specifically inspecting), the county-level departments have not conducted a more general or in-depth inspection. According to the reporter's understanding, there are two approaches to district leadership work: one is that based on the agricultural loan figures allocated by the county, the main responsible cadres in the district jointly discuss and then allocate them to the villages through district representative meetings or village cadre meetings, allowing village cadres to directly control the distribution. This resulted in deviations of equal distribution and unfair distribution. For example, in the three districts, out of fifty-two administrative villages, forty-seven villages received livestock loans, with seven villages receiving 800 jin each, thirty-nine villages receiving 750 jin each, and one village receiving 350 jin. In order to prevent the dispersal of distribution in the villages, the district "limited" the number of households to be loaned in each village. Wanzi Village was loaned 2,110 jin of grain, and the district "limited" it to a maximum of sixteen households. Because it was only a "limit" without ideological work, the village cadres registered sixteen households in the district, but in reality, they distributed it to about forty families after returning to the village. Also, because the allocation was controlled by a few cadres and not subject to public discussion by the masses, some loans were very inappropriate. For example, Han Hutong had a debt of seven dou of corn outside, and was also loaned 35 jin of grain. Kong Erhuo lost sixty jin of cotton and a donkey gambling, and the village cadres loaned him 250 jin of livestock loan grain. The masses were very dissatisfied with this. In Laofengou, forty out of forty-three households were allocated loan grain, with more than ten households receiving ten jin of grain each, and several households receiving only two jin of grain per person, which solved no one's problems. In Qiubo Cave, in the seventh district, the first loan of grain was distributed to forty households per capita. Households with more people received two jin per person, and households with fewer people received three jin per person. One thousand jin of livestock loan grain was taken away by four households with livestock without discussion by the public, and those without livestock could not get a loan even if they wanted to. The secretary of the Party Committee of the Third District believes that the reason why agricultural loans were not done well is: "There is no typical demonstration, no specific organizational leadership, and no inspection. The district cadres did other work." (The production promotion agency offices stationed in each district are also mainly engaged in supply and marketing. The leadership of agricultural loan work, except for the director jointly allocating figures to the villages with the district committee and district head, is only responsible for handling procedures). According to the head of the Industry Department, such villages where the above-mentioned deviations occurred due to leadership negligence are mostly in the Third and Seventh Districts. Another method of distribution is to emphasize lending to organized masses (this is how the county initially arranged it,) and not to distribute loans if they are not organized. The cadres did not specifically lead how to organize. As a result of this work in the Sixth District, out of 65,920 jin of grain allocated this year, only more than 4,370 jin were loaned to households as of July 10. The masses who demanded grain loans could not get it because they were not "organized." In addition, the county allocated agricultural loans to the districts into four categories: production assistance, livestock, textiles, and agricultural implements, each with specific figures, emphasizing the dedicated use of funds. The Fourth District allocated 19,200 jin of livestock loan grain and 25,000 jin of production assistance grain. As a result, the production assistance grain was used up and was not enough, and the livestock loan grain could not be distributed. Transferring the funds required county approval, which also affected the rapid distribution of agricultural loans. The grain loaned to the Second District was stored in Xiazai and Mayu in the First District. The round trip was forty to one hundred li, which increased the difficulty for the masses in the Second District to obtain loans. As of July 10, the number of loans distributed to households throughout the county was less than one-half of the total allocation of the county. (Chai Fu)

### 没有及时检查纠正偏向  建屏农贷半数未发

    没有及时检查纠正偏向
    建屏农贷半数未发
    【本报特讯】总分社记者报导：建屏县委工作会议中，对农贷工作经常论及，头次向各区分农贷数字时的讨论也很详尽，但由于没有认真注意具体领导，即韩县长所说“没有扭过劲来。”因而决议精神不能彻底贯彻，发生偏向未能很快的发现与纠正，所以现在真正贷到群众中去的数目尚不足全县总额的一半。县生产推进社是农贷工作的主要负责机关，但它以廿三个干部去做买卖，只有五个干部负责农贷。五个人中，除信用部部长会计各一人（尚兼有其他事务）外，一个干部专门负责兑换钞票，一个干部被调到县委举办的区村干部训练班管了伙食，一个干部与实业科在观音堂搞农贷示范村。这个示范村的经验，领导上没有注意总结推广，所以成绩虽然有，但在全县说来仍是孤立的一个点。县级各部门，除实业科下乡干部稍带检查一些农贷情况外（近日有两个干部在专门检查了），始终没有较普遍或较深入的检查过一次。据记者了解，区领导工作有两种方式：一种是根据县分配的农贷数字，区主要负责干部共同讨论后，通过区代表会或村干部会分配到村，让村干部直接掌握发放，这样就发生了平均分配和分配不公的偏向。如三区共五十二个行政村，有四十七个村分到了牲畜贷粮，其中七个村每村八百斤，三十九个村每村七百五十斤，一个村三百五十斤。区里为防止村中发放的分散，曾“限定”了各村发放的户数，湾子村贷粮二千一百一十斤，区“限定”它最多贷给十六户，因为只是“限定”，没有打通思想，村干部在区登记了十六户，回村后实际上分给了四十来家。又因为分配时为少数干部掌握，不经群众公议，有些贷的很不恰当。如韩忽通在外边放着七斗玉茭的帐，又贷粮三十五斤，孔二活赌钱输了六十斤棉花，一头驴，村干部又贷给他二百五十斤牲畜贷粮。群众对这些很不满意。老坟沟四十三户人家，四十户分了贷粮，分十斤粮食的有十多户，好几户每个人只得二斤粮，闹的谁也解决不了问题。七区秋波洞头次贷粮，按人头分给了四十户。家里人口多的每人二斤，人口少的每人三斤。牲口贷粮一千斤，不经大伙商量，村长让四户有牲口的人领走了，没牲口的想贷贷不上。三区区委书记认为农贷没搞好的原因是：“没有典型示范，没有具体组织领导，也没有进行检查，区干部作了别的工作。”（驻各区的生产推进社办事处也是以供销为主。对农贷工作的领导，除主任与区委、区长共同向村分配数字外，就是专办手续），这类由于领导上的放任自流而发生上述偏向的村庄，据实业科对科长说，在三、七区是大部分。另外一种发放办法，是强调贷给组织起来的群众（县里开始是这样布置的，）组织不起来不发放。怎样进行组织起来，干部没有具体领导，六区这样工作的结果，今年分配贷粮六万五千九百二十斤，截至七月十日，只贷到户里四千三百七十余斤，广大要求贷粮的群众因为“组织”不起来，仍然贷不到手。此外，县向区分配贷粮中，分成了生产渡荒、牲畜、纺织、农具四种项目，各有具体数字，强调专款专用。四区分配牲畜贷粮一万九千二百斤，生产渡荒粮二万五千斤，结果生产渡荒粮用尽不够，牲畜贷粮发不下去。挪用需经县批准，也影响着农贷发放的迅速。贷往二区的粮食，存在一区下寨和马峪，往返一趟四十里至一百里，给二区贷粮群众增加困难不小。截至七月十日止，全县贷到各户的数目尚不足全县分配总额的二分之一。（柴夫）
