[Jinan Electric] The Li Mailing branch in the Fifth District of Yuan Dynasty correctly carries out criticism and self-criticism, transforms work style, and the branch actively leads the masses in production. This spring, during party rectification in other villages, some party members in the village were very afraid. The branch immediately actively educated and explained, so the fluctuation was not too great. Later, when the branch committee members were collectively trained, they correctly understood that the policy of party rectification was "transformation through education, treating illness to save people." After returning to the village, they convened a branch meeting, carried out criticism and self-criticism within the party based on the spirit of party rectification. After criticism and self-examination, party member Li Xinzhen consciously returned the fruits of victory he had stolen in 1945, put down his ideological burden, and participated in the mutual aid group with peace of mind. Other party members also corrected many shortcomings. Among the 30 party members in the village, 20 participated in production mutual aid groups, actively leading the masses in production, and have now become the core of unity for mass production. When leading the masses in production, the village branch began to demonstrate a new style: (1) Correcting coercive orders and learning to follow the mass line. At the beginning of the fertilizer accumulation campaign before wheat planting, the branch first studied fertilizer accumulation methods and leadership methods. At the meeting, party members came up with methods based on the reflections of the masses and took them to the farmers' association groups for discussion, soliciting opinions from the masses, and finally made a decision. In the organization of mutual aid, they overcame the past method of forced organization, allowing the masses to freely join or leave groups. In the spring, there were fourteen groups, and now sixteen groups have been formed, with group leaders democratically elected, truly achieving voluntary combination. When leading agricultural production, the branch adopted the method of first humbly learning from the masses and then educating the masses. Li Duokui's experience in planting sweet potatoes and corn in dry weather was good. The branch first learned it and used it to promote and lead the masses in the whole village. It ensures that leading agriculture means understanding field work and mastering the production season, and that leading sideline occupations means understanding market conditions. This has become an important leadership method for the village branch, coming from the masses and providing timely and specific guidance to the masses. When mobilizing for war service, the branch fully utilized democratic discussion, achieving fairness and reasonableness each time. Once, a household that was supposed to provide labor had a wedding to celebrate, and another family had a sick cow. The branch accepted the opinions of the masses and allowed them to skip this time and make up for it next time. (2) Combining general publicity with specific persuasion and mobilization. At the beginning of fertilizer accumulation this summer, it was discovered that two party members were working on manure pits. They were immediately criticized at the branch party member meeting, educating party members to lead by example. Then, at a mass meeting, the masses were mobilized to accumulate fertilizer, and unnamed criticism of the manure pit incident was also carried out, educating the masses and promoting the fertilizer accumulation campaign throughout the village. When planting and conserving for famine preparedness, party members first publicized separately, opening up the minds of the masses, and then checked and urged by street and district. Good and bad examples were discovered and praised and criticized in a timely manner. (3) Using typical examples to drive the whole village forward. After the wheat harvest, it was dry, and the masses were waiting for rain and did not dare to plant. Li Xinzhen's group created a new method of planting sweet potatoes, separating the dry soil to one side, wrapping the seedlings with wet soil, covering them with a layer of dry soil, and pouring two bowls of water, which could last for twenty days without dying. The branch used this experience to mobilize the masses in the whole village to plant 150 mu. When planting corn, the masses were also afraid that it would not sprout. The branch introduced the methods of experienced farmers to everyone. As a result, the whole village rushed to plant 450 mu. The branch always pays attention to cultivating Li Xinzhen's model group, using his group's good experience to promote the whole village. "Planning proactively according to the season" is a characteristic of the village branch's leadership in production. Now that sorghum is about to be harvested and the milling season is coming, the branch is mobilizing the masses to prepare to grind flour and raise pigs to develop sideline production.

　　树立民主作风　加强生产领导
    遇事和群众商量
  　李马陵支部领导方法好
    【冀南电】元朝五区李马陵支部，正确开展批评与自我批评，改造作风，支部积极领导群众生产。今春其他村庄整党时该村部分党员表现很害怕，支部当即积极教育解释，波动还不算大。后来集训支委，他们正确领会了整党是“改造教育，治病救人”的方针，回村后，便召开支部会，依据整党精神，开展党内批评与自我批评，经过批评检讨后，党员李新贞自觉的把一九四五年偷的胜利果实退了出来，放下思想包袱，安心参加了互助组。其他党员也改正了不少缺点。全村三十个党员中，有二十个参加了生产互助组，积极领导群众生产，现已成了团结群众的生产核心。该村支部在领导群众生产时，开始表现了新的作风：（一）纠正强迫命令，学习走群众路线。在麦前开始积肥运动时，支部首先研究积肥方法与领导方法，会上党员根据群众反映，想出办法，拿到农会小组里讨论，征求群众意见，最后作出决定。在组织互助上，克服了过去强制组织的方式，让群众自由跳组，春天十四个组，现在结成了十六个组，民主选举了组长，真正作到了自愿结合。领导农业生产时，支部采取先虚心向群众学习，然后教育群众的方法。李多奎的旱天栽红薯、种棒子的经验好，支部首先学会，用它推动与领导了全村群众。做到领导农业懂地里活，又能掌握生产季节，领导副业又懂买卖行情。这就成为该村支部来自群众又及时具体指导群众的重要领导方法。动员战勤工作时，支部充分运用了民主讨论，每次都作到公平合理。有一次该出夫的户要娶媳妇，有一家牛病了，支部接受了群众意见，让他们这次不去，下次再补上。（二）一般宣传与具体说服动员相结合。今夏积肥开始，发现两个党员干着粪坑，立即在支部党员大会上进行了批评，教育党员以身作则。然后在群众会上动员群众积肥，对干粪坑的事也进行了不提名的批评，教育了群众，推动了全村积肥运动。在点种与节约备荒时，党员先分头宣传，打通群众思想，又分街分片检查促督。发现好坏例子，及时进行表扬与批评。（三）典型示范推动全村。麦后天旱，群众等雨不敢下种。李新贞组创造了栽红薯的新办法，把干土分到一边，用湿土把秧包起来，上面盖一层干土，浇两碗水，能顶二十天不死。支部利用这个经验动员全村群众，栽了一百五十亩。种棒子时，群众也怕出不来，支部又把有经验农民的办法介绍给大家，结果全村抢种了四百五十亩。支部经常注意培养李新贞模范组，利用他组好的经验推动全村。“根据季节，主动计划”这是该村支部领导生产的特点。现在高粱将要收割，磨粉季节就到，支部便动员群众准备磨粉养猪，开展副业生产。
