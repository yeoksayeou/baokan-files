　　Record of the People of Jiaogao Governing the Water
    Yun Sheng
    Jiaogao County (newly established county, parts of Jiaoxian and Gaomi) in the Jiaodong area of Shandong Province suffered an unprecedented flood last year. In May of this year, the democratic government launched the masses to repair the rivers and manage the water, and after more than a month of efforts, it has now been successfully completed. This river management project included eleven sections of engineering on the main and tributary streams of the Dagu River, Yunliang River, Jiao River, and Xiaoxin River, including dredging, straightening bends, and building dikes to block openings, with a total length of 75.5 li. Ten districts and 448 villages participated in the project. A total of nearly 300,000 workdays were used, moving more than 610,000 cubic meters of earth. The government issued more than 430,000 jin of grain as work loans. Now the flood discharge speed of the county's main rivers has increased three times, and more than 478,000 mu of land along the rivers is free from flooding, which can increase grain production by 110 million jin per year.
    The county is a basin between Dazeshan, Laoshan, and Xiaozhushan Mountains, with rivers crisscrossing and a chaotic water system. The river channels had become increasingly silted due to years of disrepair under the Kuomintang rule, coupled with the backflow of the Yunliang River, making it difficult for the river water to flow smoothly into the sea. Starting in June of last year, it rained continuously for more than two months, resulting in a major flood. If rescue efforts had been made at that time, the disaster could have been alleviated, but at that time, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were invading Jiaodong, frantically implementing the "Three Alls" policy. Nearly 2,000 people were killed in Jiaogao County, and livestock, grain, and other property were looted, leading to an unmanageable situation. The local people were in an extremely miserable situation due to the double persecution of Chiang Kai-shek's disaster and the flood. By the time Chiang Kai-shek's bandits retreated from Jiaodong last winter, nine out of ten houses in the area were empty.
    This spring, after the East China Bureau of the CPC put forward the urgent call of "not starving a single person, not abandoning a single mu of land," the Party, government, army, and people of Jiaogao County fully organized production and mutual assistance. According to incomplete statistics, the county received more than 1.2 million jin of grain in loans, relief, and work-for-food, and 240 million yuan in North China currency, allowing the people to recover and plant most of the barren land. In order to prevent another flood this year, the county's leading organs proposed a river management campaign at the same time as spring plowing, which caused a sensation throughout the county. The peasants of Xiaoxinzhuang excitedly said: "We wanted to dig the river 30 years ago, but there was no Communist Party at that time, who would lead us! We could only stare blankly as the crops were flooded to death." When the masses in Dongliukouzi Village heard that there was work-relief grain for digging the river, they all said: "This is something we have never seen before." They enthusiastically rushed to plant crops and organized production and disaster relief committees and river construction teams, preparing various river repair materials.
    On May 1st, the various sections of the project started one after another, and thousands of people rushed to the river with various tools. Under the slogan of "men dig the river, women go down the slope (to farm)," women were widely organized to participate in weeding, and experienced old farmers were invited to lead the way, teaching and doing; the men concentrated their efforts on repairing the river.
    The Wuchi River project required digging four meters deep, and the dry ditch stones below were one and a half meters deep. Each "stone dragon" was several dozen feet long, and the river workers' hands were cracked open, bleeding. But they all maintained a daily achievement of two cubic meters of digging per person. When a new river 15 li long was completed, the people of the villages participating in the repair named the river "Crossing the Famine River" to commemorate their hardships.
    While the people were working hard to repair the river, they were constantly subjected to the crazy sabotage of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. On the third day after the start of construction in Liujiadong Village in the Jiolai District, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits east of the river sent more than 50 people to kill three village cadres, including the village chief and the agricultural association chairman. But the next day, the people of the entire village held a meeting and decided to strengthen sentry duty and continue to repair the river with armed protection. On May 18th, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits sent more than 20 people to Yunliang River to capture river workers and sabotage the project. The river workers rose up to resist and drove the bandits back. Then, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits repeatedly sent troops and armored vehicles to harass them, and US-made Chiang Kai-shek's planes also came to bomb and strafe them from time to time. But the people finally overcame all these disturbances and completed the great project with their blood and sweat.

　　记胶高人民治水
    云生
    山东胶东区的胶高县（新设县，胶县、高密各一部），去年曾遭受数十年来未有的大水灾。今年五月，民主政府即发起群众修河治水，经一月余的努力，现已胜利完成。此次治河包括大沽河、运粮河、胶河、小新河等干支流的开渠、疏浚、裁弯取直、筑堤堵口等十一段工程，全长七十五点五里。参加工程的有十个区，四四八个村。共用工近三十万个，使土六十一万多方。政府发放工贷粮四十三万余斤。现全县干河泄水速度增加三倍，沿河四十七万八千余亩土地免去水灾，每年可多收粮食一亿一千万斤。
    该县是大泽山、崂山、小珠山之间的一块盆地，河流纵横交叉，水系紊乱。各河道因在国民党统治下年久失修，日渐淤塞，加以运粮河倒灌，因此河水常难畅流入海。去年六月开始，阴雨连绵两个多月，于是造成大水灾。当时如能全力抢救，灾情本可减轻，但当时正值蒋匪进犯胶东，疯狂实行“三光”政策，胶高全县被杀者近两千人，牲口、粮食及其他财产，均被洗劫一空，以致酿成无法收拾的局面。当地人民在蒋灾、水灾的双重迫害下，陷入了极悲惨的境地。至去冬蒋匪由胶东败退时，当地已十室九空。
    今春，中共华东局提出“不饿死一个人，不荒掉一亩地”的紧急号召后，胶高党、政、军、民即全力组织生产及互救自救。据不完全统计，全县得贷款、救济及以工代赈粮共一百二十余万斤，北币二万万四千万元，人民得以苏息，并种上大部荒地。为预防今年再遭水祸，县的领导机关在春耕同时，即提出治河号召，一时全县为之轰动。小新庄的农民兴奋的说：“我们早在三十年前就想挖河了，可是那时没有共产党，谁来领导！庄稼涝死了也只有干瞪眼。”东流口子村的群众听到挖河还有工赈粮，都说：“这可是从没见过的事情。”他们热烈地一面抢种，一面组织生产救灾委员会及河工队，准备了各种修河嚣材。
    五月一日，各段工程相继开工，成千成万的人们带着各种工具，奔赴河上。在“男人挖河女人下坡（种地）”的口号下，妇女普遍组织起来，参加锄苗，请有经验的老农带头，边教边做；男人们就集中力量修河。
    五尺河的工程要挖四公尺深，下边的干沟石就有一公尺半深，一条条的“石龙”都有几丈长，河工们手上震开了口子，流着鲜血。但他们都始终保持了每人每天挖两土方的成绩。当一条十五里长的新河完成时，参加修治的各村人民给这条河起名为“渡荒河”，以纪念他们的艰辛。
    在人民全力修河时，他们仍不断遭到蒋匪军疯狂的破坏。胶莱区刘家懂村开工后第三天，河东的蒋匪即派出五十余人杀了村长、农会长等三名村干部。可是第二天全村人民就召开大会，决定加强站岗放哨，以武装保护继续开工修河。五月十八日蒋匪派出二十余人，窜到运粮河捕捉河工，破坏工程，河工群起抵抗，把匪徒们打退。接着蒋匪又连续出动部队、铁甲车进扰，美制蒋机也时来轰炸扫射。但人民终于战胜了这一切扰害，以他们的血汗完成了浩大的全部工程。
