　　With the establishment of democratic government in the newly liberated cities of Fenyang, Jiaocheng, and Qingyuan in Jinzhong, industry and commerce are rapidly recovering. All of the more than 400 industrial and commercial businesses in Fenyang have now resumed operations, and residents highly praise the democratic government's policy of protecting industry and commerce. One businessman said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, industry and commerce will surely flourish." The Yi Yongquan Fenjiu Distillery, located thirty li east of the city and famous throughout North China, suffered several raids by Yan's troops, and most of its distilling equipment was destroyed or moved elsewhere. It had been closed for a long time, but with loans and practical assistance from the democratic government, it is actively preparing to resume production. On the day of Jiaocheng's liberation, merchants saw that the People's Liberation Army did not enter private shops or residences and maintained strict discipline, so all shops and stalls immediately opened their doors and resumed business as usual. A certain silk shop on Beicang Street had an income of 3 million in local currency that day. The Dongguan market, which had been stagnant for many years, has been restored. Before the war, Qingyuan City had more than 400 industrial and commercial businesses, which were reduced to 120 during the Japanese occupation. Later, they were devastated by dozens of harsh and complex burdens imposed by Yan's troops and the "integration of soldiers and merchants" corvée. Before liberation, only about 50 businesses remained, and under the extreme monopoly of Yan's bureaucratic capital and the restrictions of the "three certificates" (National Identity Card, Soldier-Peasant-Merchant Association Certificate, and Road Pass), freedom of trade was completely deprived, leaving them barely able to survive. After the democratic government entered the city, it first announced the abolition of all Yan's harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies and various systems that restricted the development of industry and commerce, and advocated free trade. In order to alleviate the special difficulties faced by industrialists and merchants due to the extreme devastation caused by Yan's troops, the democratic government also announced a one-year exemption from business tax to help industry and commerce recover quickly. The democratic government also introduced and assisted merchants in transporting large quantities of necessities such as oil, hemp, alkali, and matches from the old liberated areas, and assisted in the restoration of canned food industries such as raisin and wine production. Now, all of the more than 50 shops have resumed business, and those that have been closed for many years are also decorating their storefronts in preparation for resuming operations. On the fourth day after the liberation of the city, the number of people attending the market exceeded more than twice the number during Yan's rule.

　　消除阎匪苛政提倡自由贸易
  　晋中新区工商复业
    【新华社晋绥七日电】晋中新解放之汾阳、交城、清源等城工商业在民主政权建立后，正在迅速恢复。汾阳四百余家工商业现已全部恢复，居民对民主政府保护工商业政策极为称赞。一位商人说：“共产党领导下的国家，工商业一定茂盛。”该城城东三十里驰名华北的义涌泉汾酒制造厂，遭受阎匪数次抢掠，蒸酒器具大部被毁或搬走他地，停业日久，现经民主政府予以贷款及实际帮助，正积极筹备开工。交城解放当天，商人看到解放军不进私人商店民宅，纪律严明，全部商铺摊贩马上开门照常营业。北苍街某绸缎庄，当天收入达本币三百万元。停顿多年的东关集市已重新恢复。清源城战前有工商业四百余家，日寇占领时减为一百二十家，后经阎匪数十种苛杂繁重负担及“兵商合一”的差役摧残，在解放前仅剩五十余家，且在阎匪官僚资本极端垄断和“三证”（国民身份证、兵农商会证、路证）的束缚下贸易自由被剥夺殆尽，仅能苟延残喘，朝不保夕。民主政府进城后，首先宣布废除阎匪一切苛捐杂税及束缚工商业发展的各种制度，提倡自由贸易。为解除工商业者因受阎匪极度摧残所形成的特殊困难，民主政府并宣布免缴营业税一年，帮助工商业迅速恢复。民主政府又介绍和协助商贩到老解放区贩运大批油、麻、硷、火柴等必需品，协助恢复葡萄干、葡萄酒等罐头工业。现五十余家商店已全部恢复营业，关闭多年者亦纷纷装饰门面，准备复业。该城解放后的第四天，赶集群众超过阎匪统治时期一倍以上。
