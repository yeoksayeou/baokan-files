Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, New York - The American housewives' boycott movement against rising prices is developing in many states. Housewives are holding demonstrations and setting up picket lines to boycott meat stores. In Los Angeles, due to the increasing public resistance to high meat prices, 25 local meat stores have been forced to close. In San Francisco, meat sales have decreased by 25 percent due to the housewives' boycott. In New York, meat sales have also decreased as women's groups strengthen mass picketing and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) supports the anti-high price movement. Moyer, the publisher of the Washington Post, admitted in his dispatch from Chicago that consumer boycotts can affect meat prices.

  　罢购运动在发展中
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：抗议物价上涨的美国家庭主妇罢购运动正在许多州发展着。主妇们举行示威，布置纠察线来抵制肉食商店。在洛杉机，由于群众对高昂肉价的抵制日增，当地二十五家肉食店已被迫关门。在旧金山，由于主妇们的抵制，肉食销售减少了百分之廿五。在纽约，在妇女团体加强群众的纠察工作和产联所支持的反高物价运动下，肉食销售亦已减少。华盛顿邮报发行人莫耶尔在其芝加哥来讯中，承认消费者的抵制能够影响肉类的价格。
