Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. TASS reports: New democratic countries such as Czechoslovakia and Poland have recently summarized their industrial production achievements for the first half of this year, showing that they have all successfully completed and exceeded their plans.

    Czechoslovakian industry has exceeded the June plan by 2.9 percent, the six-month plan by 2.1 percent, and the pre-war level by 5 percent. Among them, the glass industry performed the best, exceeding the six-month plan by 23.8 percent, the steel industry by 9.6 percent, and the chemical industry by 9.2 percent. The people of the whole country are striving to complete the two-year plan by October 28th this year, the 30th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's declaration of independence.

    All major industries in Poland have exceeded their plans. In the first half of the year, coal production reached 33.4 million tons, exceeding the plan by 4 percent; milled iron was 548,800 tons, exceeding the plan by 9 percent; coking coal was 2,264,000 tons, exceeding the plan by 9 percent; oil was 67,300 tons, exceeding the plan by 7 percent; and electricity was 1.978 billion kilowatts, exceeding the plan by 6 percent. Among them, coal production exceeded nearly double the pre-war level, and iron production exceeded 57 percent of the pre-war level.

    In Romania, since the promulgation of the nationalization decree on large industries, banks, transportation, and all natural resources on the 11th of last month, the largest industry in Romania – the oil industry, which was previously exclusively capitalized by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France – has overcome the work slowdown created by foreign capitalists in the past. The output of all oil fields has greatly exceeded the June plan. Nationalization has greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of workers, and labor productivity and labor discipline have been strengthened. The gold, silver, zinc, aluminum, and iron mining industries have all exceeded their plans. Nationalization has also enabled Romania to formulate economic plans that had never existed in the past. The Presidium of the National Assembly issued an order at the beginning of the month to establish a government planning commission to carry out the work of formulating plans.

    Hungary's metal industry has exceeded the pre-war level by 37 percent, and the machine manufacturing industry has also exceeded it by 12 percent.

    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社讯：捷克、波兰等新民主国家最近总结今年上半年工业生产成绩，显示均已胜利完成并超过计划。
    捷克工业已超过六月份计划百分之二点九，超过六个月计划百分之二点一，超过战前水平百分之五。其中成绩最佳的玻璃工业超过六个月计划百分之二三点八，钢铁工业超过百分之九点六，化学工业超过百分之九点二。全国人民正为争取在今年十月二十八日捷克宣布独立三十周年纪念日完成二年计划而努力。
    波兰各主要工业均超过计划。上半年煤产量达三千三百四十万吨，超过计划百分之四；铣铁五十四万八千八百吨，超过计划百分之九；焦煤二百二十六万四千吨，超过计划百分之九；石油六万七千三百吨，超过计划百分之七；电力十九亿七千八百万千瓦，超过计划百分之六。其中煤产超过战前几及一倍，铁产超过战前百分之五十七。
    罗马尼亚自上月十一日颁布大工业、银行、运输与一切自然资源国有化法令后，过去为英美法三国独占资本所有的罗国最大工业——石油工业，已克服过去外国资本家制造的怠工现象，所有油田的产量都大大超过六月份计划。国有化大大激励了工人的劳动热情，劳动生产率与劳动纪律均已加强，金、银、锌、铝、铁各采矿业都超过计划。国有化并使罗国得以制订过去从未有过的经济计划，国民议会主席团已于月初下令成立政府计划委员会，进行制订计划工作。
    匈牙利金属工业已超过战前水平百分之三十七，机器制造业亦超过百分之十二。
