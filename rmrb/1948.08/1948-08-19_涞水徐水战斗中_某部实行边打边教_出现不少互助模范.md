[Pingbao Frontline News] In the two battles of Bei'yian in Laishui and Xushui City, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army generally ensured that veteran soldiers provided on-the-job training, comfort, and encouragement to new soldiers. The heroic and exemplary actions of the veteran soldiers inspired the fighting spirit of the new soldiers, improved their tactics, and helped them complete combat missions. Before the battle, each company of the unit conducted in-depth deliberations, emphasizing the wartime mutual aid role of mutual aid groups. Some veteran comrades signed "mutual aid contracts" with new comrades, while others made leading new comrades in battle a key condition for earning merit. Luo Zhilin's group in the 4th Company used grievance sessions to inspire the new soldiers' vengeful emotions. At the soldiers' meeting of the 7th Company, it was proposed that "veteran comrades should be brave and resourceful, leading new soldiers to complete tasks and earn merit," and "new comrades should not panic on the battlefield, veteran soldiers are role models." This reduced the new comrades' concerns about "not knowing how to fight." Due to the in-depth ideological deliberations and preparations before the battle, many mutual aid models emerged during the fighting. For example, when enemy planes strafed, veteran soldier Luo Zhilin hid two new comrades, telling them to advance when the opportunity arose. When crossing the enemy's fire blockade line, Luo Zhilin first went over to select the terrain, and then let the new comrades cross to dig fortifications south of the city. With intense enemy fire and enemy planes buzzing around, new soldier Zhang Weiwen didn't know how to dig. Luo Zhilin taught him to first dig a single-person shelter on the wall, hide himself, and then dig a trench. Zhang Sanfa, a veteran soldier in the 6th Company, told new comrades not to be timid in battle. During the assault, he first dug fortifications for the new comrades, told them to hide well, and then dug his own. When Yan Zhenhai saw that half of new soldier Sun Huai's body was exposed, he immediately told him to lie down. Yan Zhenhai, a veteran soldier from the 4th Company, and Li Pianyuan, a new soldier, were a demolition team. He first showed Li how to do it, then told him not to take the same route back as he had come, to avoid the enemy's blockade. During the battle, some new soldiers were afraid of airplanes, and veteran soldiers explained, "Airplanes can't win the battle. When we look down from the mountains, it's still blurry, let alone airplanes!" Some new comrades were afraid of artillery shells, and veteran soldiers explained, "Artillery shells won't hit the trenches so accurately." Some were afraid of bullets, and veteran soldiers said, "When we practice shooting, we aim for a long time and still aren't completely accurate! Let alone from so far away." Veteran artillery shooter Wen Xinfang first set the distance and angle for new artillerymen Ma Wenru and others, and as a result, two out of three shots hit the target. The new comrades all gained confidence. New soldier Liu Fulai followed the veteran comrades closely and wasn't timid at all.

　　涞水徐水战斗中
  　某部实行边打边教
  　出现不少互助模范
    【平保前线讯】解放军某部在涞水北义安及徐水城两次战斗中，老战士对新战士，比较普遍的做到了边打边教，边安慰边鼓励等工作，以老战士的英勇模范行动激励了新战士的战斗情绪，提高了新战士的战术，完成战斗任务。该部各连队战前深入酝酿，强调互助小组的战时互助作用。有的老同志向新同志订立了“互助合同”，有的将带领新同志作战，订为立功条件的主要一项。某部四连罗志林小组并用诉苦方式，启发新战士的复仇情绪。某部七连士兵大会上，则提出“老同志要英勇机智，带领新战士完成任务立功。”“新同志要到战场上不慌，老战士是榜样。”新同志因此减去了“不会打仗”的顾虑，由于战前经过深入的思想酝酿与准备，战斗中出现不少互助模范。如老战士罗志林当敌机扫射时，把两个新同志隐蔽起来，叫他们待机前进。当通过敌火封锁线时，罗志林先过去选好地形，再让新同志过南城挖工事。敌火打的紧，敌机又闹，新战士张未文不会挖，罗志林教给他先在墙上挖个单人掩体，隐住身子再挖沟。某部六连老战士张三法，嘱咐新同志打仗别胆小，冲锋时他先给新同志挖好工事，叫他们隐蔽好，自己再挖。阎振海见新战士孙怀暴露着半截身子，立即告诉他卧倒。四连老战士阎振海和新战士李偏元是一个爆破组，他先一个人做样子叫李看着，又告诉他回来不要走去时的路，躲开敌人的封锁。战斗中新战士有的怕飞机，老战士给解释道：“飞机解决不了战斗，咱们在山上往下看，还很模糊，何况飞机呢！”有的新同志怕炮弹，老战士给解释道：“炮弹不会那么巧就打到沟里。”有的怕子弹，老战士说：“打靶时瞄半天还不完全准呢！何况这么远。”炮兵老射手文新方同志，先给新炮手马文如等订好距离、角度，结果三发二中。新同志都有了信心。新战士刘福来紧跟着老同志，一点也不胆小了。　　（杜锋、赵珍、李明田）
