　　【Taihang Telegram】In the past twenty days, our local armed forces in Jiaozuo have been actively launching attacks in coordination with political offensives, disintegrating and killing 149 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The political offensive has been particularly effective. Since the upsurge of the political offensive in early June, we have deeply penetrated Chiang Kai-shek's occupied areas and held various propaganda meetings, extensively publicizing our policies. The working teams of the Third District deeply penetrated more than 20 villages and strongholds in Chiang Kai-shek's occupied areas, posting various propaganda materials on the streets. In 20 days, they won over 75 enemy and diehards, disintegrated one puppet company, and caused it to fall apart. The county first conducted policy study and education among the working teams, enabling everyone to recognize the current favorable situation, eliminate ideological obstacles, and discuss ways to win over the puppet troops. They loudly put forward the slogan "Disintegrating one enemy is equivalent to killing one enemy," "Everyone should disintegrate and strive for meritorious service," establishing everyone's belief and consciousness in carrying out political offensives. At the same time, they mobilized the families of puppet soldiers to speak out about their sufferings and make comparisons, recognize the future, and mobilize them to send letters and messages to their sons and husbands. In the Third District, eleven old ladies personally went to Chiang Kai-shek's area to call out to their sons. One old lady persuaded her son, saying, "You don't care about your old mother. Last year, not even one mu of land was planted. If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army's relief, providing grain and loans to help me produce, your mother would have starved to death long ago." Some mothers educated their sons, saying, "You are doing unconscionable things outside, leaving me with no one to produce. I am being cursed everywhere." At the same time, they expanded the persuasion campaign by having relatives call relatives and friends persuade friends. Some said: It is more glorious to run back sooner than to be captured in the future. This approach has been very effective. After in-depth investigation and research, they seized on the difficulties and pain of the enemy and puppets to conduct psychological warfare. At the same time, they educated wavering soldiers to collude and pointed out the way forward for them, explaining that as long as they turned back and stopped doing it, those who had made mistakes could atone for their crimes by performing meritorious service, guaranteeing that nothing would happen. Under the internal and external attack, one enemy company of 16 people, including three squad leaders, all broke up and quit on July 6.

　　【Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram】From July 1st to the end of the month, the "Deserter Chiang Army Reception Centers" in various counties of the First Special District (excluding Pingyin) have accommodated a total of 3,173 deserter Chiang soldiers (including more than 300 defeated soldiers and prisoners of war), and brought with them two machine guns, nine rifles, and 1,500 rounds of ammunition.

　　焦作我军深入政攻
  　蒋伪军纷纷散伙
    【太行电】焦作我地方武装近二十天来以主动出击配合政治攻势，瓦解与毙伤蒋匪一百四十九名。其中特别收效的是政治攻势，当政攻热潮于上月初旬掀起后，我曾深入蒋占区召开了各种宣传会，深入的宣传了我们的政策。三区武工队深入蒋占区二十多个村庄据点，在街上贴了各种宣传品，在二十天中共争取敌顽七十五名，瓦解一个伪中队散了伙，该县首先在武工队中进行了政策学习和教育，使大家认识目前有利形势，扫除思想障碍，并讨论了争取伪军的办法，响亮提出“瓦解一个敌人等于打死一个敌人。”“人人瓦解争取立功”的口号，确立了大家开展政攻的信念与自觉性。同时发动伪属诉苦对比，认识前途，发动伪属捎书传信叫子叫夫，三区有十一个老太太亲自至蒋区叫他儿子，一个老太太劝他儿说：“你就不管你的老娘，去年一亩地也没种上，不是八路军救济，贷粮贷款让我生产，早把你娘饿死了。”有的母亲教育他儿说：“你在外干那没良心的事，丢下我没人生产，到处落人骂。”同时以亲戚叫亲戚朋友劝朋友扩大规劝运动，有的说：你早些跑回来比将来捉回来光荣。这种作法收效很大。经过深入调查研究，抓住敌伪困难和痛苦进行攻心战，同时教育动摇的士兵进行串通，并为其指出前途。说明只要他们回头不干，有错的立功赎罪，保险没事。在里外夹攻下，敌人有个中队十六人，内有三个班长在七月六日齐散伙不干。
    【冀鲁豫电】一专区各县（平阴未统计在内）“逃亡蒋军招待所”自“七一”到月底共收容逃亡蒋军三一七三名（内有三百多溃兵及俘虏）。并携来机枪两挺，步枪九支，子弹一五零零发。
