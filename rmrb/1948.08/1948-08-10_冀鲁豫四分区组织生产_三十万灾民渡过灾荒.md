    [Jilu Yu Dispatch] The 300,000 disaster-stricken people in the Fourth Military Sub-district of Jilu Yu, with the help of government loans and grain relief, have actively engaged in production for self-salvation and have overcome the severe famine. Due to the drought in the autumn of last year and the continuous looting and destruction by the Chiang bandits, the masses in various counties of the sub-district suffered heavy losses, resulting in a severe spring famine this year. In April, in the seven heavily affected villages of Tielu, Wanglugangdian, Getai, and Xiaoqingguan in Changyuan, and Liuxiaozhai, Temple, and Xiezhai in Huaxian, 251 households had nothing to eat immediately, and 266 households could not survive until the wheat harvest, accounting for 50.43% of the total number of households. Even in lightly affected villages with relatively good autumn harvests, such as a village with 56 households in the third district of Huaxian, 22 households did not have enough to eat in February. According to statistics from the entire sub-district in early April, there were approximately 300,000 famine-stricken people, most of whom lived by eating wild vegetables and tree leaves, making spring plowing very difficult. At that time, the democratic government, on the one hand, called on the masses to help each other, and on the other hand, issued loans of 520.5 million yuan, and provided relief of 490,000 jin of rice and 180,000 jin of bean flour to support disaster-stricken people in spring plowing and the development of sideline production. After receiving loans and grain relief, the enthusiasm of the disaster-stricken people for production greatly increased. In particular, women's weaving quickly became popular. According to statistics from the five market towns of Jingdian, Jiuji, Liangzhuang, Baidaokou, and Zhaoying, each market could originally collect 960 bolts of cloth, but after the loans and grain relief to the disaster-stricken people, it could collect 2,360 bolts of cloth. From April 10th to May 10th, in one month, the entire sub-district collected a total of 68,816 bolts of cloth, and the weaving women earned a total of 11,265 shi of grain. The government and state-owned stores organized disaster-stricken people to transport 2.92 million jin of public grain and store grain, providing work as a form of relief, and the disaster-stricken people received 2,138 shi and 6 dou of grain. Under the government's assistance, the masses also developed other various sideline industries, such as more than 20 households in Xinzhuang in the fourth district of Gaoling, who produced 3,000 jin of caustic soda. In Caiying Village in the fourth district of Huaxian, out of more than 200 households in the entire village, more than 180 households boiled salt, using sideline income to overcome the famine.

    冀鲁豫四分区组织生产
    三十万灾民渡过灾荒
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫四分区三十万灾民，在政府的贷款及粮食救济下积极生产自救，已渡过严重灾荒。该分区各县因去秋天旱歉收及蒋匪不断的抢掠破坏，群众损失甚重，造成今年严重的春荒。四月份长垣的铁炉、王芦岗店、葛台、小青观，滑县的刘小砦、寺庙、谢砦等七个重灾村，有二百五十一户当下就没吃的，维持不到麦收的有二百六十六户，以上合占总户数的百分之五十点四三。就是秋收较好的轻灾村，如滑县三区有个五十六户的村子，在二月间，不够吃的也有二十二户。根据四月初全分区的统计，缺粮灾民约有三十万，大部靠吃野菜树叶为生，春耕非常困难。民主政府当时一面号召群众互济互救，一面发放贷款五万万二千零五十万元，救济米四十九万斤，豆粉十八万斤，支持灾民春耕，发展副业生产。灾民获得贷款及粮食救济后，生产情绪大为提高。特别是妇女纺织迅即普遍开展。据井店、九棘、梁庄、白道口、赵营五个集镇的统计，原来每集共可收布九百六十匹，经贷款及粮食救济灾民后，能收布二千三百六十匹。从四月十日到五月十日一个月中，全分区。共收布六万千八百一十六匹，纺妇共赚粮一万一千二百六十五石。政府及公营商店组织灾民运输公粮及商店粮食二百九十二万斤，以工代赈，灾民得粮二千一百三十八石六斗。群众在政府扶助下还开展了其他各种副业，如高陵四区辛庄二十多户，烧碱三千斤。滑县四区蔡营村全村二百多户，有一百八十多户熬盐，用副业收入渡过灾荒。
