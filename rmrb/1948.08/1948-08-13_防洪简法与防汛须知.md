    Flood Control Tools and Methods

    Based on the principle of using local materials, various regions can choose and apply methods according to their specific circumstances.

    (1) Grass Bundles: Their role is to prevent the riverbank from collapsing due to water erosion. Grass bundles are made by using willow branches (or sorghum stalk bundles with a diameter of half a foot) as the outer layer, and wrapping heavier materials such as bricks, stones, or clay inside. Their size is generally three to four feet in diameter and about three zhang in length (approximately 10 meters). They can be bundled on the spot. For ease of bundling, it is best to drive several intersecting diagonal stakes at the predetermined location, lay half of the willow branches on the stakes, then fill with stones to half the height. At the tail end of the grass bundle, set up a "horseback" (a horseback is an X-shape formed by two pieces of wood), secure the horseback with walnut rope (hemp rope as thick as a walnut), pass the rope through the center of the grass bundle, and lead it out from the head end (called a "center string"). Then fill with stones to the required height, cover with willow branches, and tightly bind the outside every foot or so with walnut rope. Tie the end of the rope (the center string) to a root stake (a small stake on the bank or levee top). The head end of the grass bundle must be close to the riverbank, and the tail end should be one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) away from the riverbank. The distance between grass bundles should not be too large; the distance between the head end of the second grass bundle and the tail end of the first grass bundle should be about one zhang.

    (2) Permeable Spur Dikes: When the river surface is very wide, permeable spur dikes can be used to prevent the water flow from approaching the bank and eroding the riverbank. The spur dikes can also allow floodwaters to spread and deposit silt, which is beneficial for the safety of the riverbank. These spur dikes must be made in large numbers; too few will not be effective, and they should not be placed in the main current.

    The construction method of the dike: Start from the riverbank and drive piles perpendicular to the direction of the water flow. The piles should be five to eight inches in diameter, and the length of the piles should be determined according to the specific situation. The depth of the piles driven into the soil should be at least equal to the water depth, and the top of the piles should be about one foot above the water surface (for example, if the water depth is five feet, the pile should be one zhang and one foot). The spacing between piles should be two to three feet, and the interval between rows of piles should be three to six feet. After the piles are driven, use the row of piles as the center and dig a trench three feet deep in the ground. Then weave willow bundles (or reed stalk bundles, etc.) with a diameter of half a foot onto the piles and press them tightly, and connect the willow bundles to the piles with 16-gauge wire or hemp rope. Proceed in this way until the top of the pile. After the work is completed, the soil trough should be filled and compacted. The distance between dikes should be about twice the length of one dike (for example, if the length of the first dike is fifteen zhang, the second dike can be made thirty zhang downstream from the first dike).

    (3) Straw Anchors: When floodwaters overflow the river滩 (sandbar) and erode the sand levee, this method can be used to protect the levee. This method was effective in Beilonggang, Xingtang, but it loses its effectiveness when the main current is close to the sand levee.

    The method is to construct on the levee slope (starting from the levee root) in the direction of the water flow, but at a slight angle to it. Dig a small ditch and place bundles of rice straw in the ditch. On the side of this bundle of straw, use another bundle of straw to press down in the direction of the water flow, and bury the lower part with soil and sand. When water overflows the straw, it can generate a comb-like flow, and the sand at the levee toe will not be washed away.

    (4) Earth Bundles: Earth bundles are quadrilateral earth mounds that are small at the top and large at the bottom. When floodwaters overflow the top of the levee, the levee body is very likely to breach, which is called overflow breaching. Earth bundles are used to prevent overflow breaching. Set up an earth bundle on the levee top at regular intervals. Once the floodwater continues to rise and there is a tendency to overflow the top, the earth bundles can be used to temporarily make a smaller cross-section 子捻 (small levee) on the levee top to avoid floodwaters overflowing and causing disaster.

    Flood Prevention Guidelines

    (1) Those responsible for flood prevention work should first conduct a detailed on-site observation to understand the width, height, and quality of the levee body, the distance from the river, the height of the river灘 (sandbar) lip, the overall terrain and changes in water flow, and the preparation of materials, to prepare in advance; so as not to panic when the water rises or a danger is reported.

    (2) Levee Construction: No soil is allowed to be dug at the toe of the levee. When adding soil, it must be compacted in batches (relatively thin layers) with a tamper, wooden rammer, or stone hammer. The levee slope should be gentle (at least a slope of 1:1); it should be even more gentle at the river-facing side.

    Cutting grass on the levee top and levee slope is not allowed, as the grass roots can protect the levee. Livestock and heavy vehicles are not allowed to pass on the levee.

    (3) Inspection: Levee slopes often have badger burrows and rat holes, which are small on the outside and large on the inside, and are most easily overlooked. Careful inspection should be made. If found, they should be dug open, filled, and compacted. After prolonged rain or heavy rain, there must be high waves (mostly at the toe of the levee) and flow gullies, which should be repaired quickly.

    (4) Overflow: When the river water rises sharply, after filling the channel and continuing to rise, it will overflow. A 子捻 (small levee) should be quickly built, two to three feet high and one zhang wide (built on the water-facing side). In short, the aim is to block the river water and prevent it from overflowing. However, if the 子捻 (small levee) is made purely of loose soil, wet mud, or has a lot of sand, it is even more difficult to consolidate. More mat sheets should be prepared to wrap the 子捻 (small levee) to resist the water.

    (5) Danger: River bends where the current directly impacts the levee are most prone to danger. In these areas, the levee body must be raised and thickened. Material rolls should be prepared in advance, and large 由子 (water pillows) should be hung to suppress the current. Or make downstream screens. If it is too urgent to wait, immediately hang willow branches and press bricks, and insert them to the bottom to divert the flow and trap silt, temporarily relieving the immediate crisis.

    (6) Rescue: When the floodwaters reach the levee toe, it is necessary to patrol day and night to check for seepage. If the inner slope shows signs of dampness, it is necessary to pay attention at all times. The water seeping out from the outer levee must be clear. If muddy water flows out, urgent measures should be taken to prevent leakage. The methods are: 1. Waist Leak: For waist leaks, wheat straw should be prepared. Dig from the levee top to the leak, lay a layer of straw, add a layer of soil, and trample it with many people, laying and building layer by layer, and then add麻袋 (gunny sacks) (filled with soil). Also, prepare multiple cotton quilts to plug the leak until no more muddy water is seen. 2. Bottom Leak: If it is a bottom leak, it is more dangerous, but do not panic. First, observe the situation. If there is a vortex, it is the entry point of the water. Immediately send people to go into the water to feel around and use pots, cotton quilts, or麻袋 (gunny sacks) (half-filled with soil) to plug it according to its shape. Dump soil around it to block the flow. If no water entry is seen, then build a moon-shaped levee on the inner slope, leaving a ditch in the soil on both sides for water to flow out. After the moon-shaped levee is higher than the outer 灘 (sandbar) water surface, then backfill with soil, which is more stable. 3. If rescue is not possible and the levee bank is about to breach, do not panic, because the breach at this time is only a few zhang. Quickly set up pillows outside the breach (the section of the levee that has been breached), raising them one or two feet above the outer 灘 (sandbar) water surface to ease the water flow. At the same time, mobilize shovel workers to stand in a row at the levee head and shovel the soil into it. Many people should also stand arm in arm in the breach, close their eyes, and stomp with all their might to make the soil dense and block the breach.

    If the levee cannot be defended and finally breaches, take emergency measures at the inner head (the end of the breached levee) to prevent it from widening, and at the same time, calculate the materials needed and plan to block the breach.

    防洪用具及办法
    以就地取材为原则，各地可按具体情况选择施用。
    （一）草牛：其作用在于防止河岸受水流冲刷而坍塌的危险。草牛是用柳枝（或直径半尺的秫楷把子）作外皮，把砖石或黏土等比较重大的材料裹在里面作成的，其大小一般是直径三、四尺，长约三丈。可在就地捆做，为了捆做便利，最好在预定的位置打几个交叉式的斜桩，在桩上铺一半柳枝，然后在上面填石，填到一半高度时，在草牛尾端设骑马（骑马是两根木料札成的×形），骑马用核桃绳（象核桃粗细的麻绳）拴住，把绳通过草牛中心，由首端引出（叫做串心绳），然后填石到所需的高度，上面用柳枝铺好，外面每隔一尺左右用核桃绳勒紧捆札，把绳头（串心绳）拴在根桩（岸边或堤顶上的小桩）上。草牛首端须紧靠河岸，尾端与河岸垂距一丈，草牛的距离不能太大，第二个草牛首端与第一个草牛尾端距离约为一丈即可。
    （二）透水丁坝：河面甚宽时，可用透水丁坝，防止水流逼近岸根，冲坍河岸。丁坝之间还能漫洪落淤，有利於河岸的安全，这种丁坝必须多做，太少了不生效力；而且不能做在正流的地方。
    坝的作法：由河岸起依水流垂直的方向打，桩粗直径五寸至八寸，桩长按具体情况确定，打桩入土长度至少应与水深相等，桩顶高出水面一尺左右（例如水深五尺，则桩须一丈一尺）桩距二尺至三尺，排桩间隔三尺至六尺。桩打好后，以排桩为中心，在地面挖槽三尺深，然后将直径半尺的柳把（或苇秫秸把等）编在桩上压紧，用十六号铅丝或麻绳将柳把连结在桩上。这样依次进行，一直编至桩顶。工作完成以后，应把土槽填平夯宽。坝与坝的距离约为一坝长的二倍（例如第一道坝长十五丈，第二坝可在第一道坝以下三十丈处作）。
    （三）压须：当洪水漫上河滩，冲蚀沙堤时，可用此法护堤。此法在行唐北龙岗实施有效，但在正流靠近沙堤时，此法就失去效力。
    作法是在堤坡上（由堤根开始）顺水流方向修筑，但与之略成斜角。挖一小沟，沟内放入成束的稻草，在这束稻草上侧，另用稻草依水流方向压上，下部用土砂埋住。水漫过稻草时，可生栉流作用，堤脚之砂就不致被冲走。
    （四）土牛：土牛是四边形上小下大的土堆。洪水漫过堤顶，堤身极易招致决口，这叫做漫决，土牛就是预防漫决的。在堤顶上每隔一定距离设置一土牛，一旦洪水续涨不已，有漫顶趋势时，就可利用土牛，在堤顶临时做成断面较小的子捻，避免洪水漫溢成灾。

    防汛须知
    （一）负责防汛工作者，首先应详细实地观察，了解堤身宽容、高低，土头好坏。离河远近，滩唇高矮，全段工势及水势变迁，材料准备情况，预为准备；以免等待水涨、报险才慌张失措。
    （二）堤工：在堤的坡脚地点，分毫不准挖土。加土得用硪、木夯或石锤分批（较薄）夯实，堤坡宜坦（最少是一比一的坡度）；临河处更须平坦。
    堤顶、堤坡不准刈草，草根可以护堤。不准牲畜及载重车辆在堤上通行。
    （三）检查：堤坡常有獾洞、鼠穴，口小里大，最易忽略，应细心踏看。发现了应即挖开填实加夯。久雨或大雨后，必有浪高（多在堤坡脚）、流沟，应速加修补。
    （四）漫溢：河水骤涨，满槽后再涨即将漫溢，应速挑筑子埝，高二三尺，宽一丈（临水一面挑筑）。总之使能挡住河水，不至漫溢为要，但子埝如纯系浮土，又是湿泥，沙质又多时更不易筑固。应多备席片，包挂子埝方可御水。
    （五）出险：河流顶冲座湾，直逼最易出险，在这些地方，堤身必须加高培厚。并应预先准备料卷，将大由子（即水枕）挂好，以压流头。或做顺水埽。如急不可待，即挂柳压砖，追插到底，可回流挂淤，暂救眉急。
    （六）抢险：漫滩水到堤根，必需日夜巡查有无渗漏，如里坡一见潮润，即须时刻留心，堤外浸出之水其色必清，若是浑水流出，应赶急防漏。方法为：１、腰漏：腰漏应预备麦秸，由堤顶挖至漏处，即铺一层草，加上一层土，用多人践踏，逐层铺筑，再加麻袋（盛满土）。另外预备棉被多床塞漏，以不见浑水为止。２、底漏：如系底漏，较为危险，但切勿手忙脚乱。先察出形势，见有漩涡即是进水之门，应即速令人下水踹摸，用锅、棉被或麻袋（装土一半），随其形象塞之。四面倒土堵塞断流。如不见进水现象，就在里坡抢筑月堤，二头进土中留沟出水，俟月堤高出外滩水面，再行倒土，更为稳当。３、如抢救不及，堤岸即冲溃，此时不可惊慌，因此时口门不过数丈。应速在口外下枕、高出外滩水面一二尺，以便缓和水流。同时动员锹手工人，排立堤头，将土铲入，并多人臂挽臂立于缺口内，闭目齐力跳踹，以使土稠而闭塞。
    如堤不能守，终于溃决，应急设法里头（冲断之堤头）以防冲宽，同时计算用料筹划堵口。
