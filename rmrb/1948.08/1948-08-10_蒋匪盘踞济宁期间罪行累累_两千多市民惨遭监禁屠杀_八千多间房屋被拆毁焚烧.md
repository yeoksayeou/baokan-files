(Jilu Yu Electric Dispatch) Jining City, Western Shandong, liberated by the People's Liberation Army on July 14th, saw over one hundred thousand citizens bitterly denounce the atrocities committed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits during their year and nine months of occupation. After the Chiang Kai-shek army under Wu Huawen invaded and occupied Jining City in September 1946, the puppet county government, police station, and "Homecoming Corps" (還鄉團) began a frenzied campaign of arrest and slaughter against the citizens. The former site of the Japanese military police headquarters in Shuangqian within the city quickly became a concentration camp where bandit troops strangled Jining citizens. Because one location was not sufficient, temporary prisons were also established at the Iron Pagoda Temple, West Gate, East Gate, and the County Government entrance. Over two thousand five hundred citizens were arrested. At the northwest corner of the city and beneath the Taibai Tower alone, forty people were killed in two separate incidents. In addition, the bandit troops carried out individual assassinations, stuffing the bodies into burlap sacks and throwing them into the Grand Canal. At the entrance of the Grand Canal into Nanyang Lake, twenty-three corpses were once discovered. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' cruel slaughter could not subdue the people. The women's chairman of Shaojia Street, on the verge of execution, said with fervor: "Dying for liberation is glorious!" The Chiang Kai-shek regiment district conscripted soldiers in Jining for three periods, drafting over one thousand two hundred young and middle-aged men. Many shops were forced to close due to conscription. Young and middle-aged men were unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and fled to the liberated areas in groups. Over two hundred people fled from Yundong Township alone. In order to build city defenses, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits forced citizens to demolish over three thousand houses, leaving thousands of citizens homeless. When our army approached Jining City last July, the bandits and puppets, fearing annihilation, set fire to the streets of Shuncheng Street, Jiangdian Street, and the southern bank of the Grand Canal, burning over five thousand houses. Many residents were burned to death. All three locations of Ma Taisheng's soy sauce garden were burned down, and the manager hanged himself in anger. When the Liberation Army recovered the city from the Japanese invaders in 1946, the city had a population of one hundred and forty thousand, with over two thousand large and small businesses. However, after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits invaded and occupied the city in September 1946, over one thousand factories and shops closed down, including the flour company and the electric light company.

    蒋匪盘踞济宁期间罪行累累
    两千多市民惨遭监禁屠杀
    八千多间房屋被拆毁焚烧
    【冀鲁豫电】七月十四日为人民解放军光复了的鲁西济宁市，十余万市民纷纷悲愤的控诉蒋匪在该市一年又九个月中的暴行。一九四六年九月，蒋匪军吴化文部侵占济宁市后，伪县府警察所还乡团等，便对市民进行了疯狂的捕杀，城内双前日本宪兵队驻地，马上成了匪军们绞杀济宁市民的集中营。因为一处不够用，又在铁塔寺、西门里、东门里、县府口等地，设立临时监狱。被捕的市民达二千五百余人。只西北城角和太白楼下，两次就杀了四十人。此外，匪军们还实行个别暗杀，杀后装入麻袋，投到运河里。南阳湖的运河入口处，曾一次发现二十三具尸体。但是，蒋匪如此残酷的屠杀，并不能使人民屈服。邵家街的妇女会长，临刑时，慷慨激昂的说：“为翻身，死了也是光荣的！”蒋匪团管区，在济宁共征兵三期，征去青壮年一千二百余人，许多商店因被征兵而倒闭。青壮年们都不愿替蒋匪当炮灰，成群的逃入解放区。单运东镇便逃亡了二百多人。蒋匪为了修筑城防，强迫市民们拆掉房子三千多间，使数千市民流离失所。去年七月我军逼近济宁市时，匪伪深恐被歼，竟在城关顺城街、姜店街、及运河南岸各处市街，四处纵火，烧毁房屋达五千余间，不少居民惨遭焚毙。马泰盛酱园三处房子，都被烧光，经理气愤吊死。一九四六年解放军从日寇手中收复该市时，全市共有人口十四万，大小座商二千余家。但至一九四六年九月蒋匪侵占该市后，工厂商店倒闭者达一千多家，其中有面粉公司及电灯公司等。
