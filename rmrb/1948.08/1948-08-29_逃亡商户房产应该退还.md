　　Properties of Escaped Merchants Should Be Returned
　　To the Editor:
　　I am a businessman who has been trading in Handan for five years. In 1946, due to a lack of understanding of the policies, I fled to Tianjin. This March, I received a message from a friend saying that the liberated areas were implementing a policy of protecting industry and commerce and were returning the property left behind by escaped merchants, urging me to return quickly to take over and resume business, and to inform former industrial and commercial friends in the liberated areas to return to their original places to resume business. After receiving this letter, I quickly returned to Handan to go through the procedures for resuming business. I have a few questions that I would like you to answer:
　　I am not a landlord who was struggled against, but a merchant who fled due to a lack of understanding of the policies. After I fled, my house was sold to citizens by the street office. Can it be returned now? I am now returning to Handan to engage in commerce. If my house cannot be returned, it will be very difficult to find a house. What should be done? During a meeting, I heard the director of my street say that my house (fifteen rooms) would be compensated with 500,000 yuan as settlement. The director, however, said that the house was estimated to be worth 1 million yuan in silver dollars. Should our firm return the 500,000 yuan issued by the street office and pay an additional 500,000 yuan in silver dollars to get the house back?

　　Answer: The Communist Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce has been consistent both before and after the implementation of the Land Law. Confiscating and nationalizing the property of escaped merchants is not in accordance with policy and is wrong. It should be corrected now. Since your house has been sold to citizens by the street office, the street office should be responsible for redeeming it and returning the property rights to you. This matter can be resolved through consultation between the Chamber of Commerce, the street office, and the citizens who bought the house.

　　逃亡商户房产应该退还
    编辑同志：
    我是在邯郸经商五年之商人，民国三十五年因不明了政策即逃亡天津，在今年三月间得到朋友的口信，说解放区执行保护工商业政策，并发还逃亡商人遗留之财产，请速回来接收复业，并转告以前在解放区作工商之友好各回原地复业。我得此信后、即速返邯办理复业手续，以下有几个问题请答复一下：
    我不是地主被斗的商人，我是一个不明白政策而逃亡的商人，逃亡后，我的房子已被街公所卖给市民，现在能否退还？我现在返邯经营商业，如我这房不能归还，找房甚不容易，应当如何办法？在开会时，听本街主任谈话，说我这房子（十五间）发还我五十万元作为清理，该主任反说这房子估价值洋一百万元，敝号将街公所发还这五十万元交回，我再出洋五十万元是否能将房子退回？

    答：共产党保护工商业的政策在土地法实行以前和以后都是一致的。把逃亡商户的财产没收充公，是没有按照政策办事，是错误的，现在应该纠正，你的房子既被街公所卖给市民。应由街公所负责赎回，把产权交回给你。此事可请商联会、街公所与买房市民协商解决。
