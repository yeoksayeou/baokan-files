Including the elimination of forces below the battalion level, a total of 1,022,850 enemy regular troops were captured, 676,270 were killed or wounded, and another entire brigade and two entire regiments, one entire battalion and units below the battalion level, totaling 16,930 people, were won over to our side, totaling 1,716,050 people.

	(7) Comparison of the achievements of the second year of the War of Liberation with those of the first year:

	Regarding the elimination of enemy regular troops, in the first year, nine division headquarters, forty-six complete brigades, two brigade headquarters, one hundred and eleven complete regiments, and one hundred and sixty-six complete battalions were eliminated, totaling ninety-seven and a half brigades, or two hundred and ninety-two and a half regiments. Compared with the first year, the second year had three more army headquarters, eleven more division headquarters, three more complete brigades, and nine more brigade headquarters; however, the number of brigades combined was five less, and the number of regiments combined was fifteen less. However, the actual number of regiments should be greater than in the first year; because in the first year, the 46 complete brigades eliminated were mostly two-regiment systems, counted as three regiments including the brigade headquarters; in the second year, the 49 complete brigades eliminated were mostly three-regiment systems, which should be counted as four regiments including the brigade headquarters, but were still only counted as three regiments when combined. Regarding the elimination of enemy regular troops, a total of 780,000 people were eliminated in the first year, including 463,000 enemy regular troops captured, 312,000 killed or wounded, and 5,000 won over to our side. Compared with the first year, the second year eliminated 156,050 more people, including 96,850 more enemy troops captured, 52,270 more enemy troops killed or wounded, and 6,930 more won over to our side. In the first year, an average of eight brigades of enemy regular troops were eliminated each month, with a force of 65,000 people, while in the second year, an average of 7.7 brigades of enemy regular troops were eliminated each month, with a force of 78,000 people.

	Regarding the elimination of enemy non-regular troops, in the first year, one hundred and fourteen complete regiments and fifty-five complete battalions were eliminated, totaling one hundred and twenty-seven regiments and three battalions. Compared with the first year, the second year had sixty-six more complete regiments and one hundred and fourteen more complete battalions, totaling ninety-four more regiments and two more battalions; Regarding the elimination of enemy non-regular troops, a total of 340,000 people were eliminated in the first year, including 214,000 enemy non-regular troops captured, 114,000 killed or wounded, and 12,000 won over to our side. Compared with the first year, the second year eliminated 245,350 more people, including 179,150 more enemy non-regular troops captured, 61,930 more enemy non-regular troops killed or wounded, and 4,270 more won over to our side. In the first year, an average of 10.5 regiments of enemy non-regular troops were eliminated each month, with a force of 28,333 people, while in the second year, an average of 18.5 regiments of enemy non-regular troops were eliminated each month, with a force of 48,779 people. This shows that the enemy's attempt in the second year to prolong their dying fate by strengthening local teams has suffered a disastrous defeat.

	The above two items combined, the second year eliminated three more army headquarters, eleven more division headquarters, and seventy-nine and a half more regiments than the first year, eliminating 401,400 more people, including 276,000 more captured, 114,200 more killed or wounded, and 11,200 more won over to our side. In the first year, an average of 35 regiments of the enemy were eliminated each month, with a total force of 93,333 people, while in the second year, an average of 41.6 regiments of the enemy were eliminated each month, with a total force of 126,783 people.

	Regarding the capture of enemy generals, a total of 176 generals were captured in the first year. The second year had 27 fewer than the first year, including one fewer regular army general and 26 fewer non-regular army generals. Regarding the killing of enemy generals, a total of 26 generals were killed in the first year. The second year killed one fewer enemy non-regular army general than the first year, for a total of 28 fewer captured or killed. However, the second year captured or killed 42 more enemy brigade-level colonels than the first year, including 26 regular army officers and 16 non-regular army officers. Therefore, calculated by enemy officers at or above the brigade-level colonel level, there were still 14 more than in the first year. The reason why the second year captured or killed slightly fewer enemy generals (mainly non-regular army generals) than the first year, while there were more officers at or above the brigade-level colonel level, is because after a large number of enemy generals were captured or killed by our Liberation Army in the first year, those who filled the vacancies were mostly officers with less seniority. At the same time, because in the first year we had basically annihilated the large groups of puppet troops that the enemy had recruited after the Japanese surrender, such as the troops of Sun Dianying, Zhang Lanfeng, Hao Pengju, Hou Ruyong, and Jiang Pengfei, there were fewer enemy non-regular army generals in the second year.

	Regarding the capture of main weapons, in the first year, 389,000 guns of various types, 39,657 machine guns of various types, and 6,166 artillery pieces of various calibers were captured. Compared with the first year, the second year had 154,310 more guns of various types, 9,007 more machine guns of various types, and 2,754 more artillery pieces of various calibers, including 744 more 60mm mortars. Regarding the capture of ammunition, in the first year, 431,000 rounds of various artillery shells and more than 57 million rounds of bullets were captured. Compared with the first year, the second year had more than 400,000 more rounds of various artillery shells and more than 25 million more rounds of bullets.

    （七）解放战争第二年战绩与第一年战绩比较：
    歼敌正规军，第一年歼敌九个师部，四十六个整旅，两个旅部，一百十一个整团，一百六十六个整营，共折合九十七个半旅，或二百九十二个半团。第二年与第一年相较，多三个军部，十一个师部，三个整旅，九个旅部；惟折合旅数少五个，折合团数少十五个。但实际团数应多于第一年；因第一年歼敌四十六个整旅多为两团制，连同旅部计为三个团；第二年歼敌四十九个整旅多为三团制，连同旅部应计为四个团，而折合团数时仍只计为三个团。消灭敌正规军兵力，第一年共七十八万人，计俘敌正规军四十六万三千人，毙伤三十一万二千人，争取其起义五千人。第二年与第一年相较，多消灭十五万六千零五十人，计俘敌军多九万六千八百五十人，毙伤敌军多五万二千二百七十人，争取起义者多六千九百三十人。第一年平均每月歼敌正规军八个旅，兵力六万五千人，第二年则平均每月歼敌正规军七点七个旅，兵力七万八千人。
    歼敌非正规军，第一年一百十四个整团，五十五个整营，共折合一百二十七个团又三个营，第二年与第一年相较多六十六个整团，一百一十四个整营，共折合九十四个团又两个营；消灭敌非正规军兵力第一年共三十四万人，计俘敌非正规军二十一万四千人，毙伤其十一万四千人，争取其起义一万二千人。第二年与第一年相较，多消灭二十四万五千三百五十人，计俘敌非正规军多十七万九千一百五十人，毙伤敌非正规军多六万一千九百三十人，争取起义者多四千二百七十人。第一年平均每月歼敌非正规军十个半团，兵力二万八千三百三十三人，第二年则平均每月歼敌非正规军十八个半团，兵力四万八千七百七十九人。这说明敌人在第二年内，妄想以加强地方团队来延续其垂死的命运的办法，已遭受了惨败。
    以上两项合计，第二年较第一年多歼三个军部，十一个师部，七十九个半团，多消灭四十万一千四百人，计俘虏多二十七万六千人，毙伤多十一万四千二百人，争取起义者多一万一千二百人。第一年平均每月歼敌三十五个团，总兵力九万三千三百三十三人，第二年则平均每月歼敌四十一点六个团，总兵力十二万六千七百八十三人。
    俘敌将级军官，第一年共一百七十六名，第二年较第一年少二十七名，计正规军少一名，非正规军少二十六名；毙敌将级军官第一年共二十六名，第二年较第一年少毙敌非正规军将级军官一名，俘毙共少二十八名；但第二年俘毙敌旅级上校军官则较第一年多四十二名，计正规军二十六名，非正规军十六名。故俘毙敌军官以旅级上校以上军官计算，仍较第一年多十四名。其所以第二年俘毙敌将级军官（主要是非正规军）较第一年略少，而旅级上校以上军官则较多者，是因为敌之将级军官在第一年内被我解放军大量俘毙后，其所填补的多为资历较浅的军官，同时由于在第一年内我已将敌人于日寇投降后所收编的大股伪军，如孙殿英、张岚峰、郝鹏举、侯如墉、姜鹏飞等部基本上歼灭了，故在第二年内敌人的非正规军将级军官便较少了。
    缴获主要武器，第一年各种枪支三十八万九千支，各种机枪三万九千六百五十七挺，各种口径炮六千一百六十六门。第二年与第一年相较，各种枪支增多十五万四千三百一十支，各种机枪增多九千零七挺，各种口径炮增多二千七百五十四门，仅六零炮即增多七百四十四门。缴获弹药，第一年缴各种炮弹四十三万一千发，子弹五千七百余万发，第二年与第一年相较，即各种炮弹增多四十余万发，子弹增多二千五百余万发。
