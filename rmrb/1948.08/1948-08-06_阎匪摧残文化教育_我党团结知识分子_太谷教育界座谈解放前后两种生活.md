Taihang Telegram: On the fourth day after the liberation of Taigu city, the education circle in the city held its first symposium in the auditorium of the county middle school. Sixty-two faculty and staff members from Provincial No. 1 Joint Middle School, County Middle School, No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 Central Elementary Schools, Private Complete Elementary School, and Baylor Complete Elementary School attended. Xu Jingxian, representative of the Taigu Democratic Government, explained in detail to the attendees the policies of the Communist Party and the Democratic Government on protecting schools, developing education, and uniting intellectuals, and welcomed teachers and intellectuals in the newly liberated areas and all mental workers to participate in the educational cause and various constructions in the liberated areas. After understanding the policies of our party and the Democratic Government, the teachers unanimously praised and were very happy. Many people on the spot angrily exposed Yan Xishan's shameless anti-communist propaganda in the past, and accused Yan Xishan of his crimes based on the suffering they had experienced. One teacher accused Yan bandits of beating more than 100 teachers during the "Three Self-Training" in the first month of this year, forcing everyone to admit to communicating with the Eighth Route Army. One teacher was forced to jump into a well and died, and six or seven teachers were arrested to the special police station, and three died of illness. This spring, teachers and students were forced to build bunkers and dig moats on empty stomachs. In the summer, they were told to follow the army to rob wheat, and the suffering was unbearable. Some teachers and students were forced to cut wheat for the villagers to earn some wheat for a living. This time, when the Yan bandits fled north, although they threatened the teachers and students of the school to follow, most people had long been looking forward to the liberation of our army and were not deceived by the Yan bandits. When talking about the education situation under the rule of Yan bandits, Liu Jingrong, an elementary school teacher, denounced Yan Xishan's crimes of destroying culture and education and strangling young people's freedom of thought. He said: "The school curriculum can only talk about the reactionary things of integrating soldiers and farmers, distributing according to labor, and the securities of products to rule the people. We are not allowed to know the real things at home and abroad, and the situation in the liberated areas is even less allowed to be mentioned. The school is full of terror." Wu Sipu, a teacher at the First Central Elementary School who had suffered torture from Yan bandits, accused Yan bandits of persecuting him with infinite hatred: "Last year, during the self-confession and regeneration, the Yan bandit secret agents twisted the wet hemp rope and beat me all over with bruises, and I couldn't move for more than ten days, saying that I was the Communist Party's district committee. I live in the city. Can I see the Communist Party in the city?" Li Ruixiang, a teacher at the Second Central Elementary School, requested that the government introduce more new books and magazines in the future and talk more about new issues in order to make progress faster. Female teacher Dong Suyin hoped that the government could provide specific help and point out the way so as to better transform herself to serve the people. Government representatives gave satisfactory answers. Now all schools are busy tidying up the school buildings and preparing to resume classes quickly.

    太谷教育界座谈解放前后两种生活
    【太行电】太谷城解放后的第四天，该县城内教育界假县立中学大礼堂召开首次座谈会，到会省立第一联中，县立中学，第一、二、三、四中心学校，私立完小，贝露完小等教职员六十二名。太谷民主政府代表徐敬贤同志向到会者详细阐明共产党及民主政府保护学校、发展教育和团结知识分子的政策，欢迎新解放区教员及知识分子及一切脑力劳动者参加解放区教育事业及各种建设。与会各教员了解我党及民主政府政策后，教员们一致赞扬，非常愉快，很多人当场愤慨揭露阎锡山过去无耻的反共宣传，并用自己所遭受的痛苦控诉阎锡山的罪行。一个教员控诉阎匪在今年正月“三自传训”时，殴打了一百多个教员，逼着大家承认通八路。一个教员逼的跳井而死，六、七个教员被捉到特警所，病死三个。今春强迫教员学生饿肚修碉堡挖城壕，夏天叫跟上军队出去抢麦子，其生活之苦真是不堪言语。有的教员和学生被迫给老乡割麦子，赚得一些麦子为生。这次阎匪北逃时，虽曾威迫学校师生跟上走，但多数人早盼我军解放，没让阎匪骗走。谈到阎匪统治下教育情况时，小学教员刘景荣指斥阎锡山摧残文化教育，绞杀青年思想自由的罪行。他说：“学校课程只能讲兵农合一、按劳分配、物产证券一套反动的统治人民的东西，国内外真实的事情不让大家知道，解放区情况更不让提。学校充满了恐怖。”曾经遭受阎匪酷刑的第一中心学校教员武思朴以无限愤恨控诉阎匪对他的迫害：“去年自白转生时，阎匪特务用扭住的湿麻绳打的我浑身青紫，十几天不能行动，说我是共产党的区委，我住在城内，城里能见到共产党？”第二中心学校教员李瑞祥要求政府今后多给介绍些新书杂志，多谈些新问题，以期更快获得进步，女教员董漱荫希望政府能经常给以具体帮助，指明道路，以便更好改造自己为人民服务，政府代表均给以圆满答复。现在各校均在忙着整理校舍，准备迅速复课。
