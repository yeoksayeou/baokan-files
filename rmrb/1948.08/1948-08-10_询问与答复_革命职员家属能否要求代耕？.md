    Inquiry and Reply
    Can Family Members of Revolutionary Cadres Request Substitute Farming?
    Editor:
    It was previously reported in the newspaper that political and civil cadres are not entitled to substitute farming. Now, the county government has also issued a notice stating that substitute farming will not be provided. However, many cadres have families with only women and children, lacking labor. Can such families be provided with substitute farming? How should this issue be resolved? We hope the newspaper can provide a reply, as this is not a problem limited to one county.
    Ci County Public Security Bureau Li Zengwang, Zhao Hongyou
    Comrades Li Zengwang and Zhao Hongyou: Regarding the issue of substitute farming for family members of political and civil cadres, it should be resolved in accordance with the regulations of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Branch of the Party Committee on the issue of substitute farming for family members of revolutionary cadres (see this newspaper three days ago). Some cadre families face extreme hardship and lack labor. If they genuinely cannot maintain a livelihood by leasing land or employing labor, according to Article 3 of the regulations: the individual may request approval from the district office to adopt the preferential treatment measures for revolutionary military family members and provide substitute farming for a portion of the land, or substitute farming for the main labor portion of the land.

    询问与答复
    革命职员家属能否要求代耕？
    编辑同志：
    从前报上登过政民干部不代耕，现县府亦下了通知不给代耕，但很多干部队员，家里只有女人小孩无劳力，象这样的家庭，是否代耕。这问题如何解决，希报上答复，因这不是一个县的小问题。
    磁县公安局  李增旺、赵鸿有
    李增旺、赵鸿有同志：关于政民干部家属代耕问题，应依照晋冀鲁豫边府与晋察冀行党委员会规定革命职员家属代耕问题解决（见三日本报）。有些干部家庭生活极端困难，缺乏劳力，以土地出租或雇工经营，确实不能维持生活的，按该规定第三条：其本人可请求区公所批准，酌量采用革命军人家属优待办法，代耕一部土地，或代耕其一部土地之主要劳动部分。        ——编者
