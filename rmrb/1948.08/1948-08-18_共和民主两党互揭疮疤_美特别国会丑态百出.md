Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: A comprehensive report: The special session of Congress convened by US President Truman on July 26th for the benefit of the Democratic Party's election, after 13 days of wrangling due to the Republican and Democratic parties exposing each other's crimes, ended in a complete farce and hastily adjourned on the evening of the 7th. After using his presidential power to convene a special session of Congress, the Democratic Truman administration submitted a message to the Republican-controlled Congress on the 27th, requesting the latter to enact legislation to control prices and solve the housing shortage. This high-price policy, which is a high-level exploitation policy against the American people, is originally a basic policy of American monopoly capital domestically, and both the Democratic and Republican parties adhere to this policy. This proposal was clearly forcing the Republican Party to make a fool of itself in front of the public. In order to turn the tables on the Democratic Party, the Republican-controlled Congress decided to first discuss the anti-poll tax bill, which demanded the abolition of the system in the Southern states controlled by the Democratic Party that restricted blacks and poor whites from participating in elections by paying a poll tax. The purpose of the Republican Party's decision was to expose the Democratic Party's sore spots, thereby provoking opposition from Southern Democratic congressmen in order to delay the proceedings and prevent the price and housing shortage issues from being discussed. After the US Senate submitted the anti-poll tax bill on the 29th, Southern Democratic congressmen, with "the approval of the Republican leadership" (TASS), "leisurely carried out filibustering speeches" (Associated Press), until August 4th, the procedural issue of including the anti-poll tax bill on the agenda had not been resolved, and finally the inclusion of the bill on the agenda was rejected. At the same time, the House of Representatives only "listened to aimless and irrelevant speeches, and did not discuss any of the bills proposed for convening this meeting" (TASS). Finally, because neither party dared to publicly reveal their reactionary faces, the two houses of Congress hurriedly and perfunctorily passed the so-called anti-inflation bill and housing bill, which were inconsistent with the title, within a short period of three days from the 5th to the 7th. The former advocated restricting consumer credit and bank lending to "prevent inflation," but took no action at all on the anti-price hike measures urgently needed by the broad masses of the American people; the latter vaguely advocated encouraging private construction of houses for rent to solve the housing shortage, while avoiding mentioning the construction of large-scale public housing and the elimination of slums.
    In order to divert the people's attention from solving the soaring prices and the housing panic, the Republican Congress had raised the so-called "Soviet espionage conspiracy in the United States" issue since July 30th. They said that many past and present senior officials in the US government were "Soviet spies." But as a result, Truman, who has always played anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracies, had to point out, as if confessing himself, that the so-called "Soviet spy" case was a "Republican action to divert the people's attention."
    In short, Truman's "cheap performance in Congress to win over liberal voters" "ended in failure" amid heightened ugliness (Den'etsu News Agency). On the other hand, the Republican Congress's disregard for the people's demands and the tricks it played in the election also aroused the anger of the American people. "Many mass organizations in the United States, with the support of the Progressive Party," have lodged protests with Congress, "demanding that Congress formulate genuine price control and adequate housing bills." (TASS) Three thousand members of the Civil Rights Congress also went to Washington on the 5th and surrounded the White House, demanding the passage of civil rights programs, curbing prices, and providing people with sufficient housing.

### 共和民主两党互揭疮疤　美特别国会丑态百出

　　共和民主两党互揭疮疤
  　美特别国会丑态百出
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合报导：美总统杜鲁门于七月二十六日为了民主党竞选利益而召开的国会特别会议，因为共和、民主两党互相揭露罪恶事实，经过十三日的争吵，弄得丑态百出，乃于七日晚草草闭幕。民主党的杜鲁门政府于利用其总统权力召开特别国会后，即于二十七日向共和党控制的国会提出咨文，要求后者制定管制物价及解决房荒等立法。这种高物价政策，也就是对美国人民的高度榨取政策，本来是美国独占资本对国内的基本政策，民主、共和两党都奉行着这个政策。这一提案明明是逼共和党在公众面前出丑。共和党的国会为了反将民主党一军，乃决定首先讨论反人头税议案，其中要求取消民主党所控制的南方诸州以缴纳人头税来限制黑人与贫苦白人参加选举的制度。共和党这一决定，目的在揭开民主党的疮疤，因而挑起南方民主党议员的反对，以便拖延议事进程，使物价与房荒问题无从讨论。美参院于二十九日提出反人头税议案后，南方民主党议员即在“共和党领导机构的赞同下”（塔斯社），“悠然进行拖延议事的发言”（合众社），直至八月四日，尚未解决将反人头税议案列入议程的程序问题，并终于否决将该案列入议程。同时，众院只是“听取毫无目的、毫不相干的演说，而并不讨论任何为召开此次会议所提出的议案”（塔斯社）。最后，因为两党的反动面貌都不敢公开见人，国会两院于五日至七日的短短三天内，匆匆忙忙敷敷衍衍地通过了文不对题的所谓反通货膨胀案及房屋法案，前者主张以限制消费者的赊帐与银行信用放款来“防止通货膨胀”，而对美国广大人民所急需的反物价高涨措施，根本不采取行动；后者则空洞地主张鼓励私人建筑房屋出租来解决房荒，而对建筑大量大众住宅及消除贫民窟，亦避而不谈。
    共和党国会为了转移人民对解决物价高涨与房屋恐慌的注意，曾自七月三十日起提出了所谓“苏联在美间谍阴谋”问题。他们说，美政府中许多过去和现在的高级官员，均为“苏联间谍”。但其结果，却迫使一向玩弄反苏反共阴谋的杜鲁门，不得不等于自供一样，指出所谓“苏联间谍”案，乃是共和党“转移人民视线的行动”。
    总之，杜鲁门为了“争取自由主义选民而在国会中进行的廉价表演”，是在丑恶益彰的情况下“归于失败了”（电通社）。另一方面，共和党国会之不顾人民要求与玩弄竞选的诡计，也引起了美国人民的愤怒。“美国许多群众团体在进步党的支持下”，曾向国会提出抗议，“要求国会制定真正的管制物价与充足的房屋法案。”（塔斯社）民权大会的会员三千人，且于五日齐往华府，并包围白宫，要求通过民权计划、遏止物价，且供给人民以充分的房屋。
