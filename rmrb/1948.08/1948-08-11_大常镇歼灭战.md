　　Annihilation Battle of Dachang Town
    Bing Ru, Yang Ming
    Seizing the Group Bunker

　　Yan Xishan's 34th Army, under the command of Gao Zhuozhi, including the 73rd Division and the Provisional 44th Division, was the main force cultivated by Yan Xishan from 1944 onwards to maintain his reactionary rule. After this army joined Zhao Shouzheng's 33rd Army in Qi County and Pingyao, they attempted to夹击 (attack from both sides) the People's Liberation Army in the narrow area between Taigu and Xugou, but were completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in Dachang Town. Dachang Town is located between Xugou and Taigu, along the Xiangyu River embankment, extending about three or four *li* from east to west. The enemy utilized this long street, deploying caltrops everywhere, forming three lines of defense in depth. The Tianzhu Church area in the southeast corner was the command post for the enemy's army and division headquarters. The northwest corner and the high buildings on the cross street were fortified with group bunkers, attempting to prevent the People's Liberation Army from approaching from both sides. At dawn on July 11th, two spearheads of the People's Liberation Army advanced in parallel from west to east. After artillery bombardment, one unit inserted itself into the core of Dachang from the south, smoothly maneuvering to the enemy's group bunker in front of the bell and drum tower at the cross street. Another assault team, led by Li Haishui's company, broke through the forward positions in the northwest corner. After continuous explosions, they broke through the walls and captured four courtyards on the forward position. However, they encountered the crossfire from the enemy's group bunkers on the road ahead. The enemy had a battalion of troops in the group bunkers. After retreating from the front line to the group bunker positions, they thought they had a strong support and refused to retreat further. Ma Shangfa, the squad leader of the 2nd squad of the hero Li Haishui Company, set up a machine gun and fired at the gun holes of the enemy's bunkers, covering the engineering squad. After four consecutive explosions, a large hole, like a gate, was blasted open in the lower layer of the bunker in the northwest corner. The warriors of the assault group's 5th squad, squad leader Liu Xicheng, vice squad leader Wang Zhengping, and others, were the first to rush into the explosion hole. As they climbed the ladder, they found two or three enemies coming down from the roof to the second floor. It turned out that they wanted to sneak away when the explosion occurred, but they came back after the explosion, thinking it was safe. Who knew that as soon as they entered the building, one of them was shot dead by Wang Zhengping, and the rest were scared away. Li Haishui Company's 5th squad captured the blockhouse, controlling a series of courtyards in the northwest corner. At this time, the enemy completely fled to a series of courtyards on the south side of the street, climbing onto the roofs and blockhouses, using machine guns to stop our army from advancing on the opposite side. The warriors of the 2nd and 6th squads of Li Haishui Company also climbed onto the roofs, using machine guns and grenades to suppress the enemy's firepower. Then the 6th squad jumped down from the roof and rushed to the enemy's street gate on the opposite side. A burst of explosive charges forced fifty enemies into the house, scaring them to their knees, shouting, "We surrender! We surrender!" More than ten enemies who tried to escape were also persuaded by our calls to lay down their weapons. The group bunker was thus occupied by us.
    Besieging and Annihilating the Army Headquarters

　　After all the group bunkers were cleared, the Tianzhu Church, where the 34th Army headquarters was located, was completely exposed to our army. From the afternoon of the 12th, our army launched a general offensive against Yan's 34th Army headquarters. Before the general offensive, our army launched a heated challenge movement on the front line. The 4th company of a certain unit wrote to the 6th company, saying, "Please let us have the task!" The 6th company replied, "We are determined to complete the task assigned to us by our superiors, please rest assured." They also proposed not to fear hardship and difficulty in the battle, to learn from Li Haishui's heroic and tenacious spirit, and not to let a single enemy escape. The 9th squad of the assault team of the 6th company of a certain unit wanted to compete with a team to capture prisoners, to see who captured more.

　　The battle began. The assault team of the 5th company of a certain unit, like divine soldiers descending from heaven, approached the enemy's army headquarters building in the Tianzhu Church in the blink of an eye. A grenade disarmed more than fifty guards. After the 1st platoon, 2nd squad climbed through a small door, they saw groups of Yan's officers sitting and clamoring on rows of benches in the chapel. Unexpectedly, they threw grenades in from the window, and the enemy was thrown into chaos. Ouyang Ming, a liberated soldier from Linfen, broke open the gate with a bayonet and rushed in, shouting, "Put down your guns and walk out, we guarantee not to kill you!" Fifty or sixty field grade officers from Yan's 34th Army Political Department, Staff Office, and Mountain Artillery Battalion were captured on the spot. As dusk fell, our units, cooperating with each other, continued to attack the enemy of the guard battalion of the enemy’s command post from both the east and west. They charged and fought with the enemy, passed through two strings of courtyards, and rushed to the enemy's army headquarters command post in one breath. Squad leader Wang Li scratched his head and got injured. The company commander advised him to go down, but he said, "What is this? We must complete the task!" He resolutely refused to leave the front line, still holding his machine gun, covering other brothers to carry out earthwork operations, and rushed directly to the backyard of the army command post. The enemy guard battalion struggled in the bunker. With the sound of our army's explosives, the warriors of the assault team, Sun Binghua, Gao Zhihua, Sun Jiquan, Zhao Zhengxian, and Li Huating, rushed into the backyard with bayonets, shouting in unison, "Surrender and be spared!" The enemies were frightened out of their wits. A Yan officer poked his head out of the cave and asked, "Comrade Eighth Route Army, are you really not going to kill us?" The liberated soldier Li Huating immediately replied, "I was liberated from Linfen. The People's Liberation Army not only does not kill me, but there is no beating or scolding. Come over quickly!" Two hundred and seventy enemies from the guard battalion and the army command post laid down their weapons, clapped their hands empty, and crawled out of the bunkers and caves. The bravery of the People's Liberation Army really frightened them. When the People's Liberation Army led them out of the army headquarters compound, their faces were pale, and as soon as they heard the sound of an explosion, they quickly fell to the ground, asking, "Is it okay?" A company commander who had served in Yan's 34th Army for more than twenty years said, "I have fought for more than twenty years, and I have never seen such a brave and powerful army."
    Resolutely Eliminate the Enemy If They Don't Surrender

　　After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the main force of Yan's 34th Army, the 71st Division, which he had painstakingly cultivated for more than 20 years, was completely wiped out. The remnants of the Provisional 44th Division and the Provisional 45th Division were also completely annihilated. Only one independent courtyard in the southwest corner remained, where the 4th company of the 217th Regiment of the 73rd Division was still resisting stubbornly, attempting to cover the remnants of his division headquarters to break through and escape in the rain. The warriors of the 2nd Battalion of a certain unit of our army accepted the order from the regimental leader: "Resolutely eliminate the enemy if they don't surrender." The warriors of Li Haishui Company also rushed up from the second echelon, using single-soldier demolition teams to attack the enemy's heart directly, disrupting the stubborn resistance of the enemy. As soon as the explosion sounded, the ladder team rushed across the alley and set up the ladder. Squad leader Liu Xicheng bravely and resourcefully braved the dust from the enemy's thrown grenades and attacked into the courtyard, also using grenades to counterattack the enemy. The warriors of another unit also pressed down from the roof, making the enemy have nowhere to go. The enemy's "Iron Army" key platoon leader was killed by the explosion. An instructor who was carrying a war knife and supervising the battle in the room also tucked his tail and fled from the tunnel. The heavy machine gun directly controlled by Yan's "Iron Army" key officers could no longer be heard. All the soldiers of the 4th company of the enemy's 217th Regiment stopped resisting. As Yan said, they became our army's conscription brigade. The 5th squad of the hero Li Haishui Company alone captured six machine guns, three small guns, and more than twenty rifles. Comrade Li Haishui gloriously sacrificed in the final pursuit battle of the liberation of Linfen, but the glorious Li Haishui Company has emerged more outstanding heroes like him in this Jinzhong Campaign. In the continuous battle to encircle and annihilate Yan's bandits, they continued to carry forward Comrade Li Haishui's tenacious, brave, and resourceful fighting style.

　　大常镇歼灭战
    冰如、杨明
    攻占集团碉
    阎匪三十四军高卓之部七十三师、暂四十四师等主力，是阎匪锡山从民国三十三年起培养起来维持他反动统治的本钱，该军在祁县、平遥与赵绶之三十三军会合后，企图在太谷徐沟之间的狭长地带夹击解放军，但却被解放军在大常镇全部歼灭了。大常镇位于徐沟太谷之间，沿着象峪河大堤，东西长约三四里。敌人利用这道长街，到处配置鹿砦，构成了三道纵深防御阵地，东南角天主堂一带，是匪军部和师部指挥所，西北角和十字街高房，均筑有集团城堡，妄图阻止解放军从两侧接近，七月十一日拂晓，解放军的两支矛头，从西向东平行发展，某部在排炮轰击下，从正南插入大常核心，顺利的运动到十字街钟鼓楼前敌人集团碉跟前。另部突击队李海水连的勇士们，突破西北角前沿阵地后，连续爆破，打通墙壁，攻占了前沿阵地上的四座院子。但在前进道路上，碰到敌人集团碉堡交叉火力的阻击。集团碉上有敌人一个营的兵力，他们从前沿退缩到集团碉阵地后，以为有了靠山，再也不退了。我杀敌英雄李海水连二班长马尚法，架起机枪对准敌人碉堡的枪眼射击，掩护着工兵小组，连续爆炸了四次，最后是西北墙角的碉堡下层，炸开了个大门大的窟窿，突击组的勇士五班正副班长刘喜成、王正平等三人，首先突进爆破口，刚爬上梯子，发现两三个敌人，正好从屋顶上下到二层楼来，原来他们是想当炸破时溜走，炸药响后又溜回来，以为这样很保险。谁知他们刚一进楼门，就叫王正平打死了一个，其余的都吓跑了，李海水连五班突击小组占领了这座炮楼，控制了西北角上的一串院子。这时敌人完全逃到街南面的一串院子，爬到屋项和炮楼上面用机枪阻止对面我军前进。李海水连二班、六班的勇士们，也跟着爬上屋顶，用机枪炸弹把敌人的火力压下去，接着六班就跳下房来，向对面敌人的街门猛冲过去，一阵排子炸弹，把五十个敌人逼到屋里，吓得敌人纷纷跪倒地上，连声叫道：“我们缴枪！我们缴枪！”另外十多个夺路逃窜的敌人，也被我们喊话争取过来，放下了武器，集团碉就这样被我们占领了。
    围歼军部
    集团碉被全部解决后，三十四军军部所在地的天主堂完全暴露在我军面前，从十二日午后起，我军对阎匪三十四军军部发动总攻。总攻前，我军在火线上展开了热烈的挑战运动，某部四连给六连写信说：“请你们把任务让给我们吧！”六连回答道：“我们决心完成上级给我们的任务，请你们放心吧。”他们并提出在战斗中不怕艰苦困难，学习李海水的英勇顽强精神，不让敌人跑掉一个，某部六连突击队九班，要和一队比赛捉俘虏，看谁捉的多。
    战斗开始了，某部五连的突击队，好象神兵天降，转眼间逼近了天主堂内敌军军部大楼，一颗炸弹，解除了五十多个警卫部队的武装、一排二班后小门爬进窗子，看见礼拜堂内一排一排的长凳上，坐着一群一群的阎匪军官正在混吵。他们猛不防的把炸弹从窗外扔进去，敌人顿时乱成一团。临汾解放战士欧阳明一刺刀挑开大门冲进去，大叫：“放下枪往外走，保证不杀你们！”阎匪三十四军政治部、参谋处、山炮营五六十个校尉级长官，当场都被擒住了。天黄昏了，我某某两部，互相配合，从东西两面继续夹击匪军指挥所警卫营的敌人。他们和敌人冲杀搏斗，穿过两串院子，一股劲冲到敌人军部指挥所。班长王立挠头部挂了彩，连长劝他下去，他说：“这算个啥？非完成任务不行”！坚决不下火线，仍端着机枪，掩护着其他弟兄进行土工作业，直接向军指挥所后院猛扑，敌警卫营在地堡里挣扎着，我军炸药一响，突击组孙炳华、高志华、孙继全、赵正先、李华停的勇士，就端着刺刀冲进后院，齐喊：“缴枪不杀”。敌人吓得丧魂失魄，有一个阎匪军官从地洞里探出头来问道：“八路同志，你们真不杀吗？”解放战士李华停即刻回答道：“我是临汾解放过来的，人民解放军不但不杀我，连打骂现象也没啦。你们赶快过来吧！”警卫营和军指挥所二百七十个敌人，都把武器放下，拍着空手，从地堡里、地洞里钻了出来。解放军的勇猛，把他们实在吓坏了。当解放军带着他们走出军部大院时，一个个面如土色，一听爆炸声响，很快跌倒地上，连问“不要紧吧”？一个曾在阎匪三十四军当过二十余年兵的连长说：“我打了二十多年仗，没见过你们这样勇猛、火力这样厉害的军队。”
    敌人不投降就坚决消灭他
    经过两天一夜的激战，阎苦心培养二十余年的三十四军七十一师主力，已全军覆灭了。暂四十四师和暂四十五师残部，也全部被歼，只有西南角一座独立院，敌人七十三师二一七团第四连还在凭坚顽抗，企图掩护他师部残部冒雨突围逃窜，我某部二营的勇士们接受了团首长的命令：“敌人不投降就坚决消灭他”。李海水连的勇士们，也从二梯队赶上来，以单兵爆破小组，直扑敌人心脏，把负隅顽抗的敌人打乱，爆破声一响，架梯组就冲过巷道搭梯子，班长刘喜成英勇机智敢冒着敌军投掷弹的灰尘，攻进院内还用炸弹还击敌人。另部勇士们又从房顶上压下来，打的敌人走头无路。敌“铁军”基干排长被炸死了，一个提着战刀在屋里督战的指导员，也夹着尾巴从地道里逃跑了，由阎匪“铁军”基干直接掌握的那挺重机枪，再也听不到响声。敌二一七团四连战士，全部停止了抵抗。正如阎匪所说，做了我军的兵役大队。只杀敌英雄李海水连第五班，就缴敌六挺机枪，三门小炮，廿多支步枪。李海水同志是在解放临汾最后追击战中光荣牺牲的，但光荣的李海水连，在这次晋中战役中，又涌现出了更多象他一样的出色英雄。在围歼阎匪连续战斗中，继续发扬了李海水同志顽强、英勇、机智的战斗作风。
