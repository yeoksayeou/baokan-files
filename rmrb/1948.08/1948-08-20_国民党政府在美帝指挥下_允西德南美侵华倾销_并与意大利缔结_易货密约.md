Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Under the command of its American masters, the traitorous Kuomintang government has begun so-called "barter" trade with West Germany, South America, and Italy. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 12th, citing "foreign trade figures," the Kuomintang government "has put forward proposals to arrange large-scale barter trade between China and West Germany, and plans to expand barter trade agreements with Western European countries and South America." The dispatch further cited "reliable sources" as reporting that the Kuomintang government has "concluded a barter secret agreement" with Italy. A Central News Agency Shanghai dispatch on the same day admitted that the Kuomintang authorities "have begun Sino-German barter work, which has been contacted by the China Trust Bureau with the Allied authorities in Germany and has obtained preliminary permission." The above news revealed that the Kuomintang government is prepared to supply Germany and Italy with Chinese soybeans, peanuts, and other agricultural products, while allowing Italian rayon and so-called "German scientific instruments and production equipment" to be dumped in China. According to the "Bilateral Agreement" signed between the Kuomintang government and the United States on July 3, it has been clearly stipulated that China must grant West Germany "most-favored-nation treatment" in commerce. The Central News Agency dispatch on the same day also admitted that the Kuomintang has agreed to "allow the U.S. occupied areas and Uruguay most-favored-nation treatment."

    【新华社陕北十八日电】国民党卖国政府在其美国主子指挥下，开始与西德、南美及意大利进行所谓“易货”贸易。据合众社上海十二日电引“对外贸易人士”消息称：国民党政府“已提出安排中国与西德间的大规模易货贸易的建议，并计划扩大与西欧国家及南美的易货贸易协定。”该电继引据“可靠方面报导”称：国民党政府已与意大利“缔结易货密约”。同日中央社上海消息则承认：国民党当局“已着手进行中德易货工作，此事已由中信局与德境盟军当局接洽，并获初步许可。”上述消息披露：国民党政府准备以中国大豆、花生及其他农产品供应德、意，而让意大利人造丝及所谓“德国科学仪器及生产器材”来华倾销。按七月三日国民党政府和美国签订的“双边协定”中，已明白规定中国必须在商务上给西德以“最惠国待遇”，同日中央社消息并承认国民党已答应“允许予美各占领区及乌拉圭以最惠国待遇”。
