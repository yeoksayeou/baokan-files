Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to combined reports: Less than two weeks after the Kuomintang authorities announced the issuance of new banknotes with denominations of 5 million yuan and other amounts, a new wave of price increases in Shanghai's financial and commodity markets began on July 30th. To date, the prices of various commodities have risen to new peaks. On the 14th, rice rose to 65 million yuan per dan (KMT currency, same below), exceeding the highest price of 24 million yuan per dan during the peak of the price surge on the 6th by more than 170%, and also exceeding the highest price of 40 million yuan per dan before the issuance of the new banknotes in July by more than 62%. On the same day, the black market price of US dollars rose to a new high of 11.5 million yuan per dollar, exceeding the highest price of 7.2 million yuan per dollar before the issuance of the banknotes by slightly less than 60%, and also exceeding the price of 9 million yuan per dollar when this new wave of price increases began (July 30th) by slightly less than 28%. As for the prices of other commodities, according to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 8th: "There have also been considerable increases." Various public utilities and transportation services, after raising prices continuously last month, increased prices again at the beginning of this month, further stimulating price increases. The Kuomintang authorities have announced that, starting on the 5th, various public utility fees in Shanghai will increase by 100% to 390%. At the same time, train passenger tickets in various places have increased by 200%, ship tickets have increased by 120%, and air tickets have increased by an average of 34%. The Kuomintang government's issuance of new banknotes was accompanied by planned emergency actions to suppress the market. On July 19th, the second day after the issuance of the new banknotes, a large number of economic secret service police were dispatched to strengthen market controls, financial authorities stopped lending, and strictly restricted remittances to Shanghai from various places. At the same time, some of the funds originally circulating in the market flowed out. As a result, in the following days, credit was slightly tighter, and there was no significant price surge in the general financial and commodity markets. Among them, the price of US dollars even fell slightly. However, this was only a temporary phenomenon, and on July 30th, the 13th day after the issuance of the new banknotes, the market began to experience this new wave of price increases, which continues to this day.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: According to combined reports: Immediately after the Kuomintang authorities announced the issuance of new banknotes on the 18th, the Kuomintang's cities, large and small, also experienced a widespread new wave of price increases, similar to Shanghai. When the news of the issuance of new banknotes reached Tianjin on the evening of July 19th, shops and stores rushed to change their price tags until midnight (Tianjin Dagong Bao). The next day, rice rose to 420,000 yuan per jin, and on the 27th, it rose to a peak of 520,000 yuan per jin, an increase of more than 44% compared to the 360,000 yuan per jin at the end of June. On the 20th, Hong Wu Fu cloth rose to 51 million yuan per bolt, an increase of more than 64% compared to the 31 million yuan per bolt at the end of June. On the 27th, millet rose to 380,000 yuan per jin, an increase of 25% compared to the 250,000 yuan per jin at the end of June. During the same period, corn flour rose by slightly less than 65% to a high price of 280,000 yuan per jin. In Beiping, on the third day after the announcement of the issuance of the new banknotes (i.e., July 20th), prices skyrocketed, and several department stores spent the entire day changing price tags (Tianjin Yishibao). On that day, cotton and woolen fabrics almost doubled in price, and ordinary daily necessities also increased by 30% to 70%. Even small sesame cakes and steamed buns, as small as silver dollars, rose from 30,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan each in one day. By the 27th, rice had risen to 520,000 yuan per jin, a doubling compared to the 260,000 yuan per jin on June 20th. During the same period, flour rose by more than 168% to a high price of 21 million yuan per bag. Silver coins rose from 4.1 million yuan per yuan on July 20th to 5.3 million yuan on the 27th. In Qingdao, "Soldier Ship" brand flour rose to 16.8 million yuan per bag on the 19th, exceeding the 6.5 million yuan per bag at the end of June by more than 158%. During the same period, Da Shuang Long cotton cloth rose by slightly less than 126% to 53 million yuan per bolt. In Nanjing, on July 19th, silver coins rose to 3.6 million yuan per yuan, an increase of more than 38% compared to the 2.6 million yuan per yuan at the end of June, and were being bought but not sold. The prices of other hardware goods rose by 50%. In Wuxi, on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, according to a Associated Press dispatch on July 20th: "The market is chaotic, and all merchants are refusing to sell their goods." In Hankou, after the announcement of the issuance of new banknotes, people were panicked and the market was unprecedentedly chaotic. Gold and paper money took the lead, and prices of all goods rose sharply. On July 20th, the price of rice broke through 30 million yuan per dan, exceeding the 10.08 million yuan per dan in mid-June by more than 177%. In Guangzhou, according to a report in the Tianjin Minguo Daily on July 25th, in the past three days, Hong Kong dollars have jumped from 700,000 yuan to over 1 million yuan each. The price of rice has doubled, with medium-grade rice rising from 20 million yuan per dan to 40 million yuan per dan. The prices of all daily necessities have increased several times. Ordinary transactions in the city have refused to use banknotes of 10,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan.
