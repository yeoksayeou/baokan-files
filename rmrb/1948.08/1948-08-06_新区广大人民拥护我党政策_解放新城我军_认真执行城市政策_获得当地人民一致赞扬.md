[A dispatch from the Pingbao Front] During the battle to liberate Xincheng on the Pingbao Front, the People's Liberation Army maintained excellent discipline and earnestly implemented the CCP's urban policies, earning unanimous praise from the local people. On the 16th, after the People's Liberation Army entered Xincheng, they immediately posted public notices and propaganda leaflets on the streets to reassure the people, and repeatedly explained the Communist Party's various policies. All ownerless shops and houses were guarded, and idlers were strictly forbidden from entering. Residents were also mobilized to invite the shop owners and homeowners back to resume business without worry. The PLA soldiers and the staff of the democratic government were all kind and amiable to the residents. No one idled about in the streets, and no one entered civilian houses without permission or touched so much as a needle or thread belonging to the residents. The next day, residents who had fled under the deception of Wang Fenggang's propaganda returned one after another. Most of the shops reopened for business. In front of the temporary exchange set up by the city management committee, people were crowded, exchanging KMT currency for border region currency. Women also came out, and children jumped and played in the streets, and the whole city suddenly became lively. The residents unanimously praised the People's Liberation Army, saying, "You are really a good army; you don't even drink people's water." The city had been ruled successively by Japanese invaders and Wang Fenggang for more than ten years, and many residents had been so oppressed that their families were ruined. Now, the democratic government has distributed more than 12,000 catties of relief grain to help the poor people in the city, including the poor families of puppet soldiers and puppet organization personnel.

    新区广大人民拥护我党政策
    解放新城我军
    认真执行城市政策
    获得当地人民一致赞扬
    【平保前线一日电】平保前线解放军解放新城战斗中，纪律优良，认真执行中共城市政策，博得当地人民一致赞扬。十六日，解放军进驻新城后，立即在街上发贴安民布告和宣传品，并反复解释共产党的各种政策。对无人看守的商店、房屋，一律派人守卫，严禁闲人入内，并动员街坊四邻请各该店主房主回来安心营业。解放军战士和民主政府的工作人员，对居民态度，均和蔼可亲，没有一个人在街上闲串，没有一个人擅自进入民房，翻动居民的一针一线。第二天，受王匪凤岗欺骗宣传而逃亡在外的居民，纷纷归来。多数的商店开张营业。城市管理委员会所设立的临时兑换所前，挤满着以蒋币兑换边币的人们。妇女们也出来了，孩子们在街头蹦跳玩耍，全城顿时热闹起来。居民们一致赞扬解放军说：“你们真是好队伍，连口水都不喝人们的。”该城曾受日寇及王匪凤岗先后统治了十余年，许多居民，被压榨得家破人亡。现民主政府已先后发放赈粮一万二千多斤，救济城内贫民，其中包括伪军伪组织人员的贫苦家属。
