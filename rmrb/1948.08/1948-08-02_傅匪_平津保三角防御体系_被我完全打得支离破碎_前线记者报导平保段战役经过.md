Xinhua News Agency, Pingbao Front, 31st—Our frontline reporter reports on the Pingbao sector campaign, stating: At 00:00 on the 16th, the powerful field army of the North China People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local forces, crossed the Yi River and the Juma River and launched a full-scale offensive along the more than 300-li corridor of the Kuomintang army between Baoding and Changxindian. At 1:00 AM on the 16th, Laishui City was captured first. With a 60-li rapid assault, Xincheng County, where the bandit Wang Fenggang was entrenched, was liberated in one fell swoop, destroying the three fortress lines from Xincheng to Gaobeidian, Xincheng to Zhuoxian, and Baigou River to Xinqiao. At 6:00 AM, all enemy strongholds and pillboxes within a hundred li between Zhuoxian and Gucheng were surrounded separately by our forces. At the same time, eight fortresses of various sizes, including Yaba River along the line, were captured. At 3:00 PM, our army, which captured Laishui, annihilated the 9th Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Provisional 31st Division of the enemy's New 2nd Army in the village of Bei'yian, east of Laishui, in fifteen minutes. At 3:00 AM on the 17th, we launched a fierce attack on Dingxing City, an important supply station for the enemy in the Pingbao sector, which was defended by the headquarters of the Provisional 31st Division of the New 2nd Army and the main force of its 1st and 2nd Regiments. The defending enemy was caught off guard under the heavy artillery bombardment of our forces. Our assault troops quickly rushed to the top of the city, and follow-up troops followed in a steady stream, quickly eliminating the headquarters of the Provisional 31st Division and its transport battalion. The remaining enemy was divided into three parts and annihilated separately. By 12:00 noon on the same day, the battle ended victoriously, capturing alive Chen Zhiping, Major General Commander of the 31st Division, and Lu Jiyun, Major General Deputy Commander, and more than 3,000 others. The defending enemy within the encirclement, having lost its command and supply center, became even more shaken. Therefore, on the morning of the 18th, we completely annihilated the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the 31st Division in Gucheng. On the same night, the headquarters of the 8th Regiment and most of its 1st and 3rd Battalions were annihilated in Gaobeidian. On the morning of the 19th, the headquarters of the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 31st Division and its 3rd Battalion were annihilated in Beihe Dian. On the morning of the 20th, our army launched another attack on the besieged Xushui County City in heavy rain. By 11:00 AM, the remaining 3rd Regiment of the Provisional 31st Division of the New 2nd Army was completely annihilated. At this point, our offensive came to a temporary halt.

After our army's offensive began, the bandit Fu hurriedly pieced together the 94th Army, the Provisional 3rd Army, etc., in an attempt to go south to rescue. On the 17th and 18th, they were forcefully blocked by our powerful troops in the area north of Zhuoxian, suffering more than 800 casualties. We also carried out continuous sabotage on the railway line from Changxindian to Zhuoxian, posing a serious threat to the enemy's rear. Until we liberated Xushui, the enemy was still blocked in Zhuoxian and the area north of it and could not advance.

From the start of the offensive at 00:00 on the 16th to the end of the battle at 11:00 on the 20th, in just four and a half days, we annihilated a total of more than 11,900 bandits from the entire Provisional 31st Division of the bandit's New 2nd Army and local reactionaries, liberating four county towns and controlling more than 200 li of the Baoding-Zhuoxian section of the railway. The so-called "Pingjin-Baoding triangular defense system" of the traitorous Fu army, which was already incomplete, was completely shattered, exposing the isolated Baoding "corner" and the Pingjin section of the Beining Railway to the full might of the People's Liberation Army.

    傅匪“平津保三角防御体系”
    被我完全打得支离破碎
    前线记者报导平保段战役经过
    【新华社平保前线三十一日电】前线记者报导平保段战役经过称：十六日零时，华北人民解放军强大野战兵团，在地方兵团配合下，横渡易水、拒马河，分路向保定、长辛店段三百余里国民党军走廊，发起全线攻势。十六日晨一时首克涞水城，并以六十里奔袭，一举解放王匪凤岗盘踞之新城县城，摧毁新城至高碑店、新城至涿县、白沟河至辛桥三条堡垒封锁线。晨六时，涿县固城间百余里所有敌点碉，全部为我分别包围。同时攻克沿线哑叭河等大小堡垒八座。下午三时，克涞水我军于涞水东之北义安村以十五分钟时间全歼该城逃敌新二军暂纲三十一师二团九营。十七日三时，我对平保段敌重要补给站，新二军暂编三十一师师部及一、二两团主力据守之定兴城，发动猛攻，守敌在我重炮轰击下，手足无措，我突击部队迅即冲上城头，后续部队亦源源跟着，当将暂编三十一师师部及其辎陆营首先解决，并将余敌割成三块，予以各个歼灭。至当日十二时战斗即胜利结束，活捉三十一师少将师长陈志平、少将副师长卢继云以下三千余人。包围圈内之各守敌以失去指挥供应中枢，更加动摇。我乃于十八日晨全歼整编三十一师一团三营于固城。同日晚歼守护第八团团部，及其一、三两营大部于高碑店。十九日晨歼暂三十一师一团团部及其三营于北河店。二十日上午，我军又冒大雨向被围之徐水县城发起攻击，至十一时全歼新二军暂三十一师仅余之第三团。至此我军攻势，暂告一段落。
    我军攻势开始后，傅匪曾慌忙拼凑九十四军、暂三军等企图南下援救，十七、十八两日，被我有力部队正面阻击于涿县以北地区，伤亡八百余人，我并于长辛店至涿县段铁路线上进行连续破袭，予敌后方严重威胁。直至我解放徐水时，该敌仍被阻于涿县及其以北地区未得前进。
    是役从十六日零时攻势开始，至二十日十一时战斗结束，仅四天半时间，我即共歼灭匪新二军暂编三十一师全部及土顽等一万一千九百余人，解放县城四座，控制保定涿县段铁路二百余里。把傅义匪军本来就已残缺不全的所谓“平、津、保三角防御体系”，完全打得支离破碎，使孤立起来的保定这一个“角”和北宁路平津段完全暴露在解放军的威力之下。
