[Taihang 27th Dispatch] The Taihang Second Military Sub-district's local armed forces, in coordination with the North China People's Liberation Army, have achieved significant results in the Jinzhong Campaign over the past month. Currently, the entire territory of the Second Military Sub-district is free of enemy traces. This campaign began on June 14th. On June 18th, our units destroyed more than ten li of the Tongpu Railway from Guocun to Wangxiang. On the nights of the 19th and 20th, a unit successively attacked enemy strongholds at Tianqiao and Beitianzhen within Yuci, killing and wounding over 20 enemies. The enemy at Tianqiao fled in disarray, and the village was immediately recovered by us. On the night of the 27th, a unit, with rapid action, captured the Huanggua enemy stronghold southeast of Taigu City within two hours, completely annihilating over 200 defending enemies, including the 9th Company, Transportation Company, and Mortar Company of the 2nd Regiment of the 9th Column of the bandit Yan's forces. On July 1st, the unit also captured Menggaocun, an important enemy stronghold on the Yuci-Taigu section of the Tongpu Railway, with the 9th Company and a mortar platoon of the 2nd Regiment of the 9th Column of the bandit Yan's forces mostly annihilated. On the morning of the 7th, the unit, in coordination with the field army, ambushed enemy reinforcements from Yuci, bravely repelling the attack of two battalions of the machine gun regiment of the bandit Yan's forces from Yuci. On the same day, they moved to the west of the Tongpu Railway, firmly holding a position about ten li west of Dongyangzhen (under Yuci) to block the bandit Yan's forces fleeing from Taigu and Xugou to Yuci. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th, when a part of the bandit Yan's Provisional 45th Division and two regiments of the 33rd Army, surrounded at Dachangzhen (under Xugou), were fleeing, they repelled more than ten enemy counterattacks, killing and wounding more than 580 enemies, completing the blocking task. On the 13th, the unit advanced to the Wangxiang area south of Yuci City, successively capturing the enemy strongholds of Nanyaozhen and Guocun. From the 13th to the 16th, they continuously annihilated bandit Yan's forces fleeing north from the Dachangzhen area of Xugou, capturing over 500 enemies alive. On the 17th, the unit braved the rain and advanced to the Wangcun and Jincheng areas on the outskirts of Yuci City, besieging Yuci City. On the night of the 16th, the defending 8th Column Security 7th Regiment abandoned the city in panic and fled towards Taiyuan, and the city was liberated by us. At the same time, the Beihelou Station on the Zhengtai Railway and the important enemy stronghold of Yuanwozhen were also captured by us. In total, during the month-long offensive, our local armed forces, in coordination with the North China People's Liberation Army, successively liberated Yuci City and 63 strongholds, 8 stations, and 215 villages and towns. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 672 bandit Yan's forces were killed or wounded, and 717 enemies were captured, including over 60 Japanese. A total of 1,389 enemies were annihilated. The captured materials included one mortar, 14 small cannons, 11 heavy machine guns, 53 light machine guns, 445 rifles and carbines, 6 pistols, over 10,000 rounds of ammunition, over 100 shells, 500 hand grenades, and 77 bombs.
