    Central Hebei Telegram: The wheat harvest in various parts of central Hebei this year is quite good. According to statistics from 333 villages in eight, nine, and eleven districts and six counties in the tenth district, there are 6,182,926 mu of wheat fields, accounting for more than 20 percent of the total cultivated land area (24,839,985 mu). In particular, counties in the eighth district account for more than 32 percent. This year, wheat production in general areas has increased compared to last year; in some areas, the harvest is around 70 percent. For example, in counties such as Jianguo, Hejian, and Renhe in the eighth district, the average wheat yield per mu last year was 63 jin (equivalent to 4.2 market dou), while this year it is 65 to 70 jin. Counties such as Xinle, Gaoyang, and Wuji in the ninth district also had a good harvest of over 70 percent, with an average wheat yield of 92 jin (equivalent to 6 market dou) per mu. In Raoyang, Anxin, Qingyuan, and some villages in Xinle, the yield reached over 130 jin (equivalent to 8.71 market dou) per mu. In two districts of Xinle, with 32 villages and a total of 110,145 mu of cultivated land, including over 22,300 mu of irrigated land, the average wheat yield per mu was 7 dou. In Xiangcheng village, the average reached 8.2 dou per mu. In Gaoyang, the better-yielding areas reached 7.33 market dou, and the general areas reached 6.9 market dou. The counties in the eleventh district also averaged 79 jin (5 market dou). After the farmers in various places put the new wheat into storage, they were all filled with joy and actively delivered wheat for public grain to support the front lines. As of July 15th, ten counties and cities, including Suning, Lixian, Anguo, and Xinji, had completed the wheat season collection. Six counties, including Shenxian, Luancheng, and Qingxian, had also completed 50 to 90 percent. The masses in the border areas of Qingyuan and Anxin delivered public grain as they threshed, stored, and delivered, showing high enthusiasm. When delivering public grain, many people specially selected good wheat, fanned it with a winnowing machine, and cleaned it with a dustpan before delivering it.
