    Unprecedented Great Unity of American Democratic Forces
    The "Two-Party System" That Fools the People Is Broken

    The establishment of the American Progressive Party is a major victory for American democratic forces in their struggle for peace and democracy. The Progressive Party's first national convention was grandly held in Philadelphia from July 23rd to 25th. Although the American reactionaries had previously launched a shameful propaganda campaign to slander the new party, the vigorous and enthusiastic atmosphere of the convention overshadowed the meetings of the two reactionary old parties, the Republican and Democratic parties, which had been held in the same venue not long before. On the first day of the convention, including delegates, there were 10,000 participants; the evening rally at Shibei Park on the second day attracted as many as 35,000 people. Passionate speeches and thunderous applause turned the meeting into a powerful indictment and demonstration against the American reactionaries. During the three-day convention, the delegates approved a party constitution that welcomed the full participation of all anti-monopoly capital, anti-war, and anti-fascist individuals; nominated Wallace and Taylor as presidential and vice-presidential candidates; adopted a platform aimed at achieving a peaceful foreign policy (including demanding an end to financial and military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship and demanding sincere peace talks with the Soviet Union), free people's rights, and a prosperous social economy; and elected a national committee headed by former Minnesota Governor Benson and Black leader Robeson. From now on, it will be difficult for the two major old parties in the United States—the Republican and Democratic parties—to deceive the people with deception, bribery, and fabrication as easily as in the past. The so-called "two-party system" that they have used for many years to manipulate American elections, that is, only candidates from two parties compete, thereby forcing the people to choose between two evils, has been broken.

    Moreover, the more significant meaning of the establishment of the Progressive Party lies in the fact that it is a mass party of the broadest united front including all strata that oppose monopoly capital. This is a great unity of democratic forces that has never appeared in American history. The American people's struggle for peace, freedom, and democracy in the future will surely gain a broader mass base, and will be more organized and more powerful. Immediately following the Progressive Party Congress, a youth conference attended by more than 2,000 youth representatives from industry, agriculture, and academia across the country was held in Philadelphia on July 26. The conference decided to establish the American Progressive Youth League and passed resolutions supporting the Progressive Party platform and demanding an end to the persecution of leaders of the American Communist Party. The League will play an active role in uniting and educating American youth and in carrying out the Progressive Party's campaign work among young people.

    美国民主力量空前大团结
    愚弄人民的“两党制度”被打破
    美国进步党已告成立，这是美国民主势力在争取和平民主斗争中的一个重大胜利。进步党第一次全国代表大会，于七月二十三至二十五日在费城隆重举行。大会到有全国各州代表三千名。虽然美国反动派事先曾发动诬蔑新党运动的可耻宣传，但大会会场的蓬勃热烈，使前此不久在此同一会场举行的共和与民主两个反动老党的会议为之黯然失色。大会第一日参加者连同代表在内，共达万人；第二日的席比公园晚会，参加者竟达三万五千人。激昂的演说和雷动的掌声，使会议变成了对美国反动派的有力控诉和示威。大会在三天会议中，通过了欢迎一切反独占资本、反战、反法西斯人士充分参加的党章；推举了华莱士与泰勒为正副总统候选人；通过了旨在实现和平外交政策（其中包括要求停止对蒋介石独裁政权的财政与军事援助，要求与苏联举行诚意的和平谈判）、自由人民权利与富足社会经济的政纲；选举了以前明尼苏达州州长宾生、黑人领袖罗伯逊等为首的全国委员会。从此以后，美国两大老党——共和党与民主党要想象过去那样容易地以欺骗、贿赂、捏造来愚弄人民是困难了。他们多年来借以操纵美国选举的所谓“两党制度”，即只有两党候选人竞选，从而强迫人民在两害之中取其一的制度，是被打破了。
    不仅如此，进步党成立的更重大的意义，在于它是最广泛地包括了反独占资本的各阶层的统一战线的群众性的党，这是美国历史上从未出现过的民主力量的大团结。美国人民今后争取和平、自由、民主的斗争，必将获得更广泛的群众基础，而且会更加有组织，更加有力量。紧接进步党大会之后，由全国工、农、学各界青年代表二千余名参加的青年大会，又于七月二十六日在费城举行，大会决定创设美国进步青年团，并通过拥护进步党政纲，要求停止迫害美共领袖等决议。该团将在团结与教育美国青年方面，在展开进步党在青年中的竞选工作上，起着积极的作用。
