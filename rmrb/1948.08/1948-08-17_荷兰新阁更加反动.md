　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Reports from various sources: The more reactionary new Dutch cabinet, after a month of twists and turns, was finally formed on the 6th of this month. The new cabinet includes six members of the Catholic Party, five members of the Socialist Party, and one member each from the Liberal Party, the Christian Historical Party, and so-called non-partisans. It is headed by Prime Minister Drees. The Dutch Communist Party's organ, "De Waarheid," emphasized that this is a cabinet that "will only bring disaster to the Dutch nation and lead to the loss of national independence." It was formed under the pressure of American imperialism, and "its composition is sufficient to guarantee that the government will oppose the Soviet Union at any time." "De Waarheid" analyzed the figures in the new government, saying that the ministers of the new government, especially Foreign Minister Stikker, have been proven by facts to be a "loyal defender" of the so-called "American ideals." Prime Minister Drees (Socialist Party) served as Minister of Social Affairs in the previous two cabinets and is an enthusiastic supporter of the "police action" against Indonesia, as well as someone who openly attacks the living standards of the Dutch working class. Overseas Minister Hassen is the "special envoy of the Vatican." Deputy Prime Minister Schaik (non-partisan) has close ties with American monopoly capital. Social Affairs Minister Joekes has held important positions in several colonial companies. Interior Minister Maarschalkveen illegally released a large number of fascists. According to the Dutch parliamentary elections held on the 7th of last month, the Catholic Party won 32 seats out of 100, the Socialist Party 27 seats, the Anti-Revolutionary Party 13 seats, and the Communist Party, despite various acts of terror, sabotage, and obstruction by the reactionary government, still won 8 seats (originally 10 seats). After the election, the old cabinet resigned as usual.

　　荷兰新阁更加反动
    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方报导：更反动的荷兰新内阁经过一整月时间之周折以后，已于本月六日最后组成。新阁共包括天主教党六人，社会党五人，自由党、基督教历史党及所谓无党派者各一人。由德利斯任总理。荷共机关报“德瓦尔海报”强调指出这是一个“只会给荷兰民族带来灾害并导致国家独立的丧失”的内阁。它是在美帝国主义压力下组成的，“它的成份足以保证该政府随时反对苏联”。“德瓦尔海报”分析新政府人物称，新政府的部长们，特别是外交部长斯蒂克已，被事实证明是一位所谓“美国理想”的“忠诚保卫者”。总理德利斯（社会党）曾历任前两届内阁的社会部长，是一个对印尼采取“警察行动”的热心支持者，同时也是明目张胆地向荷兰工人阶级的生活水平进攻的人。海外部长哈森是“梵蒂冈的特别总差”。副总理谢克（无党派）与美国独占资本有密切联系。社会部长若克斯曾在若干殖民公司中历任要职。内政部长马尔西文曾违法释放大批法西斯分子。按荷兰议会选举于上月七日举行，选举结果，天主教党在一百席中得三十二席，社会党二十七席，反革命党十三席，共产党在反动政府种种恐怖，破坏，与阻挠之下，仍然得到了八席（原为十席）。选举结束后，旧内阁即按例辞职。
