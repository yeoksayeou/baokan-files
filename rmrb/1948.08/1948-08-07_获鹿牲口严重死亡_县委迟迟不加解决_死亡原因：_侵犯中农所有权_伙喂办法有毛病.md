    Huolu County Livestock Suffering Serious Deaths
    County Committee Fails to Resolve Issue Promptly
    Reasons for Death:
    Violation of Middle Peasant Ownership
    Communal Feeding Methods Flawed

    [This newspaper dispatch] According to reports from the General Branch reporter: Since March of this year, Huolu County has experienced a significant number of livestock deaths, the vast majority being "victory livestock" (果实牲口, livestock gained as fruits of land reform). In the Sixth District alone, 61 mules, 58 donkeys, 10 cattle, and 1 horse have died. It is estimated that the total number of livestock deaths in the county is at least 200. Considering each head of livestock can cultivate 50 mu of land, the loss of animal power represents 100 hectares of land. This has a significant impact on production. The reporter visited several villages and found that the main reasons for livestock deaths were largely due to the "victory livestock" not being distributed in a timely manner, being centrally fed and poorly managed, or the forced organization of middle peasants' livestock into mutual aid groups with poor peasants without equal exchange, resulting in overwork and death.

    In Xiaoyudi Village, Sixth District, after land was distributed in March, the work team subjectively organized 28 large mutual aid groups in the village, each group cultivating more than one hectare of land, comprising members from all social strata. The large groups were further divided into smaller groups (varying from three to five households), distributing and sharing the members' livestock and waterwheels equally. Initially, it was said that labor and animal power would be exchanged, with poor peasants working for middle peasants, and middle peasants letting poor peasants use their livestock. After the organization, some poor peasants took the livestock of middle peasants without their permission, using them and returning them without feeding them. Some middle peasants did not lack labor or animal power, and did not need or rarely needed poor peasants to work. Some middle peasants had their own work to do and were unwilling to let others use their livestock, so some poor peasants said, "We are in the same group, if you don't let us use them, we'll see you at the poor peasant association." Hao Buxi, a middle peasant who rented and cultivated a total of more than 40 mu of land and raised two mules, had his land and mules incorporated into the group, and the mules were worked to death. Hao Zhilun, a middle peasant with a family of ten, cultivated more than 20 mu of land. Because his group had many livestock, one of his mules was transferred to another large group. This livestock was originally very strong, but after more than ten days of use, it was on the verge of death and had to be treated with five or six doses of medicine before it recovered. The production organization in this village was not disbanded until around April 10th by the district, and by that time, three livestock had already died.

    In Beiqie Village (360 households) in the Sixth District, livestock was distributed according to the method of "filling the poor pit," based on the amount of land. Each mule was calculated to cultivate 50 mu of land, and only five or more households could share a mule. Some of these small groups sharing livestock were not voluntarily formed. After obtaining the livestock, each household determined the number of days of use and feeding based on the amount of land they owned. Feeding the livestock one day required two sheng (a unit of dry volume) of grain and 15 jin (a unit of weight) of grass, which became unaffordable over time, and the livestock were not well-fed. Each household accumulated a lot of work (even tasks that people could handle were left for the livestock), and the livestock did not get enough rest. This year, due to the drought, the livestock pulled waterwheels day and night, and soon they were worn out. The households blamed each other, wanting to sell them or exchange them for smaller livestock, but the leadership did not allow it. As a result, ten livestock died in this village due to both overwork and starvation.

    In Dongguan, in the urban area, there were nine "victory livestock" which were fed by hired laborers employed by the farmers' association. Due to poor care, four died and one was stolen. The Caozhuang Farmers' Association hired three people specifically to feed the livestock, paying each person 60 jin of rice per month. As time went on, the farmers' association gradually became unable to afford it. The "victory livestock" in Nanguan were not distributed and were fed by the masses (mostly small merchants) who took turns going to the farmers' association to feed them. The farmers' association bought fodder, but despite using a lot of fodder, the livestock were fed poorly and became weak. Fang Village, in the Sixth District, is a market town with more than 400 households. The merchants were allocated livestock but did not know how to care for them, resulting in the deaths of ten mules and five donkeys. Many merchants in Hongshan, in the Third District, were unwilling to accept livestock. Having been allocated them, they naturally would not feed them well, and two have already died.

    In Shiqiao Village, three households shared a mule and two households shared a donkey. Initially, they were freely organized and happy to share. However, as time went on, disagreements arose: "You say I use it more, I say you feed it less." Those not in the groups also borrowed them arbitrarily. The households that obtained livestock felt that since these were "victory livestock," they couldn't refuse others to use them. Gradually, friction arose. It is said that three livestock have already been worked to death or starved to death in this village. In Zhaobukou Village, Sixth District, three households shared one livestock, and they mistakenly believed that "the livestock was obtained for free, so it doesn't matter if it dies," resulting in people using it but no one feeding it. In one instance, three households shared a mule, and one of the households took the mule to the well to pull a waterwheel all night. The next morning, they fed it a few handfuls of grass and harnessed it to pull the waterwheel again until noon. The other two households also competed to use it.

    The county leadership did not promptly discover this serious phenomenon of livestock deaths, and even after discovering it, they did not pay attention to it or take immediate steps to correct it. According to Comrade Hao Laohai, the director of the County Farmers' Association, this phenomenon was already discovered during the wheat harvest, and he suggested to Comrade Cao, the County Party Secretary, to find a way to rectify and resolve it. However, Comrade Cao believed at the time that "this is unavoidable" and did not pay much attention to it, delaying until late July, when the number of livestock deaths in the Sixth District increased to 132, before the county realized the seriousness of the problem. Remedial measures were formulated, stipulating that "victory livestock" that could not be afforded could be sold and the proceeds distributed, or exchanged for smaller livestock and raised separately, or the livestock could be sold to one household in the group for raising.

    Editor's Note: This kind of slow-moving work style is extremely harmful to the people's cause and we hope that attention will be paid to overcoming it. This phenomenon is not only present in Huolu, but seems to be quite common based on reports from various places. We hope that the leadership of all counties and districts should immediately conduct a widespread and thorough inspection, overcome this erroneous thinking, resolutely correct the "leftist" tendencies of forced mutual aid, infringing on the ownership and right to use the livestock of middle peasants, and truly establish mutual aid groups on the principles of voluntarism and equal value. It is best to distribute "victory livestock" in a fair and reasonable manner, so that ownership truly belongs to individuals. Several households sharing livestock should only be implemented when they voluntarily agree to share them; otherwise, it will be detrimental to production.

    获鹿牲口严重死亡
    县委迟迟不加解决
    死亡原因：
    侵犯中农所有权
    伙喂办法有毛病
    【本报讯】总分社记者报导：获鹿县自今年三月以来，死亡牲口很多，其中绝大部分是果实牲口。仅六区即死骡子六十一头，驴五十八头，牛十头，马一匹。据估计全县牲口死亡数至少在二百头以上。以每头牲口种地五十亩计，有一百顷地的畜力丧失了。这对生产的影响是很大的。记者访问了几个村庄，发现牲口死亡的主要原因，大多是果实牲口没有及时分配，集中伙喂，管理不好死了，有的是强制中农的牲口与贫农共组互助组，没有等价交换，光使不喂，因而累死。
    六区小于底村于三月间分完了地，工作组即主观的在全村组织了二十八个大互助组，每组合一顷多地，组内各阶层都有。大组内又分若干小组（三五户不等），把组员的牲口水车平均分配公用。开始讲的是人力与畜力变工，贫农给中农做活，中农叫贫农使牲口。组织好了，有些贫农不经中农允许就把他的牲口牵走，使完了不喂即送回去。这些中农人畜力均不缺乏，用不着或很少用着贫农干活。有的中农自己有活，不愿叫别人使牲口，有的贫农就说：“咱们是一个组，不叫使，到贫农团见”。中农郝不喜连租种地共四十余亩，喂两个骡子，他的地与骡子编到组里，骡子都累死了。中农郝志伦十口人，种廿多亩地。他组里牲口多，就把他一头骡拨到别的大组里去，这个牲口原很壮实，十余天后牲口使的要死了，吃了五六付药才治好。该村生产组织至四月十号左右才经区上解散，至此已死了三个牲口。
    六区北郄马村（三六○户），分牲口时按填穷坑方式，根据地亩分，每个骡子合计种五十亩地，五户以上才能伙分一头骡子。这些伙分牲口的小组有些不是自愿结合的。分得牲口后，各户按地多少决定使用与喂养天数。喂一天用二升料十五斤草，日久喂不起，牲口吃不饱。各户均积活很多（人能办的事也给牲口留着），牲口得不到休息，今年天旱，牲口不分昼夜的拉水车，不久牲口就使坏了。各户互相埋怨，想卖了或换成小牲口，领导上又不许可，该村牲口就这样连累带饿死了十头。
    城区东关有九个果实牲口，由农会雇长工喂着，因照顾不好死了四头，被偷走一头。曹庄农会雇了三个人专门喂牲口，每月每人六十斤米，日子一长，农会渐渐负担不起了。南关果实牲口没分，由群众（小商人多）轮流到农会去喂，农会买草料。草料用的也不少，牲口却喂的瘦弱不堪。六区方村是个集镇，有四百多户，商贩分了牲口，不会照顾，死了十头骡子五头驴。三区红山的商贩多不愿要牲口，分了后自然不会很好的喂养，已死了两个。
    石桥村三户分一头骡子，两户分一头驴，开始是自由结组分的，大家很高兴。后来时间长了，“你说我使的多，我说你喂的草料少”，不在组的也任意借用。得牲口户认为这是果实牲口，不同自己买的，不让人家使不合适。慢慢的闹起蹩扭来。据说该村已累饿死了三头牲口。六区赵卜口村，三户分了一个牲口，他们错认为“牲口是白手得来的，死了拉倒”，于是有人使没人喂。有三户分了骡子一头，其中一户把骡子牵到井上拉了一夜水车，第二天清早喂了几把草，又套上拉到响午。其他两户也争着使。
    对于这种死亡牲口的严重现象，该县领导上并未及时发现，以后发现了也未引起注意，立予纠正。据县农会主任郝老海同志谈：麦收时已发现这种现象，曾向县委书记曹同志建议设法纠正解决，但曹同志当时认为“这是免不了的”，没有十分注意，一直拖延到七月下旬，六区死亡牲口增加到一三二头的时候，县里才认识到这个问题的严重性。订出挽救的办法，规定喂养不起的果实牲口，可以变卖分款，或换成小牲口分养，或将牲口卖给本组一户喂养。（光明、杨青）                
    编者按：这种迟缓的作风，是十分有害于人民事业的，望能注意加以克服。这种现象不仅获鹿有，据各地来稿看，似乎带有相当的普遍性，我们希望各县区领导上应立即进行普遍深入的检查，克服这种错误思想，坚决纠正强迫互助、侵犯中农牲口所有权与使用权的左倾偏向，把互助组真正树立在自愿等价的原则上。果实牲口最好以公平合理的办法分配下去，使主权真正归于个人。若干户伙喂牲口，只能在他们自愿伙喂时实行；否则对生产有害无益。
