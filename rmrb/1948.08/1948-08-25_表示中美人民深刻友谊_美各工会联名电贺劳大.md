　　Expressing Profound Friendship Between Chinese and American People
  　US Labor Unions Jointly Congratulate Labor Congress
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 23rd】American labor unions have jointly sent a congratulatory telegram to the Sixth National Labor Congress of China. This congratulation was initiated by the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy. The original text of the congratulatory message is as follows:

    Greetings to the Chinese Workers' Congress!

    We, American trade unionists—members of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and independent trade unions, firmly believe that a free and democratic labor movement in every country is indispensable for the struggle for democracy, prosperity, and peace. Therefore, when we learned that Chiang Kai-shek, after expelling some genuine labor movement leaders who opposed his dictatorial policies, established a Hitler-style "Labor Front" on April 18th this year, we were deeply shocked.

    In response to this shameless act by Chiang Kai-shek, Zhu Xuefan, the world-renowned Chinese labor leader, Chairman of the China Labor Association, and Vice President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Unions of the Liberated Areas of China and Executive Committee Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, decided to convene a unified "National Congress of Workers' Representatives" in Harbin on June 10th this year (later postponed to August 1st due to the non-arrival of representatives from various regions).

    As this conference convenes, we extend our warm greetings to our Chinese brothers and sisters in the labor movement. We congratulate and support your great National Congress of Workers' Representatives.

    We do this to express the traditional deep friendship of the American people towards the Chinese people. We are even more eager to do this because our government, for the benefit of a very few selfish groups, has adopted a policy of intervention, helping the Chinese reactionaries, and prolonging the suffering and disaster of the Chinese people.

    The corruption of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship has forced the American Pioneer Forum to publicly state on August 26th of last year: "To maintain Chiang Kai-shek's rule in the long term against the wishes of the 450 million Chinese people, countless billions of US dollars must be spent." And this dictatorial government has already received 5 billion US dollars in US aid since the Japanese surrender. This is the Chiang Kai-shek who suppresses all genuine labor movements in the KMT-controlled areas, replacing them with a typical fascist "Labor Front."

    This Chiang Kai-shek government, in August 1946, took over the trade union building built with donations from the CIO and AFL in America and expelled the legitimate leaders of the China Labor Association.

    Secret agents carry out terrorist acts against trade union leaders, systematically sabotage strikes, and in February of this year even used tanks and tear gas to suppress the heroic strike of workers (most of whom were female) at the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Factory.

    Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, appealed to American workers: "The survival of labor is in danger, free and democratic labor movements are being attacked everywhere, free groups are being destroyed, and democratic leaders are constantly in danger of their lives." He also said: "We Chinese trade unionists oppose the US government's interference in China's internal affairs."

    We American trade unionists are engaged in an extremely sharp struggle. American capitalists, emboldened by unprecedentedly high profits of 18 billion US dollars in the past six months, are now attacking living standards, trade union organizations, and the rights of the people. Prices are rising daily, but they refuse to increase wages. We firmly believe that those who use the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill to shackle American labor are also detrimental to all working people in other countries.

    The current US policy of aiding reactionary forces in China is part of the US warmongering foreign policy. This policy does not build houses or produce daily necessities for the people, but instead manufactures military supplies for civil wars and conflicts in other countries. It can only bring new enslavement to China, and for American workers, it means soaring living costs today and the threat of war tomorrow.

    In November 1946, the CIO National Congress passed a resolution demanding an end to interference in China's internal affairs. We agree with this attitude, and we assure our Chinese brothers and sisters in the labor movement that we will call on all organized workers in America, and we will also call on all the American people, to demand that our government stop interfering in the Chinese civil war.

    We are extremely willing to help the Chinese people engage in construction and strive for peace. This can only be achieved after the Chinese people win a truly democratic government.

    Finally, in the spirit of deep friendship between the two peoples, we extend our warm greetings to you! We congratulate the success of the National Congress of Workers' Representatives, a milestone in the struggle for freedom, democracy, and peace in China!

### 表示中美人民深刻友谊　美各工会联名电贺劳大

　　表示中美人民深刻友谊
  　美各工会联名电贺劳大
    【新华社东北二十三日电】美国各职工会联名电贺中国第六次劳动大会。这一祝贺，系由美国远东民主政策委员会所发起。贺电原文如下：
    向中国职工代表大会致敬！
    我们美国职工运动者——美国产业职工联合会、美国劳工联合会所属和独立的职工会的会员们，深信在每一个国家内、一个自由民主的职工运动，对争取民主富裕及和平是不可缺少的。因此当我们得悉蒋介石把一些反对其独裁政策的真正职工运动领袖驱逐出国之后，竟于今年四月十八日建立希特勒式的“劳动阵线”时，我们为之十分震惊。
    世界公认的中国工运领袖、中国劳动协会理事长兼世界职工联合会副主席朱学范先生及中国解放区职工联合会筹备委员会主席兼世界职工联合会执委刘宁一先生，为了回答蒋介石这一无耻行为，定于今年六月十日（按后因各地代表未到达而延于八月一日召开）在哈尔滨召开统一的“全国职工代表大会”。
    当此大会召开之际，我们热忱地向中国兄弟职工运动者致敬，我们祝贺并且拥护你们伟大的全国职工代表大会。
    我们这样做，是为了表示美国人民对中国人民传统的深厚友谊；我们更迫切地要这样做，是因为我们的政府为了极少数自私集团的利益，竟采取干涉政策，帮助中国反动派，延长了中国人民的痛苦及灾难。
    蒋介石独裁的腐败，已不得不使美国先驱论坛报在去年八月二十六日公开说：“要违反中国四万万五千万人民的愿望，长期维持蒋介石的统治，必须花费无数万万美金。”而这个独裁政府自日本投降已经得到了五十万万美金的美援。这就是那个蒋介石，他压迫了蒋管区一切真正工运，代之以典型的法西斯“劳动阵线”。
    这个蒋介石政府一九四六年八月，接收了由美国产联、劳联捐款所建筑的工会大楼，并驱逐了劳协合法领袖。
    特务向工会领袖施行恐怖行为，有计划的破坏罢工，在今年二月间竟使用坦克及催泪毒气，摧残上海申新纱厂英勇罢工的工人（其中大部份为女工）。
    中国劳协理事长朱学范先生，曾向美国工人呼吁：“劳工的生存在危险中，自由民主的工运到处受到打击，自由集团受到破坏，民主领袖时刻有生命之虞。”他又说：“我们中国职工运动者，反对美国政府干涉中国内政。”
    我们美国职工运动者，正从事极端的尖锐的斗争。美国大资本家，由于去年半年中获得一百八十万万的空前高度利润而威风凛凛起来，现在正向生活水准，工会组织及人民权利进攻。物价日益高涨，但他们却拒绝增加工资。我们深信：用塔夫脱、哈特莱反劳工法案束缚美国劳工的人、对其他国家之一切劳动人民也是不利的。
    目前美国援助中国反动势力的政策，是美国好战外交政策的一部分。这个政策，不为人民建筑房屋、生产日用品，却为别国的内战和冲突制造军火。它只能带给中国新的奴役，对美国工人来说，它意味着今天的生活费飞涨和明天的战争威胁。
    一九四六年十一月，美国产联全国大会通过决议，要求停止干涉中国内政，我们同意这一态度，我们向中国兄弟职工运动者保证：我们要号召美国一切有组织的工人，我们也要号召全美国人民，要求我们政府停止干涉中国内战。
    我们极愿帮助中国人民从事建设，争取和平；这只有在中国人民赢得一个真正民主政府后才能做到。
    最后，我们以两国人民深刻友谊的精神，向你们热烈的致敬！祝贺中国自由民主和平胜利斗争的里程碑——全国职工代表大会成功！
