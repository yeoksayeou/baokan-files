　　The Most Glorious Post is on the Front Lines!
    Northwest Central Bureau Directs:
  　Do a Good Job of Returning to the Ranks
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, August 8th] The Northwest Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party issued a directive on June 15th regarding launching a "Return to the Ranks" movement, calling on the entire party and army to do a good job in returning to the ranks, in order to consolidate and strengthen the field army, and strive for greater victories in the war. The directive first pointed out: In the past, some local troops have taken in deserters from the field army as soldiers; some local party and government workers have adopted a laissez-faire, conniving, or promoting and retaining approach towards soldiers and cadres who desert or are on leave for extended periods, in order to fill their own work departments; or they do not mobilize cadres returning home from the front to return to the ranks, but instead send them to schools to study; these are all erroneous practices that support backward thinking and corrode revolutionary sentiment. Party and government organs, local military groups, and guerrilla units at all levels and in all regions must earnestly examine and resolutely correct this. All soldiers and cadres who were mobilized to join the army last year, who have deserted or been on leave for extended periods, regardless of whether they are currently holding other positions, must all be mobilized to return to the ranks. Cadres who have left the army and returned to local posts should first respond to the Party's call: "The most glorious post for a Communist Party member is on the front lines," lead by example, and lead the personnel who have left the army to return to the ranks. In the future, party and government organs, local military groups, and guerrilla units that continue to harbor or employ field army deserters will be subject to due punishment.
    The directive then proposed to launch a broad mass "Return to the Ranks" movement. This movement should implement the following correct working methods: (1) Each district and township should organize two groups of cadres and masses to lead the return to the ranks, conduct detailed investigations of personnel who should return to the ranks, analyze the reasons for their return home, and study solutions. (2) Take the township or village as a unit, convene meetings attended by personnel who should return to the ranks and some of the masses, explaining that in order to permanently consolidate the border areas, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the enemy, that "deserting" is shameful, that returning to the ranks is glorious, and guaranteeing that there will be no punishment after returning to the ranks. Mobilize cadres and party members to first persuade their children to gloriously return to the ranks, then coordinate with individual visits and mass persuasion, targeting specific individuals to overcome various backward thoughts. (3) For families of soldiers returning to the ranks who lack labor and have real difficulties in life, they should coordinate with production and disaster relief movements to effectively solve the problem of overcoming famine, and launch mass democratic discussions to reasonably improve the system of preferential treatment for military dependents, in order to reduce the concerns of soldiers on the front lines about their families. (4) Mobilize party members, cadres and activists among the personnel returning to the ranks to play a leading role, concentrate them in a timely manner, and provide them with enthusiastic care from the district and township governments, and welcome and comfort them with mass farewells, encouraging soldiers returning to the ranks to actively set out and send them to the front lines. (5) All bad work styles such as deception, abuse, and coercion must be resolutely abolished and not allowed to be committed again.
    The directive also stipulates that during the "Return to the Ranks" movement, the field army should launch the writing of letters to soldiers and cadres who have deserted or been on leave for extended periods, report the good news of combat life and victories, and persuade them to return to the ranks voluntarily. A welcoming attitude should be adopted towards soldiers returning to the ranks, and they should be actively enlightened politically to raise their ideological awareness. Those who return to the ranks voluntarily and those who make progress after returning to the ranks should be commended. It is also necessary to discover shortcomings in the work from understanding the ideological sentiments of the deserters, and earnestly study improvements. Only in this way can we consolidate the troops and eliminate the phenomenon of desertion. Some units have had incidents of mistreating deserters, capturing deserters, and even beating people to death. These do not conform to the spirit of treating illnesses and saving people, and must be seriously reviewed and resolutely corrected.
    The directive finally pointed out: The work of returning to the ranks is the natural responsibility of local party and government, and the local party and government should bear full responsibility. The troops are only responsible for sending people to receive them. Personnel from various troops who have been sent to various places to do the work of returning to the ranks should participate in this work under the unified leadership of the local prefectural committees and county committees. After the completion of this "Return to the Ranks" movement, the local party and government should establish a system for regularly responsible for the work of returning to the ranks. Whenever someone escapes, the local party and government have the responsibility to report and urge the person to return to the ranks, otherwise it will be treated as dereliction of duty.

　　最光荣的岗位在前线！
    西北中央局指示
  　做好归队工作
    【新华社西北八日电】中共西北中央局六月十五日发出关于开展归队运动的指示，号召全党全军做好归队工作，以巩固和加强野战军，争取战争的更大的胜利。指示首先指出：过去有些地方部队收容野战军逃兵作战士；有些地方党政工作人员对逃跑或久假不归的战士、干部采取放任、包庇或升级留用，以充实自己工作部门；或对前方回家干部不动员归队，又送学校学习；这些都是扶助落后思想，腐蚀革命情绪的错误做法。各级和各地党政机关、地方兵团和游击队，必须认真检查，坚决纠正。凡去年动员参军的战士、干部，逃跑或久假不归的，不论现在有无担任其他工作，一律全部动员归队。离队后回地方任职的干部，应首先响应党的号召：“共产党员最光荣的岗位在前线”，以身作则，带领离队人员归队。今后党政机关、地方兵团、游击队如有继续包庇或收用野战军死亡人员者，须受到应得处分。
    指示继提出要开展一个广泛群众性的归队运动，这一运动应贯彻以下各项正确的工作方法：（一）每区每乡组织好二批领导归队的干部和群众，详细调查应归队人员，分析他们回家原因，研究出解决办法。（二）以乡或村为单位，召开应归队人员和若干群众参加的会议，说明边区要永久巩固，必须彻底消灭敌人，“开小差”是可耻的，归队是光荣的，保证归队后不受处分，发动干部、党员首先劝说自己子弟光荣归队，再配合个别访问，群众劝说，针对具体对象，克服各种落后思想，（三）归队战士家庭缺乏劳动力、生活确实困难者，应配合生产救灾运动，切实解决渡过灾荒，并发动群众民主讨论，合理改进优待军属制度，以减少前方战士对家庭的顾虑。（四）发动归队人员中的党员干部积极分子起带头作用，适时集中，由区乡政府热情照顾，群众欢送慰问，鼓励归队战士踊跃起程，送往前方。（五）一切欺骗虐待、强迫命令等恶劣作风，必须坚决废止，不许再犯。
    指示又规定：野战军在归队运动期间，应发动给逃跑或久假不归的战士干部写信，报导战斗生活胜利消息，劝说其自动归队。对归队战士应采取欢迎态度，积极从政治上启发其觉悟，提高其思想认识，对自动归队及归队后有进步的，要加以表扬。还要从了解逃亡人员的思想情绪中，发现工作中的缺点，切实研究改进。只有这样才能做到巩固部队，消灭逃亡现象。某些部分曾发生过虐待逃亡人员，捕捉逃兵，甚至打死人的事件，这些都不符合治病救人的精神，必须认真的加以检讨，坚决纠正。
    指示最后指出：归队工作是地方党政的当然职责，应由地方党政负完全责任，部队只管派人接收，各部队已派往各地做归队工作的人员，应在地委县委统一领导下参加此项工作。此次归队运动完成后，各地党政应建立经常负责归队工作的制度，凡有一人逃回者，地方党政即有报告和督劝本人归队的责任，否则即以渎职论处。
