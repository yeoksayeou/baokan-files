[Taiyue Telegram] In Siyuan Village, Qinyuan County, women have participated in agricultural labor and have a habit of mutual assistance. This year, after changing large-scale mutual aid to small-scale mutual aid, more women participated in mutual assistance and labor exchange. The mutual aid team led by Hou Jiayuan and Wen Fulan is the best. The entire team of thirteen people has done 229 workdays from sowing to now, of which 58 were done for people outside the group, earning 2 shi, 5 dou, and 3 sheng of millet. At the beginning of spring plowing, all fifteen male laborers in the village went out to participate in the war, leaving only five old men at home. Wen Fulan and others helped each other to go to the fields, replacing the men, doing everything from feeding cattle, chopping grass, carrying water, and delivering manure to harvesting, plowing, and sowing. In one spring, they delivered manure to more than 50 mu of land. During the wheat harvest, the entire team used a total of 70 workdays, of which women accounted for 40. When pulling corn seedlings, the women completely pulled out all 134 mu of the team's land. In addition to voluntary association in mutual aid and labor exchange, there are many aspects that meet the needs of women: First, whether it is labor exchange or selling labor, it is allocated according to the work, and points are recorded according to the work. Weeding seedlings is recorded by the row and by the line, which is convenient for those who have to arrive late and leave early due to taking care of children and cooking, truly achieving one point for one work, one point for one exchange, and no one suffers a loss. Second, the wage distribution is fair and reasonable. For example, when distributing wages for pulling corn, there were 50 yuan left, which could not be divided, so they bought a box of matches and divided it among everyone. Third, reasonable care and problem solving. Eleven pairs of military shoes were distributed during the spring plowing season, and the children of eleven women were vaccinated against cowpox. If a woman was sick, Wen Fulan would discuss with everyone that she would not be assigned to work this time and would work later. Everyone agreed after discussion, which took care of everyone's actual difficulties, and everyone was happy. Fourth, in addition to spending part of the wages earned by women on necessities such as buying hairpins, needles, and shoe face cloth, they set aside a portion to buy things for their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law at home, making the family more united, and they worked even harder. For example, Wang Gui'e has four sisters-in-law, the eldest sister-in-law has children at home to cook, and three of them participate in mutual aid. When calculating the wages, they bought a piece of clothing material for the eldest sister-in-law's child, and Chunmei bought a piece of cloth for her mother-in-law to sew a pillow. This not only solved their own difficulties, but also saved family expenses. Chunmei said: "Although we go to the fields, the old people are old and make the meals early, and they also boil water and put it there waiting for us, so we should buy them something."

(Editor's note: It is very good for women to participate in agricultural mutual aid groups and should be rewarded, but as mentioned in the article, the method of "setting aside a portion of the wages to buy things for family members" in addition to spending it on themselves is inappropriate. In the beginning, this can be done temporarily to encourage women to go to the fields, but it is not a long-term solution; it should be based on the principle of combining with family production, as part of the entire family income, and implement reasonable profit sharing with the family. Because the family is the basic production unit in rural areas.)

### 沁源四园村　妇女普遍互助收割犁种都行

　　沁源四园村
  　妇女普遍互助收割犁种都行
    【太岳电】沁源四园村妇女过去就参加农业劳动，并有互助习惯。今年把大型互助改为小型互助后，更普遍参加了互助变工。其中以侯家园和温富兰二人领导的一个互助分队最好。全分队十三人，从下种到现在做了二百二十九个工，其中有五十八个是给组外人作的，赚了二石五斗三升小米。春耕开始时，全闾十五个男全劳力全部出外参战，本村里只剩五个老汉在家。温富兰等便互助起来下地，代替男人，从喂牛，铡草，担水到送粪，收割、犁种，什么都干，一春天送了五十多亩地的粪，收麦时，全分队共用七十个工，妇女就占了四十个。拔玉茭苗时，全分队一百三十四亩完全是妇女拔出来的。她们在互助变工上，除了自愿结合以外，又有许多地方适合妇女要求：第一、无论变工或卖工，都按活分配，按活记分。锄苗按垄按行记工，便利了因奶孩作饭等牵累，必须迟到早退的人，真正作到了做一分记一分，变一分得一分，互不吃亏。第二、工资分配公平合理，如分拔玉茭工资时，剩下五十元钱，没法分，便买了一盒洋火大家分了。第三、合理照顾，解决困难。春耕时派下十一双军鞋，有十一个妇女的小孩都种上了牛痘，有的妇女有病，温富兰就和大家商量这回不派她们做，将来再作，经过大家讨论都同意，这样照顾了大家实际困难，大家都高兴。第四、妇女赚下工资除了自己称花、买针、买鞋面布等必需费用外，抽出一部分给家里婆婆妯娌都买些东西，家庭更团结，她们干得也更有劲。如王桂娥妯娌四个，老大嫂有小孩在家做饭，她们三人参加互助，算回工资来，给老大嫂的小孩买了一个衣料，春梅给他婆婆买了一块缝枕头的布，既解决了自己困难，又节省了家庭开支。春梅说：“咱虽去地，老人们年纪大了，早早就把饭做现成了，还烧下开水放在那里等咱，咱给买点东西也是应该的。”
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （编者按：妇女参加生产互助组是很好的，应予奖励，但如文中所说，＠下工资除自己花用外，才“抽出一部分给家里人买点东西”的办法不妥当。在最初为鼓励妇女下地，可以暂时如此，但非长久之计；应根据和家庭生产结合的原则，作为整个家庭收入的一部分，实行与家庭合理分红等办法。因为家庭是农村中基本的生产单位。）
