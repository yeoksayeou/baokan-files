Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to delayed news, on May 5th, the democratic parties, democratic groups, and non-party人士 in Hong Kong, in addition to sending a telegram to Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party in response to the CCP's May 1st situation proposals, also sent a telegram to domestic and foreign newspapers and organizations, stating: "To domestic and foreign newspapers, organizations, and all compatriots nationwide: The reactionary Nanjing government has stolen power and betrayed the country, an unprecedented act. Recently, it has colluded with American imperialism, submitting to its dictates in all matters related to politics, economy, military affairs, and the nation's destiny. It has sabotaged the Political Consultative Conference and torn up the Five Agreements, leading to prolonged civil war and untold suffering. Now, it is fabricating democracy in an attempt to deceive the world. It even forgets the nation's great hatred and agrees to support the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. Our country is now equivalent to an appendage of American imperialism, and all compatriots will inevitably become sacrifices in a future world war. We are deeply anxious and are trying to find countermeasures. Looking at the situation at home and abroad, we were about to make proposals. Then we read item five of the Chinese Communist Party's May 1st Labor Day slogans: 'All democratic parties, people's organizations, and social leaders should promptly convene a political consultative conference to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's representative assembly and the establishment of a democratic coalition government,' which suits the needs of the people and the times, and especially conforms to our intentions. In addition to sending a telegram to the CCP to express our views, this matter concerns the future of the nation and is extremely important. People across the country should quickly concentrate their will, study methods, in order to eradicate the reactionaries and realize democracy. We hereby send this telegram, hoping for your prompt action and guidance." Signed by Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Ma Xulun, Wang Shao'ao, Chen Qiyou, Peng Zemin, Li Zhangda, Cai Tingkai, Tan Pingshan, Guo Moruo, etc. It is noted that the two telegrams from the democratic parties, democratic groups, and non-party personages in Hong Kong were issued in May. Due to transportation difficulties, their full text only recently arrived here. In addition to the telegram, those in Hong Kong who responded to the CCP's May 1st situation proposals also included the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the China Zhi Gong Party, and figures from all walks of life such as Feng Yufang, Liu Yazi, Zhang Naiqi and other 125 people, women's figures such as Liu Wang Liming, Kong Deqiu, Zheng Kunlian and other 232 people, and academics such as Guo Moruo, Ma Xulun, Shen Zhiyuan, Deng Chumin, Qian Jiaju, Zeng Zhaolun and other 19 people, who successively issued declarations in May and June.
