[Chahar Telegram] In the three special districts of Northern Yue, counties have rushed to plant 16,804 mu of wasteland, and are continuing to focus on wasteland reclamation. The area has a total of 30,979 mu of wasteland, most of which is located in border areas and areas adjacent to the enemy. Some of the masses in these areas were forced into "human circles" by the Chiang bandits, some fled into the liberated areas due to the devastation caused by the Chiang bandits, and some landlords and rich peasants fled into the Chiang-controlled areas, resulting in the abandonment of vast tracts of land. There are 10,000 mu of wasteland in the "no-man's land" of Huailai. In Wanping's sixth district, the fleeing households left 2,700 mu of wasteland. In total, the wasteland caused by the Chiang disaster in the entire area amounts to 23,463 mu, accounting for more than 75% of the total wasteland. During the concentrated rush planting, the consolidated areas universally implemented wasteland investigation and elimination, putting forward the slogan of "not leaving one mu of land uncultivated." In mid-May, Laishui County proposed that wasteland reclamation was the focus of current production work, and the whole county formed a surge of enthusiasm for wasteland reclamation. The leadership helped the masses solve production difficulties, stipulating that during the concentrated week, everyone should rush to plant their own wasteland, and after seven days, others could freely rush to plant, with whoever plants reaping the harvest, and reduced burden. The fourth district of the county has 468 mu of wasteland, and after fifteen days of concentrated effort, 434 mu have been planted. In Fangshan County, party members and cadres played a significant role in wasteland reclamation. The Dachangling area of the first district had more than 70 mu of wasteland, and after the branch mobilized party members to take the lead, it has all been planted. In the border areas, there are even more diverse methods of wasteland reclamation: first, striving to have fleeing households and those "circled away" by the Chiang bandits return home, with the government providing loans of grain and funds to solve their production difficulties. Huailai, in conjunction with political offensives and armed struggle, launched the "movement to liberate the circled masses and return them to their hometowns." In Huazhuang Village alone, 95 households returned. In Cijiawu and other four villages in Liangxiang, 374 households and 1,439 people returned. In Changwan, 124 households and 330 people returned, and under the leadership and assistance of the government, they rushed to plant. Second, the militia provides armed cover for the masses to rush plant. The third district of Liangxiang established a front-line command post, organized the militia to strengthen sentry posts, laid mines to block the enemy, and covered the masses to complete the cultivation of more than 2,300 mu of land in the entire district. Third, organize relatives and friends of fleeing households to cultivate on their behalf. In a village in Huailai, relatives and friends of fleeing households cultivated 745 mu of land on their behalf. Changwan stipulates that when the owner of the land cultivated on their behalf returns, they must pay the cultivator a certain amount of livestock, seeds, and wages; if the owner does not return, whoever cultivates the land receives the harvest. As a result of the land being cultivated on behalf in Xiaweidian Village, each person cultivated an average of one mu more than in previous years. Fourth, collective cultivation, with grain distributed according to work points. In the second district of Huailai, the masses collectively rushed to plant more than 1,000 mu of wasteland, and more than 2,000 mu of land in Tazhao Village in the sixth district of Fangshan were also collectively planted by the masses. In Chitu Village, Lai Zhuo, the militia collectively cultivated the land to solve the problem of war rations. Fifth, adjust and allocate the land to other villages, or organize manpower from other villages to help each other in rushing to plant. Cijiawu and other four villages in Liangxiang adjusted and allocated more than 1,700 mu of land to Dongzhuang and other four villages for cultivation. Wanping organized the masses from the fifth and seventh districts to help cultivate in villages with more wasteland in the sixth district. Sixth, young and middle-aged people and the elderly exchanged work for land to plant. In a village in the area adjacent to the enemy in Fangshan, young people were afraid of being captured by the enemy and dared not return home, so they exchanged work for land with the elderly at home, giving the land close to the enemy to the elderly to plant, and the land far from the enemy to the young and middle-aged people to plant. Some villages hired elderly people to return to production. Seventh, based on the strength of labor, wasteland was allocated to households, and loans of grain and funds were provided to solve difficulties. This is how wasteland was eliminated in Xiaweidian in Changwan, Bancheng in Lai Zhuo, and the third and sixth districts of Fangshan. It is stipulated that all the wasteland rushed to be planted above will be appropriately reduced or exempted from burdens, so the masses have eliminated their ideological concerns and their enthusiasm has been raised. Currently, various places are continuing to focus on wasteland reclamation.

　　北岳边缘区领导与群众结合
    消灭荒地办法多
  　三专区灭荒万六千多亩
    【察哈尔电】北岳三专各县抢种荒地一万六千八百零四亩，现仍继续突击灭荒中。该区共有荒地三万零九百七十九亩，其中绝大部分在边缘区和接敌区。上述地区有些群众被蒋匪逼入“人圈”，有些不堪蒋匪摧残逃入解放区内部，有些地主富农逃入蒋区，以致荒芜广大土地。怀来“无人区”内荒地万亩。宛平六区十个村逃亡户荒地二千七百亩，总计全区因蒋灾荒地二万三千四百六十三亩，占全部荒地总数百分之七十五以上。在突击抢种中，巩固区普遍执行查荒灭荒，提出“不荒一亩地”的口号。涞水县在五月中提出灭荒是当前生产工作的重点，全县形成抢荒热潮。领导上帮助群众解决生产困难，规定在突击周内各人抢种自己的荒地，七天后别人可自由抢种，谁种谁收，减征负担。该县四区荒地四百六十八亩，经十五天突击，已种上四百三十四亩。房山县在灭荒中，党员干部起了很大作用，一区大草领七十多亩荒地，经支部动员党员带头，已全部种上。在边缘区，灭荒办法更是多种多样：首先是争取逃亡户和被蒋匪“圈走”者还乡，由政府贷粮款解决其生产困难。怀来结合政治攻势与武装斗争，开展“解放被圈群众还乡运动”，化庄一村即回来九十五户。良乡磁家务等四个村回来三百七十四户、一千四百三十九人。昌宛还乡者一百二十四户，三百三十口人，在政府领导帮助下突击抢种。第二。民兵武装掩护群众抢种。良乡三区成立前方指挥所，组织民兵加强岗哨，埋雷封锁敌人、掩护群众完成全区二千三百多亩地的耕播。第三、组织逃亡户亲友代耕。怀来某村由逃亡户亲友代种地七百四十五亩。昌宛规定：代种地之本主回来，须付给种地人一定的牲畜、籽种及工资费；本主不回来即谁处谁收。该县下苇甸村代种土地的结果，每人平均比往年多种一亩。第四、集体耕种，按工分粮。怀来二区群众集体抢种荒地一千多亩，房山六区塔照村二千多亩地也是群众集体种上的。涞涿赤土村是由民兵集体耕种，解决战粮问题。第五、调剂给外村，或组织外村人力互助抢种。良乡磁家务等四村调剂出一千七百多亩地，分给东庄等四村种。宛平组织五、七区群众到六区荒地多的村庄帮助耕种。第六、青壮年和老人拨工换地种。房山接敌区某村青年怕敌人抓捕，不敢回家，就和在家老人拨工换地，把距敌人近的地交给老人种，距敌人远的地由青壮年种。有些村庄则雇用老年人回去生产。第七、根据劳力强弱，将荒地分配到户，并贷粮贷款解决困难。昌宛下苇甸，涞涿板城，房山三、六区都是这样消灭荒地的。以上所有抢种的荒地，均规定酌情减免负担，故群众解除了思想顾虑，情绪提高，现各地正在继续突击灭荒。
