[Taihang Telegram] Local armed forces and militia in northern Henan recently continuously crushed the Chiang bandits' grain-grabbing offensives and proactively launched attacks into Chiang-occupied areas, eliminating 248 enemies in total. On July 12th, the Mulandi store, the puppet security regiment of Wu Zhi County, led by regimental commander Zhao Choujiu and deputy regimental commander Qin Tongqing, led more than 800 troops in three routes to invade and grab grain in the areas of Fucun, Sili, Zhu Han, and Yuancun. The local militia, combined with a certain work team, immediately outflanked and surrounded them, killing 31 enemies and routing them. They also captured alive the enemy Major Regimental Deputy Qin Tongqing. On the evening of the 25th, the Qi County puppet security regiment stationed in Huangfu, combined with the Juqiao and Pangcun puppet township offices, under the personal leadership of bandit leader Yang Fu, launched a long-distance raid on Dalaidian in our interior, attempting to seize grain on a large scale. By dawn on the 26th, they were surrounded by a certain unit of our local armed forces. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits, unable to withstand the attack, fled southward in a panic. In this battle, a total of 70 puppet Qi County security regiment members, including the wounded bandit regimental commander Yang Fu, were killed or wounded, and 49 enemy platoon leaders and below were captured. More than 18 carts, more than 20 livestock, and more than 20,000 kilograms of grain were recovered and immediately handed over to the local government for distribution to the masses. At the same time, a local unit active near Jiaozuo heroically repelled a grain-grabbing invasion by more than 200 bandits under Wang Delin, stationed in Beizhucun (under Jiaozuo County), killing or wounding 21 enemies. The militia in the Xiuwu area also went deep behind enemy lines, proactively launching grain protection battles and supporting the anti-grain-grabbing struggle of the masses in the Chiang-occupied areas. On the nights of July 9th and 10th, the militia extended to Xiaowang Village, one li away from the enemy stronghold of Daiwang Village, and launched a military and political offensive against the puppet self-defense regiment. Seven bandits surrendered with eight guns. After education, they were completely released. On the 11th, dozens of Chiang bandits snatched 15 head of cattle from the masses in Wangmuquan Village. When they returned to Motaikou, they were ambushed by the militia, wounding two enemies and completely intercepting the cattle, which were immediately returned to their original owners. On the 16th, a certain unit ambushed the puppet Xin'an Township Self-Defense Regiment that was invading Xiaowang Village, annihilating a squad of bandits, capturing seven enemies, and seizing four rifles. Local armed forces active near the enemy stronghold of Daiwang in Jiaozuo achieved three victories in three battles on the 23rd, 24th, and 26th, annihilating 71 enemies and briefly liberating Niuzhuang Village, five li northeast of Jiaozuo. In all the above battles, a total of 137 enemies, including the wounded bandit regimental commander Yang Fu, were killed or wounded, and 111 enemies, including the captured enemy Major Regimental Deputy Qin Tongqing, were captured. Three light machine guns, 111 rifles, 12 short guns, more than 2,100 rounds of ammunition, and one telephone were seized.
[Taihang Telegram] Belated news: In the wheat protection struggle in northern Henan during May and June, a total of 137 battles, large and small, were fought, killing, wounding, and capturing 711 bandits, seizing one mortar, three machine guns, one submachine gun, 107 other various long and short guns, and destroying 23 bandit bunkers.
