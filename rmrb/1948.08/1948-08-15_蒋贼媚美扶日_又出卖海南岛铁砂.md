    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] According to a Tokyo dispatch from the US Information Service on the 1st, the traitorous Kuomintang government has sold another 200,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island to Japan. The sales contract has been signed by the British Ode Company and the Japanese Government Commerce Bureau. Loading is scheduled to begin in October and be completed in eight months. This is the second sale of Hainan Island iron ore by the Kuomintang. The first batch of 250,000 tons was sold to Japan at the end of last year. According to the US Information Service, this batch of iron ore will be shipped in October.
    According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Kaohsiung on July 14th, the Kuomintang government, following the orders of its American masters, is expanding "trade" with the US-occupied zone of South Korea. Following the opening of Shanghai and Tianjin as "ports for trade with Korea" in March of this year, it has now decided to open Kaohsiung and Keelung as ports for trade with Korea.
