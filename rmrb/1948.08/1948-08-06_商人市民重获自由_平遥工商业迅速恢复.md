    Taiyue Telegram: The democratic government's policy of protecting industry and commerce, coupled with the People's Liberation Army's strict discipline, has garnered enthusiastic support from the 50,000 merchants and citizens of Pingyao, a renowned commercial city in central Shanxi newly liberated. The city's landscape has fully recovered, with all 300+ stores open for business, and many merchants are raising capital, preparing to expand their operations. Teachers who were deceived by the Yan bandit regime and had left the city have all returned, and both levels of primary schools officially resumed classes as early as the 25th of last month. What excites the merchants and citizens most is regaining the freedom they had long lost – now merchants can freely conduct business, and citizens can go outside the city at will. An old gentleman on Cross Street, recalling the Yan bandit regime, said with emotion: "I am seventy years old, and I have never seen such rule. To enter the city, one had to have three certificates: a national ID card, a travel permit, and a group registration card. If relatives and friends came to stay overnight, one had to have a triplicate form: certified by the ward chief, street chief, and police station, which prevented relatives and friends from visiting, and daughters couldn't even stay at their parents' homes." Merchants, when talking about the Yan bandit's exploitation and oppression, could readily produce many receipts, large and small: in addition to the so-called regular taxes such as business tax, stamp duty, and income tax, when Yan officials were promoted, there were promotion fees; when they retired, they wanted travel expenses; when they married, had children… all sorts of fees had to be paid. A medium-sized store had to bear more than 100 shi of fine grain a year, and even a small vendor had to pay more than one shi a month. Before the July 7th Incident, there were more than 700 shops in the city; during the enemy's rule, over 500 households remained; under the Yan bandit regime, only over 300 households remained. When citizens denounced the Yan bandit's crimes, they said: "Countless people were forced to death by the Yan bandit because they could not afford the donations and taxes, were beaten to death with clubs, or were killed after being labeled as 'pseudo-elements.'"

    商人市民重获自由
    平遥工商业迅速恢复
    【太岳电】民主政府保护工商业政策，及解放军严明的纪律，已获得新解放的晋中著名商业城市——平遥城五万商民的热烈拥护。该城市面已完全恢复，三百余家商店全部开张营业，不少商人正筹集资本，准备扩大经营。被阎匪欺骗一度离城的教员已全部返回，两级小学早于上月二十五日即正式开课。商人与市民最兴奋的是获得了长期失掉的自由——现在商人可以自由营业，市民可以随便出城了。十字街的某老先生在回忆阎匪统治时感慨的说：“我七十多啦，没见过这样的统治，进城得有三证：国民身份证、路证、编组证。亲朋来住一夜得有三联单：经过闾长街长警察所证明，害的亲朋不能往来，闺女也不能住娘家了。”商人们谈起阎匪的剥削压榨时，随时可以拿出许多大大小小的单据：除了营业税、印花税、所得税等十三种所谓正税外，阎宫们升了官有升官费，退休了要盘缠费，娶妻嫁女生小孩……都要出什么费，一个中等商店一年得负担细粮百石以上，一个小摊贩每月也得出一石多。七七事变前该城有七百多家商铺，敌人统治时，剩下五百多户，阎匪统治时只剩下三百多户。市民们在控诉阎匪罪恶时说：“因为负担不起捐税，被阎匪逼死的，乱棍打死的，或被指为‘伪装分子’残杀的，不计其数。”
