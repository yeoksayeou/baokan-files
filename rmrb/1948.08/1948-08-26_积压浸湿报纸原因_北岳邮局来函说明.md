　　Reasons for Accumulated and Soaked Newspapers
  　Explanation from Beiyue Post Office

　　Recently, due to continuous rain, mountain floods, and overflowing rivers, unseen in recent years, postal traffic has been greatly hindered. For example, after July 20th (for five or six days), the Hutuo River and Shahe River were deep and turbulent, cutting off postal routes. Documents and newspapers were all held up on the south bank of the river, and were only transported across after the water receded slightly. However, due to limited transportation capacity, they could not be sent out all at once, and had to be transported in batches. The recent delay or receipt of several issues of newspapers is due to this reason. Secondly, due to the negligence of the traffic personnel in the continuous rain, damp and water damage were unavoidable. To minimize losses, we dried any wet mail before sending it, which also caused the date of receipt of mail and newspapers to be reversed and delayed. The Bureau will do its best to improve the above problems. We hereby explain.

### 积压浸湿报纸原因　北岳邮局来函说明

　　积压浸湿报纸原因
  　北岳邮局来函说明
    近因阴雨连绵，山洪暴发，河水暴涨，为近几年来所未有，致使邮政交通受到了很大障碍。如七月二十日后（五六天），滹沱河沙河水势深猛，断绝邮路，文件报纸均压在了河南岸，待后水势稍浅，才设法运过。但因运输力所限，不能一次发走，只得陆续运送。近来报纸文件不及时或看数期即是此因。其次由于阴雨河多交通员不慎，潮湿、浸坏现象也难避免，凡浸湿之邮件，我们为了少受损失，晒干再发，致使邮件报纸收到日期颠倒，迟慢的现象也不少。以上问题本局当尽力改进，特此说明。
