    [Taihang Electric] A comprehensive report from the Fifth Sub-district of Northern Henan: Since late June, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, having failed to seize wheat, have desperately launched attacks and plundered grain. Our sub-district's local armed forces and militias have also taken the initiative to打击the enemy. On June 22nd, the Huixian Brigade, in conjunction with the district cadres' team and the armed work team, learned of enemy incursions and ambushed the enemy in the areas of Jiushengying and Dongxi Liudian, repelling two companies of the Huixian puppet保安队 attempting to seize grain,歼敌53 enemy soldiers with no casualties on our side. On June 30th, part of the local armed forces took the initiative to attack and protect grain, capturing the enemy stronghold of Kuaicunying, more than 30 li northwest of Xinxiang. Most of the defending bandits, the three companies of the "Xinxiang People's Self-Defense Force" First Brigade and the Fifth Company of the Second Brigade, were歼敌. On June 24th, 27th, and July 1st, the Anyang militia, in a joint defense operation, repelled three incursions by Chiang's puppets of four to five hundred men attempting to seize grain. On July 5th, more than 300 die-hard bandits from Tangyin and Junxian counties attempted to seize grain. We obtained intelligence and immediately set up an ambush in the Yecheng area. When the enemy entered our encirclement, we launched a fierce assault on the enemy from all directions. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy fled back to their old lair in Junxian. The puppet battalion commander Cui Jizhong (wounded) and 38 others were killed or wounded. A certain armed work team and militia in Hongxian, in a joint operation, actively attacked the enemy east of the Pinghan Road during the half-month grain protection struggle from June 21st to July 6th, repelling large-scale grain seizing incursions by enemies one and a half to two times our size five times. Seven enemy soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, and the position east of the Pinghan Road was maintained. On July 4th, Yang Fu, Gao Yongqing, and other units of bandits and puppets in Qixian County, combined with township armed forces, totaling more than 300 men, with more than ten carts of grain, launched a full-scale attack on the Second District of Qixian County, invading more than ten villages, attempting to seize grain on a large scale. Our Qixian County militia home guards, cooperating with a unit of the county battalion, actively打击the enemy's grain-seizing team, drove away the enemy seizing grain in Cuiwangzhuang, and took advantage of the victory to rush to Dongqiao Village, killing and wounding a total of four enemy soldiers, intercepting five carts and three dan of wheat. On the night of the 7th, a certain unit of our local armed forces, along with bandits and puppets from Ji (County) and Qi (County) launched a grain protection offensive, launching a multi-pronged attack on six enemy strongholds, including Huangfu and Banqiao, completely歼敌杨富部四大队, and the entire puppet Changtun Township Office, and part of the puppet First Brigade. On the 17th at dawn, more than 120 members of the Huixian puppet保安团 attacked Xiaoying, attempting to seize grain, but were repelled by our district cadres' team and militia. In total, in one month of anti-grain seizure operations, 152 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, 233 enemy soldiers were captured, and four light machine guns, 187 rifles, 29 short guns, and 7,930 rounds of various bullets were seized. Recently, Liu Lexian's bandit puppet unit in Anyang is preparing five days' worth of dry food, attempting to invade our area to seize grain and conscript soldiers on a large scale. We are closely watching them.
