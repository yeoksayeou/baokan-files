　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 13th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL) has expelled all Christian Democratic labor union leaders within the CGIL who betrayed the working class and advocated splitting the CGIL. These Christian Democratic scabs, since their disruptive activities against the general strike in December of last year, reached their peak during the attempted assassination of Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti last month. In addition to continuing to sabotage the general strike that erupted at the time, they also formed their own labor unions under the direct command of De Gasperi to carry out a split. On August 7th, the CGIL decided to expel these scabs from the confederation. The resolution stated: "This split is the inevitable result of the Christian Democratic elements' open sabotage activities during the recent general strike and previous strikes." The resolution also urged rank-and-file Christian Democratic workers to maintain trade union unity, and their political and religious beliefs will continue to be respected. It is also reported that this action by the Christian Democratic scabs has even been opposed by some other Christian Democratic labor union leaders. Baba, the secretary of the United Federation of Transport Workers' Unions (a Christian Democrat), Amido, a member of the National Committee of the Chemical Workers' Union, and many other local labor union leaders have all announced that they will continue to be loyal to the CGIL. It is reported that the CGIL has a total membership of seven million, with the Italian Communist Party accounting for 60 percent and the Christian Democrats only 11 percent.

　　意大利总工会开除工贼
    【新华社陕北十三日电】各方报导：意大利总工会已将总工会中一切背叛工人阶级主张分裂意大利总工会的基督教民主党工会领袖开除会籍。这些基民党工贼们自去年十二月对总罢工进行其破坏活动以来，至上月意共领袖托格里亚蒂被刺案发生时，已发展至最高峰。他们除对当时爆发之总罢工续施破坏以外，并在加斯贝利直接指挥下自组工会，进行分裂。总工会于八月七日决定将此等工贼开除出总工会。决议指出：“这种分裂是基民党分子在最近一次总罢工，和以前多次罢工中公然进行破坏活动的必然结果”。决议同时敦促基民党下层工人保持工会团结，其政治及宗教信仰仍将受到尊重。另悉，基民党工贼们之此种行动，甚至受到另外一些基民党工会领袖的反对。运输工人工会联合会书记（基民党人）巴巴和化学工人联合会全国委员会委员阿米多，及其他许多地方工会领袖，均宣布继续忠实于总工会。按总工会人数共七百万，意共力量占百分之六十，基民党仅占百分之十一。
