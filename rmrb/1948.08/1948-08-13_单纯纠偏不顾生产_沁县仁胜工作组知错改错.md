　　Single-Minded Focus on Rectification Neglects Production
  　Qin County Ren Sheng Work Group Acknowledges and Corrects Mistakes
　　[Taiyue Telegraph] The Ren Sheng base area work group in Qin County, from the beginning of May until now, has been continuously emphasizing rectification and abandoning leadership over production. They believed that they were there to do rectification work and didn't have to manage production, putting production and rectification in opposition to each other. Regardless of how busy the masses were with production, they still took time out to "rectify deviations." On May 15th, heavy rain washed away part of the village's millet seedlings. The masses were busy replanting, patching, and resowing, but the work group didn't immediately lead this urgent work. Instead, they forced everyone to take time out of their afternoon naps to "discuss class designation." At the time, village cadres and the masses opposed this, requesting that they designate after they were through being busy with this for a few days. The work group said: "The higher-ups will be summarizing the rectification work in a few days. What will we do if we don't finish by then?" They continued to force the masses to hold meetings, which made the masses feel a headache whenever they heard about meetings. Some people, upon hearing that a meeting was to be held, hurriedly picked up their plows and drove their livestock to the fields. Some, who couldn't escape in time, would try to sneak away halfway through the meeting. But the work group remained unrepentant, continuing to instruct the peasant association chairman to "close the door and hold meetings." They believed that there was nothing to lead in production work. The mutual aid teams were gone, and the existing small mutual aid groups of three to five people didn't need leadership. At the time of seed planting, the village had organized twenty-four mutual aid teams, with one hundred and twenty-four people participating, but because the work group didn't lead or promote them, these mutual aid teams all collapsed, leaving only Li Erniu's group. During the time when weeding was needed, four-tenths of the village had gone to participate in the war effort. The work group turned a blind eye to such a significant problem and continued to rectify their "deviations" as usual, making it impossible to weed half of the two thousand five hundred mu of millet. Some fields were weeded too late, and the weeds grew into a patch, turning the seedlings yellow. Faced with these serious phenomena, after repeated practical education from the masses, the work group has begun to wake up. They recently made a more profound self-criticism, recognizing that they had made a big mistake in front of the people, and they are determined to correct it. Now, all the cadres of the group are fully mobilizing male and female semi-laborers to rush to weed the seedlings, hoe the wheat fields, gather manure, and rectify the mutual aid teams to overcome the difficulty of labor shortage, so that the fields of the militiamen who have gone out to participate in the war can also be cultivated on time.

    Editor's Note: Resolutely rectifying deviations is to develop production, so it is correct. If rectification is isolated, and rectification is carried out for the sake of rectification, and the leadership of production is not undertaken, it is wrong. The Ren Sheng base area work group in Qin County only emphasized rectification and abandoned the leadership of production, which showed that they did not understand the purpose of rectification. It reflects that the comrades of the work group lacked analysis and research on the party's policies. In the implementation, they grasped one aspect and forgot the other. The task was a simple perspective. It should be reviewed and changed quickly. Ren Sheng work group has been changing this shortcoming, and it is hoped that they will continue to conduct in-depth self-examination from the ideological perspective.

### 单纯纠偏不顾生产　沁县仁胜工作组知错改错

　　单纯纠偏不顾生产
  　沁县仁胜工作组知错改错
    【太岳电】沁县仁胜基点工作组，从五月初到现在一直强调纠偏，放弃领导生产。认为自己是来作纠偏工作的，不管生产工作，把生产和纠偏对立起来。不管群众生产多忙，也要抽时间“纠偏”。五月十五日大雨冲毁了该村一部分谷苗，群众正忙着抢种补种重种，工作组不是立即领导这一紧急工作，而是强迫着大家抽午睡时间“讨论划成份”。当时村干部和群众都提出反对意见，要求忙过这几天再划，工作组说：“上级过几天就总结纠偏工作，到那时完不成怎么办？”继续强迫群众开会，闹的群众一听说开会就头疼。有的人听说要开会，就慌忙拿起犁，赶着牲口上地里去，有的一时没走脱，也在会开到一半想法溜走。但工作组仍不觉悟，继续指使农会主席“关门开会”。他们认为生产工作没什么可领导的，互助大队没有了，现存的小型互助组三、五个人一组，用不着领导。在养种时候该村已组织了二十四个互助组，有一百二十四人参加，但因工作组不领导、不提倡，这些互助组都垮了，只剩下了李二牛那一个组。正在锄苗用人的时候，全村有十分之四的人参战走了。工作组对如此重大的问题仍熟视无睹，照旧纠他的“偏”，使二千五百亩谷子有一半没法锄苗。有些地因锄的太晚，地里草长成一片，把苗都荒成黄颜色。面对着这些严重现象，经过群众数度的实际教育，该工作组已开始觉悟，日前并作了较深刻的检查，认识了在人民面前犯了一个大错误，决心改正。现在全组干部正全力动员男女整半劳力突击锄苗，刹麦地，闹粪，整顿互助组，克服劳力缺乏的困难，使出外参战的民兵们地里的生活也能按时耕作。
    编者按：坚决纠偏是为了发展生产，所以是正确的，如果把纠偏孤立起来，为纠偏而纠偏，不去领导生产是错误的。沁县仁胜基点工作组只强调纠偏放弃生产领导，是不懂得纠偏的目的性，反映了工作组同志对党的政策缺乏分析研究，在执行中，抓紧这一面就忘了那一面，是单纯任务观点作崇，应该迅予检讨改变。这种缺点仁胜工作组已在改变，希望能继续从思想上深刻检查。
