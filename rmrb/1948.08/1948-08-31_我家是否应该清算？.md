　　Should My Family Be Classified as Landlords?
　　To the Editor:
　　In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), my father and I went to Beiping (Beijing) to do business. In the 27th year (1938), our hometown was occupied by the enemy. My second uncle disappeared, my third uncle joined the anti-Japanese government, and my fourth uncle, fearing being conscripted by the enemy, went elsewhere to work as a hired laborer. At home, we had two livestock, my grandfather participated in labor, and we employed one long-term farmhand. By the 32nd year (1943), our family returned from Beiping, and the family divided. I received fifteen mu of land, five rooms, no livestock, and incomplete tools. In addition, I had sixteen mu of land from my own savings and thirteen beehives. The following year, I hired one-third of a long-term farmhand, but never hired any long-term or short-term laborers after that. In the 35th year (1946), all of my grandfather's property was confiscated, and my grandfather committed suicide by jumping into a well. Last November, all of my family's property was confiscated again, leaving only three and a half rooms and nine and a half mu of land, making life difficult. The beehives and some of the property have not yet been distributed in the village. Based on the class division standards, what class status should I be assigned? Are the beehives considered handicrafts? Should they be returned? Furthermore, I am currently studying at Xingtai Normal School, but the village still asks me to hire someone to cultivate land on behalf of military families. Is this reasonable?

　　△Answer: If your grandfather participated in major labor; your fourth uncle genuinely worked as a hired laborer; your third uncle has been working in the democratic government for more than two years and has the status of a revolutionary staff member; and your family hired a long-term farmhand due to a shortage of labor, and the amount of exploitation did not exceed 25%, then you should be classified as a middle peasant. If it exceeds 25%, then you are a rich peasant. Your letter does not provide enough clarity to be certain. Beekeeping is a sideline occupation, and since it has not been distributed, it should be returned immediately. As you are studying at Xingtai Normal School, you should not be obligated to cultivate land on behalf of military families, but your family should still bear the obligation of cultivating land on behalf of military families according to its labor capacity.

　　我家是否应该清算？
    编辑同志：
    民国二十五年我和父亲到北平经商，二十七年家乡沦陷，二叔失踪，三叔参加抗日政府，四叔怕敌抓兵到外边当雇工，家有牲口两个，我祖父参加劳动，并用长工一人，到三十二年，我家从北平回来，同时家庭也分了家，我分到十五亩地、房五间，没有牲口，工具也不全，另外我自己积蓄地十六亩，有蜜蜂十三窝，第二年雇了三分之一长工，以后永没雇长短工，三十五年祖父财产全被没收，祖父投井自杀，去年十一月把我家财产又全部没收，只剩房三间半，地九亩半，生活困难，现在蜜蜂和一部财产村中还没分配。根据划阶级标准，我到底算啥成份？蜂是否算手工业？应退回吗？再者，我现在到邢台师范学习，村里还叫我雇人给军属代耕，这样合理不合理？

    △答：如果你祖父参加主要劳动；四叔真正给人家当雇工；三叔参加民主政府工作满二年，已是革命职员成份；家中因劳力缺乏雇一长工，如剥削分量不超过百分之二十五，应是中农成份，如超过则是富农，你来信说的不够清楚，不能肯定。养蜂是副业，既未分配，应即退回。你在邢台师范上学，本人不应负代耕义务，但家庭仍应按劳力情况负代耕义务。
