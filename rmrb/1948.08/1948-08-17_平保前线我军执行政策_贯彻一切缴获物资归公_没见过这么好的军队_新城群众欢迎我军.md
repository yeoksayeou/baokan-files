　　[Ji Zhong Electric Dispatch] A certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army has shown much progress in implementing policies in newly liberated areas and abiding by discipline during this Ping-Bao Campaign. Various units of the unit universally conducted education on policies in newly liberated areas beforehand. The Seventh Company of the unit implemented the slogan of "Three No Go's" in mass discipline, namely, "Don't leave until the water vat is full, the cleaning is not done, and opinions aren't solicited"; "Don't leave until borrowed items are returned and damaged items are compensated". In a village, the Eighth Squad of the Fourth Company of the unit broke a basin for the landlord. The landlord insisted that there was no need to pay for it. Before leaving, the squad's soldiers wrote a letter, put in five thousand yuan, and placed it in the landlord's food basket. The Second Battalion of another unit did not take anything from the captives in observing battlefield discipline, and promptly explained this to them. In an ambush in a village on July 15th, Zhang Xiaoyou of the Second Squad of the Fifth Company of the unit shot and wounded an enemy gunner and forced four enemies to stop. An enemy platoon leader wanted to give him his gold ring and pocket watch. Zhang Xiaoyou immediately said to him, "We don't want personal belongings!" and took out his own discipline code for them to see. Chai Laixi, the bugler of the Fifth Company of the unit, and Wang Yanju, the messenger, searched out a wounded enemy. Chai Laixi first bandaged him with his own wound dressing and then carried him to the headquarters. Guo Wenzhi of the Second Squad saw that the prisoners were afraid and immediately explained to them: "The People's Liberation Army does not beat or scold prisoners, does not kill prisoners, gives them travel expenses to go home, and assigns you work if you are willing to work." Putting their minds at ease. After liberating Xin City, a certain unit sent a large number of cadres to form a political work team to enter the city to carry out propaganda and investigation work. Afterwards, they seized the time to conduct a review of city entry discipline by section, group, and squad. The organization also registered and turned over to the public the items that individual comrades had kept. The discipline of "all seized materials are turned over to the public" was thoroughly implemented. The Special Service Company of a certain unit lived in a small shop. There was no one in the room. There were kerosene, cigarettes, and chicken eggs on the table. The instructor immediately put the things in the cabinet and sealed it. Gong Zhanyuan, a messenger from the company headquarters, borrowed an iron shovel from another house. There was no one in the house. There was an abacus, a fountain pen, and a pile of Chiang currency on the table in the hall. There were seven large and small bundles of clothes on the pit. They discovered that this belonged to a merchant and immediately reported it to the instructor and brought the merchant back to take care of it himself; he also explained our policy of protecting industry and commerce to him. The merchant expressed his gratitude.
