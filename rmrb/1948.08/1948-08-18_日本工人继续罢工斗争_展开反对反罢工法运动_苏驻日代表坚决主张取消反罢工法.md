　　Japanese Workers Continue Strike Struggle
  　Launch Campaign Against Anti-Strike Law
    Soviet Representative to Japan Firmly Advocates Abolishing Anti-Strike Law
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: The movement of Japanese workers against the anti-strike law is flourishing. According to a report by the Denchu Agency: Labor unions and democratic groups representing four million workers issued a statement in Tokyo on the 12th, condemning "Japanese rulers who committed war crimes for violating the Potsdam Declaration given by the world's democratic forces and reviving fascism." Not only major Japanese labor unions signed this statement, but also the Japan Farmers Union, Cooperative Committee, Democratic Women's Organizations Committee, and the All-Japan Student Union. According to Agence France-Presse: A mass demonstration against the anti-strike law will be held in the Imperial Palace Plaza on the 15th; the conference initiated by the labor union is expected to be attended by 200,000 workers. As of the 11th, the strike wave of Matsuyama City train drivers in Shikoku has not subsided; the strike situation in Hokkaido has become tense, and the strike of 270 train drivers has paralyzed 30 trains. Postal workers in some parts of Osaka announced a one-hour strike on the afternoon of the 11th. The postal workers' strike movement has spread to the counties north of Tokyo; the Gunma Prefecture Postal Workers Union has decided to strike on the 13th and stage a collective walkout on the 15th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Tokyo News: On the 11th, Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, General Kislenko, sent a letter to MacArthur, strongly condemning MacArthur's anti-Potsdam Declaration directives and the current anti-strike measures of the Japanese government, and warned MacArthur to cancel the aforementioned directives. According to TASS: The Soviet representative said in the letter: "I firmly advocate that your directive of July 22 regarding the amendment of the National Public Service Law, and the actions taken by the Japanese government in accordance with this directive, should be cancelled; because it violates the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's decisions on the basic policy towards Japan after surrender and the principles of the Japanese trade union organization." These decisions clearly stipulate that "the Japanese people should be encouraged to establish democratic organizations and trade unions," "Japanese trade unions have the right to participate in political activities, participate in the reconstruction of democratic countries, and participate in activities aimed at guaranteeing and improving the living standards and employment of Japanese workers," "workers have the right to strike, and it is forbidden to use the police or other government agency personnel to secretly monitor workers' means to undermine strikes or suppress the legitimate activities of trade unions," the Soviet representative emphasized: "However, in fact, the measures currently implemented by the US occupation authorities in Japan and the measures of the Japanese government are creating obstacles to the revival and strengthening of the democratic trends of the Japanese people, and in some cases are aimed at suppressing the activities of democratic organizations, especially trade unions," such as "taking repressive measures against trade union members and their leaders who participate in trade union activities, including mass layoffs, arrests, and hard labor sentences, has become commonplace in Japan."

　　日本工人继续罢工斗争
  　展开反对反罢工法运动
    苏驻日代表坚决主张取消反罢工法
    【新华社陕北十六日电】日本工人反对反罢工法的运动正蓬勃展开着。据电通社报导：代表四百万劳动者的工会和民主团体于十二日在东京发表声明，谴责“犯战罪的日本统治者们正违背世界民主力量所给予的波茨顿宣言，使法西斯主义复活”。在这声明上签署的，不仅有日本各大工会，而且有日本农民联盟、合作社委员会、民主妇女团体委员会及学生会总联盟等。据法新社消息：十五日将有反对禁止罢工法的示威性群众大会在皇宫广场举行；这个由工会所发动的大会，预料将有工人二十万参加。迄十一日止，四国的松山城火车司机罢工浪潮，还未平息；北海道的罢工情势转趋紧张，二百七十名火车司机的罢工已使三十列火车瘫痪。大坂部分地区的递信工人宣布于十一日下午罢工一小时。递信工人的罢工运动已蔓延至东京以北各县；群马县的递信工人工会已决定于十三日罢工，于十五日集体旷工。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】东京消息：盟国对日委员会苏联代表基斯连科将军于十一日致函麦克阿瑟，严辞斥责麦克阿瑟的反波茨顿宣言的指令与日本政府现行的反罢工措施，并正告麦克阿瑟应取消上述指令。据塔斯社报导：苏联代表在信中说：“我坚决主张：你七月二十二日关于修改全国公务员法的指令，以及日本政府遵奉这个指令所采取的行动，应予取消；因为它违反了波茨顿宣言和远东委员会关于投降后的对日基本政策与日本工会组织原则的决定”。这些决定明确规定：“鼓励日本人民建立民主的团体和工会”，“日本工会有权参加政治活动，参加民主的国家之重建工作，并参加旨在保证及改善日本工人生活标准与就业的活动”，“工人有权罢工，禁止使用警察或其他政府机关人员暗中监视工人的手段来破坏罢工或镇压工会的合法活动”，苏联代表着重指出：“然而事实上，美占领当局目前在日所实行的措施以及日本政府的措施，却制造着阻挠日本人民民主趋势之复活和加强的障碍，并且在某些事例上是以镇压民主组织的活动，特别是工会的活动为目的”，如象“对参加工会活动的工会会员及其领袖采取镇压手段，包括大批解雇、逮捕及判处苦役，在日本已成为司空见惯的事了。”
