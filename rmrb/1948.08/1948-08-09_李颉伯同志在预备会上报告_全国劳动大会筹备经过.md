Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: Comrade Li Jiebo, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Liberated Areas Workers' Representative Conference, reported at the preparatory meeting of the congress on July 31st regarding the preparations for the congress, stating: The Liberated Areas Trade Union Representative Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Yan'an in September 1941. As early as the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, workers in North China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and some veteran comrades of the original All-China Federation of Trade Unions, cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to persist in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines, participating in the establishment of anti-Japanese base areas. Workers in various regions successively established trade unions for various industries and local trade union federations in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi-Suiyuan, and Central China. By April 1945, there were over 800,000 organized workers. They made significant contributions to mobilizing workers for armed resistance against Japan, developing production, and conducting education and welfare programs for workers. In the spring of 1945, the trade union federations of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Shandong successively initiated the convening of a full Liberated Areas Trade Union Representative Conference to unify leadership and exchange experiences. Trade union federations in Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, Shanxi-Suiyuan, and Central China all responded enthusiastically. In April of the same year, representatives selected by the aforementioned Liberated Areas trade union federations established a preparatory committee in Yan'an, electing 25 members with Deng Fa as director and Cui Tianfu as deputy director, and decided to convene the Liberated Areas Trade Union Representative Conference in September. Subsequently, due to the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive and the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the preparatory committee members and representatives from various regions went to new areas to carry out work, leading the labor movement in the new areas, which caused the convening of the congress to be repeatedly postponed.

During this period, the preparatory committee represented workers in the Liberated Areas in international trade union movements. In September 1945, the preparatory committee cooperated with the China Labor Association, breaking through the shameless obstruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Deng Fa and Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the Labor Association, jointly formed a delegation and were invited to attend the Paris World Federation of Trade Unions, establishing international connections for the workers in the Liberated Areas for the first time. Comrade Deng Fa was also elected as an executive committee member and director of the World Federation of Trade Unions. After Comrade Deng Fa's death on April 8, 1946, the preparatory committee elected Comrade Liu Ningyi as director and represented the committee at the World Federation of Trade Unions conference.

In March of this year, due to the victorious development of the Liberation War, the number of organized workers in the Liberated Areas had reached 2,030,000, and the establishment of a unified organization was imperative. The preparatory committee issued a notice, scheduling the full Liberated Areas Trade Union Representative Conference to be held on June 10th in Harbin, the capital of the Northeast Liberated Area. After the news spread, workers in major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were greatly encouraged. Underground democratic trade unions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places successively sent telegrams requesting to attend the conference as observers and proposed expanding it into a National Trade Union Representative Conference. When Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the China Labor Association, arrived in Harbin, he also made the same suggestion. After unanimous agreement from the preparatory committee, the organization of the preparatory committee was expanded, and representatives from the Labor Association and prominent leaders of the Chinese workers' movement, including Chen Yun, Li Lisan, Cai Chang, Chen Yu, Zhu Xuefan, Liao Siguan, Zhang Weizhen, Zhang Jinbao, Tang Longchao, Liu Bin, Guo Hongtao, and Shao Shiyi, were added to participate in the preparatory work. Subsequently, due to the inability of representatives from within the customs to arrive in time, the convening of the congress was once again postponed. On July 19th, the expanded preparatory committee unanimously passed a resolution to convene the National Trade Union Representative Conference on "August 1st." On the 30th, the preparatory committee and representative delegations from various regions and industries across the country held a joint meeting and formally decided to propose to the congress to rename the National Trade Union Representative Conference as the Sixth National Labor Congress, and to rename the National Federation of Trade Unions as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in order to inherit the glorious tradition of the Chinese working class.

    李颉伯同志在预备会上报告
    全国劳动大会筹备经过
    【新华社东北六日电】解放区工人代表大会筹委会秘书长李颉伯同志于七月三十一日在大会预备会议上，报告大会筹备经过称：解放区职工代表大会，原定一九四一年九月在延安召开。远在抗日战争开始时，华北职工即在共产党与原中华全国总工会一部分老同志的领导下，配合人民解放军坚持敌后抗日战争，参加建立抗日根据地，各地工人曾先后在陕甘宁、晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀、山东、晋绥及华中等地，广泛地建立了各业工会及各地的职工总会，至一九四五年四月，有组织的职工达八十余万人。对发动工人武装抗日、发展生产，及进行职工的教育福利事业，都有巨大贡献。一九四五年春陕甘宁、晋冀鲁豫、山东三地总工会，为统一领导，交流经验，曾先后发起召开全解放区职工代表大会，晋察冀、晋绥、华中各解放区总工会均纷纷回应。同年四月间由上述各解放区总工会选派代表在延安成立筹备委员会，当选出筹委二十五人，邓发为主任、崔田夫为副主任，并决定九月间在延安召开解放区职工代表大会。旋因人民解放军大学反攻，日寇投降，各筹委与各地代表纷赴新区开辟工作，领导新区工运，致使大会的召开曾一再延期。
    在此期间，筹委会曾代表解放区职工参加国际职工运动。一九四五年九月筹委会与中国劳动协会合作，打破国民党反动派无耻阻挠，由邓发同志与劳协理事长朱学范先生共组代表团，应邀出席巴黎世界工联，首次建立了解放区职工的国际联系。邓发同志并当选世界工联执委和理事。一九四六年四月八日，邓发同志遇难后，筹委会继选刘宁一同志为主任，并代表该会出席世界工联会议。
    今年三月间，由于解放战争的胜利开展，解放区有组织的职工已达二百零三万人，建立统一组织已刻不容缓，筹委会乃发出通知，订于六月十日在东北解放区首府哈尔滨召开全解放区职工代表大会。消息传出后，国民党统治区各大城市的职工极为振奋。上海、天津等地地下民主工会均先后来电要求列席大会，并提议扩大为全国职工代表大会开始时，抵达哈尔滨的中国劳协理事长朱学范先生也提出同样建议。筹委会一致同意后，即扩大筹委会组织，增加劳协代表及中国职工运动的著名领导者陈云、李立三、蔡畅、陈郁、朱学范、廖似光、张维桢、张金保、唐龙超、刘彬、郭洪涛、邵式平等参加筹备工作。往后因关内代表不能及时抵达，大会的召开又一度延期。七月十九日，扩大的筹委会一致通过决议，定“八一”召开全国职工代表大会。三十日筹委会与全国各地各业代表团举行联席会议并正式决定向大会提议，将全国职工代表大会改名为第六次全国劳动大会。将全国总工会定名为中华全国总工会，以继承中国工人阶级的光荣传统。
