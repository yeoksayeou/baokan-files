Taihang News: In order to improve agricultural production, improve crop varieties, prevent pests and diseases, and correct the bureaucratic phenomenon of indifference to agricultural improvement in various counties and districts, the Taihang Third Special District Office issued instructions to the heads of all counties, heads of cooperative sections, and heads of farms, stating: This year, wheat in Zuoquan, Yushe, Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, and other counties has suffered from reduced harvests due to yellowing and blackening. In Xiangyuan, wheat production was reduced by more than 20,000 shi due to yellowing and blackening. The counties and farms did not help the masses prevent these diseases in advance. Now that the wheat planting season is approaching, many counties have not investigated and studied the causes of the disaster and prevention methods. This situation may cause greater losses to the masses in the next year. This year, a considerable amount of "811" millet has been planted in various counties. In terms of transplanting and weeding habits, this millet variety is different from local millet. The Special District Office has sent special letters to the counties to instruct planting methods, but it is unknown whether the counties have deployed this work and publicized it to the masses. We have not found the reason why the masses say that the harvest is not good, so it has also affected the promotion of this variety. In order to improve agricultural production, it is very important to promote excellent varieties, but it must proceed from reality and truly understand the characteristics of a good variety, and distinguish whether the poor harvest in this area is due to accidental reasons, or whether this variety is simply not suitable for the local climate and soil; do not blindly deny a variety (nor should you forcibly promote a certain variety without research and experimentation, even if it is very good in other regions—Editor). The feedback from the masses must be scientifically analyzed to obtain correct conclusions. All counties should immediately check and study the causes of wheat diseases and the deployment, publicity, and research of "811" millet, strengthen agricultural technical guidance, and avoid unnecessary losses in the coming year.

　　太行三专署指示各县
  　加强农业技术指导
  　调查小麦黄疸原因
    【太行讯】太行三专署为提高农业生产，改进作物品种，防止病虫害，纠正各县区对农业改进漠不关心的官僚主义现象，特对各县长、合作科长、农场场长发出指示称：今年左权、榆社、襄垣、武乡等县小麦，皆因患黄、黑疸歉收；襄垣小麦竟因黄、黑疸减少产量达二万余石。各县及农场对于此种病害，既未帮助群众事先防止，现在种麦期又将来到，许多县份亦未调查研究遭灾原因及防预办法。这种情况可能造成群众在下年度更大的损失。各县今年种植“八一一”谷为数不少。在拔苗与锄苗的习性上，该谷种均与本地谷不同，专署曾向各县专函指示种植方法，各县对这个工作是否已经布置，已向群众宣传，也渺无所闻。群众说收获不好，我们也没有找出原因，因此也影响了这种品种的推广。为了提高农业生产，推广优良品种是很重要的，但一定要从实际出发，真正认识一种好品种的特性，区别是由于偶然原因在此地收成不好，还是这种品种根本就不适宜本地气候土质；不要盲目的否定一种品种（也不应不加研究试验就强迫命令的推广某种品种，即使它在其它区域是很优良的——编者）。对群众的反映必须加上科学的分析，得到正确的结论。各县应立即检查研究小麦害病的原因及对“八一一”谷布置宣传和研究的情况，加强农业技术的指导，避免来年再受不应有的损失。
