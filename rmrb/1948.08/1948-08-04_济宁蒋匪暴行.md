Huadong Front, 23rd dispatch: Before fleeing the city, the 112th Brigade of Jiang Bandit's 12th Reorganized Division, from July 1st to 4th, wantonly arrested people in Jining, forcing them to completely demolish the 3,000-plus civilian houses in Hebei Street between the South Gate city wall and the canal. The bricks, tiles, and lumber were all used to build Jiang bandit fortifications. The area was reduced to rubble, with not even the foundations remaining. On May 7th of last year, Jiang bandit's 72nd Reorganized Division also carried out large-scale burning and looting in Hebei Street. At that time, the bandit troops removed the bridges over the canal, set up machine guns at the street entrances, and then set fire to the civilian houses. Many people who tried to escape were shot and killed. Taking advantage of the chaos, merchants were robbed clean. The fire burned for two days and nights, destroying most of the homes of over 300 households. The people gradually rebuilt them later, but unexpectedly, they were demolished again by Jiang bandit troops this time. The residents are displaced, and our democratic government is working to provide relief.

    济宁蒋匪暴行
    【华东前线廿三日电】济宁蒋匪整十二师一一二旅于弃城逃窜前，自七月一日至四日，在该城大肆抓人，逼人将南关城墙与运河间之河北街三千余间民房全部拆毁，砖瓦木料全被修建了蒋匪的工事。×多路一片瓦砾，连墙基也不剩。去年五月七日，蒋匪整七二师亦曾在河北街大肆烧掠，当时该匪将运河上的桥梁抽掉，街头架好机枪，然后放火大烧民房，群众跑到××被击死伤多人。乘此混乱之际商民被劫一空。大火连烧达二昼夜，三百余户民房大部被毁，后来群众逐渐修盖，不料此次又被蒋匪拆毁，居民流离失所，我民主政府正设法救济中。
