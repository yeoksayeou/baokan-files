Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 26th: A spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army sternly condemned Chiang Kai-shek's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents in Shijiazhuang with American-made aircraft, stating: This is yet another manifestation of the series of frantic struggles by Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, after his disastrous military defeats in June and July. Following Chiang Kai-shek's successive defeats in the Henan-East, Xiangfan, Central Shanxi, East China, East Hebei, and Guanzhong regions, he has politically and completely torn off the mask of the so-called "constitutional government" that the people had long recognized, and openly implemented fascist dictatorship. In major cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, etc., he has arrested large numbers of students. Economically, he has implemented "emergency measures" in the name of "currency reform," which are actually unprecedented inflation. Militarily, he has used aircraft supplied by American imperialism to bomb the North China Liberated Area city of Shijiazhuang, and distributed anonymous mimeographed leaflets, claiming that he would carry out "destructive bombing" of Shijiazhuang and was "determined to bomb continuously day and night." All of these are nothing but desperate measures, which will not only fail to save the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, but will also accelerate its collapse. No fascist atrocities can save the fate of the Sino-American reactionaries and Chiang Kai-shek. The spokesperson expressed deep condolences to the compatriots in Shijiazhuang who suffered, and called on all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to continue to win great victories, resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate the enemy, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, to avenge the people's city of Shijiazhuang. The spokesperson also called on the Kuomintang Air Force not to forget that they are Chinese, and not to drive American planes to slaughter their own compatriots for Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism.

  　痛斥蒋贼滥炸石市
    蒋介石狗急跳墙必将加速其反动统治的崩溃
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】人民解放军发言人痛斥蒋介石以美制飞机滥炸石家庄和平居民称：这是美国帝国主义走狗蒋介石在六七两月军事惨败之后一系列的疯狂挣扎中的又一表现。蒋介石在豫东、襄樊、晋中、华东、冀东、关中相继惨败之后，政治上彻底撕毁其早已被人民识破了的所谓“宪政”的假面具，赤裸裸的实行法西斯独裁，在平津宁沪渝等各大城市大批逮捕学生，在经济上实行名为“货币改革”而实际上是空前通货膨胀的“紧急措施”，在军事上以美国帝国主义供给的飞机轰炸华北解放区城市石家庄，并散发匿名的油印传单，说什么要对石家庄“施行摧毁性的轰炸，并决于白天夜间不断轰炸。”所有这些，都不过是狗急跳墙，不但不能丝毫挽救蒋介石反动统治的崩溃，并且必将加速其崩溃。任何法西斯暴行，不能挽救中美反动派和蒋介石的命运。发言人对石家庄被难同胞深致慰问，并号召人民解放军全体将士，继续打大胜仗，坚决彻底干净全部消灭敌人，打到南京去，活捉蒋介石，为人民城市石家庄报仇。发言人并号召国民党空军，不要忘记掉自己是中国人，不要替美国帝国主义的走狗蒋介石驾着美国飞机屠杀自己同胞。
