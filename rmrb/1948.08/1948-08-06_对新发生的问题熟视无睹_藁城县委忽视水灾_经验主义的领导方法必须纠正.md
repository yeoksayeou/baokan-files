    Ignoring New Problems as They Arise
    Gaocheng County Committee Neglects Flood Disaster
    Empirical Leadership Methods Must Be Corrected
    [This Newspaper Reports] Correspondents from the General Branch report: Around July 22nd, Gaocheng County suffered a flood due to the surge of the Hutuo River and Shutao Ditch. Over a hundred villages in the county were affected by the flood. Many fertile fields were covered with thick silt. In deep waters, only the tops of sorghum stalks were visible. Crop yields in some areas were reduced by 70% to 80%. The river surge was swift and fierce. On the south bank of the Hutuo River, the seven-mile-long riverbank from Xiaofeng Village to Shuangmiao was completely submerged, causing widespread flooding. South of the Cangshi Road, an area thirty miles east-west and about ten miles north-south became a marshland. In Xing'an, near the Jinshi Canal, 457 houses collapsed in less than three hours of flooding, with over twenty households losing all their houses. On the north bank of the Hutuo River, the flooded area stretched about thirty miles east-west and about ten miles north-south. Land in seventeen villages was submerged and turned into a sandy waste. At the height of the river surge, the Eleventh District Committee expressed deep concern about the disaster and dispatched a special work team to Gaocheng on the night of the 23rd to assist the county in organizing a flood prevention committee to plug breaches and build dams. Two comrades from the County Government's Industry Department personally supervised the plugging of breaches on Cangshi Road daily. The six-zhang breach in Xing'an has been plugged, but due to insufficient organizational strength, a breach two zhang deep and eleven zhang wide has only been plugged by one chi after three days. Facing a severe flood affecting 40% of the county, the Gaocheng County Committee has not yet invested heavily in rescue and disaster relief efforts. As of the 28th, there was still no comprehensive and thorough plan, let alone effective measures. Efforts were still limited to arranging surveys of the disaster situation and empty preparation work. The focus of the county's work remained on organizational adjustments and the distribution of floating wealth as had been done before the rains. The main forces in the county and districts were still busy running training classes. Five days after the river receded, the County Committee still did not know the full extent of the disaster. Sporadic reports relied on information from village cadres in training. The fifth district was the most severely affected by the flood. When the education assistant of the district went to the county for a meeting, the leadership asked him to report on the flood situation, but he did not know which villages had been flooded. After the flood, the Cooperative Advancement only sent two of its twenty-eight cadres to buy eleven large stones of buckwheat, planning to sell it at fair prices in the market to suppress the rising price of buckwheat seeds. The four agricultural loan officers from Hebei were all working in training classes, and no one was leading production there. The County Committee has not conducted unified and comprehensive research and discussion on disaster relief work. The plan is only to organize the floating wealth of the disaster-stricken villages into sideline occupations and small businesses, and to discuss with Yuhua Store how to lower cotton prices to facilitate the development of the textile industry.
            Editor's Note:
    Regardless of whether it is the slack or busy season, without starting from the actual needs and demands of the peasants, without regard for the life or death of the peasants, always "insisting" on carrying out a set of subjectively prescribed tasks, always adjusting organizations, distributing floating wealth, and running training classes, no matter when or under what circumstances... When people get married, you send gifts to congratulate them; when people celebrate birthdays, you send gifts to congratulate them; now that people have died, you are still sending gifts to congratulate them. This is a manifestation of empirical leadership methods and must be corrected.

    对新发生的问题熟视无睹
    藁城县委忽视水灾
    经验主义的领导方法必须纠正
    【本报讯】总分社记者报导：藁城于上月二十二日前后，因滹沱河、术刀沟洪水暴涨，全县有百余村庄遭受水灾，不少良田淤成厚沙，水深处高粱只露梢顶，年景有的地方减去十分之七、八。此次河水暴涨，来势凶猛，滹沱河南岸之小奉村到双庙七里长的河堤，完全被水漫过，四处泛滥。沧石路以南，东西三十里、南北约十余里的面积尽成泽国。兴安靠近津石运河，见水不到三点钟，即倒房四百五十七间，其中二十多户倒的连一间都没剩。滹沱河北岸水灾面积东西约三十里，南北约十余里。其中十七个村被水淹没之土地，淤成一片沙地。河水暴涨之际，十一地委对灾情表示无限关切，廿三日即派专门的工作队星夜赶赴藁城，协县该县组织防泛委员会，进行堵口打坝。县政府实业科两同志每日亲自督促沧石路的堵口工作，现兴安六丈的决口已堵好，但因组织力量太少，一个两丈深十一丈宽的缺口，堵了三天只堵了一尺宽。面对危及全县百分之四十地区的严重水灾，藁城县委尚未将大力投入抢险救灾工作，直至二十八日还没有一个全盘周密的计划，更谈不到有效的措施。还仅仅停留在布置调查灾情及空洞的准备工作上。全县工作重点仍是下雨前的调整组织与分浮财。县区的主要力量还忙于开办训练班，河水下降五天后，全县受灾详情，县委尚不知道，零星报告，则是依靠受训村干部获得，全县水灾较严重的是五区，该区教育助理员到县开会，领导上要他报告水灾情况，他不知道那村上了水。推进社在水灾后，只在二十八个干部中派出两人买了十一大石荞麦。准备在集上平粜，压低荞麦籽种的涨价。河北四个农贷员则全在训练班工作，那里的生产也没人领导。县委一直没有统一全面的研究和讨论救灾工作，只是在计划把受灾村的浮财组织到副业与小商业中去，和裕华商店商量怎样压低棉价以利开展纺织。
            编者按：
    不管农闲农忙，不从农民的实际需要和要求出发，不顾农民死活，总是“坚持”自己主观规定的一套去进行工作，不管在什么时候，什么情况下，总是调整组织、分浮财、开训练班……人家娶媳妇是送礼祝贺，人家过寿是送礼祝贺，现在人家死人了，仍是送礼祝贺。这是经验主义领导方法的一种表现形式，必须纠正。
