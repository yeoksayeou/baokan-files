    "Don't let a single enemy escape!"
    A Frontline Dispatch from Pingbao
    At 7:00 AM on July 20th, our army's forces attacking Xushui swiftly entered the city, causing the enemy to collapse in disarray. A portion of them concentrated in the southwest corner of the city, attempting to break through the city wall and escape. The Eighth Company of a certain unit of our army, circumventing the city moat from the north bank, arrived at the southwest corner, waiting to completely annihilate the escaping enemy. Comrade Luo, the deputy political instructor of the company, first discovered the enemy jumping off the city wall and immediately informed the troops to concentrate their fire. However, the enemy, disregarding their lives, continued to roll down from the city wall and flee towards the northwest. Deputy Political Instructor Luo shouted, "Don't let a single enemy escape!" He was the first to jump across the city moat. The brave warriors of the Second Platoon of the company also followed closely and quickly jumped into the river. The river water was very deep, in some places reaching the necks of the soldiers. Soldiers who could not swim held onto the guns of those who could swim, crossing the south bank of the river. Platoon Leader Xu Baoxi lost his shoes while pursuing the enemy, his feet covered in thorns, but he didn't even bother to brush them off. Xu Baoxi led the Second Squad, chasing for five *li* in one breath, capturing four enemies alive and seizing a heavy machine gun. Warrior Lü Xiaoyin of the Fifth Squad ran the fastest, barefoot. While running, he shouted, "Lay down your weapons and you will not be killed!" and captured over a dozen enemies at once. In the end, not a single one of the forty or so enemies who attempted to break out escaped.

    “不让敌人逃跑一个！”
    平保前线通讯
    七月二十日上午七时，我军总攻徐水部队，迅速打入城内后，敌人溃乱了，有一部集中到城西南角，企图跳城突围。我军某部八连，从护城河北岸，绕到西南角，等着全部歼灭突围的敌人，该连罗副指导员，首先发现敌人跳城，立即告诉部队，集中火力射击。但敌人仍是不要命的从城墙上滚下来，向西北面跑去。罗副指导员高喊着：“不让敌人逃跑一个！”他首先跳过护城河。该连二连的桂战士们，也紧跟着迅速的跳下河去，河水很深，有的地方没过战士的脖子，不会浮水的战士，牵着会浮水的战士的枪，渡过河南岸，一排长保喜，追击敌人时掉了鞋子，脚上刺满了蒺莉，也顾不着用手拂一下。徐保喜带着二班，一口气追了五里地。生俘了四个敌人，缴获了一挺重机枪，五班战士吕小银，光着两只脚，跑得最快。一边跑一边喊：“交枪不杀。”一下俘虏十来个敌人。最后，企图突围的四十多个敌人，一个也没有跑掉。        （李文田）
