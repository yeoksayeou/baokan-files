    [Taiyue Telegram] Land reform in Jincheng has been thorough. Since this spring, the correction of "leftist" deviations has been implemented, and the enthusiasm for production among all social strata has increased, with many people adding to their livestock. Last winter, the county had 18,245 head of livestock. By August 10th of this year, it had increased to 21,091 head (materials from 43 administrative villages are still lacking), an increase of 2,846 head in eight months. The main reasons for the increase in livestock are the compensation for the losses of wrongly criticized middle peasants during the correction of deviations, and the disbanding of the "Three Combinations" mutual aid teams which were forcibly organized and harmed the interests of livestock owners. All social strata understood our party's policies and actively purchased livestock. According to a survey in the Fifth District, middle peasants bought 379 head of livestock, poor peasants bought more than 40 head, and original landlords bought 9 head. Secondly, the smooth flow of goods within the liberated area, and the fact that the masses made a lot of money running errands and transporting goods, also stimulated the masses to buy livestock. Of the more than 500 livestock added in the Fifth District, 490 were bought with money earned from transporting goods. The government's policy of deducting one-third of the purchase price in the burden-sharing method, and promoting breeding and reproduction, has also greatly stimulated the increase in livestock. After Xiaozhang Village implemented the new deduction method for burden-sharing this summer, it added 19 head of livestock. Dazhang Village also added 12 head. With wheat planting season approaching, the masses are continuing to actively find ways to purchase livestock in preparation for use during wheat planting.

    晋城各阶层纷纷买牲口
    【太岳电】晋城土改已经彻底，自今春以来，又贯彻了纠正左偏，各阶层生产情绪提高，纷纷添买牲口。去冬全县有牲口一万八千二百四十五头，至今年八月十日已增至二万一千零九十一头（还缺四十三个行政村材料），八个月增加了二千八百四十六头。增加牲口主要的原因，是纠偏中补偿了错斗中农的损失，和解散了强迫编制的损害有牲口户利益的“三合”互助组。各阶层了解了我党政策，纷纷添买牲口。据五区调查，中农买了牲口三百七十九头，贫农买了四十多头，原地富买了九头。其次是解放区内货物畅流，群众跑脚运货赚钱很多，也刺激了群众买牲口。五区增加的五百多牲口，有四百九十头是运货赚钱买下的。政府在负担办法上扣除买价三分之一，提倡配种繁殖，也大大刺激了牲口的增加。小张村今夏按新扣除办法负担以后，就增加十九个牲口。大张村也增加了十二个。快种麦了，群众还在继续积极设法购买牲口，准备种麦时使用。
