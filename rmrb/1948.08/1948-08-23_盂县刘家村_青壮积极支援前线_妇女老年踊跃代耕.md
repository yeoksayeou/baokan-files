　　Meng County, Liu Village

　　Young and Middle-Aged Men Actively Support the Front Lines
　　Women and Elderly Enthusiastically Farm on Their Behalf

    [North Yue News] In Liu Village, Yu County, 16 long-term civilian laborers and stretcher bearers set out in early June. The whole village has 182 households and 167 able-bodied laborers. At the end of July, another 34 civilian laborers and stretcher bearers were transferred, bringing the total number of villagers supporting the front to 50. The day after the second group of civilian laborers left the village, it was raining heavily. Village cadres Huai Lin, Wang Laibao, and Liu Shangren actively led an emergency meeting of rear production cadres before the rain stopped to review the past farming on behalf of the civilian laborers and discuss future methods of farming on their behalf. Huai Lin proposed: "Fifty of our village's young and middle-aged men have gone to the front to fight in Taiyuan. Their production depends entirely on our elderly, women, and children. We must handle it as if it were our own business." Elder Zhao Xishuo said, "Although I am old and cannot go to the front, I will guarantee that farming on behalf of production in the rear is done well." Some said, "The main task now is to quickly plant buckwheat and vegetables. The elderly must lead the women and children in production, otherwise the work will not be done well." Under the active leadership of elders Zhao Xixiao, Liu Caixiao, Wang Lisuo, and others, 11 experienced farmers including Dai Zhenlu, who is strong, took on the leadership of the rear, saying, "At this time, we must work as if we were young." Women's committee members Zhang Baoliang, Shang Qiulian, and Wang Qiaolan selected 15 active women with good labor skills to participate in the rear production leadership. Children's cadre Yin Shuangquan and others also selected 73 children who were able to work in the fields to organize production (out of a total of 115 children in the village).
    In order to facilitate labor recording and to earnestly help the families of civilian laborers with production, Elder Zhao Xixiao and others specifically managed all the tasks of the civilian laborers' families, allocated labor according to needs, and reported work and allocated labor to the logistics committee member and deputy squadron leader every evening, recorded work based on the amount of farming done on their behalf, such as assigning one work point per mu of land tilled, and converting miscellaneous labor and animal labor according to the situation, and settling accounts once a month. In order to ensure that the families of the civilian laborers do well, two methods were adopted: one was to allocate labor for production and assign close relatives of the civilian laborers to lead the farming on their behalf, and the other was to assign cadres during the allocation of labor for production to lead and farm on their behalf, and to ensure that whatever work was needed was allocated so that the families of the civilian laborers would not be delayed in any way. The day after civilian laborer Wang Jinyuan set off, Zhao Linxiao, a poor peasant, dug pits for him to make fertilizer and planted more than one mu of jade corn seedlings according to his production plan, and hoed and tilled them, recording two work points. Elders Zhao Xixiao, Dai Zhenlu, and others went door-to-door every evening to arrange the tasks for the families of the civilian laborers. When civilian laborer Zhao Erliang's family ran out of coal, the old man Xixiao immediately sent his son to carry his own coal to provide for burning. Under their leadership, the elders in each street solved the difficulties of the families of civilian laborers in terms of coal, drinking water, and burning soil, and made a concentrated effort to quickly plant, hoe, and till, giving priority to the families of those at the front. For example, at the beginning of August, the entire meeting of elderly and women production cadres checked and found that the 16 civilian laborers who had been away for two months and the 34 short-term civilian laborers and stretcher bearers had been away for five to seven days, and a total of 222 work points had been allocated for production (including 55 women's work points and 26 children's work points). In order to reassure the civilian laborers at the front, the cadres sent a letter to the front, informing them of the situation of farming on their behalf and comforting them.

　　盂县刘家村
  　青壮积极支援前线
  　妇女老年踊跃代耕
    【北岳讯】盂县刘家村群众，六月初长期民工担架出征者一六名，全村一八二户，整劳力一六七个，七月底又调走民工担架三十四名，全村支前民工达五○名。第二批民工出征离村第二天，正在普降大雨，村干部怀林、王来保、刘尚仁积极领导，雨未停便召集了后方生产干部的紧急会议，检查过去对民工的代耕，及讨论今后代耕的办法。怀林提出：“咱们村五十名青壮年已到前方去打太原，他们的生产就全靠咱们老年、妇女、儿童来干，咱们就得和自己的事情一样办才行”。老年赵喜小说：“我虽年老不能到前方，后方代耕生产我要保证办好”。有的说：“现在主要是耧大团抢种荞麦、菜的营生，带领妇女儿童生产必须有老年领上才行，不然营生做不好”。在赵喜小、刘才小、王里锁等老年积极带头下，全村劳动强的老农戴贞禄等十一名负担后方的领导，他们说：“这时候咱们才要当年青的干哩”。妇女委员张保良、尚秋连、王巧兰，选拔了劳动好的积极妇女十五名也参加了后方生产领导。儿童干部尹双全等也选拔了儿童内能够下地生产的七十三名组织生产（全村儿童一一五名）。
    为了记工齐工的方便与认真帮助民工家属生产，老年赵喜小等专门掌握民工家属的一切营生，根据需要进行拨工，每日晚上向后勤委员、副中队长报工，拨工，记工；按代耕营生多少评工记帐，如一般规定耧地一亩计一工，杂工与牲畜工根据情形折合，每月一次齐工算帐。为了使民工家属的营生做好，采取了两种办法：一种是拨工生产配备民工亲近家属领上代耕，一种是在拨工生产中配备干部，一面领导，一面代耕，并做到需要什么工就拨什么工，不使民工家属受到任何耽搁。在民工王金元出征后第二天，就按照他的生产计划由贫农赵林小给他打坑制肥奶玉茭苗一亩多，并给锄耧过，记工两个。老年赵喜小、戴贞禄等每天晚上排门择户按置民工家属的营生，民工赵二亮家没有了煤子烧，喜小老汉马上打发他儿将自己的煤子担去供烧。在他们的带领下，各街老年都解决民工家属煤、吃水和烧土困难，突击抢种锄耧都做到先给前方家属生产。如八月初全体老年、妇女生产干部会议检查，全村出征两月的民工一六名和短期民工担架三四名离五天至七天的时间，共拨生产工二二二个（内有妇女工五五个，儿童工二六个）为使民工前方安心支前，干部给前方寄信一封，告诉代耕生产情形，进行了安慰。
