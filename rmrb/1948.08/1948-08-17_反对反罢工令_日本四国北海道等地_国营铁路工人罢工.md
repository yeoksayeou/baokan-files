　　Opposing the Anti-Strike Order
  　National Railway Workers in Shikoku, Hokkaido, and Other Parts of Japan Go on Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Reports from various sources: Strikes by Japanese workers against the anti-strike order have first broken out among national railway workers in Shikoku and Hokkaido. As early as the second day after the anti-strike order was announced (August 1st), national railway workers in Nagano and several prefectures in Shikoku collectively went on strike, causing the suspension of train services on twenty-one lines. On the 7th, when Japanese Cabinet Secretary-General Yoshizo Tomabechi and Police Headquarters Director-General Saito Noboru threatened violators with "dismissal" and "relentless police action," railway workers in Matsuyama, Shikoku, went on strike due to excessive work caused by changes in the train timetable. That evening, 100 armed police officers arrested ten members of the railway workers' strike committee. By the 9th, 150 locomotive drivers in Matsuyama had refused to work in protest of the arrest of eleven drivers two days prior. On the 10th, some drivers in Hiroshima refused to go to the Matsuyama railway depot to replace the strikers, declaring that they would not be "strike breakers." The Hokkaido locomotive drivers' strike on the 9th had caused the suspension of one passenger train and six freight trains. Prior to this, the National Federation of Trade Unions Liaison Committee of Japan issued a statement on the 3rd demanding the immediate resignation of the Ashida Cabinet. Leaders of the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions on the same day accused the MacArthur Headquarters and the Allied Council for Japan, pointing out that the anti-strike order violated the Potsdam Declaration. A delegation of Japanese public employees' unions recently visited the Allied Council for Japan, solemnly requesting that the anti-democratic actions of the occupying authorities and the Japanese government be made known to the people of each member state of the Allied Council, and demanding that measures be taken to prevent the fascization of Japan.

    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方报导：日本工人反对反罢工令的罢工，已首先在四国和北海道两地国营铁路工人中爆发。还在反罢工令宣布之第二日（本月一日），长野和四国若干县的国营铁道工人就集体旷工，使二十一线火车停驶。七日，当日本内阁书记官长苫米地义三与警察本部长官齐藤升以“开除”及“无情地采取警察行动”，威胁违令者的时候，四国的松山铁路工人，因反对改变火车时间表所引起的过度工作而举行罢工。当晚武装警察百人逮捕了铁路工人罢工委员会委员十人。迄九日止，松山的机车司机一百五十人已拒绝作工，以抗议两日前十一名司机的被捕。十日，广岛的若干司机拒绝到松山铁道停车站接替罢工者的工作，声称不作“破坏罢工者”。九日北海道机车司机的罢工，曾使客车一班与货车六班停开。前此，日本全国工会联络委员会于三日发表声明，要求芦田内阁立即辞职。日本产业劳动组合联合会领袖于同日指责麦克阿瑟总部和盟国对日委员会，指出反罢工令是违反波茨顿宣言的。日本公务员工会代表团最近访问盟国对日委员会，郑重申请将占领当局及日本政府的反民主行动，告知对日委员会各会员国的人民，并要求采取阻止日本法西斯化的措施。
