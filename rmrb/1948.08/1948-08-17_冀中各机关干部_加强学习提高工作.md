(Jizhong Electric) Since July, a study movement has been universally launched in various organs and troops in Central Hebei to deeply discuss the Party Central Committee's instructions on the work guidelines and tasks for 1948, and to review the undesirable phenomena of lack of organization and discipline. The district party committee, the administrative office, and the units directly under the military have generally implemented a two-hour study system, making rough readings, detailed readings, and discussions of the four study documents stipulated by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Many comrades have also made notes in connection with personal reflection. Organs such as the administrative office have corrected the idea of antagonism between study and work, and have listed study as one of the administrative routine work. In studying the documents, many comrades have realized the necessity of strengthening organization and discipline in order to welcome the national victory, and have begun to check personal and departmental work in connection with reality. After studying "Lenin on How Soviet Officials Should Work," the Finance Department of the Administrative Office linked it to the specific situation of the department and discussed scientific work methods and systems. After studying the documents, some comrades in the editorial department of the Jizhong Guidance News reflected on shortcomings such as delays, sloppiness, and carelessness in their work, as well as liberalism and enjoyment thinking; they proposed concrete plans to improve work such as "finish today's work today." The county party committees of Shenxian, Qingyuan, Renhe, Suning, Hejian, Wuqiang, Ningjin and other counties arranged for cadres to study and held tests. The tests proved that the cadres' understanding of the policies was still vague. In Shenxian County, 96 percent of the cadres in various organs failed the test, and the average score of the county was only 33 points. Some departments averaged only 14 points. After the test, the enthusiasm of the cadres for learning was greatly stimulated. When the cadres of the Jin Gao Irrigation Canal Management Committee studied the documents, they reviewed the actual work and found that there were shortcomings such as insufficient accuracy in design, sloppy accounts, and chaotic management of materials. Subsequently, various systems and improvement plans were formulated. After studying the documents, the cadres of the Hejian County Government reviewed the shortcomings in their work, such as fatigue and sloppiness, and proposed to use documents such as Lenin's "On How Soviet Officials Should Work" as a regular standard to compare themselves against. Everyone took notes, and each department made a work plan every half month to ensure timely completion. Now, the work efficiency of the agency has been significantly improved.

　　冀中各机关干部
  　加强学习提高工作
    【冀中电】七月份以来，冀中各机关部队普遍展开学习运动，深入讨论党中央关于一九四八年工作方针与任务的指示，检讨无组织无纪律的不良现象。区党委、行署及军直各单位，一般都执行了两小时学习制，对中共中央宣传部所规定的四个学习文件作了粗读、精读和讨论。并联系个人反省，好多同志作出笔记。行署等机关纠正了学习与工作对立的思想，把学习列为行政日常工作之一。在学习文件中，很多同志认识到为了迎接全国胜利，加强组织性纪律性的必要。并开始联系检查个人及本部门的工作。行署财政应学习了“列宁论苏维埃机关人员如何工作”后，即联系本部门具体情况，讨论出科学的工作方法和制度。冀中导报社编辑部有些同志学习文件后，反省了工作中的拖延、草率、粗枝大叶等缺点，以及自由主义、享受思想等；提出“今天的事今天做完”等改进工作的具体计划。深县、清苑、任河、肃宁、河间、武强、宁晋等县县委，布置了干部学习，并举行测验，从测验中证明了干部对政策认识上还很模糊。深县各机关干部测验中不及格的占百分之九十六，全县平均分数仅为卅三分多，有的部门仅平均十四分，经过测验，大大刺激了干部们学习的积极性。晋藁灌溉渠管委会干部学习文件时，联系实际工作进行检讨，检讨出设计上的精确性不够，帐目马虎，管理器材混乱等不良现象。随后便订出各种制度及改进计划。河间县政府干部学习文件后，检讨了工作中的疲踏、潦草等缺点，并提出把列宁论苏维埃机关人员如何工作等文件作为经常对照自己的标准，人人作笔记，各科半月作一次工作计划，保证按时完成。现该机关工作效率更显著提高。
