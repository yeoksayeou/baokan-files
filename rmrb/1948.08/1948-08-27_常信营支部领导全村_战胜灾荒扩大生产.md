　　【Jizhong Electric】The Changxinying Branch in Zhao County, with its members uniting all classes, has intensified production. The village has a total of 552 households and 7,042 mu of land, of which only 4,680 mu are cultivable. After the incident, in addition to enemy disasters, it also suffered three consecutive years of drought, and the people's lives were extremely difficult. Last year, 84 households could not make ends meet, and the whole village was short of an average of half a year's worth of grain. At that time, the branch proposed "do whatever you can, and support yourself with your own hands." It called on every household to collect yam leaves and radish stalks, dry them and mix them with food, and organized the masses to help each other. Party member Zhang Zhenjiang led 33 families who made a living by weaving willow wares to implement mutual aid, earning 540 catties of grain per day. The branch also promoted women cadres Jia Chung'e and Liu Shuge (party member) to organize women's textile mutual aid, so that all 300 spinning wheels and 82 looms in the village were put into operation. According to statistics, 11 households relied on textiles to maintain their lives throughout the year, and 197 households could solve five months of their lives. Under the leadership of the branch, last year's disaster was also overcome in this way.

　　During the spring plowing this year, the village was carrying out land reform. Landlords and old rich peasants were not at ease farming, middle peasants were also unsure, and poor peasants lacked livestock, farm implements, and seeds. The branch then suggested to the new farmers' association that the livestock confiscated and requisitioned from landlords and old rich peasants should first be lent to the masses for planting; the farmers' association was responsible for solving the problem of who did not have seeds among the poor and middle peasants. In this way, the entire village planted spring seedlings and eliminated the fallow land. During the land reform, the village branch conscientiously implemented the policy of protecting industry and commerce and uniting with the middle peasants. A middle peasant household that had been wrongly classified before was reclassified; a noodle shop belonging to a rich peasant that had been confiscated was returned. Village cadres and party members also went to each household to explain the Party's policy towards middle peasants and the policy towards industry and commerce to the masses. The middle peasants said, "This way, a stone can be put down."

　　After the land reform, most of the waterwheels distributed to the peasants were broken, and the masses urgently needed repairs. The branch then organized a discussion among the masses, used 150 trees of floating wealth as capital, and organized six carpenters and three blacksmiths to open a metal and woodworking factory to repair waterwheels, make hammer well plates, and drill well eyes, and proposed that regardless of class, anyone whose waterwheel was unusable could have it repaired, and pay later in the autumn if they had no money now, and the hammer well plates that were made were lent to those who dig wells. To reward those who dig new wells, a well plate is given to whoever digs a new well. The factory started work on January 26th, and as of April 26th, it had repaired 48 waterwheels, and waterwheels that had been lying in the field for nine years were also turning again. Now the factory has switched to manufacturing agricultural implements, spinning wheels, and looms. In order to solve the problem of capital for poor women to spin thread, and to save women the time of going to the market to exchange cloth, the village organized a textile cooperative, responsible for supplying raw materials and selling finished products. Now the whole village has freely combined six textile groups (21 people). For agricultural loans, the branch also found someone to take charge, conducted a detailed review, organized 71 households, formed 8 groups, and has now dug 8 new wells and hammered 5 old wells.

　　Due to the active leadership of the branch, the peasants in the village have a high enthusiasm for production, and put down their work in the fields to weave and spin. There are no idlers in the village. The village branch also plans to plant willows on the 24 hectares of land that have not grown crops for fifty or sixty years and develop the willow weaving industry.

　　常信营支部领导全村
  　战胜灾荒扩大生产
    【冀中电】赵县常信营支部，党员团结各阶层加劲生产。该村共五百五十二户，七千零四十二亩地，其中能种的只有四千六百八十亩。事变后除遭敌灾外，又连遭三年旱灾，人民生活极苦。去年就有八十四户揭不开锅，全村平均差半年的粮食。当时，支部就提出“能干什么干什么，用自己两手养活自己”。号召各家采山药叶萝卜梗等晒干掺着吃，并组织群众互助。党员张振江领导了三十三家以编柳货为生的实行互助，每天可赚五百四十斤粮食。支部又推动妇女干部贾春蛾和刘淑阁（党员）组织妇女纺织互助，使全村三百辆纺车和八十二张织布机都转动起来。据统计，依靠纺织维持全年生活者十一户，能解决五个月生活者一九七户。在支部领导下，去年的灾荒，也是这样战胜的。
    今年春耕时，村里正搞土改。地主与旧富农不安心种地，中农心里也没底子，贫农缺牲口、农具、籽种。支部便向新农会建议，把没收和征收地主、旧富农的牲口先借给群众种上地；贫中农谁没有籽种，农会负责解决。这样全村都种上了春苗，消灭了熟荒。土改中，该村支部认真执行了保护工商业与团结中农的政策。以前错订了一户中农，改订了；没收了富农一座挂面铺，退回了。村干部和党员并挨户向群众解释党的中农政策与工商政策。中农们说：“这么着，可把一块石头落了地了。”
    土改后，农民分得的水车，大部都坏了，群众迫切需要修理。支部便经过群众讨论，用浮财一百五十棵树作资本，组织了六个木匠、三个铁匠开了个铁木工厂，修理水车、造锤井版、打井眼，并提出不分阶层，谁的水车不能用都可修理，现在没钱，秋后再还，打出的锤井版，贷给打井户使用。为奖励打新井，谁打新井送给一个井盘。工厂正月二十六日开工，截至四月二十六日止，修理了四十八辆水车，有扔在地里九年的水车也转动起来。现在工厂已转业造农具、纺车、织布机。为了解决贫苦妇女纺线本钱，和节省妇女赶集换布时间，村里组织了纺织合作社，负责供给原料，推销成品。现在全村已自由结合了六个纺织小组（二十一人）。对于农贷工作，支部也找出专人掌握，经过详细审查，组织了七十一户，结成了八个组，现已打新井八眼、锤旧井五眼。
    由于支部积极领导，该村农民生产情绪很高，放下地里的活就是编织、纺线。村里没有了二流子。该村支部还计划把五六十年不长庄稼的二十四顷地扎上柳子，开展柳编业。
