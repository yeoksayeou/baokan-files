　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: News from various sources: The bumper harvest in Eastern Europe this year has allowed Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary and other countries to greatly increase their grain rations. The Czechoslovakian government is even considering abolishing the rationing system for bread and flour. The Romanian government has stipulated that bread rations will be increased from the 1st of this month, and the price of bread will be reduced to 14 lei per kilogram. The bread ration for miners and other heavy laborers has thus been increased to a high level of one kilogram per day. The Hungarian government has also ordered an increase in flour and bread rations starting from the 15th. Harvesting is proceeding smoothly in all three countries. According to statistics from the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Agriculture, as of August 8th, 80.4 percent of the country's grains had been harvested. According to an announcement by the Hungarian Central Supply Bureau, as of August 8th, 27,493 carloads of grain had been stored in warehouses nationwide, exceeding the plan by more than 20 percent. Romania's grain delivery plan is being implemented successfully. Poor peasants have played an active role in preventing rich peasants from evading grain delivery and hiding grain, ensuring the smooth implementation of the grain delivery plan.

　　东欧今年丰收
  　捷罗匈提高粮食配给
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：东欧今年的丰收，已使捷、罗、匈等国的粮食配给大为提高，捷克政府甚至已在考虑取消面包和面粉的配给制。罗马尼亚政府则规定自本月一日增加面包配给量，并减低面包价格至每公斤十四个罗币。矿工及其他从事重劳动的工人，面包配给量因此已增至每天一公斤的高额。匈牙利政府亦下令于十五日起增加面粉与面包配给量。三国收获均顺利进行中。据捷克农业部统计，截至本月八日止，全国谷物已收割了百分之八十点四。据匈牙利中央供给局宣布，截至本月八日止，全国入仓谷物已达两万七千四百九十三车箱，超过计划百分之二十以上。罗马尼亚纳粮计划正在成中，贫农在制止富农逃避纳粮与埋藏粮食方面起了积极作用，保证了纳粮计划的顺利实现。
