　　Railways Run Smoothly in Remote Areas
  　New Achievements in Soviet Railway Construction and Electrification
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st Dispatch] TASS reports: The Soviet Union has achieved new successes in railway construction and electrification. This year's railway construction has increased by one-third compared to last year. The railway from Moscow to the North Caucasus has been re-laid with double tracks, totaling 1,300 kilometers, facilitating the transportation of Donets coal and other freight. The newly built Sosva-Alapayevsk railway (both in Sverdlovsk Oblast) passes through the swamps of the northern Urals, connecting important industrial centers in the Urals with other regions. The railways from Stalinsk (in southern Novosibirsk Oblast) to Barnol (in northern Altai Krai), and from Akmolinsk (northern Kazakhstan) to Pavlodar (northwestern Kazakhstan) are under construction. These two routes should be one of the major trunk lines passing through Siberia, the Urals, and the Volga River, and are the shortest routes for transporting coal, copper, oil, timber, and other materials. The restoration work of the Donets Basin railway is proceeding on a large scale. In the first two and a half years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, many previously unknown branch lines and small stations have been transformed into large-scale stations and railway intersections. During the post-war Five-Year Plan, 1,000 kilometers of railway are electrified each year. The electrification plan is centered on the 2,350-kilometer-long Ural-Siberian trunk line. This will be the longest electrified railway in the world. The first batch of electrified locomotives on the Transcaucasian Railway carry much heavier loads than before, but are twice as fast as steam locomotives. The electrified railway extends northward to the coast of the Barents Sea. In Ukraine, a new 400-kilometer electrified railway is under construction from the Krivoy Rog iron ore basin to the Donets coalfield and southern steel factories. Note: According to the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will build 7,230 kilometers of new railways (including the 3,600-kilometer-long southern Siberian trunk line) and electrify 5,325 kilometers of railways.

　　穷乡僻壤铁路畅通
  　苏联铁路建设与电气化获新成就
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社讯：苏联铁路建设与铁路电气化获得新的成就。今年铁路建筑比去年增加三分之一。从莫斯科到北高加索的铁路已改铺双轨，全长一千三百公里，便利于顿尼兹煤的运输及其他货运。新筑的索斯瓦——阿拉帕耶夫斯克（均在斯维德洛夫斯克省）铁路，经过乌拉尔北部的沼泽地，把乌拉尔重要工业中心和其他各地连接起来了。从斯大林斯克（在新西伯利亚省南部）至巴诺尔（在阿尔泰边疆北部），从阿克莫林斯克（哈萨克斯坦北部）至巴夫洛达（哈萨克斯坦西北部）的铁路正在建筑中。这两段路线应为经过西伯利亚、乌拉尔和伏尔加河的大干线之一，是运输煤、铜、石油、木材等最短的路线。顿尼兹盆地铁路恢复工作正在大规模进行中。在战后五年计划的头两年半中，原来很多不知名的支线和小车站已变为大规模的车站和铁路交叉点。战后五年计划中，每年均有一千公里铁路电气化。电气化计划以二千三百五十公里长的乌拉尔——西伯利亚干线为中心。这将是全世界最长的一条电气化铁路。外高加索铁路第一批电气化火车头所运的煤，比以前重得多，但却比蒸气火车头快二倍。电气化的铁路在北部一直伸展到巴伦支海边，在乌克兰从克里伏伊罗格铁矿盆地至顿尼兹煤田及南部钢铁工厂的四百公里新的电气化铁路正在建筑中。按：根据五年计划，全苏将建筑新铁路七千二百三十公里（其中包括三千六百公里长的西伯利亚南部干线），并使五千三百二十五公里铁路电气化。
