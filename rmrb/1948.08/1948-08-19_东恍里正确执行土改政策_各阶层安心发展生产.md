　　Donghuangli Correctly Implements Land Reform Policy
  　All Strata Develop Production with Peace of Mind
    [Our Dispatch] In Donghuangli Village, the seventh district of Anguo, due to the correct implementation of the Party's land reform policy and attention to combining land reform with production, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has greatly increased this year, promoting the rapid development of agricultural production in the entire village. The village has a total of 235 households and 1,106 people (including 601 women). Last year there were only three mutual aid groups, but this year has seen the development of 13 groups, with 44 households, often helping each other with labor. More than 30 women participate in major field labor, more than double the number from last year. Hongqiao, a young woman, whose father is sick, manages the family's 12 mu of land entirely with her mother. Sun Luocheng's wife, who is over sixty years old this year, has also learned to hoe the ground and drive a cart. They voluntarily formed twelve textile groups, and in addition to participating in field production, they have been spinning thread and weaving cloth since the first day of the first month, solving the problem of clothing. Young woman Yanzhe said: "In the past, I felt ashamed to go to work in the fields, but this year I feel very honored." Poor peasant Cui Manchang had a piece of land along the south of the village that had not grown crops for several years. This year, he plowed it twice, applied fertilizer twice, and weeded it four times. Now the sorghum is more than a meter tall and has become the village's number one crop. Li Jingui is a military dependent who did not have anyone to cultivate the land for him, but he managed his crops very carefully. Other people's wheat generally yielded a little over five dou, while his wheat yielded one shi and one dou. Well-to-do middle peasant Li Jinsheng's family of four cultivated sixteen mu of land. This spring, he sent his son to join the army, and his wife participated in labor. Landlords and rich peasants, understanding the Party's policies, have also actively engaged in production. Landlord Cui Luoguan, who is sixty years old, picks up more than two baskets of manure every day. Rich peasant Li Shutong and his wife are learning to blacksmith and have become blacksmiths. From land reform to the present, the village has increased by 18 livestock (including 13 purchased from the proceeds of seized property), six large carts, three weaving machines, and more than twenty spinning wheels. Seven large carts regularly transport goods to Shijiazhuang. There is a new sweet potato starch noodle maker, thirteen bean sprout producers, two tofu sellers, eight Chinese medicine material cutters, twelve small vendors, two flour millers, and two blacksmiths.

    Due to the increased enthusiasm for production, the unhealthy atmosphere that had existed in the village for many years has also been suppressed. The village used to have bad customs, including gambling and theft. Crops were constantly stolen, and young trees could not grow. This year, the whole village collectively planted 62 mu of tree saplings, and very few were damaged or trampled. Currently, all eight idlers and lazybones in the village have been reformed. There is no more theft or gambling in the village.

    The situation of the village's correct implementation of land reform and attention to combining land reform with production is roughly as follows:

    1. Resolutely implement the Party's instructions and do not expand the scope of struggle. The village extracted a total of 271 mu of land, which was distributed to 80 landless and land-poor peasants (including 14 middle peasants), accounting for over 34 percent of the total village population. At the beginning of January, when the Party instructed to correct incorrectly determined class statuses, the four middle peasants who had been wrongly designated as landlords and rich peasants were resolutely and quickly corrected, and all their belongings were returned to them. During land reform, the principle of focusing on solving the land problem was grasped. From the beginning of December last winter to the spring equinox, the land was distributed to households. The amount of land received by each person was roughly equal. Landlords received an average of 2.5 mu of land per person, equivalent to a wealth index of 2.1; rich peasants received an average of 3.2 mu of land per person, equivalent to a wealth index of 2.2; middle peasants received an average of 3.1 mu of land per person, equivalent to a wealth index of 2.7; and poor peasants received an average of 2.9 mu of land per person, equivalent to a wealth index of 2.3.

    2. The work team discovered that production had been somewhat neglected in the early stages of land reform, and in mid-January, they proposed the method of "meetings at night, production during the day," and explained at the branch general meeting that land reform was intended to enable everyone to produce well, get rich, and live a good life. Party members were required to take the lead in setting an example and to publicize and explain this to the masses. During land distribution, it was emphasized that "lazy people must be educated and forced to produce." The middle peasants were mobilized household by household to rest assured and send manure for production. At that time, some people provoked trouble by saying, "Whoever earns money will have their name shouted in the streets." The leadership immediately exposed this vile behavior that hindered production and stabilized the emotions of the peasants.

    3. Publicize the Party's policies and create an atmosphere that "production and labor are glorious." Well-to-do middle peasant Li Jinsheng labored very well, so the peasant association cadres publicized that his land would definitely not be touched. Labor-good peasants were constantly praised at meetings and on the radio. People who had been lazy in the past were urged when they met each other. For example, "The edge of the field should be repaired!" "The manure should be sent!" "Everyone says you are lazy, you should try to prove yourself!" and so on.

    4. Gradually organize everyone on the principle of freedom and voluntariness. After the land was redistributed, mass meetings were held continuously, calling on everyone to organize mutual aid to solve difficulties. Li Zhenjiang (village government secretary) first united several suitable people to form a factory work group. Li Jintai, who was 57 years old, also formed a group with Sheng'er and Li Siping (widow). Jintai cultivated eight mu of land for Siping, and Siping weaved cloth and made clothes for his family. In order to develop mutual aid groups, the village also decided to take turns sending people from the mutual aid groups to perform duties, instead of sending them all together, so as not to affect the production of the entire group. Everyone (especially the poor peasants) saw that mutual aid could solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power, so they followed and organized themselves.

    5. Convene women's forums to explain that in order to achieve true equality between men and women, one must produce well and improve one's social status. The radio called on everyone to learn from Li Qiao'er (widow), a production activist. The women activists in the land reform, led by Sun Xiaoqiao, were mobilized to go to the fields. Gradually breaking the erroneous ideas that women are ashamed to labor and that women cannot work in the fields, the concept of labor being glorious was established, and thus the number of women who went to the fields to work gradually increased.

　　东恍里正确执行土改政策
  　各阶层安心发展生产
    【本报讯】安国七区东恍里村，由于正确执行了党的土改政策，并在土改中注意了与生产的结合，今年群众生产积极性大大提高，促进了全村农业生产的迅速发展。该村共二三五户，一一○六人（内妇女六○一人）。去年只有三个互助组，今年发展到十三组，四十四户，经常互助拨工。参加田间主要劳动的妇女有三十多人，超过去年一倍。青年妇女红桥的爹有病，她与母亲全部经营了全家的十二亩地。孙洛诚的老婆今年六十来岁，也学会了锄地、赶车。她们自愿组成了十二个纺织组，除参加田间生产外，正月一日起纺线织布，解决了穿衣问题。青妇彦哲说：“往年下地干活还觉害臊，今年很觉光荣。”贫农崔满常在村南沿有一块地，好几年不长庄稼了，今年耕了两次，上了两次粪，锄了四遍，现在高粱长的有一人多高，成了全村头号庄稼。李金贵是个军属，没用人代耕，庄稼经营得很周到。人家的麦子一般打五斗多，他的麦子打一石一。富裕中农李进生家四口人种十六亩地，今春送子参了军，他老婆参加了劳动。地主富农由于了解了我党政策，也积极生产起来。地主崔洛罐六十岁了，每天拾两筐多粪。富农李树同家两口子学着打铁，当起了铁匠。从土改至现在，全村增加了十八个牲口（内有十三头是从浮财变款中买的），六辆大车，三张织布机，二十多辆纺车。有七辆大车经常到石家庄跑运输。新增了一家拔丝的，十三家发豆芽的，两户卖豆腐的，八家切药材的，十二户小商贩，两户磨面的，两户打铁的。
    由于生产情绪提高，村里多少年来的邪气也压下去了。该村过去乡俗不好，又是赌博，又是偷盗，庄稼不断被偷，小树也长不住；今年全村集体栽了六十二亩地的树秧，很少被损坏糟踏的。现全村八个二流子懒汉皆被改造，村中没了偷盗，没了赌博。
    该村正确实行土改和在土改中注意与生产结合，情形大致如下：
    一、坚决执行党的指示，不扩大斗争面。全村共抽出二七一亩地，分配给了八十户无地少地的农民（内有中农成份十四户），占全村总户口百分之三十四强。一月初党指示叫纠正错定成份时，坚决迅速的改正了四户被错定为地富的中农，并全部退还了他们的东西。土改中掌握了以解决土地问题为主的方针，从去冬十二月初开始，至春分前，即将地分配到户。各户每人所得土地大致相等。计地主每人平均土地二亩半，折合富力二点一个；富农每人平均土地三点二亩，折合富力二点二个；中农每人平均土地三点一亩，折合富力二点七个；贫农每人平均土地二点九亩，折合富力二点三个。
    二、工作组发现土改初期对生产有些忽视，一月中便提出了“黑夜开会，白天生产”的办法，并在支部大会上说明土改就是为了使大家好好生产，发家致富过好光景，党员要带头起模范作用。要求党员向群众作宣传解释。分地中强调了“懒汉必须实行教育与强制生产”。对中农则挨户动员他们放心送粪生产。当时有些人挑拨说：“谁挣了钱就给他在街上嚷。”领导上马上揭露了这种阻碍生产的恶劣行为，安定了农民情绪。
    三、宣传党的政策，造成“生产劳动是光荣”的空气。富裕中农李金生劳动很好，农会干部就宣传决不动他的土地。在开会时和广播时不断表扬劳动好的农民。对过去懒惰的人，大家见了面就督促他。比如“地阶子该修了”“粪该送了！”“大家谁都说你懒，你也争个气！”等等。
    四、在大家自由自愿的原则下逐步组织起来。土里抽补后，即连续开了群众会，号召大家组织互助，解决困难。李振江（村政府秘书）首先团结了几个合适的人组成一个厂工组。李金台五十七了，他也与声儿、李四平（寡）三家组成了一个组。金台给四平种着八亩地，四平给他家织布作衣。为了发展互助组，村中又议定轮流派互助组的人出勤务，不要一齐派，以免影响全组生产。大家（特别是贫农）见到互助能解决人力畜力困难，就跟着组织起来了。
    五、召开妇女座谈会，说明要想男女真正平等，只有自己好好生产，提高自己的社会地位。在广播上号召大家向生产积极分子李巧儿（寡妇）学习。发动土改中的妇女积极分子孙小桥领头下地。逐步打破了妇女以劳动为耻与认为妇女不会下地劳动的错误思想，树立了劳动光荣的观念，因而妇女下地劳动者便逐渐增多。
