　　He Who Plants the Wheat, Reaps the Harvest
    To the Editors:
　　Jia Laotun, a poor peasant from Pingtou Village, Fourth District, Gaoping County, married a woman this spring. This woman's previous husband has been away for over ten years, and his whereabouts are unknown. Later, Jia Laotun and this woman requested to marry. With the consent of the village cadres and the approval of the district office, the wife brought all of her property to Jia Laotun's home (her first husband's family has no one left). However, when Jia Laotun was about to harvest the wheat, the village cadres suddenly came out to stop him, saying: "The land belongs to her first husband, and the wheat belongs to him too. You are not allowed to harvest it!" Why doesn't the border government's proclamation of "he who plants, reaps" apply in Pingtou Village? Are the village cadres' actions correct? Please answer.
　　
　　Feng Chuan
    △ Answer: It is incorrect for the village cadres to prohibit Jia Laotun's family from harvesting the wheat, because the wheat was planted by Jia Laotun's wife. However, regarding the land ownership, if the village has implemented land reform, the land belonging to her former husband should be returned to the farmers' association for safekeeping.

　　麦子谁种由谁收
    编辑同志：
    高平县第四区平头村贫雇贾老吞，今春娶了个老婆。这个女人的前个男人已出外十来年，如今不知存亡。后来贾老吞和这女人要求结婚，经村干们同意，区署也批准了，这个老婆便将所有的财产，全部带到了贾老吞家（其头个男人家没一个人了）。但当贾老吞要割麦的时候，村干突然出来阻止，说：“地是她头个男人的，麦子也是人家的，不准你收！”边府谁种谁收的布告为何在平头村行不通？村干的做法对不对？请答。　　　
　　冯川
    △答：村干禁止贾老吞家割麦子，那是不对的，因为那麦子是贾老吞的老婆所种。不过土地所有权，如该村已实行土改，则其前夫份内的土地，应交回农会保留。  　　　　　　　　　　——编者
