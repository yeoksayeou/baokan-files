　　Branch Strengthens Leadership, Rationally Organizes Manpower:
  　　Dianshang Overcomes Labor Difficulties

　　[North Yue News] Dianshang Village, Meng County (including Zhao Jiagou Village attached outside), has a total of 39 households with 177 people and more than 377 mu of land. After deducting those who joined the army, those who are away, and the disabled laborers, there are only 30 young adults over the age of 18 in the village, and 23 people are serving corvée (why are the other 7 not serving? Is it possible that some of them should be serving but are not? Worth checking - Editor). There are three militiamen who have been working with the army on the front lines since the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. Among the nine military families, except for Zhao Er and Zhang Youren, who do not need to be cultivated on their behalf because they have labor, the rest must be cultivated on their behalf. The village is located on the main road connecting Dingxiang and Xin County, with a large mountain behind the village. It is twenty miles across the mountain to reach the next village. Troops and cadres often come to the village for a break, and there are many things to do. Each laborer in the village serves an average of eight to nine workdays of corvée per month, and in May, each person averaged thirteen workdays (including corvée workdays and cultivation workdays). Despite so much attendance, production is very good. The strong leadership of the Communist Party branch and the scientific and rational organization of labor are the main reasons for achieving this result.

　　In terms of supporting the front and cultivating on behalf of military families: the village adopted "three methods and one system." One method is year-round contracting: the land to be cultivated on behalf of military families is assessed according to mu, and the work is fixed and contracted to the mutual aid team. The mutual aid team is responsible for the whole year from cultivation to harvest. The workdays of those cultivating on behalf are offset against corvée. Another method is temporary allocation of labor to help the families of departing migrant workers and military families who cannot catch up with the labor force for a while. The third is mass allocation of labor and squeezing in time for quick strikes. At critical junctures of agricultural work, most people are mobilized to cultivate on behalf of military families and migrant workers first. If there is not much work, everyone squeezes in a morning or an early morning for a quick strike, which can be completed quickly. The "equal value accounting and monthly accounting" system is implemented in these three methods. For example, each mu of contracted land is equivalent to twelve workdays. From April to September, it is calculated on a six-month basis, and two workdays per mu are deducted from the corvée account each month. Among the nine military families in the village, three have contracted land, and in addition to cultivating some by themselves, they contracted out a total of twelve mu to four mutual aid teams. This was done with the consent of the military families and the mutual aid teams, with the team leaders responsible for careful cultivation.

　　Supporting the front and cultivating on behalf are implemented with work-point assessment and accounting. After the migrant workers supporting the front return, work points are calculated according to the number of workdays on the service certificate issued. After deducting the workdays used for cultivating on their own behalf and the corvée workdays that should be shared each month, the remaining workdays are the actual workdays they have earned. For example, Zhang Meihe (militia) served ten workdays supporting the front in April and a total of fifty-two workdays from the fifth day of the fifth lunar month to June 27. The village cultivated forty-one workdays on his behalf, and after deducting the eighteen corvée workdays that each person should share for two months (each person averages eight to nine workdays of corvée per month), he had a surplus of three corvée workdays when settling accounts on June 27. This calculation can ensure fairness in work-point accounting between the front and the rear, and everyone is satisfied.

　　During mass allocation of labor, women and children who can work go to the fields together. Due to the different size of the labor force and the different amount of work done, a reasonable discounted work-point system is implemented, with full work-points topping ten points and decreasing in turn.

　　Squeezing in time in the mornings or early mornings is generally done by adopting the method of mutual aid and sending work, and no work-points are calculated. On the morning of June 23, sixteen people weeded more than one mu of small millet seedlings for Zhao Laixi (migrant worker), and on the early morning of the 27th, eighteen people weeded more than three mu of foxtail millet for Zhang Sanwa (military family member and militia). Everyone said that this was like "putting two oil lamps on a tile basin," doing it incidentally. Everyone gets a burst of enthusiasm, and the corvée workdays saved are still for everyone, anyway, the wool comes from the sheep. ("Sending work" is okay in small villages and is completely voluntary among the masses. It is worth studying whether it is generally promoted - Editor)

　　Corvée workdays are accounted for on a monthly basis, and who has a surplus and who owes is calculated clearly, so no one has any doubts in their minds. As soon as cultivation on behalf or stretcher transport to the front is mentioned, there are no delays. Mass allocation of labor or squeezing in time for quick strikes is not like in some villages, where they have to gather everyone before leaving. Instead, a few cadres take the lead, and while calling out "Let's go! Hey!", they quickly walk to the designated location, saving a lot of time waiting for people.

　　The village has had a foundation of labor cooperation for more than four years. For example, the mutual aid teams of Zhang Fu, Zhang Jinyuan, Zhao Wenyan, and Zhao Baoshan have persisted for more than four years and are still doing well. Today, cooperation and mutual assistance in production have become a common habit of the masses in the village. This year, some poor peasants organized three groups and jointly borrowed grain from the cooperative to use sheep to lie on the wasteland and planted more than ten mu of wheat. The masses in the village generally cooperate in raising pigs, sheep, and cattle. Among the eighteen households raising cattle, five are half-feeding. Among the thirty households raising sheep, fourteen are half-feeding. In the beginning, some people raised cows that gave birth to calves, but they were unwilling to sell them and could not afford to raise them. On the other hand, some poor households wanted to raise cattle but did not have the money to buy them, so both parties adopted a cooperative feeding method (i.e., half-feeding). The cattle owner provides the cattle, and the other party manages the feeding and bears the cost of hiring (two dou of grain per cow per year, half price for calves). The two families share the calves born. Raising sheep is also done in the same way. Dianshang Village has developed livestock breeding rapidly using this method. In 1937, there were only four cattle in the village. In 1943, there were eight. In 1945, it reached twenty. In 1946, it increased to twenty-two. In 1947, there were twenty-six. This year, it reached twenty-nine. Among those raising pigs, there were only four households in 1937. In 1945, the cooperative half-fed four sows. By 1946 and 1947, pig raising had developed to twenty-six households. In 1946, there were nine sows and one boar in the village. One year, one hundred twenty to thirty piglets were sold. The number of pigs decreased due to the famine last autumn, and now there are only nine. The number of sheep increased from eighty-six in 1943 to two hundred thirty-eight this year. The diligent and cooperative atmosphere of the whole village fully demonstrates the new atmosphere of harmony, unity, and production among the peasants after the land reform.

　　In the past, the leadership of the Communist Party branch in Dianshang Village was relatively strong. Since the Party members became public, most Party members have been able to play an active role. The cooperative committee led by cooperative hero Zhao Zhong organizes production and supports the front more specifically. For example, the issue of cultivating on behalf of migrant workers was studied and solutions were found early in the spring plowing season, so when the task of supporting the front arrives, they can complete the work calmly. Recently, after the district held a meeting to arrange the work of pressing green manure, the village conveyed the information that night and started taking action the next day.

　　支部加强领导合理组织人力
  　店上克服劳力困难
    【北岳讯】盂县店上村（附村赵家沟在外）共三十九户，一百七十七口人，土地三百七十七亩多。除去参军的、在外的和残废的劳力，村里十八岁以上的青壮年只有三十人，服勤务的二十三人（另七个人为什么不服勤务，是否其中有应服而未服的？值得检查——编者）。有三个民兵，自阴历五月初五出征，至今仍在前线随军工作。军属九户中除了赵二和张有仁两户因为有劳力用不着代耕外，其余都得代耕。该村位于通定襄、忻县的大路上，村后一座大山，过山二十里才有村庄。来往军队和干部常到村里打尖休息，事情特别多。该村每个劳力每月服勤务八个到九个工，五月份每个人平均到十三个工（勤务工连代耕工在内）。出勤这么多，生产搞的却很好；共产党支部领导的强，劳力组织得科学合理，是获得这种成绩的主要原因。
    在支前代耕方面：该村采取了“三种办法、一个制度”，一种办法是常年包耕：把军属应代耕的土地，按亩斟酌定工，固定包给变工组。从耕种到秋收负责全年。代耕工照数抵销勤务。另一种是临时拨工，帮助劳动力一时赶不上的出征民工和军属。第三是大拨工和挤空突击。在农作紧要关头，发动多数人先给军属、民工代耕，如工活不多，大家就挤个晌午或早晨突击一阵，很快就能完了。在这三种办法中，贯彻着一个等价计工按月算帐的制度。如包耕每亩地折合十二个工，从四月到九月按六个月算，每月在勤务帐上按亩扣除两个工，全村九户军属中有三户包工的，除自己耕种一部外，共包出十二亩，包给四个变工组。这都是取得军属和变工组的同意，由变工组长负责，精耕细作。
    支前和代耕实行评工计工。支前民工回来后，按发给的勤务证工数计工，再扣除本身用了的代耕工和每月应摊的勤务工，即成自己实得工数。如张梅和（民兵）四月份支前十个工，五月初五至六月二十七共服五十二个工，两次共六十二工。村里给他代耕四十一工，再扣除两个月每人应摊的十八个勤务工（每月每人平均服勤务工八个至九个），在六月二十七日算帐时，他长了三个勤务工，这种计算能保证前后方计工公平，大家都满意。
    大拨工是妇女儿童能劳动的一起下地。因劳动力大小不同，干活多少不等，实行合理的按分折工，整工顶十分依次递减。
    挤晌午或早晨突击，一般是采取了互助送工的办法，都没有计工。六月二十三日早晨十六个人给赵来喜（民工）锄完小黍苗一亩多，二十七日清晨早十八个人给张三娃（军属又是民兵）锄完大谷三亩多，大家都说这是“担瓦盆搁了两个油灯”，捎着办，大家发阵热，节省下勤务工还是大家的，反正羊毛出在羊身上。（“送工”办法在小村且出于群众完全自愿是可以的。一般提倡还值得研究——编者）
    勤务工坚持一月一算帐，谁长谁欠都计的一清二白，谁心里也没有一点含糊。一说代耕或到前方担架运输，都没有推延。大拨工或挤空突击也不象某些村庄那样，非集中齐了不走，只是几个干部带头，一面招呼“走呀！艾”，一面很快走到指定地点，省了不少等人的工夫。
    该村在劳动合作方面已有了四年多的基础，如张福、张金元、赵文彦、赵宝山的变工组，一直坚持了四年多，到现在还搞的很好。到今天合作互助进行生产，已成了该村群众的普遍习惯。今年有些贫农组织了三个组，合伙向合作社借粮用羊卧荒地，种了麦十亩多，该村群众普遍合作养猪、养羊、养牛，十八户养牛的有五户是半喂，三十户养羊的有十四户是半喂。开头有人养母牛下了小牛，不愿卖又养不起，另一方面有些贫苦户想养牛没钱买，双方就采取合作饲养的方式（即半喂），牛主出牛，对方管理养喂和负担牛的雇佣费（每牛每年谷二斗，小牛半价），生下小牛两家平分，合养羊也是同样办法，店上村用这种方法，畜养发展很快。一九三七年全村只有四头牛，一九四三年有八头，一九四五年达到二十头，一九四六年增至二二头，一九四七年有二六头，今年达到二九头。养猪的在一九三七年仅有四户，一九四五年，合作社半喂了四口母猪，到一九四六、一九四七年养猪的发展到二十六户。一九四六年全村有九个母猪一个公猪，一年就卖出了一百二、三十只小猪，去秋闹灾荒猪减少了，现在只有九个。羊由一九四三年的八十六只增到今年的二百三十八只，全村勤劳合作的情绪，充分表现出土改后农民们和谐团结生产的新气象。
    过去店上村共产党支部的领导就比较强。自从党员公开以后，大多数党员都能表现积极的作用。合作英雄赵忠领导的合作委员会，更具体组织生产支前。如民工代耕问题，还在春耕开始的时候，就及早的研究了办法，所以支前任务到来，都能不慌不忙的完成工作任务。最近的压绿肥工作，区里召开的布置会刚完，村里当晚就进行了传达，第二天就开始行动起来。（赵长城、高晋材）
