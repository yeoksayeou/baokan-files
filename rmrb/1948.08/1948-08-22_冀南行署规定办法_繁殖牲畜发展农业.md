　　Jinnan Administrative Office Regulations
  　Breeding Livestock to Develop Agriculture
    [Jinnan News] For the past ten years, livestock losses have been extremely heavy due to enemy disasters and natural calamities. Furthermore, some areas have seen deviations in conscript labor and substitute farming, with unreasonable practices such as having middle peasants bear more conscript labor, calculating labor based on trips rather than days, unequal value exchange of labor, or forcing households with cattle to provide excessive substitute or assisted farming, causing dissatisfaction among middle peasants or households with cattle. Manure has decreased with the reduction of livestock, affecting the recovery and development of agricultural production. In order to protect and encourage the increase of draught animals, thereby promoting the development of agricultural production, the Jinnan Administrative Office has formulated four measures: First, regarding burdens and conscript labor, all draught animals are exempt from burdens, and the conscript labor system is strictly enforced to conserve and save animal power; breeding animals are exempt from labor duties. Those engaged in both draught animal work and mating services may be granted appropriate reductions or exemptions from labor duties; those who specialize in transporting livestock are not subject to conscript labor. Pregnant female animals are exempt from labor duties for two months before and one month after birth, and are not required to perform long-distance labor within six months after birth. Newly purchased livestock (excluding those bought after being sold) are exempt from labor duties for three months from the date of purchase, and young animals with only one pair of teeth are exempt from labor duties. According to the Land Law Outline, the livestock purchased independently or jointly by landlords and rich peasants with their labor income are not subject to equal distribution. Draught animal loans should be listed as an important item in agricultural loans, and the government should provide loan support to poor farmers lacking cattle and to cooperatives and merchants with successful livestock trading records. Rural or urban gatherings should expand livestock markets or specifically organize mule and horse fairs, providing various conveniences for merchants and cooperatives engaged in livestock trading. Strictly enforce the ban on slaughtering draught animals: all livestock capable of cultivation are strictly prohibited from being slaughtered. Old, sick, or disabled animals must be inspected and approved by the district-level government or higher before they can be slaughtered. Second, vigorously breed livestock and reward public and private breeding of stud animals. Each county and city can purchase stud bulls and donkeys (public farms can also do the same), with the construction section responsible for entrusting insiders or reliable households to feed and mate them. The government will reward those who breed livestock. Stud animals are generally not allowed to be used for work and are used exclusively for mating. If a household continuously raises a stud animal for two years, the stud animal becomes the property of the feeding household. When allocating stud animals, each stud bull will be loaned with 400 jin of rice and 200 jin of seeds, which will be deducted from the government's award rice in the future. Broadly call on cooperatives and individuals to raise seeds. Third, strengthen livestock maintenance and prevent diseases; governments at all levels should promptly collect various treatment and prevention methods and promote and introduce them to the masses. Strengthen education for veterinary personnel.

　　冀南行署规定办法
  　繁殖牲畜发展农业
    【冀南讯】十年以来，因敌祸天灾，牲口损失奇重。又因某些地区在支差代耕上发生了一些偏向，不合理的让中农多支差，出差论趟不论天，不等价计工换工，或强制有牛户过多的代耕助耕等，引起中农或有牛户不满。粪土随着牲畜的减少而减少，使恢复与发展农业生产受到影响。为了保护与奖励增殖耕畜，以利发展农业生产，冀南行署特规定四项办法：第一、在负担与支差等方面，规定一切耕畜不纳负担，严格支差制度，爱惜与节省畜力，种畜免除差役。耕畜兼营交配业者，得酌情减免差役，专门贩运牲口者不支差。怀胎之母畜，产前两个月、产后一个月免除差役，产后六个月内不出长差。新增购的牲畜（卖后又买者除外），从购买之日起免除三个月差役，幼畜在一对牙内者免除差役。土地法大纲公布贫，地富以劳动所得，独购或伙买之牲畜不平分。把耕牛贷款列为农业贷款的重要一项，对贫苦缺牛农民及贩运牲畜有成绩之合作社与商贩，政府应酌予贷款支持。农村或城市集会应扩大牲口市，或专门组织骡马大会，对贩运牲畜的商民、合作社，予以各种便利。严格执行禁宰耕畜法令：凡有耕作能力的牲口，一律不准宰杀。老病残废者，须经区以上政府检验批准后方得宰杀。第二、大力繁殖牲畜，奖励公、私喂养种畜。每县市可购置种牛种驴（公立农场亦可照办），由建设科负责委托内行人或可靠户喂养交配。政府予繁殖牲畜者以奖励。种畜一般不准使活，专门用于交配。一户连续喂养二周年者，该种畜即为喂养户所有。分配种畜时，每一种牛借给饲养米四百斤，种子二百斤，将来从政府奖米中扣还。广泛号召各合作社和私人喂养种子。第三、加强牲畜保养，防预疾病，各级政府应及时多方搜集治疗预防方法，在群众中推广与介绍。对兽医人员，应加强教育。
