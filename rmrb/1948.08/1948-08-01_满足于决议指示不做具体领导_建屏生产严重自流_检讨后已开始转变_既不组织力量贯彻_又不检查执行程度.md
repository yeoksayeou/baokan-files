[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] A reporter from the General Branch reported: During the recent heavy rain, the chairman of the Jianping County People's Representative Conference (the entire county People's Representative Conference was originally scheduled to be held, but the representatives did not arrive due to the rain), after listening to the government's report on not having given sufficient attention to production work in the first half of the year, once again raised the issue of leading the county's people in large-scale production to the top priority of the county's work. At the same time, it pointed out that in Jianping, a completely old liberated area where land reform has been thoroughly carried out, production should be the central task of the entire county in the long term, both now and in the future. It also specifically studied issues such as "organizing the entire people for production," "how to develop the entire county's people's sideline occupations," "how to overcome disasters and practice thrift," and "how to issue agricultural loans with a focus on production," and resolved to issue a call for production and thrift to the entire county's people in the name of the representative conference. This measure of attaching importance to production from the leadership level and raising production to the top priority of the county's leadership work is completely correct. However, a very good plan, resolution, or call will fall through if it cannot be specifically organized and implemented, and the degree of execution is not inspected at any time. Thinking of these things, the reporter flipped through the resolutions of the second People's Representative Conference held in Jianping in March and the resolutions of the third conference held in early June, and found that the county's People's Representative Conference had already discussed production work twice. In particular, the resolution of the second representative conference, if it could be truly implemented, would definitely produce good results. However, when the reporter compared these resolutions with the production situation understood from various sources, especially after meeting with comrades from below, he felt that there was a considerable gap between the two. Comrade Wang, who returned from investigating agricultural loans in the Third District, said: The district also discussed and conveyed the county's resolutions on production work each time, but after the discussion and conveyance, no one paid any attention to them anymore, and they were often forgotten due to the arrival of other work. For example, regarding agricultural loans, the county and district had discussed and arranged on principled issues such as "using them with a focus" and "must be used to develop production," but according to the investigation of several typical villages in the Third District this time, agricultural loans were still distributed evenly, which was equivalent to issuing relief rice, and production was not truly organized. In Laofengou Village in the Third District, out of 43 households, only three households did not receive loan grain, and many households averaged only two catties of grain per person. The result of issuing agricultural loans in this way cannot play a role in supporting production at all; on the contrary, it has promoted waste in many places. For example, in Wanzi Village in the Third District, Kong Erhe, who does not engage in proper work, lost 60 catties of cotton and a mule in gambling. This time, he received 250 catties of grain for livestock loans, used 159 catties to buy half a mule, and ate 55 catties, and then gambled away the mule again. The county and district have never inspected these situations. When it comes to the county's agricultural and sideline production, comrades in the Industry and Commerce Section are very worried. Since the beginning of spring, no major responsible cadre in the county has been specifically responsible for leading production. Although the county chief also served as the director of the Promotion Society, he did not actually vigorously lead production. In fact, the only ones who really worked were the Industry and Commerce Section. They said: If the main cadres of the county and district do not promote it, how can the Industry and Commerce Section organize and promote the party, government, and civilian cadres below to lead production? Feng, the head of the Industry and Commerce Section, said: The county has been making calls and resolutions, but the lower levels are still doing their own thing: determining class status and distributing spoils. He cited an example: The First District is located in the Hutuo River basin, and the county specifically equipped the First District with a water conservancy assistant to lead the masses in building water conservancy projects. Since taking office, the water conservancy assistant has been dividing class status and spoils in the village, and has not managed water conservancy matters at all. He said: This year, agricultural production in the entire county has fallen into drift in many places. Some time ago, during the drought, Deputy County Chief Han said: This year, the farmers of the entire county have a great interest in engaging in sideline production, and this has its objective reasons. Jianping County has a population of more than 100,000 and a total of 180,000 mu of irrigated and dry land, averaging 1.7 mu per person. In the mountainous areas, each person averages only 1.2 mu of land. Even in normal years, vigorously developing sideline production in Jianping is a very important part of improving the people's lives. The First, Second, Third, and Sixth Districts are developing transportation, the First and Fourth Districts are developing textile, and the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Districts have good conditions for digging medicinal materials and raising livestock. When Jianping was drought-stricken last year, the entire county vigorously organized sideline occupations to overcome the famine. The county organized a materials exchange committee and a poor people's store to vigorously organize disaster victims to transport materials, which solved great difficulties for the masses. It is a pity that the experience of organizing sideline occupations to overcome the famine was not well absorbed during this summer's drought prevention. This spring, the Industry and Commerce Section also organized the masses to transport materials for a period of time. In the Sixth District's 17 villages and the Fifth District's 12 villages alone, they earned more than 42 million yuan in 46 days, but it was not done again afterward. In early June, the various districts of Jianping were already very dry. The county Industry and Commerce Section drafted an instruction on drought prevention and famine preparedness, but it was stopped because it was feared that it would hinder the wheat requisition at that time and it was necessary to study how to combine it with other work (at that time, the lower levels were still determining class status and distributing spoils). It was not until more than ten days later, after receiving the special district's instruction on drought prevention and famine preparedness, that an instruction was issued, but cadres were still not organized to lead it.
Although the County Industry and Commerce Section also directly sent cadres to the district and villages to guide some production work, such as carrying out typical village work in Guanyintang Village in the First District, issuing agricultural loans and organizing the masses to produce and overcome the famine, were all good. It is a pity that it was not promoted. In the Hutuo River basin, they directly sent people to the villages to resolve the masses' water conservancy disputes. The comrades who went to the Fourth District organized the unified use of water in small canals, the Fifth District organized sheep lying on the ground, and the Second and Seventh Districts loaned to purchase the masses' medicinal materials, all of which achieved certain results. These all show that as long as it is based on the specific conditions and requirements of the masses, and there is an organized leadership force, production work can be completely done well. Jianping leaders have repeatedly proposed guaranteeing the cultivation on behalf of military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, and civilian workers supporting the front lines, and the districts have also achieved considerable success in this regard.
Why can't good production resolutions be implemented? In addition to the difficulties given by the county comrades' proposed expansion of the army, wheat requisition, support for the front lines, and cadre problems (one-third of the county's more than 250 cadres are vacancies and sick numbers, and two-thirds of the sick numbers have ideological problems), the reporter also specifically studied with the responsible comrades of the county party committee, mainly because the leadership only made arrangements, and did not have the arduous and meticulous organization force to implement them. For example, the county's third People's Representative Conference discussed wheat requisition and production after the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee put forward the policy of unity and production in the People's Daily editorial, and after Comrade Peng Zhen emphasized the report of "the party committee should spend half of its time leading production" at the cadre meeting of the Beiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee, this conference specially conveyed Comrade Peng Zhen's report, but the spirit has not yet been transformed. The county party committee did not vigorously organize manpower to lead production. Comrade Zhang Jilin, the county secretary, said: At several county party committee meetings, everyone did not have a good in-depth discussion on the arrangements for production, and the ideological opposition of the county's cadres to engaging in production has not been overcome. Regarding this issue, Captain Han only said: "Because production is a long-term central task, everyone regards it as incidental."
In this way, only being busy with meetings, decisions, and instructions, but not organizing forces to implement them, and not inspecting them, is a serious bureaucratic style of work, and ignoring the party's instructions and calls is worthy of Jianping County Party Committee's deep review.
This Jianping People's Representative Conference spent half a day specifically discussing the county's production work, which is good, and we warmly hope that this resolution that meets the needs of the masses can be quickly put into practice.

    满足于决议指示不做具体领导
    建屏生产严重自流
    检讨后已开始转变
    既不组织力量贯彻
    又不检查执行程度
    【本报特讯】总分社记者报导：建屏县人民代表会主席（原定召开全县人民代表会，因下雨代表没有赶来），在此次大雨中，听取了政府前半年没有很好重视生产工作的报告后，再一次把领导全县人民大生产的问题，提到全县工作第一位。同时指出：完全是老区、土改已经彻底的建屏，现在和将来的长远时期中，生产都应该是全县的中心工作。并具体的研究了“全民组织起来生产”、“如何开展全县人民的副业”、“如何渡过灾荒厉行节约”、“如何有重点的发放目的为了生产的农贷”等问题，决议以代表会名义，向全县人民发出生产节约的号召。这种从领导上来重视生产，把生产提高到全县领导工作第一位的措施是完全正确的。但是，一个很好的计划、决议、号召，如果不能具体组织力量贯彻执行，并随时检查执行的程度，便会落空。记者想到这些，又翻阅了建屏三月召开的第二次人民代表大会的决议及六月初第三次大会的决议，发现该县人代会已经两次讨论了生产工作。特别是第二次代表大会的决议，如果真能贯彻执行，一定会发挥良好的效果。可是，当记者把这些决议与各方面了解的生产情况，特别是和来自下边的同志晤谈之后，就感到两者之间，存在着不小的距离。从三区调查农贷工作回来的王同志谈：县里每次关于生产工作的决议，区里也照样作了讨论和传达，但讨论传达之后，就再也没有人过问了，且常因别的工作到来又把它忘记了。如象农贷，县区在“有重点的使用”、“一定要用到发展生产上去”等原则问题上，都作过讨论和布置，但根据这次三区几个典型村的调查，农贷还是平均分配，等于发救济米，并未真正组织生产。三区老坟沟四十三户人家中，只有三户未领到贷粮，有不少户平均到每个人身上只合二斤粮食。这样发农贷的结果，根本不能起到扶植生产的作用，相反，不少地方还助长了浪费。如三区湾子村，不务正业的孔二和，赌输六十斤棉花、一头骡子，这次他又领到牲畜贷粮二百五十斤米，用一百五十九斤买了半个骡，吃掉五十五斤，骡子又赌输了。这些情形县区都从未检查过。提到全县的农副业生产，实业科的同志都非常发愁。入春以来，县里主要负责干部，没有一个人专门负责领导生产，虽说县长兼了推进社主任，但实际上并未大力领导生产。实际上真正作的，就只有实业科了。他们说：县区主要干部不推动，实业科哪能组织推动下边党政民干部去领导生产呢？实业科冯科长说：县里一直在作号召决议，下边还是在干他自己的：订成份分浮财。他举了一个例子：一区位于滹沱河流域，县里专为一区配备一个水利助理员，领导群众兴修水利。该水利助理员自到职以来，一直就在村里划成份分浮财，根本未管水利的事情。他说：今年全县的农业生产在很多地方就这样陷入自流了。前些时天旱，韩副县长说：今年全县农民进行副业生产的兴趣很大，这是有他客观原因的。建屏全县十万零五千多人口，共有水旱地十八万来亩，平均每人一亩七分多地。在山区每人则只平均一亩二分来地。就在平年，建屏大力发展副业生产，也是提高群众生活极重要的一部分。一、二、三、六区在发展运输，一、四区发展纺织，二、四、五、七区刨药材和牲畜上，都有很好的条件。去年建屏天旱时，全县大力组织副业渡荒，县组织了物资交流委员会和贫民店，大力组织灾民运输，解决了群众很大的困难。可惜的很这一组织副业渡荒的经验，今夏防旱中未能很好吸取。今年春天实业科也曾组织群众运输了一个时期，仅六区十七个村，五区十二个村，四十六天中即赚钱四千二百多万元，以后再也没有作了。六月初，建屏各区已经很旱了，县实业科草拟了一个防旱备荒指示，结果因怕妨碍当时麦征，并要研究与其他工作如何结合在当时下边还正在订成份、分浮财），就停了下来。直到十多天后，接获专区防旱备荒指示后，才下了一道指示，但仍未组织干部力量去领导。
    虽然县实业科也直接派了干部到区村去指导了部分生产工作，如象他们在一区观音堂村进行了典型村工作，发放农贷和组织群众生产渡荒，都是好的。可惜的是没有推广。在滹沱河流域地区，他们直接派人到村，解决了群众的水利纠纷。到四区的同志，组织小渠统一使水，五区组织羊卧地，二、七区贷款收买群众药材等，都收到一定的成绩。这些都说明：只要根据群众的具体条件和要求，并有领导的组织力量，生产工作是完全能够搞好的。建屏领导上历次提出保证军、干、烈属、支前民工的代耕问题，在各区这一点也是收到相当成绩的。
    为什么很好的生产决议不能贯彻下去？除了县里同志们提出的扩军、麦征、支前以及干部问题（全县二百五十多个干部，三分之一是缺额病号，病号中三分之二是闹思想病的）给予的困难外，记者又专门同县委负责同志研究过，主要是领导上只作了布置，没有艰苦细致的组织力量去贯彻。如该县第三次人民代表大会讨论麦征生产时，是华北中央局在人民日报社论中提出团结生产方针以后，也是彭真同志在北岳四地委干部会上强调提出“党委要拿一半的时间去领导生产”的报告之后，这次会上对彭真同志的报告作了专门传达，但在精神上还没有转过来。县委并未大力组织人力去领导生产。县书张吉林同志说：在几次县委会上对于生产的布置，大家也未很好的展开深入讨论，全县干部对闹生产的思想，也未打通。对于这个问题，韩队长只是说：“生产因为是长年中心工作，因此大家就看成附带的了。”
    似此，只忙于开会、决定、指示，而不去组织力量贯彻实现、也不检查的作风，是严重的官僚主义作风，忽视党的指示与号召，这是值得建屏县委深刻检讨的。
    建屏这次人民代表会议，用半天时间专门讨论了全县生产工作，这是好的，我们热望着这个适合群众需要的决议，能够迅速见诸实行。
