Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. As the Kuomintang government's military and political crises deepen and its financial and economic situation approaches total collapse, it announced on the 19th the "Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Disposal," implementing a so-called "currency reform" to conduct a new, more blatant, and more barbarically shameless plunder of the people through a disguised, larger-scale currency inflation. The main content of the Kuomintang government's "currency reform" is to issue a total of 2 billion counterfeit Gold Yuan notes to replace the current legal tender (fabi) and Northeast circulation notes, stipulating that 3 million fabi can be exchanged for one counterfeit Gold Yuan note, with the exchange to be completed before November 20th this year. The total issuance of 2 billion counterfeit Gold Yuan notes is equivalent to a staggering 60 trillion fabi, a tenfold increase over its own announced issuance of 6 trillion, but according to general estimates, Chiang Kai-shek's total fabi issuance is at least over 120 trillion, making it at least a fivefold inflation. The counterfeit Gold Yuan notes are divided into five denominations: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Calculating at 3 million fabi for one counterfeit Gold Yuan, a 100-yuan counterfeit Gold Yuan note is equivalent to a 300 million fabi note, actually a sixty-fold increase compared to the original highest denomination of 5 million fabi (equivalent to 250,000 Customs Gold Units). Therefore, this "currency reform" is essentially a disguised large-scale currency inflation. The Kuomintang reactionaries are using this large number of non-redeemable counterfeit Gold Yuan notes as a tool to plunder the limited wealth of the people under their rule on a larger scale, extracting their marrow and sucking their blood.
Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's greedy plunder doesn't stop there. In the so-called "Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Disposal," in addition to the "Measures for Issuing Counterfeit Gold Yuan Notes," the following measures were also announced: (1) "Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People," stipulating that gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currencies are prohibited from circulation, sale, or possession in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and stipulating that one tael of gold can be exchanged for 200 counterfeit Gold Yuan, one tael of silver for 3 counterfeit Gold Yuan, one silver coin for 2 counterfeit Gold Yuan, and one US dollar for 4 counterfeit Gold Yuan, forcing the people to exchange them at the bogus Central Bank before September 30th. In other words, this so-called "Gold Yuan note" is completely non-redeemable, unable to be freely exchanged for foreign currency or silver coins, and the silver, nickel, and copper coins supposedly to be issued are also replaced by the equally worthless "auxiliary currency notes," essentially "exchanging one piece of paper for another," forcibly seizing gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency from the people. (2) "Measures for Registration and Management of Assets Deposited Abroad by the People," stipulating that all assets deposited abroad by the people before August 20th, exceeding 3,000 US dollars, must be declared and registered before the end of December this year. This indicates that the foreign assets of all other classes of people besides the four major families will be arbitrarily confiscated by the Kuomintang reactionary group. (3) "Measures for Rectifying Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls," stipulating adjustments to various taxes according to pre-war standards; freezing wages, abolishing cost-of-living indexes, etc. This indicates that workers, staff, and all salaried employees in the Kuomintang areas will be plunged into an even more painful abyss of hunger; industrial and commercial circles will suffer heavier taxes and levies. The articles of this measure also stipulate that during the implementation of the "Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Disposal," "lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns are prohibited," attempting to suppress the workers' resistance to their hunger policy and deprivation policy through fascist violence.
It can be clearly seen that the Kuomintang reactionary government's so-called "currency reform," as well as the various measures announced in connection with it, are all Chiang's gang's last struggles at the end of the road. Apart from causing larger-scale malignant inflation, higher price increases, deeper financial and economic crises, and inciting broader and stronger resistance from the vast masses of the people to accelerate the end of its traitorous and anti-people rule, it will have no other result.

　　穷途末路最后挣扎
  　国民党政府“改革币制”
    发行伪金元券更加野蛮掠夺人民
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】国民党政府在其军事、政治危机愈益深刻，财政经济濒于全面总崩溃之际，于十九日公布“财政经济紧急处分令”，实行所谓“改革币制”，以变相的更大规模的通货膨胀，对人民进行新的、更露骨的、更野蛮无耻的掠夺。国民党政府“改革币制”的主要内容，是发行总额二十亿元伪金元券，来代替现在的通货法币和东北流通券，并规定以三百万元法币折合伪金元券一元，于今年十一月二十日前兑换完毕。二十亿元伪金元券的发行总额，折合法币达六十万亿的惊人数目，较其自己宣布的发行总额六百万亿实为增发十倍的空前大膨胀，但据一般估计，蒋介石的法币发行总额最少当在一千二百万亿以上，则最少亦是膨胀五倍，伪金元券票面共分一元、五元、十元、五十元、一百元五种，如以法币三百万元折合伪金元券一元计算，一张一百元的伪金元券，便等于一张三亿元的法币，实际上较原来法币五百万元（二十五万元关金折合）的最高票面，增加达六十倍之巨。因此，这次“改革币制”，实质上是变相的通货大膨胀。国民党反动派即以此大量的不兑现的伪金元券为工具，更大规模地敲骨吸髓地掠夺其统治下的人民有限的财富。
    蒋介石匪帮贪婪的掠夺还不止此，在所谓“财政经济紧急处分令”中，除“伪金元券发行办法”之外，还公布了以下几种办法：（一）“人民所有金银外币处理办法”，规定禁止黄金、白银、银币及外币在国民党统治区流通、买卖或持有，并规定黄金一两兑伪金元券二百元，白银一两兑伪金元券三元，银币一元兑伪金元券二元，美金一元兑伪金元券四元，强制人民于九月三十日前向伪中央银行兑换。换一句话说，这所谓“金元券”是毫不兑现的，既不能自由兑换外币，也不能兑换银币，而所谓准备发行的银、镍、铜币、也就为同样一张纸的“辅币券”所代替，实质上是“用一张纸换另一张纸”，用毫无价值的纸强自人民手中夺取黄金、白银、银币及外币。（二）“人民存放国外资产登记管理办法”，规定人民于八月二十日前存放国外之一切资产在美金三千元以上者，均须于今年十二月底前申报登记。这表示四大家族之外的其他一切阶层人士的国外资产，均将为国民党反动集团所任意征发。（三）“整理财政及加强经济管制办法”，规定按战前标准调整各种税收；冻结薪资，取消生活费指数等等。这表示国民党区工人、职员及一切薪给工作者、将因而被打入更加痛苦不堪的饥饿深渊；工商业界将遭受更繁重的捐税勒索。这一办法的条款中，并规定在“财政经济紧急处分令”施行期间，“禁止封锁工厂、罢工及怠工”，企图以法西斯的暴力手段，压制工人对其饥饿政策与剥夺政策的反抗。
    可以明白看出，此次国民党反动政府实行所谓“改革币制”，以及所公布的与此相连的各种办法，都是蒋贼穷途末路的最后挣扎，除了只会引起更大规模的恶性通货膨胀，更高的物价上涨，更深巨的财政经济危机，和激起广大人民更广泛、更坚强的反抗，以加速结束其卖国反人民的统治之外，是不会有别的任何结果的。
