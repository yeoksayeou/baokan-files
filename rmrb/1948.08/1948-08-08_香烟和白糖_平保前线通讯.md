    Cigarettes and White Sugar
    Frontline Communication from Pingbao
    Before dawn on July 17th, the commanders and fighters of the 3rd Battalion of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, naked, crossed the Juma River and captured more than twenty warehouses around Dingxing Station, preparing to besiege the enemy entrenched in the station's pillboxes. When the soldiers of the 9th Company of the battalion entered the Tongxing Warehouse, they saw a dozen or so merchants dressed in silk trembling under the tables. The soldiers kindly called them out, briefly explained the People's Liberation Army's policy of protecting industry and commerce, and sent people to escort them away from the front lines.

    The soldiers had been fighting for a day and a night, and were exhausted and thirsty. They found all kinds of goods piled up in the warehouses, especially boxes of cigarettes and bags of white sugar, which were most striking. Everyone said in a low voice at the same time, "So many cigarettes!" "So much white sugar!" In fact, it was not surprising that the soldiers were so surprised, because they were tired and thirsty, and seeing so many cigarettes and white sugar at this time, they really wanted to smoke a cigarette to boost their spirits and drink a bowl of sugar water to quench their thirst. However, before the battle, they had all been educated on protecting industry and commerce and observing discipline. Everyone knew that the policy of protecting industry and commerce was more valuable than cigarettes and white sugar, so everyone consciously endured their fatigue and thirst, and no one took a cigarette or a bit of white sugar without permission.

    At dawn, the commanders and fighters of the battalion were ordered to transfer. Some merchants who remained in the warehouses warmly said goodbye to the soldiers. All kinds of goods, including the particularly eye-catching cigarettes and white sugar, were still placed untouched in the warehouses. The seals saying "Do not touch, do not push open" were still pasted high on the doors of the warehouses that were not guarded by their owners. A merchant living in the Gongshengshun transit warehouse said, "I have traveled all over China and have never seen such a good army!"

    香烟和白糖
    平保前线通讯
    七月十七日拂晓前，解放军某团三营的指战员们，赤身渡过了拒马河，攻占了定兴车站周围二十多家货栈，准备围攻困守车站碉堡中的敌人。当该营九连的战士们进入同兴货栈的时候，看见了十来个穿着绸子衣裳的商人，正爬在桌子底下打哆嗦，战士们很和气地把他们叫起来，简单的向他们解释了解放军保护工商业的政策，并派人护送他们离开了火线。
    战士们已打了一天一夜的仗，又累又渴。他们在各个货栈里发现堆满着各种各样的货物，特别是整箱的香烟和整包的白糖，最惹人注意。大家不约而同的低声说：“好多的香烟！”“好多的白糖！”实在，战士们这样惊奇并不奇怪，因为他们又累又渴，这时候看见了这样多的香烟和白糖，真想吸一支香烟提提精神，喝一碗白糖水解解渴；可是，他们在战斗之前，都受过保护工商业和遵守纪律的教育，谁也知道保护工商业的政策比香烟和白糖更宝贵，于是大家都自觉的忍住了疲劳和饥渴，谁也没有去乱拿一支香烟和一点白糖。
    天亮了，该营指战员们奉令转移，有些留在货栈里的商人，亲热地和战士们话别。各式各样的货物，包括特别引人注目的香烟和白糖，仍然原封不动的放在各个货栈里。“不要乱动，不准推开”的封条，还是高高的贴在那些没有主人看守的货栈门前。住在公盛顺转运栈的一位商人说：“我走遍全中国，没有见过这么好的队伍！”
