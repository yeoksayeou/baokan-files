Xinhua News Agency, North China, 7th: Tianjin's private industries such as weaving, dyeing, and match production are facing a severe crisis, with production sharply reduced and bankruptcies increasing daily. According to the Tianjin Industrial Monthly, Volume 5, Issue 7, published on July 1st, the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Industry Association's survey shows that the association currently has 1,107 member factories of various sizes, including cotton weaving, silk and hemp weaving, knitting, printing and dyeing, and thread twisting. The total number of looms (including electric and manual) is 14,403. Among them, 861 factories are operating, with only 7,079 looms in operation, and the number of looms that have stopped operating accounts for more than half of the total number of looms. One of the main reasons for the current crisis in the textile industry is the Kuomintang authorities' increasingly intensified monopoly and control. Taking raw materials as an example, the industry needs a total of 5,734 bales of cotton yarn per month, but in reality, the total amount of various cotton yarns that the factories can purchase each month is no more than 1,661 bales (less than 29% of the total demand). Regarding the match industry, according to the Tianjin Yishibao on June 21st and 22nd, there are 13 factories in the city, among which only the bureaucratic capital "Dahua" is still able to operate relying on its bureaucratic capital power, while the rest are in a state of semi-operation or shutdown. "Danhua" has only about 20 of its 60 machines in operation, while "Huabei" and "Zhaofeng" factories have already closed down. At present, the total output of matches in the city is only 300 cases per month (720 packs per case), which is less than one-twentieth of the pre-war peak output of 6,700 cases, while the current production equipment of each factory can produce more than 30,000 cases per month. The Kuomintang government's exorbitant taxes and levies are the main reason for forcing the industry into bankruptcy. The match tax is currently set at a high rate of 20% of the selling price, which makes it impossible for the factories in the industry to maintain operations. As for the city's cigarette industry, according to Yishibao on June 10th, there were 21 cigarette factories after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but now only 14 remain. Among them, only four are still operating, while the rest are operating intermittently or completely shut down. The current maximum output of factory equipment can reach 10,000 cases per month, but the actual output is only 3,000 cases.

    蒋匪垄断统制日益加厉
    天津民营工业垂危
    染织火柴等业倒闭日多
    【新华社华北七日电】天津织染、火柴等民营工业危机深巨，生产量激减，倒闭日多。据七月一日出版之天津工业月刊五卷七期载：津市织染工业同业公会调查，该会现有棉织、丝麻织、针织、印染、捻线等会员工厂大小共一千一百零七家。各种织机（包括电力、人力）台数共有一万四千四百零三台。其中开工的工厂八百六十一家，开工的织机仅七千零七十九台，停工的织机占织机总数半数以上。造成纺织业目前危机主要原因之一为国民党当局日益加厉的垄断统制，以原料为例，该业每月所需棉纱共五千七百三十四包，但实际上该业各厂每月可能购得的各种棉纱合计不过一千六百六十一包（不及总需要量的百分之二十九）。火柴业方面，据天津益世报六月二十一、二十二日载：该市共有十三家工厂，其中除官僚资本的“大华”，因凭借其官僚资本势力，尚能开工外，其余均陷于半开半停状态。“丹华”六十部机器仅有二十余部开工，而“华北”“兆丰”两厂则早已倒闭。目前该市火柴总生产量，每月仅有三百单箱（每箱七百二十包），较之战前最高产量六千七百单箱，还不到二十分之一，而目前各厂生产设备，则每月可产三万箱以上。国民党政府的苛捐勒索，是迫使该业于破产的主要原因，火柴税现被定为售价的百分之二十的高税率，致该业各厂均感无法维持。至于该市卷烟工业，据益世报六月十日讯，抗战胜利后，共有卷烟工厂二十一家，目前只剩十四家，其中除四家尚在开工外，其余均时开时停，或全部停顿，目前工厂设备最高产量可达每月一万箱，现实际产量及三千箱。
