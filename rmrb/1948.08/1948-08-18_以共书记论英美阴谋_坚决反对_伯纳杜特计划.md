　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS, Prague, 10th: Kozenko, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Israeli Communist Party, who recently visited Bucharest, stated: British and American figures insist on the international co-management of Haifa and Jerusalem, with their eyes only on the Haifa refinery and the potash of the Dead Sea. They are trying to allow American troops to enter Israeli territory and strengthen their position in the Suez area. Britain is waging war against Israel, while the United States is supporting it. The people of Palestine are very clear about this. Transjordan and the Arab armies under Abdullah are all supplied by Britain. Kozenko pointed out: "Bernadotte is serving the interests of Anglo-American imperialism," and declared: "The Israeli Communist Party supports any ceasefire leading to peace, but only by following the UN decision to establish independent Jewish and Arab states can peace be achieved." "We will never surrender to Bernadotte and the powers he represents."

　　以共书记论英美阴谋
  　坚决反对“伯纳杜特计划”
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社布拉格十日讯：新近访问布加勒斯特的以色列共产党中央委员会书记高桑斯基称：英美人士坚主国际共管海法与耶路撒冷，他们心目中看到的只是海法的炼油厂与死海的炭酸钾，他们正力图使美军得以进入以色列领土，并加强他们在苏彝士区的地位。英国正在对以色列进行战争而美国则在支持它。巴勒斯坦人民对这都极为明白，外约旦与阿布杜拉统辖的阿拉伯军队，都是英国给养的。高氏指出：“伯纳杜特正在为英美帝国主义利益服务，”并宣称：“以色列共产党拥护任何导向和平的停战，但只有遵照联合国决定，建立独立的犹太国与阿拉伯国才能护致和平。”“我们永远不向伯纳杜特及他所代表的列强投降。”
