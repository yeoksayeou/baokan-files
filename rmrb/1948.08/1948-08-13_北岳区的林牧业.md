　　Forestry and Animal Husbandry in the North Yue Region
    Zhang Wenzhao
    The areas around Mount Wutai in the North Yue Region, the Tuoliang Mountains at the intersection of Wutai, Fuping, and Lingshou, the Dianzi Mountains at the intersection of Laiyuan, Lingqiu, Wei County, and Guangling, and the Longshan Liang in Hunyuan, are densely forested and have abundant water and grass. They have always been excellent natural forest and pasture lands. The four districts of Fanshi Second, Fourth, and Sixth Districts, and Wutai Eighth District around Mount Wutai alone have 67,493 mu of forest land, producing pine, cypress, elm, birch, poplar, and other trees. Farmers in villages near the mountains have traditionally relied on forestry and animal husbandry as their main occupations. However, due to enemy destruction, coupled with the lack of serious organization, leadership, and management of forestry and animal husbandry by relevant agencies in the past, the forest rights of state-owned forests, village-owned forests, and private forests have not been defined. In many areas, forests are not protected, and indiscriminate felling and burning are common, leading to the gradual decline of forestry and animal husbandry. In order to increase forestry and animal husbandry production, the North Yue Administrative Office's Department of Agriculture and Forestry officially established a forestry and animal husbandry management organization in January of this year. Special forestry and animal husbandry cadres were also set up in six counties, including Wutai, Fanshi, Lingqiu, Guangling, Fuping, and Hunyuan. Forestry and animal husbandry assistants were set up in the Wutai Second, Fifth, and Eighth Districts, and Fanshi Second, Fourth, and Sixth Districts around Mount Wutai. Forestry and animal husbandry committees were established in villages with forests in this area to strengthen management and leadership. All forestry and animal husbandry cadres went deep into the forest areas under their respective management and maintained close contact with local village cadres. They educated the masses to implement the North Yue Region's "Reward Measures for Forest Protection and Tree Planting" and patiently cultivated grassroots organizations, helping the forestry and animal husbandry committees in each village. In areas where several villages need to jointly manage a forest area, a joint village forest protection committee is formed to be responsible for management. After half a year of efforts, initial results have been achieved. The forestry and animal husbandry management organization, located in Mount Wutai, not only mobilized the masses to plant trees on a large scale but also worked with local cadres to organize monks and lamas to plant 6,040 trees, of which 3,950 survived. Earning one jin of rice for each surviving tree solved a great difficulty for them. In the Daying area of Fanshi, forestry and animal husbandry cadres, in conjunction with the border region's forestry team and local cadres, led the masses to plant more than 35,000 trees and are preparing to focus on Fanshi and promote autumn afforestation, tree planting, cuttings, and layering. In order to improve and propagate livestock, the forestry and animal husbandry management organization also selected good breeding mares and breeding donkeys to mate with the masses' female livestock for breeding. Six breeding stations have been established in Shahe, Daying in Fanshi, Doucun in Wutai, Zihe in Lingqiu, Hunyuan City, and Xiliucun in Hunyuan, and more than 350 animals have been mated. More than 180 mares, more than 110 female donkeys, and some cattle and sheep have been lent or co-fed to the masses at low prices. The cattle in the mountainous counties of the North Yue Region are small and weak, mainly because the masses have long used one- or two-year-old calves for mating without keeping breeding bulls. It has now been decided to promote the selection of large bulls over three years old for breeding in the future. The forestry and animal husbandry farm operates a pasture in the Hongmenyan Lianhuapen area of Mount Wutai, welcoming people from all counties to graze their livestock. The farm has excellent stallions, providing free mating for mares on the farm. In addition, veterinary medicine is available, and the farm provides free treatment for cattle and horses on the farm. There are fifteen or sixteen pastures in Mount Wutai. According to statistics from eight farms, more than 2,300 animals have been brought to the pastures. In order to develop forestry and animal husbandry, the North Yue Administrative Office issued 600 shi of grain loans to the forestry and animal husbandry farms, one-third for forestry and two-thirds for livestock breeding.

　　北岳区的林牧业
    张文昭
    北岳区五台山周围，五台、阜平、灵寿交界的驼梁，涞源、灵邱、蔚县、广灵交界的殿子山，浑源的龙山梁等处，林木郁密，水草丰盛，向为天然的优美林牧场。只五台山周围的繁峙二、四、六区和五台八区等四个区森林地就有六万七千四百九十三亩；盛产松、柏、杆、桦、杨等树。靠山一带村庄的农民们，历来就以林牧为主业。但是，由于敌人摧残，加以过去有关机关对林牧事业没有认真的组织领导和管理，国有林、村有林、私有林的林权没有划定，不少地区对森林不加保护，滥伐滥烧，林牧业逐渐衰落。为增加林牧生产，北岳行署农林厅于今年一月正式成立了林牧管理机构，又在五台、繁峙、灵邱、广灵、阜平、浑源等六县专设了林牧干部，在五台山周围的五台二、五、八区，繁峙二、四、六区设了林牧助理员，在这一带有森林的村里，设立了林牧委员，加强管理和领导。林牧干部全部深入到各自负责管理的林区内，和当地区村干部密切联系，教育群众贯彻北岳区护林植树奖励办法，帮助各村的林牧委员，耐心的培养下层组织。在一个林区内需几个村联合管理者，组成联村护林委员会负责管理。经过半年来的努力，已取得初步成绩。林牧管理机构住在地五台山，除发动群众大量植树外，并和当地干部一起组织和尚喇嘛植树六○四○棵，成活三九五○棵，活一棵赚米一斤，给他们解决了很大困难。在繁峙大营一带，林牧干部结合边区林业组和当地干部领导群众栽树三万五千多株，并准备以繁峙为重点，提倡秋季造林植树插木压条。为了改良和繁植牲畜，林牧管理机构并选定好的种牝马、种牝驴，与群众的牝畜交配繁殖。并在繁峙砂河、大营、五台豆村、灵邱子河、浑源城及浑源西留村，设立六个种畜交配站，已交配三百五十余头。一百八十多匹牝马、一百一十多匹牝驴和一部牛羊，贱价贷给或伴喂给群众。北岳区山地各县耕牛体小力弱，主要原因是群众长期利用一二岁的牛犊交配，不留种牛。现已决定今后提倡选三岁以上大牛作种。林牧场在五台山鸿门岩莲花盆一带，经营牧场，欢迎各县群众前往放牧，场内设有优良种马，供上场母马免费交配。并且兽医药口，免费医治上场牛马。五台山共有十五、六个牧场，据八个场统计，已上场两千三百多头。为着发展林牧事业，北岳行署给林牧场发贷粮六百石，三分之一用于林业，三分之二用于牧畜繁殖。
