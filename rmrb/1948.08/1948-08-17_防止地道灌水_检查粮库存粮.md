　　Prevent Flooding of Tunnels, Inspect Grain Storage
    On July 22nd, while inspecting flood control on the south bank of the Sha River, I walked to the Shizi Street in ＠＠ Village, Xinqi District, Xinle, and saw that rainwater was pouring into the tunnels on both sides, collapsing three to four zhang, and some walls were also collapsing, and some houses were also cracking. I visited several people and asked why it had become like this, and they all said that the village was not united and no one was responsible. I think it's not just ＠＠ Village, I'm afraid it will happen elsewhere. I suggest that all villages, especially village cadres and militiamen, should pay attention immediately: (1) Inspect immediately, and repair any leaks immediately, and raise the earth well openings with soil to prevent rainwater from pouring in. (2) Pay special attention when it rains, and block any leaks immediately to prevent collapse. And should pay attention to factional struggles or sabotage by saboteurs. Border areas should pay even more attention. All grain depots also need to be inspected when it rains.

　　防止地道灌水　检查粮库存粮
    我七月二十二号在沙河南岸检查防汛，走到新乐新七区＠＠村十字街，见左右的地道灌进雨水，坍了三、四丈，也有墙灌坍的，有的房屋也裂了缝。我访问了好几个人，问为什么弄成这样，都是说村中不团结，没人负责任。我想不仅是＠＠一村，恐怕别处也会有。我建议各村，特别是村干民兵，应马上注意起来：（一）立即检查，有漏水的地方，马上修补，把土井口用土垫高些，以免雨水灌入。（二）下雨时应特别注意，发现漏水处马上堵塞，以免倒坍。并应注意派别斗争或破坏分子挖掘破坏。边沿区更应注意。各处粮库下雨时也需要检查。
