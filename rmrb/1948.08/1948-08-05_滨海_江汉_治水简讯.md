Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Briefs on river repairs and water management in liberated areas: (1) In Juxian County, Binhai District, Shandong Province, after the spring plowing and before the wheat harvest, the people across the country engaged in water conservancy projects. In the ten districts of Yanzhuang, Chengyang, and Zhaoxian, a total of seven rivers were dredged and ten dikes were built, protecting 100,000 mu of farmland from flooding. It is estimated that grain production will increase by 5 million jin this year. In Zhuting (formerly Ganyu County, located in the northeast corner of Jiangsu Province), eight dredging projects have been completed on the county's twenty-four rivers before the wheat harvest, benefiting 21,300 mu of land and potentially increasing grain production by more than 1.5 million jin. (2) In Jiangling, Qianjiang, and Jianli, some areas south of the Yangtze River in the Central Plains and near the Han River have recently experienced excessive rainfall, flooding over 10,000 mu of farmland. The Jianghan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Administrative Office have issued loans to organize the masses to repair dikes and rush to plant late-maturing crops.机关 personnel have also been mobilized to assist. Within ten days, dozens of large and small dike breaches have been repaired, saving more than 2,800 mu of farmland. Emergency repairs are still underway.

    【新华社陕北三十一日电】解放区各地修河治水简讯：（一）山东滨海区莒县春耕结束后，全国人民兴修水利，至麦收前，全县阎庄、城阳、招贤等十个区，共开河疏河七道，筑堤十道，使一百三十七个村十万亩良田免受水患，估计今年可增产粮食五百万斤。竹庭（原赣榆县，在江苏省东北角）全县二十四道河流，麦收前已成八道开疏工程，受益田地二万一千三百亩，可增产粮食一百五十余万斤。（二）中原汉水江南之江陵、潜江、监利部分地区近因雨水过多，田地被淹万余亩。中共江汉区党委及行署已发贷款一部，组织群众修堤开工赶种晚熟作物。机关人员亦出动帮助。十天中即修好大小堤口数十处，救出田地二千八百余亩，现仍继续抢修中。
