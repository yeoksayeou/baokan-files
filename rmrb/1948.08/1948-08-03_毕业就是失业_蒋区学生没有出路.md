Xinhua News Agency, North China, 28th: According to comprehensive reports from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, graduating university and middle school students in Peiping, Tianjin, and other places are facing the predicament of "graduation meaning unemployment." This year's graduating class at Peking University in Peiping has more than 700 students. School authorities sent out 200 job application letters for them in April and May, but the number of responses received so far is very few. Graduates from the university's medical, agricultural, and engineering colleges used to find jobs more easily in the past, but this year they are running into obstacles everywhere. Students graduating from Nankai University in Tianjin felt extremely uncomfortable about their future prospects in late June, before the end-of-term exams. The university's liberal arts and law schools wrote countless letters of introduction to various public and private institutions, but most of them did not receive a response, and some were simply rejected in the replies. More than 300 graduates from various departments of Peiping Normal College requested the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Education to provide appropriate internship opportunities, or else allow them to remain at the school and continue receiving public funding. Because this request was rejected by the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Education, they went on strike in mid-June to protest. The Tianjin branch of the "Chinese Institute of Engineers" telegraphed the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan in April, requesting that it "allocate special funds to arrange employment for this year's engineering graduates from various universities." Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan rejected this request. Faced with the oppression of unemployment and hunger, the entire graduating class of Northeastern University requested to stay in school and repeat their studies in order to rely on public funding for subsistence and avoid starvation. More than 250 graduates from Jinzhou High School and the male and female normal schools in Liaoning Province formed a joint petition delegation and went to Peiping in late June to petition for relief. At Northwest University in Xi'an, only ten out of nearly 300 graduates found jobs after the graduation exams in early June, forcing the university to allow graduates to stay in school and switch departments to continue their studies.

    毕业就是失业
    蒋区学生没有出路
    【新华社华北二十八日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：平津等地本年度毕业的大、中学生，正面临“毕业即失业”的窘境。北平北大本届毕业生达七百余人，学校当局四、五月间就为他们发出二百封求职信，但至今复函者仍寥寥可数。该校医、农、工三院毕业生，往年求职较易，但今年亦到处碰钉子。天津南开大学毕业生，在六月下旬学期考试前夕，为出路问题而感到无比的难受。该校文、法学院曾写了无数的介绍信到各公私机关等多半未得回信，有些则在回信中干脆拒绝。北平师院各科系毕业生三百余人，要求蒋记教育部介绍适当的实习机会，否则留校继续领取公费，因遭蒋记教育部拒绝，而于六月中旬罢考抗议。“中国工程师学会”天津分会，本年四月间曾电请蒋记行政院“另拨专款统筹安插本年度各大学工科毕业生”，最近蒋记行政院已加以拒绝，在面临失业与饥饿的压迫下，东北大学毕业生曾全班要求留校重读，俾得赖公费生活免于饥饿。辽宁省立锦州高中与男、女师范三校毕业生二百五十余人，组织联合请愿团于六月下旬赴北平请愿呼吁救济。西安西北大学近三百名的毕业生于六月初毕业考试后只有十人找到职业，使校方不得不允许毕业生留校转系继续攻读。
