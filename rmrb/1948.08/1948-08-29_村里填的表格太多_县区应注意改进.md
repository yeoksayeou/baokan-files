　　Too Many Forms to Fill in Villages
  　Counties and Districts Should Pay Attention to Improvement
    Throughout the year, we have many kinds of forms. This is done to grasp all kinds of figures, but some forms are filled out again and again. I suggest that all levels should pay attention to this, and the same form should not be filled out repeatedly. From January to July this year, I filled out the women's statistics form four times. There are also afforestation forms, water conservancy construction forms, and early-maturing crop forms that were sent out in April and have not yet been returned. This is partly due to the village not being responsible for filling them out, and partly due to the higher levels not urging them. Another type of form changes many times, requiring repeated filling out. I hope that in the future, when cadres at all levels are transferred, they must hand over all the old documents to avoid the new cadres having to re-collect the statistics. And once a form is sent out, it must be collected to avoid having to fill it out again.

　　村里填的表格太多
  　县区应注意改进
    一年之中，咱们的表格是有好多种，这是为了掌握各类数字而弄的，但有的表是填了一遍又一遍。我建议各级应加注意，同样的表不可三番五次的填。我今年一月份至七月份，填了光妇女数字表是四回了。还有发来的造林表、兴修水利表、早熟作物表，四月份发来，至今还未收回。这一方面是村中不负责填写，另一方面是上级不加催促而造成的。又一类的表要变好多样，几次的填写。我希望以后各级干部在调动时，一定要将旧的一切交代，免得新来干部再统计。并且一经发出去的表一定要收回，免得再填。
