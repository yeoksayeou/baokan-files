    Respecting Teachers and Loving Apprentices Improves Production
    A Certain Iron Factory in Taiyue Achieves Great Results
    [Taiyue Electric] After a certain iron manufacturing factory in Taiyue launched the "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" movement, production efficiency improved and apprentices' skills made rapid progress. Originally, among the ××× workers in the factory, there were only × skilled workers. In the sand molding department, there were ×× apprentices but only × skilled workers. Because the "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" movement was carried out, the apprentices respected their teachers and studied diligently, while the teachers enthusiastically taught the apprentices. Peng Jinlong, a master in the sand molding department, not only personally and patiently taught the apprentices skills, but also adopted the method of old apprentices teaching new apprentices, which was very effective. Apprentices could master the basic skills of sand molding in five months to half a year. After the ironworking department launched the "Respect and Love" movement, production efficiency improved significantly. In the past, one furnace could only forge three round iron bars in six hours. Now, with mutual assistance among the furnaces, it is not only convenient for the masters to guide, but also concentrates efforts to strike while the iron is hot, and production efficiency has almost doubled. According to June statistics, a total of 1,284 various machine parts were manufactured, 7 machines were manufactured and repaired, and in the first half of July, 100 scales and 3 coal-pulling machines were manufactured.

    尊师爱徒提高生产
    太岳某铁厂收效很大
    【太岳电】太岳某铁工制造厂开展尊师爱徒运动后，生产效率提高，学徒技术飞跃进步，该厂原×××个工人中，仅有×个技术工人。翻沙部有××个学徒，只×个技术工人。因为开展了尊师爱徒运动，学徒们尊敬师傅，苦心学习，师傅们则热心教授学徒。翻沙部彭金隆师傅除了亲自耐心教授学徒技术外，还采用老学徒教新学徒的办法，收效很大，学徒们有五个月到半年的时间，就可以掌握翻沙的基本技术。铁工部开展尊爱运动后，生产效率有显著提高，过去六个钟头一炉火，只能打三根圆铁，现在各炉互助起来，不但便利师傅指导，又能集中力量趁热打铁，生产效率差不多提高到一倍。据六月份统计，共制造各种机件一二八四件，制造修理机器七部，七月前半月制造磅秤百部，拖煤机三部。
