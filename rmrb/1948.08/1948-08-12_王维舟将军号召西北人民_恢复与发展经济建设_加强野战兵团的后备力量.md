On "August 1st" - the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army - the reporter visited General Wang Weizhou, the head of the comfort delegation. After praising the glorious achievements of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in the past year and a half, he called on the people of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui to support the front line with more active and enthusiastic practical actions to comfort the Northwest People's Liberation Army. He also asked all the people of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui to unite and cooperate with the front line to strive for greater victories in the third year of the Chinese People's Liberation War. He pointed out that in order to complete this task, the following work must be done wholeheartedly: 1. Strive for production, practice strict economy, restore and develop economic construction in the border area, and strengthen the material strength for supporting the front; 2. Strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents, help military dependents in production, practically solve the difficulties of military dependents, improve the soldiers' will to kill the enemy, and strengthen the soldiers' strength to kill the enemy; 3. Strengthen the work of returning to the team, enlighten the class consciousness of the soldiers returning to the team, solve the family difficulties of the soldiers returning to the team, warmly welcome the soldiers returning to the team to return to the front line, and consolidate and expand the strength of the troops; 4. Be responsible for resettling the honorably discharged soldiers, practically guaranteeing their lives, and practically facilitating their production; 5. Strengthen and expand the local armed forces, protect the safety of the revolutionary rear, maintain revolutionary order, establish a second-line corps, and strengthen the reserve forces of the field army. Finally, General Wang Weizhou emphatically pointed out that the revolutionary situation in the Northwest is developing victoriously, the fighting strength of the Northwest People's Liberation Army is constantly growing, and the fighting will is constantly rising, just like the rising sun in the east; the fighting strength of the Kuomintang army is shrinking day by day, and the fighting will is declining day by day, just like the sun setting over the river. At this time when the final victory is about to come, the front and the rear should cooperate more closely, wholeheartedly and heroically fight, attack Xi'an, capture Hu Zongnan alive, strive to liberate the Great Northwest as soon as possible, and cooperate with the great victory in the national scope.
