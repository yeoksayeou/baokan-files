Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch: Under the political offensive of the People's Liberation Army, soldiers of the Chiang army's New 7th Army, 60th Army, and other units trapped in Changchun, disregarding the bandits' brutal suppression, have been returning with their weapons one after another. According to statistics from the five reception centers on the periphery of Changchun over the past four months, a total of more than 3,000 Chiang army officers and soldiers have been received. Among them, one entire company, two entire platoons, and five entire squads returned collectively. They brought with them three 60mm mortars, twenty-five machine guns, two hundred and twenty-six rifles and carbines, one hundred and twenty-two hand grenades, more than twenty-three thousand rounds of ammunition, and six horses. According to soldiers from a certain company of the 21st Division of the Chiang army's 60th Army, within two or three days, the entire company dwindled from more than one hundred men to just over seventy. The Chiang soldiers who returned all recounted the hunger, abuse, low morale, panic, and wavering sentiment within the Chiang army. They said that in early May, soldiers could eat fifteen taels of grain, 70% being sorghum and 30% soybeans; by late May, the ratio became half and half. By early June, in addition to the 30/70 ratio, there were also layers of deductions, so soldiers could only eat a small amount of soybean porridge and wild vegetables every day. As a result, diarrhea, night sweats, dizziness, and other illnesses were widespread within the units. However, the bandit leaders still forced them to build fortifications and guard bunkers every day; those who were physically weak were brutally whipped. Therefore, war-weariness grew daily. They often discussed escape plans or practiced "guerrilla warfare" using both hands, rehearsing surrendering their weapons for food. In order to suppress the wavering sentiments of the people, the bandit leaders established many cruel and harsh laws. For example, soldiers were not allowed to approach the barbed wire, and those who violated this were beaten with military sticks; anyone who escaped would be buried alive if caught, and the fellow soldiers in the same squad would suffer under the system of collective punishment. However, under the increasingly tight siege of the People's Liberation Army, the bandit leaders were also constantly panicked, and the daily exercises for the troops were focused on how to retreat, digging the trenches step by step towards the city. Even in their speeches to the soldiers, they openly said that their only way out was "death." Some even said in despair, "Our future coffins will be the bellies of wild dogs."

But under the bandit leaders' despairing sentiments, the Chiang army officers and soldiers saw a bright path to survival, namely the People's Liberation Army's policy of leniency towards prisoners. The content of Commander Lin Biao's letter to the Chiang army officers and soldiers trapped in the cities of Northeast China has spread like wildfire within the Chiang army. Therefore, most of the Chiang army officers currently have their own plans. Some are preparing to go to Harbin; some are preparing to go home; and some are voluntarily taking down the burlap sacks from their homes and taking things to the small markets to sell, preparing early for the next step. Many soldiers are preparing to take more weapons and wait for an opportunity to join the People's Liberation Army, and are secretly actively helping the People's Liberation Army's political offensive. On June 19th, Pan Bolin, Zhou Chaolin, and Zhang Xuebin, soldiers of the Provisional 21st Division who escaped from the south of Changchun city, joined the frontline shouting on the third night after arriving at the People's Liberation Army, calling on their brothers in the Chiang army to quickly escape the sea of suffering and join the People's Liberation Army.

Furthermore, it is reported that the People's Liberation Army unit received a total of one hundred and twenty-seven Chiang army soldiers who had come from Shenyang and other places between July 1st and 9th. Among them were fourteen officers, including Wang Qingwan, the captain of the 3rd Brigade of the 207th Division, and Tan Yunsheng, the political instructor of the 261st Regiment of the 87th Division of the 71st Army.

    绝望中找到光明生路
    长春蒋军陆续来归
    【新华社东北电】被困长春的蒋军新七军、六十军等部士兵，在解放军政治攻势下，不顾匪首残酷镇压，陆续携械来归。据我军长春外围五个收容所最近四个月的统计：收容来归蒋军官兵共达三千余名。其中集体来归者有一个整连，两个整排，五个整班。其携来六零炮三门，机枪二十五挺，长短枪二百二十六支，手榴弹一百二十二个，子弹两万三千余发，马六匹。据蒋军六十军二十一师某连士兵谈称：该连两三天内，全连就从一百多人逃剩七十余人。来归的蒋军们都纷纷诉述蒋军中的饥饿、虐待及士气低落、恐慌动摇的情形。他们说：五月上旬士兵们都能吃到十五两粮食，七成高粮，三成黄豆；下旬就成了两样对半。六月上旬除了变成了三七外，还加层层的克扣，士兵每天只能吃到很少一点黄豆稀饭和野菜。因此部队内普遍流行泻肚、盗汗、晕眩等疾病。但匪首们每天还是逼迫他们去修工事，守地堡；体力不济的就痛得鞭打。因此，厌战的情绪日益发展。他们常常商量逃跑计划，或是使用两手，演习缴枪求食的“游击”。匪首们为了镇压人民动摇情绪，就订出许多毒刑苛法。如不许士兵靠近铁丝网，违者即以军棍乱打；凡是逃亡者抓住就活埋，同伍士兵并都要按连坐法受苦。但是在解放军日益困逼的情况下，匪首们也皇皇不可终日，整天要部队演习的课目就是怎样退却，并把交通壕一步步的向城内挖。连他们向士兵的讲话中也公开说他们的出路只有“死”。有的甚至绝望地说：“我们将来的棺材就是野狗的肚子。”
    可是在匪首们这种绝望的情绪下，蒋军官兵们却望着一条光亮的生路，即解放军的宽待俘虏政策。林彪司令员告困守东北各城市蒋军官兵书的内容，已在蒋军内一传十、十传百地传开了。因此，一般蒋军军官们目前差不多都有各自的打算。有的准备到哈尔滨；有的准备回家；有的则自动将家中的麻袋片撤下，把东西拿到小市上去变卖，早早准备好下一步的安排。许多士兵则准备拿更多的枪械待机投奔解放军，并暗地积极帮助解放军的政治攻势。六月十九日经长春城南逃出的暂二十一师士兵潘柏林、周朝林、张学斌，在来到解放军的第三天晚上，就参加了火线喊话，叫他们在蒋军里的弟兄们赶快脱离苦海，参加解放军。
    又讯：解放军某部在七月一日至九日内，共收容自沈阳等地来归的蒋军一百二十七人。其中有二○七师三旅上尉连长王庆惋，七十一军八十七师二六一团上尉指导员谭云生等官佐十四名。
