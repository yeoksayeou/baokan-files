　　Subsistence Rice Should Not Be Confiscated
    Comrade Editor:
    I have two matters for you to answer:
    1. In Damiyu Village, Jianping First District, one household was subjected to land reform last winter. Most of their house and belongings have been returned, but one east-facing room is still sealed with miscellaneous items. One member of this household was a cadre working elsewhere and was killed by the enemy last lunar August. The government issued 600 jin of subsistence rice to the family, but the village has confiscated it and refuses to return it. The household's class status has not even been discussed. Should the rice be returned to them? Please reply.
    2. In Nanguyue Village, Jianping First District, another household was also subjected to land reform last winter. A daughter of this household is married to a man from Beiguyue Village in the same district. Her husband joined the Eighth Route Army more than ten years ago and has not returned. The woman has no means of support and lives with her mother's family in Nanguyue. The preferential treatment grain issued by the government is also stored at her mother's house, totaling 1 shi and 8 dou and 5 sheng (large dou). The Nanguyue Village New Farmers Association has confiscated it and refuses to return it.
    I have raised these two matters with a comrade from the Jianping County Party Committee and a comrade from the First District Party Committee several times, but they have not been resolved. Should they be returned? Please reply.

    Answer: It is wrong for villages to arbitrarily confiscate subsistence rice issued by the government. Even if the household's class status is landlord or rich peasant, only their feudal property should be confiscated or requisitioned; their subsistence rice should not be confiscated. It is also wrong for the Nanguyue Village New Farmers Association to arbitrarily confiscate preferential treatment grain for military families; it should be returned immediately. We hope that leading comrades in these areas will pay attention to correcting these problems.

专栏：询问与答复

　　抚恤米不应扣封
    编辑同志：
    我有两件事请答复：
    一、建屏一区大米峪村，有一户在去冬被清算，房子、东西大部退了，只剩下一个东屋还封着一些乱七八糟的东西，该户有一人在外当干部，去年阴历八月间被敌人杀害，政府给人家家属发了抚恤米六百斤，被村中扣封到现在不退，这户的成份根本没讨论。是否应当退给人家呢？请答复。
    二、建屏一区南古月村有一户也是在去冬被清算，该户有一女儿在本区北古月村作媳妇，她丈夫参加八路军已有十年余未回，该女生活无办法，即在南古月她娘家住着，政府所发的优待粮也就放在她娘家，共计一石八斗五升（大斗）。被南古月村新农会扣封至今不退。
    以上这两件事我曾向建屏县委某同志及一区区委某同志提过几次，总是解决不了，到底是否应当退，请答复。

    答：政府所发抚恤米，村中随便扣封是不对的，即使那家成份是地主或富农，也只能没收或征收其封建部分的财产，不应扣封给他们的抚恤米。南古月村新农会，随便扣封军属优待粮也是错误的，应速退还。这些问题，希该地领导同志注意纠正。
