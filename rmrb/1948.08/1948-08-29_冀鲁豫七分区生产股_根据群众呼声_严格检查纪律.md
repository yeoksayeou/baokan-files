　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Seventh Sub-district Production Section
  　Strictly Inspects Discipline Based on Mass Demands
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric Dispatch] On the 14th of last month, the village cadre of Niu Wu Village, Sixth District of Shou Zhang, sent a letter to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, saying that the Production Section of the Seventh Sub-district borrowed items from the village and used delaying tactics and threats to avoid returning them. The newspaper published the letter. After seeing this article, the Production Section of the sub-district promptly conducted an investigation, compensated the masses for their losses, and apologized to the masses. After the compensation, they wrote to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, saying: "After seeing the mass demands published in the July 14th newspaper regarding the violation of discipline by the Production Section of the Seventh Sub-district in Niu Wu Village, we felt extremely ashamed and blamed ourselves internally. We immediately convened a Party meeting to inspect the discipline regarding the masses and decided to immediately compensate and apologize to the masses. I and Comrade Wang went to Niu Wu Village three times and admitted our mistakes at village cadre meetings and villagers' meetings, and compensated the masses for their losses, totaling 200,300 yuan in silver dollars. Including the 45,000 yuan previously compensated by Instructor Li, the total compensation amounted to 245,300 yuan. The serious violation of mass discipline in Niu Wu Village was due to our lack of strict inspection and timely correction in leadership. The opinions raised by the village cadres of Niu Wu Village are a great education for us, and we are very grateful. We hope that you will continue to give us your opinions in the future so that we can improve our work, improve ourselves, and further strengthen our ties with the masses."

　　冀鲁豫七分区生产股
  　根据群众呼声　严格检查纪律
    【冀鲁豫电】上月十四日，寿张六区牛吴村村干致函冀鲁豫日报，说七分区生产股借用该村物件，推拖威胁，硬不偿还，报纸当予发表。该分区生产股看到这篇文章以后，及时进行检查，赔偿群众损失，向群众道歉。并在赔偿后给冀鲁豫日报写信说：“看到七月十四日报上所登七分区生产股在牛吴村违犯纪律的群众呼声，我们感到非常惭愧，内心中在责备自己。我们当即召集党内会议进行群众纪律的检查，并决定立即赔偿，向群众道歉。我与王干事亲去牛吴村三次，在村干会、村民大会上都承认了错误，并赔偿了群众的损失，共折洋二十万零三百元。连以前李指导员在那里赔偿的四万五千元，共计二十四万五千三百元。在牛吴村违犯群众纪律这样严重，是我们领导上缺乏严格检查与及时纠正所致。牛吴村村干提出意见，这对我们是很大的教育，我们非常感激，还望今后常常给我们提意见，以便改进工作，改进自己，进一步密切与群众联系。”
