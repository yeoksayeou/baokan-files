　　Should the Government Vigorously Support Private Banks?
    Editor:
    We saw in the Beiyue Second District's Qianjin Bao, issue 20, page 2, an article stating, "When the private Yiwansheng Bank was established in Yangquan City and held its opening ceremony, responsible comrades from the city's Party and government, banks, shops, and railways all attended and spoke, explaining that the government and banks should vigorously support it." We believe that under the New Democratic economic system, private banks should be protected, but it is not a matter of "vigorously supporting" them. Please answer in the People's Report to clarify our understanding!
  　Readers Liu Liangjin, Yang Lai, and Li Tonggang, WuTai County Committee:
    Your opinion is correct. In the economy of a New Democratic state, private bank capital is allowed to exist for a certain period and under specific conditions. However, their business must be guided to benefit the national economy and play a positive role in the social production process. But private banks are different from factories. The latter directly engage in production activities, which have a progressive role in prospering the economy and developing production. Bank capital itself, however, cannot constitute any mode of production and only increases social idle capital, sometimes even disrupting finance. Therefore, the democratic government's main objects of support should only be agriculture, industry, and commerce, and should not include bank capital.

### 政府对私营银号应不应大力扶植？

专栏：询问与答复

　　政府对私营银号应不应大力扶植？
    编辑同志：
    我们看到北岳二分区前进报第二十期二版登有“阳泉市成立私营益万生银号举行开幕典礼时，市党政银行商店和铁路负责同志，都出席讲话，说明政府与银行要大力扶植”。我们认为新民主主义经济制度下，对私人银号应加以保护，但不是什么“大力扶植”的问题，对与不对，希人民举报答复，以明确我们的认识！
  　读者五台县委会刘良金、杨来、李同钢刘良金、杨来、李同钢同志：
    你们的意见是对的，在新民主主义国家经济中，私人银号资本在一定时期特定条件下，允许其存在，但必须指导其业务，使其有益于国民经济并对社会生产过程起积极作用。但私营银号和工厂不同，后者直接从事生产活动，对于繁荣经济发展生产有其进步的作用，而银号资本本身则不能构成任何生产方式，徒增加社会游资，有时甚至破坏金融。因之民主政府的主要扶植对象，只能是农工商业，而不应包括银号资本。
