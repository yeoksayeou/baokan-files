Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Reports from various sources: The ten-nation Danube Conference, convened according to the decision of the New York Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1946, officially opened in Belgrade on July 30th. Its purpose is to formulate a new Danube River Navigation Convention. The Soviet delegation is personally led by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky. The other participating countries are Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. In addition, Austria has also sent representatives to attend. The first day of the conference passed a resolution to use Russian, French, and English as the general languages of the conference, and Russian and French as the official languages of the conference. It also rejected the proposal by the US and British representatives to include English as an official language.

At the second meeting on the 31st, the French representative, with the support of the United States and Britain, openly made an arrogant statement with coercive means, stating: "The French government will spare no effort to maintain its 'vested rights.' Unless France agrees, it will not be bound by the new Danube River Navigation Convention, even if it is passed by an overwhelming majority." The Austrian representative even demanded the right to vote at the meeting. The statements of France and Austria and the speeches of the US and British representatives supporting them were condemned by the Danube countries. In his final speech, Soviet representative Vyshinsky first refuted the statement of the French representative, saying: "This is meaningless, and we will ignore it. We can say that the door of the conference is wide open to you; you can come in or go out as you please. We will never force anyone to participate. The conference is being held for cooperation and to discuss in harmony issues of concern to all participating countries. This is not like the Western European Union conference; words of command and ultimatum should be left outside the door." Vyshinsky then pointed out: "Austria's demands have no basis, because the Austrian peace treaty has not yet been signed, and it directly contradicts the past decisions of the Four Powers at the Foreign Ministers Conference, a decision that was unanimously agreed upon by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France." The results of the vote showed that the conference rejected the US proposal that Austria should have the right to vote by a vote of seven to two (the French representative abstained); and passed the Soviet proposal that "the conference should recognize the decision of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, and the Austrian representative can only participate in the meeting without the right to vote" by a vote of seven to zero. Because the latter proposal was righteous and stern, even the US and British representatives did not dare to vote against it and had to abstain.

Note: The Danube River Convention established in 1921 allowed the control of the Danube River's navigation management rights, which are directly related to the economic lifeline of the Danube River riparian states such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Austria, to be completely manipulated by the British and French imperialists, who were not Danube River states. During the discussions on the peace treaty after this war, the British and French, who had "vested rights" in the Danube River in the past, and the American imperialists, who were trying to gain a foothold in Eastern Europe after the war, unreasonably demanded that the peace treaties with Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria stipulate free navigation on the Danube River. This was firmly opposed by the Soviet Union, which strongly advocated that the Danube River navigation organization should be jointly decided by the riparian countries of the river itself, and that no other country should interfere. Finally, an agreement was reached between the two sides, deciding that the Danube countries (including the Soviet Union) and the member states of the Foreign Ministers Conference would meet together to discuss the matter ten months after the peace treaty came into effect. This conference was convened accordingly.

### 多瑙河会议开幕  维辛斯基驳斥法奥无理要求

    多瑙河会议开幕
    维辛斯基驳斥法奥无理要求
    【新华社陕北五日电】各方报导：根据一九四六年十二月纽约外长会议决定举行的十国多瑙河会议，已于七月卅日在贝尔格莱德正式揭幕，其目的在拟订新的多瑙河航运公约。苏联代表团由外交部副部长维辛斯基亲自率领，其他与会国为乌克兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、南斯拉夫、美国、英国及法国。此外，奥地利亦派有代表列席。第一日会议已通过以俄文、法文及英文为大会通用语言，俄文及法文为大会正式语言，并否决了美英代表要求把英文也列入正式语言的提案。
    在三十一日第二次会议上，法国代表在美英支持下公然以要挟手段提出狂妄声明称：“法政府将不惜以任何代价保持其‘既得权利’，除非得到法国同意，则将不受即使以压倒多数通过的多瑙河航运新公约之约束。”奥国代表则竟然要求在会上有表决权。法奥两国的声明与美英代表支持他们的发言，遭到各多瑙河国家的斥责。苏代表维辛斯基于最后发言中，首先驳斥法国代表的声明称：“这是毫无意义，我们将置之不理。我们可以说，会议的门是向你们洞开着的，进来也由你，出去也由你，我们决不强迫谁来参加。会议是为了合作，为了和协地讨论一切与会国所关心的问题而开的。这不比西欧联盟会议，命令与最后通牒式的字眼都该丢在门外。”维辛斯基继之指出：“奥国的要求没有任何根据，因为对奥和约尚未签订，并且与四强过去在外长会议上的决定直接抵触，而这一决定曾是美英法三国外长一致同意通过的。”大会举行表决结果以七票对二票（法代表弃权）否决了美国关于奥国应有表决权的提案；并以七票对零票通过了苏联所提“大会应承认四外长会议决定，奥国代表仅能参加会议而无表决权”的提案。由于后一提案义正词严，连美英代表也不敢投反对票而只好表示弃权。
    按：一九二一年订立的多瑙河公约曾使仅关系捷、南、罗、保、匈、奥等多瑙河沿岸国家的经济命脉的多瑙河航运管理权完全操纵在非多瑙河国家的英法帝国主义手中。此次大战后讨论和约时，过去在多瑙河握有“既得权利”的英法与战后力图插足东欧的美帝国主义竟又无理要求在对匈、罗、保和约中规定多瑙河自由通航，当遭苏联坚决反对，力主多瑙河航运机构应由该河沿岸各国自行共同决定，不容他国干涉。最后双方取得协议，决定在和约生效十个月后由多瑙河各国（包括苏联）与外长会议会员国共同集会讨论。此次会议即据此召开者。
