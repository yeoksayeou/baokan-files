Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 17th. Chen Xie's army has achieved great success in the military training movement due to the implementation of the principle of "consistency between learning and application and the mass line." In a certain battle, the unit repelled an enemy force fifteen times its size. The specific methods of military training in this unit can be divided into four points: 1. Combining practice with mass discussion. For example, when practicing capturing enemy fortifications, real fortifications are built. After everyone discusses the methods of capture, forces are organized to charge, and firepower is concentrated to carry out assaults. Then, people hiding inside the fortifications come out to report observations and feelings, and then continue to conduct research and practice. Other things, such as bridge construction and the use of firearms, are trained in the same way, so that the entire army can understand how to eliminate the enemy and protect themselves in practice, and technology has been greatly improved. 2. Train while fighting. For example, when the unit was defending a certain border area, it organized firepower and formulated counterattack plans based on the mission, terrain, enemy situation, possible enemy attack routes, and actions, and conducted multiple exercises and studies. After a certain company repelled an enemy attack, it immediately reorganized firepower and modified fortifications based on battlefield observations and understanding, and conducted exercises. 3. Implement three evaluations to summarize experience. After each battle or exercise, the unit held a squad meeting to evaluate technology, actions, and courage; everyone examined themselves, and everyone commented. After the evaluation, a squad was selected for a demonstration exercise. 4. Clear rewards and punishments. After the mass summary, the leadership organs at all levels immediately carried out commendations, rewards, and criticisms, and punishments.

　　陈谢某部练兵
  　贯彻学用一致与群众路线
    【新华社中原十七日电】我陈谢大军某部在练兵运动中，由于贯彻了“学用一致与群众路线”的方针，获得极大成绩。在某次作战中，该部即击退了十五倍于我的敌人的进犯。该部练兵的具体办法可分为四点：一、实习与群众讨论结合。如在练习夺取敌人工事时即筑好真正的工事，由大家讨论夺取办法后，组织力量进行冲锋、和集中火力实行突击。然后由隐蔽在工事内的人出来报告观察与感受到的情形，再继续作研究与实习。其他如架桥与火器使用等，都以同样方法训练，使全军在实习中都体会了如何消灭敌人保卫自己，技术均大大提高。二、边战边练。如该部坚守某边地时，即根据任务、地形、敌情、敌可能进攻路线及动作等，组织火力与拟定反击方案，并作多次演习与研究。某连击退敌进攻后，立即根据战场观察和了解重新组织火力修改工事，并进行演习。三、实行三评，总结经验。无论作战或演习后，该部均召开班务会评技术、评动作、评勇气；由各人检查自己，大家评议。评议后并选一班作示范演习。四、奖罚严明。经群众性总结后，各级领导机关立即进行表扬、奖励及批评、处罚。
