Xinhua News Agency, North China, 15th – The case of foreign missionaries from the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Church in Xian County, Hebei Province, including Shang Jianxun, endangering the liberated areas was sentenced on July 15th. The French Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Xi Juhe, in order to understand the situation of his country's citizens and the details of the case, arrived in Zhangjiazhuang, Xian County on July 24th after obtaining permission from the Hebei-Central Democratic Government. On the morning of the 26th, Director Luo of the Hebei-Central Administrative Office spoke with Mr. Xi for two hours. After detailing the policy of religious freedom in the liberated areas, Director Luo pointed out: "Foreigners are allowed to preach in China, but they must not interfere in China's internal affairs; especially during China's civil war, they should not participate in China's civil war and engage in espionage activities. However, French priests Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua, and Belgian priest Li Shitang illegally established radio stations in the liberated areas, collected information about our side, colluded with the Kuomintang army, and endangered our liberated areas. It is regrettable that such things happened among French priests. Therefore, it is necessary for the democratic government of the Chinese liberated areas to punish them with the appropriate crimes." After the conversation, Mr. Xi met with Wang Feiran, the President of the Hebei-Central Branch of the Higher People's Court. Mr. Xi expressed his full agreement with Director Luo's remarks and explained that "Shang Jianxun's criminal behavior has lost the neutral principle of French citizens in the Chinese civil war and constitutes the crime of participating in China's civil war. The government's handling of the case is very thorough, completely in accordance with legal procedures, the evidence is conclusive, and I fully agree with the government's verdict and am willing to assist in its execution. I request that the criminals be taken back to Tianjin and sent back to their country to serve as an example to French citizens and to prevent them from interfering in China's internal affairs and participating in China's civil war." Subsequently, Mr. Xi formally submitted the above request to President Wang in writing, and President Wang agreed. On the 29th, Mr. Xi took Shang Jianxun and the other three, as well as thirteen pieces of evidence such as their confessions, and fifteen photos back to Tianjin. In addition, a letter from the court to the Belgian Consulate in Tianjin, a copy of the judgment on Belgian priest Li Shitang, three copies of his confession, and three photos were also taken to Tianjin by Mr. Xi for delivery.

　　法驻津领事抵献县
    承认法传教士犯间谍罪
  　完全同意民主政府判决
    【新华社华北十五日电】冀中献县张家庄天主教堂外籍传教士尚建勋等危害解放区案，已于七月十五日宣判。法驻津领事奚居赫为了解该国侨民及该案详细情形，在得到冀中民主政府允许后，于七月二十四日到达献县张家庄。二十六日上午冀中行署罗主任约奚氏谈话达两小时。罗主任在详述解放区宗教信仰自由之政策后，指出：“外国人在中国传教是许可的，但决不能干涉中国的内政；特别是在中国内战时，更不应该参加中国的内战和从事间谍活动。而法籍侨民神甫尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华及比籍神甫李诗堂等，竟在解放区违法设立电台，搜集我方情报，勾结国民党军，危害我解放区，这样的事情竟发生在法国神甫之中，至为遗憾。故中国解放区民主政府判以应得之罪，实属必要。”谈话后，奚氏又与高等法院冀中分院王斐然院长会晤。奚氏当表示对罗主任的谈话完全同意，并说明“尚建勋等的犯罪行为，已失去法国侨民在中国内战中的中立原则，系犯参加中国内战之罪。政府处理案件很周密，完全按照法律程序，证据确凿无疑，对政府判决完全同意，并愿协助执行，请求将犯人带回天津遣送回国，以此给法国侨民作一榜样，以制止他们干涉中国内政、参加中国内战”。嗣奚氏又正式以书面向王院长提出上述请求，王院长当予允诺。二十九日奚氏乃携带尚建勋等四人及各供状等十三件、照片十五张返津。另有法院致比国驻津领事馆公函一件，对比籍神甫李诗堂判决书一份、口供三份、照片三张，亦一并由奚氏携津转达。
