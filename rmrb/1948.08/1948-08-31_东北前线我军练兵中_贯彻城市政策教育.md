Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th—The various units of the Northeast People's Liberation Army front have recently launched universal education on urban policies. In the last political consolidation of troops, due to the failure to implement urban policy education effectively, many cadres and soldiers did not recognize the importance of implementing urban policies from the perspective of the city's important significance to the revolution. They simply regarded it as an order and discipline issue from superiors. As a result, various remnants of erroneous thinking, such as the idea of taking the opportunity to make a fortune, the mentality of taking credit, the idea that victories can be won without relying on the city, and one-sided emphasis on military needs, have not been thoroughly resolved. Experience has proved that to completely overcome these ideological biases, it cannot be solved by one or two mobilizations and persuasions, but must be achieved through frequent and repeated education. For this reason, the focus of recent military training has been on ideological education to implement the discipline of entering the city, and strict criticism and self-criticism have been carried out in connection with past shortcomings. For example, a cook in the Sixth Company of a certain unit broke the stretcher rope while carrying the wounded during the battle to capture a certain city. He then took a rope from a store where no one was present. After the battle, the leadership not only praised him for actively rescuing the wounded but also criticized him for taking the rope inappropriately, but he refused to accept the criticism on the grounds of "military needs." During this study, the leadership raised this example for everyone to discuss. Some people thought that "taking the rope for the wounded is not a mistake," while others thought that "under the circumstances at the time, there were other ways to avoid taking the rope, so individual convenience cannot be considered a military need." Then the leadership enlightened everyone to discuss "What are the disadvantages of taking this rope?" Guiding everyone to the following conclusions: (1) It damaged the reputation of our army; (2) If everyone takes things randomly, it will definitely disrupt urban order and infringe on industry and commerce; (3) It violated the policy of protecting the city. Thus, it dispelled the idea of many people violating policies under the pretext of "military needs." A unit discussed whether the army should prevent the automatic distribution of warehouse materials to starving people after capturing the city. Everyone realized that if they were allowed to take things randomly, it would not only disrupt the order of the city but also add difficulties to the revolution and increase the burden on the majority of the masses, so it must be stopped. However, when discussing the methods of stopping it, some advocated using force to stop it, and opening fire when necessary, while others opposed this view. Finally, everyone unanimously believed that they should explain it carefully to the people. If individual bad guys deliberately cause trouble, they should be arrested and dealt with according to the law. Because everyone has a further understanding of implementing urban policies, some people have reviewed their "personal plans" to get something in the city. The leadership then carried out in-depth education in response to this situation. After education, the cadres of a certain company took the lead in registering personal belongings in order to supervise and inspect each other in the future to resolutely maintain the policy. After this study, the understanding of urban policies has been universally improved in all units. Everyone realizes that "destroying urban policies is like shooting oneself in the foot."

### 东北前线我军练兵中　贯彻城市政策教育

　　东北前线我军练兵中
  　贯彻城市政策教育
    【新华社东北二十八日电】东北解放军前线各部最近普遍展开城市政策教育。各部队在上次政治整军中，由于未能很好贯彻城市政策教育，致许多干部、战士对执行城市政策，没有从城市对革命的重要意义上去认识，只是简单的看成上级命令和纪律问题，因而各种错误思想残余，如乘机发洋财的观点，居功思想，不依靠城市也能打胜仗，片面强调军事需要等等问题，都未得到彻底解决。经验证明要完全克服这些思想偏向，不是一次两次动员说服就能解决，而必须经常反复的进行教育始能达成。为此，各部在最近练兵中，即以贯彻入城纪律的思想教育为重点，并联系过去缺点，开展严格的批评与自我批评。如某部六连某炊事员在攻克某城的战斗中，因抬伤员时担架绳子断了，他便到一家没有人的商店里拿了一条绳子。战斗结束后，领导上除表扬了他积极救护伤员外，又批评了他拿绳子不对，但他却以“军事需要”的理由不接受批评。该连在这次学习中，领导上即提出这一实例交大家讨论。有的认为“为了伤员拿绳子不算错误”，有的认为“在当时情况下，不拿这绳子也有办法，那么个人方便不能算做军事需要”。于是领导上又启发大家讨论“拿了这根绳子有什么坏处？”引导大家得出如下结论：（一）破坏了我军名誉；（二）大家乱拿就一定破坏城市秩序，侵犯工商业；（三）违反了保护城市的政策。从而打消了许多人借口“军事需要”而违反政策的思想。某部讨论我军攻克城市后，对饥民自动分仓库物资是否应予制止，大家认识到如果让他们乱拿，不仅破坏了城市的秩序，更给革命增加了困难，反给大多数群众增加了负担，因此必须制止。但在讨论制止办法时，有的主张用武力制止，必要时就开枪，有的反对这种意见，最后一致认为应该好好向老百姓解释，如果有个别的坏蛋故意捣乱，应该依法逮捕办理。由于大家对执行城市政策有了进一步的认识，故有些人都检讨了想到城市里弄点东西的“个人计划”。领导上针对这种情况又进行了深入教育。某连经过教育后，干部即带头进行个人财物登记，以便将来相互督促和检查，以坚决维护政策。各部经此学习，对城市政策的认识均普遍提高，大家都认识到：“破坏城市政策就是搬起石头打自己的脚。”
