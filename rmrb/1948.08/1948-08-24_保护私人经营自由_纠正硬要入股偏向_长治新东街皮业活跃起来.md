　　Protecting Private Business Freedom
  　Correcting the Tendency to Force Shareholding
  　The Leather Industry in Xindong Street, Changzhi, Becomes Active
    [Taihang News] Xindong Street in the Third District of Changzhi City resolutely implemented the policy on industry and commerce, withdrew the mass share capital that had infringed on private business freedom and been forcibly invested in private leather workshops, allowing the original owners to produce independently and freely, and the leather workshop industry gradually became active. Xindong Street originally had five small leather workshops owned by independent laborers such as Ma Tongxin, which made good profits from making and selling their own products. In April 1946, after the citizens' struggle, the fruit money was distributed, but they could not find a way to produce, so the cadres forcibly mobilized Ma Tongxin and other leather workshops to "serve the masses." First, Ma Tongxin and Liu Jide were allowed to partner, and then the masses were allowed to buy shares, expanding the shareholders to 41 households with a capital of 275,500 yuan, becoming a "joint venture" leather workshop. However, Ma Tongxin only invested 50,000 yuan, and the furniture was provided for the masses to use, and the leather goods were put aside. Then, the leather workshops of Zuo Shuntong and Zuo Shunchang, two brothers in the street, were forcibly merged into one, and the shareholders were expanded to 30 households with a total capital of 200,000 yuan. Because of the small amount of capital, production could not be started, so the two brothers put half of the original capital back in. Liu Yusheng, fearing struggle, asked the masses to invest in his leather workshop. 57 households invested, with a capital of 370,000 yuan, but he only put in half of the goods, worth 150,000 yuan, and also became a "joint venture" leather workshop. In the past two years, the mass share capital has gradually increased, and the original owner's share capital has gradually decreased. In Zuo Shunchang's brothers' leather workshop, the funds forcibly invested by the masses increased to 653,000 yuan, while the two brothers withdrew 200,000 yuan, and in the remaining 200,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan was registered under the name of his son-in-law. In Ma Tongxin's leather workshop, the share capital forcibly invested by the masses increased to 610,000 yuan, while the capital of Ma and Liu was only 150,000 yuan. In Liu Yusheng's leather workshop, the share capital forcibly invested by the masses increased to 782,000 yuan, and Liu Yusheng's 150,000 yuan share capital not only did not develop, but was also frozen last year when he managed the landlord. Each leather workshop had cadres and activists who went in to serve as managers and accountants, who neither understood the technology nor knew how to manage, which hindered the development of production. In March of this year, the cadres of the district studied the section on protecting industry and commerce in Chairman Mao's report, and reviewed that it was wrong to freeze Liu Yusheng's funds, so they held a street cadre meeting to repeatedly study and clarify their thinking, and unfroze Liu Yusheng's share capital. They reviewed that it was wrong to forcibly invest mass share capital in private leather workshops, and everyone also agreed that it was wrong, but they were not determined to correct it. After further study of the policy on industry and commerce, their thinking became clear, and under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, they formally started to correct the deviation in July. (It is very right to correct the deviation, but it should not have been delayed until July to formally start. This is a manifestation of not being resolute enough in correcting the deviation, and it should be examined and overcome - Editor) First, they convened a forum with Ma Tongxin and others to explain the policy of protecting industry and commerce. After Ma and others understood the policy on industry and commerce, they expressed their willingness to produce on their own, and the leaders mobilized the masses to withdraw their shares. At first, the masses did not understand, and some said: "People have wings and can fly, what can we do without wings?" Tian Fuyuan said: "Let's just let them withdraw, what can we do?" The leaders understood that these masses did not have the ability to produce, and asked the leaders to help them find ways to produce. Therefore, while explaining to the masses the importance of protecting private capital management, they also worked with street cadres to help the masses find a way out for their capital. At this time, the District Credit Cooperative and the Xindong Store recruited share capital. Except for a few shareholders who were willing to produce on their own, most of the withdrawn funds were organized to be invested in the Xindong Store and the Credit Cooperative. In this way, the three leather workshops became five again, the number of workers gradually increased, and the old goods preserved by Ma Tongxin and others in the past were also taken out, and the capital was expanded five or six times compared to before. The capital of Zuo Shunchang's leather workshop with two workers has been increased to 500,000 yuan, and they have also agreed with three workers to bring some capital to cooperate in production. The capital of Liu Yusheng's leather workshop has increased to 1.1 million yuan. Liu Jide and his four sons are also engaged in a business with a capital of one million yuan. Zuo Shuntong concentrated 450,000 yuan of capital and hired a worker. (Guo Jinxian, Hu Shuiwang, Xie Mazhi)

　　保护私人经营自由
  　纠正硬要入股偏向
  　长治新东街皮业活跃起来
    【太行讯】长治市三区新东街坚决执行工商业政策，把侵犯了私人经营自由，硬入到私人皮坊里的群众股金抽出，让原主独立自由的生产，皮坊业逐渐活跃起来。新东街原有马同心等独立劳动者的小型皮坊五座，自做自卖很赚钱。一九四六年四月，市民斗争分到果实款，找不着生产门路，干部就硬动员马同心等皮坊“为群众服务”。先让马同心、刘积德两人合伙，后让群众入股，扩展股东四十一户，资本二十七万五千五百元，成了“合营”的皮坊。但马同心仅入股五万元，家具供给群众使用，皮货搁起来了。接着又硬把该街左舜通、左舜昌弟兄俩的皮坊合成一个，股东扩至三十家，共二十万元资本，由于资本少，生产不开，弟兄俩又把原来资本放进去一半。刘玉生因怕斗争，而要求群众往他皮坊入股，群众入股的有五十七户，资本三十七万元，自己仅放进一半货，值十五万元，也变成了“合营”的皮坊。两年来群众股本逐渐增加，原主股本逐渐减少。左舜昌弟兄的皮坊，群众硬入进去的资金增至六十五万三千元，他弟兄俩却抽去资金二十万元，留下的二十万元中，还给他女婿名下记了五万元。马同心的皮坊、群众硬入进去的股金增至六十一万元，马刘二人资金仅十五万元。刘玉生的皮坊，群众硬入进去的股金增至七十八万二千元，刘玉生的十五万元股金不但没发展，去年管理地主时更给冻结了。各皮坊都有干部积极分子进去当经理、当会计，既不懂技术，又不会经营，阻碍了生产的发展。今年三月，该区干部学习了毛主席报告中保护工商业的一节，检讨到冻结刘玉生的资金是不对的，就召开街干部会反复研究，打通思想，解冻了刘玉生的股金。检讨到把群众股金硬入到私人皮坊，大家也认为不对，但还没有决心纠正。后经进一步学习工商业政策，思想上明确了，在市委直接领导下，七月间正式着手纠偏。（纠偏很对，但拖延至七月才正式着手是不应该的，这是对纠偏还不够坚决的表现，应检查克服——编者）首先召集马同心等座谈，讲解保护工商业政策。马等了解了工商业政策后，表示愿意自己生产，领导上就动员群众退股。起初群众闹不通，有的说：“人家有翅膀能飞，咱没翅膀的人怎么办？”田福元说：“叫抽抽吧，那有啥办法哩？”领导上了解这些群众没有生产能力，要求领导上帮助找生产门路，因此一面向群众解释保护私人资本经营的重要，一面和街干部共同帮助群众找寻资本出路。此时区信用社与新东商店招收股金，除个别退股的群众愿自己生产外，大部退出的资金都组织投入新东商店和信用社。这么一来，三个皮坊又变成了五个，工人陆续增加，过去马同心等保存的旧货又拿出来了，资本比前扩大五六倍。左舜昌皮坊两个工人的资本添成了五十万元，又自行约定三个工人，也准备带部分资金来合伙生产。刘玉生皮坊资本增至一百一十万元。刘积德父子四个生产，也成了百万资本的生意。左舜同集中四十五万元资金，雇了一个工人。（郭进贤、胡水旺、谢马只）
