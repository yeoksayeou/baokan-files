    Piece-Rate Progressive Wage System Implemented
    Xin Sheng Weaving Factory Increases Towel Production by Seven Hundred Dozen in One Month
    [Our Dispatch] The Xinji Workers' Cooperative – Xin Sheng Weaving Factory, implemented a piece-rate progressive wage system, worker morale is high, and production has increased unprecedentedly. In the past, the factory's workers' wages were based on a graded subsidy system (monthly finished products were rated into four grades, with subsidies of 50, 40, 30, and 20 jin of millet), which improved product quality to some extent, but workers' production was still not energetic. Worker Liu Wanliang said: "Grading is just a rough estimate. Wages are calculated monthly, and whether you weave three or two dozen more a month doesn't show, and whether you weave three or two dozen less doesn't mean you earn less; like Cui Dazhi, who wove thirty-eight dozen and five towels in April, which was rated as Grade A in terms of quality, but the quantity was too small. He himself suggested that he should earn less wages, but no one spoke up at the meeting, and as a result, he earned the same as someone who wove eighty dozen and two." The factory found out about this situation and immediately discussed improvement methods with the workers, based on the spirit of mutual benefit for labor and capital, increasing quantity, improving quality, and reducing costs, and decided to implement a piece-rate progressive wage system within the original scope of 40% profit sharing for the labor side; and specifically stipulated production standards and wage amounts: fine thread single-yarn and fine thread double-yarn towels, one jin of millet per dozen, twelve liang for trainees. Coarse thread single-yarn fourteen liang per dozen, general ordinary goods twelve liang per dozen, half a jin for trainees. The maximum monthly output is ninety dozen, the general output is eighty dozen, and the trainee output is sixty dozen. All parts exceeding the production standard will be paid double the original wage. In addition, the quality of the goods is rigorously inspected, and those whose quality has been significantly improved will have their quantity increased appropriately through public discussion to show encouragement.
    Since the implementation of the new standards in May, the workers have all said: "The diligent ones can earn more, the lazy ones earn less, and no one will carry the burden for anyone!" Morale has increased, and production has also increased. In April, when the subsidy system was implemented, the factory's total output was 935 dozen, and in May it reached 1,300 dozen; in June, it increased by another 333 dozen compared to May. Worker Yang Qingze was rated as Grade B in April and earned a subsidy of 40 jin of millet. In May, he wove 95 dozen and eight pieces on a piece-rate basis and earned 75 jin of millet. Trainee Yang Zhihua earned a subsidy of 20 jin of millet in April, and in May, he wove 63 dozen, earning 13 jin of millet more. In June, he exceeded the output of Wang Shuangzeng, an older worker with poorer skills, by 20 dozen. The phenomenon of workers starting machines early and leaving late, not resting, and not going home has also become more common. (Xing Jun)

    改行按件累进工资制
    新生织工厂一月
    增产毛巾七百打
    【本报讯】辛集职工合作社——新生织工厂，实行计件累进工资制，工人情绪高涨，产量空前提高。该厂工人工资，过去实行按级津贴制（每月成品评为四等，津贴五十、四十、三十、二十斤小米），虽在产品质量上有些提高，但工人生产仍不起劲。工人刘万良说：“分等级，不过是大体上捏捏节，工资按月算，每月多织三打两打的也不显，少织三打两打的也不少挣钱；象崔大志，四月份织毛巾三十八打零五条，按质量说是甲等，就是数量太少，人家自己提出应少挣工资，会上没人发言，结果和织八十打零两条的挣钱一般多。”厂方发觉这个情况，即和工人商讨改进的办法，本着劳资两利，增加数量，提高质量，减低成本的精神，决定在原定劳方分红百分之四十的范围内，按照技术的高低，实行计件累进工资制；并具体规定了生产标准和工资数目：细线单毛和细线双毛手巾，每打小米一斤，学员十二两。粗线单毛的每打十四两，一般大路货每打十二两，学员半斤。最多每月出品九十打，一般的八十打，学员六十打。凡超过生产标准部分，按原定工资加一倍。并认真实行验货，对质量有显著提高者，通过公议，酌情提升数量，以示奖励。
    从五月份实行了新的标准，工人们都说：“勤劳的能多挣，懒散的少挣，谁也不给谁背坯！”情绪高了，生产量也多了。四月份实行津贴制，全厂出品九百三十五打，五月份即出到一千三百打；六月份较五月份又增多三百三十三打。工人杨庆择四月份评议为乙等，挣津贴米四十斤，五月份计件织了九十五打零八条，挣米七十五斤。学员杨志华四月份挣津贴米二十斤，五月份织了六十三打，多挣米十三斤，六月份即超过技术较差的老工人王双增二十打。工人们早上机子晚下班，不歇着，不回家的现象也较为普遍了。（行军）
