Why is the Land Barren?
  Quyang County Government's Insufficient Inspection, Reader's Letter Raises Opinions
    Comrade Editor:
    After reading the Quyang County Government's explanation of the reasons for barren land published on page two of the July 31st newspaper, I have some different opinions. There may be several "reasons" for barren land, but I believe that today, when the Central Committee requires us to "spend at least more than half of our time" leading production, simply explaining the reasons for barren land in this way is insufficient (because it does not explain who should be held responsible for this failure of leadership). Reading this letter makes me feel that the cadres in Quyang have not been leading production, because many problems that could be solved have not been solved for the masses. Even these few reasons for barren land were only "investigated, researched, and analyzed" after receiving the newspaper's letter, and only after listening to "the masses' reflections." This shows that the Quyang County Government did not pay attention to these matters beforehand. Since the reasons for the barren land have been found, the letter does not say how to remedy the situation or whether there are any ways to solve it. "The rain came too late, and the masses saw that planting would not yield much, so they were lazy to plant." The most recent heavy rain was around July 20th, which is not yet the hottest period, and it is not too late to plant buckwheat, or at least vegetables; but the masses were "lazy to plant," so the land is still barren. For example, the abandoned land of Yang Shahou "is not managed by the head of the household, nor by the cadres, and all seven mu of land are barren." Why do the cadres "not manage" it? This probably refers to the village cadres, but have our cadres who are detached from production managed it? I don't think it is appropriate to push all the responsibility onto the village cadres. Furthermore, the fourth reason states that last year "there was no grain harvest, plus there was a lack of labor (manpower and animal power) to plant." To allow the land to be barren means that there will definitely be nothing to eat next year; either people will flee the famine, or they will have to rely on government relief. Also, "the four mu of gardens in Tianjiakan, etc., are all land that was re-checked and found to be left over without being distributed." This shows that it is not "inferior" land that no one wants to plant. If we are to find the reasons for this land being barren, we should look for them in the extent to which we serve the masses. "In the past, some villages set the unified progressive tax and output quotas too high... the masses felt that after planting, the grain they obtained would not be enough after paying taxes" (it is difficult for this to be the case). Such feedback may be understandable during land distribution, but after the side government's abolition of the unified progressive tax and implementation of the proportional tax system had already been published in the newspaper, it is strange that this feedback still exists, and this relates to whether we have explained this issue to the masses. I hope that the Quyang County Government will meticulously count all the barren land in the county this year and make an accurate estimate of its yield. Then, based on the figures, specifically examine our mass viewpoint and our production leadership. I wonder if this is correct?

### 地到底为啥荒了？　曲阳县府检查不够读者来函提出意见

　　地到底为啥荒了？
  　曲阳县府检查不够读者来函提出意见
    编辑同志：
    看到七月三十一日报纸二版登载的曲阳县政府对荒地原因的说明，我有些不同的意见。荒地的“原因”，也许有那么几条，但我认为在今天中央要求我们“至少拿一半以上的时间”来领导生产的时候，只这样的说明荒地原因是不够的（因为它并没有说明那些该我们领导上来负责）。看了这封信，使我觉得曲阳的干部并没有领导生产，因为许多能够解决的问题并没有给群众解决。就是这几种荒地的原因，也是在接到报社的信后才去“调查研究分析”，才去听“群众反映”。可见曲阳县政府事前并没有注意这些事情的。既然找出了荒地的原因，如何设法补救，是否还有办法解决，信里边也没有说。“雨下的太晚了，群众看到种上也打不了什么东西，故懒种了”。最近的透雨是在七月二十日左右，还不到大暑，种荞麦还不晚，至少可以种菜；但群众“懒种”，所以地也还是荒了。又如杨砂候的绝户地“当家子不管，干部不管，将七亩地全荒了”。干部为什么“不管”？这里大概是指的村干部，但我们脱离生产的干部管来没有？把责任全推给村干部，我认为不妥。再如第四条里说去年“没打粮食，再加上劳力缺乏（人力畜力）种不及”，听其地荒，明年定然没有了吃的；不是逃荒，就只有靠政府去救济了。再如“田家坎园子四亩等，都是复查出的土地没有分配完余下的。”这可见并不是“较坏”没人种的地。假如找这种地荒的原因，应该从我们为群众办事的程度上去找。“过去有些村地里统累税产量订的高………群众感到种上所得之粮食纳了税不剩东西”（很难有这种情况）。在分地时有这种反映可以，而在雨后种地时，边府的废除统累税实行比例税制早已在报上发表过之后，仍然有这反映，便很奇怪，这里关涉到我们是否向群众讲过这问题。我希望曲阳县政府把全县今年的荒地精细统计一下，其产量亦作正确的估计。从而根据数字具体的检查我们的群众观点，检查我们的生产领导。不知以为然否？
