The People Bravely Rescue,
Turning Danger into Safety at the Perilous Works Along the Pingxiang River

[Jinan Electric] On July 20th, the Fuyang River and Xiaozhang River within Pingxiang County experienced a sudden surge in water levels. The county party committee immediately mobilized county and district cadres to inspect river embankments, perilous works, waterways, and sluice gates. On the 23rd, they convened a meeting of village cadres from 142 villages along the river in the first, second, and fifth districts to discuss flood prevention work. At the meeting, through education and mobilization, the narrow-minded experience of village cadres who believed "the river water is muddy, it rises fast and falls quickly," and the village-centric thinking of each looking after their own, were broken down. A unified leadership was agreed upon, and concrete methods for organizing manpower and materials for flood prevention were decided. After the meeting, more than 25,000 people were mobilized, and in a three-day blitz, they completed the construction of more than 2,000 zhang of perilous works on the 30,000 zhang long river embankment, as well as dredging river channels, repairing embankments, and building earth levees. More than ten li of newly built embankments on the Xiaozhang River were washed away, and breaches occurred successively in Ge Village in the fifth district, Fuxiazhuang in the second district, and other places. Through the selfless and courageous efforts of the villagers, the breaches were quickly plugged. The breach in Ge Village was about three or four zhang wide. During the plugging process, one farmer bravely entered the water and used his body as a stake, blocking the water with mats, filling the gate with earth, and completing the plugging in just thirty minutes. The Yangzhuang River embankment was low, and water overflowed the embankment. When the masses discovered this, they immediately and spontaneously lay down several people to block it with their bodies. (Such a heroic spirit of selflessness should be praised and learned from – Editor). The newly built embankment on the Xiaozhang River near Songxiazhuang was the largest perilous work in the county. The new embankment was about fourteen or fifteen li long, with more than seven hundred zhang of perilous works. The water outside the embankment was four chi deep, and most of the inner and outer golden embankments were destroyed. The masses had previously driven piles and built more than three hundred zhang in the water. Thanks to the active leadership of county, district, and village cadres and the courageous efforts of the masses in rescue and plugging, all the perilous works were able to turn danger into safety, and the breaches were quickly plugged. The Pingxiang flood prevention work achieved these results due to the following reasons:

(1) The thinking of cadres and the masses was straightened out, enabling everyone to fully value flood prevention work. At the village cadre meeting, the specific facts of upstream river flooding and the previous situations of river flooding were used to enlighten and educate, emphasizing mutual rescue and disaster prevention, and resolving the parochial thinking of the masses in villages close to the river who feared that one village could not stop the breach, and the villages far from the river felt that the risks of flood prevention and rescue were not great, and therefore were indifferent. (2) The leadership attached importance to it and grasped it tightly. When the river water began to surge, the county-level leading organs used telephones to understand the situation and personally went down to inspect. After discovering the danger, they immediately made a plan (how much manpower and materials, sorghum stalks, wooden piles, equipment, etc. were needed), mobilized and deployed to carry out repairs. When the breach or perilous work was urgent, the masses often lost confidence. At this time, the leadership provided good encouragement, improving the masses' confidence in flood prevention and risk blocking. During flood prevention and rescue, some villages had disagreements due to inconsistent interests, which affected the rescue work. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately conducted education, resolved the disputes, and made the rescue work proceed smoothly. (3) The leadership grasped the principle of not losing the big picture because of the small. When Songxiazhuang was repairing the seven hundred zhang of dangerous work (three hundred zhang had already been repaired), they used six or seven hundred wooden piles as thick as two hands and eight chi long, and ten thousand jin of sorghum stalks. In terms of materials, the amount was not small, but it was much more cost-effective than the breach of the West Dike of the Xiaozhang River, which flooded seven qing of vegetable gardens and reduced the harvest by 70,000 jin of grain. In the work of building earth mounds, instructions were given in advance to arrange long ditches or square pits in open spaces to prevent damage to seedlings. This overcame the previous phenomenon of the masses wasting materials and trampling on seedlings at any time in order to repair river embankments, and at the same time avoided water disasters.

### 干群奋勇抢救　平乡沿河险工转危为安

　　干群奋勇抢救
  　平乡沿河险工转危为安
    【冀南电】平乡县境滏阳河、小漳河等河水，于七月二十日暴涨。该县县委立即动员县区干部，分头检查河堤、险工、水道、闸口。二十三日，又召开一、二、五区沿河一百四十二村村干大会，讨论防汛工作。在会上经过教育动员，打破了村干部“河水是混的，涨的猛落的快”的狭隘经验，及各顾个的村本位思想，议定了统一领导，组织人力物力具体防汛的办法。会后便动员了两万五千多群众，经三天突击，在三万丈长的河堤上，完成了两千多丈险工的修筑，及疏浚河道，修补堤岸，建筑土牛等工程。小漳河有十多里新修的堤岸被冲毁，先后在五区葛村，二区孵下庄等处决口，经各村群众奋不顾身的突击抢堵，各决口很快堵住。葛村决口宽约三四丈，塞堵时有一农民奋勇入水，以肉体做桩，用席挡住水口，塞门填土，仅三十分钟即塞堵完成。杨庄河埝低，水从埝上漫过，群众发觉，马上自动躺倒数人，以肉体堵挡。（似此为公忘私的英勇精神，值得表扬与学习——编者）宋下庄附近小漳河新修河堤，为全县最大险工，新堤长约十四五里路，险工七百余丈，堤外浸水达四尺深，内外金堤大部冲毁，群众曾在水里打桩修筑三百多丈。由于该县县区村干部，积极领导和群众奋勇抢堵，各险工都能转危为安，决口迅速堵住。平乡防汛工作获得这些成绩，有以下几点原因：
    （一）搞通了干部和群众的思想，使大家对防汛工作有了充分重视。在村干会上，用上游河泛成灾的具体事实和以往河泛成灾的情形，进行启发教育，强调互救防灾，解决了离河近村群众怕决了口一个村堵挡不住，和距河较远的村庄对抢险防汛感觉利害不大，因而漠不关心的本位思想。（二）领导上重视，抓的紧。当河水开始暴涨时，县级领导机关便利用电话了解情况，并亲自下去检查，发现险以后，马上做出计划（需要多少人力物力，秫秸、木桩、器材等），动员布置进行抢修。当决口或险工紧急时，群众往往失掉信心，这时领导上即很好的进行鼓励，提高了群众防汛堵险信心。在防汛抢修中，村与村之间因利害关系不一致，曾闹些意见，影响了抢修工作，领导上发觉后，马上进行了教育，解决了纠纷，使抢修工作顺利进行。（三）领导上掌握了不因小而失大的原则。宋下庄在抢修七百丈险工时（已修好三百丈），用了六七百根两手粗八尺长的木桩，一万斤秫秸，在物资上合算起来数目不小，但比起小漳河西堤决口，淹没菜园子地七顷，少收七万斤粮食要合算的多。在修筑土堆工作上，事前指示在空地排长沟或方坑，防止损伤禾苗。这样克服了群众以往为了抢修河堤，随时浪费物资和＠踏田苗的现象，同时也免去了水灾。
