Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has released the telegram from various democratic parties and democratic personages in Hong Kong to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong's reply telegram as follows:

(I) Telegram (Delayed) To Mr. Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, and to all compatriots in the Liberated Areas:

The Nanjing autocrat has seized power and sold out the country, an unprecedented act. Recently, he has colluded with American imperialism, attempting to deceive the world with a facade of democracy. While the people cannot be deceived, this usurpation of legitimacy cannot be tolerated. Now that the People's Liberation Army has arrived, and the people offer food and drink on the roads; now that the homeland is being recovered, it is imperative to decide on a major plan as soon as possible. We, looking at the situation both at home and abroad, are eager to advocate a plan. Upon reading the fifth item of your party's May 1st Labor Day slogan: "All democratic parties, people's organizations, and social notables should promptly convene a political consultative conference to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's representative assembly and the establishment of a democratic coalition government," it accords with the demands of the people and the current situation, and aligns with our own intentions. We are extremely admiring. In addition to informing all sectors at home and abroad, as well as overseas Chinese, to jointly promote the completion of this great cause, we hereby inform you and request your guidance.

Li Jishen, He Xiangning (Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang)
Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun (China Democratic League)
Ma Xulun, Wang Shao'ao (China Association for Promoting Democracy)
Chen Qiyou (Zhigong Party)
Peng Zemin (Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party)
Li Zhangda (China National Salvation Association)
Cai Tingkai (China Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association)
Tan Pingshan (Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades' Federation)
Guo Moruo (Non-Party) May 5th

(II) Reply Telegram To Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. He Xiangning, Mr. Shen Junru, Mr. Zhang Bojun, Mr. Ma Xulun, Mr. Wang Shao'ao, Mr. Chen Qiyou, Mr. Peng Zemin, Mr. Li Zhangda, Mr. Cai Tingkai, Mr. Tan Pingshan, Mr. Guo Moruo, and to all democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic personages in Hong Kong:

Your telegram of May 5th, due to transportation obstacles, has just been received. We are extremely admiring of you for endorsing our Party's May 1st proposal regarding the convening of a new political consultative conference, discussing and realizing the convocation of a people's representative assembly, and the establishment of a democratic coalition government, and for enthusiastically promoting its realization. Now the revolutionary situation is developing day by day, and all democratic forces should strengthen unity and work together to eliminate the reactionary forces in China as soon as possible, stop the aggression of American imperialism, and establish an independent, free, prosperous, and unified People's Republic of China. For this purpose, it is indeed necessary to convene representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic personages for joint consultation. Regarding the timing and location of convening this meeting, who should convene it, the scope of participants, and the issues to be discussed at the meeting, we hope that you and democratic personages from all walks of life across the country will jointly study and provide your insightful opinions. We would be most grateful. This telegram is in reply, and we hope for your understanding.

Chairman Mao Zedong, Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, August 1st

    南京独裁者窃权卖国，史无先例。近复与美帝国主义互相勾结，欲以伪装民主，欺蒙世界。人民虽未可欺，名器不容假借。当此解放军队所至，浆食集于道途；国土重光，大计亟宜早定。同人等盱衡中外，正欲主张。乃读贵党五一劳动节口号第五项：“各民主党派、各人民团体及社会贤达，迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府”，适合人民时势之要求，尤符同人等之本旨，何胜钦企。除通电国内外各界暨海外侨胞共同策进完成大业外，特此奉达，即希赐教。
