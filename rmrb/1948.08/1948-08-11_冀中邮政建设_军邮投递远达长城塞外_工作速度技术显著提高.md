Jizhong Postal Construction
　　Military Postal Delivery Reaches the Great Wall and Beyond
    Work Speed and Technology Significantly Improved
    [Jizhong News] Jizhong's postal construction has seen considerable improvements over the past year. To ensure contact between the front and rear and to bolster the morale of the soldiers, the Jizhong Postal Administration Branch established a military post office in each brigade in March 1946, responsible for the delivery of various documents, newspapers, and soldiers' letters. During the Daqing River North Campaign in August of last year, the Jizhong Post Office Support-the-Front Office was established to meet the needs of war support. Support-the-Front post offices were set up in each logistics command post, responsible for various communications, newspaper distribution, and the receipt and delivery of letters for civilian laborers and support-the-front cadres. In the six battles of Daqing River North, Baoding North, Qingfengdian, Shijiazhuang, the Northern Front, and Southern Chahar, military postal workers traveled with the army across plains, mountains, and even to the areas beyond the Great Wall; overcoming all difficulties to complete the task of supporting the front. According to incomplete statistics: a total of more than 9,000 urgent and general letters were received and delivered, and more than 54,000 copies of newspapers were distributed. The speed and technology of postal work have also improved significantly: after the postal bureaus in various regions vigorously adjusted their routes last spring, the speed generally increased. After the land reform, the implementation of day and night journeys, with people stopping but mail not stopping, immediately accelerated the speed. Taking the entire region as an example (excluding the Tenth Sub-district), before the land reform, it took up to four days to travel from the Jizhong Directly Subordinate Bureau to the various county bureaus. After the land reform, the longest distance (280 li) takes two days. Work efficiency has also generally improved, and errors have been greatly reduced. For example, the Hejian Bureau generally increased from registering 70 to 80 pieces per hour to more than 200 pieces, with a maximum of 250 pieces; and a re-examination system for collection and delivery was established. Before the establishment of the re-examination by the Jizhong Directly Subordinate Bureau, it received forty or fifty verification slips (i.e., misdirected mail) each month. After the establishment of the re-examination, there were less than five per month; Wenxin, Dacheng, and Xinle and Jianguo had no errors for three months. The postal workers who persisted in Daqing River North tenaciously continued their work in the face of constant enemy "sweeps," "suppressions," and "shaves and supports." Going back and forth at night has become commonplace. They not only completed the glorious delivery task of the postal workers but also continued to strike at the enemy. In the February anti-"sweep" alone, they fought eleven times, killing and wounding thirty enemies, and obtaining two rifles and forty rounds of ammunition.

　　冀中邮政建设
  　军邮投递远达长城塞外
    工作速度技术显著提高
    【冀中讯】冀中邮政建设，一年来已有不少改进。为了保证前后方的联系，巩固战士的斗志，一九四六年三月间，冀中邮政管理分局在每旅建立一个军邮局，担负起各种文件、报纸及战士信件的传递。去年八月大清河北战役时，适应战勤的需要，又建立了冀中邮局支前办公处。各后勤指挥所设有支前邮局，担负各种交通联系、报纸发行、民工及支前干部的信件收寄等。在大清河北、保北、清风店、石家庄、北线、察南等六次战役中，军邮随军踏遍平原、山地，以至长城塞外地区；克服了一切困难，完成支前任务。据不完整统计：共同收投递了急要的以及一般信件九千多件，发行报纸五万四千余份。邮政工作的速度及技术，也有显著提高：去春各地邮局大力调整线路后，速度普遍提高了一步，土改后实行日夜兼程、人停邮件不停的办法，速度立时加快。以全区论（不包括十分区），土改前自冀中直属局出发到各县局，最远的需四天。土改后，最远的（二百八十里）需二天。在工作效率上也已普遍提高，差错大大减少，如河间局，一般的从每点钟登记七八十件增至二百余件，最高二百五十件；并建立了收交接的复查制度。冀中直属局建立复查前，每月收到四五十个验单（即弄错的邮件），建立复查后，每月不足五个；文新、大城、新乐、建国三个月没出过错。坚持在大清河北的邮工们，在敌人不断“扫荡”“清剿”“剔扶”中，英勇顽强的坚持工作。夜来夜去，已成为平常的事情。他们不但完成了邮工光荣的传递任务，还不断打击敌人，仅二月反“扫荡”中，即战斗十一次，毙伤敌三十名，得大枪二支，子弹四十发。
