Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 8th, American imperialism is utilizing the so-called "economic aid" of 275 million US dollars to the Kuomintang government to expand the "trade" relationship between the Kuomintang government and Japan, in order to further transform China into a source of raw materials for Japan and a dumping ground for Japanese goods, allowing Japan to carry out aggression against China without restraint. The news stated: "Senior officials of the Economic Cooperation Administration stated that the economic aid of 275 million US dollars to China can be used directly by China, and also indirectly used to restore trade with Japan." The United States intends to use the so-called "Japanese industry will assist China's industrial construction" as a guise to have Japan supply the Kuomintang with some of its needs for the civil war. The news stated: The Economic Cooperation Administration is currently considering supplying Japan with Kailuan coal and iron ore stockpiled along the Yangtze River, and Japan will provide the Kuomintang government with railway parts and equipment, and import other goods into China. To this end, the agency has "quietly dispatched two people from the China branch to Japan for preliminary investigation." According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 9th, a statement made by the head of the agency's China branch, Lapham, at a press conference in Shanghai also confirmed this American plan. Lapham affirmed that China must "supply Japan with any raw materials."

  　美帝扩大蒋日贸易
   图变中国为日原料供应地和日货市场
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据中央社华盛顿八日合众电透露：美帝国主义正利用对国民党政府的二亿七千五百万美元的所谓“经济援助”，扩大国民党政府和日本的“贸易”关系，以便进一步变中国为日本原料供应地和日货倾销市场，让日本放手侵华。该消息称：美国“经济合作总署高级官员称：为数二亿七千五百万美元的经济援华款项，除由中国直接使用外，并可间接用以恢复日本贸易。”美国并打算以所谓“日本工业将辅助中国工业建设”名义，使日本供应国民党一部分内战需要。消息称：经济合作总署现正考虑以开滦煤和长江沿岸的存铁供应日本，日本则以铁路零件及设备供给国民党政府，并以其他货品输入中国。该署为此已“悄然自中国分署派遣两人赴日本作初步调查”。另据路透社上海九日消息：该署中国分署署长莱普汉在上海记者招待会上的谈话，亦证实了美国此项计划。莱普汉肯定声称：中国须“以任何原料供应日本”。
