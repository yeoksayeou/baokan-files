    [Taihang News] In the Second District of Ping Shun, the soil is poor and the harvest was bad last year, so the masses generally have very little grain in storage. The disaster has been serious since this spring. In order to organize production and overcome the disaster, the district convened a two-day meeting of village chiefs and branch secretaries to organize labor to go out and do hired labor. Their land would be cultivated by mutual aid teams, implementing a mutually beneficial approach. Militiamen could also go out to do hired labor, and upon arriving at the place where they were doing hired labor, they would write to the village to inform them. If a call to arms arrived, someone would be immediately sent to call them back. After returning, village cadres and party members in each village discussed and organized. In Chen Yi Village, a total of thirty-five laborers went out to do hired labor, leaving twenty-eight. Each hired labor day earns eight *jin* of rice in wages. The mutual aid team cultivates the land for those who go out to do hired labor, eating their food, with a wage of four *jin* of rice per labor day, totaling more than six *jin* per day. Both those doing hired labor outside and those engaged in mutual aid production benefit. Under the principle of mutual benefit, the district has organized and planned to extract 360 laborers to do hired labor. Each person averages twenty days, totaling 7,200 labor days. Each labor day earns 1,500 yuan (冀钞, Ji currency), for a total of 19,000,000 yuan. Yang Wei, an old man who went out to do hired labor, said, "My family has three people, and we originally had very little grain stored at home. This time, I went out to do hired labor for twenty days, which not only improved our lives but also earned a net profit of 30,000 yuan, which can buy one *shi* of corn at market price. My family will also harvest one *shi* of wheat in the summer harvest, so the whole family will not go hungry."
