[Taiyue Three-Day Telegram] Model Doctor Wu Hongxing gloriously sacrificed his life while participating in the war on the front lines. The Yangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party posthumously recognized him as a Communist Party member. Comrade Hongxing was from Nanciying, Yangcheng, and was 27 years old. In his childhood, he herded cattle and worked as a farmhand for landlords. After Yangcheng was liberated, he studied at the Fourth Prefectural Commissioner's Office Medical Training Class. He consistently demonstrated a high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for serving the people. Every time the militia set out, he always requested to go to the front lines. He participated in the Jinan Campaign last year and was highly praised by everyone. After the Quwo Campaign ended, he passed by his home on his way back to the county, but he didn't rest for long, concerned about the wounded and sick in the hospital, and quickly returned to the hospital. During his participation in the war, he treated the militia fighters like his own brothers. In treatment, he resolutely opposed the bureaucratic style of "slow doctors for urgent illnesses," and treated illnesses immediately. He understood that prevention was more important than cure. When he set out for Yuanqu to participate in the war, he was determined to do a good job of peacetime hygiene work. He universally established hygiene teams in the companies by platoon, carried out company hygiene movements, and supervised everyone to sun their quilts, wash their clothes, cut their nails, and clean their houses. When marching, he always sent people ahead to boil water so that the participating militia could have boiled water to drink as soon as they settled down. At night, he often went to each squad to check whether the militiamen had covered themselves with their quilts. He was very concerned about the interests of the masses. When garrisoned in Yiyang, the landlord was away from home for several days, so he fed the fellow villager's cattle for several days in a row. When the fellow villager returned and saw that the cow's belly was bulging, he was very grateful to him. He treated the illnesses of the masses in the new district with the same patience and gradually became familiar with the masses. He told them about the situation and policies of the liberated areas. At the commendation meeting after returning from participating in the war in western Henan, Comrade Hongxing was selected as a special-class model. On June 23, Comrade Hongxing gloriously sacrificed his life in the battle of Shiling Town, Yiyang, Henan.
