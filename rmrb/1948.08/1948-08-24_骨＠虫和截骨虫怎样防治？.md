　　How to Prevent and Control Rice Leaf Rollers and Rice Stem Borers?
    To the Editors:
    Most of the Second District of Ci County is paddy field. Some low-lying areas are not suitable for growing other plants due to waterlogging, and only rice can be planted. However, the masses are most afraid of pests, which causes great concern about growing rice, thinking that "the harvest of rice is unreliable." Please provide information on pest control methods to alleviate the concerns of the masses.
    Rice Leaf Roller: From the time the rice seedlings are transplanted until the "hot summer days," the temperature fluctuates between hot days and cold nights. If there is fog, a pest will appear in the morning, which the masses call "Rice Leaf Roller." This insect starts with moths laying eggs, which produce sticky silk on the rice leaves, similar to spider webs with stickiness. The worms emerge after three days. The shape of the worm: more than one finger long, as thick as a large incense stick. When eating the rice, it eats from the middle, rolling the rice leaf with the sticky substance to eat it. It eats mostly at night, and you can hear a rustling sound. After eating the rice, it turns into a moth and flies away in July. There is also another insect called "Rice Stem Borer." The shape of the insect is about the size of wheat, growing in the rice nodes, a white, fleshy worm. It eats from the inside out, drilling small holes while eating, consuming the liquid inside the rice, causing it to wither and die.
    The masses have tried several methods to control these two pests, but without success. The first method is to swat them with sticks, but the worms do not drown when they fall into the water and come back up after a while, eating on one side while being beaten on the other, failing to solve the fundamental problem. The second method is to sprinkle bran and lime powder on the seedlings, but this is also ineffective. The third method is to sprinkle kerosene water on the seedlings, but this is not only ineffective but also causes "oil drought." The fourth method is that the Japanese used a kind of liquid medicine here, but the masses do not know its name. It was sprayed with a tube, but it was also ineffective.
    What is the most effective method for eliminating these insects? I hope you can inform us.

    To the Editors:
    After planting garlic, the leaves near the roots turn yellow. Upon pulling them out, many small maggots are found in the roots. Many farmers were asked, and some said it was due to too much horse manure, which could be treated with black water; some said it was because the seeds were stored cold or in a house that was too hot, etc. There was no way to stop them from dying, so they had to be left to die, and it was said that this often happens. Please reply to what this problem is and how to prevent and control it. Cai Zhenyu
    Answer: Regarding the pest control methods for rice and garlic, Comrade Tian Huonong of the Department of Agriculture has replied as follows:
    (1) Rice Pests:
    1. The "Rice Leaf Roller" that wraps the leaves and eats the leaves is called the rice leaf roller, which the masses call rice silkworm. The simplest and most effective way to prevent and control it is to use two shoe soles to hit the leaf roll, killing the worms. Then, use a dung fork to open the leaf roll. Or first open the leaf roll to make the worms fall out, and then have someone kill the worms. Repeat this two or three times every few days to prevent it from becoming a disaster. If you can use arsenic stone, alkali powder, and lime water (one tael of arsenic ground into powder, four taels of good alkali powder, add two catties of water, boil in an iron pot for half an hour, and then add 220 catties of water), spray it on the rice leaves on a sunny day, and the rice leaf rollers will be poisoned and killed when they eat the leaves. The worms will gradually die after three to five days.
    2. The "Rice Stem Borer" is called the rice stem borer. The most effective way to prevent and control it is to dig up and burn the rice roots in winter, because the borer overwinters near the rice stalk roots. Secondly, lighting lamps at night in June and July and placing a basin of water under the lamp to lure and kill the moths is also effective, but it is too troublesome.
    (2) Garlic Root Maggots
    There is no experience with this pest yet. The masses may be able to prevent and control it with black water, but it has not been tested. Or use one tael of red arsenic ground into powder, mix it with 20 catties of wood ash (small ash), dig around the roots of each garlic plant, sprinkle the arsenic ash, cover with soil, and then water it to poison and kill them. - Editor

### 骨＠虫和截骨虫怎样防治？

专栏：询问与答复

　　骨＠虫和截骨虫怎样防治？
    编者同志：
    我们磁县二区大部分是水地，有些洼地种别的植物都不行，怕水淹，只有栽稻子可以，但是群众思想最怕的是生害虫，以致引起群众对种稻子顾虑很大，认为“种稻收成靠不住”。请将治虫办法介绍来，以解群众顾虑。
    骨＠虫：稻下秧后到“暑伏天”，白天一热黑夜一冷，若遇一个天雾，早晨就要产生一种害虫，群众称之为“骨＠虫”。此虫产生有蛾先产卵，到稻叶上屙出黏丝，黏丝与蜘蛛网相似，带有黏性，过三天就产生出来。虫的形状：一指多长，有大香那么粗，吃稻时是从中间吃的，将稻叶用黏质卷住食用，能吃的与水面平，吃时大部在晚上，还听见沙沙的响声。将稻子吃了没啥吃后，到七月就变成蛾飞去了。另外有一种虫叫“截骨虫”，虫形是麦子般大，生在稻骨节里，是白色肉虫，吃是从里边往外吃的，吃时还钻成小眼，将稻心液体吃光，就枯竭而死。
    对于这两种害虫，群众曾经用过几种办法，但无效。第一种是用棍子扑啦的，虫子落水后不能溺死，停时间又上来，打这边吃那边，不能解决基本问题。第二种，往苗上撒糠石灰面，但亦无效。第三种，用煤油水往苗上撒，不但无效，反而生“油旱”。第四种，日本鬼子在这里时用过一种药水，群众不知是什么名，用气管子打，但亦不管用。
    究竟此虫用什么方法除治有效？尚希见告。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　磁县二区张肇明编辑同志：
    种了蒜，靠根际的叶黄了，拔出来一看，根里长了很多小蛆。问了很多农民，有的说是马粪上的多了，可用黑水浇之；有的说是种子存时冷着或放的家太热等等。没有办法死了只好听其死，并且说这是经常有的。请答复这是什么毛病？怎样防治法？蔡贞余
    答：关于稻与蒜的虫害防治办法，已由农业厅田活农同志答复如下：
    （一）稻地虫：
    一、包叶子吃叶子的“骨＠虫”叫做稻苞虫，群众叫稻蚕，防除的办法最简单而收效较大的是：用两只鞋夹打叶苞，将虫夹死，随后用粪叉将叶苞挑开。或先将叶苞挑开使虫掉落，随后一人将虫弄死，过几天这样反复做两三回，即可防止成灾。如能用砷石、硷面、石灰水，（砷一两研成面，好硷面四两，加水二斤，在铁锅里熬半个钟头，然后再加水二百二十斤）晴天喷撒在稻叶上，稻蚕吃叶子即可毒杀。三五天后虫即逐渐死去。
    二、“截骨虫”叫做稻二化螟虫。防除最有效的办法是冬季刨稻根烧掉，因螟虫在稻秆根边过冬。其次是在六七月间晚上点灯，灯下搁一盆水，诱杀蛾子，也有效，不过太费事。
    （二）蒜根蛆
    这种害虫，现在还没有经验。群众用黑水防除，可能有效，但未试用。或用红砷一两研末，拌草木灰（小灰）二十斤，在每棵蒜根边锄开，把砷灰撒上，培上土，再浇水，即可毒杀。——编者
