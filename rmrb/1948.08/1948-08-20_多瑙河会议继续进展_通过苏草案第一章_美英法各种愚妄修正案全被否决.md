Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 18th: Comprehensive dispatches from TASS: The Danube Conference entered the stage of the comprehensive committee's review of the Soviet draft on the 9th, and by the 13th, the preface and the entire first chapter of the draft had been adopted, including the most important part of the draft agreement stipulating the basic principles of Danube navigation and the organization of the Danube Commission. All the clauses received unanimous support from the Danube countries, while the various amendments proposed by the United States, Britain, and France were all rejected. The representatives of the three countries only made various ugly performances at the meeting. For example, when discussing the preface of the Soviet draft, the United States proposed an amendment arguing that the autonomous rights of the Danube countries should only be given "appropriate attention," and at the same time, the "freedom" of navigation on the Danube should be guaranteed by "strictly abiding by the interests of all countries"; the preface should also include the phrase "This United Nations Charter aims to develop the economic welfare and peaceful relations of all countries in the Danube." Vyshinsky sternly refuted this, telling him that "the autonomous rights of the Danube countries should be recognized without reservation." He also pointed out that the five-nation treaty signed by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on March 17th did not mention the United Nations Charter in the development of economic relations, and the US amendment was an unnecessary affectation. When discussing Article 1 of the text, the US representative requested the addition of words like "preventing discrimination," and declared that its purpose was to "prevent imperialism from penetrating the Danube," which caused a burst of laughter at the meeting. Subsequently, the French representative suddenly insisted that the decision of the Foreign Ministers' Conference cited in the article was inconsistent with the original text. Vyshinsky immediately took out the document for verification, completely exposing the French representative's absurdity. When discussing Article 5 of the draft on the composition of the Danube Commission, the three non-Danube countries all wanted to squeeze into the commission and get a seat; the British representative even said that the Soviet Union was not a Danube country, and only Ukraine was a Danube country. However, when Vyshinsky took out a map for him to see, telling him that not only Ukraine but also Moldavia was along the Danube, the British representative was dumbfounded and didn't know what to say.

　　多瑙河会议继续进展
  　通过苏草案第一章
    美英法各种愚妄修正案全被否决
    【新华社陕北十八日电】综合塔斯社电讯：多瑙河会议自九日起进入综合委员会审查苏联草案阶段，迄十三日止，已通过草案序文及第一章全部，包括规定多瑙河通航与多瑙河委员会组织基本原则的草约最主要部分。所有条款都获得多瑙河国家一致的拥护，而美英法三国所提出的各种修正案，则全被否决，三国代表只是在会上出尽了种种丑态。如讨论苏联草案序文时，美国提出修正案主张：多瑙河各国的自主权利仅应予以“适当的注意”，同时应“恪遵一切国家的利益”而保证多瑙河航运的“自由”；序文并应加入“本联合国宪章以发展各国在多瑙河的经济福利与和平关系”字样。维辛斯基予以严正反驳，告诉他“应该毫无保留地承认多瑙河国家的自主权利”。并指出三月十七日签订的英、法、荷、比、卢五国条约，在发展经济关系上也没有说到联合国宪章，美国的修正案是不必要的装模作样。在讨论本文第一条时，美代表要求加上“防止歧视”一类的字样，并声明其目的在“防止帝国主义深入多瑙河”，结果引起了会议一阵哄笑。继之法国代表忽然硬说该条所引用的外长会议决定与原文不符。维辛斯基马上把文件拿出来对证，完全暴露了法国代表的愚妄。在讨论草案第五条关于多瑙河委员会的组成时，三个非多瑙河国家都想挤进委员会分一席之地；英国代表甚至说苏联也不是多瑙河国家，只有乌克兰才是多瑙河国家。但当维辛斯基拿出地图来给他看，告诉他，不但乌克兰而且莫达维亚也沿着多瑙河时，英国代表乃瞠目不知所对。
