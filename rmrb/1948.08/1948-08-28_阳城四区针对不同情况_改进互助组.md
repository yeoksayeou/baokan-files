　　Taiyue Telegram: Yangcheng Fourth District is reforming mutual aid groups based on different situations. The entire district (missing four villages) originally had 794 groups, most of which were organized through administrative orders, some according to established formations, and some according to geographical area. Many had unclear work accounts and poorly organized work sequences. After calling for voluntary association and equal exchange, and due to the lack of timely leadership and rectification, some existed in name only, with only a small portion still engaged in mutual aid. For example, out of 216 groups in Silians Village, 107 had disbanded. After the wheat harvest, rectification was resolutely carried out based on the principles of voluntary association and equal exchange. Groups formed by coercion were dissolved and reorganized; for general groups, a thorough understanding of the situation was gained before reforming them accordingly. For example, when rectifying Li Misheng's group in Sucun Village, wages were unclear, and due to the "poor peasant and hired laborer line" taken last winter, two Farmers' Association members were purged, causing emotional unrest. During this rectification, conversations were held separately with group members and the group leader to understand the situation. After discussions in a meeting, a consensus was reached, wages were cleared, with due payments made to those entitled. The two expelled members were immediately reinstated, and the mistakes were acknowledged. Everyone immediately had no objections and were willing to stay in the group, with Li Misheng re-elected as the group leader, and a joint plan was drawn up for the future. When rectifying Guo Tongqiang's group in Nanciying Village, because of disputes over the order of work, it was jointly discussed and stipulated that when hoeing, the land would be divided into portions, with each household hoeing one portion per day, taking turns so that no one's crops would be neglected. Everyone then had no objections. (One portion exchanged, walking to exchange land takes too much time, worth considering – Editor). From the wheat harvest to now, 33 groups have been rectified (missing statistics from Sanlian Village), and rectification is continuing.

　　阳城四区针对不同情况
  　改进互助组
    【太岳电】阳城四区根据不同情况改造互助组。全区（缺四个村）原有七百九十四个组，大部是依靠行政命令组织起来的，有的是按照编成，有的是按地区编成。其中工帐不清，做活次序搞不好的也不少。在号召自愿结合、等价交换后，又因没有及时领导整顿，一部分有名无实，只有小部分还在互助。如四联村二百一十六个组就散了一百零七个。麦收后，坚决根据自愿结合、等价交换原则进行整顿，强编的解散，重新结组；一般的先深入了解情况，再根据情况改造。如整顿苏村李密盛组时，工资不清，又因去冬走“贫雇路线”时清洗了两个农会会员，弄得情绪不安，这次整顿时，分别和组员组长谈话，了解情况后，又经开会讨论，取得一致意见，清理工资，该出的出，该得的得；开除的两个会员立即恢复，并承认了错误。大家马上没有了意见，还愿在一组，组长还是选上了李密盛，又共同订出今后计划。整顿南次营郭同枪组时，因为作活争先后，就共同讨论规定了锄地时分晌锄，每天每家锄一晌，挨次轮流，谁的庄稼也荒不了。大家也就没意见了。（一晌一换地，走路换地费时间太多，值得考虑——编者）。从麦收到现在，已整顿好三十三个组（缺三联村的统计），现继续整顿中。
