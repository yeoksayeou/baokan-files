　　Pingshan, Jingxing, and Huolu Twenty-two Villages Rush to Repair Canals in Preparation for Wheat Planting
    [Our Dispatch] The Yuanchuan Canal, irrigating twenty-two villages in Pingshan, Jingxing, and Huolu, with a length of thirty *li*, suffered severe damage during the heavy rains last month. The main canal was washed away, the canal bed was silted up, and the canal banks collapsed, totaling 311 *zhang*. The Pingshan-Jingxing-Huolu Yuanchuan Canal Water Conservancy Committee, in order to prepare for irrigating major crops after the autumn harvest and planting wheat in shaded areas after the White Dew solar term as early as possible, prepared straw and other materials before the rain. Immediately after the rain, they surveyed the canals, calculated the repair project (estimated to require 1,667 workdays, with wages of one *jin* of rice per *mu*), and notified the benefited villages to actively organize manpower to undertake repairs in sections. According to the person in charge of the canal: construction started on August 2nd, and the repairs can be completed in seven days. Within the boundaries of Huolu and Pingshan counties, there are three other canals irrigating 400 *qing* of land, which were more severely damaged by the water than Yuanchuan. However, the leadership has not actively taken measures to repair them after the rain, but instead simply "concentrates its efforts on rushing to collect" and is busy demanding water usage fees from the benefited households. According to Deputy Manager Xie of the canal, who told Section Chief Han of a certain section in Huolu: if we start repairing the canals now, we will not be able to concentrate our efforts on "collecting." Should we not start construction? But we are also afraid of delaying the planting of wheat in shaded areas before and after the White Dew solar term for the people. Even if we start construction now, it will not be completed until after the 20th. In the end, the problem was not resolved. It is reported that before the rain, the water usage fee was 6.5 *jin* of millet per *mu*. It is said that after the repairs are completed, 12,000 workdays will be required, and an additional 2 *jin* of wage rice per *mu* will need to be levied. As of August 1st, the general office of the three-canal water conservancy committee has not shown any signs of preparing to start construction. It is hoped that the person in charge of the canal will immediately pay attention to repairs and organize the masses to start construction.

　  平山井陉获鹿二十二村 　 赶修水渠准备种麦
    【本报讯】灌溉平山、井陉、获鹿二十二个村，长达三十里的源泉渠，在上月大雨中，干渠冲毁，渠身淤塞，渠埂陷塌，计达三百十一丈。平（山）井（陉）获（鹿）源泉渠水利委员会，为及早准备秋后浇灌大庄稼及白露后阴地种麦，在雨前除准备好秸料器材外，雨后立即勘察渠道，核算补修工程，（计需日工一六六七个，每亩按一斤米摊派工资米），通知各受益村，积极组织人力分段承修。据该渠负责人谈：八月二日动工抢修，七天即可抢修完毕。在获鹿、平山两县境内，另有浇地四百顷的三条水渠，被水冲毁较源料更为严重，但是领导上在雨后尚未积极设法抢修，反单纯“集中力量突击征收”，忙于向各受益户索使水费。据该渠谢副经理向获鹿某科韩科长表示：如现在开工整修渠道，便不能集中力量“征收”还不开工吧？又怕误老百姓白露前后阴地种麦，即现在开工还需二十以后才能完工，以后问题终未能解决。按雨前该使水用费每亩需纳小米六斤半，据说雨后完成修补，需工一万二千个，每亩还需续摊工资米二斤。迄八月一日止，该三渠水利委员会总会，还未有任何准备动工迹象。希望该渠负责方面立即注意抢修，组织群众动工。
