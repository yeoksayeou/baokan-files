The spy, named Robert D. Dreyer, was a captain and assistant naval attache at the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union. On April 23rd, while Dreyer was receiving secret military intelligence from a customs employee in a room at the Moscow Customs office, he was captured by Soviet security personnel, and all incriminating documents were seized on the spot. According to the confessions of both individuals, they were involved in receiving and transmitting secret military intelligence, and admitted that this was the second time they had done so since January of this year. In response, the Soviet Foreign Ministry immediately notified the U.S. Embassy that Dreyer had been discovered engaging in espionage activities and should leave the Soviet Union immediately. Due to the conclusive and irrefutable evidence, the U.S. Embassy did not express any objections and agreed to the Soviet request.
