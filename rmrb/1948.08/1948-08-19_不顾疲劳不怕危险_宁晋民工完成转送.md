【Pingbao Frontline Communication】In the current Pingbao Campaign, the laborers from Ningjin County, Hebei Province, completed 100% of their transfer tasks. During the Battle of Xushui, Wang Tongquan, a newly liberated peasant from the sixth squad of the first company of laborers in the county, went to the frontline dressing station three times, requesting the responsible comrade to allow him to carry the wounded from the front lines. Chen, a nineteen-year-old newly liberated peasant from the first company, insisted on carrying wounded soldiers six times, a round trip of 120 li, despite being sick and not eating for a day. When the squad leader tried to stop him, he said that being sick was nothing; the task must be completed. Labor hero Wang Zhijia had a severe eye disease, and the instructor told him to rest, but he insisted on carrying stretchers six times. Squad leader and Communist Party member Liu Shuangshun, due to the urgency of the task, tied two ropes together, carrying the load of two people. Liang Yude, a newly liberated peasant from the seventh squad, completed six transfer tasks using the same method. Instructor and cook Xu Jungang, who went to the front lines to deliver food, seized the opportunity to help transfer the sick and wounded. When the enemy bombed, laborer Bai Baohe camouflaged the wounded soldiers well and took care of them nearby. Fearing that the wounded would spit phlegm on themselves, he caught it with his hands, deeply moving the wounded soldiers. When it rained, Li Quanju, fearing that the wounded and their wounds would get wet, covered the wounded with all his clothes and straw hat. In the post-battle summary, more than 50% of the laborers in the county were praised by the brigade and company.

　　不顾疲劳不怕危险
  　宁晋民工完成转送
    【平保前线通讯】冀中宁晋民工于此次平保战役中百分之百完成转送任务。徐水战斗中，该县民工一连六班翻身农民王通全，连着往前线绷扎所去了三次，向负责同志请求，让他上火线去抬伤员。一连十九岁的翻身农民陈某，病的一天没有吃饭，还坚持抬了六次伤员，往返共一百二十里。班长不让他去，他说有病不算什么，任务一定要完成；民工功臣王智甲，眼病很厉害，指导员叫他去休息，他坚持抬了六次担架。班长共产党员刘双顺，因任务紧急，就把绳子拴好，一个顶两个担，七班翻身农民梁玉德，用同样办法，完成六次转送任务，指导员和上前线送饭的炊事员徐俊刚，抓紧机会帮助病员转送；民工白宝和在敌机轰炸时，把伤员伪装好后，自己就在旁边照顾着。怕伤员把痰吐在身上，就用手接着，伤员异常感动。下雨时，李全居怕湿了伤员和伤口，把自己的衣服草帽全给伤员盖上，战后总结该县民工百分之五十以上受到大队及连的表扬。
