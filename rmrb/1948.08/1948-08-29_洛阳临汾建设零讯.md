　　News Briefs on Construction in Luoyang and Linfen
    Luoyang City District Governments recently inspected the production situation after providing loans to the poor: Among the 242 poor households in the First District who received loans, 188 households, accounting for over 77.6% of the total number of loan recipients, earned enough within a month to maintain their livelihood and preserve their original capital; 54 households maintained their family life but lost some of their capital, accounting for over 22.3% of the households. Generally, those who only accepted local currency (the people's currency) in transactions made money, while those who wanted Kuomintang currency generally suffered from the plummeting value of the Kuomintang currency.
    In Linfen, Shanxi, some of the more than 5,000 civilian houses destroyed by the enemy have been rebuilt. The Municipal People's Hospital recently opened, offering free consultation and registration to citizens; the very poor are exempt from medical expenses; street vendors have been relocated to the new market for business, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau has established a Yumin Coal Station in the city, transporting 100,000 catties of coal daily, half of which is sold to citizens and factories at cost. The water supply plant has increased its water supply daily due to the resolution of fuel issues.

　　洛阳临汾建设零讯
    洛阳市各区区政府最近检查贫民贷款以后生产情形：一区得货款贫民二百四十二户中，一个月内赚到了一家的生活又保持了原来本钱的有一百八十八户，占贷款总户数百分之七十七点六强；维持了家庭生活，但赔了部分本钱的有五十四户，占户数百分之二二点三强。凡是在交易时只要本币不要蒋币的一般都赚了钱，反之要蒋币的一般都受蒋币暴跌的害。
    山西临汾被敌拆毁之五千余间民房，部分已重新建立。市立民众医院已于最近开张，市民治病免收出诊、挂号费；特别贫苦者免收医药费；散布街头之摊贩已迁入新市场营业，工商局在城内设立裕民炭站，每日运入十万斤煤炭，以一半按成本售予市民及工厂。自来水厂因燃料问题解决，供水量日增。
