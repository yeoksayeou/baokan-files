[Taiyue Electric] The famous Wang Yonghou mutual aid brigade in Siyuan Village, Qinshui, after in-depth inspection, changed its organizational form and reorganized into small mutual aid groups based on natural villages. Siyuan Village is composed of four mountain villages: Wangjiayuan, Majiayuan, etc. In the past, the entire village was organized into a large mutual aid team. Relying on careful planning by the leadership, it saved some labor and played a role. After an in-depth inspection this spring, it was found that this large-scale mutual aid form was not suitable for scattered mountain villages. Concentrating people wasted a lot of time; unified work allocation was both time-consuming and not thorough; although the work point system was used, because the number of people was too large, the settlement of accounts was inconvenient, resulting in some wage arrears and inequality; in addition, there was not much large land, and more people resulted in wasted labor, and eating was also inconvenient. In short, using the large team form in small mountain villages had more disadvantages than advantages. Therefore, it was decided to change the organizational form and organize small mutual aid groups based on natural villages, with groups ranging from three to five people to a dozen people (Not only is the large team form wrong for small mountain villages, but the pursuit of the large team form is also wrong in large villages and plains. Mutual aid should only be organized according to the actual situation and requirements of the masses, large or small. If it is better not to organize, then do not organize. The pursuit of a fixed large team form is formalism and should be corrected - Editor). This small group completely overcame the above shortcomings and facilitated supporting the front and participating in the war, as well as absorbing women into production. This year, the task of supporting the war is more arduous than in the past, but it is very convenient for the small groups to take turns going out, and sowing and weeding have been completed on time. If a family's man goes out to war, the women in the family will naturally ask to join the mutual aid group. The women's mutual aid group in Houjiayuan, led by Wen Guanlan, weeded the millet and corn at home, and also earned two *shi* and one *dou* of rice by weeding seedlings outside. Each group settles accounts once every half month (or one month). The method of calculating work points adopts the past method of dividing work according to tasks and recording work points according to points. Each group accepts the good experience of dealing with surplus labor in the past, calculates labor needs in the fields carefully, leaves the required manpower, and sells the surplus labor outside. Before weeding the seedlings, they organized cattle labor to plow the land outside, and bought more than ten *shi* of grain. Now they have also drawn seventeen people to sell labor outside. Nearly 2,000 *mu* of autumn land in the entire village have been weeded twice in a timely manner, and now they have begun to weed a third time.

    追求大队形式错了
    四园村改组小型互助
    【太岳电】沁源四园村著名的王永厚互助大队，经过深入检查，改变组织形式，以自然村为单位，改组成小型互助组。四园村系王家园、马家园等四个山庄合成，过去全村组织了一个大互助队，依靠领导上的周密计划，曾省了一些工，起过一些作用。今春经过深入检查，发现这种大规模互助形式很不适合分散的山庄。集中时耽误时间很多；统一拨工，既误时间，又不周到；虽然使用了工票制度，但因人数太多，结算帐不方便，也就有些工资拖欠不清，造成了不等价；加以大块地不多，人多了反倒费工，吃饭也不方便，总之，在小山庄用大队的形式，坏处多好处少，因此决定改变组织形式，以自然村为单位，组织小型互助组，人数三五人到十来人不等（不但小山庄用大队形式是错误的，就是在大村庄平原追求大队形式也是错误的，对互助只能根据群众实际情况和要求，大就大，小就小，如果不组织为好，就不组织，追求固定的大队形式是形式主义，应纠正——编者）。这种小型组完全克服了上述缺点，并便于支前参战和吸收妇女参加生产。今年参战任务较过去繁重，但小组轮流倒换出去很方便，下种锄苗都按时完成了。谁家男人出去了，家里的妇女很自然的就会要求参加互助组。侯家园温官兰妇女互助组把家里谷子玉茭都锄了，还出外锄苗赚回两石一斗米，各组半月（也有一月的）算帐一次，计工办法采用过去的按活计分，按分记工，各组接受过去处理余工的好经验，严密计算地里生活，留下需要的人工，多余的劳力就出外卖晌。锄苗前组织牛工出外犁地，就购了十来石粮食，现又抽出十七人出外卖晌，全村近二千亩秋地，都及时锄过二遍，现已开始锄三遍。
