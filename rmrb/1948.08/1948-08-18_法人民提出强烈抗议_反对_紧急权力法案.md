Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 16th: Reports from various sources: The newly-formed French government under André Marie, using the pretext of needing to "stabilize" the financial situation, submitted a so-called "Emergency Powers Act" to parliament on the 6th of this month, drafted by the notorious reactionary Finance Minister René Mayer. It demands that the government be given full power over the state's economic system (ranging from destroying nationalization plans to arbitrary layoffs). The French parliament, dominated by reactionaries, passed the bill on the 11th after making "certain literal modifications" (AFP). The French Communist Party's newspaper, "l'Humanité," sharply criticized the bill on the 7th, pointing out that "this bill completely deprives the parliament of its basic rights and undermines the foundations of the nation's political life." The government can now freely fire employees and arbitrarily change the government budget. "l'Humanité" emphasized that Mayer's plan is actually preparing "to transfer nationalized industries to French and foreign capitalists," thereby undermining the nationalization plan. The government's so-called tax reform will impose an additional 100 billion francs in taxes on small industrialists and small businessmen. It is also reported that the French working people have strongly protested against this plan. The General Confederation of Labor, the General Confederation of Artisan Workers, and others have passed resolutions condemning this plan. Coal miners in the northern French provinces of Nord, etc., have also held protest strikes.

　　法人民提出强烈抗议
  　反对“紧急权力法案”
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：新上台的法国马利政府借口需要“稳定”财政形势，于本月六日向议会提出由著名反动派财政部长雷诺拟订的所谓“紧急权力法案”，要求给予政府以独裁国家经济制度（大而破坏国有化计划，小而到任意裁员）的全权。反动派占优势的法议会，于略作“某些字面上的修改”（法新社）后，于十一日将该案通过。法共机关报“人道报”于七日尖锐抨击这一法案，指出“这一法案完全剥夺了国会的基本权利，破坏了国家政治生命的根基。”政府从此可以随意开革雇员，随意改变政府预算。人道报强调指出雷诺计划实际上准备“将国有化工业转交给法国及外国的资本家”，从而破坏国有化计划。政府的所谓税务改革，将加给小工业家和小商人的额外税款达一千亿法郎。又悉，法国劳动人民已对此一计划提出强烈抗议。法国总工会、手艺工人总工会等已通过决议谴责此一计划。法国北部诺尔等省煤矿工人并举行抗议罢工。
