    Xinhua News Agency, Xiangyang Front, 31st: Since the Xiangfan campaign began, American-made enemy aircraft have been indiscriminately bombing the city and its surroundings. Preliminary investigations reveal that approximately 300 merchants, civilians, and students were killed or wounded in Xiangfan during the fighting. Wang Shuliang, a teacher at Zhongshan Street Elementary School, had all five of his children killed by the bombing, and he and his wife were injured. A family of five who had moved from Laohekou were all killed by bombs. After the liberation of Xiangyang, enemy aircraft intensified their savage bombing, causing severe damage to the urban area. In Yin Village outside the east gate, hundreds of bombs and more than 30 incendiary bombs were dropped, and the village was strafed for 40 minutes, reducing the entire village to ashes.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 3rd: After the People's Liberation Army liberated Xiangyang, they immediately provided medical treatment and repatriation for wounded Kuomintang officers and soldiers. On the second day after capturing Xiangyang, the PLA medical team applied medicine and bandages to all wounded enemy officers and soldiers, and concentrated more than 700 seriously wounded soldiers in Xiaobeimen Hospital and Ximenli Catholic Church Hospital for treatment. At the same time, they also provided these seriously wounded soldiers with large quantities of flour to ensure their nutrition during treatment. In addition, each person was given 220,000 Chiang coins. Another 1,174 lightly wounded officers and soldiers were given travel expenses and sent home. Li Ailin, the heavy machine gun company commander of the 15th Pacification Zone Headquarters, who was wounded and treated, said: "If the People's Liberation Army hadn't applied medicine to me, I probably wouldn't have survived. I am sorry to the People's Liberation Army, I should have surrendered earlier." Che Guozhang, the company commander of the 4th company of the 1st battalion of the 14th regiment of the 104th brigade, who was wounded and rescued, said: "I will never forget the benevolence of the People's Liberation Army, even in death. After returning to Sichuan, I will persuade relatives and friends to never join the Central Army."
    Taiyue Telegram: The Taiyue Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently released more than 340 officers, soldiers, and special agents of Chiang's Youth Army 206th Division and local bandits from Xin'an County, Henan, who were captured in the Battle of Luoyang. Among them were Zhi Gang, a lieutenant colonel instructor of the Youth Army 206th Division, Da Yi, a major officer, and Wu, a major and commander of the military police corps of Xin'an County, Henan Province. Before their capture, they expressed great gratitude for the PLA's magnanimity and forgiveness.

    蒋机狂炸襄樊死伤市民数百
    【新华社襄阳前线三十一日电】襄樊作战以来，美制敌机即在城内外滥施轰炸。据初步调查，在作战期间襄樊市内被炸死炸伤的商民学生达三百人左右。中山街小学教员王树良的五个孩子都被炸死，王与其妻受伤。从老河口搬来的一家五口人都死在炸弹之下。襄阳解放后敌机更大肆狂炸，城区损失惨重。关东关外的尹庄一村，投落炸弹数百枚，燃烧弹三十余枚，并被扫射四十分钟之久，全村化为灰烬。
    【新华社中原三日电】解放军于解放襄阳后，对受伤的国民党军官兵立即进行医疗及遣送工作。攻克襄阳的第二日，解放军医疗队就给所有负伤敌军官兵上了药和绷带，并把其中七百多名重伤号，集中在小北门医院和西门里天主堂医院治疗的同时也给这些重伤号大批面粉，以照顾其在治疗期间的营养。此外每人又发给蒋币二十二万。另有一千一百七十四名轻伤官兵，则发给路费、遣送回家。负伤获治的第十五绥区司令部重机枪连连长李艾麟说：“要不是解放军给我上药，恐怕就活不成了。我对不起解放军，应该早早缴枪才好”。另一个负伤被救的一零四旅十四团一营四连连长车国章说：“解放军的仁德，我死也忘不了，回到四川后要劝说亲友，绝对不当中央军。”
    【太岳电】人民解放军太岳军区，顷释放解放洛阳战役中被俘之蒋青年军二零六师及匪河南新安等地团队官兵及特工人员三百零四十余名，其中包括青年军二零六师中校教导官之刚、少校军官的大一、河南省新安县军警总队少校和总队长午等。他等被俘前对解放军宽大为怀，不究既往，表示十分感激。
