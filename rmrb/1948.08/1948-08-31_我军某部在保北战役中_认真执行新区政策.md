　　【Jizhong Telegram】A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, due to frequent education on New District policies, has largely transformed the erroneous thinking of treating the New District as a "colony." Therefore, when participating in the Ping-Bao battle this time, discipline was extremely strict. No one in the 1st Company, 7th Company, or the 2nd Platoon of the 4th Company violated discipline. When the 1st Platoon of the 7th Company stayed in the house of a landlord in Zhao Village, the landlord's whole family had run away long ago. The furnishings in the house were very good. There was a calico quilt on the kang, and some good clothes. Squad Leader Li Shuzeng immediately explained the New District policy to everyone again, and they did not touch a single thing belonging to the landlord. When the 6th Company was building fortifications in Lao Li Village, the Deputy Platoon Leader of the 2nd Platoon took the 6th Squad to find door panels. Seeing that no one was home, the Deputy Platoon Leader immediately found the puppet Bao office and borrowed the first door through the puppet office personnel. The 2nd Platoon of the 6th Company stayed in the house of the puppet Bao chief in a certain village, and no one rummaged through things. Zhou Yibo, the cultural instructor of the 6th Company, took several soldiers to Beida Village to mobilize civilian laborers. The puppet Bao chief brought several large white flour steamed buns and insisted that he eat them. Comrade Zhou refused and explained to him: "We are the army of the people and cannot casually eat the people's things." Li Rong tied up the crops that were knocked down by digging fortifications, one by one. Luo Huyu, Liu Fengqi, and others publicized our Party's and our army's policies as soon as they arrived at the駐地。 A businessman in a certain village, not understanding our army, threw down several million Chiang currency and several packages of clothes and ran away. Dong Zhanyuan, Liu Ying, and others from the Special Service Company automatically saved them for him and brought him back to return them to him. In the implementation of the prisoner of war policy, not only was no insult made to prisoners, but timely explanations were also given to stabilize the prisoners' emotions. After the troops entered a certain place, they captured two soldiers from the puppet "Encirclement and Suppression" 2nd Brigade. After education, they were immediately released. The 6th Company captured more than one hundred prisoners. Some prisoners wanted to hand over their baggage. The Deputy Political Instructor of the company said: "As long as they are not weapons or military supplies, whatever private items they have, no matter how many treasures there are, we don't want them." Liberated soldier Niu Fengcai used his own personal experience to explain our army's lenient policy to the prisoners. A prisoner gave soldiers Wen Guoliang and Lu Wancai cigarettes and a flashlight. They resolutely refused, and said kindly: "This is the discipline of the People's Liberation Army." A wounded prisoner, after we applied medicine to him, was afraid that no one would take care of him if it rained because the sky was cloudy, so he cried. The soldiers explained to him, saying that they guaranteed to carry him down, and covered him with a quilt and a kerchief on his head, so he stopped crying. The 7th Company found a prisoner in the sorghum field. Due to everyone's enthusiastic explanation to him, he called back four more people.

　　我军某部在保北战役中
  　认真执行新区政策
    【冀中电】解放军某部由于经常进行新区政策教育，大部同志都转变了把新区看作“殖民地”的错误思想，因此参加这次平保战役时，纪律至为严明。该部一连、七连和四连二排没有一个犯纪律的。七连一班在赵村一个地主家住时，那个地主全家早跑光了，屋子里陈设很好，炕上有大洋布花被，还有一些好衣裳，一排长李树增马上再向大家讲解新区政策，房东的东西一丝也没动。六连在老李村修工事时，二排副带着六班去找门板，见一家没人，二排长马上找到伪保公所，通过伪办公人员，才把第一道门借去。六连二排在某村住在伪保长家里，没有一个人翻找东西。六连文化教员周绎波，带着几个战士到北达村动员民工，伪保长拿来了几个大白面馒头，非叫他吃不行，周同志拒绝了，并向他解释说：“俺们是老百姓的军队，不能随便吃老百姓的东西”。李荣把挖工事弄倒的庄稼，一把把的绑起来。罗虎禹、刘凤岐等到了驻地就宣传我党我军政策。某村一个商人因不了解我军，扔下几百万蒋币和好几包衣裳跑了，特务连的董占元、刘英等自动给他保存起来，并把他找回，如数交还他。在执行俘虏政策上，不但做到了不侮辱俘虏，还及时进行解释，安定俘虏情绪。部队进入某地，捉住了伪“清剿”二大队的两个士兵，经过教育，立即释放了。六连捉住了一百多俘虏，有的俘虏想把包袱缴了，该连副政指说：“只要不是武器、军用品，凡是私人的，就是有多少宝贝东西，我们也不要。”解放战士牛凤财以自己亲身体验，向俘虏解释我军宽大政策。一个俘虏给战士温国良、卢万财纸烟和手电筒，他们坚决不要，还和气的说：“这是解放军的纪律。”一个伤俘经我们上药后，因为天阴，他怕下雨没人管他，便哭起来。战士们一边给他解释，说明保证抬下他去；一边又给他盖上了个被子，头上蒙了一个包袱皮，他不哭了。七连在高粱地里搜出来一个俘虏，由于大家热情的给他解释，他又喊回来了四个人。
