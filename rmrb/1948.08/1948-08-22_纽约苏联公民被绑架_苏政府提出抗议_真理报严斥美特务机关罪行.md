Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. TASS reports: Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, visited US Undersecretary of State Lovett in Washington on the 9th, lodging a protest with the US government in a note regarding the kidnapping of Soviet citizen Mrs. Kasenkina, Mr. and Mrs. Samarin and their three children by White Russian bandits in New York on July 30th. The note protests the US government's permission of such atrocities by anti-Soviet bandits, and demands that the US government immediately take action to release Samarin and his family, who are still being held. In his reply, Lovett refused Ambassador Panyushkin's request, using the excuse of not knowing Samarin's current whereabouts. On the 11th, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov summoned US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith in Moscow, protesting on behalf of the Soviet government the crimes of the American authorities in condoning crimes against Soviet citizens, demanding the immediate restoration of Samarin and others' freedom, and the punishment of the murderers. At the same time, the Soviet Pravda also published an article entitled "The Kidnapping of Soviet Citizens in Broad Daylight in New York Arouses the Anger and Protest of the Entire Soviet People," sternly criticizing the shameless crimes of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation's secret service in colluding with White bandits to kidnap Soviet citizens.

　　纽约苏联公民被绑架
    苏政府提出抗议
  　真理报严斥美特务机关罪行
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社报导：苏联驻美大使潘友新于九日在华盛顿访唔美副国务卿罗维特，就苏联公民柯森金娜夫人、萨马林夫妇及其三子于七月三十日在纽约被白俄匪徒绑架事，向美国政府提出抗议的照会。照会中对美政府允许反苏匪徒的这种暴行，表示抗议，并要求美政府立即采取行动，释放现尚在被绑架中的萨马林及其家属。罗维特在其答词中，以不知萨马林现在何处为狡辩的借口，拒绝了潘大使的要求。十一日，苏外长莫洛夫乃于莫斯科邀见美驻苏大使史密斯，代表苏联政府抗议美国当局纵容对苏联公民的罪行，要求立即恢复萨马林等人的自由，并惩办凶手。同时，苏联真理报亦以“苏联公民在纽约光天化日之下被绑架的消息引起全苏联人民的愤怒与抗议”为题，严词抨击美联邦调查局特务机关勾结白党匪徒绑架苏联公民的无耻罪行。
