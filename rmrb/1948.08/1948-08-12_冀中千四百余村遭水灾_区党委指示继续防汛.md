　　Central Hebei: Over 1,400 Villages in Central Hebei Suffer Floods
　　Regional Party Committee Directs Continued Flood Prevention

　　[Central Hebei Electric Dispatch] In late July, river waters in various parts of Central Hebei surged, and the Hutuo River and Zhurong River breached their banks, causing flooding in many areas. According to surveys in the Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Sub-districts, more than 1,400 villages (including those in sixteen counties) suffered from varying degrees of flooding, with the Ninth Sub-district experiencing the most severe disaster. In approximately one-third of the affected villages, most of the crops were submerged; in many villages, some or most of the houses collapsed, and in the most severely affected villages, all the houses were washed away. The affected population is estimated to be around one million.

　　Since the river waters surged, many leading organs and River Affairs Bureau cadres have actively organized and led the masses in protecting dikes and conducting emergency repairs, achieving significant results, reducing the affected area, and protecting the property of the broad masses. This is good. However, examining the reasons for the heavy disaster, in addition to the objective factor of excessive flooding, the subjective efforts of some areas in leading and actively preventing floods were insufficient. There was ideological 麻痹 and negligence regarding flood prevention, believing that this year would be dry with low river levels. Dikes, as well as weak spots, water eyes, and holes, were not thoroughly inspected according to the decisions of the Central Hebei Flood Prevention Conference (Li County did not conduct a thorough inspection, and more than 700 water eyes appeared), thus preventing some avoidable disasters from being prevented.

　　Currently, it is still the season of rising river waters. The Central Hebei Regional Party Committee has issued an emergency directive on production, disaster relief, and continued flood prevention. It points out: (1) Areas that may be affected should continue to intensify flood prevention, and places where breaches are possible should be repaired. Where breaches have already occurred, repairs should be carried out under the principles of subordinating local interests to overall interests and facilitating wheat planting, based on the actual situation, with planning, focus, and gradual steps to lead the masses. In flooded areas, embankments should be built. (2) Production relief should be carried out in disaster areas. Those who are without clothing, food, or shelter should be quickly resettled and provided with relief. Farmers who are truly unable to repair or build houses should be provided with government loans, and the masses should be called upon to carry out self-reliance movements. Past water conservancy loans and funds that have not been lent out in non-disaster areas, as well as funds recovered after lending, should be quickly adjusted by the government, and the focus of lending should be shifted to disaster areas. Organize the masses in disaster areas to vigorously develop production by combining existing financial resources with loans. Those with the conditions to plant should quickly plant vegetables and buckwheat, and fully prepare to plant wheat. At the same time, it is necessary to organize the masses for cooperation and mutual assistance and develop sideline production. To complete the above tasks, leading cadres at all levels must effectively grasp leadership, conduct thorough inspections at any time, and promptly solve difficulties; those who have achieved success in leading this work should be promptly commended, and those who are passive and neglectful should be given criticism, education, or punishment.

　　冀中千四百余村遭水灾
  　区党委指示继续防汛
    【冀中电】七月下旬，冀中各地河水暴涨，滹沱河、潴龙河决口，出漕的地方很多。据八、九、十一分区调查，遭受轻重水灾的村庄达一千四百余个（包括十六个县），其中又以九分区水灾最重。被灾村中庄稼大部被淹的约占三分之一；不少村庄房屋倒塌一部和大部，个别灾情最重的村庄房屋被冲完。受灾人口约在一百万左右。
    自河水暴涨后，许多领导机关和河务局干部，积极组织领导群众护堤抢险，获得很大成绩，减少了受灾面积，保护了广大群众的财产，这是好的。但检查这次遭受重灾的原因，除客观上的洪水过大外，在主观上，有些地区的领导上主动、努力防汛还很不够，思想上认为今年天旱河干水小，对防汛麻痹忽视，对堤防及浪窝、水眼、穴洞等未认真按照冀中防汛会议的决定好好检查（蠡县未认真检查、水眼出现了七百多个），因而使某些可以避免的灾害未能防止。
    目前仍是河水涨发时期，冀中区党委特发出生产救灾与继续防泛的紧急指示。指出：（一）可能受灾区应继续加紧防汛，某些可能溃决地方，应加以修补。已溃决处，应在局部利益服从整个利益及有利种麦的原则下，根据实际情况，有计划、有重点、有步骤的领导群众进行抢修。在漫水地区，应打堤埝。（二）应进行灾区的生产救济。对灾民无衣、无食、无住者应迅速安置救济。真正无力修盖房屋之农民，政府应贷款扶助，并号召群众开展自救运动。过去水利贷款和非灾区未贷下去的款，以及贷后收回之款，由政府迅速调剂，把贷款重点转向灾区。组织灾区群众将现有之财力结合贷款，大力开展生产。有条件下种的要迅速种蔬菜、荞麦，并充分准备种麦。同时要组织群众合作互助，开展副业生产。为完成上述任务，各级领导干部必须切实抓紧领导，随时深入检查，及时解决困难；对此工作领导有成绩者及时表扬，消极怠工者应给予批评教育或处分。
