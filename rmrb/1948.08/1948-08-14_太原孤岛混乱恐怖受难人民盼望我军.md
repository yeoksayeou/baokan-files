　　【Taihang Electric】Taiyuan City, the only isolated island in central Shanxi left by the Yan bandit, is currently in a state of extreme chaos and terror. The sharp drop in Taiyuan Chiang Kai-shek currency and the soaring prices are racing against the Yan bandit's military defeats. According to the Taiyuan People's Daily on July 12: "After negotiation in the city, the black market price of pork has reached 2.8 million yuan per kilogram, and the market price of beans, eggplants, etc. has also doubled compared with the previous days." The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao reported from Taiyuan that watermelons, which are considered summer gifts, cost 3 million yuan each for about four kilograms. Particularly difficult is that Taiyuan is now experiencing a severe water shortage, and citizens mostly drink bitter water. The Yan bandit's brutal rule has also intensified. On July 16, after the Yan bandit's Frontline Daily issued a bloody rant to "eliminate those who raise prices and endanger people's livelihoods," citizens Guo Tianfu (from Qi County) and engineer corps soldier Wang Suozhu (from Qingyuan) were slaughtered under the charge of "colluding with bandits." Citizens Wang Changgui (from Wuxiang) and Guo Sanyuan (from Yuci) were executed for inciting people and disrupting public order. The people of Taiyuan are placed by the Yan bandit in deeper disaster and terror, yearning day and night for our army to liberate the city.

　　太原孤岛混乱恐怖受难人民盼望我军
    【太行电】阎匪残留于晋中的唯一孤岛太原城，目前已陷于极度混乱和恐怖。太原蒋钞之猛跌，物价之上涨，正与阎匪军事上的惨败赛跑。据七月十二日太原民众日报载：“市内议价后，黑市猪肉每斤已达二百八十万元，豆角茄子等市价亦较日前高出一倍”。天津大公报载太原消息谓：作为夏天恩物的西瓜每个约四斤，价达三百万元。特别困难的是太原现已发生严重水荒，市民多挑苦水吃。阎匪的残暴统治也更加剧。七月十六日，阎匪阵中日报发出“对提高物价，危害民生者予以铲除”的血腥狂吠后，便有市民郭天辅（祁县人）及工兵团士兵王锁柱（清源人）以“通匪”罪名遭屠杀。市民王长贵（武乡人）、郭三元（榆次人）以煽动人心、扰乱治安罪名被处死刑。太原人民被阎匪置于更深的灾难与恐怖中，日夜盼我军解放该城。
