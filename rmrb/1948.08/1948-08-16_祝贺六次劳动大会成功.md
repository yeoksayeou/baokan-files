　　Congratulations on the Success of the Sixth National Labor Congress
    Telegram of Congratulations from the North China Central Bureau

    [Our Newspaper News] The North China Central Bureau of the CPC recently sent a telegram congratulating the Sixth National Labor Congress being held in Harbin, stating:

    You are holding the Sixth National Labor Congress in your city of Harbin, which is the result of decades of heroic struggle by the Chinese working class; this shows the strong solidarity of the Chinese working class; this shows that the Chinese working class can only achieve revolutionary victory through heroic struggle under the banner of Mao Zedong. We believe that this congress will surely promote the further development of industrial construction in the liberated areas, promote the further unity of worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, carry forward the revolutionary struggle tradition of the Chinese working class, exert the greater fighting power of the Chinese people, and fight for the complete defeat of Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the establishment of a New Democratic Republic. All comrades of the North China Party and the people of North China are overjoyed and encouraged to learn that the congress has opened grandly and is progressing victoriously. We will make our best efforts to "increase industrial and agricultural production by an inch," actively support the front, continue to lead the war to the Kuomintang area, and strive for national victory, and congratulate the success of the congress.
