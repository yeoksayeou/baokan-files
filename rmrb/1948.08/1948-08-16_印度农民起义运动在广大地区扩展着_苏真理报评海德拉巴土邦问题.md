    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS, Moscow, 6th: Pravda recently published an article commenting on the Hyderabad issue, writing that the Nehru government is insisting that Hyderabad join the Indian Federation, while the King of Hyderabad stubbornly refuses. Indian progressive newspapers explain that the King of Hyderabad's attitude "is mainly due to the support given by British ruling figures. These figures, loyal to the old British colonial government, are fueling the flames of hatred between Hyderabad and India, so that armed conflict between the two countries is imminent." Pravda pointed out that this is not the essence of the Hyderabad issue. In fact, British ruling figures are anxious about another issue, namely that Hyderabad, the largest native state in India, has become the site of a powerful peasant movement. Since the partition of India, none of the major issues of concern to the people of India and Pakistan, such as industrial development and its nationalization, the liquidation of large landlord estates, the solution of national issues, and the political differences between the two autonomous regions, have been resolved. All of this naturally aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the people. Workers demanded relief from the hardships of the working people, and starving peasants demanded the liquidation of large landlord estates. The anti-King of Hyderabad and anti-landlord peasant uprising movement has spread to areas adjacent to Hyderabad and to several provinces and native states in northern and central India. The workers' movement is also gradually rising in India.

　　印度农民起义运动在广大地区扩展着
    苏真理报评海德拉巴土邦问题
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：真理报顷著文评论海德拉巴问题时写道，尼赫鲁政府正坚持要海德拉巴参加印度联邦，而海德拉巴王却倔强地加以拒绝。印度进步报纸解释道，海德拉巴王的态度，“主要是由于英国统治人物所给予的支持。这些忠于英国旧殖民政府的人物，正在煽动海德拉巴与印度之间的仇恨火焰，以致这两国间的武装冲突有一触即发之势”。真理报指出，这还不是海德拉巴问题的本质。实际上，英国统治人物正在另一问题上感到焦虑，即印度的最大土帮——海德拉巴已成为强大的农民运动的场所。印度分治以后，印度和巴基斯坦两国人民所关怀的主要问题，诸如工业发展及其国有化、大地主庄园的清算、民族问题的解决、及两自治领彼此间政治意见之分歧等问题，没有一个得到解决。所有这一切，自然要激起广大人民的不满，工人要求减轻劳苦人民的困难情况，穷得挨饿的农民要求清算大地主的庄园。反海德拉巴王、反地主的农民起义运动，已经扩展到邻近海德拉巴的地区以及印度北部、中部的若干省及土邦中。工人阶级的运动也在印度逐渐高涨。
