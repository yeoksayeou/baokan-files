　　Political Work and Management Education Experience of Civilian Laborers
    The civilian laborers of the 11th Sub-district of Central Hebei followed the army on a five-month expedition and successfully completed their support mission. The reason for achieving such excellent results is mainly due to the good political work and management education. The specific experiences are introduced below for reference.
    (1) The cadres leading the civilian laborers should set an example and share the hardships with the civilian laborers. During the XuShui battle, the cadres personally went to the front to carry stretchers and rescue the wounded on the front line, and some timid civilian laborers also became active. In the two-hundred-mile march, the commander of the 5th stretcher company of Wuqiang County carried quilts, backpacks, and stretchers for the civilian laborers all the way, which moved the civilian laborers so much that they did not complain even when they were tired. Lei Feiwu and two other militiamen from Jin County, after a half-day and one-night march, voluntarily accepted the communication task of traveling 180 miles back and forth. They only slept for one night in three days and three nights. After a short rest, they immediately embarked on a march of more than 300 miles. Although they were so tired that they could barely lift their feet, they did not complain.
    (2) The leadership style should be pragmatic, and rewards and punishments should be clear. After the Chahar campaign, some civilian laborers from the 2nd company deserted. The leaders criticized the entire 2nd company in front of the brigade without detailed research, which affected the morale of the civilian laborers. Some said: "Deserting is a disgrace. Are those of us who didn't desert also a disgrace? Why are we also being criticized?" After the leaders realized this, they immediately apologized and praised the good civilian laborers. The morale of the civilian laborers stabilized. No one deserted from the entire company until the end of the campaign.
    (3) Make the economy public, democratically manage food, and improve the lives of civilian laborers. At the beginning, the living was decentralized by platoon, and accounts were not made public for a long time. Some supply personnel engaged in corruption and waste. Because the civilian laborers did not understand the accounts, they suspected that the management personnel were corrupt when they saw them spending money, and they did not say good things even when their lives were improved. Later, a meeting was held to review and improve management, implement economic disclosure, expand the scope of food, eat in units of company, and administrative cadres and supply personnel closely combined to manage together, preventing corruption and waste, eliminating suspicion between civilian laborers and supply personnel, and improving lives.
    (4) Launch a meritorious service campaign. Improve the leadership style of cadres and improve the enthusiasm of civilian laborers. At the beginning, the leadership did not pay enough attention to meritorious service, the criteria for meritorious service were not clear, the conditions for meritorious service were too high or too low, the cadres took over the awarding, and logistical personnel and cadres were not included in the evaluation, resulting in low morale among both cadres and civilian laborers. Some said: "What's the glory of meritorious service!" The cadres were lax in their thinking, and the discipline of the civilian laborers was not very good. After the launch of the meritorious service campaign, the leadership clarified the idea of field operations and proposed "Wherever the troops fight, we will follow." Conscientiously implement the unified system of roll call, class, and asking for leave, making everyone's life tense, and the civilian laborers began to feel interested in collective life. Each company launched a meritorious service competition. Each brigade made a mobile model banner, which was evaluated once a week and given to the company that was the model. At the end of the mission, a summary was made. Each company sent representatives to other companies to inspect. As a result, both civilian laborers and cadres became active. In the past, it took an hour for a company to assemble, but now it only takes five or six minutes.
    (5) Launch a democratic movement. The instructor of the 2nd company of Ningjin civilian laborers used to beat and scold civilian laborers, and the company headquarters took care of everything, so the civilian laborers were not enthusiastic about their work. Later, a democratic movement was launched, and the civilian laborers openly criticized the leadership for not taking good care of the sick, the company headquarters should not take care of the food, and those who deserted or made mistakes should not be beaten and scolded, but should be educated and reformed, etc.; the leading cadres humbly accepted the opinions of the civilian laborers, made self-criticism at the conference, and were determined to transform the leadership. The morale of the civilian laborers gradually improved. In the past, some people played tricks and pretended to be sick, but now they are cured. The cadres began to care about the civilian laborers, and the company headquarters often prepared chicken and noodles for the sick, which the civilian laborers were very satisfied with.
    (6) Military cadres and local cadres closely combined to carry out the education of "soldiers love civilian laborers" and "civilian laborers love soldiers". Military leaders often gave reports to civilian laborers and mobilized soldiers to take care of civilian laborers. When housing, give priority to civilian laborers; when living in the same room, let civilian laborers sleep on the kang; when marching, military cadres carry things for civilian laborers, which is of great educational significance to civilian laborers. The leadership also timely put forward slogans to the civilian laborers to carry forward the hard work style, learn the regular system of field troops, and take care of the wounded and sick on the battlefield. Everyone consciously implemented it. Some civilian laborers said: "The soldiers' lives are much harder than ours. They are not afraid of sacrifice at the forefront of the battle. What are we afraid of? The soldiers care about us so much. If we don't take good care of the wounded, we will be too sorry for them."
    (7) Cadres go deep into the grassroots, discover changes in the thinking of civilian laborers and the sabotage of bad elements, and expose and educate them in a timely manner. For example, when civilian laborers first arrived in Chahar, they made several round trips on mountain roads to the plains for marching, and their lives were hard, so many civilian laborers were in turmoil. Serious desertion occurred in the Ningjin stretcher team. Later, the leaders went deep into the civilian laborers in a timely manner, and through the backbone, they made a breakthrough and found the saboteurs who organized the desertion, and dealt with and educated them, and the morale of the civilian laborers stabilized. In the past, the Jin County stretcher 3rd company, which had more serious desertion, had no desertion at all this time because the leadership grasped the rectification.

### 民工政治工作和管理教育经验

　　民工政治工作和管理教育经验
    冀中十一分区民工随军远征五个月，胜利完成支前任务。获得这种优异成绩的原因，主要是由于政治工作和管理教育作得好。现将其具体经验介绍如下，供各地参考。
    （一）带领民工的干部以身作则，和民工共甘苦。徐水战斗时，干部亲自到前方抬担架，火线抢救伤员，一些胆小的民工也随着积极起来。在二百里路的急行军中，武强担架第五连连长一路给民工背被子、背包袱、扛担架，感动得民工累了也不说累。晋县民兵雷费物等三人经过半天一夜的行军，又自动接受了往返一百八十里的通信任务，三天三夜只睡了一宿觉。回来后略休息了一下，紧接着就是三百余里的急行军。虽然累得抬不起脚来，也不说累。
    （二）领导作风实事求是，奖惩严明。察南战役结束后，二连民工发生逃亡，领导上没有详细研究，就将二连全体民工在大队面前进行了批评，结果影响了民工的情绪。有的说：“开小差是耻辱，我们这没开小差的也耻辱吗？为什么连我们也批评呢？”领导上发觉后，马上道歉，并对好的民工进行了表扬。民工情绪才稳定下来。全连到战役结束时无一逃亡。
    （三）经济公开，民主管理伙食，改善民工生活。开始是以排为单位分散生活，长期不公布帐目，部分供给人员发生贪污浪费现象。民工因不了解帐目，见管理人员花钱就怀疑是贪污，改善了生活也不说好。后来开会进行了检讨，改善了管理，实行了经济公开，扩大伙食范围，以连为单位吃饭，行政干部与供给人员密切结合，共同管理，防止了贪污浪费现象，消除了民工与供给人员之间的怀疑，改善了生活。
    （四）开展立功运动。改善干部领导作风，提高了民工的积极性。开始时领导上对立功不够重视，立功标准不够明确，立功条件订的过高过低不合适，干部包办加封，勤杂人员及干部不在评功之内，形成干部与民工情绪都不高。有的说：“功不功有什么光荣！”干部思想散漫，民工纪律也不大好。开展立功运动以后，领导上明确了野战化思想，提出“部队打到哪里，我们随到哪里。”认真执行了出操、上课和点名、请假、吃饭的统一制度，使大家生活紧张起来，民工们开始对集体生活感到兴趣。各连展开立功竞赛。每大队制了一面流动模范旗，一星期一评功，哪连模范给哪连，结束任务时总结。各连都派代表到别的连检查。这样一来，民工和干部都积极起来。过去一个连集合要一个钟头，以后五、六分钟就集合起来了。
    （五）开展民主运动。宁晋民工二连教导员以前打骂民工，连部包办一切，民工们工作情绪不高。后来开展民主运动，由民工们公开批评了领导上不好好照顾病号、连部不该包办伙食，对开小差、犯错误的不应打骂，应该教育改造等；领导干部虚心接收了民工的意见，在大会上进行了自我批评，决心改造领导，民工情绪逐渐好转。过去有些人调皮装病，这一来病也好了。干部对民工开始关心，连部常给病号准备着鸡子、挂面，民工们很满意。
    （六）部队干部与地方干部密切结合，开展“兵爱民工”、“民工爱兵”的教育。部队首长经常给民工作报告，并发动战士爱护民工。住房时先尽民工；在一个房里住时，让民工在炕上睡；行军时，部队干部给民工背东西，这对民工教育意义很大。领导上对民工也及时提出发扬艰苦作风，学习野战部队正规制度，在战场上爱护伤病员等口号。大家都自觉的去执行。有的民工说：“战士们比咱们的生活艰苦的多，打仗在最前线还不怕牺牲呢，我们还有什么可怕？战士对咱们这样关心，我们要不好好救护伤员，太对不起人家了。”
    （七）干部深入下层，发现民工思想变化及坏分子的破坏，及时揭露与教育。如民工初到察南时，从山路到平原往返数次急行军，生活又苦，不少民工情绪动荡。宁晋担架队发生严重逃亡现象，后来领导上及时深入到民工中，通过骨干，突破一点，找到了组织逃亡的破坏分子，进行了处理与教育，民工们情绪便稳定了。过去逃亡较严重的晋县担架第三连，因这次领导上抓紧整顿，始终无一逃亡。
