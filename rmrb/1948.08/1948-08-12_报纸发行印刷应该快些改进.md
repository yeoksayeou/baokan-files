　　Newspaper Distribution and Printing Should Be Improved More Quickly
　　Editor: The distribution of the People's Daily has been too slow recently. I hope you will pay attention to checking where the newspapers are being held up and what the reason is after you receive this letter. Sometimes three or four issues arrive at once. For example, once I received issues 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 all at once, but not issue 18. Later, issue 18 and issue 24 arrived together. Today I received issues 25, 26, 28, and 29, but not issue 27. What's the reason for this? I hope the responsible comrades will pay attention to ensuring that the newspaper is distributed in a timely manner, check why the newspapers are being held up, and please reply to this letter.
　　Liu Jing, Zhangqiu People's Postal Service

　　Editor: The People's Daily does not arrive regularly recently. Sometimes it doesn't come for three to five days, and sometimes two or three copies arrive at once. I feel this is not appropriate because newspapers are time-sensitive and are indispensable for guiding work and study. If they cannot reach readers in a timely manner like this, they cannot play their due role. Therefore, I suggest that the newspaper office and the post office have a good discussion to overcome difficulties so that the newspaper can reach readers in a timely manner.
　　Han Fulian, Headquarters of the JiluYu Military Region

　　Editor: The printing of our newspapers is not as good as before. Especially on the first page of the June 25th issue, there were more than a dozen characters that were not printed, and some characters were printed too heavily and were not clear. It may be that these copies here were not printed well. Furthermore, some newspapers, because the paper was small, were not carefully aligned when printing, resulting in the text being printed off the edge of the page, and many characters were lost. Some newspapers had a corner missing from the original paper, but were not picked out when printing, resulting in incomplete content. In order to improve the printing of our newspaper in the future, I hope the above points will be noted in the future.
　　Du Chongwu, Taihang Huixian Post Office

　　Editor: Since the People's Daily was founded, some characters in the newspaper have not been printed clearly. For example, in the news "People of All Classes in Kaifeng Enthusiastically Support Our Army's Policies and Actively Assist Our Army in Maintaining Order" published on the second page of the July 3rd issue: the second character in the fourth line; the fourth and fifth characters in the ninth line; and there are unclear characters in the seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first lines. There are three or four unclear characters in the second and third lines. I hope that in the future, the printing will be as clear as possible.
　　Fan Xinwen, First District, Licheng

Comrades Liu Jing, Han Fulian, Du Chongwu, and Fan Xinwen:
　　Our newspaper is newly established, and the distribution and printing work is not perfect, resulting in the majority of readers not being able to receive the newspaper in a timely manner, or the printing being unclear, making it difficult for readers to identify. In addition to expressing our deep apologies to the readers here, our distribution department has cooperated with the post office and relevant departments to study and improve the distribution methods, so that readers can receive the newspaper on time and on schedule; at the same time, the factory and relevant departments will overcome difficulties to improve printing conditions and strive to ensure that the newspaper is clear, and the paper is complete. We hope to continue to provide materials for inspection and improvement.
　　——Editor

　　Editor: Since the People's Daily was founded, we have seen the twenty-seventh issue, but there have been several unclear places in the typesetting and printing, which has caused great difficulties in reading. Now I would like to raise two points:

　　1. In the article "Taihang Local Armed Forces and Militia Annihilate 10,000 Enemies in Half a Year" published on the front page of your newspaper on July 6th (issue 22), the numbers "one four nine eight for the first half of the year before July 1st" were not printed clearly on some newspapers and should not have been sent to readers. I am afraid it should be "one nine four eight for the first half of the year".

　　2. In the newspaper on July 10th (issue 26), the left side published the North Yue Women's Cadre Expansion Conference Inspecting Production Leadership. Only half of the title was printed, and it is not known where the content was printed. The newspaper masthead listed the cancellation of road passes in the consolidated area but was not printed completely. The names of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the JinJiLuYu Border Region, and the Chairman of the JinChaJi Border Region, etc., were not there at all. Many comrades said that the newspaper office was too careless, how could people read it? This greatly reduces the prestige of the Party newspaper and also causes great losses to the Party's propaganda work. I hope it will be checked and improved. Regarding the July 10th newspaper, we returned it to the post office and asked for another one. Is this correct? Please reply by letter.
　　Cheng Zisheng, Reader, Taihang Shouyang

Mr. Cheng Zisheng:
　　In the news "Taihang Local Armed Forces and Militia Annihilate 10,000 Enemies in Half a Year" on the first page of our newspaper on July 6th, one four nine eight was a mistake for one nine four eight. The newspaper with unclear printing on July 10th should not have been issued in the first place. In addition to the distribution department making a review, we will send a replacement copy immediately, but for the convenience of inspection, we hope that you will send the original newspaper back after receiving the replacement.
　　——Editor

### 报纸发行印刷应该快些改进

　　报纸发行印刷应该快些改进
    编辑同志：人民日报发行最近太不及时，希你们见信后要注意检查一下，看报纸积压在什么地方，是什么原因。来一次不是三期就是四期，例如有一次一下接到十九、二十、二十一、二十二、二十三五期，十八期却没接到。以后十八期和二十四期是一块接到的。我今天接到了二十五、六期及二十八、九期，就是没有二十七期，这是啥道理？希望负责同志要注意，使报纸发行及时，检查积压报纸是啥原因，并请答复为要。
  　张秋人民邮务所刘静
    编辑同志：人民日报最近来的不经常，有时三五天不来，有时一次来两三张，最近又有一个多星期没来。我感觉这样不合适，因报纸是有时间性的，是指导工作及学习不可缺少的东西，如果象这样不能及时到达读者手里，就不能起应有的作用。所以我建议报社和邮局要很好的商讨一下，克服困难，能使报纸及时的到达读者手里才好。
  　冀鲁豫军区司令部　韩扶连
    编辑同志：咱们的报纸在印刷上都不如以前好了，特别在六月二十五号第一版上，就有十几个字空的没有印上，另外有一些字，印的过重，也是看不清楚。也可能是我们这里这几份没印好。再者还有一些报纸，因纸小，印的时候也没注意放正，结果印的把版突出了报，不少的字丢在外边没有印上。有的报纸因原来纸就缺少一个角子，印时也未拣出，结果印出来内容不够。为了把咱们报今后印刷的更好，以上几点希今后注意是荷。
    太行辉县邮局杜崇武
    编辑同志：人民日报创刊以来，报上有个别字印的不够真，比如七月三日第二版登载“开封各阶层人民热烈拥护我军政策纷纷协助我军维持秩序”一消息：第四行第二个字；第九行第四、五两字；第十七、十九、二十一行各有看不清字。第二三两行有三四个字看不清楚。希今后尽量印的真些。
    读者黎城一区范新文刘静、韩扶连、杜崇武、范新文等同志：
    本报初创，发行与印刷工作都不健全，致使广大读者不能及时收到报纸，或者印刷不清使读者不易辨认。除在此向读者深表歉意外，我们已由发行部门协同邮局及有关部门研究改进发行办法，务使读者能按期按时收到报纸；同时由工厂及有关部门克服困难改善印刷条件，努力做到报纸字迹清楚，纸张完整。尚望继续提供材料，以便检查改进。  　
　　——编者
    编辑同志：人民日报创刊以来，我们已看到第二十七号了，但在排版及印刷上发生了几个不清楚的地方，致使阅读时候感到很大困难，现在提出两点：
    一、七月六号（二十二号）贵报第一版发表太行地武及民兵半年歼灭万人一稿，“七一前夕公布一四九八年前半年”数字有些报纸印刷不清，不该发给读者。恐怕是“一九四八年前半年”吧。
    二、七月十号（二十六号）报左边发表北岳妇女扩干会检查生产领导，标题只印的半个，内容不知印在那里。报头上登的是取消巩固区内路条没印完全，晋冀鲁豫主席副主席，晋察冀主任委员等名字根本没有，许多同志都说报社太不细心，怎叫人看？这对党报威信大有降低，对党的宣传工作上亦有很大损失，希加以检查求得改进。关于十号报纸我们退回邮局叫再换一张，是否对，请来信。
    太行寿阳读者程子升程子升先生：
    七月六号本报一版太行地武及民兵半年歼敌一万一新闻中，一四九八年系一九四八年之误。七月十号印刷不清的报纸就本来不应发出，发行部门除应做检讨外，即将补寄一份，但为便于检查，希收到补报后，将原报寄回。
