(Northern Yue Dispatch) Leading cadres from Yi, Man, Xu, Wan, and Tang counties in Western Hebei are vigorously organizing the masses to eradicate armyworms and have achieved preliminary results. Chen Xi, the head of Mancheng County, personally led an insect pest inspection team to various districts to inspect and help the masses eradicate the pests. In Xu Shui County, in addition to a small number of cadres remaining in the office to maintain daily operations, the remaining cadres have gone to the countryside to lead the masses in fighting armyworms. The county party committee also convened a mobilization meeting on August 11 for all training class students and remaining office personnel, calling on everyone to mobilize and help the villagers eradicate armyworms. Party member cadres should perform meritorious service for the people through active pest eradication efforts. During the meeting, the technical extension team of the Border Region Agricultural and Forestry Bureau introduced the life cycle of armyworms and methods of eradication. In Tang County's Sixth District, some villages have organized armyworm eradication committees, with subordinate organization and mobilization sections and inspection sections, to specifically organize leadership and supervise the masses in eradicating armyworms. Lingnan Village in Yi County has mobilized all men, women, young, and old in the village, with each person responsible for two rows of crops, gently tapping with sticks to make the armyworms fall down, and then immediately stepping on them to death. Each person can kill the pests on one mu of land per day. A representative is selected from every six households to be responsible for inspection and supervision. After four days of effort, 112 mu of millet severely affected by the pest has been saved. The entire population of Nan Shuiyu Village formed five major groups, led by cadres, to first focus on the land most severely affected by the pest, pushing armyworm carts (pest trapping tools), catching twenty-eight jin of pests a day. In Wan County's Third District, armyworms are particularly serious in Beixiayi Village and Donggou area, with sixty or more armyworms being knocked off just twelve or thirteen seedlings. Currently, the village cadres are leading the masses in an effort to eradicate them. Street meetings are held in the evening to mutually review and exchange experiences, and blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts are also used to disseminate information and commend models in a timely manner.

　　北岳五专区各县
  　大力扑灭黏虫
    【北岳电】冀西易、满、徐、完、唐等县县区领导干部，大力组织群众扑打黏虫已获初步成绩。满城县长陈希亲带害虫检查组到各区检查，帮助群众扑灭。徐水县级机关除留少数干部在机关坚持日常工作外，其余干部均下乡领导群众打黏虫。县委并于八月十一日召集训练班全体学员及机关留守人员动员大会，号召全体动员起来，帮助驻村群众扑灭黏虫。党员干部要以积极灭虫的行动为人民立功。会中并由边区农林局技术推广大队介绍黏虫的生活规律与扑灭方法。唐县六区有的村子组织了灭虫委员会，下设组织动员股、检查股，具体组织领导与督促群众灭虫。易县岭南村把全村男女老少都动员起来，每人管两个垄，用棒轻轻拍打，黏虫掉下，随即用脚踩死，每人每天可打一亩。每六户选一个代表，负责检查督促。经四天努力，一百一十二亩虫灾严重的谷子已得救。南水峪全村群众组成了五大组，由干部带领，哪块地虫灾严重就先突击哪块，用黏虫车子（捕虫工具）推，一天捕虫二十八斤。完县三区北下邑村，东沟一带黏虫特别严重，十二三棵苗就可打下六十多条。现该村干部正领导群众努力扑打。晚上开街头会，互相检讨和交换经验，黑板报和屋顶广播也及时传播进行情形，表扬模范。
