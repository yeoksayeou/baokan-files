　　Should Agricultural Tax Be Progressive After Land Reform?
　　Editor:
　　There is one thing I can't figure out. Many comrades at the cadre meeting argued about it collectively, but couldn't resolve it. Please answer it publicly in the newspaper, which will benefit many people.
　　The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party consolidation work in 1948 state: "Adjust or revise the standards for agricultural tax (public grain) burden. This standard must adhere to the principle of considering both public and private interests, that is, on the one hand, it is conducive to supporting the war; on the other hand, it enables farmers to have the interest in restoring and developing production, and is conducive to improving farmers' lives." There has been a lot of controversy over this burden principle. Some say it should be progressive, which is fair and in line with the spirit of considering both public and private interests and supporting the war. Others say that's not right. In the old and semi-old areas, the vast majority of poor and hired peasants have been liberated, feudalism has been eliminated, and land yields are largely average. Non-progressive taxation satisfies middle peasants and is also approved by poor and hired peasants. This is in line with the principle of stimulating production. This dispute has never been unified and resolved. On June 12th, the New China Daily published the Taihang Administrative Office's order and interim measures for agricultural income tax. The order stated: "All previous progressive burden methods and last year's draft agricultural tax are hereby abolished." It seems like it is no longer progressive, but then there is a scoring table for agricultural income tax, which stipulates that from one dou to five dou of grain per person, one li is charged per dou, and for more than ten shi and one dou of grain per person, two fen are charged per shi. If you calculate it, the accumulated amount is not too large, but in any case, it is still progressive! Therefore, disputes have arisen again. Some say that progressive taxation is still correct, otherwise the Taihang Administrative Office would implement this method. The other side still says: according to the current rural situation, it is better not to be progressive. Although the Taihang method cancels progressive taxation, from the perspective of its burden differences, it is still progressive. This is of course possible, but in such a volatile situation, non-progressive taxation can better stimulate production enthusiasm, facilitate the organization of mass production, and facilitate support for the war. Each holds their own opinion and argues endlessly. On June 18th, the People's Daily published the Joint Instructions on Wheat徵 [zhēng, levy] Work in the Jin-Zhong-BeiYue Area issued by the Border Government, whose central spirit is as the newspaper title says "Reward intensive cultivation, increase production without increasing burden." Article 2 clearly stipulates "Collect wheat according to mu, without any progression. In the spirit of rewarding intensive cultivation, do not base it on actual yield; instead, levy 18% of the normal yield of wheat fields." Article 4 also says "Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the wealthy from concealing their output, and the poor and hired from squeezing the burden onto the middle peasants to increase the burden on components above the middle peasants, so as to make the burden fair and reasonable." This seems to be very clear! But there is still controversy. One side says that Jin-Cha-Ji may have thorough land reform, and land yields have been averaged, so progressive taxation has been stopped. Our Taihang disparity is still large, and it cannot be implemented. The other side says that the Taihang land reform work is okay, and the countryside has been largely averaged. We are not absolute egalitarianists, so why should we artificially and forcibly pursue absolute equality! In short, the dispute continues, becoming more and more confused, and unable to figure it out. Please take the trouble to answer it in the newspaper.

Li Wu, comrade:
　　Whether to implement a progressive tax system is indeed a major issue. To study this issue clearly, it is first necessary to clarify the difference in land distribution among various classes after land reform, and who will be subject to progressive taxation after land reform.
　　In the past period of the War of Resistance Against Japan and rent reduction and interest rate reduction, feudal forces still existed in the liberated areas, and peasants had not yet been liberated. At that time, the implementation of a relatively rapid progressive tax system, the purpose of which was to weaken feudalism in order to facilitate the development of production, played a positive role. In today's North China Liberated Area, the situation has completely changed. That is, land reform has been basically completed, feudalism has been basically eliminated, and poor and hired peasants have generally obtained land equivalent to the average. Although some households occupy a larger amount of output, the number is very small, and the difference is not significant, and most of them are families with one or two members; although there are some incomplete situations in some villages, they will soon be adjusted and resolved. From the perspective of the overall rural class relations after land reform, middle peasants account for the absolute majority and have become the main productive force in rural areas. In this case, if a progressive tax system is continued, it will not only lose its original positive significance, but will also burden the middle peasants, which is detrimental to production. Therefore, we advocate abolishing the progressive tax system and changing to a proportional tax system with an exemption point, which is of great benefit to encouraging farmers to become rich and actively produce.
　　However, in order to avoid the side effects of retaining the exemption point, which may cause small households to suffer losses, we advocate appropriately increasing the exemption point (deducting one and a half) for those who have no labor force and have difficulty in production, in order to provide considerable compensation.
　　The above are the opinions proposed by us and Comrades Li Chengrui and Huang Zichun of the Border Government Finance Department after jointly studying the questions raised in your letter. We hope that you will provide more specific materials so that we can continue to discuss and make suggestions to the government.

### 土改后农业税应否累进？

专栏：询问与答复

　　土改后农业税应否累进？
    编辑同志：
    我有一件事，弄不清，在干部会上很多同志集体扯，也扯不清，请能在报纸上公开答复，这对很多人都是有好处的。
    中共中央一九四八年土地改革工作和整党工作的指示里说：“调整或改订农业税（公粮）负担的标准。这种标准，必须遵守公私兼顾的原则，这即是一方面利于支援战争；一方面使农民有恢复发展生产的兴趣，利于改善农民生活”。对这一负担原则，发生很大争论，有的说应累进，那才公平，那才合于公私兼顾与支援战争的精神，有的说，那不对，目前老区半老区，贫雇绝大多数已翻身，封建已消灭，土地产量已大体平均，不累进中农满意，贫雇也赞成，这才合于刺激生产的原则，这个争执，始终没得到统一的认识与解决。到了六月十二号新华日报上登载了太行行署的命令和农业所得税暂行办法，命令上说：“所有以前实行之累进负担办法及去年之农业税草案着即废除”，看来好象不累进了，可是后边又有农业所得税征收分数表，其中规定从每人平均谷一斗到五斗每斗作一厘，到每人平均谷十石一斗以上，每石作二分，试算一下，累的数目不算太大，但无论如何，还是累啦！因此又发生了争论啦，有的说还是累进对，否则太行行署就会实行这个办法，另一方仍然说：根据目前农村情况以不累进为好，太行这个办法虽然是取消累进，但从它的负担等差看来，还是累进的，这样当然也可以，不过在这样动荡的情况下，以不累进更能刺激生产情绪，利于组织群众生产，利于支援战争。各执一是相争不下。六月十八日，人民日报上又登载了边府联合颁发的冀中北岳麦征工作指示，其中心精神正如报纸标题所说“奖励精耕细作，增产不增负担”其中第二条更明确规定“按亩征麦，一律不累进，一本奖励精耕细作精神，不按实际产量；而是根据麦田常年产量，征收其麦产百分之十八”。第四条又说“因此，必须预防富裕者隐瞒产量，及贫雇把负担挤到中农身上以加重中农以上成份负担的偏向，务使负担做到公平合理”。这样好象已经很明确啦！但仍有争论，一则说，那可能晋察冀土改彻底，土地产量已平均，所以停止累进，咱们太行悬殊仍大，不能实行。一则说，太行土改工作还可以，农村已大体平均，咱们又不是绝对平均主义者，为什么要人为的、强其绝对平均呢！总之，仍然是争执不下，越来越糊涂，弄不清个所以，请求费神在报上答复一下。
      立武立武同志：
    　所提应否实行累进税制，确是一个重大问题，要研究清楚这个问题，首须弄清土改后各阶层间土地分配的差额如何，和土改后仍累进时，被累进的将是什么人。
    在过去抗日战争与减租减息时期，解放区封建势力尚存在，农民尚未翻身，那时实行较快的累进税制，其目的，在于削弱封建，以利发展生产，曾起过积极的作用。在今天的华北解放区，情况已完全变了，这就是，土地改革已经基本完成，封建已基本消灭，贫雇农大体上已得到相当于平均数的土地，有些户虽占有较多产量，但为数很少，差额也不悬殊，且多系一、二口之家；某些村庄虽间有不彻底情形存在，但很快即会调剂解决。就土改后整个农村阶级关系看来，中农占绝对多数，并成为农村的主要生产力量。在此情况下，如再继续实行累进税制，不但已失去原有积极意义，而且会累到中农头上，加重中农负担，这对生产是不利的。因此，我们主张废除累进税制，改行有免征点的比例税制，这对鼓励农民发家致富积极生产有很大的好处的。
    但为了避免保留免征点也有使人少户吃亏的副作用，我们主张适当提高无劳力而生产困难者的免征点（扣除一个半），以予相当补救。
    以上是我们与边府财政厅李成瑞、黄子纯二同志对你来信所提问题共同研究后所提的意见，希望你提出更多具体材料咱们再继续讨论，以便向政府提出建议。
