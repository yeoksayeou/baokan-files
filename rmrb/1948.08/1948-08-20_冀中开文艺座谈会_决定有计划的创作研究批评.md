　　Jizhong Holds Literary and Art Symposium
　　Decides on Planned Creation, Research, and Criticism
　　[Jizhong News] The Propaganda Department of the Jizhong District Party Committee convened a symposium on literary and art work on July 15th to discuss issues such as literary and artistic creation and rural art activities. The meeting reviewed the current unorganized and unled state of literary and art work in Jizhong. After the land reform, the peasants urgently demanded culture and art. Village theater troupes and many folk artists needed performance materials, but they were not being supplied. The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee presented preliminary opinions on current literary and art work to the meeting. (1) Focus on restoring village theater troupes. Village theater troupes should be jointly led by the Party committees and education departments at all levels, and at the village level, by the village propaganda and education committees. (2) Advocate creation, currently focusing on short works, in order to promptly cooperate with current work. All creations should be organized for review and revision by certain cadres. (3) Various female art workers, village theater troupes, folk artists, etc., can establish literary and art groups from the bottom up, which will be guided by local Party committees and government propaganda and education departments, and maintain contact with the Literary Association. Finally, everyone proposed: In the future, we must organize everyone to create, research, and criticize in a planned manner.

　　冀中开文艺座谈会
  　决定有计划的创作研究批评
    【冀中讯】冀中区党委宣传部于七月十五日召开文艺工作座谈会，座谈文艺创作及乡艺活动等问题。会议检讨了冀中目前文艺工作上的无组织、无领导状态，土改后农民迫切要求文化艺术，乡村剧团和很多民间艺人需要演唱材料，但都供给不上。区党委宣传部向会议提出目前文艺工作的初步意见。（一）有重点的恢复村剧团，村剧团应由各级党委和政府教育部门共同领导，村级由村宣教委员会领导。（二）提倡创作，目前着重短小的作品，以便及时的配合当前工作。所有创作应组织一定干部审查、修改。（三）各种女艺工作者及村剧团、民间艺人等，可以自下而上的建立文艺小组，由各地党委及政府宣教部门加以指导，与文协取得联系。最后大家提出：今后要有计划的组织大家创作，研究及批评。
