Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th: The various organizations, schools, factories, and rural communities of Yan'an City have launched enthusiastic campaigns to support and comfort the army since July 19th. Workers in various factories in the Border Region have presented their own manufactured and saved daily necessities, along with personally written letters of support, to be carried to the front lines by representatives of the Border Region's慰问Delegation. Each factory has also resolved to increase production efficiency in order to reciprocate the frontline warriors. The Zhenxing Paper Mill's production has already doubled compared to the previous month, and the Chemical Factory's production quantity and quality have both improved and been enhanced. The female comrades of the Yan'an Prefectural Training Class for Cadres have sewn meticulous bowl covers, tobacco pouches, and comfort bags for the soldiers. On the snow-white comfort bags, inscriptions such as "People's Heroes," "Brave Enemies," or "Presented to the All-Victorious Heroes" are written in red ink. The directly subordinate units of the Joint Defense Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, Logistics Department, and Xingzhi Middle School first exhibited all the慰问gifts within their respective units, allowing everyone to observe and learn from each other. After visiting other people's慰问bags, cook Niu Songzhi felt that he didn't have enough items, so he hurriedly made another piece of pig pancreas (which could be used as soap) to add to it. Family members of the Liberation Army soldiers have entrusted Yang Buhao, a labor hero from Yan'an County participating in the frontline慰问Delegation, to carry messages and letters. Wu Shengwang's wife, a military dependent from Tianya Village in Chuankou District, ran over and said, "Old Yang, please take a message for me. Just say that the government has already delivered the new wheat to our home, and everyone has also cut firewood and brought it over. There are no difficulties at all, so tell him to fight the enemy with peace of mind." In addition to the enthusiastic mass campaign to comfort and support the army, Yan'an City has also held meetings to earnestly discuss the awareness of supporting the army, denounce the enemy's atrocities, and guarantee to do a good job in supporting the front. A group of young people who had just come from the Kuomintang-controlled areas wrote enthusiastically: "The people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas regard you as a symbol of happiness, and everyone is spiritually united around you. We are willing to be your reserves and eagerly await your rescue. We have been living in darkness, but now the light shines upon us. We are learning and will soon follow in your footsteps to shed blood and fight the enemy." After the women of the entire Li Jiaqu market in Yan'an County denounced Hu bandit's oppression and humiliation against them to the soldiers, they said affectionately: "The shoes you wear on your feet are made by us. You must avenge us! Now it's hot weather, drink more boiled water when marching, and don't rest in too shady places after sweating to avoid catching a cold. Take care of your health and kill more enemies."

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th: The frontline慰问Delegation composed of representatives from all walks of life in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan departed on the 14th to comfort the warriors who bravely annihilated Hu bandit in the Huanglong Southern Line. The delegation is led by Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan Joint Defense Army, Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, and Fang Wenli, a member of the Border Region参议会. The representatives from all walks of life participating include labor hero Yang Buhao, trade union representative Li Haiying, women's representative Gao Minzhen, chamber of commerce representative Zhang Shulin, and youth and student representatives, totaling fourteen people. The delegation is carrying over 4,000慰问 items such as慰劳品, letters of support, comfort bags, and banners. In addition, there are several New Democracy Medals from the Border Region Government, which will be awarded to special-class combat heroes and model cadres.
