　　Promoting the Whole Party in Running the Newspaper
　　Yuanchao County Launches "One Article Per Person" Campaign
    [Jinan Telegram] The Yuanchao County Committee initiated August as a "writing competition month," calling on all county organs and schools to launch a "one article per person" campaign. To ensure the success of the campaign, all units have gone through discussions to resolve ideological obstacles in writing. The discussion in the First District resulted in a consensus that writing articles helps oneself summarize work, provides superiors with an understanding of the situation, makes one's work style more thorough and meticulous, and strengthens analytical ability. Everyone's enthusiasm is very high. In the discussions in the Third District, comrades who had not written articles in the past conducted self-criticism, clarifying that actively writing articles is a responsibility that every comrade should bear to the Party newspaper. A writing challenge competition has now been launched throughout the county. On July 30, all comrades in the Public Security Bureau challenged the county government, followed by challenges between districts, between schools, and within various units. The conditions for the challenge mainly include: 1. Authentic material. It is necessary to go deep into reality to have a comprehensive understanding, not just listen to one-sided reports. 2. Write more about the specific activities and experiences of the masses. 3. Help worker-peasant comrades write articles. Collective research and collective writing are encouraged. 4. Leading cadres should personally take action, organize inspections, and promote the writing campaign in order to achieve the goal of the whole party running the newspaper.
