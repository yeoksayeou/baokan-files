　　【Taiyue Dispatch】The Taiyue Administrative Office allocated and issued 300 million yuan in loans for topdressing fertilizer and wheat seeds on July 24th. This year, the rainfall in the region has been relatively even, and the autumn seedlings are generally growing well. However, due to rough plowing and sowing in the spring, and insufficient application of manure, the effect of the fertilizer had diminished by the time of heading. In order to achieve increased production, the Administrative Office, in addition to calling on the masses to thoroughly weed three times, has specifically issued loans to organize and assist the masses in applying topdressing fertilizer, and to continue eliminating wasteland to expand the area sown with wheat. In the loan instructions, the Administrative Office requested that governments at all levels immediately seize the season, mobilize and organize the masses, and mobilize labor heroes, mutual aid team leaders, and all cadres to take the lead in applying fertilizer to autumn seedlings such as corn, cotton, and paddy rice with manure and other effective fertilizers. At the same time, actively mobilize the masses to pad pens and press green manure, and eliminate wasteland, plow the land, and exchange and purchase wheat seeds in preparation for expanding and planting wheat fields well. In terms of loan methods, it is necessary to have key points and centers (purpose, target, and region), with villages as units, to introduce organized loans to banks, and overcome the problem of lacking key points and centers, and distributing loans averagely from top to bottom to villages and households. Prevent detached from reality "hard lending" and the task viewpoint of "must lend all." This loan is scheduled to be repaid by the end of November, with a monthly interest rate of three percent.

　　帮助群众普上追肥准备麦种
  　太岳发放贷款三亿
    【太岳电】太岳行署七月二十四日拨发追肥肥料和麦种贷款三万万元。该区今年雨水比较调匀，秋苗一般长的不错。但因春地犁种粗糙，粪上的少，至秀穗时粪效已失。行署为达到增产目的，除号召群众贯彻锄三遍外，特发放贷款，组织、帮助群众上追肥，并继续消灭荒地，扩大种麦面积。行署在贷款指示中，要求各级政府立时抓紧季节，动员组织群众，发动英模、互助组长及全体干部带头，以茅粪及其他有效肥料，在玉茭、棉花和水地谷等秋苗上奶青。同时积极发动群众垫圈压绿肥，并灭荒犁地调换选购麦种，准备扩大与种好麦田。在贷款的方式上，必须有重点有中心（用途、对象和地区），以村为单位，有组织的介绍向银行贷款，克服没重点没中心，自上而下的平均分散到村户的毛病。防止脱离实际的“硬贷”与“必须贷完”的任务观点。此项贷款定十一月底归还，月息三分。
