　　[Taihang Electric] The vast newly recovered villages and towns of Taigu, under the rapid support of our democratic government, have largely settled down to production and support the front lines. Except for three districts in the bordering mountainous semi-old areas, four administrative districts have been formally established in the new district's plains. In areas where we annihilated the Yan bandit forces, such as Fancun, Shang'an, and especially Xiaochang Village, where the fighting was most intense, the democratic government is mobilizing the masses to clean up the battlefield and help repair the houses of the masses damaged by the war's artillery fire. The county hospital and the church's Renwei Hospital have formed eight medical teams to go to the war zone to treat the wounded masses. The masses, who had been almost completely looted by the Yan bandits, have rebuilt their homes and started to resume production after receiving comfort and relief from the government. In all the newly recovered towns and villages, the refugees have returned to their hometowns one after another, and the autumn seedlings have been weeded once, and they are rushing to plant late crops. In areas such as Huanggua, Fengshan, and Fancun, and in the guerrilla zones of Rencun, Shangzhuang, and Yangyi before liberation, one-third of the land was barren. The government has organized the masses to rush to plant a large amount of buckwheat and autumn vegetables, and called on the organization of women and children to reclaim wasteland in preparation for planting wheat. The government also announced that whoever plants and harvests the wheat on reclaimed wasteland will be exempt from all summer grain burdens next year. Dozens of hectares of farmland forcibly planted by the Yan pseudo-troops' organs and schools were also returned to the original owners for cultivation. More than 90 mu of vegetable gardens of the Yan bandit's Ninth Column in the suburbs were confiscated and distributed to poor farmers with little or no land for harvesting and cultivation. Although the masses who are currently in extreme poverty have been relieved, the number is still very large. The government has specially allocated a large amount of military wheat to organize flour milling in the urban area and various villages. For every 100 jin of wheat milled, 80 jin of flour is handed over, which is 16 jin less than the Yan bandit's regulation of forcing the masses to hand over 96 jin of flour for every 100 jin of wheat milled. The masses have benefited greatly, so they are competing to receive wheat and rush to grind it day and night. The masses in the new district, who have been devastated by the Yan bandits, are grateful for the liberation by our army and government, and say, "The common people have really seen the sunny days since the Liberation Army came." In their busy schedule, the masses are actively organizing support for the front lines. Every day, more than 200 large carts are rushing to transport military grain and supplies to the front lines, more than 150 stretchers are accompanying the army, and more than 1,000 civilian workers are transferring and caring for the wounded.
　　[Another News] The democratic government has separately resettled more than 600 households of people from the four villages around Taigu City who were coerced into the city by the Yan pseudo-regime and landlords who fled to the city after registration. The government issued a return certificate to the masses who voluntarily returned to their hometowns, and helped them with travel expenses if they were very difficult. The landlords who feared the masses' liquidation were also willing to return home after our government explained our party's land policy to them and expressed that they would engage in labor and production after returning to their hometowns. The government also issued them return certificates and wrote letters to their original government for resettlement. (Sai Xing)
　　[Chahar Electric] After the re-liberation of Laishui City, the democratic government immediately led the masses to vigorously launch a surprise attack to eliminate wasteland. Currently, 93% of the wasteland in the urban area has been eliminated, and the masses' production enthusiasm is extremely high. In 1946, the Chiang bandits occupied Laishui City, and the local masses were forced to build city walls and bunkers, and the labor burden was extremely heavy, and the peasants were unable to manage their own land. In 1947, the Chiang bandits ordered that no crops be planted within three li of the city walls and blockhouses, which further increased the amount of wasteland. This year, the enemy surrounded the city and dug two moats, each more than two zhang wide and deep. Only people were allowed to pass through the moat openings, and large carts were not allowed. The sun was high and far away and they were not allowed to leave the moat. The drawbridge was raised before it was dark, and the peasants' production was extremely difficult. Before liberation, there were 1,646 mu of wasteland in the urban area. After our army liberated the city, it immediately leveled the moat and mobilized the masses to rush to cultivate and hoe, and now 1,517 mu of wasteland have been eliminated.

　　在民主政府安抚扶助下
  　太谷新区恢复生产
    涞水政府领导新解放群众大力灭荒
    【太行电】太谷广大新收复村镇，经我民主政府迅速扶助恢复，大部群众已在安心进行生产支援前线。全县除边山原半老区三个区外，新区平川已正式建立四个行政区，在我歼灭阎匪之范村、上安特别是激战最烈的小常村等地，民主政府正动员群众打扫战场，帮助修补战争炮火损害之群众房屋。县医院及教会之仁卫医院，并组成八个医生之医疗队赴战争地区为受伤群众进行治疗。曾经被阎匪抢劫殆尽之群众获得政府安扶救济后，已重建家园开始恢复生产。所有新收复乡镇，逃难群众纷纷返乡，秋苗已普遍锄了一遍，正赶种晚作物。黄卦、凤山、范村等地与解放前之游击区任村、上庄、阳邑等村中间三分之一土地荒芜，政府已组织群众赶种大量荞麦秋菜，并号召组织妇女儿童翻荒准备种麦。政府并宣布翻荒播种之小麦谁种谁收，明年夏粮负担一概豁免。原阎伪部队各机关学校强种之民田数十顷亦退还原主耕种，城郊阎匪九纵队之九十余亩菜园，没收后分给无地少地之贫苦农民进行收耕。目前生活极端困难之群众虽经救济为数仍很多，政府特将大批军麦分配城关及各村组织磨面。每磨百斤小麦交面八十斤，较阎匪在时强迫群众磨面百斤交面九十六斤之规定即少交十六斤，群众获利颇丰，故群众相争领麦日夜赶磨。受阎匪摧残之新区群众感激我军及政府之解救，都说：“解放军来后老百姓真是见了晴天。”群众在百忙中积极组织支援前线，仅每天向前线赶运军粮军需供应之大车即达二百余辆，随军担架一百五十余副，转送及看护伤员的民工达一千余人。
    【又讯】太谷城内为阎伪胁迫入城之四乡群众及逃亡城内之地主六百余户经登记后，我民主政府已分别予以安置。自愿返乡之群众，均由政府发给归籍证，十分困难的并帮助其路费。畏惧群众清算之地主经我政府向其讲解我党之土地政策后亦愿返家，并表示回籍后要劳动生产，政府同样发给归籍证并写信交给其原籍政府予以安置。　　　（塞行）
    【察哈尔电】涞水城重获解放后，民主政府立即领导群众大力突击灭荒，现城关荒地已消灭百分之九十三，群众生产情绪极高。一九四六年蒋匪侵占涞水城，当地群众被迫修城筑堡，劳役负担极其繁重，农民无力经营自己的土地。一九四七年蒋匪下令城垣及炮楼三里以内，一律不准种庄稼，更增加了良田荒芜的数量，今年敌人又围城挖掘两道护城沟，宽深各二丈多，沟口只许过人不许过大车，太阳大高远不叫出沟，天还不黑就收起吊桥，农民生产困难重重。至解放前，城区共荒地一千六百四十六亩。我军解放该城后，马上平毁护城沟，并动员群众抢耕抢锄，现已消灭荒地一千五百十七亩。
