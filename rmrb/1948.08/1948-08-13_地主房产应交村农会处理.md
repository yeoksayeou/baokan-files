　　Inquiry and Answer

　　Landlord's Property Should Be Handled by the Village Farmers' Association
　　In Houwang Village, Ninth District of En County, there is a landlord named Wang Zigong whose residence has three courtyards, each with eleven or twelve rooms, totaling thirty-six rooms. Nine years ago, before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, it had been occupied by the puppet army and became a small stronghold. After liberation, the landlord returned to live there, and now an elementary school (named Seventh Elementary School) has been established in this residence. Is this residence public property? Should the school be permanently established there? Or should it be returned to the villagers?
　　From Wang Huaide and Liu Jinxiao, students of the Seventh Elementary School, Houwang Village, Ninth District, En County, Jinnan.
　　△Answer: The landlord's property should be confiscated by the village farmers' association and distributed to the villagers. If the villagers agree to give the house to the school, then the school can naturally be permanently established there. Otherwise, the house should be returned to the village farmers' association for distribution to the villagers. If the school has difficulty moving, it can negotiate with the farmers' association to temporarily borrow it while finding a new school site.

　　地主房产应交村农会处理
    恩县九区侯王庄大地主王子公的宅子，有三个院，每院十一二间房，共三十六间。在前九年，解放军没来的时候，已经被皇协军占领了，成了一个小据点。解放以后，这个地主又在这里居住，而现在已经在这个宅子上成立了完小（名是七完小）。这个宅子是不是公宅，该不该永久成立学校？还是该再归还本村农民？
    冀南恩县九区侯王庄七完小学生王怀德、刘进孝同启
    △答：地主的房产，应由该村农会没收分配给本村农民，若该村农民同意将房子给学校的话，自然可以永久成立学校。否则即应将房子交回该村农会分配给农民，学校如有困难不能迁走，可商得农会同意暂时借用的一面另找新校址。
