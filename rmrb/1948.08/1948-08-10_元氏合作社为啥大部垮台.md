Why Did Most Yuanshi Cooperatives Collapse?

Of the village cooperatives in Yuanshi County, there were 96 in December 1947. By the end of June this year, 25 had collapsed, 45 were semi-collapsed (basically shut down), and 26 were maintaining their current status and continuing to operate. In December of last year, the village cooperatives operated 141 workshops of various kinds; by June of this year, 67 had collapsed. Last December, the cooperatives supported 180 small-scale cooperatives; it is now estimated that no more than 50 remain. Of the original 25 transportation teams, all have now gone their separate ways. The cooperatives originally had 10 credit departments with a total capital of over 5.8 million yuan, but these have collapsed because loans could not be repaid on time.

I. Losses to the Masses

The statistical data from two villages is sufficient to illustrate the serious losses to the masses caused by the collapse of the village cooperatives. The Shiban Gou Cooperative in the Second District was one of the better ones in the district and was supported by the masses. The village had 143 households, with 128 households participating in the cooperative, a total of 281 members, and a capital of 3.2 million yuan. It had a flower house, two oil presses, a local dyeing house, and a lumber mill. The cooperative sold cotton to the masses at 300 to 400 yuan per jin lower than the market price, dyed cloth at 50 yuan per chi lower than the market price, and sold 13,000 jin of oil cakes (for fertilizer) to the village at 3,000 yuan per 100 jin lower than the market price. According to six months of statistics (from September of last year to February of this year), the net profit was 3.08 million yuan. The cooperative organized seven small agricultural and sideline cooperatives with 80 members, raising a capital of more than 790,000 yuan. In conjunction with the autumn plowing, they engaged in oil pressing, oil exchange, tofu making, flour milling, transportation, and firewood gathering. In six months, the net profit was more than 1.4 million yuan. The large and small cooperatives earned a total of more than 4.5 million yuan in six months, equivalent to more than 325 shi of grain. However, this cooperative collapsed due to serious errors in leadership. The Xichu Village in the Fourth District had 133 households with 577 people and 3,050 mu of land. During the famine last year, the village cooperative led the masses to organize 12 mutual aid teams and four small-scale cooperatives. In addition to completing agricultural production, they engaged in sideline occupations with surplus labor, earning 1.81 million yuan. The cooperative had a credit department that lent out more than 830,000 yuan to support the masses in agricultural and sideline production. Under the organization and leadership of the cooperative, the entire village earned 470,000 yuan every five days through sideline production alone. However, this cooperative also collapsed due to errors in leadership, and the masses' production completely fell into disarray.

II. Reasons for the Collapse of Village Cooperatives

(1) The county and district leadership promoted a one-sided poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoint, emphasizing the so-called "poor peasant and hired laborer line." Starting with the Three Check-ups and Study Movement last year, the leadership launched a movement to squeeze out "feudalism" in the cooperatives (actually squeezing out production), removing many cadres and technicians from the cooperatives who were the targets of struggle, and also squeezing out many middle peasants. At that time, they emphasized "poor peasants and hired laborers being masters of their own house," and replaced them with poor peasant and hired laborer cooperative chairmen and accountants. This was a strong evil trend at the time. Although the Central Bureau and District Party Committee constantly pointed out: allowing landlords and rich peasants to participate in various labors after the land reform cannot be called feudalism, labor is anti-feudalism, squeezing out feudalism only means squeezing out landlords and rich peasants who evade the land law outline and escape, not landlords and rich peasant elements who participate in production after the land reform. Regarding cooperatives, it was also pointed out that cooperatives are production organs, and everything should aim at developing production and increasing wealth, and should not also rely on poor peasants and hired laborers. But these educational instructions had no effect. At that time, there seemed to be a "leftist" force that could not be stopped. The middle peasant chairmen of the Xianwengzhai, Beisu Village, and Geziling cooperatives were all squeezed out. These three were all capable, experienced, and enthusiastic about serving the cooperatives. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, many poor peasant groups demanded to use the things of the cooperatives. The Nanzheng and Wang Village cooperatives confiscated the shares of the households that were struggled against, and the Xijia Village sent poor peasants to the cooperative to supervise. As a result, many capable and experienced old cadres were squeezed out, and many of those who remained simply lay down and did nothing. The newly appointed poor peasant cadres had no experience in cooperative management and could not operate. The poor peasant chairman of Xianwengzhai Cooperative, who was just replaced, could not lead the management. The poor peasant accountant of the Kuang Village Cooperative simply could not do the accounts. The drugstore of the Beisu Village Cooperative was replaced with a poor peasant shopkeeper, who made mistakes in dispensing medicine, and the masses were afraid to buy medicine when they were sick. In some cooperatives, funds were used casually. Many middle peasants were very afraid, pretended that they could not maintain their lives, and withdrew their shares from the cooperative.

(2) Since the reorganization, county and district cadres have been busy with land reform and production and disaster relief in the new districts and are not good at allocating time, so they have relaxed their leadership over the cooperatives. Some did not ask about the situation of the cooperatives, and some, even if they did manage it a little, only mobilized the poor peasant groups to make suggestions to the cooperatives and ask for some relief materials, without paying attention to rectification and transformation. In terms of cadre treatment, many village cooperative cadres worked for free, only mistakenly emphasizing "serving the masses," and mistakenly not taking care of their families and production difficulties. Many cooperative cadres neglected their own land and missed their own production, causing family discord and wives' complaints. The chairman of the Nanwu Society was a poor peasant whose family did not even have rice to eat. The vice chairman of Qifan Village Cooperative used his own livestock to work for the village cooperative, and his father wanted to separate from him. This made many cadres unwilling to work, unmotivated, and unenthusiastic. The cadres of the county cooperative also abandoned systematic work and had no guidance on the management and business direction of the village cooperatives. The board of directors and the board of supervisors were never held, and the difficulties could not be solved, so they had to stop.

(3) The cooperatives had too much external debt, which affected their operation. The middle peasant cadres in the cooperative were afraid of offending people and did not dare to collect debts, and the poor peasant cadres believed that collecting debts would harm the interests of the poor peasants and hired laborers. Many members were afraid that struggling against the cooperative would cause them to lose their shares, so they adopted the method of grabbing a handful from the cooperative, taking goods without paying (that is, secretly withdrawing shares). Too much external debt affected the operation. According to the statistics of 65 village cooperatives, the original capital was more than 37 million yuan, and external debt accounted for 50% of the total capital. In addition to the funds occupied by furniture, tools, and slow-moving goods, the working capital accounted for only 25% of the total capital. The most serious case was the Xichu Village Cooperative, which originally had a capital of 1.08 million yuan, and external debt reached 950,000 yuan. The Yangjiazhai Cooperative originally had a capital of 1.8 million yuan, and external debt reached 1.3 million yuan.

III. How to Rectify?

In order to continue to run the cooperatives, we should immediately correct policies, rectify deviations, solve the cadre problem, recover external debts, rectify funds, clarify the business direction, and continue to expand operations. (1) Adjust cadres, improve treatment. For those capable and experienced cadres and technicians who were mistakenly squeezed out in the past, we should apologize to them, invite them back, and restore their work. All monitoring personnel sent to the society by the poor peasant groups and new peasant associations should be revoked after persuasion. The newly appointed poor peasant cadres who are capable and good should continue to be retained, and those who cannot do the job should be persuaded to leave the village cooperative post. In terms of cadre treatment, we must resolutely correct the deviation of allowing cadres to use their own livestock and labor and eat their own food to "serve the masses." The number of people who are separated from production should be determined and appropriate treatment should be prescribed according to the size of the village cooperative, the amount of capital. Grasp the principle of taking both public and private into account. For worker treatment, it is best to adopt the principle of profit sharing, which guarantees higher wages than ordinary mutual aid groups. Workers with handicraft tools and skills should be paid even higher, and a bonus system can be adopted. Industrial tools should be priced as shares. (2) Recover external debts and rectify funds. Clarify that the cooperative is an economic organization that supports and promotes mass production, not a charitable organization. No matter who owes external debts, they should be paid off quickly. For the poor, they should be organized to produce and repay. Village cadres should pay off their debts first to influence others. Funds withdrawn from the cooperative in the name of the poor peasant group for relief or for organizing small poor peasant cooperatives should be returned unconditionally. Credit loans should be repaid in full with principal and interest, and those in need should be lent separately. In the future, the cooperative's sales should stipulate that there should be no credit in principle, and in special circumstances, it should be guaranteed that money will be paid on time. Those who invest fruit funds in the cooperative should not withdraw them immediately before the draw-up and adjustment, but should withdraw them when the draw-up and adjustment are made for distribution, or continue to use them as shares after distribution. All shares of landlords, rich peasants, and wrongly struggled middle peasants that were confiscated in the past should be unconditionally returned. In order to more effectively support mass production, each village cooperative can carry out closing accounts and sharing profits, and expand a part of the funds by encouraging the masses to discuss and freely invest in shares. (3) Clarify the business direction and continue to expand operations: According to the experience of the cooperatives in recent years, the business policy of the village cooperative should mainly be to support and organize mass production according to the seasons, grasp the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, and support and develop small-scale cooperatives rather than annexing them. For the current state of collapse and stagnation, we should correct deviations in a planned and step-by-step manner and try to restore or rebuild. (Wang Bingzhang)

Editor's Note: The collapse of cooperatives is not only the case in Yuanshi County, but may be more common in Taihang. The Taihang District Party Committee and Administrative Office should conduct a comprehensive inspection of this issue and quickly rectify it; if it is delayed any further, it will greatly hinder mass production.

    元氏合作社为啥大部垮台
    元氏各村的村合作社，在一九四七年十二月共有九十六个，到今年六月底垮台二十五个，半垮台（基本上已停业）四十五个，维持现状继续经营的二十六个。去年十二月各村社经营各种作坊一百四十一座，到今年六月垮台六十七座。去年十二月合作社扶植的小型社有一百八十个，现在估计所余不过五十个。运输队原二十五个，现全部自流了。社内附设的信用部原有十个，资金共五百八十余万元，已因贷出之款不能按期收回而垮台了。
    一、对群众的损失
    两个村的统计材料，已够说明村社垮台对群众的损失是很严重的。二区石板沟合作社是二区较好的一个，为群众所拥护。全村一百四十三户，入股者一二八户，社员二八一人，资金三二○万元。内设花房一个，油房二个，土染房一个，木厂一个。该社卖给群众的棉花每斤低于市价三百元到四百元，染布一尺低于市价五十元，卖到本村油饼一万三千斤（作肥料），每百斤低于市价三千元。据六个月统计（去年九月到今年二月）净赚纯利三○八万元。该社组织群众结成农副业小型社七个，有八十个社员，集股七十九万余元，结合秋耕，进行打油、换油、作豆腐、磨面、运输、打柴。六个月净赚一百四十余万元。大社小社六个月共赚四百五十余万元，折合谷子三百二十五石余。但是，这个社由于领导上发生了严重的错误而垮台了。四区西褚村一百三十三户，五百七十七人，有土地三千零五十亩。去年渡荒时，村合作社领导群众组织十二个互助组，四个小型社，除完成农业生产外，以节余劳力搞副业，赚洋一百八十一万元。社内设信用部，贷出款八十三万余元，扶助群众进行农业副业生产。在合作社的组织领导下，全村只副业生产，每五天能赚四十七万元。但是，这个合作社也因为领导上发生错误而垮了台，群众生产完全陷于自流。
    二、村社垮台的原因
    （一）县区领导上提倡片面贫雇观点，强调所谓贫雇路线。去年由三查学习开始，领导合作社来了个挤“封建”运动（实际即挤垮生产运动），把不少合作社中被斗户的干部及技术工人挤了出去，不少中农也被挤出。当时强调“贫雇当家作主”，换上了贫雇社长，贫雇会计。这在当时是一股有劲的歪风，当时中央局区党委虽然不断的指出：允许地富在土改后参加各种劳动，这不能叫做封建，劳动就是反封建，挤封建只是挤不执行土地法大纲而逃避的地富，不是土改以后参加生产的地富分子。关于合作社也指出，合作社是生产机关，一切以发展生产增加财富为目标，而不应也来个依靠贫雇。但这些教育指示，毫不起作用，当时似乎有股“左”劲挡不住。仙翁寨、北苏村、割子岭三个社的中农社长都挤掉了，他们三个却都是有能力有经验并热心为合作社服务的人。在土地法大纲公布后，不少贫雇团要求动用合作社东西。南正、王村都没收了被斗户股金，西贾村派贫雇到合作社监视。结果，不少有能力有经验的旧干部被挤出去，留下的有不少躺倒不干了。新上台的贫雇干部对合作社经营没经验，干不开。仙翁寨才换的贫雇社长不会领导经营，旷村合作社贫雇会计根本不会算帐，北苏村合作社药铺换上贫雇掌柜，把药都给抓错了，群众有病不敢去买药。有的合作社款项被随便动用，不少中农很害怕，假装没法维持生活，抽出了合作社股金。
    （二）整编以来，县区干部忙于土改及新区的生产渡荒，而不善于分配时间，以致放松对合作社的领导。有的对合作社情况不闻不问，有的即使管一下，也是动员贫农小组向合作社提提意见，索取一些救济资料，而不注意整顿改造。在干部待遇上，有不少是村社干部白尽义务，只是错误地强调“为群众服务”，错误地不照顾其家庭和生产上的困难。不少合作社干部荒了自己的土地，误了自己的生产，引起家庭不和妻子瞒怨。南吴会社长是个贫农，家里连吃的米都没有。齐范村副社长，用自己的牲口给村社干活，他父亲要和他分家。弄得不少干部不愿干，工作不主动，不积极。县社干部也放弃了系统工作，对村社的经营管理和业务方向根本没有指导。理事会，监事会，更无人负责召开，困难无法解决，只好停顿。
    （三）合作社外欠太大，影响了经营。社内中农干部怕得罪人不敢要帐，贫雇干部认为要了帐怕损伤贫雇利益。不少社员怕斗争了合作社赔了自己的股金，就到合作社采取抓一把的办法，取货不给钱（亦即暗抽股）。外欠太大，影响了经营。据六十五个村社统计，原共资金三千七百余万元，外欠即占总资金的百分之五十。再除了家具工具及冷货占有的资金，使流动资金只占总数的百分之二十五，最严重的西褚村社原资金一百零八万，外欠达九十五万元。杨家寨原资金一百八十万元，外欠达一百三十万元。
    三、如何整顿？
    为了把合作社继续搞起来，应即进行端正政策，纠正偏向，解决干部问题，收回外欠，整顿资金，明确业务方向，继续扩大经营。（一）调整干部，改善待遇，对过去错误挤出去的有能力、有经验的干部和技术人员，应向他们赔个不是，请回来恢复工作。凡由贫雇团新农会派到社内的监视人员，一律经过说服撤销。新任的贫雇干部能干的、好的继续留任，个别干不了的应说服其脱离村社职务。在干部待遇上，坚决纠正让干部用自己牲口、劳力，吃上自己的饭而为“群众服务”的偏向，应根据村社经营大小，资金多少，来确定脱离生产人数和规定适当待遇。掌握公私兼顾原则，对工人待遇，最好采取分红的两利原则，保证高于一般互助组工资。带有手工业工具和技术的工人，应比一般工人更高一些，可采取提奖办法，工业工具要作价顶股。（二）收回外欠整顿资金，明确合作社是扶植推动群众生产的经济组织，而不是慈善机关，不论任何个人外欠都应迅速还清。对贫苦者，应组织其生产归还。村干欠款应首先还清，以影响他人。以贫雇团名义从合作社内抽出作为救济之用的资金，或用以组织贫雇小社者，应无条件交回。信用贷款，一律本利交回，需用者另贷。今后合作社卖货应规定原则上不赊帐，特殊情况要保证定期交钱。果实款投入合作社者，在未进行抽补调剂时当下不抽，俟抽补调剂时抽出分配，或分配后继续作股。凡过去没收地富及错斗中农股金，应一律无条件退还。各村社为了更有力的扶植群众生产，可进行结帐分红，通过群众讨论自由入股，扩大一部资金。（三）明确业务方向，继续扩大经营：根据合作社几年来的经验，村社的业务方针主要应该是根据季节扶植和组织群众生产，掌握劳资两利原则，对小型社是扶植发展而不是吞并。对当前垮台、停顿的状态，有计划地有步骤地纠正偏向，设法恢复或重建。（王秉章）          
    编者按：合作社垮台不仅元氏一县如此，在太行可能较普遍。对此问题，太行区党委与行署应作全面检查，迅速整顿；如再延缓，对群众生产的妨害是很大的。
