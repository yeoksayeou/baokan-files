Xinhua News Agency, North China, 22nd: According to a Hebei dispatch published in the Shanghai Observer Weekly on July 31st, the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Hebei province are suffering under heavy burdens in villages and towns, industry and commerce are in decline, and the people's lives are miserable. In eastern Hebei, the requisition in Fengrun County amounts to 72 catties per mu of land. Luan County has been frequently struck by earthquakes since 1946, but the destruction caused by the Kuomintang's exploitation is even more thorough. The enemy troops have searched every house, from the roof to the bricks and tiles underground. Under the enemy's extortion, Changli is almost empty, but it still has to collect 660,000 catties of grain every month, reaching the highest level of apportionment. Shops in Wuqing County town cannot bear the extortion and have all closed down. In Tong County, a large number of enemy troops are stationed, and there are numerous apportionments. The surtax for supplying the enemy troops exceeds twenty times the original business tax of the merchants. The Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes and levies are even more cruel than those of the Japanese puppet era. In the Ping-Bao line area of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the enemy troops in Mancheng have cut down all the trees in the villages they occupy (the county seat has been liberated by our army), but they still have to requisition wood; all the able-bodied men have fled, but they still have to seize laborers. All the shops in the four market towns under the enemy's occupation in Laishui (the county seat has been liberated by our army) have closed their doors. The enemy in Zhuo County plans to extort 4.3 million catties of wheat this year in 24 townships, and 1.54 million catties have been collected in the first half of the year. In the seven counties of Xincheng, Dingxing, Xiongxian, Baxian, Guan, Xinzhen, and Rongcheng in central Hebei (the county seats of Xiong, Ba, Xinzhen, and Rongcheng have been liberated by our army), the enemy collects 15 catties of corn per mu of land every month, and temporary levies are added when enemy troops pass through. Eighty percent of peacetime expenditures come from apportionments. When Baxian city was in the hands of the enemy, the businesses were overwhelmed and all became vendors. In Huairou County town on the Ping-Gu railway line, there were originally fifty or sixty shops, but more than forty have closed due to unbearable extortion and difficult living conditions.

Most of these heavy burdens fall on the poor peasants, while the big landlords "live in the city but bleed the countryside, refuse to pay any burdens, and say they can talk to the county magistrate about anything." For example, in "Lucun Village" in Daxing County, "more than half of the land is not paying grain." The dispatch concludes: "Looking at the whole from this corner, the people's burden is used to the last grain of rice." The article also reveals that the Kuomintang's vigorous propaganda of a "bumper harvest" in its Hebei-controlled areas this year is aimed at concealing its more frantic exploitation and extortion.

　　河北国民党统治区
  　人民负担沉重
    【新华社华北二十二日电】据七月三十一日出版的上海观察周刊所载河北通讯披露：河北国民党统治区，村镇人民负担沉重，工商业凋敝，人民生活痛苦。在冀东，丰润县的摊派每亩地要出到七十二斤。滦县从一九四六年起常遭地震，但其破坏却不如国民党搜刮的彻底，敌军从每一家的房顶到地下的砖瓦都查过了一遍。昌黎在敌人的榨取下，城内差不多逃空了，但每月还要征粮六十六万斤，摊派到了最高度。武清县城商店不堪勒索，已全部停闭。通县敌军大量驻扎，摊派繁多，供应敌军的附加税超过商家原有营业税的二十倍，国民党的横征暴敛，比之日伪时代尤为残酷。平汉铁路北段平、保线两侧地区，满城敌将其所占乡村（按县城已为我军解放）的树木都砍光了，但还要征发木头；壮丁都逃亡了，还要抓丁。涞水敌盘踞下的四个集镇（按县城已为我军解放）的商店全部关了门。涿县敌在廿四个乡镇中预算今年勒索四百卅万斤小麦，上半年已征去一百五十四万斤。冀中新城、定兴、雄县、霸县、固安、新镇、容城七县（按其中雄、霸、新镇、容城四县城已为我军解放），敌每月每亩地征十五斤玉米，敌军过境时还临时加派，平时开支由摊派而来的占百分之八十。霸县城在敌人手中时，商号不堪重负，全部变成摊贩。平、古铁路线上的怀柔县城，原有商店五、六十家，因不堪苛索及生活困难，已关了四十多家。
    所有这些繁重的负担绝大部分落在贫苦农民的身上，而大地主则“生活在都市，却向农村吸血，任何负担都不肯出，有什么事都表示可以到衙内与县长接谈”，例如大兴县“鹿圈村，有半数以上的土地都是不缴粮”。该通讯结语称：“从这一角落看全体，人民的负担，是用到了最后一粒米。”文末并揭露国民党今年大肆渲染其河北统治区的“大丰收”，目的是为了掩饰其更疯狂的搜刮榨取。
