Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. The historically significant Sixth National Labor Congress of China grandly opened on the 1st of this month in Harbin, the capital of the Northeast Liberated Area, as the People's Liberation War heads towards nationwide victory. This is a grand gathering of the Chinese working class under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, inheriting the glorious traditions of the five national labor congresses from 1922 to 1929, and is also an unprecedented congress of unity of the Chinese working class under the general goal of opposing the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism. The worker representatives attending this congress include representatives from all regions, major industrial sectors, and various trade union organizations across the country. These include representatives from various liberated areas such as North China, East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Central Plains, and Guangdong-Guangxi, representatives from major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and South China, representatives from major industrial sectors such as railways, mines, military industries, electricity, and textiles, as well as representatives from various trade union organizations such as the Liberated Area Federation of Trade Unions, the China Labor Association, and underground democratic trade unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, totaling 504 people (representing a total of 2.83 million organized workers nationwide). Luo Ronghuan, Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CPC and Deputy Political Commissar of the Northeast Military Region, Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of Songjiang Province, and Zhu Qiwen, Mayor of Harbin Special City, attended the meeting; in addition, soldiers of the Northeast People's Liberation Army and representatives from farmers, women, youth and other groups were also selected to attend the congress. The lively gathering fully demonstrates that the Chinese working class has victoriously developed into a powerful organized force under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the past nearly twenty years.

The opening ceremony of the congress solemnly began at 10:00 a.m. on the 1st, amid warm cheers and the singing of the Internationale by all the representatives and guests. First, the presidium of the congress was approved, including: Comrade Stalin, the leader of the working class of the world, Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, Comrade Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrade Kuznetzov, Chairman of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions, and Comrade Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions. When the above list was announced, the honor guard played the Internationale, and all the representatives stood up to pay their respects, cheering enthusiastically for a long time.

Then, Comrade Li Lisan delivered the opening speech on behalf of the presidium, announcing the official opening of the Sixth National Labor Congress! He said: Whether it is the number of people represented by the congress, the industries, departments, or regions, it shows that this congress is truly a great unity of the national working class. Comrade Lisan summarized the great role played by the previous labor congresses and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese working class for their own liberation and for national liberation. Comrade Lisan's opening speech (see separate dispatch) lasted three hours and was interrupted from time to time by cheers and applause from the audience.

Following this, the congress spent half an hour, amid continuous cheers from the representatives, reading out more than fifty congratulatory telegrams and letters received by the congress from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the French General Confederation of Labor, various democratic trade unions in the United States, the Federation of Overseas Chinese Workers in France, as well as domestic China Labor Association and various parties in the Liberated Areas. Then, guests from all walks of life took the stage to congratulate.

First, Comrade Luo Ronghuan, representative of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC and the Headquarters of the Northeast Military Region, spoke. He pointed out that the convening of this congress is a sign of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War. Thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the war has shifted from defense to offense, from scattered guerrilla warfare to highly concentrated and unified offensive and mobile warfare, and has achieved significant victories, and will also achieve victories nationwide. At the same time, he also pointed out that the convening of this congress is also a loud battle call, making the national working class and the people of the whole country more united, carrying forward the tradition of heroic struggle in the past, and marching towards victory by leaps and bounds under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Chairman Mao. Comrade Luo Ronghuan called on the Chinese working class to unite, step up production in the liberated areas, support the front lines, and ensure the supply of materials for the military and civilians; in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, they should actively prepare their forces, cooperate with the offensive of the People's Liberation Army, and liberate all cities. Then, Comrade Lin Feng delivered a speech on behalf of the Northeast Administrative Committee. He believes that the convening of this congress in the Northeast brings infinite glory to the people of the Northeast. He particularly pointed out that the unity of the Chinese working class is strength. Despite countless difficulties, despite how fierce the enemies at home and abroad are, as long as the working class unites and struggles together with all revolutionary classes under the leadership of its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, victory will surely be won. He said: This victory has been realized in the national liberated areas, and will undoubtedly be realized nationwide. Comrade Lin Feng called on the working class in the liberated areas to actively participate in the various constructions of the democratic government, so that the working class will always become the leading force, the core and backbone in the revolutionary camp. Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government, and Zhu Qiwen, Mayor of Harbin Special City, also delivered congratulations to the congress on behalf of the people of the whole province and the whole city, respectively. Then, soldier representative Zhou Shicai, farmer representative Li Xuesi, women's representative Lin De, and youth representative Lin Mo also delivered congratulatory speeches, expressing their willingness to unite with the national working class and fight for the overthrow of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and the establishment of a new China. Every time a guest gave a speech, the audience responded with warm cheers. After the guests from all walks of life finished speaking, more than 500 worker representatives from the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions came to present flags to the congress in a burst of gongs and drums, and cheers resounded inside and outside the venue, and the atmosphere was extremely warm.

Finally, in warm cheers, the congress passed telegrams to Stalin, the leader of the working class of the world, Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At this point, the solemn and warm opening ceremony of the Sixth National Labor Congress of China concluded with the singing of the Internationale.

At 5:00 p.m., the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC, the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the Headquarters of the Northeast Military Region jointly hosted a banquet for the representatives of the congress, and a Peking opera evening was held in the evening, and they enjoyed themselves until late at night.
