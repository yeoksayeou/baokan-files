Jinnan Administrative Office Issues Circular
Planting Trees and Cultivating Seedlings, Collecting and Storing Tree Seeds, Preventing Floods, Protecting Embankments, and Regulating Rainfall
[Jinnan Electric] In order to meet the needs of long-term construction, prevent floods, protect embankments, and regulate rainfall, the Jinnan Administrative Office issued a circular on the plan for planting trees and cultivating seedlings and collecting and storing tree seeds for the second half of the year on the 24th of last month. The circular estimates that the total number of seedlings needed for public and private tree planting in the Jinnan area, including embankments, roadsides, and 40,000 hectares of sandy wasteland, is more than 300 million. To cultivate so many seedlings in three to five years, public and private nurseries will need a total area of more than 300 hectares.

The circular requires local construction departments to: (1) accurately investigate the area of sandy wasteland, the length of riverbanks and highways and railways, the total number of seedlings needed, and study which tree species are suitable for certain soil types, and the number of mu of public and private nurseries each county needs to operate; (2) During the rainy season, a large number of *qi liu* should be planted and willow cuttings should be planted, as well as other trees suitable for planting in the hot weather. Organize the masses to take care of the trees; (3) After the leaves fall from the trees and before the ground freezes, take advantage of the agricultural slack season to urge the masses to plant trees that can be planted; (4) Red *jing* branches should be planted about one foot long after autumn or next spring and inserted into alkaline land, which can not only harvest basket strips, but also improve alkaline land; (5) Call on the masses to collect and store various tree seeds. The county construction section can estimate the number of tree seeds needed for the development of public nurseries in the county in the next two years, and collect or purchase and store them by themselves; (6) Requirements and reward methods for cultivating seedlings: (1) The county construction section should actively take charge of the nurseries in each county. Plan the area of ​​seedlings to be cultivated in the county nurseries this year, and it is best to achieve two to five mu; (2) Promote private nurseries, and call on the masses to widely cultivate seedlings and cuttings; (3) Reward elementary school student nurseries; (4) Those who cultivate seedlings and cuttings on more than one mu of cultivated land (non-residential side plots and vacant land), and those who can cultivate more than 500 trees in a year, will be rewarded for every 500 trees they cultivate, and will be reported to the district-level government or above for inspection and registration in the autumn. After the seedlings grow up, the government will assist in sales.
