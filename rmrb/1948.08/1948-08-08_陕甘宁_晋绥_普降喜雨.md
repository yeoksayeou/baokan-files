    Widespread Welcome Rains
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th dispatch] Welcome rains in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan regions. From July 23rd to 29th, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region experienced widespread heavy rain, with depths reaching four to six inches. The previously drought-stricken and yellowed autumn fields turned green, bringing immense joy to the farmers. Farmers, along with production personnel from government organizations and mutual aid teams, mobilized and braved the rain to rush planting and replanting late autumn crops. In the Yan'an area, many late-planted millet crops on the mountainsides had withered due to the sun, and replanting is now actively underway. In the Suide sub-district, counties are universally rushing to plant autumn vegetables and buckwheat and are carrying out the second weeding of autumn fields. Farmers in the Longdong, Sanbian, and Huanglong sub-districts are also engaged in intensive planting after the heavy rains. From the 18th to the 24th, northwestern Shanxi also experienced widespread welcome rains. Most of the drought-stricken autumn crops were saved, with Shuoxian and other areas estimating a harvest of 70-80%. All areas are now intensifying weeding efforts and are replanting or supplementing early-maturing crops on farmland where crops had withered. Following the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in central Shanxi, this widespread rain is seen by the masses as a "double blessing."
