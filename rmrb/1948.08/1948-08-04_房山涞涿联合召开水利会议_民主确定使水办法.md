    Fangshan and Laizhu Jointly Convene Water Conservancy Conference
    Democratically Determine Water Usage Methods
    [Chahar Electric] Fangshan and Laizhu counties convened a water conservancy conference on July 3rd for 59 beneficiary villages along the east and west banks of the Juma River, establishing the Juma River Water Conservancy Association and resolving years of water disputes. The Juma River flows through Fangshan and Laizhu counties, dividing into the east and west river channels at Tiesuoya. The west river benefits 36 villages in the first, third, and sixth districts of Laizhu; the east river benefits 13 villages in the third district of Fangshan, and 8 villages in the sixth and seventh districts of Laizhu, totaling 21 villages. The west river channel is low and narrow with a stone bed, making water usage convenient; the east river has more silt and a higher riverbed, with a longer channel (33 li from Tiesuoya to Guanxianying), often resulting in water shortages. During droughts, the water volume is even more insufficient, leading to many disputes between the two rivers in the past.
    In order to rationally utilize the water resources of the two rivers, resolve disputes, and increase production, Fangshan and Laizhu counties initiated this conference. Sixty-three representatives from beneficiary villages along the two rivers attended. Eleven members were democratically elected to the Two Rivers Water Conservancy Association (three each from the east and west river branches, one each from the industry departments of the two counties, one each from the mass organizations of the two counties, and one from the special commissioner's office). The director of the association is Wang Yushan, director of the west river branch, and the deputy director is Weng Baoshun, director of the east river branch. The association is directly under the leadership of the special commissioner's office, and the association has two branches, east and west, under its jurisdiction, which are under the leadership of the county.
    During the meeting, representatives from both rivers reported on their respective water conservancy situations, exchanged experiences, and studied solutions to problems. The lower-level organization of the East River Water Association was very unsound, and localism and egalitarianism often occurred in water use in various villages, and disputes often arose in downstream villages. The West River Water Association divides groups according to canal rivers, and selects 12 group leaders to be responsible for covering ditches, drawing water, guarding ditches, and resolving various disputes. The method of centralized use and intensive water use has been adopted, and the effect is very good. For example, due to water seepage in the ditches of Wei Village, Xuejia Village, and Nanbeilangtou, the entire area could not be irrigated. The West River Branch convened a meeting of group leaders and decided to cover the water in the waterway ditches and release it downstream for three days, so that the downstream could be irrigated. The West River Water Association also built 37 sluice gates and improved the water blocking method, overcoming the shortcomings of digging ditches. Based on the experience of both parties, after heated discussions, the meeting decided on measures to rectify the East River Water Association: (1) Stipulate water usage covenants and adopt a centralized water usage method. (2) Take care of military families, workers' families, families of martyrs, and households without labor. Those who carry soil to build dikes and have labor at home should work as usual; those with half labor should work 40%; households without labor should be fully taken care of; military families, workers' families, and families of martyrs in guerrilla areas and enemy-occupied areas should be taken care of by half. (3) When Guanxianying, Lanxianying, Maotun, Maolin and other four villages use water, the branch will be responsible for covering the water downstream so that the land in the downstream villages can be irrigated. (4) Improve the organizational structure, establish large groups according to the road channel, and set up small groups (that is, household groups in each village). When covering ditches and drawing water, the group leader will uniformly mobilize and be responsible for guarding the ditches, and the beneficiary villages will provide meals. The meeting also decided that when the water is high after rain, each canal should use muddy water to silt up, improve the soil, increase fertilizer, and lay the foundation for harvesting wheat. It is also necessary to check the canal dams, study the water discharge problem, and pay attention to flood prevention to avoid flooding villages and land.

    房山涞涿联合召开水利会议
    民主确定使水办法
    【察哈尔电】房山、涞涿两县于七月三日召开拒马河东、西两河五十九个受益村的水利会议，成立两河水利总会，解决了历年的水利纠纷。拒马河流经房山、涞涿两县境，至铁锁崖分成东河、西河两大渠道。西河受益村有涞涿一、三、六区共三十六个村；东河受益村有房山三区十三个村，涞涿六、七区八个村，共二十一个村。西河道低窄、石底用水方便；东河多淤沙底，河道高，河身长（由铁锁崖到关仙营共三十三里），使水常感缺乏。天旱时水量更不够用，过去两河纠纷很多。
    房山、涞涿两县为了合理的使用两河水利，解决纠纷，增加生产，乃发起召开这个会议。到会两河受益村代表六十三人。民主选出两河水利总会委员十一人（计东、西两河分会各三人，两县实业科各一人、两县群众团体各一人，专署一人）。总会正主任为西河分会主任王玉山，副主任为东河分会主任翁保顺。总会直接受专署领导，总会下设东、西河两分会，分会受县领导。
    会中两河代表报告各方水利情况，交流经验，研究解决问题。东河水会下层组织很不健全，各村使水时常发生本位主义和平均主义的偏向，下游村庄常起纠纷。西河水会按渠河划分小组，选出组长十二人负责掩沟、拉水、看沟，解决发生的各种纠纷。采用集中使用、突击使水的办法，效果很好。如魏村、薛家庄、南北浪头因沟里渗水，不能全部灌溉，西河分会就召集了小组长会议，决定掩住水道沟的水，往下放三天，下游都浇到了。西河水会并修了水闸三十七个，改进了挡水办法，克服了挖地淤沟的缺点。根据双方经验，经过热烈讨论，会上决定了东河水会整顿办法：（一）规定使水公约，采用集中使水办法。（二）照顾军、工、烈属及无劳力户。挑土培堤来，家中有劳力的照常上工；有半劳力的出工十分之四；无劳力户全部照顾；游击区、敌占区的军、工、烈属照顾二分之一。（三）关仙营、蓝仙营、毛屯、茂林等四村用水时，由分会负责往下掩水，使下游村庄土地得到灌溉。（四）健全组织机构，按路道成立大组，下设小组（即各村地户小组），在掩沟拉水时，由组长统一调动，负责看沟，吃饭由受益村供给。会上又决定雨后水大时，各渠要利用浑水放淤，改良土壤，增加肥料，打下收麦基础。并要检查渠坝，研究出水问题，注意防洪，以免冲村冲地。
