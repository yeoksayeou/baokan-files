　　Organizing Different Production According to Different Regions
  　Renqiu, Anping and Other Counties Vigorously Carry Out Disaster Relief
    [Jizhong Dispatch] Party and government leading organs in Renqiu, Anping and other places are vigorously supporting disaster area people in production, and helping disaster victims solve difficulties such as housing and food. The Renqiu County Party Committee, according to the flood situation, decided to organize different production avenues according to different regions. For example, in the 31 villages along the Ten Li Embankment, such as Liang溝, the main task is to organize the masses to fish, followed by transportation and sales, and workshops. Those who lack capital are supported with loans. Villages in Baiyangdian should organize the masses to pick water chestnuts and pick purslane. The county has already lent 20 million yuan of loans and 140,000 jin of grain that have not yet been issued in non-disaster areas to the masses in disaster areas to support production. It also used 3 million yuan to purchase mats from villages with weaving habits and transported them to Botou and other places for sale. The county's carpentry and iron factory has begun to manufacture waterwheels, foreign machines, and wind bows. In ten days, it has already built two large foreign machines and two wind turbines. The Cooperative is planning wheat seeds, preparing to help the masses plant wheat. The Anping Party and government organs concentrated 55 cadres and went to the disaster areas to carry out disaster relief. The first step was to help the masses build embankments around the villages, and move the old and weak who had no housing to other villages. Those who did not move out of the village were lent mats by the Cooperative to build shacks. It also called on the masses to help each other, those who had food lent it to those who did not, and repaid it later; those who had houses lent them to those who did not have temporary residence. Gaoyang also organized cadres to go to the countryside to understand the disaster situation, solve the food and housing problems of the victims, and organized the masses to plant buckwheat, plant vegetables, pick tree leaves, and collect wild vegetables to prepare for famine. It also plans to issue loans and seeds, and organize disaster areas to develop sideline production. Suning and Wuji Cooperatives have purchased buckwheat seeds and lent them to the masses.
    [Jizhong Dispatch] The 11th Sub-district of Jizhong is actively rescuing the flood. The Party and government organs of the sub-district sent Wang, the chief of the Civil Affairs Section, and others to form two groups to go to Jin County, Gaocheng and other disaster areas to assist in the work. The Cooperatives of Wuji, Jin County, and Shulu Counties have prepared buckwheat seeds and vegetable seeds in various ways. The Wuji Cooperative has purchased 22 shi of buckwheat seeds and lent them to the masses. The Zhong Haozhuang Farmers' Association, which was severely affected by the disaster, bought 32 shi of buckwheat seeds and lent them to households that had no money to buy seeds. Other districts have held village cadre meetings, calling on people to plant buckwheat and vegetables on the flooded land. In order to organize the masses to spin and weave to overcome the famine, the Jizhong Yufeng Store of the Cooperative allocated 6,000 jin of cotton to sell to households that spin thread and weave cloth. The Cooperative also exchanged cotton for thread and cloth to help the masses develop spinning and weaving. At present, spinning and weaving is very popular in the disaster areas. In Beiyuan Village, 240 machines and more than 700 spinning wheels have all been put into operation.

　　按照不同地区组织不同生产
  　任邱安平等县大力救灾
    【冀中电】任邱、安平等地党政领导机关，大力扶助灾区群众生产，帮助灾民解决住房、吃饭等困难。任邱县委根据水灾情况，决定按照不同地区，组织不同生产门路。如沿十里堤的梁沟等三十一个村，主要是组织群众捕鱼，其次是运销和作坊。对没本钱的则用贷款扶助。白洋淀里的村庄，应组织群众采菱角，挑马生菜。该县已把非灾区尚未发放的贷款两千万元、粮食十四万斤贷给灾区群众，扶植生产。并以三百万元到有织席习惯的村庄收席，往泊头等地运销。该县木工铁厂已开始造水车、造洋机、风弓，十天中已造好两张大洋机，两个风轮。推进社正筹划麦种，准备帮助群众种麦。安平党政机关，集中了五十五个干部，分头到灾区救灾。首先帮助群众修筑围村埝，把没房住的老弱搬到别村去，不搬出村的由推进社贷给席子搭窝棚。并号召群众互助互济，有吃的借给没吃的，日后再还；有房的借给没房的暂住。高阳也组织干部下乡了解灾情，解决灾民吃住问题，并组织群众种荞麦、种菜、采树叶、打野菜，准备渡荒。还计划发放贷款、贷种，组织灾区开展副业生产。肃宁、无极推进社都购买了荞麦种，贷给群众。
    【冀中电】冀中十一分区正积极抢救水灾。分区党政机关派民政科王科长等组成两个小组，分赴晋县、藁城等灾区协助工作。无极、晋县、束鹿等县推进社多方筹备荞麦种和菜籽。无极推进社已购买荞麦种二十二石贷给群众。受灾较重的中郝庄农会买了三十二石荞麦种，借给没钱买种籽的户。其他各区都召开了村干部会，号召把水淹过的地种上荞麦和蔬菜。为组织群众纺织渡荒，推进社冀中裕丰商店拨棉花六千斤，卖给纺线织布的户，推进社并以棉换线换布，帮助群众开展纺织。现灾区各村纺织很烘火，北远村二百四十张机子，七百多架纺车，已都动起来。
