    △Mr. Liu Zuozhen: If your family truly has no feudal exploitation and relies only on your brothers working as shop assistants and the family farming some land, then naturally you should not be struggled against. If you have already been struggled against, you can discuss compensation with the farmers' association and the village government.
    △Mr. Du Rugui: According to your letter, it is incorrect to classify your family as rich peasants. The confiscated production tools and other properties should, of course, be appropriately returned or compensated.
    △Messrs. Zhang Chenguang, Yang Kaigong, and Yang Huaizong:
    In order to facilitate the exchange of goods between regions and to benefit farmers' production, it is permissible to request the restoration of the old market in your village. The original letter has been forwarded to the Xingtai County Government, please ask them to help you resolve this.
    △Mr. Yun Cheng: It is wrong to confiscate the salary and rice that teachers are entitled to. It should be returned.
    △Messrs. He Qianyuan, Shouwen, and Zhengming: Families of military personnel with labor should naturally not receive the same amount of substitute farming as families of military personnel without labor. Substitute farming can be appropriately granted or not granted based on the specific situation and the amount of labor available. Political and civilian cadres should be handled according to the government's regulations on substitute farming for revolutionary staff and workers' families.
    △Mr. Zhou Maoxiang: As a shop assistant, according to item B of Article 10 of the Land Law Outline, you can be allocated part or one share of land based on your income.

    △刘作桢君：若你家中确无封建剥削，只靠你弟兄做店员及家中养种田地生活，自然不应斗争。已经斗了的，可商请农会和村政府研究补偿。
    △杜如桂君：据来信所谈，你家成份划成富农，是不正确的，被没收的生产工具和其他财产等，当然应适当退回或补偿。
    △张辰光、杨凯恭、杨怀宗君：
    为了交流各地货物，便利农民生产，要求在你村恢复旧有的集市是可以的，原信已转邢台县府，请他们帮助你们解决。
    △云程君：教员应得之薪金米被没收是不对的，应当退还。
    △何乾元、守文、正明君：有劳力军属自然不能和没劳力军属同样代耕，可按具体情况劳力多少适当予以代耕或不代耕，政民干部则按政府规定的革命职员家属代耕办法处理。
    △周茂香君：你当店员，按照土地法大纲第十条乙项规定，可以根据你的收入情况，分得部分或一份土地。
