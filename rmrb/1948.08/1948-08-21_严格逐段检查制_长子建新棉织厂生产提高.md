　　Strict Step-by-Step Inspection System
  　Changzi Jianxin Cotton Weaving Factory Improves Production
    [Taiyue Electric] The Changzi Jianxin Private Cotton Weaving Factory has achieved effective management, increased production, reduced costs, and smooth sales. Jianxin was originally a public handicraft factory with a capital of 1,000 shi of millet and 54 employees. It produced socks, vests, blankets, various towels, bedspreads, and mattress cores. The main raw material relied on absorbing spun yarn from women in various villages. In April, the public operation was converted to private ownership and taken over by Chen Wenjing and others. First, 33% of the non-production personnel were laid off. A strict system of step-by-step responsibility and step-by-step inspection was established. From the initial stage of workers receiving yarn from the storekeeper to the final stage of handing over finished products to the storekeeper, each stage was completed with each person signing for handover. This ensured that quality would not be affected by quantity competition and greatly reduced the waste of raw materials. In the past, the factory accumulated about 20 jin of cotton yarn per month, but now it is only a maximum of 3 jin per month. Secondly, a progressive wage system of five grades and sixteen levels was implemented, stipulating a progressive point-adding and bonus system for exceeding the standard production volume. For weaving workers, a standard output of 26 bolts of cloth per month was set, rated at 1.5 points. Exceeding by one bolt added 0.1 points, and two bolts added 0.3 points. This greatly stimulated production enthusiasm and improved efficiency by leaps and bounds. Weaving workers produced an average of 18 bolts of cloth per month during the public operation. In June, they wove 27 bolts, and Chang Baigou, the worker with the highest output, wove 33 bolts. In addition to receiving a monthly wage of 1 shi and 4 dou of millet (food, bathing, and haircuts provided by the factory), they also received a bonus of 6 dou of millet. In the past, sock weavers produced two dozen pairs per day, now increased to five dozen pairs. Blanket weavers produced two blankets per day in the past, now increased to three and a half blankets. In terms of weaving, the average output of the entire factory increased by 50%, and sock production increased by 150%. Thirdly, the factory employees jointly discussed and formulated labor discipline, and appropriately stipulated workers' vacations. Workers had four days off per month with full pay. Those who overstayed their leave without reason had to make up the work. Those who damaged tools or finished products were subject to criticism, and those who repeatedly failed to correct their behavior and whose circumstances were serious were dismissed. Due to the above improvements, production from April to June increased by an average of 85%, and there were also significant improvements in quality and technology. In the past, only five patterns could be woven, now fifteen or sixteen types can be made. In April, the cost of each bolt of cloth was 3 dou and 8 sheng of rice, which was reduced to 2 dou and 8 sheng in June. Each dozen of socks was reduced from 2 dou to 1 dou and 5 sheng. Each blanket was reduced from 2 dou and 5 sheng to 2 dou. In addition, based on market seasonal needs, planned production was carried out, and long-term customer relationships were established with small merchants in various places. Therefore, finished products were sold quickly, and the sales area covered Changzhi, Anze, Qinshui and other places. The average daily wholesale value of the store reached about 1 million yuan. From April to June, the factory had a profit of 11 million yuan.

　　严格逐段检查制
  　长子建新棉织厂生产提高
    【太岳电】长子建新私营棉织厂经营管理得法，产量提高，成本降低，销路畅达。建新原系一公营手工业工厂，资本一千石小米，有职工五十四人，出产有袜子、背心、线毯、各色毛巾、被面、褥心等，原料主要靠吸收各村妇女纺线。四月份公营转为私营，由陈文景等接办后，首先裁减了百分之三十三的非生产人员。规定了严格的逐段负责与逐段检查制度，从工人最初向保管员领线一直到最后向保管交成品，每段做完都由各人署名交接，这样保证了不致因数量竞争而影响质量降低，并大大节省了原料的浪费。该厂过去每月积存的棉线常在二十斤左右，现在每月最多时只有三斤。其次，实行了五等十六级累进等级工资制，规定了超过标准生产量时累进加分分红制度。织布工人以每月织布二十六匹为标准产量，定为一分半。超过一匹加一厘，两匹加三厘。这样大大刺激了生产情绪，效率飞跃提高。织布工人公营时期每月平均每人产布十八匹，六月份织到二十七匹，产量最高的常白狗织到三十三匹。除月得工资一石四斗小米外（伙食、洗澡、剃头由厂方供给），又得分红米六斗。织袜过去每人日出两打，现在增到五打，织毯过去每人日出两条，现在增到三条半。织布方面，全厂平均增加产量百分之五十，织袜增产百分之一百五十。第三，厂方职工共同议定了劳动纪律，又适当规定了工人的假期，每月工人休假四天，工资照发。无故过假不归者须补工，损坏工具成品者须受批评，屡次不改、情节严重者解雇。由于以上种种改进，四月到六月生产都平均提高百分之八十五，质量上、技术上也大有改进。过去只能织五种花纹，现在会做十五六种。四月份每匹布成本三斗八升米，六月减低到二斗八升。每打袜子由二斗减到一斗五升。毯子每个由二斗五升减到二斗。再加根据市场季节需要，有计划的生产，和各地小商建立了长期的主顾关系，所以成品销售很快，行销地区遍及长治、安泽、沁水等地。门市每日批发价额平均达一百万元左右。四月至六月，该厂已获利一千一百万元。
