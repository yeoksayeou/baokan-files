Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 6th. Jiang Shutang, a photographer for a front-line branch of this agency, gloriously died in the line of duty during the battle to liberate Yanzhou. On the afternoon of July 12th, when the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against the enemy in Yanzhou, Jiang braved intense artillery fire to capture vivid shots of the soldiers courageously building bridges at the edge of the position. Later, he followed the assault troops as they scaled the western city wall, and was unfortunately struck by enemy artillery fire at dawn on the 13th, sacrificing his life heroically. Jiang Shutang was from Yaqian (newly established county) in Jiaodong, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and was only twenty-three years old at the time of his death.
