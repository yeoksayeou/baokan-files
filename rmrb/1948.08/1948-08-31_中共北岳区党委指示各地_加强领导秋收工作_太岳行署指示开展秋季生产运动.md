　　[North Yue Dispatch] As the autumn harvest approaches, the CCP North Yue District Committee has issued instructions regarding autumn harvest work. It begins by stating: "The success or failure of the autumn harvest will determine whether we can ultimately and fully reap the fruits of the arduous efforts made by the military and civilians of the North Yue District in production work over the past year. Party committees at all levels must attach great importance to this final stage of agricultural production, and study plans and specifically organize forces as soon as possible." The instructions put forward the following requirements: (1) During the autumn harvest, all localities must make the autumn harvest the central task, and organize all forces to complete it. During this period, in addition to necessary war mobilization work, other work should be carried out in conjunction with and subordinate to the autumn harvest; when necessary, other work may even be temporarily suspended in the short term to concentrate all efforts on the autumn harvest. (2) In the autumn harvest, all localities must conscientiously mobilize all available labor in rural areas, especially female labor, as well as children and the elderly, and assign them specific tasks in the autumn harvest. For families lacking labor, especially the families of martyrs, soldiers, cadres, and conscripted militia and laborers, leading organs at all levels should pay the greatest attention to helping them solve difficulties. (3) In border and guerrilla areas, local military groups, work teams, district squads, and militia must, under unified command, actively and proactively strike at the enemy's grain grabbing. Local Party, government, and civilian cadres should, under the armed cover of the troops and militia, actively organize the masses to harvest, collect, and store quickly, seizing the time to complete the autumn harvest. We must never allow the enemy to seize grain from our hands. The experience of protecting the autumn harvest in the past should be carefully studied and adopted. (4) In order to ensure that the autumn harvest can be completed on time, all Party, government, military, civilian, rear area organs, troops, and schools must mobilize all personnel during the autumn harvest, spare time from work to help the masses carry out the autumn harvest. First of all, it is necessary to help the families of martyrs, soldiers, cadres, and conscripted militia and laborers who lack labor. This work should be regarded as an important task for all rear area organs, troops, and schools during the autumn harvest. (5) Autumn harvest, wheat planting, autumn grain tax collection, and autumn plowing are interconnected tasks. After completing the autumn harvest, all localities should immediately organize forces to launch a concentrated effort to plant wheat, collect autumn grain taxes, and carry out autumn plowing. In wheat planting and autumn plowing, the same spirit and methods of the concentrated autumn harvest should be used to ensure that all land suitable for wheat planting is planted according to plan, and all arable land is cultivated.

　　[Another Dispatch] In order to prevent pests and diseases and strengthen fertilizer application, the North Yue District Committee has issued another instruction, emphasizing that pest and disease damage in various localities has gradually been eliminated through efforts to control and prevent it. However, the seasonal nature of armyworm and rice borer disasters has not yet passed, so close attention must still be paid to inspection and supervision. Regarding fertilizer application, it is required that Party committees at all levels seize the favorable season, promptly deploy and inspect, and have certain county and district cadres personally take charge, so as to achieve results, complete the plan, and submit systematic and specific reports to the District Committee.

　　[Taiyue Dispatch] The Taiyue Administrative Office issued instructions today on launching an autumn agricultural production campaign, stating: "Due to the widespread soil preparation last year and the even distribution of rainfall this spring, especially since the correction of deviations, the masses' enthusiasm for production has greatly changed, making this year's autumn seedlings particularly lush, and a bumper autumn harvest is expected." The District Committee pointed out that the main content of production is to do a good job in the autumn harvest, plant wheat fields well, accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, and carry out widespread autumn soil preparation. (1) To do a good job in the autumn harvest, it is necessary to lead the masses to harvest on time and carry out field seed selection. If conditions permit, the village production committee should cooperate with experienced old farmers to investigate and collect various grain and vegetable varieties with high yields and good quality in the village. Hold short-term variety exhibitions. Implement comparison planting and evaluation planting to mobilize the masses to select, exchange, and educate the masses on proper methods of seed storage. Mobilize iron and wood workers to manufacture and sell agricultural tools. Organize the masses to timely acquire agricultural tools for autumn harvest use. There may be early frost this year, so remind the masses to prevent frost, promote frost prevention experience, protect autumn crops, and call on the masses to pay close attention to the occurrence of pests such as armyworms, autumn locusts, and rice borers. (2) Organize the masses to plant existing wheat fields well, and in areas with new wasteland, abundant labor, and suitable climate, try to eliminate new wasteland and expand wheat fields as much as possible. Before plowing and planting, manure must be transported as early as possible. According to labor and livestock conditions, and the farming habits of farmers in various places, strive to plow the wheat fields two to four times. Apply an average of forty loads of manure per mu, and twenty-five loads in mountainous areas. Organize seed selection and exchange, and promote warm water seed soaking to ensure that diseased wheat is not planted. (3) Conscientiously organize the masses to accumulate and compost large amounts of fertilizer, cut artemisia and chop branches before autumn, and compost rice roots, straws, and miscellaneous branches and leaves after autumn. Regularly pay attention to padding the pen and collecting manure. According to the specific conditions and farmers' experience in various places, organize symposiums of experienced old farmers to formulate specific plans and specific goals when necessary. (4) After the autumn harvest, lead the masses to carry out autumn soil preparation. Yuebei District should harvest and prepare the soil at the same time during the autumn harvest, and YueNan District should prepare the soil immediately after harvesting. Households with livestock difficulties should be mobilized to replace livestock work with manual work, or replace livestock power with human-pulled plows, grabbing plows, etc. In areas where male labor is scarce, more attention should be paid to promoting old farmers and women to plow, so as to achieve the effect of fine and fast plowing. Ensure that people and livestock are not idle until the land is completely prepared. It is necessary to implement the policy of organizing and strengthening the leadership of mutual assistance and cooperation. All possible labor, especially the labor of the vast number of women, must be organized under the principle of voluntariness and put into the autumn production campaign. The instruction stated: "In terms of leadership methods: (1) Taking the county as a unit, the above-mentioned work must be deployed to the villages after the end of summer heat. First of all, mobilize the cadres to make them deeply aware that without doing a good job in this year's autumn production, there will be no bumper harvest next year. All organs and groups should immediately organize the work of their departments, allocate a certain amount of time and energy, and specialize in leading autumn production. At the village level, improve the production committee, and absorb experienced old farmers and women who are active, enthusiastic, and have experience in autumn production to strengthen the leadership in production organization and technology. During the busy autumn production season, cadres and the masses should all go to the fields, go deep into the masses, help the masses produce, and solve the difficulties of the masses. The production of military and martyrs' families should be guaranteed to be done early and well. The villages where various military and political organs and groups are located should allocate a large amount of human and animal power to participate in the local mass production to help solve the difficulties of labor and animal power." The instruction also emphasized that in autumn production, it is necessary to timely cultivate and discover labor heroes and model figures who can truly play a driving and leading role and have a practical connection with the masses. Finally, the Administrative Office solemnly announced in the instructions that in order to dispel the concerns of the masses and enable them to engage in production with peace of mind, we once again announced to the farmers regarding the land ownership issue that the land reform in our region has been largely completed, and the land ownership has been largely determined, and will not be changed in the future. Even if a small amount of land (such as the surplus land of individual landlords and rich peasants, and the land encroached upon by a few people, etc.) needs to be adjusted, the government guarantees that whoever plants will harvest. The labor spent on autumn fields and autumn production such as stacking, filling pits, etc., should be evaluated by the farmers' association, and the land-receiving households should fairly return the labor or pay the capital. Accumulated fertilizer belongs to whoever accumulates it, and agricultural producers who lack labor or intend to expand their operations are allowed to hire workers to plant land (including long-term and short-term workers). In addition to the provisions of the labor law, the employment conditions should be negotiated by the employer and the employee.

    太岳行署指示开展秋季生产运动
    【北岳电】秋收将至，中共北岳区党委特发出关于秋收工作的指示。首称：一年来我北岳区军民在生产工作中艰辛努力的成果，能否最后完全取得，决定于秋收之成败。各级党委必须十分重视农业生产中这一最后阶段的工作，及早研究计划与具体组织力量。指示提出下列要求：（一）秋收期间，各地必须以秋收为中心工作，组织一切力量来完成它。在此期间，除必要的战争动员工作以外，其他工作都应在服从秋收工作的前提下结合进行；必要时，甚至可在短期内暂停其他工作，集中全力进行秋收。（二）在秋收工作中，各地必须认真把农村现有一切可能的劳动力，特别是妇女劳动力及儿童与老年，都动员起来，使他们担任秋收工作中一定的任务。对缺乏劳动力的家庭，首先是烈、军、干属以及出征民兵、民工的家属，各级领导机关应以最大的注意，帮助他们解决困难。（三）在边缘区游击区，各地方兵团、武工队、区小队与民兵，必须在统一指挥下，积极主动地打击敌人抢粮，党、政、民地方干部，应在部队与民兵的武装掩护下，积极组织群众快打、快收、快藏，抓紧时间，完成秋收。绝不使敌人从我们手里抢走粮食。过去护秋护麦的经验，应注意研究采用。（四）为了使秋收工作能按时完成，各级党、政、军、民、后方机关、部队与学校，在秋收期间，必须动员全体人员，抽出工余时间，帮助群众进行秋收。首先要帮助缺乏劳动力的烈、军、干属与出征民兵民工家属。这一工作应作为各后方机关、部队及学校在秋收期间的一个重要任务。（五）秋收、种麦、秋征、秋耕是相互连接着的工作，各地在完成秋收工作后，应即组织力量突击种麦秋征与秋耕。在种麦秋耕中，同样应以突击秋收的精神与办法，争取可以种麦的地都按计划种好，能耕的地全部耕过。
    【又讯】为防止病虫害与加强压肥工作，北岳区党委再发指示，着重指出各地虫害经努力扑打防除，已逐渐消灭，但目前黏虫、稻蚕灾害的季节性尚未过去，故仍须严密注意检查督促。关于压肥工作，要求各级党委抓紧良好季节，即时布置检查，由一定县区干部亲自掌握，务须做出成绩，完成计划，并向区党委作系统具体的报告。
    【太岳电】太岳行署于本日发出关于开展秋季农业生产运动的指示，内称：由于去年普遍刹地，今春雨水调匀，特别是纠偏以来，群众生产情绪大有转变，使今年秋苗特别茂盛，秋禾可望丰收。区党委指出生产的主要内容是作好秋收，种好麦田，大量积肥，普遍秋刹。（一）作好秋收必须领导群众按时收割并进行田间选种。如条件许可，应由村生产委员会协同有经验的老农调查采集村中产量高、质量好的各种粮菜品种。举行短时间品种展览会。实行比种、评种，动员群众选种换种，并教育群众以妥藏种籽方法。动员铁木工人，制造推销农具。组织群众及时办置农具，以便秋收使用。今年可能早霜，要提醒群众防霜，宣传防霜经验，保护秋禾，号召群众密切注意黏虫、秋蝗、稻蚕等害虫发生。（二）组织群众种好原有麦田，并在有新荒、劳力多，气候适宜的地区，尽量消灭新荒，扩大麦田。在犁种前必须及早运粪，依据劳畜力条件，及各地农民耕作习惯，争取将麦田犁两遍到四遍。每亩平均上粪四十担，山地二十五担。并组织选种换种，提倡温汤浸种，保证不种病麦。（三）认真组织群众大量积肥沤粪，秋前割蒿刹圪梢，秋后沤田禾根秆及杂枝落叶。并经常注意垫圈拾粪。根据各地具体情况及农民经验，必要时组织有积肥经验的老农座谈会，订出具体计划和具体目标。（四）在秋收之后，领导群众进行秋刹。岳北区在秋收中边收边刹，岳南区收完即刹。畜力困难户应动员以人工变畜工，或以人拉犁，抢犁刨地等代替畜力。在男劳力缺乏地区，更应注意提倡老农及妇女掌犁，以收细犁快犁之效。作到地不刹完，人畜不闲。要贯彻组织起来的方针，加强互助合作的领导，必须将一切可能的劳动力，特别是广大妇女的劳力，在自愿原则下组织起来，投入秋季生产运动。指示称：在领导方法上：（一）以县为单位，在处暑后，即须把上述工作布置到村。首先把干部动员起来，使他们深刻认识：不作好今年的秋季生产，就没有明年的丰收。各机关团体应立即组织本部门工作、抽出一定时间和力量，专门领导秋季生产。在村级健全生产委员会，吸收对秋季生产积极热情有经验的老农和妇女参加，以加强生产组织及技术上的领导。在秋季生产紧张时，应实行群众干部都到地里，深入群众、帮助群众生产，解决群众困难。军、烈属家庭生产，更要保证作早作好。各军政机关团体所在村，应大量抽出人畜力，参加当地群众生产，以帮助解决劳畜力困难。该指示并着重指出在秋季生产中要及时培养和发现真正能起推动带头作用，并与群众有切实连系的劳动英雄和模范人物。最后，行署指示中郑重宣布，为解除群众顾虑，使能安心生产，关于地权问题，我们再次向农民宣布，我区土改已大体完成，地权已大体确定，今后不再变动。即使少数土地（如个别地主富农多余的土地，少数人侵占多得的土地等）须加调剂，政府也保证谁种谁收。原来刹过之秋田及秋季生产中叠＠填坑等田中建设所费之工，由农会评定，由得地户公平还工，或付资。积存肥料，谁积归谁，并允许缺乏劳力或企图扩大经营农业生产者雇工种地（包括长工短工），雇用条件除劳动法规定者外，应由主双雇方自行商谈。
