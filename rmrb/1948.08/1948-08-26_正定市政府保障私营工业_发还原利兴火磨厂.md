　　Zhengding Municipal Government Guarantees Private Industry
  　Returning the Yuanli Xing Flour Mill
    [Beiyue News] The Zhengding Municipal Government resolutely protects national industry and commerce. On August 1st, the Yuanli Xing Flour Mill was returned to its original owners. The flour mill, powered by a 24-horsepower steam engine, produced 300 bags of flour per day. It was a joint venture of Wang Lanting and four others. It ceased operations in 1934 due to losses. In 1937, it was leased to Kang Jisheng from Ningjin County. After the Japanese invaders occupied Zhengding, Kang colluded with the Japanese and puppet regime, making considerable profits. After the Japanese surrender, the flour mill was shut down again. In October 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits forcibly "leased" it and forced the masses to "invest," effectively turning it into a flour mill for Hou Ruheng's bandit troops. After we liberated Zhengding, it was mistakenly regarded as bureaucratic capital and confiscated, temporarily operated by the Yufeng Company. After more than a year of investigation, it was confirmed that it was private property, and the democratic government ordered its return. In late July, the Industry and Commerce Section Chief Li of the Administrative Office and the Industry and Commerce Bureau Chief Zhao of the Special Office, together with the Zhengding Municipal Democratic Government, convened a meeting of the old shareholders, explained our party's policy of protecting industry and commerce, and explained that the previous confiscation was wrong due to unclear investigation, and now it would be returned immediately. The shareholders were extremely excited, but at the same time, they felt insufficient funds and were currently unable to operate. After consultation, the government accepted the shareholders' request, and in order to take care of their actual difficulties and not affect production, both parties democratically agreed that the Yufeng Company would temporarily lease it, using the 143,696 jin of rice paid by the government for repairs due to the destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits as shares, accounting for 21.7 percent of the existing shares, and the old shareholders' funds accounting for 78.3 percent. A three-year lease contract was signed, stipulating that the Yufeng Company would be fully responsible for machine repairs, and a rent of two liang of flour would be paid for each bag of flour produced (shareholders can get 37 to 38 jin of flour per day). It was also stipulated that the old shareholders could take it back as private enterprise at any time after the expiration of the contract. After the factory was returned, the shareholders gratefully said: "The flour mill suffered great damage from the enemy and puppet regime, and we had no money to repair it. It was really just a pile of scrap iron. Now the government has repaired it and returned it to us. We are very grateful."

　　正定市政府保障私营工业
  　发还原利兴火磨厂
    【北岳讯】正定市政府坚决保护民族工商业，于八月一日，将原利兴火磨发还原主。该火磨以由二十四马力蒸气机为原动力，日出面粉三百袋，系王兰亭等五人合资经营，民二十三年因赔损停业；民二十六年租与宁晋县康际盛经营，日寇侵占正定后，康与日、伪勾结，获利不少。日寇投降后，火磨又告停顿。民国三十五年十月，蒋匪强迫“租赁”并勒令群众“入股”，实际上成了侯如墉匪部的面粉厂。我解放正定后，误为官僚资本，予以没收，交裕丰公司暂时经营，经一年来多方调查了解。获悉确系私人财产，民主政府遂明令发还。于七月下旬派行署工商局李科长、专署工商局赵局长等会同正定市民主政府，召开旧股东会议，解释我党保护工商业的政策，说明过去未调查清楚，没收错了，现在立即发还，各股东兴奋异常，但同时均感资金不足，目前无力经营。经磋商后，政府接受股东要求，为照顾他们的实际困难，并为了不影响生产双方民主商定，改由裕丰公司暂时租赁，将过去因蒋匪破坏由政府垫付的修理费一四三六九六斤米顶股，占现有股金百分之二十一点七，旧股东资金占百分之七十八点三。另订三年租赁合同，约定机器修理由裕丰公司负全责，每出面一袋交租金面二两（股东可日得三十七、八斤面）。并规定旧股东于合同期满后，可随时收为私营。该厂发还后，股东们感激的说：“火磨遭敌伪破坏很大，我们没钱修理，实在等于一堆废铁，现在公家给修好了，又发还给我们，实在感谢不尽了。”
