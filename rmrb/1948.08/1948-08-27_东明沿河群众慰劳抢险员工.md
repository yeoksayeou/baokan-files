　　[Ji Luyu Electric] The people of the Fourth District of Dongming, witnessing the danger of the engineering teams from various counties braving bombing and strafing by Chiang's planes and the hardship of being soaked by heavy rain, and their selfless efforts day and night to repair the dangerous sections of the Yellow River, which ensured the safety of their lives and property, are sincerely grateful and have been sending cigarettes and pigs to comfort the engineering teams from various counties. On the 15th, the people of eight villages including Dingma Di presented a fat pig, a cart of eggplants, twenty watermelons, and two packs of cigarettes. Villages such as Gao Village and Wang Street also brought gifts to offer comfort. Representatives from villages such as Zhang Village and Longwang Temple said with great gratitude: "If it weren't for your strenuous repairs this year, the river mouth would have breached long ago, and our lives would be uncertain. Now we can live peacefully at home, which is thanks to your efforts. The villagers asked us to send these small gifts to express our gratitude." They cursed Chiang's planes for bombing and sabotage, saying: "It would be fine if he (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) didn't manage the river, but he shouldn't send planes every day to harass us! These harmful, damned things." The Dongming Fourth District Office and the Dongming County Government also went to the dangerous work site on the 17th to offer comfort.

　　东明沿河群众慰劳抢险员工
    【冀鲁豫电】东明四区群众目睹各县工程队冒蒋机轰炸扫射的危险与大雨淋漓的艰难，奋不顾身，日夜抢修黄河险工，保障了他们身家性命的安全，衷心感激，纷纷送烟送猪，慰劳各县工程队。十五日，丁马第等八个村群众慰劳肥猪一口，茄子一车，西瓜二十个，纸烟两条。高村集、王街等村也纷纷携带慰劳品前去慰劳。张庄、龙王庙等村慰劳代表们非常感激的说：“今年要不是您们奋力抢修，河口早开了，我们的命也说不定怎样了，现在我们能在家安安稳稳的过日子，这是你们的功劳，乡亲们要我们送这点东西，也无非表表心意。”他们诅咒蒋机的轰炸破坏，说：“他（指蒋匪）不治河也就罢了，不该再派飞机天天来扰害呀！这些害人的、该死的东西。”东明四区区公所及东明县府，也于十七日到险工处去慰劳。
