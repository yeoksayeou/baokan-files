　　Taihang Postal Administration Postman
  　Liu Naizhu and Others Depart in the Rain
    [Taihang News] Comrade Liu Naizhu, a postal worker in the mailing department of the Taihang Postal Administration, saw that a section of a railway had been destroyed by rain and would take several days to repair. On the morning of the 19th of last month, it was still raining, and he said, "Even though it's forty-five *li* to Yancheng, we absolutely cannot delay the Party newspaper." He borrowed a carrying pole and rope, tied up the mail, and carried the load of more than seventy *jin*, heading straight for Yancheng. The rain got heavier, and although the mail was covered with rain cloth, the weight continued to increase. His shoes were torn, he was soaked to the skin, and he was hungry. He thought of eating something in Yetao, but when he got to Yetao, there was nothing to eat, so he continued to walk to Menghu on an empty stomach. Because the carrying pole rubbed his skin raw when he switched shoulders, the pain was unbearable, and he could no longer continue (eight *li* from Yancheng), so he left the mail in Menghu and went to Yancheng himself, arriving at seven o'clock. Postal workers Zhao Xiaosan and Liu Dacheng heard that the mail was still in Menghu, so they took the initiative to go and get it. The rain had subsided a bit, but it was very difficult to walk the rainy road in the dark. They arrived at Menghu, tied the mail to their backs, felt the rails with their hands, and walked on the sleepers with their feet, finally feeling their way back in the middle of the night, ensuring that the delivery on the 20th was not delayed.
    The next morning, the rain was still falling non-stop. Postal worker Jin Xi said, "Regardless of whether it rains or not, we absolutely cannot stop the mail." He harnessed a large cart and headed to She County. Passing through Jimingpu, the rain became heavier, and the villagers asked him to take shelter from the rain, but he continued to drive the cart forward in the heavy rain. When he arrived at Beiguan in She County, he met postal workers Shi Jinsheng and Xu Shuyou, who were barefoot, driving two large carts pulled by five mules, returning in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, the livestock fell into a mud pit, so they had to unload the cart and load the mail onto the mules to get to She County. It rained for five days, but the mail to She County never stopped.

　　太行邮管局邮务员
  　刘乃珠等雨天出发
    【太行讯】太行邮政管理局邮寄部邮务员刘乃珠同志，看到某铁路被雨冲毁了一段，几天才能修好。上月十九号早上雨还在下着，他说：“徘徊到岩城四十五里，无论如何不能停误了党报”，他借上扁担、绳子捆起邮件来，担起七十多斤的担子，一直往岩城就走。雨更大了，邮件虽然盖了雨布，重量却仍继续增加。鞋子已破，混身透湿，肚子饿了，想到冶陶吃点东西，到了冶陶，连个卖吃的也没有，又饿着肚皮走到猛虎，因为扁担换肩把皮肤弄破，疼痛难忍，再也不能坚持（离岩城八里），才把邮件寄在猛虎，自己到岩城去，到岩城时已七点钟了。邮工赵小三、刘大成二同志，听说邮件还在猛虎，他俩就主动去拿，这时雨小了些，但在黑夜走雨路，非常困难。到了猛虎把邮件捆在背上，两手摸着铁轨，两脚走着道木，半夜三更才摸回来，还不误二十号分发。
    第二天早上，雨仍然下的不停，邮工金喜同志说：“不管下不下，反正不能停了邮件”，套上大车到涉县。经过鸡鸣铺，雨下的更大，老乡让他避雨，他仍一直在大雨中赶着大车前进。走到涉县北关，碰见邮工史金生、许书耀二同志，赤着脚赶着五个骡子拉的两辆大车正往回返。不幸牲口跌在泥坑，只好卸下车，骡驮上邮件到了涉县。下雨五天，到涉县的邮件始终没有停过。
