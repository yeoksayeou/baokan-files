Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th. The local armed forces of the Anhui-West Liberated Army repelled several routes of attack by Xia Wei's bandit troops, the commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang, thwarting the enemy's attempt to destroy our Anhui-West and Anhui-Central governing power and to seize able-bodied men and grain by force. The enemy forces organized by Xia Wei in various places launched attacks on Maotanchang, located between Tongcheng, Shucheng, Huoshan, and Yuexi, and Yanjiaqiao and Shengjiaqiao, west of Wuwei, on July 10th. In addition to using a portion of our local armed forces and powerful guerrilla units to attack and harass the invading enemy everywhere, our main force launched attacks on the enemy's strongholds in Yuexi, Huoshan, Lu'an, Tongcheng, and other places, and eliminated the armed forces of three Kuomintang township offices east of Yuexi, capturing more than 100 enemy guns. The enemy forces, suffering attacks on both inner and outer lines, were completely routed. This anti-sweeping operation lasted for a week and ended in victory.
