Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th. The Sixth National Labor Congress has sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and the CPC Central Committee. The original telegram is as follows:

    The Sixth National Labor Congress solemnly opened in Harbin, the capital of the Northeast Liberated Area, on August 1st. On behalf of the national workers, we extend our highest respects to you—Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China! Because the Chinese working class has been led by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, it has been able, in the great struggle for its own liberation and for national liberation, in the nearly thirty years of arduous and tenacious long-term struggle, not to be misled by temporary darkness, not to be dizzy with temporary victories, and to display the supreme spirit of heroism, sacrifice, and wisdom, leading the people of the whole country to defeat all ferocious, tyrannical, dark, and reactionary enemies at home and abroad, destroy the feudal rule of the Northern Warlords, overthrow the ferocious Japanese imperialism, and in the past two years, smash the attacks of the Kuomintang reactionary army, which is even more ferocious and tyrannical than all previous reactionary forces and aided by American imperialism. The People's Liberation Army has launched a powerful offensive throughout the country, causing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang to move towards its final days of collapse and destruction, and making the days of liberation and victory for the workers and people of the whole country even closer. This great victory has further encouraged our courage and strengthened our confidence. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the genius strategist of Marxism, our national workers and all the people will not only be able to quickly get rid of the enslavement and oppression of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary forces, but will also be able to victoriously build a new democratic New China of freedom, democracy, prosperity, and strength. Our congress will certainly follow your instructions, study the principles and strategies for realizing the current tasks of the Chinese working class, and make this congress a congress of unity, victory, and progress. And we call on the national workers to unite around the Communist Party, unite under the banner of Chairman Mao, unite with the national democratic classes, support the People's Liberation War, in order to achieve the victory of quickly overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and realizing the liberation of the people of the whole country and the unification of the whole of China!
                The Presidium and All Representatives of the Sixth National Labor Congress
                August 1st
