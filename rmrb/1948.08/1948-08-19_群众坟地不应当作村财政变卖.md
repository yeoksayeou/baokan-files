　　Mass Burial Grounds Should Not Be Sold as Village Finances
    To the Editorial Department:
    I am from Muzuo Village, Seventh District, Wu'an County. I have a question that I would like answered regarding how it should be handled.
    In 1944, the government called for land reclamation. The village militia opened up an old grave belonging to my Yang family and cultivated it into land, approximately four mu in size. For the sake of production, this was understandable. However, last summer, when the government was reorganizing village finances and selling public property, the village cadres, without consultation, sold the land that the militia had reclaimed from our grave (there were also cypress trees inside the grave). This grave is neither public land nor is it ownerless or uncared for. Is it right that it was sold for no reason? Please advise.

    Answer: It is wrong for village cadres to sell someone else's grave at will when clearing up village finances. It should be returned to the original owner in consultation with the Farmers' Association.

### 群众坟地不应当作村财政变卖

　　群众坟地不应当作村财政变卖
    编辑同志：
    我是武安县七区木作村人，有一个问题，请解答一下，该如何处理才好。
    一九四四年政府号召开荒，村上民兵把俺杨姓一个老坟开了种成地，大约有四亩多，为了生产，当然没有什么。但去年夏天，政府整理村财政，卖公产，村上干部也没有商量，就把俺坟里民兵开成的地给出卖了（坟里边还有柏树），俺这坟地既非公地，又不是绝户无人管的，这样无故卖了，是不是该呢？请解答一下。

    答：村干部在清理村财政时，随便把别人坟地卖掉是不对的。应商同农会退还原主。
