　　Mobilizing Broad Masses of Women to Work in the Fields
　　Yu She Employs Over 4,000 Women to Harvest Wheat and Transplant Seedlings, Replacing Men
　　[Taihang Electric] During the recent Jinzhong Campaign, Yu She mobilized and organized over 4,400 women in the rear to work in the fields, resolving the labor shortage after a large number of men joined the war effort, thus ensuring the timely completion of agricultural production tasks such as seedling transplantation and wheat harvesting on over 300,000 mu of land in the county. For over a month, the county averaged a daily mobilization of civilian laborers accounting for 33% of the entire male labor force. With the wheat ripening and seedlings needing transplanting, the county leadership mobilized and organized a large number of women to undertake the task of rear-area production. Of the county's over 30,000 women, approximately 6,000 were young and middle-aged with labor capacity. This time, 4,465 were mobilized and organized to work in the fields, accounting for 75%. They voluntarily organized 686 temporary mutual aid teams. When harvesting wheat and transplanting seedlings, generally three female laborers were equivalent to two male laborers, totaling nearly 3,000 male laborers, which roughly made up for the labor shortage caused by the men joining the war. This summer, one-third of the wheat harvesting, seedling transplantation, and other tasks were completed by the women mobilized and organized throughout the county, along with some children and the elderly. What is particularly noteworthy in achieving this success is the leading and organizational role played by many female Communist Party members, female cadres, and female heroes and models in the movement. Hao Er-man, a female Party member from Tao Yang Village, is a famous female labor hero in the Taihang area. She and female Party member Chen Yue-ying mobilized all 119 young and middle-aged women in the village who could work in the fields, transplanting over 880 mu of rice seedlings and harvesting over 300 mu of wheat in half a month. They also educated and reformed four lazy women, harmonizing their families and enabling them to fully participate in production. Pei Zi-ying, a female Party member from Bai Village, fearing that people would not believe that women could work in the fields, took the lead in organizing a team, using practical achievements to influence everyone and promote the organization of all the women in the village to work in the fields. Others, such as Gong Gui-xiang, a female Party member from Tan Village, also organized women to work in the fields, playing a true exemplary role and greatly training themselves. The reason for such great achievements this time is that the county convened an enlarged meeting of district and village cadres in advance, enabling the female cadres to truly understand our policies and play a conscious leading role upon returning to their villages. In addition, the county earnestly corrected deviations, boosting the production enthusiasm of the masses. Furthermore, leaders at all levels patiently coordinated labor within the mutual aid organizations and implemented correct mutual aid policies, drawing labor from existing mutual aid teams to participate in the war, while leaving a few full laborers as the backbone of each team, mobilizing all the women, children, and elderly in the team to participate in labor, thus still maintaining a production level equivalent to the original team. In addition, the temporary mutual aid teams organized solely by women also played a significant role. In terms of work point calculation, the unfair phenomenon of uniformly calculating women as half laborers was corrected, and a method of evaluating work based on performance was established, increasing the enthusiasm of women for labor. The method of work point calculation in the front and rear was: unified work point calculation in the front and rear, and unified accounting after the war. This also greatly stimulated women's production enthusiasm. In addition to undertaking sewing and logistical tasks, women also did not neglect their normal duties because they could earn work points for their families' men by doing more work.

　　发动广大妇女下地劳动
  　榆社四千余妇女收麦拔苗顶男人
    【太行电】榆社在此次晋中战役中，后方发动与组织了四千四百余妇女上地，解决了大批男人参战后的劳力困难，使全县三十多万亩的拔苗及麦收等农业生产工作得以及时完成。月余来该县每天平均要出民工占整个男劳力的百分之三十三。当时麦黄苗大，县领导上便把广大妇女大量的动员组织起来，担负了完成后方生产的任务。全县三万余妇女中有劳力的青壮年约占六千余人，这次动员组织起来上地劳动的有四千四百六十五个，占百分之七十五。他们自愿组织了六百八十六个临时互助组，在割麦拔苗时一般是三个女劳力折两个男劳力，共可折男劳力将近三千，这样就大致补足了参战走了的男劳力所缺的工。今夏收麦拔苗等工作，有三分之一是全县动员组织起来的妇女再加上一部分儿童老汉来干的。在取得这样成绩中值得特别介绍的是许多女共产党员、女干部、女英雄模范，她们在运动中发挥了领导带头的组织作用。桃阳村女党员郝二蛮是太行区著名的女劳动英雄，她和女党员陈月英发动了全村能上地的一百一十九个青壮年妇女，半月内拔谷苗八百八十余亩，割麦三百多亩，并教育改造了四个懒惰的妇女，使他们的家庭和睦，全力参加了生产。白村女党员裴自英怕人不相信女人能上地，自己首先组织了一组，以实际成绩影响大家，推动组织了全村妇女上地。还有其他如谭村女党员巩桂香等都组织了妇女上地，起了真正的模范作用，并大大锻炼了她们自己。这次的成绩所以这样大，是因为预先就由县召开了区村干部扩大会，使妇女干部真正了解了我们的政策，回村发生了自觉的领导作用，加以该县认真纠正偏向，群众生产情绪提高。此外，各级领导上在互助组织中很耐心的调剂了劳力，执行了正确的互助政策，以原有互助组抽出劳力去参战，每个组留下几个全劳力作骨干，发动全组所有妇女儿童老汉参加劳动，这样仍能保持相当于原来组的生产力水平。另外，妇女单独组织的临时互助组作用也大。计工方面改正了凡女人一律按半劳力计工的不公平现象，确定了以活评工的办法，提高了妇女劳动热忱，前后方的记工办法是：前后方统一记工，参战完后，前后方统一算帐。这也大大刺激了妇女生产情绪，妇女除担负缝纫勤务外，还不误服平常差务，因为他们多做活，赚下工可给自己家庭的男人顶工。
