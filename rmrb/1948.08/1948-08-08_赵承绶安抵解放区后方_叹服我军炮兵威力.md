    Zhao Chengzhou Safely Arrives in Liberated Area Rear
    Admires Our Army's Artillery Power
    [Jinzhong Front, 4th dispatch] Zhao Chengzhou, the Kuomintang bandit Lieutenant General of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Shanxi Field Army, captured in the Jinzhong Campaign, has safely arrived in a rear area of the Liberated Zone. Zhao told reporters: He still has lingering fear of the intense artillery fire and vigorous attacking spirit of the People's Liberation Army when it encircled and annihilated his army group. Zhao said, "The PLA's artillery fire, especially the heavy artillery, simply bombarded us (Yan's army) so that we couldn't even lift our heads. This was completely beyond our expectations." Zhao claimed that Gao Bin, the former Major General and artillery commander of Yan's army, Yang Qifeng, the commander of the Provisional 44th Division, Han Chunsheng, the commander of the 71st Division, and Yuan Quanfu, the Japanese deputy commander-in-chief of his field army, were all killed by the PLA's accurate artillery fire. Zhao darkly lamented the demoralization of his troops. He said, "The relations between our (Yan's side) officers and soldiers all relied on personal feelings to maintain. Once there were casualties among the cadres, the troops would fall apart."

    赵承绶安抵解放区后方
    叹服我军炮兵威力
    【晋中前线四日电】此次晋中战役被俘之阎匪太原绥署中将副主任兼山西野战军总司令赵承绶，已安抵解放区后方某地。赵向记者表示：渠对解放军围歼其集团军时，炽烈的炮火和旺盛的攻击精神，至今犹有余悸。赵说：“解放军的炮火，特别是重炮，简直把我们（阎军）轰击得连头也抬不起来，这点却完全出乎我们预料之外。”赵称：原阎军少将炮兵指挥处长高斌、暂编四十四师师长杨栖凤、七十一师师长韩春生，及其野战军副总司令日人元全福等不少高级指挥官，均被解放军准确之炮火所击毙。赵对其部队士气之颓丧暗然慨叹。他说：“我们（阎方）官兵之间，全靠私人感情拉拢来维系的，干部一有伤亡，部队即趋瓦解。”
