Xinhua News Agency, East China, August 13th: American troops stationed in Qingdao are once again committing atrocities in the city. According to the Qingdao Military and Civilian Daily, on July 25th, American troops committed three acts of violence in a single day. At 8:00 PM that afternoon, merchant Wang Quanpu was crossing the Nan Hai Bridge when he was suddenly pushed off the bridge by a drunken American sailor, breaking his right leg in the fall. At the same time, a Mr. Qiu was hit by an American soldier on a bicycle on Yushan Road, injuring his leg. At 10:00 PM, Yang Huafeng and his two sons, residents of Nan Hai Road, were beaten when they tried to stop American soldiers from unreasonably damaging their home.

Another report from the joint edition of the July 11th Pingmin Bao and Damin Bao states that there have been 175 traffic accidents in Qingdao in the past six months, resulting in 168 casualties among the citizens. The majority of these accidents were caused by American military vehicles speeding and driving recklessly.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, August 9th: The livelihoods of Qingdao fishermen are being repeatedly devastated by the U.S. Marine Corps. According to the July 22nd Qingdao "Minyan Bao," in early July, the U.S. Navy in Qingdao conducted landing exercises in the coastal fishing villages of Shazikou, Jianggezhuang, and Shilaoren, damaging more than 200 fishing nets, more than 7,000 fishing rods, and more than 10,000 catties of rope, resulting in a total loss of over 200 billion National Currency. The Fishery Association has already sent letters to the Kuomintang Police Bureau and Social Bureau, respectively, requesting negotiations with the U.S. Navy authorities for compensation. However, the Kuomintang traitorous government not only ignores this but also makes all sorts of excuses to defend its American masters. The heads of the puppet social bureaus in various cities even shamelessly said, "This kind of thing often happens in Nanjing, so it's nothing." The fishermen are extremely angry about this.

　　青岛美军暴行迭出
    商人王某过桥竟被推落桥下海军演习登陆摧残渔民生计
    【新华社华东十三日电】盘踞青岛美军又在青市演出暴行。据该市军民日报披露：七月二十五日一日内，美军即三度行凶。是日下午八时，南海桥商人王全普有经桥上时，突被一醉酒美海军推落桥下，右腿摔伤。与此同时，一邱姓行人在鱼山路被美军自行车撞倒，腿部受伤。晚十时，南海路住户杨华峰父子三人在阻止美军无理毁坏其住宅时，横遭殴伤。
    另据七月十一日平民报、大民报联合版消息：半年来青岛交通肇事达一七五次，死伤市民一六八人，其中以美军用车超速度横闯直撞肇事最多。
    【新华社华东九日电】青岛渔民生计迭遭美海军陆战队摧残。据七月二十二日青岛“民言报”透露：七月上旬青岛美海军又在沙子口、蒋格庄、石老人等沿海一带渔村演习登陆，损坏渔民渔网二百余张，渔竿七千余条，绳一万余斤，损失总值达国民党币二千余亿元。渔业公会已为此分别函请国民党警察局及社会局向美海军当局交涉赔偿，而国民党卖国政府非但置之不理，反以种种借口强为其美国主子辩护，各市伪社会局长甚至厚颜无耻地说：“这种事情在南京亦时常发生，算不得什么。”渔民对此愤慨异常。
