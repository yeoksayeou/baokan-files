    Develop Production to Support the War
    Light Industrial and Commercial Taxes, High Profits
    North China Industrial and Commercial Conference Determines Burden Methods
    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China Liberated Area Industrial and Commercial Conference held enthusiastic discussions on the issue of industrial and commercial burdens. The conference clarified that the basic spirit of industrial and commercial burden policies should be to not hinder the development of industry and commerce, and, under this premise, to strive for income to support the war. The conference criticized the one-sided view of financial tasks in many areas in the past, as well as the resulting chaotic burden system, excessively broad burden scope, and even the erroneous phenomenon of restoring similar harsh and miscellaneous levies in some areas. The conference believes that in order to develop production, make up for the long-term damage to industry and commerce by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the damage to industry and commerce caused by deviations in the implementation of policies in various regions, it is determined that for areas that have suffered excessive losses in the future, tax payments for industrial and commercial households should be reduced or exempted; all handicraft and commercial operations that are of a household sideline production nature should be exempt from taxation. In order to encourage the development of industry and commerce beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, the collection should be differentiated according to different contributions to the war and the people's lives. General industrial taxes should be lighter than commercial taxes, and some industries may be reduced or exempted depending on their nature. Industrial and commercial income tax should adopt a progressive tax system in order to be fair and reasonable. However, the progressive rate should be low and gradual. The conference specifically stipulated that the threshold for income tax collection should be a net profit of 200,000 Jibi, the minimum tax rate should be 5% of net profit, and the maximum tax rate should not exceed 25% of net profit. The conference decided that in the future, all transactions that do not go through market brokers will not be subject to transaction tax. The license tax is limited to small urban vendors and rural vendors whose primary occupation is commerce; handicraft and commercial operations that are sideline production are exempt. Regarding the war support burden, which industrialists and merchants in various regions are very concerned about, the conference stipulated that in order to take care of the labor habits of industrialists and merchants and the operating methods of industry and commerce, they can apply to the government for exemption from labor burdens and instead pay war support fees. The amount and method of payment of war support fees will be uniformly stipulated by the government. The collection of industrial and commercial taxes in newly liberated cities should be based on local conditions, allocating a certain amount of collection, which will be assessed and collected by the Federation of Industry and Commerce through democratic discussion; the tax rate should be lighter than in the old areas.
    Regarding the payment time, some regions stipulated a one-time collection in the past in order to simplify procedures; however, some representatives reflected that this greatly affected the capital turnover of industrialists and merchants. The conference took into account the opinions of the representatives and, taking into account supporting the war, stipulated that it should be collected in two installments during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival each year, and after evaluation in the first month of the following year, any overpayment will be refunded and any underpayment will be made up. However, for industries and businesses with slow capital turnover, such as leather workshops and soy sauce shops, they can still apply to the government for approval to pay in one lump sum after evaluation in the first month. Regarding the evaluation method, some representatives believed that in the past, in order to pursue fair and reasonable evaluation, methods such as auditing accounts and inventory were adopted, which often resulted in excessively long time consumption and were inconsistent with the general operating habits of industrialists and merchants, affecting business. At the same time, in the past, citizens participated in the evaluation, but because they were not familiar with the situation of various industries, it was extremely difficult to express opinions, and it was easy to produce the malpractice of over-evaluation or under-evaluation, increasing the difficulty of evaluation. The conference accepted this opinion and determined that in the future, the evaluation committee should be mainly composed of the Federation of Industry and Commerce (i.e., the Chamber of Commerce), and impartial people from various industries should be invited to participate, and the evaluation should be carried out under the leadership of the government's Industry and Commerce Bureau. The method of self-reporting and public discussion will be adopted during the evaluation, and methods such as auditing accounts and inventory will generally not be used. If the taxpayer has any objections after the evaluation, they can submit reasons within three days and apply to the evaluation committee for reconsideration. The decision will be finalized after reconsideration.
    During the conference discussions, representatives of private industry and commerce spoke most enthusiastically and expressed satisfaction with the conference's regulations. It is generally believed that under the government's clear policy of protecting industry and commerce and the victorious development of the war, light industrial and commercial taxes and high profits will lead to greater and more rapid development.

    发展生产支援战争
    工商业税轻利大
    华北工商会议确定负担办法
    【本报讯】华北解放区工商业会议对工商业负担问题曾展开了热烈的讨论。会议明确指出了工商业负担政策的基本精神，应当是不妨碍工商业之发展，并在此前提下，争取收入，支援战争。大会批判了过去不少地区的片面财政任务观点，以及因而产生的负担制度纷乱、负担面过宽，甚至有的地区发生恢复类似苛杂的错误现象。会议认为：为了发展生产，弥补日寇及蒋匪对工商业的长期破坏，以及各地在执行政策中发生偏向而加予工商业的损害，确定今后对遭受损失过重的地区，工商户的税款应予减免；凡属家庭副业生产性质的手工业及商业经营一律免征。为奖励对国计民生有益的工商业发展，征收时应按对战争及人民生活不同的贡献而有所区别。一般的工业税应轻于商业税，有些工业并可按其性质予以减免。工商业所得税采取累进税制，以求公平合理。但累进率应低而缓。会议具体规定所得税的起征点为纯利冀币二十万元，最低税额为纯利的百分之五，最高税额不超过纯利的百分之二十五。会议决定：今后凡不经过市场经纪之交易，一律不征交易税。对于牌照税则规定仅限于城镇小商摊贩及农村之以商业为主要职业者之商贩；作为副业生产之手工业商业经营，一律免除。各地工商业者所十分关切的战勤负担，会议规定为照顾工商业者的劳动习惯及工商业的经营方式，可申请政府免除劳力负担，改织战勤费。战勤费数目及缴纳方法由政府统一规定。对新解放城市工商业税的征收，则根据当地情况，分配一定征收数目，由工商联合会按民主评议，摊派征收；税额应较老区轻。
    关于纳税时间，过去若干地区规定一次征收，原为简便手续；但有些代表反映影响工商业者的资金周转极大。会议当根据代表意见，并照顾支援战争，规定每年分于端午及中秋两节借征，至第二年正月评议后，多还少补。但对于资金周转迟缓之工商业如皮作坊、酱园等，仍可向政府呈准于正月评议后一次缴纳。对于评议方法，有些代表认为过去为追求评议公平合理，有采用查帐盘贷等方法者，往往流于时间过长，且与工商业者一般经营习惯不合，影响营业。同时过去市民参加评议，因对各行业情况不熟悉，极难发表意见，并常易产生评议过高或过低的流弊，增加评议困难。会议接受了这个意见，确定今后评议委员会以工商业联合会（即商会）为主，聘请各行业公正人士参加，在政府工商局领导下进行评议。评议时采取自报公议，一般不用查帐盘存等方法。评议后如纳税户有意见，可于三日内提出理由，呈请评议会复议。复议后即作定论。
    会议讨论中，私营工商业代表发言最为热烈，对会议的规定皆表满意。一般认为在政府明确的保护工商业政策及战争胜利发展的情况下，工商业税轻利大，将得到更大的更迅速的发展。
