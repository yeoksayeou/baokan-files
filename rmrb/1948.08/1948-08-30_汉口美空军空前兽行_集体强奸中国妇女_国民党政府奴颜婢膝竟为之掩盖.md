Xinhua News Agency, North China, August 28th - An appalling case of mass rape of dozens of Chinese women by U.S. Air Force personnel occurred in Hankou in early August. According to a Hankou dispatch in the Tianjin Yishibao on August 16th, the incident unfolded as follows: On the evening of August 8th, over 20 Chinese women (Reuters in Nanjing on August 16th reported over 40) were invited by Serafin, the acting Philippine diplomatic representative in Hankou, to a dance at the Philippine Consulate on the fifth floor of the Jingming Building on Shenyang Street. All those invited were Chinese women, with no male guests. During the dance, U.S. Air Force personnel suddenly closed the windows, turned off the lights, and engaged in collective rape. One singer managed to escape and reported to the police station. When the police arrived, the bestial acts were still in progress, but the police allowed all the U.S. Air Force rapists to escape with ease. Among the victims were the wives and daughters of Kuomintang military officers, the wife and concubines of Hankou National Party City Council Speaker Zhang Michuan and a certain administrative head, a female reporter named Yang from a certain newspaper, and the two younger sisters and mother of a certain famous soprano. Some were brutally gang-raped four times. According to the dispatch, this crime was meticulously planned by U.S. Air Force personnel and the Philippine acting representative Serafin over a month, with the involvement of individuals such as the Philippine musician Big Victor from the Jianghan Ballroom.

After this shocking act of violence was exposed by three newspapers in Hankou, it aroused outrage throughout the city. However, Hankou Mayor Xu Huizhi shamelessly told reporters, "This is something the Americans did, what can we do? It's better to make a big deal small, and a small deal disappear. You don't need to investigate further, there's no point in publishing this kind of news." Yuan Yong, chairman of the Kuomintang city party headquarters, said, "The news should stop here, because further investigation will only point to the U.S. Air Force." At the same time, the police station and the city government were ordered to refuse to provide reporters with details of this atrocity.

This kind of bestial act of trampling on Chinese women is the natural result of the Chiang Kai-shek government's implementation of a traitorous policy and its servile obsequiousness to American imperialism. American imperialism drives Kuomintang military officers to the front lines to sell their lives, while in the rear, they rape their wives and daughters. The Chiang Kai-shek government not only doesn't say a word against it but goes out of its way to cover it up, showing its utter servility.

　　汉口美空军空前兽行
  　集体强奸中国妇女
    国民党政府奴颜婢膝竟为之掩盖
    【新华社华北二十八日电】八月上旬汉口发生美国空军人员集体强奸中国妇女数十人的大兽行案。据八月十六日天津益世报汉口通讯报导经过如下：八月八日晚，中国妇女廿余人（合众社南京十六日电为四十余人）应菲律宾驻汉口外交代办塞拉芬邀请，前往沈阳街景明大楼五楼菲律宾领事馆参加舞会。被邀参加者全部为中国妇女而无男宾。舞会进行中，美空军人员突关闭窗户，熄灭电灯，实行集体强奸。其中一歌女逃出前往警局报告。警察抵达时，兽行仍在继续，但警察却让全部美空军强奸犯从容逃去。被强奸者中有国民党军官妻女多人，汉口国民党市议会议长张弥川和某行政首长的妻妾，某报女记者杨某，及某著名女高音的两个妹妹与母亲。其中有惨遭轮奸四次者。此一罪行，据该通讯指出：系由美空军人员与菲律宾驻汉代办塞拉芬事先周密计划经一个月时间筹备者，参与预谋者有江汉舞厅菲律宾乐手大比克多斯等。
    此一惊人的大暴行案为汉口三家报纸揭露后，全市人心激愤，而汉口市长徐会之竟对各报记者无耻声称：“这是美国人干的事，又有什么办法呢？不如大事化小，小事化无好。诸位也不必多去采访，登这类新闻是没有什么道理的。”国民党市党部主委袁雍说：“消息到此就不必再去追究了，因为再追下去便只有将美国空军指出来。”与此同时警局及市府且奉命拒绝以此一兽行详情供给各报记者。
    此种蹂躏中国妇女的兽行，乃蒋介石政府实行卖国政策、婢膝奴颜的奉侍美帝国主义的自然结果。美帝国主义驱使国民党军官到前线去卖命，而在后方则强奸他们的妻女。蒋介石政府对此不惟没说半个不字，反而尽力为之掩盖，奴相十足。
