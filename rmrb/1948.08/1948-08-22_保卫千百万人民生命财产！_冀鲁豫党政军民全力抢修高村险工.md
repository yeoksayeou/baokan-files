Xinhua News Agency, North China, 20th—The Gaocun dangerous section on the south bank of the Yellow River in Dongming is now in extreme danger. The Yellow River is only two meters away from the levee, and in some places, the water has reached the base of the levee, with depths of one to two zhang. During the period when the Kuomintang army occupied the dangerous section from July 20th to 31st, they built bunkers and dug fortifications on the dikes and dams. On the Gaocun south head levee alone, they dug more than 90 single-person shelters, and the communication trenches were crisscrossed. They also looted all the engineering materials stored there. After the enemy fled on the 31st of last month, the director of the Yellow River Committee of the Liberated Area and the county magistrate of Dongming County personally led the staff to the levee day and night to guide the residents in rescue operations. However, the engineering work was severely damaged, making rescue extremely difficult. Moreover, continuous heavy rains and rapid changes in the river's flow on the 9th, caused the four dams that we had been rushing to build and repair day and night to lose their effectiveness. In this emergency, the Yellow River Committee's flood control headquarters urgently transported 18 million catties of straw and 481 catties of willow trees to continue building four new dams downstream to shift the main flow. However, the major flood season is tight, and the Yellow River is extremely turbulent. The foundations of the new dams could not stand firm. By the morning of the 10th, all 17 new dams that had been built had collapsed into the water, and the Yellow River was connected to the base of the levee. On the 12th, the 18th dam also cracked one meter, in critical condition. Just as we were rushing to repair the levee, Kuomintang planes launched a series of frenzied attacks and strafing, totaling 12 times. They shot down one of our material transport boats, killed and wounded one civilian worker each, and many cattle and mules. The emergency rescue workers were dispersed. More than a hundred cadres on the levee braved the danger to transport more than 50,000 catties of straw and willow branches and personally carried out the rescue, and the crack was blocked after five hours. Currently, the Liberated Area Yellow River Committee and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office have decided to urgently transport straw support from Changyuan and Kunwu counties on the north bank. With the consent of local residents, they will cut down the sorghum stalks near the river to rush to build a 400-meter-long straw revetment to protect the levee. At the same time, the back of the levee is being thickened, and a large number of laborers are being mobilized to rush to repair the encirclement dike from Baidian to Houyangcun to prevent the levee from collapsing. At present, we have mobilized 1,750 carts and more than 20,000 laborers on both banks, braving Chiang's aircraft attacks, day and night, rushing to transport and repair.

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] The counties along the Yellow River are vigorously supporting the arduous flood control project in Gaocun. Before August, the materials supported by the north bank to the dangerous section included 500 cubic meters of stone, 1,977 stakes, 1,356 large hemp ropes (more than 20 catties each), 1,345 walnut ropes (12 catties each), 1,216 catties of hemp rope, 13,000 catties of iron wire, and 300,000 catties of willow. Recently, the dangerous section has fallen into an extremely critical state due to the destruction by Chiang bandits and the bombing by Chiang's aircraft. The counties on both the north and south banks have actively provided support. Changyuan County on the north bank sends 40 to 50 carts every day to rush to transport 2 million catties of straw, which is transported to the south bank by the ship transport team. The Administrative Office and the Yellow River Committee sent three cars, and Shou Zhang and Fanxian counties sent 180 carts to transport 200,000 catties of hemp ropes from more than 200 li away. Heze and Kaocheng counties on the south bank sent 900 carts to rush to transport bricks, willows, and straw. Nanhua County (newly established county, parts of Dongming and Heze) rushed to transport 800,000 catties of straw and 6,000 stakes. In order to save the critical situation of the Gaocun dangerous section, the Yellow River Committee has decided to transform the river's flow, digging a 4-li-long, 10-meter-wide, and 2-meter-deep diversion river from Qingzhuang East to the Northeast. Once the floodwater overflows the banks, it will be used to discharge water to reduce the impact of the main flow at the dangerous section, so that Gaocun can escape danger. It is estimated that this diversion river requires more than 40,000 cubic meters of work. This project has been undertaken by 6,000 laborers from Kunwu and Puyang counties, and construction began on the 13th, and it is estimated that it may be completed in five days.

Also: The Party, government, army, and people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are making great efforts to rescue the Gaocun dangerous section. In addition to the entire cadres of the First and Second Repair and Prevention Offices of the Yellow River Committee, the Dongming Repair and Prevention Section, the Dongming County, the River Defense First Brigade, Commissioner Guo of the Fifth Special District, and the engineering teams of the five sections, a unit of the People's Liberation Army is also protecting the rescue. On August 11, Political Commissar Cui of the unit personally inspected the river levee and rescue project at the dangerous section, and discussed with Commissioner Guo and others on the method of the troops participating in the rescue. On the 12th, after the Jiang bandits attacked seven times (one more attack after the previous report of six times), our rescue was forced to delay work for five hours. When the situation below the Sixteenth Dam was critical, the unit immediately supervised the laborers in nearby villages to work. After dark on the 13th, a team from the unit braved the rain to participate in carrying sorghum stalks and willow branches, working all night until dawn. On the 11th, County Magistrate Zhu of Nanhua County rushed to the dangerous section and the rescue headquarters to discuss the support method for the laborers of Nanhua County. On the 13th, Vice Secretary Huo Kunyu of the Fifth Prefectural Committee and Commander Wang Ziping of the Fifth Special District Garrison also rushed to the dangerous section to lead the laborers of the Fifth Military Sub-district to carry out rescue work. Vice Director Han of the Administrative Office also rushed to the river in the rain at dusk on the 13th to uniformly lead the rescue. To defend the lives and property of the people, we are determined to fight against natural disasters and the Yellow River calamity.

  　冀鲁豫党政军民全力抢修高村险工
    【新华社华北二十日电】黄河南岸东明高村险工，现已危殆万分。现黄水距大堤仅两公尺，有的地方水已到大堤根，深一丈至两丈。国民党军七月二十日至三十一日侵占该险工期间，曾在堤、坝上修筑碉堡，挖掘工事，仅高村南头大堤上面挖了单人掩护达九十多个，交通沟纵横皆是，并将保存放该处之工料抢掠一空。上月三十一日敌窜逃后，本月一日解放区黄委会主任、东明县县长等即亲率员工上堤领导居民日夜抢救，但工程工作毁的巨大，抢到极为困难；而连日暴雨，九日河势急变，大溜下移，更使我日夜赶筑及整修之四个坝失去作用。我黄委会抢险指挥部在此紧急情况下，急赶运秸子一千八百万斤，柳树四百八十一斤，继续往下移大溜处添筑四道新坝。但大汛正紧，黄水汹涌异常，新坝基站立不住，十日晨，十七个所筑新的已全部坍塌下水，黄水接着堤根。十二日十八坝亦裂缝一公尺，状极危殆。但正值我紧急抢险时，国民党飞机竟连续疯狂袭击扫射先后共达十二次之多，当击毁我运料船一艘，打死打伤民工各一人，及牛骡甚多，紧急抢险民工皆被驱散。堤上干部百余人，乃奋不顾身搬运秸料柳枝五万余斤，亲自动手抢险，经五小时始将裂缝堵住。现解放区黄委会与冀鲁豫行署除决定从北岸长垣及昆吾两县急运秸料支援外，并商得当地居民同意，将沿河附近青高粱杆砍倒，以赶修四百余公尺长之秸料护沿，以保护大堤。同时在该段堤背则进行培厚工作，并调集大批民工，突击补修白店至后杨村之圈堤，以防大堤不保。现我已在两岸动员了一千七百五十辆大车和两万多民工，冒蒋机袭击，日夜抢运抢修中。
    【冀鲁豫电】黄河沿岸各县，大力支援高村艰巨的抢险工程。八月份以前，北岸支援该险工的工料即有五百方石，一千九百七十七根桩，一千三百五十六条大麻绠（每条二十余斤）一千三百四十五条核桃绳（每条十二斤），麻绳一千二百一十六斤，铁丝一万三千斤，柳三十万斤。最近该险工由于被蒋匪的破坏与蒋机的轰炸，陷于极端危急状态，南北两岸各县即积极进行了支援，北岸长垣县，每天出大车四五十辆，抢运二百万斤秸料，运至河边后，再由船运大队运到南岸。行署和黄委会出汽车三辆，寿张和范县出大车一百八十辆，从二百余里外赶运二十万斤麻绠。南岸的菏泽考城等县，出大车九百辆，抢运砖、柳和秸料。南华县（新设县，东明、菏泽各一部）抢运八十万斤秸料和六千根桩。黄委会为了挽救高村险工危急形势，特决定改造河势，从青庄东往东北挖一道四华里长、十公尺宽、二公尺深的引河，一旦大水出槽漫滩时，用以泄水，以减轻险工处大溜的冲击，使高村脱险。预计此引河需工四万余方，这一工程已由昆吾和濮阳两县的六千名民工担任，并已于十三日开工，估计五天可能完工。
    又电：冀鲁豫区的党政军民，正用大力抢救高村险工中，除了黄委会第一、二修防处东明修防段东明县的全体干部、河防第一大队、五专区郭专员等和五个段的工程队参加外，并有人民解放军某部掩护抢险。八月十一日，该部崔政委，亲自到险工视察河堤及抢险工程，并与郭专员等商定部队参加抢险办法，十二日经蒋匪机袭扰七次（前报导六次之后又来袭一次）我抢险被迫误工五小时，十六坝以下告急时，该部队即在附近村督促民工做工，十三日天黑后，并有该部一个队冒雨到险工参加扛秫秸和柳枝，工作整夜直到天明。十一日南华县朱县长赶到险工和抢险指挥部，商定了南华县民工的支援的办法。十三日，五地委副书记霍昆玉同志和五专署兵站司令王子平，也赶到险工，领导五分区民工进行抢险工作，行署韩副主任，十三日天黑时，也冒雨赶到河来，统一领导抢险。为保卫人民生命财产，坚决与天灾黄患作斗争。
