Xinhua News Agency, North China, 14th -- The Yellow River situation is extremely critical as the high-water season is upon us. The most critical points are the two major dangerous works, Caogang and Guantai, in the southern part of Changyuan on the north bank, and the 300-plus *li* of dikes on the south bank between Dongming and the west of Dongping Lake. Among them, the Gaocun dangerous work was reported to be the most serious as of the 10th.

　　This section of the south bank includes four major dangerous works: Linpu, Gaocun, Zhukou, and Liuzhuang, as well as over 72 dangerous works including the ＠Shan dangerous work. Construction began in early April at the same time as the dike reinforcement project on the north bank from Dacheji in Changyuan to Suozhuang in Qihe, a total length of more than 600 *li*. The north bank dike was completed in mid-May, but the south bank dike suffered decisive damage due to the destruction and incursions of the Kuomintang army. According to incomplete statistics since February of this year, the four major dangerous works alone have suffered 12 major destructions, with eight dams continuously collapsing into the water, posing extreme danger to the dikes. According to extremely incomplete statistics, since the beginning of this year, the dangerous works on the south bank have lost a total of more than 2.19 million *jin* of straw materials and more than 20,000 *jin* of hemp. Gaocun alone lost more than 3,000 *jin* of iron wire. The Jiangsu Dam at Linpu dangerous work lost 8,150 rows of ice raft pilings, more than 18,000 wooden pilings, and 960 ropes for the rope-making yard. Kuomintang aircraft frequently harassed the families of the workers, with repeated bombing and strafing of the Gaocun dangerous work reaching as many as 13 times in a single day. In total, we have suffered 288 casualties among the dike repair workers this year. The Nationalist army's Whole 5th Division, 55th Division, and 68th Division, which recently occupied this section of the dike on July 31, were forced to move south. Our democratic government and the Yellow River Committee of the Liberated Area immediately supervised the repair departments to urgently resume the rush repair work. The county magistrate of Dongming County and others gathered dike repair workers overnight and rushed to the south bank to resume work. The Yellow River Committee also led the local people to transport materials day and night. The Juancheng repair department is transporting 600 cubic meters of stone and 800,000 *jin* of straw from the north bank, and mobilizing the people of Yuncheng, Juancheng, and other counties to contribute 2,500 cubic meters of stone and 500,000 *jin* of straw from Yunbei (new county, north of Yuncheng). However, according to the person in charge of the local Yellow River Committee, due to the serious destruction and occupation by the Kuomintang bandit army, the dike repair time has been delayed for as long as three months. Now that the high-water season is upon us, we are mobilizing all forces in the hope of overcoming the disaster created by the Kuomintang.

　　The Guantai dangerous work in the southern part of Changyuan on the north bank is the starting point of the Guanmeng dike. The Caogang dangerous work is the largest dangerous work in Henan Province, with a total length of 12 *li* and 44 large and small stone dams. The water surface is 11 meters above the ground, while the dike is only 5 meters above the water surface, forming a "suspended river". Since the 40th Division and 106th Brigade of the Kuomintang and the bandit Wang Sanzhu's troops occupied Changyuan County on July 15, our 5,000 rush-repair workers in that section of the repair department had to retreat, and the complete repair project of Caogang and Guantai was forced to stop. Now these two places may be in danger at any time. The northern section of the Guanmeng dike, which we completed at the end of May, is also under great threat.

　　蒋匪肆意破坏耽误抢修
  　黄河情势十分危急
    我正动员一切力量抢救蒋造灾难
    【新华社华北十四日电】目前大汛正紧，黄河情势十分危急。现在最危急之处，一为北岸长垣南部曹岗、贯台两大险工，一为南岸东明至东平湖西之间的三百余里堤段。其中高村险工据十日消息最为严重。
    南岸此段河堤计有临濮、高村、朱口、刘庄等四大险工及＠山险工等险工共七十二处，四月初北岸自长垣大车集至齐河索庄，全长六百余里的河堤增修工程动工时，即已同时动工。北岸大堤已于五月中旬修竣，南岸大堤则因国民党军之破坏侵袭，致使工程遭受了决定性的损害。据今年二月以来不完全统计，仅四大险工即前后遭受了十二次重要破坏，有八个坝曾经继续坍塌下水，黄水直扑大堤，危险已极。据极不完全统计，今年以来，南岸各险工共损失秸料二百一十九万余斤，大麻两万余斤。仅高村一处即损失铁丝三千余斤。临濮险工之江苏坝即损失凌排桩八千一百五十排，木桩一万八千余根，绳索场绠九百六十条。国民党飞机之袭扰家属频繁，其对高村险工之轮番轰炸扫射，一日之内曾达十三次之多。总计今年以来，我共死伤修堤员工二百八十八人。七月三十一日最近一次侵占此段堤岸之国民党军整五师、五十五师、六十八师等部被迫南调。我民主政府及解放区黄委会当即督饬各修防处紧急恢复抢修工作。东明县县长等星夜集合修防员工，赶渡南岸复工。黄委会并领导当地人民日夜补运工料。鄄城修防处正由北岸赶运石料六百方及秸料八十万斤，并动员郓城、鄄城等县人民献石二千五百方，郓北（新县，郓城北）运秸料五十万斤。但据当地黄委会负责人称：由于国民党匪军之严重破坏侵踞，已耽误修堤时间达三月之久，现大汛已紧，我正动员一切力量以期能战胜国民党所造成的灾难。
    北岸长垣南部贯台险工为贯孟大堤之起点。曹岗险工为豫省第一大险工，全长十二里，有大小石坝四十四道。水面高出地面十一公尺，而大堤仅高出水面五公尺，形成悬河之势。自七月十五日国民党四十师一零六旅及土匪王三祝部侵占长垣县城后，我该段修防处五千抢修民工，不得不后撤，曹岗、贯台之整险工程遂被迫停止。现该两处随时可能出险。五月底才为我修竣之贯孟大堤北段亦已受极大威胁。
