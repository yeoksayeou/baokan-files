　　According to the Principle of Developing Production to Support the War
　　Shijiazhuang City Democratically Assesses and Levies Industrial and Commercial Taxes
    [Shijiazhuang News] Shijiazhuang City’s industrial and commercial taxes for January to June of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948) will soon be levied. In accordance with the spirit of the North China Industrial and Commercial Conference's resolution, Shijiazhuang has established provisional measures for the fixed-amount tax system for industry and commerce, based on the principle of developing production and supporting the war. It stipulates that state-owned enterprises such as military industries and railway transportation, state banks that do not aim to make profits, cultural and public welfare undertakings, promotion societies that support mass production, and cooperatives that serve the masses and have been examined and approved by the government, machine manufacturing, rural household sideline occupations, tax-exempt businesses that have been clearly stipulated by the government, and special inventions and creations that have been approved by the government for awards are exempt from taxation. All other public and private industrial and commercial enterprises that aim to make profits are subject to taxation. However, all income from operations before January 1 of this year is exempt, and businesses newly opened in June are exempt from taxation. The municipal government stipulates that the fixed tax amount for the first half of the year is 15,000 shi of millet (320 jin per shi). The minimum tax amount per household is 5% of the net profit, and the maximum shall not exceed 25%. As for real estate, utensils, leasing, film and theater industries, merchants, underground casinos, peddlers, temporary businesses, and other profitable income, separate single-item tax laws will be formulated for collection. The method of bearing the burden is to collect taxes through the joint industrial and commercial association, with the method of apportioning among various industries under democratic evaluation. According to the principle of favoring production development with industry lighter than commerce, grades are divided, and each industry, group, and household self-reports, publicly discusses, and democratically deliberates. The tax amount to be borne by each industry, group, and household determined according to the fixed tax amount is the tax payable, striving for fair and reasonable burden. In terms of organizational leadership, a municipal-level industrial and commercial tax collection committee is organized as the leading organ for the collection work, and a municipal industrial and commercial tax evaluation and allocation committee is organized to be responsible for the implementation of all evaluation work. Industrial and commercial tax evaluation and allocation sub-committees are organized by industry to be responsible for the evaluation, collection, and allocation work of each industry. Public industrial and commercial enterprises form a separate evaluation and allocation sub-committee to be responsible for the evaluation and allocation work of public industrial and commercial enterprises.
