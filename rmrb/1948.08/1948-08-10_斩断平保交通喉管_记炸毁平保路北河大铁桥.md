    Severing the Pingbao Transportation Artery
    A Record of Blowing Up the North River Great Iron Bridge on the Pingbao Road
    "Losing Dingcheng is preferable to losing the North River Bridge; without the North River Bridge, there is no Baoding." This was the warning given by the Kuomintang bandit Huaibei Deputy Commander Song Kentang when he personally came to the North River Bridge to lecture the defending troops. Indeed, the twenty-eight-arch North River Great Iron Bridge was extremely important. The Pingbao railway and highway both relied on it for connection. It was the throat of Pingbao transportation. The torrent of the Juma River and Yi River merging under the bridge was deep enough to submerge a person. The silt at the bottom of the river meant it was difficult to pass through even for a person without belongings if the bridge was broken. In order to ensure the safety of this bridge, Kuomintang bandit Fu had personally sent a commissioner to lead the work, spending half a year building three steel-concrete high bunkers at both ends of the bridge and at the confluence of the Juma River and Yi River west of the bridge. He also built a dense layer of "prone bunkers" on both banks of the bridge. He also painstakingly transported some so-called "mobile fortresses" from Tianjin to form a modern and solid bridgehead bunker complex. Kuomintang bandit Fu once boasted that the North River Bridge fortifications were "as solid as gold," but the facts gave Kuomintang bandit Fu a resounding slap in the face.
    On the night of July 15th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army quickly occupied the North River Station and North River Village, compressing the defending enemy into the bunker complex at both ends of the North River Bridge. The enemy stronghold in nearby Dagou Village was also surrounded by us. Seventeen explosive heroes of the 8th Company of a certain unit calmly ambushed beside the bridge stronghold, preparing to first blow up the iron bridge in order to divide and annihilate the enemy guarding the bridge. Platoon leader Wang Yichen scouted the terrain three times and found a row of hidden bunkers on the south bank of the river, and a bunker complex at the confluence of the Juma River and Yi River in the north. They formed a crossfire network, making it difficult to pass through. He led the explosive heroes, jumped into the flowing water that was chest-deep, and waded through the enemy bunker complex's blockade zone, but the enemy still did not notice. With a "boom," the enemy began to fire wildly into the river. However, the bridge was broken. The enemy on both sides of the bridge had been divided. The People's Liberation Army blew up the iron bridge and occupied the positions at both ends of the iron bridge and on both sides of the railway. The enemy attempted to recapture these positions and prevent the People's Liberation Army from attacking its bridgehead bunker complex. On the 16th and 17th, they launched five counter-offensives, but all were repelled. On the morning of the 18th, it poured rain, and the rainwater filled the People's Liberation Army's fortifications. Two enemy planes strafed in the rain, and the enemy came to counterattack again. Comrade Li Quanyou, a soldier of the 1st Company of a certain unit, held a machine gun and jumped out of the mud, climbed up the trench, and fired two bursts of machine gun fire, driving the enemy back. Fighting until the afternoon, all of the People's Liberation Army's ammunition was wet, so the soldiers held their positions with bayonets. They persisted in the trenches filled with mud and water up to their chests for a day, and the enemy did not dare to counterattack again for a day. On the morning of the 19th, the People's Liberation Army's artillery roared, destroying the enemy's more than four-foot-thick steel-concrete high bunkers north of the bridge. The enemy all retreated into the bunker complex. Unexpectedly, the heroic infantry had already blown open the stronghold amidst the artillery fire and smoke, climbed over the outer trenches in front of the enemy bunkers, and stuffed hand grenades into the bunkers, shouting the slogan "Those who surrender will not be killed." Groups of prisoners crawled out of the bunkers. At this time, the People's Liberation Army's artillery was bombarding the enemy's bunker complex south of the bridge. As soon as the artillery fired, the enemy waved white flags and shouted, "Don't shoot! We surrender." The battle ended, and the headquarters and an entire battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Kuomintang 31st Provisional Division, as well as 1,173 people from the puppet North River Township, were all annihilated. Regiment Commander Pang Yu was captured alive. Immediately afterwards, a thunderous explosion rang out at the mouth of the North River Great Iron Bridge. This twenty-eight-arch Great Iron Bridge, the throat of the enemy's north-south transportation, was severed from then on.

    斩断平保交通喉管
    记炸毁平保路北河大铁桥
    “宁失定城，不失北河桥；没有北河桥，就没有保定。”这是蒋匪华北剿总副司令宋匪肯堂，亲到北河桥向守军训话时提出的警告。的确，二十八孔长的北河大铁桥，实在险要，平保铁路、公路都靠它连接，它是平保交通的咽喉，桥下拒马河与易水汇合的洪流，水深没顶，河底淤泥，如果桥断了，就是空身人也难通过。傅匪为了确保此桥，曾亲派专员率工，费了半年的时间，在桥的两端，及桥西拒马河北易水汇合点，修筑了三个钢骨水泥的高碉，在桥的两岸，修筑了密密的一层“伏地堡”。并费尽苦心，从天津运来一些所谓“活动堡垒”，构成现代化的坚固桥头堡垒群。傅匪曾吹牛说：“北河桥工事‘固若金汤’”，但是，事实却给了傅匪一记清脆的耳光。
    七月十五日夜间，解放军某部迅速攻占了北河车站和北河村，将守敌压缩到北河桥南北两头的堡垒群中。附近大沟村敌据点，亦被我包围。某部八连的十七个爆炸英雄，沉着地埋伏在桥边砦旁，准备先去炸断铁桥，以便分割歼灭守桥之敌。排长王毅臣，侦察了三次地形，发现南河边有一排暗堡，北面是拒马河与易水汇合点的堡垒群。组成了交叉火力网，很难过去。他率领着爆炸英雄们，跳进深及胸部的流水，涉过了敌堡垒群的封锁地带，敌人仍未发觉。“轰隆”一声，敌人才乱向河中开火。可是，桥已断了。桥的两岸敌人，已被分割开了，解放军炸断了铁桥，攻占了铁桥两端和铁路两侧的阵地，敌人企图夺回这些阵地，阻止解放军攻夺其桥头堡垒群。于十六、十七日两日，曾发起了五次反冲锋，但均被击退。十八日晨，大雨滂沱，雨水灌满了解放军的工事。匪机两架，冒雨扫射，敌人又来反扑。某部一连战士李全有，手抱机枪，从泥水中跳出来，爬上战壕，哗哗的两梭子机枪，把敌人打了回去。战至下午，解放军弹药全湿了，战士们就拿着刺刀坚持阵地，在泥水及胸的战壕中，坚持了一天，敌人一天不敢再反突击。十九日晨，解放军排炮怒吼，将敌桥北四尺多厚的钢骨水泥高碉摧毁，敌全部缩入地堡群中，想不到英勇的步兵，早已在排炮轰鸣、硝烟弥漫中，炸开了砦，爬过敌地堡前面的外壕，把手榴弹塞进了地堡里，喊起了“缴枪不杀”的口号。成群的俘虏，便从地堡里爬出来了。这时，解放军排炮正向桥南堡垒群之敌轰击。排炮一响，敌人就摇着白旗呐喊：“别打了！我们缴枪。”战斗结束了，匪暂三十一师第一团团部和一个整营，以及伪北河大乡共一一七三名，全部被歼。团长庞禹被活捉。紧接着，北河大铁桥口响起了一阵震天动地的爆炸声，这座二十八孔长的大铁桥，匪南北交通的咽喉，从此被斩断了。
