The working attitude and valuable qualities of Zhao Zhankui, the special-class labor hero of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, are a glorious banner of the Chinese working class. He is fifty-two years old this year and comes from Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province. His family was poor when he was young. His father wandered abroad, and his mother left home to wash clothes and cook for others. He had four brothers, and he was the third. From the age of ten, he and his two older brothers worked as hired laborers for others. Although the whole family worked, they still lived a life of hardship and humiliation. When he was seventeen, his father and second brother passed away. Under these tragic circumstances, he left his hometown and became an apprentice to a blacksmith, wandering around Tianzhen and Yanggao. After learning for two years, he went to Taiyuan to work as a bricklayer, then to the copper coin factory and foundry, and finally to the repair shop of the Jiexiu Station on the Tongpu Railway to work as a blacksmith. For more than twenty years, he lived by melting iron and copper, living a life of enslavement.

In early 1938, when the Japanese invaders occupied the Tongpu Railway, he and the railway workers on the line fled to Xi'an. At this time, he heard that Yan'an was a place led by the Communist Party and the home of the workers. So he joined the Youth Training Class run by the Eighth Route Army in Anwu Fort, Yunyang County, Guanzhong, and from there transferred to Yan'an. In Yan'an, he encountered something he never dreamed of in his life: he was actually able to study at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University and the Workers' School. This made him clearly realize that his destiny and the Communist Party and the revolution were inextricably linked. During his studies at the Workers' School, due to his diligent study and honest and loyal work, he became a glorious Communist Party member in December of that year.

In 1939, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government established a farm tool factory, and he was transferred to work as a foundry worker, which he gladly accepted. At that time, he realized that the revolutionary factory was the property of the revolution, that is, the property of the working class itself, and should be cherished and developed with all efforts. Therefore, in his work, he displayed extremely high labor enthusiasm and established a new labor attitude, working hard and thinking of the interests of the revolution in everything. During his time at the farm tool factory, he was always responsible for watching the furnace, which was the most arduous task. In front of the 2,000-degree high-heat furnace, even in summer, he had to wear cotton clothes and a leather apron, sweating all day long, but he worked for twelve hours. This arduous and unremarkable work, which most people were unwilling to do, he consistently persisted in, never expressing any uneasiness. Due to his positive and responsible work attitude, he received unanimous praise from the factory, which promoted the enthusiasm of the factory workers for production. The workers' evaluation of him was "Old Zhao was tempered in the fire." In every factory competition, Old Zhao was the winner of the first-class labor hero medal. In 1942, he was also elected by workers from four factories as an alternate member of the second session of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council.

Another characteristic of Zhao Zhankui's excellent qualities is his love for apprentices and concern for comrades. He is an old craftsman with excellent skills, but he does not have the bad habits of ordinary old craftsmen in treating apprentices. He never keeps his skills secret and tries his best to pass them on to his apprentices. He only has one belief: "Teaching one more apprentice will increase the revolutionary force by one point." Under his patient and meticulous teaching, many apprentices quickly became skilled workers. He is also concerned about the lives of his apprentices, often comforting them and taking care of them, like his own children.

During the most difficult years of 1941 to 1942 in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, life in the factories was very difficult, which affected the production mood of a small number of workers. And the factory's cooperative and food work was also the most difficult to manage. At that time, Zhao Zhankui was elected by the factory workers to take on this arduous task. Because he had a spirit of hard work and willingness to bear hardships, he did this work in the best and most perfect way. When he was in charge of the cooperative, he would sit in the cooperative to take care of the operation every day after work until everyone had finished eating, and then he would close the door to eat. He did not miss a penny for more than a year. He also tried every means to save food, organize production, and improve life. His spirit of loyalty, responsibility, and dedication to the slightest interests of the masses moved all the workers and aroused their enthusiasm for production.

When the instep of his foot was burned by hot molten copper in June 1943, he still insisted on his post, demonstrating the heroic and tenacious spirit of a combat hero who "does not leave the front line with minor injuries." Only after persuasion from the factory workers did he go to the hospital for recuperation. In the hospital, he donated all 15,000 yuan that the workers and schools had sent to comfort him to the soldiers at the front. In June and July, when the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to attack the border region, he requested to be discharged from the hospital to work before his foot injury had healed.

During Zhao Zhankui's time at the farm tool factory, the spirit of resolutely completing production tasks, cherishing revolutionary property, taking care of factory production, caring for the interests of the masses, uniting all factory workers, and abiding by labor discipline made the factory a model among the public-owned factories in the liberated areas. His consistent, positive, responsible, honest, hard-working, selfless, and self-sacrificing work style is also a model of the new labor attitude unique to workers in public-owned factories in the liberated areas. This valuable style of his is worth learning from. In 1943, under the direct leadership of the Central Workers' Committee and the Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, a warm Zhao Zhankui movement was launched in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Border Region government also awarded him the title of special-class worker labor hero of the Border Region. Since then, he has become the banner of the working class in the entire Border Region. New figures in the style of Zhao Zhankui are constantly emerging in factories in various liberated areas.

Comrade Zhao Zhankui not only has an excellent work style in peacetime, but also demonstrated the noble qualities of the proletariat in the war environment. When the Kuomintang bandit army launched a large-scale civil war across the country in May 1946, he accepted a new task: returning to the factory he had worked in to organize all the labor force to manufacture landmines. Because of the particular lack of workers, he first waged a resolute struggle against the labor ideology of belittling women. He mobilized and organized the family members of workers and women to participate in the work, encouraging them to complete the production task of manufacturing landmines alongside men, and cultivated a group of excellent female foundry workers. When the Kuomintang bandit army invaded Yan'an in late March 1947, the factory moved and buried all the equipment. The workers organized a guerrilla team to fight the enemy. Zhao Zhankui repeatedly requested to participate in the war, but the task assigned to him by his superiors was to lead the entire factory's family members, children, the old and the weak to relocate. He immediately took care of everything under those tense and difficult conditions, carrying children on his back and in his arms, helping the old and the young, and finally safely reached his destination.

This time, Zhao Zhankui, representing the workers of the Northwest, came to the Northeast to participate in the National Labor Congress. The Party, government, and military in the Northeast Liberated Area, especially the workers, welcomed him with unparalleled respect and love, wanting to learn from his valuable qualities. He also sincerely cared for and encouraged everyone to produce material strength for the revolution in order to accelerate the death of the Kuomintang ruling clique. He visited the industrial development of the Northeast Liberated Area along the way, which gave him great excitement and encouragement. The road of growth of labor hero Zhao Zhankui in the past ten years marks the road of the workers' movement.

　　工人的旗帜赵占魁
    陕甘宁边区特等劳动英雄赵占魁的劳动态度和宝贵品质，是中国工人阶级的一面光荣旗帜。他今年五十二岁，山西定襄县人。幼时家庭贫苦，父亲漂泊在国外，母亲离家给人洗衣做饭。他有兄弟四人，他排行第三。从十岁起他就与两个哥哥给人家当雇工。虽然全家劳动，但仍过着困苦与屈辱的生活。他十七岁时，父亲与二哥去世。在此种悲惨情况下，他离开了家乡，给一个铁匠当了学徒，漂泊在天镇、阳高一带。学了两年就到太原当泥水匠，后来又到铜元厂，翻砂厂做工，最后才到同蒲路介休车站修理厂打铁。他过去二十多年的日子，都是生活在熔铁和化铜炉旁，过着被奴隶的生活。
    一九三八年初日寇占领同蒲路时，他和该线铁路工人流亡到西安。这时他听说延安是共产党领导的地方，是工人的家，于是他就投入那时八路军在关中云阳县安吴堡办的青训班，并由那里转道到了延安。在延安时，他遇到一件一生梦想不到的事情，就是他居然能够进抗大与工人学校学习。这样使他清楚的认识到自己的命运和共产党与革命是血肉相连分不开的。在工人学校学习期间，由于他虚心学习与老实忠诚的工作，当年十二月，他便成为一个光荣的共产党员了。
    陕甘宁边区政府于一九三九年创办农具工厂，他即被调去当翻砂工人，他欣然的接受了。当时他就认识到：革命工厂是革命的财产，也就是工人阶级自己的财产，应当尽力爱护与发展它。于是在工作中，他发挥了极高度的劳动热情，树立了一种新的劳动态度，埋头苦干，一切为革命利益着想。他在农具工厂期间，一直是担任熔炉看火的工作，这是一种最辛苦的工作，在二千度高热的熔炉面前，即在夏天，身上还要穿着棉衣，披着皮裾，终日流汗不止，但他工作到十二小时。这一件辛苦而又不出名的平凡工作，一般人都不愿干，但他始终如一的坚持下去，从来没有表示过不安心。由于他的积极负责的工作态度，得到全厂上下一致的称赞，推动了全厂工人生产的积极性。工人们给他的评语是“老赵是从火里炼出来的。”在每一次全厂竞赛中，老赵都是甲等劳动英雄奖章的获得者。一九四二年他又被四个工厂的工友推选为陕甘宁边区第二届的候补参议员。
    赵占魁的优良品质又一特点，是爱护学徒，关心同志。他是一个有很好技术的老工匠，但他却没有一般老工匠对待学徒的坏习气。他从来对技术不保守，并将技术尽量传授给学徒。他只怀着一个信念：“多教会一个徒弟，多增加一分革命力量。”在他的循循善诱的教养之下，很多学徒很快就成为熟练工人。他对学徒的生活也很关心，经常慰勉他们，照顾他们，宛如自己的子弟。
    陕甘宁边区在一九四一至一九四二年最艰苦的年份中，工厂的生活十分困难，曾影响一小部分工人的生产情绪。而该厂的合作社和伙食工作亦最难办理。当时赵占魁即被全厂工人选举担任此一艰巨任务，但由于他有着任劳任怨的精神，他把这一工作办得最好最完善。在他管理合作社时，每天下了工，便坐在合作社里去照顾经营，一直到大家都吃完了饭，他才关门去吃饭。一年多的时间没有错过一分钱。他又想尽各种办法节省粮食，组织生产，改善了生活。他那种忠实负责为群众点滴利益而鞠躬尽瘁的精神，感动了所有的工人群众，激发了生产的积极性。
    当一九四三年六月他的脚面被灼热的铜水烧伤时，他仍坚持工作岗位，表现了战斗英雄般的“轻伤不下火线”的英勇顽强精神。经全厂工友的劝说，他才到医院去休养。在医院里，他把各工友、学校慰问他的一万五千元全部捐献给前方将士。到六七月间，国民党反动派企图进攻边区，他脚伤未愈就请求出院工作。
    赵占魁在农具工厂期间，所表现出来的坚决完成生产任务，爱护革命财产，照顾工厂生产，关心群众利益，团结全厂职工，遵守劳动纪律的精神，使该厂成为解放区公营工厂中的模范；他始终如一，积极负责，老老实实，埋头苦干，大公无私，自我牺牲的工作作风，也正是解放区公营工厂工人所特有的新的劳动态度的表率。他这种宝贵作风是值得大家学习的。一九四三年，在中央职工委员会及边区总工会直接领导下，首先在陕甘宁边区开展了热烈的赵占魁运动，边区政府更奖励他为边区特等工人劳动英雄。从此他就成为全边区工人阶级的旗帜。赵占魁式的新人物，不断涌现各解放区工厂中。
    赵占魁同志不但在平时有着优良的工作作风，而在战争的环境里也表现了无产阶级高贵的品质。当国民党匪军于一九四六年五月在全国范围内进行大规模内战时，他接受了一个新任务：回到过去的工厂里，组织一切劳动力制造地雷。因工人特别缺乏，他首先与轻视妇女的劳动思想作坚决的斗争，他动员与组织了工人家属妇女参加工作，鼓励她们与男人并肩完成制造地雷的生产任务，并培养了一批优秀的翻砂女工。当国民党匪军于一九四七年三月下旬侵入延安后，该厂把所有的器材都搬走和埋藏起来，工人们组织了游击队与敌斗争，赵占魁曾多次要求参战，但上级给他的任务是带领全厂家属小孩，老弱病号迁移。他即在那种紧张困难的条件下，一路背儿抱女，扶老携幼，前后照顾，终于安全的到达了目的地。
    这次赵占魁代表西北职工来到东北参加全国劳动大会，东北解放区党政军，特别是工人群众，以无比的敬爱欢迎他，想学习他的宝贵品质；他也衷心关怀鼓励大家，为革命生产物质力量，以加速国民党统治集团的死亡。他沿途参观了东北解放区工业发展的情况，给予他极大的兴奋和鼓舞。十年来，劳动英雄赵占魁成长的道路，正标志着职工运动的道路。　　【新华社东北电】
