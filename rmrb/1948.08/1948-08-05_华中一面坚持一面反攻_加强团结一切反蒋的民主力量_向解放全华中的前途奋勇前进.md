Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. Our branch reporter recently commented on the development of the Central China war situation in the past two years, saying: In the past two years, the military and civilians of Central China have experienced the stages of retreat, perseverance, and persevering on one hand while counterattacking on the other, and are now advancing courageously towards the liberation of all of Central China. From July 13, 1946 to the end of the year, after liberating and resisting the Kuomintang army's offensive and winning the great victories of the Seven Battles and Seven Victories in Central Jiangsu, the Defense of Huaiyin and Huai'an (Two Huai), the Defense of Lianshui, the Blocking Battle in Ye (Ting) South, and the Annihilation Battle in Su (qian) North, the main force made a strategic shift. Central China then entered a comprehensive situation of perseverance behind enemy lines. After more than half a year of arduous and repeated battles until the Battle of Ye Ting in August 1947, the military and civilians of Central China turned from perseverance to counterattack. The reporter made the following three-point summary analysis, saying: The changes in the Central China war situation can be observed from three aspects: (1) The People's Liberation Army has progressed from persevering in some villages and a few towns as bases to liberating and controlling most of the villages, many small and medium-sized towns, and seven cities including Ye Ting (Yancheng), Funing, Lianshui, Shuyang, Sixian, Siyang, and Suqian (Lianshui, Siyang, and Suqian were recovered in July this year, and the rest were recovered before June this year); from being divided into small guerrilla base areas by the enemy, it has become a contiguous liberated area. For example, Huainan and Huaibei were once completely occupied by the enemy, but now they have been gradually restored, and more than 20 county-level political powers have been rebuilt, liberating a population of three million. In the forward position of Central Jiangsu—the area south of Taizhou, Haian, Libao, and bēｎ＠①cha line, and north of the Yangtze River, spanning hundreds of miles vertically and more than three hundred miles horizontally—the enemy often used five or six thousand heavily armed troops to fight with us, with layers of blockhouses blocking the roads, and built up to 400 strongholds. Now our army has removed more than 300 enemy strongholds, controlling 800 miles of roads, forcing the enemy to be confined to a few isolated strongholds. In the area south of the Yangzhou-Taizhou line, our army has marched to the riverbank several times, posing a great threat to the enemy. Most of the (Nantong)-(Gan)yu line and the Yan(he)-(Shu)yang-Xin(fei) line in northern Jiangsu have been recovered by us. Now, except for the Grand Canal and Longhai lines (note: the 280 miles north of Huaiyin on the Grand Canal line up to the Longhai line is now under our control) and a few cities, almost the entire territory has returned to the people. (2) Our army has developed from comprehensive guerrilla warfare to large-scale mobile warfare. Since the Battle of Ye Ting in August last year, the Battle of Libao in December and the Battle of Ye (Ting) South, the Battle of Yilin in March this year, the Battle of Ye (Ting) South in May, the Battle of Waiyuan of Xin(pu) Hai(zhou) in June, and the Battle of Lianshui in July, each battle either captured towns and liberated large areas, or annihilated the enemy in whole regiments and brigades. In the second year of the war (from July 1947 to June 1948), a total of more than 136,000 enemy regular and local troops were annihilated (the results of the battles of Lianshui, Siyang, and Suqian are not included in the statistics), which is more than twice the 50,300 enemies annihilated during the first year of perseverance. During this period, a total of about 200,000 people in Central China joined the main force and local armed forces of the People's Liberation Army, which has brought about a major change in the balance of power between the enemy and us. Our local armed forces are growing stronger, while the enemy's puppet "Provincial Security Team" and other local armed forces are weakening. Taking the First Military Sub-district (under the jurisdiction of Dongtai, Rugao, and other counties) as an example, the comparison of the number of local armed forces between the enemy and us has changed from 12.2 to 1 in the past to 1 to 2.1 now. (3) When the enemy first invaded Central China, they were arrogant and clamored for "comprehensive suppression" and "comprehensive control." After our constant blows, they now have to call out "Northern Jiangsu is in danger" and "The river defense is tight." In April this year, we crushed the enemy's "mopping up" of Huainan with 30 regiments of troops. In May and June, we also crushed the enemy's large-scale "pursuit and suppression" of the Northern Jiangsu area by four divisions of troops, and then launched an offensive against the enemy, winning three major victories in the eastern section of Longhai, Lianshui, and Siyang. However, the enemy will not easily give up Central China. In a period of time, the situation in Central China will basically remain a situation of perseverance on one hand and counterattack on the other. Before the current situation undergoes fundamental changes, the enemy will still adopt the method of "robbing Peter to pay Paul," concentrating troops to carry out "mopping up" of our central areas and "suppression" of areas near its strongholds and on both sides of transportation lines, in an attempt to achieve the goal of "offensive as defense." Therefore, the military and civilians of Central China should still strengthen the concept of war, that is, strengthen the concept of perseverance and the concept of offense. When the enemy is "suppressing" and "mopping up," persevere in fighting in place; when our army counterattacks, cooperate in combat and support the front lines. Use perseverance to cooperate with counterattacks, prepare for counterattacks; use counterattacks to support perseverance and open up the situation of perseverance. In addition, seize the time to carry out production campaigns, unite all democratic forces that oppose the Kuomintang reactionary rule, so as to strengthen the foundation of perseverance and counterattack. At the same time, strengthen urban work, correctly implement urban policies and industrial and commercial policies, so as to prepare for the future recovery of more and larger cities.

### 华中一面坚持一面反攻  加强团结一切反蒋的民主力量  向解放全华中的前途奋勇前进

    华中一面坚持一面反攻
    加强团结一切反蒋的民主力量
    向解放全华中的前途奋勇前进
    【新华社华东二日电】分社记者顷评论两年来华中战局的发展称：两年来华中军民经历退守、坚持与一面坚持一面反攻的阶段，现在正向解放全华中的前途奋勇前进。从一九四六年七月十三日至年底，解放并抗击国民党军的进攻，获得苏中七战七捷、两淮（淮阴、淮安）保卫战、涟水保卫战、叶（挺）南阻击战、宿（迁）北歼灭战等伟大胜利后，主力即作战略的转移。华中便进入全面敌后坚持局面。经过半年余的坚苦的反复争夺战到一九四七年八月叶挺之战以后，华中军民即从坚持转入了反攻。记者就下列三点作概括的分析称：华中战局的变化可从三方面观察：（一）解放军从坚持部分乡村与少数市镇作为基地，进而解放与控制绝大部分的乡村、许多中小市镇以及叶挺（盐城）、阜宁、涟水、沭阳、泗县、泗阳、宿迁等七城（按涟水、泗阳、宿迁，系今年七月份收复，余均今年六月以前收复）；从被敌人分割的小块游击根据地，变为联成一片的解放区。例如淮南、淮北曾一度全陷敌手，现已逐步恢复，重建了二十余县政权，解放人口三百万。苏中前哨阵地——泰州、海安、李堡、ｂēｎ＠①茶一线以南、长江以北之纵百里横三百余里地区，敌人曾经常以五、六万重兵与我进行争夺，公路碉堡层层封锁，构筑据点达四百处，现我军已拔除敌据点三百余处，控制公路八百里，逼使敌人局处于少数孤立据点中。扬州、泰州线以南地区，我军数次进军江边，予敌人极大的威胁。苏北之（南）通（赣）榆线、盐（河）沭（阳）新（费）线绝大部分已为我收复，现除运河、陇海两线（按：运河线淮阴以北迄陇海线二百八十里，现已为我控制）及若干城市外，几已全境重归人民手中。（二）我军已从全面游击战发展为大规模的运动战。自去年八月叶挺之战，十二月李堡之战与叶（挺）南之战，今年三月益林之战，五月叶（挺）南之战，六月新（浦）海（州）外园之战，七月涟水之战，每打一仗，或则攻克城镇，解放大块地方，或则整团整旅的歼灭敌人。战争的第二年（一九四七年七月至一九四八年的六月）共歼敌正规军与地方军十三万六千余人（涟水、泗阳、宿迁战绩未统计在内），为战争第一年的坚持期间歼敌五万零三百余人的两倍以上。在这期间，华中人民参加解放军主力与地方武装者先后共约二十万人，使敌我力量对比发生重大变化。我地方武装日益发展，而敌伪“省保安队”等土著武装则日益减弱。以一分区（辖东台，如皋等县）为例，敌我地方武装数量的比较，由以前十二点二比一，变为现在的一比二点一。（三）敌人初犯华中时气焰嚣张，狂吠“全面清剿”、“全面控制”。经我不断打击，现在不得不呼叫“苏北危急”、“江防吃紧”了。今年四月间，我即粉碎了敌人以三十个团兵力对淮南的“扫荡”，五、六月间又粉碎了敌人四个师兵力对苏北区的大规模的“追剿”，其后并向敌展开进攻，获得陇海东段、涟水、泗阳三次大捷。但敌人是不会轻易放弃华中的，在一个时期内的华中形势，基本上仍然是一面坚持、一面反攻的形势。在当前情况未起根本变化前，敌人还会采取挖肉补疮的办法，调集兵力，向我中心地区进行“扫荡”，对其据点附近及交通线两侧进行“清剿”，企图达到“以攻为守”的目的。因此华中军民仍应该加强战争观念，也就是加强坚持观念与进攻观念。敌人“清剿”、“扫荡”时，坚持原地斗争；我军反攻时，配合作战，支援前线。以坚持配合反攻，准备反攻；以反攻支援坚持与打开坚持局面，此外争取时间开展生产运动，团结一切反对国民党反动统治的民主力量，以加强坚持与反攻的基础。同时，加强城市工作，正确贯彻执行城市政策、工商业政策，以准备今后收复更多的更大的城市。
