(Jinan Telegram) Flood rescue work is being vigorously carried out in various parts of Southern Hebei. The Yunhe River and Qingliang River in the Second Sub-district are full, and the counties along the river are taking flood prevention and emergency damming as the most urgent task. Flood control headquarters have been organized, and the main cadres of counties and districts are personally directing the work. Each district in Gu'an County has installed telephones to exchange information. All districts have mobilized a large number of able-bodied laborers to participate in repairing and raising the dikes. The counties in the Second Sub-district have all dispatched militia to patrol and guard the dikes to strictly prevent sabotage by bad elements. In Ningnan County, Fourth Sub-district, there were nine breaches in the Beisha River, with a total width of more than two hundred zhang. The county party committee issued an emergency instruction, calling on cadres at all levels to lead the masses in an emergency mobilization to fight against the flooding. The villages along the river in the First District have organized themselves and have already blocked the breaches north of Suqiu Village. Eight hundred qing of autumn seedlings in fifteen villages have been rescued. The Third District took the initiative to build embankments and excavated a three-li-long diversion ditch from the Zhang River. Aixin Village in the Fourth District took the initiative to build a "moon dike" to block leaking dikes. Thanks to the active rescue efforts of cadres and the masses in various districts and villages, all the breaches in the county were blocked on the evening of the 24th. Currently, the masses in the villages along the river are still guarding the dikes day and night.
