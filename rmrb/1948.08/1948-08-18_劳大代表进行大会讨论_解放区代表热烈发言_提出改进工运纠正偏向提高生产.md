Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th. After listening to the reports of Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun, the delegates of the Sixth National Labor Congress conducted group discussions on the 4th and 5th, and plenary discussions from the 6th to the 9th. During the discussions, Comrade Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, and Comrade Li Lisan, a leader of Chinese workers, made important speeches. All the representatives enthusiastically expressed their support for these two reports and fully agreed with the general task of the current Chinese labor movement – to thoroughly overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang, in China, and to build a new democratic Republic of China. The representatives shared their personal experiences and vivid facts from various regions, demonstrating the correctness of this general task from all angles. The speeches of the representatives during the plenary discussions constantly evoked enthusiastic slogans and applause.
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th. When the Labor Congress delegates from the liberated areas discussed the reports of Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun in groups and plenary sessions, they reflected that the working class in the liberated areas, who had become the masters of the country, were overcoming various difficulties and actively producing to support the war. The representatives from Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan said: To support Liu Deng's army marching south, the workers in Taihang launched a large-scale campaign to perform meritorious deeds. Clothing workers exceeded their tasks by an average of more than 70%, with the highest exceeding 120%. Zhen Rongdian, a famous labor hero of the military industry department, made amazing records in increasing production. Postal worker Hou Milong, nicknamed "Flying Legs," carried a 100-斤 heavy mailbag and walked more than 160 里 across the mountains every day. Workers in a certain place in the Northeast jumped into the water in temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius to repair machines. Li Mingzhe of the Northeast Railway Delegation said: In the past two years, we have made nearly 10,000 kilometers of railways in the Northeast run smoothly, ensuring the transportation of all military supplies and personnel to the front. Yang Changchun of the Northeast Coal Mine said: 596 miners in Northeast mines have been promoted to administrative cadres of the mines, and 743 miners have been elected as trade union cadres. Coal production has generally increased compared with the time of the puppet Manchukuo regime, with some increasing two to three times. The representatives from Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning said: In the frequently war-torn environment, the workers in the region expanded military production dozens of times in two years. When Beipiao Mine was liberated last year, the workers spontaneously organized to protect the machines and welcome the People's Liberation Army, and restored power supply in four hours. The representatives from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia said: During the Hu bandits' attack, the workers buried machines, transferred materials, and organized workers' guerrillas to attack the enemy, achieving great results. Zhao Zhankui, a banner of the working class in the liberated areas, used his two different personal experiences of working under the rule of the Kuomintang and in the liberated areas to illustrate that there was only a way out by uniting under the banner of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He called on the workers in the liberated areas to work hard to increase production, support the war, overthrow the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and strive for the complete liberation of the working class and the people of the whole country. The representatives from East China said: In order to completely paralyze the enemy's lifeline of transportation, the workers of the Lin-Zao Railway built railways during the day under the coercion of the enemy, and then cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to dismantle them overnight. Regarding the fact that the workers in the liberated areas have become the masters of the country, Zhang Fulin of the East China delegation cited a vivid example. He said: An American jeep ran over rickshaw driver Su Mingcheng in Qingdao, and no one cared. However, when the same American car ran over rickshaw driver Yang Lukui in Yantai during the liberation period last year, it aroused the protest of the city's workers. As a result, the Americans had to escort the coffin for burial and pay compensation to the family of the deceased. Zhang Lizhi of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei delegation said: The workers in Shijiazhuang have clearly realized that the Kuomintang reactionaries are the public enemy of the Chinese working class, so they are actively producing to support the war. For example, the workers in the yarn factory used to weave forty cars in twelve hours, but now they can weave forty-two cars in eight hours.
In order to further increase production and strive for an early victory in the Liberation War, the representatives discussed the management of state-owned enterprises and labor-capital relations in great detail and enthusiasm. On the management of state-owned enterprises, the representatives from Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei took the situation during the liberation of Zhangjiakou as an example and reviewed the deviations such as egalitarianism in wages, excessively high wages, and wage assessment based on political conditions. For example, the highest wage was raised from 80 斤 of rice to 720 斤, which could not be sustained. Instead of trying to organize the production of unemployed workers, they were simply given relief, and even the relief money per person exceeded the wages of employed workers. These actually played a destructive role in industry and should be corrected in the future. The representatives from Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan pointed out that, thanks to the preliminary exploration of the enterprise-based production organization in Taihang factories and the implementation of economic accounting and piece-rate contracting, the workers' enthusiasm for production was greatly improved, output was increased, quality was improved, and costs were reduced. The number of non-production personnel in factories was also reduced from an average of 25% to 10%. Regarding private enterprises, Zhang Weizhen, the representative of Harbin, reviewed the past deviation of excessive dividends and automatically corrected it after persuading and educating the workers; and automatically established new labor discipline, which enabled production to develop and employment to increase. From mid-March to the end of June, Harbin added a total of 3,743 factories and stores, of which industry accounted for 2,917. The number of employed staff, workers, and shop assistants increased by more than 26,400. In the past six months, Harbin has employed more than 44,000 unemployed workers. In order to further improve the labor movement, Zhang Weizhen proposed: (1) Strengthen the labor movement in state-owned and public enterprises. Workers should learn business management knowledge and oppose and overcome bureaucratic leadership styles. Strengthen and promote the factory management committee organization. (2) Implement a cross-progressive graded wage system to realize the reasonable principle of more pay for more work. (3) In private enterprises, continue to implement the democratic government's policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital" and the policy of unity and improvement. (4) Consolidate and expand the production cooperation organizations of individual laborers, and cultivate reasonable cadres for cooperative production. (5) Strengthen workers' welfare undertakings, organize workers' consumer cooperatives, run various workers' education programs, strengthen workers' hospitals, and run medical cooperative societies. In addition, it is necessary to improve cadres, change work styles, rely on and give play to the organization and awareness of workers, and truly implement the spirit of Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun's reports into production.
In addition, Li Fenglian, a female representative from the Northwest, used her own personal experience to explain the issue of women's participation in production, saying that women must participate in production to gain liberation, so that they can obtain the ability to live independently, work hard with men to support the war, and completely overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary group. Model engineer Qian Zhidao emphasized that revolutionary technicians should combine with the masses, put down their airs, and respect and learn from the creations of the masses in labor practice.

　　劳大代表进行大会讨论
  　解放区代表热烈发言
    提出改进工运纠正偏向提高生产
    【新华社东北十六日电】第六次全国劳动大会全体代表于听取高岗、陈云两同志报告后，在四、五两日进行小组讨论，六日至九日进行大会讨论。讨论中，中国劳动协会理事长朱学范、中国职工领袖李立三两同志作了重要发言。全体代表一致热烈表示拥护这两个报告，完全同意中国职工运动当前的总任务——彻底推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党在中国的统治，建设新民主主义的中华人民民主共和国。各代表纷纷以自己的切身经验，及各地生动事实，从各方面证明了这一总任务的正确。大会讨论中，各代表的发言不断引起热烈的口号和掌声。
    【新华社东北十六日电】劳大各解放区代表于小组和大会讨论高岗、陈云两同志报告时，都反映出已成为国家主人翁的解放区工人阶级，已经并正在为支援战争而克服种种困难，积极生产。晋冀鲁豫代表说：太行工人为了支援刘邓南下大军，曾发动了一次大规模的立功运动，被服工人平均超过任务百分之七十以上，最高者超过百分之一百二十。著名的军工部劳动英雄甄荣典在增进生产上造出惊人纪录。外号飞毛腿的邮工侯米龙，身背一百斤重的邮包，每天翻山越岭走一百六十余里。东北某地工人，在零下三十几度的天气里跳下水去修理机器。东北铁路代表团李明哲说：两年多来，我们已使东北将近一万公里的铁路畅通无阻，保证了前线一切军需兵员的运输。东北煤矿代表杨长春说：东北各矿有五百九十六个矿工被提拔为矿山的行政干部，有七百四十三个矿工被选为工会干部。煤的生产比伪满统治时普遍提高，有的提高了两倍至三倍。冀察热辽代表说：该区职工们在战争频繁的环境中，使军工生产在两年中就扩大了数十倍。北票矿山工人于去年北票解放时，自动组织起来，保护机器，迎接解放军，在四小时中就恢复了送电。陕甘宁代表说：工人在胡匪进攻中，埋藏机器，转运物资，并组织工人游击队袭击敌人，获得很大成绩。解放区工人旗帜赵占魁更以他在国民党统治下和在解放区作工时两种不同的切身经验，说明只有团结在共产党毛主席的旗帜下，才有出路。他号召解放区工人努力提高生产，支援战争，打倒国民党反动派统治，争取工人阶级和全国人民的彻底解放。华东代表说：临枣线铁路工人为使敌人交通命脉完全麻痹，白天在敌人强迫下修建铁路，晚间就又配合解放军连夜拆毁。对于解放区工人已成为国家的主人这一点，华东代表团张福林举了一个生动事例。他说：美军吉普车在青岛压死洋车夫苏明成，结果无人过问。可是同样的美国人车子去年在烟台解放期间压死洋车夫杨禄奎时，就引起了全市工人的抗议，结果美国人不得不为死者扶灵安葬抚恤死者家属。晋察冀代表团张立之说：石家庄工人都已明确的认识了国民党反动派是中国工人阶级的公敌，因此正积极生产，支援战争。如纱厂工人过去十二小时摇四十车，现在八小时就能摇四十二车了。
    为了进一步提高生产，争取解放战争早日胜利，各代表对公营企业的经营管理、劳资关系等问题，讨论极为详尽热烈。在公营企业的经营管理上，晋察冀代表以张家口解放期间的情形为例，检讨了工资中的平均主义、过高工资和根据政治条件评工资等偏向。如最高工资由八十斤米一直提高到七百二十斤，结果无法支持。对失业工人不是设法组织其生产，而是单纯救济，甚至每人救济金超过在业工人工资。这些实际上对工业是起了破坏作用，今后要很好纠正。晋冀鲁豫代表提出，太行各厂由于初步摸索了企业化的生产组织，实行了经济核算和按件包工全面工资制以后，工人生产热情大为提高，增加了产量，提高了质量，并减低了成本。工厂非生产人员也由平均百分之二十五减少为百分之十。在对私营企业上，哈尔滨市代表张维桢检讨过去曾发生过高分红偏向，后经对职工的说服教育，才自动的纠正了；并自动的建立了新的劳动纪律，使生产得到发展，职工就业增加。从三月中旬到六月底，哈市增加工厂商店共三千七百四十三家，其中工业就占了二千九百十七家，就业职员、工人和店员较前共增加了两万六千四百余人。半年来哈市共有四万四千余失业职工就业。为进一步改进工运，张维桢提出：（一）加强国营、公营企业中的工运工作，职工应学习业务管理知识，反对与克服官僚主义的领导作风。加强与推广工厂管委会组织。（二）实行交叉累进等级工资制，以实现多劳多得的合理原则。（三）在私营企业中，继续贯彻民主政府“发展生产，劳资两利”的政策及联合与改良的方针。（四）巩固与扩大个体劳动者的生产合作组织，培养合作生产合理干部。（五）加强工人福利事业，组织工人消费合作社，举办各种工人教育，加强职工医院，举办医药合作社。此外还要提高干部，转变作风，依靠与发挥职工的组织性与觉悟性，把高岗、陈云同志的报告精神真正贯彻到生产中去。
    此外，西北妇女代表李凤莲对妇女参加生产问题，以她自己的亲身经验说明妇女要求得解放，必须参加生产，使自己获得独立生活的能力，与男人一起努力支援战争，彻底打倒国民党反动集团。模范工程师钱志道则强调革命的技术人员应和群众结合，放下架子，尊重与学习群众在劳动实践中的创造。
