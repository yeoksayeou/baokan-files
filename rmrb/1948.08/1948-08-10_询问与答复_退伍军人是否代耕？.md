    Inquiry and Reply Should Veterans Receive Substitute Farming?
    Editor:
    Regarding whether veterans should receive substitute farming, there are several veterans in our village. Some are slightly disabled, while others still have some labor capacity. The masses have some opinions about providing substitute farming for them. Please reply as to whether substitute farming should be provided.
    Zanhuang West Street Du Zaiwen, Wang Shuanhe

    Comrades Du Zaiwen and Wang Shuanhe: The Civil Affairs Department of the Border Government has replied to your question as follows:
    "Generally, veterans should not receive substitute farming. Public funds or other means can be used to help them engage in production and establish their households. If they are severely disabled and genuinely unable to engage in labor, substitute farming or organized mutual aid can be provided."

    询问与答复  退伍军人是否代耕？
    编辑同志：
    退伍军人是否代耕，我村有好几个退伍的，有的是有点残废，有的是还有劳力，群众给他代耕有好些意见，是否代耕请答复。
    赞皇西街  杜在文、王拴和
    杜在文、王拴和同志：你们的问题，边府民政厅社会科已答复如下：
    “退伍军人一般不代耕，可用公款或其他方式帮助其从事生产，建立家务。如身体残废过重真正不能从事劳动者，可代耕或组织挨工。”
