[Taihang Telegraph] Thanks to the vigorous support of the Xingtai City Democratic Government and the active efforts of workers, the textile industry in Xingtai City has gradually recovered and developed, with improvements in both technology and quality. In late July, a reporter interviewed Yan Jinyu, a veteran textile worker of over 20 years and current chairman of the textile workers' union in the Third District of Xingtai City. He excitedly described the recovery and development of the textile industry: During the Japanese occupation, cotton became a military supply and was completely controlled. All private textile factories, large and small, in the city were shut down. After the liberation of Xingtai City in the autumn of 1945, the Democratic Government actively supported the industry. Initially, there were only six or seven small factories weaving cloth, socks, and towels. By this year, the city has increased to more than thirty textile factories. Among them are eighteen cloth weaving factories, three towel factories, and sixteen sock factories. In addition, there are six silk weaving factories and a number of household textile businesses.

Regarding the use of machines and technological improvements, he said: In 1946, most textile factories in the city used wooden looms. At that time, it was believed that local cotton thread could not be woven on iron looms, and even if it could, it would not be popular. Later, after repeated research, it was discovered that local cotton thread could be woven on iron looms. One of the important factors in achieving this success was the improvement in women's cotton spinning technology. He said: At this time last year, buying fine thread at the market would yield at most ten or eight jin per market. This year, each market can yield hundreds of jin, and it's available whenever needed. All thirty-plus factories have no shortage of thread. Moreover, the quality of the thread is shiny, uniform, and strong. As he spoke, he compared the thread left over from last year with this year's thread, saying, "The progress is really fast; the two threads are vastly different. We once experimented with combining foreign thread and local thread of equal weight, and we finished the combination at the same time. We were really happy!"

Regarding the quality of finished products, he picked up a piece of coarse cotton wide-width calico that had just come off the loom and said: It's flat, thick, white, and good-looking, and the masses like it very much. He said: The city's more than seventy looms produce more than forty bolts of cloth a day. Since the temple fair in May this year, the factories can sell as much cloth as they can produce. For a few days, the cloth was booked before it even came off the looms because the factories sell cloth to the masses for two hundred yuan cheaper per zhang than the market price. The factories not only meet the needs of the masses but also organize and support the production of the masses, such as accepting both good and bad thread when purchasing (which should not hinder quality improvement – Editor). The production enthusiasm of the masses is very high. The factories obtain the supply of raw materials from the broad masses, ensuring the development and expansion of the factories.

Finally, he said excitedly: Overcoming various difficulties on a relatively backward industrial foundation and being able to develop and improve is a characteristic of industrial construction in the liberated areas. Recently, a textile worker from Tianjin tried to weave local cotton thread on an iron loom, but failed after two days of trying. He highly praised the spirit of the workers in the liberated areas in overcoming difficulties and their manufacturing capabilities.

　　邢市织工发挥创造天才
  　铁机改织土线宽布质量提高销路畅快
    小型纺织厂增至三十余家
    【太行电】邢台市纺织业经民主政府大力扶植与工人积极努力，逐渐恢复与发展，技术和质量均有提高。记者于七月底访问二十多年的纺织老工人、现任邢市三区纺织工会主席阎金玉，他非常兴奋的叙述着纺织业恢复发展的过程：日寇统治时，棉花成了军用品，完全被管制起来。全市私人的大小纺织工厂全部停业。一九四五年秋邢市解放后，民主政府即积极扶植，最初只有六、七家织布、织袜、织毛巾的小型工厂，到今年全市已增加到三十多家纺织厂。其中有织布工厂十八家，毛巾厂三家，织袜厂十六家，此外还有六家丝织厂及不少家庭纺织业。在机子的使用与技术改进上，他说：一九四六年全市纺织厂大部用木机，当时以为土线不能用铁机织，即使织出来也不受人欢迎。后来经过再三研究，发现土线完全能用铁机织。取得这个成绩的重要因素之一，是妇女纺线技术的提高，他说：去年此时到集上收买细线，一集顶多有十斤八斤，今年每集能收百斤，啥时要啥时有。三十多家工厂都不缺线子。且线的质量又光又匀又有劲。说着他把去年留下的线与今年的线比较了一下，他说：“真进步的快，两样线差的太远了。我们曾试验过用同等重量的洋线与土线合股，同时合完，实在高兴哪！”在成品质量上，他拿起一匹刚刚下机的粗线宽面花布说：又平整又厚又白又好看，群众非常喜欢。他说：全市七十多架织布机，一天出四十多匹布，今年五月庙以后，厂里有多少布就能卖多少，有几天布还不下机子就被订走了，因为工厂卖给群众的布比市场每丈便宜二百元。工厂不仅供给了群众的需要，而且组织与扶助了群众的生产，如收线时好坏都收（应不妨害提高质量——编者），群众生产情绪很高。工厂得到广大群众原料的供给，保证了工厂的发展与扩大。最后他很兴奋的说：在比较落后的工业基础上克服各种困难，能够加以发展提高，这是解放区工业建设的特色。最近从天津来的一位纺织工人曾试用铁机织土线，试织了两天都没闹成，他非常赞扬解放区工人克服困难的精神，和制造的能力。
