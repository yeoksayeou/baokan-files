North Yue Financial Office Directive
Launch Manure Pressing Campaign
Conduct Rainy Season Tree Planting
[North Yue News] The North Yue Financial Office recently issued a directive on launching a green manure pressing campaign and conducting rainy season tree planting. Excerpts:

Last year's drought resulted in short grass, and coupled with the focus on land review, little manure was pressed. In many areas, fertilizer accumulation decreased by one-third, leading to insufficient fertilizer this year, impacting increased production. To effectively resolve the fertilizer problem for this autumn's wheat planting and next year's sowing, it is necessary to seize the slack agricultural season after weeding seedlings in the hot weather to extensively launch an organized, leadership-guided green manure pressing campaign with specific requirements. Areas with established practices and conditions (mountainous regions) are urged to exceed the 1944 achievement of pressing 500 to 1,000 jin of grass per laborer this year; areas without manure pressing habits (plains) should also make every effort to use various weeds and wheat roots for manure pressing. County and district leading organs must send cadres to the countryside in advance to deploy this work, paying attention to mobilizing women, children, and other semi-laborers to participate widely. They must also conduct thorough supervision and inspection to ensure that this campaign achieves results. The rainy season tree planting period is longer, and survival is easier. Planting is possible in plains fields, and it is more suitable to combine it with river basin management and embankment protection. However, many areas still lack the habit, so a universal requirement will not be made this year. Starting with the North Yue Administrative Office, down to each district, locations must be designated (at least three villages per level) for typical demonstrations, with the aim of gradual promotion.

    北岳财经办事处指示
    开展压肥运动
    进行雨季植树
    【北岳讯】北岳财经办事处日前发出开展压绿肥运动与进行雨季植树的指示。略：
    去年天旱草短，又加忙于复查，压肥很少，许多地方积肥减少三分之一，以致今年肥料不足影响增产。为确实有效地解决今秋种麦与明年播种的肥料问题，必须抓紧伏天锄苗以后的农闲季节，有组织有领导有具体要求地广泛开展压绿肥运动。号召有习惯有条件的地区（山地），今年压肥数量要超过一九四四年每个劳动力压草五百斤至一千斤的成绩；没有压肥习惯的地区（平原）也要尽量将各种杂草麦根用于压肥。各县县区领导机关必须事前专派干部分头下乡，布置这一工作，注意发动妇女儿童等半劳动力广泛参加。并须深入督促检查，务使这一运动获得成绩。雨季植树时间较长，成活亦易，平原田地都能栽植，沿河流域与护滩护岸结合进行更为相宜。惟不少地区尚无习惯，今年暂不作普遍要求，先从北岳行署起，以至各区，均须自行划定地点（每级至少三村），典型示范，以期逐渐推广。
