Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The Kuomintang government has adopted two new treasonous measures, formally establishing the special privileges of US imperialism to supervise and monopolize industry, mining, and transportation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. One is the joint establishment of a "Sino-US Joint Committee for Handling Construction and Equipment Replacement Funds" with the United States, as a comprehensive supervisory body for the United States over industry, mining, and transportation in the Kuomintang areas. According to Yen Chia-kan, a member of the "US Aid Utilization Committee" of the Kuomintang Executive Yuan, at a press conference in Nanjing on the 20th, the "Sino-US Joint Committee" will be composed of two American members and three members of the Kuomintang government, serving as the so-called "policy-making body for the use of funds." The US "Economic Cooperation Administration" has announced that it will allocate 70 million US dollars from the 275 million US dollars of so-called "economic aid" given to the Kuomintang government as a special fund for US aggression in China's industry, mining, and transportation, namely the so-called "industrial construction and equipment replacement costs." It is reported that the so-called "Proposal for China's Industrial Revival and Major Equipment Replacement Plan" has been formulated by the US Economic Cooperation Administration and submitted to the Kuomintang government by Stillman and Lepham. The establishment of the "Joint Committee" is to supervise the implementation of this American aggression plan. Another treasonous measure is to allow the United States to send a large number of "experts" to directly control the industry, mining, and transportation sectors in the Kuomintang areas. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 18th, Pei Tsu-yi, the Kuomintang's traitorous envoy to the United States, has "with the consent of the US government," signed a "preliminary draft agreement" with the US White Engineering Project Company, under which the company will send "engineering experts" to China, under the guise of being "employed" by the Kuomintang government, to freely control the industry, mining, and transportation in the Kuomintang areas. These "experts" have the right to "design and review various construction plans." The news acknowledged that Crawford and Talling, two "experts" from White Company, had arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and more "experts" will arrive in China one after another.

　　国民党政府卖国新罪行
  　工矿交通都被美帝监督
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】国民党政府又采取两项新的卖国措施，正式确立了美帝国主义对国民党统治区工、矿、交通的监督、垄断特权。其一为与美国合组一“处理建设及配备替换基金之中美联合委员会”，作为美国对国民党区工、矿、交通的全面监督机关。据国民党行政院“美援运用委员会”委员严家淦二十日在南京记者招待会上承认：“中美联合委员会”即将由美国委员二人会同国民党政府三人组成，作为所谓“基金使用之政策决定机关”。美国“经济合作总署”已宣布，将从美国给国民党政府的二亿七千五百万美元所谓“经济援助”中，拨出七千万美元作为美国对中国工、矿、交通的侵略专款，即所谓“工业建设及配备替换费用”。据息，所谓“中国工业复兴及主要配备替换计划之建议案”已由美经济合作总署制定，并经史蒂尔曼、莱普汉提交国民党政府。“联合委员会”之成立即为监督实行美国此项侵略计划。另一卖国措施为允许美国派遣大批“专家”直接控制国民党区工、矿及交通部门。据中央社上海十八日消息透露：现在美国之国民党卖国专使贝祖诒已“于美政府同意下”，与美国怀特工程计划公司订立“初步草约”，由该公司派遣“工程专家”来华，假国民党政府“雇用”名义，自由控制国民党区工、矿、交通，这些“专家”有权“设计、审核各项建设计划”。该消息承认：怀特公司“专家”克劳福特及塔林两人已于日前抵沪，其他更多“专家”亦将陆续来华。
