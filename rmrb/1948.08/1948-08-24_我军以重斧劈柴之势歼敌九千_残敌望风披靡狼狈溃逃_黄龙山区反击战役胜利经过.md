Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 22nd: Frontline reporters report on the victorious course of the counter-attack campaign in the Huanglong Mountain area, stating: The counter-attack campaign our army conducted from the 8th to the 10th began in the Fengyuan area at the foot of the Huanglong Mountains. It adopted a central breakthrough tactic, inflicting a devastating blow on the bandit's reorganized 36th Division and its three subordinate brigades, causing the enemy's entire line to collapse and laying a favorable foundation for our army's continued offensive. This echoes the great victory of our army in the Yichuan campaign this spring, where we used the tactic of besieging the city and striking at reinforcements, annihilating five reorganized enemy brigades.

Since the Hu bandit's disastrous defeat in the Jingwei area, they have deployed five reorganized divisions, totaling fourteen reorganized brigades (namely, the reorganized 36th Division, the reorganized 1st Division with three brigades each, the reorganized 17th Division, the reorganized 38th Division, the reorganized 6th Division with two brigades each, the 1st Cavalry Brigade, and the 61st Brigade of the reorganized 90th Division), and two security brigades, stretching in a line of approximately 400 li from ＠yi in the west to Taiyang in the east. This formed a "one-character long snake" formation to shield their Weibei Plain, and they continuously harassed our Guanzhong and Huanglong Sub-districts, covering their Baojia personnel's seizure of grain and conscription of men. Simultaneously, the Kuomintang Central News Agency wildly proclaimed that "a major battle is brewing at the foot of the Huanglong Mountains," but in reality, they were attempting to achieve their defensive goals. Towards the end of July, in order to make up for the impact of their disastrous defeats in the Central Plains and Jinzhong, the Jiang Hu bandits used the reorganized 6th Division to feign an attack on our Guanzhong Sub-district, to cover their deployment of the reorganized 30th Division by air to reinforce the isolated city of Taiyuan. They also mobilized the reorganized 1st Division, reorganized 36th Division, reorganized 17th Division, and reorganized 38th Division, totaling four divisions, advancing in three routes from Tongguan, Bai, Cheng, and Tai, attempting to invade our Hancheng and Shibao (location of Huanglong County government). However, the enemy, intimidated by our army's might, had to crawl forward cautiously, constantly apprehensive, never straying far from deep trenches and high ramparts, fearing to repeat Liu Kan's mistakes in the Wazi Street of Yichuan. The enemy's unit of the reorganized 1st Division stationed in Tongguan ventured north from Kuquan on the 4th, advancing to Youfangtai, only to be annihilated by our alert troops after wiping out an entire company, and dared not advance further. The reorganized 38th Division and reorganized 17th Division of Dali and Taiyang only advanced 20 li in the ten days after the "offensive" began, averaging only two li per day. The reorganized 36th Division of Bai and Cheng advanced to an area 50 li northwest of Chengcheng on the 30th of last month and then stopped, using the natural terrain to build a "mouth"-shaped defensive system in a narrow area 20 li long from east to west and 15 li long from north to south, with Hutishan as the pivot. The enemy's 28th Brigade used Hutishan and its southwest foothills, and the 165th Brigade used the southeast foothills of Hutishan as the left and right wings, constructing positions by relying on deep trenches and high ramparts. The 123rd Brigade and the division headquarters were stationed in villages south of Hutishan. Hutishan overlooked the surrounding area. The enemy's defenses were still very tight, and based on the deep trenches, earthen walls, and large villages on the plains, they built a network of fortified points coordinated with triangular pillboxes, attempting to cower in the defensive system for safety and seize the opportunity to capture our important town of Shibao.

Our army, after the successive victories in the Yichuan and Jingwei areas, immediately adopted a posture of preparedness, conducting four political assessments (assessing fighting spirit, intelligence, command, and policy) and military training (training in tactics and techniques). The morale of commanders and soldiers was unprecedentedly high, and they all wrote letters requesting battle. Our frontline headquarters then decided to use the central breakthrough tactic to concentrate and annihilate the enemy's larger and more concentrated force—the reorganized 36th Division. After receiving the battle call, our units launched the attack with lightning speed and fierce action. After the battle began, our army used the force of splitting wood with a heavy axe, continuously capturing eight important strongholds of the enemy's alert positions in four hours. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, our army on the front launched a general offensive against the enemy's main position on Hutishan. Under the cover of our superior firepower, our brave infantry captured Hutishan in about two hours. After our army broke through this commanding height, we advanced rapidly, splitting the 165th Brigade and the 123rd Brigade into two parts each. We then directly attacked the enemy division headquarters, breaking through the enemy command center, and then split the 165th Brigade and the 123rd Brigade into several small pieces, and then surrounded and annihilated them in blocks. The remaining enemies fled south on the night of the 8th, and were intercepted and pursued by our army along the way. Finally, on the night of the 9th, they were once again surrounded and annihilated by our ambushing troops and pursuing troops in Wangzhuang Town and the Yijing area to the south. In two days, a total of more than 9,000 enemy officers and soldiers were killed, wounded, and captured. The remaining enemies fled in disarray under the cover of night.

In this battle, our army's infantry and artillery cooperated closely, the combat actions were brave and skilled, and the commanders on each line were resourceful and flexible, and highly developed the fighting style of fierce attack, fierce charge, and fierce pursuit. This proves that during the summer training, the class consciousness of the entire army's commanders and fighters has been increasingly improved, and there has been a leap forward in tactics and technology. Therefore, in the first round of our army's expedition, the reorganized 36th Division, known as one of the Hu bandits' three main forces, was once again subjected to the fate of being annihilated and captured without any ability to fight back. The enemies on other fronts all collapsed and fled at the sight of our army, and our army took advantage of the victory to recover the three county towns of Tai, Cheng, and ＠.

The great victory of this counter-attack not only further consolidated our new liberated area of Huanglong Mountain, but also powerfully struck the Hu bandits' conspiracy to harass our Yuxi liberated area, and coordinated our Central Plains People's Liberation Army's struggle to liberate the entire Central Plains.

　　我军以重斧劈柴之势歼敌九千
  　残敌望风披靡狼狈溃逃
    黄龙山区反击战役胜利经过
    【新华社西北前线二十二日电】前线记者报导黄龙山区反击战役胜利的经过称：我军八日至十日进行的反击战役，是在黄龙山麓的冯原地区开始的，它采取了中央突破的战法，给匪整编三十六师及所属的三个旅以歼灭性打击，使敌全线瓦解，奠下我军今后继续进攻的有利基础。这与今春我军在宜川战役中运用围城打援，歼灭敌五个整编旅的伟大胜利前后辉映。
    自胡匪在泾渭地区惨败后，即以五个整编师共计十四个整编旅（即整三十六师、整一师各三个旅、整十七师、整三十八师、整六师各两个旅、骑一旅、整九十师之六一旅）及两个保安旅，分列于西起＠邑，东达邰阳，筑成一条约四百余里的一字长蛇阵，以屏障其渭北平原，并不断袭扰我关中分区及黄龙分区，掩护其保甲人员抢粮抓丁。同时国民党中央社即狂叫“黄龙山麓酝酿大会战”，而实际上是企图以此来达到他的防御目的。迨至七月下旬，蒋胡匪为弥补其中原与晋中惨败的影响，遂以整六师徉攻我关中分区，以掩护其抽调整编三十师空运增援太原孤城，并调动其整编一师、整编三十六师、整编十七师、整编三十八师等四师兵力于同、白、澄、邰分三路进犯，图侵占我韩城及石堡（黄龙县府所在地）。但敌慑于我军声威，不得不龟步爬行，处处提心吊胆，步步不离深沟高垒，惟恐再蹈刘戡在宜川瓦子街的覆辙。驻同官敌整一师一部于四日由苦泉北犯，进至油房台仅被我警戒部队歼灭一个整连后即不敢再进。大荔、邰阳敌整编三十八师及整编十七师，在“进攻”开始后十天中仅前进二十里，每日平均仅前进两里。白、澄敌整编三十六师于上月三十日进至澄城西北五十里地区即停滞不动，利用天然地形在东西长二十里、南北长十五里之狭小地带筑起一“口”字形的防御体系，以壶梯山为枢纽。敌二十八旅以壶梯山及其西南麓，一六五旅在壶梯山东南麓左右两翼借深沟高垒构筑阵地，一二三旅及师部则于壶梯山南麓利用村落设防。壶梯山俯瞰四周，敌设防仍甚周密，并依据平原上的深沟土城及大的村落，筑成集团工事与三角形伏地堡相配合的星罗棋布般的据点工事，妄图龟缩在防御体系内求得安全，并伺隙攻取我石堡重镇。
    我军方面自经宜川与泾渭地区连续作战胜利后，即以备战姿态进行政治上的四评（即评斗志，评智慧，评指挥，评政策）及军事上的练兵（练战术及技术），指战员情绪空前高昂，纷纷上书请战。我前线指挥部遂决定以中央突破战术，聚歼敌兵力较大较集中的一股——整三十六师。我各部队得到战斗号召后，乃以迅雷不及掩耳的勇猛动作展开攻击。战斗发起后，我军以重斧劈柴之势，在四小时内即连续攻克敌警戒阵地的八个重要据点。八日下午四时，正面我军即向壶梯山敌之主阵地带发起总攻，在我优势火力掩护下，我英勇步兵在约两小时内即夺下壶梯山。我军突破此一敌制高点后长驱挺进，把一六五旅及一二三旅各劈成两股，随即直取敌师部，劈破敌指挥中心，再进而把一六五旅及一二三旅各劈成数小块，然后分块包围歼灭。残敌于八日晚夺路南逃，被我军沿路截击追击，终于九日晚在王庄镇及以南义井地区为我预伏部队及追击部队再次包围歼击，两日间共毙伤俘敌官兵九千余人，残余敌人乘黑夜狼狈溃逃。
    此役我军步炮协同密切，战斗动作勇猛熟练，各线指挥员机智灵活，高度发扬了猛攻猛冲猛追的战斗作风，这证明我军在夏季整训中，全军指战员阶级觉悟的愈益提高，战术及技术上都有了飞跃的进步，因此在我军出师的第一回合，就使号称胡匪三大主力之一的整三十六师，毫无还手之力的又一次遭受被歼被俘的命运；其他各路敌莫不望风披靡，纷纷溃逃，我军乃乘胜收复邰、澄、＠三县城。
    此次反击大捷后，不但更进一步的巩固了我黄龙山新解放区，同时，也有力的打击了胡匪进扰我豫西解放区的阴谋，配合了我中原解放军为解放全中原而战的斗争。
