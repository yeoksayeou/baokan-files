Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Reports from various sources: The Kuomintang government's Executive Yuan issued an "order" to various localities on the 17th of this month to carry out frantic arrests, reiterating the prohibition of workers' strikes, student strikes, parades, petitions, and patriotic and democratic propaganda in oral or written form; the "order" stipulated that when making arrests, "residences or other places may be searched directly even without a search warrant" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th). After this "order" was issued, the Nanjing enemy's "Higher Special Criminal Court" immediately issued summonses on the 18th to arrest 179 people, including students and people from all walks of life; the Peiping enemy's "Special Criminal Court" also issued summonses to eleven universities and colleges in Peiping on the 19th to arrest 250 people, and 33 people were arrested that night (Agence France-Presse, Peiping, 19th). Before this reactionary "order" was issued, according to a TASS report on July 30th: In the week of late July, the enemy's Songhu Garrison Headquarters arrested 123 people in Shanghai, including people from cultural circles, scientists, workers, and civil servants.

It is generally believed that this open and large-scale fascist terror against people of all strata by the Kuomintang reactionaries marks the growing strength of patriotic and democratic forces in their ruling areas and the deepening crisis of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. Thus, the so-called "constitutional cabinet," which the American reactionaries once applauded, has had to tear off its "constitutional" mask and expose its fascist features once again before the world.

　　国民党反动派法西斯原形毕露
  　疯狂逮捕爱国人士
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方消息：国民党政府行政院于本月十七日向各地发出进行疯狂逮捕的“命令”，重申禁止工人罢工，学生罢课、游行、请愿、以及用口头或文字进行爱国民主宣传；“命令”中规定进行逮捕时，“虽无搜索证亦得径行搜索住宅，或其他处所”（中央社南京十七日电）。此一“命令”发出后，南京敌“高等特种刑事法院”随即于十八日发出传票，进行逮捕一百七十九人，其中包括学生及各阶层人士；北平敌“特种刑事法庭”，十九日亦向平市十一大学及专科学校发出传票，进行逮捕二百五十人，当晚即捕去三十三人（法新社北平十九日讯）。此一反动“命令”发出前，据塔斯社七月三十日消息：七月下旬一周内，敌淞沪警备司令部即在上海逮捕一百二十三人，其中包括文化界、科学家、工人及公务员等。
    一般认为：国民党反动派这一公开的、大规模的对各阶层人民的法西斯恐怖，正标志着其统治区域内爱国民主力量的日益壮大，与国民党反动统治危机的日益深刻，因而使美国反动派曾为之喝彩的所谓“行宪内阁”，不得不撕下其“行宪”面幕，在全世界面前又一次暴露其法西斯原形。
