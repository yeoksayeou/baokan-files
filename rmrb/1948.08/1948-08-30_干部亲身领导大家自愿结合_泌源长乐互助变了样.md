【Taiyue News】In Chang Le Village, District One of Qinyuan, there were originally two mutual aid groups, each with eighteen or nineteen people. Every morning, they would first gather in the village before going to the fields. Some were early, some were late, some arrived, some didn't. At the earliest, they wouldn't get to the fields until the sun was up. They were slow to start in the morning, but quick to rest in the evening. As soon as the sun went down, they considered the work done. They would rest once in the morning, and twice each in the afternoon and evening, for a total of five breaks a day. After working like this for a period of time, they averaged only half a mu of plowing per person per day, and even that wasn't done well. The land they had plowed five days ago was already full of weeds again five days later. The group leader, Cui Maotian, didn't participate in labor at all, only giving orders. No one checked whether the group members were doing well or not. In Zhang Guancheng's group, the leader often went home, saying he had things to do. As soon as he left, everyone would rest, and as a result, they couldn't even plow half a mu of land. Guancheng himself only planted one mu of grain, which was overgrown with weeds taller than the seedlings. The masses complained, saying, "Mutual aid is worse than no mutual aid. We provide money and food, but the land is still neglected. It doesn't add up!" The work records of the mutual aid group were a complete mess. Those who worked long hours didn't get paid, and those who worked short hours left the mutual aid group without repaying their labor. They didn't work hard unless they ate well. They demanded yellow steamed buns in the morning and white noodles for lunch. Among the cadres, besides the irresponsible ones, there were also some who could play a role and take responsibility. Deputy District Chief Wei understood the actual situation and convened a meeting of activists to review past mistakes: (1) Cadres did not personally participate in leadership, and the work was left to drift. (2) The work style was undemocratic, bureaucratic, and based on command. Cadres only ordered everyone to go here and there. (3) Problems were not dealt with. Long hours and short hours, advantages and disadvantages, were all left unresolved. In response to past mistakes, everyone decided on the following measures for the future: (1) Cadres should personally lead and promote the conscious and voluntary combination of the masses into mutual aid groups. Absolutely no coercion if people are unwilling to participate. (2) Clear old accounts. Those who worked short hours should repay their labor (or pay for it), and new work records should be established. (3) We should eat what the masses eat, and no special treatment should be allowed. Those who don't want to eat at other people's homes can go home to eat. (4) Daily work should be conscious and automatic, and work should be evaluated by points. Those who arrive late in the morning should be criticized and have points deducted. Ten points a day, with those lacking labor power rated at nine or eight points, etc. (5) Work should be planned, and whoever's needs are most urgent should be helped first. The day before, everyone should be told which field to go to, and everyone should go to the field in the morning without gathering in the village. (6) For convenience, the mutual aid group should be divided into smaller groups of three or four people, who can find compatible people to form a group. The overall leadership rests with the mutual aid group. After the meeting, everyone's enthusiasm was aroused. District cadres also personally participated in the mutual aid group and worked together. The group led by activist Wang Xiaoman divided ten people into two subgroups. Bai Tianyi led a children's mutual aid group, working enthusiastically. Li Linquan organized a transportation mutual aid group, using four people and nine donkeys for transportation, which saved labor and made money. The mutual aid group's dividends and labor payments were handled appropriately, and everyone was very motivated. Seeing that mutual aid was good, Hu Dayuan also joined with three people and seven donkeys to do the same, saving labor and making money. Seeing that the men's mutual aid was doing well, the women also became active. Of the seventy-two women in the village, fifty-eight young and middle-aged women, except for the elderly, participated in mutual aid groups. At this time, military shoes were needed, a total of fifty-four pairs for the whole village. The troops were also passing through. The reception station was very busy. They divided the work: those who could make military shoes specialized in making military shoes (one pair of shoes was worth eight work points), those who wanted to go to the reception station went to the reception station, and those who wanted to go to the fields still hoed the seedlings. The reception station was well-managed. The fifty-four pairs of military shoes were completed in seven days, looking good and durable. The district praised them as model shoes for the entire district. Bai Tianyi's children's mutual aid group, with seven people, hoed sixty-two mu of seedlings in twenty days from the sixth to the twenty-sixth day of the fifth lunar month. After hoeing their own, they also went to Beiyuan Village to work and earned one dou and one sheng of wages in rice. People said, "These little devils are more reliable than us!" The entire village was very enthusiastic about production and supporting the front. (Su Liang, Wang Huanlin, Fan Liang)

　　干部亲身领导大家自愿结合
  　泌源长乐互助变了样
    【太岳讯】沁源一区长乐村原来有两个互助小组，每组十八九个人，每天早上先在村里聚齐，然后才去地。你早我迟，你到我不到，每天进地至早也在太阳出来。早上动弹的迟，晚上却休息的早，日头一落，便算完工。早上要歇一回，上午下午各歇二回，一共每天要歇五回。这样干了一个时期，平均每人每天锄地半亩，锄的还不好，前五天刚锄过，后五天又是满地草。小组长崔茂田根本不参加劳动，只是指挥指挥，组员干得好坏，也没人检查。张管成那一组，组长常回家，说家里有事，他一回去，大家便休息，结果连半亩地都锄不了。管成自己只种着一亩谷，还荒成草比苗高。群众都埋怨说：“互助不如不互助，出上钱，管上饭，把地还荒了，真没帐算！”互助组的工帐是一片糊涂帐。长下工的得不到工资，短下工的离开互助组，不还工。做活是非吃好的不好好干。要求早上吃黄蒸，晌午吃白面。干部中除了不负责的以外，还有些是能起作用，负责任的。卫副区长了解了实际情况，于是召开了一个积极分子会议，检讨过去的错误：（一）干部不亲身参加领导，工作自流。（二）作风不民主，官僚主义，命令方式。干部只指挥大家去这里到那里。（三）有问题不处理。长工短工，便宜吃亏一搁了事。针对着过去错误，大家定出今后办法：（一）干部亲身领导，推动群众自觉自愿的结合互助组。大家不愿参加时绝不强制。（二）清算旧帐，短工的还工（或出工钱），另立新工帐。（三）群众吃甚咱吃甚，不能特殊。不愿到旁人家吃饭的，自己回家吃饭也行。（四）每天的工作要自觉自动，实行按工评分，早上来迟的，除批评外，扣分。一天十分，劳力不够的评九分八分不等。（五）作工要有计划，谁家要紧就先给谁家做。该到哪个地里，前一天便告与大家，早上各人都往地里走，不用在村聚齐。（六）为了便利，把互助组再划成小组，或三人，或四人，自找对劲的人碰组，总的领导归互助组。开会以后，大家的积极性都发动起来了。区干部也亲身参加了互助组，一块干起来。积极分子王小曼领导的一组，十个人分成两小组。白天意领导一个儿童互助组，起劲的干。李林全组织起运输互助组，用四个人赶着九个毛驴搞运输，又省工，又赚钱。互助组分红，出工钱，都适当处理，大家搞的很有劲。胡大元一看互助好，也结合了三个人，赶了七个毛驴干起来，一样省工赚钱。妇女看见男子汉互助得好，也动起来。全村七十二个女人，除了老太婆外，有五十八个青壮年妇女参加互助组。这时军鞋下来，全村五十四双。部队又正在过往。招待站十分繁忙。她们就分了工：会作军鞋的专作军鞋（一双鞋顶八个工），愿去招待站的到招待站，愿上地的仍然锄苗去。招待站搞得好。军鞋做了七天，五十四双如数完成，做的又好看，又坚固，区上表扬为全区的模范鞋。白天意的儿童互助组七个人，自阴历五月六日至二十六日二十天内，锄苗六十二亩。把自己的锄完，还到北园村拦工赚了工资米一石一斗。人们都说：“小鬼们比咱们还算话！”全村生产支前都很起劲。（苏良、王焕林、凡亮）
