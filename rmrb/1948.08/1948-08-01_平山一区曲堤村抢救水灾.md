    Qu Diqu Village, Pingshan First District, Rescues from Flood Disaster
    [Our Newspaper] In this heavy rain, Qu Diqu Village, Pingshan First District, suffered flooding on a total of 1,050 mu of land, including 500 mu of garden and irrigated land, 250 mu of ditch land, and 300 mu of beach land. 456 houses collapsed, leaving 34 households without shelter. Village cadres, after attending a meeting in the district on the 24th, immediately held an emergency discussion, avoiding any time-wasting meetings. The militia company organized the entire village's labor force into 24 groups, more than 200 people, led by village cadres who divided the work to make a concentrated effort. In a little over a day, they dug over two li of drainage ditches and temporarily shored up the houses that had not completely collapsed to prevent further damage. After digging ditches and repairing houses, they concentrated their efforts on smashing the leaking entrances of the tunnels, which was largely completed by the afternoon of the 25th. On the 26th, they turned to hoeing the dry fields (the flooded fields could not yet be cultivated). This reporter inspected the area with village cadres on the afternoon of the 25th and saw that digging ditches to drain water had saved over a hundred mu of crops that were about to be submerged. However, the drainage ditches in the southeast of the village were not connected to the river or canal, and there was still a risk if there were continuous heavy rains. The remaining three or more qing of irrigated land still had about a foot of rainwater, and the crops had died. The crops in the ditch land were mostly buried by mountain floods mixed with sand. The two qing of paddy fields that were once flooded had been drained, but if the Gongyi Canal could not be repaired and water supplied within ten days, they would still die from drought. Villagers are now going in groups to the upper reaches to vigorously repair the canal, carrying shovels. A small portion of the irrigated land where crops have already died can be used to grow vegetables, and most will be reserved for planting wheat. The village has 41 qing and 79 mu of dry land, most of which was sown before the rain. Due to the drought, some seedlings of millet and cotton are missing, and a small number of severely affected seedlings have died by 60-70%. As of the 25th, more than ten households had replanted more than ten mu of buckwheat in the areas with many missing seedlings. In addition, there were ten or so mu of dry land that had not yet been sown as of the 25th. Among them, more than two mu were originally owned by landlord Hao Ming, who had swapped land and left it uncultivated, and the other few mu belonged to poor peasants who lacked labor and seeds and had not yet sown them. It is hoped that these uncultivated lands will be completely eliminated in this sowing.

    平山一区曲堤村抢救水灾
    【本报讯】平山一区曲堤村在这次大雨中，共淹地一千零五十亩，其中有园子地水浇地五百亩，沟地二百五十亩，滩地三百亩。房屋倒塌四百五十六间，三十四户已无房住。村干于二十四日在区开会后，立即紧急讨论，避免任何耽误时间的会议，由中队部组织全村劳动力二十四组、二百余人，由村干分工带领突击，一天多即挖顺水沟约二里多，并将尚未全毁之房屋暂时支架好不致再倒。挖沟、修房完了，即集中力量砸漏水之地道口，二十五日下午已大致完毕，二十六日即转入抢锄旱田（水地还不能耕）。记者二十五日午与村干沿地视察，看见挖沟泄水抢救了即将淹死的庄稼百亩以上，但村东南一带之泄水沟未通至河、渠，再有连阴大雨恐仍不保险。其余三顷多水浇地尚有一尺上下雨水，庄稼已死，沟地庄稼大部被山洪夹砂淤没；一度被水淹没的两顷稻田已撤水，但十天后如不能修好公义渠浇上水，则仍将旱死；村民现正成群扛锨赴上游大力抢修渠道。庄稼已被淹死之水浇地小部分可种菜，大部将留种小麦。该村有旱田四十一顷七十九亩，雨前绝大部分已播种。谷、棉等因天旱，一部分缺苗，少数严重的旱死禾苗十分之六七。至二十五日十余户已在缺苗多的地上分片补种荞麦十余亩。另有十来亩旱地至二十五日仍未播种。其中有二亩多系原地主郝明抽换后未种荒了的，另外几亩是贫农的，因缺劳力种籽还未播种，希望在这次播种中完全消灭了这些荒地。
