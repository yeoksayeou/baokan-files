　　U.S.-Japanese Reactionaries Attack Japanese Youth
    Mayevskiy
    For decades, the Japanese reactionaries have been instilling narrow nationalism and bestial barbarism in Japanese youth. Japanese militarists poisoned the minds of young people with fanatical emperor worship, using them as tools to realize their so-called "New Order" construction plan for Asia.

    To maintain their reactionary rule in Japan, the United States and Japanese militarists paid special attention to the youth. Whether Japanese youth receive democratic education or are raised by new oppressors and butchers is of great importance to Japan's future. It will determine whether Japan becomes a democratic country or an "anti-communist" fortress, threatening world peace and security. To make Japan assume the task of an "anti-communist" fortress, the reactionaries are carrying out a wide range of "spiritual education" for the youth, making them spiritually decadent and morally degraded, alienating them from the democratic movement, and turning them into blindly obedient puppets—whether they blindly believe in emperor worship or the omnipotence of money. In the ideological scraps that the apostles of "democracy" in Japan instill in Japanese youth, there is everything from the promotion of "Americanism" and pornography to revenge and anti-Soviet slander—everything that is useful to them. Under the banner of "Americanization," reactionary propaganda organs are active everywhere, hindering young people from extricating themselves from the oppressive spiritual poverty imposed by Japanese militarists. These propaganda organs consist of films, publications, radio broadcasts, schools, and churches.

    Since the day the U.S. military occupied Japan, Hollywood films have been flowing into Japan in a continuous stream. These films are full of stories of murder and robbery, sickening jazz music, the licentious "tragedies" of millionaire families, the "chance encounters" between unscrupulous speculators and elderly wealthy women, followed by robbery and murder. American film companies bring all their garbage to Japan, even including silent films from the 1920s. Japanese film enterprises, unable to withstand the heavy blows of Hollywood, have to imitate the American style, "adding" some American shots. However, the direct result of learning the ways of Hollywood's robber barons is an increase in the number of crimes among Japanese students.

    Publications are attacking Japan alongside films. In November of last year alone, the Japanese Ministry of Education allocated four and a half tons of American books and magazines, including "literary works," to middle schools and universities. American detective novels and adventure stories have long been placed alongside harmful fascist "literature" from Japan and abroad, filling the shelves of bookstores. This kind of fascist "literature" has never been removed from bookstores since the U.S. military occupied Japan, and has not even been removed from the library of the largest Tokyo Imperial University. However, how many times has the issue of "eradicating" the hotbeds of militarism and fascism been discussed? Under the influence of "classical" Barmec detective novels, a large number of similar Japanese detective novels have emerged, and these things are now being vigorously promoted and rewarded as the "spiritual food" of Japanese youth.

    Japanese reactionary newspapers and magazines are full of tiresome yellow journalism. In these newspapers, yellow journalism accounts for 25 to 40 percent. For example, in October of last year, newspapers were full of news, photos, and interviews with Sekine, a famous Japanese master thief who had been arrested by the police. At the same time, they published malicious rumors about the Japanese Communist Party and foreign democratic movements. The U.S. occupying forces take a lenient attitude towards reactionary publications, while suppressing democratic newspapers, especially the Communist Party's organ "Akahata." American radio stations broadcast a jumble of jazz music, prayers, international news from the Hearst news agency, and "latest news" full of nauseating words. Japanese broadcasting is increasingly imitating the tone of its American masters. The Japanese "stage" is compiling American-style programs, full of ugly dances by ordinary "girls," vulgar singers, and sickening jazz music. These "excellent works" are unique toxins that poison the human spirit and stimulate people's most base instincts.

    Japanese militarists regarded schools as the most powerful means of constantly influencing young people. Establishing a democratic education system is one of the basic links in the various means necessary to build a democratic Japan. Japanese leaders, following the advice of American "experts" and supported by MacArthur's headquarters, implemented the "decentralization" of the education system, that is, handing over schools to local government organs; however, reactionary elements—capitalists, landlords, bureaucrats—often play a dominant role in local government organs, and they still do so now. Although the issue of education reform has been noisy for two years, everything is still taught in schools based on textbooks with content based on emperor worship and militarism.

    A large number of demobilized officers are hidden in universities and general schools, instilling revengeful ideas in young people. For example, at the University of Sapporo, propaganda is being carried out in various ways: falsely claiming that Japan fought for "sublime ideals," and that Japan's military and political leaders were only guilty of failing to complete the tasks they had undertaken, being defeated, and "insulting the Emperor's name." The phenomenon of worshiping the Emperor still exists now, and in fact, not only the Japanese government adopts a tolerant attitude towards it, but the U.S. occupying forces also tolerate it.

    The government agencies' laissez-faire attitude has helped the existence of Japanese militarist terrorist groups. These terrorist groups first pay close attention to attracting young people. In January of last year, two young men from the so-called "New Elite Masses Party" terrorist group attempted to assassinate Tatsuki Tokuda, chairman of the Japanese Congress of Industrial Unions. On the other hand, American magazines publish photos of the Crown Prince enjoying feeding chickens as evidence of Japan's "demilitarization."

    When Japanese imperialists carried out aggressive adventures, Japan's national religion—Shinto—made a great contribution to the war by "spiritually mobilizing" the people. Although Shinto has now been abolished in schools, it is still a powerful means of influencing young people due to the machinations of many reactionary elements hidden in the spirits. The influence of Catholic churches is increasing unprecedentedly. They spread anti-Soviet slanders and malicious attacks on democracy, even more diligently than they promote Christian gentleness.

    All of the above does not fully describe the unbridled ideological education of youth carried out daily by the Japanese reactionaries under the protection of MacArthur, who have been driving young people to serve the instigators of new wars. However, the crazy actions of the Japanese reactionaries are not evidence of their strength, but rather evidence of their weakness and loss of confidence.

    In fact, Japan's defeat in World War II has told millions of Japanese people how cruelly the ruling group and the Emperor, who was called a "god," deceived them. The war brought nothing but unprecedented poverty and the hatred of people all over the world. In this way, great changes cannot but occur in the ideological consciousness of the masses. The Japanese democratic movement, regardless of the overt or covert oppression of the American and Japanese authorities, is developing and strengthening day by day. The strike movement is expanding, and hundreds of thousands of working people are appearing on the streets of cities, demanding improved living conditions and the establishment of a truly democratic government. The same movement is also rising in the countryside.

    The outstanding elements of Japanese youth are enthusiastically participating in the democratic movement of the working people. Young people are joining the Communist Party in large numbers, and the ranks of the Young Communist League are expanding. These young men and women are fighting to prevent U.S. imperialism from colonizing Japan. They are truly fighting to build a democratic Japan.

　　美日反动派进攻日本青年
    马耶夫斯基
    数十年来，日本的反动派总在灌输青年以狭隘的民族主义与兽性的野蛮思想。日本的军国主义者以狂热的天皇主义毒素，毒害着青年的意识，借此使青年充当其实现所谓建设亚洲“新秩序”的强盗计划的工具。
    为了维持日本的反动统治，美国与日本的军国主义者特别注意到青年身上。日本青年究竟在受民主主义的教育，抑或为新的压迫者与屠夫所教养，关系日本的前途甚大。因为它将决定日本将成为民主国家，或者成为“反共”堡垒，威胁全世界的和平与安全。反动派为了要日本担负“反共”堡垒的任务，正在对青年展开广泛的“精神教育”，使青年精神颓废，道德沦丧，使他们远离民主运动，而成为盲从的傀儡——不论是迷信天皇主义也好，或是迷信金元万能也好。在日本“民主主义”使徒灌输给日本青年的思想残渣中，从宣传“美国主义”与色情狂，一直到复仇心和反苏诽谤，凡是对他们有用的可说应有尽有。在“美国化”的招牌下，反动的宣传机关到处在活动，阻碍着青年从被日本军国主义者逼人的精神贫困状态中自拔起来。而构成此种宣传机关的，则是电影、出版、无线电广播、学校及教会等等。
    从美军占领日本的那一天起，好莱坞影片即源源不绝地流入日本。在这些影片中，充满着杀人与强盗故事，令人作呕的爵士音乐、荒淫无耻的百万富翁之家庭“悲剧”、专事投机的无耻之徒与老迈的富翁夫人姘度的“巧遇”，随后又是强盗和杀人。美国的电影公司把所有的废物都带到日本来，甚至包括本世纪二十年代的无声电影。日本的影片企业不堪好莱坞的沉重打击，也不得不仿效美国样式，“增添”一些美国镜头。但是学习好莱坞的强盗头子作风的直接结果，却在日本学生中增加了犯罪的数目。
    与影片并驾齐驱袭击日本的，则是出版物。仅仅在去年十一月，日本文部省即分配给中学与大学四吨半的美国书籍杂志，其中包括“文学作品”。美国的侦探小说与冒险小说集，老早以前即与日本及外国的有害的法西斯“文学”并列一起，摆满了书店的柜头。此种法西斯“文学”自美军占领日本以来，从未被从书店中清除，甚至也还没有从最大的东京帝大的图书馆中清除。然而关于“根绝”军国主义与法西斯主义温床，不是被议论过多少遍吗？在“古典”的舶麦的侦探小说之影响下，与此相似的大批日本侦探小说应运而生，这些东西今天正在作为日本青年的“精神食粮”，被极力推崇与奖励着。
    日本的反动报纸和杂志，充满着令人厌烦的黄色新闻。在这些报纸中，黄色新闻占了百分之二十五到百分之四十。例如去年十月，报纸上满载着被警察逮捕的有名的日本盗魁关根的新闻、照片和访问记。与此同时，则发表对日本共产党及外国民主运动的恶意造谣。美占领军对反动的出版物采取宽大态度，同时却压迫民主主义的报纸，特别是共产党的机关报“赤旗”。美国广播电台则乱七八糟的放送些爵士音乐、祈祷与赫斯特系通讯社的国际新闻，以及充满了肉麻话的“最近新闻”。而日本的广播则日益模仿其美国主子的腔调。日本的“舞台”则编成美国式的戏目，尽是普通“女孩子”的难看的跳舞、下流歌商和令人发呕的爵士音乐。这些“优秀作品”乃是毒害人类精神、刺激人们最卑鄙的本能之特有的毒素。
    日本军国主义者把学校视为经常影响青年的最有力的手段。建立民主的教育体系，是建设民主日本必要的各种手段中的基本环节之一。日本的首脑分子遵从美国“专家”的忠告，得到麦克阿瑟总部的支援，实行教育体系的“地方分权”，即交学校移交地方政权机关管制；但是在地方政权机关中，反动的成份——资本家、地主、官僚却经常扮演着统治的角色，现在亦仍然如此。关于教育改革问题虽然已经喧嚷了两年，但在学校中，仍在依据天皇主义、军国主义内容的教科书，讲授一切学科。
    大批复员将校隐身于大学和一般学校中，灌输青年以复仇思想。例如在札幌的大学里，正在以各种方法进行宣传：妄称日本乃是为了“高超的理想”而作战，日本的军事政治指导者仅仅由于其未完成他们所担负的任务，战败了，“污辱了天皇的名誉”，故有罪。崇拜天皇的现象现在仍然存在着，事实上不仅日本政府对此采取容忍态度，即美占领军当局也是同样对其容忍宽大。
    政府机关的放任态度，帮助了日本军国主义恐怖团体的存在。此种恐怖团体首先十分注意到拉拢青年。去年一月，所谓“新锐大众党”的恐怖集团的两个青年，曾企图暗杀日本产联主席涛克已。另方面美国杂志则登载正在喂鸡取乐的皇太子的照片，作为日本“非军事化”的证据。
    当日本帝国主义者进行侵略冒险时，日本的国家宗教——神道，曾在“精神动员”人民上，对战争起了巨大的贡献，现在虽然在学校里已经废除了神道，但由于很多隐身于精神中的反动分子的作祟，神道依然成为影响青年的有力手段。天主教堂的影响力正在空前的增大着，它们散播反苏诽谤与对民主主义的恶毒中伤，比其宣传基督教的温顺尤为努力。
    所有以上并未能说明日本反动派每天在麦克阿瑟的庇护下所进行的、曾在驱使青年服务的新战争挑拨者的肆无忌惮的青年思想教育的全貌。然而日本反动派如此疯狂的行动，并不是他们力量强大的证据，恰恰相反，却是他们力量软弱，丧失自信的证据。
    事实上，日本在二次世界大战的失败，已经告诉了千百万日本人，说明统治集团与被称为“神”的天皇是如何残忍地欺骗他们。战争除了使日本人陷于空前贫困与遭受全世界人民的憎恶外，一无所获。这样，在人民大众的思想意识中，就不能不发生巨大的变化。日本的民主主义运动，不顾美国当局与日本当局或明或暗的压迫，正在日趋发展与强大。罢工运动日益扩大，数十万劳动人民出现于都市街头，要求改善生活与建立真正的民主政府。同样的运动也在农村中兴起。
    而日本青年的优秀分子，正在热烈地参加劳动人民的民主主义运动。青年们纷纷加入共产党，青年共产主义同盟的队伍日趋扩大。这些青年男女们正在为防止美帝国主义殖民地化日本而斗争。他们真正在为建设民主的日本而斗争着。
