    [Taihang Electric] The election of people's representatives in Taihang has been successfully completed in various counties and cities with a serious and prudent spirit after intense work. On the 27th of last month, all representatives gathered in Changzhi City and formally formed a delegation. According to reports from more than ten counties and cities, including Shexian, Changzhi, Lucheng, Pingshun, Wuxiang, Cixian, Gaoyi, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Changzhi City, and Xingtai City, although the election of representatives was conducted during the busy production season, each county and city established a preparatory committee and, with a certain amount of effort, adopted necessary measures to carry out relatively in-depth publicity and preparatory work. Wuxiang, Neiqiu, and other counties, while organizing publicity, collected opinions from all strata of the masses on political, economic, and cultural construction. Shexian, Wuxiang, Cixian, and other places discussed the qualifications of representatives in detail, and the election was extremely cautious. At the joint election meetings of Party, government, military, people's organizations, business circles, local notables, enlightened gentry, and representatives of ethnic minorities held successively in various counties and cities, the representatives first studied and discussed the situation and tasks of the North China Liberated Area, and from their own interests and work needs, recognized the great significance of this election and the necessity of establishing the North China People's Government. During the discussion among the representatives of Shexian, representative Hao Puhou said: "Businessmen have long hoped for the unification of North China. After unification, it will be convenient to purchase goods and sell mountain products." Some representatives said: "After the unification of North China, various constructions can be strengthened, and we can strive for the early arrival of national victory." During the discussion, nominations were brewed, and then formal representatives were elected by secret ballot. Bai Peheng from Zhangnan and Pang Jia from Changzhi County were both elected as representatives with unanimous votes. After the formal representatives were elected in various places, they discussed and prepared various proposals in detail. Xingtai City submitted 70 proposals, including 10 on economic construction, 9 on culture and education, 6 on transportation construction, 10 on women's issues, 12 on supply and treatment, 5 on social undertakings and public security, 5 on burdens, and 13 others. Business representatives also submitted 47 proposals. Among them, problems to be solved in the city's work were suggested to the municipal government for research and implementation. Those related to the entire North China were submitted to the conference for discussion. In the presentation of various proposals, everyone proceeded from the actual situation in various places and focused on the long-term interests of the people, conducting repeated discussions to make the proposals more substantial and perfect. The most important and universal of all kinds of proposals was the unanimous request to quickly establish a unified people's government in North China, to uniformly lead various production and construction undertakings, to promulgate various unified decrees, to establish a democratic life in rural areas, to protect the interests of the people, and to uniformly support the national people's liberation war, in order to strive for an early victory for the whole country. After this election of representatives, the counties not only elected representatives who truly represent the people to attend the conference, and widely gathered the opinions of the masses from all strata, but also appropriately inspected the implementation of various policies in the counties in the past six months, and promoted the work in various places. And through this election, the political enthusiasm of the masses in various places was encouraged. The masses in Shexian, Gaoyi, and other counties proposed: "In order to celebrate the success of the election, we must further develop the large-scale production movement and strive for victory on the production front to celebrate the opening of the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference."
