    Hearing of the Impending Attack on Taiyuan, the Masses Cheer; Civilians in Pingding Vigorously Support the Front

    [North Yue News] After the news of the attack on Taiyuan reached Pingding, the broad masses cheered wildly. On the evening of July 21st, the county received an order from the sub-district to gather civilian laborers. County cadres braved the rain that night, wading through mountain floods that reached their thighs, to gather civilian laborers in each district. Upon hearing that Taiyuan was about to be attacked, the civilian laborers prepared their belongings for departure overnight, and the women busied themselves making dry rations for the men. Wang Xiaosan from Shangzhangzhao Village said, "It's raining, and we're also going to capture Yan Xishan alive. These are two happy events! The land is being taken care of by the women and the elderly, and we're willing to come back after the autumn harvest." Wang Changshou and Wang Niuxiao, who were over sixty years old, said, "You go ahead, we'll take care of things at home. We can work in the fields and repair roads, each of us doing our part." Within two days, the 22nd and 23rd, they had gathered a stretcher team of 2,340 people and a transportation team of 660 livestock. The civilian laborers gathered in the county, jumping and shouting excitedly, "Attack Taiyuan!" "Capture Yan Xishan!" Before leaving, the county held a mobilization meeting, calling on everyone to strive to be model squads, model platoons, and individual models, ensuring swift action and adherence to discipline; not complaining or deserting in the face of difficulties; and helping the masses with production in their spare time. Everyone responded unanimously, and districts and squads spontaneously initiated challenge competitions. The Fourth Squad and the Second Squad challenged each other, stating: "In addition to resolutely implementing the instructions of the superiors, we must also bring back a certificate of completion. We must be as tough as steel and not be soft as mud. We will not go home until the task is completed." (Cheng Yuzhen, Ren × Tian, Guo Shimin, Ren Zhigui, Lian Fu)

    听说要打太原群众欢欣鼓舞
    平定民工奋勇支前
    【北岳讯】打太原的消息传到平定后，广大群众欢呼若狂。该县于七月二十一日晚，接到分区集中民工的命令，县干部当晚就冒着雨，冲过深及腿根的山洪急流，到各区集中民工。听说要打太原，民工们连夜准备出发的东西，妇女们忙着给男人们烧干粮。上章召村王小三说：“下了雨，又要活捉阎锡山，这真是两件高兴事，土地有妇女老汉们照顾，收秋回来也愿意”。六十多岁的王长寿和王牛小说：“你们走吧，家里的事有我们照料，闹庄稼、修马路都行，咱们各干各的。”在二十二、二十三两天内，就集中起二千三百四十人的担架队，六百六十头牲口的运输队。民工们集中到县里，兴奋的跳着、蹦着，叫着：“打太原呀！”“捉阎锡山呀！”临走时县上召开了动员大会，号召大家争取模范连、模范排和个人模范，保证作到动作迅速、遵守纪律；遇困难不讲怪话，不开小差；抽空帮助群众生产。大家便一致响应，区与区、连与连自动发起挑战竞赛。四连与二连挑战提出：“除坚决执行上级号召的条件外，并一定要带回完成任务证来，要当钢铁硬骨，不做稀泥软蛋；不完成任务不回家”。（程玉珍、任×田、郭世民、任之贵、连福）
