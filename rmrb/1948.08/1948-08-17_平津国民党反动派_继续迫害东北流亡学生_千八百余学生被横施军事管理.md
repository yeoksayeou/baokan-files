Xinhua News Agency, North China, 14th—According to reports in the Tianjin Dagong Bao on July 7th, 8th, and 18th: After the "July 5th" massacre, Northeastern students stranded in Beiping and Tianjin continue to live a miserable existence under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In Tianjin, over 1,800 students taken into the so-called "Northeast Temporary Middle School" live in a dilapidated factory, without desks or chairs, sleeping on the floor. There are no teachers, and no classes are held. Furthermore, the Kuomintang has imposed military management on these students, organized according to infantry divisions; the school's student self-government association has been dissolved. Another group of students who arrived in Tianjin in mid-July could not be accommodated by the "Temporary Middle School," and the Kuomintang municipal government only provides them with two cornbread buns each day. In Beiping, two students have already gone insane. Liu Wensheng, a student in the preparatory class of Jinzhou University, who lived in Guanghua Temple in Beiping, sold all his belongings in mid-July and then ran around the courtyard, shouting "Darkness! Darkness!" "Democracy! Democracy!" for two hours. His classmates helped him into the room to rest, but he soon began to shout wildly again; on July 16th, he was sent to a mental hospital, but was refused admission due to a lack of guarantor and medical expenses. Another Northeastern student, Wu Ying, also suffered a mental breakdown due to severe trauma. Xu Guochang, Li Fuwei, and Bu Hongxun, who were wounded in the "July 5th" incident and died in a Beiping hospital, were left unburied for three days in the hot weather because no one would pay for coffins.

　　平津国民党反动派
    继续迫害东北流亡学生
  　千八百余学生被横施军事管理
    【新华社华北十四日电】据天津大公报七月七日、八日及十八日披露：“七、五”惨案后，流落在平、津的东北学生继续在国民党反动派的压迫下，过着悲惨的日子。在天津，被收容入所谓“东北临时中学”的一千八百余学生，住在一所破烂的工厂里，无桌无椅，席地而卧，既无教员，更不上课。而国民党复按步兵编制，将这些学生实行军事管理；该校自治会已被解散。七月中旬抵达天津的另一批学生，因“临中”收容不下，仅由国民党市府每日发给两个窝窝头。在北平已有学生两人发疯。住在北平广化寺内的锦州大学先修班学生刘文生，于七月中旬将身边所有物品变卖一空后，即在院子里乱跑乱跳，高喊“黑暗！黑暗！”“民主！民主！”达两小时，同学扶他进屋内休息，但不久又狂呼起来；七月十六日被送入精神病院时，因缺乏铺保及医药费而被拒绝收容。另一东北学生吴英，亦因深受刺激而神经错乱。在“七、五”中弹受伤死在北平医院的许国昌、李福维、卜洪勋三人，因无人出钱买棺材，在炎热天气中停尸三日未殓。
