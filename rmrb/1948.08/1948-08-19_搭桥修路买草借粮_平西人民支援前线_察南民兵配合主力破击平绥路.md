[Chahar Telegram] During the Ping-Bao Campaign, the people of various areas in western Hebei overcame various difficulties and actively supported the front lines. Before the start of the campaign, the masses in the Fangshan mountainous area happily rushed to repair mountain roads to facilitate the movement of the army. The entire village of Pian Shang mobilized all manpower to rush to build a large bridge, eight feet wide and more than ten feet long, for carts to pass. Seven carpenters refused to rest and worked overnight to make horse racks, completing the bridge repair task one day ahead of schedule. The first district of the county suffered severe drought, and the lives of the masses were very difficult. In order to ensure the supply of grain and fodder for the passing troops, the masses rushed to Wanping, Laishui, Liangxiang and other counties to buy grass and borrow grain, and organized children to cut green grass to feed the livestock. After the start of the campaign, the masses in the third and sixth districts of Laishui rushed to grind 30,000 catties of white flour overnight to supply the troops. Although the third district of Lai Zhuo was devastated by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, with nine out of ten houses empty, they were still very active in supporting the front lines. In less than ten days, they prepared all the war firewood, war grass, white flour, vegetables, etc., and each village along the way repaired roads and built tea sheds. Women organized comfort teams. Wanggezhuang in the first district immediately restored the combat production committee after the start of the battle, leading support and production separately. Women organized comfort groups to collect chicken noodles and other items to take care of the wounded and sick soldiers in a timely manner. The militia of the third district of Liangxiang concentrated overnight and cooperated with the main force to attack the Pinghan Railway, destroying 90 li of railway and more than a dozen iron bridges overnight, overturning all the sleepers, and immediately helped the troops build fortifications after completing the task, winning a banner of honor from a certain unit. More than 20 women in the sewing and washing team in Nan Jiao Village helped the troops wash 94 military uniforms, made 86 pairs of underpants, undershirts, and quilts, and mended 24 pairs of socks in two days. After the rainstorm on July 12, Zheng Da, director of the village's youth association, led 64 youths and children, carrying lanterns and torches, wading through the water, to repair the damaged mountain roads overnight. The masses were extremely enthusiastic in supporting the front.
