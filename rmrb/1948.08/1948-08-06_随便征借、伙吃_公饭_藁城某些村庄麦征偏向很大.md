    Arbitrary requisition and communal “public meals”
    Serious bias in wheat requisition in some villages in Gaocheng
    [Jizhong News] During the wheat requisition work in Gaocheng County, due to insufficient publicity and education, and inadequate specific assistance and inspection from the leadership, serious biases occurred in some villages. When requisitioning in Chetou Village, the number of wheat fields was not registered in detail, but the requisition was estimated based on the percentage of wheat fields in the total land area. Therefore, the requisition was very unfair, and some people could not pay off the amount even after handing over all the wheat they harvested. In Lizhuang Village, Second District, cadres and militiamen used the excuse of checking the crops and providing disaster relief to requisition grain from middle peasants, seriously infringing upon the interests of middle peasants; cadres and militiamen each received five large dou of wheat, essentially embezzling and eating it privately. Xiaociyi Village borrowed more than thirty bags of grain from middle peasants, all of which were embezzled, wasted, and squandered indiscriminately. Some villages also ate public meals during wheat requisition, increasing the burden on the masses. In Beixiaotun, Tenth District, more than fifty people ate three meals. After discovering these biases, the county party committee has instructed all districts to quickly correct and handle them.

    随便征借、伙吃“公饭”
    藁城某些村庄麦征偏向很大
    【冀中讯】藁城县麦征工作中，由于宣传教育不深入，领导上具体帮助检查也不够，部分村庄发生了严重的偏向。车头村征收时不详细登记麦田数，而按麦田占总地数的百分之几来估计征收，因此征收很不公平，有人将所收之麦纳完还不够。二区里庄干部民兵借口看青和赈济，向中农征借粮食，严重的侵犯了中农利益；干部民兵每人分麦五大斗、实即贪污私吃。小慈邑村借了中农三十多口袋粮食，都贪污浪费胡花乱用了。还有些村在麦征中吃公饭，增加了群众负担，十区北小屯就有五十多人吃了三顿。县委发现这些偏向后，已指示各区迅速纠正处理。
