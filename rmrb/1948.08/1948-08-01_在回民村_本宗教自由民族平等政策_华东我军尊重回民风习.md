Xinhua News Agency, Jinpu Front, 29th: On July 9th, the 1st Battalion of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army moved to Xuandi Temple between Yanzhou and Jining. This is a Hui village with six or seventy households.

The villagers were afraid when they saw troops stationed in their village because they had suffered enough at the hands of the Kuomintang army. The Kuomintang army robbed the whole village twice, in early November and on the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, taking away five or six hundred million Jiao of Chiang currency. Liu Yujin had no money and was almost burned to death by them; Ma Chengsi's leg was broken. Wang Hexuan, the village's Ahong, told the People's Liberation Army comrades, "The Kuomintang soldiers drank alcohol in the mosque." (Note: Alcohol and cigarettes are taboo for Hui people). He also pointed to the broken tiles on the roof of the mosque and said, "Look! They (referring to the Kuomintang army) used guns to shoot pigeons and broke the tiles on the temple."

After the People's Liberation Army entered the village, cultural instructor Zhao Zongyu, regardless of fatigue, wrote large slogans in the village such as "Religious Freedom," "National Equality," and "The People's Liberation Army is the People's Army, not taking a single needle or thread from the people." This matter spread quickly, and an old man told several people: "The Eighth Route Army believes in religion (meaning they do not prohibit believing in religion). Their comrades pointed at the words and said to me: This is what Chairman Mao said."

The company commander and deputy instructor specially invited the Ahong to explain to him the various policies of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and asked what Hui rules the troops needed to abide by. They also said, "When the army is stationed here, it will definitely not eat black livestock (referring to pigs) and respect local customs."

The next day, the people in the village reflected one after another: "The Eighth Route Army is really polite and reasonable. When people (referring to the People's Liberation Army) come to our village, they don't eat 'major sect' food, which gives us a lot of face and really makes them feel wronged."

When the company commander learned that the masses were discussing slaughtering sheep to comfort the army, he immediately went to the Ahong and asked them not to do so under any circumstances. The Ahong discussed it with everyone for a while and came back and said with embarrassment, "The people must comfort you; if you don't accept anything at all, it will be too disrespectful to everyone." However, the Second Company asked for instructions from higher authorities and only agreed after receiving approval.

The Ahong said to the cultural instructor, "Give us something."

"What?" the cultural instructor asked.

"The people say that the songs sung by the Eighth Route Army are very interesting. They want me to ask you to copy the song 'Comrades, I want to ask you: Where does the food we eat and the clothes we wear come from? Eating and wearing, we originally rely on the people…'"

### 在回民村  本宗教自由民族平等政策  华东我军尊重回民风习

    在回民村
    本宗教自由民族平等政策
    华东我军尊重回民风习
    【新华社津浦前线二十九日电】七月九日，解放军某团一营移驻兖州、济宁间的玄帝庙。这是一个有六、七十户人家的回民村。
    村民们看见村里住上军队，心里就害怕，因为他们早被国民党军队糟蹋够了。去年十一月初和腊月二十九日两次，全村就被国民党军队抢去五、六千万元蒋币，刘玉金没钱，差点被他们烧死；马成思被打坏腿。该村阿訇王和轩对解放军同志说：“国民党的兵在清真寺里喝过酒。”（按酒烟是回民犯忌的）。他又指着清真寺屋上的破瓦说：“你瞧！他们（指国民党军队）用枪打鸽子，把寺上的瓦也打毁了”。
    解放军进村后，文化教员赵宗瑜就不顾疲劳的在村里写“宗教自由”，“民族平等”，“解放军是人民的军队，不动人民一针一线”等大字标语。这事情立刻被传开去，一个老大爷告诉好几个人：“八路信教（即不禁止信教之意），他们的同志指着字对俺说：这是毛主席说的。”
    连长和副指导员又特地请了阿訇来，向他说明共产党和解放军的各项政策，并询问有哪些回教规矩需要部队遵守，又说：“军队驻在这里时，一定不吃黑牲口（指猪类），尊重当地风俗习惯。”
    第二天村里的人民纷纷反映：“八路真客气，讲道理。”一人家（指解放军）上咱村来，不用“大教”的菜，给咱多大面子，真叫他们受委曲了。”
    当连长知道了群众在商议宰羊慰劳军队时，他马上到阿訇那儿去，请他们无论如何不要这样做。阿訇和大家商议了一会回来很为难的说：“老百姓一定要慰劳；要是一点不收，就太不给大家面子了。”但二连请示上级得到了批准才答应下来。
    阿訇又对文化教员说：“你给咱一样东西吧。”
    “什么东西？”文化教员问。
    “老百姓说，八路唱的歌挺有意思，要我请你把那支‘同志们我要问问你：吃的饭，穿的衣，是从哪里来？吃和穿，咱本来都靠老百姓………’的歌抄给他们。”
