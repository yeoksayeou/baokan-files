Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st. According to the Jinan Cheng Bao, a Shanghai dispatch reports: Chinese sailors in Japan are subjected to all kinds of restrictions and insults by the US and Japanese authorities. The Minsheng Company's Nanhai vessel, transporting iron sand from Hainan Island to Japan under the orders of the Kuomintang traitorous government, was met with US military police upon arrival at Yawata Port, Japan. The police conveyed seven prohibitions to the crew, including that they could not carry more than one US dollar in cash ashore. The crew members were extremely angry at these prohibitions, but had to swallow their anger under the supervision of the US military police. After unloading the iron sand in Yawata, the ship sailed to Moji Port. At that time, due to the exhaustion of food supplies, a cook was sent ashore to exchange sugar and cigarettes for vegetables. Japanese military police not only confiscated the goods he was carrying, but also escorted him to the US military police headquarters. The next day, US military police boarded the ship and conducted a large-scale search, arresting five crew members and the Minsheng Company representative accompanying the ship. The remaining crew members were also placed under house arrest. The US military authorities also ordered that Japanese police be stationed on all Chinese ships docked in Moji Port for surveillance. Our fellow Chinese sailors who have been insulted are all filled with indignation.

　　国民党卖国政府媚美资日
  　中国船员在日受辱
    【新华社山东二十一日电】据济南诚报载上海通讯：中国船员在日本受到美日当局的百般限制和侮辱，奉国民党卖国政府命令运送海南岛铁砂资日的民生公司南海轮，于抵日本八幡港后，即在美宪兵监视下向船员传达上陆不得携带一元美金以上钱钞等七项禁令，该船员工对此等禁令愤慨异常，惟在美宪兵监视下只得忍气吞声。该船在八幡卸完铁砂后即转驶门司港，是时因食物告终，派一伙夫上岸以所带砂糖、香烟换蔬菜，日本宪兵不仅扣留其所携带之物资，且将其押送至美宪兵司令部，翌日美宪兵即上船大肆搜查，当将五个船员及随船之民生公司代表逮捕，其余船员亦遭软禁。美军当局并下令对所有停泊门司港之华籍船舶一律派日警驻守监视。受侮辱的我国海员同胞皆愤慨万分。
