　　Xinji Corrects Policies to Solve Practical Difficulties
　　Factories and Shops Both Increase
　　[Jizhong Electric] Since the Jizhong Industrial and Commercial Conference in March of this year, the Xinji Municipal Party Committee and various industrial and commercial departments have reviewed their past unclear guiding ideology for developing industry, as well as various deviations in the labor movement. All departments have clarified their priorities: the Municipal Party Committee should pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the labor movement, banks should focus on providing loans to support industry, and Yuhua Company should help with the supply and sales of industrial products and raw materials. After the departments divided their responsibilities, they went into various industries to provide specific assistance and leadership. In the process of providing specific assistance and leadership, many problems were discovered. For example, workers' wages in various factories were calculated based on physical goods, while capitalists' capital was calculated based on currency. When prices fluctuated, the capitalists could not protect their physical assets; some workers received too much profit sharing, which affected investment; the import of leather raw materials was not allowed, which affected the leather industry; previously, large merchants bringing drafts could not buy goods and leave, and it took half a year to process drafts at the bank, so private merchants were afraid to accept them. After these problems were discovered, they were first discussed by various industry groups, then studied by various industrial and commercial departments, and finally the Municipal Party Committee proposed solutions. In the future, factories can use main raw materials as capital, and shops can use main commodities as capital, so that capitalists can protect their raw materials and commodities and not be affected by price fluctuations. Factories can stipulate labor discipline. Public factories will have regulations discussed and stipulated by the factory director, supervisory committee, trade union, and workers. Private factories and workshops will have regulations jointly stipulated by the factory management and workers. In the future, merchants buying goods can use drafts, which will be processed by the bank, and the time will be reduced to one month. It was also stipulated that the import of specialized leather-making raw materials would be allowed. After solving these practical problems, the doubts and concerns of industrial and commercial households about trade unions and the labor movement were dispelled, and the industrial and commercial sectors and the labor movement experienced new development. Zhang Jingxian, director of the carpet industry, and Cui Keguai, manager of Baipi Leather Company, both requested that the trade union come to their factories to organize trade unions. In June and July, the city added 54 new industrial enterprises, 20 commercial enterprises, and 353 new workers. The iron industry used to stop work in July every year, but it did not stop this year. The textile industry organized a local thread straightening cooperative, which solved the problem of raw materials, produced good thread, and promoted women's weaving.

　　Workers in various factories have begun to establish new labor attitudes, which has generally increased output by two-fifths. The Julong Iron Factory used to make 15 waterwheel buckets per person per day, but now they make 20 to 30. There have also been improvements in labor-capital and teacher-apprentice relationships. For example, in the Hua Leather Factory and Yuanxing Towel Factory, workers are very careful in handling all raw materials, tools, and finished products of the factory. The factory also pays attention to the workers' lives. When workers are sick, the manager personally urges them to see a doctor. Ren Fushun, the manager of Yuanxing, also uses his spare time to teach his apprentices how to weave. There have also been great achievements in technical inventions. After toothbrush worker Zhao Qingzhong created the polishing machine and polishing machine, toothbrush production increased nine times per day. Fan Wenliang of the Minsheng Iron Factory created a tool for making wire nails, which are the same as foreign products, and the quantity has increased. Wang Pin-yi, a technician at the Wanjiju Leather Factory, used domestically produced Ruohuang to replace imported Zi and other tanning agents, saving 54,000 yuan per hide, which translates to a saving of more than 40 million yuan per month for the city, based on 788 tanned hides. Cheng Guodong, a worker at the Yufeng Paper Factory, has also successfully made toothpaste himself. In addition, the unity between public and private sectors has been strengthened, driving the private industrial sector. For example, the private Daxing Factory did not have any work for a while, so the public Julong Iron Factory suggested that it make waterwheel materials and sell them on its behalf without charging any price. During the slack season in the textile industry, the Municipal Promotion Society bought the finished products of 25 households to help them through the slack season, and also helped the Wu-Wu Socks Factory, which had already closed down, to resume operations.

　　Municipal Trade Union Does Not Grasp Tightly; A Few Managers Mistreat Workers
　　Municipal Party Committee Discovers and Pays Attention to Correction
　　However, because the city's trade union did not grasp policies firmly and the Municipal Party Committee did not conduct timely inspections, a few factory directors and managers unilaterally accepted or deliberately distorted the spirit of the industrial conference, neglecting workers' welfare and even mistreating workers. For example, Wang Bingchun, the manager of the Tongchunhao Whip Shop, scolded a worker for not following the shop rules because he drank pea porridge before meals, and did not allow the worker to eat for two meals in a row. When the worker reasoned with him, he said that the worker was destroying industry and commerce, and wanted to sue the worker to the municipal government, and drove the worker out of the factory with a stick. He refused to pay the worker's wages and even wanted to beat the worker. When the trade union resolved this issue, it only mobilized the workers to "protect industry and commerce" and to accept lower wages. As a result, 100,000 yuan in wages was owed, but only 15,000 yuan was paid, and the manager who unreasonably beat and scolded the worker did not receive any punishment. Some managers simply lowered wages and reduced workers' living standards. For example, in the Xingyuan Towel Factory, workers had already voluntarily reduced their wages by one-quarter, but the factory still wanted to reduce them further, and the practice of eating noodles once every ten days was reduced to not even once a month. The Tongfeng Towel Factory only reduced workers' wages and not employees'. The Dafeng Bow Factory reduced the wages for making a bow from 100 jin of rice to 70 jin in order to lower wages. They did not stop the work, nor did they explain it to the workers. As a result, the workers left, and now it is difficult to find workers when there is work, which affects business. (While the high-wage policy hinders industrial development, neglecting workers' welfare and even mistreating workers also hinders industrial development and must be corrected. - Editor)

　　After discovering these deviations, the Municipal Party Committee is working with the trade union and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to study corrections. The issue of Tongchunhao beating workers is being discussed and deliberated in the industry, and preparations are being made to re-handle it. The Municipal Party Committee also instructed the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the trade union to maintain close contact in the future and to assign fixed cadres to lead key industries. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce will assign fixed cadres to lead industrial and commercial administration in the industry, and the trade union is also preparing cadres to lead the labor movement. The two departments will hold a joint meeting (with the participation of the Municipal Party Committee) every half month to exchange information and study work.

### 辛集端正政策解决实际困难　工厂商店都有增加

　　辛集端正政策解决实际困难
  　工厂商店都有增加
    【冀中电】自今年三月间冀中工商会议后，辛集市委和各工商部门均检讨出过去对发展工业的领导思想不明确，以及工运中的各种偏向。各部门都明确了重点：市委应注意加强工运领导，银行发放贷款有重点的扶助工业，裕华公司帮助工业产品和原料的供销。各部门分工后，便深入各行业进行具体帮助与领导。在具体帮助领导中，发现了不少问题，如各厂内工人工资按实物计算，资方资本按货币计算，物价波动资方即保不住实物；有的工人分红太多，影响了投资；皮革原料不许入口，影响了皮革业；以前大商带汇票来不能买货走，到银行办汇须半年时间，私商也不敢要。发现这些问题后，先经各行业小组讨论，又经各工商部门研究，后由市委提出解决办法，今后工厂可以主要原料作资本，商店以主要商品作资本，使资方保住原料和商品，不致因物价波动而受影响。各厂可规定劳动纪律。公营工厂由厂长、监委、职工会、工人讨论规定，私营工厂、作坊，由厂方会同工人共同规定。以后客商买货，可使用汇票，由银行办理，时间减到一个月。并规定允许专门制革原料入口。解决了这些实际问题后，打消了工商业户对工会和工运的怀疑顾虑，使工商业和工运有了新的发展。毯业主任张敬贤，白皮业经理崔可贵等，都要求职工会到他厂去组织工会。在六、七两月中，全市新增工业五十四户、商业二十户、添工人三百五十三人。铁工业往年一到七月就停工了，今年也没停。纺织业组织了土线整庄合作社，解决了原料困难，使了好线，又带动了妇女纺织。
    各厂工人已开始树立了新的劳动态度，使产量一般提高五分之二。聚隆铁工厂，以前每人一天作水车斗子十五个，现在作二十个到三十个。在劳资、师徒关系上也有改进。如华皮厂、元兴毛巾厂，工人对厂方的一切原料、工具、成品，都很耐心收拾。厂方也注意工人生活，工人病了经理亲身督促请医生，元兴经理任福顺利用休息时间，还教徒弟学织布。在技术发明方面，亦有很大成绩。牙刷工人赵情忠，创造了擦亮机和磨光机后，牙刷产量每天增加九倍。民生铁厂范文良创造了制造洋钉的工具，出的钉和外来货一样，数量已增多。万聚制皮厂技术工人王品一，用土产的惹黄代替了外来的＠子等熟皮子，每张皮即节洋五万四千元，全市一个月按熟皮七百八十八张计，即节省四千余万元。裕丰纸厂工人程国栋自制牙膏也已成功。此外并加强了公私团结，带动了私营工业。如私营大兴工厂有一阵没有做活，公营聚隆铁厂就建议他作水车料子，并不取代价的替他代卖。在纺织业的背月季节，市推进社收买了二十五户的成品，帮助他们渡过背月，并使已停业的五五织袜工厂复了业。
    市职工会掌握不紧　少数经理虐待工人
    市委发觉已注意纠正
    但由于该市职工会掌握政策不稳，市委检查不及时，少数厂长和经理片面接受或故意歪曲工业会议精神，而忽视工人福利，甚至虐待工人。如同春号鞭铺经理王丙春，因为一个工人在饭前喝了豌米汤，就怪工人不守铺规，连着两顿不叫工人吃饭，工人与他说理，他说工人破坏工商业，还要到市府去告工人，并拿棍子把工人赶出厂。工人要算工资他不给，还要打工人。职工会解决这个问题时，只动员工人“保护工商业”，少要工资，结果欠工资十万元，只给了一万五千元，对无理打骂工人的经理，却没受任何处分。有的经理单纯压低工资，降低工人生活。如兴元毛巾厂，工人已自动减资四分之一，厂方还要减，并由十天一顿面，减到一个月也没吃。同丰毛巾厂，光减工人工资，不减职员的。大丰风弓工厂，为了压低工资，作一张风弓由一百斤米减为七十斤，有活也不拦，也不向工人解释。结果工人散了，现在有活抓不到工人，影响了营业。（高工资政策固然妨碍工业发展，忽视工人福利甚至虐待工人，同样也妨碍工业发展，必须注意纠正。——编者）
    市委发觉这些偏向后，正和职工会、工商局研究纠正。对同春号打工人的问题，正在行业里讨论酝酿，准备重新处理。市委并指示工商局、职工会，今后要密切联系，固定干部领导重点行业。工商局固定干部到行业领导工商行政，职工会也准备干部领导工运。每半月两部门举行一次联席会议（市委参加），交换情况研究工作。
