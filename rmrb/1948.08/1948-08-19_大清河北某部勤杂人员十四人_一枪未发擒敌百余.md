Jizhong Telegram: On July 15th, fourteen support personnel of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army cleverly captured over a hundred enemies in a village north of the Daqing River without firing a single shot. On that morning, over a hundred defeated bandits suddenly advanced towards the village. The fourteen support personnel of the unit immediately took up their guns and charged towards the enemy. The quartermaster and two others were the first to rush to the top of the kiln occupied by the enemy and unexpectedly snatched the gun and command flag from the enemy's deputy company commander. The enemies below the kiln were still loudly asking, "Deputy Company Commander! What's happening? Are we advancing or not?" They also asked, "Which unit are you (referring to the fourteen support personnel of the PLA unit) from?" The fourteen support personnel cleverly replied, "The Gu'an Self-Defense Force," and "The Xiongxian Self-Defense Force, driven out by the Eighth Route Army." As the enemies were still half-believing and half-doubting, our support personnel rushed over to seize their guns, shouting, "Those who surrender will not be killed; lenient treatment will be given to prisoners!" The enemies immediately obediently surrendered their guns. The fourteen support personnel captured more than a hundred enemies without firing a single shot, seizing two machine guns, one submachine gun, fifty long and short guns, and over five thousand rounds of ammunition.

　　大清河北某部勤杂人员十四人
  　一枪未发擒敌百余
    【冀中电】七月十五日解放军某部勤杂人员十四人，于大清河北某村机智俘敌百余人。是日晨突有溃匪百余人向该村前进，该部勤杂人员十四人立时提枪向敌人冲去，司务长等三人首先冲上敌占据的窑顶，冷不防把敌人副中队长的枪和指挥旗夺过来。窑下的敌人还大声的问：“副中队长！怎么着？前进不？”又问：“你们（指解放军某部十四位勤杂人员）是哪部分？”十四名勤杂人员机警的回答说：“固安自卫队”，“雄县自卫队，叫八路军赶出来的。”敌人正半信半疑，我勤杂人员即跑过去夺枪，一面喊：“缴枪不杀；优待俘虏！”敌人立刻驯服的缴了枪。十四个勤杂人员一枪未发，活捉了一百多个敌人，缴机枪两挺，冲锋枪一支，长短枪五十支，子弹五千余发。　　　　　　　　（菊鲜）
