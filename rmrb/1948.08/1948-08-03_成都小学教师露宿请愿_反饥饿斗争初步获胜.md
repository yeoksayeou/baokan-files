Xinhua News Agency, North China, 25th -- According to reports in the Chiang-controlled area press, the Chengdu municipal elementary school teachers' anti-hunger struggle, after persisting for half a month, achieved an initial victory by mid-June. According to the Shanghai Observer Weekly published on June 26th and the Tianjin New Star newspaper of June 20th, the struggle unfolded as follows: Since the beginning of the school term this spring, Chengdu's municipal elementary school teachers had been receiving a monthly salary of only 900,000 yuan (Chiang currency) and a ration of four *shi* (peck) of rice. In May, the rice ration was reduced to one *shi*. From June 2nd to 6th, the elementary school teachers sent representatives to petition nine times, but their reasonable demands for a doubling of salaries and rice rations from April onwards, as well as monthly payments, were ignored by the Chiang government. From June 7th, hundreds of elementary school teachers (the Tianjin New Star newspaper reported over 700, the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao over 400), compelled by the unbearable reality of their living conditions, collectively went to the municipal government to petition. The municipal government still ignored them. The teachers, regardless of wind and rain, persisted in their petitioning struggle, camping out for several consecutive days. Under the pressure of the elementary school teachers' persistence and the sympathy of the general public, the Chiang government was forced in mid-June to agree to restore the monthly rice ration to four *shi* and to change the moldy rice to cash for self-purchase of "poverty-relief priced rice." The demand for a salary increase is still being dealt with evasively by the Chiang government.

The elementary school teachers' anti-hunger struggle received widespread sympathy and support. Over a thousand students from the Chengdu Provincial Normal School, Girls' Normal School, and Kindergarten Normal School held a sympathy demonstration and strike on June 8th to support their anti-hunger demands. During their outdoor petition, elementary school students frequently came in groups to bring meals, *guo kui* (flatbread), etc., to comfort their teachers. Students from universities, middle schools, and elementary schools launched fundraising campaigns for them, raising over ten billion yuan by mid-June (according to figures from the Shanghai Observer Weekly of June 26th), as well as a considerable amount of food.

    成都小学教师露宿请愿
    反饥饿斗争初步获胜
    【新华社华北二十五日电】据蒋区报刊披露：成都市立小学教师反饥饿斗争坚持半月后，至六月中旬已获得初步胜利。据六月二十六日出版的上海观察周刊及同月二十日天津新星报等报导此次斗争经过称：蓉市市立小学教师，自本年春季始业以来，月薪仅九十万元（蒋币，下同），及配给大米四市斗。至五月间配米被削减为一市斗，从六月二日起至六日五天内小学教师们派出代表请愿九次，但所提出从四月份起薪水、配米各增加一倍及按月发给的合理要求，均为蒋记市府所不理。自六月七日起，数百小学教师（津新星报载为七百余，沪大公报为四百余人）迫于生活之实在无法维持，乃集体前往市府请愿，市府仍置之不理。教师们不顾风雨，坚持请愿斗争，一连露宿数个，在小学教师的坚持与广大社会人士同情的压力下，蒋记市府于六月中旬被迫答应恢复每月配米四斗，并将霉米改为发款自购“赤贫平价米”，至加薪一项要求，蒋记市府尚在敷衍中。
    小学教师们的反饥饿斗争，获得广泛的同情与支持。成都省立师范、女师及幼稚师范千余学生为支持他们的反饥饿要求而于六月八日举行同情示威游行及罢课。在他们露宿请愿期间把小学生们经常成群结队的携带饭菜、锅魁（大饼）等来慰问他们的老师。各大、中、小学学生为他们展开募捐，至六月中旬已募得十多亿元（据六月二十六日上海观察周刊数字）及不少食物。
