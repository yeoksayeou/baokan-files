    [Jizhong Telegram] The Wuji Production Promotion Cooperative transported cloth to other areas to exchange for livestock, partially solving the problem of livestock shortage for local people. The first trip to Jin-Sui area brought back eight head of livestock, which were sold to the masses at the original price. The masses wanted the Promotion Cooperative to purchase more. The second trip to the North Yue area brought back twenty-one head, most of which were sold or loaned to the masses at a low price. The masses rushed to borrow and buy. There were some biases in this loan and sale of livestock. It was not combined with the production cadres of the residential area, and no detailed examination was made of the borrowers and buyers. Some speculators took the opportunity to engage in reselling for profit. A household in Xinzhuang Village borrowed a mule worth 170,000 yuan (Jizhong currency), but they sold it for 210,000 yuan. After a review, improvement measures were determined, and another twenty-six head were transported. This time, in order to truly lend or sell to households lacking livestock, the district production cadres were responsible for introducing the masses who lacked livestock to the cooperative for borrowing and buying in a planned way, and they were quickly distributed again. In these few times, a total of 2,400 bolts of homespun cloth were sold for the masses, exchanging for fifty-five head of livestock. Eighteen head were sold and thirty-seven head were loaned, solving the problem of livestock shortage for more than eighty households in thirteen villages. The county's Promotion Cooperative has now transported another 1,500 bolts of homespun cloth to Jin-Sui to exchange for livestock.

    无极生产推进社
    输出土布换回牲口
    【冀中电】无极生产推进社运布到外区换牲口，部分解决了当地群众缺牲口的困难。第一次到晋绥换回牲口八头，按原价卖给群众。群众都要推进社再去购买。第二次到北岳区换回二十一头，也大部低价卖给和贷给了群众。群众争先贷买。这次贷卖牲口发生了一些偏向，没有和住区的生产干部结合，对贷买户也没作详细审查，有些投机商乘机贩卖渔利。辛庄村一户贷了一个骡子，价值十七万元（冀钞），他却卖了二十一万元。经过检讨确定了改进办法，又运来二十六头。这次为了真正贷给或卖给缺牲口户，就有计划的让区生产干部负责介绍缺牲口的群众来社贷买，很快又发完了。这几次共替群众推销土布二千四百匹，换回牲口五十五头。卖出十八头，贷出三十七头，解决了十三个村、八十多户缺牲口的困难。该县推进社现又运出土布一千五百匹。到晋绥去换牲口。
