(Pingbao Frontline Communication) In the battle where a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army broke through the southern city of Xushui, it correctly combined the development of military democracy with dedicated planning, climbed the city in eight minutes, and successfully completed the combat mission. On the evening of the 18th, the unit occupied the southern gate and besieged Xushui city. From the time of the siege until the attack on the city at 7:00 AM on the 20th, for more than 30 hours, all commanders and fighters launched a mass-based, democratic, and dedicated planning movement on the battlefield. State-owned cadres crawled and climbed to places sixty to seventy meters away from the city, repeatedly inspected the city walls, the city's bunkers, and the gun emplacements. They measured the distance of the five lines of obstacles outside the fortifications, and then returned to the regiment to give the regimental and battalion cadres specific details for study. After the study, they inspected and rechecked repeatedly, several times, before finally drawing up a specific combat plan and handing it over to the assault team. The assault team and each combat group, in the same spirit, repeatedly reconnoitered, studied, practiced, and corrected the plan. Every soldier in the demolition group and the ladder-building group took turns to look at the terrain and the enemy's fortifications. They looked once, discussed once, discussed again after looking, and looked again after discussing, until everyone clearly understood their tasks and had the confidence to win. In the discussion, all commanders and fighters could fully discuss specific issues such as the methods for completing their own tasks, the organization of the troops, the command at all levels, and mutual cooperation. Guo Baotai, a soldier from the tenth squad of a certain company in the ladder-building and city-climbing group, had an opinion about being assigned as the sixth climber. He argued that regardless of the organization, whoever climbed the city first would be the most meritorious. The squads and groups then began a discussion. Everyone believed that climbing the city first, regardless of the number, was not as good as climbing the city with an organized number. Guo Baotai agreed with this opinion, but was still dissatisfied with being assigned as number six. Everyone agreed to promote him to third place. After repeatedly looking at the terrain, the demolition team members proposed to the superiors that there were eight gun emplacements that greatly hindered them from completing their mission, and requested a solution. The regimental headquarters, in coordination with the fire support team, studied specific ways to destroy and block these eight gun emplacements and made a guarantee to the demolition team. During the discussion and study, the combat organizations mutually proposed requests and opinions on coordinated actions. After discussing the solutions, they mutually guaranteed that all difficult problems would be resolved. In order to prevent a few soldiers from falling behind, the majority of active soldiers proposed discipline to ensure the consistency of all actions. At this time, the leadership issued an order requiring the entire army to overcome difficulties and resolutely complete the mission. At 7:00 AM on the 20th, the general attack began. All the commanders and fighters of the unit were filled with courage, had excellent organization, and successfully climbed the city in eight minutes, successfully completing the assault combat mission.

    某部徐水战斗中发扬军事民主
    开展群众性计划运动
    全体指战员反复侦察研究保证胜利
    【平保前线通讯】解放军某部突破徐水南城战斗中，正确开展军事民主与专心计划密切结合，八分钟登城，胜利完成战斗任务。十八日晚，该部占领南关，包围徐水城，至二十日上午七时攻城，三十多小时内，全体指战员，在战地展开一个群众性的民主的专心计划运动。国营干部，滚滚爬爬，到距城六七十米的地方，反复视察数次，查明城上城下的城碉堡枪眼，测量据外五道障碍的距离，然后回团，给予团营干部具体研究，研究后，再视察、复查，反复数次，最后才具体拟出作战方案，交给突击队。突击队及各战斗小组，又以同样精神，反复侦察、研究、演习、补正。爆炸组、架梯组的每个战士，都轮流着去看了地形和敌人工事，看一次，讨论一次，讨论后再看，看后再讨论，直到每个人都明确了任务，具备了胜利信心。讨论中，全体指战员，都可对完成自己任务的方法及部队组织、各级指挥、互相配合等具体问题，提出充分讨论。架梯登城组，某连十班战士郭保泰，对于把他编成登城第六号有意见，他主张不管组织，谁抢先登城，谁最有功。各班、组就展开讨论。大家认为：不管号数，抢先登城，不如以号数有组织登城好。郭保泰同意了这意见；但对编为六号还不满。大家同意提他为第三名。爆破组员反复看地形后，向上级提出有八个枪眼，对他们完成任务阻力很大，要求解决，团部协同火力队，研究摧毁和封锁这八个枪眼的具体办法，并向爆破队作了保证。讨论研究中，各战斗组织互相提出协同动作的要求意见。讨论出办法后，就互相保证困难问题全部解决。多数积极战士，为防止少数战士落后，提出纪律，保证全体动作的一致。领导上这时下了命令，要求全军克服困难，坚决完成任务。二十日七时，总攻开始，该部全体指战员，勇气倍增，组织极佳，八分钟即顺利登城，胜利完成了突击战斗任务。
