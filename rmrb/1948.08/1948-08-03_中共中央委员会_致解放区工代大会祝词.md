Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: The full text of the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Workers' Congress of the Liberated Areas is as follows:

To the Presidium of the Workers' Congress of the Liberated Areas and to the worker representatives from various liberated areas and from major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who have traveled from afar:

Dear Comrades: We are greatly excited to learn that your congress will open in Harbin on August 1st. Since the Fifth National Labor Congress held in Shanghai in secrecy in 1929, the congress you are holding now is the first in nineteen years. The holding of this congress indicates that our country's people's liberation war under the leadership of the proletariat is approaching its final victory, that a new era of great revolution on a national scale has arrived again, and that the Kuomintang reactionary clique's policy of splitting the working class nationwide has been finally declared bankrupt, and the national workers' movement has been reunited under the banner of revolution. Therefore, the representatives of workers and staff from all over the country can reunite in their own liberated cities to discuss the major issues concerning the fate of the working class.

Comrades! At a time when the People's Liberation Army is winning victories in its offensive, a new high tide of great revolution is developing throughout the country, and the rule of the American imperialist lackey Kuomintang reactionary clique is approaching its final collapse, the greatest task of the working class nationwide is to first unite itself, and with its own heroic struggle and self-sacrificing spirit, to unite the peasants, independent laborers, self-employed professionals, intellectuals, the free bourgeoisie, and all patriotic elements, to assist the People's Liberation Army, to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the Kuomintang's reactionary troops, to overthrow the evil rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary clique, and to establish an independent, free, strong, and unified Chinese People's Democratic Republic. For this common goal, the task of workers and staff in the liberated areas is to revitalize industry, consolidate the liberated areas, and support the front lines under Comrade Mao Zedong's famous economic policy, namely "Develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." The task of workers and staff in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is to unite all workers and staff and all the people, to fight against American imperialism and bureaucratic capital, to provide necessary and possible support for the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army, and to help the democratic government take over the cities in an orderly manner after the cities are liberated. In order to accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to rapidly strengthen the work of the trade unions, unite and educate the masses of workers and staff, and make them a leading force in the people's democratic republic. We believe that the Chinese working class, which has a glorious tradition of the "February 7th" strike, the "May 30th" strike, provincial and municipal strikes, the three uprisings in Shanghai, and the nationwide strike struggle during the First Great Revolution, and which has produced heroic figures such as Lin Xiangqian [林祥谦], Shi Yang [施洋], Liu Hua [刘华], Zhao Shiyan [赵世炎], Wang Shouhua [汪寿华], Su Zhaozheng [苏兆征], Wang Hebo [王荷波], Guo Liang [郭亮], Deng Zhongxia [邓中夏], Xiang Ying [项英], Xu Baihao [许白昊], Zhang Tailei [张太雷], Luo Dengxian [罗登贤], Yang Yin [杨殷], Lin Yuying [林育英], and Deng Fa [邓发], will surely victoriously accomplish these glorious tasks at today's congress. We wish the congress success.

    致解放区工代大会祝词
    【新华社陕北一日电】中国共产党中央委员会致解放区工人代表大会的祝词全文如下：
    中国解放区工人代表大会主席团转各解放区工人代表及由国民党统治区各大城市远道前来的工人代表们：
    亲爱的同志们：我们以最大的兴奋闻悉你们的大会将于八月一日在哈尔滨开幕的消息。自从一九二九年在上海秘密环境下举行的第五次全国劳动大会以来，你们现在所举行的大会是十九年来的第一次。此次大会的举行，表示在无产阶级领导下的我国的人民解放战争已经接近最后胜利，表示全国性的新的大革命时期，又已到来，表示国民党反动集团在全国工人中的分裂政策已经最后宣告破产，全国工人运动重新在革命的旗帜下统一起来。因此，全国的工人和职员代表，乃得重新团聚一堂，在业已解放了的自己的城市中，讨论工人阶级命运所系的重大问题。
    同志们！当此人民解放军在进攻中节节胜利，新的大革命高潮正在向全国范围内发展，美国帝国主义走狗国民党反动集团的统治业已接近最后崩溃的时候，全国工人阶级的最大任务，就是首先团结自己，并以自己的英勇奋斗与自我牺牲精神去团结农民，独立劳动者，自由职业者，知识分子，自由资产阶级与一切爱国分子，帮助人民解放军，坚决彻底干净全部地歼灭国民党的反动军队，推翻美国帝国主义与国民党反动集团的万恶统治，建立独立自由强健和统一的中华人民民主共和国。为了这个共同的目的，解放区工人和职员的任务，是在毛泽东同志著名的经济方针，即“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的方针之下，振兴工业，巩固解放区，支援前线。国民党统治区工人和职员的任务，是团结全体职工和全体人民，对美国帝国主义与官僚资本作斗争，对人民解放军的胜利进攻作必要的和可能的配合，并在城市被解放以后帮助民主政府有秩序地接管城市。为了完成这些任务，必须迅速加强工会的工作，团结和教育工人职员群众，使他们成为人民民主共和国的领导力量。我们相信，在历史上有“二七”罢工、“五卅”罢工、省市罢工、上海三次起义和第一次大革命时期普遍全国的罢工斗争和广州起义等光荣传统的、曾经产生过象林祥谦、施洋、刘华、赵世炎、汪寿华、苏兆征、王荷波、郭亮、邓中夏、项英、许白昊、张太雷、罗登贤、杨殷、林育英、邓发等英雄人物的中国工人阶级的今天的代表大会，必能胜利地完成这些光荣的任务。敬祝大会的成功。
            中国共产党中央委员会
              一九四八年七月二十九日
