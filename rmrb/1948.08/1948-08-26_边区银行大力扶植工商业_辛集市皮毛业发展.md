　　Bianqu Bank Vigorously Supports Industry and Commerce
  　Xinji City's Leather Industry Develops
    [Our News] The Xinji branch of the Bianqu Bank has actively handled deposit and loan business in the past six months, effectively supporting the development of industry and commerce, especially with great achievements in supporting the leather industry. This spring, prices plummeted, and all red leather factories generally lost money. The bank established overdraft relationships with twenty-eight red leather factories, overdrafting more than 100 million yuan successively to help them overcome difficulties and continue operating as usual. The Xizhang Leather Factory, facing the danger of closing down due to insufficient turnover, repaid most of its debts in less than two months with the support of the bank. Since entering the off-season for leather factories in the summer, the bank has loaned out another 20 million yuan to enable the leather factories to go to Xingtai and Linqing to buy tanning materials and cowhide in a planned way, thus getting through the off-season. The number of white leather and felt businesses in the city has increased from 33 before the new year to 53. Most of them have established relationships with the bank, and the overdraft amount has increased from no more than 300,000 yuan per household to 600,000 to 1 million yuan. The masses in Dongshizhuang outside the city raised 500,000 yuan and borrowed another 3.7 million yuan from the bank to organize a white leather and felt shoe factory. The quality of the finished products is very good, and they are planning to expand the scale. Recently, felt businesses generally felt that the amount exceeding the overdraft was too large. After joint consultation, they are willing to sell the finished products to the bank at an appropriate price and withdraw capital to continue their activities. In order to handle warehousing and support the development of industry and commerce with physical objects, the bank immediately agreed, and 12,000 pairs of felt shoes have now been written up. By July, the number of leather businesses in the city had increased from 120 to 160, and 98 percent had established relationships with the bank, with a total overdraft of 140 million yuan.

　　边区银行大力扶植工商业
  　辛集市皮毛业发展
    【本报讯】边区银行辛集支行半年来积极办理存放款业务，有力的扶植了工商业的发展，尤以扶植皮毛业的成绩为大。今春物价暴跌，各红皮厂普遍赔钱。银行与二十八家红皮厂建立透支关系，先后透支一亿多，帮助他们渡过困难，得以照常经营。因周转不动，面临倒闭危险的锡章皮厂，在银行扶植下，经营不到两个月，补还了大部亏欠。入夏以来为皮厂淡月，银行又贷出两千万元，使皮厂能有计划的去邢台、临清一带，买回制革料子和牛皮，渡过淡月。该市白皮和毡行，已由年前的三十三户增至五十三户。他们多与银行建立了来往，透支数由每户不超过三十万，增至六十万到一百万。市外东石庄群众集股五十万，又到银行贷款三百七十万，组织了白皮、毡鞋工厂，成品质量很好，正计划扩大规模。近来毡行普遍感到超过透支数太大，经共同商讨，愿以适当价格，将成品卖给银行，抽出资本继续活动。银行为办理仓库，以实物支持工商业发展，当即同意，现已写起毡鞋一万二千双。至七月份全市皮毛业已由一百二十户增到一百六十户，百分之九十八与银行建立了来往，总透支额达一亿四千万元。
