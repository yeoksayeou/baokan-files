Fragments of Guerrilla Warfare South of the Yellow River
	Ji Lu Yu Correspondence
	(I) Deputy Squad Leader Su Cleverly Seizes a Cart
		On July 22nd, Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division, 81st Brigade, 143rd Regiment, moved south along the Dongkao Highway. Su Xiuxian, the deputy squad leader of the 5th District team of Dongming, along with a communicator and Deputy Squad Leader Zhang, went to scout on both sides of the highway. When the enemy's main force passed, they hid in the sorghum fields. When scattered enemies passed by, they would come out and ask: "Are there any more large units behind?" "Yes! What are you doing!" "Scouting platoon." The three of them were in plain clothes, and the enemy couldn't recognize them. Finally, they heard the enemy say: "There's only one cart behind." At this time, Deputy Squad Leader Su and the other two hid in the sorghum fields again. After a while, four enemies escorted a cart. Deputy Squad Leader Su took a quick step, extended his pistol in one hand, and grabbed the gun strap of an enemy with the other. The enemy, seeing the situation was not good, surrendered his gun. The other three enemies ran away, but two were killed on the spot and one was captured alive, seizing a total of four guns, one new cart, two mules, over a thousand rounds of various bullets, seventy-five 60mm mortar shells, sixteen hand grenades, and military clothing, foreign blankets, and other items.
	(II) Armed Work Team Members Cleverly Capture Chiang's Soldiers
		A platoon of the Special Service Company of the 600th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Division, 200th Brigade, passed through Qianhou Li Lou in Dingtao County with only one horse and more than twenty men. Eight members of our Dingtao Armed Work Team ran behind the enemy, planning to wipe out all of these enemies. So we detoured and ran ahead of the enemy. "Bang, bang," we started shooting from both sides. As soon as the enemy heard the gunshots, they panicked and turned around to run back. The six members of our Armed Work Team rushed towards them like tigers pouncing on sheep, shooting while shouting: "Hand over your guns and we won't kill you, we are the People's Liberation Army." At this time, the enemy platoon leader was so frightened that he raised his Thompson submachine gun and knelt down. The other twenty-plus Chiang's soldiers obediently handed over their guns.

　　黄河南游击战片断
  　冀鲁豫通讯
    （一）苏队副巧夺马车
    七月二十二日，蒋匪整六十八师八十一旅一四三团，顺着东考公路向南去，我东明五区队苏修线队副，带着一个通讯员和张副班长，到公路两侧侦察，当敌大队经过时，他们就藏在高粱地内，零星敌人经过时，就出来问：“后边还有大队吗？”“有！你是干啥的！”“搜索排。”他三人穿着便衣，敌人也认不出来。最后听到敌人说：“后边只一辆马车了。”这时苏队副等三人，就又藏在高粱地内，不一会，四个敌人押着一辆马车过来了，苏队副紧走一步，一手伸出短枪，一手抓住一个敌人的背枪带，敌人看势不对，就缴了枪，其余三个敌人，拿腿便跑，但当场被打死二名，活捉一名，共缴获枪四支，新马车一辆，骡子两匹，各种子弹千余发，六零炮弹七十五发，手榴弹十六个，及军衣洋毯等物。
    （二）武工队员机警擒蒋军
    蒋匪整五师二百旅六百团特务连的一个排，只带着一匹马，二十多个人，从定陶县前后李楼经过，我定陶八个武工队员，跑在敌人的后面，计划要将这伙敌人全部歼灭，于是我们人绕道跑到敌人头里，“叭叭”从两边打起枪来，敌人一听枪响，慌张的扭头便往后跑，后边我六个武工队员，如猛虎扑羊似的，向他们冲上去，一面打枪，一面高喊：“交枪不杀，我们是解放军。”这时，敌人的排长吓得把汤姆式枪一举跪下了，其余二十多个蒋军，都很顺从的交了枪。
