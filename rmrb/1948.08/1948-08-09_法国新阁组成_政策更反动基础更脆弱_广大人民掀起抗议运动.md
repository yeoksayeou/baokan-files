    Comprehensive reports: The French Marie cabinet was declared formed on July 27th. The United Press on the 27th described the Marie cabinet as a "hodgepodge government," including six different parties, from the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement, to the disguised de Gaulle faction (Liberal Republican Party and Independent Republican Party). Its cabinet members include Blum (Deputy Prime Minister), Schuman (Foreign Minister), Moch (Interior Minister, denounced by French workers as a "murderer"), Mayer (Defense Minister), and Renault (Finance Minister, a traitor who handed over power to Pétain during the war) and other reactionary elements of all stripes. Marie himself belongs to the Radical Party, the party of Daladier, one of the architects of the Munich policy. In his platform announced on the 24th, Marie openly stated that he would "restrict" "wage increases" and would "undertake radical reforms in the management of nationalized industries" which are greatly criticized by American and French monopoly capital - that is, to undermine the nationalization of industry; and said that he would adhere to "the foreign policy based on the London West German issue agreement and the Marshall Plan." Renault even threatened to "abolish the forty-eight-hour work week." Therefore, judging from its composition and platform, the Marie cabinet is more inclined to reaction than the Schuman cabinet.
    Such a cabinet that is more "right-leaning" had already stirred up a wave of protests among the French working people even before it took office. TASS reported on the 26th: "A powerful protest movement is forming in the country against the appointment of 'gravediggers of the Republic' to key government positions." L'Humanité published resolutions of protest from various factories and groups, and the workers' protest letter from the Ministry of Veterans Affairs even called for "the early formation of a democratic government." Participating in this protest movement are not only workers from the General Confederation of Labor led by the Communist Party, but also workers from "Workers' Force" (which the Socialist Party uses to split French workers' unity), as well as workers from the Christian Labor Confederation, reflecting that the Marie cabinet is even more unpopular among the broad masses of the French people. Therefore, the United Press reported on the 27th that "political commentators" in Paris are "not very enthusiastic about this hodgepodge government and are not very optimistic about its long-term existence." The reactionary Marie cabinet has a more unstable and fragile foundation than the Schuman cabinet.

    法国新阁组成
    政策更反动基础更脆弱
    广大人民掀起抗议运动
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合报导：法国马利内阁已于七月二十七日宣告组成。这个马利内阁，合众社二十七日电讯称之为“七拼八凑的政府”，它包括了六个不同的党派，从急进社会党、社会党、人民共和党起，直到伪装下的戴高乐派（自由共和党和独立共和党），它的阁员则包括了勃鲁姆（副总理），舒曼（外长），摩许（内长，法国工人斥之为“杀人犯”），迈耶（国防部长），直到雷诺（财长，战时将政权交给贝当的卖国贼）等各式各样的反动分子。马利自己属急进党，该党是战斗慕尼黑政策制订人之一达拉第的党。马利二十四日宣布的政纲中，公然说他要“限制”“工资的上涨”，要在美法垄断资本大加非难的“国有化工业的管理中，从事激烈的改革”——这就是要破坏工业国有化；并说他要坚守“根据伦敦西德问题协定和马歇尔计划的外交政策”。雷诺更扬言要“废除四十八小时工作制”。因此，从它的成份和政纲来看，马利内阁较舒曼内阁更加趋向反动。
    这样一个更“向右转”的内阁，当它尚未登场的时候，法国劳动人民中间就掀起了一片抗议声。塔斯社二十六日电称：“强大的抗议运动正在国内形成，反对政府主要职位由‘共和国的掘墓人’充任”。人道报刊载了来自各个工厂各个团体的抗议决议，退伍军人事务部的工人抗议书上，更提出要求“及早组成民主政府”。参加这一抗议运动的，不仅有共产党领导的总工会的工人，而且有“工人力量”（它是社会党用来分裂法国工人团结的工具）的工人，以及基督教劳工联盟的工人，这反映了马利新阁，更为法国广大人民所不满。因此，合众社二十七日电称：巴黎的“政治评论家，对这种七拼八凑的政府，很少热心，并对其长期存在不甚乐观”。反动的马利内阁，其基础较之舒曼内阁更加不稳定和更加脆弱。
