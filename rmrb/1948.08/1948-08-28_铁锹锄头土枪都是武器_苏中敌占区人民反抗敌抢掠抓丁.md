　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, August 25th: In the enemy-occupied areas of Yang (zhou) and Yi (zheng) in central Jiangsu, mass struggles against conscription and looting have continuously erupted: (1) On July 1st, more than ten members of the Baoding (local security) team of the enemy's eighth district of Jiangdu (Yangzhou) went to Yangjia Temple to conscript soldiers. The people shouted and attacked, and more than two hundred people swarmed up with rice seedling planters (agricultural tools for transplanting rice seedlings). Under the attack of sticks and rakes, the Baoding team fled in a panic. (2) During the "encampment and suppression" of the Jiangdu Security Regiment in Jiuli Settlement, the people's melons, vegetables, chickens, ducks, bedding, etc. were all looted, and dozens of women were raped. On the evening of July 10th, a squad of the regiment broke into a civilian's home near Jiuzhong Settlement, stabbed resident Shi Wenyu to death with a bayonet, and then raped his sister. The next day, after the news spread, the local people were extremely悲愤 (filled with grief and indignation). Forty to fifty people immediately carried Shi Wenyu's body to the Yi Zheng puppet county government to demonstrate. Under the power of the masses, the puppet county government had no choice but to execute a deserter to muddle through. (3) On July 12th, a squad of the regiment went to the Huayuan Village and Cao Village areas, three miles northwest of Jiuli Settlement, to loot. The masses beat gongs and gathered fifty to sixty people, carrying shovels, hoes, homemade guns, and pitchforks, and rushed up shouting. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Security Regiment fled in a hurry. Afterwards, the enemy regiment headquarters in Jiuzhong Settlement sent people to arrest nine civilians. So the people from several villages all crowded to the enemy regiment headquarters. The enemy regiment headquarters asked: "Why are you attacking the National Army?" The people firmly replied: "We are attacking bandits." The person questioning turned red in the face and had no choice but to release the arrested civilians.

  　苏中敌占区人民反抗敌抢掠抓丁
    【新华社华东二十五日电】苏中扬（州）仪（征）一带敌占区，连续爆发群众性的反抓丁、反抢掠斗争：（一）七月一日，敌江都（扬州）八区保警队员十余人至杨家庙抓丁，老百姓一声喊打，二百余人手持秧炮（锄秧农具）蜂拥而上，在棍钯交加下，保警抱头鼠窜。（二）敌江都保安团在九里集“驻剿”期中，将老百姓的瓜菜、鸡鸭、被服等抢掠一空，妇女被强奸者达数十人。七月十日晚，一团警闯入九中集附近一民家以刺刀刺毙居民石文玉后强奸其姐，第二天消息传出后，当地人民悲愤异常，四、五十人随即将石文玉尸体抬入仪征伪县府示威，在群众威力下，伪县府不得不枪毙一逃兵以蒙混搪塞。（三）七月十二日，该团一个班至九里集西北三里的花园庄、曹庄一带抢掠，群众乃鸣锣聚集五、六十人，扛着铁锹、锄、土枪及叉子等呐喊涌上，保安团见势不妙，慌忙逃去。事后九中集敌团部派人抓去九个老百姓，于是几个庄子的老百姓都拥去，敌团部问：“你们为什么打国军？”老百姓坚决回答：“我们打的是土匪”。询问的人面红耳赤只好将抓去的老百姓放回。
