    Organizing the Masses to Produce and Repay Debts
    The Datuo Village Cooperative in Pingshun Has a Good Method
    [Taihang News] Datuo Village, Pingshun, convened a mass meeting of the entire village to discuss the rectification of the cooperative. When the cooperative settled accounts in March of this year, it only earned 100,000 yuan in silver dollars. After deducting furniture and external debts (the external debts totaled 150,000 yuan, all borrowed from villagers), the cooperative had very little working capital, which greatly affected the development of its business. At the end of last year, the cooperative felt that the external debts were too large, affecting business, and had asked the masses to clear the accounts. At that time, it was simply a matter of demanding payment, and the masses could not afford to repay, some preparing to use their shares to offset the debt, and some resisting repayment. 社员Member Liu Huaide said: "Calculate my account for me and withdraw my shares to pay you back." Lu Cai said: "The cooperative is really anxious to collect debts and doesn't take care of the difficulties of the masses." Until now, the debts have not been cleared. This time, in discussing the rectification of the cooperative, it was decided to first clear the external debts and organize the masses to produce and earn money to repay the debts. After the meeting, everyone was organized to dig medicinal materials, and the cooperative was responsible for purchasing and selling them. Seventy full and semi-laborers were organized in the whole village. In two days, they dug 3,300 jin of white sesame seeds (45 yuan per jin) and 300 jin of high-quality herbs (150 yuan per jin), clearing the 150,000 yuan owed to the cooperative, with a surplus of 43,500 yuan. The masses were very happy. Li Zhen said: "I owed the cooperative 4,000 yuan, and it only took me a day to pay off the debt, with a surplus of 5,000 yuan." Yuan Shuan said: "My family has long had nothing to eat, how could I repay the debt? Digging medicinal materials, after repaying the debt, the remaining money is enough to buy half a month's worth of bran and vegetables." Liu Shuanshu did not participate in digging medicinal materials and said regretfully: "I didn't think this would work, who knew that everyone else had paid off their debts, I have to hurry up and do it."

    组织群众生产还帐
    平顺达驮村合作社办法好
    【太行讯】平顺达驮村召开全村群众大会，讨论整顿合作社的问题。该社今年三月结算帐目时，只赚洋十万元，除家具及外欠（外欠共十五万元，都是本村群众借的）占有外，合作社流动股金就很少了，大大的影响了营业的开展。去年年底合作社即感到外欠过多，影响营业，曾叫群众清理帐目。那时只是单纯的要帐，群众还不起，有的准备以股金顶帐，有的抵抗不还。社员刘怀德说：“你给我算算帐，抽出股来还你吧”。路才说：“合作社要帐真急，不照顾群众的困难”。直到现在欠帐还未要清。这次讨论整顿合作社，决定首先清理外欠，组织群众生产，赚钱还帐。会后即组织大家刨药材，合作社负责收买出售。全村组织了全半劳力七十人。两天即刨白芝三千三百斤（每斤四十五元），高本三百斤（每斤一百五十元），还清欠合作社的十五万元，还余四万三千五百元。群众十分高兴，李贞则说：“我欠合作社四千元，费了一天工夫就还了帐，还余下五千元”。原拴则说：“我家早就没有吃的了，怎能还帐呢？刨药材除还了帐，余下钱还够买半月的糠菜吃”。刘拴戍没参加刨药材，很后悔的说：“我就没认为这还顶事，谁知人家都还了帐啦，可得赶快干哩”。
