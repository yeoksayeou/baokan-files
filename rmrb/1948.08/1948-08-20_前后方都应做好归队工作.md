Asking and Answering

　　Both Front and Rear Should Do a Good Job of Returning to the Ranks
　　Comrade Editor:
　　Our department's cadres have encountered a problem in their studies that they cannot understand. Please provide an answer.
　　After the Border Government ordered the abolition of the pass system in the entire North China Liberated Area, some lower-level cadres and some soldiers in the troops, due to the absence of pass restrictions, deliberately ran around, and some soldiers even deserted and went home. The local authorities did not mobilize them to return to the ranks, and the troops did not deeply investigate. This is not right. The local government should have the responsibility to mobilize them to return to the ranks, because these people returning to the ranks is beneficial to the revolution.
　　Fourth Battalion, Supplementary Regiment, Dai Shaohuai
　　△Answer: In order to strive for greater victory in the war, consolidating the troops is indeed an important issue. Not only should the field army strengthen the ideological education of soldiers and improve their political awareness to reduce desertion, but local party and government workers should also earnestly do a good job in mobilizing deserters to return to the ranks. For example, conduct a detailed investigation of the number of people who should return to the ranks, analyze the reasons why they are overdue, study solutions, solve family difficulties, and patiently persuade and mobilize (all bad practices of forced orders, deception, and abuse should be prohibited). It is wrong to adopt an attitude of indifference or even shielding towards these soldiers and cadres who should return to the ranks. As for the abolition of passes, it is a need for the construction of the liberated areas today. If soldiers desert, we should examine why we didn't do our work well, which has nothing to do with the abolition of passes.

专栏：询问与答复

　　前后方都应做好归队工作
    编辑同志：
    敝部全体干部在学习中，发现个问题搞不通，请解答一下。
    边府命令全华北解放区内一律取消路条制后，部队里有个别下层干部及部分战士，因无路条的限制，故意东跑西串，甚至有些战士就开小差回了家。而地方上不动员其归队，部队也不深刻加以追究。这样是不对的，地方政府应有责任动员其归队，因为这些人归了队，对革命是有利的。
　　补团四营戴绍怀
    △答：为了争取战争的更大胜利，巩固部队确是一个重要问题，不但野战军应加强战士的思想教育，提高其政治觉悟，以减少逃亡，地方党政工作人员也应认真做好动员逃亡战士的归队工作。如详细调查应归队人数，分析他们逾期不归原因，研究出解决办法，解决家庭困难，耐心说服动员（应禁止一切强迫命令欺骗虐待的坏作风）。对于这些应该归队的战士干部采取放任不理甚至包庇的态度是错误的。至于取消路条是今天解放区建设上的需要，战士开小差应检讨我们工作没作好，与取消路条无关系。　　　　　　　　　　——编者
