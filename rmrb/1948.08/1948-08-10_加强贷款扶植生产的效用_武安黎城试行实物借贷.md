[Taihang Telegram] The Taihang District Branch of the Jinnan Bank of the Taihang District convened a meeting of cadres from the Wu'an and Licheng County Branches and the County Federation of Cooperatives on the 5th of this month to study and pilot the method of in-kind lending to replace monetary lending. At the meeting, Deputy Manager Zhao reviewed the production loans issued in previous years, saying: In the past, loans did solve the difficulties of some farmers, but due to the limited amount of funds, it was difficult to meet the needs of the masses. In addition, we had deviations in implementing the low-interest loan policy in the past, which actually formed subsidy for losses. Under the condition of rising prices, although the amount of loans has increased year by year, the actual strength of supporting the masses' production has been reduced year by year. Also, due to problems such as evenly distributing resources in our practices, the loans were dispersed, greatly reducing the role of loans in supporting production. Due to wartime price increases, farmers demand that their investment gains and losses be calculated in kind, and we must meet this demand of the masses. In the past, we had deviations in implementing credit policies, and farmers felt that there was no profit in saving money. At the same time, they were afraid of exposing their property and dared not deposit money, which prevented the development of rural credit activities and restricted the production of the masses. Deputy Manager Zhao then elaborated on the benefits of implementing in-kind lending, using state capital to take the lead in advocating in-kind lending, directly lending production capital and tools to the masses, not lending cash and means of subsistence, and the masses returning production materials equivalent to the loans. This can not only give full play to the role of loans in supporting the production of the masses, but also avoid the dispersion and waste of loans. The distribution should be closely combined with mobilizing and organizing the masses to produce, and should be lent according to the actual needs of the masses' production. In practice, it should be used in a relatively concentrated manner to solve a major production difficulty, such as livestock, fertilizers, farm tools, and raw materials for water conservancy. This method is suitable for the characteristics of rural areas during wartime, and will encourage social lending activities, so that a large amount of social idle funds can be invested in production. Bank capital should always maintain a certain strength to support the production of the masses. Everyone discussed his opinions and unanimously agreed to use Wu'an and Licheng as pilot areas to try out in-kind lending. It was also unanimously believed that in order to implement this method, it is first necessary to solve the cadres' erroneous relief views that hinder production and the idea of being afraid of the trouble of in-kind lending.

    加强贷款扶植生产的效用
    武安黎城试行实物借贷
    【太行电】冀南银行太行区行于本月五日召开武安、黎城两县支行及县联社干部会，研究试行以实物借贷代替货币借贷的办法。会上赵副经理对历年发放生产贷款作了检讨，他说：以往贷款确实是解决了部分农民的困难，但由于款额有限，很难满足群众要求，加上我们过去在执行低利贷款政策上有偏向，实际形成赔款津贴。在物价上涨的情况下，贷款额虽年有增加，但扶植群众生产的实际力量却是年年减少，又因在作法上有平均使用力量等毛病，使贷款分散，大大降低了贷款扶助生产的作用。由于战时物价上涨，农民要求以实物计算其投资损益，我们必须满足群众这个要求。过去我们执行信贷政策有偏差，农民觉得存款无利，同时更怕暴露财产而不敢存款，致使农村信用活动不能开展，群众生产受到限制。赵副经理继阐述实行实物借贷办法的好处，以国家资本带头来倡导实物借贷，直接将生产资本、工具贷给群众，不贷给现款和生活资料，群众以相当于贷款的生产物归还，既能充分发挥贷款扶持群众生产的作用，亦可避免贷款的分散和浪费。发放时要和发动与组织群众生产紧密结合，根据群众生产的实际需要贷给。作法上应比较集中的使用，以解决一个生产上的主要困难，如牲口、肥料、农具、水利原料等。此种方法适合战时农村特点，将鼓励社会借贷活动，使大量社会游资投入生产。银行资本应经常保持一定力量扶持群众生产。大家讨论了他的意见，一致同意以武安黎城作试验区，试行实物借贷。并一致认为实行此一方法，首先必须解决干部错误的妨害生产的救济观点及因怕实物借贷麻烦的思想。
