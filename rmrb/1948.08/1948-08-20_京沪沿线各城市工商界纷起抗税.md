Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: According to the "Shanghai Times" and "Wen" magazine, Volume 3, Issue 12, industry and commerce circles in cities along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line are rising up to resist the increasingly heavy exorbitant taxes imposed by the Kuomintang. For example, the rice and grain industry in Wuxi, to protest the Kuomintang's collection of the so-called "temporary income tax for merchants," which levies a high tax rate of 20% of the goods' value (i.e., two dou of rice are taxed for every shi), went on strike for one day on June 6th. Over a thousand grain merchants held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, industry and commerce circles in Suzhou and Changzhou also had actions against tax increases. By June 9th, industry and commerce circles in these areas, together with the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, jointly petitioned the Kuomintang Executive Yuan to protest, but to no avail. On June 17th, industry and commerce circles in these counties jointly protested again. On the same day, the "National Grain Industry Federation" also sent representatives to Nanjing to petition, but still without results. Wuxi's industry and commerce circles' tax resistance action began as early as the end of last December. In February of this year, they went on strike to protest the tax bureau's forced accounting checks. On May 21st, tax officials forcibly carried out accounting checks, which led to conflicts. Zhu Wenyuan, the deputy speaker of the county council, also acknowledged the heavy burden of Kuomintang taxes, saying: "In May alone, the commodity tax amounted to more than 180 billion yuan, averaging more than 6 billion yuan per day. However, Wuxi's industry and commerce are already in a state of semi-paralysis, and nine out of ten families in urban and rural areas are empty."

　　京沪沿线各城市工商界纷起抗税
    【新华社华东十六日电】据沪时与文杂志三卷十二期披露南京到上海铁路沿线各城市工商界纷起反抗国民党日益加重的苛捐杂税称：无锡米粮业为抗议国民党征收所谓“行商一时所得税”按货值抽百分之二十（即一石米要征二斗）的高税率，于六月六日罢市一天，粮商千余人并举行集会，商讨对策。与此同时，苏州和常州工商界亦有反抗增税的行动。至六月九日各该地工商界并联合镇江商会一起向国民党行政院请愿抗议，但毫无结果。六月十七日各该县工商界再度联合抗争，同日“全国粮业联合会”亦推派代表赴南京请愿，仍无结果。按无锡工商界此项抗税行动，早于去年十二月底开始，今年二月并因反对税局强迫查帐而举行罢工罢市，至五月二十一日税吏竟强制实行查帐，曾发生冲突。该县参议会副议长朱文沅亦承认国民党捐税的繁重，他说：“五月一个月单货物税一项即有一千八百多亿元，平均每天要摊六十多亿元，但无锡工商业早陷于半停状态，城乡人民十室九空。”
