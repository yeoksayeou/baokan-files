[Jinan Telegram] From late summer to early autumn, continuous rain and damp weather have led to the successive discovery of various insect plagues in fourteen counties in Southern Hebei. In the first district, the Yuanzhao first, fifth, and seventh districts have experienced a widespread outbreak of small yellow and white grubs that specifically eat the joints and hearts of corn plants. Any corn stalk that is attacked immediately withers and falls. Mole crickets have infested late cornfields in Yangcun. Niu Baocheng lost three-quarters of his four mu of land to the pests, and Niu Mingtang also lost a significant portion of his eight mu. In the third district, locust nymphs have been found in the Yaozhuang, Gaozhuang, and Tiantaishan areas of Feixiang's second and fourth districts. The larger ones are three to four fen long, and the smaller ones are about the size of a wheat seed. White moth eggs have been discovered on millet leaves in Macun in the first district; these turn into moths in three to five days and specifically eat millet and other late seedlings. Around Jiaozhuang, Nanguan, Dongcun, Hezhuang, and Danzhuang in Guangping's third district, corn borers were discovered around June 28th in the lunar calendar, mainly attacking corn seedlings and causing significant damage. In the eastern half of Jize's first district, crickets have been found in villages such as Wuguanying, Dongyukou, Yuanzhuang, Chengguanying, Liuzhuang, Liuguanying, and Xingdi. They emerge at night and eat the millet ears. In the most severely affected villages, two-thirds of the millet seedlings have been destroyed. In the fourth district, armyworms have been found on millet in many villages in Nangong's first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, with the fifth district being the worst affected, with more than ten worms, up to five fen long, on each millet ear. The millet leaves have already been half-eaten. In Jingxian's sixth district, Shilitang Village, in the fifth district, five qing and twenty-one mu of early corn have been infested with small white worms. Locusts have infested corn in Li Shouxian Village and Xiaofuzhuang in the Guandong ninth district. In Ji County, in addition to locusts in the first and third districts, honeyworms and armyworms have now appeared in seven districts. The affected area accounts for about half of the villages in the county and is still expanding. It is reported that white grubs have also been found around Xiaoxing in Wu Yi's seventh district. In the second district, armyworms have also been found in En County and around Guolimiao in Qinghe, and small white worms have infested sorghum, boring holes in the stalks, preventing the plants from producing grains. After the pests appeared in various places, many villagers have automatically started swatting them. Many district and village cadres are educating the masses, breaking down ideas such as "divine worms" and "the more you hit, the more they multiply," using the serious losses caused by the damaged crops and the fact that seedlings can be saved after pests are eliminated, leading the masses to eradicate the pests with all their might.

[Central Hebei Telegram] Armyworms have been found in Xinji, Zhao County, Shulu, Jin County, Ningjin in the eleventh district of Central Hebei, Shenze, Boye, Li County in the ninth district, and Jinghai in the eighth district. Locusts have been found around Nancaozhuang in Suning in the ninth district and Wuer Tou in Hejian in the eighth district. The Hebei Central Administrative Office has issued an urgent instruction to eliminate insects, pointing out that the current hot and humid weather is very suitable for the development of armyworms and locusts. If we do not maintain a high degree of vigilance, a serious insect plague will inevitably occur. In areas where pests have not been found, prevention efforts should be strengthened. Cadres and teachers should carefully study methods of eliminating pests, widely collect the experiences of veteran farmers, and publicize this information to the masses. The masses should be mobilized to conduct field inspections, and if pests are found, even if the area is small, leaders at all levels should grasp the situation in a timely manner and organize forces to eliminate them in a concentrated attack. Counties, districts, and villages in areas where insect plagues have been discovered can temporarily relax other work and concentrate all their efforts on leading the masses to capture and kill the pests. In the process of capturing and killing, joint action should be taken. Regardless of whether the pests occur on the land of a particular household or village, forces should be mobilized on the spot to eliminate them, breaking down the boundaries of households, villages, districts, and counties as needed. If losses that should not have occurred are suffered due to leadership negligence, or if the insect plague is allowed to spread and expand, responsibility will be investigated at each level.

[Chahar Telegram] Recently, armyworms have been found in parts of Wanxian, Tangxian, Wangdu, Yixian, Mancheng, and Xushui counties in Western Hebei, with Mancheng being more widespread. On the 7th of this month, the Fifth Prefectural Committee of the Northern Yue issued an urgent instruction, pointing out that quickly organizing the masses to eliminate insect plagues is a serious task for leaders at all levels. In areas with severe insect plagues, cadres should be concentrated, the existing experience of the local masses should be absorbed, and all mobilizable forces should be organized to eliminate the pests in a concentrated attack (other work may be suspended if necessary). In areas where insect pests have not yet been discovered, attention must be paid to inspection at all times, and agricultural information reporters should be established in each village to ensure timely detection and elimination.

  　冀南冀中冀西数十县虫灾严重
    【冀南电】夏末秋初，阴雨连绵，气候潮湿，冀南十四个县先后发现各种虫灾。一分区元朝一、五、七三个区普遍发生黄白两色小肉虫，专吃棒子节和心。凡被吃过的棒子，立即枯萎至倒。杨村晚棒子地发生蝼蛄，牛保成四亩地咬了四分之三，牛明堂八亩地也咬毁不少。三分区肥乡二、四区姚庄、高庄、天台山一带发现蝗蝻，大的三四分长，小的有一麦种长。一区麻村谷叶上发现白蛾生卵，三五天就变为飞蛾，专吃谷子棒子等晚苗。广平三区焦庄、南关、董村、贺庄、单庄一带，阴历六月二十八日发现钻心虫，以棒子苗上为最多，为害很大。鸡泽一区东半部吴官营、东于口、园庄、程官营、刘庄、刘官营、邢堤等村发现一种蟋蟀，一到晚上出来吃谷穗。受灾较重村庄，谷苗已咬了三分之二。四分区南宫一、三、四、五、六区不少村庄谷子上普遍发生黏虫，以五区为最严重，每个谷穗上有十余个，大的有五分长。现谷叶已被吃去一半。五分区景县六区十里唐村，有五顷二十一亩早棒子生了小白虫。关东九区李守先庄、小付庄棒子发生蝗虫。冀县除一、三区发生蝗虫外，现七个区又生了蜜虫黏虫。虫灾面积约占全县村庄二分之一，还在继续发展。据说武邑七区孝兴一带也发现白肉虫。二分区恩县和清河郭李庙一带也发现黏虫，高粱上发生小白虫，在秫秸上钻窟窿，有了此虫庄稼即不长籽粒。各地害虫发生后，许多村庄群众已自动开始扑打，不少区、村干部则以庄稼被害的严重损失和扑灭害虫后救活禾苗的事实，教育群众打破“神虫”“越打越多”等思想，领导群众全力灭虫。
    【冀中电】冀中十一专区辛集、赵县、束鹿、晋县、宁晋，九专区深泽、博野、蠡县及八专区静海等地均发现黏虫。九专区肃宁南曹庄一带及八专区河间务尔头等地发现蝗虫。冀中行署特发出紧急灭虫指示：指出目前天气湿热，颇适于黏虫、蝗虫的发展，如不加高度警惕，必将发生严重虫灾。在未发现害虫的地区，要加强预防，干部、教员应很好研究扑灭害虫的办法，广泛搜集老农经验，向群众宣传。动员群众进行田间检查，如有发现，即使面积很小，各级领导上也要及时掌握情况，组织力量突击扑灭。已发现虫灾地区的县、区、村，可暂时放松其他工作，集中全力领导群众捕打。在捕打中要联合行动，不论发生在那户那村的地里，都应根据情况，打破户、村、区、县的界线，调动力量就地扑灭。如因领导疏忽致遭受不应有之损失或使虫灾蔓延扩大时，要逐级追究责任。
    【察哈尔电】冀西完、唐、望、易、满、徐各县部分地区，近来先后发现黏虫，满城更为普遍。中共北岳五地委于本月七日发出紧急指示：指出迅速组织群众扑灭虫灾，是各级领导当前严重的任务。虫灾严重的地区，应集中干部力量，吸收当地群众已有的经验，组织一切能动员的力量突击灭虫（必要时可停止其他工作）。在尚未发现虫害地区，必须随时注意检查，建立各村农情报告员，作到及时发现及时消灭。
