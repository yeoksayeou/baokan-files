　　Purchase, Sale or Arranged Marriages Can Be Dissolved
    To the Editors:
    Many women in our county have requested to dissolve their marriage engagements. In general, these can be resolved according to policies and regulations. However, we are unsure how to resolve the dissolution of marriage engagements involving military dependents. We are writing to you with two specific cases for your review and answer.
    In 1942, during a famine in Xishan, Pei Sanyuan gave his daughter (who was only thirteen years old at the time) in marriage in exchange for more than one stone of grain. There was no formal engagement. In 1945, her fiancé joined the army and there has been occasional news, but he cannot return to marry her. Now the woman (nineteen years old) wants to dissolve the engagement, but the man's family disagrees and wants her to come to their house to live. However, the woman's family and the woman herself do not want to go.
    Peng Caixian of Qiuyuan, eighteen years old, was engaged to Lu Erming of Nanwang Village through her parents' arrangement. After the engagement, the man joined the army, deserted, and then returned to the ranks. However, it has been more than two years since he left, and there has been no news of him. The villagers do not treat her as a military dependent. Now the woman is requesting to dissolve the engagement. According to Article 7 of Chapter 3 of the Marriage Law, if there has been no news for more than two years, and the marriage was arranged by parents, it can be dissolved. Do you think this is appropriate?
    Regarding the first question, according to Article 7 of the law, although there has been news over the years, he cannot return to marry her. Although the woman is not over twenty years old, because the marriage was arranged by her parents and has the nature of a purchase marriage, and there was no formal engagement, how should the woman's request for dissolution be handled?

    △ Answer: Regarding the issue of military dependents dissolving their marriage engagements, we have asked Comrade Li Jian of the Higher People's Court to reply as follows:
    1. Pei Sanyuan gave his daughter in marriage during a famine because he had no food, and received one stone of grain in exchange. This shows that his daughter's marriage was not based on her own free will but contained elements of a purchase. Now that his daughter is unwilling to go to the man's house, she cannot be forced to do so. However, since the man provided grain to help the woman's family at the time, and the marriage is not going to happen, appropriate compensation should be given.
    2. If Peng Caixian's marriage was indeed arranged by her parents, and the man joined the army after the engagement, deserted, and then returned to the ranks, and there has been no news for more than two years, Peng Caixian's request to dissolve the engagement can be approved.

### 买卖或包办婚约可以解除

　　买卖或包办婚约可以解除
    编辑同志：
    我县有不少妇女提出解除婚约，一般的根据政策法令是可以解决的，但有有关军属的解除婚约问题不知怎样解决，兹将两件具体问题写给你们，请研究解答。
    西山裴三元一九四二年闹灾荒没吃的，将女儿（那时才十三岁）许出，吃过一石余粮食，没有订过婚，四五年她女婿参了军也不断有音信，但不能回来结婚，现在女方（十九岁）提出解除婚约，男方家人不同意，叫给他家送去过日子，但娘家和女方都不同意去。
    邱园彭彩仙十八岁，与南王村鹿二明是父母主婚，订婚后男人参了军，开小差回来又归队，但自走后二年多没有音信，不知下落，村人也不以军属待遇，现在女方提解除婚约。第二个问题按婚姻法令第三章第七条规定是音信毫无在二年以上者，又是父母主婚，是可以解除，你们看是否合适？
    第一个问题，按法令第七条规定，多年有音信不能回家结婚，虽女方未超过二十岁，但因是父母主婚又带买卖婚姻性质，又没有正式订过婚，女方提出解除该如何处理？
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　榆社县政府王执权、崔大申
    △答：关于军属解除婚约的问题，我们已请高等法院李鉴同志答复如下：
    一、裴三元在灾荒中因没吃的，将女儿许给人家，吃了人家一石粮，这说明了他女儿的婚姻并非出于自主自愿，而含有买卖性质的，现在他女儿既不愿到男方家去，自不能相强，不过当时男方既拿出了粮食救济了女方家里，亲戚既不成了，应当酌情予以补偿。
    二、彭彩仙的婚姻如确是父母包办，订婚后男人参军开了小差，归队后又二年多没音讯，彭彩仙提出解除婚约，可以批准。
