Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 2nd. The Central Plains People's Liberation Army captured two telegrams between bandit Chiang Kai-shek and Kang Ze when they captured Xiangyang. The original telegrams are as follows:

(1) Chiang Kai-shek's telegram to Kang Ze on July 13: Commander Kang: I have received your telegram of the 11th. The reinforcements from the north and south will arrive in Xiangyang no later than the 20th of this month. I, Zhongzheng, am responsible for urging them on, so do not worry. As for the bandit troops' equipment and battle situation mentioned in your telegram, in my judgment, the dangerous period has passed. The bandits are approaching the outer strongholds of Xiangyang, and the fierce fighting has lasted for several days and nights. The losses of the headquarters' offensive will be greater than our army's casualties. Moreover, the other side has no rear area for combat, and the supply of ammunition, according to past battle experience, the bandit troops' ammunition will definitely not last for three to five days. In particular, the replenishment of various artillery shells is even more lacking. In the past few days of fierce fighting, although their gun and artillery offensives have been very fierce, their artillery shells must have been exhausted due to the struggle for the outer territories. Moreover, the power of mountain guns cannot break through our solid city walls, can it? Therefore, if we are determined to retreat into the city and concentrate our forces to defend against the bandits' attack, we will be able to repel the bandits and ensure safety; sometimes we can even take the opportunity to turn to the offensive and annihilate the exhausted remnants; moreover, we have our air force coming to help day and night, which the bandits cannot match. However, all this depends on the wisdom and courage of the chief general. Throughout the hard-fought battles of the revolution, (illegible number) when the military and civilians were panicked, only relying on the chief general's (illegible number) calm command, after a period of time, it would naturally turn from danger to safety, and the general military and civilians would not know why. After experiencing this storm and overcoming this difficulty, not only will your courage and knowledge be greatly improved, but also your reputation and career will begin from this. As long as you trust my words, be firm and calm, no matter how fierce the bandits are, what can they do? What do you think, my brother? Zhongzheng hand-written, 13th day.

(2) Kang Ze's reply to Chiang Kai-shek: President Chiang of Nanjing: I have received your handwritten order via airplane on July 13. A, The bandits' offensive against Xiangyang has shifted from the mountains to the city walls. The battles on the east, south, and west sides of the city last night (13th) and the night before (12th) were extremely fierce. B, In order to concentrate forces, in accordance with your instructions, I will seek to defend the city. Starting at 13:00 on the 14th, the mountain troops will be transferred into the city. C, The military and civilians here are grateful for your majesty, and the morale of the soldiers and the hearts of the people are very high. I will uphold your teachings, (illegible number) be firm and calm, unite the military and civilians, strictly enforce rewards and punishments, and vow to achieve the mission of holding firm and awaiting reinforcements with the determination of either success or death. Please relieve your worries. Kang Ze, 14th day.

Xinhua News Agency reporter's note: The telegrams between Chiang Kai-shek and Kang Ze are typical records of how the Chinese fascist idiots deceive each other when they are heading towards their final demise. The Kuomintang bandit troops that Chiang Kai-shek "undertook to urge" to reinforce Xiangyang have not "arrived in Xiangyang" to this day. Only two days after Chiang Kai-shek "judged" that "the dangerous period had passed," and only one day after Kang Ze executed Chiang Kai-shek's "imperial handwritten order" to retreat into the city, which "will surely ensure safety," the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the city, and with a swift action of only five minutes, they ascended the "solid city walls" of Xiangyang, and after less than a day and night of ＠ battle, they completely annihilated Kang Ze's bandit troops. Kang Ze, who "trusted" Chiang Kai-shek the most, neither "turned from danger to safety" and "established a reputation and career" as Chiang Kai-shek guaranteed, nor did he "succeed or die for righteousness" as he himself vowed, but only hid in a group of corpses temporarily arranged in the basement and pretended to be a corpse for a while. Then, upon hearing that he was going to be beaten, he immediately obediently crawled up and became a prisoner. After being captured, Kang Ze actually opened his mouth and asked: "Does your department have a doctor? Will my arm be disabled?" This is indeed proof that Chiang Kai-shek's fascist disciple's "courage and knowledge have greatly improved after experiencing this storm." Superiors recklessly deceive their subordinates, and subordinates also recklessly deceive their superiors. Then, on July 22, the Nanjing Ministry of National Defense even more recklessly deceived the public, announcing that "Commander Kang Ze, who was firmly defending Dongguan, had gloriously died in battle." All of this is the truth about the internal and external relations of the Kuomintang army today.

### 两个蠢才丑相毕露  蒋贼康泽互相欺骗

    两个蠢才丑相毕露
    蒋贼康泽互相欺骗
    【新华社中原二日电】中原解放军在攻克襄阳时缴获匪首蒋介石、康泽在该城被围时来往电报各一份。原电如下：
    （一）蒋介石七月十三日致康泽电：康司令官：十一日电悉，南北两方援救最迟必于二十日前赶到襄阳，中正负责督促，勿念。至电中所述匪部装备与战况，以余判断，认为危险期限已将过去。匪逼近襄阳外围各据点，激战恶斗已达数昼夜，总部攻势之损失，将比我军伤亡更大。而且对方作战皆无后方，弹药之接济，照屡次战役之经验，匪部弹药决不能持久三日至五日时间。尤其各种炮弹之补充更为缺乏。在过去数日之激战，其枪炮攻势虽甚凶猛，但其炮弹必因争夺外围土地消耗将尽。何况山炮之威力，并不能轰破我坚固城墙耶？故此次如我决心退守城内，集中全力防御匪车来攻之办法，则必能击退匪部，确保安全；有时且可乘机转为攻势，歼灭疲乏之残队；何况有我空军昼夜前来助战，非匪之所能及也。惟此全视主将之智勇与决心而定。历来革命苦战之役，（数字不清）当军民惊慌失措之际，独赖主将（数字不清）指挥若定，则过一时期自必转危为安，一般军民亦不知其所以然也。吾弟经过此番风浪，渡过此一难关，以后不惟胆识可以因之大为长进，而且立名成业亦起于此矣。只要信赖余言，坚忍镇定，匪虽凶横，其如何乎弟以为如何？中正手启十三日。
    （二）康泽复蒋电：南京总统蒋：七月十三日御机手令电奉悉。甲、匪对襄阳攻势是由山地转到城垣。昨（十三）前（十二）两晚城东、南、西三面战况至为惨烈。乙、为集中兵力，遵照钧示求守，十四日十三时起，将山地部队转移城内。丙、此间军民感戴钧威，士气民心均甚奋发。职当仰体训诲，（数字不清）坚忍镇定，团结军民，严明赏罚，誓谨不成功便成仁之决心，期达固守待援之使命。祈释钧念。康泽十四日。
    新华社记者按：蒋介石与康泽的来往电报，是表明中国法西斯蠢才们在走向最后灭亡时如何互相欺骗的典型纪录之一。蒋介石所“负责督促”增援襄阳的国民党匪军，直至今日为止也没有“赶到襄阳”。仅在蒋介石“判断”“危险期限已将过去”的两天以后，仅在康泽执行蒋介石“必能确保安全”的“御机手令”退守城内的一天以后，人民解放军就发动攻城，仅以五分钟的迅速动作就登上了襄阳的“坚固城墙”，并经过不满一昼夜的＠战就全部歼灭了康泽匪部。最“信赖”蒋介石的康泽，既没有象蒋介石所保证的那样“转危为安”“立名成业”，也没有象他自己所发誓的那样“不成功便成仁”，而只是躲在地下室里临时布置的死尸群中装了一阵子死尸，随后听说要挨揍就立即乖乖地爬起来当了俘虏，康泽被俘后居然一开口就问：“贵部有医生没有？我的膀子该不会残废吧？”这确是蒋介石的法西斯大弟子“经过此番风浪”后“胆识因之大为长进”的证明。上司信口开河地欺骗他的下属，下属也同样信口开河地欺骗他的上司，然后南京国防部又在七月二十二日更加信口开河地欺骗社会公民，宣布“坚守东关之康泽司令官已在＠战中壮烈殉职”。这一切就是今天国民党军队对内对外关系的真相。
