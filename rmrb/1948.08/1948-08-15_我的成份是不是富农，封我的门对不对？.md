　　Is My Class Status as a Rich Peasant Correct? Was Sealing My Door Justified?
　　Xian County Seventh District, Fujiazhuang Village, Gong Guangcai
　　Comrade Editor:
　　My name is Gong Guangcai, and I am 57 years old. I am from Fujiazhuang Village, Seventh District, Xian County. I have a question for you to answer. My family was very poor when I was young. I had to beg for food. The ten or so mu of land we had were flooded and could not be cultivated. When I was eight years old, my father fell ill. At that time, my eldest brother was twenty, my second brother was eighteen, both working as long-term laborers away from home. My eldest sister was eleven, my younger brother was three, and my mother was forty-two, working as a wet nurse for other families. My sister, brother, and I begged for food. My father, seeing that he was sick and unable to beg, and without money for treatment, and that the food we begged was not enough for ourselves, let alone to support him, committed suicide. He left behind my mother and us five children. A few years later, my eldest brother earned some money and bought me a wooden machine for weaving belts. I was just twelve years old and started weaving belts. After two years, I became better at it, and I also cultivated ten or so mu of land. My family no longer had to beg. At nineteen, I went to Guan Dong and worked as a porter in Heihe. After six years, I went to a mill in Qiqihar to grind flour. After two years, I bought a boat and transported goods for others. After three years, I went to Nenjiang County to burn charcoal for two years, and then worked as a sawyer for one year. When my younger brother was nineteen, he also went out to work. My brothers and I were working away from home, and there were no men to work on the farm, so we hired a long-term laborer. After two years, we found it difficult to continue hiring, so we had to farm with my elder sister's husband. After two years, I returned home and led my children, wife, and mother in farming and weaving belts. Each year we had some surplus, so we bought land. In the years before the incident, I had about forty mu of land and hired a long-term laborer for two years (one person). After the incident, I and Gong Xiaowai jointly bought a weaving machine and switched from weaving belts to weaving cloth. At first, only one person in my family knew how to weave, but later my sons and daughters all learned how. The machines and spinning wheels ran non-stop all day long, and our family's life improved. Each year we had some surplus. In the years 1944 and 1945, I hired a long-term laborer. In 1944, because I failed to report the yield of my five fen of jujube orchard, I was fined eleven mu and six fen of land, including ten mu and four fen of second-grade land and one mu and two fen of fourth-grade land. I still had twenty-nine mu and four fen of land. Last year, my class status was determined to be that of a rich peasant, and I was required to pay 1,160 jin of millet as public grain, plus village burdens. On the thirteenth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the village detained me and sealed my house, leaving my family of five with only two sheng of sorghum per day, to be collected every few days. On the twenty-first day of the first lunar month this year, I was released. On the twenty-seventh, the sealed items were returned, but no grain was left. My entire family had to beg for food. Later, I was made to hand over eight mu and four fen of wheat land, five mu and four fen of garden land, and five fen of jujube orchard land. I still have three mu and three fen of wheat land and eleven mu and six fen of idle land. I didn't stop begging until after the wheat harvest. In my village, the average landholding is more than four mu and five fen per person, while my family has only three mu per person. Now I want to ask you, am I a rich peasant? I have worked hard all my life. No one in my family is idle. I am willing to help the poor to stand up because I come from a poor peasant background. I strongly support the equal distribution of land. Why am I being treated as an enemy? When I was begging for food, people were afraid to give me food openly. Relatives and friends would secretly bring me things at night. My wife and I were in tears all day long. My children said to me, "Who told you to be unwilling to eat or spend money, only knowing how to make us work?" "In the summer, I weave one cloth a day, and you still say I don't weave enough." The village meetings don't let me attend. I have no place to speak. My son was expelled from the militia. I really can't bear this rich peasant label! Now, even growing crops is not enough to eat, and it's difficult to get capital for the weaving machine.
　　When I was gathering firewood in the fields, Gong Fuquan said to me, "If you keep working like this, you'll be made to face the sky and have your spine broken into pieces!" He looked at me, smiled, and left. Now I'm worried, thinking about what he meant. Will I be dealt with in the future? These words have been buried in my heart for a long time, and I haven't dared to say them. Now, an old fellow villager came and told me that there is a People's Daily, a place for us common people to speak. Even if you don't say it well, it won't cause any trouble. So, I am telling you what is in my heart, hoping to receive a letter in response.

　　Regarding the issue of whether Gong Guangcai's class status was wrongly determined, we hope that the Xian County Party Committee will promptly investigate after seeing this report and resolve it according to the standards set by the Party Central Committee. If his class status was indeed wrongly determined, and land and property were confiscated as a result, his class status should be corrected and compensation should be provided in accordance with the Party's policy regulations. Even if his class status is still that of a rich peasant, according to the Land Law Outline, only his surplus land and property can be confiscated. If Gong Guangcai did not engage in any activities to sabotage the land reform during the land reform period, detaining him and sealing his door was wrong and should be explained to him. If the land and property retained in the past are far apart, appropriate supplementary arrangements should also be made. His weaving machine and other handicraft production tools should also be returned to him. In particular, it should be explained to him that the land reform has been completed and that there will be no more struggles in the future, so there is no need to be afraid.

### 我的成份是不是富农，封我的门对不对？

　　我的成份是不是富农，封我的门对不对？
    献县第七区富家庄村  巩广材
    编辑同志：
    我叫巩广财，今五十七岁，献县第七区富家庄村人，我有一个问题，请你答复。我自小家里很穷，在外要饭，家里有十来亩地被水淹了不能种。八岁时我的父亲生病，这时我大哥二十岁，二哥十八岁，都在外面扛长工，大姐十一岁，兄弟三岁，母亲四十二岁，给人家当奶母，我和大姐、弟弟在外要饭。我父亲看见他自己生病不能去要饭，同时又没有钱不能治病，我们要来的饭自己也不够吃饱，还得要养活他，他自己就寻了死路。留下了我们母子六人。过了几年，大哥赚了一点工钱，给我买了一架织带子的木机，我刚十二岁，就织带子，过了两年头较好，我又种了十来亩地，家里的人也不去要饭了。十九岁时，我到了关东，在黑河卖苦力。过了六年，又到齐齐哈尔磨坊推磨，过二年以后，我自己买了一只船，给别人运脚，过三年，又去嫩江县烧炭二年，以后又拉锯一年。我兄弟十九岁时，也出了门。我弟兄都在外面做工，家里没有男人劳动，就雇了一个长工，二年后觉得困难，不能再雇，只好和大姐夫在一块合伙种地。过了二年，我就回了家，领着我的孩子老婆和我娘种地织带子为业。每年都能余积，就购买土地，到事变的前几年，我已有四十来亩土地，雇了二年长工（一个），事变以后我和巩小歪合伙买了一架织布机，把织带子改成织布。开始家里只有一人会织，后我小子闺女都学会织了，机子纺车整天不停，家里生活从此就好起来，每年还有余积。民国三十三四年雇了个长工，三十三年因我有五分枣林地没报产量，罚了我十一亩六分土地，其中二等地十亩零四分，四等地一亩二分，我自己还有二十九亩四分地。去年把我的成份定成富农，交纳一千一百六十斤小米的公粮，村里的负担在外。去年腊月十三日，村里把我扣起来，把我家的门封了，给我家的五口人留下每天二升高粱，吃几天要几天。今年正月二十一日，把我放了出来，二十七日把封起来的东西拾掇了，一点粮食也没给留，我全家大小只得在外要饭吃，以后叫我出了八亩四分麦子地，五亩四分园子地，五分枣林地，我自己还有三亩三分麦子地，十一亩六分闲地，麦收后我才不要饭了。我村里每人平均四亩五分多地，我家每人只有三亩。我现在要问你，我是不是富农？我自己劳动了一辈子，我家里没个吃闲饭的人，我家里有些余积，叫我帮助穷人翻身，我很愿意，因我出身是贫农，平分土地我极赞成，为什么把我当敌人看待呢？我在外要饭吃的时候，人家别人就不敢给我，给我饭吃要背着别人，亲戚朋友到黑夜里给我送点东西，我老两口子整天流着眼泪，孩子们对我说：“谁叫你平时舍不得吃、舍不得花、只知道叫我们劳动呢？”“在夏天里我一天织一个布，还说我织得少。”村里的会也不叫我参加，我没个说话的地方，小子当民兵也开除了，这富农帽子我真戴不起呀！现在种地也不够吃，还有一架织布机，织布本钱也困难。
    我在地里拾柴火，巩福全对我说：“你再劳动将来要叫你鼻子朝天脊梁骨寸地哩！”他看了我一眼，笑着走了。我现在担心，想起他这话的意思，将来还要拾掇我哩？这些话在我心坎里埋伏很久了，我不敢说。现在有个老乡亲来，他告我说有个人民日报，是咱老百姓说话的地方，说的不好，也害不了事，我就把我心里的话告你，希望给我来封信吧！
    　☆　☆　☆　☆
    　巩广财的成份是否错订等问题，我们希望献县县委见报后迅速调查，按照党中央规定的标准予以解决。如确系错订成份，因此而被没收土地财产，应按党的政策规定，改正成份并设法补偿。即使成份仍系富农，按照土地法大纲规定，也只能征收他多余土地财产，如巩广财在土改期间，无破坏土改的行为，把他扣起并封了门，是不对的，可向他解释。若过去所留土地财产相差太远，亦应予以适当补足安置。他的织布机及其他手工业生产工具也应退还他。特别应该向他说明：土改已经完成，以后决不再斗，不必害怕。
