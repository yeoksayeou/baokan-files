　　Obey Commands, Cherish the Wounded, Help the Masses with Production:
　　Huolu Laborers Return Home Victoriously

　　[Report from this newspaper] The Huolu labor stretcher team of more than 500 people has now returned, carrying the victory banner. On August 9th, the county held a celebration meeting to commend their heroic deeds of fighting side-by-side on the front lines. The Second and Third Companies and Comrade Han Yinde and five other meritorious individuals were awarded prizes on the spot. This stretcher team that went on an expedition to the front lines had launched a widespread emulation campaign when it departed from the county on July 7th. Their slogans were "Go wherever we say, do whatever we say," "Obey commands, cherish the wounded, and help the masses with production," and "We will not return home without completing the task and carrying back the banner." During the Xushui battle, in order to complete the task successfully, they marched continuously for more than a hundred *li* (approx. 30 miles) in one day and one night. At that time, they were responsible for transferring personnel at the supply station. Later, when the troops attacked the city, wounded soldiers could not be brought down from the front lines. The first platoon of the Third Company of laborers raced to the front lines to rescue them. The Third and Fourth Companies then joined in. They braved heavy rain and waded through knee-deep water to run dozens of *li* in the dark to complete the task. They took great care of the wounded. On one occasion, during transport, team member Han Yinde used his hands and hemp leaves to catch the excrement of a severely wounded soldier. After the soldier sacrificed himself at the station, he washed his body, dressed him, and buried him properly. Comrade Nie Hailin used his own blanket to shield a wounded soldier from the rain, and Wang Xunbao and others used their own clothes and towels to cover the wounds of the soldiers, and even bought cigarettes for them to smoke. Zhao Lianyun and others from the third squad of the first company took off their own jackets to pad the stretchers for severely wounded soldiers, reducing their pain. Deputy Instructor Li Liuni personally fed wounded soldiers noodles and eggs at the station, and comforted them. Zhang Wanjing bought five hundred yuan worth of fruit for the wounded soldiers at one time. The whole team voluntarily bought things to comfort the wounded, totaling more than 10,000 yuan. The laborers on the front lines also had very harmonious relationships with the residents. They truly achieved the "three not leaving" policy: they would not leave without making everything clear, they would not leave without filling the water tanks, and they would not leave without cleaning up. On July 10th, Wu Yuanhong and Wu Jucai's squad helped the masses in the front to push more than ten carts of manure, grind a *dou* (peck) of flour, and water one *mu* (acre) of garden. On the 27th, they helped the masses in the village pick cotton buds on four *mu*. Si Xixiang and Li Gouqun each wove half a bolt of cloth and five *liang* (1/4 kg) of thread for the masses, and also repaired two looms. The four companies of the team helped the masses in the front to haul and transport 372 carts of manure, carry 140 loads of manure, and water, hoe, and top-dress a total of 75.7 *mu* of land. They also picked cotton buds, tobacco buds, and turned sweet potatoes on a total of 24.4 *mu*, plastered three rooms, and dug one cellar. They also did a lot of other odd jobs such as pushing mills and carrying water. There were also individual laborers who infringed on the interests of the masses, such as Niu Guishan, who took three *chi* (approx. 1 meter) of white cloth from a landlord. After being discovered, he not only compensated at the market price but also apologized.

　　During the month or so on the front lines, the leaders, from Captain Gao Da to Political Commissar Wei, to the company and platoon cadres, generally cared for the team members. During marches, they personally helped the team members carry luggage, carry large poles, carry the sick across the river, and carry stretchers (individual cadres who were not good were strictly criticized). Therefore, the whole team was very solid. Although there were constant cases of illness, only a very small number of laborers deserted, and it never affected the successful completion of any combat missions. (Bai Qing, Guang Ming)

　　听指挥爱护伤员帮助群众生产
  　获鹿民工胜利还乡
    【本报讯】五百多人的获鹿民工担架大队，现在扛着胜利的奖旗回来了。八月九日，县里召开庆功大会，表扬他们在前线并肩战斗的英勇事迹，二、三连及功臣韩阴德等六位同志当场受奖。这支远征前线的担架队，上月七日由县出发时，就曾开展普遍的立功竞赛。他们的口号是“说到那里，做到那里。”“听指挥，爱护伤员，帮助群众生产”，“不完成任务，不扛回大旗，不回家。”徐水战斗中，他们为了圆满的完成任务，曾在一天一夜连续行军百余里。当时他们是在兵站担任转送，以后部队登城了，火线伤员下不来，三连一排的民工就争先赶赴火线抢运。接着三、四两个连也参加了。他们冒着大雨，淌着没膝的大水在黑夜里连续几十里的跑步去完成任务。他们对伤员照顾很周到。有一次，在担运途中，队员韩阴德用双手垫上大麻叶给重伤员接屎。到站后伤员牺牲了，他又给洗净身驱，穿好衣服，把他好好埋葬了。聂海林同志在大雨中用自己的被子给伤员遮雨，王训保等用自己的衣服手巾给伤员盖伤口，还给伤员买纸烟抽。一连三班赵连云等脱下自己身上穿的褂子给重伤员垫担架，使伤员减少痛苦。副指导员李六妮在站上亲自喂伤员挂面鸡子，给伤员说宽心话。张万景一次给伤员买了五百元的果子。全队个人自发买东西慰问伤员的有一万余元，在前线民工们和居民的关系也非常融洽。他们真正做到了三不走：即交代不清不走，挑不满缸不走，打扫不净不走。吴元红、吴聚才班，七月十日帮助前方群众推粪十余车、磨面一斗，浇园一亩。廿七日又帮助这村群众打棉花尖四亩。司喜祥、李狗群各给群众织布半匹，打线五两，还修理好两张织布机。该队四个连共帮助前方群众出粪运粪三七二车，担粪一四○担，浇地、锄地、追肥共七五点七亩，打棉花尖、烟尖、翻红薯共二四点四亩，抹房三间，挖地窑一座。其他如推碾、担水等杂活也做得不少。民工中也有个别侵犯群众利益，如牛贵山拿了房东三尺白布，经发觉后，除照市价赔偿外，还进行道歉。
    在前线一个多月中，由于领导上从高大队长、魏政委到连排等干部，一般都很爱护队员，在行军中亲自帮助队员背行李，扛大杆，背病号过河和抬担架（个别干部不好的进行了严格批评），因此全队很巩固。虽然不断有病号，但民工逃亡只是极少数，始终没有影响圆满的完成任何战斗任务。（柏青、光明）
