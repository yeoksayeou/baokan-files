[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] A reporter from this branch summarized the development of the military struggle between the enemy and us in the area south of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region over the past six months, stating: The area south of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region (i.e., the triangular area north of the Longhai Railway, west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and between Kaifeng, Xuzhou, and Jinan) can be divided into three periods in terms of the struggle between the enemy and us over the past six months. Last winter, following our army's large-scale sabotage war on the Longhai Railway between Kaifeng and Xuzhou, we advanced to the west side of the Grand Canal and recovered Dongping City. At that time, except for the areas of Heze, Jinxiang, and Yutai, which were still occupied by the enemy, the vast majority of the remaining areas were under our control, and the east and west areas of the Grand Canal, which had been blockaded and divided by the enemy, were restored to contact. In March, our army, in coordination with the Shandong Liberation Army's Zhoucun, Boshan, and Zhangdian campaign in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, advanced to the west of Tai'an and the east bank of the Grand Canal for the second time, recovering the three cities of Dong'a, Feicheng, and Pingyin. At the same time, another unit raided the bandit Shandong 2nd Security Brigade and other units in the Wangkoushan and Jianshan areas near Pingyin, annihilating more than 200 of them, and the bandits fled back to Jinan. At the same time, the 139th Brigade of the bandit 70th Division, which had invaded the Jinxiang Caomaji area, was afraid of being annihilated and hurriedly shrank back to Jinxiang. By this point, most of the areas originally invaded by the enemy had been recovered. This was the first period. From early April to June 3, it was the most tense stage of the enemy's "mopping-up" and our counter-"mopping-up" war in the Henan area. At the beginning of April, the enemy, mainly its 5th Division, gathered about 13 brigades from the 70th Division, the 55th Division, and the 68th Division, as well as more than 15,000 local teams from Dingtao, Cao County, and Juye, and launched continuous "mopping-up" operations in our Chengwu, Shanxian, Dingtao, and Juye areas in five routes, lasting for 45 days. Our army relied on the masses and maneuvered flexibly to fight with the enemy, inflicting great casualties on the enemy. In April, a unit of our army successively blocked the invading bandit 70th Division and other units in Xingji, Da Xiao Qilou, Yangshan, and other places in Shan County, annihilating a total of 640 bandits below the deputy regiment commander and battalion commander. On the night of May 7, we captured the bandit stronghold of Changgou, 35 miles north of Jining, captured 175 members of the puppet Jining local team and township office, killed and wounded 32 people, and controlled the Wannan and Jibei areas. From April 23 to May 11, the enemy, with brigades as units and local bandits and puppets, implemented zonal "suppression" and formed a checkerboard pattern for division. In order to smash the enemy's attempt to encircle and suppress us and support the struggle in the hinterland, our army launched mobile operations. On May 20, a unit of our army smashed the enemy's encirclement and suppression of more than 1,000 people in the Mengzhai area of Shan County. Another unit destroyed the puppet township and bao regime in the Yangshan area, smashing the enemy's attempt to gradually compress, "garrison," and "encircle and suppress." At this time, the enemy again gradually encroached on our inland areas with battalions as units, and adopted "combing" style "net-like encirclement and suppression" and "night raids" and "surprise attacks" in an attempt to eliminate our army. Our army adopted the policy of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance," and successively annihilated more than 320 bandits in Wangdian, Taoyuan, and other places under Pei County. The defeated enemy, inhumanely, adopted extermination methods such as poisoning and arson. Our local cadres and local armed forces and militias adopted the strategy of persisting in tunnels and cave dwellings when the enemy was mopping up on the ground; when the enemy was active during the day, we carried out propaganda and condolences to the masses at night. Kaocheng, Dingtao, Shan County, and other places have always adhered to the struggle of not leaving the county or the district, and all the enemy's invasions have finally been smashed by us. During this period, our army fought the enemy more than 150 times, annihilating more than 1,100 bandits. This was the second period. In early June, our local troops cooperated with the main force in the battle and completely annihilated the enemy's 29th Brigade logistics battalion and the entire 86th Regiment of the 55th Division south of Juan (Cheng), and defeated two brigades of bandits who came to reinforce from Heze, killing and capturing more than 1,900 enemies, giving the enemy in Heze a severe blow. The bandits in Wenshang and Jining became increasingly isolated, and our army smoothly defended the wheat harvest of the masses. Then, our army, in coordination with the Shandong Field Army, launched an offensive on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, capturing bandit strongholds such as Kuahushan, Yuhuangshan, Wangkoushan, Guangli, and Gongzhuang, and recovering Ningyang City. In mid-June, when our Liberation Army arrived at the city of Kaifeng, our army, after recovering Dongming, contained the enemy's 96th Brigade and 200th Brigade of the 5th Division, which were reinforcing Kaifeng from the west, for a week on the Zhang Fenghu, Huayuan, Yangzhuang, and Lizhuang line south of Ju (Ye), repelling their several fierce attacks. On June 19, our army intercepted Liu Ruming's troops, who were reinforcing Kaifeng, on the He (Ze) and Kao (Cheng) line; on the 20th, in the Matouji area, it defeated part of its 81st, 29th, and 54th Brigades, directly cooperating with the Kaifeng battle. When our army launched the great annihilation battle in eastern Henan, another unit of our army destroyed the Shang (Qiu) and Dang (Shan) sections of the Longhai Railway, blocking the enemy's 74th Division for three days, preventing the enemy from reinforcing the west. When our army captured a certain place on the Tianjin-Pukou front line, the enemies in Jining, Wenshang, Jinxiang, Yutai, Fengxian, and Pei County, fearing being annihilated, all abandoned their cities and fled south. At this point, the enemy and our situation south of the Yellow River has changed greatly. Now, in the area south of the Yellow River, except for the five counties of Changqing, Feicheng, Yucheng, Dangshan, and Heze, which are still occupied by the enemy, the rest have been recovered by our army. Looking at the struggle over the past six months, our army's local armed forces have persisted in the struggle independently for a long time, smashing the enemy's long-term continuous "encirclement and suppression" and "joint attack" by 13 brigades and more than 15,000 local troops, making the enemy's dream of eliminating our army and destroying our Henan guerrilla base area a failure. Our increasingly powerful army is now fighting heroically to completely eliminate the remaining enemies and recover all lost land.

　　坚持阵地战胜敌人
  　冀鲁豫黄河南岸军民半年奋战经过
    【冀鲁豫电】分社记者综述冀鲁豫区黄河以南地区半年来敌我军事斗争发展经过称：冀鲁豫黄河以南地区，（即陇海路以北，津浦路以西，开封、徐州、济南之间的三角地带。）半年来敌我斗争可分为三个时期：去冬我军继陇海路开封、徐州间大规模破袭战之后，复挺进运河西侧，收复东平城，当时除菏泽、金乡、鱼台一带尚为敌盘据外，其余广大地区即全入我掌握，被敌人封锁分割之运河东西地区，又恢复联系。三月间，我军配合山东解放军胶济线中段周村、博山、张店战役，二次进至泰安西、运河东岸作战，收复了东阿、肥城、平阴三城。同时，另部奔袭平阴附近望口山，尖山一带匪山东保二旅等部，先后歼其二百余名，匪即窜回济南。同时窜犯金乡曹马集一带之匪整七十师一三九旅，慑于被歼，亦急忙缩回金乡。至此原被敌侵扰之地区，即大部恢复。此为第一时期。四月上旬至六月三日，是河南区敌“扫荡”我反“扫荡”战争最紧张阶段，四月初敌以其整五师为主，集结整七十师，整五十五师，整六十八师等约十三个旅兵力，及定陶、曹县、巨野等地地方团队一万五千余人，分五路向我城武、单县、定陶、巨野等地连续“扫荡”，为时四十五天之久。我军依靠群众，机动灵活与敌周旋，予敌很大杀伤。我军一部四月间先后在单县属于兴集、大小齐楼、羊山等地，阻击进犯蒋匪整七十师等部，共歼匪副团长及营长以下六百四十名。五月七日夜我克济宁北三十五里之长沟匪据点，俘伪济宁地方团队及乡公所一百七十五人，毙伤三十二人，控制了汶南、济北地区。四月二十三日至五月十一日，敌以旅为单位配以地方匪伪，实行分区“驻剿”，并构成棋盘格式进行分割。我军为粉碎敌合击企图与支持腹地斗争，即展开机动作战。五月二十日，我军某部于单县孟砦一带粉碎敌千余人之合击，另部摧毁了羊山一带伪乡保政权，粉碎了敌逐步压缩和“驻剿”“合击”的企图，这时敌又以营为单位，向我内地逐步蚕食，采取“梳篦”式的“拉网合击”及“夜袭”“奔袭”等，企图消灭我军，我军采取“敌进我进，敌不进我也进”的方针，先后于沛县属之王店、桃园等地歼匪三百二十余人。遭受挫败之敌，残无人道，竟采取放毒、放火等灭绝人性的毁灭办法，我当地干部及地武、民兵，则采取敌在地面清剿，我在地道、窑洞坚持；敌人白天活动我则夜间向群众宣传，进行慰问。考城、定陶、单县等地，均始终坚持了县不离县，区不离区的斗争，敌人的一切进犯，终于均被我粉碎。此一时期我军与敌作战一百五十余次，歼匪一千一百余人，此为第二个时期。六月初，我地方部队协同主力作战，于鄄（城）南全歼敌整五十五师二九旅辎重营及八十六团全部，并击溃由菏泽增援之匪两个旅，毙俘敌一千九百余人，给菏泽之敌以严重打击，汶上、济宁之匪日趋孤立，我军遂顺利的保卫了群众麦收。接着我军配合山东野战军，对津浦线发动攻势，攻克跨虎山、玉皇山、望口山、广里、弓庄等匪据点，并收复宁阳城，六月中旬当我解放大军莅临开封城下时，我军继收复东明之后，又在巨（野）南张凤榘、花园、杨庄、李庄一线，牵制西援开封之敌整五师九十六旅、二百旅等一星期之久，击退其数次猛攻。六月十九日，我军又于菏（泽）、考（城）线截击向开封增援之敌刘汝明部；廿日，于马头集一带，将其八十一、二十九、五十四等旅击溃一部，直接配合了开封作战。当我大军展开豫东大歼灭战时，另部我军破坏陇海路商（邱）、砀（山）段，阻击敌整七十四师三天之久，使敌不得西援。及至津浦前线我军攻克某某时，济宁、汶上、金乡、鱼台、丰县、沛县之敌，惟恐被歼，均弃城南窜。至此，黄河南岸敌我形势大为改观。现在黄河以南地区，除长清、肥城、虞城、砀山、菏泽五县尚为敌人盘据外，余均为我军收复。综观半年来的斗争，我军地方武装曾长期单独坚持斗争，粉碎了敌人十三个旅与一万五千多地方部队的长期连续“清剿”、“合击”，使敌企图消灭我军、毁灭我河南游击根据地之美梦，沦于破灭。日益强大之我军，刻正为全部消灭残敌、收复一切失地而英勇战斗。
