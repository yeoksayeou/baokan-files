　　Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee Directs All Counties
  　To Fully Prepare for Autumn Cultivation and Planting
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric Dispatch] In order to implement the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and Party rectification work in 1948, and to solve the current urgent production issues, the Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee recently issued a notice, stating in brief: All levels of Party committees must vigorously and actively complete all preparations for going to the countryside in September as decided by the District Party Committee's August meeting, in order to "set in motion the hand of production" in September and fully carry out autumn harvesting, autumn cultivation, and autumn planting work, so as to conclude this year's production and prepare for next year's major production. The following urgent production issues must be addressed: (1) We are currently in the rainy season, with a sharp increase in rainfall. The Wei River north of the Yellow River and the Si River in Henan have both risen, with breaches in some places. There is also a significant accumulation of water in low-lying areas inland, which is flooding autumn crops and hindering wheat planting. We must actively build dikes to prevent floods and open ditches to drain water in order to facilitate autumn cultivation and wheat planting. (2) We must ensure the elimination of wasteland during autumn cultivation and wheat planting. (3) In order to do a good job in autumn cultivation and planting, as well as preparing for next year's major production, we should vigorously promote the accumulation of fertilizer and compost, and promote the cutting of green grass to accumulate green manure. The Ninth Prefectural Committee has recently paid more attention to this aspect, and it is hoped that all localities will also pay attention to it. (4) Promote the purchase of livestock to increase animal power and facilitate autumn cultivation and planting. And promote raising pigs and sheep to accumulate fertilizer for production.

　　冀鲁豫区党委指示各县
  　全力准备秋耕秋种
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区党委为了贯彻中央关于一九四八年土改与整党工作的指示，解决当前有关生产工作上的迫切问题，特于日前发出通知、略称：区党委八月会议决定的九月下乡前的一切准备工作，各级党委必须用大力积极准备完毕，以便九月下乡“动生产之手”，全力进行秋收、秋耕、秋种工作，以结束今年的生产，准备明年的大生产。对当前有关生产工作上的迫切问题，必须注意解决：（一）目前正值雨季，雨量激增，黄河北之卫河，河南之泗水均涨，有的地方已决口，内地低洼之处，也存不少积水，秋禾被淹，妨害种麦。我们必须积极筑堤防汛，开渠疏水，以便秋耕种麦。（二）要在秋耕种麦时保证消灭荒地。（三）为了作好秋耕、秋种，以及准备明年大生产，应大力提倡积肥沤粪，提倡割青草积绿肥。最近九地委在这一方面比较注意，希各地也同样引起注意。（四）提倡购买牲口，增加畜力，便利秋耕秋种。并提倡喂猪养羊积肥生产。
