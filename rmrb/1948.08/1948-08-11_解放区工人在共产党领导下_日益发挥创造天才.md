Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 9th: A comprehensive report: Workers in various liberated areas are increasingly displaying their creativity, with various technological innovations and improvements emerging one after another. In North China: When a factory in Shijiazhuang was producing a slurry filter, it lacked extremely thin washing knives. After An Huaqing, a worker in the factory's washing bed, devoted himself to research, he created washing knives made from modified iron steel, which solved a major difficulty for the factory. In Xinji, Hebei Province, a worker in a steel factory created a tool for manufacturing wire nails. The products were no different from foreign products, and the output was also large, which not only benefited the people but also reduced a large amount of foreign exchange expenditure. Wang Fengzhang, a worker at the Hongye Iron Factory in Botou, created a hand-cranked steel mill, which was simple and practical, and was greatly welcomed by the masses. Foundry worker Li Tingzhen researched using "furnace ash" to replace coke powder in the "furnace hearth," saving 30 catties of coke each time. In the Northwest: A worker named Zhang Fengshan, in order to solve the difficulty of manufacturing batteries due to a lack of graphite powder, created a method of using soot from chimneys and heating it to high temperatures to replace graphite powder. After many trials, this graphite powder was even better than that produced in Fengzhen. In the Northeast: Wang Fengcai, a miner at the Northeast No. 2 Coal Mine, made a breakthrough in coal mining, with an average daily coal output of more than 0.8 tons (the average daily coal output of ordinary workers is only 0.5 tons). In public utilities in Harbin, Shi Zhongliang, a worker in a factory, changed the double-pull double-line hoist to a double-pull single-line hoist in order to save antennas, saving a large amount of material.

In newly liberated cities, workers are even more actively displaying their creativity for the people with boundless labor enthusiasm. After the workers of the Luoyang Railway Engineering Brigade repaired the Luoyang to Heishiguan section of the Longhai Railway with astonishing efficiency, the workers of the machine factory then, under extremely difficult conditions of manpower and material resources, converted four old automobile heads into light locomotives, enabling the Luoyang-Heishiguan section to be opened to traffic quickly; moreover, the train ran extremely smoothly, was very fuel-efficient, and the locomotive's horsepower consistently maintained a speed of one li per minute, and could travel at 80-90 li per hour at faster speeds. This arduous task was successfully created by four workers in more than 20 days of research. Liu Tongxuan, a staff member of the Dahua Match Factory in Weifang, after searching the mountains and ridges for many days and conducting several experiments in order to find a substitute for imported grindstone rollers, finally discovered a completely suitable stone, which solved the difficulty of sourcing grindstone rollers. In order to rush the production of military uniform buttons, Liu Weixin, a worker in the copper jewelry industry, created a small press for making button noses after painstaking research. In the past, each worker could make 200 buttons per day, but with this machine, they could make 13,000 buttons, increasing production by 65 times. In a cotton spinning factory in the newly recovered area of Southern Liaoning, during the production increase campaign, worker Li Zhengcai modified the billet of the fine spinning machine spindle, increasing production by 30 percent. These facts prove that only under the correct leadership of the Communist Party can laborers truly unleash their creative genius.

　　解放区工人在共产党领导下
  　日益发挥创造天才
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导：解放区各地工人，日益发挥其创造性，各种技术上的创造与改良，纷纷出现。在华北：石家庄某厂制作滤浆机时，缺乏极薄的洗刀，经该厂洗床工人安华清专心研究，创造出利用铁钢改制的洗刀，给厂中解决了很大困难。冀中辛集，某铁厂一工人创造了制造洋钉的工具，产品和外来品无异，产量也大，不仅便利人民，且减少了大量外汇的支出。泊头宏业铁工厂工人王凤章创造了手摇钢磨，简单适用，受到群众极大欢迎。翻砂工人李廷臻研究用“炉灰”代替焦炭末“膛炉”，每次可省焦煤三十斤。在西北：某厂工人张凤山为了解决制造电池缺乏石墨粉的困难，便创造出以烟囱内的煤烟，加以高温，来代替石墨粉，经过多次试用，这种石墨粉比丰镇所产者还好。在东北：东北第二煤矿矿工王凤才突击挖煤，平均每日挖煤量在零点八吨以上（一般工人平均每日挖煤量仅零点五吨）。哈市公用企业中，某厂工人施中亮为节省天线，将双拉双线吊改为双拉单线吊，节省了大量材料。
    在新解放的城市里，工人们更以无限的劳动热忱，为人民积极发挥着他们的创造性。洛阳铁路工程大队工人以惊人的效率修复了陇海路洛阳至黑石关段后，机器厂工人便接着在人力物力极端困难条件下，以四个旧汽车头改装成轻便火车头，使洛黑段得以很快通车；且车行极为平稳，又很省油，车头的马力还始终保持着每分钟一华里的速度，较快时每小时可行八九十华里。这个艰巨任务，便是由四个工人在二十多天的钻研中创造成功的。潍坊大华火柴厂职员刘桐轩，为了研究外来磨刀摇石的代用品，经多日翻山越岭的寻求和若干次的试验，终于发现一种完全合用的石头，使磨刀摇石来源的困难得以解决。铜手饰业工人刘维新为了赶制军衣扣子，经苦心研究，创造出做扣鼻的小压力机，过去每工每日做二百个扣子，用这个机便可做出一万三千个扣子，增加产量六十五倍。辽南新收复区，某纺纱厂在增产运动中，工人李振才改造了精纺机锭子的胎，使产量提高百分之三十。这些事实证明：只有在共产党的正确领导下，劳动者才能真正发挥出自己的创造天才。
