[Taiyue Telegram] Under the vigorous support of our democratic government, the Yuncheng Salt Pond has seen increased manufacturers, higher production, and wider sales after more than five months of effort. Since work began on the county's salt ponds on February 17th, as of August 10th, the number of manufacturers starting sun-drying operations has reached 37, the number of workers has increased to over 3,200, and salt production has reached 1,625 ming (40,000 jin per ming), totaling 65 million jin, exceeding any year during the Japanese puppet and Chiang-Yan occupation period in the last ten years (at that time, the highest annual salt production was no more than 1,200 ming, and the maximum number of factories and merchants was no more than 30). After the liberation of Yuncheng this spring, the Civil Salt Administration of our democratic government devoted all its efforts to restoring the salt ponds. At that time, there were many difficulties: First, the salt ponds suffered serious damage during the war. The Chiang-Yan bandits built fortifications in places such as the Chishen Temple in Dongjinmen Pond, and most of the nearby houses were demolished. For example, Bian Hexing originally had 116 rooms, of which 73 were destroyed. All factory doors and windows in the entire pond were completely destroyed, and most of the tools and livestock were lost. Some even lacked pots and bowls. Manufacturers lacked capital, making it difficult to recover. Second, under the deceptive propaganda of the Chiang-Yan bandits, manufacturers lacked understanding of our Party's policies, resulting in the dispersal of workers and the escape of shopkeepers. At the start of work, there were only 516 workers in the entire factory. In the past five months (February to July), thanks to the implementation of the correct policy of people's production, people's transportation, and people's sales, and with government loans of more than 800 million yuan for support, the abolition of all the exorbitant taxes and levies under the Chiang-Yan rule, the production enthusiasm of salt merchants has increased, production has gradually increased, and sales have become smoother. In order to benefit merchants and the people, and to benefit both labor and capital, the democratic government implemented on-site tax collection methods, eliminating many troubles, and abolished unreasonable wage policies such as accumulated wage arrears and using labor to support factories, eradicated beating and scolding, and guaranteed the lives of workers. The entire factory opened three clinics and one workers' school, so the number of workers increased rapidly, reaching more than 3,200 by the beginning of July.

　　实行民产民运民销政策后
    运城盐池厂商大增
  　半年产盐六千万斤
    【太岳电】运城盐池在我民主政府大力扶植下，经五个多月努力，厂商增加，产量提高，销路日广。该县盐池从二月十七日开工以来，截至八月十日，开晒厂商已达卅七家，职工增至三千二百余人，产盐达一千六百廿五铭（每铭四万斤），合六千五百万斤，超过十年来日伪蒋阎侵占时期内的任何一年（那时每年产盐最高额不过一千二百余铭，工厂商最多时不过卅家）。今春运城解放后，我民主政府民盐管理局即全力恢复盐池。当时困难重重：一来是盐池在战争中受到严重损失，蒋阎匪在东禁门池神庙等地构筑工事，附近房屋大部拆毁。如卞合兴原有房一百一十六间，即破坏了七十三间。全池各厂门窗全部破坏，工具牲口也大部失掉，有的甚至连锅碗也没有了。厂商缺乏资本，很难恢复。二来是在蒋阎匪的欺骗宣传下，厂商对我党政策缺乏了解，以致职工失散，掌柜逃亡。在开工时全厂仅有职工五百一十六人，五个月来（二月至七月）由于实行了民产民运民销的正确方针，政府又贷款八万万多元扶植，废除了蒋阎统治时的一切苛捐杂税，盐商生产情绪提高，产量渐增，销路渐畅。民主政府为了便商利民，劳资两利，实行就场征税办法，免除了许多麻烦，又废除了不合理的积压工资、以工养厂的工资政策，根绝打骂现象，保障了职工生活。全厂开办了三个医疗所，一个职工学校，因此职工迅速增加，在七月初已达三千二百余人。
