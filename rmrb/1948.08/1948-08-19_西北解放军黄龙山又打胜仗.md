　　Northwest PLA Achieves Another Victory at Huanglong Mountain
    (For Mass Blackboards and Rooftop Broadcasts)
    Our Northwest Army has won another great victory on the southern front of Huanglong Mountain in Shaanxi, wiping out the majority of Hu bandit's 36th Division, totaling more than 9,000 people. We killed a enemy deputy division commander, wounded a brigade commander, and captured a chief of staff alive. Our Northwest Army took advantage of the victory to pursue south, and successively recovered the three county towns of Heyang, Chengcheng, and Gaoyi. The 36th Division was one of Hu Zongnan's three main forces. It was annihilated by our army in Mizhi last year. Afterwards, Hu bandit pieced it together with great effort, and now it has been quickly annihilated by our army again. This time, Hu bandit originally sent four divisions, attempting to invade our Northwest Liberated Area, but after suffering this great defeat, the Hu bandit troops of all routes were terrified and ran away with their tails between their legs!

　　西北解放军黄龙山又打胜仗
    （供大众黑板和屋顶广播用）
    西北我军在陕西黄龙山南线，又打了个大胜仗，消灭胡匪三十六师的大部共九千多人，打死敌人一个副师长，打伤一个旅长，活捉一个参谋长。我西北大军乘胜南追，连续收复了＠阳、澄城、＠邑三座县城。三十六师是胡宗南三大主力的一个，去年在米脂曾被我军消灭，以后胡匪东拼西凑把他补充起来，现在又很快被我军消灭了。这次胡匪本来派了四个师，想向我西北解放区冒险进犯，吃了这个大败仗，几路胡匪害怕得不行，都撅起屁股逃回去了！
