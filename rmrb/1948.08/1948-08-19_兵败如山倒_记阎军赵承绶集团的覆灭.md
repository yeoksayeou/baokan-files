　　“Defeat is Like a Mountain Collapsing”
    ——A Record of the Annihilation of Yan Army’s Zhao Chengzhou Group
    Geng Xi
    Whenever the soldiers talked about the annihilation of Zhao Chengzhou, they would slap their thighs with joy and say, “Hey! Defeat was like a mountain collapsing!” On the morning of July 16th, after our army captured Xifan Village, Zhao Chengzhou's defeated remnants, including two divisions, one army headquarters, one general headquarters, and the remnants of the 10th Column, totaling more than 10,000 people, were wiped out by our army in a matter of hours.

    At 2:00 PM that day, five Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes circled in the sky, taking turns diving, bombing, and strafing. Zhao Chengzhou's defeated remnants attempted to break out of the encirclement once, but were beaten back. The second time they tried to break out from the southeast, but Chang Xinping, the battalion commander of our army's main attack battalion, had already led his troops to retake Xiaochang Village from the southwest. The enemy troops that broke out only ran four or five li before being driven back, some were annihilated in the open, and some were forced to the edge of the village; they were driven back and forth by us, looking like a flock of dazed ducks.

    At the village entrance, the enemy crowded together, some trying to squeeze in, some trying to run out. A machine gun burst swept through, the ones in front were shot down, but the ones behind still surged forward. The officers, riding horses, trampled over the corpses as they fled, only to be shot down and fall. A large group of enemies outside the village had not even reached Chewang Village before being pushed back again. They ran from Xiaochang to Xifan, and then from Xifan back to Xiaochang, getting beaten everywhere, with nowhere to go. They ran in a circle, and our heavy machine guns also fired in a circle. This kind of fighting was very novel, and our shooters had rarely used it before. The more intensely the guns fired, the closer the enemies got. After running a circle, they were all annihilated. Our army is lenient and benevolent, shouting slogans while fighting, but they, under the threat and deception of the bandits, were wrongly used as cannon fodder for Yan Xishan!

    On Dingzi Street, the entrance to Zhao Chengzhou's headquarters was packed with people. A burst from our heavy machine gun sent them scrambling into the houses. Our machine guns were already set up on the roof of Zhao Chengzhou's headquarters' backyard, and hand grenades could be thrown into the courtyard. At this time, Zhao Chengzhou sent an adjutant, holding a white handkerchief, squeezing through the crowd, waving it and shouting in fear, "Treat prisoners leniently, treat prisoners leniently!" Battalion Commander Chang Xinping ordered a ceasefire. The adjutant, with two twenty-shot Mausers tucked into his belt, cautiously ran over and whispered in his ear, "Our division commander, army commander, and commander-in-chief are all here. They won't fight anymore and want to surrender to you." When Commander Chang went to their headquarters, Shen Rui, the commander of the Yan Army's 33rd Army, and his staff were all sitting in a bomb shelter. Zhao Chengzhou was curled up in the bomb shelter like a worm. Our soldiers had already captured a large number of weapons and prisoners. A group of enemy soldiers with colored armbands hid in the millrace and were taken in by a combat team of the 3rd Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. They immediately began to complain about the suffering of being forced into the army. When the soldiers of a certain unit were about to search elsewhere and leave them, they were afraid that other units would come and kill them, and they pleaded bitterly, "How can we follow you too!" They grabbed the soldiers' hands and wouldn't let go. The soldiers explained our policy to them clearly, explaining that it would be the same no matter which unit came. One prisoner said, "Wait a minute!" He ran back, chased after them, dug out the bayonets and bullets that had been buried in the ground, and handed them to the soldiers. These people, who had been deceived by war criminals and were afraid, showed such love for the People's Liberation Army once they understood!

    In another doorway, the soldiers shouted, "Everyone take your personal belongings, leave the ammunition and weapons behind!" Immediately, a large pile of guns was stacked up. Here, there was no time to check the guns one by one, but they were counted like piles of firewood, with each pile having hundreds of guns.

    An enemy regimental deputy, holding a Mauser pistol, pointed it at the doorway, his head shrunk in the doorframe, like a rat about to come out of its hole. Liu Xiaosan, a soldier of the 2nd Company, shouted, "Surrender and be spared!" He quickly said, "I'll surrender if you don't shoot!" He surrendered his Mauser pistol, then went in and told his troops to come out and surrender, shouting, "Let's all line up!" Immediately, two or three hundred people lined up neatly.

    Wang Xiaolin's squad of a certain unit's 1st Company used bayonets to pry open a large gate. Liberated soldiers Cui Yongfu and Zhou Xuehai shouted, "We were liberated from Linfen, the People's Liberation Army doesn't shoot those who surrender, and treats prisoners leniently!" As a result, a battalion surrendered its weapons, and the rifles piled up into six large piles. Cui Yongfu ran to the backyard alone. An enemy artillery battalion was there, with four or five hundred people and the yard full of livestock, all frightened and jumping around. He shouted, "Come on! Don't be afraid, the People's Liberation Army treats prisoners leniently. Those who want to work can work, and those who don't want to will be given travel expenses to go home." People stopped running. He shouted again, "Those who want to surrender, put your guns aside and stand on one side!" An entire artillery battalion surrendered. Zhou Xuehai went to another courtyard alone and captured a battalion's worth of guns. Ye Laisuo of the 9th Squad of the 2nd Company also captured four hundred people's guns alone. The enemy's cowardice and our soldiers' bravery were in such stark contrast!

    Just as we were collecting weapons, enemy planes flew low again, and the soldiers picked up their guns and fired at the sky. Some of the captured soldiers were frightened and trembled all over. However, can it be said that they were inherently cowardly? Among the heroic soldiers standing in front of them, weren't many of them liberated from Linfen only recently?

    It was also at this time that Zhao Chengzhou was still hiding in the bomb shelter, afraid of the planes that had once covered his escape. A certain regimental political commissar got angry. This commander-in-chief of Yan Xishan's field army then crawled out of the bomb shelter with a smile on his face. None of the Yan army soldiers who had laid down their weapons failed to glare at him.

　　“兵败如山倒”
     ——记阎军赵承绶集团的覆灭
    耿西
    一谈到赵承绶被歼的情形，战士们都高兴的把大腿一拍说：“嗨！兵败如山倒呀！”七月十六号上午，我军攻占西范村以后，赵承绶的残兵败将还有两个师，一个军部，一个总部，和十纵队残部共一万多人，几个钟头以后，就被我军一扫而光了。
    当天下午两点钟，蒋匪五架飞机在天空盘旋着，轮番的俯冲轰炸扫射，赵承绶的残兵败将，突了一次围，被打回去。第二次再从东南突出去，我军主攻营营长常心平，已经领着部队从西南再打进小常村了。敌人突出去的部队跑了四五里地，也被赶回来，有的在野外就被歼灭了，有的被逼到了村边；被我们赶过来，赶过去，活象一群打昏了头的鸭子。
    村口上，敌人拥塞起来了，有的往里钻，有的往外跑，机枪一扫，前面的已经打倒了，后面的却仍旧往上拥，当官的骑着马，践踏着尸体飞跑，也被打下来跌倒了。村外一大股敌人，还未突到车辋村，又被顶回来。他们从小常跑到西范，又从西范折回小常，到处挨打，无路可走。他们跑了个圆圈，我们的重机枪也转着打了个圆圈，这种打法新奇的很，我们的射手都很少用过。枪越打的紧，敌人越靠的拢，跑了一圈之后，也就被歼灭光了。我军是宽大仁慈的，一面打，一面喊话，而他们在匪首的威胁欺骗之下，冤枉的当了阎锡山的炮灰！
    丁字街上，赵承绶的门口，塞满了人，我们重机枪一扫，他们便往房子里乱钻，我们的机枪已架到赵承绶总部的后院房顶上了，手榴弹已经可以摔到院子里去了。这时候赵承绶派了个副官，举了条白手巾，钻在人群里，一面摇晃，一面害怕的乱喊：“优待俘虏，优待俘虏啊！”常心平营长下令停止射击，那个副官身上插着两只二十响盒子，小心翼翼的跑过来，爬在他的耳朵边说：“我们师长、军长、总司令都在这里，他们不打了，要向你们投降了。”常营长到他们总部去的时候，阎军三十三军军长沈瑞和他的参谋人员，都坐在避弹坑上，赵承绶象一条虫似的在避弹坑里蜷缩着。我们的战士，这时早已大批的缴枪捉俘虏了。敌人有一群彩号，躲在磨道里，被解放军某部三连的战斗小组收容了，他们立刻向我方诉起被抓来当兵的苦来。当某部战士们要到别处搜索，离开他们的时候，他们害怕别的单位来了会杀害他们，苦苦的哀求道：“我们怎么也跟着你们呀！”拉着战士们的手不放，战士们给他们解释清楚了我们的政策，说明哪个单位来了都一样。一个俘虏说：“慢点，等一等！”他飞跑回去，又追上来，把已经埋到土里的刺刀和子弹刨出送到战士们的手里。他们这一群被战争罪犯欺骗怕了的人，稍一明白之后，对于人民解放军是这样热爱啊！
    在另外一个门里，战士们一喊：“私人的东西各人拿走，弹药武器留下来！”马上一大堆枪便堆起来了。这里枪已经来不及一条条的细查，而是象堆柴火一样，一堆堆的数了，每堆总有百十支。
    敌人的一个团副，拿了支盒子枪，端在门口，把脑袋缩在门缝里，象一支将要出洞的耗子。二连战士刘小三看见了，叫了一声：“缴枪不杀”；他连忙说：“不打就缴枪！”他缴了盒子枪，接着进去把他的部队都叫出来缴了械，喊了一声：“我们都站起队来！”马上二三百人都排整齐了。
    某部一连王小林班的战士，用刺刀拨开了一座大门，解放战士崔永福、周学海就喊：“我们是临汾解放过来的，解放军就是缴枪不打，优待俘虏！”于是一个营缴了枪，步枪堆了六大堆。崔永福一个人跑到后院里，敌人一个炮兵营在那里，人有四五百，牲口一满院，吓的乱蹦乱跳。他喊一声：“来！不要怕，解放军优待俘虏，愿意干的干，不愿意干的发路费回家”。人们都停止逃跑了。他再喊一句：“愿意缴枪的把枪放在一边，人站在一边！”一个整炮兵营缴械了。周学海一个人又到别的院子里，缴了一个营的枪。二连九班的叶来锁一个人也缴了四百人的枪。敌人的怯懦和我军战士的勇敢对比起来，是何等的悬殊啊！
    正当我们收缴枪支的时候，敌人的飞机又低飞过来了，战士们拿起枪来对空射击。有些俘虏士兵吓慌了，全身打哆嗦。然而，这能够说他们是生性怯懦吗？站在他们面前的英勇战士之中，不是有许多还是临汾才解放过来的吗？
    也正是这个时候，赵承绶还躲在避弹坑里不出来，害怕曾经掩护过他突围的飞机。某团政委发脾气了。这位阎锡山的野战军总司令，于是便从避弹坑里陪着笑脸爬出来了。阎军放下武器的士兵没有一个不对他怒目而视。
