    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th: The Political Department of the Shandong Corps of the East China People's Liberation Army recently issued a circular to its subordinates, stating that after liberated soldiers enlist, local governments should be immediately notified so that their families can immediately enjoy the treatment of military dependents. The circular stipulates: All units should investigate and register existing liberated soldiers in the unit according to their name, age, place of origin, process of liberation, and specific performance. For those whose families are within the liberated areas, political organs above the regimental level should notify the relevant local governments and their families so that they can quickly enjoy preferential treatment; for those whose families are outside the liberated areas, they should also be registered, and after the area is liberated and a democratic government is established, the local democratic government should be notified to provide the same preferential treatment. All units should also educate the liberated soldiers on this regulation and its implementation. In addition, the circular also stipulates that this work should be established as a regular political work system in the future.
