Criticism and Suggestions

　　The Roads Should Be Repaired
    At this time of vigorous construction, repairing roads is essential. The section of the road from Chahar South to Hebei West, at Chajianling, has long been in disrepair. Because it is a major thoroughfare with a lot of traffic, driving is very difficult and dangerous. To my knowledge, there have been two recent accidents. I am just offering this suggestion, hoping that the relevant departments will consider it.

　　公路应该修好
    值兹大力建设时期，修复公路在所必需。察南到冀西公路上，插箭岭那一段，早已失修。因是通衢大路，来往车辆甚多，行车甚为艰难危险。据我所知，发生失事情形最近已有两起。仅提出意见，希有关方面考虑。
