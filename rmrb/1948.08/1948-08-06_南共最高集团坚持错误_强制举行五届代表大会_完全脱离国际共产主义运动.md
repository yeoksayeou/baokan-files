Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 3rd: The supreme clique of the Yugoslav Communist Party, which has deviated from Marxism-Leninism, forcibly held a Fifth National Congress in Belgrade from July 21st to 29th that could not represent the Yugoslav Communist Party. According to a report by the TASS correspondent for Pravda: "The congress was conducted in an atmosphere of complete detachment from the international communist movement. Although the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party sent out many invitations, not a single Communist Party in the world sent a representative to attend." A Trotskyite-spy group masquerading as the "Swiss Communist Party" sent a representative, but it has absolutely no connection with the true communist party of Switzerland, the Swiss Labor Party. The Pravda reporter also stated: "The preparation for the congress and the congress itself were conducted under conditions of barbaric terror exercised by the Yugoslav Communist supreme clique against party members who expressed even the slightest disagreement with the policies of Tito and Ranković." During the preparation period, many delegates who had already been elected to attend the congress were immediately removed from all positions and arrested because they did not express their willingness to blindly vote in favor of the anti-Soviet and anti-socialist program of the Yugoslav Communist supreme clique. There were particularly large numbers of arrests in Macedonia and Serbia in southern Yugoslavia. The congress venue was surrounded by troops and equipped with anti-aircraft guns, and aircraft were ready to take off at any moment. When reporting on this matter, the Pravda reporter asked: "When Tito and Ranković assert that the party masses unanimously obey the supreme clique of the Yugoslav Communist Central Committee, who are these military and police deployments intended to deal with?" At the congress, Tito's lengthy report on the opening day was filled with blatant threats against those Yugoslav Communist Party members who were loyal to the principles of internationalism and Marxism-Leninism. He declared: "We will mercilessly deal with all those who deviate from the line of our party." Tito, Ranković, Kardelj, and Djilas delivered lengthy speeches at the congress, persisting in their errors and boasting of "historical merits." Ranković, who is both the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Minister of Organization of the Yugoslav Communist Party, on the one hand, used police methods to handle party affairs and persecuted many outstanding party members; on the other hand, when reporting on the party's organizational work to the congress, he feigned allegiance to the Marxist principles of the party program and constitution. As the Pravda reporter said: "The current leaders of Yugoslavia do not rely on the persuasiveness of their debates and speeches, but on force and retaliation. The widespread terrorism they practice has a specific purpose, which is to threaten the party masses and force the congress delegates to blindly vote in favor of everything that the dictatorial supreme clique of the Yugoslav Communist Party orders them to do," "to maintain their leadership in the party and adhere to an anti-people stance." "Yugoslav workers, watching the proceedings of the congress and witnessing the arrest of large numbers of Communist Party members, say sadly: Now it is not the fascists who collaborated with the aggressors who are being imprisoned, but the Communists who fought against them." Therefore, the congress could only arrive at the results that the Tito clique had already arranged for it: the reports of Tito, Ranković, and Djilas, the actions and policies of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and the draft declaration of the appointed committee refuting the Cominform's decision were all "unanimously adopted"; at the last meeting on the 28th, the "election" resulted in Tito remaining as General Secretary, and Kardelj, Djilas, and Ranković all remained as Secretaries. This set of methods by the Tito clique to maintain its dictatorial rule through terrorism proves the Pravda reporter's assertion during the congress, namely: "The Yugoslav Communist Party has embarked on the path of fascist methods, the same methods that the French Doriot (note: a traitor to the French Communist Party) attempted to use against the French Communist Party, and Mussolini used against the Italian Communist Party, both of whom quickly degenerated into fascists. This is a useful historical lesson, and the bureaucratic supreme clique of the Yugoslav Communist Party has reached its final limit."

### 南共最高集团坚持错误  强制举行五届代表大会  完全脱离国际共产主义运动

    南共最高集团坚持错误
    强制举行五届代表大会
    完全脱离国际共产主义运动
    【新华社陕北三日电】自七月二十一日至二十九日，已背离了马列主义的南斯拉夫共产党的最高集团在贝尔格莱德强制举行了不能代表南斯拉夫共产党的第五届全国代表大会。据塔斯社广播真理报特派记者的报导：“大会是在完全脱离国际共产主义运动的空气中进行的。虽然南共中委会发了很多请柬，但全世界却没有一国共产党派代表出席。”有一个挂着“瑞士共产党”招牌的托洛斯基——特务集团派代表参加，但它与瑞士的真正共产主义者的党——瑞士劳动党完全无关。真理报记者并称：“大会的准备与大会本身是在南共最高集团对于向铁托与兰科维奇政策稍表异议的党员行使野蛮恐怖手段的情况下进行的。”在准备期间，许多已当选出席大会的代表，由于他们没有表示愿意盲目地投票赞成南共最高集团的反苏反社会主义纲领，就立即被革去一切职务而被逮捕。在南国的马其顿及塞尔维亚被捕的人特别多。大会会场四周密布军队，并设有高射炮，飞机准备随时出动。真理报记者于报导此事时发问：“当铁托与兰科维奇断言党内群众一致服从南共中央最高集团时，这些军警布置是为了对付谁的？”在大会上，铁托在开幕日所作的冗长报告中，就充满着对那些忠于国际主义原则与马列主义的南共党员之露骨的威胁。他宣称：“我们将无情地对付一切离开我党路线的人”。铁托、兰科维奇、卡德尔与德热拉斯辈在大会上发表了长篇演说，坚持错误，高谈“历史功绩”。身兼政府内政部长与南共组织部长的兰科维奇，一方面以警察办法处理党内事务，对许多优秀党员施行迫害；一方面在向大会报告党的组织工作时，装模作样地发誓忠于党纲与党章的马克思主义原则。如真理报记者所说：“南斯拉夫现在的领袖们并不是凭借他们辩论和演讲的说服力，而是凭借武力和报复。他们所广泛施行的恐怖主义办法有一个特定的目的，就是威胁党内群众，强迫大会代表盲从地投票赞成南共独裁的最高集团所命令他们的一切”，“维持他们在党内的领导和坚持反人民的立场”。“注视代表大会进行的情形，和目睹大批共产党员被捕的南斯拉夫工人伤心地说：现在将受监禁的不是曾和侵略者合作的法西斯分子，而是曾对他们作战的共产党人”。因此，代表大会只能得出铁托集团所早已为它安排下的结果：铁托、兰科维奇与德热拉斯的报告、南共中央的行动和政策、任命委员会草拟驳复情报局决定的宣言都被“一致通过”了；二十八日末次会议“选举”结果，铁托仍任总书记，卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇均任书记。铁托集团这一套以恐怖主义维持其独裁统治的手段，证明了真理报记者在大会进行时的论断，即：“南共已走上法西斯方法的道路，法国多利欧（按系法共叛徒）当时之企图反对法共，以及墨索里尼之反对意共都是用的这种方法，两者都很快地沦为法西斯主义者，这是有益的历史教训，南共官僚主义的最高集团已到了最后的限度。”
