    Inquiry and Reply

　　It is wrong to exclude intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds.
    Editor:
    I have seen many documents in the newspaper about Comrade Ren Bishi's policies on intellectuals in the land reform and other documents on mobilizing personnel who were previously squeezed out to resume work, but some places still have not implemented them. What I have seen is that the training class in my county (Ci County) only absorbed children from worker and peasant backgrounds, and did not absorb those from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds.

    This situation is understandable for those with backward thinking (but in reality, we should also find ways to educate them and not abandon them, because it is not easy to cultivate these people; if they are truly stubborn and unrepentant, then we can only ignore them). But there are still a large number of intellectuals with progressive ideas who want to be good long-term workers for the people and contribute to the revolution, but they cannot come out to participate in work because: (1) The government does not advocate it. (2) There are no acquaintances to introduce them in government agencies and schools, and even if there are, no one dares to introduce them (for fear of being accused of harboring them). Village cadres are also unwilling to call them out, because one more person at home means one more person to bear corvee labor. I hope that the leading organs in various places will pay attention to solving this problem.

    In addition, Li Chong, a middle peasant from Dongcaojiazhuang, Third District of Ci County, who was wrongly struggled against (and died of illness the year before last), has not only not been compensated to this day, but his nephew is still doing unpaid labor. Please answer whether this is appropriate.  Li Zihe

    ◇Answer: Uniting and striving for intellectuals from all classes to serve the new democratic state is a consistent policy of our party. Even those from landlord and rich peasant families should also be strived for and educated, and should not be excluded and unused, because regardless of their family background, they are intellectual laborers with knowledge and expertise. Striving for their participation in work is of positive significance to the recovery and construction of the liberated areas. Conversely, abandoning these people and not using them is harmful to the people's construction cause. We are not familiar with the situation of the training class in Ci County, but if it only absorbs children from worker and peasant backgrounds and excludes intellectuals from landlord, rich peasant, and other family backgrounds, it is wrong. We hope that the Ci County Party Committee will check and correct this. At the same time, intellectuals who were squeezed out in the past based solely on their class background, except for those who have definite evidence of being counter-revolutionaries or local despots, should generally have their work restored. It is also wrong to leave this problem unattended. All responsible organs should pay attention to solving it in a timely manner.

    It is a wrong behavior that violates the policy to not compensate the wrongly struggled middle peasants in Caojiazhuang, Third District of Ci County, and to still force them to do unpaid labor. We hope that the Ci County Party Committee will quickly check and correct this.

　　What is a revolutionary staff member?
    Editor:
    The People's Daily on the 3rd of this month carried the "Measures for Substitute Farming for Families of Revolutionary Staff Members" stipulated by the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Administrative Committee of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. Which departments do the staff members mentioned as "revolutionary staff members" refer to? I hope you can answer.
  　Lin Fang
    ◇Answer: All personnel who work in various public agencies and people's revolutionary organizations in our liberated areas and rely on this work to maintain their livelihood, regardless of what work they do, are called revolutionary staff members. People from worker, peasant, and other laboring classes (including intellectual laborers) can obtain the status of revolutionary staff member from the moment they start working. People from exploiting classes or families of exploiting classes can obtain the status of revolutionary staff member after working for two full years, but their own or their family's background cannot be changed as a result. All revolutionary staff members who are deprived of all revolutionary work will have their status as revolutionary staff member revoked at the same time. Those who do not separate from their family's economic life but engage in revolutionary work have the same class background as their family. The direct relatives of revolutionary staff members, namely father, mother, wife, son, daughter, and younger siblings under the age of sixteen, are treated as family members of revolutionary staff members, regardless of their class background, during the time that the revolutionary staff member is working.

　　Special agents who shoot from the dark should be suppressed!
    Editor:
    Secret shootings have been occurring continuously in the area east and south of Shizhuang. According to the confessions of special agents arrested locally, they are planned by counter-revolutionaries. Please ask all stationed agencies and governments to closely combine with the masses to destroy this conspiracy of the counter-revolutionaries.
    ◇Answer: Counter-revolutionaries who shoot from the dark are committing criminal acts that disrupt the social order of the liberated areas. Public security organs in various places should pay serious attention to this, track down and arrest them. Those who are found to have definite evidence should be resolutely suppressed according to law. At the same time, the masses should be mobilized to assist the government in preventing traitors. As long as the masses are mobilized, a few special agents and bandits will not be able to run rampant.

专栏：询问与答复

    询问与答复
　　排斥地富出身的知识分子是不对的
    编辑同志：
    我在报上见到任弼时同志在土改中几个问题关于知识分子的政策及其他动员过去挤回去的人员恢复工作等文件很多，但有些地方至今仍未执行。我所看到的，在这次我县（磁县）教训班所吸收的不过只是些工农出身的子弟，而没有吸收地富出身的参加。
    象这种情形对那些思想落后的还情有可原（实际上也应设法教育他们，不该丢弃他们，因培养这批人不易，如他真顽固不化，那也只有置之不理了）。但还很有一大批思想进步的知识分子，想在社会上为人民当一个好长工，为革命出一部分力量，也不能出来参加工作，因为：（一）政府不提倡。（二）机关学校里没熟人介绍，即有也不敢介绍（因怕别人说包庇）了。村上干部也不乐意叫出外，因在家一人多一人担负支差的原故。希望各地领导机关注意解决这个问题。
    另磁县三区东曹家庄错斗了的中农李重（前年已病死），至今不但不补偿，他侄儿至今仍在无偿劳动。请答这样是否应该。     李子和
    ◇答：团结争取各阶层出身的知识分子为新民主主义的国家服务，是我党一贯方针，即使是地富家庭出身的，也同样应争取教育，而不应一律排挤不用，因为不论其家庭成份如何，其本人是有知识和专门技能的脑力劳动者，争取他们参加工作，对于解放区的恢复与建设是有积极作用的。反之，对这些人摈弃不用，对人民的建设事业是有害的。磁县教训班的情况我们不了解，但如果只吸收工农子弟，排斥地富及其他家庭出身的知识分子是不对的。希望磁县县委检查纠正。同时，过去各地单纯根据成份而挤出去的知识分子，除了那确有证据的反革命分子或恶霸分子外，一般的都应设法恢复他们的工作。这个问题放着不管，也是不对的，各负责机关应注意及时解决。
    磁县三区曹家庄这样不补偿错斗中农，且仍强迫做无偿劳动，是违犯政策的错误行为，希望磁县县委赶快检查纠正。

　　什么是革命职员？
    编辑同志：
    本月三日人民日报载晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会规定：“革命职员家属代耕办法”所说革命职员，系指那些部门工作之职员？望能答复。
  　林舫
    ◇答：凡在我们解放区各公家机关和人民革命团体中做工作，并靠这种工作维持生活的全体人员，不管他担任什么工作，都叫做革命职员。工人农民和其他劳动者（包括脑力劳动者）出身的人，从他开始担任工作起，即可取得革命职员成份。剥削者出身或剥削者家庭出身的人，担任工作满二年以后，即可取得革命职员成份，但他本人出身或家庭出身不能因此改变。凡革命职员被撤消一切革命工作者，其革命职员成份，即同时取消。凡不脱离家庭经济生活而担任革命工作者，其成份与其家庭相同。革命职员的直系家属，即父、母、妻、子、女及十六岁以下的弟妹，在革命职员担任工作的时间内，无论他是什么成份，都按革命职员家属待遇。

　　特务打黑枪应予镇压！
    编者同志：
    石庄以东以南地区不断发生打黑枪。据当地获案之特务供，是反革命分子有计划制造的，请各驻地机关、政府密切结合群众摧毁反革命分子这一阴谋。
    ◇答：反革命分子打黑枪，属于破坏解放区社会秩序的犯罪行为，各地治安机关应严重注意，跟踪缉捕，经查获确有证据的，应依法坚决镇压，同时应发动群众协助政府防奸，只要群众发动起来，少数特务匪徒就无法逞凶。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
