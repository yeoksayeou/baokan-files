　　Newspapers Should Increase Coverage of Military Life
　　To the Editors of the People's Daily:

　　We have a suggestion for you:

　　We feel that there are too few magazines in the North China Liberated Area. The war is not reflected much in the newspapers. Many comrades want to write about military life, but they have no place to publish. The newspapers also do not have supplements. Can this problem be solved? Please forward this suggestion to the responsible department. We would be very grateful if you could reply.

　　Comrades Yang Jue and Yang Jue:

　　Your suggestion is very good. Currently, due to space limitations, the People's Daily indeed does not reflect the war and military life sufficiently. This newspaper will make its best efforts to overcome difficulties, expand its size, and add a fourth page. We welcome you to write and send more articles reflecting the war and military life, and to regularly offer suggestions for improving the newspaper.

　　——Editor

### 报纸应增加篇幅多反映部队生活

　　报纸应增加篇幅多反映部队生活
    人民日报编辑同志：
    我们有个意见提给你们：
    我们感到华北解放区杂志太少。战争的反映在报纸上的就不多，有好多同志想写部队生活的稿子，苦于无处发表，报纸又无副刊，这个问题是否可以解决，请将此意见转达负责部门为荷。如能赐复更为企望之至。　
　　杨觉杨觉同志：
    你的意见很好，目前人民日报因篇幅关系，对于战争及部队生活确是反映得很不够的，本报当以最大努力，克服困难，扩大篇幅，增出四版。欢迎你们多多写寄反映战争及部队生活的稿件，并经常对报纸提出改进意见。
    ——编者
