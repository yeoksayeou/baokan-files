    [Taihang Dispatch] As Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in northern Henan face their doomsday and struggle desperately, they are implementing brutal and vicious plundering policies in their occupied areas, forcing the people to either rise up and resist conscription or flee in large numbers to our areas. In the past six months, the levies and requisitions imposed by the Chiang bandits have exceeded twice the actual output of the farmers' land. In Xiaoyan Village, Xinxiang, with only 42 households, over 21,000 catties of military wheat and fodder have been requisitioned, and over 500 laborers have been conscripted in five months. The trees of the Zhou family in Hehe Town have all been cut down by the Chiang bandits. Chu Yuchang, the puppet county magistrate of Wuzhi, made a hypocritical "official announcement exempting" flood-stricken areas from burdens, but Fucun, a severely flooded area, has been levied a total of 262 shi of grain in the form of conscripted laborers and military grain in the past six months. Some people who could not raise the grain in time were charged an additional 47.8 shi of interest grain. Since the wheat harvest, which was just over a month ago, every mu of land in the Chiang-occupied area of the county has already been levied 88 to 110 catties of wheat. The masses are complaining bitterly and hate the Chiang bandits to the bone. Li, the division commander of Chiang's 40th Division, ran to Jiaozuo on July 3 to convene a meeting of the puppet county magistrates of six counties: Xiuwu, Xinxiang, Xin, Huojia, Wuzhi, and Bo'ai, to discuss large-scale grain robbery and conscription. The puppet county magistrate of Wuzhi, who was defeated in our wheat protection struggle, was reprimanded at the meeting and issued a "hand order" to the puppet township and bao-jia heads on July 7, raving, "This county has been severely punished by higher authorities for failing to submit the assigned grain quotas on time according to orders. Township and bao-jia heads are allowed to take any means necessary to complete the task in regards to conscription methods. If there are further delays, the respective township and bao-jia heads shall be held responsible under military law." The Chiang bandits' looting and extortion are becoming increasingly frantic, forcing the masses to be unable to live and rise up to resist levies and donations, or painfully leave their homes and flee. In the Chiang-occupied area of Xiuwu, the masses of three villages have organized armed forces to protect their homes and carry out anti-looting struggles. Nearly 200 households of Jiaozuo city residents have fled to our area in recent days. In Xue Village, Xiuwu, 40 households, more than 200 people, were forced to flee by the Chiang bandits' grain conscription in one day. According to the masses who fled from Shangtun and other villages in the Chiang-occupied area of Xiuwu: Since the wheat harvest, the Chiang bandits have levied grain four times. The first time was six dou per two taels of silver, the second time was four dou, the third time was 130 catties, and the fourth time was six dou. It is said that the stubborn enemy has recently come up with a conspiracy to replace grain with military service, attempting to remedy the fatal wound of insufficient troops. In Mudian, the Chiang bandits force the masses to put on military uniforms and stand guard, with one night of guarding being worth three catties of wheat. The Guyang puppet township office, which governs 18 bao, forces the masses to take turns every day to stand guard at a certain blockhouse on the north bank of the Yellow River, with one night being worth two catties of wheat.

    豫北蒋伪残暴搜刮
    群众纷起逃亡抗征
    【太行电】豫北蒋匪面临末日，垂死挣扎，近在其占领区进行残暴狠毒的搜刮政策，逼得人民或起而抗征，或大批逃来我区。半年来，蒋匪勒索派数已超过农民土地实产量的两倍。新乡仅有四十二户人家的小阎庄，五个月就派了军麦和马料共二万一千多斤，出夫五百多个。合河镇周老百姓的树木全被蒋匪砍光。武陟伪县长储玉常曾假猩猩的“明令免除”水灾区负担，但水灾严重的傅村，半年来征派壮丁、军粮等共折粮二百六十二石多，有些人未能及时凑齐，另加利息粮四十七石八斗，麦收以来不过月余，该县蒋占区每亩田已收到麦子八十八斤至一百一十斤，群众叫苦连天，对蒋匪恨之入骨。蒋匪四十师的师长李某某于七月三日跑到焦作召集修武、新乡、县、获嘉、武陟、博爱六县伪县长开会，讨论大肆抢粮抓丁。在我保麦斗争中遭到残败武陟伪县长在会上受了斥责，竟于七月七日向各伪乡镇保甲长发出“手令”，狂吠“本县奉配各项粮案，因为不能遵照命令按时送缴，已经受到了上级的严重处分。各乡镇保甲长对于长征方法准许采取任何手段、只求完成任务，如再贻误，各该乡镇保甲长应负军法责任。”蒋匪抢掠敲诈越来越疯狂，逼得群众不能生活下去，纷纷起而抗征抗捐，有的是忍痛离乡逃亡。修武蒋占区已有三个村的群众组织起保家武装，进行反抢掠斗争。焦作市民近几天逃到我区的达二百余户，修武学庄一天内被蒋匪征粮逼走四十户，二百多人。据修武蒋占区上屯等村逃出群众谈：自麦收到现在，蒋匪已派粮四次。第一次每两银六斗，第二次四斗，第三次一百三十斤，第四次六斗。据称为顽近来想出一种以军役顶缴粮的阴谋手段，妄图补救其兵力不足的致命伤，木店蒋匪强迫群众换上军衣站岗放哨，站一夜顶三斤麦。古阳伪乡公所辖十八个保，每天轮流强迫群众到黄河北岸某炮楼上放哨，一夜顶二斤麦子。
