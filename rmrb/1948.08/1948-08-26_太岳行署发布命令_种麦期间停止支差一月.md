Taiyue Administrative Office Issues Order
　　Stop Labor Conscription for One Month During Wheat Planting
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Taiyue Administrative Office ordered all special district and county governments on August 16 to stop labor conscription for one month during the wheat planting season. The order stated: In the past, due to the lack of labor and livestock, and the heavy burden of war support tasks, coupled with chaotic conscription by lower levels, wheat planting was greatly affected. "This year, in order to ensure timely wheat planting, good plowing, sufficient fertilizer application, it is specifically decided to stop labor conscription for one month during the wheat planting period. During this period, all conscription tasks must be resolutely stopped. Support for war efforts should also take into consideration the varying progress of wheat planting in each county and be appropriately adjusted."

  　种麦期间停止支差一月
    【太岳电】太岳行署于八月十六日命令各专署县府，在种麦期间停止支差一月。命令中称：过去由于劳畜力缺乏，战勤任务繁重，下边又乱派差，影响种麦甚巨，“今年为了种麦、犁好地、上足肥、种应时，特决定种麦期间，停止支差一个月，在此期间，一切差务坚决停止。参战勤务也要尽量照顾到各县的种麦先后，适当调剂”。
