Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st. The Harbin Municipal Commemoration Meeting for the Third Anniversary of "August 15th" sent telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and Soviet Marshal Stalin. The telegram to Chairman Mao stated: "Due to your wise leadership and the efforts of all the military and civilians in the liberated areas, the Kuomintang bandit troops have been continuously defeated in the Northeast, and 97 percent of the Northeast's territory has been liberated. Throughout the country, our People's Liberation Army has shifted from defense to offense and is approaching national victory. The representatives of the entire city of Harbin, in addition to expressing our highest respect to you—the leader of the Chinese people—resolutely declare: We have endured fourteen years of national subjugation and will never allow American imperialism to invade the Northeast. We resolutely oppose American imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggression and oppose all the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in selling out the nation. We pledge to work even harder under your call for the correct principles of 'developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital,' to support the war effort, liberate the entire Northeast as soon as possible, and build a free, democratic, prosperous, and strong New Democratic New China."

The telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stated: "As we drink water, we remember the source. We extend our highest respect and heartfelt condolences to you and all the commanders and fighters under your command who persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance and the two-year War of Liberation for your great achievements! We pledge to strengthen production and rear-area construction with firm confidence and redoubled efforts to fully support the front lines and accelerate the complete victory of the People's Liberation War."

The telegram to Marshal Stalin and the Red Army commanders, fighters, and all the people stated: "The people of Harbin and the entire Northeast will never forget your great achievements and your unparalleled heroism and self-sacrificing spirit. As American imperialism attempts to invade the world, help the Kuomintang reactionaries continue the civil war, and support the revival of Japanese aggression, threatening the Northeast and our people once again, we more clearly recognize that only the Soviet Union is the bulwark of world democracy and peace and the most loyal friend of our people. Today, the people of Harbin express their heartfelt gratitude to the great Soviet Union and hope that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will be further consolidated and enhanced!"
