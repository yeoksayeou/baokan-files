Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. TASS reports: The Soviet Union is facing its second bumper harvest since the war. Large-scale harvesting is rapidly unfolding from south to north. Many regions began harvesting half a month to a month earlier than last year. By the first half of July, one-fifth of the collective farms in the European part of the Soviet Union had completed harvesting, with 6.3 million hectares more grain stored than in the same period last year. The harvesting speed is increasing daily, with 500,000 hectares of newly harvested grain being stored every day. The harvest volume in major grain-producing areas such as Ukraine, Moldova, Crimea, and the North Caucasus even greatly exceeds that of last year. Furthermore, the national cultivated area this year exceeds last year by 11 million hectares. Only the Volga River region is experiencing drought. A large number of new automatic combine harvesters, reapers, threshers, and various agricultural machines have been put into the harvesting campaign. The water and land transportation systems are working at full capacity to transport grain, and trucks loaded with grain are racing day and night to government granaries on the highways. Grain ships are frequently traveling on the Dnieper and Volga Rivers. The grain transported on the Dnieper River in the first 18 days of July was twice as much as in the same period last year. Both collective farmers and transportation workers are striving to complete the grain delivery plan ahead of schedule.

    苏联正进行大丰收
    主要产粮区收获量大大超过去年
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社讯：苏联正面临战后第二次大丰收。大规模的收割正迅速自南迤北全面展开中。许多地区今年收获较去年提早半个月到一个月，截止七月上半月止，苏联欧洲部分集体农场已有五分之一收割完毕，入仓粮食较去年同时多六百三十万公顷。收割速度日益增大，现在每天有五十万公顷新收粮食入仓。主要产粮区乌克兰、莫达维亚、克里米亚、北高加索收获量甚至大大超过去年。而全国耕种面积今年且超过去年一千一百万公顷。仅伏尔加河沿岸地区有旱象。大批新式的自动联合收割机、刈割机、打谷机与各种农业机器被投入收获运动中。水陆运输系统全力进行运输粮食的工作，公路上满载粮食的卡车日夜不停的向政府粮库奔驰。德聂伯河与伏尔加河上运粮船来往频繁，德聂伯河七月头十八天所运的粮食就比去年同期多两倍。不论集体农民与运输工人都以提前完成缴粮计划为努力的目标。
