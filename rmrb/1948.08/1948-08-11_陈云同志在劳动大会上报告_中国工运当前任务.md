Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. Comrade Chen Yun, a prominent leader of the Chinese workers' movement, reported on the current tasks of the Chinese workers' movement on the third and fourth days of the Sixth National Labor Congress. Due to the important significance of this report for the future of the labor movement, all representatives listened attentively and took notes throughout the long report, and the venue was exceptionally quiet. The report is divided into four parts. First, the general task. Comrade Chen Yun pointed out that the general task of the Chinese working class at present is to completely overthrow the rule of imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in China, and to establish a new democratic People's Republic of China. To this end, Comrade Chen Yun called on the working class across the country to be vigilant and expose all the hypocritical peace conspiracies played by the Kuomintang reactionary group as it approaches defeat, and to closely unite itself, unite the peasants, independent laborers, freelancers, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, and enlightened gentry to establish a national united front against American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, so as to convene a revolutionary political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries at an appropriate time to discuss and realize the convening of a people's representative assembly to organize a people's democratic republic with the joint dictatorship of various democratic classes.
    
    In the KMT-Controlled Areas:

    Master the Tactics of Struggle and Unity, Prepare to Welcome the People's Liberation Army

    Next, Comrade Chen Yun elaborated on the second part of the report, pointing out that the current main tasks of the labor movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are as follows: (1) Gather strength, expand the ranks, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army. (2) Master the tactics of struggle and unity, and adopt different attitudes towards national capitalists and bureaucratic capitalists: unite with national capitalists to jointly oppose imperialism and bureaucratic capital. (3) Dispatch skilled technicians to the Liberated Areas to participate in the construction of new-style industry and commerce, and at the same time protect all public and private enterprises and their factories, machines, and materials so that they are not destroyed. (4) Pay attention to protecting their own organizations and leaders, strengthen internal unity among workers, and strictly guard against the enemy's provocations.
    
    The third part of the report concerns the tasks of the labor movement in the Liberated Areas. Comrade Chen Yun first pointed out that the labor movement in the Liberated Areas is being carried out under a completely new condition: the working class has been liberated and has become the leading class of the state power. In state-owned, public, and cooperative enterprises, there is no contradiction between labor and capital, and the workers have become the masters of the enterprise; although labor-capital relations still exist in private enterprises, the leading position of the workers in politics and government guarantees that the workers will not be oppressed and excessively exploited. Therefore, the labor movement in the Liberated Areas should be carried out under completely new guidelines and policies.
    
    In the Liberated Areas:

    Study Hard and Improve Yourself, Actively Promote Industrial Construction

    Under these circumstances, Comrade Chen Yun pointed out that the task of the workers in the Liberated Areas is first to raise their awareness, study hard, and consciously and actively participate in all aspects of the new democratic construction, especially the development of industrial production, in order to ensure the victory of the revolutionary war and meet the needs of the people. At this point, Comrade Chen Yun elaborated more specifically on a series of problems that must be solved in order to develop industry. The first is the planned nature of industry. In the future, all state-owned and public enterprises must first conduct investigations and studies and overall planning, and carry out production under unified leadership and unified planning. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the operation and management of state-owned and public enterprises, mainly by implementing the principle of enterprise management and implementing democratic management. The current problem of the lack of industrial technical cadres should be addressed by improving the work efficiency of current cadres on the one hand, and by opening industrial specialized schools and worker schools training courses to cultivate new talents on the other hand. Industrial talents and technicians who voluntarily come to serve in the Liberated Areas should be welcomed and united well. Regarding the issue of working hours, in the current environment of unprecedented war, factory workers in the Liberated Areas should generally implement an eight- to ten-hour working system. Except for urgent war needs, the daily working hours, including overtime, should not exceed twelve hours.
    
    Regarding the regulations on wages, Comrade Chen Yun pointed out a principle, namely, to oppose egalitarianism and advocate the implementation of a cross-progressive wage system. The criteria for assessing wages are mainly based on position, ability, technical proficiency, and work attitude, and should not be based on other conditions. Female workers, young workers, and child laborers should receive equal pay for equal work. The apprenticeship period should not exceed three years, and the relationship between master and apprentice should strictly adhere to the principle of respecting the teacher and loving the apprentice. As for workers' labor protection and welfare undertakings, factories and trade unions must handle them well, and the funds can be raised by the factories paying a certain percentage of the total wages and the workers paying a certain percentage of their wages.
    
    Regarding the labor emulation and labor hero movement in state-owned and public enterprises, Comrade Chen Yun believes that this movement has played a positive role in developing production in the past, and should continue to be promoted in the future, but the tendencies of formalism and individual championshipism must be opposed. As for trade union work, Comrade Chen Yun pointed out that the task of trade union work in the Liberated Areas is to unite all workers, actively work, abide by discipline, and protect the daily interests of workers, and educate workers under the general policy of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. Enable workers to exert their management capabilities in state-owned, public, and cooperative enterprises; realize the supervisory role in private enterprises. In individual labor, promote technological improvement and production cooperation. The recruitment of trade union members must be based on the principle of voluntariness, and strive to attract all workers to join the trade union. The trade union must have practical and regular work that can truly solve the needs of the masses, and at the same time, it must thoroughly rectify the bureaucratic and formalistic style in the current trade union work, so that the trade union truly becomes an organization of its own workers.
    
    Finally, in the fourth part of the report, Comrade Chen Yun talked about the issue of restoring the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He said that in order to ensure the implementation of the resolutions of the Congress, it is necessary to establish a unified national organization of the Chinese working class - to restore the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in order to guide the actions of the masses of workers in various places. This Congress should instruct the new executive committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to continue the revolutionary tradition of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions during the First Great Revolution, and quickly organize staff and workers across the country, and unite with all democratic parties, people's organizations, and ethnic minorities across the country, to fight to the end to quickly overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, in China, and to establish a unified new democratic People's Republic of China. At this point, Comrade Chen Yun led the audience to shout: Workers of all China, unite and advance under the banner of Chairman Mao!

　　陈云同志在劳动大会上报告
  　中国工运当前任务
    【新华社东北九日电】第六次全国劳动大会第三、第四两日，中国职工运动著名领袖陈云同志报告了关于中国职工运动的当前任务。由于这一报告对于今后职工运动的重要意义，在长时间的报告过程中，全场代表均始终聚精会神，低头记录，会场异常静谧。该报告共分四大部分。首先是总的任务，陈云同志指出当前中国工人阶级的总任务，乃是彻底推翻帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派在中国的统治，建立新民主主义的中华人民民主共和国。为此，陈云同志号召全国工人阶级必须及时警惕、和揭破国民党反动集团在接近失败时所玩弄的一切虚伪的和平阴谋，并紧密的团结自己、团结农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、自由资产阶级及开明士绅，建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府的民族统一战线，以便在适当时机召开没有反动派参加的革命的政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，组织各民主阶级联合专政的人民民主共和国。
    在蒋管区：
    掌握斗争团结的策略　准备迎接人民解放军
    接着陈云同志阐述了报告的第二部分，指出国民党统治区职工运动当前的主要任务有如下四条：（一）聚集力量，扩大队伍，准备迎接人民解放军。（二）掌握斗争和团结的策略，对待民族资本家与官僚资本家应取不同的态度：联合民族资本家，共同反对帝国主义与官僚资本。（三）派遣熟练的技术人员到解放区来参加新式工商业的建设，同时保护一切公私营企业及其工厂、机器、物资使之不被破坏。（四）注意保护自己的团体和领袖，加强职工内部的团结，严防敌人的挑拨离间。
    报告的第三部分为解放区职工运动的任务。陈云同志首先指出了解放区职工运动是在一种完全新的条件下进行的：工人阶级已经获得解放，并成为国家政权的领导阶级，在国营、公营和合作经营的企业中，已没有劳资关系的矛盾，职工们已经是企业的主人；虽然在私营企业中，仍有劳资关系的存在，但由于职工们在政治上、政权中的领导地位，就保障了职工们不致受到压迫和过分的剥削。因此解放区的职工运动就应该在完全新的方针和政策下来进行。
    在解放区：
    好好学习提高自己　积极推动工业建设
    在这种情况下面，陈云同志指出：解放区职工的任务首先是提高自己的觉悟，好好学习，有组织地自觉地去积极参加新民主主义的各方面建设工作，特别是发展工业生产，以保证革命战争的胜利，满足人民的需要。至此陈云同志更具体地阐述了为着发展工业，而必须解决的一连串的问题。首先是关于工业的计划性。今后必须首先使一切国营、公营企业，都能经过调查研究与全盘筹划，在统一领导、统一计划之下进行生产。其次必须改善国营、公营企业的经营和管理工作，主要是贯彻企业化原则和实行管理民主化。目前工业技术干部的缺乏问题，一方面在现任干部中，提高其工作效能，另一方面还应该开办工业专门学校、职工学校训练班等，培养新的人材。对自动来解放区服务的工业人材和技术人员，应一律欢迎，并很好地团结他们。关于劳动时间问题，在目前空前规模的战争环境下，解放区工厂工人一般应实行八小时至十小时工作制度，除战争紧急需要外，每日劳动时间连加工在内，不得超过十二小时。
    关于工资的规定，陈云同志指出一个原则，即反对平均主义，主张实行交叉累进工资制。评定工资的标准主要是按照职位、能力、技术好坏，劳动态度为标准，不得根据其他条件。女工、青工、童工，一律同工同酬。学徒学习期限不能超过三年，师徒关系应严守尊师爱徒原则。至于职工劳动保护和福利事业，必须由工厂和工会很好地办理，其经费可由工厂付出等于全部工资的若干份及工人缴纳工资的若干份筹措之。
    关于国营、公营企业中的劳动竞赛和劳动英雄运动，陈云同志认为过去这一运动对发展生产曾起了积极的作用，今后仍要提倡，但必须反对形式主义和个人锦标主义的倾向。至于工会工作，陈云同志指出解放区工会工作的任务是在发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的总方针下，团结全体职工，积极劳动，遵守纪律，以及保护职工的日常利益，教育职工等。使职工在国营、公营和合作经营的企业中发挥管理能力；在私营企业中实现监督作用。在个体劳动中，促进技术改良和生产合作。工会会员的征收，必须本自愿原则，尽量争取所有职工加入工会，工会须有切实的真正能够解决群众需要的经常工作，同时并须彻底整顿目前工会工作中官僚主义和形式主义的作风，使工会真正成为职工自己的组织。
    最后，报告的第四部分，陈云同志谈到关于恢复全国总工会的问题。他说，为了保障大会决议的实行，必须成立中国工人阶级统一的全国组织——恢复中华全国总工会，以便指导各地职工群众的行动。这次大会应该责成全国总工会新的执行委员会，继续第一次大革命时期全国总工会的革命传统，迅速组织全国职员和工人，并联合全国各民主党派，各人民团体和少数民族，为迅速推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府在中国的统治，为建立统一的新民主主义的中华人民民主共和国而奋斗到底。至此陈云同志领导全场高呼：全中国工人联合起来，在毛主席的旗帜下前进！
