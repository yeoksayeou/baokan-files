　　Brief Replies
　　△To Comrade Zhang Baowen of the Ci County Government: In the second chapter, preface, first section of "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," the phrase "Our party is about to become the leading party of a unified national people's democratic regime" is correct. It was not a typesetting error in the newspaper.
　　△To Comrade Qi Zhida: Your opinions regarding the technical translation questions of the "Information Bureau's Resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party" have been forwarded to the North China General Branch to telegraph to the Xinhua General Agency. Your comments regarding the unclear printing of the newspaper are very pertinent, and improvements are currently being studied.

    △成磁县政府张宝文同志：重印左派幼稚病第二章前言第一节中“我们党行将成为统一的全国人民民主政权的领导政党”的“行将”二字是不错的，不是报上排颠倒了。
    △齐之达同志：你对于“情报局关于南共的决议”在翻译技术上疑问的意见已转交华北总分社电告新华总社。你对报纸印刷不清所提意见很对，现正研究改进。
