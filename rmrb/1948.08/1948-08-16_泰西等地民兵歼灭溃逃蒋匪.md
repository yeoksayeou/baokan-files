[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] The militia and people of Niuzhuang, Taixi, completely annihilated 36 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had fled Yanzhou. When our army liberated Yanzhou, more than 30 soldiers from the enemy's 84th Division artillery battalion slipped through the net. On the 17th of last month, they passed through Niuzhuang in our Fourth District. The village's militia squad leader Song Shao'an, self-defense captain Ma Yongchen, and farmers' association director Wang Zhongsheng immediately led dozens of people to surround the enemy in the field, shouting slogans: "Brothers who have been deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, surrender quickly! The People's Liberation Army does not kill prisoners. Those who wish to stay will be taken in, and those who wish to leave will be sent away." The panicked enemy immediately laid down their weapons. We captured 36 enemies, seized two 60mm mortars, one 82mm mortar, one light machine gun, four Czech rifles, 35 various shells, and some other bullets.
    
[Another Telegram] On July 15th, more than 40 defeated soldiers of the enemy's Shandong Security First Brigade fled from Wenshang, passing through Xuetun Village in our Jining, Sixth District. They were routed by the village's militia and people, resulting in three enemy soldiers captured, two killed or wounded, and the seizure of seven rifles and more than 150 bullets. On the same day, two militiamen in the Sixth District discovered more than 300 enemies at the north end of the village. They fired two shots at the enemy, causing them to flee in a panic to the east of the village. The two militiamen seized four rifles and a box of shells.
