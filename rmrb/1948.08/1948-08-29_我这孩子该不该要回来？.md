　　Should I Take My Child Back?
    To the Editor:
    I am from Xiaoyao Village, Third District, Qinyang. My family used to have six or seven mu of hillside land. During the famine years, we fled to Shijiagou Village, Qinshui. Due to financial difficulties, we sold our child to Feng Qigui, a landlord in the Central Administrative Village of the Second District of Anze, to be his son. Now that the landlord has been liquidated, the child has ended up herding cattle for Hu Jinping, a primary school teacher. Now, there are only the two of us old folks at home. I am fifty-one years old this year. My eldest child was killed by the Japanese devils, and my second daughter starved to death during the famine years. This is the only child we have left, and he is still sold there. It is really painful to think about it. I have tried to get the child back twice, and the child also wants to come back with me, but the district worker and village cadres do not allow it. Please, Editor, answer me, should I take my child back? Written by Qinyang Civil Education Section.
    Answer: During the famine, you were forced by life to sell your child to a landlord. The family who bought the child was later struggled against and could not raise him, so the child ended up herding cattle for someone else. Now that you want to take him back and the child himself agrees, you can negotiate a solution with his adoptive father. The district and village cadres should assist in mediating the matter according to the specific circumstances.

专栏：询问与答复

　　我这孩子该不该要回来？
    编辑同志：
    我是沁阳三区逍遥村人，从前我家有六七亩坡地，灾荒年逃到沁水石家沟村，因生活困难，将孩子卖给了安泽二区中心行政村地主冯起贵为子，现在该地主已被清算，孩子流落给小学教员胡金贫家里放牛。现在我们老两口子家无别人，我今年五十一岁了，大孩子被日本鬼子杀了，二女儿在灾荒年饿死了，只剩下这一个孩子，还卖在那里，提起来心里实在难受，我去要孩子，已要了两次了，孩子也愿跟我回来，区工作员和村干部都不允许。请编辑同志答复我，看我这孩子该不该要回来？沁阳民教科代笔
    答：你在灾荒时为生活所迫，把孩子卖给了地主；买孩子户后来又被斗争，不能抚养，孩子流落给人家放牛。现在你既愿要回，孩子本人也同意，可与其养父协商解决，区村干部应按具体情况帮助调处。
