Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th: Xi'an News: The good reputation of the Northwest People's Liberation Army for strictly enforcing urban policies and mass discipline, and protecting the interests of the people, has been deeply imprinted in the minds of people from all walks of life in Xi'an, the heart of the Hu bandits' rule. A businessman encountered a PLA sentry in @ County. The sentry kindly asked him what he was carrying. He himself said he was carrying four hundred silver dollars and 20 million enemy notes. The sentry let him pass. When he reached Liquan, he encountered Kuomintang troops who immediately searched him all over and robbed him of all his hard currency and cash. He complained everywhere about these two different encounters, and said, "I understand who I should support and welcome." After the news of the PLA protecting large and small industrial and commercial firms in Baoji spread to Xi'an, business circles scrambled to inquire about all the details. A certain KMT provincial senator once said to a person in charge of a coal mine: "Don't run away when the PLA comes. They have urban policies and will protect you to produce well. Don't be afraid." Among lower-level personnel and even some higher-level personnel in the KMT party and government, they also expressed trust in the PLA's lenient policies. Some deceived and coerced personnel, seeing the PLA's strict discipline and strict implementation of the policy of not questioning those who were coerced, dispelled their doubts caused by listening to the KMT's reactionary and absurd propaganda, and expressed that they no longer wanted to work for the KMT. A certain KMT county party secretary fled to Xi'an and complained a lot, admitting that the "Communist killing and arson" and other things he had propagated in the past were all lies, and said pessimistically and desperately: "The KMT's credibility is completely bankrupt, and we can no longer sit in the party headquarters and deceive ourselves." A certain KMT provincial senator returned to Xi'an from the Western Shaanxi Sub-district and sighed to everyone he met: "Baoji is finished! Baoji has lost the hearts of the people! The hearts of the people are lost!" The "Jingwei victory news" fabricated by the Hu bandits to cover up his defeat was ridiculed everywhere. A certain KMT government employee who returned to Xi'an from the Western Shaanxi Sub-district said: "The people have long ignored the news in the Xi'an newspapers. The party, government, and military in the Jingwei area have been beaten to pieces. Where did the victory come from!"

　　执行政策纪律严明
  　解放军美誉传西安
    【新华社西北二十六日电】西安消息：西北人民解放军严格执行城市政策及群众纪律，保护人民利益的美誉，已深印胡匪统治心脏西安的各界人士心目中。一位商人在＠县遇到解放军的哨兵，哨兵和霭地问他带了什么，他自己说带了四百银洋及二千万敌钞，哨兵就让他通过。他走到醴泉遇着国民党军，上来就遍身搜查，将他的硬币及现款全部抢走。他到处诉他说这两种不同的遭遇，并说：“我明白了我该拥护谁和欢迎谁。”解放军在宝鸡保护大小工商行家的消息传到西安后，工商界争着打听一切细节。某省蒋方参议员曾对某一煤矿的负责人说：“解放军来了不要跑，人家有城市政策，会保护你们好好生产的，不要害怕。”在国民党党政中下级人员甚至个别的较高级人员中，也对解放军的宽大政策表示信任。某些被欺骗被胁从的人员，因见解放军纪律严明和严格执行胁从不问的政策，打消了他们因听了国民党的反动无稽宣传而产生的疑虑，并表示再不愿替国民党工作。某县国民党党部书记逃至西安后曾大发牢骚，自供过去所宣传的“共产党杀人放火”等都是谎话，并悲观绝望地说：“国民党的信誉完全破产了，我们不能再坐在党部里自己哄骗自己。”某蒋方省议员由宝鸡返抵西安，见人即慨叹说：“宝鸡完了！宝鸡人心失了！人心失了！”胡匪为掩饰他的失败而捏造的“泾渭胜利消息”，到处都受到嘲笑。某一由西府分区返抵西安的国民党政府职员说：“西安报纸的消息，老百姓早就不理。泾渭地区党政军，被人家打得支离破碎，哪来什么胜利！”
