　　Letting the People Support the Person to Run It
  　The Dongzaoyuan Cooperative is Revived

　　[North Yue News] The Dongzaoyuan cooperative in the fifth district of Jianping, led by Liu Peijian, has received enthusiastic support from the masses. The cooperative was established in 1946 and organized and promoted sideline industries such as weaving and transportation throughout the village. Last year, it also created methods for providing substitute cultivation and supplying school fees, which won a flag of commendation from the former Hebei-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Office. There are 43 households in the village, with 30 male laborers, plus 5 small donkeys counted as 5 laborers, totaling 35 laborers. Seven households in the village need substitute cultivation, with 43 mu of land, requiring a total of 1,080 workdays, averaging more than 35 workdays per laborer, making the substitute cultivation burden heavy. Dongzaoyuan has an elementary school, with teachers' monthly salaries of about 100 jin of rice. The annual need is more than 1,000 jin of rice. After all the grain production in the village is calculated, the education expenditure averages more than 9 jin of rice per share. In view of these difficulties of the masses, the cooperative called on each laborer to invest 1,000 yuan in the spring, raising a total of 33,000 yuan as a substitute cultivation fund; and collected 23,000 yuan at 10 yuan per share as an education fund. The profits from the fund and 20% of the original cooperative profits were drawn as public welfare funds, hiring two long-term workers, some monthly work and odd jobs, and buying one and a half donkeys, helping the school with 70 jin of rice per month. The problems of substitute cultivation and education were completely solved, and the masses were all delighted. After the work team arrived in the village last November, Liu Peijian, who was originally a middle peasant, was wrongly classified as a rich peasant and was subjected to liquidation. Comrade Qi of the work team also called on the masses to "overthrow Liu Peijian." Most of the masses believed that doing so would cause the cooperative to collapse.閻Zongyou, chairman of the poor peasant association, also said, "There's no need to overthrow him, he's not赖 [lazy?]." Qi said this was a landlord-rich peasant ideology, "Rich peasants are not worthy of running cooperatives," and insisted on getting Liu Peijian out of the cooperative, and asked Yang Cuihua to tear up the flag of commendation from the administrative office. After Liu Peijian left the cooperative, the poor peasant association appointed poor peasants Yan Zonghe and Yang Cuihua as director and deputy director. Because Yan and Yang had no experience, the cooperative had seven or eight thousand jin of rice in storage,不敢买 [did not dare buy], and 又不敢卖 [again did not dare to sell]. In two and a half months, they only sold more than a dozen bolts of cloth and more than 50 jin of salt in the village. The director and deputy director did not trust the original accountant, which made the old accountant Liang Fengtian uneasy about his work. The director and deputy director took the lead in eating white flour, rice, and pork in the cooperative. Even Liu Jinxiu and other six people who helped with chores often ate in the cooperative, burning coal all day long. The lamp oil for the village office was also paid for by the cooperative. In more than two months, more than 160,000 yuan was spent. The weaving workers, seeing that the new director did not understand the business, embezzled ten one-丈 [ten-foot] long wide belts and one mattress cover woven by the cooperative. There was no money to hire long-term workers for substitute cultivation. By the second month of the lunar calendar, 345 substitute cultivation workers were assigned in the village, and the school could not start. The masses discussed and said, "You have turned the cooperative into this! Who elected you to run the cooperative?" "Pay back our cooperative!" Seeing this situation, Yan Zonghe and others discussed with the poor peasant association to ask Liu Peijian to come back (at this time, Qi had been transferred). At the village representative meeting, it was decided to ask Liu to run it. Liu refused. Finally, the county representative talked with the responsible comrade in the county, and it turned out that the classification of his status was wrong. After returning to the village, his status was changed, and the wrongly confiscated property was returned before Liu took over. In mid-February of the lunar calendar, two and a half long-term workers were hired for substitute cultivation, the school started again, and weaving and other businesses became active again.

　　让群众拥护的人来办
  　东枣园合作社复活了
    【北岳讯】建屏五区东枣园刘佩剑领导的合作社，得到群众热烈拥护。该社成立于一九四六年，组织与推动了全村纺织、运输等副业。去年又创办代耕与供给小学校费用的办法，曾得到原冀晋行署的奖旗。该村四十三户，男劳力三十个，加上五个小驴折五个劳力，共三十五个劳力，全村需要代耕的七户，地四十三亩，共需工一千零八十个，每个劳力平均三十五个多工，代耕负担繁重。东枣园设有小学一座，教员每月薪金米百斤左右，全年需米千余斤，全村产粮分折只教育经费每分平均即达九斤多米。该社鉴于群众此种困难，遂于夫春号召每个劳力入股一千，共集资三万三千元为代耕基金；按每分十元，共集得二万三千元做教育基金。由基金所得红利及原社红利中抽百分之二十的公益金，雇了两个长工，一个月工及零工一部，买了一个半驴，每月帮助学校七十斤米，代耕与办学问题即全部解决，群众莫不称快。去年十一月工作组到村后，将原为中农的刘佩剑错划为富农成份，加以清算。工作组齐同志并号召群众“搬了刘佩剑”，群众大都认为这样做合作社会垮台，贫农团主席阎宗有也说：“不用搬他，人家不赖。”齐就说这是地富思想，“富农不配办合作社”，“你们思想没搞通”，定要叫刘佩剑出合作社，并叫杨翠花撕了行署的奖旗。刘佩剑出社后，贫农团叫贫农阎宗和、杨翠花任正、副主任，阎、杨因没有经验，社里存着七、八千斤米，买不敢买，卖又不敢卖，两个半月只在本村卖了十几匹布，五十多斤盐。正副主任对原来的会计不信任，弄得旧会计梁风田也不安心工作了。正副主任带头在社里吃白面、大米、猪肉，连帮助打杂的刘金秀等六人也常在社里吃饭，整天生着煤火，村里办公的灯油也由社里出，两个多月花了十六万多元。织布工人看着新主任不懂业务，就贪污了该社织的十条一丈长的宽裤带，一个褥面。代耕的长工也没钱雇了。到阴历二月初，就在村里派代耕工三百四十五个，学校也开不了学。群众议论纷纷说：“你们把合作社办成个这！谁选你们办合作社的？”“赔我们的合作社！”阎宗和等看到这情况，就和贫农团商量着请刘佩剑回来（此时齐已他调）。在村民大会上通过叫刘办，刘不办，最后县代表在县里和负责同志一谈，原来成份订错了。回村后将他的成份改过来，退回错斗的浮财，刘才接办了。阴历二月中旬又雇了两个半代耕长工，学校又开了学，织布及其他业务又活跃起来。（何建平、董明）
