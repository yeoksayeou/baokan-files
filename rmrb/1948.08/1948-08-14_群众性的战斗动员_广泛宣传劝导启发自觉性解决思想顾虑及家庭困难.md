　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th. The return-to-unit movement in various parts of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is becoming a mass combat mobilization under the policy of "inspiring consciousness, promoting hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries, and conducting detailed research and appropriately resolving various ideological concerns and family difficulties of those who have left the units."

　　In mobilizing soldiers to return to their units, Ansai County has adopted a working method that combines general propaganda and persuasion with specific research and resolution of soldiers' ideological concerns and family difficulties, with a focus on inspiring their consciousness. Currently, out of the 120 soldiers who left their units and remained at home in the county, except for 20 who have not recovered from injuries and illnesses, the rest are prepared to return to their units within the next few days. The county first widely publicized the significance of returning to the units, organized return-to-unit work groups in the villages, and mobilized relatives of soldiers to conduct persuasion and encouragement. The return-to-unit group in the Fifth Township of the First District persuaded six soldiers to return to their units in a few days. Secondly, it seriously addressed the family life and production difficulties of soldiers. For example, the Seventh District helped families of returning soldiers and general families of martyrs and soldiers who had livelihood difficulties by providing more than six shi and seven dou of coarse grains and more than 3,000 jin of firewood within half a month, and mobilized the masses to harvest wheat for the families of returning soldiers who lacked labor. In the work of returning to the units, it is extremely important to mobilize cadres to take the lead in promoting the masses. Guo Yanming, the group leader of the party in the Fifth Township of the First District, originally hid his son, who had returned from the front, in another township. After the party group meeting discussed the significance of returning to the unit, he brought his son back and asked him to return to the unit. Therefore, it influenced other party members, cadres, and the masses, and everyone no longer sheltered soldiers who had left their units and returned home among their relatives and friends.

　　Ma Shengcai, a young soldier of a certain unit, lost contact with his unit during the Baoji Campaign and went straight home. Along the way, he saw the various crimes of the Hu bandits ravaging the border area. After returning home, he saw that his home had been looted by the Hu bandits, and he could only survive with the government's relief and assistance. At this time, Ma Shengcai felt ashamed and uneasy about his action of not looking for his unit and going straight home. When he heard the news of welcoming returning soldiers, he ran from Ansai to Yan'an and asked the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region Government to handle the formalities for returning to the unit. He resolutely said: "If the Kuomintang bandit gang is not eliminated in one day, my gun will not be put down in one day."

　　Lan Jinhua, a soldier from Liujia Yuan in the Third District of Yanchang, and his uncles and brothers, returned home in early May. After living at home for a month, they saw that there were no difficulties at home and were treated favorably by the masses, so they felt extremely ashamed and regretful, and registered with the government to return to the unit. After hearing this news, the masses raised money to send them off. They firmly expressed to their relatives: "After returning to the unit this time, we will work harder to kill the enemy."

　　After returning to his unit, Liu Guoqing, a soldier from a certain unit, wrote a letter to his family saying: "Everything is fine with me back in the unit, and the superiors have not given me any punishment. I have made up my mind ideologically to be a soldier for the people for a long time."

　　群众性的战斗动员
    广泛宣传劝导启发自觉性解决思想顾虑及家庭困难
    【新华社西北八日电】陕甘宁边区各地归队运动，在“启发自觉性，发扬对国民党反动派的敌忾同仇精神，并经过细密的研究与适当的解决离队人员的各种思想顾虑及家庭困难等问题”的方针下，正成为群众性的战斗动员。
    安塞县在动员战士归队工作中，采取了一般宣传说服与具体的研究、解决战士思想顾虑及家庭困难相结合的工作方法，并着重启发其自觉性。现该县离队留家的一百二十名战士中，除二十名因伤病未愈外，其余均准备日内归队。该县此次首先广泛宣传归队意义，在乡村组织归队工作小组，发动战士亲属进行劝导鼓励。一区五乡归队小组在几天内劝说了六个战士归队。其次为认真解决战士家庭生活与生产困难。如七区在半月内以粗粮六石七斗及柴三千余斤帮助了生活困难的归队战士家属及一般烈属、军属，并动员群众给缺乏劳动力的归队战士家里割麦子。在归队工作中，动员干部带头推动群众，至为重要。一区五乡党的小组长郭彦明，本来把由前方回来的儿子隐藏在外乡，经党的小组会讨论了归队意义后，他就把儿子找回来叫他归队。因此影响了其他党员、干部、群众，大家都再不包庇亲友中离队回家的战士了。
    某部青年战士马生财，在宝鸡战役中与部队失掉联络而径自回家，沿途看到胡军蹂躏边区的种种罪行，回家后，看见家里已被胡匪抢劫一空，全靠政府的救济和帮助才能生活。马生财这时对自己没有去找部队而径自回家的行动感到愧悔不安，当听到欢迎归队的消息，他从安塞跑到延安，向边区政府民政厅要求办理归队手续。他毅然的说：“国民党匪帮一天不消灭，我的枪就一天不放下。”
    延长三区柳家塬战士兰金花和他的叔伯兄弟，五月初回家后，在家住了一个月，看到家里没有什么困难，并受群众优待，因而感到愧悔万分，乃向政府报名归队。群众听到这消息后，大家凑钱给他们送行。他们向亲戚们坚决表示：“这次归队后要更努力杀敌人。”
    某部战士刘国清归队后给他家里写了一封信说：“我回部队一切都好，上级未给我任何处分。我在思想上已下了决心，要长期为人民当战士。”
