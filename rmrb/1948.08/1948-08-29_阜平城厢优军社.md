Fuping Chengxiang Military Support Cooperative

"Don't mention 1,500 yuan, even 15,000 or 30,000 yuan, we are willing to pay." This is the general sentiment of the people of Fuping Chengxiang towards the Military Support Cooperative. Indeed, the Chengxiang Military Support Cooperative has done many things, reducing a lot of labor burden for the people. Last January, Fuping Chengxiang initiated the establishment of a Military Support Cooperative. Each member who was supposed to provide substitute labor contributed 1,500 yuan as a share. With 198 people in the whole village, a total of 297,000 yuan was raised, and the Military Support Cooperative was established. However, these limited funds, after construction expenses, only left a little over 100,000 yuan, which greatly limited business operations. At that time, the seven staff members were determined to run the Military Support Cooperative well, to reduce the burden on the masses and strengthen the work of supporting the military. Six staff members voluntarily contributed 400,000 yuan as capital, but it was still not enough. They then purchased some goods on credit from various cooperatives and shops in the market for rapid turnover, barely managing to sustain operations. Later, due to rising prices, they could no longer purchase on credit. After experiencing a period of difficulty, they borrowed another 2 million yuan from the bank. Huashang Bank also provided assistance in terms of economy and materials. Coupled with the staff's hundredfold efforts, after a year and a half, the capital has now expanded to more than 13 million yuan.

The Military Support Cooperative has two people engaged in long-distance trade, selling cloth and livestock, and frequently operating in Shizhuang, Hunyuan, Lingshou, Xingtang, Ertai and other places. The other five people who stay at home manage the shop, selling cloth, matches, bedding, and other daily necessities for the masses. In addition to general business operations, it is stipulated that military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs can buy things from the cooperative at the original price, and those who have no money can buy on credit. Those who are truly poor can have their debts waived after being reviewed and approved by the village representative meeting. Once, more than 300,000 yuan of external debt was waived during settlement. (It is not advisable to encourage this method, which places an extra burden on the people of the village and is detrimental to the interests of the cooperative members, as it allows the exceptionally poor among military personnel, workers, and family members of martyrs to have their debts waived after being reviewed and approved by the farmers' representative meeting. The special difficulties of these people should be resolved uniformly by the government. – Editor) Disabled soldiers who do business in the streets can purchase goods from the cooperative at prices 5% or 10% lower than the market price and sell them in the market. If they cannot sell them or if prices fall, they can return them, because disabled soldiers cannot afford to lose money. The Military Support Cooperative often lends funds to disabled soldiers to enable them to engage in small-scale production. In order to especially care for disabled veterans, the cooperative helps them buy and sell goods in other places without charging any fees, and the cooperative is responsible for any losses.

Out of the 485 households in the whole village, 162 are military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs, accounting for 33% of the total number of households. In the past, all members of military families were provided with substitute labor, regardless of whether they had labor at home. Some people who were doing business also had substitute labor provided for them. Those who had labor at home, lived well, and could hire people also relied on substitute labor, which increased the labor burden on the masses. This year, we began to convene meetings of military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs to discuss the matter. We adopted a method of self-reporting and public discussion, and based on their living conditions, whether they had labor, and whether they needed it, we decided that 71 out of the 162 households needed full substitute labor or partial subsidies. In this way, we prompted military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs who had labor to participate in production, which is estimated to save 2,100 workdays. In terms of substitute labor, because the organization and leadership were not good in the past, those who provided substitute labor rarely worked in the fields, and some deliberately loafed on the job. For example, two people were assigned to Zhao Babu to plow the land for a day, but they did not even plow one-tenth of an acre. People were assigned to Lao Qin to repair two houses, which took more than 100 workdays (enough workdays to build several new houses). Also, because most of them were small businessmen who did not know how to farm, they not only did not do a good job in the fields, but also affected their business. Some hired short-term laborers, but most of them were "contracted" (no meals provided). The short-term laborers ate three meals a day, so they did not do much work in the fields. Therefore, not only was labor wasted and the burden on the masses increased, but also the land of military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs was not well cultivated. Therefore, under the leadership of the Military Support Cooperative, a "Military Support Transfer Depot" can be set up, specializing in accommodating passing merchants and porters, for the purpose of accumulating fertilizer for supporting the military. Since the Lunar New Year, more than 1,000 loads of manure have been distributed to military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs to solve the fertilizer shortage. Secondly, attached to the store, there are four full-time laborers (including one general manager) who are specifically responsible for providing substitute labor for military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs. During the busy farming season, monthly and short-term laborers are hired, and the full-time laborers lead them to work for military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs, so the work is done more and more effectively. From the beginning of production to now, a total of 1,600 workdays have been hired, saving 1,500 workdays. The wages of these 1,600 workdays and the four full-time laborers for the whole year are 1.5 million yuan, which is completely paid from the profits (in the past six months, in addition to consumption, a net profit of 10 million yuan has been made). Each member can save 30 to 40 workdays. Therefore, some members said: "It is worth it to pay 1,500 yuan to save 30 to 40 workdays, even if we are asked to pay 30,000 yuan." Military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs are also very satisfied that they have harvested more grain from the land.

Manager Wang told us: "Our Military Support Cooperative is like a supply department for military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs. Whenever they have any difficulties, the Military Support Cooperative helps them solve them." The fact is indeed so. Last year, during the Lunar New Year, the cooperative bought 500 kilograms of pork, 60 "ke" of rice, and 600 kilograms of white flour, ready to be distributed to all military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs in the village for the New Year. At the meeting, military personnel, workers, and disabled soldiers who were living well voluntarily gave up their share, saying: "We are living well, we don't need it, we would rather give it to the poor military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs." At ordinary times, whoever does not have clothes to wear goes to the cooperative to buy them, and whoever does not have food to eat goes to the cooperative to borrow it. In particular, when poor military personnel, workers, disabled soldiers, and family members of martyrs have weddings or funerals, the cooperative always contributes money to help. For example, the medical expenses for Zheng Guosheng's mother's illness and the coffin expenses for Yang Defu's mother's death were all covered by the cooperative, and even the mourning cloth was paid for by the cooperative. This expense has amounted to more than 300,000 yuan in more than half a year. The reason why the Fuping Chengxiang Military Support Cooperative has been able to do well is because the staff members have a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people. They are never afraid of hardship and fatigue, and they work day and night, rain or shine. Sometimes, in order not to miss the market, they walk hundreds of "li" in one night. Staff member Wen Xiting walked more than 200 "li" in one day and one night. Staff member Liu Shengli said: "If I were working for myself, I would have to rest for a few days after one trip; but at the cooperative, I am working for everyone." Not only that, but they always take less during each dividend distribution. For example, in the first phase, each yuan should have been distributed 2.8 yuan, but they only wanted to distribute 1.4 yuan, and they were willing to use the rest for military support. Because they lead by example and serve the masses, they have won the praise of the masses. They are now planning to further expand and develop their business.

　　阜平城厢优军社
    “莫说出一千五百元，就是出一万五、三万咱也愿意。”这是阜平城厢人们对优军社的普遍反映。的确，城厢优军社办了许多事情，给人们减少了不少劳役负担。去年一月阜平城厢发起成立优军社，每个应代耕的队员入股一五○○元，全村一九八人，共集资二十九万七千元，优军社成立了。但是，这些有限的资金，除了建设开支外，仅仅剩下了十几万元，使营业受到很大限制。当时七个职员下定决心，一定要把优军社搞好，为群众减轻负担，加强优军工作。有六个职员自动拿出四十万元作为资金，仍然不足使用，又在市面上各合作社、商店赊了些货物，迅速周转，勉强支持着，后来因物价上涨，赊不成了，遭受一段困难之后，又从银号里贷了二百万元，华商行从经济上物质上又给予帮助，加上职员的百倍努力，经过一年半的时间，到现在，资金已扩大到一千三百余万元了。
    优军社有两个人作远途贸易，贩卖布匹、牲口，经常活动在石庄、浑源、灵寿、行唐、二台等地，其余留在家里的五个人，坐铺经营布匹、洋火、铺衬等群众日用品。除一般营业外，规定军、工、荣、烈属到社里买东西，按原价售给，没钱的可以赊欠。确系贫苦的，经村代表会审查通过，可废除欠帐。一次结账时，有三十余万元的外欠被废除了。（军、工、烈属中特别贫苦的，经过农代会审查通过，赊帐可以不还，这是额外地增加了本村人民负担而且与社员利益有损，这种方法不应提倡。这些人的特殊困难，应由政府统一解决。——编者）荣军在街上做买卖的，可以从社里以低于市价百分之五或十的价格赊货，到市上贩卖，如果卖不了或因物价跌落，可以退还，因为荣军是赔不起的。优军社经常借给荣军资金，使他们从事小生产，为了特别照顾残废荣军，社里替他们到外地代买代卖，不收丝毫代价，赔了由社里负责。
    全村四八五户，军、工、荣、烈属有一六二户，占户数的百分之卅三，应该代耕的队员一九八人。过去军属不管家中有无劳力均全部代耕。有的自己做买卖，家中也要代耕。家中有劳力的，生活好，能雇人的，也依靠代耕，增加了群众的劳役负担。今年开始，即召集军、工、荣、烈属开会讨论，采取了自报公议方式，根据生活好坏，有无劳动力，需要与不需要，决定一六二户中，七一户需要全代耕或补助一部分。这样一来，促使了有劳力的军、工、荣、烈属参加生产，估计可节省二一○○个工。在代耕方面，因为过去组织领导的不好，代耕的到地里干活很少，有的故意偷懒，如给赵八九派了两个人翻了一天地，还不到一分地；给老秦派人修理两间房子，用了一百多个工（足够盖多间新房子的用工），也有的因为大部分是小商人，不会种地，不但地里的活干不好，还影响了作买卖。有的雇短工，但也多是“包干”（不管饭），短工一天做上三顿饭，到地里也就干不上什么活了。因此不仅浪费了工，增加了群众负担，而且军、工、荣、烈属的地也种不好。于是在优军社领导之下，可设一“优军转运货栈”，专门留住过往商人和脚夫，目的为积肥优军，过年以来已出一千余担粪，分给各军、工、荣、烈属，解决肥料困难。其次，附属在店里的，雇有长工四人（内总管一人），专负给军工荣烈属代耕之责，农忙时，雇月工和短工，中长工带领，分头给军工荣烈属去做，因此活干的又多又实在。从生产开始到现在，共雇了一千六百个工，节省一千五百个工。这一千六百个工和四个长工全年的工资为一百五十万元，完全由利润中开支（这半年除消耗外获纯利一千万元）。每个队员可省三、四十个工。因此，有的队员说：“掏了一千五百元，省了三、四十个工，就是叫咱掏三万也合适”。军工荣烈属地里多打了粮食，也感到很满意。
    王经理告诉我们说：“我们的优军社，好象军工荣烈属的供给部，他们有了什么困难，都是优军社来帮助解决。”事实也确是如此。去年过年的时候，社里买了五百斤猪肉，六十柯大米，六百斤白面，准备分送全村军工荣烈属过年用。在会议上，生活好的军工荣烈自动不要，他们说：“我们生活好，不要了，情愿送给贫苦的军工荣烈属。”在平时，谁家没有穿的便到社里去买，没吃的便到社里去借。特别是贫苦的军工荣烈属过红白喜事的时候，社里也总要出钱帮助。如郑国胜的母亲有病吃了的药费和杨德福的母亲死后的棺材费，全由社里挡了，甚至连孝布也由社里开支。半年多这笔开支也在三十万元以上。阜平城厢优军社所以能够办好，是由于社内职员有高度为人民服务的热忱，他们从来不怕吃苦耐劳，不怕风吹雨打，白天黑夜的干。有时为了不误赶集，一夜走百十里地。职员温喜亭一天一夜走过二百多里地。职员刘生黎说：“要是干自己的，走一趟回来就得歇几天；到社里为了大家伙”。不仅这样，他们每次股金分红时，总是少分。如第一期每元该分二元八角，他们只要分一元四角，其余愿作为优军之用。由于他们以身作则，为群众服务，所以博得群众的称赞。他们现在还在计划着更进一步的扩大与发展业务。
