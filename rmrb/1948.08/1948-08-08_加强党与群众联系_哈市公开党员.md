    Strengthening the Party's Ties with the Masses
    Harbin Publicizes Party Members
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 3rd】 The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to strengthen the Party's ties with the masses and expand the Party's influence, has begun to publicize the Party's branches and members in schools, factories, and government organs. The Harbin Youth Cadre School was the first to do so on the 12th of last month. After two weeks of preparation and deliberation, the school's General Party Branch Committee convened a school-wide meeting to explain the significance of publicizing the Party and announced the list of the General Branch Committee and all Party members. After the public announcement, Party members generally studied harder and strengthened self-criticism, greatly enhancing the Party's prestige among the masses. Within ten days of the public announcement, 56 people formally requested to join the Party from the General Branch or branches, and many students voluntarily came to the Party to discuss various issues. The enthusiasm for study among the school's more than 300 Party members and non-Party students generally soared, presenting an unprecedented atmosphere of close unity and mutual assistance. The Harbin Tram Factory's Party Branch also convened a factory-wide employee meeting on the 16th of last month to publicize the Party's organization and list of Party members. The branch has played a leading role in production work for the past two years, and 18 of its 22 members have been selected as heroes and model workers. The creation of parts such as milling cutters, sweepers, and connectors was led by Party members who organized the masses to complete them. After the public announcement, the Party's prestige was extremely high, and non-Party veteran heroes Jin Hailiang, worker Liu Chunhua, and others expressed their determination to strive to become glorious Communist Party members under the education of the Party and with everyone's help.
