[Ji Zhong Telegram] Village cadres in Beiwangli, Wu Jia, and other villages in Zhao County have engaged in serious phenomena that separate them from the masses, such as eating public meals and issuing coercive orders. Village cadres in Beiwangli ate over 320 jin of wheat during the grain requisition, while only a little over 1,000 jin of wheat was requisitioned in total. Village cadres in Jia Lü have been eating public meals since spring. From the wheat requisition to the present, more than 20 people eat every day, consuming a total of 400 jin of millet. They even dispatched 30 middle-peasant households to regularly deliver food to them. Village cadres in Qing'an Village ate 700,000 yuan worth of "victory fruits" for half a month, starting from the wheat requisition. When district cadres discovered this, instead of educating and stopping them, they mistakenly believed that village cadres wouldn't work if they didn't eat public meals. During the deployment of wheat requisition in Wu Jia Village, cadres did not calculate based on the normal yield of wheat fields, nor did they consider the difficulties of widowed and orphaned households. Instead, they uniformly allocated 16 jin of wheat per mu. Poor peasant Ma Lao Zhao was unable to pay the wheat, so his family of six was driven out and the door was sealed. Four other poor widows were also driven out of their homes. In He Zhuang, when people argued and fought in a cellar, the cadres locked them inside. During the wheat requisition, nine poor peasant households who failed to pay the wheat were also locked in the cellar. These serious phenomena have not attracted the attention of county and district cadres. (Such bad tendencies and behaviors – illegally acting wildly, issuing coercive orders, gorging on public funds, increasing the burden on the masses, and severely separating themselves from the masses in violation of the masses' interests – should be immediately rectified. The Zhao County cadres' bureaucratic attitude of not asking or caring, and the district cadres' tailism of appeasing and echoing after discovering the problems, while abandoning leadership, are equally wrong. It is hoped that the county and district leading organs will immediately conduct thorough self-criticism and quickly correct these errors. – Editor)

　　北王里等村村干违法乱干
  　县干部不管不问　区干部迁就附和
    【冀中电】赵县北王里、吴贾等村村干，发生吃公饭、强迫命令等严重脱离群众的现象。北王里村干部，在麦征时吃公饭，吃了三百二十多斤麦子，但麦征才完成了一千多斤。贾吕村干部从春天就吃公饭，从麦征到现在，每天都是二十多人吃，共吃了四百斤小米，甚至派了三十户中农经常给他们送饭。清岸村村干部自麦征起，吃了半月的胜利果实共七十万元，区干发觉这事情，不加以教育和制止，反错认为村干部不吃公饭就不做工作了。吴贾村干部，在布置麦征时，未按照麦田的常年产量计算，也未照顾到孤寡户的困难，一律按每亩征麦十六斤分配；贫农马老朝因无力缴麦，一家六口人被赶出来，并封了门。还有四家贫苦寡妇，也被赶出了门。何庄有人在地窖里吵嘴打架，干部们就把他们禁闭在里边。麦征时，有九户贫农没缴上麦子，也被关在地窖里。这些严重现象，并未引起县区干部的注意。（象这样违法乱干强迫命令，大吃公饭，增加群众负担，严重的脱离群众，违犯群众利益的恶劣作风和行为，应该立即正时。该县县干部采取不闻不问的官僚主义态度，与区干发觉后迁就附和放弃领导的尾巴主义，同样是错误的。希望该县县区领导机关立即深入检讨，迅速纠正。——编者）
