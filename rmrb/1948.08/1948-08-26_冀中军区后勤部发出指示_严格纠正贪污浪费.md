[Jizhong Electric] During the inventory checks in May and June, the Logistics Department of the Jizhong Military Region discovered serious issues in various units, including unclear financial procedures, chaotic management, and instances of embezzlement and waste. The Sixth Preparatory Branch damaged 17 types of equipment belonging to the masses, totaling 217,000 yuan. The Fourth Preparatory Branch lost equipment belonging to the masses worth over 100,000 yuan. None of these losses have been compensated. The Third Land Branch lost 45 blankets. The First Land Branch lost 880 bowls and 56 oil lamps in May and June. The officer in charge of grain and provisions at the Third Preparatory Branch kept no accounts at all, and the accounts for grain and provisions at the Supply Section of the General Preparatory Hospital were also incomplete. The Fifth Branch had not published its accounts for several months. Many units had discrepancies between cash and inventory. Many units made illegal loans that were never repaid, and the lenders did not pursue repayment. At one branch, private loans amounted to over 65,000 yuan. Some branches even used the convalescents' food expenses for other purposes. Some units reported fewer individuals than were actually present; the Sixth Branch once overstated the number of family meals by 300 days in a single month and reported 56 lightly wounded soldiers as seriously wounded. One branch overstated light casualty rations by 812 days and heavy casualty rations by 1,128 days over six months, receiving an extra 276,000 yuan in vegetable funds. These serious issues arose because the supply management work in various units was not standardized, the grain and financial system and economic procedures were not strict, and some people took the opportunity to embezzle funds. A deputy section chief at a preparatory hospital embezzled over 100,000 yuan. Some medical personnel embezzled medicine; the Sixth Branch found 99 types of drugs and equipment from improper sources among 32 people.

In order to overcome these undesirable tendencies, the department specifically instructed all units to conscientiously abide by the supply system, strictly implement budgets and final accounts, ensure accurate personnel numbers, and resolutely correct the practice of underreporting figures. If any errors occur, the military and political leaders of each unit will be held responsible. At the same time, strictly manage materials and disbursement procedures. All materials, medicines,慰劳品（comfort items）, and the belongings and money of martyrs should be carefully registered. Consumption, actual inventory, loss, and damage should be reported monthly. The dates of admission and discharge of convalescents should be accurately recorded. Economic democracy should be implemented, with accounts reconciled every ten days and summarized monthly, ensuring timely publication. Leaders at all levels should lead by example, strictly investigate and appropriately handle criminal acts of embezzlement and waste, and ensure that rewards and punishments are clearly defined. Attention should also be paid to strengthening the education of workers and convalescents on the care of public property. Staff members are not allowed to eat the food of convalescents, and public property, bedding, and equipment may not be borrowed at will without the approval of higher authorities, nor may public funds be used for trafficking. Staff members must not privately use comfort items, belongings and money of martyrs, medicines, or equipment.
