　　People Mournfully Commemorate "Independence"
    India is Increasingly Becoming a Vassal
  　Telecommunications Agency Comments on Indian "Independence" Anniversary
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 23rd] A telecommunications agency reporter in Bombay commented on August 15th on the first anniversary of Indian "independence," stating: One year ago today, India obtained "independence" from Britain; but now, in Bombay, Delhi, and Calcutta, many workers are using black flags to "celebrate" the "independence" anniversary. Farmers, students, and middle-class intellectuals share the same sorrowful feelings. The past year has been a year of deepening crisis for India. The Nehru government has not implemented a single social reform or nationalization plan, while the cost of living has risen sharply to more than four times the pre-war level. With the abolition of price controls on food and textiles, millions of people are facing poverty. Today, India's prisons are as crowded as they were during the worst periods of direct British rule; the majority of the working class and trade union leaders are in prison. In foreign affairs, India has even less autonomy than a year ago, and it is increasingly becoming a vassal of Western imperialism.

　　人民沉痛纪念“独立”
    印度正日益成为附庸
  　电通社评印“独立”周年
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】电通社驻孟买记者于八月十五日评印度“独立”一周年称：一年以前的今日，印度从英国手中取得了“独立”；但现在，孟买，德里和加尔各答，许多工人用黑旗来“庆祝”“独立”周年纪念日，农民、学生及中层知识分子，也怀着同样沉痛的心情。去年曾是印度危机加深的一年，尼赫鲁政府对于社会改革及国有化计划没有实行过一项，而生活费用却已急剧上涨到超过战前水准的四倍。粮食与纺织品的价格管制取消后，数百万人正面临着穷困。今日印度的监狱和英国直接统治的最恶劣时期一样拥挤；工人阶级和工会领袖大多数都在监狱中。在外交方面，印度比一年前更少自主的能力，它正日益成为西方帝国主义的附庸。
