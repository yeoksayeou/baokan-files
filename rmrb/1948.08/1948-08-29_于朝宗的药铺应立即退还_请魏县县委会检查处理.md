　　Yu Chaozong's Pharmacy Should Be Returned Immediately - Please Inspect and Handle This, Wei County County Committee
    Comrade Editor:
    Before the July 7th Incident, I owned 100 mu of land and had a family of thirteen or fourteen people. My eldest son was a Communist Party member. Because he participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was persecuted by the enemy and puppets, and the whole family fled to other villages, living by begging. My second son, Yu Peijie, scrimped and saved to open a small pharmacy in Jiacun Village, Second District, Wei County. After seven or eight years of hard work, it had grown to a modest scale by the time the Japanese surrendered. However, the village cadres of Jiacun Village, not understanding the industrial and commercial policies, unreasonably apportioned and increased the burden. At that time, because my hometown had been liberated, I was preparing to move the pharmacy back to my hometown to operate in peace. Only because the houses at home were inconvenient, the move was slow, and the village cadres of Jiacun Village confiscated all the medicine cabinets, furniture, and medicinal materials, which have not been distributed to this day.
    After reading the People's Daily, I understood the democratic government's policy of protecting industry and commerce and correcting deviations. Therefore, I found Director Zhang of the Second District of Wei County and, according to the law, requested a refund. Director Zhang repeatedly wrote to Jiacun Village to instruct them to return it, but the village always ignored it.
    This year, each village in Wei County has a resident work team. My father and son repeatedly wrote to the work team and negotiated in person, but the work team refused to take responsibility. Months have passed, and it has all been in vain.
    Comrade Editor, how should this problem be handled? Please give a clear reply and send a letter to the Wei County Government instructing the work team to handle it quickly.

    Answer: Regarding the problem of your pharmacy in Jiacun Village, Second District, Wei County, being confiscated by the village, according to the Central Bureau of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Bureau of the Communist Party of China's instructions on industrial and commercial policies: "All industries and businesses that have been struggled against and liquidated, which have not yet been distributed, or converted into mass shares, or even if they have been distributed but have not yet been damaged or exhausted, should be returned to the original owners immediately and unconditionally." According to this principle, since your pharmacy has not yet been distributed, Jiacun Village should return it all immediately. The irresponsible attitude taken by the village cadres and the work team is incorrect. It is hoped that the Wei County County Committee will quickly inspect and handle this.

### 于朝宗的药铺应立即退还　请魏县县委会检查处理

　　于朝宗的药铺应立即退还　请魏县县委会检查处理
    编辑同志：
    我在七七事变前，有地百亩，人十三四口，长子是共产党员，因参加抗战，被敌伪迫害，举家流亡外乡，乞讨度日，次子于培节衣缩食在魏县二区夹町村开设一小药铺，经七八年辛苦经营，到日寇投降时，已稍具规模，而夹町村村干，不明了工商政策，无理摊派，加重负担，那时候我因家乡已获解放，准备将药铺搬回原籍安心经营，只因家中房舍不便，迁移迟慢，被夹町村村干将药橱家具和药材全部没收，至今尚未分配。
    我阅读人民日报后，了解民主政府保护工商业之政策，并进行纠偏，遂找魏县二区张区长，根据法令，请求退还，张区长给夹町村一再去信指示退还，该村始终没有理会。
    今年魏县各村都有了住村工作组，我父子二人给工作组一再去信，并当面交涉，又谁知工作组不肯负责，迄今数月之久，终属徒然。
    编辑同志，对于此一问题究应如何处理，请明白答复，并去信魏县县政府，指示工作组，迅速处理为盼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　成磁七区李家町于朝宗
    答：你在魏县二区夹町村开设的药铺，被该村没收的问题，根据中共晋冀鲁豫中央局对工商业政策指示：“凡被斗争清算之工商业，尚未分配，或转作群众股份，或虽已分配而尚未损坏耗光者，均应立即无条件退还原业主”。根据这一原则，你的药铺既然尚未分配，夹町村应立即全部退还。村干与工作组采取不负责任的态度是不对的，希望魏县县委会迅速检查处理。
