    [Reported by this newspaper] With the growing development of industry and commerce in various parts of North China, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee have issued an order to abolish the monopolistic trading privileges of market exchanges in order to facilitate transactions for merchants and guarantee free trade within the interior. The original text is as follows: During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to carry out the struggle against the enemy, stabilize prices, and punish speculative and manipulative acts by unscrupulous merchants, market exchanges were set up in many larger markets, prohibiting private individuals from opening firms and stipulating that all large-scale transactions must be conducted through the exchanges. This played a certain role in the struggle against the enemy and in stabilizing prices. Now, due to the increasing consolidation and expansion of the Liberated Areas, the increasing development of industry and commerce, and the gradual stabilization of prices, the monopolistic trading privileges of the market exchanges in the past must be abolished in order to facilitate transactions for merchants and guarantee free trade within the interior. For this purpose, the following provisions are hereby made:
    1.  From the date of this order, all markets in the entire region shall be allowed to conduct transactions freely, and no exchange, private firm, or broker (Yaji) shall impose any restrictions.
    2.  Private individuals are permitted to establish firms.
    3.  Larger markets should organize market management committees to manage the market, manage brokers, mediate disputes, and collect transaction fees. The committees should be organized by the local government or industrial and commercial management organs with the participation of legitimate merchants, and be under the leadership of the government's industrial and commercial departments. Market brokers (Yaji) must register with the management committee and be issued permits before they can introduce transactions.
    4.  Transaction fees shall be collected according to law for all transactions handled through market brokers, public or private firms (temporarily implemented according to past regulations, and will be uniformly promulgated soon). No fees shall be collected for transactions conducted independently without the involvement of brokers or firms.

    晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀行政委员会通令
    保障内地贸易自由
    取消交易所统制权
    【本报讯】华北各地工商业日趋发展，为便利商民成交，保障内地贸易自由，晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀边区行政委员会顷特通令取消集市交易所统制交易特权，原文如下：在抗日战争时期，为了进行对敌斗争，稳定物价，制裁奸商投机操纵行为，在许多较大的集市上，曾经设置集市交易所，禁止私人开设行栈，规定一切大宗交易，都必须经过交易所成交，在对敌斗争与稳定物价上，曾起过一定的作用。现在由于解放区日益巩固扩大，工商业日益发展，物价日趋稳定，为了便利商民成交，保障内地贸易自由，过去集市交易所统制交易之特权，必须加以取消。为此特作以下之规定：一、自通令之日起，全区所有集市一律准许自由成交，任何交易所、私人行栈及交易员（牙纪）均不得加以限制。二、准许私人设立行栈。三、较大的集市应组织集市管理委员会，办理管理集市管理牙纪，调解纠纷，征收交易手续费等工作，由集市所在地政府或工商管理机关聘请正当商人参加组织之，受政府工商部门领导，集市交易员（牙纪）必须向管理委员会登记，发给证照，始得介绍成交。四、凡通过集市交易员、公私行栈办理成交者，依法征收交易手续费（暂按过去规定执行，不久即统一颁布），不通过交易员及行栈自行成交者，概不征收。
