(Taihang Electricity) Before the "July 7th" Incident, Taigu was the first commercial city in central Shanxi. In the past ten years, it has been devastated by Japanese invaders and Yan Bandit. Luo Fengwei, Chairman of the Taigu Chamber of Commerce, denounced Yan Bandit's destruction of Taigu's commerce, saying: Since Yan Bandit took over the Japanese invaders' rule, until 1947, the number of large commercial firms has decreased to eleven, and the number of small and medium-sized commercial firms has decreased to 263. Last July, merchants were apportioned 8,400 shi of wheat. Top-tier merchants, such as Guang Sheng Yuan, had to pay 11 shi of wheat per month per household; medium-tier merchants had to pay 3 shi and 5 dou per month per household; and small merchants, such as vendors, also had to pay 3 dou 5 sheng to 1 shi 5 dou per month per household. He said: The Wan Ju Heng business of the famous Taigu rich merchant Ma Baiwan had already been devastated by the Japanese invaders and had ceased operations for several years; last April, Yan Bandit apportioned them 110 shi of wheat. Because they could not pay, his son was detained for three days, and the whole family finally fled. After July, they were assigned another six months of grain payments, to be completed within seven days. Businesses were forced to request to suspend operations and close down, willing to offer all their capital and bottom money to offset the grain; however, Yan Bandit officials ordered that three years' worth of payments be paid in full before allowing them to close down. Two photography studios that were just preparing to open were immediately assigned 1 shi and 4 dou of wheat. Feng Shouli had already been ordered and permitted to suspend operations on August 30th last year, and the procedures had long been completed, and the rotten furniture had been completely auctioned off, but in October they were asked to pay old grain again. Five silver firms, including Baochang, Zhengxinyu, and Huiyuan, which had been operating for decades, were apportioned more than 400 shi of wheat and were forced to close down because they could not afford to pay. In five months, 130 households in the city, including Pujin Bank, successively went bankrupt, and as many as 10 households abandoned their shops and stocks and fled. Afterwards, Yan Bandit also reprimanded the Chamber of Commerce for not grasping the psychology of the merchants, and added the payments owed by the fleeing merchants to other remaining businesses. In addition, there were extortion schemes such as "Respect the Army and Offer Meat" and "Mutual Aid Grain," which stipulated that each slaughterhouse must hand in 400 catties of meat to the Civil Affairs Section every month, regardless of how much pork they sold. As a result, six of the thirteen slaughterhouses ran away. Yan Bandit demolished many commercial and residential buildings when repairing blockhouses, averaging the housing prices on others, calling it "Mutual Aid Grain." He said: When the merchants and residents of Taigu City recall this painful history, everyone always hopes to defeat Taiyuan and eliminate Yan Xishan as soon as possible, so that their commerce can move towards prosperity more quickly.

　　阎匪勒索花样多
  　许多商号关了门
  　太谷商会长控诉
    【太行电】“七七”事变前，太谷是晋中的第一个商业城市，十年来已被日寇和阎匪摧残得不成样子了。太谷商会理事长罗凤维痛斥阎匪摧残太谷商业的情况称：自阎匪接收日寇统治后，到民国三十六年，大商行减至十一家，中小商号减至二百六十三户。去年七月份摊派商家小麦八千四百石，上等商号如广升远，每户每月须摊派小麦十一石，中等商号每户每月摊三石五斗，小商号，如摊贩等每户每月亦需三斗五升至一石五斗。他说：太谷著名富商马百万的商号万聚恒，早已被日寇摧残殆尽，停业数年；去年四月阎匪又给派了小麦一百一十石，因无法交纳，曾将他儿子扣了三天，最后全家潜逃。七月份以后，再派半年粮款限七天完成，商号被迫纷纷请求歇业关门，愿将全部资本与铺底完全拿出顶粮；但阎匪官府申令出够三年款项始许停业。两个照像馆刚在筹备尚未营业，即派给小麦一石四斗。冯守礼去年八月三十日已奉命许可歇业，手续早已办清，烂家具已全部拍卖，但十月份又向他催要旧粮。已经经营数十年之久的保昌、正心裕、会元等五家银号，被摊派小麦四百余石、因无力缴纳，被迫停业。五个月时间，城内即有溥晋银行等一百三十余户相继倒闭，全部扔掉铺面及存货逃亡者达十户之多。事后阎匪还申斥商会没有把握住商人的心理，并将逃亡商户应交款项加派给其他残留商号。此外尚有“尊军献肉”与“互助粮”之勒索花样，规定每个杀坊每月不管卖多少猪肉，净交民政科四百斤肉，结果十三座杀坊就跑了六家。阎匪修炮楼拆掉商号民房很多，把房价平均在别人身上，名之曰“互助粮”，他说：当太谷城商民忆起这一段痛苦的历史时，大家总是渴望早日打到太原消灭阎锡山，使自己的商业更快走向繁荣。
