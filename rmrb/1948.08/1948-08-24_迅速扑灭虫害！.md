　　Quickly Eradicate Insect Pests!
    It is reported that insect plagues have been discovered successively in nearly sixty counties in the Jinan, Jizhong, and Jixi regions of Hebei, and are developing seriously. Among them, armyworms, locusts, and grub worms are the most harmful. In villages that have been severely affected, up to 70% of the crops have been eaten. In Jixian County, Southern Hebei, the affected area has expanded to half of the villages in the county. This disaster must be given our full attention.
    Our region has suffered successive disasters this year, including wind, hail, drought, and other calamities. Just as the floods have subsided, we are now facing a serious insect plague. The crops that the masses have worked hard on for months, and whose harvest is in sight, are about to be damaged again. This is a serious threat to the masses. The Jizhong Administrative Office and the North Yue Fifth Prefectural Committee have promptly issued emergency instructions, calling on cadres at all levels to concentrate all their efforts and lead the masses to capture and kill the pests. This is very necessary. It is hoped that the disaster-stricken areas will earnestly implement these instructions. Any hesitation or waiting will cause serious losses. As long as we are not negligent and can mobilize the masses to fight against the insect pests, and quickly and fully capture and kill them, the insect plague can be eradicated, and it certainly can be eradicated. Just as we fight against drought and floods, our people in North China have experience in fighting against insect pests. It is hoped that all localities will carry forward their existing experience, and educate the masses with facts anytime and anywhere, break down paralysis, superstition, and other erroneous ideas, take prompt action, and strengthen the unified action and unified leadership between counties, districts, and villages. By concentrating forces in a planned and organized manner to carry out eradication, we can certainly victoriously complete the serious task of eliminating insects and rescuing the autumn grain.

　　迅速扑灭虫害！
    据悉冀南冀中冀西几达六十余县地区先后发现虫灾，且正严重发展，其中黏虫蝗虫肉虫为害最凶，受害较重村庄，青苗被吃达百分之七十；南冀冀县受灾面积已扩及全县二分之一的村庄。这一灾情，必须引起我们足够的注意。
    我区今年连遭风雹苦旱等灾害，水患刚过，现又遭严重虫灾，群众勤劳数月，眼看收获在望的粮食，又要受到损害，这对群众是个严重威胁。冀中行署及北岳五地委已及时发出紧急指示，号召各级干部集中全力，领导群众捕打，这是非常必要的。希望受灾地区，切实执行，一切观望等待，都将造成严重损失。只要我们不疏忽，能把群众动员起来给虫害作斗争，迅速全力捕打，虫灾是可以扑灭，而且一定能够扑灭的。正如与旱灾水患作斗争一样，我们华北人民与虫患作斗争也是有经验的，希望各地发扬已有经验，随时随地用事实教育群众，打破麻痹、迷信等错误思想，迅速行动起来，并加强县区村间的统一行动统一领导，有计划有组织的集中力量进行扑灭，一定可以胜利完成灭虫抢救秋粮的严重任务。
