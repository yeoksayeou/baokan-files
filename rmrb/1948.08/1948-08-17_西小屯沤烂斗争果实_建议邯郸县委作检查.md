　　Rotten Struggle Fruits in Xixiaotun
  　Suggest the Handan County Committee Conduct an Inspection
    Recently, due to cloudy and rainy weather, I discovered at the Xixiaotun Village Office in the Third District of Handan that over 200 jin of cotton and over 30 pieces of clothing, the fruits of last year's struggle, have recently rotted. It is said that these were the fruits of the struggle during last year's re-examination. Some say they were wrongly struggled against, and no one dared to return or distribute them. The cadres also did not care, so they rotted. This is all a loss to the people. In this village, there are nine mules, beds, and carts that have not been distributed. Most of them are used and fed by the cadres, which makes the poor farmers dissatisfied. Village cadres say: This is because the land outline has not yet been implemented and they have not been divided. It is suggested that the county committee organs conduct an inspection to reduce losses to the people.

    Editor's note: Comrade Wang Juzheng's suggestion is very important. It is suggested that the Handan County Committee immediately conduct an in-depth inspection, and other places should also inspect similar matters, "to reduce losses to the people."

　　西小屯沤烂斗争果实
  　建议邯郸县委作检查
    近来天阴下雨，我在邯郸三区西小屯村公所发现去年的斗争果实有棉花二百多斤，衣服三十多件，最近已经沤烂。据说是去年复查时的斗争果实，有人说是斗错的，不敢退也不敢分，干部也不管，所以沤烂。这都是人民的损失。该村有骡子九条、床、大车都没有分，大部都是干部使喂，贫苦农民不满意。村干部谈：这是因为土地的大纲下来未分。建议县委机关作一检查，使人民少受点损失。

    编者按：王居正同志提的这个意见很重要，建议邯郸县委立即加以深入检查，其他地方也应检查类似事情，“使人民少受点损失”。
