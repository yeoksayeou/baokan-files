　　“One Person Suffers, All Support”
  　Students in the Chiang Area Unite to Oppose Persecution
    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 16th] Students remaining on campuses in Peiping, Tianjin, and Nanjing during the summer vacation are united in resisting the persecution by the Kuomintang ruling clique. According to reports in Peiping and Tianjin newspapers, the Kuomintang authorities are taking advantage of the summer vacation student dispersal to indiscriminately arrest and persecute students in various places. In July, eight more students were arrested in Peiping, namely Li Junlin, a freshman in the Department of Law at Chaoyang University (arrested on the 5th); Zhao Jiadong, in the Department of Civil Engineering at Northeastern University (9th); Xu Fangwei from Tsinghua University; Ding Zhi from Chaoyang University; a certain Xu from the Teachers College (13th); Wang Li, a freshman in the Department of Physics and Chemistry at Changbai Teachers College (19th); Zhao Shuying from the Department of Education at the Teachers College, and Zhou Zhengxi from the Department of Biology (date of arrest unknown). Among them, Xu Fangwei, Ding Zhi, and Wang Li have been sent to the fascist Peiping "Special Criminal Court." Under the Kuomintang’s insane persecution, students from Tsinghua, Teachers College, Chaoyang, and other schools have established rescue committees to conduct petitioning, accusations, and collective prison visits. The "Joint Support Association for the July 5th Massacre of Students in North China and Northeast China" sent a letter to the enemy's Peiping Garrison Headquarters on July 18, demanding the release of all arrested students; otherwise, they would take collective imprisonment action, preparing to practice the sacred oath of "one person suffers, all support." Universities and colleges in North China and Northeast China have also launched a collective imprisonment signing movement. After Beiyang University in Tianjin was searched by military police on the morning of the 18th, students from Beiyang, Nankai, Jiguang, and Hebei Women's Normal College jointly protested to the Tianjin Enemy Garrison Headquarters, demanding guarantees that similar atrocities would not occur in the future. After Hua Binqing (Department of Political Science), Li Chengxue (Department of Law), and Li Biao (Department of Electrical Engineering) from Nanjing Central University were arrested on July 6, the school's student union immediately issued an announcement and formed a rescue committee to carry out the rescue. All students in the preparatory class of Henan University, which moved to Suzhou, issued a declaration in mid-July, opposing the Kuomintang Ministry of Education's forcing them to attend fascist training in summer camps.
