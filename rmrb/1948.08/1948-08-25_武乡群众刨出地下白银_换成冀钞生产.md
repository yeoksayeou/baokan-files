(Taihang Electric) Following the thorough land reform in Wuxiang, the masses, with an increased understanding of our Party's policy of developing production, have been digging up silver and silver dollars buried underground and exchanging them at the bank for Jicha (currency of the Shanxi-Hebei-Henan Border Region) to use as capital for expanding production. During the land reform in the county, there was a "struggle against the rich" that was leftist in nature. Some honest farmers did not dare to take out and use the silver dollars and silver that they had saved before the War of Resistance. As a result, this batch of usable funds became dead assets. After correcting the policy, everyone saw that the middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against had been compensated, and the landlords and rich peasants who had been swept out of their homes had also been resettled. The government also instructed all localities that anyone with silver dollars or silver could go directly to the local bank to exchange them for Jicha at the prescribed price without any formalities or proof. The masses have a greater understanding of our Party's policies and have been actively exchanging. At the Wuxiang branch of the Jinnan Bank alone, 720 silver dollars, 47 taels of silver, and 178 taels of unrefined silver were exchanged in July. People continue to come in an endless stream to exchange currency.

    武乡群众刨出地下白银
    换成冀钞生产
    【太行电】武乡土改已经彻底，群众进一步了解我党发展生产的政策后，纷纷把埋在地下的白银、银元刨出，到银行兑换冀钞，作为扩大生产的资本。该县土改中曾发生过“斗富”的左倾错误，一些老实农民在抗战前所节俭储存的银元、白银都不敢取出动用，这一批能够利用的资金结果变成了死物。经过端正政策后，大家看到过去错斗的中农补偿了，扫地出门的地主富农也安置了，政府又指示各地，无论何人凡存有银元白银者，可不用任何手续和证明，均可直接到当地银行按规定价格兑换冀钞。群众对我党政策更加了解，纷纷兑换，只冀南银行武乡支行一处，七月份一个月内就兑换了现洋七百二十元，白银四十七两，色银一百七十八两，现前往继续兑换者仍络绎不绝。
