Farmers' Urgent Demands After Land Reform: Consolidate Land Rights, Develop Production – A Record of an Investigation of Fifteen Farmers in Mixiye, Pingshan – Production is Unorganized and Left to Drift – Hope for Leadership from Above

[This Newspaper] News: In Mixiye Village, Pingshan's Second District, this reporter interviewed seven poor and landless peasants (Yan Chouzi, Yan Shangou, Zhao Jinshuan, Mi Ershun, Mi Xizhao, Yan Xinshun, Yan Gouni), two middle peasants (Mi Shibao, Mi Yongqing), three middle peasants whose land was taken away (Mi Xifang, Qing Rui, Song Fushun), and three well-to-do middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against (Song Laiquan, Mi Yuanxiang, Song Guilin). Their reflections represent fairly well the demands and hopes of people from all social strata in the village (the village has no landlords or rich peasants). In summary, they have three major demands:

I. Production is Unorganized and Left to Drift, Hope for Leadership from Above. This village was liberated in 1944, but a large-scale, well-led, and organized production campaign like those in the old liberated areas has not been well carried out. Former branch secretary and well-to-do middle peasant Song Laiquan said, "In the past, higher authorities came to organize, but they only formed groups on paper, and it didn't work." The masses have no experience in organizing, but today they have a demand for organization. Poor peasant Zhao Jinshuan said, "Work exchange is good, two people can do the work of three." There is now also some work exchange in the village, but this is mostly between those with labor power. Those without labor power rarely participate. In the spring, the work team held meetings and talked about "large-scale production" and "work exchange groups," but only talked about it without organizing. The work team left after a few months. Until now, no one has come to the village to supervise and promote production. It is said that someone from the city is coming to launch a production blitz recently, but they haven't arrived in this village yet. The higher-ups only talk about it but don't actually do anything. In the village, production is said to be led by the Poor Peasants' Association, the New Peasants' Association, and the village director, but in reality, no one is in charge (this multiple leadership either pits the Poor Peasants' Association against the New Peasants' Association, or no one is in charge. Today, production should only be led by the New Peasants' Association, and the Poor Peasants' Association should be abolished – Editor). The production committee member is also just a figurehead. Since spring, he has not held a meeting or done any work. He doesn't even know if he is a township production committee member or a village production committee member. When the reporter talked to him about leading production, he said, "The people in our village are very good at production. They don't need leadership, they can all produce." (This is completely an abolitionist viewpoint that cancels leadership – Editor). Last year, the year was bad, and the whole village survived the famine by spinning and weaving. This year, the rain came late. According to them, "Even if it rains, it will be a bad year. The dry land is completely dried up, and some of the paddy fields have been flooded. Houses have collapsed and there has been considerable damage." When asked about how to survive the famine this year, they said, "Last year, weaving a bolt of cloth could earn five or six sheng of grain, but this year, weaving a bolt of cloth can only earn two sheng of grain. Weaving cloth is not worth it." "What do you do if weaving cloth is not worth it?" "There's no way! After eating the grain, we eat tree leaves and suffer a little." "We hope the higher authorities can think of more ways for us." "It would be much better if the higher authorities came to the village frequently to supervise production!" This is their inner demand—hope that the higher authorities will strengthen production leadership.

II. Revise the class designations, issue land certificates, and people will be at ease. The village originally had no landlords or rich peasants. Last year, under the influence of "leftist" thinking, the work team mistakenly classified eight households as rich peasants. Later, seven households were changed to well-to-do middle peasants. In order to "allow poor and landless peasants to turn over," the well-to-do middle peasants were labeled with the phrase "engaging in exploitation," and their "floating wealth" was confiscated. This "floating wealth" has been untouched except for eight shi of grain that was lent out. Everyone is very concerned about this issue. Poor Peasants' Association cadre Mi Xizhao said, "Let the Party branch handle it, clean it up, return what should be returned, distribute what should be distributed. We have no objection whether it is returned or distributed, just don't delay any longer." Poor Peasants' Association leader Yan Gouni said, "Hurry up and deal with it, the ox of Zhu Yinlu (well-to-do middle peasant) was taken away and is being fed by four poor peasants. If a decision is not made soon, the ox will soon be fed to death." Song Laiquan, who is currently wearing the hat of a rich peasant but is actually a well-to-do middle peasant, said, "I am asked to take on work (currently serving as a township government secretary), but my rich peasant hat has not been removed. Whether I am or not, I hope it will be clarified soon." Middle peasant Song Fushun said, "It should be clarified clearly."

"Will the land be moved again?" This is what the peasants are most concerned about. Everyone has also heard the higher authorities say, "This time the land is distributed, it will not be distributed again," but deep down, they don't quite believe it. Poor peasant Mi Ershun said, "People are saying all sorts of things. Some say that Lao Liu (from the work team) went to the county for training and will review the land distribution again in August or September. Some say that even if you take someone else's land, you will have to return it to them." Well-to-do middle peasant Song Qingrui said, "Some people say there will be nine reviews, I don't know if it's true or not! I think it's better to eat well and live well!" Some people are deliberately spreading strange talk on the streets: "Eat today, don't worry about tomorrow!" Poor peasant Mi Xizhao said that people can focus on production once they are at ease, but he also asked, "Will the land be redistributed after all?" Therefore, everyone hopes to issue land certificates quickly. It is said that the district sent a letter in the past asking people to collect land certificates, but because the land could not be determined, no one dared to collect them. Well-to-do middle peasant Song Guilin said, "Once the land certificates are issued, the middle peasants will be at ease." Poor peasant Yan Shangou said, "With the documents, the poor peasants will have something concrete to hold on to." "Once the bright red documents are issued, everyone will be at ease."

III. The Party rectification work has not been completed and must continue. Last year, during the Party rectification in the village, the masses were only mobilized to raise opinions about the Party members. After the opinions were raised, the rights and wrongs were not clarified, and appropriate measures were not taken. The ideological problems of the Party members have not been resolved. Some Party members believe that the Party rectification was wrong and are still in a bad mood, not serving as cadres, and not working. After the Party rectification, the work of the Party branch completely stopped. Since May this year, neither the branch committee meetings, the group meetings, nor the Party member meetings have been held, and Party dues have not been paid. Party member Mi Lailiao doesn't know who the branch secretary is, and branch secretary Yan Erlai doesn't know who the group leader is. Some Party members said, "I don't even know if there is still a Party." Many Party members and the masses urgently hope for Party rectification. Song Zixiang (middle peasant) said, "It's good to rectify the Party, if it's not rectified, it's like it's been disbanded." Poor peasant Yan Chouzi (a member of the masses) said, "There is still a small knot between the Party members and the masses. It would be good to rectify the Party." This is a reflection of the problems left over from the Party rectification work, and it also reflects the masses' concern for the Party. It is worth studying and considering by the leadership and should be resolved satisfactorily. (Liu Shan)

    土改后农民的迫切要求
    巩固地权发展生产
    平山米西冶十五个农民调查纪实
    生产自流无组织
    希望上级来领导
    【本报讯】在平山二区米西冶村，记者调查访问了七个贫雇农（阎丑子、阎山狗、赵金拴、米二顺、米喜赵、阎心顺、阎狗妮），两个中农（米屎包、米永庆），三个中农抽地户（米喜芳、清瑞、宋富顺），三个富裕中农错斗户（宋来全、米元祥、宋桂林）。他们的反映相当的代表了该村各阶层人民的要求和希望（该村无地主富农），综合起来他们有三大要求：
    一、生产自流无组织，希望上级来领导。这个村是一九四四年解放的，没有很好的开展过象老区那样的领导有组织的大生产运动。前支书富裕中农宋来全说：“往常年上级来组织过，光编一下组，形式上有了，也不起作用”。群众对组织起来没经验，但今天却有组织起来的要求，贫农赵金拴说：“拨工好，两个人能作三个人的营生。”现在村中也有换工的，这种换工大都是有劳力的和有劳力的换工，没劳力的很少参加。春天工作组开会讲过“大生产”、“拨工组”，只讲了一下没有组织。几月工作组走了。直到现在没有人来村督促抓生产，听说最近城里有人要来突击生产，还没到这村，上边光说嘴不实干。村中说起来是由贫农团、新农会、村主任领导生产的，实际上谁也不管（这种多的领导不是贫农团与新农会对立，便是谁也不管，今天生产只能由新农会去领导，贫农团应取销其名义，加入到新农会去——编者）。生产委员也是挂名的，自春天到现在没开过会，也没有作过工作。他连自己是乡生产委员还是村生产委员也闹不清。记者和他一谈领导生产，他便说：“俺村人们生产可强哩，用不着领导都会生产。”（这完全是一种取消领导的取消观点——编者）去年年景不好，全村人靠纺织渡过了灾荒，今年下雨下的迟，据他们说：“下了雨也是荒年。旱地旱了个死，水地有的被冲，房倒屋塌遭害不小。”谈到今年怎样渡荒时，他们说：“去年织一匹布能挣五六升粮食，今年织一匹布只能挣二升粮食，织布不沾。”“织布不沾怎么办呢？”“没办法！吃完粮食吃树叶，受点罪过。”“希望上级给俺们多想办法。”“上级勤到村里督促生产可强多哩！”这是他们心中的要求——希望上级加强生产领导。
    二、改订好成份分发下土地证，人们就安心了。该村本没有地主富农，去年工作组在左倾思想支配下，开始错误的划了八户富农。后来有七户改成富裕中农。为了“要贫雇农翻身”，把富裕中农加了“挂剥削”三字，征收了一个浮财。这些“浮财”到现在除八石粮借出外，都还放着没动，对这个问题大家很关心。贫农团干部米喜赵说：“把党级处理一下，搞好清洁，东西该退的退，该分的分，是退是分俺们都没意见，不要再迟延了。”贫农团长阎狗妮说：“赶紧处理一下吧，割了人家朱银禄（富裕中农）家的牛，四个贫农喂着，再不决定，牛便快喂死了。”本是富裕中农，目前还戴着富农帽子的宋来全说：“叫我担任工作（现任乡政府秘书），富农帽子还没摘哩，无论是不是，希望早点弄明白。”中农宋富顺说：“可该往清楚的闹了。”
    “土地还动不动？”这是农民最关心的事。大家也听到过上级讲：“这次地分好，即不再分了”，但心眼里老有点不相信。贫农米二顺说：“老百姓说什么的也有，有的说老刘（工作组的）去县上受训了，八、九月里又复查呀。有的说接了人家的地也白接，还得给人家退哩。”富裕中农宋清瑞说：“有人说复查九回哩，也不知是真是假！我看以后作强点吃好点！”也有的故意在街上讲怪话：“今天有今天吃，吃了上顿不管下顿！”贫农米喜赵嘴里说人们生产好安心，但他又问：“土地到底还推平不？”因此大伙都希望赶快发土地证。据说过去区里来信叫去领土地证，因为土地确定不了，谁也不敢领。富裕中农宋桂林说：“发了土地证，中农们便放心了。”贫农阎山狗说：“有了文书，贫农便有了硬把子了。”“红橙橙的文书一发，大家便安心了。”
    三、整党工作没有完成，还得继续进行。去年该村整党时只是发动群众向党员提意见，提出后没有弄清是非，适当处理。党员的思想问题还没解决，有的党员认为整党整错了，到现在还闹情绪，不当干部，不工作。整党后支部工作完全停顿，自从今年五月到现在，支委会、小组会、党员会均未开过，也没缴党费。党员米来了不知谁是支书，支书阎二来不知谁是支组。有的党员说：“也不知现在还有党没有？”许多党员群众迫切希望整党，宋子祥（中农）说：“整整党好，不整就和解散了一样。”贫农阎丑子（群众）说：“党员和群众还有个小疙瘩，整整党就好了。”这是整党工作还遗留有问题的反映，也反映了群众对党的关心，值得领导上研究考虑，予以圆满解决。（刘山）
