　　Overview of the Three Years in Northeast China

　　(1) On the Eve of Liberating the Entire Northeast

　　Over the past three years, the Northeast People's Liberation War has achieved great victories, and the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves has undergone fundamental changes. The Northeast People's Liberation Army has evolved from taking an offensive defense against the enemy to a full-scale offensive, while the Kuomintang army has changed from a large-scale offensive to defense, and is now trapped in a few isolated cities, facing the fate of being completely annihilated. Now, in the entire Northeast (including the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region), with more than 1.5 million square kilometers of land, our army occupies more than 97% of the area. The areas of East, West, South, North Manchuria, and the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region have all been connected into one, while the Kuomintang army only has isolated strongholds such as Shenyang, Changchun, Jinzhou, and Chengde left. Of the 264 cities in the entire Northeast (including the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region), our army holds 230 (including newly established county seats and banners), while the enemy army is divided, isolated, and trapped in 34 large and small cities. Of the more than 50 million people in the entire Northeast (including the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region), more than 42 million are in our area, and more than 7 million are in the enemy area.

　　The war situation in the Northeast over the past three years can be divided into three periods: The first period lasted from October 1945, when the Kuomintang army attacked Shanhaiguan, to December 1946. During this period, the enemy concentrated superior forces to occupy the Changchun-Shenyang section of the Chinese Changchun Railway, as well as the cities along and near the Beining, Chengjin, Jishen, Pingmei, Meiji, Anshen, and Datong railways. Our army adopted an offensive defense against the enemy, with the aim of weakening and eliminating the enemy's effective strength and maintaining and developing our own. In the operations during this period, a total of more than 60,000 enemies were annihilated, and the glorious uprising of Pan Shuoduan and others from the KMT's 184th Division was won. During this period, the enemy's combat effectiveness generally suffered losses, forcing them to shift from concentration to dispersion. In the rear of the liberated areas, we wiped out nearly 100,000 Kuomintang bandits and "underground central army" in large numbers. Bandit leaders Li Huatang, Xie Wendong, Wang Naikang, Cao Xingwu, Jiang Pengfei, and others were captured alive and executed. The second period lasted from January 1947 to April. The Northeast Chiang bandits adopted the strategy of defending in the north and attacking in the south, using their mobile forces to repeatedly invade our small area around Linjiang four times. Our army in South Manchuria fought bravely and defended Linjiang four times; our army in North Manchuria went down to Jiangnan three times, threatening Ji (Lin) Chang (Chun), causing the Kuomintang army to lose sight of both ends, and its strategy of attacking in the south and defending in the north completely failed. During this period, our army annihilated more than 69,000 enemies and recovered 11 cities, basically stopping the enemy's strategic offensive in the Northeast and forcing them to turn to defense. The third period lasted from May of last year to the present. Our army turned to a full-scale offensive, forcing the enemy into a defensive, divided, and isolated state. Among them, during the summer offensive last year, which lasted for more than 50 days, a total of more than 89,000 enemies were annihilated and 42 cities were recovered, connecting East, West, South, and North Manchuria into one, and driving away Du Yuming. In mid-September last year, the autumn offensive was launched, giving the Chiang bandits reinforcements coming from inside the pass a devastating blow, cutting off the Beining Line, and cutting off the Changchun-Shenyang section of the Chinese Changchun Railway again, making Changchun and Jilin completely isolated and the enemy completely in a passive and beaten position. During the autumn offensive, which lasted for more than 50 days, a total of more than 69,000 enemies were annihilated, and 15 cities were recovered. In December, the winter offensive was launched. At that time, our army braved the extreme cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius and carried out a series of fortress attacks, capturing Zhangwu, Xinlitun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Siping and other towns with solid fortifications built by the Chiang bandits, and annihilating all the enemy troops stationed in these areas. Bandit leader Chen Cheng stepped down due to the disastrous defeat and was replaced by Wei Lihuang. On February 25th this year, when our army launched an attack on Yingkou, it also won the uprising of the 58th Provisional Division of the defending army. Fearing our army's ability to attack fortresses, the enemy dared not hold on to Jilin City, which was guarded by an army and had permanent fortifications. The 60th Army of the Jilin garrison escaped to Changchun, and we liberated Jilin. In the three months of the winter offensive, a total of more than 150,000 enemies were annihilated and 16 cities were recovered. From early to late May this year, our army in the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region launched an offensive, annihilating more than 7,000 enemies in 20 days and capturing 5 cities. The entire Rehe Province, except for Chengde, was liberated.

　　Over the past three years, the Northeast our army has annihilated a total of more than 440,000 enemies (this is only calculated according to the various battles and larger battles, and the number of enemies annihilated in other smaller or sporadic battles is not included, and the number of enemies annihilated by our army in the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region before the summer offensive last year is also not included). In addition, more than 100,000 Kuomintang bandits and others were annihilated.

　　Through land reform and production movements, the broad masses of the people have supported the Liberation War in all aspects. The enthusiasm and scale of direct participation in the army and the war have also increased with the development of the war. Last autumn, on this basis, the rear military regions of our army established second-line corps with more than 100,000 people, which were sent to the front line this spring after new-style rectification and training, and then established an even stronger second-phase second-line corps. And the labor force participating in the war went to the front line in an organized manner as needed by the war.

　　(2) The countryside takes on a new look after land reform

　　Simultaneous with the continuous victories of the Liberation War on the front lines, the rear base areas have achieved a great victory in land reform. The entire land reform movement has gone through four stages: The first stage, from July to November 1946, was the period of liquidation and land distribution. At that time, 12,000 cadres were sent to organize work teams to go to the countryside to find poor peasants, farm laborers, and active elements of middle peasants, first hold small meetings, and after complaining and brewing, launched a universal struggle to give the largest traitors, local tyrants, landlords, and bandit leaders in the countryside at that time an initial blow. However, the powerful and cunning feudal forces, on the one hand, openly resisted and sabotaged by bandits or other methods, and on the other hand, took false struggles, false farmers' associations, false land distribution, threats, and buying over backward elements to escape land reform; in addition, due to the limitations of our subjective and objective conditions, the land reform work at that time generally existed in a "half-cooked rice" state. The second stage, from December 1946 to June last year, was the period of "cooking half-cooked rice": The struggle in this period was deeper and more meticulous, mobilizing the masses village by village, checking the previous work, further destroying the large feudal fortresses that had not been defeated, and carrying out the work of purifying the revolutionary ranks from them, identifying the lackeys sent by the feudal enemies in the past and some opportunists one by one, so that the land reform achieved further victory. However, the feudal enemies at this time continued to hide their feudal property and part of the land and guns, in order to rise again, so in order to completely eliminate the enemy, the struggle to cut down big trees and dig up treasures was further carried out. The third stage, from July to November 1947, was the period of cutting and digging movements: On the basis of the work in the first two stages and the great victory of the Liberation Army's summer offensive, the movement developed more violently, and it was more in-depth than the previous period in terms of the scale and depth of the struggle. Black land was found, the hidden guns of the landlords were searched out, and the bottom property was dug up, so that the feudal forces suffered more serious blows in more places, and the peasants further took power and became masters. The fourth stage, from December 1947 to February this year, was the period of equal land distribution movement: On the basis of the previous stage, the existing problem was that part of the feudal forces had not been eliminated, and the land distribution was still unfair, and it was necessary to redistribute or adjust according to the Outline Land Law, so since December last year, the equal land distribution movement was launched again, and the feudal forces that had not been completely eliminated before were completely eliminated, and the land that had not been distributed well before was redistributed or adjusted, so that the land reform work was basically completed.

　　In the process of land reform, although the achievements are the main ones, some mistakes have also been made due to various specific reasons. For example, in the period of liquidation, land distribution, and re-cooking half-cooked rice, the understanding of the complete elimination of feudal forces was not clear enough, and in some areas, the large and medium landlords had some excessive care (such as retaining too much land), which damaged the interests of the peasants. In the cutting and digging movement and the equal land distribution movement, some "left" errors occurred, such as infringing on industry and commerce, the landlords and rich peasants failed to be dealt with separately, infringing on the interests of some middle peasants, etc. The above errors have been corrected in time.

　　On the basis of the victory of land reform, a new situation unprecedented in the history of the Northeast countryside has emerged. First of all, the extremely unreasonable feudal land system was completely abolished, and replaced by the system of tillers owning their land. In the past, landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for only 10% of the population in the Northeast countryside, monopolized 80% of the land and cruelly exploited the peasants with high rent and low capital; while farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants, who accounted for 80% of the population, only owned 20% of the land. After the land reform, the land and property of the landlords and the surplus land and livestock of the rich peasants have been distributed equally according to the rural population. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Hejiang, and Nenjiang, more than 50 million mu of land, 400,800 cattle and horses, more than 19,500 taels of gold, more than 47,300 catties of silver, and more than 5.2 million pieces of clothing have been confiscated or requisitioned and distributed equally (the above figures, except for the number of mu of land equally distributed, include the entire land reform period, and the rest are statistics from the equal land distribution movement period). In Hejiang Province, after the equal land distribution movement, the peasants received an average of 7 to 12 mu of land per person, and every 40 to 70 mu of land had a head of livestock for use. Most poor farm laborers and farmhands have a head of livestock in each household, and the housing and clothing problems have also been solved. The vast majority of poor farm laborers and farmhands in Heilongjiang Province have a horse, or even two horses, in each household. This has laid the material foundation for the peasants to get rich through labor, and the miserable situation of having no land, no clothes, and no food in the past is gone forever. Therefore, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has surged. According to preliminary statistics from the eight provinces of Northeast China and Harbin City: this year's sowing has exceeded 11.36 million hectares (10 mu per hectare), and nearly 600,000 hectares of wasteland have been opened up. Most of the labor force and livestock in various places have been organized to implement mutual aid and exchange of labor under the principle of voluntary benefit, overcoming this year's severe food shortage and natural disasters, so that the summer hoeing has achieved the requirements of three shovels and three "trips" in a considerable number of areas, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest this year. Secondly, the political tyranny of the landlord class has been swept away, and the new democratic political system has begun to be established. Now all the construction in the countryside—production, political power, education, water conservancy,…—is in the hands of more than 90% of the working people. Farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and other working people serve as members and chairmen of political power, organized by the working people according to the principle of democratic centralism, and the masses are quite accustomed to the democratic life of the meetings. They dare to openly supervise and criticize their own government and their own cadres.

　　(3) Develop urban industry and commerce

　　On the basis of military victory and land reform, a large-scale production and construction movement to restore and develop industry and commerce has been launched in the rear. This work began under extremely difficult circumstances: First of all, it is necessary to overcome the abnormal state of the colonial economy left over from the Japanese puppet era, so that economic construction can serve the support of the war and the improvement of people's lives, so that the city can serve the economic development of the countryside, so as to build a new democratic economy. Secondly, due to the crazy destruction of the Japanese Kou and the Kuomintang after "August 15," the industrial and mining equipment suffered serious losses, and urban industry and commerce fell into decline and stagnation, which aggravated the difficulties of our restoration and construction work. Especially before the summer offensive last year, the Northeast Liberated Areas were divided by the enemy. There were no raw materials where there were machines, and no machines where there were raw materials. In addition, the lack of technical personnel greatly hindered the restoration and development. In order to overcome these difficulties, the policy of relying on workers and mobilizing workers was determined from the beginning, and the results were very good. The Northeast workers not only worked hard and actively participated in the restoration and construction projects, and contributed a large number of valuable equipment, but also used their wisdom to repair many large and complex machines (such as worker Liu Yingyuan's repair of the Harbin generator, etc.), laying the initial foundation for the restoration work. Later, in the widespread production movement, the workers highly demonstrated their labor enthusiasm, making the productivity in many jobs exceed the peak during the puppet Manchu period. Especially since the economic and financial conference last year, under the centralized and unified leadership, various enterprises have gradually begun to move from a decentralized and unplanned production situation to a unified and planned enterprise management, paving the way for a larger-scale development in the future, and laying the foundation for supporting the national victory and building a new Northeast.

　　In terms of mining, coal production has now moved towards a period of mass production. The average daily productivity of each worker has reached 0.5 tons, exceeding 67% during the puppet Manchu period. This year, the four major mining areas in North Manchuria alone can produce 5 million tons of coal. At the same time, the production of coking coal, which is necessary for the development of heavy industry, has also exceeded the planned target (the coal mining area alone has exceeded 176%), and each catty of coking coal produced can melt more than five catties of pig iron. The four major gold mining areas in North Manchuria have completed the original gold collection plan and are working hard to complete the new gold collection plan for this year. In addition, iron ore, copper ore, aluminum ore, etc. have also been partially mined.

　　In terms of industrial production, the military industry has gone from nothing to something, from small to large. The output of some factories after March this year has increased by two to three times compared with December last year. The munitions produced by the factories have timely guaranteed the military supply to the front line. The textile industry in South Manchuria, which was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit army and was on the verge of complete shutdown, has gradually recovered. The state-owned Northeast Third Textile Factory alone spun 796,000 catties of yarn and wove more than 23,400 pieces of cotton cloth in the first three months of this year. The textile industry in North Manchuria has also gone from nothing to something, renovating old ones. Several larger textile factories have produced more than 90,000 bundles of cotton yarn, more than 30,000 pieces of cotton cloth, and more than 60,000 cotton blankets in the first five months of this year. The unique flax textile industry in North Manchuria has also begun to recover. The development of the textile industry has partially solved the difficulty of cloth.

　　The Northeast forestry industry, which accounts for three-quarters of the national forest area, has also gradually moved towards large-scale, unified and planned management. The total number of timber produced this year will reach more than 1.45 million cubic meters.

　　In terms of transportation, posts and telecommunications, the Northeast Liberated Area has 10,750 kilometers of railways, most of which are open to traffic. Only 603 kilometers are now occupied by the enemy, accounting for only 5% of the Northeast railways. The development of the North Manchuria electricity industry has increased the power generation in the first five months of this year by 100% compared with the same period last year, of which 67.7% is used for power. The southern power users in South Manchuria have reached 2,407 households. As for postal and telecommunications, it has now been achieved that the provinces are open to traffic; in the past year, the number of mails alone has increased from 193,37 parts to 1,571,835 pieces.

　　Under the guidance of the CCP's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, and with the strong support of the government, the development of urban industry and commerce has also achieved significant results. The number of industrial and commercial enterprises in Harbin has increased to 26,506, including 15,405 industrial enterprises and 11,101 commercial enterprises (including state-owned and private). Jilin was liberated not long ago, and the industrial and commercial enterprises in the city, which were in a state of stagnation, recovered more than 90% (more than 3,200) in late April. As of mid-June, enterprises such as papermaking, flax, and cement have started construction. According to incomplete statistics at the end of March this year, there were 4,255 private industrial and commercial enterprises in Andong, an increase of 526 from November last year. Mudanjiang has changed from a consumer city to a production city. According to statistics in April, there were 4,258 industrial and commercial enterprises, and the iron industry alone reached 34 factories. There were 803 newly opened industrial and commercial enterprises in Jiamusi in the first four months of this year, accounting for 31% of the original 3,577 enterprises. The characteristics of the development of industrial and commercial enterprises in various cities are that all those that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, abide by government laws and regulations, and are urgently needed by the military and civilians have been developed. The increase in the chemical industry in various places is an example; only luxury goods, superstitious items, antique dealers, and other industries that hinder the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as illegitimate industrial and commercial operators who engage in speculation and trickery, disrupt the economy, and adulterate and deceive people, are restricted and naturally eliminated.

　　The achievements in developing industry and commerce in the past three years are brilliant, but there are still many urgent problems to be solved, such as the planning of developing industry and commerce, implementing enterprise management, and implementing democratic management, so as to achieve the goals of sufficient raw materials, low costs, good quality, large quantities, and wide sales. In addition, the correct solution of problems such as the training of technical cadres, wages and welfare undertakings, and how to implement urban policies, how to implement the development of production, prosperity of the economy, public-private partnership, and labor-capital benefit are urgently needed for building a new Northeast.

　　东北三年概述
    （一）处在解放全东北的前夜
    三年来，东北人民解放战争获得了伟大的胜利，敌我力量的对比发生了根本的变化。东北人民解放军从对敌采取攻势防御，发展到全面进攻，而国民党军则从大举进攻变为防御，以至困守少数孤城并面临着全部被歼的命运。现在全东北（包括冀察热辽边区在内）一百五十余万平方公里的土地上，我军所占面积在百分之九十七以上，东西南北满及冀察热辽边区均已联成一片，而国民党军仅剩下沈阳、长春、锦州、承德等孤立据点。全东北（包括冀察热辽边区在内）二百六十四座城市，在我军手中者有二百三十座（包括新设县治及旗在内），敌军则被我分割孤立而困守在三十四座大小城市中。全东北（包括冀察热辽边区在内）五千余万人口中，在我区者有四千二百余万，在敌区者七百余万。
    三年来的东北战局，可分为三个时期：第一个时期从一九四五年十月国民党军进攻山海关起，至一九四六年十二月止。这期间，敌人集结优势兵力，攻占了中长路长沈段，及北宁、承锦、吉沈、平梅、梅辑、安沈、大通等铁路沿线及附近城市，我军以削弱及消灭敌军有生力量、保持与发展我之有生力量为目的，对敌采取攻势防御。在这一时期的作战中，共歼敌六万余人，并争取蒋军一八四师潘朔端等光荣起义。这期间敌军战斗力普遍受到损失，迫使其从集中转到分散。而在解放区后方，我则剿灭大股国民党胡匪及“地下中央军”近十万人，匪首李华堂、谢文东、王乃康、曹兴武、姜鹏飞等均被生俘正法。第二个时期自一九四七年一月起至四月止。东北蒋匪采取北守南攻的方针。以其机动兵力连续四次进犯我临江一带狭小地区。南满我军奋力作战，四保临江；北满我军则三下江南，威逼吉（林）长（春），使国民党军首尾失顾，其南攻北守的作战方针完全破产。这一时期我军共歼敌六万九千余，收复城市十一座。基本上停止了东北敌人的战略进攻，迫使其转到了防御。第三个时期是从去年五月到现在。我军转为全面进攻，迫使敌人处于防御分割孤立状态。其中经过去年的夏季攻势，历时五十余天，共歼敌八万九千余人，收复城市四十二座，使东西南北满联成一片，并打走了杜聿明。去年九月中旬发动秋季攻势，先后将蒋匪从关内增来的援兵给以歼灭性的打击，切断北宁线，再次切断中长路长沈段，使长春、吉林完全陷于孤立，使敌人完全处于被动挨打的境地。秋季攻势五十余日，共歼敌六万九千余。收复城市十五座。十二月发动冬季攻势，其时我军冒零下四十度奇寒，进行了一连串的攻坚作战，打下蒋匪设有坚固防御工事之彰武、新立屯、辽阳、鞍山、四平等城镇，并全歼各该地守敌。匪首陈诚因惨败下台而代以卫匪立煌。今年二月二十五日，我军对营口发动攻击时，又争取了守军暂五十八师的起义。敌慑于我军之攻坚能力，以一个军据守且设有永久性防御工事之吉林城亦不敢固守，吉林守军六十军钻隙逃至长春，我乃解放吉林。冬季攻势三个月作战中，共歼敌十五万余人，收复城市十六座。今年五月上旬至月底，冀察热辽边区我军发动攻势，二十天中歼敌七千余人，克城五座，热河全境除承德外均告解放。
    三年来，总计东北我军共歼敌四十四万余人（这只是按各次战役及较大的战斗计算，其他较小或零星战斗中歼敌数字均未包括在内，又去年夏季攻势前冀察热辽边区我军歼敌数字亦未包括在内）。另歼国民党胡匪等则在十万以上。
    经过土地改革及生产运动，广大人民从各方面支援解放战争，直接参军参战的热情与规模，也随着战争规模的发展而一次比一次的增大。去年秋天，我军后方各军区在此种基础上共建立了十万人以上的二线兵团，经过新式整训后于今春开赴前线，接着又建立了更强大的二期二线兵团。而参战民工，则随着战争的需要而有组织的开赴前方服务。
    （二）经过土改农村面貌一新
    与前线解放战争的不断胜利同时，后方基本区域内则取得了土地改革的伟大胜利。整个土改运动，共经历了四个阶段：第一阶段从四六年七月到十一月为清算和分地时期；当时曾派一万二千个干部，组织工作团下乡，挨家挨户的找贫农雇农及中农的积极分子，先开小会，经过诉苦酝酿，发动了普遍的斗争，给予当时农村中最大的汉奸恶霸、地主、土匪头子以初步打击。但当时强大狡猾的封建势力，一则是公开用土匪或其他方法抗拒、破坏，一则是采取假斗争、假农会、假分地、威胁、收买落后分子等以逃避土改；加之我主、客观条件之限制，使当时土改工作普遍地存在着“夹生饭”状态。第二阶段从四六年十二月到去年六月为“煮夹生饭”时期：这时期的斗争更深入更细致，逐屯逐村的发动群众，检查前期工作，对未打垮的大的封建堡垒，进一步摧毁，并从中进行纯洁革命队伍的工作，把过去封建敌人派来的狗腿子以及某些投机分子，一一甄别清楚，使土改取得进一步的胜利。但封建敌人在此时期，仍继续隐蔽其封建财产及一部分土地枪支，以图再起，于是为了彻底消灭敌人，乃进一步开展了砍大树挖财宝斗争。第三阶段从四七年七月到十一月为砍挖运动时期：在前两阶段工作和解放军夏季攻势巨大胜利的基础上，运动发展更猛烈，无论从斗争规模和深入程度来看均比前一时期更为深入。查出了黑地，搜出地主的藏枪，挖出底产，使封建势力在较多的地方遭受更严重的打击，农民进一步的当权作主。第四阶段从四七年十二月到今年二月为平分土地运动时期：在上一阶段基础上，存在的问题是：部分封建势力未消灭，土地分配尚有不公，须要按土地法大纲规定进行重新平分或调整，于是从去年十二月起又掀起平分土地运动，将以前未彻底消灭的封建势力彻底消灭了，以前未分好的土地，加以重新平分或调整了，使土改工作基本完成。
    在土地改革过程中，虽然成绩是主要的，但由于各种具体原因，也曾产生过某些错误。例如在清算分地再煮夹生饭时期，曾对彻底消灭封建势力的认识不够明确，在某些地区对大中地主曾有某些过分的照顾（如留地过多），而损害了农民的利益。在砍挖运动和平分土地运动时期，则曾发生了若干过“左”的错误，如侵犯工商业，地主富农未能分别处理，侵犯了某些中农的利益等等。上述这些错误，都已及时的分别的加以纠正。
    在土改胜利的基础上，东北农村中出现了亘古未有的新局面。首先是极端不合理的封建土地制度完全被废除，而代之以耕者有其田的制度。过去东北农村占人口仅百分之十的地主富农，独占百分之八十的土地，高租低资残酷地剥削农民；而占人口百分之八十的雇农、贫农、中农则仅占有百分之二十的土地。经过土改后，地主的土地、财产和富农多余的土地、牲口等已按农村的人口平均分配了。据松江、黑龙江、合江、嫩江四省的不完全统计，被没收或征收而平分了的土地有五千余万亩，牛马四十万零八千匹，金子一万九千五百余两，银子四万七千三百余斤，衣服五百二十余万件（以上数字除平分土地亩数系包括整个土改时期外，余皆为平分土地运动时期的统计）。在合江省，经过平分土地运动后，农民平均每人分得七亩到十二亩土地，每四十亩到七十亩地即有一头顶用的牲口，大多数贫雇农都是每家有一头牲口，住房和衣服问题也都解决了。黑龙江全省绝大多数贫雇农每家都有一匹马，甚至两匹马。这样就打下了农民劳动致富的物质基础，过去无地无衣无食的惨况已经一去不复返了。因之农民生产情绪激增，据东北八省与哈尔滨市的初步统计：今年播种已逾一千一百三十六万垧（每垧十亩），并开了近六十万垧的荒地。各地已大部把男女劳动力和畜力组织起来，实行在自愿两利下的插犋换工，克服了今年严重的粮荒与天灾，使夏锄中在相当多的地区内做到三铲三“趟”的要求，打下今年丰收的基础。其次是地主阶级的政治淫威一扫而光，新民主主义的民主政治已开始建立起来。现在农村的一切建设——生产、政权、教育、水利、……都掌握在百分之九十以上的劳动人民的手中。雇农、贫农、中农及其他劳动人民担任政权的委员和主席，由劳动人民按民主集中制的原则组织起来，而群众对会议的民主生活已有相当习惯。他们对于自己的政府、自己的干部，已敢于进行公开的监督和批评。
    （三）发展城市工商业
    在军事胜利及土地改革的基础上，后方展开了规模巨大的恢复和发展工商业的生产建设运动。这一工作开始是在极端困难的情况下进行的：首先必要克服日伪时代殖民地经济所遗留下来的畸形状态，使经济建设为支援战争与改善人民生活服务，使城市为农村的经济发展服务，从而建设新民主主义的经济。其次，由于“八一五”后日寇及国民党疯狂的破坏，工矿设备遭受严重损失，城市工商业陷于凋零停滞，因此加重了我们恢复建设工作的困难。特别在去年夏季攻势以前，东北解放区被敌人分割，有机器的地方无原料，有原料的地方又无机器，加之技术人员的缺乏，使恢复和发展大受阻碍。为了克服这些困难，一开始就确定了要依靠工人、发动工人的方针，结果得到很好成效。东北工友们不仅不辞辛苦，积极参加了恢复修建工程，献出了大批珍贵器材，而且用他们的智慧，修复了很多庞大的复杂的机器（如工人刘英源之修复哈尔滨发电机等等），奠定了恢复工作的初步基础。其后，在广泛展开的生产运动中，工友们又高度发挥了劳动热忱，使很多工作中的生产率，超过伪满时的最高峰。特别自去年财经会议以来，在集中统一领导下，各项企业已逐渐由分散、无计划的生产的局面开始走上统一的、有计划的企业化经营，为今后更大规模的发展铺平了道路，打下支援全国胜利、建设新东北的基础。
    在采矿方面，煤矿生产现已走向大量生产的时期。每个工人每日平均生产率已达零点五吨，超过伪满时百分之六十七。仅北满四大矿区，今年就可以产煤五百万吨。同时，发展重工业所必需的焦煤生产也超过了预定计划（仅仅煤矿区便超过百分之一百七十六），所产焦煤，每斤可熔五斤以上的生铁。北满四大金矿区已完成原定收金计划，并正努力完成今年新的收金计划。此外，铁矿、铜矿、铝矿等也已部分开采。
    在工业生产方面，军工事业，已从无到有，从小到大。有的工厂今年三月以后的产量比去年十二月份提高了二倍至三倍。各厂生产的军火，及时的保证了前方的军需供给。遭受国民党匪军的破坏濒于全部停顿的南满纺织业，已逐步恢复，仅公营的东北第三纺织厂，今年头三个月就纺纱七十九万六千斤，织棉布二万三千四百多匹。北满的纺织业也从无到有，改旧更新，几个较大纺织厂今年头五个月即共出产了棉纱九万余捆，棉布三万余匹，棉毯六万余条。北满特有的亚麻纺织，也开始恢复。纺织业的发展，已经部分的解决了布匹的困难。
    占全国林区四分之三的东北森林业。也已逐渐走向大规模的、统一有计划的经营。本年度出木材总数将达一百四十五万立方公尺以上。
    在交通邮电方面，东北解放区已拥有铁路一万零七百五十公里，绝大多数都已畅通。现为敌盘踞的仅六百零三公里，只占东北铁路的百分之五。北满电业的发展，已使今年头五个月的发电量比去年同一时期增加百分之百，其中百分之六十七点七用于动力；南满南部的电力用户已达二、四○七户。至于邮政电讯现已做到各省畅通；仅邮件一项，过去一年中就由一九三、三七零件，增至一、五七一、八三五件。
    在中共保护和发展工商业的政策指导下，加以政府的大力扶助，城市工商业的发展亦有显著成绩。哈尔滨的工商业已经增至二六、五零六家，其中工业一五、四○五家，商业一一、一零一家（包括公营私营）。吉林解放不久，全市陷于停滞的工商业，在四月下旬就恢复了百分之九十以上（三千二百余家），截至六月中旬，更有造纸、亚麻、洋灰等企业开工。安东的私营工商业，据今年三月底不完全的统计，已达四千二百五十五家，比去年十一月增加了五百二十六家。牡丹江从消费城市转为生产城市，四月份统计已有工商业四千二百五十八家，仅铁工业一项即达三十四厂。佳木斯新开的工商业今年头四个月便有八百零三家，占原有三千五百七十七家的百分之三十一。各城市工商业发展的特点是，凡有益于国计民生、遵守政府法令、为军民所急需的都得到发展，各地化学工业的增加即是一例；只有妨碍国计民生的奢侈品、迷信品、古物商等业及投机取巧、捣弄经济、掺假骗人的非正当工商业者，才受到限制和自然淘汰。
    三年来发展工商业的成绩是辉煌的，但是也还存在着很多急待解决的问题，例如发展工商业的计划性，贯彻经营企业化和实行管理民主化，以达到原料足、成本低、质量好、数量多、销路广的目的。此外如培养技术干部、工资与福利事业问题以及如何贯彻城市政策、如何贯彻发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利等等问题的正确解决，对建设新东北都有迫切的需要。
