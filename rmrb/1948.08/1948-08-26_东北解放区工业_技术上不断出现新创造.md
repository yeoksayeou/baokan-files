Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 24th: The industry in the Northeast Liberated Areas is constantly seeing new technical innovations. (1) The "China-East Oil Refining Research Institute" has successfully researched the use of pine root oil, abundantly produced in the nearby mountains, to manufacture fuel oil and Mao's Lu oil. It has now raised funds to start a factory and is officially shipping goods. (2) Workers at the Electrical Repair Factory of the Harbin Railway Bureau devised a method to solve the raw material difficulties when manufacturing telephones. Soon, workers Fan Shiyuan, Liu Chunsheng, and others in the work group researched and used thin wood to replace bakelite. Veteran workers stayed up for two nights, researching the use of black lead powder to replace carbon plates and carbon pots. They made every effort to utilize waste materials during manufacturing, and have now completed more than 170 units. (3) Qiqihar City's Hesheng Alkali Shop allocated more than 4 million yuan of alkali production capital to produce absorbent cotton from used cotton. After successful trials, it is now shipping goods in large quantities. The manufacturing method involves boiling the used cotton in boiling water for more than twelve hours, then bleaching it with bleaching powder, degreasing it with blue water, and after disinfecting and drying, fluffing it up. After fluffing, it is disinfected, packaged, and used. (4) Liu Shixun and other workers in the Technology Office of the Harbin Railway Locomotive Depot have transformed the "locomotive connecting rod stone alkali oil cup." This type of oil cup originally used an oil pump to press oil into it, but due to the lack of oil pump heads, locomotive technicians had to remove the oil cup and fill it, which easily damaged the threads on the connecting rod, and the oil supply was small, wasting oil and time. Since it was transformed into an "oil cup style oil plug," the oil cup has an oil plug inside that can be turned on at any time. The oil cup has a large hollow capacity, the double-layered thread is not easy to damage the connecting rod, saving oil and time. After being produced, it was tested on several locomotives, and the results were good. Now all locomotives are preparing to install it. Workers in the preparation room used steel wire to make "locomotive cylinder packing springs" with good results. Making one jin of steel wire packing springs can save the public more than 100,000 yuan (Northeast currency). (5) The No. 2 long web machine of the Northeast Second Paper Mill has been repaired. During the repair, workers used red bricks to replace sandpaper to remove rust, which can save 3,000 sheets of sandpaper, worth 1.5 million yuan. Paper copying workers carefully cleared the slurry small holes, paid attention to the thickness of the paper, and engineering personnel installed a re-use water tank, reducing pulp loss by 12 percent.

　　东北解放区工业
  　技术上不断出现新创造
    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北解放区工业，不断出现技术上的新创造。（一）“中东炼油研究所”研究用附近山里大宗出产之松根油，制造燃料油及毛氏鲁油已获成功，现已集资开办工厂，正式出货。（二）哈市铁路局电气修缮厂工人，于制造电话机时设法解决原料困难，旋工组工人樊世元、刘春生等即研究用细木代替了胶木，老工人两夜未睡，研究出用黑铅粉代替炭素板和炭素壶。制造时他们均尽量利用废料，刻已完成一百七十余架。（三）齐齐哈尔市和盛碱庄，将制碱资本拨出四百余万元，用旧棉花制脱脂棉，试验成功后已大批出货。其制造办法，系将旧棉花经沸水煮十二小时以上，然后用漂白粉漂过，再用蓝水脱脂，经消毒干燥后弹松，弹完再行消毒包制装用。（四）哈市铁路机务段技术室刘士勋等工人，改造了“机车连结棒石硷油油壶”。此种油壶原用油泵往里压油，但因缺乏油泵头，机车技工就将油壶卸下来往里装油，容易弄坏连结棒上的丝机，且给油量亦少，浪费油脂也浪费时间。自改造成“油壶式的油拴”后，油壶内部有油拴，可以随时拧油，油壶空心容量较大，双层丝扣不易损坏连结棒，省油又省时间，制出后，经数台机车试验，结果良好，现各机车都准备按装。预备室工人，用钢丝作出“机车汽筒盘根簧”效果亦好。制一斤钢丝的盘根簧，可为公家节省十余万元（东北币）。（五）东北第二造纸厂二号长网机已经修竣。在修建中，工人们利用红砖代替砂纸擦锈，可节省砂纸三千张，值一百五十万元。抄纸工细心疏通流浆小孔，注意纸的薄厚，工务人员装设再用水糟，减少纸浆损失百分之十二。
