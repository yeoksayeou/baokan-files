    【Taiyue Telegram】After cadres in Duanshi Town, Qinshui County, led the masses to correct the "leftist" deviations in the land reform and Party rectification, they immediately turned to actively leading production. The town has weeded 686 mu of early millet three times, and more than 1,600 mu of miscellaneous fields have also been weeded twice. On July 14th, when the cadres were discussing the burden assessment, it suddenly rained heavily. They immediately stopped the burden assessment and went to various villages to mobilize and organize the masses to rush to plant. Some people said, "This is a heavy rain, the slopes are not soaked through, and there is standing water in the low-lying areas, so we can't plant." Others said sarcastically, "Is planting still useful? Throwing beans on the ground is only good for fertilizer!" The cadres were not discouraged or impatient, and continued to persuade and mobilize everyone. Branch Secretary Li Farong and other cadres reasoned that the masses were unwilling to plant now, mainly because they were afraid of wasting labor and seeds. They used the fact that the leadership proposed "cut one piece, plant one piece" during the summer harvest, and those who planted accordingly now have seedlings that are more than a foot tall; while those who were afraid to plant are still barren. This persuaded most of the masses. For the few who were still unwilling to plant, they continued to patiently persuade them. Zhang Keyi, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, said to Yu Hu, "Your land and my land are together. I planted a day earlier and all the seedlings have taken root. If you plant a day later, there won't be enough seedlings." Everyone realized the principle that "planting one day earlier means harvesting ten days earlier," and the whole village mobilized. In three days, they planted more than 860 mu of land, and the land of military families and conscripted laborers who had no labor force was also planted. Just after planting, it happened to rain heavily, and everyone was happy, saying that a good autumn harvest was expected.

    沁水端氏镇抓的紧
    早谷锄过三遍
    晚秋也都种完
    【太岳电】沁水端氏镇干部领导群众纠正了土改与整党中左的偏向后，即转入积极领导生产。该镇已将早谷六八六亩锄过三遍，一千六百余亩杂田也锄过两遍。七月十四日干部们正在评议负担时，忽然下了四指雨，他们立即停止评议负担，分头到各闾动员组织群众抢种。有的群众说：“这是猛雨，坡坡地没透，洼地有积水，不能种。”还有人说风凉话：“种还能没用？把豆倒在地里还能顶粪啦！”干部们没有灰心和急躁，继续说服动员大家，支部书记李发荣和其他干部研究群众现在不愿种，主要是怕白费工，白费种籽。就用夏收时领导上提出：“割一块种一块”，有的照着种了，现在苗子长有一尺多高；怕种的现在还是白地的事实说服群众，把绝大部分群众的思想说通了。对个别仍不愿种的，继续耐心说服，武委会主任张克义对玉虎说：“你的地和我的地在一块，我早种了一天，全捉住苗啦，你迟种了一天就不够苗。”大家认识了“早种一天早收十日”的道理，全村都动员起来了，三天就把八百六十多亩地都种好了，无劳力的军属和参战民工的地也都种完。刚种完，恰巧就落了这场大透雨，人人喜欢，都说秋收有望。
