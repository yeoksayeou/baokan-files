    Rectifying Experiences in Substitute Farming and Labor Allocation
    Jilu Yu Correspondence
    In the Jilu Yu region, frequent warfare last year led to a large number of substitute farmers for those who joined the army, placing a heavy burden on the masses. Furthermore, the chaotic and unreasonable burden system, with too many people exempt from labor and too few actually performing it, greatly impacted production. According to investigations in six villages—Yancunpu in Fan County, Sangshu in Shanghe Tuo, Jiuduyang in Liaoyang, Longwangmiao in Yanggu, Shihai Zi in Zhuangping, and Sanlipu—out of 822 people who should have been available for labor, only 379 actually performed it. Those exempt included village cadres of all levels, even squad leaders, committee members, families of soldiers, workers, and martyrs, deserters, landlords performing labor service, and even close relatives of village cadres. The scope of substitute farming extended to village cadres, honored soldiers, deserters, and stretchers bearers on duty, in addition to families of soldiers, workers, and martyrs. Consequently, the masses faced an extremely heavy labor burden. For example, Cui Yutian, a villager from Caiying in Hua County, was unable to work his own land for 160 out of 240 days from February to September last year. However, only about 50 days were actually spent on war support, dike building, and substitute farming for families of soldiers, workers, and martyrs. Miscellaneous tasks in the village accounted for 41 days, and village and district meetings wasted 66 days of agricultural time. Moreover, in some areas, those who provided livestock for labor were not counted as performing labor, putting livestock-raising households at a great disadvantage; in others, labor was calculated by the number of trips rather than by the number of days, which was extremely unreasonable; some areas forced mutual aid, forming disguised labor allocation, benefiting village cadres and non-laboring orphans and widows; some areas required all agricultural work to be done collectively, resulting in significant waste of manpower; and some areas forcibly stipulated that 40 mu of land must jointly purchase one ox, with small merchants in Fan County city being forced to cooperate with farmers, leading to unwillingness from both sides and losses for both. Last year, taxes were levied per mu in various regions, but land was not converted into a standardized unit, making the burden very unreasonable; coupled with the waste and disorder of village expenditure, the burden became even heavier. In Caiying Village, Hua County, village expenses alone amounted to 14 jin of coarse grain per mu from February to September last year; in Jiuduyang Village, Liaoyang, village expenses amounted to 12 jin and 11 liang per mu for the entire year. Therefore, the masses urgently demanded a reduction in the burden and a rationalization of the burden.
    Based on the above situation, we have made preliminary solutions. First, reduce labor allocation and increase the number of people performing labor: it is stipulated that anyone old enough for the militia must be available for labor. Second, reduce substitute farming. Third, the wheat tax this year will be provisionally levied based on the appraised output. Fourth, all forcibly formed mutual aid groups will be disbanded, and voluntary combinations will be re-established based on equivalent exchange. The rectification of labor allocation, substitute farming, and mutual aid has begun in individual key villages. Some villages have already achieved results. Now, the solution in Mudan Street Village in Gaoling County is written for reference.
    Mudan Street Village has 248 households with 958 people and 3278 mu of land, equivalent to 2665 mu of standardized land, with 138.5 full and semi-laborers. There are 71 families of soldiers, workers, and martyrs, with 1093 mu of land, all of which is substitute farmed by the village's livestock, with each animal burdened with 40 to 50 mu. No matter how it is substitute farmed, it cannot be finished. It is also stipulated that military families must be planted first, so their own land is bound to be poorly planted. The masses feel it is not cost-effective and want to sell their livestock. The militia's substitute farming has no definite method, and as many as needed are dispatched, and the team members complain that the labor is heavy. Military families with labor do not farm the land, and even if they have livestock, they want to sell it and have others substitute farm it. The militia and 17 cadres are exempt from labor.
    When solving these problems recently, the first step was to have the masses discuss the following principles. I. Substitute Farming: (1) Non-military families, orphans, and those without labor will generally not have their land substitute farmed. They can find relatives and neighbors to farm it, and the rent is negotiated by both parties. If they cannot find anyone, the production committee will introduce someone. (2) Military families with labor must participate in labor and will not have their land substitute farmed; if their labor is small and they cannot farm all the land, it can be substitute farmed; if they have a lot of land, they should buy livestock if they should buy livestock, and if they do not buy it, the grass will be given to the livestock that substitute farms the land. (3) Military families without labor will have their land substitute farmed without compensation. II. Labor Allocation: All those who do not leave production will be uniformly incorporated into the militia for labor, including the militia and village cadres. Militia departure counts as labor, village cadres attending district meetings count as labor, livestock and the owners who accompany the livestock count as labor, and all labor is recorded in the account.
    After holding a meeting for military families to mobilize them, 17 military families reported that they did not need substitute farming, and some other families reported that some of their land did not need substitute farming, reducing the substitute farmed land by 675 mu. A total of 54 households needed substitute farming, with a total of 418 mu of land, a decrease of more than 60% compared to the original. After two or three days of group deliberation and group leader meetings, it was decided that in addition to the labor and livestock of military families, 114 people and 34 head of livestock would remain for substitute farming. The land was distributed based on labor and livestock, with one person assigned 2.5 mu of land and one head of livestock assigned 3.75 mu of land. A few mu were left over and added to the large livestock. The most land assigned to a large livestock did not exceed 4.5 mu. In this way, two households with two people and two livestock were assigned 12.5 mu of land, which could be plowed in three days (with one person participating). Households without livestock were assigned 5 mu of land for two people, which would take four days to plow. Everyone debated and felt that households without livestock were at a disadvantage. After research, the distant land was assigned to households with livestock (to save effort in transporting manure). Military families could freely find substitute farming households. For military families without labor but with livestock, the village helped with labor, and those who helped plant would have two mu counted as one mu. Households without livestock said: "This method is the best. Two mu of land can be done early in the morning and late in the evening. We can freely combine, and we can push the manure into the field during the midday break." Households raising livestock said: "Substitute farming for a dozen mu for two households is nothing. Our family can push the mill and do some processing. We don't need to sell the livestock." Then, three households exchanged their broken livestock for good livestock. Only two representatives of military families were dissatisfied, because they used to have labor but did not work, and the land was completely substitute farmed.
    Regarding the issue of labor allocation, after group deliberation and discussion, only the secretary and the grain and finance committee member were exempt from labor in the entire village. In the future, new accounts will be established for labor allocation, and the secretary will be responsible for registration. Those aged 15 to 18 are in the youth class, those aged 50 to 60 are in the elderly class, and those aged 45 to 50 are in the semi-elderly class. The elderly and youth classes can perform short and light labor. Full and semi-laborers are recorded equally for the same work, but the work points for light and heavy work must be doubled. Village cadres and militia must all be available for labor. At first, it was difficult to get through to them, but after specific calculations, only one or two cadres were very busy; some cadres had nothing to do all day, and they themselves felt that it was unreasonable not to be available for labor; the militia initially wanted to hand in their guns and quit, but compared to the masses, who were carrying stretchers and available for labor, the militia had more work points for combat support. Thinking about it this way, they had previously benefited from not being available for labor, and now they were not at a disadvantage, and they understood.
    In solving the problems of substitute farming and labor allocation, there has been some resistance in various places, but with the leadership's persistence in implementation, various places have begun to discuss and solve them specifically. There are also shortcomings in solving this problem, namely, insufficient understanding of the characteristics of farmers who have just left production and insufficient consideration of the production and living difficulties of their families, which should be treated differently. In addition, there is still no appropriate solution to the village fund problem, and investigations have begun.

### 整顿代耕支差经验

　　整顿代耕支差经验
  　冀鲁豫通讯
    冀鲁豫区战争频繁，去年参军后代耕人数很多，群众负担较重。加上负担制度紊乱与不合理，不出差的与被代耕的人太多，出差的太少，更大大影响了生产。根据范县颜村铺、尚和拓桑树、聊阳九都阳、阳谷龙王庙、庄平石海子、卅里铺六个村调查，应出差的八百二十二人，实出差的只三百七十九人。不出差的包括大小村干以至班长、委员、军、工、烈属、逃兵、服劳役地主，甚至村干近门。代耕范围，除军、工、烈属外，村干、荣誉军人、逃兵、出差的担架均代耕。因之群众劳力负担极重。如滑县蔡营村民崔玉田，去年二月至九月二百四十天中，一百六十天不能做自己活。但真正用在战勤、打堤、给军工烈属代耕的只五十多天。支村中杂差四十一天，区村开会耽误农时六十六天。此外，有些地区随牲口出差的人不算差、喂牲口户吃亏太大；有些地区出差按趟数不按天数，也极不合理；有些地区强迫互助，形成变相支差，村干、孤寡不劳动者沾光；有些地区一切农活都要集体干，人力浪费很大；有的地区强制规定四十亩地须合买一牛，范县城里强迫小商贩与农民互助种地，两不自愿，双方都受损失。去年各地按亩征收，土地未折合，负担很不合理；加上村款开支的浪费紊乱，负担更重了。滑县蔡营去年二月至九月，光村款负担每亩粗粮十四斤，聊阳九都阳去年一年村款负担每亩十二斤十一两。所以群众迫切要求减轻负担和负担合理化。
    根据以上情况，我们进行了初步的解决。一、减少支差，增加支差人数：规定凡够自卫队年龄的一律出差。二、减少代耕。三、今年麦征暂按产量评议征收。四、凡强迫组成的互助组一律解散，重新自愿结合，等价交换。支差、代耕、互助等已在个别重点村着手整理。有些村已获成绩。现将高陵县牡丹街村的解决情形写出供参考。
    牡丹街全村二四八户，九五八口人，土地三二七八亩，合标准地二六六五亩，劳力与半劳力共折一三八个半。共有军工烈属七一户。其土地一○九三亩，全部由村中牲口代耕，每个牲口负担四十至五十亩，无论如何代耕不过来。又规定须先给军属种，自己地必然种不好。群众觉得不合算，都想卖牲口。自卫队代耕无一定办法，需要几个派几个，队员都嫌差重。军属们有劳力不种地，有牲口也要卖了，叫人家代耕。民兵与十七个干部都不支差。
    最近解决这些问题时，首先是让群众依据下列原则进行讨论。一、代耕：（１）非军属的一般孤寡无劳力户不代耕，可找亲戚近门给种，租子由双方协商。自己找不到人的，生产委员会给介绍。（２）军属有劳力的必须参加劳动，不代耕；如劳力小，种不了的土地可代耕；地多应买牲口的要买牲口，不买的把草给代耕的牲口吃。（３）军属无劳力的无代价代耕。二、支差：凡不脱离生产的人，统一编入自卫队支差，民兵与村干在内。民兵出发算差，村干到区开会算差，牲口及随牲口出发的主人均算差，出差都记帐。
    开了个军属会进行动员，有十七户军属自报不用代耕，另有些户一部土地不用代耕，共减少代耕地六百七十五亩。需要代耕的共五十四户，土地四百一十八亩，比原来减少百分之六十多。又经两三天小组酝酿与小组长会议讨论，结果除了军属的劳力与牲口外，剩一一四人与牲口三十四头代耕。以劳力牲口分配土地，一个人分地二亩半，一个牲口分地三亩七分五。还剩几亩，加到大牲口上。大牲口最多也不超过四亩半地。这样，两户两个人两个牲口分地十二亩半，犁地三天可完（一人参加）。不喂牲口户两人分地五亩，倒地得四天。大家发生争论，觉得没牲口户吃亏。经研究，将远地分给有牲口户（牲口送粪省事）。军属可自由找代耕户。没劳力而有牲口的军属，村里帮人工，帮种者种二亩算一亩。没牲口户说：“这办法最好啦。二亩多地一早一晚就做啦。咱自由结合，歇晌时把粪都推到地里啦。”喂牲口户说：“两户代耕十来亩不算什么，家里人推推磨、加加工就做啦。牲口不用卖啦。”接着就有三户把坏牲口换买成了好牲口。只有两个军属代表不满，原因是他们以前有劳力也不动，地完全代耕着。
    支差问题，经过小组酝酿讨论，全村只有书记和财粮委员不出差。以后支差立新帐，由书记负责登记。十五至十八岁为少年班，五十至六十岁为老年班，四十五至五十岁为半老班。老少年班可以出短差、轻差。整劳力与半劳力如做一样的活，即一样记工，但轻重差记工要差一倍。村干民兵一律支差，开始打不通；但经具体计算，村干中只有一两个人忙得很；有的干部整天没什么事，自己也感到不支差不合理；民兵一开始曾要交枪不干，但和群众一比，人家一样抬担架支差，而民兵出战勤工多了还要抵工。这样一想，以前自己不支差是占了便宜，现在支差也并不吃亏，想通了。
    解决代耕与支差问题，各地都有过一些抵抗，但有领导上坚持贯彻，各地已开始由群众分别讨论，具体解决。在解决这问题上也有缺点，即对刚脱离生产的农民干部特点认识不足，对其家属的生产与生活困难，分别对待。此外，村款问题还无适当办法解决，现已着手调查。
