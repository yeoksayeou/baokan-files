　　[Jinan Telegram] The Tuhai River is a smooth-flowing river that needs dredging. The river passes through 47 li of eastern Gaotang. According to measurements by the River Authority, a total of 9,982 cubic meters of earth need to be moved to dredge it well, with the project divided into more than 400 sections. To complete this project, the county mobilized the entire county to work. Under the active leadership of cadres and the active efforts of 30,000 people, 160,000 cubic meters of earth were completed in ten days. In terms of organizational leadership, the county and district organized a river management command. Villages were organized into teams and classes (12 people per class, three classes per squad, each village as a company), with district cadres participating in each team to specifically grasp the leadership. At the same time, extensive ideological mobilization was carried out to enhance the confidence and morale of cadres and the masses. Many villages held meetings of branches, farmers' associations, etc., to carry out enlightening education, explaining the important significance of this project and proposing the slogan "Complete the project early and return home to production early." They also launched challenges and competitions between villages and villages, groups and groups, and individuals, rewarding model workers to educate everyone. Therefore, the masses were in high spirits and worked very hard. Duzhuang in District One, after being personally encouraged and praised by the county magistrate, completed a project of 47.5 zhang long and 3.5 chi deep, totaling 164 cubic meters of earth. Each person averaged 4 cubic meters of earth, and each person moved 2 cubic meters of earth per day, completing the task in two days. After completion, the district command awarded the glorious title of "Labor is Sacred" at the district river management conference, with prizes such as banners and medals, which influenced other villages to complete the work quickly. The active leadership of cadres and the lead taken by key personnel played a significant role in completing the project. At the same time, many model heroes emerged. For example, County Magistrate Guo, District Secretary Shi Ziwu of District Six, and Li Zemin of District Four all personally dug the river, stimulating and enhancing the morale of the masses. Wang Panlin, the director of the Farmers' Association of Dazhaozhuang in District One, dug the river despite his illness; Du Wensheng, the old hero of Zhangpu in District Five, carried earth like a young man; the cook of Changguantun in District Seven made three major guarantees to the river workers in his village: "Steamed buns will be hot, dishes will be clean, meals will be cooked on time and people will not be delayed, and there will be a constant supply of boiling water." All of these boosted the morale of the masses and ensured the rapid completion of the task.

　　高唐三万群众疏浚徒骇河
  　十天完成十六万方土
    【冀南电】徒骇河是一条需要疏浚的顺水河，该河通过高唐东部四十七里。经河务局测量，如疏浚好共需动土九九八二方土，工程四百余段。该县为完成这一工程，发动了全县总动工，在干部积极领导和三万群众积极努力下，十天内完成工程十六万方土。在组织领导上，县区组织了治河指挥部，村中编队编班（十二人为一班，三个班为一分队，每村为一中队），区干分头参加各队具体掌握领导。同时广泛进行思想动员，提高干部群众的信心与情绪。许多村庄召开支部、农会等会议，进行启发教育，说明这个工程之重要意义，提出“早完成早回家生产”的号召。并发动村与村，组与组，个人与个人挑战竞赛，奖励模范教育大家。因此群众情绪很高，工作都很上劲。一区杜庄，经县长亲自鼓励表扬后，全村长四十七丈五，深三尺五，共合一六四方土的工程，每人平均四方土，每人每天出二方土，结果两天完成任务。完工后，该区指挥部在全区治河大会上的以“劳工神圣”的光荣称号，奖以大旗奖章等奖品，影响了其他村庄迅速完工。干部积极领导和骨干带头，在完成工程中起了很大作用。同时也涌现出不少模范英雄。如郭县长、六区区书石子吾、四区李泽民等同志，都亲自动手挖河，刺激与提高了群众情绪。一区大赵庄农会主任王泮林，带病挖河；五区张铺老英雄杜文生抬土如青年；七区长官屯的伙夫，向本村河工们提出三大保证：“馒头热、菜干净，饭熟人不误吃，不断开水喝。”都鼓动了群众情绪，保证迅速完成任务。
