　　Jianye Iron Factory Improves Wage System
  　Employees Diligently Study Technology
    [Shijiazhuang News] The private Jianye Iron Factory in Zhengyi Street, District 3 of Shijiazhuang City, has improved its wage system three times, overcoming egalitarianism, and the workers' production enthusiasm has been increasing daily. The factory officially opened in March of this year, stipulating that all meals would be borne by the counter. The manager's monthly salary was 15,000 yuan, the deputy manager and ironworker兼电料 (concurrent electrician) Dong's technician salary was 14,000, ironworker 兼电料 (concurrent electrician) Wu's technician, the accountant, and the grinding worker all received 12,000 yuan, and the four apprentices with different years of service and different technologies each received 8,000 yuan. Later, due to rising prices, wages were paid according to the currency, which disadvantaged the workers. Therefore, according to the workers' request, starting in April, wages were converted to millet as the standard and paid in kind. In April, May, and June, the manager's salary was changed to 100 jin of millet, the deputy manager and Technician Dong each received 90 jin, the accountant, Technician Wu, and the grinding worker each received 80 jin, and the four apprentices each received 53 jin. There was a considerable amount of egalitarianism in the wages. Technician Dong, who had higher skills, received only 10 jin more than Technician Wu, who had lower skills. Apprentice Li Yuanzhang, although he had not been there long, had higher skills than the other three, and the wages were the same. As a result, these people were not enthusiastic, and work was pushed around and watched. As Technician Dong said: "If wages are not based on the level of technology, then those with high technology will have to keep up with those with low technology when working." Based on this reflection, the deputy manager solicited everyone's opinions, especially inquiring about Technician Dong's experience, and then stipulated the new wage standard for July: the manager 160 jin, the deputy manager and Technician Dong 150 jin, the newly hired tongs operator Technician Yang 200 jin, the accountant, Technician Wu, and the grinding worker all 120 jin, the coolie Li Longyi 90 jin, the apprentice Li Yuanzhang 70 jin, Tang Pei and Zhang Mian each 60 jin, and Zhang Shizhen 55 jin. The deputy manager called on everyone to work hard to improve their technology and cherish their tools, so that they could increase and change their wages. In the past month or so, the employees' interest in studying technology has increased, and the workers have paid attention to cherishing tools, and their technology has improved faster than before. Technicians Dong and Yang also took time to study and create, and the production enthusiasm of the entire factory has been increasing daily.

　　建业铁厂改进工资制度
  　员工努力钻研技术
    【石家庄讯】石市三区正义街私营建业铁工厂，经过三次改进工资制度，克服平均主义现象，工人生产情绪日见提高。该厂今年三月正式开业，规定伙食都由柜上负担，经理每月工资一万五千元，副理、铁工兼电料董技师各一万四，铁工兼电料邬技师、会计及开磨工人均一万二，四个不同工龄不同技术的学徒都是八千。后因物价上涨，工资按款发下，工人吃亏，遂根据工人要求，从四月份起以小米为标准改发实物。四、五、六月份经理改为小米一百斤，副理及董技师各九十斤，会计、邬技师、开磨工人均八十斤，四个学徒各五十三斤。工资上存在相当严重的平均主义现象，技术高的董技师比技术低的邬技师仅多十斤，学徒李元章虽年限不长，而技术高于其他三个，工资同是一样，结果这些人情绪不高，作工互相推让观望。正如董技师说：“工资如果不分技术高低，作工时技术高的就要向技术低的看齐。”副经理根据这个反映，征求大家意见，特别询问了董技师的经验，于是规定出七月份新工资标准：经理一百六十斤，副理、董技师一百五十斤，新用的掌钳杨技师二百斤，会计、邬技师、开磨工人均一百二十斤，苦力工人李龙义九十斤，学徒李元章七十斤，唐培、张绵各六十斤，张士珍五十五斤。副经理号召大家努力提高技术，爱惜工具，可以提高与改变工资。近一个多月来，员工们钻研技术的兴趣提高了，工徒们都注意了爱惜工具，技术较前进步快了。董、杨两技师抽暇挤空也去钻研创造，全厂生产情绪日见提高。
