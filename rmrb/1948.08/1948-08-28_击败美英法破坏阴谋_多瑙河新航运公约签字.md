Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. The Danube River Conference concluded victoriously on the 18th after finally passing the new Danube River navigation system convention and holding a signing ceremony on the same day. The day before the closing (the 17th), the Comprehensive Committee had completely reviewed the Soviet draft, which was unanimously adopted by the Danube River countries, with only individual clauses supplemented and amended. Some of these supplements and amendments were proposed by the Soviet Union based on proposals from the United States and France.

The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, who were intent on sabotaging the conference, consistently adopted an uncooperative attitude throughout the meeting, voting against or abstaining from or not participating in the voting on every clause, even amendments that they themselves had proposed and that the Danube River countries had agreed to. However, these actions could not prevent the passage of the new convention. Before the final draft of the new convention was formally voted on at the plenary session on the 18th, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France again declared their opposition to the new convention and refused to sign it. They stubbornly insisted that the 1921 Danube River Convention, which was stipulated as invalid by the supplementary protocol to the new convention, should remain valid, and repeatedly reiterated the argument that the new convention must be unanimously recognized by the signatory countries of the old convention to be effective.

This behavior of the US, British, and French representatives was sternly refuted by the Soviet representative Vyshinsky and the representatives of Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, etc. Vyshinsky pointed out that the 1921 convention was carried out under the blatant manipulation of Western countries, and even the old regimes of Romania and Yugoslavia at the time had protested. Before the vote, the Bulgarian representative proposed that since the United States, Britain, and France refused to sign the new convention, the three countries should be removed from the list of signatory countries in the preamble of the convention. This proposal was adopted by all the Danube River countries. Subsequently, the new convention was formally adopted with unanimous votes in favor from all the Danube River countries. The chairman of the conference, Vyshinsky, then announced the establishment of the new convention and congratulated the representatives of the Danube River countries.

At 7 p.m. that evening, the representatives of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia signed the new convention on behalf of their respective governments. With this, the Danube River Conference, which began on the 30th of last month, was declared a victorious conclusion. A navigation convention that truly represents the interests of the people of the Danube River region has thus been successfully formulated. Although US Secretary of State Marshall and French Foreign Minister Schuman rushed to issue statements "refusing to ratify" the new convention on this day, these were merely empty threats without any legal basis or practical effect. According to the provisions of the new convention, it will come into effect as soon as six governments have ratified the convention and deposited their instruments of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia.

　　击败美英法破坏阴谋
  　多瑙河新航运公约签字
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】多瑙河会议于十八日最后通过新的多瑙河航运制度公约，并于同日举行签字典礼后，已胜利闭幕。闭幕前一日（十七日），综合委员会已将苏联草案全部审查完毕，该草案获得多瑙河国家一致通过，仅有个别条款有所补充与修正，其中之若干补充与修正，系苏联根据美国与法国提案而提出的。存心破坏大会的美英法三国代表在会议中始终采取不合作态度，对每一条款，甚至他们自己提出而为多瑙河国家同意的修正案都投反对票，或弃权与不参加投票。但这些行动丝毫不能阻止新公约之通过。当十八日举行全体正式表决新公约最后定稿之前，美英法三国代表又声明反对这新公约并拒绝签字。他们固执主张那新公约补充议定书所规定为无效的一九二一年多瑙河公约应仍然有效，并喋喋不休地重复叙说新公约必须有旧公约签字国一致承认才能有效的论点。美、英、法代表这种行为，遭到苏联代表维辛斯基及罗、捷、匈、南等代表的严正驳斥，维辛斯基指出一九二一年的公约，是在西方国家露骨操纵之下进行的，甚至当时罗、南两国的旧政权都曾提出抗议。临表决前，保加利亚代表提议：既然美、英、法拒绝在新公约上签字，就应在公约序文的签约国名单中把该三国除名，这一提议为全体多瑙河国家通过。继之，新公约乃在全体多瑙河国家一致投赞成票下正式通过。会议主席维辛斯基当宣布新公约的成立，并向多瑙河各国代表致贺。当晚七时，苏、保、匈、罗、乌、捷、南七国代表代表各该国政府签署新公约。至此，自上月三十日开始的多瑙河会议乃宣告胜利闭幕。一部真正代表多瑙河人民利益的航运公约于是圆满制订完成。美国国务卿马歇尔与法国外交部长舒曼，虽然都赶着在这一天发表声明“拒绝批准”新公约，但这只是没有法律根据与实际效用的虚声恫吓而已。根据新公约规定，一俟有六国政府批准本公约，并将其批准书汇交南斯拉夫外交部存放后，新公约即行生效。
