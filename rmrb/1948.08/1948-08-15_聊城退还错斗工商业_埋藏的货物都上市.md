　　[Ji Lu Yu Electric Dispatch] Since the Cheng Guan District of Liaocheng has rectified its policies, industry and commerce have gradually shown signs of prosperity. Last year, during the land reform in the city, 129 industrial and commercial households were wrongly classified; 48 households have now been returned their property. Merchants are beginning to dare to boldly develop their businesses. In April, the county government issued a proclamation stating "Resolutely protect merchants who dig up buried goods," and merchants have been taking out and selling goods they had buried underground or hidden in the countryside. The masses of Democratic Street returned Liu Jingyue's brush and ink shop, and Liu Jingyue immediately unearthed a large quantity of buried brushes and ink. Yu Yunhong's general store on People's Street, which had hidden a large quantity of paper, brown sugar and other goods in the countryside, has also transported them into the city for sale. The owners of Hua Feng Dong Hao foreign goods store and Tong Xing Chang cloth store fled to Jinan. Unable to make a living in Jinan, and hearing that Liaocheng had rectified its policies and was returning industry and commerce, they both returned home and have taken out and sold cloth worth more than 3 million yuan. Those coming to Liaocheng from the KMT-controlled areas to do business have reached more than 50 people per day in July. The city is preparing to open a new north-south street in Dongguan recently to build a market. Merchants have been submitting petitions to the district government, competing for shop space. The number of industrial and commercial businesses has increased from the original 1,069 to 1,249. Liuyingji in Dongguan will also double in size along with the development of industry and commerce in the urban area. The number of livestock on the market has increased from 150 heads per market in the spring of this year to 800 heads per market in July. In order to ensure the free operation of merchants and the prosperity of the market, the government has streamlined the transaction procedures of Liuyingji. In the past, transaction fees were charged for all transactions, large and small. Now, they are only charged for grain, livestock, cotton, and cloth.
(Liuyingji has earnestly streamlined transaction procedures, stipulating that transaction fees are only charged for cotton, grain, etc., which is an improvement compared to the past. However, according to the regulations of the Border Region Government, no transaction fees should be charged for private trade that does not go through the exchange, so even if grain, cotton, etc. are traded without going through the exchange, no transaction fees should be charged. It should be implemented according to the regulations of the Border Region Government. - Editor) In order to further support the development of industry and commerce, the government has issued current loans, with loans reaching more than 34.9 million yuan in June. Now, in addition to continuing to issue a large number of current loans, it is also preparing to issue low-interest or interest-free loans to support those in industry and commerce who were wrongly classified, so that they can achieve full recovery and development.

　　聊城退还错斗工商业　埋藏的货物都上市
    【冀鲁豫电】聊城城关区端正政策以来，工商业逐渐呈现繁荣气象。该城去年土改中错斗了工商业一百二十九户，现已退还四十八户。商人开始敢于大胆放手发展业务。在四月份，县府发出“坚决保护商人挖出埋藏的货物”的布告，商人埋在地下或隐藏在乡下的货物，都纷纷取出出售。民主街群众退还了刘敬月的笔墨庄，刘敬月即将埋藏的大批笔墨起出。人民街于云洪杂货店隐藏在乡下大批纸张红糖等货，也已运进城来出售。华丰东号洋×庄、同兴昌布庄的东家逃往济南，在济南生活无着，又听见聊城端正政策、退还工商业，都回了家，已将价值三百余万元的布匹取出出卖。从蒋管区来聊城营商者，七月份每日达五十余人。该城准备最近在东关新辟一条南北街，建设一个市场。商人纷纷向区政府递送呈文，竞争铺面。工商业已由原来的一千零六十九家增至一千二百四十九家。东关柳营集随城关工商业的发展，也将扩大一倍。上市的牲口，由今年春天每集百五十头，增到七月份每集八百头。政府为了保障商人自由经营，繁荣市场，曾整理了柳营集交易手续，过去大小买卖都抽交易费，现在只限粮食、牲口、棉花和布匹。
    （柳营集认真整理交易手续，规定只限于棉花、粮食等抽交易费，比较过去已经改进，但按边府规定，凡不经过交易所的私人贸易，一律不抽交易费，所以，即使是粮食、棉花等成交而不经过交易所者，也不应抽交易费，应按边府规定执行。——编者）政府为进一步扶助工商的发展，特发放活期贷款，六月份贷款达三万四千九百余万元。现在除继续大量发放活期贷款外，并准备发放低利或无利贷款，扶持被错斗工商业者，使能达到完全恢复和发展。
