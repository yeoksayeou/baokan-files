    Infantry-Artillery Coordination in Close Cooperation
    Unified Planning with Mutual Supervision and Inspection
    Suppressing Enemy Fire to Successfully Scale the City
    [Pingbao Frontline Communication] On July 20th, when the People's Liberation Army attacked the north city of Xushui, the infantry and artillery coordinated closely. Through focused planning and concentrated firepower, the infantry scaled the city in less than seven minutes, with no casualties among the entire demolition team. Before the start of the campaign, the artillery commander participated in senior infantry operation meetings twice to familiarize himself with the operational intentions and troop positions, in order to proactively and strategically allocate firepower. To ensure the unified use of artillery fire and flexibility in command, a joint artillery command structure was organized by the commanders of both the infantry and artillery units. On the 18th, infantry and artillery commanders jointly scouted the positions. On the afternoon of the 19th, cadres above the artillery company level and infantry cadres above the battalion level jointly held an infantry-artillery coordination meeting. Based on the characteristics of the enemy's defensive fortifications and the performance of our firepower, a rigorous three-dimensional firepower network was organized. It was determined that certain artillery would suppress obvious large enemy firepower points on the city walls, certain artillery would deal with the firing from bunkers below the city, certain artillery would cooperate in attacking bunker clusters, and certain guns would seal off the middle layer loopholes on the city walls. Finally, the targets were divided into sections and assigned to each unit, and each unit then numbered the targets within its section, so that each element of firepower had specific responsibilities. On the afternoon of the same day, cadres from both sides clearly stipulated the specific steps of the shooting. On the 20th, as the battle was about to begin, both sides conducted friendly supervision and inspection. The infantry checked the artillery's firing preparations and firing procedures; the artillery checked the infantry's charge preparations, ditch-crossing preparations, and city-scaling equipment. Due to the good cooperation between the two sides and thorough preparations, the city-scaling work proceeded very smoothly. When the signal for the general attack was issued, light and heavy artillery and heavy machine guns roared together, and the enemy's gun muzzles and loopholes all became silent. The brave demolition team members leaped over the stone bridge as if flying, and with a deafening roar, the demolition was successful, with no casualties to themselves. As a cloud of thick smoke dissipated, our heroic assault team, under the accurate cover of our artillery fire, had already occupied the top of the city.

    步炮协同密切配合
    统一计划互相督促检查
    压住敌人火力顺利登城
    【平保前线通讯】七月廿日，解放军攻击徐水北城时，步炮协同，做到专心计划，集中火力，不到七分钟，步兵登城，全体爆破队，无一伤亡。战役开始前，炮兵指挥员，两次参加步兵高级作战会议，熟习作战意图，和兵力位置，以便主动的、有重点的配备火力。为了炮火的统一使用，和指挥上的灵活，又由步炮两部队的指挥员共同组织了炮兵的联合指挥机构。十八日，步炮指挥员共同侦察阵地。十九日下午，炮兵连以上干部，步兵营以上干部，共同召开步炮协同会议，根据敌人防御工事的特点，和我们火力的性能，组织了严密的立体火力网。确定某种炮压住敌人城墙上明显的大的火力点，某种炮对付城下地堡之射击，某种炮配合合击地堡群，某种枪封锁城墙上中层枪眼，最后又把目标分段划给各单位，各单位再把本段的目标编成号，使各个火力、各负专责。同日下午，双方干部又在一起明确的规定了射击的具体步骤。二十日，战斗快要打响了，双方又进行友谊的督促检查。步兵检查炮兵的射击准备，射击程序；炮兵检查步兵的冲锋准备，过沟准备，登城工具等。由于两下配合的好，准备工作充分，致登城工作非常顺利。当总攻讯号发出以后，轻重炮和重机枪一齐狂叫，敌人的枪口枪眼，全成了哑吧；勇敢的爆炸队员们，飞也似的跃过石桥，一声轰然巨响，爆破成功了，自己无一伤亡。一片浓烟散开，我们英勇的突击队员们，在我们准确的炮火掩护下，已经盘踞于城头之上。
