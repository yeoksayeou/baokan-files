【Taiyue Telegram】The Yangcheng Fourth District Party Committee and District Government have deeply and promptly led the masses in production. Currently, more than 41,000 mu of millet, sesame, cotton, etc., in the entire district have begun their second weeding, and 12,000 mu of corn have been weeded twice. To strengthen production leadership, the district has established a joint-village system closely linking various villages, with each joint-village including five or six administrative villages. Each village has a working group from the district implementing grassroots leadership, reporting to the district every five days. The district can understand the situation, exchange experiences, determine policies, and deploy work in a very short time. For example, during spring plowing, although various villages had already started sowing, many people doubted the Party's production and land reform policies and were not enthusiastic about production. Wang Fazhen of Feisha Village even left two mu of land unsown, without applying fertilizer or even planting seeds. The district government discovered this situation and immediately proposed "Whoever plants it, harvests it, and the property of middle peasants will never be infringed upon," reversing the thinking of these people. With the arrival of each season, slogans are put forward based on the needs and demands of the masses. For example, during weeding, the slogan "One inch of weeding for millet is better than applying fertilizer" was put forward to mobilize and organize the masses to take action. The district committee and government not only put forward slogans and made arrangements but also promptly conducted in-depth organization and inspection. Comrade Wang Guolin, the district head, said: "To thoroughly check land reform, we must go to the fields to lead production." They not only went to the large fields by the main road to check, but also to the mountain gullies. When District Head Wang Guolin went to Suzhuang to check the first weeding, he walked along the mountain slopes and gullies and found that Zhang Fusheng's more than one mu of millet in Zhangjia Village had not been weeded, and the grass was very high. After discovering this, in addition to immediately correcting it, they also notified the joint-village working groups and joint-village cadres to go to the fields for inspection. After the last rain, Comrade Wang Guolin quickly went to the fields to see how deep the rainwater was. At the same time, he also learned that the masses were worried that they would not be able to grow crops after planting. He led all the cadres to persuade and mobilize the masses to rush to plant, and notified all villages to stop transporting public grain. Starting from the 12th, nearly 20,000 mu of land was rushed to be planted in five days, and on the 17th, there was a thorough rain, and the seedlings all took root.

　　阳城四区干部领导生产深入及时
    【太岳电】阳城四区区委与区政府深入及时领导群众生产，现全区四万一千多亩谷子、芝麻、棉花等已开始锄二遍，一万二千多亩玉茭已锄二遍。该区为加强生产领导，建立了密切联系各村的联村制度，每个联村包括五、六个行政村。各乡村都有区上的工作组实行基点领导，五天向区汇报一次。区上能在很短时间内了解情况，交流经验，决定方针和布置工作。如春耕时各村虽已开始下种，但有不少人对党的生产与土改政策怀疑，生产不起劲，沸沙村王发珍甚至空种了二亩地，不但没上粪，连籽也没下。区政府发现了这种情况，立时提出“谁种谁收，中农财产坚决不侵犯”，扭转了这些人的思想。每个季节到来时，便根据群众的需要和要求提出口号，如锄苗时提出：“谷锄一寸，强如上粪。”动员组织群众行动起来。区委和政府不光提出口号，作了布置，还及时的深入组织检查。区长王国霖同志说：“检查翻身要到家，领导生产要下地。”他们不光到大道边大块地里去检查，还到山沟圪塔里检查。区长王国霖去苏庄检查锄头遍苗时就走的山坡沟凹，检查出张家庄张富生的一亩多谷子还没锄过，草长的很高。发现后除立刻纠正外，还通知各联村工作组和联村干部也都深入到地里去检查。上次下雨后，王国霖同志赶快去地里看雨水多深，同时又了解了群众有顾虑，怕种上出不来，他便领导全体干部一面说服动员群众抢种，一面通知各村停运公粮，从十二日开始，五天就把近二万亩地抢种完了，十七日就下了一场透雨，苗都捉住了。
