    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: Free Greece Radio broadcast: The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party held its Fourth Plenary Session on July 28th in the Grammos Mountains in northwestern Greece. Markos delivered a report on the military and political situation and the current tasks of the Greek Communist Party. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution stating that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Greek Communist Party Central Committee was held in Grammos at a time when the righteous democratic army was victoriously waging the greatest and most historically significant struggle for the freedom, democracy, and independence of Greece in northern Pindus. In the fierce battles in northern Pindus, the democratic army victoriously resisted and annihilated the enemy, who had superior forces and received modern weapons and equipment from the Anglo-American imperialists. The struggle in northern Pindus proved that the strength of the Greek people and the Greek democratic army is powerful and unconquerable. It also shows that all opportunists and surrenderists who kneel before the enemy are despicable traitors to the nation and will delay the liberation of Greece and allow the royalist fascists to continue to plague Greece and destroy the people. The resolution pointed out that the royalist fascist army, after its defeat in northern Pindus, showed signs of war-weariness and demoralization.

    希共中央举行四次全会
    【新华社陕北八日电】自由希腊电台广播：希腊共产党中央委员会于七月二十八日在希腊西北部的格拉姆斯山区举行第四次全会。马科斯在会上作了关于军事与政治形势以及希共当前任务的报告。会议一致通过决议称：希共中央第四次全会之在格拉姆斯举行，是正当民主军在平都斯北部为希腊的自由、民主与独立胜利地进行着最伟大的有历史意义的斗争之时。在平都斯北部的激烈战斗中，民主军胜利地抵抗与歼灭兵力占优势并从美英帝国主义者方面得到现代武器与装备的敌人。平都斯北部的斗争，证明了希腊人民与希腊民主军的力量是强大的和不可被征服的。这也说明所有在敌人面前屈膝的机会主义者们和投降主义者们，是对国家民族卑鄙的变节，将延迟希腊的解放，并将使保皇法西斯得以继续祸害希腊与毁灭人民。决议指出，保皇法西斯军队在平都斯北部失败以后，表现了厌战与士气沮丧的征象。
