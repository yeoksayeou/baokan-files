　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st—The Labor Conference listened to Zhu Xuefan’s report on the worker’s movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and a supplementary report from Shanghai representatives on the heroic struggle of Shanghai workers over the past two years on the 10th and 11th. These two reports detailed the heroic struggles of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, arousing the highest respect from the attending representatives for their worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. A unanimous resolution was passed for all workers in the liberated areas to do one day of voluntary labor to aid their patriotic struggle.

　　Zhu Xuefan's report was divided into five parts: 1. The current goals of the struggle of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas; 2. How the Kuomintang reactionaries murder and control the masses of workers; 3. The tragic state of life of workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas; 4. The heroic struggle of the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas against American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; 5. The struggle of the China Labor Association for the democratic unity and human rights protection of the national working class.

　　Li Lisan followed the two reports with a brief speech. He expressed his respect and condolences to the workers' movement activists and workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially the Shanghai workers with the glorious traditions of the May 30th Movement and the three armed uprisings. He pointed out that this heroic struggle demonstrates the Chinese working class's heroic, unyielding, and persistent spirit of struggle. He called on the national working class to unite closely, unite with all oppressed people, and do their best to support the Liberation War to win victory sooner. Li Lisan emphasized that the workers in the liberated areas, after hearing these two reports, can more profoundly feel that only the liberated areas are free, happy, and democratic paradises, where workers have become masters of society and the country. These are precisely the goals for which workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are sacrificing blood and fighting heroically today. He asked the worker representatives of the liberated areas to widely and deeply convey these two reports to the workers of the liberated areas, so that everyone knows the deep suffering of their class brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and will work harder in production to support the war. He said: "The more work we do, the more effort we make, the faster the people in the Kuomintang areas can be liberated. This is the obligation and responsibility that workers in the liberated areas should fulfill!"

　　Following this, the conference unanimously approved the suggestion proposed by the Northeast delegation that all workers in the liberated areas increase voluntary labor by one day, and use their wages as a fund to aid the struggle of workers and people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

　　Tang Guifen of the Shanghai delegation then stood up to speak on behalf of the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. She said excitedly: "The soldiers and civilians and workers of the liberated areas, after ten years of civil war, eight years of the War of Resistance, and two years of the Liberation War, have fought hard, shed blood, and sacrificed, and today they still want to help us. I really don't know what to say to thank you! I will definitely bring the conference's resolution back to encourage the workers there even more. I believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to persevere in the struggle until the final victory!" Her words were drowned out by slogans such as "Attack Nanjing!" "Attack Shanghai!" and so on from the entire audience.

　　听取国民党统治区职工斗争事迹报告
  　劳大代表致崇高慰问
    解放区职工决增加义务工一天支援阶级兄弟
    【新华社东北二十一日电】劳动大会于十日、十一日听取朱学范关于国民党统治区职工运动的报告及上海代表关于上海工人两年多来的英勇斗争的补充报告。该两报告详细的说明了国民党统治区工人的英勇的斗争，引起到会代表对国民党统治区工人兄弟极高的崇敬，并一致决议全解放区职工做义务工一日，以援助他们的爱国斗争。
    朱学范的报告共分五部分：一、国民党统治区职工目前奋斗的目标；二、国民党反动派怎样杀害、控制工人群众；三、国民党统治区工人生活的悲惨状态；四、国民党统治区工人阶级反对美帝国主义及国民党反动派的英勇斗争；五、中国劳动协会为全国工人阶级的民主团结与人权保障的斗争。
    李立三于该两报告后，继起作简短发言。他对国民党统治区职工运动者及工人特别是有着五卅运动和三次武装起义光荣传统的上海工人的斗争，表示崇敬与慰问，指出这种英勇斗争，正表现了中国工人阶级英勇不屈、斗争到底的顽强精神，号召全国工人阶级紧密团结，联合一切被压迫人民，尽力支援解放战争，争取胜利的更早到来。立三强调指出，解放区的职工们听了这两个报告，可以更深刻地感觉到只有解放区才是自由幸福民主的乐园，工人已经作了社会国家的主人，这些正是今天国民党统治区工人牺牲流血英勇奋斗的目标。他要求解放区职工代表们要把这两个报告广泛深入地传达给解放区的工人，让大家知道国民党统治区阶级兄弟痛苦的深重，更加紧生产，支援战争。他说：“我们多做一点工，多努一把力，便能使国民党区的人民更快解放，这是我们解放区职工应尽的义务和责任！”
    接着大会一致通过了东北代表团所提关于全解放区职工增加义务工一天，以其工资作为援助国民党统治区工人及人民斗争基金的建议。
    上海代表团汤桂芬继代表国民党统治区工人起立讲话，她激动地说：“解放区军民与职工，经过了十年内战、八年抗战、两年解放战争，艰苦奋战流血牺牲，今天还要援助我们，我真不知用什么话来答谢才好！我一定把大会的决议带回去，让那里的工人更加鼓舞起来。我相信在毛主席的领导下，我们一定能把斗争坚持下去，直到最后胜利！”她的话未完就被全场“打到南京去！”“打到上海去！”等等口号所淹没了。
