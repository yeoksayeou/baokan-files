　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Agence France-Presse revealed that Viet Minh guerrillas were "intensely active in Hanoi" on the night of the 6th. "Hand grenades exploded in many areas of the city," including the French military headquarters, which was also attacked. A police station near the Hanoi train station was attacked. A French outpost on the southern border of Hanoi was attacked by mortars. 16 miles from Hanoi, Viet Minh forces removed a section of railway track, delaying a train to Haiphong by two hours. On the 2nd, Viet Minh forces attacked the French defense line on the road from Bac Kan (transliteration) to Cao Bang, north of Hanoi, and at one point stormed into the houses defended by the French "Foreign Legion," inflicting 40 casualties on the French. On the 7th, a convoy of military vehicles heading to Rach Gia, southwest of Saigon, was ambushed by Viet Minh forces 200 kilometers west of Saigon. The military convoy escort suffered heavy casualties, and the Viet Minh attacking forces captured an 8.8 cm caliber gun. Prior to this, on July 31st, a French truck convoy was attacked at the border between Koh Pong Ching and Xin Lap in central Cambodia, and two trucks were destroyed. As the Viet Minh forces become increasingly active, according to a report by the Telegraph Agency of India, the French military headquarters in Vietnam announced that foreign journalists would not be allowed to send uncensored telegrams. Journalists could only base their reports on official French military communiqués, without alteration or commentary. The French military's censorship of telegrams and its use of Nazi elements to organize the "Foreign Legion" to deal with the Vietnamese people have aroused dissatisfaction among a broad section of French society.

　　伏击，破路，袭击法军
  　越盟军游击队活跃河内西贡
    【新华社陕北十三日电】法新社透露：越盟游击队于六日夜晚，曾“在河内紧张活动”。“城内许多地区都有手榴弹爆炸”，法军司令部也在被投弹之列。河内车站附近一警察局遭受袭击。河内南部边界上法军哨岗受到一场迫击炮的袭击。在距河内十六里地方，越盟军拆去铁轨一段，使开往海防的火车延迟两小时。二日，越盟军曾袭击河内以北巴干（译音）到高平路上的法军警戒线，并一度冲入法军“外籍军团”所防守的房屋内，法军死伤四十名。七日，赴西贡西南拉赤加的一队军车，在西贡以西二百公里处，遭到越盟军的伏击，军车护送队有很大伤亡，越盟攻击军已缴获一门口径八点八公分的炮。前此，七月三十一日，在柬埔寨中部之科邦清与新拉普两地区的交界处，法卡车队被袭，卡车两辆被毁。在越盟军日趋活跃之时，据电通社报导，越南法军司令部宣布：外国记者将不得发出未经检查的电讯，记者仅能以法军官方公报为根据，不得更改，也不得评论。法军检查电讯以及任用纳粹分子组织“外籍军团”来对付越南人民的行为，已引起法国广大社会人士的不满。
