Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st Dispatch: Siping Street, liberated for more than four months, is seeing vigorous progress in various construction efforts. After the city's liberation, the democratic government resolutely implemented policies to protect industry and commerce, abolished all the Kuomintang government's exorbitant taxes, and implemented a unified business tax. To take into account the severe damage suffered by industry and commerce under Kuomintang rule, the business tax of 500 million yuan for the first half of the year was waived. In addition, loans of 150 million yuan were issued to help them quickly recover and to encourage development. Furthermore, the democratic government worked hard to restore transportation and electricity supply, striving to provide industry and commerce with convenient conditions for recovery and development. As a result, industry and commerce have developed extremely rapidly in the past four months. Currently, there are a total of 1,654 industrial and commercial enterprises in the city, an increase of 23% compared to the peak of 1,300 during the Kuomintang rule. Among them, there are 23 private mechanical factories, a threefold increase compared to the Japanese puppet regime. In terms of school education, in addition to merging the original secondary schools to establish Liaobei Provincial Tenth Middle School, the city has also restored a midwifery school and more than ten primary schools, and founded Liaobei College and Liaobei Military Region Health College. Currently, there are more than 6,400 students in the city. Significant achievements have also been made in municipal construction. The transportation, postal services, and the supply of water and electricity have been restored and protected. After the railway was repaired on May 3, the coal supply became smooth, and the city's fuel problem was completely solved. Tap water has also been restored for a long time, with a daily supply of 180 tons. The expansion and repair of water and electricity equipment are continuing.

    帮助工商业恢复元气
    【新华社东北一日电】解放四个多月的四平街，各种建设工作蒸蒸日上。该市解放后，民主政府即坚决执行保护工商业政策，废除国民党政府一切苛捐杂税，实行统一营业税。为照顾工商业受国民党统治摧残过重，并免征本年度上半年营业税额五亿元，另贷款一亿五千万元，以帮助迅速恢复元气，和鼓励发展。此外，民主政府又努力恢复交通和电力供应，尽量使工商业获得恢复和发展的便利条件。因此四个多月来，工商业发展极为迅速。目前全市已共有工商业一千六百五十四户，较国民党统治时最盛时期的一千三百户还增加百分之二十三。其中私营机械工厂共有二十三户，较伪满时增加了三倍。学校教育，该市除合并原有各中学成立辽北省立第十中学外，并恢复助产学校一所及小学十余所，创办辽北学院及辽北军区卫生学院各一所。现全市学生共有六千四百余名。市政建设也有很大成绩。恢复了交通邮电和保护了水电的供应。五月三日修复铁路后，煤源畅通，全市燃料问题完全解决。自来水也早已恢复，每日送水量一百八十吨。现正继续扩大与修复水电设备中。
