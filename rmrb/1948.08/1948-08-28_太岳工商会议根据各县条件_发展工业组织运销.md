　　【Taiyue Electric Dispatch】The Taiyue Industrial and Commercial Bureau convened a conference of bureau chiefs from various districts and counties from July 9th to August 14th to thoroughly review the industrial and commercial work of the past year. The conference pointed out that after correcting the past mistake of simply emphasizing fiscal revenue and neglecting the active development of production, and especially after clearing up the thought of unilaterally emphasizing the interests of the poor and correcting deviations such as infringing on industry and commerce this spring, markets in all areas of the region have developed more than before. Anze County added 125 new industrial and commercial businesses; Baodian Town in Changzi County added 16; Guodao in Qinyuan County increased by 8; Qinshui County increased by 20; Qin County increased by 12; Jincheng County increased by 40; and in Yangcheng County, Shizi Street alone added 23. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Anze and Changzi, 273 new industrial and commercial businesses were opened. The meeting criticized two erroneous practices: one was that the Gaoping County Bureau, in order to increase fiscal revenue, arbitrarily increased the industrial and commercial tax by 5 million yuan, which hindered the normal development of industry and commerce in the county; the other was that the third and fourth districts neglected the economic struggle against Chiang Kai-shek and the US, did not implement the resolutions of the Border Region Financial and Economic Conference, and allowed large quantities of Chiang Kai-shek and US paints and cigarettes to enter, which greatly impacted the liberated area's cigarette industry and local indigo production. The conference determined that the main task of industrial and commercial work in the future is to develop industrial production based on the specific conditions of each county. It was decided that Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qinshui and other counties would focus on restoring and developing the iron industry, and iron goods stores would be established in Jiyuan (or Meng County) and Yicheng County to specialize in the transportation and sale of iron goods. It is also planned to hold an iron industry conference in September. Yuanqu County and Baodian Town in Changzi County should restore medicinal material shops to promote local products and absorb Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials. Changzi and Qinyuan County will develop hemp businesses, Gaoping County will restore silk businesses, and Jiangxian Nanfan and other places will restore flower and grain businesses. Businesses are allowed to set their own handling fees (reporting to the Industrial and Commercial Bureau for record). In terms of labor-capital and employer-employee relations, both labor and capital are allowed to freely hire, and both parties can freely negotiate contracts. In order to facilitate product sales, it was decided to repair roads and bridges (especially the Qin River Bridge), develop organized transportation, and develop roadside shops. Larger towns such as Jincheng can establish credit transportation cooperatives to facilitate the transportation of goods by merchants.

　　太岳工商会议根据各县条件
  　发展工业组织运销
    【太岳电】太岳工商管理局于七月九日至八月十四日召开各分区县局长会议，详细检讨一年以来的工商工作。会上指出在纠正了过去单纯强调财政收入，忽视积极发展生产的错误，特别是今春清算了片面强调雇贫利益的思想，纠正了侵犯工商业等偏向后，全区各地市场都较前发展。安泽新增工商业一百廿五家；长子鲍店镇新增十六家；沁源郭道增加八家；沁水增二十家；沁县增十二家；晋城增四十家；阳城只十字街就增加了二十三家。据安泽、长子等七个县不完全统计，新开办了工商业二百七十三家。会上批评了两种错误做法：一是高平县局为增加财政收入，擅自加派五百万元工商税款，以致妨碍了该县工商业正常发展；一是三、四分区，忽略对蒋美的经济斗争，不执行边区财经会议决议，允许蒋美颜料、纸烟大量入口，使解放区卷烟业和土靛受到很大打击。会议确定了今后工商工作主要的任务是根据各县具体条件，发展工业生产。决定晋城、阳城、沁水等县以恢复发展铁业为主，济源（或孟县）、翼城设立铁货行，专门运销铁货。并拟于九月召开铁业会议。垣曲和长子鲍店镇要恢复药材行，推销土货，吸收川广药材。长子、沁源发展麻行，高平恢复丝行；绛县南樊等地恢复花行、粮行。允许行店自订手续费（报工商局备案）。在劳资东伙关系上，允许劳资双方雇用自由，劳资双方自订合同契约。为便利产品推销，决定修路、修桥（特别是沁河桥），发展组织运输，发展路上店房。晋城等较大城镇，可建立信用运输合作社，便利客商运货。
