Under the Tyranny of the閻 Faction

"Combining Soldiers and Farmers" Kills People, Families Ruined, and Ghosts Blow Out the Lamps

[Taihang News] The Yuci, Taigu, Qi County, Pingyao, and Jiexiu counties in central Shanxi, known as the "Golden Plains," were once prosperous in commerce and agriculture. In particular, the commercial investments of Taigu and Qi County extended to major cities across the country. However, under the brutal rule of the閻 faction's "combining soldiers and farmers" policy, the people of central Shanxi have suffered unprecedented devastation. The following are some excerpts:

The閻 faction used every kind of torture to instill anti-communist and anti-people poison. Wu Jicai, a soldier of the Second Company, First Battalion, Second Regiment of the captured 46th Division, had the words "Oppose Communism" tattooed on his arm with needles. Wu said that in the閻 faction's "Self-Confession and Rebirth" movement, they used "disguise" and "suspicion" as pretexts to beat over a thousand innocent people to death with clubs in the Fenyang area alone. The special agents "Iron Army Cadres" in the閻 faction's army also frequently disregarded human life under the guise of "disguise and suspicion." Chen Deping, a liberated soldier, witnessed a soldier being beaten to death with clubs by the "Iron Army Cadres" in front of the entire battalion simply because he expressed dissatisfaction with "combining soldiers and farmers" when pointing at a portrait of閻 Xi-shan. Therefore, the soldiers in the閻 army widely circulated the saying of "Four Deaths": "Death on the battlefield, death from starvation, death from neglect of illness, and death from saying the wrong word."

The rural people under the閻 faction's brutal exploitation of "combining soldiers and farmers" experienced even more miserable scenes. Cao Zhanshan, a middle peasant in Wangxian Village, Second District, Qi County, harvested three piculs of millet, two dou of mung beans, four dou of foxtail millet, and thirty-five jin of sesame last autumn. Under the閻 faction's heavy and harsh demands, he was robbed of 138.5 jin of millet, 194 jin of sorghum, 36 jin of soybeans, 59 jin of mung beans, 41.5 jin of foxtail millet, 30 taels of sesame, and 79 jin of horse feed, totaling 578 jin and 10 taels. He was also ordered to make eight pairs of military shoes. Guo Peifu, the head of Rongren Fort, was forced to jump into a well in the first month of this year because he could not afford the grain.

Under the閻 faction's inhumane atrocities, people's lives were not guaranteed, creating a terrifying atmosphere of fear in the閻 occupied areas. Two "Self-Defense Army" members with the surname Hao in Qicun Village, Qi County, were beheaded by the閻 faction for "dereliction of duty" while guarding the road, and their ears were strung with iron wire and hung on telegraph poles as a warning. Last December, six people were beaten to death with clubs on the spot at a "Self-Confession and Rebirth" meeting held in Qicun Village, Quanxia Township. After Wu Si'er of Yantaigou, Second District, Qi County, was beaten to death, the enemy immediately dug out and ate his heart and lungs. Wu's sixty-year-old mother, having lost her means of support, also committed suicide by jumping into a well. In this "Self-Confession and Rebirth" campaign, more than 170 people were "reborn" to death in Qi County alone. As a result, the masses left their homes and fled, causing most of the land to be deserted and overgrown with weeds. Nanya, Sunjiahe, Shangyancan, Rencun, Nanjian'an, and Beijian'an villages in Qi County have always been rich in wheat production, and the masses have long called them "Wheat Forts," with wheat planting accounting for more than one-half of the land each year. In recent years, this has gradually decreased to less than one-fifth. Of the 2,232.6 mu of land in Shangyancan, 471 mu were planted with wheat, while 1,323.6 mu were wasteland.

A folk song is circulating among the masses in the閻 occupied areas: "Combining soldiers and farmers is really fierce, the youth are drafted into the army, the old and young at home suffer torture, the fields are barren and bury people." The masses also have a popular folk song about the閻 faction's "combining soldiers and farmers," which they call a "treasure bowl": "Combining soldiers and farmers is a treasure bowl, families ruined, and ghosts blow out the lamps." This is a true portrayal of the閻 faction's bloody rule by the people of central Shanxi.

    在阎匪暴政下
    “兵农合一”害死人
    家破人亡鬼吹灯
    【太行讯】晋中平川的榆（次）太（谷）祁（县）平（遥）介（休）等县素有“金不换”之称，商业繁荣，农业富庶，特别是太谷祁县的商业投资几遍及全国各大都市。但近来在阎匪“兵农合一”暴政统治下，晋中人民遭到了空前的洗劫。下面是一些片断的材料：阎匪为贯输反共反人民的毒素，曾用尽各种非刑。被俘四十六师二团一营二连士兵吴吉才的臂膀上即用针刺“反共”二字。吴说：阎匪在“自白转生”运动中，以“伪装”“嫌疑”为罪名，仅在汾阳一带即以乱棍打死一千多无辜人民。阎匪军中的特务“铁军基干”亦经常以“伪装嫌疑”草菅人命，解放战士陈德平即目睹一士兵因指着阎逆像片不满“兵农合一”，被“铁军基干”集合全营用乱棍处死。因此阎军士兵中普遍流行着“战场上打死，吃不饱饿死，有病不看不管害死，说错了一句话打死”的四死。在阎匪“兵农合一”苛征暴＠①下的农村人民，更显现出苦难的惨景。祁县二区王贤村中农曹占山，去秋收粮为三石谷子、两斗绿豆、四斗糜子和三十五斤芝麻，在阎匪繁苛的攫夺下，被夺小米一百三十八斤半、谷子一百九十四斤，黄豆三十六斤、绿豆五十九斤，糜子四十一斤半、芝麻三十斤十两、马料七十九斤，共五百七十八斤十两，并派做军鞋八双。荣任堡郭培富，因出不起粮于今年正月被逼跳井。在阎匪灭绝人性的暴行下，民命不保，造成阎占区人人自危的恐怖境地，祁县祁村两个姓郝的“自卫军”，因看路“失职”被阎匪杀头，用铁丝串住耳朵高挂电线杆上示众。去年腊月全下申乡在祁村开“自白转生”会，有六个人当场被乱棍打死。祁县二区元台沟吴四儿被乱棍打死后，敌人当即挖吃其心腑，吴之六十岁老母因失生活依靠，亦投井自杀。此次“自白转生”祁县共“转”死一百七十多人。因此群众背乡离井纷纷逃亡，致使大部土地荒芜，蓬蒿成林。祁县南崖、孙家河、上阎灿、任村、南北建安等村一向产麦甚富，群众素称“麦屯子”，每年种麦占土地二分之一以上，近年来已逐渐减至五分之一以下。上阎灿二千二百三十二亩六分地，种麦四百七十一亩，荒地则有一千三百二十三亩六分。阎占区群众流行着一种民谣：“兵农合一真是凶，青年编组抽了兵，家中老小受苦刑，地里荒芜埋住人。”群众对阎匪“兵农合一”自称为“聚宝盆”也有一首普传的民谣：“兵农合一聚宝盆，家破人亡鬼吹灯。”这是晋中人民对阎匪血腥统治的真实写照。
