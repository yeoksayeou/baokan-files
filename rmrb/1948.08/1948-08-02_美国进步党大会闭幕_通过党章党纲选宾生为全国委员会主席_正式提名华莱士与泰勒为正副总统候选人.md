    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Reports from various sources: The newly formed US Progressive Party convention concluded on the 25th, after completing its agenda in three days. The 25th's session discussed and adopted the new party's program. American journalist Anna Louise Strong spoke during the program's discussion, stating: She believed the program should strongly condemn the US policy towards China. She said: Chiang Kai-shek's troops are shooting women and children, and the Chinese people already see the United States as the place where bombs and bullets are made to massacre their women and children. Black singer Paul Robeson stated in his speech: The United States has become a bastion of reaction today. During the discussion, a representative from Vermont, Hayford, proposed a so-called foreign policy amendment, requesting it be included in the party program. The original text of the amendment was: "Although we criticize American foreign policy, we do not wish to completely endorse any country's foreign policy." The proposer of this amendment attempted to "indirectly express that the new party does not support the Soviet Union's foreign policy," but supporters of this amendment were in the extreme minority. The convention then formally adopted the draft program proposed by the Program Committee amidst loud cheers from the delegates. The convention finally elected the leaders of the Progressive Party's National Committee. As a result of the election, former Minnesota Governor and supporter of Wallace's campaign, Bensen, was elected Chairman of the new party's National Committee. Black leader and singer Paul Robeson, and the president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, James FitzGerald, were elected as Vice-Chairmen. Former Wallace campaign director, Paul J. Salinger, was elected as Secretary and will continue to serve as campaign director. The convention then closed amidst enthusiastic cheers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Reports from various sources: On the second day (24th) of the US Progressive Party convention, Wallace and Taylor were formally nominated as the new party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates by voice vote. Following heated discussions, the convention adopted the party constitution, the preamble of which stipulates the new party's purpose as: The new party will be dedicated to "obtaining peace, freedom, and prosperity for the American people; opposing the control of our economy and the control of the government through the two old Democratic and Republican parties by a few financial and industrial groups. They are driving our country into economic depression, fascism, and war. We declare: Our goal is to break through this monopoly's clutches and rebuild a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. We welcome all Americans who agree with this goal to join our ranks, without hindering full and equal participation due to race, belief, color, gender, or ancestry" (TASS). The party constitution also stipulates that the new party will hold a national congress once a year, and the National Committee will meet every four months.
    That evening, the convention held a rally at "Civic" Park Plaza to hear Wallace and Taylor's acceptance speeches. Although attendees had to pay admission tickets ranging from sixty cents to two dollars and fifty cents, nearly 35,000 people attended the rally, and the "brightly lit park" immediately "triggered a lively demonstration" (see Associated Press). In his speech, Wallace emphasized the goals of the new party and vehemently criticized the Republican and Democratic parties for sacrificing the people's interests to benefit big businesses. He proposed that US troops should withdraw from Berlin, shouting that the US policy in Berlin was "a product of lust for power and lust for profit." At this point, "cheers shook the entire park" (Associated Press). Both Wallace and Taylor's speeches insisted on the possibility and necessity of cooperation with the Soviet Union. When Taylor mentioned Truman, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Republican presidential candidate Dewey, and his foreign policy advisor Dulles, the masses scoffed at these representatives of reactionaries. Wallace and Taylor's speeches were constantly interrupted by thunderous applause from the audience. The convention expressed its support for Wallace as a presidential candidate with shouts of "We want Wallace - We want peace!" American Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio also addressed the convention, pointing out that reactionaries "are attempting to undermine us with intimidation and accusations of communism. We recognize that defending communists is the first line of defense for democracy." Black leader Robeson followed Marcantonio, pointing out that the new party must fight for the complete destruction of fascism. The convention will conclude on the 25th after adopting the party program and electing the National Committee.

    美国进步党大会闭幕
    通过党章党纲选宾生为全国委员会主席
    正式提名华莱士与泰勒为正副总统候选人
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】各方报导：新成立的美国进步党大会，在三天会议完成大会的议程后已于二十五日闭幕。二十五日的会议讨论并通过了新党的党纲。美名记者斯特朗女士在讨论党纲时发言称：她相信党纲应强烈地谴责美国对华政策。她说：蒋介石的军队枪杀妇女儿童，中国人民已将美国看作是制造屠杀他们妇女儿童炸弹与枪弹的地方。黑人歌王罗伯逊发言提出：美国今日已变成反动的堡垒。在讨论中，佛蒙特州代表海福德提出所谓外交政策修正案一件，并要求将其载入党纲中。该修正案的原文为：“我们虽批评美国外交政策，但并不欲完全赞同任何国家的外交政策”。这一修正案的提案人企图以此来“间接表示新党并不支持苏联的外交政策”，但这一修正案的支持者只占极少数。大会继即在各代表高喊拥护声中，正式通过党纲委员会所提出的党纲草案。大会最后选举进步党全国委员会的负责人，选举结果，前明尼苏达州州长与拥护华莱士竞选全国委员会主席宾生当选为新党全国委员会主席，黑人领袖与歌王罗伯逊及产联电气工人工会主席费兹吉拉德两人当选为副主席，前华莱士竞选运动主任鲍尔温当选为秘书，并仍兼竞选运动主任。大会随即在热烈欢呼声中闭幕。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方报导：美国进步党大会第二日（二十四日）以口头表决方式，正式通过提名华莱士与泰勒为新党的正副总统候选人。大会继之在热烈讨论后，通过了党章，其中序言部分规定新党的目的称：新党将致力于“获取美国人民和平、自由与富足；反对少数财政与工业集团控制我们的经济和通过民主共和两个老政党控制政府。它们正将我国驱入经济萧条、法西斯主义与战争之中。我们宣布：我们的目标是要冲破这种垄断的魔掌，重建民有、民治与民享的政府。我们欢迎一切赞同这一目标的美国人参加我们的队伍，不因种族、信仰、肤色、性别或血统而妨碍充分与平等的参加”（塔斯社）。党章同时规定新党每年召开全国代表大会一次，全国委员会每四月召开一次。
    当日晚，大会假“席比”公园广场听取华莱士与泰勒接受提名的演说。虽然入场者每人须付六角至二元五角的门票，但参加大会者将近三万五千人，“灯光辉煌的公园”顿时“触发了一场热闹的示威”（见美联社）。华莱士在演说中强调指出新党的目标，并痛斥共和与民主两党之牺牲人民以为大企业者谋利益。他提议美军应退出柏林，高呼美国在柏林所奉行的政策，乃是“权力欲与利润欲的产物”。这时“喝采声震动了整个公园”（美联社）。华莱士与泰勒的演说均坚持与苏联合作的可能性与必要性。当泰勒提及杜鲁门、国防部长福莱斯特尔、共和党总统候选人杜威与其外交顾问杜勒斯时，群众均对这些反动派的代表嗤之以鼻。华莱士与泰勒的演说不断的为听众雷动的欢呼所打断。大会以“我们要华莱士——我们要和平！”的高呼表示拥护通过华莱士为总统候选人。美劳工党议员马肯托尼奥亦向大会发表演说，指出反动派“企图以恫吓和控告共产党人来破坏我们。我们认识到保卫共产党人即是保卫民主的第一道防线”。黑人领袖罗伯逊继马氏之后，指出新党必须为完全摧毁法西斯主义而斗争。大会将于二十五日通过党纲及选举全国委员会后闭幕。
