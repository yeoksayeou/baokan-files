Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong, 9th. The discipline and policies of the People's Liberation Army have been widely supported and praised by the people of Jinzhong. The situation in Qixian County is one example.

　　When our army approached the outskirts of Qixian County in early July, landlords who had fled in the past took advantage of the panic of Yan's troops near Qixian County and returned to their homes, which had just been liberated. When asked why they returned, they said, "We heard about your policies in the spring, but the enemy's restrictions were too strict, and we couldn't leave." It turned out that they had long heard about the various facts of our army implementing policies when liberating Linfen, Quwo, and other cities. They said, "We all know that you protect industry and commerce and don't kill people, so everyone feels at ease." Before the attack on the city, some of the masses still looked at the People's Liberation Army with a past perspective, saying, "The Eighth Route Army fights guerrilla warfare and may leave at any time." On the 6th, our army began the battle of Qixian County, and that night, we captured the east and west gates of the city. On the evening of the 7th, we attacked the city and completely annihilated the defending enemy in just four hours, capturing alive Yan's 37th Provisional Division Commander Lei Yangtang and more than 3,400 other people. The masses then realized the strength of the People's Liberation Army and said happily, "Commander Lei, who was defending the city, couldn't be said to lack determination. He even 'committed suicide' (this is a new term for Yan Xishan killing his own cadres) on the first day, saying he wasn't resolute enough; the next night, in a few hours, he surrendered himself. It seems Yan Xishan is doomed."

　　After our army entered the city, the Urban Work Committee immediately entered the city to work, and the City Defense Garrison Headquarters simultaneously posted notices everywhere, stating that our army strictly implemented policies such as protecting industry and commerce and protecting culture and education. Social order in the city was quickly restored. Many people in the masses who had joined Yan Xishan's "People's Self-Defense Army" saw the notice saying: "Yan's bandits forced the people to form the People's Self-Defense Army. All those who hand over their weapons will be allowed to return home to live and work in peace, and this army and the democratic government will provide them with guarantees." They said one after another, "The Eighth Route Army understands us, I'll go call them!" With this call, four people immediately handed over a machine gun and two rifles. Our army did not hold these people accountable for the past, as long as they handed over their weapons, and protected them. The news spread, and people in Qixian, Pingyao, Qingyuan, and other counties who had sons and husbands in Yan's army burned incense and prayed to the gods to bless their sons and husbands to become prisoners of the People's Liberation Army! The democratic government announced that as long as personnel from the puppet army and puppet organizations handed over all public property and documents without destruction and registered, they would not be questioned about other matters. Here, first a registration office was set up, and later four registration offices were set up, but the people who went to register were still very crowded. Puppet organization personnel who had not registered on the first day panicked and said, "The Eighth Route Army will definitely not fail to question us." But the next day they registered and were no longer panicked. They were also very happy to make this explanation. Personnel above the rank of police chief in the police station felt very at ease hearing about the explanation. It's just that the Qixian Urban Work Committee was not firm in its execution of the point of not arresting the police, and the police chiefs were all hunted down. This is not right.

　　Yan's bandits used the "evaluation certificate" method (National Identification Card, Farmers, Businessmen and Association Certificate, Road Pass) to exercise extremely strict control over the people. Many people in Qixian City had not been able to leave the city for a step or two in the past year, and people in rural villages could not freely communicate with each other. Small traders did not dare to go out to do business. After our army arrived, the first thing was to restore the people's freedom of movement and lift various fascist bans. On the first day of opening the city, many people jumped up with joy and walked out of the city, saying, "This is a relief!" The burdens of small traders appeared everywhere. The church in Qixian, for fear that Yan's bandits would say that "disguised elements have infiltrated" the church, had not dared to hold worship services for half a year. Now, the sound of the church bells can also be heard.

　　After our army entered the city, it resolutely implemented the policy of protecting industry and commerce and stabilizing people's livelihoods. At the same time, it stipulated that within half a month, all public stores and public production organizations were only allowed to sell, not to buy. The Wuxiang County United Cooperative had rushed to buy goods in the city and was immediately stopped. Therefore, the people's hearts were greatly stabilized, and the market was stabilized, so that industry and commerce in the city could operate with peace of mind. At present, they have begun to hope that the democratic government will provide them with loans to develop their businesses. They are most concerned about how to develop in the future. All businesses that have relations with the liberated areas, such as the Quwo Tobacco Company, the Qinghua Bamboo Goods Company, and the Changzhi Yincheng Iron Goods Company, now have a way out and have no difficulty in developing. Only those who rely solely on transporting goods from Beiping, Tianjin, and Taiyuan feel that there are not many ways. In addition, industrialists, businessmen, and citizens are concerned about the issue of enemy currency disposal. They all think that "the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are in charge, there should be appropriate measures, and the people cannot be allowed to suffer." The democratic government is working on solving this problem. Some merchants mistakenly believe that we only want worker and peasant cadres, so they suspiciously say, "Can worker and peasant cadres lead business?" The general poor citizens welcome us because they know that "the Eighth Route Army will mobilize so that no one will starve to death." Therefore, there is a mentality of waiting for relief. Now, in addition to allocating food to relieve the poorest, the democratic government is actively helping them to restore and carry out production. Seeing all these correct practices after our army entered the city, a big businessman who had been in business for thirty or forty years said to our army, "You are going to win the world because you convince people with virtue!" There is a middle school in Qixian City with 400 students, plus two primary schools, with a total of about 100 faculty and staff members. They led personnel from the democratic government to inspect the school and many intact instruments, specimens, and books. The democratic government is now helping them to quickly resume classes.

　　Qixian has been revived, and everything is new. The masses all exclaimed, "I didn't expect it to be like this. Yan Xishan deceived people so miserably in the past!"

### 祁县复活了  晋中人民拥护我党政策之一例

　　祁县复活了
　　晋中人民拥护我党政策之一例
    【新华社晋中九日电】人民解放军的纪律和政策普遍地受到了晋中人民的拥护和赞叹。祁县的情形是一个例子。
    当七月初我大军逼近祁县城郊的时候，过去逃亡地主就从祁县城附近乘阎匪慌张之际，返回他们刚被解放的家园。问他们为什么回来呢，他们说：“春天就听到你们的政策定下了，只是敌人限制严，走不了。”原来他们早就听到我军解放临汾、曲沃等城时，执行政策的各种事实。他们说：“都知道了，保护工商业、不杀人，所以大家都安心。”攻城之前，有一部分群众还用过去眼光看解放军，说：“八路军是游击战，保不定那一回就走。”六日我军开始祁县之战，当晚即攻下城东西关，七日晚六时攻城，仅四小时便全歼守敌，生俘阎匪暂三十七师师长雷仰汤等三千四百余人。群众才认识了解放军的强大，高兴地说：“守城的雷师长决心不能算不大，头一天还‘自裁’（这是阎锡山杀害自己干部的新名词）了一个营长，说他不坚决；第二天晚上，几个钟头，自己就投降了，看来，阎锡山是不中了。”
    我军入城以后，城市工作委员会立即入城办公，城防卫戍司令部同时于各处张贴布告，说明我军严格执行保护工商业、保护文化教育等项政策。城内社会秩序便很快地恢复了。群众中有不少参加阎锡山“民卫军”的，他们的家属见到布告上说：“阎匪强迫人民编制之民卫军，凡交出武器者即准其回家安居乐业，本军与民主政府并予以保障”，就纷纷地说：“八路军了解咱，我去叫去！”这一叫，立即有四个人将一挺机枪两支步枪缴出。我军对于这些人，只要缴出武器，一律不咎既往，并予保护。消息传出，祁县、平遥、清源等县群众有儿子丈夫还在阎军的，家里人就烧香敬神，保佑他们的儿子丈夫能做解放军的俘虏！对伪军伪组织人员，民主政府宣布只要他们将一切公物文件不予破坏交代清楚，进行登记，便不问其他。这里先设一个登记处，后设四个登记处，前往登记的人还是拥挤得很。头一天未登记的伪组织人员，他们就慌了，说：“八路军对我们这号人一定不能不问”。但第二天他们登记了，就不恐慌了。对这交代也非常高兴。警察局警长以上人员听到办交代都非常安心。只是祁县城市工作委员会对不逮捕警察一点，执行不坚决，警察局警长都是搜捕出来的。这是不对的。
    阎匪用“评证”办法（国民身份证、兵农商会证、路证），对人民统治极严，祁县城里人民有许多人一二年来不能出城一步，乡下村庄人民，彼此也不能自由来往，小买卖人都不敢出外做生意。我军到后，头一件事就是恢复人民行动的自由，解除各种法西斯禁令。头一天开城，就有很多人高兴得跳了起来，走出城去，他们说：“这一下可舒展开啦！”小买卖人的担子到处出现了。祁县的教堂，因为怕阎匪说教堂里“混进伪装分子”，半年来不敢作礼拜。现在，教堂的钟声也可以听到了。
    我军入城以后曾坚决执行了保护工商业、安定民生的政策，同时规定半个月内凡公营商店和公家生产机关只准卖出，不准买进。武乡县联社曾在城内抢购货物，立即遭到制止。因此，大大安定了民心，稳定了市场，使城内工商业都能安心营业。目前他们已开始希望民主政府贷款给他们发展业务了。他们最关心的是今后如何发展。凡与解放区如曲沃烟行、清华竹货行、长治荫城的铁货行有关系的买卖，现在都有出路，发展无困难。只有纯粹依靠北平、天津、太原贩货的，感到办法不多，另外工商业者同市民关心的是敌币处理问题。他们都以为“共产党八路军做了主，应有适当办法，不能让老百姓吃亏。”民主政府正着手解决这个问题。商人中有的误认为我们只要工农干部，因此他们怀疑地说：“工农干部能领导作买卖吗？”一般贫苦市民都很欢迎我们，因为他们知道“八路军会动员不让饿死一个人”。因此有等待救济心理。民主政府现在除一面拨粮救济最贫苦者，正积极帮助他们恢复与进行生产。见到我军进城以后这一切正确做法，一个作了三、四十年的大买卖人曾对我军说：“你们要得天下了，因为你们是以德服人！”祁县城内有一个有四百多学生的中学也加上两个完小，教职员共约一百人，他们引着民主政府人员去巡视了学校同许多完好无损的仪器标本图书。民主政府现正在帮助他们迅速复课。
    祁县是复活了，一切在新生。群众都赞叹地说：“想不到是这个样子，过去阎锡山把人骗苦了！”
