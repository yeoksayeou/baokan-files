　　Wind and Flood Prevention, Land Conservation, and Soil Enrichment Solve People's Difficulties
　　Dingcun Afforestation Cooperation Society Achieves Great Success After Seven Years of Persistence
　　[Jizhong News] The Dingcun Afforestation Cooperation Society in Ding County has persisted for seven years and has achieved great success in wind and flood prevention, land conservation, soil enrichment, and solving the people's livelihood difficulties. During the major flood of 1939, the village's river滩地 [tāndì, river flats] were all washed away, leaving behind a layer of fine sand and mud, so nobody wanted to cultivate them. Later, the district's supply and marketing cooperative's oil mill moved to the village and started trial cultivation. In 1941, they planted six or seven *mu* of black beans and millet on the *tandi* without tilling or hoeing, and harvested over 300 *jin*, which greatly impressed the masses. The following year, Comrade Zhang Shunyu from the district cooperative and the village cadres used this example to mobilize the masses to organize the *chengtan* [成滩, lit. "becoming flats," i.e., restoring the flats] society (note: *chengtan* refers to turning barren flats into good land). One hundred and twenty-seven households joined the society. After discussion, it was decided to calculate accounts based on the amount of labor contributed. At the time, due to a lack of seeds, the method of seed-as-shares was proposed, and the masses pooled shares to solve part of the problem. The district and village cooperatives also provided some loans to the masses. Qu Laochao and Song Ruixiang, who had experience in *chengtan* and tree pressing, were elected as directors, and a bookkeeper was appointed, concurrently by a village cadre. Once organized, the masses still had concerns, including the fear of losing money and wasting labor, as well as worries about burdens and land rights. The district government, based on the then-government laws, announced that *chengtan* land would not be subject to taxation. The following year, it was announced to the masses that *chengtan* practitioners would not pay rent for fifteen years, and after fifteen years they would pay rent but would have permanent tenancy rights; those who successfully *chengtan* after being flooded three or more times would own the land. This truly enhanced the farmers' enthusiasm for整滩护滩 [zhěngtān hùtān, organizing the flats and protecting the flats], and the *chengtan* society became more consolidated year by year. Of the village's 186 households, 132 have joined the *chengtan* society. The society elects cadres annually, holds meetings when needed, plans according to the seasons, and opens the accounts for democratic discussion among the members to come up with various solutions. In the first year, the 127 members were divided into twelve groups, with every four groups forming a larger group. The entire society collectively worked on the *tandi*, with individuals counted as units, and dividends were distributed based on workdays. One big升 [shēng, a dry measure] of black bean seeds was counted as one labor share for dividends. The farmers felt that the bean shares were too high, saying that repairing the flats was not as good as doing short-term labor, and five households withdrew their shares. In the second year, the society reviewed the method of large collective *chengtan* and bean-share dividends, announced free entry and exit from the society, re-elected cadres, and democratically formulated new methods: (A) households were the shareholding unit, and groups collectively cultivated, with the society divided into twelve groups; (B) the *tandi* was divided into seventy-two blocks north to south, with each group receiving six blocks (because the soil was three *chi* thick in the west and only a plough depth in the east, each group was assigned a mix); (C) seeds were shared by the group members, and the bean-share dividend method was abolished, with distribution based entirely on labor and population, and all group members contributed equally. After the implementation of the method, everyone rushed to cultivate and harvest on time every year, taking great care in planting, and has persisted until this year.
    The trees on the *tandi* are planted in a unified plan, owned by the entire society, protected by everyone, and there is a forest protection agreement that educates and punishes theft of trees, cutting firewood, and livestock damage.
    Over the past seven years, the *chengtan* society has *chengtan* approximately 825 *mu* of land, and the current planting area is 600 *mu*. More than 32,000 trees have been planted and survived, with large trees already two hands thick and small ones over one *cun*. There are also many saplings. This has facilitated wind prevention, land conservation, flood prevention, and soil enrichment. The *tandi* can be planted with black beans, and in the first year, each workday received six to six and a half *jin*. In the second year, each workday received fifty-eight *jin*. In 1944, each household received 600 *jin*. In 1945, each household received 220 *jin*. In 1946, each household received 100 *jin*. In 1947, there was no harvest due to drought. The poor peasant Li Qishan used the distributed beans to buy a donkey, and Qu Laoying exchanged two bags of black beans for a weaving machine. Qu Baoyu's family of three survived the famine with the distributed beans, and solved the problem of firewood by cutting saplings, branches, and collecting leaves. In 1946, 80,000 *jin* of firewood were gathered, and in addition to each household receiving more than 400 *jin* of firewood, 2,000 *jin* of coarse saplings were cut and sold for 23,000 yuan (Jizhong currency, same below). In 1947, 2,000 *jin* of fine saplings were harvested and sold for 100,000 yuan, which was distributed to the members. Another 1,000 *jin* of coarse saplings were cut and are currently stored in the society. Each household also received more than 300 *jin* of firewood. Collecting leaves and bean leaves also yielded a large harvest. The achievement of these successes, in addition to the democratic and reasonable methods within the society, is mainly due to good leadership, organization, and planning. They have persisted year after year, improving every year. From the second year onwards, they made plans for planting trees and building dikes, planting trees every year and taking seedlings locally. The cultivation methods have also been improved day by day. In the first year, the land was muddy and difficult to cultivate, and only three *qing* were cultivated by manpower. From the second year onwards, this was expanded to six *qing*. The land is ploughed once and hoed once every year.
    Currently, the society still has the following problems: (1) The sandy soil of the *tandi* makes planting black beans vulnerable to drought, and the thin soil in the low-lying areas is prone to drying out. In the future, if all the *tandi* are gradually converted to planting saplings and timber, the benefits will be greater and more secure than planting beans, and it will also be beneficial for flood prevention, and the masses can also develop willow weaving; (2) The masses lack willow weaving technology and request the county and district to help find someone to teach them.

### 防风防水淤地护地解决群众困难　丁村成滩造林合作社坚持七年有很大成绩

　　防风防水淤地护地解决群众困难
  　丁村成滩造林合作社坚持七年有很大成绩
    【冀中讯】定县丁村成滩造林合作社，已经坚持了七年。在防风、护地、防水及解决群众生活困难等方面，得到很大成绩。该村于民国二十八年发大水时，河滩地都冲净了，并淤了一层细沙泥，因此滩地谁也不种。后来区联社的油坊住到这村先行试种。民国三十年在滩地上耩黑豆、禾子六、七亩，没耕没锄，收打三百余斤，群众都很羡慕。第二年，区联社张顺玉同志和村社干部，用这个实例号召群众组织成滩社（按：成滩是指将荒滩修成好地），有一百二十七家入社。经大家讨论：规定按出工多少算帐。当时因缺种籽，便提出种籽折股办法，群众集股解决了一部分。区社及村社又拿出了些贷给群众。选出成滩、压树有经验的屈老潮和宋瑞祥当主任，另设一会计，由村干部兼。组织起来了，群众还有顾虑，除怕赔本误工外，还顾虑负担和地权问题。区公所根据当时政府法令，宣布成滩后不纳负担。第二年又向群众公布：成滩者十五年内不纳租子，十五年后纳租，有永佃权；连冲连成三次以上，地权归成滩人。农民整滩护滩的情绪于是真正提高了，成滩社一年比一年巩固起来。全村一八六户，已有一三二户加入成滩社。该社每年选举干部一次，有事就开会，按季节作计划，帐目公开，由社员民主讨论出各种办法。第一年社员一百二十七人，共划十二小组，每四小组为一大组。全社集体成滩地，以人为单位，按日计股分红。入黑豆种一大升，抵工股一个分红。农民们反映豆股分的太多，说修滩还不如打短工，有五户退了股。第二年该社对大集体成滩与豆股分红的办法做了检讨，宣布出入社自由，改选了干部，并民主制订了新的办法：（甲）以户为社股单位，按小组集体耕种，全社共划十二小组。（乙）将滩地南北割划七十二块，每小组六块（因西头土厚三尺，东头土薄仅一犁，所以各组配搭着分种。）（丙）种子由组员分摊，取消豆种分红这办法，完全按劳力户口分配，各组员平均出工。办法实行后，每年都是按时抢着耕种、收打，种的很上心，一直坚持到今年。
    滩地的树是在统一计划下一块植的，全社公有，大家保护，并订有护林公约，对偷树、砍柴、牲口损坏等现象给予教育、处罚。
    成滩社七年来约成滩地八二五亩，现在种植面积六百亩。栽活树木三万二千棵以上，大树已两手粗，小的也过寸。还有很多条子。便利了防风、护地、防水、淤地。滩池地可耩种黑豆，第一年每工分了六斤至六斤十二两。第二年每工分五十八斤。民国三十三年每户分了六百斤。民国三十四年每户二百二十斤。民国三十五年分一百斤。民国三十六年因旱未收。贫农李岐山用分的豆子添了个驴，屈老英分了三口袋黑豆，用两口袋换了个织布机。屈宝玉一家三口靠分的豆子熬过了饥荒，砍条子、树枝及搂树叶，解决了烧柴困难。民国三十五年打柴八万斤，除每户分柴四百多斤外，打粗条二千斤，卖了二万三千元（冀钞，下同）。民国三十六年收细条子二千斤，卖十万元，都分给了社员。另打粗条一千斤，现存社内。每户还分柴三百余斤。搂树叶、豆叶，收成也很大。这些成绩的获得，除了社内各种办法的民主合理外，主要是因为领导的好，有组织有计划。年年坚持，年年提高。从第二年起便做了栽树打堤计划，每年栽树，就地取苗。在耕作方法上也日益改进，第一年泥泞难耕，只用人力开了三顷。第二年以后即扩至六顷。每年耕一遍，锄一遍。
    目前该社还存在以下问题：（一）滩地沙底种黑豆怕旱，低处土薄容易干枯。今后如把全部滩地逐渐改植条子和木材，比种豆收益更大，更有保障，并且对防水有利，群众还可开展柳编业。（二）群众没柳编技术，要求县区帮助找人去教。
