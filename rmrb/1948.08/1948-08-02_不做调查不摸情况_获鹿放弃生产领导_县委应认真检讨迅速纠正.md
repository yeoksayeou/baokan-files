No Investigation, No Understanding of the Situation
    Huolu Abandons Production Leadership
    The County Party Committee Should Seriously Self-Criticize and Quickly Correct

[This Newspaper Special Dispatch] Correspondent's Exclusive Interview: The reporter began visiting the responsible persons of the Huolu County Party and government and the public offices of the first and seventh districts on the third day after the rain, and went to the countryside to conduct field investigations on agricultural production. From the materials obtained in the past few days, the county has achieved considerable success in timely extinguishing locust plagues and building wells and repairing waterwheels. For example, in villages like Xiaojiaying in the fifth district, 45 waterwheels were repaired and 51 wells were dug. However, on the whole, the county has not paid enough attention to production leadership, which is manifested in having calls and instructions, but rarely conducting specific inspections and supervisions. From early June to four or five days after the rain, the county convened two meetings, taking up a month of time. The vast majority of county and district cadres spent most of their time in meetings, leaving very few people in the districts. For example, in the seventh district, except for a few people who went home to recuperate, only three people were left in the district, causing production to fall into a state of laissez-faire. For example, of the 15 million waterwheel loans issued during the drought prevention period, less than half were actually loaned out by the districts. The sixth district did not loan any at all. Even those that were loaned out did not fully play the role of supporting production. During this period, although some county cadres went to the countryside, they did not conduct in-depth inspections and supervisions, so that problems in production were not discovered and solved in time. It is said that two to three hundred livestock that had been distributed or not distributed, the fruits of land reform, died in the county (including those already distributed and those not yet distributed). In the sixth district alone, 61 mules, 58 donkeys, and 12 cattle died. After this heavy rain, the county and district leaders failed to seize the opportunity to lead the masses to investigate and eliminate wasteland, resulting in many villages leaving a lot of barren land. For example, in Gaoqian Village in the tenth district, more than two *qing* of military land were not planted and were completely abandoned. In the fifth district, 63 *mu* of barren land were left in Qiandu Bei, Chen Village, Nanluojun, and Xiaohe. No one cared about the wasteland. In the sixth district, more than two *qing* of barren land were left in 27 villages. In the seventh district, 50 to 60 *mu* of barren land were left in villages such as Wujiazhuang and Xitumeng. Most of these were military land and undistributed land, and the land of conscripted laborers in many villages was not planted in time.

During the drought period after June 10th, most of the seedlings in some mountainous villages withered due to drought (nearly a quarter of the county are mountainous villages). The county government issued instructions for drought resistance and preparedness for famine, but provided little specific assistance. In the seventh district, the masses of Dongtumeng spontaneously dry-planted more than one *qing* (full seedlings have been obtained after the rain), but the leadership did not discover and promote it in time. After this rain, 3,143 houses and 90 cave dwellings collapsed in 20 villages in the second district, 50 weaving machines were smashed, 5,155 *mu* of seedlings were submerged, 730 *mu* of land were washed away, and 14 wells were destroyed. In Huibei Village in the fourth district, 76 houses collapsed in 165 households. In Xiaobi Village, 2,200 *mu* of seedlings were submerged. In Shiqiao in the eighth district, 57 houses collapsed in 270 households, and 307 stacks of courtyard walls collapsed. In Donghushen in the seventh district, 28 houses collapsed in 68 households, 230 *mu* of land were damaged, and 17 *mu* of paddy fields were damaged by clear water. After the rain in Zaolin, 76 sheep died (they were rained on during the day and died of heat in the caves at night). In Yangzhuang in the urban area, 61 houses collapsed. According to the masses in the urban area, "The flood in the 28th year of the Republic of China was not as severe as this time!" But the leadership did not pay attention to it in time. In addition, not enough attention was paid to organizing emergency planting, emergency weeding, and overcoming difficulties in seeds and labor. According to Comrade Cao, the secretary of the county party committee, "There is no problem with seeds in the county," but the second and third districts have successively sent letters requesting the county promotion agency to lend rapeseed and buckwheat seeds, saying that there is a great shortage of seeds. In villages close to the market, the masses sold wheat seeds to exchange for seeds, but the seeds were very expensive, with buckwheat costing more than 14,000 per *dou*. On July 27th, only three *shi* of buckwheat seeds were available at the urban market. In particular, it is difficult to find seeds for "returning grain to the granary in sixty days." Regarding the above problems, the reporter visited Section Chief Han of the Industrial Section and Director Ge of the Promotion Agency. They knew very little about the situation below. In particular, the Promotion Agency has not made any preparations for solving the seed problem. According to them, in the past fifty days, they have attended more than thirty days of meetings, and the production organization of the county and districts is extremely unsound, so that the situation below cannot reach the top. There is no one in the Promotion Agency to guide production, and the industrial assistants in the districts are sometimes present and sometimes absent. After the land reform in the county, the leadership did not turn to production in time. It was not until the prefectural committee convened a joint meeting of county party secretaries in late May that the county party committee planned (only planned) to use half of its strength to lead production. The county party committee said in its production plan in early July: "Complete the collection before July 10th, and then switch to large-scale production after the 10th." This is an erroneous approach that separates the temporary work of a certain period from the central work of large-scale production. And at that time, it was the critical moment of drought resistance and preparedness for famine! Therefore, if the county wants to carry out a production campaign, it must first conduct a serious self-criticism from the leadership. (Guangming, Bai Qing)

Editor's Note: Being busy with meetings all year round, and each meeting is not well prepared in advance, so the meeting time is very long, and no name can be made, but the time for doing practical work is squeezed out. Chairman Mao said that we should spend no less than six months a year leading production, but many of our party committees spend no less than six months going to meetings. After the meeting, resolutions are made and instructions are written, but after the resolutions and instructions are issued, everything is fine, or they go to the meeting again, and they do not check the extent to which the resolutions and instructions are implemented, modify or supplement the deficiencies of the resolutions, and then conduct inspections, so that meetings are often formed, writing resolutions, meetings, writing resolutions, this is the leadership method of empiricism plus bureaucracy, if it cannot be corrected severely, the work will not be able to move forward even one step.

    不做调查不摸情况
    获鹿放弃生产领导
    县委应认真检讨迅速纠正
    【本报特讯】总分社记者专访：记者于雨后第三天开始走访获鹿县党政负责人及一、七两个区公所，并赴乡村实地考查农业生产情形。从数日来所获材料看，该县在及时扑灭蝗灾与造井、修水车上获得相当成绩。如五区肖家营等村修水车四十五架，打井五十一眼等。但整个说来，该县对生产领导未有足够重视，表现在有号召与指示，但很少做具体检查督促。从六月初旬至雨后四、五天止，光县上召集的两次会议就有一个月时间。绝大部分县区干部都把大部时间化费在开会上，区上留人很少。如七区除几个人回家养病外，区上仅留三人，使生产陷于自流。如在防旱期间所发一千五百万水车贷款，各区实贷下去的不足一半。六区根本没往下贷。贷下去的，亦未充分发挥扶助生产的作用。在此期间，县干部虽有部分下乡，但深入检查督促不够，致生产上的问题没及时发现与解决。据说全县死土地改革果实牲口二、三百头（包括已分与未分），光六区即死骡子六十一头，驴五十八头，牛十二头。此次透雨后，县区领导未能抓紧领导群众查荒灭荒，以致不少村庄遗留白地很多。如十区高迁村军田两顷多没人种，全部荒芜。五区前杜北，陈村，南落峻，小河有六十三亩白地。荒芜没人管，六区廿七个村有白地两顷多。七区武家庄、西土门等村遗留白地五六十亩。这些大部为军田及未分配的土地，不少村庄出征民工的土地未及时种上。
    该县在六月十日后的天旱期间，有些山地村大部禾苗旱枯了（全县近四分之一是山地村），县府为此曾下过抗旱备荒指示，但很少具体帮助。七区东土门群众自发的干种一顷多（雨后已获全苗），但领导上也未及时发现与推广。这次雨后，二区二十个村塌坏房子三一四三间，窑洞九十个，砸毁织布机五十架，淹没禾苗五一五五亩，冲坏土地七三○亩，毁井十四眼。四区灰北村一六五户塌房七六间。小壁村淹没禾苗二二○○亩。八区石桥二七○户塌房五七间，坍院墙三○七垛。七区东户神六八户塌房二八间，损坏地二三○亩，水地被清水泡坏十七亩。枣林雨后死羊七六只（白天雨淋，晚上在洞内热受病死）。城关区杨庄塌房六一间。据城关群众谈：“民国二十八年水灾那样大，也没这次厉害”！但领导上也未能及时注意。此外，对组织抢种、抢锄、克服籽种、劳力等困难，注意也不够。据县委书记曹同志谈：“全县籽种不成问题”，但二、三区却先后来信要求县推进社贷给菜籽、荞麦种籽等，并说缺种很多。离集近的村，群众把麦籽粜了换成种籽，但种籽很贵，荞麦每斗在一万四以上。七月廿七日城关集上才上荞麦种籽三石多。特别是“六十天还仓谷”的种籽很难找到。记者就以上问题，曾走访实业科韩科长，推进社葛主任，他们对下边情况都很少了解。特别是解决籽种问题，推进社未做丝毫准备，据谈：近五十天当中，他们参加三十多天会议，加上县区生产组织极不健全，以致下情不能上达。生产计划不能付诸实施。推进社生产指导都空无一人，各区实业助理员时有时无。该县在土改后，领导即未及时转向生产。至五月下旬地委召开县委书记联席会议时，县委才打算（仅仅打算）用一半力量领导生产。县委在七月初的生产计划上说：“七月十日前完成征收，十日后转入大生产”。这是把某一时期的临时工作与大生产的中心工作割裂开来的错误作法。而当时正是抗旱备荒的紧急关头！所以该县要开展生产运动，首先需要从领导上做认真的检查。      （光明、柏青）
    编者按：一年忙于开会，每次开会，事前没有很好的准备，以致会议时间拖的很长，也开不出个名堂来，但把做实际工作的时间都挤掉了。毛主席说我们一年应拿出不少于六个月的时间，领导生产，而我们许多党委却是用不少于六个月的时间去开会去了。开会以后就做决议写指示，但决议指示发下后就万事大吉，或又去开会，而不去检查决议指示执行的程度，修正或补充决议之不足，再进行检查，以致经常形成开会，写决议，开会，写决议，这就是经验主义加官僚主义的领导方法，如不能痛予纠正，工作将一步也不能向前推进。
