　　Should Singing Operas Be Banned?
    Editor:
    I am a small merchant from a rural village in Xingtai West Township. This spring, I read an article in the newspaper about developing private industry and commerce, boosting the rural market, and helping small merchants. I was very happy, so I found four or five emancipated farmers in our village, pooled our resources, and set up a sundry goods stall. We go to the rural fairs every month, and business is very good. On June 1st, there was a grand fair in Zhougong Village, Xingtai West Township. Most of the small merchants came to the fair, but unexpectedly, during the fair, a cadre from the Third District, who was in charge of the theater troupe, banned the singing of operas. As a result, people at the fair dispersed, and the small merchants were greatly affected. Some small merchants went to the district cadre to appeal, but the district cadre said, "Operas are not allowed, I don't care about the consequences." I said, "Now we need to develop industry and commerce, I saw it in the newspaper." He said, "You can't just look at the newspaper, you have to listen to the leadership from the district." I don't know whether the newspaper is the standard or the district is the standard. I hope the editor can answer this.

    Answer: Farmers work hard all year round, and they should have some entertainment at appropriate times. Singing operas during the grand fair in Zhougong Village can liven up the fair and develop trade, and should not be banned on the pretext of waste. However, during the busy farming season, operas should generally not be sung to avoid affecting production. At the same time, in order to prevent the performance of old opera programs that are obscene, promote theft, or promote superstition, the county and district governments can conduct necessary reviews and selections in advance to determine the performance programs. The Third District cadre's failure to explain to the masses and merchants before temporarily stopping the performance is incorrect. You ask who is the standard. Because there is only one policy, this should not be a problem. The standards in the newspaper and in the district should be consistent.

专栏：询问与答复

　　应否禁止唱戏
    编辑同志：
    我是邢台西乡一个农村的小商贩，今年春季在报纸上看了一篇发展私人工商业，繁荣农村市场，帮助小商贩的消息，我是高兴的很，便到我们村里找了四五家翻身农民，集股搞了一个杂布摊，每月赶农村会场，生意很好。六月初一日，邢台西乡周公村大会，一般小商贩们都来赶会，不想正在大会期，来了三区一个干部，他是主管剧团的，禁止唱戏，这样一来，会场的人都散了，小商贩们大受影响。有些小商贩便去找区干部要求，区干部说：“戏是不准唱，会不会我不管”。我说：“现在要发展工商业，我是从报纸看下来的。”他说：“你们不能光看报纸上的，还得听区上来领导。”我不知报纸为标准，还是区上为标准，请编辑同志答复为盼。

    答：农民们一年辛苦，在适当的时候应该有些娱乐。周公村在大会期间唱戏，可以活跃会场发展贸易，不应借口浪费禁止。但在农忙季节，一般不应唱戏而影响生产。同时，为防止诲淫诲盗、宣传迷信的旧剧节目出演，县区政府可事先进行必要的审查选择，确定演出节目。三区干部不向群众商贩进行解释临时制止演戏，是不对的。你问究竟以谁为标准，因为政策只有一个，这不应成为问题，报上和区上的标准应该都是一致的。
