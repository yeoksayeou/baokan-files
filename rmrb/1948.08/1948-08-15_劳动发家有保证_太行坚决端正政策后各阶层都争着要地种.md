Xinhua News Agency, North China, 11th: Since Taihang areas have corrected the policy towards the middle peasants, resolutely compensated the losses of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, and settled the lives of landlords and former rich peasants, the production enthusiasm of all strata in the rural areas has greatly increased. When Wu'an's ninth district began supplementary land distribution, some farmers were still skeptical about our party's policy of uniting with middle peasants to develop production. After carefully correcting wrongly determined class statuses, compensating for losses, and issuing temporary land certificates, they all smiled and said: "Now there is a standard!" "We don't have to be afraid of getting rich through labor!" A vigorous atmosphere spread throughout the villages. For example, in the past, when some villages distributed land, the bad land was unwanted, and some even wanted to push away extra land. This time, not only was all the land, good and bad, distributed, but also the little land temporarily managed by the village was snatched up for rent. A widow in Shi'er Village had several mu of extra bad land that she wanted to sell, and it was immediately bought. Some households who had been wrongly struggled against started farming the land the day after they were compensated. In all thirty-one villages in the district, houses were being built and livestock bought in every village. Seven villages, including Guzhen, bought seventy-one head of livestock.

　　Wuxiang, Zuoquan (Liao County) and other counties have convened district and village cadres and labor hero conferences to clearly explain our party's policy of developing production and thoroughly clarify the chaotic emotions caused by some deviations in party rectification and supplementary land distribution, such as village cadres being passive and afraid to lead, and middle peasants and labor heroes believing that only poor peasants could get ahead; and first, in the villages where supplementary land distribution had not been carried out, the wrongly struggled households were reclassified, losses were compensated, and landlords and rich peasants were given the necessary living and production materials, setting off a wave of production enthusiasm. The Zuoquan County Party Committee corrected the wrongly determined class status of Zhang Yuqing, a county cooperative hero, and his wife, Zhao Chunhua, a textile hero, and restored their titles as heroes. Zhao Chunhua immediately issued an open letter to women, calling on them to organize production, and convened a meeting of women in her village to review the production work of the first half of the year. In the fifth district of the county, 800 people left to participate in the war, and the labor force was lacking, but due to the high production enthusiasm after correcting the policy, more than 25,000 mu of land were hoed in four days.

　　Zhong Village in She County, after correcting the policy, has all set out plans for intensive farming in the future. In Liuze and other villages in Huguan County, 27 hectares of land have been top-dressed with fertilizer. Zhao Quancheng, whose class status was corrected, said: "This spring, others said that I was a rich peasant. I didn't understand the policy, and I thought I might as well take a break. This time, I was reclassified as a well-to-do middle peasant, and I was relieved. My family's 31 mu of seedling land has been universally top-dressed with fertilizer, averaging 45 dan per mu."

　　劳动发家有保证
  　太行坚决端正政策后各阶层都争着要地种
    【新华社华北十一日电】太行各地自端正中农政策，坚决赔偿错斗中农的损失，安置地主旧富农生活后，农村各阶层生产积极性大为提高。武安九区在着手抽补时，部分农民对我党团结中农发展生产政策，仍将信将疑。经过慎重改正错订成份，赔偿损失及制发临时土地证后，都眉开眼笑地说：“现在算有个标准了！”“劳动发家不用怕了！”一种蓬勃气象，横溢各村。如过去有的村子分配土地，坏一点的就没人要，甚至多的还想往外推。这回不但好坏地一律分完，连暂由村上管理的一点地也都抢着要租种。史二庄一个寡妇有几亩多余的坏地想出卖，立刻就被人买了去。有些错斗户昨天才补进地，今天就去耕种。全区三十一个村子，村村盖房买牲口。固镇等七个村子即买了七十一头牲口。
    武乡、左权（辽县）等县都曾召开了区村干部及劳动英雄大会，明确地阐明了我党发展生产政策，并彻底澄清由于整党、抽补中某些偏向所造成的混乱情绪，如村干部消极不敢领导，中农、劳动英雄认为只有贫农才吃得开等；并先在未进行抽补的村子，改订错斗户成份，赔偿损失，分给地主富农以必要的生活资料和生产资料，掀起生产热潮。左权县委改正了县合作英雄张玉清、纺织英雄赵春花夫妇被错订的成份，恢复其英雄称号，赵春花立即给妇女发出公开信，号召组织生产；并在其所在村召集妇女开会，检讨前半年生产工作。该县五区有八百人出发参战，劳力缺乏，但由于端正政策后生产情绪高涨，在四天中即锄完二万五千余亩地。
    涉县钟村，经过端正政策，都定出今后精耕细作的计划。壶关县流泽等村有廿七顷地上了追肥。改正了成份的赵泉承说：“今年春天别人都说我是富农，咱对政策也摸不透，心想趁早歇歇吧。这次重新划阶级，我划成富裕中农，才放下心。我家三十一亩青苗地，普遍都上了追肥，平均每亩四十五担”。
