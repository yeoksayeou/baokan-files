　　【Taihang Telegraph】Yuci City, an important industrial and commercial town in central Shanxi, newly liberated, has suffered severe damage to its industry due to the bandit阎匪 [Yan's bandits - referring to Yan Xishan's forces], resulting in a large number of workers becoming unemployed. After our democratic government entered the city, it immediately allocated 9,862 jin of wheat for emergency production and self-salvation, to relieve 252 households of railway, wheat flour company, and Yuanwo Power Plant workers who were currently out of food, totaling 1,141 people. After the democratic government took over the Jinhua Textile Factory, originally operated by Yan's Northwest Industrial Company, it was renamed the Liberation Textile Factory, and 485 jin of wheat and more than 1,300 jin of wheat bran were used to relieve 436 workers with difficult lives. After receiving relief from the democratic government, they became even more resentful of the oppression of Yan's bandits. Some workers said during the grain distribution: "From the Japanese to the old thief Yan Xishan, we have never received any relief in the past ten years. Only the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government are our saviors." Worker Liu Zhan said indignantly: "Yan Xishan never even paid enough wages when he was in power." After receiving the relief grain, many unemployed workers have already used it as capital to run small businesses and engage in self-salvation through production. With the strong support of our democratic government, the unemployed workers in various enterprises in the city, in the extremely difficult situation after being destroyed by Yan's bandits, have now seen more than 350 workers resume work. More than 130 railway workers organized themselves to repair the railway immediately after liberation. The newly renamed Yuci Zhenhua Cotton Weaving Factory (formerly Yuci Cotton Weaving Factory, it is not specified whether it is state-owned or private – editor) officially started operation on July 29th, and can now weave 40 bolts of foreign cloth and towels per day. All 124 employees of the factory have resumed work, except for 12 who have returned to their hometowns or gone elsewhere. More than 100 workers in the Liberation Textile Factory have also resumed work. In order to continue to support unemployed workers and starving citizens in restoring production and solving current living problems, the government has decided to allocate more than 8,000 jin of wheat for relief, and the Yuci County branch of the Jinnan Bank has decided to issue 5 million Jichaos in loans. The loan procedures are extremely simple, and loans can be obtained with a letter of introduction from the street work group. The Liberation Textile Factory is also preparing to use another 20,000 jin of miscellaneous grains to relieve the unemployed workers of the factory.

　　民主政府救济失业工人市民
  　榆次城工厂陆续开工
    【太行电】新解放的晋中工商业重镇榆次城，由于阎匪对工业的严重破坏，致使大批工人失业。我民主政府进城后，即先拨紧急生产自救小麦九千八百六十二斤，救济目前已断炊的铁路、麦粉公司及源涡发电厂等工人二百五十二户，共一千一百四十一人。民主政府接收阎匪西北实业公司开办的晋华纺纱厂后，即改名为解放纺织厂，以大麦四百八十五斤，麦麸一千三百余斤救济四百三十六个生活困难的工人，他们在受到民主政府的救济后，对阎匪的统治压迫更加愤恨，在发粮时有的工人这样说：“从日本人到阎锡山老贼，十来年从未救济过，只有解放军民主政府才是救命恩人。”工人刘湛愤慨的说：“阎锡山在时该发的工资都不给发够。”失业工人们领到救济粮后，好多人已将其作为资本经营小生意，从事生产自救。该城各种企业中的失业工人经我民主政府极力扶助，在阎匪摧毁后的极度困难情况下，现已有三百五十余工人先行复业。一百三十多铁路工人自解放后即组织起来修复铁路。新改名的榆次振华棉织厂原榆次棉织厂（未说明是公营或私营——编者），于七月二十九日正式开工后，每日可织洋布四十匹及毛巾等，该厂职工除返乡或他去的十二人外，一百二十四人已全部复工。解放纺织厂百余工人亦已复工。为继续扶助失业工人及饥饿的市民恢复生产解决目前生活问题，政府已决定再拨八千余斤小麦进行救济，并决定由冀南银行榆次县支行发放冀钞五百万元，贷款手续极简便，只须各街工作组介绍即可贷出。解放纺织厂亦正准备再以二万斤杂粮救济该厂失业工人。
