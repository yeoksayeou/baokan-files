【Jizhong Telegram】The Jizhong Labor Hero Wang Luohe Cooperative was established in 1938. It was temporarily suspended due to the war. In the spring of 1945, under the leadership of Wang Luohe, a small-scale mass cooperative was re-established, engaging in businesses such as cotton ginning, textile manufacturing, and sock knitting. Subsequently, a villagers' cooperative was established, handling savings, loans, and operating a lumber mill. In 1946, a medical cooperative was established, but due to the failure to hire a doctor, it merged with the villagers' cooperative. In 1947, a dyeing cooperative was established, engaged in cloth dyeing, and also operating a lumber mill, flour mill, and cotton ginning. In August of last year, a cadre cooperative was established, engaged in transportation and sales, buying and selling cotton, etc. These cooperatives played a significant role in organizing the masses to transfer grain, purchase livestock, and lend cotton to organize women for textile production, thereby helping the masses overcome famine.

After the land reform began last winter, due to the absolute equalitarianism of a few representatives in the village's poor peasant association, the villagers' cooperative's wheat, homespun cloth, and funds were confiscated, and the small-scale mass cooperative was sealed off. Seeing this situation, the cadre cooperative secretly sold off its assets and distributed them among its shareholders. The remaining items from the small-scale mass cooperative that had not been sealed off were also distributed. Only the dyeing cooperative continued to operate in the entire village.

After the production work team arrived in the village and learned that the masses urgently demanded the restoration of the cooperative, they convened a meeting of village cadres. Wang Luohe reported on the establishment, development, and benefits of the cooperative. All the cadres present agreed to restore it, but they had many ideological concerns. The former village chief said, "Everyone is happy about the restoration, but we are afraid of confiscation and closure again in the future." The work team explained that the government's policy is to protect cooperation and mutual assistance and explained the Jizhong Administrative Office's reward measures for cooperation and mutual assistance, which boosted everyone's confidence. Wang Luohe said, "What's so difficult about this? The higher-ups are supporting us; I will definitely do it!" They unanimously agreed to return the items confiscated by the poor peasant association. A preparatory committee was established, and Wang Luohe was elected as the director. Subsequently, a villagers' meeting was held, and all the villagers agreed to the restoration and that the items confiscated by the poor peasant association should be returned and not distributed as windfall gains. The next day, an expanded village cadre meeting was held to discuss how to return the cooperative's items. Because some of the items had already been used by the poor peasant association for other public funds, everyone agreed to return the original items if they were available, and if not, to return the equivalent value. After the items were returned, when calling for share subscriptions, in addition to the original shareholders, fifty new shares were added. After the cooperative was ready, a shareholders' meeting was held, and nine members were elected, with Wang Luohe and Wang Xirong elected as the director and deputy director, respectively. Two accountants, two cashiers, and three salesmen were appointed. The village chief was appointed as a director and was invited to participate in discussions of major issues within the cooperative. The chairman of the farmers' association was responsible for inspecting the accounting and business operations and reflecting the opinions of the masses. Subsequently, six articles of the cooperative's constitution were adopted: (1) To carry out business according to the needs of the masses. (2) Shareholders are free to join or withdraw from the cooperative during the stipulated settlement period. (3) Accounts are reconciled monthly and announced to shareholders, and accounts are settled every six months. (4) Sixty percent of the profits are distributed to shareholders, ten percent for public welfare, ten percent for public reserve, and twenty percent for remuneration. (5) A cooperative affairs meeting is held every ten days, and a shareholders' meeting is held every month. The shareholders' meeting is the highest authority of the cooperative. Currently, the cooperative is purchasing cotton according to the opinions of the masses and organizing the masses for textile production.

　　退回错误没收东西  解除群众思想顾虑
  　王洛合合作社恢复营业
    【冀中电】冀中劳动英雄王洛合合作社，在民国二十七年就成立了。中间因战争关系曾一度结束。民国三十四年春，在王洛合领导下，又成立了群众小型合作社，经营轧花、纺织、打袜子等业务。接着又成立了村民合作社，经营存款、贷款等业务，兼设木厂。民国三十五年成立了医药合作社，后因没聘到医生，便与村民合作社合并。民国三十六年成立染房合作社，除染布外，并兼营木厂、面坊、轧花等。去年八月成立了干部合作社，经营运销，买卖棉花等。这些合作社曾组织群众调运粮食、购买牲口、贷出棉花组织妇女纺织，在组织群众生产渡荒上起了不小作用。
    去冬土改开始后，因该村贫农团内少数代表存在着绝对平均主义的错误思想，把村民合作社的小麦、土布和款没收了，群众小型合作社被查封了。干部合作社看到这种情况，便偷着把东西变卖，按股分了。群众小型合作社未被查封的东西，也分掉了。全村只剩下染坊合作社继续经营。
    生产工作组到了该村，了解了群众对恢复合作社要求很迫切，便召开村干部会，由王洛合报告了合作社的成立、发展和好处，当场全体干部同意恢复，但思想上有很多顾虑；旧村长说：“恢复大家都乐意，就怕以后还闹没收封门。”工作组说明政府对合作互助是保护政策，并解释了冀中行署对合作互助的奖励办法，大家才提高了信心。王洛合说：“这有什么困难？上级又给咱作主，我一定干！”对贫农团没收的东西，一致同意退回。并成立了筹委会，选举王洛合为主任。接着又开村民大会，全村群众都同意恢复，贫农团没收的东西，也应退回，不能当浮财分掉。第二天又召开扩大村干部会，讨论了如何退交合作社的东西。因为有一部分东西贫农团已经当其他公款用掉，大家意见是有原物的退原物，没原物的折价退回。东西退回以后，号召入股时，除原来的股东外，又新增了五十个股。合作社筹备就绪后，便召开股员会选举了九个委员，王洛合、王喜荣当选正副主任。下设会计二人，出纳司库二人，业务员三人。并推村长为董事，社内讨论较大问题叫他参加。农会主任负责检查会计与业务经营，反映群众意见。接着又通过社章六条：（一）根据群众需要开展业务。（二）社员在规定结帐期间出入社自由。（三）帐目每月小结一次，向社员公布，每半年结帐一次。（四）百分之六十为社员分红，百分之十为公益金，百分之十为公积金，百分之二十为酬劳金。（五）每十天开社务会一次，每月开社员大会一次，社员大会为合作社最高权力机关。目前该社正根据群众意见购买棉花，组织群众纺织。
