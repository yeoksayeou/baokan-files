[Jizhong Electric] Recently, the northern Renqiu area (along the Daqing River) conducted an inventory of war support materials and discovered that, out of the 73,900+ jin of rice compensated to the masses for war support material losses, a significant portion was wasted due to lax organization and leadership. Some villages falsely reported war support expenditures and material losses. For example, Zaolin Village actually lost rafters, guns, reeds, etc., totaling 4,338 jin of rice, but reported a loss of 14,219 jin of rice. Zhengzhou falsely reported a loss of 11,780 jin of rice, and the leadership, without detailed investigation, was deceived. Sometimes, delays in clearing resulted in losses for both the public and the private sectors. Three large boats were damaged in Qinghekou. It would have only cost 7,500 jin of rice to repair them at the time, but because the repairs were delayed for six months, the public spent 30,000 jin of rice, and the boat owners spent 9,705 jin of rice and 8,000 jin of corn to finally repair them. In some places, materials were not well-maintained, leading to loss and damage, which increased the burden on the masses. For example, Qinghekou Village had 61 rafters and 27 doors left over from bridge construction, but they were not returned to the masses in a timely manner and were left on the embankment and in reed pits, resulting in damage. When the militia set up defenses in this area, they took more than 200 quilts from seven villages, all of which were ruined. After a thorough self-criticism, the county logistics department put forward several improvement measures to address these serious waste phenomena: (1) Strictly establish a war support expenditure system, assign dedicated personnel to be responsible, and educate and punish those who have unclear expenditure procedures, falsely reported figures, and wasted expenditures at all levels. (2) Strengthen the safekeeping of support-the-front materials to ensure that they are not damaged and can be supplied for military use at any time.

　　组织领导不严密
  　任邱战勤开支严重浪费
    【冀中电】任邱北部地区（大清河边沿），最近清理战勤物资，发现赔偿群众战勤物资损失米七万三千九百余斤中，由于组织领导不严，其中有一大部分是浪费了的。有些村庄假报虚报战勤开支和物资损失；枣林庄实际损失檩、枪、苇子等物共折合米四千三百三十八斤，但是报了损失费一万四千二百一十九斤米；郑州假报损失费一万一千七百八十斤米，领导上没有详细调查，被哄骗了。有时因为拖延清理，使公私都吃了亏。清河口损坏了三只大船，当时只用七千五百斤米即可修好，因为拖了六个月才修理，结果公家化了三万斤米，船户化了九千七百零五斤米和八千斤玉茭，才修好了。有的地方对物资不很好保管，散失损坏，增加了群众负担；如清河口村架桥剩下檩六十一根，门二十七扇，没有及时还给群众，扔在堤坡、苇坑里，都损坏了。民兵在此地设防时向七个村要了二百多条被子，都糟蹋坏了。以上这些严重浪费现象，经县后勤部深刻检讨后，提出几点改进办法：（一）严格建立战勤开支制度，设立专人负责，对各级开支手续不清、假报数字、浪费开支的给予教育和处分。（二）加强支前物资的保管，保证一方面不受损坏，一方面能随时供给军用。
