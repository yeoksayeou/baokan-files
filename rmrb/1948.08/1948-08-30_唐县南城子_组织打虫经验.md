　　Tang County Nanchengzi
  　Experiences in Organizing Pest Control
    [North Yue Telegram] Nanchengzi, Tang County, has gained the following experiences in eradicating armyworms: (1) County and district cadres must personally go to the villages to investigate, grasp the actual situation, and provide specific guidance. In the past, armyworm infestations frequently occurred in the Nanchengzi area. Because the villagers had some superstitious ideas, they were unwilling to publicize it after discovering it. Village cadres with superstitious ideas also said it was not a big deal. Comrade Gao Mingwen of the County Industrial Department personally went to the village to inspect and discovered that the insect infestation was serious. He went to the fields with the village cadres to see for themselves, and only then did the cadres become anxious and realize that they must be eradicated. (2) A strong leadership must be organized. Based on the experience of Nanchengzi, Tang County stipulates that a command headquarters for armyworm eradication must be established in every village where armyworms occur, to specifically plan and lead the masses in the eradication efforts. (3) Vigorously publicize and mobilize, and persuade the masses to consciously participate based on their level of awareness and habits. When the masses in Zhuangtou Village, Sixth District, were not ideologically prepared, they were forced to organize eradication efforts, resulting in many old ladies blocking the work at the edge of the fields, and those who participated in the pest control dispersed, with no effect at all. The masses in Nanchengzi Village did not have a habit of mutual assistance. The first time they were organized according to the self-defense team system, and collectively went to the most serious fields south of the village to fight the pests. The result was a failure. The villagers said, "We also have them in our fields. If we don't get to fight our own but have to fight for others, who is willing to do it wholeheartedly?" Later, according to the discussion of the parents' meeting, it was unanimously advocated that "individuals fight their own, and each parent is responsible." The next day, all the mobile labor went to the fields, and they worked very hard to fight the pests.

### 唐县南城子　组织打虫经验

　　唐县南城子
  　组织打虫经验
    【北岳电】唐县南城子扑灭黏虫，已获几点经验：（一）县区干部必须亲自下乡检查，掌握真实情况，具体指导。南北城子一带过去经常发生黏虫，老乡们因存有一些迷信思想，发觉后不愿声张，有迷信思想的村干部也说不当紧。县实业科高明文同志亲赴该村检查，始发现虫害严重，和村干部到地里亲自去看，干部才着了急，认识到必须扑打。（二）必须组织强有力的领导。唐县根据南城子的经验，规定凡发生黏虫村，都成立扑黏虫指挥部，具体计划与领导群众扑打。（三）大力宣传动员，根据群众觉悟程度及习惯，说服群众自觉进行。六区庄头村在群众思想没搞通时即强制组织扑打，结果有好些老太太到地边阻挡，参加打虫的人也都溜散，毫无效果。南城子村群众没有互助习惯，首次按自卫队编制起来，集体到村南最严重地里去打。结果失败。老乡们说：“我们地里也有，不叫打自己的，给别人打，谁肯安心。”后根据家长会讨论结果，一致主张“个人打个人的，由各家长负责。”次日全部能动的劳力都下地了，打的劲很好。
