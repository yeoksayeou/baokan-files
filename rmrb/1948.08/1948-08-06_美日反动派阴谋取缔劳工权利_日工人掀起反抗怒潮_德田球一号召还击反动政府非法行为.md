    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: The U.S. military occupation authorities' direct interference in the Japanese labor movement, and the attempt by the Ashida government to formulate an anti-strike law based on MacArthur's letter of July 22, have ignited a tide of resistance among Japanese workers in various industries, ranging from protests to declarations of strikes. According to a Reuters report on the 28th: The Japanese cabinet interpreted MacArthur's letter to Ashida as an order prohibiting strikes by government employees and has decided to issue a temporary ordinance accordingly, prohibiting public officials from exercising the right to collective bargaining or strike. This temporary ordinance will remain in effect until the parliament revises the National Public Service Law. According to a TASS dispatch quoting the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun: The extraordinary session of the Japanese parliament to be convened in September will fundamentally revise the labor law: the government plans to include workers in coal mines, steel, textiles, and other industries in the category of public and municipal employees who are not allowed to strike. Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a call on July 29, stating: "If the government commits various illegal acts, the trade unions have unlimited rights to retaliate." (Agence France-Presse) The National Federation of Industrial Labor Organizations issued a statement, criticizing the attempt to revise the current labor law and announcing that it would "mobilize all organizations to crush the government's conspiracy (Reuters)." The National Liaison Committee of Public Servants and Municipal Employees Unions and the Japan Teachers Union have all condemned the Ashida Cabinet's unconstitutional behavior. Trade union newspapers and progressive newspapers have launched a vigorous campaign to protest against the "revival of fascism." Despite the Japanese government's threats to dismiss 15 percent of public officials and to "use the most severe punitive measures" against strikers, Ichikichi Tsuchibashi, chairman of the National Postal (i.e., Transportation) Workers' Union, announced to foreign reporters on July 31 that postal and telecommunications workers would hold a general strike on August 7 to protest anti-strike legislation. According to another Agence France-Presse report: Union leaders announced on July 29 that 500,000 workers would demonstrate in downtown Tokyo on August 15 against the proposed anti-strike law. Leaders of the Federation of Industrial Labor Organizations predicted that approximately 2.4 million government employees would conduct continuous regional strikes to defend union rights.
