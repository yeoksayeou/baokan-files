　　High Morale of Xiangyuan Laborers During Jinzhong Campaign

　　The Xiangyuan laborers who participated in the Jinzhong Campaign this time had very good morale, demonstrated various outstanding achievements, and completed the tasks they were responsible for. When the Dachang Town battle began on July 13th, twenty-seven laborers attached to the 6th Company of a certain unit volunteered to help the troops dig trenches. Comrade Cui Ranxing contributed the most. He was covered in sweat and continued digging after taking off his clothes. The comrades of the troops advised him to put on his clothes to avoid catching a cold. He said, "It doesn't matter! It's too hot to work with clothes on. Our comrades are not afraid of shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, what am I afraid of if I contribute some effort?" During the general offensive on the 24th, Comrade Yan Jiasheng, amidst intense artillery fire and aircraft strafing, crawled into a temple and rescued the wounded from the front line. Wang Cheng, Zhao Fuxi, Zhao Youcai, Li Cunwang, Lu Tianlai, and other eight laborers also successively rescued eight wounded soldiers. Ji Tianfu, leading three stretchers, completed the task of rescuing the wounded and also snatched a gun from the artillery fire. They demonstrated heroic and tenacious spirit, and were also very affectionate in their care for the wounded. For example, Comrades Zhang Xilan and Chen Shutang saw that the wounded soldiers' clothes were soaked with blood, and immediately opened their own quilts to lay them on, and covered them with their own lined clothes. Comrades Zhao Anming and Cui Fengwu, while transferring the wounded, promptly found boiled water for the wounded to drink along the way and took care of their needs for relieving themselves. Old man Li Gouhai put his quilt on the stretcher while marching, ready to spread it out as soon as he heard the signal.

　　晋中战役中襄垣民工情绪高
    襄垣民工这次到晋中参战，情绪很好，表现出各种突出的成绩，完成了他们应担负的任务。七月十三日大常镇战斗开始时，附属在某部六连的二十七个民工，自动报名帮助部队挖交通壕。崔然兴同志最出力，他满身流汗，脱掉衣服继续挖，部队同志劝他穿上衣服，怕着凉了，他说：“不要紧！穿衣服热的不能干，咱们同志流血牺牲还不怕，我出些力气怕什么？”到二十四日总攻时，燕甲生同志在激烈的炮火与飞机扫射声中，爬进庙内，将伤员抢下火线来。王成、赵富喜、赵有才、李存旺、路天来等八个民工，也相继抢救八个伤员。冀天富带领的三付担架，完成抢救伤员任务，还从炮火中抢下来一支枪。他们发挥了英勇顽强的精神，并对伤员的爱护也十分亲热。如张喜兰、陈树棠二同志见伤员的衣服都被血闹湿了，马上把自己的被子打开给伤员铺上，把自己的夹衣服给盖上。赵安明、崔凤武等同志在转送伤员时，一路上及时给伤员找开水喝，招呼伤员大小便。栗苟孩老汉在行军时，就将被子放在担架上，准备一遇彩号马上就能铺。
