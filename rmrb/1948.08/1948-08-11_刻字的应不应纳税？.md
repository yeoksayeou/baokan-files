　　Should Letter Carving Be Taxed?
    To the Editors:
    I have a difficult question, which is whether workers who carve letters should pay industrial and commercial tax. Now I provide my specific situation and opinions on whether tax should be paid for your reference:
    My name is Zhang Shizhen, and I currently live in Wangkuai Village, Second District, Fuping County. I make a living solely by carving letters, making official and private seals, buying and selling stamps, and cigarette brand trademarks (there were no cigarette brand trademarks this year). I work alone, without partners or hired workers, and no one else in my family knows how to carve. I also have no other production. The things I make with my skills cannot be sold in the market or wholesaled to merchants. For example, the Yue Fei brand can only be used exclusively by the Yue Fei Cigarette Factory. Are letter carvers like this pure workers? Are the finished products commodities? Should they be subject to industrial and commercial tax? If so, what is the rationale? Are letter carvers the same as ordinary workers? (Because ordinary workers can produce commodities of no fixed ownership from raw materials, letter carvers cannot.)
  　Respectfully, Zhang Shizhen

Zhang Shizhen:
    We have asked the Border Region Government's United Industry Department to answer your question as follows:
    Independent handicraft laborers who "make a living solely by carving letters" should also bear and pay income tax on their earnings like other laborers. The taxation method can be determined by the government based on the specific circumstances. – Editor

### 刻字的应不应纳税？

　　刻字的应不应纳税？
    编者同志：
    我有一个疑难问题，就是关于刻字的工人是否应纳工商税的事，现把我的具体情况及应否纳税的意见提供如下以供参考：
    我叫张士珍，现居阜平县第二区王快村，专以刻字维持生活，做些公私印信、买卖图章、烟牌子商标（烟牌子商标今年根本没有），一个人做工，没股伙，没雇工，家中别人也都不会刻。同时也无其他生产。我凭技术做出的东西，不能销售于市场，不能批发于商贩，比如岳飞牌子就只可岳飞烟厂专权使用。象这样的刻字工人是否属于纯粹工人？所做成品是否属于商品性质？应否纳工商税？如应纳，道理在什么地方？刻字工人是否与一般工人相同？（因一般工人都能以原料生产无定主的商品，刻字工人则不然）
  　张士珍谨启张士珍君：
    你的问题我们已请边府联合工业厅答复如下：
    “专以刻字维持生活”的独立手工业劳动者，也应和其他劳动者同样负担、交纳其收益所得税。征税办法，可请由政府根据具体情形规定。——编者
