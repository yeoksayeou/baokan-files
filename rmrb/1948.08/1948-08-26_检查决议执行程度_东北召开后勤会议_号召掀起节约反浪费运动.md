Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: The Logistics Command of the Northeast Military Region convened a meeting of logistics ministers and health ministers from the entire army last month to inspect the implementation of the resolutions of the spring logistics meeting in various units. Luo Ronghuan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Region, and Chief of Staff Liu Yalou gave instructions at the meeting. Deputy Political Commissar Luo first clearly pointed out: In the future, the scale of the war will be even larger, and the accompanying logistics tasks will be even more arduous. After the last military and political meeting of the Military Region, everyone's understanding of this aspect has changed, but the phenomenon of waste of manpower and material resources is still very serious. For example, there is bureaucracy in grain work, such as: (1) Not carefully inspecting when receiving grain; (2) Not paying attention to grain storage, resulting in moldy grain; (3) Not paying attention to loading and unloading during transportation, resulting in a large amount of loss; (4) The army has not established a grain accounting system; (5) The grain transported to the front in the past was not pre-processed, and with the large scale of the war and the decentralized rural environment, temporary adjustments for processing resulted in great waste. Because the transportation unit has not been established, there is also a waste of manpower and animal power in the use of civilian labor. Deputy Political Commissar Luo pointed out: In the future, these practical problems must be linked during party rectification, so that everyone can recognize the seriousness of these problems, especially leading cadres, to overcome paralysis, tolerance, and laissez-faire in this regard, and make profound self-criticisms. Regarding how to specifically save manpower and material resources, reduce waste, and establish systems, Deputy Political Commissar Luo instructed: In the future, manpower and material resources must be uniformly concentrated and used in a coordinated manner, such as between columns and between divisions. The logistics commands of each line should uniformly coordinate the use of transportation tools of nearby columns. To this end, it is determined that the logistics commands of each line have the right to adjust transportation capacity. When the transportation tools transporting ammunition to the front return to the rear, they should bring back the wounded, and oppose departmentalism that hinders centralization and unification. Comrades from the supply organs must adhere to the system well. If someone claims that the system is not suitable, they should carefully check whether it is really unsuitable, and do not casually raise the issue to higher levels. If anyone is criticized for adhering to the system, the leadership should support these comrades and give them praise. If there are military leaders who hinder the implementation of the system, it should be submitted to the higher-level party committee for discussion, in order to achieve the spirit of adhering to the system and establishing the rule of law. Chief of Staff Liu pointed out in his speech: Our troops and localities are expanding day by day, and logistics work has undergone fundamental changes compared with the past. This has resulted in a situation where the organization, cadres, capabilities, and experience are not commensurate with the current scale. Therefore, cadres must universally improve their consciousness and humbly bow their heads to learn new things. Complacency and conservatism are the biggest obstacles to the advancement of our cause. In the future, we should study problems more, think of ways, and study logistics work as a strategic task; at the same time, we must have a fighting spirit, fully promote intra-party democracy, and abide by discipline, in order to improve the political atmosphere of logistics. After the meeting, the Logistics Command convened a meeting of participating cadres to study and provided specific methods to overcome the waste of grain, manpower, and animal power, and called on all units to launch a movement of economy and anti-waste.

　　检查决议执行程度
  　东北召开后勤会议
  　号召掀起节约反浪费运动
    【新华社东北廿三日电】东北军区后勤司令部于上月间召开全军后勤部长、卫生部长会议，检查今春后勤会议决议在各部队中贯彻和执行情形。会上军区副政委罗荣桓及刘亚楼参谋长均有指示。罗副政委首先明确指出：今后战争规模更大了，与此而来的后勤任务也更加繁重。上次军区军政会议后，大家在这方面的认识上有了转变，但人力物力上的浪费现象仍然很严重。如在粮食工作中存在着官僚主义的现象，如：（一）接收粮食时不好好检查；（二）粮食保管工作不注意，致有粮食发霉现象；（三）运输途中装卸不注意，致有大量的损失；（四）军队没有建立粮食核算制度；（五）过去运给前方的粮食未预先加工，以战争规模之大，又加农村分散环境，临时调换加工，浪费很大。由于运输部队未建立，在使用民工上也存在人力畜力的浪费现象。罗副政委指出：今后整党中必须联系这些现实问题，要使大家都认识这些问题的严重性，尤其领导干部，要克服在这方面的麻痹、纵容、放任，深刻检讨。关于如何具体节约人力物力减少浪费和建立制度问题，罗副政委指示：今后必须统一集中和调剂使用人力物力，如纵队与纵队之间，师与师之间就可以调剂使用。各线后勤司令部则应将就近各纵队的交通工具统一调剂使用。为此，确定各线后勤司令部有权调整运输力，前方运弹药的交通工具回后方时，就应带回伤员，反对妨碍集中统一的本位主义。供给机关的同志要很好的坚持制度，有人喊制度不合适，应仔细检查一下，是否真不合适，不要随便把问题向上级提。如有因坚持制度受到批评的，领导上应该给这些同志撑腰，并给以表扬。如果有部队首长妨碍制度执行时，应提交上级党委讨论，以达到坚持制度树立法治的精神。刘参谋长讲话中则指出：我们部队和地方日益扩大，后勤工作和过去比较已起了根本变化，这就产生了组织、干部、能力、经验和目前规模不相称的情况，因此干部要普遍提高自觉性，虚心向新的事物低头学习。自满和保守是我们事业前进中最大的障碍。今后应多钻研问题，想办法，把后勤工作当作战略任务来研究；同时要有斗争精神，充分发扬党内民主，并要遵守纪律，以提高后勤的政治空气。会议结束后，后勤司令部又召集与会干部研究，提供了克服粮食、人畜力浪费的具体办法，号召各部队掀起一个节约反浪费运动。
