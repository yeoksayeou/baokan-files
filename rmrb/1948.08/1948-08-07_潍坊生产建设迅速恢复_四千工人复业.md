Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd: Various production and construction activities in Weifang City are rapidly recovering, and workers from various industries are returning to work one after another. Among the city's 47 handicraft industries, there were originally 4,349 workers, and 3,920 have now resumed work. Among them, the blacksmithing industry is extremely active because farmers are flocking to the city to purchase agricultural tools, and the output cannot meet the demand. Therefore, 498 of the original 500 blacksmith workers are employed. Of the original 773 carpentry and tile workers, 759 have been employed because various factories and shops are repairing buildings destroyed by the Kuomintang army or building new factory and shop buildings. There were originally 1,677 transportation workers in the city (including rickshaw pullers, small cart pullers, wheelbarrow pullers, and night soil collectors), and 1,638 have resumed work. Many rickshaw pullers have converted their foreign carts into trailers, transporting coal, salt, manure, and tobacco to the countryside in exchange for grain, wood, vegetables, etc., and each person's average daily income is quite substantial. In the process of the recovery of the above industries, the democratic government issued small loans of 100 million yuan to help solve difficulties in capital, tools, and raw materials.
