　　Central Hebei Cadres Study Documents and Inspect Work
　　Immediately Improve Shortcomings
　　【Central Hebei Electric】The study movement of cadres in various organs in Central Hebei has achieved preliminary results after a month and a half of rough reading, careful reading, and reflection in connection with personal experiences. The study movement has been enthusiastically launched in various units of the Administrative Office under the leadership of the directors and department heads, and they have begun to inspect their work in connection with practical situations. The units of the Secretariat have reviewed and identified delays and careless phenomena in their work. For example, the health certificates made by the Cadre Section have not been issued from spring until now. The appointment letters for eight county magistrates have been left for two months. These phenomena were identified on the first day of inspection and were addressed the next day. The Department of Civil Affairs inspected a case that had not been resolved for three years and has sent someone to resolve it. Comrades in the Confidential Room reflected on their unauthorized withholding of a flood disaster telegram for eighteen hours. Some units have made preliminary improvements in their working methods after studying. For example, when discussing the issue of on-the-job training for financial and economic cadres, the Secretariat notified the departments in advance to study before the meeting, and as a result, it was discussed in just two hours. The Department of Industry and Commerce inspected and found that the division of labor was unclear and immediately clarified the division of labor. Many comrades have become more active in their work after studying. Comrade Hu Youmeng of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry wrote a material on cooperatives, which was revised three times by the leaders, and he was a little unhappy; but after reading Lenin's words about "revising ten times and rewriting ten times," he felt that he was far behind, and his mood immediately improved. Units such as the Department of Finance and the Interrogation Office proposed to complete today's work today, to do the work as soon as it comes, and to do it thoroughly. Many comrades in the Grain Section do not take a nap or go to bed late at night to complete the work of the day. Cadres of the Hejian County Government follow the documents and connect them with actual work, inspect them once every half month, and evaluate the progress of each comrade. They also stipulate that they inspect their work once every night and plan the work for the next day. After studying the documents, the cadres of the Hejian City Promotion Society inspected the city's loan work and found that there were 63 loan households, but the Hejian County Promotion Society only handed over 42 households when the city was divided; Comrade Harlin of the society wanted to go home due to family difficulties and was negative in his work. After studying the documents, he reflected on his errors, overcame his erroneous thoughts, and became happy. He also took the initiative to find work to do, often working late into the night. After studying the new district policies, the county and district cadres of Xin Gu County (newly划county) in northern Daqing River solved many erroneous understandings of the policies. In the past, some comrades mistakenly believed that the lenient policy was a slogan for external propaganda; they had an impetuous and quick-win mentality when publicizing to the masses; and some comrades had a very vague understanding of the enemy-puppet policies. After studying, they have taken a step forward in their policy level.
　　In order to continue to deepen this study movement, the Propaganda Department of the Central Hebei District Party Committee issued another instruction a few days ago, deciding that cadres above the county level should increase their study of the article "Checking the Implementation of Resolutions is the Basic Method of Bolshevik Leadership." After mid-August, cadres above the county level will continue to study the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948" and "Chairman Mao's Speech at the Meeting of Cadres in Jin Sui," "Comrade Ren Bishi's Report," and "Two Documents of 1933." District cadres will take the "Current Work Issues" printed by the District Party Committee as the main study document. The instructions clearly pointed out that the quality of study depends on the leadership. In the future, Party committees at all levels must participate in the study of their own organs, check the study situation of their own organs, promote the good, criticize the backward, and make the study continue to improve.

　　冀中干部学习文件检查工作
  　发现缺点立即改进
    【冀中电】冀中各机关干部学习运动，经过一个半月的粗读、精读、联系个人反省，已获初步成绩。行署各单位在主任厅长带头下，学习运动已热烈展开，并已初步联系实际检查工作。秘书处各单位检讨出工作中的拖延，粗枝大叶现象，如干部科制的保健证，从春天到现在还没发。八个县长的委任状，已放了两个月。这些现象第一天检查出来，第二天就做了。民政厅检查出一个三年未解决的案子，已派人前往解决。机要室同志反省出把水灾电报无故扣押十八个钟头。有的单位学习后，在工作方法上已有初步改进。如讨论财经干部在职轮训问题，秘书处事先通知各部门，先研究再开会，结果只用两点钟就讨论好了。工商厅检查出分工不清，马上明确分了工。不少同志在学习后工作更加积极。农林厅胡友孟同志写一个合作社材料，领导上修改了三次，他有点不高兴；但看了列宁“成十次修改、十次重作”的话，觉得自己还差的太远，情绪立时好了。财政厅、审讯室等单位，提出今天事今天做完，工作一来就做，一做就彻底。粮食科很多同志不睡午觉，或晚上晚睡，把当天工作做完。河间县府干部按照文件联系实际工作，半月检查一次，评判每个同志的进步程度。并规定每天晚上检查一次工作，计划好第二天的工作。河间市推进社干部学习文件后，检查了本市的贷款工作，发现贷款六十三户，划市时河间县推进社只交代了四十二户；该社哈林同志因家庭困难想回家，工作消极，学习文件后，进行了反省，克服了错误思想，精神也愉快了，并主动找工作做，晚上时常工作到深夜。大清河北新固县（新划县）县区干部学习新区政策后，解决了很多对政策的错误认识。过去有的同志错误的认为宽大政策是对外宣传口号；在向群众宣传时存在着急燥速胜心理；有的同志对敌伪政策认识很模糊，经过学习，已在政策水平上提高了一步。
    为使这一学习运动继续深入展开，冀中区党委宣传部于日前再次发出指示，决定县以上干部增加学习“检查决议执行程度是布尔什维克领导的基本方法”一文。八月半以后，县以上干部继续学习“中共中央关于一九四八年土改、整党工作指示”及“毛主席在晋绥干部会议上的讲话”、“任弼时同志报告”、“一九三三年两项文件”等。区干部以区党委印发的“当前工作问题”为主要学习文件。指示中明确指出：学习的好坏决定于领导，今后各级党委都要参加本机关的学习，检查本机关学习情形，发扬好的，批评落后的，使学习继续提高一步。
