[Jizhong Electric Dispatch] The Jizhong Eighth Military Sub-district has made significant achievements in logistics work over the past six months. The military sub-district and county logistics departments and armed forces departments have implemented joint offices. Supply sections have been established in eight counties, including Renqiu and Wenxin, to gradually unify work steps and reduce chaos. At the beginning of the land reform, some district and village cadres had the mistaken idea of "bad cadres supporting the front." Later, it was clarified that land reform and supporting the front were equally important tasks. Furthermore, with the influence of county heads and armed forces ministers personally participating in supporting the front, this erroneous understanding was corrected, and the morale of cadres was improved. In the past, some cadres lacked a sufficient sense of responsibility towards the war and the masses, resulting in serious waste, even providing more than the front needed or preparing more than requested. After in-depth self-criticism, this was gradually corrected. At the same time, the phenomenon of indiscriminate grabbing was gradually overcome, with the logistics department taking unified control, strictly implementing mobilization procedures, and initially managing to balance the burden. In the past six months, a total of XX0,000 stretchers, X0,000 militiamen, X0,000 carts, and XXX boats were mobilized, and 2,060,000 workers were recruited for river digging. This completed the support tasks for the five campaigns of Baoding North, Ningnan, North of the Daqing River, and Jinghai areas, as well as the river digging project that the military sub-district was responsible for. 388 heroes emerged. Despite the above achievements, there are still some serious shortcomings. In terms of leadership, attention was paid to long-term service while neglecting short-term service. In the past six months, short-term labor accounted for 67 percent of the total service, and short-term animal labor accounted for 91 percent of the total. Waste and illegal mobilization still occurred frequently. When mobilizing, many places failed to closely integrate with the central work, often improvising tasks as they came, resulting in phenomena such as hiring and coercion. Individual cadres in Jian’guo and Xianxian counties engaged in corruption during support work, and were not dealt with promptly and appropriately. Not enough places truly achieved organized teams, rotational attendance, and fair and reasonable attendance. In order to save labor and benefit production, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership and control of the logistics departments in the future, resolutely overcome the chaotic state of anarchy and lack of discipline, eliminate waste, corruption, and illegal mobilization, strengthen compulsory education for attendance, and implement democratic discussion of fair and reasonable attendance methods.

　　冀中八分区严格动员手续
  　战勤负担走向平衡
    【冀中电】冀中八分区的后勤工作，半年来有很大成绩。分区、县后勤部和武装部实行合署办公，任邱、文新等八个县建立了供应科，使工作步骤逐渐统一，减少了紊乱现象。土改开始时，有些区村干部产生“坏干部支前”的错误想法，后来明确提出土改支前是同等重要的任务，又经县长、武装部长亲自参加支前的影响，纠正了这种错误的认识，干部情绪提高。过去某些干部对战争、对群众负责的精神不足，发生了前方要多少就给多少，甚至要少准备多的严重浪费现象；后经深入检讨，逐渐纠正了。同时逐渐克服了乱抓的现象，作到由后勤部统一掌握，严格动员手续，初步的掌握了负担平衡。半年来共动员××万付担架，×万个民兵，×万辆大车，×××只船，挖河民工二百零六万人，完成了该分区应担负的保北、宁南、大清河北、静海地区等五次战役的支前任务和挖河工程，涌现了三百八十八个功臣。虽有以上成绩，但还存在着某些严重缺点。在领导上注意了掌握长勤而忽视了短勤，半年来短勤人力占勤务总数百分之六十七，短勤畜工占总数百分之九十一，浪费和违法动员现象仍不断发生。动员时很多地方没有抓紧结合中心工作，往往任务一来现编现凑，因而产生雇佣、强迫等现象，建国、献县等县区个别干部在支前中贪污，也未及时适当的处理。真正作到编班编队、轮流出勤，公平合理的还不太多。为了节约劳力，有利于生产，今后应加强勤务部门的领导掌握，坚决克服无政府无纪律的混乱状态，肃清浪费贪污和违法动员的现象，加强出勤义务教育，实行民主讨论的公平合理的出勤办法。
