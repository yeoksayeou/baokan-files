　　Promote Democratic Leadership, Strengthen Worker Unity
  　A Certain Institute of Factory 306 Increases Production by One and a Half Times
    [Shijiazhuang News] After a certain institute of Shijiazhuang's Factory 306 improved its leadership methods, worker unity was strengthened and production efficiency was increased. In the past, the factory's leadership lacked a democratic style, and there were no specific plans, arrangements, or inspections in its work, only simply issuing orders; the workers only knew how to complete tasks, but did not know the importance of the tasks; there were differences of opinion between the directors, and the steps were inconsistent; some cadres could not play a leading role in their work; the workers also had opinions about the factory, believing that the factory was slow to solve problems and that rewards and punishments were unclear, so the workers' production enthusiasm was not high. The original monthly production task was only a little more than one-third completed in twenty days. After the above problems were reflected by the workers, the leadership made a profound self-criticism and resolved to correct them. First, democracy was promoted to gather ideas and benefit everyone, and deliberations were conducted among the workers on how to do a good job. At the same time, it began to solve practical problems and mediate relationships. After individual persuasion, a self-criticism meeting was held, and everyone conducted self-criticism in the spirit of "strict self-discipline and leniency towards others," eliminating prejudices. Next, a meeting of directors, foremen, trade union cadres, and activists was convened to mobilize them, and the internal problems were used for education, dispelling the workers' doubts about production, and further enabling everyone to understand the importance of completing production tasks. Checks were made based on the many questions raised by everyone. Cadres and workers had a new understanding, and their enthusiasm changed suddenly, and they automatically put forward the slogan of exceeding the completion of tasks, launched a competition, and work efficiency increased by one and a half times. In July, the trade union called on members to play an exemplary role, and as a result, the monthly production plan was completed ahead of schedule. A certain department exceeded the plan by 33 percent, and another department exceeded it by 15 percent. The blacksmith class made materials in a timely manner and exceeded the reserve materials by 7 percent.

　　发扬民主领导　加强工人团结
  　三○六厂某所增产一倍半
    【石家庄讯】石市三○六厂某所改进领导方法后，加强了工人团结，提高了生产效率。该厂领导上过去民主作风不够，工作上没有具体计划、布置和检查，只是单纯的以命令办事；工人们只知完成任务，却不知道任务的重要性；各主任间互有意见，步骤不一致；有些干部在工作上不能起带头作用；工人对厂方也有意见，认为厂方解决问题慢，赏罚不明，因而工人生产情绪不高，原定一个月的生产任务，二十天只完成了三分之一强。以上问题从工人中反映出来以后，领导方面便深刻检讨，决心改正。首先发扬民主，集思广益，在工人中进行酝酿，商量如何把工作搞好。同时着手解决实际问题，调解相互间的关系。先经过个别劝说，又开了检讨会，大家本着“责己严、责人宽”的精神进行检讨，消除了成见。接着又召开了各主任、领班、工会干部、积极分子的会议进行动员，把内部存在的问题作了教育，解除了工人们在生产上的怀疑态度，使大家进一步了解了完成生产任务的重要性，并根据大家提出的许多问题进行了检查。干部与工人都有了新的认识，情绪顿时转变，自动提出超过完成任务的口号，展开竞赛，工作效率提高了一倍半。七月份工会曾号召会员起模范作用，结果提前完成全月生产计划。某部超过计划百分之三十三，另一部超过百分之十五。铁匠班及时制成材料，且超过预备品百分之七。
