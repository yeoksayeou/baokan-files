Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th. To adapt to the vigorous development of various construction projects, the Northeast Liberated Area's specialized schools and universities are enrolling students in large numbers this summer. The China Medical University is recruiting 50 researchers in the Liaonan and Andong areas. Applicants must be graduates of medical universities or specialized medical schools; 600 new students are being recruited, and applicants must have a high school diploma; 100 nurses are being recruited, and applicants must have a junior high school diploma. The length of study for students is two years for researchers, four years for new students, and one year for nurses.

The Industrial Specialized School, recently established by the Industrial Department of the Northeast Political Committee, is also recruiting 1,000 new students this year, divided into electrical, mechanical, applied chemistry, mining and metallurgy, textile, and civil engineering. Each subject is further divided into advanced and ordinary classes. Applicants for the advanced class must have a high school diploma, and the length of study is one and a half years; applicants for the ordinary class must have a junior high school diploma, and the length of study is three years. In addition, a number of researchers are being recruited. Applicants must be graduates of science and engineering departments of specialized schools or above, or technical personnel who have worked in various mining enterprises and have a high school or junior high school education.

The Northeast Railway Institute is recruiting more than 500 new students for the civil engineering department. Applicants must have a junior high school education or above; after one year of study, they will be assigned to various railway jobs according to their grades. Those who come from afar to take the exam will be given a one-way free train ticket, regardless of whether they pass or not.

The Changchun Railway Harbin University of Technology is recruiting 300 new pre-科 students. Applicants must have a high school diploma. After two years of pre-科 study, they can be promoted to the undergraduate program. The undergraduate program is divided into architecture, transportation, electrical engineering, and engineering economics. The length of study will be determined separately. These students are specifically trained to be engineers for local railways.

The Harbin Medical Specialized School of the Northeast Red Cross Association is recruiting 200 new students. After completing two years of pre-科 study, they can enter the undergraduate program. The undergraduate program is divided into associate medical departments, with a study period of three years; the pharmacy department is two years, and the nursing department is two years. After graduation, the school is responsible for introducing them to jobs.

The Harbin Special City No. 1 Technical Specialized School is recruiting 600 new students. The school is divided into electrical, mechanical, and agricultural departments, with a study period of four years. Applicants must have a junior high school education or above. In addition to formal courses, students have access to large-scale practical training facilities such as the Harbin Power Plant, the Mechanical Iron Factory, the Farm, the Tractor Factory, and laboratories. Other schools, such as the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications School, the Jilin Military Region Health Technology School, and the Jiamusi Logistics School, have also begun to enroll students in large numbers. More than half of the original students at the Liaobei College, newly established in Sipingjie, came from cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas such as Beiping and Shenyang, and some came from as far away as Sichuan Province. According to Lin Tao, Director of the Liaobei Provincial Department of Education and Vice President of the College, although the college opened on "July 7th," a large number of students continued to arrive at the school from cities in the Kuomintang area requesting to enroll. Of the above schools, with the exception of the China Medical University, the Industrial Specialized School of the Ministry of Industry, the Northeast Railway Institute, the Liaobei College, and the Logistics School, which are completely publicly funded, the remaining schools all have scholarship quotas. For example, the Harbin No. 1 Technical Specialized School provides 60 scholarships to cover all food expenses, 120 scholarships to cover half of food expenses, and 340 scholarships to cover one-third of food expenses to reward students with excellent grades and poor families who cannot afford to pay for themselves.

Furthermore, the former Northeast University and Jilin University have been officially merged into Northeast University by order of the Northeast Political Committee. On the 25th of last month, the two schools held a merger ceremony in the auditorium of the original Northeast University. General Zhou Baozhong, Commander of the Jilin Military Region and President of Jilin University, specially represented the Northeast Political Committee, the Northeast Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to address the teachers and students of the two schools. Zhang Ruxin, the newly appointed President of Northeast University, briefly elaborated on the school's educational policy, academic system, and academic style at the meeting. Finally, all the teachers and students unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the whole country to protest the Kuomintang reactionary group's bloody crime of massacring Northeast students on "July 5th," and to welcome the teachers and students of Henan University and other schools who came to the liberated areas from Kaifeng. The school is currently preparing to enroll a large number of new students.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th. East China is now actively cultivating various construction talents for the new democratic country. In July and August, East China University, East China News Cadre School, East China Jiaotong School, East China Second Senior Industrial School, Shandong Provincial Postal and Telecommunications School, and Shandong Provincial Agricultural and Forestry College all enrolled students one after another. East China University also set up recruitment offices in Jiaodong, Bohai, Qingzhou, Zichuan, Fushan, Yanzhou, Jining and other places. In order to help poor intellectuals go to school, the school waives tuition fees and provides scholarships. The school is headed by Wei Que, former Vice Chairman of the Soviet-Anhui Border Region Government, and Zhang Bochuan as President and Vice-President respectively.

The East China Jiaotong School is divided into four departments: motorcycle, civil engineering, transportation administration, and accounting. The Second Senior Industrial School is temporarily setting up a mechanical engineering department, and is planning to set up a civil engineering department. The school is headed by Zhang Xiehe, Minister of the Industry and Mining Department of the East China Finance Office, and Chen Jiwen, former Principal of Weixian Middle School, is the Director of Teaching Affairs.
