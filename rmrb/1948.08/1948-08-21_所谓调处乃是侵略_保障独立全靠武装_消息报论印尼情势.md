　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS Moscow dispatch: Izvestia published an article by P. P. Preobrazhensky on the 7th discussing the Indonesian situation, emphatically pointing out: "At present, the only thing that can guarantee the freedom and independence of the Republic of Indonesia and prevent the revival of the colonialist regime in Indonesia is the armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia." Preobrazhensky wrote: "The news from Dutch newspapers systematically reporting the Indonesian war every day is enough to illustrate that the guarantees provided by Dutch representatives and the reports submitted by the Tripartite Committee are merely smokescreens. Behind them, the Netherlands is preparing to expand its war of aggression against the Republic of Indonesia. Negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia have been torn apart by the Netherlands, which is wholeheartedly plotting to expand its aggression in Indonesia. The demands of the Netherlands are, in fact, tantamount to ending the Republic of Indonesia and reducing it to a colonial status. Naturally, the authorities of the Republic of Indonesia have rejected the Dutch plan." The author further exposed the conspiracy of the American reactionaries against Indonesia, saying: "It is not an exaggeration to say that the entire 'mediation' committee completely serves the aggressors. It has served Dutch capitalists a great deal and served the real masters of the committee, the American monopoly capitalists, even more." American "large-scale capital has long penetrated into the major industries of the Indonesian archipelago. American monopoly capitalists have also gained control over the Netherlands through the Marshall Plan. Dutch capitalists in Indonesia are becoming merely the executors of American monopoly capitalists. In this situation, the Indonesian people must not only wage a struggle for independence against Dutch imperialism, but also against the protector of Dutch imperialism across the Atlantic." Finally, the author pointed out: "Broad sections of the Indonesian people are waging their struggle. Other vassal states manufactured by the Netherlands in Indonesia and considered by the Dutch colonists to be reliable rear areas are also participating in the anti-imperialist struggle. All these facts show that the unity of the Indonesian people and their determination to resist the Dutch colonists are increasing. Dutch imperialists and their protectors have failed and will undoubtedly succumb to the Indonesian people, who have been defending their independence with weapons in their hands for three years."

　　所谓调处乃是侵略
    保障独立全靠武装
  　消息报论印尼情势
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报于七日发表普列雪夫斯基评论印尼情势一文，着重指出：“目前唯一能保障印尼共和国自由及独立，并阻止殖民者政权在印尼复活的，乃是印尼共和国的武装部队”。普列雪夫斯基写道：“以每天有系统地报导印尼战事的荷兰报纸消息，足够说明：荷兰代表所提供的保证，以及三国委员会所提出的报告，都只是烟幕而已，在它后面，荷兰正准备扩大其对印尼共和国的侵略战争。荷兰与印尼之间的谈判，已被尽心所欲地在印尼图谋扩张侵略的荷兰所撕裂。荷兰的要求，实际上无异于要了结印尼共和国，并使它降低到殖民地的地位。印尼共和国当局自然地拒绝了荷兰的计划。”作者进而揭发美国反动派对印尼的阴谋，他说：“说‘调处’委员会整个地完全为侵略者服务，并不过分。它已对荷兰资本家服务甚多，并对该委员会的真正主人——美国垄断资本家效劳更多。”美国“大宗资本早已伸入印尼群岛各主要工业之内。美国垄断资本家并且还经过马歇尔计划，取得了对荷兰的控制。在印尼的荷兰资本家，正在变为只是美国垄断资本家的执行人。在这种情形下，印尼人民不但要向荷兰帝国主义，而且还要向荷兰帝国主义在大西洋彼岸的保护人，展开争取独立的斗争。”最后，作者指出：“印尼人民广大阶层正在进行他们的斗争。荷兰在印尼所制造的并且被荷兰殖民者认为是可靠后方的其他属邦，亦正在参加反帝斗争。这一切事实都表明：印尼人民的团结与反击荷兰殖民者的决心，都在增强着。荷兰帝国主义者及其保护人已经失败了，并且还要无例外地屈服于三年来手执武器以保卫其独立的印尼人民之前。”
