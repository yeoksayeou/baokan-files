Xinhua North China Telegram: Changchun and Shenyang, 100,000 workers went on strike, and Shenyang students held two grand demonstrations, strongly protesting the Kuomintang reactionary ruling authorities' brutal massacre of Northeast students in Beiping. According to a report in the Tianjin New Star Daily on July 9th, the news that 100,000 workers in Changchun and Shenyang went on strike on the 6th to protest the "July 5th Massacre" has been "officially confirmed" by the Kuomintang. In addition, according to a Shenyang dispatch in the Tianjin Yishi Daily on July 12th, more than 50,000 students from 38 universities and middle schools in Shenyang went to Zhongshan Stadium at 11:00 a.m. on the 12th to hold a memorial meeting for the "July 5th" victims. As the students' massive procession passed through the streets towards the meeting place, tens of thousands of citizens spontaneously joined the procession. Amidst the mournful music, students and elders from the Northeast wept together. The presidium immediately issued a declaration, stating that they "will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to support students in Beiping in their struggle against the fascist claws," and read out a public protest letter, putting forward five solemn demands, including severely punishing the perpetrators of the "July 5th Massacre" and releasing the arrested students. The second student demonstration in Shenyang was held on July 27th. More than 10,000 demonstrating students gathered in front of Wei Lihuang's headquarters, shouting slogans such as "Blood debts must be repaid" (according to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 28th). Furthermore, the Shenyang University, Middle School, and Elementary School Federation resolved on July 7th to support the actions of students in Beiping and launched a large-scale fundraising campaign.
