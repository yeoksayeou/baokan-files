　　Methods for Preventing and Treating Armyworms
    (1) Collect and burn egg masses: Armyworm eggs are round and mostly laid on the upper half of rice leaves. Any leaves that are yellowed or have curled tips are likely to contain armyworm eggs. Collect and burn them upon discovery.
    (2) Poison with tobacco water spray: To make tobacco water, soak one pound of tobacco leaves or stems in a bucket of boiling water. After one day, when the water turns light yellow, remove the tobacco leaves. This is your tobacco water. Spray this solution directly onto the armyworms to poison and kill them.
    (3) Autumn plowing: Armyworms turn into pupae in the autumn and overwinter underground. Deep plowing in the autumn can turn the armyworm pupae to the surface where they will freeze to death or be eaten by birds.
    (4) Eliminate moths: At night, set up a light in the field, with a basin of water underneath. Add some kerosene to the water. Moths are attracted to the light, and when they fly into it, they will fall into the water and drown. This method must be carried out simultaneously by everyone in the area where armyworm moths are found; otherwise, you will attract moths from other areas to your field.
    (5) Wheat bran and arsenic poisoning method: Mix wheat bran, arsenic, and water to create a poisoned bait. Spread the bait in the fields at dusk. Armyworms will eat it and be poisoned to death.
    (6) Crop rotation: This pest specifically targets grain crops. If the grain field from this year is planted with other crops next year, you can avoid being harmed. (Reprinted from Chahar Daily)

　　黏虫的防法和治法
    （一）采烧卵子：黏虫的卵是圆形，多产在谷叶子的上半截，凡是叶面枯黄或叶尖卷缩的叶子，大都有黏虫的卵，见到就采下烧掉。
    （二）用烟草水喷射毒杀：烟草水的制法，用烟叶或茎一斤浸在一桶开水里，经过一天后，烟叶制成淡黄色，这时把烟叶捞出去即成，用时把此药水洒在黏虫身上，就可毒死它。
    （三）秋耕地：黏虫到秋天就变成蛹藏在地下过冬，秋天要是把地深耕，就可以把黏虫的蛹翻在地面上冻死，或被鸟吃掉。
    （四）除蛾：晚上在地里点灯，灯下放水盆，水里加些煤油，蛾见火飞来，碰火落到水里，即被淹死，这个办法必须在发现黏虫蛾的地区大家同时做，不然就会把别处的蛾子都引到自己地里来。
    （五）麦麸含砒毒杀法：即用麦麸和砒霜加水混合做成毒饵，于黄昏时撒布田间，黏虫食之就被毒死。
    （六）轮作：此虫专为害谷类作物，如把今年的谷地于明年改种其他作物即可避免受害。（转载察哈尔日报）
