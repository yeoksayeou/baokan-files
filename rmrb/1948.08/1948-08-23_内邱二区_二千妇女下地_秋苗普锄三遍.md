　　Neiqiu Second District
  　Two Thousand Women Go to the Fields
  　Autumn Seedlings Weeded Three Times
    [Taihang News] After the rain in Neiqiu Second District, as of the 25th day of the sixth lunar month, all 74,876 mu of autumn seedlings that needed weeding in the district had been weeded three times. Some were even weeded four times (such as cotton and sesame), and late autumn vegetables were replanted. In the timely weeding and replanting, in addition to the district and village cadres grasping the work tightly, mobilizing in a timely manner, and planning precisely, special attention was paid to: 1. Mass mobilization of female labor. Due to a large number of laborers joining the army, there were many seedlings but little labor (for example, in Xipang, Fengcun, each village had an average of 70 mu of autumn seedlings per full-time laborer, and the general average was around 40 mu). The entire district mobilized 2,127 women to go to the fields to weed. For example, 103 women in Zhangduo Village weeded 223 mu in one day. Liu Renni, a military dependent from Fengtang Village, and others plowed three mu per person per day. Each village restored its rooftop broadcasting station, and any models and outstanding achievements of the day were immediately broadcasted for praise. The model units and villages also broadcast praise to each other. When a model was discovered in one village, it spread to other villages the next day. This further stimulated everyone's enthusiasm, and they all wanted to strive to be models. After the model individuals were inspected, summarized, and selected in the entire base area, the entire district began unified broadcasting. This was a greater encouragement to everyone, and everyone felt it was an unparalleled honor to participate in labor. Particularly bad examples were also broadcasted for criticism. For example, Ning Xiuzhu, a woman from Duchengpu, did not participate in production, wore oil on her hair, and idled around all day long, ignoring the mobilization of cadres and the masses. Yin Junhua, a cadre of the Shifang Women's Rescue Association, did not lead the masses to the fields after her husband went to join the army, and instead spread discouraging words on the street all day long. Both were subjected to broadcast criticism, and the masses said that those who do not work should not eat. 2. In the past, the masses most disliked our rigid and formalistic mutual aid system. This time, in the rush weeding and replanting, the past ineffective mutual aid was disrupted, and voluntary groups were re-formed, combined with temporary mutual aid. Whoever wanted to work with whom could work with whom, and those who did not want to work together could work on their own. The goal was to mobilize everyone, and all those who could hold a hoe were sent to the fields. The form of mutual aid was not restricted. The entire district organized 557 temporary mutual aid groups to participate in the rush weeding, with 2,133 female laborers. After commendation, promotion, and competition, the seven-day plan was completed in six days. Dongxizhaiyang finished plowing in five and a half days, and Yucuntun completed the summary in three days. (Is it only seeking speed in form? Please check. -- Editor) All the seedlings were weeded once after the rain (military dependents and civilian workers participating in the war also had their fields weeded). The masses in each village generally reflected: "Now that labor is so difficult, and another four or five hundred people have left to participate in the war, we would not have been able to plow the land this time if it weren't for the women going to the fields. Women have done a great job!" (Neiqiu Office, Zhian, Zhenming, Third District Correspondence Group)

　　内邱二区
  　二千妇女下地
  　秋苗普锄三遍
    【太行讯】内邱二区落雨后，截至阴历六月二十五日，全区七万四千八百七十六亩须锄的秋苗，已普锄三遍，还有的拉了四遍（如棉花芝麻等），并补种晚秋菜等。及时锄苗补种中，除了区村干部抓的紧，号召及时，计划精确外，特别注意了：一、大量发动妇女劳力。由于大批劳力参战，苗多劳力少（如冯村西庞，每个村整劳力平均七十亩秋苗，一般平均在四十亩上下），全区发动了二千一百二十七个妇女下地锄草。如张夺村一百零三个妇女下地，一天锄二百二十三亩。冯唐村军属刘仁尼等每天一人拉地三亩。各村恢复了屋顶广播台，发现模范和当天成绩大的，立即广播表扬。并以基点为单位，各村互相广播表扬。这个村发现模范，第二天就传遍了各村。这样更激起了大家的积极性，都愿争取模范。在全基点检查总结评选了模范人后，全区开始了统一广播，这对每个人的鼓舞更大，大家都感到参加劳动的无尚光荣。对特别坏的典型也进行了广播批评。如都城铺妇女宁秀珠、不参加生产，头上楂着油，天天东凉倒到西凉，干部群众动员也不听；十方妇救会干部尹俊花，她男人去参战了，她不带领群众下地，整天在街还说些泄气的话，都受到广播批评，群众都说不劳动吃不开。二、群众历年来最讨厌我们强编制的一套形式主义的互助，这次抢锄补种中打乱过去不起作用的互助，重新自愿结组，结合临时互助。谁愿和谁伙干就伙干，不愿伙干的自己干也行，目的是要动员起来，能拿锄的全下地，互助形式不拘。全区组织起临时参加抢锄的各样互助组五五七个，妇女劳力有二千一百三十三个。经过了表扬，推动，竞赛突击，七天计划，六天全部完成。东西寨阳五天半就拉完，盂村屯三天就作了总结。（是否只在形式上讲求快？请检查。——编者）达到雨后所有青苗统锄一遍（军属及参战民工地也都锄过）。各村群众普遍反映说：“现在劳力这样困难，又走了四五百参战的，这次拉地要不是妇女下地，万也拉不过来。妇女可顶了大事啦。”（内邱办公室、治安、振明、三区通讯组）
