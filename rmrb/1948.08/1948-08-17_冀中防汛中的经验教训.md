　　Experiences and Lessons from Flood Control in Central Hebei
    Currently, the first phase of flood control work in various counties along the river in Central Hebei has largely come to an end. Here are some experiences and lessons learned for reference.
    (1) Adequate preparation is a crucial key to completing flood control work. First, in-depth ideological mobilization should be carried out to overcome the mentality of complacency among cadres and the masses, making everyone take flood control work seriously. Many villagers along the Yunhe River in Jiaocheng County believed that "the Yunhe dike is not easy to breach" and "breaching is inevitable, and blocking it is a waste of effort." Later, after repeated explanations from county and district cadres that breaches would lead to starvation and lack of clothing, and that this year's water situation was different from previous years, and reminding the masses of the past suffering of being flooded, the masses understood and consciously and actively built the dike. In some places, due to insufficient publicity, the masses were not prepared ideologically, resulting in serious flooding. For example, the masses in Shizhuang, Gaoyang, didn't think it mattered beforehand, and only panicked when the breach was imminent, leading to being flooded. Some district committees in Wenxin told the masses: "This matter (referring to flood control) is not important, it is a temporary preparatory work." The laborers listened and became perfunctory, and many laborers did not work for a day, so the embankment was not repaired. Flood control work in Li County was not well communicated at all. When the water came, many villages had not yet set up flood control shelters, and most of the river embankments had not been inspected. Second, it is necessary to do a good job in various organizational work and prepare various flood control materials. When the Zhulong River flooded in Renqiu, all cadres in the county suspended other work to repair the Zhaowang River dike; the county and districts established flood control headquarters, and more than 50 villages along the river established flood control committees, and the laborers were organized into platoons and squads. Villages along the river all prepared flood control materials. In one and a half days, the county repaired more than a hundred miles of dikes, reducing the threat of flooding. Every village along the river built flood control shelters and organized twenty-one emergency teams to inspect the dikes every day. Xiong County heightened and thickened several dangerous sections, preventing some dangerous sections from breaching and reducing the affected area. Beilonghua, Gaoyang, did not prepare anything beforehand, and breached as soon as the water came. Li County did not conduct inspections beforehand and discovered more than seven hundred water seepage points. There were one hundred and thirty-five water seepage points in the ten-mile stretch from Chuzhuang to Xukou, requiring a lot of materials to plug the leaks. In Jiahe, Boye, it took seven mu of crops and more than one hundred and fifty sacks to plug one water seepage point. Third, the main county-level cadres should regularly inspect and supervise the work. The main cadres of the Renhe County Party Committee, including the secretary, personally inspected the dikes and discovered more than five hundred water seepage points. The secretary and county head of Anxin County inspected eighty miles of dikes and found that some flood control shelters had not been set up properly and irrigation ditches had not been blocked, and promptly guided and supervised remedial measures. Some river affairs cadres were incompetent and irresponsible and were adjusted after returning to the county. A meeting of river affairs cadres was also held to study improvement measures.
    (2) Break down localism and mobilize the broad masses to protect together. In Xiliwa, Meizuo, Zhongwuying, and other villages in Anping, due to breaking down localism and establishing a sense of overall awareness, although the water was very strong and the dangerous sections were critical, the dikes were finally protected without any danger under the unity of cadres and the masses, day and night guarding, careful inspection, and courageous repairs. Some villages suffered disasters because of localism and lack of unity. When Zhaizi Village built village embankments, some only built in front of their own houses, resulting in the embankment not being built and water entering the village, causing houses to collapse. In order to fertilize their own fields, the masses in Beilonghua, Gaoyang, did not pay attention to protecting the dikes, causing a breach and flooding many villages' fields. After the Hutuo River breached within the territory of Gaocheng, a small number of people in a small number of villages north of the Cangshi Road disregarded the interests of the majority and opened the Cangshi Road, flooding forty-two more villages. This is another harmful village-level localism that must be overcome, and it is necessary to implement flood control with everyone united and villages united.
    (3) Timely eliminate the masses' concerns and solve practical difficulties. During the emergency rescue and dike protection, some laborers were concerned about their fields at home, and some became pessimistic and lazy and demanded to go home or ran back on their own after hearing that their villages were also flooded. In addition to in-depth publicity and education to explain the advantages and disadvantages of this concern, their practical difficulties should also be appropriately resolved. Regarding the weeding problem, in some villages in Renqiu, men built dikes and women weeded, without delaying either. After repairing the Zhaowang River dike, the county also implemented shift work to take care of production. Xinying and other villages in Anping divided village cadres and the masses into two shifts, one shift to rush to repair the dikes and the other shift to weed in the village. Village cadres and the masses also helped the rescue workers take care of their families.
    (4) Cadres leading flood control should stick to the dike sections and share the joys and sorrows with the laborers. When rushing to repair the Yi Wuying section of the dike, the main cadres of the Central Hebei Works Bureau, Director Hao, Deputy County Head Tian of Hejian, and County Head Liu of Jianguo personally went to the dike to inspect and guide, and many cadres braved the rain to go into the water to plug the leaks, which greatly encouraged the laborers.
    (5) Cadres leading flood control must carefully plan, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and absorb experienced old farmers with flood control experience to participate in the flood control leadership. Due to the lack of good planning in some districts of Wenxin, after mobilizing the laborers to go to the dike, they still did not know where to block, resulting in many laborers resting for a day. The county head of the county did not understand the situation of the dike work, resulting in the failure to repair what should be repaired, while a lot of work was spent on unimportant places. When Qing County rushed to repair the Yunhe River dike, more than 3,000 laborers were mobilized. At first, there was no division of labor, and the villagers led their villagers to the dike. Some villages were active and completed one section and then divided another section; some villages rested and no one cared. More than 7,500 workdays were wasted in two days. Later, work sections were divided, and it was proposed that those who finished early could go home early, and the morale of the laborers was greatly improved. In three and a half days, thirteen dangerous sections were completed, totaling 1,175 zhang, and more than 6,000 zhang of flat work, totaling 12,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In some places, the masses were led by experienced old farmers in dike construction, which was very effective.
    (6) Be vigilant against enemies and bad elements stealing and digging dikes.

　　冀中防汛中的经验教训
    目前冀中沿河各县第一阶段防汛工作大体告一段落。兹将几点经验教训写出供参考。
    （一）充分准备是完成防汛工作的重要关键。首先应进行深入的思想动员，克服干部、群众的侥幸心里，使大家重视防汛工作。交河县运河沿岸很多村群众认为“运河堤不易开”、“开口子是该着的，挡也白费。”后经县区干部反复说明开了口子就没吃没穿，今年水势不同往年。并让群众回忆过去发大水被淹的痛苦，群众想通，即自觉的积极打堤。有些地方因宣传不够，群众没有思想准备，造成了严重的水灾。如高阳石庄群众，事先认为不要紧，快决口了才着了急，致被水淹。文新有的区委向群众说：“这事情（指防汛）不要紧，是临时的准备工作。”民工们听了，也支应起来，好多民工一天不干活，使堤岸没有修好。蠡县防汛工作根本没很好传达，水来了好些村庄还没搭防汛窝铺，大部河堤也没进行签试。其次，必须作好各种组织工作，准备好各种防汛器材。任邱在潴龙河水暴发时，全县干部暂停其他工作，抢修赵王河堤；县区建立了防汛指挥部，沿河五十多村都成立了防汛委员会，民工按班排编制好。沿河村庄都备好防汛器材。一天半中全县修堤百余里，减少水灾危胁。任何沿河村庄都搭了防汛窝铺，组织了二十一个抢险队，每天上堤检查。雄县将几处险工加高培厚，使若干险工未发生决口，缩小了受灾面积。高阳北龙化事先什么也没准备，水一来即决口。蠡县事先没有签试，发现七百多个水眼。厨庄到绪口十里长就出了一百三十五个，致需很多东西堵口。博野夹河为堵一个水眼，就用了七亩地的庄稼及一百五十多条麻袋。第三：县级主要干部要经常巡视检查切实督促指导。任河县委书记等主要干部，亲自上堤巡视，发现了水眼五百多个。安新县委书记、县长检查堤防八十里，发现有的防汛窝铺未搭好，浇地的沟未堵死，及时指导督促补救。有的河务干部不称职、不负责，回县后便进行了调整。并召开河务干部会议，研究了改进办法。
    （二）打破群众本位思想，发动广大群众齐心防护。安平西里洼、梅左、中武营等村，由于打破了群众本位思想，树立了整体观念，虽然水势很大，险工危急，但在干部、群众齐心，昼夜看守，细心检查和奋勇抢修之下，终于护住了堤埝没有出险。有些村庄因闹本位，不齐心，因而遭灾。寨子村打村埝时，有的只打自己门前的，结果村埝没打住，水进了村，弄的房倒屋塌。高阳北龙化群众为了把本村的地淤好，不注意护堤，开了口子，淹了好多村的地。藁城境内滹沱河决口后，沧石路北少数村庄中的少数人不顾多数人利益，打开沧石路，多淹了四十二个村。这又是一种有害的村本位思想，必须克服，必须实行人人齐心村村联合去防汛。
    （三）及时消除群众顾虑，解决实际困难。在抢险护堤中，有的民工结记家里的地了没有，有的听说本村也被水淹，消极怠工，要求回家或自行跑回。对这些顾虑，除了深入宣传教育，讲明利害外，并应适当解决其实际困难。对锄苗问题，任邱有的村是男人打堤女人锄苗，两不耽误。该县修完赵王河堤后，为照顾生产，又实行了换班。安平辛营等村把村干部和群众分成两班，一班上堤抢险，一班在村锄苗。村干和群众并帮助抢险民工照管家事。
    （四）领导防汛的干部应坚守堤段，与民工共甘苦。抢修伊武营一段堤时，冀中工务局郝局长、河间田副县长、建国刘县长等主要干部都亲自上堤巡视指导，不少干部冒雨下水抢堵，对民工鼓舞极大。
    （五）领导防汛的干部，必须精心计划，虚心倾听群众意见，并吸收防汛有经验的老农参加防汛领导。文新有的区由于事先没有很好计划，发动民工上堤后，还不知道从那里堵，结果好多民工歇了一天。该县县长对堤工情况不了解，结果该修的未修，不重要的地方却费了很大工。青县抢修运河堤时，动员三千多民工，起初没有分工分段，那村民工来了就领那村去，有的村积极，作完一段又分一段；有的村歇着也没人管，两天多浪费了七千五百多工；以后分工务段，提出早完早回家，民工情绪大大提高。三天半完成了十三段险工，共一千一百七十五丈，及平工六千余丈，共一万二千方土的工程。有的地方在打堤中通过有经验的老农带动群众，收效很大。
    （六）要警惕敌人坏分子偷扒堤岸。
