Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: According to consolidated reports from Qingdao newspapers, since mid-June, Qingdao has been frequently shrouded in the terror of conscription. Residents have been engaging in passive or active resistance. Whenever they go out, they gather in groups to avoid being caught alone. Some even carry stones, ready to resist if caught. Whenever enemy vehicles stop or enemy troops come out in groups, citizens evade them from afar. At the mere mention of conscription, the streets become deserted. Those caught shout and scream, resisting with all their might, and escape whenever they have the chance. A carpenter caught at Qianhai Pier jumped into the sea to escape. Some even knocked the enemy soldiers escorting them off the vehicle and jumped off themselves to escape. On June 10th, a fishmonger caught at Haibo Bridge drew a knife and wounded a conscription officer before fleeing. On the same day, conscription officers even apprehended a military officer. After the officer's explanation of his identity proved ineffective, he ordered his subordinates to open fire, and the two sides fought for a long time. Five or six members of the enemy's Youth Army went to Wujia Village to conscript, and were met with gunfire from the village's self-defense force. The self-defense force of Zhongjiawa also engaged in battle with enemy troops conscripting soldiers for a long time in early June. On June 12th, when the enemy conscripted in the city, many shops closed their doors, resembling a strike, to show their opposition. The families of the conscripted citizens published notices and letters in the puppet assembly, accusing the enemy of the crime of conscription, or went to the enemy's "Pacification Commissioner's Office" to petition, demanding their release. It is reported that due to military setbacks and dwindling sources of soldiers, the enemy in Shandong is attempting to conscript 20,000 soldiers in the latter half of this year in a few isolated strongholds such as Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai, and has set a deadline for Qingdao to conscript 5,000 by the end of September.

　　青岛人民反抗抓丁
    【新华社华东二十六日电】综合青岛报纸消息：六月中旬以来，青市经常笼罩在抓丁恐怖中，居民纷作消极或积极的反抗，每逢出门，即联络多人，以防势单被抓，有的更怀揣石头，准备遇抓时反抗。每当敌军用汽车停下或敌军集体出来时，市民即远远逃避。一听说抓丁，街上顿时行人断绝。被抓者大喊大叫，拼死反抗，得机会即逃跑。前海栈桥有一木匠被抓，即跳入海中逃生。有的甚至将押车敌军打下车去，自己跳车逃跑。六月十日海泊桥被抓的一位鱼贩，就曾抽出刀子将抓丁者刺伤后逃走。同日抓丁者甚至将一军官抓住，该军官在说明自己身份无效后，乃指挥所属开枪，双方格斗多时。敌青年军五、六人到吴家村抓丁，遭村自卫队开枪射击。仲家洼的自卫队亦在六月初旬与抓丁的敌军交战多时。六月十二日敌在市内抓丁时，许多商店均关门，形同罢市，以为对抗。被抓的市民家属，则纷纷登报及投书伪参议会，控诉敌抓丁罪行，或赴敌“绥靖公署”请愿，要求释放。按山东敌在军事失利，兵源枯竭中，企图于今年度下半年在济南、青岛、烟台等少数孤立据点征兵两万人，并限青岛于九月底以前抓足五千。
