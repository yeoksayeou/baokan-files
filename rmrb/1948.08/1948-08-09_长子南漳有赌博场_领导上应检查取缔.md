    Gambling Den in Nanzhang, Changzi
    Leaders Should Investigate and Ban It
    Editor: Currently, the great production movement is underway, but there are still many people gambling in Nanzhang Town, Changzi. A newly liberated peasant told me: in the Nanzhang gambling den (playing cards), winnings and losses of 300,000 to 2 million are common. Some people in Nanzhang and Beizhang carry money around every day looking for people to gamble with. This newly liberated peasant lost more than 10,000 yuan there. Based on this situation, I think the gambling atmosphere in Nanzhang must be quite strong. Isn't the local Second District Office and the Nanzhang village cadres aware of this behavior, which hinders production and affects social order? Why haven't they immediately prohibited it?

### 长子南漳有赌博场  领导上应检查取缔

    长子南漳有赌博场
    领导上应检查取缔
    编辑同志：目前正开展大生产运动，长子南漳镇还有不少人赌博。一个新翻身的农民对我说：南漳赌博场（打牌）三、二十万的输赢是平常的事。南漳、北漳有些人每天提着票子找人赌博。这位新翻身的农民就曾在那里输了一万多元。根据这种情况，我想南漳的赌博空气一定相当浓厚，这种妨碍生产、影响社会秩序的行为，难道当地的二区公所及南漳村干部就不知道吗？为什么不立即禁止呢？
