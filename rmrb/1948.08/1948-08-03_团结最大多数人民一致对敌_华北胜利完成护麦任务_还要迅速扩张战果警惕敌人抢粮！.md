【Our Newspaper Dispatches】A reporter from the North China General Branch commented on the situation of the wheat protection struggle, saying: Now, the border areas of the North China Liberated Area have successively and victoriously completed the task of defending the wheat harvest and reported good news one after another, which is a major victory. Recalling the situation around the June wheat harvest, the situation was once serious; the enemy convened special meetings to make detailed arrangements for seizing wheat; Yan Xishan's plan was to seize all the wheat in the central Shanxi plains and establish a defense line in the mountains, extending towards our liberated areas: "Seize if you can, destroy if you can't." In Tianjin, Beiping, the Daqing River area north of Beiping, and southern Chahar, Fu Zuoyi adopted the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls" policy of destructive "mopping-up" operations against the people in the border areas. On the south bank of the Yellow River, in counties such as Wenshang, Changqing, and Dongping, Chiang Kai-shek's troops frantically seized and burned wheat, creating no-man's-lands. In northern Henan, Chiang Kai-shek's troops even established joint defense headquarters in various counties, combining military plunder with political deception, and seizing wheat in stages in a planned manner. In areas such as Xiuwu, they first plundered all the harvesting tools of the people, and then came to calmly rob them. In order to seize wheat, the enemy dispatched all their forces, with the main force cooperating with local bandits, and also organized "People's Defense Forces," "Self-Defense Regiments," "Wheat-Seizing Teams," "Homecoming Legions," etc., using a large number of refugees and famine victims to plunder like locusts. This situation initially caused pessimism among some of the masses, who thought that "anyway, the wheat cannot be eaten." And a small number of district and village cadres in the border areas became confused in their thinking, asking to "go up the mountains," and the struggle was once in a passive position.

The June wheat protection order in North China greatly encouraged the struggle on the entire front. At that time, the party and government in various border areas made a relatively clear analysis of the nationwide victory situation and the local enemy-us struggle situation, realizing that the enemy was trapped and struggling to the death, and was not "strong" at all. The key to reversing the situation lies in our active offensive. Subsequently, various places successively put forward slogans such as "Unite against the enemy, force back the enemy's wheat-seizing strongholds," "Protecting wheat is protecting life, armed protection of people of all classes," "Organize guerrilla groups, unified leadership, and carry out armed protection of wheat," etc. This marked the beginning of our entire army and people turning to the initiative. Since then, the situation on the entire front has changed. In Xiuwu County alone, armed escorts were provided for the rush harvesting of more than 67,000 mu of wheat fields, and 90% of the summer grain has been hidden, shattering more than ten large-scale wheat-seizing invasions by hundreds to two thousand enemies. The enemy was completely forced back to isolated strongholds. In central Shanxi, under the powerful offensive of our army, the people there happily ate their own wheat for the first time. In areas with serious war conditions, such as Changqing and Dongping, our army took the initiative to strike the enemy and retrieved all the wheat seized by the enemy and returned it to the masses. As of now, reports of victory in wheat protection have been pouring in from various places, and most areas have harvested, threshed, and stored the wheat, and inflicted no small casualties on the wheat-seizing enemy.

    团结最大多数人民一致对敌
    华北胜利完成护麦任务
    还要迅速扩张战果警惕敌人抢粮！
    【本报讯】华北总分社记者评述护麦斗争形势称：现在华北解放区各边沿地区已先后胜利地完成了保卫麦收任务，纷纷告捷，这是一个重大胜利。回忆六月麦收前后，当时形势曾一度严重；敌人召集专门会议作了严密的抢麦部署；阎匪锡山的计划是抢光晋中平川小麦，并在山地建立防线，向我解放区伸张：“能抢就抢，抢不走就毁掉”。平津及大清河北察南等地，傅匪作义采用日寇三光政策，向边沿区人民进行毁灭性的“扫荡”。黄河南岸汶上长清东平等县蒋匪疯狂抢麦、烧麦，制造无人区。豫北蒋匪更设立了各县联防指挥部，将武力掠夺和政治欺骗结合，有步骤的分期抢麦，他们在修武等地，第一步先将老百姓收割工具掠夺一空，然后再来从容打劫。为了夺麦，敌人曾出动了全部兵力，以主力配合土蒋，还组织了什么“民卫军”，“自卫团”，“抢麦小组”，“还乡团”等，大量利用难民和饥民象蝗虫一样地四出抢掠。这种形势，在斗争初期曾引起部分群众的悲观情绪，以为“反正麦子吃不成了”。而边地少数区村干部思想上发生迷惘，要求“上山”，斗争曾一时陷于被动。
    六月华北地区的护麦令，大大鼓舞了全线斗争，当时边沿区各地党和政府对全国胜利形势及当地敌我斗争形势作了比较清醒的分析，认识到敌人是在困守，垂死挣扎，并不是什么“强大”。扭转关键则在于我之主动的进攻，接着各地相继提出了“团结对敌，逼退敌人抢麦据点”，“保麦就是保命，武装保护各阶层人民”，“组识游击集团，一元化领导，进行武装保麦”等口号，这标志着我全体军民转入主动的开始。从此全线形势为之一变，仅修武一县即武装掩护抢收了六万七千多亩麦田，百分之九十的夏粮均已藏好，粉碎数百以至两千敌人连续十余次的大规模抢麦进犯。将敌人完全逼退至孤立据点。晋中在我军强大攻势下，该地人民第一次欢快地吃到了自己的麦子。战争情况严重地区如长清东平一带，我军则主动击敌，将敌人抢走的麦子全部夺回又退还了群众。截至目前为止，各地纷纷报告护麦捷音，大部地区都将麦子收、打、藏好，并给了抢麦敌人以不小的杀伤。
