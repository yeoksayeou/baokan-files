Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: The Hong Kong Huashang Daily published on June 23rd a statement by Guo Moruo, Ma Xulun, Shen Zhiyuan, Jian Bozan, Deng Chumin, Qian Jiaju, Zeng Zhaolun and nineteen other directors of the General Association and branch associations of the Chinese Academic Workers Association remaining in Hong Kong. The statement opposed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and traitorous actions, and supported the CCP Central Committee's "May 1st" slogan. The statement declared: "We believe that the fifth item of the CCP's 'May 1st' slogan, which calls on all democratic parties, people's organizations, and social elites to promptly convene a Political Consultative Conference, discuss and implement the convocation of a People's Representative Assembly, and establish a democratic coalition government, points out a path of truth in a very timely manner, a unique path to victory urgently demanded by all Chinese people. We express our high and warm respect to the CCP, because this call proves that all its struggles are indeed for our people and for our democracy." "This is completely different from the reactionary clique using the people to seize power and then plundering the fruits of victory from the people. We believe that the CCP's 'May 1st' slogan is the only correct path to solving national affairs and is also the path on which Chinese academia relies for its development. Apart from this, any attempt to compromise with the reactionaries is extremely dangerous, and the path of one-party, one-class dictatorship is also completely unworkable in China today. However, in order to quickly realize the New Political Consultative Conference and organize a people's regime, we must intensify our efforts to eliminate the dictatorial and traitorous ruling clique that is abhorred by the people of the whole country." The statement praised the Chinese People's Liberation Areas, calling them the bright side of history, the new side heading for victory, where "the reactionaries have suffered a comprehensive military defeat, and in one-third of the country, the people have freed themselves from the oppression of dictatorship, imperialism, and feudalism, and have become the masters of history." The areas under Kuomintang rule represent the dark side of history, the old side trending towards demise, where the dictatorial, traitorous, corrupt, and oppressive tyranny has caused widespread hunger, bankruptcy, terror, and chaos; in every major city, patriotic movements against hunger, persecution, and the pro-Japanese policies of American imperialism are rising; where "after expelling Japanese imperialism, they immediately welcomed in a more ferocious American imperialism, auctioning off national sovereignty in large quantities, selling from the southeast to the northwest, from the sky to the ground, from the coast to the inland rivers. What is particularly appalling is that the reactionaries not only sing praises of leniency towards Japan, but also shamelessly echo the American imperialist policy of supporting Japan, and recently even openly discuss the traitorous theory of a US-Japan-China coordinated entity. This is to win American aid to prolong the dying breath of the dictatorial rule, but it has also brought an unprecedented and serious new national crisis." The statement emphasized the inevitable victory of the Chinese people, saying: "The demise of fascist dictatorial rule and the victory of the people's democratic regime will soon become a reality, and no one can doubt this."

    中国学术工作者协会声明
    拥护中共五一号召
    消除卖国统治集团
    【新华社陕北三日电】香港华商报六月二十三日刊载中国学术工作者协会总会与分会留港理事郭沫若、马叙伦、沈志远、翦伯赞、邓初民、千家驹、曾昭抡等十九人反对蒋介石独裁卖国，拥护中共中央“五一”口号的声明。声明宣称：“我们认为中共‘五一’口号第五项所号召的各民主党派，各人民团体，各社会贤达迅速召开政协会议，讨论并实行召开人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府，非常合时宜地指出了一条真理之路，一条全中国人民迫切要求的唯一胜利之路，我们对于中共愿意表示崇高而热烈的敬意，因为它这一号召证明了它的一切奋斗，确是为我们人民，为着我们民主。”“这和反动集团利用人民打天下，然后从人民手中劫取胜利果实是迥然不同的。我们认为中共‘五一’口号是解决国是唯一正确的道路。亦是中国学术所赖以发展的道路。除此以外，一切企图与反动派妥协的道路固是危险万分，而一党一阶级专政的道路，在今天中国也是完全行不通的。可是为要迅速实现新政协，组织人民政权，我们必须更加紧努力，提早消除眼前这个为全国人民所痛恶的独裁卖国的统治集团。”声明赞扬中国人民解放区，称为历史的光明面，新的走向胜利的一面，在那里，“反动派在军事上遭受到全面的惨败，在全国三分之一的领土内，人民已摆脱独裁、帝国主义与封建的压迫，成了历史的主宰者。”国民党统治的区域则代表着历史的黑暗一面，旧的趋向死灭的一面，在那里，独裁、卖国、贪污残民的暴政造成普遍饥饿、破产、恐怖、混乱；每一大城市兴起反饥饿、反迫害、反美帝扶日的爱国运动，在那里，“驱除了日帝、却立刻迎进一个更凶狠的美帝，大批拍卖国家主权，从东南卖到西北，从天空卖到地底，从海岸卖到内河，尤其令人咋舌的是反动派不仅高唱对日宽大，而且厚颜附和美帝扶日政策，最近更大谈其美日中协同一体的汉奸论调。这是为的争取美援来延续独裁统治的残命，但又带来了空前严重的新的民族危机。”声明强调中国人民必胜前途称：“法西斯独裁统治的死灭，人民民主政权的胜利不久即将成为事实，这是没有谁可以怀疑的了。”
