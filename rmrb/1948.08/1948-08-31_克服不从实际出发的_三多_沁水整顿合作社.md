Taiyue Telegram: Qinshui cooperatives have many problems in their work. The most important one is the lack of a clear understanding of the idea of "organizing mass production based on reality," which has led to the phenomenon of "three excesses": "Too many non-productive staff, too many businesses, and too much external debt." According to statistics from 28 cooperatives in villages such as Guzhen, there are a total of 498 staff members and workshop workers, of which 140 are non-productive staff and odd-job workers. On average, every two and a half workers have to support one staff member. The staff are idle and unproductive, resulting in losses. Many cooperatives have abandoned the task of organizing mass production. Instead, they are engaged in "whatever your village does, my village does too," taking pride in "many businesses and a large scale." For example, the 28 cooperatives in Guzhen have 136 workshops and retail outlets, most of which mainly provide consumption and cannot organize production. There is a lot of external debt, which often makes it difficult to circulate capital. The aforementioned 28 cooperatives have a total capital of 21,107,794 yuan, of which external debt accounts for 14,460,000 yuan, accounting for 68 percent of the capital. The Shazhuang Cooperative in the Seventh District only has 300,000 yuan in shares, five staff members, and four workers, but it operates a pharmacy, dyeing workshop, flour mill, and machine workshop. It only cares about the large scale and does not ask about the results. In six months, it made a profit of 400,000 yuan, but spent 600,000 yuan, causing the workers to be unwilling to work, the members to withdraw their shares, and the cooperative cadres to be in low spirits, feeling that they cannot make money, the masses do not support them, and their own family production has also collapsed. Based on these circumstances, the county cooperative manager meeting held from the 29th of last month to the 4th of this month determined the direction and method of rectification, clarifying that the cooperative is an economic organization for mass production, and its task is to focus on organizing mass production. Therefore, businesses that are not necessary for the local people should be resolutely removed. Unnecessary staff should be resolutely reduced. In addition to a living wage (food and clothing), staff should also receive appropriate dividends, but this must be discussed and decided by the members. For the recovery of external debts, it is necessary to respond to the organization of debtors to produce and earn money to repay.

　　克服不从实际出发的“三多”
  　沁水整顿合作社
    【太岳电】沁水合作社工作中存在许多问题。最主要的一个是“从实际出发组织群众生产”的思想不明确，产生了“三多”现象：“不生产的职员多、业务多、外欠多”。据固镇等村的二十八个合作社统计：职员和作坊工人共四百九十八人，不直接从事生产的职员和杂务人员就有一百四十人。平均两个半工人就得养活一个职员。职员闲着无事生产效率很低，因此赔本。不少合作社把组织群众生产的事放开了。而是“你村搞个啥，我村也搞个啥”，以“业务多，摊子大”为光荣。就以固镇等二十八个合作社说，作坊、门市部有一百三十六处，其中多以供给消费为主，不能组织生产。外欠很多，常常资本周转不灵，上述二十八个合作社资金共二千一百一十万七千七百九十四元，外欠即占去了一千四百四十六万元，占资金的百分之六十八。七区沙庄合作社股金只三十万，职员五人，工人四人，经营了药铺、染坊、粉坊、和机坊，只贪图摊子大，不问结果如何，六个月营利四十万，却开支了六十万，弄得工人不愿干，社员要抽股，合作干部情绪也不高，感到赚不了钱，群众不拥护，自己家里生产也垮了。根据这些情况，上月二十九日至本月四日召开的全县合作社经理会议，确定了整顿的方针与办法，明确合作社是群众生产的经济组织，任务以组织群众生产为主。因此，不是当地群众所必须的业务，应坚决去掉。不必要的职员应坚决裁减。职员待遇够生活（衣食）外，再应适当分红，但须经社员讨论决定。外欠的催收，响应组织欠户生产赚钱来归还。
