TASS dispatch: Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, delivered a speech at a mass rally held in Kiskunfélegyháza to celebrate "New Harvest Day," pointing out the achievements of Hungarian production and construction, saying: "The Hungarian people are looking back on the past three years with the mood of completing their work quickly. The production level in the past five months has exceeded the pre-war level by 23 percent. The nationalization of industries employing more than 100 workers has greatly increased the level of production. The fiscal year 1947 (ending August 1 this year) had a surplus of 140 million forints, and wages are also increasing. In the past two years, the living standards of the working people have increased by 43 percent. At present, 4.6 million quintals of new grain have been paid to the government, thus making it possible to increase the bread ration and improve its quality in various cities." When discussing the future of Hungarian agriculture, Rakosi pointed out: "The Hungarian democratic government will make every effort to help farmers organize agricultural cooperatives." Rakosi also declared: "The ruling parties and mass organizations will issue a new program for the National Independence Front and complete the reorganization of the Independence Front by next spring."
