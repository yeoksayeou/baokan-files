Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th—The People's Liberation Army has recently uncovered seven Japanese officers from among the captured Kuomintang soldiers in the Yanzhou campaign. They are: First Lieutenant Instructor of the 112th Brigade Headquarters of the Reorganized 12th Division, Fuji Takataka (renamed Teng Xiaoxian); Second Lieutenant Instructor of the 111th Brigade Headquarters of the Reorganized 12th Division, Iwasaki Toshimitsu (renamed Hua Yanmin); First Lieutenant Communications Officer of the Reorganized 12th Army Headquarters, Yamashita Ryohei (renamed Zhao Guoliang); Second Lieutenant Military Doctor of the Reorganized 12th Army Medical Department, Oshima Kunitaro (renamed Wang Langzhen); Second Lieutenant Military Doctor, Yamaginji (renamed Li Jinshan); Second Lieutenant Surveyor of the Army's Staff Department, Fujita Fuminami (renamed Li Zhenjiang); and Warrant Officer Gunner of the 3rd Company of the Artillery Battalion of the 111th Brigade of the Reorganized 12th Division, Shinban Yushiro (renamed Xing Qisheng). They were all retained by the Kuomintang army in Jinan after the Japanese surrender. In addition, in the battle to annihilate the Kuomintang 84th Division's 161st Brigade and other units at Dakou on the Da Wen River last month, in addition to the previously reported capture of Major General Xu Rizheng, the brigade commander of the 161st Brigade, a preliminary investigation has now revealed that there are also Colonel Lü Huanzhang, the commander of the 482nd Regiment of the 161st Brigade; Lieutenant Colonel Luo Yan, the chief of staff of the 161st Brigade Headquarters; Lieutenant Colonel Wang Qionglin, the deputy commander of the 481st Regiment of the brigade; Lieutenant Colonel Li Jingting, the deputy commander of the 482nd Regiment; Lieutenant Colonel An Yukun, the acting commander of the 483rd Regiment; and more than 250 other field and junior officers.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th—Local backbone regiments and county armed forces in southern Shandong are actively mopping up scattered bandits in coordination with the People's Liberation Army's offensive. A certain backbone regiment, in coordination with the local armed forces of Feixian and Mengshan (a newly established county northeast of Feixian), took advantage of the victory after the Yanzhou campaign and advanced into Linyi, capturing the enemy stronghold of Lingshi. At dawn on the 23rd, they also crushed a regiment of the enemy's main force that attempted to retaliate at Guojialingshi, annihilating 275 enemies. The local armed forces of Lincheng (the county seat of Lincheng Town) entered the west of the Jinpu Railway and the east bank of Weishan Lake on July 3, in coordination with a unit of the backbone corps, and successively recovered enemy strongholds such as Xiazhen and Huancheng, annihilating a unit of the Shandong Water Police that remained in Weishan Lake. At present, all five districts east of Weishan Lake in the county, except for a few villages in one district close to Lincheng, have been liberated by us. The local armed forces of Fushan (a newly established county between Tengxian and Jining), in coordination with the People's Liberation Army, intercepted scattered bandits from Yanzhou. On July 14, they took advantage of the victory and recovered Nanyang Town, the only remaining stronghold of the Kuomintang army in the county. The entire territory has now been liberated. In June and July, the county captured more than 1,000 Kuomintang soldiers.
