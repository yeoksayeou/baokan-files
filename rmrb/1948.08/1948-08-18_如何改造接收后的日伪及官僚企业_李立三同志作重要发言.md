　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th: At the Sixth Labor Congress, during the discussion of reports by Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun on the 9th, Comrade Li Lisan delivered an important speech on "The Transformation of Enterprises After Requisitioning Japanese, Puppet, and Kuomintang Bureaucratic Capital Enterprises." The content is divided into four parts, summarized as follows: 1. How to enlighten and raise the class consciousness of the working masses, make them understand the fact that they have changed from slaves to masters of the enterprise, and establish a new labor attitude befitting their master status. 2. How to unite and transform old staff members; how to change their ideological consciousness of looking down on workers and their bureaucratic work style, to achieve equality among employees, mutual assistance, and joint responsibility for improving production. 3. How to reform the old management system and replace it with a new democratic management system. The production organization system should be critically accepted and not changed rashly. The old organization should be appropriately streamlined according to the principles of scientific management and actual needs, reducing unnecessary personnel, but preventing the organization from becoming too simple. Managing modern large enterprises with handicraft-style methods is not appropriate. 4. Regarding the steps and methods of transformation. Transformation is a long-term process of democratization, and it is necessary to prevent the two deviations of impatience and conservatism. In his concluding remarks, Comrade Lisan especially pointed out that the reports of Comrades Gao Gang and Chen Yun should be the guiding principles of this congress, and the program and goals for the future struggles of the working class throughout the country.

　　如何改造接收后的日伪及官僚企业
  　李立三同志作重要发言
    【新华社东北十六日电】第六次劳动大会于九日讨论高岗同志及陈云同志的报告中，李立三同志就“接收日伪和国民党官僚资本企业后的企业改造问题”，作了重要发言。内容计分四部分，摘要如下：一、如何启发和提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，使其了解从奴隶变成了企业主人翁的事实，而树立起新的主人翁地位的劳动态度。二、如何团结和改造旧职员；如何改变他们轻视工人的思想意识和官僚主义的作风，以达到员工平等，员工互助，共同负责提高生产的目的。三、如何改革旧管理制度而代之以新的民主的管理制度。对于生产组织制度应采取批判的接受而不应轻率变更。对于旧机构则应根据科学管理原则和实际的需要，加以适当的精简，裁减不必要的人员，但要防止把机构弄得过于简单。用手工业式的办法来管理现代大企业，是不适宜的。四、关于改造的步骤和方法。改造是长期的民主化过程，要防止急性病与保守主义的两种偏向。立三同志在结语中特别指出：高岗同志和陈云同志的报告应是这次大会的指导方针，和今后全国工人阶级的奋斗的纲领和目标。
