Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: TASS reports: This year, the Eastern European New Democratic countries, like the Soviet Union, are celebrating a bumper harvest. Poland's cultivated area this year exceeds 14 million hectares, one million hectares more than last year, and the harvest in many regions will be twice that of last year. Therefore, this year it will no longer be necessary to import grain from foreign countries. The Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture estimates that this year's crop harvest will exceed the original target of the Three-Year Plan by 8 percent. The total wheat harvest this year will exceed 14.3 million quintals (one quintal equals 100 catties), exceeding last year by 43 percent. The rye harvest will reach 6.5 million quintals. Corn 30 million quintals, potatoes 20 million quintals. Thanks to the use of Soviet seeds, the sugar beet harvest will be sufficient to produce 20,000 carloads of sugar—more than double last year. Romania has a bumper harvest this year, and the grain delivery plan is being successfully implemented. Czechoslovakia, which suffered from the worst drought in decades last year, began harvesting its abundant crops in early July. Many industrial workers and civil servants have been mobilized to help farmers with the harvest. With the large-scale supply of machinery, 21,000 tractors, 76,000 various harvesters, and many combine harvesters are being used in the harvest. The increasingly widespread use of agricultural machinery has become a common feature of the countryside in the New Democratic countries after land reform. In Poland, machine rental cooperatives are playing a major role in the harvest, and 4,000 villages will use electric threshing machines during the harvest.

    东欧新民主国家土改后
    改良种子使用农业机器
    耕种面积扩大产量增加
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社讯：东欧各新民主国家今年与苏联同样喜庆丰收，波兰今年耕种面积超过一千四百万公顷，较去年多一百万公顷，而许多地区收获量将达去年的两倍，因此今年可以不必再自外国输入谷物。匈牙利农业部估计今年农作物收成将超过三年计划原定额的百分之八。今年小麦收获总量将超过一千四百三十万生丁纳（一生丁纳合一百市斤），超过去年达百分之四十三。裸麦收获量将达六百五十万生丁纳。玉蜀黍三千万生丁纳，洋芋二千万生丁纳，由于采用了苏联种子，甜菜收获量将足供生产二万车厢的食糖——超过去年一倍。罗马尼亚今年丰收，纳粮计划正胜利实现中。去年遭到数十年未有的严重旱灾的捷克，已于七月初开始收割丰硕的作物，许多工业工人、公务员，都动员起来帮助农民收割，在机器工业大量供应之下，有二万一千架拖拉机，七万六千架各种收割机与许多联合收割机应用于收割工作。农业机器之日益广泛的使用，已成为新民主国家土改后的农村中共同的特点。在波兰的机器租赁合作社在收获中起重大作用，有四千所村庄将在收获中使用电动打谷机。
