Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Hanoi: The Vietnamese traitor Nguyen Van Xuan recently lamented at a press conference, saying, "It is impossible to crush the resistance movement by military means." Even if Vietnamese territory is occupied, "the hearts of the Vietnamese people will still be lost." He admitted that his cabinet "cannot accomplish anything." According to a Reuters report from Saigon: Although Nguyen Van Xuan and France signed an agreement in June on establishing an "independent unified state" within the French Federation, including the three regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina, his "work has become increasingly difficult." "The leader of the national resistance movement, Ho Chi Minh, refuses to recognize the above agreement and continues to fight with the support of the majority of the people. Not a single member of the resistance movement agrees to serve in the (puppet) central government. Nguyen has not gained the trust of the non-combatant class in the country and is openly denounced as a Vietnamese traitor.

　　越奸阮文春悲鸣
  　抵抗运动打不垮
    【新华社陕北八日电】据法新社河内消息：越奸阮文春日前在记者招待会上发出悲鸣说：“以军事手段打垮抵抗运动是不可能的”，即使占据了越南的领土，“越南人心也仍会失去”。他自认他的内阁“不能有所作为”。另据路透社西贡消息：尽管阮文春和法国在六月间签订了关于在法兰西联邦内成立一个包括东京、安南、交趾支那三地区的“独立统一国家”的协定，但他的“工作已愈来愈加困难”。“民族抵抗运动的领袖胡志明拒绝承认上述协定，并且继续在大多数人民的拥护下进行斗争。抵抗运动的人员没有一个同意在（伪）中央政府中供职。阮并没有得到国内非战斗阶层的信任，而且被公开痛斥为越奸。
