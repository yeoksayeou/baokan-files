　　Brief Replies
　　To Comrade Wei Zhenghe: Regarding the issue of your millet, cotton, and sea salt stored at the winery being taken away and not returned, it has been forwarded to the Zuoquan County Committee for investigation and resolution.
　　To Comrades Wang Yonghuai and Jia Zhenling: Regarding your letter concerning Comrade Wu Anzhi, a cadre from the Third District of Shexian County, marrying Guo Jinkui's wife from Houyu Village casually, we have forwarded it to the Shexian County Committee, requesting them to investigate the actual situation and resolve it.
　　To Comrade Han Jianxun: Regarding the issue of soldiers terminating marriage engagements, there are explicit regulations in the Provisional Marriage Regulations of the Former Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government. If the fiancée of soldier Han Wenfang requests to terminate the engagement, the county and district governments should handle it according to these regulations. The district government's avoidance of responsibility is incorrect.
　　To Comrade Zhao Bin: Your opinions regarding the Pingding Post Office's distribution of newspapers have been forwarded to them.
　　To Comrade Han Furong: Regarding the issue of your family being evicted from your home, because the letter was too brief and lacked detailed information, we cannot understand the full situation and cannot provide an answer. We have forwarded your letter to the Wu'xiang County Committee, requesting them to investigate and resolve it. If your family is currently unable to sustain themselves, please provide them with appropriate resettlement first.
　　To Comrade Zheng Hongzhang: The criteria for differentiating between middle peasants and rich peasants during class determination should be based on Comrade Ren Bishi's discussion in "Several Questions in Land Reform," that is, if feudal exploitation income exceeds one-quarter (25%) of the total income and continues for three consecutive years, it constitutes the status of a rich peasant.
　　To Comrade Li Jifeng: We have received the cry for help written by you on behalf of correspondent Comrade Xiong Haichi regarding his forced divorce. The district cadre's letter and divorce papers have been sent to the Jinnan Administrative Office as requested, asking them to investigate and resolve it.
　　To Comrade Shen Peiran: This military family member you mentioned, who voluntarily handed over the guns they were trafficking to the government after the government prohibited arms trafficking, should be given appropriate compensation by the government based on the assessed value.
