Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- After the Kuomintang reactionary government announced the so-called "currency reform" on the 19th, reactions from various parties at home and abroad unanimously pointed out that this desperate last struggle could not improve its extremely deteriorated financial and economic situation in the slightest. According to a report from the Diantong News Agency in Hong Kong on the 19th: Regarding this currency reform, "Chinese people in Hong Kong believe that it is a desperate struggle by the Kuomintang regime, attempting to save its impending financial collapse." It also pointed out: "Merely issuing new banknotes cannot stop China's runaway inflation." According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 19th, a foreign exchange broker in Shanghai said: Under China's current circumstances, the most important factor to consider in any fiscal measure is the reaction of the entire Chinese people. And their reaction will inevitably be: "More paper money." This feeling of aversion, contempt, and dissatisfaction is not accidental. As a United Press reporter pointed out in a dispatch from Shanghai on the 20th: This time Chiang bandit implemented currency reform, "is Shanghai's third currency change after the Pearl Harbor Incident. The first time was when the Japanese puppets adopted the Central Reserve Bank notes (1940), forcing people to exchange two yuan of legal tender for one yuan of reserve notes; the second time was to exchange them again for legal tender at a rate of two hundred to one (1945). If someone had savings of 20,000 yuan in the bank before the war, and left it there ever since, then after three exchanges, his net gain would be 0.000016 new gold yuan," "This reveals how the people suffer from currency exchange." According to an Associated Press reporter's dispatch from Shanghai on the 19th, everyone in Shanghai's financial circles he contacted believed: "The regulations announced by the government do not carry any hope of improving China's economic situation." Even Azia, the boss of an American bank in Shanghai, believed that this currency reform was just "exchanging one piece of paper for another, without making any difference" (Associated Press). Therefore, there is only one conclusion, as the "Free Magazine" in Hong Kong said: "As soon as the banknotes start to be exchanged, the new currency will immediately depreciate sharply" (Diantong News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th).

In fact, since the Kuomintang government announced the "currency reform," price fluctuations in various markets have never stopped. According to Agence France-Presse and Reuters news from Shanghai on the 20th: "Since yesterday (the 19th), the black market prices of rice, cooking oil, coal, and flour have all risen by 10 percent." According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai: On the 23rd, "Retail prices of food and other goods continued to rise." Even the Chiang bandit's propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, which has been reporting "declining" prices in various places every day, also revealed on the 24th that in Shanghai, "Yarn, cloth, flour, rayon, and over-the-counter stock transactions rose slightly compared to the 23rd." The price of yarn and cloth in Beiping also continued to rise, and the Yishi Daily, which published the news of the rising yarn and cloth price, has been "ordered to suspend publication for one day" by the pseudo-Beiping Municipal Government. The Northern Daily was also "warned" for the same reason (Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th). As for the prices in other places, the pseudo-Executive Yuan has publicly admitted: "As soon as the four measures were announced, ... news came that prices in various places fluctuated" (Central News Agency); therefore, they had to urgently telegraph the authorities of various provinces and cities on the second day (21st) after the implementation of "currency reform" to "strictly control prices."

The news about black market activities is best explained by the words of a black market merchant in Shanghai. This black market merchant told a United Press reporter: "As long as we can still get US dollars, and legal tender can still be used, or until we haven't seen it more profitable to exchange legal tender for gold yuan notes, we will continue to trade" (United Press, 20th). And the pseudo-Ministry of Interior's urgent telegram to the authorities of various provinces and cities on the 21st to "inspect newspapers and publications in various places every day to see if there are any illegal reports of black market activities in finance and prices" (Central News Agency) is a powerful refutation of the continued existence of black market activities in various places.

From these initial reactions from various parties, rising prices in various places, and black market activities, it is clear that no matter how Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang pretends to call for "currency reform," this move will not help its increasingly deteriorating financial and economic situation, it is widely despised by all parties, and its essence of further sucking the blood of the people is very clear.

### 用一张纸换另一张纸  蒋匪财经情势益恶化　国民党区物价已开始上涨

　　用一张纸换另一张纸
    蒋匪财经情势益恶化
  　国民党区物价已开始上涨
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】国民党反动政府于十九日宣布实行所谓“改革币制”后，中外各方的反应一致指出这一绝望的最后挣扎，不可能丝毫改善其万分恶化的财政经济情况。据电通社十九日香港电讯报导：对于此次改革币制，“香港中国人士认为是国民党政权的绝望挣扎，企图借以挽救其迫在眉睫的财政崩溃”。并指出：“仅仅发行新钞票，不能制止中国狂奔似的通货膨胀”。另据美联社上海十九日消息，上海的一个外汇经纪人称：中国目前情况下，在任何财政措施上所应考虑的最重要的因素，乃是整个中国人民的反应。而其反应必然是：“又是纸币”。这种厌恶、卑视与不满的情绪不是偶然的。如合众社记者二十日自上海发出的电讯所指出：这次蒋贼实行改革币制，“是珍珠港事变后上海的第三次货币更换。第一次是在日伪采用中央储备银行钞票的时候（一九四○年），强迫人民以两元法币换一元储备票；第二次是以二百比一的比率再换为法币（一九四五年）。倘使有人战前在银行有二万元的储蓄，并听其从那时起便存放在那里，则经过三次的兑换后，他的净得是点○○○○一六新金元”，“这透露人民如何因货币兑换而受着苦难”。又据美联社记者十九日自上海发出的消息称，他所接触的上海一切金融界人士都认为：“政府所宣布的条例，并不带有改进中国经济情势的任何希望”。甚至上海的一个美商银行老板艾齐亚亦认为这次改革币制，不过是“把一张纸换成另一张纸，并没有做出任何不同来”（美联社）。因此，结论只有一个，即如香港的“自由杂志”所说的：“一俟钞票开始兑换，新货币即将立刻急剧贬值”（电通社十九日香港电）。
    事实上，自国民党政府宣布“币改”以来，各地市场物价波动就没有停止过。据法新社、路透社二十日上海消息：“自昨日（十九日）以来，米、食油、煤及面粉的黑市价，均已上涨百分之十”。据美联社上海电讯：二十三日“粮食及其他货物零售价格继续上涨”。甚至这几天连日报导各地物价“下跌”的蒋贼造谣机关中央社，也于二十四日透露上海“纱布、面粉、人造丝及股票场外交易，较二十三日微升”。北平方面的纱布也继续上涨，因登载纱布上涨消息的益世报，已被伪北平市政府“勒令停刊一日”。而北方日报也因同样的缘故，“受到警告”（中央社二十四日北平电）。至其他各地的物价，则伪行政院已公开供认：“乃四项办法甫经公布，………消息传来，各地物价间有波动情事”（中央社）；所以不得不于实行“改革币制”后的第二天（二十一），慌忙急电各省市当局“严格管制物价”。
    有关黑市活动的消息，最好是以上海一个黑市商人的话来说明。这个黑市商人对合众社记者说：“只要我们仍能得到美元，法币仍能使用或直到我们尚未见到将法币换为金元券较为有利之前，我们将继续做买卖”（合众社二十日电）。而二十一日伪内政部急电各省市当局，“逐日检查各地报纸刊物，有无违法登载金融及物价之黑市情事”（中央社），更是一个各地黑市继续存在活动的有力反证。
    从这些最初的各方反应，各地物价上涨及黑市活动看来，尽管蒋介石匪帮如何装腔作势的大叫大喊“改革币制”，但此举之无补于其日趋恶化的财政经济情势，它之受到各方广泛的卑视，以及它的进一步吸吮人民膏血的实质，是明明白白的了。
