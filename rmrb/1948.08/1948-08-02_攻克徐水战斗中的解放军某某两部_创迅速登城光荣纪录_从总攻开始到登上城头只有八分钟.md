    PLA Units Conquer Xushui in Battle, Set Glorious Record for Rapid Ascent
    Only Eight Minutes from Start of General Offensive to Scaling the Walls
    [Pingbao Frontline Dispatch] In the battle to liberate Xushui city on the Pingbao line on July 22nd, certain units of the North China People's Liberation Army, from the start of the general offensive to scaling the city walls, took only seven or eight minutes, setting a glorious record for rapid ascent. When the general offensive began, the enemy's fortifications on the city walls and the large central blockhouse on the north wall instantly collapsed under the continuous bombardment of our artillery. Amidst this earth-shattering barrage, a demolition team from the 5th Company of a certain unit, which had rushed to the north gate of the city, blew up the city gate in two minutes. The four-ladder team set up the ladders in less than three minutes. As the assault team was about to ascend the walls, the ladder suddenly tilted. Xu Deli, the ladder team leader, disregarded his own hip injury and, together with the entire team, held the ladder firmly, ensuring the assault team successfully scaled the walls. Squad Leader Wang Huaide was the first to jump onto the city wall, where he saw enemy soldiers inside the city also climbing along the wall, attempting to counterattack. He threw two hand grenades, blasting the enemy tumbling down. At this time, the demolition team also charged into the city through the breached gate and ascended the walls from inside the city. This unit took only seven minutes from the start of the general offensive to scaling the walls. Similarly, after the general offensive began, the 1st Company of a certain unit, attacking the south gate, also advanced bravely under the cover of intense artillery fire. Demolition hero Xu Shiying led the demolition team rushing towards the city gate, advancing to a point about 20 or 30 meters from the gate. Machine gun fire from the protruding section of the city wall to the west raked them severely, and Xu Shiying was wounded. Wang Dexian, a new recruit in his team, immediately picked up the demolition charge from his hands and continued to advance, blowing up the city gate and collapsing half of the city wall. The 10th Squad of the unit, carrying ladders, was unable to advance due to enemy crossfire. The 2nd Squad of the unit, without waiting for the 11th Squad to take over carrying the ladders, shouted, "We'll carry the ladders!" and propped the ladders up. At this point, the ladders were again blocked by enemy fire from the left flank, preventing the assault team from going up. Zhang Fuzhen, the deputy company commander of the 1st Company, became anxious, ran into the city gate opening, and climbed up the collapsed city wall. The loosened earth slipped with each step, but he finally became the first to climb onto the city wall, and disregarding the enemy fire from both sides and the bunkers in the street, he repelled the enemy to the east and even captured a machine gun. At this time, troops all ascended the wall from here and advanced forward. This unit took only eight minutes from the start of the general offensive to scaling the walls.

    攻克徐水战斗中的解放军某某两部
    创迅速登城光荣纪录
    从总攻开始到登上城头只有八分钟
    【平保前线电】华北解放军某某两部，于七月二十二日协同攻克平保线徐水城战斗中，从总攻开始到登城，仅七、八分钟，创造了迅速登城之光荣纪录。当总攻开始时，在我军排炮连续轰击下，敌城上的防御工事和北城中央的大堡垒刹时间全部垮台了。就在这震天的炮击中，突至该城北门的某部五连爆破组，又在两分钟内爆破了城门。四梯子组，没三分钟就架好了梯子。当突击队将要登城时，梯子突然倾斜，梯子组长徐得利不顾自己臀部负伤，和全班一齐按住梯子，保证突击队顺利的登上城头。班长王怀德首先跳上城头，看见城里敌人也正沿着城墙往上爬，企图反扑。他摔了两个手榴弹，把敌人炸翻滚了下去。这时，爆破组也从炸开了的城门里冲进城里，从城里登城。该部从总攻开始到登城仅七分钟。同样，在总攻开始之后，进攻南门的某部一连也在猛烈炮火掩护下，奋勇前进。爆炸英雄许世英，率领爆破组向城门飞跑过去，前进到距城门约二、三十公尺的地方，城墙西面突出部敌人的机枪猛烈侧射，许世英挂了花，他们组里的新战士王德贤紧拾起他手中的爆破雷，继续前进，炸开城门，并把城墙也炸塌了半边。抬梯子的该部第十班，被敌人火力侧射，不能前进，该部二班不等着十一班接替抬梯子，就喊：“我们抬梯子！”把梯子靠好，这时，梯子又遭敌人左侧火力封锁，突击队不能上去。一连副连长张福振急了，跑到城门洞里，顺着塌了的城墙往上爬。被炸松的土，一上一滑，但他终于第一名爬上城头，并不顾两边及街中碉垒的敌人火力射击，打退了东边敌人，还缴了一挺机枪。这时，部队都由这里登城，向前发展。该部从总攻开始到登城仅八分钟。
