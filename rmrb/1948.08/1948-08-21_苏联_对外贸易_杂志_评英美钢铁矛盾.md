Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 19th: TASS reported on the 15th that the Soviet "Foreign Trade" magazine recently published a commentary pointing out that since the end of the war, competition between Britain and the United States in steel exports has been increasing. The magazine stated that Britain has been forced to concede its position to the United States. US steel exports to Western European countries increased by 27 percent last year compared to the previous year, while Britain's fell by 40.5 percent at the same time, less than one-third of the United States'. Britain's markets in France, Italy, and Sweden have been particularly weakened. Last year, US steel product exports to France were 24 times greater than Britain's, and to Italy 36 times greater than Britain's. In almost all markets of countries accepting the Marshall Plan, US imperialism has occupied a dominant position. Not only that, its steel exports have also expanded to British dominions and colonies, as well as Latin American markets, rapidly crowding out Britain. For example, in Argentina last year, Britain's steel exports to the country were only slightly higher than pre-war levels, while the United States increased by more than 29 times, exceeding Britain's exports to Argentina by about 6.5 times. The "Foreign Trade" magazine concluded that the expansionist elements in the United States' great march to obtain world domination can only exacerbate contradictions within the imperialist camp, because even weakened imperialist competitors are unwilling to cede their positions to the United States without a fight. The maturing economic crisis is making the market struggle even more intense.

  　评英美钢铁矛盾
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社十五日讯：苏联“对外贸易”杂志顷发表评论，指出自战争结束以来，英美间在钢铁输出方面的竞争日渐增长。该杂志称：英国被迫将其地位让给美国，美国钢输至西欧各国者，去年较前年增加百分之二十七，而英国则于同时下降百分之四十点五，不及美国的三分之一。英国在法、意、瑞典的市场特别被削弱，去年美国的钢产品对法国的输出较英国大二十四倍，对意的输出则较英国大三十六倍。在几乎所有接受马歇尔计划的国家的市场上，美帝国主义占据了统治地位。不仅如此，它的钢铁输出还扩张到英国自治领和殖民地以及拉丁美洲各国市场，迅速地排挤英国。例如在阿根廷，去年英国对该国的钢铁输出仅稍稍高出战前水平，而美国却增加了二十九倍以上，超过英国对阿根廷的输出约六点五倍。“对外贸易”杂志结语称：美国扩张主义分子为获取世界统治权的大进军，只能加剧帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，因为甚至已削弱了的帝国主义竞争者也不愿不经斗争就把他们的地位让给美国。正在成熟中的经济危机使市场斗争更加紧张。
