Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. The Kuomintang government's permission for Japanese ships to come to China to transport the 200,000 tons of Kailuan coal and 40,000 tons of Taiwanese sugar recently sold to Japan has aroused strong opposition from the shipping industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. According to a United Press report from Shanghai on July 27th, the Shanghai shipping industry will take "independent action," namely establishing a private blockade with Chinese ships to prevent Japanese ships from entering the port, and urging all dock coolies not to load goods onto Japanese ships. According to a Central News Agency report: Both negotiations regarding the sale of Kailuan coal and Taiwanese sugar were conducted through the Kuomintang Central Trust Bureau and the U.S. military headquarters stationed in Japan. Two representatives from the Kailuan Coal Mine Administration even flew to Tokyo on June 30th to directly participate in the negotiations. It is reported that the first batch of 25,000 tons of Taiwanese sugar sold to Japan by the Kuomintang government earlier this year was entirely transported by Japanese ships. Other goods, such as yesterday's salt, are also frequently transported by Japanese ships. Furthermore, according to a United Press report from Shanghai on July 31st, citing news from Taipei: The Taiwan Shipping Association has announced its support for the Shanghai Chinese Shipping Association's decision to prevent Japanese ships from coming to China, and has decided to adopt the various measures stipulated in the resolution.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th. According to the Qingdao Minbao: The Qingdao shipping industry issued a declaration on July 4th during the Maritime Day commemoration, protesting against the Kuomintang government's selling out of inland waterway rights. The declaration described the suffering of the Chinese shipping industry under the Kuomintang government's traitorous policies, stating: "After the navigation rights are seized, what is the loss to the shipping industry, is it only four hundred million in US loans? Can several hundred million compensate for the sovereignty of the country?" The declaration pointed out: "Looking at Qingdao, which is a first-class Chinese seaport, the docks are full of U.S. flag warships, and Chinese small merchant ships often have no place to stand when entering the port. Is this on our own territory?" The declaration repeatedly proclaimed: "We will definitely resolutely resist to the end."

According to the newspaper's June 1st issue: The US Navy stationed in Qingdao has recently built railways and oil pipelines between the Qingdao Dagang dock and Cangkou. It is also rumored that the US will establish a shipyard in Qingdao.
