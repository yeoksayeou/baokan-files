Learning from Xiang Tishui to Get Rich Through Diligence and Thrift
　　United Production by the Masses in Beizhuang, Huguan
[Taihang News] The party members, cadres, and masses in Beizhuang, Huguan, are learning from Comrade Xiang Tishui, clarifying their thinking, and uniting to engage in production. After the district cadres stationed in the village returned from a county meeting, they convened a branch meeting and a production committee meeting. Through reviewing and reflecting on their work, they clarified to the cadres and party members that the land issue in the village had been resolved, dispelling the idea that everyone was waiting for land reform and not focusing on production. They also organized cadres and party members to study the news report from the June 24th issue of the Xinhua Daily about Xiang Tishui's correct understanding of the party rectification policy and his insistence on leading production. People said, "Party rectification is supposed to transform the party, educate party members, and let everyone do things well for the masses. But we are not like that; we are afraid of party rectification, afraid of the masses raising opinions, and we are lying down and not doing anything. Frankly speaking, we are not even one percent as good as Xiang Tishui. If we work like Xiang Tishui, the masses will definitely support us." After several discussions, most of the cadres and party members in the village actively started leading the masses in production. Yang Anbao (deputy secretary), the manager of the cooperative, is a disabled veteran who lost a leg. He was in low spirits in the previous period but is now full of energy and leading the consolidation of mutual aid. He has already cleared up the old accounts of his small cooperative and distributed dividends, which the masses are very satisfied with. The Yunze team also voluntarily merged into his small cooperative, expanding the working capital by 300,000 yuan. Yang Yingsheng, the director of the armed forces committee, had a very bad style in the past. He himself said, "In the entire Shili district, it's hard to find someone with a worse style than me." He is determined to learn a democratic style and work well for the welfare of the masses. He led four people and collected 1,400 catties of wool in four days, earning 420,000 yuan, and was immediately elected by the masses as the general leader of sideline production for the entire village. Village head, branch secretary, production director, and other cadres are also actively leading production. Deputy Village Head Yang Jiansheng rarely paid attention to production work in the past, but now he not only actively leads everyone in formulating production plans but also personally leads a mutual aid group in production. After the ideological problems of the cadres were resolved, enthusiastic discussions were also launched among the masses. They recognized that the central task at present is to actively engage in production on the basis of the already achieved liberation, to get rich through diligence and thrift like Xiang Tishui, breaking the middle peasants' fear of equal distribution and the poor peasants' mentality of waiting for equal distribution, and clarifying the direction for everyone to unite and engage in production. Middle peasant Yang Kuizhong was raising two livestock (one cow and one donkey), but after the Land Law Outline was issued, he didn't feed them well, fearing that his livestock would be taken during equal distribution. After learning about Xiang Tishui's success story, he regretted not having engaged in production well during this period, resulting in great losses. He immediately spent four days smoking 100 bundles of wasteland bark on the mountain and bought more than 200 feet of native cloth for trading, and planned to use the profits from sideline production to buy grain, achieving "cultivating three and saving one." Poor peasants like Yang Quncai, etc., sat and waited for equal distribution every day after the Land Law Outline was issued. They bought cloth from the cooperative without paying, but now they also realize that it is disgraceful to sit and eat without engaging in production, so they have actively started production. They have already hoed the autumn fields twice, applied 200 loads of topdressing fertilizer, and taken time out to do five days of hired labor, earning half a dou of wheat. In the meantime, compensation was also made to the middle peasants whose interests had been infringed upon. After learning from Xiang Tishui, the masses in the entire village have clarified that Xiang Tishui's path is the correct path to get rich through production. Currently, with the united production of the middle and poor peasants in the village, the autumn seedlings are undergoing the third hoeing and have been topdressed with 9,787 loads of fertilizer. They also take time out to do hired labor and engage in sideline production, already earning more than 650,000 yuan in silver dollars.

　　学习向提水勤俭致富
  　壶关北庄群众团结生产
    【太行讯】壶关北庄党员干部和群众向向提水同志学习，澄清思想，团结闹生产。住该村的区干部自县开会回来，召开支部会和生产委员会议，以检讨回顾工作的方式，使干部党员明确认识本村土地问题已解决了，解除了大家等土改不安心生产的思想。又组织干部党员学习六月二十四日新华日报所载向提水正确了解整党政策，坚持领导生产的消息。人们都说：“整党本来为改造党，教育党员，让大家好好为群众办事情，可咱不是这样，怕整党，怕群众提意见，躺着不干，说起来咱十分抵不住提水一分，要照住人家提水那样去干，群众一定会拥护咱。”经过数次讨论，该村大部干部党员便积极起来带领群众搞开生产了。合作社经理杨安保同志（副支书）是个掉了一条腿的荣退军人，在前一时期情绪低落，现在生气勃勃领导整顿互助，已把他那个小型合作社旧帐清理完毕，分了红，群众很满意。云则组也自愿并入了他的小型社，扩大了三十万元活动资金。武委会主任杨英胜过去作风十分恶劣，他自己也说：“在十里小区，难能挑出比我作风更坏的人来。”他决心学习民主作风，很好的为群众谋福利，他带了四个人，四天时间收了一千四百斤羊毛，赚回四十二万元，立即被群众选为全村副业生产的总领导者。村长、支书、生产主任等干部，也积极领导生产。副村长杨建生过去对生产工作很少睬理，现在不仅积极领导大家订生产计划，还亲自领导了一个互助小组进行生产。干部思想解决之后，又在群众中展开热烈的讨论，认识当前的中心任务是在已有的翻身基础上积极生产，如向提水一样勤俭劳作发家致富，打破了中农怕平分、贫农等平分的思想，明确了大家团结闹生产的方向。中农杨魁中喂着两个牲口（牛驴各一），土地法大纲下来后，也不好好喂了，怕平分时牵他的牲口。当他学习了向提水发家消息后，后悔这一段没很好生产，损失太大了。立即以四天工夫在山上薰了一百担荒皮，又买了二百多尺土布作买卖，并计划以副业生产的获利买成粮食，做到耕三余一。贫农杨群才等在土地法大纲下来后，每天坐着等平分，在合作社买上布也不给钱，现在也认识了坐着吃不生产是不光彩的，因而积极生产开了，秋地已锄了两遍，还上了二百担追肥，并抽出时间打了五天忙工，赚了斗半麦子。在这中间对被侵犯的中农也作了补偿。经过学习向提水，全村群众已明确了向提水的方向，就是生产发家的正确道路。现该村在中贫农的团结生产下，秋苗正在上三锄，并上追肥九千七百八十七担。还抽空打忙工搞副业，已赚洋六十五万余元。
