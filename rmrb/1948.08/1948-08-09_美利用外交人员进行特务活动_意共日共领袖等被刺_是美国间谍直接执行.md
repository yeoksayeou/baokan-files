Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: According to a TASS dispatch from Havana, Cuba, on July 30th, as reported in the Havana "Observador": "The recent assassinations of Italian Communist leader Togliatti, Japanese Communist leader Tokuda Kyuichi, Colombian Liberal Party Chairman Gaitán, and Cuban Communist Party Senator Villy were directly carried out by American spies operating in Latin America and other places." The newspaper stated that many American spies are currently active in Cuba, which is filled with the terror of assassinations.

Another piece of news: According to an article by Hanson Baldwin, the "military writer" for the New York Times, on July 22nd, American espionage personnel are currently exploiting the privileges enjoyed by American embassy diplomatic personnel abroad to conduct intelligence operations. The US government is currently conducting a thorough investigation into the work of American espionage organizations. This investigation was prompted by the recent discovery that the US conspiracy in Eastern Europe to collude with reactionary factions in various countries had failed. One reason for the failure was inaccurate intelligence, which led to misjudgment of the situation. Another was friction between various American espionage organizations.

    美利用外交人员进行特务活动
    意共日共领袖等被刺
    是美国间谍直接执行
    【新华社陕北七日电】据塔斯社七月三十日电引古巴首都哈瓦那“观察报”载称：“最近意共领袖托格里亚蒂、日共领袖德田球一、哥伦比亚自由党主席盖顿、古巴共产党参议员维利的被刺，乃是在拉丁美洲及其他各处活动的美国间谍所直接执行的”。该报称，美国许多间谍现在古巴活动，那里布满着暗杀的恐怖。
    另息：据纽约时报“军事作家”汉森·鲍尔温七月二十二日著文透露，美国间谍人员现正利用美国驻外大使馆外交人员所享有的特权，进行特工活动。美政府现正对美国各间谍组织的工作，进行彻底调查。这次调查，起因于最近美国发现其在东欧勾引各国反动派共同进行的阴谋活动归于失败，失败的原因之一为情报不确以致对形势估计错误，另一为美国各间谍组织间互相磨擦。
