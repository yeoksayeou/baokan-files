[Chahar News] This spring, Beichangfeng and Dongwuligang villages in Wan County loaned 2.5 million yuan (Jicha banknotes, same below) to help 150 peasant households develop sideline production, solving their food shortage difficulties. The loans have been successfully recovered on schedule and are being re-loaned. Beichangfeng village is known for its developed willow weaving industry. With a loan of one million yuan, the village's willow product output increased by one and a half times compared to the past, and the living difficulties of 48 poor and hired peasant households were resolved. The government has now recovered the loans on schedule and continues to lend 500,000 yuan to 36 households as capital for willow weaving. The masses reflected, "We have credit, and the government has even more credit. Without the government's loan support, our lives would be a problem." The masses of Dongwuligang are accustomed to spinning and weaving wicker baskets. This spring, they borrowed 1.5 million yuan to help 107 households form seven basket weaving groups and eight spinning groups. In three months of activity, the difficulties of most of the masses were solved. The loans were recovered on schedule and re-loaned according to actual needs. Except for eight households with real difficulties who temporarily repaid half, the rest have been repaid. The masses unanimously praised the government's loans for playing a role this year.
