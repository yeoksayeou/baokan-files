Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd—The people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Northwest China are living in poverty, with the number of starvation deaths increasing daily, and industrial and commercial firms are constantly closing down. According to a report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on July 21st, since the first half of July in Xi'an, the closure of commercial firms has been heard of every day, even several cases a day; the number of closed cloth shops and ordinary firms has exceeded 20, and four or five banks have put up "for sale" signs. Furthermore, according to a report in the Shanghai "Observer" magazine published on July 17th, as of June 26th, the price of rice in Lanzhou had risen to 25 million yuan per shi (石), and medium-grade flour had risen to 14 million yuan per 100 jin (市斤). The price of gold has broken through 200 million yuan. As a result of the drastic devaluation of enemy currency, "many places are using silver coins as the price representation in transactions." Farmers in most of the barren areas of Gansu Province are trapped in famine, especially in Hexi (west of the Yellow River). Farmers in some places are surviving by collecting wild vegetables, and "people are starving to death every day." In a conversation between an "Observer" magazine reporter and several puppet county heads in Hexi, they openly admitted: "Many expenses have nowhere to come from and have to be placed on the people." As for Ningxia, ruled by the bandit Ma Hongkui, the population is small but bears a heavy burden. The people are suffering from unbearable oppression and exploitation, and "some are even fleeing with their entire families." Generally, those who live on salaries are worried about food and clothing, and no one has the mind to take care of their work. "Everyone is loafing around in the offices."

　　西北国民党统治区
  　人民陷于饥饿绝境
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】西北国民党统治区人民生活困苦，饿死者日多，工商行号也不断倒闭。据七月廿一日沪大公报讯：西安自七月上半月起，商业行号倒闭者日有所闻，甚至一日数起；布行和普通行号倒闭者已超过二十家，银行出顶牌号执照者已有四、五家。又据七月十七日出版的沪“观察”杂志报导：截至六月廿六日，兰州大米每市石已涨至二千五百万元，中等面粉每百市斤已涨至一千四百万元，黄金且突破两亿元。由于敌币猛烈贬值的结果，“许多地方都以银币作为交易时的价格表现了”。甘肃省大部贫瘠地区的农民，陷于饥饿绝境，尤其是河西（黄河以西地区），有些地方的农民正靠采野菜度日，“每天都有饿死的”在“观察”杂志记者和河西几个伪县长的谈话中，他们公开供认：“许多开销没处出，都得放在老百姓身上”。至于马匪鸿逵统治下的宁夏，人口既少，担负繁重，人民因不堪压榨、剥削之苦，“有的甚至举家出逃”。各地一般薪给生活者，则愁吃愁穿，谁也没有心思顾及工作，“大家都在机关里鬼混”。
