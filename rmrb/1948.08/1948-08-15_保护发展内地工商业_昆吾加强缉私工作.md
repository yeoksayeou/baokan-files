　　Protecting and Developing Local Industry and Commerce
  　Kunwu Strengthens Anti-Smuggling Efforts
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] In order to strengthen the economic struggle against the enemy and protect and develop local industry and commerce, the Kunwu Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the bank have decided to strengthen anti-smuggling measures. The county faces the Yellow River, and enemy goods are constantly infiltrating from Henan. Since May of this year, due to some cadres' insufficient understanding of industrial and commercial policies, their inability to adhere to the policy of economic struggle against the enemy, and their failure to research import and export management methods, the number of local smuggling merchants has gradually increased, and the enemy goods market has gradually become openly formed. Cigarettes are the largest category, followed by pigments, and other daily necessities are also numerous. Due to the large-scale infiltration of enemy goods, local industry and commerce have been greatly affected. In Ganlu Collection in the Second District, there were seven machine-made cigarette factories in April, but now there are none. Liu Zhai's dyeing workshop lost 150,000 yuan in three months and has now closed down. A certain cigarette sales office used to sell a large cart of locally produced cigarettes in three days, but now it cannot sell one cart in twenty days. In response to the above situation, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the bank discussed and decided on the following anti-smuggling measures in the future: 1. Open up the minds of cadres, unify steps, and strengthen the economic struggle against the enemy. Use various opportunities to widely publicize our democratic government's policy of protecting and developing local industry and commerce among the masses, expose the enemy's conspiracy of economic plunder, and carry out mass anti-Chiang and anti-American goods movements. 2. Strengthen anti-smuggling work. Each industrial and commercial office at river crossings will add anti-smuggling personnel, and in conjunction with the River Defense Armed Forces Department, organize anti-smuggling groups in villages along the river to form a tight anti-smuggling line. Cadres will personally lead and inspect the blockade of enemy goods from entering the interior. 3. Strengthen investigation and research, regularly grasp the dumping of enemy goods and the situation of local production, and study and improve import and export management methods.

　　保护发展内地工商业
  　昆吾加强缉私工作
    【冀鲁豫电】为加强对敌经济斗争，保护与发展内地工商业，昆吾工商局与银行决定加强缉私办法。该县面临黄河，敌货不断由河南侵入。今年五月以来，由于某些干部对工商政策认识不足，不能坚持对敌经济斗争政策，不研究出入口管理办法，致内地走私商人日渐增多，敌货市场日渐公开形成。其中以纸烟为大宗，其次是颜料，其他日用品亦为数不少。由于敌货大量侵入，内地工商业大受影响。二区甘露集四月份有七个机器卷烟厂，现在一个也没有了。刘砦一家染坊，三个月赔本十五万元，现在也歇了业。某纸烟代售处过去三天出售内地出产纸烟一大车，现在二十天也卖不出一车去。工商局与银行针对上述情况，讨论决定今后缉私办法：一、打通干部思想、统一步调，加强对敌经济斗争。利用各种机会在群众中广泛宣传我民主政府保护与发展内地工商业政策，揭发敌人经济掠夺的阴谋，开展群众性的反蒋美货运动。二、加强缉私工作。各河口工商事务所增添缉私员，并结合河防武装部组织沿河村庄缉私组，构成严密的缉私线。由干部亲自领导，检查封锁敌货内侵。三、加强调查研究，经常掌握敌货倾销与内地生产情况，研究改善出入口管理办法。
