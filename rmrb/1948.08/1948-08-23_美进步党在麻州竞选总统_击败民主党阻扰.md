Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: According to a Reuter dispatch from New York on the 17th, the American Progressive Party has for the first time defeated Democratic obstruction in Massachusetts, securing legal standing for Wallace's presidential campaign. Democratic leaders in the state had attempted to use the law to prevent Wallace from registering as a presidential candidate in the state, as state law requires independent candidates for president to obtain the support of 50,000 voters' signatures to qualify. However, after a surging movement, the Progressive Party obtained 114,000 signatures supporting Wallace. Democratic leaders, embarrassed into anger, requested the election commission to disqualify many of the signatories.

Furthermore, the American Labor Party of New York State, which has the full support of Wallace's Progressive Party, is currently putting forward twenty-six candidates to participate in the state's elections, including the Labor Party's current Progressive Congressman Marcantonio.

　　美进步党在麻州竞选总统
  　击败民主党阻扰
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据电通社纽约十七日讯：美国进步党已在麻萨诸塞州首次击败民主党的阻扰，获得为华莱士竞选总统的合法地位。该州民主党领袖曾企图利用法律来阻止华莱士登记为该州总统候选人，因该州的法律规定：参加总统竞选的独立候选人的竞选资格，需有五万选民签名支持，始得成立。但是在汹涌澎湃的运动之后，进步党竟获得十一万四千人的签名支持华莱士。民主党领袖老羞成怒，竟请求选举委员会取消许多签名者的资格。
    又讯：得到华莱士进步党充分支持的纽约州的美国劳工党，刻正提出二十六位候选人以参加该州竞选，其中包括劳工党的现任的进步众议员马肯多尼奥。
