    Shijiazhuang Cotton Weaving Industry Uses Locally Made Thread
    Costs Reduced, Raw Materials Plentiful

    [Shijiazhuang News] Since the city's Promotion Society convened a meeting of directors from various cooperative textile factories on the 3rd of last month, emphasizing overcoming the mentality of solely relying on foreign thread and promoting the large-scale use of locally made thread, nearly a hundred cotton weaving factories and cooperatives in the city have almost entirely switched to using foreign warp and locally made weft threads. They are also continuously improving technology to maintain and improve quality. The Minxing Cotton Weaving Factory in District One uses foreign warp and locally made weft thread to weave blankets (two weft threads combined into one). Although the finished product is not as soft, fine, and beautiful as those made entirely of foreign thread, it is thick and durable. They are now planning further improvements, reducing the foreign warp thread from three strands per heddle eye to two, and replacing the other strand with locally made thread. Qingji, Laogong, Jianming, Minsheng, and other factories are starting to weave dark-colored striped cloth with foreign warp and locally made weft, for sale in the autumn and winter. The Xinhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the Yumin Flour Mill purchased over a thousand catties of locally made thread from the city's Promotion Society and plan to weave large quantities of white fine cloth, striped cloth, and flour sacks with foreign warp and locally made weft. They also plan to establish a long-term relationship, purchasing three thousand catties of locally made thread monthly for reserve. With the raw material problem completely resolved and costs simultaneously reduced, the factories are even more actively engaged in production.

    The sources of locally made thread are being resolved through the following methods, which have been fully guaranteed. First, the city's Promotion Society is ordering large quantities of locally made thread from various counties in Central Hebei, which will be distributed to the factories for use. Second, organizing and rectifying women's spinning. The joint textile factory of the Third and Fourth Streets in District Three sells cotton to spinning women at low prices and collects the thread to improve the quality of the locally made thread. The Minfeng Cooperative in District Four is increasing wages to stimulate technological improvements. In the past, the cooperative's first-class thread sold for 3,300 yuan per catty on the market; now, it can sell for 4,300 yuan per catty. The governments of the Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Streets in District One have also recently reorganized women's spinning groups to increase the production of locally made thread. Third, because the sales of locally made thread are increasing daily, it is stimulating small merchants to transport large quantities. Recently, ten thousand catties of locally made thread have been transported from areas such as Central Hebei and Southern Hebei.

    石市棉织业使用土线
    成本降低原料充足
    【石家庄讯】自上月三日市推进社召开市内各合作社纺织厂主任会议，强调克服单纯依赖洋线思想，大量使用土线后，近百家棉织工厂及合作社，几已全部改用洋经土纬线，并不断改进技术，保持与提高质量。一区民兴棉织工厂，用洋经土纬织线毯（纬线两根合一根），成品虽不及全用洋线的细软美观，但厚实耐用。现正计划进一步改进，将每个绘眼三根作经的洋线减去一根，用土线代替。庆记、劳功、简明、民生等厂正着手织洋经土纬深色条布，备秋冬出售。新华染织厂及裕民面粉厂自市推进社购至土线千余斤，计划大量织洋经土纬白细布、条布、面袋等。并拟建立长期关系，月购土线三千斤备用。由于原料问题得到完全解决，成本又同时降低，各厂生产更加积极。
    土线来源采用以下办法解决，已获充分保证。一、市推进社赴冀中各县定购大批土线，分给各厂使用。二、组织与整顿妇女纺线。三区三、四街联合纺织工厂，为提高土线质量，工厂低价出售棉花给纺妇，发花收线。四区民丰合作社提高工资刺激改进技术，过去该社头等线在市场出售每斤三千三百元，现每斤可卖四千三百元。一区六、九、十街政府近亦重整妇纺组，增加土线生产。三、由于土线销路日广，刺激小商大批贩运。近来已由冀中、冀南等地运来土线万斤。
