　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS reports: As a result of the unilateral implementation of "currency reform" by the US, British, and French authorities and the issuance of the West German Mark, severe economic difficulties have been created in the western occupied zones of Germany and West Berlin. Moreover, these difficulties are constantly intensifying. In the western occupied zones of Germany, in the first two weeks after the so-called currency reform, shoes and stockings rose by 50 to 100 percent. Non-rationed goods rose by two to five times during the same period, and the purchasing power of the people dropped sharply. Similarly, prices in West Berlin rose by 50 to 100 percent in the eight days from the end of July to August 6th. The number of unemployed workers in the entire West Berlin area reached 120,000 out of 750,000 on the 6th of this month. Furthermore, due to the US and British-manipulated Berlin City Government's passive and negligent attitude towards distributing the 100,000 tons of wheat shipped into West Berlin by the Soviet Union, the people's lives have become even more difficult. Laboring people throughout West Germany have launched widespread protests, strikes, and demonstrations to protest the US and British governments' adoption of such policies that harm the interests of the German people and are irresponsible. In Frankfurt, the center of the Western occupation zone, 50,000 workers held a mass protest rally in the rain. On the 12th, workers in the American-occupied state of Hesse held a twelve-hour strike, with 300,000 workers participating.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS reports: The governments of the United States, Britain, and France in the western occupied zones of Germany are conspiring to implement the so-called "Occupation Statute" to replace the German peace treaty. It is reported that this statute is being prepared at an accelerated pace. The Red Star newspaper, in exposing this conspiracy by the US, British, and French governments, pointed out that the Soviet Union has repeatedly invited the US and British governments to formulate a German peace treaty, but has been stubbornly refused. Because once a peace treaty is signed, the German government has the right to be responsible for handling all issues related to the treaty, and the US, British, and French governments would have to negotiate with this government if they have any requests. However, in the case where the peace treaty is replaced by the "Occupation Statute," the three military governors of the US, Britain, and France, in reality, the United States, can dominate all issues in western Germany. This is why the US, Britain, and France are forcibly implementing the "Occupation Statute" in the western occupied zones, instead of seeking a solution to the peace issue for the entire Germany. In conclusion, the Red Star newspaper pointed out that what the German people need is not a new type of occupation system, but a peace treaty concluded by the four occupying powers with a unified Germany.

　　片面货币改革加深德人民困难
  　西德工人罢工抗议
    美英法图以“占领法规”代替对德和约
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社报导：由于美英法当局片面实行“货币改革”发行西德马克的结果，在德国西部占区及柏林西区，已造成严重的经济困难。而且这种困难正在日益不断的加剧。在德国西部占区，仅在实行所谓货币改革后的头两周内，鞋子及长统袜等即上涨了百分之五十到一百，非配给物品，在同时期内，竟上涨了两倍到五倍，人民购买力亦急剧下降。同样，柏林西的物价，在从七月底到八月六日的八天内就上涨了百分之五十到一百，工人失业者到本月六日在全部柏林西区七十五万人中已达十二万人，再由于美英操纵之柏林市政府对分配运入西部柏林之苏联十万吨小麦采取消极怠工，更加深了人民生活的困难程度。全西德各地劳动人民为抗议美英政府采取此种危害德国人民利益和不负责任的政策，已普遍掀起抗议罢工和示威。在西部占领区统治中心的法兰克福，也有五万工人冒雨举行了群众抗议大会，十二日美占区黑森省职工举行了十二小时的罢工，参加罢工者达三十万人。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社报导：德国西部占领区美英法三国政府正阴谋实施所谓“占领法规”以代替对德和约。据悉，这一法规正在加紧准备中。红星报在揭露美英法政府这一阴谋时指出，苏联曾经再三邀请美英政府制订对德和约，但都遭到了固执的拒绝。因为和约一旦签订，德国政府就有权负责处理和约所涉及的一切问题，而美英法政府有所要求时也就不能不与这个政府进行谈判。但在和约被“占领法规”代替的情形之下，则美英法三个军事总督们实际上也就是美国，就可以主宰西部德国的一切问题。这就是为什么美英法要在西部占区强施“占领法规”，而不要求解决整个德国的和平问题的原因。红星报在结语中指出，德国人民所需要的不是新样式的占领制度，而是由四占领国与统一的德国缔结的和约。
