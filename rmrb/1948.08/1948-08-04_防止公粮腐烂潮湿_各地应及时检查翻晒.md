    Prevent Public Grain from Rotting and Getting Damp
    All Localities Should Promptly Inspect and Sun-Dry
    To the Editor:
    Since the start of summer, there has been a lack of rain. In many places, inspections of stored public grain and materials have not been organized in a timely manner, demonstrating negligence, complacency, and insufficient attention. Recently, it has been raining in various localities, and many houses have collapsed due to the rain. Transferring and sun-drying public grain and materials to prevent losses is a very important matter for all localities at present. Recently, a letter from Shahe County stated: In Fanxiacao Village, District 1 of the county, there was heavy rain on the night of the 16th of this month. Rainwater poured into the house, wetting some of the public grain rice. The house contained approximately 50,000 jin of grain, and the amount of loss is currently being assessed. After this incident occurred, the county government immediately issued instructions for district and village warehouses to conduct rapid inspections and dispatched warehouse cadres to the village to work with village cadres to mobilize the masses to transfer and sun-dry the grain. The incident in Fanxiacao Village should attract the attention of all localities. The occurrence of this event is mainly because we did not choose good houses and did not conduct timely inspections, resulting in unnecessary losses to revolutionary assets. Currently, summer grain is being stockpiled. We hope that all localities will select suitable houses for storage in advance or build warehouses properly and conduct regular inspections to avoid further unnecessary losses.

    防止公粮腐烂潮湿
    各地应及时检查翻晒
    编辑同志：
    入夏雨缺，不少地方对于保管的公粮公物，都未及时组织检查，表现了忽视、麻痹、不够注意。最近各地都已下雨，不少房屋因雨塌坏；转移翻晒公粮公物，不使受到损失，是各地当前很重要的一件事情。最近沙河县来信谈：该县一区樊下曹村，在本月十六日晚上下雨很大，雨水灌入屋内，将公粮的米湿了一部，该房存粮在五万斤左右，损失数目正在清理。此事发生后，县府即发出指示让区村仓库急速进行检查，并派仓库干部前往该村协同村干动员群众转移翻晒。樊下曹这件事应引起各地注意。这事的发生，主要是因为我们选择房子不好，又不及时进行检查，因而使革命资财受到不应有的损失。目前正在囤积夏粮，望各地都能事前选择适宜的房屋存放，或妥建仓库，并时常进行检查，以免再受不应有的损失。
