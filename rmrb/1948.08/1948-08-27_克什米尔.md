　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd Dispatch] Kashmir is one of the largest native states in India, located in northwestern India, bordering China's southwestern Xinjiang. The area is an undetermined boundary between China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. It covers an area of more than 200,000 square kilometers, about two-thirds the size of the North China Liberated Area, with a population of four million, 96 percent of whom are farmers, and 80 percent of the residents are Muslims. Industry is very backward, but it contains rich deposits of coal, oil, bauxite, iron, nickel, gold, etc. From a military point of view, it was once a British military base against the Soviet Union.
　　The people of Kashmir have always suffered from the dual oppression of Britain and its puppet, the Maharaja of Kashmir, living in poverty. The average annual income per person is less than eleven rupees, five times less than the average income of the poorest people in India.
　　The tyrannical rule of Britain and the Maharaja aroused a broad popular democratic movement. As early as 1931 to 1932, the first mass political party appeared in Kashmir—the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference, later renamed the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference. Its first chairman was Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, the current Prime Minister of the provisional government. The party demanded that Britain "get out of Kashmir" and the establishment of a parliamentary government elected by universal suffrage. By 1945, the party organization had unprecedented development, widely establishing many village committees in various places, and organizing workers' groups to carry out peasant movements. The Kashmiri people's movement has since developed vigorously.
　　Before the partition of India, the reactionary authorities in Kashmir brutally suppressed the people's movement, shooting and arresting people everywhere, but ultimately failed to extinguish the raging fire. At this time, the two major parties in India—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—did not support the struggle of the Kashmiri people. Jinnah and his Muslim League instructed their branch in Kashmir to oppose the Kashmiri people's struggle. Nehru and his Congress Party wanted the Kashmir National Conference to adopt a "non-violent" policy, and demanded that the Kashmiri people abandon the slogan of wanting Britain to "get out of Kashmir." After the partition of India on August 15, 1947, Britain decided to turn Kashmir into a battlefield for armed conflict between the two new dominions—India and Pakistan—in order to achieve two goals: first, to use the war situation to suppress the people's movement; second, to make India and Pakistan more dependent on Britain for the sake of waging war. Thus, on December 22, 1947, under British instigation and arrangement, thousands of Pakistani troops invaded Kashmir. The Maharaja of Kashmir and his British "adviser"-controlled government adopted a policy of non-resistance, and the Maharaja and his chief of staff fled.
　　However, British imperialism miscalculated greatly. The people of Kashmir rose up to defend Kashmir and established a provisional government, led by Abdullah, who had been released from prison. The provisional government organized a National Army to carry out a war of self-defense against Pakistan and began to carry out some progressive reforms, such as abolishing the feudal corvée and taxes that weighed heavily on the peasants. The Pakistani invading army was blocked outside the gate of Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, and was driven back to the southwestern mountains.
　　The Indian government participated in the military operations in Kashmir, but the troops it sent were units famous for being anti-Muslim (the majority of Kashmiris are Muslims); on the one hand, it declared its support for Abdullah's democratic government, but on the other hand, it was plotting to restore the Maharaja.
　　Britain is also trying to acquire Kashmir by force through Pakistan. Recently, brigades of Europeans and Americans have appeared in the Pakistani army, including not only British officers but also Americans. US imperialism is also interfering in the strangulation of the Kashmiri people's movement. When India submitted the Kashmir issue to the United Nations for resolution in January of this year, the US representative in the Security Council proposed establishing a so-called "impartial government" in Kashmir to act as an agent for British and American imperialism, canceling the current democratic provisional government. For this purpose, under the manipulation of Britain and the United States, the United Nations also dispatched a five-nation "mediation" Indo-Pakistan Commission (also known as the Kashmir Commission) to India on July 10.
　　In the past month, in the southwestern region of Kashmir, the Kashmiri army has continuously repelled provocations by Pakistani troops. And hundreds of thousands of people are enthusiastically participating in the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference.
　　The Indian newspaper "Naya Sindh" said: "The war in Kashmir is not a war between India and Pakistan, but a war between democracy and reaction."

　　克什米尔
  　国际常识
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】克什米尔是印度几个最大土邦中的一个，位于印度西北部，北邻我国的新疆西南部，该处为中英苏未定界。面积二十多万方公里，约当我华北解放区三分之二，人口四百万，百分之九十六为农民，回教徒占了居民百分之八十。工业很落后，但蕴藏有丰富的煤、石油、铁矾土、铁、镍、黄金等。从军事形势说，它曾是英国反苏的军事基地。
    克什米尔人民，一向受着英国及其傀儡克什米尔大君的双重压迫，生活穷困，每人每年收入平均不足十一个卢比，比世界上最穷困的印度人民平均收入还要少五倍。
    英国和大君的暴虐统治，激起了广大的人民民主运动。远在一九三一年到三二年，克什米尔出现了第一个群众的政党——回教会议党，后来易名为克什米尔国民大会党，其第一任主席就是现在临时政府总理的谟罕默德·阿伯杜拉。该党要求英国“滚出克什米尔去”及成立由普选产生的议会政府。一九四五年时，该党组织有了空前的发展，广泛地在各地建立了许多村委员会，而且组织了工人小组，开展农民运动。克什米尔人民运动从此如火如荼的发展起来。
    印度实行分治以前，克什米尔反动当局曾残酷的镇压人民运动，到处枪杀、逮捕，但终不能扑灭此燎原之火。此时，印度的两大党——国民大会党与回教同盟并没有支持克什米尔人民的斗争，金纳及其回教同盟指示其在克邦的支部反对克什米尔人民的斗争，尼赫鲁及其国大党则要克什米尔国大党采取“非暴力”政策，要克什米尔人民放弃要英国“滚出克什米尔去”的口号。一九四七年八月十五日印度分治以后，英国决定把克什米尔变成两个新自治领——印度斯坦与巴基斯坦武装冲突的战场，借以达到两个目的：第一、利用战争形势把人民运动镇压下去；第二、使印度斯坦和巴基斯坦为着进行战争更加依赖英国。于是，一九四七年十二月二十二日，在英国策动与布置下，数千名巴基斯坦军队侵入了克什米尔，克什米尔大君和他的英国“顾问”控制着的政府采取不抵抗主义，大君和他的参谋长逃走了。
    然而英帝国主义大大地计算错了。克什米尔人民群起保卫克什米尔，并成立了一个临时政府，其领导人是自牢狱出来的阿伯杜拉。临时政府组织了国民军，进行抵抗巴基斯坦的自卫战争，并开始进行一些进步的改革，如废除重压在农民身上的封建性的劳役及赋税。巴基斯坦侵略军被阻于克什米尔首府斯立那加的门外，而且被击退至西南山区。
    印度政府参加了克什米尔的军事行动，但它所派去的军队是以反回教（克什米尔人大多数是回教徒）著名的部队；它一方面宣告赞成阿伯杜拉的民主政府，但另一方面却阴谋着使大君复辟。
    英国还力图通过巴基斯坦以武力取得克什米尔。最近，在巴基斯坦的军队中，已出现欧美人的旅团，其中不但包括英国军官，而且还有美国人。美帝国主义也插手绞杀克什米尔人民运动，当今年一月印度将克什米尔问题提交联合国解决后，安理会中的美国代表曾建议要在克什米尔建立一个所谓“不偏不倚的政府”，以作为英美帝国主义的代理人，取消现在的民主临时政府。为此目的，在英美操纵下，联合国还派遣了一个五国“调处”的印巴委员会（亦称克什米尔委员会）于七月十日到印度。
    最近一月来在克什米尔西南地区，克军又曾不断击退巴基斯坦军队的挑衅。而数十万群众正踊跃参加克什米尔国民大会党。
    印度“纳雅辛纳”报说：“克什米尔的战争，不是印度及巴基斯坦的战争，而是民主与反动之间的战争”。
