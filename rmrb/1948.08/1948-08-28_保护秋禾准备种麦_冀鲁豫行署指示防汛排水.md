JiluYu Telegram: The JiluYu Administrative Office, in order to protect riverbanks, ensure the autumn harvest, and prepare for wheat planting, issued an emergency directive on the 18th of this month, stating: "In recent years, due to enemy destruction, river channels have been neglected, and many low-lying areas have been flooded. Last year, approximately 50,000 hectares were inundated. This autumn, there has been heavy rainfall and rising river levels. The enemy took the opportunity to breach the Wei River, flooding over 23,000 mu of fertile land in Hua and Jun counties. The Jining, Wenshang, Yun, and Si rivers have breached in multiple places. In Wenshang County alone, 230 villages have been affected, with 2,800 hectares of land flooded. In Fan County, Yuncheng, and other counties, there are still some waterlogged low-lying areas without drainage ditches, which have been flooded. To prevent flooding, our governments at all levels have achieved great success in water management work in the first half of this year, dredging 21 rivers, including the TuHai, MaJia, Xiao, ZhuLong, and JinXian rivers, and digging 365 drainage ditches, thus preventing flooding in the vast majority of low-lying areas. However, due to insufficient understanding of rainfall, water conditions, terrain, and other factors in various places, many waterlogged low-lying areas have not been drained, and many damaged embankments have not been repaired. This year, the risk of flooding remains high. Therefore, the following suggestions are made: (1) At this time of continuous rain and rising river levels, close attention must be paid to riverbank breaches, especially the Wei River and the South Grand Canal, which are in danger of flooding at any time due to damaged embankments. Each special district and county along the river should, based on changes in the riverbank and water conditions, organize the masses in villages along the river to protect the embankments and prevent dangers in sections. If breaches are discovered, they should immediately be organized to block them, build embankments, and control the water flow. Also, according to the water flow, dig ditches to divert water into the river to prepare for wheat planting. If it is an area bordering the enemy or a guerrilla zone, local armed forces should provide cover or other methods should be used to complete water management and protect the people's production. (2) Survey the flooded low-lying areas immediately, mobilize the masses to dig ditches to drain the water, protect autumn crops, and prepare for wheat planting. When draining water in low-lying areas, persuade and educate the masses that the interests of water should be subordinate to the greater interests, and overcome localism and departmentalism among some cadres and the masses. If digging ditches damages land, priority should be given to replenishing it during the winter land allocation and adjustment. Compensation should be provided for damaged crops based on actual yield to prevent a portion of the masses from losing land or suffering losses due to river digging."

JiluYu Telegram: Fan County and Yanggu County in the Ninth District dredged the JinXian River, preventing flooding of thousands of hectares of fertile land. The JinXian River originates at the junction of Pu, Fan, and Guan counties, flows northeast through Guancheng, Nanfeng, Yanggu, and Xin counties, and enters the TuHai River. It is over 100 li long. Due to years of neglect, it has caused waterlogging. Last autumn, it flooded 1,500 hectares of crops, causing famine in the second and eighth districts of Yanggu and the fourth district of Nanfeng. This spring, Yanggu and Nanfeng successively dug 18 drainage ditches and vigorously dredged the river channel, and thousands of hectares of fertile land have been spared from flooding.

　　保护秋禾准备种麦
  　冀鲁豫行署指示防汛排水
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫行署为防护河堤，确保秋禾，准备种麦，特于本月十八日发出紧急指示，内称：近年来由于敌人破坏，河道失修，许多洼地积水成灾。去年淹地约五万顷。今年秋季多雨，河水上涨，敌人乘机在卫河扒口，淹我滑、浚两县良田二万三千余亩，济宁、汶上运、泗两河，已有多处决口，汶上一县被灾二三○村，淹地二八○○顷、范县、郓城等县还有些积水洼地，未挖排水沟，而被水淹。为防除水患，今年上半年我各级政府的治水工作，曾获得了很大成绩，疏浚了徒骇、马颊、硝河、潴龙、金线等二十一条河，挖排水沟三百六十五条，因之绝大部分洼地避免了水淹。但由于对各地雨量、水势、地形等情况了解不够，仍有许多洼地积水没有排除，许多残破堤岸没有修好，今年水患仍有很大危险。为此特提出以下意见：（一）当此阴雨连绵水涨河发之际，要高度注意河堤决口泛滥，特别是卫河、南运河，因堤岸残缺，随时有泛滥危险，沿河各专县应根据堤岸水势变化，随时组织沿河村庄群众，分段护堤防险，发现冲决堤岸应立即组织抢堵、筑埝、束水。并根据水流情况，挖沟引水入河，准备种麦，若系接敌区游击区，应以地方武装掩护或以其他方法完成治水，保护群众生产。（二）被淹洼地立即勘察，并动员群众挖沟排水，保护秋禾，准备种麦。在洼地放水应说服教育群众，水利益服从大利益，克服部分干部与群众中的地方性和本位思想。如挖沟毁地，要在冬季抽补调剂土地时尽先补给。挖毁庄稼可根据实际产量，设法赔偿，免使一部分群众因挖河而失掉土地，或受到损失。
    【冀鲁豫电】九分区范县、阳谷等县疏通金线河，千顷良田避免水淹。金线河发源于濮、范、观三县交界处，东北流经观城、南峰、阳谷、莘县入徒骇河，长百余里，因年久失修，积水成灾，去年秋季淹没庄稼一千五百顷，造成阳谷二、八区及南峰四区等处的灾荒。今春阳谷、南峰先后挖开排水沟十八条，并大力疏通河道，千顷良田已免除水患。
