　　【This newspaper's dispatch】North China General Branch reporter's comprehensive report: The news of the convocation of the North China Provisional People's Congress quickly spread throughout the vast cities and villages of the North China Liberated Area. After mid-July, from the mountainous areas of Chahar in the north to the plains of Hebei, Shandong and Henan in the south, millions of people excitedly plunged into democratic elections, which were fully completed by the end of the month. A total of 595 representatives were elected, including 298 regional representatives, 93 representatives of social figures, 35 representatives of workers and staff, 30 representatives of chambers of commerce, 50 representatives of women, 35 representatives of the People's Liberation Army, 15 representatives of the cultural circles, and 7 representatives of the Hui people. Among them were local peasant leaders, labor heroes, outstanding workers, technical experts, as well as industrialists, businessmen, enlightened gentry, and advanced figures in the cultural circles. All regions and occupational groups elected representatives they trusted to jointly discuss the construction plans of the North China Liberated Area. This election fully demonstrated the spirit of close unity between people of all strata in the Liberated Area and between the Communist Party members and people of all strata. Not only were many Communist Party members honorably elected as representatives, but many Communist Party members also helped non-Party members get elected as representatives through their own modesty. Shi Yuanpei, chairman of the Xinji City Federation of Industry and Commerce and a Communist Party member, was a candidate for the city's industrial and commercial representatives, but he helped Chen Jinyu, a member of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, to run for election, eventually enabling him to win. Li Ziying, a Communist Party member and primary school teacher in Guancheng County, voluntarily resigned after being elected as a representative in order to unite non-Party members, and re-elected Principal Gong Qingbin.
    Although the elections in various places were conducted during the tense period of production and support for the front, they were still extremely solemn. In Shulu, Zhao County, Shen County, Luancheng and other counties in central Hebei, and Guancheng, Zhuxian (Liaocheng) and other counties in Hebei, Shandong and Henan, extended village cadre meetings were held in each village before the election to discuss the significance and methods of this election. They went to the masses to publicize and deliberate, and then held the district people's representative meetings to conduct preliminary elections. The representatives elected in the preliminary elections in each district gathered in the county to conduct competitive elections, and then conducted formal elections. Mr. Cao Bacui, a representative of social figures in Zhao County, was formerly a landlord. He said during the election: "I have followed Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for eight years. I have already broken with the landlord class and am determined to fight to the end against American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. If I am elected, I will definitely contribute all my strength!"
    The elections of industrial and commercial representatives in Shijiazhuang, Yangquan, Handan, Linqing, Botou, Jincheng and other cities were even more enthusiastic. Industrialists and businessmen all believed that the unification of the North China Liberated Area would greatly promote the development of industry and commerce. In Shijiazhuang, 3,934 seated merchants from more than 70 trades actively participated in the election in the continuous heavy rain, and elected Liu Hongda, Feng Yunzhang, Jia Xingwu, Zhang Shouxin, Zhao Ming, Zhao Huaxuan and other six people. The workers and staff elected Tian Yunhua, an old worker who had been working for 23 years, and Li Liang, deputy director and chief engineer of the Railway Bureau, as representatives. Li began working in the railway in 1929 and is one of the three major bridge experts in China today. In Linqing City, special personnel were selected by all sectors to form an election committee to be responsible for the election, and a grand celebration meeting was held on July 14. Botou City's method was: each industry was divided into groups, and one preliminary election representative was produced for every ten households, and then three official representatives from the city were elected. During the formal election on July 21, many merchants and residents voluntarily wrote celebratory slogans, the venue was decorated with tall colorful arches, and visitors flocked in an endless stream, as happy as a festival. The representatives took their seats and conducted a secret ballot. As a result of the first ballot, Mr. Wang Fangru, director of the Commercial Federation, and Mr. Liu Chaosheng, representative of the oil industry, were elected. The votes obtained by Mr. Zhang Quanli, a member of the Commercial Federation, and Mr. Zhang Rongqing, a representative of the cloth industry, were equal. After another round of competitive elections, the votes were recounted, and Mr. Zhang Quanli won nineteen more votes than Mr. Zhang Rongqing and was elected as an official representative. More than a dozen students who had just come to North China University from Beijing and Tianjin witnessed all this and happily said: "We have seen true democracy for the first time." In Taiyue Jincheng, 721 seated merchants conducted elections in nine streets, and a total of twelve candidates were nominated. Finally, Zhang Guanglin, manager of the Yihou Street Mass Cooperative, was honorably elected. In Yangquan City, each private furnace produced one representative. During the election, it was raining heavily, and mountain torrents were raging, but the furnace owners scattered in villages dozens of miles away waded through knee-deep torrents and enthusiastically came to participate in the election. They said: "We can't miss this opportunity. We must elect our representatives and go to the meeting to discuss a good way to make the iron furnaces develop faster!"
    The Hui people were extremely satisfied with the separate elections. In Weixian, Linqing and other seven counties in southern Hebei, representatives were elected by the Hui villages, together with the imams and elders (managers) of the mosques in the counties. As a result, He Qikuan, the imam of the Weixian Mosque, was elected. Zheng Hanxuan, chairman of the Linqing Hui People's Association, said: "In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, it was very difficult for the Hui people to be elected, no matter what representatives were elected. Now the Hui people can elect their own representatives separately, which truly guarantees the rights of ethnic minorities."
    Representatives from various places are now collecting opinions and preparing proposals. After the county representatives were elected, all the students of the county normal school organized a Yangko dance team to conduct extensive publicity at the market fair. When the representatives of the six administrative offices of Hebei, Shandong and Henan arrived in Liaocheng, representatives of various agencies and organizations and citizens gathered in the streets to greet them. Commissioner Tao Dongdai personally presented flowers to the representatives, and there was a burst of joy and thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. Xiao Shangfan Gao Shicai also spoke on behalf of the citizens, warmly congratulating the representatives of various counties.

　　参加临时人代会共商建设大计
  　华北人民隆重选举代表
    选出各阶层暨少数民族代表五百余人
    【本报讯】华北总分社记者综合报导：召开华北临时人民代表大会的消息，迅速传遍华北解放区广大的城镇与乡村。七月中旬以后，北自察哈尔山地，南至冀鲁豫平原，千百万人民兴奋地投入民主选举，至月底已全部完成。共选出代表五百九十五人，计区域代表二百九十八人，社会贤达代表九十三人，职工代表三十五人，商会代表三十人，妇女代表五十人，解放军代表三十五人，文化界代表十五人，回民代表七人。其中有各地农民领袖，劳动英雄，有优秀的工人，技术专家，也有工商业家，开明绅士，文化界先进。各地区各职业团体都选出了自己所信任的代表共同负责商讨华北解放区的建设大计。此次选举充分表现出解放区各阶层人民之间，共产党人与各阶层人民之间亲密团结的精神。不仅有许多共产党员光荣当选为代表，而且有许多共产党员，以自己的谦让去帮助非党人士当选为代表。辛集市工商联合会主席共产党员史元培，系该市工商业代表候选人，但他却帮工商联合会委员陈进雨先生竞选，终使其获胜。观城县小学教员共产党员李子英当选为代表后，为了团结非党人士，又自动辞退，改选了校长弓庆宾先生。
    各地选举虽系在紧张的生产、支前中进行，但仍极隆重。冀中束鹿、赵县、深县、栾城等县，冀鲁豫观城、筑先（聊城）等县，选举前各村均召开了村干扩大会，讨论此次选举的意义和办法。分别到群众中宣传、酝酿，然后开区人民代表会举行预选，各区预选当选的代表，集合到县展开竞选，再进行正式选举。赵县社会贤达代表曹拔萃先生，从前系一经营地主，他在竞选时说：“我跟着毛主席共产党走了八年，我已经和地主阶级分裂，并决心和美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石斗争到底，如果选上我，我一定贡献出我所有的力量！”
    石家庄、阳泉、邯郸、临清、泊头、晋城等市工商业代表的选举，情况更为热烈。工商业家咸信全华北解放区的统一，将大大促进工商业的发展。石家庄七十几行三千九百三十四家座商，在连日大雨中踊跃参加选举，选出刘鸿达、冯云章、贾星五、张守信、赵铭、赵化轩等六人。职工则选出当了廿三年的老工人田蕴华和铁路局副局长兼总工程师黎亮为代表。黎氏一九二九年即参加铁路工作，为当今中国工程界三大桥梁专家之一。临清市由各界推选专人成立了选委会，负责办理选举，并在七月十四日举行了盛大的庆祝大会。泊头市的办法是：各行业划分小组，每十家产生预选代表一人，再选出全市正式代表三人。七月廿一日正式选举时，许多商民自动刷写庆祝的标语，会场扎着高大的彩牌，参观者络绎不绝，欢快犹如节日，代表对号入座，进行不记名投票。第一次投票结果，商联会主任王芳如、油业代表刘朝相两先生当选，商联会委员张全立与布行代表张荣庆两先生所得之票数相等，经过再度展开竞选，重新投票，结果张全立先生比张荣庆先生多十九票，当选为正式代表。甫自平津来华北大学就学的学生十余人，目睹了这一切，都喜悦地说：“我们第一次看到真正的民主了。”太岳晋城七百二十一家座商分九街进行选举，共提出十二个候选人，最后驿后街群众合作社经理张广林光荣当选。阳泉市私营各炉产生代表一人，选举时正在大雨之后，山洪暴涨，但是分散在数十里外各村的炉主，都涉过膝深的急流，踊跃赶来参加选举。并说：“这机会可不能错过，选出咱们的代表，到会上去讨论个好办法，使铁炉更加发展得快！”
    回民对单独选举极表满意。冀南威县、临清等七县，均由回民村选出代表，与各县清真寺教长、乡老（管事人）等一齐进行选举。结果威县清真寺教长何其宽等当选。临清回民公会会长郑翰轩说：“过去国民党统治时期，无论选什么代表，回民都很难选上，现在回民能单独选自己的代表，就真正保障了少数民族的权利。”
    现各地代表正搜集意见，准备提案。县城代表选出后，县师全体学生组织了秧歌队，在集市庙会上作扩大宣传。冀鲁豫六专署各县代表抵达聊城时，各机关团体代表及市民群集街头，夹道迎送。陶东岱专员亲向代表献花，一时欢乐雷动，经久不息。小商贩高世才并代表市民讲话，向各县代表热烈致贺。
