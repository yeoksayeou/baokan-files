　　Implementing the Spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference
    Wu'an Coal Industry Reviews Deviations
  　Initially Determines Methods for Improving Business Management
    [Taihang Telegraph] In order to implement the resolutions of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the Wu'an County Trade Union convened a coal industry symposium on July 27, attended by more than 80 people including managers, trade union representatives, and kiln masters from various factories. At the meeting, the past management methods were deeply reviewed, and preliminary improvement methods were determined. The county's coal industry is one of the important local industries, supplying not only the county but also being sold in Handan, Yongnian, Guangping, Shahe, Xingtai and other places. The county is divided into four mining areas, with more than 70 large and small coal kilns (not including the coal kilns directly under the Industrial Bureau of the Border Region Government). There are more than 5,000 workers. The meeting first reviewed the existing problems in the past. First, the erroneous "poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoint" penetrated into the factories. For example, the Yonghe Village coal kiln in the second district earned more than 1.6 million yuan last year, but as a result of extinguishing fires and selling coal, and "taking care" of poor peasants and hired laborers with excessively high wages, it lost 20,000 yuan every day; the baskets made by the villagers themselves were of poor quality and expensive, and the kiln was forced to use them. In some kilns, the "poor peasant groups" that were organized did not obey the kiln master's guidance, and the trade union cadres did not dare to manage them, which seriously undermined production and management. Second, excessively high wage policies. In the fourth district's coal kilns, the highest wage was 25 jin of millet per person per day, one basket of coal, and pocket money, and the factories rarely made a profit. Secondly, the unreasonable egalitarian wage system dampened the enthusiasm of technical workers for production. Workers, regardless of age, experience, or skill level, received the same wages, especially in public factories, which did not adopt a policy of uniting and transforming technical workers. For example, the Limin Coal Mine adopted simple methods of struggle and expulsion against some of the old technicians' old ideas and work styles; the Xiaolimin Coal Kiln in Nanshan also had the same situation, so many workers went on strike, and technicians did not dare to offer suggestions, which affected the improvement of workers' skills and reduced production. The Xiaodonggou Coal Kiln, which used to produce 400 baskets of coal per day, was shut down because of this erroneous practice. If it is reopened, it will require more than 1 million yuan of capital. Third, business management was unplanned, without rules, and extravagant and wasteful. For example, in a certain public coal mine, there were only 30 workers but 32 staff members. The manager was not only unprofessional but also acted blindly and subjectively. When opening the public Shumei Coal Kiln, no prior research was done, wasting a lot of money and failing to produce coal, so that workers' wages could not be paid. Secondly, there were disputes related to sectarianism and kiln boundaries. For example, the Limin Coal Kiln and the Xinhua Coal Kiln did not pump water due to technical sectarianism, which seriously affected production. In Shangxia Muniudi and Shuiquanhe in the third district, work was stopped due to disputes over kiln boundaries, causing all three kilns to be flooded, resulting in losses of no less than 100,000 yuan. After suffering such great losses, the people who managed the factory did not think that this was a mistake, and they did not check afterwards, without any sense of responsibility or economic discipline, reaching such a serious mistake. After such a review, it was unanimously believed that if this phenomenon was not overcome, it would be a fatal strangulation of coal production. After the review, group meetings were held to combine discussions to further understand the importance of developing and building industry, and to determine the long-term construction policy for the future, overcoming egalitarian viewpoints and the blind actions of those who were uneducated. A reasonable wage system should be implemented, based on the level of labor skill and production results, and decisions should be made on the basis of wage increases or decreases from time to time. Kiln boundaries should be based on 1,000 square meters, and the trade union should draw maps to explain, and then go to the government to obtain mining permits. Larger coal mines should establish a management committee of five to nine people, with the manager as the main person, and technicians, trade union cadres, and worker representatives participating to jointly develop production under the leadership of the manager. A technical research association should be formed with the coal mine as a unit to unite and give play to the role of old technicians, improve technology, increase production, democratically formulate labor discipline, resolutely prohibit the phenomenon of strikes; strengthen worker education, stimulate their enthusiasm for production, implement necessary streamlining, establish necessary systems, and overcome all chaotic phenomena.

　　贯彻华北工商会议精神
    武安煤业检讨偏向
  　初步定出改善经营管理方法
    【太行电】为贯彻华北工商会议决议，武安县工会于七月二十七日召开煤业座谈会，参加各厂经理、工会代表、窑师等八十余人。会上深刻检查过去的经营管理方法，初步定出改善办法。该县煤业是当地重要工业之一，除供给本县外，尚销行于邯郸、永年、广平、沙河、邢台等地。全县分四个矿区，有大小煤窑七十多座（直属于边府工业厅的煤窑未计在内）。工人五千余人。会议首将过去存在的问题进行了检讨。第一、错误的“贫雇观点”钻在工厂里来。如二区永和村中煤窑去年赚了一百六十余万元，但由于灭火卖煤及以过高工资“照顾”贫雇的结果，每天赔两万；该村群众自制的篓，质量坏，价钱又贵，强制窑上用。有的窑上组织的“贫农团”，不服从窑师指导，工会干部也不敢管，严重的破坏了生产与管理经营。第二，过高的工资政策。四区煤窑最高工资每天每人小米廿五斤、一筐煤、还有零花费，厂方很少获得利润。其次是不合理的平均主义的工资制，打击了技术工人生产积极性。工人不分老幼新旧、技术高低，同样工资，特别是公营工厂，对技术工人不是团结改造的方针。如利民煤矿对老技师的某些旧的思想作风采用简单的斗争与开除的办法；南山之小利民煤窑亦有同样情况，因而不少工人怠工，技师也不敢提，影响工人技术的提高，使生产量缩减。日产四百筐煤有小东沟煤窑，即因这种错误的作法而停了工。如重新开采，还需要一百多万元的资本。第三、经营管理没计划，没制度，铺张浪费。如××公营煤矿，工人只有三十个，职员却有卅二个。经理不仅业务，主观盲干。开采公家树煤窑时，事先没研究，浪费了很多钱，没开出煤来，以致工人工资无法解决。其次，存在有关宗派及窑界等纠纷。如利民煤窑与新华煤窑因技术宗派不抽水，严重影响生产。三区上下木牛地和水泉河，因闹窑界纠纷而怠工，使三座窑全部水淹，损失不下十万万。遭受这样大的损失，而管理工厂的人，也不觉得这是错误，事后亦不检查，没有责任的、没有经济纪律，达到如此严重错误。经过这样检查后，一致认为这种现象如不加以克服，即是对煤业生产致命的绞杀。检讨后，即进行小组大会结合讨论，进一步认识了发展与建设工业的重要，确定了今后长期建设的方针，克服平均主义观点与不学无术的盲干作法。实行合理的工资制，以劳动技术熟练程度生产效果为标准，依时作出决定工资增减的依据。窑界以一千平方公尺为标准，通过工会画图说明，再到政府领矿证，较大煤矿要成立五至九人的管理委员会，即以经理为主、技师、工会干部、工人代表参加，在经理领导下共谋生产之发展。并以煤矿为单位组成技术研究会，团结发挥老技师的作用，提高技术，增加生产，民主制订劳动纪律，坚决禁止怠工现象；加强工人教育，启发其生产积极性，实行必要精简，建立必要制度，克服一切混乱现象。
