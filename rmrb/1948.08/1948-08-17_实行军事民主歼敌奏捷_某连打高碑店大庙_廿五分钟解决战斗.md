　　【Pingbao Frontline News】In the Pingbao Campaign, the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, when capturing the Great Temple stronghold south of Gaobeidian, promoted military democracy and resolved the entire battle in twenty-five minutes. After receiving this task, the company's cadres first conducted a preliminary investigation of the enemy's strength, types of troops, and fortifications, learning that the enemy had a company of soldiers, two machine guns, four sentry towers around the Great Temple, a layer of gun emplacements, and a ditch one and a half zhang deep and wide. They also personally examined the terrain, understanding that the northeast side of the temple was open ground, and the west side had a large reed marsh. After discussion, the unanimous opinion was to突(burst) towards the enemy along the reed marsh. They also told the soldiers about the enemy situation, terrain, and the divisions of labor for each platoon, so that everyone could offer ideas. Regarding the selection of assault routes, the soldiers of a certain platoon suggested a frontal assault, which could bypass the reed pit. Another platoon proposed assaulting down the slope beside the reed pit to avoid casualties. As long as they broke through the open ground of just over one zhang, they could approach the enemy. Everyone thought this idea was good and agreed with it. In terms of the organization of firepower, everyone also put forward specific opinions. Regarding the destruction of enemy fortifications, everyone suggested using landmine blasts. When discussing action tactics, soldier Liu Shumei of a certain squad suggested: "Use more landmines, and take advantage of the smoke and fire rising upwards after the explosion to avoid losses." Wang Jinnian said: "After breaking through the forward edge, send fewer people in first, throw a few grenades at them, and shout for them to surrender. If the enemy wants to surrender, only send one squad to collect the weapons. The other squads should still be on guard against the enemy at the station." After entering the battle, as soon as the artillery opened fire and the bugle sounded, the soldiers突 (charged) upwards like dragons and tigers. When the third artillery shell hit, they had already突 (charged) to the edge of the Great Ditch. Upon reaching the edge of the Great Ditch, they discovered a barbed wire fence in front of them, which had not been investigated beforehand, and they did not have the tools to break the barbed wire; however, the comrades did not panic. A certain platoon leader immediately gave a mobile order: set up the machine guns for cover, and he was the first to crawl through. The other soldiers also followed suit and quickly resolved the enemy. It only took five minutes from the start of the assault to occupy the forward edge. And the entire battle was completed in twenty-five minutes.

　　实行军事民主歼敌奏捷
  　某连打高碑店大庙
  　廿五分钟解决战斗
    【平保前线讯】解放军某部八连，于此次平保战役中攻克高碑店南大庙据点时，发扬军事民主，二十五分钟全部解决战斗。该连接受是项任务后，连里干部先对敌人的兵力、兵种、工事作了初步调查，了解了敌人有一连兵力，两挺机枪，大庙周围有四个岗楼，一层枪眼，大沟深宽各一丈五。又亲自看了地形，了解了庙里的东北面是开阔地，西面有一块大苇塘。经过讨论，一致意见是顺着苇塘向敌人突。并把敌情、地形和各排的分工，告诉战士，让大家出主意。对选择突击道路，某排战士们提出了正面突，可把苇坑绕过去。某排提出顺着苇坑边的坡下突，可免伤亡。只要突过一丈多的开阔地，就可接近敌人。大伙认为这个意见好，都同意了。在火力的组织方面，大家也提出了具体意见。关于摧毁敌人的工事，大家提出使用地雷爆破。在讨论动作问题时，某班战士刘树梅提出：“多用几个地雷，爆破后趁烟火往上冲，可避免损失。”王进年说：“突破前缘后，可少进去几个人，先打他几个手榴弹，先喊话，敌人要缴枪，只进去一班收枪就行，别的班还应该防备车站上的敌人。”在进入战斗后，炮兵一开射，冲锋号一响，战士们象生龙活虎似的往上突，等打到第三炮时，已突到大沟边上。一到大沟边，发现前面有一道铁丝网，因事先没调查出来，也没带着破铁丝网的用具；可是同志们并没有发慌，某排长马上机动的命令：把机枪架好掩护，他首先钻过去，别的战士也相继跟着过去，迅速的解决了敌人。从冲锋开始到占领前缘仅用了五分钟。而全部结束战斗，共用了二十五分钟。
