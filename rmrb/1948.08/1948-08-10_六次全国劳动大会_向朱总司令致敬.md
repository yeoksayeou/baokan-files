Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 6th: The Sixth National Labor Congress's Message of Respect to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Generals of all War Zones, and all Generals and Commanders and Fighters across the Country:

    The Sixth National Labor Congress solemnly opened in Harbin on the great anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, "August 1st." The Congress hereby extends its respects to you on behalf of the nation's workers!

    In the history of the Chinese revolution, the monumental achievements already established by the People's Liberation Army are immeasurable. In particular, since the People's Liberation War began in July 1946 to resist the attacks of the American imperialist lackey, the Kuomintang reactionaries, after victoriously crushing the Kuomintang bandit army's all-out invasion in the first year of combat, the war entered a large-scale offensive in the second year. Vast lands and vast populations have been successively liberated from the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The recent stunning victories on the Central Plains, Jinzhong, North China, and East China battlefields, the successive capture alive of bandits such as Qu Shouren, Zhao Chengshou, and Kang Ze, and the continuous capture of heavily fortified cities such as Kaifeng, Yanzhou, and Xiangyang, further prove that the strength of the People's Liberation Army has become so powerful that it is invincible and indestructible. Therefore, the final end of the Kuomintang reactionary rule is getting closer and closer. All this is the result of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and generals at all levels' wise command, as well as the correct execution of Chairman Mao's strategic policies and the high degree of heroism displayed by the people's army. The Congress will further mobilize the nation's workers to fully support the revolutionary war until the final victory.

          Respectfully, the Sixth National Labor Congress, August 1st

    六次全国劳动大会
    向朱总司令致敬
    【新华社东北六日电】第六次全国劳动大会致朱总司令及各战区将领及全国将领与全体指战员同志：
    第六次全国劳动大会于中国人民解放军诞生的“八一”伟大纪念日在哈尔滨隆重开幕。大会谨代表全国职工向你们致敬！
    在中国的革命历史上，人民解放军所已创立的丰功伟绩，是无法计量的，尤其是从一九四六年七月为了抵抗美国帝国主义走狗国民党反动派的进攻而开始的人民解放战争，在第一年的作战中胜利地粉碎了国民党匪军的倾巢进犯之后，到战争的第二年就转入了大规模的进攻，广大的土地，广大的人民，陆续从国民党反动派的血腥统治下解放出来。最近中原、晋中、华北、华东各大战场上的惊人大捷，区寿年、赵承绶、康泽等匪首先后被活捉，开封、兖州、襄阳等强固设防城市不断被攻克，进一步证明了人民解放军的力量，已经强大到无敌不破，无坚不摧。因此，国民党反动统治的最后结束之期，已经愈来愈近了。这都是朱总司令和各级将领英明指挥以及全体将士正确地执行了毛主席的战略方针与各项政策，并高度发挥了人民军队英雄主义之结果。大会一定进一步动员全国职工，以全力支援革命战争，直到最后胜利。
          第六次全国劳动大会谨上  八月一日
