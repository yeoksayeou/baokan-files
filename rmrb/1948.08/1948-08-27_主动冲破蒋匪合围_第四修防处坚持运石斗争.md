(Jilu Yu Telegram) According to a report from the Fourth Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River: The stone transport struggle at Wangkou Mountain has begun again. Before July, our Wangkou Mountain Stone Quarry was subjected to four encirclements and attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Security Second Brigade, and the stone transport work was temporarily forced to stop. In order to completely prevent our stone transport work, Chiang Kai-shek specifically stationed about a thousand people, including the Security Second Brigade and the puppet Pingyin Brigade, Dong'a Brigade, and Feicheng Brigade, in Wangpo Village, more than ten miles northeast of Wangkou Mountain, preparing to invade at any time. Because the flood season is approaching, all dangerous works need to prepare materials to meet emergency needs. More than two thousand cubic meters of stone are still stockpiled on the riverbank of Wangkou Mountain awaiting transport. Our Fourth Repair and Defense Office decided to make a second effort to rush the transport of stone. The transportation started on July 27. Because our side had the experience of the first stone transport struggle, we strived to be proactive everywhere. The daily opening time, number of times, and number of boats were uncertain, making it impossible for the enemy to grasp our pattern. At the same time, we strengthened reconnaissance work, stopping when the enemy came and transporting when the enemy left. By using this method, we persisted until the morning of the 31st without being disturbed by the enemy bandits. On the afternoon of the 31st, the enemy ambushed in Liuhequan, but we detected it, so we stopped the transport. The enemy robbed more than a thousand catties of wheat in the village and captured a farmer, returning disappointed. On August 1, more than 40 people from the puppet Pingyin Brigade fired at us in Wangjiadian (less than a mile from Wangkou Mountain). At 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd, the enemy Security Second Brigade, in cooperation with more than a thousand people from the puppet Pingyin, Feicheng, and Dong'a Brigades, all moved out in three routes to encircle our stone quarry. Our unit met them head-on with gunfire, and the enemy scurried back with their heads in their hands. Our employees took the opportunity to steer the boats to the north bank of the Yellow River. When the enemy's large troops came up, we were nowhere to be seen. On the morning of the 7th, more than 600 enemies came to encircle again, but because we were not transporting stone at that time, we did not suffer any losses. Under these extremely difficult conditions, we rushed to transport 716 cubic meters of stone by the 7th. In order to complete the task of rushing to transport two thousand cubic meters of stone, we are still persisting in rushing the transport.

　　主动冲破蒋匪合围
  　第四修防处坚持运石斗争
    【冀鲁豫电】据黄河第四修防处报导：望口山的运石斗争又开始了。我望口山石厂在七月以前，遭受蒋匪保安二旅四次围攻合击，运石工作暂时被迫停止。蒋匪为了彻底阻止我方运石工作，特以保安二旅及伪平阴大队、东阿大队、肥城大队等约千余人，长期驻于望口山东北十余里之王坡村一带，准备随时出犯。因为大汛期临，各险工都需准备工料，以应急需，望口山河边还积存石料二千余方待运，我第四修防处乃决定做第二次抢运石料的努力。运输于七月二十七日开始。由于我方有了第一次运石斗争的经验，处处争取主动，每天的开运时间、次数、船数都不一定，使敌人摸不到我们的规律。同时并加强了侦察工作，敌来即停、敌去则运。以此方法坚持到三十一日上午，未遭敌匪扰害。三十一日下午，敌人设伏于刘河圈，被我查觉，我即停运，敌在该村抢了千余斤麦子，并抓去一个农民，败兴而返。八月一日伪平阴大队四十余人，又在王家店（距望口山一里许）向我射击。二日上午八时，敌保二旅配合伪平阴、肥城、东阿等大队千余人全部出动，分三路向我石厂包围，被我×部迎头射击，敌抱头回窜，我员工乘机拨船到河北岸，敌大队上来时，已不见我之踪影。七号上午，敌六百余又来合围，因是时我未运石，未遭损失。在此种极端困难的条件下，至七日止，我抢运七百十六方石。为了完成抢运二千方石的任务，仍在坚持抢运中。
