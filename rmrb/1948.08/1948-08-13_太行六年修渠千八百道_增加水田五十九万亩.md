(Taihang Electricity) Over the past few years, the democratic governments at all levels in the Taihang area have led and carried out water conservancy construction, bringing great benefits to the people of Taihang who suffer from drought nine years out of ten. From 1942 to June 1948, a total of 1,833 new and restored irrigation and drainage canals were built, 2,823 new wells were dug, and 1,641 old wells were repaired. A total of more than 590,000 mu of new and restored paddy fields were added. And 50,000 mu of fertile land was spared from flooding. During the severe droughts in the Taihang area in 1942, 1943 and 1944, the democratic government made every effort to lead the masses to fight against the drought, and carried out a widespread campaign throughout the area to build canals, build water storage ponds, dig water cellars, sink water wells, and divert water from the mountains. Seventeen counties including Shahe, Xingtai, Zanhuang, Lincheng, Neiqiu, Pingdong (east of Pingding), Jingxing, Wu'an, Shexian, Licheng, Zuoquan, and Linxian newly built 118 large and small irrigation canals that could irrigate more than 55,000 mu. Among them, the Zhanghe South Canal in Shexian and the North and South Canals along the banks of the Zhuozhang River in Licheng are the largest, and can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land. After some areas were occupied by Japanese bandits and the Kuomintang army, the original canals could not be repaired and became silted up and caused disasters. Once liberated, the democratic government immediately took the initiative to lead the masses to dredge them. The canals that have been restored successively include the Minzhu Canal in Anyang and the Minyou Canal in Cixian, the Jianggou Canal in Bo'ai, and parts of the canals in Xingtai and Shahe counties, which can irrigate more than 20,000 mu of land in total. During the famine last year, the masses in the Taihang area once again launched a large-scale canal construction and well-digging campaign. Twenty-two counties newly built and repaired 1,682 small canals, and newly opened and repaired 3,470 water wells, turning 168,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, with an average increase of four dou of coarse grain per mu, which can increase grain production by more than 670,000 shi, greatly strengthening the masses' ability to overcome famine. The Taihang Fourth Administrative Region River Management Committee specially formulated a river management and embankment restoration plan in September last year. Under the leadership of the democratic government, the masses in the four counties (Wenxian, Qinyang, Bo'ai, and Wuzhi) of the administrative region, after three months of active efforts this spring, have restored the East and West Xiaohong, Wuchekou, and Dafankou embankments that were destroyed by the Kuomintang army Zhang Jingzhong's troops and the 97th Army in the 28th and 29th years of the Republic of China, and dredged the Guangji River, which had been blocked by the traitor Li Duanzhang for ten years.

　　太行六年修渠千八百道
  　增加水田五十九万亩
    【太行电】太行区各级民主政府数年来领导开展水利建设，使十年九旱的太行人民得到莫大的福利。自一九四二年至一九四八年六月，共新修与恢复水旱渠一千八百三十三道，新凿水井二千八百廿三眼，修旧水井一千六百四十一眼。共新增与恢复水田五十九万余亩。并使五万亩良田免于水患。一九四二、四三及四四年太行区严重旱灾，民主政府曾全力领导群众与旱灾作斗争，在全区普遍开展修渠、造积水池、挖水窖、凿水井及开山引水运动。沙河、邢台、赞皇、临城、内邱、平东（平定以东）、井陉、武安、涉县、黎城、左权、林县等十七个县新修了能灌溉五万五千余亩的大小水旱渠一百一十八条。其中以涉县漳河南渠和黎城浊漳河两岸南北两渠为最大，可浇一万亩以上土地。有些地区被日寇和国民党军占领后，原有渠道不能修理，淤积成灾。一经解放，民主政府即积极领导群众疏浚，先后恢复的水渠计有安阳的民主渠及磁县民有渠、博爱蒋沟及邢台、沙河两县部分渠道，共可浇地两万余亩。去年灾荒时，太行区群众又一次展开了大规模的修渠凿井运动。有二十二个县新筑与修复小渠一千六百八十二条，新开和修补水井三千四百七十眼，使十六万八千亩旱地变为水田，平均每亩增产四斗粗粮，计可增产粮六十七万多石，大大加强了群众的渡荒能力。太行四专区治河委员会在去年九月专门订出治河复堤计划，在民主政府领导下，该专区四个县（温县、沁阳、博爱、武陟）的群众经今年春天三个月的积极努力，已将国民党军张敬忠部及九十七军在民国二十八年、二十九年破坏的东西小虹、五车口、大樊口等堤修复，并把汉奸李端章筑埝断水十年的广济河疏通。
