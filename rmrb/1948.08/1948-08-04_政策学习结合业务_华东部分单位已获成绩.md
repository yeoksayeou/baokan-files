    Policy Study Combined with Work
    Achievements Already Made in Some Units in East China
    [Xinhua News Agency East China Dispatch] Party, government, and military cadres in various parts of East China are launching a study movement on current events, policies, and discipline. The movement began before the two major festivals of "July 1st" and "July 7th," and was further widely mobilized during the two festivals. At the Hua Dong Military Region's directly subordinate organs' commemorative meeting, Zhang Yunyi, Deputy Commander of the East China Military Region, and Shu Tong, Director of the Political Department, both gave reports, emphasizing that the unity of strict revolutionary discipline and the Party's policies is of paramount importance for winning the victory in the Liberation War. At the Bo Hai District's directly subordinate organs' commemorative meeting, Comrade Peng Kang, Director of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau, emphatically explained that a state of indiscipline seriously exists within the Party in the Bo Hai District, and called on everyone to unite and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's line and policies. In addition, Lu Zhong and other places also made study mobilizations. The CPC Central China Working Committee also issued instructions, calling for widespread propaganda and education of policies among cadres and the masses in coordination with the current struggle against the enemy and production tasks.
    After widespread study mobilization, various localities have concretely organized study and formulated study plans. The Jiaodong District Party Committee decided to strengthen the leadership of study in the district and establish planned, organized, and step-by-step study. The directly subordinate organs of the District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office established a unified study leading organization. In the study, first review the study attitude, improve the initiative and awareness of study, and establish the regularity of study. The content and steps of the study focus on current affairs, policies, and discipline education, and combine with business study according to the different situations of each unit. At the beginning, focus on studying Chapter 2 of "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" and the preface to the reprinting of this chapter by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to overcome the state of anarchy and indiscipline that exists to varying degrees in various departments. Then, study various study documents and various specific policies of the Party in stages. Basic policies such as land reform and party rectification must be studied by any department and any cadre. Other policies, such as industrial and commercial, financial, and cultural and educational policies, can be selected for study according to the needs of each department. In the study, attention must be paid to the combination of theory and practice, concretely check the implementation of policies, expose wrong ideas, and immediately correct errors. Cadres from the East China Finance and Economics Office and the Shandong Provincial Government organs had already begun studying, but it was interrupted due to helping with wheat harvesting. Now, in order to cooperate with the grain requisition work, it has been decided to first study this year's grain requisition methods, and then enter the study of industrial and commercial policies.
    After the start of study in various places, some units have achieved preliminary results. Cadres from various directly subordinate organs in Jiaodong District have begun to attach importance to the study of theory and policies, and have successively taken out surplus allowances to purchase and read Comrade Mao Zedong's works, read various documents of the Party stipulated by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and combine this with conducting mass work in resident villages. In the study, the Qixia County Party Committee in Jiaodong District summarized the previous stage of production and disaster relief work, reviewed the deviations in the propaganda and implementation of the Party's policies, and decided to continue to strengthen policy study in combination with actual work. After studying Comrade Ren Bishi's report, cadres in the Fourth District of Cangshan County (newly established county) in Lunan said: "In the past, we were not clear about which were landlord and rich peasant components, and we didn't know that uniting the middle peasants was so important; the last time I was asked to go to the village to review the mistakes of infringing on the middle peasants, I couldn't get through my thinking, and I wouldn't go no matter what, but this time I understand."

    政策学习结合业务
    华东部分单位已获成绩
    【新华社华东电】华东各地党政军干部正展开关于时事，政策和纪律的学习运动。运动于“七一”、“七七”两大节日之前即已开始，而在两个节日中更作了广泛的动员。华方军区直属机关纪念大会上，华东军区副司令员张云逸、政治部主任舒同均先后作了报告，强调指出：严格的革命纪律与党的政策的统一，对取得解放战争的胜利具有头等重要意义。渤海区直属机关纪念会上，华东局宣传部长彭康同志着重说明目前渤海区的党内严重存在着无纪律状态，号召大家团结与统一起来，坚决贯彻毛主席和党中央的路线和政策。此外鲁中等地也分别作了学习动员。中共华中工委亦发出指示，号召配合当前对敌斗争生产任务，在干部与群众中广泛进行政策的宣传教育。
    经过广泛学习动员之后，各地均纷纷具体组织学习，制定学习计划。胶东区党委决定加强本区的学习领导，建立有计划、有组织、有步骤的学习。区党委、军区和行署直属机关建立了统一的学习领导组织。学习中，首先检讨学习态度，提高学习的自动性自觉性，建立学习的经常性。学习的内容和步骤，以时事、政策、纪律教育为主，根据各单位不同情况，结合进行业务学习。开始无着重学习“左派幼稚病”第二章及中宣部重印此章的前言，以克服各部门中或多或少存在着的无政府、无纪律状态。然后分阶段学习各项学习文件，及党的各种具体政策。土改、整党等基本政策，任何部门、任何干部都必须学习，其他政策如工商、财政、文教政策等，可按各部门工作需要选择学习。学习中必须注意理论与实际结合，具体检查政策执行情形，揭发错误思想，并即时改正错误。华东财经办事处及山东省政府机关干部原已开始学习，因帮助麦收而中断，现因须配合征粮工作，决定先学习今年征粮办法，再进入工商业政策学习。
    各地学习开始后，部分单位已获初步成果。胶东区各直属机关干部已开始重视理论与政策学习，纷纷拿出节余津贴购阅毛泽东同志的著作，阅读中共中央宣传部规定的党的各种文献，并结合进行驻村群众工作。胶东栖霞县委在学习中总结了前一阶段生产救灾工作，检讨了宣传与执行党的政策上的偏差，决定继续结合实际工作加强政策学习。鲁南苍山县（新设县）四区干部在学习任弼时同志的报告后，干部说：“咱过去弄不清哪些是地主、富农成份，更不知道团结中农这样重要；前次叫我去村里检讨侵犯中农的错误，我就打不通思想，无论如何不去，这回才明白了。”
