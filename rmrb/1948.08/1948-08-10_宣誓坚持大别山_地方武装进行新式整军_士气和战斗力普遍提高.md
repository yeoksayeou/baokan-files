    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 7th. The local armed forces of the Dabie Mountains People's Liberation Army have achieved remarkable results in carrying out the new-style rectification campaign. After a month to four months of rectification, the morale of a certain unit of the Hubei-Henan Military Region has generally improved, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates has also improved significantly. In several battles, the 7th company of this unit defeated the attacks of hundreds of local Kuomintang troops with only one squad. The soldiers chased the routed enemy, fighting fiercely and rushing forward, showing boundless bravery, and each time they had spoils of war. Before the rectification, there were quite common phenomena in the troops such as not paying attention to mass discipline, cadres having warlord tendencies, and subordinates being dissatisfied with superiors. After this rectification, not only was the troops unprecedentedly united, but also mass discipline was improved. The troops universally launched a movement to do good deeds for the masses. Every time they arrived in a place, they filled the wood stacks and the water vats. All military and political work did not require cadres to mobilize, and the soldiers automatically launched competitions. Everyone had a plan, vowed to persist in the Dabie Mountains, strive for progress, and resolutely serve the people. In mid-April, the company had eight days of eating without oil or salt, but the soldiers were still in high spirits, maintained a strong fighting spirit, and no one complained.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 7th. A company of more than 70 local Kuomintang troops under Wang Weizhe, entrenched in ＠Makou (belonging to Hanchuan County), west of Wuhan, led by Company Commander Wang Jishou on the 15th of last month, surrendered to a certain unit of our Jianghan Military Region with more than 40 rifles.

    地方武装进行新式整军
    士气和战斗力普遍提高
    【新华社中原七日电】大别山解放军各部地方武装进行新式整军成绩卓著。鄂豫军区某部经一月至四月的整军后，士气普遍提高，上下级关系也有显著改善。该部第七连在几次作战中，仅以一个班的兵力就击溃了数百土著国民党军的进攻。战士们追击溃敌，猛打猛冲，表现了无现的英勇，且每次均有缴获。整军前部队中存在着颇为普遍的不注意群众纪律、干部有军阀主义倾向、下级不满上级等现象。经此次整军后，不仅部队空前团结，群众纪律亦提高。部队普遍展开替群众办好事运动，每到一地总是柴满垛、水满缸。一切军政工作不须干部动员，战士们即自动展开竞赛。每个人都订有计划，宣誓坚持大别山，力求进步，坚决为人民服务。该连在四月中旬曾有八天吃饭无油无盐，但战士们依然情绪极高，保持旺盛的战斗精神，无一人说怪话。
