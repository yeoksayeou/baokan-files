　　According to the Spirit of the Industry and Commerce Conference
  　Factory 301 Improves Management
　　[Shijiazhuang News] In accordance with the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the state-owned Factory 301 in Shijiazhuang is streamlining its organization, simplifying procedures, and researching methods to improve its business management in order to further corporatize. On July 10th, the factory convened a meeting of cadres above the section chief level to study and discuss the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference. Three groups were formed for production management, business management, and administrative management, respectively, to read documents and inspect work. After more than ten days of discussion, preliminary opinions were put forward. On the 21st, these were discussed by the expanded factory committee, and the original organizational structure and interim regulations were revised. The important measures include: (1) Merging the original Technology Office and Engineering Section into the Engineering Section, and the Secretariat and Personnel Section into the Secretariat, with the Business Section remaining the same. This resulted in significant streamlining of personnel. The Engineering Section and Technology Office previously had a total of 21 people, but now 14 people can handle the work that was previously done. (2) The Materials Warehouse of the Engineering Section was changed to the Materials Storehouse, under the leadership of the Business Section. The Business Section can directly hand over purchased materials and goods to the warehouse for inspection. In the past, any material requisition required the signature of the head of the Engineering Section. Now, the head of the Business Section stamps the requisition for important production materials, technicians stamp the requisition for general production materials, and the respective sections are responsible for requisitioning non-production materials. (3) The Engineering Section assigns technicians to each production department to assist the foremen in their work. The foremen and technicians are fully responsible for technical guidance and material allocation within their respective areas, resolving general problems, with major problems being resolved by the section chief. This saves time and eliminates many troubles. (4) The Business Section was originally divided into two groups. It is now divided into three groups: Accounting, Procurement and Transportation, and Sales. Separating the past procurement and sales into two groups makes the division of labor clearer and saves manpower. An preliminary budget and final accounts system for branch factories has been established in accounting. The Sales Group has established a daily journal and ledger, and cash is settled daily. (5) With regard to expenditure, it is stipulated that any expenditure beyond the budget must be approved by the factory director. Based on the above decisions, the Third Department of the factory has established a system for estimating labor and materials, and recording labor and materials. In the future, for relatively large projects, labor and materials will be estimated together with the craftsmen in advance (important projects must have drawings prepared by the Engineering Section as the basis). A repair and manufacturing ticket system is adopted. All jobs that need repair, except for particularly urgent ones, must be ticketed according to the size and complexity of the project, and the tickets must be signed by the head of the Engineering Section or the foreman before they can take effect. The repair and manufacturing ticket includes the project name, purpose, quantity, start date, completion date, and materials consumed. The ticket is issued by the foreman to each production team, and after completion, it is returned to the foreman by the team leader. The clerks assist in the statistics, and at the end of the month, the figures for labor and materials used by each department can be obtained. This allows for constant inspection and verification to see if there is any waste. For small repairs lasting less than two hours, tickets are issued in advance, and recorded in the odd-job ledger. This also facilitates comprehensive assessment, so that odd jobs are not overlooked as they were in the past. The above measures have been implemented. However, the repair ticket lacks items such as estimated labor and materials and quality requirements, and needs further improvement.

　　根据工商会议精神
  　三○一厂改善管理
    【石家庄讯】石市公营三○一厂根据华北工商会议的精神，精简机构，简化手续，研究改善经营管理的方法，以便进一步企业化。该厂于七月十日召开科长以上干部会议，研究讨论华北工商会议的精神，组成生产管理、经营管理、行政管理等三个小组，分别阅读文件，检查工作。经过十多天讨论，提出初步意见。二十一日经扩大厂委会讨论，将原有组织机构及暂行规程加以修改。其重要措施包括：（一）将原来的技术室与工程科合并为工程科，秘书室与人事科合并为秘书室，经营科依旧。人员因之大有精简，工程科与技术室过去共二十一人，现在十四人即可办了过去的事情。（二）将工程科之材料库改为物料库，归经营科领导。经营科买回材料物品可直接交库验收。过去领取任何材料均须工程科长签字，现在重要生产材料经营科长盖章领取，一般生产材料由技术员盖章领取，非生产材料则径由各科负责领取。（三）各生产部门由工程科派技术员帮助工长工作，工长及技术员对所属范围内的技术指导、工料分配负全责，解决一般问题，重大问题始由科长解决。这样既省时间，也省去许多麻烦。（四）经营科原分两股，现设会计、采运、营业三股，将过去的采购与营业分成两股，分工较前明确，也省人力，在会计上建立了分厂预决算制度。营业股建立了日记帐，分类帐，每日交结现金。（五）经费开支，规定预算以外者必经厂长批准。根据上列各种决定，该厂第三部已建立估工估料，记工记料制度。今后比较大的工程，事前和工匠们一道估出工料（重要的工程，并须工程科绘制图样作准）。采用修理制作票，所有需要修理的活计，除特别紧急者外，须根据工程大小繁简，分别制票，由工程科长或工长签字方能生效。修制票内容包括工程名称、用途数量、动工时日、完工时日、消耗材料等项，票由工长向各生产班发出，完成后由班长交回工长，工务员协助统计，月终即可得出各部所用工料数字。这样随时可以检查，核算是否有浪费现象。两小时以下的零碎修理，事先开票，做完登记在零活帐上，这样也便于全面的考核，不致象过去那样作了零活没人见。以上办法，已经实行。惟此项修整票没有预计工料、质量要求等项，尚须进一步改善。
