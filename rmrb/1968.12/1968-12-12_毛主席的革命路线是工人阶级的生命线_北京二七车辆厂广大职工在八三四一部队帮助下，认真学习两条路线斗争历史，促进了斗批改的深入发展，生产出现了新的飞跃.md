The revolutionary workers of Beijing's No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, cherish deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. With the help of the support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit of the People's Liberation Army, they have closely linked theory with practice, launched a vigorous campaign to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, further raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and deepened the struggle, criticism, and reform. Production has leaped to new heights. In November, the factory's production level surpassed its historical peak, and some products have completed the annual state production plan ahead of schedule and in excess.

Through the tempering and testing of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of Beijing's No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory have significantly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. After the support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit entered the factory, they emphasized the propaganda and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, firmly grasped the class struggle without letting up, fully mobilized the masses, and carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism. They exposed a handful of class enemies within the factory who were sabotaging and disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, greatly promoting the struggle, criticism, and reform throughout the factory.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be constantly and repeatedly propagated. It is not enough to propagate it to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The revolutionary workers of No. 27 Factory, after studying this latest instruction from Chairman Mao, quickly launched a campaign to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, with the help of the support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit. Currently, from workshops and departments to teams, from family areas to single-person dormitories, more than a hundred Mao Zedong Thought study classes of various types have been established, with the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines as the central content. Many revolutionary workers who live outside the factory have voluntarily organized themselves to study on the trains during their commutes.

In the course of the study, the revolutionary workers throughout the factory have extensively carried out the "one expose, two investigate, three criticize" activities.

"The one expose" is to thoroughly expose the history of the struggle between the two lines in this factory. Revolutionary workers have carefully studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, studied Chairman Mao's other important works, and studied Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have linked this with reality, thoroughly exposed the history and current state of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in this factory, further clarified what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and what is the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. This has further raised everyone's awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The workers say: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of our working class. We will fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while we live, and we will die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. "The two investigate" is to thoroughly investigate the harm caused by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in this factory, exposing their crimes of advocating "the theory of the extinction of class struggle," "expert management," "material incentives," and "bonus as the key" in broad daylight, making everyone more clearly recognize their evil deeds and the harm of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line to the revolutionary cause. "The three criticize" is to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top walk-capitalist-roaders within the Party, eliminate their poison, and deepen the struggle, criticism, and reform. Since the launch of the campaign to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, a new wave of revolutionary criticism has swept through this factory, with every revolutionary worker taking to the stage, each pen wielding a sword, and the more they criticize, the more they hate Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and the more they love Chairman Mao. The Northern Branch Factory's transportation, machinery repair, and frame workshops, through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines and the carrying out of revolutionary criticism, have seen a new change in people's spiritual outlook, and there has been a new upsurge in revolution and production.

In the course of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines and carrying out the "one expose, two investigate, three criticize" activities, the amateur investigation teams, with old workers as the main body, have gone deep into various workshops and departments, vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, propagated Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, investigated the situation of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in various workshops, and together with the broad revolutionary workers, fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, pushing the various tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, such as the cleaning of class ranks, to a deeper level.

Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary workers of No. 27 Factory have further raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. With deep proletarian feelings of eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they have displayed boundless wisdom, carried out extensive technological innovation and technological revolution, launched a fierce attack on the "old and difficult" problems, and at the same time carried out extensive cooperation, with sky-high enthusiasm, they have thrown themselves into the high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production.

    毛主席的革命路线是工人阶级的生命线
    北京二七车辆厂广大职工在八三四一部队帮助下，认真学习两条路线斗争历史，促进了斗批改的深入发展，生产出现了新的飞跃
    据新华社十一日讯　具有光荣革命传统的北京二七机车车辆工厂广大革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，在人民解放军八三四一部队驻厂支左人员的帮助下，紧密结合实际，掀起了轰轰烈烈的两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，斗、批、改正在深入发展，生产出现了新的飞跃。十一月份全厂生产水平超过了历史最高纪录，部分产品提前超额完成了全年国家生产计划。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，北京二七机车车辆工厂广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟得到很大提高。八三四一部队支左人员进厂以后，突出宣传和落实毛主席一系列最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，充分发动群众，深入地开展革命大批判，揪出了厂内破坏和干扰毛主席伟大战略部署的一小撮阶级敌人，大大地推动了全厂的斗、批、改。
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”二七厂的广大革命职工学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，在八三四一部队支左人员帮助下，迅速掀起了党内两条路线斗争史的学习运动。目前，全厂从车间、科室到班组，从家属区到职工单身宿舍，已经办起了一百多个以学习两条路线斗争史为中心内容的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，许多在厂外住宿的革命职工自动组织起来，上下班途中在列车上进行学习。
    在学习中，全厂革命职工广泛地开展了“一摆、二查、三批”活动。
  “一摆”是大摆本厂的两条路线斗争史。革命职工认真学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，学习毛主席的其他重要著作，学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，联系实际，大摆本厂阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的历史和现状，进一步认清了什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，从而进一步提高了大家执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。职工们说：毛主席的革命路线就是我们工人阶级的生命线。我们生要为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死要为毛主席的革命路线而献身。“二查”是深查刘少奇及其代理人推行反革命修正主义路线在本厂所造成的恶果，把他们鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等黑货的罪状都拿到光天化日之下，使大家更清楚地认识到他们的罪恶和反革命修正主义路线对革命事业的危害。“三批”是狠批刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义思想，肃清其流毒，深入开展斗、批、改。从两条路线斗争史的学习运动展开以来，这个厂革命大批判的新高潮一浪高过一浪，广大革命职工个个上阵，人人口诛笔伐，大家越批对刘少奇及其代理人越恨，对毛主席越热爱。北分厂运输、修机和车架等车间通过两条路线斗争史的学习和开展革命大批判，人的精神面貌发生了新的变化，革命和生产有了新的起色。
    在学习两条路线斗争史，开展“一摆、二查、三批”活动中，以老工人为主体的业余调查组，深入到各车间和科室，大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，调查各车间阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的情况，同广大革命职工一道，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，把清理阶级队伍等斗、批、改的各项工作推向深入。
    二七厂的广大革命职工通过学习两条路线斗争史，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，他们怀着永远忠于毛主席革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，发挥无穷的聪明才智，大搞技术革新和技术革命，猛攻“老大难”的问题，同时大搞协作，以冲天的干劲投入了抓革命促生产的高潮。
