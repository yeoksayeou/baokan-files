"Arid Has" and "Lush Has" — these are the names of the same place in two different eras, with stark contrasts.

In the era of people's rule, especially in recent years with the vigorous revolutionary movement, the vast mountainous region of Has in northeastern Albania has undergone tremendous changes.

When we visited this place, the members of the agricultural cooperatives were busy with autumn harvest and planting in the hills and fields. Our Albanian comrades, pointing to the bountiful crops and orchards before us, excitedly and proudly said, "Thanks to the development of water conservancy, vast tracts of land have been irrigated, and this year's grain, vegetables, and fruits have all been bountiful."

As the people of Has say, one cannot truly understand the changes of today without knowing the past of Has.

"Arid Has"

Has is a mountainous region with a population of eight thousand. During the long years before Albania's liberation, the swift Drin River flowed through this region year-round, but because the riverbed was too low, people could only watch the water flow from east to west into the Adriatic Sea, while the crops received no irrigation. In summer, the scorching sun baked the land of Has into a parched expanse; in winter, heavy rains would cause water to flow everywhere. Due to the prolonged lack of water for much of the year, the people who had lived in Has for generations called this barren, shrub-covered place "Arid Has."

Before Albania's liberation, there was virtually no agriculture here. The people living in this mountainous region could only make a living by cutting firewood, making charcoal, and raising a few livestock. To obtain a bit of salt, people often had to climb mountains and cross valleys, walking over a hundred kilometers to the city of Shkodër in northern Albania to buy it. The brutal exploitation and oppression of the feudal lords and rich peasants were like a heavy mountain pressing down on the people of Has. At that time, when people met, they would first ask each other, "Do you have bread to eat?" The suffering people of Has, like the oppressed people in other regions, endured the torments of natural disasters and man-made calamities before liberation, living in extreme poverty. They yearned for food, and even more for freedom and liberation!

A New Beginning

In 1945, the Albanian National Liberation Army, led personally by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, liberated the Kukës region. From then on, the light of the Party of Labor shone over this region, and the remote, backward Has began its new life.

In 1952, the first batch of agricultural cooperatives was established here in the Kukës region. To change the backward appearance of this place and develop grain production, the Party of Labor called on the people of Has to engage in a tenacious struggle with nature. At that time, former feudal lords, rich peasants, and other hostile elements spread rumors and engaged in sabotage among the masses. However, the people of Has exposed and smashed these hostile elements' various plots. Under the guidance of the Party, they launched an attack on the barren mountains. They made a resolute vow: "The Party gives the people new life, and the people must transform the mountains!" In the early days of cooperativization, the people of Has, with their labor and sweat, built a 125-kilometer-long irrigation canal and dug several small reservoirs to collect rainwater, thus irrigating over 200 hectares of land. Since then, the work of developing water conservancy has never stopped.

The Battle Against Aridity

Two years ago, Comrade Enver Hoxha emphasized at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania: "The only path for socialist construction in rural areas is the collectivization of agriculture. Apart from collectivization, any other path can only lead to the development or restoration of capitalism in rural areas." After the Fifth Congress, the farmers in this region who had not yet joined cooperatives actively responded to the Party's call, immediately organized themselves, and joined the cooperatives. They said, "Now we are even more tightly united, and we will definitely use collective strength to conquer the arid land." At the same time, through the Party and government's extensive political and ideological work among the masses, the idea that Has could not achieve self-sufficiency in grain was gradually changed, further mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm and making their revolutionary spirit even more ardent. Under the inspiring slogan of the Party of Labor to make the hills and mountains as fertile as the plains, the people of Has, in addition to continuing to dig many irrigation canals and small reservoirs, have so far built eight reservoirs. The ninth reservoir, the Rakova Reservoir with an irrigation capacity of 700 hectares — one of the largest water conservancy projects in the country — is currently under construction. On the construction site, excavators and tractor trucks roar, presenting a bustling scene of labor.

A Victory Song

Mustaqe Imeri, the construction team leader currently building the reservoir, told us: In response to the Party of Labor's call for industry to support agriculture and cities to support the countryside, in the early spring of 1967, 50 workers from the Durres Construction Machinery Company brought excavators, tractors, and other machinery here. They set up temporary shelters at the foot of the mountain where wild boars often appear, worked in two shifts day and night on the construction site, and began the battle to build this reservoir. During the construction process, the workers and technical personnel encountered many difficulties. First, the muddy clay in the rainy season made it difficult for the tractors to pull the excavated soil. However, they did not yield to the difficulties; if one tractor was not enough, they used two tractors to pull. In the summer, the dry climate often caused the machines to overheat quickly, damaging the parts. At this time, they thought of ways to repair the machines and finally overcame one difficulty after another. According to the original plan, the reservoir was to be completed next year. However, the entire construction team decided: "Ensure completion by the end of this year so that the reservoir can irrigate crops next year." Mustaqe Imeri also told us: During the construction, the entire team constantly used the following battle slogans to inspire themselves: "Every cubic meter of soil excavated is several kilograms of grain produced!" "Completing one year ahead of schedule is contributing several thousand tons of grain to the motherland!" Therefore, the entire construction team has been completing the work quota with excellent results every day, and has now excavated over 560,000 cubic meters of soil.

With their tenacious labor of fighting against nature, the people have made "Arid Has" a thing of the past; today's Has has become "Lush Has." The eight agricultural cooperatives and one state farm in Has now have over 2,000 hectares of cultivated land, with irrigated land accounting for about half of the total cultivated area. In the past, when the people of Has met, they would ask each other if there was bread to eat. Now, the grain produced in the Has region not only meets the needs of the local residents but also has surplus grain to sell to the state. For example, the "Three Martyrs" Agricultural Cooperative, which could barely maintain three months of food for the community five years ago, can now ensure self-sufficiency in grain and has sold surplus grain of 200 hundredweights to the state this year.

Singing the New Life

In the past, the people of Has had recorded the poverty and aridity of the Has region in their folk songs and expressed their strong desire to change the appearance of the mountains. Today, under the wise leadership of the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, their wishes have become a reality. The people of Has have composed new songs, singing the praises of the Party and their great leader, singing the praises of the beautiful new socialist life. In the courtyard of the eight-year school in the village of Krumë, we listened with the entire school's teachers and students to a new song of Has performed by young folk singers. They sang passionately:

The land of Has, the mountains of Has,
Arid Has has been neglected for a thousand years.
Since the dear mother, the Party of Labor, came,
She brought us boundless wisdom.
The rugged mountains have become granaries,
Arid Has has changed its appearance....

### 哈斯新歌

专栏：阿尔巴尼亚通讯

    哈斯新歌
      “干旱的哈斯”和“茵绿的哈斯”——这是同一个地方在两个不同时代的两个迥然不同的名称。
    在人民政权年代里，在近年来轰轰烈烈开展的革命化运动中，阿尔巴尼亚东北部库克斯区的这片广阔的山区发生了天翻地覆的变化。
    我们来到这里访问的时候，农业合作社社员们正在山坡间和田野上进行紧张的秋收和秋种。陪同我们的阿尔巴尼亚同志指着眼前一片丰收的庄稼和果树林，兴奋而自豪地说：“由于兴修水利，大片土地得到灌溉，今年的粮食、蔬菜和水果都获得了好收成。”
    正如哈斯的山民们所说，不了解哈斯的过去，就不能更好地了解今天的变化。
      “干旱的哈斯”
    哈斯是一个有八千人口的山区。在阿尔巴尼亚解放前的漫长岁月里，湍急的德林河虽然终年不停地流经这一地区，但是由于河床太低，人们只能眼看着河水由东向西流入亚得里亚海，而庄稼却得不到灌溉。夏季，烈日曝晒，哈斯的土地一片干旱；到了冬天，遇有大雨时，雨水又满山遍野流散。由于一年中较长时间十分缺水，世世代代居住在哈斯的人民就把这块灌木丛生的荒凉地方称作“干旱的哈斯”。
    阿尔巴尼亚解放前，这里基本上没有农业，居住在这个山区的人民只能依靠砍柴、烧炭和饲养一些牲畜过活。为了吃到一点食盐，人们常常不得不爬山越岭，步行一百多公里，到阿尔巴尼亚北部的斯库台城去买。封建主和富农的残酷剥削和压迫，就象压在哈斯人民头上的一座大山。那时，人们见面，首先是互相关心地问着：“有面包吃吗？”苦难的哈斯人民同其它地区被压迫的人民一样，解放前受到天灾人祸的折磨，生活十分贫困。他们渴望粮食，更渴望自由和解放！新生的开始
    一九四五年，由阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志亲自领导的阿尔巴尼亚民族解放军解放了库克斯区，从此，劳动党的光辉普照了这个地区，穷乡僻壤的哈斯开始了它的新生。
    一九五二年，在这里建立了库克斯区第一批农业合作社。为了改变这块地方的落后面貌，发展粮食生产，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党号召哈斯人民同大自然进行顽强搏斗。这时，过去的封建主、富农等敌对分子在群众中散布谣言，进行破坏活动。但是，哈斯人民揭露和粉碎了这些敌对分子的种种阴谋。他们在劳动党的教导下，向荒山展开了进攻。他们发出了铿锵的誓言：“党使人民获得新生，人民一定要改造山区！”在合作化最初的年代里，哈斯人民用自己的劳动和汗水修成了一百二十五公里长的水渠，挖掘了一些小型的蓄水池，积聚雨水，从而使二百多公顷的土地得到了灌溉。此后，兴修水利的工作从未间断。
      向干旱开战
    两年以前，霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上强调指出：“农村社会主义建设的唯一道路是农业的集体化。除了集体化，任何别的道路只能导致在农村中发展或恢复资本主义。”五大以后，这个地区尚未合作化的农民，积极响应党的号召，立即组织起来，加入了合作社。他们说：“这下我们更紧密地拧在一起了，我们一定用集体的力量征服干旱的土地。”同时，由于党和政府在群众中大力展开政治思想工作，逐步改变了一些人认为哈斯不可能实现粮食自给等想法，这样就进一步调动了群众的积极性，使他们的革命斗志更加高昂。在劳动党发出的使丘陵和山区变得象平原那样富饶的口号的鼓舞下，哈斯的山民除继续挖掘了许多水渠和小型蓄水池外，到目前为止，已经修建成了八个水库。第九座灌溉能力为七百公顷的拉克伐水库——全国最大的水利工程之一，现在正在加紧修建中。在工地上，掘土机和载运土方的拖拉机隆隆作响，呈现一片热气腾腾的劳动景象。
      战斗的凯歌
    正在这里修建水库的施工队长穆斯塔法·伊梅里同志向我们介绍说：为了响应劳动党关于工业支援农业、城市支援乡村的号召，一九六七年的初春，都拉斯建筑机械使用公司的五十名工人，开了掘土机、拖拉机和带上其它各种机械来到这里。他们在野猪经常出没的山脚下搭起了临时工棚，分两班昼夜不停地奋战在工地上，开始了兴修这座水库的战斗。在施工过程中，工人们和技术人员曾经遇到过很大的困难，首先是雨季里泥泞的粘土使拖拉机拖不动被挖掘的土方。但是他们没有在困难面前低头，一台拖拉机不行，就用两台拖拉机来拖。在夏季，干燥的气候又经常使机器很快发热，使零件受到损坏，这时他们就想方设法维修机器，终于战胜了一个又一个的困难。根据原定计划，这座水库要到明年才能完工。但是施工队全体同志决定：“保证在今年年底完工，以便使水库明年就可以灌溉庄稼。”穆斯塔法·伊梅里同志还告诉我们：在施工中，全队同志时刻用这样的战斗口号鼓舞自己：“多挖一立方土，就是多生产几公斤粮食！”“提前一年完工，就是多向祖国贡献几千吨粮食！”因此，整个施工队每天都以优异的成绩超额完成工作定额，现在已经挖掘了土方五十六万多立方米。
    人们用战天斗地的顽强劳动，已经使“干旱的哈斯”成为历史上的名词；今天的哈斯，已成了“茵绿的哈斯”。哈斯的八个农业合作社和一个国营农场已经拥有两千多公顷耕地，水浇地的面积已占全部耕地面积的一半左右。过去哈斯人民在见面时问的是有无面包，现在，哈斯地区生产的粮食不仅能够满足本地居民的需要，而且
  还有余粮卖给国家。比如“三烈士”农业
  合作社五年以前还只能勉强维持社内三
  个月口粮，今年这个社不仅已能保证粮
  食自给，还向国家交售了余粮二百公担。
      歌唱新生活
      过去，哈斯人民在民歌里曾记述过
  哈斯地区的贫困和干旱，倾诉过他们改变山乡面貌的强烈愿望。今天，在劳动党和霍查同志的英明领导下，愿望已经成为现实。哈斯人民编写出了崭新的歌曲，歌唱党和自己的伟大领袖，歌唱美好的社会主义新生活。在克鲁姆乡的八年制学校的庭院里，我们同全校师生一起听了少年民间歌手自编自演的一首哈斯新歌。他们纵情地歌唱：
    哈斯的土地，哈斯的山，
    干枯的哈斯千年无人管。
    自从来了亲娘劳动党，
    她把无穷的智慧带给咱。
    峻岭变成了米粮川，
    干旱的哈斯变容颜。……
