Students in Brazil Angrily Hold Demonstrations

Students burn the American flag to express their deep hatred for U.S. imperialism's active support of the military dictatorship.

New York, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of Brazilian students held several flash mobs on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro on the 22nd to strongly protest the recent series of fascist measures taken by the pro-American military dictatorship.

The demonstrating students also burned an American flag on the beach, expressing their deep hatred for U.S. imperialism's active support of the military dictatorship.

Since the 13th, the Costa e Silva pro-American military dictatorship has announced the so-called "Institutional Act," closed the parliament, placed all newspapers and radio stations under "military supervision," and carried out mass arrests. In the past few days, the Brazilian military has successively invaded the University of São Paulo and the University of Rio de Janeiro, arresting hundreds of students. At the same time, on the 20th, the military dictatorship also announced the dismissal of thousands of government employees. This further indicates that the recent fascist measures taken by the Brazilian military dictatorship are mainly aimed at suppressing the increasingly high revolutionary movement of the Brazilian people.

    新华社二十五日讯　里约热内卢消息：一批巴西学生二十二日在里约热内卢海滩上举行多起闪电集会，强烈抗议亲美军事独裁政权最近采取的一系列法西斯措施。
    示威学生在海滩上还烧毁了一面美国星条旗，表示他们对积极支持军事独裁统治的美帝国主义的极大仇恨。
    巴西科斯塔—席尔瓦亲美军事独裁政权从十三日晚宣布所谓“制度法”后，封闭了议会，对所有报纸、电台进行“军事监督”并进行大逮捕。在前几天巴西军队又相继侵入圣保罗大学和里约热内卢大学，逮捕了数百名学生。同时，在二十日军事独裁政权又宣布裁减政府雇员数千人。这就进一步表明，巴西军事独裁政权最近采取的法西斯措施主要是为了镇压日益高涨的巴西人民的革命运动。
