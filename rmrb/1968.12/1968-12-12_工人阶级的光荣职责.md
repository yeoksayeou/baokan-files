The workers of Tianjin Cable Factory proudly declare: "Our factory not only needs to produce good products for socialism, but also to cultivate reliable revolutionary successors for the proletariat. This is our great mission."

Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant "March 7" directive, and during the discussion in the People's Daily about transferring public primary schools to the commune level, Yanan Middle School was placed under the leadership of the Tianjin Cable Factory Revolutionary Committee this November.

Revolutionary successors must be cultivated by the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves

Factories running schools is a great mission entrusted to us by the great leader Chairman Mao.

We have calculated that in the past, several poor and lower-middle peasants could barely support one university student. However, these students, having been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, forgot their roots, lacked the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and only wanted to become "experts" and "engineers." Take our cable factory as an example: since 1960, twenty university graduates have come here. Some of them, upon arriving at the factory, demanded to be guided by a certain "foreign" engineer with a specific major, refusing to get close to the workers; some only believed in foreign materials and looked down on the workers' technicians; some complained that the factory was too small and lacked a laboratory. For such students, the broad masses of workers are not satisfied.

This incident made us deeply realize that who holds the power of education, who runs the schools, and what ideology is used to educate the next generation are all major issues that determine whether the country changes color. In the past, students educated according to Liu Shaoqi's black line were like this, while our children of workers, peasants, and soldiers were excluded from the school gates by their rules. If this continues, who will carry on the revolution? Workers say: "Our factory not only needs to produce good products for socialism, but also to cultivate reliable revolutionary successors for the proletariat. This is our great mission."

Factories running schools show great superiority

In less than a month, the factory-run school has shown great superiority.

Factories running schools means that the party, government, financial, and cultural powers of the school are all in the hands of the working class, thus fundamentally ending the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools and truly implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive that the working class should "permanently lead the schools."

Factories running schools make the broad masses of workers care about the educational revolution. Workers not only actively participate in managing the school but also proactively educate the younger generation. Many workers see that revolutionary teachers and students are making rapid progress under their education and excitedly say: "Seeing a new generation grow up before our eyes, we are at ease."

Workers' boundless love for Chairman Mao, their insistence on learning and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought in practice, their selfless spirit, and their excellent qualities constantly influence revolutionary teachers and students. Teachers and students say: Now that we have more contact with workers, their good thoughts, good virtues, and good styles, we can see, touch, and learn from, which is really great!

After the working class took over the school, a large number of worker-teachers took to the school stage, and more than half of the teachers were sent to factories, rural areas, and border regions to receive re-education from the workers and peasants. The school's struggle, criticism, and reform process accelerated, and a new situation emerged: accountants also became mathematics teachers, and the library, laboratory, and broadcasting station canceled full-time staff and were managed by students.

In factory-run schools, continuously improve political awareness

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." Our cable factory deeply feels from running the school that: factories running schools are a good opportunity for us, the working class, to learn and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought and continuously improve our political awareness. The broad masses of workers say: Chairman Mao trusts us so much, entrusting us with the heavy responsibility of educating the new generation, so we have the responsibility to bring them up well.

After Yanan Middle School was managed by the cable factory, many workers became more loyal to Chairman Mao, learned and applied Chairman Mao Zedong Thought better than before, and the working class's sense of mastery and revolutionary responsibility became stronger. The revolutionary spirit of the young warriors inspired all revolutionary workers, and the factory's momentum of "grasp revolution and promote production" was greater than ever. In the first month after Yanan Middle School was led by the cable factory, that is, November, the cable factory created the highest production record since this year and since the factory was established. At the beginning, some comrades were worried that running the school would increase the burden, bring trouble, and create chaos. Now, after seeing this situation, they all excitedly say: The original worries were not only unnecessary but also redundant; as long as we strictly implement Chairman Mao's educational line, truly understand the great significance of factories running schools, fully mobilize the masses, improve the working class's revolutionary responsibility, strengthen leadership, and make good arrangements, we will definitely be able to run the school well!

    工人阶级的光荣职责
    天津电缆厂的工人同志豪迈地说：“咱们工厂不仅要为社会主义出好产品，而且要为无产阶级培养可靠的革命接班人，这是我们的伟大使命。”
    在伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“三·七”指示指引下，在《人民日报》开展关于公办小学下放到大队来办的大讨论的时候，延安中学于今年十一月划归天津电缆厂革命委员会领导。
    革命的接班人必须由工农兵自己来培养
    工厂办学校，这是伟大领袖毛主席赋予我们工人阶级的伟大使命。
    我们曾算过一笔账：过去得好几个贫下中农才能养得起一个大学生；可是这些大学生由于中了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒，有些人忘了本，缺乏工农兵的感情，一心想当“专家”、“工程师”。拿我们电缆厂来说，从一九六○年以来，先后来了二十名大学毕业生。他们之中有的一到工厂来，就指名道姓要求让某某专科毕业的“洋”工程师带他，就是不肯接近工人；有的只迷信外国资料，看不起工人技术员；有的嫌工厂太小，没有试验大楼。对于这样的学生，广大工人群众是不合心的。
    这件事使我们深刻地认识到：教育大权掌握在谁家手里，由谁来办学校，用什么思想培养后代，这是关系到国家变不变颜色的大问题。过去按照刘少奇那条黑线培养出来的是这样的学生，而我们工农兵的子女又被他们的条条框框排挤在校门之外，长此下去，让谁来接革命的班？工人们说：“咱们工厂不仅要为社会主义出好产品，而且要为无产阶级培养可靠的革命接班人，这是我们的伟大使命。”
    工厂办学显示出巨大的优越性
    在不到一个月的时间里，工厂办学校已经显示出了巨大的优越性。
    工厂办学校，学校的党政财文大权都由工人阶级来掌握，这就从根本上结束了资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，使毛主席关于工人阶级要“永远领导学校”的最新指示真正得到落实。
    工厂办学校，使广大工人群众人人关心教育革命，职工不仅积极地参予管理学校的事，而且主动地对青年一代进行教育。许多工人看到革命师生在自己教育下进步很快，兴奋地说：“看到一代新人在自己身边成长，我们也就放心了。”
    工人们无限热爱毛主席，处处坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，事事同旧社会对比，一心为公的优秀品质，时刻影响着革命师生。师生们说：现在同工人接触多了，他们的好思想、好品德、好作风，我们看得见，摸得着，学得到，实在是好得很！
    工人阶级当了学校的家以后，大批工人教师登上了学校的讲台，使一半以上的教员下放到工厂、农村和边疆去接受工农群众的再教育。学校的斗、批、改进程加快了，出现了一派新气象：会计兼了数学教员，图书馆、实验室、广播站取消了专职人员而由学生来管理。
  在工厂办学中不断提高政治觉悟
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们电缆厂从办校中深刻地体会到：工厂办学校，这对我们工人阶级也是一个活学活用毛泽东思想和不断提高自己政治觉悟的好机会。广大工人群众说：毛主席他老人家这样信任我们，把教育新一代的重任交给我们，我们就有责任把他们带好。
    延安中学由电缆厂管理后，许多工人对毛主席更忠了，活学活用毛泽东思想比以前更好了，工人阶级的主人翁思想和革命责任感更强了。革命小将朝气蓬勃的革命精神感染了广大革命职工，全厂“抓革命，促生产”的劲头比过去更大了。延安中学由电缆厂领导后的第一个月，即十一月份，电缆厂创造了今年以来，也是建厂以来的生产最高纪录。开始，有个别同志担心工厂办学校会增加负担，带来麻烦，添了乱子。现在看到这个情景以后都兴奋地说：原来的担心不仅是不应该的，而且也是多余的；只要我们不折不扣地执行毛主席的教育路线，真正理解工厂办学校的伟大意义，充分发动群众，提高工人阶级的革命责任感，加强领导，做好安排，就一定能够把学校办好！
