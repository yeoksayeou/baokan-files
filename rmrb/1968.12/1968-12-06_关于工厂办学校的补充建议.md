We believe that if schools are to be run by factories, the following issues must be addressed:

1. Rapidly establish a teaching corps with workers as the mainstay. Currently, efforts must be made to purge the teaching staff of all counter-revolutionary elements. Those who are unfit to be teachers should be reassigned. The proportion of workers in the teaching staff should be significantly increased, and a group of outstanding workers with practical experience should be selected to join the teaching corps. Urban and suburban primary and secondary school teachers should be sent to factories in batches for labor training. Those teachers who are sent down for labor should not be limited to working in the factories to which they are assigned; they can also go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

2. In addition to participating in factory labor, students and teachers in general urban and suburban schools should also engage in a certain amount of agricultural labor during the peak farming season each year. Schools run by factories can be appropriately decentralized based on the factory area to ensure a reasonable layout. Implement a seven-year or nine-year continuous education system, abolishing the previous practice of dividing primary and secondary schools into segments and campuses. Students should attend school near their neighborhoods and factory areas, and boarding students should not be accepted.

Jiangsu Province Jingjiang County Urban Primary and Secondary Schools All Revolutionary Teachers

After reading the suggestion published in the People's Daily regarding the direct management of urban primary and secondary schools by factories, I wholeheartedly agree. I would like to supplement the suggestion that all ordinary middle schools nationwide should be transformed into secondary technical schools. Factories can select and compile textbooks based on local conditions. Students should not only learn literature but also learn technical skills and criticize the bourgeoisie. This approach can thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line of "high school is for supplying talents to colleges and universities," fully implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and the teaching of combining theory with practice.

    关于工厂办学校的补充建议
    一
    我们认为，学校由工厂来办，必须解决以下几个问题：
    一、迅速树立起一支以工人为主体的教师队伍。目前，要狠抓清理教师队伍的工作，把那些混入教师队伍的一切反革命分子全部清洗出去，那些不适宜当教师的人，应调换他们的工作。在职教师中要大大增加工人成份，选拔一批有实践经验的优秀工人加入教师队伍。现有的城镇中小学教师应分期分批地到工厂进行劳动锻炼。二、一般中小城镇学校的师生，除参加工厂劳动外，在每年农村大忙季节，还应参加一定时间的农业劳动，下放劳动的教师，不一定局限在所属工厂劳动，也可以下农村，接受贫下中农的再教育。三、学校由工厂来办，可以根据厂区范围，将原来规模较大的学校适当分散，保证布局合理；实行七年一贯制或九年一贯制，废除以前将中小学分段分校的制度，学生按街道和工厂区就近入学，不收寄宿生。　江苏省靖江县城中小学全体革命教师二  看了《人民日报》发表的关于城市小学及中学由工厂直接管理的建议，我举双手赞成。现在补充建议全国普通中学，全部改为中等技术学校。工厂可根据本地情况选编教材，学生不但学文，还要学工，批判资产阶级。这样办就可以彻底粉碎“高中就是为大专院校输送人材”这一修正主义办学路线，全面落实毛主席的“五·七”指示和理论联系实际的教导。　北京房山县中学　常绥远
