A poor peasant named Gong Xianhuan from Xiandian Production Brigade, Xiandian Commune, Huangpi County, Hubei Province, was deeply moved by the sight of soldiers from the People's Liberation Army frequently wading through the cold waters of the Huangpi River to come to the brigade and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants to hold study classes and implement the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. The cold river water soaked the soldiers, but it pierced the heart of the old poor peasant, Gong Xianhuan. He deeply felt that with the great leader Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the People's Liberation Army, which fights for the people and protects the people's gains, there is today's life for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Uncle Gong then repaired an old wooden boat and volunteered to ferry the soldiers across the river.

One morning, Uncle Gong, facing the rising sun in the east, ferried the soldiers across the river. In the evening, he ferried them back. He rowed the boat to the riverbank and thought, "Two soldiers who crossed the river this morning haven't returned yet. What should I do?" Uncle Gong remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly," and decided to wait by the river for his comrades. Uncle Gong's body was covered with frost, and he braved the biting north wind, reciting "Resolutely to carry out the task, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," until dawn.

The eastern sky lit up with countless rays of light, and the soldiers Hu Dahai and Yuan Datang sang "The East Is Red" as they walked towards the ferry. It turned out that these two soldiers had studied Chairman Mao's report at the 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee with the poor and lower-middle peasants and criticized the heinous crimes of the traitor Liu Shaoqi until deep into the night. The poor and lower-middle peasants cared for the soldiers, reported to the unit by telephone, and then let them rest in their homes.

When these two soldiers arrived at the ferry, they saw Uncle Gong with a beard full of silver and frost all over his body, and they realized that Uncle Gong had been waiting for them by the river all night. Hu Dahai and Yuan Datang tightly grasped Uncle Gong's hands and shouted repeatedly, "Learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    渡口之夜
    湖北黄陂县向店公社向店大队贫农社员龚贤欢，看到生产队附近黄陂河对岸的解放军经常趟着冰冷的河水，来到队里和贫下中农一起办学习班，一起落实党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务的动人情景，内心感动万分。河水冷在子弟兵身上，痛在老贫农龚贤欢的心里。他深深感到有了伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有了为人民打江山、保江山的解放军，才有贫下中农的今天。龚大伯便修补了一只小木船，为过河的解放军当义务摆渡员。
    一天早晨，龚大伯迎着东方旭日，把解放军送过了河；傍晚时刻，又把解放军同志渡了回来。他把小船划到河边，心里一盘算，今天早晨过河的解放军还有两名没回来。怎么办？龚大伯想起了毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，决心在河边等候亲人。龚大伯浑身挂满了冰霜，顶着凛冽的北风，背诵着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一直等到黎明。
    东方射出霞光万道，战士胡大海、袁大堂高唱着《东方红》，朝河边渡口走来了。原来这两名解放军战士同贫下中农一起学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，一起批判大叛徒刘少奇的滔天罪行，一直战斗到深夜。贫下中农关心战士，用电话报告部队后，便把他们留在自己家里休息了。
    当这两名战士走到河边渡口时，看到龚大伯银须满腮，冰霜满身，方知龚大伯为了他俩在河边等候了一夜。胡大海、袁大堂紧紧地握住龚大伯的双手，不停地高呼：“向贫下中农学习！毛主席万岁！万万岁！”　    七三报道组
