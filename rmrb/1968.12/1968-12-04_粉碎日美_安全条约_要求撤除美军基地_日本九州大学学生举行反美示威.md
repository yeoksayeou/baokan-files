Three hundred students gathered around the wreckage of the American aggressor plane, denouncing the school authorities for colluding with the Japanese and American reactionaries to remove the plane wreckage, aiming to destroy evidence and cover up the crimes of U.S. imperialism. The students then stormed the university administration building, warning the authorities to stop all actions colluding with the Japanese and American reactionaries. The students then marched to the streets, protesting in Fukuoka City, shouting slogans such as "Remove the Pampan Base" and "Crush the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'."

Later, the students marched towards the Pampan U.S. military base. At this time, the reactionary Sato government, frightened by the students' struggle, dispatched a large number of police to brutally suppress the protesting students. The students bravely fought back against the police.

When the students reached the Pampan base, the reactionary Sato government dispatched a large number of police to surround the base and used several armored vehicles to block the base entrance, obstructing the students' anti-U.S. struggle. However, the students, undeterred by the police threats, held a rally at the U.S. military base, vowing to unite with the broad masses of the Japanese people to continue the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the East Asia News Agency reported: The struggle of Japanese students against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the reactionary and decaying capitalist education system is continuing to expand and develop.

Students at Tokyo University of Education, who are continuing their strike, fought with a group of lackeys sent by the Japan Communist Party's revisionist faction led by Miyamoto to disrupt the students' struggle on November 26, repelling their attack and foiling the Japan Communist Party's revisionist faction's plot to disrupt the strike.

Inspired by the university students' anti-U.S. patriotic struggle, more and more high school students have recently actively joined the ranks of the struggle against the Japanese and American reactionaries. Progressive students from 46 high schools in Osaka Prefecture held a rally in Osaka City on November 23, deciding to establish a united struggle organization for high school students to fight against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam, and oppose the reactionary education system. Students from about ten high schools in six prefectures in the Tohoku region also held a meeting in Sendai City on the same day, establishing a similar organization.

    粉碎日美“安全条约”  要求撤除美军基地
    日本九州大学学生举行反美示威
    新华社三日讯　据东方通讯社报道，十二月二日是一架美国强盗飞机坠入九州大学校园内半周年，这一天九州大学学生举行反美集会和示威游行，强烈谴责美日反动派的这一罪行，并且要求撤除板付美军基地。
    当天，三百名学生聚集在美国军用飞机残骸周围，纷纷谴责学校当局伙同美日反动派企图把这架飞机残骸搬走，以消灭罪证，掩盖美帝罪行的阴谋。接着，学生们冲进了大学办公楼，警告大学当局必须停止一切同美日反动派勾结的行动。学生们列队走向街头，在福冈市内游行示威，高呼“撤除板付基地”“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”等口号。
    随后，学生们向板付美军基地前进。这时，被学生斗争吓破了胆的佐藤反动政府，出动大批警察，野蛮地镇压示威学生，学生们英勇地同警察进行了搏斗。
    当学生到达板付基地时，佐藤反动政府又派出大批警察守围在基地周围，并用数辆装甲车挡在基地大门前，阻挠学生们的反美斗争。但是，学生们不顾警察的威胁，在这个美军基地举行了集会，表示决心团结日本广大人民群众，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本学生反对日美“安全条约”和反动腐朽的资本主义教育制度的斗争正在继续扩大和发展。
    正在坚持罢课斗争的东京教育大学学生，十一月二十六日同日共宫本修正主义集团派到学校来破坏学生斗争的一批娄罗进行搏斗，打退了他们的进攻，粉碎了日共宫本修正主义集团破坏罢课斗争的阴谋。
    在大学生反美爱国斗争的鼓舞下，最近，越来越多的高中学生积极参加了反对美日反动派的斗争行列。大阪府四十六所高级中学的进步学生十一月二十三日在大阪市举行集会，决定成立高中学生联合斗争的组织，为粉碎日美“安全条约”、反对美帝国主义的侵越战争、反对反动的教育制度而斗争。东北地区六个县的十几所高级中学的学生，也在同一天在仙台市开会，成立了同样的组织。
