In the countryside, the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the guiding path for the five hundred million peasants to walk on the broad road of socialism. In Sichuan Province, Wenchang County, Qingping Commune, Gaolou Brigade, the Fifth Production Team, three PLA soldiers have, in the course of struggle, firmly grasped the education of the struggle between the two lines, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line take root in the minds of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members, transforming this production team from a backward one into an advanced one.

The Fifth Production Team has thirty-five households, of which twenty-nine are poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants, who suffered heavy exploitation and oppression in the old society, love Chairman Mao and socialism boundlessly. Since liberation, they have followed the great leader Chairman Mao, from mutual aid teams to cooperatives, and then to people's communes, advancing steadily on the road of socialism. However, the great traitor, great internal spy, and great swindler Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Southwest China and Sichuan pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside, causing great harm to the commune members. Especially in 1962, after Liu Shaoqi blew the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" in the countryside, some people in this production team were busy with their individual plans for getting rich. Originally, the Fifth Production Team had fertile land, abundant water, and strong labor force, but production declined year after year, resulting in it becoming a notorious backward team in the entire commune.

The PLA soldiers Wang Zhenjiang, Zhang Dejin, and Yu Shihua were sent to the Fifth Production Team to support agriculture last October. After they learned about the history and current situation of this production team, they deeply realized that to change the backward face of this team, they must firmly grasp the education of the struggle between the two lines, making the commune members understand what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and what is Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and then guide them to use Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the revisionist line and eliminate its poisonous influence.

How to carry out the struggle between the two lines in the countryside? Wang Zhenjiang and his comrades-in-arms followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "class struggle, once grasped, is effective," using the army's experience of "two remembrances and three examinations," mobilizing the masses to carry out the "three remembrances and three reflections" activity. The "three remembrances and three reflections" are: first, remembrance of the bitterness of the old society and reflection on the sweetness of the new society; second, remembrance of the bitterness of individual farming and reflection on the sweetness of socialist collectivization; third, remembrance of the bitterness suffered by the poor and lower-middle peasants due to Liu Shaoqi's pushing of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and reflection on the sweetness brought by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, when talking about the struggle between the two lines, peasants always thought it was something they could not see or touch. This time, through the "three remembrances and three reflections," the poor and lower-middle peasants used their own personal experiences to lay out the struggle between the two lines over the past decade or more. Poor peasant commune member Wang Shucui's old grandmother recounted at the remembrance meeting: "In the old society, our ancestors were exploited. I was a wet nurse for the landlord, my milk fattened the landlord's puppies, while my three children starved to death right in front of me. If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to revolt, if it weren't for walking the socialist path, my family would have rotted away to nothing. Liu Shaoqi's nonsense about 'exploitation being beneficial' and 'exploitation saving people' is all bullshit; he and the landlords and capitalists are wearing the same pants and walking the same path." Wu Po, who had been a servant in a landlord's house for over thirty years and suffered greatly, is now seventy-eight years old. Her teeth have fallen out, her ears and eyes are not good, and she has difficulty walking. When the remembrance meeting was held, she had someone push her to the venue in a cart. Wu Po said: "Before liberation, we farmed individually for generations, so poor that we didn't even have a clod of earth to scare crows with. Chairman Mao led us to overturn the situation, and only by walking the collective path do the poor and lower-middle peasants have today's happy life; Liu Shaoqi wants us to farm individually again, this is pushing us into a pit of fire." The more they laid out, the more they loved Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; the more they laid out, the more they hated Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Fifth Team said: What kind of seed sprouts what kind of flower, what kind of vine bears what kind of melon, Liu Shaoqi is the filial son and grandson of landlords and capitalists, he is our poor and lower-middle peasants' sworn enemy. We must resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and resolutely smash Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line!

Over the past decade or more, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Fifth Team have suffered from the "four freedoms" and "three freedoms and one contract," and have been harmed by Liu Shaoqi's black goods "Peach Garden Experience," which is a rightist, capitalist, reactionary line disguised as "leftist." They laid out their personal experiences, which became the most vivid and living textbook for their own education. Based on the remembrance of bitterness and sweetness, Wang Zhenjiang and his comrades then guided everyone to carry out revolutionary criticism, further distinguishing the boundaries between the two lines and raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The enthusiasm of the masses was high; during a rest while working in the fields, they would hang up Chairman Mao's portrait and insert a big red flag at the field edge, then fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Southwest China who pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. In the evenings, the masses went to study classes, and many old people, women, and children also voluntarily participated; the study classes were held without interruption even in wind and rain.

In the course of the criticism, Wang Zhenjiang and others also promoted the practice of "one criticism per incident" among the masses, using living education to make everyone, when facing an incident, able to distinguish the boundaries between the two lines. One evening, Wang Zhenjiang heard a commune member say that during the day, while carrying manure, he stepped on a family's private plot of peas and was scolded. Wang Zhenjiang went to the scene to see: the peas on the ridge of the private plot were indeed stepped on twice, but in the collective field next to it, a path more than a foot wide had been trampled. After returning, he discussed with everyone and decided to move that evening's study class to the field. The commune members, holding lanterns, came to the field edge, looked at the scene, studied Chairman Mao's works, and carried out revolutionary criticism. Some commune members spoke well: The collective field was trampled with a path and it didn't hurt, but the private plot was stepped on twice and it resulted in a big scolding, this is the poison of revisionist thinking that has not been eliminated, the capitalist "self" is playing tricks in the mind, and the awareness of guarding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is not high. The effect of "one criticism per incident" was very good, and the commune members generally reflected: What is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and what is Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line; what is the socialist path and what is the capitalist path, a comparison and criticism made it clear in their hearts and brightened their eyes. Afterwards, whenever the team handled an affair or a problem, it was also linked to the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and the insistence on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the course of the struggle between the two lines, Wang Zhenjiang and the other three soldiers also did a great deal of painstaking and detailed political and ideological work. Wang Zhenjiang and the other three soldiers' approach had a great educational effect on the team's cadres. They saw that doing political and ideological work was to plant Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deep in the hearts of every commune member.

Under the painstaking and detailed work of Wang Zhenjiang and the other three soldiers, the struggle between the two lines in the Fifth Team deepened step by step. They guided the poor and lower-middle peasants to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze, criticize, and struggle in real struggles and real life, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line occupy all positions in the countryside. They mobilized the masses to set up family Mao Zedong Thought study classes and family struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism meetings, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line penetrate into every family. Among fathers and sons, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, when facing an incident, is it for the collective or the individual? Is it for the public or the private? Is it to listen to Chairman Mao's words or to listen to the words whispered in one's ear? Now everyone has clear boundaries and a clear direction. Many people said in the family study class: "In our family, it is Mao Zedong Thought that should be in charge, it is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that should be in charge!"

    让毛主席革命路线在群众头脑里扎根
    ——记一个由三个战士组成的支农小组狠抓两条路线斗争教育的事迹
    在农村，伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是引导五亿农民走社会主义康庄大道的路线。在四川省温江县清平公社高楼大队第五生产队支农的三个解放军战士，在斗争中狠抓两条路线斗争教育，让毛主席的革命路线在贫下中农和广大社员的头脑里扎根，使这个生产队人换精神地换貌，后进队变成了先进队。
    第五生产队共有三十五户，其中有二十九户是贫下中农。在旧社会受了沉重的剥削和压迫的贫下中农，无限热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义。解放以来，他们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，从互助组到合作社，又到人民公社，在社会主义大道上不断前进。但是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其在西南、四川的代理人在农村大肆推行反革命修正主义路线，使社员们深受其害。尤其是一九六二年，刘少奇在农村刮起“三自一包”的黑风后，这个生产队有些人忙着个人的发家计划，本来土地肥、水源足、劳力强的第五生产队，生产年年下降，结果，成了全公社有名的后进队。
    解放军战士王振刚、张德金、喻世华是去年十月到第五生产队支农的。当他们了解了这个生产队的历史和现状以后，深刻地认识到：要改变这个队的落后面貌，就必须狠抓两条路线斗争的教育，使社员懂得什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，进而引导他们以毛主席的革命路线为武器，彻底批判修正主义路线，并且肃清它的流毒。
    怎样在农村中开展两条路线斗争教育呢？王振刚和他的战友遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，运用部队两忆三查的经验，发动群众开展了“三忆三思”活动。这“三忆三思”是一忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜；二忆单干的苦，思社会主义集体化的甜；三忆刘少奇推行反革命修正主义路线使贫下中农受的苦，思毛主席无产阶级革命路线给贫下中农带来的甜。过去讲两条路线斗争，农民总以为是看不到、摸不着。这次，通过三忆三思，贫下中农用自己的亲身经历，一下子把十几年来的两条路线斗争摆开了。贫农社员王树清老大娘在忆苦会上控诉说：“在旧社会，我们祖祖辈辈受剥削。我给地主当奶妈，奶水喂肥了地主的狗崽子，自己的三个娃儿眼睁睁地饿死了。要不是毛主席领导我们闹革命，要不是走社会主义道路，我一家人骨头渣子都烂没了。刘少奇胡说什么‘剥削有功’，‘剥削救人’，完全是满嘴喷粪，他和地主、资本家穿的是一条裤子，走的是一条路子。”在地主家当过三十多年佣人受尽了苦的吴婆婆，今年七十八岁了，牙掉了，耳朵、眼睛都不好使了，走路也困难，开忆苦会时，她叫人用车把她推到会场。吴婆婆说：“解放前，我们几辈子单干，穷得连块打老鸦的泥巴都没有。毛主席领导我们翻了身，贫下中农走集体化道路才有今天的幸福生活；刘少奇又叫我们单干，这是要把我们推到火坑里去。”大家越摆，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越亲；越摆，对刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线越恨。五队贫下中农说：啥子秧秧开啥子花，啥子藤藤结啥子瓜，刘少奇是地主、资本家的孝子贤孙，是我们贫下中农的死对头。我们要坚决站在毛主席革命路线这一边，坚决把刘少奇的那条反革命修正主义路线砸烂！
    十几年来，五队的贫下中农吃过“四大自由”、“三自一包”的苦头，受过刘少奇的黑货“桃园经验”的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线的害。他们把亲身的经历摆出来，就成了自己教育自己的最生动的一部活教材。在忆苦思甜的基础上，王振刚和他的战友便引导大家开展革命大批判，进一步划清两条路线的界限，提高两条路线斗争觉悟。群众的热情很高，在田间干活一休息，就在地头上挂起毛主席像，插上大红旗，然后狠批刘少奇及其在西南的代理人推行的反革命修正主义黑货。晚上，群众到学习班学习，一些老人、妇女、小孩也都自愿参加；学习班做到刮风下雨不误开课。
    在大批判中，王振刚等还在群众中推广了“一事一批”的做法，通过活的教育，使大家一事当前，能够分清两条路线的界限。一天晚上，王振刚听一个社员说，白天挑粪时，踩了一家自留地的豌豆，被那家骂了一顿。王振刚听了后，就到现场去看：自留地的田坎上的豌豆是踩了两脚，可是在旁边集体的地里，竟踩出一条一尺多宽的小道。回来后，他和大家一商量，决定把当天晚上的学习班搬到田间去办。社员们提着马灯，来到地头，看了现场，学习了毛主席著作，开展了革命大批判。有的社员讲得好：集体的地踩了一条路不心疼，自留地踩了两脚就大骂一场，这就是修正主义思想的流毒还没有肃清，资产阶级“私”字在头脑中作怪，卫护毛主席革命路线的觉悟不高的具体表现。“一事一批”的效果很好，社员普遍反映：什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线；什么是社会主义道路，什么是资本主义道路，一对比一批判，心里就明了，眼睛就亮了。以后，队里每办一件事情、处理一个问题，也都同批判反革命修正主义路线，坚持毛主席的革命路线联系起来。
    在进行两条路线斗争教育中，王振刚等三个战士，还做了大量的艰苦细致的政治思想工作。王振刚等三个战士的做法，对队里干部教育很大。他们看到，做政治思想工作，就是要把毛泽东思想，把毛主席的革命路线扎根到每个社员的心窝里。
    在王振刚等三个战士艰苦细致的工作下，五队的两条路线斗争教育步步深入。他们在现实斗争和现实生活中一发现问题，就引导贫下中农用毛泽东思想去分析、批判、斗争，使毛主席的革命路线占领农村的一切阵地。他们通过发动群众开办家庭毛泽东思想学习班、家庭斗私批修会，使毛主席的革命路线深入到每个家庭中去。在父子之间，夫妻之间，兄弟姐妹之间，一事当前，是为大家，还是为小家？是为公，还是为私？是听毛主席的话，还是听家人的耳边话？现在大家对这些，都界限清，方向明。许多人在家庭学习班上说：“我们这个家，就是要让毛泽东思想当家，让毛主席的革命路线当家！”
