The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out clearly during the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan:

	“Without an army of the people, there is nothing of the people.” This is an absolute truth.

	After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi vigorously advocated the “peaceful democratic new stage,” pushing the line of capitulation. He blathered on about how “Chiang Kai-shek will not wage civil war,” openly proposing to reorganize the people’s army into the “regular army,” “national defense army,” “local security forces,” and “self-defense forces” under the unified leadership of Chiang Kai-shek’s Ministry of Defense. He shamelessly advocated that doing so could “exchange for national democratization, which means giving in on the military front, and making great progress nationwide.” Liu Shaoqi attempted to dissolve and betray the People’s Liberation Army, with the evil intention of sabotaging the revolution.

	Did Chiang Kai-shek really stop waging civil war? No, Chiang Kai-shek, this butcher who kills without blinking, would never put down his knife and become a Buddhist. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese landlords and big capitalists, represented by Chiang Kai-shek, wanted to seize the fruits of victory from the people’s hands, so they had to launch a civil war.

	After tearing up the “Double Ten Agreement,” in 1946, with the strong support of his American imperialist masters, Chiang Kai-shek gathered 193 divisions of regular troops to launch a large-scale armed attack on our liberated areas in Su-Xu, Shandong, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Northeast, and Jin-Cha-Ji. Chiang Kai-shek boasted that he would annihilate the People’s Liberation Army inside and outside the Great Wall within three to six months. At this crucial historical juncture, which determined the fate of the Chinese revolution and its future, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi vigorously advocated reorganizing the people’s army, handing over the people’s army to the Kuomintang’s Chiang Kai-shek. Wasn’t this helping Chiang Kai-shek annihilate our people’s army? If Liu Shaoqi’s conspiracy had succeeded, the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance, won with the blood and lives of countless revolutionary martyrs, would have fallen into the hands of the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek; the hundreds of millions of people who had already been liberated would have fallen back under his rule. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi was clearly betraying the revolution, helping Chiang Kai-shek implement his plan to usurp the fruits of victory, and acting as Chiang Kai-shek’s accomplice.

	The army is the main component of state power, which is a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism. The proletarian revolution must have a powerful army to overthrow the reactionaries and establish and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. The bourgeoisie also knows the importance of controlling the army when staging a counterrevolution. The history of the Chinese revolution fully proves that the reactionaries will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history without being defeated. Every inch of land we have seized and every village we have occupied is the result of the People’s Liberation Army fighting to the death against Chiang Kai-shek’s reactionaries. Conversely, if we give up the army and armed struggle, the revolution will fail, and the people will suffer. During the first domestic revolutionary war, due to Chen Duxiu’s right-opportunist line, which abandoned armed struggle, our party was completely unprepared for Chiang Kai-shek’s counterrevolutionary coup, suffering severe losses. This bloody lesson must never be forgotten!

	The “peace” smoke screen released by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi cannot deceive the people’s army armed with Mao Zedong Thought; the frenzied armed attacks by American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek cannot frighten the heroic Chinese people. With the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary train is speeding forward. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: “Chiang Kai-shek always forces the people to accept war; he holds a knife in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. We will follow his example and pick up our knives too.” He also pointed out: “The rights the people have gained must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle.” We followed the great instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and came to Inner Mongolia, mobilizing the masses and expanding the people’s army. We organized comrades to repeatedly study Chairman Mao’s brilliant work, “The Situation After the Victory of the War of Resistance and Our Policy,” clearly seeing that the danger of civil war was very serious, and thus more firmly implementing Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and resisting the black directives of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. Comrades said, “A thousand words, ten thousand words, we listen to Chairman Mao’s words the most.” We, regardless of day or night, went deep into the Mongolian people, propagating Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line; exposing Chiang Kai-shek’s active preparations for civil war, attempting to usurp the fruits of the War of Resistance, and plotting to put the broad masses of people back under their cruel exploitation and rule. This greatly raised the awareness of the Mongolian people. Thus, a people’s armed force to defend the homeland was established. Before a few months had passed, the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, launched a large-scale armed attack on the liberated areas. Because we had established the people’s armed forces, the Kuomintang’s army’s multiple attacks were all repulsed one by one.

	The practice of struggle made us deeply feel that in class struggle, without an army, there is nothing of the people, nothing of the proletariat, and nothing of the Communist Party. Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of our party and army, the guiding light that leads China to brightness, and the guarantee of revolutionary victory.

### 交出军队，就是出卖革命

    交出军队，就是出卖革命
    铁道兵某部师长　张鸿智
    伟大领袖毛主席在抗日战争胜利时，就明确指出：
  “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这是千真万确的真理。
    日寇投降后，大叛徒刘少奇极力鼓吹“和平民主新阶段”，推行投降主义路线。他胡说什么：“蒋介石不打内战了”，明目张胆地提出把人民军队改编为蒋介石国防部统一领导的“正式国军”、“国防军”、“地方保安队”、“自卫军”。他还无耻地鼓吹这样做可以“换得全国民主化，就是军队让一步，全国大进步”。刘少奇妄图瓦解和出卖人民解放军，其罪恶目的就是断送革命。
    蒋介石真的不打内战了吗？不，蒋介石这个杀人不眨眼的刽子手，绝对不会放下屠刀，立地成佛。抗战胜利后，以蒋介石为代表的中国大地主大资产阶级，要从人民手中夺取抗日战争胜利果实，就要发动内战。
    蒋介石撕毁“双十协定”后，一九四六年在他的主子美帝国主义的大力支持下，聚集了一百九十三个旅的正规军的兵力，向我苏皖、山东、晋冀鲁豫、东北、晋察冀等解放区发动了大规模的武装进攻。蒋介石扬言在三至六个月内消灭关里、关外的人民解放军。在这关系到中国革命的两种命运、两个前途的重大历史关头，大叛徒刘少奇极力鼓吹改编人民军队，把人民军队交给国民党蒋介石，这不是在帮助蒋介石消灭我们人民军队吗？如果刘少奇这一阴谋得逞，无数革命烈士用生命和鲜血换来的抗战胜利果实，就会落到人民公敌蒋介石手中；已经得到解放的千百万人民，就会重新沦入他的统治之下。大叛徒刘少奇明明是在出卖革命，帮助蒋介石实现篡夺胜利果实的计划，充当蒋介石的帮凶。
    军队是国家政权的主要成份，这是马克思列宁主义的基本原理。无产阶级革命必须有一支强大的军队，才能消灭反动派，建立和巩固无产阶级政权。资产阶级搞反革命也知道掌握军队的重要。中国革命的历史充分地证明，灰尘不扫不走，反动派不打决不会自动退出历史舞台。我们夺得每一寸土地，占领每一个村庄，都是人民军队同蒋介石反动派浴血奋战的结果。反之，我们如果放弃了军队，放弃了武装斗争，革命就会失败，人民就要遭殃。第一次国内革命战争时期，由于陈独秀的右倾机会主义路线，放弃武装斗争，使我党对于蒋介石的反革命政变毫无准备，遭受了严重的损失。血的教训，永远不能忘记！
    大叛徒刘少奇施放的“和平”烟幕弹，骗不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队；美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的疯狂武装进攻，吓不倒英雄的中华儿女。有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，革命的列车飞驶前进。抗战胜利后，毛主席英明地指出：“蒋介石总是要强迫人民接受战争，他左手拿着刀，右手也拿着刀。我们就按照他的办法，也拿起刀来。”又指出：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的伟大指示来到了内蒙古，放手发动群众，壮大人民军队。我们组织同志们反复学习毛主席《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》这一光辉著作，清醒地看到内战危险是十分严重的，因而更加坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线，抵制了大叛徒刘少奇的黑指示。同志们说，千句话，万句话，我们最听毛主席的话。我们不管白天黑夜，深入到蒙古族人民中间去，宣传毛主席的革命路线；揭发蒋介石积极准备内战，妄图篡夺抗战的胜利果实，使广大人民重新处于他们的残酷剥削和统治之下的反革命阴谋。这就大大提高了蒙古族人民的觉悟。于是一支保卫家乡的人民武装建立起来了。没等几个月，人民公敌蒋介石向解放区发动了大规模的武装进攻。由于我们建立了人民武装，国民党军队的多次进攻，都被我们一一击退了。
    斗争的实践使我们深深体会到，在阶级斗争中，没有军队，就没有人民的一切，就没有无产阶级的一切，就没有共产党的一切。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我党我军的生命线，是把中国引向光明的指路明灯，是革命胜利的保证。
