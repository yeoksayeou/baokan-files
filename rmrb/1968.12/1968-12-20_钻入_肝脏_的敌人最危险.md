The birth of the great People's Republic of China marked the beginning of a new era of socialist revolution in China. At this crucial turning point in revolutionary history, our great leader Chairman Mao timely warned the entire Party to be on guard against the attacks of the bourgeoisie "with sugar-coated bullets" and to be vigilant against the class enemies who "adopt the policy of Sun Wukong burrowing into the belly of Princess Iron Fan to cause trouble." The history of the past nineteen years of fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, especially the class struggle of the past two and a half years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has repeatedly proven how wise and correct Chairman Mao's instructions are!

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our factory's class lines were in chaos, the class enemies were deeply hidden, and class struggle was extremely sharp and complex. Under the protection of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line for building the Party, some vicious class enemies have been running wild, and some have even infiltrated the Party, seized important positions, and frantically carried out evil activities to restore capitalism.

A fortress is most easily breached from within. To sabotage us, the enemy will disguise themselves as "revolutionaries" and try every means to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks. The class enemies in our factory used extremely treacherous counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to infiltrate the Party and wreak havoc in our "liver." One reactionary Party cadre, who hid himself before liberation, disguised himself as an active member after liberation, infiltrated the Party, and used his power to create an independent kingdom, suppressing and attacking the worker masses, imposing bourgeois dictatorship on the workers. Another scoundrel, who was a loyal dog of Japanese imperialism during the puppet regime and a "big shot" during the Kuomintang rule, transformed himself after liberation and infiltrated the Party. He was good at flattery and played the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick, deeply pleasing a small clique of capitalist-roaders in our factory, and was promoted and utilized. He fiercely opposed the workers' active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. When some worker comrades voluntarily organized Mao Zedong Thought study groups, he used the so-called "voluntary principle" to forcibly disband them. However, when Liu Shaoqi's black book "Self-Cultivation" was reissued, he distributed a copy to each Party member, spreading Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist poison.

These shocking class struggle facts show that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. The class enemies will never be content with their failure and will always engage in "life-and-death struggle" with the proletariat. However, due to the mighty power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, these cunning devils have to adopt covert methods, burrowing into the revolutionary ranks to carry out their conspiracies to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is easy to dodge open arrows, but difficult to guard against hidden ones. The most dangerous thing is when a small handful of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries infiltrate the Party and carry out evil deeds to restore capitalism within the revolutionary ranks!

The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" is a big black umbrella to protect a small handful of class enemies and a smoke screen for a ferocious attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must overturn and expose it! We must remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, never forget class struggle, heighten class vigilance, timely expose those Hruschev-like figures sleeping beside us, drag them out, clean them out, and fight them to the end!

    钻入“肝脏”的敌人最危险
    北京新华印刷厂　兰月春
    伟大的中华人民共和国的诞生，标志着中国社会主义革命新时期的开始。在这个革命历史的转折关头，我们的伟大领袖毛主席非常及时地告诫全党：要预防资产阶级“用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击”，警惕阶级敌人“采用孙行者钻进铁扇公主肚子里兴妖作怪的政策”。十九年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的历史，特别是两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪，反复地证明毛主席的这些指示是何等英明、何等正确啊！
    无产阶级文化大革命前，我们厂阶级阵线混乱，阶级敌人隐藏得非常深，阶级斗争也极其尖锐复杂。在大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和反革命修正主义建党路线的庇护下，一些穷凶极恶的阶级敌人一直逍遥法外，有的甚至钻入党内，窃踞要职，疯狂地进行复辟资本主义的罪恶活动。
    堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。敌人要破坏我们，就会乔装打扮成“革命”的样子，千方百计地钻进革命队伍。我们厂的阶级敌人就是采用极端阴险的反革命两面派手法混入党内，并在我们的“肝脏”里兴妖作怪的。有个反动党团骨干分子，解放前夕荫蔽潜藏下来。解放以后，他又伪装积极，钻进党内，并利用职权，大搞独立王国，压制打击工人群众，对工人实行资产阶级专政。还有一个坏家伙，在日伪统治时期是日本帝国主义的忠实走狗，在国民党统治时期是个“大红人”，解放以后又摇身一变，混入党内。他善于逢迎，大耍反革命两面派手法，深得我厂一小撮走资派的欢心，受到提拔重用。他疯狂地反对职工活学活用毛泽东思想。一些工人同志自动组织毛主席著作学习小组，他就借口所谓“自愿原则”，强行解散。但是，当刘少奇黑《修养》再次出笼时，他却发给党员人手一册，散布刘少奇的反革命修正主义毒素。
    这些惊心动魄的阶级斗争事实说明，在无产阶级专政条件下，仍然存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。阶级敌人对于他们的失败，是绝对不会甘心的，总要同无产阶级进行“拚死的斗争”的。但是由于无产阶级专政的强大威力，这些狡猾的魔鬼不得不采用荫蔽的方式，钻到革命队伍内部进行颠覆无产阶级专政的阴谋活动。明枪易躲，暗箭难防，从背后射来的箭最容易伤人。一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子混入党内，在革命队伍内部进行复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当，是最最危险的事！
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，是保护一小撮阶级敌人的大黑伞，是向无产阶级专政猖狂进攻的烟幕弹，我们一定要把它批倒、批臭！我们要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，提高阶级警惕，及时识破那些睡在我们身旁的赫鲁晓夫式的人物，把他们揪出来，清洗出去，斗倒斗臭！
