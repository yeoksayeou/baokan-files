The cooperative medical system is a new phenomenon that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are now publishing a report on the implementation of the cooperative medical system in Le Yuan Commune, Changyang County, Hubei Province, as well as the reflections and questions raised by the poor and lower-middle peasants, cadres, and medical workers of Huangcun and Liangxiang People's Communes in the Beijing suburbs during their discussions on this report. We are seeking opinions and initiating a discussion. As the poor and lower-middle peasants' management of schools has already begun to be widely implemented in rural areas, raising the discussion on rural medical systems will definitely promote the further implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian health line.

In December 1966, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's important instructions on health work, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Le Yuan Commune, Changyang County, Hubei Province, broke through the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the great traitor, great internal traitor, and great swindler Liu Shaoqi on the health front. They led and promoted revolutionary medical and health workers to break with the old and establish the new, and together with them, they actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. They created a new type of cooperative medical system, successfully solving the problem of poor and lower-middle peasants seeing a doctor and taking medicine to ensure their health.

The method of implementing cooperative medicine is as follows: Based on the medical situation and drug level of each member over the years, each person is required to pay one yuan per year for cooperative medical care. Each production team, according to the number of participants, pays an additional one jiao from the public welfare fund. Except for a few chronic diseases that require long-term medication, members pay only five fen for each medical consultation, and medication is free. The twelve medical staff of the commune health center, except for two who temporarily receive fixed wages, all receive work points like the main cadres of the brigade. To accommodate the high mobility and relatively high expenses of doctors, they are subsidized between three and five yuan per month depending on the situation. This thorough reform of the old system makes medical personnel both medical workers and farmers, marking a great revolution in the medical and health sector and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought in occupying the rural medical front.

Since January 1, 1967, except for the four types of people, 99% of the commune's population has voluntarily signed up for cooperative medical care. Many poor and lower-middle peasants, whenever they mention the cooperative medical system, are always moved to tears, deeply grateful to the great leader Chairman Mao, and unanimously praise the cooperative medical system as excellent.

The benefits of implementing cooperative medicine are numerous:

1. It solves the difficulty of poor and lower-middle peasants being unable to afford medical treatment and medicine, further embodying the Party and Chairman Mao's care for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "In the past, we only sought treatment when the disease was severe; now, we treat it as soon as we get sick, which is good for early recovery and production." The female peasant member of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Guo Jinlian, from the fifth production team of the second brigade, originally suffered from stomach disease. Due to the lack of medical treatment and medicine, a minor illness turned into a major one, causing her to lose her labor capacity. After the implementation of cooperative medicine, the doctor actively treated her, and she gradually recovered her labor capacity. Whenever Guo Jinlian talks about cooperative medicine, she is so excited that she shouts, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The poor and lower-middle peasant association member, Wang Zhitang, from the seventh production team of the third brigade, suffered from intestinal intussusception. The cooperative medicine actively treated him, and later the team took him to the county for surgery, curing him. In total, more than 200 yuan was spent. After Wang Zhitang recovered his health, he told everyone: "It was Chairman Mao who gave me a second life. If it weren't for the cooperative medicine, where would I have gotten so much money to see a doctor? I will educate my descendants to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, unchanging even if the sea dries up and the rocks crumble."

2. It truly implements the policy of "prevention first." In the past, doctors, for the sake of learning medical skills and increasing income, did not pay much attention to preventive work. After the implementation of cooperative medicine, they deeply felt the importance of doing a good job in preventive work. They took the lead in mobilizing the masses to launch a "people's war," conscientiously doing a good job in preventive work, and promoting the health of the members. Last spring, some surrounding areas of Le Yuan Commune successively experienced an outbreak of an infectious disease, but Le Yuan Commune, due to the implementation of cooperative medicine, everyone participated in prevention, using some economical and effective methods, and did not experience this infectious disease. Everyone deeply felt that this was the result of implementing cooperative medicine and implementing the policy of "prevention first."

3. It further mobilizes the class love of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, stimulates the enthusiasm of the members, and promotes the development of socialist health undertakings. The poor peasant member, Zheng Dingming, from the third production team of the fourth brigade, once had a cold. The doctor wanted to prescribe medicine for him, but he quickly treated himself with a folk remedy. He said: "My family of six only paid six yuan a year. If I take medicine for such a minor illness, it would use up the cooperative medicine money, and what if other class brothers get seriously ill? I will follow Chairman Mao's words and be selfless and dedicated to others." After the poor and lower-middle peasants took charge of the medical and health power, they showed a lofty communist style everywhere. At the beginning of the implementation of the cooperative medical system, some cadres and medical personnel did not believe in the masses' awareness and were worried that "if medicine and treatment are free, the pharmacy door will be crowded down, and the doctor's legs will be broken, and there will be no medicine to dispense with the prescription." Nearly two years of medical practice has proven that their worries are completely unfounded. The cooperative medical funds for last year and this year both have surpluses. The poor and lower-middle peasants care about cooperative medicine and cherish it, and the socialist health undertaking is becoming more and more consolidated.

4. It prevents the spread of bourgeois ideology, accelerates the thought and work revolution of medical personnel. In the past, delivering medicine and treatment was just talk; now, the medicine box is on the shoulder. In the past, they practiced medicine for wages; now, they practice medicine for the revolution. Under the continuous re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they take Comrade White as an example and truly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly. The Communist Party member and doctor, Tan Xiangguan, from the third brigade, only studied for three years in primary school. The poor and lower-middle peasants sent him to a traditional Chinese medicine advanced class held in the county for a year of study. He has been working diligently for several years, loyally serving the people. Especially through the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, his ideological awareness has greatly improved. After the implementation of cooperative medicine, he works day and night, crossing mountains and valleys, busy with outpatient services, and is heart to heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise him as a "White-like good doctor." The poor peasant member, Guo Yongxin, from the first production team of the fourth brigade, had a seriously ill child during the Spring Festival this year. Three doctors guarded and treated him, finally saving the child's life. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the warm care and re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, a revolutionary medical team at the Le Yuan Commune Health Center, warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, is growing vigorously.

### 深受贫下中农欢迎的合作医疗制度

    深受贫下中农欢迎的合作医疗制度
    编者按：合作医疗制度是一件无产阶级文化大革命中出现的新事物。现将湖北省长阳县乐园公社实行合作医疗制度的一篇报导，以及北京郊区黄村、良乡人民公社贫下中农、干部、医务工作者座谈这篇报导的反映和提出的问题，一并在报上发表，征求意见，展开讨论。当贫下中农管理学校已经开始在农村普遍实行的时候，我们提出农村医疗制度的讨论，一定会促进毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线的进一步贯彻执行。
    一九六六年十二月，湖北省长阳县乐园公社的贫下中农，在毛主席关于卫生工作一系列重要指示的指引下，冲破了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在卫生战线上的反革命修正主义路线，领导和促进了革命的医疗卫生工作者，破私立公，破旧立新，并且同他们一起在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，创造了一种新型的合作医疗制度，成功地解决了贫下中农看病吃药、确保健康的问题。
    实行合作医疗的办法是这样的：根据社员历年来的医疗情况、用药水平，确定每人每年交一元钱的合作医疗费，每个生产队按照参加人数，由公益金中再交一角钱。除个别老痼疾病需要常年吃药的以外，社员每次看病只交五分钱的挂号费，吃药就不要钱了。公社卫生所十二名医务人员，除两人暂时拿固定工资以外，其余十人都和大队主要干部一样记工分。为了照顾医生流动性大、花费比较多的特点，每月按情况不同补助三元到五元。这种彻底改革旧体制，使医务人员成为亦医亦农的劳动者，是医疗卫生战线上的一场大革命，是毛泽东思想占领农村医疗阵地的伟大胜利。
    从去年元月一日到现在，全公社除四类分子以外，已经有百分之九十九的人自愿报名参加了合作医疗。许多贫下中农一提起合作医疗制度，总是喜泪盈眶，万分感激伟大领袖毛主席，同声称赞合作医疗就是好。
    实行合作医疗的好处很多：
    一、解决了贫下中农看不起病、吃不起药的困难，进一步体现了党和毛主席对贫下中农的亲切关怀。贫下中农说：“过去病拖狠了才治，现在有病就治，早治早好，有利生产。”二大队第五生产队贫农女社员郭金莲，原来患胃病，由于缺医少药，小病拖成大病，丧失了劳动力；实行合作医疗以后，医生积极为她治疗，逐步恢复了劳动力。郭金莲一谈到合作医疗，就激动得高呼“毛主席万岁！”三大队第七生产队贫协小组成员王直堂，得了肠套叠，合作医疗积极为他治疗，后来队里把他抬到县里开刀，治好了，先后花了两百多元。王直堂恢复健康以后，逢人就说：“是毛主席他老人家给了我第二次生命，要不是办合作医疗，我那里花得起这么多钱看病？我要教育儿孙后代，永远忠于毛主席，海枯石烂不变心。”
    二、使“预防为主”的方针真正落实在行动上。以前，医生为了看病学技术、增收入，对预防工作一向不关心；实行合作医疗以后，他们深深感到做好预防工作的重要性，积极带头，发动群众，开展“人民战争”，踏踏实实做好预防工作，增进社员健康。去年春天，乐园公社周围一些地区先后发生过一种流行性传染病，而乐园公社由于实行了合作医疗，大家动手搞预防，采用了一些经济有效的办法，就没有发生这种流行性传染病。大家深深体会到，这是实行合作医疗、贯彻落实“预防为主”方针的结果。
    三、进一步发挥了广大贫下中农的阶级友爱精神，调动了社员的积极性，促进了社会主义卫生事业的发展。四大队第三生产队贫农社员郑定明有一次得了感冒，医生要给他开药，他连忙自己搞了点土方治好了。他说：“我一家六口，一年只交了六元钱，要是这样一点小病就开方吃药，把合作医疗的钱用过了头，别的阶级兄弟害了大病怎么办？我要听毛主席的话，毫不利己专门利人。”贫下中农自己掌管医疗卫生大权以后，处处表现出崇高的共产主义风格。刚开始实行合作医疗制度的时候，个别干部和医务人员不相信群众的觉悟，担心这样会“吃药看病钱不花，药铺大门要挤垮，医生腿子要跑断，拿着处方没药抓。”将近两年来的医疗实践，证明他们的担心是完全不符合事实的。去年今年的合作医疗费都有节余。贫下中农人人关心合作医疗，个个爱护合作医疗，社会主义的卫生事业越来越巩固。
    四、防止了资产阶级思想泛滥，加速了医务人员思想革命化和工作革命化。过去送医送药挂在嘴巴上，现在药器药箱背在肩膀上；过去为工资行医，现在为革命行医。他们在贫下中农不断的再教育下，以白求恩同志为榜样，真正做到了全心全意为贫下中农服务。共产党员、三大队医生覃祥官，过去只读过三年小学，贫下中农送他到县里举办的中医进修班学习了一年，在工作上几年如一日，忠心耿耿为人民。特别是通过活学活用毛主席著作，思想觉悟大为提高。在实行合作医疗以后，他不分日夜，翻山越岭，忙于出诊，和贫下中农心贴心，贫下中农称赞他是“白求恩式的好医生。”四大队第一生产队贫农社员郭永新的小孩，今年春节得了重病，三个医生守着看，终于把小孩抢救脱险。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在贫下中农的亲切关怀和再教育下，乐园公社卫生所一支深受贫下中农欢迎的革命医疗队伍正在茁壮成长。
