	Students of San Francisco City College bravely resist and win support from widespread students
	American students' struggle against persecution further expands
	Six thousand Mexican students protest again against fascist atrocities of the authorities

	BEIJING, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- Washington: The struggle of students at San Francisco State College in California against racial discrimination, against a corrupt educational system, and against the persecution of students is spreading to other schools. This situation has forced the reactionary school administration to once again announce a suspension of classes, thereby declaring the complete failure of the reactionary administration's plot to use force to compel students to attend classes.

	Students at San Francisco State College continued their fierce struggle with the three hundred police who were strutting around the campus on the 13th. Meanwhile, some students at San Mateo College near San Francisco held class boycotts and demonstrations on the 12th and 13th to support the just struggle of the students at San Francisco State College. On the 13th, some students at San Mateo College also stormed five buildings on the campus. The reactionary ruling clique of the United States hurriedly dispatched a large number of police to suppress the situation. Under these circumstances, the reactionary administration of San Francisco State College was forced to announce a suspension of classes again.

	Students at San Francisco State College have been on strike since November 6 to oppose racial discrimination and a corrupt educational system, and forced the administration to announce a suspension of classes on November 13. The reactionary administration of this college, starting on December 2, used a large number of police to carry out large-scale arrests and brutal suppression of the striking students, attempting to use force to compel classes to resume and sabotage the students' struggle. However, the black and white students of this college, closely united, have been fighting with the fascist police for nearly two weeks, finally smashing the reactionary administration's plot and forcing the administration to announce a suspension of classes again. Currently, the students of this college are continuing their struggle for a complete victory.

	In addition, on the 13th, black students at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, also held demonstrations against racial discrimination.

	MEXICO CITY, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- About six thousand students in Mexico City held a rally and demonstration on the 13th to protest the bloody suppression of the student movement by the authorities and to demand the release of all students who have been unjustly arrested.

	The students first held a rally in the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and then took to the streets for a demonstration. The Mexican authorities, frightened by the student movement, hastily dispatched several thousand fully armed reactionary troops and "riot police," with the support of tanks and paratroopers, to surround the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the National Polytechnic Institute, attempting to prevent the students' demonstration. However, the students fearlessly broke through the military and police blockade. They shouted slogans against the suppression and yelled "murderers!" at the reactionary troops. The savage reactionary troops and "riot police" arrested about five hundred students on the streets. The atrocities of the reactionary police enraged the people on the streets, who continuously booed these reactionaries.

	Since late July, students in the capital and other cities of Mexico have been engaged in a mass struggle for more than four months to protest the atrocities of the "riot police" in suppressing the student movement. To extinguish the flames of the student struggle, the Mexican authorities have on the one hand carried out bloody suppression of the students, and on the other hand used so-called "dialogue" and "negotiations" to sap the students' fighting spirit. However, all this has not been able to stop the development of the Mexican student struggle.

    旧金山学院学生英勇不屈的斗争赢得广大学生支持
    美国学生反迫害斗争进一步扩大
    墨西哥六千学生再次示威抗议当局法西斯暴行
    新华社十四日讯　华盛顿消息：美国加利福尼亚州州立旧金山学院学生反对种族歧视、反对腐朽的教育制度、反对迫害学生的斗争，正在向其他学校蔓延。这种情况迫使反动的院方再次被迫宣布停课，从而宣告了反动院方想用武力强迫学生开课的阴谋的彻底破产。
    州立旧金山学院的学生，十三日继续同在校园内耀武扬威的三百名警察展开激烈的搏斗。与此同时，旧金山市附近的圣马特奥学院的部分学生，十二日、十三日接连举行罢课和示威，支持州立旧金山学院学生的正义斗争。十三日，圣马特奥学院的部分学生还向这个学院的五座大楼进行冲击，美国反动统治集团急急忙忙抽调大批警察前去镇压。在这种情况下，州立旧金山学院的反动院方不得不再次宣布停课。
    州立旧金山学院的学生为了反对种族歧视和腐朽的教育制度，从十一月六日起就开始罢课，并于十一月十三日迫使院方宣布停课。这个学院的反动院方在十二月二日起使用大批警察对罢课学生进行大规模的逮捕和残酷的镇压，企图用武力强迫开课，破坏学生的斗争。但是这个学院的黑人和白人学生，紧密团结，连续和法西斯警察搏斗了将近两个星期，终于粉碎了反动院方的阴谋，迫使院方再次宣布停课。目前这个学院的学生正在为争取彻底胜利而继续斗争中。
    此外，十三日在纽约州伊萨卡的科奈尔大学和马萨诸塞州坎布里奇的哈佛大学也爆发了黑人学生反对种族歧视的示威。
    新华社十四日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥首都墨西哥城大约六千名学生十三日再次举行集会和示威游行，抗议当局对学生运动的血腥镇压，坚决要求当局释放所有被无理逮捕的学生。
    学生们首先在国立墨西哥大学校园内举行集会，然后走上街头举行示威游行。被学生运动吓破了胆的墨西哥当局，慌忙派出数千名全副武装的反动军队和“防暴队”，在坦克、伞兵部队的配合下，包围了国立墨西哥大学和国立工学院，妄图阻止学生的示威行动。但是，学生们毫不畏惧，勇敢地冲出军警的包围，他们高呼反对镇压暴行的口号，并朝着反动军队高喊“杀人凶手！”残暴的反动军队和“防暴队”竟在大街上大肆逮捕学生，大约有五百人被捕。反动军警的这一暴行激起街道上的群众的强烈愤慨，他们不断向这些反动派发出嘘声。
    七月底以来，墨西哥首都和其他城市的学生为抗议“防暴队”镇压学生运动的暴行，展开了持续四个多月的群众性斗争。为了扑灭学生斗争的烈火，墨西哥当局一方面对学生进行血腥镇压，另一方面又用所谓“对话”和
  “谈判”来麻痹学生的斗志，但是，这一切都阻挡不了墨西哥学生斗争浪潮的发展。
