Inspired by the great encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province, having achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, are now launching a mass movement to build farmland water conservancy projects to promote faster development in agricultural production.

This year, Anhui Province's task of earth and stone excavation for farmland water conservancy projects has reached over ten billion cubic meters, making it the year with the largest task in recent years. Currently, from the Huaihe Plain to the southern Anhui mountains, from the Dabie Mountains to the Huai River basin, more than 1.6 million peasants in various places have joined the battle to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects such as digging wells, excavating ponds, building dikes, digging rivers, opening canals, and constructing terraced fields. The entire construction site is bustling with activity.

Guided by Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing proletarian politics is a prominent feature of Anhui Province's farmland water conservancy construction this winter. Before entering the construction site and after arriving at the site, the broad masses of peasants have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's instructions on water conservancy work and the Party's relevant policies. They have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi promoted in water conservancy construction. Through study, the broad masses of peasants have deeply realized that how well the water conservancy battle is fought this winter and next spring is related to the issue of fully implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." Therefore, everyone is determined to build this year's farmland water conservancy projects with an unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary committees of some districts and communes in Suzhou, Anqing, and other regions have moved to the construction site to work, leading the peasants to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution while constructing water conservancy projects, integrating revolutionary criticism, class struggle, and party rectification with water conservancy construction. The peasants, armed with the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have summarized the brilliant achievements in water conservancy construction under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and are determined to carry forward the Dazhai spirit, self-reliance, and hard struggle to build water conservancy projects. Some communes and production teams responsible for the annual maintenance of the Yangtze River and Huai River dikes not only complete the earthwork task without a penny from the state but also solve the problem of some construction materials without asking the state for help.

This winter, Anhui Province's water conservancy construction is mostly small-scale farmland water conservancy projects that are self-financed by communes and production teams, can be completed and benefit within the same year. For example, in the Anqing region, many communes and production teams have small reservoirs and key projects. Within the scope of the nationally famous large-scale water conservancy irrigation project, the Shuxi-Hang Canal Irrigation District in Shouxian County, some communes and production teams are systematically excavating canals to ensure that the supporting projects reach the fields. At the foot of Jiuhua Mountain in Qingyang County, some communes and production teams, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "seeking perfection," are excavating small reservoirs on the basis of existing water conservancy projects to ensure that every acre of land can contribute more to socialist construction.

Currently, the number of peasants going to the construction sites in various places in Anhui Province is increasing, and a greater wave of water conservancy construction is forming across the province.

    发扬大寨精神　自力更生艰苦奋斗　促使农业更大发展
    安徽掀起群众性兴修水利高潮
    据新华社合肥电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，安徽省广大贫下中农在取得今年农业生产大丰收的基础上，为促使农业生产更快的发展，正在掀起一个群众性的大兴农田水利的高潮。
    今年安徽省兴修农田水利的土石方任务达十亿多立方，是近几年来任务最大的一年。目前，从淮北平原到皖南山区，从大别山到滁河流域，各地农村已有一百六十多万民工，投入了打井、挖塘、筑堤、挖河、开渠、修台田条田等兴修小型农田水利的战斗。整个工地呈现着一派紧张而繁忙的景象。
    以毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，是安徽省今冬兴修农田水利的一个突出的特点。广大民工进工地前和来到工地后，都参加了以学习毛主席关于水利工作的指示和党的有关政策为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在水利建设上推行的反革命修正主义路线。通过学习，广大民工深刻认识到，今冬明春的水利仗打得如何，是关系到全面落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大方针的问题。因此，大家决心以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心搞好今年的农田水利工程建设。宿县、池州、安庆等专区的一些区、社的革命委员会，还搬到工地工作，领导民工边施工，边开展无产阶级文化大革命运动，把革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党建党等项工作与兴修水利工作结合起来进行。民工们以党的十二中全会公报为武器，总结了在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，水利建设所取得的辉煌成就，决心发扬大寨精神，自力更生、艰苦奋斗兴修水利。一些负担长江、淮河大堤岁修任务的社队，不但完成土方任务不要国家一分钱，对一些施工用的物资，也不向国家伸手，自力更生地加以解决。
    安徽省今冬兴修水利，绝大部分是社队自己集资，当年兴修、当年就能受益的小型农田水利工程。如安庆地区很多公社队队有小水库，有骨干工程。在全国著名的大型水利灌溉工程淠史杭灌区范围内的寿县，一些社队都在有计划地开挖渠道，做到配套工程到田间。九华山脚下的青阳县，有些社队按照毛主席“精益求精”的教导，为了使每一亩土地都能为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献，在原有的水利工程基础上，大挖小型蓄水塘，保证每一亩田都能受益。
    目前，安徽省各地开赴工地的民工，不断增加，一个更大的兴修水利的高潮，正在全省各地形成。
