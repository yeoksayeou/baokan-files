After public primary schools were transferred to the management of production brigades, how should political and ideological work among teachers be carried out?

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongzhuangzi Commune in Huailai County are enthusiastically helping teachers to actively participate in class struggle and production labor, changing the previous situation of being "detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Now, many teachers have become "new commune members" who can both teach and work.

Editor's Note: In rural areas, some regions have already transferred public primary schools to the management of production brigades, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have completely taken control of the management of rural primary schools. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and a major achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The key to educational reform lies in the teachers." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongzhuangzi Commune, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have, after the transfer of public primary schools to the production brigades, combined with the specific situation of the schools, launched a thorough criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. They have enthusiastically armed the teachers with Mao Zedong Thought, helping them to change their old ideas, and have achieved good results. The experience of Dongzhuangzi Commune is worth emulating by other places.

News Report: After public primary schools were transferred to the management of production brigades, how should political and ideological work among the original public primary school teachers be carried out? The Revolutionary Committee of Dongzhuangzi Commune in Huailai County, Hebei Province, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "The key to educational reform lies in the teachers," with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support personnel, relying on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with deep proletarian feelings, enthusiastically helped the original public primary school teachers to raise their political consciousness, cultivate their spirit of self-revolution, and inspire teachers to consciously engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, sparking a revolution in their souls and thoroughly changing their old ideas.

Purifying the Poison of Revisionism, Walking the Path of Unity with Workers and Peasants

Dongzhuangzi Commune is located in a remote mountainous area at the foot of the ancient Great Wall. This year in October, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "Poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools," the commune transferred its eight public primary schools to the management of production brigades, with the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools. Revolutionary teachers enthusiastically supported this revolutionary measure and happily joined the educational revolution. However, some teachers, due to the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, had insufficient understanding of the significance of transferring public primary schools to the management of production brigades. Some said, "After studying for ten years under the cold lamp, I never expected to become a 'commune member' in a mountain valley." Others thought that being a teacher in a brigade-run school was not honorable, and so on. Facing this situation, the Revolutionary Committee of the commune, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support personnel, organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class attended by representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, leaders of various production brigades, all teachers, and representatives of the Red Guards. They mobilized everyone to take the class struggle between the two lines as the key, fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist "theory of reading books to become officials" and "theory of merging public and private interests," helping teachers to deeply excavate the roots of their ideas of looking down on workers and peasants and labor, raising their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. Young teacher Lu Zhongmei of the original public primary school, after being transferred to the production brigade, thought that it was not honorable to be a "commune member" in this "rocky, sparsely populated" poor mountain valley. In the study class, she, through her denunciation and criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, deeply realized that although she was the daughter of a poor peasant, under the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, she had more of the bourgeois idea of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others," and fewer of the excellent qualities of the working people. She angrily said, "This is all the poisoning of the bourgeois educational line, this is all the crime of the great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi. I will definitely break with Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line." From then on, Lu Zhongmei, following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, resolutely took the bright path of unity with workers and peasants, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, sincerely accepted re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly transformed her worldview. Now she is determined to be an ordinary laborer in the mountain valley for life, fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life. With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, many teachers have changed their previous "three detachments" lifestyle. They are commune members when they go to work and teachers when they go to class, becoming "new commune members" who can both teach and work.

Actively Promoting the Ideological Revolutionization of Teachers

After public primary schools were transferred to the management of production brigades, teachers' wages were changed to work points, and some teachers felt they were at a disadvantage. Some even quarreled endlessly over welfare benefits. The Revolutionary Committee of Dongzhuangzi Commune and the People's Liberation Army's support personnel believed that this was a struggle between public and private interests. Only by arming the teachers with Mao Zedong Thought, making them consciously use the "public" to overcome the "private," could they be cultivated into revolutionary teachers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, they organized teachers to discuss the issue of "Is it for the poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp the power of education, or is it for money?" In the discussion, they guided the teachers to bring their problems to the study of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's writings on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, to find problems in the struggle between the two lines, to find the cause in the depths of their souls, to thoroughly expose their private thoughts, and to fiercely criticize them. Through the study, the broad masses of teachers realized that whether to act from the interests of the people or to focus on "money" is a major issue of standing on which side in the struggle between the two classes and two lines. Teacher Sun Baolan, who had just graduated from a normal school, started to calculate after hearing that wages were changed to work points. After listening to the reports of old poor peasants and military leaders, her mind became clear, and she said at the meeting, "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people and exchanged them for the red political power of the proletariat. Today, in order to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end, is there any personal interest that we cannot sacrifice? Starting from the 'private' character, moving the abacus beads to the 'one person' side, the more you move, the farther you are from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; starting from the 'public' character, moving the abacus beads to the '300 million people' side, the more you move, the closer you are to Chairman Mao, the tighter you follow Chairman Mao."

At the same time, the Revolutionary Committee of the commune also repeatedly studied with the teachers Chairman Mao's instructions on "The more difficult the place, the more you should go, this is what a good comrade should do," helping the teachers to realize that "where there is hardship, settle down" or "where there is comfort, hide" is a reflection of two worldviews. Therefore, teachers actively signed up to go to the most difficult production brigades to settle down and do a good job for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Warmly and Patiently Re-educating Teachers

After the poor and lower-middle peasants directly managed the schools, they paid great attention to re-educating the teachers. Their approach was to regularly hold meetings of poor and lower-middle peasants from the production brigades, evaluate the teachers, point out their strengths and weaknesses, and based on the existing problems, use Chairman Mao's works as textbooks, use revolutionary criticism as motivation, use various activities of the production brigades as classrooms, and use poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers to warmly re-educate them. The poor and lower-middle peasants, on the one hand, allocated production bases to the schools, allowing the teachers to participate in labor, and on the other hand, also arranged for them to regularly return to the brigades to participate in labor, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, and to engage in struggles against the enemy. The poor and lower-middle peasants also often gave the teachers class education on class struggle, organized them to participate in the class struggle and class education activities of the production teams, and let them be tempered in the storm of class struggle.

To better carry out the mass re-education of the teachers, the poor and lower-middle peasants also widely carried out "one helps one" and "one red pair" activities with the teachers, helping the teachers to purge the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, accelerate the transformation of their worldviews, and become teachers of the Mao Zedong era. Old poor peasant Gao Qixi of Yaohe River Brigade found that teacher Yang Youzhen had the idea of fearing dirt in production labor, so he often talked to Yang Youzhen, recalling their bitter family history together, and pointed out to her, "A knife not sharpened will rust, a person not working will become revisionist. Only by having one heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants can you cultivate good successors for the poor and lower-middle peasants." Yang Youzhen's mind became clear after listening, and she hated Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line even more. She sincerely said to Gao Qixi, "I am determined to shed a layer of skin, roll in a layer of mud, transform my worldview, and revolutionize for life." After that, she participated in the brigade's production labor without fearing dirt or fatigue and also collected firewood and cut grass for the collective.

Helping Teachers Solve Practical Problems

The Revolutionary Committee of the commune, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "All these problems in the life of the masses should be put on our agenda. They should be discussed, decided, implemented, and checked," often actively understood the practical difficulties of the teachers, starting from reality, and made proper arrangements for the teachers' work points, rations, leave, medical care, maternity leave, and other issues. When the production brigade distributed grain and vegetables, they thought of the teachers. In one production brigade, the teachers used to have to travel thirty miles to buy vegetables, but this time, when the brigade distributed vegetables, the poor and lower-middle peasants sent people to deliver the vegetables to the teachers' hands.

While strengthening political and ideological leadership, the Revolutionary Committee of Dongzhuangzi Commune actively helped the teachers solve the problems they encountered in their actual work, promoting the teachers' awareness of accepting re-education and quickly realizing ideological revolutionization.

    公办小学下放大队以后，怎样做好教师的政治思想工作？
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装教师的头脑
    怀来县董庄子公社贫下中农满腔热情地帮助教师积极参加阶级斗争和生产劳动，改变过去“三脱离”的状况。现在，许多教师成为能教学能劳动的“新社员”
    编者按：在农村，已经有一些地区把公办小学下放到大队来办，广大贫下中农完全掌握了农村小学的管理大权。这是毛主席无产阶级教育路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大成绩。
    毛主席教导我们说：“教改的问题，主要是教员问题。”董庄子公社贫下中农遵照毛主席的这一教导，在公办小学下放到大队以后，结合学校的具体情况，展开了对刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的大批判，满腔热情地用毛泽东思想武装教师的头脑，帮助他们改变旧思想，收到了很好的效果。董庄子公社的经验值得各地参考。
    本报讯　公办小学下放到大队办以后，怎样做好原公办小学教师的政治思想工作？河北省怀来县董庄子公社革委会，遵照毛主席关于“教改的问题，主要是教员问题”的教导，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，依靠广大贫下中农，带着深厚的无产阶级感情，满腔热情地帮助原公办小学教师提高政治觉悟，培养自我革命精神，启发教师自觉地斗私批修，在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改变旧思想。
  肃清修正主义流毒，走与工农结合的路
    董庄子公社位于塞外古长城脚下的偏僻山区。今年十月，这个公社遵照毛主席“贫下中农管理学校”的教导，把所属八个公办小学下放到大队去办，由贫下中农管理学校。广大革命教师非常拥护这个革命措施，高高兴兴地投入了教育革命。但是还有一些教师由于受了修正主义教育路线的毒害，对公办小学下放到大队办的意义认识不足，有的说：“寒窗苦读十年书，想不到当了个山沟里的‘社员’。”有的认为当队办小学教员不光彩，等等。针对这种情况，公社革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，举办了有贫下中农代表、各大队领导班子的负责人、全体教师和红卫兵代表参加的毛泽东思想学习班，发动大家以两条路线斗争为纲，狠批刘少奇反革命修正主义的“读书做官论”和“公私溶化论”，帮助教师深挖轻视工农、轻视劳动的思想根源，提高了他们的两条路线斗争觉悟。原公办小学青年教师卢忠梅下放到大队以后，认为自己在这“多见石头少见人”的穷山沟当社员不光彩。在学习班里，她通过对刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的控诉和批判，深刻地认识到，自己虽是贫农的女儿，可是，在修正主义教育路线毒害下，“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的资产阶级思想多了，劳动人民的优秀品质少了。她愤怒地说：“这都是资产阶级教育路线的毒害，这都是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的罪行，我一定与刘少奇的修正主义教育路线彻底决裂。”从此，卢忠梅按照毛主席指引的方向，坚决走与工农相结合的光明大道，活学活用毛主席著作，诚诚恳恳地接受贫下中农再教育，彻底改造世界观。现在她决心在山沟里当一辈子普通劳动者，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线战斗一辈子。在贫下中农的帮助下，许多教员改变了过去那种“三脱离”生活，上工是社员，上课是教员，成为能教学能劳动的“新社员”。
        积极促进教师的思想革命化
    公办小学下放到大队办，教师工资改为记工分，有些教师认为吃了亏，有的还围绕福利待遇问题纠缠不休。董庄子公社革委会和解放军支左人员认为，这是一场公与私的斗争，只有用毛泽东思想武装教师的头脑，使他们自觉地用“公”字打倒“私”字，才能把他们培养成为无限忠于毛主席的革命教师。在毛泽东思想学习班上，便组织教师围绕“是为贫下中农掌好教育大权，还是为钱？”这个问题展开讨论。在讨论中，引导教师带着问题活学活用“老三篇”和毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命、巩固无产阶级专政的论述，在两条路线斗争中找问题，在灵魂深处找原因，彻底地亮私，狠狠地斗私。通过学习，广大教师认识到是从人民的利益出发，还是着眼于“钱”，这是在两个阶级、两条路线斗争中站在那一边的大问题。刚从师范学校毕业的教师孙宝兰，听到由工资改变为记工分后，心里就打起了“小算盘”。听了老贫农和部队首长的报告后，心里豁然开朗了，她在会上说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益，牺牲了自己的生命，换来了无产阶级的红色政权。今天为了把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲吗？从‘私’字出发，把算盘珠拨在‘一口观’上，越拨弄，离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越远；从‘公’字出发，把算盘珠拨在‘三十亿人民’这个数字上，越拨，离毛主席越近，跟毛主席越紧。”
    同时，公社革委会还和教员一起反复学习了毛主席关于“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，帮助教师认识到：“哪里艰苦哪里安家”还是“哪里舒服哪里躲”，是两种世界观的反映。因此，教师积极报名要求到最艰苦的大队去安家落户，为贫下中农办好学。
      热情耐心地对教师进行再教育
    这个公社的贫下中农直接管理学校后，很重视对教师进行再教育。他们的做法是：定期召开大队贫下中农会议，对教师做出鉴定，给他们指出优点和存在的问题。并针对存在的问题，以毛主席著作为教材，以革命大批判为动力，以生产大队各种活动为课堂，以贫下中农为老师，热情地对他们进行再教育。贫下中农一方面给学校拨出生产基地，让教师参加劳动，同时还让他们定期回队参加劳动，同广大贫下中农一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起开展对敌斗争。贫下中农还经常给教师上阶级教育课，组织他们参加生产队的阶级斗争和阶级教育活动，让他们在阶级斗争的风口浪头中受锻炼。
    为了更好地对教师进行群众性的再教育，贫下中农还与教师之间广泛开展“一帮一”“一对红”活动，帮助教师肃清反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒，加速世界观的改造，使他们成为毛泽东时代的教师。姚家河大队老贫农高起发现教师杨有珍在生产劳动中有怕脏思想，就多次找杨有珍谈心，一起回忆苦难家史，并给她指出：“刀不磨要生锈，人不劳动要变修，只有同贫下中农一个心眼，才能为贫下中农培养出好后代。”杨有珍听了后心里亮堂了，更加痛恨刘少奇的修正主义教育路线，她恳切地对高起说：“我决心脱一层皮，滚一身泥，改造世界观，革命一辈子。”以后她参加队里生产劳动时，不怕脏，不怕累，并为集体打柴、割草。
        帮助教师解决一些实际问题
    公社革委会同广大贫下中农一起，遵照毛主席关于“一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。应该讨论，应该决定，应该实行，应该检查”的教导，经常主动了解教师的实际困难，从实际出发，对教师的工分、口粮、休假、医疗、产假等问题，都作了妥善安排。大队进行粮食、蔬菜分配时，就想到了教师，有一个大队的教师过去吃蔬菜还得跑三十里山路去买，这次队里分菜时，贫下中农就派人把菜送到了教师的手里。
    董庄子公社革委会在切实加强政治思想领导的同时，对教师在实际工作中遇到的问题，给予积极帮助解决，促进了教师接受再教育的自觉性，尽快实现思想革命化。
