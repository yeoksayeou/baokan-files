Chairman Mao taught us at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: “We must learn to wage political, economic, and cultural struggles against the imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in the cities, and to wage diplomatic struggles against the imperialists. We must learn to wage both open and covert struggles against them. If we do not pay attention to these problems, do not learn to wage these struggles against them, and do not achieve victory in these struggles, we will not be able to maintain our power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail.” The practice of class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-road struggle over the past decade fully proves that Chairman Mao’s great directive is an unshakable truth.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we overthrew the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents, seized back some of the power they had usurped, and established revolutionary committees at various levels. However, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has not ended and will continue for a long time. This is because the old forces are not willing to easily withdraw from the historical stage. They will always try every means to surround and attack the new power. Therefore, the newly born red power can only consolidate and develop itself through continuous struggle against the old forces.

Early this year, we went to a certain unit to carry out the task of supporting the left. Together with the revolutionary cadres of that unit, we exposed the traitors, spies, and capitalist roaders one by one, seized back some of the power they had usurped, and established a revolutionary committee. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, we mistakenly thought that as long as we focused on work, everything would be fine. Consequently, we relaxed our class struggle and neglected the continuous transformation of old ideas and forces. Later, some class enemies became active again, and old ideas and forces resurfaced. At this point, we studied Chairman Mao’s teachings on class struggle again, realizing that the establishment of the revolutionary committee was only the “first step of the Long March.” We must use the power of the proletarian dictatorship to continuously suppress old ideas and forces. From then on, we focused on class struggle, carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and mobilized the masses to conduct one sweep after another against old ideas and forces, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee.

We deeply feel that with the birth of the revolutionary committee, the bourgeoisie and their agents have lost their past ruling positions, but they are not willing to accept it. They will continue to struggle with us in new forms, and the struggle will be more hidden and cunning. Therefore, the struggle is not relaxed but more arduous and in-depth. The struggle between the new and the old will never stop; this is the law of class struggle. The new will definitely defeat the old, and the proletariat will definitely defeat the bourgeoisie. This is an objective law that does not change with people’s will. The proletarian dictatorship will definitely be consolidated and developed through struggle. The key lies in the word “struggle.” As long as we remember Chairman Mao’s teaching of “never forgetting class struggle,” continuously raise our awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle, and firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we can struggle for a new world that is red with Mao Zedong Thought.

    无产阶级政权要在斗争中巩固发展
    副班长　胡继训
    毛主席在七届二中全会上教导我们：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，并向帝国主义者作外交斗争。既要学会同他们作公开的斗争，又要学会同他们作荫蔽的斗争。如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。”十几年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争实践充分证明：毛主席的这一伟大指示，是一条颠扑不破的真理。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们打倒了大叛徒刘少奇和他的代理人，夺回了被他们篡夺的一部分权力，成立了各级革命委员会，但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束，还将长期存在下去。这是因为，旧的势力是不肯轻易地退出历史舞台的。它们总要千方百计地对新的政权实行包围和进攻。为此，新生的红色政权只有通过不断地与旧的势力进行斗争，才能不断地巩固和发展。
    今年年初，我们到某单位执行支左任务。我们和那个单位的无产阶级革命派一起，把那些叛徒、特务、走资派一个个都揪了出来，一举夺回了被他们篡夺的一部分权力，建立了革命委员会。革委会建立后，我们误认为，只要抓好业务就行了，因而放松了阶级斗争，放松了对旧思想、旧势力的不断改造。后来，有的阶级敌人又活动起来，旧思想、旧势力又泛滥起来。这时，我们就再学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，认识到：革委会的建立，仅仅是“万里长征走完了第一步”，我们要用无产阶级专政的威力不断地去讨伐旧思想、旧势力。从此，我们狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，发动群众对那些旧思想、旧势力进行一次次的大扫荡，使革委会得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    我们深深体会到：随着革委会的诞生，资产阶级及其代理人失去了过去的统治地位，但是，他们是决不甘心的。他们还会以新的形式和我们斗争，而且会更隐蔽更巧妙，所以，斗争不是轻松了，而是更艰苦，更深入了。新与旧的斗争永远不会停息，这是阶级斗争的规律。新的一定能够战胜旧的，无产阶级一定能战胜资产阶级，这是一个不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。无产阶级的政权一定能在斗争中巩固和发展。关键就在一个“斗”字上。只要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，狠狠抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，就能斗出一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。
