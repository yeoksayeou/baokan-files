I suggest that the middle schools (including high schools) in county towns should be appropriately adjusted, with some of them relocated to communes and managed by the commune revolutionary committees. I believe this approach has several advantages:

First, it will put an end to the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational system where the regional education bureau leads key schools, and key schools lead other schools. This will allow schools to operate directly under the leadership of the commune revolutionary committees, facilitating the management of schools by poor and lower-middle peasants.

Second, it will be beneficial for the ideological transformation of intellectuals. With the county town schools managed by communes, communes can tailor their educational practices to local conditions and needs. For example, during busy farming seasons, schools can close for vacations, and teachers and students can participate in agricultural production. This not only meets the needs of agricultural production but also allows teachers and students to be tempered through labor.

Third, it will help more children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enroll in schools, promoting the universalization of secondary education, and ensuring that students do not detach from labor while studying. Currently, most rural students have to travel tens of miles to county towns to attend middle school, which separates them from their families, labor, and the poor and lower-middle peasants. After the communes take over the management of schools, children of poor and lower-middle peasants can attend school nearby.

Fourth, in the past, students from county town schools often became arrogant after studying, looking down on poor and lower-middle peasants, and even disrespecting their own parents. After relocating middle schools to communes, students can return home daily to participate in a certain amount of labor, which can help them maintain their emotional connection with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

After relocating county town schools to communes, several specific issues need to be addressed:

First, teachers should be allocated according to the needs of each commune, coordinated by the county revolutionary committee.

Second, the issue of teachers' salaries and rations. All middle school teachers' salaries will continue to be paid by the state, and their rations will continue to be supplied by the state. However, the original large salary gaps need to be adjusted.

### 县城公办中学应由公社来办

    县城公办中学应由公社来办
    我建议将县城里的中学（包括高中）要适当调整，有的可以分散到公社，由公社革命委员会领导。我认为这样做的好处是：
    一、结束了专区文教局领导重点中学，重点中学领导各中学的反革命修正主义教育体制，使学校直接在公社革命委员会领导下进行工作，有利于贫下中农管理学校。
    二、有利于知识分子的思想改造。县城中学由公社办，公社可以因时因地制宜办学，例如农忙时放假，组织师生参加农业生产劳动，既可以适应农业生产的需要，也可以使师生在生产劳动中经受锻炼。
    三、有利于更多地吸收贫下中农子女入学，普及中等教育，并做到读书不脱离劳动，毕业后能文能武。目前农村学生大多数要到十几里甚至几十里以外的县城读中学，使学生脱离家庭，脱离劳动，脱离贫下中农。由公社办学校后，贫下中农子女可以就近上学。
    四、过去县城里的中学生，读了书回家有些洋气，看不起贫下中农了，有的连自己的父母亲也看不起了。中学分散到公社办后，学生每天回家参加一定时间的劳动，可以避免失去贫下中农的思想感情。
    县城里的中学分散到公社后，有一些具体问题需要解决：
    一、教师应根据各公社需要，由县革命委员会统一调配。
    二、教师工资、口粮问题。所有中学教师工资仍由国家开支，口粮仍由国家供应。但原工资差距太大的需要改变。
