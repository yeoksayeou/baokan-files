The workers' and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Yinxian People's Anti-Epidemic Hospital, along with the hospital's revolutionary committee, have led the medical staff in studying Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the important editorial "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" published by the central newspapers and journals. This has raised the medical staff's awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They have actively participated in the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of the class ranks, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside."

After Chairman Mao's latest directive was issued and his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee was republished, the workers' and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Yinxian People's Anti-Epidemic Hospital, along with the hospital's revolutionary committee, immediately organized the medical staff to study them seriously. During the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the medical staff thoroughly recalled the history of the struggle between the two lines within the hospital, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi.

Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the medical staff further enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Under the leadership of the workers' and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the hospital's revolutionary committee, they waged a "people's war" to cleanse the class ranks, uncovering a counter-revolutionary element who had been hiding in the medical and health team for more than twenty years.

Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines and the launch of revolutionary criticism, the workers' and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the medical staff enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and raised their consciousness in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The members of the workers' propaganda team immediately divided into three groups to go to the countryside, understand the situation of the poor and lower-middle peasants re-educating the medical staff who have already settled down in the countryside, and conduct education on the struggle between the two lines for these medical staff, making them truly take root in the countryside. The doctors who originally stayed in the hospital, after studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, raised their awareness and actively requested to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants and serve them.
