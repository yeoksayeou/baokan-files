Title: The Disciples of Acheson

The recent anniversary of the signing of the "Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Postwar Cooperation" between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia has been used by the Soviet revisionist clique to loudly proclaim the so-called "Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship." This is a perfect example of self-mockery!

Today, Czechoslovakia is under the occupation of Soviet revisionist troops. This long-term military occupation has been formalized by the unequal treaty signed recently between the Soviet revisionists and the Czechoslovak revisionist leaders, known as the "Conditions for the Temporary Stationing of Soviet Troops in Czechoslovakia." Czechoslovakia has thus become a protectorate of the Soviet revisionists. What kind of "friendly cooperation" is this? Obviously, the so-called "friendship" from the mouths of the Soviet revisionists is nothing but a euphemism for aggression and enslavement.

To justify the development of the "friendly cooperation" relationship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the Soviet revisionist clique boasts about the increase in trade volume between the two countries. They gleefully boast about how much oil, grain, and other goods they have provided to Czechoslovakia. These accounts of exploitation are better left unsaid, but mentioning them only serves to highlight the ruthless methods of aggression employed by the Soviet revisionist clique. To take just one example, the price of oil that the Soviet Union sells to Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries is twice as high as the price they sell to Western European capitalist countries. In this way, the Soviet revisionists use unequal exchange to exploit Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries ruthlessly. If this is what they call "friendship," then what is economic plunder?

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in 1949, when commenting on the U.S. "White Paper," that the U.S. imperialists use the pretense of "friendship" to cover up the aggressive nature of their policy towards China, saying: "Acheson lies to your face, turning aggression into 'friendship.'" Now, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk also lie to your face, calling their aggression against Czechoslovakia "friendship." These shameless traitors, like the American imperialists, have always been full of sweet talk but do nothing but evil. They are nothing but disciples of Acheson.

"Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship" does exist, and it exists between the Soviet people and the Czechoslovak people. The Soviet revisionist clique is the common enemy of the people of both countries. This clique not only rides roughshod over the Czechoslovak people but also over the Soviet people. It is this clique that wantonly destroys the traditional friendship between the Soviet and Czechoslovak peoples. The Soviet people and the Czechoslovak people will surely join hands to fight together to overthrow this new tsarist clique.

    艾奇逊的门徒
    苏修叛徒集团最近借“苏捷友好互助和战后合作条约”签订二十五周年，大吹大擂所谓“苏捷友谊。”这真是一种绝妙的自我讽刺！
    今天的捷克斯洛伐克处在苏修侵略军队的占领之下，而且这种长期军事占领，由苏修和捷修头目不久以前签订的所谓“关于苏联军队暂时留驻捷克斯洛伐克境内的条件”的不平等条约固定了下来。捷克斯洛伐克已经沦为苏修的保护国。这算是一种什么样的“友好合作”关系呢？很显然，苏修叛徒嘴里的所谓“友谊”，不过是侵略和奴役的代名词。
    苏修集团为了要说明苏捷“友好合作”关系的发展，大谈苏捷两国贸易额的增长，而且津津乐道地吹嘘它给捷克斯洛伐克提供了多少多少石油，多少多少粮食和其他商品。这种剥削账，不提也罢，提起来只能使人更加看到苏修叛徒集团的社会帝国主义的侵略手段之狠毒。别的不说，就拿苏修卖给捷克斯洛伐克和其他东欧国家的石油来说，其价钱竟比它卖给西欧资本主义国家的要高一倍。苏修就是这样利用贵卖贱买的不等价交换，对捷克斯洛伐克等东欧国家进行着残酷的剥削。如果这也算是一种“友谊”的表示，试问什么才叫做经济掠夺呢？
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在一九四九年评论美国的“白皮书”时，曾经尖锐地揭露美帝国主义用所谓“友谊”掩盖其对华政策的侵略实质说：“艾奇逊当面撒谎，将侵略写成了‘友谊’。”现在，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流也是当面撒谎，把对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略说成是“友谊”。这一伙无耻的叛徒，同美帝国主义者一样，一向是好话说尽，坏事做绝的。他们不过是艾奇逊之流的门徒而已。
      “苏捷友好”是存在的，它存在于苏联人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民之间。而苏修叛徒集团正是苏捷两国人民的共同敌人。这个叛徒集团不仅骑在捷克斯洛伐克人民的头上横行霸道，而且骑在苏联人民头上作威作福。也就是这个叛徒集团，肆意破坏苏捷两国人民的传统友谊。苏联人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民，一定会紧密地携起手来，为打倒这伙新沙皇而共同奋斗。
