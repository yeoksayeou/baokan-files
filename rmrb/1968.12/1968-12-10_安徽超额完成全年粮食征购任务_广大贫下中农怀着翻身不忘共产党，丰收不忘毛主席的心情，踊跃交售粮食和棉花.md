The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province, who have achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture, are following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp grain, grasp cotton, and grasp cloth" and to "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." They are enthusiastically delivering grain and cotton to the state. By November 25, the province had exceeded its annual grain procurement target by 4.5 percent; the cotton procurement target had been completed by 83.3 percent. The procurement volumes of other agricultural and livestock products such as tobacco, hemp, oilseeds, pigs, poultry, eggs, and tea leaves have also increased significantly compared to the same period last year. Currently, the poor and lower-middle peasants and community members across the province are continuing to deliver large quantities of grain, cotton, and other agricultural and livestock products to the state.

This year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province have further promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, advancing the revolutionization of people's thinking. They have fought against nature, overcome various natural disasters, and achieved revolutionary and production victories. The hundreds of millions of heroic sons and daughters along the Huai River have overcome the severe floods, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Jianghuai hilly region have overcome the prolonged drought, achieving double victories in revolution and production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with the sentiment of "never forgetting the Communist Party for liberation" and "never forgetting Chairman Mao for the harvest," are enthusiastically delivering grain and cotton.

In the grain and cotton procurement work this year, Anhui Province has emphasized proletarian politics and focused on class struggle. They have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his local agents who promoted the "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "material incentives," as well as the "keep more, sell less" and "keep good, sell inferior" policies in procurement and unified purchase work. The revolutionary criticism has greatly enhanced the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, effectively promoting the procurement work.

After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, inspired by the communiqué, have further launched a high tide of delivering grain and cotton to the state. Counties along the Yangtze River such as Wuhu and Dangtu completed their annual grain procurement targets within ten days of the communiqué's publication. The entire Wuhu Prefecture completed the procurement of grain, cotton, and oil within fifteen days of the communiqué's publication.

    安徽超额完成全年粮食征购任务
    广大贫下中农怀着翻身不忘共产党，丰收不忘毛主席的心情，踊跃交售粮食和棉花
    据新华社合肥电　取得农业大丰收的安徽省广大贫下中农，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，踊跃向国家交售粮食和棉花。到十一月二十五日止，全省已超额百分之四点五完成了全年粮食征购任务；棉花征购任务已经完成百分之八十三点三，其他烟、麻、油料、猪、禽、蛋、茶叶等农畜产品的收购量与去年同期相比，也都有较大增长。目前，全省各地贫下中农和社员群众，正在继续不断地把大批粮食、棉花和其他农畜产品交售给国家。
    今年，安徽省广大贫下中农在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，进一步开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，促进了人的思想革命化。他们与天斗，与地斗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，战胜了各种自然灾害。淮河两岸的几百万英雄儿女，战胜了淮河的特大洪水，江淮丘陵地区的广大贫下中农战胜了持续数月的干旱，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。广大贫下中农怀着翻身不忘共产党，丰收不忘毛主席的心情，踊跃交售粮食和棉花。
    今年安徽省在粮棉征购工作中，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争。他们深入开展了革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和他在当地的代理人所推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”以及在征购、统购工作中推行的“多留少卖”、“留好卖次”等黑货。革命的大批判大大提高了贫下中农和社员群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了收购工作的开展。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，广大贫下中农在公报的鼓舞下，进一步掀起了向国家交售粮食和棉花的高潮。沿江的芜湖、当涂等县在公报发表后的十天内，就完成了全年粮食征购任务，整个芜湖专区在公报发表后十五天内就完成了粮、棉、油征购任务。
