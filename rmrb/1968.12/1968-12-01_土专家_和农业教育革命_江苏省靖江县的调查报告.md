**Editors of the Red Flag Magazine Note:** This article vividly depicts the affection of poor and lower-middle peasants for “local experts” and the methods of cultivating “local experts.” With poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools and each commune paying attention to cultivating a group of their own “local experts,” the children of poor and lower-middle peasants will no longer be “one year in the countryside, two years in the city, three years not recognizing their parents.”

“Local experts” are flowers that bloomed in the fierce struggle between the two lines. Many young “local experts” are good offspring of poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the praise given by the poor and lower-middle peasants of DaXing Commune in Dingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, to non-full-time agricultural technicians.

In 1958, under the guidance of Chairman Mao’s proletarian educational revolution thought, all brigades in DaXing Commune set up Red and Expert Schools. All students were native to the area, moving from brigade to brigade. They studied politics, culture, and learned from poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers, doing their homework in the fields. According to incomplete statistics at the time, the entire commune of 20 brigades cultivated more than 150 “local experts,” making significant contributions to the development of agricultural production.

Just as this team was thriving, Liu Shaoqi and his agents implemented a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines that believed in “foreign” but not “local,” advocating for “experts managing agriculture” and the fallacy that “uneducated people do not understand scientific research.” They cut off all Red and Expert Schools, attempting to strangle this new agricultural technology team in its cradle, causing the thriving agricultural technology team to suffer severe damage.

On May 9, 1963, our great leader Chairman Mao, in his comments on “Seven Good Materials on Cadres Participating in Labor from Zhejiang Province,” clearly pointed out: “Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation are the three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state.” Chairman Mao’s teachings pointed the way for mass scientific research. The entire commune responded enthusiastically, establishing mass scientific experiment networks from brigades to production teams. The “local experts” who had been suppressed by the revisionist line became active again. Over the years, they have developed significantly. Now, the commune has a commune-level agricultural technology station, brigades have 5 to 7 people, and production teams have 3 to 5 people in research groups. The entire commune has more than 800 agricultural technicians. This research army, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, has grown rapidly. After being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has become even stronger.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Welcome “Local Experts”

“Local experts” are mostly poor and lower-middle peasants who love Chairman Mao deeply, have rich practical experience, and are revolutionary. They do not leave labor, do not leave the masses, do not burden the masses, are both commune members and technicians, and are propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. Many are active promoters of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They have been warmly welcomed by poor and lower-middle peasants.

“Local experts” are heart-to-heart with poor and lower-middle peasants. They share the concerns and thoughts of poor and lower-middle peasants, farm for the revolution, and dedicate themselves to the revolution. In the summer of 1965, the cotton in Songbai Dike Production Team of Brigade 71 had just sprouted when it was infested with pests. In two or three days, 13 mu of cotton seedlings died, with 70% of them affected. The production team’s “local expert” saw that the collective economy was damaged, and the green cotton seedlings that poor and lower-middle peasants had painstakingly nurtured were dying in patches, making them very anxious. “Local expert” Xue Meifang was so upset that she cried. To find the root of the problem, she and a few other “local experts” spent several days squatting by the affected cotton seedlings, caring for them like sick relatives, observing the pest situation day and night, and finally found the cotton bollworm. They took the captured bollworm to the county agricultural technology station and the county agricultural bureau for consultation, but some technicians there dismissed it, saying, “The book does not mention this kind of insect,” and “Even if there is such an insect, it will not harm the cotton seedlings.” The “local experts” were so angry that they said, “We will do it ourselves and definitely exterminate the pests with the spirit of moving mountains.” Saving the seedlings is like putting out a fire. After repeated experiments, they used methods such as treating with 666 powder and attracting and killing with sugar acid, finally controlling the pests. The commune immediately promoted this method, saving more than 2,500 mu of affected cotton seedlings across the commune. Old poor peasant Gu Bingsheng excitedly said, “There are 360 trades, and each trade has its champion. Xue Meifang and her colleagues are our poor and lower-middle peasants’ ‘local champions.’”

From the comparison of two agricultural technology stations, it can be seen that the masses love “local experts” and dislike empty talkers who are knowledgeable but lack practical experience. One is the county agricultural technology station with good equipment and conditions, equipped with measuring tapes, sprayers, balances, and a large number of testing instruments. The other is the commune agricultural technology station with no equipment and no foreign books. In terms of division of labor, the two stations are different. The county station is like a street vendor, each doing their own thing. Those who manage cotton do not manage rice, and those who manage rice do not ask about cotton. The commune agricultural technology station manages everything, grasps everything, and there is no division of labor. The county agricultural technology station’s technicians go out with a measuring tape in hand, ride a bicycle, and measure and calculate wherever they go. The masses say they ride bicycles but solve few problems. The commune agricultural technology station’s “local experts” go out with Mao Zedong Thought, engage in the three great revolutionary movements, and work with bare feet in the fields. Wherever they go, they learn and do, using both their mouths and hands. This spring, during the rice seedling cultivation, the county agricultural technology station’s people pointed and talked in the fields, proposing various specifications and standards, and talked a lot but did not do anything. The poor and lower-middle peasants wanted them to set an example, but they were at a loss. The poor and lower-middle peasants said they were “talking about farming.” The commune’s “local experts” were different. They went barefoot into the fields, worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the seedling fields were done to standard. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, “‘Local experts’ say what they do, we understand their words, and we can learn their knowledge. ‘Local experts’ are the most practical and can solve problems.”

The technicians from the prefecture-level agricultural science institute also could not solve practical problems. In 1967, two technicians from this institute went to Brigade 71 to work. At that time, the masses had placed their hopes on them. However, they went around pointing and talking, running on the main roads, and rarely participated in labor. During the cotton flowering and boll setting, the cotton fields in Brigade 51 had poor soil, urgently needing fertilizer. They said that applying fertilizer would cause excessive growth and did not allow it, while the soil and plant conditions in Xue’s Production Team were the same. The “local experts” believed that applying this fertilizer was the key to ensuring early maturity, late decay, and high yield of cotton, so they immediately led the entire team, men and women, to apply manure and fertilizer. As a result, Xue’s Production Team produced 35 more pounds of cotton per mu than Brigade 51. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, “College students have fame but do not understand the temperament of crops. If we farm according to their methods, the yield will decrease. ‘Local experts’ are like us, understanding each other, talking in words and doing in actions, and setting a good example for us. We welcome such ‘local experts.’”

Cultivating and Improving “Local Experts” in the Three Great Revolutionary Movements

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: “The successors of the proletarian revolution must grow in great storms and tempests.”

The main methods of cultivating “local experts” in DaXing Commune are:

First, let “local experts” go to the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, to the storms of class struggle, and temper a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants of DaXing Commune place the improvement of the class consciousness of “local experts” and helping them establish the correct political viewpoint of farming for the revolution and researching agricultural science for the revolution in the first place. When Zhu Yufen, a “local expert” from the commune agricultural technology station, first participated in production after leaving school, she held “foreign books” and studied foreign doctrines, resulting in more confusion. The poor and lower-middle peasants earnestly told her, “You have studied for more than ten years, do not hold foreign books anymore, and should study Chairman Mao’s works and temper yourself in labor.” With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Zhu Yufen insisted on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and participating in collective production labor. In practice, she improved her class consciousness, consciously served the poor and lower-middle peasants, and became an active promoter of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought on the mass scientific research front in the county and prefecture. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders in the party stirred up anarchist winds, inciting some agricultural technicians in the commune agricultural technology station to leave their posts. Comrade Zhu Yufen saw through the class enemy’s plot to sabotage production at a glance, bravely took on the burden of the commune agricultural technology station, actively guided the agricultural scientific experiments of the entire commune, and made great contributions. After the establishment of the commune revolutionary committee, she was sent to the front line of the struggle against the enemy to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation of “difficult” units. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised such “local experts,” saying, “‘Local experts’ have dark faces and red hearts, and their technical power is excellent. Such technicians can truly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants.”

Second, come from the masses, go to the masses, connect theory with practice, let officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, and soldiers teach soldiers, and continuously improve the technical level of “local experts” in production struggle practice. The commune agricultural technology station has three comrades whose main task is to go to various brigades to work, help discover and cultivate typical examples, summarize experiences, and promote exchanges. Agricultural technicians in various brigades and production teams study several current production topics in each season. Last year, the “local experts” in Liu Xi Production Team of Yu Jin Brigade studied how to summerize and winterize duckweed, solving a problem that “foreign experts” could not solve. The commune immediately organized “local experts” to learn from Liu Xi Production Team, where the “local experts” were teachers, and the other agricultural technicians were students, with the riverbank as the classroom. All “local experts” in the commune learned this technology.

Third, combine the experiences of other places with the specific conditions of this place, conduct experiments and promote them. For example, in the steaming of sweet potato seedlings, some masses did not believe it at first. The “local experts” in Ju Jia Di and several technicians from the county agricultural technology station jointly studied and promoted the steaming furnace to produce three beds of seedlings, saving coal and labor. The entire commune quickly developed to 42 steaming furnaces. Chen Shande, a graduate of a technical school, said, “Practice is the most important. People like us who came from old schools can only make some contributions by combining with ‘local experts’ who have practical experience; otherwise, we will achieve nothing.”

Fourth, let “local experts” learn necessary agricultural technical theories, elevate their practical experience to the level of theory, and then guide production practice. The commune agricultural technology station regularly prints some scientific research materials related to agricultural technology for “local experts” to study and apply. Using a combination of regular and irregular methods to train “local experts,” some technicians from the county agricultural technology station who are good at combining with poor and lower-middle peasants teach agricultural theoretical knowledge. DaXing Commune adopts various training methods, holding 350 field on-site meetings, lectures, and operation meetings in four years, cultivating a group of technically and ideologically strong technical backbone forces. From 1964 to 1968, seven counties invited 38 “local experts” from DaXing Commune to help with technological innovation, deeply welcomed by the masses in various places.

From the Growth of “Local Experts,” See the Direction of Agricultural Education Revolution

1. The power of agricultural education and agricultural technology must be in the hands of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants. In the future, agricultural colleges must all be moved to the countryside and managed by poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, the power of agricultural colleges was in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, and harming many children of workers and peasants. This commune had a student who did everything at home but, after entering an agricultural college, was corrupted by bourgeois ideology, turning from a black-faced, red-hearted poor peasant’s son into a person who was alienated from the masses and reality. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, “After entering college, one year of study, one looks down on classmates who farm at home; two years of study, one does not recognize one’s parents; three years of study, one’s private thoughts soar. It is truly ‘misty sky releasing pigeons, gone without a trace.’” Therefore, only the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants can grasp the power of agricultural education, making education serve proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and cultivate a large number of new-type agricultural scientific and technological personnel who are both red and expert.

2. The admission objects of agricultural colleges should be selected from “local experts” who have red hearts, bright eyes, muddy feet, and calloused hands. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, “Such seedlings, if selected for study, we will be satisfied and at ease.” The teaching content should take class struggle as the main course, connect theory with practice, and connect with the specific conditions of agricultural production in various regions. The practical problems encountered by “local experts” on the front line should be brought to the school for research and theoretical improvement. After studying for one or two years in the school, they should return to production practice. The graduation certificates of students should be issued by the poor and lower-middle peasants after examination.

3. The original teaching staff must be thoroughly reformed, consisting of poor and lower-middle peasants with rich practical experience, “local experts,” and intellectuals who are good at combining with workers and peasants. Intellectuals must take the road of combining with workers and peasants, go to labor in batches, and be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old ideas.

    “土专家”和农业教育革命
    江苏省靖江县的调查报告
    《红旗》杂志编者按：这篇材料生动地描写了贫下中农热爱“土专家”的情形和培养“土专家”的途径。贫下中农管理学校，加上各个公社都注意培养一批自己的“土专家”，贫下中农子弟就不会“一年土，二年洋，三年不识爹和娘”了！
    “土专家”是在两条路线激烈斗争中开放出来的花朵，不少年青的“土专家”是贫下中农的好后代。这是江苏省靖江县大兴公社贫下中农对不脱产农业技术员的赞美称呼。
    一九五八年，大兴公社在毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想的指引下，全社各大队纷纷办起了红专学校。学员全部是土生土长，队来队去，他们学政治，学文化，拜贫下中农做老师，在田头做功课。据当时不完全的统计，全公社二十个大队共培养出“土专家”一百五十多人，对发展农业生产作出了很大的贡献。
    正当这支队伍蓬勃发展的时候，刘少奇及其代理人，推行了一整套信“洋”不信“土”的反革命修正主义路线，鼓吹“专家治农”，“大老粗”不懂科研的谬论，一刀砍掉全部红专学校，妄想把这支新生的农技队伍扼杀在摇篮之中，使茁壮成长的农业技术队伍遭到了摧残。
    一九六三年五月九日，我们伟大领袖毛主席在《浙江省七个关于干部参加劳动的好材料》的批语中，明确指出：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动”。毛主席的教导，为群众科学研究指明了方向，全公社闻风而动，从大队到生产队都设立了群众科学实验网。一时被修正主义路线整下去的“土专家”又重新活跃起来了。几年来获得了很大的发展。现在公社有社办农技站，大队有五到七人、生产队有三到五人的科研小组，全公社有八百多个农技员。这支科研大军，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，迅速成长起来。经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，变得更加坚强了。
      贫下中农最欢迎“土专家”
    “土专家”大都是无限热爱毛主席，并有着丰富实践经验、有革命干劲的贫下中农、革命干部和经过几年劳动锻炼的知识青年。他们不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，不加重群众负担，既是社员又是技术员，又是毛泽东思想宣传员。有不少是活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。他们受到了贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    “土专家”同贫下中农心连心。他们急贫下中农所急，想贫下中农所想，种田为革命，一心为革命。一九六五年夏天，七一大队松柏垡生产队的棉花刚出土不久，就遭到了虫害。在两三天内，有十三亩棉苗死去百分之七十。生产队的“土专家”看到集体经济受到损失，贫下中农辛勤培育的绿油油的棉苗成片死去，非常着急。“土专家”薛美芳急得哭了。为了找出病根，她和其他几个“土专家”一连几天蹲在受害的棉苗旁，象伺候生病的亲人一样，废寝忘食地观察虫害的情况，终于找到了危害棉苗的象鼻虫。他们拿着捉到的象鼻虫请教县农技站和县农业局，想不到有的技术员却不以为然地说：“书本上没有讲到这种虫子”，“就是有这种虫子，也不会危害棉苗。”“土专家”听了这些没有一点贫下中农感情的“洋专家”的话，肺都气炸了，他们坚定地说：“我们自己搞，一定要以愚公移山的精神，迅速扑灭虫害。”救苗如救火。他们经过反复试验，用六六粉治虫、糖酸诱杀等方法，终于制服了虫害。公社立即进行了推广，使全公社二千五百多亩受害的棉苗都脱了险。老贫农顾炳生激动地说：“三百六十行，行行出状元。薛美芳他们就是我们贫下中农的‘土状元’。”
    从两个农技站的对比中，也可以看出群众爱的是“土专家”，厌的是空话连篇、言之无物的知识分子。一个是设备条件好的县农技站，有皮尺、喷雾器、天平等一大堆测验仪器。一个是一无设备、二无“洋”本本的公社农技站。在分工上两个农技站各有不同。县站是敲锣卖糖，各管一行。管棉花的不管稻，管稻的不问棉花。公社农技站是样样管，行行抓，分工不分家。县农技站的一些技术员，出门手里拿着一根尺，骑上一部脚踏车，到一个地方就是测测，算算。群众说他们脚踏车骑骑，解决不了多大问题。公社农技站的“土专家”出门带的是毛泽东思想，搞的是三大革命，摆开两条泥腿子，深入田头，到一处就是学学、干干，动嘴又动手。今年春天水稻育秧时，县农技站的人在田头指手划脚，提出这个规格，那个标准，夸夸其谈讲了一大套，就是不动手，贫下中农要他们做个样子，他们傻了眼，贫下中农说他们是“嘴上种田”。公社“土专家”就不同，他们赤脚下田，同贫下中农一起干，秧田做得很合标准。贫下中农说：“‘土专家’说到做到，他们的话我们一听就懂，他们的学问，我们一学就会。‘土专家’最符合实际，最能解决问题。”
    专区农科所的一些技术员也同样解决不了实际问题。一九六七年，这个农科所有两个技术员到七一大队搞点，当时，群众曾经把希望寄托在他们身上。那知，他们一到，就是指手划脚，大路跑跑，田头转转，很少参加劳动。在棉花开花结铃时，五一生产队有四十亩棉花田田底差，急需追肥。他们说，追了要疯长，不让追，而薛家生产队同样的田底和苗情，“土专家”根据往年实践经验，认为追上这次肥是保证棉花早熟迟衰产量高的关键，因而立即带领全队男男女女浇粪追肥。结果，薛家生产队比五一生产队每亩增产皮棉三十五斤。贫下中农说：“大学生有名气，就是摸不到庄稼的脾气，照他们的方法种田，产量要降低。‘土专家’和我们是土对土，谈得拢，说在嘴上，做在手上，为我们做出了好样子。这样的‘土专家’我们就是欢迎。”
        在三大革命运动中培养和
  提高“土专家”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“无产阶级的革命接班人总是要在大风大浪中成长的。”
    大兴公社培养“土专家”的主要途径：
    一是放手让“土专家”到三大革命运动的实践中去，到阶级斗争的风浪中去，锻炼一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。大兴公社的贫下中农把提高“土专家”的无产阶级觉悟，帮助他们树立为革命种田、为革命研究农业科学的正确的政治观点，放在首要地位。公社农技站的“土专家”朱玉芬刚离开学校参加生产时，捧着“洋本本”，死啃洋教条，结果越学越糊涂。贫下中农语重心长地对她说：“你上了十几年学，不要再捧洋本本了，应该好好学习毛主席著作，到劳动中去锻炼自己。”朱玉芬在贫下中农的帮助下，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持参加集体生产劳动，在实践中提高了自己的政治觉悟，自觉地为贫下中农服务，成了县和专区群众科研战线上的活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资派刮起无政府主义妖风，煽动公社农技站的个别农技员离开工作岗位。朱玉芬同志一眼看穿了阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，勇敢地挑起了公社农技站的重担，积极指导全公社的农业科学实验，作出了很大贡献。公社革委会成立以后，又把朱玉芬同志放到对敌斗争第一线去，领导“老大难”单位的斗、批、改。贫下中农称赞这样的“土专家”说：“‘土专家’脸黑心红立场稳，技术大权掌得顶呱呱，这样的技术员才能真正为贫下中农服务。”
    二是从群众中来，到群众中去，理论联系实际，官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵，在生产斗争实践中不断提高“土专家”的技术水平。公社农技站有三个同志，主要任务是到各大队搞点，帮助发现典型，培养典型，总结经验，交流推广。各大队、生产队农技员在每一个季节里，都专门研究几个当前生产中的课题。去年跃进大队刘西生产队的几个“土专家”，对红萍如何越夏、冬保进行了研究，解决了“洋专家”不能解决的难题。公社立即组织“土专家”到刘西生产队取经，那里的“土专家”就是教师，其余农技员就是学生，河边就是课堂。全公社的“土专家”都学会了这个技术。
    三是将外地的经验，结合本地的具体情况，进行试验和推广。如搞山芋蒸汽育苗，刚开始，部分群众不相信。鞠家垡的“土专家”和县农技站几个技术员共同研究推广了蒸汽炉搞三床苗，既节约用煤，又不浪费劳力，全公社很快发展到四十二个蒸汽炉子。中技毕业的技术员陈善德同志说：“实践最重要，象我们这些从旧学校出来的人，只有和有实践经验的‘土专家’结合在一起，才能作出一点贡献，否则将一事无成。”
    四是让“土专家”学习必要的农业技术理论知识，使他们的实践经验上升到理论的高度，再回来指导生产实践。公社农技站经常印发一些有关农业技术方面的科研材料，供“土专家”学习应用。以定期和不定期相结合的方式培训“土专家”，由县农技站一些同贫下中农结合得比较好的技术员讲授农业理论知识。大兴公社采取各种培训方法，在四年中共举行田头现场会、讲用操作会三百五十多次，培养了一支思想、技术都过得硬的技术骨干力量。从一九六四年到一九六八年，有七个县到大兴公社请了三十八名“土专家”去帮助搞技术革新，深受各地广大群众的欢迎。
      从“土专家”的成长，看农业
  教育革命的方向
    一、农业教育和农业技术大权就是要由工人阶级、贫下中农来掌。今后，农业院校要统统搬到农村，由贫下中农管理学校。过去农业院校的权掌握在资产阶级知识分子手里，实行资产阶级专政，坑害了许多工农子弟。这个公社有一个学生，过去在家时样样都干，考上农学院后，受了资产阶级思想侵蚀，从脸黑心红的贫农儿子，变成了脱离群众，脱离实际的“公子”。贫下中农说：“考上了大学后，一年一读，就看不起在家种田的同学，二年一读，不认得父母，三年一读，私心通天。真是‘雾迷天放鸽子，有去无来’。”因此，只有工人阶级和贫下中农掌握农业教育大权，才能使教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，才能培养出一大批又红又专的新型农业科技人员。
    二、农业院校的招生对象，要从心红眼亮，脚踩污泥，手上有茧的“土专家”中挑选。贫下中农说：“这样的苗子选去学习，我们才称心，放心。”教学内容要把阶级斗争作为主课，要理论联系实际，联系各地区农业生产的具体情况；要把“土专家”在第一线上遇到的实际问题带到学校里去研究，在理论上提高。到学校学一两年后再回到生产实践中来。学生的毕业证书要由贫下中农考核发给。
    三、原有的教师队伍，要进行彻底整顿，要由有丰富实践经验的贫下中农、“土专家”和同工农结合得好的知识分子组成。知识分子要走同工农结合的道路，分批下放劳动，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。
