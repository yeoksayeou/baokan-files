As dusk fell, the manager of the cultural center in Xinglinyu Brigade, Beijing's suburbs, Xu Zhiquan, posted a large red poster at the crossroads. The villagers returning from work took one look and their hearts filled with joy. They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

What was going on? It turned out that the village's propaganda team was going to perform that evening, and the first act was Wang Xiaoling singing "The East Is Red." Everyone knew that "The East Is Red" was the most powerful song, and everyone in the country knew how to sing it. But why did Wang Xiaoling's singing cause such a stir in the village? Let me explain. Wang Xiaoling was the only daughter of the old poor peasant Wang Tieshan in Xinglinyu Brigade. She was smart and lively, with a voice as clear as a bell. Everyone in the village loved this little girl. But three years ago, she suddenly fell ill and became mute. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the brigade's "barefoot doctor," Xu Zhiquan, managed to cure Xiaoling's illness. Tonight, Xiaoling was going to sing for everyone. You can imagine how excited the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire village were! How could they not be happy? How could they not shout with joy?

At this point, some comrades might ask: Isn't Xu Zhiquan the manager of the cultural center? How did he become a "barefoot doctor"?

Let me start from the beginning. In 1963, after finishing junior high school, Xu Zhiquan responded to Chairman Mao's call and returned to the countryside to engage in agricultural production. This young man had a firm stance, was full of vigor, had good thoughts, and was full of energy. He was reliable and had a lot of influence in the brigade. So, the brigade entrusted him with the work of the youth and the cultural center.

Three years ago in the spring, nine-year-old Xiaoling fell seriously ill. Zhiquan and Grandpa Tieshan quickly took Xiaoling to the county hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, as soon as they entered the hospital, they encountered the director. That guy was colder to us poor peasants than an ice pop! He pushed his glasses up his nose and snarled, "We can't treat this illness. You should take her to Beijing!" With that, he slammed the door shut. Because of this delay, Xiaoling's illness worsened, and she eventually became mute.

This incident was like a nail driven into Zhiquan's heart. He thought: When will this lively little Xiaoling be able to speak and sing again?

Fortunately, that winter, the commune health center responded to Chairman Mao's call to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," and trained semi-agricultural, semi-medical health workers for the brigade, which is what we now call "barefoot doctors." The brigade decided to send Zhiquan for training, and Zhiquan was overjoyed, thinking to himself: I must personally cure Xiaoling's illness! Over the past two years, he not only learned acupuncture, medication, and herbal prescriptions, but also worked day and night to find a cure for Xiaoling's illness. He worked tirelessly, enduring cold words and not fearing "experts" or "authorities." This is truly the case: once revolutionary masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they are invincible! Look at Zhiquan, he didn't believe in heaven, didn't believe in the earth, didn't believe in foreign books, and didn't believe in old frameworks. Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, he managed to cure Xiaoling's illness!

The storyteller's mouth doesn't have a lid, and before you know it, the story has gone off track. Let's get back to the point. Just as Zhiquan had finished posting the notice, an old man suddenly rushed up, his hands touching the poster, and tears streamed down his face like broken beads. He was Grandpa Tieshan. Grandpa looked at the poster, thinking back and forth, his heart churning. Suddenly, he turned around and asked:

"Zhiquan, who made Xiaoling unable to speak for three years?"

"It was the traitor Liu Shaoqi! It was the capitalist-roaders in the county hospital!"

"I think our program should add some content," Grandpa Tieshan said, sharing his idea with Zhiquan. Zhiquan listened and slapped his thigh, saying, "Great! Let's do it your way! We'll act separately!"

That evening, the community members packed the cultural center courtyard. People from all around came. Before long, it was time for the performance to begin. Zhiquan stepped onto the stage and said to everyone, "Comrades of the poor and lower-middle peasants, tonight, Xiaoling is going to sing 'The East Is Red' for us again!"

"Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

In an instant, the cheers rose like a tide, one wave higher than the next.

Zhiquan raised his voice and said, "Think about it, comrades, who made a lively child unable to speak for three years? It was the big villain Liu Shaoqi! It was the stinking fish and rotten shrimp on the medical and health front line of Liu Shaoqi! The former director of the county hospital was Liu Shaoqi's black henchman, a Nationalist Party lieutenant colonel. After liberation, he relied on Liu Shaoqi's big black umbrella and infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, doing everything he could to harm us poor and lower-middle peasants. Now, he has been exposed by the revolutionary masses of the county hospital! Tonight, we will settle accounts with him, and with Liu Shaoqi!"

"Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi!"

"Thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line!"

Amidst the angry slogans, the masses denounced the heinous crimes of the traitor Liu Shaoqi in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line. Finally, Grandpa Tieshan pointed at the former director of the county hospital and said, "Everyone, you've seen it! This bad guy, a remnant of the Nationalist Party, can't serve us poor and lower-middle peasants. Our revolutionary new generation, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, 'barefoot doctors,' are much more skilled! He couldn't cure the illness that we have cured, and Xiaoling, who was made mute for three years, is now going to sing 'The East Is Red'!"

As Grandpa Tieshan's words fell, joyful music and warm applause filled the air. Xiaoling, with tears of joy, ran onto the stage and sang with all her heart.

In the valleys, the most powerful song in the world echoed:

"The East is red, the sun is rising,
China has given birth to a Mao Zedong."

    《东方红》歌声响彻山洼洼
    （革命故事）
    肖流
    天擦黑的时候，北京郊区杏林峪大队俱乐部的负责人许志全，在十字街口贴出了一张大红海报。下工回来的社员们一瞧，心里可就乐开了花，一个个高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    这是咋回事？原来，村里的宣传队晚上要演节目，第一个节目就是王小玲高唱《东方红》。同志们都知道，最响亮的歌是《东方红》，全国革命人民人人会唱。那为啥王小玲一唱，就轰动了全村？话不说不明，理不讲不透。王小玲本是杏林峪大队老贫农王铁山大爷的独生闺女，长得聪明伶俐，嗓子象银铃。全村人人喜欢这个小姑娘，可她偏偏在三年前得了场急病，一下子变成了哑吧。在无产阶级文化大革命中，大队的“赤脚医生”许志全硬是把小玲的病给治好了。今儿晚上，小玲还要给大伙唱《东方红》。你想，全村的贫下中农怎能不高兴？怎能不欢呼？
    讲到这里，有的同志要问：许志全不是俱乐部的负责人吗？咋又成了“赤脚医生”？
    话得从头说起。一九六三年许志全念完初中，就响应毛主席的号召，回乡参加农业生产。这小青年立场坚定，朝气蓬勃，思想好，干劲大，办起事来，丁是丁，卯是卯，在队里很有威信。所以，队里的青年工作啦，俱乐部的工作啦，贫下中农都放心让他去管。
    三年前的春天，刚满九岁的小玲得了急病。志全和铁山大爷赶忙把小玲送到县医院治疗。谁知进院就碰上了院长。那家伙对咱贫下中农比冰棍还凉哪！只见他把眼镜朝鼻梁上推了推，恶狠狠地说：“这病我们不能治，你们往北京市里送！”说完就“嘭！”的一声关了门。就这样，小玲的病给耽误了，后来变成了哑吧。
    这件事，就象颗钉子钉在志全心上。他想：啥时候能让这个生龙活虎的小玲子重新说话和唱歌？
    可巧，那年冬天，公社卫生所响应毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大号召，为大队培训半农半医卫生员，就是现在咱们说的“赤脚医生”。大队决定叫志全去学习，志全高兴得一蹦尺把高，暗自思忖：一定要亲手把小玲子的病治好！两年多来，他不光学会了扎针、用药、配偏方，治好了许多大医院治不了的病，还没明没夜地为小玲子的病想门道。他熬红了眼，跑细了腿。冷言冷语他顶住，“专家”、“权威”他不怕。这真是，革命群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想就天下无敌！你看志全，不信天，不信地，不信洋书本，不信老框框，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，硬是把小玲子的病根给除了！
    讲故事的嘴没遮拦，说着说着就扯远了。且说志全刚贴上海报，一个老人忽然扑了上来，双手摸着海报，眼泪就象断了线的珠子，掉个不停。他就是铁山大爷。大爷看着海报，思前想后，心里波涛翻滚。猛然，他回过头来问：
    “志全，是谁害得小玲子三年不说一句话？”
      “是大叛徒刘少奇！是县医院的走资派！”
    “依我看，咱这节目还得添点内容。”铁山大爷说着，把自己的打算告诉了志全。志全听罢，一拍腿说：“太好啦，就照你说的办！咱们分头行动！”
    晚上，看演出的社员们把俱乐部大院挤了个水泄不通。十里八村的社员们都来啦。说话间开演时间到了。志全登上舞台，对大伙说：“贫下中农同志们，今儿晚上，小玲子又要给咱们唱《东方红》啦！……”
      “毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    一下子，欢呼声就象那大海涨了潮，一浪高过一浪。
    志全提高嗓门说：“大伙想一想，是谁让一个蹦蹦跳的孩子三年说不出一句话？是大坏蛋刘少奇！是刘少奇在医疗卫生战线上的臭鱼烂虾！原先那个县医院的院长，就是刘少奇的黑爪牙，国民党的少校军医。解放后，他靠着刘少奇这把大黑伞，混进了革命队伍，想方设法地坑害咱贫下中农。现在，他已经被县医院的革命群众揪出来啦！今晚，咱要跟他算账，跟刘少奇算账！……”
      “打倒大叛徒刘少奇！”
      “彻底批判反革命修正主义卫生路线！”
    在愤怒的口号声中，群众控诉了大叛徒刘少奇推行反革命修正主义卫生路线的滔天罪行。末了，铁山大爷指着原县医院的院长说：“大伙都看见了吧？这个坏家伙，国民党的残渣余孽，根本就不能为咱贫下中农服务。咱们革命的新一代，用毛泽东思想武装起来的‘赤脚医生’，比他高明得多！他治不好的病，咱们硬是治好了，让他害得三年不能说一句话的小玲子，现在又要唱《东方红》了！” 
    铁山大爷的话音刚落，欢快的乐声，热烈的掌声，响成了一片。小玲子含着喜悦的泪花，跑上舞台，放开喉咙，纵情地唱了起来。
    山洼洼里，传出了世界上最最响亮的歌声：
    “东方红，太阳升，
    中国出了个毛泽东！
        ……”
