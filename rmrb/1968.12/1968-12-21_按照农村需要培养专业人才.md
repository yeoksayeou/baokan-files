Regarding the issue of how to run urban schools, we propose the following views:

First, full-time secondary schools originally under the jurisdiction of urban areas and counties should be transferred to urban communes for management, with poor and lower-middle peasants directly managing them, firmly grasping the power of education in their hands. The school system and curriculum should be determined by poor and lower-middle peasants in accordance with the principle that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," and in combination with the three revolutionary movements and specific needs of the countryside.

Second, county-level secondary schools should, based on the needs of agricultural production development and actual conditions, establish specialized classes in agricultural machinery, electrical, forestry, water conservancy, agricultural technology, pesticides, and agricultural medicine. These specialized classes should be affiliated with machinery factories, power plants, forest farms, county-owned farms, and hospitals, and managed by these departments. This way, learning can be closely integrated with production practice. We have conducted investigations in rural areas and found that poor and lower-middle peasants urgently demand the establishment of schools to cultivate these specialized talents. The students in these specialized classes should mainly come from rural areas, selected from those who have participated in three to five years of labor, have consciousness, and are culturally educated, generally following the principle of "coming from the commune and returning to the commune."

Regarding the school system and curriculum of these specialized classes, they should be determined by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants according to the characteristics of each specialized class and closely combined with the three revolutionary movements. The school system can vary from half a year to one and a half years. Such specialized classes can overcome the past phenomenon of schools being "detached from reality, detached from workers and peasants, and detached from practical work."

    按照农村需要培养专业人才
    对于城镇学校如何办的问题，我们提出以下几点看法：
    一、原属城镇、县管理的全日制中学应下放到城镇公社去办，由贫下中农直接管理，把文权紧紧地掌握在贫下中农手里。学制和课程设置都应由贫下中农根据“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的方针，结合农村的三大革命实践和具体需要而定。
    二、县城中学应根据农业生产发展的需要，从实际出发，开办农机、农电、农林、水利、农技、农药、农医等专业班。这些专业班应根据专业的不同，分别附属于机械厂、电厂、林场、县直属农场、医院，由这些部门来办。这样就可以把学习同生产实践紧密结合起来。我们到农村作过调查，贫下中农是迫切要求县开办培养这些专业人才的学校的。这些专业班学生的来源，主要是从农村参加过三、五年劳动，有觉悟、有文化的青年中选拔，一般做到社来社去。
    关于这些专业班的学制和课程的设置，要根据各专业班的特点，紧紧结合三大革命运动，由工人和贫下中农来定。学制可以半年、一年或一年半不等。这种专业班可以克服过去学校“三脱离”的现象。
