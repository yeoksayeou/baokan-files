The poor and lower-middle peasants of Songshuzhuang Brigade in Laoshan County, Shandong Province, have resolutely responded to the call to arms issued in the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. They are currently denouncing Liu Shaoqi, the traitor, for spreading his extremely reactionary "theory of the backwardness of the masses" at a criticism meeting in the fields.

Militia instructor Zhang Shivei angrily declared: "Liu Shaoqi, this wolf-hearted and dog-lunged scoundrel, in order to suppress the revolutionary enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants and achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism, madly opposed our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao's great teaching that 'the masses are the real heroes.' He dared to call us poor and lower-middle peasants 'fools,' 'idiots,' and 'inferior people.' He said things like, 'scatterbrainedness, conservatism, narrow-mindedness, backwardness... these are the characteristics of peasants,' and so on. This is the greatest slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants. Let us use facts to smash it to smithereens!"

At this, the meeting immediately erupted with shouts of "Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" and "Don't let the renegade Liu Shaoqi smear the faces of the poor and lower-middle peasants!"

As the slogans subsided, Zhang Daima stepped forward and continued, "Pfft! Liu Shaoqi, this black-hearted wolf! He slanders us as backward and narrow-minded, trying to shackle us with these big hats, wanting us to spend our days around the stove, only caring about the old hens in the yard, and not about national affairs. He's blind as a bat! We poor and lower-middle peasants care most about national affairs and are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Take our 71-year-old 'old but red' Fu Grandma, for example. She thinks of Chairman Mao in her heart and the whole world in her mind. The other day, she voluntarily turned in 20 jin of grain she had saved from her daily frugal living to the state. She said that we've lived a good life, but we must not forget to liberate Taiwan, nor forget the laboring people all over the world who eat tree bark and wear ragged clothes! It's not just the old people and the youth, even my little Red New, when you shout 'Down with Liu Shaoqi,' he raises his little fist; every day he sings 'The East is Red,' studies Chairman Mao's quotations, and these big events, he all participates in. We salute Chairman Mao, and he enthusiastically salutes Chairman Mao too. But Liu Shaoqi says we poor and lower-middle peasants are backward, he just wants to trample us under his feet and manipulate us, this will never happen!"

Zhang Shitian, an active learner and propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought from Qingdao City, and the head of the brigade's Revolutionary Committee, could no longer hold back his anger. He held up a red copy of the revolutionary classic, shouting "Down with Liu Shaoqi!" and stood up to speak. He indignantly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history.' Chairman Mao believes in and relies on us poor and lower-middle peasants the most. We poor and lower-middle peasants have only one heart, and we never leave Chairman Mao's side in revolution. In times of war, we actively supported the front, together with the soldiers, we defeated the Japanese invaders and annihilated the Kuomintang bandits; in the period of socialist construction, we raised high the bright red banner of 'People's Communes are good,' resolutely took the broad path of collectivization; today, we again raised high Chairman Mao's banner of 'It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries,' and seized power from the capitalist roaders. Revolutionary practice has proven that the poor and lower-middle peasants have always been a vigorous revolutionary vanguard, 'Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution.' Liu Shaoqi, this dog, dares to smear us. We will not rest until we criticize Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of the backwardness of the masses' to the point where it stinks worse than dog shit!"

The criticism meeting was filled with fervor, and the angry slogans "Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" and "Thoroughly eliminate all the poison of the 'theory of the backwardness of the masses'!" echoed one after another in the air above Dongnan Gorge in Laoshan County...

    地头上声讨刘少奇
    山东省崂山县松树庄大队贫下中农，坚决响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报提出的战斗号召，正在地头批判会上声讨刘少奇这个叛徒所散布的反动透顶的“群众落后论”。
    民兵指导员张世伟愤怒地说：“刘少奇这个狼心狗肺的坏家伙，为了扼杀贫下中农的革命积极性，达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，竟疯狂反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席‘群众是真正的英雄’的伟大教导，公然把我们贫下中农当成‘傻子’、‘阿斗’、‘下等人’。胡说什么：
  ‘散漫性、保守性、狭隘性、落后性……这些就是农民的特性’等等，这是对我们贫下中农的最大污蔑。让我们用事实把它砸个稀巴烂！”
    这时，会场上立即响起“打倒大叛徒刘少奇！”“不许工贼刘少奇往贫下中农脸上抹黑！”的怒吼声。
    口号声刚一停，张大嫂跨前一步，又接上了火：“呸！刘少奇这个黑心狼！污蔑咱落后狭隘，用这几顶大帽子来束缚咱，妄想叫我们成天围着锅台转，只看着院里的老母鸡，不关心国家大事，真是瞎了狗眼！我们贫下中农最关心国家大事，无限忠于毛主席，就拿咱那七十一岁的‘人老心红’的傅大娘来说吧，她心里想着毛主席，装着全世界。前几天，又主动把平日省吃俭用节约下来的二十斤余粮交售给了国家，她还说咱过上了好日子，可不能忘了解放台湾，也不能忘了全世界那些吃树皮穿破麻袋的劳苦人民！不光是老人、青年这样，就连我家的小红新，你喊打倒刘少奇，他就举起小拳头；每天唱《东方红》，学习毛主席语录这几件大事，他都参加，我们给毛主席敬礼，他也热情地向毛主席敬礼。而刘少奇却说我们贫下中农落后，就是想把我们踩在他的脚底下，受他的摆布，这是永远办不到的！”
    青岛市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、大队革委会负责人张世田也早就按不住心头的怒火，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书，高呼着“打倒刘少奇！”的口号，站起来发言，他气愤地说，毛主席教导咱说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”，毛主席最相信最依靠咱们贫下中农。咱贫下中农也只有一个心眼，寸步不离毛主席干革命。战争年代，我们积极支前，同子弟兵一道打败了日寇，消灭了蒋匪；在社会主义建设时期，高举着“人民公社好”的鲜红大旗，坚决走集体化的康庄大道；今天，又高举毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，夺了走资派的权。革命的实践证明，贫下中农始终是一支朝气蓬勃的革命主力军，“没有贫农，便没有革命”。刘少奇这个狗东西硬往我们脸上抹黑，不把刘少奇的“群众落后论”批得比狗屎还臭，誓不罢休！
    批判会上群情激昂，“打倒叛徒刘少奇”、“彻底肃清‘群众落后论’的一切流毒”的愤怒口号声，一阵紧一阵，在崂山东南沟上空震荡……
