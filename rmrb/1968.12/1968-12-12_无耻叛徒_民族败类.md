The reactionary film *Visit to Indonesia* blatantly exposes the true face of Liu Shaoqi, the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great scoundrel. As witnesses to Liu Shaoqi's "visit" to Indonesia, we are filled with indignation and must denounce him thoroughly!

Liu Shaoqi's "visit" to Indonesia took place in April 1963, shortly after the closing of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. At that time, class struggle on the international stage was extremely sharp. The revolutionary peoples of the world, with China, Albania, and other Marxist-Leninist forces at their core, were engaged in fierce struggles with the imperialist and reactionary forces led by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, achieving continuous victories. In this context, as the Eighth Plenum's communiqué pointed out: "We must continue to raise the banner of opposing imperialism and safeguarding world peace, uniting all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to form the broadest united front against U.S. imperialism, other imperialists, and their lackeys in various countries." "We must continue to raise the banner of revolution, actively supporting the liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries, especially the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence and the maintenance of national independence."

However, during his "visit" to Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi openly opposed the Party Central Committee's decisions, peddling his counter-revolutionary line of "three surrenders and one destruction," attempting to extinguish the anti-imperialist flames of the Indonesian people and the peoples of the world, and playing the shameful role of a political agent and "red comprador" for U.S. imperialism.

During his stay in Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi was obsequious and submissive, constantly pandering to the U.S., not daring to touch a single hair of the U.S. In his public speeches, he did not mention opposing the U.S. When discussing the U.S. occupation of our sacred territory of Taiwan, as well as South Korea, South Vietnam, North Kalimantan, the Congo, Angola, Cameroon, North and South Rhodesia, he did not condemn the U.S.'s aggression and war crimes but, imitating Khrushchev's tone, blatantly displayed his false anti-imperialism and true surrender to the U.S., earning loud applause from the imperialists and the Western bourgeoisie's propaganda machines. They "praised" Liu Shaoqi for not mentioning the U.S. in his speech, "avoiding any direct attacks on the U.S.," and not even accusing the U.S. of invading China.

At that time, the U.S. and British imperialists together concocted the neocolonialist product—"Malaysia," a tool for the U.S. and British imperialists to re-enslave the peoples of Malaya, Singapore, and North Kalimantan, seriously threatening the security of the Indonesian and Southeast Asian peoples, and facing strong opposition from the peoples of the region. The Chinese people firmly support their just struggle. However, Liu Shaoqi in Indonesia coldly said, "You oppose 'Malaysia,' and we support that, without any hesitation." How despicable! Actively supporting the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is our consistent policy, and there is no question of "hesitation" or not. Liu Shaoqi's few words precisely exposed his standing on the side of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, and his ugly face of sabotaging Chairman Mao's revolutionary diplomatic line!

During Liu Shaoqi's "visit" to Indonesia, the U.S. directly orchestrated the formation of the "Malaysia-Philippines-Indonesia Confederation" by Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia, attempting to use it to suppress the people's revolutionary struggles in the region, strengthen the anti-China military encirclement, and tie Indonesia to its war chariot. This plot also met with strong opposition from the Indonesian and broad masses of the people in the region. However, Liu Shaoqi, this faithful dog of U.S. imperialism, not only did not expose the U.S.'s evil intentions but instead brought out the junk of "world unity" to serve the U.S. He openly advocated to the Indonesian bourgeoisie leaders, saying, "You belong to the same race and should unite," "In the future, the world will certainly move towards unity." What nonsense! What "should unite"? What "world unity"? This is Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary theory of "class reconciliation" and "class cooperation." If we follow his way, the future world will not all be "united" around the U.S., "unified" under U.S. rule!

Another major crime of Liu Shaoqi's "visit" to Indonesia was his relentless promotion of class capitulationism, advocating that the Indonesian revolution take the revisionist path of "peaceful transition."

Great Leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The national bourgeoisie is a class with two faces," "Some members of the national bourgeoisie are often good at deceiving the masses." However, during his "visit" to Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi completely deviated from Chairman Mao's teachings. He not only acted like a clown, fraternizing with the Indonesian bourgeoisie leaders, pulling and tugging, and colluding with them; he also brought out his old tricks from his days at the Hanyang-Pingxiang Iron and Steel Company, praising the Indonesian bourgeoisie leaders to the skies, calling them "national heroes of Indonesia," "great warriors against colonialism on the international stage," "leaders of Asian-African unity," "wise leadership," and so on, using every possible word of praise, to the point of being nauseating.

At the same time, Liu Shaoqi, this "parliamentary fanatic," also vigorously advocated that the Indonesian revolution take the path of "peaceful transition."

The Indonesian bourgeoisie absorbed one or two leaders of the Indonesian Communist Party into the cabinet as ministers, as a decoration for bourgeois dictatorship, deceiving the people and lulling the Indonesian Communist Party. This practice was highly appreciated by Liu Shaoqi. He enthusiastically said, "It's good for the Indonesian Communist Party to enter the cabinet as ministers; they can accumulate experience in managing the government," spouting nonsense.

Great Leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." However, during his "visit" to Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi brought out the "structural reform theory" played by the new and old revisionists to oppose Chairman Mao's famous thesis of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," attempting to prevent the Indonesian proletariat from establishing a new proletarian dictatorship by smashing the old state machine through violent revolution, and trying to lead the Indonesian revolution down the failed path of reformism.

As early as after the victory of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, Liu Shaoqi shouted: "The stage of peaceful democracy has arrived!" He eyed the seats in the parliament and the positions in the Kuomintang government, drooling, and even wanted our cadres to participate in the elections, openly wanting our party to hand over military power to the Kuomintang government to become officials. The practice of the Chinese revolution thoroughly shattered Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line of "peaceful transition"! Although Liu Shaoqi had already been badly beaten in China, his evil heart did not die, and he ran to Indonesia to actively peddle his revisionist black goods, wanting the Indonesian Communist Party members to become ministers in the government, to "accumulate experience in managing the government," which is to say, to go to the bourgeois government to become officials, to "accumulate" the "experience" of bourgeois dictatorship, and to surrender to the bourgeoisie. His intentions are so malicious!

During his visit to Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi not only peddled the black goods of "three surrenders and one destruction," actively serving imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, but also used his usurped position as "state chairman" to attack and distort our country's domestic and foreign policies in various occasions, defaming the great image of our people, and directly participating in the anti-China chorus of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction at that time.

Under the wise leadership of Great Leader Chairman Mao, our country has achieved brilliant achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, receiving enthusiastic praise and support from the revolutionary peoples of the world. Especially after overcoming the three years of severe natural disasters and the difficulties caused by the Khrushchev revisionist clique, the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit of our hardworking and brave people in overcoming all difficulties were even more evident. However, Liu Shaoqi, driven by his wolfish ambitions of opposing the party and the people, not only did not mention the brilliant achievements of our people under the leadership of Great Leader Chairman Mao in holding high the three red banners, nor did he mention the revolutionary spirit and rich experience of our people in overcoming the three years of economic difficulties through self-reliance and striving for progress. On the contrary, he sang in tune with imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, viciously attacking the three red banners, painting our domestic situation as pitch-black, and saying nonsense like: "Our main problem is economic imbalance, we have made great adjustments, because we have spread our projects too wide, our front is too long, we have cut down many construction projects," and so on.

After hearing Liu Shaoqi's reactionary propaganda, the representatives of the Indonesian national bourgeoisie expressed doubts and wavered about our country's construction achievements, while the right-wing officials were overjoyed, gaining capital to oppose China and communism, and using this as an excuse to carry out their reactionary economic policies, exploiting the Indonesian people.

It was in this conversation that the Indonesian right-wing officials saw that Liu Shaoqi was originally a man who wore the same pants as them, and they used the so-called "Chinese population" to repeatedly raise provocative questions, attempting to slander our country's foreign policy. However, Liu Shaoqi not only did not refute this according to Chairman Mao's great teachings of "China's large population is a great advantage. No matter how many times it increases, we can completely solve it, and the solution is production," but instead said nonsense like, "Many people, of course, is a problem, but you don't have to be afraid, we still have many places that have not been developed, and we will not invade other countries." Imitating the tone of the reactionary scholar Malthus, he made extremely vicious attacks on our great country and great people. According to Liu Shaoqi's nonsense logic, isn't it saying that our country's large population is indeed a problem, and when there is no place to develop in our country, we will invade other countries?

During his "visit" to Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi committed many treacherous and criminal acts of betraying the party and the country, committing heinous crimes. For more than forty years, at every important moment and major issue in the development of the Chinese revolution, Liu Shaoqi has jumped out to fiercely oppose Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and is a traitor, internal enemy, and scoundrel of the worst kind, a faithful dog of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction. We must continue to raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly settle his accounts of betraying the party and the country, and denounce him deeply, thoroughly, and completely, so that he will never be able to rise again!

    无耻叛徒　民族败类
    群向东
    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》，赤裸裸地暴露出刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼的本来面目。作为当时刘少奇“访问”印尼的见证人的我们，怀着满腔愤怒，一定要把他批倒批臭！一
    刘少奇“访问”印尼，是在一九六三年四月，正是中国共产党八届十中全会闭幕之后不久。当时，国际范围内的阶级斗争十分尖锐。以中国、阿尔巴尼亚等国马克思列宁主义力量为核心的世界革命人民，同以美帝、苏修为首的世界反动势力正在进行激烈的搏斗，并不断地取得了胜利。在这种情况下，正如八届十中全会公报所指出的：“我们应当继续高举反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的旗帜，团结全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，结成最广泛的反对美帝国主义者、其他帝国主义者及其在各国的走狗的统一战线。”“我们应当继续高举革命的旗帜，积极支持各国人民的解放斗争，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。”
    可是，刘少奇在印尼“访问”时，公然反对党中央的决定，大肆贩卖其“三降一灭”的反革命路线，妄图扑灭印尼人民和世界各国人民的反帝烈火，充当了美帝国主义的政治掮客和“红色买办”的可耻角色。
    在印尼期间，刘少奇卑躬屈膝，处处迎合美帝，不敢触动美帝的一根毫毛。他在公开讲话中，闭口不谈反对美帝。在提到美帝侵占我国神圣领土台湾以及南朝鲜、南越、北加里曼丹、刚果、安哥拉、喀麦隆、南北罗得西亚等问题时，他也不谴责美帝的侵略和战争罪行，却学着赫鲁晓夫的腔调，大亮其假反帝、真降美的丑相，博得了帝国主义者和西方资产阶级宣传机器的大声喝彩。他们“称赞”刘少奇在讲话中“完全没有提到中国领袖们常常谈到的美国”，“避免对美国作任何直接攻击”，“连指控美国侵略中国的说法都没有”。
    那时候，美帝伙同英帝一道炮制了新殖民主义的产物——“马来西亚”，这是美、英帝国主义者重新奴役马来亚、新加坡和北加里曼丹人民的工具，严重地威胁着印尼和东南亚各国人民的安全，遭到了这个地区人民的强烈反对。中国人民坚决支持他们的正义斗争。可是，刘少奇在印尼却冷冰冰地说什么：“你们反对‘马来西亚’，我们是支持的，没有什么顾虑。”多么可恶！积极支持亚、非、拉民族反帝反殖的斗争，是我国的一贯方针，根本不存在什么“顾虑”不顾虑的问题。刘少奇这寥寥数语，恰好暴露了他站在帝、修、反立场上，破坏毛主席革命外交路线的丑恶嘴脸！
    刘少奇“访问”印尼时，美帝正直接出面拼凑由马来亚、菲律宾、印尼三国组成的“马菲印邦联”，企图用以镇压这个地区的人民革命斗争，加强反华军事包围圈，将印尼拴在它的侵略战车上。这个阴谋也遭到了印尼和这个地区广大人民的坚决反对。可是，刘少奇这条美帝的忠实走狗，不仅不揭露美帝的罪恶用心，反而搬出所谓“世界大同”的破烂货来为美帝效劳。他公然对印尼资产阶级头面人物鼓吹说，“你们属于同一种族，应该团结起来”，“将来世界总是要走向大同嘛”。真是混账逻辑！什么“应该团结”？什么“世界大同”？这就是刘少奇“阶级调和”、“阶级合作”的反革命理论。照他的办法办，那将来的世界还不都是“团结”在美帝的周围，“大同”在美帝的统治之下！二
    刘少奇“印尼之行”的另一个大罪行，就是竭力推销阶级投降主义，鼓吹印尼革命走“和平过渡”的修正主义道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“民族资产阶级是带两重性的阶级”，“民族资产阶级的某些分子常常是欺骗民众的好手”。可是，刘少奇在“访问”印尼期间，完全背离了毛主席的教导。他不仅象个跳梁小丑，同印尼资产阶级头面人物称兄道弟，拉拉扯扯，狼狈为奸；而且搬出他当年在汉冶萍公司吹捧资本家主子的本领，把印尼资产阶级头面人物捧上了天，说他是什么“印尼的民族英雄”呀，“国际上反对殖民主义的伟大战士”呀，“亚非团结的领袖”呀，“英明领导”呀，等等，等等，把一切赞美的字眼都用上了，肉麻到了极点。
    与此同时，刘少奇这个“议会迷”还极力鼓吹印尼革命走“和平过渡”的道路。
    印尼资产阶级吸收一、二个印尼共领导人入内阁当部长，作为资产阶级专政的点缀，欺骗人民，麻痹印尼共。这个作法，刘少奇表示非常欣赏。他兴致勃勃地说什么：“印尼共入阁当部长好，可以积累管理政权的经验”，一派胡言乱语。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”而刘少奇在“访问”印尼期间，却搬出新老修正主义者所玩弄的“结构改革论”来反对毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的著名论断，企图阻止印尼无产阶级通过暴力革命、砸碎旧的国家机器去建立崭新的无产阶级专政，想使印尼革命走上改良主义的失败道路。
    早在中国抗日战争胜利后，刘少奇就狂叫：“和平民主新阶段”已经到来！他望着议会里的席位，望着国民党政府里的官职，垂涎三尺，竟要我们的干部去参加竞选，公然要我党交出兵权到国民党政府里去做官。中国革命的实践彻底粉碎了刘少奇“和平过渡”的修正主义路线！刘少奇虽然在中国已碰得头破血流，但他贼心不死，又跑到印尼去积极兜售他的修正主义黑货，竟要印尼共产党员到政府里去当部长，去“积累管理政权的经验”，说明白一点，就是要印尼共产党人到资产阶级政权中去做官，去“积累”资产阶级专政的“经验”，向资产阶级投降。其用心是多么恶毒啊！三
    刘少奇访问印尼期间，不仅大肆贩卖“三降一灭”的黑货，积极为帝、修、反效劳，而且利用其窃据的“国家主席”身份，在各种场合中，大肆攻击和歪曲我国的内外政策，丑化我国人民的伟大形象，直接参加了当时帝、修、反的反华大合唱。
    我国在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了辉煌成就，受到了全世界革命人民的热烈欢呼和赞扬，特别在克服了三年的严重自然灾害和赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团给我国造成的困难以后，更显出毛泽东思想的伟大威力，更显出勤劳勇敢的我国人民能够战胜一切困难的革命精神。可是，刘少奇出于他反党反人民的狼子野心，不但闭口不谈我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下高举三面红旗所取得的辉煌成就，闭口不谈我国人民在克服三年经济困难中自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神和所取得的丰富经验，相反，他同帝、修、反唱一个调子，恶毒地攻击三面红旗，把我国国内形势描绘得漆黑一团，胡说什么：“我们的主要问题是经济失调，我们进行了大力调整，因为摊子铺得太大，战线拉得太长，我们砍了许多建设项目”等等。
    听了刘少奇的反动宣传，印尼的民族资产阶级代表人物即对我国的建设成就表示怀疑和动摇，而右派官员则欣喜若狂，捞到了反华反共的资本，并以此作为借口，放手地去推行他们的反动的经济政策，压榨印尼人民。
    就在这次谈话中，印尼右派官员看到刘少奇原来是同他们穿一条连裆裤的家伙，便利用所谓“中国人口”多次提出挑衅性的问题，企图污蔑我国的对外政策。而刘少奇不但不根据毛主席关于“中国人口众多是一件极大的好事。再增加多少倍人口也完全有办法，这办法就是生产”的伟大教导，加以驳斥，相反，却胡说什么“人多嘛，当然是个问题，不过你们不要害怕，我们还有很多地方没有开发，不会向外侵略”。学着反动学者马尔萨斯的腔调，对我们伟大的国家、伟大的人民，作了极其恶毒的攻击。按照刘少奇的混账逻辑，岂不是说我国人口太多的确是个问题，在我国没有地方开发时，我们就要向外侵略吗？
    刘少奇在“访问”印尼期间，干了许多叛党、叛国的罪恶勾当，犯下了滔天罪行。四十多年来，在中国革命发展的每一个重要时刻、每一个重大问题上，刘少奇都跳出来猖狂反对毛主席和毛主席的革命路线，是个十恶不赦的大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼，是帝、修、反的忠实走狗。我们一定要继续高举毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底地清算他的叛党叛国罪行，把他批深、批透、批倒、批臭，让他永世不得翻身！
