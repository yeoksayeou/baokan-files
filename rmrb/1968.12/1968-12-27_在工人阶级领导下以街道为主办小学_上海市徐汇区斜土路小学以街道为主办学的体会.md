The establishment of a leadership team with workers as the main body

Since May of this year, Xuhui District's Xietu Road Primary School and Rili West Road Neighborhood Committee in Shanghai have been experimenting with a method of running schools primarily by the neighborhood and in conjunction with factories. They have already gained some initial experience. The fundamental issue in running neighborhood schools is how to ensure the leadership of the working class. There are many retired workers living on Rili West Road, and they are a key force in managing the school. Following Chairman Mao's instructions that the proletarian educational revolution must have the leadership of the working class and the participation of the working masses, they established a leadership team composed of six aspects: the worker propaganda team, the factory (nearby affiliated factory), the neighborhood alley (retired workers, revolutionary parents, alley cadres), poor and lower-middle peasants, other working people, and revolutionary teachers and students of the school—the Educational Revolution Group. This group unifies the leadership of the school's educational revolution. Among them, workers (including retired workers) are in the majority, ensuring that the leadership power of the school is firmly in the hands of the working class.

School, society, and family education combined

The greatest advantage of running primary schools primarily by the neighborhood and in conjunction with factories is that it closely integrates school education, social education, and family education, so that students receive education from the working class both inside and outside the school.

In the past, old schools, under the control of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, implemented vertical leadership, closed-door schooling, and closed-door teaching. Although the schools were located in alleys and neighborhoods, they were far removed from the laboring masses, resulting in a phenomenon where school education was disconnected from social and family education. Consequently, students had no one to manage them after school, some played with fire, some threw mud, and accidents and troubles frequently occurred. A child from a dual-income family ran to the countryside to catch crickets, but told the teacher that there was something at home, and told the parents that he was in school. More seriously, some students were influenced by bourgeois ideology, picked up bad habits, and were even used and harmed by class enemies.

After running the school primarily by the neighborhood, the neighborhood committee organized a group of retired workers, alley cadres, and Red Guards to specifically take charge of the Red Guards' guidance work, organizing the Red Guards into resident groups. They held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for students during their out-of-school time, reading the "Three Old Articles," and old workers recalling hardships and sweetness to conduct class education. Retired workers and alley cadres also led the Red Guards to the front lines of class struggle in the alleys, fighting class enemies alongside revolutionary residents; they also had students participate in patriotic health activities, promoting water and electricity conservation, and other work, so that students learned many things in social practice that they could not learn in the classroom.

Because school education, social education, and family education are closely integrated, the spiritual face of the Red Guards has changed greatly. In the past, students did not listen to, ask about, or participate in alley class struggles, and could not distinguish class relationships among neighbors; some even called class enemies "grandfather" and "good grandmother." Now, the Red Guards have organized supervision groups, and the movements of class enemies are under the supervision of the Red Guards. Through participating in the struggle against enemies, the Red Guards' class consciousness has greatly improved. In the past, they spent most of their time at home "playing"; now, the Red Guards return home to participate in study classes, studying Chairman Mao's works. Everyone lives, studies, and fights together every day. In the battle-like collective life, good organizational discipline is cultivated. In short, running the school primarily by the neighborhood has many advantages, and it can be summed up in one point: integrating school, social, and family education. An old worker said, "From 'three disconnections' to 'three integrations,' we, the working class, will definitely be able to cultivate revolutionary successors loyal to Chairman Mao."

Running the school primarily by the neighborhood can also implement learning from workers and learning from peasants. In addition to arranging revolutionary teachers and students to work in factories, shops, markets, and other places affiliated with the neighborhood, the Educational Revolution Group also organizes revolutionary teachers and students to take turns working in affiliated factories, so that broad revolutionary teachers and students have more contact with workers and learn the excellent qualities of the working class. Usually, they also invite old workers from the factory to come to the school to teach classes on class struggle and production struggle. The revolutionary committee of the affiliated factory (Shanghai Sanitation Materials Factory) also cares about and supports the school's educational revolution, often sending people to the school to jointly study the school's educational revolution with the Educational Revolution Group. The school also hooks up with nearby communes, regularly organizing revolutionary teachers and students to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor, learn from poor and lower-middle peasants, and participate in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside.

Teachers go to the alleys, promoting thought revolutionization

Before running the school primarily by the neighborhood, teachers only taught in the school, rarely went out of the school gate, and even when they occasionally went to the homes of the laboring masses, it was usually for "no reason to visit the three treasures," either to collect tuition or to "report" to the students' parents. Once, a parent saw the teacher coming from afar, thinking that she was coming to "report" again, and grabbed the child and beat him. Naughty students made up a rhyme: "Not afraid of heaven, not afraid of earth, only afraid of the teacher coming to my home..." In this way, some teachers were also afraid to go to the alleys.

After running the school primarily by the neighborhood, not only is the school the base for teachers' work, but the alley also becomes the base for teachers' work. Revolutionary teachers often go to the alleys, fixedly participating in the activities of a resident group, and together with retired old workers and other laboring masses, studying Chairman Mao's works, reading newspapers, carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, recalling hardships and sweetness, fiercely fighting class enemies, and carrying out educational revolution. In this way, teachers received re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, promoting thought revolutionization. The relationship between teachers and laboring masses and revolutionary parents became harmonious, and when students had problems, they cooperated to solve them. A worker parent deeply felt, "In the past, teachers and we seemed to have a wall between us; we were strangers. Now, we are heart to heart, we are one family."

    在工人阶级领导下以街道为主办小学
    ——上海市徐汇区斜土路小学以街道为主办学的体会
    建立以工人为主体的领导班子
    上海市徐汇区斜土路小学和日晖西路里委会，从今年五月份起，试行以街道为主、与工厂结合办学的办法，现已取得初步经验。街道办学校，根本的问题是怎样确保工人阶级的领导。居住在日晖西路的退休工人较多，这是管理学校的一支骨干力量。他们遵照毛主席实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加的教导，建立了由工人宣传队、工厂（附近挂钩工厂）、街道里弄（退休工人、革命家长、里弄干部）、贫下中农、其他劳动人民、学校革命师生等六个方面组成的领导班子——教育革命小组，统一领导学校的教育革命。其中工人（包括退休工人）占优势，保证学校领导大权牢牢地掌握在工人阶级手里。
        学校、社会、家庭三结合教育
    小学以街道为主，与工厂结合办，最大的优点，就是使学校教育、社会教育、家庭教育紧密地结合起来，使学生在校内外都受到工人阶级的教育。
    过去，旧学校在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的控制下，实行垂直领导，关门办学，关门教学，虽然学校办在里弄、街道里，却远离劳动群众，以致产生了学校教育与社会、家庭教育三脱节的现象。这样，学生放学回家没人管，有的玩火，有的丢烂泥，跌伤、闯祸的事经常发生。有个双职工的小孩，跑到乡下捉蟋蟀，他却对老师讲家里有事，而对父母说在学校上课。更严重的是，有的学生受到资产阶级思想的影响，沾染上坏习气，甚至受到阶级敌人的利用和毒害。
    以街道为主办学校以后，里委会组织了一批退休工人、里弄干部、红卫兵，专门负责红小兵的辅导工作，把红小兵按居民小组组织起来。他们在学生的校外时间，举办毛泽东思想学习班，读“老三篇”，老工人向学生忆苦思甜，进行阶级教育。退休工人、里弄干部还带领红小兵杀上里弄对敌斗争第一线，和广大革命居民一起批斗阶级敌人；还让学生参加爱国卫生活动，宣传节约水电等工作，使学生在社会实践中学到不少在课堂里学不到的东西。
    由于学校教育、社会教育、家庭教育紧密结合，使红小兵的精神面貌起了很大变化。过去学生对里弄的阶级斗争是不听、不问、不参加，分不清邻里之间的阶级关系，有的还称阶级敌人为“公公”“好婆”。现在红小兵组织了监督小组，阶级敌人的一举一动都处于红小兵的监督下。通过参加对敌斗争，红小兵的阶级觉悟大大提高了。过去他们回到家里，大部分时间都花在“玩”上，现在红小兵回到家里，就参加学习班，学习毛主席著作。大家每天都生活、学习、战斗在一起。在战斗化的集体生活中，培养了良好的组织纪律性。总之，以街道为主办学，好处很多，集中到一点，就是使学校、社会、家庭教育三结合。有个老工人说：“由‘三脱节’变‘三结合’，我们工人阶级一定能培养出忠于毛主席的革命接班人。”
    以街道为主办学校，同样也可以学工学农。教育革命小组除了安排革命师生参加本街道所属工厂、商店、菜场等劳动外，还组织革命师生轮流到挂钩的工厂参加劳动，使广大革命师生更多地接触工人，学习工人阶级的优秀品质。平时，他们还请工厂的老工人来校给学生上阶级斗争课和生产斗争课。挂钩工厂（上海卫生材料厂）的革委会也十分关心和支持学校的教育革命，经常派人来校和教育革命小组共同研究学校的教育革命。学校还和附近公社挂钩，定期组织革命师生下乡参加农业劳动，向贫下中农学习，参加农村三大革命运动。
      教师下里弄，促进了思想革命化
    在以街道为主办学以前，教师只是在校内关门教书，平时很少走出校门，即使偶尔到劳动人民家里去，也是“无事不登三宝殿”，不是收学费，就是向学生家长“告状”。有一次，一个家长远远看见教师走来，以为又是来“告状”了，抓住自己孩子就打。调皮的学生编了个顺口溜：“天不怕，地不怕，只怕老师到我家……”这样，有些教师也怕下里弄。
    以街道为主办学校以后，不仅学校是教师工作的基地，里弄也成了教师工作的基地。革命教师经常下里弄，固定参加一个居民小组的活动，和退休老工人及其他劳动群众一起，学习毛主席著作，读报，开展革命大批判，进行忆苦思甜，狠斗阶级敌人，开展教育革命。这样，教师受到了工农兵的再教育，促进了思想革命化。教师和劳动人民、革命家长的关系融洽了，学生有什么问题，相互配合解决。一位工人家长深有感触地说：“过去老师和我们好象隔层墙，是陌生人；现在和我们心贴心，是一家人了。”
