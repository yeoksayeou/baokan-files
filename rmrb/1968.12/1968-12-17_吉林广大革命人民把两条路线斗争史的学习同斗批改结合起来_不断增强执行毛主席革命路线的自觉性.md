The revolutionary people of Jilin province, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have carefully studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and his brilliant report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee. They have closely linked this study with the actual class struggle, deeply launched a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary people of the entire province, strengthened the self-awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism and the struggle to criticize, struggle against, and transform.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the re-publication of Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee, the revolutionary masses in cities and countryside across Jilin province, with high political enthusiasm, quickly launched a study campaign focused on the history of the struggle between the two lines. Tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes spread across the province's cities and countryside, and hundreds of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propagandists went deep into workshops, mine pits, courtyards, construction sites, classrooms, and streets to widely propagate the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Leaders of revolutionary committees at all levels rushed to the grassroots, studying together with the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses, in their study, enthusiastically praised the greatness of the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said, "Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline. We must resolutely implement it and defend it to the death. Regarding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must talk about it every day, every month, and every year, so that our descendants can forever follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

In the course of study, the revolutionary masses in various places conducted investigations into the history of the struggle between the two lines in their own regions and units, combining the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines with the revolutionary criticism and the struggle to criticize, struggle against, and transform in their own units. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dongfeng and Yushu counties studied Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings on the socialist revolution and socialist construction in rural areas, extensively discussed the manifestations of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in their own units, extensively talked about village history, and extensively recalled family history, making Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply ingrained in people's hearts. The revolutionary workers in the First Automobile Works in Changchun and the Liaoyuan Coal Mine, among other factories and mines, conducted a mass movement of extensive study, investigation, and criticism around the struggle between the two lines in running enterprises. The First Automobile Works organized 149 investigation teams on the history of the struggle between the two lines, providing a large number of living teaching materials for the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, and promoting the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines throughout the factory.

Through investigation and research, closely linking with reality, and deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary criticism and the struggle to criticize, struggle against, and transform were powerfully promoted. The revolutionary masses in various places studied more and investigated more, loving Chairman Mao's revolutionary line more, and hating the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi more. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they fiercely criticized and denounced the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, thoroughly criticized the "February Countercurrent" of 1967 and the evil wind this spring to reverse the "February Countercurrent," and the revolutionary criticism throughout the province reached a new high tide. With the in-depth development of the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines and the revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses were further raised, and a new situation emerged in the struggle to criticize, struggle against, and transform in various units.

Members of the revolutionary committees at all levels, in leading the masses to deeply launch the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, set an example by studying first. They reviewed the sharp and intense class struggle before and after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, further raised their own two-line struggle consciousness, and strengthened their self-awareness of implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    吉林广大革命人民把两条路线斗争史的学习同斗批改结合起来
    不断增强执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性
    据新华社长春电　吉林全省革命人民，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，认真学习了毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的光辉报告，紧密结合阶级斗争实际，深入地开展了两条路线斗争史的学习运动，极大地提高了全省广大革命人民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，增强了执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性，有力地推动了革命大批判和斗、批、改的深入发展。
    毛主席的最新指示发表和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告重新发表后，吉林省城乡广大革命群众以高昂的政治热情，迅速掀起了一个以学习两条路线斗争史为内容的学习热潮。数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班遍布全省城乡各地，数百万名毛泽东思想宣传员深入车间、井口、场院、工地、课堂和街道，广泛宣传党内两条路线斗争史。各级革委会的领导成员纷纷深入基层，同广大革命群众一起学习。广大革命群众在学习中热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的英明伟大，颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力，颂扬毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。他们说，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们的生命线，我们一定要坚决执行，誓死捍卫。对毛主席的革命路线，我们就是要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，让我们子孙万代永远沿着毛主席的革命路线前进！
    在学习中，各地广大革命群众纷纷调查本地区、本单位两条路线斗争的历史，把两条路线斗争史的学习同革命大批判结合起来，同本单位的斗、批、改结合起来。东丰、榆树等县广大贫下中农，大学毛主席关于农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设的英明教导，大摆两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在本单位的表现，大讲村史，大忆家史，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心。长春第一汽车制造厂、辽源煤矿等厂矿企业的广大革命职工，围绕着办企业的两条路线斗争，开展大学习、大调查、大批判的群众运动。第一汽车制造厂组成了一百四十九个两条路线斗争史调查组，为学习两条路线斗争史提供了大量的活教材，推动了全厂两条路线斗争史的学习。
    通过调查研究，紧密结合实际，深入学习两条路线斗争史，有力地推动了革命的大批判和斗、批、改。各地广大革命群众越学越调查，对毛主席的革命路线越热爱，对大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线越仇恨。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭猛批刘少奇及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底批判一九六七年的“二月逆流”和今春为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风，全省革命大批判出现了一个新高潮。随着两条路线斗争史的学习运动和革命大批判的深入发展，进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，使各单位的斗、批、改出现了一个新局面。
    各级革命委员会成员，在领导群众深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习中，以身作则，带头学习。他们通过回顾革委会成立前后的尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争，进一步提高了自己的两条路线斗争觉悟，增强了执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性。
