The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Bolivia recently issued a statement strongly condemning the "Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax" imposed by the pro-American military dictatorship of Barrientos, which further exploits the peasants, and calling on the broad masses of peasants to unite with the working class and other revolutionary forces to struggle to overthrow the dictatorial rule of American imperialism and the reactionaries in the country.

The statement said: "The Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax is part of the policy of exploitation and enslavement of the Bolivian people by imperialism and its lackeys in our country. The establishment of the Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax is the result of the deepening colonial rule of American monopolies over the Bolivian people. The establishment of new taxes that destroy the peasants' economy is aimed at seizing their land on the basis of the peasants' increasing poverty and subjecting them to feudal-capitalist exploitation. This is the main purpose of the Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax."

The statement said: "The dictatorship attempts to shift the current economic crisis onto the peasants through the Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax. The current economic crisis is the product of the general crisis of capitalism and the policy of theft and corruption of the present government. The peasants will pay more taxes, while the profits of the bourgeoisie and imperialism will increase. The other purpose of the present government is to extort money from the peasants to increase the budget for the army and police."

The statement pointed out that the Communist Party of Bolivia firmly opposes the establishment of the "Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax" and any other tax laws that harm the economic situation of Bolivian peasants. The statement said that it is the duty of all communists and patriots to stand at the forefront of the peasant movement to successfully oppose the dictators and their imperialist masters.

The statement refuted the various fallacies spread by the military dictatorship to deceive the peasants in order to implement the "Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax" and pointed out that the voices of the peasants' struggle against the unified tax have shaken the foundations of the "Chimpanzee" court.

The statement said: "The Communist Party of Bolivia steadfastly supports the peasants' struggle against the Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax. This struggle, which is closely linked with the liberation struggle of the Bolivian people, will now and in the future receive the fighting support of the Communist Party." The statement then condemned the military dictatorship's savage policy of bloody suppression of the people, calling on the peasants and the people's forces to be fully prepared to deal with and smash the fascist military suppression. It announced that the Communist Party of Bolivia will resolutely counter the dictatorship's evil activities against the peasants and the masses with revolutionary violence.

The statement pointed out that the Communist Party of Bolivia believes that in order to successfully deal with the dictatorship, it is necessary to unite all patriotic forces. To this end, the Communist Party of Bolivia has put forward the revolutionary task of opposing the "Agricultural and Livestock Unified Tax" and struggling for national liberation to all revolutionary forces.

The statement emphasized: "The Communist Party of Bolivia calls on all revolutionary forces in cities and countryside, especially the working class, to launch a broad movement to support the peasants' struggle and oppose the reactionary pro-imperialist dictatorship."

The statement said that all revolutionary forces must be united to form a powerful front to smash the dictatorship's policies. "Workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and all revolutionary strata must unite not only to smash the policy of hunger and poverty in the mining areas but also to completely destroy the bourgeois regime that oppresses our people."

The statement of the Communist Party of Bolivia also called on party members to raise their political and ideological level and revolutionary vigilance in order to successfully fulfill their historical mission.

The statement pointed out that the current main task is to strengthen the party ideologically, politically, organizationally, and militarily so that it can shoulder the responsibility of leading the oppressed masses. "Our task is to stand at the forefront of all revolutionary movements, lead the movements, and defeat the enemies of the people at home and abroad."

    玻共中央发表声明强烈谴责亲美独裁政府的反动税收法
    号召农民和工人联合起来推翻亲美独裁政权
    玻利维亚共产党坚定地支持农民的斗争，并决心以革命的暴力还击独裁政府的镇压
    新华社二十九日讯 拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党政治委员会最近发表声明，强烈谴责巴里恩托斯亲美军事独裁政权制订对农民进行更加残酷剥削的“农牧业统一税”，并号召广大农民群众同工人阶级和其他革命力量联合起来，为推翻美帝国主义和本国反动派的独裁统治而斗争。
    声明说：“农牧业统一税是帝国主义和它在我国的走狗所推行的剥削和奴役玻利维亚人民的政策的一部分。建立农牧业统一税，是美国垄断集团对玻利维亚人民加深殖民统治的结果。建立破坏农民经济的新税收，是为了在农民日益贫困的基础上夺走他们的土地，对他们实行封建主义—资本主义的剥削，这就是农牧业统一税的主要目的。”
    声明说：“独裁政权企图利用农牧业统一税把目前的经济危机转嫁到农民身上。目前的经济危机是资本主义总危机和现政权盗窃和贪污政策的产物。农民们将交纳更多的捐税，而资产阶级和帝国主义的利润却增加了。”“现政权的另一个目的，就是从农民那里搜刮金钱来增加军队和警察的预算。”
    声明指出，玻利维亚共产党坚决反对设立“农牧业统一税”和其他任何损害玻利维亚农民经济状况的税收法。声明说，一切共产党人和爱国者的义务是站在农民运动的前列，来胜利地反对独裁者和它们的帝国主义主子。
    声明驳斥了军事独裁政权为推行“农牧业统一税”而散布的欺骗农民的种种谬论，并指出，农民反对统一税斗争的呼声，已震撼了“猩猩派”宫廷的基础。
    声明说：“玻利维亚共产党坚定不移地支持农民反对农牧业统一税的斗争。与玻利维亚人民解放斗争紧密联系在一起的这一具有历史意义的斗争，现在和将来都将得到共产党的战斗的支持。”声明接着谴责了军事独裁政权对人民实行血腥镇压的野蛮政策，号召农民和人民力量作好充分准备来对付和粉碎法西斯的军事镇压。并宣布，玻利维亚共产党将同人民一起坚决地还击独裁政权反对农民和人民群众的一切罪恶活动，用革命的暴力对付独裁政权。
    声明指出，玻利维亚共产党认为，为了成功地对付独裁政权，有必要使一切爱国力量团结起来，为此，玻利维亚共产党向一切革命力量提出了反对“农牧业统一税”和争取民族解放斗争的革命任务。
    声明强调指出：“玻利维亚共产党号召城乡一切革命力量，特别是工人阶级，开展广泛的运动，来支持农民斗争和反对反动的亲帝国主义的现独裁政权。”
    声明说，必须把所有革命力量都联合起来，结成一个强大的阵线来粉碎独裁政权的政策。“工人、农民、学生、知识分子和一切革命阶层联合起来，不仅要粉碎在矿区的饥饿和贫困的政策，而且要彻底摧毁压迫我国人民的资产阶级政权。”
    玻利维亚共产党的声明还号召党员提高政治思想水平和革命警惕性，以便胜利地完成历史使命。
    声明指出目前的主要任务是从思想上、政治上、组织上和军事上加强党，使它能够担负起领导被压迫群众的使命。“我们的任务是站在一切革命运动的前列，领导运动，战胜人民的国内外敌人。”
