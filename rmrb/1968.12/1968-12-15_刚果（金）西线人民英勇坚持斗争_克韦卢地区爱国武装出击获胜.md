Patriotic fighters in the western region of Congo (Kinshasa) have bravely persisted in their struggle, defying the brutal suppression and divisive tactics of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Mobutu regime. They continue their armed struggle, striking blows against the reactionary rule of the Mobutu puppet regime.

According to reports, the brave Congolese patriots recently attacked a sentry post of the Mobutu pseudo-army in the Kweulu region, inflicting heavy losses on the pseudo-army.

This military action by the patriotic armed forces has powerfully exposed the lies spread by the Mobutu puppet regime that the patriotic armed struggle in this region has been extinguished.

After the incident, the Mobutu puppet regime, with the support of its American masters, hastily air-dropped a large number of paratroopers into the Kweulu region to reinforce the pseudo-army that was "sweeping" through the area. At the same time, it dispatched its air force to indiscriminately bomb the villages there, slaughtering large numbers of local residents.

This is yet another crime committed by the Mobutu regime against the Congolese people. The Congolese patriotic people will never forgive this regime that brings misfortune to the country and its people.

    刚果（金）西线人民英勇坚持斗争
    克韦卢地区爱国武装出击获胜
    新华社十日讯　金沙萨消息：刚果（金）西线爱国者不顾美帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托集团的残酷镇压和分化瓦解，坚持武装斗争，打击蒙博托傀儡集团的反动统治。
    据报道，英勇的刚果（金）爱国者最近在克韦卢地区袭击了蒙博托伪军的一个哨所，使伪军遭到重大损失。
    爱国武装力量的这一军事行动，有力地戳穿了蒙博托傀儡集团散布的这一地区的刚果（金）爱国武装斗争已被扑灭的谎言。
    事件发生后，蒙博托傀儡集团在其美国主子支持下，急忙向克韦卢地区空投大批伞兵，增援正在那里“扫荡”的伪军，同时派出空军滥炸那里的村庄，大批屠杀当地居民。
    这是蒙博托集团对刚果（金）人民犯下的又一新的罪行，刚果（金）爱国人民是决不会饶恕这个祸国殃民的傀儡集团的。
