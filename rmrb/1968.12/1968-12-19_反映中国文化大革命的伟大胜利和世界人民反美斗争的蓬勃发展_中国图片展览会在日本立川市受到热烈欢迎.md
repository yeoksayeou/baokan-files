From December 7 to 11, an exhibition of Chinese pictures held in Tachikawa City, Tokyo, was warmly welcomed by the local people. During the five-day exhibition, about 15,000 spectators visited the exhibition.

This exhibition was jointly organized by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), the Sanmama branch of the Japan Socialist Party, and the alliance opposing the expansion of the U.S. Tachikawa Air Base in the Sand River Town of Tachikawa City.

The exhibition displayed 300 pictures, reflecting the great victory achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao; and reflecting the vigorous development of the anti-U.S. struggle by the people of the world and the Japanese people.

Japanese workers, peasants, and students who came to visit the exhibition enthusiastically praised the success of the exhibition. A spectator stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said: The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has given us Japanese people great encouragement. We must carry on the anti-U.S. struggle to the end. A middle school student from Tachikawa City said: "The seven hundred million Chinese people are the most reliable friends of the Japanese youth who are fighting to smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.' Our most important task is to firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought." A worker sincerely cheered for the great victory of the seven hundred million Chinese people in smashing the bourgeois headquarters represented by the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

So far, more than 1,000 places in Japan have held exhibitions of Chinese pictures and Chinese goods. These exhibitions have propagated the great Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses of the Japanese people and introduced the brilliant victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. These exhibitions have been warmly welcomed by the people of various places.

    反映中国文化大革命的伟大胜利和世界人民反美斗争的蓬勃发展
    中国图片展览会在日本立川市受到热烈欢迎
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：从十二月七日到十一日，在日本东京都立川市举办的中华人民共和国图片展览会，受到了当地人民的热烈欢迎。在展出的五天中，大约有一万五千名观众参观了展览。
    这次展览会是由日本国际贸易促进会、日中友协（正统）总部、日本社会党三多摩支部和反对在立川市砂川镇扩建美国立川空军基地联盟等单位联合举办的。
    展览会展出的三百张图片，反映了由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利；反映了世界人民和日本人民蓬勃发展的反美斗争。
    前来参观的日本工人、农民、学生热烈赞扬展览会的成功。一位观众站在毛主席的画像前面说：毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，给了我们日本人民极大的鼓舞。我们一定要把反美斗争进行到底。立川市的一位中学生说：“七亿中国人民是正在为粉碎日美‘安全条约’而斗争的日本青年的最可靠的朋友。我们最重要的任务，就是要牢牢地掌握毛泽东思想。”一位工人衷心欢呼七亿中国人民在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，摧毁了以叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部的伟大胜利。
    到目前为止，在日本已经有一千多个地方举办了中国图片展览会和中国商品展览会。这些展览会向广大日本人民宣传了伟大的毛泽东思想，介绍了中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌胜利。这些展览会受到了各地人民的热烈欢迎。
