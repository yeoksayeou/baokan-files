Recently, the cadres of Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, have restudied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the important editorial by the Central Committee and two newspapers and one magazine: "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines," and Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." They linked their more than ten years of struggle practice and conducted repeated discussions. They felt that Chairman Mao's words were particularly intimate, and every word and sentence struck their hearts, raising their thoughts to a new level each time they studied.

Before the "Official" Title, Stand Firm on "Three Unchanging Principles"

The secretary of the brigade party branch, Chen Yonggui, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must never for a moment depart from the masses. As long as we do not depart from the masses, we are sure to win." I understand that the position of a cadre can change, but participating in labor, maintaining contact with the masses, and living a hard and simple life—these three principles must never change. Because not participating in labor is the beginning of laziness and the opening for becoming a revisionist. Not participating in labor also means not maintaining contact with the masses, and a hard life will be forgotten. Cadres participating in collective production labor is a fundamental measure to prevent cadres from becoming corrupt.

It is easy to say that cadres should participate in labor, but truly persisting in it requires struggle. Looking back at the more than ten years of our Dazhai cadres, we have also had twists and turns. As early as when we established the primary cooperative, our party branch put forward two requirements for cadres: cadres should not let the masses support them, and those who do not work hard should not be cadres. Initially, we thought that we, these cadres who were once long-term laborers, would not forget labor. However, later, facts gave us a lesson. During the time of the advanced cooperative, once, several main cadres went to work in a larger cooperative, leaving an old cadre to work in the village. After a few months, we heard some comments: landlords and rich peasants said he was a good cadre, while poor and lower-middle peasants cursed him as unqualified. Checking the labor account book, we found that he had only worked for ten days in three months. We immediately used these living examples to educate him. Zhao Suzhen, a poor peasant's child who graduated from primary school and returned to the village, was appointed as the brigade accountant. After taking office, he was good at accounting, but he spent more time in the office and less time working in the fields. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Suzhen has graduated from school in terms of culture, but not in terms of labor, and cannot be a cadre." The party branch accepted the opinion of the poor and lower-middle peasants, replaced the accountant, and let Zhao Suzhen return to labor for tempering. A few years later, he became skilled in labor, and the community members elected him as the accountant again.

From the problems of an old cadre and a new cadre, we understood a truth: the issue of cadres participating in labor must be repeatedly emphasized, not just to cadres, but to the broad masses, letting the masses supervise cadres' participation in labor. Over the past more than ten years, we in Dazhai have done this, so the system of cadres participating in labor has been well implemented. In Dazhai's fields, it is hard to tell who is a cadre and who is a community member. Usually, community members call cadres by their names and surnames, not by titles like "secretary" or "team leader." The iron girls on the construction site challenge the brigade leader in singing: "Who leads the singing? Jia Chengran." This small matter also reflects the close relationship between our cadres and community members. Cadres are both leaders and ordinary people. Because our cadres do not depart from labor, they also do not depart from the masses, and can maintain a hard and simple style.

The chairman of the brigade poor peasants' association, Jia Jincai, said: Communists are revolutionaries, not officials. Some people, after their positions change, often slip from the "official" title into the "revisionist" swamp. When he is suppressed, he wants to rebel against the "official"; but after overthrowing the "official," he himself also catches the bad habit of being an "official," which is very dangerous. We cadres in Dazhai Brigade often say: "We must not take the road of the capitalist-roaders, but must take the new road." After Chen Yonggui became the deputy chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the chairman of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, he can be said to have become an "official." However, he does not act like an official when he becomes an "official"; he is still the same as us, and his laboring people's nature has not changed at all. He still wears a white headscarf, a peasant's shirt, and "kick-the-mountain" shoes on his feet. If he were to change to a fur hat, a four-pocketed suit, and leather shoes, it would be very easy. But he just does not change. He is afraid of changing his laboring people's nature, becoming an "official," and thus failing to be a servant of the people. Every cadre, whether old or new, should stand the test before the "official" title in this way.

### 在“官”字面前　坚持“三不变”

专栏：

    最近，山西省昔阳县大寨大队的干部，重新学习了毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，学习了中央两报一刊的重要社论：《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》，学习了毛主席的最新指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”他们联系自己十多年来的斗争实践，进行了反复讨论。他们觉得毛主席的话特别亲切，字字句句都说到了自己的心坎上，学一次思想上有一次新的提高。
    在“官”字面前　坚持“三不变”
    大队党支部书记陈永贵说：毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”我体会，当干部的职务可以变，但是参加劳动、联系群众、艰苦朴素这三条永远不能变。因为不参加劳动，正是变懒的开始，变修的缺口。不参加劳动，也就不能联系群众，艰苦生活也会忘记。干部坚持参加集体生产劳动，是防止干部变质的一条根本措施。
    干部参加劳动，说起来容易，真正坚持下去是要经过斗争的。回想我们大寨干部十多年来走过的路子，也是有曲折的。早在办初级社时，我们党支部就向干部提出两项要求：当干部不能让群众养活，劳动不好的人不能当干部。起初我们觉得，我们这些扛长工出身的干部不会忘记劳动。可是后来，事实给我们上了一课。高级社的时候，有一次，我们几个主要干部到大社工作去了，村里留下一个老的干部坚持工作。过了几个月，我们听到一些议论：地富分子说他是好干部，贫下中农骂他不称职。查一下记工的账，发现他三个月只劳动了十天。我们马上抓住这些活的事例对他进行教育。贫农子弟赵素恒高小毕业回村，担任了大队会计。上任后，算账挺利落，可就是坐办公室多，下田劳动少。贫下中农说：“素恒文化上毕业了，劳动上没毕业，不能当干部。”党支部接受贫下中农的意见，换了人当会计，让赵素恒再回到劳动中锻炼。几年后，他劳动过硬了，社员又选他担任会计。
    从一个老干部、一个新干部发生的问题，使我们懂得了一个道理：干部参加劳动的问题，要经常讲，反复讲，光给干部讲不行，要给广大群众讲，让群众监督干部参加劳动。十多年来，我们大寨这样做了，所以干部参加劳动制度执行得好。在大寨田里劳动，分不清谁是干部，谁是社员。平时，社员喊干部，根本不叫这书记、那队长，都是喊名道姓的。铁姑娘们在工地上赛歌，还向大队长挑战：“谁领唱？贾承让。”这件小事也反映了我们干部和社员的亲密关系，干部既是领导者，又是普普通通的老百姓。由于我们干部不脱离劳动，也就不脱离群众，能够保持艰苦朴素的作风。
    大队贫协主任贾进才说：共产党人是干革命的，不是为做官的。有的人地位变化后，往往从“官”字上向“修”字的泥坑里滑。当他受到压制时，要造“官老爷”的反；可是打倒了“官老爷”后，他自己又染上了当“官”的坏习气，这就很危险。我们大寨大队的干部经常说：“走资派的老路，咱不能走，要走新路子。”陈永贵同志担任了山西省革委会副主任、昔阳县革委会主任后，也可以说是当了“官”，可是他当了“官”不象官，还和俺们是一个老样子，劳动人民本色丝毫没有变。他还是头上裹着白毛巾，身上穿着农民衫，脚上穿着“踢倒山”的鞋。如果他要换一顶呢子帽，换一件四个兜的衣裳，换一双牛皮鞋，那很容易。可是他就是不换。他怕换掉劳动人民的本色，当了“官老爷”，就当不成人民勤务员。我们每个干部，不管是老干部，还是新干部，都应该这样在“官”字面前经受住考验。
