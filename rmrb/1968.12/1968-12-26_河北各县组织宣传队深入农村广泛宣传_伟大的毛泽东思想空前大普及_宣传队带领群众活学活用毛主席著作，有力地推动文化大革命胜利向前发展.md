Hebei Province's counties have organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter rural areas and widely promote the great Mao Zedong Thought. The propaganda teams lead the masses in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously pushing forward the victory of the Cultural Revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang on the 25th, Hebei Province's county revolutionary committees have organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter rural areas, promoting Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They lead the masses in carrying out the movement of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, pushing the Cultural Revolution towards victory.

Hebei Province's counties have three forms of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams:

1. Long-term teams. This form of propaganda team has fixed personnel, a fixed organization, and fixed political and organizational work systems. Most of Hebei Province's county revolutionary committees have organized such a core team. The members of the long-term propaganda teams include some military personnel supporting the left, some revolutionary cadres from county and commune organs, and some revolutionary cadres from county and commune organs.

2. Temporary teams. These propaganda teams are for short-term political tasks, with a shorter duration, and work in conjunction with long-term propaganda teams, including art troupes.

3. Base-level red propaganda cadres. Red propaganda cadres are established in factories, schools, shops, and production brigades, under the leadership of the base-level revolutionary committees and leading cadres to promote Mao Zedong Thought; when there are urgent political tasks, they cooperate with the county revolutionary committee's propaganda teams to carry out propaganda activities.

The central task of various types of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams is to promote Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary committee of Luancheng County summarizes the tasks of the propaganda teams as one red line and three aspects. One red line is to grasp the fundamentals: to promote and deepen the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and to emphasize proletarian politics. The three aspects are: to promote and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions; to consolidate and develop Mao Zedong Thought study classes; and to carry out revolutionary criticism.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "Forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the people of the whole country, and insist on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead in all work. This is the most fundamental task of our party's political and ideological work." Following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in Hebei Province's counties regard the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought as fundamental and place it above everything else. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of Wanquan County's revolutionary committee was just established and, under the leadership of the county revolutionary committee's responsible comrades, went to all 16 communes and 167 production brigades in the county to vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launching a ten-day large-scale propaganda campaign throughout the county, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions on establishing study classes quickly known to every household. Poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: Our revolutionary government leads us to establish study classes to study Chairman Mao's teachings. This is our poor and lower-middle peasants' wish. The members enthusiastically took action, establishing study classes in every household and production brigade. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in various counties did the same, quickly popularizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the province. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses studied Chairman Mao's works and his series of latest instructions in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, pushing the movement of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought into a new stage. Whenever Chairman Mao issued a new instruction, the propaganda teams in various counties, under the leadership of the county revolutionary committees, would immediately enter rural areas and widely promote it, playing a significant role in promoting the development of the province's revolutionary situation.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in various counties are also small political work teams. The military personnel supporting the left in the propaganda teams emphasize politics, have a firm stance, the revolutionary cadres have rich class struggle experience, and the revolutionary comrades dare to think and act boldly, full of pioneering spirit. These three forces combined form a strong and powerful fighting collective, playing an important role in the fierce and complex class struggle. After the establishment of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the revolutionary committee of Lulong County, they went to the communes and production brigades where class struggle was most intense, problems were most numerous, and work was most arduous. When the work of cleaning up class ranks began, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams went to the communes and production brigades where class struggle was intense and complex, mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, quickly exposing the cover of class struggle.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams organized by the revolutionary committees of various counties in Hebei Province are a large school for learning from the People's Liberation Army and a study class for actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The propaganda teams establish a strong political work system, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, insist on the "four firsts," carry forward the "three-eighths" style, and carry out activities such as "four-good" teams and team members, "five-good" team members, "one helps one," and "one red pair." After the propaganda teams went to the countryside, they lived, ate, worked, and studied Mao Zedong Thought with the poor and lower-middle peasants, achieving good results.

    河北各县组织宣传队深入农村广泛宣传
    伟大的毛泽东思想空前大普及
    宣传队带领群众活学活用毛主席著作，有力地推动文化大革命胜利向前发展
    据新华社石家庄二十五日电　河北省各县革命委员会组织毛泽东思想宣传队深入农村，宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的一系列最新指示，带领群众开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，推动着文化大革命胜利向前发展。
    河北省各县的毛泽东思想宣传队，有以下三种形式。
    一、长期的。这种形式的宣传队，人员长期固定，有固定的建制，有固定的政治工作和组织工作制度。河北省绝大多数县革命委员会都组织起这样一支骨干队伍。参加长期宣传队的人员，一部分是解放军支左人员，一部分是县、社机关的革命干部，一部分是县、社机关的无产阶级革命派。
    二、临时的。这种宣传队是为突击性的政治任务服务的，时间比较短，配合长期的宣传队进行活动，其中配备有文艺队伍。
    三、基层组织的红色宣传员。在工厂、学校、商店和生产大队设立红色宣传员，在基层革委会和领导班子的领导下宣传毛泽东思想；遇有紧急政治任务时，配合县革委会的宣传队进行宣传活动。
    各种类型的毛泽东思想宣传队的中心任务只有一个，这就是宣传毛泽东思想。栾城县革委会把宣传队的任务概括为一条红线，三个方面。一条红线就是狠抓根本：抓毛泽东思想的普及和深入，大力突出无产阶级政治。三个方面是：狠抓毛主席最新指示的宣传和落实；狠抓毛泽东思想学习班的巩固和发展；狠抓革命大批判。
    林副主席指示说：“永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装全国人民的头脑，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，是我党政治思想工作最根本的任务。”河北省各县毛泽东思想宣传队遵照林副主席的这一指示，把宣传毛泽东思想作为根本，摆在高于一切的地位。万全县革委会的毛泽东思想宣传队刚刚建立，就在县革委会负责同志带领下，分赴全县十六个公社的一百六十七个生产大队，狠抓办好毛泽东思想学习班，在全县展开十天的大宣传，让毛主席的关于大办学习班的最新指示，很快做到家喻户晓。贫下中农高兴地说：咱们的革命政权领导咱们办学习班，学习毛主席的教导，这是俺贫下中农的心愿。社员们积极行动起来，户户办，队队办。各县毛泽东思想宣传队都这样做，使毛泽东思想学习班很快在全省普及了。广大贫下中农和革命群众在毛泽东思想学习班里，大学毛主席著作和毛主席一系列最新指示，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动进入了一个新的阶段。每当毛主席发出一项最新指示，各县的宣传队都在县革委会的领导下，闻风而动，深入农村，广泛宣传，对推动全省革命大好形势的发展，起了很大的作用。
    各县毛泽东思想宣传队又是一支政治工作的小分队。宣传队中的解放军支左人员突出政治，立场坚定，革命干部有丰富的阶级斗争经验，革命派的同志敢想敢干，富有闯劲，这三股力量合在一起，组成了一个坚强有力的战斗集体，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争当中发挥了重要作用。卢龙县革委会毛泽东思想宣传队建立起来后，哪里阶级斗争最复杂，哪里问题最多，哪里工作最艰苦，他们就到哪里去。清理阶级队伍工作开始时，毛泽东思想宣传队分赴阶级斗争尖锐复杂的公社和生产大队，放手发动群众开展革命大批判，很快揭开了阶级斗争的盖子。
    河北省各县革委会组织的毛泽东思想宣传队，是一个学习人民解放军的大学校，是一个活学活用毛泽东思想的学习班。宣传队建立坚强的政治工作制度，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展“四好”队组和“五好”队员、“一帮一”、“一对红”等活动。宣传队下乡后，与贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习毛泽东思想，效果很好。
