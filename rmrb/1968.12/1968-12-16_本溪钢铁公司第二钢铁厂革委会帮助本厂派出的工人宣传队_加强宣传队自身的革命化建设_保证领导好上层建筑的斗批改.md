Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Second Iron and Steel Factory Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction, "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The working class must fully play its leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle," has earnestly helped the factory's dispatched workers' propaganda team strengthen its revolutionary construction, enabling the team to continuously raise its political consciousness and better shoulder the great historical task of leading the struggle to criticize and transform the superstructure.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the instruction, "The working class must lead everything," Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Second Iron and Steel Factory Revolutionary Committee selected a group of outstanding workers to form a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. Under the unified leadership of the municipal Revolutionary Committee, they entered some units of the superstructure and units where the struggle to criticize and transform had not been well carried out. After the workers' propaganda team entered the superstructure, the factory Revolutionary Committee carefully studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and unanimously agreed that sending the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team out did not mean that the factory Revolutionary Committee had completed its task. They must take various measures to help the team members actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, continuously raising their political consciousness. After discussion, they decided to adopt the method of going out and inviting in, regularly understanding the situation of the dispatched propaganda team, and listing this work as one of the important tasks of the Revolutionary Committee.

In the initial period when the workers' propaganda team entered some units, they were busy understanding the situation, and their work was relatively tense. The factory Revolutionary Committee promptly helped the propaganda team to insist on the system of study and life meetings in the midst of busy work. Some propaganda teams achieved results, and their work was reported in the newspapers, and higher-level leaders also praised them. The factory Revolutionary Committee promptly helped the propaganda team to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing team members to repeatedly study the "Three Articles," using the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to look at their own work, and using Mao Zedong Thought to help team members prevent the emergence of arrogance and complacency. The factory Revolutionary Committee also helped the propaganda team implement measures for its own revolutionization, formulating a system for team members to participate in labor in batches and periods, so that the team members would always maintain the character of ordinary laborers and always stand at the forefront of the struggle.

To help the propaganda team further actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, the factory Revolutionary Committee also adopted the method of inviting in, regularly calling back the propaganda team members to the factory, holding meetings to share experiences in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the team members' ideological revolutionization, and helping them to grasp the fundamentals in the midst of a thousand tasks.

The Second Iron and Steel Factory Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction, "We not only propose tasks but also solve the problem of methods to complete the tasks," not only helped the propaganda team raise its ideological consciousness but also regularly introduced advanced work experiences to the propaganda team, helping them to quickly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and carry out the struggle to criticize and transform in various fields of the superstructure.

The factory Revolutionary Committee also helped the workers' propaganda team to timely summarize the experiences of leading the struggle to criticize and transform the superstructure, helping them to take advanced models as examples, find gaps, take measures, and implement them, making the propaganda team's work continuously advance. At the same time, they often sent people to the places where the propaganda team worked and to the team members' homes, helping them solve difficulties in their lives. The team members were very moved by the factory Revolutionary Committee's concern for them. They said, "The factory Revolutionary Committee is our close friend, a good leader and good advisor who helps us implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions."

    本溪钢铁公司第二钢铁厂革委会帮助本厂派出的工人宣传队
    加强宣传队自身的革命化建设  保证领导好上层建筑的斗批改
    据新华社沈阳电　本溪钢铁公司第二钢铁厂革委会，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，认真帮助本厂派出的工人毛泽东思想宣传队搞好自身的革命化建设，使宣传队不断提高自己的政治觉悟，更好地承担起领导上层建筑斗、批、改的伟大历史任务。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“工人阶级必须领导一切”的指示以后，本溪钢铁公司第二钢铁厂革委会选拔一批优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，在市革委会的统一领导下，进驻了一些上层建筑和没有搞好斗批改的单位。工人宣传队开进上层建筑以后，厂革委会认真地学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，一致认为，把工人毛泽东思想宣传队派出去了，并不等于厂革委会已经完成了任务，一定要采取各种措施帮助队员在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高自己的政治觉悟。经过研究，他们决定采取走出去、请进来的办法，经常了解派出去的宣传队的情况，并且把这项工作列为革委会的重要任务之一。
    工人宣传队进驻一些单位的初期，忙于了解情况，工作比较紧张。厂革委会就及时帮助宣传队在繁忙的工作中坚持学习制度和生活会制度。有的宣传队工作作出了成绩，报纸报道了他们的工作，上级领导也表扬了他们，厂革委会又及时帮助宣传队大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织队员反复学习“老三篇”，用一分为二的观点来看待自己的工作，用毛泽东思想帮助队员们防止产生骄傲自满情绪。厂革委会还帮助宣传队落实自身革命化的措施，制定了宣传队员分批分期参加劳动的制度，使队员永远保持普通劳动者的本色，永远站在斗争的最前线。
    为了帮助宣传队在斗争中进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，厂革委会还通过请进来的方法，定期把宣传队员找回厂，召开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，促进队员的思想革命化，让他们在千头万绪中狠抓根本不转向。
    第二钢铁厂革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题”的教导，不仅帮助宣传队提高思想觉悟，而且经常向宣传队介绍先进工作经验，帮助他们以最快速度落实毛主席一系列最新指示，搞好上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改。
    厂革委会还帮助工人宣传队及时总结领导上层建筑领域斗、批、改的经验，帮助他们以先进典型为榜样，找差距、定措施、搞落实，使宣传队工作不断前进。同时，还经常派人到宣传队工作的地点和队员们的家里，帮助他们解决生活上的困难。队员们对厂革委会这样关心他们很感动，他们说：“厂革委会是我们工人的贴心人，是帮助我们落实毛主席最新指示的好领导，好参谋。”
