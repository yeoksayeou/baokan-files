A shocking contrast

The traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi has, for a long time, opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. He set up numerous barriers, excluding the children of workers and peasants from schools, advocating "intellectual education first," and attempting to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie.

From two investigations in our brigade, we can see Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

The first investigation: Our brigade's Fourth Production Team has 21 households of poor and lower-middle peasants. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they had 47 children who should have been enrolled in school, but only 21 were enrolled. Among the poor and lower-middle peasant children who were enrolled, 18 were expelled from school for failing to meet the "score barrier" and "age barrier."

The Fourth Production Team has four households of landlords and rich peasants, with nine children. All of them were enrolled in school; one graduated from university, two graduated from high school, and six graduated from primary school.

From these figures, we can see that only 44.6% of the poor and lower-middle peasant children who should have been enrolled were actually enrolled, while 100% of the landlord and rich peasant children were enrolled. Those who entered high school and university were all landlord and rich peasant children; not a single poor and lower-middle peasant child was among them.

The second investigation: A comparison between a household of poor peasants and a household of landlords in the Sixth Production Team. This household of poor peasants has six children, but only one boy graduated from primary school; the rest never even entered a school. This household of landlords has two children, one of whom graduated from high school and the other from university, both allocated to work in the city. This landlord arrogantly boasted to the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village: "I just need to send a letter to my children, and tens of yuan will immediately be in my hands!"

These two investigations deeply illustrate a problem: Under the rule of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, there are extremely serious problems in educational work; the school doors are open only to the children of landlords and rich peasants, while a large number of poor and lower-middle peasant children are deprived of the right to education. In reality, the poor and lower-middle peasants have not been liberated culturally.

The publication of the Communiqué of the Enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party declared the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line. We poor and lower-middle peasants must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, manage the schools well, and cultivate reliable successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    触目惊心的对比
    泰兴县永福大队贫下中农教育革命委员会
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，长期以来，反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，推行反革命修正主义教育路线，设置重重关卡，排斥工农子弟入学，鼓吹“智育第一”，妄图培养资产阶级接班人。
    从我们大队的两个调查情况，可以看出刘少奇推行反革命修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行。
    第一个调查：我们大队第四生产队共有贫下中农二十一户，在无产阶级文化大革命以前，他们应入学的子女四十七人，只有二十一人入学。在已入学的贫下中农子女中，又有十八人因为过不了“分数关”、“年龄关”，被赶出了学校。
    第四生产队四户地主、富农，有子女九人。他们全部入学了，其中一个读到大学毕业，两个读到高中毕业，六个读到高小毕业。
    从这些数字看，贫下中农子女入学的只占应入学人数的百分之四十四点六，而地、富子女则是百分之百。进入高中、大学的完全是地、富子女，一个贫下中农子女也没有。
    第二个调查：第六生产队的一户贫农和一户地主比较。这户贫农有六个孩子，只有一个男孩子读到小学毕业，其余就根本没进学校门。这户地主有两个孩子，一个读到高中毕业，一个读到大学毕业，都分配在城市工作。这个地主在村里猖狂地向贫下中农说：“我只要寄封信给孩子，几十块钱马上就到了手！”
    这两个调查深刻地说明了一个问题：在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的统治下，在教育工作中有着极其严重的问题；学校的大门是为地、富子女开的，而大批的贫下中农子女却被剥夺了受教育的权利。实际上，贫下中农在文化上没有得到翻身，没有得到解放。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，宣告了刘少奇和他推行的反革命修正主义路线的彻底破产。我们贫下中农一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把学校管理好，培养无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
