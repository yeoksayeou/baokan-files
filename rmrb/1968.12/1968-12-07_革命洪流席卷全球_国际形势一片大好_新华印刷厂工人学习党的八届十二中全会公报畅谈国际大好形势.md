The tide of revolution is sweeping the globe; the international situation is excellent. Workers at the New China Printing Factory study the communiqué of the 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee and discuss the excellent international situation.

The thunderous waves of revolution are shaking the five continents. The people's forces are launching a fierce attack against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

The communiqué of the 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee points out: "The Plenum believes that, as Comrade Mao Zedong has said, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The revolutionary movements of the people of all countries are developing vigorously."

In this great era, the people's forces are engaged in an unprecedented fierce struggle against reactionary forces. This is a struggle on a global scale. This is a struggle that will turn the world upside down. This is a struggle that will decide the fate of humanity and the future of history.

At this time when the Chinese people are in high spirits and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, looking at the world, the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries are surging. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the national liberation movements are deepening. In Europe and North America, the revolutionary struggles of the masses are becoming more intense. In the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the revolutionary people have already sounded the battle cry. Indeed, the seas are churning with waves of anger, and the five continents are shaking with thunderous roars. The revolutionary tide is surging forward, sweeping across the globe.

The vigorous development of the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries shows that a new great wave of struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is approaching. The people of various countries are uniting more closely to launch a sustained and fierce attack against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

The vigorous development of the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries shows that the old world of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries is accelerating towards collapse. Under the impact of the people's struggle, the ground under the feet of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries is shaking. The days of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are getting worse and worse.

The vigorous development of the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries shows that the international situation is excellent and getting better and better. The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day.

The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, warmly welcome and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. We are convinced that through their brave and sustained struggles, the people of various countries will definitely achieve the final victory!

The Red Flag Rises, the Serfs' Spears Are Unsheathed
The National Liberation Movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America Are Deepening

The vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the main battlefields where the people of the world are fiercely struggling against imperialism and its lackeys. Since the war, the revolutionary movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been surging, dealing a heavy blow to U.S.-led imperialism. Currently, the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are deepening.

In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, revolutionary mass movements are becoming increasingly widespread. The struggle of the people of Latin America is like a surging tide. Recently, the anti-repression and anti-massacre struggle of Mexican students shook the backyard of U.S. imperialism. In the Philippines, Turkey, and many other countries tightly controlled by the U.S., massive anti-U.S. struggles have also erupted. These facts show that the contradictions between the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and U.S. imperialism are further sharpening.

Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is increasingly resonating in the hearts of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning in the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In many countries of Southeast Asia, the people's armed forces, following Chairman Mao's great theory of surrounding the cities from the countryside, have gone deep into the countryside, mobilized the peasant masses, established rural base areas, and launched armed struggles. In these countries, peasants make up the vast majority of the population. They are deeply resentful and have a strong desire for revolution, making them the main force of the national democratic revolution. The red flag rises, and the serfs' spears are unsheathed. Millions of peasants are mobilized, organized, and armed, using guns to fight against imperialism and its lackeys. This is the victorious path of the revolutionary struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The Sea Boils, the Waves Surge
The Struggles of the People of Europe and North America Are Rising

The sea boils, and the waves surge. The storm of the people's struggles is fiercely impacting the entire Europe and North America.

This spring, the black people's anti-violence struggle that swept over more than a hundred cities in the United States pushed the people's struggles in the United States to a new high. Currently, the black people's movement in the United States is regrouping; the workers' movement and the student movement in the United States are also presenting a new situation.

The massive revolutionary mass struggle launched by the French people in May this year has had a profound impact. Since then, the waves of the people's struggles have risen and fallen in Western European countries, one after another, and recently, Italy has launched a powerful revolutionary mass movement. The workers' movement and the student movement in these countries are increasingly closely combined, and the peasant masses are also increasingly participating in the struggle.

The storm of the people's struggles has spread to the heartland of imperialism, Europe and North America, which is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of U.S.-led imperialism and an important sign of the increasing instability of the reactionary rule of the international monopoly bourgeoisie. At the same time, this has dealt a heavy blow to U.S.-led imperialism, making them sink deeper into an insoluble crisis.

The people of Europe and North America have awakened. After being tempered by the fire of revolutionary struggle, they will further raise their consciousness, strengthen their unity, and strengthen their forces; and they will join hands with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the revolutionary people of the world to fight together, launching a more fierce attack against the decaying imperialism and capitalist system.

The Warm Breeze Blows Over the Earth
The People of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe Have Sounded the Battle Cry

The battle cry has been sounded in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries under the rule of modern revisionism!

Recently, the "Stalin Group" in the Soviet Union distributed a leaflet calling on the proletariat and working people of the Soviet Union to rise up and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and restore the dictatorship of the proletariat. This inspiring revolutionary call reflects the common will of the Soviet people and expresses the fighting oath of the Soviet people.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has fully restored capitalism, making the working class and working people suffer twice. This bunch of traitors claims that the Soviet Union today has become a "state of the whole people," but in reality, under the rule of modern revisionism, class contradictions in the Soviet Union are developing more sharply than ever. The working class and working people of the Soviet Union must rise up to engage in a brave and tenacious struggle against the new bourgeoisie that sits on their heads. The sparks of the revolutionary struggle of the Soviet people will definitely develop into a prairie fire. This is the inevitable law of class struggle.

In Eastern Europe under the control of the Soviet revisionists, the struggle of the Czechoslovakian people against the Soviet revisionist armed occupation has never stopped. The hundreds of thousands of troops of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique not only fail to intimidate the Czechoslovakian people but also mobilize the Czechoslovakian people and the people of various Eastern European countries to rise up and struggle against the control of the Soviet revisionists.

The cold wind rolls in the high sky, and the warm breeze blows over the earth. The Soviet revisionists are tightening their fascist rule at home and pushing their social-imperialist policies abroad; however, the Soviet people want revolution, and the people of various Eastern European countries want revolution. They are accumulating strength and preparing for struggle. "The rule of revisionism will not last long." Chairman Mao's great prophecy will be proven by the development of history.

Millions of Workers and Peasants Are Eager to Join
Form a Broad United Front to Oppose U.S. Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism

The struggles of the people of various countries are mutually inspiring and supportive. Today, the revolutionary movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the revolutionary movements of the people of Europe and North America, and the revolutionary movements of the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, although they have their own struggle targets, have combined into a surging revolutionary tide, dealing a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are tightening their collusion, attempting to redivide the world and carve out spheres of influence to dominate the world situation and push forward neo-colonialism. They jointly suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, sometimes in secret agreement, sometimes in open cooperation. These two most ferocious enemies of the people of the world are wearing diapers when they collude in counter-revolutionary activities. Under this situation, the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the struggle against Soviet revisionism are more closely linked; opposing U.S. imperialism necessarily means opposing Soviet revisionism, and opposing Soviet revisionism necessarily means opposing U.S. imperialism.

The tightening of the counter-revolutionary collusion of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has prompted the people of the world to further strengthen their revolutionary unity. All the people oppressed by U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys must form a broad united front to thoroughly smash the evil plots of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to dominate the world, and to achieve their own victory and liberation. Now, more and more people have realized this truth. Millions of workers and peasants are eager to join. The proletariat and the broad masses of the people of various countries are joining hands more closely to fight together. A new great wave of struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is approaching!

Paper Boats and Bright Lanterns Illuminate the Sky
The Day of the Complete Demise of U.S. Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism Is Not Far

Currently, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are tightening their collusion, using armed suppression and political deception, the two counter-revolutionary tactics, to try to extinguish the flames of the people's struggles burning in various parts of the world. Their desperate counterattack has caused a counter-revolutionary backlash in the current international situation. However, the backlash will never become the mainstream.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The desperate counterattack of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism does not indicate their strength but rather their extreme weakness, indicating their impending doom.

U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, Soviet revisionism is a paper tiger, and U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism together are still paper tigers. They are ferocious and fierce, and they can scare some wavering people in the revolutionary ranks, but heroes drive away tigers and leopards, and heroes are not afraid of bears and wolves. The broad revolutionary people dare to despise these two giant monsters and will definitely continue the struggle.

The wheel of history will not turn back. Although the revolutionary movements of various countries may encounter various twists and turns, the awakened people will definitely push the wheel of history rolling forward. Through their brave and sustained struggles, they will definitely achieve a complete victory.

Paper boats and bright lanterns illuminate the sky. The day of the complete demise of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the two public enemies of the people of the world, is not far!

    革命洪流席卷全球　国际形势一片大好
    新华印刷厂工人学习党的八届十二中全会公报畅谈国际大好形势
    五洲震荡风雷激
    人民力量向帝修反发动猛烈进攻
    党的八届十二中全会公报指出：“全会认为，正如毛泽东同志所说，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。全世界各国人民的革命运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。”
    在当前这个伟大的时代里，人民力量同反动势力正在进行着空前激烈的大搏斗。这是一场世界范围的大搏斗。这是一场翻天覆地的大搏斗。这是一场决定人类命运和历史前途的大搏斗。
    在我们中国人民意气风发地夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时候，放眼世界，各国人民革命斗争风起云涌。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，民族解放运动正在深入发展。在欧洲、北美，革命群众斗争的风暴越来越猛烈。在苏联、东欧，革命人民战斗的号角已经吹响。正是，四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。革命的洪流，浩浩荡荡，席卷全球。
    各国人民革命运动的蓬勃发展表明，一个反对美帝、苏修的新的伟大的斗争高潮正在到来。各国人民正在更紧密地团结起来，向着美帝、苏修发动持久的猛烈的进攻。
    各国人民革命运动的蓬勃发展表明，帝修反统治的旧世界正在加速走向崩溃。在人民斗争的洪流的冲击下，帝修反脚下的大地整个在动摇。帝修反的日子一天比一天不好过。
    各国人民革命运动的蓬勃发展表明，国际形势一片大好，而且越来越好。敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，热烈欢呼并且坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。我们深信，各国人民通过英勇的持久的斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利！　直属排　雷　鸣
    红旗卷起农奴戟
    亚非拉民族解放运动在深入发展
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大地区，是世界人民同帝国主义及其走狗激烈搏斗的主要战场。战后以来，亚非拉人民革命运动不断高涨，给以美国为首的帝国主义极其沉重的打击。目前，亚非拉人民的民族解放运动正在深入发展。
    在亚非拉，革命群众运动越来越广泛地展开着。拉丁美洲人民的斗争怒涛汹涌澎湃。不久前墨西哥学生的反迫害、反屠杀斗争，震撼了美帝国主义的后院。在菲律宾、土耳其等许多受美帝严密控制的国家，也相继爆发了规模巨大的反美斗争。这些事实表明了亚非拉人民同美帝国主义的矛盾的进一步尖锐化。
    毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想，在亚非拉日益深入人心。革命武装斗争的烈火，在亚非拉广大地区燃烧着。在东南亚不少国家里，人民武装力量按照毛主席关于农村包围城市的伟大理论，深入农村，广泛发动农民群众，建立农村根据地，开展武装斗争。这些国家，农民占人口的绝大多数，他们苦大仇深，强烈要求革命，是民族民主革命的主力军。红旗卷起农奴戟。千千万万农民动员起来，组织起来，武装起来，用枪杆子同帝国主义及其走狗进行战斗，这是亚非拉人民革命斗争的胜利道路。

    倒海翻江卷巨澜
    欧洲北美人民斗争风暴不断兴起
    倒海翻江卷巨澜。人民斗争的风暴，正在猛烈地冲击着整个欧洲、北美。
    今年春天美国爆发的席卷一百几十个城市的黑人抗暴斗争，把美国人民斗争推向了一个新的高潮。目前，美国黑人运动正在重新集结力量；美国工人运动和学生运动也呈现了一个新的局面。
    法国人民在今年五月掀起的战后以来空前未有的大规模群众革命斗争，有着十分深远的影响。在这以后，人民斗争浪潮在西欧国家此伏彼起，一浪接一浪，最近意大利又掀起了声势浩大的革命群众运动。这些国家的工人运动和学生运动正在日益紧密地结合起来，农民群众也越来越广泛地参加了斗争的行列。
    人民斗争的风暴扩及帝国主义的心脏地带欧洲、北美，这是以美国为首的帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现，是国际垄断资产阶级反动统治日益不稳的一个重要标志。同时，这又沉重地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义，使它们更深地陷入不可解脱的危机之中。
    欧洲、北美人民已经觉醒了。经过革命斗争烈火的锻炼，他们必将进一步提高觉悟，加强团结，壮大自己的力量；并且同亚非拉人民和全世界革命人民紧密地携起手来，共同战斗，向腐朽的帝国主义和资本主义制度发动更猛烈的进攻。

    大地微微暖气吹
    苏联东欧人民吹响了战斗的号角
    战斗的号角，在现代修正主义统治下的苏联和东欧一些国家，已经吹响了！
    最近苏联“斯大林小组”散发了一张传单，号召苏联无产阶级和劳动人民起来推翻苏修叛徒集团的反动统治，重建无产阶级专政。这个振奋人心的革命呼声，反映了苏联人民的共同意志，表达了苏联人民的战斗誓言。
    苏修叛徒集团全面复辟资本主义，使工人阶级和劳动人民又吃二遍苦。这伙叛徒胡说什么今天的苏联已经成为“全民国家”，实际上在现代修正主义统治下的苏联，阶级矛盾空前急剧地发展着。苏联工人阶级和劳动人民一定要起来同骑在他们头上的新的资产阶级进行英勇顽强的斗争。目前苏联革命人民斗争的星星之火，一定会发展成燎原的烈焰。这是阶级斗争发展的必然规律。
    在苏修控制的东欧，捷克斯洛伐克人民反对苏修武装占领的斗争一直没有停止。苏修叛徒集团的几十万军队，不仅吓不倒捷克斯洛伐克人民，反而动员了捷克斯洛伐克人民和东欧各国人民，奋起进行反对苏修控制的斗争。
    高天滚滚寒流急，大地微微暖气吹。苏修在国内加紧实行法西斯统治，在国外加紧推行社会帝国主义政策；但是，苏联人民是要革命的，东欧各国人民是要革命的。他们正在积蓄力量，准备斗争。“修正主义的统治是不会长久的”。毛主席这个伟大的预言，必将被历史的发展所证实。
                      活版连队工人　刘兰菊
    百万工农齐踊跃
    结成广泛统一战线反对美帝苏修
    世界各国人民的斗争，都是互相鼓舞、互相支持的。今天，亚非拉人民的革命运动，欧洲、北美人民的革命运动，苏联、东欧人民的革命运动，虽然有着各自的斗争目标，但是汇成了一股浩浩荡荡的革命洪流，有力地打击着美帝和苏修。
    美帝和苏修加紧勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界和划分势力范围，来主宰世界局势，推行新殖民主义。他们合伙镇压各国人民的革命斗争，有时是暗中默契，有时是公开配合。这两个世界人民最凶恶的敌人，在干反革命勾当时完全穿着连裆裤。在这种形势下，反对美帝和反对苏修的斗争更加紧密地联结在一起；反对美帝必然要反对苏修，反对苏修也必然要反对美帝。
    美帝和苏修加紧反革命的勾结，促使世界人民日益加强革命的团结。一切被美帝、苏修和他们的走狗所压迫的人民，只有结成一个广泛的统一战线，才能彻底粉碎美帝、苏修妄图霸占世界的罪恶阴谋，才能取得自己的胜利和解放。现在，越来越多的人已经认识了这个真理。百万工农齐踊跃。各国无产阶级和广大人民正在更加紧密地携起手来，共同战斗。一个反对美帝、苏修的新的伟大的斗争高潮正在到来！

    纸船明烛照天烧
    美帝苏修彻底完蛋的日子不远了
    目前，美帝和苏修加紧勾结，采用武装镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手，竭力要想把世界各地熊熊燃烧的人民斗争的烈火扑灭下去。他们的这种疯狂反扑，使当前国际形势出现了一股反革命逆流。但是，逆流终究不会变为主流。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝和苏修的疯狂反扑，决不表明他们的强大，而恰恰表明他们的极端虚弱，表明他们的日暮途穷。
    美帝是纸老虎，苏修是纸老虎，美帝和苏修加在一起仍然是纸老虎。他们穷凶极恶，张牙舞爪，虽然也能吓倒革命队伍中一些不坚定的人，但是，独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。广大革命人民敢于蔑视这两个庞然大物，一定要把斗争继续下去。
    历史的车轮是不会倒转的。各国人民的革命运动中尽管可能出现这样那样的曲折，但是已经觉悟起来的人民，必将推动历史的车轮滚滚向前。他们通过英勇的持久的斗争，必将取得彻底的胜利。
    纸船明烛照天烧。美帝和苏修这两个世界人民的公敌彻底完蛋的日子已经不远了！
