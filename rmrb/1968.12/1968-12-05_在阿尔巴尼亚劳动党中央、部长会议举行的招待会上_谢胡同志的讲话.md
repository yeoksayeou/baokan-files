The glorious Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army have sent a delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng to participate in the celebration of the 24th anniversary of our country's liberation from fascist bondage. This is a great honor for the Albanian people, and we are very pleased.

Please allow me to express, on behalf of the Albanian people, our Party, our government, and our armed forces, our heartfelt respect and gratitude to the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng.

We are particularly pleased that the delegation to our country is led by the Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrade Huang Yongsheng. Let all the external enemies of Albania, whether those who fly the flag of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or those who fly the flag of the Warsaw Pact, know that the friendship between Albania and China is not only manifested in the fraternal internationalist relations in the ideological, political, and economic spheres, but also in the military sphere. Marxism-Leninism unites us, and our two glorious parties and our glorious leaders—Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha—unite us.

The friendship between our two peoples, parties, and countries is unbreakable because it is built on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "The fraternal, rock-solid friendship between our Party, our government, and our people with the Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the people of China will last forever. Neither vast distances nor mountains and seas can stop us. Whether in good times or difficult times, we will always be together like brothers, because our unity and friendship are built on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

Dear Comrade Huang Yongsheng, your visit to our country is a great help to our people and greatly contributes to further strengthening the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples, parties, and armies.

The whole world can see that the relationship between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Albania is the correct relationship that should exist between socialist countries. Our relationship and great friendship expose modern revisionism. The Albanian people and their Party are proud of their great fighting friendship with the great Chinese people and the Communist Party of China.

The Albanian people and their Party are particularly concerned about the entire glorious path taken by the great People's Republic of China under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought and teachings, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great success and won brilliant victories. Except for Taiwan Province, which is still occupied by American imperialism, revolutionary committees have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Our people and Party warmly congratulate the brotherly Chinese people on their great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The cause of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great cause. It has great historical significance not only for China but also for the fate of socialism and revolution in the world. The ultimate goal of this revolution is to defend and continuously strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, to carry the socialist revolution to the end, to avoid the emergence of modern revisionism, and to prevent the restoration of capitalism as in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries.

Comrade Mao Zedong has established great historical achievements. Comrade Mao Zedong, with his Marxist-Leninist foresight, initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making it possible to rally hundreds of millions of Chinese people, the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals to resolutely smash the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, ensuring the decisive victory of this great revolution.

The dream of American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to make the great China deviate from the socialist path and take the capitalist road through the revisionist actions of Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary accomplices in various parts of China has been forever shattered and buried.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held about a month ago, is a great event of great historical significance for the Chinese people, the Chinese revolution, and the fate of socialism. Its importance goes beyond the borders of China. This plenary session summarized the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, adopted a resolution to expel the traitor Liu Shaoqi from the Party and revoke all his Party and state positions, and at the same time set a great task for the entire Party, the working class, and all the Chinese people to fully and comprehensively develop the victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Based on the instructions and teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and the historic resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, hundreds of millions of Chinese revolutionary masses are fighting victoriously to implement these resolutions and instructions. They strive to further carry out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, to ensure that the working class truly leads all sectors and all fields of work, to continuously strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, to carry out a revolution in education, to clean up the class ranks, to implement the latest Party instructions, and so on. Of particular significance is that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee believes that after the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the conditions have been prepared in terms of ideology and organization to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Party at an appropriate time.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great People's Republic of China is stronger than ever. The brilliant achievements of the great People's Republic of China in all aspects of life make her friends happy and her enemies at home and abroad angry. The Albanian people are extremely delighted with the great victories and achievements of the Chinese people, regarding these victories and achievements as their own, and wishing the brotherly Chinese people greater victories.

Today, the great People's Republic of China has become a powerful socialist country with developed modern industry, advanced socialist agriculture, and modern science and technology. It has a glorious, invincible army and a powerful defensive force capable of dealing with and smashing any invaders or alliance of invaders.

The People's Republic of China enjoys great international prestige. It firmly and sincerely supports and aids the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism, as well as the great class struggle of the proletariat in capitalist countries.

The great victories of the Chinese people in all aspects of life are the result of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people implementing the Marxist-Leninist teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong.

Comrades, friends:

The international situation is developing in a direction favorable to revolution and socialism and unfavorable to imperialism and modern revisionism. Now, we are in a new stage of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. The national liberation and revolutionary forces of the world are rising up against the oppression of imperialism and revisionism. Imperialism is accelerating its irreversible process of disintegration, while the Soviet Union has been turned into a militaristic and imperialist country by the revisionist ruling clique, which has launched open aggression and aroused great hatred from the peoples of all countries.

Within the imperialist camp, the antagonistic contradictions between labor and capital have become extremely sharp, driving the youth, students, and workers in various capitalist countries to launch an irresistible wave of demonstrations, strikes, and boycotts. Economic, financial, political, and military crises have become permanent companions in the development of the situation in these countries. The revolutionary movements and national liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries are developing deeply. The situation of the American imperialists is desperate. No force can save American imperialism from weakness, decay, and its inevitable doom.

Within the so-called "family" of countries ruled by revisionists, that is, within the revisionist camp, serious crises have also occurred. No matter what methods the revisionists adopt, they cannot escape their shameful doom. The revisionist camp is like a ship full of holes. Water is flowing into this revisionist wreck, and it will definitely sink. Revisionism, which has committed countless crimes against socialism and revolution, will definitely be buried, just as imperialism will definitely be buried. The Albanian people and their Party of Labour firmly believe that true Bolsheviks and the Soviet people will rise up, as in the Great October Socialist Revolution, to defeat and eliminate the revisionist clique that has betrayed and sucked their blood, and bring the Soviet Union back to the path of Lenin and Stalin. This day is not far off. In this regard, they can learn from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The Soviet revisionists' military aggression against the brotherly Czech people marks the appearance of the Soviet Union as an aggressor country, a new imperialist on the international stage, where fascist military thought begins to dominate. This aggression has made the international situation extremely tense, especially because it was carried out in collusion with the United States. Due to the Soviet-American collusion, the great conspiracy against the Vietnamese people has been further intensified.

A new and extremely serious factor has entered the international situation, which is the open declaration of the Soviet revisionists on "legitimate rights." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique claims to have "legitimate rights" to intervene militarily in other socialist countries without any invitation, under the pretext of "protecting the socialist cause from imperialist threats," just as this clique did in Czechoslovakia. This is imperialist and fascist rhetoric, the rhetoric of Mussolini's fascist regime in the 1926 treaty with the Zogu feudal regime. In this treaty, Mussolini stipulated a "legitimate right" that whenever he deemed the domestic situation of the Albanian government at the time "threatened" or the interests of fascist Italy threatened, that is, whenever he deemed it necessary, he could intervene in Albania. It was precisely based on this fascist rhetoric that Mussolini occupied Albania on April 7, 1939. The Khrushchev clique in Moscow also occupied Czechoslovakia on August 21, 1968, based on the same fascist rhetoric.

Therefore, the Soviet revisionists' military occupation of Czechoslovakia has sounded the alarm for the peoples of all countries: the Soviet Union has become a country of social imperialism and social fascism, threatening the independence of other peoples, just like American imperialism.

Now, imperialism and revisionism are plotting new conspiracies against the brotherly Vietnamese people. This conspiracy is the result of the Soviet revisionists' aggression against Czechoslovakia: in exchange for Czechoslovakia, the Soviet revisionists have sold out Vietnam to American imperialism. However, the Albanian people and the Party of Labour of Albania believe that the brotherly Vietnamese people will not kneel before the great conspiracy of the Americans and Soviet revisionists. The heroic Vietnamese people will not decide the fate of their epic struggle at the Paris conference table but on the battlefields of Vietnam.

Faced with this situation that threatens the freedom and sovereignty of the peoples of various countries, the peoples of all countries and all true revolutionaries, if they want to avoid the fate of Czechoslovakia or Vietnam, must rise up and unite around the fighting anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist common front. In the face of the total crisis of imperialism and modern revisionism, the Americans and Soviet revisionists are like two wounded beasts, in extreme pain, and before their death, they will, if possible, try to devour the neighboring peoples and nations at any time and place. The peoples who love freedom must unite around the fighting anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist front, and this must first be done by establishing friendship with the great people of Mao Zedong's China, because the People's Republic of China is the main force and pillar of the international anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist front.

Comrades, friends:

Standing at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, together with the great Chinese people, the peoples of other countries, and revolutionary forces in the world, are the Albanian people under the correct leadership of the Party of Labour of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Our people are working and fighting. We are building socialism at high speed. We have established an invincible defensive force capable of dealing with any external aggression, no matter where it comes from—from the aggressive forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the aggressive forces of the Warsaw Pact, or any other forces.

The People's Republic of Albania's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist policy of the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists are furious, especially because we chose the moment of their aggression against Czechoslovakia to announce our withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. They accuse us of falling into the position of imperialists. Yes, the People's Republic of Albania deliberately and calmly chose this moment to announce its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. Albania announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact precisely at the most critical moment of the Soviet revisionists, to give them the heaviest blow at the moment of their most serious crisis, to tear off their masks, and to expose their faces as aggressors; at the same time, to support the brotherly Czech people at the most critical moment in contemporary history. Those who have fallen into the position of imperialists are not us, but they, the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria, who have long since taken the capitalist road, betrayed, and become the most fervent allies of American imperialism. Now they appear on the international stage as treacherous aggressors against socialist countries.

We are well aware of the conspiracies plotted by American imperialists and Soviet revisionist traitors against the People's Republic of Albania. Nothing in the past and present escapes the revolutionary vigilance of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people. We are prepared to deal with any situation. The Albanian people will not welcome any invaders with flowers, no matter whether these invaders are revisionists or imperialists. They will welcome the invaders with gun barrels, as Comrade Enver Hoxha said, they will give a crushing blow to the invaders, and Albania will become the grave of any invaders. We have set ourselves the task of completely and thoroughly annihilating any invader who dares to attack our country's borders and set foot on our sacred soil, not allowing them to escape alive from here. The Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people say what they do and do what they say.

Moreover, those who might launch an aggression against Albania should not forget that the cause of the Albanian people is the cause of all revolutionary peoples in the world. They should not forget, in particular, the power of the great Albanian-Chinese friendship. They must remember that an armed attack on Albania cannot be limited to Albanian territory. At that time, the flames of war will cross all borders and spread to the lairs of the aggressors.

Our revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact has been supported worldwide. At these historic moments, the great Chinese people and the great Mao Zedong have become even closer to the Albanian people. The leaders of the Chinese people, in their telegram to the leaders of Albania, have clearly and forcefully proclaimed to the whole world: "If American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will face only complete, shameful, and irreversible failure."

Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, in their congratulatory telegrams to our leaders on the occasion of our national day a few days ago, once again strongly and clearly proclaimed to the whole world: "We once again declare to you: the 700 million Chinese people, after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Albanian people. At any time and under any circumstances, we will firmly support your anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle."

These historic declarations vividly reflect the great Albanian-Chinese friendship and internationalist unity, like bombs falling on the heads of our enemies, and once again confirm the truly internationalist position of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong. We, the Albanian people, and all revolutionaries around the world who stand with us, thank the great People's Republic of China and Comrade Mao Zedong for this steadfast internationalist attitude.

Comrades of the Chinese delegation:

During your visit to our country, you have seen with your own eyes how our people, with great enthusiasm and revolutionary will, strive to complete the tasks set by the Fourth Five-Year Plan and implement the Marxist-Leninist line of our Party.

Today, the characteristic of our country's life is that the working masses, with great revolutionary enthusiasm, strive to realize the grand program of the Fifth Party Congress and implement the teachings of our Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha on further revolutionizing all aspects of national life. Our Party has always followed the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line of building socialism with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun, relying on our own efforts.

The Albanian people are building socialism in this corner of the Balkan Peninsula on the Adriatic Sea and have achieved great successes. Socialist Albania is like a small island in the imperialist and revisionist sea of Europe. The socialist beacon on our Albanian island will never be extinguished, no matter how the waves beat against our shores or how dark the clouds gather over our country. No force can stop us from doing what we want to do at home, that is, building socialism and communism.

We do not attack anyone. The People's Republic of Albania, as always, will pursue a policy of good neighborliness, advocating the establishment of normal relations with all countries, regardless of their social system. However, the People's Republic of Albania will never allow anyone to interfere in the internal affairs of the Albanian people.

In the cause of building socialism, our people have also always received fraternal internationalist aid from the brotherly Chinese people. This aid has never been interrupted and has always been generous, multifaceted, and effective. Recently, when the economic delegation of our government, led by Comrade Adil Çarçani, visited China, the People's Republic of China provided us with economic aid, which also proves this. This aid is of great significance not only in quantity but also in political content and high quality. This aid will help the rapid and powerful development of Albania's productive forces, further strengthen our economic independence, develop existing industrial sectors, and establish powerful industrial sectors, further strongly promote the development of industrial and agricultural production.

A few days ago, the People's Republic of China provided long-term loan aid to the People's Republic of Albania. According to this aid, our country will build several very important industrial projects in a relatively short period, such as a metallurgical complex that processes 800,000 tons of nickel ore per year, an integrated refinery that processes 1 million tons of crude oil per year, a powerful hydroelectric power station with a capacity of about 400,000 kilowatts on the Drin River in Fier, doubling the production of nitrogen fertilizers, expanding a phosphate fertilizer plant, building a chemical plant for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, a comprehensive printing plant, a plastic factory, expanding a tractor parts factory, establishing many chromite, copper, coal, and asbestos ore beneficiation plants, building other factories, building several new large mines, providing equipment for further mechanization of geological work, mines, construction, and agriculture, providing equipment needed to strengthen the merchant fleet, and expanding comprehensive geological surveys, and so on.

I take this opportunity to express, on behalf of our people, our Party, and our government, our gratitude and deepest thanks to the brotherly Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong for providing us with this very precious internationalist aid, as they have always done. The Albanian people will forever be grateful to them.

Our people and our Party are unremittingly carrying out the revolution, striving to further deepen the ideological revolution, carry out class struggle in the interests of the working class, further revolutionize Party life, improve work methods and styles, intensify the struggle against bureaucracy, further revolutionize education, strengthen the supervision of the working class, achieve the complete liberation of women, thoroughly implement the mass line, emphasize proletarian politics, continue to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry out a scientific and technological revolution, gradually narrow the gaps between urban and rural areas, between industry and agriculture, and between mental and manual labor, and so on. The ultimate goal of the movement to revolutionize all aspects of national life is to carry the socialist revolution to the end in all fields of life, further improve socialist production relations, develop productive forces, continuously improve the superstructure, and prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism.

Not long ago, when our country withdrew from the Warsaw Pact, a heroic spirit of battle readiness burst forth throughout Albania, and revolutionary vigilance reached an unprecedented height to defend the revolution and socialist victories of Albania and to defend our country's borders from any possible aggression by imperialists or revisionists. The Albanian people, united as one around the Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, have turned their country into an impregnable socialist fortress. Any enemy who dares to touch it will meet with doom.

Dear comrades of the Chinese delegation:

Your visit is about to end, and you will soon return to your own country. I take this opportunity to convey, on behalf of the people, Party, and government of our country, our most revolutionary greetings and pure friendship and fighting unity to the brotherly Chinese people, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, to our most beloved friend Chairman Mao Zedong, to his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and to Comrade Zhou Enlai.

Finally, I am convinced that the visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, will further strengthen the eternal fighting friendship between our two peoples, parties, and armies.

Please allow me to raise my glass:

To the great, unbreakable fighting friendship between our people and the more than 700 million brotherly Chinese people,
To the heroic Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China,
To the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, our most beloved friend, and great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong,
To the final, comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
To the health of Comrade Lin Biao, the closest comrade-in-arms of Comrade Mao Zedong,
To the Government of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Zhou Enlai,
To the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army,
To the health of Comrade Huang Yongsheng and all members of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation,
To the health of all guests attending this reception,
To the victory of Marxism-Leninism,
Cheers!

    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央、部长会议举行的招待会上
    谢胡同志的讲话
    新华社地拉那三日电　穆罕默德·谢胡同志二日在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、部长会议为中国党政军代表团举行的招待会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的黄永胜同志，亲爱的中国党政军代表团的同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    光荣的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和英雄的中国人民解放军派遣以黄永胜同志为首的代表团，参加我们祖国从法西斯枷锁下获得解放二十四周年这一伟大节日，这是阿尔巴尼亚人民十分荣幸的事，阿尔巴尼亚人民感到非常高兴。
    请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、我们党、我国政府和我国军队向以黄永胜同志为首的中国党政军代表团表示衷心的敬意和感谢。
    我们特别感到高兴的是，率领中国代表团的是中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜同志。让阿尔巴尼亚所有的外部敌人，不论是那些打着北大西洋公约组织旗号的敌人，还是那些打着华沙条约旗号的敌人，都知道阿尔巴尼亚和中国之间的友谊不仅表现在意识形态、政治和经济方面的兄弟的国际主义关系，而且还表现在军事方面的兄弟的国际主义关系。马克思列宁主义把我们联结在一起，我们两个光荣的党和我们光荣的领袖——毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志把我们联结在一起。
    我们两国人民、两党和两国之间的友谊是牢不可破的，因为这种友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的牢固的基础上的。恩维尔·霍查同志说：“我们党、我国政府和我国人民同中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民结成的兄弟般的、坚如磐石的友谊将万古长青。不管是迢迢万里，还是高山和海洋，都阻挡不住我们。不管在美好的日子里还是困难的日子里，我们将象亲兄弟一样永远在一起，因为我们的团结和友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的牢固基础上的。”
    亲爱的黄永胜同志，你们访问我国，是对我国人民的一个巨大帮助，大大有助于进一步加强我们两国人民，两党和两国军队之间的牢不可破的友谊。
    全世界看得出，人民中国同阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的关系就是社会主义国家之间必须有的正确关系。我们两国之间的关系和伟大友谊使现代修正主义暴露无遗。阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的党为他们同伟大的中国人民和中国共产党的伟大的战斗友谊而感到自豪。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的党，特别关心地注视着以伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的英雄的中国共产党领导下的伟大的人民中国所走过的整个光荣的道路。在毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想和教导的指引下，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的成功，取得了辉煌的胜利，除仍被美帝国主义霸占的台湾省外，全国二十九个省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会。我国人民和党热烈地祝贺兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命的事业是伟大的事业，它不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界的社会主义和革命的命运都具有重大的历史意义。这个革命的最终目标是保卫和进一步不断加强中国的无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，避免产生现代修正主义，避免出现象苏联和东欧其他国家那样的资本主义复辟的情况。
    毛泽东同志建立了具有历史意义的丰功伟绩。毛泽东同志英明地以马克思列宁主义的远见发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，从而才有可能唤起亿万中国群众、工人阶级、贫下中农、人民解放军、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子去坚决粉碎以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，保证了这场大革命的决定性胜利。
    美帝国主义者和苏修叛徒集团，企图通过刘少奇及其在中国各地的反革命同伙的修正主义行径，使伟大的中国脱离社会主义道路而走上资本主义道路的迷梦，已经被永远打破和埋葬。
    一个月以前召开的中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会，对于中国人民、中国革命和社会主义的命运来说，是具有重要的历史意义的一个伟大事件，而且其重要意义超越了中国的国界。这次全会对无产阶级文化大革命的胜利作了总结，通过了关于把叛徒刘少奇永远开除出党和撤消其党内外的一切职务的决议，同时给全党、工人阶级和全体中国人民规定了使无产阶级文化大革命所取得的胜利得以充分和全面的发展的伟大任务。
    亿万中国革命人民群众，根据毛泽东同志的指示和教导、根据第八届扩大的十二中全会的历史性决议，正在为贯彻执行这些决议和指示而胜利地进行斗争，以便进一步实现斗、批、改的任务，使工人阶级对一切部门、一切工作领域真正进行全面的领导，使无产阶级专政得到全面的不断的加强，在教育方面也在开展一场革命，同时清理阶级队伍，贯彻执行关于党的最新指示，等等。特别具有重大意义的是，第八届扩大的十二中全会认为，经过无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，已经从思想上和组织上为在适当的时候召开党的第九次全国代表大会准备了条件。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命，伟大的人民中国比以往任何时候更加强大了。伟大的人民中国在生活的一切领域中所取得的辉煌成就使她的朋友都感到高兴，而使她的国内外敌人感到恼火。阿尔巴尼亚人民为中国人民所取得的伟大胜利和成就感到万分喜悦，把这些胜利和成就看作是自己的胜利和成就，并祝兄弟的中国人民取得日益巨大的胜利。
    今天，伟大的人民中国已经成为一个具有发达的现代工业、先进的社会主义农业和现代科学技术的强大的社会主义国家，她拥有一支光荣的战无不胜的军队，拥有一支足以对付和粉碎一切侵略者或者侵略者联盟的强大的防御力量。
    中华人民共和国享有巨大的国际威望。她坚决而真诚地支持和援助亚非拉人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争以及资本主义国家无产阶级的伟大的革命的阶级斗争。
    中国人民在生活的各个方面所取得的伟大胜利，是中国共产党和中国人民落实毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义教导的结果。
    同志们，朋友们：
    国际形势正在朝着有利于革命和社会主义，不利于帝国主义和现代修正主义的方向发展。现在，我们正处在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争的一个新阶段，世界上的民族解放和革命力量正在起来反对帝国主义和修正主义压迫，帝国主义正在加速其无法挽回的分崩离析的过程，而苏联已经被修正主义统治集团搞成一个军国主义和帝国主义国家，它发动了公开侵略，激起了各国人民对它的极大仇恨。
    在帝国主义阵营里，劳资之间的对抗性矛盾空前地尖锐化，促使各资本主义国家里的青年、学生和工人掀起了示威游行和罢课、罢工的不可抗拒的浪潮。经济、财政、政治和军事的危机已成为这些国家形势发展中的永久的伴侣。各国人民的革命运动和民族解放斗争正在深入发展。美帝国主义者的处境危急。没有任何力量能使美帝国主义免于衰弱、腐朽和更加接近其不可挽回的灭亡。
    在由修正主义者当权的国家组成的所谓“大家庭”中，也就是说在修正主义集团中，也发生了严重的危机。修正主义者不论采取什么做法，也逃脱不了他们的可耻的灭亡。修正主义集团象一条百孔千疮的破船。水正在流到这条修正主义破船里去，它一定会沉没。修正主义由于对社会主义和革命犯下了累累罪行，一定会被埋葬，正象帝国主义一定会被埋葬一样。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其劳动党深信，真正的布尔什维克和苏联人民会象在伟大十月社会主义革命时一样，奋起打败和消灭背叛他们和吸他们的血的修正主义集团，使苏联重新回到列宁和斯大林的道路上，这个日子已为期不远了。在这方面，他们是可以从中国的无产阶级文化大革命中学到东西的。
    苏修及其仆从对捷克斯洛伐克兄弟人民的军事侵略，标志着苏联作为一个侵略国，作为一个新的帝国主义出现在国际舞台上，在这个新的帝国主义的领导集团中，法西斯性质的军事思想开始占统治地位。这场侵略使国际局势变得严重地尖锐起来，这尤其是因为这场侵略是在苏美勾结的情况下进行的。由于苏美勾结，对越南人民的大阴谋也进一步加紧进行了。
    一个后果极其严重的新因素进入了国际局势，这就是苏修发表的关于“合法权利”的公开声明，苏修叛徒集团自称拥有“合法权利”，在没有任何人的邀请下，以“使社会主义事业免遭帝国主义威胁”为由，可以在军事上干涉其他社会主义国家，就象这个集团对捷克斯洛伐克所干的那样。这是帝国主义和法西斯的论调，这是索古封建政权和墨索里尼法西斯政权于一九二六年缔结的条约中出现的墨索里尼的论调。在这一条约中，墨索里尼规定了一项“合法权利”，只要他认为当时的阿尔巴尼亚政权的国内局势“受到威胁”，或者法西斯意大利的利益受到威胁的时候，换句话说，他什么时候认为需要，就可以对阿尔巴尼亚进行干涉。墨索里尼正是根据这一法西斯论调，于一九三九年四月七日占领了阿尔巴尼亚。莫斯科赫鲁晓夫集团也是根据同样的法西斯论调，于一九六八年八月二十一日占领了捷克斯洛伐克。
    因此，苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的军事占领为世界各国人民敲起了警钟：苏联已经变成一个社会帝国主义和社会法西斯国家，它象美帝国主义一样威胁着其他各国人民的独立。
    现在，帝国主义和修正主义正在策划反对兄弟的越南人民的新阴谋。这个阴谋是苏修对捷克斯洛伐克进行侵略的结果：为了换取捷克斯洛伐克，苏修把越南出卖给美帝国主义。但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党相信，兄弟的越南人民是不会在美帝和苏修的大阴谋面前屈膝的，英雄的越南人民将不是在巴黎会议桌上，而是在越南的战场上决定他们的传奇式的斗争的命运。
    面对这种威胁各国人民的自由和主权的情况，世界各国人民和一切真正的革命派，如果要使自己避免捷克斯洛伐克或越南的遭遇，就必须奋起团结在战斗的反帝反修共同阵线周围。在帝国主义和现代修正主义陷于总危机的情况下，美帝和苏修就象两只受伤的野兽，它们正处于极度痛楚之中，在它们死亡之前，只要可能，它们将随时随地千方百计地并吞邻近的各国人民和民族。爱好自由的各国人民要在战斗的反帝反修阵线的周围联合起来，这首先要同毛泽东的伟大的中国人民建立友谊，因为人民中国是国际反帝反修阵线的主力和支柱。
      同志们，朋友们：
    站在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争的最前线的，同伟大的中国人民、世界上其他各国人民和革命力量站在一起的，还有以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正确领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民。
    我国人民在劳动，在战斗。我们在高速度地建设社会主义，我们已建立了不可战胜的防御力量，能够对付任何外来的侵略，不管这种侵略来自何方——来自北大西洋公约组织侵略势力，来自华沙条约侵略势力，还是来自任何其他势力。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国宣布退出华沙条约，使自己摆脱这个条约所带来的任何义务，这给了苏修帝国主义政策以沉重的打击。苏修恼羞成怒，特别是因为我们选择了他们侵略捷克斯洛伐克的时刻宣布退出华沙条约，他们指责我们所谓陷入了帝国主义者的立场。是的，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国有意地、冷静地选择这个时刻宣布退出华沙条约。阿尔巴尼亚正是在苏修的最关键的时刻宣布退出华沙条约，以便在他们处于最严重的危机的时刻给予他们以最沉重的打击，扯下他们的假面具，使他们暴露侵略者的面目；同时在兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民处于当代历史上最关键的时候，给予他们以支援。陷入帝国主义立场的，不是我们，而是他们，苏修及其仆从波兰、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和保加利亚，他们早已走上了资本主义道路，叛变了，成了美帝的最狂热的同盟者，现在已经作为反对社会主义国家的阴险的侵略者出现在国际舞台上。
    我们清楚地知道美帝国主义者和苏修叛徒集团对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国策划的阴谋。任何事情过去和现在都逃不过阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命警惕性。我们准备应付任何局势。阿尔巴尼亚人民是不会捧着鲜花来欢迎任何侵略者的，不管这些侵略者是什么样的修正主义者还是帝国主义者，他们将用枪杆子来迎接侵略者，正如恩维尔·霍查同志所说的，他们将迎头痛击侵略者，阿尔巴尼亚将成为任何侵略者的坟墓。我们给自己规定的任务是，谁胆敢作为侵略者来袭击我们祖国的边境并踏上我们神圣的国土，那就全部、彻底消灭它，不让它活着从这里逃走。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民是说得到，做得到的。
    此外，那些可能对阿尔巴尼亚发动侵略的人不要忘记，阿尔巴尼亚人民的事业就是世界上所有革命人民的事业，他们尤其不要忘记伟大的阿中友谊的威力，他们必须记住，对阿尔巴尼亚的武装进攻是不可能局限于阿尔巴尼亚境内的，到那个时候，战火就会越过所有边界，蔓延到侵略者的巢穴。
    我国退出华沙条约的革命行动，在世界各地得到支持。在这些历史性的时刻里，伟大的中国人民和伟大的毛泽东与阿尔巴尼亚人民比以往更加亲近了。中国人民的领导人在给阿尔巴尼亚领导人的电报中十分清楚而有力地向全世界宣告：“如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”
    毛泽东同志、林彪同志和周恩来同志，在前几天我国国庆节的时候，向我们的领导人发来的贺电中，又再一次有力地和非常明确地向全世界宣告：“我们再次向你们表示：经过无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将坚定不移地支持你们的反帝反修斗争。”
    这些具有历史意义的声明，生动地表现了伟大的阿中友谊和国际主义的团结，象炸弹一样落在我们敌人头上，并且再次证实了中国共产党和毛泽东同志的真正国际主义的立场。我们阿尔巴尼亚人民，和我们一道的全世界的所有革命者，都感谢伟大的人民中国和毛泽东同志的这种坚定不移的国际主义态度。
    中国代表团的同志们：
    你们在我国访问期间亲眼看到了我国人民以怎样的热情和革命毅力来努力完成第四个五年计划所规定的各项任务，贯彻执行我们党的马克思列宁主义路线。
    今天我国生活的特点，是劳动群众以巨大的革命热情努力实现第五次党代表大会的宏伟纲领，努力实现党和恩维尔·霍查同志关于使国家生活进一步全面革命化的教导。我们党一贯遵循一手拿镐，一手拿枪，自力更生建设社会主义的马克思列宁主义革命路线。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民正在亚得里亚海沿岸巴尔干半岛的这一角建设社会主义，并取得了伟大的成就。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚象是帝国主义和修正主义欧洲海洋上的一个小岛。在我们阿尔巴尼亚岛上的这盏社会主义明灯永远不会熄灭，不管海潮怎样冲击我们的堤岸，也不管在我国上空怎样布满乌云。没有任何力量能阻止我们在国内做我们所要做的事情，即建设社会主义和共产主义。
    我们不攻击任何人。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一如既往，将奉行睦邻的外交政策，她主张同一切国家建立正常关系，不论其社会制度如何。但是阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国决不容许任何人干涉阿尔巴尼亚人民的内政。
    我国人民在建设社会主义的事业中，也一直得到兄弟的中国人民的兄弟般的国际主义援助。对我们的这种援助，从来没有中断过，始终是慷慨的、多方面的和卓有成效的。最近以阿迪尔·查尔查尼同志为首我国政府经济代表团访问中国的时候，中华人民共和国所给予我们的经济援助，也证明了这一点。这种援助不仅在数量方面，而且在政治内容和高质量方面，都具有非常重大的意义。这种援助将有助于阿尔巴尼亚的生产力进一步迅猛的发展，进一步增强我国的经济独立，发展现有的工业部门和建立强大的工业部门，进一步有力地推动工农业生产的发展。
    前些日子，中华人民共和国向阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国提供了长期贷款援助，根据这种援助，我国将在比较短的时期内建成一些非常重要的工业项目，例如，建设一个每年处理八十万吨镍铁矿石的冶金联合企业、一座每年加工一百万吨原油的综合炼油厂，在德林河上的菲尔兹建设一座发电能力为四十万瓩左右的强大的水电站，使氮肥产量翻一番，扩建一座磷肥工厂，建设一座生产氯碱的化学工厂、一个综合印刷厂、一座塑料制品厂，扩建一座拖拉机配件厂，建立许多座铬矿、铜矿、煤和石棉的选矿工厂，建设其他许多工厂，建设一些新的巨大的矿井，提供地质工作、矿井、建筑业和农业进一步机械化的设备，提供为加强商船队所需要的设备以及将扩大综合的地质调查工作等等。
    我借此机会，代表我国人民、我们的党和我国政府，向兄弟的中国人民，向光荣的中国共产党，向中华人民共和国政府，向毛泽东同志，表示感激和最衷心的谢意，感谢他们象他们一向所做的那样，这次又给我们提供了非常宝贵的国际主义援助。阿尔巴尼亚人民将永远感谢他们。
    我国人民和我们的党正在坚持不懈地开展革命，他们努力奋斗，以进一步深入开展思想革命，按照工人阶级的利益开展阶级斗争，使党内生活进一步革命化，改进工作方法和工作作风，深入开展反对官僚主义的斗争，使教育进一步革命化，加强工人阶级的监督，使妇女获得彻底解放，最彻底地执行群众路线，突出无产阶级政治，继续加强无产阶级专政，开展科学技术革命，逐步缩小城乡之间、工农业之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别等等。使国家生活全面革命化的运动的最终目标是，在一切生活领域中把社会主义革命进行到底，进一步改进社会主义生产关系，发展生产力，不断改进上层建筑，使阿尔巴尼亚避免出现修正主义和资本主义复辟。
    前不久，在我国退出华沙条约的时候，在阿尔巴尼亚全国迸发出了战斗准备的豪迈精神，革命警惕性空前提高，以保卫阿尔巴尼亚的革命和社会主义的胜利，以保卫我们祖国边境不受来自帝国主义者或修正主义者的任何可能的侵略。在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的党的周围团结得象一个人一样的阿尔巴尼亚人民，已经把自己的祖国变成坚不可摧的社会主义堡垒，胆敢触犯她的任何敌人必将遭到灭亡。
    亲爱的中国代表团的同志们：
    你们的访问即将结束，你们即将返回自己的祖国。我趁此机会请你们向兄弟的中国人民，向中国共产党中央委员会、中华人民共和国政府、中央军委和中央文革，向我国人民最敬爱的朋友毛泽东主席，向他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来同志，转达我国人民、我们党和我国政府的最革命的敬礼以及纯洁友谊和战斗团结的感情。
    最后，我深信，中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜同志率领的中国党政军代表团的访问将进一步加强我们两国人民、我们两党和我们两军之间永恒的战斗友谊。
    请允许我举杯：
    为我国人民同七亿多兄弟的中国人民的伟大的、牢不可破的战斗友谊，
    为英雄的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党，
    为中国人民的伟大领袖、我国人民最敬爱的朋友、伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的健康，
    为无产阶级文化大革命最后的、全面的胜利，
    为毛泽东同志最亲密的战友林彪副主席的健康，
    为中华人民共和国政府和周恩来同志，
    为光荣的中国人民解放军，
    为黄永胜同志和中国党政军代表团全体成员的健康，
    为出席这个招待会的全体来宾的健康，
    为马克思列宁主义的胜利，
    干杯！
