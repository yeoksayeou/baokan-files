Yingtian Town is a newly developed industrial town in Jiangxi Province. The town has more than ten medium and small-sized factories, with industrial workers making up about a quarter of the town's population. There is one middle school and three primary schools in the town. During the proletarian educational revolution, the revolutionary workers of this town adopted the method of "factory-school integration, factories running schools." More than two months of practice have proven that this method is a good way for newly developed industrial towns to achieve proletarian leadership in schools.

The revolutionary workers of Yingtian Town, following Chairman Mao's directive that "the working class must lead everything," formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in late August. With the support of the Leftist Liberation Army, they entered all the schools in the town and took the stage of leading schools to carry out the proletarian educational revolution. After the working class took control of the school's educational power, how could they lead the school to fully implement the brilliant "May 7th Directive" of the great leader Chairman Mao, carry out educational reforms, and achieve the proletarian educational revolution? Based on the specific situation of Yingtian Town, which has many factories, they adopted the method of "factory-school integration, factories running schools," and first had the Yingtian Pump Factory trial-run the Yingtian Middle School, and the Yingtian Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory trial-run the Yingtian Third Primary School. After more than two months of practice, the results were very good. Currently, all other schools in the town have also adopted this method to achieve the proletarian educational revolution.

The practice of "factory-school integration, factories running schools" in Yingtian Town is as follows: The school and the factory are combined, with the school becoming a department of the factory, directly led by the factory. The original school revolutionary committee and all its institutions were abolished, and an education group was established within the factory revolutionary committee to lead the school work, and a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team was sent from the factory to take specific responsibility. The education group of the factory revolutionary committee is headed by a deputy director of the factory revolutionary committee. The school side also selects two to three people to participate in the factory revolutionary committee and the leadership work of the education group. The advantages of "factory-school integration, factories running schools" are:

First, it better implements Chairman Mao's teachings that "the working class must lead everything" and "to achieve the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership from the working class and participation from the working masses." The working class firmly and directly holds all the leadership powers of the school. The working class can lead the school in its own image and cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause. In the past, bourgeois intellectuals dominated the schools, instilling in students the bourgeois ideas of "all trades are inferior, only reading is superior" and "study to become an official." Now, the working class, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," educates students to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's directives, and become good soldiers of Chairman Mao; educates students to study for the revolution, establishing the idea of cultivating themselves into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

Second, implementing "factory-school integration, factories running schools" can better implement the brilliant "May 7th Directive" of the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's series of great teachings on achieving the proletarian educational revolution. In the past, under the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, it was "intellectual education first," tying students to the classroom, making them memorize books, and turning students into "three-separated" bookworms. Now, with factories running schools, students have a fixed place for productive labor. They can participate in productive labor regularly, achieving "learning as the main task, with other skills as supplementary." Many worker and poor peasant student parents have praised that in the past, schools taught students to "think only of mathematics, physics, and chemistry," but now schools teach students to read Chairman Mao's books every day; in the past, students looked down on workers and peasants and on labor, but now students respect workers and peasants as teachers and honor labor. Such a school is good!

Third, implementing "factory-school integration, factories running schools" can more quickly establish a teaching team with workers as the main force. To reform the existing teaching team, more than 70% of the original teachers in the town have been sent to the countryside to settle down and receive re-education from poor peasants. Currently, each school in the town has formed a teaching team with workers as the main force. They have officially taken the podium and established a new type of proletarian teacher-student relationship with the students. The students affectionately call them worker teachers. The students say that in the past, teachers only taught books, not people; only cared about what happened inside the school, not outside. Now, worker teachers care most about our political thoughts, always helping us use Mao Zedong Thought to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, cultivating proletarian thoughts and virtues in us from a young age. Worker teachers are not only teachers in the classroom but also masters during productive labor.

Fourth, implementing "factory-school integration, factories running schools" can better achieve unified leadership and streamline administration. In the past, each school had its own set of staff, but after the schools were led by factories, the number of administrative personnel could be greatly reduced.

After implementing "factory-school integration, factories running schools" in the middle and primary schools of Yingtian Town, the working class firmly grasped the leadership power of the schools. They followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao with a thorough revolutionary spirit, reformed the old teaching system, and achieved many successes in just over two months:

First, reforming the school system. The middle and primary schools in Yingtian Town generally reformed the school system, shortening the study period. Primary schools were changed to a five-year continuous system, and middle schools to a four-year continuous system (two years each for junior and senior high). The Yingtian Third Primary School also added a junior high class, becoming a seven-year continuous system.

Second, reforming the curriculum. Each school boldly simplified the curriculum to make it more practical. Yingtian Middle School reduced the previous dozen courses to five: Mao Zedong Thought, industrial production knowledge, agricultural production knowledge, revolutionary arts (including language knowledge), and military physical education. Currently, each school is compiling teaching materials based on the new curriculum.

Third, reforming teaching methods. Worker teachers smashed the old revisionist teaching methods of "three separations" and insisted on the teaching method of combining teaching with productive labor and theory with practice. In addition to leading students to the factory to participate in labor and attend industrial production knowledge classes every week, they also linked up with the agricultural production teams in the town's suburbs and regularly took students to participate in agricultural labor.

Fourth, learning from the PLA. The original teaching classes were reorganized into platoons, companies, and battalions according to the PLA's organizational structure, and the political work experience of the PLA was learned, emphasizing the four firsts and promoting the spirit of the Three-Eight Style. The primary schools in Yingtian have respectively established the Red Children's Corps and the Little Red Guards. Through learning from the PLA, the organization and discipline of middle and primary school students have been significantly strengthened.

The implementation of "factory-school integration, factories running schools" in the middle and primary schools of Yingtian Town, although it has been a short time, has already shown strong vitality and proven through practice that this method is in line with the direction of socialist development. The middle and primary schools of Yingtian Town are advancing along this direction, determined to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

    工人阶级领导学校的一个好方法
    ——江西鹰潭镇实行“厂校合一，工厂办学”的调查报告
    鹰潭镇是江西省一座新兴的工业城镇。全镇有十几座中、小型工厂，产业工人约占城镇人口的四分之一左右。镇上有一所中学，三所小学。在无产阶级教育革命中，这个镇的革命工人采取了“厂校合一，工厂办学”的方法。两个多月的实践证明，这种方法是新兴工业城镇实现工人阶级领导学校的一个好方法。
    鹰潭镇的革命工人遵照毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的教导，于八月下旬组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在支左解放军配合下，进驻了镇上所有的学校，登上了领导学校实现无产阶级教育革命的政治舞台。工人阶级掌握学校的教育大权后，如何领导学校全面落实伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，进行教学改革，实现无产阶级教育革命？他们根据鹰潭镇工厂较多的具体情况，采取了“厂校合一，工厂办学”的办法，并首先由鹰潭水泵厂试办鹰潭中学，由鹰潭磷肥厂试办鹰潭第三小学。经过两个多月的实践后，证明效果很好。目前全镇其他学校已经全部采取这种方法来实现无产阶级教育革命。
    鹰潭镇实行“厂校合一，工厂办学”的做法是：将学校和工厂合起来，学校成为工厂所属的一个部门，由工厂直接领导。原学校的革命委员会和所属一切机构全部撤销，在工厂革委会内增设教育组领导学校工作，并由工厂派出毛泽东思想宣传队到学校具体负责。工厂革委会的教育组由厂革委会一名副主任任组长。学校方面也推选二至三人参加工厂革委会，参与教育组的领导工作。这种“厂校合一，工厂办学”的好处是：
    一，更好地落实了毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”和“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的伟大教导，学校的一切领导大权，都直接地、牢固地掌握在工人阶级手里。工人阶级可以按照自己的面貌领导学校，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。过去资产阶级知识分子统治学校，向学生灌输“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”
  “读书做官论”等封、资、修的黑货。现在，工人阶级遵照伟大领袖毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导，教育学生读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士；教育学生为革命读书，确立起把自己培养成有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者的思想。
    二，实行“厂校合一，工厂办学”，能更好地落实伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示和毛主席关于实现无产阶级教育革命的一系列伟大教导。过去在反革命修正主义教育路线统治下，是“智育挂帅”，把学生束缚在课堂里，死啃书本，学生成了“三脱离”的书呆子。现在工厂办学，学生有了固定的生产劳动场所。可以定期参加生产劳动，做到“以学为主，兼学别样”。许多工人和贫下中农的学生家长都赞扬说，过去学校教学生“一心想着数理化”，现在学校教学生每天必读毛主席的书；过去学生轻视工农、轻视劳动，现在学生拜工农为师，以劳动为荣。这样的学校就是好！
    三，实行“厂校合一，工厂办学”，能更迅速地建立起一支以工人为主体的教师队伍。为了对原有的教师队伍进行改造，现在全镇原有教师的百分之七十以上已下放到农村安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育。全镇各学校目前已经组成一支以工人为主体的教师队伍，他们正式登上讲台，和学生建立起了无产阶级新型的师生关系。学生们亲切地称他们为工人老师。学生们说，过去老师只教书，不教人；只管校内，不管校外。现在的工人老师最关心我们的政治思想，时时、事事帮助我们用毛泽东思想斗私批修，让我们从小就培养起无产阶级的思想品德。工人教师既是学生课堂上的老师，又是参加生产劳动时的师傅。
    四，实行“厂校合一，工厂办学”，能更好地实现一元化的领导和精兵简政。过去各学校都有一套编制，学校由工厂领导后，就可以大大减少管理人员。
    鹰潭镇的中、小学实行“厂校合一，工厂办学”后，工人阶级牢牢地掌握了学校的领导权，他们按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以彻底革命的精神，改革旧的教学制度，在短短两个多月中已经做出了不少成绩：
    一，改革学制。鹰潭镇的中、小学普遍对学制进行了改革，缩短学习年限，小学改成五年一贯制，中学改成四年一贯制（初、高中各两年）。鹰潭第三小学还增设了初中班，变成七年一贯制。
    二，改革课程。各校都对课程大胆地删繁就简，力求实用。鹰潭中学将过去的十几门课程改成五门：即毛泽东思想课，工业生产知识课，农业生产知识课，革命文艺（包括语文知识）课，军体课。现在，各校都在根据新的课程设置编写教材。
    三，改革教学方法。工人教师砸烂了过去修正主义那套“三脱离”的教学方法，坚持教学与生产劳动相结合，理论与实践相结合的教学方法。他们除了每周带领学生到工厂去参加劳动和上工业生产知识课以外，还同镇郊农业生产队挂钩，定时带学生去参加农业劳动。
    四，大学解放军。把原来的教学班改为按解放军连队建制编成班、排、连，同时学习解放军的政治工作经验，突出四个第一，大兴三八作风。鹰潭的小学都分别成立了红色儿童团和红小兵等组织。通过大学解放军，中、小学生的组织性纪律性都有显著加强。
    鹰潭镇的中、小学实行“厂校合一，工厂办学”虽然时间很短，但已经显示出了强大的生命力，并以它的实践证明，这个办法是符合社会主义发展的方向的。鹰潭镇的中、小学校正沿着这个方向乘胜前进，决心将无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
