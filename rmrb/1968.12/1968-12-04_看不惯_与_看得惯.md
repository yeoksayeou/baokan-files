    "Can't Stand It" and "Can Stand It"
    Member of the Shanghai Foreign Language Institute Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, Zhao Guo Hua

    *Editor's Note from Red Flag Magazine*: This article is written by a member of the Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. He has conducted a specific analysis of the concrete problems he encountered. We welcome members of the propaganda teams to write such analytical articles for our magazine.

    Many of our comrades in the Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team felt "can't stand it" as soon as they stepped into the Shanghai Foreign Language Institute. What can't they stand? They can't stand the bourgeois intellectuals' focus on food and drink, their meticulous attention to clothing; in academic style, they can't stand the empty talk, detachment from reality, and the use of Marxism-Leninism for others but liberalism for themselves; in organizational discipline, they can't stand the laxity and freedom. Especially our old workers, when they see this situation, they always shake their heads and say: "Can't stand it."

    This is one kind of "can't stand it."

    Some intellectuals say: "The worker propaganda teams emphasize class stance, which is good, but sometimes they are too pedantic about small things." Or they say: "The worker propaganda teams strictly enforce discipline and style, which is good, but in some specific situations, they are not flexible enough." They speak very tactfully, but in their hearts, it is the same three words: "can't stand it." This is another kind of "can't stand it."

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are inevitably stamped with the mark of class." Whether one "can't stand it" or "can stand it" about a certain social phenomenon, ultimately reflects one's social and economic position, and is determined by one's class stance. We workers can't stand the style of bourgeois intellectuals and the revisionist educational system, which shows our firm proletarian stance. The proletariat is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. How can we stand those bourgeois styles and revisionist educational systems that serve the bourgeois reactionary line? The proletariat is the most organized, has the most revolutionary discipline, and has the highest communist ideals. Laxity, inconsistency in words and deeds, and getting angry when "independent kingdoms" are touched—these are the evil fruits of long-term rule by the revisionist educational line and poisoning by bourgeois ideology. How can we, the proletariat, stand it? This shows that what the proletariat can stand, the bourgeoisie can't stand; what the bourgeoisie can stand, the proletariat necessarily can't stand. "Can't stand it" is a phenomenon, but behind this phenomenon, we see the fierce struggle between two classes and two worldviews.

    What to do about "can't stand it"? There are three attitudes towards this issue: One is to close your eyes and not look when you can't stand it, not criticizing or fighting; the second is to scold when you can't stand it, to "vent some anger"; the third is to "look" even when you can't stand it—this is to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and criticize, and to resolutely fight against those bourgeois ugly things that you can't stand, and to thoroughly transform them.

    The first attitude is passive liberalism. Those who hold this attitude not only cannot transform what they can't stand, but may also be transformed by what they can't stand, becoming captives of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview." If you avoid something just because you can't stand it, and do not fight against it, you will eventually surrender to the bourgeoisie. There is a living example of this: A student from a poor peasant family, when he first entered the institute, also "couldn't stand" the bourgeois intellectuals' ways, but he did not realize that there was fierce class struggle in this "can't stand it," so he let down his guard and disarmed himself ideologically. Over time, from "can't stand it" to "can stand it," and from "can stand it" to envy, he thought that others wearing "Dacron" were elegant, while he wore homespun clothes, which were rustic, so he secretly put the homespun clothes at the bottom of the box and started to imitate the style he used to "can't stand." This living example does not ring the alarm for those comrades who only passively "can't stand it"?

    The second attitude is good intentions but bad results. These comrades only start from the phenomenon of "can't stand it" and do not analyze the essence, so they will not have the correct methods to solve the problem. Chairman Mao teaches us to analyze all things with a realistic attitude. "'Reality' is all objectively existing things, 'is' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, the law, 'seek' is our research." Among intellectuals, there are various situations, a few are enemy contradictions, the vast majority are contradictions among the people. Most or the majority of intellectuals are willing to progress, willing to be transformed, and can be transformed, this is an objective fact; some intellectuals have bourgeois ideological styles that we, the workers, can't stand, this is the result of the influence and poisoning of the revisionist educational line. Therefore, we must seriously investigate and analyze the broad masses of intellectuals, do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, and carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism and struggle, so as to unite the majority and strike at a small handful. For the extremely few bad elements, we must also conduct in-depth investigations and research, grasp sufficient materials, and accurately strike them with force. Vague "scolding" cannot hit the revolutionary elements, but may give the enemy an opportunity. Therefore, the simple method of "scolding" because of "can't stand it" cannot educate people, nor can it expose the enemy. Even if you scolded, this "can't stand it" phenomenon is suppressed, but it is only temporary and cannot solve the fundamental problem.

    Many of our worker teachers have firmly taken the third attitude, which is: fully recognize the role of the proletariat as the main force in transforming the old world, the proletariat has taken the stage of political struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure, and must insist on transforming these places with the appearance of the proletariat. In specific work, we must grasp Chairman Mao's policies and distinguish between two types of contradictions. We came to the school to overthrow the things we "can't stand," to thoroughly and universally reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, and finally end the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the school, according to the worldview of the proletariat, that is, Mao Zedong Thought, to change the face of the school, and finally from "can't stand it" to "can stand it," that is, to truly become our own school of the proletariat, to become a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

### “看不惯”与“看得惯”

    “看不惯”与“看得惯”
    驻上海外国语学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员　赵国华
    《红旗》杂志编者按：这篇是一位工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员同志的文章。他对遇到的具体问题进行了具体分析。我们欢迎宣传队员同志们给本刊写这样的有分析的文章。
    我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队里的许多同志，一跨进上海外国语学院大门，第一个感觉就是“看不惯”。什么看不惯？资产阶级知识分子在生活上谈吃谈喝、讲究衣着看不惯；在学风上，夸夸其谈，脱离实际，对人马列主义、对己自由主义看不惯；在组织纪律上，松松垮垮，逍遥自在看不惯。特别是我们的老工人看到这种情况，总是摇摇头说：“看不惯。”
    这是一种“看不惯”。
    某些知识分子说：“工宣队强调阶级立场，好是好，就是有时一些小事也过分顶真。”或者说：“工宣队狠抓作风、纪律，好是好，就是在某些具体情况下不够灵活。”嘴上说得十分婉转，肚子里也是三个字：看不惯。这是又一种看不惯。
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”对某一种社会现象“看不惯”与“看得惯”，归根结蒂是一个人的社会的经济地位的反映，是由他的阶级立场所决定的。我们工人对资产阶级知识分子的作风看不惯，对修正主义教育制度看不惯，就表现了我们坚定的无产阶级立场。工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，怎么能看得惯那些为资产阶级反动路线服务的资产阶级作风和修正主义教育制度呢？工人阶级最有组织，最有革命纪律，最有崇高的共产主义理想。松松垮垮，言行不一，一触犯到“独立王国”的利益就火冒三丈，这些长期受修正主义教育路线统治和资产阶级思想毒害的恶果，我们工人阶级怎么能看得惯呢？这就说明，无产阶级看得惯的东西，资产阶级就看不惯；资产阶级看得惯的东西，无产阶级也就必然会看不惯。“看不惯”，这是一种现象，透过现象，我们在“看不惯”的背后看到了两个阶级、两种世界观的激烈斗争。
    看不惯怎么办？对待这个问题有三种态度：一种是看不惯就闭眼不看，不批评、不斗争；第二种是看不惯就训一顿，“出出气”；第三种是看不惯偏要“看”——就是要用毛泽东思想去分析批判，下决心同那些“看不惯”的资产阶级丑东西作不疲倦的斗争，并彻底改造之。
    前一种是消极的自由主义态度。抱着这种态度的人，不仅不能改造“看不惯”的东西，而且有可能被“看不惯”的东西所改造，成为资产阶级的俘虏。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”假若你由于看不惯就不去碰它，不去斗争，到后来就会向资产阶级投降。有这么一个活生生的例子：有个学生出身于贫农家庭，刚进学院时，对资产阶级知识分子的一套也“看不惯”，但他并没有觉察到在这种“看不惯”里存在着激烈的阶级斗争，因而失去了警惕，解除了思想武装，时间一长，从“看不惯”到“看得惯”，又从“看得惯”到羡慕，觉得人家穿“的确凉”漂亮，自己穿的是土布衣服，土里土气，就偷偷地把土布衣服塞进了箱底，也学起他原来“看不惯”的那种派头来了。这个活生生的事例，不就向那些只是消极的“看不惯”的同志敲起了警钟了吗？
    第二种态度是好心办不成好事。这些同志只从“看不惯”的现象出发，不作本质的分析，因此就不会有正确的方法去求得问题的解决。毛主席教导我们要用实事求是的态度去分析一切事物。“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。”知识分子中有各种不同情况，少数是敌我矛盾，绝大多数是人民内部矛盾。多数或大多数知识分子是愿意进步、愿意改造、也是可以改造的，这是客观存在的事实；某些知识分子所以存在我们工人阶级看不惯的资产阶级思想作风，这是修正主义教育路线对他们影响、毒害的结果。因此，我们要对广大知识分子认真地作调查分析，做深入细致的思想政治工作，深入开展革命的大批判，这样才能团结大多数，打击一小撮。对于极少数坏人，也要靠进行深入的调查研究，掌握充分的材料，准确地给以有力的打击，笼统地“训”并不能击中反革命分子，反而可能给敌人以可乘之机。因此，那种因“看不惯”就“训一顿”的简单做法是教育不了人的，也不能暴露敌人，即使训了一下，这种“看不惯”的现象压下去了，那也是暂时的，是不能解决根本问题的。
    我们很多工人老师傅都坚定地采取了第三种态度，这就是：充分认识工人阶级改造旧世界的主力军的作用，工人阶级登上上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台，就是要坚持用工人阶级面貌去改造这些地方。在具体工作中，要掌握毛主席的政策，区别两类不同性质的矛盾。我们开到学校里来，就是要革我们“看不惯”的东西的命，对一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，实行彻底的、普遍的改革，最终结束资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治，按照工人阶级的世界观，即毛泽东思想去改变学校面貌，最后从“看不惯”变成“看得惯”，即变成真正是我们工人阶级自己的学校，变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
