On the eve of winning national victory, the great teacher Chairman Mao instructed us at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns; they are truly heroes in front of these enemies. However, they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will lose the battle in front of sugar bullets." The facts of the past nineteen years have fully proven that Chairman Mao's foresight is extremely wise and correct. Some people cannot withstand the attack of "sugar bullets," have been captured by bourgeois ideology, and have become the objects of continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a lesson that people should always remember.

In a peaceful environment and in the face of victory, how can we resist the attack of "sugar bullets"? We believe that raising the awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and always struggling hard is the best anti-corruption agent against bourgeois and revisionist ideologies. By always carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle, one can resist corruption, stay young, and remain revolutionary. In our company's honor room, there is a pair of patched socks with twenty-eight patches and a sole as thick as a few coins. This pair of socks was worn by the old platoon leader Wang Zhangyi for five whole years. One day, Wang Zhangyi was squatting by a small ditch washing clothes. A new soldier saw his socks and jokingly said, "Platoon leader, your socks are almost like shoes. Let them go to the 'museum'!" Hearing this, Wang Zhangyi felt as if his heart was being pricked by needles. That night, he called a few new soldiers to study Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and had a heart-to-heart talk with them. Pointing to his pair of clean socks, he said solemnly: It accompanied me over the snowy mountains and deserts, not only helping me endure the cold but also helping me resist toxins. In the past, when I saw old comrades wearing such "thousand-layered" socks, I was also puzzled. Buying a pair of stockings doesn't cost much money. Why bother to "suffer" like this? Later, with the help of old comrades, I realized that hard struggle is the essence of the proletariat and the need for the proletariat to fight against the bourgeoisie. To follow Chairman Mao and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, we must always maintain the spirit of hard struggle and be vigilant not to lose the battle in front of "sugar bullets" and become captives of the bourgeoisie.

Comrade Wang Zhangyi is such a person who consciously maintains and carries forward the spirit of hard struggle. The harsh life on the high plateau has made his anti-corruption ability stronger and stronger, making him a model of hard struggle in the company and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. When he was transferred to become a deputy instructor, his comrades asked him to leave the socks to the company.

Last November, our company moved from the mountains to the city to carry out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks. In the face of new tasks, new environments, and new situations, new problems also arose. One day, a soldier threw a pair of patched socks into the trash can. It turned out that he thought wearing such socks was not in line with the city's taste. The party branch helped him study Chairman Mao's teaching: "Because of victory, arrogance within the party, the mentality of considering oneself a hero, the mentality of stopping progress, the mentality of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." This made him realize that a pair of socks is a small matter, but it reflects a big problem, indicating that he lost a battle in the face of the bourgeoisie's attack. The next day, at the company's sharing meeting, this soldier, with tears in his eyes, held the pair of patched socks he had picked up, and recounted his bitter family history. He said painfully: "I have forgotten my roots! What I threw away is not a pair of old socks, but the glorious tradition of hard struggle of our party and army, the essence of the working people, and the excellent qualities of revolutionary soldiers."

The story of the two pairs of socks makes us clearly see that maintaining and carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle is not only a need for fighting against nature but more importantly a need for anti-revisionism and anti-corruption. Loving hardship is loving revolution; abandoning hardship is abandoning revolution. Consciously maintaining and carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle, the proletarian ideological position can be firmly guarded; if the spirit of hard struggle is relaxed, bourgeois ideology will take advantage of the opportunity. The two pairs of socks, one kept and one thrown away, show the difference in the spirit of hard struggle and the difference in anti-corruption ability. The spiritual state shown in the keeping and throwing away reflects the class struggle in the ideological realm.

    艰苦奋斗的作风永不丢
    工程兵某部十连党支部
    在夺取全国胜利的前夕，伟大导师毛主席在党的七届二中全会上告诫我们说：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”十九年来的事实，完全证明了毛主席的预见十分英明，十分正确。有些人就是经不起“糖弹”的攻击，被资产阶级思想俘虏了，成了无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的对象。这是值得人们永远记取的教训。
    在和平环境里，在胜利面前，怎样才能抗住“糖弹”的攻击呢？我们认为，提高执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，永远艰苦奋斗，是对资产阶级思想、修正主义思想最好的防腐剂。永远发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，就可以使人抗拒腐蚀，永葆青春，永远革命。我们连的荣誉室里，有一双补了二十八个补钉、底有几个铜钱厚的破布袜子。这双袜子，老排长王章义整整穿了五年。一天，王章义蹲在小河沟洗衣服，一个新战士看到他这双袜子，开玩笑地说：“排长啊，你这双袜子快成鞋子啦，让它进‘博物馆’去吧！”听了这话，王章义心里象针扎一样不好受。晚上，他把排里几个新战士找来，一起学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，一起谈心。他指着脚上这双洗得干干净净的袜子，语重心长地说：它跟我一起翻雪山，越戈壁，不仅帮我御严寒，还帮我抗毒素。过去我看到老同志穿着这种“千层底”的袜子，也纳闷过，买双线袜，花不了几个钱，何必这样“自找苦吃”呢？后来，在老同志帮助下，我才认识到，艰苦奋斗是无产阶级的本色，是无产阶级对资产阶级进行斗争的需要。要紧跟毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就要永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风，时刻警惕不要在“糖弹”面前打败仗，成为资产阶级的俘虏。
    王章义同志就是这样自觉地保持和发扬了艰苦奋斗的作风。风雪高原的艰苦生活，使他的防腐能力越来越强，成为连里艰苦奋斗的标兵，学习毛主席著作积极分子。当他调离连队去当副指导员时，同志们要求他把这双袜子留给了连队。
    去年十一月，我连由山沟进入城市执行“三支”“两军”任务。在新任务、新环境、新形势面前，也出现了新的问题。有一天，一个战士把一双补了又补的布袜子扔到垃圾箱里去了。原来，他觉得穿这样的袜子，不合城市的味道。党支部帮助他带着问题，学习了毛主席“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长”的教导，使他认识到，一双袜子是小事，但却反映了大问题，说明自己在资产阶级思想的进攻面前，打了一次败仗。第二天，在连里召开的讲用会上，这个战士含着泪水，捧着拣回来的那双破布袜子，诉说了自己苦难的家史。他沉痛地说：“我忘本了！我扔掉的不是一双破袜子，而是我党我军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，劳动人民的本色，革命战士的优秀品质。”
    两双袜子的故事，使我们清楚地看到，保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，不仅仅是战天斗地的需要，更重要的是反修防修的需要。爱艰苦，就是爱革命；丢掉艰苦，就会丢掉革命。自觉保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，无产阶级思想阵地就守得牢牢的；艰苦奋斗作风松一松，资产阶级思想就乘虚而入。两双袜子，一留一扔，就是艰苦奋斗作风的差距，就是防腐能力的差距。这一留一扔之间所表现出的精神状态，就是思想领域的阶级斗争。
