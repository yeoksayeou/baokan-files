Cooperative Medicine is Good
— An Investigation Report on the Implementation of Cooperative Medicine in Yangwu Brigade

Yangwu Brigade in Dalingshan Commune, Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, has 576 households and 2,563 people. The brigade started implementing cooperative medicine in 1960. Located in a mountainous area far from urban centers, the brigade had no doctors before collectivization. When someone fell ill, they had to travel more than ten miles to see a doctor. Later, relying on the power of organization, they established a cooperative medical system, trained their own "barefoot doctors," and set up their own medical stations, changing the backward situation where there were no doctors or medicine.

How Cooperative Medicine Came into Being

As early as 1957, during the high-level cooperative period, Yangwu Brigade established a health room and appointed a health worker to treat minor injuries and illnesses for the masses. They also began training "barefoot doctors" from among the poor and lower-middle peasants. After the establishment of the commune in 1958, the brigade, as part of Dalingshan Commune, implemented a lump-sum medical system where commune members did not pay for medical treatment, and the commune covered the costs from collective economic funds. Later, they summarized the experience of the lump-sum medical system and realized that it was difficult for the commune to fully cover the medical expenses of the poor and lower-middle peasants when the collective economy was still weak. Therefore, they decided to organize cooperative medicine to replace the lump-sum medical system.

Both cooperative medicine and the commune's lump-sum medical system provide collective assistance to commune members for medical treatment; the difference lies in the degree of assistance: the lump-sum medical system covers all costs, with commune members paying nothing; cooperative medicine requires each person to contribute 1.5 fen per month as capital, with out-patient registration fees paid by the individual, 70% of out-patient medication costs covered by cooperative medicine, and all in-patient medication costs covered by cooperative medicine. This approach promotes class solidarity among the poor and lower-middle peasants and prevents the waste of medicine, saving expenses. In 1967, the brigade's cooperative medical funds had several hundred yuan in surplus.

Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line Guides the Consolidation and Development of Cooperative Medicine

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns." Cooperative medicine is a revolutionary innovation by the masses. It has been consolidated and developed through the fierce struggle between the two lines, and its implementation is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In 1960, when Yangwu Brigade first started cooperative medicine, they encountered obstruction from the medical and health departments. They refused to supply medicine to the medical station run by the brigade's "barefoot doctors," attempting to strangle the nascent cooperative medicine in its cradle. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangwu Brigade, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, insisted on continuing. When they couldn't get medicine, they bought it themselves from retail pharmacies. The commune health department then issued an order stating that the "barefoot doctors" of Yangwu Brigade's medical station were "not graduates of medical school" and had no "certificates," so they were not allowed to practice medicine. This order was also resisted by the poor and lower-middle peasants, who said: "We want the 'barefoot doctors' to treat us; we don't need your 'certificates'!"

The commune health department could not suppress Yangwu Brigade's cooperative medicine, so a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee sent a "work team" in 1961 to spread the fallacies that "cooperative medicine is a burden on everyone when one person gets sick, it is a new communist wind," and "it violates the policy of less deduction and more distribution," inciting a few upper-middle peasants to withdraw from cooperative medicine. The cadres of Yangwu Brigade, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, trusted and relied on the masses, and engaged in a head-on struggle with this "work team." When the "work team" tried to dissolve cooperative medicine, the cadres organized a re-registration. The poor and lower-middle peasants felt that cooperative medicine was good, and as a result, every household registered, and everyone participated. This "work team," which came to promote Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line, had to slink away in defeat.

Since the Cultural Revolution, Yangwu Brigade's cooperative medicine has been further consolidated and developed. Currently, its experience is being promoted throughout the county.

Cooperative Medicine Has Great Advantages

The practice of cooperative medicine in Yangwu Brigade over more than eight years has proven that it has great advantages:

1. Preventing the poor and lower-middle peasants from falling into economic difficulties due to illness. Poor peasant He Jinhou contracted tuberculosis in 1957, sold his house but still could not afford medical treatment, and incurred a debt of 80 yuan. Incomplete statistics show that at that time, there were 30 households in the entire brigade who fell into difficulties due to illness, with 12 households selling their houses and furniture to pay for medical treatment. Since the implementation of cooperative medicine, this situation has disappeared.

2. The health of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants is guaranteed, minor illnesses can be treated early, and major illnesses have medical support. Since the establishment of cooperative medicine in 1960, over more than eight years, 156 people in the entire brigade have been sent to the commune, county, and provincial hospitals for treatment, with some individuals' medical expenses exceeding 1,000 yuan. However, the number of commune members who died from illness has significantly decreased. Poor peasant Liu Jiakun had an intestinal ulcer, which was ineffective in local treatment. He was immediately transferred to the county hospital for surgery, costing more than 1,000 yuan to be cured. She was very moved and often educated her children, saying: "Great Leader Chairman Mao saved me. You must always remember Chairman Mao's kindness and always be loyal to Chairman Mao." Seventy-eight-year-old old poor peasant He Jujin lost his sight in 1950 and regained it in 1967 after treatment. He said with tears in his eyes: "This is the second light that Chairman Mao has given me."

3. Promoting collective production and consolidating and developing the collective economy. Yangwu Brigade has many people but few laborers. Before the establishment of cooperative medicine, a portion of the labor force was unable to work due to illness. During the spring and summer harvests, they had to borrow labor from other brigades. After the establishment of cooperative medicine, a portion of the labor force was freed from illness, not only no longer needing support from others but also becoming the brigade with the fastest transplanting in the entire commune.

From Yangwu Brigade, We See the Direction of Rural Medical and Health Work

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The focus of medical and health work should be shifted to the countryside." The experience of Yangwu Brigade shows that to fundamentally change the past phenomenon where medical and health work only serves a few people, we must:

1. Be self-reliant and train doctors from among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Yangwu Brigade, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, takes the road of self-reliance, training four doctors: three Western medicine doctors and one traditional Chinese medicine doctor. These four doctors, except for one traditional Chinese medicine doctor who practiced before liberation, were all selected and trained from among the poor and lower-middle peasants after the establishment of cooperatives. They generally have only primary school education, were sent by the brigade to study with doctors in the county for a period, and then returned to the brigade's medical station to improve through practice. These doctors can now not only treat common illnesses but also cure some serious diseases. Training their own doctors breaks the long-term monopoly of medical technology by bourgeois intellectuals, enabling medical and health work to better serve the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

2. The remuneration for rural doctors is based on work points instead of a wage system, which can reduce the burden on the masses and the collective and narrow the gap between mental and physical labor. The four doctors, one veterinarian, and two pharmacists in Yangwu Brigade all use the work points system and directly participate in the collective distribution of the production team. For example, in 1967, the seven people averaged 259 yuan per person, roughly equal to the distribution of general labor.

3. Medicines can be sourced locally, fully utilizing China's vast territory, rich resources, and advantageous conditions. Yangwu Brigade's medical station has a traditional Chinese medicine doctor who can treat illnesses and recognize medicinal herbs. The medicines he prescribes are all sourced locally, which is convenient for the masses and solves the problem of temporary shortages of medicines, reducing the burden on the masses and the collective.

4. Organizing cooperative medicine, training their own "barefoot doctors," treating illnesses, collecting, and selling medicines form a medical system that fundamentally solves the economic burden of farmers seeking medical treatment and changes the situation in rural areas where there are "no doctors and no medicines."

    合作医疗就是好
    ——杨屋大队实行合作医疗的调查报告
    广东省东莞县大岭山公社杨屋大队共有五百七十六户，二千五百六十三人。这个大队从一九六○年开始实行合作医疗。这里地处山区，远离城镇。公社化以前，队里没有医生，有病要跑十多里路找医生诊治。后来，他们发扬革命的首创精神，依靠组织起来的力量，办起了合作医疗，培养自己的“赤脚医生”，建立起自己的医疗站，改变了过去一无医、二无药的落后面貌。
      合作医疗是怎样产生的
    杨屋大队早在一九五七年高级社时期就建起了保健室，设立了保健员，为群众治疗一些轻伤病症，并开始培养贫下中农自己的“赤脚医生”。一九五八年公社化后，大队所在的大岭山公社统一实行包干医疗，社员看病不花钱，由公社从集体经济中开支。后来，他们总结了包干医疗的经验，认识到在集体经济还薄弱的情况下，由公社把贫下中农的医疗费用全部包下来还有困难，就决定组织合作医疗来代替包干医疗。
    合作医疗与公社包干医疗，相同的地方是社员治病都得到集体的帮助；不同的是，帮助的程度有差别：包干医疗是全包，社员一分钱也不花；合作医疗则由每人每月交一角五分钱作股金，看病挂号费自付，门诊药费从合作医疗中开支七成，住院的药费全部由合作医疗负担。这样做，发扬了贫下中农社员之间的阶级友爱精神，又可以防止浪费药物，节约开支。一九六七年大队的合作医疗费，就有几百元节余。
      毛主席的革命路线指引合作
  医疗不断巩固和发展
    毛主席教导我们：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”合作医疗是群众的革命创举，它是在两条路线的激烈斗争中巩固和发展起来的，它的实行，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    一九六○年，杨屋大队一开始举办合作医疗，就遇到医药卫生部门的阻挠。他们不配药给由大队“赤脚医生”办起来的医疗站，妄图把新生的合作医疗扼杀在摇篮之中。但是，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的杨屋大队的贫下中农，坚决要办下去，配不到药，就自己到零售药店去买。公社卫生部门的老爷接着又下了一道命令，说什么杨屋大队医疗站的“赤脚医生”“未经医科学校毕业”，没有“牌牌”，不准他们看病。这道命令也被贫下中农顶住了，他们说：我们愿意让“赤脚医生”看病；不要你们的“牌牌”！
    公社卫生部门压不垮杨屋大队的合作医疗，旧县委内一小撮走资派就在一九六一年派来了一个“工作队”，到处散播什么“合作医疗是一人患病百人负担，是新共产风”，“违反少扣多分的分配政策”等等谬论，煽动几户上中农退出合作医疗。杨屋大队的干部，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，同这个“工作队”进行了针锋相对的斗争。“工作队”要解散合作医疗，干部们就来一次重新报名参加。贫下中农感到合作医疗就是好，结果户户报名，人人参加。这个前来推销刘少奇反革命修正主义卫生路线的“工作队”只好灰溜溜地跑掉了。
    文化大革命以来，杨屋大队的合作医疗得到了进一步的巩固和发展。目前，它的经验正在全县推广。
      合作医疗有巨大的优越性
    杨屋大队实行合作医疗八年多的实践证明，合作医疗具有巨大的优越性：
    一、防止因病造成贫下中农经济困难。贫农何进后，在一九五七年患肺结核，卖了房屋还不够医病用，又负债八十元。据不完全统计，那时全大队因病造成的困难户有三十户，其中变卖房子、家具治病的有十二户。自从实行合作医疗以来，这种情况就没有了。
    二、广大贫下中农的健康有了保障，小病能得到早治，大病医疗也有了依靠。从一九六○年举办合作医疗以来的八年多时间，全大队因病送到公社、县、省里医治的就有一百五十六人，个别人的医疗费高达千元以上，但因病死亡的社员大大减少。贫农刘加款肠内生疮，在当地医治无效，立即转送县医院开刀，花了一千多元才治好。她非常感动，经常教育自己的孩子说：“伟大领袖毛主席把我救活了。你们要永远牢记毛主席的恩情，要永远忠于毛主席。”七十八岁的老贫农何就锦，一九五○年双目失明，一九六七年经医治复明，他热泪盈眶地说：“这是毛主席给了我第二次光明。”
    三、促进集体生产，巩固和发展了集体经济。杨屋大队田多人少。办合作医疗以前，有一部分劳动力患病不能出勤。每年春、夏两造农田大忙时，都要从别的大队抽调劳力前来支援。办了合作医疗后，一部分劳动力从疾病中解放出来，不但不再需要人家支援，而且成为全公社插秧最快的一个大队。
      从杨屋大队看农村医疗卫生
  工作的方向
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”。杨屋大队的经验说明，要从根本上改变过去医疗卫生工作只为少数人服务的现象，必须做到：
    一、自力更生，培养贫下中农自己的医生。杨屋大队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走自力更生的道路，自己培养了四个医生：三名西医，一名中医。这四个医生，除一个中医在解放前当过医生外，其余三人都是合作化以后从贫下中农中选拔培养起来的。他们一般只有小学文化程度，由大队派到县里跟医生学习一个时期后，就回到大队的医疗站里，在实践中提高。这些医生现在不仅能医治常见的一般的疾病，而且还能治好一些重病。培养自己的医生，就打破了医疗技术长期被资产阶级知识分子垄断的局面，使医疗卫生工作能更好地为广大贫下中农服务。
    二、农村医生报酬用工分制代替了工资制，可以减轻群众和集体的负担，可以缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。杨屋大队的四个医生、一个兽医和两个配药人员，都用记工分的办法，直接参加生产队的集体分配。以一九六七年为例，七个人平均每人分配二百五十九元，与一般劳动力分配大体相等。
    三、药物可以就地取材，充分发挥我国地大物博、资源丰富的有利条件。杨屋大队医疗站有一个中医，能看病，又识山药材。他所医的病，用药都是就地取材，既方便群众，又解决了药物一时不足的困难，减轻了群众和集体的负担。
    四、把组织合作医疗，自己培养“赤脚医生”，治病、采集和配售药物三者结合起来，组成一个医疗体系，从根本上解决农民治病的经济负担问题，改变了农村“一无医、二无药”的状况。
