The report and important editorial note published in the People's Daily about the cooperative medical system implemented in Leyuan Commune, Changyang County, Hubei Province, truly touches the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants! We wholeheartedly endorse it and support it from the bottom of our hearts!

The cooperative medical system is excellent! It is a good measure to implement the brilliant directive of our great leader Chairman Mao to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." It completely conforms to Chairman Mao's proletarian health line. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and care for us poor and lower-middle peasants! After reading this report, we are extremely moved and shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao! We wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

In the old society, poverty and illness were like two shackles around our necks. At that time, we poor people feared illness the most. When we fell ill, we had no money to seek treatment and had to endure the pain with our eyes wide open. After liberation, Chairman Mao saved us from the pit of fire, led us to form mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and establish people's communes, and set us on the bright path of socialism. Our lives as poor and lower-middle peasants have improved like sesame seeds blooming, with each stage better than the last, turning poor days into good days. The shackle of poverty has been smashed. However, due to the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-chih's fierce opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian health line and his relentless promotion of the revisionist health line, he established a "gentleman's" health department in the cities, resulting in a long-term situation of no doctors and no medicine in the countryside, making it impossible for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to receive medical treatment when they fall ill. Even in places where there are doctors and medicine, they are not there to treat us poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses have exposed the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-chih, and his revisionist health line has been criticized. We poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed! Now, with the implementation of the cooperative medical system, the problem of poor and lower-middle peasants not being able to see a doctor or afford medicine is finally solved. The shackle of illness is about to be smashed!

The benefits of the cooperative medical system are indeed numerous and cannot be fully described.

When we discussed the cooperative medical system implemented in Leyuan Commune, we also came up with a few suggestions:

1. Strengthen political and ideological work, and let the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants uphold the spirit of communism and collectivism.

2. Issue a "medical record book" to each member participating in the cooperative medical system, and record each visit to the doctor to promote the conservation of medical funds.

3. Fully utilize effective traditional remedies and acupuncture, and use a combination of traditional and modern methods to reduce medical expenses as much as possible.

4. Medical personnel from urban hospitals should also frequently go to the countryside, study the treatment methods for common and frequently occurring diseases, and prevent the erroneous tendency of not wanting to go to the countryside just because the countryside has implemented the cooperative medical system.

    真说到咱贫下中农心坎里了
    《人民日报》发表的湖北省长阳县乐园公社实行合作医疗制度的报道和重要编者按，真说到咱贫下中农心坎里了！我们举双手赞成，打心眼里拥护！
    合作医疗制度太好了！这是落实伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的光辉指示的好措施，完全符合毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线。这是毛主席他老人家对咱贫下中农的最大关心，最大爱护！看了这篇报道，我们心情万分激动，千遍万遍高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    在旧社会，一贫、二病，就象两把枷锁，套在我们贫下中农的脖子上。那时，咱穷人最怕的是得病，有病没钱治，睁着两眼受病痛。解放后，毛主席把我们救出了火坑，领导我们组织互助组、合作社，成立人民公社，走上了社会主义的光明大道。咱贫下中农的生活，好象芝麻开花，一节比一节高，穷日子变成了富日子。“贫”这把枷锁给砸碎了。可是，由于大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇极力对抗毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线，拚命推行修正主义的卫生路线，大搞城市“老爷”卫生部，造成农村中长期一无医、二无药的状况，使广大贫下中农有病得不到医疗。有的地方就是有医有药，也不是为咱贫下中农看病的。
    在毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众把大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇揪了出来，他那条修正主义的卫生路线也遭到了批判，咱贫下中农心里有说不出的痛快！现在，再实行合作医疗制度，那可就解决了贫下中农看不起病、吃不起药的大问题。“病”这把枷锁也快要砸烂了！
    要说合作医疗制度的好处，实在是太多了，说也说不完。
    我们在讨论乐园公社实行的合作医疗制度的时候，也想了几点建议：
    一、加强政治思想工作，广大贫下中农要发扬共产主义风格和集体主义精神。
    二、参加合作医疗的社员，每人发一本“医疗手册”，每次看病都登记，促使大家注意节约医疗基金。
    三、充分挖掘有效的土方、偏方，发挥针灸的作用，使用“土洋结合”的办法，尽量减少医药费用。
    四、城市医院的医务人员也要常下农村，多研究常见病、多发病的治疗方法，要防止以农村实行了合作医疗制度为借口，不愿下农村的错误倾向。
