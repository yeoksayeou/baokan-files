	The revolutionary workers of the Yangtze River Shipping Company, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, are earnestly implementing the great tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. While doing a good job in winter transportation, they are actively preparing for next year's transportation to welcome the new high tide of industrial and agricultural production.

	At present, the ten-thousand-li Yangtze River shipping line is bustling with activity. Fleets laden with ore, coal, building materials, grain, agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides are transporting large quantities of materials needed for next year's production and construction to cities, industrial areas, and rural areas day and night. Since September, the throughput of various ports along the Yangtze River has been increasing, and the cargo volume on the entire line has been rising month by month.

	To welcome the new high tide of industrial and agricultural production next year, the broad masses of seafarers along the entire Yangtze River have broken the old rule of "sailing without repairing the ship" and are actively repairing and maintaining the ships, improving the transportation efficiency of the vessels. Shipyards in Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing, and other ports are undergoing expansion and reconstruction. The revolutionary workers along the entire line have expressed their determination to firmly carry out the great policy of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and to be good transportation soldiers for the socialist construction of the motherland.

	Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers of Dalian Port have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, earnestly studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, continuously raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, fully played the leading role of the working class, and powerfully promoted the development of production. By December 10, they had successfully completed the annual port throughput task.

	With the arrival of winter, the port's loading and unloading tasks have become even more arduous, and the working environment has become even more harsh. The revolutionary workers, with the heroic spirit of fighting against nature, have pooled their wisdom and created a set of advanced operating methods, greatly accelerating the turnover rate of vehicles and ships, and shortening the time ships stay in port.

    万里长江航运线上一片繁忙景象
    大连海港提前完成全年吞吐任务
    据新华社武汉电　长江航运公司广大革命职工在解放军支左人员帮助下，认真落实党的八届十二中全会公报提出的伟大任务，在做好冬季运输工作的同时，积极为明年的运输作准备，迎接工农业生产新高潮的到来。
    目前，在万里长江航线上，到处呈现一片繁忙的景象。满载着矿石、煤炭、建筑材料、粮食、农业机械、化肥和农药等货物的船队，昼夜不停地向城市、工矿区和农村运送明年生产建设所需的大批物资。九月份以来，长江沿线各港口的吞吐量不断增加，全线货运量逐月上升。
    为了迎接明年工农业生产高潮的到来，长江全线广大海员打破了“驾船不修船”的旧规矩，积极维修和保养船只，提高船舶的运输效率。宜昌、武汉、南京等港口的船厂正在进行扩建和续建。全线广大革命职工表示：坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，当好祖国社会主义建设的运输兵。
    据新华社沈阳十三日电　在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，大连海港广大革命职工，深入开展革命的大批判，认真学习两条路线斗争史，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，有力地推动了生产的发展，十二月十日已经胜利完成了全年港口吞吐任务。
    冬季到来之后，海港的装卸任务更加繁重，工作环境更加艰苦。广大革命职工以战天斗地的英雄气概，群策群力，创造了一套先进的作业方法，大大加速了车船周转率，缩短了船舶在港停留时间。
