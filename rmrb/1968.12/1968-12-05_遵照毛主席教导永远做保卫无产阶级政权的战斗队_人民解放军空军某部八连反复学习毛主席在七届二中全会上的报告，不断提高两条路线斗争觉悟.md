Over the past few years, the Eighth Company of a certain unit in the Air Force has taken Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," as the best teaching material for the struggle between the two lines. They have organized officers and soldiers to study it frequently and repeatedly, firmly establishing the idea of always being a combat team to consolidate and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Establishing the Idea of Always Being a Combat Team
	Preventing Imperialism, Revisionism, and Reactionaries from Subverting the Proletarian Dictatorship

The Party branch of the Eighth Company organized the officers and soldiers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "The state power of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, is not to be weakened but to be strengthened." They educated everyone to never forget the proletarian dictatorship and to firmly establish the idea that the People's Liberation Army is always a combat team. They set up a "warning board" next to their cannons, recording the crimes of every U.S. imperialist plane and warship that invaded our airspace and territorial waters, reminding everyone that imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are always dreaming of subverting our proletarian dictatorship. They combined this with the reality of class struggle, fiercely criticizing the running dogs of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three surrenders and one destruction." This made everyone realize that there has always been a fierce struggle between the two lines on the issue of dealing with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is a line of resolute struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can consolidate our proletarian dictatorship and defend the socialist mountains and rivers. Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is a line of surrender to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. If Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary plots were to succeed, it would lead to the destruction of the party and the nation. Through repeated study, everyone firmly established the idea of standing guard and fighting for life to defend the proletarian dictatorship.

	They followed Chairman Mao's great teachings on "The entire command and combat personnel of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting will." Regardless of the severe cold or scorching heat, they have been eating on the battlefield and living next to it for years, often sleeping in their clothes, and guarding their positions day and night. They said: The idea of defending the proletarian dictatorship cannot be forgotten for a single moment, and the idea of being a combat team cannot be relaxed for a single moment. The officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company firmly established the idea of always being a combat team. No matter when the enemy planes come, they will be severely punished. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one day, a U.S. imperialist plane invaded, and the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company discovered the enemy plane from a great distance. Within two seconds, they locked onto the target. As soon as the enemy plane entered the firing range, they coordinated with their brother units to launch a fierce attack, blowing the enemy plane to smithereens. Over the past decade, they have maintained high revolutionary vigilance, fighting to defend the proletarian dictatorship, and have shot down and damaged ten enemy planes belonging to the U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits.

	Establishing the Idea of Always Being a Combat Team
	Being Vigilant Against Enemies Without Guns Seizing the Proletarian Dictatorship

The Party branch of the Eighth Company also organized the officers and soldiers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." This made all the officers and soldiers in the company realize that we must not only prevent the attacks of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries but also be vigilant against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party seizing power. They often studied the history of the struggle between the two lines over the past few decades, especially since the founding of the nation, visited the achievements of the Red Guards in their garrison area and exhibitions on the struggle between the two lines, and invited comrades who participated in the "Three Supports and Two Militaria" to give reports. Through these activities, everyone realized that a handful of capitalist roaders within the party are the most dangerous enemies who have infiltrated the organs of the proletarian dictatorship. The number one capitalist roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi, is the representative of the reactionary forces who frantically promoted the bourgeois reactionary line and attempted to restore capitalism. Everyone said, Liu Shaoqi and imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are two poisonous snakes, one in the open and one in disguise. We must be vigilant not only against the snake that shows its fangs but also against the snake that disguises itself as a beautiful woman. Otherwise, even if we shoot down thousands of enemy planes, the power we seize will still be in danger of being lost. On the basis of raising awareness, all the comrades in the company took out the same spirit of fighting to the death with the U.S. and Kuomintang air pirates and launched a fierce attack on Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, initiating a high tide of revolutionary criticism. Deputy squad leader Fang Changgen, with his low cultural level, took up the brush to fight against the enemies without guns to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He overcame numerous difficulties to learn to draw slides, determined to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies and make them stink for a thousand years. He followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and drew more than ten sets of slides criticizing Liu Shaoqi. Brother units and local masses often invited him to participate in the revolutionary criticism battles, and everyone called him the "slide critic." The Eighth Company's revolutionary criticism was both spectacular and solid. They made Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" a daily criticism topic, constantly strengthening the officers and soldiers' class struggle awareness.

	The Party branch also organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "The army is the main component of state power," recognizing that the People's Liberation Army is the strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. They deeply studied the history of the struggle between the two lines in military building, highly praising the great wisdom of Chairman Mao's military line, thoroughly exposing and criticizing the crimes of the bourgeois military line, greatly enhancing the officers and soldiers' awareness of resolutely implementing and defending Chairman Mao's military line. Comrades said, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan frantically promoted the bourgeois military line with the reactionary purpose of making us pursue military technology alone, lose our political direction, and become their tools for restoring capitalism. We will not be fooled. Everyone is determined to further highlight proletarian politics, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticize the bourgeois military line promoted by Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, eliminate its poison, and make Chairman Mao's military line deeply rooted in the company.

	Establishing the Idea of Always Being a Combat Team
	Defeating the Attacks of the Bourgeois Sugar-Coated Cannonballs

For a period, the Eighth Company was on a mission in a big city. To resist the bourgeois "fragrant winds" and "poisonous mists" from society, the Party branch organized the officers and soldiers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on preventing the attacks of bourgeois sugar-coated cannonballs, using Chairman Mao's discussions on hard struggle as a weapon, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts. Everyone realized that only by firmly establishing the idea of always being a combat team can they take the initiative to attack the class enemies, smash the invasions of bourgeois sugar-coated cannonballs, stand firm, hold the gun, and defend the proletarian dictatorship.

	Over the past few years, they have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "We must make sure that comrades continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and impatience, and we must make sure that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." They resolutely resisted the invasions of bourgeois thoughts. Everyone is determined to struggle hard for life to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to defend and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. The officers and soldiers regard participating in productive labor as a battle to resist the invasions of bourgeois thoughts. They squeezed out every bit of time from their busy combat readiness and guard duties to participate in labor. When on duty on the mountain, where there are many stones and no land to till, the officers and soldiers take turns going down the mountain to clear the land and produce; when on duty in the city, where there is no land to farm, they take turns going to the farm to participate in labor. They also cut firewood, make brooms, repair camp equipment, cut hair, and mend clothes by themselves. The supply soldier Peng Yingyi walks more than twenty kilometers a day to buy vegetables, insisting on not hiring a car to pull, but carrying it himself with a shoulder pole. He carved "Serve the People" in shining golden letters on the shoulder pole, constantly urging himself. He wrote the magnificent lines: "Honor to join the army, shoulder the small shoulder pole; carry on the old tradition, the more you carry, the happier you are; loyal to Chairman Mao, revolutionary will is firm!" All the comrades in the company are determined to maintain the style of hard struggle for life and always be the vanguard fighters of continuing the revolution under the proletarian dictatorship!

	Recently, the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be frequently and repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people, it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses" and Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, determined to further seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines, raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and build the company into a company that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    遵照毛主席教导永远做保卫无产阶级政权的战斗队
    ——人民解放军空军某部八连反复学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟
    几年来，空军某部八连把伟大领袖毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这一光辉文献，作为两条路线斗争教育的最好教材，组织干部战士经常学，反复学，牢固树立为巩固和保卫无产阶级政权永远做一个战斗队的思想。
      树立永远是一个战斗队的思想
    防止帝、修、反颠覆无产阶级政权
    八连党支部组织指战员反复学习毛主席关于“工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化”的教导，教育大家念念不忘无产阶级专政，牢固树立人民解放军永远是一个战斗队的思想。他们在炮位旁设立“警告牌”，把美帝强盗飞机和军舰每次侵犯我国领空、领海的罪行，记录在上面，使大家念念不忘帝、修、反时刻都在梦想颠覆我国无产阶级专政。他们结合阶级斗争的现实，狠批帝、修、反的走狗刘少奇推行的“三降一灭”反革命修正主义路线，使大家认识到：在对待帝、修、反的问题上，一直存在着激烈的两条路线斗争。毛主席的革命路线是同帝、修、反坚决斗争到底的路线，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，就能巩固我国的无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义江山。刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线是向帝、修、反屈膝投降的路线，如果让刘少奇的反革命阴谋得逞，就会亡党亡国。经过反复学习，大家牢固树立了为保卫无产阶级政权站一辈子岗、打一辈子仗的思想。
    他们遵照毛主席关于“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”的伟大教导，不管严寒酷暑，长年吃在阵地上，住在阵地旁，经常穿着衣服睡觉，昼夜守在战位上。他们说：保卫无产阶级政权的观念一分一秒也不能忘，战斗队的思想一分一秒也不能松。八连指战员牢固树立了永远是一个战斗队的思想，不管敌机什么时候来，都遭到他们严厉的惩罚。在无产阶级文化大革命中，一天，美帝国主义强盗飞机入侵，八连指战员在很远的距离上就发现了敌机，两秒钟之内就抓住目标，敌机一进入火力圈，他们就和兄弟单位协同作战，猛烈射击，打得敌机粉身碎骨。十几年来，他们保持高度的革命警惕，为保卫无产阶级政权而战斗，先后击落击伤美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮飞机十架。
      树立永远是一个战斗队的思想
    警惕不拿枪的敌人篡夺无产阶级政权
    八连党支部还组织干部战士反复学习毛主席关于
  “在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人”的教导，使全连干部战士认识到：我们既要防止帝、修、反的进攻，更要警惕党内一小撮走资派篡夺政权。他们经常学习几十年来，特别是建国以来两条路线斗争的历史，参观驻地红卫兵战绩和两条路线斗争展览，请参加“三支”“两军”的同志作报告。通过这些活动，使大家认识到：党内一小撮走资派是钻进无产阶级专政机构内部的最危险的敌人。党内头号走资派刘少奇，就是疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线、妄图复辟资本主义的反动势力的总代表。大家说，刘少奇和帝、修、反是暗里和明里的两条毒蛇。我们不仅要警惕露出毒牙的毒蛇，更要警惕化成美女的毒蛇。不然，即使我们打下千架万架敌机，夺取的政权仍然有丧失的危险。在提高认识的基础上，全连同志拿出了同美蒋空中强盗死打硬拚的劲头，向刘少奇及其推行的反革命修正主义路线猛烈开炮，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。副班长方长根文化文平低，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，同不拿枪的敌人作斗争，主动拿起画笔，克服重重困难，学画幻灯片，决心把刘少奇的反革命修正主义谬论批深批透，让它遗臭万年。他紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，画了十多套批判刘少奇的幻灯片。兄弟连队和驻地群众经常请他去参加革命大批判的战斗，大家称他是“幻灯批判家”。八连的革命大批判既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。他们把刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”作为天天批判的内容，使干部战士不断增强阶级斗争观念。
    党支部还组织大家学习毛主席关于“军队是国家政权的主要成份”的教导，认识到人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。他们深入学习两条建军路线斗争的历史，大赞大颂毛主席建军路线的英明伟大，大揭大批资产阶级军事路线的罪恶，大大提高了干部战士坚决执行和誓死捍卫毛主席建军路线的自觉性。同志们说，反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿疯狂推行资产阶级军事路线的反动目的，就是妄图使我们单纯追求军事技术，迷失政治方向，成为他们复辟资本主义的工具。我们决不上当。大家决心更加坚定地突出无产阶级政治，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线，肃清其流毒，使毛主席的建军路线在连队深深扎根。
      树立永远是一个战斗队的思想
      击退资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻
    有一段时间，八连在一个大城市执行任务。为了抵制社会上资产阶级“香风”、“毒雾”的侵袭，党支部组织干部战士反复学习毛主席关于要预防资产阶级糖衣炮弹攻击的教导，以毛主席关于艰苦奋斗的论述为武器，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想。大家认识到，只有牢固树立永远是一个战斗队的思想，才能主动向阶级敌人进攻，粉碎资产阶级糖弹的侵袭，站稳脚跟，握紧枪杆，保卫无产阶级政权。
    几年来，他们一直牢记毛主席关于“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，坚决抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭。大家决心为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为保卫和巩固无产阶级政权，艰苦奋斗一生，和资产阶级思想战斗一生。干部战士把参加生产劳动，看作是击退资产阶级思想侵袭的战斗。他们在紧张的战备执勤中，挤出点滴时间参加劳动。在山上执勤，石多不能开荒，干部战士就轮流到山下开荒生产；在城市执勤，没有地种，他们就各班轮流到农场参加劳动。他们还自己动手打柴禾，扎扫帚，修营具，理发，补衣。给养员彭英毅，每天来回买菜要走路二十多公里，他坚持不雇车拉，自己用扁担挑。他在扁担上刻上“为人民服务”五个金光闪闪的大字，时刻鞭策自己。他写下了豪迈的诗句：“光荣把军参，肩挑小扁担；发扬老传统，越挑心越欢；忠于毛主席，革命斗志坚！”全连同志决心保持一辈子艰苦奋斗的作风，永远做无产阶级专政下继续革命的先锋战士！
    最近，八连指战员认真学习了毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，决心进一步认真学习两条路线的斗争史，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，把连队建设成无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的四好连队。
