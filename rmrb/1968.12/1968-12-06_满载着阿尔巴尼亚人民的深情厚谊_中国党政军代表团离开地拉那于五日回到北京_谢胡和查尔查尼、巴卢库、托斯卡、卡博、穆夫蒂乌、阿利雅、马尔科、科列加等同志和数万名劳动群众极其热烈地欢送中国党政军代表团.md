By a special plane, the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng, returned to Beijing on December 5 after participating in the 24th anniversary celebrations of Albania's liberation and a friendly visit to Albania.

On December 3, the Albanian people of the heroic capital, Tirana, with profound proletarian feelings for their comrades and fellow fighters, gave a very warm send-off to the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation. By 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, tens of thousands of people had already lined up on both sides of the streets leading to the airport. Workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers of the people's army, militia, government officials, students, and cultural workers held aloft portraits of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, waving the national flags of Albania and China, ribbons, and flowers, and shouting slogans of Sino-Albanian friendship to warmly see off their Chinese comrades.

The airport in Tirana was adorned with red flags. Above the airport building hung giant portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Chairman Mao. A red banner read: "Long Live Sino-Albanian Friendship!" The orchestra played the national anthems of both countries. Comrade Huang Yongsheng, the head of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, inspected the honor guard in the company of Comrade Mehmet Shehu and Comrade Beqir Balluku. Then, the entire delegation walked up to the crowd to wave goodbye. The crowd repeatedly shouted, "Enver-Mao," "Long Live Sino-Albanian Friendship!" A group of Young Pioneers presented flowers to the delegation members. The entire delegation took a group photo with Comrades Shehu, Kaba, Balluku, and others by the plane and warmly shook hands and embraced them in farewell.

When the plane, laden with the great friendship of the Albanian people for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Chinese government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and laden with the revolutionary friendship of the Albanian people for the Chinese people, slowly took off and left the heroic capital of Albania, the crowd cheered and shouted for a long time, "Long Live Sino-Albanian Friendship!"

On December 3, those who went to the airport to see off the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation also included Li Tingqian, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Military Attaché Li Zhongxuan, and embassy staff, Chinese engineering and technical personnel and students in Albania, and crew members of the Chinese ship "Dunhuang" docked in Albanian ports.

Also present at the airport to see off the delegation were diplomatic envoys from several countries stationed in Albania.
