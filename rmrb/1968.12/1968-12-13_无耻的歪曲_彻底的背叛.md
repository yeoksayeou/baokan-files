The Soviet revisionist newspaper *Pravda* recently published an article that extensively propagandized the "friendly relationship" between the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and the Indian reactionaries. It absurdly claimed that this counter-revolutionary collusion is a "brilliant embodiment and development" of Lenin's great principle of the friendship among peoples. This is a shameless distortion of Leninism by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, a gross insult to the great Lenin.

Lenin always advocated that the foreign policy of the proletariat is to "ally with the revolutionaries of advanced countries and all oppressed nations to oppose all imperialists." Lenin also emphasized that Marxists only support progressive nationalism; if this boundary is crossed to support reactionary nationalism, it is a betrayal of the proletariat. However, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique does the opposite. It colludes with U.S. imperialism to jointly support the Indian reactionaries, attempting to strangle the revolutionary struggle of the Indian people. Isn't this completely contrary to Leninism?

The author of the *Pravda* article desperately boasts about the Soviet revisionists' economic "aid" and technological "aid" to India. Indeed, the Soviet revisionists' economic "aid" to India is substantial, amounting to hundreds of billions of rubles. The Soviet revisionists have become the second-largest creditor to India, second only to U.S. imperialism. However, these "aids" are completely for maintaining the reactionary rule of the Indian reactionaries, serving the Indian landlords and big bourgeoisie, and also serving the despicable purpose of the Soviet revisionists plundering the Indian people. Through so-called economic "aid" and technological "aid," the Soviet revisionists export large amounts of capital and goods to India, controlling India's economy together with U.S. imperialism and reaping huge profits annually. The Soviet revisionists' economic infiltration and plunder of India are thorough and complete neo-colonialism. How can this have anything in common with the great Lenin's principles?

The author of the *Pravda* article also "overlooked" a fact: the Soviet revisionist renegade clique not only provides the Indian reactionaries with a large amount of economic "aid" but also supplies them with a large number of aircraft, tanks, warships, and other military equipment. The Soviet revisionists' military "aid" to the Indian reactionaries has surpassed U.S. imperialism and taken the first place. These military "aids" are all used to help the Indian reactionaries massacre the Indian revolutionary people, oppose socialist China from the outside, threaten other neighboring countries, and carry out aggressive expansion. Can the counter-revolutionary deeds of the Soviet revisionists be in line with Leninism?

Half a century ago, the great Lenin once severely criticized European imperialism for supporting the reactionary forces in Asia and colluding with the Chinese traitor Yuan Shikai. Lenin said: Imperialism "plunders China, helps the enemies of Chinese democracy and freedom." "Why does it support Yuan Shikai? Because it is a profitable opportunity." Lenin's words are an excellent portrayal of today's Soviet revisionist renegade clique. This gang of shameless traitors, for the interests of a small group of the bourgeoisie, supports the reactionary forces in India and colludes with the "Yuan Shikai of India." They have not only long since betrayed the great Lenin but have also precisely degenerated into the imperialists that Lenin criticized!

### 无耻的歪曲　彻底的背叛

    无耻的歪曲　彻底的背叛
    苏修《消息报》最近刊登了一篇文章，大肆宣扬苏修叛徒集团同印度反动派之间的“友好关系”，并且胡说这种反革命勾结是什么“伟大列宁关于各国人民友好的主张”的“光辉的证实和发展”。这是苏修叛徒集团对列宁主义的无耻歪曲，是对伟大列宁的莫大污辱。
    列宁从来主张，无产阶级的对外政策是“同先进国家的革命者和一切被压迫民族结成联盟，反对所有的帝国主义者”。列宁还强调指出，马克思主义者只支持进步的民族主义；如果超过这个界限去支持反动的民族主义，那就是背叛了无产阶级。可是苏修叛徒集团恰恰反其道而行之。它联合美帝国主义，共同扶植印度反动派，力图扼杀印度人民的革命斗争。这同列宁主义不是完全背道而驰的吗？
    《消息报》文章的作者拚命吹嘘苏修对印度的经济“援助”和技术“援助”。不错，苏修对印度的经济“援助”确实不少，有上百亿卢布。苏修已仅次于美帝成为印度的第二大债权国。但是，苏修的这些“援助”，完全是为维护印度反动派的反动统治服务的，是为印度的大地主、大资产阶级服务的，也是为苏修自己掠夺印度人民的卑鄙目的服务的。苏修通过所谓经济“援助”和技术“援助”，向印度输出大量资金和商品，同美帝一起控制了印度的经济，每年攫取巨额的利润。苏修对印度的这种经济渗透和掠夺，是彻头彻尾的新殖民主义，它同伟大列宁的主张那里有一丝一毫共同之处？
    《消息报》文章的作者还“忽略”了一个事实：苏修叛徒集团不仅给印度反动派大量经济“援助”，而且给他们大批的飞机、坦克、军舰和其他武器装备。苏修对印度反动派的军事“援助”，已经超过美帝国主义而占了第一位。这些军事“援助”都是用来帮助印度反动派对内屠杀印度革命人民，对外反对社会主义中国，威胁其它邻国，实行侵略扩张的。苏修所干的这种反革命勾当，难道也符合列宁主义吗？
    半个多世纪以前，伟大的列宁曾经痛斥欧洲帝国主义支持亚洲的反动势力，同中国的卖国贼袁世凯联合起来。列宁说：帝国主义“掠夺中国，帮助中国民主、自由的敌人”。“为什么它要拥护袁世凯呢？因为这是个有利可图的机会。”列宁的这些话，正是对今天苏修叛徒集团的绝妙写照。这一伙无耻的叛徒也正是为了一小撮资产阶级的利益，支持印度的反动势力，同“印度的袁世凯”联合起来。他们不仅早已背叛了伟大的列宁，而且恰恰是堕落成为列宁所痛斥的帝国主义者！
