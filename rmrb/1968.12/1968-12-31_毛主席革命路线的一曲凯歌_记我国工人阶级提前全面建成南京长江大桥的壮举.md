The roaring Yangtze River sings a song of victory, and trains traveling north and south convey the good news. As our great motherland is about to enter the radiant year of 1969, the broad masses of bridge builders in Nanjing, under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and inspired by his latest instructions, have completed the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge's highway bridge with the fastest speed and the highest quality. Thus, the largest modern bridge in China, designed and built by ourselves, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, has been fully completed and successfully opened to traffic!

This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
This is a triumphant song of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!
This is another bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

High-speed construction of the Nanjing Bridge to report good news to Chairman Mao

At the time of the national celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the magnificent Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge's railway bridge was successfully completed. The task of constructing the highway bridge was immediately placed before the bridge builders.

The highway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is nine miles long, with a bridge surface that can accommodate four large trucks side by side. Not only is the construction volume large, but the engineering quality requirements are also high. It was originally planned to be completed by July 1, 1969. However, the working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, actively responded to the call of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to act, broke through old frameworks, and decided to complete the highway bridge and fully build the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge by New Year's Day, 1969. A handful of class enemies fanned the flames and spread rumors, claiming that "New Year's Day opening is a daydream." Some conservative-minded people also calculated the construction period, the amount of work, and found countless difficulties, believing that the New Year's Day opening was simply unimaginable.

The working class, which has taken control of the leadership of bridge construction, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and struck a resounding blow against a handful of class enemies. They declared, "With Chairman Mao's leadership, no matter how great the difficulties, we can overcome them, and we can create any human miracle!"

"We must strive every minute and every second to complete the Nanjing Bridge as soon as possible, to report good news to Chairman Mao, and to bring glory to the socialist motherland!"

During the days and nights of constructing the highway bridge, the bridge builders, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, fought bravely with a strong sense of responsibility as the working class. In the early morning, on the high bridge surface, the bridge builders braved the biting cold wind, singing the majestic "East Is Red," and began a day's labor. At night, on the long bridge approach construction site, workers worked by lamplight. The roar of pile drivers, the horns of heavy trucks, the whistles of cranes, and the labor songs made the entire Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge construction site hot and boiling.

Just as the bridge builders were engaged in intense battles, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the invitation for workers' representatives from all over the country to go to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. Four workers from the bridge site, including Chen Jinshui, represented the bridge builders and were honored to go to Beijing, where they received a warm reception from the great leader Chairman Mao. This great piece of news spread like a spring breeze over the boiling Yangtze River Bridge construction site. Many workers were moved to tears, and many workers, recalling the past, were filled with emotions and could not sleep all night. They said with deep affection, "In the old society, the capitalists treated us workers like grass, trampling on us at will. The traitor Liu Shaoqi treated us workers as 'living tools,' striking us down mercilessly. Chairman Mao believes in us, the working class, and lets the working class lead everything. Chairman Mao supports us workers, and we must strive for Chairman Mao!"

They put their words into action, devoting all their energy to the revolution and production. In the battle to install the prestressed beams for the highway approach bridge, the tall gantry crane was blocked by the Jinchuan River running through the site. In the past, it was unthinkable to move a crane that was over fifty meters high and weighed over a hundred tons across the Jinchuan River in less than a day. However, the workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, came up with the idea of using large I-beams to support the trestle bridge, reinforcing it with stone and timber at both ends, and strengthening the trestle bridge. In just ten and a half hours, they safely moved the gantry crane across the river. On the bridge site, such miracles were countless.

On November 1, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, which was a great encouragement to the bridge builders who were striving for the New Year's Day opening of the highway bridge. The workers, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the communiqué as their driving force, launched a larger-scale campaign to seize the revolution and promote production. They overcame the early winter winds and cold, and after a few weeks of effort, successfully completed the pile foundation construction task.

Fighting to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

The latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The working class must lead everything," have been issued! It is like a clap of spring thunder, inspiring the bridge builders to stride forward onto the political stage of the superstructure to fight, criticize, and reform with the appearance of the working class.

The heroic bridge builders, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, entered the design office with a sign that read "Design Area, No Admittance," and conducted extensive investigations using class analysis methods. They used a large number of facts to vividly and powerfully criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of enterprise management by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. At the same time, they conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on all the rules and regulations of the bridge engineering office and put forward many rationalization suggestions and revolutionary measures, making the mass movement of fighting, criticizing, and reforming both vigorous and solid, greatly accelerating the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge.

However, every reform process led by the working class is permeated with sharp struggles between the two lines.

During the discussion on the design plan for the highway approach bridge, the bridge builders and revolutionary technicians, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, boldly proposed a plan to adopt a new and unique form with national characteristics—the double-curved arch bridge. They believed that the double-curved arch bridge is low in cost, saves materials, has a large load-bearing capacity, is aesthetically pleasing, and has unparalleled advantages for the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in a short period of time. However, the bourgeois technical "authorities" said, "The double-curved arch bridge is a new thing, with no experience, and it is unreliable to use it on a first-class bridge like the Yangtze River Bridge." They proposed a "high fill" plan, intending to use earth to build a slope to replace a long section of the highway approach bridge. This plan was labor-intensive, time-consuming, ugly in appearance, obstructed urban traffic, and would destroy a large number of farmlands.

The bridge builders clearly recognized this as a sharp struggle between the two lines and resolutely refuted the bourgeois technical "authorities'" nonsense, declaring, "Whether to adopt the double-curved arch bridge is a major issue of whether to follow our own bridge-building path and whether to build the highway bridge quickly, economically, and with high quality. We must support new things and pave the way for them!"

The working class's revolutionary plan received the full support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres.

The double-curved arch bridge used in the Nanjing Bridge indeed encountered many difficulties. It is multi-span continuous, built on a curve, has a large load-bearing capacity, and crosses the railway. The bourgeois technical "authorities" also blocked technical information. However, the bridge builders were not intimidated by these difficulties. They said, "With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome any difficulty." The bourgeois technical "authorities" blocked geological information, so they investigated point by point. Lacking experience in arch bridge construction, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "gaining experience and gradually promoting it," first built two experimental bridges to gradually accumulate experience. During the experiment, the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" changed the concrete mix ratio more than a hundred times and experimented for six months without results. The workers watched anxiously. They thought, if we continue like this, when will the bridge be completed? Inspired by Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the workers decided to do it themselves. Relying on their rich practical experience, they quickly determined the concrete mix ratio, increasing production by ten times and exceeding the original design standards. When the bourgeois technical "authorities" controlled the production power, the pile foundation construction took a year to complete only thirty-eight piles, and twelve were scrapped. After the workers took power, they produced twelve piles a day, and the progress in three days equaled a year's progress. The bridge builders, by emphasizing proletarian politics and launching mass movements, fought for sixty-nine days and finally completed the installation of twenty-two arch bridges.

One arch bridge after another was born in the fierce struggle between the two lines. Heavy trucks rushed back and forth on the arch bridge, and crowds of people strolled across the river along the arch bridge. Trains freely galloped under the arch bridge. The prestige of the bourgeois "authorities" was swept away. The proletarian bridge-building road became wider and wider.

The great cooperation of communism is fully displayed

The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed ahead of schedule, not only through the efforts of the bridge builders but also as a result of the outstanding achievements of the great cooperation of the working class under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Excellent construction workers from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Liaoning, Anhui, and various places in Jiangsu Province wrote one song after another of great cooperation of communism here.

"We are not here to support, but to participate in the construction of our own Yangtze River Bridge!" The construction workers from Jiangdu spoke the hearts of revolutionary workers from all over the country.

The working class of the whole country, with a strong sense of responsibility as masters, closely concerned and fully supported the early completion of the bridge. They said, "The construction of the Yangtze River Bridge is everyone's business, it is our working class's own business." The Shanghai Foundation Company's piling team came to the approach bridge construction site of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge to work, but there were no mechanical equipment to help with unloading. They learned from the bridge builders' spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, taking the piling machine off the train piece by piece and assembling it piece by piece on the site, immediately joining the battle. The geological conditions by the river were complex, and they encountered many difficulties during piling. They studied Chairman Mao's works actively, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, overcame countless difficulties, improved operations, and increased work efficiency, winning time for the next construction phase. The Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory was responsible for the supply of materials for the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. When the highway bridge of the Yangtze River Bridge needed to weld a special type of steel into steel beams due to partial design changes, a so-called "national welding expert" asserted that "this steel cannot be welded." The workers of the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory said, "What cannot be welded! The steel beams needed for the Yangtze River Bridge, even if it were stone, we would make it weld!" They innovated technology, daringly experimented, and welded the steel beams in time, ensuring the needs of the Yangtze River Bridge.

The battle to seize the early completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge also inspired the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, cadre officials, and Red Guards in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City. They all wanted to contribute to the bridge construction, to sweat, and to use all available time to actively participate in the voluntary labor on the bridge site. The volunteer labor army from various factories, people's communes, offices, and schools numbered in the thousands every day. One night, it was already past eleven o'clock, and a group of sixteen- or seventeen-year-old female Red Guards, carrying their own food, walked more than twenty miles from Nanjing City to the bridge site, requesting to participate in voluntary labor. They excitedly told the site responsible comrades, "We have already signed up to support the border areas and will soon settle down in Inner Mongolia. Please allow us to contribute to the Yangtze River Bridge before we leave!" Their labor enthusiasm was very high, and they worked all night.

The great victory of the early completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the result of countless working people and Red Guards, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely love the socialist construction of the motherland, with their hard-working sweat and red hearts. They have written a brilliant chapter for the socialist construction of the great motherland, created a great miracle in bridge-building history, and fully demonstrated the boundless creativity of the Chinese working people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛主席革命路线的一曲凯歌
    ——记我国工人阶级提前全面建成南京长江大桥的壮举
    奔腾万里的长江高奏凯歌，南来北往的列车传递喜讯。在我们伟大祖国即将进入光辉灿烂的一九六九年的时候，南京长江大桥广大建桥工人，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，以最快的速度，最好的质量，胜利地完成了南京长江大桥公路桥的施工任务。
    至此，我国自行设计、自行建造的最大的现代化桥梁南京长江大桥，已经全部建成并胜利通车了！
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一曲凯歌！
    这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果！
  高速建好南京桥，向毛主席报喜
    在举国欢庆中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，雄伟壮丽的南京长江大桥铁路桥胜利建成了。公路桥的施工任务马上摆到了建桥工人的面前。
    南京长江大桥的公路桥，长达九华里，桥面要能并排行驶四辆大卡车，不仅施工量大，而且工程质量要求高，原定一九六九年七月一日才能建成。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，积极响应江苏省革命委员会的号召，发扬敢想、敢干的无产阶级革命精神，打破旧框框，决定把修好公路桥，全面建成南京长江大桥的时间提前到一九六九年元旦。一小撮阶级敌人煽阴风，点鬼火，散布流言蜚语，胡说什么：“元旦通车是白日做梦。”有些思想保守的人也扳着指头算工期，算工程量，算来算去，这困难，那困难，认为元旦通车简直不可设想。
    掌握了大桥建设领导大权的工人阶级，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迎头痛击了一小撮阶级敌人。他们豪迈地说：“有毛主席的领导，天大的困难能克服，什么人间奇迹都可以创造！”
      “我们一定要争分争秒，早日全面建成南京桥，向毛主席报喜，为社会主义祖国增光！”
    在建设公路桥的日日夜夜里，建桥工人怀着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，以工人阶级的高度责任感，奋勇作战。清晨，在高耸入云的桥面上，建桥工人冒着凛冽的寒风，高唱着雄壮的《东方红》，开始了一天的劳动。深夜，绵延十几里的引桥工地上，工人群众挑灯夜战。打桩机的轰鸣，载重车的喇叭声，起重机起吊的哨音，劳动的号子，使南京长江大桥整个工地热火朝天，一片沸腾。
    正当建桥工人投入紧张战斗的时刻，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准邀请全国各地工人代表赴京参加国庆观礼。大桥工地的陈金水等四位工人，代表建桥工人，光荣地来到北京，受到了伟大领袖毛主席的亲切接见。这一特大喜讯，象浩荡的春风吹遍了沸腾的长江大桥工地。多少工人心潮澎湃喜泪流，多少工人抚今忆昔，思潮起伏，彻夜不眠。他们无限深情地说：“在旧社会，资本家把我们工人当棵草，任意摧残。大工贼刘少奇把我们工人当‘活工具’，肆意打击。毛主席最相信我们工人阶级，叫工人阶级领导一切。毛主席为我们工人阶级撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！”
    他们说到做到，把自己的全部精力用到了抓革命、促生产上。在架设公路引桥的预应力梁的战斗中，架梁用的高大龙门吊机被横穿工地的金川河挡住了。过去，要在不到一天的时间内叫五十多米高、一百多吨重的龙门吊机通过金川河，资产阶级技术“权威”想都不敢想。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人群众，想出了用大型工字梁支撑栈桥、两头用片石和道木撑住的办法，加固栈桥，仅用十个半小时的时间，就让龙门吊机安全地通了过去。在大桥工地上，象这样的奇迹数也数不清。
    十一月一日，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了，这对正在争取公路桥元旦通车的建桥工人，是一个巨大的鼓舞。工人群众以毛主席的最新指示和公报为动力，掀起了更大规模的抓革命、促生产新高潮。他们战胜了初冬的狂风寒流，经过几个星期的努力，胜利地完成了桥墩施工任务。
  为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示“工人阶级必须领导一切”发表了！它象一声春雷，鼓舞着建桥工人昂首阔步登上上层建筑领域斗、批、改的政治舞台，以工人阶级的面貌改造一切。
    英雄的建桥工人，带着毛主席的最新指示，进驻了挂有“设计重地闲人莫入”牌的设计处，用阶级分析的方法，大搞调查研究。他们用这个技术“禁地”脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产实际，脱离工人群众的大量事实，生动有力地批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义办企业路线。同时，他们对大桥工程处所有部门的各种规章制度进行了广泛深入的讨论，提出了许多合理化建议和革命化措施，使斗、批、改的群众运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实地开展起来，大大加快了长江大桥的建设速度。
    但是，工人阶级领导的每一个改革过程，都贯穿着尖锐的两条路线的斗争。
    在讨论公路引桥设计方案时，用毛泽东思想武装起来的建桥工人和革命的技术人员，大胆提出了采用富有民族特色的新颖形式——双曲拱桥的方案。他们认为，双曲拱桥造价低、用料省，载重量大，形式美观，对多快好省建设南京长江大桥，有着无比的优越性。但是资产阶级技术“权威”却说什么“双曲拱桥是个新东西，没有经验，用在长江大桥这样的第一流桥梁上靠不住。”他们提出了一个“高填土”的方案，想用泥土垒成斜坡，代替很长一段公路引桥。这个方案费工费时，外观难看，阻塞城市交通，而且要破坏大批农田。
    建桥工人明确地认识到这是一场尖锐的两条路线斗争，他们坚决驳斥了资产阶级技术“权威”的谰言，斩钉截铁地说：“采用不采用双曲拱桥，是走不走自己建桥道路，要不要多快好省地建成公路桥的大问题。对新生事物，我们就是要支持，就是要为它鸣锣开道！”工人阶级的革命方案，得到了人民解放军支左人员的全力支持。
    双曲拱桥用在南京大桥，确实碰到了不少困难。它多孔连续，建造在弯道上，载重量大，又横跨铁路，资产阶级技术“权威”还封锁技术资料。但是，建桥工人们没有被这些困难所吓倒。他们说：“有了毛泽东思想，我们什么困难都能克服。”资产阶级技术“权威”封锁地质资料，他们就一个点一个点地摸，缺乏拱桥的施工经验，他们就遵照毛主席“取得经验，逐步推广”的教导，先造两孔试验桥，逐渐积累经验。在试验过程中，资产阶级“专家”“权威”们把混凝土的配合比改动了一百多次，试验了六个月之久，仍然没有结果。工人看在眼里，急在心里。他们想，照这样干，大桥那天才能建成？在毛主席的革命路线鼓舞下，工人们决心自己干。他们凭着丰富的实践经验，很快确定了混凝土的配合比，产量提高了十倍，质量超过了原设计标准。资产阶级技术“权威”控制生产大权时，灌注桩施工一年时间只完成了三十八根，还报废了十二根。工人掌权后，一天就生产十二根，三天等于一年的进度。建桥工人靠突出无产阶级政治，大搞群众运动，大战六十九天，终于完成了二十二孔拱桥的架设任务。
    一孔孔拱桥在激烈的两条路线斗争中胜利诞生了。载重卡车在拱桥上往来疾驶，熙熙攘攘的群众，沿着拱桥信步过江，列车在拱桥下自由地驰骋。资产阶级“权威”老爷的威风扫地了。无产阶级的建桥道路越走越宽广。
    共产主义大协作大发扬
    南京长江大桥提前全面建成，不仅是建桥工人的努力，而且是在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，全国工人阶级大协作的杰出成果。来自北京、上海、天津、广东、辽宁、安徽以及江苏省各地的优秀建筑工人，在这里写下了一曲曲共产主义大协作的凯歌。
      “我们不是来支援的，而是来参加建设我们自己的长江大桥的！”来自江都的建筑工人说出了各地革命职工的心里话。
    全国工人阶级怀着高度主人翁的责任感，密切关心和全力支持大桥的早日建成。他们说：“长江大桥的建设是大家的事，是我们工人阶级自己的事。”上海基础公司打桩队来到南京长江大桥引桥工地施工，没有机械设备帮助卸装。他们学习建桥工人自力更生、奋发图强的精神，把打桩机从火车上一个零件一个零件地拆下来，在工地上一个零件一个零件地安装好，立即投入了战斗。江边地质情况复杂，打桩时遇到的困难很大，他们就活学活用毛主席著作，以愚公移山的精神克服了重重困难，改进操作，提高工效，为下道工序施工争得了时间。山海关桥梁厂担负着南京长江大桥建设物资的供应任务。当长江大桥公路桥由于部分设计的改动，需要将一种特殊钢材焊接成钢梁的时候，一位所谓“全国电焊专家”断言“这种钢材不能焊接”。山海关桥梁厂的工人群众说：“什么不能焊接！长江大桥需要的钢梁，就是石头我们也要叫它焊起来！”他们革新技术，大胆试验，及时焊好钢梁，保证了长江大桥的需要。
    夺取南京长江大桥提前全面建成的战斗也鼓舞着江苏地区和南京市的工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员、机关干部和红卫兵小将。他们争着要为大桥建设出一点力，流一点汗，利用一切可以利用的时间，积极争取参加大桥工地的义务劳动。来自各工厂、人民公社、机关、学校的义务劳动大军，每天有几千人之多。有一天，已经是晚上十一点多钟，一批十六、七岁的女红卫兵小将，自带干粮，从南京城步行二十多里来到大桥工地，要求参加义务劳动。她们激动地对工地负责同志说：“我们已经报名支援边疆，过几天就要到内蒙古安家落户了，请允许我们在出发之前，为长江大桥贡献一点力量吧！”她们的劳动热情十分高涨，整整干了一个通宵。
    南京长江大桥提前全面建成的伟大胜利，就是无数这样的无限忠于毛主席、无限热爱祖国社会主义建设事业的工农兵群众和红卫兵小将，用他们辛勤劳动的汗水和红心换来的。他们为伟大祖国的社会主义建设写下了光辉的诗篇，创造了建桥史上的伟大奇迹，充分显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国劳动人民的无穷无尽的创造力。
