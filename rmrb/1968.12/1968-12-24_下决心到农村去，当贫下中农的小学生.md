Title: Resolutely Go to the Countryside to Become a Student of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

I am a graduate of this year. Just as I was waiting for the state to assign me a job, our great leader Chairman Mao issued new instructions, once again pointing out the revolutionary direction for us young intellectuals. I resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, determined to go to the countryside, accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and be a lifelong student of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is necessary for young intellectuals to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and others to send their children who have graduated from junior high, senior high, and university to the countryside. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Every word of Chairman Mao's instructions has touched our hearts. Chairman Mao's new instructions are the greatest concern, the greatest care, and the greatest encouragement for us young intellectuals.

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "If you do not understand what class is, if you do not understand what exploitation is, then you do not understand revolution." I was born in a peasant family and grew up in a poor peasant household. Before liberation, my mother was forced to work as a maid for a landlord for more than ten years, suffering immense oppression and exploitation from the landlord class. It was Chairman Mao who liberated us poor and lower-middle peasants, allowing us to become masters of our own homes; it was Chairman Mao who sent me to university, something our ancestors could only dream of. Parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer; the river is deep, the sea is deep, but Chairman Mao's kindness is the deepest. I will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness, and I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao in revolution to the end.

Although I come from a poor peasant family, from the countryside to the city, from primary school to university, I have been poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the great traitor, great spy, and great renegade Liu Shaoqi, especially by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideas such as "studying to become an official." Unknowingly, I have been infected with bourgeois thoughts, lost my poor peasant nature, and always wanted to become a "specialist" or an "engineer," to achieve fame and fortune. With such thoughts, my feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants became more and more distant. Sometimes, when I returned to my hometown, I found the revolutionary style of the poor and lower-middle peasants, who are thrifty and simple, hard to accept; I was afraid of dirt and hard work, and participated less in labor. The poor and lower-middle peasants said that even my way of speaking had changed, and if I continued like this, I would fall into the pit of revisionism. Thinking about it, this is how dangerous it is!

Today, although I have graduated from university, in the eyes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I am still an ungraduated student. True graduation depends on whether I, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants; whether I undergo a thorough transformation, shifting my standpoint to the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao has issued new instructions, and I resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, determined to immediately pack my bags and go to the countryside, take the poor and lower-middle peasants as my teachers, and be a lifelong student of the poor and lower-middle peasants, accepting re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly changing my old thoughts, and forging myself into a socialist-conscious, cultured laborer.

	The broad masses of young intellectuals in Qingdao, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, go to the countryside to settle down and build socialist new rural areas. The young people are full of enthusiasm and are about to set off for the vast countryside. This is a group of young intellectuals going to the countryside to settle down, bidding farewell to their families who came to see them off.

### 下决心到农村去，当贫下中农的小学生

    下决心到农村去，当贫下中农的小学生
    哈尔滨工业大学六八年应届毕业生　张天福
    我是今年应届毕业生。正当我等待国家分配的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示，给我们知识青年再一次指明了革命的方向。我坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，决心到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，当一辈子贫下中农的小学生。
    毛主席教导我们：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”毛主席他老人家的话，一字一句都说到了我们的心坎里。毛主席的最新指示，是对我们知识青年最大的关怀，最大的爱护，最大的鞭策。
    林副主席指示我们说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”我生长在农村，出身在一个贫农家庭。我母亲在解放前被迫给地主当了十多年丫头，受尽地主阶级的压迫和剥削。是毛主席解放了我们贫下中农，使我们贫下中农当家做了主人；是毛主席他老人家又送我上了大学，这是我们祖祖辈辈梦想不到的事。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如毛主席的恩情深，我一辈子忘不了毛主席的恩情，我要永远忠于毛主席，跟着毛主席革命到底。
    我虽然出身于贫农家庭，但是，由农村到城市，从小学、中学到大学，却受了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，尤其是受了刘少奇的“读书做官论”等反革命修正主义思想的影响，不知不觉地沾染了资产阶级思想，丢掉了贫下中农的本色，一心想当“专家”、“工程师”，“成名成家”。有了这种思想，和贫下中农的感情也就越来越疏远。有时，我回到家乡，对贫下中农那种勤俭朴实的革命作风，就有些看不惯；自己嫌脏怕累，参加劳动也少。贫下中农说我连讲话的腔调都变了，再这样下去，就要掉进修正主义的泥坑了。想起来，这是多么危险啊！
    今天我虽然大学毕业了，但在贫下中农面前，我还是一个没有毕业的小学生。真正的毕业，要看我是不是在毛泽东思想指引下，接受贫下中农的再教育；是不是来一个脱胎换骨的改造，把立足点移到贫下中农一边来。
    毛主席发出了最新指示，我坚决响应毛主席的号召，决心立即打起背包到农村去，拜贫下中农为师，甘当贫下中农的小学生，接受贫下中农的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，把自己锻炼成一个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。（附图片）
    青岛市广大知识青年，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，到农村去安家落户，建设社会主义新农村。青年们意气风发，即将奔赴农村广阔的天地。这是去农村安家落户的知识青年正向送行的家长告别。
