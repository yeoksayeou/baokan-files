A triumphant song shakes the sky, and millions celebrate a new leap forward—recording the revolutionary masses of the capital enthusiastically cheering the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test.

An east wind carries the good news, and snowflakes fly ten thousand miles to bring the victory report. In the midst of the fervent struggle, criticism, and reform, as the year 1968, laden with the fruits of the Cultural Revolution, is about to pass, and the even more glorious year 1969 is about to arrive, another piece of heart-stirring news has come: China has successfully detonated another hydrogen bomb!

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Instantly, cheers, songs, gongs, drums, and firecrackers echoed through the night sky of Beijing. Squad after squad of joyous messengers, wave after wave of celebratory crowds, braving the biting cold of the winter night and the falling snow, carried high the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, singing and dancing, overflowing with joy, surging onto the streets, towards Zhongnanhai, towards Tiananmen Square.

The lights of Tiananmen Square illuminated the night sky, and buildings far and near were adorned with colorful lanterns. The jubilant crowds, facing the falling snow, sang their hearts out in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait. Not long ago, people had gathered here to sing in celebration of the publication of the report of the 12th Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, and the expulsion of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party. Now, after China's successful hydrogen bomb test, the capital city of Beijing, home to 700 million heroes, is once again immersed in an ocean of unparalleled happiness and joy.

More than 200 passengers from various ethnic groups, including Han, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, danced in celebration of Chairman Mao's eternal life under the Tiananmen Gate Tower and in front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao.

The soldiers of a certain company of the Beijing Garrison Command, who stand guard day and night in front of Tiananmen, expressed their resolve in front of the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao at the Tiananmen Gate Tower: "We stand at Tiananmen, with the world in our hearts. We must never forget class struggle and must definitely raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We will deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines, raise our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to a new height, and in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, we will perform new deeds for the people."

When the propaganda vehicle arrived at Tiananmen to distribute the special edition of the People's Daily printed for this great news, the joy of the people immediately reached a new boiling point. Several workers who had just finished their night shift automatically lined up in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait and took an oath: "We will definitely ride the great east wind of this special news, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything we do, and while transforming the objective world, continuously transform our subjective world. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, 'in struggle, continuously raise our political awareness,' we will better shoulder the great historical mission given to us by Chairman Mao to lead everything as the working class."

The news spread, and without orders or calls, the workers of the Beijing New China Printing House, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, spontaneously gathered from the workshops, dormitories, and family quarters in the snow, jumping and singing, freely cheering! The teams to report to Zhongnanhai set off. The teams to propagate at Tiananmen, Chang'an Street, and the family quarters set off. Revolutionary workers deeply felt in revolutionary practice: the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb of unparalleled power. With Mao Zedong Thought as our spiritual atomic bomb, the Chinese people can produce material atomic and hydrogen bombs, striking another blow against the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail policies of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Workers in the flat printing workshop expressed their determination to print more copies of Chairman Mao's Little Red Book and colored portraits of Chairman Mao, sending them to the five continents and four seas to inspire the revolutionary people of the world. The machines spun faster, and the workers worked more enthusiastically. After a night of hard work, the daily output of this workshop increased by 38.8%.

The news reached the Beijing Instrument Factory, which had completed its 1968 production plan 45 days ahead of schedule, greatly boosting the revolutionary workers' sky-high enthusiasm for seizing the revolution and promoting production. In the past days, the revolutionary committee of the factory and the workers, inspired by the report of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. They proposed to develop the DM300 plating machine as a gift for the 9th Party Congress. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, crawling step by step behind others. We must break the rules and adopt advanced technology as much as possible to build our country into a modernized socialist power in a not too long historical period." They kicked out foreign dogmas, formed a three-in-one combination of workers, revolutionary cadres, and technical personnel, designed and worked simultaneously. When they encountered difficulties, they sat down to study Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly researched, and repeatedly practiced, finally successfully developing the DM300 plating machine in less than a month. Inspired by the news of the successful hydrogen bomb explosion, they redoubled their revolutionary enthusiasm and resolved to complete 11 DM300 plating machines before the end of the year.

The news reached the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Beijing, who were overjoyed and determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution in rural areas! The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Huangtugang People's Commune expressed their determination to learn from the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, and scientific workers engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons. They vowed to seize the revolution and promote production. That night, they offered suggestions and resolved to complete the nearly 100-mile-long major irrigation canal ahead of schedule.

Inspired by the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, several young intellectuals who had just been approved to settle in Shanxi Province on the same day they were named, heard the joyous news of China's successful detonation of a new hydrogen bomb. They enthusiastically expressed: "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has opened up the path to victory for us. We will definitely, in the process of being re-educated by the poor and lower-middle peasants, like the researchers and testers of nuclear weapons, open up a new world for socialist agriculture."

When the good news reached Beijing Station, passengers on the 35th train bound for Xining were boarding. As soon as everyone heard that China had successfully detonated another hydrogen bomb, the entire train and platform immediately boiled over. A revolutionary cadre from a village, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly said: "Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we exposed the villain Liu Shaoqi; relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fought against nature and achieved a bumper harvest this year. Now China has successfully tested a new hydrogen bomb! This is joy upon joy! We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely, in 1969, continue to implement Chairman Mao's great policy of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production,' achieve greater victories in revolution and production, and use practical actions to welcome the successful convening of the 9th National Congress of the Party."

It was already deep into the night, and the snow had covered the earth in a silver robe. At the places where the good news was distributed, people bustled about; some, upon receiving the good news, rushed away; some workers who had just finished their night shift and passed by, put down their bicycles, spontaneously organized themselves, and helped distribute the news; many Red Guards took the good news they received and distributed it to passengers who had just gotten off the train.

Everyone, facing the dawn, walked from house to house, delivering the good news to everyone's heart. The resounding gongs and drums, the joyous songs, echoed louder and louder in the sky above the capital.

    一曲凯歌震长空　万众欢庆新飞跃
    ——记首都革命群众热烈欢呼我国新的氢弹试验成功
    浩荡东风传喜讯，万里飞雪迎捷报。
    在热火朝天的斗、批、改高潮中，在满载着文化大革命累累战果的一九六八年即将告别，新的更加光辉的一九六九年即将来临的时刻，又传来了一个振奋人心的特大喜讯：我国又一颗氢弹爆炸成功了！
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”霎时间，欢呼声、歌声、锣鼓声、鞭炮声，响彻北京的夜空。一支支报喜的队伍，一队队欢庆的人群，冒着隆冬之夜刺骨的寒风，披着纷纷扬扬的瑞雪，高擎着毛主席的巨幅画像，载歌载舞，欢欣若狂，涌向街头，涌向中南海，涌向天安门广场。
    天安门广场的灯火映红了夜空，远近的建筑物上彩灯齐放。欢腾的人群迎着飞雪，在伟大领袖毛主席像前尽情地歌唱。不久前，人们为党的十二中全会公报的发表，为无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，为把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党而聚集在这里歌唱。现在，在我国成功地进行了新的氢弹试验以后，七亿英雄人民的首都北京城啊，又一次沉浸在无比幸福、无比欢乐的海洋里。
    来自祖国四面八方的汉、蒙、回、藏等民族的二百多名旅客，在天安门城楼下，在毛主席巨幅画像前，跳起了敬祝毛主席万寿无疆的舞蹈。
    日夜守卫在天安门前的北京卫戍区某部一连指战员，在天安门城楼前向伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像表达自己的决心：我们身在天安门，胸怀全世界，要念念不忘阶级斗争，一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟提到新高度，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中为人民立新功。
    当宣传车来到天安门前散发《人民日报》为这一特大喜讯而赶印的喜报时，欢乐的人们的感情立即达到了沸腾的新高度。十几个刚下夜班的工人读完喜报，自动排成一列，在伟大领袖毛主席像前宣誓：我们一定要乘着特大喜讯的浩荡东风，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的一切，在改造客观世界的同时，不断改造自己的主观世界，按照毛主席的教导，“在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”，更好地担负起毛主席交给的工人阶级领导一切的伟大历史使命。
    喜讯传来，没有命令，没人召唤，无限忠于毛主席的北京新华印刷厂的革命职工，不约而同地从车间，从宿舍，从家属区汇集在雪地里，跳啊，唱啊，尽情地欢呼！到中南海报喜的队伍出发了。到天安门、长安街、家属区宣传的队伍出发了。广大革命职工在革命的实践中深深地体会到：战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是威力无比的精神原子弹，有了毛泽东思想这个精神原子弹武装头脑，中国人民就能造出物质的原子弹、氢弹，又一次打击了美帝、苏修的核垄断、核讹诈政策。平印车间工人们表示，要印制更多的毛主席红宝书和毛主席彩色画像，送到五洲四海，鼓舞世界革命人民前进。机器转得飞快，工人干得更欢。经过连夜奋战，这个车间日产量提高了百分之三十八点八。
    喜讯传到提前四十五天完成一九六八年生产计划的北京仪器厂，极大地鼓舞了全厂革命职工抓革命促生产的冲天干劲。在过去的日子里，厂革委会和工人们在八届十二中全会公报鼓舞下，狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇所推行的反革命修正主义路线，提出试制DM300镀膜机，作为迎接“九大”的献礼。他们遵照毛主席“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国”的教导，踢开洋教条，组成工人、革命干部、技术人员三结合小组，一边设计一边干。遇到困难，就坐下来学习毛主席著作，反复研究，反复实践，终于在不到一个月的时间里就试制成功了。在氢弹爆炸成功的喜讯鼓舞之下，他们革命干劲倍增，决心年前就制好十一台DM300镀膜机。
    喜讯传来，京郊广大贫下中农欢欣鼓舞，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取农村无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！黄土岗人民公社的贫下中农和革命干部纷纷表示，要向从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军指战员、工程技术人员、科学工作者学习，要狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们在当晚献策献计，决心要把正在修建的一条近百里长的大干渠提前建成。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示鼓舞下，几个报名到山西省安家落户刚刚被批准的知识青年，在他们大喜的日子里，又听到祖国成功地爆炸了一颗新的氢弹的喜讯。他们满怀激情地表示：战无不胜的毛泽东思想为我们开辟了通向胜利的航道，我们一定在接受贫下中农再教育的过程中，象核武器研制和试验人员那样，去开辟社会主义农业的新天地。
    喜报送到北京站时，开往西宁的三十五次列车的旅客们正在上车。大家一听到我国又一颗氢弹爆炸成功，整个列车、整个站台顿时沸腾起来了。一位来自农村的革命干部手捧《毛主席语录》激动地说：“我们靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，揪出了刘少奇这个大坏蛋；靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想与天斗、与地斗，夺取了今年农业特大丰收。现在我国又一颗新的氢弹试验成功了！这真是喜上加喜！我们贫下中农一定要在一九六九年里，继续贯彻执行毛主席的‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大方针，夺取革命和生产更大胜利，用实际行动来迎接党的第九次代表大会的胜利召开。”
    夜已很深了，飞雪为大地披上了一身银装。在散发喜报的地方，人们熙熙攘攘，有的接到喜报飞奔而去；有些刚刚下夜班路过的工人，放下自行车，自动组织起来，帮着散发；许多红卫兵小将把自己领到的喜报去分发给刚刚下火车的客人。
    大家迎着黎明的晨曦，走千家，传万户，把喜报送到每一个人的心上。震响的锣鼓，欢乐的歌声，越来越响亮地回荡在首都的上空。
