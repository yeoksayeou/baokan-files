The heinous Liu Shaoqi is a faithful lackey of the Kuomintang reactionaries and a brother-in-arms of Chiang Kai-shek. For decades, he has been in the revolutionary ranks but his heart has been with Chiang Kai-shek. From his arrogant cry of a "peaceful democratic new stage," it is completely exposed that Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, has betrayed the nation, betrayed the revolution, and acted as a faithful lackey of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, revealing his ugly face.

During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek hid in the Emei Mountains, watching from the sidelines. In 1945, as soon as the guns of the War of Resistance fell silent, Chiang Kai-shek swaggered down from the mountains, wanting to pick the fruits of victory and seize the fruits of the War of Resistance. The War of Resistance was brilliantly led by Chairman Mao, and the fruits of victory were won by the blood and sacrifice of the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek wanted to seize them, but the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people would never agree. The unrepentant Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, was sharpening his knives, preparing to launch a full-scale civil war to annihilate the Communist Party and the people's army; on the other hand, he staged a peace charade, hoping to deceive us. Under the instigation of his American imperialist master, Chiang Kai-shek raised the black flag of "peace" and put on a farce of "peace." Chairman Mao saw through Chiang Kai-shek's tricks at a glance and clearly pointed out: "Chiang Kai-shek is determined to seize every inch of power and every bit of gain from the people. As for us, our policy is to meet force with force, to fight for every inch of land. ... Now Chiang Kai-shek is sharpening his knives, so we must also sharpen our knives." Chairman Mao issued a new battle mobilization order to the people of the whole country. However, at this critical moment, the Kuomintang's lackey Liu Shaoqi, who was hidden within the Party, jumped out and put forward the reactionary fallacy of a "peaceful democratic new stage," openly opposing Chairman Mao. What was Liu Shaoqi up to? Whom was he working for? Let us use ironclad historical facts to expose Liu Shaoqi's traitorous face and pierce through his evil intentions in advocating a "peaceful democratic new stage."

When Liu Shaoqi was whitewashing the Kuomintang reactionaries, what were the Kuomintang reactionaries doing? Chairman Mao pointed out the crux of the matter: "The Kuomintang is negotiating with us on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is actively attacking the liberated areas." The facts are exactly like this. At that time, we were stationed in Zichuan, Shandong, only two li away from the Kuomintang bandit troops' garrison. We could see their every move and action clearly. Under the cover of Chiang Kai-shek's "peace" slogan, batch after batch of Kuomintang troops were advancing towards us, seizing our liberated areas on the one hand and provoking us militarily on the other. The enemy set up layer upon layer of sentry posts around our garrison, imposing a blockade and siege on us. The bandit sentries all had their swords drawn and bullets in the chamber, with their sword blades and gun muzzles pointed straight at us. Witnessing the enemy's "peace" trick, everyone was filled with indignation. What kind of robbers' "peace" is this? We had never seen such thieves' "goodwill"! We strictly followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "meeting force with force," and for every two sentries they sent, we set up four layers of sentry posts; for every light machine gun they used, we set up mortars. We fought for every inch of land and did not give an inch. Once, the bandits went berserk and shot our sentry without provocation. We were filled with vengeful anger and mobilized the local people to hold a denunciation meeting, exposing Chiang Kai-shek's plot of false peace and true civil war. The facts deeply educated the broad masses and also educated us. The enemy in front of us was a wolf, and all the Kuomintang bandit troops in the country were the same. The louder Chiang Kai-shek shouted the slogan of "peace," the louder the sound of civil war cannon fire became. The Kuomintang bandit troops near our garrison never stopped attacking us and never relaxed their efforts to seize the fruits of victory from us. This fully proves that "peace" is Chiang Kai-shek's war call, and "democracy" is his cloak for slaughtering the people. At this critical juncture of deciding between two destinies, Liu Shaoqi and American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek sang in unison, responding to each other's calls, singing the black play of "peace and democracy." What evil intentions did they have? It is self-evident that Liu Shaoqi thought what Chiang Kai-shek thought, said what Chiang Kai-shek said, and did what Chiang Kai-shek did. He wanted us to lay down our guns, kneel before American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, and hand over our country's vast territory to the enemy, giving the fruits of the anti-war victory to the Chiang bandits. According to this traitor's logic, if the thieves rob us and we do not resist, if the enemy kills us and we lower our heads, we will be bullied and butchered by anyone, and the eight years of anti-Japanese achievements will be in vain, and the people's army will be in danger of total annihilation. The "peaceful democratic new stage" was a grand deception and conspiracy jointly planned by Liu Shaoqi and Chiang Kai-shek to betray the country and the revolution.

Just as Liu Shaoqi was shouting that the "peaceful democratic" era had arrived, Chiang Kai-shek issued the "bandit suppression order." The so-called "bandit suppression" was to annihilate the Communist Party and the people's army and slaughter the people. Chiang Kai-shek was both talking and acting here. Take my hometown of Feixian, for example. After it was occupied by the enemy, it became a living hell. The Kuomintang bandits' butcher knives slaughtered our anti-Japanese people, and the enemy's whips lashed our class brothers. In a pit near Dongshahe in our county town, the Kuomintang bandits buried alive more than a thousand anti-war cadres and revolutionary masses, creating the "thousand-person pit incident," a crime against humanity. In the face of these bloody facts, where was the "peace"? Where was the "democracy"? There was none, not a bit! At that time, my eldest child was just two years old and was imprisoned by the Kuomintang for being a "relative of a resistance fighter," along with his mother. They endured beatings and torture. Reflecting on this historical fact, it arouses our deep hatred for the tyrant Chiang Kai-shek and equally hates the traitor Liu Shaoqi, who aided Chiang Kai-shek.

Liu Shaoqi, this traitor to the proletariat, a lackey of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, always jumps out at critical historical turning points, deceiving the people, suppressing the revolution, and serving his masters. He is a die-hard remnant of the Kuomintang, a proxy of Chiang Kai-shek hidden within the revolutionary ranks. Today, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people have dragged Liu Shaoqi out, knocked him down, eliminated this harm, and cleared away this big piece of "junk," which is truly heartening.

    刘少奇鼓吹“和平民主新阶段”为谁帮忙？
    解放军某部团长　王德魁
    罪恶累累的刘少奇，是国民党反动派的忠实走狗，是蒋介石的难兄难弟。几十年来，他身在革命队伍里，心紧贴着蒋介石，从“和平民主新阶段”的狂妄叫喊中，完全暴露了刘少奇这个大内奸背叛民族，背叛革命，充当美帝国主义、国民党反动派忠实走狗的丑恶嘴脸。
    八年抗日战争，蒋介石龟缩在峨眉山上，坐山观虎斗。一九四五年，抗日战争的炮火刚刚停止，蒋介石就大摇大摆地下了山，要摘“桃子”，要抢夺抗日战争胜利的果实。抗日战争是毛主席天才指挥的，胜利果实是中国人民流血牺牲换来的。蒋介石要抢，中国共产党和中国人民绝对不答应。贼心不死的蒋介石，一方面磨刀霍霍，准备发动消灭共产党和人民军队的全面内战；另一方面搞了一个和平骗局，妄想要我们上当。在他主子美帝国主义的怂恿下，蒋介石挂起“和平”黑旗，大演“和平”丑戏。毛主席一眼看穿了蒋介石的贼心，明确指出：“蒋介石对于人民是寸权必夺，寸利必得。我们呢？我们的方针是针锋相对，寸土必争。……现在蒋介石已经在磨刀了，因此，我们也要磨刀。”毛主席向全国人民下达了新的战斗动员令。然而，就在这个节骨眼上，埋藏在党内的蒋介石的乏走狗刘少奇跳了出来，抛出了“和平民主新阶段”的反动谬论，公开和毛主席唱对台戏。刘少奇打的什么主意？为谁卖力？让我们用铁的历史事实，揭开刘少奇大内奸的画皮，戳穿他鼓吹“和平民主新阶段”的恶毒用心。
    当刘少奇在为国民党反动派涂脂抹粉的时候，国民党反动派在干什么呢？毛主席一语道破了问题的要害：“国民党一方面同我们谈判，另一方面又在积极进攻解放区。”事实正是这样。当时，我们住在山东淄川，离国民党匪军驻区只有二里地。他们的一行一动，所作所为，我们都看得一清二楚。在蒋介石“和平”口号的掩护下，大批大批的国民党军队朝我们开来，一面侵占我们解放区，一面向我们进行军事挑衅。敌人在我们驻区周围安了层层岗哨，对我们实行封锁、围困。匪军哨兵个个刀出鞘，弹上膛，刀刃枪口直对我们。目睹敌人玩弄的这个“和平”花招，同志们个个义愤满胸。那有这样的强盗“和平”？从没见过这样的贼人“善心”！我们严格遵循毛主席“针锋相对”的教导，你派两个岗，我安四重哨；你用轻机枪，我架迫击炮。寸土必争，寸步不让。有一次，匪军兽性发作，无故枪杀了我们的哨兵。我们满怀复仇怒火，发动驻地群众，军民同开控诉大会，揭露蒋介石假和平、真内战的阴谋。事实深刻教育了广大群众，也教育了我们。眼前的敌人是狼，全国的蒋匪军都是一样。蒋介石的“和平”口号喊得越响，内战的炮声也越响。我们驻地附近的蒋匪军一天也没有停止过对我们的进攻，一时也没有放松同我们抢夺胜利果实。这充分证实了，“和平”是蒋介石内战的号角，“民主”是他屠杀人民的外衣。面临着两种命运决战的紧急关头，刘少奇和美帝国主义、蒋介石一唱一和，一呼一应，同唱“和平民主”的黑戏，到底心怀什么鬼胎？不言而喻，刘少奇想的就是蒋介石想的，说的就是蒋介石说的，做的就是蒋介石做的。他是要我们放下枪杆子，跪倒在美帝国主义、蒋介石面前，拱手把祖国的大好河山送给敌人，把抗战的胜利果实让给蒋贼。按照这个大内奸的逻辑，贼人抢劫我不防，敌人杀我我低头，任人欺侮，任人宰割，八年的抗日成果就要付之东流，人民军队就有全部覆灭的危险。“和平民主新阶段”就是刘少奇和蒋介石共同策划的葬送祖国、叛卖革命的大骗局、大阴谋。
    就在刘少奇高喊“和平民主”已经到来的时候，蒋介石下达了“剿匪令”。所谓“剿匪”，就是要消灭共产党和人民军队，屠杀人民。蒋介石在这里是又说又干的。就拿我家费县来说，被敌人占领后，变成了一座人间地狱。蒋匪军的屠刀，杀害了我们的抗日人民；敌人的皮鞭，抽打着我们的阶级兄弟。我们县城东沙河附近的一个坑里，就被蒋匪军活埋了一千多名抗战干部和革命群众，制造了惨绝人寰的“千人坑事件”。在血淋淋的事实面前，“和平”在哪里？“民主”又在哪里？没有，一点也没有！那时，我的大孩子才刚满两岁，被国民党扣上“抗属”的罪名，也跟着他母亲进了国民党的监狱。挨过毒打，受过酷刑。回顾这段历史事实，激起我们对独夫民贼蒋介石的刻骨仇恨，也同样恨透了蒋介石的帮凶刘少奇。
    刘少奇这个无产阶级的叛徒，帝国主义、国民党反动派的走狗，每当历史重大转折关头，他就公开跳出来，欺骗人民，镇压革命，为他的主子效劳出力。他是地地道道的国民党的残渣余孽，是埋在革命队伍里的蒋介石的代理人。今天，亿万革命人民把刘少奇揪了出来，打翻在地，除了这一害，清除了这块大“废料”，真是大快人心。
