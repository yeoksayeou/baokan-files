The red sun illuminates the border village of Kaba. The Tibetan serfs in Kaba Township, who have risen up, actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. They are deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism and self-criticism, and their consciousness has reached unprecedented heights. Everywhere, a new atmosphere prevails.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 12th: In the far southwestern mountains of our motherland—Jilong County in the Shigatse Region of Tibet—the Tibetan serfs who have risen up are, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, fanning the flames of revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. At present, in this remote village in the Himalayas, the great thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong have been widely propagated. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Tibet has been thoroughly criticized and exposed. The consciousness of the Tibetan serfs who have risen up has greatly improved, and a new atmosphere prevails everywhere.

When the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee reached this southwestern border village of our motherland, the Tibetan serfs in each village, holding portraits of Chairman Mao, blew victory horns and enthusiastically shouted, "The red sun of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the border village of Kaba! It illuminates the bright future of the Tibetan serfs who have risen up!" They resolutely declared, "Even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, the loyalty of the Tibetan serfs to Chairman Mao will never change!" The serfs enthusiastically hailed the decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever. The entire township of serfs who have risen up, with great revolutionary indignation, held more than twenty revolutionary criticism and self-criticism meetings, thoroughly exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Tibet, such as "stabilizing and developing individual economy" and "not dividing or struggling, not classifying classes in pastoral areas." They settled accounts with the crimes of this small group of class enemies who attempted to restore the feudal serf system. Many impoverished farmers and serfs who had deep grievances in the old society angrily said, "The traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and the reactionary feudal serf owners are of the same ilk. They stand on the same reactionary position, sit on the same cushion, eat from the same bowl of tsampa, and have the same goal—to turn the wheel of history backward, making us suffer twice. This is absolutely impossible." A young Tibetan woman of serf origin, Gyainzom, said, "Unless the waters of the Yarlung Zangbo River flow backward, even if the descendants of these class enemies wait until their hair turns white, their attempt to restore the old system is a futile dream!"

With the help of the border defense soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the Tibetan serfs in Kaba Township conducted extensive class education during the revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. They recounted their personal sufferings in the old society, their family histories, and village histories. Through remembrance and comparison, they deepened their hatred for the old society, their love for the new society, and their loyalty to Chairman Mao. An old woman from a poor serf family, Nyima Quba, wore the "eight-trigram robe" that had been passed down for two generations in the old society and went to various villages to denounce the crimes of the feudal serf system and criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary fallacies. She pointed to her ragged clothes and said to everyone, "This is Liu Shaoqi's 'exploitation is meritorious'!" Many serfs who had risen up used their own blood-stained history in the old society to educate the next generation, reminding them never to forget their roots and always follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize, and to definitely criticize Liu Shaoqi so that he can never rise again.

The revolutionary criticism and self-criticism greatly enhanced the Tibetan serfs' consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They placed the active learning and application of Chairman Mao Zedong Thought above everything else, greater than everything else, before everything else, and heavier than everything else. Every village in the township, even the homes of the serfs who had risen up, universally established Chairman Mao Zedong Thought study classes. A high tide of the mass movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought is surging forward in this mountain village. The "three loyalties" activity—loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line—is being carried out vigorously. The broad masses of serfs who have risen up sing "The East Is Red" every day, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life. Many can recite Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and more than a hundred quotations from Chairman Mao, and can sing several songs composed with Chairman Mao's quotations. In their daily speech and actions, everyone uses Chairman Mao's teachings to guide themselves and judge others. Some serfs who have risen up have been selected as active learners of Chairman Mao Zedong Thought in Jilong County. At present, the serfs who have risen up in the entire township are conducting more in-depth revolutionary criticism and self-criticism and more extensive mass movements to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. They have declared that they will study Chairman Mao's works for life and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

    红太阳照亮了祖国边村——卡邦
    卡邦乡藏族翻身农民活学活用毛泽东思想，深入开展革命大批判，觉悟空前提高，到处都是崭新气象
    据新华社拉萨十二日电　祖国最西南的山乡——西藏日喀则地区吉隆县卡邦乡的藏族翻身农民，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，正把革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。目前，在这个喜马拉雅山区的偏僻乡村里，伟大的毛泽东思想得到了空前大普及，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在西藏地区代理人的反革命修正主义路线已经被批得臭不可闻。藏族翻身农民的思想革命化有了很大提高，到处呈现着崭新的气象。
    党的八届十二中全会公报传到祖国这个西南边境的山乡时，各村的藏族翻身农民头顶着毛主席的画像，吹起胜利的号角，热烈欢呼：“毛泽东思想的红太阳照亮了祖国边村——卡邦！照亮了藏族翻身农民奋勇前进的光辉前程！”他们坚决表示：“海枯石烂，藏族翻身农民忠于毛主席的红心永不变！”翻身农民们热烈欢呼党的八届十二中全会决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党。全乡翻身农民怀着极大的革命义愤，一连开了二十多次革命大批判会，深揭狠批刘少奇及其在西藏的代理人推行的“稳定发展个体经济”、“牧区不分不斗，不划分阶级”等反革命修正主义黑货，清算这一小撮阶级敌人妄图复辟封建农奴制度的滔天罪行。许多在旧社会里苦大仇深的贫苦农民和翻身农奴愤怒地说，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和反动的封建农奴主是一路货色，他们站的是一个反动立场，坐的是一个卡垫，在一个碗里抓酥油?粑，为的是一个目的，就是要把历史的车轮拉向后转，使我们重受二遍苦，这一万个办不到。农奴出身的藏族女青年桂桑说：“除非是雅鲁藏布江的江水倒流，否则等这一小撮阶级敌人的徒孙的头发等白了，他们想复辟旧制度，也是痴心妄想！”
    在人民解放军边防战士的帮助下，卡邦乡的藏族翻身农民在革命大批判中，广泛开展了阶级教育。他们大谈个人在旧社会的苦难史，大谈家史、村史，通过回忆对比、忆苦思甜，进一步加深了对旧社会的仇恨、对新社会的热爱和对毛主席的忠诚。这个乡贫苦农奴出身的老大娘尼玛曲巴，带着她在旧社会里穿了两代人的“八卦衣”，到各村去控诉封建农奴制度的罪恶，批判刘少奇的反革命谬论。她逢人就指着她的破衣说：“这就是刘少奇的‘剥削有功’！”许多翻身农民用自己在旧社会的血泪史来教育下一代，要他们永不忘本，永远跟着毛主席干革命，一定要把刘少奇批得永世不得翻身。
    革命的大批判，大大提高了藏族翻身农民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。全乡各村甚至翻身农民的家庭里都普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，一个活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的高潮，在这个山乡里正一浪高过一浪地向前发展。无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动开展得轰轰烈烈。广大翻身农民每天高唱《东方红》，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆。许多人能背诵毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和上百条毛主席语录，会唱好几支用毛主席语录谱写的歌曲。平时说话办事，大家都用毛主席的教导来要求自己，衡量别人。有的翻身农民还被选为吉隆县活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。目前，全乡翻身农民正在更加深入地开展革命大批判，更广泛地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。他们表示，一定要学一辈子毛主席著作，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
