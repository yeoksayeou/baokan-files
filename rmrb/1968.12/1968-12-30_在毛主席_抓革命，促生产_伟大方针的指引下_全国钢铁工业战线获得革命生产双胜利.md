Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," the nationwide steel industry has achieved dual victories in revolution and production. Steel industry workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a wave of struggle, criticism, and reform with high revolutionary enthusiasm, promoting rapid development in production. This year, the daily production levels of steel and steel products have continuously increased, and the output of major products such as ore, pig iron, and metallurgical coke has seen significant growth.

New China News Agency, December 29th: Under the guidance of the great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" by our great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary workers of the steel industry across the country have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasped the revolution firmly, and promoted production vigorously. They have launched a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and reform, promoting rapid development in production. Since this year, the daily production levels of steel and steel products across the country have continuously increased, and the output of major products such as ore, pig iron, and metallurgical coke has also seen significant growth.

The largest steel and iron enterprise in our country, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, under the leadership of various levels of revolutionary committees, has turned the boundless enthusiasm ignited from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into productive power. Since March of this year, they have continuously created over 300 new production records, successfully developed over 700 new products, and significantly increased steel and iron production. The revolutionary workers of Shanghai's steel enterprises have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents' promotion of the "crawling philosophy," "expert management," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. They have broken through the old frameworks that restrained the workers' initiative and creativity. This year, the number of new products successfully developed, their level, and the speed of development are all unprecedented. Now, Shanghai's steel enterprises have overfulfilled this year's national plan, and many units' product output has exceeded the highest historical levels. Benxi Iron and Steel Company has also completed its main product production plans ahead of schedule this year and successfully developed many new products. Especially with the vigorous development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the production situation of this company has undergone daily and monthly changes. Many heavy physical labors have been replaced by mechanized and automated equipment, and many advanced technologies have been successively created. In addition, enterprises such as Handan Metallurgical Mine Company, Baotou Iron and Steel Company, Capital Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Maanshan Iron and Steel Company, and steel enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, Hubei, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, all have a very good situation in revolution and production. All of this vividly illustrates a truth: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country."

The new development of China's steel industry not only creates favorable conditions for the continued leapfrog development of the steel industry but also provides a solid material foundation for the new leap in national defense construction and the national economy.

Reviewing the more than two-year-long battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers deeply feel: Sailing the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The working class can only fully play its leading role by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in steel enterprises nationwide has reached a new high and achieved a new level. From the factory area to the workers' dormitories, from the side of the steel furnaces to the mining sites, everywhere has become a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary workers arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. They say: We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, stand by the blast furnace, with the world in our hearts, and bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. Whenever Chairman Mao issues new instructions, or the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin issues new battle orders, steel workers across the country act immediately and resolutely execute them. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call for "the working class must lead everything," steel enterprises across the country have sent batches of workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, entering various domains of the superstructure to lead the struggle, criticism, and reform. Workers who stay in the factory firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, making the revolution roar and production flourish.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture only a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." Revolutionary workers of the steel industry nationwide, in implementing the various battle tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, have launched a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, further carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and everywhere presented a hot and lively battle scene. The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "theory of the tamed tool," "expert management," "material incentives," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods have been criticized to the point of being unbearable. The study of the history of the struggle between the two lines has greatly raised the revolutionary workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promoting the deepening of struggle, criticism, and reform. Now, a large part of the unreasonable regulations and institutions in steel enterprises nationwide have been abolished, and the cumbersome management organizations have also been reformed and streamlined. The "Anshan Constitution" personally approved by Chairman Mao is being implemented in many enterprises.

With the deepening of struggle, criticism, and reform, a new high tide of mass technological innovation and technological revolution has emerged in China's steel industry. Revolutionary workers have taken hold of the power of production technology, combining the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do with scientific experimentation, climbing one technological peak after another that previous generations have not reached. Statistics show that since March of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has implemented over 400 major technological innovation projects.

This year, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has successfully experimented with 87 major new technologies, 11 of which have reached or exceeded the world's advanced level. For example, China's first electric furnace hydraulic automatic control device, the "East is Red" electric furnace steelmaking automatic control device, the first application of frequency-sensitive resistors on large main motors, and large electric-hydraulic track-type tamping machines are all advanced technologies that past bourgeois technical "authorities" dared not touch. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and successfully developed these devices one after another. Moreover, the performance of these devices far exceeds that of similar products from other countries.

The mining workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Yingtaoyuan Iron Mine have successfully experimented with the residual column electric power backfilling large-scale blasting method, which was previously considered a "forbidden zone" by bourgeois technical "authorities." Bourgeois technical "authorities" had proposed many rules and regulations, restraining the workers' hands and feet. Workers did not believe in that and, with the support and help of the revolutionary committee and the army, successfully blasted 160,000 tons of ore in one go, increasing the blasting volume by 300 times and creating the highest record of underground blasting in black metal mines. This year, the more than 1,000 types of high-strength low-alloy steel and steel products that have been successfully developed nationwide, which are urgently needed by the state and suitable for China's resource conditions, have opened up a new path for China to develop the steel industry quickly, efficiently, and economically.

Now, the revolutionary workers of the steel industry nationwide are, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, comprehensively implementing the various battle tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, determined to achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指引下
    全国钢铁工业战线获得革命生产双胜利
    钢铁战线革命职工用毛泽东思想武装自己，以高昂的战斗热情掀起了斗批改高潮，促进生产迅猛发展。今年，钢和钢材日产水平不断提高，矿石、生铁、冶金焦等主要产品的产量，有大幅度增长
    新华社二十九日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，我国钢铁工业战线广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起了波澜壮阔的斗、批、改高潮，促进了生产的迅猛发展。今年以来，全国钢和钢材的日产水平不断提高，矿石、生铁、冶金焦等主要产品的产量，也都有大幅度增长。
    我国最大的钢铁联合企业——鞍山钢铁公司，广大革命职工在各级革命委员会的领导下，把从无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上，从今年三月以来连续创造了三百多项生产新纪录，试制成功了七百多种新产品，钢铁产量也有显著增长。上海钢铁企业革命职工深入开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行的“爬行哲学”、“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货，打破束缚工人积极性和创造性的旧框框，今年试制成功的新产品品种之多，水平之高，速度之快，都是过去从没有过的。现在，上海钢铁企业已超额完成今年国家计划，许多单位的产品产量超过了历史最高年份。本溪钢铁公司今年主要产品也都提前完成生产计划，并试制成功了许多新产品。特别是随着技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，这个公司的生产面貌发生了日新月异的变化，一些笨重的体力劳动已经被机械化、自动化的设备所代替，许多尖端技术陆续创造出来。此外，象邯郸冶金矿山公司、包头钢铁公司、首都钢铁公司、武汉钢铁公司、马鞍山钢铁公司，以及北京、天津、湖北、辽宁、黑龙江等地的钢铁企业，革命和生产形势也都一片大好。所有这一切，雄辩地说明了一个真理：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”
    我国钢铁工业的新发展，不但为钢铁工业的继续跃进创造了有利条件，同时也为国防建设和国民经济的新飞跃提供了雄厚的物质基础。
    广大革命职工回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，深切体会到：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。工人阶级只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能充分发挥自己的领导作用。随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，全国钢铁企业活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮，达到了新水平。从厂区到职工宿舍，从炼钢炉旁到采矿场上，到处都成了活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，广大革命职工用毛泽东思想武装自己，精神面貌发生了深刻变化。他们说：我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，站在高炉旁，胸怀全世界，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担。每当毛主席发出最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出新的战斗号令，各地钢铁工人闻风而动，坚决执行。伟大领袖毛主席发出“工人阶级必须领导一切”的号召以后，各地钢铁企业派出大批工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，开进上层建筑各个领域领导斗、批、改，留厂工人狠抓革命，猛促生产，把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”全国钢铁工业战线革命职工在落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会所提出的各项战斗任务中，掀起了党内两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步开展了革命大批判，到处出现了热气腾腾的战斗场面。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”、“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，被广大革命职工批得臭不可闻。两条路线斗争史的学习，大大提高了革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。现在，全国钢铁企业中不合理的规章制度，很大一部分已经废除，庞杂的管理机构也进行了改革和精简，毛主席亲自批示的“鞍钢宪法”，在许多企业中贯彻实施。
    随着斗、批、改的深入发展，群众性技术革新和技术革命的新高潮已在我国钢铁工业战线上出现。广大革命职工掌握了生产技术大权，把敢想、敢干的革命精神和科学实验紧密结合起来，攀登了一个又一个前人没有攀登过的技术高峰。据统计，鞍山钢铁公司从今年三月以来，已经实现了四百多个重大的技术革新项目。
    本溪钢铁公司今年试验成功的八十七项重大新技术中，有十一项达到或超过了世界先进水平。其中如我国第一台电炉液压自动控制装置、“东方红”号电炉炼钢自动控制装置、大型主电机上第一次应用的频敏变阻器、大型电动液压轨道式捣固机等，都是过去资产阶级技术“权威”碰都不敢碰的尖端技术。在无产阶级文化大革命中，工人们用毛泽东思想武装自己，破除迷信，解放思想，把这些设备一个又一个地试制了出来，而且设备性能远远超过了世界各国的同类产品。
    鞍钢樱桃园铁矿采矿工人试验成功的残柱电力回采大爆破法，以前曾被资产阶级技术“权威”视为“禁区”。资产阶级技术“权威”曾提出许多条条框框，束缚工人手脚。工人们不相信那一套，在革委会和解放军的支持帮助下，终于一次就成功地爆破了十六万吨矿石，比通常爆破量提高了三百倍，创造了黑色金属矿山坑内爆破的最高纪录。今年各地试制成功的上千种国家急需而又适合我国资源条件的高强度低合金钢和钢材，为我国多快好省地发展钢铁工业开辟了一条崭新的道路。
    现在，我国钢铁工业战线上的广大革命职工，正以高昂的战斗热情，全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
