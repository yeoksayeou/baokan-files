Just as we are greatly inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, closely following the great leader Chairman Mao, and striving for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have received the exhilarating news: our country has successfully conducted a new hydrogen bomb test. The 1.2 million industrial workers in Shanghai are filled with immense excitement and warmly celebrate the success of this hydrogen bomb test!

From last June, when our country successfully detonated its first hydrogen bomb, to this new hydrogen bomb test, it has only been a little over a year. The development of our country's nuclear weapons has achieved such a new leap, fully demonstrating the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought, demonstrating the mighty power of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and fully proving that the achievements of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the greatest, ever greater. Let the domestic and foreign reactionaries who slander our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as "disrupting production" open their eyes and see the fact of our successful hydrogen bomb test! Without this cultural revolution, without exposing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents, without seizing back the power of science and technology from the bourgeoisie, and without thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, could our country's science and technology develop so rapidly? The facts speak loudly: it is only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought and kicking out the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his gang, criticizing and denouncing their counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, that we, the working class and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel, can truly show our mettle in the vast arena of socialism!

The success of this new hydrogen bomb test has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist clique. Whether the U.S. and Soviet revisionists collude to redraw the map of the world, or concoct some so-called "non-proliferation treaty," or plot some new deal to "limit and reduce strategic nuclear weapon systems," all their tricks and schemes will be thrown into the vast ocean and perish before the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! The Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world will resolutely advance along the revolutionary path according to their own will!

The success of our country's new hydrogen bomb test shows the tremendous power of the principle that "the working class must lead everything." We, the working class, have entered all domains of the superstructure, ending the history of bourgeois intellectuals monopolizing science and technology. The working class has become the master of science and technology, and can thus, following Chairman Mao's teachings, "We cannot follow the old path of technological development taken by other countries, crawling step by step behind others. We must break conventions and adopt advanced technology to the greatest extent possible, and in a not-too-long historical period, build our country into a socialist, modernized, and powerful nation." We will climb to the peak of world science and technology at the fastest speed.

Ultimately, the success of the new hydrogen bomb test is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao said, "When the people master Mao Zedong Thought, they become the wisest and bravest, and can unleash boundless power!" We, the working class, have mastered this incredibly powerful spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought, and can create powerful material hydrogen bombs, and can create even greater miracles. The success of the new hydrogen bomb test has greatly inspired us, the working class of Shanghai. We are determined, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, to raise high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and achieve the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various stages as proposed by Chairman Mao. We will grasp the revolution and promote production, and make new contributions to accelerating the modernization of our country's industry, agriculture, and national defense!

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    上海工人造反总司令部
    正当我们在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而奋勇前进的时候，传来了振奋人心的捷报：我国成功地进行了一次新的氢弹试验。上海一百二十万产业工人以无比激动的心情，热烈欢呼这次氢弹试验的成功！
    从去年六月我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功到这次新的氢弹试验，仅仅一年多的时间，我国核武器的发展，就实现了这样新的飞跃，充分显示了毛泽东思想的巨大威力，显示了我国无产阶级文化大革命的强大威力，充分证明了我国无产阶级文化大革命的成绩是最大最大最大，越来越大。国内外反动派污蔑我国无产阶级文化大革命“破坏了生产”，让他们睁开眼看看我国氢弹试验成功的事实吧！不搞这场文化大革命，不把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人揪出来，不把科学技术大权夺回到无产阶级手里，不彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，我国的科学技术，能如此迅猛地发展吗？事实雄辩地证明：我们工人阶级和革命的科技人员，只有掌握毛泽东思想，只有踢开叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙，批倒批臭他们的反革命修正主义黑货，才能真正在社会主义的广阔天地里大显身手！
    这次新的氢弹试验成功，给了以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者以沉重的打击。美帝、苏修互相勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界也罢，炮制什么所谓“防止核扩散条约”也罢，策划什么“限制和削减战略核武器系统”的新交易也罢，他们的一切阴谋诡计，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民面前，都将被抛入汪洋大海，统统完蛋！中国人民和全世界革命人民坚定地按照自己的意志，在革命的大路上阔步前进！
    我国新的氢弹的试验成功，显示了“工人阶级必须领导一切”的无比威力。我们工人阶级开进了上层建筑各个领域，结束了资产阶级知识分子垄断科学技术的历史。工人阶级成了科学技术的主人，就能够按照毛主席的教导：“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。”以最快的速度攀登世界科学技术的顶峰。
    新的氢弹的试验成功，归根到底，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。林彪副主席说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”我们工人阶级掌握了毛泽东思想这个威力无比的精神原子弹，就能创造出巨大威力的物质氢弹，就能够创造出更新更大的奇迹。新的氢弹的试验成功，给了我们上海工人阶级以巨大的鼓舞，我们决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，更高地举起马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到新的水平，胜利实现毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的伟大任务，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为加速我国的工业现代化、农业现代化、国防现代化作出新贡献！
