In the great tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have created countless miracles. Recently, news from the Liaodong Peninsula brought a heartening report: all 105 deaf-mute students at the Fuxian County Deaf-Mute School, after being treated by the Mao Zedong Thought Medical and Health Team of the People's Liberation Army's 3125 Unit, have all recovered their hearing and speaking abilities. They can shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" recite Chairman Mao's quotations, and many, after training, can sing "The East Is Red" and read the brilliant "Old Three Articles." This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is the triumphant march of Chairman Mao's proletarian health line!

With proletarian feelings, determined to overcome the difficulties in treating deaf-mutes

In June of this year, the 3125 Unit dispatched a medical team consisting of two military doctors, one pharmacist, and three medical personnel, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." They carried Mao Zedong's revolutionary books, shouldered their bags, and arrived at a deaf-mute school in Fuxian County, Fuzhou Commune, Liaoning Province.

Many of the deaf-mute patients in this school had been treated in large hospitals in the city, but none had been cured. The medical team was determined to overcome this difficulty. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "If you cannot solve a problem, then go and investigate the current situation and its history." Through home visits and family discussions, they conducted a comprehensive investigation into the causes of deaf-mutism.

The medical team visited the home of deaf-mute student Wang Zhongming. Wang's mother painfully recounted her mother's and son's tragic experiences of becoming deaf-mutes: "My mother followed the elders begging for food since she was young. In the harsh winter, she fell ill on the road, nearly dying without money for treatment, and ended up mute. The old society ruined my mother's life. After liberation, the evil Soucheng Liu, who relentlessly promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line, closed the hospital doors to us poor and lower-middle peasants. When Zhongming was four, he suddenly had a high fever. Because of the lack of medical care in the countryside, it dragged on for ten days. The fever subsided, but the child became deaf and mute. His father took him to a large hospital in Dalian, waiting for two whole days just to see a doctor. A so-called 'expert' saw that the child's ears had pus, avoided him from afar, and falsely said, 'The eardrum is damaged and cannot be treated.' With one sentence, he pushed the father and son out of the hospital."

The medical team compiled the investigation results: 98% of the deaf-mute patients came from poor peasant families; 95% lived in remote rural areas with poor medical care, leading to deaf-mutism due to untreated illnesses. This deeply exposed the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line. The living facts ignited the class anger in the hearts of the medical team members. With strong class feelings for their deaf-mute comrades, they threw themselves into the battle of treating deaf-mutism.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, exploring new paths in treating deaf-mutism

The medical team, facing the difficulties in treatment, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." They followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Once you grasp the principal contradiction, all problems will be solved." They first analyzed whether deafness or mutism was the principal contradiction. From their investigation, they found that most deaf-mute patients were deaf but could make "ah ah" sounds; most became deaf-mute at the age of two or three due to illness, generally becoming deaf before mute. They believed that, generally, deafness was the principal contradiction, and mutism was caused by deafness.

Next, they comprehensively analyzed the experiences and lessons of acupuncture treatment for deaf-mutism, exploring new paths in treating deaf-mutism. To find the acupuncture points for treating deafness, they practiced on themselves and each other, day and night. Each needle they inserted, they recorded the different depths, different manipulations, and different conduction directions of the acupuncture points, seeking patterns from them. Medical personnel Zhang Chengqun, due to inserting too many needles, was in so much pain that he could hardly open his mouth. He recited "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" while experimenting. Team leader Li Naimin, to understand the function of a new acupuncture point, inserted over fifty needles into a point on his own body. After repeated experiments, the entire team finally discovered two acupuncture points with significant effects on treating deafness, finding a new method for treating deaf-mutism. In less than twenty days, 80% of the deaf-mute students in the school had recovered their hearing and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"

One morning, Dr. Li Naimin led the students in the "Three Loyalties" activity. The female student Cui Shuxin, who had not yet been treated, cried desperately. She used sign language to tell Li Naimin, "I want to shout 'Long live Chairman Mao'!" Li Naimin, deeply moved, comforted her, "We will definitely cure your illness soon!" Li Naimin carefully reviewed Cui Shuxin's acupuncture records. He recalled Chairman Mao's teachings on moving from specific to general and from general to specific, realizing that he had not paid attention to Cui Shuxin's uniqueness in treatment. The next day, he added acupuncture points for treating gynecological diseases, targeting Cui Shuxin's condition. After three consecutive acupuncture sessions, she recovered her hearing. The medical team promptly summarized and applied this experience, adjusting the acupuncture points for different conditions, ages, and genders, achieving good results. In over two months, all the deaf-mute students in the school had recovered their hearing and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The deaf-mutes shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

After the deaf-mute students recovered their hearing, they had difficulty speaking and easily forgot what they learned. The medical team carefully analyzed and found that the deaf-mute students were like young children learning to speak. They did not understand when taught to speak, especially political language, making it even harder to comprehend. Therefore, they had to undergo arduous and meticulous language training. The medical team helped the school reform the old teaching system, dividing students into basic language training classes and Mao Zedong Thought study classes based on their language proficiency. They also, together with revolutionary teachers and students, summarized a set of basic language training methods, including breathing, pronunciation, and tongue exercises, and compiled teaching materials based on Chairman Mao's quotations, making the language training process a means of instilling Mao Zedong Thought in the students.

Chairman Mao said: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the masses of workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." The medical team led revolutionary teachers and students to actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements, learning and applying in the struggle. Medical personnel Guo Derui, to help student Sun Yuling deeply understand Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," went with Sun Yuling to the class struggle, launching a fierce attack on class enemies. Sun Yuling's class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness rapidly improved. She not only took the lead in speaking at every criticism meeting, writing twenty-five criticism articles, but also actively mobilized everyone to resolutely fight against class enemies, being elected by revolutionary teachers and students as the deputy director of the school's revolutionary committee.

The deaf-mute students, who had gained new life, deeply loved the great leader Chairman Mao. To let the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers see with their own eyes the miracles created by Mao Zedong Thought, they compiled twenty-six spoken and sung performances, performing over seventy times in factories, rural areas, and military units, with over ten million workers, peasants, and soldiers watching their performances, causing a strong reaction. Whenever the deaf-mute students sang "The East Is Red" and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" on stage, both on and off the stage, everyone enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    毛主席无产阶级卫生路线的胜利凯歌
    ——记人民解放军三一二五部队毛泽东思想医疗卫生工作队开创治疗聋哑病新路子的事迹
    在无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗、批、改高潮中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万工农兵群众，创造了无数人间奇迹。最近，从辽东半岛又传来了一个振奋人心的喜讯：复县聋哑学校全校的一百零五名聋哑学生，经过人民解放军三一二五部队毛泽东思想医疗卫生工作队的治疗，人人都恢复了听觉和说话的功能，能够高呼“毛主席万岁”，背诵毛主席语录，许多人经过训练，已经能够唱《东方红》，能朗读光辉的“老三篇”。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级卫生路线的胜利凯歌！
    满怀无产阶级感情，决心攻克治疗聋哑的难关
    今年六月，三一二五部队派出由两名军医，一名司药，三名卫生员组成的毛泽东思想医疗卫生工作队，遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导，怀揣毛主席的革命宝书，背着背包，来到辽宁省复县复州公社的一所聋哑学校。
    这所学校的不少聋哑病人到城市的大医院治疗过，没有一个治好的。医疗队的同志决心攻克这个难关。他们带着问题，学习了毛主席的“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧”的教导，通过家庭访问、家属座谈等方式，对聋哑病发生的原因进行了一次全面的调查。
    医疗队来到了聋哑学生王忠明家。王大娘沉痛地讲述了她母亲和她儿子成为聋哑的悲惨经历：俺娘从小跟着老人要饭，十冬腊月病在路上，死去活来没钱治，硬是拖成了哑巴。吃人的旧社会坑害了俺娘一辈子。解放后，坏透了心的刘少奇，拚命推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，医院大门不为俺贫下中农开。忠明四岁那年，突然发高烧，因为农村缺医少药，拖了十几天，烧退了，孩子聋了，话也不会说了。他爹领着孩子到大连一个大医院，整整等了两天才看上病。一个“名医”看到孩子耳朵有脓，嫌臭，躲得老远，瞎说什么：“耳鼓膜坏了，不能治了。”一句话，把他爷俩推出了医院。
    医疗队把调查的情况作了一个统计：聋哑病人出身贫下中农的占百分之九十八；家住偏僻农村，缺医少药，有病得不到及时治疗造成聋哑的占百分之九十五。这深刻地揭露了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的滔天罪行。活生生的事实，点燃了医疗队同志们心头的阶级怒火，他们怀着对聋哑兄弟强烈的阶级感情，投入了治疗聋哑病的战斗。
    在毛泽东思想的指引下，探索治疗聋哑病的新路子
    医疗队带着治疗中的问题，反复学习了毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》和《矛盾论》。他们遵照毛主席
  “捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了”的教导，首先分析了聋和哑到底哪个是主要矛盾？他们从调查中发现，聋哑病人绝大多数都是聋，但能发出“啊啊”的声音；绝大多数是在两三岁时，因病引起的聋哑，一般都是先聋后哑。他们认为，一般说来，聋是主要矛盾，哑是聋引起的。
    接着，他们综合分析了针灸治疗聋哑的经验教训，探索治疗聋哑的新路子。为了寻找治聋的穴位，他们在自己身上扎、互相扎，白天练、夜间练。每扎一针，都把穴位的不同针刺深度，不同捻动和不同传导方向，一一记载下来，从中摸索规律。卫生员张成群因为扎针太多，痛得连嘴也张不开了，他一边背诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一边试验。医疗队长李乃民为了弄清一个新穴位的作用，就在自己身上的一个穴位扎了五十多针。全队同志经过反复试验，终于发现了两个疗效显著的治聋穴位，找到了治疗聋哑的新办法。不到二十天，全校百分之八十的聋哑学生都恢复了听力，喊出了“毛主席万岁！”
    一天早晨，医生李乃民领着同学们开展“三忠于”活动。尚未治好的女同学崔淑琴，急得直哭。她用手语对李乃民说：“我要高呼毛主席万岁！”李乃民深受感动地安慰她：“我们一定很快把你的病治好！”李乃民仔细地翻看崔淑琴的针灸登记。他想起了毛主席关于由特殊到一般，由一般到特殊的教导，发现自己在治疗中没有注意崔淑琴的特殊性。第二天，他针对着崔淑琴有妇科病，增加了治疗妇科病的针刺穴位，连续针灸三次，就使她恢复了听力。医疗队及时总结和运用了这个经验，针对不同病情、不同年龄和性别，对不同的患者增加、减少或转换相应的针刺穴位，取得了良好效果。在两个多月的时间里，就使全校的聋哑学生恢复了听力，喊出了“毛主席万岁！”
    聋哑人高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    聋哑学生恢复听力后，学话发音不准，学了易忘。医疗队仔细分析研究，发现聋哑学生象刚学话的小孩，教他说话他不懂，特别是政治方面的语言，就更不容易理解。因此，必须进行艰苦细致的语言训练。医疗队就帮助学校改革了旧的教学制度，按学生语言程度，编为基本语言训练班和毛泽东思想学习班，并和革命师生一起，总结了一套运气、发音、舌体操等基本语言训练方法，编选了以毛主席语录为内容的教材，使语言训练的过程成为向学生们灌输毛泽东思想的过程。
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”医疗队带领革命师生积极投入三大革命运动的实践，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。卫生员国德瑞为了帮助学生孙玉玲深刻理解毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，和孙玉玲一起到阶级斗争风浪中去，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。孙玉玲的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高。她不仅每次批判会上都带头发言，写了二十五篇批判文章，还积极发动大家向阶级敌人作坚决斗争，被革命师生推选为学校的革委会副主任。
    获得了新生的聋哑学生，对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱。他们为了让广大工农兵群众亲眼看到用毛泽东思想创造的人间奇迹，编排了二十六个说唱节目，先后到工厂、农村、部队演出了七十多场，有十多万工农兵群众观看了他们的演出，引起了强烈反响。每当聋哑学生在舞台上高唱《东方红》，高呼“毛主席万岁”的时候，台上台下纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
