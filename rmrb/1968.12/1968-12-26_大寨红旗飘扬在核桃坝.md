The red flag of Dazhai is flying high over Hexianba. Before the Cultural Revolution, three thousand mu of paddy fields in Hexianba Brigade, Meitan County, Guizhou Province, were over 90% "ten years of harvest in nine years of drought" "heaven-reliant fields." After more than two years of the storm of the Cultural Revolution, the "heaven-reliant fields" have become "guaranteed fields" that are resistant to both drought and flooding. The transformation of Hexianba Brigade is the result of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hexianba studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, and insisting on following the Dazhai path.

	There is everything with Mao Zedong Thought

During the Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture" and "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture" deeply moved the hearts of the people in Hexianba Brigade. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hexianba followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, studying the heroic deeds of the Dazhai people in changing the face of nature again and again. Inspired by the spirit of Dazhai, they decided to build a dam and a waterwheel pump station in the Meijiang River at the foot of the mountain to irrigate the farmland on the slopes.

	Initially, it was calculated that building a dam and a waterwheel pump station in the big river would require three hundred thousand yuan just for materials. Hexianba Brigade has always been a poor brigade, and it was very difficult to come up with such a large sum of money. A handful of class enemies came out to mock and ridicule, saying, "I've never seen a chicken feather fly into the sky!" But the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hexianba Brigade said resolutely, "With Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything." To solve the funding problem, the Party branch organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "hard struggle" and "self-reliance." The more the community members studied, the more enlightened they became, and the more they understood. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "We cannot rely on the state with our eyes turned up; we must find our own ways to solve difficulties." Thus, they pooled their wisdom and relied on their own strength, finally solving the funding problem without asking the state for a single cent of subsidy.

	After starting the construction, the first process was to drain the river and clear the foundation. That day, it was bitterly cold, and the river water was icy. This was a severe test. The poor and lower-middle peasants understood deeply in the struggle: relying on heaven and earth is unreliable; only by fighting against heaven and earth is the way out. Seventeen young men, without hesitation, took off their cotton clothes, singing the "Determined to struggle, unafraid of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties to win victory" song, jumped into the river. They fought against the cold and the waves. Their skin turned red from the cold, and their hands and feet became numb, but they still insisted on fighting in the water. After the struggle, they completed the foundation-clearing task, removing the "roadblock" for completing the dam construction before the flood season.

	Perseverance leads to victory

Fighting against nature and transforming it is not only a production struggle but also a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads; it is not only about fighting against heaven and earth but also about fighting against class enemies.

The blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution, ignited by the great leader Chairman Mao, swept across the country. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants in Meitan County, holding high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party at the county, district, and commune levels. "The day the people are happy is the day the reactionaries are in trouble," and "all reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will make desperate struggles." The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party at the county and district levels felt that their end was near and were unwilling to accept their doom. They followed the black directives of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, using the banner of "concerning production" to sabotage production everywhere, attempting to achieve their goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, this remote place, Hexianba, became a frontline outpost of class struggle.

One day, a capitalist roader from the county came to Hexianba and asked harshly, "Where did you get the money to build water conservancy?" The brigade Party branch secretary, Comrade He Dianlun, said, "It came from the masses." The capitalist roader glared and said, "Stop immediately, or you will be severely dealt with." He Dianlun retorted, "You can punish me, but the masses want to do it, and I cannot stop them." The capitalist roader slinked away with his tail between his legs.

Another time, when the community members were installing water pipes, a capitalist roader from the district came to the construction site. That capitalist roader pointed at He Dianlun and said, "In the face of a severe drought, you do not organize the masses to fight against the drought but insist on installing water pipes. You are sabotaging production." He Dianlun countered, "Do you think we are installing water pipes to fight against the drought?" This question left the capitalist roader speechless, and he slinked away in disgrace.

Chairman Mao said, "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind; there is no room for compromise on the line issue." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hexianba, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fear neither heaven nor earth. They engaged in a series of head-on struggles with a handful of stubborn capitalist roaders. The handful of stubborn capitalist roaders tried to stop the project four times, but they all ended in shameful failure.

	Advancing bravely along the course charted by Chairman Mao

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "To struggle with heaven and to prevail is joy unending! To struggle with earth and to prevail is joy unending! To struggle with man and to prevail is joy unending!" During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hexianba, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture," took the heroic people of Dazhai as their example, fighting against heaven, earth, and man. After more than two years of heroic struggle, they finally built a waterwheel pump station with twelve sets of machinery, opened large and small canals totaling more than forty li, and irrigated over two thousand five hundred mu of fields, basically achieving full water conservancy in the brigade. From then on, the dream that the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hexianba had long cherished was realized. The days of "ten years of harvest in nine years of drought" were gone forever. This year, the total grain production of the brigade increased by about one fold compared to 1966 and by more than 20% compared to 1967. To support the socialist construction of the country and the world revolution, they also sold twenty-nine million jin of commercial grain to the state. Water has a source, and trees have roots. The community members said, "Without the Communist Party, we would not have stood up. Without Chairman Mao, we would not have today's Hexianba."

	"The iron gate to the pass is like iron, but now we step forward from the beginning to cross it." After achieving water conservancy, they used the power of the waterwheel pump to generate electricity, realizing electrification for lighting, mechanization for milling, grinding, and oil pressing. They are determined to strive for full mechanization and electrification. Currently, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hexianba are advancing bravely along the course charted by Chairman Mao, riding the wind and waves, striving for an even greater harvest next year.

### 大寨红旗飘扬在核桃坝

    大寨红旗飘扬在核桃坝
    贵州省湄潭县联合公社核桃坝大队，在无产阶级文化大革命以前，三千亩稻田百分之九十以上还是“十年九不收”的“望天田”。经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命风暴的洗礼，“望天田”变成了旱涝“保收田”。核桃坝大队的变化，是核桃坝贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持走大寨之路的结果。
        有了毛泽东思想就有了一切
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大领袖毛主席“农业学大寨”、“水利是农业的命脉”等光辉思想在核桃坝大队深入人心。核桃坝贫下中农遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一遍又一遍地学习大寨人改天换地的英雄事迹。在大寨精神鼓舞下，他们决定在山脚下的湄江河里拦河筑坝，建设水轮泵站，把河水引上山坡灌溉农田。
    初步一算，在大河里拦河筑坝建水轮泵站，光备料就需要资金三万元。核桃坝大队历来就是一个穷队，要拿出这样一大笔资金，困难是很大的。一小撮阶级敌人跑出来冷嘲热讽地说：“没有见过鸡毛能够飞上天！”可是，核桃坝大队的贫下中农却斩钉截铁地说：“有了毛泽东思想就有了一切。”为了解决资金问题，党支部组织大家反复学习毛主席关于“艰苦奋斗”、“自力更生”等教导。社员们越学脑子越开窍，越学心里越亮堂。贫下中农说：“我们不能眼睛向上依赖国家，要自己想办法解决困难。”于是群策群力，依靠自己的力量，终于解决了资金问题，没有伸手要国家补助一分钱。
    开工以后，第一道工序就是下河排水清基。这天，天寒地冻，河水刺骨，这是一场严峻的考验。贫下中农在斗争中深深懂得：靠天靠地靠不住，只有斗天斗地才是出路。十七个青年小伙子，毫不迟疑地脱下棉衣，高唱着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌，跳下了河。他们战严寒，斗恶浪，皮肤冻红了，手脚不听使唤了，仍然坚持在水里战斗着。经过搏斗，完成了清基任务，为在洪水期以前完成筑坝工程搬掉了“拦路虎”。
              坚持下去就是胜利
    战天斗地，改造自然，不仅是一场生产斗争，也是一场激烈的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争；不仅要与天斗，与地斗，还要与阶级敌人斗。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，席卷全国。湄潭县广大无产阶级革命派和贫下中农，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，向县、区、社党内一小撮走资派发起了猛烈的攻击。“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时”，“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”县、区党内一小撮走资派感到末日已到，不甘心于自己的灭亡，他们秉承刘少奇及其同伙的黑旨意，打着“关心生产”的招牌，到处破坏生产，妄图达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏毛主席革命路线的目的。因此，核桃坝这个偏僻的地方，便成了阶级斗争的一个前哨阵地。
    一天，县里的一个走资派来到核桃坝恶狠狠地问：“你们修水利的钱是从哪里来的？”大队党支部书记何殿伦同志说：“是群众中来的。”走资派瞪着眼睛说：“赶快下马，谁要再干，就要严肃处理。”何殿伦同志给他顶了回去：“你要处分我可以，群众要干，我不能叫他们下马。”走资派夹起尾巴走了。
    又一次，社员们正在安装水管，区里一个走资派来到工地。那个走资派手指到何殿伦同志的脸上说：“大旱当头，你不组织群众抗旱，偏要安水管。你这是破坏生产。”何殿伦同志反问他：“你说我们安水管是不是抗旱？”问得那个走资派哑口无言，灰溜溜地走了。
    毛主席说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”无限忠于毛主席革命路线的核桃坝贫下中农，天不怕，地不怕，他们同一小撮顽固不化的走资派进行了一次又一次的针锋相对的斗争。一小撮顽固不化的走资派接连四次逼着要工程下马，结果他们都遭到了可耻的失败。
      沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“与天奋斗，其乐无穷！与地奋斗，其乐无穷！与人奋斗，其乐无穷！”核桃坝贫下中农在无产阶级文化大革命中，遵照毛主席
  “农业学大寨”的伟大教导，以英雄的大寨人为榜样，与天斗，与地斗，与人斗，经过两年多的英勇奋战，终于建成了一座装机十二台的水轮泵站，开大小渠道长达四十多华里，灌田二千五百多亩，基本上实现了全大队水利化。从此，核桃坝贫下中农多年没有实现的理想实现了。那种“十年九不收”的日子，一去不复返了。今年全大队粮食总产比一九六六年增产一倍左右，比一九六七年增产百分之二十以上。为了支援国家的社会主义建设，支援世界革命，今年，他们还向国家交售了二十九万多斤商品粮。水有源，树有根，社员们说：“翻身不忘共产党，吃饭不忘毛主席。没有毛主席，我们核桃坝就没有今天。”
      “雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”水利化以后，他们又利用水轮泵的动力发电，实现了照明电气化，打米、磨面、榨油机械化。他们决心为实现全面机械化和电气化而奋斗。当前，核桃坝的贫下中农正在沿着毛主席指引的航向，乘风破浪，奋勇前进，为夺取明年的更大丰收而奋斗。
