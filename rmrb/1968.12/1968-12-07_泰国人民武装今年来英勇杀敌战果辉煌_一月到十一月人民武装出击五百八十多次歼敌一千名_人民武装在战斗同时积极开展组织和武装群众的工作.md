Thai people's armed forces, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, have frequently launched attacks against the U.S.-Thanom group this year, achieving glorious victories.

According to a recent broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, incomplete statistics show that from January to the end of November this year, the Thai people's armed forces engaged in over 580 battles nationwide against the reactionary military and police of the U.S.-Thanom group. They killed and wounded approximately 1,000 enemy personnel, seized a large amount of weapons, shot down or damaged 11 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or damaged numerous military vehicles.

The radio station recently reported that since November, the people's armed forces in northern Thailand have seized the opportunity to frequently launch attacks, continuously achieving new victories.

It reported that the brave people's armed forces in Nakhon Thayok County, Phetchabun Province, after destroying an enemy stronghold and annihilating more than ten reactionary military and police personnel in November, subsequently launched four more attacks on enemy strongholds and ambushed reactionary military and police. On December 4 alone, they ambushed the enemy twice, annihilating five enemy personnel.

Since November, the people's armed forces in Nan Province have attacked enemy strongholds six times, killing and wounding many enemy personnel.

On November 27, the people's armed forces in Loei Province ambushed an enemy vehicle, killing and wounding three enemy personnel, including a reactionary leader from the Thanom group responsible for managing the concentration camps in Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, and Loei. The enemy vehicle was also destroyed.

On December 2, the people's armed forces in Loei Province launched another attack, killing and wounding four enemy personnel.

The radio station said that while continuously attacking the enemy, the people's armed forces are also actively carrying out propaganda, mobilization, organization, and arming of the masses, as well as eliminating traitors and local reactionaries.

The radio station said that this year, the people's armed forces have sent armed propaganda teams into rural areas more than 80 times to conduct propaganda, significantly raising the political awareness of the peasant masses and encouraging them to join the people's armed forces.

The radio station said that the people's armed forces have also collaborated with local masses to execute 114 notorious spies and local reactionaries.

The radio station recently called on the Thai people to, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, resolutely continue the people's war, defeat the U.S.-Thanom group, and achieve ultimate victory.
