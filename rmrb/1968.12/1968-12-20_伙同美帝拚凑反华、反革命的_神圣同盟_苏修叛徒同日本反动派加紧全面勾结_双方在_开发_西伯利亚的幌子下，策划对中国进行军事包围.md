The Soviet revisionist traitors, in order to cobble together a counter-revolutionary anti-China alliance, are intensifying their comprehensive collusion with the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Japanese reactionary government of Sato. This is yet another blatant exposure of their traitorous nature.

Since this year, the political collusion between the Soviet revisionist traitors and the Japanese reactionaries has further intensified. Soviet revisionist party and government leaders such as Baibakov, Suslov, and Patolichev have successively visited Tokyo, conspiring with the U.S. imperialist lackey Sato Eisaku and others, talking about their "friendly neighborly relations." After the Soviet revisionists invaded Czechoslovakia, the Sato government immediately declared that it would not change its "Soviet-Japanese cooperation" policy. This statement by the Japanese reactionaries made the Soviet revisionist clique grateful. Kosygin hurriedly wrote to Sato Eisaku, saying: "Despite the unfortunate events in Eastern Europe, it can still be affirmed that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan remain unchanged, which makes me very happy." Immediately afterward, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko used the opportunity of attending the United Nations General Assembly this autumn to hold talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeo, humbly requesting that Japan propose a set of "specific initial measures leading to a treaty," scheming to push the political collusion between the Soviet Union and Japan to a much greater extent.

At the same time, the Soviet revisionist clique has accelerated its economic collusion with the Japanese reactionaries. Allowing Japanese monopolistic capital to "develop" Siberia is a typical example. The Soviet revisionists not only allow Japanese monopolistic capital to exploit Siberian timber but also allow it to develop natural gas and oil, coal, copper, iron ore, and other underground resources, as well as marine resources. They even allow Japanese aircraft to fly over Siberian airspace. It can be said that the Soviet revisionist traitors are fully opening Siberia's land, sea, and air to Japanese monopolistic capital, allowing them to plunder the Soviet people. Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Patolichev shamelessly told the Japanese financial tycoons that a geographically close industrial country to the Soviet Union—Japan—providing "cooperation" is "indispensable" for the development of the Soviet Far East region. The chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce, Nesterov, assured Japan: "For matters of great concern to the Japanese side, we are prepared to give full consideration in formulating the overall development plan of the Soviet Union." The Soviet revisionist traitors' betrayal of national sovereignty and the interests of the people not only indicates their attempt to rely on the economic power of Japanese monopolistic capital to accelerate the comprehensive restoration of capitalism but also indicates their attempt to deepen political collusion through so-called Soviet-Japanese "economic cooperation," colluding with the Japanese reactionaries to intensify the encirclement of China under the pretext of "developing" Siberia.

Collaborating with the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to militarily encircle China is an important part of the Soviet revisionist clique's counter-revolutionary strategy. As early as May 1964, Mikoyan had carried a letter from Khrushchev to the Japanese Prime Minister and flew to Tokyo, engaging in extensive activities. In the letter, Khrushchev not only remained silent about the Japan-U.S. "security treaty" aimed at China but also talked about how the Soviet government was "prepared to discuss any proposals from the Japanese side on strengthening peace and security in the Far East." Later, Gromyko explicitly stated that "actions that harm Japan's relations with Western powers (i.e., the United States) are not the actions that should be taken to promote Soviet-Japanese friendship." The actions of these Soviet leaders actually encouraged and supported the Japan-U.S. military alliance. After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they further colluded with the Japanese reactionaries. In the summer of 1967, Kosygin took the opportunity of Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeo's activities in the Soviet Union to propose to the Sato reactionary government to "cooperate" in the so-called "organization of a response to aggression." Under the instigation of the Soviet revisionist clique, the Japanese reactionaries gradually shifted their military deployment focus from Hokkaido, which is close to the Soviet Union, to Kyushu, which is close to China. The Soviet revisionist clique also made corresponding military adjustments. While intensifying its invasion and threats against Eastern Europe, the Soviet revisionists further strengthened their armed provocations against China. They coordinated with the U.S. imperialists to build an anti-China encirclement, deploying a large number of troops along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders, and frequently sending aircraft to violate Chinese airspace, continuously creating border tensions.

The Soviet revisionist traitors colluding with the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to encircle socialist China will meet a miserable end. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are invincible. The Soviet revisionist clique and the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' frenzied anti-communism, anti-China, and anti-people actions will only awaken the Japanese people, the Soviet people, and the people of various countries oppressed by imperialism and revisionism, to join forces with the Chinese people to form a broad anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist united front, to carry the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle to the end, and to thoroughly bury the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the reactionary governments of various countries that follow them.

As pointed out in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "No matter what kind of garbage the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists cobble together to form an anti-China, counter-revolutionary 'Holy Alliance,' it will only be 'lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet.'"

    伙同美帝拚凑反华、反革命的“神圣同盟”
    苏修叛徒同日本反动派加紧全面勾结
    双方在“开发”西伯利亚的幌子下，策划对中国进行军事包围
    据新华社讯　苏修叛徒集团为了拚凑反革命的反华同盟，正在加紧同美帝的走狗日本佐藤反动政府进行全面勾结。这是它的叛徒嘴脸的再一次大暴露。
    今年以来，苏修叛徒集团同日本反动派的政治勾结，有了进一步的加强。苏修的党政头目巴伊巴科夫、苏斯洛夫、帕托利切夫等，相继走访东京，同美帝走狗佐藤荣作等人进行反革命串连，大谈其“睦邻友好”关系。苏修出兵入侵捷克斯洛伐克以后，佐藤政府随即声称不改变“日苏合作”政策。日本反动派的这一表态，使苏修集团感恩不尽。柯西金赶忙致函佐藤荣作说：“尽管在东欧发生了不幸的事件，但仍然可以肯定苏日之间的友好关系不变，这使我很高兴。”紧接着，苏联外长葛罗米柯利用出席今秋联合国会议的机会同日本外相三木武夫举行会谈，奴颜婢膝地请求日本提出一整套“导致一项和约的初步措施的具体建议”，阴谋把苏日间的政治勾结大大推进一步。
    同时，苏修集团还加速了同日本反动派的经济勾结。苏修让日本垄断资本“开发”西伯利亚是个典型事例。苏修不仅让日本垄断资本开采西伯利亚的木材，还让它在那里开发天然气和石油、煤炭、铜矿、铁矿等地下资源以及水产资源，甚至允许日本的飞机横越西伯利亚上空。可以说，苏修叛徒集团正在把西伯利亚的海陆空向日本垄断资本全面开放，让他们放肆地剥削苏联人民。苏修外贸部长帕托利切夫恬不知耻地对日本财阀说，在地理上与苏联相近的一个工业国——日本向苏联提供“合作”，对于开发苏联的远东地区是“不可缺少的”。苏修商会主席涅斯捷罗夫向日本保证：“对于日本方面非常关心的东西，我们准备在制订苏联整个开发计划的时候予以充分的考虑”。苏修叛徒集团如此出卖国家主权和人民利益，除了表明它企图依靠日本垄断资本的经济力量，来加紧全面复辟资本主义外，还表明，它企图通过所谓的苏日“经济合作”来加深政治勾结，伙同日本反动派在“开发”西伯利亚的幌子下，加紧进行对中国的包围。
    同美日反动派联合起来从军事上包围中国，是苏修集团的反革命战略的重要组成部分。早在一九六四年五月，米高扬就曾带着赫鲁晓夫给日本首相的信件飞往东京，大肆活动。赫鲁晓夫在信中不仅对矛头指向中国的日美“安全条约”一声不哼，而且大谈什么苏联政府“准备就加强远东地区的和平和保障安全问题讨论日本方面的任何提案”。后来，葛罗米柯又明确表示，“损害日本同西方大国（即美国）的关系的作法，不是增进苏日友好所应采取的作法”。苏修头目的这些言行，实际上是对日美军事同盟的纵容和鼓励。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台后，进一步同日本反动派狼狈为奸。一九六七年夏，柯西金乘日本外相三木武夫到苏联活动的时候，主动提出了要同佐藤反动政府在所谓“组织对侵略的回击”方面“进行合作”。在苏修集团的怂恿下，日本反动派把它的兵力配备重点逐渐从接近苏联的北海道移到接近中国的九州。苏修集团也作了相应的军事调动。苏修在加紧对东欧进行侵略威胁的同时，进一步加强了对中国的武装挑衅。它配合美帝大搞反华包围圈，在中苏和中蒙边境大量驻扎军队，并且加紧派遣飞机侵犯中国领空，不断制造边境紧张局势。
    苏修叛徒集团勾结美日反动派包围社会主义中国，是绝对没有好下场的。经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可战胜的。苏修集团和美日反动派疯狂地反共、反华、反人民，必将促使日本人民、苏联人民以及被帝修反压迫的各国人民进一步觉悟起来，同中国人民一道结成广泛的反帝反修统一战线，把反帝反修斗争进行到底，彻底埋葬美帝、苏修和紧随它们的各国反动派。
    正如中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报所指出：“不管美帝、苏修拚凑一些什么垃圾，组织反华、反革命的‘神圣同盟’，都只能是‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。”
