Inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary workers of Qingdao Vehicle Factory have been vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously advancing production. Since November, the average daily production level has increased by 42.6% compared to the third quarter, setting a new historical high for the factory. Product quality has also significantly improved.

Throughout this year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and under the specific leadership of the newly established revolutionary committee, the factory's revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination" have continuously developed and consolidated. The revolutionary criticism has been carried out vigorously. The workers have fiercely criticized the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, exposed his agents within the factory, smashed the revisionist management system, and launched a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The revolution has driven the leapfrog development of production. The factory's average daily output value in the second quarter increased by 68.4% compared to the first quarter, and in the third quarter, it increased by 55.4% compared to the second quarter.

    青岛车辆厂十一月份生产创最高水平
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，青岛车辆厂革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，十一月份以来，平均日产水平比第三季度提高百分之四十二点六，创造了这个厂历史上的最高水平。产品质量也有很大提高。
    今年以来，在毛主席的一系列最新指示的指引下，在新生的革命委员会的具体领导下，这个厂的革命大联合和革命“三结合”不断发展、巩固，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈。职工们狠批了党内最大的走资派刘少奇，揪出了刘少奇在厂内的代理人，摧毁了修正主义企业管理制度，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。革命推动了生产的飞跃发展。全厂第二季度平均日产值水平比第一季度提高百分之六十八点四，第三季度又比第二季度提高百分之五十五点四。
