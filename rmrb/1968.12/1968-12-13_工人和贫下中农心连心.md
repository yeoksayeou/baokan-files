After reading the report on the cooperative medical system implemented in Leyuan Commune, Changyang County, Hubei Province, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep all night.

I am the daughter of a hired laborer. Before liberation, my father was forced to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord, enduring endless exploitation and oppression. My sister and brother, due to illness and lack of money for treatment, had their young lives taken away by the evil old society. In that dark old society, how many families suffered similar fates?!

A thunderous roar shook the heavens. In 1949, the laboring masses across the country all gained liberation and emancipation. "The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, and Chairman Mao is closer than parents." Chairman Mao cares the most about the sufferings of the working people. In 1958, Yujing County in Jiangxi Province eradicated schistosomiasis, eliminating a major harm for the poor and lower-middle peasants. When Chairman Mao heard this news, he was so happy that he couldn't sleep, and joyfully wrote the brilliant poem "Farewell to the Plague Deities."

In the more than ten years since liberation, Chairman Mao has given many important instructions on health work. However, the old bureaucratic health department refused to carry them out. Instead, it faithfully implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist health line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi.

In the vast rural areas, especially in remote villages, there is a shortage of doctors and medicine. The poor and lower-middle peasants often face the threat of diseases, and some even lose their labor power or precious lives. This is entirely the result of Liu Shaoqi's frenzied implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the health sector. These accounts must be settled with the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi!

The implementation of the cooperative medical system in rural areas truly carries out Chairman Mao's great instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," solving the big problem of medical treatment and medicine for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. This is truly wonderful, excellent!

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are our class brothers and the most reliable allies of the working class. Workers and peasants have close hearts. The cooperative medical system, which is deeply welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, is also deeply welcomed by us workers. We workers firmly support and firmly endorse the universal implementation of the cooperative medical system in rural areas!

    工人和贫下中农心连心
    看了湖北省长阳县乐园公社实行合作医疗制度的报道，我激动得一夜未睡好觉。
    我是一个雇农的女儿。解放前，我父亲被迫给地主长年累月地做长工，受尽了地主的剥削和压迫。我的姐姐和哥哥，由于生病后无钱治疗，小小的生命就被万恶的旧社会吞没了。在那黑暗的旧社会里，类似这样的情况又何止一家？！
    霹雳一声震天响。一九四九年，全国的劳苦大众都得到了翻身和解放。“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”毛主席他老人家对劳动人民的疾苦最关心。一九五八年，江西省余江县消灭了血吸虫病，为贫下中农除了一大害。毛主席知道了这个消息，高兴得夜不能寐，欣然命笔，写下了光辉的诗篇《送瘟神》。
    解放后十几年来，毛主席对卫生工作作了许多重要指示。但是过去的老爷卫生部拒不执行，相反却忠实地执行了大叛徒刘少奇一整套的反革命修正主义卫生路线。
    广阔的农村，尤其是偏僻的乡村，缺医少药，贫下中农有病得不到及时的治疗。他们经常受疾病的威胁，有的甚至被夺去劳动力或宝贵的生命。这完全是刘少奇疯狂地在卫生战线上推行反革命修正主义路线所造成的。这些账要算在大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的身上！
    农村实行合作医疗制度，真正落实了毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，解决了广大贫下中农看病吃药的大问题，实在是太好了，好极了！
    广大的贫下中农是我们的阶级兄弟，是我们工人阶级最可靠的同盟者。工人农民心连心。深受贫下中农欢迎的合作医疗制度，也深受我们工人欢迎。我们工人坚决拥护、坚决支持在农村普遍实行合作医疗制度！
