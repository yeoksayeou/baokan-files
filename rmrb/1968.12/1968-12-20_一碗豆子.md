One evening, at the home of Yu Shujin, a poor peasant from the Tiger Mountain Production Brigade in the Tiger Mountain Commune of Kuandian County, the family's Mao Zedong Thought study class began its usual study session. After the family had studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and recited "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Yu Shujin brought out a bowl of beans and placed it in front of everyone.

Next, they had their "evening report." When it was Yu Shujin's younger son Anping's turn to report, he said, "Today, while working in the fields, I saw some bean grains on the ground and picked them up, putting them in my pocket. I brought them back, and that's this bowl of beans." As soon as Anping finished speaking, his older sister chimed in, "Everything we do must be for the public, for the people. That's how we show our loyalty to Chairman Mao. You picked up beans and brought them home; that's falling for the poison of the traitor Liu Shaoqi."

Anping, hearing this, puffed up and said, "How is that falling for Liu Shaoqi's poison?"

Yu Shujin then said, "Anping, you always say you love Chairman Mao the most and hate the traitor Liu Shaoqi the most. Chairman Mao teaches us to be 'selfless' and to 'serve the people wholeheartedly.' That traitor Liu Shaoqi keeps shouting, 'Personal interests must be taken care of; without personal interests, there can be no collective interests.' You should have turned in the beans to the brigade. That's following Chairman Mao's words and being selfless. Bringing the beans home is letting the 'self' take over, falling for Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of merging public and private interests.'"

Yu Shujin then recounted the family history to Anping. She said, "In the old society, where people were exploited, our ancestors had to work for the landlords. Your grandfather was beaten to death by the landlord, and your great-grandfather was also driven to death by the landlord. When I was your age, I was still begging for food with a begging stick. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us to stand up and walk the bright path of socialism. But that dog Liu Shaoqi wants to hook us with his 'self' and lead us down his 'revisionist' path to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. We must break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Don't fall for the traitor Liu Shaoqi's tricks!"

Yu Shujin's words ignited the family's class anger. Immediately, the family's Mao Zedong Thought study class turned into a battleground for criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi. Little Anping clenched his fists and shouted, "Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi! Defend Chairman Mao to the death!" As soon as the study class ended, Anping took the beans and handed them over to the production brigade.

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    一碗豆子
    一天晚上，宽甸县虎山公社虎山大队贫农社员于淑珍家，跟往常一样，家庭毛泽东思想学习班开始学习了。全家学习完毛主席的最新指示，背诵了《为人民服务》后，于淑珍大娘拿来一碗豆子，放在大家面前。
    接着，进行“晚汇报”，轮到于大娘的小儿子安平汇报时，他说：“今天在队里割包米，我看到在地头上掉了些豆粒，就顺手拣起来装在兜里，拿回来了，就是这碗豆子。”安平的话音刚落，他二姐就发言说：我们所做的每一件事都要为公，为人民，这才是忠于毛主席，你拣豆粒拿回家，就是中了大叛徒刘少奇的毒。”安平一听，气鼓鼓地说：“这怎么是中了刘少奇的毒呢？”
    于淑珍大娘接着说：“安平呀！你不是整天说最热爱毛主席，最恨大叛徒刘少奇吗？毛主席教导咱们要‘大公无私’，‘全心全意地为人民服务’，刘少奇这个大坏蛋，拚命地叫喊什么：‘个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益就没有整体利益’。你拣了豆粒应该交到队里，这才是听毛主席的话，一心为‘公’。把豆粒拿回家，就是‘私’字作怪，就是中了刘少奇‘公私溶化论’的毒。”接着，于大娘又对安平讲起了家史。她说：“在吃人的旧社会，咱家祖祖辈辈被迫给地主扛活，你大爷被地主活活地打死了，你爷爷也是被地主给逼死的，我象你这么大的时候，还正拿着要饭棍到处要饭吃呢。解放了，毛主席领导咱翻了身，走上了社会主义光明大道。可是，刘少奇这狗东西，还想叫咱上他的‘私’字钩，走他的‘修’字路，达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，咱一定得破私立公，可别上大叛徒刘少奇的当啊！”
    于大娘的话，燃起了全家的阶级怒火。立时，家庭毛泽东思想学习班变成了批判大叛徒刘少奇的战场，小安平紧握拳头高喊：“打倒大叛徒刘少奇！誓死保卫毛主席！”学习班刚一结束，安平就把豆粒送交到生产队里。　　　宽革武
