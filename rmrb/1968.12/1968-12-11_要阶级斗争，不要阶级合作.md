The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan: Chiang Kai-shek is going to launch a civil war. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, advocated a "peaceful democratic new stage." He did not mention Chiang Kai-shek's plot to launch a civil war but instead shouted loudly for the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek, claiming that the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would democratize China, which is an unprecedented domestic condition. According to him, Chiang Kai-shek, this butcher of the people, could also lay down his butcher's knife and talk about democracy with the Chinese people. Nonsense! This is a monstrous lie!

Did Chiang Kai-shek really lay down his butcher's knife? Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is the Kuomintang like? Look at its past, and you can know its present; look at its past and present, and you can know its future." Who instigated the ten-year counterrevolutionary civil war and pushed the Chinese people into the abyss of war? Who, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, passively resisted Japan and actively opposed the Communists, launching three major waves of anti-Communist campaigns? It was none other than the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek! At the time when the great traitor Liu Shaoqi was advocating cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of American imperialism, was launching a full-scale civil war while spreading the smoke screen of peace talks. Chiang Kai-shek, this bloodthirsty man, will never lay down his butcher's knife and cooperate with the Communist Party.

The Kuomintang's anti-Communist stance will not change. The Communist Party's policy of leading the broad masses of the people to overthrow the rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries will not change either. This is a life-and-death class struggle. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi's talk of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is merely a cover for the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek to massacre the people, acting as Chiang Kai-shek's faithful running dog.

The great traitor Liu Shaoqi also advocated that the working people and the big bourgeoisie should cooperate to ensure the democratization of China. He said: "The three main classes of the Chinese people want democracy: the working people, the middle bourgeoisie, and part of the big bourgeoisie demand democracy in China."

Under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek in semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, the big landlords and big bourgeoisie were the mortal enemies of the working people and the targets of the revolution. The relationship between the working people and the big bourgeoisie is one of life and death in class struggle, and it is absolutely impossible to cooperate with the big bourgeoisie to talk about democracy. The proletariat can only follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, take up arms, wage a violent revolution, and overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek to establish proletarian dictatorship, thus achieving true democracy.

The essence of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought is class, class contradictions, and class struggle, to make revolution, and to establish proletarian dictatorship. The reactionary fallacy of class cooperation advocated by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi is a public surrender to Chiang Kai-shek, a betrayal of the proletariat, and a sellout of the revolution.

    要阶级斗争，不要阶级合作
    解放军某部侦察连指导员  王修治
    伟大领袖毛主席在抗日战争胜利后指出：蒋介石要发动内战。大叛徒刘少奇却鼓吹“和平民主新阶段”。他闭口不谈蒋介石发动内战的阴谋，反而声嘶力竭地为国民党蒋介石帮腔，鼓吹阶级合作。他胡说什么：“国民党，共产党……的合作使中国民主化，这是从未有的国内条件。”按他的说法，蒋介石这个屠杀人民的刽子手也能放下屠刀，同中国人民讲民主了。呸！这是弥天大谎！
    蒋介石是真的放下屠刀了吗？毛主席教导我们：“国民党怎么样？看它的过去，就可以知道它的现在；看它的过去和现在，就可以知道它的将来。”是谁挑起十年反革命内战，把中国人民推进火海的？抗日战争中，消极抗日，积极反共，掀起三次大规模反共高潮的又是谁？不是别人，就是国民党蒋介石！在大叛徒刘少奇鼓吹国民党、共产党“合作”的时候，蒋介石一边施放和平谈判烟幕，一边在美帝国主义支持下，发动全面内战。蒋介石这个杀人成性的家伙，决不会放下屠刀和共产党合作。
    国民党蒋介石反共剿共的主张是变不了的。共产党要领导广大人民推翻美帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治的方针也是不会改变的。这是你死我活的阶级斗争。大叛徒刘少奇胡说国民党、共产党要合作，只不过是为国民党蒋介石大肆屠杀人民打掩护，充当蒋介石的忠实走狗。
    大叛徒刘少奇还鼓吹劳动人民和大资产阶级合作起来，去保证中国民主化。他胡说：“中国人民三个主要阶级要民主，劳动人民，中等资产阶级中间派，一部分大资产阶级，要求中国民主”。
    在蒋介石统治下的半封建半殖民地的旧中国，大地主大资产阶级是劳动人民的死敌，是革命的对象。劳动人民同大资产阶级之间的关系是你死我活的阶级斗争，根本不可能同大资产阶级合作起来讲民主的。无产阶级只有跟着共产党和毛主席，拿起枪杆子，进行暴力革命，大造帝国主义和国民党蒋介石的反，建立无产阶级专政，才能有真正的民主。
    马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的灵魂，就是阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争，闹革命，建立无产阶级专政。大叛徒刘少奇所鼓吹的阶级合作的反动谬论，就是公开投降蒋介石，背叛无产阶级，出卖革命。
