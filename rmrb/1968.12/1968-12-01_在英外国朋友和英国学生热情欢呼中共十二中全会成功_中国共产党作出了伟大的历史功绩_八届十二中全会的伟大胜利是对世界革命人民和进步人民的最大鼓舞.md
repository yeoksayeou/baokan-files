In the cheers of foreign friends and British students, the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has successfully concluded. The CPC has made great historical achievements. The great victory of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is the greatest encouragement to the revolutionary and progressive people of the world.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, LONDON, November 28 - Foreign friends and progressive student organizations in Britain have issued statements or made speeches, enthusiastically praising the successful conclusion of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Enlarged Twelfth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and warmly celebrating the great and decisive victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The Deputy Representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union in London, Gamanya, stated in a statement that the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Enlarged Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China shows that the Communist Party of China has made great historical achievements.

	He said: No matter when the revisionists show their heads, the Communist Party of China can always expose them and take decisive and swift actions against them. This is a very revolutionary action. The revolutionary people of the whole world should learn from the great example set by the Communist Party of China and its leader, Chairman Mao Zedong.

	Gamanya said: The counter-revolutionary, revisionist, and imperialist forces will never sleep. They are active day and night, trying to obstruct the wheels of revolution and progress. Therefore, we must always be vigilant against them.

	A British progressive student organization stated in a statement: The Twelfth Plenary Session of the Enlarged Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, presided over by Chairman Mao Zedong, is a great event of historical significance for the Chinese workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and for the revolutionary cause of socialism and communism in the world. The meeting marks the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on all fronts against the capitalist roaders represented by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, which is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

	The statement condemned the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi had been promoting for many years.

	The statement continued: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the greatest encouragement to British revolutionary students. "It encourages and teaches us to use the correct methods guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to fight against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and domestic reactionaries."

	The statement said: The struggle of students must be combined with the struggle of workers to establish a workers' government and proletarian dictatorship; one must learn from Mao Zedong Thought and put it into practice; one must struggle against the influences of opportunists, Trotskyites, revisionists, and other reactionaries in the student movement.

	A group of Irish people jointly issued a statement, pointing out that the great victory of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Enlarged Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China "is a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership group, and it is also the greatest encouragement to the revolutionary and progressive people of the world."

	A Greek friend residing in London said: The Chinese people, following the instructions of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, used it as a weapon to dig out Liu Shaoqi and all his accomplices from their lairs, thereby consolidating the proletarian dictatorship.

	He said: "The revolutionary and progressive people of the whole world congratulate the Chinese people on the victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, celebrate the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Enlarged Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and pay tribute to the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao!" This Greek friend wishes Chairman Mao eternal life!

    中国共产党作出了伟大的历史功绩
    八届十二中全会的伟大胜利是对世界革命人民和进步人民的最大鼓舞
    新华社伦敦二十八日电　在英国的外国朋友和英国进步学生团体，先后发表声明或谈话，热情赞扬中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会圆满成功，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大的、决定性的胜利。
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻伦敦副代表加曼雅在声明中指出，中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会表明，中国共产党作出了伟大的历史功绩。
    他说：修正主义者不论在什么时候露出头来，中国共产党总是能够识破他们，坚决地、迅速地对他们采取行动。这是十分革命的行动。全世界革命人民应当学习中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席所树立的伟大榜样。
    加曼雅说：反革命、修正主义和帝国主义势力决不会睡大觉。它们日夜活动，企图阻挡革命和进步的车轮。因此，必须对它们永远保持警惕。
    一个英国进步学生团体在声明中指出：由毛泽东主席主持的中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会，对中国工人、贫下中农，对全世界争取社会主义和共产主义的革命事业，是一件具有伟大历史意义的事情。会议标志着无产阶级文化大革命在一切战线上对以中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇为代表的资产阶级修正主义路线的决定性胜利，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    声明谴责了刘少奇多年来推行的反革命修正主义路线。
    声明接着说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是对英国革命学生的最大鼓舞。“它鼓舞和教导我们要用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导下的正确方法进行反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和国内反动派的斗争。”
    声明说，必须把学生的斗争同工人为建立工人政权和无产阶级专政而进行的斗争结合起来；必须学习毛泽东思想并把毛泽东思想付诸实践；必须同学生运动中的机会主义者、托洛茨基分子、修正主义分子和其他反动分子的影响作斗争。
    一批爱尔兰人联合发表声明，指出中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的伟大胜利“是对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的沉重打击，也是对全世界革命人民和进步人民的最大鼓舞”。
    旅居伦敦的一位希腊朋友说，中国人民遵照毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报的指示，用它作为武器，把刘少奇及其一切帮凶从巢穴中挖了出来，从而巩固了无产阶级专政。
    他说：“全世界革命人民和进步人民祝贺中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的胜利，欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，向伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席致敬！”这位希腊朋友祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
