Part of the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau Guang'anmen Station District studied the report of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China while studying the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. Through the study, everyone felt from the bottom of their hearts that Chairman Mao stood the highest and saw the farthest. As early as the eve of the nation's victory, Chairman Mao deeply analyzed the classes, class contradictions, and class struggles after the nation's victory, and wisely proposed the program and line for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, pointing out the direction for us to continue advancing. Studying Chairman Mao's report, recalling the facts of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines over the past nineteen years, the more we study, the more we feel Chairman Mao's words are extremely intimate, and the more we study, the more we feel our hearts are particularly bright.

Only the working class can lead the revolution

Liu Jinglu, the instructor of the Second Loading and Unloading Team and an old worker, said:

Whether or not to rely on the working class leadership, whether or not to rely on the working class, is a fundamental issue concerning what kind of country we should build after the nation's victory and what path we should take. Around this issue, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by Liu Shaoqi have been in fierce struggle.

Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of our working class. He has always represented the interests of the working class, supported the working class, and spoken for the working class. He values us, the working class, the most. In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao pointed out wisely: "The proletariat and its party, because of the oppression of several enemies, have been tempered and have the qualifications to lead the Chinese people's revolution. Whoever overlooks or belittles this will commit the error of right opportunism."

Before liberation, China was a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. The Chinese people had three mountains on their heads, and we, the working class, were at the bottom. In those days, our worker families had no grain to eat the next day, no complete clothes to wear, empty hands, and nothing to our name, and we faced the danger of unemployment at any time. I started working in Tianjin's Sixth Gate for the capitalists as a "laborer" when I was over ten years old and suffered greatly in the old society. Capitalists often said, "It's hard to find a three-legged toad, but there are plenty of two-legged people." At that time, workers being beaten and scolded was a common occurrence, and incidents of capitalists and their lackeys finding excuses to beat our class brothers to death were not uncommon.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The deeper the oppression, the stronger the resistance. From the day the Chinese working class was born, it has never stopped resisting and fighting against all exploiting classes. Since we had the savior Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we, the working class, found our great leader and our party, and we became even more clear-headed and confident. In every revolutionary movement, we played a leading and vanguard role. It can be said that the history of the Chinese revolution is the history of the Chinese working class ascending and occupying the political stage, and it is the history of the Chinese working class leading the Chinese revolution to victory.

However, the top capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, trying to erase the class contradictions and class struggles during the transitional period, and erase the leading role of the working class in the revolution. His purpose was to restore capitalism in China, turning the state of proletarian dictatorship led by the working class into a state of bourgeois dictatorship, making us workers and the broad laboring people once again become slaves to the landlords and capitalists.

Re-studying the report of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee made us see more clearly the reactionary nature of the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, and also made us realize the great responsibility we bear. We, the working class, will not betray the trust and expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao. We must fulfill the great historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

To insist on the leadership of the working class is to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat

Zhao Shizhong, a member of the Revolutionary Committee and a worker representative, said:

On the eve of the nation's liberation, Chairman Mao warned us: "The state power of the People's Republic led by the working class must be strengthened, not weakened, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution." Here, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that our state power must be led by the working class; to strengthen our state power, we must first strengthen the leadership of the working class.

Power is our right to exist and our right to life. The class that holds power in its hands determines the nature of power. Our country is a state of proletarian dictatorship and must be led and governed by the working class. To insist on the leadership of the working class is to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The working class must lead everything. This is Chairman Mao's consistent thought and the fundamental policy to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Over the past nineteen years since liberation, Chairman Mao's great thought has not been well implemented. The culprit is the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi, this scoundrel, in order to usurp the party and the state, and change the color of our country, did everything he could to oppose the leadership of the working class and tried to implement bourgeois dictatorship. Not long after Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he secretly went to Tianjin and colluded with the big capitalists, encouraging them and cheering for them. At the same time, he fiercely opposed the leadership of the working class, saying nonsense like "the working class may also be unreliable" and "don't think that relying on the working class is problem-free," and so on. Liu Shaoqi's series of lies fully exposed his capitalist-roader face. Liu Shaoqi's agent in the railway system took his black master's words as a decree and even more fiercely implemented them in our station district, madly excluding and striking at the workers. The main leadership power of our station district was usurped by a handful of traitors, spies, capitalist-roaders, and counter-revolutionaries. These people colluded with each other, did evil, and made our station district chaotic. Workers were struck and excluded, while a handful of class enemies were well-fed and highly regarded. Just take our loading and unloading workers as an example. The capitalist-roaders even instructed a traitor and counter-revolutionary to control, restrict, and oppress us workers. In the workshop, they also set up several freight clerks to specially monitor our work.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, we, the working class, took power back from the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We, the working class, must hold power well and use power well for the revolution, ensuring that the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat will never change color.

Relying wholeheartedly on the working class means invincibility

Zhu Dezhi, an office worker of the Revolutionary Committee, and Wang Xiangzhi, the instructor of the Third Team, said:

The working class is the most advanced class and the most revolutionary class. In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao sharply and profoundly criticized the fallacy of opposing the leadership of the working class and wisely pointed out: "We must rely wholeheartedly on the working class, unite with other laboring masses, win over the intellectuals, win over as many national bourgeoisie elements and their representatives as possible to stand on our side, or make them remain neutral, so as to firmly fight against the imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bureaucrat capitalists and gradually defeat these enemies." From our struggle practice, we deeply feel that relying on the working class means unlimited power and invincibility; without the working class, we will achieve nothing and will definitely go astray. Whether to rely on the working class or not is a fundamental issue in the struggle between the two lines and a watershed between revolution and non-revolution.

After the working class in our station district took power, together with the broad revolutionary masses, we actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully played the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The broad worker comrades displayed the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, waged a war against all unreasonable rules and regulations, and in a few days, put forward hundreds of revolutionary initiatives. Worker comrades also voluntarily formed part-time investigation teams, conducted in-depth and detailed investigations and research using Mao Zedong Thought, and quickly smashed all the old frameworks of the old railway system to pieces, establishing a new revolutionary order. The revolutionary criticism, cleaning up of class ranks, rectification of the party, and streamlining of personnel in our station were all achieved with great success because we firmly relied on the working class. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of our station, according to the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, entered a "hard-to-handle" unit. Worker comrades used Mao Zedong Thought to help and educate the revolutionary youngsters, quickly achieved the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, established the revolutionary committee, and launched a new high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation. The facts fully prove that the working class not only must lead everything but also has the ability to lead everything.

The working class must occupy all positions in the superstructure

Zhao Baocheng, a worker technician, said:

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." We, the working class, personally participate in the three great revolutionary struggles, are the richest in practical experience, the wisest, and the most talented. Not only can we lead politics, but we can also lead science and technology well. In the past, the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi promoted a set of revisionist lines such as "experts manage factories" and "technology first." We workers had no say in technical matters. In 1959, Liu Shaoqi proposed in Tianjin that the station should have "gantry cranes everywhere and conveyor belts (conveyors) everywhere." The capitalist-roaders in our station district immediately followed suit, inviting a group of reactionary "authorities" to close the door and make a so-called "plan" for the mechanization of the station. They designed for three months and manufactured for a year for a gantry crane, but it still could not be used. They made thirty-two conveyor belts in total, but none of them could be used, turning good steel into scrap iron. Workers angrily said, "This is not about innovation, it's purely sabotage!"

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." To improve work efficiency and reduce the labor intensity of workers, we decided to make a combined coal unloading machine by our own efforts. When they heard that the loading and unloading workers were making a coal unloading machine, a few reactionary "authorities" sneered, "Loading and unloading workers want to make a coal unloading machine, this is like a chicken coop wanting to fly out a golden phoenix, it's impossible!" We firmly replied, "The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create any miracle in the world!" We followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "learning war from war," learning while doing. After a year of hard work, we finally made a new type of combined coal unloading machine with high work efficiency and low cost on the eve of July 1st this year, giving the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" a hard blow. Ordinary loading and unloading workers became the masters of technology, holding the power of science and technology. In the future, they will surely create more miracles in the world.

Re-studying Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, we, the working class, are more red-hearted and determined, and full of enthusiasm. We are determined to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With the majestic steps of the working class, we will occupy all the stages of struggle-criticism-transformation in the superstructure, fully play the leading role in the cultural revolution and all work, and achieve the complete victory of the cultural revolution.
