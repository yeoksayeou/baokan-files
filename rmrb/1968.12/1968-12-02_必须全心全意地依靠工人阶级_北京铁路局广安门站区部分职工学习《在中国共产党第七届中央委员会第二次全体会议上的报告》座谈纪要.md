Part of the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau Guang'anmen Station District studied the report of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China while studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. Through the study, everyone felt from the bottom of their hearts that Chairman Mao stood the highest and saw the farthest. As early as the eve of the nation's victory, Chairman Mao deeply analyzed the classes, class contradictions, and class struggles after the nation's victory, and wisely proposed the program and line for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, pointing out the direction for us to continue advancing. Studying Chairman Mao's report, recalling the facts of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines over the past nineteen years, the more we study, the more we feel Chairman Mao's words are extremely intimate, and the more we study, the more we feel our hearts are particularly bright.

Only the working class can lead the revolution

Liu Jinglu, the instructor of the Second Loading and Unloading Team and an old worker, said:

Whether or not to rely on the working class leadership, whether or not to rely on the working class, is a fundamental issue concerning what kind of country we should build after the nation's victory and what path we should take. Around this issue, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by Liu Shaoqi have been in fierce struggle.

Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of our working class. He has always represented the interests of the working class, supported the working class, and spoken for the working class. He values us, the working class, the most. In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao pointed out wisely: "The proletariat and its party, because of the oppression of several enemies, have been tempered and have the qualifications to lead the Chinese people's revolution. Whoever overlooks or belittles this will commit the error of right opportunism."

Before liberation, China was a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. The Chinese people had three mountains on their heads, and we, the working class, were at the bottom. In those days, our worker families had no grain to eat the next day, no complete clothes to wear, empty hands, and nothing to our name, and we faced the danger of unemployment at any time. I started working in Tianjin's Sixth Gate for the capitalists as a "laborer" when I was over ten years old and suffered greatly in the old society. Capitalists often said, "It's hard to find a three-legged toad, but there are plenty of two-legged people." At that time, workers being beaten and scolded was a common occurrence, and incidents of capitalists and their lackeys finding excuses to beat our class brothers to death were not uncommon.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The deeper the oppression, the stronger the resistance. From the day the Chinese working class was born, it has never stopped resisting and fighting against all exploiting classes. Since we had the savior Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we, the working class, found our great leader and our party, and we became even more clear-headed and confident. In every revolutionary movement, we played a leading and vanguard role. It can be said that the history of the Chinese revolution is the history of the Chinese working class ascending and occupying the political stage, and it is the history of the Chinese working class leading the Chinese revolution to victory.

However, the top capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, trying to erase the class contradictions and class struggles during the transitional period, and erase the leading role of the working class in the revolution. His purpose was to restore capitalism in China, turning the state of proletarian dictatorship led by the working class into a state of bourgeois dictatorship, making us workers and the broad laboring people once again become slaves to the landlords and capitalists.

Re-studying the report of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee made us see more clearly the reactionary nature of the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, and also made us realize the great responsibility we bear. We, the working class, will not betray the trust and expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao. We must fulfill the great historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

To insist on the leadership of the working class is to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat

Zhao Shizhong, a member of the Revolutionary Committee and a worker representative, said:

On the eve of the nation's liberation, Chairman Mao warned us: "The state power of the People's Republic led by the working class must be strengthened, not weakened, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution." Here, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that our state power must be led by the working class; to strengthen our state power, we must first strengthen the leadership of the working class.

Power is our right to exist and our right to life. The class that holds power in its hands determines the nature of power. Our country is a state of proletarian dictatorship and must be led and governed by the working class. To insist on the leadership of the working class is to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The working class must lead everything. This is Chairman Mao's consistent thought and the fundamental policy to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Over the past nineteen years since liberation, Chairman Mao's great thought has not been well implemented. The culprit is the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi, this scoundrel, in order to usurp the party and the state, and change the color of our country, did everything he could to oppose the leadership of the working class and tried to implement bourgeois dictatorship. Not long after Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he secretly went to Tianjin and colluded with the big capitalists, encouraging them and cheering for them. At the same time, he fiercely opposed the leadership of the working class, saying nonsense like "the working class may also be unreliable" and "don't think that relying on the working class is problem-free," and so on. Liu Shaoqi's series of lies fully exposed his capitalist-roader face. Liu Shaoqi's agent in the railway system took his black master's words as a decree and even more fiercely implemented them in our station district, madly excluding and striking at the workers. The main leadership power of our station district was usurped by a handful of traitors, spies, capitalist-roaders, and counter-revolutionaries. These people colluded with each other, did evil, and made our station district chaotic. Workers were struck and excluded, while a handful of class enemies were well-fed and highly regarded. Just take our loading and unloading workers as an example. The capitalist-roaders even instructed a traitor and counter-revolutionary to control, restrict, and oppress us workers. In the workshop, they also set up several freight clerks to specially monitor our work.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, we, the working class, took power back from the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We, the working class, must hold power well and use power well for the revolution, ensuring that the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat will never change color.

Relying wholeheartedly on the working class means invincibility

Zhu Dezhi, an office worker of the Revolutionary Committee, and Wang Xiangzhi, the instructor of the Third Team, said:

The working class is the most advanced class and the most revolutionary class. In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao sharply and profoundly criticized the fallacy of opposing the leadership of the working class and wisely pointed out: "We must rely wholeheartedly on the working class, unite with other laboring masses, win over the intellectuals, win over as many national bourgeoisie elements and their representatives as possible to stand on our side, or make them remain neutral, so as to firmly fight against the imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bureaucrat capitalists and gradually defeat these enemies." From our struggle practice, we deeply feel that relying on the working class means unlimited power and invincibility; without the working class, we will achieve nothing and will definitely go astray. Whether to rely on the working class or not is a fundamental issue in the struggle between the two lines and a watershed between revolution and non-revolution.

After the working class in our station district took power, together with the broad revolutionary masses, we actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully played the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The broad worker comrades displayed the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, waged a war against all unreasonable rules and regulations, and in a few days, put forward hundreds of revolutionary initiatives. Worker comrades also voluntarily formed part-time investigation teams, conducted in-depth and detailed investigations and research using Mao Zedong Thought, and quickly smashed all the old frameworks of the old railway system to pieces, establishing a new revolutionary order. The revolutionary criticism, cleaning up of class ranks, rectification of the party, and streamlining of personnel in our station were all achieved with great success because we firmly relied on the working class. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of our station, according to the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, entered a "hard-to-handle" unit. Worker comrades used Mao Zedong Thought to help and educate the revolutionary youngsters, quickly achieved the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, established the revolutionary committee, and launched a new high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation. The facts fully prove that the working class not only must lead everything but also has the ability to lead everything.

The working class must occupy all positions in the superstructure

Zhao Baocheng, a worker technician, said:

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." We, the working class, personally participate in the three great revolutionary struggles, are the richest in practical experience, the wisest, and the most talented. Not only can we lead politics, but we can also lead science and technology well. In the past, the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi promoted a set of revisionist lines such as "experts manage factories" and "technology first." We workers had no say in technical matters. In 1959, Liu Shaoqi proposed in Tianjin that the station should have "gantry cranes everywhere and conveyor belts (conveyors) everywhere." The capitalist-roaders in our station district immediately followed suit, inviting a group of reactionary "authorities" to close the door and make a so-called "plan" for the mechanization of the station. They designed for three months and manufactured for a year for a gantry crane, but it still could not be used. They made thirty-two conveyor belts in total, but none of them could be used, turning good steel into scrap iron. Workers angrily said, "This is not about innovation, it's purely sabotage!"

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." To improve work efficiency and reduce the labor intensity of workers, we decided to make a combined coal unloading machine by our own efforts. When they heard that the loading and unloading workers were making a coal unloading machine, a few reactionary "authorities" sneered, "Loading and unloading workers want to make a coal unloading machine, this is like a chicken coop wanting to fly out a golden phoenix, it's impossible!" We firmly replied, "The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create any miracle in the world!" We followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "learning war from war," learning while doing. After a year of hard work, we finally made a new type of combined coal unloading machine with high work efficiency and low cost on the eve of July 1st this year, giving the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" a hard blow. Ordinary loading and unloading workers became the masters of technology, holding the power of science and technology. In the future, they will surely create more miracles in the world.

Re-studying Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, we, the working class, are more red-hearted and determined, and full of enthusiasm. We are determined to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With the majestic steps of the working class, we will occupy all the stages of struggle-criticism-transformation in the superstructure, fully play the leading role in the cultural revolution and all work, and achieve the complete victory of the cultural revolution.

    必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级
    北京铁路局广安门站区部分职工学习《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》座谈纪要
    北京铁路局广安门站区部分革命职工，在学习党的八届十二中全会公报的同时，重新学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这个光辉的历史文献。通过学习，大家都打心眼里感到：毛主席站得最高，看得最远。早在全国胜利的前夕，毛主席就深刻地分析了全国胜利后的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，英明地提出了中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的纲领和路线，给我们指出了继续前进的方向。学习毛主席这篇报告，回想十九年来阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的事实，越学越感到毛主席的话无比亲切，越学越觉得心里特别亮堂。
        只有工人阶级才能领导革命
    装卸二连指导员、老工人刘景禄说：
    要不要工人阶级领导，要不要依靠工人阶级？这是关系到全国胜利以后，我们要建设一个什么样的国家，要走什么道路的根本问题。围绕着这个问题，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，一直进行着激烈的斗争。
    毛主席是我们工人阶级最伟大的领袖，他老人家一贯代表工人阶级的利益，为工人阶级撑腰，替工人阶级说话，最看重我们工人阶级。毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告中就英明地指出：“无产阶级及其政党，由于受到几重敌人的压迫，得到了锻炼，具有了领导中国人民革命的资格。谁要是忽视或轻视了这一点，谁就要犯右倾机会主义的错误。”
    解放前，中国是一个半封建、半殖民地的国家。中国人民头上有三座大山，我们工人阶级压在最底层。在那年月，我们工人家无隔夜粮，身无囫囵衣，两手空空，一无所有，随时都有失业的危险。我十多岁就在天津六号门给资本家当“苦力”，受尽了旧社会的煎熬。资本家经常说：“三条腿的蛤蟆找不到，两条腿的人有的是。”那时，工人挨打受骂是家常便饭，资本家和狗腿子找碴打死我们阶级兄弟的事也不断发生。
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，受压迫越深，反抗就越强。中国工人阶级从它诞生的那一天起，就一刻也没有停止过对一切剥削阶级的反抗和斗争。自从有了救星毛主席和中国共产党的领导，我们工人阶级找到了自己的伟大领袖，有了自己的政党，就更加心明眼亮，信心百倍。在历次革命运动中，都起了领导和先锋作用。可以说，中国革命的历史，就是中国工人阶级登上和占领政治舞台的历史，就是中国工人阶级领导中国革命胜利前进的历史。
    但是，党内头号走资派刘少奇，疯狂地反对毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，拚命抹煞过渡时期的阶级矛盾、阶级斗争，抹煞工人阶级的革命领导作用，他的目的，就是要在中国实行资本主义复辟，把工人阶级领导的无产阶级专政的国家变成资产阶级专政的国家，叫我们工人和广大劳动人民，重新给地主、资本家当牛作马。
    重新学习七届二中全会报告，使我们更加看清了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的反动本质，也使我们更加认识到自己肩上担负的责任有多么重大。我们工人阶级决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的信任和期望，一定要很好地完成毛主席交给我们的伟大的历史使命。
  坚持工人阶级领导就是坚持无产阶级专政
    革委会委员、工人代表赵世忠说：
    毛主席在全国解放前夕，就告诫我们：“工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化。”毛主席在这里，明确指出了我们的国家政权，必须由工人阶级领导；要强化我们的国家政权，首先就要强化工人阶级领导。
    政权是我们的生存权、生命权。政权掌握在那一个阶级的手里，决定着政权的性质。我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家，必须由工人阶级来领导，来掌权。坚持工人阶级领导就是坚持无产阶级专政。
    工人阶级必须领导一切，这是毛主席的一贯思想，是巩固无产阶级专政的根本方针。解放十九年来，毛主席这一伟大思想，没有得到很好的贯彻执行，罪魁祸首是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。刘少奇这个坏蛋，为了篡党篡政，改变我们国家的颜色，竭尽全力反对工人阶级的领导，妄图实行资产阶级专政。毛主席在七届二中全会上报告后不久，他就偷偷溜到天津，和大资本家勾勾搭搭，给他们鼓气，为他们叫好。同时，他拚命反对工人阶级领导，胡说什么工人阶级“也可能是不能依靠的”，“不要以为依靠工人阶级是没有问题的”等等。刘少奇的这一派谰言，充分暴露了他的工贼嘴脸。刘少奇在铁路系统的代理人，把他黑主子的话当成圣旨，变本加厉地在我们站区推行，疯狂地排挤和打击工人。我们站区的主要领导权，被一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派、反革命分子篡夺了。这些家伙串通一气，为非作歹，把我们站区搞得乌烟瘴气。工人受打击、受排挤，一小撮阶级敌人却吃得开，受重用。就拿我们装卸工来说吧，走资派竟指使一个汉奸、反革命分子对我们工人实行管、卡、压。在车间还设置几个货运员，专门监视我们的工作。
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工人阶级把权从资产阶级手里夺回来了。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气。我们工人阶级要为革命掌好权，用好权，保证无产阶级专政的政权永不变色。
    全心全意依靠工人阶级就无往而不胜
    革委会办事员朱德智，三连指导员王祥志说：
    工人阶级是最先进的阶级，最革命的阶级。毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告中，尖锐而深刻地批判了那种反对依靠工人阶级领导的谬论，英明地指出：“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动群众，争取知识分子，争取尽可能多的能够同我们合作的民族资产阶级分子及其代表人物站在我们方面，或者使他们保持中立，以便向帝国主义者、国民党、官僚资产阶级作坚决的斗争，一步一步地去战胜这些敌人。”我们从斗争实践中深深体会到：依靠工人阶级就力量无穷，无往不胜；离开工人阶级就一事无成，必然走上邪路。依靠不依靠工人阶级，这是两条路线斗争的一个根本问题，是革命不革命的分水岭。
    我们站区工人阶级掌权后，和广大革命群众一起，活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，充分发挥了工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。广大工人同志发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，向一切不合理的规章制度开战，不几天时间，就提出了几百条革命倡议。工人同志还自动组成业余调查小组，用毛泽东思想进行深入细致的调查研究工作，很快就把旧铁路系统的一切旧框框砸了个稀巴烂，建立了革命的新秩序。我们车站的革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党建党、精兵简政等工作，都是由于坚决依靠了工人阶级，才取得了很大成绩。我们站区的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，根据伟大领袖毛主席的命令，进驻了一个“老大难”的单位。工人同志用毛泽东思想帮助和教育革命小将，很快就实现了全校的革命大联合和革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会，掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。事实充分说明了：工人阶级不但必须领导一切，而且有能力领导一切。
    工人阶级一定要占领上层建筑一切阵地
    工人技术员赵宝成说：
    毛主席教导我们：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。我们工人阶级亲自参加三大革命斗争的实践，最富有实践经验，最聪明，最有才能。不但能够领导政治，也能够领导好科学技术。过去工贼刘少奇推行“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等一套修正主义路线，我们工人无权过问技术上的事。一九五九年，刘少奇在天津提出在车站要搞“吊杆成林、溜板（输送机）成群”。我们站区的走资派也马上紧跟，请来了一帮反动“权威”，闭门造车，搞出了一个车站机械化的所谓“规划”。他们为了搞一架龙门吊车，设计了三个月，制作了一年，结果还是不能用。他们先后造了三十二台输送机，一台也不能用，把好钢变成了废铁。工人气愤地说：“这那里是搞革新，纯粹是搞破坏！”
    无产阶级文化大革命中，我们响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，为了提高工作效率，减轻工人劳动强度，决定自力更生制造联合卸煤机。听说装卸工要造卸煤机，几个反动“权威”讥笑说：“装卸工想做卸煤机，这是鸡窝里想飞出金凤凰，办不到！”我们坚定地回答：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来！”我们按照毛主席“从战争学习战争”的伟大教导，边学边干。经过一年苦战，终于在今年“七一”前夕，制成了工效高、造价低的新型联合卸煤机，以铁的事实给了工贼刘少奇和资产阶级反动“权威”当头一棒。普通的装卸工人做了技术的主人，掌握了科学技术的大权，今后将会不断创造出更多的人间奇迹。
    重新学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，我们工人阶级更加心红志坚，豪情满怀。我们决心永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，以工人阶级的雄伟步伐，占领一切上层建筑领域斗、批、改的历史舞台，在文化大革命和一切工作中充分发挥领导作用，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
