We have focused on three major tasks
— The Experience of Le Yuan Commune in Implementing the Cooperative Medical System
Hubei Province Changyang County Le Yuan Commune Revolutionary Committee

December 5, the People's Daily published a report on our commune's implementation of the cooperative medical system and added an editorial note, stating that this is "a new phenomenon that has emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," and proposed to discuss it nationwide. This is the greatest concern, support, and encouragement from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants! We repeatedly and enthusiastically shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!"

After the report on our commune's implementation of the cooperative medical system was published, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary medical workers across the country enthusiastically participated in the discussion, giving us great education and help. To exchange experiences and make the cooperative medical system more perfect and solid, we hereby report the bits and pieces of our commune's experience over the past two years in implementing this system. We sincerely hope that everyone will supplement and correct any mistakes in the discussion. There is a lot of work to be done in implementing the cooperative medical system. We mainly focused on three major tasks:

First, firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the medical and health affairs in rural areas is the primary prerequisite for implementing the cooperative medical system.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power." From practice, we deeply understand that the center of the two-line struggle on the medical and health front has always been about the struggle for medical and health power. The poor and lower-middle peasants want to implement the cooperative medical system and must first seize back the medical and health power that has been usurped by the capitalist roaders in the health department; only when the poor and lower-middle peasants firmly manage the medical and health affairs in rural areas, can the cooperative medical system be continuously consolidated, perfected, and developed. When our commune's poor and lower-middle peasants decided to implement the cooperative medical system, the first major revolutionary action they took was to thoroughly eliminate the "single-line leadership" of the old health system and establish a management organization composed mainly of representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, combined with revolutionary cadre representatives, militia representatives, and revolutionary medical personnel. The commune established a cooperative medical management committee, and the six production brigades respectively established cooperative medical management groups. They are under the unified leadership of the commune revolutionary committee and the brigade leadership groups, specially responsible for cooperative medical work. The members participating in the cooperative medical management committee and management groups are outstanding representatives from all aspects. They are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and love the cooperative medical cause most. They always put their own ideological transformation in the first place, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to navigate above and relying on the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants below. They persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, regularly reporting the situation of cooperative medical work to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, listening to everyone's opinions, and thus speeding up the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions on health work. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically praised them as "pioneers of the medical and health revolution, good managers of cooperative medical care, and vanguard fighters loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian health line."

Second, arming the broad masses with Chairman Mao's proletarian health line is the fundamental guarantee for implementing the cooperative medical system.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know it." "When the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will work together." The process of our commune implementing the cooperative medical system and continuously consolidating and developing it fully proves the extraordinary wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's teachings. Before formally implementing the cooperative medical system, our commune's poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad revolutionary masses spent about two months repeatedly studying the great leader Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions such as "putting the focus of medical and health work in rural areas," using Chairman Mao's proletarian health line as a sharp weapon, through exposing the bitterness of lacking doctors and medicine in rural areas, exposing the bitterness of being cheated by witch doctors and quacks, and launching a big exposure and criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line of the big traitor, big spy, and big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Chairman Mao's proletarian health line deeply understood from the historical experience of the two-line struggle in our commune that only by thoroughly smashing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line, organizing themselves, and implementing cooperative medical care, can they achieve thorough liberation in disease prevention and treatment. Thus, a great mass movement to promote cooperative medical care quickly swept across the entire commune. Over the past two years, the broad revolutionary masses in our commune have continuously studied and applied Chairman Mao's proletarian health line, fiercely exposing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, promoting the cooperative medical system to develop victoriously.

Third, striving to build a medical and health team that serves the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly is an important condition for implementing the cooperative medical system.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Comrade White is selfless and dedicated to others, which is reflected in his extreme responsibility for his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist Party member should learn from him." Our commune now has twelve medical personnel. Except for two who come from well-off middle peasant families, the rest are from poor and lower-middle peasant families. They are loyal to Chairman Mao, love Chairman Mao's proletarian health line, and understand the pain of their class brothers when they are sick. Therefore, the vast majority of them have the determination to protect the health of their class brothers and dedicate themselves to rural medical and health work. However, with the reform of the medical system, their souls have all undergone a fierce struggle between public and private interests. In this struggle, on the one hand, we used the "Three Articles" as a weapon to help them seriously criticize and transform their private interests, thoroughly reform their old worldview, and gradually establish the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly; on the other hand, we focused on the education of the history of the two-line struggle on the health front, mobilizing all medical personnel to repeatedly expose and accuse the big traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line that brought pain to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and highly praise and sing the happiness that Chairman Mao's proletarian health line brought to the poor and lower-middle peasants, continuously improving the medical personnel's awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle. In this way, these medical personnel played an active role in consolidating and developing the cooperative medical system.

We believe that by focusing on the above issues, the cooperative medical system can be implemented, consolidated, and developed.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly." We will follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, learn from the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants across the country, and make the cooperative medical system better and better. We will also fully implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    我们狠抓了三件大事
    ——乐园公社实行合作医疗制度的经验
    湖北省长阳县乐园公社革命委员会
    十二月五日《人民日报》发表了我们公社实行合作医疗制度的报道，并加了编者按，指出这“是一件无产阶级文化大革命中出现的新事物”，提出在全国展开讨论。这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部对我们广大贫下中农的最大关怀，最大支持，最大鼓舞！我们千遍万遍地纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    我们公社实行合作医疗制度的报道发表后，全国广大贫下中农、革命干部和革命医务工作者十分热烈地参加讨论，给我们以极大的教育和帮助。为了交流情况，使合作医疗制度不断完善、更加巩固，在这里，我们把我公社两年来实行这一制度的点滴体会作一汇报，诚恳地希望大家在讨论中加以补充，不对的地方，欢迎大家指正。实行合作医疗制度，要做的工作很多，我们主要狠抓了三件大事：
    第一，坚定不移地依靠贫下中农掌管农村的医疗卫生大权，是实行合作医疗制度的首要前提。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”从实践中我们深刻地认识到：在医疗卫生战线上两条路线斗争的中心，一直是围绕着争夺医疗卫生大权的问题。贫下中农要实行合作医疗制度，必须首先夺回被卫生部门的走资派篡夺去的医疗卫生大权；也只有贫下中农牢牢掌管农村的医疗卫生大权，才能使合作医疗制度不断巩固、完善和发展。当我们公社的贫下中农决定实行合作医疗制度的时候，采取的第一个重大革命行动，就是彻底革除旧卫生系统的“单线领导”，建立以贫下中农代表为主体，结合革命干部代表、民兵代表和革命医务人员组成的管理机构。公社成立了合作医疗管理委员会，六个生产大队分别成立了合作医疗管理小组，它们在公社革委会和生产大队领导小组的统一领导下，专门负责合作医疗工作。参加合作医疗管理委员会和管理小组的成员，是各方面的优秀代表，他们忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，最热爱合作医疗事业，一心向着贫下中农。他们一直把自身的思想革命化放在首位，上靠毛泽东思想领航，下靠贫下中农支持。他们坚持活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚持向广大贫下中农定期汇报合作医疗工作情况，听取大家的意见，这样作就加快落实了毛主席关于卫生工作的指示。广大贫下中农热情地赞扬他们是“医疗卫生革命的带头人，合作医疗的好管家，忠于毛主席无产阶级卫生路线的先锋战士”。
    第二，用毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线武装广大群众，是实行合作医疗制度的根本保证。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。”我们公社实行合作医疗制度并且不断得到巩固和发展的过程，完全证明了毛主席这些教导的无比英明，无比正确。在正式实行合作医疗制度前，我们公社的贫下中农和广大革命群众，用了两个月左右的时间，反复学习伟大领袖毛主席关于“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”等一系列光辉指示，以毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线为锐利武器，通过大讲农村缺医少药的苦，大讲受巫医、假医欺诈的苦，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线展开了大揭发、大批判。用毛主席无产阶级卫生路线武装起来的广大贫下中农，从本公社两条路线斗争的历史经验中，深刻地认识到，只有彻底摧毁刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，自己组织起来，实行合作医疗，才能在防病、治病上获得彻底解放。于是，一个大办合作医疗的伟大群众运动迅速在全公社范围内掀起。两年来，我们公社的广大革命群众不断地学习、运用毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线，狠揭、狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，推动着合作医疗制度胜利地向前发展。
    第三，努力建设一支全心全意为贫下中农服务的医疗卫生队伍，是实行合作医疗制度的重要条件。
    毛主席教导我们：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”我们公社现在有十二名医务人员，除两人出身于富裕中农家庭外，其余的都是贫农和下中农家庭出身，他们忠于毛主席，热爱毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线，对自己阶级兄弟患病的痛苦最了解。因此他们当中绝大多数人具有保护自己阶级兄弟的健康，献身于农村医疗卫生事业的决心。但是，随着医疗制度的改革，使他们的灵魂深处，都经历了一场公与私的剧烈斗争。在这场斗争中，我们一方面以“老三篇”为武器，帮助他们认真斗私批修，彻底改造旧的世界观，逐步树立全心全意为人民服务的观点；另一方面大抓卫生战线上两条路线斗争史的教育，发动全体医务人员，反复揭发、控诉大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线给贫下中农带来的痛苦，大赞大颂毛主席无产阶级卫生路线给贫下中农带来的幸福，不断地提高医务人员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。这样，这些医务人员在巩固和发展合作医疗制度中，就发挥了积极作用。
    我们认为，抓住了以上这几个问题，合作医疗制度就可以实现、巩固和发展。
    毛主席教导说：“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”。我们决心遵循毛主席的伟大教导，向工人阶级和全国贫下中农学习，把合作医疗办得好上加好，更要全面贯彻执行党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。　（新华社）
