New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcox issued a statement pointing out that the world revolutionary situation is excellent. China and Albania are becoming increasingly strong, imperialism is mired in the quagmire, and the Soviet revisionist clique is disintegrating. He calls on the New Zealand people to persist in the struggle against American imperialism and the rule of domestic monopoly capital.

The New Zealand News Agency, Wellington, December 19th: New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcox comrade issued a statement in the "Voice of the People" weekly on the 17th, reviewing the excellent revolutionary situation over the past year, and calling on the New Zealand people to persist in the struggle against American imperialism and the rule of domestic monopoly capital, and to strive unremittingly for the realization of socialism in New Zealand.

The statement said: "Over the past year, class struggle in New Zealand has become increasingly sharp. On the economic front, there have been many strikes and demonstrations. To oppose the government's support for American imperialism in the Vietnam issue, there have also been many strikes and demonstrations. Students have also taken large-scale protest actions against the government's plan to set up the 'Omega' submarine navigation system (for American nuclear submarines).

"All this shows that the working class and its allies are counterattacking the government's subservience to foreign, especially American, industrial and financial monopoly capital's control over New Zealand.

"This healthy development of fighting spirit is a good omen for 1969. As the shaky imperialist, monopoly capitalist world sinks deeper into the quagmire, the situation will get better and better."

The statement pointed out that the ruling class in New Zealand is shifting financial and other difficulties onto the laboring people to protect big monopoly capital. Now, more and more people are beginning to realize that they cannot place their hopes in the bourgeois "elections," because bourgeois parties can only implement capitalism and seek profits for big monopoly capital. Only the rule of the workers can provide a way out.

The statement said: "It is for this reason that the Communist Party emphasizes the necessity of socialism, which is not a distant future matter, but a matter to be fought for now.

"The struggle for socialism in New Zealand needs to be carried out unremittingly, and it is necessary to expose and defeat American imperialism and its New Zealand puppets."

In discussing the excellent revolutionary situation in the world, the statement said: "This year, people have seen the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has greatly strengthened the proletarian state power of China. This is a victory for Marxism-Leninism, achieved under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong.

"This year, people have also seen the Soviet Union developing in the opposite direction. In the Soviet Union, the Soviet revisionist leaders who betrayed socialism have restored capitalism.

"Socialist China is becoming stronger and stronger. Socialist Albania is the same. But the Soviet revisionist clique is disintegrating.

"This is a good thing for the people of the world, because the Soviet Union is now colluding with American imperialism to divide the world into spheres of influence."

The statement concluded by saying that the New Zealand Communist Party expects to see greater and more fruitful struggles in 1969, and it guarantees to stand at the forefront of these struggles.

    新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯发表声明指出
    世界革命形势一片大好
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚日益强盛　帝国主义深陷泥潭　苏修集团分崩离析号召新西兰人民为反对美帝国主义和本国垄断资本统治而坚持斗争
    新华社惠灵顿十九日电　新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯同志十七日在《人民之声》周报上发表声明，回顾一年来大好的革命形势，号召新西兰人民坚持反对美帝国主义以及本国垄断资本统治的斗争，为在新西兰实现社会主义而进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    声明说：“一年来新西兰阶级斗争全面尖锐化。在经济战线上发生了许多罢工斗争和示威，为了反对政府在越南问题上支持美帝国主义，也发生了许多罢工斗争和示威。学生也采取了大规模的抗议行动，反对政府关于设置（为美国核潜艇导航的）‘欧米加’潜艇导航系统的计划。
    “这一切表明，工人阶级及其同盟者正在反击政府屈从于外国、特别是美国工业和金融垄断资本对新西兰的控制的做法。
    “这种斗志昂扬的战斗精神的健康发展，对于一九六九年是一个良好的预兆。随着摇摇欲坠的帝国主义、垄断资本主义世界越来越深地陷入泥潭，形势将会越来越好。”
    声明指出，新西兰的统治集团正在把财政和其他困难转嫁给劳动人民，以便保护大垄断资本。现在，越来越多的人开始认识到不能把希望寄托在资产阶级的“选举”上面，因为资产阶级政党只能是推行资本主义，为大垄断资本牟取利润。只有工人的政权才能提供出路。
    声明说：“正因为如此，共产党才强调社会主义的必要性，这不是遥远将来的事，而是目前为之斗争的事。
    “新西兰争取社会主义的斗争，需要坚持不懈地进行，需要揭露和击败美帝国主义及其新西兰的傀儡。”
    声明在谈到世界大好的革命形势时说：“人们在这一年看到了中国文化大革命的胜利，这一胜利大大加强了中国的工人阶级国家政权。这是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是在伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东的领导下取得的。
    “人们在这一年还看到了苏联朝着相反的方向发展。在苏联，背叛了社会主义的苏修领导人复辟了资本主义。
    “社会主义中国愈来愈强大。社会主义阿尔巴尼亚也是这样。但是苏修集团在分崩离析。
    “这对世界人民群众是一件好事，因为苏联今天正在勾结美帝国主义把世界划分成势力范围。”
    声明最后说，新西兰共产党期望在一九六九年看到更大的更有成果的斗争，它保证站在这些斗争的前列。
