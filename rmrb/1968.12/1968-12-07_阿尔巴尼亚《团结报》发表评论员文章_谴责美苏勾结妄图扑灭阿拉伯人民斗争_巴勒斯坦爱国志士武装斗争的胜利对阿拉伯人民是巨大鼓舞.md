The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary article on December 6, exposing and condemning the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union in their attempt to extinguish the just struggle of the Arab people.

The article states that the Middle East has long been a market for the United States and the Soviet revisionists to conduct transactions. The article points out that the United States and the Soviet Union have recently used various opportunities to falsely express their desire to establish peace in the Middle East, intending to deceive and cover up their "common plan" to harm the freedom and independence of the Arab peoples of various countries.

The article states that, as in the past, the United States is continuing to use every possible means to assist its Zionist lackeys, making them a direct threat to the Arab peoples of various countries. The butchers of Washington have also signed an agreement with Zionist officials to provide Israel with "Phantom" jet fighter-bombers and other weapons of war.

The article states that at the same time, the Soviet revisionist clique, which has completely surrendered and submitted to the United States, is collaborating closely with Washington, speculating with words of peace, and continuing to exert various pressures to force the Arab peoples of various countries to accept their deceptive schemes of so-called "political solutions."

The article emphasizes that the common conspiracy of the United States and the Soviet Union is to force the Arab peoples of various countries to kneel and sit down with the aggressors, thereby extinguishing the just struggle of the Arab peoples of various countries.

The article concludes by saying that no matter how hard the United States, Zionism, and Soviet revisionism try, their goals will not be achieved. The patriotic fighters of Palestine are fighting resolutely with weapons in hand on the occupied land, which is the best response of the Arab people to them.

The armed struggle of the Palestinian patriotic fighters has already put the aggressors in a great dilemma. The victories achieved by the Palestinian patriotic fighters in the struggle are a great encouragement to the struggle of all Arab peoples against the conspiracies of Zionism, imperialism, and revisionism.

    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》一日发表评论员文章，揭露和谴责美苏勾结，妄图扑灭阿拉伯人民正义斗争的罪行。
    文章说，中东早就成了美帝和苏修进行交易的市场。文章指出，美帝和苏修最近利用种种场合虚假地表示它们要在中东建立和平的愿望，是为了进行欺骗，以掩盖他们企图损害阿拉伯各国人民的自由和独立的“共同计划”。
    文章说，美帝国主义象过去一样，现在正继续利用一切可能，援助它的以色列走狗，使其成为对阿拉伯各国人民的直接威胁。华盛顿的刽子手们还同犹太复国主义的官员签订了一项协定，将向以色列提供“鬼怪式”喷气战斗轰炸机等战争工具。
    文章说，与此同时，完全投降和屈从于美帝的苏联修正主义集团，同华盛顿进行紧密的合作，用和平的言词进行投机，并继续施加种种压力，企图迫使阿拉伯各国人民接受他们兜售的所谓“政治解决”的阴谋诡计。
    文章强调指出，美帝和苏修的共同阴谋是要阿拉伯各国人民屈膝投降，同侵略者坐到一起，从而扑灭阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争。
    文章最后说，不管美帝国主义、犹太复国主义以及苏联修正主义怎样煞费心机，他们的目的决不会得逞。巴勒斯坦的爱国志士在被占领的土地上手拿武器进行坚决的斗争，就是阿拉伯人民对他们的最好的回答。
    巴勒斯坦爱国志士的武装斗争已经使侵略者陷入了极大的困境。巴勒斯坦爱国志士在斗争中所取得的胜利，对全体阿拉伯人民反对犹太复国主义和帝国主义、修正主义阴谋的斗争是一个巨大鼓舞。
