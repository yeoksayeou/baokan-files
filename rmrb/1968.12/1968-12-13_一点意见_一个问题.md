Some Opinions and a Question

In implementing the cooperative medical system in rural areas, I believe it is best managed by the production brigade. If the production brigade manages it, it will be convenient for commune members to see a doctor and get medicine. It will also facilitate the leadership and management of the poor and lower-middle peasants in political and economic matters. This way, it will help save medical funds, benefit production, and allow the poor and lower-middle peasants to re-educate medical personnel. The problem is that some production brigades are relatively small, and the medical funds contributed by commune members can be exhausted by one or two serious patients. When encountering such situations, I think several brigades can combine to manage it together.

Here, I would like to raise another question: Can non-agricultural residents living in rural areas participate in the cooperative medical system?

    一点意见  一个问题
    农村实行合作医疗制度，我认为由大队办最好。大队办，社员看病吃药都方便，又便于贫下中农在政治上、经济上进行领导和管理。这样，既有利于节约医疗基金的开支，又有利于生产，有利于贫下中农对医务人员进行再教育。问题是有的生产大队较小，社员交的一些医疗基金，碰到一两个重病号，就用完了。遇到这样的情况，我认为可以几个大队联合起来办。
    这里，我再提出一个问题：在农村里居住的非农业人口，他们是否可以参加合作医疗？河北省武清县杨村公社革委会副主任　丁九功
