Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the proletarian class and revolutionary masses of Shenyang resolutely implement the great directive of the great leader Chairman Mao to "save and revolutionize." They use the revolutionary criticism and denunciation movement as a driving force to extensively and deeply carry out mass activities to save coal. They have saved tens of thousands of tons of industrial and domestic coal for the state since the beginning of the year. They are determined to save more coal and make new contributions to the socialist construction and the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 14th: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the proletarian class and revolutionary masses of Shenyang resolutely implement the great policy of the great leader Chairman Mao to "save and revolutionize." They use the revolutionary criticism and denunciation movement as a driving force to extensively and deeply carry out mass activities to save coal, saving the state a large amount of industrial and domestic coal.

Since this year, Shenyang has made remarkable achievements in saving coal. The coal consumption per unit of product in factories with large coal consumption such as chemical, glass, metallurgy, and papermaking has been decreasing month by month. The coal consumption for the lives of the broad masses of residents has also been significantly reduced. Since the beginning of the year, the city has saved tens of thousands of tons of industrial and domestic coal.

Shenyang, an important industrial city with a population of over three million, requires a large amount of industrial and domestic coal every year. For many years, due to the stubborn implementation of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in Shenyang, they opposed Chairman Mao's great policy of "building the country through thrift." Every year, a large amount of coal was wasted. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian class and revolutionary masses of Shenyang repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "To make our country prosperous and strong, we need several decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and opposition to waste in building the country through thrift" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." They launched a revolutionary criticism and denunciation movement against the black goods such as "determine production based on coal" and "save to the limit" spread by Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, as well as their implementation of the counter-revolutionary economism of "the more you save, the more you reward; the less you save, the less you reward; if you don't save, you don't get rewarded" in the work of saving. They raised their political awareness of saving coal for the revolution. They are determined to implement Chairman Mao's great directive to "save and revolutionize" with actual actions of saving coal for the state and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the work of grabbing the revolution and promoting production and saving coal, the revolutionary workers of Shenyang Second Woolen Mill regard whether or not to save coal seriously as a major issue of whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's directives. Not long ago, someone showed a tendency of thought that "saving coal is almost enough." Revolutionary workers immediately held Mao Zedong Thought study classes by the boilers and further studied Chairman Mao's great directive to "save and revolutionize." At the same time, they carried out revolutionary criticism and denunciation in front of the boilers. Through these activities, they further raised their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "save and revolutionize" and continued to tap the potential for saving coal. Finally, they decided to save an additional 20% of good coal for the state based on the already saved coal, using the method of mixing 20% gangue. Now, they save an additional hundred tons of industrial coal for the state every month based on the already saved coal.

This year, the revolutionary workers on the industrial, transportation, and commercial fronts of Shenyang have spared no effort to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution activities, saving a large amount of industrial coal. According to incomplete statistics, Shenyang workers have adopted more than ten new technologies for saving coal, such as "smokeless coal-burning machines" and "water-cooled wall-type pulverized coal furnaces." After the revolutionary workers of Shenyang Second Water Pump Factory changed the old boiler to a vertical pulverized coal furnace, they can save 1,400 tons of coal for the state in one heating season. After Shenyang Auxiliary Factory renovated the old boiler, it changed from two boilers to one boiler to meet the needs, saving five tons of industrial coal for the state every day.

Various units have also strengthened the management of coal and plugged the loopholes for coal waste.

At present, with the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the broad revolutionary masses' awareness of the two-line struggle continues to improve, saving coal has become the conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses, and the achievements of saving coal are increasing step by step. They are determined to save more coal and make new contributions to the socialist construction of the country and the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    沈阳工人阶级和革命群众坚决执行毛主席要节约闹革命的指示
    以革命大批判为动力开展群众性节约用煤活动
    全市从年初以来，节约了十多万吨工业和生活用煤。他们决心节约更多的煤炭，为社会主义建设和夺取文化大革命全面胜利作出新贡献
    据新华社沈阳十四日电　在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，沈阳市工人阶级和广大革命群众坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大方针，以革命大批判为动力，广泛、深入地开展了群众性节约用煤活动，为国家节省了大量工业和生活用煤。
    今年以来，沈阳市的节约用煤取得了显著成就。耗煤量比较大的化工、玻璃、冶金、造纸等工厂的单位产品耗煤量逐月下降，广大居民生活用煤的消耗量也有很大节约。全市从年初以来，节约了十多万吨工业和生活用煤。
    有着三百多万人口的重要工业城市沈阳，每年需要大量的工业和生活用煤。多年来，由于沈阳市党内一小撮走资派顽固推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，反对毛主席“勤俭建国”的伟大方针，每年都有大量煤炭白白浪费掉。在无产阶级文化大革命中，沈阳市工人阶级和广大革命群众，反复学习了毛主席“要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的光辉教导，对刘少奇等党内一小撮走资派散布的“以煤定产”“节约到顶”等黑货以及他们在节约工作中推行的“多节约多奖，少节约少奖，不节约不奖”的反革命经济主义，展开了革命的大批判，提高了为革命而节煤的政治觉悟。他们决心用为国家节约煤炭的实际行动，来落实毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大方针，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    在抓革命、促生产和节煤工作中取得显著成绩的沈阳市第二绒织厂革命职工，把是不是认真节约煤炭，看作是不是认真执行毛主席的指示的大问题。不久前，有人流露出“节煤差不多”的思想苗头，革命工人立即在锅炉旁大办毛泽东思想学习班，进一步学习毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大教导，同时在炉前开展了革命大批判。他们通过这些活动，进一步提高了执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”指示的自觉性，继续大挖节煤潜力，最后决定在已经节煤的基础上，再向国家少要百分之二十的好煤，用掺烧百分之二十矸石的办法，进一步为国家节约煤炭。现在，他们在原来节煤的基础上，每月又为国家节约上百吨的工业用煤。
    今年，沈阳工、交、商业战线的广大革命职工，千方百计地开展技术革新和技术革命活动，节省了大量的工业用煤，据不完全统计，沈阳工人今年已经采用了“无烟烧煤机”“水冷壁式粉煤炉”等十几种节煤的新技术。沈阳市第二水泵厂的革命工人把旧锅炉改为竖式粉煤炉以后，一个采暖季节就可以为国家节煤一千四百吨。沈阳市助剂厂改造了旧锅炉后，由原来的两台改为一台就满足了需要，每天为国家节省了五吨工业用煤。
    各单位还普遍加强了煤炭的管理，堵塞了煤炭浪费的漏洞。
    目前，随着斗、批、改的深入发展，广大革命群众两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，节约煤炭成了广大革命群众的自觉行动，节煤成绩步步上升。他们决心节约更多的煤炭，为国家的社会主义建设和夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出新贡献。
