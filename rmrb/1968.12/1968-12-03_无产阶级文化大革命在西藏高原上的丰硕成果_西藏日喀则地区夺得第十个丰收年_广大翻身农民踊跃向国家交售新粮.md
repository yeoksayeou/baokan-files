The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has yielded bountiful harvests on the Tibetan Plateau. The Shigatse (Dayekela) region of Tibet has achieved its tenth consecutive bumper harvest since the democratic reforms. The broad masses of emancipated peasants are enthusiastically selling their new grain to the state.

Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, December 2nd: The broad masses of Tibetan emancipated peasants in the Shigatse region of Tibet have resolutely implemented the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong to "seize the revolution and promote production." Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they have overcome numerous difficulties and achieved the tenth bumper harvest since the democratic reforms in Tibet.

This year, the 1100,000 mu (approx. 183,000 acres) of land in 17 agricultural counties, including Shigatse, Gyangze, Nanggar, Lhünzhub, Shetongmon, Sakya, and Yadong, have seen an increase in yield per unit area and an expansion of the sown area. The total grain yield has increased by 84%. The broad masses of Tibetan emancipated peasants joyfully acclaim that this is a bountiful harvest of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the Tibetan Plateau and a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of Tibetan emancipated peasants in the Shigatse region have used Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to guide the revolution and lead production. Each county has organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and his latest directives. Almost all adults in the region have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the broad masses of emancipated peasants have launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Tibet, Zhou Renshan and Wang Qimei, as well as a handful of class enemies who have not been reformed, such as former serf owners and their agents. The revolutionary criticism has greatly heightened the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of emancipated peasants. Their enthusiasm for production has grown stronger, and the idea of farming for the revolution has become deeply rooted in their hearts, laying a solid ideological foundation for achieving the tenth bumper harvest.

Following Chairman Mao's directive to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," the broad masses of emancipated peasants in the Shigatse region have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, advancing in both the depth and breadth of production. Since this spring, the broad masses of peasants have repaired and built 13,000 irrigation canals and 4,500 reservoirs, expanding the irrigated area by nearly 20,000 mu. The emancipated peasants of Deqingling and Lhünzhub districts in Lhünzhub County have taken Dazhai as their model, cultivating 14,000 mu of wasteland and improving 57,000 mu of soil this year. Paril Town, located on the roof of the world, faced an unusual heavy snow this year, with snow accumulation reaching over 70 centimeters deep. In the face of the severe snow disaster, the emancipated peasants of Paril Town, following Chairman Mao's directive to "carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous battle (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," with the assistance of local troops, braved the biting cold, shoveled away the thick snow, and rushed to rescue, harvest, transport, and thresh, still achieving a good harvest. The yield increased significantly compared to last year. Known as Tibet's granary, the peasants of Jiangzi and Shigatse counties along the Yarlung Zangbo River, under the leadership of various levels of revolutionary committees, armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, overcame floods, and this year's total grain yield exceeded the highest level in history in 1966. The revolutionary committee of Niugou Township in Xietongmen County led the masses of the entire township to criticize the anti-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in Tibet, who claimed that "the masses do not understand science" and "scientific experiments must be done by experts." They vigorously promoted high-yielding barley varieties selected by the masses and proven through trials. As a result, the yield per unit area of fields sown with this superior variety increased by 44% compared to 1966 before the use of improved seeds.

Currently, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of emancipated peasants in the Shigatse region are enthusiastically carrying Chairman Mao's portrait and holding Chairman Mao's quotations, beating drums and gongs, and selling their new grain to the state.

    新华社日喀则二日电  西藏日喀则地区广大藏族翻身农民坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想战胜重重困难，夺得了西藏民主改革后的第十个丰收年。
    今年，日喀则地区的日喀则、江孜、白朗、仁布、谢通门、萨迦、亚东等十七个农业县的一百一十多万亩土地上，青稞、小麦、豌豆等各种粮食作物，由于单位面积产量增加和播种面积扩大，总产量增长百分之八十四。日喀则地区广大藏族翻身农民热烈欢呼，这是无产阶级文化大革命在西藏高原上的丰硕成果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    日喀则地区广大藏族翻身农民，在人民解放军的帮助下，以毛泽东思想为武器，指导革命，统帅生产。各县的藏族农民大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，坚持活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和毛主席的一系列最新指示，促进人的思想革命化。全区成年人基本上都参加过毛泽东思想学习班的学习。在学习班里，广大翻身农民在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在西藏的代理人周仁山、王其梅，以及没有改造好的农奴主、农奴主代理人等一小撮阶级敌人，展开了大揭发，大批判，大斗争。革命的大批判，大大提高了广大翻身农民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们生产干劲越来越大，为革命种田的思想进一步深入人心，为夺取第十个丰收年打下了良好的思想基础。
    日喀则地区广大翻身农民，遵照毛主席“农业学大寨”的教导，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，向生产的深度和广度进军。今春以来，广大农民新修整修水渠一万三千多条、水塘四千五百多个，扩大灌溉面积近两万亩。仁布县德吉岭、仁布两区的翻身农民，以大寨为榜样，今年开垦荒地一万四千多亩，改良土壤五万七千多亩。位于世界屋脊的亚东帕里镇，今年遇到少有的大雪，积雪达七十多厘米深。在严重的雪灾面前，帕里镇翻身农民，遵照毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，在当地驻军的协助下，冒着刺骨寒风，挖开厚厚的积雪，进行抢挖、抢收、抢运、抢打，仍然获得了好收成，产量比去年大幅度增加。被称为西藏粮仓的年楚河畔的江孜、日喀则县，翻身农民在各级革命委员会的领导下，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，战胜了洪涝灾害，今年粮食总产量超过了历史上获得最大丰收的一九六六年的水平。谢通门县牛古乡革命委员会，领导全乡群众批判了党内最大走资派刘少奇及其在西藏的代理人所散布的“群众不懂科学”、“科学实验要靠专家搞”的反革命修正主义谬论后，大力推广群众自选的、经过试种证明是高产的青稞优良品种。结果用这种优良品种播种的田，单位面积产量比使用良种前的一九六六年增长百分之四十四。
    目前，日喀则地区广大翻身农民在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，纷纷抬着毛主席画像，扛着毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓地向国家交售新粮。
