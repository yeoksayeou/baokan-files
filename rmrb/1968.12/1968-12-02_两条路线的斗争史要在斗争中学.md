The history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party must be learned through struggle. Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us: "A revolutionary party and revolutionary people must undergo repeated education from both the positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, in order to be tempered and mature, and to ensure victory." Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to use Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as a weapon, fully utilize Liu Shaoqi as a negative example, and launch a more extensive and in-depth new wave of revolutionary criticism. We must thoroughly expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, eliminating its poisonous influence. Through criticism, we must seriously study the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, draw lessons, and raise our consciousness in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party must be learned through struggle. The philosophy of the proletariat is a philosophy of struggle. Only revolutionary fighters who bravely throw themselves into the struggle between the two lines can forge a loyal heart to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and master the skills to oppose the revisionist line. If we separate the learning of the history of the struggle between the two lines from the actual struggle between the two lines, it will be empty and abstract, and we will not achieve the goal of raising our consciousness of the struggle between the two lines.

The history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party must also be learned through reform. Reforming literature and arts, education, and all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, and fighting the battle of struggle, criticism, and reform, is the key to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is also the fundamental condition to ensure that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is implemented. We must learn the historical experience of the Party's struggle between the two lines in the process of struggle, criticism, and reform, learning as we reform, so that we can learn deeply and thoroughly, and reform thoroughly and effectively.

In the history of our Party, from 1942 to 1944, the movement to study the struggle between the two lines within the Party consolidated and strengthened the Party's unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, further establishing the dominant position of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Now, the unprecedented movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines that is sweeping the nation will certainly become a powerful force for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It will certainly ensure that the proletariat achieves dominance in ideology.

    两条路线的斗争史要在斗争中学

    学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，要在批判中学。毛主席反复教导我们：“革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。”因此，我们要抓紧战机，以毛主席的革命路线为武器，充分利用刘少奇这个反面教员，掀起更大规模的、更加深入的革命大批判新高潮，进一步把刘少奇及其反革命修正主义路线彻底批臭、批透，肃清它的流毒。在批判中认真地学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，吸取教训，提高我们执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性。
    学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，要在斗争中学。无产阶级的哲学，是斗争的哲学。只有勇敢地投身到两条路线斗争的激流中去的革命战士，才能锤炼出保卫毛主席革命路线的耿耿忠心，才能掌握反对修正主义路线的本领。如果离开两条路线斗争的现实，孤立地学习两条路线的斗争历史，那就是空洞的、抽象的学习，不可能达到提高两条路线斗争觉悟的目的。
    学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，还要在改革中学。改革文艺，改革教育，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，打好斗、批、改这一仗，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键，也是保证毛主席的无产阶级革命路线得到贯彻的根本条件。我们要在斗、批、改的过程中，认真学习党的两条路线斗争的历史经验，边改边学，才能学得深，学得透，也才能改得好，改得彻底。
    在我党历史上，一九四二年至一九四四年间党的两条路线的学习运动，巩固和加强了党在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想基础上的统一，进一步确定了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的统治地位。现在，正在全国蓬勃开展的这场规模空前的两条路线斗争史的学习运动，必将成为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的强大动力，必将使无产阶级在思想上进一步取得统治地位。
