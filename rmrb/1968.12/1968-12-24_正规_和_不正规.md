Title: "Regular" and "Irregular"

One day, several of us parents got together and discussed the matter of "public primary schools being transferred to the brigade for management." Some parents worriedly asked me, "Old He, now that public primary schools have all been changed to privately run schools, the children work one day and do propaganda the next. It doesn't look like a 'regular' school. How can they learn anything like this?!"

I said, this depends on what we mean by "regular" and what we mean by "irregular." Let's take my two children as examples. My eldest son, He Jin, is in the sixth grade at a public primary school, and my daughter, Su Qin, attends a privately run primary school. They are completely different! He Jin loved labor when he was young. Even before he could reach the handle of a hoe, he would follow me to work. Later on, he wouldn't even go to the production team to herd sheep, saying it would interfere with his studies and he might not graduate. As a result, he became a "bookworm" who couldn't carry a load or lift a basket. This kind of "regular" education led a good child down the capitalist road. Su Qin is different. After school, she either helps her mother take care of the children or goes to the team to do propaganda. She is also the tutor for our family's study group. One day, after we had just finished dinner, she heard a whistle outside and put down her chopsticks and left. I asked her, "What's the rush?" She said she was going to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directives. She didn't return until almost midnight. Because I was also late returning from a meeting at the school, I deliberately asked her, "What? Propagating Chairman Mao's latest directives, you didn't even eat dinner?" Su Qin spoke like popping beans, answering me, "The poor and lower-middle peasants taught us that Chairman Mao's words are all truths. We must enthusiastically propagate, defend to the death, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's directives. If I go late, it means I am disloyal to Chairman Mao, it means I have let down the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and it means many uncles and aunts in the mountain valleys won't be able to hear Chairman Mao's voice in time. Although I didn't eat a meal, with the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directives, I didn't feel hungry." Little Su Qin's actions deeply moved me.

The older comrades nodded in agreement, saying, "We don't want that kind of 'regular' education. That's the 'regular' education of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi. His black heart is to use that method to lead our children down the revisionist black road, to put our power into his hands." I continued, "Chairman Mao leads us to carry out the education revolution, transferring public primary schools to the brigade for management, establishing the 'regular' education of the proletariat. Only by putting education on the proletarian track can we cultivate our children into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

    “正规”和“不正规”
    一天，我们几个学生家长凑到一起，谈起了关于“公办小学下放到大队来办”这件事。有的家长担心地问我：“老何呀！公办小学这下子都改成了民办，孩子们今天劳动，明天宣传，不象个‘正规’学校样，上那个学能学到啥呀？！”
    我说，这可得看啥叫“正规”，啥叫“不正规”了。就拿我们家的两个孩子来说吧！大小子何金，在公办小学六年级读书，二丫头素琴念的是民办小学。他（她）俩就是不一样！何金小时候很爱劳动，还没有锨把高，就跟着我干活。后来呢？甭说跟我劳动了，就连到生产队拦羊他都不去，说是怕耽误功课，毕不了业。结果，变成了肩不能担担，手不能提篮的“书呆子”。这种“正规”，把个好孩子给“规”到资本主义邪道上去了。素琴就不一样，放学回家，不是替她妈哄孩子，就是到队里去宣传，还是我们家庭学习班的辅导员。有一天，我们刚吃晚饭，她听到外面有口哨声，搁下碗筷就走了。我问她干啥这么急？她说是去宣传毛主席最新指示，快半夜了才回来。我因为在学校里开会回来也晚了，就故意问她：怎么？宣传毛主席最新指示，连饭都不吃啦？素琴说话就象炒豆子似的，回答我说：贫下中农叔叔教育我们，毛主席的话句句是真理，对毛主席的指示要热情宣传、誓死捍卫、坚决照办。我晚去一会儿就是对毛主席的不忠，就辜负了贫下中农的教育，就会使许多山沟小道的叔叔伯伯们不能及时听到毛主席的声音。我虽然一顿饭没吃，可做到了宣传毛主席的指示不过夜，有毛主席最新指示的鼓舞，我不吃饭也没觉得饿。小素琴的行动极大地感动了我。
    老哥几个听我这么一说，连连点头，说：“咱们可不要那个‘正规’，那是大叛徒刘少奇的‘正规’，他的黑心肠就是想用那一套把我们的孩子引到修正主义黑路上去，把咱们的大权归到他手里去。”我接着说：“毛主席领导我们实行教育革命，把公办小学下放给大队来办，立的是无产阶级的‘正规’，只有把教育归到无产阶级轨道上来，才能把孩子培养成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
