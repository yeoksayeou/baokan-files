According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhengzhou on the 28th, the great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly spoken. It's not enough to tell just a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know." After the latest instructions from Chairman Mao and the important editorial "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" published in *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* were transmitted, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Henan Province immediately responded, conducting serious study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the reissued epoch-making brilliant document—*Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China*. They also carried out extensive propaganda among the broad revolutionary masses.

The following is a summary of speeches made by some leading comrades from the revolutionary committees of Henan Province, regions, cities, and counties during their study and discussion sessions:

	An Epoch-Making Brilliance,
	The Great Blueprint for Socialist Revolution

	Comrade Liu Jianxun, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, said: The great leader Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on March 5, 1949, is a brilliant Marxist-Leninist document of epoch-making significance. In the high tide of fully implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studying this brilliant work by Chairman Mao again feels particularly close to our hearts. It is the great blueprint for guiding the in-depth development of the struggle-criticism-transformation movement and a powerful ideological weapon for thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi.

	Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly spoken. It's not enough to tell just a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know." Chairman Mao's extremely important brilliant instruction points out a new task for us. We must repeatedly and deeply conduct education on the struggle between the two lines among the five thousand million revolutionary people of Henan, so that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. This will enable the broad revolutionary masses to more consciously use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and various erroneous tendencies, turning the vast central plains into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings to "continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried style" and to "continue to maintain a style of hard work and self-reliance." We must firmly grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, strengthen the construction of revolutionary committees, do a good job of ideological and stylistic revolution, closely connect with the masses, and build revolutionary committees into vigorous command posts for class struggle that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	Comrade Zhang Chenguo, Chairman of the Nanyang Regional Revolutionary Committee, said: The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind; there is no room for compromise on the issue of line." We have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenum of the Second Session, and we have a clearer understanding that the struggle between the two lines within the Party reflects the class struggle in society. The focus of the struggle is the issue of power. The crux of the struggle is the attitude towards the masses, especially the attitude towards the masses taking the socialist road and carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction. The struggle practice in our Nanyang Region also fully illustrates this point. After the Seventh Plenum of the Second Session, a nationwide land reform movement was launched, but Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Nanyang promoted "peaceful land reform," protecting the rich peasants' economy. In 1955, when the broad peasantry enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and advanced along the path of agricultural cooperativization, they shouted "rush forward," slashing cooperatives; when our country faced temporary economic difficulties due to three consecutive years of natural disasters, they frantically promoted the "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" black goods, attempting to restore capitalism. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanyang, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, followed Chairman Mao's teachings and fought tooth and nail against this handful of capitalist roaders, consolidating the socialist collective economy and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Recalling the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, especially the fierce struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line over the past nineteen years since liberation, makes us love Chairman Mao, love Mao Zedong Thought, and love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more. It makes us feel even more the importance and necessity of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and it strengthens our resolute determination to follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

	Wholeheartedly Relying on the Working Class,
	Is the Consistent Brilliant Thought of the Great Leader Chairman Mao

	Comrade Wang Jiaming, Chairman of the Luoyang Municipal Revolutionary Committee, said: In the struggle within cities, the question of relying on whom and opposing whom has always been a matter of fierce struggle between the two lines within the Party. In his report to the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class." The number one capitalist roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, opposed relying on the working class, and shamelessly shouted about relying on the bourgeoisie and "experts," saying that workers are "unreliable," and so on. The struggle between the two lines is clearly seen in the Luoyang Dongfanghong Tractor Factory. In the year of the Great Leap Forward, 1958, the broad revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Tractor Factory, under the guidance of the general line, broke away from superstitions, liberated their minds, and carried out a technological innovation movement in the factory, breaking away from "foreign dogmas" and "foreign frameworks." They used their boundless wisdom and creativity to achieve 3,400 technological innovations, start production ahead of schedule, and produce a large number of tractors, making a significant contribution to accelerating the mechanization of agriculture in our country. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi stood on the opposite side of the mass movement, poured cold water on it, and said that "technological innovation cannot be innovated every day, and you still need to sleep." At his instigation, a handful of capitalist roaders in the tractor factory maliciously slandered the workers' innovation movement as "subjectivism," and almost all the technological innovation projects were cut down, restoring "foreign frameworks" and "foreign dogmas," which seriously affected the production of tractors.

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary workers of the tractor factory seized power from the capitalist roaders and occupied the technological front, solving many "old difficult" problems that the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" had not been able to solve for many years in a short period of time. The daily production of tractors far exceeded the design level of the factory, setting a new record since the factory was built.

	Arming the Broad Revolutionary Masses with Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line,
	Is the Fundamental Guarantee for Anti-Revisionism and Preventing Revisionism

	Comrade Zhang Qingli, Chairman of the Lankao County Revolutionary Committee, said: After studying Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, I felt particularly deeply moved. Over the past decade since liberation, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi have been in extremely fierce struggle. Especially in the past two years of the Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines has been even more intense. In the struggle between the two lines, we have paid great attention to letting the broad revolutionary masses grasp Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forming an invincible revolutionary force. In last year's "February Countercurrent," our county had a batch of proletarian revolutionaries who suffered brutal persecution from the bourgeois reactionary line. However, we firmly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and achieved victory.

	To enable the broad revolutionary masses to directly grasp Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we held tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes from the county, commune, to the production brigade and production team. Over 260,000 people in the county regularly participate in the study. The result of arming the members with Mao Zedong Thought is that the revolution and production in the whole county are booming. This year, the total grain output in Lankao County increased by one-fourth compared to last year. We deeply feel from the practice of revolutionary struggle that arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, handing over Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the masses, and firmly believing in the masses is the fundamental guarantee for the proletarian revolutionary cause to stand unshakable.

    把革委会建成永远忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗指挥部
    河南省、地、市、县革委会成员学习两条路线斗争历史的座谈纪要
    据新华社郑州二十八日电　伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席的这一最新指示和传达毛主席这一最新指示的《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》发表后，河南省各级革命委员会闻风而动，对毛主席的最新指示和重新发表的划时代的光辉文献——《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，立即进行认真学习，并向广大革命群众深入宣传。
    下面是河南省省、地、市、县革命委员会部分负责同志学习、座谈时的发言纪要：
    划时代的光辉文献，
    指导社会主义革命的伟大纲领
    河南省革命委员会主任刘建勋同志说：伟大领袖毛主席一九四九年三月五日《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，是一个具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义光辉文献。在全面落实党的八届十二中全会公报，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的高潮中，重新学习毛主席的这篇光辉著作，感到特别亲切。它是指导斗、批、改运动深入发展的伟大纲领，是彻底批判刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的强大思想武器。
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席的这一极其重要的光辉指示，给我们指出了新的任务，我们要在河南五千万革命人民中反复地、深入地进行两条路线斗争的教育，让毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为广大革命群众所掌握，使广大革命群众更加自觉地运用毛泽东思想这一强大思想武器，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线和各种错误倾向，把辽阔中原办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    我们要牢记毛主席的教导，“继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”，“继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”。要狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，加强革委会的建设，搞好思想革命化和作风革命化，密切联系群众，把革委会建设成无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的、朝气蓬勃的阶级斗争指挥部。
    南阳地区革命委员会主任张成国同志说：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”我们反复学习毛主席的教导和毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，更加清楚地认识到，党内两条路线的斗争，反映了社会上的阶级斗争。斗争的中心，是政权问题。斗争的焦点，是对待群众的态度问题，特别是对待群众走社会主义道路，搞社会主义革命和社会主义建设的态度问题。我们南阳地区的斗争实践，也充分说明了这一点。党的七届二中全会之后，全国掀起了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，而刘少奇及其在南阳地区的代理人却搞什么“和平土改”，保护富农经济；一九五五年，当广大农民热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，沿着农业合作化的道路奋勇前进的时刻，他们大喊“冒进”，大砍合作社；当我国由于连续三年遭受自然灾害而经济发生暂时困难时期，他们又疯狂推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”的黑货，妄图复辟资本主义。无限忠于毛主席的南阳地区广大贫下中农，遵照毛主席的教导，同这一小撮走资派进行了针锋相对的斗争，巩固了社会主义集体经济，保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    回忆党内两条路线斗争的历史，特别是解放十九年来，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线的激烈斗争，使我们更加热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想、热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更加感到毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的重要性和必要性，更加激发了我们紧跟毛主席革命到底的坚强决心。全心全意地依靠工人阶级，
    是伟大领袖毛主席一贯的光辉思想
    洛阳市革命委员会主任王甲军同志说：在城市斗争中，依靠谁，反对谁，党内历来就存在着两条路线的激烈斗争。毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告中明确指出：“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。党内头号走资派刘少奇疯狂反对毛主席的革命路线，反对依靠工人阶级，丧心病狂地大喊依靠资产阶级、依靠“专家”，胡说什么工人“靠不住”等等。两条路线的斗争，在洛阳东方红拖拉机厂看得非常清楚。在大跃进的一九五八年，东方红拖拉机厂的广大革命工人，在总路线的指引下，破除迷信，解放思想，大破“洋教条”、“洋框框”，用自己的无穷智慧和创造才能，在工厂里开展了技术革新运动，实现了三千四百多项技术革新，提前开工生产，生产出了大批拖拉机，为加速我国农业机械化作出了贡献。大工贼刘少奇站在群众运动的对面，大泼冷水，胡说什么“技术革新不能天天革，还要睡觉”。在他的唆使下，拖拉机厂的一小撮走资派大肆诬蔑工人的革新运动是“唯心主义”等等，把几千个技术革新项目几乎全部砍掉，恢复了“洋框框”、“洋教条”，结果严重地影响了拖拉机的生产。
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，拖拉机厂的广大革命职工夺了走资派的权，占领了技术阵地，很短的时间内，解决了资产阶级“专家”、“权威”们多年来解决不了的很多“老大难”问题，拖拉机日产量大大超过了这个厂的设计水平，出现了建厂以来的最高纪录。
    用毛主席的革命路线武装广大革命
    群众，是反修防修的根本保证
    兰考县革命委员会主任张钦礼同志说：学习了毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席的最新指示，感受特别深刻。解放十几年来，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，一直进行着极其激烈的斗争。特别是在两年多来的文化大革命中，两条路线的斗争更为剧烈。在两条路线的搏斗中，我们非常注意让广大革命群众掌握毛主席革命路线，形成一支战无不胜的革命队伍。在去年的“二月逆流”中，我们县有一批无产阶级革命派，遭受到资产阶级反动路线的残酷迫害。但是，我们坚决保卫了毛主席的革命路线，夺得了胜利。
    为了使广大革命群众直接掌握毛主席的革命路线，我们从县、公社到大队、生产队，举办了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，全县有二十六万多人经常参加学习。用毛泽东思想武装社员的结果，全县革命和生产都搞得轰轰烈烈。今年兰考县的粮食总产量比去年增加了四分之一。我们从革命斗争实践中深深体会到，用毛泽东思想武装群众，把毛主席的革命路线交给群众，坚定不移地相信群众，这是使无产阶级革命事业永远立于不败之地的根本保证。
