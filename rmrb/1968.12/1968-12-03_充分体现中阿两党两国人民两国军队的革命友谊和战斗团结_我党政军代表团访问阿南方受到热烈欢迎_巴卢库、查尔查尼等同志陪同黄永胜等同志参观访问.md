The Chinese party, government, and military delegation, led by CPC Central Committee member and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrade Huang Yongsheng, visited the southern regions of Albania, namely the Fier and Berat districts, from November 30 to December 1. They received an extremely warm and enthusiastic welcome from the party and government leaders, military leaders, workers, agricultural cooperative members, and soldiers of these two districts. This visit once again fully demonstrated the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the two parties, the two peoples, and the two armies.

Comrades accompanying the delegation on their visit to the Fier district included: Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Vice-Premier of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Defense, Beqir Balluku; Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Vice-Premier of the Council of Ministers, Adil Çarçani; Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Albania-China Friendship Association, Ali Kelmendi; Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army, Petrit Dume; Member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Director of the Political Department of the People's Army, Hysni Çako; and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Reiz Malile.

On the morning of November 30, as the delegation's car left Tirana for Fier, workers on their way to work, agricultural cooperative members in the fields, armed soldiers and militiamen all gathered along the roadside to warmly welcome the Chinese comrades. That day, the cities of Kavaja, Durrës, Lushnje, and Fier, through which the delegation passed, were decorated as if for a festival. Red banners hung along the streets, bearing slogans in Albanian and Chinese: "Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!" "Long live Albanian-Chinese friendship!" "Fight to the end against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries!" The center of Kavaja was packed with welcoming crowds. Male and female militiamen performed the collective drill "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun" on the streets. Amateur and professional performers formed choirs and dance troupes to sing and dance joyfully. Children from kindergartens each held an Albanian letter, forming slogans such as "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Workers and agricultural cooperative members in Lushnje and Fier held up portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Chairman Mao, shouting "Enver-Hoxha-Mao" for a long time.

When the delegation's car arrived in the Heroic City of Fier, the entire city was in an uproar. Along the flower-lined avenue by the Adriatic Sea, and on the balconies of houses along the road, crowds gathered, holding up portraits of Comrade Hoxha and Chairman Mao, waving Albanian and Chinese flags, red flags, flowers, and balloons, shouting "Enver-Hoxha-Mao" joyfully. Comrade Huang Yongsheng and the entire delegation held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and warmly greeted the welcoming crowds.

That same evening, the Party Committee of the Fier district and the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of the Fier district held a banquet to welcome the delegation. During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the health of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and to the unbreakable combat friendship between Albania and China.

On December 1, the Chinese party, government, and military delegation visited and inspected the Fier naval base and the Fier soda factory.

When the delegation arrived at a certain unit of the naval base, all the officers and soldiers lined up to welcome the Chinese comrades with sincere combat sentiments. They applauded enthusiastically and repeatedly shouted, "Enver-Hoxha-Mao" and "Long live the brotherly friendship between the armies of the two countries!" The Chinese and Albanian comrades stood shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, and took photos together.

The entire unit held a mass meeting to welcome the Chinese comrades who had forged combat friendships in the common struggle against imperialism and revisionism. At the meeting, Hysni Çako, Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, gave an enthusiastic speech. The comrades from the Chinese party, government, and military delegation also spoke. Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by shouts of "Enver-Hoxha-Mao," "Long live the Albanian People's Army!" and "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" The meeting was filled with deep revolutionary friendship between the two parties, the two peoples, and the two armies of China and Albania.

The Chinese party, government, and military delegation presented embroidered portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha to all the officers and soldiers of this unit.

Next, the delegation visited the soda factory and inspected the factory's workshops, engaging in friendly conversations with the workers.

In the morning of the same day, the delegation left the Fier district and arrived in the city of Berat. The people of the mountain city of Berat blew traditional instruments and danced to welcome the delegation, presenting bouquets of flowers to the Chinese comrades.

Comrades accompanying the delegation on their visit to Berat included: Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Vice-Premier of the Council of Ministers, Adil Çarçani; Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Albania-China Friendship Association, Ali Kelmendi; Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army, Petrit Dume; Member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Director of the Political Department of the People's Army, Hysni Çako; and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Reiz Malile.

When the delegation arrived at the textile mill named after the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the textile workers rushed out to welcome the guests. Chinese engineering and technical personnel working in the mill also joined the welcoming line. Huge portraits of Comrade Hoxha and Chairman Mao, as well as a segment of the telegram sent by Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou to Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu on September 17 this year, were hung on the factory building: "If the US imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only face a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure." The building also displayed a segment of the telegram sent by Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou on September 9 this year: "The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a fatal and heavy blow to the imperialists led by US imperialism, the modern revisionists led by Soviet revisionism, and other reactionaries."

After the delegation inspected the production process, the entire workforce of the Mao Zedong Textile Mill and the people from other parts of the Berat district gathered in the factory square to hold a grand welcoming ceremony. Comrade Pieter Gushov, First Secretary of the Berat District Party Committee, and the comrades from the Chinese party, government, and military delegation spoke at the ceremony. The delegation presented embroidered portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha to the workers of the Mao Zedong Textile Mill. The workers of the Mao Zedong Textile Mill also presented portraits of Comrade Hoxha and Chairman Mao, which they had just woven, to the Chinese delegation.

After the ceremony, the Party Committee of the Berat district and the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of the Berat district held a luncheon for the delegation. The luncheon was filled with the deep combat friendship between the peoples of the two countries.
