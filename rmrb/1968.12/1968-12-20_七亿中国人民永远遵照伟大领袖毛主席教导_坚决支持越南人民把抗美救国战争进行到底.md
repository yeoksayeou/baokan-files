The capital's masses held a grand rally to enthusiastically celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

The rally read the congratulatory telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho. The reading of the telegram was met with thunderous applause from the attendees.

New China News Agency, December 19th: The revolutionary masses of the capital held a grand rally today to enthusiastically celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The rally paid tribute to the people of South Vietnam who are fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle and declared: The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

After the rally began, the band played the song "Liberate the South" of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.

The rally first read the congratulatory telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of its founding. The reading of the telegram was met with thunderous applause from the revolutionary masses of the capital and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

Comrades Xie Fuzhi, Wen Yucheng, and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo attended the celebration rally.

Invited to attend the rally were Comrade Nguyen Van Quyen, head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Ambassador Vu Minh Quan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing.

The central banner on the stage displayed the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, the portrait of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and the portrait of Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The national flag of the People's Republic of China, the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and the national flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were hung at the entrance of the venue. The venue was adorned with quotations from Chairman Mao:

"The seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. In the face of the staunch fighting unity of the peoples of our two countries, any military adventurism and political deception by American imperialism are doomed to failure."

And quotations from Chairman Ho Chi Minh:

"Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We, the Vietnamese people, will resolutely fight until there is not a single shadow of American aggressors on our beloved land."

Vice Chairman Wu De of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee spoke first at the rally. He warmly praised the people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, for persisting in people's war and repeatedly clashing with American imperialism in the great anti-American national salvation war, achieving brilliant victories. He said that the 14 million people of South Vietnam are indeed heroic, and the South Vietnamese Liberation Army is indeed heroic. The great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation war have contributed to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

Wu De pointed out that the war of aggression by American imperialism in Vietnam has greatly deepened its internal political and economic crises. American imperialism is having a harder and harder time. Whether it is the Democratic Party's Johnson administration or the incoming Republican Party's Nixon administration, they are all unable to escape the predicament of internal and external difficulties and have no way out, and they cannot save themselves from the fate of ultimate failure in the Vietnam War.

Wu De said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: 'Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' Currently, American imperialism, in an attempt to reverse its defeat on the battlefield, is stepping up its military adventurism and political deception, implementing a counterrevolutionary two-pronged strategy. The desperate struggles of American imperialism fully demonstrate that its ambition to invade Vietnam will not change. All the means it uses, despite their variations, are aimed at achieving its evil goal of permanently occupying South Vietnam and splitting the Vietnamese nation."

Wu De pointed out that in the war of aggression by American imperialism in Vietnam, the revisionist clique of the Soviet Union has always acted as the number one accomplice of American imperialism. Khrushchev adopted a "withdrawal" policy, allowing American imperialism to invade Vietnam. After the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique came to power, they changed their approach, adopting an "intervention" policy, pretending to support but actually betraying the Vietnamese people, using the Vietnamese issue as an important component of their counterrevolutionary dealings with American imperialism, seeking to mutually collude and compete, and attempting to redivide the world. He said, people around the world are increasingly aware that the revisionist clique of the Soviet Union, like American imperialism, is the most dangerous enemy of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. A new great wave of struggle against American imperialism and Soviet revisionism is rising. The plots of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism to dominate the world are doomed to fail.

He said, despite the difficulties and twists and turns that the Vietnamese people will inevitably encounter on the road to achieving a complete victory in the anti-American national salvation war, as long as they persist in a protracted war and resolutely carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to "for independence and freedom, our 31 million compatriots are determined to overcome all difficulties and make sacrifices to fight to the end and win," they will surely achieve the ultimate victory in the great anti-American national salvation war.

Wu De said, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, has gone through extremely complex and sharp class struggles and has achieved great and decisive victories. The situation is excellent. The Central Cultural Revolution Group has played an important role in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Currently, under the great encouragement of the communique of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, our people are taking revolutionary actions to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's teaching that the working class must lead everything, to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including all cultural fields, to complete the tasks of the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation proposed by Chairman Mao, and to welcome the convening of the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is not far off.

Wu De concluded by saying, our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us: "The people who have already achieved revolutionary victory should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and pledge to be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

Comrade Nguyen Van Quyen then spoke. He cited facts to introduce the brilliant victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation war. He said, with their boundless love for their motherland and deep hatred for the enemy, the 14 million people of South Vietnam united as one to take up arms and rise up in struggle, rapidly developing their national salvation war into a full-scale people's war. Over the past eight years, they have repeatedly foiled all military plans of American imperialism and are now launching continuous offensives to achieve even greater and more comprehensive victories. The past eight years have been eight years of extremely heroic struggle and brilliant victories for the 14 million people of South Vietnam.

Nguyen Van Quyen said, on the international stage, the international prestige of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has been continuously enhanced. Many governments and international organizations have established relations with the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front has set up representative offices in many countries around the world.

Nguyen Van Quyen pointed out that although American imperialism has suffered serious defeats, it still refuses to give up its aggressive ambitions and is intensifying its war of aggression. He said, it is the inalienable right of the people of South Vietnam to resist American aggressors. As long as American imperialism continues to invade South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam will continue to fight until they achieve final victory. No matter how stubborn and cunning American imperialism is, its fate of suffering a thorough defeat in the war of aggression against South Vietnam and the fate of the complete collapse of the puppet regime of American imperialism are inevitable. The anti-American national salvation cause led by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will surely achieve victory.

In his speech, Nguyen Van Quyen warmly praised the fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. He said, the Vietnamese people have always received the sincere support of the fraternal Chinese people in their struggle; the Communist Party of China, the government, and the fraternal Chinese people not only support the revolutionary line of struggle of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam but also provide extremely great and effective material assistance to the anti-American national salvation struggle of the people of South Vietnam.

He said, the great leader of the Chinese people and the dear friend of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Mao, said in his congratulatory telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on December 19, 1967: "We firmly support you. Our two countries are neighboring countries that depend on each other. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. The brothers of South Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people can believe that your struggle is our struggle. The seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." Today, in the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou once again affirmed: "The seven hundred million Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end."

He said, the sincere support of the Chinese people has strengthened the anti-American national salvation cause of the people of South Vietnam and has inspired the people of South Vietnam to advance and deal heavy blows to the American aggressors, achieving increasingly great and comprehensive victories. The people of South Vietnam highly appreciate this support and believe that every victory they achieve is inseparable from the sincere support of the fraternal Chinese people. On this occasion, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and all the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, once again express our heartfelt thanks to the dear Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the government, and the fraternal Chinese people.

He said, the people of South Vietnam have always been concerned about the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people and are very happy about the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people in their glorious revolutionary cause. The people of South Vietnam sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater victories in their socialist construction and wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao a comprehensive victory.

Nguyen Van Quyen said, the failure of American imperialism is already obvious, but it is still stubborn and refuses to give up its ambition to invade South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Ho and the call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, determined to unite with their 17 million compatriots in the north, persist in the struggle, and implement Chairman Ho's teaching: "As long as there is still an aggressor on our land, we will continue to fight and drive them all out." The military and civilian people of South Vietnam are determined to defeat the war of aggression by American imperialism, overthrow the traitorous clique, seize all power back into the hands of the people, and gloriously fulfill the sacred mission of liberating the south, defending the north, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland, contributing to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

After the speeches, the entire audience stood up and shouted slogans: "Resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end!" "Long live the brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "The Vietnamese people will win! American imperialism will be defeated!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with all reactionaries in the world!" "Thoroughly smash the plots of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism to dominate the world!" "Resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world!" "Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho!" "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!"

The rally ended with the singing of the "Internationale."

The celebration rally was jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association. Vice Chairman Ding Xilin of the China International Friendship Association and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association presided over the rally. Responsible comrades from the People's Liberation Army and relevant departments, representatives of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital, representatives of the five good soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, representatives of the workers' congress, peasants' congress, red guards of universities and colleges, and red guards of middle schools in Beijing attended the rally.

    新华社十九日讯　首都革命群众今天隆重集会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年。大会向战斗在反美斗争最前线的越南南方人民致敬，并且表示：经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，永远遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    庆祝大会开始后，乐队高奏越南南方民族解放阵线歌曲《解放南方》和中华人民共和国国歌。
    大会首先宣读了我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来总理，为祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年，给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的贺电。宣读贺电时，参加大会的首都革命群众和中国人民解放军指战员发出一阵阵雷鸣般的热烈掌声。
    谢富治同志、温玉成同志、郭沫若副委员长等，出席了庆祝大会。
    应邀出席大会的，有越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾，以及在北京的其他越南同志。
    大会主席台正中的帷幕上，挂着我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，挂着越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的画像和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的画像。中华人民共和国国旗，越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜和越南民主共和国国旗，悬挂在会场入口处。会场上挂着毛主席语录：
    “七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。在我们两国人民坚强的战斗团结面前，美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。”
    挂着胡志明主席语录：
    “炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”
    北京市革命委员会副主任吴德同志在大会上首先讲话。他热烈赞扬越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，在伟大的抗美救国战争中，坚持人民战争，同美帝国主义进行了反复的较量，取得了辉煌的胜利。他说，一千四百万越南南方人民不愧为英雄的人民，越南南方解放军不愧为英雄的军队。越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中取得的伟大胜利，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争作出了贡献。
    吴德指出，美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，大大加深了它国内政治、经济上的严重危机。美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过。不管是民主党的约翰逊政府，还是将要上台的共和党的尼克松政府，他们都无法摆脱内外交困、走投无路的处境，都挽救不了他们在侵越战争中最后失败的命运。
    吴德说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”目前，美帝国主义为了妄图扭转它在战场上的败局，正在加紧推行它的军事冒险和政治欺骗的反革命两手策略。美帝国主义的垂死挣扎，充分说明它侵略越南的野心是决不会改变的。它所使用的种种手段，万变不离其宗，都是为了达到它永远霸占越南南方、分割越南民族的罪恶目的。
    吴德指出，在美帝国主义侵略越南的战争中，苏修叛徒集团一直充当美帝国主义的头号帮凶。赫鲁晓夫采取“脱身”政策，纵容美帝侵略越南。勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团上台后，他们改变做法，采取“插手”政策，对越南人民假支持、真出卖，把越南问题作为它同美帝国主义互相勾结、互相争夺、妄图重新瓜分世界的反革命交易的一项重要内容。他说，全世界人民愈来愈清楚地认识到：苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义一样，是越南人民和世界人民最危险的敌人。一个全世界人民反对美帝和苏修的新的伟大的斗争高潮，正在兴起。美帝和苏修妄图霸占世界的阴谋，是注定要破产的。
    他说，越南人民在争取抗美救国战争彻底胜利的征途上，尽管还会遇到这样那样的困难和曲折，但是，只要坚持持久战争，坚决实现胡志明主席提出的“为了独立和自由，我国三千一百万同胞决心克服一切困难，不惜牺牲，决战决胜”的伟大号召，一定能够赢得伟大的抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    吴德说，我国无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，经过极其复杂、极其尖锐的阶级斗争，已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。形势一片大好。中央文革在贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的斗争中，起了重要的作用。目前，我国人民在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，正在以革命的实际行动，坚决执行毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的教导，实现无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政，实现毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，迎接中国共产党第九次全国代表大会的召开。我国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，已经为期不远了。
    吴德最后说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席一贯教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民将永远遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    阮文广团长接着讲话。他列举事实，介绍了越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，在抗美救国战争中不断取得的辉煌胜利。他说，越南南方人民怀着对祖国的无比热爱和对敌人的无比仇恨，万众一心地拿起武器奋起斗争，把自己的救国抗战事业迅速发展为一场全民、全面的人民战争，八年来，连续地粉碎了美帝国主义的一切军事计划，接着又为夺取更巨大和全面的胜利开展了连续的进攻。过去的八年，是越南南方一千四百万人民进行无比英勇的战斗和取得辉煌胜利的八年。
    阮文广说，在国际舞台上，越南南方民族解放阵线的国际威望不断提高。许多国家的政府和国际组织已和越南南方民族解放阵线建立了关系。民族解放阵线在世界上许多国家设立了代表机构。
    阮文广指出，美帝国主义虽然遭到严重失败，但它仍然不肯放弃侵略野心，正在强化侵略战争。他说，越南南方人民抗击美国侵略者是自己不可侵犯的权利。只要美帝国主义还侵略越南南方，越南南方人民就继续进行战斗，直到取得最后胜利。不管美帝国主义如何顽固和狡猾，他们在侵略越南南方的战争中遭到彻底失败的命运和美帝的走狗伪政权彻底崩溃的命运，是不可避免的。越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下所进行的抗美救国事业，必然取得胜利。
    阮文广在讲话中热烈称赞越中两国人民的战斗友谊。他说，越南人民在自己的斗争事业中向来得到兄弟的中国人民一贯的真诚支持；中国共产党、政府和兄弟的中国人民不仅支持越南南方民族解放阵线的革命斗争路线，而且在物质方面给予了越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争以非常巨大和有效的援助。
    他说，中国人民的伟大领袖、越南人民敬爱的朋友毛主席于一九六七年十二月十九日在给阮友寿主席的贺电中曾经说过：“我们坚决支持你们。我们两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”敬爱的毛主席、林副主席和周总理，今天在向阮友寿主席祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年的贺电中再一次肯定：“七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底”。
    他说，中国人民的真挚支援，使越南南方人民的抗美救国事业增加了力量，并且鼓舞着越南南方人民向前挺进，给予美国侵略者以猛烈的打击，夺取日益巨大和全面的胜利。越南南方人民高度评价这种支援，并认为自己的每一个胜利都是和兄弟的中国人民的真诚支援分不开的。借此机会，我代表越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和全体越南南方军民，向敬爱的毛主席、中国共产党、政府和兄弟的中国人民，再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    他说，越南南方人民一向关心中国人民的革命斗争，并为中国人民在光荣的革命事业中取得的辉煌胜利感到非常高兴。越南南方人民衷心祝贺兄弟的中国人民在自己的社会主义建设事业中取得更加巨大的胜利，祝毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利。
    阮文广说，美帝国主义的失败已是很明显的了，但仍然很顽固，仍然不肯放弃侵略越南南方的野心。越南南方人民热烈响应胡主席的号召和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的号召，决心同自己的一千七百万北方骨肉同胞团结一心，坚持战斗，实现胡主席的教导：“只要在我国土地上还有一个侵略者，我们就要继续战斗，把它全部赶出去。”越南南方军民决心打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，打倒越奸卖国集团，把全部政权夺回到人民手里，光荣地完成解放南方、保卫北方、进而和平统一祖国的神圣义务，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。
    讲话以后，全场起立，高呼口号：“坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！”“中越两国人民的兄弟友谊和战斗团结万岁！”“越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒各国反动派！”“彻底粉碎美帝、苏修妄图霸占世界的阴谋！”“坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”“越南人民的伟大领袖胡主席万岁！”“中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    大会在高昂的《国际歌》声中结束。
    庆祝大会是由北京市革命委员会和中越友协举办的。对外友协副会长、中越友协理事丁西林主持大会。中国人民解放军和有关方面的负责人李天佑、韩念龙，首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队代表，中国人民解放军驻北京部队五好战士代表，北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会和中学红代会的代表，出席了大会。
