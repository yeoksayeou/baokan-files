The revolutionary workers of Shanghai Towel Factory No. 9, the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station, and some retail stores have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly." They have conducted joint investigations and research, carried out revolutionary criticism, and reformed unreasonable regulations and systems. This has greatly enriched the content of the struggle, criticism, and transformation. A new type of socialist industrial and commercial relationship has been established, and industrial production and commercial procurement and sales have presented a new revolutionary scene.

The great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on "fully mobilizing the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work" and the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in Shanghai Towel Factory No. 9. The entire factory has quickly launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The workers, with a revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to practice, have exposed and denounced the various frameworks set up by the great traitor, great internal spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi in his implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line, as well as the unreasonable regulations and systems that shackle the development of productive forces. They have put forward many suggestions for reform. The revolutionary workers of the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station, who are participating in labor at this factory, have been deeply educated. They realized that many of the problems exposed by the workers are related to the commercial sector. At the suggestion of the workers, the revolutionary committees of Shanghai Towel Factory No. 9 and the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station conducted a study and decided to jointly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

First, they conducted joint investigations and research. They held workers' meetings in the workshops, went to the countryside to solicit the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants, and went to the stores to listen to the reflections of the sales staff, understanding the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Through a series of investigations, they discovered many problems. For example: the broad masses of workers and peasants urgently need the factory's production of "414" striped towels, but the factory produces very few of them. On the contrary, it produces many high-grade printed towels. In the pricing of products between industry and commerce, there are sometimes disputes over profits. In the procurement, inspection, receipt, and payment links of commerce, there are also some unreasonable regulations and systems that hinder the development of production. Both sides realized that these problems are essentially about whether to highlight proletarian politics or simply focus on business; whether to face workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve the proletariat or face a few people and serve the bourgeoisie; whether to trust the working class or trust the bourgeois "experts"; in industrial and commercial relations, whether it is a socialist division of labor and cooperation or a capitalist buyer-seller relationship. These are fundamental issues of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and are the result of the great traitor, great internal spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line and business line in the industrial and commercial sectors, and their poison must be thoroughly eliminated.

Having grasped the essence of the problems, they took the factory as the base and the workers as the main body to carry out revolutionary criticism. The relevant procurement and supply personnel and revolutionary cadres of the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station all went to the factory to participate in the criticism. Since the sales staff of the retail stores are in close contact with workers, peasants, and soldiers and understand the situation more, they invited some sales staff from the department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in the city and suburbs to form a joint fighting team of production, supply, and sales. They also brought a handful of bad elements from the industrial and commercial departments, such as the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," to the meeting as living teaching materials. From the perspectives of production, supply, and sales, they severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents, focusing on criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "profit-first" and "target-first" black goods; criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents' fallacies of serving the bourgeoisie; and the fallacies of establishing an opposing side by "controlling" and "restricting" the industrial sector under the influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the commercial sector. Through the criticism, the comrades of the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station reviewed the past harm caused by Liu Shaoqi and his agents' "control" and "restriction" of the factory to production. The workers of Towel Factory No. 9, in severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "profit-first" and "target-first" black goods, exposed and criticized the past crimes of the capitalist-roaders in their department in arranging production by simply pursuing profits and production value indicators, without arranging the production of towels with low production value and low profits but needed by workers, peasants, and soldiers. As the criticism deepened, the broad revolutionary workers clearly saw that the past constant disputes between industry and commerce, causing estrangement, were due to Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line at work. Liu Shaoqi is the chief culprit in disrupting industrial and commercial relations.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the main task, construction is also included." Through revolutionary criticism, the workers, sales staff, and revolutionary workers of the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station have greatly raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. On the basis of a unified understanding, they quickly broke through the revisionist frameworks and reformed unreasonable regulations and systems. For example, in the past, the factory and the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station's bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" pursued superficial beauty, changing the white base yarn of the colored stripes part of the "414" towels to colored base yarn, reducing the strength of the towels. Now it has been changed back, restoring the original strength. In the past, for the sake of formal beauty, the factory name or product name was stamped on both ends of the towels. Now the factory name and product name are placed together and printed on one end, saving manpower. Through the reform, it is initially estimated that the factory can save 6,200 man-days and 60,000 yuan in labor and material costs per year. The revolution has promoted production. The output of Towel Factory No. 9 in November this year increased by more than 60% compared to the same period last year, creating a new record never seen in history. The "414" towels needed by workers, peasants, and soldiers have also increased significantly. The revolutionary workers of the Cotton Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station have been greatly educated in the process of jointly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with the revolutionary workers of Towel Factory No. 9. They actively supported the workers' reasonable suggestions and promptly reformed some unreasonable regulations and systems that shackled industrial production. In the past, this station's warehouse did not accept goods on Sundays and holidays. Now, personnel are arranged to be on duty, accepting goods as usual; in the past, emphasis was placed on supervision, and each batch of products from the factory had to be inspected and stamped by this station before it could be shipped. Now it is changed to self-inspection by the factory, and commercial personnel go to the factory with the workers to study together and help improve the quality. To ensure that the factory receives payment promptly after delivery, this station has also set up payment points at the wharf and warehouse. This has facilitated the factory and accelerated the turnover of goods. On the basis of continuously increasing industrial production, the total value of goods procured by this station in November increased by 60% compared to the same period last year, strongly supporting the autumn peak season market supply in various places.

The revolutionary workers of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, with the help of the PLA soldiers stationed in the factory, have carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly. They organized a part-time investigation team of workers, conducting investigations, criticism, and reform simultaneously. This is a member of the workers' part-time investigation team reporting the investigation report to the workshop workers.

    产供销部门三结合搞好斗批改
    上海毛巾九厂、针棉织品采购供应站和部分零售商店革命职工，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的教导，一道调查研究，一道开展革命大批判，一道改革不合理的规章制度，大大丰富了斗、批、改的内容，建立起新型的社会主义工商关系，工业生产、商业购销出现崭新的景象。
    本报讯　上海毛巾九厂和上海针棉织品采购供应站以及一部分零售商店的革命职工，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的教导，采取产、供、销三结合的形式，一道调查研究，一道开展革命大批判，一道改革不合理的规章制度，大大丰富了斗、批、改的内容，工、商双方在共同的战斗中，加强了革命团结，建立起新型的社会主义工商关系，工业生产、商业购销都出现崭新的革命景象。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”等一系列最新指示，以及党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，极大地鼓舞了上海毛巾九厂广大工人的革命积极性，全厂迅速掀起一个斗、批、改的新高潮。工人们以敢于斗争、敢于实践的革命气概，揭发和控诉了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇推行反革命修正主义企业管理路线设下的条条框框，以及束缚生产力发展的不合理规章制度，提出了许多改革的意见。正在这个厂参加劳动的上海针棉织品采购供应站的革命职工受到深刻教育。他们意识到，工人同志揭发的许多问题，有不少和商业部门有关。在工人们的提议下，上海毛巾九厂和针棉织品采购供应站革命委员会经过研究，决定工、商联合一道来搞斗、批、改。
    首先，他们联合起来进行调查研究，在车间召开工人座谈会，下农村征求贫下中农意见，到商店听取营业员反映，了解工农兵的需要。他们通过一系列调查，发现了很多问题。例如：广大工农群众很需要这个厂生产的彩条“414”毛巾，而厂里却很少生产，相反搞了很多高档的印花毛巾。工商之间在产品订价上，有时为争利润扯皮不休。在商业的采购、检验、收货、付款等环节中，也存在着一些不合理的规章制度，阻碍了生产的发展。工商双方一致认识到，这些问题实质上是突出无产阶级政治还是单纯抓业务；是面向工农兵、为无产阶级服务还是面向少数人、为资产阶级服务；是相信工人阶级还是相信资产阶级“专家”；在工商关系上，是社会主义的分工协作关系还是资本主义的你卖我买的问题。这些都是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的原则问题，是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在工商部门推行反革命修正主义企业管理路线和经营路线的结果，必须彻底肃清其流毒。
    抓住了问题的本质，他们就以工厂为基地，工人为主体，开展革命的大批判。针棉织品采购供应站的有关采购员、供应员和革命干部都下厂参加大批判。由于零售商店的营业员与工农兵接触密切，情况了解较多，他们邀请了市区和郊县的一部分百货店、供销社的营业员，组成了产、供、销三结合的战斗队伍，并把工商部门的走资派、资产阶级反动技术“权威”等一小撮坏蛋揪到会场作为活教材，从产、供、销不同角度狠批大叛徒刘少奇及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，着重批判刘少奇的“利润挂帅”、“指标第一”等黑货；批判刘少奇及其代理人鼓吹的为资产阶级服务的谬论；以及在刘少奇反革命修正主义路线影响下，商业部门“管”、“卡”工业部门的所谓树立对立面的谬论。通过批判，针棉织品采购供应站的同志清算了过去刘少奇及其代理人对工厂实行“管”、“卡”给生产带来的恶果。毛巾九厂的工人在狠批刘少奇的“利润挂帅”、“指标第一”等黑货时，揭发批判了过去本部门走资派布置生产过程中单纯追求利润和产值指标，对一些产值低、利润少，而工农兵需要的毛巾不安排生产的罪行。随着大批判的深入，广大革命职工清楚地看到，工商之间过去老是扯皮，造成隔阂，就是刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线在作怪。刘少奇是破坏工商关系的罪魁祸首。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”通过革命的大批判，工人、营业员和针棉织品采购供应站的革命职工都大大提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。在认识一致的基础上，他们迅速冲破修正主义的条条框框，改革了不合理的规章制度。例如过去这个厂和针棉织品采购供应站的资产阶级反动技术“权威”单纯追求表面美观，将“414”毛巾的彩条部分白色底纱改为颜色底纱，使毛巾强力降低，现在已把它改回来，恢复了原有的牢度。过去为了形式上的美观，毛巾两头都盖上厂名或品名的木印，现在把厂名、品名放在一起，改为印一头，就节省了人力。通过改革，初步估计这个厂全年可以节约六千二百个劳动日，六万元工料费。革命推动了生产。毛巾九厂今年十一月份的产量比去年同期增加百分之六十以上，开创了历史上从未有过的新纪录。工农兵需要的“414”毛巾更是大幅度增加。针棉织品采购供应站的革命职工在和毛巾九厂革命职工一道搞斗、批、改的过程中受到很大教育。他们积极支持工人的合理建议，及时改革了一些束缚工业生产的不合理规章制度。过去这个站的仓库星期日、假日不收货，现在安排人员值班，照常收货；过去片面强调监督，工厂每批产品都要经这个站检验盖章才能出厂，现在改为由工厂自行检验出厂，商业人员下厂与工人一起研究，帮助提高质量。为使工厂送货后及时收款，这个站又在码头、仓库增设了付款点。这样，方便了工厂，也加速了商品流转。在工业生产不断增长的基础上，这个站十一月份的商品采购总值比去年同期上升百分之六十，有力地支持了各地秋后旺季市场的供应。（附图片）
