Our Hebei Medical College, under the leadership of the worker and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, has sent over 2,000 revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to the Taihang Mountain area, covering seven counties including Ping Shan, Zan Huang, and Jing Xing, 100 communes, and 929 production brigades. We have joined the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in carrying out a revolution in medical education. Through half a year of revolutionary practice, we believe that to consolidate and develop the cooperative medical system, we must follow Chairman Mao's great directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." We must send a large number of personnel and resources from the cities to the countryside to strengthen the medical and health forces in rural areas. Revolutionary medical personnel must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line, establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, improve medical work, save cooperative medical funds, and contribute to the consolidation of the cooperative medical system. Our experiences are as follows:

First, we must criticize the bourgeois idea of believing in large prescriptions and expensive medicines to cure diseases. We must promote simple treatments and adhere to the principle of curing diseases without spending money or spending little money to cure serious diseases. Practice has proven that simple treatments can cure many common diseases in the countryside and are very popular among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Based on the principle of traditional cupping therapy, we created the "needle suction small cup therapy," which has achieved good results in treating hypertension, asthma, gastric ulcers, infantile paralysis, and other conditions. Other treatments, such as using massage to treat back, leg, and arm pain, and using acupuncture to treat neurasthenia, abdominal pain, and deaf-mutism, have also been very effective. Poor peasant Gao Deyi suffered from a trapezius muscle injury, with long-term neck pain. After seven massage treatments, he was cured, spending only 1.4 yuan on registration fees. He was very satisfied and said, "I was cured of my disease for just 1.4 yuan. This method is truly wonderful. Thank Chairman Mao for his good leadership!" In addition to widely using simple treatments, we can also use folk remedies, tested prescriptions, and folk remedies to treat the poor and lower-middle peasants. Using these treatments can achieve the goal of curing diseases without spending money or spending little money to cure serious diseases. After implementing the cooperative medical system, a large amount of cooperative medical funds can be saved.

Second, we must criticize the idea of pursuing size and foreign influence while neglecting traditional Chinese medicine and herbs. Units implementing the cooperative medical system can collect, process, and prepare some commonly used medicines according to local conditions. Our vast mountainous and plain areas have many wild medicinal herbs, and many poor and lower-middle peasants have the knowledge and experience of collecting herbs. We should fully mobilize the masses to collect medicinal herbs and process them. Practice has proven that this is completely feasible. In the past month, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we have collected over 100 kinds of medicinal herbs, totaling over 2,000 jin, and produced over 60 kinds of prepared medicines. These medicines are inexpensive and effective, playing a significant role in treating the poor and lower-middle peasants.

We believe that revolutionary medical personnel can ensure that chronic patients receive regular treatment without spending money, avoiding the problem of insufficient cooperative medical funds, and playing an important role in consolidating and developing the cooperative medical system.

    充分发挥中医中药的作用
    我们河北医学院，在工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，二千多名革命师生员工，深入太行山区平山、赞皇、井陉等七个县，一百个公社，九百二十九个生产大队，和广大贫下中农一起，进行医学教育革命。通过半年来的革命实践，我们认为要巩固和发展合作医疗制度，必须遵循毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大教导，把城市大量的人力物力下放到农村，充实农村的医疗卫生力量。革命的医务人员，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义卫生路线流毒，树立全心全意为贫下中农服务的思想，改进医疗工作，节约合作医疗基金，为巩固合作医疗制度贡献力量。我们的体会：
    第一，必须批判迷信大药方、贵重药才能治好病的资产阶级思想，推广简易疗法，坚持不花钱能治病，少花钱治大病的原则。实践证明，简易疗法能治农村许多常见病，很受贫下中农欢迎。根据民间拔火罐原理创造的“针吸小罐疗法”，治疗高血压、哮喘病、胃溃疡、婴儿瘫等，收到了很好的效果。其他如用按摩治疗腰、腿、胳膊疼，用针灸治疗神经衰弱、肚子疼、聋哑症等，效果也都很好。贫农高德义患斜方肌损伤，脖子长期疼痛，用按摩疗法七次即痊愈，仅花挂号费一角四分。他十分满意地说：“一角四分钱就治好了我的病，这个方法真是妙，感谢毛主席好领导！”除广泛应用简易疗法外，还可以广泛应用土方、验方、偏方，给贫下中农治病。采用这些疗法，就能达到不花钱能治病，少花钱治大病的目的。在实行合作医疗制度后，就可以大量节省合作医疗基金。
    第二，必须批判贪大求洋，轻视中医中药思想。实行合作医疗制度的单位，可以因地制宜采药、加工配制一些常用药品。我国广大山区和平原，都有很多野生中药，而且很多贫下中农具有采药知识和经验。应该充分发动群众采集中药，进行加工。实践证明，这一点是完全可以做到的。近一个月来，我们在贫下中农的帮助下，就采集了中药一百余种，二千余斤，制出成药六十多种，这些药价格低，疗效好，为贫下中农治病发挥了很大作用。
    我们认为，革命的医务人员，做到以上两点，就能保证慢性病人经常治疗不花钱，就会避免合作医疗基金不够用的问题，对巩固和发展合作医疗制度会起重要作用。　河北医学院革命委员会
