Medical personnel from Gansu Province and Lanzhou City, in accordance with Chairman Mao's directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," have organized large numbers of medical and health workers to go to the mountains and countryside to treat the poor and lower-middle peasants, receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and achieve good results.

More than 1,400 medical and health workers from Gansu Province and Lanzhou City have gone to the mountains and countryside. They formed the "June 26" Rural Health Work Team and began in June, successively going to 28 counties in eight districts across the province. They not only treat and prevent diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants but also receive re-education from them. Upon arriving at each location, the first thing they do is to study Chairman Mao's works together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest directives and the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are issued, they promptly and accurately propagate them. A part of the medical personnel who went to Minqin County stayed up all night by the radio, using flashlights to record Chairman Mao's latest directives word for word and quickly and accurately convey them to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised them, saying, "This time the medical team is different from before; they first brought us Mao Zedong Thought."

The health work teams that went to various counties and communes made setting up and running well Mao Zedong Thought study classes a key task for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They themselves set up classes, worked with local health personnel to set up classes, and collaborated with the poor and lower-middle peasants to set up classes, educating all members of the health work teams.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching to "completely, thoroughly serve the people," the medical personnel climbed mountains and crossed rivers, going deep into the fields, villages, and courtyards to carry out mobile medical services. Twelve members of a health work team that went to Zhenyuan County traveled a cumulative distance of over 1,500 li in one month to treat diseases. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "In the past, when we were sick, we couldn't even invite a doctor, but now the doctors come without being invited." They praised the members of the "June 26" Rural Health Work Team as "good doctors sent by Chairman Mao."

After going to the countryside, these medical personnel saw the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants personally denouncing the heinous crimes Liu Shaoqi committed in the field of medical and health work, receiving profound education. They turned examination rooms, operating tables, fields, villages, and courtyards into battlefields for criticizing and repudiating Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line in medical and health work. In their work, they thought of everything for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Medical personnel who went to Gannan insisted on the principle of not spending money, spending less money, and curing diseases, vigorously promoting acupuncture treatment, which was well received by the poor herdsmen. Some medical personnel who went to Huining County actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought and successfully performed a cesarean section for a poor female peasant community member who was in danger due to difficult childbirth, using six vascular clamps and one surgical knife in a small commune health clinic. Some medical personnel who went to Gulang County broke through departmental boundaries, successfully removing a bladder stone with a diameter of five centimeters and weighing 42 grams from a lower-middle peasant community member, Guo Baozhu, performed by an oral surgeon.

The various health work teams that went deep into the countryside also actively trained rural health workers and midwives from the poor and lower-middle peasants, teaching them how to treat common and frequently occurring diseases in rural areas, and determined to build a rural health team in the style of "barefoot doctors."

    甘肃医务人员上山下乡为贫下中农治病
    他们坚持不花钱、少花钱、治好病的原则，大力开展针灸治疗，积极从贫下中农中培养农村卫生员、接生员，贫下中农称赞他们是“毛主席派来的好医生”
    新华社兰州四日电　甘肃省和兰州市两级卫生系统革命委员会，遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，结合本单位的斗、批、改，组织大批医疗卫生工作人员上山下乡，为贫下中农治病，接受贫下中农的再教育，收到了良好效果。
    甘肃省和兰州市两级上山下乡的医疗卫生工作人员先后共有一千四百多名。他们组成“六·二六”农村卫生工作队，于今年六月开始，陆续分赴全省八个专区的二十八个县，一面给贫下中农防病、治病，一面接受贫下中农的再教育。他们每到一地，第一件大事就是同贫下中农一道共同活学活用毛主席著作，向广大群众宣传毛泽东思想。毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令一发表，他们都闻风而动，大张旗鼓地进行宣传。到民勤县的一部分医务人员，在毛主席的最新指示发表时，他们夜间守在收音机旁，打着手电，把毛主席的最新指示一字一句地记下来，最迅速最准确地传达给广大贫下中农。贫下中农赞扬说：“这次医疗队下来与过去不同，首先给我们带来了毛泽东思想。”下到各县、各公社的卫生工作队，把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班作为活学活用毛泽东思想、斗私批修的大课堂。他们自己办，和当地卫生人员一起办，和贫下中农共同办，使卫生工作队全体战士受到很大的教育。
    广大医务人员遵照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的伟大教导，爬山涉水，深入田间地头、村庄院落，开展巡回医疗工作。去镇原县的一个卫生工作队的十二名队员，在一个月中出去巡回治病累计行程一千五百多华里。贫下中农高兴地说：“以前我们有病，请医生都请不上，现在不请医生就来了。”他们称赞“六·二六”农村卫生工作队的队员是“毛主席派来的好医生”。
    这批上山下乡的医务人员到农村以后，看到广大贫下中农用亲身经历控诉刘少奇在医疗卫生战线上所犯的滔天罪行，受到了深刻的教育。他们也把诊病室、手术台、田间地头、村庄院落，作为大批判的战场，狠批刘少奇在医疗卫生工作上的修正主义路线。他们在工作中一切为贫下中农着想。去甘南的医务人员，在桑科草原为贫苦牧民治病中，坚持不花钱、少花钱、治好病的原则，大力开展针灸治疗，很受贫苦牧民欢迎。去会宁县的一部分医务人员，活学活用毛泽东思想，在一个小小的公社卫生院里，用六把血管钳子和一把手术刀，为一个因难产发生危险的贫农女社员成功地完成了剖腹生产的手术。去古浪县的一部分医务人员，打破分科界限，成功地由一个口腔科医生为下中农社员郭宝珠从膀胱中取出了一个直径五厘米、重四十二克的结石。
    深入农村的各卫生工作队还积极从贫下中农中培养农村卫生员、接生员，教他们学习农村常见病、多发病的治疗方法，决心建立一支“赤脚医生”式的农村卫生队伍。
