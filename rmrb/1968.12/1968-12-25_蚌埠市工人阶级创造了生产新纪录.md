The working class of Bengbu City, Anhui Province, has created new production records through studying the history of the two-line struggle within the Party and carrying out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. Socialist enthusiasm has reached an unprecedented height. They have seized the revolution, promoted production, and vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution activities, driving the development of production.

In November, the city's total industrial output value increased by 29 percent compared to October, setting a historical high. By the end of November, more than 30 factories in the city had completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the targets. Major products such as diesel engines, agricultural pumps, soap, and hemp cloth have all completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the targets.

The working class of Bengbu insists on leading production with revolution, promoting production. After the publication of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the Anhui Water Conservancy Machinery Factory organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to implement the communiqué, focused on class struggle and the two-line struggle education, fully mobilized the masses, carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and did a good job in cleaning up the class ranks and rectifying the Party. This further enhanced the consciousness of class struggle and two-line struggle among the broad revolutionary cadres and workers, promoting the development of production. Workers successfully experimented with 11 innovation projects in a short period.

    蚌埠市工人阶级创造了生产新纪录
    安徽省蚌埠市工人阶级通过学习党内两条路线斗争史，深入持久地开展革命大批判，社会主义积极性空前高涨。他们狠抓革命，猛促生产，大力开展技术革新和技术革命活动，推动了生产的发展。
    十一月份全市工业总产值比十月份增加百分之二十九，创造了历史最高纪录。到十一月底，全市已有三十多个工厂提前超额完成了全年生产计划。柴油机、农业泵、肥皂、麻布等主要产品都已提前超额完成全年生产计划。
    蚌埠工人阶级坚持以革命统帅生产，促进生产。安徽水利机械厂在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，大办落实公报的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，充分发动群众，深入开展革命大批判，认真做好清理阶级队伍和整党建党等工作，进一步提高了广大革命职工阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，推动了生产的发展。工人们在很短时间内就试验成功了十一项革新项目。
