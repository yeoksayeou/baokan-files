Thousands of citizens, students, and farmers from the suburbs of Bakhthapur in Nepal held a massive demonstration on December 7 to protest against the Indian reactionaries' expansionist and aggressive policies towards Nepal.

The demonstrators angrily shouted, "Down with the Indian reactionaries!" "Down with the Indian aggressors!" "Down with the Indian expansionists!"

Before the march, the demonstrators held a protest meeting. At the meeting, many speakers strongly condemned the Indian expansionists for frequently sending troops and police to invade Nepal's territory, killing and plundering Nepalese people, and attempting to annex Nepal. They pointed out in their speeches that the Nepalese people resolutely oppose the Indian government's aggressive policies. As long as the Nepalese people have a drop of blood, they will never allow the Indian government to annex an inch of Nepal's territory.

During the meeting, the crowd repeatedly chanted, "Oppose the Indian authorities' invasion of Nepal's territory!" "All Nepalese people unite to oppose Indian aggression!"

People in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and Lalitpur, a city near Kathmandu, held demonstrations on December 2 and 4, respectively, to strongly protest against the Indian reactionary government officials' invasion of Nepal's territory and the abduction of four Nepalese people.
