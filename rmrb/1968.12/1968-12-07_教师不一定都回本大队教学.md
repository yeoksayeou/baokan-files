Teachers do not necessarily have to return to their own production brigades for teaching. Is it definitely better for all teachers to return to their own production brigades for teaching? This is worth studying. I believe that it is better for teachers to be a bit farther from home. This way, it can avoid teachers being affected by family life and family conflicts, thus impacting their teaching work.

We should also believe that, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, all revolutionary teachers, whether working in their own production brigades or in other places, can carry out their ideological revolutionization through accepting re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, and contribute their strength to the people.

    教师不一定都回本大队教学
    教师都回本大队教学，是否一定都好，值得研究。我认为，教师离家远点是比较好的。这样可以避免教师因为家庭生活、家庭矛盾而影响教学工作。
    我们还应当相信，广大革命教师在毛泽东思想的哺育下，不论在本大队或在外地工作，都能够在接受贫下中农的再教育中搞好思想革命化，为人民贡献出自己的力量。
