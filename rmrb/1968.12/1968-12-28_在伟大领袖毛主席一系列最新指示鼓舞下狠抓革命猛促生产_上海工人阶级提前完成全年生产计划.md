Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Shanghai's working class has been vigorously promoting revolution and production. With the support of various regions across the country, they have completed the city's annual industrial production plan ahead of schedule on December 25. This year's industrial output has far surpassed that of 1967, setting a new record for this industrial city. Currently, revolutionary cadres and workers are actively preparing for an even greater leap in industrial production next year.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 26 — Under the guidance and inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with the support of various regions across the country, Shanghai's working class has been vigorously promoting revolution and production. They have completed the city's 1968 annual industrial production plan ahead of schedule on December 25. This year's industrial output has far surpassed that of 1967, setting a new record for this industrial city.

	Currently, the entire industrial front in Shanghai is thriving. After achieving a great victory in this year's industrial production, the broad masses of workers are advancing further with a spirit of "seizing the day." They are making both ideological and material preparations for an even greater leap in industrial production next year.

	Shanghai's working class has been resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fully playing the leading role of the working class, and ensuring production growth by putting revolution in command. This year, they have produced steel, steel products, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyed fabrics, watches, bicycles, sewing machines, antibiotics, electric motors, diesel engines, tractors, machine tools, cigarettes, transistors, radios, and other major products, all of which have far exceeded last year's levels. At the same time, they have successfully manufactured a large number of urgently needed new products for the country, including China's first large-scale planing machine, high-precision planing machine, giant boring machine, optical curve grinding machine, 30,000-volt, 20,000-hertz high-frequency generator, various high-grade alloy steels, as well as special steel plates, pipes, and materials. The appearance of these major new products eloquently proves that the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create any miracle.

	The unprecedentedly good situation on Shanghai's industrial front has emerged from the extensive and in-depth study of the history of the struggle between the two lines. After Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be frequently and repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell only a few people; it must be made known to the broad masses of revolutionary people," was issued, Shanghai's working class quickly launched an in-depth study of the history of the struggle between the two lines. They combined this study with the practical struggles of each period, held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, enthusiastically praised the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and severely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Workers in Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, Shanghai Valve No. 1 Factory, Dongfanghong Shipyard, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Shanghai Special Steel Pipe Factory, Shanghai Ferroalloy Factory, Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, Shanghai Heavy Machine Tool Factory, China Clock Factory, Shanghai Match Factory, Shanghai Watch Factory, Shanghai Radio No. 1 Factory, Shanghai Refining Plant, Lianhuang Chemical Plant, and Shanghai No. 30 Cotton Mill, among others, in the process of studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, linked the two-year struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and further recognized that this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution "is completely necessary and very timely." This further ignited their revolutionary enthusiasm, promoting the vigorous development of struggle, criticism, and transformation, as well as industrial production.

	"Without destruction, there can be no construction." Following Chairman Mao's great teaching, Shanghai's working class has, since this year, carried out a more in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism from all aspects, and resolutely implementing the "Anshan Constitution" as instructed by Chairman Mao, ensuring the continuous rise of industrial production. The broad masses of workers have set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in front of steel furnaces, next to machine tools, and inside and outside workshops. They linked traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in their factories with Liu Shaoqi, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's traitorous philosophy and the heinous crimes of this handful of bad elements in their attempt to restore capitalism. Many factories also severely criticized the struggle between the two lines in the field of production, insisted on putting proletarian politics in command, launched mass movements, and thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "material incentives," "profit in command," and "expert management." Workers used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide and command everything, quickly solving many long-standing technical bottlenecks, successfully developing a large number of new products, and some new products even catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced levels.

	Workers in the medium plate workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant broke through Liu Shaoqi's revisionist management line and "crawling philosophy," shattered the constraints of foreign frameworks and doctrines, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "self-reliance," overcame various difficulties and successfully rolled out a new type of steel plate with high hardness, high strength, and low thermal conductivity after five days of arduous struggle. In the past, the chemical system took one or two years to build and put into operation projects for producing red pigments, methanol, nitric acid, and other raw materials; now, by fully mobilizing the masses, they have successfully built several such projects in just a few months. The revolutionary workers of Shanghai Daily Chemical Can Factory angrily denounced the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his Shanghai agents Chen Pishan and Cao Qiqiao for their outrageous opposition and resistance to the printing of Chairman Mao's portraits, and with their profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, overcame numerous equipment difficulties and used a lithographic machine to print 800,000 copies of the metal portrait "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan." Many factories, through revolutionary criticism, broke the old rules of "cadres setting targets and workers following them," and a revolutionary scene emerged where the revolutionary masses discussed, formulated, and overfulfilled plans on their own.

	Following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "seriously carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation," Shanghai's working class combined the daring-to-think and daring-to-act revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude, vigorously reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, streamlined organizations, and transferred office personnel to the front lines, thereby promoting a significant increase in industrial production. Many factories organized large numbers of worker amateur investigation teams to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations and research on various unreasonable regulations and systems, widely mobilized the masses to discuss, changed what needed to be changed, and broke what needed to be broken, beginning to establish new systems that are conducive to revolution and production.

	This year, the industrial front in Shanghai sent a large number of outstanding workers to join the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, entering various fields of the superstructure to lead struggle, criticism, and transformation. Although the number of workers in the factories decreased and the tasks increased, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers fully played the leading role of the working class, deeply carried out mass technical innovation and technological revolution activities, tapped potential to the fullest, and many products increased in output by several times or even tens of times, ensuring the continuous leap in production.

	The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great driving force for socialist production in our country. It is promoting and will continue to promote our country's socialist construction to achieve new leaps." Now, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers on Shanghai's industrial front are continuing to study the communiqué of the plenum in depth, comprehensively implement the various combat tasks proposed by the plenum, actively prepare, and welcome an even greater leap in industrial production next year and the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party. The broad masses of workers say that the most fundamental preparation is to comprehensively implement the various combat tasks proposed by the plenum and arm oneself with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They also, through reviewing the struggle practice of seizing revolution and promoting production this year, summed up experiences, found gaps, and further recognized that to ensure production continues to thrive, it is necessary to grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示鼓舞下狠抓革命猛促生产
    上海工人阶级提前完成全年生产计划
    在全国各地大力支援下，今年完成的工业总产值，大大超过了一九六七年，创造了这个工业城市历史上的最高水平。目前广大革命职工正在积极做好准备工作，迎接明年工业生产的更大跃进
    新华社上海二十六日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引和鼓舞下，在全国各地的大力支援下，上海工人阶级狠抓革命，猛促生产，已提前在本月二十五日完成了一九六八年全市工业总产值计划。他们今年完成的工业总产值，大大超过了一九六七年，创造了这个工业城市历史上的最高水平。
    目前，全市工业战线呈现着一派欣欣向荣的大好景象，广大工人群众在夺得今年全年工业生产巨大胜利的基础上，正在乘胜前进，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，为明年工业生产的更大跃进作好思想和物质的准备。
    上海工人阶级坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，以革命统帅生产，保证了生产的大幅度增长。今年，他们已生产出的钢、钢材、棉纱、棉布、印染布、手表、自行车、缝纫机、抗菌素、电动机、柴油机、拖拉机、机床、卷烟、晶体管、收音机等主要产品，产量都大大超过了去年全年的水平。在这同时，他们还制造成功了大批我国急需的重大新产品，其中有我国第一台大型平面磨床，高精度铲磨机，巨型贯穿式深孔镗床，光学曲线磨床，三十千伏安二万赫兹高频发电机，各种高级合金钢，以及特种钢板、钢管、钢材等等。这些重大新产品的出现雄辩地说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，什么人间奇迹都能够创造出来。
    上海工业战线空前大好的形势，是在广泛深入的两条路线斗争史的学习运动中出现的。伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表后，上海工人阶级闻风而动，迅速开展了深入学习两条路线斗争史的运动。他们结合每一时期的斗争实践，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，热烈赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，极大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。上海国棉十七厂、上海阀门一厂、东方红造船厂、上钢三厂、上海异型钢管厂、上海铁合金厂、上海柴油机厂、上海机床厂、上海电机厂、上海重型机床厂、中国钟厂、上海火柴厂、上海手表厂、上海无线电一厂、上海炼油厂、燎原化工厂和国棉三十厂等单位的广大工人群众，在学习、落实毛主席的最新指示和党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务的过程中，联系两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，热烈赞颂以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的丰功伟绩，更深刻地认识了这次无产阶级文化大革命“是完全必要的，是非常及时的”，从而进一步激发了冲天的革命干劲，推动了斗、批、改和工业生产的蓬勃发展。
      “不破不立。”上海工人阶级遵循毛主席这一伟大教导，今年以来，更深入持久地开展了革命大批判，从各个方面肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义的流毒，坚决按照毛主席批示的“鞍钢宪法”办事，保证了工业生产的持续上升。广大工人群众在炼钢炉前，在机床旁边，在车间内外，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。他们把本厂的叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子同刘少奇挂上钩，狠批刘少奇的叛徒哲学，狠批这一小撮坏家伙阴谋复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。许多工厂还狠抓生产领域中的两条路线斗争，坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，把刘少奇的“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”、“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货批得臭不可闻。工人们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导一切，统帅一切，迅速解决了许多过去长期没有解决的技术关键问题，试制成功了大批新产品，有些新产品赶上并超过了世界先进水平。
    上钢三厂中板车间工人大破刘少奇的修正主义办企业路线和“爬行哲学”，冲破洋框框、洋教条的束缚，在毛主席“自力更生”的光辉思想指引下，克服种种困难，经过五天的艰苦奋战，成功地轧制出了一种硬度大、强度高、导热系数低的新品种钢板。化工系统过去搞生产红颜料、甲醇、硝酸等原料的基建项目，要一两年才能建成上马；现在，充分发动群众，几个月就建设成功了。上海日用化学制罐厂的革命职工，愤怒地声讨了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在上海代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流猖狂反对和抵制印制毛主席像的滔天罪行，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，克服了设备方面的重重困难，用石印机印制了《毛主席去安源》金属像八十万幅。许多工厂通过革命大批判，打破了过去“干部订指标，工人照着搞”的旧规，出现了革命群众自己讨论计划、制定计划和超额完成计划的革命景象。
    上海工人阶级遵循伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的教导，把敢想、敢闯的革命精神和严格的科学态度结合起来，大力改革不合理的规章制度，精简机构、下放科室人员，从而促进了工业生产的大幅度增长。许多工厂组织了大批工人业余调查组，对各种不合理的规章制度，进行了深入细致的调查研究，广泛发动群众进行讨论，该改的改，该破的破，开始建立起有利于革命和生产的新制度。
    今年，上海工业战线调出了大批优秀工人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻上层建筑各个领域领导斗、批、改，工厂人员减少，任务加重。但是，广大革命职工充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，深入地开展了群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动，大挖潜力，许多产品产量成倍甚至几十倍增长，保证了生产的持续跃进。
    党的八届十二中全会公报指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是我国社会主义生产的伟大推动力。它正在促进并将继续促进我国的社会主义建设出现新的飞跃。”现在，上海工业战线广大革命职工正在继续深入学习全会公报，全面落实全会提出的各项战斗任务，积极做好准备工作，迎接明年工业生产的更大跃进，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开。广大工人群众说，千准备万准备，最根本的准备是全面落实全会提出的各项战斗任务，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑。他们还通过回顾今年抓革命促生产的斗争实践，总结经验，找出差距，进一步认识到，要保证生产蒸蒸日上，必须狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，认真搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
