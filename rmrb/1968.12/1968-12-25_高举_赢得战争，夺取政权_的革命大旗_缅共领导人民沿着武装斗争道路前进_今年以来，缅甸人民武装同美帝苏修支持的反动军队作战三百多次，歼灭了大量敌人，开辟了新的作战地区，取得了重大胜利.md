The Burmese people's armed forces, under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, have hoisted the banner of "Winning the War, Seizing Power," and have fought tenaciously and bravely, achieving significant victories in 1968.

Since the beginning of this year, the Burmese people's armed forces have engaged in fierce battles with the reactionary military forces of the Ne Win clique, supported by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, fighting over 300 times. The people's armed forces have not only continued to be active in the vicinity of various base areas but have also opened up new battlefields. This indicates that the people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party are continually developing, and the scale of guerrilla warfare is expanding.

Defeating the Counter-Revolutionary "Encirclement and Suppression" and Annihilating the Enemy's Combat Effectiveness

Over the past year, the Burmese people's armed forces have repeatedly thwarted the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" launched by the Burmese reactionary government against the people's armed forces in various places. In August of last year, the Burmese reactionary government mobilized dozens of battalions, using weapons and equipment supplied by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, to launch an attack on the Burmese Communist Party's revolutionary base areas such as the Bago Mountains. With the full support of the people in the base areas, the people's armed forces bravely joined the battle. When the enemy was deep inside the base area, exhausted and empty-handed, the people's armed forces launched continuous ambushes and attacks, dealing heavy blows to the reactionary military. From August last year to May this year, the people's armed forces in the Bago Mountains and surrounding areas fought over 140 battles, annihilating a large number of the enemy's combat forces and forcing the enemy to retreat in disarray.

After June this year, the Burmese reactionary government again rallied reactionary military, police, and local reactionary armed "self-defense forces" to conduct counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" in the Bago Mountains and the Irrawaddy Delta. The people's armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party and the Karen people's armed forces launched fierce counterattacks against the advancing reactionary military, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

Flexible and Aggressive Guerrilla Tactics to Actively Strike the Enemy

While thwarting the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," the people's armed forces in various parts of Burma have also used flexible and mobile guerrilla tactics to actively strike the enemy. They ambushed reactionary military and police patrols, attacked enemy outposts and police stations, and assaulted some towns weakly guarded by the enemy. In these battles, the people's armed forces annihilated the enemy by platoons and companies and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies. On March 6 this year, over 200 people's armed forces captured the town of An in the Arakan region, annihilating a group of reactionary military and police, including the police chief, occupying the town for 24 hours, destroying the police barracks, warehouses, and communication facilities, and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. In mid-March, the people's armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party attacked a reactionary police detachment on the seaside of Danold County in the Dala region, annihilating the entire enemy force. In late March, the people's armed forces attacked a police station in the Bhamo region, seizing all the weapons in the police station. The people's armed forces also fought several brilliant battles in some places in Upper Burma and Shan State.

Disrupting the Enemy's Transportation and Forcing the Enemy to Dispersed Forces

The Burmese people's armed forces have achieved significant victories in attacking and disrupting the enemy's transportation lines. On June 5, the people's armed forces blew up an enemy armored train on the Yangon-Mandalay railway line in the Bago region, annihilating 14 enemy soldiers. On the evening of June 21, the people's armed forces blew up an enemy armored train with landmines in the Yaw region, annihilating an entire enemy platoon and seizing three machine guns, two rifles, and a batch of ammunition. On July 4, the people's armed forces intercepted two motor-sailboats of the reactionary government in the coastal area of Tharrawaddy County, seizing a large amount of supplies. The frequent attacks by the Burmese people's armed forces on the enemy's water and land transportation lines have forced the enemy to deploy a large number of military and police along several major railways, roads, and shipping lines, making their forces even more dispersed. To get out of the predicament, the Burmese reactionary government has imposed martial law along the railways, canceled night trains, and ordered the installation of half-height protective steel plates on ships. However, they still cannot escape the attacks of the people's armed forces. In the southeastern part of Burma, the active activities of the people's armed forces in the Dala region have often caused the water and land transportation from Tharrawaddy to Danold to be paralyzed.

Actively Carrying Out Mass Work and Mobilizing Peasants to Root Out Traitorous Elements and Local Tyrants

While fighting fiercely with the enemy, the people's armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party have also actively carried out mass work, gaining the enthusiastic support of the broad masses. In some places in the administrative regions of Bago, Irrawaddy, and Arakan, the people's armed forces have mobilized peasants to carry out the struggle to root out traitorous elements and local tyrants, striking at the leaders of the reactionary local armed "self-defense forces" and the most vicious reactionary officials and local bullies. In mid-July, in the forest area of the southern part of the Yaw region, the people's armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party assisted the local masses in arresting nine reactionary officials and bullies, seizing their property, and greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people. The people's armed forces have also mobilized the masses in various places to destroy the so-called "security administrative committees," "land committees," "village agricultural cooperatives," and other institutions set up by the reactionary government in rural areas to oppress and exploit the people. Through these struggles, the political consciousness of the masses has been raised, and the close ties between the people's armed forces and the masses have been strengthened. Many young people have enthusiastically joined the people's armed forces, and in some places, militia organizations have been established, providing strong support for the revolutionary armed struggle.

The victorious development of the Burmese people's revolutionary armed struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the Ne Win clique. Currently, the political and economic crises of the Ne Win government are becoming increasingly severe, and the contradictions within the ruling clique are deepening. These situations indicate that the Ne Win reactionary ruling clique is in a state of internal and external difficulties and has reached a dead end.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The situation in Burma is the same. Although the Burmese people will still encounter various difficulties on their forward march, these are difficulties on the way forward and are completely surmountable. The Burmese people will certainly achieve the final victory of the national democratic revolution by persisting in the correct path of armed struggle.

    高举“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命大旗
    缅共领导人民沿着武装斗争道路前进
    今年以来，缅甸人民武装同美帝苏修支持的反动军队作战三百多次，歼灭了大量敌人，开辟了新的作战地区，取得了重大胜利
    据新华社二十三日讯　本社记者报道：缅甸人民武装在缅甸共产党的领导下，高举“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命大旗，艰苦奋斗，英勇作战，一九六八年取得了重大胜利。
    今年以来，缅甸人民武装同美帝、苏修支持下的奈温反动集团的军队进行了激烈的搏斗，先后作战三百多次。人民武装不仅继续活跃在各根据地附近，而且开辟了新的作战地区。这说明，缅共领导的人民武装正在不断发展，游击战的规模也越来越大。
    粉碎反革命“围剿”歼灭敌人有生力量
    一年来，缅甸人民武装一次又一次地粉碎了缅甸反动政府对各地人民武装疯狂进行的反革命“围剿”。去年八月，缅甸反动政府调动了几十个营的兵力，使用美帝和苏修供应的武器和装备，向缅共革命根据地勃固山区等地发动进攻。缅共人民武装在根据地人民的全力支持下英勇地投入了战斗。人民武装在敌人深入根据地到处扑空、疲惫不堪的时候，连续伏击和袭击敌人，给反动军队以沉重的打击。从去年八月到今年五月，缅共人民武装在勃固山区及附近地带共作战一百四十多次，大量歼灭敌人的有生力量，迫使敌人狼狈后撤。
    今年六月以后，缅甸反动政府又纠集反动军队、警察和地方反动武装“自卫队”，在勃固山区和伊洛瓦底江三角洲一带进行反革命“围剿”。缅共人民武装和克伦族人民武装对前去进犯的反动军队给以猛烈反击，使敌人损失惨重。
    游击战术机动灵活积极主动打击敌人
    缅甸各地人民武装，在粉碎敌人“围剿”的同时，还运用机动灵活的游击战术，积极主动地打击敌人。他们伏击反动军警的巡逻队，袭击敌军哨所和警察局，攻打一些敌人守备薄弱的城镇。在这些战斗中，人民武装整班整排地消灭敌人，并且缴获许多武器和军用物资。今年三月六日，人民武装两百多人攻克若开地区的安镇，消灭了包括警察局长在内的一批反动军警，占领该镇二十四小时，破坏了警察营房、仓库和电讯设备，缴获大批武器和弹药。三月中旬，缅共人民武装在德林达伊地区丹老县的海边，袭击一个反动警察分队，全部歼灭了这股敌人。三月下旬，人民武装袭击了卑谬县一个警察局，缴获了这个警察局的全部武器。人民武装在上缅甸和掸邦的一些地方，也打了多次漂亮仗。
    破坏敌人交通运输迫使敌人分散兵力
    缅甸人民武装袭击和破坏敌人的交通运输线取得了重大胜利。六月五日，人民武装在勃固县境内的仰光—曼德勒铁路线上，炸毁敌人一辆护路装甲车，消灭敌军十四人。六月二十一日晚，人民武装在东吁县境内，又用地雷炸毁敌人护路装甲车一辆，全歼敌人一个班，缴获三挺机枪，两支步枪和一批弹药。七月四日，人民武装在土瓦县沿海截获反动政府的两艘机帆船，缴获了大量物资。缅甸人民武装对敌人水陆交通线的频繁出击，迫使敌人派出大量军警分布在几条主要的铁路、公路和航运线上，兵力更加分散。缅甸反动政府为了摆脱狼狈的处境，在铁路沿线实行戒严，取消夜间行车，并下令在轮船上加装半人高的防护钢板，但是，仍然逃脱不了人民武装的袭击。在缅甸东南部的德林达伊地区，人民武装的积极活动使从土瓦到丹老的水陆交通时常处于瘫痪状态。
    积极开展群众工作发动农民锄奸反霸
    缅共人民武装一面同敌人激烈作战，一面积极开展群众工作，得到广大群众的热烈支持。人民武装在勃固、伊洛瓦底、若开等行政区的一些地方，发动农民开展锄奸反霸斗争，打击反动地方武装“自卫队”的头目以及罪大恶极的反动官吏和土豪劣绅。七月中旬，在东吁县南部森林区，缅共人民武装协助当地群众逮捕反动官吏和恶霸九人，没收了他们的财产，大长了革命人民的志气。人民武装还在各地发动群众，摧毁反动政府设在农村的所谓“安全行政委员会”、“土地委员会”、“乡村农业合作社”等压迫和剥削人民的机构。通过这些斗争，提高了群众的政治觉悟，加强了人民武装同群众的密切联系，许多青年踊跃参加人民武装，有些地方还成立了民兵组织，有力地支援了革命武装斗争。
    缅甸人民革命武装斗争的胜利发展，沉重地打击了奈温集团的反动统治。目前，奈温政府的政治和经济危机日益深重，统治集团内部矛盾也越来越深刻化。这些情况说明，奈温反动统治集团内外交困，已陷于走投无路的地步。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。缅甸的形势也是这样。缅甸人民在前进的道路上虽然还会遇到各种困难，但是，这是前进中的困难，是完全可以克服的。缅甸人民坚持武装斗争的正确道路，定能夺取民族民主革命的最后胜利。
