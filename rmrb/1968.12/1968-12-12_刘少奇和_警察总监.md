The reactionary film "Visiting Indonesia" is a great exposure of the counter-revolutionary face of the traitor, inner traitor, and scab Liu Shaoqi. Here, we will take just one scene from it and compare it with Liu Shaoqi's criminal history to reveal his consistent betrayal of the revolution and the people, exposing his reactionary essence.

Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang ×× spent their days in Indonesia hobnobbing with the country's bourgeoisie leaders and reactionary right-wing military figures, doing everything they could to curry favor. There is one scene in the film: In Jogjakarta, the wife of the traitor Liu, Wang ××, specially posed for a photograph with the local feudal lord, the Sultan, and the Indonesian police chief. She shamelessly said, "With the police chief standing behind us, our safety is guaranteed." It is truly nauseating! It is too ugly! Too disgusting!

Coincidentally, in Liu Shaoqi's criminal history, there is a similar episode.

In 1927, the workers' revolutionary movement in Hubei was like a storm, sweeping and fierce, and the anti-imperialist struggle was also flourishing. Workers formed armed picket teams, fiercely attacking the foundations of reactionary rule. However, Liu Shaoqi, who was then the secretary of the Hubei Provincial General Union, was terrified. On the one hand, he did everything he could to sabotage the workers' armed forces, tying up all the guns and ammunition of the picket teams, even the wooden sticks of the children's corps, and handing them over to the Kuomintang reactionaries. On the other hand, he secretly begged the Kuomintang reactionary leader Wang Jingwei to "send four or five soldiers to protect" him. It was truly despicable to the extreme!

One scene, one shameful history, are both records of the traitor, inner traitor, and scab Liu Shaoqi begging the executioner to "protect" his life. Everyone knows that the Sultan of Jogjakarta and the Indonesian police chief are butchers who slaughter Indonesian communists and revolutionary people. Wang Jingwei is a butcher who slaughtered Chinese communists and revolutionary people. They are extremely reactionary and have blood debts piled high. Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang ×× want these bloodthirsty murderers to protect them, truly painting a picture of a servile and begging face!

This scene and this shameful history clearly tell us that Liu Shaoqi is a dog lackey on the bourgeoisie's ship. He dreams of restoring capitalism. Why does he feel "reassured" when protected by the reactionary army of the bourgeoisie, and feel "safe" when protected by the reactionary leaders of the bourgeoisie? This is because they are on the same path, doing the same evil deeds. Truly, "birds of a feather flock together." They are all agents of the bourgeoisie. For this reason, he calls the reactionary army of the bourgeoisie an "ideal tool," and is extremely attentive to the reactionary military leaders of Indonesia, wishing them to "take care of their health." He calls the Chinese reactionary warlords "rebirth parents" and the tyrant Jiang Jieshi a "revolutionary flag." For this reason, Liu the traitor is always terrified and hates the revolutionary armed forces to death, doing everything he can to sabotage the people's army and weaken the revolutionary armed forces, so that the bourgeoisie army can rule the world, and their "safety" would be completely "guaranteed." The facts are clear, the evidence is overwhelming: Liu Shaoqi is a criminal who is loyal to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything." An army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the people's army, the revolutionary army. It protects the interests of the people, it annihilates the reactionary army of the bourgeoisie, and it is the strong pillar to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The traitor, inner traitor, and scab Liu Shaoqi attempts to rely on the bourgeoisie army for "protection," attempts to rely on a few bourgeoisie leaders to seize political power from the people, truly a foolish dream!

    刘少奇和“警察总监”
    解放军某部　刘成华
    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇反革命嘴脸的大暴露。在这里，我们只把其中的一个镜头拿出来和刘少奇的罪恶历史做一对照，就可以看出他一贯出卖革命，出卖人民的反动本质。
    刘少奇和他的老婆王××，成天和印尼资产阶级头面人物以及反动右派军人头目鬼混，极尽献媚邀宠之能事。有这样一个镜头：在日惹，刘贼的老婆王××特意同当地土皇帝苏丹王和印尼警察总监一起照相留念，恬不知耻地说：“有警察总监站在我们后面，我们两人的安全就有了保证。”真是令人作呕！真是太丑了！太臭了！
    无独有偶。翻开刘少奇的罪恶历史，也有这样的一段纪录。
    一九二七年，湖北的工人革命运动，势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，反帝斗争也蓬勃发展起来。工人组成了武装纠察队，猛烈地冲击着反动统治的根基。可是当时窃据了湖北全省总工会秘书长的刘少奇却吓得胆颤心惊，一方面千方百计破坏工人武装，把纠察队的所有枪枝弹药，甚至连童子团的木棍也捆得整整齐齐，拱手交给了国民党反动派；一方面又暗地里向国民党反动派的头目汪精卫乞求“派四五个兵保护”他。真是卑鄙到了极点！
    一个镜头，一段丑史，都是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇请刽子手“保护”狗命的纪录。谁都知道，印尼的日惹苏丹王和警察总监是屠杀印尼共产党员和革命人民的大刽子手。汪精卫是屠杀中国共产党员和革命人民的大刽子手。他们血债累累，极端反动。刘少奇和他的老婆王××要这些血腥气十足的杀人魔鬼保护，真是活画出一副摇尾乞怜的丑嘴脸！
    这镜头和丑史清楚地告诉我们，刘少奇是资产阶级贼船上的一个狗奴才。他梦寐以求的就是复辟资本主义。他为什么让资产阶级的反动军队保护就感到“放心”，让资产阶级反动头目保护就感到“安全”有了“保证”了呢？这就因为他们走的是一条道，干的是同样罪恶的勾当。真是：“物以类聚，人以群分”。他们都是资产阶级的代理人。正因为这样，他把资产阶级的反动军队称做“理想的工具”，对印尼的反动军队头目百倍殷勤，祝他们“保重身体”。称中国的反动军阀是“再生父母”，称独夫民贼蒋介石是“革命的旗帜”。也正因为这样，刘贼对革命的武装总是怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计地要破坏人民军队，要削弱革命武装，好让资产阶级军队独霸世界，他们的“安全”就彻底有了“保证”。事实俱在，铁证如山，刘少奇是个罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派的忠实走狗。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队是人民的武装，革命的军队。是保护人民利益的，是消灭资产阶级反动军队，巩固无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇妄图靠资产阶级军队“保护”，妄图靠几个资产阶级头目，来专人民的政，真是痴心妄想！
