The Japanese people waged a magnificent struggle against U.S. imperialism and for national independence in 1968, striking a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the revisionist group of Kobayashi in the Japanese Communist Party. This reflects the accelerating awakening of the Japanese people.

The anti-U.S. movement surges forward

The Japanese people's anti-U.S. movement opened up a new situation at the beginning of this year. In mid-January, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, allowed the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" to enter the port of Sasebo. Japanese workers, youth, and students immediately took action and launched a struggle, firing the first shot of this year's anti-U.S. movement. Since then, a surging anti-U.S. movement has been sweeping across Japan. The farmers of Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka are fighting fiercely against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' plan to build a "New Tokyo International Airport," effectively blocking the reactionary Sato government's evil plan to build the airport. At the same time, railway workers went on strike, refusing to transport fuel for U.S. military aircraft; dock workers in Moji refused to unload military supplies from U.S. ships; workers and students in Kyushu joined forces to oppose the U.S. military authorities' plan to transport ammunition to the Yamada ammunition depot; university students in Tokyo launched one struggle after another to oppose the U.S. military's plan to build a field hospital in Hiyoshi. In places like Tachikawa, Hiyoshi, Zama, Iwakuni, Hokkaido, and Sagamihara, where there are U.S. military bases, anti-U.S. struggles have been continuously erupting. The movements to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to return Okinawa are particularly powerful. The struggles waged by the Japanese people are interwoven and mutually supportive, forming a mighty torrent that rolls on.

Launching fierce attacks on the enemy

In the course of the struggle, the broad masses of the Japanese people have fully displayed their courageous and tenacious fighting spirit. They fearlessly faced the fascist suppression of the reactionary police and launched sustained, fierce attacks on the enemy, making the reactionary police discomfited and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries tremble with fear.

In front of the "Defense Agency," a key department of the Japanese bourgeois state machine, patriotic youth waged a powerful anti-U.S. struggle. They bravely broke through the lines of armed military police, rushed into the "Defense Agency" building, destroyed the office of the "Central Base Communications Team," hoisted a red flag on the iron gate of the "Defense Agency," and wrote slogans on the walls such as "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'" and "We fight for the people." This greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of Japan and thoroughly deflated the arrogance of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. In Sanrizuka, where the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries plan to build the "New Tokyo International Airport," local farmers and workers, youth, and students who came to support the farmers' struggle joined forces to engage in one battle after another with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The struggle of the farmers of Sanrizuka has been tenaciously sustained from the beginning of the year to the present, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Japanese people. On October 21, a magnificent and magnificent anti-U.S. struggle unfolded at Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, a key transportation hub for transporting fuel for U.S. military aircraft. A demonstration team composed of workers and students broke through the iron walls erected by the Japanese reactionary authorities and rushed into Shinjuku Station, engaging in close combat with the fascist police who came to suppress the demonstrators on the platform and railway tracks, blocking the transport of fuel for U.S. military aircraft.

The student movement has developed rapidly this year

It is worth noting that since this year, the student movement in Japan has developed rapidly, adding new content to the Japanese people's anti-U.S. and patriotic movement. This year, more than sixty universities across the country have launched large-scale struggles against the reactionary and decadent bourgeois education system and the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The strike by students of Tokyo University has lasted nearly three hundred days, and the strike by students of Nihon University has lasted more than two hundred days. They have driven the president of Tokyo University and the chairman of Nihon University off their positions and continue to occupy the school buildings, preparing for a protracted struggle. This is unprecedented in the history of the Japanese student movement. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement inevitably promotes the upsurge of the entire people's movement."

The Kobayashi group is despised by the people

In their heroic struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the Japanese people have, through their actual fighting actions, criticized the crimes of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kobayashi, which attempted to lead the people's struggle astray. In the past, the "mass struggles" launched by the Kobayashi group were completely legalistic. They emphasized that demonstrations and marches should be "orderly," even to the extent of slavishly allowing the marching columns to be led by reactionary police. If the flags held by the demonstrators were raised too high, they had to be lowered at the police's command. Such so-called struggles could only serve as decorations for bourgeois "democracy" without touching the fundamental interests of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. However, this year's anti-U.S. movement is in sharp contrast to the Kobayashi group's approach. The Japanese people have broken free from the legalistic framework and bravely fought the enemy with sticks, stones, and sickles. Through the struggle, the Japanese people have further realized that the "parliamentary road" advocated by the Kobayashi revisionist group must be smashed, and the Marxist-Leninist road of violent revolution must be adhered to. The truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is increasingly taking root among the Japanese workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao said: "People's social existence determines their thoughts. Once the advanced class's correct thoughts are grasped by the masses, they will become a material force for transforming society and the world." As more and more Japanese revolutionary people grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and combine them with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution, the Japanese people's anti-U.S. and patriotic movement will certainly develop further. It can be foreseen that 1969 will be a year of rapid progress for the Japanese people in their struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

    给美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团以沉重打击
    日本人民反美爱国斗争波澜壮阔
    据新华社二十二日讯　本社记者报道：日本人民在一九六八年展开了波澜壮阔的反美爱国斗争，给美日反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团以沉重的打击，反映了日本人民正在加速觉醒。
    反美运动一浪接着一浪
    日本人民的反美运动从今年一开始便打开了局面。一月中旬，美日反动派不顾日本人民的强烈反对，让美国核航空母舰“企业号”开进佐世保港。日本工人、青年、学生立即行动起来展开斗争，打响了今年反美斗争的第一炮。从这以后，一个汹涌澎湃的反美运动一浪接着一浪地在日本全国各地展开。千叶县三里塚农民反对美日反动派修建“新东京国际机场”的斗争，如火如荼，有效地阻止了佐藤反动政府修建机场的罪恶计划。同时，铁路工人举行罢工，拒绝运送美国军用飞机燃料；门司港的码头工人拒绝卸下美军船只上的军火；九州的工人和学生联合起来反对美军当局向山田军火库增运弹药；东京的大学生一次又一次地展开斗争，反对美军修建王子野战医院。在横田、板付、厚木、岩国、北富士、相模原市等地，凡是有美军基地的地方，都不断爆发反美斗争。要求粉碎日美“安全条约”和要求归还冲绳的运动，更是声势浩大。日本人民展开的这些斗争互相交织，彼此呼应，形成一股巨大的洪流，滚滚向前。
    向敌人发动猛烈的进攻
    在斗争中，广大日本人民充分发扬了英勇顽强的战斗精神。他们在反动警察的法西斯镇压面前，毫无畏惧，向敌人发动持续的、猛烈的进攻，打得反动警察狼狈不堪，使美日反动派心惊胆战。
    在日本资产阶级国家机器的要害部门“防卫厅”门前，爱国青年举行了强有力的反美斗争。他们勇敢地突破武装军警的封锁线，冲进“防卫厅”大楼，捣毁“中央基地通讯队”的电话交换台办公室，在“防卫厅”铁门上竖起红旗，在墙壁上写了“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”和“我们为人民而斗争”等口号，大长了日本革命人民的志气，大灭了美日反动派的威风。在美日反动派计划修建“新东京国际机场”所在地的三里塚，当地农民和前去支援农民斗争的工人、青年、学生一道，同美日反动派进行了一次又一次的较量。三里塚农民的斗争顽强地从年初坚持到现在，充分显示了日本人民的英雄气概。十月二十一日在运输美国军用飞机燃料的重要交通枢纽的东京新宿车站展开的反美斗争，场面更是雄伟壮丽。一支由工人和学生组成的示威队伍，踏破日本反动当局用铁板筑起的围墙，冲进新宿车站，在月台和火车轨道上同前去镇压示威群众的法西斯警察展开了短兵相接的搏斗，阻止运输美国军用飞机燃料。
    学生运动空前迅猛发展
    值得指出的是，今年以来，日本学生运动有了迅猛的发展，它为日本人民的反美爱国运动增添了新的内容。今年，日本的六十多所大学在全国各地掀起了规模巨大的斗争，反对反动腐朽的资产阶级教育制度和美日反动派的反动统治。东京大学学生的罢课已经坚持了近三百天，日本大学学生的罢课已经持续了二百多天。他们把东京大学校长和日本大学董事长赶下了台，并且继续占领学校大楼，准备进行持久斗争。这在日本学生运动史上是空前的。我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”
    宫本集团遭到人民唾弃
    日本人民在同美日反动派的英勇斗争中，用实际的战斗行动批判了日共宫本修正主义集团妄图把人民斗争引入歧途的罪行。过去由宫本集团发动的“群众斗争”，完全是合法主义的那一套。它们强调什么在示威游行中要“秩序井然”，甚至奴颜婢膝地让游行的队伍由反动警察领路。示威群众举的旗子高了一点，都要听从警察的摆布降低下来。这种所谓斗争只能充当资产阶级“民主”的点缀，而触动不了美日反动派的根本利益。但是，今年的反美运动同宫本集团的那一套形成鲜明对比。日本人民打破了合法主义的框框，用木棍、石头、镰刀勇敢地同敌人搏斗。日本人民通过斗争进一步认识到，宫本修正主义集团所鼓吹的“议会道路”必须粉碎，马克思列宁主义的暴力革命的道路必须坚持。“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理正在日本工、农和革命群众中间日益深入人心。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”随着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想被越来越多的日本革命人民所掌握，并与日本革命的具体实践结合起来，日本人民的反美爱国运动必将有新的发展。可以预料，一九六九年将是日本人民在争取独立、民主、和平、中立的大道上突飞猛进的一年。
