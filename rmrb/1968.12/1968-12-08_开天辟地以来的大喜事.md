The East Wind is sweeping, and red flags are everywhere. At this moment when the entire nation's hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians are studying, propagating, implementing, and ensuring the implementation of the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the *People's Daily* published an important report on the cooperative medical care system implemented by the Leyuan People's Commune in Changyang County, Hubei Province. This is the greatest care and protection that the proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, has shown for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants nationwide. It is also the greatest encouragement and motivation for us "barefoot doctors." We wholeheartedly support it and will carry it out to the letter. Let us shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! Implementing the cooperative medical care system is a great joy that poor and lower-middle peasants have never experienced since the beginning of the world. What they could not even dream of in the past, Chairman Mao has realized for them today. Chairman Mao is truly the great benefactor of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

We have grown up under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." We are "barefoot doctors" who participate in both production labor and the prevention and treatment of diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants. We believe that the significance of implementing the cooperative medical care system is extremely profound. Its benefits are as follows:

1. It solves the fundamental question of who medical and health work serves. On this question, there has been a fierce struggle between two lines over the past decade. For a long time, Liu Shaoqi and his agents on the medical and health front have vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line. They built hospitals in cities far from the countryside and kept most doctors in urban buildings to serve a small number of people in the cities, while the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have long suffered from a lack of doctors and medicine. The implementation of the cooperative medical care system can fundamentally change the above unreasonable situation and ensure that rural medical and health work truly serves the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

2. Implementing the cooperative medical care system can further demonstrate the great superiority of the people's communes' "one big, two public" principle.

3. This is the best way to revolutionize the medical and health workforce's ideology. Implementing the cooperative medical care system allows medical personnel to take the "barefoot doctor" path. They can honestly accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants in labor, struggle, study, and life together, thoroughly transform their worldview, and accelerate ideological revolutionization. This is also a good way to prevent and combat revisionism.

4. This is the best way to protect rural labor power. The "prevention-first" medical policy can truly be implemented, and the rural health situation will be fundamentally improved, and people's physical fitness will continue to improve.

Implementing the cooperative medical care system is an urgent desire of us poor and lower-middle peasants and "barefoot doctors." To ensure that this new thing grows vigorously, we believe the following points must be grasped:

1. Strengthen political and ideological work. In the process of promoting this system, due to the influence of old habits, some medical personnel may prescribe medicine based on the person. Some commune members may also have high expectations and specify which doctor to prescribe medicine. Therefore, it is necessary to address active thoughts and do regular political and ideological work to educate them to correctly treat the cooperative medical care system.

2. A large number of county and city medical personnel should be sent to the countryside. To achieve "minor illnesses do not leave the brigade, major illnesses do not leave the commune," urban medical personnel need to be significantly reduced and sent to the countryside. This is beneficial for the poor and lower-middle peasants to re-educate them and promote the ideological revolutionization of medical personnel. Their families can also go to the countryside to settle down. In the future, county-level hospitals only need to retain a small number of high-quality medical personnel to treat diseases that commune health centers cannot treat. The retained personnel should also take turns to participate in labor and accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

3. Strengthen the management of cooperative medical care funds. Based on the economic foundation and medical level of each team, determine the cooperative medical care fund for each person. Since the brigade is more familiar with the situation of the commune members, it is convenient to manage, so these funds should be concentrated in the brigade and managed and supervised by the brigade. Some teams with poor economic foundations may have overspending. If such a situation occurs, we believe that the commune's collective economy can provide necessary support.

### 开天辟地以来的大喜事

    开天辟地以来的大喜事
    东风浩荡，红旗如画。正当全国亿万军民学习、宣传、执行、落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务的时刻，《人民日报》发表了湖北省长阳县乐园人民公社实行合作医疗的重要报道，这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部对全国广大贫下中农最大的关怀，最大的爱护，也是对我们“赤脚医生”的最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。我们一千个拥护，一万个照办，让我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！实行合作医疗制度，这是开天辟地以来贫下中农从来没有过的大喜事。过去贫下中农连做梦也不敢想的事，今天毛主席他老人家为贫下中农实现了，毛主席真是贫下中农的大恩人。
    我们是在毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的光辉指示指引下成长起来的、既参加生产劳动又为贫下中农防病治病的“赤脚医生”。我们认为，实行合作医疗制度的意义是极其深远的，它的好处是：一、解决了医疗卫生工作为谁服务的根本问题。医疗卫生工作为谁服务？在这个问题上，十几年来一直存在着两条路线的激烈斗争。长期以来，刘少奇及其在卫生战线的代理人，极力推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，他们把医院建设在远离农村的城镇，把大批医生留在城市大楼里，为城市少数人服务，广大贫下中农则长期处于缺医少药的状况。合作医疗制度的实行，就能够从根本上改变上述不合理的状况，保证农村医疗卫生工作真正为广大贫下中农服务。二、实行合作医疗制度，就能进一步体现人民公社一大二公的巨大优越性。三、这是医疗卫生队伍思想革命化的最好途径。实行合作医疗制度，医务人员走“赤脚医生”道路，能够在和贫下中农同劳动、同战斗、同学习、同生活中老老实实接受贫下中农再教育，彻底改造世界观，加速思想革命化。这也是改变医院知识分子成堆，防修反修的好办法。四、这是保护农村劳动力的最好办法。“预防为主”的医疗方针能够真正得到落实，农村卫生面貌将会得到彻底改善，人民体质将会不断增强。
    实行合作医疗制度是我们贫下中农和“赤脚医生”的迫切愿望。为了使这一新生事物茁壮成长，我们认为必须抓好以下几点：
    一、切实加强政治思想工作。在推行这一制度的过程中，由于受旧的习惯势力的影响，有的医务人员可能会看人配药。也有的社员可能有过高要求，指定医生配药。为此，必须针对活思想，做好经常性的政治思想工作，教育他们要正确对待合作医疗制度。
    二、县市医务人员应当大量下放到农村。为了做到“小病不出大队，大病不出公社”，城市里的医务人员要大量精简下放。这样有利于贫下中农对他们进行再教育，促进医务人员的思想革命化。他们的家属也可以下乡插队落户。今后县级医院只需留下少而精的医务人员，医治公社卫生院不能医治的疾病。留下的人员也要分批参加劳动，接受贫下中农的再教育。
    三、加强合作医疗基金的管理。根据各队的经济基础和医疗水平，确定每人的合作医疗基金。因为大队对社员的情况比较了解，便于掌握，因此，这些基金集中在大队，由大队统一核管和分级管理。有的队经济基础较差，可能会出现超支，如果遇到这种情况，我们认为公社大集体经济可以进行必要的支持。
