The theory of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat is the essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Whether to engage in class struggle and whether to uphold or oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat has always been the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on the one hand and revisionism on the other, and the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones.

The great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi has been vigorously advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." After the nationwide victory, he falsely claimed that "imperialism, the Kuomintang, and bureaucratic capitalism have either fled or been eliminated, and no longer exist." Later, he advocated that "the bourgeoisie has basically been eliminated by us," and that "the main classes and class struggles within the country have basically ended." In short, he claimed that classes and class struggles no longer exist. This is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary and revisionist fallacy.

Since the division of classes in human society, there has not been a moment without fierce class struggle between the exploited and the exploiters. As long as classes and class contradictions still exist in the world, class struggle will never extinguish.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" that after the nationwide victory, the fundamental contradiction in China is "the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie." "The state power of the People's Republic led by the working class must be strengthened, not weakened, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution." This is an unshakable great truth.

After the proletariat seizes power, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie does not end. On the contrary, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the proletariat must resist and defend against the aggression and subversion of imperialism; internally, it must suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and eliminate all systems of exploitation and bourgeois ideology. This struggle is more acute, more complex, and more profound than fighting against armed enemies. The center of the struggle remains the issue of power. The proletariat must consolidate and strengthen the power it has seized, while the overthrown bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes still exist, their hearts are not dead, and they are constantly scheming to restore their lost "paradise." Under socialist conditions, the bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, not only through open and brazen means, but more often through "the policy of Sun Wukong entering the belly of the Iron Fan Princess to cause trouble." They are constantly looking for their agents within our party and government organs. Once the leadership of the party and the government becomes corrupted, the party will turn revisionist, and the country will change color. After the proletariat seized power in the Soviet Union, it did not take effective anti-revisionist and anti-revisionist measures, and the power was usurped by the Soviet revisionist clique. They betrayed Marxism-Leninism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, turning the first socialist country in the world, founded by Lenin, into a country where capitalism was fully restored and degenerated into social imperialism. This is a painful lesson.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was exposed that the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, represented by Liu Shaoqi, represented the interests of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and attempted to restore capitalism in China. For a long time, Liu Shaoqi openly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and vigorously advocated the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," attempting to lull the revolutionary will of the proletariat, so that Liu Shaoqi and his clique of capitalist roaders within the party could launch a ferocious attack on the proletariat and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. This in itself is a very acute class struggle.

Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices maliciously attacked and slandered the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought, defaming the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as "formalism," "vulgarization," and "simplification," and opposing the broad revolutionary masses from studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices used various means to sabotage socialist revolution and socialist construction, vigorously developing capitalist forces in cities and countryside, attempting to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices took advantage of the bourgeoisie's dominance in the cultural sector, using the leadership positions they had seized in academia, education, news, literature and arts, publishing, science, and other fields, to impose bourgeois dictatorship and bourgeois liberalization, opening the door wide for poisonous weeds and ghosts and monsters to emerge. They filled our newspapers, radio, periodicals, books, novels, poetry, films, drama, music, and art with the black goods of feudalism, bourgeoisie, and revisionism, such as emperors, ministers, generals, talents, and beauties, attempting to poison and corrupt the proletariat and revolutionary masses with the most reactionary and decadent bourgeois ideology and culture, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The proletariat must develop socialist culture, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve proletarian politics, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, seeks to develop bourgeois and revisionist culture, serve the bourgeoisie, and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. In the ideological realm, class struggle is intense and has never stopped.

Many shocking facts eloquently demonstrate that class struggle has not ended, and under socialist conditions, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are still engaged in a life-and-death class struggle. The loyal running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, advocates the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," which is completely a distortion of right and wrong, black and white. Its purpose is to use this smokescreen to cover up his and the bourgeoisie's evil activities of attacking the proletariat.

Proletarian revolutionaries must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," and thoroughly criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." While we are carrying out the socialist revolution on the political and economic fronts, we must also continue to carry out the socialist revolution on the ideological front to the end, in order to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and build socialism. We resolutely respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's battle call for the proletariat to impose comprehensive dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure, including all cultural fields, to occupy the political stage of the superstructure, and to ensure that our proletarian state will never change color.

### 批臭“阶级斗争熄灭论”　念念不忘无产阶级专政

    批臭“阶级斗争熄灭论”　念念不忘无产阶级专政
    海直机关　蓝桂良
    阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的精髓。搞不搞阶级斗争，坚持还是反对无产阶级专政，从来就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同修正主义的分水岭，是区别真革命还是假革命的试金石。
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”。在全国胜利后，他胡说什么“帝国主义、国民党、官僚资本主义，有的跑掉了，有的被消灭了，没有了”。以后，他又鼓吹“资产阶级也基本上被我们消灭了”，“国内的主要阶级和阶级斗争已经基本结束了”。一句话，阶级和阶级斗争都没有了。这是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义谬论。
    自从人类划分阶级以来，一刻也没有停止过被剥削阶级同剥削阶级的激烈的阶级斗争。只要世界上还存在阶级和阶级矛盾，阶级斗争就绝对不会熄灭。
    伟大领袖毛主席早在《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》中，就给我们明确指出：在全国胜利后，中国国内的基本矛盾，是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。“工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化。”这是颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    在无产阶级夺取政权后，无产阶级同资产阶级之间的阶级斗争并没有结束。相反的，在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级对外要抵抗和防御帝国主义的侵略和颠覆活动；在国内要镇压资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的反抗，要消灭一切剥削制度和资产阶级思想。这种斗争比同拿枪的敌人作斗争更加尖锐、更加复杂、更加深刻。斗争的中心，仍然是政权问题。无产阶级要巩固和加强已经夺得的政权，而被推翻的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级人还在，心不死，千方百计地梦想恢复他们已经失去的“天堂”。在社会主义条件下，资产阶级想推翻无产阶级专政，除了采取公开的明目张胆的办法外，更多的是“采用孙行者钻进铁扇公主肚子里兴妖作怪的政策”。他们千方百计在我们党政机关中寻找他们的代理人。党和政权的领导一变质，党就会变修，国家就会变色。苏联在无产阶级夺得政权后，没有采取有效的反修、防修措施，被苏修叛徒集团篡夺了政权。他们背叛马克思列宁主义，背叛无产阶级专政，使列宁亲自缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家，出现了资本主义全面复辟，蜕变成社会帝国主义。这是一个沉痛的教训。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中被揭露出来的、以刘少奇为代表的党内一小撮走资派，他们代表着帝国主义和国民党反动派的利益，妄想在中国复辟资本主义。长期以来，刘少奇明目张胆地反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，妄图麻痹无产阶级的革命斗志，以便刘少奇同他一伙党内的走资派，向无产阶级发动猖狂进攻，颠覆无产阶级专政。这本身就是十分尖锐的阶级斗争。
    刘少奇及其同伙，恶毒地攻击和诽谤当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，污蔑广大工农兵活学活用毛泽东思想是“形式主义”、“庸俗化”、“简单化”，反对广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想。
    刘少奇及其同伙，运用各种手段千方百计地破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设，竭力发展城乡资本主义势力，妄图实现资本主义复辟。
    刘少奇及其同伙，利用资产阶级在文化部门的优势，利用他们所窃取的学术、教育、新闻、文艺、出版、科学等阵地的领导权，大搞资产阶级专政，大搞资产阶级自由化，为毒草、为牛鬼蛇神出笼大开绿灯，大发“通行证”。他们让帝王将相、才子佳人等封、资、修的黑货，塞满了我们的报纸、广播、刊物、书籍、小说、诗歌、电影、戏剧、音乐、美术等一切文化领域的各个角落，妄图用最反动、最腐朽的资产阶级思想和文化来毒害、腐蚀无产阶级和革命群众，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    无产阶级要发展社会主义的文化，为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为巩固和加强无产阶级专政服务。资产阶级则要发展资产阶级、修正主义的文化，为资产阶级服务，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。在意识形态领域里，阶级斗争十分剧烈，一刻也没有停息过。
    许多惊心动魄的事实雄辩地说明，阶级斗争并没有结束，在社会主义条件下，无产阶级同资产阶级还在进行着你死我活的阶级大较量。帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，完全是颠倒黑白、混淆是非，其目的就是要用这种烟幕弹来掩护他和资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的罪恶活动。
    无产阶级革命战士一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，彻底批判“阶级斗争熄灭论”。我们在进行政治战线和经济战线的社会主义革命的同时，还必须继续把思想战线的社会主义革命进行到底，才能巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义。我们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级必须在上层建筑其中包括各个文化领域中对资产阶级实行全面的专政的战斗号令，去占领上层建筑的政治舞台，保证我们无产阶级的江山永不变色。
