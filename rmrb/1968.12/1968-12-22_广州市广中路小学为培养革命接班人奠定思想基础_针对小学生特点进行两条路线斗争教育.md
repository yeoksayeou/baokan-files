Guangzhou's Guangzhong Road Primary School, with the help of workers and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the school, has conducted education on the struggle between the two lines in a way that is simple and easy to understand, tailored to the characteristics of primary school students. This ensures that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line takes root in their young hearts.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly explained. It is not enough to explain it to a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," was issued, the school's revolutionary committee mobilized revolutionary teachers to study how to educate students on the struggle between the two lines. Some teachers thought that the students were too young and were hesitant to conduct such education. The revolutionary committee, with the help of the workers and the PLA propaganda team stationed at the school, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and raise their awareness. Through study, the revolutionary teachers realized that educating primary school students on the struggle between the two lines is a major task for laying the ideological foundation for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. If they shied away from this task, it would be disloyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, everyone began to conduct education on the struggle between the two lines tailored to the characteristics of primary school students.

Primary school students were born under the red flag and grew up in a sweet environment, loving the great leader Chairman Mao. However, they do not know the suffering of the working people in the old society. In response to this situation, the revolutionary committee and the propaganda team launched extensive "remember bitterness, think sweetness" activities in the school. In addition to inviting old workers and poor peasants from outside the school and the propaganda team stationed at the school to share their family histories, factory histories, and village histories, they organized students to visit factories and rural class education exhibitions and to eat bitter meals. They also encouraged children of workers and peasants to ask about their family histories at home and then share them at school, further arousing their deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and helping them better accept education on the struggle between the two lines. Eight-year-old worker's son Zheng Zhengguo was once very naughty. During this "remember bitterness, think sweetness" activity, when he talked about his mother being sold from Wenzhou to Guangzhou three times by the evil landlord in the old society, he cried and said, "Mom said I forgot my roots. Forgetting my roots is disloyal to Chairman Mao. From now on, I will listen to Chairman Mao's words and be a little red soldier defending Chairman Mao."

In educating primary school students on the struggle between the two lines, the propaganda team and teachers often introduced Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices and the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the students, using vivid facts and simple language to explain that the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. At the same time, they organized students to link theory with practice, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. For example, during a "daily criticism" session in the fourth grade, they exposed and criticized a bad element who had infiltrated the revolutionary teachers' ranks and persisted in a reactionary landlord stance. The little red soldiers used their own bitter family histories to strongly denounce this bad element's crimes of exploiting and oppressing the working people before liberation, effectively criticizing Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." In fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, they linked it to the old educational system and old textbooks for criticism. After studying Chairman Mao's brilliant directive "The people's commune is good," the little red soldiers in Class 4 of the fourth grade flipped through the old textbook "Grow melons and beans in front of and behind the house" and criticized it, saying: "Turning the land in front of and behind the house into private plots is promoting Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. We will not be fooled! For younger students, teachers used cartoons to draw Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes and explained them based on the content of the drawings.

Through repeated and in-depth education on the struggle between the two lines, students' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines continues to improve, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has taken root in their young hearts.

    广州市广中路小学为培养革命接班人奠定思想基础
    针对小学生特点进行两条路线斗争教育
    据新华社广州二十一日电　广州市广中路小学革命委员会，在驻校工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，根据小学生的特点，深入浅出地进行两条路线斗争教育，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在他们的幼小心灵中扎根。
    伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表以后，校革委会发动革命教师，研究如何对学生进行两条路线斗争的教育。有些教师认为学生年纪小，对向学生进行两条路线斗争教育有畏难情绪。革委会针对这种活思想，在驻校工人、解放军宣传队帮助下，组织大家学习毛主席著作，提高认识。通过学习，使革命教师认识到，对小学生进行两条路线斗争教育，是为培养无产阶级革命事业接班人奠定思想基础的大事，如果在这个问题上见难而退，就是对毛主席无产阶级革命路线不忠。于是，大家便针对小学生的特点，对他们进行两条路线斗争的教育。
    小学生生在红旗下，长在甜水里，热爱伟大领袖毛主席。但是，他们不知道工农劳动群众在旧社会所受的苦。针对这种情况，革委会和宣传队就在校内广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，除请校外和驻校宣传队的老工人、老贫农讲家史、厂史、村史，并组织学生参观工厂、农村阶级教育展览及吃忆苦饭外，还发动工农子弟到家里问家史，回学校后自己讲述，进一步激发他们对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，更好地接受两条路线斗争的教育。八岁的工人儿子钟政国，过去很顽皮。在这次忆苦思甜活动中，当他讲到妈妈在旧社会被万恶的地主从温州三次卖到广州时，泣不成声地说：“妈妈说我忘了本，忘了本就是对毛主席不忠。今后，我要听毛主席的话，做保卫毛主席的红小兵。”
    在对小学生进行两条路线斗争教育时，宣传队和教师经常对学生介绍毛主席的伟大革命实践和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，用生动的事实和通俗的语言，向他们解释毛主席无产阶级革命路线的核心就是相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。与此同时，他们还组织学生联系实际，以毛泽东思想为武器，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线展开革命大批判。例如，在四年级的一次“天天批”中，就把学校里一个混进革命教师队伍、坚持反动地主立场的坏家伙揪出来批判斗争。红小兵们用自己辛酸的家史，强烈控诉了这个坏家伙解放前剥削压迫劳动人民的罪行，有力地批判了刘少奇鼓吹的“剥削有功”反动谬论。在狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线时，就联系旧教育制度、旧教材进行批判。四年级四班的红小兵学习了毛主席的“人民公社好”的光辉指示后，翻开“房前屋后，种瓜种豆”的旧课文批判说：把房前屋后的地都变成自留地，这是宣扬刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货，我们决不上当！对低年级学生，教师们就通过漫画形式，把刘少奇的反革命罪行画出来，根据画的内容，向他们讲述。
    通过反复、深入的两条路线斗争教育，使学生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在他们幼小的心灵中扎下了根。
