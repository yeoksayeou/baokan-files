	Wage Class Struggle in the Depths of the Soul
	Soldier Yin Chunxue

	Chairman Mao taught us in his report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee: "We must always maintain a humble, prudent, and unassuming attitude, and we must always maintain a spirit of hard struggle." At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, Chairman Mao's teachings hold great significance for every revolutionary comrade.

	After the proletariat seizes power, the bourgeoisie will always resort to two counter-revolutionary tactics to realize their plot of restoration: on the one hand, they will try every means to infiltrate; on the other hand, they will look for their agents within the revolutionary ranks. Therefore, after the revolutionary committees are established, if we do not constantly wage class struggle in the depths of our souls, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, we may be exploited by class enemies.

	After the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary leading group was established in the factory where we are supporting the left, some comrades developed the idea of taking a rest and wanted to "retreat to the camp." Some revolutionary masses pointed out this problem to us in time. However, the class enemies whom we had struggled against said: "Comrade X handles affairs prudently and is indeed a good comrade." Faced with these two completely different attitudes, I thought, why do class enemies flatter me? It turns out that they want to curry favor with me and lull me into complacency. This made me realize that the battle against selfishness and revisionism in my mind can never stop. If the "self" rises, peace and complacency will emerge, and power will be lost.

	The "self" in our minds always reflects class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Once, the factory received a new production task, but the equipment could not keep up, and it seemed impossible to complete it. At that time, three workers proposed technical innovation and the renovation of old equipment. Some people supported this idea, while others did not. When they sought my opinion, I also could not make up my mind. Later, following Chairman Mao's teachings, I went deep into the workshop, conducted an investigation, and firmly supported the workers' innovation. As a result, it only took two days for this reform to succeed, ensuring normal production. I thought, why was I unable to make a decision and dare not support the revolutionary opinions of the three workers at the beginning? The main reason was that I was afraid the workers could not do it, which would bring disgrace to the revolutionary committee; I was afraid that if something went wrong, I would also have to bear the responsibility. In short, it was the "self" that was causing trouble. This made me realize that if you retain even a bit of selfishness, you will fall behind Chairman Mao. Only by remembering the two "musts," constantly waging class struggle in the depths of the soul, finding and struggling against selfishness in the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, and constantly reforming your worldview, can you follow Chairman Mao closely and carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

    在灵魂深处进行阶级斗争
    战士　殷纯侠
    毛主席在七届二中全会的报告中教导我们：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利的时候，毛主席的这个教导，对于每一个革命的同志，都具有非常重要的意义。
    在无产阶级取得政权以后，资产阶级要实现其反革命复辟的阴谋，总要采取反革命的两手：一方面，千方百计地打进来；另一方面，在革命队伍里寻找他们的代理人。因此，革命委员会成立后，如果不在灵魂深处不断进行阶级斗争，破私立公，就有可能被阶级敌人利用。
    在我们支左的工厂里成立了“三结合”的革命领导小组以后，有的同志产生了歇一歇的思想，想
  “收兵回营”。有些革命群众及时地给我们指出了这个问题。但是，那些被我们揪斗过的阶级敌人，却说：“×代表办事稳重，不愧是个好同志。”在两种截然不同的态度面前，我想，为什么阶级敌人对我奉承呢？原来，他们是想讨好我、麻痹我。这使我警觉到，在头脑里斗私批修的仗永远不能停火。“私”字抬了头，产生和平麻痹思想，政权就会丢。
    我们头脑里的“私”字，总是伴随着阶级斗争和两条路线斗争反映出来。有一次，工厂接到了新的生产任务，设备跟不上，眼看完不成。当时，有三个工人提出搞技术革新，改造旧设备。这个意见，有些人支持，有些人不支持。征求我的意见，我也拿不定主意。后来，遵照毛主席的教导，深入车间，进行调查，坚决支持了工人闹革新，结果只花了两天时间，这项改革就成功了，保证了正常的生产。我想，开始的时候，为什么在两种思想、两条路线斗争中拿不定主意，不敢支持三个工人的革命意见呢？主要是怕工人搞不起来，给革委会脸上抹灰；怕出了差错，自己也要承担责任。一句话，就是私字在作怪。这使我体会到，私字留半分，就对毛主席跟不紧。只有牢记两个“务必”，不断地在灵魂深处进行阶级斗争，在两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中找私、斗私，不断改造世界观，才能紧跟毛主席，把社会主义革命进行到底！
