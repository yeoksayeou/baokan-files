The Nazi leader of Germany and the chief culprit of World War II, Hitler, has been dead for over twenty years, but his evil spirit still lingers, tightly clinging to the big and small successors of Hitler.

In West Germany, Hitler's "legacy," *Mein Kampf*, is reprinted edition after edition, swastika symbols appear everywhere, and the new Nazi Party is highly active. All of this is done with the encouragement and support of the U.S. occupation authorities. However, the U.S. imperialists still find this "not enough," and now they want to establish a "Hitler Museum" to erect monuments and biographies for this public enemy and butcher of the world. This is outrageously arrogant and utterly despicable.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no such thing as love without reason, nor is there such a thing as hatred without reason." It is no surprise that the heads of U.S. imperialism cherish Hitler. They have inherited Hitler's legacy, and in both domestic and foreign policies, they are following the same fascist path as Hitler. "Kindred spirits cherish each other," how can they not revere this ancestor and hold him in high regard?

The reason U.S. imperialism wants to establish a "Hitler Museum" is not just out of admiration for this fascist leader, but has a more sinister intention. This is to summon back Hitler's spirit, to incite revengeful sentiments in West Germany, and to let West German militarism "borrow a corpse to revive a spirit."

The shameless deeds of U.S. imperialism are a blatant provocation against the German people and a blatant provocation against all the peoples of the countries that once suffered savage invasions by fascist Germany. At the same time, it is a self-exposure by U.S. imperialism. From this incident, one can clearly see the blood relationship between the Washington ruling clique and Hitler.

The peoples of the world will one day establish a historical museum, placing the leaders of U.S. imperialism alongside Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo as eternal criminals, letting them be reviled for all eternity!

### “借尸还魂”

    “借尸还魂”
    德国法西斯的头目、第二次世界大战的祸首希特勒死去已二十多年了，但是他的阴魂至今未散，牢牢地依附在大大小小的希特勒继承者身上。
    在西德，希特勒的“遗著”《我的奋斗》一版再版，卐字徽到处出现，新纳粹党大肆活跃……。如此等等，都是在美国占领军当局纵容和鼓励之下搞起来的。然而，美帝国主义还嫌“美中不足”，现在又要建立“希特勒博物馆”，给这个世界人民的公敌、大刽子手树碑立传。真是猖狂万分，可恶之极。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”美帝的头子们厚爱希特勒，这是毫不奇怪的。他们继承了希特勒的衣钵，不论是在对内政策和对外政策方面都是搞的希特勒法西斯那一套。“惺惺惜惺惺”，他们对于这个祖师爷怎能不奉若神明，敬而仰之呢？
    美帝国主义之所以要给希特勒建立“博物馆”，并不仅仅是出于对这个法西斯头目的爱慕，而是有其更加阴险的用意。这就是想要招回希特勒的亡灵，在西德煽动复仇主义的情绪，让西德军国主义“借尸还魂”。
    美帝国主义的这种无耻行径，是对德国人民明目张胆的挑衅，是对一切曾经遭受法西斯德国野蛮侵略的各国人民明目张胆的挑衅。同时，它也是美帝国主义的一个自我暴露。人们从这件事情，可以清楚地看出华盛顿统治集团同希特勒的血缘关系。
    世界人民总有一天要建立起一个历史博物馆，把美帝国主义的头子们同希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机之流作为千古罪人摆在一起，让他们遗臭万年！
