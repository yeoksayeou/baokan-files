Recently, the capitalist world has once again been severely impacted by a financial crisis storm. In Western Europe and the United States, there has been a frenzy of selling francs, pounds, and dollars, and buying gold and West German marks. The imperialist countries are in a state of panic and chaos. This reflects that the financial and monetary system of the capitalist world is on the verge of collapse. This is a prominent manifestation of the deepening political and economic crisis led by the United States, and an important sign of the decline of the imperialist system.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The era we are in is one where the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an inescapable crisis." "The imperialist system is riddled with insurmountable contradictions." Currently, the worsening financial and economic crises in the imperialist countries are accelerating the process of the complete collapse of the entire imperialist system.

The recent financial crisis is a continuation of the financial storm that swept through the entire capitalist world this past spring. In this financial crisis, France's franc was the first to be hit, but what it exposed was far more than just the weakness of the franc's position and the deterioration of France's financial and economic situation. It revealed the critical condition of the capitalist monetary system, which is propped up by the dollar, and the worsening economic situation of the entire capitalist world. The franc crisis quickly spread to the dollar and the pound, fully illustrating this point. Since the financial crisis this spring, despite the various artificial measures taken by the United States, Britain, and other countries to temporarily ease the difficulties, they have not been able to truly improve the positions of the dollar and the pound, and the franc's position has become increasingly fragile. At the same time, the imperialist countries, in order to shift their difficulties onto others, have launched fierce currency wars and trade wars, causing severe turmoil in the capitalist world market, resulting in an even deeper financial crisis in the capitalist world.

The financial and economic crises in the imperialist countries are developing alongside political crises and are mutually reinforcing. In May and June of this year, large-scale mass struggles erupted in France and other capitalist countries in Europe and North America, delivering a severe blow to the capitalist economy. In particular, France's total production value decreased by tens of billions of dollars, the fiscal deficit grew rapidly, the trade deficit widened, and gold reserves were lost in large quantities, which were important causes of the franc crisis. This fact fully reflects the serious impact of the revolutionary mass movement on the international monopoly capitalist groups and the entire imperialist system. After the outbreak of this financial crisis, countries like Britain and France, in order to cope with the current difficult situation, have all taken so-called "austerity" and "economy" measures, which means cutting into the working people. This will inevitably provoke the resistance of the broad masses of the people, intensify class contradictions within these countries, and promote the deepening development of the revolutionary mass movement.

The outbreak of the financial crisis will also exacerbate the sharp and complex contradictions between imperialist countries. In order to avoid the complete collapse of the financial and monetary system of the entire capitalist world, the imperialist countries can make certain compromises with each other, but they always have ulterior motives and strive to find their own way out by harming others. They are sitting on a sinking ship and cannot avoid fighting each other. The emergency meeting of the finance ministers of ten countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany, held in Bonn after the outbreak of this financial crisis, was a farce of scheming and mutual arguments. The United States and Britain wanted the franc to devalue slightly, but France refused; the United States, Britain, and France wanted the mark to appreciate, but West Germany was unwilling to accept it. This ten-country finance ministers' meeting shows that the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries, as well as the contradictions within the European Common Market countries, have further sharpened. It can be predicted that the continued deterioration of the financial crisis will make the struggle between the imperialist countries to drown each other more intense, which will in turn further exacerbate the capitalist financial crisis and accelerate the decline of the imperialist system. This is an "vicious cycle" that imperialism cannot escape.

The financial and monetary crisis in the capitalist world is an inevitable result of the inherent contradictions of the imperialist system, and therefore it is an incurable disease. In our era, the entire imperialist system is already in its twilight years, gasping for breath. From Asia, Africa, and Latin America to Europe, North America, and Oceania, the world revolution is surging. The demise of imperialism is inevitable, and its days are numbered.

    无法克服的矛盾，不可解脱的危机
    本报评论员
    最近，资本主义世界再一次受到严重的金融危机风暴的猛烈冲击。西欧和美国的各个金融市场又刮起了一股抛售法郎、英镑和美元，抢购黄金以及西德马克的风潮。帝国主义各国惊慌失措，乱作一团。这反映了资本主义世界金融货币体系已经到了濒于土崩瓦解的地步。这是以美国为首的帝国主义政治经济危机急剧加深的突出表现，是帝国主义制度日益没落的重要标志。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服”。目前，帝国主义国家的金融危机和经济危机的恶性发展，正在加速整个帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的进程。
    最近爆发的这场金融危机，是今年春天席卷整个资本主义世界的金融危机风暴的继续。在这次金融危机的风暴中，法国的法郎首当其冲，但是它所暴露出来的，远远不仅是法郎地位的虚弱和法国财政经济状况的恶化，而是以美元为台柱的资本主义货币体系的病入膏肓和整个资本主义世界经济的每况愈下。法郎危机迅速波及美元、英镑，就充分说明了这一点。从今春的金融危机以来，尽管美英等国采取了种种人为措施，暂时度过难关，但是并没有能够真正改善美元和英镑的地位，而法郎的地位也越来越脆弱。同时，帝国主义各国为了转嫁困难，以邻为壑，展开激烈的货币战和贸易战，造成了资本主义世界市场的剧烈动荡，结果使得资本主义世界的金融危机更加深重。
    帝国主义国家的金融危机和经济危机，是伴随着政治危机一起发展的，并且是互相促进的。今年五、六月间在法国和欧洲、北美其他资本主义国家兴起的大规模群众斗争，给了资本主义经济以极其猛烈的冲击。特别是法国，它的生产总值减少几十亿美元，财政赤字急剧增长，对外贸易逆差扩大，黄金储备大量流失，这就是造成这次法郎危机爆发的重要原因。这个事实充分反映了革命群众运动大风暴对国际垄断资本集团和整个帝国主义制度的严重打击。而在这次金融危机爆发之后，英法等国为了应付当前的困难局面，都纷纷采取所谓“紧缩”和“节约”措施，也就是向劳动人民开刀。这样，又必然要激起广大人民群众的反抗，促进这些国家国内阶级矛盾的激化和革命群众运动的深入发展。
    金融危机的爆发，也必然要加剧帝国主义国家之间的尖锐复杂的矛盾。帝国主义国家为了避免整个资本主义世界金融货币体系的彻底垮台，相互之间可以作某些妥协，但它们总是各怀鬼胎，竭力用损人利己的办法来寻找自己的出路。它们坐在一条正在沉下去的破船上，仍然不可避免地要互相厮打。这次金融危机发生之后，美、英、法、西德等十国财政部长在波恩举行的紧急会议，就是一场勾心斗角、互相争吵的丑剧。美、英要法郎作小幅度的贬值，但法国不干；美、英、法要马克增值，西德又不肯接受。这次十国财长会议表明，美国和西欧国家之间的矛盾以及西欧共同市场国家之间的矛盾，都进一步尖锐化了。可以肯定，金融危机的继续恶化，必将使帝国主义各国互相要淹死对方的角斗更加剧烈，其结果又必然要进一步加剧资本主义金融危机，加速帝国主义制度的没落。这是帝国主义无法摆脱的一种“恶性循环”。
    资本主义世界金融货币危机，是帝国主义制度固有矛盾发展的必然结果，因此它是一种不治之症，在我们的时代，整个帝国主义制度已是日薄西山，气息奄奄了。从亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲到欧洲、北美和大洋洲，世界革命的洪流汹涌澎湃。帝国主义的灭亡是不可避免的，它的寿命是不长了。
