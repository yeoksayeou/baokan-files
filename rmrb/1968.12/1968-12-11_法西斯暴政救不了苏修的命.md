Recently, the Central Committee of the Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique jointly issued a decision to strengthen police rule, calling for "a series of measures" to "further strengthen the police force." At the same time, it has been continuously strengthening the military, prisons, courts, and other state apparatuses, intensifying the suppression of the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union. This fact starkly exposes the ferocious and savage nature of Soviet revisionist social fascism.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has always claimed to be a "state of the whole people" and a "party of the whole people." However, as class struggle in the Soviet Union intensifies, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's strengthening of suppression against the revolutionary people at home has made this cover-up increasingly thin and almost non-existent. Now, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique openly declares the strengthening of police rule, blatantly revealing its bloody bayonets and ruthlessly implementing fascist rule. This gang of traitors sitting on the heads of the Soviet people, while verbally erasing class struggle, is actually covering up the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat and the bourgeoisie's dictatorship over the proletariat.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether it is protection or suppression of the broad masses of the people, this is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's frenzied suppression of the people reflects the further sharpening of class contradictions and class struggle within the Soviet Union, reflecting the panic and unease of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique sitting on a volcano. This gang of traitors, while fully restoring capitalism at home, colludes with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries abroad, betrays the revolutionary interests of the people of the world, and pursues social imperialism, increasingly provoking the resistance of the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, in order to maintain its reactionary regime, will inevitably intensify fascism at home. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique is today implementing a full-fledged tyranny of the new tsars in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's frenzied suppression of the people does not indicate its strength but rather reveals its paper tiger nature and its predicament of being besieged both internally and externally. The Soviet revisionists' implementation of fascist tyranny will absolutely not save their lives but will only make the Soviet people see more clearly their reactionary class nature, provoking even more intense resistance from the Soviet people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state of the Soviet Union has now been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the people, the broad party members, and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and revolutionary. The rule of revisionism will not last long." The broad masses of the Soviet people will absolutely not allow this gang of revisionist traitors to continue to lord it over them for long. Recently, the revolutionary leaflets of the "Stalin Group" in the Soviet Union have already issued a call to arms to the Soviet people: "Overthrow the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie degeneration faction! Join the battle to rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union!" We firmly believe that the Soviet people will rise up to fight bravely, overthrow the fascist tyranny of the Soviet revisionists, and rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union.

    法西斯暴政救不了苏修的命
    最近，苏修叛徒集团的党中央和部长会议联名发布了强化警察统治的决定，叫嚷要“采取一系列措施”，“进一步加强民警”。同时它还不断地强化军队、监狱、法庭等其它的国家机器，加紧镇压苏联革命人民。这个事实，赤裸裸地暴露了苏修社会法西斯主义的青面獠牙的凶相。
    苏修叛徒集团一向标榜什么“全民国家”、“全民党”。可是，随着苏联国内阶级斗争的紧迫，苏修叛徒集团对国内革命人民镇压的加强，这片遮羞布早已越剪越小，所剩无几了。现在，苏修叛徒集团公然宣布加强警察统治，更是明晃晃地亮出了血腥的刺刀，赤裸裸地实行残暴的法西斯统治。这一伙骑在苏联人民头上的叛徒集团，口头上竭力抹煞阶级斗争，正是为了掩护资产阶级对无产阶级的进攻，掩护资产阶级对无产阶级的专政。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导说：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    苏修叛徒集团对人民群众的疯狂镇压，反映了苏联国内阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的进一步尖锐化，反映了坐在火山口上的苏修叛徒集团的惊恐不安。这一伙叛徒在国内全面复辟资本主义，在国外勾结美帝国主义和各国反动派，叛卖世界人民的革命利益，推行社会帝国主义，日益激起苏联广大革命人民的反抗。苏修叛徒集团为了维持它的反动政权，必然要在国内加紧法西斯化。苏修叛徒集团今天在苏联实行的是十足的新沙皇的暴政。
    苏修叛徒集团对人民群众的疯狂镇压，并不表明它的强大，恰恰表明了它的纸老虎的虚弱本质和它的内外交困的处境。苏修推行法西斯暴政，绝对救不了它的命，而只会使苏联人民更加看清它的反动阶级本质，激起苏联人民更加剧烈的反抗。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”苏联广大的人民绝不会容忍苏修这一伙叛徒长期地作威作福下去。不久前，苏联“斯大林小组”的革命传单已经向苏联人民发出了战斗的号召：“打倒资产阶级蜕化分子集团的专政！投身到重建苏联无产阶级专政的战斗中去！”我们坚决相信，苏联人民必将起来展开英勇的战斗，推翻苏修的法西斯暴政，重建苏联的无产阶级专政。
