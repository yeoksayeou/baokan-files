The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Students from old-style schools, most or many of them, can combine with workers and peasants; some of them have made inventions and innovations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers and peasants must give them re-education and thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers and peasants." In Xing Yanzi's hometown, Sijiazhuang Production Brigade in Baodi County, Hebei Province, the poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's instruction, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate urban youth sent to the countryside. They lead them in carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and further raising the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the urban youth.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Educate Urban Youth

Since 1964, Sijiazhuang Production Brigade has received fourteen urban youth from Tianjin. The poor and lower-middle peasants have great expectations for these youth. At the beginning, the brigade took meticulous care of their living conditions, arranging their food, housing, and daily necessities very carefully, but neglected their ideological education. The youth, just arrived in the countryside, found everything new and exciting and had a revolutionary enthusiasm; but after a few days, some of them became restless. Seeing this, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt that it was not enough to just take care of their living conditions. Old poor peasant Wang Wenhai said: "The youth from the city come to our countryside; this is the path indicated by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has entrusted the youth to us; this is the greatest trust the poor and lower-middle peasants have received. If we cannot do a good job, we will let Chairman Mao down!" Thus, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Sijiazhuang not only took care of the youth's living conditions but, more importantly, focused on their ideological education, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate them. Many old poor peasants and they studied and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Old Three Articles" and "The Direction of the Youth Movement" together, inspiring them to consciously change their thoughts. When some youth faced hard labor and felt afraid, the poor and lower-middle peasants educated them with their actual actions. During the winter water conservancy project, it was necessary to go into the water to dig mud. The north wind howled, and the water was cold and piercing. None of the youth dared to go into the water. Poor peasant member Wang Shiling led them in studying Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely carry out the decision, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and fearlessly went into the water to dig mud. Under the education of Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the youth were deeply moved and all went into the water to work.

Leading Urban Youth to Severely Criticize Liu Shaoqi

In the process of re-educating the urban youth, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Sijiazhuang Production Brigade, through investigation and analysis, saw that these youth were mostly children of the working people, and they voluntarily went to the countryside, indicating that they were willing to take the path of combining with workers and peasants. However, due to the poisoning of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, they had acquired some bourgeois ideas that looked down on workers and peasants.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution." The poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's teachings and used revolutionary criticism and struggle as an important method to re-educate the urban youth. They targeted the various active thoughts of the youth, guiding them to repeatedly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "studying to become an official," "merging public and private interests," and "labor as a decoration." They also seized on the fact that Liu Shaoqi's black henchman, counter-revolutionary revisionist element Zhou Yang, in 1964, came to Sijiazhuang Production Brigade to tempt the urban youth with ideas of fame and wealth, linking the upper and lower levels, guiding everyone to combine revolutionary criticism and struggle with eliminating the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in their own thoughts. This greatly aroused the urban youth's hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and their love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; their hatred for the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and their love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

In the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants also used their actual actions of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to influence and educate them. During the spring plowing and sowing, middle school student Cao Jianhua saw the villagers using their hands to grab manure, and she stretched out her hand and then pulled it back. Old poor peasant Wang Yongcheng smiled and said: "Don't be afraid of the smell of manure; we farmers cannot do without it. With it, we can produce more grain to support national construction." Saying this, he grabbed handfuls of it. Hearing the old poor peasant's words and seeing his actions, Cao Jianhua thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Comparing untransformed intellectuals with workers and peasants, one feels that intellectuals are not clean. The cleanest are still the workers and peasants, although their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are cleaner than the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." Chairman Mao's teaching struck at the key point in Cao Jianhua's thoughts, making her face burn with shame. In front of the old poor peasant, she finally realized that she had always thought she was cleaner than the peasants, but in fact, the cleanest were the poor and lower-middle peasants who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and the dirtiest were the bourgeois ideas she had acquired.

Conducting Class Education for Urban Youth

Chairman Mao said: "Many young people, due to lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing old China with new China, and it is not easy for them to deeply understand how our people have experienced countless hardships to struggle free from the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and how to build a beautiful socialist society through long-term arduous labor." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Sijiazhuang, following Chairman Mao's teachings, regarded class education as a main course in re-educating the urban youth. Many poor peasants with deep hatred and bitterness often told them the village history and family history, using class bitterness and national hatred to awaken their class consciousness.

In daily life, the poor and lower-middle peasants did not miss any opportunity to conduct class education. Once, a few urban youth casually threw away their dirty and torn clothes and shoes. Old poor peasant Wang Grandma saw this and felt pain in her heart. She gathered these clothes and shoes, washed and mended them, and sent them back to the youth. She pointed to these mended clothes and shoes and said earnestly: "In the old society, we poor people had to work hard and beg for food, and we could not wear such clothes and shoes even in a whole year. Now, Chairman Mao has brought happiness to us poor and lower-middle peasants. You doing this is disloyal to Chairman Mao and also disloyal to the poor and lower-middle peasants!" The youth took the clothes and shoes mended by Grandma with both excitement and shame. They studied Chairman Mao's works over and over again, deeply realizing that their thoughts and feelings were far from those of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They sighed: "We did not throw away a few pieces of clothing and a few pairs of shoes, but we threw away revolutionary thoughts and proletarian feelings; Grandma not only mended our clothes but also mended the poor and lower-middle peasants' noble qualities of diligence and thrift."

In class education, the poor and lower-middle peasants also followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," using the reality of class struggle as a living textbook, constantly strengthening the urban youth's awareness of class struggle. Once, an urban youth and a rich peasant's daughter went to the market together. On the way, the rich peasant's daughter pointed to a piece of wheat and said: "This piece of land used to belong to our family." At that time, the urban youth did not pay much attention to this statement. Later, through the old poor peasants' education, she finally realized that the landlords and rich peasants still wanted to change the sky! They wanted their children to firmly remember the "change of sky" account. The reality of class struggle gave the urban youth a vivid class education lesson, making them see clearly and raising their awareness of class struggle.

    贫下中农对下乡知识青年进行再教育
    宝坻县司家庄大队贫下中农带领下乡知识青年，活学活用毛泽东思想，开展革命大批判，提高他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了思想革命化
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”邢燕子的家乡河北省宝坻县司家庄大队的贫下中农，遵照毛主席的这一教导，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对从城市到农村落户的知识青年进行再教育，带领他们深入开展革命大批判，狠批刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线，进一步提高了知识青年的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    用毛泽东思想教育知识青年
    司家庄大队从一九六四年以来，先后接收了十四名天津市的下乡知识青年。贫下中农对这些知识青年寄予很大希望。一开始，队里从生活上无微不至地关怀他们，把吃的、住的、用的都安排得十分周到，但对思想教育则有所忽视。知识青年刚到农村，处处都感到新鲜，有一股革命热情；可是，没过几天，有的青年就不安心了。广大贫下中农看到这种情况，深深感到，光从生活上关怀照顾他们是不行的。老贫农王文海说：“知识青年从城里来咱乡下，这是毛主席指引的道，毛主席他老人家把青年交给了咱，这是对咱贫下中农的最大信任，咱要带不好，可对不起毛主席啊！”于是，司家庄的贫下中农不仅对知识青年从生活上照顾，更重要的是大抓思想教育，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想对他们进行再教育。许多老贫农和他们一起活学活用“老三篇”、《青年运动的方向》等毛主席的光辉著作，启发他们自觉地改造思想，并以邢燕子的先进事迹，对他们进行活的教育。有的知识青年在艰苦的劳动面前有点害怕，贫下中农就用自己的实际行动教育他们。在冬季兴修水利时，需要下水挖泥。北风呼啸，水凉刺骨，知识青年谁也不敢下水。贫农社员王世伶就一边带着他们学习毛主席教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一边毫不畏惧，下水挖泥。在毛泽东思想的教育下，在贫下中农的带动下，知识青年们深受感动，都纷纷下水干了起来。
    带领知识青年狠批刘少奇
    司家庄大队贫下中农在对知识青年进行再教育的过程中，通过调查分析，看到这些知识青年大都是劳动人民的子女，他们自觉地下乡，说明他们愿意走与工农兵相结合的道路。但是，由于这些知识青年过去受到刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，沾染了一些轻视工农兵的资产阶级思想。
    毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”贫下中农遵循毛主席的教导，把革命大批判作为对知识青年进行再教育的重要方法。他们针对知识青年的各种活思想，引导青年反复批判了刘少奇的“读书做官”、“公私溶化”、“劳动镀金”等反革命修正主义谬论，并抓住刘少奇的黑干将、反革命修正主义分子周扬在一九六四年到司家庄大队用名利思想引诱知识青年的罪恶事实，上批下联，引导大家把革命大批判同肃清反革命修正主义教育路线在自己思想上的影响结合起来，使知识青年进一步认识到，毒在自己心上，根在大叛徒刘少奇及其代理人身上。这样，大大激发了知识青年痛恨反革命修正主义教育路线，热爱毛主席的革命路线；痛恨大叛徒刘少奇，热爱伟大领袖毛主席的阶级感情。
    在革命大批判中，贫下中农还用自己无限忠于毛主席革命路线的实际行动，影响教育他们。在春耕播种时，中学生曹建华一看社员用手抓粪，伸出来的手又缩了回去。老贫农王永成笑着说：“你别看粪臭，咱庄稼人可离不了它，有它就能多打粮食，支援国家建设。”说着，就一把一把地抓起来。听了老贫农的话，看了老贫农的行动，曹建华想起了毛主席的教导：“拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”毛主席的教导，击中了曹建华思想上的要害，使她脸上火辣辣的，在老贫农面前，她才认识到，以前总觉得自己比农民干净，其实，最干净的是无限忠于毛主席的贫下中农，最脏的恰恰是自己沾染上的资产阶级思想。
    对知识青年进行阶级教育
    毛主席说：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，而建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过怎样的长时间的艰苦劳动。”司家庄的贫下中农，遵照毛主席的教导，在对知识青年进行再教育中，把阶级教育当作一门主课。许多苦大仇深的老贫农，经常给他们讲村史、忆家史，用阶级苦、民族恨启发他们的阶级觉悟。
    在日常生活中，贫下中农也不放过任何进行阶级教育的机会。有一次，几个知识青年把穿破了的脏衣服和鞋子顺手扔了。老贫农王大娘，看在眼里，痛在心头。她把这些衣服和鞋子，搜罗到一块，刷洗干净，缝补好，给知识青年送去。她指着这些补过的衣服和鞋子，语重心长地说：“旧社会，咱穷人扛活要饭，一年到头也穿不上这样的衣服和鞋子。如今，毛主席给咱贫下中农带来了幸福，你们这样做对不起毛主席，也对不起贫下中农啊！”青年们接过大娘亲手给补好的衣服和鞋子，又激动，又惭愧。他们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席著作，深深认识到自己的思想感情和贫下中农相差太远了。他们感慨地说：“我们丢掉的不是几件衣服，几双鞋，而是丢了革命的思想，丢了无产阶级的感情；贫农老大娘不光是给我们补了衣服，更是给我们补了贫下中农勤劳俭朴的高贵品质。”
    在阶级教育中，贫下中农还遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，以阶级斗争的现实为活教材，不断增强知识青年的阶级斗争观念。有一次，一个知识青年和富农的女儿一块去赶集，走在半路上，这个富农的女儿指着一块麦子说：“这块地早先是我们家的。”当时，这个知识青年对这句话并没有介意。后来，通过老贫农的教育，她才恍然大悟，原来地主富农还妄想变天！还要叫他们的子女牢牢记住“变天账”。现实的阶级斗争，给知识青年们上了一堂生动的阶级教育课，使他们擦亮了眼睛，提高了阶级斗争观念。
