Workers in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Bolivia have recently launched a new wave of struggles against oppression and exploitation.

In Argentina, the sugar industry workers of Tucumán, known for their fighting spirit, held a street demonstration in Tucumán City on December 3 with over 1,500 participants. The workers strongly protested against the factory owners' tactics of delaying wage payments and laying off workers. On December 4, workers from the Arnao sugar factory in Villa Ocampo, Santa Fe Province, also held a demonstration in front of the local government building to protest against delayed wages. On the same day, workers and employees of the "Global" winery in Mendoza Province occupied the factory to protest against long-overdue wages.

In Chile, nearly 7,000 workers and employees in the railway, mining, and metallurgical industries held partial or indefinite strikes from December 7 to 11. They protested against the exploitation by monopolies and demanded wage increases.

Uruguayan workers, who have been continuously fighting against wage freezes and "emergency security measures" this year, have held 33 strikes in the capital Montevideo in recent days. Previously, printers held a 48-hour strike.

In Bolivia, miners of the Japanese-controlled Mitsui Mining Company began an indefinite strike in late November, strongly protesting against the company's refusal to meet their legitimate demands.

The strike struggles of workers in Argentina, Chile, and other countries are powerful responses to the brutal exploitation by U.S. imperialism and domestic monopolies. Under the plundering of U.S. imperialism, the currencies of these countries have continuously depreciated, and prices have continuously risen. Taking Chile as an example, by the end of November this year, the currency had depreciated more than 20 times, and prices had risen by 28.5%. According to reports, the number of strikes by Chilean workers protesting against the brutal exploitation of monopolies by the end of November this year has far exceeded the total for the entire previous year.

    反对美帝和本国垄断资本的残酷剥削
    拉丁美洲各国工人掀起斗争新浪潮
    阿根廷工人示威　智利、乌拉圭、玻利维亚工人不断罢工
    新华社十二日讯 阿根廷、智利、乌拉圭、玻利维亚的工人，最近又掀起反对压迫和剥削的斗争浪潮。
    在阿根廷，具有斗争传统的图库曼糖业工人，十二月三日在图库曼市举行了有一千五百多人参加的街头示威。工人们强烈抗议工厂主用拖欠工资、裁减工人等手段残酷压榨工人。圣菲省比利亚奥坎博市阿尔诺糖厂的工人，十二月四日也在当地市政府大楼前举行示威，抗议工厂主拖欠工资。门多萨省“环球”酿酒厂的工人和职员在十二月四日曾占领了厂房，反对资方长期欠付工资。
    在智利，铁路、矿业、冶金工业等系统的近七千名工人和职员，从十二月七日到十一日连续举行局部性罢工或不定期罢工，抗议垄断资本对工人的压榨，要求提高工资。
    今年以来连续开展大规模斗争反对冻结工资和“紧急安全措施”等反动政策的乌拉圭工人，最近几天在首都蒙得维的亚又举行了三十三次罢工。在此以前，印刷工人曾举行四十八小时罢工。
    玻利维亚由日本垄断资本控制的日东矿业公司的矿工，在十一月下旬开始举行无限期的总罢工，强烈抗议资方顽固拒绝工人们提出的正当要求。
    阿根廷、智利等国家工人的罢工斗争，是对美帝国主义等外国和本国垄断资本残酷剥削的有力反击。在美帝国主义的掠夺下，这些国家的货币不断贬值，物价不断上涨。以智利为例，到今年十一月底为止，货币已贬值二十多次，物价上涨了百分之二十八点五。据报道，智利工人为强烈抗议垄断资本的残酷剥削而进行的罢工斗争的人次，到今年十一月底就大大超过去年全年的数字。
