The news that neighbors Sun Guizhen and Gao Suzhen, who had been quarreling and feuding for three years, have reconciled, spread like wildfire through the two-line struggle history study classes on the streets. Everyone said, "Mao Zedong's revolutionary line has untied the knots in the hearts of these sworn enemies."

Sun Guizhen and Gao Suzhen, both over forty, are housewives living in Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County, Fuxin Town. Previously, they were both "deaf to the world outside their windows, focused only on household chores," and never participated in street study sessions or meetings.

Three years ago, Sun Guizhen accidentally damaged Gao Suzhen's sorghum fence while pushing a coal cart. A class enemy saw this as an opportunity to stir up trouble. He slipped into Gao Suzhen's house and fanned the flames: "Sun Guizhen is too much! She bullies the meek. What did your fence ever do to her? She's just picking on you because you're soft!" The troublemaker then slipped out of Gao Suzhen's house and into Sun Guizhen's, fanning the flames there too: "You've really done it now! You didn't hear her? The Gao woman has cursed your entire family for three generations! She's out to get you!"

This stirring up of trouble by the class enemy turned Gao Suzhen and Sun Guizhen into sworn enemies, cursing each other at every meeting.

Mao Zedong's latest directive, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It's not enough to tell just a few people; it must be known by the broad revolutionary masses," blew like a strong east wind through every street and into every home. With the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the residents' group established two-line struggle history study classes. Gao Suzhen and Sun Guizhen joined in with everyone else.

In the study classes, everyone used Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and the various facts of class struggle and two-line struggle in their own residents' group as their textbook, launching a revolutionary critique.

The sunlight and rain of Mao Zedong Thought nourished the hearts of Gao Suzhen and Sun Guizhen, these long-time sworn enemies. They opened their hearts to each other and thought alike. Gao Suzhen thought: Why did I treat a class sister as an enemy? It's because my awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle is not high! Sun Guizhen thought: Why did I treat a class enemy as a good person? It's because I haven't studied Mao Zedong Thought well!

Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Gao Suzhen and Sun Guizhen, along with the broad revolutionary residents, united as one and launched a new high tide of street struggle against the enemy.

    街道上的革命新风
    吵了三年架，赌了三年气的老邻居孙桂珍和高素清重新和好的事，一阵风似地吹遍了街道两条路线斗争史学习班。大家都说：“毛主席的革命路线，解开了冤家心里的死疙瘩。”
    四十多岁的家庭妇女孙桂珍和高素清，是辽宁阜新蒙古族自治县阜新镇的居民。以前，她俩“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只忙家务活”，街道上学习、开会从来不参加。
    三年前的一天，孙桂珍推煤不小心，手推车撞坏了高素清家的秫秸障子。一个阶级敌人瞅准这个进行挑拨离间的机会，便偷偷溜到高素清家兴邪风：“孙桂珍这娘们欺人太甚，见老实人就凶，你的障子害她啥事？纯粹是看你脑瓜皮好捏！”坏家伙从高素清家又溜出来，窜进孙桂珍家点鬼火：“你可惹了大祸！你没听听，姓高的娘们把你家祖辈三代都骂了！这不是成心和你过不去吗？”阶级敌人这一挑拨，高素清和孙桂珍见面就骂街，从此成了冤家对头。
    毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，象强劲的东风吹遍了条条街道，吹进了户户人家。在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，居民组办起了两条路线斗争史学习班，高素清和孙桂珍也随着大家进了学习班。
    在学习班上，大家以毛泽东思想为武器，以本居民组阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的种种事实为教材，展开了革命的大批判。
    毛泽东思想的阳光雨露滋润着高素清和孙桂珍的心田，这两个长年的冤家对头互相交了心，都想到一块儿去了。高素清想：为什么我拿阶级姐妹当仇人，这是因为阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟不高！孙桂珍想：为什么我拿阶级敌人当好人，这是因为我对毛泽东思想学得不好！
    在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，高素清和孙桂珍同广大的革命居民一起，团结一致，投入了街道对敌斗争的新高潮。
