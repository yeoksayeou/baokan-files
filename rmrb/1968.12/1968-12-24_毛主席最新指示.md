Chairman Mao's Latest Directive

It is very necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade city cadres and other people to send their children, who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, or college, to the countryside. We should mobilize them for this. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them.
