In the joyous days when the entire nation is celebrating the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and when the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are swiftly launching a great upsurge of learning, propagating, and implementing the plenum’s communiqué, the national press has reprinted Chairman Mao’s report to the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee. The important editorial by the two newspapers and one journal, “Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines Seriously,” has conveyed Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, which naturally led me to recall the fierce struggle between the two lines in Northeast China after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The struggle to clean out bandits and suppress local tyrants in North Manchuria was an important part of implementing Chairman Mao’s great directive to “build a solid Northeast base area.” The mobilization of the masses to clean out bandits and suppress local tyrants, and the building of a solid Northeast base area, were carried out under the correct leadership of Deputy Chairman Lin. However, every step forward in the revolution is not easy. At that time, we not only had to engage in arduous struggles against the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang and bandits but also had to wage extremely sharp and intense struggles within our party between the two lines. In this serious struggle concerning the fate and future of our country, it was Deputy Chairman Lin, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, who resolutely carried out Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, resisted, and finally smashed the right-opportunist capitulationist line pushed by Peng Zhen, the agent of Liu Shaoqi. This ensured the rapid implementation of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, the smooth progress of the struggle to clean out bandits and suppress local tyrants, the construction of a solid Northeast base area, and the great victory of the Northeast liberation war. Reflecting on the struggles I witnessed and personally experienced at that time, my love and loyalty to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line have been further deepened. My respect for Deputy Chairman Lin has been further strengthened. At the same time, my hatred for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents like Peng Zhen in the Northeast has been further intensified!

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Central Committee of the Party, led by the great leader Chairman Mao, dispatched a large number of cadres and troops to Northeast China to lead the people in further developing the revolutionary struggle. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the despot and traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who passively resisted Japan and actively opposed the Communists, curried favor with the enemy and sold out the country. Now, he arrogantly came down from the mountains of Emei to pick the fruits, attempting to seize the victory fruits won by our party leading the people through blood and sweat. With the aid of American imperialism, he played both reactionary hands, using the pretext of “peace” to carry out the counterrevolutionary scheme of a full-scale civil war. He hurriedly sent troops by sea, land, and air to Northeast China, seizing key areas such as Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou, which had been liberated by our army, attempting to take advantage of our army’s unstable foothold in Northeast China. Relying on his superiority in troops and equipment, he aimed to annihilate our army in one stroke, occupy the entire Northeast, and then use the Northeast as an important base for launching a nationwide civil war, creating a situation of north-south pincer attack on our bases in North China, and further restoring his reactionary rule over the entire country. Therefore, the struggle in Northeast China at that time became the focal point of the struggle between our party and the army and the American-Chiang reactionaries, having particularly great significance for the development of the national situation.

At this critical moment, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao timely exposed the counterrevolutionary conspiracy of the American-Chiang reactionaries. On December 28, 1945, he issued the great call to the people of Northeast China to “build a solid Northeast base area.” Chairman Mao pointed out in his directive: “The current task of our party in Northeast China is to build a base area, to build solid military and political base areas in East Manchuria, North Manchuria, and West Manchuria. The focus of our party’s work in Northeast China is mass work. If we rely closely on the masses, we will overcome all difficulties and gradually achieve our goals.” On the issues of where to build the base area and how to build it, he provided us with a correct policy and pointed out a brilliant path. This is a great historical document, a general program for the political and military construction of Northeast China, and a great strategic deployment made by Chairman Mao to thoroughly smash the attacks of the Kuomintang reactionaries and liberate the entire country.

However, at that time, the counterrevolutionary revisionist elements like Peng Zhen, who had usurped key positions in Northeast China, fiercely resisted Chairman Mao’s wise directive. They spared no effort to push the counterrevolutionary line of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi, that is, the right-opportunist capitulationist line. In politics, they advocated class capitulationism, believed in negotiations, and fantasized about peace. In work deployment, they lingered in cities, did not want the countryside, and did not do meticulous mass work. In the military line, they pursued the bandit policy of “recruiting soldiers and buying horses,” surrendering and accepting traitors, forming cliques, and recruiting bandits, traitors, and scattered soldiers to expand their own strength. When the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale attack on Northeast China, they attempted to replace Chairman Mao’s strategic thinking and tactical principles with adventurism, hoping to take a gamble and engage in a decisive battle with the enemy in a situation where our army was at a disadvantage and had no rural base area.

At this critical moment concerning the future and fate of the Chinese revolution, Deputy Chairman Lin, the close comrade-in-arms of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely and bravely defended Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. He engaged in a struggle against the right-opportunist capitulationist line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents like Peng Zhen in the Northeast. Deputy Chairman Lin often instructed the cadre to not listen to any “peaceful democratic new stage” and not to convey it to the troops. He pointed out deeply that without the victory of the revolutionary war, peace is impossible. We do not yet have a base area in Northeast China, we do not yet have a home, cities are temporarily not ours, we can only treat them as hotels to stay temporarily. If we do not build rural base areas, we will not be able to defeat the enemy, we will be driven out by the enemy, and we may even starve to death or freeze to death. Deputy Chairman Lin always remembered Chairman Mao’s directive to “build a solid Northeast base area.” In thatched huts, under oil lamps, and on cold winter nights, he often sat in front of maps, pondering how to implement Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment. Whether in the midst of tense marches or during the intervals of fierce battles, whenever he arrived at a place, he personally organized the troops to carry out mass work on the spot, propagate the party’s policies, mobilize the masses to clean out bandits and suppress local tyrants, and establish revolutionary governments. In commanding battles, Deputy Chairman Lin resolutely followed Chairman Mao’s wise teachings, “open the main roads and occupy the flanks,” resolutely avoiding battles with the enemy under unfavorable conditions. To seek and create favorable opportunities to annihilate the enemy, he advanced and retreated in large strides, opened up cities, discarded burdens, concentrated superior forces, and annihilated the enemy in mobile warfare. In this way, despite the difficult conditions of lacking rear support in the early stages, we still continuously achieved victories in battles and campaigns, greatly delaying the enemy’s pace of attack, annihilating a large number of the enemy’s effective forces, and preserving ourselves.

From the winter of 1945 to the spring of 1946, although Deputy Chairman Lin had been persistently struggling to implement and defend Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, due to the support of the black master Liu Shaoqi, Peng Zhen and his ilk continued to insist on their errors and fiercely pushed the counterrevolutionary revisionist line. This delayed the implementation of Chairman Mao’s directive to “build a solid Northeast base area,” and the entire struggle against the enemy was in an extremely unfavorable situation. At that time, the fighting soldiers on the front lines could not be replenished, cities were lost one by one, and the countryside was occupied by bandits and traitors recruited by Peng Zhen and his ilk. When the Kuomintang attacked, these people revealed their true colors and joined the Kuomintang, becoming big and small “seat-mount tigers.” They harassed and disrupted our broad rear areas, oppressed the masses, sabotaged the construction of the base areas, and fiercely collaborated with the Kuomintang’s counterrevolutionary attacks. The cruel facts declared the complete failure of the counterrevolutionary capitulationist line of Liu Shaoqi and Peng Zhen and his ilk. The broad cadres at that time more clearly recognized the great wisdom of Chairman Mao’s directive to “build a solid Northeast base area.”

Dark clouds cannot obscure the sun, and fog cannot block the ship. At the critical moment when the struggle between the enemy and us in Northeast China and the struggle between the two lines within the party were extremely intense, our great commander Chairman Mao timely and decisively made a wise decision, removing the counterrevolutionary revisionist element Peng Zhen from his leading position in the Northeast Bureau and cutting off Liu Shaoqi’s claws extended to the Northeast region. From then on, the unified leadership of Deputy Chairman Lin in the Northeast region was established. In June and July 1946, Deputy Chairman Lin personally presided over an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Northeast China, thoroughly rectified the right-opportunist capitulationist line pushed by Peng Zhen, unified the understanding, policies, will, and steps of the entire party and army in Northeast China with Mao Zedong Thought, and produced the “July 7” resolution, which truly implemented Chairman Mao’s directive to “build a solid Northeast base area.” This resolution played a very important role in reversing the situation in Northeast China. Under the direct and correct leadership of Deputy Chairman Lin, several ten thousand cadres were quickly mobilized to go to the countryside and among the masses to carry out arduous and in-depth mass work, establishing the Northeast base area. According to Chairman Mao’s principle of “dividing forces to mobilize the masses and concentrating forces to deal with the enemy,” Deputy Chairman Lin dispersed a considerable part of the field army’s strength to military sub-districts to carry out work such as mobilizing the masses, eliminating bandits, and establishing governments. In this way, the face of Northeast China changed drastically within a few months. By the end of 1946, the poor peasants in the vast rural areas of Northeast China had all been mobilized, land reform had been carried out, the Kuomintang’s bandit forces had been eliminated, local armed forces of the people had been established, the main forces had been expanded, and the overall situation in Northeast China had fundamentally changed in our favor and against the enemy. Militarily, this quickly turned the strategic defense into a strategic counteroffensive, launching continuous and fierce attacks on the enemy, with each offensive being more powerful and each scale being larger, annihilating a large number of the enemy, making the enemy busy on all fronts, short of hands, and exhausted, collapsing and disorganized. In just over two years, we achieved the great victory of the Liaoshen Campaign, completely and thoroughly annihilating tens of thousands of Chiang’s bandit troops in Northeast China, liberating the entire Northeast. The liberation of the entire Northeast changed the military situation in the country significantly, as Chairman Mao pointed out in his article “The Great Change in China’s Military Situation” on November 14, 1948: “The military situation in China has now entered a new turning point, that is, the balance of power between the two sides of the war has fundamentally changed. The People’s Liberation Army not only has long been superior in quality but also now has the superiority in quantity.” This laid a solid foundation for overthrowing the Chiang regime and greatly accelerated the process of liberating the entire country. The victory of the Northeast War was a great victory of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, a great contribution made by Deputy Chairman Lin to the Chinese revolution, and a historical testimony to Deputy Chairman Lin’s unswerving loyalty to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. History has proven that Deputy Chairman Lin has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In every critical moment of the revolution, he executed Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line most resolutely, learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought best, and was the closest comrade-in-arms and best student of the great leader Chairman Mao. He is a shining example for the entire party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country to learn from.

    以林副主席为光辉榜样　无限忠于毛主席的革命路线
    回忆抗日战争胜利后东北地区的一段两条路线斗争的历史
    广州部队　阎仲川
    在全国亿万军民欢呼党的八届十二中全会公报发表的大喜日子里，在广大工农兵群众迅速掀起学习、宣传、落实全会公报的伟大高潮中，全国报刊重新发表了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告这篇光辉著作；两报一刊的重要社论：《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》，传达了毛主席的最新指示，使我很自然地联想到当年战火纷飞的东北战场。当时北满地区的清匪反霸斗争，是贯彻执行毛主席关于“建立巩固的东北根据地”伟大指示的一个重要组成部分。发动群众清匪反霸，建立巩固的东北根据地的斗争，是在林副主席的正确领导下进行的。但是，革命每前进一步，都是不容易的。当时，我们不但要同国民党反动军队和土匪进行艰苦的斗争，而且在我们党内，还存在着两条路线的极其尖锐激烈的斗争。在这一场关系我们国家的命运和前途的严重斗争中，是毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，抵制了并且最后粉碎了彭真所推行的刘少奇的右倾投降主义路线。这样，才保证了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的迅速落实，才有了清匪反霸斗争的顺利进行，才有了巩固的东北根据地的建设，才有了东北解放战争的伟大胜利。回想当年耳闻目睹和亲身经历的斗争事实，更进一步激发了我对毛主席革命路线的无限热爱，无限忠诚，进一步增强了我对林副主席的无限敬佩。同时，也更激起了我对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和他当时在东北的代理人彭真之流的无比仇恨！
    抗日战争胜利后，以伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央派遣了大批干部和部队进入东北，领导东北人民进一步开展革命斗争。在八年抗战中消极抗日、积极反共、媚敌卖国的独夫民贼蒋介石，这时却大摇大摆地从峨眉山上下来摘桃子，妄图攫取我党领导人民浴血奋战得来的胜利果实。他在美帝国主义援助下，大耍反革命的两手，在“和平”的幌子下，推行全面内战的反革命勾当。他急急忙忙从海陆空三路向东北大举运兵，抢占了已被我军解放的山海关、锦州等要地，妄图乘我军在东北立足未稳之际，凭借其在兵力和装备上的优势将我军一举消灭，霸占东北全境，然后把东北作为发动全国性内战的一个重要基地，造成对我华北各根据地南北夹攻的局势，从而进一步恢复其在全国的反动统治。因此，当时在东北的斗争，也就成了我党我军与美蒋反动派斗争的焦点，对全国局势的发展有着特别重大的意义。
    就在这一严重关头，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席及时地揭穿了美蒋反动派的反革命阴谋，于一九四五年十二月二十八日向东北军民发出了“建立巩固的东北根据地”的伟大号召。毛主席在指示中英明地指出：“我党现时在东北的任务，是建立根据地，是在东满、北满、西满建立巩固的军事政治的根据地。”“我党在东北的工作重心是群众工作。……如果我们紧紧依靠群众，我们就将战胜一切困难，一步一步地达到自己的目的。”对在什么地方建立根据地，以及如何建立根据地等一系列重大问题，给我们提出了一个正确的方针，指明了一条光辉的道路。这是一个伟大的历史文件，是在政治上、军事上建设东北的总纲领，是毛主席为彻底粉碎国民党反动派的进攻，为解放全中国作出的伟大战略部署。
    但是，当时在东北窃据要职的反革命修正主义分子彭真之流，却疯狂地对抗毛主席的英明指示，不遗余力地推行大内奸刘少奇的反革命路线，即右倾投降主义的路线。在政治上鼓吹阶级投降主义，迷信谈判，幻想和平；在工作部署上留恋城市，不要农村，不做艰苦细致的群众工作；在建军路线上，搞“招兵买马”的土匪政策，招降纳叛，结党营私，网罗土匪、汉奸、散兵游勇来扩充自己的实力。当国民党反动派向东北大举进攻的时候，他们则企图以冒险主义来取代毛主席的战略思想和战术原则，妄想在我军处于劣势又没有农村根据地的情况下，孤注一掷，冒险与敌人决战。
    在这关系到中国革命前途和命运的严重关头，我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，坚决地、勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在东北的代理人彭真之流所推行的右倾投降主义路线，进行了针锋相对的斗争。林彪同志经常谆谆教导部队干部，不要听信什么“和平民主新阶段”，不要向部队传达。他深刻地指出，没有革命战争的胜利，和平是不可能的。我们现在在东北还没有根据地，还没有家，城市暂时还不是我们的，我们只能把它当旅馆暂时住一住。我们不建设农村根据地，我们就无法战胜敌人，就会被敌人赶出去，甚至会饿死冻死。林彪同志总是念念不忘毛主席关于“建立巩固的东北根据地”的指示，在茅屋里，在油灯下，在寒风凛冽的长夜里，他经常面对着地图沉思，考虑着如何实现毛主席的伟大战略部署。无论在紧张的行军途中，在激烈战斗的间隙，每到一地，他都亲自组织部队就地开展群众工作，宣传党的政策，动员群众清匪反霸，建立革命政权。在指挥作战上，林彪同志坚决地按照毛主席的英明教导，“让开大路，占领两厢”，坚决避免在不利条件下与敌人作战；为了寻找和制造消灭敌人的有利战机，大踏步地前进与后退，让开城市，丢掉包袱，集中优势兵力，在运动战中各个歼灭敌人。就这样，在初期缺乏后方支援的艰难条件下，仍然不断地取得了战役和战斗的胜利，大大迟滞了敌人进攻的速度，大量消灭了敌人的有生力量，保存了自己。
    在一九四五年冬至一九四六年春，虽然林彪同志为执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线进行了坚持不懈的斗争，但是由于彭真之流在其黑主子刘少奇的支持下，仍然坚持错误，继续疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，使毛主席的“建立巩固的东北根据地”的指示迟迟不能落实，整个对敌斗争处于极端不利的境地。当时，前方奋战的将士得不到补充，城市一个个地丢失，农村则被彭真之流所收编的土匪和汉奸盘踞着。当国民党进攻的时候，这些家伙纷纷现出原形，投靠国民党，变成了大大小小的“座山雕”。他们在我军的广大后方骚扰捣乱，欺压群众，破坏根据地的建设，疯狂配合国民党的反革命进攻。无情的事实宣告了刘少奇、彭真之流的反革命投降主义路线的彻底破产。广大干部这时更加清楚地认识到毛主席关于“建立巩固的东北根据地”的指示无比英明。
    乌云遮不住太阳，迷雾挡不住航船。正当东北敌我斗争和党内两条路线斗争异常激烈的关键时刻，我们的伟大统帅毛主席及时地、果断地作出了英明的决定，撤消了反革命修正主义分子彭真在东北局的领导职务，斩断了刘少奇伸向东北地区的魔爪。从此，确立了林彪同志在东北地区的一元化领导。一九四六年六、七月间，林彪同志亲自主持召开了中共中央东北局的扩大会议，彻底清算了彭真所推行的刘少奇的右倾投降主义路线，用毛泽东思想统一了认识，统一了政策，统一了意志，统一了东北全党全军的步伐，产生了真正落实毛主席关于“建立巩固的东北根据地”指示的“七·七”决议。这个决议对扭转东北局势，起了非常重大的作用。在林彪同志直接的正确领导下，很快动员了几万干部下乡，到农村去，到群众中去，进行艰苦深入的群众工作，创建东北根据地。林彪同志根据毛主席“分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人”的原则，将野战军的相当一部分力量，分散到军分区去，从事发动群众、消灭土匪、建立政权等项工作。这样一来，几个月时间，东北面貌便焕然一新。到了一九四六年底，东北广大农村的贫苦农民便都发动起来了，实行了土地改革，肃清了国民党的土匪武装，建立了人民的地方武装，扩充了主力部队，使整个东北局势发生了有利于我不利于敌的根本变化。军事上，也因此迅速由战略防御转入战略反攻，向敌人连续开展了猛烈的进攻，攻势一次比一次凌厉，规模一次比一次扩大，歼灭了大量敌人，把敌人打得顾此失彼，捉襟见肘，疲于奔命，溃不成军。在两年多以后，我们就取得了威震中外的辽沈战役的伟大胜利，彻底干净地消灭了东北境内的几十万蒋匪军，解放了全东北。东北全境的解放，使全国军事形势发生了重大变化，正如毛主席一九四八年十一月十四日在《中国军事形势的重大变化》一文所指出的：“中国的军事形势现已进入一个新的转折点，即战争双方力量对比已经发生了根本的变化。人民解放军不但在质量上早已占有优势，而且在数量上现在也已经占有优势。”从而为推翻蒋家王朝奠定了坚实的基础，大大加快了解放全中国的进程。东北战争的胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是林副主席对中国革命作出的杰出贡献，也是林副主席无限忠于毛主席革命路线的历史见证。历史雄辩地证明，林副主席一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命的每一个紧急关头，执行毛主席的革命路线最坚决，对毛泽东思想学得最好，用得最活，林副主席是伟大领袖毛主席最亲密的战友和最好的学生，是全党全军全国人民学习的光辉榜样。
