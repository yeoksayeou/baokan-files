From salaries to work points: what does it signify?

The poor and lower-middle peasants of our production brigade, from the day we started running our own school in the second half of 1966, changed the salary system for teachers to a work points system.

On the surface, it seems that the change from teachers receiving salaries to work points is merely a change in the source of this expenditure, and some teachers went from receiving more money to receiving less. In reality, it is a fundamental change in the poor and lower-middle peasants taking control of the cultural and educational sphere. The purpose is to consolidate the proletarian educational front in the countryside. We believe that for the poor and lower-middle peasants to take control of the cultural and educational sphere, we need a corps of teachers who can maintain the character of the poor and lower-middle peasants and help them take power. In the past, some teachers who acted like "state cadres" and looked down on others, we could not control, did not like, and did not trust.

In our brigade, when the teachers' salaries were changed to work points, some people initially did not understand. We studied Chairman Mao's teachings with them: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power," and "In China, only the landlords have culture, while the peasants have none. But the culture of the landlords is created by the peasants, because the things that create the landlords' culture are not anything else, but the blood and sweat taken from the peasants." We organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and teachers to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, and to display the suffering of the Liao people under the oppression and exploitation of the landlords in the old society. In the old society, from children to the elderly, not a single person among the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Liao nationality could read, and they did not even know their own age. These bitter memories gave the teachers a great education. They said: We want revolution, not money. We will wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants and firmly support the poor and lower-middle peasants in taking control of cultural power. In this way, the primary school teachers implemented a system of half-day teaching and half-day labor. The teachers would go to the fields with hoes in the afternoon after teaching the students in the morning with their experiences from participating in the three great revolutionary practices. They are both good teachers and good commune members. They can farm with a hoe and criticize the bourgeoisie with a pen, becoming new-type intellectuals and becoming the confidants of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    从拿工资到记工分说明了什么？
    我们大队黎族贫下中农，从一九六六年下半年自己办学的第一天起，就把教员的工资制改成了工分制。
    教员从拿工资到记工分，表面上看，似乎只是这笔开支从那里出的变化，有些教师从拿钱多到拿钱少的变化，但实际上是贫下中农掌握文教大权的根本变化，目的在于巩固农村无产阶级教育阵地。我们认为，贫下中农要掌握文教大权，就需要一支能够保持贫下中农本色的、能够帮助贫下中农掌权的教师队伍。过去一些摆着“国家干部”架子，高高在上的教师，我们管不着，看不惯，也不放心。
    我们队里的教师由工资制改成记工分，最初有的人想不通。我们就和他们一起学习毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”，“中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。”我们组织贫下中农和教师一起忆苦思甜，大摆黎族人民过去受地主剥削压迫的痛苦。旧社会，我们黎族贫下中农从小孩到老人，没有一个识字的，连自己的年纪都不知道。这些悲惨的回忆给教员们教育很大。他们说：我们要革命不要钱。我们一定全心全意地为贫下中农服务，坚决支持贫下中农掌握文权。这样，小学教员实行了半日上课半日劳动制度。教师每天上午带着参加三大革命实践的体会给学生讲课，下午扛着锄头下地劳动。他们既是好教员，又是好社员。拿起锄头能种田，拿起笔杆能批判资产阶级，成为新型的知识分子，成为贫下中农的贴心人。
