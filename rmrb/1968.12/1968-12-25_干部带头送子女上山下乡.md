Cadres in the Zunyi Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army, along with ordinary cadres, have followed the teachings of Chairman Mao by sending all their children who should go to the countryside to the rural areas. Under their exemplary influence, almost all those who should go to the countryside in the entire Zunyi region have reached the frontlines of agricultural production.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guiyang on the 24th, the leading cadres of the Zunyi Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army have taken the lead in sending their children to the countryside. Following the example of the military cadres, cadres at all levels and revolutionary masses have also sent their children to the countryside.

The leading organs of the Zunyi Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army, as early as March this year, followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, mobilizing cadres to play a model and leading role in the work of sending children to the countryside. The military sub-district leadership clearly proposed that supporting children to settle in the countryside is a major issue in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and required all cadres, staff, and family members to set a good example with practical actions. Many cadres used their own personal experiences to educate their children about the bitterness and sweetness of the past, revolutionary traditions, and the revolutionary future, raising their children's awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Old Red Army veteran, member of the Zunyi Revolutionary Committee, and commander of the military sub-district, Comrade Tang Chenghai, used his own experience of being forced to be a cowherd for a landlord from a young age and suffering exploitation and oppression to educate his daughter Tang Jihong, greatly raising her consciousness. Soon, Tang Jihong and the children of other leading cadres in the military sub-district took the lead in settling in remote mountainous areas.

The practical actions of the leading cadres had a great educational impact on other cadres, family members, and children in the sub-district offices, quickly creating a scene where cadres and family members encouraged their children to go to the countryside and compete to settle in the countryside. Some cadres, while attending meetings out of town, heard the news and wrote letters back, mobilizing their children to go to the countryside first. By mid-November, from the commander and political commissar of the sub-district to the ordinary cadres, all children who should go to the countryside had gone to the countryside 100%. Under the influence of the exemplary actions of the military cadres, by mid-December, almost all those who should go to the countryside in the entire Zunyi region had reached the frontlines of agricultural production. Batch after batch of knowledge youth, before going to the countryside, gathered at the Zunyi Conference Site and the Red Army Martyrs' Tomb, holding up revolutionary books, solemnly swearing: They would definitely follow the arduous path of the old Red Army, becoming successors of the revolutionary cause forever loyal to Chairman Mao.

    干部带头送子女上山下乡
    解放军遵义军分区领导干部和一般干部遵照毛主席的教导，把凡应下乡的子女全部送到农村。在他们模范作用影响下，全遵义地区应到农村去的人基本上到了农业第一线
    据新华社贵阳二十四日电　中国人民解放军遵义军分区领导干部，带头把自己的子女送到乡下去。在军队干部带动下，各级干部和革命群众也纷纷把自己的子女送到了乡下。
    解放军遵义军分区领导机关，早在今年三月，就遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，动员干部在送子女上山下乡的工作中起模范、带头作用。军分区领导机关明确提出：支持子女到农村安家落户是贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的大问题，要求全体干部、职工、家属，用实际行动作出好样子。许多干部都以自己亲身的经历，对子女进行忆苦思甜教育、革命传统教育和革命前途教育，提高子女执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性。老红军战士、遵义地区革委会常委、分区司令员唐成海同志，用自己从小就被迫给地主当放牛娃，受尽了剥削和压迫的亲身经历，对女儿唐继红进行教育，大大提高了她的觉悟。不久，唐继红和军分区其他领导干部的子女，就带头到边远山区去安家落户。
    领导干部的实际行动给了分区机关其他干部、家属和子女很大教育，机关里迅速出现了一个干部、家属鼓励子女上山下乡、争相到农村安家落户的动人场面。有的干部在外地开会，听到这一消息，也写信回来，动员自己的子女第一批下乡。到十一月中旬，从分区司令员、政委到一般干部的子女，凡应下乡的，已百分之百下到了农村。在军队干部模范行动影响下，到十二月中旬，全遵义地区应该到农村去的人基本上到了农业生产第一线。一批批下乡的知识青年在下乡前，聚集在遵义会议会址和红军烈士墓前，高举革命宝书，庄严宣誓：一定走老红军艰苦创业的道路，做永远忠于毛主席的革命事业的接班人。（附图片）
