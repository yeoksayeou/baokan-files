We follow Chairman Mao's directive to "shorten the school system and revolutionize education," and propose several suggestions for reforming urban middle schools for discussion among revolutionary comrades.

1. Strengthen the leadership of the working class over schools and establish a tripartite leadership body. Under the leadership of the factory party organization and revolutionary committee, the school revolutionary committee should be composed mainly of factory workers, along with revolutionary teachers and students. The school party organization and revolutionary committee should, under the leadership of the factory party organization and revolutionary committee, unify the school's political work and teaching work. Major school issues should be approved by the factory revolutionary committee. To strengthen leadership over schools, it is suggested that an education group be established within the factory revolutionary committee to lead the school's specific work.

2. Schools should prioritize the study of Mao Zedong Thought above all else. Through education, students should firmly establish a class struggle perspective, a perspective on the two-line struggle, a perspective on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a perspective on serving the people, a mass perspective, and a labor perspective. Workers should regularly conduct class education for students, continuously raising their political consciousness. Students and workers should together criticize revisionism and resolutely take the path of political education.

3. Firmly implement the policy of "four orientations" for graduates. We believe this should not only be realized in the minds of teachers and students but also specifically implemented in the cultivation objectives, curriculum settings, and every teaching link. At the same time, considering the impending industrial technological revolution and the development of mechanization and electrification in rural areas driven by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we should strengthen the training of students in basic skills to meet the needs of the great development of industrial and agricultural production.

4. Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, establish a worker lecturer team and tripartite (worker, student, teacher) teaching groups to teach together, implementing "officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, soldiers teach soldiers," mutual teaching and learning, and mutual progress. Strengthen on-site teaching, learning professional knowledge in production practice, and returning to production. Workers, students, and teachers should all be organized according to military regulations, abolishing the old class head system, teaching and research group system, and promotion and retention system, and implementing a guidance system. This is conducive to implementing the policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." Graduates should be evaluated by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

5. Issues related to the school system and school forms. It is suggested to enroll students who have completed primary school (aligned with primary school) with a general school system of four years. The school form can be diverse. One type is a four-year vocational school (divided by majors, but the major settings should consider urban-rural adaptability). Another type is a factory-run general school (not divided by majors, generally setting industrial foundation courses and agricultural foundation courses, but should focus on the characteristics of the school's industry). Another type is to enroll graduates who have completed junior high school. A two-year school system is appropriate.

6. Issues related to teachers and funding. The existing teaching staff (including ordinary middle schools and factory schools) must be rectified, transformed, and rebuilt. They should be sent to labor in batches to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Significantly reduce the number of full-time teachers and select politically conscious workers with practical experience to serve as part-time teachers in schools, changing the situation where intellectuals are piled up in schools. Intellectuals who have come out of old schools and are relatively well-integrated with workers and peasants can also take on the task of educating students.

7. "Students should also focus on learning while also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and criticizing bourgeois ideas." Students should work in factories, generally starting with ordinary or service-oriented jobs, and then stabilizing the job position relatively, and implementing a rotation system in a planned and step-by-step manner. For learning agriculture, link with nearby communes, organize support for "three summers" and "three autumns" labor. In this process, invite poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct class education for students and teach agricultural knowledge courses. This can link theory with practice, achieving the goal of learning industry and agriculture, cultivating students' feelings for workers and peasants, and overcoming the idea of prioritizing industry over agriculture. For learning military affairs, invite demobilized soldiers from the factory to teach military physical education courses, learn the three-eight work style and four firsts of the People's Liberation Army, achieve ideological revolutionization. At the same time, strengthen students' physical fitness and learn the skills to defend the motherland.

8. "Textbooks must be thoroughly reformed, and some must be simplified first." Currently, a four-part (worker, student, teacher, technical personnel) textbook compilation group should be established to conduct extensive investigations in factories and rural areas, compile textbooks that emphasize proletarian politics and are closely linked to reality according to the current industrial and agricultural production situation, and meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development.

The working class leading schools is a consistent idea of the great leader Chairman Mao. In the past, factory-run half-work-half-study schools, under the rule of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, did not emphasize proletarian politics, and the poison was quite deep. We must insist on carrying out revolutionary criticism, seriously summarize experiences and lessons, and strive to create urban "May 7th-type" schools.

    工厂办中学的几点建议
    我们遵循毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的教导，对城市中学的改革提出几点建议，供革命同志讨论。
    一、加强工人阶级对学校的领导，建立三结合的权力机构。在工厂党组织和革委会领导下，以工厂工人为主，结合革命教师、革命学生组成学校革命委员会。学校党组织和革委会应在工厂党组织和革委会的领导下，统一安排学校的政治工作和教学工作。学校重大问题由工厂革委会审定。为加强对学校的领导，建议在工厂革委会中建立教育组，领导学校的具体工作。
    二、学校应把学习毛泽东思想放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。通过教育使学生牢固地树立起阶级斗争观点、两条路线斗争观点、无产阶级专政下继续革命的观点、为人民服务观点、群众观点、劳动观点。由工人阶级经常对学生进行阶级教育，不断提高学生的政治觉悟。让学生和工人一起进行对修正主义的批判，坚决走政治建校的道路。
    三、坚决贯彻毕业生“四个面向”的分配方针。我们认为这不仅要落实到师生的思想上，还应具体落实到培养目标，课程设置，以及每个教学环节上。同时考虑到在文化大革命的强大推动下即将到来的工业技术革命和农村机械化、电气化程度的发展，加强对学生在基本技能方面的训练，以适应工农业生产大发展的需要。
    四、在工厂革委会的领导下，建立工人讲师团，以及三结合（工人、学生、教师）的教学小组，与学生一起实行能者为师，做到“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”，互教互学，教学相长。加强现场教学，在生产实践中学习业务知识，再回到生产中去。工人、学生、教师都按军事编制，废除旧的班主任制、教研组制、升留级制，实行指导员负责制。这样有利于贯彻“备战、备荒、为人民”的方针。学生毕业时由工农兵给予鉴定。
    五、学制问题和办学形式。建议招收读完小学阶段的学生入学（与小学对口），学制一般为四年。办学形式可以多样。一种是四年制的中等专业学校（分专业，但专业设置要考虑到城乡的适应性）。另一种是厂办普通学校（不分专业，一般设工业基础课、农业基础课，但应偏重于办学行业的特点）。再一种是招收读完初中阶段的毕业生。学制以两年为宜。
    六、师资与经费问题。对现有的教师队伍
  （包括普通中学、厂校的教师），必须加以整顿、改造、重建，要分期分批下放劳动，接受工农兵再教育。大力减少专职教师，选拔政治觉悟高、又有实践经验的工人输送到学校担任兼职教师，以改变学校里知识分子成堆的状况。从旧学校出来的知识分子和工农兵结合得比较好的，也可担负教育学生的任务。
    七、“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。”学生进厂劳动，一般先安排普通工种或服务性的工种，然后做到工种岗位相对稳定，并有计划有步骤地采取轮换制。学农采取与工厂附近公社挂钩，组织支援“三夏”、“三秋”劳动。在此过程中，请贫下中农对学生进行阶级教育，上农业知识课。这样能联系实际，达到既学工又学农的目的，培养学生工农感情，克服重工轻农思想。学军采取请工厂复员军人上军体课，学习解放军的三八作风、四个第一，实现思想革命化。同时增强学生体质，学会保卫祖国的本领。
    八、“教材要彻底改革，有的首先删繁就简。”当前应建立一个四结合（工人、学生、教师、技术人员）的教材编写小组，深入工厂、农村作广泛的调查，按照当前工农业生产情况，适应工农业发展需要，逐步编写出突出无产阶级政治的、紧密联系实际的各种教材。
    工人阶级领导学校，是伟大领袖毛主席的一贯思想。以往厂办半工半读学校，在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的统治下，不突出无产阶级政治，流毒是比较深的。应坚持开展革命大批判，认真总结经验和教训，为创造城市“五·七”型的学校而努力。
