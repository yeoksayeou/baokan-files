Urban middle schools should also undergo a thorough revolution, just like rural schools. We suggest that urban middle schools be relocated to factories, truly and fully accepting the leadership of the working class. Such schools can highlight Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line.

We believe that this educational system can fully implement Chairman Mao's series of instructions on educational revolution. Its advantages are:

	(1) It will permanently end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating schools. Each school's revolutionary committee will operate under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, implementing unified leadership and truly carrying out Chairman Mao's instruction that "the worker propaganda teams should stay in schools for a long time to participate in all tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to permanently lead the schools."

	(2) Students will personally engage in the three great revolutions of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, thus implementing the correct policy of integrating theory with practice, education with productive labor, and intellectuals with workers and peasants.

	(3) Because students personally participate in class struggle within the factory and society, they can better reform their old ideas. Students and workers working together and conducting scientific experiments together will bring them closer to the worker masses, allowing them to learn the lofty thoughts and feelings of the working class.

	(4) Chairman Mao said: "The most important issue for a military academy is the selection of the principal and teachers and the determination of the educational policy." In such schools, teachers will act as both teachers and students, and as workers. Such a new type of proletarian revolutionary teaching staff will establish the most solid foundation for cultivating reliable revolutionary successors.

	(5) The content and arrangement of courses will be closely linked to the actual class struggle and the most urgent needs of production labor at that time and in that place. This will allow the theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom to be quickly applied in production labor.

    城市中学应全面接受工人阶级领导
    城市中学也要和农村学校一样来一个彻底革命。我们建议城市中学搬到工厂里去，真正地、全面地接受工人阶级的领导。这样的学校能突出毛泽东思想，彻底摧垮修正主义教育路线。
    我们认为，这种教育体制可以全面落实毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示。它的优点是：
      （一）永远结束了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。各校的革命委员会，一律在工厂革委会领导下工作，实行一元化领导，真正落实毛主席“工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校”的指示。
      （二）学生亲身到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命中去学习，就能贯彻执行理论和实践相结合，教育与生产劳动相结合，知识分子与工农相结合的正确方针。
      （三）由于学生亲自参加工厂中、社会上的阶级斗争，就可以更好地改造旧思想。学生和工人共同劳动、共同搞科学实验，接近了工人群众，就可以学习工人阶级的崇高思想感情。
      （四）毛主席说：“一个军事学校，最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针。”在这样的学校中，教员既当先生，又当学生，又当工人，这样的一支新型的无产阶级革命化的教师队伍，为培养可靠的革命接班人建立了最牢固的基础。
      （五）教学内容，课程设置，都密切联系当时、当地阶级斗争的实际和生产劳动最迫切的需要。使课堂上学到的理论知识，很快地在生产劳动中得到应用。
