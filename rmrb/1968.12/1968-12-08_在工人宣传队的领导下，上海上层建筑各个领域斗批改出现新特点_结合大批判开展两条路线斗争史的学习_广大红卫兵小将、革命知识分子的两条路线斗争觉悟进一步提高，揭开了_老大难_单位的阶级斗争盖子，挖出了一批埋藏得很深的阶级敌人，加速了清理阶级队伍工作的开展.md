Under the leadership of the worker propaganda teams, the struggle, criticism, and transformation of Shanghai's superstructure in various fields have shown new characteristics. By combining the struggle with the study of the history of the two-line struggle, the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary intellectuals has been further heightened. The lid of class struggle in "hard-to-handle" units has been lifted, exposing a batch of deeply hidden class enemies and accelerating the progress of the work to clean up the class ranks.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 7th, the Shanghai Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, which have entered Shanghai's schools and various fields of the superstructure, have displayed the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. They have led the broad revolutionary masses to deeply launch the revolutionary struggle and criticism and the work to clean up the class ranks. They have taken the initiative to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. At the same time, they have, together with the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary intellectuals, earnestly launched the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle within the party. This has enabled the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire superstructure to continuously develop in depth.

Currently, a prominent feature of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of Shanghai's superstructure in various fields is that, under the strong leadership of the worker propaganda teams, the revolutionary struggle and criticism, the cleaning up of the class ranks, and the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle are closely combined. The movement to study the history of the two-line struggle has promoted the revolutionary struggle and criticism and accelerated the work to clean up the class ranks. The deepening of the revolutionary struggle and criticism and the work to clean up the class ranks, in turn, have provided vivid and rich teaching materials for the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle, enabling the study movement to continuously develop in depth.

At present, an important task for various schools and departments of the superstructure in Shanghai is to deeply launch the revolutionary struggle and criticism and to do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, exposing the handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who are in hiding. By combining the revolutionary struggle and criticism and the work to clean up the class ranks, earnestly launch the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle. This will further heighten the awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle among the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary intellectuals, enabling them to distinguish between friends and enemies and to discern right from wrong. They will then be able to firmly, accurately, and resolutely strike at a handful of class enemies and thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Under this guiding ideology, in recent times, various primary and secondary schools, art troupes, news, publishing, and research units in Shanghai have, under the leadership of the worker propaganda teams, universally held classes to study the history of the two-line struggle. Revolutionary masses have, in connection with the history of the two-line struggle in their units since liberation, especially the two-line struggle in the past two years of the Cultural Revolution, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's "Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." In the course of study, many units have, in connection with their actual situations, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, literary and art line, news line, organizational line, and party-building line pursued by the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanghai and in their units. Some units, such as Fudan University, have also held exhibitions on the history of the two-line struggle.

Through the study, the awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle among the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary intellectuals has been further heightened, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses has been more fully aroused. At this time, the worker propaganda teams of various units have immediately led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, with the momentum like a sudden storm and irresistible. The lid of class struggle in some "hard-to-handle" units that have long been unable to be lifted has been lifted, and one after another deeply hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries have been exposed. Units such as the East China Textile Institute, Shanghai Normal University, East China Institute of Chemical Technology, Shanghai First Medical College, Shanghai Yue Opera School, and the East China Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have, due to the instigation of a handful of class enemies, long been plagued by internal strife. Through the study of the history of the two-line struggle, the broad revolutionary masses have opened their eyes, seen through the tricks of a handful of class enemies, and exposed the black hands that instigated the fighting between the two factions. They have consolidated the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of revolution.

On the basis of continuously achieving victories in the work to clean up the class ranks, the worker propaganda teams of various units have taken the handful of class enemies that have been exposed as living teaching materials. They have, in connection with Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, mobilized the broad masses to deeply launch the revolutionary struggle and criticism. This has effectively promoted the thought revolutionization of the broad revolutionary masses. Many Red Guards have excitedly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the foresight, is selfless, and is most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed.' Now we have further understood the profound significance of the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching. If there were no leadership of the working class, we could not do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure. We must honestly learn from the working class and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end."

    在工人宣传队的领导下，上海上层建筑各个领域斗批改出现新特点
    结合大批判开展两条路线斗争史的学习
    广大红卫兵小将、革命知识分子的两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高，揭开了“老大难”单位的阶级斗争盖子，挖出了一批埋藏得很深的阶级敌人，加速了清理阶级队伍工作的开展
    据新华社上海七日电  进驻上海各学校和上层建筑各个领域的上海工人毛泽东思想宣传队，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，率领广大革命群众深入开展革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，主动地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，同时在斗争中和广大红卫兵小将、革命知识分子一起认真地开展党内两条路线斗争史的学习运动，使整个上层建筑领域的斗、批、改不断向纵深发展。
    目前，上海市上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的一个显著特点是：在工人宣传队的坚强领导下，革命的大批判、清理阶级队伍和两条路线斗争史的学习运动紧密地结合起来。两条路线斗争史的学习运动，推动了革命大批判，加速了清理阶级队伍工作的开展；而革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作的深入开展，又为两条路线斗争史的学习运动提供了生动的、丰富的教材，使学习运动不断深入发展。
    当前，上海各学校和上层建筑各个部门的一个重要任务，就是深入开展革命大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍的工作，把隐藏的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子挖出来。结合革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，认真开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步提高广大红卫兵小将、革命知识分子的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，分清敌我，明辨是非，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，彻底肃清叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想。在这样的思想指导下，最近以来，上海各个大中小学，文艺团体，新闻、出版、科研单位，都在工人宣传队的领导下，普遍举办了两条路线斗争史的学习班。革命群众联系本单位解放以来，特别是文化大革命两年多来两条路线斗争的历史，认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示和毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》。在学习中，许多单位结合本单位的实际，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇及其在上海和本单位的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义的教育路线、文艺路线、新闻路线、组织路线、建党路线。复旦大学等一些单位还举办了两条路线斗争历史的展览会。
    通过学习，进一步提高了广大红卫兵小将、革命知识分子的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，群众的革命积极性更充分地调动起来了。这时，各单位的工人宣传队立即适时领导广大革命群众向一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈的进攻，其势如急风暴雨，锐不可挡。一些长期揭不开阶级斗争盖子的“老大难”单位，阶级斗争的盖子揭开了，一个个埋藏得很深的叛徒、特务和反革命分子被挖了出来。华东纺织工学院、上海师范学院、华东化工学院、上海第一医学院、上海越剧学校、中国科学院华东分院等一些单位，由于一小撮阶级敌人的挑动，长期“内战”不止。经过两条路线斗争史的学习，广大革命群众擦亮了眼睛，识破了一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，把挑动两派斗争的黑手揪了出来，巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    各单位的工人宣传队在清理阶级队伍不断取得胜利的基础上，又把揪出来的一小撮阶级敌人作为活教材，联系刘少奇的反革命修正主义谬论，发动广大群众，深入开展革命的大批判，有效地促进了广大革命群众的思想革命化。许多红卫兵小将激动地说，毛主席教导我们：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”现在我们进一步懂得了伟大领袖毛主席这一教导的深刻意义。如果没有工人阶级领导，就不能搞好上层建筑的斗、批、改。我们一定要老老实实地向工人阶级学习，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
