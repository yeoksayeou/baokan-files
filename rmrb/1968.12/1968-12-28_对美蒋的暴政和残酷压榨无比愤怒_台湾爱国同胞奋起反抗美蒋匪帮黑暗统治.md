Taiwanese patriots rise up to resist the dark rule of the U.S.-Chiang bandits

Taiwanese patriots have recently risen up to resist the dark rule and brutal exploitation of the U.S.-Chiang bandits. They have repeatedly killed and injured officials of the Chiang bandits, causing the bandits to panic and be in disarray.

According to reports from Taiwan newspapers, the Chiang bandits recently used the excuse of "regulating traffic order" to ban tricycles, causing many tricycle workers to lose their livelihoods and rise up in resistance. On the morning of August 12, more than fifty tricycle workers in Kaohsiung City stormed into the Kaohsiung "City Hall," besieging the "Mayor" Yang Jinhu, exposing his crimes, and engaging in a resolute struggle with him. On September 14, police in Tainan City, while arbitrarily banning tricycles, were beaten by angry tricycle workers. One police officer was reportedly "attacked with a stick, his head split open," and died on the spot.

In various cities and towns in Taiwan, large numbers of impoverished people, unemployed workers, poor teachers and staff, and retired soldiers of the Chiang army have formed a vast army of hunger. These people are starving, naked, and homeless, living in bamboo huts and wooden shacks in alleys to avoid the wind and rain. But the Chiang bandits, using the excuse of "affecting urban appearance" and "harming international image," sent armed police to forcibly demolish these shelters, sparking great anger among the Taiwanese people. They beat up officials of the Chiang bandits and stormed into the bandits' offices to protest. According to reports, on September 7, Zhang Zhuangxiang, the "Chairman of the Taipei City Council" who ordered the demolition of civilian houses in Taipei, was grabbed by more than twenty victims while "taking a walk." Amid shouts of beating, Zhang was injured. The Chiang bandits hurriedly sent a large number of police to suppress the incident, and he managed to "escape."

On September 11, two officials of the Chiang bandits were beaten by victims while forcibly demolishing houses at Huajiang Bridge. On October 28, when the Chiang bandits' "Taipei City Council" was in session, more than seventy elderly and child-bearing citizens broke through the security line and stormed into the "City Council," angrily protesting the Chiang bandits' forced demolition of their bamboo and wooden shacks, causing the Chiang bandits' "City Council" to be in chaos.

The resistance of Taiwanese compatriots against the dark rule of the U.S. and Chiang has spread across various industries. In Keelung, boat workers bravely fought against the unjust oppression of the Chiang bandits' "Keelung Port Authority" and the bandit army of the "Keelung Garrison Command." Hundreds of farmers from Liangjie and Yanpu Towns in Pingtung County went to the Chiang bandits' "Legislative Yuan" and "Provincial Government" on December 7 and 9 to protest the unjust seizure of their blood-sweat-earned farmland. Service personnel at the "Seamen's Club" in Kaohsiung destroyed the so-called "Seamen's Home" and smashed a port police station of the Chiang bandits, expressing their dissatisfaction with the tyranny of the U.S. and Chiang. A student named Zhu Mingyi from Taichung First Middle School stabbed and injured a Kuomintang spy and military training instructor at the school, protesting the U.S.-Chiang's slave education. On December 17, thousands of residents in Kaohsiung surrounded the fake "Judicial Building," angrily protesting the tyranny of the Chiang bandits' officials oppressing innocent residents.

Taiwanese newspapers recently revealed that weapons and ammunition of the Chiang bandits had been "stolen," and that Taiwanese compatriots armed with knives and guns were fighting against the Chiang bandits. The Chiang bandits' "Central Daily News" on October 20 revealed that four rifles, four bayonets, and 485 bullets had "suddenly disappeared" from an armory in Tainan County. The Chiang bandits considered this case to have caused "great harm to public security" and mobilized all military police and secret agents in Tainan County for investigation, but to no avail. According to reports from Taiwan newspapers, Taiwanese youth, in order to resist the tyranny of the U.S. and Chiang bandits, have organized various groups, hiding knives and guns, appearing and disappearing, and continuously killing and injuring members of the Chiang bandits. The reports said that these people also have handguns and are carrying out activities with plans and purposes. Taiwan newspapers anxiously said: "A trickle of water, if not blocked, will become a river; a small spark, if not extinguished, will become a raging fire."

Taiwanese compatriots have also directed their struggle against the military facilities of the U.S. and Chiang. According to reports from Taiwan newspapers, recently in the Pingtung area, a military oil pipeline of the U.S.-Chiang air force was sabotaged by Taiwanese compatriots, causing the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries to lose 120 barrels of high-grade military gasoline. In the Taichung area, military communication lines of the U.S.-Chiang were repeatedly and seriously sabotaged by Taiwanese compatriots. Dozens of miles of wires were cut, and many areas' military communication equipment were destroyed, reaching an "unusable" state.

Under the fascist rule of the U.S. and Chiang, many innocent people were arrested and imprisoned, and there were frequent prison riots and escapes. According to reports, prisoners detained by the Chiang bandits in Penghu Prison rioted collectively on the Mid-Autumn Festival night, injuring prison guards with hidden weapons. On October 16, five youths detained in the so-called "Zhanghua Youth Guidance Institute" attempted to escape. On the night of October 19, ten people from this "Institute" carried sticks, collectively rushed out of the back yard, and escaped to the mountains. The "Taiwan Daily News" on November 19 in an article exclaimed that due to the "evil customs" of the Chiang bandits, "Taiwan society has become chaotic, and people's hearts are inclined to rebellion," and some have already "joined the ranks of rebellion."

    对美蒋的暴政和残酷压榨无比愤怒
    台湾爱国同胞奋起反抗美蒋匪帮黑暗统治
    他们不断打死打伤蒋匪帮官员，使蒋匪帮恐慌万状，狼狈不堪
    新华社二十七日讯　台湾爱国同胞最近纷纷起来反抗美蒋匪帮的黑暗统治和残酷压榨。他们不断打死打伤蒋匪帮官员，使蒋匪帮恐慌万状，狼狈不堪。
    据台湾报纸报道，蒋匪帮不久前以“整顿交通秩序”为借口取缔三轮车时，许多三轮车工人因无法谋生而奋起反抗。八月十二日上午，高雄市五十多名三轮车工人冲入高雄“市府”，“围困”了“市长”杨金虎，揭露了他的罪行，同他进行了坚决斗争。九月十四日，台南市警察在无理取缔三轮车时，被愤怒的三轮车工人痛打一顿，并有一名警察被工人“用木棍袭击，脑袋开花”，当场毙命。
    在台湾各城镇，大批的贫民、失业工人、穷苦的教职员工以及蒋军退役人员，汇成了庞大的饥饿大军。这些人食不果腹，衣不蔽体，有的人没有住处，就在背街小巷搭个竹棚木寮，聊避风雨。但蒋匪帮竟以“影响市容”、“有碍国际观瞻”为借口，派出大批武装警察强行拆除，激起台湾同胞的极大愤怒。他们痛打蒋匪帮官员，冲进蒋匪帮机关举行抗议。据报道，九月七日，下令拆除台北市民房的蒋匪帮“台北市议会议长”张传祥，在外出“散步”时，被二十多个受害妇女揪住，在一阵喊打声中，张传祥被打成伤。蒋匪慌忙派出大批警察前往镇压，他才“突围逃掉”。九月十一日，两个蒋匪帮官员前往华江大桥引道上强行拆除民房时，也被受害市民痛打一顿，几乎丧命。十月二十八日，当蒋匪帮台北“市议会”开会时，又有七十多个扶老携幼的市民，突破警卫线，冲进“市议会”，愤怒抗议蒋匪帮强迫拆除他们所居住的竹棚木寮，使蒋匪帮“市议会”一片纷乱。
    台湾同胞反抗美、蒋黑暗统治的斗争遍及各行各业。基隆的舢舨工人为了抗议蒋匪帮“基隆港务局”的无理欺压，英勇地与蒋匪军“基隆警备分区”的匪军展开搏斗。屏东县长治、盐埔两乡的数百名农民，十二月七日和九日先后前往蒋帮“议会”、“省府”，抗议蒋帮无理没收他们用血汗开垦出来的农田。高雄市“海员俱乐部”的服务人员不满美、蒋的暴政，捣毁了所谓的“海员之家”，又砸坏了蒋帮的一个港警派出所。台中一中学生朱明义，挥刀杀伤了这个学校的国民党特务、军训教官，抗议美、蒋奴化教育。高雄市数千名居民十二月十七日，把伪“司法大厦”团团包围，愤怒抗议蒋匪官员欺压无辜居民的暴行。
    台湾报纸最近还透露了一些蒋匪帮的枪枝弹药被人“盗窃”和台湾同胞手拿利刃、枪枝同蒋匪帮展开斗争的事件。蒋匪帮《中央日报》十月二十日透露，台南县一个军械库里的四枝步枪、四把刺刀和四百八十五发子弹“突然丢失”。蒋匪帮认为此案“给治安工作带来极大危害”，调动了台南县所有军警特务进行侦察，但一直得不到结果。据台湾报纸报道，台湾青少年，为反抗美蒋匪帮暴行，组织成各种组织，暗藏利刃、枪枝，神出鬼没，不断杀死杀伤蒋匪帮人员。报道说，这些人还藏有手枪，有计划、有目的地在进行活动。台湾报纸恐慌不安地说：“涓涓不壅，将成江河，星星不灭，亦可形成燎原之火”。
    台湾同胞还把斗争的矛头指向美、蒋的军事设施。据台湾报纸透露，不久前，在屏东地区，美蒋空军军用油管遭到台湾同胞破坏，使美、蒋反动派损失军用高级汽油一百二十大桶。在台中地区，美蒋军用通讯电线连续多次被台湾同胞严重破坏，几十里长的电线被剪断，有很多地区的军用交通设备也被毁坏，达到了“不堪应用”的程度。
    在美蒋法西斯统治下，许多无辜人民被捕入狱之后，不断发生闹狱、越狱事件。据报道，被蒋匪帮囚禁在澎湖监狱的“囚犯”，在中秋之夜“集体闹狱”，用暗藏的利器把狱吏杀伤。十月十六日，被关在所谓“彰化少年辅育院”的五名青年冒险越狱。十月十九日深夜，这个“辅育院”又有十人携带木棍，集体冲出后院，逃往山区。《台湾日报》十一月十九日在一篇文章里惊呼，由于蒋匪帮的“恶风劣习把台湾社会搞得乌烟瘴气，人心思变，乃有叛乱”，并有人已“参加了叛乱行列”。
