People of Hyogo Prefecture's Awaji Island Launch Brave Struggle

	BEIJING, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- TOKYO, Dec. 23 -- People of Awaji Island in Hyogo Prefecture have recently launched a series of brave struggles against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries who, under the pretext of building a "Kansai New International Airport," are plotting to construct a large military airfield in the southern part of Hyogo Prefecture and between Awaji Island and Tokushima Prefecture in Shikoku.

	On Nov. 13, more than 1,000 fishermen and women from Kitada and Ikuta districts of Awaji Island marched to Kitada Town to hold a demonstration. At the same time, a group of local fishermen on more than 30 fishing boats sailed to the sea off Kitada Town's government building, holding a sea demonstration. Each boat flew a straw banner with slogans against the construction of a military airfield on Awaji Island.

	At 2 p.m. that day, the land and sea demonstration contingents triumphantly converged in front of the Kitada Town government building. Some demonstrators, indignant at the situation, rushed into the "consultation meeting" hall of the town government, smashing the "consultation meeting" planned by the prefectural authorities.

	The demonstrators then held a mass meeting in front of the town government building, passing a resolution firmly opposing the construction of a military airfield on Awaji Island by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

	On Dec. 13, more than 200 workers, farmers, and fishermen from Awaji Island marched to Kobe, the capital of Hyogo Prefecture, where they held a protest rally in front of the Kobe City Government and then a demonstration in front of the prefectural government, expressing their firm opposition to the construction of a military airfield on Awaji Island.

	At present, places like Tomogashima, Kitada, and Ikuta on Awaji Island have established mass organizations against the construction of a military airfield. Large banners reading "Firmly Oppose the Construction of an International Airport" are seen everywhere in these towns.

    抗议美日反动派修建军用机场
    日本兵库县人民展开英勇斗争
    新华社二十三日讯  东京消息：日本兵库县淡路岛人民最近为反对美日反动派打着修建“关西新国际机场”的幌子，蓄谋在兵库县南部与四国德岛县之间的淡路岛修建大型军用机场，开展了一系列英勇的斗争。
    十一月十三日上午，淡路岛的室津、育波滨两个地区的渔民和妇女一千多人向北淡町进发，举行示威游行；与此同时，一批当地渔民分乘三十多艘渔船拥向北淡町公所所在地的富岛冲海面，举行海上示威，每一条船上都插着写有斗争口号的草帘旗，表示坚决反对在淡路岛修建军用机场。
    当天下午两点钟，陆上和海上示威的群众队伍在北淡町公所前胜利会师。有一批示威群众怒不可遏地冲进町公所的“恳谈会”会场，粉碎了县当局计划举行的“恳谈会”。
    紧接着，示威群众又在町公所前举行了奋起大会，会上通过了坚决反对美日反动派在淡路岛修建军用机场的“决议”。
    十二月十三日，淡路岛的工人、农民和渔民二百多人拥向兵库县政府所在地神户市，在神户市政府前举行了抗议集会后，又到县政府前举行了示威游行，表示坚决反对在淡路岛修建军用机场。
    目前，淡路岛的富岛冲、室津、育波滨等地都成立了反对修建军用机场的群众组织。在这些市镇的街道上，到处竖立着写有“坚决反对修建国际机场”的大标语牌。
