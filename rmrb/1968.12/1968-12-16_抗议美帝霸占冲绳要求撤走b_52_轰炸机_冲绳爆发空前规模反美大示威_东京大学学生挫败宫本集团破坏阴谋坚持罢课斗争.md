	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, Tokyo: Approximately 40,000 people from various parts of Okinawa held a massive protest rally and demonstration in Kadena on the 14th, firmly demanding the recovery of Okinawa and the removal of U.S. military bases. This was the largest-scale struggle by the people of Okinawa since the war. It marked a new high point in the struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism's occupation of Okinawa and for the recovery of Okinawa. This powerful struggle dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

	That afternoon, the crowds participating in the protest rally, holding red flags and banners, were all full of fighting spirit and high morale. Representatives from various sectors in their speeches severely condemned the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism's occupation of Okinawa, demanding that U.S. imperialism must withdraw its B-52 bombers from Okinawa. After the rally, the crowds held a grand demonstration march, surrounding the U.S. military base in Kadena. The U.S. military authorities, terrified, hastily mobilized a large number of U.S. soldiers to guard the various gates of the base, and even dispatched three helicopters to provoke the demonstrators. The loyal henchmen of U.S. imperialism—the Ryukyu Police Headquarters—also quickly dispatched several thousand armed Japanese police to suppress the demonstrators.

	The people of Okinawa, who harbor deep hatred towards U.S. imperialism, fearlessly raised slogans such as "Oppose the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" and "Yankees go home!" A contingent of more than 2,000 young students bravely charged at the barbed wire fence of the U.S. military base and threw stones into the base. This contingent also rushed towards a large gate of the Kadena base and engaged in a struggle with the police.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 14th, the Oriental News Agency reported: Approximately 2,000 students of Tokyo University, who have been on strike for nearly 300 days, held a meeting on December 13th, exposing and foiling the new plot by the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party to sabotage the student movement.

	The revisionist traitor group of the Japanese Communist Party, frightened by the thriving student movement, recently shamelessly advocated that the "suggestion" made by the acting president of Tokyo University, Kato Ichiro, which aims to sabotage the student movement, should be given a "positive evaluation" and that the university authorities should be "respected." This traitor group colluded with right-wing students and attempted to hold a so-called "meeting" on the 13th to elect "representatives" to "negotiate" with the university authorities, trying to realize their plot to sabotage the student movement.

	The meeting of progressive students at Tokyo University was held to oppose and prevent the revisionist group led by Miyamoto from holding the so-called "meeting" on the 13th to sabotage the student movement. After the meeting, the students, shouting slogans to overthrow the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party and to fully realize their just demands, held a demonstration march.

	The resolute struggle of the students made the revisionist group led by Miyamoto look pathetic. On the 13th, due to the sparse attendance of students, the "meeting" of the revisionist group led by Miyamoto could not be held. Seeing the situation was not favorable, the university authorities hastily mobilized many armed police to the university gate, threatening to rush into the campus to suppress the students' just struggle. The students, fearless of violence, lined up and marched towards the venue where the revisionist group led by Miyamoto was preparing to hold the meeting, broke through the wooden barricades, and entered the venue, giving the revisionist group a severe punishment, causing their plot to fail.

    抗议美帝霸占冲绳要求撤走B—52轰炸机
    冲绳爆发空前规模反美大示威
    东京大学学生挫败宫本集团破坏阴谋坚持罢课斗争
    据新华社十五日讯　东京消息：冲绳各地的日本人民约四万人，十四日在嘉手纳举行声势浩大的抗议集会和示威游行，坚决要求收复冲绳和撤除美军基地。这是战后冲绳人民进行的规模最大的一次斗争。它标志着日本人民反对美帝霸占冲绳、要求收复冲绳的斗争，出现了新高潮。这次强大的斗争给了美日反动派沉重打击。
    当天下午，参加抗议大会的群众举着红旗和标语牌，个个斗志昂扬，意气风发。各界代表在讲话中严厉谴责美帝霸占冲绳的滔天罪行，要求美帝必须从冲绳撤走B—52型轰炸机。会后，群众举行了浩浩荡荡的示威游行，包围了嘉手纳美国军事基地。美军当局吓破了胆，慌忙调动大批美国士兵把守基地的各个大门，并且还出动了三架直升飞机，向示威群众挑衅。美军当局的忠实爪牙——琉球警察总部也连忙调来几千名日本武装警察，镇压示威群众。
    对美帝国主义怀着深仇大恨的冲绳人民，不畏强暴，振臂高呼“反对日美‘安全条约’！”“美国佬滚出去！”等战斗口号。由两千多名青年学生组成的队伍，勇敢地用身体猛撞美军基地的铁丝网，并向基地内投掷石块。这支队伍还冲向嘉手纳基地的一个大门，同警察展开了搏斗。
    据新华社十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：坚持罢课斗争将近三百天的大约两千名东京大学学生，十二月十三日举行集会，揭露和挫败了日共宫本修正主义集团妄图破坏学生运动的新阴谋。
    被蓬勃发展的学生运动吓破了胆的日共修正主义叛徒集团最近无耻地叫嚣对东京大学代理校长加藤一郎提出的旨在破坏学生运动的“建议”应给予“肯定的评价”和“应该尊重大学当局”。这个叛徒集团同右派学生勾结在一起，并企图在十三日召开所谓的“集会”来选举同大学当局进行“谈判”的“代表”，力图实现他们破坏学生运动的阴谋。
    东京大学进步学生的集会，就是为了反对和阻止宫本集团企图在十三日召开的破坏学生运动的所谓“集会”而举行的。会后，学生们高呼打倒日共宫本修正主义集团和要求完全实现他们的正义要求的口号，举行示威游行。
    学生们的坚决斗争，使宫本修正主义集团狼狈不堪。十三日，由于到会的学生寥寥无几，宫本修正主义集团的“集会”开不起来。大学当局见势不妙，慌忙调动了许多武装警察到大学门前，扬言要冲进大学校园，镇压学生的正义斗争。学生们不畏强暴列队前往宫本修正主义集团准备集会的会场，冲过了木制路障，开进了会场，给宫本修正主义集团以严厉的惩罚，使它的阴谋遭到了破产。（附图片）
