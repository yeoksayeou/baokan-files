The Red Mountain People's Commune in Liaoning Province's Zhanghe County has, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," with the help of the agricultural health work team from the rear services department of the People's Liberation Army's Shenyang Military Region, taken back the medical and health power in the countryside in August this year. They have smashed the capitalist management system of the former brigade health stations that operated on a self-sufficient basis and implemented the cooperative medical care system. They have established genuine health stations that serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, fundamentally changing the medical and health work in the countryside.

After the poor and lower-middle peasants in this commune took control of the medical and health power in the countryside, they implemented the cooperative medical care system based on the actual situation of the commune and the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Their approach is as follows: The brigade is the basic accounting unit, and the commune withdraws a portion of the cooperative medical care fees from the brigade to be used flexibly in case of major medical situations where the cooperative medical care fees are insufficient. Each brigade, based on its specific situation, has the poor and lower-middle peasants contribute eight fen per person per year, with an additional four fen from the public welfare fund, or one yuan per person per year, with the money collected and used by the brigade. The poor and lower-middle peasants do not have to pay for medical treatment and medication. The medication fees for those who need long-term medication are discussed and decided by the poor and lower-middle peasants, with a portion or all of the fees reimbursed based on the family and personal situation. The participation of the children of the four types of elements in the cooperative medical care system is discussed and decided by the poor and lower-middle peasants based on the individual's performance.

To manage the medical and health power well and consolidate the cooperative medical care system, the poor and lower-middle peasants in Red Mountain Commune, in addition to establishing a special management organization at the commune level, have also established a cooperative medical care committee consisting of brigade cadres, representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and medical personnel. The production team is composed of cadres, representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and health workers to form a cooperative medical care leading group. Each brigade's health station purchases medicines based on the illness, with the prices of the medicines announced to the public. The cooperative medical care committee reports the work situation to the poor and lower-middle peasants every month. The brigade health station, based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, has established home care rooms, night duty, and visiting medical services, making it convenient for the poor and lower-middle peasants. They also, based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, mobilize the masses to go up the mountains to dig for herbs, explore folk remedies, and carry out acupuncture treatment, achieving the goal of treating major illnesses with little or no money. They also focus on environmental and personal hygiene, thoroughly implementing the principle of "prevention first."

After the poor and lower-middle peasants in Red Mountain Commune took control of the medical and health power and implemented the cooperative medical care system, they built their own health stations in ten out of the eleven brigades, except for the one where the commune health hospital is located, without spending a single penny of the state's money. Each production team has a health worker, ensuring that the illnesses of the poor and lower-middle peasants are treated in a timely manner. When it comes to the poor and lower-middle peasants taking control of the medical and health power and implementing the cooperative medical care system, the poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously praise it as very good.

The medical personnel in each brigade of this commune participate in the labor of the production team when they are not treating patients. They carry their medicine bags with them at all times, delivering medical care and medicine to the fields, farmlands, and kang beds, wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some of them also serve as veterinarians and broadcast line inspectors for the production team. Seeing that the poor and lower-middle peasants have difficulty selling local specialties, some medical personnel voluntarily take on the role of carrying baskets and become voluntary procurement agents. The poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically praise them as "carrying doctors."

Now, the medical and health work in this commune has undergone a profound change. In the past, the Daheshui Brigade had many patients. Since the poor and lower-middle peasants took control of the medical and health power and implemented the cooperative medical care system, no epidemics have occurred, and no one has gone out for treatment, significantly increasing the attendance rate. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly say: "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line makes Red Mountain even redder, and the people of Red Mountain are even more loyal to Chairman Mao."

    红山公社实行合作医疗制度，显示巨大优越性
    贫下中农牢牢掌管医疗卫生大权  推动农村医疗卫生工作阔步前进
    据新华社沈阳二十日电　辽宁庄河县红山人民公社的广大贫下中农，遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，在人民解放军旅大驻军某部后勤部农村卫生工作队的帮助下，于今年八月夺回了农村的医疗卫生大权，摧毁了过去大队卫生所“自负盈亏”的资本主义经营制度，实行合作医疗制度，建立了真正为贫下中农服务的卫生所，使农村医疗卫生工作发生了根本的变化。
    这个公社的贫下中农掌管了农村医疗卫生大权以后，根据公社的实际情况和贫下中农的意见，实行了合作医疗制度。他们的作法是：以大队为基本核算单位，公社从大队合作医疗费中抽出一部分，以备个别大队发生重大医疗情况，合作医疗费不够时机动使用。各大队根据本队具体情况，有的由贫下中农每人每年出八角钱，再由公益金中出四角，有的由贫下中农每人每年出一元，把钱集中到大队统一使用，贫下中农看病吃药都不花钱了。常年用药的病人的药费，根据其家庭情况和本人情况，由贫下中农讨论决定报销一部或全部。四类分子子弟，根据本人表现由贫下中农讨论决定是否能参加合作医疗制度。
    红山公社贫下中农为了掌管好卫生医疗大权，巩固合作医疗制度，除了在公社一级建立专门的管理机构外，还由大队干部、贫下中农代表、医务人员建立三结合的合作医疗委员会，生产队由干部、贫下中农代表和卫生员组成合作医疗领导小组。各大队的卫生所根据病情采购药品，药品价格公布于众，合作医疗委员会每月都要向贫下中农汇报工作情况。大队卫生所根据贫下中农的意见，建立了家庭病房、夜间值班制度和巡诊制度等，处处方便贫下中农。他们还根据山区的特点，发动群众上山采挖草药，发掘民间土方，开展针灸治疗，做到少花钱治大病或不花钱也治病，并且大搞环境卫生和个人卫生，认真贯彻“预防为主”的方针。
    红山公社贫下中农掌管了医疗卫生大权，实行了合作医疗制度后，在几个月里，没用国家一分钱，全公社十一个大队除公社卫生院所在大队没设卫生所外，其余十个大队都建立了自己的卫生所，每个生产队都有了卫生员，使贫下中农的疾病得到了及时治疗。一提到贫下中农掌管医疗卫生大权，实行合作医疗制度，贫下中农无不齐声称赞好得很。
    这个公社各大队的医务人员，在不治病时和社员一起参加生产队的劳动。他们平时药包不离身，送医送药到田间、地头、炕头，全心全意地为贫下中农服务，有的还兼任生产队的兽医和广播线的检查员。有的医务人员看到贫下中农出售土特产不方便，便主动担起了挑筐，担任了义务收购员，贫下中农热情地称赞他们是“担担医生”。
    现在，这个公社的医疗卫生工作面貌发生了深刻的变化。大河沿大队过去病号多，自从贫下中农掌管医疗卫生大权，实行合作医疗制度以来，没有发生任何流行病，也没有一个人外出治病，大大提高了出勤率。广大贫下中农兴奋地说：“毛主席的革命路线使红山变得更红，红山的人也对毛主席更忠了。”
