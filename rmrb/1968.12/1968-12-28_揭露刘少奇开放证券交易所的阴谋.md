In March 1949, at the crucial moment when the Chinese people were about to achieve the final victory in the War of Liberation, our great leader Chairman Mao, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, wisely proposed the great program of transforming the New Democratic Revolution into a Socialist Revolution, establishing and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and building socialism. Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must build China into a great socialist country." The fundamental domestic contradiction will be "the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie." "We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class," and "adopt a flexible policy of appropriate restrictions on capitalism."

Soon after the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee ended, the representative of the bourgeoisie within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, launched a fierce attack on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In Tianjin, he colluded with capitalists to restore the securities exchange, which was an important part of his counter-revolutionary activities.

In capitalist society, the securities exchange is a place for buying and selling stocks and other securities, a gambling den for speculators, and a paradise for adventurers. Because stock prices fluctuate, some speculators exploit the changes in stock prices to engage in large-scale speculative trading, buying and selling empty stocks. Speculators even create incidents, drive up prices, and cause stock prices to fluctuate violently, making huge profits from it. Therefore, buying and selling empty stocks is a characteristic of the securities exchange. There, buying and selling are not real transactions, supply and demand are not real supply and demand, and it is purely gambling with money. This fully reflects the parasitic and decadent nature of capitalism.

After liberation, the Chinese people implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and resolutely carried out various policies to restrict capitalism, taking decisive measures to seize and close down the securities exchange. This restricted the spread of capitalism. However, the bourgeoisie was not willing to admit defeat. In order to develop capitalism, they engaged in large-scale speculative trading and profiteering, disrupting the socialist economic market, and desperately clung to the securities exchange. Less than a month after Tianjin was liberated, the bourgeoisie eagerly demanded the restoration of the securities exchange from the people's government.

The bourgeoisie deeply understood that in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party, they had to closely cooperate with the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Party to realize their dream of developing capitalism. For this purpose, they let an extremely reactionary capitalist, Liu Shaoqi's brother-in-law Wang Guangying, take the lead and collude with Liu Shaoqi. Subsequently, Liu Shaoqi personally went to Tianjin and met directly with the big capitalists, secretly plotting and conspiring, doing many evil deeds of selling out the interests of the working class and advocating the development of capitalism. He even shamelessly said in front of the capitalists, "If you have any practical and feasible suggestions, feel free to propose them, and I can take half the responsibility." The Tianjin Securities Exchange was the one he agreed to restore and open in response to the needs of the capitalists.

The opening of the securities exchange played a very bad role in the early days of the founding of the nation.

At that time, there was a large amount of capital in society, which was originally deposited in state banks through savings and deposits to be used for planned development of the socialist economy. After the securities exchange was opened, this capital was absorbed by the capitalists and used to develop capitalism.

The opening of the securities exchange encouraged speculative trading and affected the stability of market prices. Liu Shaoqi, in order to cover up the true purpose of opening the securities exchange, falsely claimed, "How can we find a proper outlet for speculative capital?" "We now hope to raise the dividends... and speculative floating capital will turn to industry." His accomplices also shouted, "Opening the securities market can absorb floating capital and avoid impacting other markets." This is completely unworthy of refutation and deceitful talk! In fact, the securities exchange itself is a large speculative market. In June 1949, 87% of the stock trading volume in the Tianjin Securities Exchange was speculative trading. In July 1949, 92% was speculative trading. At the same time, the opening of the securities exchange gave the brokers of the old society a legal cover, allowing them to engage in black market activities such as gold and silver coins. Coupled with the speculators stirring up trouble, driving up stock prices, which in turn drove market price fluctuations, it undermined the proletarian regime's leadership over the market.

Moreover, bourgeois elements took the opportunity to sell a large number of stocks, turning the frozen capital in stocks into active capital, obtaining a large amount of capital to engage in speculative trading and sabotage the national economy, and living the decadent life of the parasitic bourgeoisie of the old society again.

Liu Shaoqi and his gang even attempted to establish securities exchanges in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and other places to buy and sell securities; they even planned to establish investment companies, issue securities, and build a long-term capital market to accumulate capital for the development of capitalism.

All of this fully exposed the ugly face of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi acting as an agent of the bourgeoisie.

After the basic victory of the New Democratic Revolution, the Chinese people resolutely implemented the great program proposed by Chairman Mao at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, immediately turning to the socialist revolution, launching a fierce attack on capitalism from the political and economic fronts. Especially the "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" campaigns in 1952 exposed the various evil activities of the capitalists and repelled the arrogant attacks of the bourgeoisie. The Tianjin Securities Exchange was finally uprooted in July 1952.

Exposing Liu Shaoqi's plot to open the securities exchange makes us even more aware of how great and wise Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle under socialist conditions is! It makes us love our great leader Chairman Mao even more! It was he who, at the critical moment, timely exposed and smashed Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary plot, enabling the socialist revolution to advance rapidly. At the same time, it makes us focus all our hatred on the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. We firmly support the decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and will definitely criticize and denounce this clown who attempted to reverse the wheel of history.

    揭露刘少奇开放证券交易所的阴谋
    杭津宣
    一九四九年三月，在中国人民将要获得解放战争的最后胜利的关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上，英明地提出了由新民主主义革命转变为社会主义革命、建立和巩固无产阶级专政、建设社会主义的伟大纲领。毛主席指出：“把中国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。”国内基本矛盾将是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”，“对于资本主义采取恰如其分的有伸缩性的限制政策”。
    七届二中全会结束不久，资产阶级在党内的代理人刘少奇，就向毛主席的革命路线发动了猖狂进攻。在天津勾结资本家恢复证券交易所，就是他反革命活动的一个重要内容。
    在资本主义社会里，证券交易所是买卖股票和其它债券的场所，是投机家的大赌场和冒险家的乐园。由于股票行市有涨有落，就使得一些投机分子利用股票行市的变化大搞投机交易，买空卖空。投机分子甚至还制造事端，哄抬物价，引起股票行市激烈波动，从中牟取暴利。因此，买空卖空是证券交易所的特点。在那里，买卖不是真正的买卖，供求不是真实的供求，完全是钱财的赌博。这充分地表现了资本主义的寄生性和腐朽性。
    解放后，中国人民贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决执行了限制资本主义的各项政策，对于证券交易所采取了查抄、封闭的断然措施。这就限制了资本主义泛滥。但是，资产阶级并不甘心失败。他们为了发展资本主义，大搞买空卖空，投机倒把，破坏社会主义经济市场，就拚命地抓住证券交易所这块阵地不放。在天津刚刚解放不到一个月的时间，资产阶级就迫不及待地向人民政府提出恢复证券交易所的要求。
    资产阶级深深懂得，在共产党领导下的新中国，必须通过混入我们党内的资产阶级代理人密切配合，才能实现他们发展资本主义的美梦。为此，他们就让一个极端反动的资本家、刘少奇的大舅子王光英出面，与刘少奇紧紧地勾结起来。随后，刘少奇又亲自跑到天津，与天津的大资本家直接会晤，密谋协商，干了许多出卖工人阶级利益、鼓吹发展资本主义的罪恶勾当。他甚至厚颜无耻地当着资本家的面说，你们“有什么有益的切实可行的建议，尽管提出来，我可以做一半主”。天津证券交易所就是他适应资本家的需要而满口答应恢复开放的。
    证券交易所的开放，在建国初期起了极坏的作用。
    当时社会上有大量资金，本来是通过储蓄、存款方式存入国家银行，用来有计划地发展社会主义经济的。证券交易所开放以后，这些资金就被资本家吸收过去，用以发展资本主义。
    证券交易所的开放助长了投机倒把活动，影响了市场物价的稳定。刘少奇为了掩盖他们开办证券交易所的真实目的，胡说什么：“如何替投机资本想一个正当的出路呢？”“我们现在希望把股息提高……投机游资就会转向工业”。他的娄罗也跟着喊：“开放证券市场能够吸收游资，避免冲击其它市场。”这完全是不值一驳的骗人鬼话！实际上，证券交易所本身就是一个大投机市场。一九四九年六月，天津证券交易所股票成交额中，就有百分之八十七是买空卖空的投机交易。一九四九年七月，有百分之九十二是投机交易。同时，证券交易所的开放，给旧社会的经纪人披上了合法的外衣，他们就可以放手地进行黄金、银元等黑市活动。再加上投机分子兴风作浪，哄抬股票行市，从而带动市场物价的波动，破坏无产阶级政权对市场的领导。
    另外，资产阶级分子还趁机大量卖出股票，把冻结在股票上面的死资金变成活资金，取得了大量资本去进行投机倒把、破坏国计民生的罪恶勾当，重新过起旧社会食利资产阶级的腐朽生活。
    刘少奇及其一伙还妄图在上海、汉口、广州、重庆、西安等地，设立证券交易所，买卖证券；甚至企图设立投资公司，发行证券，建立长期资金市场，为发展资本主义积累资金。
    所有这些，充分地暴露了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇充当资产阶级代理人的丑恶嘴脸。
    中国人民在新民主主义革命取得基本胜利以后，坚决贯彻执行毛主席在党的七届二中全会上提出的伟大纲领，立即转入社会主义革命，对资本主义从政治上、经济上发动了猛烈的进攻。特别是一九五二年的“三反”、“五反”运动，揭露了资本家的种种罪恶活动，打退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻。天津证券交易所终于在一九五二年七月被连根拔掉了。
    揭露刘少奇开放证券交易所的阴谋，使我们更加认识到毛主席关于社会主义条件下阶级与阶级斗争的理论是多么伟大，多么英明！使我们更加热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席！正是他老人家在关键时刻，及时识破和粉碎了刘少奇的反革命阴谋，使社会主义革命事业得以飞速前进。同时，也更加使我们把千仇万恨集中到叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇身上。我们坚决拥护党的八届扩大的十二中全会关于把刘少奇永远开除出党的决议，一定要把这个妄图扭转历史车轮的小丑批倒批臭。
