Many units of the People's Liberation Army have started from raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, earnestly implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "further economize and make revolution," and have carried out extensive activities to save coal, powerfully supporting the country's socialist construction. The following are the advanced achievements of several units that have made remarkable progress in this regard.

	Promoting the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and carrying out mass coal-saving activities

	The certain regiment of the Liaoning Provincial Military Region has carried out extensive coal-saving activities, embodying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work. The entire regiment's food coal consumption averages less than one liang per person per day, and heating is entirely done with substitute fuels, saving the country over 3,140 tons of coal.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." To quickly implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "further economize and make revolution," this regiment first addressed the active thoughts of some cadres and soldiers who had insufficient understanding of the significance of saving coal. From the headquarters to the companies, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were universally established. The cadres and soldiers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and his latest series of instructions, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the great traitor, great internal spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, significantly raising everyone's awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The cadres and soldiers consciously regarded saving a piece of coal or a bundle of firewood as implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in action, determined to save more coal and present their loyalty to Chairman Mao.

	The regiment's coal is mainly used for cooking and heating. Previously, the average coal consumption per person per day was over two liang. After the cadres and soldiers raised their awareness, they quickly launched a wave of stove modifications and coal-saving efforts. The soldiers of the Sixth Company's kitchen were dedicated to revolutionary cooking, with an unyielding revolutionary spirit, they conducted over 300 stove modification experiments, reducing coal consumption to less than one liang per person per day. The regimental party committee promptly seized this opportunity to hold a logistics personnel training class, quickly spreading the Sixth Company's experience throughout the regiment, and reducing coal consumption at all food points to less than one liang per person per day. What used to be enough coal for one year is now enough for over a decade.

	The regiment's heating coal consumption was also significant. All cadres and soldiers in the regiment, taking the Third Company as an example, did not ask the state for a single piece of heating coal. From the regimental leaders to the company soldiers, everyone picked up sickles and went to the mountains to collect firewood. This year, the entire regiment used firewood and other fuels for heating, saving the state a large amount of coal.

	Paving a new path for coal conservation with Mao Zedong Thought

	Recently, the kitchen of the Second Machine Gun Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region, inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "further economize and make revolution," overcame numerous difficulties and achieved remarkable results in coal conservation for cooking, reducing coal consumption to an average of eight qian per person per day. Their advanced experience was reported and commended by the unit's logistics department, and the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province held an on-site meeting here to promote their advanced experience.

	This company has been consecutively rated as a "Four Good" company for six years. Under the leadership of the company party branch, the kitchen held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply understanding the great significance of coal conservation. To implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "further economize and make revolution," the kitchen specially sent people to learn from other units, and the company cadres went deep into the kitchen, working with the kitchen soldiers to conduct stove modification experiments. After over 30 experiments, they significantly reduced coal consumption. At this time, some comrades developed a sense of complacency. Addressing this active thought, the party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching on "carrying the revolution through to the end," removing the ideological obstacles to progress, and raising the coal-saving work to a new level. After the new stove was modified, some people placed all their hopes for coal-saving on the stove. Seizing this active thought, the party branch leaders and soldiers together reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching that "weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things," severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's advocacy of "weapon determinism." Through study and criticism, the soldiers became clear-headed, further realizing that: stoves and weapons are both objects, relying on people to master them. Only by arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought and then cooking, can the new stove's effectiveness be fully utilized. They collectively brainstormed and came up with a set of advanced cooking methods, keeping coal consumption stable at eight qian per person per day.

	Using smokeless coal to heat boilers and saving industrial coal for the state

	The certain unit of the Benxi garrison, relying closely on the masses, promoting pioneering spirit, universally promoted the use of smokeless coal to heat boilers, saving the state a large amount of industrial coal.

	As early as the initial period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this unit successfully created the advanced experience of using smokeless coal to heat boilers, breaking the old framework that smokeless coal cannot be used to heat boilers. Since this year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, the broad cadres and soldiers of this unit have demanded that all boilers not yet converted to smokeless coal be changed to use smokeless coal. However, some people thought that the revolutionary production situation on the coal industry front is excellent, the unit has set up a military coal mine, and there is no problem with coal use, so it doesn't matter whether a few boilers are converted or not. The unit's leading organ addressed these active thoughts through education, further raising the broad cadres and soldiers' understanding of the significance of coal conservation. Just at this time, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued. Inspired by the communiqué, the cadres and soldiers actively engaged in the battle of boiler transformation, pooling their wisdom, and converting all boilers to use smokeless coal. Originally, there were two large boilers known as "coal-eating tigers," consuming over 20 tons of coal per day. The cadres and soldiers, with the daring spirit to grab the tiger by the tail, worked day and night, finally tamed these two "coal-eating tigers," significantly reducing coal consumption. This unit also created over a dozen types of smokeless coal heating equipment, which are now universally used for heating with smokeless coal.

    为革命节约用煤
    ——人民解放军节约煤炭的先进事迹
    人民解放军许多部队指战员从提高两条路线斗争的觉悟入手，认真落实伟大领袖毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，深入开展节约煤炭的活动，有力地支援了国家的社会主义建设。这里介绍的是在这方面作出显著成绩的几个单位的先进事迹。发扬艰苦奋斗精神，开展群众性节煤活动
    辽宁省军区某团发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，开展了群众性的节约煤炭活动。全团伙食用煤平均每人每天在一两以下，取暖全部使用代燃品，已经为国家节约煤炭三千一百四十多吨。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”这个团为了迅速落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，首先针对有的干部战士对节约煤炭的意义认识不足的活思想，从机关到连队普遍开办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织指战员反复学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠批大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，大大提高了大家的两条路线斗争的觉悟。指战员们自觉地把节约一块煤、一把柴，看成是落实毛主席的最新指示，捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的实际行动，决心节约更多的煤炭，向毛主席敬献忠心。
    这个团的煤炭主要用于炊事和取暖。以前，平均每人每天用煤都在两斤以上。指战员们认识提高以后，迅速掀起了改灶节煤的热潮。六连炊事班的战士们一心为革命烧火，他们以百折不挠的革命精神，先后经过三百多次改灶试验，使耗煤量下降到每人每天一两以下。团党委及时抓住这个典型，举办后勤人员学习班，使六连的经验很快在全团开花结果，全团所有伙食点耗煤量都降到每人每天一两以下。过去烧一年的煤，够现在烧十几年。
    这个团取暖用煤量也很大，全团干部战士以三连为榜样，不向国家要一块取暖用煤，从团的领导干部到连队战士，都拿起镰刀，上山打柴草。今年全团取暖全部使用柴草等燃料，为国家节省了大量煤炭。
    靠毛泽东思想闯出节约用煤的新路
    最近，北京部队某部机枪二连炊事班在伟大领袖毛主席关于“要进一步节约闹革命”的号召鼓舞下，克服重重困难，在炊事烧煤上创造出每人每天平均用煤八钱的显著成绩，为节约用煤闯出了一条新路。这个部队的后勤部门曾通报表彰了他们的先进事迹，河北省革命委员会还在这里召开了节约用煤的现场会，推广他们的先进经验。
    这个连过去连续六年被评为四好连队。在连队党支部领导下，炊事班认真举办毛泽东思想学习班，深刻认识节约用煤的重大意义。为了落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，做到节约用煤，炊事班特地派人到兄弟单位取经，连队干部也深入灶房，和炊事班战士一起投入改灶试验。他们经过三十多次试验，使耗煤量显著降低。这时，有的同志产生了满于现状的情绪。针对这个活思想，党支部组织大家学习毛主席“将革命进行到底”的教导，排除了前进中的思想障碍，使节煤工作达到了新的水平。新灶改成以后，有人把节煤的希望全部寄托在炉灶上。抓住这种活思想，党支部领导成员又和战士们一起重温毛主席“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物”的教导，狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所鼓吹的“唯武器”论。经过学习和批判，战士们个个心明眼亮，进一步认识到：灶和武器一样，都是物，要靠人去掌握，只有用毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来，再去烧灶，才能充分发挥新灶的作用。他们共同想办法，出主意，总结出一套烧火的先进方法，使耗煤量一直稳定在每人每天八钱。用无烟煤烧取暖锅炉为国家节约工业用煤
    本溪驻军某部，紧密依靠群众，发扬首创精神，普遍推广用无烟煤烧取暖锅炉，为国家节约了大量工业用煤。
    早在无产阶级文化大革命初期，这个部队就成功地创造了用无烟煤烧锅炉的先进经验，从而打破了无烟煤不能烧锅炉的旧框框。今年以来，这个部队的广大指战员在毛主席的一系列最新指示指引下，纷纷要求把没有改烧无烟煤的锅炉统统改成烧无烟煤。但也有人认为，现在煤炭工业战线革命生产形势一片大好，部队又开办了军工采煤场，用煤不成问题，剩下几个锅炉改不改都没关系。部队领导机关针对这些活思想进行了教育，使广大指战员进一步提高了对节约用煤意义的认识。正在这时，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了。指战员们在公报鼓舞下积极投入了改造锅炉的战斗，群策群力，把所有的锅炉都改成烧无烟煤。原来有两个大型锅炉，被称为“吃煤老虎”，每天要耗煤二十多吨。指战员们发扬敢于摸老虎屁股的大无畏精神，日夜奋战，终于把这两只“吃煤老虎”驯服了，大大降低了耗煤量。这个部队还创造了十几种用无烟煤取暖的设备，目前已普遍使用无烟煤取暖。
