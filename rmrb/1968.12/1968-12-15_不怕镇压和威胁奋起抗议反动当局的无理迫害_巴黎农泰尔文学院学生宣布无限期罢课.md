	Paris, December 14 (Xinhua) — French students, undeterred by threats and repression, took to the streets again on December 13 to protest against the atrocities committed by the reactionary authorities against progressive students.

	In May and June of this year, students at Nanterre University in the Paris suburbs first ignited the flames of mass struggle. On December 13, 600 students from this university held a demonstration and march near the university's administrative building to protest against the reactionary school authorities' persecution of students who opposed the decadent educational system. The demonstrators wrote numerous slogans on the university walls condemning the police's suppression of students. On the same day, many teachers at this university also went on strike to show their support for the students' just struggle.

	After the demonstration, the students of Nanterre University held a meeting and announced an indefinite strike, determined to continue the struggle against the persecution of students by the French reactionary authorities to the end.
