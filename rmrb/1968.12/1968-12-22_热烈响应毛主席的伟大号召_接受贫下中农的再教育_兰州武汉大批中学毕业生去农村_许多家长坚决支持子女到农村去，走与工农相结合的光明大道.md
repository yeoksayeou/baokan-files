Lanzhou and Wuhan: Large Numbers of Middle School Graduates Head to the Countryside

Many parents resolutely support their children going to the countryside, walking the bright path of integrating with workers and peasants.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 21: More than 18,000 junior and senior high school graduates in Lanzhou City, with hearts full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have recently been going to the countryside in batches to settle down and accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

Before leaving school, under the leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in the schools, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held. In these classes, they used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, with the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism as the main focus, and thoroughly criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "reading books to become officials," "putting education first," and "going to the countryside to get a gold-plated education." This greatly raised their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness. They deeply realized that Chairman Mao's call for intellectual youth to go to the countryside to settle down and accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is a long-term strategy to prevent revisionism, a fundamental measure to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and an important way to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas. They said that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and walking the path of integrating with workers and peasants is the greatest glory of the youth in the Mao Zedong era. They gathered in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait to express their determination: resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call, going to the countryside, going to the most arduous places, doing revolution for life, walking the path of integrating with workers and peasants for life, and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with practical actions, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Many school graduates who were responsible for the work of the revolutionary committees and Red Guards organizations resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call and took the lead in going to the countryside to settle down. During the process of these graduates going down to the countryside, Lanzhou City's various secondary schools also organized many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams composed of workers' propaganda team members and revolutionary teachers and students to conduct extensive home visits, together with the graduates' parents to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line; and conducted class education on remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness for the students' parents. Through these activities, the class awareness of the students' parents was greatly raised. Many parents expressed their resolute support for their children going to the countryside, walking the bright path of integrating with workers and peasants.

Many counties and rural people's communes in Gansu Province have established special agencies, treating this work as an important political task. Many communes, production brigades, and production teams have also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the theme of settling intellectual youth, making preparations to welcome and settle the intellectual youth from political, ideological, and living aspects.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 21: Under the great encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, more than 20,000 junior and senior high school graduates in Wuhan City have been going to the countryside in batches to settle down, accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, and build socialist new rural areas.

When the first batch of intellectual youth went to the countryside, 80,000 military and civilian personnel in Wuhan held a grand and enthusiastic farewell ceremony. Comrade Fang Ming, the head of the Wuhan Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically praising this batch of intellectual youth for going to the front line of agricultural production and walking the path of integrating with workers and peasants, which is a concrete manifestation of listening to Chairman Mao, being loyal to Chairman Mao, being loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and being loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He encouraged the intellectual youth going up the mountains and down to the countryside to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, humbly learn from poor and lower-middle peasants, and accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

The broad junior and senior high school graduates in the Wuhan area, in order to remove the ideological obstacles of going down to the countryside, used Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party as weapons, extensively and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents' counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, those who labor with their strength are ruled by others," "reading books to become officials," and "achieving fame and fortune," raised their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, and further ignited their hatred for Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and eagerly requested to go to the most arduous and needed places. Many parents regarded sending their children up the mountains and down to the countryside as a concrete action of being loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and eagerly sent their children up the mountains and down to the countryside, letting them accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

In Renhuai County, Guizhou Province, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Changzheng Commune warmly welcomed the intellectual youth to settle down in the countryside. This is the re-education group member, old poor peasant Luo Guoliang, conducting a comparison education of old and new societies for the four intellectual youth living in his home, encouraging them to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to always follow the Communist Party.
