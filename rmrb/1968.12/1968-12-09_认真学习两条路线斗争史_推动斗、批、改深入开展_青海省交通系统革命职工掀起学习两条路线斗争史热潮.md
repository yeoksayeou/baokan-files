The revolutionary cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation System, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have adopted the "three-in-one combination" method to vigorously promote the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. They have deeply criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the party and the nation, significantly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses. They have further implemented the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and have powerfully promoted the struggle, criticism, and reform in their respective units.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be known to the broad revolutionary masses." The Qinghai Provincial Transportation System Revolutionary Committee leads all revolutionary cadres to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings, rapidly initiating a widespread and in-depth movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines throughout the system. Their methods are as follows:

First, combining the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the party with mobilizing the masses to implement the various tasks proposed by the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. The Qinghai Provincial Transportation System Revolutionary Committee recently organized dozens of "three-in-one combination" inspection teams, primarily composed of workers from grassroots units, with support from the PLA's leftist personnel and revolutionary cadres. These teams, using the two-line struggle as the main focus, mutually inspect and exchange the implementation of the various combat tasks proposed by the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and promote the struggle, criticism, and reform. Everywhere the "three-in-one combination" teams go, they actively propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, extensively discuss the history of the two-line struggle within the party, praise Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fiercely criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. This has raised the two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary cadres, promoted the further implementation of the various combat tasks proposed by the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and brought about a new situation in the struggle, criticism, and reform movement throughout the system.

Second, combining the use of revolutionary leading cadres' personal experiences with mass lectures. Various units have universally held lectures on the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the party. During these lectures, they praise Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. Revolutionary old cadres, through their personal experiences, take the lead in discussing the history of the two-line struggle within the party, educating the younger generation to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Shi Zhi Suo, the commander of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the deputy head of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation System Revolutionary Committee, who has fought in the north and south and firmly supported the revolutionary leftists during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, propagates Chairman Mao's revolutionary line wherever he goes. The revolutionary masses praise him as a "fighter defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and an enthusiastic propagandist of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Third, combining the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the party with the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Currently, many units in the Qinghai Provincial Transportation System have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the party as the central content. More than ten units are holding conferences for active participants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Various levels of revolutionary committees are determined to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights, and deeply root the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the minds of the broad revolutionary cadres.

    认真学习两条路线斗争史
    推动斗、批、改深入开展
    青海省交通系统革命职工掀起学习两条路线斗争史热潮
    据新华社西宁电　青海省交通系统革命委员会在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，采取“三个结合”的办法，狠抓两条路线斗争历史的学习运动，深入批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步落实了党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，有力地推动了所属各单位的斗、批、改。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”青海省交通系统革命委员会领导全体革命职工认真学习毛主席这一教导，在全系统迅速掀起了广泛深入的学习两条路线斗争史的热潮，他们的作法是：
    一，把学习党内两条路线斗争的历史与发动群众落实党的十二中全会提出的各项任务相结合。青海省交通系统革委会，最近组织了几十个以基层单位的工人为主体，有解放军支左人员和革命干部参加的“三结合”检查小组，以两条路线斗争为纲，相互检查、交流落实党的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，开展斗、批、改的情况。“三结合”小组每到一处，就积极宣传毛主席的最新指示，并和广大革命群众一起，大讲党内两条路线斗争的历史，大颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，提高了广大革命职工两条路线斗争的觉悟，推动了党的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务的进一步落实，使全系统的斗、批、改运动出现了新气象。
    二，采用革命领导干部现身说法与群众性的讲用相结合。各单位普遍召开党内两条路线斗争史学习的讲用会。讲用会上，大颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线。革命的老干部以自己的亲身体会，带头讲党内两条路线斗争的历史，教育年青一代，要永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。曾经转战南北、在无产阶级文化大革命中坚定地支持革命左派的人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队队长、省交通系统革委会副主任史之锁同志，走到那里，就把毛主席革命路线宣传到那里。革命群众赞扬他是“捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗员，热情宣传毛主席革命路线的宣传员”。
    三，把学习党内两条路线斗争史与活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动相结合。现在，青海省交通系统不少单位举办了以学习党内两条路线斗争史为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，有十多个单位正在召开活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表会议。各级革委会决心继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新高潮，使战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在广大革命职工头脑中深深扎根。
