The People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed at the Red Flag Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "practice economy in running all state enterprises and cooperative enterprises," enthusiastically assisted the revolutionary committee in launching a thorough revolutionary criticism, mobilizing the workers to carry out technological innovations and technological revolutions, and actively doing a good job in saving and substituting timber, thus saving a large amount of funds for the state.

To implement the saving and substitution of timber, what force should be relied on? At the beginning, the revolutionary committee had a few technical personnel in charge of production sit in the office to calculate how much timber could be saved in this working face and how much in that heading. However, no matter how they calculated, they could not find much potential. Where was the potential? The propaganda team of the PLA stationed at the mine and the members of the revolutionary committee reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history," and went deep into the masses to mobilize the people. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instruction to "save money and make revolution," and explained the significance of saving and substituting timber. At the same time, together with the broad masses of workers, they severely criticized the traitor and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents for pushing the revisionist line of "pursuing big and foreign things," "wastefulness," "control, restrict, fine, and punish" in running enterprises, which deeply educated everyone.

On the basis of thoroughly carrying out revolutionary criticism, the propaganda team of the PLA stationed at the mine and the revolutionary committee firmly relied on the broad masses of workers, fully exerted the leadership role of the working class, and universally reformed all unreasonable rules and regulations, enabling the workers to directly manage and use the timber, thus extending the service life of the timber. Previously, one worker could only saw nine cubic meters of timber in a shift, but now one worker can saw eighteen cubic meters in a shift. In timber management, many "red stewards" emerged. This year, the workers in the entire mine saved and substituted a total of 1,128 cubic meters of timber by rationally changing the sawing of timber and recycling black timber, saving a large amount of funds for the state and solving the key problems in production.

The revolutionary committee and the propaganda team of the PLA stationed at the mine also established a "three-in-one combination" technological revolution small group consisting mainly of workers, with revolutionary technical personnel and revolutionary leading cadres participating, to carry out technological innovations and thoroughly reform the underground timber problem. In the movement to carry out technological innovations and save timber, the veteran worker Yan Bin and other workers, after repeated research and discussion, came up with a plan to cancel the wooden shed at the working face and replace it with metal supports. A small clique of capitalist roaders in the mine, whose hearts were not yet dead, maliciously said that "the miner's lamp is the worker's eye, and the timber is the worker's courage. If the working face does not use timber, it is equivalent to taking away the worker's courage," attempting to incite some people to oppose the plan proposed by Comrade Yan Bin and the workers. However, the workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, after repeated experiments, successfully used metal beams to completely replace the timber, achieving a "timberless working face," saving a large amount of funds for the state, and making a significant contribution to the development of the coal industry.

    峰峰矿务局红旗矿充分发挥工人阶级领导作用
    大搞技术革新节约坑木获得很大成绩
    本报讯　人民解放军驻峰峰矿务局红旗矿毛泽东思想宣传队，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业”的教导，热情帮助矿革委会从深入开展革命大批判入手，发动工人群众，大闹技术革新和技术革命，积极做好坑木节约代用工作，为国家节约了大量资金。
    实行坑木节约代用，依靠什么力量？开始，革委会让几个管理生产的技术人员坐在办公室里算账，看看这个掌子面能省多少坑木，那个掘进头能省多少坑木，可是算来算去，总是挖不出多大油水。到底潜力在那里？驻矿解放军宣传队和革委会成员重温了毛主席关于“人民群众有无限的创造力”的教导，纷纷深入到群众中去，发动群众，反复学习毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，宣讲坑木节约代用的意义。同时和广大工人群众一起，狠批了大叛徒刘少奇及其代理人推行的“贪大求洋”“铺张浪费”“管、卡、扣、罚”等反革命修正主义办企业路线，使大家受到了深刻的教育。
    在深入开展革命大批判的基础上，驻矿解放军宣传队和革委会坚决依靠广大工人群众，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，对一切不合理的规章制度普遍进行了改革，使工人直接掌握了坑木的管理和使用，提高了坑木的效用期。以前，一个工一班才锯九立米坑木，现在，一个工一班能锯十八立米坑木。在坑木管理上出现许多“红管家”。今年，全矿工人合理改锯涨材坑木和回收的黑坑木共一千一百二十八立米，为国家节约了大量的资金，解决了生产中的关键问题。
    革委会和驻矿解放军宣传队还成立了一个以工人为主体的有革命技术人员、革命领导干部参加的“三结合”技术革命小组，大搞技术革新，彻底改革井下坑木问题。在大搞技术革新、节约坑木运动中，老工人严斌和其他工人经过反复研究、讨论，想出了一个工作面取消机头木棚换成金属支柱的方案。矿上一小撮走资派贼心不死，胡说什么“矿灯是工人的眼，坑木是工人的胆，掌子面不使用坑木就等于抽去了工人的胆”，企图煽动一些人反对严斌同志和工人们提出的方案。可是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，经过反复试验，成功地用金属梁全部代替坑木，实现了“无坑木工作面”，为国家节约了大量资金，为煤炭工业的发展做出了重大贡献。
