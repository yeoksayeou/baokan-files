The working class of our county, in leading the educational revolution in urban areas, has, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, smashed the old educational system. They have adopted a new system for urban schools that includes zonal management, factory-school integration, and facing toward the countryside.

	Urban Communes to Take Unified Leadership

Since March of this year, the county revolutionary committee has successively decided to transfer all urban primary and secondary schools to the management of the Cheng'an Commune. To grasp the power of urban education, the Cheng'an Commune has established an education revolutionary committee with workers as the main body, which operates under the leadership of the commune revolutionary committee. The education revolutionary committee is composed of seventeen people, including six representatives from the worker propaganda teams stationed in the schools, three representatives from poor and lower-middle peasants, as well as representatives from the militia and revolutionary students and teachers. The commune revolutionary committee has dispatched a deputy director to serve as the director of the education revolutionary committee.

The commune education revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's directive to "shorten the school system and revolutionize education," has converted the original six primary and secondary schools into nine-year unified schools. The teaching staff has also been reorganized, expelling class enemies who had infiltrated the teaching ranks. The remaining teachers have been divided into two groups: one group has been sent to the production front to participate in labor and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers; the other group continues to work in the schools to carry out the educational revolution. To change the composition of the teaching staff, the commune education revolutionary committee has hired more than fifty outstanding workers, peasants, and soldiers with practical experience to serve as teachers or part-time teachers.

	Zonal Management Based on Neighborhoods

Based on the urgent demands of the broad masses and the distribution of factories and schools, we have divided Cheng'an into six school districts, with each district managing one school and having one or two factories within the district. Each district, with the factory as the main body, selects representatives from the factory, neighborhood, and school to form a district education revolutionary committee, replacing the principal's responsibility system, and directly manages the schools under the leadership of the commune education revolutionary committee.

	Study, Work, and Farm, Face Toward the Countryside

Cheng'an is a small county town that directly serves agricultural production. Except for a small number of students who will remain in the city's industrial and commercial sectors and service industries, the majority will go to the agricultural frontline to engage in agricultural production. To face toward the countryside, teachers and students in the schools spend one-quarter of their time each year participating in industrial production, especially agricultural production labor. Since August, all schools in the town have been doing this.

Revolutionary teachers and students go to factories and rural areas to participate in the three great revolutionary movements, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, significantly enhance their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, and strengthen their love for the working people. Students who participate in labor in factories are assigned to fixed workshops and teams, forming "one-to-one red" pairs with workers. Many have also learned simple skills such as agricultural machinery repair and machine operation. Over a thousand revolutionary teachers and students who work in rural areas are assigned to fixed production teams, eating, living, working, studying, and criticizing together with poor and lower-middle peasants. Some have even uncovered the class struggle in the production brigade with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants also actively conduct Mao Zedong Thought education and bitter-sweet education for the revolutionary teachers and students. Through joint struggle and practice, revolutionary teachers and students have established deep class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "These students are not only propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought but also labor experts. They are versatile, and we genuinely like them from the bottom of our hearts." The revolutionary youngsters also deeply feel: "In the past, we were always stuck in the city and the school, with no feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants; now, after experiencing wind and rain in the countryside and seeing the world, we have a special affection for the poor and lower-middle peasants." Many students have expressed that after graduation, they will definitely go to the countryside to settle down and work for the construction of socialist new rural areas for life.

    城镇学校要面向农村
    我县工人阶级在领导城镇教育革命过程中，以彻底革命精神，砸烂了旧的教育制度，对城镇学校采用了分区管理、厂校结合、面向农村的新体制。
    由城镇公社实行统一领导
    今年三月以来，县革委会相继决定把城镇中小学全部下放给庆安镇管理。为了掌好城镇教育大权，庆安镇公社成立了以工人为主体的教育革命委员会，在公社革委会领导下进行工作。教育革命委员会由十七人组成，其中有进驻学校的工人宣传队代表六人，贫下中农代表三人，还有民兵、革命师生代表参加，公社革委会派一名副主任担当教育革命委员会主任。
    公社教育革命委员会遵循毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的教导，把原有的六所中小学一律改为九年一贯制学校。对教师队伍也进行了整顿，把混进教师队伍中的阶级敌人清除了出去。其余的教师，一部分到生产第一线参加劳动，接受工农兵的再教育；一部分继续留在学校，进行教育革命。为了改变教师队伍的成份，公社教育革命委员会聘请了五十多名有实践经验的工农兵优秀分子担任教师或兼职教师。
    以街道为学区，实行分区管理
    根据广大群众的迫切要求和工厂、学校分布的情况，我们把庆安镇划为六个学区，每个学区管一所学校，各区内都有一、二个工厂。各区以工厂为主，由工厂、街道、学校选出代表组成学区教育革命委员会，取代学校的校长负责制，在公社教育革命委员会的领导下，直接管理学校。
    学工学农，面向农村
    庆安镇是一个直接服务于农业生产的小县城，培养的学生除极少数将留在城里的工商业和服务行业劳动外，绝大部分要到农业第一线去从事农业生产劳动。为了面向农村，学校师生每年要有四分之一的时间参加工业生产特别是农业生产的劳动。从八月份以来，全镇各学校已经这样做。
    革命师生到工厂、农村参加三大革命运动，接受工农兵的再教育，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，增强了热爱劳动人民的思想感情。在工厂参加劳动的师生，固定车间，固定班组，同工人结成一帮一的“一对红”。许多人还学会了简单的农机修理、机床操作等技术。在农村劳动的一千多名革命师生，固定社队，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同批判，有的还和贫下中农一起，揭开了大队阶级斗争的盖子。贫下中农也主动对革命师生进行毛泽东思想教育、忆苦思甜教育。在共同的斗争实践中，革命师生同贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情。贫下中农说：“这些学生既是毛泽东思想宣传员，又是劳动能手，要文有文，要武有武，我们打心眼里喜欢他们。”革命小将也深有感触地说：“过去成天蹲在城里，闷在学校，和贫下中农没感情；现在到农村经风雨，见世面，与贫下中农格外亲。”许多学生表示，毕业后一定要到农村去安家落户，为建设社会主义新农村干一辈子。
