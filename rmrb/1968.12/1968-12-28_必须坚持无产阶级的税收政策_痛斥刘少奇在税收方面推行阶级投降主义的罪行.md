Socialist taxation is a means by which the working class struggles against the bourgeoisie. The great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi has consistently opposed the revolutionary line of our great leader Chairman Mao in matters of taxation, pushing a counter-revolutionary line of class capitulation. His serious crimes in this regard must be exposed and criticized.

The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the basic conclusion of the new democratic revolution in China and the beginning of the socialist revolution.

In March 1949, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "After the victory of the Chinese revolution nationwide, the basic contradiction within the country is between the working class and the bourgeoisie." We must learn to wage political, economic, and cultural struggles against the bourgeoisie. "We must adopt a policy of restricting private capitalism." Chairman Mao also clearly pointed out that taxation policy is one aspect of restricting capitalism. Chairman Mao's instructions on this point set a glorious and arduous task for socialist taxation in utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce.

However, the great saboteur Liu Shaoqi, starting from the counter-revolutionary goal of developing capitalism, vigorously opposed Chairman Mao's instructions on taxation. Just over a month after the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he rushed to Tianjin and other places, kneeling before the capitalists and distorting the truth by saying that taxation is the state "exploiting the capitalists." He also said that "taxation is too heavy" and asked the capitalists to "suggest a new tax rate table," urging the government and capitalists to "discuss together." Soon after, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Ministry of Finance seized the opportunity of "adjusting taxation" to collude with the capitalist leaders. In June 1950, they openly raised the black banner of "joint taxation administration," demanding that capitalists and the government "jointly discuss and share responsibility" to improve taxation work. Different words, same meaning. The black banner of "joint taxation administration" originated from Liu Shaoqi's "discuss together." This is a conspiracy by Liu Shaoqi and his ilk to oppose the restriction of capitalism and attempt to overthrow proletarian dictatorship.

The so-called "discuss together" and "joint taxation administration" aim to revise tax laws according to the wishes of the capitalists, handing over the proletarian taxation policy to the bourgeoisie for approval. This is a blatant challenge to Chairman Mao's great teachings on restricting capitalism through taxation! In essence, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices want the working class to hand over the leadership of taxation to the bourgeoisie, turning this weapon for restricting capitalism and developing socialism into a tool for developing capitalism and restricting socialism. This is intolerable!

To cover up the reactionary nature of "joint taxation administration," Liu Shaoqi fabricated an extremely reactionary public opinion, claiming that capitalists have become honest, no longer falsifying accounts or evading taxes, and now have "one book instead of two." Have the capitalists really changed from "two books to one"? Despite Liu Shaoqi's shameless beautification and praise of the bourgeoisie, the nature of the bourgeoisie does not change. Since the liberation of the whole country, has there been a day when the bourgeoisie did not falsify accounts or evade taxes? The "Five Antis" campaign in 1952 exposed their massive crimes of bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work, and stealing state economic intelligence, which are irrefutable evidence.

Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, in the great "Five Antis" campaign of 1952, the working class repelled the bourgeoisie's fierce attacks on the Party and socialism, and Liu Shaoqi's line of capitulation in "joint taxation administration" was struck a heavy blow.

In 1953, the entire Party was fully implementing Chairman Mao's general line for the transitional period, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce entered a new stage.

The brilliant general line shone like a lighthouse, illuminating the broad path of socialism. However, Liu Shaoqi was not willing to accept his failure. Under his instructions, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Ministry of Finance, using the pretext of revising the tax system, secretly agreed with the capitalist leaders according to his reactionary theory of "parallel development of public and private economies," and on January 1, 1953, issued a capitulationist program of "equal taxation for public and private sectors," stipulating that state-owned and private economies should receive "equal treatment" in tax burdens.

The state-owned economy is the lifeline of New China and the leading component of the entire national economy. Therefore, our taxation policy must be conducive to the rapid development of the state-owned economy. We cannot have "equal taxation for public and private sectors," and we cannot allow private economies to enjoy the same tax treatment as state-owned economies. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his accomplices issued this reactionary taxation program with the evil intention of opposing the Party's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through taxation policy, sabotaging the implementation of the general line for the transitional period, and attempting to develop capitalism and establish bourgeois dictatorship.

How can an ant shake a tree? After the issuance of the capitulationist program of "equal taxation for public and private sectors," it was immediately discovered by our great leader Chairman Mao. In July 1953, the National Financial and Economic Conference affirmed that taxation must implement the policy principle of "distinguishing between public and private sectors," seriously criticizing the capitulationist program of "equal taxation for public and private sectors" pushed by the great saboteur Liu Shaoqi and his gang.

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in 1956, class struggle still existed. In his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," our great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense."

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, taxation work must still adhere to the leadership of the working class, take class struggle as the key link, highlight proletarian politics, actively support the development of the socialist economy, and prevent the restoration of capitalism. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi brazenly advocated the theory of "extinction of class struggle." He ranted that "the main contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved," and shouted that "many measures used during the period of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist enterprises must be changed." The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Ministry of Finance also followed suit, advocating that "the class struggle function of taxation has basically disappeared."

What "the class struggle function of taxation has basically disappeared"? Just because the ownership of the means of production has been transformed, does that mean there are no more classes and class struggle? This is to remove the soul of class struggle from taxation work, to make tax officials forget class struggle, and to make the working class abandon its dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in taxation, opening the door wide for the restoration of capitalism.

In 1962, when our national economy faced temporary difficulties, Liu Shaoqi, in collusion with all the ghosts and snakes at home and abroad, fiercely opposed the Three Red Banners, vigorously advocated "three selfs and one package," spread the wind of individual farming, and vigorously promoted the free market, shielding and nurturing old and new bourgeois elements. He even claimed that "it is not scary if some bourgeois elements emerge in society," and even went so far as to say that "licenses can be issued to speculators." This is extremely reactionary! According to Liu Shaoqi's black intentions, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Ministry of Finance even reduced taxes for speculators and peddlers, and even withdrew grassroots tax officials from the front line of market management. The measures taken in taxation, in essence, were to cooperate with the black wind of "three selfs and one package," sabotage the socialist market, and undermine the socialist economic foundation. In a word, Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices wanted to undermine the foundations of socialism, allowing urban and rural capitalist forces to run rampant.

At this time of chaos, in the autumn of 1962, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" and proposed the great task of carrying out the socialist education movement, sounding the charge for the proletariat to counterattack the bourgeoisie. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the socialist education movement achieved great results, and the capitalist forces suffered a heavy blow, with bourgeois elements and speculators falling into the vast ocean of people's war. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi, the number one capitalist-roader, once again suffered a humiliating failure in his evil plot to restore capitalism.

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by Liu Shaoqi. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and, in the great upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation, further deepen the criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    必须坚持无产阶级的税收政策
    ——痛斥刘少奇在税收方面推行阶级投降主义的罪行
    红财兵
    社会主义税收是工人阶级向资产阶级进行斗争的一个手段。大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在税收方面一贯反对伟大领袖毛主席的革命路线，推行反革命的阶级投降主义路线。对于他的这一严重罪行，必须揭发批判。
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国新民主主义革命基本结束和社会主义革命的开始。
    伟大领袖毛主席在一九四九年三月党的七届二中全会的报告中教导我们：中国革命在全国胜利以后，国内的基本矛盾就是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”，必须学会向资产阶级“作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争”，“对于私人资本主义采取限制政策”。毛主席并且明确指出，税收政策是限制资本主义的一个方面。毛主席的这一指示，对社会主义税收在利用、限制、改造资本主义工商业的问题上，提出了光荣而艰巨的任务。
    但是，大工贼刘少奇从发展资本主义的反革命目标出发，竭力反对毛主席在税收方面的指示。党的七届二中全会闭幕才一个多月，他就迫不及待地跑到天津等地，向资本家屈膝跪拜，颠倒黑白地说什么征税是国家“剥削了资本家”。又说什么“税收重了”，请资本家“提议个新的税率表”，要政府和资本家“大家商量”。接着，财政部党内一小撮走资派抓住“调整税收”的机会，同资本家的头面人物互相串通，于一九五○年六月，公开打出“共商办税”的黑旗，要求资本家和政府“共同商讨，大家负责”，搞好税收工作。不同的词句，同一个含义。“共商办税”这面黑旗，就是源出刘少奇的“大家商量”。这是刘少奇之流反对限制资本主义、妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的一个阴谋。
    所谓“大家商量”、“共商办税”，就是要按照资本家的意旨，修订税收法令，把无产阶级的税收政策交给资产阶级审定。这是明目张胆地对抗毛主席在税收方面要限制资本主义的伟大教导！拆穿了说，大叛徒刘少奇及其同伙就是要我们工人阶级把税收的领导权拱手交给资产阶级，把税收这个限制资本主义、发展社会主义的武器，变为发展资本主义、限制社会主义的工具。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    刘少奇为了掩盖“共商办税”的反动本质，还捏造出一种极端反动的舆论。说什么资本家老实了，不造假账、不偷税漏税了，现在“两本账变为一本账”了。资本家真的把“两本账变为一本账”了吗！？尽管大工贼刘少奇厚颜无耻地美化、吹捧资产阶级，但是资产阶级的本性是不会改变的。全国解放以后，资产阶级有那一天不造假账、不偷税漏税呢？一九五二年的“五反”斗争揭发出他们大量的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的“五毒”罪行，就是无可辩驳的铁证。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在一九五二年伟大的“五反”斗争中，工人阶级打退了资产阶级向党、向社会主义的猖狂进攻，刘少奇及其同伙“共商办税”的投降主义路线遭到了迎头痛击。
    一九五三年，全党正在全面贯彻执行毛主席提出的过渡时期总路线，党对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造开始进入了新的阶段。
    光芒四射的总路线象灯塔一样照亮了社会主义的广阔道路。然而，刘少奇并不甘心于自己的失败。在他的指使下，财政部党内一小撮走资派以修正税制为名，按照他的公私经济“平行发展”的反动理论，背着伟大领袖毛主席，又与资产阶级头面人物私下协议，于一九五三年一月一日抛出一个“公私一律平等纳税”的投降主义纲领，规定国营经济和私营经济在税收负担上实行“同等待遇”。
    国营经济是新中国的经济命脉，是整个国民经济的领导成分。因此，我们的税收政策必须有利于国营经济的迅速发展。我们决不能搞什么“公私一律平等纳税”，决不能让私营经济在税收负担上享有国营经济的同等待遇。党内头号走资派刘少奇及其同伙，抛出反动的税收纲领，其罪恶目的，就是要从税收政策上对抗党对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，破坏过渡时期总路线的贯彻执行，妄图发展资本主义，建立资产阶级专政。
    蚍蜉撼树谈何易。“公私一律平等纳税”这个投降主义纲领出笼后，立即被我们伟大领袖毛主席发现了。一九五三年七月，全国财经会议肯定了税收必须贯彻“公私区别对待”的政策原则，严肃批判了大工贼刘少奇一伙推行的“公私一律平等纳税”的投降主义纲领。
    一九五六年，生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，阶级斗争依然存在。伟大领袖毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉文献里明确指出：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    遵照毛主席的教导，税收工作仍然必须坚持工人阶级的领导，以阶级斗争为纲，突出无产阶级政治，积极支持社会主义经济发展，防止资本主义复辟。而大叛徒刘少奇却放肆地宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”。他胡说什么“无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了”，叫嚷什么“在利用、限制、改造资本主义企业时期所采用的许多措施，现在必须改变”。财政部党内一小撮走资派也跟着宣扬什么“税收的阶级斗争作用基本消失了”。
    什么“税收的阶级斗争作用基本消失了”！改造了生产资料所有制，难道阶级和阶级斗争就没有了吗？这是要税收工作抽去阶级斗争的灵魂，要税务干部忘记阶级斗争，要工人阶级在税收上放弃对资产阶级专政，为资本主义复辟大开方便之门。
    一九六二年我国国民经济遭到暂时困难，刘少奇和国内外一切牛鬼蛇神相呼应，疯狂反对三面红旗，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”，大刮单干风，竭力吹捧自由市场，拚命庇护和扶植新老资产阶级分子，叫嚷对“投机的人可发（执）照”，并且扬言“社会上产生一些资产阶级分子，并不可怕”。真是反动透顶！根据刘少奇的黑意旨，财政部党内一小撮走资派竟然在税收上对投机商贩作了大幅度的减税“照顾”，甚至把基层税务干部从市场管理的第一线撤了下来。税收上采取的这些措施，说穿了，就是为了配合“三自一包”的黑风，破坏社会主义市场，瓦解社会主义经济基础。一句话，刘少奇及其同伙就是要挖社会主义的墙脚，让城乡资本主义势力泛滥成灾。
    就在这群魔乱舞的时候，一九六二年秋，伟大领袖毛主席发出“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，提出了要进行社会主义教育运动的伟大任务，吹响了无产阶级向资产阶级反击的进军号。在毛主席的英明领导下，社会主义教育运动取得了伟大成果，资本主义势力遭到了沉重打击，资产阶级分子和投机倒把分子陷入了人民战争的汪洋大海之中。刘少奇这个头号走资派妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，又一次遭到了可耻的失败。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底摧毁了以刘少奇为首的资产阶级司令部。我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在伟大的斗、批、改的高潮中，进一步深入批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
