Chairman Mao has recently given us new instructions: "It is necessary for young intellectuals to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants." I have repeatedly studied this latest instruction. Reflecting on the ten years I have spent, I deeply feel that it is necessary for intellectuals to combine with the workers and peasants and receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This has further strengthened my resolve to dedicate myself to the revolution in the countryside.

Listening to Chairman Mao's Words, Settling in the Countryside

I grew up in Shanghai. My family has six members, and both my parents are workers. In the autumn of 1957, after graduating from junior high school, I studied Chairman Mao's great teachings about young intellectuals going to the countryside and mountains: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What is the criterion for judging? There is only one criterion, that is, to see whether he is willing to and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing to and actually combine with the workers and peasants are revolutionary; otherwise, they are not revolutionary or even counter-revolutionary." He also said, "The countryside is a vast world where one can do great things." Chairman Mao's great teachings gave me great strength, and I decided to settle in the countryside.

I told my parents about my determination to become a farmer. My father supported me, saying, "Young people should go to the countryside to temper themselves and learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants." However, my mother couldn't understand it at first and started crying. At this time, my father called a family meeting to recall past hardships and present joys. At the family meeting, my father denounced the evil old society, recounted our family's miserable experiences before liberation, and pointed to a scar on his leg, saying, "This is evidence of our miserable life before liberation. Chairman Mao led us poor people to stand up. We must not forget our past sufferings and make our children forget their roots." After recalling and comparing, Mother's thoughts changed. Father also repeatedly instructed me, "After you go to the countryside, you must listen to Chairman Mao's words. When you encounter difficulties, think of Chairman Mao's teachings and the old society. Don't forget that you are a daughter of the working class and that you have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought." In May 1958, I happily settled in the countryside of Hubei Province.

Receiving Re-education from Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Thoroughly Transforming My Worldview

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." The poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, stand most firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and walk most resolutely on the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao. They are my good teachers and my good examples to learn from.

When I first came to the Tiemen Commune's Third Brigade, I did not have this understanding. At that time, it was the hottest days of summer, with the sun scorching from above and the heat rising from below. After a day's labor, my back and waist ached, and I still had to go home to cook, feeling that I couldn't take it anymore.

The first time I transplanted rice seedlings, I struggled to push the seedlings into the mud, taking a long time to plant just one seedling, and they were planted crookedly without any order. When it was dark and time to stop work, I lay on the bed thinking about the scenes in Shanghai. But I immediately realized that this was a manifestation of longing for city life and fearing hard work, so I immediately got up and opened Chairman Mao's works. Several lines of golden, shining characters appeared before me: "He combines with the workers and peasants today; he is revolutionary today. But if he does not combine with them tomorrow, or even oppresses the people, then he is not revolutionary or even counter-revolutionary." Chairman Mao's instructions were like a bright lamp, illuminating my heart. I thought, I have just come to Tiemen Commune to be a farmer, and I am already wavering. This shows that I have not yet put down the airs of an intellectual, and there is still a great distance between me and the poor and lower-middle peasants in terms of ideology, emotion, and life. Thinking of this, I decided to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and work hard to transform my worldview, undergoing a thorough transformation.

The first time I carried manure, my shoulders were red and swollen, and they hurt and itched. I thought, labor is really hard! Should I carry it tomorrow? At this time, many poor and lower-middle peasants encouraged me, saying, "Everyone has to go through this. Don't worry, keep carrying, and your shoulders will get calloused and won't hurt anymore. If you carry for a day and rest for a few days, your shoulders will feel better, but you will never get over this hurdle." So, I persisted, and after just seven or eight days, my shoulders really didn't hurt anymore. Poor peasant member Tang Shenghong always picked up every grain of rice and every cotton flower and put them in the warehouse during threshing. The poor and lower-middle peasants' lofty qualities of loving the collective and loving labor are always teaching me. I also paid attention to learning from them, observing and remembering. Once, when carrying manure, I also went barefoot and rolled up my pants, working just like them. I truly felt that "the cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals."

Being Tempered in the Storms of Class Struggle

In 1966, after the great socialist education movement, due to the needs of revolutionary work, I was assigned to work in the commune, and my responsibilities became heavier. I needed to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively and participate in production labor, not being able to leave the masses for a moment. However, it was on this very issue that there was a sharp class struggle. Once, after laboring, a landlord element hypocritically said, "Now that you are a commune cadre, your main job is 'organization and leadership.' You don't need to work so hard. You should wear a watch and dress in nice clothes, looking like a cadre." I was shocked to hear this. How could this villain be so hypocritically "concerned" about me? Isn't this class struggle? I immediately became alert, thinking, the class enemy is so cunning. I have just come to the commune, and the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets have already been fired at me, trying to pull me down, making me leave the poor and lower-middle peasants and leave labor. I immediately exposed this landlord's plot, saying, "I am armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a descendant of the working class, a daughter of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and I will not fall for your tricks!" I originally thought that after the socialist education movement, the class enemies had been struck down and would not dare to cause trouble anymore, and my thoughts were a bit complacent. Now I understand that class struggle is not something that can be changed by one's will. I opened the red book and once again seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "After our basic victory in the socialist revolution, there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They will fight against the working class from all sides, including ideological struggle." Through this incident, I deeply felt the great truth of "never forgetting class struggle." In the great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao, I, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, held high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and fought against the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his lackeys like Wang Renzhong in Hubei, bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Looking back on the ten years I have spent, I have transformed from a city girl who didn't know the difference between grains to a Communist Party member, a representative of the provincial poor peasants' association, and an active learner and applier of Chairman Mao's works. This is the result of reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and it is also the result of the poor and lower-middle peasants re-educating me. How can I not shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever! I wish Chairman Mao a long life! Long life! I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and temper and transform myself in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, advancing on the road of combining with the workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao!

    插队落户接受贫下中农的再教育
    湖北省麻城县铁门公社革委会委员、上山下乡知识青年　汪慧英
    毛主席最近又一次教导我们：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。”我反复地学习了这条最新指示。回顾我十年来所走过的道路，深深体会到知识分子与工农群众相结合，接受贫下中农的再教育，是很必要的，更加坚定了我在农村干一辈子革命的决心。
    听毛主席的话，到农村落户
    我是在上海长大的。家里有六口人，父母亲都是工人。一九五七年秋季，我初中毕业后，学习了毛主席关于知识青年下乡上山的伟大教导：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”又说：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”毛主席的伟大教导，给了我很大力量，我决心到农村插队落户。
    我把当农民的决心告诉了父母亲。父亲很支持。他说：“年轻人就应该到农村去锻炼，向贫下中农学习。”可是母亲一时想不通，就哭起来了。这时，父亲就开了个家庭会，忆苦思甜。在家庭会上，父亲控诉了万恶的旧社会，叙述了我家解放前的苦难遭遇，他指着腿上的一块伤疤说：“这就是解放前苦难生活的见证。毛主席领导我们穷苦人翻了身，我们不要好了伤疤忘了痛，使孩子忘了本。”经过回忆对比，妈妈的思想通了。父亲还一再嘱咐我：“你到农村后，一定要好好听毛主席的话，遇到困难，就想想毛主席的教导，想想旧社会，不要忘记自己是工人阶级的女儿，不要忘记你是在毛泽东思想哺育下长大的。”一九五八年五月，我便愉快地到湖北省农村安家落户了。
    接受贫下中农再教育，彻底改造世界观
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”贫下中农最听毛主席的话，最坚决地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，最坚决地走毛主席所指引的社会主义道路。他们是我的好老师，是我学习的好榜样。
    我刚到铁门公社三大队的时候，并不是这样认识的。那时正是三伏天，头上太阳晒，脚下热气蒸，劳动一天之后，腰酸背痛，还要回家烧火做饭，就感到受不了。
    第一次插二季稻秧，我使劲把秧朝泥巴里塞，好半天才插一棵，而且还插得无行无路，东倒西歪。天黑放工回家，我躺在床上想起了上海的情景。但是，我马上意识到，这是一种留恋城市生活，害怕艰苦劳动的表现，便立刻起来，打开毛主席著作，几行金光闪闪的大字，出现在我的面前：“他今天把自己结合于工农群众，他今天是革命的；但是如果他明天不去结合了，或者反过来压迫老百姓，那就是不革命的，或者是反革命的了。”毛主席的指示象一盏明灯，照亮了我的心。我想，我到铁门公社来当农民，刚刚开始，怎么就动摇起来了呢？说明我还没有放下知识分子的架子，在思想上、感情上、生活上和贫下中农还有很大的距离。想到这里，我决心向贫下中农学习，在改造世界观方面，狠下功夫，来一个脱胎换骨的改造。
    第一次挑送土粪，我肩头压得又红又肿，又辣又痛。我想劳动关真难过呀！明天还挑不挑呢？这时，许多贫下中农鼓励我说，人人都有这一关，不要紧，坚持挑，肩上磨起茧子来就好了。要是挑一天歇几天，肩膀虽然好过一点，但永远也过不了这一关。于是，我坚持下去，只过七八天，果然肩膀就再也不痛了。贫农社员唐胜洪，每次打场时，一粒谷子，一朵棉花，他都要拣到仓库去。贫下中农热爱集体、热爱劳动的崇高品质，时刻都在给我上课。我也处处留心向他们学习，看在眼里，记在心里。有次挑大粪，我也打赤脚，挽裤腿，和他们一样干。我真正体会到：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼自己
    一九六六年，经过伟大的社会主义教育运动，由于革命工作的需要，我被分配到公社工作，担子更重了，更需要活学活用毛主席著作，坚持参加生产劳动，一刻也不能脱离群众。可是，就是在这个问题上，还有一场尖锐的阶级斗争。有一次，我劳动回来，一个地主分子假惺惺地说：“你现在当了公社干部，主要是
  ‘组织领导’，不要那样使劲劳动了。手表也应该戴起来，好衣服也要穿着，要象个干部的样子。”我听了心里一惊，这个坏蛋怎么这样殷勤地“关心”我呢？这难道不是阶级斗争吗？我立刻警惕起来，心想，阶级敌人真毒辣，我刚到公社，资产阶级糖衣炮弹就打过来了，想把我拉下水，让我脱离贫下中农，脱离劳动。我当场戳穿了这个地主分子的阴谋诡计，说：“我是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级的后代，是贫下中农的女儿，决不能上你的当！”我原来以为刚刚经过社会主义教育运动，阶级敌人受到了打击，不敢再胡作非为了，思想上有点麻痹，现在才懂得阶级斗争是不依人的意志为转移的。我打开红色宝书，又一次认真学习了毛主席的教导：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”经过这件事，使我更加深刻地体会到“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大真理。在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我和广大贫下中农一起，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，大造了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和他在湖北的代理人王任重之流的反，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    回顾十年来所走过的道路，使我由一个五谷不分的城市姑娘，成为一个共产党员、省贫协代表、活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，这是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的结果，也是贫下中农对我进行再教育的结果。我怎能不千遍万遍地高呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！我一定遵照毛主席的最新指示，接受贫下中农的再教育，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，锻炼自己，改造自己，沿着毛主席指引的与工农群众相结合的道路前进！
