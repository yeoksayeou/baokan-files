Our great teacher Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be known by the broad revolutionary masses."

Repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, in conjunction with our platoon's growth and development under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we deeply understand: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are extremely wise and correct. Only by repeatedly conducting education on the struggle between the two lines and continuously raising the awareness of cadres and soldiers in this struggle can we ensure that the platoon always advances victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Over the past decade, our platoon has always been stationed at the frontline of class struggle against the enemy on the border, bearing the responsibility of defending the border and the red land of the proletariat. We have to deal with open enemies and hidden enemies, as well as ideological enemies—the poisonous mists of "fragrant winds" constantly emitted by capitalist society. In this acute and complex class struggle, our platoon party branch firmly implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Using Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and other important works as teaching materials, we frequently and repeatedly conduct class struggle education among cadres and soldiers. We frequently and repeatedly use Chairman Mao's great teachings on "the People's Liberation Army must always be a fighting force," on preventing the attacks of "sugar-coated bullets" by the bourgeoisie, and on "ensuring that comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and ensuring that comrades continue to maintain a hardworking and self-reliant spirit," to arm the minds of all comrades in the platoon. The party branch, based on the new situation of domestic and international class struggle and the enemy situation on the border, in conjunction with the active thoughts of the platoon, uses the border outpost as a living classroom for class struggle, to conduct living education for everyone. Every year when new soldiers arrive at the platoon, we bring them to the scene of class struggle at "one street, two worlds," to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, to use the class analysis mirror to identify the ugly phenomena of capitalist society, and to strengthen the concept of class struggle.

Over the past decade, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's agent in the South, not only attempted to use our garrison town as a forward base for their capitalist restoration, personally running to the town to engage in many evil deeds, but also directly extended their black hands into our platoon, repeatedly poisoning us and peddling Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and "three surrenders and one destruction," attempting to undermine our fighting will. We saw through these scoundrels' plots, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to resolutely criticize and resist their counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts, and to ensure that class struggle is discussed in everything, every day, every month, and every year. This way, everyone's political awareness continuously improves, and they consciously use the perspective of class struggle to analyze everything, distinguish everything, and handle everything. In the border struggle against the enemy, they see clearly, stand firmly, withstand attacks, and are unyielding, always maintaining high revolutionary vigilance and vigorous fighting spirit. They have defeated countless attacks by enemies with and without guns, using Mao Zedong Thought to build the border outpost into a strong red fortress.

The great proletarian cultural revolution has presented our platoon with a new and stern test. In the early stages of the movement, some of our comrades had insufficient understanding of the counter-revolutionary nature of the number one capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi, and his clique, and of the reactionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line they promoted, leading to many active thoughts. We brought this problem to the study of Chairman Mao's great teachings: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise and recognize the problem in this way now, we will make a great mistake." We used Chairman Mao's instructions as a weapon to examine the weak links in the platoon's past political and ideological work. We felt that in the education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, we paid more attention to the enemies with guns in front of the outpost and less attention to the enemies without guns who infiltrated the party; we paid more attention to the struggle between the two military lines and less attention to the struggle between the two political lines within the party. We realized: only by firmly grasping the education on the struggle between the two lines within the party, making cadres and soldiers understand what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and what is Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, can we stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the cultural revolution and consciously criticize and resist the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, the party branch regards grasping the education on the struggle between the two lines and raising the awareness of this struggle as the key link in the construction of the platoon; keeping up with the new situation of the proletarian cultural revolution, using Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, this epoch-making Marxist-Leninist document, and a series of latest instructions as teaching materials, organizing cadres and soldiers to repeatedly and deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, especially the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party since the founding of the nation, studying Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat; and organizing cadres and soldiers to frequently go to the rural areas of the garrison, to experience the storms of the struggle between the two lines, to see the world of the struggle between the two lines, together with the revolutionary masses of the garrison, using the border outpost as the battlefield, using the living facts of border class struggle, to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and settling accounts with Liu Shaoqi and his clique's heinous crimes of betraying the party and the nation. This way, it effectively raised everyone's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, making everyone deeply realize that Liu Shaoqi and his clique are the running dogs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang within our party, the most dangerous and vicious enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under socialist conditions, the center of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is the issue of power, the issue of whether to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat or to overthrow it, the issue of whether the state power is in the hands of Marxist-Leninists or revisionists. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the only correct line, the line that ensures our country will never change color and will successfully transition from socialism to communism; while Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is an attempt to drag our country back to the old path of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, making the proletariat and laboring people become beasts of burden and suffer again. Everyone deeply feels: defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our sacred duty. We not only want to build the platoon into a strong fighting force for border struggle against the enemy but also into a strong fighting force for implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Each soldier should not only be a red sentinel for border struggle against the enemy but also a red sentinel for the struggle between the two lines, always standing guard and keeping watch for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fighting well.

Reviewing our platoon's practice of conducting education on the struggle between the two lines, we deeply feel that the awareness of the struggle between the two lines is the most fundamental awareness of revolutionary soldiers, and the education on the struggle between the two lines is the most fundamental political and ideological education for the platoon. Only by seriously studying the history of the struggle between the two lines and frequently, repeatedly, and deeply conducting education on the struggle between the two lines can we ensure that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply roots in all cadres and soldiers of the platoon, ensuring that the platoon always advances victoriously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We are determined to seriously carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further deepen the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, building the platoon into a fighting collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely following the great helmsman Chairman Mao from victory to victory!

    让毛主席的革命路线在连队深深扎根
    “红色前哨连”政治指导员　周永祥
    我们的伟大导师毛主席最近深刻地指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”
    反复学习毛主席这一最新指示，联系我们连队在毛主席革命路线指引下成长壮大的历史，深刻认识到：毛主席的最新指示无比英明，无比正确。只有反复地进行两条路线斗争教育，不断提高干部战士的两条路线斗争觉悟，才能保证连队永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。十几年来，我们连一直据守在“一条小街、两个世界”的边防对敌斗争最前哨，肩负着保卫边防、保卫无产阶级红色江山的任务。我们要对付的有公开的敌人和暗藏的敌人，还有思想上的敌人——资本主义社会每时每刻散发出来的“香风”毒雾。在这尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们连队党支部坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，以毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和其他重要著作为教材，经常反复地在干部战士中进行阶级斗争教育，经常反复地用毛主席关于“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队”，关于预防资产阶级“用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击”，以及“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”等伟大教导，武装全连同志的头脑。党支部根据国内外阶级斗争的新形势和边防的敌情，结合连队的活思想，利用边防前哨这个阶级斗争的活课堂，对大家进行活的教育。每年新战士一到连队，就把他们带到“一条小街、两个世界”的阶级斗争现场，学习毛主席的有关教导，用阶级分析的照妖镜，识别资本主义社会的丑恶现象，加强阶级斗争观念。
    十多年来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在中南的代理人，不但妄图把我们驻地小镇当作他们复辟资本主义的前哨据点，亲自跑到镇上搞了许多罪恶勾当，而且直接把黑手伸到了我们连队，多次到我们连队放毒，兜售刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“三降一灭”等黑货，妄图瓦解我们的战斗意志。我们识破了这些家伙的阴谋，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，坚决批判、抵制了他们的反革命修正主义思想，坚持做到阶级斗争事事讲，天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，使大家的政治觉悟不断提高，自觉地用阶级斗争观点分析一切，辨别一切，处理一切，在边防对敌斗争中看得清，站得稳，顶得住，过得硬，始终保持高度的革命警惕和旺盛的战斗意志，战胜了拿枪的敌人和不拿枪的敌人的无数次进攻，用毛泽东思想把边防前哨筑成了坚强的红色堡垒。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，使我们连队面临崭新的严峻考验。在运动初期，我们有些同志对党内头号走资派刘少奇和他的同伙的反革命面目、对他们推行的资产阶级反动路线的反动实质认识不足，产生不少活思想。我们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”我们用毛主席的指示作为武器，检查了连队过去政治思想工作中的薄弱环节。我们感到，过去在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育中，注意哨前拿枪的敌人多，注意背后钻进党内的不拿枪的敌人少；注意两条军事路线斗争多，注意党内两条政治路线斗争少。我们认识到：只有狠抓党内两条路线斗争教育，使干部战士懂得什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，才能在文化大革命中坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，自觉地批判和抵制资产阶级反动路线。因此，党支部把抓两条路线斗争教育，提高两条路线斗争觉悟，当作连队建设的中心环节；紧跟无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告这篇具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义伟大文献和一系列最新指示为教材，组织干部战士反复地、深入地学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，特别是建国以来党内两条路线斗争的历史，学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策；并且组织干部战士经常到驻地农村中去，经两条路线斗争的风雨，见两条路线斗争的世面，同驻地革命群众一起，以边防前哨为战场，用边防阶级斗争活生生的事实，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行。这样做的结果，有效地提高了大家的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，使大家深刻认识到，刘少奇及其同伙是钻进我们党内的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，是无产阶级专政最危险最凶恶的敌人。在社会主义条件下，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争的中心，是政权问题，是巩固无产阶级专政还是颠覆无产阶级专政的问题，是国家政权掌握在马克思列宁主义者手里还是修正主义者手里的问题。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是唯一正确的路线，是保证我国永不变色，胜利地从社会主义过渡到共产主义的路线；而刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，则是妄图把我国拉回到半封建、半殖民地的老路，让我们无产阶级和劳动人民重新当牛马、再吃二遍苦的“断命线”。大家都深深感到：捍卫毛主席革命路线是我们的神圣职责。我们不但要把连队建设成为边防对敌斗争的坚强战斗队，而且要成为执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的坚强战斗队。每个战士既要当边防对敌斗争的红哨兵，更要当两条路线斗争的红哨兵，时刻为毛主席革命路线站好岗，放好哨，打好仗。
    回顾我们连队进行两条路线斗争教育的实践，我们深深体会到，两条路线斗争觉悟是革命战士最根本的觉悟，两条路线斗争教育是连队最根本的政治思想教育。只有认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，经常地、反复地、深入地进行两条路线斗争教育，让毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在全连干部战士中深深扎根，才能保证连队永远沿着毛主席革命路线胜利前进。我们决心认真贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，进一步深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，把连队建设成为无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗集体，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席从胜利走向胜利！
