We Hate the Exploitation System to the Death

—Active Participants in the Study and Application of Mao Zedong Thought Among Minority Officers and Soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region Criticize Liu Shaoqi's Reactionary Fallacy of "Exploitation Has Merit"

How to view exploitation—whether to expose it or cover it up, whether to oppose it or support it—has always been a dividing line between revolution and counterrevolution, a touchstone for distinguishing Marxism-Leninism from revisionism. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "The essence of Marxism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' For thousands of years, it has always been said: 'Oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, rebellion is not justified.' Since the advent of Marxism, this old case has been overturned. This is a great merit. This truth is derived from the struggles of the proletariat, and Marx drew the conclusion. Based on this truth, people then rebel, fight, and build socialism." On the eve of national liberation, our great leader Chairman Mao delivered a report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposing the great program of transitioning from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, establishing and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and building socialism. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi did everything he could to suppress the struggles of the working people against the exploiting classes, shouting loudly in praise of the capitalist system, and vigorously peddling the counterrevolutionary fallacy of "exploitation is justified" and "exploitation has merit." Recently, active participants in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought among minority officers and soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region held a symposium, using their own personal experiences of blood and tears, to vehemently criticize the great traitor Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of "exploitation has merit."

"The Theory of 'Exploitation Has Merit' Is a Theory of Cannibalism"

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, shamelessly said: "Exploitation is not only not a crime, but it has merit. The more widespread the exploitation, the more workers are exploited, the greater the merit." He also blabbered: "This merit is eternal!"

Is there really such a thing as exploitation that is not a crime but has merit in the world? No! All exploitation is evil and reactionary. As Marx said: "Capital comes into the world dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt." So-called exploitation is the plundering of the labor fruits of the working people through the private ownership of the means of production. Exploitation is eating human flesh and drinking human blood! Exploitation is murder! The exploitation system is a banquet of human flesh! A Simi soldier from the Sixth Platoon of a certain unit, Alusuwu, whose family has been in servitude for three generations, said: "The bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, we children understand best! Whether exploitation is a crime or has merit, we children understand best! Looking back at the bloody history of the Simi people, opening the account of sufferings of all our class brothers in the platoon, I want to shout angrily: Exploitation is a crime, a crime deserving a thousand deaths! In our platoon of over a hundred people, more than thirty have relatives who were killed by slave owners; more than sixty have been slaves themselves, suffered severe beatings from slave owners, and still bear the scars of hatred; more than ten have families destroyed, and they don't even know their own surname or who their parents are. My grandparents were slaves, my parents were slaves, they fed the slave owners with their blood and sweat, and died of exhaustion on Longtou Mountain. When my parents died, I was only three years old. The heartless slave owners did not spare me, chaining me up and throwing me into the pigpen. During the day, I would steal some pig food to eat when hungry, and at night, I would huddle next to the pigs to keep warm. Day after day, I spent thirteen springs and autumns in this hell on earth, my body covered in wounds, my heart full of hatred! Longtou Mountain is high, piled with the bones of slaves; Jinsha River is long, flowing with the tears of slaves; the silver of the slave owners is forged with the blood of slaves. Why? It's all because of exploitation, because of the exploitation system! The great traitor Liu Shaoqi talks about 'exploitation has merit,' 'merit' where? You are a vicious dog raised by the slave owners, and the fallacy you peddle is a pure theory of cannibalism!"

Where is the "merit"? In his black report, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi said that it is because the capitalists' exploitation "increased social wealth." He also bluntly said that hiring people and opening oil mills "is not called exploitation" because it "increased social wealth." Everyone gave a stern refutation one by one. They said: Chairman Mao taught us, "Social wealth is created by workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals." Landlords and capitalists, relying on the means of production they own, exploit the working people and plunder the wealth created by the working people for themselves. They do not labor with their four limbs and do not understand the five grains, how can they create any wealth! According to the logic of this bloodsucker Liu Shaoqi, landlords and capitalists plundering the wealth created by the working people "is not called exploitation." I ask: From the past to the present, from the slave owners to the capitalists, from the bosses of Wall Street in the United States to the Four Big Families in China, aren't they all supposed to remove the hats of exploiters and not be considered exploitation? Isn't this equivalent to saying that there is no exploitation in the world? If there is no exploitation in the world, then is there no class, no class struggle? What revolution is there to make? Liu Shaoqi shamelessly defends exploitation and the exploiting classes, exposing his ugly traitor's face, what else can it prove?

A platoon leader from a certain unit, a Tibetan soldier named Zhuodu, who had been a serf for fifteen years, angrily tore open his clothes, pointing to the wolf bite marks on his legs and a wound the size of a bowl, said: "This is a wolf bite, this is a knife cut, all done by the headman himself. The crow is black, but not as black as the heart of the slave owner; the galangal is bitter, but not as bitter as the bitterness of the slaves a thousand times over. My ancestors have been working for the slave owners, my parents were starved to death by the headman. I was less than two feet tall when I started holding the whip. I was young and weak, and if I did not please the headman, the headman would let the wolf dogs bite me. In that world, the sky belonged to the headman, the earth belonged to the headman, our lives were cheaper than a dog's. Chopping feet, skinning, pulling tendons, gouging eyes, cutting tongues, many of our class brothers were killed like this. If you visit the homes of the Tibetan working people, there is no family without a history of suffering, no one without a blood debt of hatred! We have tasted the bitterness of exploitation, we are full of hatred for the exploiting classes! The great traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates 'exploitation is justified,' 'exploitation has merit,' trying to make us return to that dark hell on earth, to make us be slaves again, generation after generation, we will never agree!"

"The Theory of 'Exploitation Has Merit' Is a Theory of Justifying the Exploiting Classes"

"Prohibiting exploitation is dogmatism." This is Liu Shaoqi's poisoned arrow shot at the revolutionary people to promote his counterrevolutionary theory of "exploitation has merit." Everyone pointed out unanimously that Liu Shaoqi wants to suppress people with this, but it is in vain, just like all the reactionary revisionists, always using the pretext of opposing "dogmatism" to attack Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism has always believed that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful. Communists fight to eliminate the exploitation system. Only landlords and capitalists advocate "exploitation is glorious" and "exploitation has merit." Liu Shaoqi wears the same pants and sings the same tune as the landlords and capitalists, is the agent of the Kuomintang in our Party, and is the propagandist and defender of counterrevolutionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The great traitor Liu Shaoqi also said, "Exploitation saves people," "It is better to have someone exploit than to have no one exploit," "We are more comfortable if we can be exploited, otherwise we feel pain." This is the great traitor, the great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's self-exposure of his ugly soul, and also a great insult to us revolutionary people! Everyone indignantly pointed out: "Exploitation saves whom? It saves the capitalists! Who welcomes exploitation? It is the vampires! It is the parasites! Under the oppression of the evil exploitation system, the whole family of six were sold as slaves. A Simi soldier, Walaha, with his own family history of blood and tears, vehemently criticized the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. He said: "My father was beaten to death by the slave owner, my mother was sold and suffered endless torment, died with grievances, five brothers were sold east and west, now none can be found. The evil exploitation system has harmed us greatly, this is murder! This is cannibalism! Liu Shaoqi reverses black and white, recognizes the enemy as a father, and insists that exploitation is 'saving people,' making us grateful to the slave owners and capitalists, this is extremely absurd, extremely reactionary! His theory of 'exploitation saves people' is the same tune as the exploiters of the past. In the old society, when the slave owners whipped us slaves, they gnashed their teeth and said, 'You poor bones, if it weren't for me, the headman, you would have been thrown into the wolf pit, if it weren't for me, the headman, giving you tsamba to eat, you would have drunk the northwest wind on Longtou Mountain in the morning.' Liu Shaoqi blows the same horn and sings the same tune as the slave owners, this shows that they are black melons from the same poisonous vine." A Tibetan soldier, Achun, who suffered greatly in the old society, indignantly said: "History cannot be reversed, black and white cannot be mixed up. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have always taught us, making us deeply understand: It is not the landlords who feed the peasants, but the peasants who feed the landlords; it is not the capitalists who feed the workers, but the workers who feed the capitalists; it is not the slave owners who feed the slaves, but the slaves who feed the slave owners!"

A Korean ethnic deputy platoon leader, Jin Hanjun, from a certain company, used his own family history of suffering to explain that the more one is exploited, the poorer one becomes, the deeper the pain of exploitation, and angrily refuted Liu Shaoqi's fallacy of "it is better to have someone exploit than to have no one exploit." He said: "Liu Shaoqi's black words, a landlord's tone, a complete servant's tune. My ancestors have been laboring, but the more they labor, the heavier the worries, the more debts, and there is no way to live, so my father took us to the Northeast to be coal miners. But the crows in the world are all black, the hearts of the bosses are equally cruel, there is no place in the world for us poor people to live, forcing our family of ten to sell, die, and scatter. The iron hooves of imperialism, the chains of landlord tyrants, the whips of capitalists, have made my family, have made us Korean ethnic laboring people suffer so much hardship and torment! The water of the Yalu River flows day and night, it cannot wash away our hatred and resentment for the exploiting classes! Liu Shaoqi's fallacy of 'it is better to have someone exploit than to have no one exploit' is completely the philosophy of a traitor, the tone of landlords and capitalists."

Everyone pointed out: Birds of a feather flock together, people of the same ilk gather. Why does Liu Shaoqi love capitalism so much? Why does he hate socialism so much? Why does he beautify the vampires so much? Why does he slander the laboring people so viciously? It is because we have overthrown the exploitation system, hit the landlord bourgeoisie, and it hurts the heart of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi loves capitalism, thinks of capitalism, and does capitalism. He is the general agent of the landlord bourgeoisie who has infiltrated our Party, and he has played the role that the bourgeoisie wants to play but cannot. These minority officers and soldiers who have personally suffered the bloody oppression of the slave owners and capitalists, who have deep hatred, are all filled with indignation, with strong class feelings, saying: "Wolves eat sheep, slave owners exploit slaves, the exploitation system is murder! We minorities are liberated by Chairman Mao. Since the light of Chairman Mao shone upon the various minority areas, a red sun that never sets has risen there, shattering the thousand-year chains on our bodies, eliminating the ten-thousand-year hatred in our hearts, and the history that has been reversed by the exploiting classes has been reversed back to its original form. But the great traitor Liu Shaoqi is doing everything he can to clear the way for the restoration of capitalism, desperately trying to reverse the case of the exploiting classes. This is absolutely impossible! The capitalist system must be eliminated, the exploiting classes must be overthrown! This is an iron case, it cannot be reversed! It will never be reversed!"

Comrade Lin Biao said: "If you do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." This is an unshakable truth. Everyone, with countless facts, explained how they understood the truth of revolution under the nurturing of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, strengthened their will to fight, recognized the reactionary nature of the exploitation system, and saw more clearly and hated more deeply the venomous heart of Liu Shaoqi who vigorously advocates the fallacy of "exploitation has merit."

Criticize the Fallacy of "Exploitation Has Merit," Overthrow the Traitor Liu Shaoqi

If you do not remember the past bitterness, how can you know the present sweetness! Under the exploitation system, the whole family starved to death, and at the age of six, became a slave. A Tibetan soldier, Niwo, said: "No matter how high the snow-capped mountains are, they have a peak; no matter how long the rivers are, they have a source. The suffering of the Tibetan people also has a root. This root is exploitation, the exploitation system. Whoever opposes exploitation, eliminates exploitation, we children will be close to them; whoever advocates exploitation, insists on exploitation, they are against the revolution, we children will fight them to the death!" A Zhuang soldier, Lanshizhong, who was reduced to ruin in the old society, deeply felt: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a great revolution to prevent the restoration of the capitalist exploitation system and to completely eliminate the exploitation system. Liu Shaoqi is the backer of the big headmen of our Tibetan people, the slave owners of the Simi people, the princes of the Mongolian people, and the tyrants of the Korean and Zhuang people. To prevent these ghosts from exploiting and oppressing us again, we must resolutely overthrow the great traitor, great spy, and great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. To prevent the restoration of the exploitation system, we must criticize and overthrow Liu Shaoqi and his fallacy of 'exploitation has merit'!"

Forgetting the past means betrayal. A deputy company commander of a certain unit, a Mongolian named Bai Junting, said: "The evil exploitation system devoured our whole family, my father and mother died of exhaustion in the prince's mansion, my sister was sold to the prince and tortured to death, I was a shepherd in the prince's mansion at the age of eight. What is exploitation, we understand best!" He indignantly recalled a bitter incident: "One winter, snow was falling heavily, the ground was frozen, the prince still forced me to drive the sheep to the valley to find grass. I was hungry, wearing a broken sack, barefoot, cold and hungry, driving and driving, when I could no longer bear it, I found a place to hide from the snow and warm up. Who would have thought that misfortune never comes alone, a wolf carried off a lamb. This time, I had committed a great crime. As soon as I returned to the prince's mansion, I was beaten until my skin was torn. Finally, they forced me to find the lamb, and if I didn't find it, they would feed me to the wolves. The sky was vast, the earth was vast, I crawled and searched for a day and night, finally found the two lamb legs left in the wolf's mouth, and brought them back. As a result, the prince beat me severely, deducted my salary for a year, and said I was small and weak, my salary could not cover the food. Later, I worked for six more years for free, and still had not paid off this debt to the underworld. Until Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army, I was rescued from this den of wolves. Look! The exploitation system is so unreasonable, so evil, so ruthless. The rich man's paradise is built on the bones of the poor. At that time, I didn't understand anything else, I only knew that I wanted to take revenge, to avenge, and I didn't want to be exploited anymore. Later, I joined the People's Liberation Army, and under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, I became a Communist Party member, a soldier of the proletariat!"

Trees have roots, water has a source. Why were the poor so miserable in the past, and why were the exploiting classes so rich? Everyone pointed out unanimously: This is because there are classes, there is exploitation, there is the exploitation system. This is the root cause of the suffering of our various nationalities. They said with deep proletarian feelings: "We hate the exploitation system the most, we love socialism the most, we are loyal to Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao is the great savior of our various nationalities, the red sun in our hearts. It is because of Chairman Mao that our various nationalities have been completely liberated." They expressed: Always be loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao to make revolution for life, remember the class bitterness, do not forget the blood debt, resolutely eliminate all human-eating exploitation systems. Although Liu Shaoqi, this pile of filth unworthy of human dignity, desperately beautifies the capitalist exploitation system and spreads the evil wind of "exploitation has merit," the revolutionary torrent will eventually drown Liu Shaoqi and his gang of running dogs who have sold themselves to the bourgeoisie!

    我们对剥削制度有不共戴天的仇恨
    ——成都部队部分少数民族干部战士活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子痛斥刘少奇“剥削有功”的反动谬论
     对待剥削采取什么态度，是揭露它还是掩盖它？是反对它还是维护它？这从来就是革命和反革命的一个分水岭，是区分马克思列宁主义和修正主义的一块试金石。毛主席早就教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。这是一个大功劳。这个道理是无产阶级从斗争中得来的，而马克思作了结论。根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”全国解放前夕，伟大领袖毛主席做了《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，提出了从新民主主义革命转变为社会主义革命、建立和巩固无产阶级专政、建设社会主义的伟大纲领。但是，大叛徒刘少奇却千方百计地压制劳动人民对剥削阶级的斗争，声嘶力竭地为资本主义制度唱赞歌，极力兜售“剥削有理”、“剥削有功”的反革命谬论。最近，成都部队部分少数民族干部战士活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子举行座谈，以自己亲身经历的血泪史，痛斥了大叛徒刘少奇“剥削有功”的反动谬论。
      “剥削有功”论是“吃人哲学”
    党内最大的走资派刘少奇十分无耻地说：“剥削不只是没罪，剥削是有功的，剥削范围越广，剥削工人愈多，功劳愈大。”他还胡说：“这个功绩是永垂不朽的”！
    世界上果真有什么不仅无罪而且有功的剥削么？否！一切剥削都是罪恶的，反动的。正如马克思所说：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”所谓剥削，就是依靠生产资料的私有制，掠夺劳动人民的劳动成果。剥削就是吃人肉，喝人血！剥削就是杀人！剥削制度就是摆的人肉“宴席”！来自凉山的某部六连彝族战士、三代娃子出身的阿苏武果同志说：“旧社会的苦和新社会的甜，我们娃子最懂得！剥削是有功还是有罪，我们娃子最明白！回想我们彝族人民的血泪史，打开我们全连阶级兄弟的苦情账，我要愤怒高呼：剥削有罪，罪该万死！我们全连百把人，其中有三十多人亲属被奴隶主杀掉；有六十多人本人当过娃子，受过奴隶主严刑毒打，至今还留有仇恨伤疤；有十多人家破人亡，自己姓什么，父母是谁，至今都不知道。我爷爷奶奶是娃子，我爸爸妈妈还是娃子，他们用血汗喂肥了奴隶主，使出了最后一口气，活活累死在龙头山上。爸爸妈妈死的时候，我才三岁，狠心的奴隶主也不放过，把我拴起链子丢进猪栏。我白天饿了就偷点猪食吃，夜晚冷了就贴紧猪儿睡，朝朝暮暮，就这样在人间地狱里度过了十三个春秋，身上遍伤痕，心中满仇恨！龙头山高，是娃子的尸骨堆成的；金沙水长，是娃子的眼泪流成的；奴隶主的银子，是娃子的鲜血铸成的。这是为什么？就是因为有剥削，因为有剥削制度！大叛徒刘少奇说什么‘剥削有功’，‘功’在那里？你是奴隶主豢养的一条恶狗，你贩卖的这个谬论是地地道道的‘吃人哲学’！”
      “功”在那里？大叛徒刘少奇在他的黑报告中说，是因为资本家的剥削“增加了社会财富”。他还露骨地说什么雇人、开油坊可以“不叫剥削”，也是因为“增加了社会财富”。大家也一一给予严厉的驳斥。他们说：毛主席教导我们，“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。”地主资本家是靠他们占有的生产资料，剥削劳动人民，掠夺劳动人民创造的财富为己有。他们四体不勤，五谷不分，哪能创造什么财富！按照刘少奇这个吸血鬼的逻辑，地主资本家掠夺劳动人民创造的财富“不叫剥削”，试问：上下五千年，纵横十万里，从奴隶主到资本家，从美帝的华尔街老板到中国的四大家族，岂不是都可以不算剥削而应该摘除剥削者的帽子了吗？岂不是等于说世界上压根儿就不存在什么剥削了吗？！世界上既没有剥削，那还有什么阶级、阶级斗争？还闹什么革命呢？刘少奇这样无耻地为剥削辩护，为剥削阶级辩护，除了说明他是一个老牌的反革命，暴露他那丑恶的叛徒嘴脸之外，还能说明什么呢！
    当了十五年农奴的某部排长藏族战士热多，愤恨地撕开自己的衣裳，数着腿上的狼牙印，指着那碗口大的伤疤说：“这是狼狗咬的，这是刀砍的，都是头人亲自下手干的。乌鸦黑，黑不过奴隶主的心；黄连苦，娃子比黄连苦万分。我家祖祖辈辈给农奴主干活，爸爸妈妈活活地叫头人给饿死了。我身高不到两尺就拿起羊鞭子了，人幼力气小，稍不如头人的意，头人就放狼狗咬。那世道，天是头人的天，地是头人的地，我们娃子的命贱得不如一条狗，剁足，剥皮，抽筋，剜眼睛，割舌头，我们好多阶级弟兄就这样活活地被害死了。到我们藏族劳动人民家里访一访，那家没有苦难史，那个没有血泪仇！我们尝够了剥削的苦，我们充满了对剥削阶级的恨！大叛徒刘少奇鼓吹什么‘剥削有理’、‘剥削有功’，妄想叫我们再回到那暗无天日的人间地狱里去，叫我们再当第二次娃子，世世代代当奴隶，我们坚决不答应！”
      “剥削有功”论是为剥削阶级翻案
      “不准剥削是教条主义。”这是刘少奇为了推销他的反革命“剥削有功”论，射向革命人民的一支毒箭。大家一致指出，刘少奇妄想以此压人，那是心劳日拙，枉费心机，他和一切反革命修正主义分子一样，总是借口反对“教条主义”来攻击马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义从来就认为劳动光荣，剥削可耻。共产党人就是为了消灭剥削制度而奋斗的。只有地主资本家，才宣扬“剥削光荣”、“剥削有功”。刘少奇与地主资本家穿的是一条裤子，唱的是一个调子，是国民党在我们党内的代理人，是为复辟资本主义而大造反革命舆论的吹鼓手和辩护士。
    大叛徒刘少奇还说什么“剥削是救人”，“有人剥削比没有人剥削好”，“能剥削我们倒舒服些，否则我们倒觉得痛苦”。这是大叛徒、大工贼刘少奇的丑恶灵魂的自我暴露，也是对我们革命人民的莫大污蔑！大家愤慨地指出：“剥削救人”，救的什么人？救的是资本家！“欢迎剥削”，谁欢迎？是吸血鬼！是寄生虫！在万恶的剥削制度压榨下，全家六口人都被卖出当娃子的彝族战士瓦尔哈打，以自己血泪斑斑的家史，痛斥大叛徒刘少奇。他说：“我爸爸被奴隶主活活地打死了，妈妈被卖了，受尽折磨，含冤死去，五个弟兄卖在东，卖在西，如今一个也找不到。万恶的剥削制度，把我们害苦了，这是杀人！是吃人！刘少奇颠倒黑白，认贼作父，硬说剥削是‘救人’，要我们向奴隶主、资本家去感恩戴德，真是混账之极，反动透顶！他的‘剥削救人’论和历来的剥削鬼是同一腔调。过去奴隶主舞着皮鞭毒打我们娃子的时候，就咬牙切齿地说什么：‘穷骨头，不是我头人养活你，你早就丢到野狼坑里了，不是我头人给你糌粑吃，你早上龙头山喝西北风了。’刘少奇跟奴隶主吹的一个法螺，唱的一个调调，这正好说明他们是一根毒藤上的黑瓜。”在旧社会苦大仇深的藏族战士阿村愤慨地说：“历史不容颠倒，黑白不容混淆。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想历来教导我们，使我们深深懂得：不是地主养活农民，而是农民养活了地主；不是资本家养活工人，而是工人养活了资本家；不是奴隶主养活娃子，而是娃子养活了奴隶主！”
    某连朝鲜族副指导员金汉俊同志以他自己的苦难家史，说明越受剥削越穷，越受剥削痛苦越深，怒斥刘少奇的“有人剥削比没有人剥削好”的谬论。他说：“刘少奇这些黑话，一副地主腔，十足奴才调。我祖祖辈辈扛活，可是越扛愁越重，越扛债越多，没法活了，爸爸才带着我们下关东，当窑化子。但天下老鸦一般黑，财主心肠同样狠，天下之大竟无我们穷人一块容身之地，逼得我们全家十口人卖的卖，死的死，散的散。帝国主义的铁蹄，地主恶霸的锁链，资本家的皮鞭，使我全家，使我们朝鲜族劳动人民受了多少苦难和煎熬啊！鸭绿江水日夜流，流不尽我们对剥削阶级的恨和仇！刘少奇的所谓‘有人剥削比没有人剥削好’的谬论，完全是叛徒的哲学，地主资本家的腔调。”
    大家指出：物以类聚，人以群分。刘少奇为什么对资本主义这么亲？为什么对社会主义这么恨？为什么百般美化吸血鬼？为什么恶毒诽谤劳动人民？就是因为我们推翻了剥削制度，打在地主资产阶级的身上，痛在大叛徒刘少奇的心上。刘少奇爱的是资本主义，想的是资本主义，干的还是资本主义。他是地主资产阶级钻进我们党内的总代理人，他起了资产阶级想起而起不到的作用。这些亲身受过农奴主、资本家血腥压榨，苦大仇深的少数民族干部战士，个个义愤填膺，怀着强烈的阶级感情说：“狼是吃羊的，奴隶主是剥削娃子的，剥削制度是杀人的！我们各少数民族是毛主席解放的。自从毛主席的光辉照到各个少数民族地区，我们那里才升起了不落的红太阳，砸碎了我们身上的千年锁，消除了我们心头的万年恨，被剥削阶级颠倒了的历史，才按照历史本来面貌颠倒了过来。可是，大叛徒刘少奇却千方百计地为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，拚命为剥削阶级翻案。这一万个办不到！资本主义制度必须消灭，剥削阶级必须打倒！这是铁案，翻不了！永远翻不了！”
    林副主席说：“不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”这是颠扑不破的真理。大家以无数事实，说明他们怎样在战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育下，懂得了革命的道理，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，增强了斗争意志，认清了剥削制度的反动本质，对刘少奇极力宣扬“剥削有功”的蛇蝎之心，就看得更清楚，恨得更深切！
  批臭“剥削有功”论，打倒叛徒刘少奇
    不知昔日苦，哪知今日甜！在剥削制度下全家活活饿死、六岁就当娃子的藏族战士尼洼说：“雪山再高也有顶，江河再长也有源，藏族人民的苦难也有根。这个根就是剥削，就是剥削制度。谁反对剥削，消灭剥削，我们娃子就和他亲；谁要宣扬剥削，坚持剥削，谁就是反对革命，我们娃子就坚决和他拚！”在万恶的旧社会被弄得家破人亡的壮族战士兰仕忠同志深有感受地说：“我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这次无产阶级文化大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续，是为了防止资本主义剥削制度复辟，为了彻底消灭剥削制度的一场大革命。刘少奇就是我们藏族大头人、彝族奴隶主、蒙族王爷、朝鲜族和壮族的恶霸老财的总后台。要避免这些恶鬼重新剥削压迫我们，就要坚决打倒大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇。要防止剥削制度复辟，就要把刘少奇连同他的‘剥削有功’论批倒批臭！”
    忘记过去，就意味着背叛。某部副营长蒙古族的白俊廷同志说：“万恶的剥削制度吞噬了我们全家，父亲母亲累死在王爷府，姐姐卖给王爷被活活折磨死了，我八岁就在王爷府当牧童。什么叫剥削，我们最懂得！”他愤慨地回忆一桩辛酸往事说：“一年冬天，大雪纷飞，天寒地冻，王爷还逼迫我赶着羊群去山凹找草。我饿着肚子披了一件破麻袋，光着脚丫，又冷又饿，赶呀赶呀，实在受不了时，找了人家躲一阵雪，取了取暖。谁知祸不单行，野狼叼走了一只小羊羔。这下可闯下了弥天大祸。我一回王爷府，就被打得皮开肉绽。最后他们还逼着我去找小羊，不见羊羔就要把我喂野狼。天茫茫，地茫茫，我连滚带爬，找了一昼夜，终于找到狼嘴里剩下的两只小羊腿，提了回来。结果，王爷把我毒打了一顿，扣了我一年工资，还说我人小力气小，工钱抵不了饭钱。以后，我又白白干了六年活，还没偿清这笔阎王债。直到毛主席派来了解放军，才把我从这个虎狼窝里救出来。看！剥削制度就是这样不讲理，就是这样罪恶，就是这样吃人不吐骨头。富人的天堂就是建筑在我们穷人白骨堆上的。当时，我别的也不懂，只晓得要报仇，要雪恨，不愿再受剥削。后来，我参加了人民解放军，在伟大的毛泽东思想抚育下，才成为一个共产党员，一个无产阶级战士！”
    树有根，水有源。过去穷人为什么这般苦，剥削阶级为什么那般富？大家一致指出：这是因为有阶级，有剥削，有剥削制度。这是造成我们各族人民苦难的根源。他们以深厚的无产阶级感情说：“我们对剥削制度最恨最恨，对社会主义最爱最爱，对毛主席最忠最忠。毛主席是我们各族人民的大救星，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。有了毛主席才有我们各族人民的彻底解放。”他们表示：永远忠于毛主席，一辈子跟着毛主席干革命，牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，坚决消灭一切人吃人的剥削制度。尽管刘少奇这个不齿于人类的狗屎堆，拚命美化资本主义剥削制度，大刮“剥削有功”的妖风，但是，革命的洪流终究把刘少奇一伙卖身投靠资产阶级的叭儿狗们淹没了！
