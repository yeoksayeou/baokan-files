Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it," and the re-publication of Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee have greatly inspired the workers of the Second Converter Workshop of Shanggang Sanchang. This has added boundless strength to us, sparking a new wave of revolution and production.

Recently, as we have delved into studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives, our workshop's various teams have extensively discussed the significant fluctuations in production over August, September, and October. From this, we have drawn valuable lessons.

In August, the workshop intensified the struggle against the enemy, and production levels surged, exceeding the historical high by over 1,000 tons. In September, production not only did not rise but suddenly dropped. By October, steel production had surged again, increasing by 2,600 tons compared to August. The high-low-high changes over three months signify what? A few workers from our workshop formed an investigation team to look into this issue. Through the investigation, everyone unanimously agreed that to ensure production, we must first intensify class struggle. By intensifying class struggle, we can fully unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, and production will rise; if we relax class struggle, we will lose direction, and production will decline.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, the workshop revolutionary committee took class struggle as the key, mobilized the masses, and extensively exposed the class struggle. By July and August, a high tide of struggle against the enemy had formed, rooting out a handful of class enemies who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. We held over 100 struggle meetings, large and small. The workshop's criticism columns were published one after another, and 35 types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held. The entire workshop was a battlefield of criticism against the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi.

The broad masses of workers directed the boundless enthusiasm ignited in the struggle against the enemy into production, driving the leapfrog development of production. According to the usual pattern, it is already difficult to maintain stable production in August, the high-temperature season. However, the workers said, "Chairman Mao is backing us up, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! No matter how high the temperature, it cannot surpass the boundless enthusiasm of steel workers; no matter how red the molten steel, it cannot surpass our limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao. We must set records and achieve high yields!" The workers' heroic struggle resulted in the workshop's daily steel output in August increasing by over 85% compared to previous months, and the monthly steel output exceeded the highest level in December 1966 by over 1,000 tons.

When summarizing August's production, everyone said, "August's production was good because we closely followed Chairman Mao's latest directives, and because we firmly grasped the key of class struggle!"

In this favorable situation, some comrades in the workshop revolutionary committee developed a sense of complacency and neglect. Some thought that the work of purging class ranks was "almost done," and they could relax; others wrongly believed that "production is a hard task, while purging class ranks is a soft task," proposing the erroneous idea of "you handle the revolution, and I'll manage production." As a result, leadership efforts were concentrated on production, relaxing the struggle against the enemy and revolutionary criticism.

Once the struggle against the enemy was relaxed, class enemies would attack. Some class enemies who had been exposed used "sugar-coated bullets" to attack the revolutionary masses; some hidden enemies engaged in sabotage during production. They spread rumors, stirred up trouble, and incited anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism among the workers. In this situation, the revolutionary committee comrades ran from one workshop to another, busy handling production issues. The broad revolutionary masses saw class enemies causing trouble and sabotage behind the scenes, production not improving, and were very anxious. Because class struggle was relaxed, by the end of the month, steel output was 1,000 tons less than in August.

However, in September, the third shift, by firmly grasping class struggle, holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing the masses, and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, not only did steel output not decline but also achieved outstanding results in variety, quality, cost, and consumption. The third shift workers said well: "No matter how busy, class struggle must not be forgotten. Revolution is the driving force for production development. Only by firmly grasping the revolution can production be rapidly promoted."

Raising the banner and grasping the key, revolution and production flourish

The central newspapers and journals' National Day editorials and the fourth issue of the Red Flag magazine conveyed Chairman Mao's latest battle orders. The workshop revolutionary committee, in light of September's work, seriously studied the editorials, further armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and conducted investigations and research on the front lines of the struggle. They faced many shocking class struggle facts, summarized experiences and lessons, and thus raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Many comrades deeply felt that in the previous period, we relaxed the struggle against the enemy, did not criticize or struggle against class enemies, resulting in them causing trouble everywhere, disrupting the revolution and production. This is a serious lesson! They said, the experience of the third shift tells us that only by remembering Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," always remembering class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and never forgetting to "raise the banner and grasp the key"—highly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasping the key of class struggle, and using the key to lead steel production—can we promote the continuous development of production. If we only focus on production without grasping the revolution, not only will production not be good, but we will also fall into the revisionist path of "production first" advocated by Liu Shaoqi.

With improved ideological understanding, work was carried out in the correct direction. Each team, using the class enemies exposed by the workshop and the factory as living examples, linked them to the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and launched a revolutionary criticism. Through revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers were greatly heightened, quickly changing the situation where production could not leap forward. In October, the workshop's steel output broke the high production level of August. Since November, new records have been set one after another, and the monthly steel output has leaped to a new level.

    从一个车间生产的升降看两条路线斗争和生产的关系
    ——调查报告
  　上钢三厂第二转炉车间工人调查小组
    毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示的发表，毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告的重新发表，极大地鼓舞了我们上钢三厂第二转炉车间的工人群众，使我们增添了无穷的力量，掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
    最近，我们车间各班组在深入学习和落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，结合今年八、九、十三个月车间的生产显著升降的情况，展开了广泛的讨论，从中吸取到很大的教益。
    今年八月，车间狠抓了对敌斗争，生产水平大幅度上升，钢产量超过了历史最高水平一千吨。九月份，生产不仅没有上去，反而突然下降。到了十月，钢产量又大幅度上升，比八月增产二千六百吨。三个月内，高——低——高的变化，说明了什么？我们车间几个工人组成了一个调查小组，对这个问题进行了调查。通过调查，大家一致认为，要抓好生产，首先要抓好阶级斗争。抓了阶级斗争，就能充分发挥工人群众的革命积极性，生产就能上去；放松阶级斗争，就会迷失方向，生产就要下降。
    以“纲”带钢，革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾
    在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，车间革委会以阶级斗争为纲，放手发动群众，大揭阶级斗争盖子，到今年七、八月就开始形成了对敌斗争的高潮，揪出了混进革命队伍内的一小撮阶级敌人。我们召开了大小批斗会一百多次。车间的大批判专栏一期接一期，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班办了三十五期。全车间处处是批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的战场。
    广大工人群众把在对敌斗争中激发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上，推动了生产的飞跃发展。按照常规，在八月份这个高温季节里，钢产量能够保持稳产就不容易了。可是工人们却说：“毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！气温再高，高不过我们钢铁工人的冲天干劲；钢水再红，红不过我们对毛主席无限忠诚的赤胆忠心，我们一定要创纪录，夺高产！”工人们英勇奋战的结果，车间八月份钢的日产水平比以往猛增百分之八十五以上，全月钢产量比一九六六年十二月份的最高水平超过了一千吨。
    大家在总结八月份生产的时候都说，八月份生产好，好就好在对毛主席最新指示跟得紧上，好就好在对阶级斗争这个“纲”抓得狠上！
    忘了阶级斗争这条“纲”，势必丢掉钢
    在一派大好形势下，车间革委会的一些同志却滋长了轻敌麻痹思想。有的同志认为，清理阶级队伍工作已经“差不多”了，可以松口气了；还有的同志错误地认为，“生产是硬任务，清理阶级队伍是软任务”，提出了“你抓革命，生产我来管”的错误意见。结果，由于领导力量都集中在搞生产上，放松了对敌斗争，放松了革命大批判。
    对敌斗争松一松，阶级敌人就攻一攻。有的已被揪出来的阶级敌人，用“糖衣炮弹”向革命群众进攻；有些荫蔽着的敌人，则在生产中大搞破坏活动。他们煽阴风，点鬼火，挑拨工人之间的团结，散布无政府主义和反革命经济主义。在这种情况下，革委会同志一天到晚从这个工段跑到那个工段，忙于处理生产问题。广大革命群众眼看着阶级敌人在暗中捣乱和破坏，生产上不去，心里非常着急。因为放松了阶级斗争，月底一算，钢产量比八月份差了一千吨。
    但是就在九月份，第三班由于狠抓了阶级斗争，大办毛泽东思想学习班，放手发动群众，深入开展革命大批判，钢产量不仅没有下降，而且在品种、质量、成本、消耗等方面，都创造了出色的成绩。三班工人说得好：千忙万忙，阶级斗争不可忘。革命是推动生产发展的动力，只有狠抓革命，才能猛促生产。
    举旗抓纲，革命生产蒸蒸日上
    中央两报一刊国庆社论和《红旗》杂志第四期社论的发表，传达了毛主席最新的战斗号令。车间革委会对照九月份的工作，认真学习了社论，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，同时深入斗争第一线，进行了调查研究。他们面对着许多触目惊心的阶级斗争事实，总结了经验教训，从而提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。许多同志深有感触地说，前一时期，我们放松了对敌斗争，把阶级敌人放在一边不批不斗，结果他们到处兴妖作怪，破坏革命和生产，这是严重的教训！他们说，第三班的经验告诉我们，只有牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，时刻不忘“举旗抓纲”——高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争这条纲，以“纲”带钢，才能促进生产的不断发展。要是只就生产抓生产，不但搞不好生产，而且还会走到刘少奇所鼓吹的“生产第一”的修正主义邪路上去。
    思想认识提高了，抓工作就有了正确的方向。各班组都以车间和厂部揪出来的阶级敌人为活生生的事例，上挂叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，展开了革命大批判。通过革命大批判，极大地提高了广大工人群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，从而迅速改变了生产跃不上去的局面。十月份，全车间钢产量又打破了八月份的高产水平。十一月份以来，新纪录一个接一个，钢的月产量又跃进到了新的水平上。
