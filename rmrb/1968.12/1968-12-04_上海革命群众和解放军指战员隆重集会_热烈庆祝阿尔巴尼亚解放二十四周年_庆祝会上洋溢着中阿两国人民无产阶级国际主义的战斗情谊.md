Shanghai revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers held a grand meeting to celebrate the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation. The meeting was filled with the fighting camaraderie of proletarian internationalism between the peoples of China and Albania.

According to Xinhua News Agency Shanghai, December 3rd, over a thousand Shanghai revolutionary masses and soldiers from the PLA Shanghai garrison held a grand meeting today to celebrate the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Albania's Ambassador to China, Minister Plenipotentiary Agolli, and his wife specially came to Shanghai to participate in the celebration.

The meeting was filled with the fighting camaraderie of proletarian internationalism between the peoples of China and Albania. Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Wang Hongwen, and Albania's Ambassador to China, Minister Plenipotentiary Agolli, both spoke at the meeting. Wang Hongwen, in his speech, highly praised the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, for consistently holding high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. He praised the Albanian people for their unyielding struggle against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. He commended Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact, which had become a tool of Soviet revisionist aggression. He said that the Albanian people, through self-reliance and arduous struggle, have achieved one great victory after another in their socialist revolution and socialist construction. The recent revolutionary movement in Albania, which has profound socialist revolutionary significance, has provided valuable historical experience for the international proletarian dictatorship and made outstanding contributions to enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism.

Agolli spoke amidst enthusiastic applause. He introduced the brilliant achievements Albania has made in all fields over the past 24 years under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha. He then pointed out that the heroic deeds of the Shanghai people during the "January Revolution" storm are a great example of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

He said that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, is not only a victory for the socialist cause of the Chinese people but also a great victory for the revolutionary, socialist, and liberation causes of the world.

Agolli enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between Albania and China, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. He said that the Albanian people will forever stand together with the Chinese people, fight together, and win together.

The speeches by Comrade Wang Hongwen and Comrade Agolli were met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Albanian trainees in Shanghai were also invited to attend the celebration. Attending today's meeting were leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Wang Shaoyong and Feng Guozhu, responsible officials from the Shanghai garrison, Liu Wenxue, Duan Dezhang, and Wang Weiguo, as well as representatives from Shanghai workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, revolutionary mass organizations, and poor and lower-middle peasants. After the celebration, the Albanian film "Broad Horizons" was screened.
