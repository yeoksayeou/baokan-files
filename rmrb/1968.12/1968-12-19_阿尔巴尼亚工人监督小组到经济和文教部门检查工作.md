In response to the call of the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha to let the working class play a leading role in all aspects of national life, worker supervision groups from Albania have been inspecting work in economic and cultural departments. The workers brought proletarian ideology, high socialist consciousness, revolutionary spirit, and a fighting style, and were warmly welcomed and praised by the masses.

The Industrial and Mining Department held a meeting to discuss worker supervision work, with Comrade Mehmet Shehu attending and speaking at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 18th – According to reports from local newspapers, under the guidance of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha’s report on “Worker Supervision,” worker supervision groups and teams from Tirana, Gjirokastër, and Shkodër have recently been organized to inspect work in the service industries of commerce and medical care, as well as other departments. They brought the proletarian ideology, revolutionary spirit, high socialist consciousness, and fighting style of the working class to these units, and were warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses.

Since Comrade Enver Hoxha issued the call for “Worker Supervision” at the Labor Party Central Committee Secretariat meeting on April 9th this year, the broad masses of workers in Albania, under the leadership of the Labor Party, have used the party documents and Comrade Enver Hoxha’s works as their ideological weapons. They have combined the specific situations of factories and mines to study and discuss Comrade Enver Hoxha’s call. Through this study, the broad masses of workers have further raised their proletarian consciousness and have a deeper understanding of the great historical mission that the working class, as the leading class, bears in the process of realizing the revolutionization of national life and people’s thought.

To better play the leading role of the working class in various departments and to have a more powerful and active influence in the struggle against bourgeois ideology and manifestations, recently, the workers of Tirana, under the organization of the Tirana City Trade Union, selected a large number of outstanding workers to form worker supervision groups. They went to commercial units and medical care units to inspect work. They went deep into various stores and clinics to understand the situation of these units serving the masses and listening to the opinions of the masses, pushing the work of these units forward.

The workers of Elbasan, Shkodër, Fier, and Gjirokastër also selected their outstanding representatives and successively formed worker supervision teams and groups to inspect work in hundreds of units.

Currently, the scope of work inspections by worker supervision groups or teams has expanded from commercial and medical care units to other economic, educational, cultural, and scientific departments. For example, a worker supervision group from the Enver Mechanical Factory in Tirana recently inspected the work of the Natural Sciences Department of Tirana University, putting forward the requirements and hopes of the working class for the university in cultivating party and working-class warriors. The workers of the Leather Factory in Gjirokastër recently organized a worker supervision group to inspect the work of the “Azim Zeneli” Middle School, understanding the work and study situation of the teachers and students, holding a meeting with the students’ parents, and putting forward suggestions for improving political thought work. The worker supervision groups in Fier recently inspected the work of clubs and canteens. The worker supervision group of the Fier Fertilizer Factory also went to the countryside to inspect the storage and use of fertilizers.

To improve future work, some worker supervision groups also went to the municipal and district people’s congress executive committees to report the situation and put forward suggestions. Not long ago, the worker supervision group of Tirana held two meetings with the relevant department personnel of the municipal executive committee. At the meeting, the municipal executive committee personnel seriously listened to the suggestions for improvement put forward by the worker supervision group for the commercial and medical care departments.

Now, the supervision of the Albanian working class is becoming a powerful mass movement. Some cities that have already established worker supervision groups are preparing or have begun to expand to the countryside to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 18th – According to a report in the Albanian newspapers on the 18th, all the staff of the Albanian Ministry of Industry and Mining held a meeting on the 17th. Following the spirit of Comrade Enver Hoxha’s “Worker Supervision,” they discussed the work of the Ministry of Industry and Mining and its affiliated units over the past year. Advanced workers, leaders of industrial and mining enterprises, representatives of district people’s congress executive committees, and other units also participated in the meeting.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, attended the meeting and spoke.

Comrade Koco Theodhosi, Minister of Industry and Mining, made a report at the meeting. Many representatives introduced the experience of implementing worker supervision in their units at the meeting.

The meeting pointed out that to implement the task proposed by the Labor Party that the working class should play a leading role in all aspects of national life from a ideological and political perspective, work is being actively carried out in various places, and a series of measures have already been taken to combat bureaucracy, establish revolutionary work methods and styles, and further strengthen the connection with the masses.

The meeting pointed out that good results have been achieved in strengthening the connection with the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses, and letting the masses themselves participate in solving many important problems.

The meeting pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to continue to work actively to further strengthen the ideological and political education of the staff and regard this work as an important factor for better and correct understanding and implementation of worker supervision, and for expanding worker supervision in all fields and activities.

    响应伟大领袖霍查同志的号召　发挥工人阶级在国家全部生活中的领导作用
    阿尔巴尼亚工人监督小组到经济和文教部门检查工作
    工人们带去无产阶级思想、高度的社会主义觉悟、革命精神和战斗风格，受到广大群众热烈欢迎和赞扬
    工业和矿产部开会讨论工人监督的工作　谢胡同志出席会议并讲了话
    新华社地拉那十八日电　据这里报纸报道，在阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志关于“工人阶级监督”的报告指引下，阿尔巴尼亚地拉那、吉诺卡斯特和斯库台等地的工人，最近分别组织工人监督小组和工人监督队，到商业和医疗卫生等服务性行业以及其它部门检查工作。他们把工人阶级的无产阶级思想、革命精神、高度的社会主义觉悟和战斗风格，带到这些单位，受到广大人民群众的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    自从霍查同志今年四月九日在劳动党中央书记处会议上发出“工人阶级监督”的号召以来，阿尔巴尼亚广大工人在劳动党的领导下，以党的文件和霍查同志的著作作为思想武器，结合厂矿企业的具体情况，对霍查同志的号召进行了热烈的学习和讨论。通过学习，广大工人进一步提高了无产阶级觉悟，更加认识到工人阶级作为领导阶级在实现国家生活和人的思想革命化的过程中所担负的重大历史使命。
    为了更好地在各个部门发挥工人阶级的领导作用，在反对资产阶级的思想和表现的斗争中起到更有力、更积极的影响，最近，地拉那市的工人，在地拉那市工会的组织下，推选了大批优秀工人，组成了工人监督小组，到商业单位和医疗卫生单位检查工作。他们深入到各个商店和诊疗所，了解这些单位为群众服务和倾听群众意见等方面的情况，使这些单位的工作大大向前推进一步。
    爱尔巴桑、斯库台、费里和吉诺卡斯特等市的工人也推选了自己的优秀代表，相继组成工人监督队和工人监督小组，到数百个单位检查工作。
    目前，工人监督小组或工人监督队检查工作的范围已从商业和医疗卫生单位扩大到其它经济、教育、文化和科学部门。如地拉那恩维尔机械厂的一个工人监督小组最近已经到地拉那大学的自然科学系检查工作，向师生提出了工人阶级对大学在培养党和工人阶级的战士方面的要求和希望。吉诺卡斯特市皮革厂的工人不久前组织了一个工人监督小组到“阿齐姆·泽内利”中学检查工作，了解这个学校师生的工作和学习情况，同学生家长举行了座谈，并提出了改进政治思想工作的建议。费里市的一些工人监督小组最近到俱乐部、食堂等单位检查工作。费里氮肥厂的工人监督小组还到农村去检查化肥入仓和使用等情况。
    为了改进今后的工作，一些工人监督小组还到市和区人民会议执行委员会反映情况和提出建议。不久前，地拉那市工人监督小组曾经同市执行委员会有关部门的工作人员举行了两次会议。会上，市执行委员会的工作人员认真地听取了工人监督小组对商业和医疗卫生等部门所提出的改进意见。
    现在，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的监督正在变成一个群众性的强大运动。有一些城市已经成立起来的工人监督小组，正在准备或已经开始向农村扩展，以加强工农联盟。
    新华社地拉那十八日电　据阿尔巴尼亚报纸十八日报道，阿尔巴尼亚工业和矿产部全体工作人员十七日举行会议，根据恩维尔·霍查同志关于“工人阶级监督”的精神，对工业和矿产部及其所属单位一年来的工作进行了讨论。先进工人、工矿企业的负责人、各区人民会议执行委员会和其它单位的代表也参加了会议。
    阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡同志出席了会议，并讲了话。
    工业和矿产部部长科乔·蒂奥多西同志在会上作了报告。许多代表在会上介绍了本单位实行工人监督的经验。
    会议指出，为了从思想上和政治上贯彻劳动党提出的关于工人阶级在国家全部生活中应当起领导作用的任务，各地正在积极开展工作，并且已经采取了反对官僚主义；建立革命的工作方法和工作作风；更加密切联系群众等一系列措施。
    会议指出，在加强同群众的联系、倾听群众的意见和由群众自己参加解决许多重要问题方面，已经取得了良好的成果。
    会议指出，今后必须继续积极工作，以进一步加强对职工的思想和政治教育，并把这项工作看作是为更好地和正确地理解和实施工人阶级监督，为在一切领域和活动中扩大工人阶级监督的重要因素。
