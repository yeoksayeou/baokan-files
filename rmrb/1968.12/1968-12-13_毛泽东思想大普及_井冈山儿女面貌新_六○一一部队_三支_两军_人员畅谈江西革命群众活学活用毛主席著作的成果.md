The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party's communiqué points out: "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has rapidly spread among hundreds of millions of people and deeply entered their hearts. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have consciously studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in their struggles. This is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensuring that our country will never change color." Recently, representatives attending the conference of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought from the 601st Division of the People's Liberation Army, who come from the front lines of "three supports, two militarizations," studied this part of the communiqué. Reflecting on what they have seen and heard in factories and rural areas, they deeply felt that this part of the communiqué is completely correct. They enthusiastically discussed the situation in which the children of Jinggangshan have consciously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in their struggles, the unprecedented great popularization of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought throughout Jiangxi Province, and the extremely profound changes in people's spiritual outlook. They enthusiastically acclaimed this as a great achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The Red Sun Illuminates the Deep Mountains

Guo Qingliang, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a platoon leader, said:

A young production team leader from Gangkou Commune, Tónggǔ County, told us that before the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the old county committee were extremely afraid that the poor and lower-middle peasants would grasp Mao Zedong Thought. They used the inconvenience of transportation to block Mao Zedong's voice in every possible way. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants love to read Chairman Mao's books the most. They organized themselves to study Mao Zedong Thought. If there were no books, they would search everywhere. Some community members went into the mountains to copy Chairman Mao's quotations to study. The capitalist roaders were terrified of this and said nonsense like, "What's the use of mountain people studying Chairman Mao's works? It's better to produce more grain." They used the excuse of production to pile up production tasks, trying to squeeze out the time for the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works. After the storm of the Cultural Revolution swept through this mountain village, the poor and lower-middle peasants rose up to rebel against the capitalist roaders, smashed their blockade, and said, "Growing grain can only solve the problem of hunger, but studying Mao Zedong Thought can ensure that our country does not change color. Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must read them every day, every year, forever!" Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants study Chairman Mao's works more consciously and frequently. Every household has set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and even during rest times in the fields, they seize the time to study. The Shangkeng Production Team has six housewives living on two hills. Despite having many children, busy household chores, and long distances, they often gather together to read Chairman Mao's books. They said, "Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, opposes us reading Chairman Mao's books and blocks Chairman Mao's voice, trying to separate our hearts from Chairman Mao and make us walk the capitalist black road. This is just a daydream!"

In the past, this brigade rarely heard Chairman Mao's voice. Now, as soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, and the proletarian headquarters issues battle orders, the cadres use telephones and human transmission to quickly spread Chairman Mao's voice throughout the mountain areas, letting the brilliance of the red sun quickly shine on every village.

A Steel Wall Against Revisionism

Li Bangfa, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a company commander, said:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great mass movement for the great popularization of Mao Zedong Thought. In this movement, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have consciously studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. The great Mao Zedong Thought has deeply taken root in people's minds, building a steel wall against revisionism. This is the fundamental guarantee for ensuring that our country will never change color.

After Tang Dongbo, a worker from Fuzhou Cotton Textile Mill, was elected as the deputy director of the revolutionary committee, a hidden counter-revolutionary element in the revolutionary ranks tried to deceive him, attempting to pull Tang Dongbo down with him. This guy saw that Tang Dongbo had difficulties at work and pretended to help. No matter what happened, he pretended to be enthusiastic and reported to Tang Dongbo. When it got cold, he pretended to be caring and let Tang Dongbo wear his coat. Sometimes, in front of the masses, he praised Tang Dongbo's work and his awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. This series of phenomena made Tang Dongbo think deeply: why did the masses elect me to the revolutionary committee, and this person is so attentive to me? Tang Dongbo brought this question back to study Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Chairman Mao taught: "Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to praise us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, which has been proven. The bourgeoisie's praise can conquer the weak-willed in our ranks." Chairman Mao's teachings made Tang Dongbo raise his revolutionary vigilance and smash the enemy's sugar-coated bullet attack. Later, that counter-revolutionary element, under the pretext of discussing problems with Tang Dongbo, set up a grand banquet at home to treat Tang Dongbo. Tang Dongbo immediately exposed his plot. Tang Dongbo also made public the ironclad evidence of this class enemy's sugar-coated bullet attack, educating the broad revolutionary masses and all members of the revolutionary committee, letting everyone sharpen their eyes, raise their revolutionary vigilance, and enhance their ability to prevent and oppose revisionism.

A New Spiritual Outlook and Great Material Force

Li Wenhong, the younger brother of Li Wenzhong, the deputy squad leader of the "Support the Left and Love the People Model Squad" and the "Support the Left and Love the People Model," said:

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has washed away the mud and dirt left over from thousands of years of the old society. Mao Zedong Thought has made the spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary people completely new. This year, our squad went to Changeng Township, Xiangcheng Village, Xinjian County to carry out the "Support Agriculture" mission. In this village of less than fifty households, there was a sharp class struggle before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Originally, there were some wastelands to the northeast of the village, which were drainage ditches during the rainy season and could not be farmed. However, a landlord named Tan, with ulterior motives, used feudal clan relationships to collude and deceive some members of the team, turning these wastelands into farmland. During the rainy season, he released all the water into the fields of other production teams, damaging the crops. For this, the two production teams had caused many disputes. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle over and over again in light of the class struggle situation in their brigade. Chairman Mao's words were like sunlight, dispelling the fog in everyone's hearts. The poor and lower-middle peasants exposed the landlord element who instigated clan struggles and linked his sabotage activities with Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies, deeply criticized and fiercely fought against him, and implemented mass dictatorship over him. Since then, the barriers between the two teams have been eliminated, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have united like one person. They mobilized collective power, cooperated with each other, and built a water canal over two thousand meters long. During the rainy season, it drains water, and during the dry season, it irrigates, achieving a bumper harvest this year.

Li Zhengquan, an active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought and a military representative stationed at the Nanchang Rubber Factory, said:

After the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been grasped by all revolutionary workers in the Nanchang Rubber Factory, becoming an indomitable great force.

In the past, under the control of the capitalist roaders, the Nanchang Rubber Factory had strict rules and regulations. Looking up, there were "reward and punishment regulations," looking down, there were "inspection rules," and moving a foot or raising a hand was not in violation of one rule or touching another clause. In the Cultural Revolution, the worker masses took up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking those foreign frameworks and old rules, and became the masters themselves. Now, every workshop has become a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, with production booming and technological innovations blooming. According to the past foreign frameworks and old rules, vulcanizing pots could only be used from abroad, and the sand for making shoe lasts could only be from Zijin Mountain; otherwise, the rubber factory could not produce rubber shoes. The worker masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, cast off these foreign frameworks and old rules. They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and in just fifteen days, successfully trial-produced a vulcanizing pot with better quality than foreign products. At the same time, the shoe last workers found sand with good performance in the province, meeting the production needs. The broad worker masses said, "We are Chairman Mao's workers. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we can transform everything and create everything!"

    毛泽东思想大普及　井冈山儿女面貌新
    六○一一部队“三支”“两军”人员畅谈江西革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的成果
    据新华社南昌十二日电　党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报指出：“在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东思想在亿万人民中迅速地传播，深入人心，广大工农兵群众在斗争中自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，这是巩固无产阶级专政、使我国永不变色的根本保证。”最近，出席人民解放军六○一一部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的代表、来自“三支”、“两军”第一线的指战员们，学习公报的这一段话，回想自己在工厂、农村的所见所闻，深深体会到公报的这段话完全正确。他们热情地畅谈了井冈山儿女在斗争中自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在江西全省空前大普及的情况，以及人们精神面貌所发生的极其深刻的变化，热烈欢呼这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果！
      红太阳照亮了深山区
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、排长郭庆亮说：
    铜鼓县港口公社水平大队的一位年青的生产队长告诉我们说，文化大革命以前，旧县委内一小撮走资派极端害怕贫下中农掌握毛泽东思想，利用交通不便，百般封锁毛主席的声音。但是，贫下中农最爱读毛主席的书。他们自己组织起来学习毛泽东思想，没有书，就四处寻找，有的社员出山把毛主席语录抄回去学习。走资派对此怕得要命，胡说什么“山里人学啥毛主席著作，还是多生产些粮食吧”，便以抓生产为名，拚命地加生产任务，企图把贫下中农学习毛主席著作的时间挤掉。文化大革命的风暴席卷这个山村后，贫下中农起来造了走资派的反，摧毁了走资派的封锁，他们说，种粮食只能管饥饱，学习毛泽东思想才能保证我们国家不变颜色。毛主席的书是我们贫下中农的命根子，我们就是要天天读，年年读，永远读！现在，贫下中农学习毛主席著作更自觉、更经常了，家家户户办起了毛泽东思想学习班，就是田间劳动休息时，也抓紧时间学习。上坑生产队有六个家庭妇女，居住在两个山头上。她们不顾孩子多、家务忙、路途远，经常凑到一起读毛主席的书。她们说：“刘少奇这个大坏蛋反对我们读毛主席的书，封锁毛主席的声音，妄想把我们的心和毛主席隔开，叫我们走资本主义黑路，这是白天作梦！”
    过去这个大队常年听不到毛主席的声音。如今，毛主席的最新指示一发表，无产阶级司令部一发布战斗号令，干部们就用电话传，人工传，迅速地把毛主席的声音传遍山区，让红太阳的光辉迅速照遍各山村。
        筑起了防修反修的钢铁长城
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、连长李帮法说：
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是毛泽东思想大普及的伟大群众运动。在这个运动中，广大革命群众和革命干部在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，伟大的毛泽东思想在人们头脑中深深扎根，筑起了一道防修反修的钢铁长城，这是使我国永不变色的根本保证。
    抚州棉纺织厂的工人唐东波同志被选为厂革委会副主任后，有个埋藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子想蒙混过关，妄图拉唐东波同志下水。这个家伙看到唐东波工作上有什么困难，就假惺惺地帮着干，不管有什么事情他都假装积极，向唐东波“请示”。天冷了，他装出“关心”的样子，把自己的大衣让给唐东波穿。有时当着群众的面吹捧唐东波工作如何如何好，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟如何如何高。这一连串的现象，引起了唐东波的深思：为什么群众把我选进革委会后，这个人对我这样殷勤呢？唐东波带着这个问题，重新学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告。毛主席教导说：“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。”毛主席的教导，使唐东波同志提高了革命警惕，粉碎了阶级敌人的糖弹进攻。后来，那个反革命分子假借找唐东波谈问题，在家里大摆酒席请唐东波吃，唐东波当场就揭露了他的阴谋。唐东波同志并把这个阶级敌人施放糖衣炮弹的铁证公诸于众，教育广大革命群众和革委会的全体同志，让大家擦亮眼睛，提高革命警惕性，增强防修反修的能力。
    崭新的精神面貌　伟大的物质力量
      “支左爱民模范排”副班长、“支左爱民模范”李文忠的弟弟李文红说：
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，荡涤了旧社会几千年遗留下来的污泥浊水，毛泽东思想使广大革命人民的精神面貌焕然一新。今年，我们排到新建县望城岗公社长埇大队执行“支农”任务。这个不到五十户的村子里，在无产阶级文化大革命之前，一直存在着尖锐的阶级斗争。这个村的东北面原来有一些荒田，本来雨季就是排水沟，不能种庄稼，可是一个姓谈的地主别有用心地利用封建宗族关系，拉拢蒙蔽队里的一些群众，把这些荒田开垦出来，雨季一到又把水全部放到别的生产队的田里，冲坏庄稼。为此，两个生产队曾经引起过多次纠纷。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，针对本大队的阶级斗争情况，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导。毛主席的话象阳光，驱散了大家心头的迷雾。贫下中农把那个挑动宗族斗争的地主分子揪出来，把他的破坏活动同他的黑主子刘少奇的反动谬论挂上钩，深批、狠斗，对他实行了群众专政。从此以后，这两个队之间的隔阂消除了，贫下中农团结得象一个人一样。他们发挥集体的力量，互相协作，修筑了一条长达两千多米的水渠，雨季排水，旱季引水，今年获得了大丰收。
    活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、驻南昌橡胶厂军代表李正荃说：
    南昌橡胶厂经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，战无不胜的毛泽东思想为全厂革命职工所掌握，变成了无坚不摧的巨大力量。
    过去，在走资派控制下的南昌橡胶厂，法规森严，抬头是“奖惩规定”，低头是“检查规则”，脚一动，手一抬，不是违犯了这一条，就是触动了那一款。在文化大革命中，工人群众奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，打破了那些洋框框和旧条条，自己做了主人。如今，个个车间都成了活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，生产搞得有声有色，技术革新万紫千红。按照过去洋框框和旧条条规定，硫化缸只能用外国的，制鞋楦的砂子只能用紫金山的，不然，橡胶厂就做不出胶鞋。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人群众，甩掉这些洋框框和旧条条，他们活学活用毛主席著作，仅用十五天的时间，就试制成功一个质量超过外国货的硫化缸。同时，鞋楦工人在本省找到了性能良好的砂子，满足了生产需要。广大工人群众说，我们是毛主席的工人，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们能改造一切，能创造一切！
