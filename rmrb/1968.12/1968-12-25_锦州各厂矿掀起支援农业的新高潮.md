The revolutionary workers of all industrial and mining enterprises in Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. While fully implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and doing a good job in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform, they have launched a new wave of support for agriculture.

Many industrial and mining enterprises in the city have sent propaganda teams composed of veteran workers to rural areas to carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They help the poor and lower-middle peasants repair agricultural machinery, teach them technical skills, and investigate the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants for agricultural machinery. The Jinzhou Petroleum Factory No. 6 sent a propaganda team of workers to remote mountainous areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, help the Yixian Liulonggou Commune to develop water conservancy projects, lay 22 kilometers of power lines, and train 25 electricians for the commune. The revolutionary workers of the Jinzhou City Linghe District Electrical Machinery Factory, with deep class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, overcame numerous difficulties and, despite the poor equipment, fought for 40 days to successfully trial-manufacture a submersible pump that is highly welcomed in rural areas.

    锦州各厂矿掀起支援农业的新高潮
    辽宁省锦州市各工矿企业广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在全面落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，搞好斗、批、改的同时，掀起了一个支援农业的新高潮。
    全市许多工矿企业派出了由老工人组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村和贫下中农一起搞斗、批、改，帮助贫下中农修理农机具，传授技术，调查贫下中农对农机具的需要。锦州石油六厂，派出工人毛泽东思想宣传队深入偏僻山区宣传毛泽东思想，帮助义县留龙沟公社兴办水利，架设输电线路二十二公里，还为公社培训了二十五名电工。锦州市凌河区电机厂的革命职工，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，克服了重重困难，在设备简陋的情况下，奋战四十天，试制成功了农村非常欢迎的潜水泵。　（据新华社讯）
