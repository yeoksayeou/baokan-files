The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team's primary focus in re-educating revolutionary teachers and students is on the struggle between the two lines.

The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Hangzhou University, in close collaboration with the People's Liberation Army, has led the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students in deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. This effort has helped them continuously raise their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, thereby promoting the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

When the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team first entered the school, they encountered a problem: what should be the primary focus in re-educating intellectuals? They studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals. Chairman Mao said: "Under the leadership of the correct line, workers, peasants, and soldiers should re-educate them, thoroughly changing their old thoughts." The Worker Propaganda Team studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, in light of the fierce struggle between the two classes and the two lines within the school, clearly recognized that in re-educating intellectuals, the primary focus should be on education about the struggle between the two lines. If they do not understand what the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is and what the reactionary bourgeois line represented by Liu Shaoqi is, they will not be able to distinguish between new thoughts and old thoughts. Therefore, the first step is to help revolutionary teachers and students raise their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promoting the transformation of their old thoughts.

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; it should be known to the broad revolutionary masses," was issued, the Worker Propaganda Team repeatedly studied it. In accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, they seriously summarized the situation and experience of educating revolutionary teachers and students about the struggle between the two lines since entering the school. They further recognized that the working class can lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure domain, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school to the end, it still relies on Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, conducting in-depth education on the struggle between the two lines for revolutionary teachers and students is the most important education, helping revolutionary teachers and students raise their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines is the most fundamental consciousness, and leading the broad revolutionary teachers and students to firmly grasp Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and carry the revolution to the end is the highest responsibility of the Worker Propaganda Team.

As their understanding deepened, the Worker Propaganda Team integrated education on the struggle between the two lines into all aspects of re-educating intellectuals, using Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to guide everything, drive everything, and transform everything. They adopted various methods such as organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, setting up class education exhibition halls, holding reminiscence and bitterness sessions, and carrying out revolutionary criticism, leading the broad revolutionary teachers and students to launch a study movement on the history of the struggle between the two lines.

The Worker Propaganda Team realized through practice that to raise the consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary teachers and students, they must guide revolutionary teachers and students to extensively discuss the history of the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by Liu Shaoqi, enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and deeply understand Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. When the Worker Propaganda Team led revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and the important editorial "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" by the People's Daily, Jiefangjun Daily, and Hongqi Magazine, they adopted the method of combining the reminiscence of the history of the struggle between the two lines with reminiscing bitterness, and combining the reminiscence of the history of the struggle between the two lines with the actual struggle between the two lines in the school. They turned the process of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines into a process of enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and thoroughly criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Through study, praise, and criticism, the broad revolutionary teachers and students further recognized that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of the proletariat and revolutionary people, while Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is the death line of the laboring people. They resolved to carry the revolution to the end according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

To help revolutionary teachers and students better raise their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, the Worker Propaganda Team also fully utilized Liu Shaoqi and local and school negative examples in the struggle against the enemy, guiding revolutionary teachers and students to receive education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Revolutionary teachers and students in the Geography Department, under the leadership of the Worker Propaganda Team, set up an exhibition hall praising Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They brought a small group of class enemies protected by Liu Shaoqi and his agents to the exhibition hall and displayed the evidence of this small group of class enemies implementing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They used these negative examples to extensively discuss the history of the struggle between the two lines within the school and also invited workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students who had suffered from the exploitation and persecution of these class enemies to make blood-and-tear accusations and carry out on-site criticism in the exhibition hall. A large number of vivid and shocking class struggle teaching materials deeply educated the entire department and the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students.

Due to the Worker Propaganda Team's focus on class struggle and education on the struggle between the two lines, the consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary teachers and students rapidly increased. They, according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, focused on the struggle, criticism, and transformation of various items such as cleaning up the class ranks. A student in the Chinese Department, due to the increased consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, bravely went to the front line of the struggle against the enemy, cooperating with the entire department's revolutionary teachers and students to expose a deeply hidden and cleverly disguised bad element.

    工人毛泽东思想宣传队对革命师生进行再教育主要抓什么？
    首先要抓好两条路线斗争的教育
    驻杭州大学工人宣传队采用办学习班、办阶级教育展览馆、开展忆苦思甜和革命大批判等办法，大大提高了广大革命师生的觉悟，推动了全校的斗批改
    新华社杭州十九日电　驻杭州大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队在解放军战士密切配合下，带领全校革命师生深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，帮助他们不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队刚开进学校的时候，碰到这样一个问题：对知识分子进行再教育主要抓什么？他们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示。毛主席说：“要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。”工人宣传队学习毛主席的最新指示，联系进校后亲眼看到的学校内两个阶级、两条路线激烈斗争的事实，明确地认识到，对知识分子进行再教育，首先要抓两条路线斗争教育，如果不使他们懂得什么是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，什么是以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，他们就分不清什么是新思想，什么是旧思想。因此，首先要帮助革命师生提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进他们改变旧思想。毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表后，工人宣传队反复学习，对照毛主席的教导，认真总结了进校以来对革命师生进行两条路线斗争教育的情况和经验，进一步认识到，工人阶级能够领导上层建筑领域的斗、批、改，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想和执行毛主席的革命路线，要把学校的斗、批、改进行到底，还是靠毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线。为此，对革命师生深入进行两条路线斗争教育是最重要的教育，帮助革命师生提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟是最根本的觉悟，带领广大革命师生牢牢掌握毛主席的革命路线，把革命进行到底，是工人宣传队的最高职责。随着认识的不断提高，工人宣传队把两条路线斗争教育贯串到对知识分子进行再教育的各个方面，用毛主席的革命路线去统帅一切、推动一切、改造一切。他们采用办毛泽东思想学习班、办阶级教育展览馆、开忆苦思甜会、开展革命大批判等各种办法，领导广大革命师生展开了两条路线斗争史的学习运动。
    工人宣传队在实践中体会到，要提高广大革命师生阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，必须引导革命师生大讲特讲毛主席的革命路线同以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线斗争的历史，热烈赞颂毛主席的革命路线，深刻理解毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说。工人宣传队在领导革命师生反复学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，学习中央两报一刊重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》的时候，采用回忆两条路线斗争史同忆苦思甜相结合，回忆两条路线斗争史同本校两条路线斗争实际相结合的办法，把学习两条路线斗争史的过程，变成热烈赞颂毛主席的革命路线，大批特批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线的过程。通过学习、颂扬和批判，广大革命师生进一步认识到毛主席的革命路线是无产阶级和革命人民的生命线，刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线是劳动人民的死亡线。他们决心按照毛主席的革命路线把革命进行到底。
    工人宣传队为了帮助革命师生更好地提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，还充分运用刘少奇以及本地本校的反面教员，在对敌斗争中引导革命师生接受阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育。地理系的革命师生在工人宣传队的领导下，举办了一个歌颂毛主席的革命路线，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线的展览馆。他们把刘少奇及其代理人所保护的一小撮阶级敌人揪到展览馆里，并展出了这一小撮阶级敌人推行刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的罪证，利用这些反面教员，大讲校内两条路线斗争史，同时还请受过这些阶级敌人剥削和迫害的工人、贫下中农和革命师生在展览馆里进行血泪控诉，开展现场批判。大量触目惊心的阶级斗争的活教材，使全系和全校革命师生受到一次生动、深刻的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育。
    由于工人宣传队狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育，全校广大革命师生阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高。他们按照毛主席的革命路线狠抓清理阶级队伍等斗、批、改的各项工作。中文系的一个同学，由于提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，他勇敢地杀上了对敌斗争第一线，配合全系革命师生，把一个隐藏得很深，伪装得很巧妙的坏家伙挖了出来。
