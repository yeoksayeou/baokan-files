In the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, tempering the red heart of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao; generation after generation resolutely executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The broad revolutionary people of Guizhou say: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the red line leading to communism; Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is the black line of restoring capitalism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou, December 15th: A massive movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines has swept through the cities and countryside of Guizhou Province, powerfully promoting the in-depth development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be frequently and repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." After this latest instruction from Chairman Mao and the re-publication of Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee, Guizhou's cities and countryside quickly organized tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. Various levels of revolutionary committees also organized over 30,000 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which entered factories, fields, schools, streets, and offices, vigorously launching propaganda on the history of the struggle between the two lines.

Members of various levels of revolutionary committees and the broad revolutionary masses, through the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, recalled and compared, thoroughly exposed the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party who attempted to restore capitalism, saw the necessity and timeliness of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao; thoroughly discussed the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, praising Chairman Mao's great wisdom and unparalleled correctness; thoroughly laid out the situation of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in this region and unit, seeing the importance of raising awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Through thorough exposure, discussion, and laying out, the broad revolutionary masses further strengthened their unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi, workers, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards from various factories, offices, and schools came to the "Zunyi Conference Site" to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. They invited old Red Army soldiers to talk about the history of the struggle between the two lines during the Long March, invited old workers and old poor peasants who had seen the great leader Chairman Mao to talk about their history of struggle against landlords and capitalists and their happy history of standing up and becoming masters after liberation, as well as the extremely sharp and intense struggle between the two lines during the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through recalling and comparing, the people of Zunyi further loved Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the red line leading to communism, Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is the black line of restoring capitalism. We must generation after generation resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The broad masses of people throughout the province, in their studies, closely linked the actual struggle between the two lines in their region and unit, fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "theory of the tamed tool," and other black "six theories." They held various forms of criticism meetings, denunciation meetings, and struggle meetings, launching fierce attacks on the running dogs of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi and his agents. Red Lake Machinery Factory, Qian Guang Aluminum Products Factory, and other industrial and mining enterprises held revolutionary criticism and struggle meetings on the spot, using a large number of shocking exhibits and pictures of class enemies' evil activities, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary workers.

The broad revolutionary masses throughout the province carried forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, closely linking the in-depth development of the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines with the current struggle, criticism, and transformation, powerfully promoting the progress of various tasks in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Revolutionary medical workers on the health front, through their studies, further raised their awareness of executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," launching a new high tide of settling down in the countryside. Currently, over 4,000 medical and health workers have settled down in the countryside, treating diseases for poor and lower-middle peasants on one hand and accepting re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants on the other. The broad Red Guards and revolutionary youth throughout the province, under the leadership of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in schools, seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and eagerly requested to go to the mountains and countryside, walking the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Currently, over 50,000 young intellectuals have settled down in the countryside throughout the province, tempering their red hearts of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao in the three great revolutionary struggles.

    据新华社贵阳十五日电　贵州省城乡掀起了声势浩大的两条路线斗争史的学习运动，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席的这一最新指示传来和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告重新发表后，贵州城乡迅速举办了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，学习两条路线斗争史。各级革委会还组织了三万多个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、田间、学校、街道、机关，大张旗鼓地展开两条路线斗争史的宣传。
    各级革委会成员和广大革命群众在两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，通过回忆对比，大揭叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇等党内一小撮走资派妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，看毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的必要性和及时性；大讲毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果，颂扬毛主席的英明伟大和无比正确；大摆本地区、本单位两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的情况，看提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟的重要性。通过大揭、大讲、大摆，更加增强了广大革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱。
    在革命历史名城遵义，各工厂、机关、学校的工人、革命干部、红卫兵小将来到“遵义会议会址”学习党内两条路线斗争的历史。他们请老红军讲长征时党内两条路线斗争史，请当年见过伟大领袖毛主席的老工人、老贫农讲他们与地主、资本家的斗争史和解放后翻身作主人的幸福史，以及无产阶级文化大革命两年多来极其尖锐、极其剧烈的两条路线斗争史。通过回忆、对比，遵义儿女更加热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们说，毛主席的革命路线，是通向共产主义的红线，刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，是复辟资本主义的黑线。我们要世世代代坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
    全省广大人民群众在学习中紧密联系本地区、本单位两条路线斗争的实际，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”等黑“六论”。他们举行各种形式的批判会、声讨会、斗争会，向帝、修、反的走狗刘少奇及其代理人猛烈开火。红湖机械厂、黔光铝制品厂等工矿企业，举办了革命大批判现场会，以大量触目惊心的阶级敌人进行罪恶活动的实物和图片，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，极大地提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    全省各地广大革命群众发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，把深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动与当前正在进行的斗、批、改紧密结合起来，有力地推动了斗、批、改各项工作的进展。卫生战线上的广大革命卫生工作人员通过学习，进一步提高了执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，掀起了一个到农村安家落户的新高潮。目前，已有四千多名医疗卫生人员下到农村安家落户，一面为贫下中农治病，一面接受贫下中农的再教育。全省广大红卫兵小将、革命知识青年在驻校工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，认真学习两条路线斗争史，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，纷纷要求上山下乡，走与工农兵相结合的道路。现在，全省已有五万多名知识青年到农村落户，在三大革命斗争实践中，锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心。
