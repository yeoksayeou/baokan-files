Based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "the working class must lead in everything," we suggest that urban schools and factories be combined, with each school linked to a specific factory. The factory will manage the school, and a revolutionary committee composed of workers, soldiers, and teachers will be established to lead the school's educational revolution. Students will be managed under a regional responsibility system, integrating school education with extracurricular education and combining in-school education with preschool education. This will ensure that children, from the moment they begin to interact with society, receive education in Mao Zedong Thought. We believe that this approach is in line with the direction of the urban educational revolution, meets the needs of the broad laboring masses, and aligns with the wishes of revolutionary educators.

The benefits are as follows:

1. It truly implements Chairman Mao's great teaching that "to achieve a proletarian educational revolution, the working class must lead, and workers must participate, along with soldiers, and with the active elements among students, teachers, and workers who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end." It ensures that the power of the educational revolution is firmly in the hands of the working class, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers forever.

2. Direct management of schools by factories helps to thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line. Schools can be transformed in the image of the working class, ensuring that education does not deviate from politics, production labor, or the three great revolutionary movements. Education can be integrated with production labor, practice, and the masses, cultivating reliable successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

3. It facilitates the re-education of intellectuals by workers and peasants. In the past, teachers and staff have long been detached from labor, practice, and the masses. After factories manage schools, teachers can take turns participating in labor in shifts, receiving re-education from workers and peasants, thoroughly changing their old ideas, and becoming intellectuals welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

4. Implementing the regional responsibility system, factories, schools, and nearby neighborhoods work together to improve extracurricular education and preschool education. This will change the past situation where streets, kindergartens, and schools did not communicate with each other. Children from a young age will study Chairman Mao's works, the "Old Three Articles," and Chairman Mao's latest instructions; they will receive class education, cultivate a labor outlook, and develop class feelings of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This will fundamentally prevent the growth of revisionist elements.

5. It can reduce a large number of teachers and organize a new type of teaching force. Currently, the teaching staff in urban primary schools is large and diverse. After factories manage schools, excellent workers can teach courses on Mao Zedong Thought, class education, and production practice; following Chairman Mao's teachings, they can criticize bourgeois ideology at any time. Some of the original teachers can remain to guide students, while the rest can go to factories and rural areas to engage in labor, integrate with workers and peasants, and change their worldview.

    建议城市学校实行定厂定校和地区负责制的办法
    根据毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的教导，我们建议城市学校和工厂结合起来，定厂定校，以工厂管理学校，成立以工人阶级为主体的三结合的教育革命委员会，领导学校的教育革命。对学生采取地区负责制，把学校教育和校外教育结合起来，把在校教育和学龄前教育结合起来。使儿童从接触社会开始就受到毛泽东思想的教育。我们认为，这样做是符合城市教育革命方向的，符合广大劳动人民的要求，也符合我们革命教师的心愿。
    它的好处是：
    一、真正落实毛主席“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合”的伟大教导，把教育革命大权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手里，永远为工农兵服务。
    二、工厂直接管理学校，有利于彻底摧毁修正主义教育路线。可以按照工人阶级面貌改造学校。从而使学校教育工作不脱离政治，不脱离生产劳动，不脱离三大革命运动。教育工作就能够同生产劳动、实际、群众结合起来，把学生培养成无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    三、有利于知识分子接受工农兵再教育。过去教职员长期脱离劳动，脱离实际，脱离群众。工厂管理学校后，教员可以分期分批轮换参加劳动，以便接受工农兵再教育，彻底改变旧思想，成为工农兵所欢迎的知识分子。
    四、实行地区负责制，工厂、学校和附近街道结合起来，共同搞好校外教育工作和学龄前儿童的教育。彻底改变过去街道、幼儿园、学校互不通气的现象。少年儿童从幼年就大学毛主席著作，大学“老三篇”，大学毛主席一系列最新指示；进行阶级教育，培养劳动观点，树立无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的阶级感情。这样，从根本上杜绝修正主义苗子的产生。
    五、可以精简大批教师，组织一支新型的教师队伍。目前城市小学校教师队伍庞大而且成份复杂。工厂管理学校后，可由优秀工人讲毛泽东思想课、阶级教育课和生产实践课；遵照毛主席的教导，随时批判资产阶级。原有教师可留下一部分对学生进行辅导，其余的可到工厂、农村参加劳动，与工农相结合，改造世界观。
