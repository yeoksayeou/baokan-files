In 1945, our great leader Chairman Mao, at the Seventh National Congress of the Party, wisely proposed: "Mobilize the masses, expand the people's forces, under the leadership of our Party, defeat the invaders, and build a new China." This is a thorough revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, vigorously advocated the "peaceful democratic new stage." He ranted about how "the nationwide war has stopped," "there will be no civil war," and "in the future, the form of struggle in China will be non-military parliamentary struggle." He strongly opposed armed struggle and wanted us to join the Kuomintang in parliamentary struggle. This is a thorough line of capitulation.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, was forced by the political pressure of the entire nation to put on a "peaceful" act; on the other hand, because he was not yet prepared for a full-scale civil war at that time, he wanted to use "peace" to deceive and delay time, and thus convened the old Political Consultative Conference, reaching an agreement on paper.

At this time, Liu Shaoqi jumped out to advocate the parliamentary road, actually helping Chiang Kai-shek deceive the people. What is parliament? Parliament is a decoration of bourgeois dictatorship. Any class maintains its dictatorship through violence. Chiang Kai-shek's regime also relies on his eight million troops to maintain his reactionary rule. In capitalist countries, the size of parliamentary power, its existence or dissolution, is all decided according to the interests of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. Under Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule in China, there isn't even the false "democracy" of capitalist countries. Without defeating Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary armed forces, it is impossible to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and it is impossible to change the semi-colonial, semi-feudal nature of Chinese society. Under these circumstances, advocating the parliamentary road is to betray the revolution and surrender to Chiang Kai-shek.

Sometimes, we negotiate with the enemy, not to cooperate with the enemy, but to expose the enemy's counter-revolutionary plots. Chairman Mao went to Chongqing to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek, which politically put our Party in an advantageous position, making the Kuomintang reactionaries completely passive, and thoroughly exposing Chiang Kai-shek's peace talks plot. We have never placed our hopes on negotiations, but have always been prepared, maintaining high vigilance, standing on the self-defense position, and thoroughly defeating the invading enemy. We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions: "The people's armed forces, every gun, every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over," determined to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and build a new China. Under the wise leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with rifles and rice, defeated the enemy's planes and tanks, annihilated the Kuomintang's eight million troops, and thoroughly overthrew the reactionary rule of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, establishing the great People's Republic of China. The great victory of the War of Liberation once again proved the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If we had followed Liu Shaoqi's line of capitulation and taken the parliamentary road at that time, we would not have been able to stand firm in the liberated areas, let alone achieve revolutionary victory. As our great leader Chairman Mao taught: "In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no revolutionary victory."

From the old revisionist Bernstein to the modern revisionist Khrushchev, they have always been serving the bourgeoisie, vigorously advocating the parliamentary road. But in the mirror of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they all reveal their traitorous true colors. History has proven that the parliamentary road is a line of betrayal and capitulation. Why does Liu Shaoqi still pick up this piece of revisionist junk and advocate the parliamentary road? In a word, to adapt to the needs of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Liu Shaoqi advocates the parliamentary road, calling on us to lay down our weapons, is an attempt to disintegrate the People's Liberation Army, hand over China to American imperialism, and maintain the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, making China a colony of American imperialism. This fully exposes the counter-revolutionary face of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi.

### 议会道路就是投降路线

    议会道路就是投降路线
    海军某部副部队长  李如阜
    一九四五年，我们伟大领袖毛主席在党的第七次全国代表大会上英明地提出：放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我们党的领导下，打败侵略者，建设新中国。这是一条马克思列宁主义的彻底革命的路线。大内奸刘少奇却大肆鼓吹
  “和平民主新阶段”。他胡说什么“现在全国战争停止了”，“内战不会打了”，“今后中国之斗争形式是非武装的议会斗争”。他极力反对武装斗争，要我们和国民党一起去搞议会，进行议会斗争。这是一条彻头彻尾的投降路线。
    抗战胜利后，蒋介石一方面迫于全国人民的政治压力，不得不装出“和平”姿态；另一方面因为他当时对全面内战还没有准备好，想用“和平”欺骗来拖延时间，因而召开旧政协，达成了纸上的协议。
    在这个时候，刘少奇跳出来鼓吹走议会道路，实际上是帮助蒋介石对人民进行欺骗。议会是什么东西？议会是资产阶级专政的装饰物。任何阶级都是依靠暴力来维持他们的专政的。蒋介石的政权也是依靠他的八百万军队来维持其反动统治的。在资本主义国家里，议会权力的大小、它的存在或解散，都是根据垄断资产阶级的利益决定的。在蒋介石独裁统治下的中国，连资本主义国家虚伪的“民主”也没有。不打垮蒋介石的反动武装，就不能推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，就无法改变中国半殖民地半封建社会的性质。在这种情况下，鼓吹走议会道路，就是出卖革命，向蒋介石屈膝投降。
    有时候，我们和敌人谈判，那不是去和敌人搞合作，而是为了揭露敌人的反革命阴谋。毛主席去重庆与蒋介石谈判，在政治上使我党获得了主动，使国民党反动派完全陷于被动，彻底地揭露了蒋介石的和谈阴谋。我们从来不把希望寄托在谈判上，而是做好准备，保持高度警惕，随时站在自卫立场上，彻底消灭来犯的敌人。我们坚决执行毛主席的指示：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去”，决心打败国民党反动派，建设新中国。我们中国人民解放军在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，用小米加步枪打败了飞机加坦克，消灭了国民党八百万军队，彻底推翻了美帝国主义和蒋介石的反动统治，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。解放战争的伟大胜利，又一次证明了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无比英明，无比正确。假如我们当时执行刘少奇的投降路线，走议会道路，那我们在解放区就会站不住脚，更谈不上革命的胜利了。正如伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    从老修正主义伯恩斯坦到现代修正主义赫鲁晓夫，一直在为资产阶级效劳，大肆宣扬议会道路。但在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的照妖镜面前，他们都一个个现出叛徒的原形。历史事实证明，议会道路是一条出卖革命的投降路线。刘少奇为什么还要拾起这个修正主义的破烂货，鼓吹议会道路呢？一句话，为了适应美帝国主义和国民党反动派的需要。刘少奇鼓吹议会道路，叫我们放下武器，就是妄图瓦解人民解放军，把中国送给美帝国主义，妄图维护蒋介石匪帮的统治，使中国成为美帝国主义的殖民地。这充分暴露了刘少奇这个大内奸的反革命嘴脸。
