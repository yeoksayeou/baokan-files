The revolutionary workers of Benxi Steel Company, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. Their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness have reached unprecedented heights, powerfully promoting the rapid development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and production. They have achieved one new victory after another in the great struggle to seize the revolution and promote production.

Since this year, the total production value of this company has been higher each month, and each quarter has surpassed the previous one. The production volume and quality of major products such as pig iron, steel, steel products, metallurgical coke, artificial rich ore, sulfuric acid, and refractory bricks have all significantly increased, with many products exceeding historical production peaks. The number of new products developed by various factories and mines this year is equal to the total of new products from the previous three years. Since entering November, the steel products, refractory bricks, and sulfuric acid of Benxi Steel Plant and other factories and mines have respectively completed the annual national production plan 41 to 57 days ahead of schedule.

The great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation has promoted the deep development of the mass technical innovation and technological revolution movement. Since this year, this company has formed numerous "three-in-one" innovation teams from factories and mines to workshops, and from workshops to work groups, consisting of revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres. In eleven months, they have implemented more than 600 innovation projects, many of which have reached or exceeded domestic and world advanced levels.

    本溪钢铁公司职工夺得革命生产新胜利
    本溪钢铁公司的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，有力地推动了斗、批、改和生产的迅猛发展，在抓革命促生产的伟大斗争中取得了一个又一个新胜利。
    今年以来，这个公司的生产总值一月高过一月，一季超过一季。生铁、钢、钢材、冶金焦炭、人造富矿、硫酸、耐火砖等主要产品的产量和质量，都有大幅度提高，其中不少产品超过了历史最高生产水平。今年各厂矿试制成的新产品，等于前三年新产品的总和。进入十一月以来，本溪钢厂等厂矿的钢材、耐火砖、硫酸等产品，分别提前四十一天到五十七天完成了全年国家生产计划。
    伟大的斗、批、改高潮，促进了群众性技术革新和技术革命运动的深入开展。今年以来，这个公司从厂矿到车间，从车间到班组，组成了大批由革命工人、革命技术人员和革命干部参加的“三结合”革新小组，十一个月中就实现革新项目六百多项，其中不少项目达到或超过国内和世界的先进水平。
