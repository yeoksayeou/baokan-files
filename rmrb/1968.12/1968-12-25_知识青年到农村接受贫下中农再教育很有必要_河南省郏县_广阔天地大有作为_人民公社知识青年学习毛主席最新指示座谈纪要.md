The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "It is very necessary for intellectual youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, and university to the countryside. Each locality should mobilize them. Comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Over four hundred intellectual youth fighting in the "Broad Sky, Great Achievements" People's Commune in Jiongxian County, Henan Province, filled with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, combined their own practice in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside with a serious study and discussion of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They deeply felt that going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is the bright path for intellectual youth to combine with workers and peasants, the fundamental way to speed up the thought revolution of intellectual youth, and a long-term plan to prevent and oppose revisionism. They are determined to honestly receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants in the broad countryside, temper a red heart forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and bravely advance along the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao!

Going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is the bright path for intellectual youth to combine with workers and peasants.

The vice-chairman of the commune revolutionary committee and the returned intellectual youth Lu Zhongyang said: In the great upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation, Chairman Mao has issued another extremely important latest instruction, giving us intellectual youth the greatest education, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest impetus. Looking back at my own ten-year struggle in the countryside, I deeply feel that following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is the bright path for intellectual youth to combine with workers and peasants.

Chairman Mao taught us in a note he wrote in 1955 for the article "Experience in Planning Cooperativization in a Village": "All such intellectuals who can go to work in the countryside should happily go there. The countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." This village is today's "Broad Sky, Great Achievements" People's Commune. In 1958, following Chairman Mao's great instructions, I returned to my hometown with a red heart. A few days after arriving home, the poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as the accountant of the production team. Should I do it or not? At that time, I was undecided. The poor and lower-middle peasants gave me a class education, telling me the past history of class struggle and village suffering, which raised my class struggle awareness and made me understand the importance of managing the finances for the poor and lower-middle peasants. I bravely took on the work of the production team accountant. To prevent my thoughts from going astray and quickly grow into a successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause, the poor and lower-middle peasants often studied with me Chairman Mao's teaching that "We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution," educating me not to forget labor and to always maintain the character of the working people. With the enthusiastic help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, during the day I studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought with the poor and lower-middle peasants, worked together, and conducted scientific experiments. At night, I settled the team's accounts. I brought the problems I encountered during the day to Chairman Mao's works for consultation, consciously broke with selfishness and established public-mindedness, and guided all my words and deeds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, taking my first step on the bright path of combining with workers and peasants.

After tasting the sweetness of combining with workers and peasants, no matter what work I did or what problem I considered, I always consulted the poor and lower-middle peasants first. In this way, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I learned a lot of knowledge that I could not learn in school. My awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines continued to improve, and my initiative to study Chairman Mao's works continued to strengthen. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as a member of the provincial poor and lower-middle peasants' congress, a standing committee member and vice-chairman of the county and commune revolutionary committees. This is the poor and lower-middle peasants' greatest trust and encouragement to me. I will definitely not disappoint the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation of me, nor will I disappoint the poor and lower-middle peasants' expectations of me. I will more humbly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants and stride forward on the bright path of combining with workers and peasants!

Going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is the fundamental way for intellectual youth to speed up their thought revolution.

Zhao Fuzhang, an intellectual youth who moved to the countryside from Zhengzhou No. 24 Middle School, said: I am an intellectual youth who moved from Zhengzhou City to the countryside. In the past four months, I have received re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, which has surpassed the four years I spent in the old school. The process of settling down in the countryside is the process of receiving re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, constantly changing old thoughts, and achieving thought revolution. Because we have lived in the city for a long time, when we first came down to the countryside, we were not used to the rural life, and a few classmates had the mindset of "body in the countryside, heart in the city." The poor and lower-middle peasants discovered this and actively gave us a class struggle education course. Through reminiscence and comparison, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, they laid out the facts of the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, which raised our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and established a deep class feeling with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now we deeply understand: the only true school is the school of Mao Zedong Thought; the only true teacher is the working people; the only true path to revolution is to humbly accept the re-education of workers and peasants and follow the path of combining with workers and peasants. In the future, we will advance along the path of combining with the poor and lower-middle peasants under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

Intellectual youth going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is a long-term plan to prevent and oppose revisionism.

Xue Ximei, an intellectual youth who moved to the countryside from Zhengzhou No. 18 Middle School, said: I responded to Chairman Mao's great call four months ago and moved from Zhengzhou City to the countryside to settle down. When I first came to the countryside, there was an incident where I wore plastic slippers and went out with the community members to collect cow dung. When I saw the community members jumping into the dung pit to dig dung, I hesitated and jumped down with the "self" character. As soon as I jumped down, I stepped on cow dung, and I immediately stomped my feet. But when I saw the poor peasant Wang Huzhu rolling up his pants and stepping into the cow dung barefoot, I immediately felt my face burning hot. At this moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching that "comparing untransformed intellectuals with workers and peasants, we feel that intellectuals are not clean. The cleanest are still the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." I immediately realized that this was bourgeois thinking. I immediately took off my shoes and threw them aside. This was not just throwing away a pair of shoes, but throwing away bourgeois thinking and revisionist thinking. Now I deeply feel that intellectual youth combining with poor and lower-middle peasants and receiving re-education from them is a long-term plan to prevent and oppose revisionism.

The returned intellectual youth Liang Xiuying said: I am a native poor peasant girl from the countryside. In the past, I was used to labor and had feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Due to the poisoning of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, I gradually distanced myself from the poor and lower-middle peasants, yearned for the city, pursued eating, wearing, and living, and gradually slid into the revisionist quagmire. After graduating from high school in 1964, I returned from the city to the countryside and felt very uncomfortable. Later, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with the poor and lower-middle peasants, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, I gradually established the thought of doing revolution in the countryside for life. My process of changing thoughts is the process of receiving re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. I deeply feel that it is necessary for intellectual youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is absolutely indispensable!

    知识青年到农村接受贫下中农再教育很有必要
    ——河南省郏县“广阔天地大有作为”人民公社知识青年学习毛主席最新指示座谈纪要
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”战斗在河南省郏县“广阔天地大有作为”人民公社的四百多名知识青年，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，结合自己在农村三大革命运动中的实践，对毛主席的最新指示进行了认真的学习座谈。他们深有体会地说，到农村接受贫下中农的再教育，是知识青年与工农相结合的光辉道路，是加速知识青年思想革命化的根本途径，是防修反修的百年大计。他们决心在农村广阔天地里老老实实地接受贫下中农的再教育，锤炼永远忠于毛主席的一颗红心，沿着毛主席指引的光辉道路奋勇前进！
    到农村接受贫下中农的再教育，是知识青年与工农相结合的光辉道路
    公社革委会副主任、回乡知识青年卢忠阳说：在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，毛主席又发出了极其重要的最新指示，给了我们知识青年以最大的教育，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。回顾我自己在农村十年的战斗历程，深刻体会到：遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，到农村接受贫下中农的再教育，是知识青年与工农相结合的光辉道路。
    毛主席在一九五五年为《在一个乡里进行合作化规划的经验》一文所写的按语中教导我们：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”这个乡就是我们今天的“广阔天地大有作为”人民公社。一九五八年，我遵照毛主席的伟大教导，怀着一颗红心，回到我们家乡。到家不几天，贫下中农推选我当生产队的会计。干不干？当时我拿不定主意。贫下中农就对我进行阶级教育，讲过去的血泪家史和苦难村史，使我提高了阶级斗争觉悟，懂得了为贫下中农掌好财权的重要性，勇敢地担起了生产队会计的工作。贫下中农为了不使我的思想发岔，很快成长为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，经常和我在一起学习毛主席“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导，教育我不要忘掉劳动，永葆劳动人民的本色。在贫下中农的热情帮助下，白天我和贫下中农一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起劳动，一起搞科学实验，夜晚结算队里的账目。我带着一天遇到的问题，向毛主席著作请教，自觉地破私立公，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导自己的一切言行，使我在与工农相结合的光辉大道上迈出了第一步。
    我尝到与工农相结合的甜头以后，不论干什么工作，考虑什么问题，总是先向贫下中农请教。就这样，我在贫下中农的帮助下，学到了很多在学校学不到的知识，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟不断提高，学习毛主席著作的自觉性不断加强。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中农把我选为省贫代会委员，县、社革委会常委、副主任，这是贫下中农对我的最大信任和鞭策。我一定不辜负党和毛主席对我的培养，不辜负贫下中农对我的希望，更加虚心地接受贫下中农的再教育，在与工农相结合的光辉大道上阔步前进！
    到农村接受贫下中农的再教育，是知识青年加速思想革命化的根本途径
    郑州二十四中下乡落户的知识青年赵富章说：我是从郑州市到农村落户的知识青年。四个月来，我受到贫下中农的再教育，胜过了在旧学校里的四年。在农村安家落户的过程，就是我接受贫下中农再教育，不断改变旧思想，实现思想革命化的过程。由于我们长期生活在城市，刚下乡时，对农村生活不习惯，少数同学“人到农村，心还在城市”。贫下中农发现后，主动给我们上了阶级斗争教育课，通过回忆对比、忆苦思甜，大摆两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的事实，使我们提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，与贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情。现在，我们深刻懂得：真正的学校只有一所——毛泽东思想大学校；真正的老师只有一个——工农群众；真正的革命化道路只有一条——虚心接受工农的再教育，走与工农相结合的道路。今后，我们要在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，沿着同贫下中农相结合的革命化道路，阔步前进！
    知识青年到农村接受贫下中农的再教育，是防修反修的百年大计
    郑州十八中下乡落户的知识青年薛喜梅说：我是四个月以前响应毛主席的伟大号召，从郑州市来农村安家落户的。我刚到农村时，有一次，穿着塑料凉鞋和社员一起出牛粪，当我看到社员们都跳到粪坑里挖粪时，我犹豫地带着“私”字跳了下去。一跳下去就踩上了牛屎，我马上跺跺脚。但当我看到贫农王胡柱卷着裤子、赤着脚踏到牛粪上时，我立时觉得脸上热辣辣地发烧。这时，我想到了毛主席“拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净”的教导，立即认识到这是资产阶级思想。我马上把鞋脱掉，甩到一边。这不是甩掉一双鞋，而是甩掉了资产阶级思想，甩掉了修正主义思想。现在我深深体会到，知识青年和贫下中农相结合，接受贫下中农的再教育，是防修反修的百年大计。
    回乡知识青年梁秀英说：我是一个农村中土生土长的贫农女儿，过去劳动干得惯，对贫下中农有感情。由于受到刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，我慢慢脱离了贫下中农，向往城市，追求吃、穿、住，逐渐向修正主义泥坑里滑去。一九六四年从中学毕业后，由城市回到农村，感到很不适应。后来，和贫下中农一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起忆苦思甜，才逐渐树立了在农村干一辈子革命的思想。我的思想变化的过程，就是接受贫下中农再教育的过程。我深刻地体会到，知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，必要得很，万万缺不得！
