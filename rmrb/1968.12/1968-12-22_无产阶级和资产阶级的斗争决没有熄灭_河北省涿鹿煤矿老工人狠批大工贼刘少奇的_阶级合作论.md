The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the beginning of the socialist revolution. In this new stage, the fundamental contradiction within the country is between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The proletariat must learn to engage in various struggles against the bourgeoisie to establish and consolidate proletarian dictatorship and advance toward socialism. However, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi proposed and implemented a bourgeois reactionary line, vehemently opposing reliance on the working class and opposing the restriction and transformation of capitalism. He shamelessly advocated the "theory of class cooperation," attempting to make China regress to the old path of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism. This is a debt Liu Shaoqi owes to the Chinese people, and it must be thoroughly settled.

Old workers from the Zhuolu Coal Mine in Hebei Province have used their decades of experience to severely criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of class cooperation."

The old worker Ma Zhan-sheng, who has worked for capitalists for three generations, and the machine and electrical foreman Wang Guang-da, who has worked in the mines for decades, both said:

The essence of the "theory of class cooperation" is to develop capitalism.

On the eve of national liberation, the great leader Chairman Mao warned the entire Party and the people of the nation: "We must learn to engage in political, economic, and cultural struggles against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in the cities. If we do not pay attention to these issues and learn to engage in these struggles and achieve victory, we will not be able to maintain our power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail." At this great historical turning point, the traitor Liu Shaoqi jumped out, revealing the ferocious face of a bourgeois agent, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and frantically advocating for the development of urban and rural capitalism. He absurdly claimed, "China does not have too much capitalism; it has too little capitalism," and that the bourgeoisie should "not be restricted," advocating for "everyone to eat if there is food, and everyone to make money if there is money." He did not allow the working class to struggle against the capitalists, absurdly claiming that capitalists are "not the objects of our working class's struggle," even wanting the working class to make "friends" with the capitalists, advocating for "long-term cooperation" and "complete cooperation."

Chairman Mao instructed to utilize, restrict, and transform capitalism to build socialism; Liu Shaoqi, however, opposed restriction and transformation, advocating for reliance on capitalists and the development of capitalism. This is a struggle between two fundamentally opposed lines, relating to the fate of the working class and the fate of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line represents the fundamental interests of the working class, greatly boosting the morale of the working class. We are determined to follow this path. The traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, always calculates for the capitalists, provides ideas, and boosts their morale. His path is like a dark tunnel filled with poisonous gas; entering it means certain death. The working class will never follow that path.

Reflecting on the history of our mine since liberation, it is a history of the struggle between two paths and two lines. Shortly after liberation, the mine, which had been controlled by mine owners, foremen, and capitalists for decades, returned to the people. We "coal miners" had the right to restrict those mine owners, foremen, and capitalists who wore long gowns and carried horsewhips. In 1950, the coal mine began socialist transformation. A fierce struggle of restriction and counter-restriction unfolded. The representatives of the capitalist class openly demanded that workers obey their management; otherwise, they had the right to dismiss workers at any time. We workers saw through their tricks, did not fall for their deception, united as one, and engaged in a head-on struggle with the mine owners, foremen, and representatives of the capitalist class. We sternly questioned them: "The mine is the one we opened, the coal is the one we mined, and the machines are the ones we bought with our blood and sweat. On what grounds do you manage the mine? In the past, you rode on our heads and acted tyrannically. Now the times have changed, and we have Chairman Mao to support us. If we listen to you, it's out of the question! If you don't listen to us, you better leave quickly!"

Those people, seeing that force didn't work, tried soft tactics, hypocritically wanting to "cooperate" with us to manage the mine.

Under the banner of "cooperative management," the representatives of the capitalist class secretly colluded with the foremen and mine owners, using every means to counter-restrict. They continued to exploit workers without restrictions and engaged in large-scale speculation. They only cared about making money and did not care about the lives of the workers. In 1954, the state allocated a ventilation machine, but the capitalists, fearing that installing the machine would delay production and reduce profits, chose to leave the machine unused rather than install it, resulting in an accident. All the workers in the mine took action and struggled against the capitalists, exposing the large number of facts where they refused to accept socialist transformation, forcing them to admit their crimes and bow their heads.

Fact after fact proves that the bourgeoisie has never stopped its struggle against the proletariat's restrictions, and we proletariats will never relax our restrictions on them. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are sworn enemies; they will never be in the same pot, thick or thin! The traitor Liu Shaoqi raised the banner of "class cooperation" with the intention of completely betraying the interests of the working class, attempting to let the bourgeoisie control the economic lifeline of the state, allowing capitalism to spread in China, and making New China regress to the dark old society. What kind of "class cooperation" is this? This is "class surrender"!

The old worker Liu Zhenhai, who has worked in the mine for thirty-five years, Zhang Qisheng, who started working in the mine at the age of fourteen, and the old worker Qin Mingyong, who firmly struggled against the capitalists in the early days of liberation and now serves as the deputy director of the revolutionary committee, all indignantly said:

The "theory of class cooperation" is to negate class struggle.

Now it is the era of the working class ruling the country. This country was won by Chairman Mao leading us with guns, not by cooperating with the capitalists. How many of us old miners have crawled out of the hell of the old society. In that era of wolves, we never heard of any capitalist showing kindness and wanting to "cooperate" with us. The traitor Liu Shaoqi has a heart that leans towards the capitalists. He absurdly claims that "we have no historical contradictions with the bourgeoisie" and that "to defeat the capitalists is against the interests of the working class." Liu Shaoqi's words, for whom are they spoken? Isn't it as clear as lice on a bald head? Every word and sentence is defending the capitalists! We workers get angry just hearing it. What "we have no historical contradictions with the bourgeoisie"? His "we" absolutely does not represent our working class. No matter how much he praises the capitalists, singing their praises, even if he blows it up to the sky, it cannot shake our working class's determination to struggle against the capitalists. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." Who doesn't know that capitalists and workers are in a relationship of exploitation and being exploited, oppression and being oppressed. There is no common interest between these two classes. With the freedom of capitalists to exploit, there is no freedom for workers not to be exploited. This is the irreconcilable contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie! The traitor Liu Shaoqi's nonsense about the "unity of interests" between capitalists and workers is pure deception.

The facts of mine owners, foremen, and capitalists ruthlessly exploiting workers tell us: workers can only struggle against capitalists; there is no room for cooperation. We started working for capitalists from a young age. At that time, we were naked, wearing only pants made from sacks, with lamps in our mouths, working thirteen or fourteen hours a day, not knowing where the sun rises or sets! Every day, we crawled in narrow, dark pits, carrying more than thirty loads of coal, each load weighing more than a hundred pounds. Many of our class brothers often coughed up blood from exhaustion. In the eyes of the capitalists, our lives were not worth more than a blade of grass. Once, there was a gas explosion underground, and thirty-six of our class brothers were crushed, burned, and poisoned to death, with not a single one surviving. The mine owners, foremen, and capitalists, however, said, "Four-legged animals are hard to find, but two-legged workers are everywhere. We are not afraid of casualties; we are only afraid of not producing coal." The world is full of crows, and which capitalist does not make a fortune by exploiting our workers' blood and sweat? They will never cooperate with workers. They only exploit and oppress workers.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "class cooperation" cannot cover up the bourgeoisie's history of exploiting the working class, nor can it alter the history of the working class's struggle against the bourgeoisie. In the past, the bourgeoisie oppressed us, and we struggled against them. Now, the bourgeoisie opposes socialism, and we must firmly struggle against them. The traitor Liu Shaoqi attempts to use the fallacy of "class cooperation" to reconcile our contradictions with the capitalists, to confuse the eyes of our working class, to undermine the fighting spirit of our working class, and to make us forget our class bitterness and blood debts, recognizing enemies as friends. This is a pipe dream. If we listen to Liu Shaoqi, it is equivalent to sending ourselves under the capitalists' whip! We old miners, who have scars from whips and bitterness in our stomachs, will never be deceived. The crimes of the capitalists we will remember for a lifetime, speak of for a lifetime, and let our descendants know how cruel and poisonous the capitalists are. Let them always remember: the bourgeoisie cannot cooperate with the proletariat, and the proletariat cannot cooperate with the bourgeoisie!

Old workers Zhang Baohai and Chen Baochun, who have been on the front lines of class struggle for more than a decade, both said:

We must firmly grasp class struggle and never relax.

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the great leader Chairman Mao timely pointed out that "class struggle has not ended" and that "there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system and will struggle against the working class from all sides." His teachings made us realize that although the socialist transformation has been basically completed, class struggle must continue. However, at this critical moment, the traitor Liu Shaoqi once again jumped out, frantically opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He absurdly claimed that "after joint state-private operations, the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have also been resolved" and that "class struggle has basically ended." Sweet words, better than singing! According to him, isn't it that the bourgeoisie has willingly accepted socialist transformation and no longer wants to restore their lost "paradise"? Isn't it that workers and capitalists can manage factories and run enterprises together? Isn't this just old wine in new bottles, selling the same old "theory of class cooperation"? Pfft! Who says that those defeated mine owners, foremen, and capitalists have entered socialism with smiles on their faces? No! They hate that we workers are in power, manage factories, and transform them, hating it to the core! They try soft tactics when hard tactics don't work, determined to restore and rebel. The traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, wants us to put away our swords and horses and let down our guard after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, extinguishing class struggle from our minds and sitting on the same bench with the bourgeoisie. Isn't this just a return to the same old thing, still wanting to engage in "class cooperation," allowing the bourgeoisie to attack the working class, seize power, and return to the stage? This is extremely malicious and reactionary to the core!

For more than a decade, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in our mine have been reciting the "scripture of class struggle extinction" and playing the "game of class cooperation." They awarded the title of "advanced worker" to a counter-revolutionary; they praised a feudal foreman as the "coal master" of the entire mine. They restricted workers from studying Chairman Mao's works actively, using material incentives and money as the standard to corrupt workers. When workers were sick, they ignored them; when capitalists were sick, they personally sent them to the hospital in a small car. Whom do they favor? Whom do they hate? Isn't it clear? What is their ultimate goal in doing all this? Isn't it clear? They are determined to take the capitalist road. Facing the enemy's such fierce attack, how can we have even a hint of "extinction" and "cooperation" in our minds? How can we not firmly grasp class struggle?

The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his "theory of class cooperation" were severely criticized by the old miners, leaving them with no face. The more they criticized, the more everyone hated Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line; the more they criticized, the more everyone loved Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Everyone said: The bitterness and blood debts of several decades, we are clear in our hearts. The bourgeoisie has only struggled against us, never cooperated. If we follow Liu Shaoqi to engage in "class cooperation" with the bourgeoisie and not engage in class struggle, it would allow the bourgeoisie to seize the power of the proletariat without firing a shot, comfortably taking over the proletarian dictatorship. We will not be deceived! We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Never forget class struggle." Against the bourgeoisie and its various agents, we must firmly struggle and never relax, making our country's proletarian dictatorship more and more consolidated.

    无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争决没有熄灭
    ——河北省涿鹿煤矿老工人狠批大工贼刘少奇的“阶级合作论”
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着社会主义革命阶段的开始。在这个新的阶段里，国内的基本矛盾是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，无产阶级必须学会和资产阶级作各种各样的斗争，才能实行并巩固无产阶级专政，走上社会主义道路。但是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇却提出和推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，拚命反对依靠工人阶级，反对对资本主义实行限制和改造，无耻地鼓吹“阶级合作论”，妄图使中国大倒退到半殖民地半封建的老路上去。这是刘少奇对中国人民欠下的一笔债，一定要彻底清算。
    涿鹿煤矿的老工人，用自己几十年来的经历，狠狠批判了大工贼刘少奇的“阶级合作论”。
    祖孙三代给资本家背煤的老工人马占胜和当了几十年矿工的机电连长王光达都说：
    “阶级合作论”的要害是发展资本主义
    全国解放前夕，伟大领袖毛主席告诫全党和全国人民：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，……如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。”正在这个伟大的历史转折关头，大工贼刘少奇跳了出来，露出一副资产阶级代理人的凶相，同毛主席的革命路线相对抗，猖狂地为发展城乡资本主义奔走呼号。他胡说：“中国不是资本主义太多了，而是资本主义太少了”，对资产阶级“不要限制”，要“有饭大家吃，有钱大家赚”。他不许工人阶级对资本家进行斗争，胡说什么资本家“不是我们工人阶级的斗争对象”，竟要工人阶级去跟资本家交“朋友”，搞什么“长期合作”、“完全合作”。
    毛主席指示要利用、限制、改造资本主义，建设社会主义；刘少奇却反对限制、改造，鼓吹依靠资本家，发展资本主义。这是两条根本对立的路线的斗争，关系到我们工人阶级的命运，也关系到中国革命的命运。毛主席的革命路线，代表了工人阶级的根本利益，大长了工人阶级的志气。我们就是认定这一股道往前奔。大工贼刘少奇尽替资本家拨算盘，出点子，撑腰打气。他那条路就象充满毒瓦斯的暗坑道，走进去就要送命葬身，我们工人阶级决不走那条路。
    回想解放以来我们矿的历史，就是这两条道路、两条路线的斗争史。刚解放那会儿，被窑主、把头、资本家盘踞了几十年的矿山回到了人民手里。我们这些“煤黑子”就是有权限制那些身穿大褂子、手提马鞭子的窑主、把头、资本家。一九五○年，煤矿开始了社会主义改造。一场限制和反限制的激烈斗争就展开了。资方代表公开叫嚷工人得服从他的管理，否则，他有权随时解雇工人。我们工人识破了这种阴谋诡计，不买他的账，不受他的骗，团结起来一条心，跟窑主、把头以及资方代表进行针锋相对的斗争。大家义正词严地质问他们：“窑是我们开的，煤是我们采的，机器是我们血汗换的，你们凭什么来管矿？过去你们骑在我们头上横行霸道，现在世道变了，有毛主席给我们撑腰，要听你们的，没门！不听我们的，你们就赶快滚！”
    那些家伙看硬的不行，就来软的，假惺惺地要和我们“合作”管矿。
    资方代表扯起“合作”管矿的幌子，暗地里却和把头、窑主串通一气，想方设法反限制。他们还想继续无限制地剥削工人，并大搞投机倒把活动。他们只顾赚钱，不管工人死活。一九五四年国家拨给一台通风机，资本家却怕安装机器耽误生产少赚钱，宁愿叫机器白搁着也不给安装，结果发生了事故。我们全矿工人行动起来，向资本家进行了斗争，把那些家伙拒不接受社会主义改造的大量事实揭发出来，迫使他们不得不低头认罪。
    一件件、一桩桩的事实证明，资产阶级从来没有停止过对无产阶级的反限制的斗争，我们无产阶级也决不放松对他们的限制。无产阶级和资产阶级是一对冤家对头，啥时候也不会在一个锅里搅稀稠！大工贼刘少奇打出“阶级合作”的旗号来，目的就是要连盘出卖我们工人阶级的利益，妄图让资产阶级把国家经济命脉都“合作”到腰包里去，使资本主义在中国泛滥，使新中国倒退到黑暗的旧社会。这是什么“阶级合作”？这是“阶级投降”！
    在矿上干了三十五年活的老工人刘振海，十四岁就到矿上背煤的张启生，以及解放初期跟资本家进行坚决斗争、现在担任了矿革委会副主任的老工人秦明永都激愤地说：
    “阶级合作论”就是抹杀阶级斗争
    现在是我们工人阶级当家作主的天下。这天下是毛主席他老人家领导我们用枪杆子打出来的，而不是靠与资本家“合作”得来的。我们多少老矿工都是从旧社会的火坑里爬出来的。在那豺狼当道的时代，我们没有一个人听说过哪个资本家发善心，要跟我们搞“合作”。刘少奇这个大工贼一个心眼向着资本家。他胡说什么“我们与资产阶级没有历来的矛盾”，“要打垮资本家是违背工人阶级的利益的”。刘少奇这番话，是替谁讲的，这不是秃子头上的虱子，明摆着的吗？他字字句句都为资本家辩护！我们工人谁听了谁就冒火。什么“我们与资产阶级没有历来的矛盾”？他那个“我们”绝对不能代表我们工人阶级。不管他怎样为资本家搽脂抹粉，歌功颂德，就是吹破了天，也丝毫动摇不了我们工人阶级同资本家斗争的决心。毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”谁不知道资本家跟工人是剥削与被剥削、压迫与被压迫的关系。这两个阶级之间根本没有一致的利益。有资本家剥削的自由，就没有工人不受剥削的自由，这正是工人阶级与资产阶级不可调和的矛盾！大工贼刘少奇鼓吹的资本家和工人利益“一致”的鬼话，纯粹是欺人之谈。
    窑主、把头、资本家残酷剥削工人的事实告诉我们：工人对资本家只能进行斗争，没有合作的余地。我们从小就给资本家背煤。那时我们光着身子，只穿一条麻袋做的裤衩，嘴里衔着灯壶，一天干十三、四个小时的活，不知道日头从那边出，那边落！每天爬在狭窄低暗的井洞里，要背三十多趟煤，每趟一百多斤。许多阶级弟兄累得常常吐血。在资本家眼里，我们工人的命不如一根草。一次，井下发生瓦斯爆炸，三十六个阶级兄弟被活活砸死、烧死、毒死，没有出来一个。窑主、把头、资本家却说什么：“四条腿的牲口难找，两条腿的工人到处都是。不怕出人命，就怕不出煤。”天下乌鸦一般黑，哪一个资本家不是靠压榨我们工人的血汗发家的。他们根本不会跟工人搞什么“合作”。他们对工人，除了剥削还是剥削，除了压迫还是压迫。
    大工贼刘少奇再鼓吹“阶级合作”也掩盖不了资产阶级对工人阶级剥削的罪恶史，也篡改不了工人阶级跟资产阶级的斗争史。过去资产阶级压迫我们，我们跟他们斗争。现在资产阶级反对社会主义，我们也要坚决跟他们斗争。大工贼刘少奇妄图用“阶级合作”的谬论调和我们同资本家的矛盾，迷住我们工人阶级的眼睛，瓦解我们工人阶级的斗志，妄想要我们忘掉阶级苦、血泪仇，认敌为友，这是白日做梦。如果听了刘少奇的话，就等于把身子往资本家的鞭子底下送！我们这些身有鞭痕、肚有苦水的老矿工，决不会上当受骗。资本家的罪恶我们要记一辈子，讲一辈子，让子孙后代都知道资本家有多狠，有多毒。让他们永远记住：资产阶级不能跟无产阶级合作，无产阶级也不能跟资产阶级搞合作！
    十几年来一直站在阶级斗争第一线的老工人张宝海、陈宝纯都说：
    一定要狠抓阶级斗争不松劲
    在生产资料所有制社会主义改造基本完成以后，伟大领袖毛主席及时地指出“阶级斗争并没有结束”，“社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争”。他老人家的教导使我们认识到，尽管社会主义改造基本完成了，阶级斗争还必须继续进行。但是就在这个节骨眼上，大工贼刘少奇又一次跳出来疯狂反对毛主席的革命路线。他胡说什么“公私合营了，无产阶级与资产阶级的矛盾也解决了”，“阶级斗争基本结束”了。花言巧语，说的比唱的还好听！照他这么说，岂不是资产阶级已经心甘情愿接受社会主义改造，再也不想恢复他们失去的“天堂”了吗？岂不是工人和资本家可以一起管工厂，一起办企业了吗？这不是新瓶装老酒，卖的还是他那套“阶级合作论”的破烂货吗？呸！谁说那伙被打倒的窑主、把头、资本家眉开眼笑地进入社会主义了？不！他们对我们工人阶级掌权、管工厂，对他们实行改造，恨得咬牙根！他们硬的不行来软的，一心只想复辟翻天。大工贼刘少奇却想叫我们在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，“刀枪入库，马放南山”，从思想上把阶级斗争“熄灭”掉，跟资产阶级坐到一条板凳上去。这不是九九归一，还想搞什么“阶级合作”，让资产阶级向我们工人阶级进攻，夺取政权，重新上台吗？真是恶毒之极，反动透顶！
    十多年来，大工贼刘少奇及其在我们矿上的代理人，念的就是“阶级斗争熄灭论”这本修字经，搞的就是“阶级合作”这套鬼把戏。他们把一个反革命分子封为“先进工作者”；把一个封建把头捧成全矿的“煤师”。 他们限制工人活学活用毛主席著作，用物质刺激、金钱挂帅等“软刀子”腐蚀工人。工人生病，他们不睬不管；资本家有病，他们用小卧车亲自送进医院。他们对谁亲？对谁恨？不是明明白白的吗？他们搞这一套，目的究竟何在，不也是明明白白的吗？他们就是千方百计要走资本主义道路。面对着敌人这样猖狂的进攻，我们思想上怎能掺得半点儿“熄灭”、“合作”的念头？我们怎能不狠狠地大抓阶级斗争？
    大工贼刘少奇和他的“阶级合作论”被老矿工们批得体无完肤。越批，大家对刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线越仇恨；越批，大家对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越热爱。大伙都说：几十年的阶级苦、血泪仇，我们心眼里一清二楚。资产阶级从来对我们只有斗争，没有合作。若是跟着刘少奇去和资产阶级搞什么“阶级合作”，不搞阶级斗争，那就会让资产阶级不费一枪一弹，舒舒服服地夺了无产阶级的权，专了无产阶级的政。我们决不上当！我们要听毛主席他老人家的教导：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。对于资产阶级和它的形形色色的代理人，我们就是要坚决斗争不松劲，使我国的无产阶级专政越来越巩固。
