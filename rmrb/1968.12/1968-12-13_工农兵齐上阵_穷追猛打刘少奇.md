Continuing to deepen the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminating the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the clique of the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, is a great and glorious combat task facing the broad revolutionary masses. Under the inspiration of the communiqué, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are charging into battle, bravely taking to the revolutionary criticism battlefield, thoroughly settling accounts with Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' treasonous crimes against the Party and the nation.

It should be recognized that not everyone has a sufficient understanding of revolutionary criticism. Some people think, "Since Liu Shaoqi has been expelled from the Party and removed from office, everything is fine." This is a very muddled notion, reflecting the lingering poison of the theory of the extinction of class struggle. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Great Lenin also said: "When the old society is dying, its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried in a grave. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us." Although this big scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has been permanently expelled from the Party and removed from office, the reactionary revisionist thoughts he has peddled for a long time in various fields and on various fronts have deep roots and widespread poison, constantly emitting a foul odor to poison us. We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of beating a fallen dog, and in various fields and on various fronts carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, eliminating all its poison.

To carry out revolutionary criticism, it is necessary to mobilize the masses broadly and deeply, with everyone speaking out and writing. However, in some departments, the masses have not been mobilized broadly and deeply enough, and there is a phenomenon of relying on a few people. They are satisfied with posting some big-character posters and holding a few criticism meetings, which seem lively on the surface but in reality rely on "eloquence" for speeches and "scholars" for writing big-character posters. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can the war be carried out, and only by relying on the people can the war be carried out." The great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi is a sinister figure who has committed countless crimes as a running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang. He is the ringleader of the reactionary revisionist clique and the representative of the forces aiming to restore capitalism. He has held key positions within the Party for over forty years, and his poison is very deep and widespread. Therefore, criticizing Liu Shaoqi must be a "people's war," breaking the pattern where "scholars" handle criticism and "commoners" handle production. Both "commoners" and "scholars" must take to the battlefield, speaking out and writing, relentlessly pursuing and attacking. Only in this way can the revolutionary criticism advance step by step, burying Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in the vast ocean of the people's war, making them rats that everyone wants to beat, and ensuring that their reactionary revisionist thoughts are criticized and stink forever!

Comrade Lin Biao says: "Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism." We carry out revolutionary criticism precisely to rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With this powerful ideological weapon, our minds are clear, our eyes are bright, our stance is firm, and our banner is clear. Therefore, in carrying out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism movement, we must raise the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level, learning in struggle, using in struggle, learning in criticism, and using in criticism. Using the red arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the black target of the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, push the revolutionary criticism to a deeper stage, complete the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    工农兵齐上阵　穷追猛打刘少奇
    继续深入开展革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，这是摆在广大革命人民面前一项极其伟大的光荣的战斗任务。广大工农兵群众在公报鼓舞下，冲锋陷阵，勇敢地杀上革命大批判的战场，彻底清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行。
    应该看到，对于革命大批判，并不是所有的人都有足够的认识。有些人认为，“刘少奇既已清除出党，又罢了官，就万事大吉了。”这是非常糊涂的观念，是“阶级斗争熄灭论”的流毒没有完全肃清的反映。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”伟大的列宁也曾说过：“旧社会灭亡的时候，它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。”刘少奇这个大坏蛋，虽然被永远开除出党，并被罢了官，但是他长期以来在各个领域、各条战线所贩卖的反革命修正主义思想，根子很深，流毒甚广，不时地散发着臭气来毒害我们。我们必须奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，发扬痛打落水狗的精神，在各个领域、各条战线上开展深入持久的革命大批判，肃清其一切流毒。
    开展革命大批判，必须广泛深入地发动群众，人人口诛笔伐。但是，在个别部门中，群众发动得还不够广泛深入，存在着只依靠少数人的现象。他们满足于贴了一些大字报，开了几次批判大会，表面上看起来轰轰烈烈，实际则是发言靠“口才”，写大字报靠“秀才”。毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，是反革命修正主义集团的总头目，是资本主义复辟势力的总代表。他在党内窃据要职四十多年，流毒非常深广。因此，批判刘少奇必须“全民皆兵”，打“人民战争”，要打破那种“秀才”搞批判，“老粗”搞生产的局面。要“老粗”“秀才”齐上阵，人人口诛笔伐，穷追猛打。只有这样，革命大批判才能步步深入，才能把刘少奇及其同伙埋葬在“人民战争”的汪洋大海中，成为人人喊打的过街老鼠，才能把他的反革命修正主义思想批得遗臭万年！
    林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。”我们进行革命大批判，就是要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们掌握了毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，心就明，眼就亮，立场就坚定，旗帜就鲜明。因此，我们在开展深入持久的革命大批判运动中，必须把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动提高到一个新的水平，在斗争中学，斗争中用，在批判中学，批判中用。用毛泽东思想的红箭，去射中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇及其同伙这个黑靶。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把革命大批判推向更加深入的阶段，完成伟大的斗、批、改任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
