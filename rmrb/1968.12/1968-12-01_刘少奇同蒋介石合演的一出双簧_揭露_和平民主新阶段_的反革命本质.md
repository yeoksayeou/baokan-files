In early 1946, Liu Shaoqi issued a report titled "The Issue of the Current Situation," also known as the "Peaceful Democratic New Stage." This was Liu Shaoqi's major betrayal of the Chinese revolution. This counterrevolutionary manifesto clearly indicated that Liu Shaoqi was promoting a pure Kuomintang line, a line aimed at selling out China to American imperialism; this counterrevolutionary manifesto clearly indicated that Liu Shaoqi was a faithful running dog of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, a traitor hiding within the Party.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, on the eve of the final victory in the anti-Fascist war, presided over the historic Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China and wisely pointed out: "Before the Chinese people, there are two paths: the path of light and the path of darkness. There are two destinies for China: the destiny of a bright China and the destiny of a dark China. ... Even if we defeat Japanese imperialism, there are still these two futures. Either an independent, free, democratic, unified, and strong China, that is, a new China where the Chinese people are liberated; or another China, a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, divided, and weak China, that is, an old China." The congress unanimously adopted Chairman Mao's line of mobilizing the masses, expanding the people's forces, and, under the leadership of our Party, defeating the invaders and building a new China. The historical process after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan fully proved that Chairman Mao's scientific analysis and political line were completely correct.

After the Second World War, American imperialism in China intensified its policy of supporting Chiang Kai-shek and suppressing communists, using "mediation" of the Chinese civil war as a cover, and vigorously supporting Chiang Kai-shek in all aspects, hoping to suppress the Chinese revolutionary forces, which had grown strong during the War of Resistance against Japan, through Chiang Kai-shek's policy of massacre, and turn China into its colony in reality.

Chiang Kai-shek, who had been hiding on Mount Emei for eight years, adopting the counterrevolutionary policy of "sitting on the sidelines, waiting for victory, preserving strength, and preparing for civil war," saw that the people had defeated the Japanese invaders through bloody struggle. He wanted to come down the mountain to pick the "peaches," to seize the fruits of victory. On the one hand, he released the smoke screen of "peaceful nation-building"; on the other hand, with the support of American imperialism, he sharpened his knives, preparing to launch a large-scale anti-communist, anti-people civil war.

Our great leader Chairman Mao had long pointed out the ambition of American imperialism to monopolize China and Chiang Kai-shek's counterrevolutionary policy of insisting on dictatorship and civil war, and called on the entire Party and the people of the whole country to pay serious attention. As soon as Japan announced its surrender, Chairman Mao wisely and timely pointed out: "The situation in China has developed into a new period. There is a transitional stage between the new period and the period of the War of Resistance against Japan. The struggle in the transitional stage is the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to seize the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance against Japan. Chiang Kai-shek wants to launch a nationwide civil war, his policy has been decided, we must be prepared for this." "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost, they must be defended by struggle." He personally formulated the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary policy of "fighting back tooth and nail, inch by inch."

At this time, the faithful running dog of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, Liu Shaoqi, in order to cooperate with the so-called "mediation" needs of American imperialism and the "peace" smoke screen of Chiang Kai-shek, issued the "Peaceful Democratic New Stage" black report, attempting to help his master Chiang Kai-shek seize the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance against Japan without firing a single shot, eliminate the Communist Party, disintegrate the People's Liberation Army, annex the liberated areas, and unify China under the fascist rule of the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, becoming a colony of American imperialism.

At that time, the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, with the direct help of American imperialism, shouted about "military and political orders must be unified," vigorously mobilizing all forces, deploying troops, and continuously attacking the liberated areas, and was about to launch a full-scale attack on the liberated areas. A nationwide civil war already existed. Liu Shaoqi, however, maliciously shouted that the "Peaceful Democratic New Stage" had arrived, and it was not "about to begin," but had "definitely begun."

Why did Liu Shaoqi jump out at this time, distort right and wrong, and vigorously propagandize the counterrevolutionary fallacy of the "Peaceful Democratic New Stage"?

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to preserve his strength, placed his main forces far from the battlefield in the deep rear. After Japan's surrender, he did not have time to transport his troops to the civil war front, and he was also worried that the troops that had already begun to attack the liberated areas would be eaten up by the people's armed forces. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek needed to play these tricks to buy time and complete his preparations for civil war. By the end of June 1946, Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, believed that their preparations for launching a full-scale civil war were complete and immediately launched an unprecedented large-scale civil war.

This great traitor Liu Shaoqi worked so hard for Chiang Kai-shek's delaying tactics, creating a counterrevolutionary public opinion that the "Peaceful Democratic New Stage" had arrived. His evil purpose was to make our Party, our army, and the people of the whole country lose vigilance against the Kuomintang's launch of a nationwide civil war, to disintegrate the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people, to disarm the revolutionary people spiritually, and to create favorable conditions for Chiang Kai-shek to launch a full-scale civil war.

Of course, Liu Shaoqi was dreaming. The Chinese people did not fall for it. Our great leader Chairman Mao had long pointed out: "If there is opportunism in this period, it is not to strive for it, but to voluntarily hand over the fruits that the people should have to Chiang Kai-shek." "Now Chiang Kai-shek is sharpening his knives, so we must also sharpen our knives." Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people remained highly vigilant against Chiang Kai-shek's plot for civil war. When Chiang Kai-shek, under the orders of American imperialism, launched a nationwide anti-communist, anti-people civil war, we had already completed all preparations and stood in an invincible position. Under the personal command of the wise leader Chairman Mao, after more than three years of heroic fighting, we thoroughly defeated the running dog of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, liberated all the territory except Taiwan Province, and established a state power of people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of state power. "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing state power and consolidating state power. And the counterrevolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is completely for maintaining their state power."

Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary manifesto "Peaceful Democratic New Stage" did everything possible to maintain the Kuomintang's dictatorship and attempted to help Chiang Kai-shek annex the people's power in the liberated areas.

Let's first see how Liu Shaoqi maintained the Kuomintang's reactionary regime.

Everyone knows that the fundamental task of the Chinese democratic revolution is: externally, to smash imperialist aggression and expel imperialist aggression in China; internally, to overthrow the Kuomintang's fascist rule, abolish the feudal system of exploitation, and enable the broad masses of laboring people to achieve liberation and emancipation. In short, it is to overthrow the three big mountains on the heads of the Chinese people.

Liu Shaoqi, however, said: "The so-called basic victory of the democratic revolution is through a constitution, and on the basis of this constitution, a parliamentary system is established." Liu Shaoqi's so-called basic victory of the democratic revolution does not touch a single hair of the reactionary rule of the US-Chiang clique, and the broad masses of laboring people are still under the cruel exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class. This self-proclaimed "theorist" completely tore off the cloak of a communist, nakedly opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and revealed the true colors of a faithful running dog of the bourgeoisie.

Liu Shaoqi did not mention the fundamental tasks of opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, nor did he mention the most fundamental issue of the revolution, the seizure of power. His purpose was to maintain Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and to use the "constitution" and "parliament" and other bourgeois democratic tricks to deceive the people, cancel the revolution.

Let's see how Liu Shaoqi attempted to hand over the people's power in the liberated areas to Chiang Kai-shek.

Liu Shaoqi was in a hurry to dress up and send himself to the door, saying, "Some of us are going to be officials," "from the central government to the district government, we all have to be officials." What was the exchange condition? Liu Shaoqi immediately said: "If we participate in their government, will their government come to us?" "They will come." Just five words, he revealed the black hearts of him and his master. According to Liu Shaoqi's revelation, the Kuomintang wanted to go to the liberated areas to "publish newspapers, establish news agencies, set up party branches, and even participate in our government," and so on. Liu Shaoqi's confession exposed the conspiracy and trickery of his master, the American imperialists, and the Kuomintang bandits, who wanted to borrow the pretext of sending a few Communists to Nanjing to "be officials" to occupy the entire liberated area without firing a shot. It turned out that sending Communist Party members to the Kuomintang government to "be officials" was a trick, while the Kuomintang wanted to restore their reactionary rule in the liberated areas and ride on the heads of the people again. How sinister their intentions were!

In order to realize the conspiracy of his master, Liu Shaoqi vigorously advocated the "parliamentary struggle" path, crazily shouting that the Party must "shift from armed struggle as the main form to non-armed political struggle." "The Party's entire work must be reorganized and transformed." At the same time, Liu Shaoqi greatly deceived the people, forcibly turning the $20 billion that American imperialism helped Chiang Kai-shek to carry out anti-people civil war into something for "opening factories and economic construction," vigorously beautifying his master, American imperialism, and attempting to lure people into the trap.

All these were in vain. Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people always maintained a clear mind, did not believe the "good words" of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, knowing that the enemy would not have a change of heart; nor were they afraid of the enemy's threats. The established people's power was the lifeblood of the laboring people and must not be lost, it must be defended by struggle. Against the invading enemy, it must be resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and absolutely annihilated.

With "granting official positions" and "giving money," Liu Shaoqi used these two things as bait, everywhere persuading Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers. What did he want to exchange for? It turned out that he was following the orders of his master, American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, to hand over the people's army to Chiang Kai-shek. This ten-thousand-times traitor was destroying the revolution in this way.

Our great leader Chairman Mao summed up the experience of revolutionary struggle and pointed out profoundly: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing of the people." "From the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism on the state, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a powerful army."

Chiang Kai-shek, this great warlord, deeply understood the principle of "having an army means having power." His counterrevolutionary life was on the one hand tightly holding the Kuomintang's gun barrel and on the other hand always trying to eliminate the armed forces led by our Party. After Japan's surrender, he used all kinds of tricks to try to realize his ambition to swallow up our army. Until the closing meeting of the old Political Consultative Conference, Chiang Kai-shek still shouted, "The most urgent task at present is to make all the armed forces in the country, regardless of party affiliation and region, obey the command of the government." Otherwise, participating in the government would be "meaningless," and peace and unity would have "no foundation." It was very clear that Chiang Kai-shek wanted to swallow up the people's armed forces in one gulp.

The great traitor Liu Shaoqi, seeing his master Chiang Kai-shek's anxious mood on the issue of armed forces, wanted to take the opportunity to perform meritorious service and help Chiang Kai-shek obtain what he had not obtained on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. He, together with American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, sang in unison, crazily shouting to turn our Party-led armed forces into "national army, national defense army, self-defense army, unified under the unified command of the Kuomintang Ministry of Defense." And even more blatantly, he wanted to abolish all the "branch, general branch, party affairs committee, political commissar" of our Party in the army in exchange for the so-called "legal" position. He even shamelessly proposed the counterrevolutionary slogan of "conceding on the army, making great progress nationwide," openly standing on the Kuomintang's position, saying that "not conceding is not an option," "not conceding," "the civil war would be unstoppable, China would be divided, and national democratization would be impossible, so this concession must be made." Look! The soul of this great traitor, great spy, and great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi was so despicable and shameless! He completely stood on the side of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, reversing right and wrong, blaming our Party for Chiang Kai-shek's launch of the anti-people civil war; confusing black and white, blaming the people for the Kuomintang's dictatorship. This is intolerable!

The Chinese people, from their own personal experiences, deeply understand the importance of the gun barrel. The people's gun barrel is the reliance of the laboring people to turn over and seek liberation; it is the lifeblood of the laboring people. The army is the fundamental element of state power. Without the gun barrel, seizing state power is just an empty talk; without the gun barrel, the people's power in the liberated areas would not be able to exist for even one day. The people's armed forces, which the Chinese people exchanged with the blood of countless martyrs, how could they be easily handed over? "The people's armed forces, a gun, a bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." Our great leader Chairman Mao, representing the will of the people of the whole country, gave an ironclad answer.

"The gun barrel produces state power," this is the summary of the entire experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary history. It is precisely because of the gun barrel that we defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialism and fought for a socialist state.

The "Peaceful Democratic New Stage" is a counterexample, a confession of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and the script of a double act performed by Liu Shaoqi on stage and Chiang Kai-shek behind the scenes. The play is long over, but the counterrevolutionary two-faced Liu Shaoqi repeatedly changed his masks and performed one ugly farce after another until this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when this great traitor, great spy, and great scoundrel was finally exposed and, together with his master Chiang Kai-shek, was swept into the garbage heap of history. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, this is the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    刘少奇同蒋介石合演的一出双簧
    ——揭露“和平民主新阶段”的反革命本质
    中国人民解放军高等军事学院　红学兵
    一九四六年初，刘少奇抛出一篇《时局问题的报告》，即“和平民主新阶段”。这是刘少奇对中国革命的一次大叛卖。这篇反革命檄文，非常清楚地表明，刘少奇推行的是一条地地道道的国民党路线，是一条妄图把中国出卖给美帝国主义的亡国路线；这篇反革命檄文，非常清楚地表明，刘少奇是美帝国主义和蒋介石的忠实走狗，是隐藏在党内的大内奸。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在反法西斯战争最后胜利的前夜，在亲自主持召开的具有伟大历史意义的中国共产党第七次全国代表大会上英明地指出：“在中国人民面前摆着两条路，光明的路和黑暗的路。有两种中国之命运，光明的中国之命运和黑暗的中国之命运。……即使把日本帝国主义打败了，也还是有这样两个前途。或者是一个独立、自由、民主、统一、富强的中国，就是说，光明的中国，中国人民得到解放的新中国；或者是另一个中国，半殖民地半封建的、分裂的、贫弱的中国，就是说，一个老中国。”大会一致通过了毛主席制定的放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我们党的领导下，打败侵略者，建设新中国的路线。抗日战争胜利后的历史进程，充分证明了毛主席的科学分析和政治路线是完全正确的。
    第二次世界大战之后，美帝国主义在中国变本加厉地推行扶蒋反共政策，以“调解”中国内战为掩护，极力从各方面扶植蒋介石，幻想通过蒋介石的屠杀政策，把在抗日战争中发展壮大起来的中国革命力量打下去，使中国实际上变为它的殖民地。
    那个躲在峨眉山上八年，采取“袖手旁观，等待胜利，保存实力，准备内战”的反革命方针的蒋介石，看到人民经过浴血奋战已经打败了日本侵略者，他要下山摘“桃子”，抢夺胜利果实了。他一方面施放“和平建国”的烟幕；一方面在美帝国主义支持下，磨刀霍霍，准备发动一场大规模的反共反人民的内战。
    伟大领袖毛主席对美帝国主义妄图独霸中国的野心和蒋介石坚持独裁内战的反革命方针，早就指出来，要全党和全国人民严重注意。日本帝国主义刚宣布投降，毛主席英明地、及时地指出：“中国的时局发展到了一个新的时期。新时期和抗日战争时期之间有一个过渡阶段。过渡阶段的斗争，就是反对蒋介石篡夺抗战胜利果实的斗争。蒋介石要发动全国规模的内战，他的方针已经定了，我们对此要有准备。”“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”并且亲自制定了“针锋相对，寸土必争”的马克思列宁主义的革命方针。
    就在这个时候，美帝国主义和蒋介石的忠实走狗刘少奇，为了配合美帝国主义的所谓“调解”的需要，为了配合蒋介石的“和平”烟幕，抛出了“和平民主新阶段”这篇黑报告，妄图帮助他的主子蒋介石不费一枪一弹，攫取抗战胜利果实，消灭共产党，瓦解人民解放军，吞并解放区，把中国统一在人民公敌蒋介石的法西斯统治之下，成为美帝国主义的殖民地。
    当时，人民公敌蒋介石在美帝国主义直接帮助之下，叫嚣什么“军令政令必须统一”，极力动员一切力量，大肆调兵遣将，不断进攻解放区，即将向解放区发动全面进攻，全国规模的内战已经存在。刘少奇却别有用心地高叫“和平民主新阶段”已经到来，而且“不是即将开始”，是“确定地已经开始了”。
    刘少奇为什么在这个时候跳出来，颠倒黑白，大肆宣扬“和平民主新阶段”的反革命谬论？
    在抗日战争中，蒋介石为了保存实力，把他的主力部队都摆在远离战场的大后方。日本投降了，他来不及把部队运到内战前线，又担心已经开始向解放区进攻的部队，被人民武装一口一口地吃掉。所以，蒋介石需要玩弄这些花招，以争取时间，完成他进行内战的准备工作。到一九四六年六月底，蒋介石及其主子美帝国主义认为他们发动全面内战的准备工作已经完成，马上发动了空前规模的大内战。
    刘少奇这个大内奸，如此卖力地为蒋介石的缓兵计效劳，大造“和平民主新阶段”已经到来的反革命舆论，其罪恶目的，就是为了使我党我军和全国人民失去对国民党发动全国规模内战的警觉，替国民党反动派瓦解革命人民的斗志，使革命人民从精神上解除武装，给蒋介石发动全面内战创造有利条件。
    当然，刘少奇这是白日作梦，中国人民并没有上当。伟大领袖毛主席早已指出：“这个时期如果有机会主义的话，那就是不力争，自愿地把人民应得的果实送给蒋介石。”指出“现在蒋介石已经在磨刀了，因此，我们也要磨刀。”中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席教导下，对蒋介石的内战阴谋，保持了高度的警惕。当蒋介石在美帝国主义指使下，发动全国规模的反共反人民内战的时候，我们早已完成了各方面的准备工作，而立于不败之地了。中国人民在英明统帅毛主席的亲自指挥下，经过三年多的英勇作战，彻底打败了美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石，解放了除台湾省以外的全部国土，建立了无产阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家政权。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    刘少奇这篇“和平民主新阶段”反革命檄文千方百计地保持国民党的独裁统治，并且妄图帮助蒋介石吞并解放区的人民政权。
    我们先看看刘少奇是怎样维护国民党反动政权的。
    大家都知道，中国民主革命的根本任务在于：对外，粉碎帝国主义的侵略，驱逐帝国主义在中国的侵略势力；对内，推翻国民党的法西斯统治，废除封建剥削制度，使广大劳动人民求得翻身解放。一句话，就是推翻压在中国人民头上的三座大山。
    刘少奇却说：“所谓民主革命的基本胜利是通过一个宪法，而且根据这个宪法建立议会制度”。刘少奇的所谓民主革命的基本胜利，根本不触动美蒋反动统治的一根毫毛，而广大劳动人民依然是处于反动统治阶级的残酷剥削和奴役之下。这位自封的“理论家”完全撕掉了共产主义者的外衣，赤裸裸地反对无产阶级专政，从而现出了资产阶级忠实走狗的原形。
    刘少奇闭口不谈反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义这些根本的任务，闭口不谈夺取政权这个革命的最根本的问题，其目的就是为了维护蒋介石的反动统治，并使这个反动政权用“宪法”和“议会”等资产阶级民主制那一套骗人的玩意儿装饰起来，麻醉人民，取消革命。
    我们再看看刘少奇是怎样妄图把解放区的人民政权拱手送给蒋介石的。
    刘少奇急着要梳装打扮，送上门去，说“我们有些人要去做官了”，“自中央政府至区政府里都得去做官。”拿什么做交换条件呢？紧接着刘少奇说：“我们参加他们的政府，那么我们的政府他们是不是会来呢？”“他们会来的。”只五个字，全盘托出了他和他主子的黑心。根据刘少奇的透露，国民党要到解放区“办报纸、办通讯社、设立党部，以致参加我们的政府”等等。刘少奇这一番自白，把他主子美帝、蒋匪妄图假借要我党派几个人到南京去“做官”，以便不费一兵一卒占领整个解放区的阴谋诡计，暴露无遗了。原来让共产党人到国民党政府去“做官”是假，而国民党要到解放区复辟他们的反动统治、重新骑在人民头上是真。其用心何其毒也。
    刘少奇为了实现其主子的阴谋计划，极力宣扬“议会斗争”道路，丧心病狂地叫喊党必须“从武装斗争为主转变到非武装的政治斗争。”“党的全部工作要实行改组，实行转变。”与此同时，刘少奇大肆欺骗人民，硬把美帝国主义帮助蒋介石进行反人民内战的二十亿美元，说成是什么为了“开工厂，办经济建设”，极力美化其主子美帝国主义，妄图引诱人们去上当。
    这些都是枉费心机的。中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的教导下，始终保持了清醒的头脑，不相信美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的“好话”，知道敌人是不会发善心的；也不怕敌人的恐吓。已经建立起来的人民政权，是劳动人民的命根子，绝不能丢掉，必须用战斗来保卫。对于来犯的敌人，一定坚决彻底干净全部地消灭之。
    又是“封官”，又是“给钱”，刘少奇拿这两件东西作钓饵，到处向共产党人和革命战士游说，他要换取什么东西呢？原来他是听命于他的主子美帝国主义和蒋介石，要把人民军队交给蒋介石。这个十恶不赦的内奸，就是这样破坏革命的。
    伟大领袖毛主席总结了革命斗争的经验，深刻地指出：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”
    蒋介石这个大军阀，深知“有军则有权”的原则。他的反革命一生，一方面紧紧抓住国民党的枪杆子不放，另一方面总是千方百计地想消灭我党领导的人民武装力量。日本投降后，他耍尽了种种花招，妄图实现吞掉我军的野心。直到旧政协闭幕会议上，蒋介石还大叫，“当前最急要的任务就是要使全国所有军队，不分党派，不分地区，听命于政府的指挥。”不然的话，参加政府就“没有意义”，和平和团结“也没有基础”。很清楚，蒋介石就是想要把人民的武装力量一口吞掉。
    大工贼刘少奇，看着他主子蒋介石在武装力量问题上的焦急心情，想趁机立下汗马功劳，帮助蒋介石取得在战场上和会议桌上都没有得到的东西。他和美帝国主义、国民党反动派一唱一和，疯狂地叫嚣要把我党领导的武装力量“变成国军、国防军、自卫军，统一在国民党国防部的统一指挥之下。”并且比国民党更加露骨地要把“我们党在军队里头的支部、总支、党务委员会、政治委员”通通取消，以换取所谓“合法”地位。甚至明目张胆地提出“军队让一步，全国大进步”的反革命口号，公开站在国民党的立场上，说什么“不让步不行”，“不让步”，“内战就无从制止，中国就要分裂，全国民主化就不可能，所以这个让步是非让不可的。”看！刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼的灵魂卑鄙无耻到何种程度！他完全站在美帝蒋匪一边，把蒋介石发动的反人民内战，颠倒是非，嫁祸于我党；把国民党的独裁统治，混淆黑白，归罪于人民。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    中国人民从自己的切身经历中，深深地懂得枪杆子的重要性。人民的枪杆子，是劳动人民闹翻身、求解放的依靠，是劳动人民的命根子。军队是政权的根本要素，没有枪杆子，夺取政权，只是一句空话；没有枪杆子，解放区的人民政权，就连一天也存在不下去。中国人民用无数烈士的鲜血换得来的人民武装力量，怎么能够轻易交出去呢？“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”伟大领袖毛主席代表全国人民的意志，做了斩钉截铁的回答。
    “枪杆子里面出政权”，这是中国人民革命历史全部经验的总结。我们正是依靠枪杆子，打败了在美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石反动派，打出了一个社会主义江山。
    “和平民主新阶段”这篇反面教材，是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的自白书，是刘少奇在台前、蒋介石在台后合演的一出双簧戏的台词。戏是早已结束了，但反革命两面派刘少奇一再变换脸谱，又串演了一场场的丑剧，直到这次无产阶级文化大革命中，才把这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼揪了出来，并把他和他的主子蒋介石一样，扫进了历史垃圾堆。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
