Rural Youth Must Be Re-educated by Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

From the Perspective of the Two-Line Struggle: The Necessity of Re-educating Rural Youth

Since 1964, the Dushita Commune in Liaoning Province's Xinjin County has accepted 224 rural youth from Dalian City. Before going to the countryside, the revisionist education line promoted by the number one capitalist roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, had left a bourgeois stamp on the minds of these young people, emphasizing "fame and fortune" and "looking down on workers and peasants." Liu Shaoqi advocated that youth with "culture" should go to the countryside to "work the land for three to five years," and by "getting along well with the masses," they could strive to become "village, county, or provincial cadres." This blueprint for "officialdom" designed by the chief representative of the capitalist restoration forces followed these rural youth like a ghost when they went to the countryside. In the Pengdun Production Brigade, one rural youth was told in middle school that he had the "natural qualities of a professional athlete" and had "great prospects for fame and fortune." After going to the countryside, he always felt that working as a farmer was like using an anti-aircraft gun to shoot a mosquito—overqualified. He planned to work the land for a few years to "qualify as a farmer," then go to apply for the Sports Academy, become a professional athlete, and break national records, which would make his future "bright." After a few years in the countryside, his dream of fame and fortune did not come true, so he started causing trouble and wanted to return to the city. During the Cultural Revolution, he accepted re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Mao Zedong Thought diligently, and became an active promoter of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the county.

Regarding the issue of rural youth going to the mountains and countryside to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were terrified. When they still held some leadership positions, they did everything they could to obstruct and sabotage this. They accused the poor and lower-middle peasants of "improper placement and poor care" of rural youth, saying that rural youth needed "centralized housing, separate labor, and lighter work." They even absurdly claimed that rural youth were "new-style peasants," while the poor and lower-middle peasants were "old-style peasants," and that "new and old peasants should not mix," to prevent "new-style peasants" from changing their nature and "type." Following this, they built so-called "youth points," making rural youth "labor separately" and "manage themselves." Thus, rural youth, who had just broken out of the deep courtyards of "old schools," were again locked into the deep courtyards of the brigade's "youth points." A rural youth in the Yangdun Production Brigade had been in the countryside for three years but had only been to one poor peasant's home, and that was just to get water to drink. The poor and lower-middle peasants said painfully, "These young people live in our village but don't come into our homes or recognize us!" Before the Cultural Revolution, the Tuchengzi Production Brigade had sent poor and lower-middle peasants to the "youth points" to hold Mao Zedong Thought schools six times, but each time they were obstructed and failed.

In the countryside, untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists also desperately sabotaged the integration of rural youth with workers and peasants. They exploited the lack of political experience and the "selfish" weaknesses in the minds of rural youth, corrupting and deceiving them, trying to pull them into the capitalist quagmire.

People clearly saw: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie were like two teams in a tug-of-war, fighting over the youth. Re-educating rural youth by the poor and lower-middle peasants is a necessity of class struggle, a necessity for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and a necessity for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Grasp the Power of Educating Rural Youth

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. In the matter of re-educating rural youth, the same issue of who holds the leadership power arises. The experience of Dushita Commune shows that re-educating rural youth by the poor and lower-middle peasants is a matter of struggle and resistance. The class enemies instigated, saying, "Scholars are not as good as farmers; going to the countryside to farm is still being bullied by farmers." Some rural youth deeply poisoned by the revisionist education line said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants are uneducated and rustic; what can they teach?" A few poor and lower-middle peasants also thought, "Rural youth are eloquent and have a full set of theories; we can't educate them." Therefore, the commune revolutionary committee and the PLA propaganda team for promoting Mao Zedong Thought believed that to do a good job of re-educating rural youth, they must grasp the ideological leadership in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They organized poor and lower-middle peasants and rural youth throughout the commune to deeply study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution and related teachings on the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants. They criticized the reactionary fallacies of "all professions are lowly, only reading is noble" and "those who labor with their minds rule others, those who labor with their strength are ruled by others." They criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of peasant backwardness" and the bourgeois ideology of looking down on workers and peasants and lightening practical work. Many rural youth indignantly said, "The old education system poured fame and profit into our heads but didn't talk about revolution. After studying for eight or nine years, we only know math, physics, and chemistry, but we don't understand enemies, friends, and ourselves." Through the revolutionary criticism, rural youth realized that whether or not to accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants was a major issue of standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or the bourgeois reactionary line, of becoming successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause or bourgeois successors. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants further realized that re-educating rural youth was a glorious task given by the great leader Chairman Mao and a fundamental strategy to ensure that our country remains red for thousands of generations.

On this basis, the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural youth, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing," broke the regulations imposed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi's agents in Liaoning and Xinjin, which stipulated that rural youth should "build points in brigades, labor separately, and manage themselves." At the same time, they corrected the phenomenon of "assigning people to households and treating them equally with community members," neglecting re-education. Everyone agreed that rural youth laboring separately and managing themselves could not "connect with the poor and lower-middle peasants, have no bones to hang on," and that such "youth points" did not allow the poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp the power of re-education, and the proletariat did not occupy the ideological battlefield, allowing bourgeois ideology to spread freely. The poor and lower-middle peasants and rural youth jointly researched and agreed that the best method was to: build the points in production brigades or "build points in brigades and insert teams collectively," that is, insert teams of about ten people into the production brigades. The advantage of doing so is that rural youth live among the poor and lower-middle peasants, laboring, studying, and criticizing revisionism together with them, creating conditions for the poor and lower-middle peasants to re-educate the youth. The poor and lower-middle peasants' deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao, good thoughts, good traditions, and good styles can be seen and learned by rural youth; the poor and lower-middle peasants can also clearly see and accurately grasp the youth's active thoughts, making it convenient to educate them with problems in mind. It is also convenient to manage them in life.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dushita Commune also helped rural youth learn from the PLA, insisting on the "Four Firsts" and promoting the "Three-Eight Style"; they established a set of organizational systems: the system of using Mao Zedong Thought, the system of thought summaries, the system of heart-to-heart talks, and the system of life meetings.

To strengthen the leadership of re-educating rural youth, under the unified leadership of the commune revolutionary committee, the commune and brigades established a "Rural Youth Re-education Committee" composed of poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, with revolutionary cadres and rural youth participating; production brigades with rural youth also established re-education small groups composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, brigade cadres, and rural youth. The commune revolutionary committee and brigade leading cadres each had an outstanding rural youth participate. Thus, the power of re-educating rural youth was guaranteed organizationally and firmly grasped by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Re-education of Rural Youth Is Excellent

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dushita Commune have three distinctive features in re-educating rural youth:

First, they grasp the root and implement proletarian political leadership, arming the minds of rural youth with Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, the old party committee of this commune implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, promoting "material incentives," resulting in "material leadership, the more it leads, the worse it gets." There was a clear contrast: this commune had a "youth point" where the farm work was light, the work points were high, the living conditions were good, and it was called a "sweet point." Another "youth point" was located in a mountain valley, people lived in thatched houses, the income was lower, the living conditions were harsh, and it was called a "bitter point." In the great storms of the proletarian cultural revolution, the situations of these two points were completely different. Under the poisoning of the bourgeois reactionary line, people in the "sweet point" once flowed back to the city in large numbers; people in the "bitter point," because they were with the poor and lower-middle peasants and often accepted their education, had a firm stand and did not waver. When someone incited them to return to the city to "rebel," they firmly said: rural youth going to the countryside is the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, the countryside is our home, the poor and lower-middle peasants are our parents, and our battlefield is right here.

The poor and lower-middle peasants grasped the power of re-education, trampling on "material incentives" and "money leadership." The poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most, believe in Mao Zedong Thought the most, and are loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They educate rural youth with Mao Zedong Thought at all times and in all places, often telling them the village history, family history, and revolutionary struggle history at the martyrs' graves, raising their class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness from all aspects. Over the past year, the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural youth of this commune have jointly held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carried out revolutionary criticism, and drawn clear lines between the two roads, two lines, and two ideologies. Revolutionary criticism exposed and criticized the black goods of revisionism such as "going to the countryside for gold plating" and "going to the countryside to become an official." Rural youth firmly expressed that they would become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture and successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Second, they educate in the practice of the three great revolutionary struggles. In the past, under the poisoning of the revisionist line, many rural youth did not understand class struggle. After going to the countryside, they were confined to the "youth points" for a long time, detached from politics and the poor and lower-middle peasants, still thinking that "going out in a group, not asking about class affairs, three uncles and two grandfathers are all family." They did not know that people were divided into classes. The poor and lower-middle peasants, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, educated them in the practice of the three great revolutionary struggles. The revolutionary committee of Congdun Production Brigade found that class struggle was sharp in a production brigade, so they organized rural youth and poor and lower-middle peasants to go there for investigation. Initially, they thought that the brigade was backward because the masses were backward and lacked labor power. After studying "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they opened their eyes and saw that it was a counter-revolutionary who was causing trouble. The poor and lower-middle peasants and they jointly exposed and struggled against this counter-revolutionary, and the brigade quickly changed. Rural youth deeply felt that sitting in the "youth points" made them ignorant of class struggle; going to the class struggle made them see the living class struggle and understand in practice that "class struggle, once grasped, is effective," and such skills are the most solid.

Third, in daily life, they grasp active thoughts and educate them in a timely manner. The poor and lower-middle peasants call this method "decoding." On one hand, the poor and lower-middle peasants, with their boundless love for Chairman Mao, clear class standpoint, and diligent and simple style, constantly influence them. On the other hand, they "decode" the problems exposed by the youth in a timely manner. Old peasant Shi Xingfen of Xitangdun once led the youth to repair a road. A few drops of rain fell from the sky, and the youth urged him, "Old Shi, aren't you going to stop work? It's going to rain!" This old peasant said, "Hurry what?! A few drops of rain scare you away, where is the spirit of not fearing sacrifice and overcoming all difficulties? How can we build socialism like this! We must struggle against difficulties!" The youth were deeply educated and shouted in unison, "Determine to fight, not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory!" They worked with renewed vigor. Rural youth felt from countless facts that this course could never be finished in a lifetime.

Practice has powerfully proven that re-educating rural youth by the poor and lower-middle peasants with Mao Zedong Thought has great advantages: it blocks the black alley of revisionism, destroys the nursery of revisionism, ensures the cultivation of reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and is beneficial for accelerating the revolutionization of intellectuals. Dushita Commune has already had 34 rural youth evaluated as active promoters of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought at the commune, county, prefecture, and provincial levels, 13 of whom have been elected by the poor and lower-middle peasants into the brigade leading cadres and the commune revolutionary committee, and many have become intellectuals welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers. The poor and lower-middle peasants of this commune said, "Chairman Mao entrusted the rural youth to us poor and lower-middle peasants for education, and we will not let them become good-for-nothings, letting Chairman Mao rest assured forever!"

    下乡知识青年必须由贫下中农给以再教育
     辽宁省新金县革命委员会
      从两条路线斗争看对下乡知识青年
      进行再教育的必要性
    双塔公社从一九六四年以来，接收了从旅大市下乡的二百二十四名知识青年。在下乡之前，党内头号走资派刘少奇推行的修正主义教育路线，在这些青年的思想上打上了“成名成家”、“轻视工农”的资产阶级烙印。刘少奇鼓吹什么青年“有文化”，下乡“种三、五年地”，“搞好和群众的关系”，就可以争取“当乡、县、省干部”。这个资本主义复辟势力的总代表亲自为青年设计的这幅“升官图”，象幽灵一样跟随着这些知识青年下了乡。彭屯大队有一个下乡知识青年在中学读书时，学校里的教师说他“具备专业运动员的天然素质”，“很有成名成家的希望”。下乡以后，他总觉得自己当农民是“高射炮打蚊子——大材小用”，想种几年地“取得农民资格”，再去投考体育学院，当专业运动员，将来破了国家纪录，那可就“前途光明”了。在农村干了几年以后，“成名成家”的愿望没有实现，于是他就闹起来，要回城市。在文化大革命中，他接受了贫下中农的再教育，努力学习毛泽东思想，成了县活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。
    对于知识青年上山下乡，走与工农兵结合的道路，党内一小撮走资派怕得要命，当他们还窃据一部分领导权的时候，曾经千方百计地阻挠、破坏。他们指责贫下中农对下乡知识青年“安置不当，照顾不好”，说什么下乡知识青年需要“居住集中，单独劳动，活计还得轻。”还胡说什么下乡知识青年是“新式农民”，贫下中农是“老式农民”，“新、老农民不要混了群”，要防止“新式农民”变了“性”，走了“型”。随着，就大建所谓“青年点”，叫下乡知识青年“单独劳动”，“自己管理自己”。就这样，下乡知识青年从“旧学校”的深宅大院刚冲出来，就又被关进大队“青年点”的深宅大院。杨屯大队的一位下乡知识青年，下乡三年，只到过一户贫农社员家里，还是为了找水喝去的。贫下中农沉痛地说，这些青年人“住在咱村，不进咱门，不认咱人！”在文化大革命前，土城子大队曾六次派贫下中农进“青年点”办毛泽东思想大学校，结果都受到阻挠，没有办成。
    农村中没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，也拚命破坏知识青年上山下乡与工农结合。他们利用下乡知识青年缺乏政治经验和头脑中有“私”字的弱点，对青年进行腐蚀、诱骗，极力把他们往资本主义泥坑里拉。
    人们清楚地看到：无产阶级和资产阶级象“拔河”一样，在争夺青年。由贫下中农给下乡知识青年以再教育，是阶级斗争的需要，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的需要，是巩固无产阶级专政的需要。
      贫下中农必须把教育下乡知识青年
  的大权掌握在手里
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。在对下乡知识青年进行再教育的问题上，同样存在着由谁掌握领导权的问题。双塔公社的经验证明，由贫下中农给下乡知识青年以再教育，是有阻力的，是要经过斗争的。阶级敌人挑拨说：“念书人不如种地的，下乡种地还受农民的欺。”有的中修正主义教育路线的毒较深的下乡知识青年说：“贫下中农大老粗，土里土气，能教育个啥！”有极少数贫下中农也认为：“知识青年能说会道，理论成套，咱教育不了。”因此，公社革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队认为，要搞好对下乡知识青年的再教育，必须把思想上的领导权掌握在贫下中农手里。于是，他们在全公社组织贫下中农和下乡知识青年一起，深入地学习了毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示和有关知识分子与工农相结合的教导，批判了“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”和“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动谬论，批判了叛徒刘少奇的“农民落后论”，批判了轻视工农、轻视实践的资产阶级思想。许多下乡知识青年愤慨地说：“旧教育制度往我们脑袋里一个劲儿地灌名灌利，就是不讲革命。念了八、九年书，只知数、理、化，不懂敌、我、友。”通过革命大批判，使下乡知识青年认识到，接受不接受贫下中农再教育，是站在毛主席革命路线上还是站在资产阶级反动路线上，是做无产阶级革命事业接班人还是做资产阶级接班人的大问题。广大贫下中农则进一步认识到，给下乡知识青年以再教育，是伟大领袖毛主席给的光荣任务，是保证我们国家千秋万代永不变颜色的根本大计。
    在这个基础上，贫下中农和下乡知识青年一起，遵照毛主席“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”的教导，打破了叛徒刘少奇在辽宁和在新金的代理人所推行的下乡知识青年“大队建点，单独劳动，自己管理自己”的规定；同时，也纠正了“分人到户，与社员同等相待”，忽视了再教育的放任现象。大家一致认为，下乡知识青年单独劳动，自己管理自己，跟贫下中农“扯不上筋，挂不上骨，没有靠帮”。这样的“青年点”，贫下中农没有掌握再教育大权，无产阶级没有占领思想阵地，资产阶级思想必然自由泛滥。贫下中农和下乡知识青年共同研究认为，最好的办法是：把点建在生产队里，或者“大队建点，集体插队”，即十几人集体插入到生产队中去。这样做的好处是：下乡知识青年生活在贫下中农之中，和贫下中农实行同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修，为贫下中农给知识青年以再教育创造了条件。贫下中农无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情和好思想，好传统，好作风，下乡知识青年能看得见，学得到；贫下中农对知识青年的活思想也能看得清，摸得准，便于带着问题进行教育。在生活上也便于管理。
    双塔公社贫下中农还帮助下乡知识青年向解放军学习，坚持“四个第一”，大兴“三八作风”；建立了一套组织制度：活学活用毛泽东思想讲用制度、思想总结制度、谈心制度、生活会制度。
    为了加强对下乡知识青年再教育的领导，在公社革委会统一领导下，公社和大队建立了以贫下中农为主体，有革命干部和下乡知识青年参加的三结合的“下乡知识青年再教育委员会”；有下乡知识青年的生产队，也建立了贫下中农、生产队干部和下乡知识青年三结合的再教育小组。公社革委会和大队领导班子，都有一名优秀的下乡知识青年参加。这样，就从组织上保证了对下乡知识青年进行再教育的大权，牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里。
  贫下中农给下乡知识青年以再教育好得很
    双塔公社的贫下中农对下乡知识青年进行再教育，有三个显著特点：
    一、千头万绪抓根本，实行无产阶级政治挂帅，用毛泽东思想武装下乡知识青年的头脑。过去，双塔公社旧党委，执行刘少奇及其同伙的资产阶级反动路线，搞“物质刺激”，结果是“物质挂帅，越挂越坏”。有一个明显的对比：这个公社有个“青年点”，农活轻，分值高，青堂瓦舍生活好，被人称为“甜点”。另有一个“青年点”，处在山沟，人住茅屋，收入较低，生活艰苦，被人称为“苦点”。在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪里，这两个点的情况完全不同。在资产阶级反动路线的毒害下，“甜点”里的人，曾一度纷纷回流城市；“苦点”里的人，由于和贫下中农在一起，经常接受贫下中农的教育，立场坚定，毫不动摇。有人煽动他们回城“造反”时，他们坚定地说：知识青年下乡是毛主席指出的方向，农村是我们的家，贫下中农是我们的爹妈，我们的阵地就在脚下。
    贫下中农掌握了再教育的大权，什么“物质刺激”，什么“金钱挂帅”，统统踩在脚下。贫下中农最热爱毛主席，最信仰毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的革命路线。时时、处处用毛泽东思想教育下乡知识青年，经常给他们讲村史，讲家史，到烈士墓前讲革命斗争史，从各方面提高他们的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。去年以来，这个公社的贫下中农和下乡知识青年一起，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判，划清两条道路、两条路线、两种思想的界限。革命大批判把“下乡镀金”、“下乡作官”等修正主义黑货批臭了。下乡知识青年坚定地表示：要做有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，做无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    二、在三大革命斗争实践中进行教育。过去，在修正主义路线毒害下，许多下乡知识青年不懂阶级斗争，下乡后，由于长期圈在“青年点”里，脱离政治，脱离贫下中农，仍然是“出门一大群，不问阶级事，三叔二大爷，都是一家人”。不知人群中是划分为阶级的。贫下中农就以毛泽东思想为指针，在三大革命斗争的实践中对他们进行教育。丛屯大队革委会发现有一个生产队阶级斗争尖锐，就组织下乡知识青年和贫下中农一起去搞调查。起初，他们认为这个生产队所以落后是群众落后，缺少劳动力。经过和贫下中农一起学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》，擦亮了眼睛，才看到是一个反革命分子搞的鬼。贫下中农和他们一起把这个反革命分子揪出来斗争了，这个队很快发生了变化。下乡知识青年深有体会地说：蹲在“青年点”里，对阶级斗争一窍不通；到阶级斗争中去一看活生生，在实践中懂得了“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”，这样学到的本领最过硬。
    三、在日常生活中，抓住活思想，及时地进行教育，贫下中农管这种方法叫“破解”。一方面，贫下中农以自己无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级感情、鲜明的阶级观点和勤劳朴实的作风，时时熏染着他们。另一方面，针对知识青年随时暴露出来的问题，及时给予“破解”。西唐屯老贫农史行凤一次领知识青年修公路，空中落了几滴雨，青年们就催逼他：“老史大爷，还不下班呀！快要下雨了。”这位老贫农说：“慌什么？！几滴雨就吓跑了，不怕牺牲，排除万难的精神哪去了？这样干，还能建设社会主义啊！咱得向困难作斗争哪！”青年们听了，深受教育，齐喊“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利！”干得格外有劲。下乡知识青年从无数事实中感到，这种课程一辈子也学不完。
    实践有力地证明：由贫下中农用毛泽东思想给下乡知识青年以再教育好处极大：堵住了修正主义的黑胡同，摧毁了修正主义的苗圃，保证了培养无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人，有利于加速知识分子的革命化。双塔公社已经有三十四名知识青年被评为社、县、专区、省活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，有十三人被贫下中农选进大队领导班子和公社革委会，许多人已经成为工农兵所欢迎的知识分子。这个公社的贫下中农说：“毛主席把知识青年交给咱贫下中农教育，咱就是不让他出败家子，让毛主席他老人家永远放心！”
