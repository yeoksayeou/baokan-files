The cooperative medical system implemented in Le Yuan Commune, Changyang County, Hubei Province, is a new initiative born out of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a manifestation of Chairman Mao's great concern for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian health line!

We believe that the implementation of the cooperative medical system is not just about pooling money economically, but more importantly, it strengthens political class solidarity. The poor and lower-middle peasants have always been close-knit, helping each other in times of need. The practices in Le Yuan Commune are in line with the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Regarding how to implement the cooperative medical system, we have the following suggestions:

1. To implement the cooperative medical system, we must continue to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and widely propagate Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." We must thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist medical and health line.

2. The poor and lower-middle peasants should take control of rural medical and health affairs. The commune and production brigade should form a cooperative medical leadership group consisting of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary medical personnel, and revolutionary cadres, under the leadership of the commune and production brigade revolutionary committees. This group should expel the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists hidden within the medical team. We should vigorously cultivate "barefoot doctors" to build a truly revolutionary medical team that serves the poor and lower-middle peasants and manage the cooperative medical funds well.

3. For poor and lower-middle peasants who genuinely have financial difficulties, they can pay less or not pay the cooperative medical funds, and this money should be covered by the public welfare fund of the production team.

4. We should strive to achieve the goal of treating illnesses with minimal or no cost. Our province has a long winter season, making it easy to contract common colds, asthma, coughs, and back and leg pain, which results in significant medical expenses. We suggest that medical personnel vigorously promote acupuncture therapy and learn effective and scientifically sound folk remedies. There is a saying in Jilin: "A folk remedy can cure a major illness." We can also collect and use locally produced medicinal materials to save on medical expenses.

5. For the children of landlords and rich peasants who have good political performance, high ideological awareness, and work hard, after discussion and approval by the poor and lower-middle peasants, they can participate in the cooperative medical system.

    几点建议
    湖北省长阳县乐园公社实行的合作医疗制度，是无产阶级文化大革命中的一个新创举，是毛主席对贫下中农的巨大关怀，是毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线的巨大胜利！
    我们认为，实行合作医疗制度，不光是经济上一元一元钱的集中，更主要的是政治上阶级友爱的加强。贫下中农从来就是心连心的，一家有事大家相帮。乐园公社的作法，最合我们贫下中农的心意。
    关于如何实行合作医疗制度，我们有以下几点建议：
    一、实行合作医疗制度，要继续深入地开展革命大批判，广泛地宣传毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示，彻底批判刘少奇的修正主义医疗卫生路线。
    二、贫下中农要把农村医疗卫生大权掌起来。公社和生产大队要由贫下中农、革命的医务人员和革命干部组成合作医疗领导小组，在公社和生产大队革委会领导下，把隐藏在医疗队伍中的地、富、反、坏、右分子清除出去，大力培养
  “赤脚医生”，建立一支真正为贫下中农服务的革命化的医疗队伍，切实把合作医疗基金管理好。
    三、经济上确实有困难的贫下中农，可以少缴或不缴合作医疗基金，这笔钱由生产队的公益金支出。
    四、尽量做到少花钱、不花钱也治病。我们省冬季时间较长，容易得伤风感冒、哮喘咳嗽、腰腿痛等病，医疗费用开支较大。我们建议医务人员大力推广针灸疗法，学会行之有效、合乎科学的土方。我们吉林有一句话：“偏方治大病。”还可以采集使用当地出产的药材，以节约医药费。
    五、地富子女中那些政治表现好、思想觉悟高，劳动也好的，经过贫下中农讨论通过，可以参加合作医疗。
