	Recently, local newspapers have continued to publish a large number of letters and articles from workers, members of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary parents, and revolutionary teachers in the discussion on how urban primary and secondary schools should be run. Many readers of these newspapers have also engaged in heated discussions on how to run primary schools in neighborhoods.

	Regarding the issue of neighborhood schools, the opinions expressed in the letters and articles published by local newspapers can be roughly divided into three categories: first, those who believe that primary schools in cities should be mainly run by neighborhoods in conjunction with factories; second, those who believe that factories should take the lead, with neighborhoods providing support; third, those who believe that primary schools should be run jointly by factories, communes, and neighborhoods. Some newspapers have also published experiences from areas where neighborhood schools have already been established.

	In the discussion, the main reasons given by those who advocate for neighborhood schools are as follows: it can integrate school education, social education, and family education. They believe that neighborhoods have many small factories and a large number of retired workers, which are favorable conditions for running neighborhood schools. Neighborhood schools can also be led by the revolutionary committees of provinces, cities, and districts through neighborhood revolutionary leading groups to implement proletarian political leadership. They can invite retired workers or non-full-time workers to take charge of the school's leadership and teach, realizing the leadership of the working class over the school. In cities, the population is dense and there are many neighborhoods, so running neighborhood schools can be tailored to local conditions. This way, schools can better open their doors to the children of laborers, promote universal education, and change the unreasonable layout of schools. Neighborhoods are also the frontline of class struggle, and running neighborhood schools can organize revolutionary teachers and students to directly participate in the class struggle in society.

    各地报纸讨论动态
    最近，各地报纸在进行关于城市小学及中学应当如何办的讨论中，继续刊登了大量工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队队员、革命干部、革命家长和革命教师的来稿、来信。许多报纸的读者，还就街道如何办小学的问题展开了热烈的讨论。
    关于街道办学问题，各地报纸刊登的读者来稿、来信的意见，大致可分三类：一、认为城市中的小学应以街道为主，和工厂结合来办；二、认为应以工厂为主，由街道配合来办；三、认为小学应由工厂、公社、街道三结合来办。有些报纸还刊登了某些已由街道办小学的经验。
    在讨论中，主张城市的小学应由街道来办的理由，主要是：可以把学校教育、社会教育、家庭教育结合起来。他们认为，街道里有不少街道工厂和大批退休工人，这是街道办学的有利条件。街道办小学还可由省、市、区革命委员会通过街道革命领导小组实行无产阶级的政治领导，而且可以请退休工人或不脱产的在职工人掌握学校的领导大权，并担任学校的教员，实现工人阶级对学校的领导。在城市里，人口密集，街道较多，街道办学，可因地制宜，这样，学校能更好地为劳动人民子弟开门，普及教育，改变学校布局不合理的现象。街道也是阶级斗争的前沿阵地，街道办学可以组织革命师生直接参加社会上的阶级斗争。
