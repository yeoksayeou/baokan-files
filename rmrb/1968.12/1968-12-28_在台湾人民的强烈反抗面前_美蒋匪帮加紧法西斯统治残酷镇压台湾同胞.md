The Chiang bandits are in a state of panic and anxiety in the face of strong resistance from their Taiwanese compatriots. Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, they are intensifying their fascist rule and further suppressing the Taiwanese people.

According to reports from Taiwanese newspapers, the Chiang bandits recently issued nearly ten reactionary measures within a month to restrict the freedom of movement of their Taiwanese compatriots. The reports say that after conducting so-called "population rectification" household surveys in Taiwan starting on November 1, the Chiang bandits' Taiwan "Garrison Command" issued five reactionary decrees on November 8, including "Procedures for Requesting Entry and Exit to Coastal and Important Military Facilities in Taiwan During Martial Law" and "Temporary Management Measures for Public Employees in Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan Entering and Exiting the Border." These decrees impose restrictions on the freedom of movement of Taiwanese compatriots. The Chiang bandits' Taiwan "Garrison Command" also ordered all plastic factories in Taiwan to use high-frequency welding machines, specifying that they must operate at frequencies designated by the Chiang bandits and prohibiting any unauthorized modifications to convert the machines into transmitters or broadcasting equipment.

According to reports, the Chiang bandits have recently been expanding their police and secret service systems. To prevent Taiwanese people from "illegally emigrating," the Chiang bandits approved the establishment of a water patrol squad by the Taiwan "Provincial Police Administration." The Chiang bandits have also set up numerous so-called "volunteer police" across Taiwan to monitor and suppress the resistance activities of the Taiwanese people. According to the Chiang bandits' _Central Daily News_, there are currently over 23,000 "volunteer police" in various counties and cities in Taiwan. On November 8, the Chiang bandits also "revised" the "Regulations on the Use of Police Weapons," openly ordering the police to use batons, swords, and firearms to suppress the Taiwanese people. The Chiang bandits' secret service agency, the "Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau," has, over the past two months, deceived and forced more than 2,000 college students to undergo short-term "professional" training to serve as secret agents for the Chiang bandits.

Recently, the Chiang bandits, under the pretext of "maintaining order," have dispatched large numbers of military police and secret agents to conduct mass arrests across Taiwan. The _Taiwan Evening News_ revealed that in Kaohsiung, where U.S.-Chiang military bases are concentrated, 803 people were arrested in just four hours during the early morning of September 27. The Chiang bandits' mass arrests in Taiwan have created a terrifying atmosphere. The Chiang bandits' _United Daily News_ admitted on November 21 that the Chiang bandits' current view of their Taiwanese compatriots is that "everyone is suspicious," and therefore, Taiwanese compatriots "are always at risk of being detained."

According to the Chiang bandits' _Central Daily News_, to "prevent" internal rebellions, the Chiang bandits have dispatched numerous "inspection teams" to various agencies and schools to investigate the "lifestyle, behavior, and integrity" of relevant personnel. "If any law-breaking or disciplinary offenders are found, they will be punished according to law." They have also ordered all retired soldiers, military families, and gun owners to surrender their firearms and ammunition within a specified period. In addition, the Chiang bandits have recently imposed extremely reactionary speech controls on the Taiwanese people. In the "National Defense Education Weekly" published in the _China Daily_, more than ten "precautions" are listed, instructing subordinates of the Chiang bandits "not to defame superiors or colleagues, not to criticize politics," and urging the Taiwanese people to "control their psychology and emotions," and "not to participate in political and social debates involving others." The deeper the oppression of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries on their Taiwanese compatriots, the greater the resistance they will face. The fascist rule and bloody suppression of the U.S.-Chiang bandits will not only fail to weaken the strong resistance of their Taiwanese compatriots but will also provoke even greater resistance.

    在台湾人民的强烈反抗面前
    美蒋匪帮加紧法西斯统治残酷镇压台湾同胞
    新华社二十七日讯　蒋匪帮在台湾同胞的强烈反抗面前恐慌不安，在美帝国主义指使下，正加紧法西斯统治，进一步镇压台湾人民。
    据台湾报纸透露，蒋匪帮不久前在不到一个月里，就连续公布了近十项限制台湾同胞行动自由的反动措施。报道说，继十一月一日开始在台湾进行了所谓“人口校正”的户口调查后，十一月八日，蒋匪帮台湾“警备总司令部”又公布了“戒严时期台湾地区各机关及人民申请进出海岸及重要军事设施地区办法”、“金马台湾公教员工出入境暂行管理办法”等五项反动法令，对台湾同胞的行动自由强加限制。蒋匪帮台湾“警备总司令部”还通令台湾各塑胶工厂，命令他们使用高周波熔接机，必须按蒋匪帮指定的频率，不得私自把机器改装为发射机或广播机使用等等。
    据报道，蒋匪帮最近不断扩充了它的警察和特务系统。为了防止台湾人民“偷渡”出境，蒋匪帮批准台湾“省警务处”增设水警巡逻队。蒋匪帮在台湾各地还设置了大批所谓“义务警察”，监视和镇压台湾人民的反抗活动。据蒋匪帮《中央日报》透露，目前台湾各县市共有“义警”达两万三千多人。十一月八日，蒋匪帮还“修订”了“警械使用条例”，公然命令警察对台湾人民使用警棍、警刀和枪械进行镇压。蒋匪帮的特务机构——“司法行政部调查局”最近两个月来，欺骗和强迫二千多名大专学校学生接受了短期“专业”训练，充当蒋匪帮的特务。
    最近，蒋匪帮还借口“维持治安”，出动大批军警特务，在台湾全境进行大逮捕。台湾《大华晚报》透露，在美蒋军事基地遍布的高雄，仅在九月二十七日凌晨的四个小时内，就有八百零三人被捕。蒋匪帮在台湾大肆捕人，使台湾笼罩着一片恐怖气氛。蒋匪帮《联合报》十一月二十一日供认，目前蒋匪帮对台湾同胞的“观点”是“人人皆可疑”，因此，台湾同胞“随时都有被扣的危险”。
    据蒋匪帮《中央日报》透露，为了“防止”内部造反，蒋匪帮还派出了许多“考察团”，到各机关、学校，调查有关人员的“生活、言行、操守”等，“如发现违法犯纪人员，依法惩办”。并勒令所有退役蒋军、军人家属和有枪枝的人，限期交出枪枝、弹药。此外，蒋匪帮最近还对台湾人民实施了极端反动的言论统制。在台湾《中华日报》刊登的“国民保防教育周刊”中，罗列了十多条“注意事项”，要蒋匪帮下级人员“不诋毁官长、同事，不批评政治”，要台湾人民“控制自己的心理与情绪”，“不参加他人有关的政治和社会间的辩论”，等等。美蒋反动派对台湾同胞的压迫越深，它所受到的反抗就越大。美蒋匪帮的法西斯统治和血腥镇压，不但不能削弱台湾同胞强烈的反抗意志，而且必将激起更大的反抗。
