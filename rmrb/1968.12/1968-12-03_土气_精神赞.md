Title: In Praise of the "Rustic" Spirit

In the great tide of the struggle, criticism, and reform, the most reliable ally of the working class, the so-called "illiterate peasants" — the poor and lower-middle peasants — have marched into the school gates and onto the lecture platform with heads held high. They have broken the monopoly of the bourgeois intellectuals and begun a new era of poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools.

The schools run by the poor and lower-middle peasants do not need bright classrooms or advanced teaching aids. What they need is education serving proletarian politics, education combined with productive labor, the spirit of self-reliance, and the cultivation of reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat seeks to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also seeks to transform the world according to its worldview." How can the new-type schools run by the poor and lower-middle peasants suit the tastes of the bourgeoisie? Indeed, amidst the cheers of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers, there are still a few stubborn bourgeois intellectuals who deride the new-type schools run by the poor and lower-middle peasants as being too "rustic." This is not surprising. In their eyes, schools should be full of "foreign influence," and if the students educated there do not lose the character of the working people, they are "rustic." Little do they know that the "rustic" spirit they deride is precisely the character of the working people, the proletarian heritage.

People will not forget that in the early days of our army, the Red Army, armed with big knives and long spears, swept away thousands of enemies. Chiang Kai-shek did not curse us as being "rustic"? It was amidst the curses and condemnations of the reactionaries that the people's army grew from small to large, becoming stronger with each battle!

In the first new-type university established by the proletariat, the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University," countless revolutionary youths studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought by the light of soybean oil lamps, using bullet casings as pens. The bourgeoisie did not curse us as being "rustic"? It was amidst the curses of the reactionaries that the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" trained tens of thousands of outstanding warriors loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause!

On the battlefield in Korea, our Chinese People's Volunteers fought the American devils, who were armed to the teeth, with rice and rifles. The imperialists did not curse us as being "rustic"? It was amidst these curses that we defeated the imperialists, who were as vicious as wolves!

When the soldiers of the Eighth Company, dressed in the old red army's cloth socks and straw sandals, stood proudly under the neon lights of Nanjing Road, the bourgeoisie did not cover their noses and curse us as being "rustic"? It was amidst these curses that our revolutionary soldiers remained unstained, and their revolutionary will was tempered even more strongly!

Today, in the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, it is with this "rustic" spirit that the proletariat has swept all the emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women into the historical garbage heap, bringing proletarian heroes onto the stage of literature and art, and playing the strongest melody of Mao Zedong Thought that resonates through the universe.

With this "rustic" spirit, the working class in our country has created countless miracles unheard of and unseen in history...

Look! The vast army of industrial workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, with their calloused hands holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," have marched into places where intellectuals abound, seized the political stage of the superstructure, and are leading the struggle, criticism, and reform in various fields of the superstructure to victory.

Now that the poor and lower-middle peasants have taken control of cultural power, they are establishing new-type schools that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought with a magnificent revolutionary spirit. The proletariat will certainly, with its inherent revolutionary style — that is, the "rustic" spirit that people deride — create a bright red new world under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

    “土气”精神赞
    战士　罗志华
    在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，工人阶级最可靠的同盟者，被称之为“斗大的字不识一口袋”的“乡巴佬”——贫下中农，雄赳赳气昂昂地开进了学校的大门，登上了讲台。打破了资产阶级知识分子独霸的一统天下，开始了贫下中农管理学校的新纪元。
    贫下中农办的学校，不要什么敞亮的教室，不要什么高级的教具，要的是教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，要的是穷棒子精神，要的是培养无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”贫下中农办起来的一所所新型学校，哪里能适合资产阶级的口味？不是吗，在广大贫下中农、革命教师的一片欢呼声中，也有那么几个顽固的资产阶级知识分子还在贬斥贫下中农办的新型学校太“土气”了。这也不足为怪，在他们看来，学校就该充满“洋气”，培养出来的学生如果不丢掉劳动人民的本色，便是“土气”。殊不知他们所贬斥的“土气”正是劳动人民的本色，正是无产阶级的传家宝。
    人们不会忘记，在我军初创时期，工农红军手执大刀、长矛横扫千军，蒋介石不是咬牙切齿地骂我们“土气”吗？正是在反动派的叫骂和诅咒声中，人民军队由小到大，越战越强！
    在无产阶级自己创办的第一所新型大学“抗日军政大学”中，无数革命青年案置豆油灯，手握弹壳笔，学习马列主义、毛泽东思想。资产阶级不是骂我们“土气”吗？正是在反动派的叫骂声中，“抗大”培养了成千上万忠于无产阶级革命事业的优秀战士！
    在朝鲜战场上，我们中国人民志愿军用小米加步枪与武装到牙齿的美国鬼子搏斗，帝国主义不是骂我们“土气”吗？正是在这种叫骂声中，我们战胜了豺狼成性的帝国主义！
    好八连的战士穿着老红军的布袜和草鞋，飒爽英姿地屹立在南京路的霓虹灯下的时候，资产阶级不是捂着鼻子骂“土气”吗？正是在这叫骂声中，我们革命战士一尘不染，革命意志锻炼得更加坚强！
    今天，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，就凭着“土气”的精神，无产阶级把一切帝王将相、才子佳人统统扫进了历史垃圾堆，让文艺舞台上出现了无产阶级的英雄形象，奏出了响彻宇宙的毛泽东思想的最强音。
    就凭这“土气”的精神，我国工人阶级开创了多少历史上闻所未闻，见所未见的人间奇迹……。
    看！浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军和贫下中农，那双长满老茧的手，紧握着《毛主席语录》开进了知识分子成堆的地方，占领了上层建筑的政治舞台，胜利地领导着上层建筑各个领域的斗批改。
    如今贫下中农掌握了文权，正以豪迈的革命气概，创立了一所所闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新型学校。无产阶级还必将凭着自己固有的革命风格——也就是被人们所贬斥的“土气”，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，创造出一个红彤彤的新世界来。　（原载《吉林日报》，本报有删改）
