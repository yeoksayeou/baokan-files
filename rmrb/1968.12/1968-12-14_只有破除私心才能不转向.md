Only by eliminating selfishness can one avoid deviating. The fact that rural teachers do not receive state salaries helps to bridge the gap between teachers and poor and lower-middle peasants, marking a step forward on the path of revolutionization. If teachers do not integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they cannot consciously and actively implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

In 1959, after graduating from a normal school, I became a teacher at a state-run primary school. In 1963, I was sent down to our production brigade to become a rural teacher. From these two different leaderships, different treatments, and different practices, I deeply felt that a rural primary school teacher transitioning from a state-run school to a rural school is a new path, a revolutionary path, a path of wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The present situation and old habits often bind people's minds tightly, even revolutionaries sometimes cannot escape this." My experience of the ideological transformation from teaching in a state-run school to a rural school is a process of relying on Mao Zedong Thought for guidance from above and the poor and lower-middle peasants for education from below, fighting against the constraints of the present situation and old habits in my mind. The crux of the struggle is whether to serve the public or the self, which is the question of whether to be revolutionary or not.

When I was first sent down to the brigade to teach in a rural school, I couldn't understand it. At that time, I mistakenly thought that I had studied for over ten years, had been a teacher at a state-run primary school for four years, and was at least a state cadre; now, being sent down to the countryside to be a commune member was a "big talent in a small role," and I would be laughed at; not receiving a salary, I couldn't labor, and my life had no guarantee. I thought, it's better to just be a commune member and not do anything. Just at this time, the poor and lower-middle peasants and the brigade cadres warmly said to me: "Chairman Mao calls for the great development of agriculture, and you coming back is just in time. It's not just you, even if it were ten or a hundred of you, we need you." My grandfather, old peasant Jiang Xigui, is my uncle. He said, "Granddaughter, you coming back is great. We are short of teachers here." My parents also touched on my sore spot: "It is Chairman Mao who saved us and educated you. You must not forget Chairman Mao's teachings." So I thought, isn't that right? My father had been a hired laborer and begged for food. Our family has been "illiterate" for generations. It is all thanks to Chairman Mao that I became the first literate person in our family. The poor and lower-middle peasants nurtured me with their blood and sweat, and Mao Zedong Thought nourished me into a person, but after being a teacher at a state-run primary school for a few days, I didn't want to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, isn't this being ungrateful? As Vice Chairman Lin said, "If you don't understand what class is, don't understand what exploitation is, you don't understand revolution." It was because I forgot the bitterness of the class struggle and the poor and lower-middle peasants' strong desire for cultural liberation that I didn't want to be a rural school teacher.

After a struggle in my thoughts, I accepted the recommendation of the poor and lower-middle peasants and took on the role of a rural school teacher in the brigade, also taking on the role of women's work in the brigade.

However, our rural school is only separated from the state-run school by a wall. Seeing that the state-run teachers are under the leadership of the county's education bureau and the central school, and are considered state cadres, while I am under the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants and am an ordinary commune member. State-run teachers receive fixed salaries, eat state-supplied grain, and enjoy free medical care, while my treatment is the same as that of a commune member. Gradually, I was again bewitched by bourgeois individualism and had the thought of not wanting to be a rural teacher. At this time, I participated in a commune member's study session on the "Three Articles," listening to many poor and lower-middle peasants talk about their moving deeds of being "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people, "selflessly dedicating themselves to others." I thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants farm for the revolution, and I am also a rural teacher for the revolution. Why can the poor and lower-middle peasants use the measure of "no selfishness" to demand of themselves, but I cannot? Thinking and thinking, I gradually realized that it was because the "self" in my mind had not been eradicated, so I saw good things as bad things. Take the fact that rural teachers do not receive state salaries, for example. This originally helps to bridge the gap between teachers and poor and lower-middle peasants, marking a step forward on the path of revolutionization, but I saw it as being inferior to others.

From then on, I felt more and more that I must seriously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly transform my worldview. Only in this way can I eradicate my selfish thoughts, and only by eradicating selfish thoughts can I keep up with the situation and not deviate in the face of major issues. From then on, I gradually realized that rural schools are better than state-run schools. The biggest advantage is that they can implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." Looking back, when I was a teacher at a state-run primary school, because the school implemented Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, I not only did not participate in labor, but I also did not teach students to labor. Now that I am a rural school teacher and have become an ordinary commune member in the brigade, my heart is close to that of the poor and lower-middle peasants. I understand that the past way of doing things could not cultivate students into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. I understand that a teacher who does not integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants cannot consciously implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. State-run primary schools being sent down to the brigade to be run is a revolutionary path for primary school teachers. I will firmly walk this path and sincerely serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life.

    只有破除私心才能不转向
    民办教师不拿国家工资，有助于消除教师同贫下中农之间的鸿沟，是在革命化的道路上前进了一步。教师不同贫下中农结合，就不可能自觉地、积极地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。
    一九五九年我从初师毕业后，就当了公办小学教师，一九六三年下放到我们生产大队当了民办教师。从两种不同领导、不同待遇、不同实践中，我深刻体会到，一个农村小学教师从教公办小学到教民办小学，是一条崭新的道路，革命的道路，全心全意为贫下中农服务的道路。
    毛主席教导我们说：“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。”我所经历的从教公办小学到教民办小学的思想变化过程，就是上靠毛泽东思想指引，下靠贫下中农教育，同自己头脑中的现状和旧习惯的束缚作斗争的过程。斗争的焦点是为公还是为私的问题，也就是革命还是不革命的问题。
    我刚下放到大队教民办小学的时候，很想不通。当时错误地认为，自己读了十多年书，又当了四年公办小学教师，大小也算是个国家干部；现在下放回家当社员，是“大材小用”，将被人笑话；不拿工资，自己又不能劳动，生活没有保证。心想，干脆当个社员，什么事情也不做了。正当这个时候，贫下中农和大队干部热情地对我说：“毛主席号召大办农业，你回来正是时候，不要说是你一个，就是十个、一百个我们也需要。”老贫农姜习会是我的堂爷爷。他说：“孙女呀，你回来好极了，我们这里正缺教师。”我的父母更是说到了我的心酸处：“是毛主席救了我们，教育了你，你可不能忘掉毛主席的教导。”于是我想：可不是吗？我爹爹当过雇工，讨过饭，我家几代都是“睁眼瞎”。全亏毛主席，我才成了我们家第一代识字人。贫下中农用血汗把我养大，毛泽东思想的阳光雨露把我哺育成人，而我当了几天公办小学教师，就不想为贫下中农服务了，这不是忘本吗？正如林副主席说的，“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”我就是因为忘记了阶级苦，忘记了贫下中农迫切要求文化翻身的强烈愿望，才不想当民办小学教师的。
    经过一番思想斗争，我接受了贫下中农的推荐，担任了大队的民办小学教师，又兼做了大队妇女工作。
    但是，我们民办小学同公办小学只有一墙之隔。眼看着公办教师属县文教局、中心校领导，算国家干部；而我属贫下中农领导，是个普通社员。公办教师拿固定工资，吃国家供应粮，享受公费医疗，而我的一切待遇和社员一样。慢慢地，我又被资产阶级个人主义迷住了心窍，产生了不想当民办教师的念头。这时我参加了一次社员学习“老三篇”的讲用会，听了许多贫下中农谈他们“完全”“彻底”地为人民，“毫不利己专门利人”的动人事迹。我想，贫下中农为革命种田，我不也是为革命做民办教师吗？为什么贫下中农就能够用“毫无自私自利之心”的尺子要求自己，我为什么就不能呢？想来想去，我逐渐认识到是自己脑子里的“私”字还没有挖掉，所以把好事看成了坏事。就拿民办教师不拿国家工资的事来说吧，这本来有助于消除教师同贫下中农之间的鸿沟，是在革命化的道路上前进了一步，可是我却把它看成了低人一等。
    从此，我越来越感到自己必须认真活学活用毛泽东思想，彻底改造世界观。只有这样才能挖掉自己的私心杂念，也只有挖掉私心杂念，才能使自己的思想跟上形势，在大是大非面前不转向。从这以后，我才逐步认识到民办小学比公办小学好，最大的好处就是能够贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。毛主席早就指出：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”。回想我当公办小学教师时，因为学校贯彻的是刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，不仅自己不参加劳动，也不教学生劳动。自己当了民办小学教师，成为大队的一个普通社员，和贫下中农的心贴在一起，懂得了过去那种做法根本不可能把学生培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，懂得了一个教师不同贫下中农结合，就不可能自觉地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。公办小学下放到大队来办，对于小学教师是一条革命化的道路，我要坚定地沿着这条道路走下去，诚诚恳恳地为贫下中农服务一辈子。
