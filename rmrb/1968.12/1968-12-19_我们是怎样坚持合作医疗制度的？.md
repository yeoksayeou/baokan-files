Our five specific measures are as follows: First, mobilize the masses to combat the disruptive activities of class enemies; second, organize the poor and lower-middle peasants and medical personnel to study and apply Chairman Mao's instructions on medical work; third, investigate the prevalence of common and frequent diseases and launch mass preventive work; fourth, train health personnel at the brigade and production team levels; fifth, use more traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture to treat diseases and promote traditional Chinese medicine.

The cooperative medical system in Le Yuan Commune, Changyang County, Hubei Province, is excellent. It embodies Chairman Mao's revolutionary medical line, points out the direction for rural medical and health work, and fully meets the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We wholeheartedly support it.

Our commune's medical system is somewhat different from that of Le Yuan Commune, but the general direction is the same. The poor and lower-middle peasants call our commune's medical system "unified medical care." At the end of 1965 and the beginning of 1966, based on Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," and with the active support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we implemented the unified medical care system for the entire commune, starting from the specific conditions of our commune. The specific method is: each person contributes 2.5 yuan from the production team's public welfare fund annually as medical expenses, which are managed and used collectively by the commune. Community members do not need to pay for medical treatment and medication, but only pay 0.5 yuan for registration each time they see a doctor. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists do not enjoy the benefits of unified medical care. Doctors in the commune hospital receive fixed salaries, which are paid from the medical expenses.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Throughout the socialist period, there are classes and class struggle. This class struggle is long-term, complex, and sometimes very intense." The process of implementing and persisting with the unified medical care system in our commune is a sharp struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, and it is also a process of victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian medical line. After the implementation of the unified medical care system, it aroused the extreme hatred and sabotage of class enemies. Some of them said, "This method is like a rabbit's tail that can't grow long." Others incited the masses by saying, "It's better to distribute the money to the community members, and whoever wants to see a doctor can see one, and whoever doesn't want to see one can disperse." Under the incitement of class enemies, a small number of community members with fewer people, better economic conditions, and who rarely get sick felt they were at a disadvantage and wavered. Some community members thought that now there was a solution, and regardless of major or minor illnesses, they rushed to the hospital, frequently saw doctors, demanded good medicine, spent a lot of money, and the doctors were too busy to handle it. Some doctors thought the work was too heavy, they couldn't handle it, the pay was too low, and it was better to transfer out. In response to the above situation, we took the following five measures:

First, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "class struggle, once grasped, is effective," we firmly grasped class struggle and mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to expose and combat the disruptive activities of class enemies.

Second, we organized doctors and poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's instructions on medical work, study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and combine them with reminiscing about past sufferings and comparing the present with the past to conduct class education. This raised everyone's understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian medical line, strengthened the class love among the poor and lower-middle peasants, corrected their attitudes towards unified medical care, and educated and helped doctors gradually establish a revolutionary spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

Third, we mobilized doctors and poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct a comprehensive investigation of common, frequent, and universally existing diseases in the entire commune, mastering the patterns of disease outbreaks throughout the year. On this basis, we organized the masses to launch a people's war on preventive work, such as collecting traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, building well platforms, cleaning up environmental sanitation, eliminating the "four pests," adjusting toilets and pits, and conducting regular health inspections and evaluations by the commune and brigades.

Fourth, we trained health personnel at the brigade and production team levels, ensuring that each brigade has a midwife and each production team has a health worker. We used them as the backbone to continuously organize the masses to learn health knowledge, gradually fostering the good habit of every family loving cleanliness and everyone practicing hygiene.

Fifth, we improved the management system for medical expenses. For diseases that can be treated within the commune, we do not go outside for treatment; for diseases that cannot be treated within the commune, we apply to the commune for approval to be treated outside, with medical expenses covered by the commune. For diseases that can be solved with traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, we insist on using traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions; for diseases that can be treated with acupuncture, we do not use medication. By promoting traditional Chinese medicine in this way, we not only saved money but also treated the diseases well. Through the above efforts, our commune's unified medical care system has been sustained.

Three years of practice have proven that unified medical care is a good method. It fully embodies the superiority of the socialist collective economy. The problem of community members seeing doctors and taking medicine has been solved, and they no longer need to worry about birth, old age, sickness, and death. Their confidence in walking the socialist road and persisting with the collective economy has been further strengthened, and their love for Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the new society has deepened. Because we have seriously implemented the principle of prevention first, the number of diseases among community members has decreased, their physical fitness has improved, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has increased, which has greatly promoted the development of production. In addition, it has played a significant role in strengthening the class feelings among the poor and lower-middle peasants and promoting the ideological transformation of medical personnel. Three years of practice has made us deeply realize that the key to implementing and persisting with unified medical care lies in arming and educating the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian medical line. Only in this way can we put the power of health in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, repel the sabotage of class enemies, and resist bourgeois ideology and various old habits and forces.

### 我们是怎样坚持合作医疗制度的？

    我们是怎样坚持合作医疗制度的？
    我们的五项具体措施：一、发动群众打击阶级敌人的破坏活动；二、组织贫下中农和医务人员活学活用毛主席关于卫生工作的指示；三、调查常见病、多发病的情况，开展群众性预防工作；四、培训大队和生产队的卫生人员；五、多用土药方和针灸治病，推广中医中药。
    湖北省长阳县乐园公社的合作医疗制度好得很，它体现了毛主席的革命卫生路线，指出了农村卫生医疗工作的方向，完全符合我们贫下中农的心愿，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持。
    我们公社的医疗制度和乐园公社的医疗制度略有不同，但大方向是一致的。贫下中农称俺公社的医疗制度为“统筹医疗”。一九六五年底到一九六六年初，我们根据毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示，在贫下中农的积极赞助下，从我们公社的具体情况出发，实行了全公社的统筹医疗制度。具体办法是：以生产队为单位，每人每年从生产队公益金中拿出两元五角，作为医疗费用，由公社集中管理使用。社员看病吃药就不要花钱了，只是每次看病时花五分钱挂号费。地、富、反、坏、右分子不享受统筹医疗的待遇。公社医院的医生实行固定工资，从医疗费中开支。
    毛主席指出：“整个社会主义阶段，存在着阶级和阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争是长期的、复杂的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”我们公社实行和坚持统筹医疗制度的过程，就是一场尖锐的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的过程，也是毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线的胜利过程。统筹医疗制度实行以后，引起了阶级敌人的极端仇视和破坏，他们有的扬言说：“这个办法是兔子的尾巴长不了。”有的煽动群众说：“还不如把钱分到社员手里，谁想看就看，不想看就散。”在阶级敌人的煽动下，有一小部分社员人口少、经济条件好、又很少生病的，认为自己吃了亏，动摇了。还有一些社员认为这下子有办法了，不论大病小病，都往医院跑，勤看病，要好药，钱花的多，医生也忙不过来。有的医生认为工作重，干不了，拿钱少，不如调出好。针对以上情况，我们采取了五项措施：
    一、根据毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，狠抓了阶级斗争，发动贫下中农揭露和打击了阶级敌人的破坏活动。
    二、组织医生和贫下中农大学毛主席关于卫生工作的指示，大学“老三篇”，结合启发大家忆苦思甜，回忆对比，进行阶级教育，提高大家对毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线的认识，增强贫下中农之间的阶级友爱感情，端正对统筹医疗的态度，教育和帮助医生逐步树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的革命精神。
    三、发动医生和贫下中农对全公社的常见病、多发病、普遍存在的病进行全面的调查，掌握了一年四季发病的规律。在此基础上，组织群众开展预防工作的人民战争，如搜集土药方，修建井台，打扫环境卫生，除四害，调整厕所、沤池，公社和大队定期进行卫生检查、评比等。
    四、培训大队和生产队卫生人员，做到了大队有接生员，生产队有卫生员，并以他们为骨干，不断组织群众学习有关卫生常识，逐步养成家家爱清洁，人人讲卫生的良好习惯。
    五、健全医疗费用的管理制度。凡是本公社能治的病，不出去治；本公社无法治的，经公社批准转往外地治，医疗费由公社负担。凡是用土药方能解决问题的，就坚持用土药方；凡是用针灸能治好的，就不吃药。这样推广中医中药的结果，既少花了钱，又看好了病。经过上述努力，我们公社的统筹医疗制度就坚持了下来。
    三年来的实践证明，统筹医疗是个好办法，它充分体现了社会主义集体经济的优越性，社员看病吃药的问题解决了，生老病死的问题不必担忧了，对走社会主义道路、坚持集体经济的信心进一步增强了，对毛主席，对共产党，对新社会，更加热爱了。由于认真贯彻了预防为主的方针，社员的病减少了，体质增强了，革命干劲更大了，有力地促进了生产的发展。此外，对于增强贫下中农之间的阶级感情，促进医务人员的思想革命化，也起了显著的作用。三年来的实践使我们深深体会到：实行和坚持统筹医疗，关键在于用毛泽东思想、用毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线去武装群众，教育群众，这是根本的根本。只有这样，才能把卫生大权掌握在贫下中农手里，才能打退阶级敌人的破坏，也才能抵制资产阶级思想和各种旧的习惯势力。
