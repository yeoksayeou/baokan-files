A vast movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines is surging forward in Sichuan. The 70 million military personnel and civilians in the entire province have received profound education on the struggle between the two lines, heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and swiftly launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly spoken about. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," was issued, revolutionary cadres and masses in cities and countryside throughout Sichuan immediately sprang into action, launching a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. The Sichuan Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army Chengdu Command successively organized a large number of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which went deep into the vast rural areas and, through various forms, organized and led the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to study. Factories, villages, streets, schools, and agencies throughout the province all held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the main content of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. From cities to countryside, a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice quickly formed.

Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in various places, in studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, carried forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, closely linked the actual struggle between the two lines in their own regions, units, and departments, and their own personal experiences, using the method of recalling and comparing, extensively discussing factory history, village history, and family history, greatly enhancing the broad revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. In places like Yibin, Neijiang, Fuling, and Leshan, during the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, mass meetings were held to thoroughly criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' heinous crimes of betraying the party and the nation, thoroughly criticize the "February Countercurrent" of 1967 and the evil wind this spring to reverse the verdict on the "February Countercurrent," and eliminate its poison. Through criticism, the broad masses deeply realized that the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines is centered on the issue of power. If power is in the hands of the proletariat, it can ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, ensure that our party and country forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the socialist revolution to the end. If power falls into the hands of the bourgeoisie, the people will suffer, the country will change nature, and capitalism will be restored. The broad revolutionary masses firmly declared that they must closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to unify thought, step, and action, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and consolidate and develop the proletarian power with actual actions.

Through studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad revolutionary masses have an even deeper love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and a deeper hatred for the running dogs of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi and his agents. With deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, the broad revolutionary masses launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. Peasants in vast rural people's communes set up battlefields for criticism everywhere, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of slashing cooperatives and advocating "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms" in an attempt to restore capitalism. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi once visited factories and communes in cities and counties like Chengdu, Zigong, and Pixian, and the broad revolutionary masses in these units have an even deeper hatred for Liu Shaoqi. They used the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by Liu Shaoqi, thoroughly eliminating its poison.

The study of the history of the struggle between the two lines has promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice in the entire province to a new high tide. The broad revolutionary masses are more conscious than ever before in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, always taking Chairman Mao's teachings as the criterion, and promoting the struggle-criticism-transformation to develop in depth. In places like Mianyang, Neijiang, Leshan, Chengdu, and Zigong, many factories, rural communes, agencies, and schools mobilized the masses to launch fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies, exposing a batch of deeply hidden counter-revolutionaries, and accurately and resolutely striking a handful of class enemies.

    用毛泽东思想统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动
    四川七千万军民深入学习两条路线斗争史
    全省迅速掀起了革命大批判和斗、批、改的新高潮
    新华社成都电　波澜壮阔的两条路线斗争史的学习运动正在四川深入发展。全省七千万军民受到了深刻的两条路线斗争教育，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，迅速掀起了革命大批判和斗、批、改的新高潮。
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”发表后，四川全省城乡广大革命干部和群众立即行动起来，展开了两条路线斗争史的学习运动。四川省革命委员会和人民解放军成都部队相继组织了大量毛泽东思想宣传队，深入广大农村，通过各种形式，组织领导广大贫下中农进行学习。各地工厂、农村、街道、学校、机关都举办了以学习两条路线斗争史为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。从城市到农村，很快形成了一个人人学习两条路线斗争史的活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。
    各地的工人和贫下中农在学习两条路线斗争史中，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，紧紧联系本地区、本单位、本部门的两条路线斗争实际，联系自己的亲身经历，采取回忆对比的办法，大讲厂史、村史、家史，极大地提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。宜宾、内江、涪陵、乐山等地区，在学习两条路线斗争史中，都召开了群众大会，彻底批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行，彻底批判一九六七年的“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风，并肃清其流毒。通过批判，使广大群众深刻认识到，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的中心是政权问题，政权掌握在无产阶级手里，就能保证毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，保证我们党和国家永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义革命进行到底。政权如果落在资产阶级手里，人民就要遭殃，国家就要变质，资本主义就会复辟。广大革命群众坚定地表示，一定要紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，以实际行动巩固和发展无产阶级的政权。
    通过学习两条路线斗争史，广大革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱、无限忠诚，对帝、修、反的走狗刘少奇及其代理人更加仇恨。广大革命群众怀着对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。广大农村人民公社社员到处摆开大批判的战场，狠批刘少奇大砍合作社、鼓吹“三自一包”“四大自由”，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。大叛徒刘少奇曾经到过成都、自贡、郫县等市、县的一些工厂、公社放过毒，这些单位的广大革命群众对刘少奇更是万分仇恨，他们以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭狠批了刘少奇所散布的反革命修正主义黑货。彻底肃清其流毒。
    两条路线斗争史的学习，推动全省活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮。广大革命群众比以往任何时候都更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，处处事事以毛主席的教导为准则，推动了斗、批、改向纵深发展。绵阳、内江、乐山、成都、自贡等地区，许多工厂、农村公社、机关和学校放手发动群众，向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，挖出了一批隐藏很深的反革命分子，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
