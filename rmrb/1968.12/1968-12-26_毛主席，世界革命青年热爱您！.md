Chairman Mao, revolutionary youth around the world love you!

Mao Zedong,
You are the Lenin of our time,
We salute you!
Mao Zedong,
You are the greatest teacher of our age,
You are the leader of the struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world!
It is you who have spread the voice of freedom and liberation around the globe,
...

This is a song full of revolutionary spirit written by a foreign young friend, praising our greatest leader of the proletarian revolution in contemporary times, Chairman Mao, and praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It expresses the deepest feelings of revolutionary youth around the world for Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! From Beijing to Tirana, from Asia, Africa to Latin America, across the five continents, how many revolutionary youth think of you day and night! How many revolutionary youth wear your badge on their chest, hang your portrait on the wall, and send your works to the front lines of the struggle!

In our brotherly country of Albania, young people regard obtaining a Chairman Mao badge as a great honor. A young peasant received a Chairman Mao badge from a Chinese comrade and said: "This is not only my happiness but also the honor of our entire village. I will take the Chairman Mao badge back to let the whole village share this happiness."

In the home of an African student studying in France, we saw the walls covered with portraits and poems of the great teacher Chairman Mao. This friend said that he thinks day and night about being able to go to Beijing to visit Chairman Mao. He said: "I also know that this wish is not easy to fulfill immediately. So I cut out all the portraits of Chairman Mao from various Chinese magazines and hung them on the wall, so I can see Chairman Mao every day."

Revolutionary youth around the world regard being received by the great leader Chairman Mao as their greatest happiness. Vietnamese youth comrades from the south who have been received by Chairman Mao said: "Chairman Mao's reception is a great support and encouragement for the anti-American revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. In the future struggle, whenever we think of Chairman Mao's reception, we can overcome any difficulty and defeat all enemies."

Last year, a Bolivian youth who saw our great leader Chairman Mao said: "This is the greatest happiness of my life. This is not only my personal honor but also the honor of Bolivian youth. Millions of people look up to Chairman Mao, yearning to see Chairman Mao, and I was able to see Chairman Mao and shake hands three times, this is the most unforgettable thing in my life. The great image of Chairman Mao will forever remain in my memory, forever inspiring me to fight for the liberation of the Bolivian people."

"Dear Mao Zedong—I call your name with reverence, you are the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.... The time has come: every revolutionary on our planet should study your works, just as they study the works of Ilyich Lenin." This is a letter from a young Soviet teacher. He broke through the heavy blockade of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to express the reverence of the great Soviet people and youth with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution for the great leader Chairman Mao.

How many foreign revolutionary youth, with reverence and happiness in their hearts, crossed mountains and rivers to come to our country, visited Shaoshan, and wrote moving poems. A young friend from Honduras wrote in "Ode to Shaoshan":

Shaoshan!
I sing for you with all my heart,
Singing for you, the hope of the people,
Singing for you, inspiring the suffering people to strive for early liberation!

Shaoshan!
You are like a bright lighthouse,
Illuminating the direction of the world's people's advance.
Shaoshan! You are so blessed,
On your land, a red sun that never sets has risen.
The red sun is Mao Zedong.
Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!
We cheer for you a thousand times!
We sing for you a thousand times!
So many people,
They crossed the ocean,
Heart after heart,
Flying to your side!
Ah! Sacred land,
The red sun of Beijing,
I will sing for you forever, sing,
Sing with all my heart!

Apply Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary struggle in one's own country

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Thousands of words cannot express the admiration of revolutionary youth from various countries for you, thousands of songs cannot express the faith of revolutionary youth from various countries in your thought. Last year, a French youth who came to China excitedly said: "We came to study Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse of world revolution." They just arrived and requested to organize a study group of Chairman Mao's works with our accompanying personnel. They said: "Chairman Mao's Little Red Book has greatly helped the French revolutionary people, although imperialism and revisionism have blocked Mao Zedong Thought, but the truth still spreads to France through Chairman Mao's Little Red Book. We must study it well and apply it to our future struggle."

Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our times. Many young friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America said that as long as the oppressed people grasp this sharpest weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, combine it with their own country's reality, and go through their own struggle, they will definitely achieve liberation. A Dominican youth said:

"Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on armed seizure of power, people's war, class struggle, and self-reliance are the spiritual wealth of revolutionary people." A Congolese (Brazzaville) young friend said: "Chairman Mao has enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the oppressed peoples of various countries to struggle for liberation. The truth that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' pointed out by Chairman Mao is unshakable. Oppressed peoples must achieve liberation by following Chairman Mao's words."

Chairman Mao's teachings on the necessity for intellectuals to combine with workers and peasants have pointed out the correct direction for the revolutionary youth movements of various countries. Many revolutionary youths of various countries, after studying Chairman Mao's works, firmly went to factories, to the countryside, to the front lines of the fiery revolutionary struggle. A Latin American youth, after visiting China, went back and went with his friends to the workers and peasants, saying: "We saw that the masses' consciousness is very high, we learned a lot from them, poor peasants all want to take up arms to fight."

Hail the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China

Revolutionary youth around the world, together with us, cheer for the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, cheer for the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Last year, an Ivorian youth who visited China said: "The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has greatly inspired us. We place all our hopes in China, the hearts of the people of the world yearn for Beijing, yearn for Chairman Mao." A Dominican youth friend said: "China has helped our liberation struggle in all aspects, and the greatest help is Mao Zedong Thought."

Many revolutionary youth friends said that exposing the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi is a great joy for the revolutionary people of the world. A French youth who visited our country said: "Liu Shaoqi is too bad, if Liu Shaoqi is not exposed, it will affect the world revolution. Criticizing Liu Shaoqi is a great cause for the revolutionary people of the world. Liu Shaoqi's black 'How to Be a Good Communist' also has poison in France, we also need to criticize. Criticizing Liu Shaoqi is criticizing revisionism, it is defending Mao Zedong Thought, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts will forever illuminate the path of revolutionary youth around the world, guiding them to charge into the old world. Recently, we received a letter from an African youth worker, describing how he was unjustly arrested by the reactionary authorities for actively participating in the workers' and students' movements, and how he studied Chairman Mao's works in prison, fighting bravely and tenaciously against the enemy. The letter said: "The reactionaries have used all their tricks, trying to conquer me. But as Chairman Mao said, 'lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' they exposed themselves. In the hard days in prison, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Our comrades must see achievements and light in difficult times, and raise our courage.' This is the greatest encouragement for me. I do not regret being imprisoned for a just struggle, I shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' in the prison."

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your brilliant image, your voice, your thoughts, your revolutionary line, forever inspire the revolutionary youth of the world to march forward bravely!

### 毛主席，世界革命青年热爱您！

专栏：

    毛主席，世界革命青年热爱您！
    毛泽东，
    您是当代的列宁，
    我们向您致敬！
    毛泽东，
    您是我们时代最伟大的导师，
    您是世界被压迫人民斗争的旗手！
    是您，把自由解放的声音传遍全球，
    ……
    这是一位外国青年朋友写的一首充满革命豪情的颂歌，歌颂我们当代最伟大的无产阶级革命领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。它表达了全世界革命青年对毛主席的最真挚的感情。
  毛主席是当代最伟大的
  马克思列宁主义者
    毛主席啊，毛主席！从北京到地拉那，从亚洲、非洲到拉丁美洲，五洲四海，多少革命青年日日夜夜想念您！多少革命青年把您的像章佩戴在胸前，把您的像片挂在墙上，把您的著作传送到斗争的最前方！
    在我们的兄弟之邦阿尔巴尼亚，青年们把得到一枚毛主席像章看成是极大的光荣。有位农村青年从中国同志手里得到了一枚毛主席像章，他说：“这不仅是我一个人的幸福，而且是我们全村人的光荣。我要把毛主席像章带回去，让全村的人共同分享这个幸福。”
    在一个非洲留法学生的家里，我们亲眼看到墙上挂满了伟大导师毛主席的像片和诗词。这位朋友说，他白天黑夜都在想，能有一天到北京去看望毛主席。他说：“我也知道，这个愿望一下难以实现。所以我就把中国各种杂志上的毛主席的像片都剪下来，挂在墙上，这样可以天天看见毛主席。”
    世界革命青年把伟大领袖毛主席的接见，看作是自己的巨大幸福。曾经受到毛主席接见的越南南方青年战友们说：“毛伯伯的接见，这是对我们越南人民和全世界人民反美革命斗争的巨大支持和鼓舞。在今后的斗争中，只要我们想起毛主席的接见，就能克服任何困难，战胜一切敌人。”
    去年，一位玻利维亚青年见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席后说：“这是我一生中最大的幸福。这不仅是我个人的荣誉，也是玻利维亚青年的荣誉。亿万人民仰望毛主席，渴望能见到毛主席，而我能见到毛主席并握了三次手，这是我一生中最难忘的事。毛主席的伟大形象，将永远留在我的记忆里，将永远鼓舞着我为玻利维亚人民的解放事业而斗争。”
      “亲爱的毛泽东——我以崇敬的心情称呼您的名字，您是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。……这样的时候来到了：我们地球上的每一个革命者都应该学习您的著作，就象学习伊里奇·列宁的著作一样。”这是一位苏联年轻教师的来信。他冲破了苏修叛徒集团的重重封锁，表达了具有十月革命光荣传统的伟大苏联人民和青年对伟大领袖毛主席崇敬的感情。
    多少外国革命青年，怀着崇敬和幸福的心情，越千山，跨万水，来到我国，访问韶山，写下了一篇篇动人的诗歌。一位来自洪都拉斯的青年朋友在《韶山颂》里写道：
      韶山啊！
    我为你纵情歌唱，
    歌唱你，人民的希望，
    歌唱你，鼓舞着受苦的人民争取早日解放！
      韶山啊！
    你好象一座明亮的灯塔，
    照亮了世界人民前进的方向。
    韶山啊！你多么幸福，
    在你的土地上，升起了永远不落的红太阳。
    红太阳就是毛泽东。
    毛泽东啊，毛泽东！
    我们千百次向您欢呼！
    我们千百次向您歌唱！
    多少人，
    他们远涉重洋，
    一颗颗火热的心，
    飞向您的身旁！
    啊！神圣的土地，
    北京的红太阳，
    我要永远为您歌唱，歌唱，
    纵情歌唱！
  把毛泽东思想运用于
  本国的革命斗争实践
    毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语表达不了各国革命青年对您的崇拜，千歌万曲表达不了各国革命青年对您思想的信仰。去年，一位法国青年到中国后激动地说：“我们是来学习毛泽东思想的。毛泽东思想是世界革命的灯塔。”他们刚到就要求和我陪同人员一起组织毛主席著作学习小组。他们说：“毛主席的红宝书对法国革命人民帮助很大，尽管帝国主义、修正主义封锁毛泽东思想，但真理还是通过毛主席的红宝书传到法国去了。我们要好好学习，应用到我们今后的斗争实践中去。”
    毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜。许多亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲青年朋友们说，只要我们被压迫人民掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，结合本国的实际，经过自己的斗争，就一定能得到解放。一位多米尼加青年说：
  “毛主席有关武装夺取政权、人民战争、阶级斗争和自力更生等光辉思想，是革命人民的思想财富。”刚果（布）青年朋友说：“毛主席丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想是各国被压迫人民争取解放的强大思想武器。毛主席指出的‘枪杆子里面出政权’是颠扑不破的真理，被压迫人民要取得解放就必须照毛主席的话去办。”
    毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农相结合的教导，给各国革命青年运动指出了正确的方向。许多国家的革命青年学习了毛主席的著作，就坚定地到工厂去，到农村去，到火热的革命斗争前线去。一位拉丁美洲青年访华回去后，和他的朋友们一起到工人、农民中去，他说：“我们看到群众觉悟非常高，我们从他们那里学到了许多东西，贫苦农民都要求拿起枪来干。”
  欢呼中国无产阶级
  文化大革命的伟大胜利
    全世界革命青年和我们一起，同声欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。去年，访问过中国的象牙海岸青年朋友说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，使我们受到了巨大的鼓舞。我们把希望都寄托在中国，世界人民的心都向往北京，向往毛主席。”一位多米尼加青年朋友说：“中国从各方面援助我们的解放斗争，而对我们最大的援助是毛泽东思想。”
    许多革命青年朋友们说，揪出叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇是世界革命人民的一件大喜事。到我国访问的法国青年说：“刘少奇太坏了，不把刘少奇揪出来就会影响世界革命。批判刘少奇是世界革命人民的一件大事，刘少奇的黑《修养》在法国也有流毒，我们也要批判。批判刘少奇就是批判修正主义，就是保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”
    毛主席的光辉思想永远照亮世界革命青年前进的道路，指引着他们向旧世界冲锋陷阵。最近我们收到了一位非洲青年工人的来信，叙述他由于积极参加工人和学生运动，被反动当局无理逮捕，他在监狱中活学活用毛主席著作，同敌人进行英勇顽强的斗争。来信说：“反动派耍尽阴谋诡计，妄想征服我。但正如毛主席所说‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，暴露了他们自己。我在监狱艰苦的日子里想到了毛主席的教导：‘我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。’这对我说来是最有力的鼓舞。我对因为从事正义斗争而被关进监狱一点不觉得遗憾，我在那里高呼毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的光辉形象，您的声音，您的思想，您的革命路线，永远鼓舞着世界革命青年奋勇向前！
