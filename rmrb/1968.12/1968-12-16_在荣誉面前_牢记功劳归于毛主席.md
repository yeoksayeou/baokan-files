Party branch deputy secretary and women's federation chairperson Song Liying said: When honor comes, one must be careful not to become arrogant. In recent years, Dazhai has become famous, with tens of thousands of people visiting every day, shouting, "Learn from Dazhai people." Initially, when Dazhai cadres heard this slogan, some shouted, "Learn from the comrades"; others remained silent but felt delighted. After the party branch discovered this issue, they organized a discussion: To whom does the honor belong? Whose credit should it be? Everyone said, "Dazhai's growth is entirely due to Mao Zedong Thought. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no new Dazhai. The credit goes to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Since then, whenever people shout, "Learn from Dazhai people," we respond with, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" This loudest of slogans, we shout it thousands and tens of thousands of times, and it still cannot fully express our Dazhai poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Team deputy head Jia Laiheng said: A revolutionary, amidst praise, does not need "Good! Good! Good!" but rather needs to remember the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Chairman Mao said, "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, which is Marxism-Leninism. We can eliminate bad work styles and maintain good work styles." In practicing Chairman Mao's instructions, we deeply feel that the poor and lower-middle peasants' criticism of cadres is the greatest care for cadres. The more the poor and lower-middle peasants dare to criticize us, the closer our hearts are connected. If one fears criticism, work cannot progress. The earlier the masses' opinions are raised, the faster the cadres' shortcomings are corrected, and the fewer mistakes there are in work. We are serving the people, so we cannot fear the masses' criticism. Those who have been exposed as a handful of capitalist roaders are like tigers whose butts cannot be touched; because of their different stance, they cannot accept any opinions from the masses. We have overthrown them, but we must never contract even a bit of the stink of being untouchable tigers. We must humbly accept the masses' criticism. In Dazhai, the more praise we hear, the more our cadres proactively seek criticism from the masses. Of course, malicious attacks from class enemies are another matter. In front of the people, we are "old yellow oxen," but we must engage in a head-on struggle against class enemies.

### 在荣誉面前  牢记功劳归于毛主席

    在荣誉面前  牢记功劳归于毛主席
    党支部副书记、妇代会主任宋立英说：荣誉高了，要千万防止翘尾巴。这几年大寨的名声大了，每天有成千上万的人到大寨参观，口口声声喊：“向大寨人学习。”起初，我们大寨干部听到这个口号声，有的喊：“向同志们学习”；有的不吭声，心里乐滋滋的。党支部发现这一问题后，组织大家讨论：荣誉究竟归于谁？功劳应该记给谁？大家说：“大寨的成长全靠毛泽东思想，没有毛泽东思想就没有新大寨。功劳归于毛主席，归于毛泽东思想，归于毛主席的革命路线。”从这以后，每当人们喊：“向大寨人学习”时，我们就高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”这一最响亮的口号，我们喊千遍万遍，也还不能完全表达出我们大寨贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜的无产阶级感情。
    大队副大队长贾来恒说：一个革命者，在一片赞扬声中，需要的不是“好！好！好！”而重要的是不要忘记批评和自我批评的武器。毛主席说：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”在执行毛主席这一教导的实践中，我们深深体会到：贫下中农对干部的批评，是对干部的最大爱护。贫下中农越敢批评我们，越说明我们和贫下中农的心连得紧。如果怕批评，工作就不能前进。群众的意见越提得早，干部的缺点越改得快，工作中的错误就越少。我们是为人民服务的，就不能怕群众批评。现在已经被揪出来的一小撮走资派，他们都是老虎屁股摸不得；因为立场不同，他们听不进群众半点意见。我们革了他们的命，自己可万万不能沾染一点老虎屁股摸不得的臭毛病，一定要虚心听取群众的批评。在大寨，越是听的赞扬声多的时候，我们的干部越主动去向群众征求批评意见。当然，对于来自阶级敌人的恶意攻击，那是另一回事。我们在人民群众面前是“老黄牛”，对于阶级敌人就要进行针锋相对的斗争。
