Revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and PLA soldiers supporting agriculture in Hou Shi Commune, Dongfeng County, Jilin Province, are using the communiqué as a weapon to severely criticize the reactionary fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" advocated by Liu Shaoqi. They have declared that they will follow the great leader Chairman Mao for life and continue the revolution.
