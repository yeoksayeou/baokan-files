The revolutionary model opera *The Red Detachment of Women* vividly depicts the heroic deeds of 18 injured and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army, who, with the support of the revolutionary masses of Shajia Village, annihilated the pseudo-army. It passionately sings the praises of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the people's army and people's war, vividly expresses the deep affection between the people's army and the revolutionary masses, and profoundly embodies the great truth that "the army and the people are as one, who can defeat us?" This is a vivid picture of the army loving the people and the people supporting the army, a family of soldiers and civilians united as one. It is a magnificent poem of supporting the army and loving the people.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." In *The Red Detachment of Women*, the political instructor Guo Jian'guang and the other 18 injured and sick soldiers take Chairman Mao's great teachings as their guiding principle for all actions. From them, the essence of our army, which is "completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the interests of the people," is fully manifested. In the scene "Transfer," when the political instructor Guo Jian'guang and the soldiers come to Shajia Village to recuperate, they think about how to quickly liberate the suffering laboring people. Therefore, they "day and night hope to be healthy and strong" to "raise their arms and wield their swords to slay the wolves." In the scene "Persist," it more specifically reflects the deep class feelings of the people's army loving the people. When they hear the gunshots across the river, they immediately think, "the villagers and fellow villagers will be in trouble," and thus, one by one, "class hatred and national hatred burn in their chests." To quickly annihilate the traitors and Japanese bandits, they are willing to endure all hardships and persist in the struggle. "Eight thousand storms cannot blow it down, nine thousand thunderbolts cannot bomb it," fully expressing their boundless loyalty to the people, love for the people, and determination to annihilate the enemy.

The stage depiction of the army loving the people is a true reflection of reality. The image of Guo Jian'guang on the stage is a prominent representative of countless model soldiers who love the people. Watching this play, one naturally thinks of the heroic scenes of our company extinguishing the fire on Jigong Mountain this year, and of the four martyrs, Wang Youkang, Xu Tongyao, Wang Huankin, and Ning Fulian, who sacrificed their lives to rescue the people's property in this battle. The heroic images of Guo Jian'guang and other soldiers created on the stage are so similar to the heroic deeds of our company's deputy political instructor Wang Youkang and others! We feel that the heroes on the stage are as if they are among our ranks, and Guo Jian'guang is as if he is leading us, inspiring us to better serve the people.

The people's army comes from the people and fights for the people. This army will inevitably receive the sincere support of the people. *The Red Detachment of Women* successfully created models like A Qing and Grandma Xia. In the scene "Transfer," when Grandma Xia hears that the New Fourth Army is leaving, she immediately shows the deep concern and care of a revolutionary old mother for the soldiers of the people: "Comrades who have fought and been wounded, Shajia Village is your home. If the villagers have any negligence, I will go and criticize them." In the scene "Rebuke the Enemy," Grandma Xia, in the face of the murderous demon Hu Chuanhui and Qiao Deyi, does not think of her personal safety, but rather, "it is fortunate that our relatives have escaped danger, even if I am torn to pieces, I am willing." To protect the 18 injured and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army, this old mother with white hair not only does not care for her own safety but also sacrifices her only son. She truly regards the soldiers of the people as more precious than her own flesh and blood. Through these scenes, one cannot help but respect this revolutionary old mother. In the history of the revolutionary struggle, how many such revolutionary old mothers there are! They have contributed their strength, their children, and everything they have. The fruits of today's revolutionary victory are condensed with their precious blood, and their revolutionary spirit will never be forgotten by us. Comrade A Qing is another brilliant image in *The Red Detachment of Women*. She is the organizer and leader of the people of Shajia Village, standing at the forefront of the struggle, shouldering the heavy responsibility of the revolution, and showing great wisdom and courage. She regards the 18 injured and sick soldiers as her closest people. She ties her fate to theirs, sharing life and death, and bonding like flesh and blood. In addition, ordinary people like Wang Fugen, to cover up the injured and sick soldiers, remain steadfast in the face of the enemy's severe torture, and ultimately sacrifice heroically. The revolutionary masses of Shajia Village have written a magnificent poem of supporting the army with their blood and lives.

Shajia Village, this model collective of supporting the army, represents the boundless love of the billion people of the country for the soldiers of the people. Looking back at the battle history of our company since its establishment during the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the personal command of great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, from the banks of the Songhua River to the shores of the South China Sea, we have traversed countless mountains and rivers, stayed in thousands of villages and towns. Whether in the years of war or in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we have always received the greatest support from the broad masses of the people. In real life, there are countless good villagers like A Qing and Grandma Xia! At the beginning of this year, in the battle to extinguish the mountain fire with our company and the people, there were many moving stories of supporting the army. The forest farm director Chen Pinpu, who fought side by side with us, saw that the deputy political instructor Wang Youkang was surrounded by the fire, and immediately led a few forest farm workers to rush into the fire, bravely rescuing him. The local people, knowing that some of our comrades were injured in the fire-fighting, rushed to visit and comfort them, showing great care for the soldiers of the people. Watching the excellent play *The Red Detachment of Women*, thinking of the countless chapters of supporting the army and loving the people in real life, it strengthened our resolve to always take root among the people, unite closely with the people, and better serve the people.

The unity of the army and the people is strength, the unity of the army and the people is victory! In the past, we relied on the unity of the army and the people to defeat the Japanese bandits, overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and liberate all of China; today, we must prevent revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and even more so strengthen the unity of the army and the people. Only by strengthening the unity of the army and the people can we strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must cherish the unity of the army and the people as we cherish our own eyes and constantly raise the level of army-people relations to new heights.

Not long ago, the Central Military Commission conferred the honorable title of "Model Company for Loving the People" on our company. This is the greatest care, the greatest education, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for us. We are determined to take Guo Jian'guang and the other 18 injured and sick soldiers in *The Red Detachment of Women*, and our company's four martyrs, Wang Youkang and others, as examples, to raise high the great banner of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People," and to constantly achieve new victories for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    拥军爱民的壮丽诗篇——看革命样板戏《沙家浜》

　战士　廖应文
    革命样板戏《沙家浜》，通过描写新四军十八个伤病员在沙家浜革命群众的支持下消灭伪军的英雄事迹，满腔热情地歌颂了毛主席关于人民军队和人民战争的光辉思想，生动地表达了人民军队和广大革命人民群众的鱼水深情，深刻地体现了“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”的伟大真理。这是一幅军爱民、民拥军，军民团结一家人的生动图画，是一首拥军爱民的壮丽诗篇。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”《沙家浜》中的指导员郭建光等十八个伤病员，把毛主席的这一伟大教导作为一切行动的准则。从他们身上，充分地体现了我军“完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”革命军队的本质。在“转移”一场，来到沙家浜养伤的指导员郭建光和战士们想的是如何迅速地把受苦受难的劳动人民解救出来。所以，他们“日夜盼望身健壮”，好早日“奋臂挥刀斩豺狼”。在“坚持”一场，更具体地反映了人民军队无限热爱人民的深厚阶级感情，当他们听到对岸枪声响，就马上想到“村镇上乡亲们要遭祸殃”，因而，一个个“阶级仇民族恨燃烧在胸膛”。为了尽快地消灭汉奸和日本狗强盗，他们宁可忍受一切困难，坚持斗争。“八千里风暴吹不倒，九千个雷霆也难轰”，充分抒发了他们无限忠于人民、热爱人民的思想感情，表达了他们消灭敌人的坚强战斗决心。
    舞台上描绘的军爱民的动人情景，是现实生活的真实反映。舞台上的郭建光的形象，就是千万个爱民模范的突出代表。看了这出戏，很自然地想起我们连在今年扑灭鸡公山大火时的壮烈情景，想起在这次战斗中为了抢救人民财产而英勇牺牲的王幼康、许统耀、王焕金、宁福连四位烈士。舞台上塑造的郭建光和其他战士的英雄形象，同我们连副指导员王幼康等同志的英雄事迹是何等相似啊！我们觉得舞台上的英雄就好象在我们的队伍中间，郭建光就好象走在我们前头，激励我们更好地为人民服务。
    人民军队来自人民，为了人民。这支军队就必然受到人民群众真心实意的拥护。《沙家浜》成功地塑造了阿庆嫂、沙奶奶这样一些拥军模范。在“转移”一场，当沙奶奶听说新四军要走，立即表现出一位革命老妈妈对人民子弟兵无比爱护和关切的心情：“同志们杀敌挂了花，沙家浜就是你们的家，乡亲们若有怠慢处，说出来我就去批评他”。在“斥敌”一场，沙奶奶在杀人魔王胡传葵、刁德一面前，想的不是个人安危，而是“且喜亲人已脱险，粉身碎骨也心甘”。为了保护新四军十八个伤病员，这位满头白发的老妈妈不但不顾自己的安危，还把自己唯一的儿子也献了出来，真正做到了把人民子弟兵看得比自己的亲骨肉还重。通过这些场面，不能不引起我们对这位革命老妈妈肃然起敬。在革命斗争史上，有多少这样的革命老妈妈啊！她们献出了自己的力量，献出了自己的子女，献出了自己的一切，今天的革命胜利果实，凝集着她们宝贵的心血，她们的革命精神使我们永远不能忘记。共产党员阿庆嫂是《沙家浜》中的又一光辉形象。她是沙家浜群众的组织者和领导者，站在斗争的第一线，肩负着革命重担，表现了大智大勇。她把十八个伤病员看作是自己最亲最亲的人。她把自己的命运和他们紧紧连结在一起，生死与共，骨肉相连。此外，象普通群众王福根，为了掩护伤病员，在敌人的严刑拷打面前，坚贞不屈，最后英勇牺牲，沙家浜革命群众用鲜血和生命谱出了拥军的壮丽诗篇。
    沙家浜这个拥军模范的集体，是全国亿万人民无限热爱子弟兵的代表。回顾我们连从抗日战争时期成立以来的战斗历程，我们在伟大领袖毛主席和林副主席的亲自指挥下，从松花江畔到南海之滨，踏过千山万水，驻过万寨千村，无论是在战火纷飞的年代，还是在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，我们都得到过广大人民群众的最大支持。现实生活中到处都有象阿庆嫂、沙奶奶这样的好乡亲！今年年初，在我们连队和人民群众一道扑灭山火的战斗中，就有许多拥军的动人事迹。和我们并肩战斗的林场队长陈品谱，看到副指导员王幼康被大火包围时，就毫不犹豫地带领几个林场工人冒着生命危险冲进火海，奋力抢救。当地人民群众知道我们有些同志在灭火中负了伤，便纷纷赶来看望、慰问，对人民子弟兵关怀备至。看了《沙家浜》这出好戏，联想起现实生活中许许多多的拥军爱民的战斗篇章，加强了我们永远扎根于群众之中，和群众紧密团结，更好地为人民服务的决心。
    军民团结就是力量，军民团结就是胜利！过去，我们靠军民团结，打败了日本强盗，推翻了蒋家王朝，解放了全中国；今天，我们要防修、反修，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，更要加强军民团结。只有加强军民团结，才能加强无产阶级专政。我们一定要象爱护自己的眼睛一样，爱护军民团结，不断地把军民关系提高到新的水平。
    不久前，中央军委授予我们连“爱民模范连”的光荣称号，这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的教育，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。我们决心以《沙家浜》中的郭建光等十八位伤病员和我们连王幼康等四位烈士为榜样，更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，为巩固无产阶级专政，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利不断地立新功！
