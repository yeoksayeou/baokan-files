The revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Refinery, inspired by the great encouragement of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, have focused on revolution and promoted production. By the end of November, they completed one month ahead of schedule and exceeded the state's annual production plan for gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil, the four major types of products.

Since this year, under the guidance of the series of latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary workers of this factory, with their profound proletarian feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have displayed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. In the process of striving to complete this year's annual production plan ahead of schedule, they have launched three waves of revolution and production promotion, achieving three victories in three battles with bountiful results. When the revolutionary workers launched the first wave of revolution and production promotion, the higher authorities were demanding that they complete a batch of important product production tasks in a short period. At that time, the main difficulties were poor equipment, lack of experience, and short time. The leaders of the revolutionary committee of the factory took this problem to the grassroots level, stayed in the teams, and together with the revolutionary workers, studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, carried out revolutionary criticism, conducted investigations and research, and formulated measures to complete the tasks. Through revolutionary criticism, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply expose and criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's "expert management," "technology first," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, greatly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary workers. At the same time, the factory revolutionary committee organized a technical breakthrough team with excellent industrial workers as the main body, fully mobilized the masses, and collectively solved one technical difficulty after another in the production process. After a few days of battle, they successfully completed this task.

Soon, the annual major overhaul began. In the past, each year's major overhaul would take one to two months, seriously affecting the normal progress of production. This year's major overhaul was the first major overhaul since the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee and the first major overhaul after the revolutionary workers seized the technical power from a handful of reactionary technical "authorities." The revolutionary workers continued to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, raising their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness in the criticism. At the same time, they actively proposed rationalization suggestions, launched technical innovation and technological revolution movements. The revolution promoted production, and the broad revolutionary workers were full of vigor and fighting spirit, completing this overhaul ten days ahead of schedule and one month ahead of previous years. The completion of the overhaul ahead of schedule created good conditions for exceeding the state's production plan.

After two victories, the factory revolutionary committee timely called on all revolutionary workers of the factory to strive for every moment, wage a decisive battle in the last four months of this year, and resolutely complete the arduous task of the four major types of products. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory carried forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous battle. After dispatching a large number of excellent workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to lead the struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure, the revolutionary workers who remained in the factory bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, and production saw a significant increase. Entering November, all workers of the factory, inspired by the great encouragement of the communiqué of the expanded 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, were full of fighting spirit and doubled their efforts, finally completing one month ahead of schedule and exceeding the state's annual production plan for gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil, the four major types of products.

    革命职工遵循毛主席的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产
    兰州炼油厂提前完成四大类产品生产任务
    新华社兰州电　兰州炼油厂革命职工，在党的八届十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在十一月底提前一个月超额完成了汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油四大类产品的全年国家生产计划。
    今年以来，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，这个厂的广大革命职工以无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，在争取提前完成今年全年生产计划的过程中，掀起了三次抓革命促生产的高潮，取得了三战三捷的丰硕战果。革命职工掀起第一次抓革命促生产高潮时，上级正要求他们在短时间内完成一批重要产品的生产任务。当时的主要困难是设备差，经验不足，时间又短。厂革委会领导成员就带着这个问题，深入基层，蹲点到班组，和革命职工一道学习毛主席的有关教导，一起开展革命大批判，一起调查研究，制订完成任务的措施。在革命大批判中，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，深入揭发、批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，使广大革命职工大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。同时，厂革委会还组织了以优秀产业工人为主体的技术攻坚队，充分发动群众，群策群力，解决了生产过程中的一个个技术难关。经过几天的战斗，终于出色地完成了这项任务。
    不久，一年一度的大检修开始了。过去，每年的大检修都要折腾一两个月时间，严重地影响了生产的正常进行。今年的大检修，是厂革委会成立以来的第一次大检修，也是革命职工从一小撮资产阶级反动技术“权威”手中夺回技术大权后的第一次大检修。革命职工继续深入开展革命大批判，在大批判中提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，同时积极提合理化建议，开展技术革新和技术革命运动。革命推动了生产，广大革命职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，使这次大检修比原计划提前十天、比往年提前一个月完成了任务。大检修工程的提前完成，为超额完成国家生产计划创造了良好条件。
    在两战两捷以后，厂革委会又及时号召全厂革命职工以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，大战今年的最后四个月，坚决完成四大类产品的艰巨任务。全厂革命职工发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，在抽调大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑领域领导斗、批、改后，留厂革命职工勇挑革命、生产两副重担，生产又有了大幅度提高。进入十一月份，全厂职工在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，干劲倍增，终于提前一个月超额完成了汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油四大类产品的全年国家生产计划。
