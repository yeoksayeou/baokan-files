I have worked in a public primary school for several years and have personally witnessed and experienced the harm caused by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line on us teachers. For instance, some teachers do not want to integrate with workers and peasants, and are detached from the masses. Some teachers cannot distinguish between different grains and the teachers who teach agricultural production knowledge only know how to talk but not how to do. Due to long-term detachment from productive labor, even when occasionally participating in labor, they cannot put down the airs of intellectuals.

Liu Shaoqi also uses various means to corrupt the teaching staff, preventing teachers from following the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and advocating for seeking fame and personal gain. Under this ideological poisoning, some teachers spend all day thinking about becoming famous and establishing a family, sitting in rooms to engage in "inventions" and writing "papers." Teachers in old schools learn capitalist methods and teach students in a rigid manner. After graduation, students do not want to return to the countryside. What is even more serious is that the school takes many measures to restrict the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Just take the issue of tuition fees as an example: the school does not care about the hardships of poor and lower-middle peasants, but instead imposes tuition collection tasks, implementing what is called "tuition over-fulfillment reward." If the task is not completed, teachers' salaries will be deducted. If the children of poor and lower-middle peasants do not have money to pay the tuition, they will not be allowed to enroll, or books will not be issued, or report cards will not be issued, and they may not even be allowed to advance to the next grade. In our school, there is a son of a poor peasant named Mao Jianxiang, who was forced to drop out just before graduation because he had no money to pay the tuition.

I am the daughter of a poor peasant and a Communist Party member. Why did I not firmly resist the school's exclusion of the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from enrolling? It is because I was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Liu Shaoqi said, "The main task of teachers is to complete their teaching plans." Under this fallacy, I buried myself in studying my profession, throwing proletarian politics behind my back, and was indifferent to the persecution of my class brothers and sisters. I buried myself in the circle of my profession because of my own selfishness. I thought that if my profession was good, I could be promoted to the position of director or principal, and a good profession could transfer me from a general primary school to a central or experimental primary school, and I could also be promoted and receive a salary increase. These are all the poisons of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Most or a large majority of students trained in old schools can integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them even have inventions and creations, but they need to be under the correct leadership and re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the way for us intellectuals who came out of old schools. I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, sincerely accept the re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and like the poor and lower-middle peasants, with deep proletarian feelings, diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in collective production labor, thoroughly reform my thoughts, and wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    接受贫下中农的再教育
    立坝小学教师　缪永美
    我在公办小学里工作好几年了，亲眼看到和受到刘少奇推行反革命修正主义教育路线对我们教师的毒害。如有的教师不愿和工农结合，脱离群众。有的教师五谷不分，教农业生产常识的教师只会讲不会做。由于长期脱离生产劳动，有时偶尔参加生产劳动，也放不下知识分子的架子。
    刘少奇还用种种手法腐蚀教师队伍，不让教师走与工农兵相结合的道路，鼓吹追名求利，个人至上。在这种思想毒害下，有的教师一天到晚想成名成家，坐在房子里搞“创造发明”，写“论文”。教师在旧学校学的是资本主义的一套，教学生也是死搬硬套，学生毕业后不想回农村。尤其严重的是，学校采取许多措施来限制贫下中农子女。就拿缴费问题来说，不关心贫下中农的疾苦，硬下达收费任务，搞什么学费超成奖，如果不能完成任务，就扣教师的工资。贫下中农子女如果没有钱缴费，就不准报名，或者不发书，或者不发成绩报告单，甚至不能升学。我校有个贫农的儿子叫毛健祥，就是因为无钱缴费，结果在毕业前夕被迫停学。
    我是贫农女儿，又是共产党员，看到学校排斥贫下中农子女入学，为什么没有坚决抵制呢？就是因为受了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害。刘少奇说：“教师的主要任务就是完成自己的教学计划”。在这种谬论的毒害下，我就埋头钻研业务，把无产阶级政治抛在脑后，对自己的阶级兄弟姐妹受到迫害也漠不关心。我把自己埋在业务圈子里，也是由于自己的“私”字作怪。我认为业务好了，可以提拔为教导主任、校长，业务好可以从一般小学调到中心小学或实验小学，还可以晋级加薪。这些都是中的刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想的毒。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的最新指示，为我们从旧学校出来的知识分子指明了道路。我一定牢记毛主席的教导，真心实意地接受工农兵的再教育，象贫下中农那样，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，积极参加集体生产劳动，彻底改造思想，全心全意地为贫下中农服务。
