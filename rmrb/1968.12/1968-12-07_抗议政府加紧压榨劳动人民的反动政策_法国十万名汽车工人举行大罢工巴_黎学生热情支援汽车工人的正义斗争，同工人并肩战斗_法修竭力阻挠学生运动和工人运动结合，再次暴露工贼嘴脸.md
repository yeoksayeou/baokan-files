Paris, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) — More than 100,000 workers at Renault, France's largest state-owned automobile company, went on strike on Dec. 5 to protest the French government's reactionary policies of exploiting the working people and to demand immediate wage increases in the face of soaring prices. Paris students enthusiastically supported the Renault workers' just struggle, participating in their demonstrations and fighting side by side with the workers.

To save the franc, which is on the brink of collapse amid the new storm of the Western financial crisis, the French government recently implemented a series of so-called "austerity" measures, including increased taxation and wage freezes, which have led to further price hikes and worsened the living conditions of the working people. This has sparked strong resentment among French workers. Renault workers, who played a leading role in the massive strikes that swept France in May and June, have once again taken the lead in the struggle, strongly protesting the government's intensified exploitation of the working people, despite the government's recent threats to suppress "all disturbances and demonstrations."

On Dec. 5, more than 100,000 workers at Renault's five factories in Boulogne-Billancourt, Cléon, Sandouville, Le Mans, and Flins went on strike. In Boulogne-Billancourt, on the outskirts of Paris, 5,000 to 6,000 Renault workers, after holding a protest rally, broke through the police lines and marched out of the factory gates, holding a demonstration on the streets.

Many students traveled from Paris to Boulogne-Billancourt to enthusiastically support the Renault workers' struggle. The students held a rally in front of the factory to express their solidarity with the workers. After the rally, the students sang "The Internationale" and chanted slogans such as "Workers and students unite in the same struggle," "This is just the beginning, let's continue the fight," and marched with the workers in the demonstration.

The French ruling class, which has been in disarray due to the recent franc crisis, is extremely fearful that the Renault workers' strike will once again ignite a wildfire of mass struggle. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou summoned the head of the French Communist Party-affiliated General Confederation of Labor, Georges Séguy, for a secret talk. Séguy, after the meeting, obsequiously declared: "The General Confederation of Labor strongly supports the government's economic balance plan. We do not intend to put the country back in the situation of May." To serve the interests of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie, the French Communist Party has done everything in its power to limit and sabotage the workers' struggle and to prevent the student movement from uniting with the workers' movement. In addition to trying to pressure Renault workers to shorten their strike, the French Communist Party's union leaders, on Dec. 5, under the pretext of not allowing "outside interference," prevented a large number of university students who had traveled from Paris to Boulogne-Billancourt to support the workers' struggle from entering the factory to participate in the Renault workers' protest rally. The French Communist Party's shameless actions have once again exposed their traitorous and scab-like nature, drawing strong condemnation from progressive French workers and students.

    新华社六日讯　巴黎消息：法国最大的汽车垄断企业——国营雷诺汽车公司的十万多名工人，五日举行罢工，抗议法国政府加紧压榨劳动人民的反动政策，要求在法国目前物价飞涨的情况下马上提高工资。巴黎学生热情支持雷诺工人的正义斗争。他们积极参加了工人的示威游行，同工人并肩战斗。
    法国政府为了挽救在西方金融危机新风暴冲击下摇摇欲坠的法郎，最近采取了增加税收、冻结工资等一系列向劳动人民转嫁困难的所谓“紧缩”措施，使得法国物价进一步高涨，劳动人民生活更加困苦。这激起了法国工人强烈的不满。在今年五、六月席卷法国的大罢工斗争中起了带头作用的雷诺汽车公司工人，不顾法国政府最近扬言要镇压“一切骚动和示威”的威胁，再次带头进行斗争，对政府加紧向劳动人民开刀的作法表示强烈的抗议。
    五日，雷诺汽车公司在巴黎郊区布洛涅—比扬古以及在克莱翁、桑杜维尔·勒芒和弗兰等地的五个工厂的十万多名工人举行了罢工。在巴黎郊区布洛涅—比扬古，五、六千名雷诺汽车公司的工人在举行抗议大会以后冲破警察的防线，走出了工厂大门，在大街上举行了示威游行。
    许多学生专程从巴黎赶到布洛涅—比扬古，热情地支持雷诺工人的斗争。学生们在工厂前的广场上举行了声援工人斗争的大会。会后，学生们高唱《国际歌》，高呼“工人和学生在同一斗争中联合起来”，“这仅仅是开始，让我们继续斗争下去”等口号，同工人们一起举行了示威游行。
    被最近的法郎危机弄得狼狈不堪的法国统治集团，异常害怕雷诺工人的罢工会再次燃起群众斗争的燎原大火。法国总理德姆维尔为此召见了法修工会头目塞居伊进行了密谈。塞居伊在会谈后奴颜婢膝地宣称：“总工会很支持（政府的）经济平衡”计划，“我们不打算使国家重新陷入五月间的处境”。为了替法国垄断资产阶级效劳，法修千方百计地限制和破坏工人的斗争，阻挠学生运动同工人运动相结合。法修的工会头目除了极力压雷诺工人缩短罢工时间以外，五日还借口什么不许“外界干涉”，不让大批从巴黎赶到布洛涅—比扬古来支援工人斗争的大学生进入工厂参加雷诺工人的抗议大会。法修集团的这些无耻的行径又一次暴露了它们的工贼和叛徒的丑恶面目，遭到法国进步工人和学生的严正斥责。
