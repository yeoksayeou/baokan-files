After Chairman Mao issued the brilliant directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," our brigade established a health clinic, and each production team also had health workers. Doctors from the health center regularly taught the health workers, achieving some success. However, under the control of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line, this training of health workers could not be sustained. It was three days of work followed by two days of rest, and eventually, it was completely halted. Therefore, even for common infectious diseases like epidemic influenza in children, it was difficult to provide treatment.

In accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching to "actively prevent and treat the illnesses of the people and promote the people's medical and health undertakings," I suggest that we vigorously train young people who come from good backgrounds, are dedicated to serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, and actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to become rural health workers. They should be able to master the treatment and prevention of common diseases and learn to use scientific folk remedies. By cultivating medical and health personnel in this way, we can provide better conditions for implementing the cooperative medical system in rural areas.

    大力培训农村卫生员
    毛主席发出“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的光辉指示后，我们大队建立了卫生室，各生产队也都有了卫生员。卫生所医生定期给卫生员上课，取得了一定成绩。但是在刘少奇的反革命修正主义卫生路线统治下，这件培训卫生员的事情没有能够坚持下来，三天打鱼，两天晒网，后来干脆中断了。因此，小孩得了流行性感冒等一般传染病，也很难医治。
    根据毛主席“应当积极地预防和医治人民的疾病，推广人民的医药卫生事业”的伟大教导，我建议把出身好、热心为贫下中农服务、活学活用毛泽东思想的青年，大力培训成为农村的卫生员，让他们能够掌握一般疾病的治疗和预防方法，帮助他们懂得使用合乎科学的土方。这样培养医务卫生人材，就为农村实行合作医疗制度提供了更好的条件。
