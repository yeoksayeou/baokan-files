More than one million two hundred thousand industrial workers in Shanghai, while deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, have deeply felt that actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have combined the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, effectively promoting a new leap in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 24th — More than one million two hundred thousand industrial workers in Shanghai, following the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, through in-depth study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, have continuously raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, further promoting the revolutionization of thought, and powerfully promoting the vigorous development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, as well as production, on all fronts.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "The experience of history is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be frequently and repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must all know," was issued, the heroic Shanghai working class acted swiftly and decisively, immediately launching a widespread and in-depth movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. Workers in the metallurgy, machinery, chemical, light industry, textile, instrument, and handicraft industries have all set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, they closely combined the practice of the struggle between the two lines, enthusiastically praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fiercely criticizing the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

In the process of deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the Shanghai working class repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, linking it with the decades-long battle history of the Chinese revolution, especially with the actual struggle between the two classes and two lines in the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They further clarified the boundaries between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and loved the great leader Chairman Mao even more, and loved the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin even more. They said, the entire history of our party is the history of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line defeating the erroneous lines of Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and the reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi. Every victory we have achieved is a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Workers from many factories such as the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, and Shanghai No. 22 Textile Mill recalled with immense emotion the happy scenes when the great leader Chairman Mao inspected the factory. Many workers who shook hands with the great leader Chairman Mao at that time excitedly said: Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and relies on the masses the most. Chairman Mao is heart-to-heart with us workers. We are heart-to-heart with Chairman Mao. We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao and will defend Chairman Mao to the death! The workers of these factories also angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roaders within the party, Liu Shaoqi, poisoning the factory. In 1958, Liu Shaoqi ran to Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, instructing the capitalist-roaders in the factory not to let the workers study Chairman Mao's works, and absurdly saying that "politics in command is doing specific work." The steel workers said, whenever this matter is mentioned, our lungs burst with anger! Chairman Mao is our supreme commander, and Chairman Mao's works are our supreme instructions. We will study Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good workers for Chairman Mao!

Actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for advancing along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is another important realization of the Shanghai working class in the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines. They deeply realized that the most powerful weapon in the struggle between the two lines is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines has promoted the vigorous development of the mass movement to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought on the Shanghai industrial front. Directing all actions with Mao Zedong Thought has become the first need of Shanghai workers' lives. Many factories have established unshakable study systems. Workers, with the problems in the history of the struggle between the two lines, study how Chairman Mao teaches, how the great traitor Liu Shaoqi poisons, how the capitalist-roaders in their own units act, and how they themselves think, before class, during class, and after class. Workers return home and study with their family members. Some units' workers even brought the capitalist-roaders in their factory to the family area, linking these fellows with Liu Shaoqi for struggle and criticism, thus both criticizing and exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line and raising everyone's awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Many revolutionary workers in Shanghai, in the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, paid great attention to linking it with their own thought reality, thoroughly breaking down the bourgeois "self," and establishing the proletarian "public," better promoting the revolutionization of thought. They deeply felt that to firmly defend and loyally execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one must break down the "self" and establish the "public." Only when the "public" is in command can one ensure steadfastly advancing along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The members of the revolutionary committee of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, while repeatedly reviewing Chairman Mao's great instructions, "We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impatience, and we must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle," linked it with their own experiences since taking power, saying, we revolutionary communists taking power must always remember Chairman Mao's instructions, forever maintaining the styles of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, no impatience, and hard struggle, to forever advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the process of deeply carrying out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the Shanghai working class generally adopted three methods:

First, learning while following. That is, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions once, lecturing on the history of the struggle between the two lines once. They realized that studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the best and most vivid education on the struggle between the two lines. After each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is issued, many factories immediately set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making the broad masses of workers universally receive education on the struggle between the two lines.

Second, learning while struggling. That is, grasping the prevalent active thoughts, linking them with the central work of a period, deeply and thoroughly criticizing one of Liu Shaoqi's black viewpoints, and raising the broad masses of workers' awareness of the struggle between the two lines. This way, it ensures that the revolutionary criticism goes deep and lasts, and provides a large amount of rich and vivid teaching materials for deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines.

Third, repeatedly learning and always lecturing. That is, timely grasping the new things, new thoughts, and new trends appearing in the struggle between the two lines, conducting repeated propaganda, and through grasping the seedlings, setting up models, continuously conducting lively and vivid education on the struggle between the two lines for the broad masses of workers. Many factories, in the process of carrying out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, have emerged with many advanced figures, and they quickly spread and promoted them through methods such as holding lectures on the use of Mao Zedong Thought, broadcasting meetings, and setting up big-character poster columns.

Currently, the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, which is continuing to deepen, has powerfully promoted the deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation on the Shanghai industrial front. The broad revolutionary masses have closely combined the in-depth study of the history of the struggle between the two lines with seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own factories and units, learning, struggling, criticizing, and transforming simultaneously. Many factories have also made great achievements in cleaning up class ranks, rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, and transferring office staff. The deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation has further promoted the new leap in industrial production, with various factories' production flourishing, and reports of completing the annual production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target continuously coming in.

    用毛泽东思想指挥自己的一切行动
    上海一百二十万产业工人在深入学习两条路线斗争史中，深深体会到，活学活用毛泽东思想，是沿着毛主席革命路线胜利前进的根本保证。他们把学习两条路线斗争史，同本单位的斗批改结合起来，有力地推动了生产的新跃进
    新华社上海二十四日电　上海一百二十万产业工人紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，通过深入学习两条路线斗争史，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步促进了思想革命化，有力地推动了各条战线斗、批、改和生产的蓬勃发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表后，英雄的上海工人阶级雷厉风行，立即掀起了广泛深入的两条路线斗争史的学习运动。冶金、机电、化工、轻工、纺织、仪表和手工等行业的广大革命职工，纷纷办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他们紧密结合两条路线斗争的实践，热情赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。
    上海工人阶级在深入学习两条路线斗争史的过程中，反复学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，联系中国革命几十年的战斗历程，特别是联系两年多来无产阶级文化大革命中两个阶级、两条路线斗争的实际，更进一步地划清了毛主席无产阶级革命路线和刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的界限，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加热爱以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。他们说，我们党的全部历史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明右的或“左”的错误路线，战胜以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线的斗争史，我们取得的每一个胜利，都是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利。上海第一钢铁厂、上海电机厂、上海第二十二棉纺织厂等许多工厂的工人，以无比激动的心情回忆了伟大领袖毛主席来厂视察时的幸福情景。许多在当年和伟大领袖毛主席握过手的工人激动地说：毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众。毛主席和我们工人心连心，我们和毛主席亲又亲。我们永远忠于毛主席，誓死捍卫毛主席！这些厂的工人还愤怒地声讨了党内头号走资派刘少奇到本厂放毒的滔天罪行。一九五八年刘少奇跑到上钢一厂，指使这个厂的走资派，不准工人们学毛主席著作，胡说什么“政治挂帅就是做具体工作”。炼钢工人说，一提起这件事，我们肺都气炸了！毛主席是我们的最高统帅，毛主席著作是我们的最高指示。我们要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好工人！
    活学活用毛泽东思想，是沿着毛主席无产阶级革命路线胜利前进的根本保证，这是上海工人阶级在两条路线斗争史学习中的又一个重要体会。他们深刻地认识到，进行两条路线斗争的最强大的武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。两条路线斗争史的学习运动，推动着上海工业战线活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的蓬勃发展。用毛泽东思想来指挥自己的一切行动，已成为上海工人生活的第一需要。许多工厂都建立了雷打不动的学习制度。工人们带着两条路线斗争史中的问题，看毛主席是怎么教导的，大叛徒刘少奇是怎么放毒的，本单位走资派是怎么做的，自己是怎么想的，班前学习，班中议论，班后检查。工人们回到家里，还和自己的亲属一起学习。有的单位的工人还把本厂走资派揪到家属区，把这些家伙同刘少奇挂起钩来进行批斗，这样既批臭了反革命修正主义黑线，又提高了大家的两条路线斗争觉悟。
    上海许多革命职工在两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，很注意联系自己的思想实际，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，更好地促进思想革命化。他们深有体会地说，要坚定捍卫和忠实执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，必须破私立公。只有“公”字挂了帅，才能保证坚定不移地沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇向前。上钢三厂革委会的同志们在反复重温毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的伟大教导时，联系自己掌权以来的体会说，我们无产阶级革命派掌权，只有时刻牢记毛主席的教导，永远保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁和艰苦奋斗的作风，才能永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。
    上海工人阶级在深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，普遍地采用了三种做法：
    一是在紧跟中学。就是学一次毛主席最新指示，讲一次两条路线斗争史。他们认识到，学习毛主席最新指示，是最好最生动的两条路线斗争教育。毛主席每一条最新指示发表后，许多工厂都立即办起各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，使广大工人普遍受到两条路线斗争的教育。
    二是在斗争中学。就是抓住带有普遍性的活思想，结合一个时期的中心工作，批深批透刘少奇的一个黑论点，提高广大工人的两条路线斗争觉悟。这样做，既保证了革命大批判深入持久地开展，又为深入学习两条路线斗争史提供了大量丰富生动的教材。
    三是反复学，时时讲。就是及时抓住在两条路线斗争中出现的新事物、新思想、新动向，进行反复宣传，通过抓苗子，树典型，对广大工人群众不断进行活的、生动的两条路线斗争教育。许多工厂在开展两条路线斗争史学习运动中，涌现了不少先进人物，他们就通过开讲用会、广播会、出大字报专栏等办法，迅速加以传播和推广。
    目前，正在继续深入开展的两条路线斗争史的学习运动，有力地推动了上海工业战线斗、批、改的深入发展。广大革命职工把深入学习两条路线斗争史，同认真搞好本厂和本单位的斗、批、改紧密结合起来，边学、边斗、边批、边改。许多工厂在清理阶级队伍、整党、精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员等方面，也都做出了巨大的成绩。斗、批、改的深入发展，又推动了工业生产的新跃进，各工厂生产蒸蒸日上，提前超额完成全年生产计划的喜报不断传出。
