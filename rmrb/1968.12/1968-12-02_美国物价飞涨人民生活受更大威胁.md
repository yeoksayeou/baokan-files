		U.S. domestic inflation is becoming increasingly severe, with prices rising rapidly, posing a greater threat to the livelihoods of the broad masses of working people.

		According to official figures released by the United States, the cost of living index rose by 0.6 percent in October, the highest monthly increase in over six years. In the first ten months of this year, the U.S. cost of living index has risen by more than 4 percent, higher than the annual rate of price increases in any of the 17 years since 1951.

		Official figures show that retail prices for various commodities have generally risen, with the prices of necessities for the working people rising even more sharply. Among these, the prices of clothing and transportation have risen by 0.9 percent each. The actual purchasing power of the working people has been further weakened compared to September. U.S. Labor Department officials admit that there is no sign of the price increase trend abating.
