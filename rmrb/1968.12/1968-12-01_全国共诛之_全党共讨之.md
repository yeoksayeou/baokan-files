The traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi, in April 1963, took his wife Wang XX to Indonesia. Together with the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indonesian reactionary politicians, they engaged in many dirty deeds. This old counter-revolutionary shamelessly declared, “I served as the president of Indonesia for nine days.” He and his wife proudly produced the extremely reactionary documentary “Visiting Indonesia.”

“I served as the president of Indonesia for nine days”—this is a clear admission, fully exposing Liu Shaoqi’s evil plot to usurp the party and the country.

Liu Shaoqi, this great schemer, has long opposed our great leader Chairman Mao. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, he absurdly claimed that the party’s leader “has not actually formed for a long time.” After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he shamelessly shouted: “Chairman Mao can also be opposed.” After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, he continuously viciously attacked our great leader Chairman Mao, even to the point of arrogantly demanding that Chairman Mao “step down” and “yield.” He is truly a heinous criminal deserving of a thousand deaths!

This loyal lackey of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries is so frantically opposed to our great leader Chairman Mao precisely because he wants to usurp the party and the country to realize his dream of becoming a bourgeois “president.”

“A tiny ant shaking a tree is impossible.” This number one capitalist-roader in the party, who dreams of being “president,” has finally been dragged onto the judgment seat of history by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led personally by our great leader Chairman Mao.

Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: “Chairman Mao is the founder of our party, the founder of the Chinese revolution, the great leader of our party and state, and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.” Our great leader Chairman Mao will forever be the reddest sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought will forever be our lifeline. The facts prove: all our achievements are the result of Chairman Mao’s wise leadership, and all our victories are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is our mortal enemy. The whole nation condemns them, and the whole party demands their punishment. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, forever be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

Today, as we settle accounts with the traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi’s heinous crimes of betraying the party and the country, we are even more clear: under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the main enemy of the proletariat is the capitalist-roader in power within the party; the focus of class struggle is the issue of power. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and conduct a thorough and deep-going revolutionary criticism and repudiation. We must completely overthrow and expose Liu Shaoqi, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 全国共诛之　全党共讨之

    全国共诛之　全党共讨之
    解放军某部战士　邓坚荣
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇于一九六三年四月带着他的老婆王××到印度尼西亚，同美帝、苏修以及印尼反动政客臭味相投，干了不少肮脏事。这个老反革命恬不知耻地宣称：“我在印尼当了九天总统”。还和他老婆洋洋自得地炮制了《访问印度尼西亚》这部反动透顶的纪录片。
    “我在印尼当了九天总统”——这真是不打自招，充分暴露了刘少奇妄图篡党篡国的罪恶阴谋。
    刘少奇这个大野心家，长期以来，一贯地反对我们伟大的领袖毛主席。早在抗日战争时期，他就胡说什么全党的领袖“很久没有实际的形成”。抗日战争胜利后，他又丧心病狂地叫嚣：毛主席也“可以反”。中华人民共和国成立后，他又不断地恶毒攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，甚至猖狂到要毛主席“下台”“让位”。真是罪大恶极，罪该万死！
    这个帝、修、反的忠实走狗，所以如此疯狂地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，就是为了篡党篡国，以实现他当资产阶级“总统”的黄粱梦。
    “蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。这个一心想当“总统”的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，终于被亿万革命群众揪上了历史的审判台。
    林副主席教导我们：“毛主席是我们党的缔造者，是我国革命的缔造者，是我们党和国家的伟大领袖，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”伟大领袖毛主席永远是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想永远是我们的命根子。事实证明：我们的一切成就都是毛主席英明领导的结果，我们的一切胜利都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。谁反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的死敌，全国共诛之，全党共讨之。我们要以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    今天，我们清算大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行，更使我们认清楚：在无产阶级专政的条件下，无产阶级的主要敌人就是混进党内的走资本主义道路当权派；阶级斗争的中心是政权问题。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的战斗任务，持久深入地进行革命大批判，把刘少奇彻底批倒、批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
