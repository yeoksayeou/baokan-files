The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the vast land of our motherland. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized among the 700 million people of our country. The sunlight and rain of Mao Zedong Thought nourish the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses. On the vast land of our great socialist motherland, vivid examples of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice emerge every day.

Struggle Against the "Private" Thought

As the struggle-criticism-transformation movement deepens in factories, the revolutionary workers of Qingdao No. 7 Cotton Mill have become even more conscious in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, constantly engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism. They fiercely struggle against the "private" thought that flashes in their minds, revolutionizing their souls.

Sun Jianxin, a young female worker in the Spinning Section, is a pioneer in revolution and a skilled worker in production. She ties knots quickly, and her production volume is the highest in the entire section.

One day, she tied a bad knot. She thought: I tie thousands of knots a day. One bad knot doesn't matter. I can increase my production volume, and no one will know. The section doesn't have a dedicated inspector now, so no one will find out. I can just be more careful next time. But then she looked up and saw Chairman Mao's portrait and his quote on the machine: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by our Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is a people's army. It is an army that is completely for the people and completely serves the people's interests." She thought: Now that we, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, are in power, we have smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, and abolished the inspection system that oppressed and controlled workers. We, the working class, are truly the masters now. We should be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, devote ourselves to the public, and serve the people completely and thoroughly. I, for the sake of production volume, didn't handle the bad knot, which goes against the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings. She further thought: I think that handling a bad knot secretly is fine because no one will know, and only the high production volume will be seen. Isn't this falling into the trap of Liu Shaoqi's "public in form, private in essence" theory? The more she thought, the more embarrassed she felt. She quickly went back and handled the bad knot.

"I can't just secretly fix it and be done with it. Secretly fixing it means secretly making mistakes." Sun Jianxin decided to expose her "private" thoughts to her comrades, using Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely struggle against them, and let her comrades help her correct them thoroughly. Therefore, she recounted her thought struggle process in handling the bad knot in detail and conducted a serious self-criticism at the "Three Loyalties" activity evaluation meeting, which was loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Her fellow group members all said: "Xiao Sun's self-criticism awareness is indeed high." Sun Jianxin, by constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely struggle against the "private" thought that flashes in her mind, greatly promoted her ideological revolutionization. She has always been at the forefront of the struggle to seize revolution and promote production in the section.

### 狠斗“私”字一闪念

    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照祖国大地
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在我国七亿人民中得到了空前的大普及。毛泽东思想的阳光雨露滋润着广大革命人民群众的心田，在我们伟大社会主义祖国的辽阔土地上，每天都有大量活学活用毛泽东思想的生动事例涌现出来。
    狠斗“私”字一闪念
    随着工厂斗、批、改的深入发展，青岛国棉七厂的广大革命工人更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，时时、处处斗私批修。他们狠斗“私”字一闪念，灵魂深处闹革命。
    筒摇成车间青年女工孙建新，论革命，她是闯将；讲生产，也是能手。她打结快，全车间数她产量高。
    有一天，她打了一个坏结头，心里想：我一天生产要打五六千个结头，出一个坏结头算不了什么，多提高点产量就有了。现在车间又不设专人检查，没人知道，以后注意就行了。可是，她一抬头看见了车头上挂着的毛主席像和毛主席语录：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”她想：现在我们无产阶级革命派掌权，粉碎了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，废除了管、压、卡工人的检查制度，我们工人阶级真正当家作主了，就应该无限忠于毛主席，一心为公，对工作要做到“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。自己为了赶产量，出了坏结头不处理，就是违背了伟大领袖毛主席的教导。她又进一步想到：我觉得处理一个坏结头谁也不知道，产量高了大家才能看得到，这不是中了刘少奇“大公有私”论的毒吗？她越想脸上越发烧，就赶紧回过头来处理了那个坏结头。
    “不能这样偷偷地改了就算了，偷偷地改，还要偷偷地犯。”孙建新下决心向同志们亮一亮自己的“私”字，用毛泽东思想狠狠斗一斗，让同志们帮助彻底改正。于是，她又在忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动讲评会上，原原本本地讲了自己在处理一个坏结头时的思想斗争过程，认真地进行了自我批评。小组同志们都说：“小孙自我批评的自觉性就是高。”孙建新由于经常用毛泽东思想狠斗“私”字一闪念，大大地促进了思想革命化，她在抓革命、促生产的斗争中一直走在车间的前列。
