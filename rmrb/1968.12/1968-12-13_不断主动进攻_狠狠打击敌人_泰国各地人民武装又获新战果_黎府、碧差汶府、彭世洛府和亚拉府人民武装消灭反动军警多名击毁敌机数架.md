The people's armed forces in various parts of Thailand under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand have recently launched a series of fierce attacks against the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique, achieving new victories.

The radio station reported that since early December, the people's armed forces in Langsue County, Lamphun Province, have been continuously initiating attacks and striking the enemy hard. They shot down and damaged four helicopters of the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique, destroyed two military vehicles, and burned down an enemy "command center" and an "office" of a concentration camp.

Since December 3, the people's armed forces in Lamphun Province have surrounded a group of reactionary military police of the U.S.-Thanom clique, occupied advantageous positions, and actively struck the enemy. On December 8, the people's armed forces in Lamphun Province launched another fierce attack on the enemy's parked helicopter fleet, causing heavy losses to the enemy and achieving a great victory.

The people's armed forces in Phetchabun Province have also recently launched multiple consecutive attacks and ambushes against the enemy. On December 3, the people's armed forces bravely attacked the reactionary military police, wounding four enemies. On the same day, the people's armed forces ambushed the enemy, killing one enemy soldier. Recently, they also attacked an enemy stronghold, wounding two enemies and damaging a helicopter of the U.S.-Thanom clique that was sent to rescue them.

Following the glorious victory of destroying an enemy camp and annihilating more than ten enemies last month, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Thayi County, Phetchabun Province, have continued to launch multiple attacks and ambushes against the enemy. On December 4 alone, the people's armed forces ambushed the reactionary military police twice, annihilating five enemies.

On December 4, the people's armed forces in Yala Province in the south also bravely ambushed the reactionary military police of the U.S.-Thanom clique.
