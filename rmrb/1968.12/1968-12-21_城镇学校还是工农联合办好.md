Editor's Note: Since the discussion on "How should urban primary and secondary schools be run?" began, many revolutionary masses have written in to discuss the issue of how urban schools should be run, and we hope readers will also express their opinions on this matter. For some urban schools that have already implemented reforms according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and have gained some initial experience, we hope they will discuss their experiences in conjunction with their own practices.

Should Urban Schools Be Run by Workers and Farmers Together?

The workers of the Tractor Parts Factory in Yanji City, Jilin Province, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching that the working class must lead everything, sent a worker propaganda team to the Yan'an Primary School in early October this year, taking full control of the school's educational power. Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, the Yan'an "May 7th" Revolutionary School Revolutionary Committee, with workers as the main body, was established to lead the school's entire struggle, criticism, and reform.

Two months of practice have fully demonstrated the superiority of the working class leading the school.

However, in the process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th" instructions, a practical problem arose. The Tractor Parts Factory is a factory with only over 300 people, while the Yan'an Primary School has over 1,700 students. It is difficult for such a small factory to manage so many students and to regularly organize students to participate in the factory's labor. What should be done?

During the discussion, someone suggested that the factory should set up attached workshops and workshops, but there are many specific problems that are difficult to solve, and it is not possible to fully implement Chairman Mao's great teaching that students should "study as the main task, learn other things as well, that is, not only study literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie." Someone else suggested expanding the school's existing farmland. But this method is also not good. Teachers have deep feelings about this: "In the past, the school also had farmland, but because we did not come into contact with poor and lower-middle peasants, we did not receive re-education and tempering, and we farmed just for the sake of farming."

How should it be done then? Everyone looked for the answer in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's teaching is like a beacon lighting up the hearts of the workers. They said, in a city like Yanji, factories, production teams, and schools are closely connected, workers and farmers live in the same town, and the students trained will not all become workers in the future, but mainly go to the countryside to the vast world, so why not invite the poor and lower-middle peasants to come and manage the school together? The understanding was unified, and the workers went to the nearby production brigade to seek the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants on jointly running the school. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very happy and said: "In the past, Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line caused students to be ignorant of the five grains and only dream of promotion and wealth. Let us and the working class manage the school together, this is something we should do."

The working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants are heart to heart. After negotiation and discussion, it was decided that the Yan'an "May 7th" Revolutionary School would be jointly run by the Tractor Parts Factory and the Changbai Commune Yanhe Production Brigade, establishing a revolutionary committee for education that combines workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students. The worker representative serves as the director, and the poor and lower-middle peasant representative serves as the deputy director, ensuring that the educational power of the school is firmly in the hands of the proletariat.

The advantages of workers and farmers jointly running the school are:

1. Factories and villages are everywhere classrooms, providing students with a broad field for learning activities. Revolutionary teachers and students, through labor and criticism of the bourgeoisie with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, making students love the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants from a young age, understand how to work and farm, and gradually become "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers."

2. It creates extremely favorable conditions for the ideological transformation of teachers. Some teachers do not want to go to the countryside, and in fact, they are attached to urban life. Now workers and poor and lower-middle peasants have entered the school and are directly re-educating the teachers. Teachers not only need to go to the factory in batches but also need to spend more time in the countryside, under the education of poor and lower-middle peasants, gradually overcome old ideas, and thoroughly transform their worldview.

3. It enriches the teaching content. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants have taken to the podium, teaching Mao Zedong Thought, teaching classes on class struggle in factories and villages, and teaching industrial and agricultural production practice, providing students with comprehensive education.

In short, the joint running of schools by workers and farmers is good in every way, and it can fully implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th" instructions, cultivating revolutionary successors who are both workers and farmers, both literate and militant.

### 城镇学校还是工农联合办好

专栏：

    编者按：“城市的小学及中学应当如何办？”的讨论开展以来，很多革命群众来信谈到了城镇学校如何办的问题，希望读者也就这个问题发表意见。有些城镇学校已经按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，实行改革并取得初步经验的，希望结合自己的经验来谈。
    城镇学校还是工农联合办好
    吉林省延吉市拖拉机配件厂的工人，遵照毛主席的工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大教导，于今年十月初，派出工人宣传队进驻延安小学，把学校的教育大权全部掌管起来。在厂革委会的领导下，成立了以工人为主体的延安“五·七”战校革委会，领导学校的全部斗、批、改。
    两个月的实践，充分显示出工人阶级领导学校的优越性。
    但是，在全面落实毛主席“五·七”指示的过程中，遇到了一个实际问题。拖拉机配件厂是个仅有三百多人的工厂，而延安小学是拥有一千七百多名学生的学校。这样的小厂要管理这么多学生，并经常组织学生参加工厂里的劳动，是有困难的。怎么办呢？
    大家在讨论中，有人主张由工厂开设附属车间和作坊，但有很多具体问题不好解决，而且不能全面落实毛主席对学生“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的伟大教导。也有人主张扩大学校原有的校田地。但这个办法也不好，教师深有感触地说：“过去学校也有校田地，因为接触不到贫下中农，得不到再教育，受不到锻炼，是为种田而种田。”
    究竟怎么办好？大家从毛主席著作里找答案。毛主席说：“我们的国家是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。”毛主席这一教导，象一盏明灯照亮了工人们的心。他们说，象延吉市这样的城镇，工厂、生产队和学校紧相连，职工、农户居住在一个镇上，培养出来的学生将来不能都当工人，主要还是上山下乡，到农村广阔的天地里去，为什么不把贫下中农请来，一同参加管理学校呢？认识统一了，工人们到附近的生产大队去，征求贫下中农共同办学的意见。贫下中农很高兴，他们说：“过去刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，害得学生五谷不分，光想升官发财。让我们和工人阶级一起管学校，这是我们应该办的事。”
    工人阶级和贫下中农心连心。经过协商和讨论，决定延安“五·七”战校由拖拉机配件厂和长白公社延河大队联合办，成立了以工人为主体，有贫下中农和革命师生代表参加的三结合的教育革命委员会。由工人代表任主任，贫下中农代表任副主任，使学校的教育大权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里。
    工农联合办学校的好处是：
    一、工厂、农村到处是课堂，为学生提供了广阔的学习活动天地。革命师生在同工人、贫下中农共同劳动、共同批判资产阶级的过程中，向工人、贫下中农学习，使学生从小就热爱工人阶级、热爱贫下中农，懂得做工，懂得务农，可以逐步成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    二、为教师的思想改造创造了极为有利的条件。有的教师不愿意到农村，实际上是贪恋城市生活。现在工人、贫下中农开进学校了，直接对教师进行再教育，教师不仅要分期分批进工厂，而且要以更多的时间到农村，在贫下中农的教育下，逐步克服旧思想，彻底改造世界观。
    三、丰富了教学内容。工人、贫下中农登上了讲台，讲毛泽东思想课，讲工厂、农村里的阶级斗争课，讲工农业生产实践课，使学生获得全面的教育。
    总之，工农联合办校千好万好，就是能全面地落实毛主席的“五·七”指示，可以培养亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命事业接班人。
