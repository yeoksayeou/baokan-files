Jiao Xie Commune in Jiangsu Province's Hai'an County has organized a "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Two-Line Struggle Education Lecture Team" to extensively discuss the history of the two-line struggle in rural areas during the socialist revolution period. This has powerfully promoted the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle and has facilitated the deepening of the struggle-criticism-transformation campaign.

When organizing the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Two-Line Struggle Education Lecture Team," some people said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants have no education; they can't speak coherently." The commune revolutionary committee and militia team believed that whether to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants in the education of the two-line struggle is a fundamental issue of stance. Therefore, to make the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Two-Line Struggle Education Lecture Team" successful, it is necessary to unify the thinking of all cadres in the commune. Thus, they organized a study of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you attack them, you attack the revolution," and discussed the role of the poor and lower-middle peasants in various revolutionary movements. Through study, everyone realized that the poor and lower-middle peasants have always firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the two-line struggle. They have the most practical experience and the most right to speak about the history of the two-line struggle. Only by mobilizing and relying on them to speak can the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle be successfully carried out.

After unifying their thinking, the commune and brigade cadres immediately went deep into the production brigades to select old party members, old poor peasants, and old militiamen who have deep hatred and bitterness, firmly walk the socialist road, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They held training classes to organize them to study Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "historical experience is worth noting," and the editorials of the central newspapers and journals. They also helped them prepare the content for their lectures. Subsequently, they organized more than 2,000 poor and lower-middle peasant cadres from the entire commune into more than 140 poor and lower-middle peasant two-line struggle education lecture teams. They went deep into the fields, courtyards, homes, and residences to extensively praise the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao, to highly praise the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and to extensively discuss the history of the two-line struggle in rural areas during the socialist revolution period. They fiercely exposed and criticized the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in "cutting down cooperatives" and advocating "three selfs and one package," among other things.

The poor and lower-middle peasant lecture teams spread the history of the two-line struggle quickly and vividly. They linked it to their local experiences and personal experiences in the two-line struggle. They lectured in large meetings, small meetings, during the day, and at night. They lectured in groups and individually, speaking very seriously, ensuring that everyone in the family and every child knew. Once, an old poor peasant woman in the first production brigade of Jiao Xie did not participate in the study of the history of the two-line struggle. After the lecture team members discovered this, they immediately went to her home and patiently explained the history of the two-line struggle within the party to her. When they talked about Liu Shaoqi's "three selfs and one package" wind, which wanted to make the poor and lower-middle peasants go back to the old ways, it aroused the old poor peasant woman's intense hatred for Liu Shaoqi. She angrily said, "Liu Shaoqi is the enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must criticize Liu Shaoqi more viciously than dog shit." Wherever the poor and lower-middle peasant lecture teams went, they mobilized the local poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the lectures, leading one to bring two, and two to bring four. Lecture teams formed lecture squads below them, and more than 90% of the adults in the entire commune participated in the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle.

After the activities of the poor and lower-middle peasant lecture teams were launched, they greatly promoted the movement to study the history of the two-line struggle, continuously raising the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen. It aroused their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their intense hatred for the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great swindler Liu Shaoqi. A 70-year-old old poor peasant woman, Miao Changyun, said, "We have a mouth to extensively praise the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to criticize the crimes of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism; we have two hands to work for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to remove Liu Shaoqi, this stumbling block on the revolutionary road; we have two legs to follow Chairman Mao and walk the bright path of socialism."

Under the promotion of the poor and lower-middle peasant lecture teams, the commune immediately launched a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and the struggle-criticism-transformation campaign. Some "old and difficult" problems were quickly solved. The leadership group of Hongwu Brigade had studied several times to improve their work style, but because they did not recognize this problem from the height of the two-line struggle, they could not change it. The poor and lower-middle peasant lecture teams criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of entering the party to become an official" with them, making them realize that whether to change their work style and go deep into the masses is a major issue of whether to follow Chairman Mao and execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Afterwards, they often went deep into the masses and worked with the masses, receiving the warm welcome of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasant lecture teams entered the primary schools, extensively discussed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and promoted the rapid development of the educational revolution.

    依靠贫下中农大讲两条路线斗争史
    贫下中农在两条路线斗争中始终站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，他们最有实践体会，最有发言权
    本报讯　江苏省海安县角斜公社组织“贫下中农两条路线斗争教育讲用团”，大讲社会主义革命时期农村两条路线斗争的历史，有力地推动了两条路线斗争史的学习运动，促进了斗批改的深入开展。
    公社革委会和民兵团在组织“贫下中农两条路线斗争教育讲用团”时，有的人说：“贫下中农没文化，讲不出个头绪来。”公社革委会和民兵团同志认为，在两条路线斗争的教育中，是否依靠贫下中农，是个根本立场问题。因此，要把“贫下中农两条路线斗争教育讲用团”搞好，必须在全社广大干部中统一思想。于是，他们就针对各种活思想，组织大家学习毛主席关于“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命”的教导，畅谈贫下中农在历次革命运动中所起的作用。通过学习，大家认识到，贫下中农在两条路线斗争中始终坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，对于两条路线斗争的历史，他们最有实践体会，最有发言权，只有发动和依靠他们来讲，才能把两条路线斗争史的学习运动搞好。
    在统一认识之后，这个公社的社、队干部，马上深入到生产队，挑选苦大仇深、坚持走社会主义道路、坚定地捍卫毛主席革命路线的老党员、老贫农、老民兵，举办学习班，组织他们学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告、毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意”的最新指示以及中央两报一刊的社论，并帮助他们准备讲用内容。随后，把全公社两千多个贫下中农骨干，组成了一百四十多个贫下中农两条路线斗争教育讲用团，深入到田头、场头、家庭、住宅，大颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，大赞毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲社会主义革命时期农村两条路线斗争的历史，猛揭狠批刘少奇及其代理人“大砍合作社”和鼓吹“三自一包”等一系列罪行。
    贫下中农讲用团对两条路线斗争史传得快，讲得活。他们联系本地、本人在两条路线斗争中的经历讲。他们大会讲、小会讲，白天讲、晚上讲，小组讲，个别讲，讲得非常认真，做到家喻户晓，妇孺皆知。一次，角斜大队第一生产队一个贫农老大娘没有参加队里两条路线斗争历史的学习，讲用团的同志发现以后，立即跑到她家里去，耐心地把党内两条路线斗争的历史讲给她听。当讲到刘少奇大刮“三自一包”妖风，要我们贫下中农往回头路上走的时候，激发了贫农老大娘对刘少奇的强烈仇恨，她愤怒地说：“刘少奇这个大坏蛋就是我们贫下中农的死对头，我们一定要把刘少奇批得比狗屎还臭。”贫下中农讲用团讲到那里，就带动了那里的贫下中农一起参加讲用，一带两，两带四。讲用团以下成立讲用队，全社百分之九十以上的成年人都投入了两条路线斗争史的学习运动。
    贫下中农讲用团的活动开展以后，大大推动了两条路线斗争史的学习运动，不断地提高了广大贫下中农和民兵的两条路线斗争觉悟，激发了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的无比仇恨。七十多岁的老贫农缪长云老大娘说：“我们长了一张嘴，就是要大讲毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利，就是要批判刘少奇反革命修正主义的罪行；长了一双手，就是要为毛主席的革命路线工作，就是要搬掉刘少奇这个革命路上的拌脚石；长了两条腿，就是要跟毛主席走，走社会主义的光明大道。”
    在贫下中农讲用团的推动下，公社立即掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想和斗、批、改的新高潮。一些“老大难”的问题很快得到解决。红武大队领导小组，几次研究要改进领导作风，但是，由于没有从两条路线斗争的高度来认识这个问题，一直改不了。贫下中农讲用团和他们一起批判了刘少奇的“入党做官论”，使他们认识到能不能改变作风，深入群众，是关系到是否紧跟毛主席，执行毛主席的革命路线的大问题。以后他们就经常深入群众，和群众一起劳动，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。贫下中农讲用团进入小学，大讲毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，推动了教育革命迅猛发展。
