Chinese technicians assisting in the construction of the Sana'a-Sada road in Yemen recently completed an underground water source survey in the suburbs of Taiz, a city in southern Yemen. They were warmly welcomed by the local people.

Taiz has long suffered from water shortages, especially during the dry season, when the city faces severe water scarcity. Therefore, timely surveys of underground water sources and the drilling of wells have become an urgent need for the broad masses of people in Taiz.

During the survey, the Chinese underground water source survey team, undaunted by hardships and fatigue, worked together with Yemeni colleagues to climb mountains and traverse valleys, conducting dozens of days of field hydrogeological surveys in various underground water source areas in the suburbs of Taiz. Finally, they set up the first exploratory well in a new underground water source area about five kilometers north of Taiz. Based on the data provided by the exploratory well, after the drilling work was completed, the water output of this new underground water source area can basically meet the living water needs of the residents of Taiz.

Yemeni friends expressed enthusiastic praise and heartfelt thanks for the efforts of the Chinese underground water source survey team and hailed the firm friendship between the peoples of the two countries. A responsible official from a relevant Yemeni department said: "In the past, Americans established a temporary and limited water project in Taiz, with the intention of making Yemeni people beg them again in the future. However, their plot did not succeed. The Yemeni people are determined to take the road of self-reliance."

    我技术人员帮助也门勘察到一处地下水源
    受到也门朋友的热烈欢迎
    新华社萨那二十六日电　帮助也门修建萨那—萨达公路工程的中国地下水源勘察人员，最近在也门南方的塔伊兹市郊区，完成了一项地下水源勘察工作，受到当地人民热烈欢迎。
    塔伊兹市一向缺水，特别是干旱季节，这个城市更加严重缺水。因此，及时勘察地下水源，开凿水井，成为塔伊兹市广大人民群众的迫切愿望。
    中国地下水源勘察人员在勘察过程中，不怕苦，不怕累，和也门工作人员一起爬山越岭对塔伊兹市郊区各个地下水源地区进行了数十天的野外水文地质勘察，终于在塔伊兹市以北五公里的一个新地下水源地区布置了第一眼勘探孔。根据勘探孔提供的资料，钻孔施工结束后，这个新地下水源地区的出水量可以基本上满足塔伊兹市居民的生活用水的需要。
    也门朋友对中国地下水源勘察人员的努力表示热情赞扬和衷心感谢，并欢呼也中两国人民之间的牢固友谊。一位也门有关部门的负责人说：“过去美国人在塔伊兹市曾建立了一个暂时的、有限的水利工程，其目的就是让也门人民以后再乞求他们。但是，他们的企图没有实现。也门人民决心走自力更生的道路。”
