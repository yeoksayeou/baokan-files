The heroic people of Thailand, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, are hoisting high the banner of revolutionary armed struggle and advancing from victory to victory. This year, the Thai people's armed struggle has achieved great development. According to incomplete statistics, in eleven months, the Thai people's armed forces have launched 580-plus offensive operations, annihilating a large number of enemy forces. Through these battles, the Thai people's armed forces have not only consolidated their base areas but also opened up many new operational regions. The Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle is presenting a thriving and prosperous situation.

The rapid development and growth of the Thai people's armed struggle have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thanom clique, fundamentally shaking their reactionary rule. The U.S.-Thai reactionaries, in an attempt to salvage their failure, have intensified their counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" against the people's armed forces. In the northeast alone, from March to July this year, the U.S.-Thanom clique deployed fifteen battalions to carry out large-scale counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" against the people's armed forces. The U.S. aggressor troops are increasingly participating openly in the suppression of the people's armed forces. In many places in the southern provinces, there are U.S. "special warfare units" stationed, directly aiding the Thanom clique in attacking the people's armed forces. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Unger, frequently travels to the northeast and south of Thailand, plotting to extinguish the Thai people's revolution.

However, the brave Thai people's armed forces, carrying forward the spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, have engaged in tenacious battles with the enemy. They fully unleash the power of people's war, often "dividing forces to mobilize the masses and concentrating forces to deal with the enemy," turning the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" of our forces into our forces' numerous small-scale encirclements of the enemy. Therefore, the people's armed forces, which are temporarily at a disadvantage overall, can concentrate superior forces in specific battles to annihilate the enemy in groups. They employ flexible and mobile strategies and tactics, frequently creating brilliant feats of defeating the enemy with fewer forces. For example, in the famous battle of Lanhsinan against "encirclement and suppression," a small squad of the people's armed forces, consisting of only thirteen soldiers, was surrounded by the enemy on all sides. They bravely and cleverly broke through the enemy's encirclement and excellently annihilated eighty-seven enemy soldiers.

In the battles against "encirclement and suppression," the Thai people's armed forces also dispatched elite units deep into enemy-occupied areas to launch surprise attacks on important military facilities. The attack on the U.S. airbase in Udon on July 26 is a prominent example. This battle fully exposed the paper tiger nature of the U.S.-Thanom clique.

The Thai people's armed forces have implemented the correct line of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses. This year, they have sent out more than eighty armed propaganda teams to work among the peasant masses. The people's armed forces have also executed more than one hundred reactionary elements who were extremely detested by the people. The unity between the military and the people is unbreakable. The active support of the broad peasant masses is the fundamental guarantee for the Thai people's armed forces to defeat the enemy.

The Thai people's armed forces are rapidly growing and strengthening. They have developed from a small guerrilla force of three years ago into a powerful people's army. The areas of armed struggle are also continuously expanding. On September 30, the ethnic minorities in Nakhon Pathom County, Phetchabun Province, central Thailand, united and began armed struggle. They severely punished a reactionary village head and fiercely struck down the reactionary police who came to suppress the people, demonstrating their invincible might. Currently, the flames of people's revolutionary armed struggle have spread to thirty-one of Thailand's seventy-one provinces, covering more than one hundred counties.

The Thai people's revolutionary struggle is an important part of the world's revolutionary struggle. It not only deals a heavy blow to the Thai reactionaries but also strikes a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, disrupting U.S. imperialism's strategic deployments in Southeast Asia. The heroic Thai people have used their guns to create a great situation, setting an example of daring to struggle and daring to win for all oppressed nations and peoples around the world.

    充分发挥人民战争威力　发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利精神
    泰国人民革命武装斗争形势大好
    今年以来消灭敌人大批有生力量，开辟许多新的作战地区
    本报讯　英雄的泰国人民，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，高举革命武装斗争的旗帜，从胜利走向胜利。今年以来，泰国人民武装斗争取得了很大发展。据不完全统计，在十一个月中，泰国人民武装出击五百八十多次，消灭了大量有生力量。通过战斗，泰国人民武装不仅巩固了根据地，而且开辟了许多新的作战地区。泰国人民革命武装斗争呈现出一派蓬勃发展的大好形势。
    泰国人民武装斗争的迅速发展壮大，沉重地打击了美国—他侬集团，从根本上动摇了它们的反动统治。美泰反动派为了挽救失败，对人民武装加紧进行疯狂的反革命“围剿”。仅在东北部，从今年三月至七月，美国—他侬集团曾使用十五个营的兵力对人民武装实行大规模的反革命“围剿”。美国侵略军越来越多地公开参加镇压人民武装。在泰国南部各府的许多地方，都驻有美国的“特种战斗部队”，直接帮助他侬集团进攻人民武装部队。美国驻泰国大使昂格尔到泰国东北部、南部等地频繁活动，策划扑灭泰国人民革命的罪恶勾当。
    但是，英勇的泰国人民武装发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，同敌人展开了顽强的战斗。他们充分发挥人民战争的威力，经常“分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人”，“将敌军对我军的一个大‘围剿’，改为我军对敌军的许多各别的小围剿”。因此，在全体上还暂时处于劣势的人民武装力量，能够在具体的战斗中，集中优势兵力，成股地歼灭敌人。他们运用机动灵活的战略战术，经常创造以少胜多的光辉战绩。例如，在著名的廊希南的反“围剿”战斗中，人民武装的一个小分队只有十三个战士，被敌人四面包围，他们英勇机智，冲出敌人包围圈，并且出色地消灭敌人八十七名。
    在反“围剿”战斗中，泰国人民武装还派出精干部队，深入敌占区，出敌不意地对一些重要军事设施进行袭击。七月二十六日，对乌隆美国空军基地的袭击，就是一个突出的例子。这次战斗充分暴露了美国—他侬集团的纸老虎本质。
    泰国人民武装执行了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众的正确路线。今年以来，先后派出八十多次武装宣传队，在农民群众中进行工作。人民武装还处决了民愤极大的一百多名反动分子。军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌。广大农民群众的积极支持，是泰国人民武装部队战胜敌人的最根本的保证。
    泰国人民武装部队正在迅速成长壮大。他们已经由三年前的一支小游击队，发展成为一支坚强的人民军队。武装斗争的地区也不断扩大。九月三十日，泰国中部彭世洛府那空泰县少数民族人民团结起来，开始了武装斗争，他们严惩了一名反动村长，痛击了前往镇压人民的反动警察，显示了不可战胜的威力。目前，人民革命武装斗争的烈火已经扩展到泰国全部七十一个府中的三十一个府，活动范围达到一百多个县。
    泰国人民的革命斗争是全世界人民革命斗争的重要组成部分。它不仅沉重地打击了泰国反动派，而且沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，打击了美帝国主义在东南亚的战略部署。英雄的泰国人民用枪杆子打出了一个大好形势，为全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民提供了一个敢于斗争、敢于胜利的榜样。
