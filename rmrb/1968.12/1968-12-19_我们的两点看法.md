Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Medical and health work is no exception. We must emphasize proletarian politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the cooperative medical system. This is the fundamental foundation, the key to the key. We must also truly implement the "prevention first" policy, strengthen preventive work, and reduce or even eliminate epidemic, seasonal, and endemic diseases.

Our views on the following two issues:

1. How should patients who take medication regularly bear the cost of their medicine?
   We believe that this issue should be viewed from a class perspective. If the patient is a poor peasant and a household in difficulty, suffering from a chronic illness and taking medication regularly, this should be treated as a special case. The collective welfare fund can be used to cover part or all of the cost. Based on the situation in our area, such cases are extremely rare in the production brigade.

2. Should the children of four categories of people participate in the cooperative medical system?
   Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements and their children should be treated differently. Our view is: those who are loyal to Chairman Mao, can distinguish themselves from their families, and have good political and labor performance can participate; those with partial poor performance can participate after a period of observation and approval by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    我们的两点看法
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”医疗卫生工作也不例外。我们必须突出无产阶级政治，以毛泽东思想来统帅合作医疗制度，这是根本的根本，关键的关键。还必须真正执行“预防为主”的方针，加强预防工作，减少以至消灭流行性、季节性多发病和地方病。
    我们对于下面两个问题的看法：
    一、常年吃药的病人怎样负担药费？
    我们认为要从阶级观点来看问题。如果是贫下中农，又是困难户，患慢性病常年吃药，应作为特殊情况来处理，可以从队里公益金中解决部分或全部。根据我们地区的情况，这样的人在大队是极少的。
    二、四类分子的子女是否能参加合作医疗？
    地、富、反、坏分子同其子女要有区别。我们的看法是：忠于毛主席的，同家庭能划清界限，政治、劳动表现好的，可以参加；部分表现不好的经过一段时期考察，经广大贫下中农讨论通过也可参加。江苏省东台县富安人民公社医院
