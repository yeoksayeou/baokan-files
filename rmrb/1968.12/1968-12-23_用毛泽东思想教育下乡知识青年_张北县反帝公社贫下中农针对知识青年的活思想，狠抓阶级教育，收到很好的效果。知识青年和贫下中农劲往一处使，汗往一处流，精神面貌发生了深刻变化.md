The poor and lower-middle peasants of Fan Di Commune in Zhangbei County have conducted ideological education among the down-to-the-countryside youth, focusing on class education, and have achieved good results. The youth and the poor and lower-middle peasants are united in their efforts, working together and sweating together, and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, December 21st—The poor and lower-middle peasants of Fan Di Commune in Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, have used the great Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate the down-to-the-countryside youth, achieving good results. Recently, the Zhangbei County Revolutionary Committee summarized the experience of this commune in educating the youth and promoted it throughout the county.

In June of this year, more than 1,200 youth from Zhangjiakou City settled in various communes in Zhangbei County, with 103 of them in eight brigades and a forestry farm in Fan Di Commune. Additionally, 71 youth whose families are in Fan Di Commune returned to the countryside to participate in production labor. The Fan Di Commune Revolutionary Committee attaches great importance to re-educating this group of youth. A deputy director of the commune Revolutionary Committee is specifically responsible for this work, and each brigade has established a three-in-one leadership group consisting of representatives from the brigade Revolutionary Committee, poor and lower-middle peasants, and down-to-the-countryside youth to focus on re-educating the youth.

The fundamental experience of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Fan Di Commune in re-educating the down-to-the-countryside youth is to arm them with the great Mao Zedong Thought. Addressing the issue of some youth who "talk a big game but don't walk the walk," the leadership group helps them study Mao Zedong Thought and focuses on the practical application of it. Initially, some down-to-the-countryside youth did not take studying Chairman Mao's works seriously, and some thought they had already studied enough and were mainly there to learn production techniques. Addressing these ideological issues, the three-in-one leadership group first helped the youth establish a "daily study" routine, ensuring they studied Chairman Mao's works alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, participated in study sessions, and engaged in self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism. The poor and lower-middle peasants taught the youth by example, quickly fostering a revolutionary study style that combined theory with practice. An elderly poor peasant, Huang Yonglu, despite his age and poor health, was always present at study sessions and criticism meetings, never late, and always actively participating. His dedication to studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and his concern for national affairs deeply influenced the down-to-the-countryside youth. Over the past half-year, 30% of the youth in the commune have been recognized as active learners and applicators of Mao Zedong Thought at the brigade, commune, and county levels. The youth in Shuquan Brigade have been recognized as an advanced collective in the county for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Another important experience of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Fan Di Commune in educating the down-to-the-countryside youth is to intensify class struggle education, helping the youth raise their proletarian consciousness. The revolutionary youth going to the countryside and uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants has made a small group of class enemies very fearful. In Guohuangrang Brigade, class enemies maliciously spread rumors, attempting to sow discord between the poor and lower-middle peasants and the down-to-the-countryside youth, and inciting the youth to leave the countryside. The three-in-one leadership group, in response to this situation, organized the youth and poor and lower-middle peasants to jointly criticize the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's theory of "class struggle extinction," exposing the enemies' plots, and giving the youth a vivid class struggle education.

Each brigade frequently organizes the youth to visit the poor, share bitter meals, and invite elderly poor peasants to tell the history of the village and their families, deepening their understanding of class and class struggle.

Participating in production labor is an excellent classroom for the youth to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Before each major production campaign, the brigade Revolutionary Committees help the down-to-the-countryside youth hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, educating them with Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" to establish the idea of farming for revolution and the confidence to overcome all difficulties. When the youth went to the countryside, it coincided with the busy summer weeding season, which was a severe test for those who had never even held a hoe. Initially, the youth were full of enthusiasm and worked hard, but some became discouraged due to fatigue. Addressing this situation, some brigade Revolutionary Committees promptly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the fields, organizing the youth to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," encouraging them to learn from the old fool and the poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary spirit of enduring hardship and fatigue, ultimately helping the youth successfully overcome the labor challenge.

Over the past half-year, the down-to-the-countryside youth in Fan Di Commune, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the warm help and education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, have established deep class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. The youth's initial fears of hardship, fatigue, and dirt have disappeared. Now, they share the same amount of dirt with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They work together and sweat together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many youth use their spare time to enthusiastically tutor illiterate poor and lower-middle peasants in studying Chairman Mao's works. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, regardless of whether it is day or night, windy or rainy, they go door-to-door to promptly convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving enthusiastic praise from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    用毛泽东思想教育下乡知识青年
    张北县反帝公社贫下中农针对知识青年的活思想，狠抓阶级教育，收到很好的效果。知识青年和贫下中农劲往一处使，汗往一处流，精神面貌发生了深刻变化
    据新华社石家庄二十一日电　河北省张北县反帝公社的贫下中农，针对下乡知识青年的活思想，用伟大的毛泽东思想对知识青年进行再教育，收到良好的效果。前不久，张北县革委会总结了这个公社教育知识青年的经验，并在全县加以推广。
    今年六月，张家口市有一千二百多个知识青年到张北县各公社安家落户，其中有一百零三人在反帝公社的八个大队和公社的一个林场集体插队。还有七十一个家在反帝公社的知识青年回乡参加生产劳动。反帝公社革委会很重视对这批知识青年进行再教育。社革委会一名副主任专门负责这项工作，各大队也都建立了有大队革委会代表、贫下中农代表和下乡知识青年代表参加的三结合领导小组，专门抓对知识青年的再教育。
    反帝公社贫下中农对下乡知识青年进行再教育，最根本的经验就是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装他们，针对他们之中有些人“讲起来一大套，行动上不对号”的毛病，帮助他们学习毛泽东思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫。开初一段时期，有的下乡知识青年不重视学习毛主席著作，有的认为自己主要是学生产技术，毛主席著作已经学得差不多了。针对这些活思想，三结合领导小组首先帮助知识青年建立起雷打不动的“天天读”制度，并且让他们和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起开讲用会，一起斗私批修。贫下中农对知识青年言传身教，很快便在下乡知识青年中带出了一个理论联系实际的革命学风。这个大队有个老贫农黄永禄，年纪大，身体又不好，但他人老心红，学习毛主席著作讲用会，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的批判会，他次次参加，从不迟到，并且每次都积极发言，对毛泽东思想活学活用，对国家大事十分关心。下乡知识青年从他身上受到深刻的教育。半年来，全公社已有百分之三十的知识青年被评为大队、公社和县的活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。水泉大队的下乡知识青年被评为全县活学活用毛泽东思想的先进集体。
    反帝公社贫下中农教育下乡知识青年的另一条重要经验是，狠抓阶级斗争教育，帮助知识青年提高无产阶级觉悟。革命的知识青年下乡和贫下中农相结合，使一小撮阶级敌人十分害怕。郭虎壤大队就发现阶级敌人恶毒地散布流言蜚语，挑拨贫下中农和下乡知识青年的关系，煽动知识青年离开农村。三结合领导小组针对这种情况，组织知识青年和贫下中农一起，狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，揭穿了敌人的阴谋，给知识青年上了一堂生动的阶级斗争教育课。
    各大队还经常组织知识青年访贫问苦、吃忆苦饭，请老贫农给青年们讲村史、家史，加深他们对阶级和阶级斗争的认识。
    参加生产劳动，是知识青年接受贫下中农再教育的极好课堂。反帝公社各大队革委会在每次较大的生产战役前，都要帮助下乡知识青年办一期毛泽东思想学习班，教育他们以毛主席的“老三篇”武装自己，树立起为革命种田的思想和战胜一切困难的信心。知识青年下乡时，正赶上夏锄大忙季节，这对一些连锄把都没有摸过的知识青年是一次严峻的考验。开初几天，青年们个个斗志昂扬，干得很起劲，但因为累，有些人渐渐的情绪低落了。针对这种情况，一些大队革委会及时在田边地头办起了毛泽东思想学习班，组织知识青年反复学习毛主席的光辉著作《愚公移山》，鼓励他们学习老愚公，学习贫下中农终年累月不怕苦、不怕累的革命干劲，终于使青年们胜利地闯过了劳动关。
    半年来，在反帝公社插队的下乡知识青年，在毛泽东思想哺育下，在贫下中农的热情帮助和教育下，和贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。知识青年初下乡时那种怕苦、怕累、怕脏的毛病不见了，现在是贫下中农身上有多少泥，青年们身上有多少泥。他们和贫下中农劲往一处使，汗往一处流。许多知识青年利用工余时间，热情地辅导不识字的贫下中农学习毛主席著作。毛主席最新指示发表时，不管是白天、黑夜，还是刮风、下雨，他们都要挨门逐户地及时把毛主席的最新指示传达给贫下中农，受到了广大贫下中农的热烈赞扬。
