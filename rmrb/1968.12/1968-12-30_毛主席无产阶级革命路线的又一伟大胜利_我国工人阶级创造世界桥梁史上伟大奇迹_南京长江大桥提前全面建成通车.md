On December 29, the highway bridge was successfully completed, and 500,000 military personnel and civilians in Nanjing held a grand rally to celebrate, enthusiastically shouting long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live! The completion of the magnificent and majestic Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge has significant political, economic, and strategic importance as it connects the country's north-south railways and highways.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 29: On the day when the Chinese people are enthusiastically celebrating the successful testing of a new hydrogen bomb, another piece of exciting news came from the banks of the Yangtze River: relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese working class has, with high speed and high quality, completed the highway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge on December 29, 1968. Thus, the largest self-designed and self-built modern bridge in China—the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge—has been fully completed and opened to traffic ahead of schedule.

On the morning of December 29, more than 50,000 military personnel and civilians gathered on the riverbank and the bridgehead, braving the rain to hold a grand meeting to celebrate the bridge's completion ahead of schedule. They enthusiastically celebrated the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the fruitful results of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! After the celebration, red signal flares soared into the sky, and amidst the sound of firecrackers and drums, more than 100 decorated vehicles carrying representatives of Nanjing workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards slowly crossed the highway bridge. Immediately, the south and north banks of the river, the bridge above and below, inside and outside the vehicles, were filled with joy. The shouts of "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" shook the earth and echoed through the clouds.

The completion of the magnificent and majestic Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a great miracle in the history of world bridge construction. The railway bridge is over 6,700 meters long, and the highway bridge is over 4,500 meters long. The lower layer of the main bridge has double tracks, allowing trains from the south and north to pass simultaneously; the upper layer has a wide road surface that can accommodate four large trucks side by side. At both ends of the main bridge stand four giant statues of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The approach bridges on both sides, near the urban area, consist of 22 arches with national characteristics, resembling a beautiful rainbow, making the magnificent Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge even more colorful. In the morning, the rising sun shines on the giant bridge structure, like a steel rainbow lying in the clouds; the three red flags on the bridgehead pierce the sky, especially bright and eye-catching. At night, the bridge is illuminated by ten thousand lights, stretching for tens of miles, like the Milky Way falling on the vast river, adorning the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland.

The full completion and opening of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge have connected the north-south transportation arteries of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and connected the north-south highway transportation, which has significant political, economic, and strategic importance.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The experience of history is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." The revolutionary workers building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, combined with their own battle practices, reviewed the process of bridge construction, further raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and accelerating the progress of bridge construction. The broad masses of workers say that the history of building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the history of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, and it is the history of the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents pushed a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines in the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. They opposed the great policy of "self-reliance and hard work" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, advocating slave philosophy and crawling, absurdly proposing: "Without a few 'foreign experts,' it is impossible to build the Yangtze River Bridge in Nanjing." The workers and revolutionary engineering and technical personnel armed with Mao Zedong Thought fought a head-on battle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by Liu Shaoqi and his agents. They followed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "breaking the foreign framework and walking our own industrial development path," firmly implementing the policy of "self-reliance," and advancing bravely along the course indicated by Chairman Mao. They actively applied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Practice," explored experience from practice, dared to walk the path that no one had walked before, dared to climb the peaks that no one had climbed before, and blazed a broad path for China's self-reliant bridge building. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the bridge builders, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly smashed Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, firmly grasped the power of bridge building in the hands of the proletariat, and ensured the smooth progress of bridge construction.

The practice of building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge has proved that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly rely on the working class, and thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, we can overcome any difficulties on the road ahead and create miracles on earth.

The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "the working class must lead everything" and "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation" have greatly inspired the workers building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. In leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the broad masses of bridge builders, with deep hatred for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents, ignited the blazing fire of revolutionary criticism and launched a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. In the more than two months after National Day, thousands of various types of on-site criticism meetings were held throughout the bridge construction site. The workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, broke away from the revisionist management system, fully displayed their boundless wisdom and creativity, and greatly accelerated the construction of the bridge. After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the bridge builders enthusiastically responded to the battle call put forward in the communiqué, grasped the revolution, promoted production, braved the wind and rain, and persisted in construction. Work efficiency increased several times, and the bridge construction task was completed ahead of schedule with astonishing speed.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the bridge support, support work, and protect the bridge units fought side by side with the broad masses of workers in the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, fully playing the role of the fighting team, work team, and production team, and establishing new merits in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge.

The railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was officially opened to traffic on October 1 of this year, and the highway bridge held an opening ceremony on December 29. Thus, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was fully completed and opened to traffic throughout the line.

    毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利
    我国工人阶级创造世界桥梁史上伟大奇迹
    南京长江大桥提前全面建成通车
    十二月二十九日，胜利建成公路桥，南京五万军民隆重集会庆祝，热烈欢呼毛主席万岁！万万岁！雄伟壮丽的长江大桥的建成，沟通了我国南北铁路和公路交通，在政治、经济、战略上有着重大意义
    新华社南京二十九日电　在亿万军民热烈欢呼我国成功地进行了一次新的氢弹试验的大喜日子里，从扬子江畔又传来一个振奋人心的喜讯：我国工人阶级靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，高速度、高质量地在一九六八年十二月二十九日，胜利地建成了南京长江大桥的公路桥。至此，我国自行设计和建造的最大的现代化桥梁——南京长江大桥，已经全面提前建成通车。
    十二月二十九日上午，南京市五万多军民欢聚在江边桥头，冒雨隆重举行大会，庆祝大桥的提前全面建成，热烈欢呼伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利，热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果！庆祝大会结束后，红色的信号弹腾空而起，在一片鞭炮和锣鼓声中，一百多辆满载南京工农兵代表和红卫兵小将的彩车徐徐通过公路桥。顿时，大江南北，桥上桥下，车内车外，一片欢腾。“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声震撼大地，响彻云霄。
    雄伟壮丽的南京长江大桥的建成，是世界桥梁史上的一个伟大奇迹。大桥铁路桥全长六千七百多米，公路桥全长四千五百多米。江中正桥下层铺设双轨，南来北往的列车可以同时对开；上层宽阔的公路桥面，可以并列行驶四辆大型卡车。正桥两端，矗立着四座巨大的工农兵的塑像。两岸公路引桥接近市区的部分由二十二孔富有民族特色的双曲拱桥组成，看去象一条美丽的彩练，使宏伟的南京长江大桥显得更加绚丽多姿。清晨，喷薄而出的红日映照着大桥巨大的桥身，如同横卧云空的钢铁长虹；桥头堡的三面红旗直插云霄，格外鲜艳夺目。入夜，大桥上万盏灯火齐放光明，绵延十几里，有如银河飘落在宽阔的江面上，把祖国的大好河山装扮得分外妖娆。
    南京长江大桥的全面建成通车，把我国南北交通大动脉津浦线和沪宁线连接了起来，把大江南北的公路交通连接了起来，在政治上、经济上、战略上有着重大的意义。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”建设南京长江大桥的革命工人反复学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，并且结合自己的战斗实践，回顾了大桥的建设过程，进一步提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，更加速了大桥的建设进程。广大工人群众说，南京长江大桥的建桥史，就是两个阶级、两条路线的斗争史，就是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利史。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人，在南京长江大桥建设中推行了一整套反革命修正主义路线，他们对抗伟大领袖毛主席提出的“自力更生，奋发图强”的伟大方针，鼓吹洋奴哲学、爬行主义，荒谬地提出：“没有几个‘外国专家’，要在南京修造长江大桥是不可能的”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的建桥工人和革命的工程技术人员，同刘少奇及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们遵照毛主席“打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路”的伟大教导，坚定不移地贯彻执行“自力更生”的方针，沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进。他们活学活用毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》，从实践中摸索经验，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，闯出了一条我国自力更生建桥的宽广道路。在无产阶级文化大革命中，建桥工人在人民解放军的大力支持下，彻底粉碎了刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，把建桥大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级的手里，保证了大桥建设的胜利进行。
    南京长江大桥建设的实践证明，只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定不移地依靠工人阶级，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，就能克服前进道路上的任何困难，就能创造出人间的奇迹来。
    伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”和“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大教导，极大地鼓舞了南京长江大桥的建桥工人。广大建桥工人在领导斗、批、改中，怀着对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人的刻骨仇恨，燃起革命大批判的熊熊烈火，向着反革命修正主义路线猛烈进攻。在国庆以后两个多月的时间内，整个大桥工地开了数千次各种类型的现场批判会。工人群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，破除修正主义的管理制度，发挥了无穷无尽的智慧和创造力，大大加快了大桥的建设。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，建桥工人热烈响应公报提出的战斗号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，冒着风雨严寒坚持施工，工效成倍提高，以惊人的速度提前全面地完成了大桥建设任务。
    人民解放军驻大桥支左、支工、护桥部队的广大指战员，在南京长江大桥建设过程中，同广大工人群众并肩战斗，充分发挥战斗队、工作队和生产队的作用，在长江大桥建设中立下了新的功勋。
