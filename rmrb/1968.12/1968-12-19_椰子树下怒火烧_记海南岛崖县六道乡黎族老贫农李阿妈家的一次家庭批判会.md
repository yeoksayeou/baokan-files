"Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roadster Liu Shaoqi!" Angry shouts pierced the night's silence as a family criticism meeting began under the coconut trees in the courtyard of Li Amah, an elderly poor peasant from the Li ethnic minority in Liuqiao Township, Yaxian County, Hainan Island.

Li Amah stood up and began her criticism: "The filial son of the landlord class, Liu Shaoqi, dares to say that 'exploitation has its merits.' This is sheer nonsense! We Li ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants will never forget the class suffering we endured in the old society. We say: Exploitation is a deadly knife, the poor Li people have no way to escape, exploitation is a crime, and it deserves to die a thousand deaths!" Li Amah then recounted the bitter history of her family's exploitation in the old society, vehemently denouncing Liu Shaoqi's fallacious theory of "exploitation has its merits." Before liberation, Li Amah's family was so poor that they had no house to live in and no land to till, forcing them to rent land from the landlords to farm. In years of severe drought, when the crops failed, the landlords still demanded rent, driving Li Amah's husband to his death. Li Amah cried her heart out, with no way out, she had to send her eldest son to the landlord's house to herd cattle and sell her second son to pay the rent. The emaciated Li Amah, with her third son, fled to beg for food, enduring immense hardships. Fortunately, Chairman Mao, the great savior, rescued her family from the depths of misery. Li Amah's tearful accusations powerfully refuted the reactionary revisionist fallacy of "exploitation has its merits" propagated by the capitalist-roadster Liu Shaoqi.

Amidst the slogans "Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" and "Exploitation is a crime, it deserves to die a thousand deaths!", Li Amah's daughter-in-law, Li Dajie, stood up angrily. She recalled the hardships of the old society, where the Li people wore coconut tree bark and ate wild fruits, picking up seashells to survive. She said, "Liu Shaoqi advocates 'exploitation has its merits,' which means he wants the landlords and fishery tyrants to ride roughshod over us Li ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants again, making us retrace our steps and live the miserable life of the old society, where 'going down the mountain is worse than cattle, going to the sea is worse than fish and shrimp.' Liu Shaoqi's black heart is more poisonous than a scorpion!"

Li Amah's son, Li Yajiang, grew more enraged as he listened to the criticism of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roadster Liu Shaoqi. His heart burned with fury, and he couldn't hold back any longer. Before Li Dajie finished speaking, he stood up and interrupted, "The spy Liu Shaoqi also dares to say that workers and peasants 'welcome exploitation.' This is the greatest slander against the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants! Our Li ethnic people resolutely resist exploitation and have a strong revolutionary spirit. Over thirty years ago, our impoverished Li people followed the path opened by Chairman Mao's Autumn Harvest Uprising, taking up big knives and spears, charging up the Wuzhishan Mountain, establishing revolutionary bases, and fiercely attacking the dark system of human exploitation. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Li revolutionary people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, overthrew Liu Shaoqi and his agents in our Li ethnic region, thoroughly smashing their evil plot to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism! We Li people are determined to follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" As Li Yajiang finished speaking, Li Amah's four-year-old grandson, Hongbing, raised his little fist and shouted, "Down with Liu Shaoqi! Defend Chairman Mao!"

"Millions of workers and peasants surge forward," "Ten thousand miles of long ropes to bind the rocs," the criticism meeting at Li Amah's home grew more intense. The night was deep, but under the coconut trees, waves of angry shouts continued to erupt.

    椰子树下怒火烧
    ——记海南岛崖县六道乡黎族老贫农李阿妈家的一次家庭批判会
    “打倒大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇！”愤怒的吼声划破了夜空的寂静，海南岛崖县六道乡黎族老贫农李阿妈家的一次家庭批判会，在小院子里的椰子树底下开始了！
    李阿妈站起来，开了炮：“地主阶级的孝子贤孙刘少奇，胡说什么‘剥削有功’，这完全是胡说八道！我们黎族贫下中农永远也忘记不了旧社会受剥削的阶级苦。我们说：剥削是把要命刀，穷苦黎民无路逃，剥削有罪，罪该万死！”接着，李阿妈摆出了旧社会受剥削的血泪家史，痛斥刘少奇“剥削有功”的谬论。解放前，李阿妈家穷得房无一间，地无一垄，不得不租地主的田种。大荒灾年，庄稼颗粒无收，狗地主照样逼租，李阿爹被活活逼死，李阿妈哭断了肠，走投无路，被迫把大儿子送去给地主家放牛，忍痛把二儿子卖掉交租子。骨瘦如柴的李阿妈带着三儿子逃荒要饭，受尽了折磨。多亏大救星毛主席把她一家从水深火热之中拯救出来。李阿妈的血泪控诉，有力地批驳了大工贼刘少奇“剥削有功”的反革命修正主义谬论。
    在“打倒大叛徒刘少奇！”“剥削有罪，罪该万死！”的口号声中，李阿妈的儿媳李大嫂愤怒地站起来，她回顾了黎家旧社会穿椰树皮、吃野果、拣海螺的苦难生活，气愤地说：“刘少奇鼓吹‘剥削有功’，就是要地主、渔霸重新骑在我们黎家贫下中农身上，使我们走回头路，过旧社会那种‘下山不如牛马，下海不及鱼虾’的苦难生活，刘少奇的黑心真比蝎子还毒！……”李阿妈的儿子李亚强越听对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇越仇恨，满腔的怒火再也抑制不住了，李大嫂的话还没有说完，他就站起来抢着说：“大内奸刘少奇还胡说什么工人农民‘欢迎剥削’，这是对工人阶级和贫下中农的最大污蔑！我们黎族人民坚决反抗剥削，有着强烈的革命造反精神。早在三十多年前，我们黎族穷苦人民，就沿着毛主席开辟的秋收起义的道路前进，拿起大刀、长矛，杀上五指山，建立了革命的根据地，向人剥削人的黑暗制度猛烈开火！在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们黎族革命人民在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，造了刘少奇及其在我们黎族地区代理人的反，彻底粉碎了他们妄图颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋！我们黎族人民决心紧跟伟大舵手毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”李亚强的话音刚落，李阿妈四岁的小孙子红兵举起小拳头高呼：“打倒刘少奇！”“保卫毛主席！”
    “百万工农齐踊跃”，“万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚”，李阿妈家的批判会越开越热烈。夜已经很深了，椰子树下还不断爆发出一阵又一阵的怒吼声。
