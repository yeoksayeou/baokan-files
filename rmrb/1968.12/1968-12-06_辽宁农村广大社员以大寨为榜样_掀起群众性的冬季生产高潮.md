The broad masses of rural residents in Liaoning Province are resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing revolution and promoting production." Using the great proletarian cultural revolution as a driving force, taking Daqing as an example, and with the revolutionary spirit of fighting against nature and transforming nature, they have launched a mass winter agricultural and water conservancy construction campaign. This campaign aims to create conditions for a new leap in agricultural production next year.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Liaoning Province, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have reached an unprecedented height in their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. After the autumn harvest, they, under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels and the support of the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support personnel, have launched activities to learn from the people of Daqing, to have the aspirations of Daqing, to follow the path of Daqing, and to build Daqing-style fields.

In more than a month, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants across the province have actively learned and applied Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, and have completed over 100 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, leveled hundreds of thousands of mu of land, built over 700,000 mu of terrace fields, and are urgently constructing more than a thousand small reservoirs. All projects are on a larger scale, faster pace, and better quality compared to previous years, emphasizing practical results.

    辽宁农村广大社员以大寨为榜样
    掀起群众性的冬季生产高潮
    据新华社沈阳四日电　辽宁省农村广大人民公社社员坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以革命大批判为动力，以大寨为榜样，用战天斗地、改造大自然的革命精神，掀起了群众性的冬季农田水利建设热潮，为明年农业生产实现新的跃进创造条件。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的辽宁省广大贫下中农，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高。秋收大忙季节一过，他们就在各级革命委员会和解放军支农人员的带领下，展开了学大寨人，立大寨志，走大寨路，修大寨田的农田水利建设活动。
    一个多月以来，全省广大贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，已经完成土石方工程一亿多立方米，平整土地上百万亩，修水平梯田七十多万亩，有上千座小型水库正在紧张施工。各项工程都比往年规模大，进度快，质量好，讲究实效。
