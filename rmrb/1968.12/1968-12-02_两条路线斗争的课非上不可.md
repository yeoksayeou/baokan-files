Mao Zedong recently instructed us: “Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be frequently discussed and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses.”

Looking back at the history of the Chinese democratic revolution, looking back at the nineteen years since the founding of New China, and looking back at the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every page is filled with the thrilling struggle between the two lines. The history of the Chinese revolution, the history of the Communist Party of China, is the history of the struggle between Mao Zedong’s proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by the likes of Liu Shaoqi. It is the history of the continuous victory of Mao Zedong’s proletarian revolutionary line.

The struggle between the two lines within the Party is a major issue concerning the life and death of the Party and the state power. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the struggle between the two lines within the Party concentrates the class struggle in society. To neglect the struggle between the two lines is to abandon state power and abandon the right to life. We must seriously implement Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. The course on the struggle between the two lines must be taught every day and at all times. The history of the struggle between the two lines must be frequently discussed and repeatedly discussed. If it is not discussed, there will be no class struggle in one’s mind, and there will be no line struggle in one’s heart. One will become negligent and complacent, and there will be the danger of state power being usurped by revisionists as in the Soviet Union. One day, one’s head may fall off without knowing why.

    两条路线斗争的课非上不可
    空军某部副部队长　王思炎
    毛主席最近教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”
    回顾中国民主革命的历史，回顾新中国成立十九年来的历史，回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的历史，每一页都充满了惊心动魄的两条路线的斗争。中国革命的历史，中国共产党的历史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同以刘少奇之流为代表的资产阶级反动路线激烈斗争的历史，就是毛主席无产阶级革命路线不断取得胜利的历史。
    党内两条路线的斗争，是关系到党的存亡，政权的存亡的重大问题。在无产阶级专政条件下，党内两条路线斗争集中反映了社会上的阶级斗争。忽视两条路线斗争，就是放弃政权，放弃生命权。我们必须认真贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，两条路线斗争的课要天天上、时时上，两条路线斗争的历史要经常讲、反复讲。不讲，思想上就没有阶级斗争这个纲，心里就没有路线斗争这根线。就会疏忽麻痹，政权就有象苏联那样被修正主义者篡夺的危险，就会有一天脑袋掉了还不知怎么掉的。
