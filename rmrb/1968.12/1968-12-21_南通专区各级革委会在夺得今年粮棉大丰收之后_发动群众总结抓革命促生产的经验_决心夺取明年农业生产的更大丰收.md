The revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District, Jiangsu Province, have mobilized the masses to summarize their experiences in combining revolution with production after achieving a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year. They are determined to achieve an even greater harvest in agricultural production next year.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Nantong Special District have, in the high tide of implementing and carrying out the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, used the great proletarian cultural revolution as a driving force, and conducted a mass summary of the experiences in responding to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," achieving a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. They are determined to advance victoriously and strive for a greater leap in agricultural production next year.

Nantong Special District is one of the famous high-yield cotton-producing areas in the country. The surging great proletarian cultural revolution has greatly promoted the development of agricultural production. This year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Nantong Special District, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left and supporting agriculture, have grasped revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil crops, and other economic crops. The yield of grain and cotton has exceeded the highest historical level, increasing by more than 10% over the bumper harvest year of 1967. The yield of cotton per mu has exceeded the 100-jin mark for the fifth consecutive year.

Recently, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the district have joyfully summarized the experiences of combining revolution with production to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture. Their feelings are:

**Grasp Class Struggle and the Struggle Between the Two Lines**

The great development of production in Nantong Special District this year was achieved in the midst of fierce class struggle. At the beginning of the spring plowing, some comrades thought, "The capitalist roaders have been overthrown, and the four types of elements have been subdued, so we can concentrate on production." Others were afraid that focusing on class struggle would affect production. The revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District immediately organized a large number of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on class struggle and his latest instructions, to criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle, to expose the class struggle situation in this region and unit, and to discuss the serious consequences of not grasping class struggle. This made everyone realize that grasping class struggle is not just about increasing the yield of grain and cotton by a few jin, but is a matter of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Throughout the district, fields and workplaces became battlefields for revolutionary criticism and struggle against enemies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. Revolutionary criticism promoted the struggle against enemies, and the struggle against enemies provided living teaching materials for criticism. Liu Shaoqi's series of counter-revolutionary crimes were criticized to the point of being unbearable, and hidden class enemies were flushed out from dark corners. Many "hard-to-handle" units also pulled out the nails that hindered production development, and righteousness prevailed, making revolution and production hot and lively.

**Establish the Thought of Farming for the Revolution**

Chairman Mao teaches: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." Criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of the fusion of public and private interests and establishing the thought of being "completely" and "thoroughly" for the revolution is an important link in promoting the great development of agriculture.

Is farming for the revolution or for personal gain? This is the struggle between public and private interests in agricultural production.

The revolutionary committee of Nantong Special District seized on this issue, criticized Liu Shaoqi's theory of the fusion of public and private interests, exposed the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the former regional and county committees who resisted the policy of "grain as the key link" and peddled the black goods of revisionist material incentives. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, started from class education, grasped class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and on the basis of raising the ideological awareness of the broad masses, seriously carried out the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism, solved the problem of public and private relations in agricultural production, and made breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit the ideological foundation for the development of agriculture. This has brought about a great change in people's spiritual outlook. In the past, some members did not work hard when they went out to work, but now they work hard and contribute their wisdom. In the past, some members of the communes along the river and the coast often abandoned collective production during the busy season to go fishing and catch shrimp. This year, they fought against selfishness in the revolutionary criticism, put down their fishing gear, picked up their hoes, and participated in collective production labor.

**Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit of Striving for the Highest Level**

Criticizing Liu Shaoqi's philosophy of "crawling" and continuously educating the broad masses with the spirit of striving for the highest level and daring to scale new heights in production is another reason for Nantong Special District's double harvest of grain and cotton this year.

This year, when discussing production targets, some people said, "Our annual production is not low, our income is not small, and our contribution is not small. It's good enough to maintain the status quo." In response to this conservative thinking, the revolutionary committees at various places strengthened the ideological education of the broad masses to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, making the broad cadres and masses establish the idea of "standing at the mouth of the Yangtze River, looking at Tiananmen, standing on the coast of Huanghai, thinking of the whole world." They linked the specific actions of doing a good job in agricultural production with the great ideal of making contributions to the socialist revolution and construction of the motherland and to the world revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the San Yu area of Nantong learned from Chairman Mao's discussions on thorough revolution and continuous revolution, criticized Liu Shaoqi's philosophy of "crawling," and implemented the production plan with high standards and strict requirements. In the struggle practice, they overcame one difficulty after another, increasing the yield of cotton per mu by more than 20% this year.

In the battle to achieve a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, a prominent problem in Nantong Special District was the shortage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In the face of this difficulty, they broke the theory of "seeing things but not people," insisted on taking the Dazhai road, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and relied on their own strength to implement various measures to deal with drought, waterlogging, and pests. They lacked fertilizer, so they launched an offensive on soil fertilizer; they lacked pesticides, so they mobilized the masses to prevent and treat diseases and pests. Qidong County used 68 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu for cotton last year, but this year it only used 17 jin per mu, yet the cotton yield this year was higher than last year.

**Trust the Masses, Rely on the Masses, and Respect the Masses' Initiative**

Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes," and "the people have limitless creativity." The revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's mass line in developing cotton production. They organized the masses to criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the masses being backward." Now that new creations have appeared among the masses, the revolutionary committees immediately conducted in-depth investigations and research with great enthusiasm, provided strong support, and actively promoted them. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the San Yu area created advanced experiences in treating pests by using lamps to attract moths and besieging the pests' nests. The revolutionary committee immediately promoted this from point to surface. During the period when the moths appeared, the entire Jianghai cotton area was illuminated with tens of thousands of lamps, launching a mass movement to prevent and treat pests. This not only reduced pest damage but also saved pesticides, reducing the cost of agricultural production.

Based on the summary of the mass experiences in achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District have decided to organize a new leap in agricultural production as an important content of implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At present, a new high tide of criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi is sweeping through the entire district, urban and rural areas. In the high tide of criticism, winter production is being carried out vigorously, the scale of agricultural basic construction is unprecedented, and more than 200,000 people throughout the district have participated in water conservancy construction. Winter field management is also being carried out earlier and more solidly than in previous years. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the district have leveled nearly one million mu of land in conjunction with autumn sowing, determined to achieve an even greater bumper harvest in agricultural production next year and welcome the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

    南通专区各级革委会在夺得今年粮棉大丰收之后
    发动群众总结抓革命促生产的经验
    决心夺取明年农业生产的更大丰收
    据新华社南京电　江苏省南通专区广大贫下中农在贯彻、落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的高潮中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以革命大批判为动力，对今年响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，夺得粮棉大丰收的经验，开展了群众性的大总结，决心乘胜前进，争取明年农业生产的更大跃进。
    南通专区是全国著名的高产棉区之一。波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命运动，极大地推动着农业生产的大发展。今年，南通专区广大贫下中农在支左、支农解放军的大力支持下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了粮食、棉花、油料和其他经济作物的全面丰收。粮食和棉花的产量都超过了历史最高水平，比特大丰收的一九六七年增产一成以上，皮棉亩产连续第五年突破了百斤大关。
    最近，在各级革委会的领导下，全专区广大贫下中农满怀胜利的喜悦，总结了以革命带动生产，夺取农业大丰收的经验。他们的体会是：
    狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争
    南通专区今年的生产大发展，是在激烈的阶级斗争中取得的。春耕开始时，有少数同志认为“走资派打倒了，四类分子低头走路了，可以安心搞生产了。”还有的同志怕抓了阶级斗争，影响了生产。南通专区各级革委会针对这种思想立即组织广大革命干部和革命群众大学毛主席关于阶级斗争的伟大学说和一系列的最新指示，大批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大摆本地区、本单位的阶级斗争形势，大议不抓阶级斗争所带来的严重恶果，使大家认识到，狠抓阶级斗争决不是为了多收几斤粮棉，而是关系到巩固无产阶级专政的大事。全区范围内，田间、场头处处摆开了革命大批判和对敌斗争的战场，广大贫下中农主动向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。革命大批判推动了对敌斗争，对敌斗争又为大批判提供了活教材，把刘少奇一系列反革命罪行批得臭不可闻，把隐藏的阶级敌人从阴暗角落里冲刷了出来。许多“老大难”的单位，也拔掉了阻碍生产发展的钉子，正气大发扬，革命、生产搞得热火朝天。
    树立为革命种田的思想
    毛主席教导说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。狠批刘少奇的“公私溶化论”，树立“完全”“彻底”为革命的思想，这是推动农业生产大发展的重要一环。
    种田是为革命，还是为个人？这是农业生产上的公与私的斗争。
    南通专区革委会抓住这个问题，狠批刘少奇的“公私溶化论”，揭露了旧地委、县委内一小撮走资派抵制“以粮为纲”，兜售“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货的罪行。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，从阶级教育入手，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，在提高广大群众思想觉悟的基础上，认真开展斗私批修，解决农业生产中的公私关系问题，把破私立公作为发展农业生产的思想基础，使人的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。过去有些社员出勤不出力，而今出勤出力出智慧。过去沿江、沿海公社的一些社员，往往在大忙中丢掉集体生产，下海捞鱼摸虾，今年他们在革命大批判中，狠斗“私”字，放下渔具，拿起了锄头，参加集体生产劳动。
    发扬鼓足干劲，力争上游的革命精神
    大破刘少奇的“爬行主义”哲学，不断以鼓足干劲，力争上游，敢于攀登生产新高峰的精神教育广大群众。这是南通专区取得粮棉双丰收的又一个原因。
    今年在议论生产指标时，有人说：“我们历年产量不低，收入不少，贡献不少，保持现状就蛮好了。”针对这种固步自封的思想，各地革委会对广大群众加强了发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神的思想教育，使广大干部、群众树立“站在长江口，望到天安门，立足黄海边，想到全世界”的思想，把搞好农业生产的具体行动，同为祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出贡献、为世界革命作出贡献的伟大理想紧密联系起来。南通三余地区的贫下中农学习了毛主席关于彻底革命、不断革命的论述，批判了刘少奇的“爬行主义”哲学，以高标准、严要求落实了生产规划，在斗争实践中闯过了一个个难关，使今年棉花亩产增加两成以上。
    南通专区在夺取今年粮棉丰收的战斗中，一个突出的问题是，化肥、农药不足。在这个困难面前，他们大破了见物不见人的唯条件论，坚持走大寨之路，发扬自力更生，艰苦奋斗的精神，依靠自己的力量，落实了对付旱、涝、病虫的多种措施。缺肥料，向土肥进军，缺农药，就发动群众，防治病害。启东县去年棉花每亩使用化肥六十八斤，今年每亩只用了十七斤，而今年棉花产量却高于去年。
    信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力。”南通专区各级革委会在发展棉花生产时，认真贯彻毛主席的群众路线，他们组织群众狠批了刘少奇的“群众落后论”。现在群众中出现了新的创造，革委会立即满腔热情地调查研究，大力支持，积极推广。三余地区贫下中农在治虫中创造了点灯诱蛾、围剿虫子老巢的先进经验，革委会就及时由点到面地加以推广。在蛾子露头期间，整个江海棉区田边地角万盏灯火，开展了一场防治虫害的群众运动，既减少了虫害，又节约了农药，降低了农业生产的成本。
    南通专区各级革委会在发动群众总结今年农业大丰收的基础上，决定把组织农业生产新飞跃作为落实党的八届十二中全会公报的一项重要内容。目前，一个批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的新高潮席卷全区城乡。在大批判高潮中，冬季生产搞得轰轰烈烈，农田基本建设规模空前，全区已有二十多万人投入水利建设，冬季田间管理也比往年抓得早，抓得扎实。全区广大贫下中农结合秋播已平整了近百万亩土地，决心以更加出色的成绩，夺取明年农业生产更大丰收，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开。
