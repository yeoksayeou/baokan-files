The revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District, Jiangsu Province, have mobilized the masses to summarize their experiences in combining revolution with production after achieving a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year. They are determined to achieve an even greater harvest in agricultural production next year.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Nantong Special District have, in the high tide of implementing and carrying out the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, used the great proletarian cultural revolution as a driving force, and conducted a mass summary of the experiences in responding to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," achieving a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. They are determined to advance victoriously and strive for a greater leap in agricultural production next year.

Nantong Special District is one of the famous high-yield cotton-producing areas in the country. The surging great proletarian cultural revolution has greatly promoted the development of agricultural production. This year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Nantong Special District, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left and supporting agriculture, have grasped revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil crops, and other economic crops. The yield of grain and cotton has exceeded the highest historical level, increasing by more than 10% over the bumper harvest year of 1967. The yield of cotton per mu has exceeded the 100-jin mark for the fifth consecutive year.

Recently, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the district have joyfully summarized the experiences of combining revolution with production to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture. Their feelings are:

**Grasp Class Struggle and the Struggle Between the Two Lines**

The great development of production in Nantong Special District this year was achieved in the midst of fierce class struggle. At the beginning of the spring plowing, some comrades thought, "The capitalist roaders have been overthrown, and the four types of elements have been subdued, so we can concentrate on production." Others were afraid that focusing on class struggle would affect production. The revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District immediately organized a large number of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on class struggle and his latest instructions, to criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle, to expose the class struggle situation in this region and unit, and to discuss the serious consequences of not grasping class struggle. This made everyone realize that grasping class struggle is not just about increasing the yield of grain and cotton by a few jin, but is a matter of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Throughout the district, fields and workplaces became battlefields for revolutionary criticism and struggle against enemies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. Revolutionary criticism promoted the struggle against enemies, and the struggle against enemies provided living teaching materials for criticism. Liu Shaoqi's series of counter-revolutionary crimes were criticized to the point of being unbearable, and hidden class enemies were flushed out from dark corners. Many "hard-to-handle" units also pulled out the nails that hindered production development, and righteousness prevailed, making revolution and production hot and lively.

**Establish the Thought of Farming for the Revolution**

Chairman Mao teaches: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." Criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of the fusion of public and private interests and establishing the thought of being "completely" and "thoroughly" for the revolution is an important link in promoting the great development of agriculture.

Is farming for the revolution or for personal gain? This is the struggle between public and private interests in agricultural production.

The revolutionary committee of Nantong Special District seized on this issue, criticized Liu Shaoqi's theory of the fusion of public and private interests, exposed the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the former regional and county committees who resisted the policy of "grain as the key link" and peddled the black goods of revisionist material incentives. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, started from class education, grasped class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and on the basis of raising the ideological awareness of the broad masses, seriously carried out the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism, solved the problem of public and private relations in agricultural production, and made breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit the ideological foundation for the development of agriculture. This has brought about a great change in people's spiritual outlook. In the past, some members did not work hard when they went out to work, but now they work hard and contribute their wisdom. In the past, some members of the communes along the river and the coast often abandoned collective production during the busy season to go fishing and catch shrimp. This year, they fought against selfishness in the revolutionary criticism, put down their fishing gear, picked up their hoes, and participated in collective production labor.

**Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit of Striving for the Highest Level**

Criticizing Liu Shaoqi's philosophy of "crawling" and continuously educating the broad masses with the spirit of striving for the highest level and daring to scale new heights in production is another reason for Nantong Special District's double harvest of grain and cotton this year.

This year, when discussing production targets, some people said, "Our annual production is not low, our income is not small, and our contribution is not small. It's good enough to maintain the status quo." In response to this conservative thinking, the revolutionary committees at various places strengthened the ideological education of the broad masses to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, making the broad cadres and masses establish the idea of "standing at the mouth of the Yangtze River, looking at Tiananmen, standing on the coast of Huanghai, thinking of the whole world." They linked the specific actions of doing a good job in agricultural production with the great ideal of making contributions to the socialist revolution and construction of the motherland and to the world revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the San Yu area of Nantong learned from Chairman Mao's discussions on thorough revolution and continuous revolution, criticized Liu Shaoqi's philosophy of "crawling," and implemented the production plan with high standards and strict requirements. In the struggle practice, they overcame one difficulty after another, increasing the yield of cotton per mu by more than 20% this year.

In the battle to achieve a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, a prominent problem in Nantong Special District was the shortage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In the face of this difficulty, they broke the theory of "seeing things but not people," insisted on taking the Dazhai road, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and relied on their own strength to implement various measures to deal with drought, waterlogging, and pests. They lacked fertilizer, so they launched an offensive on soil fertilizer; they lacked pesticides, so they mobilized the masses to prevent and treat diseases and pests. Qidong County used 68 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu for cotton last year, but this year it only used 17 jin per mu, yet the cotton yield this year was higher than last year.

**Trust the Masses, Rely on the Masses, and Respect the Masses' Initiative**

Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes," and "the people have limitless creativity." The revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's mass line in developing cotton production. They organized the masses to criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the masses being backward." Now that new creations have appeared among the masses, the revolutionary committees immediately conducted in-depth investigations and research with great enthusiasm, provided strong support, and actively promoted them. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the San Yu area created advanced experiences in treating pests by using lamps to attract moths and besieging the pests' nests. The revolutionary committee immediately promoted this from point to surface. During the period when the moths appeared, the entire Jianghai cotton area was illuminated with tens of thousands of lamps, launching a mass movement to prevent and treat pests. This not only reduced pest damage but also saved pesticides, reducing the cost of agricultural production.

Based on the summary of the mass experiences in achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Nantong Special District have decided to organize a new leap in agricultural production as an important content of implementing the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At present, a new high tide of criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi is sweeping through the entire district, urban and rural areas. In the high tide of criticism, winter production is being carried out vigorously, the scale of agricultural basic construction is unprecedented, and more than 200,000 people throughout the district have participated in water conservancy construction. Winter field management is also being carried out earlier and more solidly than in previous years. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the district have leveled nearly one million mu of land in conjunction with autumn sowing, determined to achieve an even greater bumper harvest in agricultural production next year and welcome the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.
