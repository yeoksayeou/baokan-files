Workers of Shangshe Store in Xingguo County, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people," have brought the store to the doorsteps of poor and lower-middle peasants. Each production brigade has a store, greatly conveniencing the poor and lower-middle peasants, saving a lot of labor, promoting the thought revolutionization of commercial personnel, and receiving the enthusiastic welcome of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 17th: The revolutionary workers of the state-run Shangshe Store in Changgang Commune of Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, have learned from the revolutionary tradition of Shangshe Consumers' Cooperative praised by Chairman Mao during his investigation in Changgang. They have been eager to address the urgent needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants and to think about the production brigades. Since the second half of 1966, they have successively established three branch stores, three branch sales outlets, and six purchasing and selling points in nine brigades of the entire commune, ensuring that each brigade has a store. Brigades with scattered residences have two stores. This way, the store has been brought to the doorsteps of the poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the poor and lower-middle peasants and production brigades.

The benefits of this approach are as follows:

First, it solves the inconvenience of poor and lower-middle peasants in buying and selling, further embodying the Party and Chairman Mao's intimate care for the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, brigades without stores, when community members wanted to sell a few eggs, buy a box of matches, or half a pound of kerosene, they had to go to Shangshe Town. The farthest, Shiyan Brigade, had to travel over twenty miles, which was very inconvenient. Now that brigades have stores, they not only sell goods but also purchase, operating day and night. Poor and lower-middle peasants can go to the store in the morning, evening, or during midday rest. In Jilei Brigade, poor peasant community member Xie Huasen's young son suddenly had a high fever one night, and he was able to buy "Baby Peace" from the store at his doorstep, which worked immediately. Xie Huasen told everyone, "Chairman Mao cares the most about us poor and lower-middle peasants. I will educate my son to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao." The store coming to the brigade also saves a lot of labor. Just for buying fertilizer, the entire commune saved over three thousand labor days this year.

Second, it earnestly implements Chairman Mao's policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply." In the past, stores were located in the town, and the clerks sold whatever was on the shelves and purchased whatever the community members and production brigades brought to sell. As for how to "develop the economy and ensure supply," no one understood the situation or considered it much. After the store was moved to the brigade, the clerks directly understood the production situation of the production brigades and directly heard the voices and demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They could earnestly implement the policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply," actively do a good job in supply and marketing, and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants and collective production. The branch store in Tangshi Brigade saw that many community members' manure buckets were broken, so they told the procurement personnel to transport a batch of wooden planks from over sixty miles away in the mountains, timely supplying the community members' need for repairs. This place produces tung nuts and black tung nuts, both of which can be used as industrial oil. In the past, it was inconvenient for the store to be in the town, and three or two pounds were not purchased, resulting in a lot of waste. After the store was moved to the brigade, the clerks saw this situation and changed the purchasing method, actively requesting each production brigade and poor and lower-middle peasants to go up the mountain to pick, purchasing even one or half a pound. This way, the entire commune's annual purchase of tung nuts and black tung nuts increased by four or five times compared to the past, increasing the income of production brigades and poor and lower-middle peasants, and increasing the state's purchase of agricultural and sideline products.

Third, it is beneficial for commercial personnel to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting thought and work revolutionization. Some commercial personnel used to be accustomed to sitting in the town's large store, forming old thoughts and old styles such as "sitting in the town and guarding the store" and "waiting for customers to come." After coming to the brigade branch store, they studied and lived with the poor and lower-middle peasants, often participating in collective production labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving great education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, strengthening class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and gradually establishing new thoughts and new styles of wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor peasant community member Tang Mingjin came to the branch store in Hefu Brigade, insisting on studying and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," actively serving the people. The poor and lower-middle peasants could buy at any time, and he would receive them even if they knocked on the door at midnight. During busy farming seasons, he would deliver goods to the fields, selling goods while participating in labor.

Shangshe State-Run Store bringing the store to the doorsteps of the poor and lower-middle peasants is a result of the great thought of Mao Zedong occupying the commercial front, and a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A long time ago, some revolutionary workers proposed to bring the store to each brigade based on the requirements of the poor and lower-middle peasants, but due to the obstruction of capitalist roaders, it was not realized. In the second half of 1966, revolutionary workers seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders, smashed the enemy's sabotage plot, and insisted on bringing the store to the brigades one by one. In the process of reform, revolutionary workers also severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by Liu Shaoqi in commercial work, earnestly using Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people" to demand of themselves, and their thought revolutionization has greatly improved.

    兴国县上社商店职工遵循毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导
    把商店办到贫下中农家门口
    每个生产大队都有商店，极大地方便了贫下中农，节省了很多劳动力，促进了商业人员的思想革命化，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎
    据新华社南昌十七日电　江西省兴国县设在长冈公社的上社国营商店的革命职工，学习毛主席当年在长冈调查时表扬的上社消费合作社的革命传统，急贫下中农所急，想生产队所想，从一九六六年下半年起先后在全公社的九个大队内，办起三个分店、三个分销店、六个代购代销店，使每个大队都有了一个商店，居住分散的大队还有两个商店的。这样把商店办到了贫下中农家门口，受到贫下中农和生产队的热烈欢迎。
    这种做法的好处有：第一、解决了贫下中农买卖不方便的困难，进一步体现了党和毛主席对贫下中农的亲切关怀。过去，大队没有商店，社员要卖几个鸡蛋，买盒火柴，打半斤煤油，都要跑到上社镇来，最远的石燕大队要跑二十几里路，很不方便。现在，大队有了商店，既售货又收购，日夜开门，贫下中农早晨、晚上或中午休息时间都可以上趟商店。集瑞大队贫农社员谢华森的小儿子晚上突然发高烧，当晚在家门口商店买到“小儿安”，一吃就好了。谢华森逢人便说：“毛主席最关心我们贫下中农。我要教育我的儿子，要永远忠于毛主席。”商店办到了大队，还节省了许多劳动力。仅买化肥一项，全公社今年就节省了三千多个劳动日。
    第二、认真贯彻了毛主席的“发展经济，保障供给”的方针。过去，商店设在镇上，架子上有什么货，营业员就卖什么，社员和生产队拿什么产品来卖，营业员就收购什么。至于怎样去“发展经济，保障供给”，大家既不了解情况，也很少考虑。把商店办到大队后，营业员直接了解生产队的生产情况，直接听到贫下中农的呼声和要求，就能认真贯彻执行“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，积极做好供销工作，为贫下中农和集体生产服务。设在塘石大队的分店的营业员，看到许多社员生产用的粪桶坏了，就告诉采购人员从六十多里外的山区运来一批木板子，及时供应了社员修理的需要。这里出产桐子、乌桕子，都可作工业用的油料。过去商店设在镇上不方便，三斤两斤又不收购，结果浪费了许多。商店办到大队后，营业员看到这一情况，就改变收购方法，主动要求各生产队和贫下中农上山采摘，一斤半斤都收购。这样，全社每年收购的桐子和乌桕子比过去增加了四、五倍，既增加了生产队和贫下中农的收入，又为国家增购了农副产品。
    第三、有利于商业人员向贫下中农学习，促进了思想和工作革命化。有的商业人员过去坐惯了镇子大店，形成了“坐镇守店”、“等客上门”等旧思想、旧作风。到了大队分店以后，他们和贫下中农学习在一起，生活在一起，还常和贫下中农一起参加集体生产劳动，从贫下中农身上受到很大教育，增强了和贫下中农的阶级感情，逐步树立起全心全意为贫下中农服务的新思想、新作风。贫农出身的营业员唐明金来到合富大队分店以后，坚持活学活用“老三篇”，积极为人民服务，贫下中农随到随买，半夜敲门也接待，农忙时送货到田，一边卖货，一边参加劳动。
    上社国营商店把商店办到贫下中农家门口，是伟大的毛泽东思想占领商业阵地的成果，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利。很早以前，一些革命职工就根据贫下中农的要求，提出要把商店办到各个大队去，由于走资派拦阻，没有实现。一九六六年下半年，革命职工向一小撮走资派夺了权，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，坚持把商店一个个办到大队去。在进行改革过程中，革命职工还狠批了刘少奇在商业工作中推行的反革命修正主义黑货，认真用毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导来要求自己，思想革命化有了很大提高。
