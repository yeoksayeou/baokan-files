The story introduced here is about two soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who sacrificed their lives to protect workers, and workers and peasants who risked their lives to rescue the soldiers. This is a vivid example of the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a song of praise for the widespread popularization of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

“The PLA is truly good”

In early October of this year, two soldiers from the Armored Forces of the Jinan Military Region, Chen Guocai and Xuan Zhaocai, were on a motorcycle delivering documents from the headquarters to convey the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. In the afternoon, around two o'clock, they were returning to the headquarters. As they approached a scissor-shaped intersection, the purple willows and freshly harvested corn stalks on the side of the road obstructed Chen Guocai's view. He was about to turn left when he suddenly saw a fuel tanker speeding towards him from the left. Despite both the motorcycle and the truck braking hard, due to inertia, they couldn't stop in time. It seemed inevitable that the two vehicles would collide. Chen Guocai immediately decided to change the motorcycle's direction and turn right to avoid the truck. However, just as he was turning right, he suddenly noticed three workers squatting a few meters ahead, setting up road signs. In this critical moment where avoiding the truck would mean hitting the workers, and avoiding the workers would mean hitting the truck, Chen Guocai, this eighteen-year-old new soldier, recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai." With a great spirit of self-sacrifice to protect the masses, he resolutely steered the motorcycle towards the truck...

The three workers were saved, but Chen Guocai's left leg was severely injured, and Xuan Zhaocai was thrown out of the motorcycle, fainting.

The three rescued workers and the driver of the fuel tanker immediately rushed over to rescue them. An old worker, tears in his eyes, said, "The PLA trained by Chairman Mao is truly good! A million times good!"

Xuan Zhaocai regained consciousness, feeling intense pain in his abdomen. As a Communist Party member, he gritted his teeth, pressed his hand to his abdomen, and stood up, saying, "I'm fine, are the worker comrades and the truck driver injured?" When he saw Chen Guocai seriously injured, blood flowing, still tightly gripping the handlebars, he was moved to tears. He said, "Xiao Chen, you did the right thing, you are a good comrade!"

Just then, another fuel tanker passed by. The driver voluntarily took Chen Guocai and Xuan Zhaocai to the hospital for emergency treatment. As the car started, Chen Guocai was shaking from the pain. Xuan Zhaocai immediately took his hand off his abdomen and tightly hugged Chen Guocai, asking, "Xiao Chen, are you in pain?"

Chen Guocai firmly replied, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Xuan Zhaocai excitedly said, "Right! We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely decide, and strive for victory!"

At four o'clock in the afternoon, the car arrived at the military hospital. The driver, tears in his eyes, said to the medical staff, "Doctors, they were injured saving our worker brothers. Please save them!" After saying this, he left without leaving his name or address.

		Class Love Runs Deep

Chen Guocai and Xuan Zhaocai had lost too much blood, and their lives were in grave danger, requiring immediate blood transfusion. However, the hospital had no blood bank. Medical staff rushed to donate blood, saying, "We are the blood bank!" But the first one who needed blood, Chen Guocai, was type O blood, and only one person among the medical staff could donate to him. How could that be enough?

The hospital staff immediately picked up the phone and called for help from all directions.

The loudspeaker at the Shandong Province Zibo City Petroleum Distribution Station boomed, "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people. The military hospital is rescuing soldiers and needs blood..."

At that time, the workers were having dinner. They put down their bowls and chopsticks and rushed out. They thought, "The earlier we donate blood, the safer our comrades' lives will be. Saving one soldier of the People's Liberation Army is adding strength to executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" Instantly, groups of workers, panting, and bicycles pedaling quickly, surged towards the hospital like a tide...

The rain fell heavier, and the people ran faster. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, workers and poor peasants from all directions rushed to the hospital. The hospital was filled with black bicycles, and the corridors and passages were crowded with people donating blood. Many stood outside under the eaves, getting wet in the rain while waiting to donate.

		"I came early, test mine!"
		"I'm healthy, test mine first!"

One after another, those who passed the test walked into the laboratory to donate blood. "Shu Shouyan, Shu Shouyan is type O blood!" Following the nurse's call, the leader of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at the Petroleum Distribution Station, Shu Shouyan, pushed his way out of the crowd. Ever since the worker propaganda team entered the station, Old Shu had been leading everyone day and night in the struggle, criticism, and reform, his eyes red from lack of sleep. The workers couldn't stop him, so they begged the doctor, "The injured soldiers need as much blood as we can provide, please don't take Old Shu's!"

Just at this moment, a poor peasant comrade pushed forward and said loudly, "The blood needed by the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, we poor and lower-middle peasants will take care of it all!"

The workers' and peasants' red blood flowed continuously into Chen Guocai and Xuan Zhaocai's hearts. The two soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were saved. It was already six o'clock the next morning.

The sun rose in the east, and the sky was filled with rays of light. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers won this battle of rescue.

		The Mother's Wish

On October 16th, Chen Guocai's mother rushed from her hometown in Jiangsu Province, Shazhou County, Heqing Commune to visit him. The over fifty-year-old Chen Grandma had a red Mao Zedong Quotations bag on her back and a shining Mao Zedong badge on her chest.

Chen Grandma saw that her son had lost a leg, and she was not a little sad. But Chen Grandma had experienced the bitterness of the old society and tasted the sweetness of the new society. She understood that revolution was more important than her son, and class feelings were more precious than motherly love. She was happy that her son had listened to Chairman Mao's words and saved the lives of three class brothers with his blood. Chen Grandma affectionately said to Chen Guocai, "Guocai, you listened to Chairman Mao's words, you did the right thing! For the revolution, losing a leg is also glorious, you don't have to be sad!" After saying this, Chen Grandma went to Xuan Zhaocai's bed and, like a mother to her own son, affectionately comforted Xuan Zhaocai, praising him for being selfless and dedicated to others, a good comrade. The military doctors and nurses heard her praising Xuan Zhaocai and said to Chen Grandma, "Chen Guocai risked his life to save others, he is also a good comrade, you have such a good son, it's very glorious!" Chen Grandma quickly shook her head, "I have nothing, it's all thanks to Chairman Mao's education!"

The next day, Chen Grandma voluntarily went to visit the truck driver who had hit Chen Guocai. Chen Grandma comforted him, "We are all bitter gourds on the same vine, you don't have to be sad, you must listen to Chairman Mao's words and drive well for the revolution." The truck driver was so moved that he couldn't say a word, holding up the Little Red Book and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Chen Guocai's critical period had not yet passed, and Chen Grandma left the hospital. Before leaving, she repeatedly encouraged Chen Guocai, "Losing a leg is nothing! As long as you have a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao, you can still revolutionize! In three more years, I will send your younger brother to the army." Saying this, Chen Grandma turned to everyone, "I have four little grandsons, when they grow up, I will send them all to the army to follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize to the end!"

    毛泽东思想大普及的一曲颂歌
    这里介绍的，是两位解放军战士用生命保护工人，工农群众用鲜血抢救解放军战士的一个生动的故事
    最近，在山东省周村地区传诵着解放军战士用生命保护工人，工农群众用鲜血抢救解放军战士的一个动人的故事。这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个成果，是伟大的毛泽东思想大普及的一曲颂歌。
        “解放军真好”
    今年十月上旬的一天，济南部队装甲兵某团摩托通讯员陈国才和收发员轩昭彩，从团部乘摩托到某地递送文件，传达无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。下午两点多钟，他们返回团部，行至一个剪刀形的交叉路口时，路边的紫穗槐和刚收割的玉米秸，挡住了陈国才的视线，他刚要向左转弯，突然发现左边公路上有一辆油罐车急速地开过来，尽管摩托和汽车都赶快紧急刹车，但由于惯性作用，仍然停不住车，眼看两车就要相撞，陈国才立即决定改变摩托的行进方向，向右转，让开油车。但是，正当他向右转的时候，突然又发现右前方几米远的地方有三个工人正蹲在路边设置路标。就在这不碰车就要碰人、不碰人就要碰车的紧急关头，陈国才——这个年仅十八岁的新战士，想起毛主席“为人民而死，就是死得其所”的伟大教导，毅然以牺牲自己，保护群众的大无畏精神，向汽车滑去……
    三名工人脱险了，陈国才的左腿却被严重撞伤，轩昭彩也被撞出车斗四米多远，摔得昏迷过去。
    被救的三个工人和油罐车上的驾驶员，立即拥上来抢救。老工人激动得含着热泪说：“毛主席教育出来的解放军真好！一万个好！”
    轩昭彩从昏迷中醒来，只觉得肚子里剧烈疼痛。他，这个共产党员，咬着牙，按着肚子，爬起来的第一句话就是：“我不要紧，工人同志和汽车驾驶员同志受伤了没有？”当他看到陈国才身负重伤，鲜血直流，还双手紧握车把坚守战斗岗位，激动得“刷”地流下了热泪。他说：“小陈，你做得对，你是个好同志！”
    这时，后面又来了一辆过路的油罐车，车上的驾驶员主动把陈国才、轩昭彩送到医院抢救。汽车开动后，陈国才疼得直打颤。轩昭彩立即把捂着肚子的那只手拿出来，紧紧抱住陈国才，关切地问：“小陈，疼吗？”
    陈国才坚定地回答：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    轩昭彩激动地说：“对！我们要按照毛主席的教导，下定决心，去争取胜利！”
    下午四点，汽车开到驻军医院。驾驶员含着热泪对医务人员说：“医生同志，他俩是为了救咱工人兄弟受的伤，你们千万要把他们治好啊！”说完，连姓名、地址都不肯留就开着车子走了。
              阶级友爱深
    陈国才、轩昭彩失血过多，生命十分危险，需要立即输血。但是医院没有血库。医务人员纷纷赶来献血说：“我们就是血库！”可是首先需要输血的陈国才是ｏ型血，医务人员中能给他输血的只有一个人，这怎么够呢！
    医院的工作人员立即拿起电话向四面八方求援。
    山东省淄博市石油批发站的广播筒响起了宏亮的声音：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。解放军医院抢救战士需要输血……。”
    当时站上正在开晚饭，工人们放下碗筷，拔腿就跑。他们想：“早献一滴血，亲人的生命就多一分安全。抢救一名解放军战士，就是为执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线增添一份力量！”顿时，一群群跑得气喘喘的工人，一辆辆蹬得飞快的自行车，潮水般地涌向医院……
    雨越下越紧，人越跑越急。在伟大的毛泽东思想指挥下，广大工人和贫下中农从四面八方奔向医院。医院里，自行车黑压压地摆了一院子，献血的人群把走廊、通道挤得满满的，很多人站在屋外房檐下淋着雨等候献血。
      “我来得早，验我的！”
      “我身体好，先验我的！”
    化验合格的人一个接一个地走进化验科去献血。“术守岩，术守岩是ｏ型血！”随着护士的喊声，驻石油批发站的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的负责人术守岩从人群中挤出来。自打工人宣传队一进站，老术就没日没夜地领着大伙搞斗、批、改，两眼熬得通红。工人们拦不住，只好恳求医生说：“伤员需要多少血，由我们输，千万不能要老术的！”
    正在这时候，一位贫农社员挤向前来大声说：“解放军伤员需要的血，我们贫下中农全包了！”
    工农群众的鲜红的血源源不断地流进陈国才和轩昭彩的心脏。两位解放军战士得救了。这时，已是第二天早晨六点钟。
    旭日东升，霞光万道。广大工农兵群众在毛泽东思想指挥下，赢得了这场抢救的胜利。
      母亲的心愿
    十月十六日，陈国才的母亲从家乡江苏省沙洲县合兴公社赶来探望。五十多岁的陈大娘身上背着鲜红的毛主席语录袋，胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章。
    陈大娘看儿子少了一条腿，她不是一点不难过。但是，陈大娘吃过旧社会的苦，尝到新社会的甜，她懂得：革命比儿子重要，阶级情比母子情珍贵。她为儿子能听毛主席的话，用鲜血保护了三位阶级兄弟的生命安全而高兴。陈大娘亲切地对陈国才说：“国才，你听毛主席的话，你做得对！为了革命，少一条腿也是光荣的，你不要难过！”说完，陈大娘就走到轩昭彩床边，象对亲儿子一样，亲切地慰问轩昭彩，夸他毫不利己专门利人，是个好同志。军医、护士听她赞扬轩昭彩，就对陈大娘说：“陈国才舍己救人，也是个好同志，你有这么好的儿子，很光荣呀！”陈大娘连忙摇头：“我有什么，全靠毛主席教育得好啊！”
    第二天，陈大娘主动去看望撞伤陈国才的那个汽车驾驶员。陈大娘安慰他：“我们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，你不要难过，一定要听毛主席的话，为革命开好汽车。”汽车司机激动得一句话也说不出来，举起红色宝书高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    陈国才的危险期还没有过，陈大娘就离开了医院。临走前她再三鼓励陈国才：“少一条腿算什么！只要有一颗忠于毛主席的红心，照样干革命！再过三年，我把你弟弟也送到部队。”说着，陈大娘转过脸对大家说：“我还有四个小孙孙，长大了都送到部队来，跟着毛主席革命到底！”
