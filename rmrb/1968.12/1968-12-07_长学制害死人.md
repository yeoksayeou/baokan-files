	Long Schooling System Kills People
	“Anti-Japanese Military and Political University” Agricultural School Student Chen Yuanchao

	Under the rule of Liu Shaoqi’s counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, it is as difficult for us poor and lower-middle peasants’ children to enter school as it is to climb to the sky. Without money, one cannot attend school; with low scores, one cannot enter school; even age has become a barrier to entering school. What is even more intolerable is that they drag out the schooling system, preventing poor and lower-middle peasants’ children from entering school. Liu Shaoqi once issued a black directive: “In the future, can we implement a five-year, six-year, seven-year, or eight-year system? Establish a university, let students learn more, and do not let them become half-baked scholars.” Liu Shaoqi’s black henchmen like Lou Dingyi took their master’s black words as sacred decrees, making the schooling system very long. From primary school to university graduation, it takes sixteen to twenty years. And primary school admission is only allowed at the age of seven. With such a schooling system, a person would be over twenty years old by the time they graduate from university. Our poor and lower-middle peasants have been illiterate for generations, and we hope the schooling system can be shorter so that our children can learn for a period and then participate in production labor early. However, some children, due to late admission, are already sixteen or seventeen years old by the time they graduate from primary school. The school then treats them as “over-age students,” making it even harder for them to enter the next level of school. This is truly: “The school gate faces outward, but it’s difficult for poor and lower-middle peasants’ children to enter.” Such a schooling system is only welcomed by landlords and rich peasants, allowing their children to study and become officials, emerging from school as “experts” and “scholars.” Liu Shaoqi wants to deprive the educational rights of the laboring people, who make up more than 90% of the population, and do everything possible to serve the needs of a few landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists. He is a genuine representative of the bourgeoisie.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao cares the most about us poor and lower-middle peasants and understands us the best. Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the “Sixteen Points,” which point out: “Reforming the old educational system, teaching guidelines, and methods is an extremely important task of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.” He issued the directive: “Schooling should be shortened, and education should be revolutionized.” Under Chairman Mao’s wise guidance, we have thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi, this bad guy, and broken through the blockade of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, establishing our own school for poor and lower-middle peasants—“Anti-Japanese Military and Political University” Agricultural School. Our school has only a two-year schooling system, and students do not leave production labor. I believe that such a school is in line with Chairman Mao’s proletarian educational line. In the future, we will more firmly follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, becoming genuine “three-in-one” personnel at the “Anti-Japanese Military and Political University” Agricultural School: propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, fighters in class struggle, and technicians in agricultural production.

    长学制害死人
    “抗大”农校学员　陈元朝
    在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的统治下，我们贫下中农子女入学比登天还难，没有钱上不了学，分数低入不了学，甚至连年龄也成了入学的“关”。尤其不能容忍的是，他们把学制拖得长长的，不让贫下中农子女入学。刘少奇曾下黑指示说：“将来是否可以搞五年、六年，七、八年。办成大学，让学生多学一点，不要学成半吊子。”刘少奇的黑爪牙陆定一之流，把黑主子的黑话当圣旨，把学校的学制搞得很长，从上小学到大学毕业，要十六年到二十年。而小学非要到七周岁才准入学。象这样的学制，一个人到大学毕业时就已经二十多岁了。我们贫下中农祖祖辈辈不识字，多么希望学制短一些，好让子女学了一个时期以后，早些参加生产劳动啊！可是，有的孩子由于入学迟，到小学毕业时，已是十六、七岁的人了，学校又把他当作“超龄生”处理，就更入不了高一级学校。这真是：“学校大门朝外开，贫下中农子女难进来。”这样的学制，只有地主、富农欢迎，让他们的子女读书做官，一出学校就成为“专家”、“学者”。刘少奇妄想剥夺占人口总数百分之九十以上的劳动人民的教育权利，千方百计为少数地主、富农、资本家的需要服务。他是道道地地的资产阶级的总代表。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最关心我们贫下中农，最了解我们贫下中农。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法，是这场无产阶级文化大革命的一个极其重要的任务。”他老人家发出指示：“学制要缩短，教育要革命”。在毛主席的英明指示下，我们大造了刘少奇这个坏家伙的反，冲破了反革命修正主义教育路线的封锁，办起了我们贫下中农自己的学校——“抗大”农校。我们的学校学制只有两年，学生不脱离生产劳动。我认为，象我们这样的学校，才符合毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。今后我们要更坚定地沿着毛主席指引的方向前进，在“抗大”农校做一个名副其实的三员：毛泽东思想宣传员，阶级斗争战斗员，农业生产技术员。
