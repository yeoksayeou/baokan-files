Intellectual Youth to the Countryside

“Intellectuals must unite with the workers and peasants, or they will achieve nothing.” Intellectual youth who have settled in the Linchang Brigade of the Wanjia Commune in Jin County, Liaoning, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, becoming their students. Under the patient guidance of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they gradually mastered some agricultural techniques. This is a poor peasant community member teaching them the essentials of farm work.

The poor and lower-middle pastoral community members of the Inner Mongolian grasslands welcome the urban intellectual youth who have come to settle with deep proletarian feelings. This is a community member of the Narengol League in Abaga Banner, Inner Mongolia, carefully arranging a new Mongolian yurt for the incoming "new community members."

Chairman Mao calls: “All intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should gladly go there. The countryside is a vast expanse where great things can be accomplished.” Beijing intellectual youth Cai Lijian, who has settled in the Dujiashan Production Team of the Xihe Brigade in the Huangcai Commune of Yuxian County, Shanxi Province, follows Chairman Mao’s great teachings and humbly learns from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is her studying the “Quotations from Chairman Mao” with the brigade leader Yan Yinzhi in the fields.

A group of urban intellectual youth have come to the broad expanse of the People’s Commune in Jiongxian County, Henan Province, to settle and make a home. The returned intellectual youth Lu Zhongyang from this commune first leads them in studying Chairman Mao’s brilliant comments on the experience of cooperativization in Dali Village, Jiongxian County. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao’s teachings and grow in the vast expanse of the countryside into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.
