Chairman Mao's Great Concern for Us Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Rain nourishes the seedlings, and all things grow with the help of the sun. Without Chairman Mao, we would be like crops in a drought that do not bear ears, or withered seedlings that do not take root. In a word, without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for us peasants of all nationalities. We have heard from the radio that the poor and lower-middle peasants of Le Yuan Commune in Changyang County, Hubei Province, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian health line, have broken through Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the health sector and created a new cooperative medical system, successfully solving the problem of poor and lower-middle peasants seeing a doctor and taking medicine. This is truly the best thing that could happen and is exactly what we poor and lower-middle peasants want. With hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, we shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao forever!

In the old society, we never saw doctors who would treat us poor people. At that time, if a poor person fell ill, they could only suffer. If someone working for a landlord or rich peasant fell ill, they would be kicked out by the landlord or rich peasant. Chairman Mao rescued us from the dry well and made our lives happier and happier. However, the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi wanted to restore capitalism and pushed a revisionist line in the health sector, not allowing medical workers to serve us poor and lower-middle peasants.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, city hospitals had signs that said "People's Hospital," but in reality, they served only a few people. When we poor and lower-middle peasants went to big hospitals in the city to see a doctor, we would enter the hospital's gate, see all the signs, ask around, and still not find our way. Doctors wore big masks, wore white coats, and would not answer questions. If you asked too many questions, they would get angry. Originally, being sick was already unpleasant, and some doctors would make you even more upset. In the commune, some doctors had low skills but big airs. Poor and lower-middle peasants seeing a doctor and taking medicine had to depend on their moods. Is this serving the people? This is all the poison of the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism, and we must thoroughly purge it.

Implementing the cooperative medical system fully reflects the great concern of our great leader Chairman Mao for us peasants of all nationalities. We fully support it. We welcome revolutionary medical workers to come to the countryside to settle down.

    毛主席对我们贫下中农的巨大关怀
    雨露滋润禾苗壮，万物生长靠太阳。没有毛主席，我们就象干旱的庄稼不出穗，干枯的树苗不生根。一句话，没有毛主席，就没有我们各族贫下中农的今天。我们从广播里听到了湖北省长阳县乐园公社的贫下中农，在毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线的指引下，冲破了刘少奇在卫生战线上的反革命修正主义路线，创造了一种崭新的合作医疗制度，成功地解决了贫下中农看病吃药的问题。这真是再好也没有了，真正合乎我们贫下中农的心思。我们怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的心情，千遍万遍地高呼：敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    在旧社会里，从来没有见过为我们穷人看病的医生。那时候，穷人得了病，只能受罪，给地主、富农扛活的得了病，就被地主、富农赶出门外。毛主席他老人家从枯井里把我们搭救出来，使我们的光景越来越幸福。可是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，妄想复辟资本主义，在卫生战线上也推行修正主义路线，不让医务工作者为我们贫下中农服务。
    在无产阶级文化大革命以前，城里医院挂的牌牌叫什么“人民医院”，实际上是为少数人服务的。我们贫下中农到城里的大医院看病，走进医院的大门，门门牌牌，东问西找，连门路也找不到。医生捂个大口罩，穿个白大褂，一问三不答，多问就恼火。本来得病就不高兴，有的医生还把你气个够。公社里有的医生也是技术不高，架子不小，贫下中农看病吃药，还得看他们气顺。这难道是为人民服务的吗？这都是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义的流毒，我们一定要彻底肃清。
    实行合作医疗制度，充分体现了伟大领袖毛主席对我们各族贫下中农的巨大关怀。我们各族贫下中农一千个拥护，一万个拥护。我们欢迎革命的医务工作者到农村来安家落户。
