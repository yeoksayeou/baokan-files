The U.S. imperialists are accelerating their steps towards fascism within their own country. They are intensifying the machinery of bourgeois dictatorship, implementing more brutal terror and bloody suppression against the American people, turning the United States into a vast prison.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1949: "The governments of Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Franco, and Chiang Kai-shek either abolished or simply did not use the curtain of bourgeois democracy within their own country, because class struggle had reached an extreme point, and abolishing or simply not using the curtain was more advantageous, preventing the people from using it to dance wildly." Chairman Mao also predicted at that time that U.S. imperialism would inevitably follow this path.

The facts have proven this to be true!

Since the end of the war, U.S. imperialism has been acting as the "international police," madly suppressing the people of various countries. However, within the United States, it has been trying to maintain a respectable appearance, using the curtain of "democracy" to cover up its brutal rule. However, with the intensification of class struggle within the United States, this curtain has long been torn to shreds by the U.S. ruling class itself. Now, as U.S. imperialism further accelerates its fascistization and launches a savage attack on the people, it has completely exposed its savage face.

The U.S. ruling class is hastening the implementation of fascism, which is a reflection of the deepening political and economic crisis of U.S. imperialism and a necessary result of the rapid development of the revolutionary struggle of the American people. In recent years, the black people's anti-violence struggle, workers' movements, and student movements in the United States have been like surging waves, one after another, fiercely assaulting the reactionary rule of the U.S. monopoly bourgeoisie. The U.S. ruling class cannot stop this surging tide with deception, and can only hope to use bayonets to maintain their throne. Therefore, the strengthening of fascist dictatorship within the United States by U.S. imperialism does not indicate its strength but rather its weakness. This is a sign of U.S. imperialism's declining days.

Fascism is itself a product of the decay of the imperialist system, and the implementation of fascism will inevitably accelerate the collapse of the imperialist system. The U.S. imperialists' use of open violence to carry out brutal rule will greatly help to dispel the illusions of the masses about bourgeois democracy, promote the further awakening of the American people, and make them realize that only revolutionary violence can be used to counter revolutionary violence to achieve true liberation. Fascist dictatorship cannot extinguish the revolutionary movement of the American people but will only create a more powerful gravedigger for U.S. imperialism itself. Fascism could not save Hitler from his downfall, and it will similarly not be able to save U.S. imperialism from its ultimate demise!

    美帝加速走向坟墓的步伐
    美帝国主义正在国内加速法西斯化的步伐。它变本加厉地强化资产阶级专政的机器，对美国人民实行更残暴的恐怖统治和血腥镇压，把美国变成为一个大监狱。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在一九四九年就曾经指出：“希特勒、墨索里尼、东条、佛郎哥、蒋介石等人的政府取消了或者索性不用那片资产阶级内部民主的幕布，是因为国内阶级斗争紧张到了极点，取消或者索性不用那片布比较地有利些，免得人民也利用那片布去手舞足蹈。”毛主席当时并且预言，美帝国主义也必然要走上这条道路。
    事实果然如此！
    战后以来，美帝国主义一直充当“国际宪兵”，疯狂地镇压各国人民。但是，它在美国国内却竭力装出一副体面的样子，用“民主”的幕布来掩盖它的残暴统治。然而，随着美国国内阶级斗争的日益尖锐化，这片幕布早就被美国统治集团自己扯得支离破碎了。现在，美帝国主义进一步加速法西斯化，向人民发动野蛮的进攻，这就赤裸裸地暴露出它的凶残面目。
    美国统治集团加紧实行法西斯化，是美帝国主义政治经济危机急剧深化的一种反映，是美国人民革命斗争迅猛发展的必然结果。近年来，美国的黑人抗暴斗争、工人运动、学生运动有如汹涌的怒涛，一浪接一浪，猛烈地冲击着美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。美国统治集团靠欺骗阻挡不住这股澎湃的洪流，只有指望用刺刀来维持自己的宝座。因此，美帝国主义在国内加强法西斯专政，决不表明它的强大，而是表明它的虚弱。这正是美帝国主义日暮途穷的征象。
    法西斯主义本来就是帝国主义制度没落的产物，而实行法西斯主义又必然加速帝国主义制度的崩溃。美帝国主义用公开的暴力进行残暴的统治，这就会大大有利于破除群众对资产阶级民主的幻想，促进美国人民的进一步觉醒，使他们更加认识到，只有用革命的暴力来对付反革命的暴力，才能获得真正的解放。法西斯专政不可能扑灭美国人民的革命运动，而只会给美帝国主义自己造成更强大的掘墓人。法西斯主义没有能够挽救希特勒的覆灭，也同样不能挽救美帝国主义的最后灭亡！
