The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Jilin Provincial People's Hospital has mobilized medical staff to vigorously carry out revolutionary criticism and reform unreasonable medical systems. They criticize and reform simultaneously, using criticism to drive reform. The consciousness of medical staff continues to improve, and the hospital's appearance has been completely transformed. The masses praise: "This time, the People's Hospital truly belongs to the people."

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Jilin Provincial People's Hospital, together with the Revolutionary Committee, leads the hospital in a thorough revolutionary spirit to carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform. They lead the masses to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, carry out revolutionary criticism, criticize and reform simultaneously, using criticism to drive reform. They thoroughly criticize the bourgeois medical system and establish a medical system that serves the broad laboring masses, making the hospital's appearance completely transformed.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois "authorities" had long held power in this hospital, stubbornly pushing the revisionist medical and health line, and formulating various rules and regulations to make it difficult for workers and poor and lower-middle peasants who came to seek treatment for their illnesses. Under the influence of the revisionist medical and health line, many medical staff also developed the bourgeois old practices of "treating the disease, not the person" and "following the rules, not the class."

After the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the hospital, they were very indignant about this situation. They decided to use the proletarian spirit to thoroughly reform the hospital and make the People's Hospital truly serve the broad laboring masses.

How to use the proletarian spirit to thoroughly reform the hospital and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the hospital? The Workers' Propaganda Team and members of the Revolutionary Committee studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "A new social system must be established on the basis of the old system, and it must clear away this basis" repeatedly. They realized that although the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party had been overthrown, the old rules and regulations that served them still existed. The old ideas and practices in the minds of the broad medical staff had not been thoroughly changed, and the issue of whom to serve had not been resolved. Therefore, solving this problem became the key to smoothly promoting the struggle, criticism, and reform of the hospital.

The Workers' Propaganda Team seized this problem and mobilized all the revolutionary staff in the hospital to use various forms to carry out a thorough criticism of the revisionist medical and health line. This hospital previously opened the door wide for a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois lords, specially setting up "high-level wards," "special clinics," and "special medicine cabinets." However, when laboring people came to the hospital for treatment, they lived in a so-called "temporary ward" made from an old warehouse that did not block the wind or keep out the rain. During the criticism, the Workers' Propaganda Team organized all the medical staff in the hospital to visit and compare, and held a criticism meeting on the spot. At the criticism meeting, they compared the treatment and nursing of a capitalist roader within the Party and a poor peasant old man. One was living in a "high-level ward," long-term minor illness, wasting nearly a thousand yuan of various high-grade medicines; the other was living in a "temporary ward" for a month, and was pushed out of the hospital because he could not pay the medical fees. These living facts deeply educated the broad medical staff, making them deeply realize that the issue of whom to treat is not a general issue but a reflection of the struggle between the two classes and two lines in the hospital. Especially those who came from poor peasant families felt it more deeply. They said: The current set of rules and regulations in the hospital is the result of pushing the revisionist line, and it is to suppress the laboring masses. For a long time, we unconsciously executed it. This time, we must thoroughly smash this revisionist medical line and wholeheartedly serve the people.

On the basis of raising the consciousness of the two-line struggle among medical staff, the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team seized the issue of "serving whom" and organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's instruction, compare it with a reactionary fallacy of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi, expose a crime of a capitalist roader in this hospital, purge the poison of revisionism in one aspect, and implement one reform measure. In this way, the more they criticize, the deeper they go, and the faster and more thorough the reform becomes. They achieve one criticism, one smash, and one establishment. In the past, when workers and poor peasants came to the hospital for treatment, they had to go through five procedures: registration, diagnosis, prescription marking price, payment, and medicine pickup, and queue up five times. Especially the registration procedure, the hospital's door only had two very small windows. No matter in the cold winter or hot summer, every day there were more than two thousand people queuing up to register, often having to wait for a long time. The Workers' Propaganda Team organized poor peasant patients and medical staff to hold a criticism meeting in front of the registration room. An old peasant from a hundred miles away angrily said: "These barriers and restrictions are all for the working class, suppressing us poor peasants. The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places want to suppress us poor peasants in medical treatment." Through the on-site criticism, the medical staff's determination to reform unreasonable rules and regulations became even greater. The surgery department first proposed the suggestion and measures to abolish the registration room. This revolutionary action immediately received the full support of the Propaganda Team and was warmly welcomed by the broad workers and poor peasants. But there were also a few people who were afraid of disorder and advocated postponing the reform. The Workers' Propaganda Team said resolutely: "We proletarians have taken control of medical power, and we must completely and thoroughly serve the people, and we must not let the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line continue for even a second." With the help of the Propaganda Team, the surgery medical staff boldly innovated, abolished the registration room, and let patients go directly to the surgery clinic for treatment. The Workers' Propaganda Team also went to the front line with the medical staff, publicizing Chairman Mao's instructions on health work, criticizing unreasonable old rules and regulations, publicizing health knowledge, turning the waiting room and outpatient room into a battlefield for learning Mao Zedong Thought and a battlefield for criticism, resulting in not only no disorder but also educating the patients, which was warmly welcomed by workers and poor peasants.

After the surgery department abolished the registration room, it led other departments to reform a series of unreasonable old rules and regulations. Other departments also simplified the procedures and moved the registration to various clinic rooms. General commonly used medicines were only given to the patient after the doctor's examination, and the nurse could handle the payment. Emergency patients and patients who needed to establish a medical record were directly transferred to the emergency and critical care room by the doctor's certificate, treating the disease first and handling the procedures later. In this way, the five procedures of registration, diagnosis, etc., were completed at once, greatly convenient for the patients, and the time for patients to see a doctor generally did not exceed one hour.

After breaking through various unreasonable old rules and regulations, the Workers' Propaganda Team found that the doctors' workload had increased, while the nurses' workload had relatively decreased. Originally, an old nurse with more than ten years of practical experience could handle general diseases and general surgeries, but the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" only let the nurses do odd jobs and serve the doctors. At this time, the Workers' Propaganda Team mobilized the medical staff to criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of "experts running the hospital," exposing the crimes of the capitalist roaders within the hospital who sealed "authorities" and established "famous doctors," dividing levels and grades, and discriminating against medical staff, making the medical staff realize: In the past, the capitalist roaders within the Party divided levels and grades to cultivate their own successors. The nurse Wang Jue from the ENT department said: "Our goal of serving the people is the same, and there is no high and low, noble and humble. The revisionist line attempts to divide us with levels and grades. We must thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. We must follow the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and stick closer." Through the criticism, the relationship between medical staff became much closer. Doctors could do nursing work, and many experienced nurses could also treat patients, greatly improving work efficiency. The internal medicine department used to have eight hundred people queuing up to register every day, and only two hundred people could be seen. Now, more than five hundred patients can be seen in one morning. The reformed People's Hospital has been warmly welcomed and praised by the broad laboring masses. They happily said: "This time, the People's Hospital truly belongs to the people."

    驻吉林省人民医院工人毛泽东思想宣传队发动医护人员
    狠抓革命大批判改革不合理的医疗制度
    他们边批边改，以批带改，医护人员觉悟不断提高，医院面貌焕然一新。广大群众赞扬说：人民医院这回可真正属于人民了。
    本报讯　驻吉林省人民医院工人毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助革委会以彻底革命的精神领导医院的斗、批、改，带领群众以毛主席的最新指示为武器，开展革命大批判，边批边改，以批带改，大破资产阶级的医疗制度，大立为广大劳动人民服务的医疗制度，使这个医院的面貌焕然一新。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，这个医院的党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级“权威”长期把持着大权，顽固地推行修正主义的医疗卫生路线，制定种种规章制度，对患病求治的工人、贫下中农百般刁难。在修正主义医疗卫生路线的影响下，不少医护人员也养成了“认病不认人”，“认制度不认阶级”的资产阶级旧作风。工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进医院以后，对这种状况十分气愤，他们决心用工人阶级的面貌彻底改造医院，让人民医院真正为广大劳动人民服务。
    怎样用工人阶级的面貌彻底改造医院，搞好医院的斗、批、改？工人宣传队和院革委会成员一起反复学习毛主席关于“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地”的教导，认识到：医院的党内一小撮走资派虽然被打倒了，但是为他们服务的旧的规章制度却依然存在，广大医护人员头脑中的旧思想、旧作风还没有彻底改变，为什么人服务的问题仍然没有得到解决。因此，解决这个问题就成为顺利地推动医院的斗、批、改的关键。
    工人宣传队抓住这个问题，发动全院革命职工运用各种形式开展了对修正主义医疗卫生路线的大批判。这个医院过去为党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级老爷大开方便之门，专门为他们开设“高级病房”、“特别门诊”、“特药柜橱”；而劳动人民住院治病，却住在一个由旧仓库改成的窗不挡风、房不经雨的所谓“简易病房”。在大批判中，工人宣传队组织全院医护人员参观、对比，并在现场举行了批判大会。在批判大会上，又把对党内一个走资派和一个贫农老大爷的治疗护理情况作了对比：一个是住在“高级病房”里，长期小病大养，挥霍了近千元的各种高级药品；一个是在“简易病房”里住了一个月，因交不出医疗费被推出医院。这些活生生的事实深深地教育了广大医护人员，使他们深刻认识到，为什么人看病的问题不是一般问题，而是两个阶级和两条路线斗争在医院的反映。特别是出身于贫下中农家庭的同志感受更深。他们说：医院现行的一套规章制度是推行修正主义路线的结果，是“卡”劳动人民的，长期以来，我们不自觉地执行了，这次一定要彻底砸烂这条修正主义的医疗路线，全心全意为人民服务。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队在提高医护人员两条路线斗争觉悟的基础上，又抓住“为谁服务”这个问题，组织大家学习毛主席的一个教导，对照大叛徒刘少奇的一条反动谬论，控诉本院走资派的一桩罪行，肃清修正主义一个方面的流毒，落实一条整改的措施。这样，越批越深，越批改得越快越彻底。做到批一个，破一个，立一个。过去，工人、贫下中农来医院看病，要经过挂号、诊断、处方划价、交款、取药五道关，排五次队。特别是挂号关，医院门外只有两个很小的窗口，不管隆冬盛夏，每天都有两千多人在这里排队挂号，经常要等很长的时间。工人宣传队就组织贫下中农患者和医护人员在挂号室门前开批判大会。一个从百里以外赶来看病的贫农老大爷愤怒地说：“这关那卡，关的都是工人阶级，卡的都是咱贫下中农。工贼刘少奇和他在各地的代理人，就是想在看病上专我们贫下中农的政。”通过现场大批判，医护人员改革不合理的规章制度的决心更大了。外科首先提出了取消挂号室的建议和措施。这一革命行动立即得到宣传队的全力支持，得到广大工人、贫下中农的赞扬。但也有少数人怕乱了秩序，主张后期再改。工人宣传队斩钉截铁地说：“我们工人阶级掌握了医疗大权，就要完全彻底地为人民服务，绝不能再让反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线延续一分一秒。”外科医护人员在宣传队的帮助下，大胆革新，取消了挂号室，让病人直接到外科诊室看病。工人宣传队还和医护人员亲临前线，宣传毛主席关于卫生工作的指示，批判不合理的旧规章制度，宣传卫生常识，把候诊室、门诊室办成学习毛泽东思想的阵地，变成大批判的战场，结果不但秩序不乱，而且教育了患者，受到工人和贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    外科取消挂号室后，带动了其它科对各种不合理的旧规章制度的一系列改革。各科也简化了手续，把挂号下放到各科诊室。一般常用药，只交医生看过后把药交给患者，由护士兼管收费就行了。急诊病人和需要立病案的患者，由医生证明直接转到急重病处置室，先看病后办手续。这样挂号、诊断等五道手续一次就完成了，大大方便了病人，病人就医时间一般不超过一个小时。
    各种不合理的旧规章制度打破以后，工人宣传队发现医生的担子重了，护士的担子相对轻了。本来一个有十几年实践经验的老护士可以处置一般疾病和一般手术，可是过去资产阶级反动学术“权威”却只让护士打零杂，为医生服务。这时，工人宣传队就发动医护人员大批刘少奇“专家治院”的反革命谬论，大摆院内走资派封“权威”、立“名医”，分级划等，歧视医护人员的罪行，使医护人员认识到：过去党内走资派搞分等划级就是为他们自己培养资产阶级的接班人。五官科护士王觉同志说：“我们为人民服务的目标是一致的，绝没有高低贵贱之分，修正主义路线企图用分级划等把我们分开。我们一定要彻底摧毁反革命修正主义路线，我们一定要在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下贴得更紧。”通过大批判，医护人员的关系大大密切了，医生能做护理工作，不少有经验的护士也可以诊治病人，大大提高了工作效率。内科过去一天有八百人排队挂号，只能看二百人左右。现在，一个上午就可以看五百多病人。改革以后的人民医院，受到广大劳动人民的欢迎和赞扬，他们高兴地说：“人民医院这回可真正属于人民了。”　石流　井长红（附图片）
    在这场伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，渭北煤矿反帝矿医务所在驻所工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，建立了“医护合一”的制度，使本单位的斗、批、改迈出了可喜的一步。这是医务所的医护人员在一起交流诊断意见，共同提高，以便更好地为人民服务。　新华社记者摄
