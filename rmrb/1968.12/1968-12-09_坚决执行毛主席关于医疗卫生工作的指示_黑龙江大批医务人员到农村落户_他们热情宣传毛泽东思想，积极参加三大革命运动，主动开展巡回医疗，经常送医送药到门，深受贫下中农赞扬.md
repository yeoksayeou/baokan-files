A large number of medical personnel in Heilongjiang have moved to rural areas to settle down. They enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements, and proactively carry out mobile medical services, often bringing medical care and medicine to the doorstep, and are deeply praised by poor and lower-middle peasants.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 7th: The broad medical and health personnel in Heilongjiang Province have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," sparking a wave of going down to the countryside and up to the mountains. The province has already sent 3,600 medical and health personnel to settle in rural areas. Including recent graduates from large and medium-sized medical colleges and traditional Chinese medicine apprentices who have completed their training, a total of 8,400 medical and health personnel have settled in rural areas, thus strengthening the medical forces in rural areas.

The revolutionary committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province attach great importance to the work of medical and health personnel going down to the countryside and up to the mountains. They universally organize medical and health personnel to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's instructions on medical and health work. In the study classes, the broad medical and health personnel use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. They combine their own practices and experiences of going down to the countryside for mobile medical services over the past two years, deeply realizing that Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas" is extremely wise and correct, greatly enhancing their determination to go down to the countryside and settle down. Many medical units' revolutionary committee members take the lead in settling down in rural areas. Forty-two members of the revolutionary committees of five hospitals, including the Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Hospital and the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital in Mudanjiang, have already taken the initiative to go down to the countryside.

After arriving in rural areas, the broad medical and health personnel actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements in rural areas. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, their clear class stance in the struggle against enemies, and their hardworking and thrifty qualities have deeply educated the medical and health personnel who have gone down to the countryside. They say: "After coming to the countryside, our faces have tanned, and our thoughts have started to turn red. Our determination to thoroughly change our worldview has also grown stronger." Many medical and health personnel are not afraid of high mountains and long roads, regardless of day or night, wind or rain, and proactively go to remote production teams for mobile medical services. They also often go deep into the fields or to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought and bringing medical care and medicine to the doorstep. The medical personnel from the First Hospital in Qiqihar who have settled down in the Shanjian Commune of Longjiang County have, in just over fifty days since arriving in the countryside, overcome numerous difficulties in extremely primitive medical conditions, performed more than fifty surgeries including ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cysts, appendicitis, and hernia, and treated more than 7,000 people. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Chairman Mao thought of everything so thoroughly. Not only did he help us stand up politically, but he also cares about our health, setting up hospitals at our doorsteps and sending doctors to treat us. Truly, the greatest blessing is Chairman Mao's care!"

    坚决执行毛主席关于医疗卫生工作的指示
    黑龙江大批医务人员到农村落户
    他们热情宣传毛泽东思想，积极参加三大革命运动，主动开展巡回医疗，经常送医送药到门，深受贫下中农赞扬
    新华社哈尔滨七日电　黑龙江省广大医疗卫生人员，认真落实毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，掀起了下乡上山热潮。全省已有三千六百多名医疗卫生人员到农村安家落户。连同最近两年从大中医学院校毕业的学生以及出师的中医学徒，已有八千四百多名医疗卫生人员到农村安家落户，从而加强了农村医疗力量。
    黑龙江省各级革命委员会对医疗卫生人员上山下乡工作极为重视，普遍组织医疗卫生人员举办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于医疗卫生工作的指示。在学习班里，广大医疗卫生人员以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线。他们结合自己这两年下乡巡回医疗的实践和体会，深深认识到毛主席关于“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示，无比英明正确，大大增强了他们上山下乡安家落户的决心，纷纷申请到农村去。许多医疗单位的革委会成员带头到农村安家落户。牡丹江市工农兵医院、结核病防治院等五个医院四十二名革委会成员，已有十九名同志积极带头下乡。
    广大医疗卫生人员到农村后，积极参加农村的三大革命运动。广大贫下中农无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，在对敌斗争中鲜明的阶级立场，艰苦朴素的品质，使下乡的医疗卫生人员深受教育。他们说：
  “到了农村，脸晒黑了，思想开始变红了，对彻底改造世界观的决心也大了。”许多医疗卫生人员不怕山高路远，不管白天黑夜，刮风下雨，主动到边远生产队巡回医疗，还经常地深入到田间地头或贫下中农家里，热情宣传毛泽东思想，送医药到门。齐齐哈尔市第一医院到龙江县山泉公社安家落户的医务人员，在到农村后短短的五十多天中，在医疗设备极端简陋的情况下，克服了重重困难，做了子宫外孕、卵巢囊肿、阑尾炎、疝气等五十多例手术，为七千多人看了病。贫下中农说：“毛主席他老人家想的真周到，不仅使咱们在政治上翻了身，还关心咱们的健康，把医院设在家门口，派医生给咱们治病，真是天大地大不如毛主席恩情大！”
