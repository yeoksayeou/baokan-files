The first batch of students from Tianjin Yanan Middle School has been in the Keerqin Grassland of Tongliao County, Chifeng League, Inner Mongolia, for nearly half a year. We have long wanted to understand how the young revolutionaries are growing in the countryside. Recently, we visited them with the military training personnel from Yanan Middle School.

The train was rushing through the boundless eastern Mongolian plain. Our minds often recalled the process in which the revolutionary youngsters of Yanan Middle School grew under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant "March 7" directive. At the same time, we also remembered the moving scene of them resolutely taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao half a year ago.

Upon arriving at Yuxin Commune, the commune and brigade cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants told us, "The revolutionary youngsters from Yanan Middle School really have the 'Yanan spirit.'" From their mouths, we learned that after arriving at Yuxin Commune, the revolutionary youngsters of Yanan Middle School studied and applied Chairman Mao's thoughts together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They humbly accepted the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants and made significant progress.

However, when these youngsters met us, they did not mention their achievements at all. One youngster eagerly asked us, "What do you mean by 'great achievements'?" This sudden question caught us off guard. The great leader Chairman Mao said, "The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." We had memorized this sentence long ago, but how should we answer them? Following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes," we discussed this question of universal significance with the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary youngsters.

Changing Thoughts and Emotions

In early autumn, the hemp-soaking pits were covered with green foam, and the rotting hemp gave off a foul odor. When it came time to pull the hemp, some students hesitated by the pit, wondering whether to go in or not. At this moment, Wang Xin Hong, a 69-year-old poor peasant and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from Yuxin Commune, came to the pit. Without saying a word, she stepped into the foul-smelling water and began pulling the hemp bundle by bundle. This incident deeply educated the revolutionary youngsters. They said, "Compared to the poor and lower-middle peasants, we lack the proletarian feelings of not fearing dirt, not fearing hardship, and being selfless." The students brought the problems exposed during labor to study Chairman Mao's works and severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line advocated by Liu Shaoqi. Through study and criticism, everyone's thoughts and emotions began to change. When they followed the commune members into the waist-deep foul-smelling water to pull hemp, they became more and more enthusiastic and energetic. After pulling the hemp, as soon as they changed out of their dirty clothes, the students rushed to wash them. When the toilet in the brigade needed to be cleaned, they picked up the manure buckets and cleaned it with the commune members. Now, many students wear self-repaired work clothes and feel very comfortable. The change in thoughts and emotions brought the youngsters closer to the poor and lower-middle peasants. They carried water and swept the courtyard for Mu Grandma, an 80-year-old poor peasant and a five-guarantee household. The poor and lower-middle peasants affectionately said, "These little fellows are becoming more and more like us poor and lower-middle peasants. The young intellectuals educated by Chairman Mao are truly outstanding!"

When it came to the change in thoughts and emotions, everyone had a lot to share! When they first arrived at Yuxin Commune, many students did not know the difference between grains and weeds. Now they know when to sow sorghum, wheat, and corn, when to weed, when to fertilize, and when to harvest. When they first learned to weed, many people were so tired that they couldn't straighten their backs. They studied Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They finally persevered. When shelling corn and peeling sugar beets, many students' hands were blistered and cracked, but no one paid attention to it until their hands were calloused. "Now we know how hard it is to get grain!" This is the personal experience gained from labor by the youngsters. They said, "In the past, in big cities, we only knew how to buy grain from the grain store. Now we know that every grain is obtained by shedding sweat and toiling." In the past, when they were in school, they did not mind wasting a little grain. Now it's different. A sudden autumn rain came, and the corn on the threshing floor was in danger of sprouting. Everyone, although tired from a day's work, still stood up with the poor and lower-middle peasants to rush to the threshing floor and snatched the corn from the wind and rain. They said, "Seeing a pile of grain soaked with the sweat of the poor and lower-middle peasants and ourselves, we are truly happy from the bottom of our hearts. We feel that we are now able to contribute to the construction of socialism."

Everywhere they went, the youngsters often liked to show us their belongings: the pile of firewood in the courtyard, the big fat pig in the pen, the grain, oil, soy sauce, vinegar in the kitchen, the pickled vegetables in the jar, the big white cabbage and potatoes stored in the cellar. The students also happily told us that now almost everyone has learned to cook and stir-fry. They said, "In the city, we were all children who ate ready-made meals, but now we are starting to learn how to live and manage for the revolution."

Growing in Class Struggle

When the poor and lower-middle peasants welcomed the revolutionary youngsters to settle down with gongs and drums, a small group of class enemies were secretly spreading rumors, stirring up trouble, and causing mischief. The revolutionary youngsters of Yanan Middle School, who had been tempered in the storm of the Cultural Revolution for two years, raised their awareness of the line struggle through the re-education of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Under the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they launched a proactive attack on the class enemies. They exposed and struggled against the landlords and rich peasants who had not been reformed, the bad elements who sabotaged the autumn harvest, one by one, and thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the class enemies and boosted the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The youngsters told us that now, when they reread Chairman Mao's article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," they feel more and more familiar with it because they can apply what they learn immediately. One day, a cadre who had been removed during the Four Cleanups in Xinli Duan Brigade of Yuxin Commune sent his daughter to deliver six boiled corns to six female students. Why did he send us boiled corns? The more than twenty Yanan Middle School revolutionary youngsters who settled in this brigade reported to the production team and conducted a serious study. They quickly exposed this guy's trick. It turned out that this cadre who had been removed during the Four Cleanups was a class alien who had made a "double insurance" deal with the landlord class. Seeing that the revolutionary youngsters were making rapid progress under the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, he wanted to play tricks and win over these youngsters. The youngsters said, "These are not six corns, but six sugar-coated bullets fired by the class enemy." Therefore, they held up the Red Book, lined up in an orderly queue, and went to the door of that villain, reading Chairman Mao's instruction: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." They exposed his plot. In the face of the youngsters' resolute struggle, this villain finally lowered his head. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw that the youngsters were making rapid progress in the struggle and were very happy.

At this point, we asked the youngsters, "What do you mean by 'great achievements'?" They said with deep feelings, "What is achievement? Achievement is to serve the people! It is to read Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. It is to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, humbly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, strive to reform one's worldview, devote all one's energy to the cause of serving the people, and do revolution in the countryside for a lifetime, building a new socialist countryside with the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Looking at these vigorous revolutionary youths, we deeply felt that they were like young saplings, growing vigorously in the vast world of the countryside under the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought.

    他们在广阔的天地里成长
    ——访天津延安中学在内蒙古插队落户的知识青年
    天津延安中学第一批知识青年，在内蒙古科尔沁草原哲里木盟通辽县育新公社插队落户已将近半年了。我们很早就想了解一下，小将们在农村成长得怎么样？最近，我们和延安中学的军训人员走访了他们。
    列车在一望无际的东蒙平原上奔驰着，我们的脑海中不时回顾着，延安中学的革命小将在伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“三·七”批示的指引下成长的过程，同时也想起了他们半年前坚定地走上毛主席所指引的知识青年同工农相结合的道路的动人场面。
    一到育新公社，社、队干部和贫下中农就对我们说：“延安中学来的这伙革命小将真有点‘延安’劲。”从他们的口中，我们了解到，延安中学的革命小将来到育新公社后，和贫下中农一起活学活用毛泽东思想，虚心地接受贫下中农的再教育，有了很大进步。
    可是，这伙小青年和我们见面后却压根不谈自己的成绩。有一个小青年急切地问我们：“你们说，什么叫大有作为？”这个突然的袭击，把我们给问愣了。伟大领袖毛主席说：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”这句话我们早就背熟了，但是，究竟应该怎么答复他们呢？我们遵照毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，同贫下中农、革命干部和革命小将一起，探讨了这个带有普遍意义的问题。
    思想感情变了
    初秋，沤麻坑上泛起绿色的泡沫，沤烂的麻发出一股臭味，捞麻的时候，有的同学在坑边犹豫起来了，下去还是不下去呢？这时，育新公社学习毛主席著作积极分子、六十九岁的贫农老大娘王心红来到坑边。她二话没说，就踏进臭水坑里去，把麻一捆一捆地捞起来。这件事深深地教育了革命小将，他们说：“和贫下中农比起来，我们缺乏不怕脏、不怕累、一心为公的无产阶级感情。”同学们带着劳动中暴露出来的问题，学习毛主席著作，狠批刘少奇所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线。通过学习和批判，大家的思想感情开始变了，再跟着社员到齐腰深的臭水里去捞麻，大家就越干越高兴，越干越有劲。捞麻回来，刚把脏衣服换下来，同学们又互相马上抢着去洗……。队里的厕所该掏了，他们就背起粪桶，跟社员一起去掏。现在许多同学身上穿着自己缝补的劳动装，心里感到很舒畅。思想感情的转变使小将们和贫下中农的感情接近了，他们给八十多岁的贫农、五保户穆大娘挑水、扫院子。贫下中农亲切地说：这些小疙瘩和咱们贫下中农越来越亲了，毛主席他老人家教育出来的知识青年真有出息呀！
    谈到思想感情的转变，大家的体会可多啦！刚到育新公社的时候，不少同学五谷不分，常把谷苗看成野草。现在他们已经知道高粱、谷子、玉米什么时候播种，什么时候耪地，什么时候施肥，什么时候收割了。刚学锄草时，许多人累得直不起腰来，他们就一遍又一遍地学习毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”终于坚持了下来，掰包米和削甜菜时，许多同学的手上磨起了血泡，裂了大口子，可是谁也没把它放在心上，直到手上结起了老茧。“现在才知道粮食来之不易啊！”这是小将们从劳动中获得的切身体会。他们说：“过去在大城市，只知道上粮店去买粮食，现在才知道每一粒粮都是汗珠掉地摔八瓣儿换来的。”过去上学时，浪费一点粮不心疼。现在可不一样了，一场秋雨袭来，场上的玉米有发芽的危险，大家虽然累了一天，也照样精神抖擞地和贫下中农一起抢场，硬是把玉米从风雨中夺回来了。大家说：“看到一堆堆浇过贫下中农和自己汗水的粮食，真是打心眼里感到高兴。觉得现在能为社会主义建设添砖增瓦了。”
    每到一处，小将们常常爱让我们看他们的家当：院子里的柴草堆，圈里的大肥猪，伙房里的粮、油、酱、醋，缸里腌的咸菜，窖里存的大白菜、土豆。同学们还高兴地告诉我们，现在差不多人人都学会做饭炒菜了。大家说：在城市里，我们都是吃现成饭的孩子，可现在，开始学着过日子，学着为革命“管家”了。
    在阶级斗争中成长
    在贫下中农敲锣打鼓欢迎革命小将插队落户的时候，一小撮阶级敌人却在背地里煽阴风，点邪火，搬弄是非。在文化大革命的暴风雨中经受过两年锻炼的延安中学革命小将，经过广大贫下中农的再教育，提高了路线斗争觉悟，在贫下中农的带领下，向阶级敌人展开了主动进攻。把没有改造好的地富分子，破坏秋收的坏分子，一个一个揪出来批斗，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，大长了贫下中农的志气。
    小将们告诉我们，现在重温毛主席《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇文章，感到越读越亲切，因为学了马上就能用上。有一天，育新公社新立屯大队一个四清下台干部派他的女儿给六个女同学送来了六个黄橙橙、香喷喷的煮玉米。他为什么给我们送煮玉米？在这个队落户的二十多名延安中学的革命小将一面向生产队作了汇报，一面进行了认真的研究，很快就揭穿了这个家伙的鬼把戏。原来，这个四清下台干部是个和地主分子订立过“双保险”的阶级异己分子，他看到革命小将在贫下中农的教育下进步很快，就想耍手腕，把这伙小青年拉过去。小将们说：这不是六个玉米，是阶级敌人射来的六发糖衣炮弹。于是，他们手擎着红色宝书，排起整齐的队伍，找上那个坏蛋的家门，宣读了毛主席的指示：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”揭露了他的阴谋。在小将们针锋相对的斗争面前，这个坏家伙终于低下了头。贫下中农看到小将们在斗争中进步很快，都很高兴。
    谈到这里，我们问小将们，你们说什么叫大有作为？他们深有体会地回答说：“什么是作为？作为就是为人民服务！就是要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚决照毛主席的指示办事，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，虚心接受贫下中农的再教育，努力改造自己的世界观，把自己的全部精力投入到为人民服务的事业中去，在农村干一辈子革命，和贫下中农一起建设社会主义的新农村。”
    看着一个个朝气蓬勃的革命青年，我们深深地感到，他们就象一棵棵的幼苗，在毛泽东思想灿烂阳光的照耀下，在农村这个广阔的天地里茁壮地成长了。
