The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the rural areas of Shaanxi Province are conscientiously implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" and have launched a winter agricultural land construction drive.

This year, the most distinctive feature of agricultural land construction in Shaanxi Province is that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres have voluntarily placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, emphasizing proletarian politics, and using revolution to lead production. Throughout the province, agricultural land construction sites have set up tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, turning the sites into large-scale schools for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Aiguo People's Commune in Chenggu County, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes at every construction site. They read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Everyone's revolutionary spirit is surging, and everyone's work enthusiasm is doubled. With the cooperation of brother communes and production teams, they have already completed a 25-li-long irrigation canal and have newly built 4,400 mu of terraced fields, increasing the watered field area to 73% of the total cultivated land, fundamentally changing the dry conditions.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres fighting on the agricultural land construction sites in Shaanxi Province, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," are deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "self-reliance, self-management, self-sufficiency," "four freedoms," "work points as the commander," and "material incentives" on the agricultural front. They have eliminated their poisonous influence and powerfully promoted agricultural land construction work.

    陕西农村深入开展革命大批判
    有力地推动冬季农田基本建设
    据新华社西安四日电  陕西省农村的广大贫下中农和基层干部，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，掀起了冬季农田基本建设的热潮。
    今年，陕西省农田基本建设的最大特点是，广大贫下中农和基层干部，自觉地把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，突出无产阶级政治，以革命统帅生产。全省各地农田基本建设工地办起了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，把工地变成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。城固县爱国公社的贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，在每一个工地上都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，人人革命精神焕发，个个劳动干劲倍增，在兄弟社、队的协作下，目前已经修成一条长达二十五华里的引水渠，新修水平梯田四千四百多亩，使全公社水田面积发展到占总耕地面积的百分之七十三，基本上改变了干旱面貌。
    战斗在陕西农田基本建设工地上的贫下中农和基层干部，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的伟大教导，深入开展革命大批判。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人在农业战线上推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，肃清其流毒，有力地推动了农田基本建设工作。
