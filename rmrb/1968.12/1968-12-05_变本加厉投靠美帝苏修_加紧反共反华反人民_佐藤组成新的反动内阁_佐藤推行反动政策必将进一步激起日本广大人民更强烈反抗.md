	Escalating Betrayal: Sato Forms New Reactionary Cabinet, Intensifying Anti-Communist, Anti-Chinese, and Anti-People Policies

	Sato's Reactionary Policies Will Further Incite Stronger Resistance from the Japanese People

	BEIJING, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) - Tokyo: The tool of the Japanese monopoly bourgeoisie, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan, led by Sato Eisaku, formed a new reactionary cabinet on November 30. Sato's cabinet formation indicates that, in the face of the surging revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people, the Japanese reactionaries will intensify their struggles and escalate their betrayal, further implementing counter-revolutionary policies of aligning with U.S. imperialism, colluding with Soviet revisionism, and opposing communism, China, and the people.

	Prior to this, the LDP held its biennial "election" for the party president on November 27, a farce that saw Sato Eisaku, with strong backing from U.S. imperialism and Japanese pro-American monopolies, "elected" for the third time as the LDP president. Immediately after his "reelection," Sato "adjusted" the major figures within the LDP and formed a new cabinet. Through this "adjustment," the ultra-pro-American Sato faction and the Fukuda Takeo faction further consolidated control over the cabinet and the LDP.

	The LDP's presidential "election" and the formation of the new cabinet took place at a time when the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people was thriving, and the student movement against the decadent bourgeois education system was gaining momentum. In this context, U.S. imperialism and Japanese pro-American monopolies once again brought forward Sato, who has consistently pursued pro-American, pro-Soviet, anti-Chinese, anti-communist, and anti-people policies, attempting to form a more reactionary cabinet to extricate themselves from the numerous difficulties and serious crises they face. This fully exposes the ferocious nature and weak essence of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

	In his "Ten-Point Policy" and statements to the press, Sato bared his fangs, raving madly about his intention to continue following the U.S., adhering to the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," vigorously advocating the revival of Japanese militarism, and boasting about strengthening fascist rule domestically to more brutally suppress the anti-American patriotic struggles of the Japanese people and students.

	Sato's formation of the new cabinet and its reactionary policies will further incite even stronger resistance from the broad masses of the Japanese people, leading to even more disgraceful failures.

    变本加厉投靠美帝苏修　加紧反共反华反人民
    佐藤组成新的反动内阁
    佐藤推行反动政策必将进一步激起日本广大人民更强烈反抗
    新华社三日讯　东京消息：日本垄断资产阶级的工具日本执政党自由民主党总裁佐藤荣作，十一月三十日组成新的反动内阁。佐藤这次组阁表明，在日本人民革命斗争蓬勃高涨的形势下，日本反动派将加紧进行挣扎，变本加厉地推行投靠美帝，勾结苏修，反华、反共、反人民的反革命政策。
    在这以前，自由民主党于十一月二十七日演出了两年一度的“选举”自由民主党总裁的丑剧。佐藤荣作在美帝国主义和日本亲美垄断资本的大力支持下，第三次“当选”为自由民主党总裁。佐藤荣作再次“当选”后，立即“调整”了自由民主党的主要头目并组成了新内阁。经过这次“调整”，自由民主党内极端亲美的佐藤派和福田赳夫派进一步控制了内阁和自由民主党。
    这次日本自由民主党的总裁“选举”和新内阁组成，是在日本人民的反美爱国斗争蓬勃发展，日本学生反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的斗争方兴未艾，美日反动派日子越来越不好过的时候进行的。在这种情况下，美帝国主义和日本亲美垄断资本再一次把一贯顽固地推行亲美、联苏、反华、反共、反人民的政策的佐藤抬出来，企图通过佐藤组成一个更加反动的内阁来摆脱它们面临的重重困难和严重危机，这充分暴露了美日反动派的凶恶面目和虚弱本质。
    佐藤在他提出的“十大政纲”中以及对记者发表的谈话中，凶相毕露，疯狂地叫嚷他要继续追随美帝，坚持日美“安全条约”，大肆鼓吹进一步复活日本军国主义，并且叫嚣要在国内加强法西斯统治，更加野蛮地镇压日本人民和青年学生的反美爱国斗争。
    佐藤组织新内阁和它推行的反动政策，必将进一步激起日本广大人民更加强烈的反抗，遭到更加可耻的失败。
