Recently, workers from a certain team in the first workshop of the Shenyang Smelting Plant were busy conducting a technical innovation experiment.

One day, veteran worker Wang Shifu and a few other workers found a two-meter-long old steel pipe, intending to use it for the experiment. However, they realized they were still short by one meter. What to do? Someone suggested, “Today, we are in charge. We are conducting technical innovation, so let’s just tell the Revolutionary Committee and get a new one from the warehouse.”

As soon as someone mentioned using a new steel pipe, the workers started discussing. Some said, “We should utilize waste materials. We need to promote frugality and revolution, and not lose the essence of the working class.” At this point, Wang Shifu held up a red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and read aloud, “To make our country prosperous and strong, we need to strive for several decades of hard work, including implementing the policy of thrift and opposing waste in building our country.” He then spoke earnestly, “In the past, the bourgeois technical ‘authorities’ conducted experiments with the mindset of ‘seeking the big and foreign’ and ‘seeking fame and profit,’ squandering national funds at will. Today, we are in charge. When it’s our turn to conduct experiments, we must strive for strength, be self-reliant, work hard, and have a sense of responsibility as masters of the country to save every inch of steel, every cent, and every unit of electricity. If we do not value frugality, and let the bourgeois way of thinking corrupt our minds, our power will change color. Frugality and revolution is a concrete expression of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and it is the family treasure of the working class. We must not lose it!” Wang Shifu’s words deeply educated everyone. They all said, “The steel pipe is short, but we will go to the scrap pile to find more. We will search the entire factory if necessary, and weld a few sections together, but we will definitely not use a new one.”

So, everyone used their rest time to search the scrap pile for steel pipes. However, after searching, they only found a half-meter-long usable piece. They were still short by half a meter. Should they continue to search for that half meter of steel pipe? The workers said, “The working class has a thorough revolutionary spirit, and in promoting frugality and revolution, we must also be models of thorough revolution.” They made up their minds to continue searching, and after searching every corner of the entire factory, they finally found another piece of steel pipe in the scrap pile of the copper smelting workshop.

A steel pipe for the experiment was welded together. The entire team of workers thus promoted frugality and revolution, and successfully completed a major technical innovation project that surpassed the world's advanced level.

专栏：节约闹革命的小故事

    掌权不丢传家宝
    前些日子，沈阳冶炼厂一车间某小组的工人正在忙着搞技术革新试验。
    一天，老工人宫师傅和几个工人找来一根二米长的旧钢管，准备搞试验时用。可是一算计，还差一米。怎么办呢？有人说：“今天咱们掌权了，又是搞技术革新，和革委会说一声，到库里领一根新的算了。”
    一提到用新钢管，工人们就议论开了。有的说：“应该利用废物，要节约闹革命，不能丢了咱工人阶级的本色。”这时，宫师傅捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高声念了起来：“要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”接着，他语重心长地说：“过去，资产阶级技术‘权威’搞试验是‘求大图洋’，‘求名逐利’，对国家资金任意挥霍。今天，我们掌权了，轮到自己搞试验，就要奋发图强，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，以主人翁的政治责任感为国家节约一寸钢、一厘钱、一度电。要是不重视节约，让资产阶级的那一套腐蚀我们的思想，我们的政权就会变色。节约闹革命是忠于毛主席的具体表现，是咱工人阶级的传家宝，咱可不能丢啊！”宫师傅的一席话，使大家受到深刻教育。都说：钢管短，我们到废料堆再找，宁肯找遍全厂，焊上几节，也坚决不用新的。
    于是，大家就利用休息时间到废料堆里找钢管。可是，找来找去才找到了一截适用的半米长的钢管。还差半米，那半米钢管要不要继续找？工人们说：工人阶级具有彻底的革命精神，节约闹革命，也要做彻底革命的模范。他们下定决心，继续找下去，找遍了全厂的每个角落，终于在铜冶炼车间的废料堆里找到了另一截钢管。
    一根搞试验用的钢管焊成了。这个小组的全体工人就是这样节约闹革命，实现了一项超过世界先进水平的重大技术革新项目。
