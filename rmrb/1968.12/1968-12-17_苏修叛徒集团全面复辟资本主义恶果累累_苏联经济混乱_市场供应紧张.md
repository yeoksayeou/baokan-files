The traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists has fully restored capitalism in the Soviet Union, squandering the hard-won socialist achievements of the Soviet people after decades of bloodshed and struggle. Currently, as the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists intensifies the implementation of their so-called "new economic system," the entire Soviet economy has fallen into further chaos. The supply of daily necessities in the market is extremely tight, prices are rising continuously, and the lives of the broad masses of laboring people are becoming increasingly difficult.

Agricultural production is disrupted, and food supplies are severely inadequate

In recent years, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have repeatedly boasted about the "harvests" in Soviet agriculture. However, this lie cannot cover up the fact that agricultural products are in short supply in both urban and rural markets in the Soviet Union. By examining the bits and pieces of market tension revealed in Soviet revisionist publications, one can easily see that the so-called "harvests" are nothing but a fairy tale concocted by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk to deceive public opinion and maintain the shaky reactionary rule of the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists.

Bread is the staple food of the Soviet people, yet for many years, except in a few large cities, the variety of bread sold in various parts of the Soviet Union has been extremely limited. Last October, the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists, in an attempt to quell public dissatisfaction with the inadequate supply of bread, issued a blank check, promising to "significantly increase" the variety of bread sold by 1968. Over the past year, the supply of bread has not only failed to "significantly increase," but has instead become even tighter. Even Brezhnev had to admit that the supply of bread has decreased by six percent. In many places, only one type of black bread is available. The Soviet Trade News reported that in the Amur region of Siberia, "for example, today there might be sweet bread, but tomorrow there won't be any. Small buns are rare."

The situation is even worse for other food items such as vegetables and meat. The traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists has gone to great lengths to present Moscow as their so-called "showcase" of "socialism." However, even in Moscow, the supply of various food items in the market is quite pitiful. In the "state-run" markets here, one can often only see a few vegetable stalls, with long lines of people waiting, and it is difficult to buy fresh meat and vegetables. In the "free markets," there are some fresh vegetables and meat, but the prices are exorbitantly high. Except for those in the high-income bracket, the general laboring people with low incomes simply cannot afford them. The recent meeting of "party activists" held by the Moscow City Committee of the Soviet revisionists revealed that in Moscow, there is a shortage of meat, dairy products, and vegetables.

The Soviet Economic News acknowledged that the actual yield of vegetables in the Soviet Union last year was 21 percent less than the required amount. Adding to this the losses incurred during harvesting, transportation, and storage, the supply of vegetables is extremely difficult and far from meeting the demand. Even in the relatively warm and less densely populated Tajik Republic, due to the failure of the "state farms" to fulfill their vegetable supply tasks, vegetables are often in short supply. The residents in the northern regions of the Soviet Union can hardly eat fresh vegetables throughout the year and almost always eat dried potatoes. In the Soviet Union, due to the disruption of agricultural and pastoral production, the supply of meat has been tight for several years. Except for a few large cities, in various parts of the Soviet Union, including the capitals of some autonomous republics, in the largest food stores, people can hardly see any poultry meat. As for pork, there is even less. Brezhnev, the head of the Soviet revisionists, recently had to admit, "Unfortunately, the total number of pigs has decreased."

At the same time, in various parts of the Soviet Union, especially in cities, the supply of fruits is extremely scarce, and it is very difficult to buy fruits in the market. The traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists only displays some apples in some fruit stores or in the dining rooms of hotels when foreign guests arrive to dress up the appearance.

The supply of daily necessities is tight, and the quality of products is extremely poor

In recent years, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have repeatedly made promises to the Soviet people to "rapidly develop" the production of daily necessities. However, no matter how sweet their promises sound, today, the phenomenon of tight supply of daily necessities in the Soviet market can be felt almost everywhere.

In the Soviet market, textiles, footwear, knitwear, children's clothing, and work clothes are all in short supply. According to a recent report in the Soviet Economic News, in the department stores of Khabarovsk, "for every ten customers, only one pair of gloves can be bought, and women's hats are not even worth mentioning."

The Soviet newspapers also revealed that in some places, even matches are often unavailable. In many places, "to buy a pencil, one sometimes has to go through almost ten stores."

The November 20 issue of Pravda reported that in Krasnodar, a city with a population of 420,000, "you (go to the store) to find ordinary plates, cups, and trays for the cafeteria is in vain." In this city, even glass cups are hard to come by. The Soviet Minister of Commerce admitted, "Similar difficulties can be felt in many cities and states." If these daily necessities are already in such short supply, the situation of other daily necessities can be imagined.

Due to the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists' increasingly severe implementation of the "new system" centered on capitalist profit principles, in the Soviet daily necessities industry, enterprises pursue profits, focus on the quantity of products, and ignore quality. Coupled with management issues, the quality of many daily necessities supplied to the market is also very poor, even becoming waste products. According to reports in Soviet newspapers, in Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, a commercial company selling shoes found nearly 600,000 pairs of shoes that were all waste products. The reason was that due to the shortage of shoes, local shoe factories took advantage of the situation to speculate, cut corners in production, and produce shoddy goods. It was reported that a combined factory producing synthetic fiber fabrics had a shrinkage rate of as high as 10 percent. The Soviet Economic News had to admit, "Clothing made from this fabric is unwearable."

Due to the shortage and poor quality of domestically produced goods, the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists attempted to supplement the market supply with a large number of imported goods and used the method of selling imported goods at high prices to recover some currency. Czech coats, British sweaters, Italian leather shoes flooded the Soviet market. However, these goods are priced exorbitantly, and the broad masses of laboring people naturally dare not touch them.

Market prices are rising continuously, and the lives of laboring people are becoming increasingly difficult

According to the regulations of the Soviet revisionist authorities, many enterprises implementing the "new system" have had the right to raise the wholesale prices of their products since July 1, 1967. The bourgeois privileged elements who control these enterprises took this opportunity to speculate wildly. With the increase in wholesale prices, the retail prices of some commodities in the market have also been raised in various forms and for various reasons. The broad masses of people have suffered new blows as a result.

The Soviet Economic News revealed, "A check of 34 sewing factories in some states of the Russian Federation determined that the average retail prices of products have been raised," such as the price of men's wool suits produced by the Piatigorsk factory has increased by more than 44 percent compared to 1965, and the price of children's pants has increased from 7 rubles 30 kopecks to 9 rubles 60 kopecks, an increase of more than 31 percent. In some places, a type of enlarger produced last year had its price arbitrarily raised by 20 percent just six months after it hit the market.

Under the stimulus of profits, the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists and the small privileged class in various local enterprises, following the capitalist "business principles," use every possible means to raise product prices and exploit the people. Even though it is the same product, they can change the appearance and packaging to raise the price. For example, the "Mountaineer" brand transistor radio, just by changing the shell, increased the price by about 60 percent. The "Flight" brand watch, just by changing the dial, also increased the price.

Industrial products are like this, and agricultural products are also like this. In a large city, milk suddenly increased in price, supposedly because of the addition of "vitamins." Customers sarcastically said, "There were no additional vitamins, maybe a little more water was added."

Prices are rising continuously, and the lives of the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly difficult. In the Soviet Union, a large part of ordinary laborers have a monthly income of only a few dozen rubles, and an ordinary technician earns only 60 to 70 rubles per month. While a kilogram of tomatoes costs 2 rubles, this means that a technician's monthly income is only enough to buy 30 kilograms of tomatoes, and for those with even lower wages, one can imagine how much they can buy with their monthly income.

The traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists' reckless actions are awakening the people

In the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held in Moscow, the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists pretended to boast about how the production of daily consumer goods in the Soviet Union has "increased," and how they have "achieved major successes" in "developing the economy" and "improving the welfare of the residents." They can blow their own horns, but the harsh reality of Soviet industrial and agricultural production and market supply shows that their propaganda is not worth much.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: A revolutionary party and revolutionary people must repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to be tempered and mature, and to have the guarantee of victory.

The traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists is a good negative example for the Soviet people. Their reckless actions are promoting the further awakening of the Soviet people. The broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union, through their own personal experiences, are increasingly recognizing the traitorous nature of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk. They will surely rise up and launch a fierce attack on these traitors and labor bosses.

    苏修叛徒集团全面复辟资本主义恶果累累
    苏联经济混乱　市场供应紧张
    据新华社十六日讯　本社记者报道：苏修叛徒集团在苏联全面实行资本主义复辟，把苏联人民几十年流血牺牲、艰苦奋斗取得的社会主义成果断送净尽。目前，在苏修叛徒集团加紧推行所谓“新经济体制”的情况下，整个苏联经济进一步陷入混乱，市场日用品供应十分紧张，物价不断上涨，广大劳动人民的生活越来越困难。
    农业生产遭到破坏食品供应严重不足
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流最近几年，一再大吹特吹苏联农业获得了“丰收”。但是，这种谎言掩盖不了苏联城乡市场农产品奇缺的事实。人们只要翻阅一下苏修报刊透露的市场紧张的点滴情况，就不难看出，所谓“丰收”云云，完全是勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为了欺骗舆论，维持苏修叛徒集团摇摇欲坠的反动统治，而编造出的《天方夜谭》式的神话而已。
    面包是苏联人民的主食，然而，多年来，除了某些大城市外，苏联各地出售的面包品种都非常少。去年十月，苏修叛徒集团为了平息人民对面包供应不足的不满，曾开出空头支票，说要在一九六八年使“各种面包的出售显著增加”。一年来，面包供应不仅没有“显著增加”，反而紧上加紧。连勃列日涅夫也不得不承认，面包供应量又减少了百分之六。在许多地方，现在只能买到一种黑面包。《苏维埃贸易报》透露，在西伯利亚的阿穆尔州，“商店里，比如说，今天有甜面包，明天就不会有了。小面包圈是罕见的。”
    主食品如此，各种副食品，如蔬菜、肉类等的供应情况就更糟了。苏修叛徒集团千方百计想把莫斯科装扮成他们的所谓“社会主义”的“橱窗”，然而，就是在莫斯科，市场上各种副食品的供应情况也十分可怜。在这里的“国营”市场上，往往只能看到寥寥无几的菜摊，旁边排着长队，而且很难买到新鲜的肉类、蔬菜。在“自由市场”上，倒是有一些鲜菜、鲜肉，但价格高得惊人，除了那些高薪阶层以外，一般收入低微的劳动人民根本买不起。苏修莫斯科市委不久前召开的“党员积极分子”会议上透露出来的消息承认，在莫斯科，肉类、奶类和蔬菜都供应不足。
    苏修《经济报》在谈到苏联蔬菜生产和供应情况时承认，苏联去年蔬菜实际收成比需要量少百分之二十一，再加上收获、运输和贮存中的损耗，蔬菜供应极困难，远远不能满足需要。连气候较暖、人口密度不大的塔吉克共和国，由于提供蔬菜的“国营农场”完不成任务，蔬菜也往往供应不上。而住在苏联北部地区的广大居民，一年到头根本吃不上新鲜蔬菜，几乎整年吃土豆干。在苏联，由于农牧业生产遭到破坏，最近一些年来，肉类的供应也一直是紧张的。除了少数大城市外，在苏联各地，包括一些加盟共和国的首都，在最大的食品店里，人们几乎看不到鸡鸭肉。至于猪肉就更少了。苏修头目勃列日涅夫最近也不得不承认，“遗憾的是，猪的总头数减少了”。
    与此同时，在苏联各地，特别是在城市，水果的供应非常缺乏，想在市场上买到水果是十分不容易的。苏修叛徒集团只是当有外国客人赶到时，才在一些地方的水果店或旅馆内部附设的餐厅里摆出一些苹果，装扮门面。
    生活用品供应紧张产品质量低劣不堪
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为了笼络人心，最近几年曾一再向苏联人民许下诺言，说是要“迅速发展”日用工业品的生产。可是，不管这些叛徒的诺言何等动听，在今天苏联市场上，日用工业品供应紧张的现象，人们几乎到处都能觉察到。
    在苏联市场上，纺织品、鞋类、针织品以及童装、工作服都非常缺货。据最近苏修《经济报》透露，在哈巴罗夫斯克的百货公司里，“手套每十个买主才能买到一副，而妇女戴的帽子连提都不要提了。”
    苏修报纸还透露，在有些地方，甚至连火柴都经常买不到。在许多地方“为了买一支铅笔，有时只好跑遍差不多十个商店”。
    十一月二十日的《真理报》说，在有四十二万人口的克拉斯诺达尔，“你（到商店）去找食堂用的普通碟子、茶杯、茶盘是徒劳的。”在这个城市里就连玻璃杯也难以买到。苏联商业部长供认，“类似的困难，在许多城市和许多州都能感觉到。”象这些日常生活必需品，已经缺乏到这种程度，其他日用工业品的供应情况就可想而知了。
    由于苏修叛徒集团变本加厉地推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的“新体制”，在苏联日用品工业企业中为了追求利润，只顾产品数量、不管质量，再加上管理上的问题，供应市场的许多日用工业品质量也是很差的，甚至是废品。据苏修报纸报道，在哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图，一家卖鞋的商业公司的仓库里发现有近六十万双鞋统统是废品。原因是由于鞋类供不应求，当地制鞋工厂乘机进行投机，生产中偷工减料，粗制滥造。据报道，有一家联合工厂生产的人造纤维衣料，缩水率竟达百分之十。苏修《经济报》也不得不承认，“用这种衣料做成的服装是不能穿的。”
    由于国产商品数量少、质量低，苏修叛徒集团企图以大量的外国进口货补充市场供应之不足，并以高价出售外国货的办法，回笼一些货币。什么捷克斯洛伐克的呢大衣，英国的毛衣，意大利的皮鞋，充斥苏联市场。然而，这些货物价格高昂，广大劳动人民群众当然是不敢问津的。
    市场物价不断上涨劳动人民生活困苦
    根据苏修当局的规定，苏修许多实行“新体制”的企业，从去年七月一日开始，有权提高产品的批发价格。把持了这些企业的资产阶级特权分子借此大肆投机。随着批发价格的提高，市场上一些商品的零售价格也以不同形式，以不同的借口提高了。广大人民群众却因此而遭到新的打击。
    苏修《经济报》透露，“对俄罗斯联邦一些州的三十四家缝纫工厂进行的检查确定，产品的平均零售价格在提高”，其中如，皮亚蒂戈尔斯克工厂生产的男毛料西服价格比一九六五年上涨了百分之四十四以上，童裤的价格从七卢布三十戈比涨到九卢布六十戈比，上涨了百分之三十一以上。在有的地方，去年出厂的一种放大机，上市半年之后，竟任意地把价格调高了百分之二十。
    在利润刺激下，苏修叛徒集团和各地企业一小撮特权阶层按着资产阶级的“生意经”，变尽法子提高产品价格，剥削人民。本来是同一种产品，他们改装一下，换换门面，就可以提高价格出售。例如，“登山运动员”牌半导体收音机，只是换了一个外壳，就把价格提高了百分之六十左右。“飞行”牌手表，只是换了个表盘，也提高了价格。
    工业品如此，农产品也如此。在一个大城市，牛奶突然涨了价，据说是因为什么增加了“维生素”。顾客们讽刺说，“根本没增加什么维生素，可能增加了一点点水。”
    物价不断上涨，苏联广大劳动人民的生活越来越困难。在苏联，有很大一部分普通劳动者每月的工资收入只有几十个卢布，一个普通技术员每月也只收入六、七十卢布。而一公斤西红柿要两个卢布，这就是说，一个技术员每月工资收入只够买三十公斤西红柿，至于那些工资更低的一般劳动者，每月工资能买到多少东西，就可以想象了。
    苏修叛徒倒行逆施促进人民日益觉醒
    苏修叛徒集团这几天在莫斯科举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议的讲坛上，装腔作势地吹嘘了一通，说什么苏联的日用消费品生产“增加了”，他们在“发展经济”和“提高居民福利方面”“取得了重大成绩”。牛皮尽可吹，而苏联工农业生产和市场供应的严酷现实说明，他们这些宣传是值不了几个钱的。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。
    苏修叛徒集团是苏联人民的一个很好的反面教员。它们的倒行逆施，正在促进苏联人民进一步觉醒。广大的苏联劳动人民通过自己的切身体会，日益认识到勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的叛徒面目。他们必将奋起斗争，向这些叛徒、工贼发动猛烈的进攻。
