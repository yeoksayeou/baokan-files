In the evening, the newly enlisted soldier Jin Xifu, who had just turned eighteen, sat in front of his father who had just come down from Changbai Mountain. As they studied together the copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that the unit had given him, Jin Xifu asked his father, "How is the study and application of Chairman Mao's works going at home? Has Grandma memorized the 'Three Articles'?"

Seeing his son's deep love for Chairman Mao, Jin Dad was overjoyed. He was about to praise him but then stopped, puzzled: "The boy keeps asking this and that, but why hasn't he asked about how the revolutionary criticism is going at home?"

The decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Simaoqi from the Party and revoke all his positions made Xiaojin ecstatic. His long-awaited wish had come true, and he felt especially relaxed. Revolutionary criticism had become a bit of a non-issue in his mind. However, Jin Dad, who had grown up in hardship, had experienced countless waves of class struggle and had learned many lessons from the class enemy's attempts to stage a comeback. Seeing his son reveal signs of complacency and overconfidence, Jin Dad spoke earnestly, "Xifu, although Simaoqi and his accomplices have been overthrown by us, they are still alive, their hearts are not dead, and their poison has not been completely eradicated. If we do not uproot the poisonous roots of revisionist thought, it will sprout and spread, poisoning the masses, and our power will be in danger!"

Hearing the word "power," Xiaojin immediately straightened up, attentively listening to his father's words. Jin Dad looked at his son, neatly dressed in his military uniform, glowing with health, and felt even more love and pride. Drinking water and remembering the source, today's happy life is all thanks to Chairman Mao. Therefore, educating his son to never forget his roots and to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and line struggle is his duty. He had Xiaojin recite Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly and repeatedly explained. It is not enough to explain it to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." As soon as Xiaojin finished reciting, Jin Dad affectionately said to his son, "Chairman Mao's words hit the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The historical experience of class struggle and the struggle between two lines must never be forgotten!"

Speaking of this, old grievances and new hatreds surged in his heart. He raised his voice in anger, "Simaoqi, this great traitor, spy, and scab, is truly rotten to the core! When we were fighting the Japanese devils, Simaoqi secretly helped Chiang Kai-shek, allowing the Japanese devils to run rampant on our soil, killing our Chinese people. Your second uncle was dragged to death because he resisted the devil's labor conscription!" Jin Dad's voice trembled. Xiaojin clenched his fists in anger, waiting for his father to continue. Jin Dad calmed down a bit and said indignantly, "I started working for the landlord at the age of eight, enduring hunger, cold, and hardship, living a life worse than cattle. What was the reason for this?" Xiaojin punched the air and firmly replied, "It's because we didn't have power!" "Right!" Jin Dad wiped his eyes and continued.

At this point, Xiaojin couldn't hold back any longer and angrily said, "Simaoqi, this rotten-hearted bastard, during the period of temporary difficulties in the national economy, jumped out again, spreading the black wind of 'three independences and one contract,' messing up our production team, and making us suffer so much!" Jin Dad, hearing his son express his innermost thoughts, immediately followed up, "All this is the trap set by Simaoqi." Hearing this, Xiaojin, deeply moved, loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Never forget class struggle." Jin Dad immediately continued, "Yes, we must always remember class struggle and always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat. Simaoqi is now like a frost-bitten cabbage, withered leaves and a rotten heart! We must never forget revolutionary criticism. We must criticize every day, every month, every year, and thoroughly criticize and expose Simaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts."

Jin Dad's words deeply educated Xiaoju. He reflected on his own complacency and overconfidence, promising to never forget the bitterness of class struggle, to remember the blood and tears, to continue to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, to constantly improve his awareness of class struggle and line struggle, to always be loyal to Chairman Mao, to always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and to always be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Jin Dad also expressed his determination to be a pioneer in the revolution and a model in production, following Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution.

    父子同忆无权苦，辈辈紧跟毛主席
    解放军某部　红旗山
    晚间，刚满十八岁的新战士金喜福，坐在刚从长白山下来到自己身边的父亲面前。他一边和父亲共同学习部队发给他的一本精装的《毛主席语录》，一边问父亲：家里活学活用毛主席著作搞得怎么样？奶奶把“老三篇”背会了没有？……金大爷看到儿子对毛主席这样的热爱，打心眼里高兴，刚想夸奖几句，但又立即收住了嘴，心里纳闷：孩子问这又问那，怎么就没有问到家里的革命大批判开展的怎么样？
    党的八届十二中全会决定把大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务，使小金子欣喜若狂。他盼望已久的心愿实现了，就感到格外轻松，革命大批判在他的心目中有点挂不上号了。但是，苦水里生、苦水里长的金大爷，经受过多少次阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪，又领教过多少次阶级敌人借尸还魂的教训啊！金大爷看到儿子流露出轻敌麻痹思想，就语重心长地说：“喜福，刘少奇及其同伙虽然已被我们打倒，但他们人还在，心不死，他们的流毒远远没有肃清。如果我们不把修正主义思想的毒根挖掉，它就会发杈生枝，就会毒害群众，我们的政权就难保啊！”
    小金子听到“政权”两个字，马上抬起头，挺直腰，全神贯注地倾听父亲的讲述。金大爷看着坐在自己面前的儿子，军容整洁，满面红光，更觉得儿子幸福可爱。饮水思源，今天的幸福生活，完全是毛主席给的。因此，教育儿子永远不忘本，牢牢记住毛主席有关阶级斗争和路线斗争的教导，是自己应尽的责任。他就叫小金子背诵毛主席的最新指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”小金子刚背完，金大爷就亲切地对儿子说：“毛主席的话字字句句说到咱们贫下中农的心坎上。阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的历史经验就是永远不能忘记！”说到这里，旧仇新恨一起涌上了他的心头。他提高嗓门气愤地说：“刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼，真是头上长疮，脚底流脓，坏透了！咱们打日本鬼子那阵子，刘少奇暗中帮助蒋介石，让日本鬼子在咱们国土上横行霸道，杀咱们中国人。你二大爷就是因为反抗鬼子抓劳工，被拴在车后把儿上给活活拖死了！”金大爷的音调有点变了。小金子恨得攥紧拳头，等待父亲继续讲下去。金大爷镇静了一下，又愤慨地说：“我八岁就给地主扛活，忍饥挨冻受煎熬，过着牛马不如的生活。你说这是什么原因啊？”小金子一挥拳头，坚定地回答：“就是因为我们没有掌握政权！”“对！”金大爷擦擦眼睛又想说下去。
    这时，小金子早就忍不住，愤怒地说：“刘少奇这个烂了肠子黑了心的坏家伙，在国民经济暂时困难时期又跳了出来，刮起‘三自一包’的黑风，把咱们生产队搞得一塌糊涂，害得咱们好苦啊！”金大爷听到儿子说出了自己的心里话，紧接着说：“这都是刘少奇布下的鬼圈套。”听到这里，小金子深有感触地大声背诵了毛主席语录：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。金大爷立刻接上去说：“对，我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。刘少奇现在是霜打的白菜，叶枯帮烂心没死啊！我们千万不能忘记革命大批判，我们要天天批，月月批，年年批，坚决把刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想批透批臭。”
    金大爷的一席话，使小金子深受教育。他向父亲检讨了自己的轻敌麻痹思想，保证永远不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，继续深入地开展革命大批判，不断提高自己的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。金大爷也表示，要坚决做抓革命的先锋，促生产的模范，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
