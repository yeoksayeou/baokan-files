Two million New York power and gas workers go on strike

Reflecting deepening class contradictions in the United States

	New York, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) — Two million power and gas workers in New York City began a major strike on Dec. 1, demanding wage increases.

	The strike by New York's power and gas workers reflects the deepening class contradictions within the United States. Due to domestic inflation and soaring prices, workers' real wages have been continuously declining. In recent periods, sanitation workers, telephone workers, and movers in New York City have successively gone on strike.

	The reactionary authorities in the United States are doing everything they can to sabotage this major strike. Monopoly capitalists are currently scheming to force 4,000 employees to replace the striking workers and are attempting to use reactionary unions to sell out workers' interests and sabotage the workers' strike struggle.

	However, the power and gas workers in New York, undeterred by threats and deception, are continuing their struggle.

	Peruvian students defy repression and take to the streets

	Quito, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) — University students in Machala, the capital of Ecuador's El Oro Province, held a demonstration on Nov. 21, protesting the government's educational policies.

	The demonstrators, undeterred by repression, engaged in fierce battles with reactionary military police.

	At noon, the demonstrators attacked the provincial government, ransacked the Machala City Police Headquarters, and occupied the military building.

	In addition, all high schools in Machala held class boycotts on Nov. 21, joining the university in the struggle.

	Recently, nearly 2,500 students from the National University of Engineering in Peru also took to the streets to protest against the school authorities. Additionally, this university recently held a 72-hour class boycott.

	Spanish students bravely fight police

	Protest against Franco regime's fascist tyranny

	Madrid, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) — University students in the Spanish capital of Madrid held massive demonstrations on Nov. 28 and 29, protesting the fascist authorities' violent suppression of the student movement. The demonstrators bravely fought against the reactionary military police sent to suppress them.

	About 1,000 Madrid University students, defying the reactionary school's ban, stormed the Political Economy Building of the university, occupied the dean's office and other school buildings, and protested against the authorities' persecution of progressive students and the sending of police to suppress the student movement. Their slogan was: "Drive the police out of the university!"

	The Spanish fascist authorities once again violently suppressed the students' struggle. The police's brutality further enraged the students, who retaliated with stones and homemade incendiary bombs. According to reports, 150 demonstrators were arrested that day.

	British university students occupy vice-chancellor's office

	Dissatisfied with aristocratic and bourgeois management of the school

	London, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) — About 1,000 students at the University of Birmingham held a meeting on Nov. 28, deciding to begin an indefinite sit-in protest within the school to protest the school authorities' refusal to allow students to participate in school management.

	After the meeting, several hundred students occupied the vice-chancellor's office and five other offices. The vice-chancellor of Birmingham University, Hunt, was publicly criticized by the students. According to reports, the students expressed dissatisfaction with the aristocratic and bourgeois management of the school.

    纽约两万电力煤气工人大罢工

    新华社一日讯　纽约消息：美国纽约市两万名电力和煤气工人一日开始举行大罢工，要求增加工资。
    纽约电力、煤气工人的这次大罢工，反映了美国国内阶级矛盾的深化。由于美国国内通货膨胀，物价飞涨，工人的实际工资不断下降。最近一个时期，纽约市的清洁工人、电话工人和搬运工人曾接连不断地举行了罢工。
    美国反动当局千方百计想破坏这次大罢工。垄断资本家目前正阴谋迫使四千名职员代替罢工工人工作，并企图利用反动工会出卖工人利益，破坏工人的罢工斗争。
    但是，纽约电力和煤气工人，不顾威胁和欺骗，正在坚持斗争。
