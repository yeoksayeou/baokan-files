After the People's Daily published on November 14th the suggestions by Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu regarding the transfer of all public primary schools to the production brigades for management, these suggestions have garnered widespread attention and sparked heated discussions nationwide. Over the past twenty days, various regional newspapers have published letters from workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers, and members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed in primary and secondary schools, engaging in discussions on this issue. As of December 7th, newspapers received include the PLA Daily, Guangming Daily, and 23 out of 29 provincial, municipal, and autonomous region newspapers that have opened discussions. These 23 newspapers are: Beijing Daily, Tianjin Daily, Inner Mongolia Daily, Liaoning Daily, Jilin Daily, Heilongjiang Daily, Shaanxi Daily, Gansu Daily, Ningxia Daily, Qinghai Daily, Dazhong Daily, Xinhua Daily, Xin Anhuibao, Wenhui Daily, Jiefang Daily, Henan Daily, Hunan Daily, Jiangxi Daily, Nanfang Daily, Guangxi Daily, Xin Guizhou Daily, Sichuan Daily, and Yunnan Daily.

Dazhong Daily, Wenhui Daily, Jiefang Daily, and Beijing Daily, among others, began discussions on this issue starting from November 15th. Many newspapers started discussions on the 16th and 17th of November. Currently, Dazhong Daily has held seven discussions, Guangming Daily and Jiefang Daily have held six, Inner Mongolia Daily has held five, and many other newspapers have held three to four discussions.

On December 2nd, the People's Daily published a selection of reader letters, furthering the discussion on how to manage primary and secondary schools in cities. Jiefang Daily, Wenhui Daily, Dazhong Daily, and Qinghai Daily, among others, also began discussions on the management of primary and secondary schools in cities starting from the 2nd and 3rd of December. Currently, eleven newspapers have started discussions on this topic. These newspapers are: Wenhui Daily, Jiefang Daily, Dazhong Daily, Qinghai Daily, Guangming Daily, Inner Mongolia Daily, Tianjin Daily, Xin Anhuibao, Jilin Daily, Henan Daily, and Xin Guizhou Daily.

The discussions in various regional newspapers cover a wide range of issues. Many newspapers have extensively discussed the advantages of transferring public primary schools to the production brigades for management, providing many vivid examples. There are also many good suggestions and opinions on whether primary and secondary schools in cities can be managed by factories or jointly by neighborhoods. Many comrades say: This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, an effective measure for preventing revisionism. Some newspapers in the discussions mentioned that this approach solves the problem of school leadership, ensuring that the leadership of schools is firmly in the hands of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants; managing primary and secondary schools in this way keeps schools from being detached from the three great revolutionary movements, and is a good method for reforming the teaching staff and promoting the thought revolution of teachers. The newspaper discussions also refute the malicious rumors of class enemies, focusing on resolving the ideological issues of the masses; through reasoning or personal experiences, it is explained that the production brigades are fully capable of managing primary schools well.

Dazhong Daily reported on the effects of initiating this discussion and transferring public primary schools to the production brigades for management. The Revolutionary Committee of Jiaxiang County in Shandong actively supported the suggestion published in the People's Daily, following Chairman Mao's teachings, carrying out revolutionary criticism, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and focusing on political and ideological work. All 643 public primary schools in the county have now been transferred to the production brigades for management, and the rural educational revolution has taken on an unprecedented new look. The cadres and teachers of Yiqiao Brigade in Dushan County, Guizhou, proposed that the brigade can solve the living problems of teachers in managing primary schools. Since 1964, the remuneration for teachers in their brigade-run primary school has been changed to a work-point system, and the brigade provides appropriate subsidies based on their political performance and family living conditions, ensuring that teachers' incomes have not decreased.

    各地报纸讨论动态
    人民日报十一月十四日登出侯振民、王庆余两位同志关于所有公办小学下放到大队来办的建议以后，在全国各地引起了普遍注意和极其热烈的反应。二十多天以来，在各地报纸上，相继刊登了工人、贫下中农、革命教师、进驻小学和中学的工人和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队队员的来信，就这个问题开展了讨论。截至十二月七日收到的报纸，解放军报、光明日报，和二十九个省、市、自治区报纸中的二十三个报纸，都开展了讨论。这二十三个报纸是：北京日报、天津日报、内蒙古日报、辽宁日报、吉林日报、黑龙江日报、陕西日报、甘肃日报、宁夏日报、青海日报、大众日报、新华日报、新安徽报、文汇报、解放日报、河南日报、湖南日报、江西日报、南方日报、广西日报、新贵州报、四川日报、云南日报。
    大众日报、文汇报、解放日报、北京日报等几个报纸，从十一月十五日起，就开始了这个问题的讨论。许多报纸分别从十一月十六日和十七日开始讨论。现在，大众日报已经讨论了七次，光明日报、解放日报讨论了六次，内蒙古日报讨论了五次，其他许多报纸讨论了三、四次。
    人民日报在十二月二日又刊登了一部分读者来信，进一步就城市的小学及中学应当如何办的问题开展讨论。解放日报、文汇报和大众日报、青海日报等几个报纸，也分别从二日和三日起，就城市小学和中学应当怎么办的问题开展讨论。现在，已有十一个报纸开始了这方面的讨论。这些报纸是：文汇报、解放日报、大众日报、青海日报、光明日报、内蒙古日报、天津日报、新安徽报、吉林日报、河南日报、新贵州报。
    各地报纸上的讨论，涉及到的问题比较广泛。
    不少的报纸比较充分地谈到了公办小学下放到大队办的优越性，发表了许多生动的材料。对城市的小学及中学可否由工厂办或由街道联合起来办的问题，也提出了许多很好的意见和建议，正在展开热烈的讨论。许多同志说：这是毛主席无产阶级教育路线的伟大胜利，是反修防修的有效措施。有些报纸在讨论中说，这样办解决了学校的领导权问题，使学校的领导大权牢牢地掌握在工人阶级和贫下中农手里；这样办小学和中学使学校不脱离三大革命运动，是改造教师队伍、促进教师思想革命化的好办法。报纸上的讨论，还驳斥了阶级敌人的恶意造谣，注意解决群众的思想问题；通过说理或用亲身经历，说明大队完全能够办好小学。
    大众日报报道了开展这个讨论和公办小学下放到大队来办的效果。山东嘉祥县革委会积极支持人民日报刊登的建议，根据毛主席的教导，开展革命大批判，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓政治思想工作，全县六百四十三处公办小学现已全部下放到大队办，农村教育革命出现了前所未有的新气象。贵州独山县一桥大队干部、教师提出：大队办小学，教师生活上的问题，大队可以解决。他们这个大队民办小学教师的报酬，从一九六四年起改为评工记分，大队根据其政治表现、家庭生活情况适当补助，教师收入并没有降低。
