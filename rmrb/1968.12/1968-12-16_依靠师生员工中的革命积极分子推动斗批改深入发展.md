Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Huazhong Institute of Technology insists on implementing proletarian political leadership, relying on revolutionary activists among faculty, students, and staff who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. They mobilize and lead the broad masses of revolutionary faculty, students, and staff to jointly fight, effectively promoting the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school.

After entering Huazhong Institute of Technology, the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "implementing the proletarian educational revolution, which must have the leadership of the working class, must have the participation of the working masses, and must, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, unite with the activists among students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end to form a revolutionary tripartite alliance." They conducted in-depth investigations and research among faculty, students, and staff, quickly forming a team of activists who have a strong sense of class struggle, high awareness of the struggle between the two lines, are trusted by the masses, and are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda team closely relies on them, supports their revolutionary actions, respects their pioneering spirit, and mobilizes them to solve some "old and difficult" problems. Under the education and help of the workers' propaganda team, they have become a powerful force in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and doing a good job in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. They have played a significant role in the revolutionary criticism and the work of cleaning up the class ranks.

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Huazhong Institute of Technology cultivates and educates activists who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end and, through them, unites and mobilizes the broad masses of revolutionary faculty, students, and staff to do a good job in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. The main methods are:

1. Arm the activists with Mao Zedong Thought and place them on the frontline of class struggle for tempering.

The workers' propaganda team believes that the fundamental way to cultivate activists is to arm them with Mao Zedong Thought. The workers' propaganda team held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the activists, studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, continuously deepening their understanding of the theory, line, principles, and policies of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strengthening their resolve to carry the revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda team also helped the activists conduct recollections and comparisons, giving them class education. Old workers used their bloody family histories to educate the activists to remember the bitterness of their class, to hold onto the hatred of blood, and to forever follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. These activities greatly deepened the activists' profound proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and greatly aroused their boundless hatred for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. They fought with high spirits and joined the great struggle of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The workers' propaganda team placed the activists on the frontline of class struggle, allowing them to grow and temper themselves in the great winds and waves of the revolution. A certain teaching and research section had complex class struggles, and the work of cleaning up the class ranks progressed slowly. With the help of the workers' propaganda team, the activists in this teaching and research section posted a big-character poster that exposed the cover of class struggle. The class enemies were terrified and tried every means to retaliate against those who wrote the big-character poster. The activists engaged in a head-on struggle with the class enemies, finally mobilizing the masses to root out the class enemies hiding among them, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and greatly suppressing the arrogance of the class enemies.

2. Grasp living thoughts, guide activists to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, and continue the revolution.

As the struggle against the enemy deepens, various living thoughts constantly arise in the minds of the activists. The workers' propaganda team, in response to these living thoughts, enthusiastically studied Mao Zedong Thought with them, had heart-to-heart talks, guided them to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, "promote achievements, correct errors, and prepare for future battles." After a handful of class enemies were exposed, some activists developed a blind optimism and complacency, thinking that "it's almost done," and that another round of criticism would suffice. The workers' propaganda team pointed out that this was an obstacle to deepening the work of cleaning up the class ranks and, together with them, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle," combined with the actual class struggle in their unit, and severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's theory of the "extinction of class struggle." Through study, they heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They said: Class enemies do not willingly die, we must keep our class struggle consciousness high and do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks.

3. Arm the activists with the proletarian policies of the Party, making them both daring and skilled in revolution.

In a certain class, a few students who had taken the wrong side had committed serious errors. Due to past antagonistic sentiments, many students advocated severe punishment for these few students. The workers' propaganda team and the activists studied together Chairman Mao's teachings on "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party" and "we must firmly believe that the majority of the masses are good, and that bad people are a very small number," guiding the activists to comprehensively analyze that these few students had been deceived by class enemies, that their backgrounds were miserable, that they were all class brothers, and that they should be enthusiastically united with and helped, together doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. After the activists' thoughts were clarified, they went to do the work of others, thus uniting all those who could be united and jointly engaging in the struggle against the enemy.

4. Educate activists to closely connect with the masses, unite and mobilize the broad masses of revolutionary faculty, students, and staff to jointly do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The workers' propaganda team, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on "only the combination of the enthusiasm of the leading cadres and the enthusiasm of the broad masses can avoid the futile busyness of a few people," helped activists who were not good at connecting with the masses to recognize that "the people have limitless creativity" and educated them to actively connect with the masses and mobilize the masses. Some students in the graduating class had the thought of waiting for graduation assignments and were not enthusiastic about participating in the movement. The activists took the initiative to form "red pairs" and "red groups" with these students, studying together Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fighting selfishness, uprooting revisionism, expressing their resolve, making these students actively join the battle, and launching a fierce attack on the class enemies.

At present, under the leadership of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the unity and mobilization of the activists, the broad masses of revolutionary faculty, students, and staff at Huazhong Institute of Technology are fighting with high spirits to carry out revolutionary criticism and the work of cleaning up the class ranks, steadily, accurately, and fiercely striking at a handful of class enemies, making the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation reach a new high tide.

    驻华中工学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队坚持实行无产阶级政治领导
    依靠师生员工中的革命积极分子推动斗批改深入发展
    宣传队培养决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子的作法是：一、用毛泽东思想武装积极分子，让他们在阶级斗争第一线锻炼；二、抓活思想，引导积极分子斗私批修；三、用党的政策武装积极分子，使他们敢于革命，善于革命；四、教育积极分子密切联系群众
    新华社武汉十五日电　驻华中工学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队在领导学校的斗、批、改中，坚持实行无产阶级政治领导，依靠师生员工中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，团结和带动广大革命师生员工共同战斗，有力地推动了学校斗、批、改的深入发展。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻华中工学院后，认真学习了毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合”的最新指示，深入到师生员工中进行调查研究，迅速组成一支阶级斗争观念强、两条路线斗争觉悟高、群众信得过的决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子队伍。工人宣传队紧密地依靠他们，支持他们的革命行动，尊重他们的首创精神，发动他们解决一些“老大难”问题。在工人宣传队的教育和帮助下，他们成为落实毛主席最新指示、搞好学校斗、批、改的一支有生力量，在革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作中发挥了显著的作用。
    驻华中工学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队培养、教育决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，并通过他们去团结、带动广大革命师生员工，搞好学校斗、批、改的主要作法是：
    一、用毛泽东思想武装积极分子，并把他们放到阶级斗争的第一线去锻炼。
    工人宣传队认为，培养积极分子的根本，就是用毛泽东思想武装他们。工人宣传队为积极分子举办了毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，不断加深他们对无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的理解，增强他们将革命进行到底的决心。工人宣传队还帮助积极分子开展回忆对比，对他们进行阶级教育。老工人用血泪斑斑的家史，教育积极分子不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。这些活动，大大加深了积极分子无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，大大激发了积极分子对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的无比仇恨，他们斗志昂扬地投入了斗、批、改的伟大斗争。
    工人宣传队把积极分子放到阶级斗争第一线，让他们在革命的大风大浪中锻炼成长。有个教研室阶级斗争复杂，清理阶级队伍的工作进展迟缓。这个教研室的积极分子在工人宣传队帮助下，贴出了揭开阶级斗争盖子的大字报。阶级敌人惊恐万状，想方设法打击报复写大字报的人。积极分子与阶级敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争，终于带动群众，把混在群众中的阶级敌人揪了出来，大长了革命群众的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。
    二、抓活思想，引导积极分子斗私批修，不断革命。
    随着对敌斗争的深入发展，积极分子头脑中不断出现各种活思想。工人宣传队针对这些活思想，满腔热情地和他们共同学习毛泽东思想，同他们交心谈心，引导他们斗私批修，“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战。”一小撮阶级敌人被揪出后，有些积极分子产生了盲目乐观、麻痹轻敌情绪，认为“差不多了”，再批一批就行了。工人宣传队指出，这是深入开展清理阶级队伍工作的阻力，便和他们一起反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，结合本单位阶级斗争的实际，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。通过学习，他们提高了阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们说：阶级敌人是不甘心死亡的，我们一定要把阶级斗争观念提得高高的，认真做好清理阶级队伍的工作。
    三、用党的无产阶级政策武装积极分子，使他们既敢于革命，又善于革命。
    有一个班上，有几个站错队的同学犯有严重错误。由于过去对立情绪较重，不少同学主张对这几个同学给以严厉处分。工人宣传队便和积极分子一起，学习毛主席“政策和策略是党的生命”、“要坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数”的教导，引导积极分子全面分析这几个同学是受了阶级敌人的蒙蔽，他们出身很苦，都是阶级弟兄，应该满腔热情地团结、帮助他们，一起搞好斗、批、改。积极分子思想通了后，又去做其他人的工作，这样就团结了一切可以团结的人，共同投入对敌斗争。
    四、教育积极分子密切联系群众，团结、带动广大革命师生员工一起，认真搞好斗、批、改。
    工人宣传队遵照毛主席关于“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙”的教导，帮助不善于联系群众的积极分子认识“人民群众有无限的创造力”，教育他们主动去联系群众，发动群众。毕业班有些同学有等待毕业分配的思想，不积极参加运动。积极分子就主动和这些同学结成“一对红”、“一组红”，一起学习毛主席的最新指示，斗私心，挖修根，表决心，使这些同学积极投入战斗，向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。
    目前，华中工学院的广大革命师生员工，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队领导下，在积极分子的团结、带动下，正在斗志昂扬地开展革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，使学校的斗、批、改出现了新高潮。
