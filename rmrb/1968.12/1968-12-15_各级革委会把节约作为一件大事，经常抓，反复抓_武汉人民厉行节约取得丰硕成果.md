At all levels, revolutionary committees have prioritized frugality as a major task, consistently and repeatedly emphasizing it. The people of Wuhan have achieved remarkable results through rigorous frugality.

According to incomplete statistics, the city has saved 12% more coal this year compared to last year, 40% more steel, and approximately 10% more rubber. By utilizing old materials and waste, the city has saved the nation 540 million yuan.

The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, while intensifying the struggle between the two lines, has consistently emphasized the implementation of Chairman Mao's great policies of "building the country through frugality" and "advancing revolution through further frugality." This is seen as a crucial part of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The committee has mobilized the revolutionary people of the entire city to further carry forward the Party's fine tradition of hard work and frugality, achieving remarkable results.

According to incomplete statistics up to now, Wuhan has saved more coal this year compared to last year, with an increase of more than 12%. The amount of steel saved has increased by 40%, rubber by about 10%, and machine oil by more than 6%. The savings in other important materials and financial expenditures have also seen significant increases. Just by utilizing old materials and waste, the city has saved the nation 540 million yuan.

The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "ensure that comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard work and self-reliance," has made "practicing frugality and opposing waste" a major revolutionary measure to prevent revisionism, consolidate the new proletarian revolutionary power, and carry the struggle between the two lines to the end.

In January and February of this year, as various levels of revolutionary committees were being established in the Wuhan region, a handful of unrepentant class enemies attempted to spread the counter-revolutionary wind of economism. The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee convened an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee to use Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and his latest instructions as sharp weapons. They analyzed this new trend in class struggle, deeply recognizing that frugality is the characteristic of the proletariat, while extravagance and waste are the traits of the bourgeoisie. Frugality versus waste is a sharp struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. Only by inheriting and carrying forward the Party's tradition of hard work and self-reliance can we thoroughly smash the class enemy's sugar-coated bullets, resolutely resist the counter-revolutionary wind of economism, continually consolidate and develop the new revolutionary committees, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. After thorough discussion, the committee unanimously passed a decision to quickly launch a new wave of the frugality movement and established a frugality group within the production command center of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee to specifically oversee this work.

Consistently and repeatedly propagating Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on "building the country through frugality," making them known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts, is a fundamental experience of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee in continuously organizing new waves of the frugality movement. Various levels of revolutionary committees in Wuhan have dispatched Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to widely propagate the profound significance of Chairman Mao's great policies of "building the country through frugality" and "advancing revolution through further frugality." They have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes focused on implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "advancing revolution through further frugality," deeply criticizing the revolutionary line of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism, and earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions. Throughout the city, a strong political atmosphere of "honoring frugality and shaming waste" has quickly been created, and the great frugality movement has flourished.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any leading cadre who does not gain concrete experience from individual units and individuals must not be able to provide general guidance to all units." The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's instructions, has conducted in-depth investigations and research at the grassroots level, timely summarized typical experiences, and promoted the citywide frugality movement to continue advancing.

In recent months, the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, based on investigations and research, has held nearly twenty large and small on-site meetings on saving manpower, financial expenditures, coal, oil, copper, and yarn. They have organized exhibitions on frugality and promoted the advanced experiences of frugality from 29 units, including the Wuhan Chemical Factory, Wuhan Steelworks Coke Plant, and Wuhan Automobile Transport Company. The common experience of these units is to firmly grasp the struggle between the two lines in the economic field without deviation, and to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policies of "building the country through frugality" and "advancing revolution through further frugality" as an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee has firmly relied on the broad masses of workers to vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution in the frugality movement. The workers of Wuhan, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, have always been at the forefront of practicing frugality. They have broken various unreasonable regulations, adopted new technologies, and extensively carried out activities to utilize old and waste materials, ensuring the full implementation of Chairman Mao's great policies of "building the country through frugality" and "advancing revolution through further frugality." This year, the number of innovations in various types of boilers in the first three quarters has exceeded the total of the previous three years. After modification, boilers generally save about 25% of coal, with some saving over 40%. Many factories have also used plastic to replace copper for making parts. In a few months, the city has produced over 100 new products using "plastic instead of copper," saving the nation a large amount of copper and significantly reducing production costs.

    各级革委会把节约作为一件大事，经常抓，反复抓
    武汉人民厉行节约取得丰硕成果
    据目前不完全统计，全市今年节约煤炭比去年增加百分之十二以上，节约钢材比去年增加百分之四十，仅利用旧料废物一项，就为国家节约资金五百四十万元
    新华社武汉十四日电　武汉市革命委员会在狠抓两条路线的斗争中，一直把认真贯彻毛主席关于“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针，作为贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要组成部分，广泛发动全市革命人民进一步发扬党的艰苦奋斗的优良作风，厉行节约，取得了丰硕成果。据至目前为止的不完全统计，武汉全市今年节约煤炭的数量比去年增加百分之十二以上，节约钢材的数量比去年增加百分之四十，节约橡胶的数量比去年增加百分之十左右，节约机油的数量比去年增加百分之六以上。节约的其他重要物资和财政开支的数量，也都比去年有较大幅度的增长。仅利用旧料废物一项，就为国家节约资金五百四十万元。
    武汉市革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，把“厉行节约、反对浪费”作为反修、防修，巩固新生的无产阶级革命政权，将两条路线斗争进行到底的一项重大革命措施。
    今年一、二月间，正当武汉地区各级革委会纷纷建立起来的时候，一小撮不甘心灭亡的阶级敌人，重新刮起反革命经济主义妖风。武汉市革命委员会专门为此召开了常委扩大会议，以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和一系列最新指示为锐利武器，分析了阶级斗争的这一新动向，深刻地认识到：勤俭节约是无产阶级的本色，铺张浪费是资产阶级的特性，节约还是浪费，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争。只有继承和发扬党的艰苦奋斗的作风，才能彻底粉碎阶级敌人糖衣炮弹的进攻，坚决抵制反革命经济主义妖风，不断巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。经过充分讨论，革委会一致通过了关于迅速掀起厉行节约的群众运动新高潮的决定，并在市革委会生产指挥组里设立了厉行节约小组，专门负责抓好这一工作。
    经常地、反复地宣传毛主席“勤俭建国”的光辉思想，使之家喻户晓，深入人心，是武汉市革命委员会不断组织厉行节约的群众运动新高潮的一条根本经验。武汉市各级革委会纷纷派出毛泽东思想宣传队，广泛宣传毛主席关于“勤俭建国”“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针的深远意义，举办各种类型的以贯彻毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”方针为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展对刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判，扎扎实实地落实毛主席的光辉指示，在全市范围内，迅速造成了“以勤俭节约为荣，以铺张浪费为耻”的浓厚政治空气，厉行节约的伟大群众运动蓬勃兴起。
    毛主席教导我们说：“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导。”武汉市革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，深入基层调查研究，及时总结典型经验，推动全市厉行节约的群众运动不断向前发展。
    几个月来，市革委会在调查研究的基础上，先后召开了节约人力、节约财政开支、节约用煤、节约用油、节约用铜、节约用纱等大小现场会议近二十次，举办了厉行节约的展览，推广了武汉化工厂、武钢焦化厂、武汉汽车运输公司等二十九个单位厉行节约的先进经验。这些单位的共同经验是，狠抓经济领域里两条路线的斗争不转向，把坚决贯彻执行毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针作为忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。
    武汉市革命委员会坚决依靠广大工人群众，在厉行节约运动中大力开展技术革新和技术革命。具有光荣革命传统的武汉地区工人阶级，一直是厉行节约的先锋，他们大破各种不合理的规章制度，采用新技术，广泛开展利旧利废、节约代用活动，使毛主席关于“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针得到全面贯彻。今年一至三季度革新各种类型的锅炉的数量就超过前三年的总和，经过改造的锅炉，一般可以节约用煤百分之二十五左右，最多可达百分之四十以上。许多工厂还利用塑料代铜材制造零件，几个月来，全市“塑料代铜”生产出的新产品达一百多种，既为国家节省了大批铜材，又大大降低了生产成本。
