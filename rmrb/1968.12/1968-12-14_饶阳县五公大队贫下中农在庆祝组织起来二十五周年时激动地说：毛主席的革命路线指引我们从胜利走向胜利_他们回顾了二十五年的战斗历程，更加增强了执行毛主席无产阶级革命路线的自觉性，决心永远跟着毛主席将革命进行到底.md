The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong Brigade in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of their response to Chairman Mao's call to "organize" and embark on the socialist collectivization path. They linked their experiences to the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and enthusiastically celebrating the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said, the 25 years of Wugong's organization is 25 years of following the great leader Chairman Mao, 25 years of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line defeating the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Over the past 25 years, the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought has shone upon Wugong, transforming it from a poor village into a mechanized and electrified socialist new countryside amidst the storms of class struggle. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, recalling the 25-year struggle, said with great emotion: It is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that has guided us from victory to victory. In the future, we must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the end.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly and repeatedly spoken about. It is not enough to speak to a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Wugong Brigade, who are celebrating their 25th anniversary of walking the socialist path, are guided by Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They reviewed Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, studied Chairman Mao's series of teachings on the socialist revolution and construction in rural areas, and studied Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They summarized the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines in their brigade over the past 25 years and fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi. Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the entire brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres further heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, further strengthening their awareness of executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong embarked on the socialist path under Chairman Mao's great call to "organize." Soon after the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant speech "Organize," at the end of 1943, four impoverished peasants from Wugong Village—Geng Changsuo, Qiao Wanyang, Lu Mulin, and Li Yantian—followed Chairman Mao's great teachings and established the "Land Partnership" during the anti-Japanese war, embarking on the path of organization. From then until now, over the past 25 years, Wugong Village has been permeated with the fierce struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents attempted to destroy Wugong Village's socialist collective economy more than ten times using threats, bribes, and killings. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong stood firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, repelling various forms of attacks by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and continuing to advance along the socialist path guided by Chairman Mao.

In 1949, Chairman Mao made an extremely important report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, pointing out: "For the scattered individual peasant economy and handicraft economy, we must cautiously, gradually, and actively guide them towards modernization and collectivization," and "we must organize production, consumption, and credit cooperatives." However, Liu Shaoqi, together with his agents in Hebei Province, peddled the black goods of "getting rich" in the old liberated areas, attempting to promote capitalism in the countryside. This evil wind struck the "Land Partnership" in Wugong. Geng Changsuo and other poor and lower-middle peasants who joined the "Land Partnership" used Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee as their weapon, exposing and smashing the plot by a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to sabotage the "Land Partnership." They said: "We will definitely walk the road of common prosperity guided by Chairman Mao; we will never take the backward road of the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer."

In 1951, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong, following Chairman Mao's teachings, transformed the "Land Partnership" into a primary agricultural production cooperative. That year, relying on the collective economy, they dug four brick wells, developed water conservancy, and increased grain yield per mu to over 400 jin, demonstrating the superiority of the cooperative. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed agricultural collectivization, saying that elevating the agricultural production mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives was "a mistaken, dangerous, and utopian agricultural socialist thought," and that "universally implementing agricultural cooperatives to advance towards socialism is an illusion," and so on. In 1952, Liu Shaoqi further instructed his agents in North China to call Geng Changsuo to Beijing for a meeting, criticizing him as a "bad example" and ranting about how "cooperatives are reactionary, utopian, and backward." Facing the enemy's howls, Geng Changsuo thought of Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, with each family being a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule and makes the peasants themselves perpetually impoverished. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only road to collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." Geng Changsuo used Chairman Mao's teachings to resist the pressure from the capitalist-roaders within the Party. Upon returning to Wugong, he discarded the black words of the capitalist-roaders and led the poor and lower-middle peasants to continue advancing, achieving full collectivization in the village in 1953.

Later, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong Village, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, smashed Liu Shaoqi and his agents' plot to slash cooperatives in Wugong Village, transforming the primary cooperative into a higher-level agricultural production cooperative in 1955, and then establishing a people's commune in 1958. Wugong Village became a brigade of the commune. In the first year of the commune's establishment, the grain yield per mu in Wugong Brigade increased to over 500 jin, surpassing any previous year. The poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully said: "The higher-level cooperative is stronger than the primary cooperative, and the people's commune is even stronger than the higher-level cooperative. It's like sesame flowers blooming higher and higher. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership and the superiority of organization!"

However, the class enemies were not willing to admit defeat. During the period of severe natural disasters and temporary economic difficulties, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, took advantage of the opportunity to peddle the black goods of "three freedoms and one contract," attempting to restore capitalism. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong Brigade, using Chairman Mao's teaching of "people's communes are good" as their weapon, resisted Liu Shaoqi's gale of individual farming. Not long after, the great "Four Cleanups" movement began. Liu Shaoqi's agents in Hebei Province took the opportunity to bring Liu Shaoqi's concocted black "experience" from Taoyuan to Wugong Brigade, attacking Geng Changsuo and other revolutionary cadres. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong stood firm, clearly distinguishing between right and wrong. They repelled Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and ensured the smooth development of the "Four Cleanups" movement.

The surging and roaring Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was the great showdown between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Wugong Brigade over the past 25 years. During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Wugong Brigade resolutely executed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, smashing the bourgeois reactionary line of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and severely striking down a small handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who attempted to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and cut down the red flag of Wugong. The entire brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses followed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieving revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, carrying out revolutionary great criticism, purging the class ranks, conducting party rectification, and making the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in Wugong fly even higher, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line even more deeply rooted in Wugong.

The poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and the broad masses of Wugong Brigade, linking their experiences to the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, said with deep proletarian emotions: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the line for us poor and lower-middle peasants to rise up and seek liberation; it is the line to forever prevent the proletarian dictatorship from changing color and the socialist mountains from changing color. Regarding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must always follow, forever follow, and follow to the end! Based on the 25-year struggle experience, they believed that to forever follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must:

1. Strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions. They said, what is executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? Chairman Mao's brilliant works and latest instructions are the guidelines, and every sentence is a treasure. Study and act upon them, and that is executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

2. To follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must resolutely struggle against the opportunistic lines of "left" and "right." Struggle in the past, struggle now, and struggle in the future, struggle to the end.

3. The center of the struggle between the two lines is the issue of power. To safeguard the proletarian dictatorship, one must have those who hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in power. Cadres must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, never detach from the masses, and put leading the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work.

4. One must smash the bourgeois "self" and establish the proletarian "public." They said, the more one smashes the "self" and establishes the "public" in one's mind, the more resolutely one executes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

5. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the line of believing in and relying on the masses. One must directly hand over Mao Zedong Thought to the broad revolutionary masses. When the masses directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can consciously resist and criticize the revisionist line, prevent the restoration of capitalism; they can turn Mao Zedong Thought, this spiritual atomic bomb, into boundless material force, pushing the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction forward in great strides.

    饶阳县五公大队贫下中农在庆祝组织起来二十五周年时激动地说：
    毛主席的革命路线指引我们从胜利走向胜利
    他们回顾了二十五年的战斗历程，更加增强了执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，决心永远跟着毛主席将革命进行到底
    新华社石家庄十三日电　河北省饶阳县五公公社五公大队的广大贫下中农和社员，最近在庆祝他们响应毛主席发出的“组织起来”的伟大号召，走上社会主义集体化道路二十五周年的时候，联系实际，认真学习两条路线斗争史，热烈颂扬毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，热烈欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。他们说，五公组织起来的二十五年，是紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的二十五年，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜以叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线的二十五年。二十五年来，伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照耀着五公，使五公在阶级斗争的风浪中，由一个贫困的村庄变为机械化、电气化的社会主义新农村。广大贫下中农回顾二十五年的战斗历程，无比激动地说，是毛主席的革命路线指引我们从胜利走向胜利，我们今后一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，沿着毛主席的革命路线革命到底。
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”正在庆祝自己走上社会主义道路二十五周年的五公大队的贫下中农和革命干部，在毛主席的这一最新指示指引下，重温了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，学习了毛主席关于农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一系列教导，学习了毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，总结了本大队二十五年来两条路线斗争的历史经验，狠批了党内头号走资派刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。通过两条路线斗争史的学习，全大队贫下中农和革命干部进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，更加增强了他们执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性。
    五公的贫下中农是在毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召下走上社会主义道路的。伟大领袖毛主席的光辉讲话《组织起来》发表不久，在一九四三年年底，五公村的耿长锁、乔万象、卢墨林、李砚田等四户贫苦农民，就遵照毛主席的伟大教导，在抗日战争的烽火中，成立了“土地合伙组”，踏上了组织起来的道路。从那时到现在二十五年来，五公村始终贯串着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。大叛徒刘少奇及其代理人曾经十多次用威吓、利诱、砍杀等恶毒手段，妄图把五公村的社会主义集体经济摧毁。但是，五公的贫下中农坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，击退了刘少奇及其代理人各种形式的进攻，始终沿着毛主席指引的社会主义道路奋勇前进。
    一九四九年，毛主席在七届二中全会上作了极为重要的报告，指出：对分散的个体的农业经济和手工业经济“必须谨慎地、逐步地而又积极地引导它们向着现代化和集体化的方向发展”，“必须组织生产的、消费的和信用的合作社”。但是刘少奇却伙同他在河北省的代理人，在老解放区大肆兜售“发家致富”的黑货，企图在农村大搞资本主义。这股邪风冲击着五公的“土地合伙组”。耿长锁同志和其他加入“土地合伙组”的贫下中农一起，以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为武器，识破并且粉碎了党内一小撮走资派妄图破坏“土地合伙组”的阴谋。他们说：“咱们走毛主席指引的共同富裕的道路是走定了；咱们绝不走穷的穷、富的富的回头路。”
    一九五一年，五公的贫下中农遵照毛主席的教导，把“土地合伙组”转成了初级农业生产合作社。这一年，大家依靠集体经济，打了四眼砖井，发展了水利，使粮食亩产量达到四百多斤，显示了合作社的优越性。而大叛徒刘少奇却拚命反对农业合作化，说什么把农业生产互助组织提高到农业生产合作社“是一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想”，“普遍地实行农业合作社以走向社会主义，那是幻想”，等等。一九五二年，刘少奇更进一步指使他在华北的代理人，把耿长锁同志叫到北京开会，当作“坏典型”在会上批判，大肆叫嚣什么“合作社是反动的，空想的，落后的”。在敌人的嚎叫面前，耿长锁同志想起了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”耿长锁用毛主席的教导，顶住了党内走资派的压力，他回到五公后，把走资派的黑话丢在一边，带领贫下中农继续前进，一九五三年全村实现了合作化。
    五公村的贫下中农以后又以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，粉碎了刘少奇及其代理人在五公村大砍合作社的阴谋，在一九五五年把初级社转为高级农业生产合作社，接着在一九五八年，又办起了人民公社，五公村成为公社的一个大队。公社成立的第一年，五公大队的粮食亩产量就提高到五百多斤，超过了历史上任何一年。贫下中农高兴地说：“高级社比初级社强，人民公社比高级社更强，真是芝麻开花节节高，这都是毛主席领导的好，是组织起来的优越性啊！”
    可是，阶级敌人是不甘心失败的。在连续遭受三年严重自然灾害国民经济发生暂时困难时期，党内头号走资派刘少奇又利用这个机会，大肆贩卖“三自一包”的黑货，妄图复辟资本主义。五公大队的贫下中农以毛主席“人民公社好”的教导为武器，顶住了刘少奇刮起的单干妖风。时间没过多久，伟大的“四清”运动开始了。刘少奇在河北的代理人又趁机把刘少奇炮制的桃园黑“经验”搬到五公大队来，打击耿长锁同志和其他革命干部。五公的贫下中农立场坚定，爱憎分明，他们杀退了刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保证了“四清”运动顺利地开展。
    汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命，是五公大队二十五年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战。在文化大革命中，五公的贫下中农和革命干部坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，粉碎了党内头号走资派刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，狠狠地打击了妄图破坏文化大革命，妄图砍倒五公这面红旗的一小撮地、富、反、坏、右分子。全大队的贫下中农和革命群众紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，实现了革命大联合、革命三结合，开展了革命大批判，清理了阶级队伍，进行了整党建党，使毛泽东思想伟大红旗在五公举得更高，毛主席的革命路线在五公更加深入人心。
    五公大队的贫下中农、革命干部和广大社员，联系实际学习了两条路线的斗争史，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情激动地说：毛主席的革命路线，是我们贫下中农翻身求解放的路线，是永保无产阶级政权不变质，社会主义江山不变色的路线。对于毛主席的革命路线，我们要时时跟，永远跟，跟到底！他们根据二十五年来的斗争经验，认为要永远紧跟毛主席的革命路线，就必须做到：
    一，不折不扣地照毛主席的指示办事。他们说，什么是执行毛主席的革命路线？毛主席的光辉著作和最新指示，句句是纲，篇篇是宝，学了就做，就是执行毛主席的革命路线。
    二，紧跟毛主席的革命路线，就要同“左”右倾机会主义路线作坚决的斗争。过去斗，现在斗，今后还要斗，永远斗到底。
    三，两条路线斗争的中心是政权问题。要保住无产阶级政权，必须由高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的人来掌权。干部要活学活用毛泽东思想，永远不脱离群众，并把带领群众活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。
    四，要大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字。他们说，在头脑里越搞破私立公，执行毛主席的革命路线越坚决。
    五，毛主席的革命路线是相信和依靠人民群众的路线，必须把毛泽东思想直接交给广大革命群众掌握。群众直接掌握了毛泽东思想，就能自觉抵制和批判修正主义路线，防止资本主义复辟；就能使毛泽东思想这个精神原子弹，变为无穷无尽的物质力量，推动社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业阔步前进。
