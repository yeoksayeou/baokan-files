The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Guangxi have deeply felt through their study of the history of the struggle between the two lines that following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is victory.

A great wind of the revolutionary style of learning that combines theory with practice is sweeping across the entire region, linking the fate of individuals, the nation, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line closely together, and more firmly establishing the resolve to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 16th: The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in the midst of deeply carrying out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, have vigorously promoted the revolutionary style of learning that Chairman Mao personally advocates, which combines theory with practice. This has powerfully driven forward the region's struggle, criticism, and transformation, and accelerated the pace of the region's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee was reissued and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be frequently discussed and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," were issued, the revolutionary committees at various levels and local troops in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region immediately dispatched over a million people to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. In cities, factories, rural areas, and the military, they extensively established Mao Zedong Thought study classes with Chairman Mao's brilliant report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their guide, focusing on studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. The broad masses of workers and peasants said: Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of the proletariat and the working people. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the struggle between the two lines, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must discuss it every day, every month, every year, and from generation to generation. We must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example and, in the struggle between the two lines, always stand firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers actively learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought, studying deeply and well the history of the struggle between the two lines. The most fundamental experience is to vigorously promote the revolutionary style of learning that Chairman Mao personally advocates, which combines theory with practice. The Mao Nong ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants in Xianan Commune, Xianan Brigade, in Huanjiang County, reviewed the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines nationwide, in the region, and in their own brigade. When Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Guangxi ruthlessly dismantled cooperatives, they firmly followed Chairman Mao's words and unshakably took the road of agricultural collectivization, establishing mutual aid teams and cooperatives. They followed Chairman Mao's great instruction, "The people's commune is good," and resisted Liu Shaoqi's frenzied opposition to the three red banners, vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist tide of "three freedoms and one contract," making the people's commune more solid. When Chairman Mao called for "agriculture to learn from Dazhai," they self-reliantly built mountain reservoirs, completely changing the past situation of "water as precious as oil, nine years out of ten with no harvest." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they followed the series of latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, smashing the evil wind of a handful of class enemies attempting to restore capitalism, grasping revolution, and vigorously promoting production. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, this brigade underwent a tremendous change, with Mao Zedong Thought widely spread, transforming from a grain-deficient team to a surplus team that annually contributes 180,000 jin of patriotic grain. During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, popularizing primary and junior high school education. From nineteen years of practice in the struggle between the two lines, they deeply felt that following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is victory and happiness. This style of learning and method of study, which combines theory with practice and applies Mao Zedong Thought in real struggles, has made the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers closely link their personal fate, the fate of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, and the fate of the nation with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, more firmly establishing the resolve to follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

In studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers both regard themselves as a force in the revolution and as an object of the revolution. Under the leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, the broad revolutionary teachers and students of Guangxi University, in studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, angrily exposed Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Guangxi and within the school who opposed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, disrupted military and political training, disrupted revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and actively collaborated with the series of counter-revolutionary crimes carried out in the February Countercurrent of 1967 and this spring's evil wind to reverse the February Countercurrent; at the same time, they examined themselves in light of Chairman Mao's teachings on how they thought and acted in the sharp and complex class struggle, greatly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The broad revolutionary teachers and students resolutely declared that in the long revolutionary journey ahead, they would more consciously stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, be loyal to the soul and heart of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and follow it closely for life.

In studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the number of Mao Zedong Thought study classes held throughout the region is increasing and improving. For example: holding study classes at advanced model points where the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought is good and awareness of the struggle between the two lines is high, so that students receive vivid and specific education on the struggle between the two lines; Red Guards, cadre, and revolutionary intellectuals use the method of "going out and inviting in," flocking to factories and rural areas to learn from workers and peasants, receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers; in "difficult" units, holding "poking the hornet's nest" study classes, extensively discussing class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, extensively exposing the covers of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, launching struggles against enemies, and making the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines yield immediate results.

    广西广大工农兵群众通过两条路线斗争史的学习深刻体会到
    沿着毛主席的革命路线前进就是胜利
    大兴理论联系实际的革命学风，把个人的命运、国家的命运同毛主席的革命路线紧紧连结在一起，更牢固地树立起紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命的决心
    据新华社南宁十六日电　广西壮族自治区广大工农兵群众，在深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，大兴毛主席亲自倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，有力地推动了全区的斗、批、改，加快了全区斗、批、改的步伐。
    毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告重新发表和毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表后，广西壮族自治区各级革命委员会和各地驻军，立即派出了一百多万人的毛泽东思想宣传队，在城市、工矿、农村、部队普遍开办了以毛主席在七届二中全会上的光辉报告和毛主席的最新指示为指南，深入学习两条路线斗争史为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。广大工农兵说：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是无产阶级和劳动人民的生命线。我们就是要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘两条路线斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。毛主席的革命路线，我们就是要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，世世代代讲。我们要以林副主席为光辉榜样，在两条路线的斗争中，始终不渝地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，永生永世忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    广大工农兵活学活用毛泽东思想，学深学好两条路线斗争史的最基本的经验，就是大兴毛主席亲自倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风。环江县下南公社下南大队毛难族贫下中农，在学习两条路线斗争史中，回顾了全国、全区和本大队两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争历程。当刘少奇及其在广西的代理人大砍合作社时，他们坚决听毛主席的话，坚定不移地走农业集体化的道路，办起了互助组、合作社。他们遵照毛主席“人民公社好”的伟大指示，顶住了刘少奇掀起的疯狂反对三面红旗，大肆推行“三自一包”的反革命修正主义逆流，把人民公社办得更加巩固。毛主席号召“农业学大寨”，他们就自力更生修建山塘水库，彻底改变过去“滴水贵如油，十年九不收”的干旱状况。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人刮起的妄图复辟资本主义的妖风，狠抓革命，猛促生产。在毛主席革命路线的指引下，这个大队发生了天翻地覆的变化，毛泽东思想大普及，由缺粮队变为每年交售十八万斤爱国粮的余粮队。在文化大革命中，贫下中农管理了学校，普及了小学和初中教育。他们从十九年来两条路线斗争实践中，深深体会到：沿着毛主席的革命路线前进就是胜利，就是幸福。这种在现实斗争中对毛泽东思想活学活用、理论联系实际的革命学风和学习方法，使广大工农兵把个人的命运、工人阶级和贫下中农的命运、国家的命运，同毛主席的革命路线紧紧地连结在一起，更牢固地树立起紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命的决心。
    广大工农兵在两条路线斗争史的学习中，既把自己当作革命的一分力量，又把自己当作革命的对象。广西大学的广大革命师生，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，在两条路线斗争史的学习中，愤怒地控诉了刘少奇在广西和校内的代理人对抗毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏军政训练，破坏革命大联合和革命三结合，积极配合一九六七年的“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案的妖风所进行的一系列反革命罪恶勾当；同时对照毛主席的教导，检查自己在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中是怎么想和怎么做的，大大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大革命师生坚决表示，在今后长期的革命征途中，要更自觉地站在毛主席革命路线一边，对毛主席的革命路线要忠彻灵魂红透心，一生一世紧紧跟。
    在两条路线斗争史的学习中，全区举办的毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。例如：到活学活用毛泽东思想好、两条路线斗争觉悟高的先进样板点上去办学习班，使学员受到生动、具体的两条路线斗争教育；红卫兵小将、机关干部和革命知识分子，采用“走出去，请进来”的方法，纷纷到工厂、农村中去，拜工农为师，接受工农兵再教育；在“老大难”单位举办“捅马蜂窝”的学习班，大讲特讲阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，大揭阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的盖子，展开对敌斗争，使两条路线斗争史的学习收到了立竿见影的效果。
