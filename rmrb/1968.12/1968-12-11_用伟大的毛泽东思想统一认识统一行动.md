The Tianzhu County Revolutionary Committee leads the entire county's people in struggle to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works

The Tianzhu County Revolutionary Committee in Guizhou Province, since its establishment in March 1967, has firmly grasped the fundamental issues without deviation. It has insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thinking of the entire county, bringing about tremendous changes.

Tianzhu is a border county in Guizhou Province with a population of 210,000, of whom 80 percent are from the Dong ethnic minority. During the great proletarian cultural revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated among the broad masses of the people throughout the county.

In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, following the instructions of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, madly blocked the voice of Chairman Mao and vehemently opposed the poor and lower-middle peasants from reading Chairman Mao's books. For the poor and lower-middle peasants to obtain a copy of Chairman Mao's book was as difficult as climbing to the sky. Now, in every one of the 45,000-plus households in the county, there is a copy of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The county has organized 2,300-plus Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, mainly composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, with the militia as the backbone, totaling 25,000-plus propagandists. A powerful network of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda has been established, reaching every corner of the cities and countryside. Many women peasants carrying babies, young students who can barely read, and elderly poor peasants have voluntarily joined the propaganda efforts. The county's 2,245 production brigades, spread over 4,700-plus square kilometers of land, can disseminate Chairman Mao's latest directives to every person within 20-plus hours of their publication.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militia, and revolutionary cadres consciously demand of themselves that loyalty to Chairman Mao must be shown through actions. They follow Chairman Mao's latest directives and the battle cries issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin step by step, firmly implementing them.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militia, and revolutionary cadres have turned the idea of "studying Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime and being good peasants for a lifetime" into conscious actions. Everyone insists on reading Chairman Mao's works every day, and in everything they do, they do not deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings. During harvests, they first think of Chairman Mao and hand over the earliest and best-quality new grain to the state. The county completed the summer and autumn grain procurement tasks at an unprecedented speed, leading the entire province. The broad masses of community members love the collective, everyone strives to be advanced, and each person contributes. Truly, "people change their minds, the land changes its appearance, and Tianzhu presents a new scene!"

In the intense struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the various levels of revolutionary committees in Tianzhu County have armed the entire county's people with Mao Zedong Thought, unified understanding, steps, and actions, ensuring the victorious development of the proletarian cultural revolution in the entire county. In the process of arming the entire county's people with Mao Zedong Thought, they have gained the following insights:

1. **Grasp a firm attitude—towards Chairman Mao and towards Mao Zedong Thought.**

   After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, what should be grasped among the myriad of tasks? The county revolutionary committee conducted a study, criticism, and summary. That is, seriously study Vice Chairman Lin's high evaluation of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; severely criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who madly opposed Mao Zedong Thought; and summarize the experience of the proletarian revolutionary faction seizing power through Mao Zedong Thought.

   Grasping the attitude towards Chairman Mao means fighting head-on against a handful of capitalist roaders in everything. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders here shouted, "Everything must follow the first secretary of the county committee," and the county revolutionary committee countered with, "Everything must follow Chairman Mao!" In the past, capitalist roaders suppressed and opposed Chairman Mao's directives, and the county revolutionary committee countered with, "Implement Chairman Mao's directives, every second counts, and act decisively." After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the various levels of revolutionary committees disseminated the entire session's communiqué to every village and hamlet that very night. The next day, 11 out of 17 communes in the county held study classes on implementing the communiqué of the entire session.

   Grasping the attitude towards Chairman Mao means fighting the line struggle in everything. The cadres of this county, through practical struggle, gradually established a concept: at any time, in any work, Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line must be emphasized; any obstruction or wavering in thought must be raised to the height of the struggle between the two lines for recognition.

   Grasping the attitude towards Chairman Mao means deepening the broad masses of cadres and the people's boundless love for Chairman Mao's proletarian feelings. The various levels of revolutionary committees have extensively carried out activities throughout the county to enthusiastically praise the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, further enhancing the broad masses of cadres and the people's consciousness of consciously following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. More and more people in the county have achieved: hearing Chairman Mao's directives and taking action, noticing anything that does not conform to Chairman Mao's directives and changing it, and discovering anything that opposes Chairman Mao's directives and fighting it.

2. **Conduct one education—severe class struggle and two-line struggle education.**

   In the process of unifying the thinking of the entire county's people with Mao Zedong Thought, the various levels of revolutionary committees in this county have always conducted mass class education. They use methods such as recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness to make the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militia, and revolutionary cadres focus their new and old grievances on the number one capitalist roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and all class enemies. They deeply understand that this proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao "is completely necessary and very timely," thereby greatly enhancing the awareness of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In some places, after recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, every household wrote a "history of liberation" and kept an "account of blood and tears." They hung this "history and account" on both sides of the "treasure bookstand" in the main hall to educate their descendants to never forget class bitterness, never forget Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's kindness, and always follow Chairman Mao to make revolution.

   To unify the thinking of the entire county's people with Mao Zedong Thought, it is necessary to wage a battle of eliminating private interests and establishing public interests. In the activities of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, the various levels of revolutionary committees guided cadres and the masses to bring the problems of the two-line struggle in rural areas to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, to investigate the poison of revisionism, and to investigate the harm of "selfishness." The community members reflected: class education has uprooted the black roots of revisionism, planted red roots of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and firmly established the foundation for revolution to the end!

3. **Insist on one line—Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, directly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and launch mass movements.**

   After the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, through a period of practice, it was realized: revolution is to rely on Mao Zedong Thought from above and rely on revolutionary masses from below. Without the masses, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be learned well, cannot be implemented, and cannot be followed closely. The county revolutionary committee led the entire county's cadres to bring problems to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line, further criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the backwardness of the masses," and eliminated the poison of the fallacies spread by the capitalist roaders here, such as "the poor and lower-middle peasants do not listen, the grassroots cadres are ineffective," and "the secretary says, the masses follow." They consciously achieved: always remembering the poor and lower-middle peasants and directly relying on revolutionary masses in everything.

   This county launched mass movements, mainly focusing on two aspects: first, handing over Chairman Mao's directives to the masses in their entirety and mobilizing the masses; second, learning from the masses, discovering new things produced by the combination of Mao Zedong Thought and the pioneering spirit of the masses, immediately giving enthusiastic support, seriously summarizing, and widely promoting. Over the past year, the various levels of revolutionary committees in this county have strongly supported the pioneering spirit of the masses, established revolutionary models, and now there are 12 models at the county level, and 2,174 advanced units and individuals at the commune, brigade, and production team levels.

4. **Build a team—a team of cadres who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.**

   The revolutionary committee regards learning, propagating, implementing, and defending Chairman Mao's latest directives as their duty. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest directives are issued, from the main members of the county revolutionary committee to the members of the revolutionary production committees of the production teams, they all braved wind and rain, day and night, went deep into the masses, promptly propagated, and took the lead in implementing them. Many comrades often ran dozens of miles at night to quickly convey Chairman Mao's directives.

   The revolutionary committee often educates cadres that loyalty to Chairman Mao must mean fighting selfishness first, criticizing revisionism first, fighting the enemy in the forefront, and taking the lead in collective labor. In this regard, the leading group of the county revolutionary committee has set an example. In November last year, the county revolutionary committee sent a large number of cadres to the communes and brigades to labor and make revolution with the broad revolutionary masses. This year, after Chairman Mao's latest directives on cadres going down to labor were issued, except for those who stayed in the organs and the old, weak, and sick, all 500-plus cadres in the county were sent down to the production teams to labor within four days.

    贵州天柱县革委会带领全县人民在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作
    用伟大的毛泽东思想统一认识统一行动
    全县组织了毛泽东思想宣传队二千三百多个，拥有二万五千多名宣传员，建立了遍及城乡的强大宣传网，毛泽东思想空前大普及，全县面貌发生了巨大变化
    据新华社贵州十日电　贵州省天柱县革命委员会自一九六七年三月诞生以来，狠抓根本不转向，坚持用毛泽东思想统一全县人民的思想，使全县面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    天柱是贵州省一个边沿县，二十一万人口，百分之八十是侗族。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东思想在全县广大人民群众中得到了空前大普及。
    过去，这里的党内一小撮走资派秉承叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的意旨，疯狂地封锁毛主席的声音，竭力反对贫下中农读毛主席的书。贫下中农要得到一本毛主席的书，真比登天还难。现在，全县四万五千多户社员，家家都有一部《毛泽东选集》。全县组织了以贫下中农为主体、民兵为骨干的毛泽东思想宣传队二千三百多个，拥有二万五千多名宣传员，建立了遍及城乡各个角落的强大的毛泽东思想宣传网。许多背着娃娃的女社员，识字不多的小学生，白发苍苍的老贫农，也自动参加了宣传。全县二千二百四十五个生产队，分布在四千七百多平方公里的土地上，毛主席的最新指示一发表，只要二十多个小时，就能原原本本地同全体人民见面。
    广大贫下中农、民兵、革命干部以对毛主席忠不忠要看行动来自觉地要求自己。他们对毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号令，步步紧跟，坚决贯彻。
    广大贫下中农、民兵、革命干部把“读一辈子毛主席的书，做一辈子毛主席的好农民”化为自觉行动。人人坚持天天读毛主席的书，事事不离毛主席的教导。丰收时，他们首先想到毛主席，把成熟最早、质量最好的新谷交给国家。全县夏粮征购和秋粮征购都以空前的速度完成了任务，走在全省的最前面。广大社员热爱集体，人人争先进，个个比贡献。真是“人换思想地换装，天柱一片新气象！”
    天柱县各级革命委员会，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，用毛泽东思想武装全县人民，用毛泽东思想统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，保证了全县无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。他们在用毛泽东思想武装全县人民头脑的过程中，有这样几点体会：
    一、狠抓一个态度——对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度。
    革命委员会建立后千头万绪抓什么？县革委会进行了一学、二批、三总结。即认真学习林副主席对毛主席和毛泽东思想的崇高评价；狠批刘少奇等党内一小撮走资派疯狂反对毛泽东思想的反革命罪行；总结无产阶级革命派夺权靠毛泽东思想的经验。
    抓对毛主席的态度，就是要事事和一小撮走资派作针锋相对的斗争。过去这里的一小撮走资派叫嚣“一切要跟县委第一书记转”，县革委会就针锋相对地提出“一切紧跟毛主席！”过去走资派对毛主席的指示横加扣压、反对，县革委会就针锋相对地提出：贯彻毛主席指示，分秒必争，雷厉风行。党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，各级革委会当晚就把全会公报传遍每个村寨。第二天，全县十七个公社就有十一个公社办起了学习、贯彻全会公报的毛泽东思想学习班。
    抓对毛主席的态度，就要事事抓两条路线的斗争。这个县的干部在斗争实践中，逐步树立了一个观念：在任何时候，做任何工作，都要突出毛泽东思想，突出毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；遇到思想上任何一点阻碍和动摇，都要提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识。
    抓对毛主席的态度，就要加深广大干部、群众无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级感情。各级革委会在全县广泛开展了热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席，热烈颂扬毛泽东思想，热烈颂扬毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的活动，进一步提高了广大干部、群众紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的自觉性。全县越来越多的人做到：听见毛主席的指示就动，察觉不合毛主席指示的就改，发现反对毛主席指示的就斗。
    二、贯穿一个教育——狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育。
    这个县各级革命委员会，在用毛泽东思想统一全县人民思想的过程中，始终贯穿着群众性的阶级教育。他们采取忆苦思甜等方法，使广大贫下中农、民兵、革命干部把新仇旧恨集中到党内头号走资派刘少奇及一切阶级敌人身上，深刻认识毛主席领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命“是完全必要的，是非常及时的”，因而大大提高了捍卫毛主席革命路线的觉悟。有些地方贫下中农经过忆苦思甜，家家户户写了
  “翻身史”，记了“血泪账”。他们把这“一史一账”挂在堂屋中“宝书台”的两边，教育子孙万代永远不忘阶级苦，永远不忘毛主席、共产党的恩情，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
    用毛泽东思想统一全县人民的思想，必须进行破私立公的战斗。在忆苦思甜活动中，各级革命委员会都引导干部、群众带着农村两条道路斗争中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，查修正主义的流毒，查“私”字的危害。社员们反映：阶级教育，刨出了修正主义黑根，扎下了忠于毛主席的红根，坚定了革命到底的脚跟！
    三、坚持一条路线——毛主席的革命路线，直接依靠贫下中农，大搞群众运动。
    县革命委员会建立后，经过一段实践，认识到：革命，就是要上靠毛泽东思想，下靠革命群众。离开了群众，毛泽东思想就学不好，用不上，跟不紧。县革委会领导全县干部带着问题，学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导，进一步批判刘少奇的“群众落后论”，肃清这里的走资派散布的“贫下中农不听话，基层干部不得力”、“书记说了算，群众照着办”的谬论的流毒，自觉地做到：念念不忘贫下中农，事事直接依靠革命群众。
    这个县大搞群众运动，主要抓两条：一是把毛主席的指示原原本本交给群众，放手发动群众；二是向群众学习，发现毛泽东思想与群众首创精神相结合而产生的新事物，立即热情支持，认真总结，大力推广。一年多来，这个县各级革委会大力支持群众首创精神，树立革命典型，现在被树为县一级的典型有十二个，公社、大队和生产队的先进单位和个人二千一百七十四个。
    四、建设一支队伍——无限忠于毛主席的干部队伍。
    县革委会把学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛主席的最新指示作为自己的天职。每当毛主席的最新指示发表，从县革委会主任到生产队革命生产委员会成员，都风雨无阻，不分昼夜，深入群众，及时宣传，带头贯彻。许多同志常常为了迅速传达毛主席的指示，连夜奔跑几十里路。
    县革委会经常教育干部，忠于毛主席就必须斗私斗在前，批修批在先，对敌斗争打冲锋，集体劳动带头干。在这方面，县革委会领导班子作出了榜样。去年十一月，县革委会把大批干部下放到社队去，和广大革命群众一道劳动，一道闹革命。今年，毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示发表后，除留在机关工作的同志和老弱病残者以外，全县其余五百个干部四天内就全部下放到生产队劳动。
    由于这个县的多数干部用自己活学活用毛泽东思想的模范行动带领群众前进，获得了广大群众的信任。广大群众说：“过去有些干部是‘观察员’‘评论员’‘大官员’，现在干部是战斗员，宣传员，勤务员。”
