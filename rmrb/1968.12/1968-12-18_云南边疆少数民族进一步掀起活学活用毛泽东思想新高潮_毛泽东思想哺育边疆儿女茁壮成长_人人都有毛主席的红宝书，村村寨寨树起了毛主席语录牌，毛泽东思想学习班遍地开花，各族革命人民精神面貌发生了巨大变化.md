The revolutionary people of more than 20 ethnic minorities in the border regions of Yunnan Province, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, are currently launching a new wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of various ethnic groups in the border regions of Yunnan exposed the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Yunnan who had blocked Chairman Mao's voice and suppressed the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. As a result, the great Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized. Currently, from the Wumeng Mountains to the banks of the Red River, from the banks of the Jinsha River to the dense forests of Xishuangbanna, the revolutionary people of various ethnic minorities all possess Chairman Mao's Little Red Book. Every village and hamlet has erected Mao Zedong Thought quotation boards, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes are blooming everywhere. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is surging forward. On the mountains of Xishuangbanna, elderly Wa people in their fifties carry torches and follow mountain paths to night schools to study Mao Zedong Thought. On the banks of the Nu River, children of the Lisu ethnic group, around ten years old, slide across bamboo bridges to attend Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The revolutionary people of various ethnic groups follow Chairman Mao's advocacy of combining theory with practice, taking class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, and actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in real-life struggles. In Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, the 130,000 ethnic minority people living along a 600-kilometer border line have studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." In the first three quarters of this year, they held more than 8,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 190,000 participants. The more they study, the more they love Chairman Mao, the more they love Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In August, when a severe tornado hit Sanjia in Gongshan Dong Autonomous County, the impoverished farmers of the Lisu, Dong, and Nu ethnic groups, despite the disaster, tightly held onto wooden doors with Chairman Mao's portrait pasted on them, showing their profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. In the New Alliance Township of Zhongdian County, Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Tibetan impoverished farmers restored their cooperatives, which had been dismantled under Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line. The members, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, crossed snow-covered mountains, traversed bamboo bridges, and walked for days to distant places to purchase Chairman Mao's Little Red Book. In this cooperative, where ancestors had been slaves for five generations, a 76-year-old Tibetan elder, Wengji, received "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and was moved to tears. He looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and said, "Chairman Mao, I will forever follow you on the socialist path, forever follow you in revolution to the end!" After studying Chairman Mao's works, Wengji became clear-headed, full of energy, and led the youth to open 50 acres of terraced fields. He has now been selected as a county-level activist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has sparked an extremely enthusiastic response among the revolutionary people of various ethnic minorities in the border regions of Yunnan. They enthusiastically hail the plenary session's decision to expel the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and resolutely implement the great battle tasks proposed in the communiqué. Currently, the revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is forming a high tide among the revolutionary people of various ethnic groups.

The widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought has greatly facilitated the revolutionization of people's thinking. In the Menghan area, the emancipated slave Mi Yumi, during the Cultural Revolution, studied Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm and always cared for the collective, and was elected as a member of the county revolutionary committee by the masses. Her husband, with her help, also became an active participant in studying Chairman Mao's works.

    云南边疆少数民族进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想新高潮
    毛泽东思想哺育边疆儿女茁壮成长
    人人都有毛主席的红宝书，村村寨寨树起了毛主席语录牌，毛泽东思想学习班遍地开花，各族革命人民精神面貌发生了巨大变化
    据新华社昆明电　云南省边疆地区二十多个少数民族的革命人民，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，正在掀起一个活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，云南边疆地区各族人民清算了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在云南的代理人封锁毛主席的声音，遏制毛泽东思想的传播的滔天罪行，使伟大的毛泽东思想得到了空前大普及。目前，从乌蒙山区到红河两岸，从金沙江畔到西双版纳密林中，各少数民族革命人民人人都有毛主席的红宝书，村村寨寨树起了毛主席语录牌，毛泽东思想学习班遍地开花，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动波澜壮阔。在西盟山上，几十岁的佤族老人打着火把摸着山路进夜校学习毛泽东思想；在怒江岸边，十来岁的傈僳族儿童溜过竹索去进毛泽东思想学习班。各族革命人民遵循毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为纲，带着现实斗争中的各种问题活学活用毛泽东思想。在怒江傈僳族自治州，居住在六百多公里边境线上的十三万少数民族人民，学习了毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，今年头三个季度内办了八千多个毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达十九万多人次。他们越学越热爱毛主席，越学越热爱毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。今年八月间，贡山独龙族怒族自治县三区遇到一场特大的龙卷风，受灾的傈僳、独龙和怒族贫下中农，有的顾不上抢救亲人，却紧紧地抱住贴有毛主席画像的木门不放，对伟大领袖毛主席表现了无比深厚的无产阶级感情。迪庆藏族自治州中甸县新联乡的藏族贫下中农，在文化大革命中恢复了他们过去在刘少奇及其代理人推行的资产阶级反动路线下被砍掉的合作社。社员们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，翻雪山，跨溜索，走几天山路到外地购买毛主席的红宝书。这个社在旧社会祖辈五代是奴隶的七十六岁的藏族老人翁吉拿到《毛主席语录》后，激动得热泪盈眶，他深情地看着毛主席像说：“毛主席啊，我要永远跟着您走社会主义道路，永远跟着您革命到底！”翁吉老人学习了毛主席著作后，心明眼亮干劲足，带领青年们开了五十亩梯田。现在他已被选为县活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。
    党的八届十二中全会公报的发表，在云南边疆各少数民族革命人民中激起了极其热烈的反响。他们热烈欢呼全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党的英明决定，坚决落实公报提出的伟大战斗任务。目前，对刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判，正在各族革命人民中形成高潮。
    毛泽东思想的大普及，极大地促进了人的思想革命化。勐罕地区的翻身奴隶咪玉万，文化大革命中如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，处处关心集体，被群众选为县革委会委员。她的丈夫也在她的帮助下，成了学习毛主席著作的积极分子。
