Title: Guarding Against the Sugar-Coated Cannonballs in the Face of Victory

In the face of victory, it is much more difficult to consolidate achievements than to seize victory. Chairman Mao said: “Because of victory, arrogance, the tendency to consider oneself a hero, the tendency to stop and not seek progress, and the tendency to indulge in pleasures and not want to live a hard life may grow within the party.” These four tendencies are the new problems most likely to arise in the face of victory.

In our practice, we have come to understand that in the face of victory, one very important aspect of preventing revisionism is preventing arrogance. For example, when we formed a mutual aid team, the county awarded us a blue-lettered red flag. Everyone treasured it greatly and used it to spur themselves on. However, later, as we received more and more awards, people forgot about that flag, and even viewed new red flags as ordinary. The party branch believed that this was not just about a flag; it was about the growth of the “arrogance” in one's thoughts. It was not that the old flag had faded, but that revolutionary spirit had begun to fade. So, they took out the old flag and used it to educate everyone to overcome arrogance, the tendency to consider oneself a hero, the tendency to stop and not seek progress, and the tendency to indulge in pleasures and not want to live a hard life. Afterwards, whenever “arrogance” reared its head, the party branch comrades would tell the story of this flag to remind everyone to guard against and combat arrogance, to continue the revolution, and to keep moving forward.

Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch Liang Bianliang said: Chairman Mao taught us: “Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will come to cheer us on. ... There may be some communists who have never been defeated by armed enemies; they are truly heroes in the face of these enemies. But they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated cannonballs; they will be defeated in the face of sugar-coated bullets. We must prevent this situation.” For many years, we have followed Chairman Mao's words and focused on “prevention.”

One year, the party branch called back a rich peasant's son who had been insisting on a reactionary stance from the city to Da Zhai for reform. The next day, he sent a pack of cigarettes to Comrade Chen Yonggui. Yonggui knew it was the rich peasant's son who sent it, so he immediately had his child return the cigarettes to the rich peasant's family. At the dining hall meeting, Yonggui told everyone about the incident and asked for a discussion: “Should we smoke this cigarette?” Some said: “Tobacco and alcohol go together; let's smoke it!” Yonggui said: “Why, when we used to work for his family, didn't he even give us a pack of cigarettes? We used to smoke tree leaves as cigarettes. Now, we are officials, and he comes to our door with cigarettes? This is clearly an attempt to pull us down. Can we smoke this cigarette?” After the discussion, the poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously said: “This cigarette is poison; we must not smoke it!” Everyone immediately called the person who sent the cigarettes to the dining hall meeting and educated him one by one. The party branch used this incident as a living example, often telling and retelling it, to keep the cadres' minds clear. In this way, the un-reformed landlords and rich peasants were very afraid of us. Later, when we encountered attacks by sugar-coated cannonballs, we stood even firmer, unmoved and unshaken, and worked even better for the party.

### 在胜利面前  防止糖衣炮弹的攻击

    在胜利面前  防止糖衣炮弹的攻击
    大队长贾承让说：搞革命，巩固胜利成果比夺取胜利要困难得多。毛主席说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”毛主席说的这四种情绪，就是在胜利面前最容易产生的新问题。
    我们在实践中体会到，在胜利面前，防“修”的一个很重要方面就是防“骄”。比如，办互助组时，县里奖给我们一面蓝字红布旗，大家看得非常贵重，时时用这面奖旗来鞭策自己。可是后来，得到的奖旗越来越多了，人们就把那面旗子忘掉了，甚至对新得到的大红旗也看得很平常了。党支部认为，这不是对待一面旗子的问题，而是思想上生长了“骄”字。不是因为那面老旗子褪色了，而是人的革命思想开始褪色了。于是，就把那面老旗子拿出来，教育大家克服骄傲情绪，克服以功臣自居的情绪，克服停顿起来不求进步的情绪，克服贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪。以后，每当“骄”字抬头，党支部的同志就给大家讲这面旗子的故事，提醒大家防骄反骄，不断革命，永远前进。
    党支部副书记梁便良说：毛主席教导我们：“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。……可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”多年来，我们听毛主席的话，在“预防”两字上狠下功夫。
    有一年，党支部把一个坚持反动立场的富农子弟从城市叫回大寨改造。他头天回来，第二天一早，就给陈永贵同志送去一条香烟。永贵同志知道是富农儿子送来的，马上让自己的孩子把烟给这户富农送回去。饭场会上，永贵同志把送烟的事讲给大家听，让大家讨论：“这烟该不该吸”？有的说：“烟酒不分家，送去就吸了吧！”永贵同志说：“为什么过去咱给他家扛长工时，要袋烟都不给，咱采树叶当烟抽；如今，咱当了干部，他上门送烟？这分明是想拉咱们下水。这烟能吸吗？”经过讨论，贫下中农齐声说：“这香烟是毒烟，万万吸不得！”大家马上把这个送烟的人叫到饭场会上，你一句、我一句地教育了一顿。这件事，党支部作为活教材，经常讲，反复讲，使干部保持清醒的头脑。这样，没改造好的地富分子很害怕我们。以后，我们再遇到糖衣炮弹袭击时，也就站得更稳，身不动，膀不摇，更好地为党工作。
