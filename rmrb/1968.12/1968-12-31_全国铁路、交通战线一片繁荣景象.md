Under the close care of our great leader Chairman Mao, and amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers on China's railway and transportation fronts have hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have put proletarian politics in command, taken class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key link, earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the various resolutions of the National Railway and Transportation Conference personally approved by Chairman Mao, launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and promoted a great development in transportation production, thus powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural production.

Since this year, good news has been pouring in from the railway and transportation fronts across the country. The volume of freight and passenger transportation has been rising month by month. By the end of December, the daily freight car loading volume of railways nationwide has already surpassed that of the same period last year by more than one fold. The three shipping areas, fifteen coastal ports, and two ocean shipping companies under the Ministry of Communications have, for the most part, completed their 1968 transportation plans ahead of schedule and overfulfilled them. The total shipping volume and the total port throughput have far exceeded those of 1967, with many units achieving or surpassing their historical highest levels. Now, from the vast seas of China to every river port, from the major railways that traverse the country to the highways that extend to remote rural areas, everywhere presents a thriving scene. Ships, trains, trucks, and vessels loaded with industrial and agricultural production materials and daily necessities for the people are coming and going like shuttles, ceaselessly flowing. The excellent situation of a new leap in China's socialist construction is already fully displayed on the busy transportation lines.

Our great leader Chairman Mao attaches great importance to the revolution and production on the railway and transportation fronts. In March of this year, Chairman Mao personally approved the convening of the National Railway and Transportation Conference. During the conference, Chairman Mao received all the representatives attending the conference, which greatly encouraged and educated the revolutionary workers on the railway and transportation fronts nationwide. After the conference, the broad revolutionary workers, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely carried out the resolutions of the National Railway and Transportation Conference, grasped the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. They quickly realized revolutionary great unity, generally established revolutionary committees, and earnestly carried out the work of cleaning up class ranks, striking hard at a handful of class enemies, and thus brought about a new look in railway and transportation.

Since this year, the revolutionary workers in the railway and transportation departments across the country have generally launched the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. They have thoroughly criticized and repudiated many unreasonable rules and regulations, thus creating extremely favorable conditions for the great development of transportation production. The railway workers across the country have criticized and repudiated the revisionist black goods of "controlling, blocking, and oppressing" workers advocated by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents. As a result, the number of locomotives loaded beyond the axle weight limit has been increasing, and this alone has enabled an average of 280,000 tons of additional cargo to be transported daily in the fourth quarter of this year, equivalent to opening 90 more trains for the country. The revolutionary workers in the shipping and road transportation sectors have also broken through many unreasonable old frameworks, promoting a continuous increase in transportation volume and creating many new miracles. In June of this year, some ordinary sailors of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau, with the help of Yangtze River pilots, for the first time navigated a 10,000-ton giant ship into the Yangtze River and successfully reached Hankou. Since then, six more 10,000-ton giant ships have entered the Yangtze River. The crew of the "Battle 59" ship of this bureau changed the old practice of "sailors only driving the ship, not repairing it." They repaired the ship that was originally planned to be sent to the factory for overhaul by themselves, completing the entire repair task in just 14 days and achieving success on the first trial run. After this experience was promoted in various shipping areas, tens of thousands of tons of shipping capacity were added for the country in just the second half of the year.

Recently, with the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the railway and transportation departments across the country are also promoting a new mode of transportation—joint transportation. This joint transportation integrates the originally separate and decentralized management of railways, shipping, highways, and short-distance transportation, forming a red transportation line, tapping transportation potential, and supporting industrial and agricultural production.

### 全国铁路、交通战线一片繁荣景象

    沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进
    全国铁路、交通战线一片繁荣景象
    广大革命职工认真落实毛主席亲自批准的全国铁路、交通会议的各项决议，狠抓革命，猛促生产，货运和客运量逐月直线上升，并正在推行联合运输，有力地支援了工农业生产
    新华社三十日讯　在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国铁路、交通战线上的广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为纲，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示和毛主席亲自批准的全国铁路、交通会议的各项决议，掀起斗、批、改高潮，促进了运输生产的大发展，有力地支援了工农业生产。
    今年以来，全国铁路、交通战线上捷报频传，货运和客运量逐月直线上升。到十二月底，全国铁路每天装车量已经超过去年同期一倍以上。交通部所属的三个航区、沿海十五个港口和两个远洋运输分公司，绝大多数都提前超额完成了一九六八年的运输计划，船舶的运输总量和港口吞吐总量大大超过了一九六七年，其中不少单位的运输生产达到或超过了历史最高水平。现在，从我国辽阔的海洋到每条内河港汊，从纵贯全国的铁路大动脉到伸向偏僻农村的公路，到处呈现一派兴旺景象，满载着工农业生产资料和人民生活用品的轮船、火车、汽车、船舶往来如梭，川流不息。我国社会主义建设新飞跃的大好形势，从繁忙的交通运输线上已经充分显示出来。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席十分关怀铁路、交通战线上的革命和生产。今年三月，毛主席亲自批准了召开全国铁路、交通会议。会议期间，毛主席接见了出席会议的全体代表，给了全国铁路、交通战线上的革命职工极大的鼓舞和教育。会后，广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行全国铁路、交通会议的决议，狠抓革命，猛促生产，迅速实现了革命的大联合，普遍建立了革命委员会，并且认真进行了清理阶级队伍的工作，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人，铁路交通运输出现了新面貌。
    今年以来，各地铁路交通部门的广大革命职工，普遍开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大破不合理的规章制度，也为运输生产的大发展创造了极为有利的条件。全国铁路职工大破叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行的“管、卡、压”工人的修正主义黑货，使得满载超轴的机车越来越多，仅这一项，今年第四季度平均每天就多运了二十八万吨货物，等于为国家多开了九十列火车。船舶和公路运输方面的广大革命职工，也由于破除了许多不合理的旧框框，促使运输量不断上升，并创造出不少新的奇迹。今年六月，上海海运局的一些普通船员，在长江引水员的帮助下，第一次把一艘万吨巨轮开进了长江，顺利地到达了汉口。从此以后，又有六艘万吨巨轮开进了长江。这个局的“战斗五九号”轮的船员，改变了过去“船员只管开船，不管修船”的陈规旧习，把原来准备进厂检修的轮船改成自己动手修理，结果只用了十四天就完成了全部修理任务，而且做到一次试车成功。这项经验在各航区推广以后，仅下半年就为国家增加了几十万吨运力。
    最近，随着斗、批、改的深入发展，各地铁路交通运输部门还正在推行一种崭新的运输方式——联合运输。这种联合运输把原来各自为政、分散经管的铁路、航运、公路、短途运输等各个部门，紧密联结起来，组成了一条红色运输线，挖掘了运输潜力，支援了工农业生产。
