The benefits of having factories manage urban primary schools are something we have experienced firsthand.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, our Chuzhou County Third-Eight Textile Mill recently took over the experimental primary school near our factory. Practice has proven that this is the key to thoroughly carrying out the educational revolution in cities. Its advantages are:

1. It ensures that cultural power is firmly in the hands of the working class. Before the Cultural Revolution, factories and schools were like "water buffalo horns and yellow cow horns, each to their own." After the Cultural Revolution, many schools invited workers to give lectures, asking the working class to take the lead, but this was still a matter of "invitation," nominally accepting the leadership of the working class, but in reality, the actual power in schools was not in the hands of the working class. By handing over public schools to factories to manage, the working class can directly lead schools politically, ideologically, economically, and organizationally, truly grasping cultural power firmly in their own hands.

2. It can genuinely implement Chairman Mao's educational policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," which is beneficial for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. In the past, the revisionist educational line taught students to "hear nothing outside the window, focus only on reading the classics," to "plant crops on the blackboard" and "operate machines on the blackboard," severely alienating them from proletarian politics, the masses, and production reality. Factories managing schools allow the working class to reform old schools, educational systems, and teaching content according to Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary line, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and in the midst of the three great revolutionary struggles, cultivating students to "become socialist-conscious, cultured laborers."

3. It is beneficial for the re-education of intellectuals and promoting the thought revolution among teachers. Factories managing schools allow teachers and workers to criticize and repudiate revisionism together, labor together, and teach together. The working class can see, touch, and hear the teachers' thoughts and actions, providing timely and effective criticism and education.

Regarding several specific issues in "factory-managed schools," we have solved them as follows:

1. Leadership issue. Under the unified leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, we established an educational revolutionary leadership group composed mainly of the working class (nine members, five workers, three revolutionary teachers, and one student). This group is responsible for leading all struggle, criticism, and transformation work in the school, carrying out the educational revolution.

2. Education and labor arrangement issue. Teachers and students participate in various production labors in the factory according to their age characteristics. Initially, to ensure that production is not affected, we prepared a few looms for teachers and students to practice, gradually increasing the number of machines and expanding production. Workers also teach Mao Zedong Thought study guidance courses, as well as classes on class struggle, production struggle, and military and physical education in the school.

3. Financial issue. The factory is responsible for educational funds and does not ask the state for money. The Third-Eight Textile Mill bears over ten thousand yuan in teachers' salaries each year, which will not affect the factory's normal accumulation.

### 工人阶级领导学校的好形式

    工人阶级领导学校的好形式
    对城市小学归工厂办的好处，我们有自己的实际体会。
    在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，我们滁县三八布厂最近接管了我们工厂附近的实验小学。实践证明，这是彻底搞好城市教育革命的关键。它的好处是：
    一、能够保证文权牢牢掌握在工人阶级自己的手里。文化大革命前，工厂和学校是“水牛角，黄牛角，各归各”。文化大革命后，许多学校到工厂请工人去讲课，要求工人阶级进行领导，但这毕竟还是“请”，名之曰接受工人阶级领导，事实上学校的实权不在工人阶级手中。把公办学校交给工厂来办，工人阶级就可以直接从政治上、思想上、经济上、组织上对学校实行全面领导，真正把文权牢牢地掌握在自己手中。
    二、能够切实地贯彻毛主席提出的“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教育方针，有利于培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。过去修正主义教育路线，教育学生“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”，在黑板上种“庄稼”，在黑板上开“机器”，严重地脱离无产阶级政治，脱离群众，脱离生产实际。工厂办学校，工人阶级就能按照毛主席的教育革命路线来改造旧的学校，改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学内容，用毛泽东思想来统帅一切，在三大革命斗争当中，把学生培养“成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    三、有利于对知识分子再教育，促进教师思想革命化。工厂办学校，教师和工人斗私批修在一起，劳动在一起，教学在一起，工人阶级对他们的思想、言行看得见，摸得着，听得到，批评对症，教育及时。
    对于“以厂管校”中的几个具体问题，我们是这样解决的：
    一、领导问题。在工厂革委会统一领导下，成立了以工人阶级为主体的教育革命领导小组（九人组成，工人五人，革命教师三人，学生一人），由这个小组负责领导学校中的全部斗、批、改工作，搞好教育革命。
    二、教育和劳动安排问题。教师学生根据年龄特点的不同，每周轮流参加工厂各项生产劳动。开始，为了保证生产不受影响，我们准备了少数布机给师生们练习，以后逐步增加机器，扩大生产。工人也分别在学校担任毛泽东思想学习辅导课，以及阶级斗争、生产斗争、军事体育课。
    三、财权问题。教育经费由工厂负责，不向国家要钱。三八布厂每年负担一万多元的教师工资，不会影响厂里的正常积累。
