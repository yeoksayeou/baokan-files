The revolutionary workers of the Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They completed the year's production plan for crude oil and other main products 31 days ahead of schedule.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of petroleum workers in the Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and launched a great mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, taken the work team as the starting point, and persistently carried out a revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. At the same time, they have vigorously carried out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, streamlined the organization, transferred office personnel, and reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, which has effectively promoted the development of production. In particular, oil extraction workers and well repair workers, through investigation and research, mutual cooperation, and overcoming numerous difficulties, have revived many oil wells that were deemed "abandoned wells" by bourgeois reactionary "authorities." Many of the revived wells can even flow spontaneously. They have also drilled new wells in areas deemed "oil-free" by bourgeois reactionary "authorities," and these new wells produce oil very well. Since this year, crude oil production has exceeded the monthly plan every month. Gasoline, kerosene, and other main products have also completed the annual plan ahead of schedule.

    玉门石油管理局原油生产计划月月超额完成
    玉门石油管理局的革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，提前三十一天完成了今年原油生产等主要产品的生产计划。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，玉门石油管理局广大石油工人紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，以班组为基点，坚持深入开展革命的大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，同时狠抓了清理阶级队伍工作，精简了机构，下放了科室人员，改革了不合理的规章制度，有力地推动了生产的发展。特别是采油工人和修井工人通过调查研究，互相协作，克服了重重困难，复活了许多被资产阶级反动技术“权威”判为“报废井”的油井，不少复活井还能自喷。他们还在被资产阶级反动技术“权威”定为无油的地区钻出了出油很好的新井。今年以来原油生产月月超额完成。汽油、煤油等主要产品也都提前完成了年计划。
