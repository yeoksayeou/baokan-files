Six thousand people in Northern Ireland's Armagh City held a massive demonstration on November 30, demanding democratic rights.

The demonstrators gathered in the city center for a rally and then marched in a procession. The reactionary authorities dispatched about four hundred police officers to obstruct the march, and they brutally beat the crowd with batons. The demonstrators, undeterred by the violence, fought back with stones and bottles. Some demonstrators were unlawfully arrested.

Armagh City is approximately eighty kilometers from Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland.
