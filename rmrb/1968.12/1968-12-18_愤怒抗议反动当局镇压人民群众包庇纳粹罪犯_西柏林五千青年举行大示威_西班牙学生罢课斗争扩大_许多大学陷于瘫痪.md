New York Times, Bonn, December 14 — West Berlin: About 5,000 young people and residents of West Berlin held a demonstration in the city center on the afternoon of the 14th, strongly protesting the reactionary authorities' use of state machinery to suppress the people and shield the blood-stained Nazi criminals.

The demonstrators continuously chanted slogans such as "Nazis get out!" condemning the reactionary authorities' shielding of Nazi criminals. They marched towards the West Berlin City Hall and the West Berlin Court.

In front of the City Hall, the demonstrators held a rally. Speakers at the rally exposed how the West Berlin authorities use the court, a tool of bourgeois dictatorship, to intensify the suppression of the people, while shielding and protecting Nazi murderers. They also called on the people to unite and engage in "collective resistance."

Because of her hatred for the Nazis, a young woman named Beate Klarsfeld slapped West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. At the rally, she denounced the West German judicial system's persecution of her, saying: "For slapping someone, I have to go to jail for a year, while the murderers of Jews don't even have to spend ten minutes in jail."

The West Berlin authorities were frightened by the powerful demonstration and hastily dispatched a large number of police and mounted police to suppress the crowd. However, the demonstrators, fearing no violence, retaliated bravely with smoke bombs, paint bags, and rotten eggs.

	The workers and students in Spain are bravely continuing their struggle against capitalist exploitation and the reactionary education system.

	In the coal-mining province of Asturias, 5,000 miners are continuing their strike, protesting against the capitalists' ruthless exploitation of miners and demanding improved conditions for miners suffering from silicosis. The Spanish students' strike, which has been going on for nine days, is expanding. The Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Political Science, and the Faculty of Economics at the University of Valencia have been closed due to student strikes. The strike has almost paralyzed all universities and colleges.

    新华社波恩十四日电  西柏林消息：西柏林约五千名青年和居民十四日下午在市中心举行示威游行，强烈抗议反动当局利用国家机器镇压人民群众，包庇血债累累的纳粹分子的罪恶行径。
    示威群众不断高呼“纳粹滚蛋！”等谴责反动当局包庇纳粹分子的口号，浩浩荡荡地向西柏林市政厅和西柏林法院挺进。
    在市政厅门前，示威群众举行了大会。会上发言的人纷纷揭露西柏林当局利用法庭这个资产阶级专政工具来加紧镇压人民群众，而对纳粹杀人犯却百般包庇、保护的罪行，并且号召人民团结起来进行“集体的反抗”。
    由于仇视纳粹分子曾经打了西德总理基辛格一记耳光的女青年比特·克拉斯费尔特，在大会上控诉西德司法机构对她的迫害说：“打了一个耳光就要坐牢一年，而屠杀犹太人的凶手却连十分钟的牢也不坐。”
    西柏林当局被群众的强大示威吓破了胆，慌忙派出大批警察和马队镇压群众。但是示威群众不畏强暴，纷纷用烟幕弹、油漆袋和臭鸡蛋等为武器，英勇进行反击。
    本报讯　西班牙工人、学生英勇地坚持反对资本主义剥削和反动教育制度的斗争。
    在产煤的阿斯图里亚省，有五千名矿工继续进行罢工，抗议资本家不顾矿工死活、残酷地剥削矿工的行径，要求改善患矽肺病的矿工的条件。已经坚持九天的西班牙学生罢课斗争正在扩大。巴伦西亚大学的文理学院、政治科学院和经济学院因学生罢课而关闭。罢课斗争差不多使所有的大学学院都处于瘫痪状态。
