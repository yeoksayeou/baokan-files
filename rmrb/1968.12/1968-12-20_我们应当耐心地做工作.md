We Should Patiently Do Our Work

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team Stationed at Fudan University, Xīn Zhìhǎi

The term "repeatedly" has been frequently encountered during the Cultural Revolution.

After our Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the superstructure domain, we encountered another form of "repeatedly." This "repeatedly" is a manifestation of the vacillation of the petty-bourgeoisie, and it is also a common ailment among intellectuals. Among intellectuals, this "repeatedly" is quite prevalent. In terms of stance, viewpoint, thought, and emotion, they often experience fluctuations. Today, they might understand something, but after sleeping, they might not understand it the next day; now they understand, but after meeting a few like-minded individuals, they might not understand anymore; they might understand one issue, but not another. Thus, they oscillate between understanding and not understanding, back and forth. In terms of time, there are short fluctuations, which can occur within a day, two days, or even within a meal or a minute. Long fluctuations can last for ten days, twenty days, or even several months. These fluctuations, while seemingly strange, are not so strange. Some intellectuals, although they have read a few books, have not rooted themselves among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their thoughts are actually quite empty. They have not experienced storms or seen the world, and they carry subjective and individualistic tendencies. Therefore, when they encounter difficulties, it is natural for them to waver.

How should our Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team deal with this "repeatedly" among intellectuals? We should confront it head-on. We should also repeatedly educate them on their thoughts, making them steadfast.

When intellectuals fluctuate on issues of stance and line, we should follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." We repeatedly educate them on the history of the struggle between the two lines, making them firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and on the side of the working class.

In their work, intellectuals also experience "repeatedly." Today, they might achieve some results and be full of enthusiasm, but tomorrow, when they encounter setbacks, they become like a deflated balloon. Their approach to revolutionary criticism is the same. Initially, they are very enthusiastic, but over time, they become sluggish. In the process of ideological transformation, today they might accept the proletarian worldview education of the working class, their confidence soars, and they declare that they will definitely make up their minds to overcome their petty-bourgeois thoughts. However, when the revolution truly touches them, they will feel "pain," "unable to bear it." They might even think that some aspects of themselves are "quite good." After attending a class on class education, they might be moved to tears, but after a short while, they become "moved when listening, excited when thinking, but unwilling to act when returning." Seeing these fluctuations, we repeatedly educate them with Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying the revolution through to the end," making them not become half-hearted revolutionaries.

Intellectuals have many fluctuations. Today, one fluctuation might be resolved, but tomorrow, new fluctuations will arise. Regarding this weakness of intellectuals, the working class has made up its mind to long-term, enthusiastic, and repeated help, education, and transformation of them. The thorough change of worldview requires a long time. We should patiently do our work and not be impatient. We believe that the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely transform those intellectuals who want revolution into intellectuals welcomed by us workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    我们应当耐心地做工作
    驻复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队　辛志海
    “反复”这二个字，我们在文化大革命中遇到很多。
    在我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑领域后，又遇到了一种“反复”。这种“反复”是小资产阶级摇摆性的表现，也是知识分子的通病。在知识分子中，这种“反复”的表现是很多的，他们在立场、观点、思想、感情各方面，经常会发生反复。今天想通了，睡了一觉，第二天又不通了；现在通了，碰到几个“气味”相投的，一串连又不通了；在这个问题上通了，在那个问题上又不通了。就这样，一会儿通，一会儿不通，反反复复。从时间上讲，有短的反复，一天、两天以至一顿饭、一分钟之内都会有。长的反复，十天、二十天以至数月。这些反复，说怪也不怪，有些知识分子虽然读了几本书，可是没有扎根到工农兵中去，他们的思想其实是很空虚的。他们没有经过风雨、见过世面，身上又带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，因此，一遇风浪，就很自然地会摇摆不定。
    针对知识分子的这种“反复”，我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队该怎么办呢？针锋相对。我们也应该反复地对他们进行思想教育，使他们坚定起来。
    知识分子在立场、路线问题上有“反复”时，我们就按照毛主席的指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”我们反复地对他们进行两条路线斗争史的教育，使他们坚定地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，站到工人阶级一边。
    在工作中，知识分子也有“反复”，今天工作有了点成绩，劲头就鼓得十足，明天碰到了挫折，就象泄了气的皮球。对待革命大批判也是这样，开始时干劲很大，时间一长又疲沓了。在思想改造过程中，今天接受了工人阶级的无产阶级的世界观的教育，信心倍增，表示一定要痛下决心，克服自己的小资产阶级思想。可是，当革命真正革到他自己的时候，就会感到“痛苦”，“受不了”。甚至认为自己有些方面还是“满不错的”。上了一堂阶级教育课，便热泪盈眶，感动万分，可是，事隔不久，就变成“听听很感动，想想很激动，回去就不想动”。看到了这些“反复”，我们就用毛主席“将革命进行到底”的教导反复地教育他们，使他们不做半截子的革命派。
    知识分子的反复是很多的，今天这个“反复”解决了，明天还会有新的“反复”。对于知识分子这个弱点，我们工人阶级下定决心，长期地、热情地、反复地帮助、教育、改造他们，世界观的彻底改变需要一个很长的时间，我们应当耐心地做工作，不能急躁。我们相信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，一定能把那些要革命的知识分子改造成为我们工农兵所欢迎的知识分子。
