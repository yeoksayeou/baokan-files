The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the place where the red sun rises. The red sun rises over Shaoshan, and its light shines across the five continents and four seas. Shaoshan, the place where our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao was born, is the brightest red sun in our hearts. The sun rises in the east, and its rays shine brightly. The heroic people of Shaoshan grew up in the place where the red sun rises; the brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought guides their path forward.

During the long years of struggle before liberation, the heroic people of Shaoshan drew boundless strength and confidence in victory from the great teachings of Chairman Mao. After liberation, in the high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction, they resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions and achieved one great victory after another. In the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they elevated the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level. Decades of revolutionary struggle have instilled in them a firm conviction: mastering Mao Zedong Thought means being able to overcome all difficulties, and following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line means victory!

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line guides the people of Shaoshan forward.

Shaoshan is a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. Every place where Chairman Mao once lived and carried out revolutionary activities is a classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Thousands of people from all over the country come here to study the great Mao Zedong Thought; the people of Shaoshan, whether they are former members of the peasant associations, self-defense corps, or the vigorous revolutionary youngsters, all cherish deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. They persist in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two lines. They firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and have engaged in a head-on struggle against the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's reactionary bourgeois line.

In 1961 and 1962, the traitor Liu Shaoqi sent his henchmen to Shaoshan to carry out so-called "work-study" sessions, vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "three autonomies and one contract," attempting to restore capitalism and defile this revolutionary holy land. At this critical moment, the people of Shaoshan remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." They repeatedly visited Chairman Mao's former residence and studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "Only socialism can save China," "The socialist road is the only road for China's agriculture," "The people's commune is good." The people of Shaoshan drew boundless strength from Chairman Mao's great teachings. They raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a resolute struggle against Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. A small group of capitalist-roaders in the locality argued and shouted, taking out their abacuses to calculate. The heroic people of Shaoshan said: "Put away your abacuses! The advanced cooperative is better than the elementary cooperative, and the people's commune is better than the advanced cooperative! The great leader Chairman Mao leads us on the socialist road, and we will definitely walk this road to the end!" In this way, they resolutely rejected all capitalist black goods. The capitalist-roaders were at a loss and scolded them for being "disobedient." They angrily replied: "We will resist capitalist things; we will not listen to the black words that tell us to take the capitalist road!" They resolutely followed the people's commune road indicated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly smashing Liu Shaoqi's evil plot to restore capitalism.

The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, is in full swing. The heroic people of Shaoshan actively responded to Chairman Mao's great battle call to "bombard the headquarters," raised high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, engaging in a tenacious struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hunan. They braved the winds and waves, rising up to criticize Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. In the mountains and fields, they set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere, achieving one victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the great leader Chairman Mao called for "holding study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," the entire commune quickly set up over 360 study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, with over 20,000 participants, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high. The heroic people of Shaoshan said: "The revolutionary flames of Shaoshan were personally ignited by Chairman Mao. We followed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, overthrew the three great mountains oppressing us, and gained liberation. After liberation, we continued to follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, quickly taking the broad road of socialist collectivization. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline. We will study Chairman Mao's books for life and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life."

Eagerly spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought

Shaoshan is a revolutionary holy land. Revolutionary people from all over the country and international friends from the five continents come here in batches to visit and pay their respects. The heroic people of Shaoshan regard spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionary people from all over the country and international friends from all over the world as their most glorious task. The over sixty-year-old revolutionary elder Mao Qianji guards Chairman Mao's former residence day and night, enthusiastically spreading the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses and foreign friends who come to visit. He said: "Although I am old, as long as I live, I will insist on spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought for a day and singing the praises of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for a day!"

Shaoshan and revolutionary people from all over the country strive to make Shaoshan a great classroom for spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought, demanding that the revolutionary holy land of Shaoshan be well built. However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hunan fear the construction of Shaoshan to death and try every means to obstruct and sabotage it. The heroic people of Shaoshan, who are loyal to Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary workers working in Shaoshan, with their hearts turned towards Chairman Mao, have fought against a small group of class enemies time and time again. The former members of the peasant associations, self-defense corps, and children's corps, as well as countless revolutionary youngsters, come in batches to the places where Chairman Mao carried out revolutionary activities, expressing their determination and loyalty to Chairman Mao, providing materials for the construction of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activity memorial sites. The revolutionary workers working in Shaoshan, with their boundless love for Chairman Mao, also actively participate in the construction of Shaoshan, enthusiastically spreading Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary workers of the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence have gone deep into the countryside, collecting a large amount of revolutionary historical materials. Shaoshan is welcoming guests from all directions with a new look every day.

Following the example of Dazhai, building Shaoshan into a prosperous socialist new countryside

The heroic sons and daughters of Shaoshan resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," taking Dazhai as an example, relying on their own efforts, and working hard to build Shaoshan into a socialist new countryside like Dazhai. However, before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hunan did everything they could to obstruct and sabotage the mass movement of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture" carried out by the people of Shaoshan. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Shaoshan angrily exposed and criticized the evil plots of a small group of class enemies, and more seriously learned from Dazhai. They set up study classes on Mao Zedong Thought with the focus on implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "learning from Dazhai in agriculture," comparing themselves with Dazhai, finding gaps, and taking measures to build Shaoshan even better.

In the activity of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan firmly grasp the root of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously emphasize proletarian politics, and promote the thought revolution of the people. They use the "Three Articles" as weapons to criticize and repudiate private thoughts, break private thoughts and establish public thoughts, firmly establishing the thought of working for the revolution and working for the public. The broad masses of community members work hard, selflessly, love the collective, and love the country, which has become a prevailing trend.

"Look at the waves of rice and millet, and heroes are everywhere in the evening smoke." Now, more than 80% of the farmland in Shaoshan Commune has achieved drought and flood resistance. Before liberation, only one crop of rice was planted here, and now the area of double-cropping rice accounts for more than 90%. Last year, the average yield per acre of grain increased from 500 jin before the commune was established to 915 jin. This year, although it suffered from a rare flood disaster in decades, grain was still harvested. After completing the grain procurement task, the entire commune voluntarily sold an additional 300,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. At present, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members are making all preparations to achieve greater revolutionary and production achievements next year.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The experience of history is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be constantly spoken, repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people, it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The heroic people of Shaoshan have extensively and deeply carried out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, enthusiastically praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, powerfully promoting the rapid development of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In this unprecedented good situation, the heroic people of Shaoshan resolutely declare that they will definitely take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, turning the place where the red sun rises—Shaoshan—into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着红太阳升起的地方
    韶山升起红太阳，五洲四海全照亮。
    韶山，是我们心中最红的红太阳、我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席诞生的地方。红日东升，光芒万丈。英雄的韶山儿女，生长在红太阳升起的地方；毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，照耀着他们前进的方向。
    在解放前那漫长的战斗岁月里，英雄的韶山儿女从毛主席的伟大教导里获得了无穷的力量和胜利的信心。解放以后，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设高潮中，他们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动提高到一个崭新的阶段。几十年革命斗争的经历使他们建立起了一个坚强的信念：掌握了毛泽东思想就能战胜一切，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进，就是胜利！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    指引着韶山人民的前进方向
    韶山是一所红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。毛主席的旧居和毛主席当年从事革命活动的每一处旧址，都是人们学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。千百万人从全国各地来到这里学习伟大的毛泽东思想；韶山的人们，无论是当年的农民协会会员、自卫队员，还是朝气蓬勃的革命小将，都怀着对伟大领袖毛主席最深厚的无产阶级感情，坚持在两条路线的斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想。他们坚定不移地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    一九六一年和一九六二年，叛徒刘少奇两次派他的黑爪牙到韶山搞所谓“蹲点”，拚命推行“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货，妄图复辟资本主义，玷污韶山这个革命圣地。在这严峻的时刻，韶山儿女牢记毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，一次又一次地来到毛主席旧居，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“只有社会主义能够救中国”“社会主义的道路是我国农业唯一的道路”“人民公社好”。韶山儿女从毛主席的伟大教导里，吸取了无穷无尽的力量。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线展开了坚决的斗争。当地的一小撮走资派吵吵嚷嚷，拿起算盘来算账。英雄的韶山儿女说：“收起你的算盘！高级社比初级社好，人民公社比高级社好！伟大领袖毛主席领导我们走社会主义道路，我们走定了，一定要走到底！”就这样，把资本主义黑货统统顶了回去。走资派无可奈何，骂他们“不听话”。他们愤怒地说：“资本主义的东西，我们就是要顶；叫我们走资本主义道路的黑话，我们就是不听！”他们坚决走毛主席指引的人民公社的道路，彻底粉碎了刘少奇复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地展开了。英雄的韶山儿女积极响应毛主席发出的“炮打司令部”的伟大战斗号召，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇及其在湖南的代理人展开了英勇顽强的斗争。他们顶逆风，战恶浪，奋起批判刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，在山间田野，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命一个又一个的胜利。伟大领袖毛主席发出“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的号召后，全公社迅速办起了三百六十多期毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达两万多人次，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了一个新高潮。英雄的韶山儿女说：“韶山的革命烈火是毛主席亲自点燃的。我们沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进，推翻了压在我们头上的三座大山，获得了翻身和解放。解放后，我们沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线继续前进，迅速走上了社会主义集体化的康庄大道。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们的命根子，是我们的生命线。我们要读一辈子毛主席的书，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。”
    热情传播伟大的毛泽东思想
    韶山，是革命的圣地。全国各地的革命人民和来自五大洲的国际友人，一批又一批地来到这里参观、瞻仰。英雄的韶山儿女，把向来自全国各地的革命人民和世界各地的国际友人传播伟大的毛泽东思想，作为自己最光荣的任务。六十多岁的革命老人毛乾吉，日夜守候在毛主席旧居，满腔热情地向来参观访问的革命群众和外国朋友宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他说：“我虽然年纪大了，但我活一天，就要坚持宣传一天伟大的毛泽东思想，歌颂一天毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！”
    韶山和全国的革命人民，为了使韶山成为传播伟大的毛泽东思想的大课堂，要求把革命圣地韶山建设好。而叛徒刘少奇及其在湖南的代理人，对韶山的建设却怕得要死，千方百计地进行阻挠和破坏。无限忠于毛主席的英雄的韶山儿女和在韶山工作的革命职工，心心向着毛主席，同一小撮阶级敌人进行了一次又一次的斗争。当年的农会会员、自卫队员和儿童团员以及无数的革命小将，一批又一批地来到毛主席从事革命活动的地方，向毛主席表决心，献忠心，为建设毛主席革命活动纪念地提供资料。在韶山工作的革命职工，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，也积极投入到韶山的建设，热情传播毛泽东思想。毛主席旧居陈列馆的革命职工，深入农村，搜集了大量革命历史资料。韶山，正以日新月异的面貌，迎接着来自四面八方的客人。
    向大寨学习，把韶山建设成
    欣欣向荣的社会主义新农村
    韶山的英雄儿女坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，以大寨为榜样，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，决心把韶山建设成为象大寨那样的社会主义新农村。可是，无产阶级文化大革命以前，叛徒刘少奇及其在湖南的代理人，却千方百计地阻挠和破坏韶山儿女开展“农业学大寨”的群众运动。无产阶级文化大革命中，韶山儿女愤怒揭露和批判了一小撮阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，更加认真地向大寨学习。他们开办了以落实毛主席“农业学大寨”的指示为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，对照大寨，找差距，订措施，决心把韶山建设得好上加好。
    在“农业学大寨”的活动中，韶山的贫下中农狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，大力突出无产阶级政治，促进人的思想革命化。他们以“老三篇”为武器，斗私批修，破私立公，牢固地树立起为革命种田、为公劳动的思想。广大社员艰苦奋斗，忘我劳动，热爱集体，热爱国家，已蔚然成风。
    “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”现在，韶山公社百分之八十以上的农田已经实现了旱涝保收。解放前，这里只种一季稻，现在双季稻面积已占百分之九十以上。去年粮食平均亩产量已由公社化前的五百斤提高到九百一十五斤。今年，这里虽然遭受了几十年来少有的山洪灾害，粮食仍然获得丰收。全公社在完成粮食征购任务以后，又主动多卖给国家三十多万斤余粮。目前，广大贫下中农和社员群众正在为夺取明年革命和生产的更大成绩作好一切准备。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”英雄的韶山儿女，广泛深入地开展了两条路线斗争史的学习运动，他们热情赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，狠揭狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，有力地推动了斗、批、改的迅猛发展。
    在空前的大好形势下，英雄的韶山儿女坚决表示，一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把红太阳升起的地方——韶山，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！（新华社记者，本报有删节）
