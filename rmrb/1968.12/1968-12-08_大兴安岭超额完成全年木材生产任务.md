The revolutionary workers of the Da Xing'anling forest area, inspired by the communique of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, have seized the revolution and promoted production, completing the annual timber production target 34 days ahead of schedule and exceeding it.

The revolutionary workers of the Da Xing'anling forest area have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply and persistently carried out the great revolutionary criticism, and severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "expert management" and "material incentives" promoted by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents. They have resolutely reformed the unreasonable rules and regulations that oppress workers. Revolutionary workers have broken down the boundaries between trades, processes, and ranks, implementing multi-skilled labor, focusing on one main task while learning others, and supporting each other closely. This has greatly liberated the productive forces. The repair shop for timber transportation and collection machinery, for example, was previously controlled by bourgeois technical "authorities" who did not allow workers to repair the machinery, causing many machines to be out of operation and production to suffer significant losses. After the workers seized the technical power of production, they fully demonstrated the high creativity and initiative of the working class. Previously, it took over half a month to repair one car, but now repairs are done as needed. Workers have also organized mobile repair teams to go to the production front line for repairs, greatly shortening the repair time, and the efficiency of timber transportation and collection has increased several times over.

Currently, the revolutionary workers in this forest area, while carrying out the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, have launched a new high tide of winter logging and timber transportation, striving to make adequate ideological and material preparations for a new leap in production next year.

    大兴安岭超额完成全年木材生产任务
    据新华社哈尔滨七日电　大兴安岭林区广大革命职工，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前三十四天超额完成了全年木材生产任务。
    大兴安岭林区的广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行的“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，坚决改革了对工人实行管、卡、压的不合理的规章制度。革命职工打破了工种、工序、级别之间的界限，实行一专多能，一行为主，兼学别样，互相支援，密切协作，大大地解放了生产力。某运材集材机械修理所，过去被资产阶级技术“权威”把持，不让工人动手修理机械，使大批机械处于瘫痪状态，生产遭到很大损失。工人夺回生产技术大权以后，充分发挥了工人阶级的高度创造性和积极性。过去修一台车，需要半个多月才能投产，现在随坏随修，工人们还组织了巡回检修队，到生产第一线去检修，大大缩短了检修时间，运材集材的效率比过去提高了几倍。
    目前，这个林区广大革命职工在开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，又掀起了冬季伐木运材的新高潮，争取为明年生产新的跃进作好充分的思想准备和物质准备。
