	Exposing the Truth Behind "Selecting the Best by Scores"
	"Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" Agricultural School Student Han Guanghua

	Liu Shaoqi, the representative of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, the loyal running dog of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, is our bitter enemy, the enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Whenever we mention this big villain, we cannot help but feel deep hatred. It was he who vigorously advocated "three freedoms and one contract," attempting to change the sky and make us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice. It was he who spread the "theory of reading books to become officials," implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, using various barriers to exclude our poor and lower-middle peasant children from schools, allowing the landlords and bourgeoisie to use the cultural power they had usurped to oppress us.

	In our Huangqiao production brigade, there are twenty-nine households. In the dark old society, every family was severely exploited and bullied by the landlords and rich peasants, living a miserable life of coarse grains and vegetables for half a year. There wasn't a single literate person in the village. It was the great leader Chairman Mao who led us in revolution, dispersing the clouds and seeing the sun. We poor and lower-middle peasants have stood up politically and economically. We must also stand up culturally! Chairman Mao cares the most about us poor and lower-middle peasants. However, Liu Shaoqi dared to openly oppose Chairman Mao. He first restricted our poor and lower-middle peasant children from entering schools in the matter of enrollment. He proposed what "selecting the best by scores." Liu Shaoqi's move is extremely malicious. Our poor and lower-middle peasant children have been working in the fields since they were young. By the age of seven or eight, they go to school, and the first barrier they encounter is the exam. Those bourgeois intellectuals use the excuse of insufficient scores to exclude our poor and lower-middle peasant children from the school gates. The children of landlords and rich peasants do not work and prepare wholeheartedly for school entrance, so they can answer questions fluently and easily enter school. Liu Shaoqi did this to open the door for the landlords and bourgeoisie to cultivate successors. After land reform, landlords and rich peasants could no longer rely on rent for exploitation, so they changed their tactics and aimed to "prosper through culture." Liu Shaoqi implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, advocating "selecting the best by scores," and enrolling a large number of landlord and rich peasant children, which was in line with the wishes of landlords and rich peasants.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should select students from workers and peasants who have practical experience, let them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice." Chairman Mao's instructions are extremely wise. Our "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" Agricultural School enrollment is recommended and selected by poor and lower-middle peasants. The facts have proven that only students recommended and selected by us poor and lower-middle peasants and cultivated by us can become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. For example, Chen Yuanchao and Qi Changying from our brigade were originally young people excluded from school by bourgeois intellectuals due to insufficient scores. Since poor and lower-middle peasants recommended them to the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" Agricultural School, after just two years of cultivation and tempering, they have become backbone members of the three great revolutionary movements, successfully cultivating new varieties of rice and wheat.

    揭“按分数择优录取”的老底
    “抗大”农校学员　阚广华
    刘少奇这个地主、资产阶级总代表，帝、修、反的忠实走狗，是我们贫下中农的死对头。一提起这个大坏蛋，我们就难平心头之恨。是他，竭力鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”，妄想变天，要我们贫下中农吃二遍苦，受二茬罪。是他，大肆散布“读书做官论”，推行反革命修正主义教育路线，用种种关卡把我们贫下中农子女排斥在学校门外，让地主、资产阶级利用篡夺在手的文权专我们的政。
    我们黄桥生产队二十九户人家，在黑暗的旧社会里，家家受尽了地主、富农的压榨和欺凌，过着糠菜半年粮的苦难生活，村上一个识字的人也没有。是伟大的领袖毛主席领导我们闹革命，驱散乌云见太阳，我们贫下中农在政治、经济上都得到了翻身。我们在文化上也要翻身！毛主席最关心我们贫下中农。可是，刘少奇竟胆大包天，公开同毛主席唱反调。他首先在招生问题上限制我们贫下中农子女入学。他提出什么“按分数择优录取”。刘少奇这一着是十分恶毒的。我们贫下中农子女从小就在田头劳动，到七、八岁去上学，第一关就碰到考试，那些资产阶级知识分子就以分数不够格为理由，将我们贫下中农子女排斥在学校大门外。地富子女不劳动，一心一意地为入学做准备，因而回答试题“头头是道”，很容易入学。刘少奇这样做，为地主、资产阶级造就接班人大开了方便之门。土地改革以后，地主、富农不能再靠地租剥削了，他们就转变花样，“靠文化发家”。刘少奇推行反革命修正主义教育路线，提倡“按分数择优录取”，大量吸收地主、富农子女入学，就是适应地主、富农的愿望。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的指示是非常英明的。我们“抗大”农校招生就是贫下中农推荐和选拔的。事实证明，只有由我们贫下中农自己推荐与选拔的学生，由贫下中农自己培养，才能成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。如我们大队的陈元朝、祁长英，原来都是被资产阶级知识分子以分数不够格排斥在学校门外的青年，自从贫下中农把他们推荐到“抗大”农校后，经过短短两年的培养和锻炼，已经成了三大革命运动中的骨干，成功地培育出了稻、麦的新良种。
