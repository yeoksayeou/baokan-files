I have been involved in primary education and primary education administration for nearly sixty years, and it was around 1962 that I voluntarily retired from the stage of primary education history. The reason for my retirement, although related to age, was mainly because I am a bourgeois intellectual. Before liberation, I ran schools for the bourgeoisie, and even for the reactionary Kuomintang; after liberation, in a socialist society under proletarian rule, I could not come up with a new set of methods for running primary schools that were suitable for socialism. I often said: "I have nothing to do with education anymore, I can't run schools, and I don't even dare to talk about education!" Therefore, I tried every means to retire from the primary education sector.

Regarding Liu Shaoqi's half-work-half-study (half-farm-half-study) education, although I did not dare to oppose it at the time, I also felt that if only a few schools did this and the majority of schools remained full-time, it would not be a viable good method. Since I had retired from the stage of education history, I could only let it go and even went along with the crowd. It was not until the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat that someone criticized Liu Shaoqi's method of half-work-half-study and full-time education coexisting as the "dual-track system" of capitalist countries, which was set up to restore capitalism by separating workers and peasants and the bourgeoisie, that I finally realized. But I still did not know how to run primary education in a proletarian socialist society.

Recently, I saw the latest and highest directive from our great teacher Chairman Mao: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue. 'To carry out the proletarian education revolution, it is necessary for the working class to take the lead, ... and in the countryside, it should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Only then did I understand the correct direction of proletarian rule over schools.

In recent days, I have seen in the newspapers the facts and achievements of workers leading schools and poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools, and I feel that Chairman Mao's above-mentioned directives are gradually being implemented. I have even greater admiration for Chairman Mao's great wisdom.

On November 14, I read the letter from comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu suggesting "All public primary schools should be handed over to the production brigades to run," and I think their opinions are very good. Not only do they have five advantages and three solutions to the problems of teachers' living and adjustment, but they can also truly accelerate the popularization of primary education in rural areas to a great extent.

Regarding the fifth advantage, since the specific situations of production brigades across the country are different, some poor brigades may not be able to afford the cost of running schools, and they can still be subsidized by the state. The original text also takes this into account, so it only says to reduce the burden on the state and does not say to completely eliminate the state's burden. Regarding the second problem of teacher adjustment, I have also thought about this before, so I agree with it even more.

Whether the Bureau of Education and Culture is still needed is a question. If the county does not need the Bureau of Education and Culture, then the province and city would not need the Department of Education, and the central government would not need the Ministry of Education, is this appropriate? My opinion is that the Bureau of Education and Culture, Department of Education, and Ministry of Education are still needed. However, the internal structure should be streamlined and led by the working class. Its tasks can be changed to focus on research, editing, and other issues related to national and local coordination and unity. For example, some textbooks can be arranged and edited by each primary school, and some textbooks cannot be arranged and edited without the state. The things that are arranged and edited by each other should of course be mutually researched and agreed upon to achieve coordination; some still need to be arranged and edited according to the state's educational policy (mainly according to Mao Zedong Thought) to achieve unity. In short, everything about education should also be democratic and centralized, and it should also come from the masses and return to the masses, avoiding both top-down arbitrary decisions and bottom-up chaos, and the top becoming the tail of the masses. How to specifically implement this should be determined from the measures of struggle, criticism, and reform.

The problem raised by comrades Hou and Wang is, of course, about public primary schools in rural areas being handed over to production brigades to run. What about public primary schools in large and medium-sized cities? I think that if there are factories nearby, primary schools in large and medium-sized cities can also be handed over to the factories to run. If there are no factories nearby, the nearest or relatively nearby factories should strengthen leadership and management. The advantages of factory-run schools are similar to those of brigade-run schools. As for the problem of funding for city-run schools, the state seems to cannot greatly reduce the burden, so as not to affect factory production.

In this way, it seems that primary schools in both urban and rural areas have implemented the latest and highest directives of the great leader Chairman Mao, and it is indeed proletarian rule over schools, no longer bourgeois intellectuals ruling schools.

I have not talked about education for a long time, and now I am expressing my opinions according to the editor's note in the People's Daily. I don't know if it is appropriate? I still hope everyone will study and criticize it.

### 我对“建议”的看法

    我对“建议”的看法
    我是一个办了将近六十年小学教育和小学教育行政的人，到一九六二年左右才自动退出了小学教育的历史舞台。退出的缘故，虽然和年龄有关，但主要还是由于自己是资产阶级知识分子，在解放前办学是为资产阶级，甚至为国民党反动派服务；解放后，在无产阶级统治的社会主义社会中拿不出一套办小学教育的新的适应社会主义的办法来。我常说：“我对教育一无所有了，不能再办教育，甚至不敢再谈教育了！”因此，千方百计从小学教育界退了出来。
    对刘少奇的那一套半工半读（半农半读）的教育，当时我虽不敢反对，但也觉得如果只是少数学校这样做，大多数学校仍是全日制，那也不是行得通的好办法。因为自己既然退出了教育的历史舞台，就也只好让它去，甚至随声附和了。直到无产阶级文化大革命时期，有人批判刘少奇的那一套半工半读和全日制并存的办法是资本主义国家的“双轨制”，是为复辟资本主义而分别工农和资产阶级而设置的学制，我才恍然大悟。但对无产阶级社会主义的小学教育如何办，仍旧不知所从。
    近来看到伟大导师毛主席的最新最高指示：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，……在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”我才体会到无产阶级统治学校的正确方向。
    连日看报，又看到工人领导学校、贫下中农管理学校的事实和成绩，我才觉得毛主席的上述指示已经逐步落实。对毛主席的伟大英明，更加无限钦仰。
    十一月十四日读了侯振民、王庆余两位同志的“建议所有公办小学下放到大队来办”的来信，觉得他们的意见很好，不但有五个好处，三个关于教师生活和调动问题的解决办法，而且真正能够大大加速农村小学教育的普及。
    关于第五个好处，由于全国公社大队的具体情况不同，有些穷大队负担不起办学经费，仍可以由国家多加补助。原文也照顾到这点，所以只说减轻国家负担，并没有说完全不要国家负担。关于第二个教师调整问题，我以前也这样想过，因此我更加赞同。
    文教局是否还要？这是一个问题。如果县里不要文教局，那末省里、市里就不要教育厅、局，中央就不要教育部，这是否妥善？我的意思，文教局、教育厅局、教育部还是要的。不过机构内部要精简，要由工人阶级领导。它的任务是否可以改为专注重研究、编辑等有关国家和地方协调统一等性质的问题。例如有些课程教材等可以由各小学各自安排研究、编辑，有些课程教材等不能不由国家安排编辑。彼此安排编辑的东西，当然应该互相研究、互相同意，以使协调；有些还得按照国家的教育政策（主要是按照毛泽东思想）安排编辑，以使统一。总之，教育的一切，也要又民主又集中，也要从群众中来，再到群众中去，既免上面独断独行，也免下面各行其是，上面成为群众的尾巴。如何具体落实，这要从斗、批、改的措施中确定下来。
    侯、王两位同志提出的当然是农村的公办小学下放归大队办的问题，大中城市的城区小学又怎么办呢？我认为大中城市的城区小学，如果附近有工厂的，也可以下放给工厂办。附近没有工厂的，要由最近或较近的工厂加强领导和管理。工厂办学的好处和大队办学的好处差不多。至于城区办学的经费问题，国家似乎不能大大减轻，以免影响工厂生产。
    这样做，似乎城乡小学都落实了伟大领袖毛主席的最新最高指示，确实是无产阶级统治学校，不再是资产阶级知识分子统治学校了。
    久不谈教育，现在按照《人民日报》编者按来发表一点意见，不知是否对？还请大家研究批评。
