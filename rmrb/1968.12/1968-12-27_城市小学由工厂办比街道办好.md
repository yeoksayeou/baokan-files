Currently, opinions published in newspapers about how to run primary schools in cities generally fall into three categories: first, run by factories; second, run by neighborhood committees; third, a combination of neighborhood committees, factories, and schools. We believe that running schools by factories is better.

First, factories running schools allow the working class to better directly control the leadership of the schools.

If primary schools in cities are run by factories, the schools will be directly led by the factory revolutionary committees and become a part of the factory. This not only ensures that the leadership is firmly in the hands of the working class but also allows the broad masses of workers to study, discuss, and participate in the educational revolution at any time. If run by neighborhood committees, since the schools are not part of the factory, it is not conducive to the working class directly managing the schools, nor is it conducive to the broad masses of workers participating in the educational revolution with an owner's attitude.

Second, factories running schools allow the working class to better cultivate successors to the revolutionary cause according to their own needs.

The working class is the leading class of the revolution. If primary schools in cities are run by factories, it will be possible to fully implement Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and to make students learn the excellent qualities of the working class from an early age and temper them into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture through the three great revolutionary movements. If run by neighborhood committees, although there is an advantage in combining school education with family education, due to the complex composition of urban neighborhood residents, it is not conducive to cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause according to the needs of the working class.

Third, factories running schools allow teachers to better receive re-education from the working class.

The original primary school teachers in cities have a large and complex composition. Some are not suitable for proletarian educational work, while some revolutionary teachers should remain in the school. Of course, these teachers must also receive re-education from the working class. If run by factories, these revolutionary teachers can teach on one hand and work in the workshop on the other. If run by neighborhood committees, although schools can be linked with factories for labor, since teachers do not live among the working class, it is not convenient for them to receive re-education from the working class, which is not conducive to their ideological transformation.

Fourth, factories running schools can better select outstanding workers as teachers and facilitate part-time teachers' work.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most important problem in a military school is to select the principal and teachers and to determine the educational policy." Therefore, to run a school well, it is necessary to build a new type of teaching team. In addition to re-educating the teachers who remain in the school, it is also necessary to select a group of outstanding workers to join the teaching team and invite some workers with rich experience in class struggle and production struggle to be part-time teachers. If the school is run by the factory, it is beneficial to solve this problem and also facilitates the work of part-time teachers. If run by neighborhood committees, it is difficult to solve this problem. For example, in our Shangrao City, there are few retired workers, and some neighborhoods have almost none, making it impossible to solve the problem of part-time teachers and difficult to select teachers.

Fifth, factories running schools facilitate the combination of education and productive labor.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To decide on work policies according to actual conditions is the most basic working method that all communists must always remember." According to Chairman Mao's teaching, we advocate that primary schools in cities should be run by factories, not that regardless of conditions, this should be done uniformly, but that in places with conditions, it should be done as much as possible by factories. As for some urban areas without factories or far from factories, they can be run by neighborhood committees, with workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering the schools to lead these neighborhood-run primary schools, and teachers and students can be linked with factories or suburban production teams for labor. For some small factories that find it difficult to run a school, several factories can jointly run a school.

The above opinions are for discussion and criticism.

### 城市小学由工厂办比街道办好

    城市小学由工厂办比街道办好
    目前报纸上发表的关于城市小学应该如何办的意见，不外三种：一、由工厂办；二、由街道办；三、以街道为主，工厂、学校三结合办。我们认为工厂办比街道办更好。
    一、工厂办，工人阶级能更好地直接掌握学校的领导权。
    城市小学由工厂来办，学校直接由厂革委会领导，成为工厂的一个组成部分，这样不但领导权牢牢地掌握在工人阶级手里，而且工厂的广大工人群众能随时直接研究、讨论、参与学校的教育革命。而由街道办，由于学校没有成为工厂的一个组成部分，不利于工人阶级直接管理学校，也不利于广大工人群众以主人翁的态度直接参加学校的教育革命。
    二、工厂办，工人阶级能更好地按照自己的需要培养革命事业的接班人。
    工人阶级是革命的领导阶级，城市的小学由工厂来办，就能全面地落实毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示，就能使学生从小学习工人阶级的优秀品质，在三大革命运动中锻炼成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。而街道办，虽然有使校内教育与校外教育、家庭教育结合起来的优越性，但由于城市街道居民成份复杂，对于按照工人阶级的需要培养革命事业接班人不利。
    三、工厂办，教师能更好地接受工人阶级的再教育。
    城市原有的小学教师，队伍庞大，成份复杂，一部分人不宜于担任无产阶级的教育工作，一部分革命教师则应留校工作，当然，这部分教师也必须接受工人阶级的再教育。由工厂来办，这部分革命教师就可以一面教书，一面固定在车间劳动。而由街道办，虽然学校可以与工厂挂钩劳动，但是由于教师没有生活在工人群众之中，不便于接受工人阶级的再教育，对他们的思想改造不利。
    四、工厂办，能更好地选拔优秀工人当教师，也便于兼职教师进行工作。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个军事学校，最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针。”因此，要办好学校，必须建立一支新型的教师队伍。除对留校教师进行再教育外，还必须选拔一批优秀工人加入教师队伍，邀请一些有丰富阶级斗争经验和生产斗争经验的工人当兼职教师。学校由工厂来办，有利于解决这个问题，也便于兼职教师进行工作。而由街道办，则很难解决这个问题。象我们上饶市退休工人很少，有的街道几乎没有，兼职教师就无法解决，选拔教师也有困难。
    五、工厂办，便于把教育与生产劳动结合起来。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。”按照毛主席这一教导，我们主张城市小学由工厂来办，并不是说不管条件如何，一律要这样做，而是说在有条件的地方应该尽量做到由工厂来办。至于有的城区没有工厂或离工厂较远，则可以由街道来办，由工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进学校，领导这个街道办的小学，师生则可以与工厂或郊区生产队挂钩劳动。有的工厂较小，办一所学校有困难，则可以由几个工厂合办一个学校。
    以上意见是否正确，请大家研究批评。
