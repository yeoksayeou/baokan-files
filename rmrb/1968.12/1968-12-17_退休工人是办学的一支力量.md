We believe that after the establishment of neighborhood-run primary schools, full use should be made of retired workers.

In the past, the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line poisoned many young people, causing some primary school students to look down on the working class. They would say things like, "You don't know anything." Now, with the neighborhood taking the lead in running primary schools and workers, peasants, and soldiers taking to the podium, we can directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses and rely on retired workers with deep class hatred and high class consciousness. This way, we can run the schools even better. Retired workers have suffered the most and have the highest consciousness. They are best at using class struggle facts to educate the next generation, ensuring that students always maintain the character of the working people and from a young age forge a heart that loves Chairman Mao, loves Mao Zedong Thought, and loves Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the past, alleys were relatively complex places, but during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after the class ranks were purged, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought was widely popularized in the alleys. Retired workers will play a role in the alleys. We firmly believe that retired workers directly participating in school management will definitely make this proletarian stronghold of the school forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

    退休工人是办学的一支力量
    我们认为，街道办小学以后，应当充分发挥退休工人的作用。
    过去，反革命修正主义教育路线毒害了许多青少年，使得一些小学生轻视劳动人民。他们看不起退休老工人，说什么“你们不懂知识”。现在以街道为主办小学，工农兵走上讲台，直接依靠广大革命群众，依靠苦大仇深的阶级觉悟高的退休工人，这样就可以把学校办得更好。老工人受苦最深，觉悟最高，他们最善于用阶级斗争的事实教育下一代，使学生永远保持劳动人民的本色，从小锤炼一颗热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席革命路线的红心。
    过去，里弄这种地方是比较复杂的，但在无产阶级文化大革命中，经过清理阶级队伍以后，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在里弄得到了空前的大普及。退休老工人将在里弄中起作用。我们深信，退休工人直接参加管理学校，一定可以使学校这块无产阶级阵地，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
