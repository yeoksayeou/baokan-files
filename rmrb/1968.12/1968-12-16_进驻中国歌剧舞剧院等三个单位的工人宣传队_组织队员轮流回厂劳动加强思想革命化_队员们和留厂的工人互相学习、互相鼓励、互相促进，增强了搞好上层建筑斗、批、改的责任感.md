Workers' propaganda teams stationed at China Opera and Ballet Theater and other units organize members to rotate back to the factory for labor to strengthen ideological revolutionization. Members learn from and encourage each other with workers who remain at the factory, enhancing their sense of responsibility in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Workers' propaganda teams from Beijing stationed at China Opera and Ballet Theater, Central Opera and Ballet Theater, and Yongjin Opera Troupe, have earnestly implemented the battle call issued in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. While leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure and using Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals, they organize members to return to the factory in batches to participate in production labor, continuously strengthening the revolutionization of the propaganda teams.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed at China Opera and Ballet Theater, Central Opera and Ballet Theater, and Yongjin Opera Troupe are mainly composed of excellent industrial workers from Beijing Second Textile Mill, supplemented by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. After entering these three units, they held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals, and together with revolutionary masses, studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticizing the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center means no center" theory, quickly bringing a new atmosphere to these three units. In this process, the propaganda teams, to strengthen their own ideological construction, continuously organized members to rotate back to the factory to participate in production labor. After the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was published, the workers' propaganda teams, in accordance with the spirit of "participating in this glorious task, workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and PLA soldiers must continuously improve their political awareness in the struggle" mentioned in the communiqué, enhanced their awareness of returning to the factory to participate in production labor, and strengthened organizational leadership, making the work of returning to the factory to participate in production labor even better.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have realized that rotating back to the factory to participate in production labor has three major advantages:

First, it further promotes personal ideological revolutionization. Those who return to the factory to participate in production labor all deeply feel: We came from the factory to China Opera and Ballet Theater and other cultural units, interacting with intellectuals, living in high-rise buildings, not hearing the sound of machines, not getting oil and dirt on our bodies, and our calluses softening. Only by frequently returning to the factory to participate in production labor can we further strengthen our own ideological revolutionization and lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure well.

Second, mutual learning, encouragement, and promotion with workers who remain at the factory. In returning to the factory for labor, they exchange experiences with workers who remain at the factory on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and on how to grasp class struggle and earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Workers who remain at the factory encourage propaganda team members to earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and successfully complete the great historical mission of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure. Propaganda team members, seeing the workers who remain at the factory's fierce revolutionary spirit and surging momentum to promote production, are greatly inspired, enhancing their sense of responsibility in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure.

Third, it is more conducive to re-educating intellectuals. While leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the cultural field, the workers' propaganda teams rotate back to the factory to participate in production labor, strengthening their own ideological revolutionization. This practice deeply educates the broad revolutionary masses of China Opera and Ballet Theater and other three units. They say: The workers' class has the reddest heart and is the most loyal to Chairman Mao. They not only lead us in the struggle, criticism, and transformation but also take time to return to the factory to participate in production labor. We intellectuals lack the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class. We must take the working class as an example, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    进驻中国歌剧舞剧院等三个单位的工人宣传队
    组织队员轮流回厂劳动加强思想革命化
    队员们和留厂的工人互相学习、互相鼓励、互相促进，增强了搞好上层建筑斗、批、改的责任感
    新华社讯　进驻中国歌剧舞剧院等三个单位的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队，认真贯彻落实党的八届十二中全会公报发出的战斗号召，在领导上层建筑斗、批、改和用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育的同时，组织队员分期分批轮流回厂参加生产劳动，不断加强宣传队自身的革命化。
    进驻中国歌剧舞剧院、中央歌剧舞剧院、勇进评剧团三个单位的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队，是以北京第二毛纺织厂优秀的产业工人为主体，配合中国人民解放军战士组成的。他们进驻中国歌剧舞剧院等三个单位后，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，同革命群众一起学习、落实毛主席一系列最新指示，狠批反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”，使这三个单位很快呈现出一片新气象。在这过程中，宣传队为了加强本身的思想建设，不断组织队员轮流回厂参加生产劳动。党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，工人宣传队对照公报中指出的“参加这项光荣任务的工人、贫下中农、人民解放军指战员，要在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的精神，增强了回厂参加生产劳动的自觉性，并且加强了组织领导，使回厂参加生产劳动的工作做得更好了。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队体会到，轮流回厂参加生产劳动有三大好处：
    一，进一步促进了自身思想革命化。回厂参加生产劳动的同志们都深有感触地说：我们由工厂来到中国歌剧舞剧院等文艺单位，接触的是知识分子，住的是高楼大厦，耳朵里听不到机器响，身上油泥沾不上，手上的老茧也软了。只有经常回厂参加生产劳动，进一步加强自身的思想革命化，才能领导好上层建筑的斗、批、改。
    二，和留厂的工人互相学习、互相鼓励、互相促进。他们在回厂劳动中，同留厂的工人一起，交流活学活用毛主席著作的体会和狠抓阶级斗争、认真搞好斗、批、改的经验。留厂的工人们鼓励宣传队的同志认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，胜利地完成上层建筑斗、批、改的伟大历史使命。宣传队的同志们看到留厂的工人们狠抓革命，猛促生产的冲天干劲，受到很大鼓舞，增强了搞好上层建筑斗、批、改的责任感。
    三，更有利于对知识分子进行再教育。工人宣传队的同志们一方面领导文艺领域的斗、批、改，一方面轮流回厂参加生产劳动，加强自身思想革命化的做法，深深地教育了中国歌剧舞剧院等三个单位的广大革命群众。他们说：工人阶级的心最红，对毛主席最忠。他们不仅领导我们搞斗、批、改，还抽时间回厂参加生产劳动。我们这些知识分子就是缺乏工人阶级的彻底革命精神，我们一定要以工人阶级为榜样，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
