Since the Hong Kong authorities continue to detain our patriotic journalists, the Chinese government has every reason to continue restricting Gray's freedom of movement. This is the consistent stance of the Chinese government. The hard-pressed British government is distorting right and wrong, stirring up anti-China hysteria, which does no harm to the great Chinese people but only ends up hurting itself.

	New China News Agency, December 27th: Recently, the British government, beset by internal and external problems, has tried to deceive public opinion and divert domestic discontent by distorting facts and inciting anti-China sentiment over the Gray issue. It has not only mobilized all its propaganda machines to make a big fuss but also had Prime Minister Wilson and Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Stewart personally attack China. This despicable act by the British government only shows its futile efforts.

	On December 3rd, British Prime Minister Wilson said in parliament that the Chinese government's "detention of Gray is completely unreasonable." This is sheer nonsense!

	It is well known that since May of last year, the British authorities in Hong Kong have brutally suppressed our patriotic compatriots, arresting thousands of them. On July 11th of last year, they illegally arrested Xue Ping, a journalist from the Hong Kong branch of our New China News Agency, who was conducting normal reporting activities, and sentenced him to two years in prison on trumped-up charges. Then, on July 15th, they illegally arrested seven patriotic journalists from the Hong Kong branch of our New China News Agency and other organizations, subjecting them to illegal detention and interrogation, and sentenced them to prison terms. This is a serious political provocation against the Chinese people, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. Under these circumstances, the News Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on July 21st of last year that it would restrict the freedom of movement of Reuters correspondent Gray in Beijing, not allowing him to leave his residence without permission and requiring him to await further instructions. The Chinese government's measures are completely reasonable. The Hong Kong British authorities, in order to persecute our patriotic compatriots and journalists, have concocted a series of so-called "emergency regulations." According to these "regulations," three of our patriotic compatriots gathering together can be charged with "illegal assembly," journalists conducting normal reporting can be charged with participating in "threatening assemblies," and even staying at home can be charged with trumped-up offenses, and so on. Our large number of patriotic compatriots and journalists have been arbitrarily arrested, falsely accused, and sentenced by the Hong Kong British authorities, subjected to savage persecution. This is the height of fascist brutality. Even British legal professionals in Hong Kong cannot help but admit that it is "barbaric," "totalitarian," and "terrorist rule."

	British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary Stewart, on November 27th, issued a statement claiming that Gray is "subject to inhuman restrictions," and the Hong Kong British authorities also maliciously slandered the relevant Chinese authorities for "not respecting the normal standards of civilized behavior." This is a complete fabrication and slander. The facts are the opposite. Gray's treatment is generous. He lives in his original residence, and his living conditions are basically the same as before his movement was restricted. On November 26th, British Chargé d'Affaires Coley and Second Secretary Gaiste visited Gray, and afterwards, they had to admit that Gray is "in good health." These two British diplomats gave their superiors a resounding slap in the face! Over the past year, the British authorities in Hong Kong have arrested a large number of our patriotic compatriots, subjected them to beatings and torture, and many patriotic compatriots, including journalists, have been severely injured. To this day, 360 people are still being held in dark, windowless concentration camps and prisons. The Hong Kong British authorities have even killed many of our patriotic compatriots. Yet, people like Stewart still talk about "humanity" and "civilization," which is truly shameless.

	The British government also claims that the Hong Kong authorities have released Xue Ping and eight other journalists, while China has not released Gray, and that the Chinese government has "changed its stance." This is a malicious distortion and slander. The Chinese government's stance on the Gray issue has always been clear. In the statement issued by the News Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on July 21st of last year, it was announced that the Chinese government decided to restrict Gray's freedom of movement due to the Hong Kong British authorities' savage persecution of eight journalists from the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency and other patriotic journalists. However, the Hong Kong British authorities not only did not immediately release all eight of our patriotic journalists but also intensified their arrests, detaining even more of our patriotic journalists. To this day, 13 people have not been released. Since the Hong Kong British authorities continue to detain our 13 patriotic journalists, the Chinese government has every reason to continue restricting Gray's freedom of movement. This is the consistent stance of the Chinese government.

	The British government's incitement of anti-China sentiment over the Gray issue, attempting to force the Chinese government to change its principled stance, is completely futile. Their unreasonable behavior not only does not help to solve the problem but also makes the problem more complicated.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools." The British government's anti-China hysteria does no harm to the great Chinese people but only ends up hurting itself.

### 英国政府就格雷问题煽动反华绝不能得逞

    英国政府就格雷问题煽动反华绝不能得逞
    既然港英当局继续监禁我爱国新闻工作者，中国政府就有充分的理由继续限制格雷的行动自由。这是中国政府的一贯立场。心劳日拙的英国政府颠倒是非，掀起反华叫嚣，丝毫无损于伟大的中国人民，只能是搬起石头打它自己的脚
    新华社二十七日讯　最近，内外交困的英国政府，为了欺骗舆论，转移国内人民的不满，竟然颠倒是非，混淆黑白，利用路透社记者格雷问题掀起了一场反华叫嚣。它不仅开动各种宣传机器，大肆鼓噪，而且由英国首相威尔逊、外交和联邦事务大臣斯图尔特等人亲自出马攻击中国。英国政府这种恶劣行径，只能表明它的心劳日拙。
    今年十二月三日，英国首相威尔逊在议会里说什么中国政府“扣留格雷是完全没有道理的”。这纯粹是胡说！
    众所周知，去年五月以来，香港英国当局接连对我爱国同胞进行野蛮镇压，逮捕了数千名我爱国同胞，并于去年七月十一日无理拘捕正在进行正常采访活动的我新华社香港分社记者薛平，加以莫须有的罪名，判刑两年，关进监狱。接着又于七月十五日，无理拘捕了我香港新华分社等七名爱国记者，对他们进行非法扣押和审讯，并判了刑期。这是对中国人民的严重政治挑衅，是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。在这种情况下，中国外交部新闻司于去年七月二十一日宣布，限制路透社驻北京记者格雷的行动自由，不准他擅自离开住所，要他听候处理。中国政府采取这种措施，是完全有道理的。香港英国当局为了疯狂迫害我爱国同胞和爱国记者，炮制了一系列的所谓“紧急法例”。根据这些“法例”，我爱国同胞三人在一起就可以被判“非法集会”罪，记者进行正常采访可以被判参加“威胁性集会”罪，甚至闭门家中坐也可以被判以莫须有的罪名，等等，等等。我大批爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者，就是这样被港英当局任意逮捕，横加罪名，随便判刑，野蛮迫害，这才是毫无道理的，是十足的法西斯暴行。就连香港的英国资产阶级法律界人士，也不能不承认这是“野蛮的”、“极权的”、“恐怖统治”。
    英国外交和联邦事务大臣斯图尔特，十一月二十七日还发表声明，胡说什么格雷“受到非人道的限制”，港英当局也大肆诬蔑中国有关当局“不尊重文明行为的正常标准”。这是彻头彻尾的捏造和诬蔑。事实完全相反，格雷所受到的待遇是宽大的。他住在自己原来的住所里，他的起居饮食条件基本上和他行动受到限制以前没有什么两样。十一月二十六日，英国驻华临时代办柯利达和二等秘书盖思德探视了格雷，事后他们都不得不承认格雷“身体很好”。这两个英国外交官员的话，给了他们的上司一记响亮的耳光！一年多来，香港英国当局拘捕了我大批爱国同胞，对他们进行毒打和折磨，许多爱国同胞包括新闻工作者，身体受到严重的摧残，至今还有三百六十多人被关在暗无天日的集中营和监狱里。港英当局甚至还杀害了我许多爱国同胞。斯图尔特之流居然还侈谈什么“人道”和“文明”，真是恬不知耻。
    英国官方还说什么港英当局已经释放了薛平等八名新闻工作者，而中国仍然不释放格雷，中国政府“改变了立场”。这更是恶意的歪曲和诽谤。中国政府关于格雷问题的立场一直是明确的。中国外交部新闻司去年七月二十一日发表的声明中曾经宣布：中国政府决定限制格雷的行动自由，是由于港英当局对香港新华分社记者和其他爱国新闻工作者八人进行野蛮的迫害。但是，港英当局非但不立即全部释放我八名爱国新闻工作者，反而变本加厉地又陆续拘禁了我更多的爱国新闻工作者，至今仍有十三人未被释放。既然港英当局继续监禁我十三名爱国新闻工作者，中国政府就有充分的理由继续限制格雷的行动自由。这就是中国政府的一贯立场。
    英国政府就格雷问题掀起反华叫嚣，妄图迫使中国政府改变自己的严正立场，完全是徒劳的。他们这种无理取闹的做法，不仅无助于问题的解决，而且使问题更加复杂化。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”英国政府的反华叫嚣，丝毫无损于伟大的中国人民，只能是搬起石头打它自己的脚。
