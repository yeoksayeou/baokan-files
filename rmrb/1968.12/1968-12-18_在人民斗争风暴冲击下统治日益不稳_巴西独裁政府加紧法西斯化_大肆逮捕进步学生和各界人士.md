	Under the impact of the people's struggle storm, the rule becomes increasingly unstable. The Brazilian dictatorship government speeds up fascistization and massively arrests progressive students and people from all walks of life.

	New China News Agency, December 16th: Rio de Janeiro news: The Brazilian pro-American military dictatorship, in order to maintain its increasingly unstable ruling position, recently brazenly took further fascist measures.

	This reactionary regime announced a so-called "institutional law" on the 13th, followed by the closure of the parliament, "military supervision" over all newspapers, radio stations, and television stations, and large-scale arrests in major cities. This shows that the Brazilian military dictatorship has completely abandoned its original thin layer of bourgeois democratic facade and is implementing barefaced fascist rule.

	According to reports, the so-called "institutional law" stipulates that the dictatorship led by Costa e Silva can indefinitely close the parliament, can arbitrarily declare a national state of siege, can strip all people, including members of the National Congress, of their political rights, can confiscate citizens' property, and can take action against the Supreme Court, etc. After this law was promulgated, many newspapers were closed, former President Kubitschek, Quadros, and many state legislators were arrested. Those arrested also include some student movement leaders, journalists and editors, lawyers, and artists, totaling hundreds of people, including the famous Brazilian lawyer Sobral Pinto.

	The Costa e Silva military dictatorship took further fascist measures in the context of the increasingly intense anti-American patriotic struggle of the broad masses of the Brazilian people, the further intensification of contradictions within the ruling clique, and the increasingly weak and shaky position of the military clique. Since its establishment in 1964, the Brazilian pro-American military dictatorship has been strongly opposed by the Brazilian people. In April, June, and August of this year, the anti-American, anti-dictatorship struggle of the Brazilian people further developed rapidly, reaching a new high unseen in several years. This struggle swept across 22 states, starting from the strike struggle and demonstrations with tens of thousands of students participating, expanding into a broad anti-American patriotic movement with the participation of teachers, artists, journalists, and other strata of people. The rapid development of the people's anti-American struggle has intensified the contradictions within the ruling class.

	The further fascistization of the Brazilian pro-American military dictatorship does not indicate its strength; on the contrary, it precisely indicates its weakness. No matter what measures this military dictatorship takes, it cannot save its inevitable fate of complete collapse.

    在人民斗争风暴冲击下统治日益不稳
    巴西独裁政府加紧法西斯化
    大肆逮捕进步学生和各界人士
    新华社十六日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西亲美军事独裁政权为维护它日益不稳的统治地位，最近悍然采取了进一步法西斯化的措施。
    这个反动政权在十三日晚宣布了一项所谓“制度法”，接着封闭了议会，对所有报纸、电台和电视台实行了“军事监督”，并且在各主要城市大肆搜捕。这就表明，巴西军事独裁政权已经完全抛弃了原有的一层薄薄的资产阶级民主的外衣，实行赤裸裸的法西斯统治。
    据报道，所谓“制度法”规定，以科斯塔—席尔瓦为首的独裁政府可以不定期地封闭议会，可以任意宣布全国戒严令，可以剥夺一切人，其中包括全国议会议员等人的政治权利，可以没收公民的财产，还可以对最高法院采取行动等等。这个法令公布后，许多家报纸被封闭，前总统库比契克、夸德罗斯以及许多州议员等被捕。被捕的还有一些学生运动领导人、新闻记者和编辑、律师、艺术工作者等共达数百人，其中包括巴西著名律师苏布拉尔·平托。
    科斯塔—席尔瓦军事独裁政权是在巴西广大人民群众反美爱国斗争日益高涨，统治集团内部矛盾更加激化，军事集团的地位更加虚弱和动摇的情况下，悍然采取进一步法西斯化的措施的。巴西亲美军事独裁政权从一九六四年建立时起，就遭到巴西人民的强烈反对。在今年四月、六月和八月，巴西人民反美、反独裁斗争进一步地迅猛发展，出现了几年来未有的新高潮，这一斗争席卷二十二个州，从有数以万计的学生参加的罢课斗争、游行示威开始，扩展为有教师、艺术工作者、新闻记者及其他阶层人士参加的广泛的反美爱国运动。人民群众反美斗争的迅猛发展，加剧了统治阶级内部的矛盾。
    巴西亲美军事独裁政权的进一步法西斯化，这并不表明它的强大，恰恰相反，正好表明了它的虚弱。无论这个军事独裁政权采取什么样的手段，都无法挽救它必将彻底垮台的命运。
