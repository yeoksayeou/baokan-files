We revolutionary soldiers always keep in mind Chairman Mao's teachings: "We are the great People's Liberation Army, a great army led by the great Communist Party of China. As long as we always follow the Party's directives, we will surely win." After the victory of the War of Resistance, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi in his poisonous weed "The New Stage of Peace and Democracy" proposed to abolish the Party branches, Party committees, and political commissars in the army, and to abolish Party organizations in the military. He shamelessly said: "Such a change is necessary," "It must be changed." He also absurdly claimed: "This change does not alter the essence of the people's army in the slightest, and it will continue to improve." The great traitor Liu Shaoqi attempted to separate the military from the Party and abolish the Party's leadership over the revolutionary army. This is a shameful betrayal of the proletarian revolution!

Ten years before the "New Stage of Peace and Democracy" was published, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "In the era when the proletariat has taken the political stage, ... any revolutionary war without or against the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party is bound to fail." At a time when our country is at a critical juncture between two destinies and two futures, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi wants to abolish our Party's leadership over the military, abolish political commissars, and abolish the political work system. This is to strip our army of its soul. In essence, it is to make our Communist Party surrender the leadership of the military to Chiang Kai-shek.

The people's army must be absolutely under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The reason why our army can represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat, can attack and conquer, and is invincible in battle, is because it has the leadership of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The People's Liberation Army has established its own powerful revolutionary political work, which is a major factor in our victory over the enemy." Looking through the history of our Party and our army, which victory was not due to Chairman Mao's wise leadership? Which failure and setback was not due to deviating from Mao Zedong Thought?

There is no such thing as a classless army in the world. An army without the leadership of the "Party" does not exist. The Nationalist Party's Chiang Kai-shek did everything possible to make our Party give up the leadership of the military. Thus, China would only have the Nationalist Party controlling the military. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi, after the victory of the War of Resistance, attempted to make our military not listen to the Party and not listen to Chairman Mao, in order to meet Chiang Kai-shek's needs.

The role of the Party's leadership in the military is to ensure that the military has a firm and correct political direction, to ensure the absolute leadership of Mao Zedong Thought over the military, and to make our army a armed group that executes the Party's political tasks. The task of political work is to constantly arm the minds of cadres and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought and promote ideological revolutionization. In this way, the people's army can be invincible. If the Party's leadership over the military and political work are abolished, it means that Mao Zedong Thought is abolished. This will inevitably disarm our army politically and ideologically. The nature of the people's army will surely change, turning into an army without political consciousness, direction, and soul, becoming a tool of bourgeois dictatorship. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi's abolition of the Party's leadership over the military is an attempt to change the nature of the people's army and sabotage the revolution. His intentions are so malicious!

Our People's Liberation Army is a great army personally created by our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. Vice Chairman Lin holds the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, studies Chairman Mao's works best, and executes Chairman Mao's wise instructions most resolutely, thoroughly, and brilliantly. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that the guns of the proletariat are forever in the hands of the Party. Whoever tries to sell out the revolutionary armed forces and betray the interests of the people, we will resolutely cast them into the eighteen layers of hell, making them never able to rise again!

### 取消党对军队的领导是对革命的背叛

    取消党对军队的领导是对革命的背叛
    济南部队某部政委　王德高
    我们革命战士时刻牢记毛主席的教导：“我们是伟大的人民解放军，是伟大的中国共产党领导的队伍。只要我们时刻遵守党的指示，我们就一定胜利。”抗战胜利后，大叛徒刘少奇在他的大毒草“和平民主新阶段”中，提出什么“我军的支部、党委会、政治委员取消，在军队中取消党的组织……”，还无耻地说：“这种改变是必要的”，“不改不行”。他还胡说：这种改变“丝毫没有改变人民军队的本质，并且会继续提高”。大叛徒刘少奇妄图把军队同党分开，取消党对革命军队的领导，这是对无产阶级革命的可耻背叛！
    在“和平民主新阶段”出笼的前十年，毛主席就明确指出：“在无产阶级已经走上政治舞台的时代，……任何的革命战争如果没有或违背无产阶级和共产党的领导，那个战争是一定要失败的。”正当我国处在两种命运、两种前途决战的关键时刻，大叛徒刘少奇要取消我们党对军队的领导，取消政治委员，取消政治工作制度，就是要抽掉我军的灵魂。实质上是要我们共产党让出对军队的领导权，向蒋介石投降。
    人民的军队必须在中国共产党的绝对领导之下。我军之所以能够代表无产阶级的根本利益，能攻无不克，战无不胜，就是因为有党的领导，有毛泽东思想。我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“人民解放军建立了自己的强有力的革命的政治工作，这是我们战胜敌人的重大因素。”翻开我党我军的历史，哪一次胜利不是由于毛主席的英明领导？哪一次失败挫折不是因为违背了毛泽东思想？
    世界上没有超阶级的军队，一个没有
  “党”领导的军队是不存在的。国民党蒋介石千方百计要我们党放弃对军队的领导。这样，中国就只有国民党掌握军队了。大叛徒刘少奇在抗战胜利后，妄图要我们军队不听党的话，不听毛主席的话，就是为了迎合蒋介石的需要。
    党的领导在军队中的作用，在于保证军队有坚定正确的政治方向，保证毛泽东思想对军队的绝对领导，使我军成为执行党的政治任务的武装集团。政治工作的任务是经常不断地用毛泽东思想武装干部战士的头脑，促进思想革命化。这样，人民军队就能无敌于天下。如果取消了党对军队的领导，取消了政治工作，就是取消了毛泽东思想。这样，势必会从政治上、思想上解除了我军的武装。人民军队的性质就一定会改变，变成一支没有政治头脑、没有方向、没有灵魂的军队，变成资产阶级专政的工具。大叛徒刘少奇取消党对军队的领导，就是妄图改变人民军队的性质，断送革命。其用心多么狠毒！
    我们人民解放军是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造的，林副主席亲自指挥的军队。林副主席毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，毛主席著作学得最好，对毛主席的英明指示执行的最坚决，最彻底，最出色。我们要以林副主席为光辉榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，让无产阶级的枪杆子，永远掌握在党的手里。谁想出卖革命的武装，出卖人民的利益，我们就坚决把他打入十八层地狱，叫他永世不得翻身！
