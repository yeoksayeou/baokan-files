A Live Criticism Session

After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, revolutionary workers at the Tool Factory of the First Automobile Works in Changchun organized an amateur investigation team to further criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. They aimed to smash the "expert-run factory" black goods promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents. They moved over a hundred kinds of obsolete products designed by reactionary technical "authorities" outside the factory, setting up a live criticism session to bombard Liu Shaoqi's "expert-run factory" black goods.

Soon, a unique criticism session began. People gathered in groups of threes and fives towards the venue. In an instant, the venue was surrounded by revolutionary workers holding red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations. Workers, upon seeing the obsolete products on the exhibition platform, were filled with indignation and denounced Liu Shaoqi, the despicable traitor.

"Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!"
"Smash Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises!"

In the midst of angry slogans, the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" were brought into the venue. The battle had begun. Old worker Chen Jinghai pointed to a tool and asked, "What is this for?"

The capitalist-roader lowered his head and replied, "This is a board for scraping grease."

Worker Zhao Yushan said, "This is what your beloved 'noble foreign experts' designed. It's so heavy; it's clearly a whip of the bourgeoisie to oppress workers!"

Old worker Zhuang Hengju pointed to a set of molds that workers had painstakingly processed, and pointing at the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," said, "This is what you designed by locking the door and copying foreign materials. Since it can't be used, it had to be thrown away. You don't feel sorry, but we workers feel the pain in our hearts!"

Suddenly, a powerful voice echoed in everyone's ears: "Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have never believed in foreign frameworks." A young man pointed to a few products on the other side of the exhibition platform and said, "These are products that we workers designed and manufactured after smashing foreign frameworks!"

The venue immediately boiled over. "Down with Liu Shaoqi!" "Smash the revisionist foreign frameworks!" The angry slogans shook the heavens. Faced with ironclad facts, the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" had no choice but to confess their crimes.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." This vivid live criticism session, with ironclad facts, eloquently proves that workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the wisest and most talented, able to overcome any difficulty and create any miracle. After the session, the workers proudly declared: "We, the working class, can lead everything. Let Liu Shaoqi's 'expert-run factory' and 'technology first' black goods go to hell!"

专栏：革命大批判中的小故事

    一次现场批判会
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表以后，长春第一汽车厂工具分厂辅具车间的革命职工，为了继续深入批判大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义谬论，砸烂刘少奇及其代理人推行的“专家治厂”的黑货，组织了一个业余调查组，开展业余调查。他们将反动技术“权威”设计的一百多种报废的产品搬到厂房外，布置了一个重炮猛轰刘少奇“专家治厂”黑货的实物批判会。
    不多久，一个别开生面的批判会开始了。人们三五成群地涌向会场。霎时，会场被手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》的革命职工围个里三层外三层。工人们看到展览台上报废的产品，无不万分愤慨，纷纷痛斥刘少奇这个罪该万死的大坏蛋。
      “打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”
      “砸烂刘少奇‘专家治厂’的反革命修正主义办企业路线！”在一片愤怒的口号声中，走资派、反动技术“权威”被带进了会场。战斗打响了。老工人陈景海指着一件工具质问说：“这是干啥用的？”
    走资派低着脑袋回答：“这是刮黄油的板。”
    工人赵玉山说：“这就是你们宠爱的那些‘高贵的洋权威’设计的，这样笨重，哪里是刮黄油的，分明是资产阶级虐待工人的一条鞭子！”
    老工人庄恒聚指着一套工人好不容易加工出来的模子，指着走资派和反动技术“权威”的鼻子说：“这就是你们关门扒洋资料设计的，因为不能用，只得扔掉了，你们一点不可惜，可是咱们工人却痛在心里啊！”……
    突然，一个宏亮的声音响在大家的耳旁：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级从来就不迷信洋框框。”一个年轻的小伙子指着展览台另一边的几件产品说，“这都是我们工人砸烂洋框框，自己设计和制造的产品！”
    会场上顿时沸腾起来。“打倒刘少奇！”“砸烂修正主义洋框框！”的愤怒的口号声震天动地。在铁的事实面前，走资派、反动技术“权威”不得不低头认罪。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，这个生动的实物批判会，以铁的事实雄辩地说明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级最聪明，最有才能，什么困难都能克服，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。会后，工人们豪迈地说：“我们工人阶级能够领导一切，让中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇的‘专家治厂’、‘技术第一’的黑货见鬼去吧！”
