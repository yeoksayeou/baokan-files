Our town of Shaxi has a population of over 8,000, with 2,800 workers. There is one factory with over 1,000 employees, eleven factories with over 100 employees, and a total of 68 enterprises and institutions. Originally, there were three primary and secondary schools with 152 teachers and staff, and 2,780 students. The town is adjacent to two production brigades of Shaxi Commune. How should the educational revolution be carried out in such a town?

Since September, the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire town, based on studying Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, have all contributed ideas and strategies, reaching a consensus: urban schools must be jointly run by factories and production brigades, and managed by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants.

Urban areas directly serve the vast rural areas and play a bridging role between cities and villages. Some students from the production brigades near the town attend school in the town, which determines that the primary and secondary schools in the town must not only be led by the working class but also managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants. From the perspective of strengthening the relationship between urban and rural areas and consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants, after the joint operation of schools by workers and peasants, it will promote greater unity between workers and peasants, and make both factories and villages good classrooms for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution.

Our specific approach is as follows: the entire town's factories, residents' committees, and production brigades are divided into four districts. Each district establishes an educational revolution leadership group with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants as the core, managing the schools in their respective areas. All major issues in the schools are discussed and decided by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Teachers and students adopt the method of being assigned to specific factories, brigades, workers, and poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in industrial and agricultural labor and receive re-education. They live, work, and criticize bourgeois and revisionist ideas together with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly changing the past phenomenon of schools being dominated by intellectuals, and making teachers become ordinary laborers who are both workers, peasants, and teachers, thoroughly changing the phenomenon of "those who labor with their minds rule over those who labor with their strength."

Following Chairman Mao's instruction to shorten the school system, we have merged primary and secondary schools into two types: seven-year and nine-year schools. Generally, children start school at the age of six, but this can be adjusted based on the child's development without strict uniformity. We have reorganized and rebuilt the teaching staff, establishing a part-time lecturer team of over 200 workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. We have abolished winter and summer vacations, ensuring that more vacations are given during busy times and none during idle times. We have established Red Guards and Little Red Guards organizations, implementing the educational method of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers."

The advantages of urban primary and secondary schools being jointly run by factories and production brigades are:

1. It fundamentally changes the past situation where the education bureau could not manage, the local party committee could not intervene, and factories and production brigades wanted to manage but were not allowed to. It completely changes the situation where central schools dominate primary schools; students in urban schools are directly under the leadership of the working class, learning both cultural knowledge and industrial, agricultural, and military skills, achieving the integration of theory and practice.

2. The power of education is truly returned to the hands of workers and peasants. Schools belong to workers and peasants, ensuring that schools do not separate from politics, the three great revolutionary movements, or productive labor. Because workers and poor and lower-middle peasants care about education, this integrates school education, social education, and family education.

3. After the joint operation of schools by workers and peasants, the layout of schools is adjusted according to needs, changing the past situation of concentrated schools and making it convenient for the children of workers and peasants to attend school nearby.

4. After the joint operation of schools by workers and peasants, the problem of teachers is also solved. Workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, retired workers, and community committee cadres take to the lectern, completely changing the situation where intellectuals dominate everything.

After urban primary and secondary schools are jointly run by factories and production brigades, they are welcomed by the broad masses of laboring people. They unanimously reflect: "Such an educational revolution truly achieves the joint management of education by workers and peasants, everyone participates in the educational revolution, there are people to manage the successors of the proletarian revolution, the school will always be red, the country will not change color, and Mao Zedong Thought will be passed down for generations. This way, we workers and poor and lower-middle peasants can be at ease."

    我们的城镇学校实行了分片管理
    我们沙溪镇有八千多人口，二千八百多名工人。千人以上的工厂有一个，百人以上的工厂十一个，大小企事业单位六十八个。原有三所中小学，一百五十二名教职员工，二千七百八十多名学生。镇附近有沙溪公社的两个大队。象这样的集镇，教育革命应该怎么搞？
    九月以来，全镇工人阶级和贫下中农在学习毛主席的教育革命思想，批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的基础上，个个出主意，人人献计策，得出了共同的意见：城镇学校一定要由工厂、大队联合办，由工人、贫下中农共同来管理学校。
    城镇是直接为广大农村服务的，它起着联系城市和乡村之间的桥梁作用。城镇附近的大队也有一部分学生就近在镇上入学，这就决定了城镇小学和中学不仅要有工人阶级领导，也要有工人阶级最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农参加管理。从密切城乡关系、巩固工农联盟考虑，工农联合办校后，会促进工农更加团结，而且使工厂、农村都成为进行无产阶级教育革命的好课堂。
    我们的具体做法是：全镇的工厂、居民委员会和大队划成四个片，各片建立以工人、贫下中农为核心的教育革命领导小组，分别管理所在地区的学校。学校一切重大问题都由工人、贫下中农讨论决定。师生采取定厂、定队、定工人、定贫下中农的办法，参加工农业劳动和接受再教育。他们和工人、贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同批判资产阶级、同斗私批修，彻底改变了过去学校中知识分子成堆的现象，使教师成为亦工亦农亦教的普通劳动者，彻底改变“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的现象。
    根据毛主席学制要缩短的教导，我们把小学和中学合并，改为七年制和九年制两种学校。一般规定六周岁入学，但可根据儿童发育情况，不强求一律。整顿和重建了教师队伍，建立一支有二百多名工人、贫下中农参加的业余讲师团。取消寒暑假，做到忙时多放假，闲时不放假。建立红卫兵、红小兵组织，实行官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵的教育方法。
    城镇中小学由工厂、大队联合办的好处是：
    一、从根本上改变了过去那种文教局管不了，当地党委管不着，工厂、大队想管又不让管的现象，彻底改变了中心校统治完小的局面；城镇学校学生直接在工人阶级领导下，一边学文，一边学工、学农、学军，做到了理论联系实际。
    二、文权真正夺回到工农手里，学校是工农自己的学校，使学校不脱离政治，不脱离三大革命运动，不脱离生产劳动。由于工人和贫下中农关心教育，这就把学校教育、社会教育和家庭教育结合了起来。
    三、工农联合办校后，按照需要调整了学校布局，改变了过去学校集中的现象，便利工农子女就近入学。
    四、工农联合办校后，教员问题也得到了解决。工人、贫下中农、退休工人、街道居民委员会的干部上讲台，彻底改变了知识分子一统天下的局面。
    城镇中小学由工厂、大队联合办后，受到广大劳动人民的欢迎。他们一致反映：“这样的教育革命，真正做到了文权工农联合抓，教育革命人人搞，无产阶级革命接班人有人管，学校永远红，国家不变色，毛泽东思想传万代。这样我们工人、贫下中农就放心了。”
