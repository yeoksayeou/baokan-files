Wuxi Hemp-Cotton Textile Mill's revolutionary workers, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "economize to make revolution," have fully exercised the leading role of the working class. They have consciously practiced economy in all aspects, managed all affairs with thrift, and thus effectively promoted the development of production.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of this mill, it has always regarded the study, publicity, and implementation of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "economize to make revolution" as a major task for the working class to exercise power properly. All revolutionary workers in the mill have fully displayed the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, thrift, and hard struggle of the working class. They have dug deep into potential and carried out extensive technical innovations. The spinning workshop needed to add a side grinding machine for cover plates to improve the quality and efficiency of grinding cover plates. If a new one were to be bought, it would cost more than 2,000 yuan. The revolutionary workers of this workshop, following Chairman Mao's teaching to "save every copper coin for the cause of war and revolution," searched through all the scrap yards in the mill to find scrap materials. As a result, they only bought 220 screws and two rubber rings, spending about 100 yuan, and made a side grinding machine for cover plates. Not only did they break through the quality bottleneck, but they also increased work efficiency by three times. The revolutionary workers of the cleaning workshop, in order to make a grab bag machine themselves, searched everywhere for scrap materials to substitute. Originally, it was estimated that six tons of steel would be needed, but in the end, only one ton of steel was used to make the grab bag machine, and the quality was completely qualified. After this machine was put into production, it saved one-third of the labor force, and the unevenness of the cotton rolls was reduced from 1% to 0.7%.

In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois "authorities" in the mill still ruled by regulations, creating a situation where different trades minded their own business. Revolutionary workers have reformed unreasonable regulations and institutions, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has greatly increased. To save coal, the boiler workers went out of the boiler room and, together with the fitters, masons, and plumbers, formed an "attack team." They installed a preheater in the boiler flue, using hot smoke to pass through the preheater, turning the boiler's cold water into hot water. In this way, the mill saves more than 15 tons of coal every month. (Accompanying photo)

The soldiers of the 3228 unit's boiler room firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of economizing to make revolution, with red hearts and warm fires, striving hard, and burning coal thriftily, creating the great achievement of saving 200 catty of coal every day compared to last year.

    无锡麻棉纺织厂在毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示指引下
    厉行节约有力促进生产发展
    据新华社南京十九日电　无锡麻棉纺织厂广大革命职工，在伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的光辉指示指引下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，自觉地在各个方面厉行节约，勤俭办一切事业，有力地促进了生产的发展。
    这个厂的革委会成立后，始终把学习、宣传、贯彻毛主席“要节约闹革命”的光辉指示，作为工人阶级掌好权、用好权的一件大事来抓。全厂革命职工充分发挥了工人阶级自力更生、勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，狠挖潜力，大搞技术革新。棉纺车间钢丝车需要添置一台盖板侧磨机，以提高磨盖板质量和效率。如果买一台新的要花两千多元。这个车间革命职工遵循毛主席“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”的教导，跑遍了全厂的废料间，去寻找废料，结果只买了二百二十个螺丝和两个皮圈，花了一百元左右，就将一台盖板侧磨机造了出来，不仅突破了质量关，并且把工效提高了三倍。棉纺车间清花间革命职工，为了自己制造一台抓包机，大家到处寻找废旧料代用，原来预计需要六吨钢材，结果只用了一吨钢材，就把抓包机制成了，质量完全合格。这台机器投产后使劳动力节约了三分之一，棉卷不匀率由百分之一降低为百分之零点七。
    过去，厂里一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”，还以制度治人，在不同的工种之间造成了各管各的现象。广大革命职工改革了不合理的规章制度，革命积极性大大提高。为了节约用煤，司炉工跑出锅炉间，和钳工、泥工、水管工一起组成“攻坚战斗组”，在锅炉烟道中安装了预热箱，利用热烟通过预热箱，使锅炉进水由冷水变为热水。这样，全厂每月就节约用煤十五吨以上。（附图片）
    三二二八部队锅炉房战士，坚决执行毛主席要节约闹革命的伟大方针，心红火旺，艰苦奋斗，勤俭烧煤，创造出比去年每天节省煤炭二百斤的巨大成绩。
