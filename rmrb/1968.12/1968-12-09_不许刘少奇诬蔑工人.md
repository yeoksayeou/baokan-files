Title: Do Not Allow Liu Shaoqi to Slander Workers

Our great leader of the working class, Chairman Mao, has pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." Chairman Mao's instructions are the greatest encouragement and spur for us, the working class. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must strive for Chairman Mao and for the working class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. We must continuously raise our political consciousness in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor to the workers, is most afraid of and hates the working class the most. Not only did he, on the eve of national liberation, contemptuously compare us, the working class, to a "broken chair," but as early as the initial period of the democratic revolution, he maliciously cursed us, the working class, saying that "among the Chinese working class, there is a rather thick guild mentality and hooliganism." Pfft! This is a great slander against the working class. We must thoroughly criticize and expose this counter-revolutionary fallacy!

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Only the proletariat and the Communist Party have the least narrow-mindedness and selfishness, the greatest political foresight, and the greatest organizational ability." The Chinese working class has suffered the most and been oppressed the heaviest. We deeply understand that only by closely uniting the entire class can we overthrow the counter-revolutionary rule of the three great enemies, liberate all of China, and achieve our own liberation. Therefore, as soon as the Chinese working class stepped onto the political stage, we closely united around our vanguard, the Communist Party of China, loudly shouted the slogan "Workers of the world, unite!" and resolutely opposed sectarianism, factionalism, and cliquism. We resolutely opposed the guild mentality that undermines the unity of the working class. We, the working class, are the most united in class, the most friendly in class, and the most considerate of the overall interests of the class. Without the strong leadership of the working class and the close unity of the working class, it would have been impossible for the Chinese revolution to achieve victory.

Because of the working class's position of being oppressed and exploited, and because the working class is connected with large-scale machine production, it is determined that the working class has the highest political consciousness, the most steadfast revolutionary nature, the greatest organizational ability and discipline, the most selflessness, and the most communist morality. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Only the working class has the greatest foresight, the most selflessness, the most thorough revolutionary spirit." These advantages of the working class determine that the working class has always been the most vigorous revolutionary main force in the history of the Chinese revolution. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the working class has played the role of the main force and the leading class. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered Tsinghua University, we resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely opposed the hypocritical bourgeois style, resolutely opposed the destruction of public property, and resolutely opposed armed struggles. In just a few months, under the guidance and leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the revolutionary youth in Tsinghua University seriously implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, thoroughly criticized the reactionary "multi-center means no center" theory, swept away the evil winds, and decided to accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In fact, "guild mentality and hooliganism" are precisely the class characteristics of the landlord bourgeoisie. Liu Shaoqi is a loyal running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. He possesses the most reactionary "guild mentality and hooliganism." It is he who, within the working class, played counter-revolutionary two-faced tricks, recruited traitors, formed cliques, and assembled a bourgeois command department, openly opposing the proletarian command department led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. It is he who, within the revolutionary ranks, played hooligan tricks, engaged in deception, and while being a thorough traitor, pretended to be a "leader of the workers' movement" and a "veteran revolutionary" who fought to the death. Ironclad historical facts have proven that Liu Shaoqi is the biggest political hooligan and a thorough counter-revolutionary.

Liu Shaoqi, on the one hand, maliciously slandered us, the working class, as having "a rather thick guild mentality and hooliganism," and on the other hand, he extolled the bourgeoisie, dressing them up as "red capitalists," and wanted us workers to "learn from them" and "worship them as teachers." Why is this? In a word, he wants to cancel the leading position of the working class, cancel the dictatorship of the proletariat, and let the bourgeoisie ride on our necks again and implement dictatorship over us. An ant climbing a locust tree boasts of its greatness, and a beetle shaking a tree is impossible. Liu Shaoqi's dream of canceling the leading position of the working class and the dictatorship of the proletariat has already completely shattered in the great, decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    不许刘少奇诬蔑工人
    驻清华大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队　张同娟
    我们工人阶级的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席的指示是对我们工人阶级最大的鼓舞和鞭策。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们为毛主席争气，为工人阶级争气，要在无产阶级文化大革命和一切工作中，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用。我们要在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，不断提高自己的政治觉悟。
    刘少奇这个大工贼，最怕我们工人阶级，也最恨我们工人阶级。他不仅在全国解放的前夕，轻蔑地把我们工人阶级比作“破椅子”，而且早在民主革命初期，就恶毒地咒骂我们工人阶级，胡说什么“在中国工人阶级中，有比较浓厚的行会性与流氓性。”呸！这是对我们工人阶级的极大诬蔑，我们一定要把这种反革命谬论批倒批臭！
    毛主席早就指出：“只有无产阶级和共产党，才最没有狭隘性和自私自利性，最有远大的政治眼光和最有组织性。”中国工人阶级受苦最深，受压迫最重。我们深深懂得，只有把整个阶级最紧密地团结起来，才能推翻三大敌人的反革命统治，解放全中国，求得自身的解放。因此，我们中国工人阶级一走上政治舞台，就紧密地团结在自己的先锋队中国共产党的周围，最响亮地喊出“全世界无产者，联合起来”的口号，最坚决地反对宗派主义、山头主义和小团体主义，最坚决地反对破坏工人阶级团结的行会思想。我们工人阶级是最讲阶级的团结，最讲阶级的友谊，最照顾整个阶级的整体利益的。如果没有工人阶级的坚强领导，没有工人阶级的紧密团结，中国革命要取得胜利是根本不可能的。
    由于工人阶级受压迫受剥削的阶级地位，由于工人阶级和大机器生产连在一起，就决定我们工人阶级最有政治觉悟，最有坚定的革命性，最有组织性和纪律性，最大公无私，最有共产主义道德。正如毛主席所指出的那样：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”我们工人阶级的这些优点，就决定我们工人阶级在中国革命的历史上，从来就是一支最生气蓬勃的革命主力军。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，更是发挥了主力军和领导阶级的作用。我们首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队进入清华园以后，就最坚决地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决反对言行不一的资产阶级作风，坚决反对破坏公共财物，坚决反对武斗。在短短的几个月内，在首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助与领导下，清华园的革命小将认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，彻底批判反动的“多中心即无中心论”，扫清了歪风邪气，决心接受工农兵的再教育。
    事实上，“行会性与流氓性”正是地主资产阶级的阶级特性。刘少奇是帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗，他才具有最反动的“行会性与流氓性”。就是他，在工人阶级内部大耍反革命两面派手法，招降纳叛，结党营私，拼凑资产阶级司令部，公然对抗以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。就是他，在革命队伍中大耍流氓手段，进行招摇撞骗，自己是地地道道的大工贼，却硬要说成是“工人运动的领袖”，自己是确确实实的大叛徒，却硬是装扮成出生入死的“老革命”。铁的历史事实已经证明，刘少奇是最大的政治流氓，彻头彻尾的反革命。
    刘少奇一方面恶毒地诬蔑我们工人阶级“有比较浓厚的行会性与流氓性”，另一方面却又极力美化资产阶级，把他们打扮成“红色资本家”，要我们工人向他们“学习”，拜他们为“老师”。这是为什么呢？说穿了，他就是妄图取消工人阶级的领导地位，取消无产阶级专政，让资产阶级重新骑在我们的脖子上，对我们实行专政。蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。刘少奇妄图取消工人阶级领导地位、取消无产阶级专政的黄粱美梦，在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的、决定性胜利的凯歌声中，已经彻底破灭。
