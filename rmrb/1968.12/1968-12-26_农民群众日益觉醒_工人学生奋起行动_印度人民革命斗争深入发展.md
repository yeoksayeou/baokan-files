Throughout this year, the revolutionary people of India have continued to wage a broad and deep struggle against the Indian reactionaries and their masters, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. In the course of their struggle, they have been constantly summing up their experiences, consolidating their forces, and accumulating strength. They have frequently taken advantage of favorable opportunities to strike heavy blows at the Indian reactionaries, causing them to panic.

The spread of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has been widespread in India over the past year. Indian revolutionaries, in conjunction with the actual situation in India, have emphasized the need for the Indian people to take the revolutionary road of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle. They have forcefully criticized the Indian Communist Party revisionists and the Danji traitor clique for using the "parliamentary road" to lull the Indian people into complacency.

Indian revolutionaries have translated and published a large number of Chairman Mao's brilliant works and have published Mao's works and quotations in revolutionary periodicals. They have spread revolutionary truth to the broad masses of the Indian people, especially to the impoverished working people who have suffered the most brutal oppression and exploitation. According to Indian newspapers, in some areas of the Chotanagpur region of Bihar State, where people have lived for generations, many peasants can recite quotations from Chairman Mao.

This year, Indian revolutionaries have also widely used the method of secretly writing large-character posters and distributing leaflets to spread revolutionary truth to the people. In the vast rural areas and many towns of India, more and more revolutionary slogans have appeared on the walls: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "Without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything." "Revolution relies on bullets, not on ballots!" "Boycott elections!" "Long live violent revolution!" "Armed struggle, yes, yes!" "Down with the American imperialists!" "Red salute to Nasalbari!" "Only by smashing the bourgeois state machine can liberation be achieved!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"

In mid-November, a large-character poster appeared on the wall near the international airport at Dumdum in Calcutta: "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" On the night of December 17, revolutionaries filled the walls of a small street in Bombay, India's second-largest city, with revolutionary slogans such as "Down with elections!"

These actions by the Indian revolutionary faction have dealt a heavy blow to the Indian reactionaries. On December 20, the Indian Minister of the Interior, Chavan, shouted in the parliament that laws should be enacted to carry out savage suppression.

Indian revolutionaries are striving to combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice of India, emphasizing the importance of going deep into the countryside, mobilizing the peasants, and waging revolutionary struggles. In summing up the past experiences of rural work, they have pointed out the importance of conducting rural investigations and using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to conduct class analysis. They have pointed out that this is a necessary method to distinguish between friends and enemies and to solve the primary problem of the revolution. An article on rural investigation published in the Indian weekly "Patriot" uses a large number of facts to expose the extremely cruel feudal exploitation in Indian villages and refutes the fallacy of modern revisionists that Indian villages have been "capitalized."

As the Indian peasant masses become more and more awakened, the armed resistance and land seizure struggles of Indian revolutionary peasants have risen and fallen in various parts of India. The people in West Bengal and Nasalbari continue to fight. In addition, in February, peasants in the Srikakulam region of Andhra Pradesh used muzzleloaders and bows and arrows to attack reactionary soldiers and police several times. In July, five thousand peasants in the northern part of Uttar Pradesh reclaimed more than twenty thousand acres of land from the landlords. In August, peasants in Muzzafarpur County, Bihar, bravely defeated the attack of the landlord's armed forces and police, controlling a region for three days.

Recently, the Indian reactionary government had to issue a proclamation, urging all state governments to strengthen the intelligence agencies and strengthen the suppression of revolutionary peasants. They must quickly send police to the affected areas, and the central government can assist in suppression if necessary. On December 5, the Minister of the Interior, Chavan, panickedly announced in the parliament that, in addition to West Bengal, Indian revolutionaries are very active in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, the northern part of Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. He shouted hysterically that he must deal with this "threat that cannot be taken lightly."

No matter how desperately the Indian reactionaries struggle, the nearly four hundred million Indian peasants, who are suffering deeply, will rise up to fight and break the shackles on their bodies. This historical trend is unstoppable by any reactionary force.

This year, the waves of struggle by Indian workers, students, and teachers have continued to impact the Indian reactionary rule. In September, a general strike by government employees, including broad masses of railway and postal workers, reached an unprecedented scale, with four million people participating. It directly and forcefully struck the Indian central government. By the end of the year, the waves of struggle by students and teachers had spread to several states. This year, even workers in newspapers, who had rarely participated in strikes in the past, have been on strike for two months to demand wage increases.

This year, the struggle of the urban people in India has become increasingly clear in its direct targeting of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indian reactionary rulers. When former U.S. Secretary of Defense and World Bank President McNamara visited India in November, citizens of Calcutta held large-scale anti-American demonstrations, frightening McNamara into leaving the international airport by helicopter. In September, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique sent a delegation to hold talks with the Indian reactionary government in New Delhi. Revolutionary people in the capital hung up many banners saying "New colonialists, get out!" condemning the Soviet revisionists' plundering of the Indian people. In addition, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Deputy Prime Minister Desai have been surrounded by angry crowds several times this year, who pelted these reactionary leaders with bricks and stones to express their deep hatred for the reactionary rule.

The urban people of India have shown courage and tenacity in their struggles. The weak Indian reactionary government has completely revealed its fascist, savage face when dealing with the general strike of government employees, killing ten strikers and imprisoning ten thousand people. It also dismissed or suspended more than ten thousand people. However, postal and other department workers continued to fight against the reactionary government in various ways, with slowdowns and "slow work" activities continuing for more than a month after the general strike, making the Indian reactionaries very embarrassed.

Under the impact of the waves of struggle by the Indian people, the internal and external difficulties of the Indian reactionary rule are increasing. As pointed out in an article in the November issue of the Indian revolutionary magazine "Liberation": "The ruling class has fallen deeper into political and economic crises than ever before. Their economy, a subsidiary of imperialism, is suffering from an incurable fatal disease." "As the contradictions between the people and the exploiting class become sharper, the Congress Party can no longer deceive the people with economic plans or empty talk of building socialism. It is itself split into factions. Within the ruling class, different factions and parties that rely on U.S. and British imperialism or rely on Soviet neo-colonialism are fighting each other like dogs. Their struggles for power and for excessive profits among themselves and with their masters have made the political crisis even more acute."

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Indian nation is a great nation, and the Indian people are a good people." The Indian reactionaries and their masters, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, are all paper tigers. The Indian people will surely achieve thorough liberation through their own struggles!

    农民群众日益觉醒　工人学生奋起行动
    印度人民革命斗争深入发展
    新华社二十四日讯本社记者报道：今年来，印度革命人民继续广泛深入地开展反对印度反动派及其主子美帝苏修的英勇斗争。他们在斗争中不断总结经验，整顿队伍，积蓄力量，并且经常利用有利时机，狠狠地打击印度反动派，使印度反动派十分惊慌。传播革命真理点燃革命火种
    一年来，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想在印度各地有了广泛传播。印度革命者结合印度的实际情况，着重宣传印度人民要走农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的革命道路。他们有力地批判了印共修正主义分子和丹吉叛徒集团用来麻痹印度人民的“议会道路”。
    印度革命者大量翻译、出版毛主席的光辉著作，并且在革命刊物上刊载毛主席著作和语录。他们向印度广大人民群众，特别是受到最残暴的压迫和剥削的贫苦劳动人民，传播革命真理。据印度报纸透露，在一些世世代代居住在比哈尔邦乔塔那格浦尔地区的农民中，许多人会背诵毛主席语录。
    今年内，印度革命者还广泛使用秘密地写大字标语和张贴传单的办法，向人民传播革命真理。在印度广大农村和许多市镇的墙壁上，越来越多地出现了各种革命标语：“枪杆子里面出政权”“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”“革命靠枪弹，不靠选票！”“抵制选举！”“暴力革命万岁！”“武装斗争，对，对！”“打倒美国佬！”“向纳萨尔巴里致红色的敬礼！”“只有打碎资产阶级的国家机器才能获得解放！”“毛泽东万岁！”十一月间，在加尔各答的达姆达姆国际机场附近的墙上，出现一条大字标语：“毛泽东同志万岁！”十二月十七日夜间，在印度第二大城市孟买的一条小街的墙壁上，革命者写满了“打倒选举！”等革命标语。印度革命派的这些行动，沉重地打击了印度反动派。印度内政部长恰范十二月二十日在议会上叫嚷要制订法律，进行疯狂镇压。深入发动农民展开夺地抗暴
    印度革命者正在努力把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同印度革命实践相结合，重视深入农村，发动农民，进行革命斗争。他们在总结过去农村工作的经验中，指出进行农村调查，运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想进行阶级分析的重要意义，指出这是分清敌我、解决革命的首要问题所必须采取的办法。印度《爱国者》周刊发表的一篇农村调查，用大量事实揭露了印度农村中极其残酷的封建剥削，驳倒了现代修正主义分子所谓印度农村已经“资本主义化”的谬论。
    随着印度农民群众的日益觉醒，印度革命农民的武力抗暴斗争和夺地斗争此伏彼起地在印度各地展开。西孟加拉邦纳萨尔巴里等地人民继续在坚持斗争。此外，二月间，安得拉邦斯里卡库兰地区的农民使用土枪、弓箭，多次袭击反动军警。七月，北方邦北部五千名农民从地主手中夺回了两万多英亩土地。八月，比哈尔邦穆扎法普尔县的农民英勇打败了地主武装和警察的进攻，把一个地区控制了三天之久。
    最近，印度反动政府不得不发表公告，要全国各邦政府加强特务机构，对革命农民加强镇压措施，要它们尽快把警察派到出事地区，必要时中央政府可以帮忙镇压。内政部长恰范十二月五日在议会中惊慌地宣布，除了西孟加拉邦外，在北方邦东部、比哈尔邦北部、安得拉邦和喀拉拉邦，印度革命者都很活跃，他声嘶力竭地叫喊要对付这个“不容轻视的威胁”。
    不管印度反动派怎样疯狂挣扎，印度近四亿苦难深重的农民总是要起来斗争，挣脱他们身上的镣铐的。这个历史的潮流，任何反动势力都是阻挡不住的。城市人民奋起猛击反动统治
    今年来，印度工人、学生和教员的斗争浪潮继续冲击着印度反动统治。九月间，包括铁路、邮电部门广大职工在内的政府雇员举行大罢工，四百万人参加，达到了空前的规模，而且比以往任何一次政府雇员大罢工更加直接、有力地打击了印度中央政府。年底，学生和教员的斗争浪潮，波及好几个邦。今年来，连过去很少参加罢工的各地报馆的职工，也为了要求增加工资，坚持罢工斗争达两个月之久。
    今年，印度城市人民的斗争矛头，越来越鲜明地直接指向美帝、苏修和印度反动统治者。当美国前国防部长、世界银行行长麦克纳马拉十一月间到印度活动时，加尔各答市民举行大规模的反美示威，吓得麦克纳马拉乘直升飞机离开国际机场。苏修叛徒集团九月间派代表团同印度反动政府在新德里举行会谈，印度首都革命人民在市内外挂出了许多“新殖民主义者滚回去！”的标语，谴责苏修掠夺印度人民。此外，印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地和副总理德赛，今年内曾几次被愤怒的群众所包围，群众用砖头石块猛揍这些反动头目，来表示他们对反动统治的深仇大恨。
    印度城市人民在斗争中表现了勇敢顽强的战斗精神。虚弱的印度反动政府在对付政府雇员的大罢工时，完全露出了一副法西斯的凶残面目，开枪打死罢工群众十人，把一万人投入监狱，还把一万多人开除或停职。但是，邮电等部门的职工继续采取多种方式同反动政府作斗争，怠工和“放慢工作”的活动一直持续到大罢工后一个多月，使印度反动派十分狼狈。人民英勇斗争反动派定灭亡
    在印度人民斗争浪潮的冲击下，内外交困的印度反动统治越来越不稳。正象印度革命刊物《解放》月刊十一月号发表的一篇文章所指出的：印度“统治阶级已经比以往更深地陷入政治经济危机，他们的经济——帝国主义经济的附属品——患了致命的不治之症。”“随着人民同剥削阶级的矛盾越来越尖锐，国大党已经很难再用经济计划或建设社会主义的空谈来欺骗人民了。它自己内部也四分五裂。在统治阶级内部，投靠美英帝国主义或者投靠苏联新殖民主义者的不同派系和政党之间，正在狗咬狗地混战。它们自己之间和它们的主子之间争权夺势和争夺超额利润的斗争，使政治危机变得更加尖锐了。”
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“印度民族是伟大的民族，印度人民是很好的人民。”印度反动派以及它们的主子美帝、苏修，统统是纸老虎。印度人民通过自己的斗争，必将得到彻底解放！
