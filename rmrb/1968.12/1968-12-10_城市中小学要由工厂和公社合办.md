We feel that having factories alone run urban primary and secondary schools is not sufficient. This is because the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor have not yet been eliminated. The poisonous influence of the revisionist educational line that emphasizes heavy industry over agriculture, cities over the countryside, and upper levels over the base levels has not been thoroughly eradicated. Among intellectuals, the tendency to shun hardship and seek comfort is still quite serious. Therefore, we believe that urban primary and secondary schools should be jointly run by factories and communes. Our school has already made some explorations and trials in this regard. We have established a farming branch school in Metia Village, Huangdu Commune, Jiading County; and we are setting up an industrial branch school in the original factory of the worker propaganda team stationed at our school—the No. 1 Steel Plant of Shanghai. Revolutionary teachers and students regularly go to these branch schools to study and receive re-education from the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants.

From our practice, we feel that having urban primary and secondary schools jointly run by factories and communes has many advantages. Students, with learning as their main task, can learn industrial skills in factories and agricultural skills in the countryside, thus better combining theory with practice. At the same time, this is conducive to implementing the "four orientations" education. After urban primary and secondary schools are jointly run by factories and communes, students not only receive re-education from the working class but also from the poor and lower-middle peasants, which can better cultivate in students a love for the countryside and remove mental obstacles to going to the countryside to become ordinary laborers.

    城市中小学要由工厂和公社合办
    我们感到城市小学和中学单由工厂来办还不行。因为，目前工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别还没有消灭，重工轻农、重城市轻农村、重上层轻基层的修正主义教育路线的流毒还远远没有肃清，知识分子中怕艰苦和贪图安逸的思想还相当严重。因此，我们认为，城市的小学和中学应由工厂和公社合办。我们学校已在这方面作了一些探索和试点。我们在嘉定县黄渡公社顾家大队建立了一个学农分校；还在进驻我校的工人宣传队的原厂——上钢一厂筹建学工分校。革命师生定期到分校进行学习，接受工人阶级和贫下中农的再教育。
    从实践中，我们感到城市小学和中学由工厂和公社合办，好处很多。学生以学为主，既在工厂学工，也到农村学农，这样就可以更好地使理论与实际结合起来。同时，也有利于对学生进行“四个面向”的教育。城市小学和中学由工厂和公社合办后，学生不仅接受工人阶级的再教育，而且接受贫下中农的再教育，就可以更好地培养学生热爱农村，为到农村去当一个普通劳动者扫除思想障碍。
