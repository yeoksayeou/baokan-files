Yi Lili, a graduate of the ninth grade from the Thirteenth Middle School in Benxi, declared at the graduation ceremony that she would be the first to settle down in the countryside. Soon, her request was approved. However, when it came time to leave the city where she had lived for over a decade, Lili felt a pang of reluctance. She thought to herself, "Dad and Mom go to work, and I cook at home—isn't that also serving the people? It's not like I'm just eating idly in the city!" As batch after batch of her classmates left for the countryside, Lili remained at home.

Lili's parents are both veteran cadres. During the intense battles of the past, they seemed to have little time for their children; but after moving to the city, with better living conditions and higher salaries, they began to indulge their child. Coupled with the revisionist education at the old school, the child became more spoiled and lazy, and the revolutionary traditions of the older generation were rarely seen in her. When Lili's parents heard that their daughter had been assigned to a rural area, they were happy. But upon further thought, they felt uneasy about their daughter, who had grown up by their side, going off to the countryside alone.

Chairman Mao recently instructed, "We must persuade cadres and other people in cities to send their children who have finished middle school, college, or university to the countryside. The rural comrades in various places should welcome them." Just as Lili's thoughts were wavering and her parents were hesitant, they suddenly received a letter. The letter was from an unfamiliar place and was signed collectively; the words were few but heartfelt. Inside were three treasures: the first was a shining badge of Chairman Mao; the second was a red copy of the "Little Red Book"; the third was a small cloth bag filled with grains.

It turned out that Lili had been assigned to a remote production brigade in Chaoyang County. Upon hearing the news, the poor and lower-middle peasants prepared to welcome her warmly. They had prepared a room and a bed, eagerly awaiting Lili's arrival as if she were their own child. When they discovered that Lili had fallen behind, they were worried. They said, "The roots are good, the seedlings are good, it's up to us poor and lower-middle peasants to cultivate them!" The poor and lower-middle peasants decided collectively to write a joint letter, warmly welcoming Yi Lili to join them. They sent a badge of Chairman Mao, hoping that Lili would have a heart that shines towards the sun, forever following Chairman Mao in revolution; they sent a copy of the "Little Red Book," hoping that Lili would read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words; they sent a bag of grains, hoping that Lili would grow and be tempered in the vast countryside.

The words of the poor and lower-middle peasants dispelled the worries of Lili's parents. They said, "Parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer; the river is deep, the sea is deep, but class love is the deepest. The poor and lower-middle peasants all over the country are our most reliable friends. We can rest assured handing our children over to the poor and lower-middle peasants!"

The letter from the poor and lower-middle peasants also gave Lili a profound lesson. She said, "The expectations of the poor and lower-middle peasants are my greatest motivation. These teachers I have never met have already given me the most vivid first lesson. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and settle down in the countryside!"

That night, Yi Lili wore the shining badge of Chairman Mao, carried the precious book, and set off with a radiant demeanor towards the vast countryside.

    贫下中农一封来信
    ——记本溪市十三中易莉莉到农村落户
    本溪市十三中学初三毕业生易莉莉，在毕业典礼会上，第一个表示要到农村安家落户。不久，便被批准了。但真的要离开生活了十几年的城市，莉莉却有点留恋。心想：爸爸、妈妈上班，我在家里做饭，也是为人民服务嘛，算不得在城市里吃闲饭！就这样，一批批下乡的同学都走了，莉莉却依然呆在家里。
    莉莉的爸爸、妈妈都是老干部。在炮火连天的战斗岁月里，似乎没有把孩子放在心上；但进城以后，生活条件好了，薪水多了，对孩子也娇惯起来。加上旧学校对孩子进行修正主义教育，孩子越来越娇了、越懒了，老一辈的革命传统在孩子身上看到的少了。莉莉的爸爸和妈妈听说女儿分配到农村，心里很高兴。可是再一想，从小在身边长大的女儿一个人到农村去，还总有点不大放心。
    毛主席最近教导说：“要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”正在易莉莉思想有反复，父母有顾虑的时候，突然接到一封来信。这封信地点生疏，落款是集体联名；文字不长，却情深似海。信中装有三件宝：第一件是金光闪闪的毛主席像章；第二件是红彤彤的“老五篇”；第三件是装满五谷的小布袋。
    原来，易莉莉分配到朝阳县一个边远的生产队，贫下中农闻讯后，准备热烈欢迎。把房间、床位都准备好了，象盼望自己的孩子一样，盼望莉莉赶快来落户。当他们发现莉莉掉了队，都很担心，他们说：“根是好根，苗是好苗，就靠咱贫下中农来栽培啦！”贫下中农研究决定，集体写一封联名信，热情欢迎易莉莉归队。他们寄一枚毛主席像章，希望莉莉一颗红心向太阳，永远跟着毛主席干革命；寄一本“老五篇”，希望莉莉读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话；寄一包五谷，希望莉莉到农村广阔的天地里锻炼成长。
    贫下中农的一席话，解开了莉莉的爸爸、妈妈心上的疙瘩。他们说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如阶级友爱深，天下贫下中农都是我们最可靠的亲友，把孩子交给贫下中农，我们就一百个放心啦！”
    贫下中农的信，也使莉莉受到一次深刻的教育，她说：“贫下中农对我的期望，是对我最大的鞭策，这些没见面的老师，已经给我上了最生动的第一课。我一定听毛主席的话，到农村去安家落户！”
    当天晚上，易莉莉戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章，怀揣宝书，英姿焕发地奔向农村广阔的天地。　（红革兵　溪军通）
