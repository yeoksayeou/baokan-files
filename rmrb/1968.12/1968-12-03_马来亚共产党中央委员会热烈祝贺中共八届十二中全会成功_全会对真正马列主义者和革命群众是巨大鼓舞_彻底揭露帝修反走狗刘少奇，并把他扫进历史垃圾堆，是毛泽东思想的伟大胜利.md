The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party warmly congratulates the success of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC. The plenary session is a great encouragement to all genuine Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary masses. Thoroughly exposing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, who is a lackey of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, and sweeping him into the dustbin of history, is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

	Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on November 7th, warmly congratulating the successful conclusion of the 8th Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The telegram pointed out that this plenary session is a major event of great historical significance to the world revolution. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, dear comrades:

	We are delighted to learn that the 8th Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has successfully concluded. On behalf of all members of the Malayan Communist Party, all officers and soldiers of the Malayan National Liberation Army, and the revolutionary people of Malaya, we extend our warmest congratulations to you.

	Under the great and decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the new situation where the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has entered a new phase, the 8th Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong, is a major event of great historical significance to the world revolution. The success of the plenary session is a great encouragement to Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary masses in all countries, and a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries in all countries.

	The plenary session unanimously passed a resolution to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, who is notorious for his crimes, from the party forever, and to revoke all his positions within and outside the party, and to continue to expose his counter-revolutionary crimes. This not only expresses the revolutionary demands of the 700 million Chinese people but also expresses the common aspirations of our party, our country's revolutionary people, and all genuine Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in the world. Exposing the true face of Liu Shaoqi, who has committed heinous crimes against the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and sweeping him into the dustbin of history, is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great victory for the international communist movement.

	The publication of the communiqué of the plenary session, which is illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought, will surely lead the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to complete victory, further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, promote the struggle of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys, and open up a more brilliant prospect for the world revolution.

	Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live the great teacher and great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

	Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party

	November 7, 1968
