The revolutionary workers of the Capital Iron and Steel Company have firmly carried out the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production." Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee in September this year, they have persistently carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, used revolution to guide production, and made the production of main products such as pig iron, steel, steel products, cast iron pipes, and concentrate powder increase month by month, setting new production records continuously.

In the steelmaking plant of this company, a very lively and vigorous scene of advance has emerged. Now, the working class has taken hold of the leadership, and the steelworkers have broken away from various unreasonable rules and regulations, doubling the daily output of converter steel. Since August, the production volume has been increasing month by month, and the steel output in November was four times that of August. With a sense of responsibility as the leading class, they have, according to the needs of national economic construction, successfully smelted more than ten new types of steel, including chromium-niobium steel, cold-rolled silicon steel, and bearing steel in just three months, providing important materials for mining machinery and electrical machinery industries.

To organize steel production, it is necessary to focus on the construction of the raw material base—the mines. The workers of the Qian'an Iron Mine have organized themselves to survey and design while crossing mountains and valleys every day, boldly putting forward new suggestions. The revolutionary committee of the mine adopted the suggestions of the old workers and immediately organized a three-in-one investigation team consisting of workers, technicians, and cadres to review and revise the construction plan for the new mining area, shortening the construction time for the new mining area from two and a half years to about half a year.

The revolutionary workers of the comprehensive engineering company, after fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the backwardness of the masses," accepted the task of overhauling the main rolling mill of the rolling mill plant, which they had never undertaken before, with high spirits. The workers of the machinery factory, considering the increase in steel varieties next year and the need for a large number of rolling rolls for the production of new steel materials in the rolling mill plant, recently designed and successfully manufactured a precise large lathe on their own. The ironmaking plant, coking plant, sintering plant, and welding pipe plant and other units have also completed the overhaul of their main equipment one after another in recent times.

In order to achieve new victories in production next year, the revolutionary workers of many other departments of this company have launched a mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and have achieved many significant achievements. Under the good situation of revolution and production, this company is now formulating the production plan for next year.

    首钢连续创造生产新纪录
    广大革命职工正在积极为明年生产跃进作准备
    据新华社讯　首都钢铁公司广大革命职工坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，在今年九月份成立革命委员会以来，坚持深入开展革命大批判，以革命统帅生产，使生铁、钢、钢材、铸铁管、精矿粉等主要产品产量逐月上升，连续创造了新的生产纪录。
    在这个公司的炼钢厂，一个极其生动的跃进局面已经出现。现在，工人阶级掌握了领导大权，炼钢工人们破除了各种不合理的规章制度，使转炉钢的日产量翻了一番。从八月以来，产量月月上升，十一月份的钢产量比八月份增长了四倍。他们以领导阶级的责任感，根据国家经济建设的需要，只用三个月的时间，就成功地冶炼出铬铌钢、冷轧矽钢、滚珠轴承钢等十多个新钢种，为采掘机械和电机工业提供了重要材料。
    组织钢铁生产，必须抓好原料基地——矿山的建设。这个公司迁安铁矿职工自动组织起来，每天翻山越岭，一边勘测，一边设计，大胆地提出新建议。矿区革委会采纳了老工人的建议，立即组织工人、技术人员和干部三结合调查小组，重新审查并修改了新采区建设计划，使新采区建设时间从两年半缩短到半年左右。
    综合工程公司的革命职工在狠批了刘少奇的“群众落后论”以后，斗志昂扬地接受了他们过去从未承担过的轧钢厂主要轧机的大修任务。机械厂工人考虑到明年钢种增加，轧钢厂生产新钢材需要大量轧辊，最近自己动手设计并制造成功了精密的大型车床。炼铁厂、焦化厂、烧结厂、焊结管厂等单位，也都在最近先后完成了主要设备的检修工作。
    为了夺取明年生产的新胜利，这个公司其他许多部门的革命职工掀起了群众性的技术革新、技术革命运动，并且取得了不少重大成就。在革命和生产的大好形势下，这个公司正在着手制订明年的生产计划。
