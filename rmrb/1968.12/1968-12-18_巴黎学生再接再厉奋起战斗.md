	French youth tempered by the revolutionary storm are not intimidated or subdued.
	Paris students continue to fight on relentlessly.

	Students from the Nanterre Faculty of Letters, who played a leading role in the revolutionary struggle, bravely resist police suppression and continue their fight, garnering support from a wide range of French students. The student movement is now spreading to other schools and cities.

	Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: Paris reports that students from the Nanterre Faculty of Letters at Paris University, who played a leading role in the people's revolutionary storm that swept France in May and June, have recently launched a new wave of struggles against the corrupt educational system and government suppression of student movements.

	On the 16th, over 1,500 students held a meeting inside the Nanterre Faculty of Letters, which was surrounded by a large number of police in the Paris suburbs. They decided to continue their strike to protest the French government's unreasonable arrests and interrogations of students. Students held demonstrations within the campus, shouting angrily, "Down with police suppression!" "Police, get out!" A large number of students also rushed out of the school gates, knocking down the barriers set up by the police around the campus.

	The struggle at Nanterre Faculty of Letters began last week. On the 13th, thousands of students from this faculty began a strike, demanding that the government cancel the unreasonable interrogations of students and release their arrested classmates. For nearly a week, they have been persistently fighting. They established leadership groups for the strike, held multiple meetings and demonstrations within the campus to condemn the government's suppression of the student movement. They also posted numerous slogans on the walls of the campus buildings condemning the government's atrocities. The entire Nanterre Faculty of Letters, like in May and June this year, once again brimmed with revolutionary fighting spirit. The just struggle of Nanterre Faculty of Letters students has gained the sympathy and support of a wide range of French students, and the struggle is spreading to other schools and cities. Students and teachers from other faculties of Paris University went on strike and boycotted classes last week to support the struggle of Nanterre Faculty of Letters students. Students in Marseille, France's second-largest city, and Clermont-Ferrand also held demonstrations and fought with the police who came to suppress them.

	The French ruling class, which was heavily struck by the revolutionary movement of the French people in May and June this year, is very afraid of the resurgence of the student and worker movements. On the 16th, French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou hastily delivered a televised address to the nation, threatening that "it cannot be tolerated" for students to occupy schools and engage in political activities within them, and that "all necessary" measures will be taken to suppress the student movement. In recent days, the French government has mobilized a large number of police around universities nationwide to intimidate and monitor students, and has authorized school principals to arbitrarily persecute students who are fighting back, banning these students from attending any university for five years, in an attempt to suppress the student struggle.

	However, French students tempered by the revolutionary storm of May and June this year are not intimidated. The threats and suppression by the French government will only arouse greater anger and stronger resistance from the revolutionary masses. Many university teachers in Paris have angrily pointed out that the recent government order authorizing principals to persecute students has effectively turned the principals into "police chiefs of the universities." These teachers condemn the government's suppression of the student movement and express their support for the students' struggle.

### 巴黎学生再接再厉奋起战斗

    经历革命风暴锻炼的法国青年吓不倒压不服
    巴黎学生再接再厉奋起战斗
    在革命斗争中起带头作用的农泰尔文学院学生，反击警察镇压，英勇坚持斗争，得到法国广大学生支持。学生斗争目前正向其他学校和其他城市发展
    新华社十七日讯巴黎消息：在今年五、六月间席卷法国的人民革命风暴中起了带头作用的巴黎大学农泰尔文学院的学生，最近又掀起了反对腐朽的教育制度，反对政府镇压学生运动的新的斗争浪潮。
    十六日，在巴黎郊区被大批警察包围的农泰尔文学院内，一千五百多名学生举行了大会，并决定坚持罢课，以抗议法国政府无理逮捕和审讯学生。学生们在校园内举行了示威游行，愤怒地高呼：“打倒警察镇压！”“警察滚出去！”大批学生还冲出校门，推倒警察在学院周围设置的障碍物。
    农泰尔文学院学生的这次斗争是在上星期爆发的。十三日，这个学院的几千名学生开始举行罢课，要求政府取消对学生的无理审讯，并释放被捕的同学。将近一个星期以来，他们一直在坚持斗争。他们建立了领导罢课的小组，在校园内多次举行会议和示威游行，谴责政府镇压学生运动。他们还在学院建筑物的墙壁上贴了许多谴责政府暴行的标语。整个农泰尔文学院，象今年五、六月时那样，又一次洋溢着革命的战斗气氛。农泰尔文学院学生的正义斗争获得了法国广大学生的同情和支持，斗争正在向其他学校和城市发展。巴黎大学其他学院的学生和教师上星期举行了罢课和罢教，支援农泰尔文学院学生的斗争。法国的第二大城市马赛和克莱蒙·费朗的学生也举行了示威，同前来镇压的警察进行了搏斗。
    今年五六月受到法国革命群众运动风暴沉重打击的法国统治集团，十分害怕学生和工人运动的再起。十六日，法国总理德姆维尔慌忙向全国发表电视演说，扬言“不能容忍”学生占领学校和在学校里搞政治活动，要采取“一切必要”措施来镇压学生运动。连日来，法国政府在全国各大学的周围调集了大批警察，对学生进行恫吓和监视，并授权各校校长可以任意迫害起来斗争的学生，不许这些学生在五年内上任何大学，妄图把学生的斗争镇压下去。
    可是，经过今年五六月革命风暴锻炼的法国学生是吓不倒的。法国政府的威胁、镇压只会激起革命群众更大的愤怒和更强烈的反抗。巴黎的许多大学教师已经愤怒地指出，法国政府最近授权校长迫害学生的法令，实际上已使校长变成了“大学里的警察局长”。这些教师谴责政府镇压学运的行径，并表示支持学生的斗争。
