In the midst of the deepening struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform, the broad revolutionary staff of Tianjin's financial and commercial front, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have been vigorously carrying out the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they have been vigorously promoting production, ensuring that the market is well-supplied, prices are stable, buying and selling are brisk, and the entire market is prosperous.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, Tianjin's market has been full of good news. Especially this year, the supply of vegetables, meat, poultry, aquatic products, tobacco, alcohol, and other sideline products has been abundant. Except for vegetables, which have maintained a balance with last year, other products have significantly increased compared to last year. Apples, pears, and other fruits have been put on the market in large quantities according to the season, with quantities increasing compared to last year. Cotton cloth, knitted clothing, knitted products, thermos bottles, basins, and other daily necessities are well-stocked. The sales volume of radios, watches, various shoes, towels, soap, and other daily necessities has increased significantly compared to last year. The total retail sales of the whole city have exceeded the historical highest level for two consecutive years. This year, the commercial departments of the whole city have significantly increased the amount of industrial products they have purchased. The second quarter increased by 80% compared to the first quarter, the third quarter increased by 27% compared to the second quarter, and the fourth quarter is expected to increase by 16% compared to the third quarter. This is the result of the broad revolutionary staff of the financial and commercial front's efforts to promote production and revolution, the result of consecutive bumper harvests in agricultural production in our country, the result of the leapfrog development of industrial production, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the broad revolutionary staff of Tianjin's financial and commercial front have been following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, continuously raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promoting the deepening of the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform, and promoting market prosperity. The broad revolutionary staff have turned the counters and shops into battlefields for revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Tianjin who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "business first," "profit-oriented," and "material incentives," resolutely eliminating capitalist business practices, reforming unreasonable regulations, and turning the counters and shops into strongholds for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle to clean up the class ranks, they have firmly implemented the policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and have accurately and resolutely struck down a handful of class enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of who serves whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." The broad revolutionary staff of Tianjin's financial and commercial front have firmly implemented the policy of facing factories, facing rural areas, facing the grassroots, and wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform. To facilitate the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the vast majority of grassroots stores in the city have reasonably adjusted their business hours. Some revolutionary staff members of the stores have gone deep into factories and suburban production brigades to conduct investigations and research, and based on the needs of the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, they have gone from street to street and from door to door at fixed times to deliver goods, which has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary committee members of the Chinese medicine store in Hangu District and some revolutionary staff members have formed a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought and gone deep into factories, rural areas, and streets to conduct investigations and research. They have propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, participated in production labor, and sold medicine to the sick. They have broken through old frameworks, processed Chinese medicine pills for customers, and delivered medicine to the sick. The workers, peasants, and soldiers are satisfied and say: "The Chinese medicine store is open for us, and Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly!"

    天津市场购销两旺一片繁荣
    广大革命职工紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署深入开展斗批改
    新华社天津二十六日电　在深入开展斗、批、改的运动中，天津市财贸战线广大革命职工遵照毛主席
  “发展经济，保障供给”的伟大教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全市商品供应充足，物价稳定，购销两旺，整个市场呈现一片繁荣景象。
    从无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，天津市场到处是一片大好景象。特别是今年以来，蔬菜、肉类、家禽、水产品、烟、酒等副食品货源旺盛，供应充足。除蔬菜和去年保持平衡外，其他都比去年大量增加。苹果、梨等果品按季节大量上市，数量比去年增加。棉布、绒衣、针织品、暖水瓶、脸盆等日用工业品，备货充足。收音机、手表、各种鞋、毛巾、肥皂等日用工业品，销售量比去年大幅度增加。全市社会零售额两年来都超过了历史的最高水平。今年，全市商业部门收购工业产品的数量大幅度增加，第二季度比第一季度增加百分之八十，第三季度比第二季度增加百分之二十七，第四季度预计又比第三季度增加百分之十六。这是财贸战线广大革命职工抓革命、促生产的结果，是我国农业生产连年获得丰收的结果，是工业生产飞跃发展的结果，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，天津市财贸战线广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，推动了斗、批、改的深入开展，促进了市场的繁荣。广大革命职工以柜台、店堂为革命大批判的“战场”，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在天津的代理人推行的“业务第一”、“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，坚决破除资本主义的经营作风，改革不合理的规章制度，把柜台、店堂变成了宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。在清理阶级队伍的斗争中，他们坚决贯彻以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一系列政策，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    毛主席教导我们说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”天津市财贸战线广大革命职工，在斗、批、改中坚决贯彻了面向工厂，面向农村，面向基层，全心全意为工农兵服务的方针。为了便利工农兵，全市绝大多数基层商店都合理调整了营业时间。有些商店的革命职工深入工厂和郊区生产大队进行调查研究，根据工人和贫下中农的需要，在固定时间里走街串巷，送货上门，受到革命群众的热烈赞扬。汉沽区药材商店革命委员会成员和部分革命职工组成毛泽东思想宣传队深入到工厂、农村、街道进行调查研究，边宣传毛主席的最新指示，边参加生产劳动，边问病售药。他们大破旧框框，为顾客加工中药丸，给病人送药上门。工农兵满意地说：“药材商店为咱开，毛泽东思想放光彩！”
