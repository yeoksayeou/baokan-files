Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's two receptions of the representatives of the national coal industry's "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" conference, the million coal miners have achieved one great victory after another. Coal production has steadily increased month by month. Since the fourth quarter, the average daily production of coal mines directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry has exceeded the highest daily production levels of recent years. On the 26th of this month, a new historical record of national coal production was created.

New China News Agency, December 28th: Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's two receptions of the representatives of the national coal industry's "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" conference, the million coal miners of our country, with boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and achieved one brilliant victory after another. At present, the revolutionary and production situation on the national coal industry front is excellent and getting better. Coal production has steadily increased month by month. Since the fourth quarter, the average daily production of coal mines directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry has exceeded the highest daily production levels of recent years. On the 26th of this month, a new historical record of national coal production was created; the tunneling advance has also significantly increased. Among them, the major coal mines in Beijing, Kailuan, Jingxing, Shuangyashan, Fengfeng, Benxi, Beipiao, Datong, Huainan, Jixi, Yangquan, Fuxin, Liaoyuan, Zibo, Zaozhuang, Aganzhen, Jiaozuo, and Hengshan have all completed this year's production tasks ahead of schedule. Many local coal mines have also overfulfilled their production plans.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The achievements of China's coal industry are fundamentally due to Mao Zedong Thought arming the broad revolutionary cadres, unifying their understanding, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially after the great leader Chairman Mao personally approved the convening of the national coal industry's "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" conference and received the conference representatives twice, the broad coal mine workers, with boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and extensively carried out the "Three Loyalty" activities of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This has pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high. According to statistics from the Yangquan Mining Bureau, in the past half year, more than 2,100 classes of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, with 190,000 participants; more than 90% of the workers, family members of workers, and retired workers of Kailuan Coal Mine have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with an average of 20 classes per person. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it turns into a great material force, promoting the continuous development of the revolution and production on the coal industry front.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary cadres on the coal industry front, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have, through repeated class struggles, seized back the part of power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders. Now, out of the 71 major coal mine enterprises nationwide, 68 have established "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees, and the working class has truly taken hold of the leadership of the coal mine enterprises. After the establishment of many coal mine revolutionary committees, they have taken "forever loyalty to Chairman Mao, forever loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line" as the fundamental task of building the revolutionary committees. They have implemented Chairman Mao's every latest instruction and every battle order of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin with the fastest speed and the most resolute actions. They have also earnestly learned from the experience of the People's Liberation Army's political construction of the army, placing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the promotion of the thought revolutionization of people in the first place in all work. The members of the revolutionary committees often go to the teams and work with the workers, maintaining close ties with the masses. The revolutionary committee of Taozhuang Coal Mine in Shandong's Zaozhuang Mining Bureau even insists on inviting revolutionary masses to inspect the work of the revolutionary committee every month, placing the new proletarian revolutionary power under the supervision of the masses and rooting it among the masses.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "the working class must lead everything" was issued, the revolutionary workers in various coal mines acted promptly. In addition to selecting a batch of outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and entering schools and some units that have not done a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, they also organized a large number of part-time investigation teams to conduct serious investigations and research on the history of the two-line struggle in coal mine enterprises and deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. After many coal mine revolutionary workers thoroughly criticized and repudiated the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the coal mine system who promoted the revisionist black goods of "material incentives" and "bonus as the commander," they resolutely reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, implemented political mining, and carried out the activities of "four-good collectives" and "five-good miners." The appearance of the enterprises has been greatly improved. After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad coal mine workers, in combination with the actual situation of their units, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, deeply carried out the study movement of the history of the two-line struggle, and launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thereby further raising the awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle.

The broad coal mine workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the vanguard of the revolution and the pioneers of production. They carry forward the daring to think, daring to do, and daring to pioneer spirit of the proletarian revolution, vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution activities, and promote the development of production. According to incomplete statistics, Kailuan Coal Mine has implemented 148 major innovation projects in the past year. The third mine of Jingxing Mining Bureau, by changing the two-shift coal mining and one-shift roof caving to edge mining and edge caving daily multi-cycle coal mining, and using the new coal mining machine group modified by the workers themselves, has greatly improved work efficiency, and the production has increased by 80% compared to the designed capacity.

At present, the broad revolutionary workers on the coal industry front, with even more ardent fighting spirit, are deeply carrying out the study movement of the history of the two-line struggle, striving to thoroughly implement the various great combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and striving for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve even more excellent results, and dedicate them to the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

    创造优异成绩，向将要召开的党的第九次全国代表大会献礼
    全国煤炭生产成绩辉煌出现新水平
    在伟大领袖毛主席两次接见全国煤炭工业战线抓革命、促生产会议代表的鼓舞下，百万煤矿工人夺得一个又一个的巨大胜利，煤炭产量逐月稳步上升，第四季度以来，煤炭工业部直属煤矿的平均日产量，已经超过最近几年的最高日产水平，本月二十六日创造了全国煤炭产量的历史新纪录
    新华社二十八日讯　在我们伟大领袖毛主席两次接见全国煤炭工业战线抓革命、促生产会议代表的鼓舞下，我国百万煤矿工人怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。目前，全国煤炭工业战线革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。煤炭产量逐月稳步上升。第四季度以来，煤炭工业部直属煤矿的平均日产量，已经超过最近几年的最高日产水平，本月二十六日还创造了全国煤炭产量的历史新纪录；掘进进尺也显著提高。其中北京、开滦、井陉、双鸭山、峰峰、本溪、北票、大同、淮南、鸡西、阳泉、阜新、辽源、淄博、枣庄、阿干镇、焦作、鹤壁等主要煤矿，都提前完成了今年的生产任务。许多地方煤矿也都超额完成了生产计划。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我国煤炭工业取得上述成就，最根本的一条就是毛泽东思想武装了广大革命职工的头脑，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，特别是在伟大领袖毛主席亲自批准召开全国煤炭工业战线抓革命、促生产会议并两次接见会议代表以后，广大煤矿职工怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，广泛开展了忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了一个新的高潮。据阳泉矿务局的统计，近半年来就举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班二千一百多期，有十九万人次参加了学习；开滦煤矿百分之九十以上的职工、职工家属和退休工人都参加了毛泽东思想学习班，平均每人参加学习班二十期。毛泽东思想一旦为广大群众所掌握，就转化为伟大的物质力量，推动了煤炭工业战线革命和生产的不断发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，煤炭工业战线的广大革命职工，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，经过反复的阶级较量，夺回了被一小撮走资派篡夺的那一部分权力。现在全国七十一个主要煤矿企业，已经有六十八个成立了“三结合”的革命委员会，工人阶级真正掌握了煤矿企业的领导大权。许多煤矿革委会成立以后，把永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为革委会革命化建设的根本。他们以最快的速度，最坚决的行动贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的每一个最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，并且认真学习解放军政治建军的经验，把活学活用毛泽东思想，促进人的思想革命化放在一切工作的首位。革委会成员经常到班组和工人一起参加劳动，密切联系群众。山东枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿革委会，还坚持每月请革命群众检查革委会的工作，使新生的无产阶级革命政权置于群众的监督之下，扎根于群众之中。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示发表后，各地煤矿革命职工闻风而动。他们除抽出一批优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，开进学校和一些没有搞好斗、批、改的单位以外，还组织了大量业余调查组，对煤矿企业的两条路线的斗争史进行认真的调查研究，深入进行斗、批、改。许多煤矿的革命职工在狠揭猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在煤矿系统代理人推行的“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货以后，坚决改革了不合理的规章制度，实行政治建矿，开展了“四好集体”“五好矿工”的活动，企业面貌焕然一新。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表以后，广大煤矿职工结合本单位的实际，活学活用毛主席著作，深入开展了两条路线斗争史的学习运动，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，从而进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大煤矿工人，是革命的先锋，生产的闯将。他们发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯的无产阶级革命精神，大搞技术革新、技术革命活动，推动了生产的发展。据不完全统计，开滦煤矿近一年来实现的较大的革新项目就达一百四十八项。井陉矿务局三矿，把两班采煤一班放顶，改为边采边放一日多循环采煤，并且采用了工人自己改装的新采煤机组后，大大提高了工效，产量比设计能力提高了百分之八十。
    目前，煤炭工业战线的广大革命职工，正以更加昂扬的斗志，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，为全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会所提出的各项伟大战斗任务，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，创造更优异的成绩，向党的第九次全国代表大会献礼。
