The elderly brothers Li Jingyang and Li Jingchun from the Spalk Factory Brigade in Shanchengzi Commune, Benxi County, Liaoning, are both in their fifties. The younger brother, Li Jingchun, is an active promoter of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. The elder brother, Li Jingyang, has not been as diligent in studying Chairman Mao's works and often lags behind his younger brother. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, a Mao Zedong Thought study class was established in their home, and the two brothers formed a pair to carry out the "one helps one" and "red pair" activities.

This spring, the production team assigned Li Jingyang to manage the orchard and the ginseng and medicinal herb garden. He hesitated when he received the task. Seeing this, his younger brother had a heart-to-heart talk with him. Li Jingyang told his brother, "Managing the orchard is hard work and doesn't earn many work points. It's better to grow crops." Li Jingchun then realized that the poison of the capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi's "work points as the criterion," was still lingering in his brother's mind. He then studied with his brother Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and "selflessly serving others." They also studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and together criticized the revisionist fallacies of the big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, such as "work points as the criterion" and "material incentives." Li Jingchun said to his brother, "We farm for the revolution, not for work points! If we seek more work points, we will fall into Liu Shaoqi's trap and take the capitalist road." With his brother's help, through self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, Li Jingyang happily accepted the task of managing the orchard. He worked diligently every day, going out early and returning late, crossing rivers and climbing mountains, regardless of the weather. To prevent soil erosion and ensure the healthy growth of the fruit trees, Li Jingyang worked tirelessly for over two months, building stone walls around hundreds of fruit trees, devoting all his energy to his work.

Li Jingyang was busy with his work in the mountains, and over time, he attended the study class less frequently and spoke less during criticism meetings. Li Jingchun felt that his brother's spirit of loving the collective was precious, but if he only focused on production without strengthening the study of Chairman Mao's works and relaxing the revolutionary criticism, he would fall behind. He then reminded his brother, "A good knife will rust if not sharpened, and not studying Chairman Mao's works will lead to backwardness." He studied with his brother Chairman Mao's great teachings on "our important task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism" and "you must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," making Li Jingyang realize that the most important thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts. If one does not master Mao Zedong Thought and lacks awareness of the line struggle, one will become confused. From then on, no matter how busy or tired Li Jingyang was with his work, he actively participated in the study class to learn Chairman Mao's works and join the revolutionary criticism. During the initial evaluation of the Five-Goods this year, both brothers were rated as Five-Goods members, becoming a "red pair."

    老哥俩成了“一对红”
    辽宁本溪县山城子公社碱厂堡大队老贫农李景阳和弟弟李景春，都五十多岁了。弟弟李景春是活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。哥哥李景阳对活学活用毛主席著作抓得不够紧，常常落在弟弟的后面。在解放军帮助下，他家办起了毛泽东思想学习班，老哥俩结成对子，开展了“一帮一”“一对红”活动。
    今年春天，生产队分配李景阳管理队里的果树和人参、药材园子，他在接受任务时有点犹豫。弟弟看到这种情况，就找哥哥谈心。李景阳对弟弟说：“管理果树那活费心费力，不多挣工分，不如种庄稼好。”弟弟李景春这下子明白了，原来党内头号走资派刘少奇“工分挂帅”的流毒还在哥哥脑袋里作怪。于是，他就和哥哥一起学习毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务和“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，学习毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，一起批判了大工贼刘少奇鼓吹的“工分挂帅”“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义谬论。他对哥哥说：“咱们种田是为了革命，可不是为了工分啊！要是为了多得工分，就会上刘少奇的当，走上资本主义的邪道。”李景阳在弟弟的帮助下，通过斗私批修，愉快地接受了看管果树园的任务。他每天早出晚归，过河翻山，风雨不误。为了防止水土流失，保证果树茁壮生长，李景阳奋战了两个多月，把三四百棵果树一棵一棵地围上了石墙，把全部力气都用在工作上了。
    李景阳整天忙山上的活，日子长了，到学习班学习就渐渐少了，开批判会也很少发言。李景春感到哥哥一心热爱集体的精神很可贵，可是如果只埋头搞生产，不加强学习毛主席著作，放松了革命大批判，就要转向。于是，他又提醒哥哥说：“好刀不磨也要生锈，不学习毛主席著作就要落后。”他又和哥哥一起学习了毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”和“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”等伟大教导，使李景阳认识到，千重要万重要，活学活用毛主席著作最重要。如果不掌握毛泽东思想，没有路线斗争觉悟，就要成为糊涂人。从此，李景阳不管生产多么忙，活计多么累，他都积极参加学习班学习毛主席著作，参加革命大批判。今年五好初评时，哥俩都被评上了五好社员，成了“一对红”。
