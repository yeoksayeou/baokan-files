At the Beijing Mining Bureau's conference of active learners and propagators of Mao Zedong Thought, there was a famous "Three Loyalty" coal mining team. This team was formed during the Cultural Revolution and consisted of 61 old miners.

After liberation, Chairman Mao gave coal miners the right to be masters of their own fate. The old miners stood up, saw the light of day, and each one held their heads high. They resolved to follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution, to be good miners for Chairman Mao forever. However, over the past decade, a handful of capitalist roaders within the mine had frantically pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi, attempting to restore capitalism. They feared that these old miners, who loved Chairman Mao so dearly, would obstruct their capitalist restoration. They used every means to gather all the old miners in the mine into the "recovery" workshop, telling them to "rest well," actually isolating the old miners from the mine and imposing various restrictions on them. They did not let the old workers know about the mine's affairs, nor did they allow them to participate in political study and various political movements. Thus, the old miners left the bustling mine pits and the fiery battlefield of class struggle.

On August 12, 1966, the old miners heard Chairman Mao's great voice on the radio: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Chairman Mao's words were like a beacon, illuminating the hearts of the old miners. Suddenly, the "recovery" workshop, which had been quiet for so long, became tumultuous. The old miners rushed out of the "recovery" workshop and returned to the mine and the battlefield of class struggle to seize the revolution and promote production. To express their boundless love for Chairman Mao, they named themselves the "Three Loyalty" coal mining team, vowing to be red miners loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life.

Since the formation of the "Three Loyalty" coal mining team, the old miners have consistently insisted on reading Chairman Mao's books every day, without fail. They repeatedly studied the brilliant work "Qu Yuan Moves Mountains." The spirit of thorough revolution embodied by Old Qu Yuan deeply resonated with each person. These old miners repeatedly requested the revolutionary committee to approve their return to the mine to fight alongside their class brothers. After discussion, the revolutionary committee agreed to their request and assigned them a task of 8,000 tons. However, they found this insufficient and added another 7,000 tons to their task. In the battle, the old workers sincerely declared, "Loyalty to Chairman Mao is shown through actions!"

During the excavation process, due to changes in the geology, the coal that was previously abundant became scarce, making it difficult to complete the task. At this time, some people suggested modifying the plan, fearing they could not complete the task. However, the majority disagreed. They said, "At this critical moment of the great struggle between the two classes and the two lines, this plan cannot be modified. Changing the plan is surrendering to difficulties and disloyalty to Chairman Mao." Facing these difficulties, they launched a revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's capitalist reactionary line, and eliminating the past poison of "material incentives" and "good production is good politics" spread by the capitalist roaders in the mine. This greatly boosted their fighting spirit. They declared: "No matter how the geology changes, our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change! Even if the sky falls, we will hold it up." In their labor, they more consciously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, guiding every action with Mao Zedong Thought. Once, the old worker Li Yanquan, carrying over a hundred pounds of timber, ran back and forth. When comrades suggested he rest, he said, "Soldiers on the battlefield can shed blood and sacrifice for the revolution. I am just a bit tired; what does it matter? The mine urgently needs timber now. To carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I am willing to endure the hardship." He recited, "Firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," while continuing to excellently complete the timber transportation task with everyone. These old miners, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to mine more coal to support socialist construction, had boundless energy. After several months of strenuous efforts, they finally completed the coal mining task ahead of schedule despite the deteriorating geological conditions, greatly promoting their own ideological revolutionization.

The old miners of the "Three Loyalty" coal mining team demonstrated such noble qualities of boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, deeply touching all revolutionary workers and their families in the mine. They enthusiastically praised, "The old miners are spirited and bold, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, their revolutionary youth will never fade, and their loyal hearts shine brightly!"

    人老心红的采煤队
    在北京矿务局活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会上，有一个闻名全矿区的“三忠于”采煤队。这个队是在文化大革命中，由六十一名老矿工组成的。
    解放后，毛主席给了煤矿工人当家做主的权利，老矿工们翻了身，见了太阳，个个扬眉吐气。他们决心跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，做一辈子毛主席的好矿工。可是，十几年来，矿内一小撮走资派疯狂地推行叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，大搞资本主义复辟。他们怕这些无限热爱毛主席的老矿工阻碍他们复辟资本主义，千方百计地把全矿老矿工都集中到“康复”车间，要他们“好好休息”，实际上是把老矿工们和矿区隔离开来，加以种种限制。矿上的事不让老工人知道，政治学习和各种政治运动不让老矿工们参加。就这样，老矿工们离开了沸腾的矿井，离开了火热的阶级斗争的战场。
    一九六六年八月十二日，老矿工们从广播里听到了毛主席的伟大声音：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”毛主席的话象一盏光芒万丈的明灯，照亮了老矿工的心。顿时，“康复”车间打破了以往的平静，沸腾起来了。老矿工们冲出“康复”车间，杀回矿区去，杀回阶级斗争的战场上去，抓革命，促生产。为了表达对毛主席的无限热爱的一片红心，他们取名为“三忠于”采煤队，立志做一辈子忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的红色矿工。
    自从“三忠于”采煤队成立后，老矿工们一直坚持天天读毛主席的书，雷打不动。他们一次又一次地学习《愚公移山》这篇光辉著作。老愚公那种“挖山不止”的彻底革命精神紧紧地扣着每个人的心弦。这些老矿工一次又一次地要求矿革委会批准他们下井和其它阶级兄弟并肩战斗。矿革委会经过研究，同意了老工人的要求，还给了他们八千吨的任务。但是他们嫌少，自己又增加了七千吨的任务。在战斗中，老工人们从内心里发出了一个战斗誓言：“对毛主席忠不忠，看行动！”
    在掘进过程中，由于地质发生了变化，由原来煤多岩少变成了煤少岩多，给完成任务带来了困难。这时有的人怕完不成任务，提出修改计划，但是大多数同志不同意。他们说：“在两个阶级、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，这个计划不能修改。修改计划就是向困难投降，就是对毛主席的不忠。”面对这种困难，他们开展革命大批判，狠批刘少奇资产阶级反动路线，肃清过去矿里走资派推行的“物质刺激”、“生产好就是政治好”的流毒，大大激发了战斗意志。他们表示：地质千变万变，忠于毛主席的红心永远不能变！就是天塌下来，也要顶得住。在劳动中，他们更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，一举一动都用毛泽东思想来统帅。有一次，运木料的老工人李砚全扛着一百多斤的木料来回奔走，同志们要他休息一会，他说：“解放军在战场上为革命可以流血牺牲，我累点算得了什么。现在井内正急需木料，为了执行毛主席的革命路线，再累我也心甘情愿。”他边走边背诵着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”坚持和大家一起出色地完成了运输木料的任务。这些老矿工们，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为了多采煤支援社会主义建设，他们浑身有使不完的劲。经过几个月的努力奋斗，终于在地质变坏的条件下，提前完成了采煤任务，同时也大大促进了自己的思想革命化。
    “三忠于”采煤队的老矿工们这种无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质，深深感动了全矿广大革命职工和家属，他们热情地赞扬说：“老矿工志气刚，毛泽东思想来武装，革命青春永不老，颗颗忠心放光芒！”
