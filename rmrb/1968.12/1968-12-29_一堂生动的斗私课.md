When the sun set and work was over, Zhang Cuirong, the wife of the team leader Wang Shun, brought back seven apples from the fields.

In Xipu Brigade, the orchards cover the hills, and the abundant fruits weigh down the branches. In the past, when team members rested in the fields, they would eat a few apples to quench their thirst, or bring a few home for their children, and it was nothing to worry about. But this time, Wang Shun was different. He thought of Chairman Mao's great teaching, "We must fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and decided to hold a family study session on Mao Zedong Thought regarding these seven apples.

In the family study session on Mao Zedong Thought, Wang Shun and Zhang Cuirong studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together. Zhang Cuirong felt more enlightened the more she studied. She thought: Chairman Mao calls for fighting selfishness, which means we should become people like Norman Bethune, who have no personal gain and work selflessly for the public. But I... Thinking of this, she regretfully said, "I was wrong!"

Seeing that his wife had recognized her mistake, Wang Shun was about to leave for the brigade, taking the apples with him. But as soon as his hand touched the apples, he quickly pulled it back, thinking, "No, fighting selfishness cannot be done on behalf of others; it should be done by letting Cuirong herself return the apples to the brigade, driving out the 'self' completely." So, before leaving, he instructed his wife to handle the seven apples properly.

After Wang Shun left, Zhang Cuirong thought of taking the apples to the brigade quietly under the cover of night when fewer people were around. But she thought again and felt it was not appropriate. She questioned herself: Taking them quietly and changing them secretly is still hiding one's selfishness and fearing to expose it, isn't it? Fighting selfishness and fearing pain? So, she made up her mind to follow Chairman Mao's teaching, "If one makes a mistake, one should correct it, and the quicker and more thoroughly one corrects it, the better." The next day, without waiting for her husband to remind her, Zhang Cuirong handed over the seven apples to the brigade accountant and made a profound self-criticism in front of everyone.

Through this vivid class on fighting selfishness, Wang Shun and his wife Zhang Cuirong deeply realized that if the "self" is not eliminated, it will harm the collective interests. Every member of the commune should be a pioneer in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Their conscious revolutionary actions were praised by the members of Xipu Brigade.

    一堂生动的斗私课
      黄昏收工，大队领导班子成员王顺的爱人张翠荣，从地里带回了七个苹果。
    在西铺大队，果园满坡，累累的果实压弯了枝头。过去，社员在地头歇工，吃几个苹果解解渴，或收工回家带几个给孩子吃，并不当回事。但是，这回王顺可不同了，他想到毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大教导，决定就这七个苹果的事，办一次家庭毛泽东思想学习班。
    在家庭毛泽东思想学习班里，王顺同张翠荣一起学习了《纪念白求恩》。张翠荣越学心里越亮堂。她想：毛主席号召要斗私，就是要我们做一个象白求恩那样没有私心，一心为公的人。可自己……想到这里，她后悔地说：“我错了！”
    王顺见爱人认识了错误，打算去大队时，顺便把苹果捎去。但是，他手刚触到苹果，又马上缩了回来，心里想：“不行，斗私不能包办，应该让翠荣自己退给大队，把‘私’字扫地出门。”于是，他临走时交代爱人要好好处理这七个苹果。
    王顺走后，张翠荣想趁夜间人少把苹果悄悄送到大队去。转念一想，又觉得不妥。她自己质问自己：悄悄送，暗暗改，还不是亮私怕丑，斗私怕痛吗？于是，她下了决心，坚决按照毛主席“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好”的教导去办。第二天，没等爱人催促，张翠荣便把七个苹果交给了大队会计，还当众作了深刻的自我批评。
    王顺和爱人张翠荣，通过这一堂生动的斗私课，深刻认识到，“私”字不倒，就会损害集体利益，每一个公社社员都应该是斗私批修的闯将。他们自觉革命的行动受到了西铺大队社员的称赞。
