Students in Latin America have been continuously staging class boycotts and demonstrations, strongly protesting against dictatorial rule and the persecution by reactionary authorities.

In Nicaragua, which has long been under military dictatorship, hundreds of university students held a demonstration in the capital Managua on the 10th. The students shouted slogans against the government and expressed their support for the just struggles of students in Mexico, Uruguay, and France.

In Colon City, Panama, middle school students recently held a demonstration to protest the military dictatorship's occupation of the University of Panama. The military government sent troops to search the university in the early hours of the 14th and subsequently announced the closure of the school. Previously, Panamanian students had gathered in the University of Panama campus to hold a demonstration against the continued U.S. imperialist occupation of military bases in Panama.

In the important port city of Valparaiso, Chile, 1,500 students from the Normal School of the University of Chile announced an indefinite strike on the 10th to protest the government's reduction of educational funds. The striking students occupied the school buildings and set up barricades. That afternoon, the students bravely fought with armed police for several hours.

In the state capital of Minas Gerais, Brazil, about 700 university students occupied the school buildings in late November to oppose the pro-American dictatorial regime's reactionary policies and demand improvements in education.

La Paz News: On the 18th, farmers in the Beren region of Bolivia drove away the pro-American dictatorial government head, Barrientos, with boos, whistles, and stones.

On that day, the pro-American dictatorial government head, Barrientos, came to Beren, 75 kilometers northeast of La Paz, to deliver a speech, attempting to justify the cruel exploitation and oppression of farmers through the unified agricultural tax. Angry farmers immediately booed and threw stones at him, scaring Barrientos into hastily hiding in a car and leaving Beren in a disgraced manner under the protection of police and guards.

The unified agricultural tax recently enacted by the pro-American military dictatorship in Bolivia is a new measure of exploitation aimed at transferring the current economic crisis to the farmers, making them even more impoverished, and thus seizing their land. This measure has been strongly opposed by the broad masses of farmers since its announcement.

The struggle of Mexican youth students against persecution and massacre, with the support and participation of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other laboring people, has rapidly unfolded. The image shows Mexican women and other masses demonstrating and marching to protest the atrocities of the reactionary authorities and demand the release of arrested youth students.

    新华社讯　一些拉丁美洲国家的青年学生最近不断举行罢课和游行示威，强烈抗议独裁统治和反动当局的迫害。
    在长期处于军事独裁统治下的尼加拉瓜，十日晚有数百名大学生在首都马那瓜举行游行示威。学生们高呼反对政府的口号，并且表示声援墨西哥、乌拉圭和法国大学生的正义斗争。
    巴拿马科隆城的中学生最近举行示威游行，抗议巴拿马军事独裁政府对巴拿马大学实行军事占领。军政府当局在十四日凌晨派出大批军队搜查了这所大学，随后就宣布封闭学校。在此以前，巴拿马的学生曾在巴拿马大学校园里集合，举行了反对美帝国主义继续在巴拿马霸占军事基地的抗议示威。
    在智利重要港口瓦尔帕来索，智利大学师范学院的一千五百名学生，十日宣布举行不定期罢课，抗议政府削减教育经费。罢课学生占领了校舍并筑起了路障。当天下午学生们英勇地同前来镇压的武装警察搏斗了好几个小时。
    巴西米纳斯吉拉斯州首府贝洛奥里藏特一所大学的约七百名大学生，在十一月下旬占领了学校校舍，反对亲美独裁政权的反动政策，要求改善教育状况。
    新华社二十日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚贝伦地区的农民十八日用嘘声、口哨声和石块轰走了亲美独裁政府头子巴里恩托斯。
    这一天，亲美独裁政府头子巴里恩托斯来到离拉巴斯东北七十五公里的贝伦发表演说，妄图为他残酷剥削和压榨农民的农牧业统一税辩解。愤怒的农民立即向他发出嘘声并投掷石块，吓得巴里恩托斯慌忙躲进汽车，在警察和卫队的保护下，灰溜溜地离开了贝伦。
    玻利维亚亲美军事独裁政权最近制订的一项农牧业统一税，这是巴里恩托斯政府为了把目前的经济危机转嫁到农民身上，使广大农民更加贫困，从而夺走他们的土地的一种新的剥削措施。这种措施一宣布，就遭到广大农民的强烈反对。（附图片）
    墨西哥青年学生反迫害、反屠杀的斗争，在广大工人、农民和其他劳动群众支持和参加下，迅猛地展开。图为墨西哥妇女和其他群众示威游行，抗议反动当局的暴行，要求释放被捕的青年学生。
