Capitalist financial crisis new storm hits British Empire
British government in panic, pound in precarious situation

LONDON, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) — The latest wave of the capitalist financial crisis has pushed the pound, which was devalued just a year ago, into a precarious situation. To save the pound, the British Labour government is further tightening the belts of the broad masses. However, the Labour government's misguided policies cannot cure Britain's financial and economic ills but will instead accelerate the deepening of the political and economic crisis of this old imperialist power.

The outbreak of the capitalist financial crisis is an important sign of the accelerating collapse of the capitalist system. In just one year, this crisis has breached the pound's defenses, causing it to devalue, and has severely impacted the dollar, the pillar of the capitalist financial and monetary system, causing it to face frequent crises. Recently, the new storm of the crisis almost engulfed the French franc. Although this time the storm centered on the franc, the pound, which remains weak after devaluation, has also been heavily hit and is in a precarious situation. In various financial centers of the capitalist world, the pound's exchange rate has plummeted to its lowest level since devaluation, and in some places, it has even fallen below the officially stipulated minimum price. From November 15 to 19, the Bank of England sold over 1 billion pounds in foreign currency to buy pounds, but it still could not stabilize the situation. In the chaos, the British authorities, along with some Western European countries, closed the foreign exchange market starting from the 20th until the 25th. It is worth noting that in the year since its devaluation, the pound has repeatedly faced crises. In December last year and March this year, when the capitalist world saw a wave of selling dollars and buying gold, the pound also faced similarly dire situations. In this year, every time there was any political or economic turmoil at home or abroad, the pound would suffer.

The above situation shows that the pound is still in deep crisis after devaluation. This crisis is the inevitable result of the rapid decline of British imperialism. As the British colonial system disintegrates under the impact of the revolutionary waves in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the financial and economic foundation of British imperialism, which mainly relies on the exploitation and plunder of the colonial peoples, along with the pound, which reflects the financial and economic strength of British imperialism, has fallen into an inevitable crisis. The British Labour government had attempted to ease the crisis by borrowing heavily from abroad and squeezing the people, but the result was a complete failure, and the pound had to be devalued. After that, the Labour government, in addition to continuing to borrow heavily from abroad and more brutally exploiting the people, also tried to use the opportunity of the pound's devaluation to lower the price of British goods in foreign markets and vigorously expand exports to reverse the situation of Britain's international trade deficit, which has been in the red for years, thereby stabilizing the pound's position. However, the facts show that this plan has failed.

After the pound's devaluation, Britain's financial and economic situation, especially the international trade situation that directly affects the pound's position, continues to deteriorate. In the first seven months of this year, the trade deficit averaged over 70 million pounds per month. Although it decreased in August and September, it rose again to 66 million pounds in October. Due to the increase in the trade deficit, Britain's international trade deficit in the first half of this year reached 500 million pounds, approaching last year's total. At the same time, foreign debt continues to increase. Britain already had a foreign debt of 2-3 billion pounds at the time of the pound's devaluation. In September of this year, it made arrangements to borrow an additional $2 billion in "standby credit" from abroad to deal with the withdrawal of pound reserves by pound area countries to exchange for other currencies, which in effect means the further disintegration of the pound area.

Given Britain's financial weakness, the current new storm of the capitalist financial crisis has caused British rulers to panic, fearing that the situation may force the recently devalued pound to devalue again, thereby dealing a disastrous blow to the pound and British imperialism's international position. In this situation, the Labour government decided to more frantically shift the difficulties to the people and announced a series of measures, including tax increases, on the 22nd. These measures will allow the Labour government to extort 1.15 billion pounds from the people through tax increases alone this year, causing prices, which have already risen significantly since the pound's devaluation, to soar again, and further expanding the already large army of unemployed.

However, the Labour government's policy of extortion cannot save British imperialism's ailing financial and economic situation and the pound's position. On the contrary, it will further exacerbate the Labour government's crisis. As soon as the government's measures were announced, a buying spree ensued, wiping out various goods sold at pre-tax prices. This reflects both the bleak prospects of the British economy and the unpopularity of the government's policies.

Amidst the angry protests of the broad masses of workers, the ruling class is in chaos. The leadership of the British Trade Union Congress, controlled by the Labour Party, publicly criticized the Labour government's measures, and 22 Labour MPs did not dare to vote in favor of the tax increase. The opposition Conservative Party took the opportunity to attack the Labour government for leading Britain "from one disaster to another." Western media figures said that the Labour Party is facing its most serious crisis since it came to power five years ago.

    资本主义金融危机新风暴猛袭英帝
    英国政府惊慌失措英镑处境岌岌可危
    新华社伦敦三十日电 本社记者报道：资本主义世界最近刮起的金融危机的新风暴，使得贬值刚刚一年的英镑又一次陷入摇摇欲坠的危急局面。为挽救英镑，英国工党政府正在进一步迫使广大人民把裤带勒得更紧。但是，工党政府的倒行逆施医治不了英国的财政经济痼疾，反而将加速这个老牌帝国主义政治经济危机深化的进程。
    资本主义世界金融危机的爆发，是资本主义制度加速走向全面崩溃的重要标志之一。在短短一年中，这场危机的浪潮冲垮了英镑的堤防，使英镑贬了值，并且猛烈冲击了作为资本主义金融货币体系的台柱的美元，使它频频告急。最近，危机的新风暴又险些吞没了法国的法郎。虽然这一次风暴中心直奔法郎而来，但是贬值后仍然十分虚弱的英镑，也受到沉重打击，处境岌岌可危。在资本主义世界各金融中心，英镑牌价急剧下跌到贬值以来的最低水平，有些地方甚至低于官方所规定的最低价格。从十一月十五日至十九日这四天中，英格兰银行抛出了值一亿镑以上的外国货币来收购英镑，却仍然不能稳住阵脚。在一片混乱中，英国当局同一些西欧大陆国家的当局一起，从二十日开始关闭了外汇市场，直到二十五日才重新开放。值得注意的是：贬值一年来，英镑不断出现危局。去年十二月和今年三月资本主义世界刮起抛售美元、抢购黄金的风暴时，英镑都出现过同这次类似的险恶局面。在这一年中，每逢英国国内外政治、经济领域中有什么风吹草动，英镑都得遭殃。
    上述情况表明，英镑在贬值后仍然危机深重。这种危机是英帝国主义迅速衰落的必然结果。随着英帝国殖民体系在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民革命浪潮的冲击下加速瓦解，主要靠剥削和掠夺殖民地人民起家的英帝国主义的财政经济，连同反映英帝国主义财政经济实力的英镑，也就陷入了不可摆脱的危机之中。英国工党政府曾经企图靠大借外债和压榨人民的办法来缓和危机，结果却一败涂地，英镑终于不得不贬值。其后工党政府除继续大借外债和更加残酷地向人民开刀外，还企图利用英镑贬值后英国商品在国外市场上价格降低的机会，大力扩大出口，以扭转近年来英国国际收支连年出现巨额逆差的局面，从而稳定英镑地位。但是，事实表明，这种打算已经落空。
    英镑贬值后，英国财政经济状况，特别是直接影响英镑地位的国际收支状况，在继续恶化。今年头七个月，对外贸易逆差每月平均在七千万镑以上，八月和九月虽然有所下降，十月却又上升到六千六百万镑。由于对外贸易逆差增加，英国今年上半年国际收支逆差就达到五亿镑，接近去年全年的数额。同时，外债也继续增加。英国在英镑贬值时已经背负着二、三十亿英镑外债。今年九月，它又同外国作好挪借二十亿美元“备用信贷”的安排，以应付英镑区国家抽走英镑结存去兑换其他货币，这实际上就意味着英镑区的进一步解体。
    英国财力既如此空虚，因此，目前这场资本主义世界金融危机新风暴的来袭，就使得英国的统治者惊惶失措，十分担心事态的发展有可能迫使刚贬值不久的英镑再次贬值，从而使英镑和英帝国主义的国际地位一起受到灾难性的打击。在这种情况下，工党政府决定更加疯狂地向人民转嫁困难，在二十二日宣布了增税等一系列措施。这些措施将使工党政府在今年一年中仅通过增税就搜刮到十一亿五千万镑，使英镑贬值以来已经大大上涨了的物价再次飞涨，并且将使庞大的失业大军继续扩大。
    但是，工党政府这种横征暴敛的措施并不能挽救英帝国主义病入膏肓的财政经济和英镑地位，相反，将进一步加剧工党政府的危机。政府的措施一宣布，马上出现了抢购风，把以增税前的价格出售的各种商品一扫而光。这既反映了英国经济的暗淡前景，也反映了政府政策的不得人心。
    在广大工人群众的愤怒抗议声中，统治集团陷入一片混乱。由工党控制的英国职工大会的领导机构公开指责工党政府的措施，二十二个工党议员也不敢投票赞成增税。在野的保守党更是乘机攻击工党政府把英国“从灾难引向灾难”。西方报界人士说，工党面临的可能是上台五年来最严重的危机。
