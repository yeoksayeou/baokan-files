	Albanian "People's Voice" Exposes Indian Reactionaries' Betrayal of National Interests by Aligning with U.S. Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism

	Indian Laborers Increasingly Awakened and Strengthening Revolutionary Struggle

	New China News Agency, Tirana, December 19th -- The Albanian "People's Voice" published an article on the 18th, exposing the crimes of Indian reactionaries in aligning with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, betraying national interests; and praising the brave struggle of Indian laborers against reactionary rule.

	The article said, class contradictions in India are becoming increasingly sharp. Millions of impoverished peasants and workers in many places in India have been fighting against the cruel exploitation of feudalism and the bourgeoisie, and against the anti-people policies of the Indira Gandhi government.

	The article said, the Indian ruling clique, internally, represents and maintains the interests of the big bourgeoisie and landlords; externally, it opens the door wide to the economic infiltration of foreign monopolies, primarily the monopolies of the United States and the economic infiltration of Soviet modern revisionism.

	The article exposed that the "aid" provided by the Soviet revisionist leadership to India has already reached 135 million U.S. dollars. The Soviet revisionists particularly want to seize control of the leadership and management of India's heavy industry.

	The article said, while accepting political, economic, and military "aid" from U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, the Indian reactionaries have turned themselves into active tools serving U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The Indian reactionaries have turned India into a base for aggression against the People's Republic of China and against the liberation movements of the peoples of various Asian countries.

	The article pointed out that due to the Indian reactionary government's implementation of anti-national and anti-people policies, millions of urban and rural laborers in India are suffering greater hardships. Facing the ruthless exploitation of domestic landlords, the bourgeoisie, and foreign capital, millions of impoverished peasants and workers in India have recently intensified their struggle.

	The article pointed out that the revolutionary peasants of Naxalbari in India have abandoned the capitulationist line of revisionism and ignited the flames of armed struggle. At the same time, the student movement is also flourishing.

	The article concluded by saying that the struggle of Indian workers, peasants, and students against the Indian reactionaries reflects the sharpening of class contradictions in India and the heightened awareness of millions of urban and rural laborers. The broad masses of Indian laborers are increasingly believing that only through resolute and uncompromising struggle can they win their rights.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》揭露印度反动派投靠美帝苏修出卖民族利益
    印度劳动人民日益觉醒正在加强革命斗争
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十八日发表文章，揭露印度反动派投靠美帝、苏修，出卖民族利益的罪行；赞扬印度劳动人民反对反动统治的英勇斗争。
    文章说，印度的阶级矛盾正在日益激化。千百万穷苦农民和工人在印度许多地方进行了反对封建主义、资产阶级的残酷剥削和反对英迪拉·甘地政府反人民政策的斗争。
    文章说，印度统治集团对内代表和维护大资产阶级和大地主的利益；对外为外国垄断资本，首先是为美国的垄断资本和苏联现代修正主义的经济侵入敞开大门。
    文章揭露说，苏修领导集团对印度的“援助”早已达到十三亿五千万美元。苏联修正主义者特别想把印度重工业的领导和控制权抓到手中。
    文章说，印度反动派在接受美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的政治、经济、军事的“援助”的同时，使自己变成了为美帝和苏修效劳的积极工具。印度反动派已把印度变成了反对中华人民共和国和反对亚洲各国人民解放运动的侵略基地。
    文章指出，由于印度反动政府推行反民族和反人民的政策，印度千百万城乡劳动人民正在遭受更大的苦难。面对着本国地主、资产阶级和外国资本的残酷无情的剥削，印度千百万穷苦农民和工人最近加强了他们的斗争。
    文章指出，印度纳萨尔巴里的革命农民抛弃了修正主义的投降主义路线，燃起了武装斗争的火焰。与此同时，学生运动也正在蓬勃开展。
    文章最后说，印度工人、农民和学生进行的反对印度反动派的斗争，反映了印度阶级矛盾的激化和千百万城乡劳动人民觉悟的提高。广大印度劳动人民越来越相信，只有通过坚决的、毫不妥协的斗争，才能赢得自己的权利。
