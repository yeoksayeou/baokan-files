The U.S. imperialists, in a desperate attempt to save themselves from extinction, are hastening to collude with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to launch a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary peoples of the world. But this counter-revolutionary struggle will only hasten their doom.

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, our era is one in which imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is marching towards global victory. Under the impact of the world revolutionary torrent that is sweeping across the four seas and shaking the five continents, the days are getting tougher for the U.S. imperialists, the most ferocious enemy of the peoples of the world. The political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism are rapidly developing, and it is deeply mired in internal and external difficulties, facing a dead-end situation. This fully exposes its paper tiger nature of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and its declining state.

The world revolutionary tide is surging and surging.

The U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression has suffered heavy blows.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The U.S. imperialists are bullying and oppressing everywhere, putting themselves in a position of enmity with all the peoples of the world, making themselves more and more isolated.... The tide of the peoples of the world against the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will certainly achieve even greater victories."

The development of the world revolutionary situation over the past year has once again proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's profound judgment. In the contemporary people's revolutionary struggle storm center of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the national liberation movements and people's armed struggles are raging, continuing to develop deeply, and have dealt increasingly heavy blows to the U.S. and its lackeys, accelerating the bankruptcy of the U.S.-Soviet collusion policy to divide the world and establish hegemony.

In the Asian region, the U.S. policy of aggression and war is suffering increasingly heavy defeats. The Vietnamese people, in their great war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation, have persisted in people's war, engaging in repeated struggles with the U.S., annihilating a large number of U.S. puppet and mercenary forces, and have beaten the U.S. aggressors into a state of disarray and disarray. The U.S. defeat in South Vietnam has greatly deepened the serious political and economic crises within the United States. The patriotic military and people of Laos have bravely fought over the past year, fiercely striking at the U.S. and its Laotian puppet army, consolidating and expanding the liberated areas, and achieving new victories in the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Burma, the armed forces of Burma have raised the revolutionary banner of "winning the war and seizing power," and over the past year have engaged in fierce battles with the military of the Ne Win reactionary clique supported by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, achieving major victories. In Thailand, an important base for the U.S. war in Vietnam, the people's armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand is blazing more and more fiercely and developing rapidly. The Thai people's armed forces have launched a series of offensive operations over the past year, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thanom clique. The people's armed struggles in Malaya, Indonesia, and other countries are also developing continuously; the people's revolutionary struggles in India, Japan, and other countries are surging forward.

At the same time, the armed struggle of the Palestinian people is advancing victoriously; the struggle of the Arab peoples against the U.S.-Israeli aggressors is in full swing. The struggle of the peoples of African countries against the new and old colonialists is continuing and deepening. In Latin America, which the U.S. regards as its "backyard," a mass struggle against U.S. imperialism, dictatorship, oppression, and exploitation is surging. The workers' movement and the students' movement have surged to new heights this year, and the struggle is more clearly directed against the U.S.

What makes the U.S. imperialists particularly uneasy is that in the heartland of imperialism, Western Europe and North America, the people's revolutionary struggles have risen and fallen over the past year, like a mighty torrent, powerfully shaking the reactionary rule of imperialism led by the United States. The U.S. imperialists have already been deeply surrounded by the peoples of various countries. The peoples of the world are accelerating the burial of this evil U.S. imperialism.

The imperialist bloc is split and crumbling.

The U.S. hegemony is shaken to its core.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialist system is riddled with contradictions that cannot be resolved, plunging the imperialists into great anguish."

This year, the prominent manifestation of the development of contradictions within the imperialist bloc is that, around the issue of the U.S. and the Soviet Union hastening to collude to redivide the world, the imperialist bloc has engaged in fierce arguments; with the outbreak of the biggest financial crisis in the capitalist world in forty years, the capitalist countries have been engaged in a tense struggle to shift the crisis onto each other.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China points out: "The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are attempting to redivide the world, colluding with each other while also competing with each other. The U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam has received the tacit approval and support of the Soviet revisionists, while the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's open invasion of Czechoslovakia has also received the tacit approval and support of the U.S. imperialists." The political dealings between the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have deepened the contradictions within the imperialist bloc and the modern revisionist bloc. After the U.S. secretly allowed the Soviet revisionists to invade Czechoslovakia behind the backs of its Western European "allies," France, which has long been at odds with the United States, once again launched an offensive against the United States. French President Charles de Gaulle openly expressed his opposition to the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to "divide Europe into two," forming two blocs dominated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union respectively. He accused the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists of tacitly acknowledging each other's "supreme hegemony" within their respective spheres of influence, while emphasizing the need to build a "Europe of Europeans." West Germany and Britain also expressed their dissatisfaction with the U.S. maneuvering to divide the world with the Soviet revisionists behind their backs, fearing that it would harm their own interests. In an attempt to ease the contradictions with its Western European "allies," the U.S. specially convened the winter meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization one month in advance this year, trying to seek "common understanding" with the "allies." However, contrary to the U.S.'s subjective wishes, this meeting not only failed to ease the contradictions among the imperialists but instead made the already fragmented North Atlantic Treaty Organization even more disintegrated.

The outbreak of the biggest financial crisis in the capitalist world in forty years this spring and the continued development of this crisis have dealt a heavy blow to the entire capitalist world financial and monetary system. This is an important sign of the acceleration of the deepening of the general political and economic crisis of capitalism and the acceleration of the decline of imperialism. It has made the sharp and complex contradictions among the imperialists even more acute. Each imperialist country, in order to save itself, wants to make its neighbors suffer, transferring the disaster to others, and thus staging a series of mutual accusations. Whether it is the frequent marathon meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors or the protracted bilateral haggling talks between countries, they cannot solve their problems or ease their contradictions. This makes the days of the imperialist bloc leader, U.S. imperialism, particularly difficult.

The revolutionary mass movement at home is surging.

The reactionary rule of monopoly capital is increasingly unstable.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of the American blacks is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited blacks but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie."

The defeat of the U.S. imperialists' policy of external aggression and expansion has promoted the development of various contradictions and crises within the United States, plunging the U.S. imperialists into a situation of internal and external attacks, making it difficult to defend itself. The unprecedented intensification of class contradictions in the United States in 1968 is a sign of this development, with the main manifestations being: the revolutionary struggle of the people is on the rise, and the American people are in a new state of awakening.

Since this year, the struggle of American blacks, based on the continuous rise over the years, has developed further. In particular, the new storm of the American black struggle triggered by the assassination of black pastor Martin Luther King by the U.S. imperialists in April, which lasted for more than ten days, quickly swept across more than a hundred cities across the country, fully demonstrating the immense revolutionary power hidden among the more than 20 million blacks in the United States. The broad masses of American blacks have further reviewed their strength in this year's struggle, tempered their fighting will, and raised their political consciousness. They are playing a great role in the struggle of the American people.

The struggle of the broad masses of American blacks is an important part of the struggle of the American working class against the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. Since this year, the tide of the American workers' struggle against exploitation and oppression and for their own rights has risen higher and higher, continuing to push forward the high tide of the American workers' strike struggle that has emerged in recent years, especially since last year. Workers in the struggle have displayed the spirit of unity, perseverance, and fearlessness, defying the laws and prohibitions of the bourgeoisie, breaking through the shackles set by the yellow union leaders, and bravely launching attacks on the monopoly bourgeoisie. At the same time, the student movement in the United States is rising, and the movement of the American people against the war in Vietnam is also continuing to deepen. These struggles have converged into a mighty torrent, powerfully shaking the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie.

In the face of the all-around rising tide of the struggle of the American people, the American reactionary ruling clique is hastening to plot the use of naked fascist methods to maintain its reactionary rule at home. But this can only be like lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet, making the struggle of the American people develop even more rapidly.

The political and economic crises are developing comprehensively.

The ruling clique is in chaos.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The economic strength of U.S. imperialism, which was enhanced during World War II, is facing an unstable and shrinking domestic and international market. The further shrinkage of this market will lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis."

For many years, U.S. imperialism has been madly expanding its military and preparing for war, further intensifying its policy of aggression and war. The U.S.'s perverse actions have completely gone against its subjective wishes.

Since the war, the U.S. has spent trillions of dollars on military expansion and the implementation of its policy of aggression and expansion. To raise these funds, it has resorted to printing money, levying various oppressive taxes, and borrowing huge amounts of public debt, etc. The result is that it has caused domestic currency to depreciate, prices to skyrocket, and the fiscal deficit to grow larger; at the same time, a large amount of dollars have flowed out, and the international balance of payments has shown a huge deficit. This has fundamentally weakened the U.S.'s financial and monetary hegemony in the capitalist world.

Currently, the situation of U.S. imperialism is quite miserable. It wants to strengthen its aggression, but its finances cannot support it; while it wants to save its financial crisis, its military power will inevitably be weakened. U.S. imperialism is in a dilemma in this dead end. At the same time, the industrial production situation in the United States is also far from good, and the situation of the financial crisis and the crisis of overproduction intertwining and occurring simultaneously is becoming more and more apparent.

The various contradictions and crises at home and abroad have made the internal dog-eat-dog struggle of the American reactionary ruling clique increasingly fierce, with politicians representing different monopoly capitalist groups attacking and undermining each other, with no end in sight. Johnson's forced announcement of his withdrawal from the presidential election, the assassination of Robert Kennedy during the election campaign, and Nixon's narrow victory as the Republican candidate, all these indicate that the American ruling clique is already in chaos. Western media generally believe that Nixon's rise to power will not only be powerless to reverse the internal and external contradictions and crises of U.S. imperialism but will also make these contradictions more acute.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The various irreconcilable contradictions at home and abroad are like a volcano, threatening U.S. imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano." Currently, U.S. imperialism, in an attempt to save itself from extinction, is hastening to collude with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to launch a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary peoples of the world. But this counter-revolutionary struggle will only hasten their collapse. A new historical period of opposition to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun, and the day when all reactionaries are thoroughly buried is not far off.

Facing the predicament of internal and external difficulties and a dead-end situation, the U.S. leader Johnson is trembling with fear, with a gloomy face and helpless.

    各国人民反美怒潮势不可挡　国内政治经济危机急剧发展
    美帝纸老虎内外交困日子越来越不好过
    美帝国主义为了挽救它的灭亡，正在加紧勾结苏修叛徒集团向世界革命人民进行疯狂反扑，但这种反革命的挣扎只能加速它末日的到来
    据新华社二十七日讯　本社记者报道：我们的时代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。在四海翻腾，五洲震荡的世界革命洪流的冲击下，全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过。美帝国主义的政治经济危机正在急剧发展，它已深深陷入内外交困，走投无路的绝境，充分地暴露了它的外强中干、日趋没落的纸老虎本质。世界人民革命怒潮汹涌澎湃
  美帝侵略政策遭到沉重打击
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。……全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”
    一年来世界革命形势的发展再一次证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。在当代人民革命斗争风暴的中心地区亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，民族解放运动和人民武装斗争如火如荼，正在继续深入发展，给了美帝及其走狗以越来越沉重的打击，使美苏勾结妄图瓜分世界、建立世界霸权的政策加速破产。
    在亚洲地区，美帝的侵略和战争政策正在遭到日益惨重的失败。越南人民在伟大的抗美救国战争中，坚持人民战争，同美帝进行了反复的较量，消灭了美伪军和仆从军大量有生力量，把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。美帝在南越战场上的惨败，大大加深了美国国内政治经济的严重危机。老挝爱国军民一年来勇敢战斗，猛烈地打击美帝及其老挝走狗军队，巩固和扩大了解放区，取得了抗美救国斗争的新胜利。
    缅甸人民武装在缅甸共产党领导下，高举“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命大旗，一年来同美帝、苏修支持下的奈温反动集团的军队进行了激烈的战斗，取得了重大的胜利。在美帝侵越战争的重要基地泰国，泰国共产党领导的人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺，迅猛发展。泰国人民武装一年来的主动出击，十分沉重地打击了美国—他侬集团。马来亚、印度尼西亚等国的人民武装斗争也在不断发展；印度、日本等国的人民革命斗争浪潮滚滚向前。
    与此同时，巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争在胜利前进；阿拉伯国家人民反对美—以侵略者的斗争方兴未艾。非洲国家人民反对新、老殖民者的斗争，在继续坚持和深入发展。在被美帝视为其“后院”的拉丁美洲，一个反美帝、反独裁、反压迫、反剥削的群众斗争正在蓬勃发展，工人运动、学生运动，今年出现新的高涨，而且斗争的矛头更加明确地直接指向美帝。
    使美帝国主义十分不安的是，在帝国主义的心脏地区，西欧、北美人民革命斗争一年来彼伏此起，其势如排山倒海，有力地冲击着以美国为首的帝国主义的反动统治。美帝国主义已经深深陷入各国人民的重重包围中。世界人民正在加速埋葬这个无恶不作的美帝。
      帝国主义集团四分五裂
        美帝霸主地位空前动摇
    毛主席教导说：“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”
    今年来，帝国主义集团内部矛盾发展的突出表现是：围绕着美苏加紧勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界的问题，帝国主义集团发生了激烈的争吵；随着资本主义世界四十年来最大的金融危机的爆发，资本主义各国互相转嫁危机，展开紧张的厮杀。
    中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报指出：“美帝和苏修妄图重新瓜分世界，互相勾结，又互相争夺。美帝国主义对越南进行的侵略战争，得到了苏修的默契和支持，而苏修叛徒集团公开出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，也得到了美帝的默契和支持。”美帝、苏修这种政治交易加深了帝国主义集团和现代修正主义集团的内部矛盾。在美帝背着它的西欧“盟国”默许苏修侵捷后，一向同美国抗衡的法国，再次向美国发起攻势。法国总统戴高乐公开表示反对美苏合谋“把欧洲分割为二”，分成由美苏主宰的“两个集团”。他指责美帝苏修彼此默认各自在自己的势力范围内有“至高无上的霸权”，而强调要建立“欧洲人的欧洲”。西德、英国也对美帝撇开它们同苏修瓜分世界的行径表示不满，担心会损害它们自己的利益。美帝为了缓和同西欧“盟国”的矛盾，在今年特意提前一个月召开北大西洋集团理事会冬季会议，企图同“盟国”谋求“共同的谅解”。可是，同美帝的主观愿望相反，这个会议不但没有能够缓和这些帝国主义之间的矛盾，反而使早已四分五裂的北大西洋集团更加分崩离析。
    今春资本主义世界四十年来最大的金融危机的爆发以及这一危机的持续发展，给了整个资本主义世界金融货币体系以十分沉重的打击。这是资本主义政治经济总危机加速深化，帝国主义加速没落的一个重要标志。它使帝国主义集团之间尖锐复杂的矛盾更趋激化。各帝国主义国家为了保全自己，都想以邻为壑，把灾难转嫁给别人，为此而演出一幕幕互相攻讦的丑剧。无论是各国财长和中央银行行长频频举行的马拉松会议也好，还是各国之间旷日持久地举行的双边扯皮谈判也好，都不能解决它们的问题，缓和它们的矛盾。这使得帝国主义集团的头子美帝国主义的日子特别不好过。
    国内革命群众运动风起云涌
      垄断资本反动统治日益不稳
    毛主席教导说：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”
    美帝国主义对外侵略扩张政策的惨败，促进了美国国内各种矛盾和危机的发展，使美帝国主义陷于内外夹攻，难以招架的境地。一九六八年美国国内阶级矛盾的空前激化就是这种形势发展的一个标志，其主要表现是：人民革命斗争出现全面高涨趋势，美国人民处在新的觉醒中。
    今年以来，美国黑人斗争在连年不断高涨的基础上，又有了新的发展。特别是四月间以黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被美帝国主义者杀害为导火线而触发的美国黑人斗争新风暴，在持续十多天的时间内，迅速席卷全国一百多个城市，充分显示出美国两千多万黑人中，蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量。美国广大黑人群众在今年的斗争中，进一步检阅了自己的力量，锻炼了自己的战斗意志，提高了自己的政治觉悟。他们在美国人民的斗争中正在起着伟大的作用。
    美国广大黑人群众的斗争，是美国工人阶级反对垄断资产阶级反动统治的斗争的重要组成部分。今年以来，美国工人反对剥削压迫、争取自身权利的斗争浪潮一浪高一浪，把最近几年来，特别是去年以来出现的美国工人罢工斗争的高潮，继续向前推进。工人们在斗争中发扬了团结战斗、坚韧不拔的精神，蔑视资产阶级的法律和禁令，冲破黄色工会头目所设置的羁绊，英勇地向垄断资产阶级发动进攻。与此同时，美国学生运动正在兴起，美国人民反对侵越战争的运动也在继续深入发展。这几种斗争，汇成了一股巨大的洪流，猛烈地冲击着垄断资产阶级的反动统治。
    在美国人民斗争全面高涨的形势面前，美国反动统治集团正加紧策划用赤裸裸的法西斯手段来维持其在国内的反动统治。但是，这只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，使美国人民的斗争更加迅猛地发展。
      政治经济危机全面发展
        统治集团内部乱作一团
    毛主席教导说：“美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战期间所增强起来的经济力量，遇着了不稳定的日趋缩小的国内市场和国际市场。这种市场的进一步缩小，就要引起经济危机的爆发。”
    多年来，美帝国主义一直在疯狂扩军备战，变本加厉地推行侵略和战争政策。美帝的这种倒行逆施，已经完全走向它主观愿望的反面。
    战后以来，美帝用于扩军备战和推行侵略扩张政策的费用，以万亿美元计。为了筹措这些费用，它所采用的办法是滥发通货，征收各种苛捐杂税，举借巨额公债等等。结果，在国内造成通货恶性膨胀，物价扶摇上升，财政赤字越来越大；同时，美元大量外流，国际收支出现巨额逆差。这就从根本上削弱了美国在资本主义世界的财政金融霸权地位。
    目前，美帝国主义的处境十分狼狈，它要加强侵略力量，财政金融支撑不了；而要挽救财政金融危机，军事力量必然受到削弱。美帝国主义在这条死胡同中进退两难。与此同时，美国的工业生产情况也很不美妙，财政金融危机和生产过剩危机交织并发的情况越来越明显。
    国内外重重的矛盾和危机使美国反动统治集团内部狗咬狗的斗争越演越烈，代表着各个不同垄断资本集团利益的政客互相攻讦，互相倾轧，不可开交。约翰逊的被迫宣布退出总统竞选，罗伯特·肯尼迪在竞选活动中被暗杀，共和党尼克松以微弱多数上台，所有这些，都说明美国统治集团内部已经乱作一团。西方报刊普遍认为，尼克松上台，不但对美帝国主义内外的矛盾和危机回天无术，而且将会使这些矛盾更趋恶化。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”目前，美帝国主义为了挽救它灭亡的命运，正在加紧勾结苏修叛徒集团向世界革命人民进行疯狂反扑。但是，这种反革命的挣扎，只能加速它们的崩溃。一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始，一切反动派被彻底埋葬的日子不远了。
