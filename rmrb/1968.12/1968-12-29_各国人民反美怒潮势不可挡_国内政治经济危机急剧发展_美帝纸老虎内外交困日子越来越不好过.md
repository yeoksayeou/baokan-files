The U.S. imperialists, in a desperate attempt to save themselves from extinction, are hastening to collude with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to launch a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary peoples of the world. But this counter-revolutionary struggle will only hasten their doom.

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, our era is one in which imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is marching towards global victory. Under the impact of the world revolutionary torrent that is sweeping across the four seas and shaking the five continents, the days are getting tougher for the U.S. imperialists, the most ferocious enemy of the peoples of the world. The political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism are rapidly developing, and it is deeply mired in internal and external difficulties, facing a dead-end situation. This fully exposes its paper tiger nature of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and its declining state.

The world revolutionary tide is surging and surging.

The U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression has suffered heavy blows.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The U.S. imperialists are bullying and oppressing everywhere, putting themselves in a position of enmity with all the peoples of the world, making themselves more and more isolated.... The tide of the peoples of the world against the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will certainly achieve even greater victories."

The development of the world revolutionary situation over the past year has once again proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's profound judgment. In the contemporary people's revolutionary struggle storm center of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the national liberation movements and people's armed struggles are raging, continuing to develop deeply, and have dealt increasingly heavy blows to the U.S. and its lackeys, accelerating the bankruptcy of the U.S.-Soviet collusion policy to divide the world and establish hegemony.

In the Asian region, the U.S. policy of aggression and war is suffering increasingly heavy defeats. The Vietnamese people, in their great war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation, have persisted in people's war, engaging in repeated struggles with the U.S., annihilating a large number of U.S. puppet and mercenary forces, and have beaten the U.S. aggressors into a state of disarray and disarray. The U.S. defeat in South Vietnam has greatly deepened the serious political and economic crises within the United States. The patriotic military and people of Laos have bravely fought over the past year, fiercely striking at the U.S. and its Laotian puppet army, consolidating and expanding the liberated areas, and achieving new victories in the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Burma, the armed forces of Burma have raised the revolutionary banner of "winning the war and seizing power," and over the past year have engaged in fierce battles with the military of the Ne Win reactionary clique supported by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, achieving major victories. In Thailand, an important base for the U.S. war in Vietnam, the people's armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand is blazing more and more fiercely and developing rapidly. The Thai people's armed forces have launched a series of offensive operations over the past year, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thanom clique. The people's armed struggles in Malaya, Indonesia, and other countries are also developing continuously; the people's revolutionary struggles in India, Japan, and other countries are surging forward.

At the same time, the armed struggle of the Palestinian people is advancing victoriously; the struggle of the Arab peoples against the U.S.-Israeli aggressors is in full swing. The struggle of the peoples of African countries against the new and old colonialists is continuing and deepening. In Latin America, which the U.S. regards as its "backyard," a mass struggle against U.S. imperialism, dictatorship, oppression, and exploitation is surging. The workers' movement and the students' movement have surged to new heights this year, and the struggle is more clearly directed against the U.S.

What makes the U.S. imperialists particularly uneasy is that in the heartland of imperialism, Western Europe and North America, the people's revolutionary struggles have risen and fallen over the past year, like a mighty torrent, powerfully shaking the reactionary rule of imperialism led by the United States. The U.S. imperialists have already been deeply surrounded by the peoples of various countries. The peoples of the world are accelerating the burial of this evil U.S. imperialism.

The imperialist bloc is split and crumbling.

The U.S. hegemony is shaken to its core.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialist system is riddled with contradictions that cannot be resolved, plunging the imperialists into great anguish."

This year, the prominent manifestation of the development of contradictions within the imperialist bloc is that, around the issue of the U.S. and the Soviet Union hastening to collude to redivide the world, the imperialist bloc has engaged in fierce arguments; with the outbreak of the biggest financial crisis in the capitalist world in forty years, the capitalist countries have been engaged in a tense struggle to shift the crisis onto each other.

The communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China points out: "The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are attempting to redivide the world, colluding with each other while also competing with each other. The U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam has received the tacit approval and support of the Soviet revisionists, while the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's open invasion of Czechoslovakia has also received the tacit approval and support of the U.S. imperialists." The political dealings between the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have deepened the contradictions within the imperialist bloc and the modern revisionist bloc. After the U.S. secretly allowed the Soviet revisionists to invade Czechoslovakia behind the backs of its Western European "allies," France, which has long been at odds with the United States, once again launched an offensive against the United States. French President Charles de Gaulle openly expressed his opposition to the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to "divide Europe into two," forming two blocs dominated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union respectively. He accused the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists of tacitly acknowledging each other's "supreme hegemony" within their respective spheres of influence, while emphasizing the need to build a "Europe of Europeans." West Germany and Britain also expressed their dissatisfaction with the U.S. maneuvering to divide the world with the Soviet revisionists behind their backs, fearing that it would harm their own interests. In an attempt to ease the contradictions with its Western European "allies," the U.S. specially convened the winter meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization one month in advance this year, trying to seek "common understanding" with the "allies." However, contrary to the U.S.'s subjective wishes, this meeting not only failed to ease the contradictions among the imperialists but instead made the already fragmented North Atlantic Treaty Organization even more disintegrated.

The outbreak of the biggest financial crisis in the capitalist world in forty years this spring and the continued development of this crisis have dealt a heavy blow to the entire capitalist world financial and monetary system. This is an important sign of the acceleration of the deepening of the general political and economic crisis of capitalism and the acceleration of the decline of imperialism. It has made the sharp and complex contradictions among the imperialists even more acute. Each imperialist country, in order to save itself, wants to make its neighbors suffer, transferring the disaster to others, and thus staging a series of mutual accusations. Whether it is the frequent marathon meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors or the protracted bilateral haggling talks between countries, they cannot solve their problems or ease their contradictions. This makes the days of the imperialist bloc leader, U.S. imperialism, particularly difficult.

The revolutionary mass movement at home is surging.

The reactionary rule of monopoly capital is increasingly unstable.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of the American blacks is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited blacks but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie."

The defeat of the U.S. imperialists' policy of external aggression and expansion has promoted the development of various contradictions and crises within the United States, plunging the U.S. imperialists into a situation of internal and external attacks, making it difficult to defend itself. The unprecedented intensification of class contradictions in the United States in 1968 is a sign of this development, with the main manifestations being: the revolutionary struggle of the people is on the rise, and the American people are in a new state of awakening.

Since this year, the struggle of American blacks, based on the continuous rise over the years, has developed further. In particular, the new storm of the American black struggle triggered by the assassination of black pastor Martin Luther King by the U.S. imperialists in April, which lasted for more than ten days, quickly swept across more than a hundred cities across the country, fully demonstrating the immense revolutionary power hidden among the more than 20 million blacks in the United States. The broad masses of American blacks have further reviewed their strength in this year's struggle, tempered their fighting will, and raised their political consciousness. They are playing a great role in the struggle of the American people.

The struggle of the broad masses of American blacks is an important part of the struggle of the American working class against the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. Since this year, the tide of the American workers' struggle against exploitation and oppression and for their own rights has risen higher and higher, continuing to push forward the high tide of the American workers' strike struggle that has emerged in recent years, especially since last year. Workers in the struggle have displayed the spirit of unity, perseverance, and fearlessness, defying the laws and prohibitions of the bourgeoisie, breaking through the shackles set by the yellow union leaders, and bravely launching attacks on the monopoly bourgeoisie. At the same time, the student movement in the United States is rising, and the movement of the American people against the war in Vietnam is also continuing to deepen. These struggles have converged into a mighty torrent, powerfully shaking the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie.

In the face of the all-around rising tide of the struggle of the American people, the American reactionary ruling clique is hastening to plot the use of naked fascist methods to maintain its reactionary rule at home. But this can only be like lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet, making the struggle of the American people develop even more rapidly.

The political and economic crises are developing comprehensively.

The ruling clique is in chaos.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The economic strength of U.S. imperialism, which was enhanced during World War II, is facing an unstable and shrinking domestic and international market. The further shrinkage of this market will lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis."

For many years, U.S. imperialism has been madly expanding its military and preparing for war, further intensifying its policy of aggression and war. The U.S.'s perverse actions have completely gone against its subjective wishes.

Since the war, the U.S. has spent trillions of dollars on military expansion and the implementation of its policy of aggression and expansion. To raise these funds, it has resorted to printing money, levying various oppressive taxes, and borrowing huge amounts of public debt, etc. The result is that it has caused domestic currency to depreciate, prices to skyrocket, and the fiscal deficit to grow larger; at the same time, a large amount of dollars have flowed out, and the international balance of payments has shown a huge deficit. This has fundamentally weakened the U.S.'s financial and monetary hegemony in the capitalist world.

Currently, the situation of U.S. imperialism is quite miserable. It wants to strengthen its aggression, but its finances cannot support it; while it wants to save its financial crisis, its military power will inevitably be weakened. U.S. imperialism is in a dilemma in this dead end. At the same time, the industrial production situation in the United States is also far from good, and the situation of the financial crisis and the crisis of overproduction intertwining and occurring simultaneously is becoming more and more apparent.

The various contradictions and crises at home and abroad have made the internal dog-eat-dog struggle of the American reactionary ruling clique increasingly fierce, with politicians representing different monopoly capitalist groups attacking and undermining each other, with no end in sight. Johnson's forced announcement of his withdrawal from the presidential election, the assassination of Robert Kennedy during the election campaign, and Nixon's narrow victory as the Republican candidate, all these indicate that the American ruling clique is already in chaos. Western media generally believe that Nixon's rise to power will not only be powerless to reverse the internal and external contradictions and crises of U.S. imperialism but will also make these contradictions more acute.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The various irreconcilable contradictions at home and abroad are like a volcano, threatening U.S. imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano." Currently, U.S. imperialism, in an attempt to save itself from extinction, is hastening to collude with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to launch a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary peoples of the world. But this counter-revolutionary struggle will only hasten their collapse. A new historical period of opposition to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun, and the day when all reactionaries are thoroughly buried is not far off.

Facing the predicament of internal and external difficulties and a dead-end situation, the U.S. leader Johnson is trembling with fear, with a gloomy face and helpless.
