	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 13th, exposing the U.S. imperialists' aggression and control over Thailand, and calling on the Thai people to persist in armed struggle to overthrow the U.S.-Thanom reactionary regime.

	The article states that the so-called "economic and technical aid agreement" signed between the U.S. and the Thai reactionary clique is entirely to cover up the nature of the traitors and aggressors. The Associated Press admits that 85% of the "economic and technical aid" given by the U.S. to the Thanom traitor clique is used to suppress the patriotic people of Thailand. The essence of U.S. "economic aid" is to help the Thanom clique suppress the people to support the reactionary rule of its running dogs, and at the same time to permanently occupy Thailand, turning it into a new-type colony.

	The article states that U.S. imperialism has already controlled Thailand's affairs from the central government to the local areas, even to the remote regions, by sending so-called "advisors" and "experts." It has controlled the tools of oppression from the Ministry of Defense to the platoons, from the police headquarters to the local police. The puppet Prime Minister Thanom revealed that in 1967 alone, the U.S. sent 512 so-called "experts" to Thailand. The Thanom-Prapas clique formulates policies according to the intentions of U.S. "advisors" and "experts," placing Thailand completely under U.S. rule.

	The article strongly condemns the U.S. for using "economic aid" as a pretext to arm the Thai reactionaries, brutally suppressing the thriving patriotic armed struggle of the Thai people. The article states that according to a Reuters report, the U.S. provided over $3.5 million in "economic aid" to Thailand last year, with over $2.2 million of that amount used to expand the police force. The U.S. directs the Thanom traitor clique to organize "village defense corps," providing money and weapons, to massacre the Thai people. The Thanom traitor clique also sends local officials from governors to village heads to the U.S. or has U.S. "advisors" conduct anti-communist training for them. The U.S. has fundamentally controlled Thailand's local administration. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency also controls all secret intelligence in Thailand.

	The article points out that Thailand is under the iron hoof of the U.S., its independence and sovereignty have been almost completely lost, and it has become a new-type colony of the U.S.

    扶植傀儡集团　控制各级行政　掌握军警大权
    美帝公然把泰国变为新型殖民地
    据新华社十五日讯  “泰国人民之声”电台十三日广播一篇文章，揭露美帝国主义对泰国的侵略和控制，号召泰国人民坚持武装斗争，推翻美国—他侬集团的反动统治。
    文章说，美国同泰国反动集团签订的所谓“经济技术援助协定”，完全是为了掩盖卖国者和侵略者的本质。美联社承认，美国给予他侬卖国集团的“经济技术援助”，百分之八十五是用于镇压泰国爱国人民的。美国“经济援助”的实质，就是帮助他侬集团镇压人民以支撑其走狗的反动统治，同时也为了永远占领泰国，把泰国变为它的新型殖民地。
    文章说，美帝国主义已通过向泰国派遣所谓“顾问”和“专家”控制了泰国从中央到地方以至边远地区的事务，控制了从国防部到连队、从警察厅到地方警察等这些镇压人民的工具。傀儡总理他侬透露，仅一九六七年，美帝派到泰国的所谓“专家”就有五百一十二人。他侬—巴博集团按照美国“顾问”和“专家”的意图制订政策，使泰国完全置于美帝统治之下。
    文章强烈谴责美帝借“经济援助”之名武装泰国反动派，疯狂镇压蓬勃发展的泰国人民爱国武装斗争。文章说，据路透社报道，美帝去年向泰国提供的三千五百多万美元“经济援助”总额中，用于扩充警察的费用即达二千二百多万美元。美帝指使他侬卖国集团组织“乡村保安队”，由美国出钱出武器，屠杀泰国人民。他侬卖国集团还把从府尹、县长到村长的各级地方官员，派到美国或由美国“顾问”对他们进行反共训练。美国已从根本上控制了泰国的地方行政。美国中央情报局也控制了泰国所有的机密情报。
    文章指出，泰国处于美帝的铁蹄之下，泰国的独立主权已丧失殆尽，成了美帝的新型殖民地。
