	Japan's Sato reactionary government, in response to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to establish an anti-China encircling ring, is hurriedly expanding its military forces and actively preparing for external military aggression.

	In recent years, the Sato reactionary government has been actively creating public opinion to accelerate the revival of militarism and external military aggression. Sato Eisaku openly declared: "I think the provision in the Constitution that uses self-defense forces to defend the country is not enough." This statement exposed the Japanese reactionary ruling clique's eagerness to amend the Japanese Constitution to seek opportunities in the future to send troops to invade other countries. The former "Director-General" of Japan's "Defense Agency," Masuda Koji, blatantly shouted that Japan should strengthen the defense of "various free countries in Asia" by expanding its military forces.

	To coordinate with U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, and to carry out external military aggression, the Japanese reactionaries are hurriedly expanding their military forces according to their third military expansion plan. According to Japanese bourgeois newspapers, Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" have formulated an aggressive "strategic plan" according to the "division of labor" between Japan and the U.S. According to this "strategic plan," the Japanese reactionaries are vigorously expanding their air force, attempting to establish their own air "strike force." The decision by Japan's "Defense Agency" to equip the Japanese air force with the longest-range, nuclear weapon and missile-carrying American Phantom jets to attack targets far from Japan is an important step in establishing what they call their air "strike force." It is reported that officials of Japan's "Defense Agency" have arrogantly stated that Japan should, like the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, vigorously carry out "ocean expansion" and establish a "sea control force" that can "balance" with other countries, so as to obtain "strong influence" in "international affairs." The heads of Japanese monopolistic capital and military leaders have been continuously advocating that Japan should use its own navy to "protect" the "sea transport" from the Japanese archipelago through the Malacca Strait to the Middle East, that is, to regard the vast sea from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean as the range of activities for the Japanese navy's aggression. The Japanese reactionaries are, according to the needs of the above-mentioned plan of aggression, building various types of warships in large quantities and preparing to build large cruisers and aircraft carriers, etc.

	The Japanese reactionaries, in order to realize their aggressive ambitions, have taken the secret path of nuclear armament.

	The aggressive plots of the Japanese reactionaries are directly aimed at the various countries of Asia, first and foremost at China. The "Mitsuyu Plan," which was exposed a few years ago, was aimed at China as the main "hypothetical enemy." Japanese bourgeois newspapers admit that the "strategic plan" of Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" and various military exercises are all aimed at countries like China.

### 适应美帝苏修建立反华包围圈的需要  日本反动派加紧扩军备战

    适应美帝苏修建立反华包围圈的需要
    日本反动派加紧扩军备战
    本报讯　日本佐藤反动政府适应美帝、苏修建立反华包围圈的需要，加紧扩充军事力量，积极准备对外进行军事侵略。
    近年来，佐藤反动政府一直在为加速复活军国主义、对外进行军事侵略，大肆制造舆论。佐藤荣作公然扬言：“我认为宪法中用自卫力来保卫国家的规定是不够的”。这句话暴露了日本反动统治集团急于修改日本宪法，以便将来寻机出兵侵略其他国家的阴谋。日本“防卫厅”前任“长官”增田甲子七明目张胆地叫嚷日本要为加强亚洲“各自由国家的防御”而扩充军备。
    为了配合美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，对外进行军事侵略，日本反动派正在根据它的第三次扩军计划加紧进行扩军备战。据日本资产阶级报刊透露，日本的“自卫队”已经按照“日美分工”，制定了一个侵略性的“战略计划”。根据这个“战略计划”，日本反动派正在大力扩充空军，企图建立它自己的空中“出击力量”。日本“防卫厅”决定用续航距离最长、能够携带核武器和导弹攻击日本以外的遥远目标的美国鬼怪式喷气战斗机来装备日本空军，就是建立它所谓的空中“出击力量”的一个重要步骤。据报道，日本“防卫厅”的负责官员还狂妄地表示：日本要象美帝、苏修那样，大力进行“海洋扩张”，建立起将能同别国“取得平衡”的“制海力”，以便取得对“国际事件”的“强有力的发言权”。日本垄断资本头目和军事头目也不断地鼓吹，日本要用自己的海军来“保护”从日本列岛经马六甲海峡到中东地区的“海上运输”，也就是说，要把从太平洋到印度洋的辽阔海面都看作是日本海军侵略活动的范围。日本反动派正在根据上述侵略计划的需要，大量建造各类军舰，并准备建造大型巡洋舰和航空母舰等等。
    日本反动派为了实现它的侵略野心，已走上秘密地进行核武装的道路。
    日本反动派的侵略阴谋，矛头直接指向亚洲各国，首先是指向中国。几年前被揭发过的“三矢计划”，就是以中国为主要“假想敌”的。日本资产阶级报纸承认，日本“自卫队”的“战略计划”和多次军事演习，都是以中国等国家为“对象”的。
