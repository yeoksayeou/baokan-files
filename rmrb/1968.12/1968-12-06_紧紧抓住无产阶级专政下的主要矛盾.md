The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee that the fundamental domestic contradiction throughout the entire socialist period is the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. This contradiction runs through the entire transitional period and serves as the fundamental starting point for our observation of things, determination of policies, conduct of work, and handling of problems. We must be adept at grasping this main contradiction amidst the myriad changes and complex situations. Only in this way can we, in the "long march" of class struggle, always grasp the direction of the struggle and never lose our way.

In August this year, we collaborated with the workers' propaganda team to enter a notorious "persistent problem" middle school. Using the perspective of class struggle, we conducted investigations and analyses and discovered that the reason why this school was a "persistent problem" was that a handful of capitalist roaders and ghosts and snakes were using bourgeois factionalism to cause trouble and launch attacks on the proletariat. We grasped this main contradiction and mobilized the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school to launch a fierce criticism of Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." On the basis of raising the class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, we exposed a gang of remnants of the Kuomintang. We then advanced victoriously, and the revolutionary situation developed rapidly, quickly establishing a revolutionary committee with three-in-one combination.

Soon after, we began the work of allocating graduates. At that time, we thought that since the revolutionary committee had been established and the great criticism had been conducted thoroughly, a handful of class enemies could not cause trouble. Therefore, we concentrated our efforts on the specific work of allocation, neglecting the struggle between the two classes and two kinds of ideologies, and temporarily set aside the handful of class enemies. As a result, after a flurry of activity, the allocation work was not done well, and some capitalist roaders and ghosts and snakes took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and bourgeois ideology began to spread again. This alerted us that no matter how the situation changes, we must firmly grasp the main contradiction and not let it go. We must not think that once the revolutionary committee is established, the counter-revolutionary forces will be tamed. We must not lose the direction of the struggle.

In response to this problem, we conducted a serious analysis and found that the allocation work was not done well mainly because the poison of the "theory of reading books to become officials" had not been eliminated. Therefore, we mobilized the entire school's teachers and students to criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary fallacy. Because we grasped this main contradiction, a new high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation quickly arose, and the allocation work became much easier.

This made us realize that the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is always the main contradiction under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Killing Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, these big rats spreading the plague, does not mean the elimination of the plague germs. Liu Shaoqi is not an isolated individual but the representative of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and his poison is still active in people's minds. If we do not recognize this, we will suffer defeats in the class struggle. To consolidate and develop the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must firmly grasp the main contradiction and not let it go. We must continuously raise our awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle, and continuously raise the level of struggle. Only in this way can we firmly grasp the initiative in class struggle and carry out the "long march" of class struggle to the end.

    紧紧抓住无产阶级专政下的主要矛盾
    班长　费厚清
    伟大领袖毛主席早在七届二中全会报告中就指出：整个社会主义时期的国内基本矛盾，是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾。这个矛盾贯串于整个过渡时期，成为我们观察事物、决定政策、进行工作、处理问题的根本出发点。我们要善于在千变万化的复杂情况中，抓住这个主要矛盾不放，这样，才能在阶级斗争的“万里长征”中，始终把握斗争的大方向，永远不迷航。
    今年八月，我们配合工人宣传队进驻一个有名的“老大难”中学。我们用阶级斗争的观点，进行了调查和分析，发现“老大难”所以难，就是因为有一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神利用资产阶级派性在捣乱，在向无产阶级进攻。我们抓住这个主要矛盾，发动全校革命师生，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。在广大革命师生提高阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟的基础上，揪出了一伙国民党的残渣余孽。乘胜前进，革命形势飞速发展，很快就成立了三结合的革命委员会。
    不久，我们开始进行毕业生分配工作。当时我们认为，革委会成立了，大批判搞得很深了，一小撮阶级敌人翻不了天，因此，就集中力量搞分配的具体工作，忽视了两个阶级、两种思想的斗争，把一小撮阶级敌人暂时搁到了旁边。结果忙了一阵子，分配工作没有干好，一些走资派和牛鬼蛇神却乘机兴风作浪，资产阶级思想又泛滥开来。这使我们警觉到，不管情况怎样千变万化，主要矛盾都要紧紧抓住不放。决不能认为：成立了革委会，反革命势力就会老实了。千万不能迷失了斗争的大方向。
    针对这个问题，我们认真地进行了分析，发觉分配工作没做好，主要是“读书做官”论的流毒没有肃清。于是，我们发动全校师生，对刘少奇的这个反革命谬论进行了批判。由于抓住了这个主要矛盾，很快地掀起了斗批改的新高潮，分配工作也就好做多了。
    这使我们体会到：无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，始终是无产阶级专政条件下的主要矛盾。打死了刘少奇和他的同伙这些传播鼠疫的大老鼠，决不等于消灭了鼠疫菌。刘少奇不是孤立的一个人，而是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的总代表，他的流毒还在人们的头脑里活动着。如果不认识到这一点，我们就会在阶级斗争中打败仗。我们要巩固和发展无产阶级专政，就要狠狠抓住主要矛盾不放，就要不断提高我们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，不断提高斗争水平。只有这样，才能牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权，把阶级斗争的“万里长征”进行到底。
