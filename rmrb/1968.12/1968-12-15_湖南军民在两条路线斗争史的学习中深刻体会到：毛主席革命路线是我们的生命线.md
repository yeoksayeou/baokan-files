Hunan military and civilians, in their study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, have deeply realized: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our lifeline.

Broad masses of revolutionary people link the struggle in their own regions with the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fiercely denounce and criticize the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: The 38 million heroic sons and daughters of Hunan, the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, have extensively and deeply carried out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines. They enthusiastically praise the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fiercely denounce and criticize the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi. This has greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and powerfully promoted the rapid development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The re-publication of the brilliant document, "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," by our great leader Chairman Mao, and the latest directive of Chairman Mao, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be frequently and repeatedly spoken about. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," have greatly inspired and educated the heroic people of Hunan. In studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians have closely linked it with the actual struggle in their own regions and deeply realized: In Hunan, it has always been an important battlefield for the fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. Over the past decade or so since liberation, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Hunan Province has been extremely sharp and complex. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Hunan have held high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and followed our great leader Chairman Mao closely, thoroughly smashing the evil plots of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, and are now striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad revolutionary people, filled with passion, say, every step forward we take is guided by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; every victory we achieve is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline; implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is victory and happiness.

In carrying out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad revolutionary masses enthusiastically praise the unparalleled correctness and great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the place where the red sun rises, Shaoshan, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians repeatedly study and visit Chairman Mao's former residence to express their loyalty. They say, the more we study, the closer we feel to Chairman Mao. The more we study, the more we hate Liu Shaoqi. The more we study, the clearer the direction becomes, and we are full of energy. We are determined to forever implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and swear to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death. In Wengyang County, where the great leader Chairman Mao led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops to a victorious meeting, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have, in recent days, carefully studied the history of the struggle between the two lines and held a long-distance welcoming parade through seven brigades. They say, at the critical moment when Chiang Kai-shek raised the butcher's knife against the revolutionary people and Chen Duxiu, Liu Shaoqi, and their ilk knelt before the enemy to jointly strangle the revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the Autumn Harvest Uprising, created the first armed force of the people, and established the Red Base of Jinggangshan, opening up the only correct path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed force for the Chinese revolution. We must forever follow the great commander Chairman Mao and advance bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! In Changsha, the glorious city where our great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities began, the brick and wood workers who, forty-six years ago, under Chairman Mao's personal initiation and leadership, held a great strike and achieved a great victory, have launched a study high tide. The brick and wood workers who are gloriously fighting on the reconstruction site of Chairman Mao's alma mater, Hunan First Normal School, say in their study, decades of revolutionary struggle practice have proven that with the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, there is the present of the working class. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Historical experience is worth noting." We must sing the praises of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and must talk about class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, not only year after year, month after month, day after day, but also generation after generation, so that our socialist state will never change color.

With Chairman Mao's latest directives and brilliant documents as weapons, the broad revolutionary masses fiercely denounce and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. In Zhuzhou City, the workers of Hongxiangjiang Machinery Factory have carefully reviewed the history of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines since the factory was established and have carried out a thorough criticism. In 1957, Liu Shaoqi came to this factory and peddled the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "self-built public assistance" and "workers' backwardness" for workers' dormitories, committing heinous crimes. Many teams in the 307 workshop held on-site criticism meetings beside the "self-built public assistance" houses, and old workers angrily said: Liu Shaoqi, this big traitor to the workers, talks about "self-built public assistance" and tries to turn workers into property owners. This is evidence of Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Tianhua Brigade, Guangfu Commune, Changsha County, who have suffered persecution from the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, angrily exposed and criticized Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of supporting the ghosts and snakes to rebel and framing and persecuting revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out capitalist restoration when he came here in 1961. They are determined to make full use of Liu Shaoqi as a negative example to carry out a deeper revolutionary criticism, clearly draw the line between the two lines, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death.

    湖南军民在两条路线斗争史的学习中深刻体会到：
    毛主席革命路线是我们的生命线
    广大革命群众联系本地区的斗争实际，大赞大颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，狠揭狠批刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行
    据新华社长沙电　我们伟大领袖毛主席的家乡湖南省的三千八百万英雄儿女，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，在广泛深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，大赞大颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，狠揭狠批党内头号走资派刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了斗、批、改的迅猛发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这一光辉文献的重新发表和毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示的发表，极大地鼓舞和教育了英雄的湖南人民。广大军民在学习两条路线斗争史中，紧密联系本地区的斗争实际，深深认识到：在湖南，历来是革命和反革命激烈搏斗的重要战场。解放十几年来，湖南省两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，一直十分尖锐复杂。在无产阶级文化大革命中，湖南人民高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，彻底粉碎了刘少奇及其同伙的罪恶阴谋，正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。广大革命人民满怀激情地说，我们每前进一步，都是毛主席无产阶级革命路线在指引；我们的每一个胜利，都是执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线所取得的。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是我们的生命线，执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是胜利，就是幸福。
    广大革命群众在开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，大赞大颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无比英明正确和伟大胜利。在红太阳升起的地方韶山，广大军民一遍又一遍地学习，一次又一次地到毛主席旧居献忠心。他们说，我们越学习，对毛主席越亲。越学习，对刘少奇越恨。越学习，越觉得方向明，浑身都是劲。我们决心永远执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在伟大领袖毛主席领导秋收起义部队胜利会师的浏阳县文家市的广大贫下中农和革命群众，连日来，认真地学习了两条路线斗争的历史，并且举行了途经七个大队的长途欢呼游行。他们说，在蒋介石向革命人民举起屠刀，陈独秀、刘少奇之流跪倒在敌人脚下，合伙扼杀革命的危急关头，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导秋收起义，缔造第一支人民武装，建立井冈山红色根据地，为中国革命开辟了农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的唯一正确道路。我们要永远紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！在我们伟大领袖毛主席从事革命活动最早的光荣城市长沙市，四十六年前在毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导下举行大罢工获得伟大胜利的泥木工人，掀起了学习高潮。光荣地战斗在毛主席的母校——湖南第一师范复建工地的泥木工人，在学习中说，几十年的革命斗争实践证明，有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才有我们工人阶级的今天。毛主席教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。”我们就是要大歌大颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们就是要大讲特讲阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，不但要年年讲，月月讲，天天讲，而且要世世代代讲，使我们的社会主义江山永不变色。
    广大革命群众以毛主席的最新指示和光辉文献为武器，狠揭狠批大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。在株洲市，红湘江机器厂的工人们认真回顾了建厂以来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，深入开展革命的大批判。一九五七年，刘少奇窜到这个厂，大肆贩卖职工宿舍“自建公助”、“工人落后”等反革命修正主义黑货，犯下了滔天罪行。三零七车间的许多班组在“自建公助”的房子旁召开现场批判会，老工人愤怒地说：刘少奇这个大工贼，搞什么“自建公助”，妄图把工人演变为房产主。这是刘少奇复辟资本主义的罪证。曾经遭受反革命修正主义路线迫害的长沙县广福公社天华大队广大贫下中农和革命干部愤怒地揭发和批判了刘少奇一九六一年窜到这里，支持牛鬼蛇神翻天，打击陷害革命干部和贫下中农，大搞资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。他们决心充分利用刘少奇这个反面教员，更深入地开展革命大批判，把两条路线斗争的界限划得清清楚楚，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
