Recently, the Italian people have launched a new wave of struggle against the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. Workers, agricultural workers, and students across the country have gone on strike, boycotted classes, marched in demonstrations, and bravely fought against reactionary police. The storm of the revolutionary mass movement, sweeping across the entire Apennine Peninsula, has shown the unprecedented awakening and strength of the Italian people, who have a glorious tradition of anti-fascist struggle.

Since the beginning of this year, the revolutionary mass movement in Italy has surged forward in waves. The workers' movement, student movement, and peasant movement have risen and fallen in succession, resonating with each other, and fiercely assaulting the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The continuous rise of the Italian revolutionary mass movement is the inevitable result of the intensification of class contradictions within Italy and a reflection of the deepening political and economic crisis in the entire capitalist world. Due to the malignant development of the economic and financial crisis in the capitalist world, Italy's economic situation is becoming increasingly dire. The monopolistic bourgeoisie in Italy, in order to shift economic difficulties, relentlessly intensify the exploitation of the working people. They adopt measures such as capital concentration, enterprise mergers, and so-called "production mechanization" and "rationalization," leading to massive unemployment. The reactionary economic policies of the Italian ruling class, which target the working people, naturally face strong resistance from the broad masses. The politically awakened Italian people increasingly realize that to change their situation, they must overthrow the decaying capitalist system. Today's Italy is like a powder keg, and a single spark can ignite a blaze of struggle.

The direct trigger for this new storm of struggle by the Italian people is the reactionary authorities' brazen order to police to shoot striking workers. The reactionaries always think that they can intimidate the people and extinguish resistance with bayonets and bullets. But the opposite is true. The more the reactionaries carry out bloody suppression, the more the revolutionary forces develop. As the great Lenin said: "If the masses have already been roused, if tens of millions of people have already begun to move, then no persecution and no suppression can stop the movement. Persecution can only arouse struggle and draw more and more new fighters into the struggle." The fierce development of the storm of the Italian revolutionary mass movement once again proves this truth of Marxism-Leninism.

The new wave of struggle currently launched by the Italian people is a continuation of the great revolutionary storm that erupted in Europe and North America this spring and is a part of the revolutionary mass movement in the entire capitalist world. The imperialists led by the United States were terrified by the "May Storm" and are using every means to try to quell the tide of people's struggle and stabilize the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The modern revisionists, centered around the Soviet revisionist clique, are also working hard to maintain the "laws and order" of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and to obstruct the broad masses from rising up in revolt. However, the revolutionary mass movements in capitalist countries are like the surging waves of the sea, constantly breaking through the dikes set up by imperialism and its running dogs, surging forward. The United Press International recently anxiously cried out: "The turbulent autumn in Europe is developing into a chaotic winter." This clearly reflects the extreme fear of the imperialists led by the United States towards the continuous rise of the revolutionary mass movement in Europe.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own doom. The awakening of the masses of the people in the colonies and semi-colonies and the masses of the people in the imperialist countries themselves is such a condition. Imperialism drives the masses of the people of the whole world to the great struggle to eliminate imperialism." Today, the national democratic revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the revolutionary mass movements in Europe, North America, and Oceania, have merged into a mighty revolutionary torrent, fiercely assaulting the entire old world. The revolutionary people of the world unite, persist in the struggle, and we will surely bury all imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries in the grave!

    意大利革命群众运动的新风暴
    本报评论员
    最近，意大利人民又掀起了反对垄断资产阶级反动统治的斗争新高潮。各地的工人、农业工人和学生罢工罢课，游行示威，同反动警察英勇搏斗。声势浩大的革命群众运动的风暴，席卷整个阿平宁半岛。具有反法西斯斗争光荣传统的意大利人民，以新的革命斗争行动，显示了他们的空前觉醒和强大力量。
    今年以来，意大利的革命群众运动一浪高一浪地蓬勃发展。工人运动、学生运动、农民运动此伏彼起，互相呼应，猛烈地冲击着垄断资产阶级的反动统治。意大利革命群众运动的不断高涨，是意大利国内阶级矛盾激化的必然结果，是整个资本主义世界政治经济危机日益加深的反映。由于资本主义世界的经济和金融危机恶性发展，意大利的经济情况越来越不妙。意大利的垄断资产阶级为了转嫁经济困难，拚命加强对劳动人民的剥削。他们采取资本集中、企业合并以及所谓“生产机械化”和“合理化”等措施，造成大批工人失业。意大利统治集团实行向劳动人民开刀的反动经济政策，自然要遭到广大人民强烈的反抗。政治觉悟日益提高的意大利人民，越来越认识到，要改变自己的处境，就必须推翻腐朽的资本主义制度。今天的意大利就象是一个火药桶，一颗火星就可以引起一场斗争的烈火。
    触发这次意大利人民斗争新风暴的直接导火线，是意大利反动当局悍然指使警察枪杀罢工工人。反动派总是以为，他们用刺刀和枪弹，就可以吓倒人民，扑灭反抗。但事实恰恰相反，反动派越是进行血腥镇压，革命的力量就越发展。正如伟大的列宁说过的：“既然群众已经振作起来，既然千百万人已经开始行动起来，那末任何迫害和任何镇压都不能阻挡运动。迫害只能激起斗争，使愈来愈多的新战士卷入斗争。”意大利革命群众运动风暴的猛烈发展，又一次证明了这个马克思列宁主义的真理。
    意大利人民目前掀起的斗争新高潮，是今春欧洲、北美爆发的伟大革命风暴的继续，是整个资本主义世界革命群众运动的组成部分。以美国为首的帝国主义被“五月风暴”吓破了胆，千方百计地企图平息人民群众的斗争浪潮，稳定垄断资产阶级的反动统治。以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义，也大卖力气地出来维护垄断资产阶级的“法律和秩序”，竭力阻挡广大人民起来造反。但是，资本主义国家的革命群众运动，好象大海的怒涛，不断地冲破帝国主义及其走狗所设置的堤坝，奔腾向前。合众国际社最近忧心忡忡地叫喊说：“欧洲动荡的秋天正发展成骚乱的冬天”。这清楚地反映了以美国为首的帝国主义对于欧洲革命群众运动不断高涨的极端恐惧心理。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”今天，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主革命和欧洲、北美、大洋洲的革命群众运动，汇合成为一支巨大的革命洪流，猛烈地冲击着整个旧世界。全世界革命人民联合起来，坚持战斗，就一定能够把帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派统统葬入坟墓！
