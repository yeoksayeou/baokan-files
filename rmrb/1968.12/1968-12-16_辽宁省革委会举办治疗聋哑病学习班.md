Starting from raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, the advanced experience of the medical team of the People's Liberation Army's 3125 Unit is promoted.

The Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held a training class for young medical and nursing personnel from various cities and counties in the province to treat deaf-mute diseases. The class started by raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines and promoted the advanced experience of the medical team of the People's Liberation Army's 3125 Unit in using acupuncture to treat deaf-mute diseases.

The advanced experience of the medical team of the People's Liberation Army's 3125 Unit was summarized from their practical treatment at the deaf-mute school in Fuxian County, Liaoning. After treatment, all 105 deaf-mute students in the school regained their hearing and speaking abilities. This advanced experience opened up a new way for treating deaf-mute diseases. To promote their experience, the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee invited a group of young medical and nursing personnel, as well as deaf-mute teachers and nurses from various cities and counties in the province, to attend the training class.

In the training class, the medical team first organized the students to study Chairman Mao's important instructions on medical and health work. Together with the deaf-mute patients and their families, they fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants used a large number of facts to denounce the oppression of the exploiting classes on the health of the laboring people in the old society, causing the laboring people to suffer from illnesses that could not be treated. They criticized Liu Shaoqi's crimes in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line. The comrades from the PLA medical team shared their experiences of firmly implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian health line, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the treatment of diseases. Through the study, the students greatly raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, established the determination and confidence to quickly master medical techniques to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian health line and relieve the suffering of their class brothers and sisters with deaf-mute diseases.

In the technical learning and treatment practice, this training class prioritized arming the students with Mao Zedong Thought, helping them establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. They often organized the students to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies of "technology first," and planting the roots of emphasizing proletarian politics in their minds. At the same time, they often held meetings to share experiences of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the treatment of diseases, propagating and promoting the advanced examples and experiences among the students. Wang Yonghong, a deaf-mute teacher of worker origin, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people wholeheartedly," and practiced the acupuncture techniques repeatedly on himself. He quickly mastered the treatment techniques. Twenty-four deaf-mute patients were treated by her for ten days, and fifteen were cured, with the rest also showing good therapeutic effects. The training class promptly promoted her experience, which greatly encouraged all the students. Everyone expressed their determination to learn treatment techniques by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian health line, and to treat their class brothers and sisters with deaf-mute diseases with deep proletarian feelings. The students' class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines were continuously raised, and they quickly mastered the techniques, with the therapeutic effects becoming better and better.

Now, after more than twenty days of political study and technical training, the students of this training class have generally raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and mastered the techniques for treating deaf-mute diseases. The least number of patients they have treated has been six. In a deaf-mute factory and two deaf-mute schools in Shenyang, they used only more than ten days to make more than 90% of the 1,350 deaf-mute patients show obvious therapeutic effects.

    从提高路线斗争觉悟入手推广人民解放军三一二五部队医疗队先进经验
    辽宁省革委会举办治疗聋哑病学习班
    学习班首先用毛泽东思想武装学员的头脑，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想；同时组织学员狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线。学员们路线斗争觉悟不断提高，掌握技术很快，治疗效果越来越好
    据新华社沈阳十五日电　辽宁省革命委员会最近为全省各市、县的青年医护人员等举办治疗聋哑病的学习班，从提高学员两条路线斗争觉悟入手，推广人民解放军三一二五部队毛泽东思想医疗卫生工作队用针灸治疗聋哑病的经验。
    人民解放军三一二五部队毛泽东思想医疗卫生工作队的经验，是他们在辽宁复县聋哑学校治疗实践中总结出来的。经过治疗，全校一百零五名聋哑学生都恢复了听觉和说话的功能。这一先进经验为治疗聋哑病开创了新路子。辽宁省革委会为了推广他们的经验，从全省各市、县调来一批青年医护人员和聋哑教员、护理员，办起了学习班。医疗队在学习班里，首先组织学员学习毛主席对医疗卫生工作的一系列重要指示，跟聋哑病人和他们的家长一起，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线。工人、贫下中农以大量的事实，控诉了旧社会剥削阶级摧残劳动人民健康，造成劳动人民有病不能治的痛苦；批判了刘少奇推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的罪行。解放军医疗队的同志，向大家介绍了自己坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指挥治病的体会。学员们通过学习，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，树立了为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线、为解除患聋哑病的阶级兄弟的痛苦而迅速掌握医疗技术的决心和信心。
    这个学习班在技术学习和治疗实践中，把用毛泽东思想武装学员的头脑放在首位，帮助学员树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想。他们经常组织学员开展革命大批判，狠批刘少奇散布的“技术第一”的反动谬论，在头脑里扎下突出无产阶级政治的根子。同时，经常举行用毛泽东思想指挥治病的讲用会，宣传和推广学员中的先进典型和经验。工人出身的聋哑教师王永红，遵照毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，顽强地在自己身上反复练习针法，很快掌握了治疗技术。有二十四名聋哑病人，经过她十天的治疗就治愈十五名，其余病人也收到良好的疗效。学习班及时推广了她的经验，使全体学员受到很大鼓舞。大家都表示要象王永红那样活学活用毛主席著作，为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线学习治疗技术，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情为聋哑的阶级兄弟治疗。学员们阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，掌握技术很快，治疗效果越来越好。
    现在，这个学习班的学员经过二十多天的政治学习和技术训练，普遍提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，掌握了治疗聋哑的技术，最少的也已治愈了六个聋哑病人。他们在沈阳一个聋哑工厂、两个聋哑学校治疗中，仅用十多天的时间，就使一千三百五十名聋哑病人百分之九十以上都有了明显的疗效。
