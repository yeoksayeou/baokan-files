From the radio, we heard the report from Lake Yang County, Le Yuan Commune in Hubei Province, "The Cooperative Medical System Warmly Welcomed by Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants," and the important editorial note from the People's Daily. The poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune are all overjoyed. Everyone says, this is the greatest care and protection from the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

In June of this year, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune, following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," and in accordance with the wishes of us poor and lower-middle peasants, just like Le Yuan Commune, implemented a brand-new cooperative medical system. Practice has proven: the cooperative medical system is excellent! This is a truly good system that serves us poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is the direction of the rural medical and health revolution. In just over five months, the cooperative medical system has fully demonstrated its superiority.

1. The greatest advantage of implementing the cooperative medical system is that we poor and lower-middle peasants can firmly grasp the power of rural medical and health undertakings, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian health line. Before our commune implemented the cooperative medical system, due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents, the medical power of the commune health center was long controlled by a handful of Nationalist Party remnants. They did not serve the poor and lower-middle peasants at all. After implementing the cooperative medical system in June, under the leadership of the commune revolutionary committee, we seized the medical power, established the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Cooperative Medical Management Committee, and put the power of the commune health center in the hands of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

2. Implementing the cooperative medical system solves the problem of poor and lower-middle peasants lacking money to treat diseases. In the past, due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, a fee system was established to exploit the poor and lower-middle peasants. Without three or five yuan, you couldn't see a doctor, and without thirty yuan, you couldn't stay in the hospital. After implementing the cooperative medical system, each person contributes one fen per month, and the brigade's public welfare fund supplements one fen and five fen. With the cooperative medical certificate, paying five fen for registration allows you to see a doctor. Minor injuries and illnesses of the poor and lower-middle peasants can be treated in time, and even if they get serious illnesses, they don't have to worry about not having money to treat them. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "This is all thanks to Chairman Mao."

3. Implementing the cooperative medical system is beneficial for implementing the "prevention first" policy. In the past, due to the capitalist management of many rural medical departments pushed by the capitalist-roaders following the "self-sustaining" revisionist medical and health line, preventive work was not carried out. Additionally, some epidemics required preventive medication, but the poor and lower-middle peasants could not afford the medication fees, so preventive measures could not be promoted. After implementing the cooperative medical system, rural medical and health undertakings are directly managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, who can start from the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants, organize medical staff to regularly propagate health knowledge to the masses, carry out patriotic health campaigns, and timely take preventive medication, etc. This way, the "prevention first" policy can truly be implemented.

4. Implementing the cooperative medical system, the poor and lower-middle peasants grasp the power of medical and health undertakings, and can better re-educate medical staff, establishing a medical and health team of their own. If medical staff have problems in their thoughts or work, the poor and lower-middle peasants will timely educate and help them, and organize medical staff to regularly participate in collective production labor, participate in the class struggle of the commune, and learn the class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants loving Chairman Mao and loving socialism. Medical staff have become commune members, and their relationship with the poor and lower-middle peasants has become increasingly close.

In implementing the cooperative medical system, we solved several problems as follows:

1. At the beginning of implementing the cooperative medical system, someone raised the question: "If medication is free, won't the number of people seeing a doctor increase, leading to overspending?" In response to this question, we first did good political and ideological work, making the broad poor and lower-middle peasants understand the great significance of implementing the cooperative medical system, correctly handling the relationship between the individual and the collective. Secondly, we seriously implemented the "prevention first" policy, achieving early treatment of minor illnesses and early prevention of major illnesses, reducing expenses. Thirdly, to ensure the reasonable use of cooperative medical funds, we made some specific regulations. For example: if the treatment cost per person per illness exceeds one hundred yuan, the excess amount will be resolved by the individual and the production team through consultation, and the cost will be appropriately reduced or waived according to the patient's economic situation after discussion by the poor and lower-middle peasants; the treatment cost for acute exacerbations of chronic diseases will be covered by the cooperative medical funds, general chronic disease medication costs will be self-managed, non-treatment medication and tonic costs will be self-managed, and surgical costs for some diseases that do not affect health (such as body odor, lipoma) will be self-managed. Due to the adoption of the above measures, in the past few months, our commune's cooperative medical fund has not only not been overspent but has also had a surplus.

2. Someone raised the question: after implementing the cooperative medical system, won't the number of people going to the commune health center for treatment increase, leading to a shortage of doctors? The solution to this problem is to train a batch of semi-agricultural and semi-medical medical staff, strengthen the brigade medical staff's mobile medical treatment, and achieve general disease diagnosis and treatment without leaving the brigade. This greatly reduces the number of people going to the commune health center for treatment and also allows medical staff to regularly go to the brigades to carry out health prevention work.

3. Someone raised the question: can the children of landlords and rich peasants participate in the cooperative medical system? We, based on the party's class policy, based on the political, ideological, and labor performance of the landlord and rich peasant children themselves, discuss and decide whether they can participate. However, it is better to absorb them after the cooperative medical system has been consolidated.

### 合作医疗制度好得很

    合作医疗制度好得很
    从广播里听到湖北省长阳县乐园公社《深受贫下中农欢迎的合作医疗制度》的报道和《人民日报》的重要编者按后，我们公社贫下中农都高兴极了。大家说，这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部对我们贫下中农的最大关怀，最大爱护。
    今年六月，我们公社贫下中农在毛主席革命路线的光辉照耀下，遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大教导，按照我们贫下中农的心意，和乐园公社一样，实现了崭新的合作医疗制度。实践证明：合作医疗制度好得很！这是真正为我们贫下中农服务的好制度，是农村医疗卫生革命的方向。在短短的五个多月里，合作医疗制度已经充分显示了优越性。
    一、实行合作医疗制度最大的优越性，是我们贫下中农能够牢牢地掌握农村医疗卫生事业的大权，保证毛主席无产阶级卫生路线的贯彻落实。我们公社实行合作医疗以前，由于大叛徒刘少奇及其代理人推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，使公社卫生所的医疗大权长期被一小撮国民党残渣余孽所把持，他们根本不为贫下中农服务。今年六月实现了合作医疗制度后，我们在公社革委会的领导下，夺回了医疗大权，成立了公社贫下中农合作医疗管理委员会，把公社卫生所的大权掌握在我们贫下中农手里。
    二、实行合作医疗，解决了贫下中农缺钱治病的困难。过去，由于大叛徒刘少奇推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，建立一套收费制度卡贫下中农。没有三元五元就别想请医生，没有三十元就别想住医院。实行合作医疗制度以后，每人每月自己出一角钱，从大队公益金中补助一角五分钱。凭合作医疗证，交五分钱挂号费就可以看病，贫下中农的小伤小病都能及时得到治疗，就是得了重病，也不愁无钱治病了。贫下中农说：“这完全是托毛主席他老人家的福。”
    三、实行合作医疗，有利于贯彻“预防为主”的方针。过去由于走资派推行“自负盈亏”的修正主义医疗卫生路线，致使农村许多医务部门进行资本主义经营，预防工作无人抓。加上有些流行病要吃预防药，贫下中农出不起药费，预防措施也就推广不开。实行合作医疗后，农村医疗卫生事业由贫下中农直接管理，就能从贫下中农的利益出发，组织医务人员经常向群众宣传卫生知识，开展爱国卫生运动，及时服预防药等等。这样，就能真正落实“预防为主”的方针。
    四、实行合作医疗制度，贫下中农掌握了医疗卫生大权，能够更好地对医务人员进行再教育，建立一支贫下中农自己的医疗卫生队伍。发现医务人员思想上、工作上有问题，贫下中农就及时对他们进行教育和帮助，并组织医务人员经常参加集体生产劳动，参加公社的阶级斗争，学习贫下中农热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义的阶级感情。医务人员成了公社社员，同贫下中农的关系也越来越亲密了。
    在实行合作医疗中，有几个问题我们是这样解决的：
    一、在开始办合作医疗时，有人提出“吃药不要钱，看病的人增多，超支怎么办？”针对这个问题，我们首先做好政治思想工作，使广大贫下中农明确实行合作医疗的重大意义，正确处理个人与集体的关系。其次，认真贯彻“预防为主”的方针，做到小病早治，大病早防，减少费用。再次，为了使合作医疗经费合理使用，还作了一些具体规定。如：每人每次生病的治疗费用超过一百元的，超过部分就由本人和生产队协商解决，根据病人的经济情况，经贫下中农讨论酌情减免；慢性病急性发作的治疗费用由合作医疗经费内开支，一般慢性病的药费用自理，非治疗药品和补药费用自理，对一些不影响健康的疾病（如狐臭、脂肪瘤）施行手术费用自理。由于采取了上述措施，几个月来我们公社的合作医疗基金不但没有超支，并有结余。
    二、有人提出：实现合作医疗后，到公社卫生所看病的人数增加，医生不够怎么办？解决这个问题的办法是，培训一批半农半医的医务人员，卫生所医务人员加强下队巡回医疗，做到一般的病诊治不出队。这样大大减少了到公社卫生所就诊的人数，还可以使医务人员经常下队开展卫生预防工作。
    三、有人提出：地富子女能不能参加合作医疗。我们根据党的阶级政策，根据地富子女本人的政治、思想、劳动的表现，由贫下中农讨论，本人表现好的可以参加。不过，应在合作医疗制度得到巩固以后，再行吸收为宜。
