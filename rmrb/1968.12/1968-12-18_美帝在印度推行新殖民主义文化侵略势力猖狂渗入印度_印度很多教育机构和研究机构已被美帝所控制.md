	The U.S. imperialists' cultural aggression has become increasingly rampant in India over the past twenty years. Currently, a significant portion of India's higher education and research institutions are under American control. According to various "cultural exchange" programs, over 60,000 Indian students, teachers, and experts have been sent to the United States.

	Indian newspapers report that the U.S. "education and cultural exchange program" with India was initiated in 1950 under the Fulbright Act. In 1951, the U.S. enacted the so-called "Indian Emergency Food Aid Act," stipulating that the principal and interest on the repayment of U.S. "aid" grain by India should be deposited in a special account under the U.S. Treasury Department. This fund is used to "assist" Indian students, professors, and other academics in "research, guidance, technical training, and other educational activities"; and to donate books and technical equipment to Indian higher education and research institutions. Indian newspapers also report that within just ten years, the U.S. used the privileges granted by this act to effectively control a significant portion of India's higher education and research institutions. Subsequently, the U.S. obtained additional privileges under other acts, amassing over 18.2 billion rupees. This fund has become an important resource for U.S. aggressive activities.

	Indian newspapers point out that U.S. cultural aggression takes various forms, including "exchanging" students, providing textbooks, conducting summer courses, exchanging newspaper editorials and radio programs, holding concerts, and staging performances. The goal of these activities is to make Indian youth accept the influence of the "American way of life" in their thoughts and spirits, and to cultivate various figures to meet the needs of U.S. aggression.

	Indian newspapers also reveal that institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Socialist Youth Union, and the National Student Association are all "channels" used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for cultural infiltration and the recruitment and training of U.S. agents.

	In some high-level educational and research institutions in India that receive U.S. financial "aid," a large number of American "experts" have been placed. These institutions include the Naini Agricultural College, the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, the University of Agriculture in Uttar Pradesh, the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, and the Institute of Business Management. Additionally, the CIA's "Peace Corps" has over 500 people conducting espionage activities under the guise of cultural and technical "aid" in various parts of India.

	Indian newspapers state that publishing American books is another important aspect of U.S. cultural infiltration. These books are nominally published by Indian publishers, but the translation fees are fully paid by the U.S. Information Service, and the publication costs are partially subsidized by the U.S. Some so-called series are entirely funded by U.S. institutions in India.

	The U.S. cultural aggression against India is part of its overall aggressive activities to impose neocolonialism and turn India into a colony. The U.S.'s rampant aggression has sparked increasingly strong resistance from the Indian people.

    美帝在印度推行新殖民主义文化侵略势力猖狂渗入印度
    印度很多教育机构和研究机构已被美帝所控制
    本报讯　据印度报刊报道，最近二十年以来，美帝国主义的文化侵略势力越来越猖狂地渗入印度。目前，印度很大一部分高等教育部门、研究部门都已为美国所控制。根据各种“文化交流”计划由印度派往美国的学生、教师、专家达六万人以上。
    印度报刊说，美国对印度的“教育和文化交流计划”是根据富布赖特法案在一九五○年开始执行的。一九五一年，美国通过所谓“印度紧急粮食援助法”，规定印度偿还美“援”粮食的本金的利息，都“应归入美国财政部特别存款账下”，用来“帮助”印度学生、教授和其他学术人员，从事“研究、指导、技术训练和其他教育活动”；向印度的高等教育部门和研究部门赠送书籍和技术设备。印度报刊又说，只经过十年时间，美国就利用这个法案所规定的特权，实际上控制了印度很大一部分高等教育和研究部门。以后美国又根据另一些法案所取得的特权，拥有了一百八十二亿卢比以上的巨额款项。这笔款项就成为美国进行侵略活动的重要资金。
    印度报刊指出，美国文化侵略活动是多种多样的，除了“交换”留学生、提供教科书、开办暑期学习班以外，还有交换报纸社论和电台节目，举办音乐会以及戏剧演出等。这些活动的目的，就是要使印度青年在思想上和精神上接受“美国生活方式”的影响；并培养适应美国侵略活动需要的各种人物。
    印度报刊还透露：美国的马萨诸塞理工学院、哈佛大学、密执安大学、福特基金会、洛克菲勒基金会、国际社会主义青年联盟、全国学生联盟等，都是美国中央情报局进行文化渗透、物色和培养美国代理人的“渠道”。
    在印度一些接受美国财政“资助”的高级教育和研究机关中，现在都安插了大批美国“专家”。这类机构有奈尼农学院、坎普尔印度理工学院、北方邦农业大学、全印医学科学院医院、商业管理学院等。另外，美国中央情报局的一个机构——“和平队”，也有五百多人在文化技术“援助”幌子下在印度各地进行特务活动。
    印度报刊说，出版美国书籍，也是美国文化渗透的一个重要内容。这些书籍，名义上由印度出版商出版，但是翻译费用全部由美国新闻处付给，出版费用也由美国给予部分津贴。有些所谓丛书，全部出版费用都由美国驻印机构提供。
    美帝对印度的文化侵略，是它在印度推行新殖民主义、把印度变为殖民地的整个侵略活动的一部分。美帝的这些猖狂侵略，激起了印度人民越来越强烈的反抗。
