Absolutely Must Not Abandon Class Struggle

Beijing Dongcheng District Paper Box Factory old worker, Song Guozhong

We workers deeply understand that to ensure we will never again be oppressed or exploited, and never again live a life worse than cattle, we must completely eliminate the capitalist regime. However, the great traitor, great internal spy, and great labor exploiter Liu Shaoqi, after our worker class took power, advocated that we workers should not struggle against the bourgeoisie but should "cooperate" with the capitalists. This is sheer nonsense.

We workers have a blood debt with the capitalists. The capitalists' paradise is our workers' hell. The capitalists' joy is our workers' pain. Every factory and shop owned by the capitalists was built with our workers' blood and sweat. The capitalists' history of getting rich is our workers' history of blood and tears. In short, as long as the capitalists are in power, there is no place for us workers. As the saying goes: Young people enter the factory, beatings are common; Politically oppressed, suffering with no one to tell; Economically exploited, suffering bitterly; Doing beastly work, eating bitter soup; Exhausted to the bone, money all deducted; Dead even more miserable, thrown to dogs and wolves. This is our workers' accusation against the capitalists! Ask the great labor exploiter Liu Shaoqi, can these two classes, one oppressing and the other oppressed, one exploiting and the other exploited, not engage in class struggle?

After liberation, when the proletariat seized power, the bourgeoisie also did not "cooperate" with the workers. They cut corners, stole state assets and economic information, sabotaged the socialist economy, and opposed the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. We workers, to consolidate the socialist economy, engaged in a head-on struggle with the capitalists. One wanted to develop capitalism, the other wanted to build socialism. Ask the great labor exploiter Liu Shaoqi, can these two fundamentally different paths cooperate?

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the bourgeoisie still did not behave. In 1957, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism; in 1959, they again launched a frenzied attack on the Party through their agents within the Party; in 1962, during the period of temporary difficulties in the national economy, the bourgeoisie's attacks on the Party and socialism became even more intense, attempting to overthrow the socialist economy and make China regress to a colony or semi-colony. Ask the great labor exploiter Liu Shaoqi, can these two classes, engaged in such fierce struggles, cooperate?

History tells us that whether before or after liberation, in economics, politics, or ideology, there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the worker class and the bourgeoisie. The worker class and the bourgeoisie are two opposing classes, walking two fundamentally different paths, and must not abandon class struggle.

Liu Shaoqi vigorously advocates that we workers should cooperate with the capitalists. His purpose is to make us forget the old society of exploitation, forget the capitalist's wolf-like nature, allow capitalism to grow and develop in our country, and replace proletarian dictatorship with bourgeois dictatorship. The great labor exploiter Liu Shaoqi is even more poisonous than a snake!

We are the worker class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closest to Chairman Mao, most loving of socialism, most hating of the old society, and deepest in grudges against the bourgeoisie. We must thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's "theory of class cooperation," thoroughly overthrow the bourgeoisie, and ensure that the socialist mountain remains firmly in the hands of the proletariat.

    绝对不能放弃阶级斗争
    北京东城区纸盒厂老工人　宋国忠
    我们工人阶级深深懂得，要想永远不再受压迫、受剥削，不再过牛马不如的生活，就必须彻底消灭资本主义的统治。可是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在我们工人阶级掌权后，还鼓吹要我们工人阶级不要同资产阶级进行斗争，而要与资本家“合作”，真是胡说八道。
    我们工人与资本家有着血海深仇，资本家的天堂，就是我们工人的地狱。资本家的欢乐，就是我们工人的痛苦。资本家的每座工厂、商店，都是我们工人用血汗建成的。资本家的发家史，就是我们工人的血泪史。总之，资本家坐天下，就没有我们工人的活路。有道是：少年进工厂，打骂是经常；政治受压迫，有苦没处讲；经济受剥削，饱把苦头尝；干着牛马活，吃的苦菜汤；累得筋骨断，钱财全扣光；死了更可惨，扔给狗和狼。这就是我们工人对资本家的控诉！质问大工贼刘少奇，这样压迫和被压迫、剥削和被剥削的两个阶级，难道能不讲阶级斗争吗？
    解放了，无产阶级取得政权以后，资产阶级也是不会同工人阶级“合作”的。他们偷工减料，盗窃国家资财和经济情报，破坏社会主义经济，反对对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。我们工人阶级为了巩固社会主义经济，同资本家进行了针锋相对的斗争。一个要发展资本主义，一个要建设社会主义。质问大工贼刘少奇，这样根本不同的两条道路，能合作吗？
    在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，资产阶级也仍然没有老实过，也不跟工人阶级搞“合作”。一九五七年，资产阶级右派向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻；一九五九年，他们又通过在党内的代理人向党发动猖狂进攻；一九六二年国民经济暂时困难时期，资产阶级向党、向社会主义的进攻越发变本加厉，妄图一举搞垮社会主义经济，使中国大倒退到殖民地、半殖民地。质问大工贼刘少奇，进行着这样激烈斗争的两个阶级，能合作吗？
    历史的经验告诉我们，解放前也好，解放后也好，无论在经济上，政治上，还是思想上，工人阶级与资产阶级之间始终存在着不可调和的矛盾。工人阶级与资产阶级是两个对立的阶级，走着根本不同的两条路，决不能放弃阶级斗争。
    刘少奇极力要我们工人与资本家合作，他的目的就是要我们忘掉人剥削人的旧社会，忘掉资本家的豺狼本性，让资本主义在我国滋长发展，以便让资产阶级专政代替无产阶级专政。大工贼刘少奇比蛇蝎还毒三分哪！
    我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，对毛主席最亲，对社会主义最爱，对旧社会最恨，对资产阶级冤仇最深。我们一定要彻底批判刘少奇的“阶级合作论”，彻底推翻资产阶级，使社会主义江山牢牢掌握在无产阶级手里。
