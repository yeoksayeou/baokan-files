Forever Make Mao Zedong Thought the Main Course

Old poor peasant and active learner and user of Chairman Mao's works, Zhu Zhaoqing

The counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line has countless rules and regulations. Entering the school gate is just the beginning; once inside, everything must be done according to the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line's rules and regulations. For example, in the matter of what to learn and what not to learn, the school has it all boxed in tightly. It wants students to learn only the black goods of the feudal, capitalist, and revisionist classes, and not to learn Chairman Mao's works.

The traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi openly said, "Do not quote Chairman Mao's words, just say it as if it were in the textbook," and also said, "Studying only the Selected Works of Mao Zedong is not enough." He proposed, "The Bible should be studied, and the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government can also be studied." Liu Shaoqi opposed students studying Mao Zedong Thought, advocating the study of the Bible, his evil intention is clear: he wants to block the radiant Mao Zedong Thought and is afraid that the broad masses of young people will grasp Mao Zedong Thought and rise up against him. He wants young people to bury their heads in ancient books and follow his directive to restore capitalism. The wings of a crow cannot cover the sun's brilliance. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, and Liu Shaoqi has revealed his true colors as a traitor, spy, and renegade.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Liu Shaoqi opposes the study of Mao Zedong Thought, so we must launch a mass movement to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. After we poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the school, we must place Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. We must make Mao Zedong Thought a main course for students, making the "Three Articles" a must-read for every student, turning the school into a red Mao Zedong Thought university. Only in this way can the school cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. On this issue, I have some personal experience. I am sixty years old this year and began studying Mao Zedong Thought in 1965. Before and after studying, I clearly felt a difference in my spiritual outlook. Before studying Mao Zedong Thought, I often thought about not having a son, seeing that I could no longer work, and wondering who I would rely on in the future. Sometimes I felt pessimistic and disappointed. After studying Mao Zedong Thought, especially after studying the "Three Articles," Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the "Old Fool" seemed to stand before my eyes, and I felt short by half. I thought: I am an old party member, and in the past, I have done very little beneficial work for the party and the people. I should take advantage of the time I can still work to do more good for the party and the people. In 1966, everyone elected me and two other elderly people to manage the field. I happily accepted. Over the years, as long as it is a clear day, there are several thousand pounds of grain coming in and out every day. Although the workload is large, we work with great interest and do not feel tired. The grain managed by our team has not gone bad, and dozens of varieties of rice and wheat are clearly sorted. I am not telling this story to praise my personal merits, but to say that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, bravest, and most combat-effective. Why can I do this good deed for the collective? It is the strength given to me by Mao Zedong Thought. I think that the school managed by us poor and lower-middle peasants must forever make Mao Zedong Thought the main course, mobilize teachers and students to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Our country will never change color.

    这里选登的江苏省邗江县汊河公社立坝大队贫下中农、农村教师批判反革命修正主义教育路线的文章，用活生生的事实揭露了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇反对学习毛主席著作、排斥贫下中农子女入学的滔天罪行，批判了他所散播的种种谬论，象一把把利剑，直刺刘少奇修正主义教育路线的要害。　——编者
    永远把毛泽东思想作主课
    老贫农、活学活用毛主席著作积极分子　朱兆庆
    反革命修正主义教育路线的条条框框多如牛毛。跨进学校大门固然要经过很多关口，进了学校也得按反革命修正主义教育路线的条条框框办事。比如在学什么，不学什么的问题上，学校也把它框得死死的。要学生尽学封、资、修的黑货，不让学生学毛主席著作。
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇明目张胆地说：“不要摘引毛主席的话，就当课本上的话说”，又说“只学毛选不行”。他提出“《圣经》要学，《资治通鉴》也可以学。”刘少奇反对学生学习毛泽东思想，提倡学习什么《圣经》，他的罪恶目的是明显的，就是企图封锁光芒四射的毛泽东思想，就是害怕广大青少年一代掌握毛泽东思想，起来造他的反。他叫青少年埋头读古书，顺着他那复辟资本主义的指挥棒转。乌鸦的翅膀决不能遮住太阳的光辉。战无不胜的毛泽东思想空前普及了，刘少奇现出了叛徒、内奸、工贼的原形。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”刘少奇反对学习毛泽东思想，我们就是要开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。我们贫下中农管理学校以后，就是要把毛泽东思想放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，把毛泽东思想作为学生的一门主课，要把“老三篇”作为每个学生的必读篇，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。只有这样，学校里才能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人。在这个问题上，我是有些切身的体会的。我今年六十岁，是一九六五年开始学习毛泽东思想的。学习前后，自己明显地觉得精神面貌不同了。在学习毛泽东思想之前，我常常想到自己没有儿子，眼看着做不动了，日后依靠谁呢？这么一想，有时就有些悲观失望了。学习毛泽东思想以后，尤其是学习了“老三篇”以后，张思德、白求恩、“老愚公”三个人好象站在我的眼前，我觉得矮了半截。我就想到：我是个老党员，过去为党、为人民做的有益的事情太少了，应当趁我还能干的时候，多为党、为人民做点好事。一九六六年，大伙儿推选我和另外两个老年人管理场头，我乐意地接受了。几年来，只要是晴天，每天都有几千斤粮食进出，虽然劳动量很大，但我们干得很有兴趣，就不知道劳累。队里经我们保管的粮食没有霉烂的，几十种稻麦品种也分得清清爽爽。我讲这件事，并不是来表扬我个人的功劳，而是说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最聪明、最勇敢、最有战斗力。我为什么能为集体做出这点好事？就是毛泽东思想给我增加的力量。我想，我们贫下中农管理的学校，必须永远把毛泽东思想作主课，发动师生认真学习毛泽东思想，按照毛主席的指示办事，我们国家就永远不会改变颜色。
