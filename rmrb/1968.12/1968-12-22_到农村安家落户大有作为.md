Title: There is Great Potential in Settling Down in Rural Areas

The great leader Chairman Mao says: "The countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." In the midst of the great struggle to criticize and reform, the broad masses of young intellectuals, with the support of revolutionary parents, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly taking the bright path of integrating with workers and peasants, and launched a wave of going to the mountains and countryside. Many young intellectuals, with great aspirations and vigorous spirits, went to the countryside to settle down. With their revolutionary actions, they strongly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. They are truly the youth of the Mao Zedong era. However, some parents and young intellectuals say: "Wait a while." "Wait a while" has issues of understanding and stance. Its essence is unwillingness to go to the countryside to settle down and unwillingness to accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. They have various "reasons" for "waiting":

First, they say: "Wait for others to go first." "The child has never left the parents since young, and it's not reassuring to go to the countryside." It seems that parents are very concerned about their children. However, keeping the children by their side, seemingly loving them, actually harms them. This will make them go against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, harming them for a lifetime. Sending the children to the countryside, handing them over to the poor and lower-middle peasants, letting them follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao, and walk the bright road of integrating with workers and peasants, should be very reassuring.

Second, they say: "Wait to go to the factory." "Many people have gone out from the factory to join the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and factories and mines will need a large number of people." It seems that there are sufficient reasons, but in reality, it is a longing for the city and a preference for industry over agriculture. They are afraid of the hardships in the countryside and afraid of the labor in the countryside. It is true that labor in the countryside is more arduous than "eating idly" in the city, but as Chairman Mao teaches us: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." Through this great Cultural Revolution, we should even more establish the idea of honoring hardship. Moreover, a hard environment can better temper young people.

Third, they say: "Wait to go to college." "There are still people going to college." It seems reasonable, but this is precisely falling into the poison of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory. Allowing this idea of despising workers and peasants to develop is very dangerous. Today, the socialist new countryside is the broadest expanse, it is the best "university."

Sending young intellectuals to the mountains and countryside is the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao for young intellectuals, an important way to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, a long-term strategy to prevent revisionism, and a social revolution to change customs. It is also a great ideological revolution to break with the old and establish the new. It will inevitably encounter some resistance. This resistance comes from the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class, and at the same time, a small handful of class enemies will also use the "self" in people's minds, pretending to care for the youth, spreading all kinds of rumors, trying to achieve their evil purpose of sabotaging young intellectuals going to the mountains and countryside. We must not be fooled!

Revolution must be done without delay. Revolutionary parents: immediately mobilize and support your children to go to the countryside, roll in the mud, and temper a red heart. Do not wait at all, and strive for every moment!

    到农村安家落户大有作为
    南京肉类联合加工厂　秦志法
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”在伟大的斗、批、改的高潮中，广大知识青年，在革命家长的支持下，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚定地走同工农相结合的光辉道路，掀起了上山下乡的热潮。不少知识青年胸怀壮志，英姿勃勃地到农村安家落户。他们以自己的革命行动，有力地批判了大叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，他们不愧为毛泽东时代的青年。但是，也有少数家长和知识青年却说什么：“等一等”。“等一等”，有认识问题，也有立场问题。其实质是不愿到农村去安家落户，不愿接受贫下中农的再教育。他们还有种种“等一等”的“理由”：
    一曰：等人家先走。“孩子从小就没有离开父母，下农村不放心。”看来父母对孩子十分关切。然而，把孩子留在自己身边，貌似爱之，其实害之。这会使他们同毛主席革命路线背道而驰，害了他们一辈子。把孩子送到乡下去，交给贫下中农，让他们沿着毛主席指引的革命方向，走同工农相结合的光明大道，应该是大大的放心。
    二曰：等进工厂。“工厂出去了很多人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队，厂矿会大量要人。”看来似乎理由十足，其实是留恋城市，重工轻农。他们怕农村艰苦，怕农村劳累。不错，在农村劳动当然比在城市“吃闲饭”要艰苦些，但是正如毛主席所教导我们的：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”通过这场伟大的文化大革命，我们更应该树立以艰苦为荣的思想。何况，艰苦的环境，更能锻炼青年人。
    三曰：等升学。“升学还是要有人的。”看来好象堂堂正正，其实这正是中了大叛徒刘少奇“读书做官论”的流毒。让这种轻视工农的思想发展下去是十分危险的。今天，社会主义的新农村，是最广阔的天地，是最好最好的“大学”。
    知识青年上山下乡是毛主席给知识青年指出的光明大道，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径，是反修防修的千年大计，是一场移风易俗的社会大革命，也是一场破旧立新、破私立公的思想大革命。它必然会遇到一定的阻力，这种阻力来自剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，同时，一小撮阶级敌人也会利用人们头脑里的“私”字，装成关心青年的样子，散布种种流言蜚语，妄图达到他们破坏知识青年上山下乡的罪恶目的。我们千万不要上当！
    革命要干不能等。革命的家长们：立即动员和支持自己的子女到农村去，滚一身泥巴，炼一颗红心。万万等不得，要“只争朝夕”！
