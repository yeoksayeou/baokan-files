Knowledgeable youth going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is very necessary. We must persuade urban cadres and others to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, and university to the countryside, and mobilize them to go. Comrades in the countryside should welcome them.

The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the greatest concern, care, encouragement, and motivation for young intellectuals, a great strategic measure to prevent and combat revisionism, a long-term plan to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, and a reliable guarantee to ensure that the proletarian iron mountain of our country will never change color.

Whether a revolutionary cadre can firmly support his children going to the countryside is a major issue of whether he executes or does not execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions, whether he is loyal or disloyal to Chairman Mao, whether he is loyal or disloyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and whether he is loyal or disloyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

My eldest son, Kaijian, graduated this year. Although this child was born in the new society and grew up under the red flag, due to the nineteen years since liberation, the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi has implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the field of education, allowing bourgeois intellectuals to control our schools. The child has received bourgeois education and does not understand what class is and what exploitation is. This is very dangerous.

This year, when the Party issued the great call to graduates of junior high schools, senior high schools, and universities to "face four directions" (face the countryside, face factories and mines, face the grassroots, and face the border), I was overjoyed from the bottom of my heart and immediately mobilized my child to respond to the Party's call, go to the countryside to settle down, and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

Before the child went down, I called him to my side, and together we studied the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao on "the countryside is a vast world, where one can achieve great things." At the same time, I told him about our family history and the history of the revolutionary struggle, awakened his class consciousness, and together with him criticized Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. I encouraged him to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly change his old thoughts. I repeatedly instructed the child that poor and lower-middle peasants are your parents, and the countryside is your home. You must think what poor and lower-middle peasants think, worry about what poor and lower-middle peasants worry about, and be heart to heart with poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly accept the re-education of poor and lower-middle peasants. The child was very excited and stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, holding the red book, swearing to the great leader Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I will definitely listen to your words, resolutely walk the bright path you point out, accept the re-education of poor and lower-middle peasants, and become a new peasant with socialist consciousness and culture."

After Kaijian went to the countryside, he often wrote to me, talking about the excellent situation in the countryside, talking about the class education that poor and lower-middle peasants gave him, reporting his ideological gains, and expressing his determination to dedicate his youth to the new socialist countryside. Seeing the child grow up healthily, I am infinitely grateful to our great leader Chairman Mao. I want to shout a thousand times and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

    听毛主席的话，把孩子送到农村去
    中国人民解放军某部副师长　侯树声
　　知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。
    伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的发表，是对知识青年最大的关怀、最大的爱护、最大的鼓舞、最大的鞭策，是防修反修的伟大战略措施，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的百年大计，是使我国无产阶级铁打江山永不变色的可靠保证。
    一个革命干部，能不能坚决支持自己的子女到农村去，这是执行不执行毛主席最新指示，忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题。
    我的大儿子开建，今年毕业了。这孩子虽然生在新社会，长在红旗下，但是，由于解放十九年来，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在教育战线上推行了一条反革命修正主义路线，让资产阶级知识分子统治了我们的学校，孩子接受的是资产阶级教育，不懂得什么是阶级，什么是剥削。这是十分危险的。
    今年，当党向大、中学校毕业生发出“四个面向”（面向农村，面向工矿，面向基层，面向边疆）的伟大号召时，我打心眼里高兴，立即动员自己的孩子响应党的号召，到农村安家落户，走与工农相结合的道路。
    在孩子下去前，我把孩子叫到身边，一起学习我们伟大领袖毛主席关于“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”的教导，同时，向他讲了家史和革命斗争史，启发他的阶级觉悟，同他一起批判刘少奇的“读书做官论”等反革命修正主义黑货，勉励他活学活用毛主席著作，到农村去接受贫下中农再教育，彻底改变旧思想。我一再叮嘱孩子，贫下中农就是你的父母，农村就是你的家，一定要想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急，同贫下中农心连心，虚心接受贫下中农的再教育。孩子很激动，站在毛主席像前，手捧红彤彤的宝书，向伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我一定听您的话，坚决走您指引的光明大道，接受贫下中农的再教育，做一个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的新农民。”
    开建到农村后，经常给我来信，谈农村的大好形势，谈贫下中农对他进行的阶级教育，汇报自己的思想收获，表示要把青春献给社会主义新农村。看到孩子健康地成长，我无限感激我们伟大的领袖毛主席，我要千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
