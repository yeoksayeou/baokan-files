The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most important issue for a school is to select the principal and teachers and to determine the educational policy." In the countryside, after the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of schools, how to establish a team of "village teachers" with high political awareness and experience in the three great revolutionary struggles is a very important issue. Recently, the facts investigated by the Jin County Revolutionary Committee in Dongli Village, Zongshizhuang, Xiaqiao, and Ma Yu in four communes fully prove this.

The "Village Teachers" Are Great

Now, the primary school teacher team in Jin County consists of two parts: one is the teachers sent by the county, who receive state salaries and are called county-appointed teachers; the other is the poor and lower-middle peasants who select knowledgeable youths, demobilized soldiers, and brigade cadres with experience in the three great revolutionary movements from their own villages to teach in their own villages, without receiving salaries, and the production team records their work points. The poor and lower-middle peasants affectionately call them "village teachers."

Most or all of the county-appointed teachers can integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and have achieved certain results in teaching, receiving the welcome of the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, compared with the "village teachers," the "village teachers" have more advantages:

First, the "village teachers" are selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants, making it convenient for the poor and lower-middle peasants to re-educate them and implement unified leadership. To grasp the power of culture, one must grasp the power of personnel. If the power of personnel is not grasped, the power of culture will still be lost. The "village teachers" are directly controlled by the poor and lower-middle peasants, making it convenient to establish a revolutionary teacher team with the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body. Among the 134 county-appointed teachers in these four communes, only 63 are from the poor and lower-middle peasants, accounting for 46.2% of the total number of county-appointed teachers; among the 145 "village teachers," 115 are from the poor and lower-middle peasants, accounting for 80.7% of the total number of "village teachers."

The "village teachers" come and go between the brigades. Who has what strengths and what weaknesses, the poor and lower-middle peasants know best, making it convenient to re-educate them. Therefore, the "village teachers" integrate well with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and their political awareness and teaching abilities improve quickly. Most or all of the county-appointed teachers can also integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants, but some regard themselves as "county-appointed" and detach themselves from the brigade leadership. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "The county-appointed teachers are in the village, but their power is in the county, making it inconvenient to manage and re-educate them." Some county-appointed teachers are deeply poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi and, to varying degrees, have the idea of looking down on workers and peasants, pursuing fame and wealth, and even some have led a corrupt life and taken the wrong path.

Second, the "village teachers" are the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the most intimate with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the most serious in implementing Chairman Mao's educational line. Chen Peng'e, a "village teacher" at Ma Yu Primary School in Ma Yu Commune, said, "Teaching is the greatest trust Chairman Mao has in us. If we cannot teach well, it is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao." She always uses Mao Zedong Thought to arm the students, studies Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions from Chairman Mao with the students, engages in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism together, helps students set up family Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and has become a model for primary school teachers throughout the commune. In the past three years, 65 "village teachers" from these four communes have been selected as active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought at the commune, county, and prefecture levels, accounting for 44.8% of the total number of "village teachers." The "village teachers" and the poor and lower-middle peasants have one heart, deeply understanding the pain of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lack of culture, and taking great care of the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Guo Ruixue, a "village teacher" in Zhongzuo Brigade, sees that a student's hair is long and dirty, and she cuts and washes the student's hair short and clean. Some children of the poor and lower-middle peasants have not yet bought the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and she buys it for the students with her own money. Many female "village teachers" often carry a sewing kit, and if a student's button falls off, they sew it on immediately. If the clothes are torn, they sew them up, and during rest time, they make shoes for the children of the poor peasants; if a student is sick, they call a doctor and buy medicine. The poor and lower-middle peasants are all very moved.

Third, in teaching, the "village teachers" can closely combine with the actual situation of the three great revolutionary struggles. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: Regarding the class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments in the village, the county-appointed teachers are far less familiar with the situation than the "village teachers." When the "village teachers" talk to the students about class struggle and conduct class education, they can link it to the village history and family history, making it vivid, and the students receive a deep education.

Most county-appointed teachers pay attention to learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants and understand some agricultural knowledge, which is very helpful for teaching agricultural knowledge courses. But some county-appointed teachers have not undergone labor tempering and do not pay attention to learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and many jokes have been made in teaching. One county-appointed teacher, when teaching an agricultural technology course to students, said that the medicine to treat corn borers is "1059" (medicine to treat cotton aphids), and the students laughed loudly. Another county-appointed teacher taught arithmetic by the book, by formulas, and could not combine it with reality, so the students learned it but could not use it. In the same school, a "village teacher" who had served as an accountant in the production team for two years broke the old framework of the textbook, reorganized the teaching materials according to the needs of the countryside, and completed a semester's arithmetic course in more than a month, teaching vividly and easily, making the students remember it well and use it, and the masses praised him as a "living teacher."

Fourth, the "village teachers" have the character of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the working people, which is beneficial for cultivating successors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The "village teachers" and the poor and lower-middle peasants are the same in three aspects: eating, dressing, and working. They are teachers and also commune members. All these set a good example for the students, making the students establish the idea of regarding the countryside as their home and regarding diligent work and plain living as honorable from an early age. Generally speaking, the living conditions of the county-appointed teachers are better, and their labor is worse than that of the "village teachers." In one school, two teachers went to participate in labor. When they returned, the "village teacher" patted off the dust and wiped the sweat, and then went to do what they should do. The county-appointed teacher washed from head to toe, leaving the students with a disgust for labor.

The Great Struggle Between the Two Lines

The growth process of this new type of teacher team is a process of struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines.

In 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, the educational cause in the countryside developed rapidly. Under this good situation, the poor and lower-middle peasants selected a group of outstanding young intellectuals from the village to serve as teachers, with the team recording their work points. That year, the four communes selected 60 "village teachers" and enrolled more than 2,400 students. As soon as the "village teachers" entered the school, they seriously implemented Chairman Mao's educational line and resisted Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Liu Shaoqi's agent in the local area turned red-eyed and shouted, "Teachers are state cadres and can only be appointed by the county, not selected by the team." He said nonsense like "the teachers selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants cannot teach and mislead the children." And so on. Thus, they began to harass, strike, persecute, and corrupt the "village teachers." Some were forced to leave school and return to the team, and some were lured away with salaries to become county-appointed teachers in other villages, and the 60 "village teachers" were almost all gone. In this way, this newly born "village teacher" team was strangled.

In 1959, the "village teachers" returned to the team. However, the class enemies did not give up and continued to harass and squeeze the "village teachers." The "village teachers," with a red heart to fight for Chairman Mao and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, persisted in the struggle and guarded their posts. In one school, the capitalist roaders and the capitalist roaders in the brigade colluded, squeezing the "village teachers" from the work points. The commune members worked one day and recorded six work points, but she taught one day and recorded one and a half work points. They tried to force her to leave school. But she firmly said: "Teaching is to defend Chairman Mao's educational line and to cultivate good successors for the poor and lower-middle peasants, not for work points. Even if work points are not given, I will still teach. Even if my head is cut off, I will still teach." She still insisted on teaching.

The Development Direction of Rural Primary School Teacher Team

From the many advantages and growth process of the "village teachers," it can be clearly seen that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "in the countryside, the school should be managed by the most reliable ally of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," to permanently grasp the power of education in the countryside in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and to make the educational cause forever advance along Chairman Mao's educational line, a team of such "village teachers" must be established. This requires:

First, in the future, when rural primary schools recruit new teachers, they should follow Chairman Mao's instruction on "selecting students from workers and peasants with practical experience" and select knowledgeable youths, demobilized soldiers, and brigade cadres with high political awareness, a certain level of culture, and experience in labor tempering from the poor and lower-middle peasants with practical experience to teach, with the team recording their work points. This is a major issue of whether the poor and lower-middle peasants can grasp the power of culture and rely on whom to run the school.

For this, the poor and lower-middle peasants should always pay attention to discovering and cultivating "village teachers" in the three great revolutionary struggles, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, re-educating them, raising their class consciousness, and letting them take on some deputy positions in the production team, such as production team leader, accountant, technician, electrician, and militia cadre, so that they can undergo the test of struggle and have a specialty. After teaching, it is beneficial to implement Chairman Mao's instruction on "students should also learn by doing, learn other things, that is, not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie," and cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Second, for the existing "village teachers," leadership should be strengthened, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes should be held continuously to help them, with Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles," a series of latest instructions, and Chairman Mao's educational line as the basic teaching materials, to re-educate them by the poor and lower-middle peasants, raise their political awareness, and change their worldview. At the same time, teaching experience should be summarized and exchanged continuously to gradually improve them, make inventions, and create, so that the "village teacher" team will grow and strengthen.

Third, for the existing county-appointed teacher team, it must be rectified and transformed. According to Chairman Mao's instruction on "students trained in old schools, most or all of them can integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct leadership, re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old ideas," most teachers who can integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers should be re-educated, hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Let them participate in the practice of class struggle and production struggle in the countryside, and organize them to participate in labor tempering in a planned and phased manner, thoroughly change their old ideas, and walk the road of integrating with workers and peasants.

Fourth, establish a teacher team combining full-time, part-time, and students as small teachers. Part-time teachers can invite deeply resentful poor and lower-middle peasants, experienced old peasants, active learners of Mao Zedong Thought, demobilized and transferred soldiers, Communist Party members, and old cadres to teach courses on class struggle and agricultural technology, help with military training, learn from the PLA's "Four Firsts" and "Three-Eight Style," etc.; the existing county-appointed teachers and "village teachers" are full-time teachers; according to Chairman Mao's instruction on "officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, and soldiers teach soldiers," let the students go on the platform to teach, so that teachers and students can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses and improve teaching.

In this way, a proletarian teacher team will gradually form, and the proletarian educational cause will rapidly advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

    “庄户教师”就是好
    ——河北晋县四个公社小学教师情况调查报告
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：一个学校“最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针”。在农村，贫下中农管理学校以后，怎样建立一支有高度政治觉悟，有三大革命斗争实践经验的“庄户教师”队伍，是一个很重要的问题。最近，晋县革委会在东里庄、总十庄、小樵、马于四个公社调查的事实，充分证明了这一点。
      “庄　户　教　师”　就　是　好
    现在，晋县的小学教师队伍由两部分人员组成：一是县里派去的教师，拿国家工资，叫县立教师；一是贫下中农从本村知识青年、荣复军人、队干部中选拔有三大革命运动实践经验的贫下中农子女在本村任教，不挣工资，由大队记工分。贫下中农亲切地称他们为“庄户教师”。
    县立教师多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，在教学上作出了一定成绩，受到贫下中农欢迎。但与“庄户教师”相比，“庄户教师”就有更多的优点：
    第一、“庄户教师”是贫下中农选拔的，便于贫下中农再教育，实行一元化领导。要掌握文权，就要掌握人事权，人事权掌握不了，文权还会失掉。“庄户教师”由贫下中农直接掌握，便于树立以贫下中农子女为主体的革命化的教师队伍。这四个公社的一百三十四名县立教师中，贫下中农出身的仅有六十三名，占县立教师总数百分之四十六点二；在一百四十五名“庄户教师”中，贫下中农出身的就有一百一十五名，占“庄户教师”总数的百分之八十点七。
      “庄户教师”队来队往，谁有什么长处，有什么缺点，贫下中农最清楚，便于给以再教育。因此，“庄户教师”与贫下中农结合得好，政治觉悟、教学能力提高得快。县立教师多数或大多数也能够同贫下中农结合，但有的以“县立”自居，脱离大队领导。贫下中农说：“县立教师人在村，权在县，管理不方便，不便给予再教育。”有的县立教师受大叛徒刘少奇修正主义教育路线的毒害较深，不同程度地存在着轻视工农、追逐名利的思想，甚至有的生活腐化，走上了错误的道路。
    第二、“庄户教师”对伟大领袖毛主席最忠，对贫下中农最亲，对贯彻毛主席的教育路线最认真。马于公社马于小学的“庄户教师”陈捧娥说，让咱教学是毛主席对咱最大的信任，教不好学，就是对毛主席的最大不忠。她处处用毛泽东思想武装学生，和学生一起学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席的最新指示，一起斗私批修，帮助学生大办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，成为全公社小学教师的榜样。近三年来，这四个公社的
  “庄户教师”，被评选为社、县、专区的活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子的有六十五人，占“庄户教师”总数的百分之四十四点八。“庄户教师”和贫下中农是一个心眼，最体贴贫下中农没有文化的痛苦，对贫下中农的子女关怀备至，体贴入微。中作大队的“庄户教师”郭瑞雪，看见学生的头发长了、脏了，她就给学生把头发剪短洗净。有的贫下中农子女还没买上《毛主席语录》，她就自己拿钱给学生买上。许多女“庄户教师”经常带着针线包，学生的扣子掉了立刻给缝上，衣服破了给缝好，并利用休息时间给贫农子女做鞋；学生病了，就请医生，买药。贫下中农都很感动。
    第三、“庄户教师”在教学上能够紧密结合三大革命运动的实际。贫下中农说：对村里的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，县立教师远不如“庄户教师”熟悉情况。“庄户教师”对学生讲阶级斗争，进行阶级教育，都能联系村史、家史，讲得生动，学生受教育深刻。
    多数县立教师注意向贫下中农学习，懂得一些农业知识，对上农业知识课很有帮助。但也有的县立教师既没有经过劳动锻炼，又不注意向贫下中农学习，教学中出了不少笑话。有一位县立教师，给学生讲农业技术课时，说治玉米钻心虫的药是“一○五九”（治棉蚜的药），学生哄堂大笑。还有一位县立教师讲算术课，就书本讲书本，就公式讲公式，不能联系实际，学生学了用不上。同一个学校的一位在生产队担任过两年会计的“庄户教师”，打破旧书本的框框，根据农村需要，重新组织教材，一个学期的算术课程只用了一个多月就讲完了，讲得生动，易懂，学生记得牢，用得上，群众称赞他是“活教书”。
    第四、“庄户教师”具有贫下中农和劳动人民的本色，有利于培养无限忠于毛主席，忠于无产阶级革命事业的接班人。“庄户教师”和贫下中农三个一样：吃饭穿衣一样，干活记工一样，思想感情一样。他们是教员，也是社员。这些，都给学生做出了好榜样，使学生从小就树立以农村为家，以勤奋劳动、艰苦朴素为荣的思想。县立教师，一般来说，生活比“庄户教师”高，劳动比“庄户教师”差。一个学校有两位教师去参加劳动，回来后，“庄户教师”拍一拍尘土，擦一擦汗，该干啥就干啥去了。那位县立教师，从头顶洗到脚下，给学生留下厌恶劳动的印象。
        两　条　路　线　的　大　搏　斗
    这支新型教师队伍的成长过程是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的过程。
    一九五八年，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，农村教育事业迅猛发展。在这种大好形势下，贫下中农从村里选拔了一批优秀知识青年担任教师，由队记工。这一年，四个公社就选拔了六十名“庄户教师”，收了两千四百多名学生。“庄户教师”一进学校，就认真贯彻毛主席的教育路线，抵制刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线。刘少奇在当地的代理人红了眼，跳出来大喊：“教师是国家干部，只能县派，不能队选。”胡说什么“贫下中农选的土先生，教不了学，误人子弟。”等等。于是就对“庄户教师”进行刁难、打击、迫害、腐蚀，有的被迫离校回队，有的以工资为诱饵，调到外村去当县立教师，六十名“庄户教师”几乎一人也没剩下。就这样，把这支新生的“庄户教师”队伍扼杀了。
    一九五九年，“庄户教师”重新归队了。但是，阶级敌人并未死心，仍然对“庄户教师”进行刁难、排挤。“庄户教师”怀着为毛主席争气、为贫下中农服务的一颗红心，坚持斗争，坚守岗位。有一个学校的走资派和大队走资派勾结，从工分上排挤“庄户教师”，社员劳动一天，记六分工，她教一天学，记一分五工。妄图以此迫她离校。但她毅然地说：“教学是为捍卫毛主席的教育路线，为贫下中农培养好后代，不是为工分，不给工分也要干，掉了脑袋也要干。”仍然坚持教学。
      农村小学教师队伍的发展方向
    从“庄户教师”的许多优点和成长过程，可以清楚地看出，要落实毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示，把农村教育大权永远掌握在贫下中农手里，使教育事业永远沿着毛主席的教育路线前进，必须建立这样的“庄户教师”队伍。这就要求：
    第一、今后农村小学吸收新教师，要遵照毛主席关于“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生”的教导，从有实践经验的贫下中农中，选拔有高度政治觉悟，有一定文化水平，经过两三年劳动锻炼，能联系群众的知识青年、复员军人、队干部当教师，由队记工分。这是贫下中农能不能掌好文权，靠什么人办学的大问题。
    为此，贫下中农要经常注意在三大革命斗争中，有计划地发现和培养“庄户教师”，用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑，给以再教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟，并让他们担任一些生产队副职，如生产队长、会计、技术员、电工、民兵干部等，使他们既经历斗争考验，又有一门专长，任教师后，有利于贯彻毛主席“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的指示，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    第二、对现有“庄户教师”要加强领导，应不断帮助他们举办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”、一系列最新指示和毛主席的教育路线为基本教材，由贫下中农给以再教育，提高政治觉悟，改造世界观。同时，要不断总结交流教学经验，使他们逐步提高，有所发明，有所创造，使“庄户教师”队伍不断成长壮大。
    第三、对现有县立教师队伍，必须加以整顿、改造。根据毛主席“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”的教导，对多数能够同工农兵结合的教师给以再教育，举办毛泽东思想学习班，彻底清除刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线流毒。让他们参加农村阶级斗争、生产斗争的实践，有计划地分期、分批组织他们参加劳动锻炼，彻底改变他们的旧思想，走与工农相结合的道路。
    第四、建立专职、兼职、学生当小先生相结合的教师队伍。兼职教师可聘请苦大仇深的贫下中农，有丰富实践经验的老农，学习毛泽东思想积极分子、复员转业军人、共产党员、老干部，担任阶级斗争、农业技术等课程，帮助搞军训，学习解放军的“四个第一”“三八作风”等；现有县立教师、“庄户教师”为专职教师；根据毛主席“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的教导，使学生走上讲台讲课，做到教师、学生互相取长补短，搞好教学。
    这样，一支无产阶级教师队伍就会逐步形成，无产阶级教育事业就会沿着毛主席指引的方向迅猛前进。
