According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on December 12, preliminary statistics show that from December 2 to 8, the people's patriotic armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand launched 25 attacks on the strongholds of the U.S.-Thanom-Praphat reactionary clique, ambushed and resisted reactionary military and police forces, and annihilated more than 30 enemy personnel. They also shot down and damaged multiple enemy helicopters, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy.

The radio station reported that the brave armed forces of Nakhon Thai County, Phetchabun Province, in close cooperation with the local people, ambushed enemy police convoys, "special forces," and armed patrols on December 10 and 11, and intercepted enemy reinforcements, killing and wounding six enemy personnel. The armed forces utilized favorable terrain to strike the enemy, leaving them in disarray.

The radio station also reported on December 13 that the flames of the Thai people's armed struggle are burning more fiercely, causing increasing panic among the U.S. imperialist invaders. U.S. officials in Thailand are actively engaged in suppressing the Thai people's patriotic struggle.

U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Unger traveled to the northern province of Lamphun in November to carry out his evil deeds of suppressing the Thai people. At the end of November, he went to the southern province of Songkhla, where he "inspected" the Ninth Region "border police" and directed them to suppress the people of southern Thailand.

The U.S. Information Agency's mobile unit in Phetchabun Province sent personnel to Pichit Province on November 20 to direct the suppression of the people. At the same time, some U.S. personnel boarded helicopters to Phetchabun Province's Nakhon Thai County to suppress the Thai people. U.S. invading forces in Thailand are increasingly directly involved in the evil activities of suppressing the Thai people.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station pointed out that the U.S. imperialist bandits are so rampant in suppressing the Thai people, which makes the Thai people's anger burn even more fiercely. The Thai people will surely settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists for their blood debts.

According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on December 14, the brave armed forces of Nakhon Thai County, Phetchabun Province, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, shot down a U.S.-Thanom reactionary helicopter on December 4.

The radio station also said that since December, the armed forces in Lamphun and Pichit Provinces have shot down and damaged five U.S.-Thanom reactionary helicopters.

The radio station pointed out that the victories achieved by the Thai people's armed forces once again exposed the paper tiger nature of the U.S.-Thanom clique.

According to news from Bangkok, workers in various parts of Thailand have been continuously striking, protesting against the brutal oppression and exploitation of the Thanom-Praphat reactionary clique, demanding improved living conditions and working conditions, and defending their legitimate rights.

According to reports in Thai newspapers, all small taxi drivers in a district of Chaiyaphum Province in central Thailand went on strike on November 15 to protest against the reactionary police's frequent extortion, which left their lives without security.

Public bus workers in Nakhon Pathom Province went on strike on November 28 to protest against the Thanom-Praphat reactionary clique's bus company's unreasonable withholding of wages and arbitrary dismissal of workers, demanding improved working conditions. According to the strikers' representatives, due to the Thanom-Praphat reactionary clique's focus on profits without maintaining the buses, traffic accidents frequently occurred. The management shifted the responsibility to the workers, and recently two workers were unjustly dismissed. Under the workers' persistent struggle, the Thanom-Praphat reactionary clique was forced to accept the workers' legitimate demands.

More than 300 workers at a Thai ice cream factory went on strike on December 9 to protest against the management's unjust dismissal of workers.

According to a recent broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, in the first nine months of this year, 8,000 workers in various parts of Thailand participated in strike struggles.

    这家电台十三日广播，泰国人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺，使美帝国主义侵略者越来越恐慌。在泰国的美帝官员四出活动，加紧镇压泰国人民爱国斗争。
    美国驻泰大使昂格尔十一月到泰国北部黎府进行镇压泰国人民的罪恶勾当。十一月底，他又到泰国南部宋卡府活动，并“视察”了第九区“边防警察”，指挥他们镇压泰国南部人民。
    美国新闻处设在彭世洛府的流动组，在十一月二十日派人到碧差汶府指挥镇压人民的行动。同时，一些美国人员乘直升飞机到彭世洛府那空泰县镇压泰国人民。在泰国的美国侵略军也越来越多地直接参与镇压泰国人民的罪恶活动。
      “泰国人民之声”电台指出，美帝国主义强盗这样猖狂地镇压泰国人民，这使泰国人民胸中的怒火烧得更旺。泰国人民一定要向美帝国主义彻底清算血债。
    新华社十四日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台十四日广播，泰国共产党领导下的英勇的彭世洛府那空泰县人民武装，十二月四日击落美国—他侬反动集团的直升飞机一架。

    暖武里府公共汽车工人十一月二十八日举行罢工，抗议他侬—巴博反动集团经营的汽车公司无理扣压工资和肆意开除工人，要求改善工作条件。据罢工工人代表揭露，由于他侬—巴博反动集团只顾盈利而不对汽车进行维修，交通事故不断发生。资方却将责任转嫁给工人，最近有两名工人因此而遭到无理开除。在工人坚持斗争下，他侬—巴博反动集团被迫接受了工人的正当要求。
    泰国一家冷饮工厂的三百多名工人十二月九日举行罢工，反对资方无理开除工人。
    另据“泰国人民之声”电台最近广播，今年头九个月，泰国各地有八千名工人参加了罢工斗争。
