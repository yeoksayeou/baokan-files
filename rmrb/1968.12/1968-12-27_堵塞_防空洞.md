After the great wave of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has taken deep root in every household in Liqiao Village. Relationships between fathers and sons, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters have become comradely revolutionary bonds. No matter who it is, as soon as the "selfish" character shows, the whole family will rise up to criticize it.

Old poor peasant Chen Jingchun was cutting Suzi (a type of traditional Chinese medicine) at the foot of the mountain, planning to sell it himself. His daughter Chen Lixin immediately criticized him: "Cutting it for oneself is selfish."

Jingchun returned home after finishing his work and was about to eat. Lixin and her mother both said, "We haven't criticized your 'selfish' character today yet!" Thus, the dining table became a battlefield for criticizing selfishness and revisionism. Lixin and her mother took turns criticizing Jingchun's "selfish" character. Jingchun immediately recited Chairman Mao's teaching: "Because we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings." He humbly examined his "selfish" character.

Chen Jingchun and his wife Duan Youlan have only one daughter, Lixin. They have always loved her dearly since she was young. Lixin also deeply understands the hardships her parents endured in the old society and takes good care of them. However, when it comes to the struggle between public and private interests, they show no mercy to each other. They say: "Allowing 'selfish' character to have an 'air-raid shelter' in the family is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao."

Recently, during a family study session, they discussed how to raise the pigs in the brigade well. Lixin immediately pointed out to her mother, "When you feed your own pig, you always set aside two spoonfuls of cooked porridge to mix with the pig feed. Now that there is leftover food, you don't feed the brigade's pigs. What kind of thinking is this?" Because of this, the family study session discussed the issue several times until the "selfish" character was eliminated.

The daughter treats her parents like this, and the parents criticize their daughter's mistakes with equal fervor. During the great revolutionary criticism, Lixin was a bit shy in front of many people and did not speak up actively. Recently, during a family study session, Jingchun criticized Lixin, saying: "At this critical moment of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, you are not active. This is not a small problem." Youlan also seriously criticized Lixin. With the help of her parents, Lixin made a soul-searching examination.

    堵塞“防空洞”
    经过无产阶级文化大革命浪潮的冲洗，毛泽东思想在李崮寨的每个家庭里深深扎了根。父子、婆媳、夫妻、兄弟姊妹之间，已经成了同志式的革命关系。不管是什么人，只要“私”字一露头，全家人就群起而攻之。
    老贫农陈景春在山脚下割苏子（中药材），打算自己卖。女儿陈立新马上提出批评：“割了得交集体，归自己就是为私”。
    景春割完回家刚要吃饭，立新和她娘就一齐说：“你今天的‘私’字咱还没斗呢！”于是，吃饭桌变成了斗私批修的战场。立新和娘，你一言，我一语，齐向景春的“私”字开火。景春当即背诵了毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”他虚心地检查了自己的“私”字。
    陈景春和老伴段有兰只有立新一个女儿，从小对她很喜爱。立新也深知父母在旧社会受的苦楚，对老人生活也很照顾。可是一遇到公与私的斗争，谁对谁也毫不留情。他们说：“在家庭中让‘私’字有‘防空洞’，这是对毛主席他老人家的最大不忠。”
    最近他们在家庭学习班里讨论怎样把队里的猪喂好，立新开口就给娘指出：“你喂自己的猪时，做熟了稀饭都是先留出两勺子拌猪食，现在剩了饭却不喂队里的猪，这是什么思想？”就为这事，家庭学习班里一连讨论了几次，一直到破了“私”字为止。
    女儿对爹娘是这样，爹娘批评女儿的缺点错误同样是寸步不让。在革命大批判中，立新由于在人多的场合有点害羞，发言不积极。最近，在家庭学习班上，景春批评立新说：
  “在捍卫毛主席的革命路线的时刻，你不积极，这不是个小问题。”有兰也对立新严肃地进行了批评。在父母亲的帮助下，立新作了触及灵魂的检查。　  大众日报记者
