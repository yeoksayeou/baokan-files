The joyous news of China's successful test of another hydrogen bomb reached our Dazhai Brigade, and the mountains of Hu Tou reverberated with excitement. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, filled with boundless excitement, enthusiastically celebrated the success of this new hydrogen bomb test, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" over and over again.

The success of this new hydrogen bomb test marks another leap forward in the development of China's nuclear weapons. This is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another bountiful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a significant contribution to the upcoming Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. We, the entire poor and lower-middle peasantry of the Dazhai Brigade, extend our warm congratulations to the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, scientists, and all relevant personnel involved in the research and testing of nuclear weapons, and we salute them!

The success of China's new hydrogen bomb test is a great victory for the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and scientific and technical personnel engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons, who have applied Chairman Mao's great teachings in practice. Our great leader Chairman Mao said:

"We must not follow the old path of technological development taken by other countries, crawling step by step behind others. We must break the rules and adopt advanced technology as much as possible, and in a not too long historical period, build our country into a socialist, modernized, powerful nation." Chairman Mao's teachings have been grasped by the broad revolutionary masses and have become an inexhaustible force, becoming a powerful spiritual atom bomb. With this spiritual atom bomb, we can not only successfully test material atom bombs and hydrogen bombs, but also create any material miracles. The success of this new hydrogen bomb test will certainly make the invincible Mao Zedong Thought even more deeply ingrained in people's hearts, and thus achieve even more glorious and great victories on all fronts!

The success of China's new hydrogen bomb test is another blow to the nuclear threats and blackmail policies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. It is a great encouragement and support for the heroic Vietnamese people to carry the anti-U.S. national salvation war to the end, and it is also a great encouragement and support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world. The explosion of China's hydrogen bomb has frightened the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, greatly boosting the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary people of the whole world. It is a powerful criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by the great traitor, great internal spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents.

The success of this new hydrogen bomb test is a great joyous event, bringing great encouragement to the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Dazhai Brigade. We, the people of Dazhai, will definitely, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promote proletarian politics, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, grasp revolution, vigorously promote production, strive to complete the glorious tasks of class struggle, criticism, and transformation in the countryside, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and present a gift to the upcoming Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In the coming year of 1969, we will achieve new victories.

    无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队全体贫下中农
    我国又爆炸了一颗氢弹的特大喜讯传到我们大寨大队以后，虎头山下一片欢腾。广大贫下中农怀着无比激动的心情，热烈欢呼这次新的氢弹试验的成功，千遍万遍高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    这次新的氢弹试验的成功，表明我国核武器的发展又有了新的飞跃。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果，是对将要召开的党的第九次全国代表大会的一项重大献礼。我们大寨大队全体贫下中农，向从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军指战员、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员，表示热烈的祝贺，并向他们致敬！
    我国这次新的氢弹试验的成功，是从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军指战员和科学技术人员活学活用毛主席伟大指示的伟大胜利。伟大领袖毛主席说：
  “我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。”毛主席的这一教导被广大革命群众所掌握，变成了无穷无尽的力量，变成了威力无比的精神原子弹。有了这一精神原子弹，我们不仅可以试验成功物质的原子弹和氢弹，而且能够创造出任何物质上的奇迹。这次新的氢弹试验成功，必将使战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加深入人心，从而在各条战线上夺取更加辉煌、更加伟大的胜利！
    我国这次新的氢弹试验成功，又一次打击了美帝、苏修的核威胁、核讹诈政策，对于英勇的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底是一个大的鼓舞和支持，对于世界各国人民的革命斗争，也是一个大的鼓舞和支持。我国氢弹的爆炸，吓破了美帝、苏修和各国反动派的胆，大长了全世界革命人民的革命志气，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线是一次有力的批判。
    这次新的氢弹试验成功，是一件大喜事，给我们大寨大队的贫下中农带来了巨大的鼓舞。我们大寨人一定要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到新的水平，进一步促进人的思想革命化，狠抓革命，猛促生产，努力完成农村各项斗、批、改的光荣任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，向将要召开的党的第九次全国代表大会献礼，在即将来临的一九六九年里立新功。
