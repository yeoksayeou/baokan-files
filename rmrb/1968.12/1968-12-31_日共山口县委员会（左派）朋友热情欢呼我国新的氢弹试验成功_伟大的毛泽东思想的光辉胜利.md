	Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Tokyo, Japan - On the 29th, Kuroya Shoichiro, a standing committee member of the Leftist Faction of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement warmly celebrating the success of our country's new hydrogen bomb test as a great victory of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought.

	Kuroya said that in the storm of the anti-American patriotic struggle, the revolutionary people of Japan listened with great excitement to the news of China's successful new hydrogen bomb test.

	Kuroya pointed out that this is a new great achievement of the Chinese people in their struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a new contribution to the people of the world who are fighting against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. It is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Kuroya said that the Leftist Faction of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the revolutionary people of Yamaguchi Prefecture extend their warmest congratulations to the Chinese people. They pay their highest respects to the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao.

	Kuroya emphasized that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, are developing nuclear weapons at an unparalleled speed in the world. This shows the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, who are conducting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution based on proletarian internationalism. It is a powerful response to the nuclear blackmail policy pursued by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

	Kuroya said that the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test has made the U.S.-Japan reactionaries tremble, while it is a great encouragement and support for the Japanese people who are fighting against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

	Kuroya strongly condemned the American imperialists and Soviet social imperialists for their long-standing nuclear blackmail policy, attempting to enslave the people of the world with it.

	Kuroya said that China's new victory in the development of nuclear weapons has shattered the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail policy of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, dealing a heavy blow to their conspiracy to redivide the world.

	Kuroya pointed out that socialist China conducts necessary and limited nuclear tests and develops nuclear weapons to break the nuclear monopoly and prevent imperialists and revisionists from waging nuclear wars. The ultimate goal is to eliminate nuclear weapons.

	Kuroya concluded with a call:
	“Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution of China!”
	“Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!”

    日共山口县委员会（左派）朋友热情欢呼我国新的氢弹试验成功
    伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利
    中国人民的这一伟大成果，是对正在同帝修反作斗争的世界人民的新贡献
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）常任委员古谷庄一郎二十九日发表谈话，热情欢呼我国新的氢弹试验成功是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    古谷说，在反美爱国斗争风暴中，日本革命人民以非常激动的心情听到中国这次新的氢弹试验成功的消息。
    古谷指出，这是中国人民在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中取得的新的伟大成果，是对正在同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争的全世界人民做出的新贡献，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一新的伟大胜利。
    古谷说，日共山口县委员会（左派）和山口县革命人民向中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺，向中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友林彪同志致以最崇高的敬意。
    古谷强调指出，中国人民以世界上无以伦比的速度发展核武器，表现出在毛泽东同志领导下进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民的那种基于无产阶级国际主义的革命气概，它是中国人民对美苏勾结推行核讹诈政策的一个有力回答。
    古谷说，中国这次新的氢弹试验的成功，使美日反动派吓得发抖，而对于正在同美日反动派进行斗争的日本人民，是巨大的鼓舞和支持。
    古谷强烈谴责美帝国主义者和苏联社会帝国主义者多年来一直推行核讹诈政策，妄图以此奴役世界人民。
    古谷说，中国在发展核武器方面取得的新胜利，粉碎了美帝、苏修的核垄断和核讹诈政策，给美帝、苏修妄图重新瓜分世界的阴谋以沉重的打击。
    古谷指出，社会主义中国进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，是为了打破核垄断，阻止帝国主义者和修正主义者进行核战争，其最终目的是为了消灭核武器。
    古谷最后欢呼：
    “伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    “战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”
