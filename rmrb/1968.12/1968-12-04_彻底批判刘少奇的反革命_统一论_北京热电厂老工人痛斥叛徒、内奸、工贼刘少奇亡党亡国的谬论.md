While studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the lessons of history and reviewing the report from the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, old workers from Beijing Thermal Power Plant expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the great traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. They concentrated their criticism on Liu Shaoqi's capitulationist "unity theory" during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Every word they spoke was a cannon shot aimed at Liu Shaoqi, each sentence burning with the fire of denunciation. Chen Chenggong, a worker from the logistics team and a new party member, angrily said: "Liu Shaoqi's 'unity theory' is nothing but a capitulationist theory."

I am the son of a poor peasant. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, how could we have today's life? Yet, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi, wearing the cloak of a Communist Party member, did the work of the Kuomintang, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao proposed the anti-Japanese national united front, which "should be united in the war of resistance, united in solidarity, united in progress," "only progress can bring unity, only unity can bring resistance, only progress, unity, and resistance can bring unity." But Liu Shaoqi did not talk about resistance and progress; he merely said that the Kuomintang is "the most common, legal form of the anti-Japanese united front, the best ready-made form." His so-called "unity" was nothing but to let the Kuomintang "unify" the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the liberated areas, to let the Kuomintang "rule the country," to implement fascist dictatorship. He is truly despicable! Liu Shaoqi's "unity theory" is a genuine capitulationist theory.

The united front is one of the three magic weapons of our party to defeat the enemy and an important part of the strategic thought of our great leader Mao Zedong. However, if we follow Liu Shaoqi's so-called "unity," it will only lead to the destruction of the party, the country, and the people. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is to resist Japan, to make a revolution, and to establish a new China with the dictatorship of the proletariat. Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary line is to capitulate, to sell out the country, and to promote capitalism. From this, it is not difficult to see that Liu Shaoqi and Chiang Kai-shek are singing the same tune and walking the same path. Their goal is to destroy the Communist Party and seize the political power of the proletariat. This is sheer delusion! Dong Baoling, a mason, said angrily:

"Liu Shaoqi is waving a counterrevolutionary black flag."

The great leader Mao Zedong teaches us: "Without the political leadership of the proletariat and its party, the anti-Japanese national united front cannot be established, the goal of peaceful democratic resistance cannot be achieved, the motherland cannot be defended, and a unified democratic republic cannot be successful." Yet, Liu Shaoqi called the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people, the "banner" of the revolution, praising "Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of the war of resistance and nation-building." This is sheer servility! What is Chiang Kai-shek? He is the representative of the big landlords and big capitalists, the sworn enemy of the Chinese people. It was this Chiang Kai-shek who massacred countless Communist Party members and revolutionary masses during the ten years of civil war; it was this Chiang Kai-shek who sold all the rights of China to imperialism; it was this Chiang Kai-shek who wanted to destroy the Communist Party and rule over the Chinese people forever. It is clear that Liu Shaoqi is a loyal dog of Chiang Kai-shek.

I am a demobilized soldier who worked in a factory before joining the army. My whole family knows best what to love and what to hate. We will never forget the well-diggers, and we will never forget Chairman Mao for giving us our freedom. In our hands, there is only one flag, the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. It was this glorious flag that guided us to establish a broad anti-Japanese national united front during the great War of Resistance Against Japan, defeating Japanese imperialism. Later, it also defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries and liberated the whole of China. Holding high this great red flag, we workers have a direction for our revolution and an endless source of strength to fight the enemy!

Why did the great traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi praise Chiang Kai-shek as the "banner"? It is because he, together with Wang Ming, opposed the principle of independence and self-reliance proposed by Chairman Mao in the anti-Japanese national united front, opposed the leadership of the proletariat, and attempted to help the Kuomintang reactionaries extinguish the Communist Party and the liberated areas.

The judgment of history is ruthless. Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary black flag has long been burned to ashes by the revolutionary fire. We, the working class, must settle accounts for all of Liu Shaoqi's crimes! Old worker and Communist Party member Tian Changjiang, with deep hatred and anger, said:

"Liu Shaoqi's 'flexibility' is to meet the needs of the counterrevolution."

The re-publication of Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is excellent and represents the wishes of our working class!

In this report, the great leader Chairman Mao deeply points out: "Our principles must be firm, and we must also have all the necessary and permissible flexibility to achieve these principles." We believe that revolutionary flexibility must serve revolutionary principles. If the revolutionary content is removed from flexibility, it becomes opportunism.

The great traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi avoids talking about revolutionary principles but talks a lot about "flexibility" and "practicality." He shamelessly beautifies his evil deeds of betraying the party, the people, the nation, the revolution, and the leadership of the proletariat as "strategic needs." We want to ask, whose class needs are these? In short, Liu Shaoqi's so-called "flexibility" and "practicality" are to meet his counterrevolutionary needs, to adapt to the needs of the Kuomintang reactionaries and Chiang Kai-shek.

Under the guise of "flexibility," the great traitor Liu Shaoqi has repeatedly knelt under the enemy's butcher's knife. In 1936, he instructed several traitors to surrender and defect to the enemy and published anti-communist announcements in the press.

Under the guise of "flexibility," this great spy attempted to sell the people's political power and the people's army.

Under the guise of "flexibility," this great scab said that "exploitation is meritorious" and "welcomed" the capitalist class to exploit workers.

What a black-hearted, black-lunged fellow! He is doing counterrevolutionary deeds under the guise of "flexibility." His so-called "flexibility" is his counterrevolutionary nature. Zhang Shichang, a worker from the heat engineering class, said angrily:

"Liu Shaoqi is the spokesman for the Kuomintang."

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "In the period of the anti-Japanese united front, struggle is the means of unity, and unity is the goal of struggle. Struggle for unity will preserve unity, and compromise for unity will destroy unity." Chairman Mao wants us to both unite and struggle in the anti-Japanese national united front. However, Wang Ming and Liu Shaoqi, this pair of opportunistic twins, vigorously advocated for unity without struggle. In essence, they only allowed Chiang Kai-shek to sell out the country and rule by force, not allowing the Eighth Route Army to resist and save the country. This is counterrevolutionary logic!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To mobilize all forces to strive for victory in the war of resistance," while Liu Shaoqi wants to promote capitulationism under the guise of "unity," betraying the war of resistance and the Communist Party. The question is whether to struggle or to capitulate, which is the focus of the struggle between the two lines.

In their attitude towards the Communist Party and revolutionary people, Chiang Kai-shek is a venomous snake, and Liu Shaoqi is a snake disguised as a beautiful woman; Chiang Kai-shek is a wolf with its fangs bared, and Liu Shaoqi is a wolf in sheep's clothing. They are of the same ilk! They are all enemies of the people!

Today, we, the working class, must pull out his fangs, peel off his disguise, and smash Liu Shaoqi's black bones along with his capitulationist theory! Su Shouxue, a worker from the operation team and a Communist Party member, said with burning anger:

"Liu Shaoqi's gourd is filled with treasonous medicine."

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the beacon guiding us from victory to victory, while Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line is the black line of party destruction and national ruin. The struggle between these two lines has never stopped. We must thoroughly discuss Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line.

Liu Shaoqi, this great villain, played every trick in the book of the counterrevolutionary two-faced during the War of Resistance Against Japan, attempting to make us surrender, disarm, and hand over power. This is the ironclad evidence of Liu Shaoqi, this old counterrevolutionary, betraying the revolution and the people! This is completely in line with Chiang Kai-shek's poisonous scheme of "limiting, dissolving, and opposing" the Communists! Liu Shaoqi's soft knife kills without blood, and his gourd is filled with treasonous medicine.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's weapons, every gun, every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." Chairman Mao also said: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." Liu Shaoqi wants us to hand over party power, military power, and political power to Chiang Kai-shek, which is to hand over the lifeline of the working class and the broad masses of laborers to Chiang Kai-shek. This is absolutely not possible! The past was bitter because we had no "power"; the present is sweet because we have "power." With political power, we have everything; without political power, we lose everything. Therefore, we must never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. The political power of the proletariat, we workers and the broad masses of laborers, must firmly grasp it!

The editorial of the "Two Lines, One Magazine" titled "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" has brought us the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao: "The lessons of history are worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly discussed and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." The old workers participating in the discussion unanimously expressed: We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and constantly and repeatedly discuss the struggle between the two lines within the party. Every time we discuss the struggle between the two lines within the party, we increase our class feelings for Chairman Mao; every time we criticize Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary line, we increase our revolutionary vigor. We must forever supply heat and electricity for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must be good red propagandists of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the high tide of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines.

    彻底批判刘少奇的反革命“统一论”
    ——北京热电厂老工人痛斥叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇亡党亡国的谬论
    在学习毛主席关于历史的经验值得注意的最新指示和重温《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》的时候，北京热电厂的老工人怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，集中批判了刘少奇在抗日战争时期鼓吹的投降主义的“统一论”。他们的每一句话都是射向刘少奇的一颗炮弹，字字句句都燃烧着声讨刘少奇的怒火。后勤连工人、新党员陈成功愤怒地说：“刘少奇的‘统一论’就是投降论”
    我是贫农的儿子，要不是毛主席的革命路线，咱们那能有今天？可是，大叛徒刘少奇披着共产党员的外衣，却干着国民党的事，和蒋介石穿着一条裤子，反对毛主席的革命路线。毛主席提出的抗日民族统一战线，“应该统一于抗战，统一于团结，统一于进步”，“只有进步才能团结，只有团结才能抗日，只有进步团结抗日才能统一。”而刘少奇却不谈抗战和进步，胡说什么国民党是“抗日统一战线最通俗的、合法的组织形式，最好的现成的形式。”他嘴里高喊的“统一”，无非就是让国民党把共产党、八路军、解放区“统一”起来，让国民党“一统天下”，实行法西斯专政，真是混蛋透顶！刘少奇鼓吹的“统一论”，是货真价实的投降论。
    统一战线，是我们党战胜敌人的三大法宝之一，是我们伟大领袖毛主席战略思想的一个重要组成部分。
    但是，如果按照刘少奇的所谓“统一”去办，那只会亡党、亡国、亡头。毛主席的革命路线，是要抗日、要革命、要建立无产阶级专政的新中国。刘少奇的反革命路线，是要投降、要卖国、要搞资本主义。由此不难看出刘少奇和蒋介石唱的是一个调子，走的是一条路，他们的目的就是要消灭共产党，专咱们无产阶级的政。这真是妄想！瓦工董保岭同志越批越气愤地说：
  “刘少奇打的是一面反革命黑旗”
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“离开了无产阶级及其政党的政治领导，抗日民族统一战线就不能建立，和平民主抗战的目的就不能实现，祖国就不能保卫，统一的民主共和国就不能成功。”可是，刘少奇却说双手沾满人民鲜血的卖国贼蒋介石是革命的“旗帜”，吹捧“蒋介石是抗战建国的领导者”，这完全是一派奴才相！蒋介石是什么东西？他是大地主、大资本家的总代表，是中国人民不共戴天的死敌。就是这个蒋介石，在十年内战中屠杀了千千万万的共产党员和革命群众；就是这个蒋介石，出卖中国的一切权利给帝国主义；就是这个蒋介石，要消灭共产党，永远骑在中国人民的头上。可见，刘少奇是蒋介石的忠实走狗。
    我是个转业军人，参军前就在工厂里做工，我和我的全家都最知道爱什么，恨什么。吃水不忘挖井人，翻身不忘毛主席。我们手中只有一杆旗，就是毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。就是这面光辉的旗帜，在伟大的抗日战争中，引导我们建立了广泛的抗日民族统一战线，战胜了日本帝国主义。以后，又打败了国民党反动派，解放了全中国。高举这面伟大红旗，我们工人阶级干革命就有方向，打敌人就有无穷的力量！
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇为什么把蒋介石吹捧为“旗帜”呢？就是因为他和王明一起，反对毛主席提出的抗日民族统一战线中独立自主的原则，反对无产阶级的领导权，妄图帮助蒋介石反动派扑灭共产党和解放区。
    历史的判决是无情的，刘少奇的反革命黑旗，早就被革命的烈火烧成了灰。我们工人阶级一定要清算刘少奇的全部罪行！老工人、共产党员田长江怀着对刘少奇的深仇大恨愤
    怒地说：
    “刘少奇的‘灵活性’是适应
        反革命的需要”
    伟大领袖毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》的重新发表，好极了，代表了俺们工人阶级的心愿！
    伟大的领袖毛主席在这个报告中深刻地指出：“我们的原则性必须是坚定的，我们也要有为了实现原则性的一切许可的和必需的灵活性。”我们认为革命的灵活性必须服从于革命的原则性，如果抽掉了灵活性的革命内容，那就是机会主义。
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇避口不谈革命的原则性，却大谈什么“灵活性”和“实际性”。还恬不知耻地把他出卖党、出卖人民、出卖民族、出卖革命、出卖无产阶级的领导权的罪恶勾当，美化为“出于当时的策略需要”。我们要问这是出于那个阶级的需要？说穿了，刘少奇所谓的“灵活性”、“实际性”，就是出于他反革命的需要，就是适应国民党反动派、蒋介石的需要。
    在“灵活性”的幌子下，大叛徒刘少奇多次跪倒在敌人的屠刀下。一九三六年，他又指使几个叛徒，向敌人自首变节，在报刊上发表反共启事。
    在“灵活性”的幌子下，这个大内奸妄图出卖人民的政权和人民的军队。
    在“灵活性”的幌子下，这个大工贼胡说什么“剥削有功”，“欢迎”资产阶级剥削工人。
    好一个黑心、黑肺的家伙！他就是在“灵活性”的幌子下干着反革命的勾当。他所谓的“灵活性”，就是他的反革命本性。热工班工人张士昌气愤地说：
    “刘少奇是国民党的代言人”
    毛主席早就指出：“在抗日统一战线时期中，斗争是团结的手段，团结是斗争的目的。以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡”。毛主席要我们在抗日民族统一战线中既要联合，又要斗争。可是，王明和刘少奇这一对机会主义的双胞胎，却竭力地鼓吹只要联合，不要斗争。说穿了，就是只许蒋介石卖国独裁，不许八路军抗日救国。这是反革命的逻辑！
    毛主席教导我们：“为动员一切力量争取抗战胜利而斗争”，而刘少奇要在“统一”的幌子下推行投降主义，出卖抗战，出卖共产党。是要斗争，还是要投降，这是两条路线斗争的焦点。
    在对待共产党和革命人民的态度上，蒋介石是露出毒牙的蛇，刘少奇是化作美女的蛇；蒋介石是凶象毕露的狼，刘少奇是披着羊皮的狼。他们是一路货色！都是人民的死敌！
    今天我们工人阶级就是要拔掉他的毒牙，扒开他的画皮，把刘少奇的黑骨子连同他的投降论一起砸烂！运行工人、共产党员苏守学满腔怒火地说：
    “刘少奇的葫芦里装的是卖国药”
    毛主席的革命路线是指引我们从胜利走向胜利的灯塔，而刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线是亡党亡国的黑线，这两条路线的斗争一天也没有停止过。我们就是要大讲特讲毛主席的革命路线，大批狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。
    刘少奇这个大坏蛋在抗日战争时期耍尽反革命两面派的手法，妄图要我们投降，要我们缴枪，要我们让权。这是刘少奇这个老反革命出卖革命、出卖人民的铁证！这完全是和蒋介石“限共、溶共、反共”的毒计一脉相承！刘少奇的软刀子杀人不见血，葫芦里装的是卖国药。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”毛主席还说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”刘少奇想让我们把党权、军权、政权统统交给蒋介石，就是要把我们工人阶级和广大劳动人民的命根子交给蒋介石，这一千个办不到、一万个办不到！过去苦，就苦在没有“权”；现在甜，就甜在有了“权”。有了政权就有一切，丧失政权就丧失一切。因此，我们要念念不忘无产阶级专政。无产阶级的政权，我们工人阶级和广大劳动人民掌定了！
    两报一刊社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”参加座谈的老工人一致表示：要按照毛主席这个教导，党内两条路线的斗争，一定要经常讲，反复讲。讲一次党内两条路线的斗争，就增加一分对毛主席的阶级感情；批一次刘少奇的反革命路线，就增加一分革命的干劲。我们要永远为毛主席的革命路线供好热、发好电。我们要在学习两条路线斗争史的高潮中，当好毛主席革命路线红色的宣传员。
