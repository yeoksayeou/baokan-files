On November 27 and 28, we held meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants, village-level cadres, and commune medical staff in Huangcun People's Commune, Daxing County, and Liangxiang People's Commune, Fangshan County, respectively. We listened to their opinions on the cooperative medical system implemented by Leyuan People's Commune in Longyang County, Hubei Province. Participants unanimously agreed that cooperative medicine is the direction for rural medical work and a good method. The following is a summary of their opinions and questions raised:

1. Views of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants:

Poor and lower-middle peasants fully support the cooperative medical system. They said, "This is Chairman Mao caring for us poor and lower-middle peasants!" "In the countryside, apart from the grain issue, seeing a doctor is a big deal." They also said, "This method is excellent!" "This is the best method!" "This is the best way to do it, and we wholeheartedly welcome and firmly support it." They also said, "If it is truly implemented, we should hold a meeting to celebrate and thank Chairman Mao."

Poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The cooperative medical system is beneficial to us." "Medical care is guaranteed, and we no longer have to worry about not having money to see a doctor. In the countryside, money is sometimes available, sometimes not. After settling accounts, there are many places to spend money, who can save money for treatment?" "Adults can endure illness; children's illnesses are truly worrisome, but with the cooperative medical system, we are at ease."

They talked about the significance of the cooperative medical system, saying, "We poor and lower-middle peasants are one family; this is a matter of mutual help in times of difficulty." Some said, "My family of ten people, not to mention contributing ten yuan a year, even twenty yuan is fine. With illness, there is no need to worry!" However, they expressed that even if the cooperative medical system is implemented, "minor illnesses will still not be seen by a doctor, so that everyone's money can be used for treating major illnesses. For a cold or flu, not taking medicine, drinking a bowl of ginger tea to sweat it out is also effective."

Poor and lower-middle peasants with many family members, frequent illnesses, and relatively poor economic conditions are particularly enthusiastic about the cooperative medical system. Even those with fewer family members, infrequent illnesses, and better economic conditions also expressed agreement. They said, "I rarely get sick all year round, but I still agree. This is beneficial to class brothers with many family members and few laborers." "Although I rarely get sick, we all eat five grains, how can we not get a headache or fever?"

Poor and lower-middle peasants welcome the commune medical staff being sent down to the production brigades to earn work points. They said that the commune medical staff rarely come to the village, and even when asked to visit, they sometimes do not come. Sitting in the health center, wearing a large mask, even a double-layered one. Poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Let them come down, they can help them put down their intellectual's arrogance and get rid of their stench." "Like the teachers in public primary schools, medical staff should also be managed by us poor and lower-middle peasants to serve us better." "Medical staff coming down makes it more convenient for us poor and lower-middle peasants to see a doctor." Sending down medical staff will increase the burden on the production brigade somewhat, but the brigade cadres said: We welcome it, this is an unthinkable good thing. Community members said: If it were not for Chairman Mao's directive, many intellectuals would not be willing to be sent down; as long as there are those who come down, we all welcome them. They also said: Now grain is increasing year by year, arranging a few people is not a problem. Some brigades with less land and more people, and tighter grain rations, are only willing to accept one doctor to settle down.

Poor and lower-middle peasants also proposed some positive opinions on how to implement the cooperative medical system:

(1) Ideological work must keep up, with proletarian politics in command. Both the significant improvement in the ideological awareness of the broad masses of community members over the past two years through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and timely ideological and political work must be fully recognized;

(2) Preventive work must be strengthened. In the past, doctors only treated diseases but did not care about the sources of diseases. Rural water sources, mosquitoes, flies, environmental sanitation, and other problems must be solved. Guo Zhongli, a poor and lower-middle peasant from Huangcun Commune, said that if preventive measures are not taken, once an epidemic occurs, even if the cooperative medical fund is increased tenfold, it will not be enough to cover the expenses;

(3) Medical work must be improved. Poor and lower-middle peasants proposed that medication should be limited to one day's supply, at most not exceeding two days, to avoid drug waste. Issuing sick leaves must be strictly controlled to ensure the combination of revolution and production.

2. Views of Cadres:

Cadres also believe this is a good method, but they consider more issues than the poor and lower-middle peasants. For example, a deputy director of the Huangcun People's Commune Revolutionary Committee said: To implement this method, ideological education work must be strengthened. Because the commune is far from each production brigade, the situation of the community members is not understood, and it is not convenient to directly do ideological work for the community members. I think it is better to concentrate the cooperative medical funds and let the brigade manage them. They can combine the use of these funds with ideological work. Additionally, some patients spend too much money, which also affects the consolidation of the cooperative medical system. For such patients, a method can be adopted where part of the expenses are paid from the cooperative medical fund, and part is borne by the patient themselves. In this way, both collective mutual aid and encouraging patients to save money and live frugally can be achieved.

He also said that if there are brigades with many family members, few laborers, and many households owing money to the brigade after the year-end settlement, what should be done? Whether to implement it in such brigades should be discussed collectively and decided based on the situation.

The view of the director of the Dongyang Brigade Revolutionary Committee of Liangxiang People's Commune is the opposite. He said, "Our brigade has many households with many family members and few laborers, but cooperative medicine can still be implemented. If community members temporarily do not have money, the brigade can advance it; otherwise, if you do not advance it for them, do not let them participate in cooperative medicine, they will still borrow money from the brigade to see a doctor, which is the same inside and out."

3. Views of Medical Staff:

Many commune medical staff agree with this method. They said: In this way, when encountering patients without money, the hospital does not have to worry about funding issues. They are more concerned about the destination of most medical staff after implementing this method, especially the issue of their families, and hope for a solution.

4. Several questions raised during the meeting:

(1) What if the cooperative medical fund is not enough?

(2) How to pay for long-term medication?

(3) How to arrange the medical staff of the commune health station? Are the ten people who earn work points all sent down to the brigades? Should the two people who temporarily receive wages stay in the health station? If so, can the two people handle the outpatient clinic? How to handle the original medical tasks for the non-agricultural population?

(4) Can the children of the four types of elements participate in cooperative medicine?

    黄村、良乡公社对乐园公社实行合作医疗制度的意见
    ——贫下中农、农村基层干部、公社医务人员座谈会纪要
    十一月二十七日和二十八日，我们到京郊大兴县黄村人民公社和房山县良乡人民公社分别召开了贫下中农、农村基层干部、公社医务人员座谈会，广泛地听取了他们对湖北省长阳县乐园人民公社实行的合作医疗制度的意见。参加座谈的人一致认为，合作医疗是农村医疗工作的方向，是一种好办法。现将他们的意见及提出的问题整理如下：
    一、贫下中农的看法：
    贫下中农完全赞成合作医疗制度。他们说：“这是毛主席关心我们贫下中农！”“在农村除了口粮问题外，看病是个大事。”他们还说：“这办法好极了！”“这是最好的办法！”“这么办最好了，我们从心眼里欢迎，坚决拥护。”又说：“真实行了，我们应该开个大会庆祝，感谢毛主席他老人家。”
    贫下中农说：“合作医疗制度对我们有好处。”“看病有了保障，也不用再为没钱看病着急了。农村的钱，有时有，有时没有。结算以后，用钱的地方多得很，谁家留些钱等着治病用？”“大人有病，抗抗就过去了；小孩有病，真急死大人，有了合作医疗制度我们就放心了。”
    他们谈到合作医疗制度的意义时说：“咱贫下中农是一家，这是一家有难大家帮的事。”有的说：“我一家十口，甭说一年拿十元，就是拿二十元，也干。有了病就不着急了！”但是，他们表示，即使实行了合作医疗制度，“小病还是不看医生，让大伙的钱用在治大病上。伤风感冒，不吃药，喝碗姜汤冒冒汗一样行。”
    人口多、经常有人生病、经济条件差一些的贫下中农对合作医疗制度非常欢迎。就是那些人口少、很少得病、经济条件较好的贫下中农同样表示赞成。他们说：“我一年到头不爱得个病，但我也同意。这对人口多、劳力少的阶级兄弟有好处。”“说是不爱得病，但都是吃五谷杂粮的，哪能不得个头痛脑热的？”
    贫下中农欢迎公社医务人员下放大队记工分。他们说，公社医务人员好歹不到村里来转转，请他们出诊，有时还不来。坐在卫生院里，戴个大口罩，还是双层的。贫下中农说：“让他们下来，可以帮他们把那个知识分子的架子撂一撂，把臭气消一消。”“象公办小学的教员那样，医务人员也得由咱贫下中农来管，才能为咱们服务好。”“医务人员下来，这对我们贫下中农看病更方便了。”下放医务人员会给生产大队增加一点负担，但是大队干部说：我们欢迎，这是想都想不来的好事。社员说：不是毛主席发指示，知识分子中许多人是不愿下放的；只要有下来的，我们都欢迎。还说：现在粮食年年增产，安排几个人不成问题。有些地少人多、口粮较紧的大队只愿意接受医生一人落户。
    贫下中农对如何实行合作医疗制度，还提出了一些积极的意见：（1）思想工作要跟上，无产阶级政治挂帅。既要充分看到两年来的文化大革命大大提高了广大社员的思想觉悟，也要及时地做思想政治工作；
  （2）预防工作要大力加强。过去医生只管治病，而对病源是不关心的。农村的水源、蚊蝇、环境卫生等问题都要解决。黄村公社贫下中农郭仲理说，如果不注意预防，一旦发生疫病，那么合作医疗基金即使增加十倍，也是不够开支的；（3）医疗工作要改进。贫下中农提出，给药以给一天的药为宜，最多不超过两天，免得造成药物浪费。开假条要严格控制，以保证抓革命促生产。
    二、干部的看法：
    干部也都认为这是一种好办法，但他们考虑的问题比贫下中农社员要多。如黄村人民公社革委会一位副主任同志说：实行这种办法必须加强思想教育工作。因为公社离各个生产大队较远，对社员的情况不了解，也不便于直接对社员做思想工作，我看不如把合作医疗的基金集中由大队掌管，他们可以把支配这些钱和做思想工作结合起来。此外，有的病人花钱太多，也影响合作医疗制度的巩固。对这种病人，可采取分别由合作医疗基金中开支一部分，由病人自己负担一部分的办法。这样，既体现了集体的互助，又可促使病人自己节约，勤俭持家。
    他还说，如果遇到有些队里，人口多、劳力少、年终结算后欠队上钱的户比较多究竟怎么办？这种队实行不实行，应经过集体讨论，看情况。
    良乡人民公社东羊大队革委会主任的看法与此相反。他说：“我们队这种人口多、劳力少的户较多，但仍可实行合作医疗。社员手上一时没有钱，队上可以代垫；不然，你不给他们垫上，不让他们参加合作医疗，他们看病还是要到队来借，里外是一个样。”
    三、医务人员的看法：
    不少公社医务人员表示赞同这个办法。他们说：这样一来，再遇到没有钱的病人，医院用不着担心经费问题了。他们比较关心的是实行这个办法后，大部分医务人员的去向问题，特别是家属的问题，希望有一个办法。
    四、在座谈中大家提出的几个问题：
      （1）合作医疗基金一旦不够用时怎么办？
      （2）常年吃药的怎么拿药钱？
      （3）公社卫生所的医务人员怎样安排？记工分的十个人是否都下放到大队？暂时拿工资的两人是否留在卫生所里？如果是这样，卫生所的门诊，两人是否能忙得过来？原来担负的非农业人口的医疗任务又如何处理？
    （4）四类分子的子女是否能参加合作医疗？
