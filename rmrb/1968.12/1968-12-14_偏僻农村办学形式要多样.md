To quickly popularize elementary education in rural areas, I suggest establishing various forms of schools in remote rural regions. First, mobile schools. In sparsely populated production brigades, students can be gathered in a few locations, and a teacher can go to these places at designated times to teach. Second, alternate-day schools. In extremely scattered mountainous areas, students can gather every other day or every third day to attend school for one day. Third, home tutoring. For children of poor and lower-middle-class peasants living in isolated households, teachers can go to their homes at designated times to teach. Other types of schools can also be established. All these schools should allow students to bring their younger siblings to school. Our Wangkuzi Commune is a region with relatively scattered residences. Not only is it difficult for students to attend school if a brigade establishes a school, but even if a production team establishes a primary school, students still find it inconvenient to attend. For example, in the Taoxiangling Production Team, there are only nine households, each living in nine different hamlets, with the closest ones still over a mile apart, and all are mountain paths. It is very inconvenient for children to walk. If mobile schools could be established, these difficulties could be resolved.

    偏僻农村办学形式要多样
    为了尽快地普及农村小学教育，我建议在偏僻的农村，举办多种形式的学校。一、巡回学校。就是在居住分散的大队里，把学生分别集中在几个地方，由一名教师在规定的时间里去上课。二、隔日制学校。在过于分散的山区，可以隔一日二日或三日集中在一个地方上一天学。三、送学上门。对一庄一户的贫下中农子女，可由教师在规定的时间里去给上课。还可办其他类型的学校。这些学校都应允许学生带弟弟妹妹上学。我们王坬子公社，是居住比较分散的地区。不要说大队办学校，学生上学有困难，就是一个生产队办一所小学，学生上学也很不方便。如桃?岭生产队，只有九户人家，分住在九个庄头，相距最近的也有一里多路，而且都是山路，小孩子走起来很不方便，如能举办巡回学校，就可以解决这些困难。
