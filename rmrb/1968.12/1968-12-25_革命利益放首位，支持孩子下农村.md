Title: Put Revolutionary Interests First, Support Children Going to the Countryside

At a time when the entire nation's military and civilians are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the editorial note in *People's Daily* conveyed our great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive: "It is necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and other people to send their children who have finished junior high, senior high, or college to the countryside. A mobilization must be launched. Rural comrades in various places should welcome them."

I have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and deeply realized that as a cadre, the question of whether to support one's children in going to the mountains and countryside, walking the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, or pulling them back by "raising children to support old age" and not letting them leave one's side, is a great struggle between "public" and "private." It is also a severe test of one's loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

My eldest daughter, Qingmei, graduated from junior high this year. The school mobilized her to go to the mountains and countryside, and she also decided to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. However, I always felt that if Qingmei were assigned to work in a local factory, it would not only increase the family's income but also help with household chores. Therefore, I was not very enthusiastic about supporting Qingmei in going to the mountains and countryside.

The other day, Qingmei told me that she had decided to go to the countryside. Both my wife and I had intense internal struggles, thinking one way and then another.

Should we support Qingmei in going to the countryside or not? That night, I took this question to heart and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work *Against Liberalism*. Chairman Mao said: "A Communist should be open-minded, honest, active, and put revolutionary interests first, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests." Chairman Mao's teachings made me see clearly that sending educated youth to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is a long-term strategy to prevent and combat revisionism, a major issue concerning the cultivation of successors, and a matter of revolutionary interests. If for the sake of personal interests, one keeps the children by one's side and obstructs them from walking the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao, isn't this pushing the children onto the counter-revolutionary revisionist path of Liu Shaoqi?

My thoughts became clear, but my wife was still not very willing to let Qingmei go. What should I do? Chairman Mao taught us: "Setting up study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." Based on my wife's state of mind, my daughter and I decided to hold a family Mao Zedong Thought study class to "launch a mobilization." In the study class, we first studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work *The Orientation of the Youth Movement*, and severely criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "reading books to become officials," etc. Then, my daughter led everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any mistakes that we cannot abandon?" At this point, my wife lowered her head, and her thoughts were somewhat stirred. To further awaken her class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, I recalled our family's bitter history of not having enough to eat and wear in the old society, and contrasted it with today's happy life. I said, we have everything today all thanks to our great leader Chairman Mao. To ensure that our country will never change color, Chairman Mao has called for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, tempering themselves into successors of the revolutionary cause. This is the greatest care and love for the youth!

My wife is also from a poor peasant family. After hearing these words, she excitedly said: "Previously, I couldn't understand it. I was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of merging public and private interests,' and was blinded by the 'private' character, not caring about national affairs. Now, I understand. Go, child, Mom will not pull you back anymore!"

Now, Qingmei has gone to the countryside. Before she left, my wife pinned a shining Mao Zedong badge on her chest and instructed her: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Do revolution in the countryside for a lifetime."

    革命利益放首位，支持孩子下农村
    山东酒精工厂干部　刘立新
    正当全国亿万军民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时候，《人民日报》编者按传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”我反复学习了毛主席这一最新指示，深刻认识到：作为一个干部，是支持子女上山下乡，走与工农兵相结合的道路；还是扯后腿“养儿防老”，不让儿女离开自己的身旁，是一场“公”和“私”的大搏斗，也是对自己是否忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个严峻考验。
    我的大女儿庆梅今年初中毕业了。学校动员她上山下乡，她也决心到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。可是我总觉得，庆梅如果分配在本地工厂工作，既可以增加家庭收入，又能帮助料理家务。因此，我对支持庆梅上山下乡不大积极。
    前几天，庆梅告诉我，她已决定去农村了。我和孩子的妈妈听了，思想斗争都很激烈，一会这样想，一会那样想。
    究竟要不要支持庆梅到农村去？晚上我带着这个问题，反复学了毛主席《反对自由主义》这篇光辉著作。毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。毛主席的教导，使我豁然开朗，认识到知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农再教育，是防修反修的百年大计、千年大计，是关系到培养什么样的接班人的大事，是革命的利益。如果为了个人的一点私利，就把孩子留在身边，阻碍她走毛主席指引的革命道路，这不是把孩子往刘少奇的反革命修正主义道上推吗？
    我的思想想通了，可是，她妈妈还是不大愿意让庆梅走。怎么办呢？毛主席教导我们说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”我和庆梅根据她妈妈的思想状况，决定办一个家庭毛泽东思想学习班，“来一个动员”。在学习班上，我们首先学习了毛主席《青年运动的方向》这篇光辉著作，狠批了叛徒刘少奇“读书做官”等反革命修正主义黑货。接着，我女儿又领着大家一起学习了毛主席的教导：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”这时，我爱人低下了头，思想有些触动了。为了进一步启发她的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，我又回忆了在旧社会全家吃不饱、穿不暖的苦难家史，对比了今天的幸福生活。我说，我们有今天的一切全是靠我们的伟大领袖毛主席。为了保证我们的国家永不变色，毛主席又号召知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，把自己锻炼成革命事业的接班人。这是对青年的最大关怀和爱护！
    我爱人也是贫农出身，听了这些话，她激动地说：“以前，我想不通，是中了刘少奇‘公私溶化论’的毒，让‘私’字迷住了心窍，不关心国家大事。现在，我明白了。孩子，你去吧，妈妈不再扯你的后腿了！”
    现在，庆梅已经去农村了。临去前，我爱人把一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章戴在她的胸前，并且嘱咐她：“要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在农村干一辈子革命。”
