On December 27, 1968, our country successfully conducted a new hydrogen bomb test. When I heard this victorious news, I was extremely excited and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!"

This successful hydrogen bomb test is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It signifies a new leap in the development of our country's nuclear weapons. We, the poor peasants and herdsmen of Xinjiang, as well as the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups, share the same joy with the people of the entire country. We enthusiastically celebrate the success of this hydrogen bomb test and extend our warm congratulations to the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, and scientific researchers who have been engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons! We learn from the working class and pay tribute to the working class!

At present, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, in order to save their dying fate, are colluding with each other and concocting the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons," attempting to maintain their already broken nuclear monopoly and threaten the revolutionary people of various countries. This is sheer fantasy and daydreaming. Their counter-revolutionary collusion can only educate the revolutionary people of the world from the opposite side. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have successfully conducted a new hydrogen bomb test, once again striking a blow against the nuclear threat and nuclear blackmail policies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. This is a great encouragement and support for the heroic Vietnamese people to carry the anti-U.S. national salvation war to the end and for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang is excellent at present. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we will raise the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines, severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in Northwest China and Xinjiang, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the "February Countercurrent" in Xinjiang, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We in Xinjiang are stationed at the forefront of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles. We must further strengthen military-civilian unity and ethnic unity, and heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold. If the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists dare to invade, we will make them come to no avail and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate them!

    对美帝苏修的沉重打击
    新疆维吾尔自治区革委会副主任、哈萨克族贫苦牧民　孜牙
    一九六八年十二月二十七日，我国成功地进行了一次新的氢弹试验。当我听到这个胜利的消息时，心情非常激动，一遍又一遍地高呼毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    这次氢弹试验成功，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果，它标志着我国核武器的发展又有了新的飞跃。我们新疆贫下中农、贫苦牧民以及各族革命群众，同全国人民一样，以十分喜悦的心情，热烈欢呼这次氢弹试验的成功，并向从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军指战员、工程技术人员和科学工作者，致以热烈的祝贺！向工人阶级学习，向工人阶级致敬！
    当前，美帝、苏修为了挽救他们垂死的命运，正在互相勾结，炮制了所谓“防止核扩散条约”，妄图维持它们已被打破的核垄断地位，威胁各国革命人民。他们这是痴心妄想，白日作梦。他们的反革命勾结，只能从反面教育世界革命人民。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，成功地进行了一次新的氢弹试验，又一次打击了美帝、苏修的核威胁、核讹诈政策，对于英勇的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，对于世界各国革命人民的斗争，是一个大的鼓舞和支持。
    毛主席教导我们：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”当前，新疆的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好。我们要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，更高地举起马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙在西北和新疆的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底肃清“二月逆流”在新疆的流毒，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们新疆地处反帝、反修前哨，我们一定进一步加强军民团结，加强民族团结，百倍提高革命警惕。如果美帝、苏修胆敢来犯，我们就叫他们有来无回，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭他们！
