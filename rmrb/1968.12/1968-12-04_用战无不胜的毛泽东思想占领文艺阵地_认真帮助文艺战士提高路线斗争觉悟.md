Workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in Beijing's cultural and art institutions and art schools have extensively and deeply propagated Mao Zedong Thought among revolutionary cultural workers and students, conducted education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and through words and deeds, brought ideology, politics, and style to the forefront. This has effectively promoted the struggle, criticism, and reform in the cultural field.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on December 2, following Chairman Mao's great directive that the working class must lead everything, workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in Beijing's cultural and art institutions and art schools have implemented proletarian political leadership over intellectuals using Mao Zedong Thought. They have earnestly helped revolutionary cultural workers and students to study, apply, and use Mao Zedong Thought, raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and promoted the ideological transformation of individuals. This has effectively promoted the struggle, criticism, and reform in the cultural field.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us:

"The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." Since the workers and soldiers' propaganda teams entered the cultural field more than two months ago, they have placed the task of helping revolutionary cultural workers and students to further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines at the forefront of all their work. They have formed more than a thousand small teams, deeply entering classrooms, dormitories, rehearsal halls, and practice rooms to extensively and deeply propagate Mao Zedong Thought among revolutionary cultural workers and students, and conducted education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The workers and soldiers' propaganda teams of the model troupes such as the Beijing Opera Troupe, the Central Orchestra, and the China Opera Troupe organized everyone to review the struggle practice of Jiang Qing leading the broad revolutionary cultural workers in the revolution of Peking Opera. Many propaganda teams invited old workers who had suffered greatly in the old society to share their bitter experiences, organized everyone to visit factories and rural areas, deeply entering the reality of class struggle, and invited workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to talk about the history of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in factories and rural areas. The propaganda teams also brought the good experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought from factories and military units to cultural institutions and art schools, and formed "red groups" with revolutionary students in art schools, using words and deeds to bring ideology, politics, and style.

Through a series of meticulous and painstaking work by the workers and soldiers' propaganda teams, revolutionary cultural workers and students have deeply understood from the historical facts of the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines over the past more than ten years of liberation the evil of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi, deeply understood the greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and greatly strengthened their profound proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the great Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Broad revolutionary cultural workers and students have extensively and deeply carried out a revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist-roaders' counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art and counter-revolutionary revisionist line in education. They adopted the method of listing the crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, discussing its harm, purging its poison, and digging out its roots, and in the revolutionary criticism, they studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, greatly enhancing their awareness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Some cultural workers, holding the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" personally given by Comrade Jiang Qing, said excitedly: "Comrade Jiang Qing led us in the cultural revolution, making us truly begin to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, we thought we had studied Mao Zedong Thought quite well, but today, compared with the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, we see how far behind we are. The difference is that we have not worked hard on the 'application' of Mao Zedong Thought." Many comrades recalled their unforgettable scenes of being personally received by Chairman Mao many times, contrasted with the bitter experiences of artists being oppressed and humiliated in the old society, and said with tears in their eyes: "Chairman Mao is our great savior, Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, purge all the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the cultural field; we must honestly accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, thoroughly change our old ideas, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life." Now, in these cultural institutions and art schools, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are blooming everywhere, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought lectures are held continuously, big-character posters criticizing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi are everywhere, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has developed to a new level.

In leading revolutionary cultural workers and students to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the workers and soldiers' propaganda teams have focused on the ideological transformation of individuals and earnestly helped them to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview. Some students in art schools originally thought that their family background was good, they had not taken the wrong side in the Cultural Revolution, and there was no problem with studying Chairman Mao's works. Later, with the help of the propaganda teams, they reviewed their process of entering school with red scarves, "not liking it in the first year, following it in the second year, and changing greatly in the third year," and deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of cultural workers, and in the past, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi tried to lead us onto the capitalist road by opposing the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers from studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must, under the leadership of the working class, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly break with old traditions and old ideas, and become a new generation of communists. Many cultural workers, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have a deeper understanding of the importance of political leadership and a deeper understanding of the harm of the "self." They said, "No matter how good the artistic skills are, if there is no proletarian political mind, if one does not know how to praise the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and does not know how to serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, such artistic skills are not only useless but also harmful." They expressed their determination to take the working class as an example, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly move their standpoint to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, walk the path of combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life. Currently, under the leadership of the workers and soldiers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the struggle, criticism, and reform in Beijing's various cultural institutions and art schools are being carried out in depth. Broad revolutionary cultural workers and students have launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and the work of cleaning up class ranks is continuously developing. The political atmosphere in various units has changed greatly, and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are being rapidly implemented. After the publication of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, the Beijing Opera Troupe and many other units held meetings to celebrate and conducted in-depth discussions. Many units also staged performances reflecting the spirit of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee and went to factories, rural communes, and military construction sites the next day to perform and propagate, receiving warm welcome from the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领文艺阵地
    认真帮助文艺战士提高路线斗争觉悟
    进驻首都文艺团体和艺术院校的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，广泛深入地向革命文艺战士和革命师生宣传毛泽东思想，进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育，并以言传身教的办法带思想、带政治、带作风，有效地推动了文艺领域的斗批改
    据新华社二日讯　遵照毛主席工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大教导进驻首都文艺团体和艺术院校的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，用毛泽东思想对知识分子实行无产阶级政治领导，认真帮助革命文艺战士和革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进人的思想革命化，有效地推动了文艺领域的斗、批、改。
    林副主席指示我们：
  “对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”首都工人、解放军宣传队自进驻文艺领域两个多月以来，在实行无产阶级政治领导中，把帮助革命文艺战士和革命师生进一步开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动、提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，放在一切工作的首位。他们组成上千支小分队，深入到班级、宿舍、排练场和琴房，广泛深入地向革命文艺战士和革命师生宣传毛泽东思想，进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育。北京京剧团、中央乐团、中国京剧团等样板团的工人、解放军宣传队，组织大家回顾了江青同志率领广大革命文艺战士进行京剧革命的斗争实践。许多宣传队请在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人向大家忆苦思甜，组织大家下厂、下乡，深入阶级斗争实际，请工人和贫下中农讲工厂和农村的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争史。宣传队还把工厂、部队活学活用毛泽东思想的好经验带到文艺团体和艺术院校，并且和艺术院校的革命师生结成“一组红”，以言传身教的办法带思想，带政治，带作风。
    经过工人、解放军宣传队一系列艰苦细致的工作，革命文艺战士和革命师生从解放十几年来两个阶级、两条路线激烈搏斗的历史事实中，深刻认识到刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义路线的罪恶，深刻认识到毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大，大大地增强了对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情。广大革命文艺战士和革命师生，对刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义文艺路线和反革命修正主义教育路线，广泛深入地开展了革命的大批判。他们采取列反革命修正主义路线的罪状，论危害，肃流毒，挖根源的办法，在革命大批判中活学活用毛泽东思想，大大增强了活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性。有的文艺战士手捧江青同志亲自赠送的《毛泽东选集》，激动地说：“江青同志率领我们进行文艺革命，才使我们真正开始为工农兵服务。过去我们自以为毛泽东思想学得差不多了，今天，同工人阶级和贫下中农一比，看到自己差得太远。千差万差，我们就差在没有在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”许多同志回顾自己多次受到毛主席亲切接见的难忘情景，对比旧社会艺人受压迫、受侮辱的惨痛经历，热泪盈眶地说：“毛主席是我们的大救星，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。我们一定要深入开展革命大批判，肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义路线在文艺领域中的一切流毒；一定老老实实地接受工农兵的再教育，在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，彻底改变自己的旧思想，一辈子为工农兵服务。”现在，在这些文艺团体和艺术院校里，毛泽东思想学习班遍地开花，活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会不断举行，批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的大字报到处都是，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动有了新的发展。
    工人、解放军宣传队在带领革命文艺战士和革命师生开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动中，狠抓人的思想革命化，认真帮助他们用毛泽东思想来改造自己的世界观。有些艺术院校的学生原来觉得自己家庭出身好，在文化大革命中没有站错队，学习毛主席著作没有什么问题可带。后来在宣传队的帮助下，他们回顾了自己带着红领巾走进学校，“头一年看不惯，第二年跟着干，第三年就大变”的过程，深刻认识到：毛泽东思想是文艺工作者的灵魂，过去叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇就是通过反对广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，企图把我们拉上资本主义的老路。我们一定要在工人阶级的领导下，活学活用毛主席著作，彻底同旧的传统、旧的观念决裂，成为共产主义一代新人。许多文艺战士通过活学活用毛主席著作，更加深刻地认识到政治挂帅的重要性，更加深刻地体会到“私”字的危害。他们说，艺术技巧再好，如果没有无产阶级政治头脑，不知道歌颂工农兵，不知道为无产阶级政治和工农兵服务，这样的艺术技巧不只是无用的，而且是有害的。他们表示决心以工人阶级为榜样，活学活用毛泽东思想，认真把立足点移到工农兵这方面来，走一辈子与工农兵相结合的道路，为工农兵服务一辈子。目前，在工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，首都各文艺团体和艺术院校的斗、批、改正在深入进行。广大革命文艺工作者和革命师生向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，清理阶级队伍的工作不断有所发展。各单位的政治空气已有了很大变化，毛主席的一系列最新指示正在迅速落实。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，北京京剧团等许多单位连夜召开大会举行庆祝，并且进行了深入的讨论，许多单位还编排了反映十二中全会公报精神的文艺节目，第二天就到工厂、农村人民公社和解放军施工场地进行宣传演出，受到了工农兵的热烈欢迎。
