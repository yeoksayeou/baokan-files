Following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "carrying out the proletarian educational revolution, which must be led by the working class, must have the participation of the working masses, and must always lead the schools," starting from late August this year, our factory took over the nearby Dong'an Road Primary School. After approval by the higher-level revolutionary committee, the school revolutionary committee was dissolved, and a certain number of school revolutionary committee members were elected into the factory revolutionary committee. The school was renamed "May 7th School of Changchun Towel Factory," achieving the working class's permanent leadership over the school.

Following Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive and in accordance with the wishes of our working class, a series of reforms were carried out in the school's teaching methods. Teachers and students take turns working in the factory, workers participate in teaching, and in their spare time, they study culture, rapidly changing the school's appearance.

After more than three months of practice, we have found that factories running schools have the following advantages:

1. It truly implements Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of the working class permanently leading the schools. Under the unified leadership of the factory revolutionary committee and with the direct participation of the working masses, it is possible to thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line, implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and firmly grasp the leadership of the schools in the hands of the working class, carrying the educational revolution to the end.

2. It better implements Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive. After changing public schools to factory-run schools, workers work and study, students study and work, and teachers teach and work, achieving "workers on the podium, teachers and students on the machine." Together, they criticize the bourgeoisie, learn military skills, learn agriculture, and participate in the three great revolutionary movements, gradually eliminating the three great differences, turning factories and schools into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

3. It is beneficial for the working class to re-educate intellectuals. In the past, "a street separated the factory and the school into two worlds," and some intellectuals in the school looked down on workers and did not approach them. Now, under the leadership of the working class, they work and study in the workshops with the workers, truly beginning to "renew their minds." This greatly benefits the ideological transformation of intellectuals.

4. It can reduce the state's burden. After teachers and students participate in labor, based on the value they create, after half a year, not only can they fully bear the entire school's educational expenses (office expenses, maintenance fees, and salaries for teachers and staff), but there is also a surplus, which can be remitted to the national treasury or gradually reduce students' tuition fees.

After our factory took over Dong'an Road Primary School, several nearby primary schools also requested that we manage them. This made us think of a problem: what if all public primary schools in the city are run by factories? We believe that in places where there are many factories and few schools, they should be appropriately paired with places where there are few factories and many schools. At the same time, according to the size of the factories, arrange the number of schools to be managed. Large factories can manage more, small factories can manage fewer, and very small factories can manage none. If there are schools nearby that need to be taken over and the factory has its own children's school, it is best to merge them and run them together.

    工厂办学校好处多
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，……并且永远领导学校”的教导，从今年八月下旬开始，我们工厂接管了附近的东安路小学。经上级革委会批准后，取消了学校革委会，推选一定数量的学校革委会成员进入工厂革委会，学校名称改为：长春市毛巾厂“五·七”学校，实现了工人阶级对学校的永远领导。
    遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，按照我们工人阶级的心愿，对学校的教学实行了一系列改革，教师学生轮流下厂劳动，工人参加教学，并在业余学习文化，迅速改变了学校面貌。
    经过三个多月的实践，我们感到工厂办学校有这样一些好处：
    一、真正实现了毛主席关于工人阶级永远领导学校的战略思想。在工厂革委会的统一领导下，在工人群众的直接参加下，就可以保证彻底砸烂修正主义教育路线，贯彻落实毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，把学校领导权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手里，将教育革命进行到底。
    二、更好地落实毛主席的“五·七”指示。把公办学校改为厂办以后，工人又做工又学习，学生又学习又做工，教师又教学又做工，做到“工人上讲台，师生上机台”。并且共同批判资产阶级，共同学军，学农，参加三大革命运动，逐步消灭三大差别，把工厂、学校都办成毛泽东思想大学校。
    三、有利于工人阶级对知识分子的再教育。过去，“一条街把工厂和学校隔成两个世界”，学校里的一些知识分子看不起工人，不接近工人。现在他们在工人阶级领导下进行工作和学习，下车间和工人一起劳动，真正在思想上开始“吐故纳新”。这就大大有利于知识分子的思想改造。
    四、可以减轻国家负担。师生参加劳动以后，就他们创造的价值计算，半年后不仅可以将全校教育经费（办公费、维修费和教职工工资）全部负担起来，而且还有一定余额，上缴国库或逐步减免学生的学费。
    我们工厂在领导东安路小学以后，附近好几个小学都要求我们厂把他们一起管起来，这就使我们想到了一个问题：如果全市的公办小学都实行厂办，怎么办？我们认为，在工厂多、学校少的地方，应当和工厂少、学校多的地方做适当搭配。同时，根据工厂的规模大小来安排管理学校的数量，大工厂适当多管，小工厂可以少管，过小的工厂也可以不管。工厂附近有学校需要接管，自己又有子弟学校的最好把他们合并起来办。
