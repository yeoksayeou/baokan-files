The grand ceremony for naming "The Tenth Company of the Engineering Corps on the Wind-Swept Plateau, Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao" was held recently in a certain location in the northwest.

The ceremony began with over ten thousand soldiers and revolutionary masses of the People's Liberation Army waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and chanting in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" They read aloud Mao's quotations: "The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is a great victory, but it is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road ahead is even longer, and the work is even greater and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a modest, prudent, unassuming, and unhurried attitude, and continue to maintain a spirit of hard struggle. We must be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly."

Engineering Corps Commander Chen Shigang read the order from the Central Military Commission and presented the banner "The Tenth Company of the Engineering Corps on the Wind-Swept Plateau, Unlimitedly Loyal to Chairman Mao" to the Tenth Company. Chen Shigang also spoke at the meeting. He said: The Central Military Commission's conferring of the honorable title on the Tenth Company is the greatest care, encouragement, education, and motivation from our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao for our engineering corps. After introducing the exemplary deeds of the Tenth Company, he emphasized that the experience of the Tenth Company and the engineering corps' construction experience boil down to one point: we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously arm the minds of all officers and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, and continue to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

At the meeting, Commander Zhang Daqi of the Lanzhou Military Region demanded that all officers and soldiers learn from the Tenth Company earnestly and truly master the good thoughts, good style, and good experience of the Tenth Company. He stressed that they must remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and continue to maintain a modest, prudent, unassuming, and unhurried attitude, and continue to maintain a spirit of hard struggle during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The representative of the Tenth Company said in his speech, "All the victories we have achieved are due to our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We will certainly study Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat more earnestly, forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, forever be modest and prudent, forever struggle hard, forever be full of vigor, and follow our great leader Chairman Mao forward bravely!"

Representatives from the local revolutionary committee, military leaders, and advanced collectives also spoke at the meeting.

Since the Central Military Commission issued the order, the People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps has extensively carried out activities to learn from the Tenth Company. All officers and soldiers, taking the Tenth Company as an example, have further carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, earnestly studied the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, and strived to raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and complete all the great combat tasks proposed by the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
