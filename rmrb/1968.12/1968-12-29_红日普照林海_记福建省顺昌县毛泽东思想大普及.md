The red sun shines over the forest sea—recording the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought in Shunchang County, Fujian Province

	“See the mountains turn red, and the forests all dyed.” In the foothills of Jiulong Mountain and along the banks of the Futu River in Fujian Province, the first city to establish a “three-in-one” revolutionary committee in the mountains—Shunchang County—under the help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary masses have undergone the tempering of the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They eagerly study and apply Chairman Mao's works. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they have launched fierce attacks on the class enemies; with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they bravely smash bourgeois ideology; with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they struggle against nature, and in the vast mountains and forests, they continuously create miracles.

	Every household reads the precious book

	Last February, the Shunchang County Revolutionary Committee was born in the storm of class struggle and led the revolutionary people of the entire county to carry out the “three loyalties” campaign of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This greatly inspired and deepened the revolutionary feelings of millions of people towards Chairman Mao. Now, every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao and sets up a stand for revolutionary classics.

	Every day, whether going up the mountains or down to the fields, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants carry the portrait of Chairman Mao and the red flag, holding the red “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” singing songs of quotations, and rushing to the fields. During labor, they also hold study sessions and criticism sessions, letting Mao Zedong Thought guide production and occupy every inch of land.

	“Not reading Chairman Mao's books is to forget one's roots after liberation and is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao.” This is a common saying among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary members in Shunchang County. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, men, women, old, and young all eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works, and many moving stories emerged. In the deep mountains and dense forests, a “Nine Elders” propaganda team was active. This team consisted of nine elderly women from the Red Star Brigade of Yuankuang Commune who had deep bitterness in the old society. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to “pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end,” they took the initiative to go out of their homes, connect with each other, and organize Mao Zedong Thought study groups. They were old, but they were not afraid; they had no education, but they were not deterred; the enemy cursed them, but they were not shaken; they had heavy household chores, but they were not held back. They were busy with household chores during the day and studied at night, often until midnight. They read sentence by sentence and recited passage by passage, very seriously. Old woman Zhou Chunyi, whether doing household chores or working in the fields, always recited the “Three Articles.” At night, she often read until the third watch. These old women said: “We poor and lower-middle peasants must remember our blood and tears, love the new society, and we must always read Chairman Mao's books and always be loyal to Chairman Mao.” They also went to various production teams to share their experiences and promote Mao Zedong Thought. In March of this year, the 85-year-old old woman Zhang Youbin, lying in bed with a serious illness, still asked her grandchildren to read the “Three Articles” to her by her bedside. Before her death, she asked her grandchildren to help her sit up and gave her a notebook and a pen. She tightly grasped the pen, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and wrote down the five shining golden characters “Long live Chairman Mao” one by one.

	The children of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade saw the old women studying Chairman Mao's works seriously and also organized a “Youth Mao Zedong Thought Study Class,” with the oldest being 13 years old and the youngest only 4 years old. Now, this study class has grown from the initial few people to more than 60.

	Red hearts forever toward the red sun, every household reads the precious book. Now, in the deep mountains and forests of Shunchang City and countryside, a wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has swept through everywhere, and the entire county has seen moving examples of “late bloomers,” “couple reds,” “three-generation reds,” and “full-house reds.” Since this year, the entire county has distributed nearly 30,000 copies of the “Selected Works of Mao Zedong,” which is sixteen times the total distribution before 1967. The county has held nearly 5,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with 268,000 participants, fully reflecting the boundless love and loyalty of the revolutionary people of Shunchang to Chairman Mao.

	Make the mountains and rivers red forever

	The revolutionary people of Shunchang County remember Chairman Mao's teachings and, after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, never forget class struggle and never forget proletarian dictatorship. They actively and continuously launched fierce attacks on class enemies. From cities to villages, from communes and production teams to the homes of community members, revolutionary criticism battles were set up everywhere. Elderly poor and lower-middle peasants led the youth to the scenes where class enemies once harmed revolutionary people, denouncing the crimes of the enemies; revolutionary community members, at the fields where Liu Shaoqi promoted the “three freedoms and one contract,” angrily exposed Liu Shaoqi's crimes of destroying the collective economy; even children actively participated in the great criticism.

	The surging tide of revolutionary criticism swept away the mud and dirt left over from the old society, making the class enemies tremble with fear. The revolutionary people exposed the class enemies on the surface and, through exposing the enemy situation, dug out deeply hidden class enemies.

	The invincible Mao Zedong Thought can see through everything and change everything. Originally, the Jiangdun Brigade, located at the junction of four counties, with high mountains and dense forests, scattered households, and rampant class enemy activities, was a “difficult-to-handle” unit. After studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to expose the class struggle, the class enemies were quickly and accurately grabbed, changing the face of the brigade.

	The waves of class struggle washed over the deep mountains and forests. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shunchang County raised their heads and smiled, saying excitedly: We must follow the great commander Chairman Mao, continue to attack the class enemies, carry the revolution to the end, and make the mountains and rivers red forever!

	Break private interests and establish public spirit to forge a red heart

	The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines on every inch of Shunchang, reddening the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary community members. They carry the “Three Articles” with them, remember them in their hearts, study them wherever they go, and use them wherever they go, creating countless selfless and revolutionary new people.

	Young community member Kong Nuomi, who was once called a “work points fanatic,” is now praised by everyone as “public-spirited.” He is the brigade's first plowman, plowing fast and well. However, this “good plowman” was once blown off course by the black wind of “work points in command” and “material incentives.” During the busy season of harvesting and planting, he did not go to plow the fields but went to cut rice because cutting rice could earn more work points. Recently, he participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the brigade, studying the “Three Articles” with old poor peasants and listening to their bitter experiences. The more he listened, the more he felt that working for work points was wrong. He said excitedly in the study class: “In the past, I worked for work points, which was falling for Liu Shaoqi's trick and sliding towards revisionism. In the future, I will follow Chairman Mao's words, be like Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, selfless and dedicated to the people.” One day, he saw that four plows in the brigade were broken. He thought: The more plows, the faster the land is plowed, which can catch the season, produce more grain, and benefit the country and the collective. Therefore, he ignored his fatigue and worked for four consecutive nights, repairing all the broken plows. When recording work points, everyone unanimously wanted to give him more work points, but he firmly refused. People praised him: “Breaking private interests and establishing public spirit to forge a red heart, completely and thoroughly for the people, he is our good successor!”

	Cow herder Chen Yubin is an old poor peasant who loves cows like his own children. He studies and applies the “Three Articles,” breaking down “selfishness” and establishing “public spirit.” In the second half of 1966, the community members elected him as the herder. As soon as he took the cow rope in his hand, he thought: I must follow Chairman Mao's words, herd cows for the revolution, and walk the socialist road, and I must not let “selfishness” lead me by the nose. He voluntarily proposed to the brigade to record the same work points as other community members and refused to accept any bonuses. He often used the “completely” and “thoroughly” ruler to measure himself, feeding the three cows to be fat and healthy, adding five calves to the brigade, all of which survived. When one calf fell ill, he and his family took care of it day and night like caring for a sick person, and finally nursed the calf back to health. Since this year, in addition to taking care of the cows, he has also found time to participate in collective labor for more than 50 days.

	With red hearts fighting against heaven and earth

	The people of Shunchang County, with boundless love for Chairman Mao in their hearts, rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to seize the revolution and promote production, overcoming a once-in-fifty-years drought and a once-in-sixty-years major flood.

	This summer, during the early rice heading and flowering season, heavy rain fell continuously, mountain floods surged, and rivers rose rapidly. Eight communes and five forest farms in the entire county were affected by the disaster.

	The revolutionary people of Shunchang, facing the severe disaster situation, put forward the resounding battle slogan: “With red hearts fighting against heaven and earth, seizing a bumper harvest in a disaster year.” The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, on the front line of flood control and rescue, held study classes, turning the front line of flood control and rescue into a battlefield for breaking “selfishness” and establishing “public spirit.”

	In the heavily affected area of Yuankuang Commune Jiaoxi Brigade, not a single poor and lower-middle peasant moved out. Everyone had one heart, rescuing collective property in the storm and rain. Brigade leader Zhang Congyun rowed a small boat back and forth, rescuing collective property until late at night, still holding a torch to rescue dozens of loads of human manure from two brigade manure pits.

	Poor peasant Huang Biquing, in order to protect the brigade's granary, braved the wind and rain, laying the tiles blown away by the wind on the roof of the warehouse one by one. The wind blew again, and he laid them again until the warehouse did not leak water.

	Before the floodwater had completely receded, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants had come to the fields to wash seedlings and replant, digging out the rice seedlings buried by several inches of river silt, washing them clean, and straightening them up. After two days, the floodwater came again, submerging the rice fields. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants were not discouraged and continued to display the heroic spirit of fighting against nature, battling the floodwater.

	Just as the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiaoxi Brigade were working hard in the rice fields that had not yet been completely flooded by the floodwater, eleven elderly women from Fufeng Brigade, holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao, walked through the muddy field paths from twenty miles away. The old women brought the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to their class brothers. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shadian Brigade in Yangkou Commune also brought seedlings from forty miles away. Many neighboring brigades also sent their best labor force to support them. With the help of community members from brother brigades, the 800-plus mu of disaster-affected fields in Jiaoxi Brigade, which had been hit by floods three times, still achieved a bumper harvest.

	After the floodwater receded, the “head-killing insect” came. This insect is very harmful to rice. In the past, it was treated every year, but it still appeared every year. This year, the poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's teaching that “in the world, the most feared thing is the word ‘serious,’ and the Communist Party is the most serious about it.” They used magnifying glasses to seriously observe the breeding habits of this harmful insect. After repeated research, they finally subdued the “head-killing insect,” making the rice bloom and yield a bumper harvest as usual.

	This year, the vast fields of Shunchang are filled with good news of harvests. The total grain output of the entire county is the highest in history. Moreover, it created the historical miracle of late-season rice surpassing early-season rice in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian. The revolutionary people of Shunchang, seeing the prosperous revolutionary scene under the brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, looking forward to the future of a splendid career, all burst out with a common voice: “Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!”

    红日普照林海
    ——记福建省顺昌县毛泽东思想大普及
    “看万山红遍，层林尽染”。在福建省的九龙山麓，富屯溪畔，第一个建立“三结合”革命委员会的山城——顺昌县，在人民解放军的帮助下，广大革命人民群众，经历了无产阶级文化大革命烈火的锤炼，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作。他们，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，向阶级敌人发动了猛烈的进攻；他们，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，勇猛地冲击着资产阶级思想；他们，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，与天斗，与地斗，在纵横数百里的深山密林之间，不断地创造出人间奇迹。
    家家户户读宝书
    去年二月，顺昌县革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中一诞生，便带领全县革命人民开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，大大激发和加深了千万革命人民对毛主席的无产阶级感情。现在，家家户户高挂毛主席像，设置革命宝书台。
    每天，上山下田，广大贫下中农都高举毛主席像和红旗，带着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，唱着语录歌，奔向田间。在劳动时，他们还召开讲用会、批判会，让毛泽东思想指挥生产，占领每一寸土地。
      “不读毛主席的书，就是翻身忘本，就是对毛主席最大不忠。”这是顺昌县广大贫下中农和革命社员共同的一句话。在无产阶级文化大革命中，男女老少，都如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，出现了许许多多动人的事迹。在重山密林中，活跃着一支“九老”宣传队。这支宣传队，是由元坑公社红星大队九位在旧社会苦大仇深的老大娘组成的。她们在伟大领袖毛主席发出
  “你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召后，就主动走出家门，互相串连，组织起学习毛主席著作小组。年纪大，吓不倒；没文化，难不倒；敌人骂，攻不倒；家务重，拖不倒。她们白天家务忙，晚上学，一学就是半夜。她们一句句地读、一遍遍地背，十分认真。老大娘邹春娣，不论做家务还是下田劳动，时刻都在背诵“老三篇”，晚上经常读到三更半夜。这些老大娘说：“我们贫下中农就是要牢记血泪仇，热爱新社会，我们要永远读毛主席的书，永远忠于毛主席。”她们还到各个生产队去现身说法，宣传毛泽东思想。今年三月，八十五岁的老大娘张有俤，重病卧床，还要儿孙们在床前读“老三篇”给她听。临终前，她还叫儿孙扶她坐起来，给她拿来本子和笔。她紧紧地握着笔杆，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，一笔一划，端端正正写下了“毛主席万岁”五个金光闪闪的大字。
    这个大队贫下中农的子女，看到老大娘认真学习毛主席著作，也组织起了“少年毛泽东思想学习班”，其中最大的十三岁，最小的只有四岁。现在这个学习班，已从最初的几个人发展到六十多人。
    红心永向红太阳，家家户户读宝书。现在，在深山林海的顺昌城乡，处处掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮，全县到处出现了活学活用毛泽东思想的“老来红”、“夫妻一对红”、“三代红”、“全家互学满堂红”的动人事例。今年以来，全县发行《毛泽东选集》近三万部，等于一九六七年以前发行总数的十六倍。全县举办的各种类型毛泽东思想学习班将近五千期，参加学习的达二十六万八千多人次，充分体现了顺昌广大革命人民群众对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚。
    定叫山河万代红
    顺昌县广大革命人民，牢记毛主席的教导，在革委会成立以后，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，主动持续地向阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。从城镇到山村，从公社、生产队到社员家庭，处处摆下了革命大批判的战场。年老的贫下中农，带着青少年到过去阶级敌人残害革命人民的杀人场，控诉敌人的罪行；革命的社员，在刘少奇推行“三自一包”的田头，愤怒地揭露刘少奇破坏集体经济的罪行；少年儿童也积极参加大批判。
    革命大批判的洪流，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水，使阶级敌人闻风丧胆。广大革命人民揪出了浮在面上的阶级敌人，又通过摆敌情，挖出隐蔽很深的阶级敌人。
    威力无比的毛泽东思想，能够洞察一切，改变一切。原来的江墩大队，因处在四个县的交界处，山高林密，住户分散，阶级敌人活动猖獗，一直是个“老大难”单位。经过大学毛主席著作，依靠贫下中农大揭阶级斗争盖子，很快就稳准狠地把阶级敌人揪了出来，使这个大队改变了面貌。
    阶级斗争的浪涛冲刷着深山密林。顺昌广大贫下中农扬眉吐气，喜笑颜开。他们兴奋地说：我们一定要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，继续向阶级敌人进攻，将革命进行到底，定叫江山万代红！
    破私立公炼红心
    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，照耀着顺昌的每一寸土地，照红了广大贫下中农和革命社员的心。他们把
  “老三篇”带在身边，记在心间，走到哪里，学到哪里，用到哪里，涌现出成千成万一心为公，一心为革命的共产主义新人。
    青年社员孔糯米，过去有人叫他“工分迷”，现在人人夸他“公字化”。他是队里的第一把犁手，犁得快，犁得好。可是，这个“好犁手”，一度被“工分挂帅”
  “物质刺激”的黑风吹得转了向。在抢收抢种的紧张季节，他不去犁田，却要去割稻，因为割稻可以多挣工分。不久前，他参加了队里办的毛泽东思想学习班，跟老贫农一起学习“老三篇”，听老贫农忆苦思甜。他越听越感到自己干活为了挣工分，不对头。他在学习班上激动地说：“我过去干活为工分，这是上了刘少奇的当，是往修正主义路上滑。以后我要听毛主席的话，象张思德、白求恩那样，毫不利己专门利人，完全彻底为人民。”一天，他见到队里有四部犁坏了。他想：犁多翻地快，可以赶季节，多打粮，对国家对集体有利。于是，他不顾疲劳，连续干了四个晚上，把坏犁全部修好。记工时，大家一致要给他多记工分，他坚决不要。人们赞扬说：“破私立公炼红心，完全彻底为人民，是我们的好接班人！”
    耕牛饲养员陈跃彬，是一位“爱牛如子”的老贫农。他活学活用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。一九六六年下半年，社员们选他担任了饲养员。牛绳子一拿到手，他就想：我要听毛主席的话，为革命牵牛绳子，走社会主义道路，决不能让“私”字牵着鼻子走。他主动向队里提出同别的社员记一样的工分，并拒绝接受任何奖金。他经常用“完全”“彻底”这把尺子来衡量自己，把三头母牛喂得膘肥体壮，给队里添了五头小牛，头头成活。有头小牛病了，他和全家人象侍候病人一样，日夜照料，终于把小牛养好了。今年以来，他除了看管牛，还挤出时间参加集体劳动五十多天。
    胸怀红日斗天地
    顺昌县广大群众怀着对毛主席无限热爱的红心，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，抓革命、促生产，战胜了五十年来罕见的大旱，六十年来未有的特大洪水。
    今年夏天，正值早稻抽穗扬花时节，滂沱大雨连绵不断，山洪暴发，溪水猛涨，全县八个公社和五个林场，都遭了灾。
    顺昌革命人民，面对严重灾情，提出了响亮的战斗口号：“胸怀红日斗天地，灾年夺丰收。”广大贫下中农和革命干部，在抗洪抢险的第一线，举办了学习班，把抗洪抢险斗争第一线，当作破“私”立“公”的战场。
    在重灾区元坑公社蛟溪大队，没有一个贫下中农搬家，大家一个心眼，在暴风雨中抢救集体财产。大队长张聪云，划着小船，往返抢运集体财产，直到深夜还点着火把将大队两个粪坑里的几十担人粪尿抢运走。
    贫农黄必清，为了保护大队的粮仓，冒着狂风暴雨，把仓库屋顶上被风吹走的瓦，一片一片地铺好。风再掀，他再铺，直到仓库不漏雨水。
    洪水还没有退完，广大贫下中农已来到田地里洗苗、补种，把被几寸厚河泥埋了的稻苗一株株挖出来，洗净，扶正。过了两天，洪水又来了，再次淹没了稻田。但是，贫下中农毫不气馁，继续发扬战天斗地的英雄气概，与洪水战斗。
    正当蛟溪大队的贫下中农，在洪水还没退尽的稻田里紧张地劳动时，福丰大队的十一位贫下中农老大娘，高举毛主席像，踩着泥泞的田间小道，从二十里以外赶来。老大娘们给阶级兄弟送来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。洋口公社沙垱大队的贫下中农，也从四十里外给他们送苗来了。不少邻近大队还派了最好的劳力来支援。在兄弟队社员的援助下，蛟溪大队被洪水连续三次袭击的八百多亩受灾田仍然夺得了丰收。
    洪水过去了，又来了“杀头虫”。这种虫对水稻危害很大。过去，年年治，年年有。今年，贫下中农遵照毛主席“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’”的教导，用放大镜认真观察这种害虫的繁殖规律，经过反复研究，终于把“杀头虫”制服了，使水稻照常吐穗扬花，获得丰收。
    今年顺昌的广阔田野，丰收喜讯频传。全县粮食总产量，是有史以来最高的一年。而且，还创造了在闽北山区晚季超早季的历史奇迹。顺昌革命人民，眼看着毛泽东思想灿烂阳光照耀下的欣欣向荣的革命景象，展望着未来的锦绣前程，都情不自禁地迸发出一个共同的声音：“祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
