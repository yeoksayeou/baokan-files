The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an editorial article on December 29, enthusiastically celebrating China's successful test of a new hydrogen bomb. The article, titled "A Great Achievement of the Great Chinese People," praises the Chinese people's great victories under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The article states that the world has received the joyous news that the great people of China successfully conducted another new hydrogen bomb test on December 27. This is another glorious victory. It demonstrates the great power of the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, and is a great encouragement to all revolutionary people and Marxist-Leninists around the world. The new hydrogen bomb test is also a heavy blow to the nuclear monopoly and counter-revolutionary plans of the American imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists following the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article states that the victories of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and production, as well as the victories achieved by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government's firm adherence to Marxist-Leninist principles in foreign policy, have made the great people of China an invincible force for socialism and revolution. The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Union, along with all reactionaries, tremble in the face of this force and the undeniable prestige of the Chinese giant. Now, no force in the world can stop the victorious march of the great Chinese people.

The article states that 1968 was a year of magnificent victories for the Chinese people in all fields of political, economic, and social activities. In this year, the hundreds of millions of workers, soldiers, revolutionary youth, Red Guards, laboring peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of China further tenaciously threw themselves into the mighty torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong. Now, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees—the organs of proletarian power—have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout China. This victory signifies the triumph of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist revolutionary thought, the bankruptcy of the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, the triumph of proletarian dictatorship and socialism in China, and the demise of revisionism and capitalism in China. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the magnificent victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and presented the Party, the working class, and all the people of China with the historic task of carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The article states that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is of great significance not only to China but also to the entire proletariat and revolutionary forces of the world. Comrade Enver Hoxha said at the reception held by the Chinese Embassy to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an inexhaustible source of inspiration for the revolutionary people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism and aggression. It provides a brilliant example for revolutionary people to overthrow the revisionist cliques that have usurped the leadership of the party and the state in their respective countries."

The article states that due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great people of China have become even stronger. Her political, economic, and military power is stronger than ever before.

The article states that the Albanian people are overjoyed by the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》发表编辑部文章
    热烈欢呼中国新的氢弹试验成功
    这一辉煌胜利是对世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞，对帝修反的又一沉重打击
    新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十九日发表题为《伟大的中国人民的巨大成就》的编辑部文章，热烈欢呼我国成功地进行了又一次新的氢弹试验，热烈赞扬我国人民在毛主席的领导下在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利。文章说，全世界获悉喜讯，伟大的人民中国在十二月二十七日成功地进行了又一次新的氢弹试验。这是又一个辉煌的胜利。它显示了伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的巨大力量，是对全世界一切革命人民和马克思列宁主义者的巨大鼓舞。新的氢弹试验也是继无产阶级文化大革命取得的胜利后对美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者的核垄断和反革命计划的又一个沉重打击。
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命和生产方面的胜利，以及中国共产党和中国政府坚决遵循的马克思列宁主义的原则性的对外政策所取得的胜利，使伟大的人民中国成了社会主义和革命的一支坚不可摧的力量。以美帝为首的帝国主义者和以苏修为中心的现代修正主义者以及一切反动派，在这支力量面前，在中国巨人的不可争辩的威望面前吓得发抖。现在世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡伟大的中国人民的胜利的步伐。
    文章说，一九六八年对中国人民来说，是在政治、经济和社会活动的一切领域中取得宏伟胜利的一年。中国亿万工人、战士、革命青年、红卫兵、劳动农民和革命知识分子在这一年中进一步顽强地投入到由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的强大洪流中去。现在，全中国除台湾省以外，已经在各省、市、自治区建立了无产阶级权力机构——革命委员会。这一胜利标志着毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的革命思想的胜利，标志着叛徒刘少奇及其同伙的破产，标志着无产阶级专政和社会主义在中国的胜利以及修正主义和资本主义在中国的完蛋。中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会总结了无产阶级文化大革命的宏伟胜利，向党、工人阶级和全体中国人民提出了为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的历史性任务。文章说，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利不仅对于中国，而且对于整个无产阶级和全世界革命力量都具有重要意义。恩维尔·霍查同志在中国大使馆为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年的国庆招待会上说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命是各国革命人民在反对帝国主义和反对侵略的斗争中取之不尽的鼓舞源泉，它为革命人民推翻各地篡夺了党和国家领导权的修正主义集团，提供了一个光辉的榜样。”
    文章说，由于无产阶级文化大革命，伟大的人民中国变得更加坚强。她的政治、经济和军事力量比以往任何时候都强大。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大胜利，感到衷心的高兴。
