Workers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, who are fighting on the frontlines of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings that "the working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness through struggle." They strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, participate in labor, and combat the slightest thoughts of selfishness in their minds, fully demonstrating their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao.

This "bath" is indispensable

Sun Peifang, a worker from the Yinchuan Rubber Factory and a member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Yinchuan No. 1 Middle School, rushed back to the factory on the first Sunday after arriving at the school. He changed into his work clothes and headed straight to the workshop to start working. Hearing the familiar roar of the machines and seeing his old comrades in their work clothes, covered in oil, he felt an indescribable joy. The foreman, seeing him start working immediately, said with concern, "You're already working hard in the propaganda team, getting up early to exercise and often working late into the night. On a Sunday, you should at least change your clothes and take a bath!" Sun Peifang, however, laughed and said, "Putting on work clothes is like putting on the best, cleanest clothes; participating in production labor is like taking a bath, because it washes away the dust from one's mind. This 'bath' must be taken regularly!"

Since joining the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, Sun Peifang has insisted on returning to the factory every Sunday to participate in production labor. He said, "If you don't participate in labor regularly, your hands will become soft, your waist will ache, and your thoughts will change. So, on some Sundays, he works all day and then goes to the workshop to work for a while in the evening, and the next morning, he still arrives at the school on time. When the factory and propaganda team comrades praised him, he said, "Only by participating in production labor regularly can we maintain the character of the working class. Only by continuously raising our political consciousness through struggle can we shoulder the great historical mission given to us by Chairman Mao to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure."

Facing difficulties, "move mountains" instead of "moving homes"

Li Fengzhen, a member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Yinchuan No. 1 Middle School, is praised by the revolutionary teachers and students as "a good worker sent by Chairman Mao, a good example for us to learn from." Other propaganda teams and the supporting PLA soldiers also say, "A female comrade, fearless of hardship and fatigue, working diligently and always ahead of others, is truly a model."

Li Fengzhen is a mother of four children, with the eldest only fifteen years old, and there is also an elderly person over seventy in her home. When she was selected as one of the first batch of Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team members, someone worriedly said, "You have a lot of household chores and burdens, can you leave?" However, Li Fengzhen firmly said, "No matter how big personal matters are, they are not as important as the tasks given to us by the working class by Chairman Mao." She thought, in the old society, women had no status and no political rights, and could only stay around the stove. In the new society, women have been liberated, and workers, regardless of gender, are the masters of the state. Chairman Mao said, "The working class must lead everything." Chairman Mao has given us such a high political status and entrusted us with such a heavy responsibility. If we consider our own interests first when facing difficulties, how can we be worthy of the great leader Chairman Mao?

Li Fengzhen brought Chairman Mao's latest instructions to Yinchuan No. 1 Middle School. When she first arrived at the school, she saw that some students were late or left early for meetings and study sessions, and there were serious issues of disorganization and lack of discipline. This situation made her think: Can I handle the work of a whole class by myself? Soon, the propaganda team comrades studied "Three Articles" together, checked their work, and their own revolutionary thoughts. She grasped her own active thoughts, compared them with the glorious image of "Old Man Moving Mountains," and fought against the "selfishness" in her mind. She said, "Old Man Moving Mountains" encountered a big mountain and moved the mountain instead of moving his home. I encountered such a small difficulty, and my thoughts wanted to move my home. This does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Communist Party members must have vitality, must have a firm revolutionary will, and must have the spirit of overcoming any difficulty with unyielding will." I will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. After that, Li Fengzhen used Mao Zedong Thought to arm the students' minds, and the situation in that class changed dramatically.

Recently, a large number of graduates have responded to Chairman Mao's great call, enthusiastically signing up to go to the mountains and countryside to participate in labor. In addition to doing a good job of students' ideological and political work, Li Fengzhen also tirelessly visited students' families, doing ideological work for the students' parents. On rainy days, she wore a straw hat, rolled up her pants, went from one family to another, from the city to the suburbs, regardless of day or night, working under the stars and moonlight. Now, Comrade Li Fengzhen is happy to see that the students in her class are joyfully stepping onto the bright path of integrating with workers and peasants.

Finding problems in praise

One day, Wu Bing, a member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Ningxia Art Troupe, was studying Chairman Mao's works with the actors when the mailman delivered that day's "Ningxia Daily," which published one of his commentaries. Some people in the art troupe saw it and started praising him. Wu Bing's face turned red, but his heart was also happy.

He returned to his dormitory, picked up a cup to drink water, and happened to see a newspaper on the table with a story about a revolutionary old cadre who, for decades, has been diligently serving the people without seeking personal gain or pride. The article quoted Chairman Mao's teachings prominently in front of him: "The victory of the revolution is only the first step in the long march of ten thousand li. ... We must always maintain the style of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant or impatient, and we must always maintain the style of hard struggle."

Comrade Wu Bing thought about his own feelings when he heard the praise just now, and he felt that Chairman Mao's words were shining with gold, and each word struck his heart. His mind was in turmoil: In the past, the newspaper also published his articles, and he thought it was what he should do, but now why did he have a feeling of "greatness"? Isn't this the bourgeoisie's idea of fame and profit attacking him? He also thought, he is a young worker, his work clothes have not been worn out a few times, and now he is in charge of leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation in a unit full of intellectuals and deeply influenced by bourgeois ideas of fame and profit. If he does not always be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets, he may be infected by bourgeois ideas of fame and profit and fail to shoulder the responsibility of transforming the art team with the appearance of the working class. Thinking of this, his heart became clear. That night, he opened the shining "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. From then on, every time the propaganda team held a meeting to share experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, he would connect his own active thoughts, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. In his work, he would not be proud of his achievements, find flaws after winning a battle, and strictly require himself to always follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

    在革命化的大道上奋勇前进
    ——记宁夏回族自治区工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员狠抓自身革命化的故事
    战斗在斗、批、改前线的宁夏回族自治区工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的伟大教导，狠抓本身思想革命化。他们努力活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持参加劳动，狠抓头脑里私字一闪念，充分表现了他们无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质。
        这个“澡”非洗不可
    进驻银川一中的工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员、银川橡胶厂工人孙珀方，在进驻学校后的第一个星期天，便赶忙跑回工厂，换上工作服，径直走向车间，干起活来。他听到好几天没有听到的隆隆的机器声，看到身穿工作服、满身油污的老战友，感到格外亲切，心里说不出有多么高兴。老师傅看到他一回来就干活，便十分关切地说：“你在宣传队工作就够辛苦了，早晨起来跑操，晚上经常工作到深夜，星期天回来，还不赶紧先换换衣服，洗洗澡！”孙珀方却笑呵呵地说：“穿上工作服，就是我换上最好、最干净的衣服；参加生产劳动就是‘洗澡’，因为参加生产劳动才能洗去思想上的灰尘，这个‘澡’非经常洗不可！”
    孙珀方从参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队以后，每个星期天都坚持回厂参加生产劳动。他说，不经常参加劳动就会手软、腰痠、思想变。所以有的星期天，他白天干一天活，晚上还要到车间去干一阵子，第二天大清早还按时赶到学校。当工厂和宣传队的同志表扬他时，他说：“只有经常参加生产劳动，才能保持咱工人阶级的本色。只有在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，才能担负起毛主席交给我们领导上层建筑领域里的斗、批、改的伟大历史使命。”
    在困难面前“搬山”不“搬家”
    进驻银川一中的工人毛泽东思想宣传队有个队员叫李凤珍，这个学校的革命师生人人都称赞她是“毛主席派来的好工人，是我们学习的好榜样”。驻校的其他宣传队员和支左的解放军同志也说：“一个女同志，不怕苦，不怕累，工作踏踏实实，处处走在别人头里，真是个好样的。”
    李凤珍是四个孩子的母亲，最大的一个孩子才十五岁，家里还有一个七十多岁的老人。当她被选派为第一批工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员时，有人就替她担心地说：“你家务活重，拖累大，能离得开吗？”可是李凤珍却坚决地说：“个人的事情再大，也没有毛主席交给我们工人阶级的任务大。”她想，在旧社会，我们妇女没有地位，更谈不上什么政治权利，只能围着锅台转。新社会，我们妇女得到了翻身、解放，工人不分男女都是国家的主人。毛主席说：“工人阶级必须领导一切”。毛主席给了我们这么高的政治地位，交给我们这么重的担子，如果遇事先替自己打算，怎能对得起伟大领袖毛主席呢？
    李凤珍带着毛主席的最新指示来到了银川一中。她乍一来到学校，看到有些学生开会、学习时，迟到早退，无组织、无纪律的现象比较严重。这种情况使她思想上产生了一个念头：我一个人担负一个班的工作，能搞得好吗？不久，宣传队的同志们在一块学习“老三篇”，对照检查工作和自身的思想革命化，她抓住自己的那个活思想，对照“老愚公”的光辉形象，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。她说，“老愚公”碰到大山是搬山不搬家，我碰到这么点困难，思想上就想搬家，这不符合毛主席的教导。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员一定要有朝气，一定要有坚强的革命意志，一定要有不怕困难和用百折不挠的意志去克服任何困难的精神”。我一定按照毛主席的教导去做。此后，李凤珍用毛泽东思想去武装同学们的头脑，那个班的情况，发生了巨大的变化。
    最近，大批毕业生响应毛主席的伟大号召，纷纷报名上山下乡，参加劳动。李凤珍除了做好学生的思想政治工作以外，还不辞辛苦地一家一户访问学生家庭，做学生家长的思想工作。大雨天，她戴上草帽，卷起裤腿，从这家到那家，从市内到城外，不分早晚，披星戴月地进行工作。现在，李凤珍同志高兴地看到，自己班里的同学愉快地踏上了与工农相结合的光明大道。
        赞扬声中找问题
    一天，驻宁夏文工团的工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员武冰正和演员们一起学习毛主席著作，邮递员送来了当天的《宁夏日报》，上面登载了他写的一篇评论文章。文工团的有些人一看，就赞扬起来。武冰听了，脸顿时涨得通红，可心里也乐滋滋的。
    他回到宿舍，拿起杯子喝水的时候，正好看到桌子上放着一张报纸，上面登着一位革命老干部不居功、不骄傲，几十年如一日勤勤恳恳为人民服务的事迹。文章中引用的毛主席的教导非常醒目地展现在他的眼前：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    武冰同志联系到刚才自己听了赞扬的心情，他觉得毛主席的话字字句句闪金光，字字句句敲在自己的心头上。他的脑海里顿时翻腾起来：过去报上也登过自己的文章，自己觉得这是应该做的，而现在为什么会产生一种“了不起”的感觉？这不是资产阶级的名利思想在向自己进攻了吗？他又想，自己是个青年工人，工作服还没有穿破几件，现在又在知识分子成堆、资产阶级名利思想影响很深的文艺单位担负领导斗、批、改的重任，如果不时刻警惕糖衣炮弹的攻击，就可能受到资产阶级名利思想的侵蚀，担负不起用工人阶级的面貌改造文艺队伍的任务。想到这里，他心里亮堂了。当晚，他又翻开金光闪闪的《毛泽东选集》，反复地学习了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告。从此以后，每当宣传队里开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会时，他就联系自己的活思想，斗私批修。在工作中，做出成绩不骄傲，打了胜仗找缺点，严格地要求自己永远按照毛主席指引的方向前进。　新华社记者
