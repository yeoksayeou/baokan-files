In October of this year, the Jinjiaba Production Brigade in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, engaged in a fierce battle and successfully eradicated a rare "rice leafhopper" pest that had not been seen in decades. At that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade requested that the Nantun Primary School teach a lesson on the control of the "rice leafhopper." This posed a significant challenge for the teachers of the school. "The most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." When those teachers who had previously relied solely on textbooks found themselves at a loss, the "barefoot teacher"—old peasant Ji Jinchu—stepped in to teach this lesson.

After arriving at the school, old peasant Ji Jinchu led more than eighty teachers and students to the edge of a rice field that still had some "rice leafhopper" damage. He first had everyone catch some "rice leafhoppers." The students, holding the "rice leafhoppers" they had caught, eagerly went to old peasant Ji Jinchu for answers. Ji Jinchu then began teaching the students by the rice field, explaining the types, shapes, reproduction, and growth of the "rice leafhopper," how it bores into the rice stems to suck the chlorophyll, causing the rice to wither and die, and how to prevent and control it.

Next, old peasant Ji Jinchu led the students back to the classroom and, using the "rice leafhopper" as a starting point, conducted a class on class education, contrasting the old and new societies. He said: Twenty-eight years ago, we also had an outbreak of "rice leafhoppers" here. That year, I farmed twelve mu of land for a landlord, and six mu were affected. At that time, there were no pesticides, so I could only sprinkle rice straw ash, but it was useless. I cried in the fields, and in the end, six mu of land yielded nothing. By the end of the year, the ruthless landlord still demanded three shi of rent for twelve mu of land. I was forced to flee and beg for food. Many poor and lower-middle peasants were driven to desperation, some even selling their children. At this time, the heartless landlords used the rent they collected to lend money at high interest, ruthlessly exploiting us poor and lower-middle peasants. Ji Jinchu's blood-curdling account stirred up deep hatred in the students for the exploiting classes.

Suddenly, old peasant Ji Jinchu's brow relaxed, and he spoke with great excitement: This year's "rice leafhopper" outbreak was much more severe than the one twenty-eight years ago. However, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, after discovering the "rice leafhopper," the commune revolutionary committee immediately mobilized the masses to fight against the pest, while also quickly distributing pesticides to each brigade. The commune revolutionary committee members and brigade cadres also went to the fields, working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants to spray pesticides. After a few days of intense battle, the "rice leafhopper" was eradicated. This year, our brigade's yield will not only not decrease but will even exceed the highest yield in history, which was in 1966. Old peasant Ji Jinchu spoke with increasing vigor, and the students listened with growing excitement, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the new society, shouting in unison:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

This innovative lesson sparked a strong response. Many poor and lower-middle peasants praised it, saying: This lesson was well-taught! Many students happily said: We understood and learned from this lesson. Those teachers who had previously felt at a loss also gained insight from this innovative lesson, deeply feeling that this lesson was not only a lively agricultural knowledge class but also a vivid class on class education. The poor and lower-middle peasants brought the class to life, truly showing their talent.

    从地头到课堂
    今年十月，江苏省吴江县金家坝公社跃进大队经过紧张战斗，扑灭了一场几十年来少见的“稻飞虱”虫灾。当时，贫下中农要求本大队的南町小学上一堂治“稻飞虱”的农业知识课。这件事可难坏了学校里的老师，“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”在那些过去只靠书本进行教学的教师感到毫无办法的时候，“赤脚老师”——老贫农计锦初来担任了这一课。
    老贫农计锦初到学校后，把八十多名师生带到还有一些“稻飞虱”虫害的稻田埂岸上，先叫大家抓“稻飞虱”。学生拿着抓到的“稻飞虱”纷纷去向老贫农计锦初请教。计锦初就在稻田边给学生们讲起课来，讲了“稻飞虱”的种类形状、繁殖生长、怎样钻进稻茎内吸取叶绿素使稻枯死和怎样防治的办法。
    接着，老贫农计锦初把学生们带回教室，从“稻飞虱”联系到新旧社会的对比，对学生进行阶级教育。他说：二十八年前，我伲这里也发生过一场“稻飞虱”。那一年，我种地主十二亩地，受害六亩。那时候根本没有农药，我只好用稻草灰撒撒，但是稻草灰根本没有用，我急得在田边哭，结果六亩地颗粒不收。到年底，狠心的地主还是要照一石三的租米，收我十二亩地的租。我被逼得没有办法，只得出去逃荒讨饭。广大贫下中农都被弄得走投无路，有的甚至卖儿卖女。这时，黑心肠的地主又用收到的租米大放高利贷，残酷剥削我伲贫下中农。计锦初的血泪控诉，声声激起了听课学生对剥削阶级的刻骨仇恨。
    突然，老贫农计锦初眉头舒展开来，无比激动地说：今年这场“稻飞虱”比二十八年前那场要严重得多。但是，由于有毛主席的英明领导，发现“稻飞虱”后，公社革委会一方面立即动员群众去虫口夺粮，一方面连夜给各大队调配治虫药水，公社革委会成员和大队干部还深入田头，同贫下中农一起打药水，经过两三天的紧张战斗，“稻飞虱”就被扑灭了。今年我伲大队的产量不但不会减少，而且比历史最高年产的一九六六年还要高。老贫农计锦初越讲越有力，学生们越听越兴奋，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席、对新社会的无限热爱，齐声高呼：
  “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    这崭新的一课，引起了强烈的反响。许多贫下中农都称赞说：这一课上得好！许多学生高兴地说：这一课我们听得进、学得懂。那些原来感到没有办法的教师，也从这崭新的一课里尝到教学改革的甜头，深有体会地说：这一课不仅是活的农业知识课，而且是生动的阶级教育课，贫下中农把课上活了，真是有才能。
