The workers of Huainan Power Plant, under the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed at the plant, are filled with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm for the great leader Chairman Mao. They responded enthusiastically to the battle call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions. Despite heavy tasks, tight deadlines, and fewer people, they insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. They carried out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, fully demonstrating the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. They completed the overhaul of the unit 10 days ahead of schedule, a task originally planned to be completed in 30 days.

In early November this year, Huainan Power Plant received a task to overhaul unit 10. According to past standards, the overhaul was scheduled to take a month and required the participation of workers of at least the fourth grade. However, this time the deadline was tight, and many party members and old workers in the plant were attending party rectification and building classes, leaving mostly second and third-grade workers on the production line. Faced with the difficulties of fewer people, tight deadlines, and heavy tasks, the workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the working class having the farthest vision, being selfless, and being the most thorough in revolution" and "fully demonstrating the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work." They also discussed the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin on "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an endless force, becoming an invincible spiritual atomic bomb." They repeatedly discussed the great significance of this overhaul task. The workers proudly said, "No matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought, it will not be difficult." "We will definitely overcome all difficulties and complete the battle task given to us by Chairman Mao." They all pledged in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to complete the overhaul task in 10 days.

After the workers' awareness was raised, they bravely took on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. They set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere. Inside and outside the plant, before and after shifts, men and women, old and young, all participated, everyone took up the pen to join the battle. Everyone used the communiqué as a weapon to fiercely criticize and expose the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the plant who shamelessly advocated the "theory of the backwardness of the masses" and crazily promoted the "expert management" line. Worker Yang Shicheng and Wu Haijuan angrily denounced: "The great traitor, great spy, and great criminal Liu Shaoqi said that 'workers lack knowledge and cannot solve problems,' 'in production and technology, we must rely on experts.' The walking capitalists in our plant elevated the reactionary 'technical authorities' to the heavens, but they used various means of control, deduction, restriction, and suppression to tie our hands and feet, and strangle our socialist enthusiasm. Today, we will complete this overhaul ahead of schedule and let Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices see the true colors of the working class." The revolutionary criticism powerfully promoted the overhaul work. The workers poured all their revolutionary enthusiasm into the overhaul battle. They broke through the old frameworks and old regulations that shackled the workers, reformed unreasonable rules and regulations, broke down the boundaries of work teams and trades, and boldly organized second and third-grade workers, who could only do auxiliary work in the past, to important work positions. Due to the full play of the workers' creativity and enthusiasm, the overhaul work progressed rapidly.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Politics is the commander, the soul," "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Throughout the overhaul process, Huainan Power Plant always remembered this great teaching of Chairman Mao. No matter how busy the work was or how tight the time was, they always insisted on putting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works first, achieving learning before, during, and after shifts, and using what they learned. In the past, a small group of capitalist roaders in the plant maliciously said during the overhaul, "Make the bonus as much as possible, so that workers will be eager to work when they see it." They tried to lead workers astray with "material incentives" towards the capitalist road. While denouncing their crimes, the workers repeatedly shouted, "We want Mao Zedong Thought, not 'material incentives'." The workers pasted Chairman Mao's quotations all over the plant. They repeatedly studied and applied what they learned, always comparing themselves to the shining examples of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Loess Plateau, inspiring themselves, overcoming one difficulty after another, and achieving one victory after another.

Under the guidance of the communiqué, after a tense battle, the workers of Huainan Power Plant finally completed the overhaul ahead of schedule, creating the best speed and quality in the history of the plant's overhauls.

    在任务重、时间紧、人员少的情况下，怎么办？
    淮南发电厂工人坚持活学活用毛泽东思想
    深入地开展大批判推动检修工作胜利完成
    工人阶级发挥了领导作用，创造了建厂以来检修工作中最好的成绩
    本报讯　淮南发电厂工人阶级在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的热情帮助下，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的革命激情，以实际行动热烈响应党的八届十二中全会的战斗号召，在任务重、时间紧、人员少的情况下，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，深入持久地开展革命大批判，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，提前十三天完成原计划三十天完成的机组检修任务。
    今年十一月初，淮南发电厂接受了一项检修十号机组的任务。按照过去的标准，检修规定的时间是一个月，而且必须由四级工以上的工人参加。可是这次规定的时间紧，而且厂里的许多党员以及老工人参加整党建党学习班，留在生产岗位上的同志大多数是二、三级工。在人员少、时间紧、任务重的困难情况下，工人同志们反复学习了毛主席关于“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，以及林副主席关于“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹”的指示，反复讨论了这次检修任务的伟大意义，工人们豪迈地说：“千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难”，“我们一定能排除万难，完成毛主席交给我们的战斗任务。”他们纷纷在毛主席像前表示，保证十天完成检修任务。
    广大工人同志认识提高以后，勇敢地挑起了抓革命促生产的两副重担。他们到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。厂里批，厂外批，班前批，班后批，男女老少齐动手，个个挥笔上战场。大家以公报为武器，狠揭猛批了刘少奇及其在本厂的代理人无耻鼓吹“群众落后论”和疯狂推行“专家治厂”路线的滔天罪行。工人杨世臣和吴海元愤怒地控诉说：“大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇胡说什么‘工人没有知识，解决不了问题’、‘在生产技术上要依靠专家’，我们厂里的走资派把反动的技术‘权威’捧上了天，可是对我们工人阶级却百般地采用管、扣、卡、压等手段，束缚我们的手脚，扼杀我们的社会主义积极性。今天我们就要提前完成这项检修任务，让刘少奇和他的同伙们看看我们工人阶级的本色。”革命的大批判有力地推动着检修工作。广大工人把从革命大批判中激发出来的冲天革命干劲完全倾注到检修的战斗中去。他们破字当头，彻底砸烂了束缚工人手脚的旧框框和旧条条，改革不合理的规章制度，打破了班组界限和工种界限，大胆地把过去检修中只能做辅助工作的二、三级工组织到重要的工作岗位上。由于充分发挥了工人的创造性和积极性，检修工作进展很快。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，
  “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”淮南发电厂在整个检修过程中始终牢记毛主席这一伟大教导，不管工作如何忙、时间如何紧，始终坚持把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，做到班前学、班后学、班中用。过去厂里一小撮走资派在检修的时候，恶毒地说：“把奖金搞得多多的，使工人见了眼睛红红的，工人就肯干活了。”妄想用“物质刺激”把工人引向资本主义的邪路。工人们在痛斥他们的这些罪行的时候，一再高呼：“我们要毛泽东思想，不要‘物质刺激’。”工人们在厂房里贴满了毛主席语录。他们带着工作中的问题反复学反复用，处处以张思德、白求恩、老愚公的光辉形象来对照自己，鼓舞自己，克服了一个又一个的困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    在公报的光辉指引下，淮南发电厂的广大工人经过紧张战斗，终于提前完成了检修任务，创造了建厂以来历次检修工作中速度最快、质量最好的新成绩。
