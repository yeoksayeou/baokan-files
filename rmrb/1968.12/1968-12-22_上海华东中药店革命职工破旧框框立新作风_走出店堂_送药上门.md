Shanghai's Huadong Chinese Medicine Shop's revolutionary workers, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, severely criticized the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist management line in the commercial sector. They broke away from the long-standing practice of retail stores where "salespersons do not leave the shop" and old practices, stepping out of the shop to accompany medical personnel to go down to factories, shops, and alleys, actively delivering medicine to the doorstep. This was warmly welcomed by the worker masses and other laboring people.

The revolutionary workers of Huadong Chinese Medicine Shop saw that some revolutionary medical personnel carried their medicine boxes to go down to factories, shops, and alleys to serve, but patients who needed to take Chinese medicine still had to come to the medicine shop to get their prescriptions filled. This still affected the revolution and production. Therefore, they proposed: medicine and medical care are one family. Now that doctors go down to factories, medicine shop workers should follow the doctors to deliver medicine to the doorstep. However, some workers thought that patients coming to the shop and medicine shop workers filling prescriptions was a natural thing. The company's revolutionary committee, after understanding this situation, felt that this was a big issue concerning whether socialist commerce serves whom and provides convenience to whom, and it must be well resolved. Therefore, they organized the medicine shop's revolutionary workers to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, using Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune" as a weapon, to carry out a revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The revolutionary criticism raised everyone's class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, and everyone decided to change old thoughts and old practices, quickly shifting the standpoint to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and better serving industrial and agricultural production. They all expressed that they would rather work harder themselves, but let the patients recover their health as soon as possible, and better grasp the revolution and promote production. Immediately, they organized personnel, carrying medicine bags, following the method of revolutionary medical personnel going down to factories and shops, mainly focusing on nearby areas, cooperating with hospitals, actively coordinating with medical personnel to go to factory workshops and shops, actively accepting and filling prescriptions. They worked tirelessly, continuously improved their work, promptly accepted and delivered, ensuring that patients could take medicine immediately after seeing a doctor. After the salespersons went down to the factories, they better understood the conditions and medication of worker patients and added sixteen kinds of medicines such as opening the chest, smoothing the breath, stopping coughs, and dissolving phlegm to prevent diseases. For some new medicines, medical personnel were not familiar with, the salespersons actively introduced them.

    上海华东中药店革命职工破旧框框立新作风
    走出店堂　送药上门
    据新华社上海十七日电　上海市华东中药店革命职工遵照伟大领袖毛主席认真搞好斗、批、改的教导，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在商业部门推行的反革命修正主义经营路线，打破长期以来零售商店“营业员不出门”的旧框框和旧作风，走出店堂，配合医务人员下厂下店下里弄，主动送药上门，受到了工人群众和其他劳动人民的热烈欢迎。
    华东中药店革命职工看到有些革命医务人员背起药箱下厂下店下里弄服务后，需要服中药的病人仍然要跑到中药店来配药，这样还是影响抓革命促生产，因而提出：医、药是一家，现在医生下厂，药店职工应该随医上门送药。但是有的职工认为，病人上门，药店职工配药，这是当然的道理。公司革委会了解这一情况后，感到这是关系社会主义商业究竟为谁服务，给谁方便的大问题，必须很好加以解决。于是，就组织药店革命职工举办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席光辉著作《为人民服务》为武器，对刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线开展革命大批判。革命的大批判，提高了大家的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化，大家决心改变旧思想和旧作风，迅速地把立足点移到工农兵这方面来，更好地为工农业生产服务。他们纷纷表示，宁可自己多辛苦一点，也要让病人早日恢复健康，更好地抓革命促生产。于是，他们立即组织人员，背起药包，按照革命医务人员下厂下店的办法，以邻近地段为主，同医院互相协作，积极配合医务人员到工厂车间、商店，主动接方配药。他们不辞辛苦，不断改进工作，勤接快送，保证病员看病后马上就能服药。营业员下到工厂后，更好地了解了工人病员的病情和用药情况，还增加了开胸顺气、止嗽化痰等十六种药品，用来防治疾病。有些新药品，医务人员不了解，营业员就主动向他们介绍。
