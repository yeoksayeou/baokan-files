In the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in our province, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have resolutely carried out the various policies of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have achieved one great victory after another in the struggle against the enemy and on all other fronts. Through their struggle, they have deeply felt that the various policies of the Proletarian Headquarters are extremely wise and correct, possessing irresistible power. This has strengthened their sense of policy and raised their awareness of implementing policies. However, there are still some comrades who have a very weak sense of policy. In the current work of cleaning up class ranks, rectifying and building the Party, and other tasks, they do not pay attention to policy issues and have adopted some very simple and very detrimental methods to the struggle against the enemy. This is a problem that must be promptly brought to the attention of leaders at all levels and all revolutionary comrades in the current high tide of fully implementing and carrying out the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out profoundly: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party." "Now the enemy is completely isolated. But the isolation of the enemy does not mean our victory. If we make mistakes in policy, we still cannot achieve victory."

The policies of the Proletarian Headquarters are the proletarian policies of Chairman Mao, the concrete embodiment of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. They scientifically reflect the laws of class struggle and objective reality, and are the highest guiding principles for our victorious advance. The history of class struggle and current reality fully prove: if we act according to the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters, we can be invincible; conversely, if we go against the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters, our actions will deviate from the proletarian revolutionary track, will affect Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, will make mistakes, and may even go astray. Therefore, to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to speed up our steps, and to accomplish the various great fighting tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and to seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must resolutely and strictly implement the various policies of the Proletarian Headquarters.

In regard to the issue of implementing policies, there are some erroneous views:

	"As long as the general direction is correct, specific policies can be handled any way." This statement is wrong. The general direction is indeed a primary issue. If the general direction is wrong, everything is wrong. At any time, we must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead firmly at the handful of class enemies. However, the general direction is not abstract; it is embodied and formed by many local and specific actions. If, in local and specific actions, we do not act according to the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters and each does as he pleases, it will affect, interfere with, and even sabotage the general direction of the struggle, making it impossible to achieve the intended purpose. Therefore, it is wrong to separate grasping the general direction of the struggle from implementing specific policies.

	"Grasping and implementing policies is the responsibility of the higher-ups." This view is one-sided. Grasping and implementing policies is not only the responsibility of the higher-ups but also the responsibility of grassroots units and every revolutionary comrade. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any action of a revolutionary party is the implementation of policy. It is either the implementation of correct policy or the implementation of wrong policy; it is either the conscious implementation of some policy or the unconscious implementation of some policy." This is true for a party, a region, a unit, or a department. If the lower levels do not grasp and implement the Party's policies, the Party's policies cannot be carried out. Some people, precisely because they mistakenly believe that grasping and implementing policies is the responsibility of the higher-ups, do not pay attention to learning and implementing policies, and as a result, make mistakes.

	"Talking about policies will tie the hands of the masses." This view does not hold water. The basic point of the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters is to mobilize the masses, to firmly rely on the masses, and to seize victory. Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Before every action, we must explain to the Party members and the masses the policies we have formulated according to the situation." Giving policies to the masses and making the masses understand policies will enhance the masses' awareness and initiative in struggle, fully mobilizing the masses. The more than two years of the Cultural Revolution have fully proven this. Opposing talking about policies and mobilizing the masses is wrong.

The attitude towards the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters is a major issue of principle, a fundamental issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Resolutely implementing the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters is a characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary faction, a manifestation of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and a manifestation of upholding the Proletarian Headquarters, the sole leadership center of the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses; not implementing the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters and insisting on doing things differently is a manifestation of disloyalty to Chairman Mao, essentially creating a bourgeois "independent kingdom" and a bourgeois reactionary "multi-center theory."

To resolutely implement the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters, one must have a strong proletarian party spirit and always consider the overall interests of the proletariat. This requires us to use the invincible thought of Mao Zedong as a weapon, constantly "renewing" our minds, firmly establishing a proletarian worldview, strengthening the concept of the whole and revolutionary organizational discipline, and resolutely overcoming regionalism, sectarianism, localism, individualism, and liberalism. Those who, starting from the interests of their own region, unit, department, or organization, use the excuse of "special circumstances" and "adapting to local conditions" to not implement the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters, or who, towards phenomena that violate policies, adopt a liberalist attitude of "it's none of my business, I'll stay out of it; I know it's wrong, but I'll say less; I'll keep my head down and just avoid mistakes," lack proletarian party spirit and reflect a bourgeois worldview.

In the process of implementing the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters, we will inevitably encounter interference and sabotage from the class enemy from the right or the "left." We must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely smash the class enemy's plots to sabotage proletarian policies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic tasks of the leading organs of the Communist Party are to understand the situation and grasp policies in these two major areas." "To be good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, to be good at making every movement and every struggle not only understood by the leading cadres but also understood and grasped by the broad masses, this is an art of Marxist-Leninist leadership. Whether our work makes mistakes or not, the boundary is here."

Revolutionary committees at all levels and the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various units must seriously examine the situation of policy implementation in their own regions and units, strengthen the sense of policy, strengthen policy education among the masses, raise the awareness of policy implementation, turn the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters into the conscious actions of the masses, and promptly correct those who do not seriously implement the policies of the Proletarian Headquarters, who act arbitrarily and do things their own way.

Highly hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely and strictly implement the various policies of Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters, under the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters, unify thinking, unify steps, and unify actions, and strive forward to fully implement and carry out the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and to seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    坚决执行无产阶级司令部的政策
    《新安徽报》十一月二十四日社论
    编者按：此文写得不错，现予转载，以供参考。
    在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，我省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项政策，在对敌斗争和其它各条战线上，取得了一个又一个伟大的胜利。他们在斗争实践中，深切地体会到无产阶级司令部的各项政策，无比英明，无比正确，具有不可抗拒的威力，从而加强了政策观念，提高了执行政策的自觉性。但是，也还有少数同志，政策观念十分淡薄，在当前清理阶级队伍、整党建党和其它工作中，不注意政策问题，采取了一些十分简单、很不利于对敌斗争的作法。这是在当前全面贯彻落实党的八届十二中全会公报和认真搞好斗、批、改的高潮中，必须及时提请各级领导和一切革命同志加以注意的问题。
    伟大领袖毛主席深刻地指出：“政策和策略是党的生命”。“现在敌人已经彻底孤立了。但是，敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”
    无产阶级司令部的政策，是毛主席的无产阶级政策，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的具体体现，它代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，科学地反映了阶级斗争的规律和客观实际，是指引我们胜利前进的最高行动准则。阶级斗争的历史和现实充分证明：按照无产阶级司令部的政策办事，我们就能无往而不胜；反之，违背了无产阶级司令部的政策，我们的行动就会脱离无产阶级革命的轨道，就会影响毛主席的战略部署，就会犯错误，甚至走到邪路上去。因此，我们要坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，加快步伐，实现党的八届十二中全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就必须坚决地、严格地执行无产阶级司令部的各项政策。
    在对待执行政策问题上，有这样一些错误观点：
      “只要大方向正确，具体政策嘛，怎样搞都行。”这种说法是错误的。大方向固然是头等重要的问题，大方向错了，一切都错了。我们任何时候都要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人。但是，大方向不是抽象的，它是由很多局部和环节的行动来体现和形成的。在局部和环节的行动上，假若不按无产阶级司令部的政策办事，各行其是，就会影响、干扰甚至破坏斗争的大方向，使斗争不能达到预期的目的。因此，把掌握斗争大方向和执行具体政策割裂开来是不对的。
      “掌握、执行政策是上级的事。”这种说法很片面。掌握、执行政策不仅是上级的事，也是基层单位和每一个革命同志的事。毛主席教导我们：“一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。不是实行正确的政策，就是实行错误的政策；不是自觉地，就是盲目地实行某种政策。”一个政党是如此，一个地区、一个单位、一个部门，也是如此。假若下面不掌握、不执行党的政策，党的政策就不能落实。有些人正是由于错误地认为掌握、执行政策是上级的事，从而不注意学习、执行政策，结果犯了错误。
      “讲政策会束缚群众的手脚。”这种看法也站不住脚。无产阶级司令部政策的基本点，就是放手发动群众，坚决依靠群众，去夺取胜利。毛主席曾经指出：“在每一行动之前，必须向党员和群众讲明我们按情况规定的政策。”把政策交给群众，让群众懂得政策，就会提高群众斗争的自觉性、积极性，把群众充分发动起来。两年多来的文化大革命，充分证明了这一点。把讲政策和发动群众对立起来，是错误的。
    对无产阶级司令部的政策抱什么态度，是个大是大非问题，是对待毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的根本态度问题。坚决贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的政策，是无产阶级革命派的特质，是忠于毛主席的表现，是维护毛主席的无产阶级司令部这个全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心；不贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的政策，偏要另搞一套，是不忠于毛主席的表现，实质上是搞资产阶级的“独立王国”，搞资产阶级反动的“多中心论”。
    坚决贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的政策，必须有坚强的无产阶级党性，处处着眼无产阶级的全局利益。这就要求我们，要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，不断地在头脑里“吐故纳新”，牢固树立无产阶级的世界观，加强整体观念和革命的组织纪律性，坚决克服山头主义、宗派主义、本位主义、个人主义、自由主义。那种从本地区、本单位、本部门、本组织的利益出发，借口“情况特殊”、“因地制宜”，而不执行无产阶级司令部的政策，或者对违犯政策的现象，采取“事不关己，高高挂起；明知不对，少说为佳；明哲保身，但求无过”的自由主义态度，就是缺乏无产阶级党性，就是资产阶级世界观的一种反映。
    在执行无产阶级司令部的政策的过程中，必然会遇到阶级敌人从右的或“左”的方面干扰和破坏。我们务必加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕性，坚决粉碎阶级敌人破坏无产阶级政策的阴谋。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事”。“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”
    各级革命委员会和进驻各单位的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，要认真检查本地区、本单位执行政策的情况，加强政策观念，加强对群众的政策教育，提高执行政策的自觉性，把无产阶级司令部的政策变为群众的自觉行动，及时纠正那些不认真执行无产阶级司令部的政策，自以为是、另搞一套的作法。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决地、严格地执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的各项政策，在无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，为全面贯彻落实党的八届十二中全会公报，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利奋勇前进！
