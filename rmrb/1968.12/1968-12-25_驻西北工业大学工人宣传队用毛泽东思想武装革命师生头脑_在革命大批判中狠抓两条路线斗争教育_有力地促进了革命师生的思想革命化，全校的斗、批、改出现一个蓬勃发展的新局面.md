The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Northwest Industrial University has used Chairman Mao's latest directives as a guide to intensify education on the struggle between the two lines during the revolutionary criticism campaign. They have further armed the revolutionary teachers and students with Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, significantly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the revolutionary teachers and students. The entire school's struggle, criticism, and transformation have entered a new, flourishing phase.

Education on the struggle between the two lines is a core subject in the re-education of intellectuals

After the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered Northwest Industrial University, they found that most of the students were from worker and poor peasant families. These students had deep affection for the great leader Chairman Mao and had made significant contributions during the early and middle stages of the Cultural Revolution. However, due to the long-term promotion of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line by a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois intellectuals within the school, these students from worker and poor peasant families had been greatly harmed. Many of them held the ideas of prioritizing technology over politics, focusing on specialized skills, becoming experts, and believing that "knowledge is power." During the deepening of the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, some students were still focused on "ignoring the struggle between the two lines and concentrating on wireless circuits," while others even sought answers from some exposed bourgeois academic "authorities," appreciating their "knowledge." This hindered the deepening of the school's revolutionary criticism campaign.

Seeing this situation, the Worker Propaganda Team deeply felt that thoroughly eliminating the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and ensuring that students firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was a major issue in the struggle against the bourgeoisie for the younger generation. Therefore, they made education on the struggle between the two lines a core subject in the re-education of intellectuals and promoted the deepening of the revolutionary criticism campaign as an important means to raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They launched a wave of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines across the entire school.

The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team first guided the revolutionary teachers and students to connect the actual struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines within the school. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's discussions on the struggle between the two lines, igniting everyone's class hatred towards the number one capitalist roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents within the school. The revolutionary teachers and students reviewed the intense struggles between the two educational lines over the past decade, especially the heart-pounding battles on the educational front since 1958. They further recognized the reactionary nature of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. In 1958, the revolutionary teachers and students of this school, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. They carried out an educational revolution, driving some bourgeois academic "authorities" off their pedestals. However, due to the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's frenzied promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational lines such as "professors running the school" and "experts managing the school," within less than a year, a handful of capitalist roaders within the school apologized to some of the driven-off reactionary academic "authorities" in a school-wide meeting, reinstating them to their positions. One of the capitalist roaders even proposed the reactionary fallacy of "the party committee grinds the ink, and the professors paint," handing over the school's power to some reactionary academic "authorities," allowing them to "establish a famous university" and "erect a golden signboard." When discussing this struggle, the revolutionary teachers and students angrily said: In the past, due to the school's leadership being controlled by a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois intellectuals, they led the revolutionary teachers and students down the wrong path of detachment from reality, detachment from workers and peasants, and detachment from proletarian politics. The result of "the party committee grinds the ink, and the professors paint" could only be a shocking picture of capitalist restoration, a black signboard, and a black university. Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary teachers and students listed the evil conspiracies of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. They launched a face-to-face criticism and struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities." In the revolutionary criticism campaign, they studied the history of the struggle between the two lines and further deepened the revolutionary criticism campaign based on their studies, significantly raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They said: The historical experience of the struggle between the two lines proves that Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line is our lifeline, while Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line is our death line. We must firmly defend the lifeline of proletarian education and bury the death line of bourgeois education.

Arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental way to achieve ideological revolutionization

During the process of educating on the struggle between the two lines, the Worker Propaganda Team guided the revolutionary teachers and students to combine criticism with self-criticism, reflect on their thoughts, and examine themselves. They criticized revisionism in the struggle to transform their worldview and raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

In the past, some teachers and students believed that general ideological issues among teachers and students were not connected to the struggle between the two lines. Therefore, they often could not distinguish the major issues between the two lines. During the struggle, criticism, and transformation, some students simply emphasized the restoration of professional courses, seeking to "learn more knowledge." Some students even believed that in a science and engineering university, whether it was struggle or criticism, the ultimate goal was to master a specialized skill. The Worker Propaganda Team analyzed these active thoughts and believed that these wrong ideas among teachers and students were the remnants of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in people's minds. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings that "a new social system must be established on the basis of the old system, and it must clear away this basis. The remnants of old ideas that reflect the old system will remain in people's minds for a long time and will not easily retreat," they guided the revolutionary teachers and students to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in this school who promoted the reactionary fallacies of "grades first" and "intellectual education first." They exposed the reactionary nature of the so-called "good grades mean good politics; bad grades mean bad politics," aiming to make people bury their heads in books and ignore class struggles, allowing revisionist thoughts to spread and open the door to capitalism. In the revolutionary criticism campaign, the Worker Propaganda Team organized the revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander and the soul. They guided everyone to use the method of self-criticism, placing themselves in the struggle between the two lines, exposing their thoughts, discussing the harm, investigating the roots, eliminating the poison, and promoting ideological revolutionization. Some students, through their own process of "disliking bourgeois things in the first year, watching from the side in the second year, following in the third year, and changing drastically in the fourth year," denounced the harm of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line on themselves. Some students angrily said: In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders in this school, to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational lines such as "intellectual education first," on one hand, used methods such as "exams," "repeating grades," and "expulsion" to cruelly persecute students from worker and poor peasant backgrounds; on the other hand, they used sugar-coated bullets such as "prodigy," "engineer," and "thirty-yuan bonus" to corrupt and seduce young people to walk the bourgeois "red and expert" path. The revolutionary teachers and students angrily said: "Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line is an attempt to lead us down the wrong path and cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie. We must not be fooled." With excited hearts, they studied Chairman Mao's latest directives over and over, deeply realizing that the proletarian worldview is the ideological foundation for implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, while the bourgeois worldview is the ideological root for accepting and implementing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Only by raising the struggle against self and revisionism to the height of the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly transforming the worldview, can one consciously implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze typical cases is a good method for educating on the struggle between the two lines

To conduct a more extensive and in-depth education on the struggle between the two lines and make Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in the minds of the revolutionary teachers and students, the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team adopted the method of using typical cases to educate the general public, helping everyone raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They used Chairman Mao's latest directives as weapons to conduct an in-depth and detailed analysis of a student who was deeply poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, helping him wake up from the poison of revisionist thoughts. Then, they further used his personal experience of being poisoned and harmed to denounce and condemn Liu Shaoqi and his agents' promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, inspiring the revolutionary teachers and students to connect with their own thoughts, summarize the lessons learned from being poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and promote ideological revolutionization.

There was a student in the Department of Three Systems who came from a sailor worker family. On the first day of entering Northwest Industrial University, this pure-hearted youth wrote a page of enthusiastic diary in the "Five Good Worker" diary given by his father, expressing his eternal love for the party and Chairman Mao and his determination to follow Chairman Mao in the revolution. However, at that time, a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois academic "authorities" within the school vigorously promoted Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, spreading the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. They used reactionary fallacies such as "as long as you master a specialized skill, you will become famous and successful in the future" and "young people should study hard, and good grades mean being red" to seriously corrupt and poison the young students. They led this student down the wrong path of being "red but not expert," making him pursue "grades" and detach from politics, being regarded as a "prodigy" by the reactionary academic "authorities," encouraging him to work hard and further fostering his bourgeois fame and wealth thoughts.

The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, through multiple heart-to-heart talks, helped this student recognize the harm of the revisionist educational line on himself. In the school-wide meeting criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi, he angrily denounced the traitor Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of poisoning the youth and shared his painful lesson of being led astray due to the lack of awareness of the struggle between the two lines, educating everyone deeply. The revolutionary teachers and students saw a vivid example of the intense struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the younger generation, further raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They learned from this typical case, thought about themselves, fiercely criticized the "revisionist" character, struggled against their private thoughts, truly touched their souls, and deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They strengthened their profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to break with the old bourgeois thoughts and ideas.

Currently, through the education on the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary teachers and students of Northwest Industrial University have a completely new spiritual appearance. The entire school's struggle, criticism, and transformation have entered a new, flourishing phase.

    驻西北工业大学工人宣传队用毛泽东思想武装革命师生头脑
    在革命大批判中狠抓两条路线斗争教育
    有力地促进了革命师生的思想革命化，全校的斗、批、改出现一个蓬勃发展的新局面
    本报讯　驻西北工业大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队，以毛主席的一系列最新指示为指针，在革命大批判中狠抓两条路线斗争的教育，进一步用毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的学说武装广大革命师生的头脑，有力地促进了革命师生的思想革命化，全校斗、批、改出现了新高潮。
    两条路线斗争的教育是对知识分子再教育的一门主课
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻西北工业大学以后，发现这个学校的绝大部分学生都是工人和贫下中农子弟，他们对伟大领袖毛主席有深厚的感情，在文化大革命初期和中期建立过许多功绩。但是，由于学校里的一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子长期推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，使这些工人和贫下中农子弟受到很大毒害。许多人存在着重技术、轻政治，“学专长，当专家”，“唯有读书高”的思想。在学校斗、批、改深入发展的时候，有的人却“两耳不闻路线斗争，一心只搞无线电线路”，有的学生甚至向一些被揪出来的资产阶级反动学术“权威”问“数据”，求“答疑”，欣赏他们的“知识”，学校的革命大批判深入不下去。
    看到这种情况，工人宣传队深深感到彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒，让学生坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，这是同资产阶级争夺青年一代的大问题。于是，他们把两条路线斗争的教育作为对知识分子再教育的一门主课，把深入开展革命大批判作为提高两条路线斗争觉悟的重要途径，在全校掀起了学习两条路线斗争史的热潮。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队首先引导革命师生联系本校两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，认真学习毛主席关于两条路线斗争的论述，激发大家对党内头号走资派刘少奇及其在本校的代理人的阶级仇恨。广大革命师生回顾了十几年来本校两条教育路线的激烈搏斗，特别是回顾了一九五八年以来，教育战线上进行的一场场惊心动魄的斗争，进一步认清了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的反动本质。一九五八年，这个学校的广大革命师生，在毛主席的教育革命的光辉思想指引下，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，大搞教育革命，把一些资产阶级反动学术“权威”赶下了台。但是，由于大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇疯狂推行“教授治校”“专家办学”等反革命修正主义教育路线，结果不到一年，这个学校的一小撮走资派就在全校大会上给一些被赶下台的反动学术“权威”“平反”、“赔礼”、“道歉”，把他们重新扶上了台。学校的一个走资派甚至还提出什么“党委磨墨，教授画画”的反动谬论，把学校的大权交到一些反动学术“权威”的手里，让他们“办名牌大学”“立金字牌匾”。革命师生们在谈到这场斗争的时候，愤怒地说：过去，由于学校的领导权被一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子所把持，把广大革命师生引上了脱离实际、脱离工农、脱离无产阶级政治的邪路。“党委磨墨，教授画画”的结果，只能为“立黑字牌匾”“办黑字大学”画出一幅触目惊心的资本主义复辟的大黑画。广大革命师生通过两条路线斗争史的学习，历数刘少奇及其代理人疯狂推行反革命修正主义教育路线的罪恶阴谋，向一小撮走资派和反动学术“权威”展开了面对面的批判斗争。他们在革命大批判中学习两条路线斗争的历史，又在学习的基础上深入开展革命大批判，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。他们说：两条路线斗争的历史经验证明，毛主席的无产阶级教育路线是我们的生命线，刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线是我们的死亡线。我们一定要坚决捍卫无产阶级教育的生命线，彻底埋葬资产阶级教育的死亡线。
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑是搞好思想革命化的根本
    在进行两条路线斗争教育的过程中，工人宣传队引导革命师生把大批判和小整风结合起来，联系思想，对照检查，在批判修正主义的斗争中努力改造世界观，提高两条路线斗争觉悟。
    过去，有些师生总是认为，师生中的一般思想问题和两条路线斗争联系不起来。因此，常常划不清两条路线中的大是大非的界限。在斗、批、改中，有些学生单纯强调恢复专业课，追求“多学一点知识”，有的学生甚至认为，在理工科大学里，斗也好，批也好，归根到底还是要学好一门专长。工人宣传队抓住这些活思想进行了分析，认为师生中这些错误想法，正是刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线在人们思想上的流毒。他们根据毛主席关于“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的”的伟大教导，引导广大革命师生，狠揭猛批刘少奇及其在这个学校的代理人宣扬的“分数挂帅”、“智育第一”等反动谬论，揭穿所谓“功课好，政治自然好；功课不好，政治也不会好”的反动本质，就是要人们埋头读书，对阶级斗争不闻不问，让修正主义思想泛滥，为资本主义大开方便之门。在革命大批判中，工人宣传队组织革命师生反复地学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂等一系列教导，引导大家采取小整风的方法，把自己摆到两条路线斗争中去，亮思想，论危害，查根源，肃流毒，促进思想革命化。有的学生通过自己对一些资产阶级的东西“一年级看不惯，二年级旁边看，三年级跟着干，四年级大变样”的变化过程，控诉了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害。有的学生愤怒地说：过去这个学校的一小撮走资派为了推行“智育第一”等反革命修正主义教育路线，一方面用“统考”、“留级”、“退学”等手段残酷迫害工人和贫下中农出身的学生；一方面又用“神童”、“工程师”、“三十元奖金”等糖衣炮弹腐蚀引诱青年走资产阶级“白专”道路。革命师生们愤怒地说：“刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，就是妄图把我们拉到邪路上去，培养成资产阶级的接班人，我们绝不能上当。”他们怀着激动的心情一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的最新指示，深刻地认识到，无产阶级世界观是执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的思想基础，资产阶级世界观是接受和执行刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的思想根源。只有把斗私和批修提高到两条路线斗争的高度，彻底改造世界观，才能自觉地执行毛主席的革命路线。
    用毛泽东思想剖析典型进行两条路线斗争教育的好方法
    为了更广泛、更深入地进行两条路线斗争的教育，使毛主席的革命路线在广大革命师生的头脑里深深扎根，工人毛泽东思想宣传队采取了运用典型，教育一般的方法，帮助大家提高两条路线斗争觉悟。他们以毛主席的一系列最新指示为武器，对一位受刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线毒害较深的学生，进行深入细致的剖析，帮助他从修正主义思想毒害下醒悟过来，然后进一步以他中毒受害的切身经历，控诉、声讨刘少奇及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，启发广大革命师生联系自己的思想，总结受反革命修正主义教育路线毒害的教训，促进思想革命化。
    三系有一个学生，出身于一个海员工人家庭。刚进西北工业大学的第一天，这个纯朴的青年，在父亲给他的五好工人日记本上，写下了一页热情的日记，表示“要象葵花向太阳”一样，永远热爱党和毛主席，永远跟着毛主席干革命。但是，当时学校里的一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，竭力推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，大肆宣扬封、资、修黑货。用“只要学好一门专长，将来就会成名成家”、“青年人要刻苦读书，学习成绩好就是红”等反动谬论严重地腐蚀、毒害青年学生，把这个学生拉上了“只专不红”的邪路，使他把当“工程师”作为“奋斗目标”，严重脱离政治，一味追求“分数”，被反动学术“权威”视为“得意门生”，鼓励他好好干，进一步助长他的资产阶级名利思想。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队通过多次谈心，帮助这个学生认识了修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，在全校革命师生批判大叛徒刘少奇的大会上，他愤怒地控诉了大叛徒刘少奇毒害青年的滔天罪行，讲述了自己由于缺乏路线斗争觉悟被他们引上歧途的沉痛教训，使大家受到了一次深刻的教育。广大革命师生从这个活生生的典型身上，清楚地看到了一场资产阶级同无产阶级争夺青年一代的激烈斗争，更加提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。他们看典型，想自己，狠批“修”字，狠斗私心，真正触到了灵魂深处，更加加深了对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的理解，加强了对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，表示要和资产阶级的旧思想、旧观念彻底决裂。
    目前，经过两条路线斗争的教育，西北工业大学广大革命师生的精神面貌焕然一新，全校的斗、批、改出现了一个蓬勃发展的新局面。
