We suggest that urban public primary schools be converted into community-run primary schools.

The specific method is: transfer the primary schools originally under the direct leadership of the districts to the alleys and neighborhoods, and have the neighborhoods collaborate to run them. Retired workers, revolutionary parents, and revolutionary teachers should work together to manage them. The principal of the school should be one of the leaders of the alley revolutionary committee. Teachers in the school should go to the countryside, to the border areas, and to where the motherland needs them the most to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. Teachers who remain in the school should also be sent down to labor for two to three years in batches. If there is a shortage of teachers, workers with at least six years of work experience, high class consciousness, and some education should be selected from the factories to serve as teachers.

    街道、里弄负责办小学
    我们建议把城市的公办小学改为民办小学。
    具体办法是：把原来由区直接领导的公办小学放到里弄、街道，街道联合起来办，由退休老工人、革命家长、革命教师配合着一起管理。小学的校长应当是里弄革命委员会负责人之一。学校里的教师应当到农村去、到边疆去、到祖国最需要的地方去，接受贫下中农的再教育。留校教师也应当分期分批下放劳动二至三年。如果教师缺少，应当从工厂中挑选工龄至少六年的阶级觉悟高的有文化的工人担任教师。
