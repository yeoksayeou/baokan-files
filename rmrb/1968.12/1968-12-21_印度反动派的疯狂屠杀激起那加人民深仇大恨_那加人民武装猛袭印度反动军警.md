The armed forces of the Naga people, undaunted by the armed suppression of the Indian reactionary government, have seized the opportunity to fight bravely and repeatedly strike the enemy over the past few months.

On December 12, in the Denupal district of the Manipur Central Administrative Region in eastern India, Naga armed forces attacked a squad of Indian reactionary police, killing four armed policemen and wounding six, seizing all their weapons and ammunition.

In early September this year, Naga armed forces ambushed and killed three Indian officers, including a captain. In mid-October, Naga armed forces equipped with automatic weapons launched a fierce attack on Indian military patrols in Tungam, Manipur. On October 23, in a nearby area, Naga armed forces again struck the Indian reactionary police forces.

Indian Army Chief of Staff Kumaramanagram rushed to the Naga state capital, Kohima, on November 7 to deploy strengthened armed suppression actions. It is reported that in mid-November, the Indian reactionary government mobilized a large number of troops from the military center of Assam to the Naga state. The Indian reactionary government also attempted to sabotage the unity of the Naga people, even provoking armed conflicts within, in a vain attempt to extinguish the flames of the Naga people's armed struggle.

The Naga people harbor deep hatred for the Indian reactionaries. For many years, Indian reactionary soldiers and police have carried out mad slaughter of the Naga people, forcing many Nagas to take up arms and enter the forests to defend themselves. Now, the Naga people are strengthening their coordination with the Mizo, Kuki, and other ethnic groups, and gradually uniting with revolutionary peasant groups in eastern India who are rising up against the Indian reactionary authorities and feudal landlords. They are expanding the scale of their armed struggle and striking the Indian reactionaries with even greater force.

    印度反动派的疯狂屠杀激起那加人民深仇大恨
    那加人民武装猛袭印度反动军警
    新华社十七日讯　新德里消息：那加人民的武装力量不怕印度反动政府的武装镇压，几个月来，把握战机，英勇战斗，一再打击敌人。
    十二日，在印度东部曼尼普尔中央直属领地的登努帕尔区，那加武装力量袭击了一队印度反动警察，打死武装警察四名，打伤六名，缴获了全部武器和弹药。
    今年九月初，那加人民武装伏击并且打死了三名印度军官，其中包括一名上尉。十月中，使用自动武器的那加武装力量在曼尼普尔的吞加姆向印军巡逻部队猛烈开火。十月二十三日，在这个地方附近，那加武装力量再次打击了印度反动警察部队。
    印度陆军参谋长库马拉曼加拉姆十一月七日慌忙跑到那加邦首府科希马，部署加强武装镇压行动。据透露，在十一月中旬，印度反动政府从阿萨姆邦的军事中心调动大批军队到那加邦去。印度反动政府还极力破坏那加人民的团结，甚至挑动他们内部的武装冲突，妄想借此扑灭那加人民武装斗争的火焰。
    那加人民对印度反动派怀有深仇大恨。多年来，印度反动军警疯狂屠杀那加人民，迫使许多那加人走入森林，拿起武器进行自卫。现在，那加人民同米佐、库基等族人民加强配合，并且逐步同印度东部地区起来反抗印度反动当局和封建地主的革命农民团结起来，扩大武装斗争的规模，更有力地打击印度反动派。
