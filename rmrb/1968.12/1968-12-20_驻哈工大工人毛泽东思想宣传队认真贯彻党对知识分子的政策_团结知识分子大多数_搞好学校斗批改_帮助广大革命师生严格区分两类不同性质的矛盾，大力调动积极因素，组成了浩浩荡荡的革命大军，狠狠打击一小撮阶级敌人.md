The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at Harbin Institute of Technology is seriously implementing the Party's proletarian policies on intellectuals, vigorously promoting positive factors, relying on the activists in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, uniting the majority of intellectuals, and forming a mighty revolutionary army. This has powerfully promoted the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Implementing the Party's Proletarian Policies on Intellectuals to the Masses

Harbin Institute of Technology is a science and engineering university with nearly half a century of history. The revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents has deeply influenced the school, making the class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and the struggle between two roads extremely sharp and intense. After the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered Harbin Institute of Technology, they faced a complex class struggle situation. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on policies towards intellectuals, realizing that strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions and correctly implementing the Party's proletarian policies on intellectuals is an important part of the proletarian political leadership of the workers over the school. It is also a guarantee for organizing a mighty army for struggle, criticism, and transformation, and for firmly striking down a handful of class enemies.

The workers' propaganda team immediately launched a large-scale campaign across the entire school to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals and the important editorial note "Nine·Five" in the *Red Flag* magazine. At the same time, they organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes centered on implementing the Party's policies on intellectuals, handing over the Party's policies to the masses. As a result, the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of intellectuals was greatly inspired. They are determined, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to seriously accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to thoroughly change their old ideas, and to actively and enthusiastically throw themselves into the fiery struggle of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Relying on the Proletarian Revolutionaries in the School Who Are Determined to Carry the Cultural Revolution Through to the End, and Raising the Awareness of Activists in Mastering Policies

In leading the teachers and students of the school to carry out the proletarian educational revolution, the workers' propaganda team firmly relies on the proletarian revolutionaries in the school who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. They pay great attention to discovering and cultivating activists during the struggle, fully utilizing their role, and turning the Party's policies into the conscious actions of the masses through them. To raise the policy level of activists, the workers' propaganda team organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes for activists, raising their awareness of mastering policies. The workers' propaganda team also selected a batch of activists who had been tested in the struggle from among the students and placed them in the most intense class struggle units within the school, under the leadership of the workers' propaganda team, to participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation there, and to be tempered and tested in the storms of class struggle. This batch of activists, taking the workers' propaganda team as an example, enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's various proletarian policies in various units, playing a leading role everywhere, uniting the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff, and powerfully promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Mobilizing All Positive Factors to Organize a Mighty Revolutionary Army

The workers' propaganda team stationed at the school pays great attention to using the Party's proletarian policies to mobilize all positive factors in the school, organizing a mighty revolutionary army, and continuously deepening the struggle, criticism, and transformation. There are some revolutionary youngsters who made some mistakes in the Cultural Revolution and carried the burden of ideological baggage. The workers' propaganda team went deep into the classrooms and dormitories, bringing Chairman Mao's proletarian policies to their hearts, and enthusiastically carried out heart-to-heart talks with them, helping them to raise their consciousness, summarize their experiences and lessons, and revive their revolutionary spirit to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. There was a student who made some mistakes in the Cultural Revolution, was mentally troubled, and later was hospitalized due to illness. The propaganda team members went to the hospital to visit him, enthusiastically introducing the school's good situation to him, propagating the Party's policies, and encouraging him to achieve new merits in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. The student was moved to tears, saying excitedly, "The workers' propaganda team sent by Chairman Mao is closer to me than my own family! I will definitely humbly accept the leadership of the working class and do a good job in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation."

The workers' propaganda team also, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also needs to liberate all of humanity. If it cannot liberate all of humanity, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately achieve liberation." They educated everyone to use the one-divides-into-two approach to correctly view the merits and demerits of the youngsters who made some mistakes in the Cultural Revolution. In this way, the youngsters who made mistakes and the broad revolutionary teachers and students quickly strengthened their unity and enthusiastically threw themselves into the torrent of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The workers' propaganda team paid great attention to helping revolutionary teachers and students correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, strictly distinguishing between those rightist elements who are anti-Party and anti-socialism and those who support the Party and socialism but have also made some mistakes; strictly distinguishing between bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" and those who have general bourgeois academic ideas. They, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Mobilize all positive factors, unite all those who can be united, and as far as possible turn negative factors into positive factors, serving the great cause of building a socialist society." They used Mao Zedong Thought to unify understanding, unify steps, and unify actions.

At present, under the leadership of the workers' propaganda team, Harbin Institute of Technology has organized a mighty revolutionary army. The school-wide revolutionary criticism is burning more fiercely, the work of cleaning up the class ranks is deepening step by step, a handful of class enemies are more isolated than ever, and the entire campus presents a thriving revolutionary scene.

    驻哈工大工人毛泽东思想宣传队认真贯彻党对知识分子的政策
    团结知识分子大多数  搞好学校斗批改
    帮助广大革命师生严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，大力调动积极因素，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人
    新华社哈尔滨十九日电　驻哈尔滨工业大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队，认真贯彻党对知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，大力发扬积极因素，依靠学校中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，团结知识分子的大多数，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，有力地促进了学校的斗、批、改。
    把党对知识分子的各项无产阶级政策交给群众
    哈尔滨工业大学是有近半个世纪历史的理工科大学。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行的修正主义教育路线的流毒在这里影响很深，学校内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争非常尖锐、激烈。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进入哈工大以后，面对着复杂的阶级斗争情况，反复学习了毛主席有关对知识分子政策的一系列教导，认识到，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确贯彻党对知识分子的各项政策，是工人阶级对学校实行无产阶级政治领导的一个重要内容，是组织浩浩荡荡的斗、批、改大军，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的保证。工人宣传队立即在全校掀起了一个声势浩大的学习毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示和《红旗》杂志“九·五”重要编者按的热潮，同时举办了以落实党对知识分子的政策为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，把党的政策交给群众。这样做的结果，广大知识分子革命精神大振，决心在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，认真接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，并且积极热情地投身到了斗、批、改的火热斗争中。
      坚决依靠学校中决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，提高积极分子掌握政策的自觉性
    工人宣传队在领导学校师生进行无产阶级教育革命中，坚决依靠学校中决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。他们十分注意在斗争中发现和培养积极分子，充分发挥他们的作用，通过他们把党的政策变为群众自觉的行动。为了提高积极分子的政策水平，工人宣传队为积极分子举办了毛泽东思想学习班，提高积极分子掌握政策的自觉性。工人宣传队还从学生中选拔出一批经过斗争考验的积极分子，把他们放到校内阶级斗争最激烈的“老大难”单位，在工人宣传队的领导下参加那里的斗、批、改，在阶级斗争的风浪里经受考验和锻炼，这批积极分子以工人宣传队为榜样，在各单位热情宣传毛泽东思想和党的各项无产阶级政策，处处起骨干带头作用，团结了广大师生员工，有力地推动了斗、批、改的开展。
    调动一切积极因素，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军
    驻校工人宣传队十分注意用党的无产阶级政策来调动学校中的一切积极因素，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把斗、批、改不断引向深入。有一些革命小将，在文化大革命中犯了一些错误，背上了思想包袱。工人宣传队就深入教学班、宿舍，把毛主席的无产阶级政策送到他们的心坎上，并且热情地和他们广泛开展谈心活动，帮助他们提高认识，总结经验教训，振奋起革命精神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。有一个学生在文化大革命中犯了些错误，思想苦闷，后来因病住了医院。宣传队员就到医院去看望他，热情地给他介绍学校的大好形势，宣传党的方针政策，鼓励他在学校斗、批、改中立新功。这个学生被感动得流下了热泪，他激动地说：“毛主席派来的工人宣传队，比我的亲人还亲！我一定虚心接受工人阶级的领导，把学校的斗、批、改搞好。”
    工人宣传队还和广大革命师生一起学习毛主席的教导：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放”，教育大家用一分为二的观点，正确对待犯了一些错误的小将在文化大革命中的功与过。这样，犯错误的小将和广大革命师生很快加强了团结，一起斗志昂扬地投身到斗、批、改的洪流中。
    工人宣传队非常注意帮助革命师生正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，把那些反党反社会主义的右派分子，同拥护党和社会主义，但也犯了一些错误的人严格区别开来；把资产阶级反动学术“权威”，同具有一般的资产阶级学术思想的人，严格区别开来。他们和广大革命师生一起，反复学习了毛主席“调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为建设社会主义社会这个伟大的事业服务”的教导，用毛泽东思想来统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。
    目前，在工人宣传队的领导下，哈工大组织起了一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军。全校革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，清理阶级队伍的工作步步深入，一小撮阶级敌人空前孤立，整个校园呈现一派蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。
