During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary staff of the Zi Hong Restaurant in Qixian County, Shanxi, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticized and repudiated the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the number one capitalist roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They carried out a series of revolutionary changes in the direction, ideology, and style of management, making the restaurant present a brand-new revolutionary appearance.

The Zi Hong Restaurant is located at the foot of a mountain, thirty li southeast of Qixian County, adjacent to the Bai Jin Highway from Taiyuan to Changzhi. This restaurant, with only thirteen staff members, serves thousands of travelers every day. All travelers who have been to this restaurant praise it as a "propaganda station" for Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a "distribution center" for Chairman Mao's works, a good battlefield for carrying out revolutionary criticism, and a large classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers also highly praise the restaurant's inexpensive and high-quality mass-style dishes and the enthusiastic and considerate service.

Highlighting proletarian politics, turning the restaurant into a propaganda station for Mao Zedong Thought

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important question. We must focus on the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought."

The revolutionary staff of the Zi Hong Restaurant not only insist on reading Chairman Mao's books every day, constantly engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, and carrying out the "three loyalties" activities of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but also regard propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most sacred duty and the fundamental way to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, the first thing they did when opening the restaurant was to greet customers to come in and eat. Now, the first thing they do is to wish the great leader Chairman Mao long live together with the customers. In the past, the restaurant only sold food, cigarettes, and alcohol. Now, the restaurant distributes portraits of Chairman Mao and his revolutionary books. In the past, the walls were covered with posters promoting feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. Now, everywhere are quotations from Chairman Mao. In the past, customers chatted while waiting for their food. Now, while waiting, the staff guide them to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and draw nourishment from Chairman Mao's works. The current Zi Hong Restaurant highlights Mao Zedong Thought in everything.

Every time Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the staff of the restaurant act immediately, study them seriously, and propagate them widely. They write down the latest instructions and use them in blackboard newspapers and broadcast them through loudspeakers to spread them among the people, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are conveyed without delay. They have organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams multiple times, carrying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and revolutionary books, climbing mountains and crossing valleys to propagate Chairman Mao's great voice to villages like Baosi Ridge and Yong'an Fort, which are seven or eight li away. They distribute revolutionary books to poor and lower-middle peasants, who are moved and say: "In the past, the restaurant sold fried dough twists and pancakes and talked about business. Now, you bring Chairman Mao's books and talk about Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must study them well and work hard for the revolution!"

After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary staff of the restaurant studied it repeatedly and organized propaganda teams to perform artistic programs in the villages at night. They also used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a guide, combined with the actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the local area, and used cartoons and poems to severely criticize the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "six black essays." They held class education exhibitions and, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, held joint struggle meetings multiple times, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and striking a heavy blow to the enemies of the class. The travelers said: "The Zi Hong Restaurant is indeed a large classroom for class education and a good battlefield for carrying out revolutionary criticism!"

Continuously raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, firmly serving the broad masses of workers and peasants

In the process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly," the revolutionary leading group of this restaurant specially organized the staff to have bitter meals and hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study classes, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, who advocated "profit first" and "material incentives," and their awareness of the struggle between the two lines was greatly enhanced. Everyone deeply realized: We are running a restaurant for the revolution. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, adhere to the socialist direction, and better serve proletarian politics and the broad masses of workers and peasants.

From then on, the revolutionary staff of the Zi Hong Restaurant took serving the workers and peasants as their main direction for struggle, criticism, and transformation. They humbly listened to the opinions of the masses and always thought of the workers and peasants. At the suggestion of the revolutionary staff, they canceled the two-yuan "portion meals" and seriously prepared mass-style meals, increasing the variety of dishes from the original ten to twenty-one. There are dishes like seven-fen per bowl of clear noodle soup, three-fen per dish of stir-fried cabbage, two jiao per pound of jujube cake, one jiao per bowl of tofu soup, with many varieties, low prices, sufficient quantities, and high quality. Customers can eat well for just a few jiao. To convenience the travelers, they opened the business at six in the morning. Sometimes, when there were too many guests, the staff voluntarily gave up their beds to let the guests rest. The thirteen staff members, from the leaders to the service staff, all worked from early morning to late night, serving thousands of travelers, enduring hardships and fatigue to provide convenience for the travelers.

In the practice of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the revolutionary staff of the Zi Hong Restaurant deeply felt: If the struggle between the two lines is not clear, the direction will not be clear; if the "self" is not overcome, the direction will be difficult to maintain. The struggle between the two lines must be talked about frequently and repeatedly, learned in the struggle, and political awareness must be continuously improved. Only in this way can one have a clear mind, strong will, and firm determination, and be able to carry out continuous and thorough revolution, firmly walking the socialist road of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, serving the people as a steward for life

The revolutionary staff of the Zi Hong Restaurant have a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and grasp the use of studying Mao Zedong Thought. They remember Chairman Mao's great teachings: "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life and not do bad deeds," and work diligently and earnestly, determined to be stewards of the people for life.

This spring, with the continuous increase in business, the restaurant's facilities became insufficient. The revolutionary staff repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and decided to learn from the people of Dazhai, be self-reliant, and strive for strength. They used their spare time to fill pits with soil, build houses, and in more than a month, built a warehouse and a toilet, not only saving the country's expenses but also fostering a new trend of "thrift for revolution."

They remember Chairman Mao's great teachings: "All members of revolutionary teams must care for, love, and help each other." They leave difficulties for themselves and convenience for others. On one day in July, a mountain flood cut off the highway bridge, and cars could not pass, leaving travelers without water or food for several hours. Facing this situation, they took bread and carried hot water, waded through the water, and helped the travelers solve their difficulties. On one evening in September, a female traveler with four children was exhausted in front of the restaurant. It turned out that she was a poor peasant from Pingding County, going to Changzhi to visit relatives, and due to encountering rain in Taigu, her travel expenses were used up, and she had to walk. After the restaurant's leaders understood the situation, they immediately mobilized the staff to carry out the spirit of class love, helping her solve the problems of eating and accommodation, and the next day, they explained the situation to passing drivers, helping the family of five to get on the car. Many travelers praised: "In the past, the relationship between the restaurant and customers was like oil and water, recognizing money but not people; now, the relationship between the restaurant and customers is like fish and water, with mutual affection."

The staff of the Zi Hong Restaurant always demand of themselves with the spirit of "selflessly serving others." They urgently address the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, think about what the workers, peasants, and soldiers think about, and help the workers, peasants, and soldiers with what they need. A staff member of the restaurant found a driver's wallet containing more than fifty yuan while cleaning the room. He immediately handed it over to the manager, and when the driver returned, it was returned to him in full. The driver expressed his thanks, and they said: "We are class brothers and should care for each other. If you want to thank someone, you should thank the great leader Chairman Mao!"

    一个深受工农兵喜爱的新型饭店
    ——记山西祁县子洪饭店在文化大革命中的变化
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，山西祁县子洪饭店的革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大破党内头号走资派刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在经营方向、经营思想、经营作风上进行一系列的革命，使饭店出现了崭新的革命面貌。
    子洪饭店位于祁县城东南三十里的山脚下，紧傍从太原到长治的白晋公路。这个仅有十三名职工的饭店，每天要接待上千名旅客。凡是到过这个饭店的旅客，都称赞这个饭店是毛主席最新指示的“宣传站”，是毛主席著作的“发行所”，是开展革命大批判的好战场，是学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。广大工农兵群众对于这里价廉物美的大众化饭菜，热情周到的服务态度，也赞不绝口。
    突出无产阶级政治把饭店办成毛泽东思想宣传站
    林彪副主席指出：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”
    子洪饭店的革命职工，不但自己坚持天天读毛主席的书，不断斗私批修，开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，而且把宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想当作自己最神圣的职责和为工农兵服务的根本。过去，他们开门头件事是招呼顾客进店吃饭，现在，开门第一件事是和顾客共同敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆；过去饭店只卖饭菜、烟酒，现在饭店发行毛主席像和毛主席的革命宝书；过去墙上贴的是宣扬封、资、修的招贴画，现在处处是毛主席语录；过去顾客等饭时，谈天说地，现在等饭时服务员引导他们学习毛主席的最新指示，从毛主席著作中汲取营养。现在的子洪饭店，时时、事事突出毛泽东思想。
    每当毛主席最新指示发表后，饭店职工便闻风而动，认真学习，广泛宣传。他们把记录下来的最新指示，写成黑板报，利用广播筒，向群众进行传播，做到了传达毛主席的最新指示不过夜。他们多次组织起毛泽东思想宣传队，带着毛主席的最新指示，带着毛主席的革命宝书，爬山越岭，到七八里以外的白寺岭、永安寨等山庄，宣传毛主席的伟大声音，把革命宝书送给贫下中农，贫下中农感动地说：“过去饭店卖的是麻花、饼子，讲的是生意经，现在，你们带的是毛主席的书，讲的是毛主席的最新指示，俺们一定要好好学习，为革命种好田！”
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，饭店革命职工学了又学，议了又议，迅速组织起宣传队，连夜赶排文艺节目，深入山村宣传。他们还以毛主席最新指示为指针，联系本地区阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实际，运用漫画、诗歌等形式，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇鼓吹的黑“六论”，举办阶级教育展览。他们和广大工农兵旅客一起，多次联合召开批斗大会，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。旅客们说：子洪饭店真是进行阶级教育的大课堂，开展革命大批判的好战场啊！
    不断提高两条路线斗争的觉悟坚定地为广大工农兵服务
    在全面落实毛主席的“认真搞好斗、批、改”这一最新指示的过程中，这个饭店的革命领导小组，专门组织职工们吃忆苦饭，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了党内头号走资派刘少奇所鼓吹的“利润第一”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义谬论，两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高。大家深刻地认识到：我们是为革命而开饭店的。一定要用毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持社会主义方向，更好地为无产阶级政治服务，为广大的工农兵群众服务。
    从此以后，子洪饭店的革命职工就把怎样为工农兵服务当做他们斗、批、改的主攻方向。他们虚心听取群众的意见，处处为工农兵着想。在革命职工的提议下，他们取消了两元钱的“份儿饭”，认真搞好大众饭菜，把饭菜由原来的十种花样，增加成二十一种，有七分钱一碗的清汤面，三分钱一碟的炒白菜，二角钱一斤的枣糕，一角钱一碗的豆腐汤，品种多，价格低，数量足，质量高。顾客只花几角钱，就能吃饱吃好。为了方便旅客，他们把营业时间提前到早上六点开门。有时住客太多，容纳不下，职工们主动把自己的床位腾出来，让客人们歇息。他们十三个人，从领导到服务员，大家都每天起早搭黑，接待着成千个旅客，宁肯自己受苦受累，也要为旅客提供方便。
    在斗、批、改的斗争实践中，子洪饭店的革命职工深切地体会到：两条路线分不清，方向就不明；“私”字斗不倒，方向就难保。对两条路线斗争，就是要经常讲，反复讲，在斗争中学，不断提高政治觉悟，这样才能有清醒的头脑，旺盛的斗志，坚强的决心，才能不断革命，彻底革命，坚定地走为工农兵服务的社会主义道路。
    无限忠于毛主席当一辈子人民的勤务员
    子洪饭店革命职工，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对学习毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字。他们牢记毛主席“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事”的伟大教导，勤勤恳恳，踏踏实实，决心当一辈子人民的勤务员。
    今年春天，随着业务的不断增加，饭店设备显得不足。革命职工反复学习毛主席的光辉著作《愚公移山》，决心以大寨人为榜样，自力更生，奋发图强。他们利用业余时间，拉土填土坑，修房盖屋，一个多月盖起库房一间，修建厕所一个，不仅给国家节约了开支，而且养成了“节约闹革命”的新风尚。
    他们牢记毛主席“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的伟大教导，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人。今年七月的一天，山洪暴发，冲断公路桥梁，汽车过不来，旅客几个小时喝不上水，吃不上饭。面对这种情况，他们拿上饼子，担着开水，涉水而过，帮助旅客解决困难。今年九月一个傍晚，饭店门前有一个带着四个孩子的女旅客，劳累不堪。原来她是平定县的一个贫农，到长治探亲，因在太谷遇雨停留，路费已经花完，不得已改为步行。饭店领导同志问清情况后，立即发动职工发扬阶级友爱精神，帮助她解决吃饭住宿问题，第二天又向过路司机说明情况，帮助这一家五口人搭上了汽车。许多旅店赞扬说：“过去饭店和顾客是油水关系，认钱不认人；现在饭店和顾客是鱼水关系，互相心贴心。”
    子洪饭店的职工时刻以“毫不利己专门利人”的精神来要求自己。他们急工农兵之所急，想工农兵之所想，帮工农兵之所需。饭店一个职工打扫房间时，发现一位司机丢掉一个钱包，内有人民币五十多元，他立即交给保管，当司机返回时如数交还，司机表示感谢，他们说：“咱们是阶级兄弟，应当互相关心，要谢的话，你应当感谢伟大领袖毛主席！”
