In Rome, over 5,000 students from various schools held a massive demonstration on the 20th to protest the government's suppression of the masses' movement and to oppose the Italian government's recent push for a deceptive "education reform" plan.

Students gathered at the Piazza Venezia in the city center and then marched through the streets of Rome.

At the front of the march was a long banner that read: "No to Capitalist Education Reform!" The demonstrators sang the "Internationale" and waved many red flags and placards.

Some of the placards read: "Workers and students unite to fight!" "Students, unite to resist the bosses' reforms through the bourgeois state (machine)!" "We do not accept anything imposed by the state (machine) that we do not recognize!"

During the march, students angrily shouted, "Remember Avola!" (Avola is a village in Sicily where Italian police recently shot two striking agricultural workers). As they passed the residence of the newly appointed Italian Prime Minister, they shouted, "Down with the bosses' government!"

The Italian government dispatched a large number of police to brutally suppress the demonstrating students, injuring many and arbitrarily arresting over 20 students. The students, enraged, picked up stones and sticks to defend themselves and bravely fought back against the reactionary police.

In Assisi, Umbria, students from the "St. Paul" Catholic University held demonstrations for three consecutive days.

All middle school students in the city went on strike to support the university students' struggle. After occupying the "St. Paul" University, students also occupied the city hall, train station, bus station, post office, and telephone exchange to express their anger and protest.

In Viareggio, Tuscany, all middle school students went on strike and held demonstrations on the 20th to protest police suppression of the student movement and to demand democratic rights. They also went to the industrial zone near the city's port to meet with local industrial workers and dockers.

In Turin, a major city in northern Italy, 300 medical students occupied a hospital on the 19th and held a rally with patients, medical staff, and some doctors. The reactionary authorities sent a large number of police to suppress the crowd, but they were repelled.

For several days, students have continued to occupy four specialized hospitals attached to the university.

In cities such as Pavia, Treviglio, Bama, Salerno, and Benevento, students also went on strike, demonstrated, and occupied school buildings.

The wave of workers' strikes in Italy is also continuing to rise. Over 70,000 employees of department stores across the country went on strike on the 21st and 22nd to demand wage increases. This strike greatly annoyed capitalists who were eager to make a profit before "Christmas," forcing them to order managers and accountants to replace the employees at the counters.

On the 19th, 120,000 textile workers in Italy went on strike to demand higher wages and full employment.

Gas station workers in Italy also went on a nationwide strike on the 19th and 20th.

Workers of the Italian airline company also went on strike on the 20th, causing the airline to cancel 27 international flights and 24 domestic flights.

In the Catania region of southern Italy's Sicily, thousands of agricultural and industrial workers went on strike to oppose the ruthless exploitation by the monopoly bourgeoisie and to defend their rights.

In Padua, northeastern Italy, striking workers and students on strike supported each other and fought side by side, repelling the attack of a large number of police sent to suppress them.

The mass movement in Italy is becoming increasingly widespread and intense. (Photo attached)

    “不要资本主义的教育改革”　“工人学生团结起来进行斗争”
    意大利革命群众运动猛烈向前发展
    罗马等地大中学生示威同反动警察英勇搏斗
    十二万纺织工人和全国七万店员举行大罢工
    新华社二十二日讯  罗马消息：意大利学生和工人反对垄断资产阶级残酷的压迫和剥削的斗争浪潮，继续席卷意大利全国各地。
    在意大利首都罗马，五千多名大、中学校的学生二十日举行了声势浩大的示威游行，抗议政府镇压群众运动，反对意大利政府最近大力兜售的骗人的所谓“教育改革”计划。
    学生们在市中心的威尼斯广场集合后，列队在罗马市中心举行了游行示威。
    在游行队伍的前面是一条很长的横幅，上面写着：“不要资本主义的教育改革！”示威者高唱《国际歌》，高举着许多红旗和标语牌。
    有些标语牌上写着：“学生和工人团结起来进行斗争！”“学生们联合起来，反对老板们通过资产阶级国家（机器）搞的改革！”“不接受我们所不承认的国家（机器）规定的任何事情！”
    学生们在游行时愤怒地高呼：“牢记阿沃拉！”（阿沃拉是西西里岛上的一个村庄，意大利警察最近在那里枪杀了两名罢工的农业工人）学生们在走过新上任的意大利总理的住宅时高呼；“不要老板的政府！”
    意大利政府派出大批警察对示威的学生进行了野蛮的镇压，打伤了许多示威者，并无理逮捕了二十多名学生。学生们十分愤怒，拿起石块和棍棒进行自卫，同反动警察英勇地进行了搏斗。
    在乌姆布利亚区的阿西西，“圣保罗”天主教大学的学生连续举行了三天的示威。
    全市中学生为了声援大学生的斗争，举行了总罢课。学生们在占领“圣保罗”大学以后，连日来还占领了市政厅、火车站、公共汽车站、邮政局和电话局，向当局表示愤怒的抗议。
    在托斯卡纳区的维亚雷焦，全市中学生二十日举行了总罢课和示威游行，抗议警察镇压学生运动和要求民主权利。他们还走到这个城市码头附近的工业区，同当地的产业工人和码头工人会见。
    在意大利北部的大城市都灵，三百名医科学生十九日占领了一所医院，同病人、卫生员和一些医生共同举行了集会。反动当局派出大批警察闯入医院镇压群众，遭到群众的反击。
    几天以来，学生们一直坚持占领大学附设的四个专科医院。
    在帕维亚、特雷维利奥、巴马、萨勒诺、本尼凡托等城市，学生们也进行了罢课、示威和占领校舍的斗争。
    意大利工人罢工的浪潮也在继续高涨。意大利各地百货公司的七万多店员，二十一日和二十二日举行了全国性的罢工，要求增加工资。这次罢工使得渴望在“圣诞节”前的倾销中大捞一把的资本家十分恼火，迫得他们下令让经理和会计代替店员去站柜台卖货。
    意大利十二万纺织工人十九日举行了罢工，要求提高工资和充分就业。
    意大利汽车加油站的工人十九日和二十日也举行了全国范围的罢工。
    意大利航空公司的工人二十日也举行了罢工，使得这个航空公司不得不取消了它的二十七次国际班机的飞行和二十四次国内班机的飞行。
    在意大利南部西西里岛上的卡塔尼亚区，数千名农业和产业工人也为了反对垄断资产阶级的残酷剥削，维护切身的权利而举行了罢工。
    在意大利东北部的帕多瓦，罢工的工人和罢课的学生互相支援，并肩战斗，击退了前来镇压的大批警察的进攻。
    意大利的群众运动正在越来越广泛、越来越猛烈地向前发展。（附图片）
