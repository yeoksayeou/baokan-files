Life is full of contradictions and struggles. The most frequent, most important, and most prominent struggle within the Party is the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there are no contradictions and no ideological struggles to resolve them, the life of the Party would cease." Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of our Party. Our Party has developed and consolidated itself through struggles against the bourgeois reactionary line. From the day it was born, there has always been a struggle between the correct proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and various erroneous bourgeois reactionary lines. Our Party has experienced struggles against the rightist or "leftist" erroneous lines of Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, and Wang Ming, and especially against the bourgeois reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi. The struggle between the two lines is extremely fierce and sharp, a struggle to the death. Because our Party acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions and implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, it has achieved great victories in every struggle. These facts show that the struggle between the two lines is constant, never ceasing, and always present in the Party's life and construction. Each struggle of our Party has been a process of "renewal," tempering the broad masses of Party members and cadres, enhancing their ability to distinguish right from wrong, friend from foe, and truth from falsehood. Especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Party has undergone the severe test of the struggle between the two lines. Through revolutionary criticism, class struggle, and rectification, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated among the masses. The awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad masses of Party members and cadres has reached an unprecedented height. By removing the dross and sweeping away the rubbish, our Party has become purer, stronger, and more vigorous. This fundamentally enhances the Party's ability to fight against the class enemy and strengthens the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, not understanding the struggle between the lines means not understanding class struggle. Without awareness of the struggle between the lines, one cannot see the political situation clearly, cannot determine policies, cannot judge right from wrong or distinguish friends from enemies, and cannot better serve the people. Why did some Party members stand on the wrong side during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and commit various errors? There are countless reasons, but the fundamental one is that they did not study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well, did not adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and did not constantly and repeatedly use Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as a yardstick to measure, correct, and guide their words and deeds.

"Historical experience is worth noting." This is Chairman Mao's earnest instruction. The struggle between the two lines within the Party has always been centered around the issue of power. Forgetting the struggle between the two lines is forgetting power, forgetting the revolution, forgetting the life of the Party, and losing the essence. This is the greatest fool! If so, the conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi to restore capitalism will succeed, and the tragedy of the Soviet Union will be repeated in China.

Every time there is a fierce struggle between the two lines, the Party advances a step. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines reached its peak. The "February Countercurrent" and the evil wind this spring to reverse the verdict on the "February Countercurrent" are attempts to reverse the verdict on Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, to interfere with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from the right, to deny the necessity and great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to direct the spearhead at the proletarian headquarters. We have smashed this countercurrent, deepened our understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and deepened our understanding of the struggle between the two lines. This is another great victory of the Party in the struggle between the two lines!

The struggle between the lines permeates everything. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions:

"Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be known to the broad revolutionary masses." The struggle between the lines should be discussed every day, every month, every year, and every generation. The strings of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines must be kept taut at every moment, constantly and repeatedly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using the history of the struggle between the two lines to educate ourselves and the masses. Relying closely on the broad revolutionary masses to carry out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Firmly establish the viewpoint of class struggle, raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, carry the struggle between the two lines through to the end, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    把两条路线斗争进行到底
    八○六六部队　黄定聪　欧光安
    生活就是矛盾，生活就是斗争。党内斗争最经常、最主要、最突出的就是两条路线斗争。毛主席教导我们：“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们党的生命线，我们党就是在同资产阶级反动路线作斗争中发展和巩固起来的。她从诞生那天起，就一直存在着以毛主席为代表的正确的无产阶级革命路线同各种错误的资产阶级反动路线的斗争。我们党经历了同陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明的右的或“左”的错误路线的斗争，特别是同以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线作了反复的长期的斗争。两条路线斗争是非常激烈、非常尖锐的，是你死我活的。由于我们党按照毛主席指示办事，贯彻执行了毛主席的革命路线，在历次斗争中，都取得了伟大的胜利。这些事实表明，两条路线的斗争是经常发生的，从来没有停顿，始终贯串于党的生活和党的建设中。我们党的每次斗争，都进行了一次“吐故纳新”，锻炼了广大党员和党的干部，使他们增强了辨别是非、辨别敌我、辨别真假的能力。特别在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们党经受了两条路线斗争的严峻考验，经过革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党，毛泽东思想在广大群众中大普及，广大党员和党的干部的两条路线斗争觉悟，达到了前所未有的高度。清除了废料，扫掉了一批垃圾，我们的党更加纯洁，更加坚强，更加朝气蓬勃。这就从根本上提高了党对于阶级敌人进行战斗的本领，强化了无产阶级专政。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，不懂得路线斗争，就不懂得阶级斗争。没有路线斗争觉悟，就看不清政治形势，就决定不了政策，就不能判断是非、分清敌我友，就不能更好地为人民服务。为什么有些党员在无产阶级文化大革命中站错了队，犯了这样或那样的错误？原因有千条万条，但最根本的一条，就是没有很好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持毛主席的革命路线，没有能经常地、反复地用毛主席的革命路线这根标尺衡量、校正、指挥自己的言行。
    “历史的经验值得注意。”这是毛主席的谆谆教导。党内的两条路线斗争，始终是围绕着政权问题进行的。忘记了两条路线斗争，就是忘掉了政权，忘掉了革命，就是忘掉了党的生命，丢掉了根本。这是最大的糊涂虫！如果这样，中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇复辟资本主义的阴谋就会得逞，苏联的悲剧就会在中国重演。
    每经过一次两条路线斗争的激烈搏斗，党就前进一步。在无产阶级文化大革命中，两条路线斗争达到了高峰。“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风，为刘少奇资产阶级反动路线翻案，从右的方面干扰毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，否认无产阶级文化大革命的必要性和所取得的伟大胜利，矛头指向无产阶级司令部。我们击溃了这股逆流，更加深了对毛主席革命路线的理解，更加深了对两条路线斗争的认识。这是党在两条路线斗争中的又一个伟大胜利！
    路线斗争贯串一切。我们一定要遵照毛主席的最新指示：
  “历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”路线斗争要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，代代讲，一分一秒都要绷紧阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的弦，经常地、反复地活学活用毛主席著作，用两条路线斗争的历史教育自己，教育群众。紧紧依靠广大革命人民群众进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。把阶级斗争观点扎得牢牢的，把两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，把两条路线的斗争进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！（原载《青海日报》本报有删改）
