The people and the People's Liberation Army soldiers on the frontline of sea defense in Fujian, numbering 17 million, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be frequently and repeatedly talked about. It is not enough to talk to a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." They have launched a mass movement to deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines, further arming their minds with Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and principles regarding the continuation of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the support and help of the soldiers, the broad revolutionary masses are pushing the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts to a new high tide.

In the mass movement to deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad military and civilian personnel on the frontline of Fujian fully utilize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi as a negative teacher, further deepening the revolutionary criticism. A rally to denounce the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, attended by 200,000 military and civilian personnel, was held in the provincial capital Fuzhou. In Nanping Prefecture, 2 million military and civilian personnel held an unprecedented large-scale rally to denounce Liu Shaoqi in the prefecture seat of Nanping City and in 12 counties, more than 100 communes (towns), and several hundred production brigades. In the revolutionary base areas of Changting and the ethnic minority areas of Fuding County, the military and civilian personnel held more than 1,000 joint criticism meetings against Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes in just a few days. Now, the mass movement to criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes is developing on an unprecedented scale.

The revolutionary workers of Fujian Province, who have ascended to the political stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure, enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and deeply criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The revolutionary workers of the Xiamen Engineering Machinery Factory angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Fujian, such as Ye Jianying, who used this factory as a black test point to promote the "Peach Garden Experience" during the Four Clean-ups movement, shamelessly shielding demons and monsters, suppressing the politics of the working class, opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, and advocating material incentives. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in cities such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Nanping unanimously agreed during their study and discussions that the struggle, criticism, and transformation currently taking place in the superstructure domain is a continuation of the struggle between the two lines. It must be recognized as a way to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent capitalist restoration. It is essential to follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line without deviation and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

Chairman Mao said, "Only socialism can save China." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Fujian Province, in conjunction with the actual struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside, deeply carry out the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines. The more they study, the deeper their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They believe that the journey of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants advancing along the socialist path over the past 19 years is a journey of following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and defeating the repeated ferocious counterattacks of Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist roaders.

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals participating in labor in the countryside of Fujian, through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, further realize the profound correctness of Chairman Mao's teaching: "A large number of cadres going down to labor is an excellent opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches."

The soldiers of the army, navy, and air force on the frontline of Fujian, who guard the frontline day and night and fight on the frontline of the "three supports and two militaries," recalling the glorious history of the brave People's Liberation Army following Chairman Mao's lead in fighting south and north, defeating both armed and unarmed enemies, all deeply feel: historical experience tells us that following Chairman Mao is victory! Our line is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; the viewpoint we must uphold is the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought viewpoint on class and class struggle, on the continuation of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This line, we must follow it without deviation, to the end; this viewpoint, we must never forget, and engrave it in our hearts. The broad soldiers express their determination to forever be the fighting force defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    福建海防前线军民认真学习两条路线斗争史
    紧跟毛主席革命路线乘胜前进
    守卫在海防前线的三军指战员坚决表示：永远做捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗队，永远做无产阶级专政的坚强柱石
    据新华社福州十一日电　福建海防前线一千七百万革命人民和人民解放军指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，坚决贯彻毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，掀起了一个深入学习两条路线斗争史的群众运动，进一步用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策武装自己的头脑。广大革命群众在解放军指战员们的支持、帮助下，正把各条战线的斗、批、改推向一个新的高潮。
    福建前线广大军民在深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，充分利用叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇这个反面教员，更加深入地开展革命大批判。在省会福州市举行了二十万军民参加的声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的大会。南平专区的二百万军民，在专区所在地南平市和十二个县、一百多个公社（镇）、几百个生产大队，在同一个日子里举行了空前规模的声讨刘少奇大会。革命老根据地长汀、少数民族聚居的福鼎县等地的军民，在短短几天里就召开了一千多场对刘少奇反革命罪行的联合批判会。现在，对刘少奇反革命罪行的革命大批判的群众运动，正以空前的规模向前发展。
    登上上层建筑斗批改政治舞台的福建省广大革命工人，热烈歌颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，深揭狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。厦门工程机械厂的革命工人们，怒火万丈地控诉了刘少奇及其在福建的代理人叶飞之流在四清运动期间，把这个工厂当作推销“桃园经验”的黑试点，大肆包庇牛鬼蛇神，专工人阶级的政，反对突出无产阶级政治，大搞物质刺激的滔天罪行。福州、厦门、漳州、泉州、南平等城市的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在学习、座谈中一致认为：今天上层建筑领域正在进行的斗、批、改，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，就是两条路线斗争的继续，一定要把它提到巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的高度来认识，一定要寸步不离地紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席说，“只有社会主义能够救中国。”福建省广大贫下中农结合农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争实际，深入展开两条路线斗争史的学习。他们越学，对毛主席的最新指示理解得越深。他们认为，解放十九年来广大贫下中农沿着社会主义大道前进的历程，就是紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，击退刘少奇等一小撮走资派一次又一次猖狂反扑的战斗历程。
    正在福建农村参加劳动的革命干部和革命知识分子，通过学习两条路线斗争史，进一步认识到毛主席关于“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动”的教导，无比英明正确。
    日夜守卫在海防前哨、战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的福建前线陆、海、空三军的指战员，回顾了英勇的人民解放军紧跟毛主席南征北战，打败了拿枪的敌人和不拿枪的敌人的光辉历程，都深有感触地说：历史的经验告诉我们，紧跟毛主席就是胜利！我们的路线，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；我们要坚持的观点，就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的观点。这个路线，我们要寸步不离，一走到底；这种观点，我们要时刻不忘，铭刻心头。广大指战员表示要永远做捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战斗队，永远做无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。
