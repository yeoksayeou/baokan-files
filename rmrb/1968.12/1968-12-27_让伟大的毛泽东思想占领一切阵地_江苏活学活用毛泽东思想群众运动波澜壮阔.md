The mass movement to study and apply the thought of Mao Zedong in Jiangsu province has reached a new and magnificent stage as the struggle between the two lines in history deepens. The broad revolutionary masses are studying to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and they are using it to prevent capitalist restoration and build socialism. The invincible thought of Mao Zedong has taken deep root in the minds of the people, occupying all positions, and powerfully promoting the rapid development of the struggle-criticize-transform movement and industrial and agricultural production on all fronts.

As soon as the latest directive from the great leader Chairman Mao, "The experience of history is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be constantly lectured, repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," was issued, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu province sprang into action with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, propagating it to the broad revolutionary masses and leading them to quickly launch the study movement on the struggle between the two lines in history. The broad revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao even more and have a deeper understanding that mastering the thought of Mao Zedong is the fundamental way to raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Therefore, they are more conscious than ever before in studying and applying the thought of Mao Zedong, making the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong thought reach a new breadth and depth.

Now, the vast urban and rural areas of Jiangsu have universally established "red lines" for transmitting Chairman Mao's latest directives. Tens of thousands of propagandists of Mao Zedong thought frequently go deep into every field and corner to propagate Mao Zedong thought. Every latest directive from Chairman Mao and every battle order from the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are promptly disseminated without obstruction. Once Chairman Mao's latest directive is issued, many counties and communes generally make it known to every household and individual within two or three hours.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power." The broad revolutionary masses in Jiangsu, centering on the struggle between the two lines, repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, constantly strengthen their consciousness of the proletarian state power, and raise the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong thought to a new height. The students of the "May 7th" cadre school in Jiangning County, through studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, further realize that the center of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines is the question of state power. They say, the proletariat has everything with state power; without state power, it has nothing. To keep the proletarian state power, it is necessary to raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They vow to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, defend the ironclad mountains and rivers of the proletarian dictatorship, and keep them red for generations to come.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." In the new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong thought, the broad revolutionary masses in Jiangsu, from the height of the struggle between the two lines, realize the importance of breaking private interests and establishing public interests in the mind. As soon as the "private" character of the bourgeoisie shows its head, they grasp it and fight it fiercely, insisting on using Mao Zedong thought to direct all actions and speed up the realization of ideological revolutionization. In the past period, the sixth production team of Shangbang Brigade in Huangdian Commune, Wuxian County, could not evaluate work points due to some members having private interests, resulting in work points not being evaluated since the summer harvest and summer planting. In this movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, everyone studied and applied Mao Zedong thought, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, broke private interests and established public interests, and greatly raised the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. As a result, it only took two hours to evaluate the work points for the entire team for five months.

The broad revolutionary masses in Jiangsu consciously use Mao Zedong thought to direct the struggle-criticize-transform movement, greatly accelerating the process of struggle-criticize-transform on all fronts. In the past, workers in Nanjing Puzhen Vehicle Factory had to go through five checks, six approvals, seven reviews, and eight examinations for a technological innovation, often ending up in vain. Now, "three-in-one" technological innovation small groups have been established at all levels, with workers as the main body and revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel participating. Many technological innovation projects with international and domestic advanced levels have been realized, and production has risen in a straight line, completing this year's production task 40 days ahead of schedule.

    让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地
    江苏活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动波澜壮阔
    毛泽东思想深深扎根于群众之中，推动各条战线斗批改和工农业生产迅猛发展
    据新华社南京二十六日电　随着两条路线斗争史学习运动的深入开展，江苏省活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动出现了一个波澜壮阔的新局面。广大革命群众为捍卫毛主席的革命路线、巩固无产阶级专政而学，为防止资本主义复辟、建设社会主义而用。战无不胜的毛泽东思想在人们头脑里深深扎下根子，占领一切阵地，有力地推动了各条战线的斗、批、改和工农业生产的迅猛发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示一发表，江苏省各级革命委员会闻风而动，以最大的热情，最快的速度，向广大革命群众宣讲，领导群众迅速开展了两条路线斗争史的学习运动。广大革命群众更加热爱毛主席，更加深刻地认识到，掌握毛泽东思想，是提高两条路线斗争觉悟的根本。因此，他们比以往任何时候都更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想的大普及，达到了新的广度和深度。
    现在，江苏广大城乡已经普遍建立了传达毛主席最新指示的“红色线路”。数以万计的毛泽东思想宣传员，经常深入各个领域每个角落宣传毛泽东思想。毛主席的每一项最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都能及时传播，畅通无阻。毛主席的最新指示一发表，许多县和公社一般只要两三个小时就能家喻户晓，人人皆知。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”江苏广大革命群众围绕着两条路线的斗争，反复学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，不断增强无产阶级政权观念，把活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动提到了新的高度。江宁县“五·七”干校的学员通过学习两条路线斗争史，进一步认识到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的中心，是政权问题。他们说，无产阶级有了政权，就有了一切；没有政权，就没有一切。要保住无产阶级政权，就必须把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟提得高高的。他们表示一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保卫无产阶级专政的铁打江山，千秋万代永不变色。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。江苏省广大革命群众在活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动新高潮中，从两条路线斗争的高度，认识到在头脑中破私立公的重要。资产阶级“私”字一露头，他们就抓住狠狠斗，坚持用毛泽东思想指挥一切行动，加速实现思想革命化。吴县黄埭公社上浜大队第六生产队前个时期在实行大寨式评分中，由于部分社员有私心，评不下去，以致从夏收夏种以来，工分一直没有评。在这次两条路线斗争史学习运动中，大家活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，破私立公，两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，结果只用了两个小时，就把全队五个月的工分评好了。
    江苏广大革命群众自觉地用毛泽东思想统帅斗、批、改，大大加快了各条战线斗、批、改的进程。南京浦镇车辆厂，过去工人搞一项技术革新，要过五关，闯六卡，七审八批，转了一大圈，往往石沉大海，杳无音讯。现在层层建立了以工人为主体、有革命干部和革命技术人员参加的“三结合”技术革新小组，实现了许多具有国际、国内先进水平的技术革新项目，生产直线上升，提前四十天完成了今年生产任务。
