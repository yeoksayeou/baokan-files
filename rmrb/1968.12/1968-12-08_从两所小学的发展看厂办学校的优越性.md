The primary school of the Yantai Machine Tool Accessory Factory is a factory-run school. The Dongfanghong Primary School is a public school directly under the old Yantai Prefectural Committee. Both schools were established in 1960 and had around 300 students each, one on the south side of the mountain and the other on the north side. Over the past eight years, the two schools have taken two distinctly different paths.

**For Whom to Educate**

The primary school of the Machine Tool Accessory Factory, upon its establishment, was immediately subjected to the impact of the revisionist educational line. The old education bureau's capitalist roaders tried every means to crush it. However, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory gave it strong support and helped build the school. Under the care and support of the broad masses of workers, this school grew stronger day by day. They ran the school according to the wishes of the working class, admitting new students without regard to age, time, or physical condition. Older students could bring their younger siblings to school, and the school would help take care of them. The school also regularly sought opinions from the workers and reported on its work. The workers said, "Factory-run schools are good; they truly serve the working class."

The Dongfanghong Primary School, on the other hand, implemented Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line. Initially, the children of cadre officials and workers and peasants attended the same school. Later, they found the children of workers and peasants "unsanitary" and "savage," so they built separate school buildings and established a separate school for the children of the prefectural committee officials. They had a "three noes" policy for admitting students: no children of workers, no children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and no children of military personnel. Nearby poor and lower-middle peasant children had no right to attend the school and had to go far to study. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "This school is not on our path."

**How to Run the School**

The Machine Tool Accessory Factory School followed Chairman Mao's educational policy, taking the path of "political construction of the school" and "thrifty management." It established courses such as "Study Chairman Mao's Works," "Class Education," "Revolutionary Tradition Education," and "Labor Education." They frequently invited old workers to give speeches on bitter memories and sweet memories, talk about revolutionary traditions, and hold class education exhibitions. This cultivated the students' deep proletarian feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao, and instilled in them from a young age the concepts of class struggle and line struggle. Students went to the factory for labor every week, participated in various political movements within the factory, and were encouraged to learn from the working class, care about state affairs, and imbue themselves with the working class's ideological imprint from a young age. The school's equipment was made from local materials and made do with what was available. Teachers and students worked together to repair the playground and build ping-pong tables. In the early days of the school's establishment, wooden planks were used as desks and bricks as stools. Later, old workers collected a batch of old desks and stools from the workshop and repaired them for use.

The Dongfanghong Primary School was a different situation. The old education bureau's capitalist roaders regarded courses such as "Study Chairman Mao's Works," "Class Education," "Revolutionary Tradition Education," and "Labor Education" as "invented topics" and as "pouring a bucket of water on students," "destroying students' souls." Therefore, they did not allow these courses. Instead, they made "Selected Ancient Poems," self-compiled retro "Three Character Classics" compulsory courses. They listed "sharpening pencils" and "cutting nails" as labor courses, euphemistically called "cultivating civilized habits." Students were divided into "Secretary Classes" and "Director Classes" (classes for the children of secretaries and directors), giving them special treatment. Teaching methods included "memorize, write, read," and "big exams," and other complicated revisionist educational methods, which had a significant impact on students' physical and mental health. Once, a big exam lasted a week, and the student sickness rate reached 25%. The school's expenses were directly allocated by the education bureau, spending money lavishly. For example, they spent over 300 yuan to buy a high-end radio to learn standard Mandarin. They bought pianos, accordions, and harmonicas if they had them. Just the general expenses of the school (not including equipment) for each student per year amounted to 36.9 yuan, which was double that of the factory-run school.

**Cultivating What Kind of Successors**

Chairman Mao said, "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." The Machine Tool Accessory Factory School better embodied Chairman Mao's educational policy, cultivating students who had deep feelings for workers and peasants, loved labor, had strong class struggle and collective consciousness. Because of their contact with workers and participation in factory political activities, their class consciousness was relatively high, and many acts of selflessness, saving others, and fighting against class enemies emerged. Students organized their own haircutting group, carried manure baskets during breaks, dug toilets, did sanitation work, and participated in factory labor eagerly. In winter, students lit their own stoves. Many students realized: Without Chairman Mao, there would be no happiness today. When they grow up, they must serve the people well, and do whatever the Party asks. Teachers, influenced by the education and influence of the working class, also underwent significant changes in their ideological appearance.

The Dongfanghong Primary School implemented the bourgeois educational line of "intellectual education first" and "grades as the criterion," spreading the fallacy of "reading books to become officials." Some students openly said they wanted to "become big officials, earn more money, use the phone, sit on sofas, and warm themselves with heaters" when they grew up. Some students had a serious sense of hierarchy in their souls, often arguing about whose parents had a higher rank. In life, they emphasized bourgeois "civilized habits," considered themselves superior, and looked down on everything. Some students complained about the school's toilets being bad and ran home to use the toilet after class. They were picky about food and clothing, afraid of dirt and hard work, and did not know how to farm. Revolutionary masses angrily said, "This school is a revisionist 'experimental field'!" In such an environment, some teachers from poor and lower-middle peasant families were influenced by bourgeois ideology, and their feelings for workers and peasants gradually faded.

**The Working Class Must Control Urban Education**

From the above stark contrast between the two primary schools, one can fully see the superiority of factory-run schools.

Our country is a proletarian dictatorship, and the working class must lead everything. We must use the proletarian worldview and Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate the next generation. Therefore, urban primary and secondary schools must be run by factories and led by the working class.

The advantages of running schools this way are:

1. The working class truly grasps the power of education, realizing proletarian dictatorship in the superstructure, including in various cultural fields. From the root, it ends the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools.

2. It is beneficial for the re-education of intellectuals. In factory-run schools, teachers are not only teachers but also workers and students of the working class. They work together with workers in the three great revolutionary movements, which can best promote the transformation of teachers' worldviews, achieve ideological revolutionization, and thoroughly change the past situation of being seriously detached from reality, gradually narrowing the gap between mental and physical labor.

3. It truly implements Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive." From the root, it changes the evil tendency of the bourgeoisie cultivating students who are detached from politics, detached from reality, and detached from the masses, turning it into the proletarian education of combining closely with class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. It greatly shortens the school system and unifies school education, family education, and social education. According to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational policy, the working class cultivates successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, which is a fundamental measure to prevent revisionism.

4. Implementing labor and study, in a few years, the school can solve all its financial expenses, greatly reducing the state's burden, and allowing the state to use a large amount of funds for socialist construction.

### 从两所小学的发展看厂办学校的优越性

    从两所小学的发展看厂办学校的优越性
    烟台机床附件厂小学，是一所厂办小学。东方红小学，是旧烟台专署直属机关公办小学。两个学校都是在一九六○年建立的，都有三百人左右，一个山南，一个山北。八年来，两个学校走过了两条截然不同的道路。为谁办学
    机床附件厂小学一诞生，就受到了修正主义教育路线的冲击，旧教育局走资派千方百计想挤垮它。但是，全厂革命工人却给予大力支持，帮助建校。在广大工人的关怀和支持下，这个学校不断成长壮大。他们按照工人阶级的心愿办学，入学新生不受年龄、时间、生理状况的限制，大一点的学生可以带弟弟妹妹上学，学校帮助照顾。学校也定期向工人征求意见，汇报工作。工人说：“厂办学校就是好，真正为我们工人阶级办事情。”
    东方红小学则推行了刘少奇的修正主义教育路线。开始，机关干部子女和工农子女还在一个学校上学，后来嫌工农子女“不卫生”、“野蛮”，便另建校舍，另立户头，办起了专署直属机关子女小学。招收学生三不要：工人子女不要，贫下中农子女不要，军人子女不要。近处的贫下中农子女无权入校学习，只好绕过这所学校到远处读书。贫下中农气愤地说：“这个学校和咱走的不是一条道。”怎样办学
    附件厂小学按照毛主席的教育方针，走“政治建校”“勤俭办学”的道路，设有
  “学习毛主席著作课”、“阶级教育课”、“革命传统教育课”、“劳动课”。经常请老工人作忆苦思甜报告、讲革命传统、办阶级教育展览，培养学生对党对毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，从小树立起阶级斗争和路线斗争观念。学生每周都下厂劳动，参加厂内各项政治运动，鼓励学生向工人阶级学习，关心国家大事，从小打上工人阶级的思想烙印。学校用具就地取材，因陋就简，师生自己动手修操场，垒乒乓球台。建校初期，用木板代替课桌，用砖头代替板凳。后来老工人从车间搜集了一批旧桌凳，进行了修整使用。
    东方红小学则是另一种情况，旧专署教育局走资派把“学习毛主席著作课”、“阶级教育课”、“革命传统教育课”、“劳动课”，看成是“巧立题目”，是对学生“下倾盆大雨”，“摧残学生的心灵”，因此，不准搞。相反却把《古代诗歌选》，自编复古《三字经》列为必修课。把“削铅笔”、“剪指甲”列为劳动课，美其名曰“培养文明习惯”。学生还分出了什么“书记班”、“部长班”（书记、部长的子女所在的班），给予特殊照顾。教学大搞“背、写、读”、“大考试”等繁杂的修正主义教育方式。对学生心身健康影响很大。有一次，大考试长达一周时间，学生生病率达百分之二十五。学校一切开支由教育局直接拨发，花钱大手大脚。比如，用三百多元钱买高级收音机学普通话。钢琴、手风琴、风琴有者即买。只学校一般开支（不算设备）每个学生每年就要由国家负担三十六元九角多，比厂办学校多一倍。培养什么样的接班人
    毛主席说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”机床附件厂小学较好地体现了毛主席的教育方针，培养出来的学生对工农感情深，爱劳动，阶级斗争观念和集体观念强。由于接触工人和参加厂内政治活动，阶级觉悟比较高，出现了许多大公无私、舍己救人、和阶级敌人作斗争的好人好事。学生自己组织起理发组，课余背起粪筐子拾粪。挖厕所、搞卫生，参加工厂劳动都争先恐后。冬天，学生自己生炉子。许多学生认识到：没有毛主席，就没有今天的幸福，长大了一定要好好为人民服务，党叫干啥就干啥。教师由于受工人阶级的教育和影响，思想面貌也发生了很大变化。
    东方红小学推行的是“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”的资产阶级教育路线，散布的是“读书做官”谬论。有的学生公开说自己长大了要“当大官、多拿钱、听电话、坐沙发、烤暖气”。有些学生灵魂深处等级观念严重，经常争吵谁的父母官大。在生活上讲究资产阶级“文明习惯”，自觉清高，傲视一切。有的学生嫌学校的厕所不好，下课后跑回家上厕所。吃穿讲究好的，怕脏怕累，四体不勤，五谷不分。革命群众气愤地说：“这个学校是个修正主义的‘试验田’！”在这样的环境里，一些出身于贫下中农家庭的教师，受到资产阶级思想的侵蚀，工农感情也渐渐淡薄。
    工人阶级必须掌管城市教育大权
    从上述两所小学的鲜明对比中，可以充分地看出厂办小学的优越性。
    我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家，工人阶级必须领导一切。必须用无产阶级世界观，用毛泽东思想培养后一代，因此，城市的小学和中学必须由工厂来办，由工人阶级领导。
    这样办学的好处是：
    一、工人阶级真正掌握了教育大权，实现无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政。从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。
    二、有利于对知识分子的再教育。在厂办学校，教师既是教员，又是工人，又是工人阶级的学生。和工人一起投入三大革命运动，最能促进教师世界观的改造，实现思想革命化，彻底改变过去那种严重脱离实际的状况，逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别。
    三、真正落实了毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示。从根本上改变了那种资产阶级培养学生三脱离（脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众）的恶劣倾向，变成了无产阶级教育的三结合（紧密结合阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验），大大缩短了学制，并使学校教育、家庭教育和社会教育统一起来，按照毛主席的无产阶级教育方针，由工人阶级培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，这是反修防修的根本大计。
    四、实行勤工俭学，不要几年时间，学校就可以解决一切经费的开支，大大减轻国家负担，使国家把一大笔经费用到社会主义建设上。
