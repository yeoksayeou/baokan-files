The heroic capital of Albania, Tirana, held a grand rally of over 4,000 people from various sectors of the city on the afternoon of December 2nd at the Tirana Partisan Sports Hall to warmly welcome the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng. The rally once again expressed the deep proletarian sentiments of the Albanian people towards Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, vividly demonstrating the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between Albania and China, which has been continuously strengthened and consolidated in the common struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

The Albanian party and government leaders who attended the meeting included: Adil Charchani, Bekir Balluku, Haki Toska, Hysni Kapo, Manush Myftiu, Mehmet Shehu, Ramiz Alia, Rita Marko, Spiro Koleka, Abdyl Kellezi, Kadri Hazbiu, Koço Theodhori, Petrit Dumo, Pilo Peristeri, Kafëz Spasiu, and Muslin Peza.

The meeting hall was adorned with large portraits of Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. The stage backdrop featured the national flags of Albania and China and a large banner reading "Long Live Albanian-Chinese Friendship." The walls around the venue were decorated with numerous banners reading "Long Live the Party of Labour of Albania," "Long Live the Communist Party of China," "Long Live the People's Republic of Albania," and "Long Live the People's Republic of China." Workers from the capital, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers and officers of the people's army, and officials from various departments arrived early at the venue, singing revolutionary songs and songs of Albanian-Chinese friendship.

When Shehu, Kapo, and Balluku escorted Huang Yongsheng and the entire delegation into the meeting hall, the entire audience stood up, applauded warmly, and cheered for a long time: "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!"

The meeting was presided over by Manush Myftiu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the first secretary of the Tirana District Committee. After announcing the start of the meeting, the orchestra played the national anthems of both countries. Subsequently, Bekir Balluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, and Huang Yongsheng, the leader of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, delivered passionate speeches (the full texts of Balluku's and Huang Yongsheng's speeches will be published separately). Their speeches were met with extremely enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. The attendees stood up and cheered repeatedly: "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" "Long Live the Party of Labour of Albania!" "Long Live the Communist Party of China!" "Long Live the Albanian People's Army!" "Long Live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Long Live Albanian-Chinese Friendship!"

Huang Yongsheng, on behalf of the entire Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, presented a banner to the meeting. The banner read: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together," a quote from Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania.

Huang Yongsheng handed the banner to Comrade Myftiu and shook hands warmly with Shehu, Kapo, Balluku, and Myftiu, embracing them tightly. The entire audience immediately erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. Shehu, Kapo, Balluku, and other comrades shook hands with the entire delegation and joined the attendees in enthusiastically cheering for the combat camaraderie between the brotherly peoples of Albania and China.

The temporary charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Tingcang, military attache Li Zhongxuan, embassy staff, and Chinese engineering and technical personnel and students in Albania were also invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting concluded with the stirring tune of the "Internationale."

The meeting was jointly organized by the Tirana District Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Executive Committee of the Tirana District People's Assembly, and the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association.
