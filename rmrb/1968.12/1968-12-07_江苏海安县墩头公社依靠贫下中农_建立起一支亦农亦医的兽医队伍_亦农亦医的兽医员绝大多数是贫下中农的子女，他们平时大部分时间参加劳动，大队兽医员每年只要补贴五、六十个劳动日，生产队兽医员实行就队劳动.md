The Duntou Commune in Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, has actively established and trained a team of veterinarians who are both farmers and doctors, forming a three-tiered medical network at the commune, brigade, and production team levels. This has completely changed the situation where old veterinarians monopolized the countryside.

Currently, the entire commune has 125 veterinarians who are both farmers and doctors, with 10 at the brigade level and 115 at the production team level. Most of these individuals are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. They have good political awareness, love labor, and generally have a primary school education or higher, with an average age of around 20. They spend most of their time participating in labor, and their absence from work is minimal. Brigade-level veterinarians only need to make up for 50 to 60 workdays per year; production team-level veterinarians work within their own teams. Some production team veterinarians are also livestock keepers, combining treatment and feeding. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are delighted to see their own team of veterinarians. They say that veterinarians who are both farmers and doctors are the best! They are good because they come from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, are not afraid of hard work, dirt, or fatigue, study hard, and treat diseases seriously; they are good because they are both farmers and doctors, working and treating livestock, with minimal absence from work and light burden, which the poor and lower-middle peasants can afford; they are good because they respond promptly to calls, are convenient for the masses, and provide timely treatment.

Due to the establishment of a team of veterinarians who are both farmers and doctors, the situation where cattle with diseases were sent to the county, pigs with diseases were taken to the commune, and castration was done outside has been changed. Now, livestock with minor illnesses do not leave the team, major illnesses do not leave the commune, and castration is done at the doorstep. Livestock disease prevention work is becoming more and more effective. This team of veterinarians not only focuses on the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases but also on feeding and production, significantly promoting the development of the livestock industry.

This team of veterinarians who are both farmers and doctors has grown in the midst of fierce struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. Before liberation, the rural veterinarians here were mostly demons and scoundrels, social dregs, who extorted and exploited the laboring people, committing all sorts of evil. After liberation, although a batch of livestock and veterinary personnel were trained in schools and colleges, due to a handful of capitalist roaders stubbornly pushing the revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi, most of these personnel remained in county-level and above livestock and veterinary departments, long detached from the masses, rarely going to the countryside. Although the countryside also trained some veterinarians, their numbers were very few, and they were also suppressed and persecuted by a handful of capitalist roaders. Livestock disease prevention work in the countryside was still controlled by a handful of demons and scoundrels. The long-term lack of medical treatment and medicines for livestock diseases in the countryside has seriously affected the development of livestock production. Therefore, establishing a new type of veterinary team has become an urgent demand of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In 1965, during the great socialist education movement, the commune, based on the voices of the poor and lower-middle peasants and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, trained a batch of rural veterinarians, seizing back the power of livestock disease prevention from a handful of demons and scoundrels. However, due to the obstruction of old habits, the newly born veterinary team could not fully play its role. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution removed obstacles for the growth of revolutionary new things. The veterinary team of farmers and doctors, deeply loved by the poor and lower-middle peasants, has rapidly developed and grown stronger under the strong support of the commune revolutionary committee.

To quickly improve the political and professional levels of this team of veterinarians who are both farmers and doctors, the commune revolutionary committee has taken the following effective measures:

	•	Hold short-term training classes. The main responsibility lies with the commune veterinary station and the food procurement station, with each class lasting 4 to 10 days. In the training classes, the main focus is on repeatedly studying the "Three Articles," establishing the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people and learning veterinary medicine for the revolution; in terms of professional skills, the focus is on popularizing the prevention and treatment methods of common diseases and castration techniques, emphasizing the combination of theory and practice, learning while practicing, concentrating on lectures, and dividing into groups for practice. For example, after learning injection techniques, go to the food procurement station to give injections to livestock; after learning castration techniques, perform castration on pigs and chickens at the food procurement station. Such training has been very effective.

	•	Establish a regular study system. The veterinary station holds two meetings per month to gather brigade-level veterinarians, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and giving technical courses based on current tasks, exchanging experiences, and learning from each other. Brigade-level veterinarians hold three meetings per month to gather production team veterinarians for study. When the brigade organizes study sessions, the commune veterinary station also sends people to participate and study together with the veterinarians. In this way, the three-level veterinary personnel can frequently study, work, and meet, timely discovering and solving problems, exchanging experiences, and improving together.

	•	Go to practice, use the pig farm as a classroom, and conduct on-site teaching. The veterinarians of the commune veterinary station are divided into areas, with each person responsible for two brigades, often combining mobile medical services to bring brigade-level veterinarians to the pig farm as a classroom for on-site teaching. Practice has proven that this method is the fastest way to improve the professional level of veterinarians.

	In addition, the commune also adopts methods such as point-to-face promotion to vigorously promote advanced experiences, which also plays a very good role in improving the political and professional levels of veterinarians.

    江苏海安县墩头公社依靠贫下中农
    建立起一支亦农亦医的兽医队伍
    亦农亦医的兽医员绝大多数是贫下中农的子女，他们平时大部分时间参加劳动，大队兽医员每年只要补贴五、六十个劳动日，生产队兽医员实行就队劳动
    新华社南京六日电　江苏省海安县墩头公社积极建立和培养了一支亦农亦医的兽医队伍，建立起了一个公社、大队、生产队三级医疗网，彻底改变了旧兽医独霸农村的状况。
    目前，全公社共有亦农亦医的兽医员一百二十五人，其中大队十人，生产队一百一十五人。这些人绝大多数是贫下中农的子女，思想好，爱劳动，一般具有完小以上文化程度，平均年龄二十岁左右。他们平时大部分时间参加劳动，误工很少。大队兽医员每年只要补贴五、六十个劳动日；生产队兽医员实行就队劳动，有的生产队兽医员就是饲养员，把治疗和饲养结合了起来。广大贫下中农眼看有了自己的兽医队伍，都欢欣鼓舞地说，亦农亦医的兽医员就是好！好就好在他们是贫下中农出身，不怕苦，不怕脏，不怕累，学习刻苦，防治认真；好就好在他们亦农亦医，既劳动又给牲口看病，误工少，负担轻，贫下中农养得起；好就好在他们一喊就到，方便群众，治疗及时。
    由于建立了一支亦农亦医的兽医队伍，改变了过去牛生病送县城，猪生病跑公社，阉割到外地的状况，基本上做到牲畜有小病不出队，大病不出社，阉割送上门，牲畜防疫工作越做越出色。这支兽医队伍，不仅抓牲畜疫病的防治，而且抓饲养，抓生产，有力地促进了畜牧事业的发展。
    这支亦农亦医的兽医队伍，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中成长起来的。解放前，这里的农村兽医大都是牛鬼蛇神、社会渣滓，他们对劳动人民敲榨勒索，无恶不作。解放后，虽然在大、中学校培养了一批畜牧兽医人员，但是由于一小撮走资派顽固地推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，使这些人员绝大部分都留在县以上的畜牧兽医部门，长期脱离群众，很少下农村。农村虽然自己也培养了一些兽医，但是数量极少，还受到一小撮走资派的排挤、打击。农村的兽疫防治工作仍然控制在一小撮牛鬼蛇神手里。农村长期以来牲畜有了疫病缺医缺药的结果，使畜牧生产的发展受到严重损害。因此，建立一支新型的兽医队伍，成了广大贫下中农的迫切要求。一九六五年，在伟大的社会主义教育运动中，公社根据贫下中农的呼声，在解放军的帮助下，培养了一批农村兽医员，从一小撮牛鬼蛇神手中夺回了牲畜疫病防治大权。但是由于旧习惯势力的阻挠，新生的兽医队伍仍然不能充分发挥作用。无产阶级文化大革命为革命的新生事物的成长扫除了障碍，深受贫下中农爱戴的亦农亦医的兽医队伍，在公社革委会的大力支持下，迅速地发展壮大起来。
    为了尽快提高这支亦农亦医兽医队伍的政治和业务水平，公社革委会采取了以下一些有效措施：
    举办短期训练班。主要由公社兽医站和食品收购站具体负责，训练班时间每期四到十天。在训练班上，主要是反复学习“老三篇”，树立完全彻底为人民、学兽医为革命的思想；在业务上，以普及常见病的防治方法和阉割技术为主，强调理论联系实际，边教学边实践，集中听课，分组实习。例如，学了注射技术，就到食品收购站去为牲畜打针；学了阉割技术，就在食品收购站阉猪、阉鸡。这样的训练，效果很好。
    建立定期的学习制度。兽医站每月两次把大队兽医员集中在一起，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，同时根据当前任务需要上技术课，相互交流经验，取长补短。大队兽医员每月三次把生产队的兽医员集中起来进行学习。大队组织学习时，公社兽医站也派人参加，同兽医员一起学习。这样，三级兽医人员做到勤学、勤做、勤碰头，及时发现问题、解决问题，相互交流经验，共同提高。
    到实践中去，以猪场为课堂，进行现场带教。公社兽医站的兽医分工包片，每人负责两个大队，经常结合巡回医疗，带着大队兽医员，以猪场为课堂，进行现场带教。实践证明，这样做，兽医员的业务水平提高得最快。
    除此以外，公社还采取以点带面等方法，大力推广先进经验，对提高兽医员的政治和业务水平也起了很好的作用。
