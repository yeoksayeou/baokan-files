One day, Kong Yi, a young intellectual sent from Hangzhou City to Liu Gou Brigade in Shizi Commune under the Sixiang Mountains in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, went to the cow shed with the poor and lower-middle peasants to collect manure. After working for a while, it got hot. The commune members took off their clothes and casually placed them on the cow trough. Kong Yi also took off his clothes, intending to hang them on the wall, but there was no place to hang them. He thought about putting them on the ground, but there was no clean spot. Seeing this, a poor peasant took the clothes from Kong Yi's hands and placed them on his own clothes. This silent action struck Kong Yi's soul like an electric current.

That night, Kong Yi couldn't sleep. He thought about what had happened during the day and recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung on them, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." Kong Yi had read this passage many times, but today it felt particularly close to his heart, as if every word and sentence were directed at him. He deeply realized that clothes with cow dung on them can be washed clean, but dust on the mind is not so easy to wipe off. His fear of dirt was due to the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, which had caused him to be separated from the workers and peasants and from labor for a long time. He made a firm resolution to, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, study Chairman Mao's works earnestly and thoroughly change his old thoughts. From then on, Kong Yi's consciousness of self-reform increased. He constantly looked for differences between himself and the poor and lower-middle peasants, and whenever he found any shortcomings or mistakes, he would study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and correct them resolutely.

    灵魂深处闹革命
    有一天，从杭州市到宁夏回族自治区六盘山下的什字公社刘沟大队插队落户的知识青年孔毅和贫下中农一起去牛圈起粪。干了一会儿热起来。社员们把衣服脱了随便放在牛槽上。孔毅也脱了衣服，想往墙上挂，墙上没处挂，想往地上撂，又没块干净的地方。一个贫农社员看到这种情况，马上从他手里把衣服接过来，放在自己的衣服上。这个无声的动作象一股电流，猛烈地触动了孔毅的灵魂。
    当天夜里，孔毅怎么也睡不着。联系白天发生的事情，他又重温了毛主席的教导：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净”。这段话，孔毅早已读过许多次，可是今天感到分外亲切，好象字字句句都是对自己说的。他深刻认识到：衣服上沾了牛屎，洗一洗就掉了；思想上沾了灰尘，可不容易擦掉。自己所以怕脏，就是因为受了大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，长期脱离工农，脱离劳动。他暗暗下定决心，一定要在贫下中农的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改变旧思想。从这以后，孔毅改造思想的自觉性更高了。他时时处处注意找和贫下中农的差距，发现缺点错误就学毛主席的有关教导，坚决改正。（据新华社银川电）
