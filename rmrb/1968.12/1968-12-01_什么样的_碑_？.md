Title: What Kind of "Monument"?

In the reactionary film *Visiting Indonesia*, the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi shamelessly portrayed his betrayal of the proletariat and revolutionary people as a "milestone" in developing friendly relations between the two countries. Clearly a crow, he still tries to cover himself with peacock feathers.

Liu Shaoqi's "milestone" during his nine-day "visit" to Indonesia is indeed a black monument, a monument to serving the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

The leaders of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are pleased to have such a "red comprador" in the "free world family." Liu Shaoqi, this shameless scoundrel who revels in and frequently praises the life of a lackey, uses this reactionary film to boast about his "merits," praising his black masters everywhere, beautifying the reactionary army as a "revolutionary tool" for realizing the people's ideals, plastering gold on their faces, creating reactionary public opinion to deceive the people, and helping them slaughter more revolutionary people. This traitor, spy, and scab who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks for decades is not only a running dog and accomplice of the Kuomintang reactionaries but also a running dog and accomplice of international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. His actions, as Mr. Lu Xun said, "are tame when encountering all the rich," which "is evidence of belonging to all capitalists."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All the aggressors and their running dogs in the world will be buried, and the time will not be long. They will definitely not escape." Liu Shaoqi, the faithful running dog of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, harmed the revolutionary people, did countless evil deeds, and played countless tricks, but he could not escape the judgment of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. He was finally driven off the historical stage. All the lackeys and henchmen of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, all kinds of traitors and scabs, will meet the same fate as Liu Shaoqi, and their end will be to be buried in the surging tide of the world's revolutionary people.

    什么样的“碑”？
    红铁兵
    在反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》中，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇竟然恬不知耻地把他自己背叛无产阶级和革命人民的勾当，描绘成发展两国人民友好关系的“里程碑”。分明是乌鸦，却还要用孔雀的羽毛为自己遮丑。
    刘少奇在印尼“访问”九天的“里程”中，的确是立了一块“碑”。此碑不是别的，就是为帝、修、反卖命效劳的黑碑。
    帝、修、反的头目们为有这样一个“自由世界大家庭”的“红色买办”感到“欣慰”。而刘少奇这个津津乐道、频频赞赏奴才生活的无耻之徒，也就通过这部反动影片，极尽其“丑表功”之能事，到处吹捧他的黑主子们，把反动军队美化为“实现人民理想的”“革命工具”，给他们脸上拚命贴金，为他们大造麻痹人民的反动舆论，帮助他们去屠杀更多的革命人民。这个混入革命队伍几十年的叛徒、内奸、工贼，不仅是国民党反动派的走狗和帮凶，而且是国际上帝、修、反的走狗和帮凶。这个走狗的行径，正象鲁迅先生说的那样，它“遇见所有的阔人都驯良”，这“就是属于所有的资本家的证据”。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切侵略者及其走狗，通通都要被埋葬掉，为期不会很远。他们一定逃不掉的。”帝、修、反的忠实走狗刘少奇残害革命人民，做尽了坏事，耍尽了阴谋，但他逃不掉中国人民和世界革命人民的判决，终于被赶出了历史舞台。一切美帝、苏修的奴仆爪牙，一切形形色色的叛徒、工贼，他们的命运也将和刘少奇一样，只能是葬身于世界人民革命的滚滚洪流之中。
