The revolutionary committees at various levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have led the people of all ethnic groups in the region to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have carried out Mao's instruction to "pay attention to historical experience. One line, one viewpoint, must be repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture only a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must all know about it." They have extensively and deeply launched a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, which has powerfully promoted the further development of the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of the class ranks.

Through earnestly launching the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad revolutionary masses in various places have further heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and have launched a new upsurge in the revolutionary criticism. The capital of the autonomous region, Hohhot, and other leagues and cities have all held mass rallies and radio broadcasts with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of participants to denounce the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Many remote villages, pastures, forest farms, and mines have also held rallies to denounce Liu Shaoqi. Many old workers, old poor peasants, and old impoverished herdsmen have crossed mountains and rivers to attend the rallies, filled with indignation, and have used their personal experiences of blood and tears in the old society to denounce the crimes of the running dogs of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and the backstage boss of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in Inner Mongolia.

Through deeply launching the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the members of the revolutionary committees at various levels and the broad revolutionary masses have deeply understood that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Chairman Mao's views on class and class struggle, and Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat must be lectured year after year, month after month, and day after day, and must be known by the broad revolutionary masses; they must resolutely oppose the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie and advance victoriously under the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment. The broad revolutionary masses in places like Hohhot and Baotou, in conjunction with the work of cleansing the class ranks, have repeatedly studied the section in Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee on the "Guihua method": "This method of struggle will leave more remnants of counter-revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary political influence than the Beijing method, and the time for their preservation will also be longer. However, these remnants of counter-revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary political influence will ultimately be eliminated, which is undoubted. It is not possible to think that the counter-revolutionary forces have submitted to us, and their counter-revolutionary thoughts and counter-revolutionary intentions no longer exist. It is not like this. Many of them will be reformed, some of them will be eliminated, and some resolute counter-revolutionaries will be suppressed." The broad revolutionary masses have used Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings as a weapon to severely criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Inner Mongolia for their heinous crimes of surrendering to and using counter-revolutionaries, protecting and promoting counter-revolutionaries, and even pulling some counter-revolutionaries into the party. The broad revolutionary masses have used Chairman Mao's teachings as a weapon to discuss the long-term and complex nature of class struggle, to investigate the facts of class struggle, to launch a comprehensive attack on the class enemies hiding in every corner, and to expose a batch of hidden counter-revolutionaries in a short period of time.

    紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署乘胜前进
    内蒙古各族革命人民通过两条路线斗争史的学习，有力地推动了革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作的进一步开展
    据新华社呼和浩特十三日电　内蒙古自治区各级革命委员会率领全区各族革命人民，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，遵照毛主席的“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，广泛深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，有力地推动了革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作的进一步开展。
    各地广大革命群众通过认真开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，掀起了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判的新高潮。自治区首府呼和浩特市和其他各盟市，都分别召开了有几万人到十几万人参加的声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇滔天罪行的大会和有线广播大会。许多边远的山村、牧场、林场、矿山也纷纷举行声讨刘少奇的大会。一些老工人、老贫农、老贫苦牧民，翻山涉水，赶到会场，怀着满腔怒火，以自己在旧社会亲身经历的血泪家史、厂史、村史，愤怒控诉了帝、修、反的走狗，地、富、反、坏、右的总后台刘少奇及其在内蒙古代理人的滔天罪行。
    通过深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，各级革委会成员和广大革命群众深刻地认识到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大学说，必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲，必须使广大革命群众都知道；必须坚决反对资产阶级的反动的“多中心论”，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署胜利前进。呼和浩特市和包头市等地广大革命群众，结合清理阶级队伍的工作，反复学习了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告中关于“绥远方式”的一段教导：“这种斗争方式对于反革命遗迹和反革命的政治影响，较之北平方式将要保留得较多些，保留的时间也将较长些。但是这种反革命遗迹和反革命政治影响，归根到底要被肃清，这是毫无疑问的。决不可以认为反革命力量顺从我们了，他们就成了革命党了，他们的反革命思想和反革命企图就不存在了。决不是这样。他们中的许多人将被改造，他们中的一部分人将被淘汰，某些坚决反革命分子将受到镇压。”广大革命群众以毛主席的这一英明教导为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在内蒙古代理人招降纳叛，包庇重用反革命分子，甚至把某些反革命分子拉入党内等滔天罪行。广大革命群众以毛主席的教导为武器，大议阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性，深入调查阶级斗争的事实，向隐藏在各个角落的阶级敌人发动全面进攻，在不太长的时间内挖出了一批暗藏的反革命分子。
