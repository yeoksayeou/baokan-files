The Indonesian Communist Party Central Delegation Issues Statement: The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC Has Great Historical Significance

The decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made China, this world revolutionary bastion, even more solid. The destruction of the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi is a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

New China News Agency, December 1st: The Indonesian Communist Party Central Delegation issued a statement signed by Yussuf Adjitorop, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party and the head of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Delegation, on November 9th. The title of the statement is: "The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC Has Great Historical Significance for the Chinese People and the People of All Countries."

The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, held in Beijing from October 13th to 31st, 1968, under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, was a historic event of great significance not only for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people but also for Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world. Indonesian communists and revolutionary people enthusiastically welcome the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. This plenum summarized the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party pointed out in a statement issued on May 23, 1967: "The great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are of great historical significance internationally. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant results in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, purging modern revisionists who follow the capitalist road from within the Communist Party of China, state organs, and cultural departments, and consolidating socialist China as the strongest and most reliable world revolutionary bastion. The revolutionary people of Indonesia and the revolutionary people of the whole world together enthusiastically welcome the great victory of the Chinese people and the great thought of Mao Zedong." The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC summarized the victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which have further developed from what was pointed out by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party above.

Over the past two years, during the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, there has been a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads—that is, a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, and the socialist road and the capitalist road. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Communist Party members and revolutionary masses in China have waged an uncompromising struggle against a handful of power-holders within the Party who follow the capitalist road, traitors, and spies. These power-holders within the Party who follow the capitalist road, traitors, and spies have usurped part of the power of the Party and proletarian dictatorship to prepare for the restoration of capitalism in China. As the communiqué of the plenum correctly points out, the core of the struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the issue of power, the issue of the struggle for leadership between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the issue of whether the leadership of the Party and the state is in the hands of Marxists or revisionists. Chairman Mao pointed out in his latest directive: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism." Due to the close follow-up of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the implementation of a series of policies and directives of the proletarian headquarters, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great and decisive victories. Revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except Taiwan. This has made the dictatorship of the proletariat increasingly consolidated, shattered the dreams of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries to restore capitalism in China, and promoted the development of socialist construction to an unprecedented extent. Due to the great and decisive victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's position as the main world revolutionary bastion has been further consolidated.

Over the past two years, the Communist Party members and revolutionary masses in China have waged a revolutionary criticism against the stinking reactionary revisionist thoughts of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, who infiltrated the Party and acted as a running dog of imperialism, revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist thoughts of opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat and advocating "peaceful transition" have also played a very bad role in the international communist movement. Indonesian communists are still waging a struggle to thoroughly eliminate the opportunist-revisionist line adopted by the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party from 1951 to 1965, which deviates from the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the thought of Mao Zedong. They have drawn extremely valuable experience and lessons from the revolutionary criticism waged by the Communist Party members and revolutionary masses in China during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, using the thought of Mao Zedong as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and expose the stinking reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi. The Indonesian communists and revolutionary people, together with the Chinese people and Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of all countries, fully support the decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently, revoke all his positions within and outside the Party, and continue to settle accounts with the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices of betraying the Party and the country. The Indonesian communists and revolutionary people also support the decision of this plenum on the necessity of continuing to carry out the revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminate the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi. For the Indonesian communists and revolutionary people themselves, only by continuing to carry out criticism and eliminating the remnants of the opportunist-revisionist line adopted by the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party from 1951 to 1965 can they well walk the new road of the Indonesian revolution, advance along the road opened up by the Chinese revolution, which is the road of armed struggle led by the proletariat. The reactionary revisionist crimes of Liu Shaoqi are not only crimes against the Chinese people but also crimes against Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of all countries. The destruction of the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi within the Communist Party of China is a heavy blow to imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and reactionaries of all countries.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao more than two years ago has not only changed the spiritual face of the Chinese people but also changed the spiritual face of the people of all countries. One of the great and important achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is that the thought of Mao Zedong, which has become the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, has been widely spread not only among the 700 million Chinese people but also among revolutionary people all over the world. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC correctly reaffirmed: The thought of Mao Zedong, when grasped by the broad masses of the people, produces tremendous material force. Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries are currently surging forward, dealing decisive blows to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. As Chairman Mao said, "The current world revolution has entered a great new era." Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people has also entered a new stage. After abandoning the revisionist "peaceful road," the Marxist-Leninists in Indonesia, under the guidance of the new "three banners" of the Party in accordance with the thought of Mao Zedong, are currently leading the long-term armed struggle of the people to overthrow the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution in the vast rural areas.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has created sufficient conditions for the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in terms of ideology, politics, and organization. The plenum also decided to convene this congress at an appropriate time. This is not only the greatest, most important, and most inspiring news for the communists and people of China but also for the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of Indonesia and the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the whole world. They welcome the imminent Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China with full enthusiasm and the best hopes. They are convinced that this congress will further consolidate the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and realize that this congress will have extremely important historical significance for the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the whole world, for the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries, and especially for the international communist movement. The Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be convened after the Communist Party of China has been tempered, purified its ranks, and undergone a great rectification during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It will further consolidate the position of the Communist Party of China as the outstanding banner-bearer of Marxism, Leninism, and the thought of Mao Zedong and the vanguard of the international communist movement. The convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be a heavy blow to the modern revisionists headed by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in its further betrayal of the world proletariat and Marxism-Leninism and its activities to split the international communist movement, has long attempted to convene a revisionist international party conference. These parties have long been the historical dregs that have sold out to imperialism.

The current situation is favorable to the proletariat and revolutionary people of all countries and even more unfavorable to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. In their attempts to avoid collapse, U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists have further intensified their collusion to redivide the world, as exemplified by their mutual indulgence in their aggression in Vietnam and Czechoslovakia. However, their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China "holy alliance" will surely be smashed to pieces against the iron wall of the revolutionary people of all countries. In Indonesia, the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution, the running dog of U.S. imperialism and the ally of Soviet modern revisionism, in order to extricate itself from the current predicament caused by the development of the people's revolutionary movement, has further sold out the country to foreign monopoly capital, primarily U.S. monopoly capital. They even cede Indonesian territory as a military base for U.S. imperialism to suppress the armed resistance of the Indonesian people and the people of other Southeast Asian countries and to attempt to encircle and invade China. To obtain more "aid" from the imperialists, they have recently intensified the new persecution of the communists and revolutionary people of Indonesia. However, no matter what tricks the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution plays, their difficulties are insurmountable because they are reactionary forces approaching the grave. On the contrary, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the revolutionary people of Indonesia, who have already started armed struggle and persist in this struggle, will surely be able to smash the treacherous regime of Suharto-Nasution.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC reaffirmed that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, based on proletarian internationalism, firmly support and genuinely assist the struggle of the revolutionary people of all countries against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against the reactionaries of all countries. The communists and revolutionary people of Indonesia, in their struggle for liberation, have from the beginning felt the significance of the firm support and genuine assistance provided by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. When the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people led by the Indonesian Communist Party encountered difficulties, the editorial of the eleventh issue of the 1967 issue of the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the "Red Flag" magazine, clearly stated: "The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are always concerned about the struggle of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people. Our hearts are closely linked with the hearts of our class brothers in Indonesia. We stand firmly with the Indonesian Communist Party and the revolutionary people of Indonesia, resolutely supporting the Indonesian Communist Party in leading the Indonesian people to overthrow the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution and build a completely independent and democratic new Indonesia." The firm support and genuine assistance of the Communist Party of China and the 700 million Chinese people have greatly encouraged the communists and revolutionary people of Indonesia to overcome the various difficulties encountered in the long-term and tortuous armed struggle to overthrow the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution and build a people's democratic regime in Indonesia.

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader and teacher of the revolutionary people of the world!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

    印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团发表声明
    中共八届十二中全会具有伟大的历史意义
    无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，使中国这个世界革命堡垒更加巩固。摧毁以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部是对帝、修、反的沉重打击。
    新华社一日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团，十一月九日发表了由印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局委员、印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团团长尤素福·阿吉托罗普同志签署的一篇声明，题目是：《中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会对中国人民和世界各国人民有着伟大的历史意义》。
    声明全文如下：
    中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会在毛泽东同志亲自主持下，从一九六八年十月十三日至三十一日在北京举行。毛泽东同志在会上作了极其重要的讲话。这不仅对中国共产党人和中国人民，而且对世界各国的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，也是一个具有历史意义的重大事件。印度尼西亚的共产党人和革命人民热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表。这个全会总结了两年多来中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局在一九六七年五月二十三日发表的声明中指出：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就是国际上具有伟大历史意义的最伟大的事件。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中已经取得了辉煌的成就，从中国共产党内、国家机构内、文化部门中清除了走资本主义道路的现代修正主义分子，巩固了作为最强大、最可靠的世界革命堡垒的社会主义中国。印度尼西亚革命人民和全世界革命人民一道，热烈欢呼中国人民和毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会总结了无产阶级文化大革命所取得的胜利，这些胜利比印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局在上面所指出的有了进一步的发展。
    两年多来，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，在中国进行着两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路的剧烈斗争，即无产阶级和资产阶级、无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线、社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的你死我活的斗争。在以毛主席为首、林彪同志为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，中国的共产党人和革命群众同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、叛徒和特务展开了无情的斗争。这些党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、叛徒和特务为了在中国复辟资本主义作准备而篡夺了党和无产阶级专政的一部分权力。正如全会公报正确指出的，无产阶级文化大革命斗争的中心，是政权问题，是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺领导权问题，是党和国家的领导权掌握在马克思主义者或修正主义者手里的问题。毛主席在他的最新指示中指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”由于紧跟毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战略部署以及落实了无产阶级司令部的一系列政策和指示，中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的决定性的胜利，除台湾省以外的省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会。这样就使无产阶级专政越来越巩固，粉碎了帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派在中国复辟资本主义的梦想，同时空前地推动了社会主义建设的向前发展。由于无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的决定性的胜利，中国作为世界革命主要堡垒的地位就更加巩固了。
    两年来，中国的共产党人和革命群众对混入党内，充当帝国主义、修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的臭不可闻的反革命修正主义思想，展开了革命大批判。刘少奇反对无产阶级专政、鼓吹“和平过渡”的反革命修正主义思想，他关于党的建设的修正主义思想以及对抗马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的其他资产阶级思想，在国际共产主义运动中也起了极坏的作用。印度尼西亚共产党人仍在展开斗争，彻底铲除印度尼西亚共产党领导在一九五一年至一九六五年时期所采取的机会主义—修正主义路线，即背离马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则的路线。他们从无产阶级文化大革命期间运用毛泽东思想为武器彻底批臭刘少奇的臭不可闻的反革命修正主义思想的中国共产党人和革命群众所开展的革命大批判中，吸取了极其宝贵的经验教训。印度尼西亚的共产党人和革命人民同中国人民以及世界各国的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民一道，完全拥护中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行的决议。印度尼西亚的共产党人和革命人民也拥护这次全会关于继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想的必要性的决定。对印度尼西亚的共产党人和革命人民本身来说，只有继续进行批判，清除印度尼西亚共产党领导在一九五一年至一九六五年时期所采取的机会主义—修正主义路线的残余，才能很好地走印度尼西亚革命的新道路，沿着中国革命开拓了的道路前进，这就是无产阶级领导下的农民武装斗争道路。刘少奇的反革命修正主义罪行，不仅是对中国人民犯下的罪行，而且是对世界各国的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民犯下的罪行。在中国共产党内部以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部被摧毁了，这对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义、以苏联修正主义叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派，是一个沉重的打击。
    两年多以前由毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命不仅改变了中国人民的精神面貌，而且也改变了世界各国人民的精神面貌。无产阶级文化大革命的一个巨大而重要的功绩，是使成为当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰的毛泽东思想不仅在七亿中国人民中，而且在世界所有各地的革命人民中得到广泛的传播。中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会正确地重申：毛泽东思想被广大人民群众所掌握，就产生了巨大的物质力量。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，世界各国人民的革命运动目前正在汹涌澎湃地发展，给予帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派以决定性的打击。正如毛主席所说的，当前“世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代”。在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，印度尼西亚人民的革命斗争也进入了一个新阶段。在抛弃修正主义的“和平道路”以后，当前，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者，在符合毛泽东思想的党的新的“三面旗帜”的照耀下，正在广大的农村地区领导推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的长期的人民武装斗争。
    中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报指出，无产阶级文化大革命已经从思想上、政治上、组织上为召开中国共产党第九次全国代表大会创造了充分的条件。全会同时决定了在适当的时候召开这个代表大会。这不仅对中国的共产党人和人民，而且对印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民以及全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民也是最大、最重要和最令人鼓舞的消息。他们以满腔的热情和最美好的希望迎接中国共产党即将召开的第九次全国代表大会。他们坚信这个代表大会一定会进一步巩固中国无产阶级文化大革命的成果，同时意识到这个代表大会对全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，对世界各国人民的革命运动，特别是对国际共产主义运动将具有极其重大的历史意义。中国共产党的第九次全国代表大会，将在中国共产党在无产阶级文化大革命中得到锤炼，纯洁其队伍和大整顿之后召开，它将进一步巩固中国共产党作为马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的杰出旗手和国际共产主义运动的先锋的地位。中国共产党第九次全国代表大会的召开，对以苏共修正主义叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者是一个沉重的打击。苏共修正主义叛徒集团在进一步背叛世界无产阶级和马克思列宁主义以及分裂国际共产主义运动的活动中，早就妄图召开修正主义党的国际会议，这些党早就是卖身投靠帝国主义的历史渣滓。
    当前的形势对世界各国的无产阶级和革命人民有利，对帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派更加不利。在妄图避免其垮台的活动中，美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者进一步加紧他们的相互勾结，以便重新瓜分世界，如突出表现在他们对他们在越南和捷克斯洛伐克的侵略所采取的互相纵容的态度上。但是，他们所结成的反共、反人民和反华的“神圣同盟”必将在世界各国革命人民力量的铜墙铁壁面前碰得头破血流。在印度尼西亚，美帝国主义的走狗和苏联现代修正主义的同盟者苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权，为了使自己能摆脱眼前由于人民革命运动发展所引起的困境，便进一步把国家出卖给外国垄断资本，首先是美国垄断资本。他们甚至让出印度尼西亚领土作为美帝国主义的军事基地，以镇压印度尼西亚人民和东南亚其他国家人民的武装反抗，并妄图包围和侵略中国。为了博得帝国主义者更多的“援助”，最近，他们加紧对印度尼西亚的共产党人和革命人民的新的迫害。但是，不管苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权进行什么勾当，他们的困难是克服不了的，因为他们是正接近坟墓的反动力量。相反的，在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，已经开始进行武装斗争并且顽强地坚持这一斗争的印度尼西亚革命人民，最后一定能够粉碎苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国政权。
    中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报重申，中国共产党和中国人民根据无产阶级国际主义，对世界各国革命人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义、反对各国反动派的斗争给予坚决的支持和真正的声援。印度尼西亚的共产党人和革命人民在为争取解放而进行的斗争中，从一开始就体会到中国共产党和中国人民所给予的坚决支持和真正的声援的意义。当印度尼西亚共产党领导的印度尼西亚人民革命斗争遭到困难的时候，中国共产党中央委员会机关刊物《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十一期的社论明确表示：“中国共产党和中国人民每时每刻都在关心着印尼共产党和印尼人民的战斗。我们的心，是同印度尼西亚阶级兄弟的心，紧密联系在一起的。我们坚定不移地同印尼共产党站在一边，同印尼革命人民站在一边，坚决支持印尼共产党领导印尼人民，为推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权，建立一个完全独立的民主的新印尼而进行的斗争”。中国共产党和七亿中国人民的坚决支持和真正的声援，大大地鼓舞了印度尼西亚的共产党人和革命人民克服在推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权和建立印度尼西亚人民民主政权而进行的长期的、充满着曲折的武装斗争中所碰到的种种困难。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    世界各国革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
