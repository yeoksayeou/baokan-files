The Nadanber People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has used the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the local area to educate the masses, effectively promoting the deepening of the struggle-criticism-transformation movement throughout the commune.

The Nadanber People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "seriously carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation" and "carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Using the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué as a weapon, they have mobilized and firmly relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants to investigate the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside. This has brought about a new and magnificent situation in the commune's struggle-criticism-transformation mass movement. Investigating the history of the struggle between the two lines in the countryside is the guide to deepening the struggle-criticism-transformation.

After the establishment of the Nadanber People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they vigorously promoted the struggle-criticism-transformation throughout the commune. However, after achieving some success, some committee members developed a "good enough" attitude. At this time, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, and the propaganda team immediately helped the commune's revolutionary committee to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. They reviewed the situation of the struggle-criticism-transformation in the commune against the communiqué, making everyone realize that it was not that the struggle-criticism-transformation was "good enough," but that it was far from meeting the requirements of the communiqué. How to deepen the struggle-criticism-transformation step by step? With this question in mind, they listened to the experience shared by the Nadanber Brigade Revolutionary Committee. This brigade had not resolved a long-standing difficult problem for over a year, but through investigating the history of the struggle between the two roads, they quickly clarified the issue, thereby vigorously promoting the struggle-criticism-transformation in the brigade.

The members of the commune's revolutionary committee learned from the experience of the Nadanber Brigade that an important reason why the struggle-criticism-transformation could not be deepened was that they did not understand the history and current situation of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the commune. Therefore, they could not consciously stand on the height of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines to view the struggle-criticism-transformation, and continuously discover new problems and propose new measures to deepen the struggle-criticism-transformation. Everyone realized that as long as they investigated and clarified the history and current situation of the struggle between the two roads in the commune, they could grasp the root cause, hit the vital points, thoroughly expose, and firmly establish. Only by mobilizing and relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants can the history of the struggle between the two roads in the countryside be investigated and clarified.

To investigate and clarify the history of the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, relying on a few people is not enough; the poor and lower-middle peasants must be mobilized to do it. Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is a people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can the war be waged, and only by relying on the people can the war be waged." The poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force for revolution and production in the countryside and the main force for carrying out the struggle-criticism-transformation. They are most familiar with the history and current situation of their own brigade and commune. Mobilizing and relying on them can clarify the history of the struggle between the two roads in the local area. Therefore, the propaganda team and the revolutionary committee members together went deep into various production brigades, extensively promoting the great significance of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on the tasks of each stage of the struggle-criticism-transformation, the great call and requirements of the communiqué to the entire military and people, and the importance of investigating and clarifying the history of the struggle between the two roads in the countryside for carrying out the struggle-criticism-transformation. A team of poor and lower-middle peasants for investigation was quickly organized throughout the commune. They discussed in courtyards, fields, meeting halls, kang beds, and study classes, each using their brains and speaking out, extensively discussing the situation of the struggle between the two roads in their own brigade and village.

To guide the poor and lower-middle peasants to do a better job in the investigation, the propaganda team and the revolutionary committee, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, timely summarized the experience of investigating the history of the struggle between the two roads in the countryside. Their experience included: studying Chairman Mao's consistent teachings on the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the countryside; discussing the main manifestations of the struggle between the two roads in the four periods of land reform, cooperativization, people's commune, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution since liberation; using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to analyze the issues investigated, distinguishing the line between socialism and capitalism, and distinguishing which existing regulations and systems are in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought and which are not. Based on the results of the investigation and analysis, they linked the revisionist things to Liu Shaoqi and used them as living teaching materials to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. These experiences were promoted in the commune's fifteen brigades, and the poor and lower-middle peasants' investigation of the history of the struggle between the two roads became more extensive and in-depth.

The Pingfeng Brigade was originally one of the brigades in the commune where the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines was relatively intense. Where was the problem? The commune's revolutionary committee had not clarified this before. This time, by mobilizing the masses to conduct investigations, the problems were all clarified. The poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade used Chairman Mao's teaching that "only socialism can save China" to compare it with the history and current situation of their brigade. They first listed five major issues: (1) Why did the collective cultivated land in the entire brigade decrease by more than five hundred mu from 1956 to 1965? (2) Why were there more privately raised draft animals than collective draft animals? (3) Why did some people not participate in collective production for a long time and go out to do odd jobs to earn money for themselves, and no one managed them? (4) Why was the black wind of Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "self-reliance and contract responsibility system" so strong in this brigade? (5) Why were six poor and lower-middle peasant cadres who followed Chairman Mao's instructions firmly and walked the socialist road suppressed and expelled? Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they used the class and class struggle perspective and class analysis method to view and analyze everything, and conducted specific analysis and research on these major issues one by one. They discovered that these problems were all closely related to the former brigade party branch secretary. They followed the clue and finally exposed that this person was a bad element who had fled from another place in 1948 and impersonated a veteran soldier. After seizing the position of brigade party branch secretary in 1956, he faithfully executed Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Whatever Liu Shaoqi shouted from above, he jumped accordingly below, vigorously promoting capitalist restoration. Liu Shaoqi shouted "contract production to households," and he promoted "small contract work," dividing more than five hundred mu of land into small plots for villagers to cultivate. Liu Shaoqi's agent in Northeast China shouted "downsize some livestock to individuals for private raising, with many benefits and no development of capitalism," and he immediately sold forty collective draft animals to villagers for private raising.

Based on the shocking facts investigated, the poor and lower-middle peasants carried out a revolutionary criticism of the great traitor, great spy, and great renegade Liu Shaoqi and his agent in this brigade. They also proposed reform plans for unreasonable regulations and systems. In the past, a group of cadres who were suppressed and expelled were found to be loyal to Chairman Mao during the investigation, and they were re-elected to participate in the leadership teams at various levels.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The experience of history is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The fact that the poor and lower-middle peasants in Nadanber Commune investigated the history of the struggle between the two roads fully proves that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are extremely wise and correct. The poor and lower-middle peasants continuously raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

The struggle-criticism-transformation has reached a new high tide.

The Nadanber People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, relying on and mobilizing the poor and lower-middle peasants to investigate the history of the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, has made the broad poor and lower-middle peasants distinguish between what is the socialist road and what is the capitalist road. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: Now we can clearly distinguish between the red line and the black line. We know what to struggle against, what to criticize, and what to transform. Many production brigades have compiled the history of the struggle between the two roads investigated into brigade histories, village histories, and family histories as living teaching materials for the struggle between the two lines. They recalled the situations of several important turning points in the development of socialist agriculture over the past twenty-one years. They looked at what Chairman Mao advocated and opposed, how Liu Shaoqi sabotaged and destroyed, how the local capitalist-roaders followed the black masters to shout slogans, and how the poor and lower-middle peasants firmly followed Chairman Mao to revolutionize despite the adverse winds and waves.

The poor and lower-middle peasants have raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and the enthusiasm for struggle-criticism-transformation has reached an unprecedented height. They use Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to measure, distinguish, criticize, and transform everything, and reform anything that does not conform to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Now, the entire commune has abolished the system of "piecework points" and "bonus points," implementing the political-oriented management system of Dazhai; the past eighteen craftsmen who secretly practiced individual farming, such as carpenters, blacksmiths, bricklayers, barbers, and tailors, have been reorganized and are now managed by the brigade and commune. The commune's revolutionary committee has implemented "streamlining and downsizing," with more than twenty cadres sent down to labor, and the style of the office has undergone great changes, receiving praise from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

With the arrival of the high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation, Nadanber Commune's production has entered a new leap-forward situation. Every household in the entire commune has no idle people, and men, women, and children all work full shifts. They have built nearly one thousand mu of terraced fields and accumulated fifteen million tons of fertilizer. The poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: Investigation and research are good. The awareness of the struggle between the two lines has been greatly raised, the struggle-criticism-transformation has reached a new high tide, and the revolution and production have presented a new situation.

    发动贫下中农调查两条路线斗争历史
    紧密联系实际深入开展路线斗争教育
    那丹伯公社革委会在解放军帮助下，用本地区的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争史教育群众，有力地推动了全公社斗批改的深入开展
    本报讯　吉林省东丰县那丹伯公社革委会在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”和“把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导，以党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报为武器，放手发动和坚决依靠贫下中农调查农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争史，使全公社的斗批改群众运动，出现了一个波澜壮阔的新局面。调查农村两条路线斗争史是深入进行斗批改的向导
    那丹伯公社革委会成立后，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，狠抓了全公社的斗批改。但是，在取得了一定成绩之后，有的委员产生了“差不多”的思想。就在这个时候，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了，解放军宣传队立即帮助公社革委会，带着这个问题举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们对照公报检查了全公社斗批改的情况，使大家认识到，不是斗批改搞得“差不多了”，而是离公报的要求差得很远。怎样才能把斗批改步步引向深入呢？他们带着这个问题，听取了那丹伯大队革委会的经验介绍。这个大队一年多没有搞清的老大难问题，通过调查本大队两条道路斗争的历史，很快就把问题弄清了，从而使这个大队的斗批改蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    公社革委会的同志从那丹伯大队的经验中，深深地认识到，当前斗批改深入不下去的一个重要原因，就是自己对本公社两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史和现状不了解，因而，就不可能自觉地站到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度上来看斗批改，并不断发现新问题，提出新措施，把斗批改引向深入。大家认识到，只要把本公社两条道路斗争的历史和现状调查清楚，就能抓住根本，打中要害，破得彻底，立得牢固。只有发动和依靠贫下中农才能调查清楚农村两条道路斗争史
    要把农村两条道路斗争史调查清楚，只靠少数人不行，必须发动贫下中农都来搞。毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”贫下中农是农村中革命和生产的主力军，也是搞好斗批改的主力军，他们对本队本社的历史和现状最熟悉，发动和依靠他们，就能把本地的两条道路斗争史调查清楚。于是，宣传队和革委会的同志一起，深入到各生产队大讲实现毛主席提出的关于斗批改各阶段的任务的伟大意义，大讲公报对全国军民发出的伟大号召和要求，大讲调查清楚农村两条道路斗争史对搞好斗批改的重要性，全公社一支贫下中农调查队伍很快组织起来。他们在场院、地头、会场、炕头、学习班里，个个动脑，人人开口，大摆大谈本队本屯两条道路斗争的情况。
    为了引导贫下中农把调查搞得更好，宣传队和革委会同贫下中农一起，及时总结了调查农村两条道路斗争史的经验。他们的经验是：学习毛主席关于农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一贯教导；摆解放以来，土改、合作化、人民公社化和无产阶级文化大革命四个时期中，两条道路斗争的主要表现；以毛泽东思想为武器，把调查出来的问题，进行阶级分析，分清社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的界线，分清现有规章制度哪些是符合毛泽东思想的，哪些是不符合毛泽东思想的。根据调查分析结果，对修正主义的东西都上联刘少奇，下对活教材，深入开展革命大批判。这些经验在公社十五个大队推广后，贫下中农调查两条道路斗争史的活动更加广泛深入了。
    屏风大队原是全公社两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争比较激烈的一个大队。问题在那里呢？过去，公社革委会一直未搞清。这回发动群众搞调查，结果都一一查清了。这个大队的贫下中农用毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的教导，对照本大队的历史和现状，首先摆出了五件大事：（1）全大队集体耕地，为什么从一九五六年到一九六五年，少了五百多亩？（2）为什么私养的耕牛比集体耕牛多？（3）有的人长期不参加集体生产，到外面干零活为个人挣钱，为什么没人管？（4）刘少奇鼓吹的“三自一包”黑风，为什么在本大队刮得这么厉害？（5）有六个紧跟毛主席坚决走社会主义道路的贫下中农干部，为什么被打击排斥下去？接着，按照毛主席的教导，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法去看待一切、分析一切，对这一件件大事逐一进行具体分析研究，发现这些问题都和原大队党支部书记有密切联系。他们就顺蔓抠根，终于查出了这个家伙是一九四八年从外地跑来，冒充荣誉军人的坏分子。一九五六年他窃取大队党支部书记职务后，就忠实地执行刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。刘少奇在上面怎么叫，他就在下面怎么跳，大搞资本主义复辟。刘少奇叫嚷“包产到户”，他就大搞“小包工”，五百多亩地分给社员种小片荒。刘少奇在东北的代理人叫嚷“下放点牲畜给个人私养，好处很多，不会发展资本主义”，他一下子就把四十头集体耕牛卖给社员私养。
    贫下中农根据调查来的这些触目惊心的事实，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其在本大队的代理人开展了革命大批判。并对不合理的规章制度提出了改革的方案。过去有一批被排斥打下去的干部，贫下中农在调查中发现他们是忠于毛主席的好干部，又重新把他们选上来，参加各级领导班子。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”那丹伯公社广大贫下中农调查两条道路斗争史的事实，充分证明了毛主席这一最新指示是无比英明，无比正确的。贫下中农不断提高路线斗争觉悟
    斗批改出现新高潮
    那丹伯公社革委会依靠和发动贫下中农调查农村两条道路的斗争史，使广大的贫下中农分清了什么是社会主义道路，什么是资本主义道路。贫下中农们说：这下子咱们对红线黑线分得清了，斗什么，批什么，改什么，心里可亮堂啦！许多生产队，把调查出来的两条道路斗争史，编写成队史、村史、家史，作为进行两条路线斗争的活教材。他们回忆了二十一年来社会主义农业发展的几个重要关头的情况。看看毛主席提倡的是什么，反对的是什么，刘少奇是怎样捣乱破坏的，本地区的走资派是怎样跟着黑主子摇旗呐喊的，贫下中农又是怎样顶逆风战恶浪，坚定地跟着毛主席干革命的。
    贫下中农提高了路线斗争觉悟，斗批改的热情空前高涨。他们用毛主席的革命路线去衡量一切，鉴别一切，批判一切，改造一切，发现凡是不符合毛主席革命路线的东西就进行改革。现在，全公社废除了“计件工分”“奖励工分”的制度，实行了大寨的突出政治的经营管理制度；把过去那些变相搞单干的木匠、铁匠、瓦匠、理发、裁缝等“十八匠”，重新进行了组织，全部归社队统一管理。公社革委会实行了“精兵简政”，二十多名干部下放劳动，机关作风发生了很大的转变，受到了贫下中农的称赞。
    随着斗批改高潮的到来，那丹伯公社生产出现了新的跃进局面，全公社家家户户无闲人，男女老少出满勤，兴修了近一千亩梯田，积了十五万吨粪肥。贫下中农兴奋地说：调查研究就是好，路线斗争觉悟大提高，斗批改掀起了新高潮，革命生产出现了新面貌。
