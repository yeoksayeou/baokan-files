Ten years ago, when the new phenomenon of the people's commune appeared in Qili Camp, Xinxiang County, Henan, a sharp and intense struggle unfolded between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by Liu Shaoqi on the issue of the people's commune.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has the utmost faith in the masses, relies on the masses the most, and supports the masses' spirit of innovation the most. Three days after the establishment of the Qili Camp People's Commune, on August 6, 1958, Chairman Mao personally came to inspect it. Chairman Mao highly praised the people's commune during the inspection and issued the great call to the nation: "The people's commune is good." Chairman Mao's great call was like a thunderclap in spring, echoing throughout the country, giving the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Qili Camp boundless energy to further develop the people's commune. With their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao, they built a memorial hall in the cotton fields where Chairman Mao inspected, letting the red sun's rays forever shine upon Qili Camp. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: The red flag of the people's commune was personally raised by our great leader Chairman Mao. We must hold this red flag higher and higher, all the way to communism.

Just as the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Qili Camp were advancing with the red flag of the people's commune held high, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, were terrified and hated the new people's commune to death. They viciously attacked the people's commune, claiming it was "established too early" and "run poorly," attempting to sabotage the people's commune and restore capitalism. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Qili Camp, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately saw through their tricks and firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, enthusiastically praising the people's commune as good! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: Communism is paradise, and the people's commune is the bridge. They fiercely criticized the reactionary fallacies of a small number of class enemies and resolutely withstood the evil wind.

In the spring of 1961, when our national economy faced temporary difficulties due to consecutive natural disasters, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi sent his black henchmen to Qili Camp under the guise of "democratic management of the commune." They fiercely attacked the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the three red banners of the people's commune, advocating "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms," attempting to drag the socialist collective economy towards the capitalist road. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Qili Camp engaged in a head-to-head struggle with the black henchmen of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. They said: We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will definitely follow the socialist road guided by Chairman Mao, even if it means facing knife mountains and fire seas, we will not turn back, even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble, we will not change our minds. After a fierce struggle, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Qili Camp smashed the evil plots of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his black henchmen, holding the red flag of the people's commune even higher.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Qili Camp People's Commune, tempered in the battles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has shown even greater vitality and unparalleled superiority. The red flag of the people's commune is more vibrant and brilliant. Currently, more than 70% of the arable land in this commune has achieved bumper harvests regardless of drought or flood. The area of mechanized farming has expanded from 25% before the commune was established to 80%. Agricultural production has been bountiful year after year. Over the past ten years, Qili Camp People's Commune has sold 28 million jin of cotton to the state, and public accumulation has increased from over 300,000 yuan before the commune was established to over 770,000 yuan. The living standards of the people have significantly improved. The poor and lower-middle peasants are extremely excited and say: Following the road guided by Chairman Mao is like eating sugarcane while climbing stairs, sweet step by step, higher step by step. We must carry out the class struggle, the struggle between the two roads, and the struggle between the two lines in the countryside to the end, and forever advance along the socialist road guided by our great leader Chairman Mao.

    把人民公社红旗举得更高
    十年前，人民公社这个新生事物在河南新乡县七里营一出现，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，在对待人民公社的问题上，展开了一场尖锐激烈的斗争。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，最支持群众的首创精神。七里营人民公社成立后的第三天，一九五八年八月六日，毛主席就亲自来视察。毛主席在视察中给人民公社以高度赞扬，向全国发出了“人民公社好”的伟大号召。毛主席的这一伟大号召，象一声春雷，响遍了全中国，给七里营广大贫下中农进一步办好人民公社以无穷无尽的力量。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，在毛主席视察过的棉田里建立了纪念馆，让红太阳的光辉永远普照七里营。广大贫下中农说：人民公社这面红旗，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手树立起来的。我们一定要把这面红旗越举越高，一直高举到共产主义。
    正当七里营人民公社广大贫下中农高举人民公社的红旗阔步前进的时候，以叛徒刘少奇为代表的党内一小撮走资派，对新生的人民公社怕得要死，恨得要命，他们恶毒地攻击人民公社“办早了”、“办糟了”，妄图搞垮人民公社，复辟资本主义。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七里营广大贫下中农，一眼就看穿了他们的阴谋诡计，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，热情地赞扬人民公社就是好！广大贫下中农说：共产主义是天堂，人民公社架桥梁。他们狠狠地批判了一小撮阶级敌人的反动谬论，坚决顶住了这股妖风。
    在我国国民经济由于连续遭受自然灾害而暂时遇到困难的一九六一年春天，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇又指使他的黑干将，打着所谓
  “民主办社”的招牌，溜到了七里营，疯狂地攻击党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”，妄图把社会主义集体经济拉向资本主义道路。七里营贫下中农同大叛徒刘少奇的黑干将进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们说：毛主席指引的社会主义大道，我们贫下中农走定了，刀山火海不回头，海枯石烂不变心。经过一场激烈的斗争，七里营广大贫下中农粉碎了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其黑干将的罪恶阴谋，把人民公社的红旗举得更高。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的光辉指引下，经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗锻炼的七里营人民公社，更加显示出它强大的生命力和无比的优越性，人民公社这面红旗更加鲜艳夺目。目前，这个公社已有百分之七十以上的耕地，实现了旱涝保丰收，机耕面积由公社化前的百分之二十五扩大到百分之八十，农业生产年年丰收。十年来，七里营人民公社卖给国家皮棉二千八百多万斤，公共积累由公社化前的三十多万元增加到七百七十多万元，群众生活水平有很大提高。贫下中农无比兴奋地说：走毛主席指引的道路，好比吃甘蔗上楼梯，节节甜，步步高。我们一定要把农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，永远沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的社会主义大道前进。
