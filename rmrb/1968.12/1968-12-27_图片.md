In June of this year, Chinese engineering and technical personnel assisted the people of Yemen in completing a well in the Mamala region, located 20 kilometers from the capital Sana'a. The well, known as the Mamala Well, is 113.84 meters deep and is the only well in this region, which was previously believed to have no groundwater. It not only solved the water supply problem for the Sana'a-Sada highway construction project passing through this region and for the nearby residents, but also prepared the conditions for irrigation. The image shows the people of Yemen rejoicing as the Mamala Well gushes out the long-awaited groundwater. (Xinhua News Agency)

    今年六月，中国工程技术人员帮助也门人民，在离首都萨那二十公里的马马拉地区建成了一口机井——马马拉井，井深达一一三点八四米，是这个过去被认为没有地下水的地区的唯一机井。它不仅解决了为通过这个地区的萨那—萨达公路工程供水和附近居民饮水的问题，而且为灌溉准备了条件。图为也门人民欢呼马马拉机井喷出了渴望已久的地下水。　新华社稿
