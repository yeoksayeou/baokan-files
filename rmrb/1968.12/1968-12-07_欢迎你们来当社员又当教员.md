	Welcome to Become Members and Teachers

	The management of schools by poor and lower-middle peasants is a call from Chairman Mao and also a long-held wish of ours, the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Our production brigade is completely capable of running and managing a school. Some people say that we poor and lower-middle peasants have not studied much and do not know many characters, so we cannot run a school. This is sheer nonsense. We do not understand how to run a revisionist school; but we do understand how to run a school that serves the poor and lower-middle peasants. We also know best who are the successors of the socialist cause. We hate Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line the most, and we understand Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts the best. As for the specific conditions for running a school, our production brigade has people, money, and materials. The teaching materials for the school, apart from textbooks, include the class struggle materials of comparing the old and new societies and the rich production experience, which are not in textbooks but are the most useful. Our brigade's school will definitely be better than a public primary school.

	We welcome public primary school teachers to come to the brigade to be members and teachers. Currently, some teachers are worried that if they work like members and get work points, their lives will be difficult, and some are also worried that it will increase the burden on the poor and lower-middle peasants. These worries are unnecessary. You come to the brigade, teach and work at the same time, and this will only increase production; you teach the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants well, and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants will have more enthusiasm for production, and the yield will be higher. A brigade of poor and lower-middle peasants can easily support seven or eight, or even a dozen teachers. As long as you sincerely serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, if you have difficulties in life, the poor and lower-middle peasants will also take care of you.

	To transfer public primary schools to the brigade for management, with teachers and poor and lower-middle peasants getting work points, not receiving state salaries, and not eating state rations, this is indeed a great revolution for teachers. As long as revolutionary teachers study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, truly arm themselves with Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolutionary line, and firmly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, eliminating the influence of the bourgeoisie's "education for livelihood" ideology, you will definitely achieve a great ideological revolution and become a revolutionary intellectual welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    欢迎你们来当社员又当教员
    贫下中农管理学校，这是毛主席他老人家的号召，也是我们贫下中农多年的愿望。
    我们生产大队完全能办好学校，管好学校。有人说我们贫下中农没有读过书，不识几个字，办不好学校，这完全是胡扯。办修正主义学校的那一套，我们是不懂；办为贫下中农服务的学校，我们就懂。什么样的人是社会主义事业的革命接班人，我们也最明白。我们最恨刘少奇的修正主义教育路线，我们最懂毛主席的教育革命思想。至于办学的各种具体条件，我们生产大队要人有人，要钱有钱，要物有物。学校的教材，除了书本上的，我们还有新旧社会回忆对比的阶级斗争教材和丰富的生产经验，这都是书本上没有的，但这是最有用的。我们大队办学校，一定要比公办小学强。
    我们欢迎公办小学教师到大队来当社员、当教师。现在有的教师担心和社员一样记工分后生活会有困难，有的还担心会增加贫下中农的负担。这些都不用担心。你们到大队来，一边教学，一边参加劳动，只会增加生产；你们把贫下中农子弟教好了，广大贫下中农生产劲头更大，产量会更高。一个大队的贫下中农，担负七八个、十几个教师的生活是不成问题的。只要你们真心实意为贫下中农服务，如果你们生活有困难，贫下中农也会照顾的。
    把公办小学下放到大队来办，教师和贫下中农一样记工分，不拿国家工资，不吃国家口粮，这对教师确实是一个大革命。只要革命的教师活学活用毛主席著作，彻底批判刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线，真正用毛主席的无产阶级教育革命路线武装自己，坚定不移地为贫下中农服务，清除“教育为活命”的资产阶级思想影响，你们就一定能实现思想大革命，成为一个贫下中农所欢迎的革命知识分子。
  上海金山县红星大队党支部书记　徐忠铭
