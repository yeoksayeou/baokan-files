The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Taikang County, Henan Province, with deep feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have repeatedly studied the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. They indignantly denounce the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's heinous crime of severely reducing agricultural cooperatives in 1955. From the county to the commune and production brigades, criticism meetings have been held, pushing the revolutionary criticism to a new high.

After the land reform, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Taikang County, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "organizing together," rapidly launched the agricultural collectivization movement throughout the county. At this critical moment, the traitor Liu Shaoqi, in order to oppose Chairman Mao's socialist collectivization line, came up with the so-called "severely reducing agricultural cooperatives." At that time, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee, wielding Liu Shaoqi's black axe, used excuses such as "weak foundation," "backward masses," and "too early and too many" to chop down most of the cooperatives, leaving only 217, with cooperative members accounting for only 3.4% of the total households in the county. This became the black model of severely reducing agricultural cooperatives in the province.

Comrade Fu Baoshun, a member of the county poor peasants' association and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: "In 1955, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee, following Liu Shaoqi's black directives, severely reduced the cooperatives and promoted 'experiences of reducing cooperatives' and 'models of reducing cooperatives.' They also called for party members to take the lead in withdrawing from the cooperatives. At that time, many poor and lower-middle peasants withdrew from the cooperatives with tears in their eyes. This greatly dampened our poor and lower-middle peasants' enthusiasm for the collectivization path. This is a blood debt owed by the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, who attempted to use a soft knife to harm the poor and lower-middle peasants." Li Haoyi, the director of the revolutionary committee of Dalugang Brigade, Banqiao Commune, exposed: "After the black directives of the big scoundrel Liu Shaoqi came down, the five agricultural cooperatives set up in Dalugang Village were chopped down to three and a half. I was the director of the half cooperative that was chopped down. At that time, the number of cooperative households in the village decreased from over a hundred to over thirty. Our cooperative originally had 17 households, but 10 were chopped down. The remaining seven poor and lower-middle peasants, fearing further reduction, told the higher authorities that we were a mutual aid team, but secretly we were still a cooperative. As a result, the grain crops we planted collectively yielded more than double the amount of those who withdrew and farmed individually. We collectively turned in over 10,000 jin of grain, averaging over 2,000 jin per household. The 10 households forced to farm individually did not complete the state's procurement task."

Due to the big scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's severe reduction of agricultural cooperatives and his frenzied opposition to the development of the collectivization movement, capitalist spontaneous forces in the countryside ran rampant, exacerbating the polarization between the rich and the poor. The poor peasant representative from the old Gaolang Brigade, Gaolang Commune, exposed: After the cooperatives were chopped down, the poor and lower-middle peasants, having just been liberated, had weak foundations, poor livestock, and poor land cultivation. Soon, phenomena such as selling land, borrowing money, and hiring labor emerged. According to a typical survey of 33 villages at that time, out of 2,263 peasant households, 353 were re-exploited (most of whom were poor and lower-middle peasants), accounting for 15% of the total households. Among them, 68 households sold land, 183 borrowed money, 6 hired labor, and 104 sold livestock and farm tools. This clearly exposed Liu Shaoqi's evil intention of severely reducing cooperatives, which was to make the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice and restore capitalism in the countryside.

Great leader Chairman Mao has always supported the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants always follow Chairman Mao's words. After Chairman Mao's great work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" was published in July 1955, the poor and lower-middle peasants were all overjoyed and spread the news. The county saw a new wave of the collectivization movement. In just over three months, most of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the county joined the cooperatives.

Comrade Yao Zongting, the director of the revolutionary committee of Qianhe Brigade, Changying Commune, said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly follow the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao. The cooperatives that were chopped down by two-thirds developed and grew stronger. Later, people's communes were established, high-voltage lines were erected, and electric irrigation stations were built. Grain and cotton production increased year by year, and the living standards of the commune members improved year by year. Now, the grain yield is more than double that of the time of agricultural collectivization. Every brigade has reserve grain, and most commune members have savings at home. The collective economy is becoming more and more consolidated and strong. These victories were achieved because the great leader Chairman Mao timely and wisely foiled Liu Shaoqi's plot to severely reduce cooperatives. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Through the revolutionary criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Taikang County have further heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They are determined to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively respond to the call of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. They will further deepen the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts, and turn the people's communes into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

    河南省太康县贫下中农和革命干部
    愤怒声讨刘少奇大砍合作社的滔天罪行
    河南太康县的广大贫下中农和革命干部，怀着对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚感情，反复学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报，愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇一九五五年大砍农业合作社的滔天罪行。从县、公社到生产大队都召开了批判大会，使革命的大批判推向了一个新的高潮。
    土地改革以后，太康县广大贫下中农，遵照毛主席“组织起来”的伟大教导，在全县迅速地开展了农业合作化运动。正当这个时候，叛徒刘少奇为了反对毛主席的社会主义合作化路线，就来了一个所谓“大砍农业合作社”。当时旧县委内一小撮走资派，抡起刘少奇的黑斧子，以“基础差”“群众落后”“搞早了，搞多了”等为借口，砍掉了大部分合作社，剩下来的只有二百一十七个，入社农户只占全县总户数的百分之三点四，成了全省大砍农业合作社的黑典型。
    县贫代会委员、活学活用毛主席著作积极分子傅保顺说：“一九五五年，旧县委内一小撮走资派按照刘少奇的黑指示，大砍合作社，大搞‘砍社经验’，大树
  ‘砍社样板’，并且号召党员带头退社。当时，不少贫下中农含着眼泪退出合作社。这就极大地打击了我们贫下中农走合作化道路的积极性。这是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇企图用软刀子杀害贫下中农的一笔血债。”板桥公社大陆岗大队革命委员会主任李好义揭发：“在大坏蛋刘少奇的黑指示下来以后，大陆岗村办起来的五个农业合作社被砍掉了三个半，我就是被砍掉的那半个合作社的社长。当时，全村入社农户由一百多户减少到三十多户。我们那个合作社原有十七户，被砍掉了十户。我们剩下来的七户贫下中农，唯恐再被砍掉，就对上说是互助组，暗地里还是合作社。结果，我们集体播种的粮食作物产量比退社后单干的高出一倍多，集体上交一万多斤粮食，每户平均两千多斤。而被迫单干的十户，没有完成国家征购任务。”
    由于刘少奇这个大坏蛋大砍农业合作社，疯狂反对合作化运动的发展，使农村资本主义自发势力自由泛滥，助长了两极分化。高朗公社旧高朗大队被强迫退社的贫农代表揭发：合作社被砍掉以后，贫下中农因为刚翻身，家底薄，耕畜弱，土地耕种得不好，不久就出现了卖地、借债、当雇工的现象。据当时三十三个村的典型调查，在二千二百六十三户农民中，重新受剥削的达三百五十三户（大部分是贫下中农），占总户数的百分之十五。其中卖地的六十八户，借债的一百八十三户，当雇工的六户，卖牲畜和农具的一百零四户。这明显地暴露出刘少奇大砍合作社的罪恶目的，就是要使贫下中农受二茬罪，在农村复辟资本主义。
    伟大领袖毛主席最支持贫下中农。贫下中农最听毛主席的话。一九五五年七月，毛主席的伟大著作《关于农业合作化问题》发表以后，贫下中农无不欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，全县又出现了一个新的合作化运动高潮。仅三个多月的时间，全县大部分贫下中农都入了社。
    常营公社前河大队革命委员会主任姚宗廷说：“我们贫下中农坚决按照毛主席他老人家指引的社会主义大道前进，被砍掉三分之二的合作社又发展壮大起来。以后，又办起了人民公社，架上了高压线，建起了电灌站，粮食棉花年年增产，社员生活年年提高。现在的粮食产量，比农业合作化时增加两倍多，队队有贮备粮，大部分社员家中有存款，集体经济越来越巩固壮大。这些胜利的取得，是由于伟大领袖毛主席英明地及时地粉碎了刘少奇大砍合作社的阴谋。这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。”
    太康县贫下中农和革命干部通过革命大批判，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极响应党的八届十二中全会公报的号召，彻底批深批臭刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义黑货。要进一步深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，把人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
