The workers' correspondents and reporters stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory report: The broad revolutionary workers and the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory, in conjunction with the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, have earnestly summarized the factory's experience in defending and implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have used these experiences to guide the current movement and accelerated the pace of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

During the high tide of studying, propagating, and implementing the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the brilliant report made by the great leader Chairman Mao at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee was reissued, greatly inspiring the broad revolutionary workers and support-left personnel. The entire factory immediately launched a movement to study the history of the two-line struggle within the Party. From the revolutionary committee of the factory and the support-left personnel to the workers in each brigade (workshop), they held discussion meetings, experience-sharing meetings, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with everyone discussing experiences, lessons, and gaps. Through study and summary, everyone deepened their understanding in the following aspects:

	Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful
	ideological weapon for conducting the
	struggle between the two lines, and
	studying and applying it in practice is the
	fundamental way to improve awareness
	of the struggle between the two lines.

Looking back on the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers and the support-left personnel stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory deeply felt that the history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the history of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and overthrowing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. In this struggle, Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions and consistent teachings are our most powerful ideological weapons for victory. Seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, deeply understanding Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, can effectively improve the awareness of the struggle between the two lines and be invincible in the struggle between the two lines. In the early stages of the movement, some rebellious workers who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" by Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line said at the summary meeting: "With Chairman Mao's 'Bombard the Headquarters' big-character poster and a series of latest instructions as guidance, there was the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and there is our everything today as the proletarian revolutionary faction." Everyone recalled the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deeply felt: "Every victory we have achieved is the result of Chairman Mao's instructions. Deviating from Chairman Mao's instructions leads to mistakes, and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions leads to victory." The support-left personnel summarized their experiences and said: "Every time we seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions, we become clear-headed and speak with principles, act with methods, and the situation of the struggle develops smoothly; every time we do not study Chairman Mao's instructions enough and do not understand them deeply, we are like losing our mainstay, speak ineffectively, act ineffectively, and the situation of the struggle develops slowly or even suffers setbacks." The factory revolutionary committee also summarized the experience of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions based on a year of leading the revolutionary workers of the entire factory in the struggle between the two lines.

Through the summary, everyone further improved their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. Now, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory are earnestly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "the experience of history is worth noting" and enthusiastically praising the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The workers in each brigade also summarized their experiences and insights on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice, selected active participants in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and promoted their advanced experiences, quickly launching a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line
	is developed in the struggle against the
	bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry the
	Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through
	to the end, it is necessary to deeply and
	persistently carry out the revolutionary
	criticism.

In the study classes, the broad revolutionary workers, in conjunction with their practice in the struggle between the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, discussed the importance of carrying out revolutionary criticism. At the beginning of the rectification of the Party, a few Party members, influenced by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building the Party, advocated closing the doors for rectification. The rectification leading group of the factory revolutionary committee, in response to this situation, timely organized revolutionary criticism, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's spread of the "theory of the backwardness of the masses," unified understanding, and implemented open-door rectification. However, when it came to developing new Party members, a few Party members said: "During rectification, the doors can be widely open, but for developing new Party members, the doors can only be slightly open." In response to this situation, the rectification leading group of the factory revolutionary committee once again mobilized the entire factory's Party members and masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building the Party, firmly establish Mao Zedong's proletarian line of building the Party, firmly believe in the masses, mobilize the masses extensively, directly rely on the masses, and do a good job of Party-building work quickly and well.

Through the summary, everyone further improved their understanding of revolutionary criticism. The workers pointed out: Although Liu Shaoqi has been permanently expelled from the Party, the poison of his revisionism has not been completely eliminated, and it is necessary to continue to carry out revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary workers put Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods on display, criticize them in the teams, criticize them in the study classes, criticize them in the factory, and criticize them at home, with everyone participating in the battle, verbally and in writing, making revolutionary criticism appear in a new high tide, and powerfully promoting the deep development of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	Seriously implementing the Party's policies and
	guidelines, and successfully carrying out struggle,
	criticism, and transformation.

The revolutionary workers of the Fifth Brigade gave an example in the discussion meeting: They had a leader of the rebellious faction in their brigade who made some mistakes because of strong bourgeois factionalism. A few comrades could not correctly handle his case, confusing the two types of different contradictions, affecting the healthy development of the movement. Later, they studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and handled the matter according to the Party's policies, and the problem was solved. In the study class, the revolutionary workers also said: The work of cleaning up the class ranks in our factory was able to accurately and forcefully strike a small handful of class enemies because the factory revolutionary committee seriously implemented Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two types of different contradictions and seriously implemented Chairman Mao's series of policies and guidelines on fighting against the enemy. The workers, based on their struggle practice, deeply felt: "Implementing the Party's policies, the movement proceeds smoothly; deviating from the Party's policies, the movement suffers setbacks." In studying the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, the revolutionary workers of the Knitting Factory reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching on "policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the Party" and improved their awareness of consciously implementing the guidelines formulated based on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They combined struggle, criticism, and transformation, earnestly studied the Party's relevant policies and guidelines, and checked their work: Which parts conform to the policies? Which parts do not conform to the policies? Those that do not conform were quickly corrected.

	Only by breaking down the self and establishing the public
	can one firmly defend and loyally implement
	Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Looking back on the more than two years of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers realized that implementing which line is essentially using which worldview to transform the world. The proletarian worldview is the ideological foundation for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; the bourgeois worldview is the ideological root of accepting and implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by breaking down the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public" can one firmly defend and loyally implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A mass who once stood on the wrong side in the early stages of the movement said after studying: "In the fierce struggle between the two lines, the public and the self are incompatible. The more 'self' there is, the farther away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; the more 'public' there is, the closer to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If the 'self' is not swept out of the door, one will stumble in the struggle between the two lines!"

At the summary meeting, everyone unanimously pointed out that struggle, criticism, and transformation are the continuation of the struggle between the two lines. The deeper the revolution develops, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two lines becomes, and the more acute the contradiction between the public and the self becomes, the more necessary it is to break down the self and establish the public. Therefore, the factory revolutionary committee and many brigades held study classes on fighting the self and criticizing revisionism to solve the active thoughts of the workers in struggle, criticism, and transformation. The entire factory also held a conference to exchange experiences of good brigades, introducing and promoting the experience of emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the four firsts, and focusing on active thoughts in struggle, criticism, and transformation.
