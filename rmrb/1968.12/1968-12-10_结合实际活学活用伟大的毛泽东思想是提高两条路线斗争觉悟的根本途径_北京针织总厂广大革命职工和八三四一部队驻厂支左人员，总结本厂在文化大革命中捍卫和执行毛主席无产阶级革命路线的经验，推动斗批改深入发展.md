The workers' correspondents and reporters stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory report: The broad revolutionary workers and the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory, in conjunction with the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, have earnestly summarized the factory's experience in defending and implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have used these experiences to guide the current movement and accelerated the pace of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

During the high tide of studying, propagating, and implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the brilliant report made by the great leader Chairman Mao at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee was reissued, greatly inspiring the broad revolutionary workers and support-left personnel. The entire factory immediately launched a movement to study the history of the two-line struggle within the Party. From the revolutionary committee of the factory and the support-left personnel to the workers in each brigade (workshop), they held discussion meetings, experience-sharing meetings, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with everyone discussing experiences, lessons, and gaps. Through study and summary, everyone deepened their understanding in the following aspects:

	Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful
	ideological weapon for conducting the
	struggle between the two lines, and
	studying and applying it in practice is the
	fundamental way to improve awareness
	of the struggle between the two lines.

Looking back on the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers and the support-left personnel stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory deeply felt that the history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the history of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and overthrowing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. In this struggle, Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions and consistent teachings are our most powerful ideological weapons for victory. Seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, deeply understanding Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, can effectively improve the awareness of the struggle between the two lines and be invincible in the struggle between the two lines. In the early stages of the movement, some rebellious workers who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" by Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line said at the summary meeting: "With Chairman Mao's 'Bombard the Headquarters' big-character poster and a series of latest instructions as guidance, there was the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and there is our everything today as the proletarian revolutionary faction." Everyone recalled the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deeply felt: "Every victory we have achieved is the result of Chairman Mao's instructions. Deviating from Chairman Mao's instructions leads to mistakes, and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions leads to victory." The support-left personnel summarized their experiences and said: "Every time we seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions, we become clear-headed and speak with principles, act with methods, and the situation of the struggle develops smoothly; every time we do not study Chairman Mao's instructions enough and do not understand them deeply, we are like losing our mainstay, speak ineffectively, act ineffectively, and the situation of the struggle develops slowly or even suffers setbacks." The factory revolutionary committee also summarized the experience of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions based on a year of leading the revolutionary workers of the entire factory in the struggle between the two lines.

Through the summary, everyone further improved their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. Now, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory are earnestly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "the experience of history is worth noting" and enthusiastically praising the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The workers in each brigade also summarized their experiences and insights on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice, selected active participants in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and promoted their advanced experiences, quickly launching a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line
	is developed in the struggle against the
	bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry the
	Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through
	to the end, it is necessary to deeply and
	persistently carry out the revolutionary
	criticism.

In the study classes, the broad revolutionary workers, in conjunction with their practice in the struggle between the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, discussed the importance of carrying out revolutionary criticism. At the beginning of the rectification of the Party, a few Party members, influenced by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building the Party, advocated closing the doors for rectification. The rectification leading group of the factory revolutionary committee, in response to this situation, timely organized revolutionary criticism, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's spread of the "theory of the backwardness of the masses," unified understanding, and implemented open-door rectification. However, when it came to developing new Party members, a few Party members said: "During rectification, the doors can be widely open, but for developing new Party members, the doors can only be slightly open." In response to this situation, the rectification leading group of the factory revolutionary committee once again mobilized the entire factory's Party members and masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building the Party, firmly establish Mao Zedong's proletarian line of building the Party, firmly believe in the masses, mobilize the masses extensively, directly rely on the masses, and do a good job of Party-building work quickly and well.

Through the summary, everyone further improved their understanding of revolutionary criticism. The workers pointed out: Although Liu Shaoqi has been permanently expelled from the Party, the poison of his revisionism has not been completely eliminated, and it is necessary to continue to carry out revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary workers put Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods on display, criticize them in the teams, criticize them in the study classes, criticize them in the factory, and criticize them at home, with everyone participating in the battle, verbally and in writing, making revolutionary criticism appear in a new high tide, and powerfully promoting the deep development of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	Seriously implementing the Party's policies and
	guidelines, and successfully carrying out struggle,
	criticism, and transformation.

The revolutionary workers of the Fifth Brigade gave an example in the discussion meeting: They had a leader of the rebellious faction in their brigade who made some mistakes because of strong bourgeois factionalism. A few comrades could not correctly handle his case, confusing the two types of different contradictions, affecting the healthy development of the movement. Later, they studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and handled the matter according to the Party's policies, and the problem was solved. In the study class, the revolutionary workers also said: The work of cleaning up the class ranks in our factory was able to accurately and forcefully strike a small handful of class enemies because the factory revolutionary committee seriously implemented Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two types of different contradictions and seriously implemented Chairman Mao's series of policies and guidelines on fighting against the enemy. The workers, based on their struggle practice, deeply felt: "Implementing the Party's policies, the movement proceeds smoothly; deviating from the Party's policies, the movement suffers setbacks." In studying the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, the revolutionary workers of the Knitting Factory reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching on "policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the Party" and improved their awareness of consciously implementing the guidelines formulated based on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They combined struggle, criticism, and transformation, earnestly studied the Party's relevant policies and guidelines, and checked their work: Which parts conform to the policies? Which parts do not conform to the policies? Those that do not conform were quickly corrected.

	Only by breaking down the self and establishing the public
	can one firmly defend and loyally implement
	Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Looking back on the more than two years of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers realized that implementing which line is essentially using which worldview to transform the world. The proletarian worldview is the ideological foundation for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; the bourgeois worldview is the ideological root of accepting and implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by breaking down the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public" can one firmly defend and loyally implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A mass who once stood on the wrong side in the early stages of the movement said after studying: "In the fierce struggle between the two lines, the public and the self are incompatible. The more 'self' there is, the farther away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; the more 'public' there is, the closer to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If the 'self' is not swept out of the door, one will stumble in the struggle between the two lines!"

At the summary meeting, everyone unanimously pointed out that struggle, criticism, and transformation are the continuation of the struggle between the two lines. The deeper the revolution develops, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two lines becomes, and the more acute the contradiction between the public and the self becomes, the more necessary it is to break down the self and establish the public. Therefore, the factory revolutionary committee and many brigades held study classes on fighting the self and criticizing revisionism to solve the active thoughts of the workers in struggle, criticism, and transformation. The entire factory also held a conference to exchange experiences of good brigades, introducing and promoting the experience of emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the four firsts, and focusing on active thoughts in struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    结合实际活学活用伟大的毛泽东思想是提高两条路线斗争觉悟的根本途径
    北京针织总厂广大革命职工和八三四一部队驻厂支左人员，总结本厂在文化大革命中捍卫和执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的经验，推动斗批改深入发展
    据新华社九日讯　北京针织总厂工人通讯员和驻厂记者报道：北京针织总厂广大革命职工和人民解放军八三四一部队驻厂支左人员，结合学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，认真总结本厂在无产阶级文化大革命中捍卫和执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的经验，运用这些经验指导当前的运动，加快了斗、批、改的步伐。
    在学习、宣传、执行党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的高潮中，重新发表了伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的光辉报告，极大地鼓舞了广大革命职工和支左人员，全厂立即掀起了党内两条路线斗争史的学习运动。从厂革委会、支左人员到各连队（车间）工人，纷纷举行座谈会、讲用会和开办毛泽东思想学习班，人人谈经验，议教训，找差距。通过学习和总结，大家提高了以下几方面的认识：
        毛主席的最新指示和一贯教导是
    进行两条路线斗争的最强大的思想武
    器，活学活用毛泽东思想是提高两条
    路线斗争觉悟的根本途径
    回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，北京针织总厂广大革命职工和驻厂支左人员深深体会到，无产阶级文化大革命的历史，就是亿万革命人民学习和掌握毛泽东思想，坚定地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，去摧毁叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇资产阶级反动路线的历史。在这场斗争中，毛主席的一系列极其重要的最新指示和一贯教导，是我们夺取胜利的最强大的思想武器。认真学习和坚决执行毛主席的指示，深刻领会毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，就能有效地提高两条路线斗争觉悟，就能在两条路线斗争中无往不胜。运动初期被刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线打成“反革命”的一些造反派工人，在总结会上说：“有了毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和一系列最新指示的指引，才有了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，才有了我们无产阶级革命派今天的一切。”大家回顾了无产阶级文化大革命中两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争，深有感触地说：“我们所取得的每一个胜利，都是毛主席指示指引的结果。背离毛主席的指示，就要犯错误，落实毛主席的指示，就取得胜利。”驻厂支左人员在总结中深有体会地说：“每当我们对毛主席的指示认真学习、深刻领会的时候，就心明眼亮，说话有纲，办事有方，斗争形势的发展就顺利；每当我们对毛主席的指示学习不够、领会不深的时候，就好象缺了主心骨，说话不灵，办事不成，斗争形势的发展就缓慢甚至遭受挫折。”厂革命委员会也根据一年来领导全厂革命职工进行两条路线斗争的实践，总结了落实毛主席最新指示的经验。
    通过总结，进一步提高了大家贯彻执行毛主席最新指示，活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性。现在，全厂革命职工认真学习毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意”的最新指示，热烈赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。各连队工人还纷纷总结活学活用毛泽东思想的心得体会，评选活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，推广他们的先进经验，迅速掀起了一个活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。
      毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是在
    同资产阶级反动路线的斗争中发展起
    来的，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行
    到底必须深入持久地开展革命大批判
    在学习班上，广大革命职工结合自己在无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线斗争的实践，谈到了开展革命大批判的重要意义。在整党开始时，有少数党员受刘少奇反革命修正主义建党路线的影响，主张关门整党。厂革命委员会整党领导小组针对这种情况，及时地组织了革命大批判，狠批刘少奇散布的“群众落后论”，统一了认识，实行了开门整党。但是，到发展新党员时，又有个别的党员说：“整党时可以大开门，发展新党员只能小开门。”针对这种情况，厂革命委员会整党领导小组再次发动全厂党员和群众，开展革命大批判，大破刘少奇的反革命修正主义建党路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，坚定地相信群众，放手发动群众，直接依靠群众，把建党工作做得又快又好。
    通过总结，进一步提高了大家对革命大批判的认识。工人们指出：刘少奇虽然被永远开除出党了，但他散布的修正主义毒素还没有彻底肃清，必须继续开展革命大批判。革命职工们把刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义黑货摆出来，班组里批，学习班批，厂里批，家里也批，人人参加战斗，口诛笔伐，使革命大批判出现了一个新高潮，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    认真执行党的方针政策，胜利进行斗、批、改
    五连革命职工在座谈会上举出了这样一个例子：他们连有个造反派的头头，因为资产阶级派性比较强，犯了一些错误。有个别同志不能正确对待他，混淆了两类不同性质的矛盾，影响了运动的健康进行。后来他们学习了毛主席的有关教导，按照党的政策办事，问题解决了。在学习班上，革命职工们还说：我们厂清理阶级队伍的工作，所以能做到稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，是因为厂革委会认真执行了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的教导，认真落实了毛主席关于对敌斗争的一系列方针政策。工人们根据斗争实践深有体会地说：“执行党的政策，运动就顺利前进；背离党的政策，运动就遭受挫折。”在学习党内两条路线斗争史时，针织总厂革命职工们重温了毛主席关于“政策和策略是党的生命”的伟大教导，提高了认真执行根据毛主席的无产阶级革命路线制定的方针的自觉性。他们结合斗、批、改，认真学习了党的有关方针政策，对工作进行了检查：哪些符合政策？哪些不符合政策？不符合的就迅速改正。
      只有破私立公，才能坚定地捍卫和
  忠实执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，广大革命职工认识到，执行什么路线，实质上就是用什么样的世界观改造世界。无产阶级的世界观，是执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的思想基础；资产阶级的世界观，是接受和执行资产阶级反动路线的思想根源。只有破资产阶级的“私”字，立无产阶级的“公”字，才能坚定地捍卫和忠实执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。运动初期一度站错队的群众学习以后深有体会地说：“在激烈的两条路线斗争中，公和私是水火不相容的。‘私’字越多，离毛主席革命路线越远，‘公’字越多，对毛主席革命路线越亲。‘私’字不扫地出门，就要在两条路线斗争中栽斤斗！”
    在总结会上，大家一致指出，斗、批、改是两条路线斗争的继续。革命越深入发展，两条路线的斗争越复杂、深刻，公和私的矛盾越尖锐，也就越要破私立公。因此厂革委会和许多连队都举办了斗私批修学习班，解决职工在斗、批、改中出现的活思想。全厂还召开了四好连队经验交流大会，介绍和推广在斗、批、改中突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大抓活思想的经验。
