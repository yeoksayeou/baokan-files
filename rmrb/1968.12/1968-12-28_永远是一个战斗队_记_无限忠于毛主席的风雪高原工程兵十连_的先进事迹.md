Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved, and the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China issued an order, conferring the honorary title of "Infinite Loyalty to Chairman Mao's Wind and Snow Plateau Engineering Corps Tenth Company" on the Tenth Company of a certain engineering unit. This company is an exemplary model of adhering to and carrying forward the spirit of hard work and struggle during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Since the founding of the nation, the Tenth Company has taken Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" as its guide, enduring the wind and snow of the plateau for eighteen years, marching across the borders for three million li, and following Chairman Mao's footsteps every step of the way. The path they have taken is the path of hard struggle and continuous revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as guided by Chairman Mao.

During the war years, under the great commander Chairman Mao, the Tenth Company marched north and south, opening roads through mountains and building bridges over rivers, crossing the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, fighting bravely and invincibly.

After the nation's victory, some comrades thought: The great task is accomplished, and we can rest for a while. The Party branch of the Tenth Company guided the cadres and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's teachings at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee repeatedly: "Winning the nation's victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li. ... The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain the spirit of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant or impatient, and must continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, all the comrades in the company followed the path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, struggling hard and continuing the revolution. They said: The democratic revolution has been victorious, but we must advance towards socialism. If we do not continue to struggle hard, we cannot carry the revolution to the end, we cannot liberate all the oppressed and exploited class brothers, consolidate the new regime, and build a new China. The path indicated by Chairman Mao, we will follow it!

In 1950, the great commander Chairman Mao issued the order to build the Kangding-Tibet Highway and liberate a million serfs. The Tenth Company, without dismounting their horses or removing their armor, marched towards the Kangding Plateau with the smell of gunpowder still on them from the war years.

Building the Kangding-Tibet Highway is a great engineering feat rarely seen in the history of world road construction. The Kangding Plateau is covered with snow mountains and crisscrossed by raging rivers, with harsh weather conditions. Great difficulties could not stop the Tenth Company from following Chairman Mao in continuing the revolution. Many soldiers worked on the snow line of high mountains and suffered from severe snow blindness. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "To help the brother nationalities, do not fear difficulties, and strive to build roads," and despite the pain in their eyes, they remained at their posts.

In July 1953, the higher authorities ordered the Tenth Company to arrive at the upper reaches of the Angry River within five days to set up a steel cable suspension bridge, paving the way for tens of thousands of road builders, and ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions to complete the road to Lhasa by 1954. "Chairman Mao's instructions are the most urgent commands." The soldiers formed a long line, carrying steel cables weighing over a thousand pounds each, and with each person carrying an average of over a hundred pounds, they hacked through thorns, braved the wind and rain, and marched day and night. In just three and a half days, they crossed two mountains over four thousand meters high and covered a distance of 340 li, delivering the five steel cables to the riverbank.

At that time, it was the flood season, and the river water was rushing down at a speed of six to seven meters per second. The soldiers of the Tenth Company faced the roaring Angry River, each one eager to compete with the river's danger. Zhang Qin, Zhu Baoting, Liu Chaolin, Luo Chao, and other comrades who had won first-class merit for building the Kangding-Tibet Highway accepted the task of crossing the river first. They boarded a rubber boat, pulling a lead wire towards the opposite bank. The rubber boat spun like a leaf in the river. In the face of the constant danger of capsizing, the heroes remembered Chairman Mao's commands and encouraged each other with the heroic deeds of the Red Army crossing the Jinsha River and seizing the Luding Bridge. After nearly two hours of thrilling battle, they overcame wave after wave and whirlpool after whirlpool, successfully landing on the opposite bank. Immediately, they endured hunger and fatigue, continuing to fight, using the lead wire to pull the steel cable across the river. The lead wire was thin, and the steel cable was heavy. When their hands were cut by the lead wire, they wrapped the lead wire around their backs and crawled inch by inch. They said: To deliver Chairman Mao's warmth to the hearts of the Tibetan people as soon as possible, even if the lead wire cuts through flesh and bone, we will not retreat an inch. After three days and nights of battle, a 40-meter-high, 150-meter-long steel cable suspension bridge spanned the Angry River.

The soldiers of the Tenth Company followed Chairman Mao's footsteps, with a red heart, a steel shoulder, and iron hands, working together with brother units and road builders to open up the Kangding and Qinghai-Tibet highways. Then, they marched westwards, accepting even more arduous tasks. The soldiers proudly said: "In the cold, there is the red sun to warm us; in the high mountains, there are the four volumes of treasures to guide us. We will trample the dangers under our feet and split open the eternal ice and snow."

For eighteen years, the heroic Tenth Company has remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on hard struggle in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. They have taken root in the wind and snow plateau. They have lived in tents for a long time, and for twelve years, they have not slept on beds. The cadres and soldiers, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have battled the heat and endured the cold, splitting the snow-capped peaks, conquering the raging rivers, filling the marshes, and overcoming the rocky deserts. Wherever Chairman Mao points, they fight and wherever they fight, they win!

Last year, in response to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao to "support the broad masses of the left," the Tenth Company marched to a certain city to carry out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks. This was the first time the Tenth Company had entered a city since marching to Tibet.

In the face of new tests, the Party branch promptly organized the entire company to study Chairman Mao's great teachings: "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by armed enemies and are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." They studied the advanced deeds of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," who remained pure in the bustling city, and discussed the topic "Why we must maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle under new conditions." Through study and discussion, everyone deeply realized that consciously maintaining and carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle is a need for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and a need for the struggle between the two lines. The soldiers said: "If we relax in hard struggle, the bourgeoisie will attack; if we never forget hard struggle, the direction of the line struggle will be clear." The entire company loudly proposed: Learn from the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," fight the ideological battle to eliminate the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, and create new merits to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the class enemies regarded the Tenth Company, which advocated hard struggle and maintained close ties with the people, as a thorn in their eyes and a bone in their throat. Sometimes they used the despicable tactics of bourgeois flattery and praise to try to corrupt the revolutionary will of the cadres and soldiers, attempting to make the Tenth Company lose its way in the struggle between the two lines. Sometimes they used the vicious method of praising the Tenth Company and maliciously denigrating other companies, trying to split and disintegrate the left-supporting troops. The heroic Tenth Company resolutely withstood the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, smashed the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and like the eagle on the desert and the sturdy pine on the snow mountain, they did not sway in the wind or bow their heads under the frost and snow, bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They seriously implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, united closely with the broad revolutionary masses, and accurately and fiercely struck down a handful of class enemies, creating new merits for the people.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Without a firm and correct political direction, it is impossible to inspire the spirit of hard struggle." The heroic Tenth Company, in the journey of hard struggle and continuous revolution, has been invincible and unconquerable. The fundamental reason is that they insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, especially learning Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, arming their minds with the great Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Youth Idler Hao Zhenwu thought that joining the army would mean living in houses and having a comfortable life, but after joining, he was greeted by temperatures below thirty degrees and heavy, prolonged physical labor. A severe test was before him. The former company commander Wang Songhai and political instructor Wang Qingshan often guided him to study Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and the "Three Articles," and educated him on the struggle between the two lines. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Hao Zhenwu realized: A revolutionary soldier must execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and must break private desires and establish public interests. He criticized his wrong thoughts, determined to struggle for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on the wind and snow plateau for life. In the battle of White Bone Mountain, Hao Zhenwu served as the cook. He and his comrades dug through two meters of snow on the mountain top to set up camp. He ignored the severe high-altitude reaction, dug ice to build a stove, overcame numerous difficulties, and prepared meals for his comrades on time.

After being promoted to platoon leader, Comrade Zhu Mingcang's bed was made larger than that of the soldiers. He tossed and turned on the bed, feeling uncomfortable. He reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on the five conditions for a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, realizing that this was a small matter of life, but it reflected whether he, as a cadre, continued to maintain the style of an ordinary soldier or indulged in special treatment. If this continued, it would breed bureaucratism, stand above the masses, and deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He used this logic to persuade the soldiers and made his bed the same as the soldiers'. From then on, he used Mao Zedong Thought to guide his actions. In the cold winter, Zhu Mingcang, like when he was a soldier, swung a twelve-pound hammer to work. How much sweat the soldiers shed, he shed the same amount. He deeply felt: A cadre can only charge into battle and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line by always thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, never leaving the masses, and consciously fighting against selfishness and revisionism, carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle.

The red sun rises over the snow mountains, and a thousand beams of golden light warm the heart; the desert stretches for a thousand li, and every drop of clear water enters the heart. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the Tenth Company, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, is getting better and better. Since 1961, when the movement to create a four-good company began, they have been evaluated as a four-good company every year. Today, they are firmly remembering Chairman Mao's great teachings at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, continuing to maintain and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, forever following the great commander Chairman Mao, struggling hard and doing revolution.

For eighteen years, the soldiers of the Tenth Engineering Corps have battled from the plateau to the desert, from the snow mountains to the grasslands, splitting ice cliffs and fighting sandstorms, conquering treacherous mountains and rivers, overcoming countless difficulties, and completing construction tasks excellently. This is a soldier from the Tenth Company, with a fearless revolutionary spirit, braving the wind and snow, drilling holes on a steep slope.

    永远是一个战斗队
    ——记“无限忠于毛主席的风雪高原工程兵十连”的先进事迹
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准，由中共中央军委发布命令，授予“无限忠于毛主席的风雪高原工程兵十连”光荣称号的工程兵某部十连，是一个在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，贯彻执行毛主席革命路线、继续保持和发扬艰苦奋斗作风的好榜样。
    建国以来，十连以毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》为行动指南，风雪高原十八年，转战边疆三万里，步步紧跟毛主席。他们所走的路，就是毛主席指引的在无产阶级专政下艰苦奋斗继续革命的路。
    战争年代，在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，十连转战南北，逢山开路，遇水架桥，过黄河，跨长江，艰苦奋战，所向无敌。
    全国胜利以后，有的同志认为：大功告成了，可以歇歇脚了。十连党支部引导干部战士一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，全连同志沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的道路，艰苦奋斗，继续革命。他们说：民主革命胜利了，还要向社会主义前进，不继续艰苦奋斗，就不能将革命进行到底，就不能解放所有受压迫受剥削的阶级兄弟，巩固新政权，建设新中国。毛主席指引的路，我们走定了！
    一九五○年，伟大统帅毛主席发出了修筑康藏公路、解放百万农奴的命令，十连马不卸鞍，身不解甲，披着战争年代的一身硝烟，向康藏高原进军。
    修筑康藏公路，是世界公路建筑史上少有的伟大工程。康藏高原雪山遍布，激流纵横，气候恶劣。天大困难挡不住十连紧跟毛主席继续闹革命的步伐。许多战士在高山雪线上施工，得了严重的雪盲，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“为了帮助各兄弟民族，不怕困难，努力筑路”，眼睛痛得难受，仍然坚守战斗岗位。
    一九五三年七月，上级命令十连在五天内赶到怒江上游架设钢索吊桥，为数万筑路大军开路，保证落实毛主席的指示，在一九五四年把公路修到拉萨。“毛主席的指示就是最紧急的命令。”战士们排成一字长龙，抬着每根一千多斤的钢索，在每人平均负重上百斤的情况下，劈开荆棘，顶着风雨，日夜兼程，只用三天半时间，就翻越了两座拔海四千多米的大山，走完三百四十里路程，把五根钢索运到江边。
      当时正是洪水季节，江水以每秒六、七米的流速奔腾直下。十连战士面对咆哮的怒江，个个磨拳擦掌，誓与怒江天险比高低。修筑康藏公路荣立一等功的张琴和朱宝廷、刘朝林、罗朝等同志，接受了首先渡江的任务。他们乘坐一只橡皮舟，拉着铅丝向对岸强渡。橡皮舟象一片树叶在江心一个劲打转。在时刻都有翻船危险的情况下，勇士们念念不忘毛主席的命令，他们以红军抢渡金沙江、飞夺泸定桥的英雄事迹互相鼓舞。经过近两小时惊心动魄的激战，越过一个又一个巨浪，绕过一个又一个漩涡，胜利地登上了对岸。紧接着，他们又忍着饥饿、疲劳连续战斗，用铅丝牵引钢索过江。铅丝细，钢索重，手被铅丝拉破了，就把铅丝绕在脊梁上，一寸一寸地往前爬。他们说：为了早日把毛主席的温暖送到藏族同胞心里，就是铅丝勒得肉裂骨碎，也决不后退一寸。全连经过三昼夜奋战，一座四十米高、一百五十米长的钢索吊桥横跨在怒江天险上。
    十连战士们步步紧跟毛主席，以一颗红心，一副钢肩，一双铁手，同兄弟部队、筑路工人一道开辟了康藏、青藏公路，又挥戈西北，接受更艰巨的任务。战士们豪迈地说：“天寒有红太阳照暖，山高有四卷宝书引路，誓将艰险脚下踩，万年冰雪全劈开。”
    十八年来，英雄十连牢记毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告中关于艰苦奋斗的教导，扎根风雪高原。他们长期过着帐篷生活，整整十二年没有睡过铺板，干部战士靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，战酷热，抗严寒，劈开了奇峰峭壁的雪山，征服了奔腾咆哮的激流，填塞了举步难行的泥沼，战胜了乱石累累的戈壁滩。毛主席指向哪里，他们就战斗在哪里，就胜利在哪里！
    去年，十连响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，开赴某市执行“三支”“两军”任务。这是十连自向西藏进军以来第一次进驻城市。
    在新的考验面前，党支部及时组织全连学习毛主席的伟大教导：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”学习了“南京路上好八连”身居闹市，一尘不染的先进事迹，并以“在新的条件下，为什么更应保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的作风”为题展开大讨论。通过学习和讨论，使大家深刻认识到：自觉地保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，是无产阶级专政下继续革命的需要，是两条路线斗争的需要。指战员们说：“艰苦奋斗松一松，资产阶级就攻一攻；艰苦奋斗永不忘，路线斗争方向明。”全连响亮地提出：向“南京路上好八连”学习，打好灭资兴无的思想仗，为捍卫毛主席革命路线立新功。
    在无产阶级文化大革命两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，阶级敌人把发扬艰苦奋斗作风、密切联系人民群众的十连，看作眼中钉、肉中刺。他们有时用资产阶级的拉拢、捧场等卑鄙伎俩，妄图腐蚀干部战士的革命意志，使十连在两条路线斗争中迷失方向。有时他们又使出吹捧十连、恶意贬低其他连队的毒辣手段，妄想分化、瓦解支左部队。英雄的十连坚决顶住了资产阶级思想的侵袭，粉碎了糖衣炮弹的进攻，象戈壁滩上的雄鹰，象雪山上的劲松，狂风吹来身不摇，霜打雪压头不低，英勇地捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。他们认真地落实毛主席一系列最新指示，和广大革命群众紧紧团结在一起，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，为人民立了新功。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有坚定正确的政治方向，就不能激发艰苦奋斗的工作作风”。英雄十连在艰苦奋斗继续革命的征途中，战无不胜，攻无不克，最根本的原因，就是他们坚持在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，特别是学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装头脑，不断提高两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    知识青年郝振武，入伍前以为到部队一定是住楼房，过安适的生活，但入伍后迎接他的却是零下三十多度的严寒和繁重持久的体力劳动。严峻的考验摆在他面前。原任连长王松海、指导员王青山，经常辅导他学习毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和“老三篇”，对他进行两条路线斗争教育。在毛泽东思想哺育下，郝振武认识到：一个革命战士要执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线，必须破私立公。他批判了自己的错误思想，下定决心在风雪高原上为执行毛主席革命路线而奋斗终生。在大战白骨山的战斗中，郝振武当炊事班长，他和战友们在高山顶上扒开一两米深的积雪，安营扎寨。他不顾严重的高山反应，刨冰砌灶，克服重重困难，按时为战友们做好饭菜。
    班长朱明仓提升排长后，同志们把他的铺位搞得比战士的大。他睡在床上翻来复去觉得不是滋味，他重温毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人五个条件的教导，认识到这虽然是生活小事，但却反映了自己在当干部后是继续保持普通一兵的本色，还是闹特殊化的大问题。如果任其发展下去就会滋生官气，高高在上，脱离群众，就会背离毛主席的革命路线。他用这个道理说服了战士们，又把自己的铺位搞得和战士一样。从此，他处处用毛泽东思想统帅自己的行动。寒冬腊月朱明仓和当战士时一样，抡起十二磅大锤作业，战士流多少汗，他也流多少汗。他深深体会到：一个干部只有时时想着毛主席的教导，一刻也不脱离群众，自觉地斗私批修，发扬艰苦奋斗精神，才能为捍卫毛主席的革命路线冲锋陷阵，做一个永远忠于毛主席的坚强战士。
    雪山升起红太阳，万道金光暖心房；千里戈壁饮清泉，点点滴滴入心田。在毛泽东思想哺育下，十连这座毛泽东思想大学校越办越好，从一九六一年开展创造四好连队运动以来，年年被评为四好连队。今天，他们正牢记着毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的伟大教导，继续保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，永远紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，艰苦奋斗干革命。
