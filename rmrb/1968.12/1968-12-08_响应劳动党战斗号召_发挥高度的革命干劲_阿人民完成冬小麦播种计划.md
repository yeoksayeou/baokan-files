	Responding to the Labor Party's battle call, the Albanian people have displayed high revolutionary enthusiasm and completed the winter wheat sowing plan.

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 6th, the broad masses of agricultural laborers and workers of the machine-tractor stations in Albania have actively responded to the battle call issued by the Albanian Labor Party to increase grain production. They have displayed high revolutionary enthusiasm and labor ardor and have basically completed this year's winter wheat sowing task.

	According to materials released by the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture, by the end of November, sowing had been completed on 99 percent of the planned wheat area nationwide. Many agricultural cooperatives and state farms that have already completed their sowing tasks are continuing to expand the sowing area to strive for increased grain production next year.

	Since the autumn harvest, the broad masses of agricultural laborers in Albania have, while rushing to harvest corn and other autumn crops, been busy with plowing, loosening the soil, improving water conservancy, selecting superior seeds, and repairing farm tools to create good conditions for wheat sowing. The primary party organizations of the agricultural cooperatives and state farms across the country have, during the busy farming season, actively carried out political and ideological work. They have waged a struggle against various conservative views, bureaucratism, and pure technical views, thereby further boosting the revolutionary enthusiasm and labor ardor of the broad masses of cooperative members and state farm workers. This has made them more confident in the struggle to complete and overfulfill next year's grain production plan.

    响应劳动党战斗号召  发挥高度的革命干劲
    阿人民完成冬小麦播种计划
    据新华社地拉那六日电  阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者和机器拖拉机站职工，积极响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党提出的增加粮食生产的战斗号召，发挥高度的革命干劲和劳动热情，已经基本完成了今年的冬小麦播种任务。
    据阿尔巴尼亚农业部公布的材料，到十一月底，全国已在百分之九十九的小麦计划播种面积上，完成了播种工作。许多已经胜利完成播种任务的农业合作社和国营农场还在继续扩大播种面积，以争取明年增产更多的粮食。
    今年秋收以来，阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者在抢收玉米等秋季作物的同时，紧张地进行翻地松土、兴修水利、精选良种和整修农具等工作，为小麦的播种创造了良好的条件。各地农业合作社和国营农场的基层党组织，在农忙期间积极开展政治思想工作，进行反对各种保守观点、官僚主义和纯技术观点的斗争，因而进一步提高了广大农业合作社社员和国营农场职工的革命干劲和劳动热情，使他们在为完成和超额完成明年的粮食生产计划的斗争中，更加充满了信心。
