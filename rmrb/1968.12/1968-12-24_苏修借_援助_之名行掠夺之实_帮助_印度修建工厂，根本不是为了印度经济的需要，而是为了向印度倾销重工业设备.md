The Soviet revisionists, under the guise of "helping" India "develop its national economy," have built several large-scale heavy industrial factories in India. These factories are poorly managed, have low operating rates, and their products cannot be sold. This fully exposes the fact that the Soviet revisionists' "help" in building these factories for the Indian reactionary government is not for the actual needs of India's economy, but to dump heavy industrial equipment in India and exploit the blood and sweat of the Indian people.

To save the Soviet-aided factories from imminent bankruptcy, a delegation led by the chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, Skachkov, has been active in India for three weeks. This delegation held talks with some Indian reactionary government ministers on the 10th. The Soviet side demanded that the Indian government increase production at the Soviet-aided factories. The Indian side stated that the products of these factories cannot be sold in India, making increased production unprofitable. The Soviet delegation then demanded that the Indian government find overseas markets. When Indian officials pleaded with the Soviets to purchase some of the products, the Soviets immediately revealed their self-serving nature, stating that they could only offer prices lower than any other buyer.

The dark secrets of the Soviet-aided factories cannot be hidden by the Indian reactionary government. On the 13th, some members of the Indian Parliament loudly complained that the management of the Soviet-aided Lanchi Heavy Machinery Factory is very poor. This factory constantly demands more investment, but there are no returns.

    苏修借“援助”之名行掠夺之实
    “帮助”印度修建工厂，根本不是为了印度经济的需要，而是为了向印度倾销重工业设备
    据新华社二十日讯　新德里消息：在印度反动政府加紧出卖民族利益的情况下，苏修打着“帮助”印度“发展民族经济”的招牌，在印度修建了一些大型重工业工厂。这些厂都办得很糟，开工率很低，产品销不出去。这充分暴露出，苏修“帮助”印度反动派修建这些工厂，根本不是为了印度经济的实际需要，而是为了向印度倾销重工业设备，榨取印度人民的血汗。
    为了挽救苏“援”工厂日益破产的命运，由苏修对外经济联络委员会主席斯卡奇科夫率领的代表团，已经在印度活动了三个星期。这个代表团十日同印度反动政府的一些部长举行了会谈。苏修方面要印度政府增加苏“援”工厂的生产。印度方面表示，这些工厂的产品在印度销售不掉，增产是不合算的。苏修代表团则要印度政府设法寻找国外市场。当印度官员哀求苏修也购买一部分产品时，苏修方面马上暴露出损人利己的真面目，表示他们只能出比其他任何买主都低的价钱。
    苏“援”工厂的黑幕，印度反动政府瞒也瞒不住。十三日，印度议会中一些议员也吵吵闹闹地说，苏“援”兰奇重型机械厂的管理很差。这个工厂总是要求投入更多资金，但是没有任何收益。
