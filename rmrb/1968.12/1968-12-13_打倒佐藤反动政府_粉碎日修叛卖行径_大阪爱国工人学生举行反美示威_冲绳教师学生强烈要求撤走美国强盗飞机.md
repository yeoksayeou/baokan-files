About 2,000 patriotic workers and students in Osaka held an anti-American rally on December 10, vowing to fight to the end for the recovery of Okinawa and the overthrow of the Sato reactionary government.

A portion of the patriotic workers and students, holding high red banners with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," participated in the rally.

A worker spoke at the meeting, saying that the recent nationwide anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people has opened up a new situation for their victory. The Sato government, in the face of the people's struggle, has been frightened and is wielding the counter-revolutionary "Public Security Bill" to brutally suppress the Japanese people, and is forcing workers to accept low wages and do heavier work in an attempt to reverse its declining fortunes. He said, although we face these difficulties, we have already stood up in the struggle. We are determined to smash the betrayal of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda, who insists that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" can be abolished by a simple notice, and through our actual struggle, strive for final victory.

The meeting passed a resolution exposing the evil plan of the United States to again dispatch nuclear submarines to Sasebo Port, expressing the determination to use all efforts to fight against this military aggression by U.S. imperialism.

After the meeting, the participants marched through the busiest streets of Osaka, holding high their spirits. Workers and students, despite the threats and suppression of the reactionary police, shouted slogans such as "Smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,'" "Yankees go home," and "Overthrow the Sato government," and persisted in their demonstration march. Their just actions were warmly supported by the citizens.

According to a report from the New China News Agency, all 150 Japanese elementary and middle school teachers in the village of Kadena, where the U.S. military has its largest airbase in Okinawa, began a strike on December 7 to protest the long-term deployment of B-52 bombers by the U.S. military authorities in the Kadena base and their wanton aggression against Vietnam.

After announcing the strike, the teachers, together with the villagers, held a meeting and a protest demonstration.

After the meeting, the participants, with high spirits, held a demonstration march, shouting anti-American slogans.

According to a report from the New China News Agency, on December 2, patriotic students of Ryukyu University held a rally and demonstration march in Naha City, Okinawa, strongly demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. B-52 military aircraft stationed in Okinawa.

More than 300 students of Ryukyu University angrily held a rally in front of the building of the U.S. authorities in Naha City, determined to firmly stand up and fight for the withdrawal of the B-52 bombers and the removal of U.S. military bases from Okinawa.

The participants immediately proceeded with a demonstration march, advancing towards the U.S. military base in Kadena with high spirits, shouting slogans such as "Immediately withdraw the B-52 bombers" and "Smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.'" They joined another group of demonstrators in front of the base, jointly condemning the various evil deeds of the U.S. bandit aircraft. Then, the students rushed towards the scene inside the base where the aircraft had an accident.
