Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the Beijing Northern Suburbs Timber Factory has undergone a tremendous transformation. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become the primary need for all revolutionary workers in the factory. The revolutionary criticism has reached a new level, the work of purging class enemies has been carried out tightly and accurately, more than 82% of the office staff have been sent down to labor, and since July, production has continuously surged, transforming the factory from a "difficult unit" into an advanced unit.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 2nd, the Beijing Northern Suburbs Timber Factory Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," and with the enthusiastic help of the military supporting the left, has led the broad revolutionary workers to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. A magnificent and vigorous new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation has been launched. In just three months, the entire factory has undergone a tremendous transformation. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become the primary need for all revolutionary workers in the factory; revolutionary criticism, with production teams as the main battlefield, has reached a new level; the work of purging class enemies has been carried out tightly and accurately, with attention to policies, and deeply hidden class enemies have been uncovered; the entire factory has broken through old frameworks, streamlined organizations, and sent down more than 82% of the office staff; party-building work is being actively carried out; the movement for "four good" units and "five good" workers is gradually being launched in each workshop; since July, production has continuously surged, creating the highest monthly production level in history, and by November 14th, the annual production plan has been completed 47 days ahead of schedule; the spiritual face of all revolutionary workers in the factory has undergone a profound change, transforming from a "difficult unit" into an advanced unit.

With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," the factory has implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly changing its backward face.

The Beijing Northern Suburbs Timber Factory was established in 1956 through the merger of more than 200 private small factories. The factory has a complex personnel situation, and the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines has been intense and sharp. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the sabotage by the capitalist roaders and other class enemies within the factory, the two factions of revolutionary masses were severely opposed, and the "internal war" was unending. For a period, the factory was in a backward state of not struggling, not criticizing, and not transforming, becoming a "difficult unit." On July 11th of this year, after the military supporting the left entered the factory, they used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, mobilizing the masses with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance. Subsequently, on August 30th, the Revolutionary Committee was established. The newly born Revolutionary Committee has many tasks in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. How to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation quickly and well? The Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "learning to play the piano," arranged the tasks of each stage of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in a coordinated manner, achieving both a focus and attention to other aspects. When streamlining the organization, they firmly grasped this focus, concentrating superior forces, going to the masses and returning to the masses, repeatedly fermenting through "three ups and three downs," truly achieving the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucratism. At the same time, they combined the streamlining to reform some unreasonable regulations and institutions, and began political construction trial work in a workshop.

Handing over policies to the masses, accurately and firmly striking at class enemies

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be good at turning the party's policies into the actions of the masses, to be good at making every movement and struggle of ours, not only understood by the leading cadres but also understood and grasped by the broad masses, is a leadership art of Marxism-Leninism." The comrades of the Beijing Northern Suburbs Timber Factory deeply feel from their revolutionary practice that implementing Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction is the fundamental guarantee for relying on the masses to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The original Party Committee secretary of this factory was a relatively good cadre, but in the early stages of the movement, he implemented the capitalist reactionary line, and the masses were angry and wanted to overthrow him. Some comrades wanted to propose his release, but had reservations, suggesting that he be suspended for the time being. Everyone, with this problem in mind, carefully studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on correctly treating cadres, deeply feeling that this was not just a matter of releasing a certain person, but a matter of attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The idea of suspension was a manifestation of not believing in the masses, a reflection of the thought of seeking stability and fearing chaos. The core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to fully believe in the masses and rely on the masses. As long as the masses grasp the party's policies, they will definitely rise up to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At this time, the military supporting the left went deep into the masses and, together with the revolutionary workers, studied Chairman Mao's cadre policies and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on selecting cadres, and held discussions. An old worker said: "In the past, when looking at cadres, we didn't know what was a major issue and what was a minor issue, the ruler was not held correctly, and it was difficult to see clearly. This time, after studying, it became clear." They analyzed the entire history and work of this cadre, seeing that from the time he became a village cadre, he worked responsibly and led the way to join the army. After coming to the timber factory, he also did some good deeds, especially before the Cultural Revolution, he insisted on holding study classes on Chairman Mao's works; he insisted on Chairman Mao's cadre line of "appointing the talented," removing a number of landlord elements, capitalist elements, and counter-revolutionary elements who had infiltrated the cadre ranks, and promoting a batch of cadres from outstanding workers; he also actively supported the masses in technological innovation, developing production. After such an analysis, the workers said: "Such a cadre, if not released, is not defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." Everyone let him make a deep self-criticism at the meeting and happily elected him as the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee.

The personnel situation in this factory is complex. At the beginning of the work of purging class enemies, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses was high, and everyone demanded to expose this or that person. Facing this situation, the Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the military supporting the left, explained to the masses the plans, steps, policies, and boundaries of the struggle against the enemy, actively guiding the masses to investigate the enemy situation, expose doubts, and find clues, directing the struggle spearhead at a handful of class enemies. Through the method of combining the mobilization of the masses with in-depth investigation and research, the cover of class struggle was quickly lifted, a handful of class enemies were exposed, and two cases of current counter-revolutionary activities were cracked, exposing the counter-revolutionary elements involved, greatly pleasing the people! Now, the struggle against the enemy in this factory is further mobilizing the masses, leading, organizing, and planning to develop deeply.

Respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, daring to lead the masses to advance in big strides

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses harbor a great socialist enthusiasm." All revolutionary workers in the factory, under the help of the military supporting the left, actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, deeply study and apply "Old Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, through the tempering of the two-line struggle in the factory, greatly improved their political awareness, and released immense revolutionary enthusiasm and boundless creativity. They put forward various requirements and suggestions to the Revolutionary Committee, which can be summarized as one point: to quickly change the backward face, shake off the "difficult unit" hat, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

When this factory held a training class for streamlining cadres, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions on cadres going down to labor. Before the Revolutionary Committee could mobilize, the entire factory was already boiling. The workers said: "Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like timely rain, guiding lights, and are invincible spiritual atomic bombs." They beat drums and gongs to the offices, welcoming cadres to the workshops. The office cadres stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, declaring: "Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow the path you point out, seize the good opportunity to learn anew, and become an ordinary laborer." In this situation, should we respect the masses' pioneering spirit and lead the masses to advance in big strides, or should we follow the masses step by step? The Revolutionary Committee believed that to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the only correct path is to fully exert the leading role of the working class, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, dare to launch mass movements, and lead the masses to revolution and innovation. Originally, the factory Revolutionary Committee planned to arrange the time for streamlining the organization to be a bit later, but under the promotion of the revolutionary workers, the plan was immediately revised. The entire factory acted swiftly, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi promoted in the construction of political power, and in one breath, broke through old frameworks, abolished one office, two rooms, and seven departments, established political and production groups, changing from the original three-level leadership to two-level leadership. The members of the Revolutionary Committee also took the lead in going down to the teams to participate in labor. In a short time, the work of streamlining the organization and sending down office staff was completed. They deeply felt: "Only by respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, humbly learning from the masses, and constantly overcoming the rightist conservative thoughts in one's mind, can one continuously revolutionize and advance in big strides."

    紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署　掀起群众性斗、批、改高潮
    北京北郊木材厂发生翻天覆地变化
    活学活用毛主席著作成为全厂革命职工的第一需要，革命大批判发展到新水平，清理阶级队伍的工作抓得紧抓得准，百分之八十二以上的科室人员下放劳动，七月份以来生产连续跃进，由“老大难”单位变成先进单位
    据新华社二日讯　北京市北郊木材厂革命委员会，在伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的最新指示指引下，在支左解放军的热情帮助下，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，带领广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起了轰轰烈烈的，群众性的斗、批、改新高潮。短短三个月时间，全厂发生了翻天覆地的变化。活学活用毛主席著作已成为全厂革命职工生活的第一需要；以班组为主要阵地的革命大批判已发展到新水平；清理阶级队伍抓得紧，抓得准，注意掌握政策，挖出了埋藏较深的阶级敌人；全厂打破旧框框，精简了机构，下放了百分之八十二以上的科室人员；整党建党工作正在积极进行；四好单位五好职工运动已在各车间逐步展开；今年七月份以来，生产连续跃进，创造了历史上最高的月产水平，到十一月十四日，已提前四十七天胜利完成了全年生产计划；全厂革命职工的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，由“老大难”单位变成了先进的单位。
    以“只争朝夕”的革命精神落实毛主席
  的最新指示，迅速改变落后面貌
    北郊木材厂是一九五六年公私合营时，由二百多家私营小厂经过多次合并发展起来的。厂里人员复杂，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直十分激烈尖锐。无产阶级文化大革命中，由于厂内走资派和其他阶级敌人的破坏，造成两派群众组织严重对立，“内战”不休，在一段时间内处于一不斗，二不批，三不改的落后状态，成为一个“老大难”单位。今年七月十一日，支左解放军进厂后，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，发动群众以“只争朝夕”的革命精神落实毛主席的最新指示，迅速巩固和发展了革命大联合。接着，在八月三十日成立了革命委员会。新生的革命委员会成立后，斗、批、改的任务很多，如何以“只争朝夕”的革命精神落实毛主席的最新指示，把斗、批、改搞得既快又好？革委会遵照毛主席关于“学会‘弹钢琴’。弹钢琴要十个指头都动作，不能有的动，有的不动。但是，十个指头同时都按下去，那也不成调子。要产生好的音乐，十个指头的动作要有节奏，要互相配合。党委要抓紧中心工作，又要围绕中心工作而同时开展其他方面的工作。……不能只注意一部分问题而把别的丢掉。凡是有问题的地方都要点一下，这个方法我们一定要学会”的教导，根据本厂的实际情况，把斗、批、改各个阶段的任务统筹安排，做到既有中心，又兼顾其他。精简机构的时候，他们狠狠抓住这个中心，集中优势兵力，从群众中来，到群众中去，经过“三上三下”反复酝酿，真正达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的。在这同时，他们既结合精简改革了一些不合理的规章制度，又在一个车间开始了政治建厂试点工作。
  把政策交给群众，稳准狠地打击阶级敌人
    毛主席教导我们：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。”北郊木材厂的同志们从自己的革命实践中深深感到：贯彻毛主席的这一英明指示，是依靠群众，搞好斗、批、改的根本保证。
    这个厂的原党委书记，是个较好的干部，但在运动初期，执行了资产阶级反动路线，群众有气，要打倒他。有的同志想提出解放他，但有顾虑，建议暂时挂起来。大家带着这个问题，认真学习了毛主席关于正确地对待干部的伟大教导，深深感到：这不仅是解放某一个人的问题，而是对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的态度问题。挂起来的想法，就是不相信群众的表现，是求稳怕乱的思想反映。毛主席无产阶级革命路线的核心，就是充分相信群众，依靠群众。只要群众掌握了党的政策，就一定会自觉地起来捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这时候，支左解放军深入群众，和革命职工共同学习毛主席的干部政策和林副主席关于选拔干部的指示，进行了座谈讨论。有的老工人说：“过去看干部，不知道什么是大节，什么是小节，尺子没拿对，看也看不准，这回一学就明白了。”他们分析了这个干部的全部历史和全部工作，看到他从当村干部起，工作负责，并带头参军。来到木材厂后，也做了些好事，突出的是，文化大革命前，坚持开办毛主席著作学习班；坚持毛主席“任人唯贤”的干部路线，把一些混进干部队伍中的地主分子、资产阶级分子和反革命分子清除出去，又从优秀工人中提拔了一批干部；他还积极支持群众搞技术革新，发展了生产。经过这样一摆，工人们说：“象这样的干部，如果不解放，就是没有捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”大家让他在大会上做了深刻检查，高高兴兴地选他当了革委会副主任。
    这个厂人员情况复杂。清理阶级队伍工作一开始，广大群众革命积极性很高，纷纷要求揪这个揪那个。面对这种情况，革委会在支左解放军帮助下，向群众交代了对敌斗争的计划步骤、方针政策和揪与不揪的界限，积极引导群众大查敌情、大摆疑点、大找线索，把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人。通过发动群众和专案调查研究工作相结合的方法，迅速揭开了阶级斗争盖子，揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，并破获了两起现行反革命案件，揪出了作案的反革命分子，大快人心！现在这个厂的对敌斗争正在进一步发动群众，有领导、有组织、有计划地深入发展。
  尊重群众首创精神，敢于带领群众大步前进
    毛主席教导我们：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”全厂广大革命职工，在支左解放军帮助下，活学活用毛泽东思想，大学大用“老三篇”和毛主席一系列最新指示，通过厂里两条路线斗争的锻炼，大大提高了政治觉悟，迸发出巨大的革命积极性和无穷的创造力，他们向革委会提出了各种各样的要求和建议，这些意见归结起来就是一点：要迅速改变落后面貌，甩掉“老大难”帽子，紧紧跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    这个厂在举办精简机构干部学习班时，伟大领袖毛主席发表了关于干部下放劳动的最新指示。未等革委会动员，全厂已沸腾起来了。工人们说：“毛主席的最新指示是及时雨，指路灯，是威力无比的精神原子弹。”他们敲锣打鼓到科室，欢迎干部下车间。科室干部们非常激动地站在毛主席像前表决心：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定走您指引的路，抓住重新学习的好机会，当一个普通劳动者。”在这种情况下，是尊重群众的首创精神，带领群众大踏步前进呢？还是跟在群众后面一步步慢慢来？革委会认为要认真搞好斗、批、改，唯一正确的途径就是充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，尊重群众的首创精神，敢于大搞群众运动，带领群众去革命、去创新。本来，厂革委会安排精简机构工作的时间，还要靠后一点，但在革命职工的促进下，立刻修改了计划，全厂雷厉风行，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，并一鼓作气，打破旧框框，撤消了一处二室七大科，建立了政工、生产两个组，由原来的三级领导改为两级领导。革委会委员也带头下放到班组参加劳动。很短时间内，就完成了精简机构和下放科室人员的工作。他们深有体会地说：“只有尊重群众的首创精神，虚心向群众学习，不断克服自己头脑里的右倾保守思想，才能不断革命，大踏步前进。”
