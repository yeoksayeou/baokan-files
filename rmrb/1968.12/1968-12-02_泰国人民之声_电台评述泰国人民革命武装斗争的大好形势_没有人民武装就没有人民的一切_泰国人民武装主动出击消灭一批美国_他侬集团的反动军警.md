The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast an article on November 30, commenting on the favorable situation of the Thai people's armed revolutionary struggle. It called on the Thai people to unite more closely around the Thai Communist Party and carry the armed revolutionary struggle through to the end.

The article pointed out that three years ago, the spark of people's armed struggle that ignited in the village of Pupan Mountain in the county of Nakhon Phanom has now become a raging fire of people's war, rapidly spreading to the vast areas of 31 provinces across the country.

The article pointed out that the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's armed forces is due to the Thai Communist Party's integration of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice of Thailand, taking the path of armed struggle, mobilizing the peasant masses, establishing rural bases, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and ultimately seizing national power. The Thai Communist Party has summarized the experiences and lessons of the Thai people's revolutionary struggle, following the teachings of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, who said, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." It bravely leads the Thai people to take up arms, engage in armed struggle, and expel the American imperialists and their lackey, the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique.

The article said that under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's armed forces have learned and mastered Chairman Mao Zedong's theories on people's war, and have flexibly applied them, repeatedly smashing the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," and more actively attacking the enemy, moving from one victory to another. In the battle, the people's armed forces have a fearless and dauntless spirit, fearing neither hardships nor death. This is because they are fighting not for the narrow interests of a few individuals or a small group, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people and for the interests of the entire nation.

The article said that the development of armed struggle under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party has brought about a great change in the revolutionary situation in Thailand, which is extremely favorable to the people. The vast peasant masses in the countryside have risen up to take control of their own destiny. They deeply feel that without armed struggle, there will certainly be no position for the people; without the people's armed forces, there will be nothing for the people. Therefore, they firmly grasp the guns in their hands and resolutely advance along the path of armed struggle led by the Thai Communist Party. People from all walks of life who are oppressed and exploited by the American-Thanom clique also clearly realize that the path of armed struggle is the only way to drive out the American imperialists, gain national independence, and enjoy democracy. Therefore, more and more people support and participate in the people's armed struggle.

The article said that the rapidly developing people's armed struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the American-Thanom clique. The enemy is desperately struggling, trying every means to stop the development of the people's armed struggle. Seeing that mere military suppression is ineffective, they have turned to political trickery, issuing a false constitution and holding fake elections, attempting to deceive the people into abandoning armed struggle. However, no matter what tricks the American-Thanom clique plays, they cannot save themselves from their inevitable doom. Since the beginning of this year, when the American-Thanom clique played political tricks, the people's armed struggle has become even more vigorous. This greatly encouraged the Thai people and proved that the armed struggle line led by the Thai Communist Party is completely correct.

The article finally pointed out that in the rapidly developing revolutionary situation in Thailand and the international revolutionary situation today, as long as the Thai people unite more closely around the Thai Communist Party, expand the patriotic democratic forces more broadly, persist in armed struggle, and launch more powerful attacks against the American imperialists and the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, victory will surely belong to the Thai people, and the American-Thanom clique will be annihilated.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on November 28, the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station reported on November 27 that the armed forces of the northern Thai people, led by the Thai Communist Party, have recently taken the initiative to launch attacks and achieved continuous victories, eliminating a batch of reactionary military and police from the American-Thanom clique.

The radio station said that according to incomplete statistics, the armed forces in Chiang Rai Province fought with enemy military and police 20 times from early September to November 24, killing and wounding more than 30 enemy personnel, and executing several enemy spies. The armed forces in Nakhon Sawan Province shot down two helicopters of the American-Thanom reactionary clique in early September and early October, eliminating all the enemy personnel on board, approximately 20 people. The radio station said that the recently developed armed forces in Phetchabun Province used flexible and mobile tactics to concentrate superior forces and bravely launch a night attack on the enemy stronghold on November 21, burning down the enemy barracks and annihilating 12 reactionary military and police. Before this, the armed forces in Phetchabun Province had also cooperated with local masses to execute two extremely evil reactionary elements, receiving warm welcome and support from the masses.

The radio station pointed out that the continuous victories of the northern armed forces have greatly encouraged the Thai people, making them more clearly recognize that the path of armed struggle pointed out by the Thai Communist Party is the only way for Thailand to achieve true independence and democracy.

    “泰国人民之声”电台评述泰国人民革命武装斗争的大好形势
    没有人民武装就没有人民的一切
    泰国人民武装主动出击消灭一批美国—他侬集团的反动军警
    新华社一日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台三十日广播一篇文章，评述泰国人民革命武装斗争的大好形势，号召泰国人民更紧密地团结在泰国共产党的周围，把革命武装斗争进行到底。
    文章指出，三年前在普潘山那家县燃起的人民武装斗争的星星之火，已成为人民战争的熊熊烈火，迅速地蔓延到全国三十一个府的广大地区。
    文章指出，泰国人民武装如此迅速发展壮大，是由于泰国共产党把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同泰国的革命实践相结合，走武装斗争的道路，实行动员农民群众，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权的革命路线。泰国共产党总结了泰国人民革命斗争的经验教训，按照世界革命人民的伟大导师毛泽东主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，坚决勇敢地领导泰国人民拿起武器，进行武装斗争，驱逐美帝侵略者及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团。
    文章说，在泰国共产党领导下，泰国人民武装学习和掌握毛泽东主席关于人民战争的理论，并灵活地加以运用，一次又一次地粉碎敌人“围剿”，更多地主动进攻敌人，从胜利不断走向胜利。在战斗中，人民武装具有翻天覆地的大无畏精神，不怕困难不怕死。这是因为他们不是为着少数人或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益而战斗的。
    文章说，泰国共产党领导下的武装斗争的发展，使泰国革命形势发生了非常有利于人民的巨大变化。农村广大农民群众已经起来掌握自己的命运。他们深刻体会到：如果不进行武装斗争，就决没有人民的地位；没有人民武装，就没有人民的一切。因此，他们紧握手中枪，坚决沿着泰国共产党领导的武装斗争道路前进。处在美国—他侬集团压迫剥削下的各界人民，也清楚地认识到武装斗争道路，是能够驱逐美帝侵略者，使国家获得独立，人民享有民主的唯一道路。因此，越来越多的人支持和参加人民武装斗争。
    文章说，迅速发展的人民武装斗争，沉重地打击了美国—他侬集团的反动统治。敌人正想方设法疯狂挣扎，妄图阻止人民武装斗争的发展。它们看到单用武力镇压已经无效，就转而玩弄政治骗局，颁布伪宪法，举行伪选举，妄图诱骗人民放弃武装斗争。但是，不管美国—他侬集团玩弄什么阴谋诡计，都决不能挽救他们必然灭亡的命运。自从今年初美国—他侬集团玩弄政治骗局以来，人民武装斗争更加蓬勃发展。这大大鼓舞了泰国人民，证明了泰国共产党领导的武装斗争路线是完全正确的。
    文章最后指出，在泰国革命形势和国际革命形势迅速发展的今天，只要泰国人民更紧密地团结在泰共的周围，更广泛地扩大爱国民主力量，坚持不懈地进行武装斗争，更猛烈地进攻美帝侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国集团，胜利就一定属于泰国人民，美国—他侬集团将被消灭。
    据新华社二十八日讯据“泰国人民之声”电台二十七日广播，泰国共产党领导下的泰国北部人民武装，最近以来，主动出击，不断取得胜利，消灭了一批美国—他侬集团的反动军警。
    电台说，据不完全统计，清莱府人民武装在九月初到十一月二十四日期间，同敌人军警战斗二十次，打死打伤敌人三十多名，处决敌人暗探多人。难府人民武装在九月初和十月初，打落美国—他侬反动集团的直升飞机两架，消灭了机上全部敌人约二十人。电台说，最近发展起来的彭世洛府人民武装，运用机动灵活的战术，在十一月二十一日集中优势兵力，英勇地夜袭敌人据点，烧毁敌人营房，歼灭了反动军警十二人。在此以前，彭世洛府人民武装，还曾协同当地群众处决了两名罪大恶极的反动分子，受到群众的热烈欢迎和支持。
    电台指出，北部人民武装不断取得新胜利，大大鼓舞了泰国人民，使他们更清楚地认识到：泰国共产党指出的武装斗争道路，是泰国获得真正独立、民主的唯一出路。
