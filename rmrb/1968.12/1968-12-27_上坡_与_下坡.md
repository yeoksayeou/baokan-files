In the deep mountains and valleys of Shandong's Wulian County, there is a small village of thirteen households called Liguo Village. After being baptized by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the small village underwent a tremendous transformation. Among all the changes, the most significant is the change in people. The brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong have illuminated every corner of the village, shining into the depths of every person's soul. Visitors to this small village have given it a new name: "Publicity Gully." Indeed, here, everyone voluntarily engages in self-criticism and struggles against selfishness and revisionism, making public-spiritedness a common practice. Below are two small stories that occurred in "Publicity Gully":

"Uphill" and "Downhill"

At a Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the production brigade, an elderly community member in his fifties was reporting on his recent activities, both those loyal to Chairman Mao and those that were not yet fully loyal. This community member was Duan Youfu.

Duan Youfu used to be quite selfish. Community members described him as "a lazy man at work, a good man after work." Brigade leader Liu Taiqin gave him the "Three Articles" to study, instructing him to first master the phrase "selflessly serving the people." Youfu complied. When the brigade's youth did good deeds for the collective, people often noticed an extra person in the crowd—this was Duan Youfu.

However, the demon of "selfishness" is stubborn. When "public-spiritedness" suppresses it, it sometimes resurfaces. Once, the youth worked late into the night repairing a road, and Youfu participated. He eagerly awaited the arrival of a cadre to praise him. Fortunately, Liu Taiqin came and indeed praised him. He felt delighted.

One day, the brigade was working on "Dazhai Fields," and Youfu got up early to work on the mountain, tilling a large area by dawn. He saw a distant figure approaching, thinking it was a cadre, but it turned out to be Fang Baorong. Without a word, she joined in tilling. Youfu was annoyed: "I tilled this large area, and you came to take over. Others won't know if it was you or me who tilled it. You make me work in the shadows!" Unfortunately, this time the cadre did not praise him.

After this incident, Youfu became like a deflated balloon, going to work late. Everyone criticized him for not having completely uprooted his "selfishness"; it was cut down on one side but sprouted on the other.

Youfu wanted praise but received criticism instead, feeling very uncomfortable. The family study class helped him. Everyone in the family spoke up: "You did good deeds for the public to seek praise, which is still selfish. Chairman Mao teaches us to have 'no selfishness and no personal gain,' but what have you done? Chairman Mao criticized those who think they are great after doing a little work and fear that others won't know, aren't you just like that!" Chairman Mao's teachings hit Youfu's weak spot. From then on, he deeply realized that "self-criticism" must be fought every day, every moment, until old age. From then on, whenever the "selfish" thought appeared in his mind, he would "grasp" it and fight it.

He did good deeds for the public based on his limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao. He said, "No matter how public-spirited you are, being limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao is the greatest public-spiritedness." His family was responsible for raising a pig for the brigade. He did not accept the feed given by the brigade but fed the pig with all twenty-plus pounds of peanut cakes from his own home. Later, when they pressed oil, they got another six pounds of peanut cakes. His wife wanted to sell them to buy oil. Youfu said, "Without Chairman Mao's leadership, there would be no us. We must be wholeheartedly devoted to the collective; the cakes are for feeding the pig, not for selling!"

The deeds of active learner of Mao Zedong Thought, Duan Youfu, for the public are countless and cannot be fully listed. When asked to share his learning experiences, he said: "I often study Chairman Mao's works, and I feel this change: in the past, doing good deeds for the public was like going uphill, very strenuous; now, it is like going downhill, very smooth!"

The difference between "uphill" and "downhill" reflects the spiritual transformation of this old poor peasant.

### “上坡”与“下坡”

    “公字沟”新风
    在山东五莲县的深山峡谷之中，有一个十三户人家的小山村，名叫李崮寨。经过无产阶级文化大革命的洗礼，小山村发生了天翻地覆的变化。千变万变，最大的变化是人在变，光辉的毛泽东思想照射到山村的各个角落，照亮了每个人的灵魂深处。来这里参观的人给这个小山村又起了个名，叫做“公字沟”。确实，这里人人自觉斗私批修，为公成风。下边记述的是发生在“公字沟”的两个小故事：
    “上坡”与“下坡”
    在生产队办的毛泽东思想学习班汇报会上，一位年过半百的老社员，正在汇报近几天干的事，那些忠于毛主席，那些还不够忠。这个社员就是段有富。
    段有富原来私心比较重。社员们形容他“出工是懒汉，下工是好汉。”生产队干部刘太臻拿了“老三篇”给他，让他先把“毫不利己专门利人”这句学好。有富照办了。当队里的青年为集体干好事时，人们经常发现队伍里多了一个人——这就是段有富。
    可是“私”字这个怪物是顽固的，“公”字把它压下去，有时它又翻上来。一次青年们晚上修路，有富参加了。他老盼着碰上个干部，好表扬表扬。正巧刘太臻来了，真的表扬了他。他心里美滋滋的。
    有一天队里搞“大寨田”，有富起了个大早上了山，干到天明刨了一大片。他看到远处来了个黑影，以为是干部，谁知是房保荣。她二话没说，搭上就刨。有富打心里烦气：我刨了这一大片，你来接上就刨，别人来看，也分不清是你刨的还是我刨的，你叫俺出力出在黑影里？可巧这次干部也没表扬他。
    这件事后，有富象皮球漏了气，干活去的也晚了。大家批评他“私”字没有连根拔，这边铲了去，那边又冒芽。
    有富想受表扬，反而受了批评，别扭得要命。家庭学习班就帮助他。全家人七言八语：你为公做好事是想受表扬，这还是为私。毛主席教导我们要“毫无自私自利之心”，可你怎么做的；毛主席批评有种人出了一点力就觉得了不起，生怕人家不知道，你不就是这种人！毛主席的教导，打中了有富的要害。从此以后，他深深认识到，“斗私”一定要时时斗，天天斗，活到老斗到老。打这起，只要头脑里“私”字一露头，他就“揪”出来斗。
    他为公是建立在对毛主席的无限忠上。他说：“千公万公，无限忠于毛主席才是最大的公。”他家分工给队里喂着一头猪。队里分给的饲料他不收，把自己家里的二十多斤花生饼，全部喂了这头猪。以后打油又打出了六斤花生饼，老伴想卖了买火油。有富说：“不是毛主席领导，就没有咱们一家。咱得一心为集体，饼是喂猪的，不能卖！”
    活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子段有富为公的事迹数不尽摆不完。让他谈学习体会时，他说：经常学习毛主席著作，我觉得有这点变化：过去为公象上坡，很费劲；现在为公象下坡，很顺畅！
      “上坡”与“下坡”一字之差，反映了这个老贫农精神境界的变化。
