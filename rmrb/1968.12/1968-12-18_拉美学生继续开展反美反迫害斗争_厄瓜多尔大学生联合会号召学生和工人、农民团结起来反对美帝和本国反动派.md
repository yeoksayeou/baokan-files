Latin American students continue their struggles against U.S. aggression, against the corrupt educational system, and against repression by reactionary governments. Following large-scale demonstrations on December 12th and 13th in Mexico City, Mexican students bravely persisted in their fight despite brutal police repression. On the 14th, the reactionary government openly dispatched troops to surround the university and threatened to open fire on the demonstrating students. However, the students were not intimidated. They held protest rallies and, in response, proposed organizing combat teams to counter police brutality.

In Nicaragua, a group of students staged a hunger strike on the 12th in front of the parliament building in Managua. The protesting students vowed to pressure the parliament to increase funding for the National Autonomous University.

Meanwhile, Ecuadorian students have risen up against government repression of the student movement. Faced with the brave struggle of the students, the butcher responsible for the bloody repression of students, Interior and Police Minister Blasco Peña Herrera, was forced to resign. The Ecuadorian University Student Federation recently issued a statement calling on all students, workers, and peasants to "unite into a mighty fighting force" against U.S. imperialism, feudal landlords, and reactionaries.

    本报讯　拉丁美洲各国学生反对美帝侵略、反对腐朽教育制度、反对反动政府迫害的斗争继续高涨。墨西哥大学生继十二日、十三日在墨西哥城连续举行大规模示威之后，面对警察残酷镇压，仍然英勇坚持斗争。十四日，反动政府公然派军队包围大学，并威胁要开枪对付示威学生。但是学生们并没有被吓倒，他们举行示威集会，并针锋相对，提出以组织战斗小组来对付警察暴行。
    在尼加拉瓜，一批学生十二日在马那瓜的议会门前举行绝食斗争。示威学生表示他们决心要对议会施加压力，要求增加对国立自治大学的经费。
    同时，厄瓜多尔大学生也奋起反对政府镇压学生运动暴行。在英勇的学生斗争面前，血腥镇压学生的刽子手、内政和警察部长布拉斯科·佩纳埃雷拉已被迫辞职。厄瓜多尔大学生联合会最近又发表声明，号召全体学生、工人和农民“团结成一支巨大的战斗队伍”反对美帝国主义、封建地主和反动派。
