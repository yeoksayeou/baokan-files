Wuhan Steel Corporation's broad masses of industrial workers, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, have deeply launched a study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, which has powerfully promoted the revolution and production.

After the publication of the latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao, "The experience of history is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be frequently spoken of and repeatedly spoken of. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," it greatly inspired the workers of Wuhan Steel. With the help of the support-leftist troops of the People's Liberation Army, each factory, mine, workshop, and office immediately set up thousands of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launching a wave of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. In the study, they carried forward the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao of combining theory with practice, combining the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party with the actual struggle between the two lines at Wuhan Steel, and combining it with the current struggle, criticism, and transformation at Wuhan Steel. Using the great leader Chairman Mao's directive on the construction of Wuhan Steel and Chairman Mao's endorsement of the "Anshan Constitution" as sharp weapons, they launched a magnificent revolutionary criticism of the extensive and deeply harmful counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "expert management of the factory" spread by the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi and his agents at Wuhan Steel.

The study of the history of the struggle between the two lines has promoted the ideological revolutionization of people and driven the production of each unit. The broad masses of workers, with the heroic spirit that "the working class must lead everything," have created countless miracles in the revolution and production. The No. 1 blast furnace in the iron smelting plant, which our great leader Chairman Mao inspected during his visit to Wuhan Steel ten years ago, personally witnessed it flowing out the first batch of iron water. Recently, the workers, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, proposed to make the blast furnace highly productive. A bourgeois technical "authority" maliciously said: The furnace age exceeds ten years, and the daily output cannot exceed the specified number of tons. The iron smelting workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought do not believe this nonsense. Relying on the wisdom of the workers themselves, they strengthened the maintenance and upkeep of the furnace body, daringly reformed the operating technology, and finally made the average daily output of the blast furnace greatly exceed the limit set by the bourgeois technical "authority," creating the highest level so far this year.

    武钢开展两条路线斗争史学习
    有力地推动了革命和生产发展
    据新华社武汉电　武汉钢铁公司广大产业工人，在解放军支左部队的帮助下，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习，有力地推动了革命和生产。
    伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表后，极大地鼓舞了武钢广大工人。在解放军支左部队帮助下，各厂、矿、车间和科室立即办起了数以千计各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了学习党内两条路线斗争史的热潮。学习中，他们发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，把党内两条路线斗争史的学习，同武钢的两条路线斗争实际结合起来，同武钢当前的斗、批、改结合起来，以伟大领袖毛主席对武钢建设的指示和毛主席批示的“鞍钢宪法”为锐利武器，对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其在武钢的代理人散布最广、流毒甚深的“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货，展开了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。
    两条路线斗争史的学习，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了各单位的生产。广大工人以“工人阶级必须领导一切”的英雄气概，在革命和生产方面创造出许许多多奇迹。炼铁厂的一号高炉，十年前我们伟大领袖毛主席视察武钢时，曾亲临观看它流出了第一炉铁水。前些时，工人们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心，提出要使高炉高产。有个资产阶级技术“权威”却风言风语地说：炉龄超过十年，日产不能超过规定的吨数。用毛泽东思想武装起来的炼铁工人不信这个邪，依靠工人自己的智慧，加强了炉体的维修保养，大胆地改革操作技术，终于使高炉的平均日产量大大超过资产阶级技术“权威”所规定的限度，创造了今年以来的最高水平。
