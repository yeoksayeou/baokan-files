In the current fervor of the masses of soldiers and civilians deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines and fully implementing the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a piece of heart-stirring news has been received: our country has successfully conducted a new hydrogen bomb test! All the revolutionary workers of our factory, with hearts full of excitement, joyfully celebrate the new leap in the development of our country's nuclear weapons, and joyfully celebrate another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone repeatedly raises their arms and shouts: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Comrade Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "We must, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants, so as to change the spiritual face of the laboring people, and transform spiritual power into tremendous material power." The success of this new hydrogen bomb test is the result of the workers, the People's Liberation Army, and the scientific and technical personnel engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons in our country, who have high-held the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform." They are full of vigor and high morale, seize the revolution, and vigorously promote production.

With Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything. The success of the new hydrogen bomb test relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and all our work achievements also rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past year, our factory, with the help of the support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit, has achieved certain results in the struggle, criticism, and reform. This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In August of this year, we, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "the working class must lead everything," boldly stepped onto the political stage of the struggle, criticism, and reform of the superstructure. All the workers of the factory, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the fundamental direction, and thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. "In the struggle, constantly raise one's political consciousness," greatly promoting the thought revolution of the people.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world and crawl step by step behind others. We must break the conventions and adopt advanced technology as much as possible, and in a not too long historical period, build our country into a modernized socialist power." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we thoroughly criticized the slave mentality and crawlingism advocated by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and the "black four generals" (production first, business in command; experts in charge of the factory, technology in command; material incentives, bonuses in command; money first, profits in command) promoted by his agents in our factory. This greatly raised the awareness of the two-line struggle among the revolutionary workers and created the highest production level since the founding of the factory. After completing the annual production plan two months and seventeen days ahead of schedule, the production tasks for the last two months were also continuously overfulfilled.

In the year that is about to pass, although our factory's revolution and production have achieved certain results, there is still a long way to go to meet Chairman Mao's requirements for us. We are determined to ride the mighty east wind of the success of the new hydrogen bomb test, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the core and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to further fully implement the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and to welcome the victorious convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party with outstanding achievements in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

    热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    北京针织总厂革委会
    在当前亿万军民深入学习两条路线斗争史、全面落实党的八届十二中全会公报所提出的各项战斗任务的热潮中，传来了一个振奋人心的特大喜讯：我国成功地进行了一次新的氢弹试验！我们厂全体革命职工怀着无比激动的心情热烈欢呼我国核武器发展的新飞跃，热烈欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。大家千万遍地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    林副主席指示我们说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”这次新的氢弹试验的成功，是我国从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军和科学技术人员高举马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决响应毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大号召，意气风发，斗志昂扬，狠抓革命，猛促生产的结果。
    有了毛泽东思想就有了一切。新的氢弹的试验成功靠的是毛泽东思想，我们一切工作取得成果靠的也是毛泽东思想。一年来，我厂在八三四一部队驻厂支左人员的帮助下，在斗、批、改中取得了一定的成绩，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。今年八月，我们遵照毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示，豪迈地登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台以后，全厂职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓根本不转向，大批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，“在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”，大大地促进了人的思想革命化。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。”根据毛主席的教导，我们狠批了大工贼刘少奇所鼓吹的洋奴哲学、爬行主义及其在本厂代理人所推行的“黑四帅”（生产第一，业务挂帅；专家治厂，技术挂帅；物质刺激，奖金挂帅；金钱第一，利润挂帅），大大地提高了革命职工的两条路线斗争觉悟，使我厂的生产水平创造了建厂以来的最高纪录。在提前两个月零十七天完成全年生产计划后，后两个月生产任务也连连超额完成。
    在即将过去的一年中，我厂革命和生产虽然取得了一定成绩，但是，距离毛主席对我们的要求还差得很远。我们决心乘新的氢弹试验成功的浩荡东风，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步全面落实党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，用抓革命、促生产的优异成绩迎接党的第九次代表大会的胜利召开。
