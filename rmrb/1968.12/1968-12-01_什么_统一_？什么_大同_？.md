The traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi has been peddling the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" everywhere. Domestically, he has thrown himself into the arms of the landlords and capitalists, shouting about how "China's enemies—imperialism, the Kuomintang, and the bureaucratic capitalists—have fled, been eliminated, and no longer exist." He claims that "the basic class struggle has ended, and the country's primary task now is to organize social life," and so on. In April 1963, during his "visit" to Indonesia, he became thick as thieves with the butcher of the Indonesian people, Nasution, and the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie. He pandered to these reactionaries by peddling the repackaged "theory of the extinction of class struggle."

In a meeting in Bali, he said, "As a nation, the desire for unity is understandable. After all, the world will eventually move towards great harmony!" What kind of national "unity"? Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle issue." Yet Liu Shaoqi avoids the essence of class struggle and talks about national "unity." Does he think the proletariat and the bourgeoisie can "unite"? Does he think the Indonesian people and the Indonesian reactionaries can "unite"? These are shameless lies and absurdities to the extreme.

What is this "great harmony" of the world? Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Overthrowing the old social system and establishing a new social system, that is, the socialist system, is a great struggle, a great change in the social system and the mutual relationships of people." Yet Liu Shaoqi avoids the fact that imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are colluding to seize the world and refuses to talk about the great struggle to overthrow the old society and build a new society. He abstractly talks about the "great harmony" of the world. In essence, he wants to achieve "great harmony" with the bourgeoisie and "great harmony" with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Ghosts and monsters must be let out of their cages to be annihilated, and poisonous weeds must be uprooted to be eradicated." We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and uproot Liu Shaoqi's peddled "theory of the extinction of class struggle," as well as the poisonous film "Visiting Indonesia" that praises him!

    什么“统一”？什么“大同”？
    郭崇华
    刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼，到处推销“阶级斗争熄灭论”的黑货。在国内，他投入地主、资本家的怀抱，叫嚷什么“中国的敌人——帝国主义、国民党、官僚资本家跑掉了，消灭了，没有了。”“阶级斗争基本结束，……今后国家最主要的任务是组织社会生活”，等等。一九六三年四月，他在印尼“访问”期间，又和屠杀印尼人民的刽子手纳苏蒂安以及印尼的资产阶级的头面人物打得火热，迎合这些反动家伙的口味，大肆推销换了牌子的“阶级斗争熄灭论”的黑货。他在巴厘的会议上说什么“作为一个民族，主张统一的心情，是可以理解的，将来世界总是要走向大同嘛！”
    什么民族“统一”？伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”而刘少奇却避开阶级斗争的实质，去谈什么民族“统一”。难道无产阶级和资产阶级能够“统一”？难道印尼人民与印尼反动派能够“统一”？真是无耻谰言，荒谬至极。
    什么世界“大同”？伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“推翻旧的社会制度，建立新的社会制度，即社会主义制度，这是一场伟大的斗争，是社会制度和人的相互关系的一场大变动。”而刘少奇却避开帝、修、反相互勾结妄想霸占全球的事实，闭口不谈推翻旧社会、建立新社会的伟大的斗争，抽象地说什么世界“大同”？说穿了，他是想和资产阶级搞“大同”，想和帝、修、反搞“大同”。
    毛主席教导我们：“牛鬼蛇神只有让它们出笼，才好歼灭它们，毒草只有让他们出土，才便于锄掉。”我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把刘少奇所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，以及为他树碑立传的毒草影片《访问印度尼西亚》，一起连根锄掉！
