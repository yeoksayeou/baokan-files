We Must Pay Attention to "Outside Affairs"

The great traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates the idea of "two ears deaf to outside affairs, one heart solely devoted to studying the classics," which is a thoroughly reactionary fallacy. He intends to lead us young people astray, making us indifferent to politics, unwilling to engage in class struggle, and neglectful in supervising a handful of class enemies. In our team, there is an unrepentant landlord who, in the past, we were unaware of his crimes and did not keep an eye on him. He would strut around in front of us. Through this educational revolution, an old poor peasant conducted class education for us, exposing this landlord's true colors. We Red Guards then dragged him out for struggle sessions, supervising him. This fellow had no choice but to lower his head and admit his guilt, daring not to cause any more trouble. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised us, saying: "The Red Guards did the right thing. Such 'outside affairs' must be inquired about every day and managed every day!"

    一定要管“窗外事”
    大叛徒刘少奇宣扬什么“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，这是彻头彻尾的反革命谬论。他就是想把我们青少年引向不问政治，不搞阶级斗争，不去监管一小撮阶级敌人。我们队里有个没有改造好的地主分子，过去我们不知道他的罪恶，没有管他，他在我们面前就大摇大摆。经过这次教育革命，老贫农向我们进行阶级教育，揭了这个地主分子的底，我们红小兵就把他揪出来批斗，对他进行监督，这个家伙只好低头认罪，不敢乱说乱动了。贫下中农夸赞我们说：“红小兵做得对，这种‘窗外事’要天天问，日日管！”
