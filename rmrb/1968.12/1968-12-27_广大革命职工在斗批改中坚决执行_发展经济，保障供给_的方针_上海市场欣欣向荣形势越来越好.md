Revolutionary workers across Shanghai are firmly implementing the policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" during the struggle, criticism, and reform. The market in Shanghai is thriving and the situation is getting better and better.

Many stores are establishing a socialist business ideology and attitude, enthusiastically serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 26th, the revolutionary workers on the financial and commercial front in Shanghai, during the great wave of struggle, criticism, and reform, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's economic and financial work policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply." They have vigorously organized the supply of goods and actively ensured the supply, making the entire city's market present a thriving revolutionary scene.

Since this year, Shanghai has entered the peak season, and the market situation has been getting better and better. From the large department stores on Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road to the supply and marketing cooperatives scattered throughout the suburban countryside, the goods are abundant, and both sales and purchases are brisk. The supply of staple foods such as rice, noodles, and bread is very sufficient. The supply of subsidiary foods such as pork, mutton, sugar, cigarettes, and alcohol is also ample. In the fruit stores, there are apples, pears, and sugarcane from various places. Winter goods are even more abundant and varied, with items like sanitary underwear, cotton and wool sweaters, woolen sweaters, cotton clothes, scarves, gloves, cotton shoes, hats, and dark cotton cloth, all of which are colorful and selling well. Since this year, the market prices in Shanghai have been stable, effectively guaranteeing the normal needs of the broad masses of people.

A ship sails with a helmsman, and a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The increasingly good situation in Shanghai's market is the result of the revolutionary masses in various fronts in Shanghai actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the result of a full harvest in agricultural production and a leap in industrial production. Especially, the working class in Shanghai has been vigorously carrying out the revolution and promoting production, providing a solid material foundation for Shanghai's market. From January to November this year, the total value of daily industrial products purchased by various commercial procurement and supply stations in Shanghai increased by 8% compared to the same period last year. Daily industrial products produced in Shanghai, in addition to supplying the local market, are also being shipped in large quantities to support the urban and rural markets across the country.

Under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary workers on the financial and commercial front in Shanghai have set up classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, and launched a new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly review the class struggle history of their units, conduct extensive investigations and research, and firmly grasp the work of cleaning up the class ranks, striking a small handful of class enemies accurately and decisively. Many units, in the course of deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism, have linked the class enemies and traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders like Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, making the flames of revolutionary criticism burn more fiercely. The Shanghai Needle and Cotton Textile Products and Textile Products Procurement and Supply Station, together with relevant factories, conducted investigations and research, carried out revolutionary criticism, and reformed unreasonable regulations that hindered production development. On the basis of continuous leaps in industrial production, the procurement plans for these two procurement and supply stations have been completed ahead of schedule and in excess this year, supplying more needle and cotton textile products and textiles to the peak season market.

Many retail store workers have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "the question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle," recognizing that facing the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving them is the direction of the struggle, criticism, and reform in retail stores. Many stores have launched the "three inspections" activity, inspecting whether the business hours are convenient for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, whether the service attitude has established class feelings towards the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and whether the service direction meets the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Through the "three inspections," they have thoroughly criticized the capitalist business ideology and business practices, and established socialist business ideology and business practices. Now, retail stores across the city have basically abolished the "store rest" system of one day per week, and have reasonably adjusted the business hours according to the actual situations of different areas, different industries, and different stores and counters. Many so-called "characteristic stores" and "high-end restaurants" that have been detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers have now shifted their focus to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary workers are also actively improving the display of store windows, making the windows not only highlight proletarian politics but also reflect the great achievements of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants in grasping the revolution and promoting production.

    广大革命职工在斗批改中坚决执行“发展经济，保障供给”的方针
    上海市场欣欣向荣形势越来越好
    许多商店大立社会主义经营思想和作风，热情为工农兵服务
    据新华社上海二十六日电　上海财贸战线广大革命职工在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，遵循伟大领袖毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的经济工作和财政工作的总方针，大力组织货源，积极做好供应工作，全市市场出现一派欣欣向荣的革命景象。
    今年上海进入旺季以来，市场形势越来越好。从南京路、淮海路上的大商店到遍布郊区农村的供销社，商品丰富，购销两旺。大米、面条、面包等主食品的供应十分充沛。猪肉、羊肉、食糖、纸烟、酒等副食品的供应也很充足。在水果店里，摆满了来自各地的苹果、生梨、甘蔗等。冬令百货更是丰富多采，卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤、羊毛衫、棉衣、围巾、手套、棉鞋、帽子以及深色棉布等商品，花色繁多，销售活跃。今年以来，上海市市场物价稳定，有力地保证了广大人民生活的正常需要。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。上海市场越来越好的形势，是上海各条战线广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想的结果，是农业生产全面丰收和工业生产飞跃发展的结果。特别是上海工人阶级狠抓革命，猛促生产，为上海市场提供了丰厚的物质基础。今年一月到十一月，上海各商业采购供应站收购日用工业品的总值，比去年同期增长百分之八。上海市生产的日用工业品，除供应本地市场外，大批源源外运，支援全国城乡市场。
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，上海财贸战线广大革命职工，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，大忆本单位的阶级斗争史，大搞调查研究，狠抓清理阶级队伍的工作，做到稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。许多单位在深入开展革命大批判中，把挖出来的阶级敌人和叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货挂上钩，使革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。上海针棉织品、纺织品采购供应站还同有关工厂一道调查研究，一道开展革命大批判，一道改革束缚生产发展的不合理的规章制度。在工业生产不断跃进的基础上，这两个采购供应站今年的采购计划已经提前超额完成，以更多的针棉织品和纺织品供应旺季市场。
    许多零售商店的革命职工，认真学习了毛主席关于“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题”的伟大教导，认识到面向工农兵，为工农兵服务是零售商店斗、批、改的方向。许多商店开展了“三查”活动，查营业时间是否方便工农兵，查服务态度是否对工农兵树立了阶级感情，查服务方向是否符合工农兵的需要。通过“三查”，大破资本主义的经营思想和经营作风，大立社会主义的经营思想和经营作风。现在，全市零售商店基本上取消了每周一天的“店休”制度，根据不同地段、不同行业、不同商店和柜组的实际情况，合理地调整了营业时间。不少脱离工农兵群众的所谓“特色商店”、“高级饭店”，现在已把立足点移到为工农兵服务这个方向上来。广大革命职工还积极改进商店橱窗的陈列，使橱窗既突出无产阶级政治，又反映工人阶级和贫下中农抓革命，促生产的巨大成果。
