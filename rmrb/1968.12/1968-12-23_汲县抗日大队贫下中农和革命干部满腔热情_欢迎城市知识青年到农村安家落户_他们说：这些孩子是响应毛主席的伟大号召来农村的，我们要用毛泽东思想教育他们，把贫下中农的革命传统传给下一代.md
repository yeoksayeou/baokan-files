The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Anti-Japanese Brigade in Xixian County, Henan Province, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility, have been steadfastly using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to educate the urban youth who have come to the countryside. They help them grow and temper themselves in the storms of class struggle in the countryside.

In August 1965, the Anti-Japanese Brigade in Tangzhuang Commune, Xixian County, welcomed over a thousand poor and lower-middle peasants with drums and gongs. They welcomed more than twenty new commune members. These new members were urban youth who, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "go to the countryside and work there," came to the countryside with revolutionary enthusiasm from the county seat to settle down. They were all junior high school and middle school graduates who had just left school. The cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade, with deep class feelings, said: "These children came to the countryside in response to Chairman Mao's great call. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to educate them and pass on the revolutionary traditions of the poor and lower-middle peasants to the next generation."

After this batch of urban youth arrived at the Anti-Japanese Brigade, the original brigade party branch secretary and current brigade revolutionary committee chairman, Zhang Shude, with his deep hatred for the old society and his deep love for the new society, told them the village history in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Then, he led them to visit the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants to inquire about their hardships and invited the old poor peasant Zhao Zhenhua, who had been injured in the left arm by the Japanese imperialists, to tell the story of his family's bitter history in the old society. Later, the party branch also had them eat bitter meals with over five hundred poor and lower-middle peasants in the village, reminisce about the past, and together condemn the evil old society. The class education of reminiscing about the past and thinking about the sweetness greatly raised the class consciousness of the urban youth who had come down to the countryside, laying a solid ideological foundation for them to take root in the countryside. The urban youth Liu Shiping originally did not want to herd sheep, thinking that herding sheep was a "shameful" and "dirty" job. The old shepherd Li Shulin, who had carried the yoke for half his life in the old society, told Liu Shiping the bitter history of herding sheep for the landlord, making Liu Shiping realize that herding sheep was neither shameful nor dirty, but his own thoughts were "shameful" and "dirty." He took the old shepherd Li Shulin as his teacher and decided to herd sheep for the revolution. Now, Liu Shiping has increased from herding thirty sheep to over eighty sheep and has also learned to treat and deliver sheep, becoming a good shepherd.

To make this batch of urban youth advance on the bright road indicated by Chairman Mao in the vast countryside, the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of the Anti-Japanese Brigade implemented the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin on the "four firsts," timely grasping the various active thoughts of the urban youth, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to educate them. From the day these urban youth entered the village, the brigade party branch closely cared for their ideological trends. These youths had not been in the village for long when, one day, the party branch secretary Zhang Shude discovered from their conversations before and after meals that a few urban youths were wavering in their thoughts about staying in the countryside and wanted to return to the city. He immediately went to talk to these youths, leading them to study Chairman Mao's teachings in combination with their own thoughts: "The countryside is a vast world, where one can achieve great things." "How do you judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do you use? What do you use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually does unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's great teachings and the patient education of the poor and lower-middle peasants deeply educated these urban youths, and they firmly decided to stay in the countryside for life.

The cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of the Anti-Japanese Brigade, to better educate these urban youths, also adopted the method of home visits, establishing close contact with the parents of the urban youths, and solving problems together. They provided targeted help and education to the urban youths who had come down to the countryside.

The brigade party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants paid special attention to educating these urban youths about class struggle, making them grow into revolutionary pioneers in the actual class struggle. A small handful of untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in this brigade saw that the urban youths were growing up healthily under the education of the brigade cadres and the poor and lower-middle peasants, and they were terrified. On the one hand, they used various means to maliciously incite the urban youths not to settle down in the countryside, and on the other hand, they used telling old stories and reciting old books to instill feudal poison into the urban youths, trying to corrupt their souls. After learning of this situation, the brigade party branch immediately convened a meeting of the urban youths who had come down to the countryside, combining the specific situation of the brigade, and educated the youths to heighten their vigilance. The education of the poor and lower-middle peasants made the urban youths further establish the concept of class struggle. They angrily exposed and fought against the sabotage activities of the class enemies.

After these more than twenty urban youths came to the Anti-Japanese Brigade, the brigade specially selected a person with high political awareness, work ability, and agricultural production experience from eleven production teams to be their team leader. They also selected five old poor peasants who had deep bitterness in the old society and had agricultural production experience from the entire brigade to study Chairman Mao's works with them, pass on production experience, and conduct class education and production labor education on them at any time. Now, the youths have learned various agricultural production techniques, established deep proletarian feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and deeply rooted themselves in the vast countryside. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they insisted on making a revolution on the spot in the countryside. They said: "The Anti-Japanese Brigade is our battlefield for the three great revolutionary movements. We will take root here and continue the struggle." In the past three years, they have not only won victories in political and ideological struggles but also in production struggles. In the autumn of 1967, they created a large-area high-yield record in more than fifty mu of corn fields, harvesting 560 jin in an eighth-mu corn test field, creating the highest yield in the history of this brigade.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianzhu Gorge Brigade in Yongdian Commune, Liaoning Province, care for and educate the urban youths who have come down to the countryside politically. This is the old poor peasant Ren Qingfa studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the urban youths who have come down to the countryside.

    汲县抗日大队贫下中农和革命干部满腔热情
    欢迎城市知识青年到农村安家落户
    他们说：这些孩子是响应毛主席的伟大号召来农村的，我们要用毛泽东思想教育他们，把贫下中农的革命传统传给下一代
    据新华社郑州二十一日电　河南省汲县唐庄公社抗日大队的干部和贫下中农，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，以高度的革命责任感，坚持用战无不胜的毛泽东思想教育下乡的知识青年，帮助他们在农村阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼成长。
    一九六五年八月，汲县唐庄公社抗日大队锣鼓喧天，一千多名贫下中农迎来了二十多名新社员。这些新社员是响应毛主席“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”伟大号召，满怀革命豪情，从县城来农村安家落户的知识青年。他们都是刚刚离开学校的高小、初中毕业生。大队的干部和贫下中农满怀着深厚的阶级感情说：“这些孩子是响应毛主席的伟大号召来农村的，我们要用毛泽东思想教育他们，把贫下中农的革命传统传给下一代。”
    这批知识青年到抗日大队后，原大队党支部书记、现大队革委会主任张树德就以对旧社会无比憎恨和对新社会无比热爱的感情，在毛主席像前向他们讲述了村史。接着，又领着他们到贫下中农家里访贫问苦，请当年曾被日本帝国主义者刺伤左臂的老贫农赵振华讲述他家在旧社会的血泪家史。后来，党支部又让他们和全村五百多名贫下中农一起吃忆苦饭，一起忆苦思甜，共同控诉万恶的旧社会。忆苦思甜的阶级教育，大大提高了下乡知识青年的阶级觉悟，为他们在农村扎根打下了坚实的思想基础。知识青年刘世平原来不愿放羊，认为放羊是“丑”事，是“脏”活。解放前扛了大半辈子长工的老放羊手李树林，就给刘世平讲他在旧社会给地主放羊的辛酸史，使刘世平认识到放羊的事既不丑又不脏，而是自己的思想“丑”和“脏”。他拜老羊工李树林为师，决心为革命放羊。现在，刘世平已由开始时放三十只羊增加到八十多只羊，还学会了给羊治病、接生，成了一名好放羊工。
    为了使这批知识青年在农村广阔的天地里沿着毛主席指引的光辉道路阔步前进，抗日大队的干部和贫下中农贯彻执行林副主席“四个第一”的指示，及时抓住知识青年的各种活思想，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想对他们进行教育。从这些知识青年进村的第一天起，大队党支部就密切地关怀着他们的思想动向。这些青年刚来不久，有一次党支部书记张树德从知识青年们饭前、饭后的议论中，发现有几个知识青年思想上对在农村发生了动摇，想回城市去。他立即去找这些青年谈心，领着他们结合自己的思想实际，反复学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”毛主席的伟大教导，贫下中农的耐心教育，使这些知识青年受到了深刻的教育，他们坚定了在农村干一辈子的决心。
    抗日大队的干部和贫下中农为了更好地对这些知识青年进行教育，还采取家庭访问的办法，和知识青年的家长建立密切联系，有问题共同解决。有针对性地对下乡的知识青年进行帮助、教育。
    大队党支部和贫下中农特别注意对这些下乡知识青年进行阶级斗争的教育，使他们在现实的阶级斗争中成长为革命的闯将。这个大队一小撮没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，看到知识青年在大队干部和贫下中农的教育下健康地成长起来，怕得要命，吓得要死。他们一方面采取各种手段恶毒煽动知识青年不安心留在农村，同时又利用讲旧故事、说旧书等手段，向知识青年灌输封建主义毒素，妄图腐蚀知识青年的灵魂。大队党支部了解这一情况后，马上召集下乡知识青年开会，结合本队的具体情况，教育青年们提高警惕。贫下中农的教育，使知识青年们进一步树立了阶级斗争的观念。他们对阶级敌人的破坏活动进行了愤怒的揭发和斗争。
    这二十多个知识青年到抗日大队以后，大队特地从十一个生产队中挑选了一个政治觉悟高、有工作能力和农业生产经验的人担任他们的队长，并从全大队抽出五名在旧社会苦大仇深、又有生产经验的老贫农，和他们一起学习毛主席著作，传授生产经验，对他们随时随地进行阶级教育和生产劳动教育。现在，青年们已经学会了多种农业生产技术，和贫下中农建立了深厚的无产阶级感情，在农村这个广阔的天地里深深扎下了根。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们坚持在农村就地闹革命，他们说：“抗日大队就是我们搞三大革命运动的阵地，我们要在这里扎根，在这里坚持斗争。”三年来，他们不仅在政治思想上打了胜仗，在生产斗争上也打了胜仗。一九六七年秋天他们在五十多亩玉米地里创造了大面积丰产纪录，在八分玉米试验田里打了五百六十斤，创造了这个大队历史上的最高产量。（附图片）
