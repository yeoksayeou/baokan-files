The working class of Zhejiang Province is vigorously pushing forward the revolution and vigorously promoting production. The province is continuously receiving reports of batches of factories and mines completing and overfulfilling this year's national production plan ahead of schedule.

In October of this year, the revolutionary workers of 21 units, including the Hangzhou Electrochemical Factory, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, jointly issued a revolutionary initiative to the entire provincial industrial front, calling for a great battle in the fourth quarter to overfulfill this year's national production plan. Units such as the Hangzhou Electrochemical Factory, Hangzhou Agricultural Chemical Factory, Hangzhou Oil Felt Factory, and Hangzhou Canned Food Factory quickly reported the completion of the annual plan ahead of schedule. The number of units in the heavy industry, light industry, and hydroelectric systems of the entire province that have completed the annual plan ahead of schedule is increasing. Regions such as Jinhua, Shaoxing, and Jiaxing also have batches of factories and mines that have completed the annual plan ahead of schedule.
