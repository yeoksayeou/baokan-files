Afghan King Inspects Fishery Built with Chinese Aid

Afghan King Muhammad Zahir Shah inspected the Darunta Fishery Experimental Station, built with Chinese aid, on December 12th, 15th, and 19th. The King expressed great satisfaction with the work of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel.

In February of this year, the King had previously inspected the fishery. At that time, the fish fry had just arrived from China and were only about two centimeters long. Now, the fish have grown to weigh three to four pounds each. When the King saw the fish leaping and swimming in the ponds, he happily gestured with his hands and said to the accompanying Afghan officials, "The fish have grown so quickly. They were this big last time, and now they are this big. This project has been successful."

The Chinese engineering and technical personnel are currently working with Afghan workers to build wooden boats. Soon, they will be able to go out on the boats to cast nets and catch fish. The Afghan King said to the Chinese engineering and technical personnel who helped build the fishery, "The projects built with the help of Chinese friends are progressing rapidly. Chinese friends are working hard to ensure the quick completion of the projects. This is another good example."

    阿富汗国王视察中国帮助兴建的养鱼场
    对中国工程技术人员的工作表示十分满意
    新华社喀布尔二十一日电　阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿十二日、十五日、十九日连续三次视察中国帮助阿富汗兴建的达伦塔养鱼试验场。国王对中国工程技术人员的工作表示十分满意。
    阿富汗国王今年二月曾经视察过这个养鱼场。那时鱼苗刚从中国运来不久，只有两厘米长，现在鱼一般都生长到三、四斤重。当国王看到鱼池里欢蹦乱跳的大肥鱼时，高兴地用手势比量着，对随行的阿富汗官员们说：“鱼长得真快，上次这么大，现在长到这样大了。这个工程有成效。”
    中国工程技术人员正在和阿富汗工人一起赶制木船，不久就可以乘船撒网捕鱼。阿富汗国王向帮助阿富汗兴建养鱼场的中国工程技术人员说：“中国朋友帮助建设的工程项目进展很快，中国朋友认真地使工程迅速进行。你们这里也是一个好例子。”
