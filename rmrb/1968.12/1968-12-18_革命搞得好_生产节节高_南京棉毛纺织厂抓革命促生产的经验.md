The workers of the Nanjing Cotton and Wool Textile Factory, tempered by the battles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production." With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, they have always prioritized revolution, thoroughly cleaned up the class ranks, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, and vigorously promoted the ideological transformation of the people. This has effectively promoted the development of productive forces, and the production of cotton yarn has soared. In August, it increased by 89.44% compared to July, in September by 49.59% compared to August, in October by 29.57% compared to September, and in November, it saw a significant increase, up 21.8% compared to the same period in 1966, surpassing the highest production level in history.

Thoroughly Clean Up the Class Ranks to Liberate Productive Forces

The Nanjing Cotton and Wool Textile Factory was expanded in 1958 and was originally a merger of several private small factories into the Nanjing Spinning Mill. The struggle between the two classes and two lines has always been intense. During the Cultural Revolution, due to the sabotage and disruption by a handful of class enemies, production plans were once poorly completed, making it one of the backward units in the Nanjing region. After the Revolutionary Committee was established on July 10 this year, the factory summarized the reasons for the production problems and unanimously agreed that to solve the production issues, one cannot just focus on production. Only by thoroughly cleaning up the class ranks and removing obstacles can productive forces be further liberated.

How closely related are the cleanup of class ranks and production? Consider the following three incidents:

First incident: Soon after the Revolutionary Committee was established, when the entire factory's workers were ready to grasp revolution and promote production, a handful of class enemies stirred up a storm from the dark corners, saying that "focusing on production is rightist." Based on extensive investigations and research by mobilizing the masses, the Revolutionary Committee quickly exposed two troublemakers who were spreading rumors and lies. A vigorous production upsurge was soon launched.

Second incident: Just as the entire factory's production was in full swing, the spinning room was dead silent and inactive. Why? It turned out that a troublemaker had infiltrated the revolutionary leadership group of the workshop, seized leadership, suppressed revolutionary cadres, and attacked revolutionary masses, doing everything possible to sabotage production. After this troublemaker was exposed, the masses cheered, saying, "The workshop has removed a big harm, and revolutionary enthusiasm surges." The next day, the daily production of cotton yarn broke the highest record since the factory's establishment.

Third incident: The newly created production record did not last long before the absenteeism rate suddenly rose, and the daily production plummeted. According to the investigation, it turned out that a handful of troublemakers in the clinic were using their authority to deliberately sabotage production. The Revolutionary Committee immediately supported the workers' congress to send a propaganda team into the clinic to take over all powers, exposing the cover of class struggle, and production quickly rebounded.

These series of facts made everyone deeply realize that an important reason for the stagnation in production was the sabotage by the enemy. Only by removing the scabs can good flesh grow, and only by grasping class struggle can production be promoted.

Carry Out Revolutionary Criticism to Promote Production Development

While thoroughly cleaning up the class ranks, the factory Revolutionary Committee also vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism, effectively promoting production. The spinning room's Class C Group 5 was a group that the capitalist roaders had carefully cultivated in the past. Here, due to the lingering poison of the revisionist line of running enterprises pushed by the capitalist roaders, the entire group of 28 people could not work together, greatly affecting production. The factory Revolutionary Committee believed that to solve this problem, they had to further mobilize the masses and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. Thus, they set up battlefields from the workshop to the group, with everyone on the front lines, conducting revolutionary criticism every day. Soon, a lively political atmosphere of mutual help, mutual learning, and unity emerged, and production doubled. This incident made everyone clearly realize: even if the snake is gone, the poison remains. Although Liu Shaoqi has been overthrown, his revisionist line of running enterprises is still at work. Only by deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminating its poison can productive forces be further liberated.

Revolutionary criticism launched a fierce attack on the revisionist line of running enterprises, and the revolutionary masses exposed and criticized the capitalist roaders' crimes of using over 300 unreasonable rules and regulations to bind workers and using more than 20 types of bonus systems to corrupt workers, greatly promoting the development of productive forces. In recent months, the factory's production has been maintained at the highest level and has been steadily rising. Spinning worker Gao Yueying, who used to fail to complete her production tasks every month under the suppression of the capitalist roaders, now often exceeds her production tasks. They deeply felt: "If the poison is not eliminated, production cannot rise; if criticism is well done, production soars."

Vigorously Promote Ideological Transformation to Mobilize the Masses

The most active and revolutionary factor in productive forces is people. Therefore, arming workers with Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoting the ideological transformation of people, raising their political awareness, and mobilizing their enthusiasm is a fundamental issue in doing well in socialist production.

Based on the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles," the factory Revolutionary Committee vigorously carried out class education and established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Broad revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "the working class should also continuously raise its political awareness in struggles," eagerly studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, seriously transformed their worldviews, and were determined to take the initiative as masters to grasp revolution and promote production. Every new instruction from Chairman Mao and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party gave the workers great education and inspiration. They organized night study sessions to firmly implement Chairman Mao's series of new instructions. After the workers studied Chairman Mao's new instruction that "the working class must lead everything," their revolutionary enthusiasm doubled, and everyone strove to be a pioneer in "grasping revolution and promoting production," exploring every possible way to tap into production potential. Some spinning frames in the fine spinning room exceeded the historical highest speed. As the speed increased, difficulties also arose, and the phenomenon of broken threads occurred frequently. To overcome this difficulty, the workers broke away from conservative thinking and made new spindles. At the same time, the workers proactively proposed increasing shifts appropriately, expanding the inspection area, and ensuring that both people and machines do not stop. They said, "We can contribute more to the country, and this is our greatest happiness and glory."

The two-year Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised the working class's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to an unprecedented height, profoundly changing the working class's spiritual appearance. Some of them used to think of themselves only as production workers, but now they deeply realize that they are first and foremost revolutionary workers.

Currently, broad revolutionary workers are determined to further implement Chairman Mao's series of new instructions, further launch a new upsurge in revolution and production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命搞得好　生产节节高
    ——南京棉毛纺织厂抓革命促生产的经验
    经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗洗礼的南京棉毛纺织厂广大革命职工，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的教导，在中国人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，始终把革命放在首位，认真清理阶级队伍，深入开展革命大批判，狠抓人的思想革命化，有力地促进了生产力的发展，棉纱产量直线上升。八月份比七月份上升百分之八十九点四四，九月份比八月份上升百分之四十九点五九，十月份比九月份上升百分之二十九点五七，十一月份又有大幅度增长，比一九六六年同期增长百分之二十一点八，超过了历史上最高生产水平。
    认真清理阶级队伍　解放生产力
    南京棉毛纺织厂是一九五八年扩建的，它的前身是几个私营小厂合并建成的南京纱厂。这个厂两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，一直很激烈。文化大革命中，由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，一度生产计划完成很差，成为南京地区的后进单位之一。今年七月十日革委会建立以后，总结了过去生产上不去的原因，一致认为，要解决生产问题，不能就生产抓生产，只有认真清理好阶级队伍，扫除障碍，才能进一步解放生产力。
    清理阶级队伍究竟和生产有多大的利害关系？请看以下三桩事：第一桩事，革委会刚成立不久，全厂职工要起来抓革命、促生产的时候，一小撮阶级敌人从阴暗的角落里刮起了一阵妖风，说什么“抓生产是右倾”。革委会在放手发动群众深入调查研究的基础上，一举揪出了煽阴风、点鬼火、散布流言蜚语的两个坏家伙，一个轰轰烈烈的生产高潮就很快掀起来了。第二桩事，正当全厂的生产搞得热火朝天，筒摇车间却是死气沉沉，按兵不动。什么原因呢？原来是一个坏家伙混进了车间革命领导小组，篡夺了领导权，压制革命干部，打击革命群众，千方百计破坏生产。这个坏家伙被揪出来以后，群众拍手称快，说：“车间除了一大害，革命干劲涌上来。”第二天棉纱生产的日产量就打破了建厂以来的最高纪录。第三桩事，创新的生产纪录保持没多久，缺勤率突然上升，日产量急剧下降。根据调查，原来是卫生所里有一小撮坏家伙，利用职权，有意破坏生产。革委会立即支持工代会派工人宣传队开进卫生所，接管一切大权，揭开了阶级斗争的盖子，生产又很快地上去了。
    这一系列事实，使大家深刻地认识到，生产上不去的一个重要原因就是因为有敌人捣鬼，只有揭掉脓包盖子，才能长出好肉，只有抓好阶级斗争，才能推动生产的发展。
    开展革命大批判　促进生产发展
    在认真清理阶级队伍的同时，厂革委会还狠抓革命大批判，有力地推动了生产。筒摇车间丙班五组是厂内走资派过去苦心经营的一个班组，在这里，由于走资派所推行的修正主义办企业路线的流毒没有肃清，全组二十八个人不能协同一致，生产受到很大影响。厂革委会认为，要解决这个问题，就得进一步放手发动群众，深入开展革命大批判。于是，他们从车间到班组，处处摆战场，人人上火线，天天搞革命大批判。这样，很快就出现了一个互相帮助，互相学习，大家团结一致的生动活泼的政治局面，生产跃增一倍。这件事使大家清楚地认识到：蛇不在，毒还存。刘少奇虽然被打倒了，他推行的那套修正主义企业路线还在起作用。只有深入地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清其流毒，才能进一步解放生产力。
    革命的大批判向修正主义的一套办企业路线发起了猛烈的冲击，广大革命职工揭发批判了厂内走资派用三百多条管、卡、扣、压的不合理的规章制度束缚工人，用二十多种奖金制度来腐蚀工人的滔天罪行，大大地促进了生产力的发展。近月来，全厂生产一直保持在最高产量水平，并且持续地稳步上升。挡车工高月英过去在走资派的压制下，月月完不成生产任务；现在她却经常超额完成生产任务。他们深有体会地说：“流毒肃不清，生产无法升；批判搞得好，生产节节高。”
    狠抓思想革命化　调动群众积极性
    生产力中最活跃最革命的因素是人。因此，用毛泽东思想武装工人，狠抓人的思想革命化，提高人的政治觉悟，调动人的积极性，是搞好社会主义生产的一个根本问题。
    厂革委会根据伟大领袖毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，狠抓阶级教育，大办毛泽东思想学习班。广大革命职工遵照毛主席“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，如饥似渴地活学活用毛泽东思想，认真地改造自己的世界观，决心以主人翁的姿态抓好革命，促好生产。毛主席每条最新指示和党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，都给工人以极大的教育和鼓舞，他们连夜组织学习，坚决落实毛主席一系列最新指示。当工人们学习了毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示后，革命干劲倍增，人人争当“抓革命，促生产”的闯将，千方百计地挖掘生产潜力。细纱车间有些机台车速超过了历史上的最高水平。车速加快了，困难也增加了，断头现象不断发生，工人们为了克服这个困难，大破保守思想，自制新的锭胆。在这同时，工人们又主动提出适当增加班次，扩大看台，做到人机两不停。他们说：“我们能为国家多做一点贡献，这是我们的最大幸福和光荣。”
    两年来的无产阶级文化大革命，把工人阶级的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟提高到了一个空前的高度，使工人阶级的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。他们之中有些人过去只认为自己是个生产工人，现在他们深刻认识到自己首先是个革命工人。
    目前，广大革命职工决心进一步落实毛主席一系列最新指示，进一步掀起革命和生产的新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
