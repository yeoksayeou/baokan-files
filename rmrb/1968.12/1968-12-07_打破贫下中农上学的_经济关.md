The traitor Liu Shaoqi charged high fees in schools, using economic means to prevent the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from attending. His agents in the Ministry of Education openly advocated the bourgeois slogan of "whoever studies, pays."

Historically, the bourgeoisie, under the slogan of "whoever studies, pays," monopolized education in schools, oppressing us poor and lower-middle peasants. The Liu Shaoqi clique peddling bourgeois goods clearly shows that he is a thoroughgoing representative of the landlords and bourgeoisie. Because of the various fees schools charge, the high tuition standards set, the children of landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists have no difficulty studying, but it is difficult for us poor and lower-middle peasants to pay the high tuition. "Whoever studies, pays" actually means excluding our children from school. My son was one of those excluded.

In the past, my family suffered generation after generation. The landlords treated us like cattle and horses. My two sisters and I were sold off as children, and my father was driven to death by debt collectors. Thinking of these things, my heart is always filled with indignation. In that wicked old society, we didn't even dare to think about studying.

The East is red, the sun is rising, Chairman Mao has come, and saved our family. Chairman Mao is our greatest benefactor. Chairman Mao also wants us to care about national affairs, and we must read Chairman Mao's books to understand how to care about national affairs. Therefore, I decided to send my son to school. However, as soon as the child went to school, there were all sorts of fees, and the tuition was high. One semester alone required a lot of money. My family has few laborers, and our finances are tight. My child went to school without money, and the bad elements in the school did not let the child attend classes and made him stand as punishment, allowing the landlords and rich peasants to laugh and ridicule him. But I always thought, if the child can read, he can read Chairman Mao's books and follow Chairman Mao in the revolution, so I still wanted the child to go to school. Once, the school came to collect money again, and I requested a one-week delay, but the school refused. That day, I happened to have business and passed by the school, seeing my child standing outside. The child saw me and cried, saying, "The teacher won't let me go in to class, and I have to think about it." At that moment, I was so angry, thinking, what fault does the child have? I gritted my teeth and said to the child, "There's nothing to think about, this school is not for us poor and lower-middle peasants!" I angrily took the child home. Look, this is how vicious and harsh the Liu Shaoqi clique is to us poor and lower-middle peasants! Now Liu Shaoqi has been thoroughly overthrown, and we must stomp on him again to ensure he never rises again!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." In the past, the cultural power was in the hands of the Liu Shaoqi clique, and they would inevitably oppress us poor and lower-middle peasants. Now that we poor and lower-middle peasants are managing the schools, we must thoroughly criticize the reactionary fallacies of the Liu Shaoqi clique's "whoever studies, pays" and let all our children be able to attend school.

    打破贫下中农上学的“经济关”
    老贫农、学习毛主席著作积极分子　唐凤英
    大叛徒刘少奇在学校里收高费，用经济手段阻止贫下中农子女入学。他在教育部的代理人还公开鼓吹资产阶级“谁上学谁出钱”的口号。
    在历史上，资产阶级就是在“谁上学谁出钱”的口号下，在学校里专了我们贫下中农的政。刘少奇一伙贩运资产阶级黑货，正说明他是不折不扣的地主、资产阶级总代表。由于学校要这样费，要那样费，把学费标准订得高高的，地主、富农、资本家子女读书不困难，可是我们贫下中农要拿出高学费就比较困难。“谁上学谁出钱”，实际上就是要把我们贫下中农子女排斥在学校门外。我的儿子就是被排斥的一个。
    过去，我家世世代代受苦受累，地主把我们当牛作马。我和两个妹妹从小就被卖给人家，父亲被债主逼债急得吐血而死。想起这些事，我的心里总是愤愤不平。在那万恶的旧社会里，我们对读书连想也不敢想。
    东方红，太阳升，毛主席来了，救了我们一家。毛主席是我们最大最大的恩人。毛主席还要我们关心国家大事，我们必须读毛主席的书，才懂得怎样关心国家大事。因此，我决定把儿子送去上学。那知孩子一到学校，这样费，那样费，一动就是费、费、费，又多又高，一学期就要好多钱。我家因劳动力少，经济上比较紧些。我孩子上学没有带钱，学校里的坏家伙就不让孩子上课，还要罚站，让地、富分子笑话、奚落。但是，我一心想，孩子识了字，能读毛主席的书，跟毛主席他老人家干革命，还是要让孩子上学。有一次学校又来要钱，我要求缓一个星期，学校高低不同意。那天我正好有事，路过学校，看到我的孩子站在外面。孩子见到我，哭着说：“老师不让我进去上课，要我想想。”当时，我气急了，心想，孩子有什么错呢？我咬咬牙对孩子说：“没有什么好想的，这个学校不是为我们贫下中农办的！”我就这样愤愤地把孩子带回了家。看，刘少奇之流对我们贫下中农就是这样的狠毒，就是这样的苛刻！现在刘少奇被彻底打倒了，我们要再踏上一只脚，叫他永世不得翻身！
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”过去，文权掌握在刘少奇之流手里，他们必然要专我们贫下中农的政。现在我们贫下中农管理学校了，一定要彻底批判刘少奇一伙“谁上学谁出钱”的反动谬论，让我们贫下中农的子女都能上学。
