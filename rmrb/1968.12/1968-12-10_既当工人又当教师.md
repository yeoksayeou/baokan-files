Regarding the question of what to do with urban primary schools and middle schools, we follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings that the working class must lead everything. We believe that urban primary schools and middle schools should also be transferred to factories and neighborhoods for management. Our views are as follows:

1. Transferring urban middle schools to factories and urban primary schools to neighborhoods can embody the great leader Chairman Mao's consistent thoughts on factory-run schools and mass-run schools, making schools a part of factories and neighborhoods. This approach helps the working class and the revolutionary masses of the city firmly grasp the power of education, thoroughly smashing the revisionist educational system.

2. It is beneficial for intellectuals to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause. With the working class and revolutionary masses in control of educational power, they can use Mao Zedong Thought to transform everything in the school. At the same time, teachers and students living among the working class and revolutionary masses every day can learn more from the working class and revolutionary masses, accelerating the revolutionization of their thoughts.

3. After factories and neighborhoods run schools, teachers can implement a system of half-work and half-teaching, serving as both school teachers and factory workers. Students can also implement a system of half-work and half-study. This approach can closely integrate education with productive labor.

4. It is beneficial to change the class composition of the teaching staff. Transferring urban primary schools and middle schools to neighborhoods and factories means that the working class will control personnel arrangements. The working class and revolutionary masses can, according to revolutionary needs, supervise or transfer teachers with impure thoughts and irresponsible work. They can select advanced workers who are loyal to Chairman Mao and have practical experience, as well as revolutionary young intellectuals with good class backgrounds who have worked for a few years and shown good performance, to become teachers, thereby establishing a new type of teaching staff.

In the future, factories can stop or reduce the recruitment of temporary workers and apprentices. Middle school teachers' salaries will be paid by the factories, and primary school teachers' salaries will be raised by the neighborhoods. Neighborhoods generally also have small factories, and neighborhood-run primary schools can have teachers and students work in neighborhood factories, implementing half-work and half-teaching, half-work and half-study. For a small number of teachers with economic difficulties, the state can provide appropriate subsidies.

    既当工人又当教师
    对于城市小学和中学应当怎么办的问题，我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的教导，认为城市小学和中学也应下放到工厂和街道去办。我们的看法是：
    一、城市中学下放到工厂办，城市小学下放到街道办，可以体现伟大领袖毛主席的厂办学校和群众办学的一贯思想，使学校成为工厂和街道的一部分。这样做，有利于工人阶级和城市的广大革命群众牢牢掌握文权，彻底摧毁修正主义的教育体制。
    二、有利于知识分子接受工农兵的再教育，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。工人阶级和革命群众掌握了教育大权，就可以用毛泽东思想改造学校的一切。同时，师生每天都生活在工人阶级和革命群众之中，可以更多地向工人阶级学习，向革命群众学习，加速思想革命化。
    三、工厂办学校、街道办学校后，教师可以实行半工半教，既是学校里的教师，又是工厂里的工人。学生也可以实行半工半读。这样做，可以使教育紧密地与生产劳动相结合。
    四、有利于改变教师队伍的阶级成份。城市小学和中学下放到街道、工厂办，人事调配权也就由工人阶级掌握，工人阶级和革命群众就可以根据革命的需要，对那些思想不纯、工作不负责的教师进行监督或调动，而选拔忠于毛主席、有实践经验的先进工人和成份好、又经过几年劳动、表现好的革命知识青年担任教师，从而建立一支新型的教师队伍。
    今后，工厂可以不招或少招临时工、徒工。中学教师工资由工厂发，小学教师工资由街道筹集。街道一般也有小型工厂，街道办小学，师生可到街道工厂劳动，实行半工半教，半工半读。少数教师家庭经济有困难的，可由国家给予适当补助。
