The revolutionary workers of the Shidian Paper Mill in Jilin Province, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have been vigorously promoting revolution and production. They have completed the annual production task of paper for printing the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao 52 days ahead of schedule.

The revolutionary workers of the Shidian Paper Mill, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. While working by the machines, their hearts are with the red sun, their minds are with all of China, and their eyes are on the world. They are determined to produce more and better paper for printing the portraits of Chairman Mao, so that more revolutionary people can see the brilliant image of Chairman Mao. At the beginning of this year, due to the severe cold and shortage of water sources affecting production, the entire factory faced the danger of shutdown. The workers braved the cold, jumped into the icy water, broke the ice to draw water, and ensured the normal production of paper for printing the portraits of Chairman Mao. The beater of this factory is an old piece of equipment, and the pulp it produces is of poor quality, affecting the quality of the product. The workers pooled their wisdom, took matters into their own hands, and made a continuous beater to replace the old equipment. This not only greatly improved the product quality but also saved manpower, reduced costs, and decreased the consumption of raw materials.

    石岘造纸厂提前完成印制毛主席画像用纸任务
    吉林省石岘造纸厂广大革命职工，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前五十二天完成了印制伟大领袖毛主席画像用纸的全年生产任务。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的石岘造纸厂广大革命职工，对毛主席最忠。他们身在机器旁，心向红太阳，胸怀全中国，放眼全世界，决心生产出更多更好的印制毛主席画像用纸，让更多的革命人民能看到毛主席的光辉形象。今年年初，因天气严寒水源严重不足影响生产，全厂面临停产危险。工人们冒着严寒，跳进刺骨的水中，破冰引水，保证了印制毛主席画像用纸的正常生产。这个厂的打浆机是个老设备，打出的纸浆质量低，影响产品质量。工人们就群策群力，自己动手制造成连续打浆机代替了老设备，不仅大大提高了产品质量，而且节省了人力，降低了成本，减少了原材料消耗。
