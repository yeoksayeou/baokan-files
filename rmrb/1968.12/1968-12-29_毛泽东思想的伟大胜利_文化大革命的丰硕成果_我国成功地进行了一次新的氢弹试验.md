We are filled with great joy and warmly celebrate the success of this hydrogen bomb test. It is a significant gift to the upcoming Ninth National Congress of the Party, marking a new leap in the development of our country's nuclear weapons.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission extend warm congratulations to the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, scientists, and all relevant personnel involved in the research and testing of nuclear weapons! We hope that everyone will remain humble and press on, holding high the great red banner of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Let us make new and greater contributions to accelerating the development of our national defense science and technology and achieving the modernization of our national defense!

The success of China's latest hydrogen bomb test is another blow to the nuclear threats and blackmail policies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. It greatly encourages and supports the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries.

New China News Agency, December 28th

In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's march towards comprehensive victory and under the great encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, on December 27, 1968, China successfully conducted a new thermonuclear test by detonating a hydrogen bomb in the western region of the country.

This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another rich harvest of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a significant gift to the upcoming Ninth National Congress of the Party. We are filled with great joy and warmly celebrate the success of this hydrogen bomb test, which marks a new leap in the development of our country's nuclear weapons.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development taken by other countries, crawling step by step behind others. We must break the rules and adopt advanced technology as much as possible to build our country into a modernized socialist power in a relatively short historical period."

The success of this hydrogen bomb test is the result of the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and scientific and technical personnel involved in the research and testing of nuclear weapons, who have held high the great red banner of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's call to "carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly." They are full of spirit and high morale, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production. During the research and testing process, they deeply studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and firmly defended the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They fully played the leading role of the working class, implemented the policy of combining scientific and technical personnel with workers and theory with practice, pooled their wisdom, relied on their own efforts, daringly conducted scientific experiments, overcame various difficulties, solved a series of new problems, and ensured the complete success of this new hydrogen bomb test.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission extend warm congratulations to the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, scientists, and all relevant personnel involved in the research and testing of nuclear weapons! We hope that everyone will remain humble and press on, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, holding high the great red banner of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and emphasizing proletarian politics. We must fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. We must further promote the revolutionization of thought, continuously enhance revolutionary spirit, scientific rigor, and organizational discipline, strive to accomplish the tasks of each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation proposed by Chairman Mao, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and make new and greater contributions to accelerating the development of our national defense science and technology and achieving the modernization of our national defense!

Currently, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist traitors are beset with contradictions, disintegrating, and facing internal and external difficulties, with nowhere to turn. To save their dying fate, the U.S. and Soviet revisionists are colluding with each other while also competing, rapidly expanding their military buildup, and attempting to re-divide the world. On the issue of nuclear weapons, they have concocted a so-called "non-proliferation treaty" and are plotting a new deal called "limiting and reducing strategic nuclear weapon systems" to maintain their broken nuclear monopoly and promote nuclear colonialism. However, their counter-revolutionary collusion can only educate the world's revolutionary peoples from the opposite side, promoting the great struggle of the revolutionary peoples of all countries against U.S.-led imperialism, Soviet revisionist traitors, and the reactionaries of all countries. China's success in this new hydrogen bomb test is another blow to the nuclear threats and blackmail policies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, greatly encouraging and supporting the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries.

The Chinese government once again reiterates that China's necessary and limited nuclear tests and development of nuclear weapons are solely for defense purposes, to break the nuclear monopoly, and ultimately to eliminate nuclear weapons. We once again solemnly declare that under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. Our words are always true. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will, as always, continue to work with the revolutionary peoples of the world and independent, peace-loving countries to strive together for the lofty goal of a complete ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　文化大革命的丰硕成果
    我国成功地进行了一次新的氢弹试验
    我们以十分喜悦的心情，热烈欢呼这次氢弹试验的成功，这是对将要召开的党的第九次全国代表大会的一项重大献礼，它标志着我国核武器的发展又有了新的飞跃。
    中共中央、中央文革、国务院、中央军委，向从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军指战员、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员，致以热烈的祝贺！希望大家戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，更高地举起马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为加速我国国防科学技术的发展和实现我国国防现代化，作出新的更大的贡献！
    中国这次新的氢弹试验成功，又一次打击了美帝、苏修的核威胁、核讹诈政策，对于英勇的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底，对于世界各国人民的革命斗争，是一个大的鼓舞和支持。
    新华社十二月二十八日讯　新闻公报
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的进军声中，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，一九六八年十二月二十七日，我国在西部地区上空，又爆炸了一颗氢弹，成功地进行了一次新的热核试验。
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果，是对将要召开的党的第九次全国代表大会的一项重大献礼。我们以十分喜悦的心情，热烈欢呼这次氢弹试验的成功，它标志着我国核武器的发展又有了新的飞跃。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。”
    这次氢弹试验的成功，是我国从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军和科学技术人员，高举马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决响应毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大号召，意气风发，斗志昂扬，狠抓革命，猛促生产的结果。在研制和试验过程中，他们深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，贯彻执行科学技术人员与工人相结合、理论与实际相结合的方针，群策群力，自力更生，大胆地进行科学实验，克服了各种困难，解决了一系列新的问题，保证了这次新的氢弹试验圆满成功。
    中国共产党中央委员会、中央文革、国务院、中央军委，向从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军指战员、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员，致以热烈的祝贺！希望大家戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，更高地举起马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到新的水平。要进一步促进思想革命化，不断加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，努力实现毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为加速我国国防科学技术的发展和实现我国国防现代化，作出新的更大的贡献！
    当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者，他们矛盾重重，分崩离析，内外交困，走投无路，日益陷于孤立。为了挽救他们垂死的命运，美帝、苏修正在互相勾结，又互相争夺，加紧扩大军备，妄图重新瓜分世界。在核武器问题上，他们炮制了一个所谓“防止核扩散条约”，并且正在阴谋策划所谓“限制和削减战略核武器系统”的新的交易，企图以此维持已被打破的核垄断地位，推行核殖民主义。但是，他们的反革命勾结，只能从反面教育世界革命人民，促进各国革命人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大斗争。中国这次新的氢弹试验成功，又一次打击了美帝、苏修的核威胁、核讹诈政策，对于英勇的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底，对于世界各国人民的革命斗争，是一个大的鼓舞和支持。
    中国政府再一次重申，中国进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，完全是为了防御，为了打破核垄断，其最终目的是为了消灭核武器。我们再一次郑重宣布，在任何时候、任何情况下，中国绝不会首先使用核武器。我们说的话，从来是算数的。中国人民和中国政府将一如既往，继续同全世界革命人民和维护独立、爱好和平的国家一道，共同努力，为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而奋斗。
