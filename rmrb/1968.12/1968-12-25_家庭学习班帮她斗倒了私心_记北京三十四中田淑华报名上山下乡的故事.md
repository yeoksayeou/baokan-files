When Chairman Mao's latest directive on "sending educated youth to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is very necessary. We must persuade city cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, or college to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants" was broadcast, Tian Shuhua was at home. After hearing it, she was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes. Standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, she said, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You have shown me the bright path to revolutionization. The family Mao Zedong Thought study class has helped me overcome the 'self' character. I am determined to respond to your great call and go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants." After saying this, she turned and ran to the school.

Tian Shuhua is a graduate of Beijing No. 34 Middle School. When it was time for job assignments after graduation, her classmates enthusiastically signed up to go to the countryside, to the most difficult places. Her classmates' revolutionary spirit deeply moved her, and she also wrote a resolution to go to the countryside. However, she then thought, "It will be so hard down there," and she tucked the resolution back into her pocket, keeping it there for several days without turning it in.

Tian Shuhua's father is a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing's No. 24 Store, and her mother is the director of the neighborhood committee. After learning about their daughter's thoughts, they felt that her unwillingness to go to the countryside was a sign of low awareness of the struggle between the two lines, which could be dangerous if allowed to develop. They decided, based on Vice Chairman Lin's teaching that "if you don't understand what class is, don't understand what exploitation is, then you don't understand revolution," to start with class education to raise their daughter's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

That day, they held a family Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the class, her father read a quote from Chairman Mao and recalled a segment of his bitter experiences. Tian Shuhua's father originally had three brothers. In the evil old society, two of her uncles were forced to wander around by the capitalists to collect debts and died miserably on the streets. Tian Shuhua's father, in order to survive, rented a car from the capitalists to pull a rickshaw, but it was smashed by the Japanese devils. The capitalists came to demand compensation for the car, and in the end, her father had to painfully sell one of his sons. As soon as her father finished speaking, her mother took over and said:

"Chairman Mao teaches us: 'How do you judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do you use to judge him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually does unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants.' Shuhua, are you willing to unite with the workers and peasants? This is a big issue of whether you are loyal to Chairman Mao or not! We fully support you going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. You must not fall for the trap of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi's 'study to become an official' theory!"

Tian Shuhua's brother is a platoon leader in the army and is currently working in a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in Beijing. That day, he also rushed to participate in the family study class. At this time, he interjected, "The big traitor Liu Shaoqi vigorously promotes the 'study to become an official' theory, attempting to make young people walk the path of revisionism and become his docile tools for restoring capitalism. Chairman Mao's latest directive is a thousand-year plan to prevent and combat revisionism, showing the greatest care for our young generation!" He then introduced some advanced examples of educated youth going to the countryside, inspiring Tian Shuhua to take practical actions to smash Liu Shaoqi's evil plots.

The family study class became a battlefield for criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The whole family took turns speaking, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's 'study to become an official' theory to shreds. The family's speeches aroused in Tian Shuhua an infinite love for Chairman Mao and a deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi. She angrily denounced the harm of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line on her, and fiercely struggled against the 'self' character in her mind. She angrily said, "Liu Shaoqi, this big villain, dares to plot against our young generation, trying to drag us back to the old society. That's just a pipe dream!"

In the family Mao Zedong Thought study class, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought raised Tian Shuhua's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. That very day, she went to the school to sign up. Now, she is actively preparing her luggage and will soon move to a new socialist countryside with her revolutionary classmates to settle down.

    家庭学习班帮她斗倒了私心
    ——记北京三十四中田淑华报名上山下乡的故事
    毛主席关于“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员”的最新指示广播的时候，田淑华正在家里。她听了以后，激动得热泪盈眶，站在毛主席像前说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家给我指出了革命化的光明大道，家庭毛泽东思想学习班帮助我斗倒了‘私’字，我决心响应您老人家的伟大号召，到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。”说完，她转身就向学校跑去了。
    田淑华是北京市三十四中毕业生。在毕业分配的时候，同学们纷纷报名下农村，到最艰苦的地方去。同学们的革命豪情壮志，深深地感动了她，于是她也写了一份上山下乡的决心书。可是，随后她又一想，下去多“苦”呀，便把“决心书”又掖进口袋里，装了好几天也没有上交。
    田淑华的父亲是北京市二十四商店革委会委员，母亲是街道居民委员会的主任。当他们了解到女儿的这种活思想以后，觉得女儿不愿下乡，是两条路线斗争觉悟不高的表现，发展下去是很危险的。他们根据林副主席“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命”的教导，决定从阶级教育入手，提高女儿的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    这天，他们全家在一起办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，父亲读一条毛主席语录，回忆自己一段苦难的经历。田淑华的父亲，原来弟兄三个，在万恶的旧社会里，两个哥哥被资本家要债逼得四处流浪，惨死在街头。田淑华的父亲为了活命，租了资本家的车子拉脚，可是又被日本鬼子给砸了。资本家又来逼迫赔车，父亲最后不得不忍痛卖掉了一个儿子。父亲的话音刚落，母亲就接过话来说：
  “毛主席教导我们：‘看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。’淑华愿意不愿意和工农结合，这可是对毛主席忠不忠的大问题啊！我们一百个支持你下到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。你可不能上了大叛徒刘少奇‘读书做官论’的当啊！”
    小田的哥哥是解放军排长，正在北京一个毛泽东思想宣传队里工作，这天也赶来参加了家庭学习班。这时他插话说：“大叛徒刘少奇极力鼓吹‘读书做官论’，妄图使青年走修正主义的道路，成为他复辟资本主义的驯服工具。毛主席的最新指示，是防修反修的千年大计，是对我们青年一代最大的关怀啊！”随后，他介绍了一些知识青年上山下乡的先进事迹，启发小田用实际行动粉碎刘少奇的罪恶阴谋。
    家庭学习班变成了批判刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的战场。全家你一言我一语，把刘少奇的“读书做官论”批得体无完肤。全家的发言，激起了小田对毛主席的无限热爱，对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，她愤怒地控诉了反革命修正主义教育路线对她的毒害，又狠斗了头脑里的
  “私”字。她气愤地说：“刘少奇这个大坏蛋，妄图在我们青年一代身上打算盘，拉着我们重新回到旧社会，那是白日做梦！”
    在家庭毛泽东思想学习班里，战无不胜的毛泽东思想使田淑华提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，当天她就到学校报了名。现在，她正积极准备行装，即将和革命同学一起奔向社会主义新农村安家落户。
