	Spanish students' anti-fascist struggle spreads rapidly across the country

	West German youth protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam

	Belgian students rise up against violence and suppression of student movements

	New China News Agency, December 7th: Madrid reports that the struggle of Spanish university students against the fascist tyranny and corrupt capitalist education system of the Franco regime has rapidly spread to higher education institutions across Spain.

	More than 20,000 students at the University of Madrid went on strike on the 6th. Four out of the seven major faculties in this university have been paralyzed by the strike. Due to the active participation of law students in the strike and their sit-in protests, the Spanish fascist authorities announced on the 6th that this faculty would be closed indefinitely.

	In Barcelona, despite the fascist authorities' order to close six faculties and a technical school at the University of Barcelona, the students' struggle is burning more intensely. Two more faculties at this university have joined the strike. On the 5th, students from the arts faculty burned down the university's gate to express their strong protest against the fascist authorities' suppression of students. When the reactionary dean rushed to suppress the students, the angry students poured gasoline on him and set him on fire, nearly burning the reactionary to death.

	In Valencia in eastern Spain, striking students held a mass rally on the evening of the 6th to protest against the fascist authorities' suppression of students. Students fought fiercely with the fascist police who came to suppress them. Striking students also occupied a faculty building.

	In addition, student strikes have also erupted in Compostela and Bilbao.

	New China News Agency, December 7th: Hamburg reports that over 1,000 young students from West Germany, Greece, and Iran held a demonstration in Hamburg on the evening of the 6th to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	The demonstrators carried red flags and marched towards the U.S. imperialist cultural invasion institution, the "American House." There, the demonstrators angrily tore down an American flag and threw stones at the building, smashing many windows. The demonstrators shouted, "Yankees, get out of Vietnam!"

	The West German authorities hastily dispatched police to suppress the demonstrators, who bravely fought back with stones against the police's suppression.

	Previously, the demonstrators also held a rally to protest against the fascist rule of the reactionary rulers of Greece and Iran over the people of Greece and Iran.

	New China News Agency, December 5th: Brussels reports that students at the University of Brussels occupied the school's administrative building on the 4th to strongly protest against the reactionary school authorities' summoning of police to suppress the student movement and engaged in fierce struggles with the police.

	The students of this university held a demonstration on the 3rd, which was dispersed by force by the police summoned by the school authorities. This brutal measure infuriated the students. On the 4th, about 200 students occupied the administrative building and rushed to the dean's office, engaging in a face-to-face struggle with him. This reactionary again summoned over 100 specially trained police wearing American-style helmets, who used batons, water cannons, and tear gas to suppress the students. The students, undaunted, fought back bravely with stones and homemade Molotov cocktails. The struggle lasted about five hours.

	On the same day, in Liège, 500 people held a demonstration to protest against the screening of an American film in this city that glorified U.S. aggression in Vietnam. The demonstrators tore up an American flag to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.
