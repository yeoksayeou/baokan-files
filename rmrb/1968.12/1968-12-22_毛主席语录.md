    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    It is necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We should persuade cadres and other people in the cities to send their children who have finished junior high, senior high, or college to the countryside. We should launch a movement to mobilize them to go. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them.

    \tThe poor and lower-middle peasants should welcome them.
