The great achievements of the Beijing Military Region in launching a mass frugality movement are inspiring. They reflect how the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is profoundly changing people's spiritual outlook, and this spiritual force will surely be transformed into abundant material results.

The great directive of our great leader Chairman Mao to "practice economy and make revolution" is an important component of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Economy is not only an economic issue but also a political one. It is a major matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the people, a major matter of preserving the cause of the proletarian revolution, a powerful weapon to resist the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, and an important guarantee for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Industry has increased production, agriculture has had a bumper harvest, a little waste doesn't matter!" This is the attitude of a bourgeois young master, which fundamentally contradicts Chairman Mao's policy of building the country through hard work and frugality. Economy is one of the basic principles of the socialist economy. Our industry and agriculture have indeed developed, and our country is richer and stronger than before. However, to truly build a powerful socialist country, we must always pay attention to economy. Waste of public property at any time is a serious crime.

"As long as the big issues are settled, a little waste is no big deal." Is this really the case? No. Frugality is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching. True proletarian revolutionaries will definitely regard economy as a concrete manifestation of loyalty to Chairman Mao and strive to be models of economy in making revolution, forever preserving the character of the working people. Much waste is bad; a little waste is also bad.

"When doing things that highlight politics, a little extravagance doesn't matter." Whether to be economical or wasteful is a struggle between the two thought lines of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Without a hardworking and frugal work style, it is impossible to carry out a firm and correct political line. To truly highlight proletarian politics, one must follow Chairman Mao's instructions on frugality in everything, spend less and do more, do things without spending money, and strive to do things better. Extravagance and showing off wealth are vulgar habits of the bourgeoisie, not the way to highlight proletarian politics.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of state power. Economy is a big deal, not a small one, because it concerns the question of where we are going after seizing power. Only by maintaining and carrying forward the proletarian spirit of frugality, hard work, and self-reliance can we temper revolutionary will, invigorate revolutionary spirit, prevent being hit by sugar-coated bullets, and ensure that the Party and the country will never change color. If we abandon the Party and the army's tradition of frugality, indulge in extravagance and waste, and follow the bourgeois way, our thoughts will be corrupted.

We must recognize the significance of economy from the height of state power and the height of the struggle between the two lines. We must take the implementation of economy and the opposition to waste as an important part of the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary economism, and eliminate its poison. We must carry out Chairman Mao's great thought of economy in making revolution in production, work, and life, and continuously revolutionize, tap potential, and innovate. We must seriously examine and rectify all phenomena of wasting state property and manpower, expose, strike, and criticize the destructive activities of capitalist forces on the economic front, and take increasing production and economy as practical actions to carry out the great directives of our great leader Chairman Mao.

All levels of Party committees and revolutionary committees must strengthen leadership, regard economy as a major issue, and constantly and repeatedly address it. We must break through conservative thinking, fully mobilize the masses, create public opinion, and make economy a matter of honor and waste a matter of shame, turning frugality into a widespread mass movement to accelerate the victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Let us welcome the brilliant year of 1969 with the vigorous proletarian revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, frugality, hard work, and struggle!

    坚持节约闹革命的伟大方针
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    北京部队开展群众性节约运动的巨大成绩，鼓舞人心。它反映了无产阶级文化大革命深刻地改变着人们的精神面貌，这种精神力量一定会化为丰硕的物质成果。
    伟大领袖毛主席要节约闹革命的伟大指示，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要组成部分。节约，不但是一个经济问题，而且是一个政治问题，是忠于毛主席忠于人民的大事，是保持无产阶级革命事业的大事，是抵制资产阶级糖衣炮弹袭击的有力武器，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证。
      “工业增产了，农业丰收了，浪费一点，小意思！”这种资产阶级大少爷作风，根本违背了毛主席的勤俭建国的方针。节约是社会主义经济的基本原则之一。我们的工农业是大发展了，我们的国家是比过去富强了，但是要真正建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家，还需要经常注意节约。对人民财产的任何浪费，在任何时候都是极大的犯罪。
    “大节好了就行，有点浪费是小事情。”真的是这样吗？不。勤俭节约，是毛主席一贯的教导。真正的无产阶级革命派，一定会把节约看作是忠于毛主席的具体表现，做节约闹革命的模范，永远保持劳动人民的本色。浪费大，不好；有点浪费，也不好。
      “办突出政治的事，讲点排场算不了什么问题。”节约还是浪费，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种思想作风的斗争。没有艰苦奋斗的工作作风，也就不能执行坚定正确的政治方向。真正突出无产阶级政治，就应该处处、事事贯彻毛主席勤俭节约的指示，少花钱，多办事，不花钱，也办事，而且力争把事情办得更好。讲排场，比阔气，是资产阶级的庸俗习气，绝不是突出无产阶级政治的做法。
    毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。节约是大事，不是小事，因为它是关系到夺权以后我们向何处去的问题。只有保持和发扬无产阶级的勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗、自力更生的作风，才能锻炼革命意志，振奋革命精神，防止被糖衣炮弹击中，保证党和国家永不变色。如果丢掉我党我军勤俭节约的传家宝，铺张浪费，搞资产阶级那一套，我们的思想就要受到腐蚀。
    我们一定要从政权的高度、从两条路线斗争的高度来认识节约的意义。要把厉行节约、反对浪费作为斗私批修的重要内容，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命经济主义，肃清它的流毒。要把毛主席要节约闹革命的伟大思想，贯彻到生产、工作、生活各个方面去，不断革命，狠挖潜力，大搞革新。要认真地检查和纠正一切浪费国家财产、浪费人力物力的不良现象，揭露、打击和批判资本主义势力在经济战线上的破坏活动，把增产节约作为执行伟大领袖毛主席伟大指示的实际行动。
    各级党委和革命委员会要加强领导，把节约作为一件大事来抓，经常抓，反复抓。要打破保守思想，充分发动群众，造成舆论，做到人人都以节约为荣，浪费为耻，使勤俭节约成为广泛的群众运动，以加速社会主义革命和社会主义建设的胜利发展。让我们以自力更生、勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗的朝气勃勃的无产阶级革命精神，来迎接光辉的一九六九年的来临吧！
