Nanning military and civilians hold grand rally to warmly celebrate the 8th anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

New China News Agency, Nanning, December 24th - Over a thousand revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Nanning held a grand rally today to warmly celebrate the 8th anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Lai Songshan, a member of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, specially came to Nanning to participate in the celebration. Li Guangdian, Consul of the Consulate General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Nanning, and other Vietnamese comrades in Nanning were also invited to attend the meeting.

Han Shifu, Chairman of the Nanning Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He praised the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam for leading the people of South Vietnam in a people's war for eight years, achieving brilliant victories in the anti-American national salvation war. He pointed out that recently, the U.S. imperialists, who are in serious internal and external difficulties, have been desperately engaging in military adventurism and political deception, struggling to the end. In the evil activities of the U.S., the Soviet revisionist clique plays the role of the number one accomplice. This further proves that the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are the most vicious enemies of the Vietnamese people and all the people of the world. Han Shifu said, we believe that the heroic Vietnamese people, who have been tempered by revolutionary wars, will surely achieve the final victory in the anti-American national salvation war as long as they persist in the people's war. Han Shifu expressed that the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, together with the people of the whole country, will forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "The 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." We resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

Lai Songshan, a member of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, said in his speech that the past eight years have been eight years of heroic struggle and brilliant victories for the military and people of South Vietnam. The failure of U.S. imperialism is already obvious, but it still does not give up its ambition to invade South Vietnam. We are determined to implement the teachings of Chairman Ho Chi Minh: "As long as there is an invader on our land, we will continue to fight and drive them all out."

Lai Songshan said, the fraternal Chinese people, following the instructions of Chairman Mao, have been actively and continuously assisting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle. The respectful Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, in their telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on December 19th, reaffirmed: "The 700 million Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end." This is a great encouragement to the people of South Vietnam. He said, the people of South Vietnam sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater victories in the cause of building socialism, and wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, complete victory.

At the celebration meeting, the revolutionary masses repeatedly shouted slogans: "Resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!"

Attending the meeting were responsible comrades from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the Nanning Revolutionary Committee, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanning, including An Pingsheng, Liao Weixiong, Wu Hua, Fan Dibo, and Xiao Han, as well as representatives of Nanning revolutionary mass organizations.

    坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底
    南宁军民隆重集会热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年
    新华社南宁二十四日电　南宁革命群众和中国人民解放军指战员一千多人，今天隆重集会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团员黎松山专程到南宁参加庆祝大会。越南民主共和国驻南宁总领事馆领事黎光奠，以及在南宁的越南同志也应邀参加了大会。
    南宁市革命委员会主任韩世福在大会上讲话，他赞扬越南南方民族解放阵线八年来领导越南南方军民，坚持人民战争，在抗美救国战争中取得了辉煌胜利。他指出，最近，陷入严重内外交困的美帝国主义，大肆玩弄军事冒险和政治欺骗的反革命两手，进行垂死挣扎。在美帝的罪恶活动中，苏修叛徒集团扮演了头号帮凶的角色。这更进一步证明美帝和苏修是越南人民和全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。韩世福说，我们相信，久经革命战争考验的英雄的越南人民，只要坚持人民战争，就一定能够取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。韩世福表示，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼、用毛泽东思想武装起来的广西各族革命人民，和全国人民一样，永远遵循伟大领袖毛主席“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方”的教导，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团员黎松山在讲话中说，过去的八年，是越南南方军民进行英勇战斗并取得辉煌胜利的八年。美帝国主义的失败已很明显，但它仍不肯放弃侵略越南南方的野心。我们决心实现胡志明主席的教导：“只要在我国土地上还有一个侵略者，我们就要继续战斗，把它全部赶出去。”
    黎松山说，兄弟的中国人民遵照毛主席的指示，不断地积极地援助越南人民的抗美救国斗争。敬爱的毛主席和林副主席、周总理，于十二月十九日给阮友寿主席的贺电中重申：“七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底”，这是对越南南方人民的巨大鼓舞。他说，越南南方人民衷心祝愿兄弟的中国人民在建设社会主义的事业中取得更大的胜利，祝毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利。
    在庆祝大会上，革命群众不断高呼口号：“坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”
    出席大会的，有广西壮族自治区革命委员会、南宁市革命委员会和中国人民解放军驻南宁部队负责人安平生、廖炜雄、吴华、范迪波、肖寒，以及南宁革命群众组织的代表。
