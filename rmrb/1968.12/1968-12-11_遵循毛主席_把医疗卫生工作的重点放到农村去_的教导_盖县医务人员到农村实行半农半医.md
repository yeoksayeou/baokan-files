Following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "focus medical and health work on rural areas," since 1966, 274 medical personnel in Gaixian County, Liaoning Province, have gone to people's communes in rural areas to implement the half-farming and half-medicine system. They have received re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas, accelerated their ideological transformation, and promoted the development of rural medical and health work.

Due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents, medical institutions in Gaixian County were previously all located in cities and towns far from rural areas, resulting in a shortage of doctors and medicines in rural areas. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary medical personnel in Gaixian County studied Chairman Mao's great instruction to "focus medical and health work on rural areas," raised their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line of China's Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi. They all applied to go to rural areas. Since 1966, doctors who went to rural areas to implement the half-farming and half-medicine system are both doctors and commune members. They engage in preventive and curative healthcare work and participate in the collective production labor of production brigades. They do not receive state salaries but earn work points and participate in the distribution of production brigades. This approach was warmly welcomed by poor and lower-middle peasants. The practice over the past two years has proven that sending medical personnel to rural areas to implement the half-farming and half-medicine system has the following advantages:

1. Poor and lower-middle peasants firmly grasp the power of rural medical and health work. In the past, the location of health stations, the assignment and use of medical personnel, and the establishment of medical and health systems were all managed vertically by the old health department. The power of medical and health work was controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois "authorities." Poor and lower-middle peasants had no say in the matter. After a large number of doctors went to production brigades to implement the half-farming and half-medicine system, they broke the bourgeois medical and health management system. Health stations were established and managed according to the wishes of poor and lower-middle peasants. Issues such as the assignment and use of doctors, doctor benefits, financial expenditures, the establishment of medical and health systems, and medical care for revolutionary martyrs' families, five-guarantee households, and other major issues were discussed and decided by the poor and lower-middle peasants' medical and health management committees. In the past, due to the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line, there were no health stations in 450 production brigades across the county's communes. Now, with a batch of medical personnel going to rural areas, many brigades have established health stations, greatly convenience the masses.

2. Medical personnel can better receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. After going to production brigades, medical personnel study, criticize revisionism, and engage in labor, eat, and live with poor and lower-middle peasants. They learn the firm proletarian stand and hardworking, simple, and noble qualities of poor and lower-middle peasants, and their thoughts and feelings undergo constant changes. They have put down the airs of intellectuals and no longer feel like "doctors," but rather ordinary commune members. Some medical personnel often stoke the kang (heated brick bed) and fetch water for revolutionary martyrs' families and five-guarantee households, diligently serving as servants of poor and lower-middle peasants.

3. Doctors have become "jack-of-all-trades," improving their skills to serve the people. In the past, in hospitals, "Western doctors did not concern themselves with traditional Chinese medicine, and doctors did not do nursing work." Internal medicine doctors did not treat external diseases, and the division of labor was too fine. After going to rural areas, poor and lower-middle peasants required them to follow Chairman Mao's instruction to serve the people wholeheartedly. They had to treat all kinds of diseases, enriching their medical knowledge and improving their skills in practice.

4. A large number of non-full-time health workers have been trained for production brigades, popularizing health knowledge, and improving rural health conditions.

    遵循毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导
    盖县医务人员到农村实行半农半医
    他们既是医生又是社员，既开展防病治病工作，又参加集体生产劳动，加速了思想革命化，促进了农村医疗卫生事业的发展，极大地方便了广大贫下中农
    新华社沈阳九日电　遵照伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导，辽宁省盖县有二百七十四名医务人员从一九六六年开始，到农村人民公社生产队实行半农半医。他们在农村接受贫下中农再教育，加速了思想革命化，同时促进了农村医疗卫生事业的发展。
    由于叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，过去盖县的医院都设在远离农村的城市和集镇，造成农村缺医少药。在无产阶级文化大革命中，盖县的广大革命医务工作者学习了毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大教导，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，他们狠批中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，纷纷申请到农村去。一九六六年到农村去实行半农半医的医生，他们既是医生又是社员，既开展防病治病工作，又参加生产队的集体生产劳动。他们不拿国家工资，记工分参加生产队的分配。这样做，受到了贫下中农的热烈欢迎。两年来的实践证明，医务人员下放到农村实行半农半医有以下几点好处：
    一、广大贫下中农牢牢地掌握了农村医疗卫生大权。过去，卫生所的布点，医务人员调动使用和医疗卫生制度的建立，都由旧卫生科垂直管理，医疗卫生大权被一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”所把持，广大贫下中农根本无权过问。大批医生下到生产队实行半农半医以后，打破了资产阶级的医疗卫生管理体制，卫生所完全按照贫下中农的意愿来创办和管理。对医生调动使用、医生待遇、财务开支、医疗卫生制度的建立、烈军属、五保户就医照顾等重大问题，都由贫下中农医疗卫生管理委员会讨论决定。过去，由于反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的控制，全县各公社四百五十个生产大队都没有卫生所。由于一批医务人员到了农村，现在很多大队办了卫生所，极大地方便了群众。
    二、医务人员可以更好地接受贫下中农的再教育。医务人员下到生产队后，和贫下中农同学习、同斗私批修、同劳动、同吃、同住，学习贫下中农坚定的无产阶级立场和勤劳朴素的高贵品质，思想感情不断发生变化。他们放下了知识分子的架子，不再感觉自己是“大夫”了，而是一个普通社员。有的医务人员，经常给烈军属、五保户烧炕、担水，勤勤恳恳地做贫下中农的勤务员。
    三、培养了医生“多面手”，提高了医生为人民服务的本领。过去在医院里是“西医不问中医事，大夫不做护士活”，内科医生不治外科的病，分工过细。医生到了农村以后，贫下中农要求他们按照毛主席的教导全心全意为人民服务，他们什么病都要经手治疗，在实践中，丰富了自己的医疗知识，提高了本领。
    四、为生产队培养了大批不脱产的卫生员，普及了卫生知识，改善了农村卫生条件。
