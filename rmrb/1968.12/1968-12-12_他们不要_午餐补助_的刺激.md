Inspired by the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyin Brigade in Hengbei Commune, Enping County, Guangdong Province, have launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism. This is the story of how the militiamen of Lianzhi Production Team fiercely criticized "material incentives."

Autumn harvest is almost over, and the only fields left unharvested in Lianzhi Production Team are the seven or eight mu of distant fields in Caotang. Considering that these fields are more than ten li away from the village, Team Leader Wen Ziming decided to speed up the work and complete the harvesting in one day. Following the old ways, he prepared seventy jin of rice, bought ten jin of pork, and planned to catch several dozen jin of fish as a lunch subsidy for those going to Caotang to cut the crops.

That evening, after everyone studied the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session, the team leader shared his plan. A debate then began. Militiaman Liu Songyuan stood up and loudly declared, "The communiqué calls on us to continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism. Providing a lunch subsidy is a remnant of Liu Shaoqi's ghost. To speed up the harvesting, we must emphasize proletarian politics and absolutely not resort to 'material incentives' again." Before he finished speaking, militiaman Wen Qianming started firing questions like a machine gun: "Liu Shaoqi advocates 'material incentives,' which are poisonous drugs that corrupt revolutionary masses and opium that sedates the masses. If we take it, we will become revisionists." He then recounted his personal experiences, vehemently denouncing the harm caused by "material incentives." He angrily said, "In the past, in order to earn more work points and more rewards, I worked carelessly and paid no attention to quality. Poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'material incentives,' we could not distinguish between socialism and capitalism and would follow him down the capitalist path. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Political work is the lifeline of all economic work.' Providing a lunch subsidy is against Chairman Mao's teachings on political leadership and falls for the trap of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi's 'material incentives'..."

The militiamen's piercing criticism touched everyone's soul. Those who originally thought that going to Caotang to cut crops was far and hard, and that providing some lunch subsidy was only natural, also realized that they had been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi. They all stood up to fiercely criticize the revisionist fallacies of "material incentives." The team leader was also deeply moved, feeling both angry and ashamed, realizing that he had done something disloyal to Chairman Mao. He said, "The plenary session has decided to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, but the poison of Liu Shaoqi still lingers in my mind and I unconsciously promoted his 'material incentives' black goods. In the future, I will definitely learn from today's lesson, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi, and lead everyone to always follow the path of emphasizing politics."

To smash the black goods of "material incentives" with practical actions and speed up the autumn work, the militiamen proudly declared, "Tomorrow's task of going to Caotang to cut crops will be entirely taken over by us. Other team members will stay home to do winter sowing, and we will not accept any subsidy from the team." The next morning, all sixteen militiamen of the team, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and red flags, marched towards Caotang more than ten li away, full of spirit. After eight hours of hard work, they completed a task that would have taken the entire team more than ten hours to finish in the past. In the evening, everyone returned triumphantly, carrying more than ten loads of golden rice, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations.

### 他们不要“午餐补助”的刺激

    他们不要“午餐补助”的刺激
    在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，广东省恩平县横陂公社白银大队的贫下中农进一步掀起了革命大批判高潮。这里说的是莲枝里生产队民兵狠批“物质刺激”的故事。
    秋收已快结束，莲枝里生产队只剩下草塘的七、八亩边远田没有收割。生产队长温子明考虑到这些田离村十多里路，为了加快速度一天把它收割完，便照过去的老皇历办事，加工了七十斤大米，买了十斤猪肉，还准备捞几十斤鱼，作为去草塘割禾的午餐补助。
    这天晚上，大家学习完十二中全会公报以后，队长就把自己的打算说了出来，于是一场辩论开始了。民兵刘松源站起来高声说道：“公报号召我们继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义的流毒。搞午餐补助，就是刘少奇的阴魂没散。要割禾速度快，必须突出无产阶级政治，决不能再搞‘物质刺激’那一套了。”没等他说完，民兵温欠明便连珠炮似地开了火：“刘少奇鼓吹‘物质刺激’，是腐蚀革命群众的毒剂，麻醉群众的迷魂汤，我们吃了它就会变修。”接着，他以亲身的经历，痛斥了“物质刺激”对自己的毒害。他愤怒地说：“过去，我为了多拿工分，多得奖励，干活马马虎虎，不顾质量；中了刘少奇‘物质刺激’的毒，我们就分不清社会主义和资本主义，就会跟着他往资本主义邪路上走。毛主席教导我们：‘政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。’搞午餐补助，就是违背毛主席关于政治挂帅的教导，上了大叛徒刘少奇‘物质刺激’的当……。”
    民兵们一针见血的批判，触及了大家的灵魂，原来认为去草塘割禾路远、活重，搞点午餐补助是天经地义的少数社员，也觉悟到自己是中了刘少奇的毒害，纷纷起来狠批“物质刺激”的修正主义谬论。队长更是心潮翻滚，又怒又恨，觉得自己做了对毛主席不忠的事。他说：“全会公报已经决定把刘少奇永远开除出党，但是刘少奇的流毒在我的思想上还没有彻底肃清，甚至还在不自觉地替他推销‘物质刺激’的黑货。今后，我一定吸取今天的教训，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，彻底肃清刘少奇的流毒，带领大家永远走突出政治的道路。”
    为了用实际行动砸烂“物质刺激”的黑货，加快“三秋”速度，民兵们豪迈地提出：“明天到草塘割禾的任务由我们全部包下，其他社员留家搞冬种，并且不要队里一丝一毫的补助。”第二天一早，全队十六个民兵迎着东方的朝阳，高举着毛主席画像和红旗，意气风发地奔向十多里远的草塘。八个小时的奋战，他们完成了过去全队社员要干十多个小时才能完成的任务。傍晚，大家挑着十多担金黄的稻谷，高唱毛主席语录歌凯旋而归。
