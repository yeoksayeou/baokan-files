The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Jiangxi Medical College is resolutely executing the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, leading the entire faculty and student body to continue deepening the revolutionary criticism. During the criticism, the propaganda team members act both as commanders and as combatants, continually identifying problems and guiding the situation, making the revolutionary criticism deeper and deeper, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the revolutionary teachers and students, and driving the struggle, criticism, and reform.

After the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum was issued, the worker propaganda team went deep into the classrooms and joined the revolutionary teachers and students, with deep proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, quickly launching a high tide of thoroughly exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in this unit. However, when the worker propaganda team went deep into the class of 1969 and had heart-to-heart talks with the revolutionary teachers and students, they discovered that some students had the erroneous thought of "criticism has reached its peak." The worker propaganda team believed that the root of this thought was the poison of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." With the thought that revolutionary criticism has reached its peak, one cannot continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism, and one cannot actively launch an attack on the class enemy. Therefore, the worker propaganda team went deep into each classroom, and together with everyone, studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "never forgetting class struggle," combined with the reality of class struggle in this unit, used the iron-clad evidence of a handful of class enemies plotting to restore capitalism, spoke extensively about the class oppression and exploitation of the old society, and severely denounced the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." The worker propaganda team also led the revolutionary teachers and students to the countryside to dig wild vegetables, eat bitter meals together, and hold remembrance meetings. Many old workers took the stage to denounce their tragic experiences in the old society. One old worker took the lead in angrily denouncing how the evil old society took the lives of three members of his family, how his ancestors had to beg for food and work like cattle for three generations. He said with great emotion: "The landlords, capitalists, and the traitor Liu Shaoqi wanted me to die, but it was Chairman Mao who saved me. Without Chairman Mao, I would have nothing. Today, Liu Shaoqi is releasing the poison gas of 'the theory of the extinction of class struggle,' trying to drag us back to the old path, making us suffer again. This is absolutely impossible, a million times impossible!" Through the worker propaganda team's class education of remembrance and sweetness, the revolutionary teachers and students realized that in the midst of celebrating victory, class struggle has not ended but has become more acute and complex. The revolutionary teachers and students said: "The class enemy has a head of granite, and will never willingly perish. They are like the green onions under the eaves, with dry skin and withered roots but a living heart. If we relax the criticism, they will come back." The worker propaganda team and the revolutionary teachers and students together severely criticized the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," changing the "relax" character to an "attack" character.

In this battle, the worker propaganda team, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the working class should also continually raise its political consciousness in struggle," took the lead in struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, deeply touching the soul, leading the revolutionary teachers and students into the forefront of the battle. The revolutionary teachers and students said: "The propaganda team leads the way, the revolutionary criticism is more and more vigorous, more and more energetic, and more and more sweet."

The worker propaganda team, on the front line of the revolutionary criticism, continually identified problems, summarized experiences, set up models, and led by example, effectively promoting the deepening of the revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary criticism in Class 3 of the 1970 level was done relatively well, achieving: class self-battle, group self-battle, individual self-battle, individual oral denunciation and written denunciation, everyone taking up arms; they also went deep into the countryside, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants there, studied the communiqué of the Eighth Central Committee's Twelfth Plenum, and deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism, effectively promoting the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and reform. The worker propaganda team members went deep into this class, helping them further summarize the experience of carrying out the revolutionary criticism, and held a school-wide revolutionary criticism on-site meeting, introducing the experience of Class 3, making the revolutionary criticism appear in a new situation.

The worker propaganda team also went deep into the backward units, timely identifying and solving problems, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, making everyone actively participate in the revolutionary criticism. In the West Wing of the Third Floor of the First Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi Medical College, some medical staff prioritized their profession and did not actively participate in the criticism. Therefore, the criticism in this ward did not deepen. The worker propaganda team members believed that the revolutionary criticism in the school had developed in depth and could not leave any blind spots. Where there are the most problems, the worker propaganda team should go there to help solve them. Therefore, the worker propaganda team member Xiong Changsheng, with a bag on his back, came to the ward and, together with the medical staff and patients, studied the communiqué and Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." This made everyone further understand the relationship between politics and profession, and recognize the great significance of doing a good job in the revolutionary criticism. They said: "No matter how busy we are, if we do not grasp the revolutionary criticism, we are busy in vain. Only by actively participating in the revolutionary criticism and continually raising our awareness of the two-line struggle can we do a good job in medical work." On the basis of raising awareness, the medical staff and patients, together with the specific situation of this unit, thoroughly criticized the revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the other handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly settling their accounts for the heinous crimes they committed in the medical and health sector. At the same time, they combined criticism of revisionism with self-criticism, making the revolutionary criticism continually deepen, leaping to become an advanced unit in various wards of the affiliated hospital of the medical college.

    驻江西医学院工人宣传队率领革命师生认真落实公报提出的斗批改任务
    在革命大批判中不断总结新经验
    革命师生斗志昂扬越批越有劲头
    本报讯　驻江西医学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队，坚决执行十二中全会公报提出的战斗任务，领导全校师生继续深入开展革命大批判。在大批判中，宣传队同志既当指挥员，又当战斗员，不断发现问题，因势利导，使革命大批判步步深入，大大促进了广大革命师生的思想革命化，推动了斗、批、改。
    十二中全会公报发表后，工人宣传队深入班级和广大革命师生一道，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚的无产阶级感情，迅速掀起了彻底清算大叛徒刘少奇及其在本单位代理人的反革命罪行的高潮。但当工人宣传队深入到六九级和革命师生谈心时，发现有的同学存有“大批判到顶”的活思想。工人宣传队认为，这种思想的根子是叛徒刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”的流毒。有了革命大批判到顶的思想，就不能继续深入开展革命大批判，就不能主动地向阶级敌人发动进攻。于是，工人宣传队深入到各班级，和大家一起学习了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，结合本单位阶级斗争的现实，用一小撮阶级敌人进行复辟资本主义阴谋活动的铁的罪证，大讲大忆旧社会的阶级压迫和剥削苦，痛斥大叛徒刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。工人宣传队还带领革命师生到野外挖野菜，一起吃忆苦饭，召开忆苦思甜大会。许多老工人纷纷上台控诉在旧社会的悲惨遭遇。有一个老工人带头愤怒控诉了万恶的旧社会夺去了他一家三口人的生命，祖辈三代逃荒要饭，当牛做马的悲惨生活。他无比激动地说：“地主、资本家和刘少奇这个大坏蛋要我死，是毛主席他老人家救了我。没有毛主席就没有我的一切。今天刘少奇放出‘阶级斗争熄灭论’的毒气弹，妄想把我们拉回到老路上去，让我们吃二遍苦，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！”通过工人宣传队忆苦思甜的阶级教育，广大革命师生认识到，在欢庆胜利的锣鼓声中，阶级斗争并没有结束，而是更尖锐，更复杂了。广大革命师生说：“阶级敌人长着一副花冈岩头脑，永远也不会甘心灭亡的。他们好比屋檐下的大葱，皮干根枯心不死。如果我们放松了大批判，他们就会卷土重来。”工人宣传队和广大革命师生一起，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，把“松”字换成“攻”字。
    在这场战斗中，工人宣传队遵照毛主席
  “工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，带头斗私批修，狠触灵魂，率领革命师生冲锋陷阵。革命师生说：“宣传队带头，大批判越批越有批头，越批越有劲头，越批越尝到甜头。”
      工人宣传队在革命大批判的火线上，不断发现问题，总结经验，树立样板，以点带面，有力地促进了革命大批判的深入开展。七○级三班革命大批判搞得比较好，做到了：班自为战，组自为战，人自为战，人人口诛笔伐，个个挥戈上阵；他们还深入到农村，同那里的贫下中农一起，学习党的八届十二中全会公报，深入开展革命大批判，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。工人宣传队的同志深入到这个班，帮助他们进一步总结了开展革命大批判的经验，并召开了全校革命大批判现场会，介绍了三班的经验，使革命大批判又出现了新局面。
    工人宣传队还深入落后单位，及时发现问题，解决问题，充分调动群众积极性，使每个人都积极参加革命大批判。江西医学院第一附属医院西三楼病区部分医务人员业务挂帅，不积极参加大批判。因此，这个病区的大批判深入不下去。工人宣传队的同志认为，学校里的革命大批判向纵深发展了，不能留下死角，那里问题最多，工人宣传队就应该到那里去帮助解决。于是，工人宣传队成员熊长生同志就背着背包来到病区，和医务人员、病员一起学习公报，一起学习毛主席的伟大教导：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”使大家进一步认清了政治同业务的关系，认识到搞好革命大批判的伟大意义。他们说：“千忙万忙不抓革命大批判就是瞎忙。只有积极参加革命大批判，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，才能把医务工作做好。”在提高认识的基础上，医务人员和病员一起结合本单位的具体情况，彻底批判刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，彻底清算他们在医疗卫生部门所犯下的滔天罪行。同时，把批修和斗私结合起来，革命大批判不断向纵深发展，一跃成为医学院附属医院各病区的先进单位。
