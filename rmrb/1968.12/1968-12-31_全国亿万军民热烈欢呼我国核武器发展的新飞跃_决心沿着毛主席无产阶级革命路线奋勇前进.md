In the midst of nationwide jubilation over the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test, the hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians across the country, with profound proletarian sentiments of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, warmly celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically praise the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians have expressed their determination to, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, raise even higher the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, deeply carry out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, further enhance the consciousness of implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strive to accomplish the tasks of each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The great news of the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test has brought immense joy and excitement to the military and civilians nationwide. Over the past few days, from the capital to the remotest mountain areas, from cities to rural villages, from the thousand-mile border defenses to the ten-thousand-mile seas, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary people have held grand celebrations. People carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao and held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The people in various places have determined to implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war," and to create even more outstanding achievements on all fronts, using practical actions to welcome the upcoming Ninth National Congress of the Party and to welcome an even greater 1969.

Vice Chairman Lin has instructed us: "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, an invincible spiritual atomic bomb." As various places celebrate the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test, they review the historical process of the great leader Chairman Mao leading the Chinese revolution from victory to victory over the past few decades, especially the great victories achieved one after another during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have an even deeper understanding: the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline. Song Xueyi, one of the Five Heroes of Mount Langya and the head of the Revolutionary Committee and militia platoon leader of Beikong Brigade in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, said, "Thousands of victories, tens of thousands of victories, all are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can hack through thorns and brambles and climb the peaks of world science; with Mao Zedong Thought, we can create all miracles of the world through self-reliance; with Mao Zedong Thought, we can defeat all class enemies and ensure that the socialist iron fortress remains red for generations." The soldiers of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region said, "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Analyzing everything with Mao Zedong Thought clarifies right and wrong; guiding everything with Mao Zedong Thought clarifies the direction; promoting everything with Mao Zedong Thought speeds up progress; commanding everything with Mao Zedong Thought ensures invincibility." A poor peasant representative participating in the second expanded meeting of the Revolutionary Committee of Helan County in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region said, "The success of China's new hydrogen bomb test once again proves that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline and happiness line of the revolutionary people, the red line for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Guting Commune in Shanghang County, Fujian Province, an old revolutionary base area, excitedly said, "Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great victories. The decades of struggle have made us increasingly deeply realize that following the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is victory!"

At various celebrations and symposiums held across the country, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary people used the numerous new achievements they created under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. The workers building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge said, "During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we bridge workers smashed Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, carried forward Chairman Mao's teachings of 'self-reliance and hard struggle,' and completed the bridge construction ahead of schedule, creating a miracle in the history of world bridge building." The success of China's new hydrogen bomb test and the successful completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge once again powerfully proved: advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is invincible. National industrial labor model and member of the Revolutionary Committee of Wuhan Jianghan Vehicle Factory, Fan Zhongzhi, deeply felt that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, walking the path of self-reliance can achieve: what foreigners have, we must have; what foreigners do not have, we must also have. The workers and technicians of the Nanning Machinery Factory in Guangxi, who recently successfully developed a new type of diesel engine, said, "The success of China's new hydrogen bomb test once again declared the bankruptcy of Liu Shaoqi's 'crawling philosophy.' As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and guide our actions with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, dare to practice, and continuously summarize experience, we can create all miracles of the world." With the help of the stationed PLA, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Motorcycle Factory seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies of "expert management," "technology first," and "material incentives," and greatly promoted technological innovation and production development. The PLA comrades and the broad masses of workers talked about these achievements with great excitement, saying, "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, when grasped by the masses, will produce tremendous material force." The workers, the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, and the revolutionary scientific workers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences pointed out that the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test is a powerful criticism of Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "slave philosophy." We must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of various countries in the world, crawling behind others step by step. We must break conventions and adopt advanced technology as much as possible to build our country into a modernized socialist power in a not too long historical period." We must walk our own path and climb the peaks of world science and technology.

The broad masses of industrial workers and revolutionary people across the country said with great pride when celebrating the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test: this new thermonuclear test success fully proves that the working class must lead everything and can indeed lead everything. The broad revolutionary workers expressed their determination to, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "fully bringing into play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly carry out each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The great victory of the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test has greatly inspired the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary people across the country. They are filled with the joy of victory and revolutionary enthusiasm, determined to raise even higher the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously highlight proletarian politics, and raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. They are determined to, in accordance with the great teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on "seriously carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation," redouble their efforts, continuously consolidate and develop revolutionary committees, carry out revolutionary criticism more extensively and deeply, seriously do the work of cleaning up class ranks, seriously do the work of rectifying and building the Party, carry out educational reform, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, grasp revolution, promote production, and achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army are determined to, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great instructions, strengthen preparedness for war, consolidate national defense, be ready at any time to annihilate any invading enemy, and achieve new merits in the great struggle to defend the motherland, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    我国新的氢弹试验成功的特大喜讯传来，全国军民欢欣鼓舞，祖国大地处处欢腾。这两天，从首都到最边远的山区，从城市到农村，从千里边防到万里海疆，广大工农兵和革命群众连续举行了规模盛大的庆祝活动。人们抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍遍地高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”各地军民决心贯彻毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，在各条战线上创造出更加出色的成就，用实际行动迎接将要召开的党的第九次全国代表大会，迎接更加伟大的一九六九年。
    林彪副主席指示我们：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”各地军民在热烈欢呼我国这次新的氢弹试验成功的时候，回顾伟大领袖毛主席几十年来领导中国革命从胜利走向胜利的历史进程，特别是无产阶级文化大革命中取得的一个又一个伟大胜利，更加深刻地体会到：战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们的生命线。狼牙山五壮士之一、河南沁阳县北孔大队革委会主任兼民兵连长宋学义说，千胜利，万胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。有了毛泽东思想，我们就能披荆斩棘，攀登世界科学的高峰；有了毛泽东思想，我们就能自力更生地创造出一切人间奇迹；有了毛泽东思想，我们就能战胜一切阶级敌人，确保社会主义铁打江山万代红。沈阳部队某部指战员说，大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。用毛泽东思想分析一切，是非就清；用毛泽东思想指导一切，方向就明；用毛泽东思想推动一切，前进就快；用毛泽东思想统帅一切，就无往而不胜。正在参加宁夏回族自治区贺兰县革委会第二次扩大会议的贫农代表说，我国新的氢弹试验成功，再一次证明毛主席的革命路线是我们革命人民的生命线、幸福线，是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义的红线。革命老根据地福建上杭县古田公社的贫下中农激动地说，在毛主席的革命路线指引下，我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得了伟大的胜利。几十年的战斗历程使我们越来越深刻地体会到，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟毛主席的革命路线，就是胜利！

    各地广大产业工人和革命群众在欢呼我国新的氢弹试验成功的时候，无比自豪地说，这次新的热核试验成功，充分证明了工人阶级必须领导一切，也完全能够领导一切。广大革命工人表示：一定要遵照毛主席的“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的伟大教导，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，认真落实毛主席的每一个最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我国新的氢弹试验成功这一伟大胜利，极大地鼓舞着全国各地工农兵和广大革命群众。他们满怀胜利的喜悦和革命的豪情，决心更高地举起马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到新水平。他们决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大教导，加倍努力，不断巩固和发展革命委员会，更加广泛深入地开展革命大批判，认真做好清理阶级队伍工作，认真做好整党建党工作，搞好教育革命，精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度，抓革命，促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。人民解放军广大指战员决心遵照毛主席的伟大指示，加强战备，巩固国防，随时准备歼灭敢于来犯的敌人，在保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级专政、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争中再立新功。
