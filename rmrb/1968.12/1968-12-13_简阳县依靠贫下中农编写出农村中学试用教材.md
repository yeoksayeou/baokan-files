Following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "textbooks must be thoroughly reformed," Jianyang County relies on poor and lower-middle peasants to write trial textbooks for rural middle schools. The new textbooks emphasize proletarian politics, closely link with the actual conditions of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation in rural areas, and are concise and precise. Both the poor and lower-middle peasants and the students welcome them.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "textbooks must be thoroughly reformed." Using Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution as a weapon, they have started from the needs of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation in rural areas. In just over three months, they have compiled a set of trial textbooks for the first year of rural primary schools with attached junior middle school classes. Their methods of compiling textbooks provide some initial experience for carrying out textbook reforms.

The educational revolution in rural areas of Jianyang County began this year. Various communes have set up primary schools with attached junior middle school classes, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have taken control of the educational power, recommending many outstanding young people to enroll in school. Both the poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary teachers and students are very pleased. However, what should the students in the junior middle school classes learn? At that time, apart from using the works of Chairman Mao as the main course, there were no suitable new textbooks for other subjects. Some schools followed the old junior middle school system, setting up courses in physics, chemistry, algebra, geometry, botany, zoology, and other subjects, while more schools simply had a few teachers sit in a room and condense and delete the old textbooks, claiming it as a reform. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very dissatisfied with this situation, saying, "What's the difference between this and the old middle school?"

This problem attracted the attention of the Jianyang County Revolutionary Committee. They believed that the old textbooks were full of the black goods of the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and revisionism. To cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, they could not use old textbooks and must thoroughly reform the textbooks. For this reason, starting in July, the county revolutionary committee selected more than 20 revolutionary middle and primary school teachers and students from all over the county to form a textbook compilation group. They instructed them to follow Chairman Mao's instruction that "textbooks must be thoroughly reformed," rely on the masses, and compile a set of textbooks that shine with the thoughts of Mao Zedong.

In just over three months, the members of the compilation group visited 17 communes and dozens of production teams, participated in nearly 100 meetings related to the rural educational revolution and the criticism of the revisionist educational line, and from the proposal of the textbook outline to the completion of the draft, the entire textbook, from form to content, from chapters to examples, all came from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The teachers in the compilation group deeply felt that in the past, they always thought that intellectuals were the natural "chief editors" of textbooks. Countless facts have educated us that the poor and lower-middle peasants are the most knowledgeable and understand education the best. They are the best "chief editors" of the new textbooks.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The trial textbooks for the first year of rural primary schools with attached junior middle school classes in Jianyang County were produced by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students in the great criticism of the revisionist educational line. The poor and lower-middle peasants exposed the three major crimes of the old textbooks: first, they peddled the black goods of the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and revisionism, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism; second, they were seriously detached from the actual conditions of revolution and production, and students could not use what they learned; third, they promoted pedantic philosophy, damaging the physical and mental health of young people. In response to this, the poor and lower-middle peasants demanded that the new textbooks adhere to the following three principles:

First, all subjects must be guided by the thoughts of Mao Zedong, emphasize proletarian politics, and discuss class and class struggle everywhere. Take the mathematics course, for example. In the past, mathematics courses were unrelated to proletarian politics. The old junior middle school mathematics course first discussed "the concept of numbers," but the trial textbooks, according to the requirements of the poor and lower-middle peasants, first solved the problem of "for whom to calculate." The first lesson combines the characteristics of algebra and starts with calculating the accounts of landlord exploitation. The course on the basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production originally taught technology, but each chapter first explains the brilliant instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on the development of this industry, so that students not only learn technology but, more importantly, learn the thoughts of Mao Zedong.

Second, all subjects must closely link with the actual conditions of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation in rural areas. Jianyang County is a major cotton-producing area, but the old junior middle school "botany" course did not relate to local conditions at all, and students called it "cotton from the book." The new textbooks, according to the requirements of the poor and lower-middle peasants, included for the first time in the textbook the famous cotton-growing labor model Zhang Sizhou and the poor and lower-middle peasants who jointly researched and successfully developed the variety "Cotton Farmer 14." The poor and lower-middle peasants and students called it "our cotton."

Third, be concise and precise. According to Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th" directive and the principle of being concise and precise, the old junior middle school's eight or nine courses were completely disrupted, and three new courses were set up: the course on the thoughts of Mao Zedong, the course on the basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production, and the mathematics course.

The trial textbooks compiled according to these three principles are welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and students.

### 简阳县依靠贫下中农编写出农村中学试用教材

    遵照伟大领袖毛主席“教材要彻底改革”的教导
    简阳县依靠贫下中农编写出农村中学试用教材
    新教材突出无产阶级政治，紧密联系农村阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的实际，内容少而精，广大贫下中农和学生都很欢迎
    四川省简阳县广大贫下中农和革命师生，遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席“教材要彻底改革”的教导，以毛主席的教育革命思想为武器，从农村的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动需要出发，在三个多月时间内，编写出一套农村小学附设初中班一年级的试用教材。他们编写教材的方法，为实行教材改革提供了一些初步经验。
    简阳县的农村教育革命今年年初就开展起来，各公社纷纷办起了小学附设初中班，贫下中农掌握了文权，推荐了许多优秀青少年入学，贫下中农和革命师生都十分高兴。但是，初中班的学生学什么？在当时，除了以毛主席的光辉著作为主课以外，其它课程还没有合适的新教材。有个别学校按旧初中那一套，开设了物理、化学、代数、几何、植物、动物等七、八门课，更多的一些学校则由几个教师坐在屋子里把原来的旧教材压缩删减一番，算作改革。贫下中农对这种现象很不满，他们说，这和原来的中学有啥两样？
    这个问题引起了简阳县革委会的重视，他们认为，过去的旧教材充满着封、资、修的黑货，为了培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，决不能用旧教材，必须对教材彻底改革。为此，从七月份开始，县革委会从全县各地挑选了二十多名革命的中、小学教师和学生，组成了教材编写小组，要他们遵照毛主席“教材要彻底改革”的指示，依靠群众，编写出一套闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的教材来。
    在三个多月时间内，编写组的同志走遍十七个公社，几十个生产队，参加了近百次有关农村教育革命的座谈会和对修正主义教育路线的批判会，从教材提纲的提出到初稿写成，整个教材，从形式到内容，从章节到例题，都来自广大贫下中农。编写组的教师们深有感受地说，过去一直认为知识分子是教材的当然“主编”，无数事实教育了我们，贫下中农最有学问，最懂教育，他们才是新教材最好的“主编”。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”简阳县农村小学附设初中班一年级的试用教材，就是广大贫下中农、革命师生在大破修正主义教育路线的革命大批判中产生的。贫下中农控诉了旧教材的三大罪状：第一，大肆贩卖封、资、修黑货，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道；第二，严重脱离革命、生产的实际，学生学了不能用；第三，大搞烦琐哲学，摧残青少年的身心健康。针对这点，贫下中农要求新教材体现下列三大原则：
    第一，各门功课都要用毛泽东思想统帅，突出无产阶级政治，要处处讲阶级和阶级斗争。拿数学课来说，过去的数学课与无产阶级政治是毫不相关的，旧初中数学课首先讲“数的概念”，而试用教材就根据贫下中农的要求，首先解决“为谁算”的问题，第一节就结合代数的特点，从算地主的剥削账讲起。工农业生产基础知识课本来是讲技术的，但是它每章前面都首先讲解伟大领袖毛主席关于发展该项事业的光辉指示，使学生不仅学习技术，更重要地学到了毛泽东思想。
    第二，各门功课都要紧密联系农村阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的实际。简阳县是棉花主产区，可是旧初中的“植物学”上讲的棉花，与本地根本联系不上，学生称之为“书上的棉花”，新教材则根据贫下中农的要求，把本县著名植棉劳动模范张泗洲和贫下中农一块研究成功的良种“棉农十四号”，第一次写进了教科书，贫下中农和学生称之为“我们的棉花”。
    第三，少而精。按照毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示和少而精的原则，把旧初中八、九门课全部打乱，新设了三项课，即：毛泽东思想课，工农业生产基础知识课和数学课。
    按照这三个原则编写出来的试用教材，广大贫下中农和学生都很欢迎。
