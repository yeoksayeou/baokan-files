The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The key to educational reform lies in the teachers." The practice of educational revolution over the past year or so has proven that the revolutionary transformation of the teaching staff is a crucial aspect of implementing Chairman Mao's educational revolution thoughts.

There are three issues that need to be addressed:
1. Eliminate class enemies who have infiltrated the teaching staff;
2. Have workers, peasants, and soldiers take to the lectern to fundamentally change the composition of the teaching staff;
3. Provide re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers to the existing teaching staff to fundamentally change their old ideas. To achieve this goal, I propose implementing a rotation system for urban primary and secondary school teachers. The specific measures are as follows:

1. Reduce the number of teaching staff. Taking Beijing as an example, originally there were an average of 1.8 teachers per class, which can be reduced to 1 teacher per class or 2 teachers for 3 classes. The remaining staff can work as workers or community members, or go to the educational department's self-managed farms to work.

2. Select a small number of workers and community members from factories and rural areas to serve as full-time or part-time teachers in schools.

3. In the future, teachers (whether from factories and rural areas or originally from the teaching staff) will generally rotate every two to three years, i.e., teach for two to three years, return to factories and rural areas to work for two to three years, then return to teach for two to three years, and so on, in a continuous cycle.

4. The provincial, municipal, and county revolutionary committees will take the lead, with factories (teams) and schools forming fixed partnerships, and under the leadership of workers and military propaganda teams, they will coordinate and comprehensively consider all aspects.

I believe that doing so has several advantages:

1. Teachers come from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are both teachers and members of the working class, which can fundamentally change the bourgeois intellectuals' control over schools.

2. Teachers teach for two years and then return to the working class for two to three years of "study," ensuring that teachers do not become detached from labor, from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and from reality.

3. Schools, factories, and rural areas will always have "new people" coming and going, which can make schools, factories, and rural areas vibrant.

4. Continuing this rotation can make more people care about the growth of the next generation, and everyone will educate the next generation according to Chairman Mao's instructions, which is of great significance in preventing and guarding against revisionism.

    城市中小学教员实行轮换制好
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“教改的问题，主要是教员问题。”近一年多来，教育革命的实践证明，教员队伍的革命化问题，是落实毛主席教育革命思想的重要一环。
    这里有三个问题需要解决：（1）将混进教员队伍的阶级敌人清除出去；（2）工农兵走上讲台，彻底改变教员成份；（3）对现有教员队伍由工农兵给以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。为了实现这个目的，我建议城市中小学教员实行轮换制。具体办法是：
    一、压缩教员编制。以北京为例，原来一个教学班平均一点八个教员，可以缩为一班一个或三班两个教员。余下的人员，当工人、社员，或到教育部门自办的农场里去劳动。
    二、从工厂农村抽调少量工人、社员到学校专任或兼任教员。
    三、以后，教员（不管是工厂农村来的，还是原来的教员）一般都两三年分期分批倒换，即当两三年教员，回工厂农村当两三年工人、社员，再回学校当两三年教员，再回工厂农村，如此循环下去。
    四、省市县革委会统一领导，厂（队）校固定挂钩，在工人、解放军宣传队领导下统筹安排，全面照顾。
    我考虑这样做有几个好处：
    ①教员来自工农兵，既是教员又是工农兵一分子，可以彻底改变资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治。
    ②教员教两年书回工农中去“进修”两三年，使教员不脱离劳动，不脱离工农兵，不脱离实际。
    ③学校和工厂、农村，总有“新人”进进出出，可以使学校、工厂、农村朝气蓬勃。
    ④长此倒换下去，可以使更多的人关心下一代成长，都会按照毛主席的指示教育下一代，这对反修防修有重大意义。
