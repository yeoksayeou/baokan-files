According to Indian newspapers, American imperialism has long been conducting large-scale, rampant cultural aggression against India. American imperialists, under the guise of cultural and educational activities, have been engaging in extensive espionage. They have been trying every means to control India's cultural and educational departments, peddling so-called "American culture," and engaging in spiritual enslavement to serve their new colonialism. American imperialism has always referred to India as the "democratic showcase of Asia." In reality, India is a "showcase" for American military control and economic plunder of Asian countries, and it is also a "showcase" for their cultural aggression.

Nearly twenty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Compared to other imperialist countries, American imperialism, over a long period, has paid more attention to spiritual aggression, from religious activities to so-called 'charitable' and cultural activities." In the past, American imperialism conducted extensive spiritual aggression against China; now, it is still doing the same in many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions. American imperialism understands that to invade and enslave a country and maintain its colonial rule there, besides using various military and economic means, it must also use spiritual weapons, that is, it must do counter-revolutionary work in the ideological sphere.

American imperialism has two purposes in conducting cultural aggression. One is to use the most decadent, most reactionary, and most ugly imperialist culture and so-called "American way of life," to use pro-American, fear-of-American, and pro-American thoughts to poison and corrupt the masses, to inject them with spiritual opium, to put spiritual shackles on them, so that they do not rise up to rebel against imperialism and its running dogs. The other purpose is to use so-called "cultural and educational activities" to cultivate lackeys who serve imperialism and to cultivate imperialist agents.

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "We are now in a new great era of world revolution." The peoples of the world are awakening more than ever before, and they are increasingly recognizing the aggressive and decadent nature of imperialism. American imperialism's cultural aggression activities, like its political, economic, and military aggression activities, are encountering increasingly strong resistance and opposition from the peoples of various countries. American imperialism can buy a handful of compradors and lackeys in India and other countries, but it cannot buy the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses. The "showcase" of American cultural aggression in India will one day be smashed to pieces by the revolutionary people of India!

### 美帝文化侵略的“橱窗”

    美帝文化侵略的“橱窗”
    据印度报刊报道，长期以来美帝国主义对印度进行了大规模的猖狂的文化侵略。美帝国主义者不仅打着搞文化办教育的幌子大干特务活动，而且千方百计地控制印度的文化教育部门，贩卖所谓“美国文化”，从事精神奴役，来为它推行新殖民主义服务。美帝国主义一向把印度叫作亚洲的“民主橱窗”，其实印度是美帝对亚洲国家进行军事控制、经济掠夺的一个“橱窗”，也是它搞文化侵略的一个“橱窗”。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在将近二十年前就曾经指出：“美帝国主义比较其他帝国主义国家，在很长的时期内，更加注重精神侵略方面的活动，由宗教事业而推广到‘慈善’事业和文化事业。”过去，美帝国主义对中国是大搞精神侵略的；现在，它对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和其他地区的许多国家，还正在这样干。美帝国主义懂得，它要去侵略和奴役一个国家，要在那里维持它的殖民统治，除了使用各种军事的和经济的手段之外，还必须使用精神武器，也就是要做反革命的意识形态方面的工作。
    美帝国主义大搞文化侵略有两个目的。一个目的是，用最腐朽的、最反动的、最丑恶的帝国主义文化和所谓“美国生活方式”，用崇美、恐美、亲美思想，来毒害和腐蚀人民群众，向他们灌输精神的鸦片，给他们套上精神的枷锁，使他们不要起来造帝国主义及其走狗的反。再一个目的是，通过所谓“文化教育事业”来培养为帝国主义服务的洋奴，培养帝国主义的代理人。
    但是，正如毛主席所指出的，“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。”世界各国人民正在空前觉醒，他们越来越认清了帝国主义的侵略本质和腐朽本质。美帝国主义的文化侵略活动，也和它在政治、经济、军事等方面的侵略活动一样，遭到了各国人民日益强烈的抵制和反对。美帝国主义可以在印度和其他一些国家收买一小撮买办、奴才，却收买不了广大革命人民的心。印度这个美帝文化侵略的“橱窗”，终有一天要被印度革命人民砸个稀巴烂！
