The people's armed forces in northern Thailand, in Pengsali, Phetchabun, and Lamphun provinces, have been fighting bravely and continuously achieving new victories.

According to a report from the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, on the 15th, the people's armed forces in Phetchabun Province ambushed a convoy of enemy vehicles on the Lung Khao Road, annihilating all 12 enemy soldiers on board, seizing nine guns, and a batch of bullets and hand grenades.

On the 17th, the U.S.-Thanom clique dispatched troops and helicopters to rescue the "Special Police Unit" surrounded by the people's armed forces in Wang Khao village, Wang Mai district, Lamphun Province. When the U.S.-Thanom clique's helicopters, loaded with wounded soldiers, were about to take off to escape, the people's armed forces launched a fierce attack with hand grenades, killing eight enemies on the spot and wounding many more.

According to incomplete statistics, from November 21 to December 15, the people's armed forces and people in Pengsali, Phetchabun, and Lamphun provinces jointly annihilated approximately 150 U.S.-Thai reactionary soldiers and police, destroyed or damaged 10 enemy helicopters, destroyed or damaged four enemy vehicles, burned down three enemy "command posts" and "offices," and seized a batch of weapons and military supplies.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 19th, emphasizing that the glorious victories achieved by the people's armed forces in Pengsali, Phetchabun, and Lamphun provinces under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand fully demonstrate the power of people's war, pushing the revolutionary situation in Thailand to develop more rapidly.

The article states that this victory greatly encouraged the patriotic people of the entire country, making them more clearly understand that the path of armed struggle led by the Thai Communist Party is the only way to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Thailand, overthrow the fascist dictatorship and traitorous Thanom clique that bring disaster to the country, and seize political power for the people.

The article states that in the battle, the people's armed forces flexibly and effectively employed the strategy and tactics of "you fight your way, I fight mine; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat," fighting bravely and keeping the enemy in a passive and defensive position, demonstrating the power of people's war.

The article points out that now, the people of the entire country see more clearly that the U.S.-Thanom clique, armed to the teeth, appears strong but actually has no formidable power; they are merely paper tigers.

The article points out that the development of people's armed struggle and continuous victories are heavily striking the rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique, making their attempt to use political deception to trick the people into abandoning armed struggle and prolonging their reactionary rule continuously fail.

The article concludes by calling on the Thai people to unite more closely, expand patriotic democratic forces more broadly, launch fierce attacks on the U.S.-Thanom clique, let the flames of people's war burn more fiercely in every place, and make the U.S.-Thanom clique fall into the raging flames of people's war.

    美国—他侬集团十七日出动军队和直升飞机，去营救在黎府浪使县万其陶村被人民武装包围的“警察别动队”。当美国—他侬集团的直升飞机满载残兵准备起飞逃走时，人民武装用手榴弹猛烈袭击，当场炸死敌人八名炸伤多名。
    据不完全统计，从十一月二十一日到十二月十五日，彭世洛、碧差汶和黎府的人民武装和人民，共歼灭美泰反动军警约一百五十人，击毁击伤敌人直升飞机十架，击毁击坏敌人军车四辆，烧毁敌人“指挥部”和“办事处”三处，缴获一批武器和军事物资。

    文章说，这次胜利极大地鼓舞了全国爱国人民，使全国人民更清楚认识到，泰共领导下的武装斗争道路，是驱逐美国侵略者出泰国，推翻法西斯独裁、祸国殃民的他侬卖国集团，把政权夺到人民手里的唯一出路。
    文章说，人民武装在战斗中灵活有效地运用“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走”的战略战术，英勇战斗，使敌人一直处于被动挨打的地位，显示了人民战争的威力。
    文章指出，现在，全国人民更清楚地看到，武装到牙齿的美国—他侬集团看起来样子是强大的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量，它们不过是一只纸老虎。
    文章指出，人民武装斗争的发展和不断取得胜利，正在沉重地冲击着美国—他侬集团的统治，使它们企图用政治骗局来诱骗人民放弃武装斗争，以延长它们反动统治寿命的阴谋不断遭到破产。
    文章最后号召泰国人民更紧密地团结起来，更广泛地发展爱国民主力量，奋起猛烈进攻美国—他侬集团，让人民战争的烈火在各地烧得更旺，使美国—他侬集团陷入人民战争熊熊烈火之中。
