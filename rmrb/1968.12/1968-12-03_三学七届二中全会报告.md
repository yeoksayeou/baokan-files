Upon entering the Dalian Jinguang Chemical Factory, one could hear workers praising the Revolutionary Committee Chairman and military representative Li Shutang. This is the story of Li Shutang studying Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee.

Defeating the Attack of "Sugar-Coated Cannonballs"

One day, Li Shutang, a management staff member of a certain regiment, along with several other left-supporting PLA comrades, arrived at the Dalian Jinguang Chemical Factory with red books in hand and backpacks on their backs. Upon arrival, they were led into a neat office and comfortable dormitory by someone designated by the capitalist roaders. Li Shutang took a look: the office was furnished with sofas, swivel chairs, and two automatic telephones; the dormitory had four single beds with brand-new blankets. Looking out the glass window, he saw that the factory area was overgrown with weeds, piled high with scrap iron and wooden crates. He immediately felt that something was amiss and said to everyone:

"Do not open your backpacks; let's hold a party branch meeting first." During the meeting, they opened Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," and recited in unison: "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns; they are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated cannonballs, and they will be defeated in front of sugar cannonballs. We must prevent this situation." Everyone, facing the current scene, studied Chairman Mao's great teachings from nineteen years ago, feeling particularly moved and close to heart. Comrades said, "This is not the place for us to stay." Finally, Li Shutang said, "Let's go to the workers!" The four of them picked up their backpacks and moved into a warehouse to stay.

Seeing this plan fail, the capitalist roaders in the factory came up with another scheme. They noticed that Li Shutang only ate coarse grains, so they instructed someone to say to them, "You might not be full eating coarse grains." They proposed to allocate fine grains. Li Shutang looked at the canteen with no tables or chairs, lacking bowls and chopsticks, and saw workers holding their lunch boxes, either squatting or standing to eat. He thought:

"You don't care about the masses, but you are so concerned about us? A fox visiting a henhouse can't have good intentions." The capitalist roaders sent people four times to propose allocating fine grains, all of which were rejected by Li Shutang. He firmly said, "I grew up eating acorn flour as a laborer. Eating coarse grains, not only am I full, but I also eat very well."

Maintaining the Spirit of Hard Work and Self-Denial

Not long after the establishment of the factory Revolutionary Committee, Li Shutang heard some comrades say, "Now that we are in power, we should also ride in small cars." It turned out that the factory had a small car that had long been enjoyed by the capitalist roaders. Li Shutang immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Chairman Mao said, "Because of victory, arrogance, the emotion of considering oneself a hero, the emotion of stopping progress, the emotion of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life may grow." Through the study, everyone felt that Chairman Mao's words hit the nail on the head, and they were deeply moved and educated. Finally, they unanimously proposed to convert the small car into an ambulance to serve all the workers in the factory.

Li Shutang did not stop at the measure of not riding in small cars. He then led all members of the Revolutionary Committee to go up the mountain to dig wild vegetables and eat bitter meals. Li Shutang, holding a bowl of wild vegetable porridge, said to everyone: My family has been working for the landlord for three generations, eating pig and dog food, and doing ox and horse work. My father worked for the landlord, worked himself to death with tuberculosis, and died at the age of forty-one. At that time, the poor had no roof over their heads and no place to stand. My father died and didn't even have a place to be buried. I was a half-servant for the landlord as a child, enduring beatings and scoldings, and later went to work as a laborer, eating acorn flour... Why were we so poor at that time? It was because the power was in the hands of the landlords and capitalists.

Hearing these words, the comrades were deeply moved and said, "We have taken the power from the hands of the capitalist roaders. If we alienate the masses, this power will eventually be lost!" From then on, they firmly remembered Chairman Mao's repeated instructions: "We must always maintain a humble, prudent, and modest attitude, and always maintain the spirit of hard work and self-denial," and insisted on learning, working, and living with the workers. Usually, Li Shutang always had a backpack on his back, and wherever he went, he worked there, found problems there, and solved them there. The workers all affectionately said, "Every corner of the factory is Old Li's office."

Relying Wholeheartedly on the Working Class

One day, several technicians in the factory brought design drawings to Li Shutang, saying, "Comrade Li, please sign your name." Li Shutang took the drawings and saw that they were for the large kiln in the water glass section. This was a long-standing problem in the factory that had not been well solved. In the past, the capitalist roaders had implemented Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, which was always: technicians design, leaders sign, and workers work. Because the technicians were detached from reality, the large kilns they designed not only had high labor intensity and a lot of dust but also had short furnace life, needing to stop production for major repairs after less than a year.

Li Shutang held the drawings and thought of the old workers telling him about these situations, feeling very moved. He thought: Building this large kiln is full of struggles between the two lines. Chairman Mao emphasized in his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee that we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi shouted that the working class is "unreliable," which is extremely reactionary! Thinking of this, Li Shutang returned the drawings to the technicians and said to them, "I cannot sign this. The workers must sign!" He then reviewed with them Chairman Mao's great teaching of "wholeheartedly relying on the working class." Li Shutang took the technicians to the water glass workshop. After the workers looked at the drawings, they raised some problems that needed to be solved. After returning, the several technicians were at a loss for a long time and still could not solve the problem. Li Shutang said to them, "If you can't think of a solution, ask the workers, and you will have a solution." Later, Li Shutang organized several on-site meetings combining workers, cadres, and technicians, and finally designed an advanced plan, solving the long-standing problem.

    三学七届二中全会报告
    一走进大连金光化工厂，就听到工人们在夸赞革委会主任、军代表李树棠。这里记述的是李树棠三学毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告的故事。
      打退“糖衣炮弹”的攻击
    一天，某师管理员李树棠和其他几位支左的解放军同志，带着红彤彤的宝书，背着背包来到金光化工厂。他们一来就被走资派指派的人领进一间漂亮的办公室和舒适的宿舍。李树棠一看：办公室里摆着沙发、转椅和两台自动电话；宿舍里四张单人床上铺着崭新的毛毯。透过玻璃窗往外一望，厂房周围杂草丛生，堆满了废铁、木箱。他马上感到：这里面有文章，便对大家说：
  “不要打开背包，咱们先开个党小组会。”会上，他们翻开毛主席的光辉著作《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，齐声朗诵着：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”大家面对着眼前的情景，学习毛主席十九年前的伟大教导，心情特别激动，感到特别亲切。同志们说：“这里不是咱们住的地方。”最后，李树棠说：“咱们到工人中间去！”四个人背起背包找了一个仓库住了下来。
    厂里的走资派一见此计不成，又生一计。他看到李树棠尽吃粗粮，就指使人对他们说：“你们吃粗粮怕吃不饱。”提出要拨细粮。李树棠同志望着食堂里没桌没凳、缺碗少筷，吃饭时工人们端着饭盒不是蹲着就是站着吃，心想：
  “你对群众不问不管，怎么对我们这么关心？黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，一定没安好心。”走资派一连四次派人提出要拨细粮都被李树棠顶了回去，他坚决地说：“我是当劳工吃橡子面长大的，吃粗粮，不但吃得很饱，而且吃得很好。”
      永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风
    厂革委会刚成立不久，李树棠听见有的同志说：“咱们现在掌权了，也该坐坐小汽车了。”原来，厂里有一辆小汽车，过去长期被走资派享用。李树棠马上组织大家学习了毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，毛主席说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”通过学习，大家感到：毛主席的话正打中了自己的要害，很受震动，很受教育，最后一致提出：应该把这辆小汽车改为救护车，为全厂工人服务。
    李树棠并没有满足不坐小汽车的措施。接着，他又带领革委会全体成员到山上去挖野菜，吃忆苦饭。李树棠端着野菜糊糊对大家说：我家三辈子都给地主扛大活，吃的是猪狗食，干的牛马活。我爹给地主扛活，累成了伤痨，四十一岁就死了。那时穷人上无片瓦，下无立足之地，我爹死了连个埋的地方都没有。我从小给地主当半拉子，挨打受骂，后来又去当劳工，吃橡子面……那时咱穷人为啥这样苦？就是因为权在地主资本家手里。
    听了这一席话，同志们深受感动，说：“咱们把权从走资派手里夺了回来，要是脱离了群众，这个权迟早还要丢！”从此，他们牢牢记住毛主席的谆谆教导：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”，坚持和工人们学习、劳动、生活在一起。平时，李树棠身上总是背个背包，走到那里就在那里办公，在那里发现问题就在那里解决，工人们都亲切地说：“厂子里哪块地方，都是老李的办公室。”
      全心全意地依靠工人阶级
    一天，厂里几个技术人员拿着设计好的图纸来找李树棠，说：“李主任，请你签个字。”李树棠拿过图纸一看，原来是水玻璃工段的大窑。这是厂里的一个“老大难”问题，一直没有得到很好的解决。过去，走资派推行的是
  一条刘少奇的反革命修正主义办企业路线，从来就是：技术人员设计，领导签字，工人干活。由于技术员脱离实际，设计出来的大窑不但劳动强度大，粉尘多，而且炉子的寿命短，不到一年就得停产进行大修。
    李树棠拿着图纸，想起老工人给他讲过的这些情况，心里很激动，他想：修建这座大窑充满了两条路线的尖锐斗争。毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告中所强调的，必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级。可是，大叛徒刘少奇却大肆叫嚣工人阶级“不可靠”，真是反动透顶！想到这里，李树棠把图纸交给技术人员，对他们说：“这个字我不能签，必须让工人来签！”说完，就和他们重温了毛主席“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”的伟大教导，李树棠带着技术人员来到水玻璃车间。工人们看完图纸，提出了一些需要解决的问题。回来后，几个技术员憋了半天，还是没法解决。李树棠对他们说：“想不出办法，向工人请教，就有了办法。”后来，李树棠又一连组织几次工人、干部和技术人员相结合的现场会，终于设计出一个先进方案，解决了“老大难”问题。　师文革、战斗兵
