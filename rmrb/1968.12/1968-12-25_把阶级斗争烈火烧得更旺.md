The flames of class struggle burn ever brighter. In the blast furnace shop of the No. 3 Steel Plant, soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Military Training Class are holding aloft their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," fiercely denouncing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle."

The class leader and crane operator, Zhu Jincheng, spoke passionately: "This scoundrel Liu Shaoqi claims that the domestic enemies have been eliminated. Comrades, tell me, have they really been eliminated?!"

"No!" the comrades responded in unison. Amidst the roars of "Down with Liu Shaoqi!" a fiery voice rang out from the crowd: "The class enemies are still alive and kicking. Aren't the die-hard capitalist roaders in our shop just like that?!" Everyone looked, and it was Wu Liben, a worker from the iron-melting furnace.

Old Wu stepped forward, his voice trembling with anger: "This guy, before liberation, was a member of the yellow union, a spy who specialized in oppressing workers. After liberation, he transformed himself, infiltrated the Party, and seized the position of shop director, continuing to impose bourgeois dictatorship on the workers. During the Cultural Revolution, he played both sides, inciting workers to fight against each other. Isn't he a class enemy? Isn't the class struggle still alive? This is outrageous!"

Speaking of this, Old Wu clenched his fists in anger. Old Wu came from a poor family, relying on his father and brother to pull rickshaws for a living. He himself started picking up straw to make a living at a young age. Thinking of the bitterness of the old society, how could Old Wu not be filled with rage? He said excitedly: "We laboring people suffered under the oppression of landlords, capitalists, and the reactionary Kuomintang in the old society. But after liberation, Liu Shaoqi sheltered these bad elements. Isn't this making us become slaves again and suffer twice? Can we agree to this?"

"No! We absolutely cannot agree!" Old Wu's voice grew louder: "This capitalist roader in our shop, not only did he hide under Liu Shaoqi's protection, but he also gathered a group of bad elements, shouting slogans for the restoration of capitalism, and using every means to fight to the death with the working class. Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of the extinction of class struggle' is even more poisonous than poison, a soft knife that kills without bloodshed."

Master Wu spoke for everyone's heart. The flames of criticism against Liu Shaoqi burned even brighter. Everyone chimed in, each word like a sharp sword, piercing Liu Shaoqi's black heart.

"Ding! Ding! Ding!..." The bell for pouring steel rang. The steelworkers rolled up their sleeves, carrying their hatred for Liu Shaoqi, and rushed to the fiery steel-smelting platform and the pouring station. The slogans "Down with the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi!" and "Never forget class struggle!" echoed alongside the roar of the machines, resonating inside and outside the shop. A new battle has begun.

    把阶级斗争烈火烧得更旺
    万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。上钢三厂平炉车间毛泽东思想军训班的战士手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，正在狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    军训班班长、行车工储金诚激动万分地说道：“刘少奇这个坏蛋胡说国内敌人已经消灭了。你们大伙说说，到底消灭了没有？！”
    “没有！”同志们异口同声地回答。在一阵阵“打倒刘少奇”的怒吼声中，人群中响起一个火辣辣的声音：“阶级敌人人还在心不死，我们车间的顽固不化的走资派不就是这样的家伙吗？”大伙一看，是化铁炉工人吴立本。
    老吴师傅一步跨到前头，愤怒地说：“这个家伙，解放前是黄色工会理事，一个专门欺压工人的特务。解放后摇身一变，钻进党内，窃据了车间主任的职务，继续对工人实行资产阶级专政。文化大革命中，他大耍反革命两面派手法，挑动群众斗群众。难道他不是阶级敌人吗？难道阶级斗争已经消灭了吗？真是岂有此理！”
    讲到这里，老吴气得攥紧拳头。老吴是受苦出身，从小靠父亲、哥哥拉黄包车过活，自己小小年纪就去拾草糊口。想起旧社会的苦，怎不叫老吴怒火万丈。他激动地说：“我们劳动人民在旧社会受尽地主、资本家和国民党反动派的压迫。可是，解放后，刘少奇把一些坏家伙包庇下来，这不是要我们重新做牛马，再吃二遍苦吗？大家说，我们能答应吗？”
    “不答应！”“对！我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！”老吴越说劲越粗：“我们车间的这个走资派，不仅自己在刘少奇的庇护下隐藏了下来，而且又搜罗了一些坏人，为复辟资本主义摇旗呐喊，千方百计地和我们工人阶级进行‘拚死的斗争’。刘少奇的‘阶级斗争熄灭论’，真是比毒药还毒，是一把杀人不见血的软刀子。”
    吴师傅讲的是大伙共同的心声。批判刘少奇的烈火烧得更旺了。大家你一言、我一语，句句象利剑，直刺刘少奇的黑心。
    “当！当！当！……”出钢的钟声响了。钢铁工人们一挽衣袖，带着对刘少奇的满腔仇恨，奔上了火红的炼钢炉台和出钢口。“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”“千万不要忘记阶级斗争！”的口号声，伴随着机器的轰鸣，在车间内外激荡回响。一场新的战斗又开始了。
