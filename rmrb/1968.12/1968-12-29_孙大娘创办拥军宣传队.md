This day, the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought from the Second Platoon of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, under the setting sun, was heading towards the official village of Fengjia Commune in Rushan County, Shandong. They were specially going to perform for the commune members. As soon as they reached the village entrance, they were greeted by the sound of drums and gongs. Following this, a propaganda team composed of housewives emerged from the crowd, welcoming them. There is a story behind this propaganda team.

This spring, the comrades of the Second Platoon responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production," and went to the village. They not only propagated Mao Zedong Thought but also helped the commune members carry water and combat drought. These deeds were seen by the military family member, Old Madame Sun Changqing, who was moved to tears and praised the soldiers trained by Chairman Mao whenever she saw anyone.

Madame Sun, with her love for the People's Liberation Army, took meticulous care of the comrades from the Second Platoon who came to the village to propagate. Once, the comrades from the Second Platoon encountered a torrential downpour on their way here, and their bodies were soaked through. After the soldiers entered the village, Old Madame Sun was extremely worried. She held an umbrella and went from house to house, borrowing over seventy pieces of clothing, which she brought to the comrades, urging them to change into dry clothes. However, the comrades repeatedly declined, politely refusing Old Madame's kindness.

From then on, Madame Sun felt even more guilty and thought day and night about how to spread the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army. After much thought, she finally made up her mind: to compile the deeds of the soldiers helping the poor and lower-middle peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively after coming to the village, and the moving stories of everyone loving Chairman Mao in the village into performances, and to establish a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought to perform for the comrades of the People's Liberation Army.

Madame Sun busied herself among the neighboring women, organizing this matter. In a few days, she first established a Mao Zedong Thought study class on the kang (a traditional heated bed). The first lesson studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "supporting the military and loving the people." Under Madame Sun's mobilization and organization, the study class quickly became a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought composed of housewives.

This day, someone said that the propaganda team of the Second Platoon was coming to the village. Madame Sun heard this and decided to seize this opportunity to perform with the military propaganda team.

As the performance began, the military and the people together sang, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" Following this, the stage presented wonderful artistic performances. The atmosphere on and off the stage was filled with class love between the military and the people, with the military loving the people and the people supporting the military, and the military and the people uniting as one. Amidst the applause, the poor and lower-middle peasants all praised, "The performances of the propaganda team established by Madame Sun truly express what is in our hearts."

    孙大娘创办拥军宣传队
    这天，解放军某部二连的毛泽东思想宣传队，迎着满天的彩霞，正向山东乳山县冯家公社官庄大队进发。这是他们特地去为社员们演出节目。刚到村头，迎面送来了阵阵锣鼓声，紧接着，在一片欢迎的人群中，拥出一支由家庭妇女组成的毛泽东思想宣传队。提起这支宣传队来，还有一段故事。
    今年春天，二连的同志响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，到这村里，又宣传毛泽东思想，又帮助社员们挑水抗旱。这一桩桩的事，被军属老大娘孙常青看在眼里，喜在心上，感动得逢人就夸奖毛主席培养出来的战士就是好！
    孙大娘怀着对人民解放军的热爱，对来村宣传的二连同志照顾得周周到到。一次，二连的同志又来这里，路上忽然遇上了瓢泼大雨，浑身被雨淋了个透湿。战士们进村后，可急坏了孙大娘。老人打着雨伞，挨家挨户地借来七十多件衣服，送到了同志们的面前，催促着大家赶快换上干衣裳。但大家再三推辞，婉言谢绝了大娘的一番心意。
    打这，孙大娘更觉过意不去，整天想着用什么方法传播解放军的优良作风。她想来想去，终于打定了主意：把解放军来村后，帮助贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作，村里出现的人人热爱毛主席的动人事迹，编排成节目，再办起一个毛泽东思想宣传队来，给解放军同志演一演。
    于是，孙大娘整天在邻居妇女们中张罗着这件事。不几天，先办起了炕头毛泽东思想学习班，开学第一课就学习了毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大教导。在孙大娘的动员组织下，学习班很快变成了一个家庭妇女毛泽东思想宣传队。
    这天，有人说二连的宣传队要进村，孙大娘听到后，决定趁这个机会和解放军的宣传队合场演出。
    演出一开场，军民首先齐声歌唱“敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！”紧接着，舞台上演出了精采的文艺节目，台上台下，充满着军爱民，民拥军，军民团结一条心的阶级友爱气氛。阵阵掌声中，贫下中农都夸奖说：“孙大娘创办的这个宣传队演的节目，真把俺们心里的话都说出来了。”
