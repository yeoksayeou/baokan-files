After the publication of the communiqu√© of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Yong'an Commune, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism, fiercely denouncing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Maochi and his agents. Below are excerpts from their speeches.

Education Must Serve Proletarian Politics

Yan Gaofu (poor peasant) and Wang Mingzhen (poor peasant, female production team leader): Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy must enable those who receive an education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become workers with socialist consciousness and culture." Chairman Mao's educational policy is the only correct policy for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. However, the great traitor, great spy, and great scab Siu Maochi, in an attempt to restore capitalism, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, advocating "intellectual education first," "reading books to become officials," and so on. This counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line has usurped the political power of the working class and poor peasants.

What is Siu Maochi's "intellectual education first"? For which class does it serve? We poor peasants see it most clearly.

Siu Maochi's line is the same as that of the past landlord class and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the past, the landlord class emphasized "ten years of hard study" to become scholars, pass the imperial examinations, and become officials, lording over the people and enjoying privileges. The Kuomintang reactionaries did the same. In our village, there was a landlord who was a fake village chief. This fellow was a propagandist for the "reading books to become officials" theory. He shamelessly promoted the idea that having culture meant becoming an official. Once, he pretended to care about the poor, telling Yan Gaofu's father: "You should send your child to school!" Yan Gaofu's father said: "We can't even eat, how can we study?" This fellow boasted: "Without education, you'll be poor for life. If I hadn't studied, how could I have become a village chief? Now, when we walk together, who do people greet first, you or me?" This fellow was arrested and punished after liberation. When he was arrested, he told his wife: "Even if you have to sell all our property, you must send the children to school. Only by studying can they have a future." This landlord, although punished by the people, still harbored hopes of "reading books to become officials," wanting his descendants to follow in his footsteps. Siu Maochi vigorously promoted "intellectual education first," which exactly suited the needs of the overthrown landlord class and Kuomintang reactionaries, serving the exploiting class.

Tian Hanyu (poor peasant): The great traitor Siu Maochi relentlessly instilled the idea of "intellectual education first" into the youth. His reactionary purpose was to compete with the proletariat for the youth, attempting to lead them away from proletarian politics and onto the path of "peaceful evolution," pursuing personal fame and fortune, and rising in official ranks. Our brigade has a shocking fact: Two youths, under the influence of Siu Maochi's "study, strive to study, and study the best," fought to enter middle school while in primary school and then rushed to enter university. The higher they rose, the bigger their eyes became. They truly became "one year of soil, two years of foreign influence, three years of not recognizing father and mother," with their feet not touching the soil and hands not getting dirty, always striving to rise. One finished high school, and the other graduated from university. The state arranged their jobs, but because they were deeply poisoned by Siu Maochi's "reading books to become officials" theory, they were dissatisfied with the state's allocation, thinking it was a "waste of talent" and "buried their talents." They started from extremely serious bourgeois individualism, developed to dissatisfaction with the Party and socialism, and step by step degenerated into active counter-revolutionaries. This is the evidence of Siu Maochi's promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the most profound exposure of the reactionary nature of Siu Maochi's "intellectual education first."

Zhang Rongzhong (poor peasant, production team leader): Siu Maochi promoted "intellectual education first" to serve the exploiting class and cultivate successors to the bourgeoisie. Therefore, he used every means to restrict, exclude, and strike at the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from entering school. His agents in various places, to implement this counter-revolutionary revisionist line, set up various barriers for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enter school, excluding a large number of them from the school gates. Our children of poor and lower-middle peasants generally entered school later, so they set an "age" barrier. Student Yu Changgui, from a poor peasant family, had three generations of begging, and his four older brothers did not study due to family difficulties. After liberation, his parents decided to let Yu Changgui study, "no longer to be blind." He managed to study up to the fifth grade, but the school considered him too old and forced him to drop out. However, a son of a counter-revolutionary, who started studying early and did not pass the entrance exam for junior high school, was allowed to repeat two years and enter junior high school on the grounds of being "too young to work." Our children of poor and lower-middle peasants, after entering school, still had to work and do household chores, and were not just bookworms. If their scores were low, they were considered "stupid" and "useless," and were struck and excluded.

Proletarian Revolutionary Successors Must Grow in Storms and Waves

Yang Dongsheng (brigade party branch secretary): Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow in the storms of the great revolution." He also said: "We Communist Party members should experience wind and rain and see the world." Chairman Mao's teachings are the only correct path for the healthy growth of our youth. However, the great traitor Siu Maochi vigorously opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, opposed students participating in the three great revolutionary movements, opposed education combining with productive labor, and pushed the "intellectual education first" black goods, vigorously advocating "two ears not hearing outside affairs, one heart only reading the classics." This is the "closed-door cultivation" he advocated in his black "Cultivation." Under the domination of Siu Maochi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, although schools were set up in the countryside, they were separated from the poor and lower-middle peasants by thousands of mountains and rivers; students entering the school were like entering another world. Students only buried their heads in books, not asking about class struggle, not talking about crop yields. When the brigade fought against class enemies, poor and lower-middle peasants invited teachers and students to participate, but the school said it would "disrupt the teaching order" and not let teachers and students participate; during busy farming seasons, they were asked to help the brigade with labor for a few days, but they did not do it, saying it would "affect teaching quality." Poor and lower-middle peasants said: The school door is like a government office, the masses cannot enter, and students cannot come out. Just like this, the longer the students stayed in school, the farther they were from the struggle, and the more distant their feelings were from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They truly became more stupid the more they read. Once, I talked to a student and asked him: "What is class?" He could not answer. I asked him: "How are landlords?" He said: "The teachers talked about landlords, they were the fat, big-bellied, wearing bamboo hats, and holding water pipes in the past, but now it has been more than ten years since liberation, there are no landlords." It really made one's lungs burst with anger! Comrade Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." If you do not understand the past bitterness, you will not know the present sweetness. Our children of poor and lower-middle peasants do not even know what landlords are, how can they understand? Siu Maochi advocated "intellectual education first," precisely to make the descendants of poor and lower-middle peasants forget class struggle and become their captives, so that they can smoothly restore capitalism.

Chen Renta (brigade poor and lower-middle peasant educational revolution committee member): Siu Maochi wanted students to "two ears not hearing outside affairs, one heart only reading the classics," but what did they read? In my opinion, it is called one ancient and two foreign. The more they read, the more confused they became. "Intellectual education first" turned students into ignorant fools, misleading the younger generation. The fourth brigade had a junior high school graduate who did not pass the high school entrance exam and returned home to work. Poor and lower-middle peasants were very happy and elected him as an accountant, hoping he could manage the accounts well. However, this junior high school graduate, who had studied for nine years, could not even manage the year-end settlement and could not come up with a distribution plan. Poor and lower-middle peasants sighed, and he was also anxious. In the past, they only blamed the students for not understanding and having no future; in fact, it was because he read the "classics" that Siu Maochi believed in, and did not learn what we poor and lower-middle peasants needed. Siu Maochi vigorously promoted "intellectual education first," precisely to make students not serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, turning them into "young masters" who are detached from politics, workers and peasants, and labor, becoming his tools for restoring capitalism.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Manage Schools

Xue Delin (brigade poor and lower-middle peasant educational revolution committee director) and Zhou Dashan (brigade poor and lower-middle peasant educational revolution committee member): Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." The struggle between the two lines on the educational front is also concentrated on the issue of "power." We have deep lessons in this regard. In 1958, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we broke through some of the old school's rules and regulations, implementing the policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must combine with productive labor." However, we did not seize back the power and change the situation of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools. Soon, some schools went back on their words. Take Shangqiao Primary School as an example: Since liberation, it has had five principals and three directors, including traitors, spies, and landlord elements. These fellows, under the protection of Siu Maochi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, seized the educational power. Take Victory Primary School as another example: The principal of this school was a landlord's wife, and her husband was a traitor who sold out revolutionary comrades. This landlord's wife took revenge on the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and students and parents jointly wrote letters to report her, driving her away. However, the one who came was her traitor husband, truly "a monkey left, and a Mr. Sun came." This fellow even more severely persecuted the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, forcing them to drop out of school. One hundred and seventy students were reduced to thirty-two. This is a piece of evidence of the great traitor Siu Maochi's attempt to restore capitalism by surrendering and recruiting traitors.

The communiqu√© of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism." We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, resolutely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.
