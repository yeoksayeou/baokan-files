After the publication of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Yong'an Commune, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism, fiercely denouncing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Maochi and his agents. Below are excerpts from their speeches.

Education Must Serve Proletarian Politics

Yan Gaofu (poor peasant) and Wang Mingzhen (poor peasant, female production team leader): Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy must enable those who receive an education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become workers with socialist consciousness and culture." Chairman Mao's educational policy is the only correct policy for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. However, the great traitor, great spy, and great scab Siu Maochi, in an attempt to restore capitalism, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, advocating "intellectual education first," "reading books to become officials," and so on. This counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line has usurped the political power of the working class and poor peasants.

What is Siu Maochi's "intellectual education first"? For which class does it serve? We poor peasants see it most clearly.

Siu Maochi's line is the same as that of the past landlord class and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the past, the landlord class emphasized "ten years of hard study" to become scholars, pass the imperial examinations, and become officials, lording over the people and enjoying privileges. The Kuomintang reactionaries did the same. In our village, there was a landlord who was a fake village chief. This fellow was a propagandist for the "reading books to become officials" theory. He shamelessly promoted the idea that having culture meant becoming an official. Once, he pretended to care about the poor, telling Yan Gaofu's father: "You should send your child to school!" Yan Gaofu's father said: "We can't even eat, how can we study?" This fellow boasted: "Without education, you'll be poor for life. If I hadn't studied, how could I have become a village chief? Now, when we walk together, who do people greet first, you or me?" This fellow was arrested and punished after liberation. When he was arrested, he told his wife: "Even if you have to sell all our property, you must send the children to school. Only by studying can they have a future." This landlord, although punished by the people, still harbored hopes of "reading books to become officials," wanting his descendants to follow in his footsteps. Siu Maochi vigorously promoted "intellectual education first," which exactly suited the needs of the overthrown landlord class and Kuomintang reactionaries, serving the exploiting class.

Tian Hanyu (poor peasant): The great traitor Siu Maochi relentlessly instilled the idea of "intellectual education first" into the youth. His reactionary purpose was to compete with the proletariat for the youth, attempting to lead them away from proletarian politics and onto the path of "peaceful evolution," pursuing personal fame and fortune, and rising in official ranks. Our brigade has a shocking fact: Two youths, under the influence of Siu Maochi's "study, strive to study, and study the best," fought to enter middle school while in primary school and then rushed to enter university. The higher they rose, the bigger their eyes became. They truly became "one year of soil, two years of foreign influence, three years of not recognizing father and mother," with their feet not touching the soil and hands not getting dirty, always striving to rise. One finished high school, and the other graduated from university. The state arranged their jobs, but because they were deeply poisoned by Siu Maochi's "reading books to become officials" theory, they were dissatisfied with the state's allocation, thinking it was a "waste of talent" and "buried their talents." They started from extremely serious bourgeois individualism, developed to dissatisfaction with the Party and socialism, and step by step degenerated into active counter-revolutionaries. This is the evidence of Siu Maochi's promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the most profound exposure of the reactionary nature of Siu Maochi's "intellectual education first."

Zhang Rongzhong (poor peasant, production team leader): Siu Maochi promoted "intellectual education first" to serve the exploiting class and cultivate successors to the bourgeoisie. Therefore, he used every means to restrict, exclude, and strike at the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from entering school. His agents in various places, to implement this counter-revolutionary revisionist line, set up various barriers for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enter school, excluding a large number of them from the school gates. Our children of poor and lower-middle peasants generally entered school later, so they set an "age" barrier. Student Yu Changgui, from a poor peasant family, had three generations of begging, and his four older brothers did not study due to family difficulties. After liberation, his parents decided to let Yu Changgui study, "no longer to be blind." He managed to study up to the fifth grade, but the school considered him too old and forced him to drop out. However, a son of a counter-revolutionary, who started studying early and did not pass the entrance exam for junior high school, was allowed to repeat two years and enter junior high school on the grounds of being "too young to work." Our children of poor and lower-middle peasants, after entering school, still had to work and do household chores, and were not just bookworms. If their scores were low, they were considered "stupid" and "useless," and were struck and excluded.

Proletarian Revolutionary Successors Must Grow in Storms and Waves

Yang Dongsheng (brigade party branch secretary): Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow in the storms of the great revolution." He also said: "We Communist Party members should experience wind and rain and see the world." Chairman Mao's teachings are the only correct path for the healthy growth of our youth. However, the great traitor Siu Maochi vigorously opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, opposed students participating in the three great revolutionary movements, opposed education combining with productive labor, and pushed the "intellectual education first" black goods, vigorously advocating "two ears not hearing outside affairs, one heart only reading the classics." This is the "closed-door cultivation" he advocated in his black "Cultivation." Under the domination of Siu Maochi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, although schools were set up in the countryside, they were separated from the poor and lower-middle peasants by thousands of mountains and rivers; students entering the school were like entering another world. Students only buried their heads in books, not asking about class struggle, not talking about crop yields. When the brigade fought against class enemies, poor and lower-middle peasants invited teachers and students to participate, but the school said it would "disrupt the teaching order" and not let teachers and students participate; during busy farming seasons, they were asked to help the brigade with labor for a few days, but they did not do it, saying it would "affect teaching quality." Poor and lower-middle peasants said: The school door is like a government office, the masses cannot enter, and students cannot come out. Just like this, the longer the students stayed in school, the farther they were from the struggle, and the more distant their feelings were from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They truly became more stupid the more they read. Once, I talked to a student and asked him: "What is class?" He could not answer. I asked him: "How are landlords?" He said: "The teachers talked about landlords, they were the fat, big-bellied, wearing bamboo hats, and holding water pipes in the past, but now it has been more than ten years since liberation, there are no landlords." It really made one's lungs burst with anger! Comrade Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." If you do not understand the past bitterness, you will not know the present sweetness. Our children of poor and lower-middle peasants do not even know what landlords are, how can they understand? Siu Maochi advocated "intellectual education first," precisely to make the descendants of poor and lower-middle peasants forget class struggle and become their captives, so that they can smoothly restore capitalism.

Chen Renta (brigade poor and lower-middle peasant educational revolution committee member): Siu Maochi wanted students to "two ears not hearing outside affairs, one heart only reading the classics," but what did they read? In my opinion, it is called one ancient and two foreign. The more they read, the more confused they became. "Intellectual education first" turned students into ignorant fools, misleading the younger generation. The fourth brigade had a junior high school graduate who did not pass the high school entrance exam and returned home to work. Poor and lower-middle peasants were very happy and elected him as an accountant, hoping he could manage the accounts well. However, this junior high school graduate, who had studied for nine years, could not even manage the year-end settlement and could not come up with a distribution plan. Poor and lower-middle peasants sighed, and he was also anxious. In the past, they only blamed the students for not understanding and having no future; in fact, it was because he read the "classics" that Siu Maochi believed in, and did not learn what we poor and lower-middle peasants needed. Siu Maochi vigorously promoted "intellectual education first," precisely to make students not serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, turning them into "young masters" who are detached from politics, workers and peasants, and labor, becoming his tools for restoring capitalism.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Manage Schools

Xue Delin (brigade poor and lower-middle peasant educational revolution committee director) and Zhou Dashan (brigade poor and lower-middle peasant educational revolution committee member): Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." The struggle between the two lines on the educational front is also concentrated on the issue of "power." We have deep lessons in this regard. In 1958, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we broke through some of the old school's rules and regulations, implementing the policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must combine with productive labor." However, we did not seize back the power and change the situation of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools. Soon, some schools went back on their words. Take Shangqiao Primary School as an example: Since liberation, it has had five principals and three directors, including traitors, spies, and landlord elements. These fellows, under the protection of Siu Maochi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, seized the educational power. Take Victory Primary School as another example: The principal of this school was a landlord's wife, and her husband was a traitor who sold out revolutionary comrades. This landlord's wife took revenge on the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and students and parents jointly wrote letters to report her, driving her away. However, the one who came was her traitor husband, truly "a monkey left, and a Mr. Sun came." This fellow even more severely persecuted the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, forcing them to drop out of school. One hundred and seventy students were reduced to thirty-two. This is a piece of evidence of the great traitor Siu Maochi's attempt to restore capitalism by surrendering and recruiting traitors.

The communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism." We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, resolutely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    坚持政治挂帅　狠批“智育第一”
    ——江苏省泰兴县永安公社贫下中农批判刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表以后，江苏省泰兴县永安公社的广大贫下中农，又一次掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行反革命修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行。下面是他们的发言摘要。
    教育必须为无产阶级政治服务
    严高福（贫农社员）、王明珍（贫农，女生产队长）：毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”毛主席提出的教育方针是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的唯一正确的方针。但是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，妄图复辟资本主义，拚命地推行反革命修正主义教育路线，鼓吹“智育第一”、“读书做官”等等。这条反革命修正主义教育路线，专了我们工人阶级和贫下中农的政。
    刘少奇的“智育第一”是什么货色？为哪个阶级服务？我们贫下中农看得最清楚。
    刘少奇的一套，就是过去地主阶级的一套，就是国民党反动派的一套。过去地主阶级就是拚命宣扬什么“十年寒窗”，考秀才、中举人、得状元，爬在人民头上作威作福，把读书作为升官发财的手段。国民党反动派也是这样。我们村里有个地主分子伪保长，这家伙就是“读书做官论”的吹鼓手。他不知羞耻地到处宣扬有文化就能做官。一次，他装成一副“关心”穷人的样子，对严高福的父亲说：“你要把伢儿送上学呀！”严高福的父亲说：“饭都吃不上，还念什么书！”这家伙得意洋洋地说：“不上学，没知识，就只有一世穷。我如果不读书，怎能当上保长呢！现在，我和你走在一起，人家是先喊你，还是先请教我？”这家伙解放后被捕法办了。在被捕时，他关照老婆：“你宁可把家产卖光，也要让孩子们上学，只有读书才有出路。”这个地主分子伪保长，虽然受到了人民的惩罚，但他心不死，还把希望寄托在“读书做官”上，要他的后代接他的班。刘少奇拚命宣扬“智育第一”，不正是适应了被打倒的地主阶级、国民党反动派的需要，为剥削阶级服务吗？
    田汉余（贫农社员）：
    大叛徒刘少奇拚命向青年灌输“智育第一”，他的反动目的，就是同无产阶级争夺青年一代，妄想把青年引上脱离无产阶级政治，一心追求个人名利、升官发财的“和平演变”的道路。我们大队就有这样一个触目惊心的事实：有两个青年，在刘少奇“升学、力求升学、升学最好”的毒害下，读小学时为考取中学而奋斗，读了中学忙考大学。他们升得越高，眼睛眶子越大，真是“一年土、二年洋、三年不认爹和娘”，脚不踏土，手不沾泥，一心向上爬。一个读完高中，一个大学毕业。国家安排了他们的工作，由于他们中刘少奇“读书做官论”的毒很深，对国家的分配不满，认为对他们是“大材小用”、“埋没了人材”。他们从极端严重的资产阶级个人主义思想开始，发展到对党、对社会主义不满，一步一步堕落下去，成了现行反革命。这就是刘少奇推行反革命修正主义教育路线的罪证，也最深刻地揭露了刘少奇“智育第一”的反动本质。
    张荣忠（贫农、生产队长）：
    刘少奇推行“智育第一”，是为剥削阶级服务，培养资产阶级接班人。因此，他千方百计地限制、排挤、打击贫下中农子女入学。他在各地的代理人，为了贯彻这条反革命修正主义路线，就对贫下中农子女入学设置了种种关卡，把大批贫下中农子女排斥在学校门外。我们贫下中农子女入学一般比较迟，他们就设一条“年龄”关。学生于长贵，家庭是个老贫农，过去三代讨饭，兄弟五人，前四个都因家庭困难没有读书。解放后，他父母下决心让于长贵念书，“不再做睁眼瞎子”。他好容易读到五年级，学校嫌他年龄大，强迫他退了学。可是一个反革命分子的儿子，读书早，小学毕业没考取初中，学校竟以“年龄小不能劳动”为借口，让他复读两年，送进了初中。我们贫下中农的孩子上了学还要劳动，做家务事，没有死读书，考分低，就被认为“脑子笨”，“不成材”，受到打击、排挤。
    无产阶级革命接班人要在大风大浪中成长
    杨冬生（大队党支部书记）：
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”又说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”。毛主席的教导是我们青年一代健康成长的唯一正确的道路。但是，大叛徒刘少奇竭力反对毛主席的革命路线，反对青年学生参加三大革命运动，反对教育同生产劳动相结合，推销“智育第一”黑货，大肆鼓吹“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”。这就是他在黑《修养》中鼓吹的那套“闭门修养”的货色。在刘少奇这条反革命修正主义路线的统治下，学校虽然办在农村，但和贫下中农隔了千山万水；学生进了学校，也就象到了另外一个世界。学生只管埋头读书，不问阶级斗争，不谈庄稼收成。队里斗争阶级敌人，贫下中农请师生参加，学校说什么“打乱了教学秩序”，不让师生参加；农忙时要师生帮队里劳动几天，也不干，说什么“劳动过多，影响教学质量”。贫下中农说：书房门大似衙门，群众进不去，学生出不来。就是这样，学生在学校呆得越久，脱离斗争越远，和贫下中农的感情越淡薄，真是书读得越多就越蠢。一次，我和一个学生谈话，我问他：“什么叫阶级？”他答不出。又问他：“地主怎么样？”他说：“地主的事老师讲过，就是解放前那些肥头胖脑、大肚子、戴瓜皮帽、捧水烟筒的家伙，现在已经解放十几年了，没有地主了。”真把人肺都气炸了！林副主席指示我们说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”不懂得过去的苦，就不知道今天的甜。我们贫下中农的子女连地主都不知道，怎么得了呢？刘少奇宣扬“智育第一”，就是要把贫下中农的后代弄得忘记阶级斗争，成为他们的俘虏，好让他们顺顺当当地复辟资本主义。
    陈仁太（大队贫下中农教育革命委员会委员）：
    刘少奇要学生“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，究竟读了些什么？照我看，叫做一古二洋。这些东西越读越糊涂。“智育第一”，把学生尽搞成一窍不通的糊涂虫，误人子弟。四队有个初中毕业生，没考上高中，回家劳动。贫下中农见了很高兴，推举他当会计，指望他能把账搞好。那知这个读了九年书的初中生，到了年终结算，账还搞不清，分配方案拿不出。贫下中农直叹气，他也急得团团转。过去只怪学生不懂事，没出息；实际上这是因为他读的是刘少奇信奉的“圣贤书”，没学我们贫下中农需要的这一套。刘少奇大搞“智育第一”，就是要学生不为贫下中农服务，把他们培养成脱离政治、脱离工农、脱离劳动的“少爷”，成为他复辟资本主义的工具。
    贫下中农必须管理学校
    薛德林（大队贫下中农教育革命委员会主任）、周大山（大队贫下中农教育革命委员会成员）：
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”教育战线上两条路线的斗争，也集中在一个“权”字上。这方面我们有深刻的教训。一九五八年，我们在毛主席革命路线的指引下，打破了旧学校的一些条条框框，贯彻执行了“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的方针。但是我们没有把权夺回来，改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的状况，不久，有些学校又走了回头路。拿上桥小学来说，解放以来，换了五个校长、三个教导主任，其中就有叛徒、特务、地主分子。这些家伙在刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的包庇下，掌握了教育大权。再拿胜利小学来说，这个学校的校长是个地主婆，她的丈夫是个出卖革命同志的叛徒。这个地主婆对贫下中农子女专搞阶级报复，学生和家长联名写信上告，把她轰走了。但调来的却是她的那个叛徒丈夫，真是“走了个猴子，来了个姓孙的”。这家伙更是变本加厉地对贫下中农子女进行迫害，逼得贫下中农子女纷纷退学，一百七十多个学生，只剩下三十二个。这就是大叛徒刘少奇招降纳叛、妄图复辟资本主义的一个罪证。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，传达了毛主席的最新指示：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”我们广大贫下中农坚决紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
