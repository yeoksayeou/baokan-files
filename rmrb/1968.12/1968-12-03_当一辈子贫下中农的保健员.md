I am a member of the militia and a health worker in Jiangzhangzi Brigade, Kuanceng County. Since I became a health worker, I have deeply felt that the "Three Articles" are the sharpest weapons for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. It is this sharp weapon that has helped me eliminate the poison of the revisionist line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi from my mind, enabling me to gradually establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

I attended school for five years and stopped in 1963. Although I was only fifteen years old at the time, my mind was full of selfish thoughts. I felt that there was no future in the countryside and always wanted to find a job outside. In October 1965, the brigade called me to the county hospital for training, which made me very happy. I thought, "Learn to be a nurse, work hard for a few years, and then become a doctor. That would be a successful career." When I arrived at the hospital, I found out that after the training, I would still return to the brigade as a health worker. I was disappointed and my thoughts were in turmoil: Should I learn? It's not what I want. Should I go back? I volunteered to come, so I can't explain it.

The next day, the training began. We learned about the great significance of semi-agricultural and semi-medical work and realized that the work of a health worker is indeed very important. Then we studied the "Three Articles" repeatedly, discussing them several times. The spirit of Comrade White, who served the Chinese people with a communist spirit, had a great impact on me. Chairman Mao called on us to "learn from his selfless spirit," and taught us: "A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as he has this spirit, he is a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has rid himself of low desires, and a person who benefits the people." I wondered, am I selfish if I don't want to stay in the countryside? I struggled with this for several days. At first, I found some reasons to justify leaving the countryside, but the more I struggled, the less convincing these reasons became. The more I struggled, the more I realized that not wanting to stay in the countryside was indeed selfish. I asked myself, do I want to be a pure person or an impure person? I often heard the elders in my family say: It was Chairman Mao who saved the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants from the hell of the old society. Only by listening to Chairman Mao and following him can the poor and lower-middle peasants have a bright future. I am a descendant of poor peasants. If I put myself first, it means I have forgotten my roots and am disloyal to Chairman Mao. Thinking of this, I made up my mind to be a pure person. During the Cultural Revolution, I criticized the black "Cultivation of the Self," and I realized that not wanting to stay in the countryside and wanting to become a doctor was due to my desire for fame and wealth, which was influenced by the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," and was poisoned by the black "Cultivation of the Self." I decided to study the "Three Articles" for a lifetime, struggle against selfishness for a lifetime, criticize revisionism for a lifetime, and be a health worker for the poor and lower-middle peasants for a lifetime!

I studied for a year and returned to the brigade as a health worker. When someone came to see me, I would take their temperature and give them some medicine. For minor ailments like headaches and fevers, I would treat them, and there were no infections from injections. I thought I was doing a good job. But some poor and lower-middle peasants were not satisfied and said, "It's a waste of time sending Shuyun for training." At first, I didn't understand. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions on medical work, I realized that although I was in the countryside, I did not actively go to the poor and lower-middle peasants to treat them. If they didn't come to me, I wouldn't bother. If I continued like this, wouldn't I become a "lord" health worker? I did not follow Chairman Mao's teachings, so how could the masses not have complaints? After finding the cause, I followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Because we are serving the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not be afraid of others pointing them out." I actively went to the masses to seek their opinions, provided medical services at their doors, and delivered medicine to the fields. There was a female peasant in our brigade who supported a family of six or seven with her right arm paralyzed for several years, unable to work, and had spent a lot of money without improvement. I originally thought that if the hospital couldn't cure the disease, I, as a health worker, had no reason to interfere. After studying, I realized that this was an irresponsible attitude towards the people, and I should try to cure her. I heard that acupuncture could treat this disease, so I learned and treated her. After half a month, I cured her disease, and the patient's family and I were both very happy. This incident made me realize that to be a pure person, I must always follow Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly change my worldview, and establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by our Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the interests of the people." I am a health worker, treating diseases for the masses and ensuring the health of the poor and lower-middle peasants is my duty to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. Although my education is low and my skills are poor, as long as I have a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao and a proletarian love for the poor and lower-middle peasants, I can overcome difficulties and do some things beneficial to the people.

Last year, a daughter of a poor peasant contracted whooping cough combined with pneumonia. I heard about it and went to her house. As soon as I entered the room, I saw a person performing a superstition ritual. I rushed over and found the child with a high fever of 40 degrees, convulsions, and unconsciousness. I told the child's mother, "It's pneumonia, not a 'little ghost stealing the soul'!" I gave the child medicine while persuading her to go to the hospital. However, the child's mother was very superstitious and not only refused to go to the hospital but also drove me away. I thought, this is not about me not serving the people, but about you not listening to me. Just as I was about to go home, I felt something was wrong: If I gave up after being driven away, it would not meet the requirements of "completely" and "thoroughly." This is an irresponsible attitude towards the poor peasants' lives. More importantly, the superstition ritual was harming the people. If I didn't interfere, it would allow these ghosts and demons to cause trouble, poisoning the masses' minds with feudal superstitions and disrupting socialist construction. This is also a class struggle! Thinking of this, I did not go home but stayed in the patient's neighbor's house, giving the child medicine on time. At midnight, the child was still unconscious, the superstition ritualist had left, and the child's mother was also anxious. At this time, I went to their house again, guarding and treating the child for three days and three nights, finally saving the child who had stopped breathing more than ten times. The child's mother was also educated and said, "It's still the doctors trained by Chairman Mao who are good!"

Our brigade has sixteen production teams living in two large gullies, with a distance of more than ten miles from one end to the other. One evening, I went out to treat a patient and returned home in a heavy rain. The road was dark and slippery, and I fell several times. Finally, I reached home, but I hadn't even changed my clothes when a team member from the third team came to find me to treat a patient. I thought it wasn't an emergency, so I could go tomorrow. I told the team member, "You go back first, I'll come early tomorrow morning." The team member left, and I thought, it's just a matter of personal hardship in the dark and heavy rain. For my personal convenience, I let the patient suffer for a night. How can this be considered "wholeheartedly serving the people"? This is still the poison of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi in my mind. I am a member of the militia and cannot be a "lord" health worker. I must be a medical soldier who comes when called, fights when arrived, and wins when fighting. So, I picked up my bag and ran out. The team member had just reached home, and I followed him in. He asked me, "Didn't you say you would come in the morning?" I said, "Chairman Mao told me to come immediately!"

This "country doctor" is easy to find, and I have cured several serious illnesses, so more people come to find me. One evening, a team member from Shizhuzhi Brigade came to find me to treat a patient. I hesitated: Should I go? I am a health worker for the brigade, not the commune. They have a health station. Should I not go? The team member has already walked several dozen miles, and the patient is waiting for me. I thought, Comrade White can come from Canada to China to treat diseases. Why can't I go to other brigades to serve the people? Since we want to be "completely" and "thoroughly" dedicated, we should not set boundaries or limits. I went to Shizhuzhi and found that the child had "meningitis," and there were two more with severe conditions and high risks. I had never treated this before and had no confidence. I was about to say, "You should find a doctor or go to the hospital," but I immediately refuted myself. This brigade is in a remote mountain valley. In the middle of the night, where can you find a doctor? Time delay may cause serious consequences. So, I treated the three children together, and after a day and a night of rescue, all three children were saved. Later, the masses of several nearby brigades often came to find me to treat diseases. Whenever I went to other brigades to treat diseases, I would be considered absent and would not be compensated with work points. Although my workload increased and my personal income decreased, I served the people more, and my mood was even more pleasant.

On one day in August last year, just as I was about to lie down to sleep, a team member came to tell me that someone had a sudden illness. When I arrived at their house, the patient had a high fever, headache, and stomachache, and I couldn't determine the disease. Soon, I found several more people with similar symptoms, and it turned out to be 1059 highly toxic pesticide poisoning. The number of poisoned people quickly rose to sixteen. I called the county hospital, and they said the ambulance was not available, and the doctors could not come. I was furious. I thought, what has the great traitor Liu Shaoqi done to our socialist medical system! They don't have a bit of class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants in their hearts! Although I had not experienced such a situation and did not have the rescue technique, I had Chairman Mao above and the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants below. I must take full responsibility for the safety of the sixteen class brothers. With the help of the masses, I gathered all the poisoned people and set up a temporary "hospital." I took temperatures, felt pulses, gave injections, and used medicine, staying up all night. Chairman Mao said, "The decisive factor is people, not things." This is a great truth. After active rescue, the sixteen poisoned class brothers, except for three who were taken away by the county hospital the next day, all recovered quickly.

Serving the people is something I should do, but the masses gave me great encouragement. They said, "Thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership, the doctors he trained are really good, spending little money and treating many diseases..." Hearing the praise of the broad masses, I thought, every bit of my progress and achievement is the result of Chairman Mao's guidance. The credit should go to our great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao taught us: "If socialism does not occupy the countryside, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." The brigade comrades saw that I had a great spirit of serving the people and mobilized me to take on the work of family planning. Later, I also became a new-style midwife. This caused a storm at home, and two kinds of thoughts engaged in fierce struggle.

One day, I had just returned from a county meeting, and as soon as I entered the door, my mother started arguing with me, scolding me until I was dizzy. My mother not only restricted me from delivering babies but also did not let me go out for night calls. Several times, I left home in a fight. I thought, solving the resistance at home is not a small matter but a big problem of the struggle between two lines and two kinds of thoughts. But how to solve it?

The struggle at home pressed me for a long time, and I couldn't eat. Just when I had no way out, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to hold study classes. Chairman Mao said, "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I organized a family Mao Zedong Thought study class with my younger brother and sister, determined to struggle against selfishness, criticize revisionism, and promote the revolutionization of the family.

As soon as the study class began, I studied the "Three Articles" with all the family members. My mother said to me, "You are like a circus performer, running around all day and not helping me with any work at night?" I didn't answer immediately, thinking, no matter how backward Mother's thoughts are, I must use the "Three Articles" to raise Mother's awareness. The study class continued day after day, and the "Three Articles" were read over and over again. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the three bright images in the "Three Articles" finally inspired Mother. One evening, after the family studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Mother said, "A foreigner came to China to treat diseases. This person has a good heart!" I seized the opportunity to study with her the teachings of Chairman Mao on serving the people. Then, in the study class, we recalled and compared, conducted class education. Grandpa said: In the old society, our family lived in Dasanyuan. Grandpa and my father were forced to work for the landlord, and they couldn't bear the oppression of the landlord. Grandpa took my little aunt, led Grandma and my father, and went to Weichang and other places to beg for food. But the world is full of crows, and they were also bullied by the landlord there. They had no choice but to escape back to Jiangzhangzi. The hometown was liberated, and Chairman Mao saved our whole family. Life gradually improved year by year. Grandpa cried as he spoke, and Mother also thought of the bitterness of the old society and cried even more. Our whole family cried.

Father said, "In the old society, there was no place to beg for food. Now we poor and lower-middle peasants have become the masters of the country, eating and wearing enough. In the past, what we could carry in a basket, now we can't even push in a car. Chairman Mao saved us, and we don't listen to Chairman Mao's words, thinking only of ourselves and not of the collective. This is forgetting our roots and being disloyal to Chairman Mao." I also examined my past thoughts of not wanting to stay in the countryside, fearing hardship, and not caring about the poor and lower-middle peasants. Class education is effective. Mother couldn't hold back and said, "I didn't let Shuyun go out for night calls and be a midwife. This is not listening to Chairman Mao's words and being poisoned by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi." She said to me, "Shuyun, you do a good job. I won't hold you back anymore!" Mother kept her word, and later, not only did she not restrict me, but she also helped me with many things.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought guided our whole family, and the class consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the whole family have been greatly improved. Later, Father was selected as an active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought in the district, and Mother became a model of criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism in the team. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

I have been a health worker for less than two years. The little work I have done and the little achievements I have made are all the results of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. My work process is the process of studying the "Three Articles," struggling against selfishness, repudiating revisionism, and changing my worldview. I deeply feel that the most important thing for a person is to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought and promote the revolutionization of thought; the best quality is to be selfless and dedicated to others; the greatest prospect is to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people!

    当一辈子贫下中农的保健员
    河北省军区活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、宽城县三异井公社蒋杖子大队保健员　张淑云
    学习“老三篇”，做个纯粹的人
    我是宽城县蒋杖子大队基干民兵、卫生保健员。我当保健员以来，深深感到：“老三篇”是斗私批修的最锐利的武器。正是这个锐利的武器，帮助我清除了大叛徒刘少奇修正主义路线在我头脑中的流毒，使我逐步树立了全心全意为贫下中农服务的思想。
    我上过五年学，一九六三年不上了。当时虽然才十五岁，但头脑里的“私”字很多，觉得在农村没出息，总想到外边找个工作。一九六五年十月，大队叫我到县医院学习，真把我乐坏了，心想：学习学习当个护士，好好干几年再熬个医生，那就有出息了。到医院一打听，原来学习完了还回大队当保健员。我一听凉了半截，思想里打起架来：学习吧，不随心；回去吧，自愿来的，没法交代。
    第二天开始学习了，我们学了半农半医的伟大意义，认识到保健员的工作确实很重要。接着我们又学习“老三篇”，反复地学习、讨论了几遍，白求恩同志为中国人民服务的共产主义精神，对我教育很大。毛主席号召我们要“学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神”，并教导我们：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”自己不愿在农村，是不是自私自利呢？一直斗争了好几天，开始还给自己离开农村找了一些理由，但是越斗，越觉得这些理由站不住脚；越斗，越觉得不想在农村就是自私自利。我问自己是当个纯粹的人呢，还是当个不纯粹的人？常听家里老人们讲：是毛主席他老人家，从旧社会的火坑中，救出了广大贫下中农，只有听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走，才有贫下中农的光明路。我是贫农的后代，“私”字当头就是忘本，就是对毛主席不忠。想到这，我下定决心，当个纯粹的人。文化大革命中，批判了黑《修养》，我才明白，不愿在农村，想熬个医生，是名利思想在作怪，是上了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇鼓吹的“吃小亏，占大便宜”的当，是中了黑《修养》的毒。我决心学习一辈子“老三篇”，斗一辈子私，批一辈子修，当一辈子贫下中农的保健员！
    我学习了一年回到大队，当了保健员。有找我看病的，就量量体温，给点药，头痛脑热的治好了，打针也没有化脓的，自己觉着干的挺不错。可是有的贫下中农不满意地说：“白叫淑云学习了。”开始听到这话，我想不通。后来学习了毛主席有关医务工作的指示，我才觉悟了，自己虽然身在农村，但没有主动去给贫下中农看病，人家不来找，我就不管，这样下去，不也成了“老爷”保健员了吗？我没有按照毛主席的教导去做，群众咋会没意见呢？找到了原因，我就遵照毛主席“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”的教导，主动地到群众中去征求意见，送医上门，送药到地。我队有个贫农女社员，家里六、七口人全仗她料理家务，她的右胳膊麻痹，好几年干不了活，花了不少钱，也没治好。原来我觉得医院治不好的病，我这个保健员不管满有理。经过学习，认识到这是对人民不负责任的态度，应该想办法给她治好。听说针灸可以治这种病，我就一边学，一边治，经过半个月的时间，把她的病治好了，病人全家和我都很高兴。这件事使我认识到：要当纯粹的人，必须时时按照毛主席的教导去做，不断改造世界观，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。
        学习“老三篇”，
      “完全”、“彻底”为人民
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我是一个保健员，为群众治病，保证贫下中农的健康，就是我“完全”、“彻底”为人民应尽的义务。我虽然文化低，技术差，但是，只要有一颗忠于毛主席的红心，有热爱贫下中农的无产阶级感情，就能战胜困难，做一些有利于人民的事。
    去年，一个贫农的女儿得了百日咳合并肺炎，我听说后就到她家去了。一进屋正赶上一个跳大仙的在那里胡说八道。我赶过去一看，孩子高烧四十度，抽搐、昏迷。我就向孩子的妈说：“是肺炎，不是‘小鬼打魂’！”一边给孩子用药，一边动员去住医院。可是孩子的妈挺迷信，不光不住院，还把我顶出来了。我心想：这可不是我不为人民服务，是你不听我的话。刚想往家走，又觉得不对头：挨了顶就不管，不符合“完全”、“彻底”的要求，这是对贫农后代的死活不负责任。更重要的是，跳大仙的装神弄鬼，苦害人民，我要是不管，就会让这些牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪，用封建迷信去毒害群众的思想，破坏社会主义建设。这也是一场阶级斗争啊！想到这些，我没有回家，就在病人家的隔壁住下来，按时间给孩子用药。到了半夜，孩子还在昏迷，跳大仙的溜了，孩子的妈也着了急。这时我又到了他们家，一连守护、治疗了三天三夜，终于把这个停止呼吸十几次的孩子治好了。孩子的妈也受到了教育，她说：“还是毛主席培养出来的医生好！”
    我们大队十六个生产队，居住在两个大沟，从这头到那头相隔十几里路。有一天晚上，我外出看病，回来时正赶上下大雨，天又黑、路又滑，一边走一边摔跟头。好容易到了家，衣服还没换，三队的一个社员又来找我去看病。我想不是急病，明天再去也行，就向这位社员说：“你先回去吧，明天起早我就去。”社员走了以后，我想：天黑、雨大，只是个人吃点苦的问题。为了个人不吃苦，就叫病人增加一夜的痛苦，怎能算是“全心全意地为人民服务”呢？这还是大叛徒刘少奇的流毒在我头脑里作怪。我是个基干民兵，不能当“老爷”保健员，要当一个召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜的卫生兵。于是我背起兜子就往外跑，那个社员到了家，我也随后进了门，他问我：“你不是说明天早晨来吗？”我说：“毛主席叫我马上来！”
    我这个土“医生”好“请”，又治好了几个比较严重的病症，找我的人就多了。有一天晚上，石柱子大队的一个社员，找我去看病。这事我可犯了考虑：去吧，我是个大队的保健员，不是公社的，人家那里有卫生所；不去吧，人家已经跑了几十里路，而且病人正在等着我。我想：白求恩同志可以从加拿大到中国来治病，我为啥不能到外队为人民服务？既然要“完全”、“彻底”，就不应该划出个范围、界限来。我到石柱子一看，孩子的病是“流行性脑膜炎”，一打听还有两个，病情很重，危险性很大，我又没治过，心里实在没有底。刚想说你们找个医生或者去住院吧，马上又反驳了自己。这个大队是偏僻的山沟，深更半夜的到哪去找医生？时间一耽误，可能造成严重后果。于是，我就把三个孩子一块治，经过一天一夜的抢救，三个孩子都脱险了。以后，附近几个大队的群众，时常找我去看病。我凡是到外队去治病，就算缺勤，不要补贴工分。虽然工作量增加了，个人收入少了，但为人民服务多了，心情也就更愉快了。
    去年八月的一天，我刚要躺下睡觉，一个社员找我说有人得了急病。到他们家一看，病人发高烧，头疼肚子疼，确定不了是啥病。不一会又发现好几个同样的病，这才弄清是1059烈性农药中毒。中毒的人很快发展到十六名。我给县医院打电话，县医院说救护车不在，医生去不了。我一听就火了。我想：大叛徒刘少奇把我们社会主义医疗事业搞成了什么样子！他们心里哪有一点贫下中农的阶级感情！我虽然没有经过这样的场面，也不会抢救的技术，但是，上有毛主席，下有贫下中农的支持，对十六名阶级弟兄的安全，我必须负起全部责任。在群众的帮助下，我把中毒的人全部集中起来，办起一个临时“医院”。量体温，摸脉搏，打针，用药，整整一夜没合眼。毛主席说：
  “决定的因素是人不是物”，这是伟大的真理。经过积极抢救，十六个中毒的阶级弟兄，除了县医院第二天接走了三个人，都很快地好了。
    为人民服务，本来是我应该做的事，群众却给了我很大的鼓励，他们说：“多亏毛主席的好领导，培养的医生实在好，花的钱不多，治的病不少。……”听了广大群众的赞扬，我就想：我的每一点进步和成绩，都是毛主席他老人家指引的结果，成绩应该归功于我们伟大领袖毛主席。
  学习“老三篇”，促进家庭革命化
    毛主席教导我们说：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”大队的同志见我为人民服务的劲头挺大，动员我把计划生育的工作也担起来，后来，我又当上了新法接生员。这样一来，在家里就引起了一场风波，两种思想展开了激烈的斗争。
    有一天，我刚从县里开会回来，一进门，我妈就和我吵起来了，把我骂了个昏头胀脑。我妈不光限制我接生，夜间出诊也不叫出去了，一连几次都是打着架走的。我想：解决家庭的阻力，这不是一件小事，也是一场两条路线、两种思想斗争的大问题。可是怎么解决呢？
    家庭的斗争，压得我好久吃不下饭。正在我没有办法的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了大办学习班的伟大号召。毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”按照毛主席的教导，我串连弟弟妹妹办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班，下定决心斗私批修，促进家庭革命化。
    学习班一开始，我就和全家人一起学习“老三篇”。我妈对我说：“你象跑马戏的，白天到处跑，晚上还不帮我干点活？”我没马上答言，心里想，不管妈的思想怎么落后，也得用“老三篇”提高妈的觉悟。学习班一天接一天地办，“老三篇”一遍又一遍地念，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，“老三篇”中的三个光辉形象，终于使我妈受到了启发。一天晚上，全家人学了《纪念白求恩》以后，我妈说：“一个外国人到中国来治病，这个人的心眼可真好！”我就抓住机会和她一起学习毛主席教导的为人民服务的道理。接着，我们在学习班上又回忆对比，进行阶级教育。爷爷说：在旧社会，我们家住在大桑园，爷爷和你爸爸被迫给地主扛活，实在受不了地主老财的压迫，爷爷便挑着你小姑姑，领着奶奶和你爸爸，到围场等地要饭去了。可是天下乌鸦一般黑，到那里也受地主老财的气，没法子又逃了回来，落在了蒋杖子。家乡解放了，毛主席救了我们全家，生活才一年年地好起来。爷爷边说边哭，妈妈也想起了旧社会的苦，哭得更厉害。我们全家都哭了。
    我爸爸说：“旧社会要饭都没处要去，现在我们贫下中农当了国家主人，吃饱穿暖，过去用一挑子挑走的，现在一车子也推不了。毛主席救了咱们，还不听毛主席的话，净寻思个人，不想集体，这是忘本，这是对毛主席的不忠。”我也检查了过去不愿在农村、怕苦，以及对贫下中农不关心等错误思想。阶级教育一抓就灵。我妈忍不住了，她说：“我不叫淑云出诊、当接生员，是不听毛主席的话，是中了大叛徒刘少奇的毒。”她向我说：“淑云，你好好干吧，我再不拉你的后腿！”我妈说到做到，以后不光不限制我，还帮我做了不少事。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅了我们全家，全家人的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高。后来，我爸爸被选为区的活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，妈妈也成为队里的斗私批修标兵。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    我当保健员还不到二年。所做的一点工作，取得的一点成绩，都是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。我工作的过程，就是学习“老三篇”，斗私批修，改造世界观的过程。我深深体会到：一个人，最最要紧的是活学活用毛泽东思想，促进思想革命化；最好的品质，是毫不利己专门利人；最大的前途，是“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务！
