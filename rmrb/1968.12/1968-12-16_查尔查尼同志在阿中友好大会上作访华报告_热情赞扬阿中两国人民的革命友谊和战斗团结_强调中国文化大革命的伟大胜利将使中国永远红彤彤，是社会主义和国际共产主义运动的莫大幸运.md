The Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association held an Albanian-Chinese Friendship Conference at the Tirana Cultural Palace on the evening of December 13. Comrade Qemal Cami, head of the Albanian government's economic delegation to China and a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, delivered a report at the conference, sharing his impressions of his visit to China. In his report, he enthusiastically praised the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and warmly sang the praises of the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of Albania and China.

On the stage, there were large portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. The national flags of Albania and China were also displayed. The stage also had a banner with the words of Comrade Enver Hoxha: "The great Albanian-Chinese friendship is a pure, deep, and everlasting friendship."

Comrades Muftiu, the First Secretary of the Tirana Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Theodhori, the Minister of Industry and Mines, Jakova, the General Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions, Pacrami, the Secretary of the Tirana Committee of the Labor Party, Bita, the Head of the International Department of the Central Committee, Budo, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Treska, the Chairman of the Albanian Foreign Cultural Relations Committee, and Dumani, the Vice-Chairman of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, as well as workers, soldiers, cadres, and students from the capital, attended the conference.

Li Tingyuan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Zhongxuan, the Military Attaché, Zhou Ping, the Economic Counselor, and other staff members of the embassy also attended the conference.

Comrade Theodhori presided over the conference.

In his report, Comrade Cami first spoke about the extremely warm reception given to the Albanian government's economic delegation by the Chinese people, and the sincere revolutionary sentiments they hold for the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. He said that Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and other leaders have highly evaluated the great revolutionary work being done in Albania, highly evaluated Albania's great role in defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism in the current international communist movement, and highly evaluated Comrade Enver Hoxha's principled and persistent struggle against imperialism and revisionism, Comrade Enver Hoxha's correct leadership of our country in advancing along the socialist road, and Comrade Hoxha's outstanding speeches on worker supervision, school revolutionization, and other aspects.

He said that the current situation in China is excellent. The proletarian cultural revolution has achieved decisive victories, and the entire Chinese people have an infinite love and loyalty to Chairman Mao Zedong and his thoughts. They effectively grasp Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, and the entire people are studying Chairman Mao Zedong's works. These are signs of an excellent situation.

Comrade Cami went on to say that they visited the hometown of Comrade Mao Zedong and saw an exhibition hall that reflected Comrade Mao Zedong's life as a thorough and steadfast revolutionary. Through this exhibition hall and other exhibitions they visited, it is clear that Comrade Mao Zedong has dedicated his entire life and work to the people, the party, and the revolution.

He said that the Chinese people have a deep hatred for the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and domestic revisionists like Liu Shaoqi and his agents. Everywhere, in every unit, they are exposing the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and the damage caused by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary line.

There is a struggle between two lines in China, between the Marxist-Leninist line of Comrade Mao Zedong and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi. Through the proletarian cultural revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line has achieved victory.

He said that China is now all red. This is a great victory.

Comrade Cami then enthusiastically praised the very important role played by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the past and present. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Mao Zedong, and has always advanced along the correct path.

After introducing the Chinese people's implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions on struggle, criticism, transformation, the leadership of the working class in everything, the down-to-the-countryside movement, educational revolution, the admission of advanced elements of the working class into the party, and the cleansing of class ranks, Comrade Cami said that in China, a very great work of political and ideological education of the masses is being carried out. There, the extremely great work of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is being carried out. Everywhere, the instruction to emphasize proletarian politics is being implemented. The performances are all revolutionary themes. Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have been organized and are doing great work in various places.

Comrade Cami highly evaluated the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He said that this plenary session thoroughly exposed the traitor, scab, and running dog of imperialism, the Kuomintang, and revisionism, Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices; decided to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party permanently and revoke all his party and state positions; and decided to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Party. This plenary session was warmly welcomed by all the working people.

Comrade Cami pointed out that the great significance of the victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is immeasurable. This makes the great People's Republic of China, which occupies such an important position in the world, forever red. This is a great fortune for the socialist and international communist movement. If there had not been the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong in this life-and-death struggle against the Chinese revisionist agents, a great disaster would have occurred. This victory is also our victory because the People's Republic of China is our great friend, our great comrade-in-arms, and a sincere friend who assists and supports us in all circumstances and in all aspects.

After speaking about the brilliant achievements in China's industry and agriculture, Comrade Cami said that our visit to China was a success, and everywhere we went, we saw the eternal friendship between Albania and China, forged by our two parties and by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong. This is a great internationalist friendship that embodies mutual assistance.

Comrade Cami concluded by saying that we wish the great Chinese people greater and greater achievements in the proletarian cultural revolution, and we wish Comrade Mao Zedong long life, eternal life! To benefit China and the entire world revolution.

Comrade Cami's report was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and shouts of slogans. The audience stood up many times, shouting: "Enver-Mao Zedong," "Friendship is a guarantee," "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!"

    强调中国文化大革命的伟大胜利将使中国永远红彤彤，是社会主义和国际共产主义运动的莫大幸运
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚—中国友好协会十三日晚在地拉那文化宫举行了阿中友好大会，不久前访问过中国的阿尔巴尼亚政府经济代表团团长、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席查尔查尼同志在大会上作报告，畅谈了访华观感。他在报告中热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，热情歌颂阿中两国人民之间的革命友谊和战斗团结。
    会场主席台上，高挂着阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的画像，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像，阿中两国国旗。主席台上还悬挂着恩维尔·霍查同志的语录：“伟大的阿中友谊是纯洁的、深厚的和不朽的友谊。”
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党地拉那委员会第一书记穆夫蒂乌、工矿部部长蒂奥多西、工会中央理事会总书记雅科瓦、劳动党地拉那委员会书记帕奇拉米、劳动党中央国际部部长比塔、外交部副部长布多、阿尔巴尼亚对外文委主席特雷斯卡和阿中友协副主席杜马等同志，以及首都的职工、战士、机关干部和学生出席了大会。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃、武官李钟玄、经济参赞周平和大使馆的其他工作人员也出席了大会。
    工矿部部长蒂奥多西同志主持了大会。
    查尔查尼同志在报告中首先谈到中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚政府经济代表团极其热情的接待，对阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志所怀有的真挚的革命情谊。他说，毛泽东同志、林彪同志以及周恩来同志等领导人，高度地评价正在阿尔巴尼亚进行的巨大的革命工作，高度地评价阿尔巴尼亚在当前国际共产主义运动中为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性所起的巨大作用。他们高度地评价我们亲爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为反对帝国主义和修正主义所进行的原则性的和坚持不懈的斗争、霍查同志对沿着社会主义道路前进的我国的正确领导和他的马克思列宁主义的行动以及霍查同志关于工人阶级监督、学校革命化等方面的杰出的讲话。
    他说，中国目前的形势大好。无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，全中国人民对毛泽东主席和他的思想无限热爱和无限忠诚，以有效的方法掌握毛泽东主席的思想，全国人民都在学习毛泽东主席的著作，这些都是形势大好的标志。
    查尔查尼同志接着说，我们访问了毛泽东同志的家乡，我们参观了一个陈列馆，这个陈列馆反映了毛泽东同志作为一个彻底的和坚定不移的革命者的生平。通过这一陈列馆和我们参观过的其它一些展览，可以清楚地看到，毛泽东同志把他的全部生活和工作都贡献给人民、党和革命。
    他说，中国人民对美帝、苏修和本国的修正主义分子刘少奇及其代理人充满了深刻的憎恨。全国各地、各单位都在以事实来揭露刘少奇的罪行，揭露刘少奇的反革命路线所造成的损害。
    中国存在着两条路线的斗争，即毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义路线和刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线之间的斗争。通过无产阶级文化大革命，毛泽东同志的革命路线已经取得了胜利。
    他说，中国现在实现了全国一片红。这是伟大的胜利。
    查尔查尼接着热情地赞扬了中国人民解放军过去和现在所起的十分重要的作用。他说，中国人民解放军是由毛泽东同志的亲密战友林彪同志直接指挥的，一直沿着正确的道路前进。
    查尔查尼同志在介绍了中国人民正在贯彻毛主席关于斗、批、改、工人阶级必须领导一切、干部下放、教育革命、吸收工人阶级先进分子入党和清理阶级队伍等指示后说，在中国，正在开展一项对群众进行政治思想教育的极其巨大的工作。在那里，首先是开展学习毛泽东同志著作的极其伟大的工作。到处都在贯彻突出无产阶级政治的指示。剧目都是革命题材的。毛泽东思想宣传队已在各地组织起来，并进行着巨大的工作。
    查尔查尼同志高度评价了中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会。他说，这次全会彻底揭露了叛徒、工贼和帝国主义、国民党、修正主义的走狗刘少奇及其同伙；决定把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务；决定召开党的第九次全国代表大会。这次全会受到了全体劳动人民极其热烈的欢迎。
    查尔查尼同志指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利的伟大意义是无法估计的。这使在世界上占有如此重要地位的伟大的人民中国将永远是红彤彤的。这是社会主义和国际共产主义运动的莫大幸运。如果在反对中国修正主义代理人的这场生死攸关的斗争中没有毛泽东同志的英明领导，那就会出现一场巨大的灾难。这一胜利也是我们的胜利，因为人民中国是我们的伟大朋友，我们的伟大战友，是在任何情况下和一切方面援助和支持我们的诚挚的朋友。
    查尔查尼同志在谈到中国工农业方面所取得的辉煌成就后说，我们在中国的访问取得了胜利，在访问中到处体现了由我们两党、由恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志锤炼起来的阿尔巴尼亚和中国之间的永恒友谊。这是体现着相互援助的伟大的国际主义友谊。
    查尔查尼同志最后说，我们祝愿伟大的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得越来越大的成就，祝愿毛泽东同志长寿，万寿无疆！以造福于中国和整个世界革命。
    查尔查尼同志的报告不断被热烈的掌声和口号声所打断，到会群众多次起立，高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“友谊就是保证”、“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”、“毛泽东同志万岁！”
