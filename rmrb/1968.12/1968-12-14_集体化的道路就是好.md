After national liberation, with the completion of land reform, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, swiftly launched a magnificent wave of mutual aid and cooperation.

The tide of agricultural cooperativization struck fear into the hearts of a small handful of class enemies both at home and abroad. The agent of the exploiting classes who had infiltrated our Party, Liu Shaoqi, could not wait to jump out and fiercely oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He shouted that it was "impossible" for the countryside to take the road of collectivization. He viciously attacked the development of mutual aid and cooperation, and the gradual establishment of socialist production relations in the countryside, calling it a "wrong, dangerous, utopian agricultural socialism thought." Liu Shaoqi attempted to strangle the sprouts of the socialist collective economy and block the arrival of the socialist high tide in agriculture. He was extremely audacious!

What "utopian agricultural socialism thought"! Establishing cooperatives and taking the road of collectivization is the strong desire of the broad masses of peasants. As early as 1943, Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years it has been individual economy, one family one household is a production unit, this scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to what Lenin said, is through cooperatives." Chairman Mao's teachings spoke the heartfelt words of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have "enthusiasm for taking the socialist road," and they are the most resolute in taking the socialist road. The propaganda team where we are located in Jiubao Commune is an example. After land reform, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiubao Commune immediately responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "organize," established mutual aid teams, and achieved a great harvest in agriculture. Later, they established cooperatives, and in 1955, they achieved an even greater harvest than in the mutual aid team period. In 1957, relying on collective power, they overcame natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest. In 1958, after Chairman Mao's great call for "People's Communes are good," they immediately responded resolutely and established people's communes, advancing agricultural collectivization to a new stage. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiubao Commune, relying on the power of the collective economy, built a large-scale water reversal station on the banks of the Qiantang River, realizing the dream of electrified irrigation. The sandy soil that used to dry up and smoke after ten days without rain is now a fertile field. Whenever they talk about these great changes and developments, the poor and lower-middle peasants are very excited and say: "The road of collectivization guided by Chairman Mao is becoming wider and happier, it is the bright road to communism, we are determined to walk it!" The facts of the flourishing socialist cause in the countryside have long since thoroughly shattered Liu Shaoqi's shameful slander that establishing cooperatives is a "wrong, dangerous, utopian agricultural socialism thought."

What does Liu Shaoqi think is not "dangerous"? It is "preserving the rich peasant economy." He desperately shouted: "Hiring people to farm should not be restricted, 'it is also good for the poor.'" This is completely the howling of landlords, rich peasants, and bloodsuckers! From the facts of the development of the collective economy in Jiubao Commune, it can be seen that what is good for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants is only the road of collectivization. If Liu Shaoqi's plot to develop the rich peasant economy is allowed to succeed, then the phenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer will appear, making the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice and endure double hardship.

From this, it can be seen that Liu Shaoqi's opposition to agricultural cooperativization and advocacy for "preserving the rich peasant economy" is to develop capitalism in the countryside and realize the restoration of capitalism in our country.

In agriculture, whether to implement agricultural collectivization or develop the rich peasant economy, this is the focal point of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside, and it is a major issue of the first order that relates to whether to lead Chinese agriculture towards socialism or capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." Although the traitor Liu Shaoqi desperately opposes the socialist revolution, with the rolling forward of the wheels of history, the Party and the revolutionary people have forever thrown him into the garbage bin of history. We must continue to deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, thoroughly purge the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thought, and forever march forward along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    集体化的道路就是好
    解放军某部驻浙江余杭县九堡公社毛泽东思想宣传队
    全国解放以后，随着土地改革的完成，广大贫下中农在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，迅速掀起了轰轰烈烈的互助合作运动高潮。
    农业合作化的巨浪，使国内外一小撮阶级敌人吓破了胆。混进我们党内的剥削阶级代理人刘少奇，就迫不及待地跳出来，疯狂地反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他叫嚷什么农村走集体化的道路是“不可能的”。他恶毒地攻击发展互助合作运动、逐步建立农村的社会主义生产关系，是“一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想”。刘少奇妄想扼杀社会主义集体经济的萌芽，阻止农业社会主义高潮的到来。真是猖狂已极！
    什么“空想的农业社会主义思想”！办合作社，走集体化道路，是广大农民的强烈愿望。早在一九四三年，毛主席就深刻指出：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”毛主席的教导，句句说出了广大贫下中农的心里话。广大贫下中农有
  “走社会主义道路的积极性”，他们走社会主义的道路最坚决。我们宣传队所在的九堡公社就是一个例子。九堡公社广大贫下中农，在土改以后，立即响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，成立了互助组，夺取了农业大丰收。以后，又成立了合作社，一九五五年取得了比互助组时期更大的丰收。一九五七年，依靠集体力量，战胜了自然灾害，取得了特大丰收。一九五八年，毛主席“人民公社好”的伟大号召一发出，他们就坚决响应，立即成立了人民公社，使农业集体化跃进到了一个新阶段。九堡公社的贫下中农依靠集体经济的力量，在钱塘江边修建了大型翻水站，实现了灌溉电气化的愿望。过去十天不下雨就干得冒烟的沙土，现在成了一片丰收的良田。每当谈到这些巨大发展变化时，贫下中农都非常激动地说：“毛主席指引的集体化道路，越走越宽广，越走越幸福，是走向共产主义的光明大道，我们走定了！”农村社会主义事业繁荣兴旺的事实，早就彻底粉碎了刘少奇污蔑办合作社是“一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想”的无耻谰言。
    刘少奇认为不“危险”的是什么呢？那就是“保存富农经济”。他拚命叫嚷：雇人种地“不要限制”，“对穷人也是有好处的”。这完全是地主、富农、吸血鬼的嚎叫！从九堡公社集体经济发展的事实可以看出，对广大贫下中农有好处的，只能是走集体化的道路。如果让刘少奇发展富农经济的阴谋得逞，那么，就会出现富者越富、穷者越穷的现象，使贫下中农受二茬罪，吃二遍苦。
    由此可见，刘少奇反对农业合作化，鼓吹“保存富农经济”，其目的就是要在农村发展资本主义，在我国实现资本主义复辟。
    在农业方面，是实行农业集体化还是发展富农经济，这是农村中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的焦点，是关系着把中国农村引向社会主义还是引向资本主义的头等重大的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”尽管叛徒刘少奇拚命反对社会主义革命，但是随着历史车轮的滚滚前进，党和革命人民把他永远地扔进了历史的垃圾箱。我们要继续深入而持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想的流毒，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。
