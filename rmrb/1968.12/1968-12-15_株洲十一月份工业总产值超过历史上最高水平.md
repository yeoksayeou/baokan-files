Zhuzhou's industrial output in November exceeded the highest level in history. The revolutionary workers of Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously studied the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, and severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. By putting revolution in command of production, they achieved a significant increase in production. In November, the city's total industrial output exceeded the highest level in history.

In November, after sending a large number of excellent workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams and entering the superstructure to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the workers who remained in the factory bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. The industrial output increased by 15% compared to October, surpassing the month with the highest production level in history. The quality of many industrial products also significantly improved. The first-grade product rate of electrolytic copper and electrolytic lead reached 100%. The first-grade product rate of flat glass also increased to over 74%.

In the great struggle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the revolutionary workers severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "expert management" and "creeping philosophy" promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices. They firmly grasped the power of science and technology, fully unleashed the creative abilities of the working class. According to incomplete statistics, since this year, the city has implemented over 1,400 significant technological innovations and technological revolutions, successfully developed 250 new products, some of which have reached and even surpassed the world's advanced level.

Currently, the revolutionary workers of Zhuzhou City are striving to complete and exceed this year's production plan ahead of schedule while preparing for the new leap in industrial production next year. Most enterprises have formulated leap-forward plans for next year and are working hard to maintain equipment, prepare raw materials, and build new enterprises to ensure early production. They are determined to achieve outstanding results in the revolution and production to celebrate the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China!

    株洲十一月份工业总产值超过历史上最高水平
    湖南省株洲市广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，以革命统帅生产，使生产大幅度上升。十一月份，全市工业总产值超过了历史上的最高水平。
    十一月份，在派出大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻上层建筑领域领导斗、批、改后，留厂职工勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，工业总产值比十月份增加百分之十五，超过了历史上生产水平最高的月份。许多工业产品质量也大大提高。电铜、电铅等一级品率达到百分之百。平板玻璃一级品率也提高到百分之七十四以上。
    在斗、批、改的伟大斗争中，广大革命职工狠批了刘少奇及其同伙所推行的“专家治厂”、“爬行哲学”等反革命修正主义黑货，牢牢掌握了科学技术大权，充分发挥了工人阶级的创造才能。据不完全统计，今年以来，全市已实现较大的技术革新和技术革命一千四百多项，试制成功新产品二百五十种，其中有的项目和产品已达到和超过世界先进水平。
    目前，株洲市广大革命职工在力争提前完成和超额完成今年生产计划的同时，正在为明年工业生产的新飞跃作好一切准备。绝大部分企业已经制订了明年跃进规划，正在加紧搞好设备维修，准备原材料，新建企业也正在加紧施工，争取早日投入生产，用抓革命，促生产的优异成绩向党的“九大”献礼！
