The working class must lead everything. The workers of the Tianjin Cable Factory, following Chairman Mao's great directive, directly manage Yan'an Middle School and comprehensively lead the school's struggle, criticism, and reform. The practice of the past month has proven that the working class understands Chairman Mao's instructions most deeply and executes the proletarian revolutionary line most resolutely.

"The factory not only needs to produce good products for socialism but also to cultivate reliable revolutionary successors for the proletariat. This is our great mission." These few words are so well said! They embody the broad-mindedness of the working class. They have a far-reaching vision and are selfless, not just seeing the benefits of their own factory and the present, but looking at the benefits of the entire nation and the long term; they do not regard running a school as a burden, but see educating the next generation and ensuring the country's eternal color as their sacred duty; in leading the educational revolution, they always appear in the attitude of masters, actively and proactively, constantly creating experiences, and thus achieving good results.

Running a school is a new thing for the working class. In the face of new things, there will inevitably be some practical problems and various difficulties. However, as long as they follow Chairman Mao's instructions, fully mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses, they can not only run the school well but also continuously advance the revolution and production of the factory!

    伟大的使命
      “工人阶级必须领导一切”。天津电缆厂的工人阶级遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，直接管理延安中学，全面地领导学校的斗、批、改。一个月来的实践证明，工人阶级对毛主席的指示理解最深，执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最坚决。
      “工厂不仅要为社会主义出好产品，而且要为无产阶级培养可靠的革命接班人，这是我们的伟大使命。”这短短几句话说得何等好啊！它体现了工人阶级的广阔胸怀。他们高瞻远瞩，大公无私，不是只看到本厂的、眼前的利益，而是看到了全国的、长远的利益；他们没有把工厂办学校看成是自己的负担，而是把教育下一代，保证祖国永不变色，当作自己的神圣职责；他们在领导教育革命中，处处以主人翁的姿态出现，积极主动，不断创造经验，从而取得了很好的成绩。
    工厂办学校对工人阶级来说，是一件新生的事物。在新生事物面前，必然会遇到一些实际问题，碰到这样或那样的困难。但是只要象天津电缆厂的工人同志们那样，按照毛主席的指示去办，充分发动群众，依靠群众，不仅能够把学校办好，同时也能够把工厂的革命和生产不断推向前进！
