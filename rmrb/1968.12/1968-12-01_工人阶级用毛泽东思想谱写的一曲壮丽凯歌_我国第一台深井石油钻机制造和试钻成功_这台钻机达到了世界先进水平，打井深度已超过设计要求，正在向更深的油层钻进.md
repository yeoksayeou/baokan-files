The working class, using Mao Zedong Thought, has composed another magnificent victory song. The first domestically designed and manufactured deep-well oil drilling rig in China has recently succeeded in its trial drilling. Currently, the drilling depth of this rig has exceeded the design requirements and is continuing to drill into deeper oil layers. The successful manufacture and trial drilling of China's first deep-well oil drilling rig is a victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and another magnificent victory song composed by the working class using Mao Zedong Thought.

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." The first deep-well oil drilling rig in China was created by the broad masses of workers from the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory and dozens of related cooperating factories across the country, along with oil field workers and revolutionary technical personnel, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This great achievement shows that China is now fully capable of manufacturing a complete set of oil drilling machinery from shallow wells to deep wells, marking a significant leap forward in China's petroleum machinery industry. This has extremely important implications for further implementing Chairman Mao's policy of self-reliance and developing the petroleum industry more, faster, better, and more economically.

The successful birth of China's first deep-well oil drilling rig went through intense struggles between two classes, two lines, and two paths. The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents have long advocated the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, promoting the worship of foreign technology and opposing the self-reliant design and manufacture of deep-well drilling and extraction equipment in the production of petroleum machinery. The bourgeois technical "authorities" and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party sang the same tune. They believed that foreign countries had a century of history in manufacturing drilling rigs, while China had only a few years of experience, lacking the necessary expertise. They advocated copying and manufacturing according to foreign designs, following in the footsteps of foreigners. The workers in China's petroleum machinery manufacturing industry and the broad masses of petroleum workers adhered to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, following Mao Zedong's teachings: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they resisted and criticized the slavish mentality and crawling philosophy of the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents, breaking through various obstacles and impediments from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and bourgeois technical "authorities." They relied on their own efforts, striving for self-improvement, and began designing China's first deep-well drilling rig in 1965. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the drilling rig manufacturing workers resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," fighting against class enemies, erroneous thoughts, and various difficulties. In just over half a year, they manufactured the deep-well oil drilling rig. Trial drilling proved that China's drilling rig has reached the world's advanced level.

This deep-well oil drilling rig was designed and manufactured according to the actual needs of China's oil field development. The total weight of the rig is approximately 300 tons, driven by a diesel engine with a total power of 3,000 horsepower. The rig's single-machine weight is relatively light, making it easy to transport and move, suitable for China's mountainous and riverine mining areas. The rig has a high degree of mechanization and automation, good technical performance, providing favorable conditions for fast, multiple, and high-quality drilling, and can reduce the heavy physical labor of drilling workers, ensuring safe production. During the trial drilling process, this rig has passed through complex geological layers such as rock layers and "rubber layers," continuously traversing several high-pressure oil layers, undergoing rigorous tests, and has been warmly welcomed and praised by oil drilling workers.

Not long ago, the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory and the oil field drilling workers held a celebration meeting at the trial drilling site to commemorate the success of China's first deep-well oil drilling rig. The broad masses of workers, filled with the joy of victory, reviewed the great victory achieved by implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and had so much to say to Chairman Mao! They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They are determined to better grasp the revolution and promote production, achieving greater victories in revolution and production.

China's first domestically designed and manufactured deep-well oil drilling rig, which has reached the world's advanced level, has successfully completed its trial drilling. The image shows the mechanical workers who participated in the design and manufacture, along with the oil field drilling workers, filled with the joy of victory, holding a celebration meeting at the trial drilling site. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

    工人阶级用毛泽东思想谱写的一曲壮丽凯歌
    我国第一台深井石油钻机制造和试钻成功
    这台钻机达到了世界先进水平，打井深度已超过设计要求，正在向更深的油层钻进
    新华社兰州二十九日电　我国自行设计、自行制造的第一台具有世界先进水平的深井石油钻机，最近在油田试钻成功。目前这台钻机打井深度已超过设计要求，正在向更深的油层钻进。我国第一台深井石油钻机的制造和试钻成功，是毛主席革命路线的一个胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的一个光辉成果，是工人阶级用毛泽东思想谱写的又一曲壮丽凯歌。
    “无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”我国第一台深井石油钻机，是兰州石油化工机器厂及全国几十个有关协作工厂的广大工人和油田工人，同革命的技术人员一道，在无产阶级文化大革命中创造出来的。这一巨大成就，表明我国已经完全能够制造从浅井到深井的全套石油钻井机械，标志着我国石油机械工业提高到了一个崭新的水平，对我国进一步贯彻执行毛主席的自力更生方针，更多更快更好更省地发展石油工业，有着极为重要的意义。
    我国第一台深井石油钻机的胜利诞生，经历了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人长期以来竭力推行反革命修正主义路线，在制造石油机械方面，鼓吹崇洋仿外，反对自力更生地设计制造深井钻采设备。资产阶级技术“权威”和党内一小撮走资派唱一个调子。他们认为外国制造钻机的历史已有一个世纪，而我国制造钻机才不过几年，没有经验，主张照外国的抄，照外国的造，跟在外国人后面爬行。我国石油机械制造工人和广大石油工人坚持毛主席的革命路线，遵照毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，抵制和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇及其代理人的洋奴思想和爬行哲学，冲破了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的种种刁难、阻挠，自力更生，奋发图强，从一九六五年开始设计我国第一台深井钻机。在无产阶级文化大革命中，钻机制造工人坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，同阶级敌人斗，同错误思想斗，同各种困难斗，只用半年多的时间就把深井石油钻机制造了出来。经过试钻证明，我国这台钻机达到了世界先进水平。
    这台深井石油钻机是根据我国开发油田的实际需要设计、制造的。全机总重量约三百吨，由总功率为三千马力的柴油机带动。钻机的单机重量较轻，便于运载移动，适用于我国多山河矿区。这台钻机机械化、自动化程度高，技术性能好，为快打井、多打井、打好井提供了有利条件，而且可以减轻钻井工人繁重的体力劳动，保证安全生产。在试钻过程中，这台钻机已通过岩石层、“橡皮层”等复杂的地层，连续穿越了几个高压油层，经过了严格的考验，它受到了石油钻井工人热烈的欢迎和好评。
    不久以前，兰州石油化工机器厂和试钻的油田钻井工人，在试钻现场举行了我国第一台深井石油钻机试钻成功庆祝大会。广大工人带着胜利的喜悦，回顾贯彻执行毛主席革命路线所取得的这一巨大胜利的战斗历程，有多少贴心的话要对毛主席讲啊！他们一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”决心更好地抓革命，促生产，在革命和生产上夺取更大的胜利。（附图片）
