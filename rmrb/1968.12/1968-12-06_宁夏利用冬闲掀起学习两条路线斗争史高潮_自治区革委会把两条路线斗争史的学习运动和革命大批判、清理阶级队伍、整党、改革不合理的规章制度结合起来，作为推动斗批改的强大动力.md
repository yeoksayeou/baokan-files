In the course of fully implementing the various great battle tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with the latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao that "historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," seized the winter agricultural off-season to launch a mass movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party in the entire rural area, determined to push the rural struggle, criticism, and transformation to a new high tide.

After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Ningxia's rural areas have undergone earth-shaking changes. The Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee timely analyzed and studied the new trends in rural class struggle, recognizing that in the new situation, it is necessary to strengthen education on the history of the struggle between the two lines, constantly raise the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, in order to overcome the possible complacency and relaxation of vigilance in the face of a good situation, and to carry the rural cultural revolution to the end.

After the publication of the full text of the Plenum, the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, except for leaving one standing committee member to handle daily work, sent all other leading members to the grassroots level. The leading members of the county and city revolutionary committees also rushed to the front line of class struggle. Under their leadership, a propaganda army composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA leftist support personnel, and revolutionary cadres quickly formed in the entire rural area, basically achieving the goal of having a propaganda team in each commune, a propaganda group in each production brigade, and a propagandist in each production team. In the past month, tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held in the rural areas of the entire region. In these study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, in connection with the actual struggle between the two lines in their own communes and brigades, reviewed Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions in various major historical periods of the socialist revolution in the countryside, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's series of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread in the countryside, and further ignited their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and their deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. They said: "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our poor and lower-middle peasants' lifeline and happiness line; Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line is the lifeline and restoration line of the landlords and bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will talk about it every day, every month, every year, and pass it down to future generations; Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line, we will criticize it every day, every month, every year, and criticize it until it stinks for ten thousand years."

In the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee guided the masses to closely combine the study movement with the current ongoing revolutionary criticism, class lineup rectification, party rectification, and reform of unreasonable regulations and systems, and to use the study movement as a powerful driving force for the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Some production brigades overcame the thoughts of complacency and relaxation, and the revolutionary criticism combined with the class lineup rectification work quickly appeared in a new high tide.

In the reform of unreasonable regulations and systems, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "work points as the commander" and "material incentives" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. Through the criticism, the community members raised the elimination of private interests to the height of the struggle between the two lines, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of the people. At present, the Dazhai-style political work-point assessment system has been implemented in most communes and brigades in the entire region. Some advanced production brigades have even begun to implement the "proletarian political command, self-report according to needs" grain distribution system.

The Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, in order to carry out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines more extensively and deeply, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses," timely summarized and promoted the advanced experiences of the masses. At present, the entire region is taking advanced units as examples, finding gaps, and seriously formulating measures to further carry out revolutionary criticism and to learn the history of the struggle between the two lines in the criticism. They are determined to push the struggle, criticism, and transformation to a new high tide this winter and next spring.

    宁夏利用冬闲掀起学习两条路线斗争史高潮
    自治区革委会把两条路线斗争史的学习运动和革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党、改革不合理的规章制度结合起来，作为推动斗批改的强大动力
    据新华社银川五日电　在全面落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务中，宁夏回族自治区革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，抓住冬季农闲时机，在全区农村掀起了一个学习党内两条路线斗争史的群众运动，决心把农村斗、批、改推向新的高潮。
    经过两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，宁夏农村发生了天翻地覆的变化。自治区革委会及时分析研究了农村阶级斗争的新动向，认识到，在新的形势下，必须加强两条路线斗争史的教育，不断提高广大贫下中农和社员群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，才能克服在大好形势下可能产生的麻痹松劲情绪，把农村文化大革命进行到底。
    全会公报发表后，自治区革委会除留一名常委处理日常工作外，其他领导成员全部深入基层，各县、市革委会领导成员也纷纷下到阶级斗争第一线。在他们的带动下，全区农村迅速组成了一支有贫下中农、解放军支左人员、革命干部参加的宣传大军，基本上做到了公社有宣传队，大队有宣传组，生产队有宣传员。一个月来，全区农村办起了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，广大贫下中农联系本社本队的两条路线斗争实际，重温了毛主席在农村社会主义革命各个重大历史时期所作的光辉指示，狠批刘少奇在农村散布的一系列反革命修正主义谬论，更加激发了他们对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚，对刘少奇资产阶级反动路线的无比仇恨。他们说：“毛主席的革命路线是我们贫下中农的生命线、幸福线；刘少奇的反动路线，是地主、资产阶级的保命线、复辟线。毛主席的革命路线，我们要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，子子孙孙往下传；刘少奇的反动路线，我们要天天批，月月批，年年批，批得它遗臭万年。”
    在两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，自治区革委会引导群众把学习运动和当前正在进行的革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党、改革不合理的规章制度紧密结合起来，把学习运动作为推动斗、批、改的强大动力。一些大队麻痹松劲的思想克服了，革命大批判结合着清理阶级队伍工作又迅速出现新高潮。
    在改革不合理的规章制度中，广大贫下中农狠批了刘少奇的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。通过大批判，广大社员把破私立公提到了两条路线斗争的高度，大大促进了人的思想革命化。目前，大寨式的政治评工记分制度已在全区大多数社队实行，一些先进的生产大队，还开始实行“无产阶级政治挂帅，按需自报”的口粮分配制度。
    自治区革委会为了把两条路线斗争史的学习运动开展得更加广泛深入，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，及时总结推广群众中的先进经验，目前，全区以先进单位为榜样，大找差距，认真制定进一步开展革命大批判、在大批判中学习两条路线斗争史的措施，决心在今冬明春把斗、批、改推向新高潮。
