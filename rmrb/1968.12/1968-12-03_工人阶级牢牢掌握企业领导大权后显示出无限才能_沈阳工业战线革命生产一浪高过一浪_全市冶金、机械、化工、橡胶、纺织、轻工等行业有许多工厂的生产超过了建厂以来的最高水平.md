In the great tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the workers of Shenyang have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and achieved one splendid victory after another in both revolution and production.

Since the beginning of this year, the industrial front in Shenyang has seen a continuously improving revolutionary situation and surging production. Building on the dual victories of revolution and production in the first half of the year, the production level in the third quarter has been further raised. After sending a large number of outstanding workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure, the workers who remained in the factories bravely shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, raising the production level to a new height. In many factories across the city in the metallurgy, machinery, chemical, rubber, textile, and light industries, production has exceeded the highest levels since the factories were established. Entering November, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the industrial production situation in Shenyang has become even better, with both the quantity and quality of various products significantly increasing.

The excellent situation of revolution and production on the industrial front in Shenyang is the result of the working class firmly grasping the leadership of enterprises, persistently studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously emphasizing proletarian politics. For a long time, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shenyang have frantically promoted a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "expert management," "technology first," "production first," and "material incentives." They resisted the broad revolutionary masses from studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and used methods of control, restriction, oppression, and punishment to shackle the workers' hands and feet, obstructing the development of productive forces. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses raised the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, seizing back the leadership of the factories and enterprises. The broad revolutionary masses studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought even more eagerly. They established Mao Zedong Thought study classes and held meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They praised Chairman Mao's great wisdom, celebrated the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, deeply exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in attempting to restore capitalism, further raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and igniting their revolutionary enthusiasm for production. The Shenyang Paper Mill has reduced its workforce by a quarter this year compared to last year, but the production tasks have increased compared to last year. Facing difficulties, the workers have mustered their strength and increased the daily paper production from eight tons to thirteen tons, and successfully trial-produced a type of drum liner paper urgently needed by the state using simple equipment. The cargo handling volume of the Shenyang Railway Bureau has exceeded the plan every month since this year. In October, the workers overcame a series of difficulties and created a new level, with the cargo loading and unloading volumes exceeding the highest levels of 1966. The Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory, which specializes in producing machine tools, failed to produce an "advanced machine tool" before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, despite four years of effort by a group of bourgeois technical "authorities," wasting over 200,000 yuan of state funds. Now, the workers have established a three-in-one experimental group and, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and their own hands, successfully trial-produced the machine tool in less than a year. The speed and quality are unprecedented in the history of machine tool manufacturing.

Many revolutionary workers in factories and enterprises have fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's promotion of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "expert management" and "crawling policy," breaking free from foreign frameworks, and are leading a mass technical innovation and technological revolution, producing a large number of new processes, new technologies, and new products, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of production. The revolutionary masses have further carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, saving the state a large amount of wealth. The Shenyang Glass Container Factory needs a coal gas generator for production. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party advocated asking the state for money and equipment to build a large, foreign one. This year, the workers carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, using local methods to quickly build a coal gas generator for only 2,000 yuan, meeting the production needs.

Since the beginning of this year, the revolutionary workers in various factories and enterprises have strengthened cooperation, supported each other, and jointly completed many important production tasks. When the Shenyang Electroplating Factory took on an important production task, it urgently needed an air compressor. Upon hearing this, the revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Air Compressor Parts Factory worked overnight to assemble one and sent it to the Electroplating Factory, strongly supporting its production.

    工人阶级牢牢掌握企业领导大权后显示出无限才能
    沈阳工业战线革命生产一浪高过一浪
    全市冶金、机械、化工、橡胶、纺织、轻工等行业有许多工厂的生产超过了建厂以来的最高水平
    新华社沈阳一日电　在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，沈阳工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，活学活用毛泽东思想，在抓革命、促生产中取得一个又一个辉煌的胜利。
    今年以来，沈阳工业战线的革命形势越来越好，生产一浪高过一浪。全市广大革命职工在取得上半年革命、生产双胜利的基础上，第三季度的生产水平又有提高。各工厂在十月份派出大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑领域领导斗、批、改后，留厂职工勇挑革命、生产两副重担，又把生产水平提高到一个新的高度。全市冶金、机械、化工、橡胶、纺织、轻工等行业有许多工厂的生产超过了建厂以来的最高水平。进入十一月份，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，沈阳工业生产形势更加大好，各项产品产量和质量又大幅度上升。
    沈阳工业战线出现的革命、生产的大好形势，是全市工人阶级牢牢掌握企业领导大权后，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，大力突出无产阶级政治的结果。长期以来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在沈阳的代理人，疯狂推行“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“生产第一”、“物质刺激”等一整套反革命修正主义黑货，抵制广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，还用管、卡、压、罚等办法束缚工人手脚，阻止生产力的发展。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，造了党内一小撮走资派的反，夺回了工厂企业的领导大权，广大革命职工更加如饥似渴地活学活用毛泽东思想。他们大办毛泽东思想学习班，举办活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，颂扬毛主席的英明伟大，赞颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，深揭狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，激发了搞好生产的革命干劲。沈阳市人民造纸厂今年人员比去年减少四分之一，而生产任务比去年还有增加。在困难面前，广大职工鼓足干劲，把纸的日产量由八吨提高到十三吨，并用简陋的设备试制成功一种国家急需的缸垫纸。沈阳铁路局的货物装卸量，今年以来月月超额完成计划。十月份，广大职工克服了一系列困难，又创造了新的水平，货物装车量和卸车量，分别超过一九六六年的最高水平。专门生产机床的沈阳第二机床厂，在无产阶级文化大革命以前，一些资产阶级技术“权威”想搞一台“先进机床”，整整搞了四年都没有成功，浪费国家资金二十多万元。现在，工人自己成立了三结合试验小组，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，凭着一双手，不到一年的时间就试制成功了。速度之快，质量之高，是机床制造史上空前未有的。
    许多工厂企业的革命职工，狠批刘少奇推行的“专家治厂”、“爬行主义”等反革命修正主义黑货，冲破洋框框，正在兴起一个群众性的技术革新和技术革命高潮，出现了大量的新工艺、新技术、新产品，有力地推动了生产的高速度发展。广大革命职工还进一步发扬自力更生的精神，为国家节约了大量财富。沈阳市玻璃容器厂生产上需要一座煤气发生炉。过去，党内一小撮走资派主张向国家要钱，要设备，修大的、洋的。今年工人们发扬自力更生的精神，土法上马，只花了两千元就建成一座煤气发生炉，满足了生产需要。
    今年以来，各工厂企业广大革命职工，加强协作，互相支援，共同完成了许多重点产品的生产任务。沈阳电镀厂承担一项重要生产任务时，急需一台空气压缩机，沈阳空气压缩机配件厂的革命职工听说后，连夜装配成一台送到电镀厂，有力地支援了电镀厂的生产。
