The revolutionary workers on the power industry frontline have vigorously emphasized proletarian politics and achieved remarkable results in coal-saving and electricity-saving, accumulating rich experience and effectively promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, December 13th: Under the glorious directives of Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production" and "Save coal and electricity to make revolution," the revolutionary workers on China's power industry frontline have made remarkable achievements in power generation and supply this year. They have also made significant progress in reducing coal consumption, saving electricity, and adjusting loads, effectively promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Recently, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power held a national conference on the power industry's "Grasp revolution, promote production, save coal and electricity" in Shijiazhuang City. The conference exchanged experiences in this regard.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Economy is one of the basic principles of socialist economy." The revolutionary workers on the power industry frontline have severely criticized the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, raising their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. With great enthusiasm for socialist construction, they proudly declared: "Saving one kilowatt-hour of electricity and one gram of coal is like offering one more bit of loyalty to Chairman Mao, adding one more bit of strength to the revolution." They actively brainstormed and found ways to carry out technological innovations and technological revolutions, achieving outstanding results in coal-saving and electricity-saving. The revolutionary workers of Liaoyuan Power Plant implemented several major technological innovations, opening up new paths for reducing coal consumption and saving electricity. The revolutionary workers of Tangshan Power Plant, under the battle cry of "Save coal for the revolution," successfully burned more than 200,000 tons of coal gangue in just five months, saving more than 70,000 tons of good coal, while ensuring safe power generation. The revolutionary workers of the Shijiazhuang power system, Beijing Power Supply Bureau, and Luzhong Power System held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously emphasizing proletarian politics, achieving results in coal-saving and electricity-saving, and accumulating rich experience.

The revolutionary workers on the power industry frontline also spared no effort to tap the potential of existing equipment, did a good job in equipment maintenance, and strove to generate and supply more electricity, ensuring uninterrupted power supply to various sectors of the national economy. The revolutionary workers of Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant, Wujing Thermal Power Plant, and Yangshupu Power Plant dared to think, dared to do, and dared to make revolution. They broke through foreign frameworks and old regulations, creating experiences of overloaded equipment operation. The revolutionary workers of Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant blazed a new trail in innovating steam turbine generators and boilers. The plant fully relied on the worker masses, with workers proposing plans, designing, and collectively improving, significantly increasing the output of a boiler. The entire plant increased power generation without adding new equipment.

    遵循毛主席“要节约闹革命”的光辉指示
    水利电力部召开省煤节电现场会
    电力工业战线广大革命职工，大力突出无产阶级政治，在省煤节电等方面做出显著成绩，积累了丰富经验，有力地促进了工农业生产发展
    新华社石家庄十三日电我国电力工业战线广大革命职工，在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的光辉指示指引下，今年以来，不但在发电供电方面做出显著成绩，而且在减少煤炭消耗、节约电力、调整负荷等方面也取得了很大成绩，有力地促进了工农业生产的发展。
    最近，水利电力部在石家庄市召开全国电力工业抓革命、促生产，省煤节电现场会议，交流了这方面的经验。
    毛主席教导我们：“节约是社会主义经济的基本原则之一。”电力工业战线的广大革命职工狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。工人们怀着对社会主义建设的满腔热情，豪迈地提出：“多节约一度电，一克煤，就是多向毛主席敬献一分忠心，就是为革命多增添一分力量。”他们自觉地开动脑筋，寻找办法，大搞技术革新和技术革命，在省煤节电方面创造了优异的成绩。辽源发电厂的革命职工，实现了多项重大的技术革新，为减少煤炭消耗和节约电力开创了新的途径。唐山发电厂的革命职工，在“为革命而节约煤炭”的战斗口号下，在短短五个月内，成功地燃烧矸石煤二十多万吨，节约好煤七万多吨，同时保证了安全发电。石家庄地区电业系统、北京供电局、鲁中电业系统革命职工举办毛泽东思想学习班，大力突出无产阶级政治，在省煤节电方面做出了成绩，并积累了丰富经验。
    电力工业战线广大革命职工还千方百计地挖掘现有设备潜力，做好设备检修工作，力争多发电多供电，保证向国民经济各部门不间断地供应电力。石家庄热电厂、吴泾热电厂、杨树浦发电厂等单位的革命职工，发扬敢想、敢干、敢革命的精神，破除洋框框和旧的规章制度，创造了设备超出力运行的经验。石家庄热电厂革命职工在革新汽轮发电机和锅炉方面闯出了一条新路子。这个厂充分依靠工人群众，由工人提方案，工人搞设计，群策群力进行改进，把一个锅炉的出力大大提高。全厂在不增添设备的情况下提高了发电量。
