Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Baotou Steel Corporation Revolutionary Committee and the broad revolutionary masses of workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-left personnel, have focused on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly cleaned up the class ranks, and achieved dual victories in revolution and production. Over the past year, the steel and iron output of this corporation has continued to rise. Iron ore, coke, iron ingots, limestone, refractory bricks, and other important products have all been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the production targets.

The Baotou Steel Revolutionary Committee and the broad revolutionary masses of workers, following Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, have extensively and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism with a focus on class struggle. They have launched a fierce attack on a handful of capitalist roaders within the Baotou Steel Party and other counter-revolutionary elements, thoroughly smashing the evil plot of a handful of class enemies who attempted to restore capitalism in Baotou Steel. Through revolutionary criticism, they have thoroughly established Chairman Mao's personally endorsed "Anshan Constitution," implemented proletarian political leadership, greatly promoted the thought revolution of the people, and promoted continuous leaps in production. Under the great encouragement of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's public report, the broad revolutionary masses of workers have seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, pushing the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and continuously deepening the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In the struggle to seize revolution and promote production, the broad revolutionary masses of workers at Baotou Steel have actively carried out technological revolution and technological innovation activities, achieving outstanding results. By mid-December, the various factories and mines had implemented more than 240 technological innovation projects, some of which have reached international advanced levels. The workers at the Baotou Steel Inspection Factory boldly improved the installation of the hot blast stove thermocouple in the blast furnace, increasing the service life of the thermocouple by seven times compared to the past and by twenty-eight times compared to the original design, saving more than 130,000 yuan annually compared to the original design.

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下
    包钢革命生产双胜利
    据新华社呼和浩特二十六日电　包头钢铁公司革命委员会和广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，深入开展革命大批判，认真清理阶级队伍，获得了革命和生产的双胜利。一年来，这个公司的钢铁产量不断上升，铁矿石、焦炭、铁坯、石灰石、耐火砖和其他一些重要产品，都提前超额完成了生产任务。
    包钢革委会和广大革命职工，遵循毛主席无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，大办以狠抓阶级斗争为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，广泛深入地开展革命大批判，向包钢党内一小撮走资派以及其他反革命分子发动了猛烈进攻，彻底粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄想在包钢复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。通过革命的大批判，大立毛主席亲自批示的“鞍钢宪法”，实行无产阶级政治挂帅，大大促进了人的思想革命化，促进了生产的不断跃进，在毛主席的“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示和党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，广大革命职工认真学习两条路线的斗争史，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向了一个新的阶段，斗、批、改不断深入。
    在抓革命促生产的斗争中，包钢广大革命职工积极开展技术革命和技术革新活动，取得了出色成就。到十二月上旬，各厂矿已经实现的技术革新项目有二百四十多项，其中有的达到了国际先进水平。包钢动检厂工人大胆改进高炉热风炉热电偶的安装，使热电偶使用寿命比过去提高七倍，比原设计提高二十八倍，每年比原设计节省资金十三万多元。
