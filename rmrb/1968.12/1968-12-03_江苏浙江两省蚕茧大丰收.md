Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," Jiangsu Province, an important silkworm cocoon production area in our country, achieved a total silkworm cocoon production this year that was 40 percent higher than the bumper harvest of last year, setting a new record for the highest production in the 19 years since liberation. Among them, the old silkworm area of Suzhou Prefecture increased production by 50 percent compared to last year, and the new silkworm areas of Yangzhou, Nantong, and other prefectures also had significant increases. The quality of the silkworm cocoons was generally better than last year. Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the silkworm areas are sending the bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons to the state procurement stations in a continuous stream.

This spring, the regions of Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Sixi, and Xuhuai experienced droughts, and the old silkworm areas of Suzhou and Zhenjiang did not see rain for over a month, causing the mulberry trees to grow slowly. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with a red heart for revolution and silkworm rearing, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "carrying forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous battle (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," launched fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies while tenaciously fighting against natural disasters. They finally overcame the natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons.

Zhejiang Province, another major silkworm cocoon production area in our country, also achieved a bumper harvest. The broad masses of commune members, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, eagerly delivered silkworm cocoons to the state. By November 20, the province not only exceeded the annual procurement plan for silkworm cocoons but also set a new record for the highest procurement of silkworm cocoons since liberation. The quality of the silkworm cocoons was also better than in previous years.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the silkworm areas of Zhejiang, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried out extensive and in-depth criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, greatly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They further established the idea of planting good mulberry trees and raising good silkworms for the revolution. In the Tianmu Mountain area and the western Zhejiang mountain area, new silkworm areas such as Quzhou and Fuyang, the broad masses of commune members carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, making full use of the hills and slopes and river beaches and sandbars, adopting methods such as opening mountains and leveling land, and carrying soil to create land, doing everything possible to expand the mulberry gardens and develop the silkworm industry. In the old silkworm areas of the Hangjiahu Plain, such as Tongxiang, Deqing, Wuxing, and Haining counties, they fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the people, overcame difficulties such as low temperatures, and achieved a bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons.

After achieving the bumper harvest, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with a heart full of gratitude to Chairman Mao, eagerly delivered patriotic cocoons to the state, thus greatly accelerating the progress of silkworm cocoon procurement in the province and significantly improving the quality.

    江苏浙江两省蚕茧大丰收
    在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指引下，我国重要蚕茧产区江苏省，今年蚕茧总产量比大丰收的去年增产百分之四十，创造了解放十九年来的最高纪录。其中，老蚕区苏州专区比去年增产百分之五十，新蚕区扬州、南通等专区增产的幅度也很大。蚕茧质量普遍好于去年。目前，蚕区的广大贫下中农正把丰收的蚕茧源源不断地送往国家收购站。
    今年春季，镇江、扬州、六合山区和徐淮等地区发生干旱，老蚕区苏州、镇江等地一个多月没有下雨，桑树生长缓慢。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，怀着一颗为革命种桑养蚕的红心，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，一面向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，一面顽强地同自然灾害展开英勇的搏斗，终于战胜了自然灾害，夺得了蚕茧的特大丰收。
    我国主要蚕茧产区浙江省获得蚕茧大丰收。广大社员满怀革命豪情，踊跃向国家交售蚕茧，到十一月二十日，全省不但超额完成了全年蚕茧收购计划，而且创造了解放以来收购蚕茧的最高纪录。蚕茧质量也较往年好。
    浙江蚕区广大贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，广泛深入地开展了对于叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，进一步树立了为革命栽好桑、养好蚕的思想。天目山区、浙西山区的衢县、富阳等新蚕区，广大社员发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，充分利用丘陵山坡和溪滩沙洲，采取开山整地和挑土造地等办法，千方百计扩种桑园，发展养蚕事业。杭嘉湖平原老蚕区桐乡、德清、吴兴、海宁等县，充分发挥人的积极因素，克服了低温等困难，夺取了蚕茧大丰收。
    在获得大丰收后，广大贫下中农怀着丰收不忘毛主席的一片忠心，纷纷踊跃向国家交售爱国茧，因而全省蚕茧收购工作的进度大大加快，质量也显著提高。
