The Nanxi Agricultural Middle School in Taiping Commune, Nanping City, Fujian Province, is a school founded and directly managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Since its establishment in March 1958, this school has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian educational policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," cultivating a batch of "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers." The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "The students trained by the agricultural middle school can all write (propagate Mao Zedong Thought), calculate (manage socialist collective economy), and work for socialism (understand class struggle, understand scientific experiments, and love collective labor). With such successors, we can rest assured!"

Nanxi Agricultural Middle School has grown and consolidated in the stormy waves of class struggle. Nanxi Production Brigade has 295 households and 1,327 people. Before liberation, the cultural level was extremely backward, and 98% of the poor and lower-middle peasants were illiterate. After liberation, they stood up politically and had an urgent need to learn culture. However, due to Liu Shaoqi's implementation of the revisionist educational line, it was extremely difficult for the children of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to attend middle school. From 1950 to 1957, this brigade had 62 graduates from primary school, but only 13 were admitted to middle school, of which only 5 were children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Due to high school fees, the annual expenses for one student amounted to over 160 yuan, which was more than two-thirds of a laborer's annual income. The poor and lower-middle peasants could not afford it, and some students who had been admitted had to drop out. At the same time, the poor and lower-middle peasants also saw that their children, after going to the city, changed their thoughts and lives every day. When they returned home for holidays, they were afraid of dirt, afraid of hard work, liked to eat well, and liked to dress well. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very dissatisfied. They decided to establish a school at their doorstep that could serve the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In March 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanxi Production Brigade established the agricultural middle school.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns." After the establishment of Nanxi Agricultural Middle School, the class enemies and old forces in society criticized Nanxi Agricultural Middle School as "neither fish nor fowl," not like a private school, not like a regular school, and not like a production team. At this time, some people wavered, and some students did not come to school. Could the poor and lower-middle peasants run a school? Could they run the school well? In the severe class struggle, the old poor peasant Ou Kuiying stood up and encouraged everyone, saying: "We poor and lower-middle peasants running a school is a pioneering thing. Since ancient times, landlords have taught their children to collect rent, and we poor and lower-middle peasants running a school, the children we train must be able to read, write, and love labor. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to run the school well." Through patient ideological work, the number of students increased from a dozen to over thirty. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the commune party tried to seize the cultural power from the poor and lower-middle peasants by means of adjustment, merger, and dismantling, intending to transfer Nanxi Agricultural Middle School to the commune for management, following the ordinary middle school path of detachment from reality and labor. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw this with their own eyes and felt pain in their hearts. They resolutely opposed this practice and insisted on running the school according to Chairman Mao's instructions, with the poor and lower-middle peasants directly managing this agricultural middle school.

The bourgeois educational line did not crush this middle school run by the poor and lower-middle peasants, so they resorted to "pulling" tactics. They raised the banner of supporting agricultural middle schools and used materials as bait, sending Nanxi Agricultural Middle School experimental instruments worth over 2,900 yuan. Among these instruments, in addition to a small number of microscopes, soil testing boxes, balances, and hygrometers, a large number were materials unrelated to the teaching of the agricultural middle school. This raised a question: should the teaching be arranged according to these instruments, or should the experiment continue to serve teaching and production based on rural realities? This is a question of whether the agricultural middle school should change its educational direction. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanxi Production Brigade said: "We want our children to practice real skills in collective production. If they stay in the room learning foreign codes, they will become bookworms." They kept some of the truly useful instruments according to the needs of teaching and handed them over to the teachers for teaching and guidance, while the rest were kept intact. Now, these useless "foreign instruments" have become live targets for students to criticize the bourgeois educational line.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview." The reactionary feudal remnants and spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside also infiltrate the school through various channels, attempting to seize the young generation in the countryside. In 1963, when the first batch of agricultural middle school students were about to graduate, the reactionary feudal clan heads jumped out, repaired ancestral halls, built temples, raised funds, and held ancestral worship activities, trying to lead the graduating students to worship the ancestors, causing the village to be filled with smoke and stench. The bitter and resentful old poor peasants were very angry and told the agricultural middle school students: "Who gave us our good days today? It was Chairman Mao. Who gave you the opportunity to study today? It was Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao let the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants all have the opportunity to study. For what? To build socialism. The clan head leads the ancestral worship, wanting us to return to the old society to be oppressed again. You have studied, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and do not be misled by evil ways." Under the guidance of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the students of the agricultural middle school refused to participate in the ancestral worship. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary teachers and students followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," smashed the ancestral tablets and big and small idols in the ancestral halls, exposed the plots of the feudal clan heads, and exposed a group of long-hidden counter-revolutionaries, which was greatly welcomed by the people.

The practice of Nanxi Agricultural Middle School growing and consolidating in the complex and sharp class struggle tells us: cultural power is also related to the thousand-year plan of building socialism in the countryside. In the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants who have suffered deeply have the highest political awareness, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and implement Chairman Mao's instructions the most resolutely. They are the masters of rural culture, and the cultural power in the countryside should be firmly in their hands.

Practice has proven that the poor and lower-middle peasants can definitely run the school well. In recent years, Nanxi Agricultural Middle School has carried out some reforms. It has the following characteristics:

1. Emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, placing political and ideological education for students in the first place. They took the People's Liberation Army as an example, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's works. In early 1965, according to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they merged the Chinese language course with the political course, allowing students to have more time to study Chairman Mao's works. From then on, the first lesson of each semester was "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

2. The production brigade selected poor and lower-middle peasants with deep bitterness and high political awareness to form the school management committee, responsible for the school's leadership work. The admission of students was politically vetted by the poor and lower-middle peasants, with over 90% of the students being children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Under the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the school's teaching started from production practice, compiled textbooks, learned for use, and combined learning with application.

3. To facilitate the admission of children of poor and lower-middle peasants, the school also set up preparatory classes. Thus, children of poor and lower-middle peasants with a third or fourth-grade education could also enter the agricultural middle school to study. Since 1964, the school's examination system has been changed to evaluate based on the results of practical operations, supplemented by written tests, and the retention system has been abolished.

4. Fewer and more focused courses, paying attention to the use of local teaching materials. The Chinese language course emphasizes rural application files. In addition to basic courses, mathematics focuses on accounting ledgers, land measurement, and yield estimation compiled by the municipal accounting guidance station, making the teaching materials updated every semester, and students can use the new knowledge they learn immediately.

5. Self-reliance and making do with what is available. The school desks, chairs, and blackboards were made by the students. The students brought not the old "three treasures" (brush, ink, and inkstone) but the new "three treasures" (Chairman Mao's works, hoe, and shoulder pole) when they entered the school. The poor and lower-middle peasants had strict requirements for students' participation in productive labor. In addition to organizing students to participate in school experimental bases and brigade production labor, the school also signed a young forest tending contract with the local state-owned forest farm. The labor income solved many of the school's expenses, and students did not have to pay for their studies. The poor and lower-middle peasants said that such a school had many advantages, reddening thoughts, learning culture, tempering the body, and maintaining the character of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

6. The school set up a free veterinary station, agricultural technology station, and accounting guidance station. The knowledge students learned could immediately serve the collective production of the brigade. The veterinary clinic set up by this school has cured over 80 cases of sick cattle and over 500 cases of sick pigs in recent years. During the treatment, teachers and students went to the scene together, diagnosed, prescribed, and injected together. Once, a cow in the ninth production team fell ill suddenly. The school immediately organized a team of teachers, students, and old peasants to go to the scene for diagnosis and treatment, and finally cured the cow. The poor and lower-middle peasants reflected: "The people from our agricultural middle school are all real talents, able to speak and do." This agricultural middle school also provided the brigade with excellent varieties cultivated in its experimental fields. At the end of each year, the school organized senior students to go to various production teams to help with the settlement of accounts.

7. Having a deep mass foundation. The poor and lower-middle peasants clearly saw that the students trained by the agricultural middle school had high political awareness, loved labor, and returned to the team as a full labor force, forming a sharp contrast with ordinary middle school students. The poor and lower-middle peasants felt even more that the agricultural middle school was well-run and satisfactory, so their enthusiasm for running the school was even higher, and they were all willing to send their children to the agricultural middle school.

    贫下中农掌管文权就是好！
    福建省南平市太平公社南溪农业中学调查报告
    福建省南平市太平公社南溪农业中学，是由贫下中农亲手创办、直接管理的学校。从一九五八年三月办学以来，这所学校坚决执行毛主席制定的“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的无产阶级教育方针，培养出一批“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。贫下中农说：“农中培养的学生，个个会写（宣传毛泽东思想）、会算（管理社会主义集体经济）、会干社会主义（懂得阶级斗争，懂得科学实验，又热爱集体劳动）。有这样的接班人我们就放心啦！”
    南溪农中是在阶级斗争大风大浪中成长、巩固的。南溪大队共有二百九十五户，一千三百二十七人。解放前，文化非常落后，贫下中农百分之九十八是文盲。解放后，他们政治上翻了身，学习文化的要求非常迫切。但是，由于刘少奇推行了修正主义教育路线，使广大贫下中农的子女上中学困难重重。一九五○年到一九五七年，这个大队高小毕业生六十二人，升入中学的只有十三人，其中贫下中农子女只占五人。由于学校收费高，每年一个学生的各种费用就要花一百六十多元，等于一个劳力一年劳动收入的三分之二还多，贫下中农供不起，有些升学的贫下中农子女不得不中途退学。同时，贫下中农也看到，自己的子女进城后，思想、生活天天在变化，放假回来怕脏、怕累、好吃、好穿，贫下中农非常不满意。他们决心在自己的家门口办一所能为贫下中农服务的学校。
    一九五八年三月，南溪大队的贫下中农在大跃进中，把农中创办起来了。
    毛主席教导我们：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”南溪农中办起来后，社会上的阶级敌人和旧的习惯势力，指责南溪农中是“不伦不类”，不象私塾，不象学校，不象生产队。这时，有一些人动摇了，有的学生也不来上学了。贫下中农能不能办学？能不能把学校办好？在严峻的阶级斗争中，老贫农欧葵应挺身而出，鼓励大家说：“我们贫下中农办学是破天荒的事。自古以来地主教子学收租，我们贫下中农办学教出来的子弟，就要能文能武爱劳动。在毛主席领导下，我们一定能把学校办好。”通过耐心地做思想工作，入学的学生又由十几人增加到三十多人。但是，公社党内一小撮走资派，又采取调、并、拆的办法，企图把文权从贫下中农手中夺走，阴谋把南溪农中上调归公社办，走普通中学那条脱离实际、脱离劳动的道路。贫下中农看在眼里，痛在心上，他们坚决反对这种做法，坚持按照毛主席指示办学，由贫下中农直接管理这所农业中学。
    资产阶级的办学路线没有把贫下中农办的这所中学压垮，就采取“拉”的手段，他们打着支持农业中学的旗号，以物资作为诱饵，给南溪农中送来了价值两千九百多元的试验仪器。这批试验仪器中，除了少量的显微镜、土壤测验箱、天平、湿温计外，大量的是与农中教学无关的器材。这就提出了一个问题，是按这批器材来安排教学，还是继续从农村实际出发，使试验为教学和生产服务呢？这是关系到农业中学要不要改变教育方向的问题。南溪大队的贫下中农说：“我们要让子女到集体生产中去练真工夫，关在房子里学洋码，会成为书呆子。”他们根据教学的需要，把一些确实适用的器材留下来交给老师供教学辅导，其它的原封不动地保管起来。现在，这批没用的“洋器材”，成了学生批判资产阶级办学路线的活靶子。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”农村中反动的封建残余势力和自发的资本主义势力，也通过各种渠道向学校渗透，妄图争夺农村的年青一代。一九六三年，当第一届农中学生将要毕业时，反动的封建宗族把头就跳出来，修宗祠、盖庙宇、募钱捐款，大搞祭祠活动，要领应届毕业生去拜祠祭祖，闹得村里乌烟瘴气。苦大仇深的老贫农非常愤恨，对农中学生说：“我们今天的好日子是谁给的？是毛主席给的，你们今天读书的机会是谁给的？是毛主席给的，毛主席让我们贫下中农子弟都能读上书，为了什么？是为了干社会主义。族长出面搞拜祠祭祖，就是要我们回到旧社会再受压迫。你们读了书，要听毛主席的话，千万不要被歪门邪道迷了心眼。”在贫下中农的开导下，农中的学生拒绝参加拜祠祭祖。在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命师生遵照毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的伟大教导，砸烂了祠堂里的祖宗牌和大大小小的菩萨，大揭封建宗族把头的阴谋诡计，揪出了一批长期隐藏的反革命分子，大快人心。
    南溪农中在复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争风浪中成长的实践告诉了我们：文权也是关系到农村建设社会主义的千年大计问题。在农村，苦大仇深的贫下中农政治觉悟最高，最忠于毛主席，最听毛主席的话，执行毛主席的指示最坚决。他们是农村文化的主人，农村的文权应当在他们手上牢牢地掌管。
    实践证明，贫下中农完全能够办好学校，几年来南溪农中进行了一些改革。它有以下几个特点：
    一、突出毛泽东思想，把对学生的政治思想教育摆在首要地位。他们以解放军为榜样，大抓毛主席著作的学习，一九六五年初，按照贫下中农的意见，把语文课同政治课合并，让学生有更多的时间学习毛主席著作。从此，学校每一学期开学的第一课讲的就是《为人民服务》。
    二、大队推选出苦大仇深、政治觉悟高的贫下中农组成校务委员会，负责学校的领导工作。学生入学由贫下中农负责政治审查，学生中贫下中农子女占百分之九十以上。在贫下中农的帮助下，学校的教学作到了从生产实际出发编写教材，学以致用，学用结合。
    三、为了便于贫下中农子女入学，学校还办有预备班。这样，小学三、四年文化程度的贫下中农子女也可以升入农中学习。学校的考试制度从一九六四年以来就改用以实地操作的效果来评定，辅以文字测验，废除留级制。
    四、课程少而精，注意采用乡土教材。语文书写侧重农村应用文。数学除基础课外，侧重于本市会计辅导站编写的农村会计簿记资料、土地测量、产量估算等，使教材每学期都有更新，学生学了新知识，学了就能用。
    五、自力更生，因陋就简。学校课桌、椅、黑板是学生动手钉起来的，学生入学带的不是旧“三宝”
  （笔、墨、砚），而是毛主席著作、锄头和扁担新“三宝”。贫下中农对学生参加生产劳动要求非常严格，学校除组织学生参加校内试验基地和大队生产劳动外，还与当地国营林场签订幼林抚育合同，劳动收入解决了学校很多开支，学生读书不花钱。贫下中农说这样的学校好处多，红了思想，学到文化，炼了筋骨，保持了贫下中农的本色。
    六、学校办有义务的兽医站、农技站、会计辅导站，学生学到的知识，马上就能为大队集体生产服务。这所学校办的兽医医疗站，几年来为大队治愈八十多头次病牛，五百多头次病猪。在治疗中，老师同学生一起出诊，一起诊断、开方、注射。有一次第九生产队的母牛害急病，学校立即组织老师、学生和老农三结合小组，赶到现场会诊治疗，终于把这头牛治好了。贫下中农反映说：“我们农中的人都是真才实学，能说会干。”这所农中还把自己实验地培育的优良品种，供大队使用。每到年终分配时，学校还组织高年级学生到各生产队帮助清工结账。
    七、有深厚的群众基础。贫下中农清楚地看到，从农中培养出来的学生思想觉悟高，热爱劳动，回到队里就是一个全劳力，与普中学生成了鲜明的对比，贫下中农越发感到农中办得好，自己称意，因此办学热情更高，都愿意把自己的子女送到农业中学。
