They are how they rely on the masses
—The experiences of the Party Branch of the Fourth Company of a certain unit attending the meeting of the Four Good Companies of the Wuhan Military Region in implementing and executing Chairman Mao's mass line

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses." At the recent meeting of the Four Good Companies of the People's Liberation Army in Wuhan, the representative of the Party Branch of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, Tang Guoxian, introduced their experiences of firmly believing in and relying on the masses, closely connecting with the masses, humbly learning from the masses, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to excellently complete the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks. His speech was warmly welcomed by the representatives at the meeting.

Firmly believe in the masses and boldly let cadres and soldiers undergo tempering in the stormy seas

The Fourth Company is an advanced collective that has made new contributions to the people during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Last summer, they followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "support the broad leftist masses" and entered the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to carry out the task of supporting the left. At that time, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in this region was extremely fierce. Many units of the Railway Bureau and some nearby departments urgently requested the company to send cadres and soldiers to support them. Should they go or not? The Party Branch Committee had a debate. Some said that supporting the broad leftist masses is our task, and the broad cadres and soldiers can also be tempered and tested in this great revolutionary storm, so they should go. Others were concerned that the troops were too scattered and difficult to lead, and if things went wrong, they might lose the Four Good status. Regarding this issue, the committee members studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." They initially realized that whether or not to send the troops to support the left involved a question of whether or not to believe in the masses. Therefore, they decided to select eighteen cadres to be distributed to various points to carry out the task of supporting the left. However, as soon as the cadres were sent out, a reaction arose among all the soldiers in the company. The soldiers pointed out bluntly: The Party Branch only believes in a few cadres and does not believe in the majority of the masses. The most opinions came from the artillery squad. The committee members wanted to explain, but they did not have sufficient reasons to convince everyone. Later, after discussion, they decided to let the artillery squad also try.

The comrades of the artillery squad, with their profound proletarian feelings of loving Chairman Mao and the people, went to the Nanyang Village Railway Station, which is more than thirty li away from the company. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction to protect the leftists and, in the work of supporting the left, stood firm and held high the banner, supporting and protecting the revolutionary masses of the station. They also went deep into the nearby villages to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and were praised by the broad revolutionary masses. Despite this, some members of the Party Branch were still not at ease: The artillery squad's support for the left was good, but how was the ideological revolutionization of the entire squad? One morning, the company commander Li Mingyi rushed to the Nanyang Village Railway Station with this question. At that time, the soldiers were holding a study session, enthusiastically discussing their experiences of breaking private interests and establishing public interests by studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the class struggle. The comrades' deeds of using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds and fight against evil winds and waves were so inspiring that Li Mingyi received a great education. At this study session, he deeply examined his own erroneous thoughts of not believing in the masses.

Why did some committee members think that the artillery squad, which had a relatively weak ideological foundation, could consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and excellently complete the task of supporting the left in a situation far from leadership? With this question in mind, the Party Branch immediately organized the committee members to study. Chairman Mao teaches: "The masses possess a great deal of socialist enthusiasm. Those who can only follow the routine in the revolutionary period do not see this enthusiasm at all.... They always underestimate the enthusiasm of the people." Everyone deeply examined themselves and realized that the broad soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the true heroes of the times and can exert boundless power in the socialist revolution. The Party Branch decided to let all the comrades in the company, including the messenger, barber, medic, bugler, and cook, all go to the stormy seas of class struggle for tempering. All the cadres and soldiers in the company, with their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, held high the portrait of Chairman Mao and carried the works of Chairman Mao, went deep into various units, armed the broad revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, helped them to firmly, accurately, and vigorously strike a small handful of class enemies, and promoted the great situation of the Cultural Revolution in this region.

The soldiers fought on the front line, learned to swim in the stormy seas of class struggle, and inevitably drank some water. Whether or not to firmly believe that the soldiers could learn to swim after drinking water was another test of whether the Party Branch of the Fourth Company believed in the masses. A soldier had not done well in supporting the left in two units in a row. The Party Branch brought him back. Some people even said that this soldier's furnace was too hot to forge steel. Could this soldier be forged into steel? With this question in mind, the committee members studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said: "Communist spirit is flourishing throughout the country. The political awareness of the broad masses is rapidly improving. The backward strata among the masses are striving to catch up with the advanced strata." The committee members combined Chairman Mao's teachings and had a serious discussion, realizing that it was not that this soldier could not be forged into steel, but that we took the iron out of the furnace when the fire was burning. The Party Branch decided to send him back to the school to support the left. Before this soldier went down, the committee members studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings with him, studied the Party's policies, encouraged him to humbly learn from the masses, and bravely go to the forefront of class struggle to change himself and improve his political awareness. This soldier followed Chairman Mao's teachings in practice, constantly changed his thoughts, and his awareness of the struggle between the two lines improved rapidly. He excellently completed the task of supporting the left in the school and other places.

Closely rely on the masses and correctly lead the masses forward

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution continued to deepen, the "support the left" points of the Fourth Company became more and more, the scope became wider and wider, and the tasks became more and more arduous. In the situation of highly dispersed personnel, the Party Branch of the Fourth Company decided to plan once a week to propagate to the masses, unify the content, methods, steps, and specific time of propaganda, and facilitate leadership. However, this method was not implemented for long before the comrades supporting the left at various points proposed that the plan did not suit the actual situation of their units, was not applicable, and restricted their hands and feet.

When the masses had opinions, the committee members brought the problems back for serious study of Chairman Mao's relevant teachings. They deeply felt that it was not enough to solve the problem of believing in the masses; they must also solve the problem of correctly leading the masses. Only by insisting on the working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, closely relying on the masses, can they correctly lead the masses forward. From then on, the members of the Party Branch of the Fourth Company often went deep into the masses, understood the masses, consulted with the masses on every matter, gathered the correct opinions and experiences of the masses, and then promoted them among the masses, leading the masses to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and move forward.

Instructor Tang Guoxian went to a machinery workshop of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to conduct a point-to-point investigation to explore experiences in helping the masses quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on establishing revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination. He conducted investigations and research with the soldiers, held classes to study Mao Zedong Thought for the revolutionary masses, carried out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, raised the class consciousness of the masses, and quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions to establish a revolutionary committee. The Party Branch seriously summarized the experience of this unit and promoted it in all points of the company. In less than a month, revolutionary committees were established in all points.

Sergeant Zhang Guosheng was alone in supporting the left in a factory of more than three hundred people in the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. Zhang Guosheng helped the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the banner in all fields, held ten sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and quickly changed the face of the entire factory, creating a high tide of grabbing revolution and promoting production. This factory was established by the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau as an advanced unit for grabbing revolution and promoting production and introduced its experience at the meeting of the special district for grabbing revolution and promoting production. The Party Branch again seriously summarized the experience of this point and promoted it throughout the company. A large number of facts made the comrades of the Party Branch deeply feel that "the masses are the real heroes," and no matter how difficult it is, relying on the broad masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought would not be difficult.

In the practice of struggle, the Party Branch of the Fourth Company realized: Relying on the masses is not about letting go and not managing; strengthening leadership is not about taking over and replacing. Only by insisting on coming from the masses and going to the masses, opposing both subjectivism and tailism, can we closely connect with the masses and correctly lead the masses. Deputy Political Instructor An Qinghong and seven soldiers supported the left in a school. After the revolutionary committee of this school was established, how should the work be grasped? An Qinghong thought that although the work was complex, it was still necessary to grasp the line of class struggle. When he put forward this opinion, some soldiers disagreed, thinking that after the revolutionary committee was established, the first thing to do was to resume classes. An Qinghong realized that the soldiers had not clarified the relationship between resuming classes for revolution and grasping class struggle, and decided to help the revolutionary committee draft a plan to clean up the class ranks first. This thought flashed through his mind, and Chairman Mao's teachings immediately rang in his ears: "When the masses are not yet aware, we attack, that is adventurism. Things that the masses do not want to do, we force them to do, the result will necessarily be failure." Chairman Mao's teachings made him think deeply. He deeply felt that as a leading cadre, he should not only rely on the masses and mobilize the masses in general situations but also, when his opinions are correct compared to the masses, he should explain the reasons to the masses and firmly follow the path of relying on the masses. He immediately checked his own erroneous thoughts with the soldiers, repeatedly explained the importance of grasping class struggle to everyone, explained that resuming classes is to resume revolutionary classes, class struggle classes, and classes to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone unified their thoughts and worked together to help the revolutionary committee draft a plan to clean up the class ranks, widely and deeply mobilized the masses, and exposed the class enemies who had long been hiding in the revolutionary ranks.

Cadres should humbly learn from the masses and bravely follow the great leader Chairman Mao forward

The Party Branch of the Fourth Company received profound education in the practice of struggle, deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's great teachings that "the masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable." Over the years, the members of the Party Branch and the leading cadres, with the attitude of being willing to be students of the masses, lived among the masses, studied, worked, lived, and fought with the soldiers, humbly learned from the soldiers, constantly changed their worldviews, and promoted ideological revolutionization. A cadre had previously had feelings of pride and self-satisfaction. In the fierce class struggle, he took the broad soldiers and revolutionary masses as examples, worked hard to overcome his shortcomings, and bravely followed the great leader Chairman Mao forward. In May, he was selected as a representative to the Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the Wuhan Military Region. Another cadre previously thought that he had low culture, could not speak, could not write, and was not content with his job. This time, he supported the left with the soldiers and saw everyone "offering their red hearts to Chairman Mao, diligently and conscientiously serving the people," which deeply moved him. He took the soldiers as examples, fought hard against the private and杂 thoughts in his mind, and his ideological appearance changed greatly. His revolutionary enthusiasm greatly increased, and his comrades happily said that he had changed. Through learning from the soldiers, the leading members of the Party Branch made new leaps in ideological revolutionization. Long-standing problems were solved, the relationship between officers and soldiers became more harmonious, the unity between superiors and subordinates improved, the relationship between the military and the people became closer, and the spirit of the company was renewed. The situation of creating Four Goods and striving for Five Goods became better and better. The entire company had fifty-six people who joined the Communist Party of China, and seventy-three percent of the soldiers were rated as Five Good Soldiers. From practice, they further felt that only by humbly learning from the masses, being willing to be students of the masses, can they constantly increase their wisdom, constantly improve themselves, and better use the wisdom and experience of the masses to educate and lead the masses. Otherwise, they would not have the qualifications to be leaders and would not be able to be good servants of the people. Under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, they decided to further closely connect with the masses, more humbly learn from the masses, better change themselves, and lead the broad cadres and soldiers to bravely follow the great leader Chairman Mao forward!

    他们是怎样依靠群众的
    ——出席武汉部队四好连队工作会议的某部四连党支部贯彻执行毛主席的群众路线的几点体会
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”在人民解放军武汉部队最近举行的四好连队工作会议上，某部四连党支部代表唐国先介绍了他们坚决相信和依靠群众，密切联系群众，虚心向群众学习，促进部队思想革命化，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，出色地完成“三支”“两军”任务的体会。他的发言，在会上受到了代表们的热烈欢迎。
    坚定地相信群众　放手让干部战士到大风大浪中经受锻炼
    四连，是在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立了新功的先进集体。去年夏天，他们遵循毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，进驻郑州铁路局担负支左任务。当时，这个地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争异常激烈，铁路局许多单位和附近一些部门的无产阶级革命派，迫切要求连队派干部战士去支持他们。是去，还是不去？党支委会上有了争论。有的说，支持左派广大群众是我们的任务，广大干部战士也能在这场伟大的革命风暴中经受锻炼和考验，应该去。有的耽心把部队分得太散，不好领导，弄不好会丢了四好。针对这个问题，支委们学习了毛主席的教导：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”他们初步认识到，让不让部队去支左，这里有一个相信不相信群众的问题。于是，他们决定挑选十八名骨干，分配到各点去担负支左任务。谁知刚把骨干派出去，就在全连战士中引起了反应。战士们一针见血地指出：党支部只相信少数骨干，不相信大多数群众。意见最多的是炮班。支委们想解释，但又没有充分的理由说服大家。后来经过研究，就决定让炮班也出去试试。
    炮班的同志们怀着无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱人民的深厚的无产阶级感情，到了离连队三十多里的南阳寨火车站。他们遵照毛主席的要保护左派的教导，在支左工作中立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，支持和保护了车站的无产阶级革命派。他们还深入附近村庄，宣传毛泽东思想，受到广大革命群众的称赞。尽管这样，党支部有的同志还放心不下：炮班支左不错，但全班的思想革命化搞得怎样？一天早上，连长李明义带着这个问题赶到南阳寨火车站。当时，战士们正在开讲用会，畅谈在阶级斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想破私立公的体会。同志们处处用毛泽东思想武装头脑，顶歪风、战恶浪的一桩桩生动事迹，使李明义受到很大教育。就在这个讲用会上，他深刻地检查了自己不相信群众的错误思想。
    为什么一些支委认为思想基础比较差的炮班，能够在远离领导的情况下，自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，出色地完成支左任务呢？带着这个问题，党支部立即组织支委进行学习。毛主席教导说：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。那些在革命时期还只会按照常规走路的人们，对于这种积极性一概看不见。……老是对于人民的积极性估计过低。”大家深刻地检查自己，认识到用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大战士，是时代的真正英雄，在社会主义革命中能发挥无穷无尽的力量。党支部决定让连队所有同志，包括通讯员、理发员、卫生员、司号员、炊事员，全部到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去锻炼。全连干部战士怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，高举着毛主席画像，带着毛主席著作，深入各个单位，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，帮助他们稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，促进了这个地区文化大革命的大好形势。
    战士们在第一线战斗，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中学游泳，有的不免要喝几口水。是否坚信战士们在喝了水之后能学会游泳，这是对四连党支部领导相信不相信群众的又一考验。有个战士，一连在两个单位支左都搞得不怎么出色。党支部把他调了回来。有的人甚至说，这个战士炉火再旺也炼不成钢。这个战士到底能不能炼成钢材？带着这个问题，支委们又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展。广大群众的政治觉悟迅速提高。群众中的落后阶层奋发起来努力赶上先进阶层”。支委们结合毛主席的教导，进行了认真的讨论，认识到不是这个战士这块铁炼不成钢，而是我们在炉火正旺时把这块铁抽出来了。党支部决定，再次把他派到学校去支左。这个战士下去之前，支委们和他一起反复学习了毛主席的有关教导，学习党的政策，鼓励他虚心向群众学习，勇敢地到阶级斗争的风口上去改造自己，提高政治觉悟。这个战士在实践中处处遵照毛主席的教导，不断改造自己的思想，两条路线斗争觉悟提高很快。他在学校和其他地方支左，都胜利完成了任务。
  紧紧地依靠群众　正确地领导群众前进
    无产阶级文化大革命运动不断深入发展，四连的“支左”点越来越多，面越铺越大，任务也越来越繁重。在人员高度分散的情况下，四连党支部决定每星期订一次向群众进行宣传的计划，把宣传内容、方法、步骤和具体时间统一起来，便于领导。这样实行没有多久，在各个点上支左的同志纷纷提出，计划不适合本单位的实际情况，用不上，束缚了手脚。
    群众有了意见，支委们又带着问题认真学习毛主席的有关教导。他们深深感到：光解决相信群众的问题还不够，还必须解决正确领导群众的问题。只有坚持从群众中来，到群众中去的工作方法，紧紧地依靠群众，才能正确地领导群众前进。从此，四连党支部的成员经常深入群众，了解群众，遇事先和群众商量，将群众中的正确意见和经验集中起来，再在群众中推广，领导群众紧跟毛主席的战略部署不断前进。
    指导员唐国先为了摸索帮助群众迅速落实毛主席关于建立三结合的革命委员会的最新指示的经验，到郑州铁路局的一个设备车间蹲点。他同战士们一起调查研究，针对革命群众的活思想，大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展忆苦思甜活动，提高了群众的阶级觉悟，迅速落实了毛主席的最新指示，成立了革命委员会。党支部认真总结了这个单位的经验，在全连各点推广，不到一个月，各点也都成立了革命委员会。
    班长张国胜，单独在郑州铁路局一个三百多人的工厂支左。张国胜帮助全厂革命群众坚持在一切领域中用毛泽东思想挂帅，办了十期毛泽东思想学习班，使全厂很快呈现一派新面貌，出现了抓革命促生产的高潮。这个厂被郑州铁路局树立为抓革命促生产的先进单位，并在专区抓革命促生产的会议上介绍了经验。党支部又认真总结了这个点的经验，在全连推广。大量事实，使党支部的同志深深体会到“群众是真正的英雄”，千难万难，依靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大群众就不难。
    在斗争的实践中，四连党支部认识到：依靠群众绝不是放手不管；加强领导，绝不是包办代替。只有坚持从群众中来，到群众中去，既反对主观主义，又反对尾巴主义，才能密切联系群众，正确领导群众。副政治指导员安庆宏和七个战士在一个学校支左。这个学校革命委员会成立后，工作应该怎么抓？安庆宏想，尽管工作千头万绪，还是要抓住阶级斗争这条纲。当他把这个意见提出来后，有的战士不同意，认为革委会成立后应当先复课。安庆宏觉察到，战士们没有把复课闹革命和抓阶级斗争的关系弄清楚，决定自己先帮助革委会拟订一个清理阶级队伍的计划再说。这个念头一闪，毛主席的教导立即响在他的耳边：“当着群众还不觉悟的时候，我们要进攻，那是冒险主义。群众不愿干的事，我们硬要领导他们去干，其结果必然失败。”毛主席的教导引起了他的深思。他深深感到，作为一个领导干部，不仅要在一般情况下依靠群众，发动群众，而且在自己意见比群众正确时，也应该给群众讲清道理，坚定不移地走依靠群众的道路。他立即向战士们检查了自己的错误思想，反复向大家阐明抓阶级斗争的重要意义，阐明复课就是要复革命的课，复阶级斗争的课，复活学活用毛泽东思想的课。大家统一了思想，同心协力地帮助革命委员会拟订出清理阶级队伍的计划，广泛深入地发动群众，揪出了长期隐藏在革命队伍内部的阶级敌人。
      干部要虚心向群众学习　紧跟伟大
  领袖毛主席奋勇前进
    四连党支部在斗争实践中受到深刻的教育，加深了对伟大领袖毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”伟大教导的理解。几年来，党支部成员和领导干部，以甘当群众小学生的姿态，生活在群众之中，和战士们同学习、同劳动、同生活、同战斗，虚心向战士们学习，不断改造自己的世界观，促进思想革命化。有个干部过去有骄傲自满情绪。在火热的阶级斗争中，他以广大战士和革命群众为榜样，努力克服自己的缺点，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，今年五月被选为武汉部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会代表。另一个干部过去认为自己文化低，不会说，不会写，不安心本职工作。这次他同战士们一起支左，见到大家“红心献给毛主席，勤勤恳恳为人民”，很受感动。他以战士们为榜样，狠斗自己头脑中的私心杂念，思想面貌发生了很大变化，革命干劲大大提高，同志们高兴地说他变样了。
    通过向战士学习，支部领导成员在思想革命化方面出现了新的飞跃。过去长期没有解决的问题得到了解决，官兵关系更融洽了，上下级之间的团结更好了，军民关系更加密切，连队的精神面貌焕然一新，创四好、争五好的形势越来越好。全连有五十六人加入了中国共产党，百分之七十三的战士被评为五好战士。从实践中他们进一步体会到：只有虚心向群众学习，甘当群众的小学生，才能不断地增长智慧，不断地提高自己，才能更好地用群众的智慧、经验来教育群众，领导群众，否则就没有资格当领导，就当不好人民群众的勤务员。在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，他们决心更加密切联系群众，更虚心地向群众学习，更好地改造自己，带领广大指战员紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进！　新华社通讯员　新华社记者
