The first socialist state in the world, the Soviet Union, was dragged back to the capitalist road by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. This is a great historical tragedy. However, we have firm confidence that the revolutionary faction of the Soviet proletariat will definitely rise up again to fight under the banner of Lenin and Stalin.

Recently, comrades from the "Stalin Group" in the Soviet Union have sounded the new call to a great struggle. As we read the revolutionary leaflets of the "Stalin Group," it is as if we hear the powerful voice of the Soviet revolutionary people and feel their pulsating heartbeat.

This leaflet is a proclamation denouncing the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. Every word and sentence is filled with the Soviet people's implacable hatred for a handful of traitors, angrily accusing them of restoring capitalism at home and sabotaging the world revolution.

This leaflet is a grand call to revolution. It loudly calls on the Soviet proletariat and working people to fight against oppression and exploitation, to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and to rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has established a fascist dictatorship at home and is crazily pursuing a policy of social imperialism, wantonly infringing upon the sovereignty and independence of other countries. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is a vicious enemy of the Soviet people and all revolutionary people of the world.

To overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and to rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union, it is necessary to follow the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, to hold high the banner of the October Revolution, and to use revolutionary violence to counter the counter-revolutionary violence of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. It is necessary to arm all Soviet revolutionary people with Marxist-Leninist thought, to further expose the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, to unite the broad masses of the people, to form a mighty force, and to launch continuous attacks on the counter-revolutionary forces.

The struggle requires courage and determination. To rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union, it is even more necessary to have a fearless heroic spirit and a thorough revolutionary spirit. From the revolutionary leaflets of the "Stalin Group," we see that the Soviet revolutionary people have this courage and determination, this unyielding revolutionary spirit.

"A single spark can start a prairie fire." The leaflets of the "Stalin Group" are the sparks of revolution, which will spread among the Soviet revolutionary people and will surely ignite a prairie fire.

The rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique will not last long. The leaflets of the "Stalin Group" have sounded the death knell for them.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The broad masses of the people, the broad ranks of Party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." Reading the leaflets of the "Stalin Group" in the Soviet Union, we are even more firmly convinced of this.

    苏联革命人民的进军号
    ——为苏联“斯大林小组”的革命传单欢呼

    世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联，被苏修叛徒集团拖回到资本主义道路。这是一个历史的大悲剧。但是，我们怀着坚定的信心：苏联的无产阶级革命派一定会重新举起列宁和斯大林的旗帜起来战斗。
    最近，苏联“斯大林小组”的同志，吹响了新的伟大斗争的进军号。我们读着“斯大林小组”的革命传单，仿佛听到了苏联革命人民强大的心声，感受到他们跳动着的脉搏。
    这张传单，是声讨苏修叛徒集团的檄文。它字字句句充满苏联人民对一小撮叛徒不共戴天的仇恨，愤怒地控诉他们在国内复辟资本主义和破坏世界革命的罪行。
    这张传单，是气势磅礴的革命号召书。它以响亮的声音号召苏联无产阶级和劳动人民，为反对压迫和剥削，打倒苏修叛徒集团的反动统治，重建无产阶级专政而斗争。
    苏修叛徒集团在国内建立法西斯专政，同时疯狂地推行社会帝国主义政策，肆意侵犯别的国家的主权和独立。苏修叛徒集团，是苏联人民和全世界革命人民的凶恶敌人。
    要推翻苏修叛徒集团的反动统治，在苏联重建无产阶级专政，这就必须遵循列宁和斯大林的教导，高高举起十月革命的旗帜，用革命的暴力去对付苏修叛徒集团的反革命暴力。这就必须用马克思列宁主义思想武装全体苏联革命人民，进一步剥落苏修叛徒集团的画皮，把广大人民团结起来，组成一支浩浩荡荡的队伍，向反革命势力发动连续的进攻。
    斗争，需要勇气和决心。要在苏联重建无产阶级专政，就更加需要大无畏的英雄气概和彻底革命的精神。我们从“斯大林小组”的革命传单中看到，苏联革命人民有的是这种勇气和决心，有的是这种一往无前的革命精神。
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”“斯大林小组”的传单是革命的火种，它在苏联革命人民之间蔓延，必将燃成燎原的大火。
    苏修叛徒集团的统治是不会长久的。“斯大林小组”的传单，给他们敲响了丧钟。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”读着苏联“斯大林小组”的传单，我们更坚定地相信这一点。
