The entire nation, both urban and rural, is in a state of jubilation celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. Billions of military personnel and civilians enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, initiating a new wave of knowledge youth going to the countryside. Revolutionary masses beat drums and gongs, hold rallies and parades; various levels of revolutionary committees immediately formulate and implement measures; large numbers of knowledge youth joyfully head to the countryside.

New China News Agency, December 22nd: The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "It is very necessary for knowledge youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and others to send their children, who have graduated from junior high, senior high, or college, to the countryside, and mobilize them. Rural comrades in various places should welcome them." Chairman Mao's brilliant latest directive has greatly inspired the nationwide billions of military personnel and civilians who are deeply engaged in the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines and are carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. From last night to today, revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers in major cities, medium and small towns, and vast rural areas across the nation are in a state of jubilation. Despite the cold and snow, they beat drums and gongs, hold rallies and parades, and enthusiastically cheer for the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. The vast number of knowledge youth enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, initiating a new wave of going to the countryside. Billions of military personnel and civilians express their determination to seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, further raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Last night, when the news of Chairman Mao's latest directive, as well as the important editorial note from the People's Daily and the news of some urban residents in Gansu Province's Haining County rushing to the front line of agricultural production, reached various places, the cities, towns, pastoral areas, and islands across the nation were all in a state of jubilation. Amidst the cheers, drumbeats, and firecrackers that shook the night sky, people in various places carried portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and placards with his latest directives, waved the Little Red Book, and held grand rallies and parades. In the sea of jubilation, people wrote passionate poems: "Great news from Beijing, the latest directive warms the heart. Knowledge youth respond in unison, with great enthusiasm heading to the countryside. Accepting re-education from workers and peasants, fighting against heaven and earth to overcome selfishness. Following the commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, in the vast land, tempering loyalty." Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and the revolutionary committee locations in Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet provinces and autonomous regions were in a state of boiling excitement throughout the night. The parade, propaganda, and joyous teams flowed endlessly. Many provincial, municipal, and autonomous region revolutionary committees held meetings overnight, seriously studied, and had heated discussions, and immediately formulated implementation measures. Some places issued notices overnight, calling on the revolutionary masses to act with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and strive to be models in implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive. Some regions held mobilization meetings with tens of thousands to tens of millions of people, initiating a new wave of knowledge youth settling down in the countryside. The joyous news reached Gansu Province's Haining County, and the county's 310,000 poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses were immersed in boundless joy. Nearly 2,000 revolutionary masses in Haining County held a celebration rally in front of the Red Army Meeting Building. They expressed their determination to, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directive, continue to advance and strive to do a better job in sending urban residents and knowledge youth to settle down in the countryside, and to greatly advance the work in various aspects of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various schools held meetings overnight to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directive to revolutionary teachers and students, and led them to fiercely criticize and expose the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" and "go to the countryside to gild oneself" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist trash, greatly raising the political awareness of revolutionary teachers and students. The leadership organs of various departments of the People's Liberation Army held grand meetings and celebration parades overnight and issued notices, calling on the broad masses of soldiers and officers to immediately initiate a wave of seriously studying, enthusiastically propagating, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive. Various departments dispatched large numbers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, crossing mountains and rivers, rushing to cities and countryside, and spreading Chairman Mao's latest directive to every household. Various departments carried out the activity of writing red letters, mobilizing their relatives and classmates to resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's directive and go to the front line of agricultural production. The broad masses of soldiers and officers fighting on the "three supports and two militaries" front line, while enthusiastically cheering for the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, actively assisted various local revolutionary committees in setting up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing knowledge youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

Billions of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, urban residents, and knowledge youth across the nation conducted overnight study and discussion after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive. They unanimously agreed that the latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao is a great strategic deployment; it is a new battle order from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin; it is a hundred-year and thousand-year plan to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent capitalist restoration, and build socialism; it is the fundamental way to achieve the thought revolutionization of knowledge youth, cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause; it is a wise decision to build a new socialist countryside. Workers from Beijing's Northern Suburbs Timber Factory criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist trash and the old idea of "raising children to prevent old age." They said, in the old society, it was "raising children to prevent old age," but now it is "raising children to prevent revisionism." We must educate our children to always listen to Chairman Mao's words and go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. Knowledge youth who have already settled down in Shanghai City's Star Fire Farm's "May 7th" Brigade shared their experiences, saying that Chairman Mao's latest directive is the inevitable path for the broad masses of knowledge youth to achieve thought revolutionization. Under the influence of the excellent qualities of poor and lower-middle peasants, many of our comrades have undergone tremendous changes in their thoughts and feelings. We must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, take root in the countryside, and dedicate our lives to the revolution. In Henan Province's Jion County's "Broad Land, Great Achievements" People's Commune, more than 400 knowledge youth who have settled down excitedly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The countryside is a vast land where one can achieve great things.' We are determined to humbly accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants in the vast land of the countryside, temper our hearts that are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and bravely advance along the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao!" Some long-term urban residents who have been detached from labor said, under the poisoning of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, some of us have become less and less willing to labor, the less we labor, the more we look down on peasants, and the more we detach from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, gradually becoming "eating idlers" with hands that do not want to labor and legs that do not want to walk. They expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to the front line of agricultural production, and contribute to the construction of a new socialist countryside.

Workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres in various places immediately took action, mobilizing their children and relatives to respond to Chairman Mao's great call and go to the mountains and countryside. Revolutionary workers in many factories in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin wrote determination letters, expressing their determination to, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "knowledge youth going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants," mobilize their children to settle down in the countryside. Workers from Beijing's New China Printing Factory immediately gathered their families for study and mobilization. Old worker Chen Yunxi's daughter has been approved to go to the countryside to settle down. Chen Yunxi and his wife were very happy and said, "After hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, we firmly support you going to the countryside to join the production team. When your younger sister graduates next year, let her go too. I will retire, and our whole family will move there." In Guangzhou City, Hainan Province, a 60-year-old old worker from the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, Fu Maoping, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, has already sent his two middle school graduates to the countryside to settle down. He excitedly said, Chairman Mao's latest directive, word by word, sentence by sentence, has touched the hearts of us workers. The traitor Liu Shaoqi attempted to turn our cities into capitalist cities and turn our descendants into "eating idlers." We workers will never agree to this. The Ministry of Building Materials Industry and its subordinate units held various types of symposiums from last night to today, seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. Many cadres with children returned home and organized family study classes, carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and educated their children to walk the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directive, cities such as Tianjin, Wuhan, and Jinan today have another batch of knowledge youth joyfully heading to the countryside to settle down. More cities have large and middle school graduates who are about to head to the countryside. Many schools are covered with big-character posters and determination letters from students requesting to go to the countryside. Some students in Beijing proudly declared, "With the Little Red Book in hand, leaving Beijing, determined to take root among workers and peasants, in the vast land, tempering a red heart, sewing loyalty to the universe red!" Pan Hongji, a Red Guard from the graduating class of Guizhou's New Second Middle School, firmly headed to the front line of agricultural production after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive. She excitedly said, "I was born and raised in the city, studied for more than ten years, and was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, the more I studied, the more I became spoiled. Chairman Mao's great call, I will firmly respond to." Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directive, she and all her classmates wrote applications to go to the countryside.

In various urban and rural areas, there are moving scenes of parents encouraging their children to sign up to go to the countryside and families voluntarily requesting to settle down in the countryside. Revolutionary residents in Jiangsu Province's Hai'an County's Jiaoqiao Town said during the study of Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Not laboring and eating idly will turn into parasites. On the day after Chairman Mao's latest directive was issued, the entire town had 132 knowledge youth and residents heading to the countryside to settle down." A woman in Shenyang City's Peace District's Taiyuan Commune with ten children excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's words have all touched my heart. My ten children have eight who have studied, and now two are working and one is in the army. The remaining three, I let them respond to Chairman Mao's call to go to the countryside. I will also respond to Chairman Mao's call, go to the countryside to participate in labor, and contribute to the socialist revolution and socialist construction."

Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various rural areas expressed that the great leader Chairman Mao has entrusted us with the glorious task of educating knowledge youth. We must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "rural comrades in various places should welcome them," warmly welcome the broad masses of knowledge youth and urban residents to settle down in the countryside. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to educate them, care for them politically, take care of them in life, help them in labor, and let them grow and temper themselves in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, and quickly become "socialist-conscious and cultured laborers," together with us to build the vast land of the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    昨夜，当毛主席的最新指示，以及传达这一指示的《人民日报》重要编者按和甘肃省会宁县部分城镇居民奔赴农业生产第一线的消息传到各地后，全国的城镇、乡村、牧区和海岛，到处一片欢腾。在震撼夜空的欢呼声、锣鼓声和鞭炮声中，各地军民抬着伟大领袖毛主席画像和最新指示的语录牌，挥动红色宝书，举行声势浩大的集会游行。在欢腾的海洋里，人们写出了热情洋溢的诗歌：“北京传来大喜讯，最新指示照人心。知识青年齐响应，满怀豪情下农村。接受工农再教育，战天斗地破私心。紧跟统帅毛主席，广阔天地炼忠心。”北京、上海、天津和河北、山西、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、陕西、宁夏、青海、新疆、山东、江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、福建、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、四川、云南、贵州、西藏等省、自治区革委会所在地，整夜在沸腾。游行队伍、宣传队伍、报喜队伍川流不息。许多省、市、自治区革委会连夜召开会议，认真学习，热烈讨论，并立即制订落实措施。不少地方的革委会当晚发出通知，号召广大革命群众以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，争做执行毛主席最新指示的模范。有些地区召开了几万到十几万人的动员大会，掀起了知识青年到农村安家落户的新高潮。喜讯传到甘肃省会宁县，全县三十一万贫下中农和革命群众沉浸在无比欢乐中。会宁县城有近两千革命群众在红军会师楼前，举行庆祝大会。他们表示，一定要在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，再接再厉，乘胜前进，努力把城镇居民和知识青年下乡落户的工作做得更好，把斗、批、改各方面的工作大大推进一步。
    各地进驻学校领导斗、批、改的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，连夜召开大会，向革命师生宣传毛主席的最新指示，并且领导革命师生狠揭猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“读书做官论”、“下乡镀金论”等反革命修正主义黑货，大大地提高了革命师生的政治觉悟。人民解放军各部队的领导机关，连夜举行盛大集会和庆祝游行，并发出通知，号召广大指战员立即掀起认真学习、热情宣传、坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示的热潮。各部队派出了大批毛泽东思想宣传队，跋山涉水，奔赴城乡，把毛主席最新指示传到家家户户。各部队都开展了写红色书信活动，动员自己的亲友和同学，坚决照毛主席指示办事，到农业生产第一线去。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线上的广大指战员，在热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示发表的同时，积极协助各地革委会，办起各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，动员知识青年到农村去接受贫下中农的再教育。
    全国亿万工农兵群众、革命干部、城镇居民和知识青年，听到毛主席的最新指示后，连夜进行了学习讨论。他们一致认为，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，是毛主席的伟大战略部署；是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的新的战斗号令；是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义的百年大计、千年大计；是实现知识青年思想革命化，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本途径；是建设社会主义新农村的英明决策。北京北郊木材厂的广大工人批判了刘少奇的修正主义黑货和“养儿防老”的旧思想。他们说，在旧社会是“养儿防老”，现在要“养儿防修”，要教育子女永远听毛主席的话，到农村去接受贫下中农的再教育。已经在农村落户的上海市星火农场“五·七”连队的知识青年，畅谈自己的体会说，毛主席的最新指示，是广大知识青年实现思想革命化的必由之路。在贫下中农优秀品质的熏陶下，我们许多同志思想感情上都起了巨大的变化。我们一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，扎根在农村，干一辈子革命。在河南省郏县“广阔天地大有作为”人民公社安家落户的四百多名知识青年兴奋地说，毛主席教导我们：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”我们决心在农村的广阔天地里，虚心接受贫下中农的再教育，锤炼永远忠于毛主席的红心，沿着毛主席给我们指引的光辉道路奋勇前进！一些地方长期脱离劳动的城镇居民说，过去我们有些人，在大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线的毒害下，变得越来越不愿意劳动，越不劳动就越轻视农民，也就越脱离毛主席的革命路线，渐渐地成了有手不愿劳动，有腿不愿走路的“吃闲饭”的人。他们表示坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农业生产第一线去，为建设社会主义新农村作出贡献。
    各地工农兵和革命干部立即行动起来，动员自己的子女、亲属，响应毛主席的伟大号召，上山下乡。北京、上海、天津等城市的许多工厂的广大革命职工，纷纷写决心书，表示一定要遵照毛主席“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育”的教导，动员自己的子女在农村安家落户。北京新华印刷厂的许多职工立即把全家召集在一起，进行学习、动员。老工人陈云秀的大女儿已经被批准去农村落户，陈云秀和老伴非常高兴地说：“听了毛主席的最新指示，我们坚决支持你去农村插队，等你妹妹明年毕了业，也让她去。我退休了，咱们全家都搬去。”广东省海口市邮电局六十多岁的老工人符茂平，在毛主席最新指示指引下，已经把两个中学毕业的儿子送到乡下落户。他激动地说，毛主席的最新指示，字字句句说到了我们工人的心坎上。大叛徒刘少奇妄图把我们的城市变成资本主义城市，把我们的后代变成“吃闲饭”的人，他好舒舒服服地复辟资本主义，我们工人坚决不答应。建筑材料工业部及所属各单位的广大干部和职工，从昨晚到今天，连续召开了各种类型的座谈会，认真学习毛主席的最新指示。许多有子女的干部回到家里，还组织了家庭学习班，进行斗私批修，教育子女走毛主席指引的光明大道。
    在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，天津、武汉、济南等城市今天又有一批知识青年兴高采烈地奔赴农村安家落户。各城市还有更多的大、中学校毕业生即将奔赴农村。许多学校里贴满了学生要求到农村去的大字报、决心书。北京有的学生豪迈地表示：“手捧红书离北京，立志扎根工农中，广阔天地炼红心，忠心绣出宇宙红！”贵阳新二中毕业班红卫兵潘洪冀听到毛主席最新指示，坚决奔赴农业第一线。她激动地说：“我在城里生，城里长，读了十几年书，受到刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，越读越娇。毛主席的伟大号召，我坚决响应。”在毛主席最新指示鼓舞下，她和全班同学都写了下乡申请书。
    在各地城镇居民中，也出现了父母鼓励子女报名下乡、全家主动要求到农村安家落户的动人情景。江苏省海安县角斜镇革命居民在学习毛主席最新指示的时候说，吃闲饭不劳动，就要变成寄生虫。在毛主席最新指示发表的第二天，全镇就有一百三十二名知识青年和居民奔向农村安家落户。沈阳市和平区太原公社一位有十个孩子的妇女激动地说：“毛主席的话句句都说到我心坎上。我的十个孩子有八个念了书，现在已有两个工作、一个参军了，另外三个，我让他们响应毛主席的号召到农村去。我也要响应毛主席的号召，到农村参加劳动，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设出力。”
    各地农村的广大贫下中农和革命干部表示，伟大领袖毛主席把教育知识青年的光荣任务交给我们，我们一定遵照毛主席“各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去”的教导，最热烈地欢迎广大知识青年和城镇居民，到农村安家落户。我们一定要用毛泽东思想教育他们，从政治上关心他们，生活上照顾他们，劳动上帮助他们，让他们在农村三大革命运动中锻炼成长，尽快成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，同我们一起把农村这个大有作为的广阔天地建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
