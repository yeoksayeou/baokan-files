Workers and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Beijing No. 23 Middle School have led revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to address the active thoughts of graduates and their parents, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. They have conducted thorough and detailed ideological work, enabling the majority of young intellectuals to joyfully head to the countryside to settle down and receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

"Intellectual youth should go to the countryside, accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, and this is very necessary. We must persuade urban cadres and others to send their children who have graduated from junior high, senior high, and university to the countryside for re-education." On the day Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, revolutionary intellectual youth enthusiastically signed up, resolutely requesting to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. However, a small number of students still wanted to "wait and see." Various active thoughts made the propaganda team realize that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and mobilize intellectual youth to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" and "go to the countryside to gain experience" theories and do thorough and detailed ideological work.

Following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "grasping ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle," the propaganda team organized family, neighborhood, and graduate Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Using Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as weapons, they thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. At the same time, they adopted the methods of "going out" and "inviting in" to conduct thorough and detailed ideological work for the graduates. "Going out" means going to nearby factories and rural areas to learn from the workers and peasants how they implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in terms of stance, attitude, and viewpoint, thereby strengthening their confidence in going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants; going to families and neighborhoods to do ideological work for the students' parents, achieving agreement among the school, parents, and the students themselves. "Inviting in" means inviting old workers and poor peasants to tell their stories and give reports on bitter memories and sweet thoughts, arousing the revolutionary teachers and students' class hatred towards Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, and deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Junior high graduate Zhang Xiaoling used to think that her parents, having only her as their sole child, would not bear to let her leave home. In the study class, she linked her family's bitter history and said with deep feelings: "Parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer! Now that Chairman Mao calls for intellectual youth to go to the countryside, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words." She put her words into action and immediately signed up to settle in the countryside. Inspired by her, many students eliminated the thought of "waiting and seeing" and eagerly signed up to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside.

At the same time, the propaganda team also used letters from students who had already settled in the countryside to conduct propaganda and education; they invited workers and PLA comrades who had sent students to the countryside to share vivid stories of how poor and lower-middle peasants warmly welcomed them. All these inspired the graduates who were about to settle in the countryside, and they eagerly signed up to go to the countryside, to the border areas, and to where the motherland needs them the most.

    驻北京二十三中工人、解放军宣传队
    采取各种形式深入细致做好思想工作
    应届毕业生纷纷报名到农村安家落户
    本报讯　驻北京二十三中工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，领导广大革命师生员工认真落实毛主席的最新指示，针对毕业生和学生家长存在的活思想，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，做深入细致的思想工作，使广大知识青年愉快地奔赴农村安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育。
      “知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”毛主席这一最新指示发表的当天，广大革命知识青年纷纷报名，坚决要求到农村去，接受贫下中农再教育。可是，也有一少部分学生仍然想“等一等”。种种活思想，使宣传队意识到：落实毛主席最新指示，动员知识青年上山下乡，必须首先彻底肃清刘少奇“读书做官论”“下乡镀金论”的流毒，做好深入细致的思想工作。
    宣传队遵照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的伟大教导，分别举办了家庭、街道和毕业生毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席一系列最新指示为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，同时，还采取“走出去”“请进来”的方法，对毕业生进行深入细致的思想工作。“走出去”，就是到附近的工厂、农村去，学习工农群众落实毛主席最新指示的立场、态度、观点，从而坚定到农村去接受贫下中农再教育的信心；到家庭、街道去，做好学生家长的思想工作，达到学校、家长、本人三同意。“请进来”，就是请老工人、老贫农讲“三史”，做忆苦思甜报告，激发广大革命师生对刘少奇及其同伙的阶级仇恨，加深对毛主席最新指示的理解。初中应届毕业生张小玲，过去认为父母只有自己这个独生女，舍不得离开家。在学习班里，她联系自己苦难的家史，深有感触地说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！如今毛主席号召知识青年到农村去，我坚决听毛主席的话。”她说到做到，立即报名到农村安家落户。在她的带动下，许多学生都消除了“等一等”的思想，纷纷报名上山下乡。
    与此同时，宣传队还利用已经去农村安家落户的学生的来信，进行宣传教育；请送学生去农村安家落户的工人、解放军同志，介绍贫下中农热情接待的生动事迹。这些，都使即将奔赴农村安家落户的应届毕业生深受鼓舞，纷纷报名，到农村去，到边疆去，到祖国最需要的地方去。
