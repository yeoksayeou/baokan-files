The Iraqi News Agency and the Arab Lawyers Union have each issued comments and statements protesting the United Nations' forced passage, twenty-one years ago, of the so-called Palestinian partition resolution under the manipulation of American-led imperialism. They also pointed out that the Palestinian issue can only be resolved through the armed struggle of the Palestinian people.

The Iraqi News Agency published a commentary on November 30 stating: "We believe that the methods of peaceful resolution, the unjust resolutions of the Security Council, and the activities of Jarring are extensions of the imperialist conspiracy against the Arab people's existence. Our heroic people are determined to throw all the methods of peaceful resolution and unjust resolutions, from the United Nations' partition resolution to last year's Security Council resolution, as well as the activities of Jarring, into the dustbin of history."

The commentary said that today, the Arab people are conducting a bloody revolution with great resolve and determination. They reject all the deals in the "peaceful resolution" plans because these deals merely mean surrendering to the evil imperialist conspiracy, allowing the Nazi gang to manipulate the fate of our people and plunder the wealth of Palestine.

The commentary emphasized that the Palestinian issue cannot be resolved through resolutions controlled by American imperialism in the United Nations and the Security Council, nor through negotiations, political speeches, or conspiracies. It can only be resolved through the armed struggle of our people on the land of Palestine.

The commentary said that the Arab people have chosen the path of armed struggle until they liberate all the occupied Arab territories from the hands of the enemies of the people—the evil invaders.

The Arab Lawyers Union issued a statement in Cairo on November 29 regarding the United Nations' passage of the so-called Palestinian partition resolution twenty-one years ago. The statement pointed out that the Arab people should not harbor any illusions about the United Nations. The statement said that the Arab people are increasingly convinced that Israel is using the United Nations and its "envoy" Jarring to persist in its demands and consolidate its occupation of Arab lands.

The statement emphasized the necessity of liberating the occupied Arab lands, stating: "The only path to liberation is the armed struggle that the Palestinian guerrillas are waging against Zionist aggression and Israeli occupation."

    伊拉克通讯社和阿拉伯律师联合会发表评论和声明
    巴勒斯坦问题只有通过武装斗争才能解决
    抗议联合国强行通过的所谓巴勒斯坦分治的决议
    新华社四日讯　伊拉克通讯社和阿拉伯律师联合会分别发表评论和声明，抗议二十一年前联合国在以美国为首的帝国主义操纵下强行通过所谓巴勒斯坦分治的决议，并且指出巴勒斯坦问题只有通过巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争的道路才能得到解决。
    伊拉克通讯社十一月三十日发表评论说：“我们认为和平解决方法、安理会的不公正的决议和雅林的谈判，是帝国主义反对阿拉伯人生存的阴谋的延伸。我们英雄的人民决心把从（联合国关于巴勒斯坦）分治的决议起到去年安理会决议为止的一切和平解决方法和不公正的决议，以及雅林的活动，统统抛到历史的字纸篓里去。”
    评论说，今天，阿拉伯人民以巨大的毅力和决心进行流血革命，他们拒绝了关于“和平解决”方案中的一切交易，因为这些交易仅仅意味着屈服于帝国主义的罪恶阴谋，使纳粹匪帮得以摆布我们人民的命运，掠夺巴勒斯坦的财富。
    评论强调说，巴勒斯坦问题不可能通过被美帝控制的联合国和安理会的决议来解决，也不可能通过谈判、政治演说或阴谋来解决，而只能通过我们人民在巴勒斯坦土地上的武装斗争道路才能得到解决。
    评论说，阿拉伯人民选择了武装斗争的道路，直到从人民的敌人——罪恶的入侵者手中收复全部被占领的阿拉伯领土为止。
    阿拉伯律师联合会十一月二十九日就二十一年前联合国通过所谓巴勒斯坦分治决议在开罗发表一项声明指出，阿拉伯人民不应当对联合国抱任何幻想。声明说，阿拉伯人民日益确信，以色列正在利用联合国及其“特使”雅林来坚持自己的要求，巩固它对阿拉伯土地的占领。
    声明在强调必须解放被占领的阿拉伯土地时指出：“取得解放的唯一途径是巴勒斯坦游击队正在对犹太复国主义侵略和以色列占领进行的武装斗争。”
