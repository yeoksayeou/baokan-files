	Sending Youth to the Countryside, Cadres Must Take the Lead
	Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Hangzhou Steel Plant, Shang Yufu

	"Sending educated youth to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is very necessary." Chairman Mao's latest directive is a long-term strategy to prevent and combat revisionism, a thousand-year plan to ensure the revolution. It is the fundamental path to the ideological transformation of educated youth, to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. It is the greatest concern, support, and care for the educated youth. At the same time, it is the greatest education, encouragement, and motivation for us cadres. Chairman Mao's latest directive speaks directly to our hearts.

	This year, my eldest child graduated from Hangzhou Foreign Language School. Initially, he was reluctant to leave the scenic beauty of Hangzhou and wanted to find a job in the city, not wanting to go to the countryside. At that time, I also felt a bit reluctant to let him go to the countryside or the border areas. However, thinking of Chairman Mao's teaching, "The successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are grown in the midst of the people, tempered in the great wind and storms of revolution," and reflecting on the education I received during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the changes in my child over the years, I deeply felt that sending educated youth to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is indeed very necessary.

	I joined the work in 1946 and followed Chairman Mao in the revolution. Under the nurturing of great Mao Zedong Thought, I did not become detached from the masses, and my life was relatively hard. However, after liberation, as my position rose and my salary increased, I began to seek comfort in life, did not participate in labor for a long time, became seriously detached from the masses, and did not study Mao Zedong Thought seriously. My ideology and style gradually changed. Fortunately, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, saved me. As for my child, due to the poisoning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi in the old school, he returned home unwilling to participate in labor, even unwilling to wash his own clothes. After eating, he either played ball, hunted birds, or fished, living a life of being fed and clothed without lifting a finger. He did not understand what exploitation was, what class was. If this continued, wouldn't he become a revisionist! Seeing these changes in my child, I was very pained. In the past, it was "raising children to support old age," but now we cadres must teach our children to prevent revisionism. Youth are the future of the country. To cultivate them into successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, we should let them go to the harsh border areas and countryside, roll in the mud, and undergo a thorough transformation, which is our responsibility as parents and true care for our children.

	To fundamentally help my child raise his class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, my wife and I repeatedly gave him class education. Once, during a bitter meal, I told my child the bitter family history of the old society. I was born into a poor family and lived a life worse than cattle in the old society. Very early, I was forced to work as a laborer for landlords and capitalists. Because of not having enough to eat and wear, my father and younger brother starved to death, and my younger sister was forced to flee and wander. The East is red, the sun rises, Chairman Mao saved our whole family from the sea of bitterness and stood up as masters. The children listened to the bitter and sweet memories and were all moved to tears. Then I told my child, "We cannot forget our roots after liberation. In the past, none of our ancestors in our family had the chance to study. Now you have the opportunity to study, which is thanks to Chairman Mao. You should listen to Chairman Mao's words and go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants." His mother also told him, "You have grown up in sugar water and should go to a harsh environment to temper and grow." I also used my personal experience to criticize the traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "study to become an official" theory, making him realize that whether or not to go to the countryside is a major issue of the two-line struggle, a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao. After repeated education, his ideological consciousness gradually improved, and he firmly expressed his willingness to listen to Chairman Mao's words, go to the countryside, go to harsh places, and become a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

	Just a few days ago, when I was preparing Chairman Mao's precious books and luggage for my child to go to the countryside, Chairman Mao's latest directive was issued. Our family was very excited and spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The next day, my child happily set off for the countryside in Heilongjiang to settle down.

    送子下乡，干部要带头
    杭州钢铁厂革委会副主任　尚玉福
    “知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。”毛主席的最新指示，是防修反修的百年大计，千年大计，是实现知识青年思想革命化，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本途径，是对知识青年的最大关怀，最大支持，最大爱护，同时也是对我们广大干部的最大教育，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。毛主席的最新指示，字字句句说到我们的心坎上。
    今年，我的大孩子在杭州外语学校毕业了。开始他留恋杭州这个山青水秀的地方，想在城市找个工作，不愿到农村去。当时，我也有点舍不得他到农村或边疆去。可是，一想到毛主席“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的”的教导，联想到我在这场无产阶级文化大革命中受到的教育和孩子几年来的变化，深深感到：知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农再教育，确实很有必要。
    我一九四六年参加工作，紧跟着毛主席干革命。在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，没有脱离群众，生活上也较艰苦。但是解放以后，官大了，薪水也多了，生活上图安逸，长期不参加劳动，严重脱离群众，学习毛泽东思想也不认真，思想、作风逐渐变了。多亏毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命挽救了我。而我的孩子呢？由于在旧学校受到大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，回到家里，不想参加劳动，连自己的衣服也不愿意洗。吃饱饭不是打球，就是打鸟、钓鱼，过着饭来张口、衣来伸手的生活。不懂得什么是剥削，什么是阶级，照此下去，那不是要变修吗！看到孩子的这些变化，我十分痛心。过去，是“养儿防老”，现在咱们当干部的就要教子防修。青年是国家的未来，要培养他们成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，应该让他们到艰苦的边疆和农村去，滚一身泥巴，来一个脱胎换骨的改造，这才是我们作父母应尽的责任，也是我们对孩子的真正爱护。
    为了从根本上帮助孩子提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，我和他的妈妈就对孩子反复进行阶级教育。有一次，在吃忆苦饭时，我把旧社会的苦难家史讲给孩子听。我出生在贫苦家庭，在旧社会过着牛马不如的生活。我很早就被迫给地主、资本家当苦力，由于吃不饱，穿不暖，我父亲和弟弟活活饿死，妹妹被迫逃荒流浪他乡。东方红，太阳升，毛主席他老人家把我们全家救出苦海，翻身作了主人。孩子们听了忆苦思甜，都激动地流下了眼泪。接着我又对孩子说：“我们翻身不能忘本。过去我们家祖祖辈辈都没有人念过书，你现在能念书，这是托毛主席的福。你要听毛主席的话，到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。”他妈妈也对他说：你是在糖水里长大的，应该到艰苦的环境里去锻炼成长。我还用自己的亲身体会，多次和他一道狠狠地批判了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇宣扬的“读书做官论”，使他认识到愿意不愿意到农村去，是两条路线斗争的大问题，是忠不忠于毛主席的大问题。经过多次教育，他的思想觉悟逐步地提高了，坚决表示要听毛主席的话，到农村去，到艰苦的地方去，做毛主席的好战士。
    前几天，正当我为孩子准备毛主席的宝书和下乡行装的时候，毛主席的最新指示发表了。我们全家听了非常激动，情不自禁地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！第二天，我孩子就愉快地奔赴黑龙江农村安家落户去了。
