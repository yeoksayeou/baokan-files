The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China handed a note of protest to the Burmese Embassy in China on the 16th, strongly protesting the Burmese government's illegal arrest and murder of overseas Chinese, persecution of Chinese border residents, and intentional worsening of relations between the two countries.

The note stated: Recently, the Burmese government has been massacring innocent, patriotic overseas Chinese and persecuting and arresting Chinese border residents in the China-Burma border region. On October 25, Burmese troops stationed in Nankang illegally arrested Chen Caijing, a Chinese teacher who had lived in the area for generations, and murdered her that night, throwing her body into the Ruili River. Her body was not found in the river west of Nankang until November 18. The Burmese side has not dared to announce this brutal murder of an innocent overseas Chinese.

Prior to this incident, the Burmese government had illegally arrested Chen Dalong, a Chinese teacher in Nankang, and Chinese border resident Xu Jingyao, among others, and their whereabouts remain unknown.

The note pointed out: The Chinese government expresses great indignation at the Burmese government's serious crime of murdering patriotic overseas Chinese Chen Caijing and persecuting Chinese border residents, and strongly protests to the Burmese government.

The note said: Since the Burmese government's mad anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign last June, which involved large-scale arrests and massacres of patriotic overseas Chinese across the country, the Chinese government has repeatedly protested and negotiated, demanding that the Burmese government release all the innocent, patriotic overseas Chinese who have been arrested and stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes. However, the Burmese government has turned a deaf ear and instead intensified its actions. Now it has even developed to the point of illegally arresting and massacring innocent overseas Chinese and Chinese border residents in the China-Burma border region. This is another serious step by the Burmese government to intentionally worsen relations between the two countries and stubbornly pursue an anti-China and anti-Chinese policy.

The note concluded: The Chinese government firmly protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and demands that the Burmese government give an explanation for the murder of Chen Caijing, unconditionally release all the arrested patriotic overseas Chinese and Chinese border residents, and stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes.

    缅甸政府杀害华侨迫害中国边民蓄意进一步恶化两国关系
    我外交部向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议
    中国政府坚决保护华侨正当权益　缅甸政府必须停止一切反华罪行
    新华社十七日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十六日把一件抗议照会交给缅甸驻华大使馆，就缅甸政府非法抓捕和杀害华侨、迫害中国边民，蓄意进一步恶化两国关系的严重罪行，向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说：最近，缅甸政府在中缅边境地区残杀无辜爱国华侨，迫害和逮捕中国边民。十月二十五日驻在南坎的缅甸军队非法抓捕了世代旅居该地的华侨教师陈彩英，并于当晚杀害了她，将尸体投入瑞丽江，到十一月十八日才在南坎以西的江中发现。缅方一直不敢公布这一残酷杀害无辜华侨的罪行。
    在此事件以前，缅甸政府曾先后非法抓捕了南坎华侨教师陈大龙和中国边民许景尧等人，至今下落不明。
    照会指出：中国政府对于缅方残杀爱国华侨陈彩英，迫害中国边民的严重罪行，表示极大的愤慨，并向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说：自去年六月缅甸政府疯狂反华排华，在全国各地大规模逮捕和屠杀爱国华侨以来，中国政府曾多次抗议和交涉，要求缅甸政府释放所有被捕的无辜爱国华侨，停止一切反华排华罪行。但缅甸政府置若罔闻，反而变本加厉，现在竟发展到在中缅边境地区非法抓捕和残杀无辜的华侨和中国边民，这是缅甸政府蓄意进一步恶化两国关系，顽固推行反华排华政策的又一严重步骤。
    照会最后说：中国政府坚决保护华侨的正当权益，要求缅甸政府对杀害华侨陈彩英事件作出交代，无条件释放所有被捕的爱国华侨和中国边民，停止一切反华排华罪行。
