The secretary of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Osvaldo Beccar, recently published an article in the party's organ, *Nuova Unità*, enthusiastically praising the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The article, titled "The Development of the Party," states that recent international events have shown that class struggle is intensifying worldwide. The struggles of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing and increasingly shaking the crumbling rule of imperialism led by the United States. Workers, peasants, and revolutionary students are now more than ever engaged in struggle against the oppressive and brutal system based on exploitation and violence. They understand that only through uncompromising struggle can socialism be achieved.

The article says: "The deception and betrayal of revisionism are increasingly exposed. The Khrushchev clique, which usurped the leadership of the CPSU, has revealed its social-imperialist nature and is increasingly identical to U.S. imperialism. This clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism in all respects, is attempting to divide the world." The article condemns the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionists and their accomplices. The article states that they "have nothing in common with socialism and Marxism-Leninism; they do not represent the interests of the working class; they are genuine traitors standing on the side of the bourgeoisie."

The article says that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is achieving comprehensive victory in China, provides a great lesson for the international proletariat. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution exposes the bourgeois nature of revisionism based on individualism and exposes the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

The article points out that contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—is the powerful weapon that can unite the struggle against imperialism, capitalism, and revisionism under the leadership of the working class.

The article further emphasizes that "'The working class must lead everything,' in our current conditions, this means that Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, must lead everything. Therefore, today, Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental dividing line in the international arena between those who stand on the side of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples and those who stand on the side of the bourgeoisie."

The article analyzes the heroic struggles of the Italian working class. The article says: "All revolutionaries today must accept the leadership of the working class and working-class thought, especially students."

The article says that in Italy, "due to the intensification of the struggle, the unity of the working class and revolutionaries must be guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought alone." The article points out that today, to depart from Mao Zedong Thought and betray Mao Zedong Thought means to depart from and betray the working class.

The article says: "In the past two years, our party has made a great leap forward, established contact with the masses, accumulated experience, and advanced the process of building a Marxist-Leninist party, increasingly becoming the conscious, organized, and true vanguard of the Italian working class."

The article says that it is precisely because of these achievements and the development of class struggle in our country and the world that the party is facing some new problems. We should not forget that class struggle always reflects within the party.

The article says: "When a revolutionary party becomes stronger, the bourgeoisie always attempts to sabotage it, either by using external violence or by infiltrating its agents into the party to strike the party with 'sugar-coated bullets,' leading the party to the capitalist road and the road of revisionism and betrayal through 'peaceful evolution.'" The article emphasizes the need to be constantly aware of the danger of non-proletarian thought within the party and to struggle against non-proletarian thought within the party. "To do this, we need a powerful weapon, which is Mao Zedong Thought. It should be repeatedly emphasized that today, Mao Zedong Thought is the concentrated expression of the thought and leadership of the working class."

The article concludes by saying that the great task before all comrades today is to consolidate the entire party on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in thought and practice, to expose and eliminate revisionist and non-proletarian thought within the party.

    意共（马列）中央书记撰文热情赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想是反帝反修的强大武器
    强调在实践中运用毛泽东思想，把意共（马列）建设成为有觉悟有组织的先锋队
    新华社七日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会书记处书记奥斯瓦尔多·贝契，不久前在意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《新团结报》上发表文章，热情赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想。
    这篇题为《党的发展》的文章说，最近国际上发生的一系列事件，说明阶级斗争在全世界日趋尖锐。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的斗争，正在蓬勃发展，并越来越震撼着以美国为首的帝国主义摇摇欲坠的统治。工人阶级、农民和革命学生，今天已经越来越同建立在剥削和暴力基础上的压迫和残忍的制度进行斗争。他们懂得，只有进行不妥协的斗争，才能实现社会主义。
    文章说：“修正主义的欺骗和背叛也日益暴露。篡夺了苏共领导权的赫鲁晓夫集团，已暴露了它的社会帝国主义的本性，越来越同美帝一模一样。这个集团同美帝在一切方面实行‘共处’，企图瓜分世界。”文章谴责苏修及其同伙的叛卖行径。文章说，他们“已经同社会主义、马克思列宁主义毫无共同之处，他们不代表工人阶级的利益，他们是站在资产阶级一边的地地道道的叛徒。”
    文章说，正在中国取得全面胜利的无产阶级文化大革命，为国际无产阶级提供了伟大的教益。无产阶级文化大革命揭露了建立在私字基础上的修正主义的资产阶级本性，揭露了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    文章指出，当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，是唯一能够把反对帝国主义、反对资本主义、反对修正主义的斗争统一在工人阶级领导下的强大武器。
    文章接着强调说，“‘工人阶级必须领导一切’，在我们所处的条件下，这意味着，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想必须领导一切。因此，今天，毛泽东思想是在国际上区分谁是站在无产阶级和被压迫人民一边，谁是站在资产阶级一边的根本分界线。”
    文章分析了意大利工人阶级的英勇斗争。文章说：“所有的革命者今天都必须接受工人阶级和工人阶级思想的领导，特别是对学生来说更是如此。”
    文章说，在意大利“由于斗争的尖锐化，工人阶级和革命者的联合，必须以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为唯一的指针。”文章指出，今天，脱离毛泽东思想，背叛毛泽东思想，就意味着脱离和背叛工人阶级。
    文章说：“在这两年里，我们党有了一个巨大的跃进，同群众取得了联系，积累了经验，把马克思列宁主义党的建设过程推向前进，越来越成为意大利工人阶级的有觉悟的、有组织的、真正的先锋队。”
    文章说，正是由于这些成就，也由于阶级斗争在我国和世界上的发展，党面临着一些新的问题。我们不应该忘记，阶级斗争总是要在党内反映出来的。
    文章说：“当革命党日益加强时，资产阶级就总是企图破坏它，或者从外部施用暴力或者使它的代理人混入党内，以便用‘糖衣炮弹’来打击党，让党通过‘和平演变’而走上资本主义道路，走上修正主义和背叛的道路。”文章强调，必须随时意识到党内的非无产阶级思想的危险性，必须同党内的非无产阶级思想作斗争。“为了做到这一点，我们要有一个强大的武器，这就是毛泽东思想。应当反复指出，今天，毛泽东思想是工人阶级思想和领导的集中表现。”
    文章最后说，在毛泽东思想的基础上巩固全党，在思想上和实践中高举毛泽东思想红旗，揭发和铲除党内的修正主义的、非无产阶级的思想，这是今天摆在全体同志面前的伟大任务。
