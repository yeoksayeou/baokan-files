Title: Cultivating Successors According to the Wishes of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

I have been teaching as a locally hired teacher in our village primary school since 1965. Over the past three years, I have come to realize through practice that the greatest benefit of moving the primary school to the production brigade is that it allows us to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause according to the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the past, our brigade's state-run primary school, under the control of the capitalist roaders in the old educational system, was detached from workers and peasants, detached from the masses, and detached from proletarian politics. Some children, after studying for a few years, could not accomplish anything. If you asked them to be an accountant, they couldn't use an abacus; if you sent them to work in the fields, they couldn't complete a day's work in three days; if you asked them to clean the latrines, they would shake their heads in fear of losing face.

In 1965, the PLA comrades who participated in the Four Cleanups work team saw this with their own eyes and took it to heart. They firmly supported the poor and lower-middle peasants in managing the school and established two locally hired classes managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants also selected me, a graduate of junior high school who had worked in the countryside, to be the teacher. They spoke to me earnestly, saying, "This school is run by us poor and lower-middle peasants. You must definitely cultivate successors for us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

Over the years, the poor and lower-middle peasants have always been concerned about the growth of the children. At the beginning, there were no desks and chairs for classes, so the poor and lower-middle peasants voluntarily came to the school to build mud platforms and also voluntarily donated money to buy portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao to send to the school. The poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely abolished textbooks that propagated revisionist goods and made the "Three Articles" the basic teaching materials. The poor and lower-middle peasants also often organized the children to participate in the Cultural Revolution. Many children became little warriors in the struggle against the enemy. At the same time, the poor and lower-middle peasants often went to the school and home to understand the situation of the children and timely educate the children. A child, influenced by the poison of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's "reading books to become an official" theory, had picked up some unhealthy things. The bitter and deep-hating Auntie Zhu went to the school to remind the children of the bitterness and sweetness, greatly raising the children's class consciousness. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants listed class education as the main course in teaching and asked me to talk about it every day and at all times, so that the children would forever hate the old society and forever love Chairman Mao, and establish the idea of studying for the revolution.

After the primary school was moved to the production brigade, it fundamentally overcame the phenomenon of the past state-run schools being "detached from three things," and could closely combine teaching with the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. It was done so that whatever the community members did, it was taught; whatever the poor and lower-middle peasants needed, it was taught. When the community members weeded, the children were taught to weed; when they dug ditches for vegetables, they were taught to dig ditches for vegetables, cultivating the children's love for labor from a young age. We also, according to the requirements of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the needs of the production team, invited experienced accountants to teach the students how to write notes, how to record work points, and use the abacus.

Over the years, under the management of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the students in the two locally hired classes have higher consciousness than those in the state-run primary school. They love the collective and love labor. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The children in the locally hired classes can write when they pick up a pen, and they can pick up manure when they carry a basket. They are both little community members and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. We are very pleased from the bottom of our hearts."

### 按照贫下中农的心愿培养接班人

    按照贫下中农的心愿培养接班人
    我是从一九六五年开始在本村小学当民办教师的。三年来，我在实践中体会到：把小学下放到大队来办最大的好处是，能够按照贫下中农的心愿，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    过去我们大队的公办小学，在旧文教系统走资派的把持下，脱离工农，脱离群众，脱离无产阶级政治。有的孩子念了几年书，啥也办不成。叫他当会计，不会打算盘；下地去干活，三天顶不了一个工；叫他掏大粪，摇头怕丢人。
    一九六五年，参加四清工作队的解放军同志，把这件事看在眼里，记在心上，坚决支持贫下中农管理学校，成立了两个由贫下中农管理的民办班。贫下中农还选我这个在农村劳动的高小毕业生当了老师。他们语重心长地对我说：“这学校可是咱贫下中农办的，一定要为咱贫下中农培养接班人呀！”
    几年来，贫下中农时刻关心着孩子们的成长。开始上课没有桌凳，贫下中农自动到学校动手垒泥台，还自动捐钱买毛主席像和毛主席语录送到学校。贫下中农坚决废除宣扬修正主义货色的课本，把“老三篇”作为基本教材。贫下中农还经常组织孩子们参加文化大革命。不少孩子成了对敌斗争的小闯将。同时，贫下中农还经常到学校、家庭了解孩子们的情况，及时对孩子进行教育。一个孩子由于受叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇“读书做官论”流毒的影响，沾染了一些不健康的东西，苦大仇深的朱大娘就到学校给孩子忆苦思甜，大大提高了孩子们的阶级觉悟。广大贫下中农把阶级教育列为教学的主要课程，要我天天讲，时时讲，使孩子们永远仇恨旧社会，永远热爱毛主席，树立为革命而学的思想。
    小学下放到大队后，从根本上克服了过去公办学校“三脱离”的现象，可以紧密结合阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动进行教学。做到社员干什么就教什么，贫下中农需要什么就教什么。社员锄地时，教孩子们学锄地，拉菜沟时，就教他们拉菜沟，培养孩子们从小热爱劳动。我们还根据贫下中农的要求和生产队的需要，请有经验的会计教学生怎样写便条，如何记工分，打算盘。
    几年来，在贫下中农的管理下，两个民办班的学生比公办小学的学生觉悟高，他们爱集体，爱劳动。贫下中农说：“民办班的孩子拿起笔来能写字，背起篓筐能拾粪，既是小社员，又是毛泽东思想宣传员，我们打心眼里高兴。”
