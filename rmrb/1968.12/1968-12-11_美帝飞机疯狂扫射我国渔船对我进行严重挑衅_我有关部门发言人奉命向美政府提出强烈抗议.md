	On December 5, 38 fishing boats from the communes of Qishui, Wushi, and Jianghong in Haikang County, Guangdong Province, were engaged in fishing operations in the high seas west of Basha Port, Hainan Island (19°07'N, 107°08'E). At around 1:00 PM, two U.S. warships gradually approached our fishing boats. When the U.S. ships were about one kilometer away from our fishing boats, a helicopter took off from the U.S. warship and wildly machine-gunned our Boat No. 6. This is a deliberate act by U.S. imperialism to disrupt fishing production in the high seas and threaten the lives of our fishermen. It is a pirate act and a serious provocation against our country. A spokesperson from the relevant department of our country has been instructed to strongly condemn and protest this to the U.S. government.

    美帝飞机疯狂扫射我国渔船对我进行严重挑衅
    我有关部门发言人奉命向美政府提出强烈抗议
    新华社十日讯　十二月五日，我广东省海康县企水、乌石、江洪公社所属渔船三十八艘，在我海南岛八所港以西公海海面（北纬19°07’，东经107°08’）进行捕鱼作业。十三时许，美国军舰两艘向我渔船逐渐靠近。在美舰离我渔船约一千米时，从美国军舰上起飞直升飞机一架，向我六号渔船进行疯狂扫射。这是美帝国主义蓄意破坏公海渔业生产，威胁我国渔民生命安全的海盗行为，这是对我国进行的严重挑衅。我有关部门发言人奉命就此对美国政府进行严厉谴责，并提出强烈抗议。
