I was originally the Party Branch Secretary of Tangzhu Brigade in Zhong'an Commune, Beizhen County. In February this year, I was elected by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to be the Chairman of the Commune Revolutionary Committee. I thought: I am an uneducated peasant, can I really handle the job of Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee? In the past, when I worked in the brigade, it was a small area with over a thousand people; now, working in the commune, it is a large area with eighteen brigades and over twenty thousand people. It is also a key grain-producing commune. If I don't do well, it will cause losses to the Party's cause. I was always uneasy and not at peace.

On the day the commune established the Revolutionary Committee, over ten thousand people participated in the celebration. Old poor peasant, five-guarantee household member Yang Baotang, who couldn't walk by himself, insisted on participating in the celebration to see the Revolutionary Committee. We had him sit in a chair and carry him to the venue. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants care about and support the new red political power so much. Over twenty thousand people have entrusted us with power. If we don't work hard, can we face the poor and lower-middle peasants? Can we face Chairman Mao? To carry the revolution through to the end, I decided to overcome my fear of difficulties, shoulder this heavy burden, and manage the power for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

To be revolutionary, not bureaucratic

After the establishment of the Commune Revolutionary Committee, we set up three groups: political work, production, and general affairs, and assigned thirty-four cadres to these groups. After working for a while, we encountered the "three more, three less" problem: more staff, fewer decision-makers; more sitting upstairs, fewer going down to the countryside; more reporting problems, fewer solving them concretely. Some work was passed around without being solved in time. The poor and lower-middle peasants sharply criticized this situation.

At this time, our great leader Chairman Mao issued new instructions: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." We immediately convened a standing committee meeting to study this seriously. Everyone decided to follow Chairman Mao's guidance on "streamlining personnel" in building the political power. After criticizing and repudiating our selfish thoughts and bourgeois ideas, we, on the basis of unified thinking, abolished the original three groups, reducing the number of staff from thirty-four to ten.

The number of people was reduced, but there were still twelve offices, and the masses couldn't find anyone when they came. What should we do? We discussed the issue of whether to be bureaucratic or revolutionary. Everyone agreed to move from the big courtyard to the small one, implementing the "three-in-one" office system, which serves as an office, meeting room, and dormitory.

The organization was streamlined, and the number of people was reduced, but we still had to solve one problem: whether the masses serve us or we serve the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The words and deeds of a Communist must conform to the highest standard of being in the interests of the broadest masses of the people and being supported by the broadest masses of the people." Our newly established Revolutionary Committee must "never leave the masses for a moment" and "always act in the people's interests." In the past, the commune's leadership work was done by reporting upstairs and summarizing downstairs. No matter big or small, all brigade and team cadres were called to the commune for meetings. This bureaucratic style must be firmly changed. We must go deep into the masses, hold meetings downstairs, and handle affairs downstairs. Since the establishment of the Commune Revolutionary Committee, we have only held two meetings upstairs. The rest of the meetings were held downstairs. Cadres going downstairs must do the "four brings and five together": bring Mao Zedong's works, bring luggage, bring a manure basket, bring farming tools; eat together, live together, work together, study together, and criticize and repudiate selfish thoughts together. Our approach has been widely welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres.

To be a good commander, first be a good fighter

At the beginning, we wanted to grab all the work at once, but we couldn't find a way out. We studied Chairman Mao's new instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's instructions are like a bright lamp, illuminating our way forward. They made us realize that no matter how much we grab, if we don't grab class struggle, it's all in vain. We decided to go to the places where class struggle is the most intense to set up a point of contact, planting our roots among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some people said: "You are the chairman, you have to grasp the overall situation. There is so much work in the commune, what if you leave?" I said: "'No investigation, no right to speak.' In the past, the old commune party committee had the leaders running around, and the general cadres setting up points of contact. Now we should reverse this."

Yangtai is a notorious "difficult place" with complex class struggles. As soon as we entered the village, we encountered many difficulties. At that time, I thought, everyone knows I am setting up a point of contact in Yangtai. If I don't do well, how can I explain it? With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Everything must be done in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups." "We must eliminate all weak and incompetent thoughts within our ranks. Any view that overestimates the enemy's strength and underestimates the people's strength is wrong." Chairman Mao's teachings helped me overcome selfishness, giving me courage and strength. I, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangtai Brigade, vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's new instructions, jointly studied Chairman Mao's new instructions, held various types of study classes, focused on class education, launched a revolutionary criticism, and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, finally exposing the hidden class enemies. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "This typhoon is good, it blew down the class enemies, and a new Yangtai appeared." We summarized the experience of Yangtai Brigade in fighting against the enemies and held an on-site meeting to promote it. The whole commune quickly launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism, striking down a handful of class enemies accurately and fiercely.

Through practice, we tasted the sweetness, so we decided to establish the point of contact as a system. We deeply felt that as a member of the Revolutionary Committee, no matter how much we say, it is not as good as doing it in practice. Only by setting up a point of contact in person and being a good student of the masses can we guide the overall situation. Only by being a good fighter can we be a good commander.

Not to be an official, but to make a revolution

After I came to the commune, my comrades prepared an office for me, papering the ceiling, placing a good desk, and hanging a white sign on the door with the words "Chairman's Office" in red. At first, I didn't pay much attention to this. One day, an old poor peasant came to the commune to do something and asked where the chairman was. A cadre said: "Look at the sign!" I heard this and felt bad. I thought over and over again, isn't this sign the dividing line between cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants? In the past, when I was the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade, I also felt afraid to enter the Party Secretary's office. This time, as soon as I came to the commune, I also hung a sign. Isn't this restoring the old ways and going back? Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not to be officials, but to make a revolution. We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment separate ourselves from the masses." The more I thought about it, the more I felt this was not a small matter. The next day, at the standing committee meeting, I proposed three points: first, don't use titles, just call me Wang Guizhong; second, don't hang a sign in front of my office; third, the commune's food standard should be lower, don't separate from the masses. To make a revolution and manage power, I must always be the same as the masses, achieving the "three unchanging": the same as everyone in recording work points, the same as everyone in eating the team's grain, and the same as everyone in participating in labor.

At first, I thought that running such a large area, riding a bicycle with luggage to the brigade, was also revolutionary. Later, I thought, in the past, the county's walking capitalists never left their cars when they went out. Now I don't leave my bicycle when I go out. If I continue like this, won't I also separate from the masses? Whether to be closely connected with the masses or to separate from the masses, this is not a small problem, but a big problem that affects whether the political power changes color. From then on, I no longer rode a bicycle to the brigades. I picked up the manure basket again, went deep down, and studied Mao Zedong's works with the masses and worked with them. Now, I have picked over a thousand pounds of manure. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "In the past, cadres said a word to us and we thought it was good. Now the cadres come down to pick manure and talk to us. This is really under the leadership of Chairman Mao! Such cadres managing power, we trust!"

This year, during the drought relief, the political commissar of the military unit and the chairman of the county revolutionary committee carried their luggage and walked thirty-five miles without coming to the commune, going directly to the brigade to fight the drought with the masses. He brought us the good style of the old Eighth Route Army and the good tradition of the Party's hard struggle, and also set a good example of being closely connected with the masses for us. I decided to learn from the comrades of the People's Liberation Army and their good tradition of being closely connected with the masses. Once, we went to Chentang Brigade to hold a lecture meeting. After leaving our luggage, I went to visit the poor and lower-middle peasants. There was a five-guarantee household, an old couple who were both blind. I carried a full bucket of water for them. The old woman, hearing that I was the chairman of the commune revolutionary committee, was so moved that she shed tears, saying: "You are so busy, but you still carry water for us. We should thank Chairman Mao!"

    一刻也不脱离群众　一切从人民的利益出发
    辽宁省活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子　北镇县中安公社革命委员会主任　王贵忠
    我原来是北镇县中安公社汤屯大队党支部书记，今年二月，被广大贫下中农选为公社革委会主任。我想：我是一天书没念过的大老粗，当革委会主任行吗？过去在大队工作是一小块，一千多口人；现在在公社工作是一大片，十八个大队，两万多口人，又是重点产粮社，搞不好，会给党的事业造成损失。心里嘀嘀咕咕，老是不踏实。
    公社成立革委会那天，有一万多人参加庆祝大会。老贫农、五保户杨百堂自己不能走动，还非要参加庆祝大会看一看革委会不可。我们就让他坐在椅子上，抬到会场。广大贫下中农这样关心和支持新生的红色政权，两万多人把权交给了我们，我们不好好干，能对得起贫下中农吗？能对得起毛主席吗？为了把革命进行到底，我决心克服畏难情绪，挑起这副重担子，为贫下中农掌好权、用好权。
    要革命化，不要机关化
    公社革委会成立后，设立政工、生产、总务三个组，把三十四名干部编进了各组。干了一段，出现了“三多三少”：工作人员多，管事的少；坐在上边的多，下乡的少；反映问题的多，具体解决的少。有些工作互相扯皮，不能及时解决。贫下中农对这种情况提出了尖锐的批评。
    就在这个时候，伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”我们马上召开常委会，认真进行了学习，大家都决心在政权建设上走毛主席指引的“精兵简政”的道路。经过斗私批修，在思想统一的基础上，撤销了原来的三个组，工作人员由原来的三十四人减少到十人。
    人员减了，可是还有十二个办公室，群众来了找不到人。怎么办？我们又讨论了“要机关化，还是要革命化”的问题。大家一致同意从大院搬到小院去，实行“三室合一”办公，既是办公室，又是会议室，还是寝室。
    机构精简了，人员少了，还要解决一个问题，这就是群众为我们服务，还是我们为群众服务的问题。毛主席教导我们：“共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”我们新生的革命委员会，一定要“一刻也不脱离群众”，“一切从人民的利益出发”。过去，公社领导工作是上来靠报告，下去靠汇报。不管大事小事，都把大、小队干部叫到公社开会。这种官僚主义作风，应当坚决改变。我们要深入到群众中去，会议要搬到下边去开，事要到下边去办。公社革委会成立八个多月，我们只在上面开过两次大会，其余的会都在下面开。干部下去，要做到“四带五同”：带毛主席著作，带行李，带粪筐，带农具；同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修。我们这种作法，受到广大贫下中农和基层干部的普遍欢迎。
    要当好指挥员，首先要当好战斗员
    刚开始，我们恨不得一下子把工作都抓起来，可是总忙不出个头绪来。我们学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的指示，象一盏明灯，照亮了我们前进的方向。使我们认识到，千抓万抓，不抓阶级斗争，就是瞎抓。我们决定到阶级斗争最激烈的地方去蹲点，把根扎到贫下中农中去。有的人说：“你是主任，得掌握全面，公社工作这么多，你走了怎么办？”我说：“‘没有调查就没有发言权’。过去旧公社党委是领导跑面，一般干部蹲点，现在我们要把它颠倒过来。”
    杨台是有名的“老大难”地方，阶级斗争很复杂。一进村就遇到了不少难题。当时我想，谁都知道我到杨台蹲点，要是搞不好，可怎么交代呢？带着这个问题，我学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。“我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。一切过高地估计敌人力量和过低地估计人民力量的观点，都是错误的。”毛主席的教导，促使我斗掉了“私”字，给我增添了勇气和力量。我就和杨台大队的贫下中农一起，大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席的最新指示，共同学习毛主席的最新指示，举办各种类型的学习班，狠抓阶级教育，开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，终于把暗藏的阶级敌人挖了出来。贫下中农高兴地说：“这场台风刮得好，吹垮了阶级敌人，出现了一个新杨台。”我们总结了杨台大队开展对敌斗争的经验，公社革委会召开了现场会议，进行推广，全公社很快地掀起了革命大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的新高潮。
    通过实践，我们尝到了甜头，于是决定把蹲点作为一项制度确定下来。我们深深感到，作为一个革命委员会的成员，说一千道一万，不如实际干一干。只有亲自蹲点，当好群众的学生，才能指导全面。只有当好战斗员，才能当好指挥员。
    不是要做官，而是要革命
    我到公社以后，同志们给我准备了一个办公室，糊了新顶棚，摆了一张好办公桌，门上还挂个白牌，上面写着“主任室”三个红字。开始，我对这件事也没大注意。有一天，一位老贫农到公社办事，问主任在那屋，有个干部回答说：“你看牌子嘛！”这句话我听到了，很不好受。反来复去地想，这个牌子不就是干部和贫下中农的隔离线吗？过去我当大队党支部书记，进党委书记那屋也觉得害怕。这回我刚到公社，也挂上牌子，这不是恢复老一套，走回头路吗？毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”我越想越觉得这不是一件小事。第二天，在常委会上，我提出三条：第一条，不要叫官衔，管我叫王贵忠；第二条，我的办公室门前不要挂牌子；第三条，公社伙食标准要低一点，不要脱离群众。为革命掌权，我要永远和群众一样，做到“三不变”，这就是和大家一样记工分不变，和大家一样吃队里粮不变，和大家一样参加劳动不变。
    刚到公社，我觉得跑这么一大片，骑车子驮行李下队，也算革命化了。后来我想，过去县里的走资派出门就不离汽车，现在我出门不离自行车，这样下去不一样脱离群众吗？是密切联系群众，还是脱离群众，这不是小问题，是关系政权变不变颜色的大问题。从那以后，我下队里再也不骑自行车了。重新背起粪箕子，深入下去，和群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动。现在，我已经拣了一千多斤粪。贫下中农高兴地说：“过去的干部和我们说句话就觉得不错了，现在的干部下来又是拣粪，又是谈心，真是毛主席领导的好啊！这样的干部掌权，我们信得过！”
    今年抗旱的时候，解放军团政委、县革委会主任背着行李，走了三十五里地，没到公社，就直接到大队和群众一起抗旱。他给我们带来了老八路的好作风，党的艰苦奋斗的好传统，也给我们树立了密切联系群众的好榜样。我决心学习解放军同志密切联系群众的好传统。有一次，我们到陈台大队去开讲用会，撂下行李，我就去访问贫下中农。有一个五保户，老两口都双目失明，我给他们挑了满缸水，老太太听说我是公社革委会主任，感动得掉下了眼泪，说：“你这样忙，还给我们挑水。我们要感谢毛主席啊！”
    斗争的实践，使我体会到：只有遵照毛主席的教导，“一刻也不脱离群众”，“一切从人民的利益出发”，才能保证我们永葆革命的青春，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
