The communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party reached Ganzhou Metallurgical Machinery Factory, and the entire factory was in high spirits. Many people, with tears of excitement in their eyes, repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Li Xiuquan, a worker in the machining workshop, was one of the most excited. At this moment of joy and excitement, scenes from the past flashed through his mind.

Li Shifu is an old worker who has suffered deeply. Before liberation, under the oppression of landlords and capitalists, Li Shifu had to beg on the streets from a young age and worked as a laborer at the age of ten. He yearned day and night, and finally, the red sun, Chairman Mao, came. After liberation, he entered the factory. He thought: Chairman Mao is supporting us workers, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! He voluntarily proposed several technological innovation suggestions. However, due to the long-term promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management" by the traitor, scoundrel, and scab Souchong, and the advocacy of the "theory of the backwardness of the masses," the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" in the factory cruelly suppressed, controlled, and oppressed the workers. Li Shifu's suggestions were never implemented.

As soon as the Cultural Revolution began, the workers in the factory exposed the capitalist roaders and a handful of reactionary technical "authorities," seizing the technical power from their hands. In the past two years, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the help of comrades, Li Shifu successfully completed fifteen technological innovations.

After the communiqué was issued, Li Shifu appeared even more spirited. At the rally to implement the communiqué, he angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Souchong. He said, "Souchong, this bastard, has long been promoting counter-revolutionary black goods such as 'expert management' and 'theory of the backwardness of the masses' in the factory. His purpose is to attempt to restore capitalism. We must overthrow Souchong! Otherwise, we will suffer twice the hardship and twice the bitterness!"

After the meeting, Li Shifu's emotions remained unsettled for a long time. He remembered that the milling screw rod cutting tool in the workshop was still manually operated, with low efficiency and poor product quality. He decided to innovate and give a blow to the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Souchong and the capitalist roaders in the factory, using practical actions to express his loyalty to Chairman Mao!

He acted immediately. That very night, Li Shifu began his experiments. He pondered and researched repeatedly by the lathe. Time passed moment by moment, and the tools were installed and adjusted time and time again. It was already three o'clock in the morning, but he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "We, the Chinese people, have the spirit of fighting to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore our lost territory on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand proudly among the nations of the world." He felt full of energy. He disassembled and reassembled, reassembled and disassembled, and after dozens of experiments, he finally successfully reformed the milling screw rod cutting tool, not only improving the product quality but also increasing work efficiency by fifty percent.

Inspired by the communiqué and led by Li Shifu, the workers in the entire workshop completed six technological innovations in just a few days, greatly promoting production.

    李师傅深夜炼忠心
    党的八届十二中全会公报传到了赣州冶金机械厂，全厂一片欢腾。多少人含着激动的泪花，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”金工车间的李绪权师傅是其中最激动的一个。在这欢欣鼓舞的时刻，一幕幕往事又浮现在他心头。
    李师傅是个苦大仇深的老工人。解放前在地主资本家的压榨下，李师傅从小就流浪街头要饭，十多岁就给人家打小工，他日也盼，夜也盼，好容易盼来了红太阳毛主席。解放后他进了工厂。他想：毛主席为我们工人撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！他一连主动地提出了好几项技术革新建议。可是由于大工贼刘少奇长期推行“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，鼓吹“群众落后论”，厂的走资派和反动技术“权威”对工人实行了残酷的管、卡、压，李师傅的建议一直没有实现。
    文化大革命一开始，工人就把厂里的走资派和一小撮反动技术“权威”揪了出来，把技术大权从他们手里夺过来。两年多时间里，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在同志们的协助下，李师傅就搞成了十五项技术革新。
    公报发表后，李师傅显得更加精神抖擞。在落实公报的誓师大会上，他愤怒地控诉了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的滔天罪行。他说：“刘少奇这个坏家伙长期在工厂里推行‘专家治厂’‘群众落后论’等反革命黑货，其目的就是妄图复辟资本主义。我们要打倒刘少奇！不然我们就要吃二遍苦，受二茬罪！”
    会后，李师傅的心情久久不能平静，他想起了车间里的铣螺旋棒切口工具还是手工操作，效率低，产品质量又差。他决心来一次革新，再给大工贼刘少奇和厂里的走资派当头一棒，用实际行动向毛主席敬献忠心！
    说干就干，当晚李师傅就进行了试验。他在车床旁反复琢磨，反复研究。时间过了一刻又一刻，工具装了一次又一次。已经是夜里三点多钟了，但他想到毛主席“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力”的教导，就感到浑身是劲。他拆了又装，装了又拆，经过几十次的试验，终于把铣螺旋棒切口工具改革成功，不仅提高了产品的质量，而且提高了工作效率百分之五十。
    在公报的鼓舞下，在李师傅的带动下，全车间工人在短短几天内就搞成了六项技术革新，大大地促进了生产。
