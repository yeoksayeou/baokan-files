More than 50,000 high school and middle school graduates and over 10,000 university graduates from Tianjin have left their schools and headed to farms or rural areas, resolutely taking the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Students from old-style schools, the majority or a large majority, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have made inventions and creations, but they need to be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers under the leadership of the correct line to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." The broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, and urban residents in Tianjin have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They deeply understand that sending educated youth to the countryside to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers is a long-term strategy to prevent and combat revisionism, and is the fundamental way to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. They expressed their determination to implement Chairman Mao's instructions and do a good job in sending educated youth to the countryside.

Various schools, targeting the active thoughts of the graduates, held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They invited old workers and poor peasants from the old society to educate the students with their own bitter experiences. Many schools also organized students to visit the "Tianjin Three Stone Class Education Exhibition" and launched extensive "Remembering Bitterness and Thinking Sweetness" activities. On this basis, they further deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi, and eliminated the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts such as "reading books to become officials," "all professions are inferior, only reading is superior," "those who work with their brains rule, those who work with their hands are ruled," "going to the countryside for gold plating," and "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" advocated by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. Recently, 165 university graduates from Tianjin University in Hebei Province resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call, preparing to settle down in the countryside. They said: "We study not to become officials, but for the revolution. We will follow Chairman Mao's words for life, be ordinary peasants for life, and build a new socialist countryside with our own hands."

Doing a good job for the graduates' parents is an important link in mobilizing graduates to settle down in the countryside. Tianjin's revolutionary committees at various levels attach great importance to this work. Many factories, schools, and neighborhoods have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with graduates, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary parents participating. Many students' parents have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, criticized various erroneous thoughts, and actively supported their children in settling down in the countryside.

After the graduates went to the countryside, they were warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many production teams' poor and lower-middle peasants prepared houses and production tools such as hoes and shoulder poles for them. Many poor and lower-middle peasants also presented Mao Zedong's works to the educated youth who went to the countryside to settle down, encouraging them to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary family members of the Beijing New China Printing Factory have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, written a resolution, and expressed their loyalty to Chairman Mao, sending their children to the countryside to settle down with revolutionary enthusiasm.

    坚决执行毛主席伟大指示，走和贫下中农相结合的道路
    天津五万多大中学校毕业生奔赴农村
    广大毕业生说：我们读书不是为了当官，而是为了革命，我们要一辈子听毛主席的话，当一辈子普通农民
    据新华社天津二十三日电　遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，天津市已有四万多名高、初中毕业生和一万多名大学毕业生，离开学校，奔赴农场或农村，坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”天津市广大工人、贫下中农、革命干部、革命师生、街道居民，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，深刻地认识到，知识青年走与工农兵相结合的道路，接受工农兵的再教育，是防修反修的百年大计，千年大计，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本途径。他们表示，要认真落实毛主席的指示，做好知识青年上山下乡的工作。各学校针对毕业生的活思想，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，请旧社会苦大仇深的老工人、老贫农用自己在旧社会的苦难家史教育学生。许多学校还组织学生参观了“天津市三条石阶级教育展览会”，发动学生广泛开展忆苦思甜活动。在这个基础上，他们进一步深入地批判了大叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，肃清大叛徒刘少奇所宣扬的“读书做官”、“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”、“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”、“下乡镀金”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等反革命修正主义思想。天津河北大学最近有一百六十五名大学毕业生坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，准备到农村去安家落户。他们说：我们读书不是为了当官，而是为了革命，我们要一辈子听毛主席的话，当一辈子普通农民，用自己的双手建设社会主义的新农村。
    做好毕业生家长的工作，是动员毕业生到农村安家落户的一个重要环节。天津市各级革命委员会很重视这项工作。许多工厂、学校、街道举办了有毕业生、革命教师、革命家长参加的三结合的毛泽东思想学习班。许多学生家长学习了毛主席的最新指示，批判了各种错误思想，积极支持自己的子女到农村去安家落户。
    广大毕业生到农村以后，受到了贫下中农的热烈欢迎，许多生产队的贫下中农给他们准备好了房子和锄头、扁担等生产用具。许多贫下中农还向下乡落户的知识青年赠送毛主席著作，鼓励他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。（附图片）
