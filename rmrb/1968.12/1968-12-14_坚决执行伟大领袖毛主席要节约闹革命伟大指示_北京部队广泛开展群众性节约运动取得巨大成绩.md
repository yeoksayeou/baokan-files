In the guidance of the series of latest directives from the great leader Chairman Mao, and under the inspiration of the great situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Beijing Military Region have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to save and make revolution. They have extensively and deeply carried out a mass savings movement. By carrying out this movement, the troops have further tempered their hearts of limitless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, promoted the revolutionization of their thinking, carried forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and achieved tremendous results in thrift.

Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, they consciously practice thrift and manage all affairs frugally.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Beijing Military Region resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's brilliant directives on saving and making revolution and further saving and making revolution. They consciously practiced thrift in all aspects and managed all affairs frugally.

In terms of expenditure, various units strictly followed policies and regulations, calculated meticulously, practiced thrift, and strove to do more with less. This year, various units have reduced and cut down their expenditures, with administrative and business expenses alone reduced by 30%. The various tasks of the units have not been affected, and some tasks have been done better than before.

In terms of saving coal, the reform of stoves has been universally carried out. Last winter and this spring, a large amount of heating coal was saved, accounting for 30% of the standard consumption, exceeding the total coal saved in the past four years. Cooking coal consumption has been greatly reduced in most units, with some units reducing from the standard of one jin per person per day to one or two liang. They also promoted the experience of modifying boilers. This year, the entire unit has modified and reduced 270 boilers, reduced 300 stokers, and saved 26,000 tons of coal. A certain unit used local methods to successfully create more than ten types of earthen stoves and earthen firewalls, saving 8,400 iron stoves, 50,000 chimneys, and 2,500 tons of coal.

In terms of construction, many units relied on their own efforts, adapted to local conditions, used local materials, and built their own houses. Last year and this year, in completing the construction tasks, the cost per square meter was reduced from the specified 40 yuan to about 25 yuan. A certain artillery regiment built houses, hired only a few skilled workers, and did the bricks, tiles, cement, sand, and stones themselves. They built the houses themselves, saving 190,000 yuan. A certain unit carried forward the "Yan'an style," built their own earthen cave-style warehouses, and used only 7 to 8 yuan per square meter.

In terms of military-run industries, they followed the great leader Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, striving for strength, frugal management, and hard struggle, and rapidly and high-quality built some small and medium-sized industries, including paper, fertilizer, cement, salt, ore, explosives, wood processing, and food processing. They not only produced products for the army's own needs and for equal exchange with the state, supporting national construction, but also allowed the broad masses of soldiers, officers, workers, and family members to take turns working in the factories and receive training. A certain division built a paper mill with a daily output of 5 to 7 tons of offset paper for printing Chairman Mao's works in just 105 days, saving an investment of more than 200,000 yuan. A certain unit built a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 12,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate in just five months, reducing the cost by 19%.

In terms of construction, engineering units insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide construction, mobilized and relied on the masses, broke old rules and habits, carried out technological innovations, and completed engineering tasks exceeding the quota year after year, with material consumption decreasing year by year and costs decreasing year by year.

The entire unit also extensively and deeply carried out mass self-repair, self-made, recycling, and technological innovation activities. Since this year, more than 200 ten thousand yuan have been saved for the state. Some units' construction troops consciously repaired old shoes, saving a large number of shoes. Most companies can repair and make general tools and equipment themselves. This year alone, more than 150,000 yuan have been saved by repairing and making parts. A certain engineering unit also made 80 slope climbers, greatly reducing the labor intensity and saving labor.

Saving and making revolution is an important part of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and is a practical action of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The experience of the Beijing Military Region in carrying out the mass savings movement is:

First, all levels of party committees have taken the study, publicity, and implementation of Chairman Mao's great directive to save and make revolution as an important part of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have organized the entire unit to study Chairman Mao's latest directives, combined with carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, holding study classes, lectures, on-site meetings, exhibitions, and grasping typical examples and setting models, repeatedly publicizing and constantly educating, so that the broad masses of soldiers and officers have greatly raised their understanding of the importance of saving and making revolution. Soldiers say: "Saving is not just about saving a few dollars, but about whether the army holds high what banner, stands in what queue, whether it seriously implements the great leader Chairman Mao's directives, and with whom to go. It is a big issue." The army's understanding has been raised, and the consciousness of practicing thrift has been strengthened, and moving deeds of saving and making revolution have emerged in large numbers.

Second, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have raised the issue of thrift to the height of being limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and the people, and regarded saving one fen of money, one degree of electricity, one grain of rice, and one piece of coal as the practical action of implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great directives, and as a concrete manifestation of wholeheartedly serving the people and never leaving the masses. A certain regiment's 8th Company, while on duty in Tianjin, sifted more than 30,000 jin of coal from the discarded coal slag heap of a nearby factory, using it to boil water and cook, and did not burn a single piece of good coal provided by the state in half a year. Soldiers say: "Picking up a piece of coal is picking up a bit of 'public,' and it is offering a bit of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao."

Third, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the troops, and resolutely mobilize and rely on the masses, greatly mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm and creativity. This point is well grasped, and many problems can be solved satisfactorily. Some units have difficulty getting water, so they dig wells themselves. Some units have difficulty with housing, so they build their own. Engineering units do not complain when they encounter difficulties, do not ask for help, do not wait, repair tools themselves when they break, make their own equipment when they lack it, and consciously calculate meticulously and manage frugally everywhere. Comrades in the logistics department have deeply felt: "In the past, business departments were lone wolves, cold and desolate, with piles of difficulties; now, mobilizing the masses, pooling wisdom, hot and lively, problems are easy to solve."

    新华社十三日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在全国无产阶级文化大革命一片大好形势的鼓舞下，人民解放军北京部队广大指战员坚决响应毛主席要节约闹革命的伟大号召，广泛深入地开展了群众性的节约运动。深入开展这一运动，使部队进一步锤炼了无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了思想革命化，发扬了我党我军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，勤俭节约取得了巨大成绩。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，自觉地厉行节约，勤俭办一切事业
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，北京部队广大指战员坚决执行毛主席关于要节约闹革命和要进一步节约闹革命的光辉指示，自觉地在各个方面厉行节约，勤俭办一切事业。
    在经费开支方面，各部队坚决执行政策、规定，精打细算，厉行节约，力求少花钱多办事。今年，各部队都压缩、削减了经费开支，其中行政事业经费一项，压缩了百分之三十，部队各项工作不仅没受影响，有些事情比过去办得更好了。
    在节约煤炭方面，普遍开展了改革炉灶活动。去冬今春节约了大量取暖用煤，占标准消耗量的百分之三十，超过了以往四年节煤的总和。炊事用煤，绝大多数单位都有很大降低，有的单位由标准规定每人每天一斤降到一、二两。他们还推广了改装锅炉的经验，今年全部队已改装和减少锅炉二百七十多台，减少司炉工三百多名，可节煤两万六千吨。某部用土办法创制成功十余种土炉和土火墙，共节约了铁炉八千四百个，烟筒五万节，煤炭两千五百多吨。
    在营建方面，许多部队自力更生，因地制宜，就地取材，自己盖房。去年和今年在完成营建任务中，每平方米造价由规定的四十元左右降为二十五元左右。某炮团盖房子，只请了几名技工，自己搞砖、瓦、灰、沙、石，自己动手修建，节约经费十九万多元。某部发扬了“延安作风”，自己动手盖土窑洞式的库房，每平方米造价只用了七、八元。
    在军办工业方面，他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的“五·七”指示，发扬自力更生、奋发图强、勤俭办事、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，高速度、高质量地兴建了一些中小工业，有造纸、化肥、水泥、食盐、矿砂、炸药、木材加工以及副食品加工等。不仅生产了部队自需和与国家等价交换的产品，支援了国家建设，还使广大指战员和职工、家属轮流到工厂里劳动，受到了锻炼。某师只用一百零五天，就建成了一座日产五至七吨印毛主席著作的凸版纸的造纸厂，节约投资二十余万元。某部队在五个月内自己建成一座年产碳酸氢铵一万二千吨的化肥厂，降低造价百分之十九。
    在施工方面，工程部队坚持用毛泽东思想统帅施工，发动和依靠群众，大破陈规旧习，大搞技术革新，工程任务年年超额完成，材料消耗逐年减少，造价逐年降低。
    整个部队还广泛深入地开展了群众性的自修自制、收旧用旧和技术革新活动，今年以来，已为国家节约经费二百多万元。有些部门的施工部队的广大指战员，自觉地修补旧鞋，节约了大批鞋子。多数连队能自修自制一般工具器材，今年仅自修自制零件一项，就已节约十五万多元。某工程部队还自制了爬坡器八十台，大大减轻了劳动强度，节省了劳力。
    节约闹革命，是毛主席革命路线的重要组成部分，是忠于毛主席的实际行动
    北京部队开展群众性的节约运动的经验是：
    一、各级党委都把学习、宣传、贯彻毛主席要节约闹革命的伟大指示，作为贯彻毛主席革命路线的重要组成部分。他们认真组织全体人员学习毛主席最新指示，结合开展革命大批判，忆苦思甜，开办学习班，开讲用会、现场会，举办展览，以及抓典型、树样板等形式，反复宣传，经常教育，使广大指战员大大提高了对要节约闹革命重要意义的认识。战士们说：
  “节约不仅是省几个钱的问题，而是关系到部队举什么旗，站什么队，是否认真执行伟大领袖毛主席的指示，跟谁走的大问题。”部队的认识提高了，厉行节约的自觉性就强了，节约闹革命的动人事迹就大量涌现出来。
    二、广大指战员把勤俭节约，提高到无限忠于毛主席无限忠于人民的高度来认识，把节省一分钱、一度电、一粒米、一块煤，作为执行伟大领袖毛主席伟大指示的实际行动，作为全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众的具体表现。某团八连在天津执勤，从就近工厂废弃的煤渣堆里，筛拣了煤核三万多斤，用来烧水做饭，半年来没有烧过国家一块好煤。战士们说：“拣回一块煤核，就是拣回一分‘公’字，就是对伟大领袖毛主席献出一分忠心。”
    三、坚持用毛泽东思想教育部队，坚决发动和依靠群众，大大调动了群众的积极性和创造性。这一条抓得好，许多问题都能圆满解决。有的部队吃水困难，就自己挖井。有的住房困难，就自己盖。施工部队遇到困难不叫苦，不伸手，不坐等，工具坏了自己修，没有设备自己造，自觉地处处精打细算，勤俭办事。后勤部门的同志深有体会地说：“过去，业务部门单枪匹马，冷冷清清，困难成堆；现在，发动群众，群策群力，热气腾腾，问题都好解决。”
