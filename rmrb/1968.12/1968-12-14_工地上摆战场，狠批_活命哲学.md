The construction site becomes a battlefield, and the roar of machines and the sound of cannons fill the air. In a tunnel at the foot of a mountain in a certain place, the thunderous sound of slogans echoes: "Firmly support the correct decisions of the Twelfth Plenum!" "Expelling the traitor Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever is excellent!" "Thoroughly settle accounts with the traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi's heinous counter-revolutionary crimes!" This is the Ninth Company denouncing the traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi at the construction site.

Political instructor Zhang Guangbin fired the first shot. He said, "Liu Shaoqi, at the critical moment of the revolution, in order to save his own life, betrayed the Party and the revolution, repeatedly surrendered and confessed, and is a thorough traitor. He not only betrayed and surrendered himself to save his life but also spread the 'traitor's philosophy' and 'survival philosophy' everywhere to corrupt people's souls. He truly deserves to die ten thousand times! We are revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. We will never fall for the traitor Liu Shaoqi's tricks."

As soon as the political instructor finished speaking, Deputy Squad Leader Luo Dingkun stood up in a burst of anger and opened fire on the traitor Liu Shaoqi. He said, "The traitor Liu Shaoqi, in order to achieve his evil plot to usurp the Party and the government, relentlessly spread the idea that it is 'not worth it' to struggle and sacrifice for the Party and the people, saying that one should 'cherish oneself' and 'protect one's life and health.' He attempted to make us lose our revolutionary heroism of daring to struggle and daring to win, becoming deserters on the battlefield and cowards in the face of difficulties. Liu Shaoqi's heart is more vicious than a wolf. We are revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. For the revolution, we are willing to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, and we are ready to be crushed to pieces. Looking back at the time when our company was building roads on the windy and snowy plateau of Tibet, the road had to pass through the middle of a strange mountain. We had to climb up and place explosives on top. The local Tibetans said, 'To climb such a mountain, one needs the claws of a leopard and the agility of a monkey.' But revolutionaries have a red sun in their hearts, and no difficulty can stop them. Soldier Wu Kangzhan volunteered, using his hands to grip the rock crevices and his feet to step on the protruding rocks, climbing step by step. When he reached a height of five meters, he was exhausted. If he had the slightest fear, he would have fallen off the mountain. But at that moment, he thought, this is not about climbing a mountain, but about ascending the peak of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Climbing up is a criticism of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for being cowardly and traitorous at the critical moment of the revolution. Thus, he mustered his courage and climbed up, placing the explosives and clearing the way for the road construction. We revolutionaries, with the revolutionary spirit and heroism of 'for the sake of sacrifice, we have great aspirations, and we dare to change the heavens and the earth,' have cut through the cliffs and made the high mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way. Let me tell you, Liu Shaoqi, you coward, you want to poison us revolutionaries with your 'survival philosophy,' but you will never succeed!"

New soldier Shàn Qíqín, filled with hatred for Liu Shaoqi, shouted the slogans "Down with Liu Shaoqi! Bury the 'survival philosophy'!" and spoke, "'Survival philosophy' is a poison. When I first joined the army, seeing the jagged and ferocious rocks in the caves, my heart was always racing, fearing that the rocks would fall and hit my head. With the help of my comrades, I studied Chairman Mao's brilliant 'Three Constantly Read Articles' and realized that 'dying for the people is a worthy death.' Without the bloodshed and sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs of the past, there would be no new China today. Without countless selfless and fearless revolutionary soldiers, there would be no power we have today. We revolutionaries must, as Chairman Mao taught, 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people."

Revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought are hard-boned fighters who defy the heavens and the earth and conquer enemies. They value the revolutionary cause above everything else, care more about others than themselves, fear no sacrifice, fight bravely, and dedicate themselves to the public. The Ninth Company has had many moving examples in the past. Once, a major cave-in occurred inside the cave, and the comrades loading stones inside were trapped by the falling boulders. Their lives and machinery were seriously threatened. The comrades of the first platoon outside, responsible for transporting stones, made an ironclad vow: no matter how big the cave-in, we must clear it, and no matter how the mountain collapses and the earth cracks, we must rescue our comrades. They rushed into the danger zone, fearing neither falling rocks nor the darkness inside the cave, and bravely rescued their comrades. Soldier Zhang Youcheng saw the falling debris and immediately used his body to protect the driver, Ji Yongcheng, quickly moving the stone-loading machine out of the cave.

Deputy Political Instructor Ma Yaoxian guided the comrades to use these heart-pounding scenes and moving stories as heavy artillery to bombard Liu Shaoqi. The comrades' indignation towards the traitor Liu Shaoqi grew with each criticism, and they continuously shouted, "Down with Liu Shaoqi! Bury the 'survival philosophy'! Thoroughly settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the revolution!" The slogans echoed through the tunnel and shook the mountains.

As soon as the on-site criticism meeting ended, the comrades, filled with the joy of victory and revolutionary enthusiasm, returned to the intense battle with their hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Everyone is determined to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to fight and dare to win, overcome all difficulties, and strive for new victories. The sound of machines roaring and air guns bellowing can be heard inside the cave. The Ninth Company's soldiers and officers are advancing towards victory along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

    工地上摆战场，狠批“活命哲学”
    机器轰隆，炮声震天。在某地山脚下的一个隧道里，传出一阵阵震耳雷鸣的口号声：“坚决拥护十二中全会的英明决定！”“把大叛徒刘少奇永远开除出党好得很！”“彻底清算大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的反革命滔天罪行！”这是九连在施工现场声讨大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇。
    指导员常广斌开了第一炮。他说：“刘少奇在革命的关键时刻，为了换取自己的一条狗命，就出卖党，出卖革命，多次叛变自首，是一个地地道道的大叛徒。他不仅自己叛变自首，保住狗命，还到处散布腐蚀人们灵魂的‘叛徒哲学’、‘活命哲学’，真是罪该万死！我们是无限忠于毛主席的革命战士，绝对不上大叛徒刘少奇的当。”
    指导员的话音刚落，副排长罗定坤满腔怒火，霍地站了起来，向大叛徒刘少奇开了炮。他说：“大叛徒刘少奇为了达到他篡党、篡政的罪恶阴谋，拚命地散布为党为人民英勇奋斗而牺牲是‘最不值得的’，说什么应该‘钟爱自己’，‘保护自己的生命与健康’，妄图使我们丧失敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命英雄主义，成为战场上的逃兵和困难面前的软骨头。刘少奇的黑心真是比豺狼还狠。我们是无限忠于毛主席的革命战士，为了革命，我们就是要刀山敢上，火海敢闯，粉身碎骨也在所不惜。回顾连队在西藏风雪高原筑路时，公路要从一座怪山的半山腰通过，必须登上去，把炸药放在上面。藏民说：‘要登这样的山，要有金钱豹的爪子，猴子那样灵活的身子才行。’但是，革命战士心中有颗红太阳，千难万险无阻挡。战士吴抗战自告奋勇，手扒着岩石缝，脚蹬鼓出来的岩石，一步一步登上去。登上五米高时，他精疲力尽，只要稍有害怕的心理，就有掉下山的危险。但他这时想到，这不是登山，而是在攀登忠于毛主席的高峰，登上去就是对刘少奇及其同伙在革命关键时刻贪生怕死、投敌叛党的批判。于是，他鼓足勇气登了上去，放上了炸药，为修路打开了道路。我们革命战士就是凭着‘为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天’的革命精神和英雄气概，劈开了悬崖绝壁，使高山低了头，河水让开了路。告诉你！刘少奇，你这个怕死鬼，想用‘活命哲学’来毒害我们革命战士，永远办不到！”
    新战士单其勤满怀对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，高呼着“打倒刘少奇！埋葬‘活命哲学’！”的口号发了言：“‘活命哲学’，就是害人的毒药。我刚入伍时，看到峒子里呲牙咧嘴、张牙舞爪的怪石，心里总是七上八下的，担心石头掉下来砸破了脑袋。在同志们的帮助下，我学习了毛主席光辉的‘老三篇’，认识到，‘为人民而死，就是死得其所。’没有过去革命先烈的流血牺牲，就没有今天的新中国，没有千百万无私无畏的革命战士，就没有我们今天的政权。我们革命战士就是要象毛主席教导的那样‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务。”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，是战天斗地、克敌制胜的硬骨头。他们把革命事业看得高于一切，关心他人比关心自己为重，不怕牺牲，英勇战斗，一心为公献忠心。九连在过去施工中，曾经出现过不少这类动人的事例。有一次，峒内发生了大塌方，在峒内装石渣的同志，被塌下来的巨石封在里面。他们的生命和机器受到严重的威胁。在峒外担任运石渣的一排同志，发出了钢铁般的誓言：塌方再大也要除，山崩地裂也要抢救战友。他们冲进了险区，不怕乱石砸，不怕峒内黑，奋不顾身地抢救战友。战士张有程，眼看着碎石倾泻下来，他立即用身体掩护司机季永成，迅速地使他把装渣机开出峒外。
    副指导员马耀先引导同志们用这样一个个惊心动魄的场面，一个个感人的事迹，当作一发发重型炮弹向刘少奇劈头盖脑地打去。同志们对大叛徒刘少奇的义愤越批越大，不断高呼：“打倒刘少奇！埋葬活命哲学！”“彻底清算刘少奇叛变革命的滔天罪行！”口号声激荡着坑道，震撼了群山。
    现场批判会一结束，同志们带着胜利的喜悦和革命的豪情壮志，怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，又投入了紧张的战斗。大家决心发扬敢打敢拚的革命精神，排除一切困难，争取新的胜利。只听得峒内机器轰隆，风枪怒吼，九连指战员们正沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。
