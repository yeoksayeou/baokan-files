Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist forces, the revolutionary workers of Benxi Steel Company have seized the revolution and promoted production. By December 27, they had fully completed this year's production tasks.

Since this year, the total production value of Benxi Steel Company has been on a steady rise. Steel products and ingots have completed the annual national plan 54 days and 20 days ahead of schedule, respectively. Pig iron, metallurgical coke, iron ore mining and stripping, refractory bricks, artificial rich ore, limestone, sulfuric acid, and 19 other products have all exceeded the annual national plan. The quantity and quality of various products have all seen significant improvements, with some products even surpassing historical highs. The company has successfully developed new products with international advanced levels, equaling the total of the previous three years. The Second Coke Plant has produced 11 products, all of which have broken historical records. In the first eleven months of this year, the company has implemented over 600 major technological innovation projects.

During the struggle, criticism, and reform campaign, the revolutionary workers of Benxi Steel Company, using revolutionary criticism as their driving force, launched a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents within the company. Steel workers have reformed over 100 unreasonable regulations, reducing the time to smelt each furnace of steel by a quarter, continuously increasing steel production. In November, the monthly steel production exceeded the historical high. The mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement has powerfully promoted the leapfrog development of production.

The revolutionary workers of Benxi Steel Company are determined to advance further. While deeply studying the history of the two-line struggle within the party, they will seriously summarize the experiences of seizing the revolution and promoting production over the past year to prepare for the production leap in the coming year.

    广大革命职工充分发挥革命干劲
    本钢提前完成全年生产计划
    据新华社沈阳二十八日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在解放军支左部队的帮助下，本溪钢铁公司广大革命职工，抓革命、促生产，于十二月二十七日，全面完成了今年的生产任务。
    今年以来，本溪钢铁公司的生产总值直线上升，钢材、钢锭分别提前五十四天和二十天完成了全年的国家计划，生铁、冶金焦炭、铁矿石采剥总量、耐火砖、人造富矿、石灰石、硫酸等十九种产品，已经全面超额完成了全年的国家计划。各种产品的产量和质量，都有大幅度的提高，其中，有的产品已超过历史的最高水平。全公司试制成功的具有国际先进水平的新产品，等于前三年的总和。第二焦化厂生产的十一种产品，全部刷新了历史的最高纪录。今年头十一个月，全公司实现了重大技术革新项目共六百多项。
    本溪钢铁公司广大革命职工，在斗、批、改高潮中，以革命大批判为动力，对准叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在本单位的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线展开了猛烈的冲击。炼钢工人先后改革了一百多项不合理的规章制度，把每炼一炉钢的时间缩短了四分之一，使钢的产量不断上升，十一月份钢月产量超过了历史的最高水平。群众性的技术革新、技术革命运动，有力地推动了生产的飞跃发展。
    本溪钢铁公司广大革命职工，决心乘胜前进，在深入学习党内两条路线斗争史的同时，认真总结一年来抓革命，促生产的经验，为明年生产跃进作准备。
