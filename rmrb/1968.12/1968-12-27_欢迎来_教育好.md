Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xinzhou County, filled with deep proletarian feelings, have shown meticulous care for the sent-down youth in every aspect of their political thought and production life. They have pledged to:

Welcome them and educate them well.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 26th - Chairman Mao has recently instructed us again: "It is necessary for intellectual youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade cadres and other people in the cities to send their children, who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, or college, to the countryside, and mobilize them. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, have already mobilized completely to welcome the intellectual youth to the countryside, regarding it as a most glorious task entrusted to them by the great leader Chairman Mao. With the greatest enthusiasm, the fastest actions, and the most meticulous arrangements, they have welcomed and received the sent-down youth, showing meticulous care in every aspect of their political thought and production life. This has demonstrated the poor and lower-middle peasants' loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and expressed their ardent expectations for the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Xinzhou County has already seen a large number of intellectual youth settle down in the countryside. Additionally, it has received over 300 junior high school graduates from Wuhan who have gone to the countryside to settle down. The sent-down youth who came here were deeply moved, saying: "When we entered the production team's house, it felt as if we were children who had been away for a long time, just returning to our parents."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." In the work of receiving the youth going to the countryside and up the mountains, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xinzhou County have always placed the large-scale propaganda and mobilization, and arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, at the forefront. Since September this year, they have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, put up big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and big criticism columns, used broadcasts, lantern slides, films, and held cultural performances, and carried out large-scale propaganda activities. Throughout the county, a great movement has been launched to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on intellectual youth going to the countryside and up the mountains to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, such as "study to become an official," "suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage," "go to the countryside to gain experience," and "public-private fusion." Through the great ideological mobilization, Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions and the great significance of the intellectual youth going to the countryside and up the mountains have been deeply ingrained in people's hearts and known to every household. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants all regard warmly welcoming the intellectual youth to settle down and patiently and meticulously re-educating the intellectual youth as the most glorious task entrusted to them by the great leader Chairman Mao. They excitedly say: The intellectual youth going to the countryside and up the mountains and combining with the workers and peasants is the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao, the fundamental way to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and a long-term and thousand-year plan to prevent and combat revisionism. Chairman Mao has entrusted us with such a glorious task, which is the greatest trust and greatest encouragement to us poor and lower-middle peasants. They say: "We must welcome them, keep them, and cultivate them well."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xinzhou County have made thorough and meticulous preparations for the intellectual youth going to the countryside in terms of political thought and production life. The poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most. The first thing they prepared for the sent-down youth was to set up an environment of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, so that the youth can always be loyal to Chairman Mao. The first gift the poor and lower-middle peasants prepared for the sent-down youth was the revolutionary treasure - "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

The first lesson the poor and lower-middle peasants prepared for the intellectual youth was a class education lesson. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, after the youth arrive, we will tell them about family history, village history, and commune history, so they understand what oppression is, what exploitation is, what class and class struggle are, and educate them to resolutely criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the sixth production brigade of Hongqi Commune's first brigade specially drew a set of village history picture cards and hung them in their rooms, so that they would never forget the bitterness of their class, remember the blood debt of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and always follow Chairman Mao to revolution.

While the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are enthusiastically concerned about the intellectual youth going to the countryside in terms of politics, they have also made necessary preparations for them in terms of production and life. For example, production tools, housing, rations, vegetables, firewood, and other daily necessities have all been prepared before the intellectual youth arrive. Moreover, they have considered it very carefully, always thinking about what is beneficial to the re-education of the intellectual youth going to the countryside.

Under the warm welcome and enthusiastic reception of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the sent-down youth have received profound education and have expressed their determination to always be loyal to Chairman Mao, to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside, and to revolutionize for life.

    遵照毛主席的教导，新洲县贫下中农满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，从政治思想到生产生活给插队落户的知识青年以无微不至的关怀，他们表示一定要做到：
    欢迎来  教育好
    据新华社武汉二十六日电　毛主席最近又一次教导我们：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”湖北省新洲县广大贫下中农，已经全面动员起来，把欢迎知识青年到农村来，当作伟大领袖毛主席交给的一项最光荣的任务。他们以最大的热情，最快的行动，最细致的安排，欢迎和接待下乡落户的知识青年，从政治思想到生产生活真正做到了无微不至的关怀，体现了贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，表达了贫下中农对无产阶级革命事业接班人的殷切期望。
    新洲县已有大批知识青年到农村安家落户。另外还接待了武汉市下乡插队落户的三百多名中学毕业生。下乡知识青年来到这里深受感动地说：“我们到生产队一进屋门，就好象是出远门的孩子刚回到自己父母身边一样。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”新洲县广大贫下中农，在接待知识青年下乡上山的工作中，一直把大张旗鼓的宣传动员，用毛泽东思想武装广大群众放在首位。从今年九月开始，他们就采取举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织毛泽东思想宣传队，出大字报、黑板报、大批判专栏，运用广播、幻灯、电影，举行文艺演出等各种形式，开展了声势浩大的宣传活动。在全县范围内迅速掀起了一个学习毛主席关于知识青年下乡上山接受工农兵再教育的一系列光辉指示，批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇散布的“读书做官”、“吃小亏占大便宜”、“下乡镀金”、“公私溶化”等反革命修正主义谬论的伟大群众运动。通过思想上的大发动，使毛主席的光辉指示和知识青年下乡上山的伟大意义深入人心，家喻户晓。广大贫下中农都把热烈欢迎知识青年插队落户，耐心细致地对知识青年进行再教育，看成是伟大领袖毛主席交给自己最光荣的任务。他们激动地说：知识青年下乡上山，与工农群众相结合，这是毛主席指引的光明大道，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本途径，是防修反修的百年大计，千年大计。毛主席把这样光荣的任务交给我们，是对我们贫下中农的最大信任、最大鞭策。他们说：“对下乡知识青年，我们一定做到欢迎来，留得住，培养好。”
    新洲县广大贫下中农从政治思想、生产生活上都为下乡知识青年作了充分细致的准备。贫下中农最热爱毛主席，他们为下乡落户的知识青年准备好的第一件事，是把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”环境布置好，好让知识青年永远忠于毛主席。贫下中农为下乡知识青年准备的第一件礼物，是革命宝书——《毛泽东选集》。
    贫下中农为知识青年准备的第一堂课，是阶级教育课。贫下中农说，青年们来了后，我们要向他们讲家史、讲村史、讲公社史，让他们懂得什么是压迫，什么是剥削，什么是阶级和阶级斗争，教育他们狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。红旗公社第一大队第六生产队贫下中农为了给下乡知识青年上好阶级教育课，特地画了一套村史图片，挂在他们的屋子里，让他们不忘阶级苦，牢记贫下中农的血泪仇，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
    广大贫下中农在从政治上热情关心下乡知识青年的同时，也从生产生活上为他们作好了必要的准备。比如，生产工具、住房、口粮、蔬菜、烧柴和其他生活用品，都在下乡知识青年到队之前就准备好了。而且考虑得十分周到，处处从有利于对下乡知识青年进行再教育着想。
    下乡落户的知识青年在广大贫下中农的热情欢迎和殷切接待下，受到深刻的教育，纷纷表示要永远忠于毛主席，在农村接受贫下中农的再教育，干一辈子革命。
