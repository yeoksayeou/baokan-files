Italian workers and students unyieldingly continue their struggle.

	According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 11th, the struggle of Italian workers against the ruthless exploitation by the monopoly bourgeoisie and the struggle of students against the decaying capitalist educational system and the authorities' suppression of the student movement are continuing to surge forward, increasingly powerfully shaking the reactionary rule of the Italian monopoly capitalist clique.

	Workers in southern Italy's Sicily and Sardinia in the Mediterranean Sea held general strikes on the 9th, 10th, and 11th, demanding wage increases and full employment. At the same time, 30,000 agricultural workers in Sicily began a strike on the 9th, demanding higher wages. It is reported that workers in Apulia, Emilia, Abruzzo, Tuscany, and other regions will also hold general strikes in the coming days to protest the employers' refusal to meet the workers' legitimate demands for wage increases. The total number of workers participating in these general strikes in these regions will reach several million. In addition, public transportation workers in the capital, Rome, are also preparing to go on strike.

	The just struggle of the workers has gained the widespread support of progressive students. In many places, there is a strong atmosphere of unity and struggle between workers and students. On the 10th, in Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia, striking workers at a rally expressed their warm thanks to progressive students for their support. In the two cities of Iglesias and Carbonia in the southwestern part of the island, local progressive students participated in the workers' demonstration marches. In Nuoro, workers and students marched side by side, singing the majestic "Internationale."

	Meanwhile, students in many cities in Italy continue to take revolutionary actions such as demonstrations, marches, and occupying schools, expressing their opposition to the decaying educational system and strongly protesting the authorities' suppression of the student movement. On the 10th, more than a thousand students in Genoa demonstrated in the city center to protest police brutality. They clashed with the police during the confrontation, engaging in fierce struggles.

    工人的正义斗争获得了进步学生的广泛支持，在许多地方，工人、学生之间洋溢着一片团结战斗的气氛。十日，在撒丁岛首府卡利亚里，罢工工人在集会上对进步学生的支持表示热烈感谢，在这个岛西南部的伊格莱齐亚斯和卡波尼亚两市，当地的进步学生都参加了罢工工人的示威游行，在努奥罗市，工人、学生一起高唱着雄壮的《国际歌》并肩游行。
    与此同时，意大利许多城市的大、中学生继续采取游行示威和占领学校等革命行动，表示反对腐朽的教育制度并强烈抗议当局镇压学生运动。热那亚市一千多名学生十日在市中心示威抗议警察暴行，他们在冲击当地警察局时，同进行镇压的警察展开了激烈的搏斗。
