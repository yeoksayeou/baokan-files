The propaganda teams of workers and the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with the Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin Textile Mill, have vigorously promoted the education of the revolutionary masses on the struggle between the two lines, effectively advancing the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: The worker and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have played a leading role for the working class, working together with various levels of revolutionary committees to use class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the guiding principle. They have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes within the academy, enhancing the revolutionary masses' awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and igniting a mass movement to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings that the working class must lead everything, after the worker and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered the Chinese Academy of Sciences, they first used class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the guiding principle to organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They educated the broad revolutionary masses on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, enabling the revolutionary masses to firmly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and consciously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the study classes, many veteran workers from the propaganda teams recalled the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, especially the more than two years of battle during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They shared their personal experiences of how, at every critical moment of the Cultural Revolution, they seriously studied and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly grasped Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and continuously achieved victories. They used these experiences to inspire the revolutionary masses' awareness of the struggle between the two lines and enhance their consciousness of seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Through the study, the broad revolutionary masses deepened their profound proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said, the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines within the party tells us that as long as we seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolution will be invincible. The broad revolutionary masses voluntarily checked on the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and quickly resolved long-standing "difficult problems."

Before the worker and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered the Mathematical Research Institute and the Science Press, these units were considered "difficult to manage." Now, the masses in these units have been fully mobilized. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a high tide of criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "Black Six Articles" and the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory." The revolutionary masses set up many revolutionary criticism columns, created new forms of revolutionary criticism such as on-site criticism meetings, broadcast criticism meetings, and small-scale struggle sessions, and fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in these units. The revolutionary criticism was carried out vividly and effectively. The work of cleaning up class ranks is also being deepened. The revolutionary masses in the Mathematical Research Institute and the Physics Research Institute, building on the achievements of the previous phase of cleaning up class ranks, further used the perspective of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to deeply expose and uproot long-hidden class enemies. The revolutionary masses said, by enhancing the awareness of the struggle between the two lines and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we can achieve victory in all battles.

Through study, the members of various levels of revolutionary committees and leading groups deeply understood that the fundamental difference between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi lies in their attitudes towards the masses. Therefore, they went to the masses, struggled against selfishness and criticized revisionism together with the masses, listened to the masses' opinions, accepted the masses' supervision, and promoted the revolutionization of thought.

After Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee was reissued, the worker and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed at the Chinese Academy of Sciences immediately organized study classes in the original headquarters of the academy and the Chemical and Metallurgical Research Institute. The main content of these classes was to study and grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and deeply criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They decided to work together with the broad revolutionary masses of the academy to further seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, continuously enhance their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 1st: The Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin Textile Mill pays attention to regularly educating the broad revolutionary workers on the struggle between the two lines, insisting on implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the sharp and complex class struggle, they continuously enhance the revolutionary workers' awareness of the struggle between the two lines, which plays a crucial role in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and promoting the implementation of the struggle, criticism, and transformation and various tasks.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be frequently discussed and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." During the study of Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the members of the Tianjin Textile Mill Revolutionary Committee, combined with the actual situation of their factory, summarized five effective methods for educating the masses on the struggle between the two lines:

First, Chairman Mao's latest instructions and all orders from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin must be directly conveyed to the broad revolutionary masses, word for word. This allows the broad revolutionary workers to know Chairman Mao's teachings on various issues in the struggle and directly grasp Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Second, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is necessary to combine the struggle of each phase with the actual situation and regularly carry out activities to recall the suffering under Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line and compare the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This kind of recall and comparison activity, combined with the actual struggle between the two lines, has a direct impact on the masses, is deeply felt, and has good results. The masses reflected, "The more we recall, the more we hate Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and the more we compare, the more we cherish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Third, through grasping new issues, new trends, and new signs in the struggle between the two lines, conduct living education on the struggle between the two lines for the masses. For example, during the cleanup of class ranks, a small handful of deeply hidden class enemies in this factory fiercely counterattacked, plotting to overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee and attempting to restore capitalism. With the help of the stationed troops, the factory revolutionary committee led the broad revolutionary masses to expose the tricks of the class enemies and used this living example to conduct a profound education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines for the masses.

Fourth, persist in deeply and continuously carrying out revolutionary criticism. In the process of revolutionary criticism, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings, continuously deepen the understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This factory's revolutionary committee, by insisting on carrying out revolutionary criticism, has enabled the broad revolutionary workers to receive systematic and comprehensive education on the struggle between the two lines.

Fifth, the members of the revolutionary committee use their personal experiences in the struggle between the two lines to frequently educate the masses on the struggle between the two lines in the factory-wide study and application of Mao Zedong Thought meetings and in the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism study classes held with the masses.

Because this factory's revolutionary committee regularly pays attention to educating the broad revolutionary masses on the struggle between the two lines, good results have been achieved. The broad masses summarized that there are four major advantages: Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin can be smoothly implemented; the revolutionary workers' awareness of the struggle between the two lines and their consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line have been enhanced; historical lessons have been drawn from the struggle between the two lines, increasing the ability to recognize bourgeois sugar-coated bullets; the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary committee members and the broad masses has been accelerated; the broad revolutionary masses have the concept of the struggle between the two lines in their minds, resisting anything that does not conform to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, preventing restoration, and not taking the backward road. They will forever advance towards the revolutionary direction indicated by Chairman Mao, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

During the serious study of Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combined with the actual situation of the factory, the factory revolutionary committee further launched a mass movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines throughout the factory. This better implemented the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and greatly promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire factory. Building on the achievements of various tasks such as large-scale criticism, cleanup of class ranks, rectification of the party, streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, and transferring office personnel in the previous phase, the factory revolutionary committee mobilized the masses to find gaps in each item and formulated measures to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They also, based on the completion of this year's national production plan 55 days ahead of schedule, mobilized the masses to discuss next year's production plan. The workers said, we will use the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm and the best results to welcome the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party and the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

    大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班
    提高广大革命群众的路线斗争觉悟
    驻中国科学院工人解放军宣传队和天津市麻纺织厂革委会狠抓对革命群众的两条路线斗争教育，有力地促进了斗批改
    新华社一日讯　进驻中国科学院的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，发挥工人阶级的领导作用，和各级革委会一起，以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为纲，在科学院大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，提高广大革命群众的两条路线斗争觉悟，掀起全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改的群众运动热潮。
    遵照毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大教导，工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队进驻中国科学院以后，为了带领革命群众完成毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，首先以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为纲，办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，对广大革命群众进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，使革命群众能够牢牢地掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，自觉地贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在学习班上，宣传队的很多老工人回顾了党内两条路线斗争的历史，特别是无产阶级文化大革命两年多来的战斗历程，以自己的亲身经历，讲述在文化大革命的每一个关键时刻，认真学习、坚决落实毛主席最新指示，牢牢掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断取得胜利的深刻体会，以此来启发广大革命群众的路线斗争觉悟，提高广大革命群众认真学习、坚决落实毛主席最新指示的自觉性。通过学习，广大革命群众加深了对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情。他们说，党内两条路线斗争的历史经验告诉我们，只要认真学习和坚决落实毛主席的指示，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，革命就无往而不胜。广大革命群众纷纷自觉地检查落实毛主席最新指示的情况，进一步学习和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使长期没有解决的“老大难”问题迅速解决了。
    数学研究所、科学出版社等几个单位，在工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队进驻以前是“老大难”单位。现在，这些单位的群众充分发动起来了。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，掀起了批判刘少奇的黑“六论”和反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”的高潮。革命群众办起了很多革命大批判专栏，创造了现场批判会、广播批判会、小型批斗等革命大批判的新形式，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在本单位代理人的反革命罪行，革命大批判搞得有声有色。清理阶级队伍的工作也正在深入发展。数学研究所、物理研究所等单位的革命群众，在前一阶段清理阶级队伍取得成绩的基础上，进一步用阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的观点，深揭、深挖，揪出了长期隐藏的阶级敌人。革命群众说，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，落实了毛主席一系列最新指示，我们就攻无不克，战无不胜。
    各级革命委员会和领导小组成员通过学习，深刻地认识到，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线的一个根本区别，就是对待群众的态度问题。因此，他们纷纷到群众中去，和群众在一起斗私批修，听取群众意见，接受群众监督，促进了思想革命化。
    毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告重新发表后，驻中国科学院工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队立即在原院部机关、化学冶金研究所等单位办起了以学习和掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，深入批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线为主要内容的学习班，决心和科学院的广大革命群众在一起，进一步认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在斗争中不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    新华社天津一日电　天津市麻纺织厂革命委员会注意经常对广大革命职工进行两条路线斗争的教育，坚持贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中不断提高广大革命职工的两条路线斗争觉悟，对于落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，推动斗、批、改和各项任务的贯彻落实，起了极重要的作用。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”天津市麻纺织厂革委会成员在学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席最新指示的时候，结合本厂实际，总结了对群众进行两条路线斗争教育的五项有效办法：
    第一，毛主席的最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切号令，要原原本本地直接传达给广大革命群众，让广大革命职工在斗争中都能知道毛主席在各个问题上的教导，直接掌握毛主席的革命路线。
    第二，在无产阶级文化大革命的进程中，要结合各个阶段的斗争实际，经常开展忆遭受刘少奇资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜的活动，对群众进行两条路线斗争的教育。这种结合两条路线斗争实际进行的忆比活动，群众有直接感受，体会深刻，效果很好。群众反映说：“越忆对刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线越恨，越比对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越亲。”
    第三，通过抓住两条路线斗争中的新问题、新动向、新苗头，对群众进行活的两条路线斗争教育。譬如，在清理阶级队伍的时候，这个厂一小撮隐蔽得极深的阶级敌人猖狂反扑，阴谋策划搞垮新生的革委会，妄图实行资本主义复辟。厂革委会在驻军的帮助下，带领广大革命群众揭发了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，并且抓住这个活生生的事例，对群众进行了一次深刻的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育。
    第四，坚持深入持久地开展革命大批判，在大批判的过程中，活学活用毛主席的光辉教导，不断加深对毛主席革命路线的理解，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。这个厂的革委会由于坚持开展革命的大批判，使广大革命职工受到了系统的、全面的两条路线斗争的教育。
    第五，革委会成员用自己在两条路线斗争中的亲身感受，在全厂职工活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会上，在同群众一起举办的斗私批修学习班上，现身说法，经常对群众进行两条路线斗争的教育。
    由于这个厂的革委会经常注意对广大革命群众进行两条路线斗争的教育，收到了很好的效果。广大群众总结说，他们这样做有四大好处：毛主席的最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，能够畅通无阻地贯彻落实；提高了广大革命职工两条路线斗争的觉悟，提高了执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性和批判刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的自觉性；从两条路线斗争中吸取历史教训，增强了识别资产阶级糖衣炮弹的能力。加速了革委会成员和广大职工的思想革命化；广大革命群众头脑里有了两条路线斗争的观念，对不符合毛主席革命路线的事情就抵制，可以防止复旧，不走回头路，永远朝着毛主席指引的革命航向前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    这个厂的革委会在认真学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席的最新指示的时候，结合本厂的实际情况，在全厂进一步展开了一个群众性的学习两条路线斗争史的运动，更好地落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，大大推动了全厂的斗、批、改。厂革委会在前一阶段开展大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党、精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员等各项工作中取得成绩的基础上，放手发动群众逐条地找了差距，订出了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的措施。他们还在提前五十五天超额完成今年全年国家生产计划的基础上，发动群众讨论了明年的生产计划。工人们说，我们要用最大的革命干劲和最好的成绩，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开和中华人民共和国成立二十周年的大庆！
