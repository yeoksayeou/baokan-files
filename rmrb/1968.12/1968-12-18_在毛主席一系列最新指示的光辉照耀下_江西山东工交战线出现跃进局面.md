Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the industrial and transportation fronts in Jiangxi and Shandong have achieved great leaps forward.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 16: The revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Jiangxi Province, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and his latest instructions, and inspired by the great encouragement of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué, have been vigorously carrying out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have fully exerted the leadership of the working class, deepening the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement, and achieving new leaps in production.

Currently, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts is surging forward on the industrial and transportation fronts across the province. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, and their spiritual faces have undergone profound changes. Chairman Mao's thoughts, when widely combined with the masses, have produced immense material forces. The industrial production level in the province has been rising month by month and season by season. Industries such as coal, textiles, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, light industry, and machinery have all seen significant increases in production. More than twenty major products, including raw coal, cotton cloth, dyed cloth, sackcloth, cigarettes, caustic soda, carbide, universal milling machines, etc., have reached or exceeded their historical highs. Since mid-October, more than forty factories and mines across the province have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule.

Seriously studying the history of the struggle between the two lines and fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line have greatly enhanced the awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the fundamental reason for the series of brilliant victories achieved on the industrial and transportation fronts in Jiangxi. The workers of the Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory, through revolutionary criticism and learning from the People's Liberation Army, have raised their political awareness. Workers have improved their operating methods, continuously increasing work efficiency, and have created the highest records for cotton yarn since the factory's establishment. The dyed cloth has far exceeded the historical high. After the political construction of the Nanchang Rubber Factory, the average daily production of rubber shoes and tires has increased by about onefold compared to the past.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call for the working class to lead everything, the struggle, criticism, and transformation on the industrial and transportation fronts in Jiangxi have reached a new high. Workers in various factories and mines directly participate in management, further taking control of the technical, financial, and labor management powers of the factories, thoroughly breaking away from Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line of managing enterprises, greatly liberating productive forces, and promoting production development. The workers of the Jiangxi Electric Machine Factory have successfully developed four new products in just three months.

A magnificent wave of technological innovation and technological revolution has emerged across the province's industrial and transportation enterprises. According to incomplete statistics, the province has implemented more than 4,300 innovation projects this year, with many reaching domestic and international advanced levels.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 16: Under the encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class in Shandong Province has high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, continuously raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and achieved an unprecedented good situation on the industrial and transportation fronts across the province. So far, the province's total industrial output has exceeded the historical high.

Over the past year, the characteristics of industrial production in Shandong Province have been: production levels increasing month by month and quarter by quarter. The total production value in the second quarter increased by 20.9% compared to the first quarter, the third quarter increased by 4.78% compared to the second quarter, and the fourth quarter increased by 9.4% compared to the third quarter. The industrial and transportation fronts across the province have achieved new leaps forward. Major industrial products such as raw coal, chemical fertilizers, machine tools, electric motors, power generation, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, cement, sewing machines, thermos bottles, matches, and soap have all seen significant increases. In terms of highway construction, by breaking foreign frameworks and mobilizing the masses, the asphalt pavement built this year is equivalent to the total asphalt pavement built since liberation. The volume of goods transported by rail in the second half of this year increased by 18% compared to the same period last year.

With the development of production, new products, new equipment, new processes, and new technologies have emerged in large numbers. According to incomplete statistics from the Qingdao and Changwei regions, this year, 394 new products, innovative processes, and new equipment have been successfully developed.

    在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下
    江西山东工交战线出现跃进局面
    据新华社南昌十六日电　江西省工业交通战线的广大革命职工，在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和一系列最新指示的指引下，在党的八届十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，斗、批、改运动深入发展，生产出现新的跃进。
    现在，全省工交战线广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断高涨，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。毛泽东思想广泛地同人民群众结合，就产生了巨大的物质力量。全省工业生产水平逐季逐月上升，煤炭、纺织、化工、有色金属、轻工、机械等行业的生产都有很大增长，原煤、棉布、印染布、麻袋、卷烟、烧碱、电石、万能铣床等二十多种主要产品的生产都达到或超过了历史上的最高水平。从十月中旬以来，全省已有四十多个厂矿企业提前完成全年的生产计划。
    认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，大大提高了执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，这是江西省工交战线夺得一个个辉煌胜利的根本原因。江西棉纺织印染厂广大职工通过革命大批判，和大学解放军，提高了政治觉悟，工人们改进了操作方法，工效不断提高，棉纱创造了建厂以来的最高纪录，印染布大大超过历史最高水平。南昌橡胶厂实行政治建厂后，胶鞋、轮胎平均日产量比过去增长一倍左右。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出工人阶级必须领导一切的号召后，江西省工交战线的斗、批、改出现了新高潮。各厂矿企业的工人直接参加管理，进一步把工厂的技术权、财权、劳动管理权牢牢地掌握在自己手里，进一步破除了刘少奇的修正主义办企业路线，大大解放了生产力，促进了生产的发展。江西电机厂工人在三个月内就试制成功了四种新产品。
    全省工交企业已经出现了波澜壮阔的技术革新、技术革命的高潮。据不完全统计，全省今年革新项目有四千三百多项，许多项目达到国内和国际先进水平。
    据新华社济南十六日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，山东省工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真学习党内两条路线斗争史，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，全省工业交通战线出现前所未有的大好形势。到目前为止，全省工业总产值已超过历史上的最高水平。
    一年来，山东省工业生产的特点是：生产水平一月高过一月，一季超过一季。二季度生产总值比一季度增长百分之二十点九，三季度比二季度增长百分之四点七八，四季度又比三季度增长百分之九点四。全省工业交通战线出现了新的跃进局面。主要工业产品如原煤、化肥、机床、电动机、发电量、棉纱、棉布、纸张、水泥、缝纫机、保温瓶、火柴、肥皂等，都有较大幅度的增长。公路建设方面，由于打破洋框框，广泛发动群众，今年修建的沥青路面，相当于解放以来修建的沥青路面的总和。铁路货运量，今年下半年比去年同期增长百分之十八。
    随着生产的发展，新产品、新设备、新工艺、新技术大量涌现。仅据青岛、昌潍两个地区的不完全统计，今年试制成功的新产品、革新的新工艺、新设备，就有三百九十四项。
