	The Belgian leftist publication "Light" recently published an article celebrating the issuance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Enlarged Twelfth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The article enthusiastically praises the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao.

	The article states: "Marxist-Leninists living and fighting in Belgium attach great importance to the issuance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Enlarged Twelfth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China."

	The article points out: In the Soviet Union, the revisionists were able to betray the October Revolution and socialism, which is a problem that we must constantly study. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has given an appropriate answer to this problem. The article praises this revolution for achieving astonishing victories, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and smashing the conspiracies of the bourgeoisie and their spokesmen. Now, except for Taiwan, which is still occupied by U.S. imperialists, revolutionary committees have been established throughout China.

	The article emphasizes: The Communist Party of China is a revolutionary party built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party of China has become even purer, and those counter-revolutionary revisionist elements have been eliminated. The number one figure among these people, Liu Shaoqi, has been permanently expelled from the Party as an enemy of the people, which is a good thing.

	The article states: "The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has frightened all kinds of revisionists, which is easy to understand, because the Cultural Revolution has sounded the death knell for them."

	The article concludes: "To thoroughly understand Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to seriously study the classics of communism, and to strengthen the Marxist-Leninist Party is the duty of every revolutionary."

    比利时左派刊物《光明》热情赞扬中共八届十二中全会公报
    欢呼中国文化大革命取得辉煌胜利
    强调文化大革命敲响修正主义者的丧钟，吓破了他们的胆
    新华社九日讯　比利时左派刊物《光明》周刊不久前发表文章，欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表，热情赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命在我们的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下取得了辉煌胜利。
    文章说：“生活和战斗在比利时的马克思列宁主义者非常重视中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表。”
    文章指出：在苏联，修正主义者能够背叛十月革命和社会主义，这对我们来说，是迫使我们经常研究的一个问题。中国的无产阶级文化大革命对这个问题作出了恰当的回答。文章赞扬这次革命赢得了惊人的胜利，无产阶级专政得到了加强，资产阶级及其代言人的阴谋被粉碎了。现在，除了尚被美帝国主义者占领的台湾以外，中国各地都建立了革命委员会。
    文章强调指出：中国共产党是一个建立在马克思列宁主义理论基础上的革命党。经过这场无产阶级文化大革命，中国共产党更加纯洁了，那些反革命修正主义分子则被清除了。这伙人当中的头号人物刘少奇作为人民的敌人，被永远清除出党，这是一件好事。
    文章写道：“无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，使各种各样的修正主义分子吓破了胆，这是很容易理解的，因为文化大革命给他们敲响了丧钟。”
    文章最后说：“透彻了解马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，认真学习共产主义的经典著作，加强马克思列宁主义的党，这是每个革命者的义务。”
