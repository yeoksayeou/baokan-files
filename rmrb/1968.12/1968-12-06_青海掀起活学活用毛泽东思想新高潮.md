Qinghai has launched a new wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Across the province, cities and countryside have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes focused on learning and implementing the communiqué. Revolutionary workers, people of all ethnic groups, and revolutionary cadres are using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to continue the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and struggle, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, XINING, DEC. 5 — The revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai Plateau, in the process of deeply studying and repeatedly propagating the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and implementing the great and glorious tasks proposed by the plenum, under the great encouragement of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the brilliant report of Chairman Mao at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee, are enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao, praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and praising Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are fiercely criticizing the treasonous, spying, and capitalist-roading crimes of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, and have launched a magnificent wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary criticism and struggle throughout the province.

After the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, factories, offices, schools, and people's communes in cities and countryside across Qinghai Province have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes focused on learning and implementing the communiqué. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels and revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups, while studying the communiqué, reviewed the more than two-year-long battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, linked the struggle in their departments and units, recalled the suffering under the persecution of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and thought of the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They discussed the great domestic and international situation and Chairman Mao's great achievements, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's heinous counter-revolutionary crimes. This further raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses.

Many leaders of revolutionary committees in various units, while studying and implementing the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, reviewed and summarized the more than two-year-long struggle practice of their units with the masses. They deeply felt that the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses overthrew the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, relying on Mao Zedong Thought; consolidating the newly born revolutionary committees, seizing power for the proletariat, and using power for the proletariat, also rely on Mao Zedong Thought. They believe that in everything, the most fundamental thing is to implement Chairman Mao's instructions in various works and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through summarizing experiences, finding gaps, and taking measures, they further carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are determined to further study the historical experience of the two-line struggle within the Party, raise the consciousness of carrying out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle more deeply, to thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, and thoroughly eliminate its poison.

The workers of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation System Automobile Team responded to the battle call of the plenum, continuing to deepen the revolutionary criticism and struggle, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's promotion of "material incentives" and "profit-first" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. The broad revolutionary workers further launched a new wave of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, determined to firmly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On the vast grasslands and in the countryside, people of all ethnic groups and revolutionary cadres set up revolutionary criticism and struggle battlefields in pastures and fields, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "class struggle extinction theory," "exploitation is meritorious," and "three selfs and one package" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. They thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, consciously studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and launched a new wave of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

    全省城乡普遍办起了以学习、落实公报为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班；广大革命工人、各族农牧民和革命干部，以毛泽东思想为武器，继续深入开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线
    新华社西宁五日电　青海高原上的各族革命群众在深入学习和反复宣传党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务中，在毛主席最新指示和毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的光辉报告重新发表的巨大鼓舞下，热情赞颂伟大领袖毛主席，赞颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，赞颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙的叛党叛国罪行，在全省掀起了波澜壮阔的活学活用毛泽东思想和革命大批判的新高潮。
    党的十二中全会公报发表后，青海省城乡各工厂、机关、学校和人民公社普遍办起了以学习、落实全会公报为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习班的各级革命委员会成员和各族革命群众，在学习公报时，回顾了两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，联系本部门、本单位的斗争实际，回忆受叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，思毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜；大谈国内外的大好形势和毛主席的丰功伟绩，狠批刘少奇的反革命滔天罪行。进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    许多单位革命委员会的领导成员，在学习和落实党的十二中全会公报中，和群众一起检查、总结了本单位两年多来的斗争实践。他们深深体会到：亿万革命群众打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙，靠的是毛泽东思想；巩固新生的革命委员会，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，同样靠毛泽东思想。他们认为，千落实，万落实，最根本的就是要在各项工作中落实毛主席的指示，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们通过总结经验，找出差距，订出措施，进一步开展无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，决心进一步学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，提高贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，更深入地开展革命大批判，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义路线批臭，彻底肃清其流毒。
    青海省交通系统汽车队的工人，坚决响应全会提出的战斗号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，狠批刘少奇推行的“物质刺激”
  “利润挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货。广大革命工人进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动新高潮，决心牢牢掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    在辽阔的草原和农村，各族农牧民和革命干部，在牧场、田头大摆革命大批判战场，狠批刘少奇所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”等反革命修正主义谬论。他们大破刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。
