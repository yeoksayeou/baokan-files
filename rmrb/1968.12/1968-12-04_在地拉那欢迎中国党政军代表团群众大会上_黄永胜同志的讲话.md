Comrade Huang Yongsheng's Speech at the Mass Rally in Tirana Welcoming the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation

New China News Agency, Tirana, December 2 -- The full text of Comrade Huang Yongsheng's speech at the mass rally in Tirana welcoming the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation is as follows:

Dear Comrade Mehmet Shehu, dear Comrade Hysni Kapo, dear Comrade Beqir Balluku, dear comrades:

The Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, at the invitation of the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and under the commission of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, has been in heroic Albania for six days. We have celebrated together the great anniversary of the 24th year of Albania's liberation. We have visited your glorious capital, Tirana, the "Hero City" of Vlora, and the historic city of Berat. We have toured factories and military units and met with the broad masses of the Albanian working people and the soldiers and officers of the Albanian People's Army. Today, we are participating in this grand gathering filled with proletarian revolutionary friendship, and we feel very happy.

Please allow me to convey the highest respects and warmest greetings from the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, to the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Please convey the highest respects and warmest greetings from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Chinese Government, and the Central Military Commission to the Albanian Labor Party, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Albanian People's Army. Please convey the highest respects and warmest greetings from the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the people of Tirana and all the Albanian people.

From the moment we set foot on your soil, we have been immersed in the ocean of Sino-Albanian friendship. Everywhere we go, we receive the most enthusiastic welcome, and everywhere we hear the cheers of "Enver-Ho Chi Minh!" and "Mao Zedong-Enver!" This most vividly and concretely embodies the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between our two parties, our two peoples, our two governments, and our two armies. We are deeply moved and express our heartfelt thanks to you.

During the Second World War, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party (now the Labor Party) headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, raised the banner of armed struggle, relied on their own strength, drove out the Italian-German fascist occupiers, and established a people's government.

After liberation, the Albanian people, with great revolutionary spirit, held a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, advancing boldly along the socialist road. You have smashed the restoration plots of the overthrown exploiting classes, overcome the subversive and sabotage activities of imperialism, modern revisionism, and their lackeys. You have completed three five-year plans and are successfully implementing the targets set by the fourth five-year plan. In just 24 years, you have transformed backward and impoverished Albania into a thriving socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture.

In recent years, the glorious Albanian Labor Party has adhered to the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line, leading the entire people to carry out a mass revolutionary movement. In this movement, you have waged class struggle, emphasized proletarian politics, opposed bureaucratism, and launched fierce attacks on all enemies of socialism and all exploitative class ideas. You have implemented the mass line, insisted on cadres participating in labor, armed the broad masses with Marxism-Leninism, and promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. This year, Comrade Enver Hoxha proposed the educational revolution and the supervision of the working class, further enriching the content of the revolutionary movement. Today, in your "Land of the Eagles," there is a revolutionary scene everywhere. Your party, your army, and your people are united, full of vigor and fighting spirit, determined to carry the socialist revolution to the end. This revolutionary movement is of profound and far-reaching significance for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the outstanding contribution made by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism. The great socialist beacon of Albania is shining brighter and brighter in Europe, illuminating the path forward for revolutionary people.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have always held high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, waging resolute struggles against imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries, achieving one victory after another. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people are principled, fearless, daring to struggle, and daring to win, setting a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of the world. Recently, you resolutely condemned the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's blatant use of the Warsaw Pact to invade Czechoslovakia and solemnly declared withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. This revolutionary action is a great encouragement to the revolutionary struggles of the Soviet people and the peoples of Eastern European countries and a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, which is eager to engage in counter-revolutionary deals with the U.S. imperialists.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has long betrayed the great Lenin and Stalin, betrayed the great October Socialist Revolution, and betrayed the Soviet people and the peoples of Eastern European countries. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique brazenly sent hundreds of thousands of troops to occupy Czechoslovakia, implementing naked aggression policies, fully exposing its counter-revolutionary face, and declaring the complete bankruptcy of modern revisionism. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is a social imperialist, a social fascist. It is the new tsar riding on the heads of the Soviet people and the peoples of Eastern European countries. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys are the vicious enemies of the Soviet people and the peoples of Eastern European countries.

After occupying Czechoslovakia, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique sent its troops into Bulgaria, tightening its control over Bulgaria, and sent its fleet into the Mediterranean, threatening the security of the socialist Albanian people and the peoples of the Balkan countries, and further betraying the peoples of the Middle East. In Asia, the Soviet revisionists are provoking incidents on the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders and further intensifying their counter-revolutionary collusion with the U.S. imperialists and the Indian reactionaries, forming an anti-China encirclement. All this does not indicate the strength of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique but only shows its weakness. The tricks of the Soviet revisionists are nothing new to the Albanian people and the Chinese people. The Albanian people and the Chinese people have long seen through the Soviet revisionists, just like the U.S. imperialists, as paper tigers. If they dare to invade Albania and China, they will only face utter, shameful, and irreversible defeat.

Comrades, imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor clique are riddled with contradictions, disintegrating, besieged internally and externally, and at their wits' end. However, they are not willing to admit defeat. They are colluding with each other and vying with each other, attempting to redivide the world. The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam has received the tacit approval and support of the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's open military occupation of Czechoslovakia has received the tacit approval and support of the U.S. imperialists. They are mutually supporting each other, playing a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, alternately carrying out military suppression and political deception, all to maintain and expand their spheres of influence and control their so-called allied countries. The aggressive actions of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have caused dissatisfaction and panic among their partners, deepening the internal contradictions within the imperialist and revisionist camps, and the struggle for control and counter-control has become more intense.

The aggressive actions of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have greatly promoted the awakening of the oppressed peoples within their countries and sparked greater resistance from the revolutionary peoples of the world. In the United States, the masses have for the first time taken to the streets to protest the big swindle of the U.S. presidential "election." In the Soviet Union, the "Stalin Group" has raised the banner of overthrowing the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and restoring the dictatorship of the proletariat. In Czechoslovakia, the masses have continuously held demonstrations and protests against the Soviet revisionist military occupation. In West Berlin, the youth have held demonstrations and protests with the slogan "U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are the main enemies of the people of the world." A new great wave of struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is rising.

Now, the world revolution has entered a great new era. Let us, the peoples of China and Albania, unite! Let all true Marxist-Leninists of the world unite! Let all peoples oppressed by U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys unite! Let us form a broad united front to smash the plots of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to dominate the world, to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and to advance bravely!

Comrades:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, has achieved great and decisive victories. The recent 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the great revolutionary practices since the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee and pointed out the course for achieving complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism. Over the past two years, the people of the whole country, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have, with the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought held high, smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, which attempted to usurp the Party, the government, and the army, and their agents in various places, and have seized back the power they usurped. The Central Cultural Revolution Group has played an important role in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Now, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, achieving a red sun that never sets.

Liu Shaoqi is a traitor, spy, and scab buried within the Communist Party of China, a criminal who is the running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. He is not only the enemy of the Chinese people but also the enemy of the revolutionary people of the world. This plenary session unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, remove all his Party and state positions, and continue to expose the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the Party and the country. This resolution represents the most fundamental interests and the strongest wishes of the Chinese people and has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of the world.

At present, our entire Party is more united than ever. The billion people of the whole country, inspired and encouraged by the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and are advancing bravely to accomplish the tasks of the struggle, criticism, and transformation stages proposed by Chairman Mao, to welcome the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and to achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has received the firm support of the Albanian Labor Party, government, people's army, and people from the very beginning. The recent plenary session of our Party and the communiqué issued have once again received your enthusiastic praise. We express our heartfelt thanks for this.

The revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the two parties, the two peoples, the two governments, and the two armies of China and Albania have been tested by fierce international class struggles and are based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

The friendship and unity between the two parties, the two peoples, the two governments, and the two armies of China and Albania are the greatest friendship and unity in the world. The great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Enver Hoxha, pointed out that true Marxist-Leninist unity is an invincible force that is not limited by distance and can achieve victory. The recent visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Beqir Balluku to China and the current visit of the Chinese Party, government, and military delegation to Albania have further strengthened our friendship and unity. We believe that the friendship and unity between the two parties, the two peoples, the two governments, and the two armies of China and Albania will be further strengthened and consolidated in the future struggle against our common enemies. No matter what the situation, we will unite, fight, and win together.

Finally, let us raise the following slogans:

Long live the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the two parties, the two peoples, the two governments, and the two armies of China and Albania!

Long live the hardworking and brave Albanian people!

Long live the heroic Albanian People's Army!

Long live the glorious Albanian Labor Party!

Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!

    在地拉那欢迎中国党政军代表团群众大会上
    黄永胜同志的讲话
    新华社地拉那二日电　黄永胜同志在地拉那欢迎中国党政军代表团群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的穆罕默德·谢胡同志，亲爱的希斯尼·卡博同志，亲爱的贝基尔·巴卢库同志，亲爱的同志们：
    中国党政军代表团应以阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府的邀请，受到我们党的伟大领袖毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友林彪同志的委托，来到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，已经六天了。我们同兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一起欢庆了阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年的伟大节日。我们访问了你们光荣的首都地拉那、“英雄城”发罗拉和历史名城培拉特，参观了工厂和部队，会见了广大的阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民和人民军指战员。今天，我们又参加你们这个洋溢着无产阶级革命友谊的盛大集会，感到十分高兴。
    请允许我向阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民军，向地拉那市人民和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，转达中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席的最崇高的敬意和最亲切的问候，转达中国共产党中央委员会、中央文革、中国政府、中央军委的最崇高的敬意和最亲切的问候，转达中国人民和中国人民解放军的最崇高的敬意和最亲切的问候。
    从踏上你们国土的第一天起，我们就沉浸在中阿友谊的海洋之中，到处都受到极为热情的欢迎，到处都听到“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“毛泽东—恩维尔！”的欢呼。这最集中地、最生动地体现了我们两党、两国人民、两国政府和两国军队的革命友谊和战斗团结。我们深深受到感动，我们向你们表示衷心的感谢。
    在第二次世界大战期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚共产党（即今日劳动党）的领导下，高举武装斗争的旗帜，依靠自己的力量，赶走了意大利—德国法西斯占领者，建立了人民政权。
    解放后，阿尔巴尼亚人民发扬大无畏的革命精神，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，沿着社会主义的大道奋勇前进。你们粉碎了被推翻了的剥削阶级的复辟阴谋，战胜了帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗的颠覆、破坏活动。你们完成了三个五年计划，并且正在顺利地实现第四个五年计划规定的指标。在短短的二十四年中，你们把贫穷落后的阿尔巴尼亚，建设成为欣欣向荣的具有现代工业和集体农业的先进的社会主义国家。
    近几年来，光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚持马克思列宁主义革命路线，领导全国人民，开展了一场群众性的革命化运动。在这个运动中，你们开展阶级斗争，突出无产阶级政治，反对官僚主义，向一切社会主义敌人和一切剥削阶级思想展开猛烈的进攻。你们贯彻群众路线，坚持干部参加劳动，用马克思列宁主义武装广大群众，促进人的思想革命化。今年，恩维尔·霍查同志又提出教育革命和工人阶级监督的主张，进一步丰富了革命化运动的内容。今天，在你们“山鹰之国”到处都是一片革命景象。你们的党、你们的军队、你们的人民团结一致，意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心将社会主义革命进行到底。这场革命化运动，对于巩固无产阶级专政，具有深远的重大意义。这是阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志对丰富和发展马克思列宁主义所作出的卓越贡献。阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大社会主义明灯正在放射出越来越灿烂的光辉，照亮了革命人民前进的道路。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，一贯高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的革命大旗，同美国为首的帝国主义、苏修为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派进行了针锋相对的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，坚持原则，不畏强暴，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，为世界革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。不久前，你们坚决谴责苏修叛徒集团公然利用华沙条约武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克的滔天罪行，并且庄严宣布退出华沙条约。这一革命行动，对于苏联人民和东欧各国人民的革命斗争是巨大的鼓舞，对于热衷于同美帝搞反革命交易的苏修叛徒集团是沉重的打击。
    苏修叛徒集团早就背叛了伟大的列宁和斯大林，早就背叛了伟大的十月社会主义革命，早就背叛了苏联人民和东欧各国人民。苏修叛徒集团悍然出动几十万军队占领捷克斯洛伐克，实行赤裸裸的侵略政策，完全暴露它的反革命面目，宣告了现代修正主义的总破产。苏修叛徒集团是社会帝国主义者、社会法西斯主义者。它是骑在苏联人民和东欧各国人民头上的新沙皇。苏修叛徒集团及其走狗是苏联人民和东欧各国人民的凶恶敌人。
    苏修叛徒集团在占领捷克斯洛伐克以后，又把它的军队开进保加利亚，加紧对保加利亚的控制，还把舰队开进地中海，威胁社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和巴尔干各国人民的安全，并且加紧出卖中东各国人民。在亚洲，苏修在中苏和中蒙边界进行挑衅，并进一步加紧同美帝和印度反动派的反革命勾结，拼凑反华包围圈。这一切决不表明苏修叛徒集团的强大，只不过是表现它的虚弱。苏修的这一套，对于阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民说来，已经不是什么新鲜玩艺。阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民早已看清楚了苏修同美帝一样，都是纸老虎。如果他们胆敢侵犯阿尔巴尼亚和中国，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    同志们：以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义，他们矛盾重重，分崩离析，内外交困，走投无路，日子越来越不好过。但是他们是不甘心失败的。他们正在互相勾结，又互相争夺，妄图重新瓜分世界。美帝国主义对越南进行的侵略战争，得到了苏修的默契和支持。苏修叛徒集团公开出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，得到了美帝的默契和支持。他们相互策应，大肆玩弄反革命两手策略，交替进行军事镇压和政治欺骗，都是为了保持和扩大他们的势力范围，控制他们的所谓同盟国家。美帝和苏修的侵略行动，引起了他们伙伴的不满和恐慌，加深了帝国主义集团和修正主义集团的内部矛盾，控制和反控制的斗争更加激烈了。
    美帝和苏修的侵略行动，大大促进了他们国内被压迫人民的觉悟，激起了世界各国革命人民的更大反抗。在美国，人民群众第一次走上街头反对美国总统“选举”的大骗局。在苏联，“斯大林小组”举起了打倒苏修叛徒集团统治、重建无产阶级专政的旗帜。在捷克斯洛伐克，人民群众连续举行示威游行，反对苏修武装占领。在西柏林，青年们高举“美帝和苏修是全世界人民的主要敌人”的标语游行示威。一个反对美帝、苏修的新的伟大的斗争高潮，正在兴起。
    现在，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。让我们中阿两国人民团结起来，全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者团结起来，一切被美帝、苏修和他们的走狗所压迫的人民团结起来，结成一个广泛的统一战线，为彻底粉碎美帝、苏修妄图霸占世界的阴谋，彻底推翻帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反动统治而奋勇前进吧！
    同志们：
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动、亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。中国共产党最近召开的第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会，总结了我党八届十一中全会以来的伟大革命实践，指出了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的航向。
    毛泽东同志指出，这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。两年多来，全国人民高举马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的妄图篡党、篡政、篡军的资产阶级司令部及其在各地的代理人，夺回了被他们篡夺的那一部分权力。中央文化革命小组在贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的斗争中，起了重要的作用。现在，全国除台湾省外，二十九个省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会，实现了全国山河一片红。
    刘少奇是一个埋藏在中国共产党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼，是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗。他不仅是中国人民的死敌，也是世界革命人民的死敌。这次全会一致通过决议：把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。这个决议，集中地代表了中国人民最根本的利益和最强烈的愿望，也得到世界革命人民的热烈欢呼。
    目前，我们全党空前团结，全国亿万人民群众，在党的八届十二中全会公报的号召和鼓舞下，满怀革命豪情，正在为实现毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，为迎接中国共产党第九次代表大会，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，而奋勇前进。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，一开始就得到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府、人民军和阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚决支持。我们党最近召开的全会和发表的公报，又最先得到你们的热烈赞扬。对此，我们表示最衷心的感谢。
    中阿两党、两国人民、两国政府、两国军队的革命友谊和战斗团结，是经过激烈的国际阶级斗争考验的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的。
    中阿两党、两国人民、两国政府和两国军队的友谊和团结是世界上最伟大的友谊和团结。伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志指出，真正的马克思列宁主义的团结是永远不可战胜的、不受遥远距离限制而发挥威力和取得胜利的力量。以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团不久前访问中国和中国党政军代表团这次访问阿尔巴尼亚，进一步加强了我们的友谊和团结。我们相信，中阿两党、两国人民、两国政府和两国军队的友谊和团结，在今后反对共同敌人的斗争中必将得到进一步的加强和巩固。不论在什么情况下，我们都将团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    最后让我们高呼：
    中阿两党、两国人民、两国政府、两国军队之间的革命友谊和战斗团结万岁！
    勤劳勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军万岁！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
