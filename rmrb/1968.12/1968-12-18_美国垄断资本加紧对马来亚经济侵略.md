Since the 1959 agreement signed between the United States and the Rahman puppet regime to "guarantee American investments," U.S. monopoly capital has been continuously expanding its investments in Malaya. The U.S. Esso Oil Company invested $15 million to build a refinery in Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan, which has become the largest industrial enterprise on the Malayan mainland. In 1966 alone, this U.S. oil company extracted a pure profit of $2.3 million from the sale of petroleum products in Malaya.

The United States is even more ambitious in expanding its economic influence in Singapore.

Currently, the U.S. investment in Singapore alone amounts to 185 million Malayan dollars, which is more than the total U.S. investment in the entire Malaya region of $60 million (approximately 180 million Malayan dollars) at the end of 1962. The U.S. is making every effort to utilize Singapore's deep-water ports and cheap labor to establish an economic aggression base there. Recently, the U.S. Esso Oil Company has reached an agreement with the Singapore authorities to invest 200 million Malayan dollars in building a refinery in Singapore. According to recent announcements, U.S. monopoly capital also plans to establish fertilizer packaging plants and watch component factories in Singapore.

### 美国垄断资本加紧对马来亚经济侵略

    美国垄断资本加紧对马来亚经济侵略
    自从一九五九年美国同拉赫曼傀儡集团签订了所谓“保障美国投资”的协定以来，美国垄断资本就不断扩大对马来亚的投资。美国埃索石油公司投资一千五百万美元在森美兰波德申建立的一家炼油厂，成了马来亚大陆最大的工业企业。仅在一九六六年，这家美国石油公司在马来亚销售石油产品上就榨取了纯利二百三十万美元。
    美国对于在新加坡扩张它的经济势力，更是野心勃勃。
    目前，美国仅在新加坡一地的投资额就达到马来亚币一亿八千五百万元，这比一九六二年底美国在全马来亚的投资总额六千万美元（约合马来亚币一亿八千万元）还要多。美国正在极力利用新加坡的深水港口和廉价劳动力等有利条件，在那里建立一个经济侵略据点。最近，美国埃索石油公司已经同新加坡当局达成协议，将要在新加坡投资二亿元（马来亚币），建立一个炼油厂。据最近宣布，美国垄断资本还要在新加坡设立肥料包装厂和钟表附件厂。
