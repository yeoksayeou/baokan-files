In the midst of the great struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform, Jiangxi Province has seen batch after batch of cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, medical personnel, and urban residents move to the countryside to settle down. The masses unanimously reflect that this is a glorious deed. The change in public opinion has greatly boosted the morale of rural cadres fighting in the countryside and increased the determination of rural youth to take root in the countryside.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 25th: In the great struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform, Jiangxi Province has already seen batch after batch of cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, medical personnel, and other urban residents, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, rush to the front lines of agricultural production, settling down in the countryside. They are actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and various collective production activities in the vast rural areas, sincerely accepting re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, and playing an increasingly significant role in the great cause of building socialist new rural areas.

After the great directive by Chairman Mao, "A large number of cadres should go to the countryside to work. This is an excellent opportunity for cadres to learn anew. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go to the countryside in batches to work," was issued, it greatly inspired the broad revolutionary cadres. They regard going to the countryside to work as the greatest care from Chairman Mao for revolutionary cadres, as an excellent opportunity to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to achieve ideological transformation. Starting from mid-October, the entire province has seen batch after batch of cadres, teachers, medical personnel, and other urban residents successively move to the countryside to settle down and become ordinary farmers. Following the cadres, graduates of colleges and universities, urban youth, workers' family members, and idle urban labor force have also flocked to the countryside to settle down and participate in the socialist construction of the countryside.

When the people who moved to the countryside to settle down arrived, the poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed, welcoming them with drums and gongs as if celebrating a joyous event. They cared for the relocated personnel in every aspect of politics, ideology, and life.

Revitalizing revolutionary youthfulness, promoting ideological transformation

Following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, the people who moved to the countryside to settle down in Jiangxi Province regard re-learning in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, accepting re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly transforming their worldview as their fundamental task. In a short period, their spiritual appearance has undergone profound changes.

Some revolutionary old cadres, after coming to the countryside, have once again regained the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the war years. An old cadre who joined the Red Army at the age of fifteen fought bravely alongside Chairman Mao in the war years. After moving to the city, he became an official and enjoyed better living conditions, which fostered a stagnant and unprogressive attitude. This time, he was relocated to a production brigade under Jian'gan Mountain to be an ordinary commune member, living in a house that was once used by the red political power organs, and working alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants. He sighed, "More than thirty years ago, Chairman Mao saved me from the hell of the old society; today, it is Chairman Mao who has saved me from the mud of revisionism. Only by following Chairman Mao's words, not leaving the masses, and not leaving labor, can one forever preserve revolutionary youthfulness." A leading cadre who participated in the revolution during the Anti-Japanese War was this time relocated to a region where he had once served as a county magistrate in the early days of liberation. The poor and lower-middle peasants warmly welcomed him home, saying, "The old county magistrate is back!" He put down his luggage and, just like in the old days, picked up a hoe and went to the fields with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Some cadres who went from the family gate to the school gate and then to the official gate, this time went to the countryside to work and, after coming into contact with reality, strengthened their proletarian feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants and their sense of labor. Some, under the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, put down their airs and humbly learned from the masses, making contributions to the socialist construction of the countryside.

The propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, the vanguard of building new rural areas

The people who moved to the countryside to settle down are spread throughout the province, becoming a powerful vanguard for the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the countryside. With their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they spread Chairman Mao's latest series of directives to every corner of the province, further promoting the development of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside. In some remote mountainous areas in western Jiangxi, due to inconvenient transportation, the poor and lower-middle peasants could not timely hear Chairman Mao's voice. Now, with the arrival of a large number of relocated personnel, Chairman Mao's voice is spread quickly, Chairman Mao's directives are implemented well, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon every hamlet. Now, a lively scene of studying Chairman Mao's works has emerged, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have a completely new appearance.

The people who moved to the countryside to settle down firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle" and "grasp revolution, promote production," and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, unremittingly grasp class struggle, launch large-scale production struggles and scientific experiments, further consolidating the socialist position in the countryside. Medical personnel relocated to the countryside have sincerely transformed themselves into "barefoot doctors" needed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, contributing to changing the medical and health conditions in the countryside.

Deep political impact, significant social changes

"Urban residents move to the countryside to become farmers, changing social morals!" This is the unanimous reflection of the masses in various places after a large number of cadres, teachers, medical staff, educated youth, and urban residents rushed to the countryside. In the past, some people regarded moving to the countryside to settle down as a dishonorable thing. Now, with the relocation of a large number of cadres to the countryside, people have new understandings. The change in public opinion has not only greatly boosted the morale of the broad rural grassroots cadres fighting in the countryside but also greatly increased the determination of rural youth to take root in the countryside.

Among the urban population that moved to the countryside to settle down, there are many who have been urban residents for generations. A batch of "urban residents" who settled down in the Xincheng County Jiancun Commune saw the good situation in the countryside, received profound education, and wrote letters to their urban relatives and neighbors, telling them about the new people, new things, and new scenes in the countryside, and led many "urban residents" who had left labor to move to the countryside. They said, "We want to be glorious producers and will no longer eat idle meals in the city." In many cities and towns, there appeared moving scenes of parents sending their sons and mothers sending their daughters to the countryside to become farmers.

The relocation of a large number of people to the countryside and their significant changes in spiritual appearance, in turn, promoted the revolutionization of organs, enterprises, and schools, and pushed forward the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform in various fields of the superstructure. Many organs, schools, and hospitals, through the fresh air constantly brought back by the relocated personnel, more powerfully swept away all old ideas and habits, promoted the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform in their units, and appeared many new situations.

    “城里人下乡当农民，社会风气变了”
    江西大批干部、革命师生、医务人员和城镇居民到农村安家落户，群众一致反映这是光荣的事。社会舆论的改变，大长了农村干部奋战农村的志气，大增了农村青年扎根农村的决心
    据新华社南昌二十五日电　在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，江西省已经有一批又一批的干部、革命师生、医务人员和其他城镇居民，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，奔赴农业生产第一线，到农村安家落户。他们在广大农村积极参加无产阶级文化大革命和各项集体生产劳动，认真接受贫下中农的再教育，在建设社会主义新农村的伟大事业中日益发挥出巨大的作用。
    伟大领袖毛主席“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动”的伟大指示发表后，给广大革命干部以巨大鼓舞。他们把下放劳动看成是毛主席对革命干部的最大关怀，是自己接受工农兵的再教育，实现思想革命化的极好机会。从十月中旬开始，全省一批又一批的干部、教员、医务人员，陆续下放到农村安家落户，当普通农民。在干部的带动下，大中学校应届毕业生、社会青年、职工家属和社会闲散劳动力等城镇人口，也纷纷到农村安家落户，参加农村社会主义建设。
    到农村安家落户的人员来到农村，贫下中农欢欣鼓舞，象办喜事一样，敲锣打鼓地热情迎接。他们从政治、思想、生活各个方面热情关怀下放人员。
  焕发了革命的青春活力，促进了思想革命化
    遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，江西省到农村安家落户的人员，把在农村三大革命运动中重新学习，接受贫下中农的再教育，彻底改造世界观作为自己的根本任务。他们在短短的时间里，精神面貌就发生了深刻的变化。
    一些革命老干部来到农村后，又重新焕发出战争年代那种旺盛的革命精神。一个十五岁时参加红军的老干部，在战争年代斗志昂扬，跟随毛主席南征北战。进城以后，他官做大了，生活条件好了，滋长了停顿起来不求进步的情绪。这次下放到井冈山下的生产队当普通社员，住到当年红色政权机关用过的一幢民房里，和贫下中农一同参加生产劳动。他感慨地说：“三十多年前，毛主席把我从旧社会的火坑里救出来；今天，又是毛主席把我从修正主义的泥坑里挽救出来。只有听毛主席的话，不脱离群众，不脱离劳动，才能永葆革命青春。”一个抗日战争时期参加革命的领导干部，这次下放到解放初期他曾在那里当过县长的地区，贫下中农亲切地把他接到家里说：“老县长又回来啦！”他一放下行李，就象当年那样，扛起锄头和贫下中农一起下地。
    一些由家门到学校门又到机关门的“三门”干部，这次下放到农村参加劳动，接触实际后，增强了对贫下中农的无产阶级感情和劳动观念。有些人在贫下中农的教育下，放下架子虚心向群众学习，为农村的社会主义建设事业作出了贡献。
    毛泽东思想的宣传队，建设新农村的生力军
    到农村安家落户的人员遍及全省，成了农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一支强大的生力军。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，把毛主席的一系列最新指示传播到全省的各个角落，进一步推动了农村活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的发展。赣西一些边远山区，过去因为交通不便，贫下中农不能及时听到毛主席的声音。现在大批下放人员来到这里，毛主席的声音传播快，毛主席的指示落实好，毛泽东思想的光辉普照每一个山庄。现在，这里出现一片学习毛主席著作的热烈景象，贫下中农精神面貌焕然一新。
    到农村安家落户的人员，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，同贫下中农一道坚持不懈地狠抓阶级斗争，大规模地开展生产斗争和科学实验，更加巩固了农村社会主义阵地。下放农村的医务人员，认真把自己改造成为贫下中农所需要的“赤脚医生”，为改变农村的医疗卫生面貌贡献力量。
                  深刻的政治影响，巨大的社会变化
    “城里人下乡当农民，社会风气变了！”这是随着大批干部、教师、医护人员和知识青年、城镇居民开赴农村后，各地群众的一致反映。过去，有些人把到农村安家落户看成是一件不光荣的事。现在随着大批干部下放农村，人们有了新的认识。社会舆论的改变，既大长了广大农村基层干部奋战农村的志气，也大增了农村青年扎根农村的决心。
    到农村安家落户的城镇人口中，有许多是世代的“城里人”。在奉新县渣村公社落户的一批“城里人”，看到农村的大好形势，受到深刻的教育，就写信把农村的新人、新事、新景象告诉城里的亲友邻舍，带动了许多脱离劳动的“城里人”迁往农村。他们说：“我们要做光荣的生产者，再也不在城里吃闲饭了。”在许多城镇里，出现了父送子、母送女下乡当农民的动人情景。
    大批人员到农村安家落户和他们精神面貌的巨大变化，反过来又促进了机关、企业、学校的革命化，推动了上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改。许多机关、学校、医院，通过下放人员这条渠道经常传来的新鲜空气，更加有力地横扫着一切旧的思想意识和习惯势力，推动本单位的斗、批、改，出现了许多新的气象。
