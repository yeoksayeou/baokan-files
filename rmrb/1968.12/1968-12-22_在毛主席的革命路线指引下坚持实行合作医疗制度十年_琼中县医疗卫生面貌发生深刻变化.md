Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the cooperative medical system has been implemented for ten years in Qiongzhong County, leading to significant changes in the medical and health conditions.

Now, all thirteen communes in the county have implemented the cooperative medical system. The broad masses of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Li and Miao ethnic groups praise it, saying, "The cooperative medical system is truly good; it is a treasure for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The commune members are strong and vigorous, and their enthusiasm for revolutionary production is high."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Haikou, the broad masses of the Li and Miao ethnic groups in the communes of Qiongzhong County on Hainan Island have, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, persisted in implementing the cooperative medical system for ten years. Now, all thirteen communes in the county have implemented the cooperative medical system. Except for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, all the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members have joined the cooperative medical system.

Qiongzhong County is located in the mountainous and forested interior of Wuzhishan on Hainan Island, where transportation is inconvenient. To improve medical conditions, in 1958, the broad masses of the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants responded to Chairman Mao's call for "People's Communes are good" and, while establishing people's communes, they carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, broke with the old and established the new, and created the cooperative medical system on their own. Ten years of practice have proven that implementing the cooperative medical system in rural areas can: first, timely treat the illnesses of the poor and lower-middle peasants; second, implement Chairman Mao's series of instructions on health work, adhere to the principle of "prevention first," and change the face of rural health work; third, consolidate and develop the collective economy and accelerate socialist construction. After implementing the cooperative medical system, "prevent diseases early, treat minor illnesses early, and rely on it for major illnesses," ensuring the health of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They say, "The cooperative medical system is truly good; it is a treasure for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The commune members are strong and vigorous, and their enthusiasm for revolutionary production is high."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." The cooperative medical system created by the broad masses of the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants in Qiongzhong County has been consolidated and developed through continuous struggle against Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line and a handful of class enemies. The main experiences of Qiongzhong County in consolidating and promoting the cooperative medical system in rural areas are:

1. The poor and lower-middle peasants must firmly grasp the power of rural medical and health work.

In 1958, when Changzheng Commune initially established the cooperative medical system, the power of medical and health work was in the hands of a few capitalist-roaders, who did everything they could to sabotage the cooperative medical system, issuing large prescriptions, referring patients to large hospitals, embezzling medical fees, causing the cooperative medical funds to be in long-term deficit, and attempting to strangle this new thing in its cradle. However, the neighboring Chang'an Commune's Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, launched a struggle against Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line, withstood wave after wave of evil winds, firmly grasped the power of rural medical and health work, and made the cooperative medical system better and better.

The broad masses of the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants in the county learned from the experiences and lessons of Changzheng and Chang'an Communes and deeply felt the importance of grasping power. Therefore, they firmly grasped the power of rural medical and health work, and by 1963, the cooperative medical system had been spread throughout the county.

2. Strengthening political and ideological education is an important guarantee for running the cooperative medical system well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants in Qiongzhong County, in consolidating and developing the cooperative medical system, carried out the "two remembrances, two comparisons, and two grasps" activities. That is: remembering the bitterness of the old society where the poor were oppressed and exploited, comparing the sweetness of the new society where Chairman Mao leads us to liberation, and grasping class education; remembering the hardships of not joining the cooperative medical system, comparing the sweetness of joining the cooperative medical system, and grasping the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, promoting the thought revolution of the poor and lower-middle peasants and medical personnel. In this activity, the broad masses of the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and repudiate Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line, expose and criticize those who sabotaged the cooperative medical system, such as landlords and "Dao Gong," and educate the masses with the good facts of the cooperative medical system. Therefore, the number of commune members joining the cooperative medical system increases year by year.

3. Establishing a new type of health team and improving the rural medical and health network.

Starting from consolidating the cooperative medical system, the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants in Qiongzhong County required those medical personnel who graduated from old schools and worked in the cooperative medical institutions not to stay in the hospitals but to go to the masses. The medical personnel, according to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, often went deep into the Li and Miao villages, living, eating, working, and studying Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, accepting re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly changing their worldview. Many medical personnel saw that the poor and lower-middle peasants loved Chairman Mao, consciously cherished the cooperative medical system, and hated Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line the most, receiving great education. They decided to settle down in the Wuzhishan area and serve the Li and Miao ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants for life.

To better meet the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants for disease prevention and treatment, Qiongzhong County also adopted the methods of centralized training and master-apprentice training, training a total of 646 "barefoot doctors" from the poor and lower-middle peasants, ensuring that each commune has a hospital, each production brigade has a clinic, and each production team has a health worker, improving the rural health network, and forming a health team that can treat diseases with a backpack of medicine and work with a hoe, which has played a significant role in consolidating and developing the cooperative medical system.

    在毛主席的革命路线指引下坚持实行合作医疗制度十年
    琼中县医疗卫生面貌发生深刻变化
    现在全县十三个公社都推广了合作医疗，广大黎族苗族贫下中农称赞说：“合作医疗真是好，贫下中农一件宝，社员身强力又壮，革命生产热气高。”
    据新华社海口电　海南岛琼中县各人民公社的广大黎、苗族贫下中农，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，十年来坚持实行合作医疗制度。现在，全县十三个公社都推广了合作医疗，除地、富、反、坏分子外，广大的黎、苗族贫下中农和社员都参加了合作医疗。
    琼中县位于海南岛山高林密、交通不便的五指山腹地。这里的广大黎、苗族贫下中农为了改善医疗条件，一九五八年响应毛主席“人民公社好”的伟大号召，在办起人民公社的同时，就发扬“自力更生”的革命精神，大破大立，自己创办了合作医疗。十年来的实践证明，农村实行合作医疗制度，一能及时治疗贫下中农的病症。二能落实毛主席关于卫生工作的一系列指示，贯彻“预防为主”的方针，改变农村卫生工作的面貌。三能巩固和发展集体经济，加速社会主义建设。实行合作医疗制度后，“无病早防，小病早治，大病有依靠”，保障了贫下中农的身体健康。他们说：“合作医疗真是好，贫下中农一件宝，社员身强力又壮，革命生产热气高。”
    毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”琼中县广大黎、苗族贫下中农创建的合作医疗制度，是在同刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线和同一小撮阶级敌人不断进行斗争中得到巩固、发展的。琼中县农村巩固、推广合作医疗制度的主要经验是：
    一、贫下中农必须牢牢掌管农村医疗卫生大权。
    一九五八年，长征公社初办合作医疗时，医疗卫生大权掌握在一小撮走资派手里，他们千方百计破坏合作医疗，实行开大处方，转送大医院，并吞医疗费，造成合作医疗资金长期超支，企图将这个新生事物扼杀在摇篮之中。而毗邻的长安公社黎、苗族贫下中农，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，向刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线展开斗争，顶住了一阵阵妖风，牢牢掌握农村医疗卫生大权，使合作医疗越办越好。
    全县黎、苗族广大贫下中农从长征、长安两公社的经验教训中，亲身体会到掌权的重要性。因此，他们牢牢掌握农村医疗卫生大权，使合作医疗制度到一九六三年便在全县铺开。
    二、加强政治思想教育是办好合作医疗的重要保证。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”遵照毛主席的教导，琼中县的黎、苗族贫下中农在巩固、发展合作医疗制度中，开展了“两忆、两比、两抓”活动。即：忆旧社会穷人受压迫受剥削的苦，比新社会毛主席领导翻身得解放的甜，抓阶级教育；忆没有参加合作医疗的苦头，比参加合作医疗的甜头，抓活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，促进贫下中农和医务人员思想革命化。在这一活动中，广大黎、苗族贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，大破刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，揪出破坏合作医疗制度的地主、“道公”等进行批判斗争，用合作医疗好的事实教育群众，因此，参加合作医疗的社员一年比一年多。
    三、建立一支新型的卫生队伍，健全农村医疗卫生网。
    从巩固合作医疗制度出发，琼中县的黎、苗族贫下中农要求那些从旧学校毕业的在合作医疗机构中工作的医务人员，不要老蹲在卫生院里，要到群众里面来。医务人员根据贫下中农的意见，经常深入黎村苗寨和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学毛主席著作，接受贫下中农再教育，彻底改造世界观。很多医务人员看到贫下中农热爱毛主席，自觉地爱护合作医疗制度，最痛恨刘少奇的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，受到很大教育，他们决心在五指山区安家落户，为黎、苗族贫下中农服务一辈子。
    为了更好地满足贫下中农防病治病的需要，琼中县还采取集训和师傅带徒弟的方法，先后培养了贫下中农出身的“赤脚医生”六百四十六人，做到公社有卫生院，大队有卫生所，生产队有卫生员，健全农村卫生网，形成了一支背起药箱能治病，拿起锄头能劳动的卫生队伍，对巩固、发展合作医疗制度起了很大作用。
