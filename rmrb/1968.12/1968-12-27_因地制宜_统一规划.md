This issue focuses on discussing how to manage urban primary schools. It includes experiences of managing schools primarily through neighborhood committees, proposals for suggestions, and differing opinions on neighborhood-managed schools. We hope that readers will continue to discuss this topic.

There are various opinions on who should manage urban primary schools. We believe that no single opinion can be absolutely affirmed. Instead, we should consider the distribution of primary schools in a city and combine this with the specific layout of local factories to make a unified consideration. We should adapt to local conditions and flexibly manage the situation. Schools located in densely populated residential areas can be managed by workers' propaganda teams in collaboration with neighborhood committees. Schools near small factories can be managed jointly by a few small factories. Large and medium-sized factories can independently manage nearby schools. Schools located in suburban areas can be managed by factories if there are any nearby, or jointly by factories and production brigades. Schools managed by factories should also be linked with suburban production brigades to better implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." We suggest that this work should be unified and comprehensively arranged by relevant departments.

    因地制宜　统一规划
    编者按：这一期讨论集中刊登关于城市小学如何办的稿件，其中有以街道为主办小学的经验，有提出建议的，还有对街道办小学的不同意见，希望广大读者继续讨论。
    城市小学究竟由谁办好，大家提出了各种意见。我们认为，不论对哪一种意见都不能作绝对的肯定，应当根据一个城市小学的分布情况，结合当地工厂的具体布局统一考虑，因地制宜地灵活掌握。设在居民集中地区的小学，可由工人宣传队配合街道来办；附近小型工厂较多的小学，可由几家小型工厂联合来办；大中型工厂可单独接管附近的小学；设在郊区的小学，附近有工厂的可由工厂来办，或由工厂与社队联合办。工厂办的小学也应与郊区生产大队挂钩，以便更好地贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示。我们建议，这一工作应由有关部门负责统一规划、全面安排。
