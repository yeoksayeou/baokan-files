In Liaoning Province's Yingkou County, there is a primary school run by poor and lower-middle peasants—the Jianyi Commune Songshu Brigade's People-Run Primary School. Over the past few years, under the cultivation and management of poor and lower-middle peasants, Songshu Primary School has grown healthily along the line of proletarian education advocated by Chairman Mao. It stands tall like a pine tree, deeply rooted in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The following photographs were taken by a reporter from this newspaper.

The students of Songshu Primary School are loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought. They love the collective and love labor. Participating in productive labor is a fundamental course. This is a scene of teachers and students returning from the mountains after gathering firewood.

The teachers and students of Songshu Primary School harbor deep hatred for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. During the criticism meetings, everyone takes part. This is a scene of them criticizing the revisionist educational line together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, determined to thoroughly smash the old educational system and establish a new type of school that truly serves the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Songshu Brigade always remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and frequently use various methods to educate teachers and students about class and class struggle. This is Grandma Ban recounting her family's bitter history during a meal of bitter food.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," the poor and lower-middle peasants selected three teachers from the educated youth who had returned to the countryside. Together with the students, they study the works of Chairman Mao, participate in collective productive labor, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and learn the excellent qualities of the poor and lower-middle peasants through labor.

To make it convenient for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to attend school, Songshu Primary School broke through various rigid rules, made do with what was available, and set up schools in production brigades and at the doors of poor and lower-middle peasants. Without classrooms, the kangs (heated beds) of the commune members served as classrooms, and students could bring their younger siblings to class, which was warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    一所贫下中农掌权的民办小学
    在辽宁省营口县，有一所贫下中农掌权的民办小学——建一公社松树大队民办小学。几年来，松树小学在贫下中农培育和管理下，沿着毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，健康地成长起来了。它象松树一样，巍然挺立，深深地扎根于贫下中农的心中。　本报通讯员摄
    松树小学培养的学生，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，热爱集体，热爱劳动。参加生产劳动是一门基本课。这是师生们上山打柴归来。
    松树小学师生对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇无比仇恨，批判会上人人上阵，这是他们同贫下中农一起批判修正主义教育路线，决心彻底摧毁旧的教育制度，办好真正为贫下中农服务的新型学校。
    松树大队贫下中农牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，经常以各种方式，向教师和学生进行阶级和阶级斗争的教育。这是班大娘在师生吃忆苦饭时忆述血泪家史。
    遵照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导，贫下中农从回乡知识青年中挑选的三名教员，和学生一起学习毛主席著作，一起参加集体生产劳动，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在劳动中学习贫下中农的优秀品质。
    为了方便贫下中农子女上学，松树小学打破了种种清规戒律，因陋就简，分散建点，把学校办到生产队去，办到贫下中农家门上去。没有教室，社员的炕头就是课堂，学生也可以带弟弟妹妹来上课，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
