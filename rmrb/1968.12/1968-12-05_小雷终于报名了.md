Xiao Lei finally enrolled. It was heard that graduates would be assigned to rural areas. Lei Ke, a student from Zhongshan Secondary School, always couldn't understand this, thinking it was like using a telephone pole as chopsticks—overqualified for the job. After the propaganda team stationed at the school repeatedly helped and educated him, Xiao Lei finally understood and decided to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, to unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, during the meeting to express his determination, Xiao Lei just wouldn't enroll for rural areas. The propaganda team member Wen Zhengxian thought, "Has Xiao Lei changed his mind again?" Upon investigation, it turned out that his mother's thoughts were not clear, and she didn't let him enroll. Old Wen immediately realized: the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi not only spread rampantly in schools but also deeply permeated society. If the poison in society is not thoroughly cleansed, the struggle, criticism, and reform movement will not ultimately achieve victory. He, with deep hatred for the traitor Liu Shaoqi, went to Xiao Lei's home. First, he studied Chairman Mao's great instructions on struggle, criticism, and reform with Xiao Lei and his mother. Then, he exposed Liu Shaoqi's mad opposition to Chairman Mao's instructions that young students must unite with workers and peasants, attempting to carry out a capitalist restoration in our country. Lei's mother listened and listened, becoming so angry that she repeatedly raised her fist and shouted, "Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" Old Wen then seized the opportunity to say, "Liu Shaoqi has been thoroughly defeated by us, but the poison of his reactionary thoughts has not been completely cleansed. For example, there is such poison in your mind, Mother." Upon hearing this, Lei's mother was startled and exclaimed, "Someone like me, who has suffered so much and never been to school, could also be poisoned by him?" Old Wen said, "Xiao Lei wants to enroll for rural areas, but you don't understand and don't let him enroll. Isn't this being poisoned by Liu Shaoqi?" Lei's mother then suddenly realized, saying, "If you hadn't opened my eyes, I would have almost dragged Lei into the mire!" Lei's mother pointed at Xiao Lei and said to Old Wen, "Take him away!" Then she told Xiao Lei, "Child, you must follow Chairman Mao and always make revolution!"

Xiao Lei, after hearing Old Wen and his mother's words, couldn't contain his excitement. He grabbed Old Wen's hand and said, "I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, go to the most difficult places, unite with workers and peasants for life, and in the three great revolutionary movements, temper myself into a reliable successor of the proletariat!"

    小雷终于报名了
    听说毕业分配要下农村，湛江二中的学生雷克总是想不通，认为这是电线杆当筷子——大材小用。经过驻校工人宣传队同志多次的帮助和教育，小雷才明白过来，表示决心走毛主席指引的道路，与贫下中农相结合。但是在表决心的会上，小雷却怎么也不报名到农村去。宣传队的温正贤想，难道小雷又变卦了？一了解，原来是他的母亲思想不通，不让他报名。老温马上警觉到：大叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线的毒素不仅在学校里泛滥成灾，而且在社会上也流毒不浅，如果不把社会上的流毒同时肃清，这场斗、批、改运动就不可能最后取得胜利。他怀着对叛徒刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，来到小雷家里，先和小雷、小雷的妈妈一起学习了毛主席有关斗、批、改的伟大指示，接着，他揭露了叛徒刘少奇疯狂反对毛主席关于青年学生必须与工农相结合的指示，妄图在我国搞资本主义复辟的罪行。雷大娘听着听着气愤地连连振臂高呼：“打倒叛徒刘少奇……”老温便因势利导地说：“刘少奇已彻底被我们打垮了，但是他的反动思想的流毒还没有完全肃清，比方大娘的头脑里就有这种流毒”。话一出口，雷大娘怔了一下，吃惊地说：“象我这样的受苦人，又没进过学校，也会中他的毒吗？”老温说：“小雷想报名下农村，你却思想不通，不让他报名，这不是中了刘少奇的毒又是什么？”雷大娘这时才恍然大悟地说：“要不是你给我开窍，我差点儿把雷儿拉入泥坑呢！”雷大娘指着小雷对老温说：“把他带走吧！”接着又对小雷说：“孩子，你一定要跟毛主席永远干革命啊！”
    小雷听了老温和母亲这一席话，按捺不住自己激动的心情，拉着老温的手说：“我一定听毛主席的话，到最艰苦的地方去，和工农结合一辈子，在三大革命运动中把自己锻炼成为无产阶级的可靠接班人！”　梁开强
