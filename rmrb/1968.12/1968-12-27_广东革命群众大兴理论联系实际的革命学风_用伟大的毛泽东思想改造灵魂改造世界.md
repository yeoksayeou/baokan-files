The 40 million people of Guangdong Province, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have, under the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, launched a thorough study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, further igniting a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The class struggle and the struggle between the two lines have reached an unprecedented height among the revolutionary people of the entire province. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This has powerfully promoted the deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and everywhere there is a vigorous revolutionary scene.

In the process of thoroughly studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought that has swept through cities and countryside in Guangdong Province is unprecedented in scale, number of participants, speed of action, and effectiveness. Since the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee in February this year, the province has held more than 1.7 million sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 70 million people participating in the study.

In the new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the most outstanding feature of the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in the entire province is the promotion of the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, which combines theory with practice. They closely link the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party with the actual struggles of their own regions and units. They combine the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines with the struggle, criticism, and transformation, greatly promoting the deep development of the revolutionary construction of revolutionary committees at all levels, the cleansing of the class ranks, the rectification of the party, the streamlining of organizations, the sending of cadres to labor, the reform of unreasonable regulations and systems, and the proletarian cultural revolution, achieving immediate results. The province's criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi is developing on an unprecedented scale.

The broad revolutionary workers who have taken the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure are combining the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the history of the struggle between the two lines with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units. This has further raised their political consciousness and enabled them to play a more active role in leading the cultural revolution and all other work. The workers of the Guangzhou Silk and Hemp Textile Factory have studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, criticized Liu Shaoqi's black goods, and raised their class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to an unprecedented height. They have exposed a handful of deeply hidden class enemies and seized the leadership of factory science and technology from a handful of reactionary technical "authorities." The enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has increased, and they have taken the initiative, based on the needs of revolution and production, to break more than 40 unreasonable regulations that shackle the workers' hands and feet, achieving more than 50 technological innovations.

Another feature of the broad revolutionary masses studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is that they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step and study Chairman Mao's latest instructions well. As soon as Chairman Mao issues a new instruction, they immediately organize study, widely propagate, and promptly implement it. In the process of quickly transmitting Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the province's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda network of more than 3.5 million workers and peasants has played a great role. Many members of county and city revolutionary committees leave to propagate as soon as they hear Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ensuring that the latest instructions are transmitted without delay.

The broad revolutionary people of the entire province are studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls, and their spiritual outlook has been greatly improved. This has powerfully promoted a significant increase in industrial and agricultural production. This year's late-season harvest has achieved a bumper harvest on the basis of consecutive years of increased production. The industrial production situation is getting better and better.

At present, the broad revolutionary people of the entire province are actively preparing to welcome an even greater leap in industrial and agricultural production next year.

    广东革命群众大兴理论联系实际的革命学风 
    用伟大的毛泽东思想改造灵魂改造世界
    据新华社广州二十六日电　广东省四千万人民，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会的伟大号召下，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。全省革命人民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，他们无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展，到处是一片朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
    在更深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，广东省城乡掀起的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，规模之大，参加人数之多，行动之迅速，效果之显著，都是空前的。全省从城市到农村，普遍办起各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，自今年二月省革命委员会成立以来，全省就办了一百七十多万期，有七千多万人次参加了学习。
    全省广大工人、贫下中农、革命干部和革命知识分子，在活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮中，最突出的一个特点，是大兴毛主席一贯倡导的理论和实践相结合的革命学风，紧密联系本地区、本单位的斗争实际，深入学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，把两条路线斗争史的学习同斗、批、改结合起来，大大促进了各级革委会革命化建设、清理阶级队伍、整党建党、精简机构、干部下放劳动、改革不合理规章制度和无产阶级教育革命等项工作的深入开展，收到了立竿见影的效果。全省对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判，正在以前所未有的规模向前发展。
    全省登上上层建筑领域斗、批、改政治舞台的广大革命工人，把活学活用毛泽东思想、学习两条路线斗争史同本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，进一步提高了政治觉悟，更充分地发挥了工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，把斗、批、改推向一个新的高潮。广州绢麻纺织厂的工人，活学活用毛泽东思想，批判了刘少奇的黑货，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，揪出了一小撮隐藏很深的阶级敌人，并从一小撮资产阶级反动技术“权威”手里夺回了工厂科学技术的领导权，广大工人干劲倍增，以主人翁的态度，从革命和生产的需要出发，破除了四十多项束缚工人手脚的各种不合理的规章制度，实现技术革新五十多项。
    广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想的另一个特点，是步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，学好毛主席的一系列最新指示。毛主席的每一个最新指示一发表，他们就马上组织学习，广泛宣传，迅速落实。在迅速传达毛主席的最新指示的过程中，全省拥有三百五十多万人的工农毛泽东思想宣传网发挥了巨大的作用。许多县、市革委会成员，什么时候听到毛主席的最新指示，就什么时候出发宣传，做到传达最新指示不过夜。
    全省广大革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，精神面貌焕然一新，有力地促进了工农业生产大幅度上升，今年晚造在连年大增产的基础上又获得大丰收。工业生产形势越来越好。
    目前，全省广大革命人民正在积极做好准备，迎接明年工农业生产的更大跃进。
