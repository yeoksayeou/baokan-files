The poor peasants of "Dirt-Poor Commune" have their hearts with Chairman Mao

The famous "Dirt-Poor Commune" — Xipu Production Brigade of Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province — has undergone a baptism of fire in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The great thought of Mao Zedong has become even more widespread and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Below are a few small stories about how they study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in their daily lives.

A Heart Red for the Red Sun

The hearts of the "Dirt-Poor" people will forever be with the red sun.

Wang Sheng, an old man from "Dirt-Poor Commune," suffered under the brutal exploitation and oppression of the landlord class in the old society. He was forced to beg for twenty-four years, which ruined his eyesight. It was the great leader Chairman Mao who liberated him and thousands of other "Dirt-Poor" people from their misery and led them onto the broad road of socialism. Wang Sheng often says, "I'm not good with words, but I've grasped one truth: Great Leader Chairman Mao is our savior, the savior of the poor. If the 'Dirt-Poor' want to escape poverty, we must forever follow Great Leader Chairman Mao and build socialism!"

During the Cultural Revolution, he followed Chairman Mao closely and studied Mao Zedong Thought diligently. The print in the books was too small for him to see, so he asked the revolutionary youngsters to copy "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations into a notebook for him. Every night, Wang Sheng would hold the notebook under the lamp, reading and memorizing one character at a time. In this way, over two years, Grandpa Wang finished studying "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and also studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The more he studied, the closer he felt to Chairman Mao. He remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." He actively participated in the Cultural Revolution. Whether it was a criticism meeting or a study session, day or night, he attended every one. Someone advised him, "Grandpa Wang, at your age, with poor eyesight and unsteady legs, just stay at home. The village doesn't need you to worry about its affairs." The old man firmly replied, "Enjoying life in ease? No way! Socialism didn't fall from the sky. We must carry forward the spirit of the 'Dirt-Poor' and follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. If we don't care about the affairs of the state and the collective, those who haven't been reformed — the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists — will seize power!"

He did not listen to others' advice but participated even more actively in the Cultural Revolution.

When Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class — the poor and lower-middle peasants," the brigade selected him as a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the management of Jianming Agricultural Middle School. The old man was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. He said, "Chairman Mao trusts us 'Dirt-Poor' the most. We must make Chairman Mao proud!" In the school, he told the students about his bitter past, educating the young people not to forget their roots, to follow Chairman Mao's words, to carry on the revolution, and to build socialism for life.

This is how Wang Sheng, with a heart red for the sun, followed Chairman Mao step by step.

    “穷棒子社”贫下中农心向毛主席
    著名的“穷棒子社”——河北省遵化县建明人民公社西铺大队，经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，伟大的毛泽东思想更加普及，更加深入人心。下面刊登的就是他们活学活用毛泽东思想的几个小故事。
    一颗红心向着红太阳
    “穷棒子”的心永远向着红太阳。
    “穷棒子社”的王生老大爷，旧社会在地主阶级残酷的剥削压迫下，被迫要了二十四年饭，熬坏了双眼。是伟大领袖毛主席把他和千百万个“穷棒子”从水深火热中解放出来，并率领他们走上了社会主义的康庄大道。王生老大爷经常对人说：“俺不会说不会道，可咱认准了一条真理：伟大领袖毛主席是咱穷人的大救星，‘穷棒子’要想不受穷，就得永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席干社会主义！”
    文化大革命中，他为了紧跟毛主席，刻苦地活学活用毛泽东思想。书本上的字小，看不清，他就请革命小将用毛笔把“老三篇”和毛主席语录抄在本子上。每天晚上，王生老大爷就把抄写的本子捧到灯下，一个字一个字地看，一个字一个字地记。就这样，两年来王大爷学完了“老三篇”，还学习了毛主席一系列最新指示。
    王大爷越学对毛主席越亲。他牢记毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导，积极参加文化大革命。大队召开批判会、学习会，不论是在白天还是晚上，每一次他都要参加。有人劝他说：“王生大爷呀！象你这么大年纪，眼睛不好使，腿脚又不灵便，就呆在家里吧，村里的事还用得着你操心？”老人坚定地说：“坐享清福？不成！社会主义不是从天上掉下来的，全靠咱发扬‘穷棒子精神’，跟着毛主席闹革命，国家和集体的事咱不操心，那些没有改造好的地富反坏右就要变天哩！”他没有听别人的劝说，更加积极地参加文化大革命运动。
    当毛主席发出“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示后，大队推选他作为贫下中农代表参加建明农业中学的管理工作，老人激动得半夜没有睡觉。他说：“毛主席对咱‘穷棒子’最信任，咱一定要为毛主席他老人家争气！”他在学校里，给学生们讲自己的苦难家史，教育青年人不要忘本，要听毛主席的话，接好革命的班，干一辈子社会主义。
    王生老大爷就是这样，一颗红心向太阳，步步紧跟毛主席。
