The Brand of "State Farms": Capitalist Goods
From a So-Called "Advanced" Example of the Soviet Revisionists' "New Economic System," We See the Essence of Their Exploitation

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, the Soviet Union's _Agricultural Economics_ magazine recently reported on the "achievements" and "experiences" of the "Krasnodar State Pig Farming Trust" in implementing the so-called "new economic system." By dissecting the situation of this so-called "advanced" "state" agricultural enterprise under the "new system," one can clearly see: the socialist state farms of the former Soviet Union have today been transformed by the Soviet revisionist clique into thorough capitalist enterprises; the so-called "new economic system" vigorously promoted by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like is an important means for them to further restore capitalism and strengthen the oppression and exploitation of the Soviet working people.

	According to the report by the Soviet revisionist magazine, the Krasnodar "State Pig Farming Trust" includes a total of 26 pig farms and grain farms. They respectively implemented the "new system" on July 1, 1967, and April 1 of this year, transitioning to "full economic accounting," and using the extraction of large amounts of "profits" from the working people as the main indicator to measure operating conditions.

	The nine farms that began implementing this system last July extracted "profits" last year, averaging about 50% more than other farms. Among them, the "Spark" pig farm had a "profit rate" of 57% in pig farming, and the Kusev farm had a "profit rate" of over 68%. This means that these two farms used 100 rubles of capital to extract over 50 to 60 rubles of "profits" for the Soviet bourgeois privileged class in one year.

	The Soviet revisionist clique leaders, Brezhnev and Kosygin, have repeatedly publicly proclaimed that profit is the standard for evaluating an enterprise's "contribution." After implementing the "new system," profit became the fundamental driving force for all production and operational activities of the Krasnodar "State Pig Farming Trust." They engaged in capitalist free enterprise, from production and basic construction plans to personnel allocations, all decided by the farm leaders based on the "profit principle." Moreover, like the bosses of capitalist enterprises in all countries, they have the right to hire and arbitrarily dismiss workers. In short, they do whatever can earn more money.

	According to _Agricultural Economics_ magazine, to pursue high profits, this small group of the bourgeois privileged class, while dismissing a large number of permanent workers from each farm, hired a much smaller number of "seasonal and temporary workers" to replace the work of the dismissed permanent workers. They strengthened the so-called farm leaders and experts' "constant supervision" over the workers, implementing a "piecework wage system," and so on.

	The magazine admitted that the "Spark" pig farm dismissed 147 permanent workers in 1967, but hired 78 "seasonal and temporary workers" who could not receive "welfare" benefits and various "bonuses." The Soviet privileged elements did this to reduce wage expenses on one hand and increase their exploitation income; on the other hand, they used the threat of unemployment to force the employed workers to work hard for them. The evil intentions and vicious methods of the Soviet privileged elements are exactly the same as those of the capitalist bloodsuckers!

	The Soviet revisionist clique, in their "new system," uses so-called "material incentives" and "material encouragement" as bait to deceive workers into working hard for them. They deceive Soviet industrial and agricultural workers, claiming that enterprises can extract a certain proportion of so-called "material incentive funds" from the profits earned, using it to pay various "bonuses" to employees; that is, the more profits an enterprise earns, the better it seems for the employees. However, numerous facts show that their so-called "material encouragement" and "material incentives" are merely means to intensify the exploitation of surplus value and strengthen the control, restriction, and oppression of the working people. The various "bonuses" used by enterprises for "material incentives" actually fall largely into the pockets of a small group of bourgeois privileged elements and enterprise leaders. The "new system" has made them even fatter.

	According to the regulations of the "new system," the Krasnodar "State Pig Farming Trust" set up various kinds of "bonuses" in its subordinate farms, claiming that whoever works well can receive this "material encouragement." However, various "bonuses," such as the so-called "departmental competition bonus" and "bonus for completing tasks on time and to quality," are "under the control of the sub-farm managers, mechanical repair shop and garage directors, and construction team leaders," and the "incentive standards" are also formulated by these "leaders" and the trade union committees that have become tools of the privileged class. Ordinary workers have no say in the matter. Moreover, they have stipulated many methods to withhold "bonuses," making the number of workers who can actually receive "bonuses" extremely small, while using "bonuses" to strengthen the control, restriction, and oppression of workers. According to their regulations, enterprise privileged elements can use various reasons to "reduce or not issue bonuses" to workers, such as "violating labor discipline," "work errors," "poor attitude," "minor accidents," "defective products," "late arrival," "absenteeism," "poor technical attitude," and so on. They also stipulated that those who "worked less than a year" do not receive bonuses, and those "dismissed by the state farm before the end of the year" do not receive bonuses. After implementing the "new system," some high-salaried privileged elements can use their various privileges to make various new regulations to earn money, and under the name of "bonuses," seize more income. For example, they stipulated in the reward regulations that the so-called "annual overall performance bonus" should be "calculated based on the amount of an employee's annual salary." The salaries of farm privileged elements are originally tens of times higher than those of workers, so they can naturally receive tens of times more "bonuses" than ordinary workers. In addition, the Soviet revisionist clique specially set up an item called "profit acquisition bonus" for farm "leaders and experts." According to reports, in the first batch of nine farms that implemented the "new system" in this trust, in 1967 alone, this so-called "profit acquisition bonus" made these farm privileged elements earn an additional 207,000 rubles.

	The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. With power, one has everything; without power, one loses everything. The fact that the working people in this Soviet revisionist trust suffer twice over once again illustrates this great truth.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The counter-revolutionary business of the imperialist government, although done every day, is always full of righteousness and morality on the mouth, or at least somewhat righteous and moral, and never tells the truth in official documents." The Soviet revisionist clique is the same. On one hand, they fully restore capitalism and cruelly oppress and exploit the vast majority of Soviet working people; on the other hand, they shamelessly loudly proclaim the construction of communism, claiming that their "new economic system" is "socialist in essence." However, their own proclaimed "advanced" example, the Krasnodar "State Pig Farming Trust," has completely stripped off their fig leaves.

    “国营农场”的商标　资本主义的货色
    从苏修的一个所谓“先进”典型看苏修“新经济体制”的剥削本质
    据新华社十三日讯　本社记者报道，苏联《农业经济》杂志，不久以前作为“先进”典型报道了俄罗斯联邦克拉斯诺达“国营养猪场托拉斯”实行所谓“新经济体制”的“成绩”和“经验”。解剖一下苏修叛徒集团大肆宣扬的这个所谓“先进”“国营”农业企业推行“新体制”的情况，人们就不难再一次清楚地看出：当年苏联的社会主义的国营农场今天已被苏修叛徒集团蜕变成地地道道的资本主义企业；勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流大力推行的所谓“新经济体制”，就是他们进一步复辟资本主义、加强对苏联劳动人民的压迫和剥削的重要手段。剥削工人榨取利润
    据苏修这家杂志报道，克拉斯诺达“国营养猪场托拉斯”共包括二十六个养猪场和谷物种植场。它们分别在一九六七年七月一日和今年四月一日实行了
  “新体制”，转入了“完全经济核算制”，把从劳动人民身上榨取大量“利润”作为衡量经营情况的主要指标。
    去年七月开始实行这种体制的九个场，一九六七年榨取的“利润”，平均比其他场要多百分之五十左右。其中，“火花”养猪场在养猪方面的“赢利率”高达百分之五十七，库谢夫农场“赢利率”高达百分之六十八以上。这就是说，这两个场用一百卢布的资本在一年之内为苏联资产阶级特权集团榨取了五、六十卢布以上的“利润”。
    苏修叛徒集团头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流一再公开宣扬，利润是评价企业“贡献”的标准。在实行
  “新体制”以后，利润成了克拉斯诺达“国营养猪场托拉斯”一切生产、经营活动的根本动力。它们大搞资本主义自由经营，从生产、基本建设计划到人员编制，都由各农场的领导人根据“利润原则”自行决定。而且，同一切资本主义国家企业的老板一样，他们有权招收和任意开除工人。总之，怎样干能赚更多的钱，他们就怎样干。
    据《农业经济》杂志透露，为了追求高额利润，这一小撮资产阶级特权阶层在大量开除各农场固定职工的同时，雇佣人数少得多的“季节工人和临时工人”来代替被开除的固定工人的工作。他们大力加强对劳动人民实行资产阶级专政的所谓农场领导人和专家对工人的“经常监督”，搞什么“包件工资制度”等等。
    这家杂志承认，“火花”养猪场一九六七年开除了一百四十七名固定工人，同时却雇佣了七十八名不能获得“福利”待遇和各种“奖金”的“季节工人和临时工人”。苏修特权分子这样做，一方面可以缩减工资开支，增加他们的剥削收入；另一方面，又可以用失业的威胁来迫使在业工人为他们拚命劳动。苏修特权分子用心之险恶，手段之毒辣，同资本主义国家的资本家吸血鬼们真是一模一样！特权阶层大捞“奖金”
    苏修叛徒集团在他们的“新体制”中，以所谓“物质刺激”、“物质鼓励”为诱饵，诱骗工人为他们卖命。他们欺骗苏联工农业劳动者，说什么企业可以从赚取的利润中提取一定比例的所谓“物质刺激基金”，用它来支付对职工的各种“奖金”；也就是说，企业赚取的利润越多，对职工似乎也越有好处。然而，大量事实说明，他们的所谓“物质鼓励”、“物质刺激”，只不过是加紧压榨剩余价值和加强对劳动人民管、卡、压的一种手段。企业用来进行“物质刺激”的各种“奖金”，实际上有很大一部分落入一小撮资产阶级特权阶层和企业领导人的腰包。“新体制”把他们养得更肥了。
    按照“新体制”的规定，克拉斯诺达“国营养猪场托拉斯”所属各农场设立了名目繁多的各种各样
  “奖金”，说什么谁“劳动好”，谁就可以得到这种
  “物质鼓励”。可是各种“奖金”，例如，所谓的
  “部门内部竞赛奖”、“按时按质完成任务奖”等等，都是“交由分场场长、机械修配厂和车库主任、建筑工段长支配”的，“奖励指标”也是由他们这些“领导人”和已成为特权阶层御用工具的“工会委员会”制订。普通工人是无权过问的。此外，他们还规定了许多克扣“奖金”的办法，使得“奖金”能够真正发给工人的为数极少，另一方面利用“奖金”来加强对工人的管、卡、压。按他们的规定，企业特权分子可借以“削减或根本不发奖金”给工人的“理由”有：“破坏劳动纪律”、“工作有差错”、“工作态度不好”、“出小事故”、“出废品”、“迟到”、
  “旷工”、“对技术态度不好”等等。他们还规定什么“工作不满一年的”不发，“年终以前被国营农场解雇的”不发。在实行“新体制”后，一些拿着高薪的特权分子们，可以利用自己的种种特权，作出各种各样可以为自己捞钱的新规定，在“奖金”名义下，攫取更多的收入。例如，他们在奖励条例中规定，所谓“全年工作总成绩奖”，要“按工作人员一年所获工资（的数额）来计算”。农场特权分子的工资本来就比工人高十几倍以至几十倍，这样一来，当然可以拿到比普通工人多好多倍的“奖金”。此外，苏修叛徒集团还专门为农场的“领导工作人员和专家”设立了一项所谓“获取利润奖”。据报道，在这个托拉斯第一批实行“新体制”的九个农场中，一九六七年仅仅这一项所谓“获取利润奖”，就使这些农场的特权分子多收入了二十万七千卢布。失去政权丧失一切
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有了一切，没有政权就丧失一切。苏修这个托拉斯中的劳动人民受二遍苦的事实，再次说明了这一伟大的真理。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。”苏修叛徒集团也是如此。他们一方面全面复辟资本主义，残酷压迫和剥削苏联广大劳动人民，一方面却厚着脸皮大肆喧嚷什么“全面建设共产主义”，说什么他们的“新经济体制”“从实质上说是社会主义的”。然而他们自己宣扬的“先进”典型克拉斯诺达“国营养猪场托拉斯”，却正好把他们的这些遮羞布剥了个精光。
