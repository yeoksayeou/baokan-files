Title: Paved the Way for a Broad Road of Educational Revolution

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up a broad road for the realization of the proletarian educational revolution. The revolutionary teachers and students of our school, under the leadership of the working class, have followed the great teachings of Chairman Mao, "learn from the workers, learn from the peasants, learn from the soldiers," and have carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution. They have stepped out of the school gates and thrown themselves into the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

Based on our personal experience, we believe that urban middle schools should be run as follows:

1. Led by the working class, with poor and lower-middle peasants participating in management. In the past, urban middle schools, under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, kept students confined within the four walls of the school, neither going to factories nor to the countryside. Workers angrily said, "Our children go to school, but we have no say in school affairs. This is all the doing of Liu Shaoqi!" Poor and lower-middle peasants also angrily said, "Urban students must step out of the city gates. Schools must serve us poor and lower-middle peasants." Therefore, urban middle schools, in addition to being run by factories, must also face the broad masses of peasants and go to the countryside. Based on the experience of students learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers over the past year, we have established a revolutionary committee with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body. Poor and lower-middle peasants are mainly responsible for managing the agricultural school. In this way, the school is incorporated into the production front of industry and agriculture, making teachers and students truly live among workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Factories running schools is the direction for the development of urban middle schools. However, while the factory revolutionary committees lead the schools, poor and lower-middle peasants should also participate in management when possible.

2. Learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and take the road of integrating with workers and peasants. Since March of this year, our school has successively established learning-from-workers and learning-from-peasants bases in the Beijing Third Rolling Mill and the Hongjun Camp Brigade. The agricultural learning base, taking the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, has reclaimed over a hundred acres of wasteland, started a small farm on its own, and jointly established a small factory within the school with the Beijing Middle School in Hebei. Teachers and students go to factories and rural areas in batches to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Schools that cannot establish learning-from-workers and learning-from-peasants bases can link up with factories and rural areas and establish a system for participating in production labor.

3. Build a revolutionary teaching staff. To "spit out the old and take in the new," we must purge a handful of traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist-roaders, and all kinds of ghosts and monsters who have infiltrated the teaching staff. At the same time, we must recruit a group of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants with high proletarian political awareness and practical experience to strengthen the teaching staff.

Existing teachers should go to factories and rural areas with students to labor and receive re-education from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. They should be both teachers and students, both teachers and workers or peasants, never detaching themselves from the production struggle, and it is convenient to link theory with practice.

Currently, the teaching staff of the school is mainly composed of the following: workers stationed at the school, the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, workers with proletarian political awareness and practical experience, poor and lower-middle peasants, technicians (mostly part-time), and revolutionary intellectuals from the original teaching staff (full-time, mainly responsible for organizing teaching).

4. Emphasize proletarian politics and implement political leadership in education. Learning from the People's Liberation Army, we have established a political work system and institutions: the school has a political department, and teachers and students are organized into units like army platoons. We have abolished the teaching and research groups, and each platoon has a political instructor. We have vigorously carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and regularly held meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We have insisted on the Four Firsts, carried forward the spirit of the May 4th Movement, and launched the Four Good Platoons and Five Good Soldiers movements. We have carried out bitter-sweet education to raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines. We have widely carried out the "one helps one, one red pair" and mass thought-political work. The entire school has presented a lively and vigorous new situation of "unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness."

5. Regarding enrollment, school system, curriculum, examinations, and graduation issues. Following Chairman Mao's instructions on "thoroughly reforming textbooks, simplifying some first," we have set up five courses: politics, language, industrial production knowledge, agricultural production knowledge (mathematics, physics, and chemistry are integrated and studied in connection with industrial and agricultural production struggles), and foreign language (not as a key course). We have broken away from the past phenomenon of complicated and overlapping courses that are detached from proletarian politics and reality. Textbooks should be compiled together with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Teaching should focus on on-site teaching, with workers, peasants, industrial and agricultural technicians, teachers, and students working together to prepare and teach lessons.

The school system should be changed from a six-year system to a four-year continuous system. We have abolished the past examination system. Students should go to the three great revolutionary movements, and workers, peasants, and soldiers should make evaluations.

Enrollment should be carried out according to the national plan and nearby; graduates should be allocated by the state, facing the countryside, the border, the grassroots, and the mines.

    开辟了教育革命的广阔道路
    无产阶级文化大革命，为实现无产阶级教育革命开辟了广阔的道路。我校广大革命师生，在工人阶级的领导下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“学工、学农、学军”的教导，发扬彻底革命的精神，走出校门，投身到了阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中。
    我们根据切身的体会，认为城市中学应该这样办：
    一，由工人阶级领导，有贫下中农参加管理。过去城市中学在反革命修正主义教育路线的统治下，把学生死死关在四合院里，一不到工厂，二不到农村。工人气愤地说：“我们的孩子在学校上学，学校的事我们却管不了，这都是刘少奇搞的鬼！”贫下中农也气愤地说：“城市的学生一定要走出城门，学校要为咱贫下中农服务。”因此，城市中学除了要由工厂来办外，一定还要面向广大农民，到农村去。根据一年来学生学工、学农、学军的实践经验，我们成立了以工农兵为主体的革命委员会。贫下中农主要负责管理学农分校。这样，把学校纳入了工农业生产战线，使师生真正生活在工农兵之中。
    工厂办学校，这是城市中学发展的方向。但在工厂革委会对学校实行领导的同时，在可能情况下，也要有贫下中农参加管理。
    二，学工、学农、学军，走与工农相结合的道路。我校从今年三月起，相继在北京第三轧钢厂和红军营大队，建立了学工、学农基地。学农基地以“抗大”为榜样，开垦了一百多亩荒地，自力更生办起了小农场，并且同河北北京中学合办了校内小工厂。师生分批分期到工厂、农村参加工农业生产劳动，接受工农兵的再教育。
    不能建立学工、学农基地的学校，可以和工厂、农村挂钩，订立参加生产劳动的制度。
    三，建立一支革命化的教师队伍。要“吐故纳新”，清除混进教师队伍中的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和一切牛鬼蛇神。同时，吸收一批有高度无产阶级政治觉悟、有实践经验的工人、贫下中农充实教师队伍。
    现有教师要随学生到工厂、农村劳动，接受工人和贫下中农的再教育，既当先生又当学生，既当教师又当工人、农民，永远不脱离生产斗争，又便于理论联系实际。
    现在学校的教师队伍基本上来自以下几个方面：驻校工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，有无产阶级政治觉悟的、有实践经验的工人、贫下中农、技术员（以上主要是兼职）和原来教师队伍中的革命知识分子（专职，主要负责组织教学）。
    四，突出无产阶级政治，实行政治建校。学习解放军，建立了政治工作体制和制度：校设政治处，师生按部队连队进行编制，取消教研组，连设指导员；大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，定期召开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会；坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展四好连队、五好战士运动；开展忆苦思甜教育，提高两条路线斗争觉悟；广泛开展“一帮一、一对红”和群众性的思想政治工作。全校出现了“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”的生气勃勃的新局面。
    五，关于招生、学制、课程、考试和毕业问题。遵照毛主席关于“教材要彻底改革，有的首先删繁就简”的教导，设置政治、语文、工业生产知识、农业生产知识（数、理、化打通，结合工农业生产斗争学习）、外语（不作重点课）等五门课。打破过去课程设置烦琐重叠、脱离无产阶级政治、脱离实际的现象。教材要和工农兵一起编写。教学要着重现场教学，由工农兵、工农业技术员、教师、学生四结合备课、教课。
    学制要把六年制改为四年一贯制。取消过去的考试制度。学生到三大革命运动中去，由工农兵作鉴定。
    按国家计划统一就近招生；毕业生由国家统一分配，面向农村，面向边疆，面向基层，面向工矿。
