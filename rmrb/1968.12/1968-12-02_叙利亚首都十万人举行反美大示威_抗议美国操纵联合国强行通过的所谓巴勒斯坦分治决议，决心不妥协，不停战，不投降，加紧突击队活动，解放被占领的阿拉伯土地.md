Hundreds of thousands of workers, peasants, students, women, and soldiers in the Syrian capital of Damascus held a demonstration on the 30th to protest against the United Nations' so-called partition resolution for Palestine, and to express their determination to liberate Arab lands occupied by Israel.

Twenty-one years ago, on November 29, 1947, the new and old colonialists, led by the United States, manipulated the United Nations to forcibly pass the so-called partition resolution for Palestine.

The head of state of Syria, Atassi, government ministers, and members of the Palestinian commando units participated in this protest demonstration.

The demonstrators condemned U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, and denounced the conspiracy of a "political solution" to the Middle East problem. They shouted, "Johnson, listen, listen, the Arab people will never be betrayed!" "Eshkol, look, look, the Palestinian commandos will surely give you a good beating!" They held banners with slogans such as, "Armed struggle is the only path to our victory!" "No compromise, no ceasefire, no surrender, intensify commando activities in the occupied areas!"

After the demonstration, a mass rally was held. Atassi addressed the rally, saying:

"We must remember: the foundation of this Zionist base is supported by international imperialism, strengthened by U.S. military and financial aid. We must understand that the appropriate response to this support is an uncompromising struggle against imperialism and colonialism."

Atassi said, the Zionists should not think that with the support of imperialism, with the money and weapons from the United States, Britain, and West Germany, including the U.S.-provided "Phantom" aircraft and other long-range combat aircraft, they can conquer the Arab people. "They should know that the Arab people have already started a revolution in the heart of the occupied areas, at the Lod Airport, in Jerusalem. The Arab resistance is a natural, just, and effective response to Zionist occupation, it defends the dignity of the Arab people, and it is a war of liberation."

Atassi said that the Arabs are fighting to defend the existence of the Arab people and against the aggression of imperialism and Zionism. "This battle is a long-term one, and we must mobilize our potential to support this battle."

Atassi finally expressed that the entire military and civilian population of Syria will spare no sacrifice to achieve the goal of Arab national liberation. In the past three days, residents of various cities in Syria have held similar demonstrations to express their determination to liberate the occupied Arab territories.

    叙利亚首都十万人举行反美大示威
    抗议美国操纵联合国强行通过的所谓巴勒斯坦分治决议，决心不妥协，不停战，不投降，加紧突击队活动，解放被占领的阿拉伯土地
    新华社大马士革三十日电　叙利亚工人、农民、学生、妇女和军人等十万人三十日在首都大马士革举行示威，抗议联合国所谓巴勒斯坦分治的决议，并表示他们决心解放被以色列占领的阿拉伯土地。
    二十一年前，一九四七年十一月二十九日，以美国为首的新老殖民主义者操纵联合国强行通过所谓巴勒斯坦分治决议。
    叙利亚国家元首阿塔西、政府部长和巴勒斯坦突击队成员等参加了这次抗议示威。
    示威群众谴责美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列，谴责所谓“政治解决”中东问题的阴谋。他们高呼：“约翰逊，你听着，听着，阿拉伯人民决不会被出卖！”“艾希科尔，你瞧着，瞧着，巴勒斯坦突击队员一定要狠狠地揍你！”他们举着横幅标语，上面写着：“武装斗争是我们取得胜利的唯一道路！”“不妥协，不停战，不投降，加紧被占领区内的突击队活动！”
    示威结束后，举行了群众大会。阿塔西在大会上发表讲话说：
  “我们必须牢记：这个犹太复国主义基地的基础是得到国际帝国主义支持的，是由美国的军事和财政支援所加强的。我们必须懂得，对这种支持的当然回答是同帝国主义和殖民主义作毫不留情的斗争。”
    阿塔西说：犹太复国主义者不要以为，他们有帝国主义的支持，有美国、英国和西德的金钱和武器支援，包括美国提供
  “鬼怪式”飞机和其他长距离战斗机，他们就能征服阿拉伯人民。“他们要知道，我们阿拉伯人民已经在被占领区的心脏，在利达机场，在耶路撒冷闹革命了。阿拉伯人的反抗是对犹太复国主义的占领的自然、正当和有效的答复，它维护了阿拉伯人的尊严，是一场人民解放战争。”
    阿塔西说，阿拉伯人正在为了捍卫阿拉伯人的生存和反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的侵略而战斗，“这场战斗是长期的，必须调动我们的潜力来支援这场战斗”。
    阿塔西最后表示叙利亚全体军民将不惜一切牺牲来实现阿拉伯民族解放的目的。在过去三天中，叙利亚各城市居民举行了类似的示威，以表示他们要解放被占领的阿拉伯领土的决心。
