We will definitely educate the sent-down youth well. This is the collective voice of all the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yingju Brigade, Yingju People's Commune, Fengqiu County, Henan Province.

The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "It is necessary to send knowledge youth to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade cadres and other people in the cities to send their children, who have finished junior middle school, senior middle school, or college, to the countryside. Each locality should mobilize them to go. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." This completely expresses the feelings of us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is another battle cry for achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great and wise measure to prevent and guard against revisionism, narrow the gap between urban and rural areas, and accelerate socialist construction. We poor and lower-middle peasants support it a thousand times and will carry it out ten thousand times.

Our Yingju Brigade is the very brigade that Chairman Mao recommended to the whole nation in his brilliant work "Introducing a Cooperative" written ten years ago. In early October this year, when we poor and lower-middle peasants heard the news that 47 knowledge youth and one household, totaling 50 people, from Xinxiang City, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the countryside is a vast world where one can do great things," were coming to settle down in our brigade, we were so happy that we couldn't sleep the whole night. For this matter, we specially convened a brigade meeting to discuss how to welcome the new members.

We follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao on "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other," and first of all, we cleaned the 18 tile-roofed houses that we had vacated spotlessly. We poor and lower-middle peasants also vacated 24 beds and made 26 new ones, so that everyone has a bed. We also prepared firewood, rice, oil, and salt.

When the knowledge youth and their parents arrived by car, the whole village, young and old, men and women, came out to welcome them, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding red flags, holding precious books, and beating drums and gongs. At the welcoming meeting, we together wished Chairman Mao a long life! We sang "The East Is Red" and studied the highest instructions. Then, we presented them with three treasures: First is the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the "Three Articles," and "Introducing a Cooperative." We require them to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts with us, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, and become good members who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Second is the labor tools. We require them to take Dazhai people as examples, strive hard, be self-reliant, and write the newest and most beautiful words and draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on the land of Yingju. Third is the sewing kit. We require them to take the PLA as an example and inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of hard work and plain living of the old Red Army and the Eighth Route Army. At the same time, we also told them the history of our families, the history of the village, and the history of the struggle between the two lines, so that they understand how we poor and lower-middle peasants have fought against nature, against the land, and against class enemies, and advanced along the socialist course indicated by Chairman Mao, writing a brilliant chapter.

We poor and lower-middle peasants also took them to our homes as guests, serving them two kinds of meals: one is the bitter meal of the past; the other is the happy meal of liberation, remembering Chairman Mao. The knowledge youth and residents who came to settle down repeatedly expressed that they would take root in Yingju Brigade forever and build a new socialist countryside with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The parents who came to send their children held our hands and said, "We entrust our children to you, and we are at ease." We said, "We will definitely follow the words of the great leader Chairman Mao and educate the children well."

As we spoke, everyone couldn't hold back their excitement, and together we sang, "The greatest is the party's kindness, father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao..." We sang over and over again, wishing Chairman Mao a long life! A long life!

    俺们一定把下乡知识青年教育好
    河南省封丘县应举公社应举大队全体贫下中农
    伟大领袖毛主席最新指示：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”完全说出了俺们贫下中农的心里话。这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的又一个战斗号令，是防修反修、缩小城乡差别、加速社会主义建设的重大英明措施。俺们贫下中农一千个拥护，一万个照办。
    我们应举大队，就是毛主席在十年前写的光辉著作《介绍一个合作社》里向全国人民推荐过的那个应举社。今年十月初，当俺们贫下中农听说新乡市四十七名知识青年和一户居民共五十人，遵照毛主席“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”伟大教导，要到俺们大队安家落户的消息后，高兴得一夜没合上眼。为这事，俺们专门召开了大队社员会议，讨论了如何迎接新社员的到来。
    我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的伟大教导，首先把腾出的十八间瓦房打扫得一干二净。俺们贫下中农还腾出了二十四张床，又新做了二十六张床，使每一个人都有一张床。柴米油盐也都准备齐了。
    知识青年和他们的家长乘车来的时候，全村男女老少齐出动，抬着毛主席像，扛着红旗，手捧宝书，敲锣打鼓地欢迎。在欢迎大会上，俺们共同祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！高唱《东方红》，学习最高指示。接着，俺们赠给他们三样宝：第一是《毛主席语录》、“老三篇”和《介绍一个合作社》。要求他们和俺们一起活学活用毛泽东思想，破私立公，做一个永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的好社员。第二是劳动工具。要求他们和俺们共同以大寨人为榜样，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，在应举大地上写出最新最美的文字，画出最新最美的画图。第三是针线包。要求他们和俺们一样以解放军为榜样，继承和发扬老红军、老八路艰苦朴素的优良传统。同时，俺们还给他们讲了家史、村史和两条路线斗争史，使他们了解俺们贫下中农与天斗、与地斗、与阶级敌人斗，沿着毛主席所指引的社会主义航向前进所写出的光辉篇章。
    俺们贫下中农还拉着他们到家里做客，吃两种饭：一种是忆苦饭；一种是翻身不忘毛主席的幸福饭。安家落户的知识青年和居民们再三表示，永远在应举大队扎根，和贫下中农共同建设社会主义新农村。来送孩子的家长们拉着俺们贫下中农的手说：“我们把孩子交给你们，放心了。”俺们说：“我们一定听伟大领袖毛主席的话，把孩子们教育好。”
    说着说着，大家抑制不住激动的心情，共同高唱：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，……”一遍又一遍地祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
