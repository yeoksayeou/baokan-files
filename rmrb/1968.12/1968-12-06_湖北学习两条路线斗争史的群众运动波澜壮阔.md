The mass movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines in Hubei Province is magnificent. The entire province has held tens of thousands of study classes. Revolutionary masses closely link the actual struggle between the two lines in their region and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units. They fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, making the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines deeper and deeper, greatly raising the revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 5th: The 32 million revolutionary people of Hubei Province, in fully implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, follow the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly spoken about. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." They have launched a magnificent mass movement to seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines.

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction was issued, members of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee immediately went deep into factories, offices, schools, and neighborhoods. They studied the history of the struggle between the two lines with the broad revolutionary masses, angrily criticized Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and enthusiastically sang the praises of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Revolutionary committees at the county level across the province mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to hold tens of thousands of study classes. In the vast lake area, countless boats spreading Mao Zedong Thought braved the waves day and night, delivering Chairman Mao's latest instructions to fishing villages. In the mountainous areas of northwestern Hubei, Gu Cheng County organized more than 500 propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, going deep into every part of the county. They staged the history of the struggle between the two lines and the class struggle in the region, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In Lin Biao's hometown, Huanggang County, the Red Guards Commune, Red Guards Brigade, and Lin Family Village's poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, held a grand meeting to denounce the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They decided to take Lin Biao as a shining example, to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and to forever defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in urban and rural areas of Hubei, in the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, closely link the facts of the struggle between the two lines in their region, continuously raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, making the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines deeper and deeper. At every important juncture in the Chinese revolution, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi had repeatedly come to Hubei to push his bourgeois reactionary line. In 1927, Liu Shaoqi betrayed the then-thriving workers' revolutionary movement in Wuhan; in 1956, he again came to Wuhan, colluding with capitalists to resist socialist transformation, attempting to restore capitalism; in 1964, during the high tide of the socialist education movement, he came to Hubei to push his infamous "left" in form but right in essence bourgeois reactionary line. The broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, with their own personal experiences, thoroughly exposed and criticized Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line; with their own struggle practices, enthusiastically sang the praises of Chairman Mao's great victories in the proletarian revolutionary line. Workers who participated in the workers' revolutionary movement in Hubei in 1927, members of the workers' patrol teams, members of the labor children's teams, members of the propaganda teams, and old workers, held various meetings day after day, speaking from personal experience, thoroughly exposing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the workers' movement in 1927, disbanding the workers' patrol teams, and handing over all weapons to the Kuomintang reactionaries, making the Wuhan working class face the counter-revolutionary massacre with bare hands and suffer a massacre. They said, such historical lessons, we must constantly speak about, repeatedly speak about, so that the broad revolutionary masses know, raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines high, let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line take deep root in our minds, and criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line thoroughly.

The broad revolutionary people in urban and rural areas of Hubei, closely linking the actual struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, use the real class struggle in their units as a living textbook, study the history of the struggle between the two lines, greatly raising the broad revolutionary people's awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, making the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement go deeper and deeper along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Members of the revolutionary committees in various places in urban and rural areas of Hubei, in the process of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, with the great leader Chairman Mao's great instruction: "To achieve national victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li," "We must always maintain a humble, prudent, and modest attitude, and we must always maintain a spirit of hard work and self-reliance," as a mirror, recognize that the arrogance and complacency that has begun to grow in some members of the revolutionary committees, the phenomenon of wanting to hear more praise and less criticism, is a manifestation of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets attacking themselves. They use Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee as a weapon, carry out criticism and self-criticism, fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, and are determined to adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, put the revolutionary committee under the supervision of the broad revolutionary masses, and build the revolutionary committee into a battle command center leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch an attack on the class enemy.

    湖北学习两条路线斗争史的群众运动波澜壮阔
    全省举办了数以万计的学习班，广大革命群众紧密联系本地区两条路线斗争的实际和本单位的斗、批、改，狠批刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，使两条路线斗争史的学习运动步步深入，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟
    据新华社武汉五日电　湖北省三千二百万革命人民，在全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报中，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新教导，掀起了波澜壮阔的认真学习两条路线斗争史的群众运动。
    毛主席的最新指示发表后，湖北省革命委员会和武汉市各级革命委员会的成员，立即深入各工厂、机关、学校、街道，和广大革命群众一起，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，愤怒批判刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，热情歌颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。全省各县革命委员会发动广大贫下中农举办了数以万计的学习班。在广大湖区，无数毛泽东思想宣传船乘风破浪，夜以继日地将毛主席的最新指示送到渔村。鄂西北大山区的谷城县，组织了五百多个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入全县各地，把本地区两条路线斗争的历史和阶级斗争的活材料搬上舞台，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，热情赞颂毛主席的革命路线。林副主席的家乡黄冈县红卫公社红卫大队林家大塆的贫下中农和革命干部，在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，召开了声势浩大的声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的大会。他们决心以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
    湖北城乡广大工农兵群众在学习两条路线斗争史的运动中，紧密联系本地区两条路线斗争的事实，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，使两条路线斗争史的学习运动步步深入。在中国革命发展的每个重要关头，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇曾多次窜到湖北来推行他的资产阶级反动路线。一九二七年，刘少奇在武汉出卖了当时蓬勃兴起的湖北工人革命运动；一九五六年，刘少奇又窜到武汉，勾结资本家抗拒社会主义改造，妄图复辟资本主义；一九六四年，在社会主义教育运动高潮中，他又来到湖北推行他臭名昭著的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线。广大工人和贫下中农，以自己的亲身经历，彻底揭露和批判刘少奇推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行；以自己的斗争实践，热情歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。一九二七年参加过湖北工人革命运动的工人纠察队员、劳动童子团员、宣传队员、老工人，连日来举行各种集会，现身说法，彻底揭露刘少奇一九二七年出卖工人运动，解散工人纠察队，把全部枪支拱手交给国民党反动派，使武汉工人阶级在反革命屠杀面前赤手空拳惨遭屠杀的滔天罪行。他们说，这样的历史教训，我们一定要经常讲，反复讲，使广大革命群众都知道，把我们的两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，让毛主席的革命路线在我们头脑里扎根扎得深深的，把刘少奇的反动路线批得臭臭的。
    湖北城乡广大革命人民，紧密结合本单位斗、批、改的实际，以本单位阶级斗争的现实为活教材，学习两条路线斗争的历史，大大提高了广大革命人民执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性，使斗、批、改运动沿着毛主席的革命路线步步深入。
    湖北城乡各地革委会成员在学习两条路线斗争史的过程中，以伟大领袖毛主席“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”，“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的伟大教导为镜子，认识到在部分革委会成员中开始滋长的骄傲自满情绪，愿意多听好话，不愿多听批评的现象，就是资产阶级用糖衣炮弹向自己进攻的表现。他们以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为武器，开展批评与自我批评，狠批刘少奇在政权建设上的反革命修正主义路线，决心坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把革委会置于广大革命群众的监督之下，把革命委员会建设成为率领广大革命群众向阶级敌人发动进攻的战斗指挥部。
