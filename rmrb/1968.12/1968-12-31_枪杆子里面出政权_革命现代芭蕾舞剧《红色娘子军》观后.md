Guns Produce Power
– Observations on the Revolutionary Modern Ballet "Red Detachment of Women"

Yun Dalan, Squad Leader of the Red Detachment of Women Militia, Qionghai County, Hainan Island

The revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women" depicts the struggle of the people of Hainan during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, where a revolutionary women's armed force—the Red Detachment of Women—bravely fought against landlords, tyrants, and the reactionary Kuomintang. It vividly recreates the grand scene of the people's war led by the great leader Chairman Mao, highlighting the brilliant thought of Chairman Mao: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." As the curtain of the ballet "Red Detachment of Women" rises, it immediately presents a fierce class struggle. Nan Batian, to maintain his evil reactionary regime, uses dungeons, shackles, and whips to carry out the most brutal and barbaric suppression of those who resist. The tragic fate of the protagonist Wu Qinghua is but a microcosm of the countless class sisters and laboring people who suffered persecution. However, where there is oppression, there is resistance; the deeper the oppression, the stronger the resistance. Wu Qinghua, this "maid" with deep bitterness and hatred, not only did not yield in the face of Nan Batian's dark dungeon and blood-stained whip, but she rose up in rebellion. Finally, she burst out of the hell on earth with a body full of whip marks and a heart full of hatred. Wu Qinghua's fearless fighting spirit and revolutionary spirit are also a true reflection of the tenacious struggle of all oppressed people against their oppressors.

After escaping from Nan Batian's dungeon, Wu Qinghua fell into his clutches again, was beaten to the brink of death, and was abandoned in the wilderness. Why? Because Wu Qinghua had not found the Party, had not found the revolutionary path, and had not grasped the gun. This is a serious problem facing all revolutionary people: to get rid of exploitation and oppression, what should one rely on? Where is the way out? Regarding this fundamental question of the revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao has long made a wise judgment: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the power of the gun." It was under the guidance of the Party representative Hong Changqing that Wu Qinghua found the Party, joined the Red Detachment of Women, took the revolutionary path, grasped the gun, and understood that only by destroying the system of exploitation and overthrowing the reactionary regime that oppresses the people can one achieve liberation. It was under the leadership of the Party, with the cooperation of the broad masses of laboring people, that the Red Detachment of Women used revolutionary armed forces to destroy the counter-revolutionary armed forces, overthrew Nan Batian, liberated the coconut grove, and brought the oppressed and exploited laboring masses to see the light of day. The ballet "Red Detachment of Women" vividly reveals, with full political enthusiasm and vivid artistic power, that the suffering people can only achieve thorough liberation by taking up the gun and taking the path of armed seizure of political power. It also tells all the oppressed and exploited people of the world that to strive for independence and freedom, one must take up the gun and take the path of armed seizure of political power, which is the only correct path.

The path taken by Wu Qinghua on stage is the path taken by our revolutionary forebears, the path taken by the Chinese people to overthrow oppression and seek liberation. My hometown, Hainan Island, is the birthplace of the Red Detachment of Women and the place where the Red Detachment of Women Company operated. My mother and aunt were both soldiers of the Red Detachment of Women Company. They, like Wu Qinghua, suffered immense oppression and exploitation by landlords in the old society, and their hearts burned with the fire of resistance and struggle. Later, they found the Party and joined the Red Detachment of Women. The Red Detachment of Women had very few weapons at the time, and some used only swords and spears. They fought against the enemy's modern weapons with these inferior equipment. The Red Detachment of Women operated in the deep mountains and forests, eating wild vegetables when there was no food and covering themselves with banana leaves when there was no clothing. It was under these extremely harsh conditions that they attacked the enemy from all sides, driving the enemy into a state of panic. As a descendant of the Red Detachment of Women soldiers, I watched the revolutionary ballet "Red Detachment of Women" and felt even more deeply moved and educated, further realizing that all revolutionary struggles are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought! The path indicated by Chairman Mao is the most correct path. The Chinese people seized power from the three major enemies and achieved this victory under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, by using revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces.

However, the great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi has always opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, advocating that "all political struggles should be resolved peacefully," which is sheer nonsense. Was it "peaceful resolution" when Nan Batian imprisoned and tortured Wu Qinghua? Was it "peaceful resolution" when millions of Kuomintang troops attacked the Communist Party? Was it "peaceful resolution" when Japanese imperialism slaughtered the Chinese people at will? No, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no! All enemies attempt to resolve issues through force to maintain their evil rule. The Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi's so-called "peaceful resolution" is entirely from the standpoint of the exploiting class, and his fallacy is a sedative, attempting to make the oppressed people abandon armed struggle and continue to be slaughtered by the exploiting class. We must not fall for his trick!

Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, and the whole country (except Taiwan Province) has turned red. However, domestic and foreign class enemies will not be reconciled and will continue to try every means to sabotage and conspire to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship. We must be a hundred times more vigilant. Our Red Detachment of Women Militia Squad guards the frontline of the South China Sea, bearing a great responsibility. We are determined to take Wu Qinghua as our example, inherit the glorious tradition of the Red Detachment of Women, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, be both pioneers in the revolution and models in production, and use revolutionary guns to defend proletarian dictatorship.

    枪杆子里面出政权
    ——革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》观后
    海南岛琼海县红色娘子军基干民兵排排长　云大兰
    革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，描述了海南地区人民在第二次国内革命战争时期，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，一支革命妇女武装——红色娘子军跟地主、恶霸、国民党反动派进行英勇斗争的事迹，真切地再现了伟大领袖毛主席领导的波澜壮阔的人民战争的伟大场面，突出地歌颂了毛主席的“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题”这一光辉思想。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的帷幕一拉开，就展现了一场激烈的阶级斗争场面。南霸天为了保持他那罪恶的反动政权，用土牢、铁镣、皮鞭对反抗者实行了最残酷、最野蛮的镇压，主人公吴清华的悲惨遭遇只不过是无数受迫害的阶级姊妹和劳动人民悲惨遭遇的缩影。但是，哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗；压迫愈深，反抗愈烈。吴清华这个苦大仇深的“丫头”，在南霸天阴暗的土牢、带血的皮鞭面前，不但没有屈服，而且奋起反抗，最后带着满身鞭痕和满腔仇恨，冲出了人间地狱。吴清华这种大无畏的斗争精神和革命气概，也是一切被压迫人民对压迫者进行顽强斗争的真实写照。
    吴清华冲出了南霸天的土牢以后，又落入南霸天的魔掌，被打得奄奄一息，弃于荒野。这是为什么？因为吴清华没有找到党，没有找到革命的路，没有掌握枪杆子。这是摆在一切要革命的人民面前的一个严重的问题：要想摆脱剥削、压迫，靠什么？出路到底在那里？对于这个革命的根本问题，伟大领袖毛主席早就作了英明的论断：“枪杆子里面出政权”，“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主”。吴清华正是在党代表洪常青的指引下，找到了党，参加了红色娘子军，走上了革命的路，掌握了枪杆子，懂得了只有消灭剥削制度，摧毁压迫人民的反动政权，才能获得自身的解放。红色娘子军正是在党的领导下，在广大劳动人民的配合下，用革命的武装消灭了反革命的武装，打倒了南霸天，解放了椰林寨，使被压迫、被剥削的劳动群众见了天日。芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》以饱满的政治热情，生动的艺术力量，深刻地揭示了受苦受难的人民只有拿起枪杆子，走武装夺取政权的道路，才能求得彻底的解放。同时也告诉全世界一切被压迫、被剥削的人民，要争取独立自由，只有拿起枪杆子，走武装夺取政权的道路，才是唯一正确的道路。
    舞台上反映的吴清华所走的道路，就是我们革命先辈所走的道路，就是中国人民闹翻身求解放的道路。我家乡海南岛乐万苏区就是当年红色娘子军的诞生地，也是红色娘子军连活动的地方。我的母亲和姨母就是当年红色娘子军连的战士，她们也和吴清华一样，在旧社会受尽地主的压迫剥削，心里燃烧着反抗、斗争的烈火，后来找到了党，参加了红色娘子军。红色娘子军当时武器很少，有些人用的还是大刀、长矛，她们就凭着这些劣势装备和敌人的洋枪洋炮干。红色娘子军成年活动在深山野林里，没有吃的就拿野菜充饥，没有穿的就用芭蕉叶遮身，就是在这样极其艰苦的条件下，她们四处袭击敌人，把敌人打得焦头烂额。作为红色娘子军战士的后代，我看了革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，感触更深，受教育更大，更加体会到一切革命斗争的胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！毛主席指引的道路，是最正确的道路。中国人民从三大敌人手里夺取了政权，就是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，以革命的武装反对反革命武装取得的胜利果实。
    可是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇一贯对抗毛主席的革命路线，胡说什么：“一切政治斗争要和平解决”，真是胡说八道。难道南霸天关押、毒打吴清华是在“和平解决”吗？几百万国民党武装向共产党进攻是在“和平解决”吗？日本帝国主义对中国人民任意屠杀是在“和平解决”吗？不是，一千个不是，一万个不是！一切敌人都是企图用武力解决问题，借以维持他们的罪恶统治。中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇提出所谓“和平解决”，是完全站在剥削阶级的立场上说话，他的谬论是一付麻醉剂，妄图要受压迫人民放弃武装斗争，继续受剥削阶级的宰割。我们决不能上他的当！
    今天，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，全国（除台湾省外）实现了一片红，但是，国内外阶级敌人是不会甘心的，他们还会千方百计地进行破坏，阴谋颠覆我们的无产阶级专政。我们必须百倍警惕。我们红色娘子军基干民兵排，守卫在祖国南海最前哨，肩上责任重大，我们决心以吴清华为榜样，继承红色娘子军的光荣传统，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，既做抓革命的先锋，又做促生产的模范，用革命的枪杆子保卫无产阶级专政。
