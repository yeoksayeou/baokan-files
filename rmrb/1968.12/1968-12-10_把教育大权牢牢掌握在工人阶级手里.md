After reading the suggestions made by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu, we fully agree. We would also like to share our views: The key to determining whether a school's system reform has implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives on educational revolution lies in whether it can ensure that the working class leads the school and continues to lead it; whether it can ensure that intellectuals do not detach themselves from labor and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers; and whether it can build a revolutionary teaching staff. Among these three points, the issue of "power" is the key.

The Zhangjiakou Chaoyang Middle School, which we have entered, is a privately-run urban middle school. After its establishment in 1964, the school was managed by the district committee of the city. The school set up a metalworking factory and established a farm in the suburbs, implementing a "half-study, half-labor" system. The teachers' salaries and all school expenses were covered by students' labor. Practice has shown that such a privately-run school is better than a state-run school that is detached from production, class struggle, and political work. However, we feel that such a school is still not the ideal school of the working class and is not truly led by the working class. Instead, the school leads the factory, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school has not been fundamentally changed. Because the school leads the factory, phenomena such as "top grades in the classroom, top skills in the workshop, and money as the guiding principle in the mind" have emerged. Many students have unclear labor goals and harbor the idea of mastering skills to find an "iron rice bowl" in the future. Teachers also do not receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In August of this year, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of workers entered the school and adopted the management method of factories running schools, implementing proletarian political leadership. They took teachers and students to factories and workshops, combining labor with addressing students' active thoughts, lecturing on the history of the struggle between the two lines, class struggle, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, and carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. This has raised the class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines among teachers and students, helping them understand the significance and purpose of labor, and bringing about profound changes in the school. Even some students who previously feared labor and feared being assigned to rural areas, and thus found excuses not to come to school, have now all returned to school to make revolution.

We believe that only by having factories run schools can we thoroughly smash the revisionist educational system, keep the power of education firmly in the hands of the working class, and cultivate genuine successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

    把教育大权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手里
    看了侯振民、王庆余两同志的建议，我们很赞成。现在也谈一点我们的看法：看一个学校的体制改革是否落实了毛主席关于教育革命的一系列最新指示，最关键的是看能不能保证工人阶级领导学校，并且永远领导学校；能不能保证知识分子不脱离劳动，接受工农兵的再教育；能不能建设一支革命化的教师队伍。这三者当中，“权”的问题是关键的关键。
    我们进驻的张家口朝阳中学，是一所城市民办中学。这个学校在一九六四年建立后，属于本市的区委会管理。学校办了五金厂，并在市郊办了农场，实行学习、劳动“对半制”。教师工资及学校一切经费开支，都由学生参加劳动解决。实践证明，这样的民办中学比“三脱离”的公办中学好。但是，我们觉得这样的学校还不完全是工人阶级理想的学校，还不是工人阶级领导学校，而是学校领导工厂，资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象并没有彻底改变。由于学校领导工厂，就出现了“课堂上分数第一，工棚里技术第一，头脑里金钱挂帅”的现象。不少学生劳动目的不明确，抱着学好技术将来找“铁饭碗”的想法，教师也得不到工农兵的再教育。
    今年八月，工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进学校后，采用了工厂办校的管理方法，实行无产阶级政治领导。他们把师生带到工厂、车间，边劳动，边结合学生中的活思想，讲两条路线斗争史，讲阶级斗争，忆苦思甜，开展革命大批判，使师生提高了阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，认清了劳动的意义和目的，学校发生了深刻的变化。过去一些怕劳动、怕将来分配到农村而借故不来学校的学生，也都纷纷回校闹革命了。
    我们认为，只有工厂办学校，才能彻底砸烂修正主义教育体制，把教育大权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手里，培养出真正的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
