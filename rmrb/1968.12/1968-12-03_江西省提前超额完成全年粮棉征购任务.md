Under the great inspiration of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi Province, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have completed the annual procurement tasks for grain and cotton ahead of schedule and in excess of quotas with high revolutionary enthusiasm. By November 20, the province had procured and stored grain exceeding the state plan by 3.8 percent, and cotton by 2 percent. Compared with the same period last year, grain increased by 60 percent, and cotton by 78 percent. The tasks were completed more than a month earlier than in previous years.

The publication of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party was a great political impetus for Jiangxi Province to complete the annual procurement tasks for grain and cotton ahead of schedule and in excess of quotas. After the publication of the communiqué, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province held tens of thousands of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in courtyards and fields, earnestly studying, resolutely implementing, and comprehensively carrying out Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and the communiqué of the plenary session. They launched a massive "people's war" to besiege the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi in the fields of autumn harvest, autumn sowing, and autumn grain procurement, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle. The more they carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, the more they hated Liu Shaoqi; the more they studied Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the more they loved Chairman Mao, and the more they wanted to contribute more grain and cotton to Chairman Mao to express their loyalty. Yiyang County, which had already completed the annual grain procurement task in excess of quotas, delivered more than 10 million jin of surplus grain in the 10 days after the publication of the communiqué.

    江西省提前超额完成全年粮棉征购任务
    在党的八届十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，无限忠于毛主席的江西省广大贫下中农，以高度的革命热情，提前超额完成了全年粮食、棉花交售任务。到十一月二十日，全省征购入库的粮食超过国家计划百分之三点八，棉花超额百分之二。与去年同期比较，粮食增加百分之六十，棉花增加百分之七十八，完成任务的时间比往年提前一个多月。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，是江西省提前超额完成全年粮食、棉花征购任务的巨大政治动力。在全会公报发表以后，全省广大贫下中农在屋场、田头办起了数以万计的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习、坚决贯彻、全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示和全会公报，深入开展革命大批判，在秋收、秋种、秋粮征购的战场上，发动了声势浩大的围剿叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“人民战争”。他们越开展革命大批判，对刘少奇越恨；越学习毛主席的革命路线，对毛主席越亲，越要多交粮、棉，向毛主席敬献忠心。已经超额完成全年粮食征购任务的弋阳县，在公报发表后的十天内，又超额交售了一千多万斤余粮。
