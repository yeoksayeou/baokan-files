The relocation of public primary schools to the brigade level is a great revolution that touches people's souls. If one thinks from the standpoint of "self," the more one thinks, the more confused one becomes, the farther one is from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the less one understands the great significance of relocating public primary schools to the brigade level. If one thinks from the standpoint of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, everything becomes clear.

When I heard on the radio the suggestions of Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu regarding the relocation of public primary schools to the brigade level, and the editorial note from the People's Daily, my heart was stirred: I had just graduated from the normal school and became a primary school teacher. Although the salary was not high, I was still a state cadre, enjoying free medical care, a seemingly unbreakable "iron rice bowl." If I were to be relocated to the production brigade, people would say, "Look at Ji Shentian, after studying for more than ten years, he still can't escape being a commune member..." The more I thought about "self," the more confused I became, the farther I was from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the less I understood the great significance of relocating public primary schools to the brigade level.

With these questions in mind, I attended a study class on Mao Zedong Thought organized by the commune revolutionary committee. In the class, I seriously studied the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the education revolution. I repeatedly studied the "Three Old Articles" and severely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Many old poor peasants used their past class bitterness and national hatred, along with the facts of Liu Shaoqi's mad opposition to Chairman Mao and his efforts to promote feudal, capitalist, and revisionist educational goods, to re-educate us. This time, my heart became clear, and I realized that relocating public primary schools to the brigade level is an important measure to prevent revisionism. My temporary confusion was due to the influence of Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" poison.

I studied in the old school system for more than ten years, and this traitor Liu Shaoqi deceived me. Bourgeois ideology corrupted me. A handful of bourgeois intellectuals said, "Study hard, and you will become an official in the future, with fame and wealth." For more than ten years, I knelt at the desk, buried in books, "deaf to the world outside the window." After graduation, I became a teacher with the words "fame," "power," and "profit" in mind, always thinking that I was paid by the state, ate from the state's granary, and was led by the county's education bureau, superior to poor and lower-middle peasants, and completely disregarding the poor and lower-middle peasants, and being incompatible with them.

The original teachers' party branch was controlled by a traitor who faithfully promoted Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official," "priority to college entrance," and "grades first" junk. He said nonsense like, "As long as the number of students admitted to college is high, teachers can get a pay raise, and if things go well, they can become principals or directors." I was poisoned deeper and deeper, burying myself in books and assignments every day, not caring about politics, not engaging in class struggle, and not participating in collective production labor. I taught students the feudal and bourgeois idea of "all other professions are inferior, only studying is superior."

Under the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, as soon as students entered the school, they wanted new clothes and good food. Some students, after graduation, if they could not be admitted to college, would cry and be unwilling to engage in agricultural production. Poor and lower-middle peasants sharply criticized, saying, "Such a school is better not to have. Children entering the school become greedy, lazy, and blind." Thinking of these things, I gradually understood that Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, is the culprit, and his counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts must be thoroughly eliminated.

In the revolutionary criticism, the more I criticized, the more I hated Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and the more I loved Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. I felt that the suggestions of Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu were very good. Relocating public primary schools to the brigade level has a thousand advantages and ten thousand advantages. The greatest advantage is that it truly implements Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Schools managed by poor and lower-middle peasants can follow the path of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," promote the thought revolution of our teachers, cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause according to Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that people do not change and the country does not change color.

Thinking of this, my heart was warm. I had put the revolutionary and national affairs behind my mind, calculating personal gains and losses, which is how could I repay Chairman Mao, my savior! Teachers like me, with minds full of "fame," "power," and "profit," how could we cultivate students who love Chairman Mao infinitely and are dedicated to the public? I deeply felt that relocating public primary schools to the brigade level is a great revolution that touches people's souls. If one thinks from the standpoint of the bourgeois "self," the more one thinks, the more confused one becomes; if one thinks from the standpoint of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, everything becomes clear. The brigade revolutionary committee director, Wang Rujiang, who studied with us in the class, enthusiastically shook my hand and said, "Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, drew a line between us, and Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts filled the gap. Welcome back to our brigade to make a revolution."

As soon as the study class ended, I packed my bags and happily returned to my brigade. As soon as I put down my bag, the brigade revolutionary committee, poor peasants' representative assembly, and many poor and lower-middle peasants came to ask about my situation. We immediately organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for all the public school teachers, cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants who returned to the brigade. Through the study, I further realized that poor and lower-middle peasants are the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and can manage schools according to Mao Zedong Thought. We worked together to renovate the classrooms, formulate new teaching plans, reform unreasonable regulations, and enroll all the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor and lower-middle peasants took to the podium, and the whole school presented a new look.

Now, my thoughts and feelings have changed greatly, and I am closer to the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the future, I am determined to follow this bright path forever.

    彻底肃清大叛徒刘少奇“读书做官论”的流毒
    公办小学下放到大队来办，是一场触及人们灵魂的大变革。站在“私”字上想，越想越糊涂，离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越远，对公办小学下放到大队办的伟大意义越认识不清；站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上想，一通百通。
    当我从广播里听到侯振民、王庆余同志关于把公办小学下放到大队来办的建议和《人民日报》编者按后，心里直翻腾：好容易中师毕了业，当了个小学教员，工资虽不多，可也算个国家干部，又享受公费医疗，是打不破的“铁饭碗”啊！要是下放到生产大队，人家会说，看你冀慎田，上了十几年的学，还脱不了当社员……。我越围绕着“私”字想，越糊涂，离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越远，对公办小学下放到大队办的伟大意义越认识不清。
    带着这些问题，我进了公社革委会举办的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，认真学习了党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报和毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示，反复学习了“老三篇”，狠批了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线。许多老贫农用过去的阶级苦、民族恨和刘少奇疯狂反对毛主席、极力推行封、资、修教育黑货的罪恶事实，对我们进行再教育。这下，我心里亮堂了，认识到公办小学下放到大队来办，是反修防修的重要措施。自己一时想不通，是受了刘少奇“读书做官论”流毒的影响。
    我在旧学校读了十多年书，刘少奇这个大叛徒坑害了我，资产阶级思想腐蚀了我。一小撮资产阶级知识分子说：“好好读书，今后就能当干部，有名有利。”十多年，我就为名为利趴在课桌上死读书，“两耳不闻窗外事”。毕业后，我带着“名”、“权”、“利”三个字当了教师，总认为自己拿国家钱，吃国库粮，受县文教局领导，比贫下中农高一等，根本没有把贫下中农放在眼里，和贫下中农格格不入。
    原教师党支部，被一个叛徒把持着。他忠实地推行刘少奇的“读书做官”、“升学第一”、“分数挂帅”等破烂货，胡说什么：“只要升学的人数多，教师就能提工资，弄好了还给个校长、主任干干。”我中毒越来越深，整天钻在书堆里，埋在作业里，不问政治，不管阶级斗争，不参加集体生产劳动。向学生讲的是“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的封建主义、资产阶级那一套。
    在刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害下，学生一进校门，穿衣就要新的，吃饭要好的。有些学生毕了业，升不上学，就哭哭啼啼，不安心农业生产。贫下中农尖锐地批评说：“这样的学校不如不办，孩子进了学校，学馋了，学懒了，学瞎了。”想到这些，我慢慢懂得了，刘少奇这个大叛徒是罪魁祸首，必须彻底肃清他的反革命修正主义思想。
    在革命大批判中，越批，对刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线越恨，对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线越亲，越感到侯振民、王庆余二位同志的倡议好得很。公办小学下放到大队来办，有一千个好，一万个好，最大的好处是真正落实了毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示。学校由贫下中农管理，就能沿着“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的道路前进，就能促进我们教师思想革命化，按照毛泽东思想培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，使人不变质，国不变色。
    想到这里，我心里热辣辣的。革命的大事，国家的大事，我放在脑后，斤斤计较个人得失，这哪能对得起救命恩人毛主席！象我这样满脑子“名”、“权”、“利”的教师，哪能培养出无限热爱毛主席、一心为公的学生？！我深刻体会到，公办小学下放到大队来办，是一场触及人们灵魂的大变革，站在资产阶级“私”字上想，越想越糊涂；站在毛主席革命路线上想，一通百通。在学习班学习的我们大队革命委员会主任王如刚同志，热情地握着我的手说：“刘少奇这个大叛徒给咱们之间划了一道沟，毛主席的教育革命思想给咱们把沟填平了，欢迎你回咱大队闹革命。”
    学习班一结束，我就背起了行李，高高兴兴地回到本大队。刚放下背包，大队革委会、贫代会的同志和许多贫下中农都找上门来向我问长问短。我们立即举办了所有回本大队的公办教师、干部、贫下中农三结合的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习，我进一步认识到，贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席最忠，最能按照毛泽东思想管理学校。我们一齐动手，修整了教室，制定了新的教学计划，改革了不合理的规章制度，贫下中农子女全部入学，贫下中农登上了讲台，全校出现了崭新的面貌。
    现在，我的思想感情发生了很大变化，和贫下中农贴近了，办事往一处想，说话一个调。今后，我决心沿着这条光明大道永远走下去。
