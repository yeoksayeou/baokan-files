"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast an article on the 16th calling on all ethnic groups in Thailand to, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, persistently wage armed revolutionary struggles to fight for their liberation.

The article points out that the Communist Party of Thailand represents the interests of all ethnic groups in Thailand. Its national policy genuinely reflects the fundamental interests and demands of all ethnic groups in Thailand, earning the sincere support of all ethnic groups in Thailand and greatly inspiring the revolutionary struggles of all ethnic groups in Thailand.

The article points out that the various minority ethnic groups in Thailand have long suffered from the oppression of imperialism and the national discrimination of the Thai reactionary ruling class. They not only have been brutally deprived of their political rights but also lack even the most basic living rights, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses.

The article says that the Communist Party of Thailand has consistently and resolutely opposed the national oppression of imperialism and the national discrimination of the Thai reactionary ruling class. It bravely leads the various minority ethnic groups to rise up, take up arms, and fight against U.S. imperialism and the Sarit traitorous clique. The armed forces of all ethnic groups in Thailand have become an important revolutionary force in the national democratic revolution to expel the U.S. and overthrow the Sarit clique.

The article points out that only the Communist Party of Thailand, a proletarian party guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, can implement a correct national policy and genuinely represent the interests of all ethnic groups in Thailand.

The article says that the national policy of the Communist Party of Thailand greatly inspires all ethnic groups in Thailand, pointing out the path to liberation for them. It can be affirmed that the armed struggles of all ethnic groups, inspired by the policy of the Communist Party of Thailand, will develop more rapidly and, together with the people of the entire nation, launch more fierce attacks on the U.S.-Sarit clique.

    “泰国人民之声”指出泰国共产党是泰国各族人民利益的代表
    号召各族人民拿起武器为争取解放而战斗
    据新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十六日广播一篇文章号召泰国各族人民在泰国共产党的正确领导下，坚持不懈地进行革命武装斗争，为争取自己的解放而战斗。
    文章指出，泰国共产党是泰国各族人民利益的代表，它的民族政策真正反映了泰国各族人民的根本利益和要求，获得泰国各族人民的衷心拥护，极大地鼓舞着泰国各族人民的革命斗争。
    文章指出，泰国各少数民族长期以来遭受帝国主义的压迫和泰国反动统治阶级的民族歧视，他们不但被野蛮地剥夺了政治权利，而且连起码的生活权利也没有保障，过着牛马不如的生活。
    文章说，泰国共产党一贯地坚决反对帝国主义的民族压迫和泰国反动统治阶级的民族歧视，勇敢地领导各少数民族起来斗争，拿起武器反对美帝国主义和他侬卖国集团。泰国各族人民武装已成为驱逐美帝、推翻他侬集团的民族民主革命中的一股重要革命力量。
    文章指出，只有泰国共产党这样一个以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指针的无产阶级政党，才能够执行正确的民族政策，才能够真正代表泰国各族人民的利益。
    文章说，泰国共产党的民族政策极大地鼓舞泰国各族人民，给他们指出了争取解放的道路。可以肯定，各族人民武装斗争在泰共政策的鼓舞下，必将更加迅猛发展，并和全国人民一起向美国—他侬集团发动更猛烈进攻。
