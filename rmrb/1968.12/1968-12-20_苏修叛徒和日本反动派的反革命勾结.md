    The Soviet revisionist traitor clique and the Japanese reactionaries have been engaged in intense counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities in recent years. They have developed from an economic "cooperation" relationship to political and military collusion. The Soviet revisionists and the Japanese reactionaries are also brewing a so-called "treaty of friendship and good neighborliness" under the pretext of "friendship and good neighborliness" to hasten the establishment of the "Moscow-Tokyo axis" and to cobble together an anti-China, counter-revolutionary alliance.

    The counter-revolutionary collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese reactionaries is actually an extension of the Soviet-American collusion. It is known that U.S. imperialism, in order to pursue its policy of aggression and war in Asia, has actively revived the forces of Japanese militarism, attempting to make it a henchman in Asia's war of aggression and a base in the anti-China encirclement. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, driven by its counter-revolutionary needs, also vigorously supports and colludes with Japanese militarism. The Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism sing the same tune, praising Japanese militarism as the "stabilizing force in Asia." Both the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism want to use Japanese militarism in Asia; their evil goals are to oppose socialist China and jointly suppress revolutionary movements in various Asian countries.

    The military collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese reactionaries has become increasingly blatant. The Soviet revisionist traitors not only openly condone and encourage the U.S.-Japan military alliance but also hasten to join forces with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to encircle China militarily. However, the Soviet people will never forget that in the early days of the Soviet state, the iron hoofs of Japanese militarism trampled on Soviet territory and massacred Soviet people. Japanese militarism has always been the enemy of the Soviet people. Today, the Soviet revisionist clique has gone mad and colluded with Japanese militarism, pointing their guns together at the great socialist China. This nakedly exposes the Soviet revisionist clique as a bunch of counter-revolutionaries who have betrayed the Soviet people!

    In order to collude with Japanese militarism to jointly oppose China, the Soviet revisionists do not hesitate to sell out the national sovereignty, natural resources, and people's interests of the Soviet Union to the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is fully opening the seas, land, and skies of Siberia to Japanese monopoly capital, allowing Japanese monopoly capital to exploit and plunder the Soviet people. Living proof shows that the Soviet revisionists are not only social imperialists but also unadulterated traitors.

    The communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China points out: "No matter how much garbage the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists gather, or what kind of 'holy alliance' they organize to oppose China and the revolution, it will only be 'lifting a rock to drop on one's own foot.'"

    The counter-revolutionary collusion between the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and the Japanese reactionaries, under the instigation and tacit agreement of U.S. imperialism, will inevitably face severe punishment from the Chinese people, Soviet people, Japanese people, and the people of various Asian countries. U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, the Soviet revisionists are a paper tiger, and the Japanese reactionaries are a paper tiger. They are all sitting on the volcano of people's revolution. No matter how much garbage U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionists gather, or what kind of anti-China, counter-revolutionary alliance they cobble together, they cannot save themselves from failure and annihilation.

    苏修叛徒和日本反动派的反革命勾结
    本报评论员
    苏修叛徒集团同日本反动派之间近年来一直在进行紧张的反革命阴谋活动。它们已经从经济上的“合作”关系，发展到了政治上和军事上的勾结。苏修同日本反动派还酝酿着一项以“睦邻友好”为幌子的所谓“和约”，来加紧建立“莫斯科—东京枢轴”，拚凑反华、反革命的联盟。
    苏修同日本反动派的反革命勾结，实际上是苏美勾结的延长。人们知道，美帝国主义为了在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策，积极复活日本军国主义势力，企图使它充当亚洲侵略战争中的一名打手和反华包围圈中的一个基地。苏修叛徒集团从它的反革命的需要出发，也竭力扶植和勾结日本军国主义。苏修同美帝唱一个调子，吹捧日本军国主义是什么“亚洲的稳定力量”。苏修和美帝在亚洲都要起用日本军国主义，它们的罪恶目标都是要反对社会主义的中国，共同镇压亚洲各国的革命运动。
    苏修同日本反动派的军事勾结，已经做得越来越露骨。苏修叛徒不仅公然纵容和鼓励美日军事同盟，而且加紧同美日反动派联合起来，从军事上包围中国。但是，苏联人民决不会忘记，在苏维埃国家诞生之初，日本军国主义的铁蹄曾经践踏过苏联的国土，屠杀过苏联的人民，日本军国主义始终是苏联人民的敌人。今天，苏修集团竟然丧心病狂地同日本军国主义结成同伙，把它们的枪口一起对准了伟大的社会主义中国。这赤裸裸地暴露了苏修集团是一伙背叛苏联人民的反革命！
    苏修为了勾结日本军国主义共同反华，不惜向日本垄断资本集团出卖苏联的国家主权、自然资源和人民利益。苏修叛徒集团正在把西伯利亚的海面、陆地和天空向日本垄断资本全面开放，让日本垄断资本来剥削和榨取苏联人民。活生生的事实证明，苏修既是社会帝国主义者，同时又是不折不扣的卖国贼。
    中国共产党的八届十二中全会公报指出：“不管美帝、苏修拚凑一些什么垃圾，组织反华、反革命的‘神圣同盟’，都只能是‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。”
    苏修叛徒集团在美帝国主义的怂恿和默契下，同日本反动派进行的反革命勾结，必将遭到中国人民、苏联人民、日本人民和亚洲各国人民的严厉惩罚。美帝是纸老虎，苏修是纸老虎，日本反动派是纸老虎。它们都坐在人民革命的火山口上。美帝苏修不管汇聚多少垃圾，拚凑什么样的反华、反革命联盟，都不能挽救它们自己的失败和灭亡。
