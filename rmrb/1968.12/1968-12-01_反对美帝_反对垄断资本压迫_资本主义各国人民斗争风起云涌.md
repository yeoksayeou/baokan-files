	The Struggle of the People in Capitalist Countries Is Sweeping

	Australian Masses Hold Angry Protest March
	Do Not Allow the Government to Provide Cannon Fodder for the U.S. Imperialists

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, November 26, about a thousand Australian masses held a rally and protest march on November 25 to strongly protest against the reactionary Australian government's expansion of conscription, providing cannon fodder for the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam. The protesters also demanded the withdrawal of the Australian mercenary troops invading Vietnam.

	Turkish Students Take to the Streets Again
	Angrily Protesting the Arrival of the New U.S. Ambassador

	According to Xinhua News Agency, November 29, Ankara, Turkey: Nearly a thousand Turkish patriotic students held an anti-U.S. demonstration on November 28 at Ankara Airport, the capital of Turkey, angrily protesting the arrival of the new U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Robert Komer. When Komer arrived, the demonstrating students angrily shouted slogans such as "Yankees go home!" and "Turkey wants independence!" and publicly rebuked the U.S. embassy officials who came to the airport to welcome Komer.

	In the face of the Turkish patriotic students' anti-U.S. roar, the U.S. plane carrying Komer landed and quickly slid to the end of the runway. Komer then jumped into a car that had been prepared in advance and, under the protection of hundreds of Turkish military police, bypassed the demonstrating students and fled the airport in a disgraced manner.

	Before taking up his post as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Komer was the "deputy ambassador" to the U.S.-backed puppet regime in South Vietnam, a butcher with the blood of the South Vietnamese people on his hands. He had also worked for twelve years in the notorious U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, an old-time professional spy. Two days before his arrival in Turkey, Turkish student organizations had been distributing leaflets on the streets of Ankara, announcing that Komer was an "unwelcome person" and calling on the people to drive this villain away.

	Colombian Students Launch Struggle
	Oppose U.S. Imperialist Cultural Aggression

	According to Xinhua News Agency, November 30, Bogota, Colombia: Colombian university students have recently been continuously fighting against U.S. imperialist cultural aggression.

	Students at the National University of Colombia demanded the abolition of contracts signed by the authorities with U.S. cultural aggression organizations such as the "Ford Foundation" and "Fulbright Scholarship." Students at the university's College of Humanities recently abolished two courses taught by a U.S. imperialist agent disguised as a "professor."

	On November 26, 3,800 students at Los Andes University, a school run by Americans in the capital, Bogota, went on strike to protest against the increase in tuition fees. It is reported that this is the first large-scale student strike in the history of this school.

	Italian Student Movement Gathers Momentum
	Dealing a Heavy Blow to the Reactionary Ruling Group

	According to Xinhua News Agency, November 30, Rome, Italy: The struggle of Italian students against the decadent capitalist education system and the reactionary authorities' suppression of the student movement is sweeping across Italy. High school and college students are boycotting classes, occupying schools, holding demonstrations and protest rallies, and the student movement is surging with increasing momentum, striking a heavy blow to the Italian reactionary ruling group.

	In Milan, Italy's second-largest city, more than ten thousand students held a massive demonstration on November 28 to oppose the authorities' persecution of students and demand the freedom to assemble. Among the demonstrators were seven thousand high school students who were still on strike, strongly protesting the police's use of force against students who had occupied two schools. The demonstrators also occupied two more schools.

	On the same day, students at Milan National University occupied the chemistry department of the university; students at the Catholic University continued to occupy the normal school and the engineering school of the university.

	In southern Italy's Campobasso, more than five thousand students also held a general strike on November 28 and took to the streets to demonstrate. They held up placards with the words: "Long live the unity of workers and students!"

	On the same day, in northern Italy's Mantua, more than two thousand students held a march to protest the police's use of force against students who had occupied a school. They also demanded the right to hold meetings on campus.

	Cyprus Swept by Strike Wave
	Ruling Group in Panic

	According to Xinhua News Agency, November 27, Nicosia, Cyprus: A surging wave of strikes has recently swept across Cyprus.

	More than two thousand telecommunications workers across Cyprus have been on strike for over a week, demanding a wage increase. The strike by telecommunications workers has cut off Cyprus' telecommunications with the outside world and caused telephone and telegraph communications on the island to completely break down.

	Workers in government-operated power, water, broadcasting, and various municipal agencies have also gone on strike in recent days to support the telecommunications workers' struggle. They said that if the government continues to stubbornly reject the reasonable demands of the telecommunications workers, they will go on a long strike.

	The surging wave of strikes has made the ruling group of Cyprus panic-stricken. The organization of Cypriot capitalists, the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is also worried, fearing that the strike wave will further surge, dealing a heavier blow to the capitalists.
