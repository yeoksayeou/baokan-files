In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entering its great stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved and the Central Military Commission issued an order to confer the honorable title of "Advanced Medical Department Wholeheartedly Serving the People" upon the medical department of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region. This has set a brilliant banner of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and wholeheartedly serving the people for the entire army.

Defending Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

Creating Miracles in Medical History

This March, the medical department, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, successfully removed a 90-jin tumor from the abdomen of female community member Zhang Qiuju, creating a rare miracle in the history of world medicine. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian health line!

In 1964, after Zhang Qiuju discovered she had a tumor, she sought medical help at several large hospitals, but because she was an ordinary community member, the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" did not care about her life or death, labeling it an "incurable disease" and pushing her out the door. Later, Zhang Qiuju's husband wrote to the old Ministry of Health, which replied: "China has no solution, the world has no solution." As a result, her condition worsened.

After learning about Zhang Qiuju's painful ordeal, the medical department felt deeply that this was evidence of the counterrevolutionary revisionist line pushed by the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi on the medical and health front. They believed that the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" used "incurable disease" as an excuse to push Zhang Qiuju out, which was essentially a cold-hearted disregard for the working people and a refusal to treat them. We are a team that wholeheartedly serves the people and must always prioritize the question of serving whom. We must firmly and unshakably serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They felt that the task before them was not just a simple matter of treating a disease, but a battle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

After admitting Zhang Qiuju, the medical department followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "strategically, we must despise all enemies; tactically, we must take all enemies seriously" and conducted a comprehensive and systematic examination of her, overturning the erroneous conclusions made by bourgeois "authorities" and deciding to perform surgery.

The medical department had poor equipment and few personnel and had never performed such a large surgery before. What should they do? Should they ask for experts or do it themselves? Should they rely on a few people or follow the mass line? The party branch, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses are the real heroes" and "we have always advocated that revolution depends on the people, everyone should participate, and opposed relying on a few people to issue orders." They deeply understood that who to rely on is not just a matter of method, but a matter of which line to follow. To implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must not only solve the question of serving whom, but also the question of relying on whom. In general situations, we should rely on the masses, and in complex situations, we should even more rely on the masses. With this spirit, they fully mobilized the masses, making all members of the department participate in this battle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

After more than twenty days of effort, everyone proposed ten "what ifs" for possible situations during the surgery, drafted more than 120 solutions, and formulated a complete surgical plan. They deeply felt that "the skills of experts are limited, but the wisdom of the masses is boundless!"

When Zhang Qiuju was first admitted, her despair was very serious. The medical department believed that to remove the large tumor from her body, they must first remove the "large tumor" from her mind. They used Mao Zedong Thought to arm Zhang Qiuju's mind and boost her confidence in overcoming the disease.

At 8 AM on March 23, a decisive battle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and rescue a class sister began!

The responsible comrade from the party committee entered the operating room and directed the battle with Mao Zedong Thought. Soon after the anesthesia began, the patient had difficulty breathing. At this critical moment, the party committee responsible comrade loudly read the highest directive: "We need a passionate but calm mood, tense but orderly work." The abdomen was cut open, and the tumor surface was tightly covered by a thin membrane. In the complex situation of not being able to distinguish between the tumor membrane and the abdominal membrane, Chairman Mao's teachings on "our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must be in the interest of the people" rang in everyone's ears. The tumor was exposed, but how to remove it? The political command group sent Chairman Mao's teachings: "First, attack the scattered and isolated enemy, then attack the concentrated and powerful enemy." "Surround the enemy on all sides and strive for complete annihilation."

Chairman Mao's words, like golden sunlight, illuminated everyone's hearts and guided them through one danger after another, finally removing the rare tumor from the class sister's body. The more loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line,

The more completely and thoroughly one serves the people

The victory of the medical department in rescuing Zhang Qiuju was not accidental. It was the result of their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, their insistence on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and their resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Dongxian Middle School student Dong Hengyuan wrote a letter saying that his ears had been sick for a long time and requested the medical department to introduce treatment methods. The medical department's outpatient clinic comrades, with this question in mind, studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." They said that they should learn from Comrade Bethune's "extreme responsibility to work" and should go to the patient's home. Therefore, they sent military doctor Ying Zengli to make a special trip. Dong Hengyuan never expected the doctor to run over a hundred miles to provide medical care at home. He choked back tears and said many words of thanks to the medical department. Ying Zengli said, "Don't thank us, it is Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts that give us the motivation to wholeheartedly serve the people. We came to treat you because we listened to Chairman Mao's words."

Gou Village Commune member Li Shunzhuo had a hernia at the age of 20 and had suffered for 35 years. During the period of Kuomintang rule, he painstakingly saved ten yuan to go to a city hospital for surgery, but those bloodless murderers demanded a hundred yuan, and he returned home in disappointment. In 1964, he went to a large city hospital for surgery with great hope, but due to Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line on the medical and health front, he was not successfully treated. The medical department, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," organized a mobile medical team. With unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao and deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, they successfully performed surgery on Li Shunzhuo upon arriving at Gou Village Commune. Li Shunzhuo excitedly said, "Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line is the same as the Kuomintang reactionaries, a line that harms the people. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is a line that saves the poor and lower-middle peasants. I and my family will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and our descendants will follow Chairman Mao forever!"

During a field exercise, doctor Gao Jiazheng, who was marching with the troops, heard that several community members were carrying a sick person on a stretcher to the county city. He quickly went to inquire, and it turned out that a female community member had stomach pain. After checking, he found it was acute appendicitis. The place was seventy miles away from the county city, and the patient was in danger of dying on the way. He thought of Chairman Mao's instruction to "wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people" and immediately decided to perform surgery on the spot. There was no operating room, so he and the soldiers set up a tent; there was no operating table, so they borrowed a table to use. After strict disinfection, just as they were about to perform the surgery, it suddenly started raining heavily. The soldiers used raincoats to set up a small tent on the "operating table." Gao Jiazheng poured all his proletarian love for the people into every cut and stitch, successfully removing the patient's purulent appendix. The patient's family and the surrounding people continuously thanked Chairman Mao for cultivating such good doctors and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!"

The medical department's comrades wholeheartedly work for the health of the people. They do not mind cleaning up filth, carrying water and feeding patients, washing clothes and bedding, and treating injuries and diseases. Many of them have donated blood for their comrades more than once, spent holidays in the ward more than once, and forgotten personal matters for their class brothers more than once. For a long time, they have not sought fame or wealth, have not feared hardship or fatigue, and have thought of ways to treat whatever diseases the people have. Some doctors have learned multiple medical skills such as surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and traditional Chinese medicine, helping many class brothers to get rid of the torment of diseases.

The medical department's comrades not only treat diseases for the people but also enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought and arm the people with Mao Zedong Thought. They turned the outpatient clinic into a propaganda station for Mao Zedong Thought, the medical team into a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, and the ward into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. They said, "We must always think of the great leader Chairman Mao, forever engrave the sole purpose of the People's Liberation Army to wholeheartedly serve the people in our hearts, and in our actions, we must always embody the brilliant thoughts of the 'Three Articles,' and in our work, we must always propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we completely and thoroughly serve the people."

Turning Mao Zedong Thought into Their Soul

Forging Loyalty to Chairman Mao in Practice

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "The work of the army is complex and varied, as long as we vigorously study and apply Chairman Mao's works and grasp the education of the struggle between the two lines, all problems can be solved." The party branch of the medical department has, for a long time, especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, always regarded organizing all personnel to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines as the fundamental task.

Doctor Li Ziyuan grew from a medical orderly. The organization once sent him to study at the Military Medical University. Upon graduation, he thought that staying in the school to do research work or going to a large hospital to be a doctor would be more beneficial to improving his skills. After returning to the unit, he still had not completely freed himself from the "I" mentality. Soon, the masses sent a burned child, and he was afraid of not being able to treat it well and suggested transferring the patient. Why did the "self" emerge at the critical moment of serving the people? The party branch helped him study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" with this question in mind. He used Chairman Mao's teachings on "selflessly dedicating to the people" and "extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people" to examine himself, fought against the "self," raised his consciousness, and actively took on the treatment task. After more than two months of careful nursing and treatment, he cured the burned child. Everyone deeply felt from Li Ziyuan's study and application of Chairman Mao's works and transformation of thoughts that without thoroughly changing the bourgeois worldview, starting from oneself, even if one's skills improve, one cannot well serve the people. Only by constantly arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and actively raising the awareness of serving the people can one create and make progress.

To further forge the medical staff's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao in practice, over the years, the medical department has, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "we communists should go through wind and rain and see the world," while deeply entering the units, also entered the countryside, participated in the socialist education movement, and participated in the "Three Supports and Two Military" work and mobile medical care. In the heart-pounding class struggle, they constantly raised the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The medical team sent to Gou Village Commune was tempered and raised in the struggle. Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the locality pushed the counterrevolutionary revisionist line on the medical and health front, severely cutting the commune health stations, and under the guise of organizing "joint clinics," they encouraged medical staff to go it alone and promoted the capitalist road, causing serious harm to the rural health and sanitation cause. The medical team comrades, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, launched a revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line. Poor peasant Old Grandpa Wu angrily denounced: "In the old society, we were oppressed to the point of dried blood and broken bones. Many poor people died of illness without ever seeing a doctor. After liberation, Chairman Mao always cared about whether the poor and lower-middle peasants had medical treatment and medicine. But Liu Shaoqi pushed for capitalist restoration, making the countryside lack doctors and medicine. Isn't this taking us back to the old days?" The poor and lower-middle peasants' angry denunciation of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi gave the medical team comrades a deep education in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They actively helped the commune develop medical and health work and joined the great struggle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They saw that the commune health station could not perform general surgeries, and community members had to go to the city for treatment, delaying revolution and production. They helped the health station, with its humble facilities, establish a small operating room. In more than two months, they performed more than 100 surgeries, including appendectomies and hernia repairs, with no infections. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised, "You performed small surgeries but took the big direction, always thinking of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Now, the comrades of the medical department are actively participating in the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, determined to, under the guidance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, arm themselves with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in the waves of class struggle and in the process of getting close to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, constantly raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, make their lives a life of eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a life of eternal service to the people, and constantly achieve new merits for the people.

    无限忠于毛主席　全心全意为人民
    ——记北京部队某部“全心全意为人民服务的先进卫生科”
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入伟大的斗、批、改的高潮中，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，由中央军委发布命令，授予北京部队某部卫生科“全心全意为人民服务的先进卫生科”的光荣称号，为全军树立了一面无限忠于毛主席，全心全意为人民的鲜艳旗帜。
    捍卫毛主席革命路线
    创造医学史上的奇迹
    今年三月，这个卫生科高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，从女社员张秋菊腹中切除了一个九十斤重的大肿瘤，创造了世界医学史上罕见的奇迹。这是毛泽东思想的一个伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级卫生路线的一个伟大胜利！
    一九六四年张秋菊发现长了瘤子以后，先后到几个大医院登门求医，但是，因为她是个普通社员，资产阶级的技术“权威”根本不管她的死活，说是“不治之症”，就把她推出门外。后来，张秋菊的爱人又写信询问旧卫生部，旧卫生部的回答是：“中国没有办法，世界也没有办法。”结果，病情越来越重。
    卫生科的同志了解到张秋菊的痛苦遭遇以后，深深感到，这就是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在医疗卫生战线上推行反革命修正主义路线的罪证。他们认为，资产阶级“专家”、“权威”以“不治之症”为借口，把张秋菊推出门外，说穿了就是对劳动人民冷酷无情，实质上就是拒绝为劳动人民治病。我们是全心全意为人民服务的队伍，一定要把为什么人的问题始终摆在第一位，坚定不移地为广大工农兵群众服务。他们觉得摆在面前的不是一个普通的治病问题，而是一场捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗。
    卫生科收下张秋菊以后，遵照毛主席关于“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，全面系统地对她进行了三十二项检查，推翻了资产阶级“权威”所作的错误结论，决定给她动手术。
    这个卫生科设备差、人员少，从来没有做过这样大的手术，怎么办？是请专家还是自己干，是靠少数人还是走群众路线？党支部带着这个问题，学习了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”、“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令”等英明教导，深刻体会到：靠谁治病不是方法问题，而是执行那条路线的问题。要贯彻毛主席的革命路线，不仅要解决为什么人的问题，还要解决靠什么人的问题。在一般情况下，要依靠群众，在复杂情况下，更要依靠群众。他们本着这种精神，把群众充分发动起来，使全科同志都投入了这场捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗。
    经过二十多天的努力，大家针对手术中可能出现的情况，提出了十个“怎么办”，拟定了一百二十多条解决办法，制定了一个完整的手术方案。他们深有体会地说：“专家的技能是有限的，群众的智慧是无穷的！”
    张秋菊入院之初，绝望的情绪很严重。卫生科的同志认为，要搬掉她身体上的大瘤子，必须首先搬掉她精神上的“大瘤子”。他们就用毛泽东思想武装张秋菊的头脑，提高她战胜疾病的信心。
    三月二十三日八时，一场捍卫毛主席革命路线、抢救阶级姐妹的决战开始了！
    党委负责同志进入手术室，用毛泽东思想指挥战斗。麻醉开始不久，病人呼吸发生了困难。在这关键时刻，党委负责同志高声朗读最高指示：“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪，紧张而有秩序的工作。”肚皮切开了，瘤子表面紧紧蒙着一层薄膜。在难以辨认是瘤子膜还是腹膜的复杂情况下，毛主席关于“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益”的教导，就在大家的耳边响起。瘤子露出来了，用什么方法把它取出来？政治指挥组送来了毛主席的教导：“先打分散和孤立之敌，后打集中和强大之敌。”“四面包围敌人，力求全歼”。
    毛主席的话，象金色的阳光，照亮了每个人的心，指引着他们闯过道道险关，终于把罕见的肿瘤从阶级姐妹身上搬下来了。对毛主席革命路线越忠
    为人民服务越完全彻底
    卫生科抢救张秋菊战斗的胜利，绝不是偶然的，这是他们无限忠于毛主席，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决按照毛主席无产阶级革命路线办事的结果。
    涿县中学董恒元同学来了一封信，说他耳朵长期患病，请求卫生科介绍治疗方法。卫生科门诊所的同志们，带着这个问题学习了《纪念白求恩》。他们说，要学习白求恩同志“对工作的极端的负责任”，应该上门去找病人。于是，就派军医英增立专门去一趟。董恒元万万没有想到医生会跑一百多里送医上门。他含着泪花，说了很多感谢卫生科的话，英增立说：“不要感谢我们，是毛主席的光辉思想给了我们全心全意为人民服务的动力。我们是听了毛主席的话才来给你看病的。”
    郭村公社社员李顺琢，二十岁得疝气，已有三十五年。在国民党统治时期，他苦熬苦攒凑了十元钱到城市医院做手术，那些杀人不见血的家伙伸手就要一百元，他失望而归。一九六四年，他抱着很大希望第二次到城市大医院做手术，由于刘少奇在医疗卫生战线上推行反革命修正主义路线，又没有治成。这个卫生科遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导组织的巡回医疗队，怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，对刘少奇的深仇大恨，一到郭村公社，就成功地给李顺琢做了手术。李顺琢激动地说：“刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义路线和国民党反动派一样，是坑害人民群众的路线，毛主席的革命路线是拯救贫下中农的路线。我和全家要永远忠于毛主席，子孙万代跟着毛主席走！”
    一次野营，随部队行军的医生高家政，听说有几个社员用担架抬着一个病人往县城去。他便急忙前去询问，原来是一个女社员肚子疼。他一检查，是急性阑尾炎。这里离县城有七十多里山路，病人有死在路上的危险。他想起了毛主席的“全心全意地为中国人民服务”的教导，立即决定给病人就地动手术。没有手术室，他就和战士们一起支起帐篷；没有手术台，就借来桌子顶替。经过严格消毒，正要做手术时，突然下起大雨，战士们就用雨衣在“手术台”上边又支起个小帐篷。高家政把无限热爱人民群众的无产阶级感情，全部倾注在每一刀每一线上，顺利地切除了病人的化脓阑尾。病人的家属和周围群众，连连感谢毛主席培养了这样的好医生，不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    卫生科的同志就是这样全心全意地为人民群众的健康操劳。他们端屎端尿不怕脏，送水喂饭不怕烦，洗衣洗被不怕累，治伤治病不怕难。他们中的许多人不只一次地为战友献过鲜血，不只一次地在病房的劳碌中度过假日，不只一次地为阶级兄弟把个人事情完全忘却。长期以来，他们不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕累，人民群众有啥病，他们就想啥法，有的医生先后学会了外科、内科、妇科、儿科和中医医疗等多种医术，使许多阶级兄弟摆脱了疾病的折磨。
    卫生科的同志不但给群众治病，而且满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装群众。他们把门诊所办成毛泽东思想宣传站，把医疗队办成毛泽东思想宣传队，把病房办成了红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。他们说，我们就是要时刻想着伟大领袖毛主席，心头永远铭刻着人民解放军全心全意为人民服务的唯一宗旨，行动上处处体现“老三篇”的光辉思想，工作中时时宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，这才能完全彻底为人民服务。
    把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂
    在实践中锤炼忠于毛主席的红心
    林副主席指示我们：“部队工作千头万绪，只要大力活学活用毛主席著作，抓好两条路线斗争的教育，一切问题就可以迎刃而解。”卫生科党支部，长期以来，特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，一直把组织全体人员活学活用毛泽东思想，提高两条路线斗争觉悟，作为工作的根本。
    医生李子元是从卫生员成长起来的。组织上曾把他送到军医大学学习。毕业时，他想，留在学校搞研究工作，或到大医院当医生，对提高自己的技术更有利。回部队以后，仍然没有从“我”字中完全解放出来。不久，群众送来一个烧伤的患儿，他怕治不好，建议转院。为什么在需要为人民服务的节骨眼上，“私”字冒了头？党支部帮助他带着问题反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》。他用毛主席关于“毫不利己专门利人”和“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导，对照自己，狠斗了“私”字，提高了思想，主动承担了治疗任务。经过两个多月的精心护理和治疗，把烧伤患儿治好了。大家从李子元活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想的过程中深深体会到，不彻底改造资产阶级世界观，从个人出发，即使技术提高了，也不能很好地为人民服务。只有不断用毛泽东思想武装头脑，积极提高为人民服务的觉悟，才能有所创造，有所前进。
    为了在实践中进一步锤炼医务人员无限忠于毛主席的红心，几年来，这个卫生科遵照毛主席关于“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”的伟大教导，在深入连队的同时，还深入农村，参加社会主义教育运动，参加“三支”“两军”工作和巡回医疗，在惊心动魄的阶级斗争中，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟。他们派往郭村公社的医疗队就是在斗争中，得到锻炼和提高的。刘少奇及其在当地的代理人在医疗卫生战线上推行反革命修正主义路线，大砍公社卫生所，以组织“联合诊所”为名，让医务人员搞单干，鼓励他们走资本主义道路，给农村的卫生保健事业造成了严重危害。医疗队的同志和贫下中农一起开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。贫农吴老大爷愤怒控诉：“旧社会咱们被压得血干筋骨断，多少穷人活活病死也见不到医生一面。解放了，毛主席他老人家总是惦记着贫下中农有没有医，有没有药。可是，刘少奇搞资本主义复辟，弄得农村缺医少药，这不是叫咱们回到过去的年月嘛！”贫下中农对大叛徒刘少奇的愤怒控诉，使医疗队的同志受到了深刻的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，他们以积极帮助公社发展医疗卫生事业的实际行动，投入捍卫毛主席革命路线的伟大斗争。他们看到公社卫生所不能做一般外科手术，社员有病就得往城里跑，耽误革命和生产，就帮助卫生所因陋就简，建立了小手术室。两个多月，他们和公社卫生人员一道为贫下中农做了阑尾、疝气等一百多例，无一感染。贫下中农称赞说：“你们动的小手术，走的大方向，处处为贫下中农着想，执行的是毛主席的革命路线。”
    现在，卫生科的同志们正积极投入学习两条路线斗争史的学习运动，决心在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报指引下，用毛主席在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装头脑，在阶级斗争的风浪里，在接近工农兵群众的过程中，活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，使自己的一生成为永远忠于毛主席革命路线的一生，永远为人民服务的一生，不断为人民立新功。
