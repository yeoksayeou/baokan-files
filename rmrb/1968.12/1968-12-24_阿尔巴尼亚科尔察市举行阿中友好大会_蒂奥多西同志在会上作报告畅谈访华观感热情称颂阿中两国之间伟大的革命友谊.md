Everywhere we went, we saw the great and heroic Chinese people, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, displaying a high revolutionary spirit in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Comrade Theodhosi also discussed the important resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the unshakable determination of the Chinese people to implement these resolutions, and the glorious achievements the great Chinese people are making under the personal leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong in the fields of science, technology, economy, and agriculture.
