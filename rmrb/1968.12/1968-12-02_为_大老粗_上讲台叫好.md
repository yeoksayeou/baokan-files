Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on "realizing the proletarian education revolution, which must be led by the working class and must have the participation of the working masses," the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have marched into primary, secondary, and higher education institutions, breaking the monopoly of intellectuals. This is a great event of the 1960s! Those previously ridiculed as "illiterate" — workers and poor and lower-middle peasants — have taken to the lecture platform and begun teaching. This is an unprecedented event and a glorious page in the history of proletarian education. We wholeheartedly cheer for the "rough and ready" on the lecture platform and enthusiastically support this revolutionary new thing full of vitality.

The "rough and ready" on the lecture platform are good because they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics everywhere, passionately propagating, resolutely implementing, and bravely defending Chairman Mao's series of latest directives. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They have thoroughly criticized the rotten bourgeois ideology of "mastering mathematics, physics, and chemistry to go anywhere without fear" and turned the "utopia" into a bastion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The "rough and ready" on the lecture platform are good because they best implement Chairman Mao's personally advocated revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, making education serve proletarian politics and integrate with productive labor. Students learn and apply what they learn in the three great revolutionary movements, turning past empty talk and empty thinking into learning while doing, and changing observing instruments and specimens into operating machines and planting crops. Students have clear learning objectives, learn quickly, understand thoroughly, and can apply what they learn.

The "rough and ready" on the lecture platform are good because they always emphasize class education and revolutionary criticism, fundamentally raising students' awareness of class struggle and line struggle, making students forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Students educated in this way are trusted and relied upon by the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants.

Batch after batch of "rough and ready" with rich practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements have taken to the lecture platform, teaching alongside revolutionary teachers, fighting shoulder to shoulder, and educating them, thus strengthening the teaching force and changing its composition. These "rough and ready" have made a solemn vow:

"Chairman Mao asks us to take charge, and we are not afraid of any difficulties. This lecture platform, we have occupied it!" This fully shows the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants' loyalty to Chairman Mao and their heroic spirit of carrying the proletarian education revolution through to the end. All revolutionary comrades should enthusiastically support this new thing and not point fingers or pick faults. A handful of class enemies who are unwilling to die will meet a bloody end if they dare to sabotage our "rough and ready" occupying the lecture platform.

    为“大老粗”上讲台叫好
    在伟大领袖毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的最新指示指引下，工人毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡地开进大、中、小学，打破了知识分子独霸的一统天下。这是二十世纪六十年代的伟大事件！过去被人讥笑为“斗大字不识半升”的“大老粗”——工人、贫下中农登上讲台，开口讲课，这是亘古未有的大事，是无产阶级教育史上光辉的一页。我们就是要为“大老粗”上讲台大声叫好，为这个充满生命力的革命新事物鸣锣开道。
      “大老粗”上讲台，好就好在他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，处处突出无产阶级政治，热情宣传、坚决贯彻、勇敢捍卫毛主席的一系列最新指示，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。他们把什么“学会数理化，走遍天下都不怕”等等腐朽透顶的资产阶级思想，批得臭不可闻，把“世外桃源”变成了宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
      “大老粗”上讲台，好就好在他们最能贯彻毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，使教育紧紧地为无产阶级政治服务，同生产劳动相结合。使学生在三大革命运动中学，在三大革命运动中用，把过去的空讲、空想变成了边学边干，把看仪器、看标本，换成开机器、种庄稼，学生学习目的明确，学得快，学得懂，用得上。
      “大老粗”上讲台，好就好在他们始终狠抓阶级教育，狠抓革命大批判，从根本上提高学生的阶级斗争、路线斗争觉悟，使学生永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这样培养出来的人，工人阶级、贫下中农敢使用，信得过。
      一批批富有三大革命运动实践经验的“大老粗”，陆续登上讲台，和广大革命教师一起讲课，并肩战斗，同时对他们进行再教育，壮大了教师队伍，改变了教师队伍的成份。这些“大老粗”发出了惊天动地的誓言：
  “毛主席叫我们作主，有天大困难也不怕，这个讲台，我们是占定了！”充分表现出工人阶级、贫下中农对毛主席的赤胆忠心，表现出把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的英雄气概。一切革命的同志，都应该满腔热情地支持这个新生事物，而不要指手划脚，百般挑剔。一小撮不甘心死亡的阶级敌人，如果胆敢破坏我们“大老粗”占领讲台，就叫它碰个头破血流。石家庄市驻三中工人毛泽东思想宣传队
