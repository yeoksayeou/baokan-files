The Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have been waging a heroic and tenacious struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, achieving great victories on the battlefield. With the tacit support and connivance of the modern revisionist traitor clique, the U.S. imperialists have been resorting to the two counter-revolutionary tactics of military adventurism and political deception in their desperate struggles. The Vietnamese people and their army will see through the enemy's tricks and deceits.

New China News Agency, December 21. Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Lin Biao, today cabled Comrade Vo Nguyen Giap, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to extend warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army on the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army, on behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The full text of the cable is as follows:

Hanoi

Comrade Vo Nguyen Giap,
Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

Dear Comrade Minister:

On the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend our warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army.

The heroic Vietnamese people have a revolutionary tradition of opposing imperialism and colonialism. Under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people and their army, with their indomitable fighting spirit and heroic determination to "fight to the end and win the final victory," have written a glorious chapter in the long history of their revolutionary struggle against colonial rule, imperialist aggression, and for national liberation. In recent years, the Vietnamese people have been waging a heroic and tenacious struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackeys to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country, achieving great victories on the battlefield.

At present, with the tacit support and connivance of the modern revisionist traitor clique, the U.S. imperialists have been resorting to the two counter-revolutionary tactics of military adventurism and political deception in their desperate struggles. We are firmly convinced that the Vietnamese people and their army, tempered by long years of revolutionary struggle, will see through the enemy's tricks and deceits. The heroic Vietnamese people, with their hearts united and their hatred for the enemy, will persist in protracted warfare and will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and win final victory in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation!

The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army extend warm support to and sincerely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Chairman Mao has said: "The 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will surely follow Chairman Mao's teaching and firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying their war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end!

Down with U.S. imperialism!

Victory to the Vietnamese people!

Long live the firm fighting friendship between the peoples and the armies of China and Vietnam!

    河内
    越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将
    尊敬的部长同志：
    在越南人民军建军二十四周年的时候，我代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军全体战友，致以最热烈的节日祝贺！
    英勇的越南人民有着反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的革命传统。越南人民及其军队，在胡志明主席的领导下，以坚强的战斗意志和“决战决胜”的英雄气概，在反对殖民主义统治，反对帝国主义侵略，争取民族解放的长期革命斗争中，写下了光荣的历史。近几年来，越南人民为了解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国，同美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，在战场上赢得了伟大的胜利。
    目前，美帝国主义在现代修正主义叛徒集团的默契和支持下，交替使用军事冒险和政治欺骗的反革命两手策略，进行垂死的挣扎。我们坚信，经过长期革命斗争锻炼的越南人民及其军队是会识破敌人的阴谋诡计的。英勇的越南人民，南北一心，同仇敌忾，坚持持久战争，一定能够彻底打败美国侵略强盗，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利！
    中国人民和中国人民解放军，热情援助并真诚支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。毛主席说：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定遵照毛主席的这一教导，坚决支持英勇的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    美帝国主义必败！
    越南人民必胜！
    中越两国人民和两国军队的坚强的战斗友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国国务院
    副总理兼国防部长  林彪
