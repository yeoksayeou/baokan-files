The Italian workers' movement against the exploitation and oppression of monopoly capital and for improved living and working conditions continues to surge. Waves of strikes, demonstrations, and factory occupations are sweeping across the country.

In Genoa, northern Italy, 65,000 metalworkers and machine manufacturers went on a 24-hour strike on November 29. Thousands of strikers, supported by hundreds of students, held a massive demonstration in the city center, protesting against the monopoly capitalists' arbitrary layoffs and demanding wage increases and improved working conditions.

Workers at sugar factories across Italy went on strike on November 29 and 30 to protest against the "Eridania" sugar company's layoffs of 400 workers and threats to lay off thousands more. In Ferrara, workers and agricultural laborers from various industries joined forces for a general strike in support of the sugar workers' struggle.

Canned food workers across Italy have also been on strike for 48 hours in the past two days. They had previously gone on a 24-hour strike on November 26.

Mail guards went on a nationwide strike on November 27 and 28 to demand wage increases and reduced working hours, causing large amounts of mail to pile up at train stations and be unable to be shipped.

Meanwhile, the strike wave has spread to the "Pirelli" rubber trust's factories. Rubber workers are angrily protesting the capitalists' refusal to meet their demands for wage increases. Workers at "Pirelli" factories in Milan and Turin went on strike on November 27. Workers at other "Pirelli" trust factories are also conducting intermittent strikes.

In Palermo, the capital of Sicily in southern Italy, more than 1,000 metalworkers and machine manufacturers held a demonstration on November 26, protesting against the monopoly capitalists' brutal exploitation and demanding wage increases. The reactionary authorities sent police to brutally attack the demonstrators. The workers bravely fought back with fists and stones. In the province of Syracuse in Sicily, 30,000 agricultural workers went on strike for five days to demand wage increases.

In the capital, Rome, 300 workers occupied the "Apollo" printing factory, protesting against the capitalists' closure of the factory. Their struggle has lasted for six months and is still ongoing. Additionally, 100 young female workers have occupied their knitting factory for over a month. Due to their resolute struggle, they have withstood the police's attempts to evict them from the factory.

    新华社一日讯　罗马消息：意大利广大工人反对垄断资本的剥削和压迫，争取改善生活和劳动条件的群众运动正在继续高涨。罢工、示威游行和占领工厂的斗争浪潮此伏彼起，席卷意大利全国各地。
    在意大利北部的热那亚，六万五金和机器制造工人十一月二十九日举行二十四小时罢工。数以千计的罢工者在几百名学生的声援下，在市中心举行了声势浩大的示威，反对垄断资本家无理解雇工人，要求提高工资和改善劳动条件。
    意大利全国制糖厂的工人十一月二十九日和三十日一致举行罢工，抗议垄断企业“埃里达尼亚”糖业公司解雇四百名工人并威胁还要解雇数千名工人。在费拉拉市，各行业的工人和农业劳动者联合举行总罢工，支持制糖工人的斗争。
    意大利全国的罐头食品工人这两天也举行了四十八小时罢工。他们曾经在十一月二十六日举行过二十四小时罢工。
    邮车押运员为要求提高工资和缩短工时，在十一月二十七日和二十八日举行了全国性的罢工，使得大批邮件堆积在火车站上，无法起运。
    与此同时，罢工浪潮波及“皮雷利”橡胶托辣斯所属工厂。橡胶工人愤怒抗议资本家顽固拒绝工人们提出的增加工资的要求。在米兰和都灵的“皮雷利”工厂的工人，十一月二十七日举行了罢工。
  “皮雷利”托辣斯的其他工厂的工人也正在进行间歇性的罢工。
    在意大利南部西西里区的首府巴勒莫，一千多名五金和机器制造工人十一月二十六日举行了示威游行，反对垄断资本残酷剥削，要求增加工资。反动当局出动警察野蛮袭击示威工人。工人们用拳头和石块英勇地进行了反击。在西西里区的锡拉库扎省，三万农业工人为要求提高工资举行了五天的罢工。
    在首都罗马，三百名工人占领“阿波隆”印刷厂，反对资本家关闭工厂。他们的斗争至今已达六个月，现在仍在坚持斗争中。此外，一百名青年女工占领她们工作的针织厂已达一个多月，由于她们坚决斗争，顶住了警察想把她们赶出工厂的企图。
