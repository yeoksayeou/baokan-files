The revolutionary masses of Henan Province, with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and his report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee. They have deeply launched a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, sparking a new high tide in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. This has powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Over the past few days, the revolutionary committees at various levels in Henan Province have dispatched hundreds of thousands of propaganda teams, mainly composed of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directive and his report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee. The entire province is engaged in studying the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines. From the province, prefecture, and county levels down to the people's communes, production brigades, and even to the homes of commune members, countless Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established, focusing on the history of the struggle between the two lines. The number of participants in these study classes has reached over 40 million. In these classes, the revolutionary masses have linked the facts of the struggle between the two lines in their local areas with the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement. They have seriously studied the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines within the party over the past forty years, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They deeply feel that following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory! The more they study, the more they love Chairman Mao, the more they love Mao Zedong Thought, and the more they love Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This has led to an unprecedented spread of Mao Zedong Thought and a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line among the people.

The outstanding feature of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in Henan Province is to carry forward the revolutionary study style of closely combining theory with practice, as personally advocated by the great leader Chairman Mao. They insist on learning in struggle, using in struggle, learning in criticism, using in criticism, learning in reform, and using in reform. In industrial areas like Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Hebi, the revolutionary workers have, in conjunction with the actual struggle between the two lines in their factories, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to severely criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents who fervently promoted the revisionist line of "expert management," "material incentives," and "technical leadership" in their factories. The revolutionary workers of the Dongfeng Tractor Factory in Luoyang said, "Following Chairman Mao's great teaching of 'relying wholeheartedly on the working class,' we have displayed a daring spirit of innovation and, in the great leap year of 1958, achieved over 3,400 technical innovations, producing a large number of tractors for the motherland. The traitor Liu Shaoqi came to our factory in 1960 and peddled the revisionist goods of 'expert management,' slandering our technical innovations as 'subjectivism' and forcibly cutting down our innovation projects, directly affecting tractor production. Through the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers of this factory have firmly grasped Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist management line. They have established a 'technical reform experimental station' with the working class as the main body, including revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel, and launched a magnificent movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. In a short period, the tractor production has exceeded the highest production level since the factory was established."

In the vast rural areas, everywhere is a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and everywhere is a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. The poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have severely criticized the revisionist goods of "self-reliance, self-management, self-sufficiency," "four freedoms," and "work points as the key" promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents.

The new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the cities and countryside of Henan Province has powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation and the leap in production and construction.

    河南省广大革命群众通过深入学习两条路线斗争史
    掀起活学活用毛泽东思想新高潮
    以毛泽东思想为武器，联系实际，狠狠批判叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货
    据新华社郑州十日电 河南省五千万革命人民，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，认真学习了毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动新高潮，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    十几天来，河南省各级革命委员会派出了数百万人的以工人和贫下中农为主体的毛泽东思想宣传队，向广大革命群众宣传毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告。全省到处都在学习两条路线斗争的历史经验。从省、地、县到人民公社、生产队以至社员家庭，办起了数以万计的以学习两条路线斗争史为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。全省参加学习班的人数已达四千多万人次。在学习班里，广大革命群众联系本地两条路线斗争的事实，结合斗、批、改运动，认真学习了四十多年来特别是无产阶级文化大革命中党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，深深感到：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！他们越学越热爱毛主席，越学越热爱毛泽东思想，越学越热爱毛主席的革命路线，从而使毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心。
    河南省广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的突出特点是：发扬伟大领袖毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，坚持在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在批判中学，在批判中用，在改革中学，在改革中用。产业工人比较集中的郑州、洛阳、平顶山、焦作、鹤壁等地，广大革命职工结合本厂两条路线斗争的实际，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为强大武器，狠批了叛徒刘少奇及其在本厂的代理人疯狂推行
  “专家治厂”、“物质刺激”、“技术挂帅”等反革命修正主义办企业路线。洛阳东方红拖拉机厂的广大革命职工说，我们遵照毛主席“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”的伟大教导，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，在大跃进的一九五八年实现了三千四百多项技术革新，为祖国生产了大批拖拉机。叛徒刘少奇在一九六○年来到我们厂，大肆贩卖“专家治厂”的修正主义黑货，诬蔑我们的技术革新是“唯心主义”，硬把我们的革新项目砍掉，直接影响了拖拉机的生产。通过革命大批判，这个厂的广大革命职工牢牢地掌握了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把刘少奇的修正主义办厂路线批得臭不可闻。他们遵照毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的教导，建立了以工人阶级为主体的、有革命干部和革命技术人员参加的三结合“技术改革试验站”，开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动，在短短的时间内，拖拉机的产量超过了建厂以来的最高生产水平。
    在广大农村，到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，到处是斗私批修的战场。广大贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，对刘少奇及其代理人推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，进行了狠狠的批判。
    河南省城乡活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动新高潮的出现，有力地推动着斗、批、改的深入发展和生产建设的飞跃。
