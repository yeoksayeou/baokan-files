	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, our correspondent reports: In recent times, U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, has been vigorously peddling the notorious so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem, attempting to lure Arab countries into submission and butchery. This has sparked a new wave of anti-U.S. struggle among the Arab people. The Arab people are determined to bravely fight back against the evil U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, and to thoroughly smash their plots of military threats and political inducements to surrender.

	Through long-term struggle, the Arab people have deeply felt that U.S. imperialism is their number one enemy.

	It is precisely U.S. imperialism, in close collaboration with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, that during this session of the United Nations, has been playing a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy: On the one hand, U.S. imperialism has been peddling the so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem, strongly supporting Israel's recently proposed "nine-point plan," which is essentially a plan to lure Arab countries into complete surrender. It has also actively plotted and arranged for "negotiations" between Arab countries and Israel, either directly or indirectly, under the auspices of the United Nations, to force Arab countries to recognize the existence of the "State of Israel," accept the conditions proposed by the Israeli aggressors, and allow its other tool of aggression, the United Nations, to intervene in Arab affairs. On the other hand, U.S. imperialism has openly announced its agreement to provide Israel with U.S. "Phantom" jet fighter-bombers and has instructed Israel to intensify military provocations against the surrounding Arab countries, continuing to exert military pressure.

	Facing the various conspiracies of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, the Arab people have risen up to wage even more courageous struggles. On the battlefield of armed struggle, the brave Palestinian guerrillas have intensified their attacks, striking the enemy even more heavily and achieving new victories. From early October to mid-November, the Palestinian guerrillas launched approximately 260 attacks, killing and wounding more than 1,600 Israeli aggressors. The frequency of their attacks and the number of enemies they have eliminated have both increased significantly compared to the past, and their targets are mostly the political, military, and economic key departments of Israel, including two surprise raids on Israel's largest airport, Lod Airport. Both raids caused massive fires, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The frequent attacks by the Palestinian guerrillas have left the fully U.S.-equipped Israeli aggressors in a state of confusion and panic, greatly boosting the morale of the Arab people and crushing the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and Israel.

	Under the instructions and support of U.S. imperialism, Israel has recently concentrated large numbers of troops in the areas it occupies on the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Sinai Peninsula of the United Arab Republic, and the Golan Heights of Syria, and has repeatedly launched new military provocations against the United Arab Republic, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. The military and civilians of these Arab countries, filled with new and old grievances, have risen up to counterattack, inflicting heavy punishment on the Israeli aggressors. Since late October, the United Arab Republic's army has shot down four Israeli planes and damaged one in two counterattacks.

	On another front, for more than a month, the wave of anti-U.S. demonstrations by the Arab masses has surged and risen, one after another. In the areas of the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip under Israeli occupation, the Palestinian people there are even more indignant, holding demonstrations, general strikes, school strikes, and market closures, or distributing leaflets opposing Israeli occupation. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Get out, Israeli aggressors," "Palestine belongs to the Arabs," "We support armed struggle and the Palestinian commando units," and so on. The Israeli occupation authorities, in a state of panic, sent out large numbers of soldiers and police to carry out savage repression. However, the unyielding Palestinian demonstrators fought back with stones, sticks, bottles, and boiling oil, and some even fought hand-to-hand with the enemy barehanded. These strikes and demonstrations, in coordination with the activities of the Palestinian guerrillas, have powerfully struck the Israeli aggressors.

	On November 2, large-scale anti-U.S. demonstrations erupted in various Arab countries. Workers, peasants, and students in Syria, Iraq, the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Jordan, and Lebanon held massive protest meetings and demonstrations, angrily denouncing U.S. imperialism's recognition of the pro-Zionist _Balfour Declaration_ more than fifty years ago and its repeated support for Zionist aggressors in Israel over the past twenty years in invading Arab countries. The demonstrators shouted slogans in the streets such as "Down with U.S. imperialism," "Oppose 'peaceful solution,'" "Fully support the armed revolution of the Palestinian people," and "People's war is the only way to liberate our occupied lands."

	The Arab people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is continuing to develop and will receive increasingly broad support from the people of all countries in the world. The "Fatah" (Palestine National Liberation Movement), which is bravely fighting for the liberation of Palestine, solemnly declared: "We firmly reject and oppose all proposals, including the so-called 'peaceful solution' methods proposed in the United Nations, the 'resolution' of the Security Council on November 22 last year, the mission of the United Nations 'special envoy' Jarin, and all other suggestions that trade with the rights of the Palestinian people."

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The oppressed peoples and nations can never rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." There is no doubt that as long as the people of various Arab countries strengthen their unity and persist in waging a protracted people's war, no matter what difficulties and obstacles lie ahead, they will surely smash the evil plots of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists to butcher the Arab people, and will certainly defeat the externally strong but internally weak paper tiger—U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel—to achieve the final victory.

    反对“政治解决”中东问题骗局　不怕美帝以色列的军事威胁
    阿拉伯人民反美斗争浪潮汹涌澎湃
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：最近以来，美帝国主义伙同苏修叛徒集团，加紧兜售臭名昭著的所谓“政治解决”中东问题的骗局，企图诱迫阿拉伯国家屈膝投降，任凭宰割。这激起了阿拉伯人民反美斗争的新高涨。阿拉伯人民决心以更英勇的战斗，迎头痛击万恶的美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列，彻底粉碎他们玩弄的军事威胁和政治诱降反革命两手的阴谋诡计。
    在长期斗争中，阿拉伯人民切身体会到：美帝国主义是他们的头号敌人。
    正是美帝国主义，在苏修叛徒集团的紧密配合下，在今年这届联合国大会期间，加紧玩弄反革命两手：一方面，美帝国主义四出兜售所谓“政治解决”中东问题的骗局，大力支持以色列最近提出的实质上是诱骗阿拉伯国家全面投降的“九点计划”，并且积极策划和安排在联合国主持下的阿拉伯国家与以色列之间的直接或间接的“谈判”，来诱迫阿拉伯国家承认“以色列国”的存在，接受以色列侵略者提出的条件，以及让它的另一侵略工具联合国插手阿拉伯事务；另一方面，美帝国主义公然宣布答应向以色列提供美国“鬼怪式”喷气战斗轰炸机，并且指使以色列加紧对周围的阿拉伯国家发动新的军事挑衅，继续施加军事压力。
    面对美帝、苏修以上种种阴谋诡计，阿拉伯人民奋起开展更加英勇的斗争。在武装斗争战场上，英勇的巴勒斯坦游击队加紧出击，更沉重地打击了敌人，连连取得新的胜利。从十月初到十一月中旬，巴勒斯坦游击队发动了大约二百六十次袭击，共打死打伤一千六百多名以色列侵略军。他们出击的次数和歼敌的数量都比过去大大增加，而且打击的目标多半是以色列的政治、军事和经济要害部门，其中包括两次奇袭以色列最大的机场——利达机场。这两次袭击都引起熊熊大火，使敌人遭到重大损失。巴勒斯坦游击队的频繁出击，把全副美式配备的以色列侵略军打得晕头转向，惊惶失措，大长了阿拉伯人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义和以色列的威风。
    在美帝国主义的指使和支持下，以色列最近在其占领下的约旦河西岸、阿联西奈半岛和叙利亚戈兰高地集结大量军队，并且一再向阿联、叙利亚、约旦和黎巴嫩进行新的军事挑衅。这些阿拉伯国家的军民，满怀新仇旧恨，奋起反击，给以色列侵略者以沉重的惩罚。十月下旬以来，阿联军队在两次反击中，击落四架以色列飞机，击伤一架。
    在另一条战线上，一个多月来，阿拉伯群众的反美示威浪潮，汹涌澎湃，此伏彼起。在以色列占领下的约旦河西岸和加沙地带，那里的巴勒斯坦人民，群情更加激昂，纷纷举行示威游行，总罢工，总罢课，总罢市，或散发反对以色列占领的传单。示威者高呼“以色列侵略者滚出去”、“巴勒斯坦属于阿拉伯人”、“我们支持武装斗争和巴勒斯坦突击队”等口号。以色列占领当局惊恐万状，出动大批军警进行疯狂镇压。但是，不畏强暴的巴勒斯坦示威者，用石头、木棒、瓶子以及烧开了的菜油进行反击，甚至有的人赤手空拳，同敌人展开肉搏。这些罢工和示威游行同巴勒斯坦游击队的活动相互呼应，相互配合，有力地打击了以色列侵略者。
    十一月二日，阿拉伯各国爆发大规模的反美示威。叙利亚、伊拉克、阿联、苏丹、约旦和黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家的工人、农民和学生举行声势浩大的抗议集会和示威游行，愤怒谴责美帝国主义远在五十年前就承认了支持犹太复国主义的《贝尔福宣言》以及它近二十年来一再支持以色列犹太复国主义者侵略阿拉伯国家的滔天罪行。示威者在大街上振臂高喊“打倒美帝国主义”、“反对‘和平解决’”、“完全支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装革命”和“人民战争是我们解放被占领的土地的唯一道路”等口号。
    阿拉伯人民反美斗争还正在继续向前发展，并将得到全世界各国人民越来越广泛的支持。为巴勒斯坦解放而进行英勇斗争的“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）庄严宣布：“联合国中提出的所谓‘和平解决’方法，安全理事会去年十一月二十二日的‘决议’和联合国‘特使’雅林的使命以及拿巴勒斯坦人民的权利做交易的其他一切建议，我们都坚决拒绝，坚决反对。”
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早已指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”毫无疑义，只要阿拉伯各国人民加强团结，坚持进行持久的人民战争，不管前进道路上有什么困难险阻，他们定将彻底粉碎美帝、苏修企图宰割阿拉伯人民的罪恶阴谋，必将打败外强中干的纸老虎——美帝国主义及其走狗以色列，取得最后的胜利。
