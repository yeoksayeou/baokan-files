On the evening of the 21st, Assistant Engineer of the Nanjing Military Region Engineering Corps, Tian Fangyou, heard from the radio the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. His heart was filled with immense excitement. He and his wife Wang Zhenqi repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and wrote a letter that night to their daughter, who had gone to the front lines of agricultural production two months earlier, sharing their insights and experiences from studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. They encouraged their daughter to follow the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao to the end.

Two months ago, Tian Fangyou's eldest daughter, Tian Yuyu, graduated from junior high school. He and his wife discussed sending their daughter to the countryside to settle down. However, his wife had some reservations, thinking that since both husband and wife had jobs, there were many children, and the household chores were heavy, everything inside and outside the home now relied on Yuyu. If she left, it would be like losing an arm, and there would be no one to help with the household chores. Tian Fangyou noticed his wife's reservations and discussed with her Chairman Mao's teachings: "The dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually do unite with the workers and peasants." Husband and wife studied and discussed together. Tian Fangyou said, if our children stay at home all the time, not experiencing the storms of class struggle and seeing the great scenes of class struggle, this way they might become revisionists! Sending children to the countryside for tempering and transformation is a big issue in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the next generation. Mao Zedong Thought illuminated his wife's heart, and she also expressed that she could not bind the children with "selfishness." The couple made up their minds to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and send their daughter to the countryside.

Next, the couple studied Chairman Mao's latest directive with their daughter, engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of reading books to become officials," raising their daughter's awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Yuyu happily expressed her willingness to resolutely rush to the front lines of agricultural production, go to the countryside, and receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

Should the daughter go to the relatively good conditions of Southern Jiangsu or to the relatively poor conditions of Northern Jiangsu? Tian Fangyou's wife had her own considerations. She thought: Old Tian's hometown is in Southern Jiangsu, which is a land of fish and rice. Sending the daughter there would have better living conditions, and there would be relatives to take care of her. Tian Fangyou saw through his wife's calculations. He thought: cultivating revolutionary successors cannot be done in a greenhouse. Tempering oneself in hardship, the more difficult the place, the more it can temper a person. Although there is only one character difference between the south and the north, it reflects the struggle between the two lines in one's mind. Therefore, he convened a family meeting to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, using his own family history to conduct vivid class education. In old society, Tian Fangyou's father was a cowherd and a farmhand for the landlord from a young age. Seeing that six children were struggling to survive from hunger, he first had to sell Tian Fangyou's four-year-old sister, and later sent Tian Fangyou and his two brothers to others. It was not until after liberation that the family was reunited. Tian Fangyou's family history of blood and tears aroused the family's deep hatred for the old society and the top capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi, and further inspired their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Tian Fangyou's wife once again criticized her "selfishness." She stood up and said, sending educated youth to the countryside is for revolution! Revolution requires hard struggle. I support Yuyu settling down in the countryside of Northern Jiangsu. Yuyu, moved by her father's recollections, could not help but shed tears. She said, the top capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, poisons us to look down on labor, look down on workers and peasants, and wants to lead us down the path of restoring capitalism. We will not fall for his tricks! She immediately expressed to the whole family that she would resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, settle down in a difficult place, root herself in the countryside for life, receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants for life, and wholeheartedly build a new socialist countryside.

On the evening before Yuyu's departure, the Tian family held a family farewell meeting in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Tian Fangyou gave his daughter a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and Mao's brilliant works "Old Five Articles," and hung a shining Mao badge on his daughter's chest, hoping she would march forward on the revolutionary journey guided by the great leader Chairman Mao! The mother also repeatedly admonished Yuyu to always be loyal to Chairman Mao and always walk the broad path of uniting with workers and peasants.

Now, Yuyu's thoughts are tempered redder and her body is stronger in the vast countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants all praise her as a countryside girl.

    送女下乡记
    二十一日晚上，南京部队工程兵某部助理员田方有，从广播里听到了伟大领袖毛主席发出的知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育的最新指示，心情无比激动。他和爱人王振卿反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，连夜给两个月前奔向农业生产第一线的女儿写了一封信，介绍了他们学习毛主席这一最新指示的心得体会，勉励女儿要沿着毛主席指引的革命大道走到底。
    两个月前，田方有的大女儿田蕴玉初中毕业了，他和爱人商量把女儿送到农村去落户。但是，他爱人有个活思想，觉得夫妻俩都有工作，孩子多，家务重，里里外外现在全靠着蕴玉，她一走，就象缺了一只胳膊，家务事没有个帮手了。田方有发现他爱人有这个活思想，就和爱人一起学习毛主席的教导：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”夫妻俩边学习、边议论。田方有说，咱家的孩子老待在家里，不去经阶级斗争的大风雨，见阶级斗争的大世面，这样下去可要变修啊！让孩子到农村去锻炼改造，这是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺下一代的大问题。毛泽东思想照亮了田方有爱人的心，她也表示，不能用“私”字捆住孩子。夫妻俩下了决心，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，把女儿送到农村去。
    接着，夫妻俩又和女儿一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起斗私批修，批判刘少奇的“读书做官论”，提高了女儿的路线斗争觉悟。蕴玉愉快地表示坚决奔向农业生产第一线，到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。
    让女儿到条件好的苏南还是到条件差的苏北去？田方有的爱人又有自己的考虑。她想：老田的故乡是在苏南，那里是鱼米之乡，把女儿送到那里去，生活条件好些，还有亲人给照顾。田方有看出了爱人的小算盘，他想：培养革命后代，不能在温室里培养。艰苦炼红心，越是艰苦的地方，越是能锻炼人。一南一北，虽然只有一字之差，却是两条路线斗争在头脑里的反映。于是，他召集全家开了一次活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，用自己的家史进行活生生的阶级教育。在旧社会，田方有的父亲从小给地主放牛、当长工，眼看六个孩子在饥饿中挣扎不下去了，先是被迫把田方有四岁的妹妹卖了，后来又把田方有弟兄三人送给了别人。直到解放后，一家人才重新团聚。田方有血泪斑斑的家史，激起了全家人对旧社会、对党内头号走资派刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，更激发了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。田方有的爱人又一次斗掉了“私”字，她站起来说，知识青年到农村去，是为了干革命！干革命就要艰苦奋斗，我赞成蕴玉到苏北农村去安家落户。蕴玉听了爸爸的忆苦，情不自禁地流下了眼泪。她说，党内头号走资派刘少奇的修正主义教育路线毒害我们轻视劳动，轻视工农，想把我们引到复辟资本主义的邪路上去，我们决不上他的当！她当场向全家表示，坚决听毛主席的话，到艰苦的地方去安家落户，一辈子扎根在农村，一辈子接受贫下中农的再教育，全心全意建设社会主义的新农村。
    蕴玉临行的前一天晚上，田方有全家在毛主席像前开了一个家庭欢送会。田方有把一套《毛泽东选集》和毛主席的光辉著作“老五篇”送给女儿，又把一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章挂在女儿胸前，希望她在伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命征途上阔步前进！母亲也千叮咛万嘱咐，要蕴玉永远忠于毛主席，永远走与工农相结合的康庄大道。
    现在，蕴玉在农村这个广阔天地里，思想越炼越红，身体也越来越壮，贫下中农都夸她象个农村姑娘了。
