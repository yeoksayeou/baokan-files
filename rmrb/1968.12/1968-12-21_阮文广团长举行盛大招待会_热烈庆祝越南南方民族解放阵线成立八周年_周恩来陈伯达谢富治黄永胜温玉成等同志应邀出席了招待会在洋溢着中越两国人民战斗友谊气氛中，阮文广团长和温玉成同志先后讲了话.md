Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, head of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front’s permanent delegation to China, held a grand reception on the evening of December 20 to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front. Comrade Vu Minh Quan, Vietnamese ambassador to China, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing attended the reception.

Leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and other departments, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, and Wen Yucheng, as well as Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, were invited to attend the reception.

The reception began with the orchestra playing the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's song "Liberate the South."

In the atmosphere of warm camaraderie between the peoples of China and Vietnam, Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu and Comrade Wen Yucheng delivered speeches.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, in his speech, expounded on the great historical significance of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's birth in the struggle, introduced the glorious victories achieved by the military and people of Vietnam South under the leadership of the National Liberation Front in the anti-American national salvation war, and the great achievements made in expanding the national united front and consolidating and expanding the liberated areas. He said that on the international stage, the prestige of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front continues to rise. The world's people have recognized the Vietnam South National Liberation Front as the true representative of the people of Vietnam South.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu pointed out that while the U.S. imperialists have suffered heavy defeats in their aggression against Vietnam, they have not abandoned their ambitions to invade Vietnam. They continue to stubbornly intensify the war in Vietnam South, tightly grip the Saigon puppet regime—the tool of U.S. imperialist aggression—and attempt to maintain their neo-colonialist rule in Vietnam South, to perpetually divide the Vietnamese motherland, and to continue their actions that infringe upon the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

He said that the struggle of the people of Vietnam South against the American aggressors is their inalienable right. As long as U.S. imperialism continues to invade Vietnam South, the people of Vietnam South will continue to fight until they achieve complete victory. The people of Vietnam South are aware of their glorious international duty. To not disappoint the enthusiastic support and trust of their brothers and friends around the world, they are determined to fight and defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors, no matter how arduous and sacrificial the struggle may be, for the rights of their nation and the revolutionary cause of the world's people.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu said that the fraternal Chinese people have always spared no effort to support the struggle of the people of Vietnam South. The Chinese people not only support the revolutionary line of struggle of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front and the fighting determination of the people of Vietnam South to resist U.S. imperialist aggression, but also provide sincere, substantial, and highly effective material support for the just struggle of the people of Vietnam South. The great leader of the Chinese people and the respected friend of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Mao, has said: "The fraternal people of Vietnam South and all the Vietnamese people can be assured that your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." On December 19, 1968, the respected Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou sent a congratulatory telegram to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front, on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front, reaffirming: "Seven hundred million Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end." The fraternal Chinese people, in implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, spare no effort to support the Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation struggle. The people of Vietnam South highly value this precious support and believe that every victory they achieve is inseparable from this sincere support.

He said that the people of Vietnam South have always been concerned about the glorious achievements made by the Chinese people in their own revolutionary cause and are very happy about it. The people of Vietnam South extend warm congratulations to the many great victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu said that the failure of U.S. imperialism is already obvious, but it remains stubborn and cunning. It talks about "peace" but does not give up its ambitions to invade Vietnam. The struggle of the people of Vietnam South is still very arduous and fierce. The military and people of Vietnam South enthusiastically respond to the sacred call of Chairman Hu and the Central Committee of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front, determined to unite with their seventeen million compatriots in the North, to fight with the momentum of continuous attacks and continuous uprisings, to defeat the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, to overthrow the traitorous clique, to seize all power back into the hands of the people, to gloriously fulfill the sacred mission of liberating the South, defending the North, and then peacefully reunifying the motherland, and to contribute to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

Comrade Wen Yucheng, in his speech, pointed out that the Vietnam South National Liberation Front was born in the revolutionary tide of the people of Vietnam South resisting the suppression and massacre of the U.S. and its puppet clique, and grew and strengthened in the people's war against the U.S. aggressors. The Vietnam South National Liberation Front is the glorious organizer and leader of the people of Vietnam South in the anti-American national salvation war.

He warmly praised the military and people of Vietnam South for, with the strong support of their compatriots in the North, persevering in the people's war and achieving great victories in the anti-American national salvation war. He said that the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people have laid the foundation for finally defeating U.S. imperialism, liberating the South, defending the North, and then reunifying the motherland. The Vietnamese people have tied down more than fifty thousand U.S. aggressor troops, disrupted their counter-revolutionary global strategic deployment, and made significant contributions to the struggle of the world's revolutionary people against imperialism.

Comrade Wen Yucheng said that the U.S. imperialists' successive defeats in the South Vietnam battlefield have greatly deepened the serious political and economic crises within the United States. They are short of manpower, financially bankrupt, class contradictions are increasingly sharp, the people's revolutionary movement is surging, and the contradictions within the monopoly capitalist clique are more intense. All of this fully exposes the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam is doomed to fail. However, U.S. imperialism is not willing to accept its failure in Vietnam. In recent times, it has intensified its military adventurism and political deception, playing both revolutionary hands. On one hand, it intensifies the war of aggression against Vietnam South and continues to bomb and shell Vietnam North; on the other hand, it engages in "peace talks" conspiracies, attempting to gain from the negotiating table what it cannot gain from the battlefield, forcing the Vietnamese people to give up the anti-American national salvation war, and realizing its ambition to occupy Vietnam South and split the Vietnamese nation.

Comrade Wen Yucheng said that in carrying out its conspiracies, the U.S. has always closely collaborated with the Soviet revisionist clique. After the Soviet revisionist clique's invasion of Czechoslovakia received tacit support and approval from the U.S., it has been even more enthusiastic in serving the U.S. in the Vietnamese issue. This is a counter-revolutionary political transaction between them, colluding and competing with each other, attempting to re-divide the world. The Soviet revisionists, in collusion with the U.S., have committed heinous acts of sabotaging the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war, showing that they, like U.S. imperialism, are the most vicious enemies of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

He said that the Vietnamese people are a heroic people with a tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. We believe that the thirty-one million heroic Vietnamese people will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, smash all the conspiracies and tricks of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, follow the great call of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, "As long as there is still an aggressor on our land, we will continue to fight and drive them all out," and achieve the final victory in the anti-American national salvation war.

Comrade Wen Yucheng said that the great leader of our people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "Our two countries are neighboring countries that depend on each other. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. The fraternal people of Vietnam South and all the Vietnamese people can be assured that your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." From the day the Vietnamese people began their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own. The Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will, as always, follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

After Comrades Nguyen Van Hieu and Wen Yucheng delivered their speeches, the hosts and guests, in a warm and friendly atmosphere, repeatedly toasted to the even greater victories of the Vietnamese people in the anti-American national salvation war, to the fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China, to the health of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, to the health of Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front, and to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

Those who attended the reception also included leaders from various departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, various military services and arms, the Beijing Military Region, and the Beijing Garrison Command, such as Li Tianyou, Han Zhenji, Wang Bingzhang, Zhao Qimin, Tan Jiaxu, Wu Xianen, Chen Renqi, Yang Junsheng, Huang Zhiyong, Chen Shigang, Zhang Yixiang, and Huang Zuozhen.

Those who attended the reception also included leaders from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and relevant departments, such as Wu De, Fang Yi, Han Nianlong, Ma Wenbo, Li Qiang, Li Dongye, Liu Dayu, Ren Yuzhong, Shen Jian, and Ding Xilin.

Envoys from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

On December 20, Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, head of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front’s permanent delegation to China, held a grand reception to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front. Comrade Vu Minh Quan, Vietnamese ambassador to China, and other Vietnamese comrades attended the reception.

Leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and other departments, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, and Wen Yucheng, as well as Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, were invited to attend the reception.

    新华社二十日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，今晚举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年。越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾和在北京的其他越南同志，出席了招待会。
    中共中央、中央文革和其他方面领导同志周恩来、陈伯达、谢富治、黄永胜、温玉成，以及人大常委会副委员长郭沫若等，应邀出席了招待会。
    招待会开始时，乐队高奏中华人民共和国国歌和越南南方民族解放阵线歌曲《解放南方》。
    在洋溢着中越两国人民战斗友谊气氛的招待会上，阮文广团长和温玉成同志先后讲了话。
    阮文广团长在讲话中阐述了越南南方民族解放阵线在斗争中诞生的重大历史意义，介绍了越南南方军民在民族解放阵线的领导下，在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌胜利，在扩大民族统一战线、巩固和扩大解放区等方面所取得的重大成就。他说，在国际舞台上，越南南方民族解放阵线的威望不断获得提高。世界人民已确认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的真正代表。
    阮文广在谈到美帝在侵越战争中遭到惨重失败时指出，美帝国主义并没有放弃侵略越南的野心。它仍然顽固地强化在越南南方的战争，紧紧抓住西贡伪政权——美帝国主义的侵略工具，妄图维持它在越南南方新殖民主义的统治，长期分割越南祖国，顽固地继续进行侵犯越南民主共和国主权和安全的行动。
    他说，越南南方人民为反对美国侵略者而进行的战斗，是自己不可侵犯的权利。只要美帝国主义还侵略越南南方，越南南方人民就还继续战斗，直到取得彻底胜利。越南南方人民认清自己的光荣的国际义务，为了不辜负世界上兄弟、朋友们的充满热情的支持和信赖，愿竭尽全力，不怕艰苦牺牲，为自己的民族权利和世界人民的革命事业，决心战斗和战胜美帝国主义侵略者。
    阮文广团长说，兄弟的中国人民一贯竭尽全力支持越南南方人民的斗争。中国人民不仅支持越南南方民族解放阵线的革命斗争路线，支持越南南方人民抗击美帝国主义侵略者的战斗决心，而且在物质方面，给予越南南方人民的正义斗争以真挚、巨大和非常有效的支援。中国人民的伟大领袖、越南人民敬爱的朋友毛主席曾经说过：“兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”一九六八年十二月十九日，敬爱的毛主席、林副主席和周总理在向阮友寿主席祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年的贺电中再一次肯定：“七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底”。兄弟的中国人民落实毛主席的指示，不惜一切努力来支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。越南南方人民高度地评价这一宝贵的支持，并认为自己的每一个胜利都和这一真诚的支援是分不开的。
    他说，越南南方人民一直关注着中国人民在自己的革命事业中所取得的辉煌成就，并为此感到万分高兴。越南南方人民对兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设事业和无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的许多巨大的胜利，表示热烈的祝贺。
    阮文广团长说，美帝国主义的失败已很明显，但它仍然很顽固和狡猾。它口谈“和平”，但仍不肯放弃侵略越南的野心。越南南方人民的战斗还非常艰巨和激烈。越南南方军民热烈响应胡主席的神圣号召和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的号召，决心与自己的一千七百万越南北方骨肉同胞，团结一心，发挥连续进攻和连续奋起斗争的气势，打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，打倒越奸卖国集团，把全部政权夺回到人民手里，光荣地完成解放南方、保卫北方、进而和平统一祖国的神圣义务，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。
    温玉成同志在讲话中指出，越南南方民族解放阵线，是在越南南方人民反抗美帝及其傀儡集团的镇压和屠杀的革命怒潮中诞生的，是在抗击美国侵略者的人民战争中成长壮大的。越南南方民族解放阵线，是越南南方人民抗美救国战争的光荣的组织者和领导者。
    他热烈赞扬越南南方军民在兄弟的北方同胞的大力支援下，坚持人民战争，在抗美救国战争中取得了伟大胜利。他说，越南人民取得的伟大胜利，为最后打败美帝国主义，解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国，打下了胜利的基础。越南人民拖住了美帝五十多万侵略军，打乱了它反革命的全球战略部署，对世界革命人民反对帝国主义的斗争，作出了重大贡献。
    温玉成同志说，美帝在南越战场上的节节失败，大大加深了美国国内政治、经济的严重危机。它兵源枯竭，财政空虚，阶级矛盾日益尖锐，人民革命运动不断高涨，垄断资本集团内部的矛盾更加剧烈。所有这些，充分暴露了美帝国主义纸老虎的虚弱本质。美帝国主义侵略越南的战争是注定要失败的。但是，美帝国主义不甘心它在越南的失败。最近以来，它加紧军事冒险和政治欺骗的罪恶活动，玩弄反革命两手。它一面强化对越南南方的侵略战争，继续轰炸和炮击越南北方；一面大搞“和谈”阴谋，妄图从谈判桌上捞到它在战场上捞不到的东西，迫使越南人民放弃抗美救国战争，实现它霸占越南南方、分割越南民族的侵略野心。
    温玉成同志说，美帝在推行它的阴谋活动中，一直和苏修叛徒集团紧密配合。苏修叛徒集团侵略捷克斯洛伐克得到了美帝的默契和支持后，在越南问题上就更加卖力地为美帝效劳。这是他们互相勾结、又互相争夺、妄图重新瓜分世界的一场反革命政治交易。苏修同美帝狼狈为奸，破坏越南人民抗美救国战争的罪恶行径，说明它同美帝国主义一样，是越南人民和世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    他说，越南人民是具有反帝斗争传统的英雄人民。我们相信，三千一百万英雄的越南人民，一定能够克服前进道路上的一切困难，粉碎美帝、苏修的一切阴谋诡计，遵照越南人民伟大领袖胡志明主席“只要在我国土地上还有一个侵略者，我们就要继续战斗，把它全部赶出去”的伟大号召，夺取抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    温玉成同志说，我国人民伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”从越南人民同美帝国主义及其走狗进行战斗的第一天起，中国人民就一直把越南人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼、用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，将一如既往，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    阮文广团长和温玉成同志讲话以后，宾主在热烈友好的气氛中，一再为越南人民的抗美救国战争取得更加辉煌的胜利，为越中两国人民的战斗友谊，为越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的身体健康，为越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的身体健康，为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的身体健康，干杯。
