The Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association held a meeting on December 3rd, during which a resolution was passed to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

The resolution stated that the two most significant events in China in 1968 were the establishment of revolutionary committees in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province) and the successful convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. These two events of great revolutionary significance not only represent a great victory for the Chinese people but also a great victory for the revolutionary and progressive people of the world. The resolution pointed out that the impact of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution on the world's revolutionary people is indeed enormous, marking a great failure for imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

The resolution stated that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are advancing from victory to victory. The national liberation struggles and revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries will definitely receive strong support from the Chinese people.

The resolution concluded by expressing happiness at learning from the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that Liu Shaoqi, China's Khrushchev, has been stripped of all his positions within and outside the Party, and that the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is about to be convened. We sincerely wish the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people complete success in their glorious struggle that has profound significance for the fate of humanity.

The Chinese People's Republic's photo exhibition began on December 2nd in the Tamil-dominated area of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, and was warmly welcomed by the audience.

The Sri Lankan friend, Kathiravelupillai, presided over the opening ceremony of the exhibition. In his speech, he enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Chinese people in industry, agriculture, science, and other fields.

He said, "We should all study the achievements of the Chinese people, draw appropriate lessons from them, and apply them to the specific situation of our country's people."

In his speech, he strongly condemned the attempts by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to create a "two-China" conspiracy. He said, "As far as we are concerned, there is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. This fact must be known to all the people of our country."

Many viewers wrote in the guestbook to enthusiastically praise the success of the exhibition.

Viewer Arulandanan wrote: "This exhibition is very beneficial because it depicts the development of People's China in industry, agriculture, and other fields. What is particularly important is that it points out the necessity of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao has defended and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in China."

Viewer Sivathurai wrote: "The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are colluding to oppose China. But they cannot shake China even a bit, because the 700 million Chinese people are marching forward under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China."

Many viewers also wrote in the guestbook: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

This Chinese photo exhibition was organized by the Jaffna branch of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association, with over 300 people attending the opening ceremony.

    决议说，一九六八年在中国发生的具有历史意义的两个最重大的事件是，中国除台湾省外的二十九个省、市、自治区全部成立了革命委员会和胜利地举行了中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会。这使我们感到非常高兴和受到巨大鼓舞。这两个具有革命重大意义的事件，不仅是中国人民的伟大胜利，而且也是世界各国革命人民和进步人民的伟大胜利。决议指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命对世界人民革命的影响确实是非常巨大的，它标志着帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的大失败。
    决议说，中国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉指引下，从胜利走向胜利。世界各国人民的民族解放斗争和革命斗争一定会得到中国人民的大力支持。
    决议最后说，我们十分高兴地从中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会发表的公报中获悉，中国的赫鲁晓夫刘少奇已经被撤消党内外的一切职务，同时，中国共产党的第九次代表大会即将召开。我们衷心地祝愿中国共产党和中国人民在对于人类的命运具有深远意义的光荣斗争中完全成功。
    新华社科伦坡八日电　中华人民共和国图片展览会二日开始在锡兰泰米尔人聚居区贾夫纳举办，受到观众的热烈欢迎。

    他说：“我们大家都应该研究中国人民的成就，吸取合适的教益，以运用于我国人民的具体情况。”

    许多观众在留言簿上热情赞扬展览会的成功。
    观众阿鲁兰达南写道：“这次展览很有好处，因为它描绘了人民中国在工业、农业和其他方面的发展。尤其重要的是，它指出了毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的必要性，毛主席捍卫并巩固了中国的无产阶级专政。”
    观众塞瓦杜莱写道：“美帝和苏修正在勾结起来反华。但这动不了中国的一根毫毛，因为七亿中国人民在跟着毛主席和中国共产党前进。”

    这次中国图片展览会是锡中友协贾夫纳分会组织的，有三百多人出席了开幕式。
