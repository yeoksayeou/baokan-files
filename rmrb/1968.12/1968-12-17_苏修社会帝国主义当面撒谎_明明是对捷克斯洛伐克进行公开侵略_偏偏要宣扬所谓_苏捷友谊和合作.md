The Soviet revisionist social imperialists' propaganda machine has recently, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the signing of the "Soviet-Czechoslovak Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation Treaty," been loudly boasting about so-called "Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship."

The Soviet revisionist newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial on December 12th, shamelessly ignoring the fact that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique invaded Czechoslovakia with bayonets and brutally suppressed the Czechoslovak people. They brazenly claimed, "The Czechoslovak people can in the future continue to firmly believe that the Soviet Union is their reliable friend." This is sheer hypocrisy. This newspaper also rambled on about the so-called "principles of proletarian internationalism" and "friendship and cooperation" in Soviet-Czechoslovak relations. These lies are obviously intended to cover up the Soviet revisionist clique's plundering and enslavement of Czechoslovakia. It is noteworthy that this Soviet revisionist mouthpiece, under the guise of "continuing to strengthen the Warsaw Pact" and "joint defense," is attempting to further intensify its aggression against Czechoslovakia.

    苏修社会帝国主义当面撒谎
    明明是对捷克斯洛伐克进行公开侵略
    偏偏要宣扬所谓“苏捷友谊和合作”
    本报讯  苏修叛徒集团的宣传机器，最近借着“苏捷友好互助和战后合作条约”签订二十五周年时机，大事胡吹所谓“苏捷友好”。
    苏修《真理报》十二日发表一篇社论，公然不顾苏修叛徒集团用刺刀占领捷克斯洛伐克，镇压捷克斯洛伐克人民的血腥事实，无耻宣称“捷克斯洛伐克人民今后仍然可以毫不动摇地相信，苏联是他们的可靠的朋友”，这真是虚伪透顶。这家报纸还侈谈什么苏捷关系中的所谓“无产阶级国际主义原则”和“友谊、合作”。这种谎言显然是为了掩饰苏修集团对捷克斯洛伐克的掠夺和奴役。值得注意的是，这家苏修喉舌还以“继续加强华沙条约组织”、“共同防御”为名，企图进一步加强对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略。
