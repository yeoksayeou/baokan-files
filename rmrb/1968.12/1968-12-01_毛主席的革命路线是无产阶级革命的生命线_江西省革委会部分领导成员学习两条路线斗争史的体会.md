Under the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has mobilized the masses to launch a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. The people of Jiangxi, who are deeply loyal to Chairman Mao, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, reviewed Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and enthusiastically discussed the important editorial "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" by the Central Party newspapers and journals. They have received profound education and great encouragement, significantly raising their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. Some leading members of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently shared their experiences at a meeting to study the history of the struggle between the two lines.

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must let the masses grasp Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Cheng Shiqing said: Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee are the great guidelines for deepening the struggle between the two lines. The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the re-publication of Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee are another great strategic deployment by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. This has important significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. After more than two years of tempering by the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, which has enabled them to deeply understand the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have deeply understood that "this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Thus, they have raised the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines to a new level, more closely united around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unified in thought, step, and action, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

More than forty years ago, Chairman Mao came to Jinggangshan to establish the first revolutionary base in the country and led the Anshan workers' strike. Since then, the people of Jiangxi have been nurtured by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and have risen up to make revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, from victory to victory. The people of Jiangxi have personally experienced that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of the proletarian revolution and the red thread that guides the proletarian revolution from victory to victory. In this Cultural Revolution, the people of Jiangxi, following Chairman Mao's great teachings of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly smashed the reactionary stronghold of Liu Shaoqi's agent Fang Zhichun in Jiangxi. At present, the people of the entire province are fully launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, and implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including various cultural fields. The entire province has already sent 500,000 cadres and urban residents to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants and to carry out socialist revolution and construction in the countryside together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. With the unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, the spiritual face of the people of the entire province has undergone extremely profound and inspiring changes, and a high tide of great leaps forward in industry and agriculture is about to appear. All of this is the glorious achievement of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and it is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, when grasped by the broad revolutionary masses, will become a spiritual atomic bomb against revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, ensuring that our party and country will never change color for thousands of generations. From the day of its establishment, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has always insisted on emphasizing the education of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, making Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and better grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. The more complex the struggle between the two lines becomes, the more the revolutionary committee emphasizes the education of the struggle between the two lines. To this end, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has quickly spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every household in the province, fully mobilizing the masses to set up tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing the people of the entire province to concentrate on repeatedly studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, greatly praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and specially emphasizing the leading position of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the history of the Chinese revolution. Regarding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Chairman Mao's views on class, class struggle, and continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we are determined to talk about it every day, every month, every year, and every generation, letting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply take root among the broad revolutionary masses, making every word and deed of the broad masses conform to the track of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and using all revolutionary forces to achieve the combat tasks proposed in the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and ensuring that the proletarian state will never change color for thousands of generations!

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must carry forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution

Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and provincial military region responsible person Wen Daohong said: At the crucial moment of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" has been re-published. The people of the entire province of Jiangxi, through studying this brilliant document, have greatly raised their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines and greatly inspired the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, powerfully promoting the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution in the entire province.

More than two years of Cultural Revolution have already achieved great and decisive victories. Now, we are entering a new stage of comprehensive struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is the continuation of the struggle between the two lines. The great task facing us is both great and extremely arduous. At this time, we re-study Chairman Mao's brilliant document, the report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and feel particularly close to it, drawing great enlightenment from it. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried attitude, and comrades must continue to maintain a hardworking attitude." Although Chairman Mao's teachings were directed at the situation where the country was about to be liberated at that time, they are also like talking about our situation today. Today, the Cultural Revolution has achieved extremely great victories, and anyone who does not see this victory is blind. However, we are proletarian revolutionaries who are thorough, and we must lead the broad masses to look forward and see the more arduous and great combat tasks ahead of us. Otherwise, we will become complacent and self-satisfied in the face of achievements, relax our fighting spirit, stop moving forward, and the Cultural Revolution will be half-hearted. Therefore, we must always maintain a modest and unhurried attitude and establish the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution. We should always remember that classes still exist, fierce class struggles still exist, and imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries still exist. The life of a proletarian revolutionary warrior cannot be measured by time or past merits; it should be measured by loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and revolutionary spirit.

We must thoroughly revolutionize and carry the revolution through to the end, completely following Chairman Mao's words and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and every instruction from Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do. As long as we follow the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will surely achieve the final victory.

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must insist on firmly grasping class struggle without deviation

Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and revolutionary leading cadre Yu Dexin said: Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "We must learn to fight against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in cities in terms of politics, economics, and culture, and to fight against imperialists in terms of diplomacy. We must learn to fight against them openly and secretly. If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to fight against these people and achieve victory in the struggle, we will not be able to maintain our power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail." Today, at the critical moment when the Cultural Revolution is approaching comprehensive victory, we review Chairman Mao's great teachings and feel that they are extremely wise and correct. Chairman Mao's great teachings guide us to firmly grasp class struggle without deviation and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The closer the Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more the class enemies will struggle desperately and fight to the death with us. Therefore, we must not relax our fighting spirit and loosen our class vigilance just because the Cultural Revolution has achieved great and decisive victories. If we relax class struggle in a good situation, not only will we not be able to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, but the victories we have already achieved will also be in danger of being lost. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously attack the class enemies, and in the struggle to achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, wipe out the class enemies.

From the day of its birth, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," has led the heroic people of Jinggangshan to launch unrelenting and fierce attacks on the class enemies. The leading members of the provincial revolutionary committee stand on the front line of class struggle, personally go deep into the grassroots units, conduct investigations and research, grasp the new characteristics and trends of class struggle, participate in battles, and command battles. At the same time, they widely mobilize the masses, lead the broad revolutionary masses to thoroughly criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," thoroughly eliminate its poison in various fields, and accurately and fiercely strike a small handful of class enemies, carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must do a good job of our own ideological revolutionization

Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and provincial revolutionary committee responsible person Tu Lie said: While carrying out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines in the entire province, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee organized the people of the entire province to study and apply the "Three Articles" extensively, thoroughly transforming their worldview. Now, a new high tide of studying and applying the "Three Articles" has emerged in cities and countryside throughout the province, and the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and the people have taken the "Three Articles" as their motto, genuinely carrying out their own ideological revolutionization.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must do a good job of our own ideological revolutionization. The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a political revolution that touches people's souls. As the struggle between the two lines deepens and the struggle, criticism, and transformation mass movement deepens, the revolution becomes more profound in touching people's souls and more sharply attacks the bourgeois "self." Therefore, at this important moment of seizing comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, it is particularly necessary for us to use the brilliant thoughts of the "Three Articles" to constantly revolutionize ourselves, break with the "self" and establish the "public," and thoroughly transform our worldview. Only in this way can we correctly understand and firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.
