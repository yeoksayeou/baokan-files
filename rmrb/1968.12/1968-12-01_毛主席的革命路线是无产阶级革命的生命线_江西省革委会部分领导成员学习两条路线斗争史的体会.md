Under the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has mobilized the masses to launch a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. The people of Jiangxi, who are deeply loyal to Chairman Mao, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, reviewed Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and enthusiastically discussed the important editorial "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" by the Central Party newspapers and journals. They have received profound education and great encouragement, significantly raising their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. Some leading members of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently shared their experiences at a meeting to study the history of the struggle between the two lines.

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must let the masses grasp Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Cheng Shiqing said: Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee are the great guidelines for deepening the struggle between the two lines. The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the re-publication of Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee are another great strategic deployment by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. This has important significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. After more than two years of tempering by the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, which has enabled them to deeply understand the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have deeply understood that "this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Thus, they have raised the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines to a new level, more closely united around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unified in thought, step, and action, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

More than forty years ago, Chairman Mao came to Jinggangshan to establish the first revolutionary base in the country and led the Anshan workers' strike. Since then, the people of Jiangxi have been nurtured by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and have risen up to make revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, from victory to victory. The people of Jiangxi have personally experienced that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of the proletarian revolution and the red thread that guides the proletarian revolution from victory to victory. In this Cultural Revolution, the people of Jiangxi, following Chairman Mao's great teachings of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly smashed the reactionary stronghold of Liu Shaoqi's agent Fang Zhichun in Jiangxi. At present, the people of the entire province are fully launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, and implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including various cultural fields. The entire province has already sent 500,000 cadres and urban residents to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants and to carry out socialist revolution and construction in the countryside together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. With the unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, the spiritual face of the people of the entire province has undergone extremely profound and inspiring changes, and a high tide of great leaps forward in industry and agriculture is about to appear. All of this is the glorious achievement of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and it is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, when grasped by the broad revolutionary masses, will become a spiritual atomic bomb against revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, ensuring that our party and country will never change color for thousands of generations. From the day of its establishment, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has always insisted on emphasizing the education of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, making Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and better grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. The more complex the struggle between the two lines becomes, the more the revolutionary committee emphasizes the education of the struggle between the two lines. To this end, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has quickly spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every household in the province, fully mobilizing the masses to set up tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing the people of the entire province to concentrate on repeatedly studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, greatly praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and specially emphasizing the leading position of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the history of the Chinese revolution. Regarding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Chairman Mao's views on class, class struggle, and continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we are determined to talk about it every day, every month, every year, and every generation, letting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply take root among the broad revolutionary masses, making every word and deed of the broad masses conform to the track of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and using all revolutionary forces to achieve the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and ensuring that the proletarian state will never change color for thousands of generations!

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must carry forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution

Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and provincial military region responsible person Wen Daohong said: At the crucial moment of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" has been re-published. The people of the entire province of Jiangxi, through studying this brilliant document, have greatly raised their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines and greatly inspired the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, powerfully promoting the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution in the entire province.

More than two years of Cultural Revolution have already achieved great and decisive victories. Now, we are entering a new stage of comprehensive struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is the continuation of the struggle between the two lines. The great task facing us is both great and extremely arduous. At this time, we re-study Chairman Mao's brilliant document, the report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and feel particularly close to it, drawing great enlightenment from it. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried attitude, and comrades must continue to maintain a hardworking attitude." Although Chairman Mao's teachings were directed at the situation where the country was about to be liberated at that time, they are also like talking about our situation today. Today, the Cultural Revolution has achieved extremely great victories, and anyone who does not see this victory is blind. However, we are proletarian revolutionaries who are thorough, and we must lead the broad masses to look forward and see the more arduous and great combat tasks ahead of us. Otherwise, we will become complacent and self-satisfied in the face of achievements, relax our fighting spirit, stop moving forward, and the Cultural Revolution will be half-hearted. Therefore, we must always maintain a modest and unhurried attitude and establish the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution. We should always remember that classes still exist, fierce class struggles still exist, and imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries still exist. The life of a proletarian revolutionary warrior cannot be measured by time or past merits; it should be measured by loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and revolutionary spirit.

We must thoroughly revolutionize and carry the revolution through to the end, completely following Chairman Mao's words and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and every instruction from Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do. As long as we follow the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will surely achieve the final victory.

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must insist on firmly grasping class struggle without deviation

Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and revolutionary leading cadre Yu Dexin said: Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "We must learn to fight against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in cities in terms of politics, economics, and culture, and to fight against imperialists in terms of diplomacy. We must learn to fight against them openly and secretly. If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to fight against these people and achieve victory in the struggle, we will not be able to maintain our power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail." Today, at the critical moment when the Cultural Revolution is approaching comprehensive victory, we review Chairman Mao's great teachings and feel that they are extremely wise and correct. Chairman Mao's great teachings guide us to firmly grasp class struggle without deviation and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The closer the Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more the class enemies will struggle desperately and fight to the death with us. Therefore, we must not relax our fighting spirit and loosen our class vigilance just because the Cultural Revolution has achieved great and decisive victories. If we relax class struggle in a good situation, not only will we not be able to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, but the victories we have already achieved will also be in danger of being lost. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously attack the class enemies, and in the struggle to achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, wipe out the class enemies.

From the day of its birth, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," has led the heroic people of Jinggangshan to launch unrelenting and fierce attacks on the class enemies. The leading members of the provincial revolutionary committee stand on the front line of class struggle, personally go deep into the grassroots units, conduct investigations and research, grasp the new characteristics and trends of class struggle, participate in battles, and command battles. At the same time, they widely mobilize the masses, lead the broad revolutionary masses to thoroughly criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," thoroughly eliminate its poison in various fields, and accurately and fiercely strike a small handful of class enemies, carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must do a good job of our own ideological revolutionization

Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and provincial revolutionary committee responsible person Tu Lie said: While carrying out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines in the entire province, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee organized the people of the entire province to study and apply the "Three Articles" extensively, thoroughly transforming their worldview. Now, a new high tide of studying and applying the "Three Articles" has emerged in cities and countryside throughout the province, and the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and the people have taken the "Three Articles" as their motto, genuinely carrying out their own ideological revolutionization.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." To carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must do a good job of our own ideological revolutionization. The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a political revolution that touches people's souls. As the struggle between the two lines deepens and the struggle, criticism, and transformation mass movement deepens, the revolution becomes more profound in touching people's souls and more sharply attacks the bourgeois "self." Therefore, at this important moment of seizing comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, it is particularly necessary for us to use the brilliant thoughts of the "Three Articles" to constantly revolutionize ourselves, break with the "self" and establish the "public," and thoroughly transform our worldview. Only in this way can we correctly understand and firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    毛主席的革命路线是无产阶级革命的生命线
    江西省革委会部分领导成员学习两条路线斗争史的体会
    本报讯　在党的八届十二中全会伟大号令下，江西省革命委员会，最广泛地发动群众，掀起了学习两条路线斗争史的运动。无限忠于毛主席的井冈山儿女，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，重温毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，热烈讨论中央两报一刊《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》的重要社论，受到深刻的教育、巨大的鼓舞，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。江西省革委会部分领导成员在最近一次“两条路线斗争史的学习会”上，介绍了这方面的体会。
    要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，必须让群众掌握毛主席革命路线
    江西省革委会主任程世清说：毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席的这一最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，是深入开展两条路线斗争的伟大纲领。毛主席最新指示的发表和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告这一划时代光辉文献的重新发表，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的又一伟大战略部署，对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利具有重要的意义。经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命洗礼的广大革命群众，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，就能更深刻地领会到毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命学说的无比正确，更深刻地领会到“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的”道理，从而把两条路线斗争的觉悟提高到新的高度，更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    四十多年前，毛主席来到井冈山建立全国第一个革命根据地，领导安源工人大罢工。从那时起，江西人民就受到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的哺育，就在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下起来干革命，从胜利走向胜利。江西人民亲身体会到，毛主席的革命路线是无产阶级革命的生命线，是指引无产阶级革命从胜利走向胜利的红线。在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，江西人民遵照毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的伟大教导，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，彻底摧毁了刘少奇在江西的代理人方志纯所盘踞的反动堡垒。目前，全省人民正全面掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，深入开展革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作，实现无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政。全省已有五十万干部和城市人员到农村接受贫下中农再教育，同时和贫下中农一起进行农村的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。随着伟大的毛泽东思想的空前大普及，全省人民的精神面貌发生了极其深刻、令人鼓舞的变化，一个工农业生产大跃进的高潮即将出现。所有这一切，都是毛主席革命路线深入人心的辉煌成果，都是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线被广大革命人民群众所掌握，就会变成反修防修的精神原子弹，保证我们党和国家千秋万代永不改变颜色，谁要搞资本主义复辟就休想得逞。江西省革命委员会，从成立那天起，始终坚持狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线日益深入人心，更好地为广大革命群众所掌握。两条路线斗争越复杂，革命委员会越是狠抓两条路线斗争的教育。为此，江西省革命委员会最迅速地把毛主席的最新指示传播到全省每家每户，充分发动群众开办了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，组织全省人民集中地反复地学习两条路线斗争的历史，大颂特颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在中国革命史上的领导地位。对于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争和在无产阶级专政下继续革命的观点，我们决心天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，代代讲，让毛主席的革命路线在广大革命人民群众中深深扎根，使广大人民群众的一言一行都纳入毛主席无产阶级革命路线的轨道，把一切革命力量都用到实现八届十二中全会公报提出的战斗任务上去，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使无产阶级江山千秋万代永不变色！
      要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，
  必须发扬不断革命彻底革命的精神
    省革委会常委、省军区负责人文道宏说：正当夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》重新发表了。江西全省人民通过学习这一光辉文献，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，大大焕发了不断革命和彻底革命精神，有力地推动了全省无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。
    两年多的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。现在，正进入一个全面斗、批、改的新阶段。这是两条路线斗争的继续。摆在我们面前的任务是伟大的，也是异常艰巨的。在这个时候，我们重新学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告这一光辉文献，感到格外地亲切，从中吸取了极大的教益。毛主席教导我们：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”毛主席这一教导，虽然是针对当时全国快要解放的形势讲的，但是也象讲我们今天的情况一样。今天无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了极其伟大的胜利，谁要看不到这个胜利，就是瞎子。但是，我们是无产阶级彻底革命的战士，我们必须率领广大群众向前看，看到摆在我们面前的更加伟大、更加艰巨的战斗任务。否则，就会在成绩面前自满自足起来，就会松懈自己的斗志，停顿不前，无产阶级文化大革命就会半途而废。为此，我们必须时刻保持不骄不躁的作风，树立不断革命、彻底革命的精神。我们应当时刻想到阶级还存在，激烈的阶级斗争还存在，帝修反还存在。我们一个无产阶级革命战士的一生，不能用时间来计算，用过去的功劳来计算；要用对毛主席革命路线的忠心，用革命的精神来计算。
    我们要彻底革命，把革命进行到底，就应该完完全全地听毛主席的话，坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线，执行毛主席的每一个指示。毛主席怎么说的，我们就怎么办。只要我们在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，再接再厉，最后胜利一定是属于我们的。
      要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，
  必须坚持狠抓阶级斗争不转向
    省革委会常委、革命领导干部于德馨说：伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告中指出：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，并向帝国主义者作外交斗争。既要学会同他们作公开的斗争，又要学会同他们作荫蔽的斗争。如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。”今天在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的关键时刻，我们重温毛主席的这一伟大教导，感到无比英明，无比正确。毛主席的伟大教导指引着我们狠抓阶级斗争不转向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人必然要进行垂死挣扎，同我们作拚死的斗争。因此，我们决不能因为文化大革命取得了伟大的决定性的胜利，而松懈自己的斗志，放松阶级警惕性。如果我们在大好形势下放松阶级斗争，不仅不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，而且已经取得的胜利果实也会有丧失的危险。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，把阶级敌人一网打尽。
    江西省革命委员会从诞生的那天起，遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，率领英雄的井冈山儿女向阶级敌人发动了不停顿的猛烈的进攻。省革委会领导成员站在阶级斗争第一线，亲自深入基层单位，蹲点调查研究，掌握阶级斗争的新特点、新动向，参加战斗，指挥战斗。同时，广泛地发动群众，带领广大革命群众狠批大叛徒刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，彻底肃清其在各个领域的流毒，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
      要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，
  必须搞好自身思想革命化
    省革委会常委、省大联筹负责人涂烈说：江西省革命委员会在全省开展两条路线斗争史学习运动的同时，组织全省人民大学大用“老三篇”，彻底改造世界观。现在，全省城乡出现了活学活用“老三篇”的新高潮，广大的工人、贫下中农、革命知识分子和广大人民群众都以“老三篇”为座右铭，切实搞好自身的思想革命化。
    林彪同志指示我们：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就必须搞好自身的思想革命化。无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的政治大革命，随着两条路线斗争的深入展开，随着斗、批、改群众运动的深入发展，革命越来越深刻地触及到人们的灵魂，越来越尖锐地向资产阶级“私”字展开进攻。这样，在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要时刻，就特别需要我们用“老三篇”的光辉思想，不断革自己的命，破“私”立“公”，彻底改造世界观。这样，才能正确理解、坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务。
