The great traitor, great spy, and great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi personally directed the production of the reactionary film *Visit to Indonesia*. Not only did he shamelessly glorify the representatives of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, the extremely reactionary Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique, and the thousand-holes-ridden social landscape under the rule of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, but he also enthusiastically praised the counter-revolutionary armed forces—West Silivangji Division—nurtured by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. For this division, which is the "gun" of the Indonesian bourgeoisie's right-wing, Liu Shaoqi could not stop praising it, especially instructing that in the film's commentary, it should be hyped up as the "revolutionary tool" that "realizes the ideals of the Indonesian people."

For the revolutionary masses of the Indonesian people, Liu Shaoqi put on a hypocritical face of a missionary, forbidding the people from picking up the gun to overthrow the reactionary regime, and vigorously advocating "legal struggle" and "parliamentary road," opposing armed struggle.

Liu Shaoqi praises the gun one moment and opposes it the next, revealing the ugly face of an imperialist running dog and a traitor to the workers' movement! Liu Shaoqi praises the bourgeoisie's gun and opposes the proletariat's gun, ultimately aiming to maintain the shaky counter-revolutionary rule of the bourgeoisie and suppress the surging proletarian revolution.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "The working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the power of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun." The history of China's revolutionary struggle has proven: once the working class has the gun, it has everything; without the gun, it loses everything. The revolutionary people of the world must pick up the gun and take the road of armed struggle. The "parliamentary road" advocated by Liu Shaoqi is a road that leads to the loss of the revolution and the nation. As early as the 1920s, Liu Shaoqi used the treacherous tactic of deceiving the working class into laying down their guns, drowning the thriving revolutionary movement in Wuhan in a sea of blood; today, when the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries are flourishing, Liu Shaoqi, with his old tricks of an inner spy and a scoundrel, attempts to lead the revolutionary people of Indonesia onto the road of revisionism and capitulationism, bowing their heads and allowing themselves to be butchered by the bourgeoisie, fundamentally destroying the revolutionary cause of the Indonesian people, and achieving the evil goal of consolidating the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "The pen and the gun, seizing power relies on these two." Consolidating power also relies on these two. Liu Shaoqi not only schemed to make the Indonesian people lay down their guns but also used every means to make the Indonesian people lay down their pens, working tirelessly to consolidate the reactionary rule of the Indonesian bourgeoisie!

To implement the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three surrenders and one annihilation" and sabotage the revolutionary cause of the people of the world, Liu Shaoqi, soon after his "visit" to Indonesia, impatiently dispatched his agent in the Beijing Film Studio to lead a film delegation to "visit" Indonesia again. This "film delegation," following the instructions of their black master, did not mention Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line at all, did not talk about armed struggle, but with honeyed words and a knife in the heart, wanted the revolutionary people of Indonesia to throw away their "pen," completely accepting the leadership of the bourgeoisie. They said nonsense like: "Revolutionary literary and artistic workers should join the film industry under the leadership of the bourgeoisie, think of every possible way to cooperate with healthy-minded producers to make films." After making films that "reflect the political demands of the people," they would "naturally gain the welcome of the broad masses," "and at the same time, encourage producers to be more willing to cooperate." In this way, a "progressive film team" would gradually be formed. This is absurd logic! Extremely reactionary theory!

In fact, the films allowed by the bourgeoisie to be shot can never reflect the "political demands of the people"; films that "gain the welcome of the broad masses" will absolutely not "encourage" the bourgeoisie's "producers"; the bourgeoisie will never cultivate a "progressive film team" for the proletariat! As Great Leader Chairman Mao said:

"In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." Liu Shaoqi and his agents advocating for a "progressive film team" under the leadership of bourgeoisie "producers," making films that are both welcomed by the proletariat and can "encourage" the bourgeoisie, is using every trick to make the Indonesian Communist Party and the proletariat give up the leadership of cultural arts and the film industry, maintaining the artistic front for the Indonesian reactionaries, consolidating the artistic front, and seizing the artistic front, aiming to consolidate the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

The film "delegation" dispatched by Liu Shaoqi also vigorously recommended the reactionary films *Early Spring in February* and *Revolutionary Family*, which were highly praised by Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, vigorously peddling Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle, and extensively propagating Liu Shaoqi's line of class conciliationism and class capitulationism of "legal struggle" and "parliamentary road," playing a very vicious role.

In 1965, the Suharto-Nasution counter-revolutionary right-wing military clique in Indonesia finally used the pens they controlled to create sufficient counter-revolutionary public opinion, raised the guns they held, and crazily shot at the revolutionary people. The revolutionary cause of Indonesia suffered brutal suppression; the revolutionary people of Indonesia were brutally massacred!

However, "the rampancy of all internal and external dark forces creates national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength but also shows their last struggle, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory." Communists cannot be exterminated, and the flames of revolution cannot be extinguished. Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the revolutionary people of Indonesia are firmly grasping the two barrels, waging a new and great revolutionary struggle. As recently pointed out in the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party delegation: "After abandoning the revisionist 'peaceful road,' at present, the Marxist-Leninists of Indonesia, under the guidance of the new 'three banners' of the Party in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, are leading the long-term people's armed struggle to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in the vast rural areas."

The thousand-island country is filled with guns, and a new revolutionary upsurge is coming. Victory will definitely belong to the revolutionary people of Indonesia.

    紧握两杆子　彻底闹革命
    ——批判刘少奇破坏印尼人民革命的滔天罪行
    首都工人、解放军驻北京电影制片厂毛泽东思想宣传队
    北京电影制片厂革命大联合委员会
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇赤膊上阵，亲自炮制的反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》，不仅无耻地美化了印尼资产阶级代表人物，美化了反动透顶的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团，美化了印尼资产阶级统治下千疮百孔的社会面貌，还极力颂扬了由美帝、苏修豢养的反革命武装——西利万吉师。对于这支印尼资产阶级右派的“枪杆子”，刘少奇赞不绝口，特别指令要在影片的解说词中，把它吹捧为“实现印尼人民理想的”“革命工具”。
    对于印尼革命人民群众，刘少奇却摆出了一副虚伪透顶的传教士面孔，不许人民拿起枪杆子，推翻反动政权，竭力鼓吹“合法斗争”、“议会道路”，反对武装斗争。
    刘少奇一会儿赞美枪杆子，一会儿又反对枪杆子，从这变幻不定的表情中，活现出一副帝国主义的走狗、工人运动叛徒的丑恶嘴脸！刘少奇赞美资产阶级的枪杆子，反对无产阶级的枪杆子，归根结底，就是要维护资产阶级摇摇欲坠的反革命统治，镇压风起云涌的无产阶级革命。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。“工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”中国革命斗争历史雄辩地证明：工人阶级有了枪杆子，就有了一切；没有枪杆子，就丧失一切。世界革命人民要获得解放，必须拿起枪杆子，走武装斗争的道路。刘少奇鼓吹的“议会道路”是断送革命的亡国亡头道路。早在二十年代，刘少奇就以欺骗工人阶级放下枪杆子的阴险手段，把武汉的轰轰烈烈的革命运动，淹没在血泊之中；在世界各国人民的革命运动正在蓬蓬勃勃发展的今天，刘少奇又以这套内奸、工贼的惯伎，妄图把印尼革命人民引上修正主义、投降主义的道路，俯首帖耳地听任资产阶级的宰割，从根本上葬送印尼人民的革命事业，达到巩固资产阶级专政的罪恶目的。
    林副主席说：“笔杆子、枪杆子，夺取政权靠这两杆子。”巩固政权也要靠这两杆子。刘少奇不仅处心积虑地要印尼人民放下枪杆子，还千方百计地要印尼人民放下笔杆子，为巩固印尼资产阶级反动政权，他真是苦心孤诣地效尽了犬马之劳！
    刘少奇为了推行“三降一灭”的反革命修正主义路线，破坏世界人民的革命事业，他“访问”印尼回国不久，又急不可耐地派遣他在北京电影制片厂的代理人率领电影代表团，再次“访问”了印尼。这个电影“代表团”，秉承其黑主子的旨意，根本不提毛主席的革命文艺路线，矢口不谈武装斗争，却口蜜腹剑地要印尼革命人民丢掉“笔杆子”，完全接受资产阶级的领导。他胡说什么：“革命文艺工作者，应该投入资产阶级领导下的电影界，想尽办法争取有健康思想的制片商，进行合作拍片。”当你们拍出“反映了人民政治要求的影片后，就必然获得广大群众的欢迎”，“同时也鼓舞了制片商更加愿意合作下去”。这样，就“逐步地形成了进步的电影队伍”。这真是荒唐透顶的逻辑！反动已极的理论！
    事实上，资产阶级所容许拍摄的影片，根本就不可能反映“人民政治要求”；而“获得广大群众的欢迎”的革命影片，也绝对不会“鼓舞”资产阶级的“制片商”；资产阶级更不可能为无产阶级培养什么“进步的电影队伍”！正如伟大领袖毛主席所说：
  “在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”刘少奇及其代理人鼓吹在资产阶级“制片商”领导下搞什么“进步的电影队伍”，拍什么既受无产阶级“欢迎”，又能“鼓舞”资产阶级的影片，就是在用尽心机地要印尼共产党和无产阶级放弃对文化艺术、电影事业的领导权，为印尼反动派保持文艺阵地，巩固文艺阵地，争夺文艺阵地，就是要巩固资产阶级专政。
    刘少奇派遣的这个电影“代表团”，还拚命向印尼人民推荐被刘少奇及其同伙大肆吹捧的反动影片《早春二月》和《革命家庭》，拚命兜售刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大肆宣扬刘少奇的“合法斗争”、“议会道路”的阶级调和主义和阶级投降主义路线，起了极其恶劣的作用。
    一九六五年，印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反革命右派军人集团，终于利用他们掌握的笔杆子，造足了反革命舆论，举起他们把持的枪杆子，向革命人民疯狂射击了。印尼的革命事业，受到了残酷的镇压；印尼的革命人民，惨遭血腥屠杀！
    但是，“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”共产党人是杀不绝的，革命的火焰是扑不灭的。印尼革命人民，在印尼共产党的领导下，正牢牢地握紧两杆子，进行新的、伟大的革命斗争。正如最近印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团发表的声明中所指出：“在抛弃修正主义的‘和平道路’以后，当前，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者，在符合毛泽东思想的党的新的
  ‘三面旗帜’的照耀下，正在广大的农村地区领导推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的长期的人民武装斗争。”
    千岛之国，刀枪林立，一个新的革命高潮正在到来，胜利一定属于印度尼西亚革命人民。
