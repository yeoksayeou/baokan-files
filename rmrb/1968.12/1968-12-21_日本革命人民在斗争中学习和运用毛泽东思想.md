Japanese Revolutionary People Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought in Struggle

	Bravely Throw Themselves into the Fiery Struggle

	Japanese youth printer, Yamano, was deeply moved when he heard on the radio on the night of September 17 this year, Chairman Mao's important inscription to Japanese worker friends six years ago: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt." He was so excited that he could not help but shout, "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

	This young printer used Chairman Mao's teaching to summarize his experiences in the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries over the past few years. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, a powerful ideological weapon for the Japanese people and the people of the world to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. As long as we combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution and take the path of violent revolution, the Japanese people will definitely achieve the final victory."

	Before becoming a printer, Yamano lived for a long time in Fukuoka Prefecture, where there is a U.S. military base. He suffered greatly from the brutal exploitation of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and witnessed the arrogance of the U.S. military in Japan. He also saw how the Soviet revisionists and the Rybun revisionist clique colluded with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, using every means to sabotage the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people. The harsh reality educated Yamano, and especially through the study of Chairman Mao's works, he came to understand the truth of revolution and bravely threw himself into the fiery struggle.

	As early as October 1967, when the head of the Japanese reactionary government, Sato Eisaku, was leaving from the heavily guarded Haneda Airport in Tokyo to Washington to visit his American masters, Yamano, along with other Japanese youth, held up red flags with the words "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" and, despite the suppression of a large number of reactionary military police, rushed into Haneda Airport to protest against the Japanese reactionary government's collusion with U.S. imperialism. Sato Eisaku fled like a mangy dog, tail between his legs, into the airplane. Since then, whether in the struggle against the entry of U.S. nuclear submarines into Japanese ports or in the anti-U.S. struggle in Sanrizuka, Yamano, under the inspiration of the great Mao Zedong Thought, has always been at the forefront of the struggle, fighting bravely.

	Yamano also often engraves wax plates by himself and prints leaflets to widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the masses.

	Launch a Prolonged and Ferocious Attack on the Enemy

	Yokonaga, a farmer from Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka, is a revolutionary youth who persistently studies Chairman Mao's works and strives to guide his actions with Mao Zedong Thought. While participating in production labor, he also joins other farmers in resolutely fighting against the Sato reactionary government.

	In the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport," Yokonaga, linking the struggle with reality, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Protracted War." Based on his study, he analyzed the current situation of the enemy and ourselves to the farmers and encouraged everyone with the thought that "the greatest depth of the power of war lies in the masses." Yokonaga said, "Chairman Mao's teachings have shown us the bright path for the struggle in Sanrizuka. To achieve victory, we must persist in protracted struggle."

	This year, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, in order to seize the land of the Sanrizuka farmers to build the airport, have repeatedly sent armed police to suppress the farmers who oppose the construction of the airport. Facing the fascist atrocities of the reactionary police, Yokonaga and the farmers, under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, have persisted in a struggle of counterattack. To block the reactionary police from entering Sanrizuka, Yokonaga and the farmers together built various obstacles on the key transport routes around Sanrizuka. When the reactionary police attacked the masses, Yokonaga, along with his comrades, wielded sharp-edged long-handled sickles and charged at the reactionary police, engaging in a fierce battle.

	This young farmer, Yokonaga, who often wears a shining Mao Zedong badge on his chest and holds a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his hands, said with confidence, "Only by mobilizing the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and launching a prolonged and ferocious attack on the enemy can we ultimately defeat the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries."

	Experience the Storms of Mass Struggles

	This year, a new fighting force composed of more than 4,000 workers and students emerged in Osaka, Japan. In the struggle against the U.S. imperialists using the Itami International Airport to invade Vietnam in August, they fought more than 6,000 reactionary police to a standstill.

	Patriotic youth student, Ota, showed great bravery in this struggle. Even after being injured by the police, he continued to fight. Ota said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to face the wind and rain and see the world. This wind and rain is the great storm of mass struggles, and this world is the great world of mass struggles. We Osaka youth have joined the revolutionary struggle according to Chairman Mao's teachings."

	Ota talked about how he and his comrades, before launching the struggle at Itami International Airport, participated in the struggle against the entry of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" into Sasebo Port, supported the Sanrizuka farmers in their struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport," and participated in the struggle against the U.S. military hospital in Tokyo. Ota said with deep feeling, "Our Osaka youth fighting force has grown through struggle. We started with just a few people, but because we insisted on learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in struggle and firmly relying on the masses, after more than two months, not only did our numbers increase many times over, but more importantly, our revolutionary spirit has become more and more vigorous."

	Practice is Learning

	In Fukuoka City, university student Yoshida and his classmates bravely joined the struggle against the entry of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" into Sasebo Port in January this year. He quoted the great teacher Chairman Mao's teaching: "Revolutionary war is the people's affair. It is often not a matter of learning first and then doing, but of doing and then learning. Doing is learning." He said that participating in the anti-U.S. struggle in Sasebo made him understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching.

	Since then, Yoshida has actively participated in the struggle to dismantle the U.S. military's Yamada ammunition depot in Kitakyushu, the struggle against the U.S. military base in Itazuke, and the struggle against the U.S. military hospital in Tokyo. He also enthusiastically went to Tokyo to support students in their struggle against the decadent bourgeois education system and rushed to Sanrizuka in Chiba Prefecture to support farmers in their struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' construction of the airport.

	He told people, "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the world revolution in contemporary times, a weapon of revolutionary thought. We Japanese revolutionary people must firmly grasp this weapon. We are convinced that as long as we insist on learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, rely on the broad masses of the people, and carry forward the spirit of 'moving mountains with perseverance,' then through struggle, we will definitely achieve liberation."

### 日本革命人民在斗争中学习和运用毛泽东思想

    日本革命人民在斗争中学习和运用毛泽东思想
    勇敢地投身于火热的斗争
    日本青年印刷工人海野今年九月十七日夜间，从收音机里听到毛主席六年前书赠日本工人朋友们的重要题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”他心情非常激动，情不自禁地欢呼：“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    这位年轻的印刷工人用毛主席的这一教导，总结了自己几年来同美日反动派斗争的经验。他说：“毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是日本人民和世界人民战胜帝、修、反的强大思想武器。只要把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，走暴力革命的道路，日本人民就一定能够取得最后胜利。”
    海野在当印刷工人以前，长期居住在设有美军基地的福冈县。他饱尝了美日反动派的残酷压榨，目睹美军在日本的横行霸道；也看到了苏修和宫本修正主义集团同美日反动派互相勾结，千方百计地破坏日本人民革命斗争的累累罪行。严酷的现实，教育了海野，特别是通过对毛主席著作的学习，使他认识了革命的真理，勇敢地投身到火热的斗争中去。
    早在一九六七年十月间，当日本反动政府的头目佐藤荣作从戒备森严的东京羽田机场乘飞机去华盛顿拜见美国主子的时候，海野就同其他日本青年一起，高举写着“毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗，不顾大批反动军警的镇压，冲进羽田机场，抗议日本反动政府同美帝加紧勾结，吓得佐藤荣作象一条癞皮狗似地夹着尾巴偷偷溜进飞机逃掉。此后，无论是在反对美国核潜艇进驻日本港口的斗争中，还是在三里塚的反美斗争中，海野在伟大的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，都站在斗争第一线，勇敢战斗。
    海野还在斗争中，经常自己刻蜡板，印传单，向群众广泛地宣传毛泽东思想。
    向敌人发动持久猛烈的进攻
    日本千叶县三里塚的农民横永，是一位坚持学习毛主席著作，努力用毛泽东思想指导自己行动的革命青年。他一面参加生产劳动，一面同其他农民一起向佐藤反动政府进行坚决的斗争。
    在反对美日反动派修建“新东京国际机场”的斗争中，横永联系斗争实际，学习了毛主席的光辉著作《论持久战》。他根据自己的学习体会向农民们分析了当前斗争中的敌、我情况，并用“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”的思想，鼓励大家。横永说：“毛主席的教导，给我们三里塚的斗争指出了光明的道路，我们要取得胜利，必须坚持持久的斗争。”
    今年以来，美日反动派为了霸占三里塚农民的土地修建机场，不断派出武装警察去镇压反对修建机场的农民群众。面对着反动警察的法西斯暴行，横永和农民们在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，坚持了针锋相对的斗争。为了阻拦反动警察闯进三里塚，横永和农民们一道，在三里塚周围的交通要道筑起各种障碍物，当反动警察向群众进攻时，横永就同战友们拿起磨得锋利的长柄镰刀，冲向反动警察，同他们进行英勇的搏斗。
    这位经常胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手里捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》的青年农民横永，充满信心地说：“只有用毛泽东思想发动群众，向敌人进行持久的猛烈的进攻，才能最后战胜美日反动派。”
    经历群众斗争的大风雨
    今年，日本大阪出现了一支由四千多工人和学生组成的新的战斗队伍。他们在八月间掀起的反对美帝利用伊丹国际机场进行侵越战争的斗争中，把围攻他们的六千多名反动警察打得狼狈不堪。
    爱国青年学生太田，在这场斗争中表现得非常勇敢。他被警察打伤以后，仍然坚持斗争。太田说：“毛主席教导我们应该经风雨，见世面。这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。我们这批大阪青年就是根据毛主席的教导参加革命斗争的。”
    太田谈到他和自己的战友在掀起伊丹国际机场斗争以前，参加了反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”进驻佐世保港的斗争，参加了支援三里塚农民反对美日反动派修建“新东京国际机场”的斗争，参加了反对东京美军王子野战医院的斗争。太田深有体会地说：“我们大阪这支青年战斗队伍是在斗争中成长起来的。我们开始时只有几个人，但是，由于我们坚持在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决依靠群众，所以经过两个多月的时间，不仅人数增加了好多倍，更重要的是，我们的革命斗志越来越旺盛了。”
    干就是学习
    在福冈市，大学生吉田和他的同学今年一月从福冈赶到佐世保，勇敢地投入了反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”进驻佐世保港的斗争。他引用伟大导师毛主席的教导说：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”他说，在佐世保参加了这场反美斗争，使我懂得了毛主席这个教导的伟大意义。
    从此以后，吉田积极参加了北九州市拆除美军山田火药库的斗争，参加了反对板付美军基地的斗争。他还热情地跑到东京支持大学生们反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的斗争，赶到千叶县三里塚支援农民们反对美日反动派修建机场的斗争。
    他对人们说：“毛泽东思想是当代世界革命的指导思想，是革命的思想武器。我们日本革命人民必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。我们确信，只要我们坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，依靠广大人民群众，发扬‘愚公移山’的精神，那么，通过斗争，我们就一定能够获得解放。”
