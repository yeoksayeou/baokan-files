The peasants of the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Production Brigades of Changhe Brigade, Huade County, Jilin, guided by the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao on educational revolution, have created a brigade-run primary school by fighting against the bourgeois educational line. Over the past four years, this brigade-run school has defied the black wind and fought the waves, bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and growing stronger in the sharp struggle between the two lines.

	Building the School Ourselves

	This brigade originally had a public primary school, which, under the influence of the revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, emphasized "intellectual education first" and "grades as the criterion," pursuing so-called "standardization" and setting up numerous barriers, excluding many children of poor and lower-middle peasants from attending school. For example, in 1963, out of the 129 households of poor and lower-middle peasants in these four brigades, 27 children were unable to continue their education. Those who managed to stay in school were also subjected to the persecution of the bourgeois educational line, which stated, "Regardless of class, only the test scores matter." In 1964, the entire brigade had 36 graduates, 33 of whom were children of poor and lower-middle peasants, none of whom were admitted to middle school. However, out of the three children of landlords and rich peasants, one was admitted to middle school. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "This school is for the landlords and rich peasants, not for us poor and lower-middle peasants." With deep hatred for the bourgeois educational line, they established their first brigade-run primary school in a straw shed in June 1964.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants running a school is a revolutionary act against the bourgeoisie. The bourgeois elements, fearing the loss of educational power, fiercely counterattacked. They maliciously attacked, saying, "Illiterate peasants with a bag of grain cannot control the pen," and "The teacher is a pig herder; after two and a half years of schooling, what can he teach?" The poor and lower-middle peasants, hearing these words, were enraged and said with righteous indignation, "During the land reform, the landlords and rich peasants said that the old farmers couldn't handle the seal, but we have been in power for more than ten years, and everything in the countryside is better than before. Now you are doing the same thing again, and we are not afraid of it at all!" The landlords and rich peasants also incited, saying, "Nothing good can come out of a straw shed." The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly replied, "Even if our children roll in the wind and crawl in the rain, their hearts will become redder, and they will be more united with the poor and lower-middle peasants."

	Some people with old ideas also worried, "The school has no classrooms, no desks, no funds, and is not at all 'standardized.'" The poor and lower-middle peasants educated them, saying, "What 'standardization'? We poor people can't enter those 'standardized' schools. Studying the works of Chairman Mao is the true standardization! Lacking this or that is not scary, but lacking Mao Zedong Thought is scary."

	After repeated class struggles, the schemes of a small group of class enemies were finally smashed, and the old ideas of some people were corrected. The poor and lower-middle peasants decided to abolish the old system of age limits, tuition fees, examinations, and promotions and demotions, and to start everything from the convenience of the children of poor and lower-middle peasants entering school, making this brigade-run primary school better and better. The number of students in the school has increased from 19 at the beginning to 102.

	What Courses to Teach?

	The classroom is the main battlefield for the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Teaching materials are class-based. In the past, private schools and ancestral halls taught the feudal idea of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others," producing students who became officials riding on the heads of the working people. Bourgeois intellectuals instilled in students the idea of "fame and fortune," producing students who could not serve the people. The poor and lower-middle peasants deeply detested the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist line. They said, "The old textbooks cannot be used anymore. Thousands of books, tens of thousands of books, are not as good as reading Chairman Mao's Little Red Book." The poor and lower-middle peasants had the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian line and were the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. They followed the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin on actively learning and applying the works of Chairman Mao, resolutely discarded the old textbooks, and took up the shining Little Red Book. This struck at the heart of the bourgeois educational line. The walking capitalists of the commune center school were enraged by the revolutionary actions of the brigade-run school, repeatedly shouting, "Not teaching the prescribed textbooks is a criminal act!" But the poor and lower-middle peasants paid no attention to their nonsense. Immediately, the hat of "opposing the higher authorities" was thrown around, and a work team was sent to "expose the backers and seize the masterminds." The poor and lower-middle peasants were unyielding and said, "Everyone has a share in exposing the backers, and seizing the masterminds is the collective opinion." When the walking capitalists organized the struggle against the poor peasant teacher Sun Yonghai, the old poor peasant Xia Deyou, who had carried loads, asked them, "Vice Chairman Lin calls on the people of the whole country to study the works of Chairman Mao. Is it a crime for a teacher to spread Mao Zedong Thought?" The work team was speechless. After this struggle, the school did not collapse, and the students did not disperse.

	The struggle tempered the poor and lower-middle peasants' red hearts of loyalty to Chairman Mao and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; the struggle also ignited a new high tide of revolutionary teachers and students striving to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary teachers and students took the study of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as their main courses. At the same time, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, they broke away from the tedious and useless revisionist teaching materials, opening courses on class struggle education, production labor, military training, abacus, and health knowledge.

	What Kind of People to Cultivate?

	The question is whether to cultivate students into socially conscious, cultured laborers with socialist awareness or to turn students into spiritual nobles who are detached from politics, labor, and the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the focal point of the struggle between the two classes and two educational lines.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants most detested those who could not carry a shoulder pole or lift a basket, the bookish and the young masters. Therefore, as soon as the brigade-run school was established, two mu of "cultivating people's field" was allocated as the students' labor base and also as the battlefield for preventing and opposing revisionism. The students learned the skills of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments in the "cultivating people's field."

	Just as the students were enthusiastically engaged in scientific experiments and cultivating superior varieties in the "cultivating people's field," a small group of walking capitalists in the former county party committee hurriedly sent a work team. As soon as they arrived, they issued instructions: "The students are young and have little knowledge; they cannot engage in scientific experiments. Farming will exhaust the students." The walking capitalists shouted from above, and the ghosts and snakes jumped below, saying, "A bunch of kids can't do anything; it's better to abandon the land. If they are to work, why let the children study?" They echoed each other, singing and harmonizing. But the poor and lower-middle peasants knew that they were neither concerned about the students nor afraid of abandoning the land, but were destroying Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and snakes should be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely," the poor and lower-middle peasants launched a great denunciation and criticism of the revisionist educational system against these words and deeds. An old poor peasant said, "I have two children. The elder one was called 'stupid' by the family and was expelled from school; the younger one did not expect that the more he studied, the less he became, and at home, he did not touch the hoe and pickaxe. What kind of school is this?" Through deep exposure and powerful criticism, the brigade-run school resolutely took the road of combining education with productive labor.

	The growth and development of this brigade-run school fully prove the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "in the countryside, the school should be managed by the most reliable ally of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants" is extremely wise, completely showing that the brigade-run school is a new thing. Every step forward will encounter the destruction of class enemies and the "surrounding and annihilating" of the bourgeois educational line. Only by daring to struggle and daring to win can the people-run school take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    顶黑风战恶浪　自己动手办小学
    吉林四平军分区政治部、怀德县革委会报道组
    吉林怀德县长河大队第八、九、十、十一四个生产队的贫下中农，在毛主席的教育革命光辉思想的指引下，大造资产阶级教育路线的反，创造了一所队办小学。四年来，这所队办小学顶黑风，战恶浪，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，在两条路线的尖锐斗争中壮大成长。
      自　己　动　手　办　学
    这个大队原有一所公办小学，在叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的修正主义教育路线影响下，大搞“智育第一”“分数挂帅”，追求所谓“正规化”，设下了道道关卡，把许多贫下中农子女排挤在校门外。例如一九六三年，这四个生产队的一百二十九户贫下中农，就有二十七名子女不能读下去；勉强读下去的贫下中农子女，也在“不论阶级，不分人，只看一张考卷”的资产阶级教育路线的迫害下，考不上中学。一九六四年，全大队有毕业生三十六名，贫下中农子女三十三名，没有一名考上中学，而三名地富子女中，就有一名考上了中学。贫下中农气愤地说：“这个学校是给地富办的，不向咱贫下中农开门。”他们怀着对资产阶级教育路线的深仇大恨，于一九六四年六月在一间草栏子里创办了自己的第一所队办小学。
    贫下中农办学校，是无产阶级反对资产阶级的革命行动。资产阶级分子对丧失教育大权，如同失去生命一样，疯狂地进行反扑。他们大肆攻击：“大老粗斗大字不识一口袋，掌握不了文权”，“老师是个放猪的，上了二年半学，能教出个啥”。贫下中农听了这些话火窜三丈高，理直气壮地说：“土地改革时，地富就说‘老庄户’管不了大印，可是我们掌了十几年权，农村那一样不比过去强？现在你们又来这一套，一点也不稀罕！”地富分子还煽动：“草栏子里滚不出好玩艺。”贫下中农斩钉截铁地说：“咱们的孩子就是叫他在风里滚、雨里爬，越滚心越红，越滚越和贫下中农一条心。”
    有旧思想的人也担起心来了：“这学校一没教室、二没桌凳、三没经费，一点也不‘正规’。”贫下中农教育他们说：“要什么‘正规’？那些‘正规’学校，咱穷人进不去。学习毛主席著作才是正规！没这没那都不怕，就怕没有毛泽东思想。”
    经过反复的阶级较量，终于粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋破坏，纠正了一些人的旧思想。贫下中农决定废除学龄限制、交纳学费、考试以及升留级的旧制度，一切从方便贫下中农子女入学出发，使这所队办小学越办越好。全校学生已由开办时的十九名，增加到一百零二名。
      教　什　么　课？
    课堂是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺的主要阵地。教材是有阶级性的。过去私塾、祠堂教的是“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的封建思想，教出来的学生，是骑在劳动人民头上的官老爷。资产阶级知识分子，向学生灌输的是“成名成家”，教出来的学生哪能为人民服务？贫下中农对封、资、修那一套是深恶痛绝的。他们说：“旧课本说啥也不能再用了。千本书、万本书，不如读毛主席的红宝书。”贫下中农对毛主席的无产阶级感情最深，对毛泽东思想最忠，他们按照林副主席有关活学活用毛主席著作的指示，毅然决然地丢掉了旧课本，拿起了金光闪闪的红宝书。这下子可击中了资产阶级教育路线的要害。公社中心小学的走资派对队办小学的革命行动，暴跳如雷，三番五次地叫嚷：“不教规定的课本是犯法行为！”可是贫下中农根本不理他们那一套。顿时，“对抗上级”的大帽子满天飞，还派出工作组“揪后台，抓主谋”。贫下中农毫不妥协，他们说：“追后台都有一份，抓主谋是大伙的意见。”在走资派组织“斗争”贫农教师孙永海同志时，扛过活的老贫农夏德有反问他们：“林副主席号召全国人民学习毛主席著作，教师传播毛泽东思想有什么罪？”问得工作组哑口无言。经过这场斗争的考验，学校没有垮，学生没有散。
    斗争锤炼了贫下中农忠于毛主席、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红心；斗争也激发起革命师生更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。革命师生把学习“老三篇”和《毛主席语录》作为主课。同时以彻底革命精神，大破烦琐的、学非所用的修正主义教材，开设阶级斗争教育课、生产劳动课、军事训练课、珠算课、卫生知识课。
      培　养　什　么　人？
    是把学生培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，还是把学生变成脱离政治，脱离劳动，脱离贫下中农的精神贵族？这是两个阶级、两条教育路线的斗争焦点。
    贫下中农最厌恶肩不能担、手不能提的书生、少爷。因此，队办小学一成立，就拨给一垧二亩“育人田”，是学生的劳动基地，也是防修反修的战场。学生在“育人田”里学习阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的本领。
    正当学生在“育人田”大搞科学实验，培育良种，热火朝天干起来的时候，旧地委党内一小撮走资派匆匆忙忙派来了一个工作组，他们一来就下达指示：“学生小，知识少，不能搞科学实验，种地把学生累坏了。”走资派在上边叫，牛鬼蛇神就在下边跳，胡说什么：“一帮毛孩子能搞出个啥名堂，还不如把地扔了。要是干活，还让孩子念书干啥。”他们遥相呼应，一唱一和。可是贫下中农心里明白，他们既不是心疼学生，又不是怕把地扔了，而是破坏毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。遵照毛主席“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥”的教导，贫下中农针对这些言行，开展了对修正主义教育制度的大控诉、大批判。一位老贫农说：“我有两个孩子，大的人家说‘笨’，被学校推出来了；二的没想到越念书越不成器，到家锹镐不动，这叫啥学校？”通过深刻的揭露和有力的批判，使队办小学坚决地走上了教育与生产劳动相结合的道路。
    这所队办小学的成长和壮大，充分地证明伟大领袖毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的指示无比英明，完全说明了队办小学是新生事物，每前进一步都会遭到阶级敌人的破坏和资产阶级教育路线的“围剿”，只有敢于斗争，敢于胜利，才能使民办小学在贫下中农中间生根、开花、结果。
