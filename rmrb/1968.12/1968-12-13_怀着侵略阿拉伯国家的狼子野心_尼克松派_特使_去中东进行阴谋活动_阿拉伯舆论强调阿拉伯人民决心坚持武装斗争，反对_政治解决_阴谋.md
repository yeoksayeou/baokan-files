To further extend the black hand of American imperialism in the Middle East and implement its policy of aggression, the newly "elected" U.S. President Nixon dispatched William Scranton as a "special envoy" to the Middle East for eight days of conspiratorial activities from December 4 to 11.

Scranton first went to Iran, then to Lebanon, the United Arab Republic, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. Finally, he rushed to the U.S. stronghold of aggression in the Middle East, Israel, and after secret talks with the Israeli leaders, returned to the U.S. to report to Nixon.

Scranton was sent to the Middle East to engage in activities at a time when the national liberation movement in the Middle East was flourishing, and when U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism were both intensifying their collusion and struggle to redivide the world in the Middle East. During his election campaign, Nixon made numerous statements advocating for increased expansion and aggression in the Middle East, as well as support for Israel's aggression. After being "elected" president, he immediately dispatched Scranton to the Middle East, which clearly showed the strong ambitions of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East.

Scranton's activities in the Middle East also revealed this. He claimed that Nixon had a "great and deep interest" in the Middle East.

Scranton's activities indicated that the United States would continue to pursue imperialist policies in the Middle East, supporting its tool, Israel, in continuing its aggression against Arab countries. According to the Associated Press, during his talks with Israeli "Foreign Minister" Eban, Scranton explained the "stability and consistency" of the U.S. attitude towards Israel and expressed that "Washington's major policy principles would not change."

Scranton vigorously peddled the U.S. imperialist's so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem. In his talks with reporters, he portrayed the U.S.-Soviet collusion in concocting the United Nations Security Council's 1967 November resolution on the Middle East problem and the activities of the United Nations "special envoy" Jarring as the "most appropriate way to resolve the current crisis." On his way back to the U.S. from the Middle East, passing through Rome, he also revealed that the Nixon administration would formulate a so-called Middle East "peace plan." This shows that the U.S. imperialists will collude with the Soviet revisionists to continue playing the trick of the so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem, attempting to force Arab countries to submit and abandon their just struggle against Israeli aggression.

Arab countries' public opinion exposed the true nature of Scranton's "mission." The Damascus Radio Station in Syria said that Scranton's "mission" would "only pave the way for the United States to exert new pressures on Arab countries after Nixon takes office next January, forcing them to submit to the conditions proposed by Israel."

The Damascus Radio Station also pointed out in a commentary that while Scranton and Jarring were active in the Middle East, Israel launched new attacks on Jordan, which was "part of the diplomatic and military pressure exerted by the United States and Zionists on the Arabs to erase the Palestinian issue." The commentary emphasized that the Arab people are determined to oppose all "political solution" conspiracies and intensify the armed struggle for liberation.

The Iraqi newspaper *Al-Nur* commented that Scranton was making his "visit" to the Middle East at a time when U.S. imperialism had decided to provide Israel with "Ghost" aircraft and was intensifying its conspiracies against the Arab people. The commentary exposed that Scranton's trip to the Middle East was to "impose the imperialists' solution to the Middle East problem on us." The commentary said: "Our answer to Scranton is: It's impossible! Everyone says it's impossible!"

    怀着侵略阿拉伯国家的狼子野心
    尼克松派“特使”去中东进行阴谋活动
    阿拉伯舆论强调阿拉伯人民决心坚持武装斗争，反对“政治解决”阴谋
    新华社十二日讯 为了在中东地区进一步伸展美帝国主义的黑手，推行侵略政策，新“当选”的美国总统尼克松派遣威廉·斯克兰顿作为“特使”，从十二月四日至十一日，到中东地区进行了八天的阴谋活动。
    斯克兰顿先到伊朗，接着去黎巴嫩、阿联、沙特阿拉伯和约旦。最后，他跑到美国在中东的侵略基地以色列，在同以色列的头目密商后，回美国向尼克松汇报。
    斯克兰顿是在中东民族解放运动蓬勃发展、美帝和苏修妄图重新瓜分世界在中东加紧互相勾结又互相争夺的背景下，被派到中东去活动的。尼克松在竞选时发表了许多主张加紧向中东进行扩张和侵略活动以及支持以色列侵略的言论。他“当选”总统后，立即派斯克兰顿到中东去，这表明了美帝国主义对中东的强烈野心。
    斯克兰顿在中东的阴谋活动中也透露了这一点。他声称，尼克松对于中东“有着巨大的、深切的兴趣”。
    斯克兰顿的活动表明，美国要继续在中东推行帝国主义政策，支持它的工具以色列继续对阿拉伯国家进行侵略。据美联社报道，斯克兰顿在同以色列“外长”埃班会谈时，说明了“美国对以色列态度的稳定性和一贯性”，并且表示“华盛顿的大的政策原则将不会改变”。
    斯克兰顿大肆兜售美帝所谓“政治解决”中东问题的骗局。他在对记者谈话中，把美苏合谋炮制的联合国安理会一九六七年十一月关于中东问题的“决议”和联合国“特使”雅林的活动，说成是“解决目前危机的最合适的办法”。他在从中东回美国途中经过罗马时还透露，尼克松政府将制订一项所谓中东“和平计划”。这说明，美帝将同苏修勾结继续玩弄所谓“政治解决”中东问题的阴谋，妄图迫使阿拉伯国家就范，放弃反对以色列侵略的正义斗争。
    阿拉伯国家的舆论揭露了斯克兰顿“使命”的实质。叙利亚大马士革电台说，斯克兰顿的“使命”，“将只是为美国在尼克松于明年一月当政后对阿拉伯国家施加新的一系列压力铺平道路，来迫使它们屈从以色列提出的解决条件”。
    大马士革电台还在一篇评论中指出，在斯克兰顿和雅林到中东活动的同时，以色列对约旦发动了新的侵袭，这是“美国和犹太复国主义者对阿拉伯人施加的外交和军事压力的一个部分，以便勾销巴勒斯坦问题”。评论强调说，阿拉伯人民决心反对一切“政治解决”阴谋，加紧争取解放的武装斗争。
    伊拉克《光明报》在评论中说，斯克兰顿是在这样的时刻到中东进行“访问”的，那就是美帝国主义已决定向以色列提供“鬼怪式”飞机和正在加紧进行反对阿拉伯人民的阴谋活动。评论揭露，斯克兰顿的中东之行是要“把帝国主义者的（中东问题）解决办法强加给我们”。评论说：“我们回答斯克兰顿的只是办不到！大家一致说办不到！”
