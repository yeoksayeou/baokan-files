President Sekou Toure recently denounced the destructive activities of imperialism and its lackeys against African countries at a rally in Conakry.

On December 18, Toure addressed several hundred officers and soldiers of the Guinea People's Army's Conakry garrison at the People's Palace, stating that due to imperialism's rule, exploitation, and humiliation of Africa, Africa remembers imperialism's cruelty, lack of morality, evil, inhumanity, and opposition to progress.

In his speech, Toure specifically condemned French imperialism's attempts to maintain its rule over former colonies. Toure said, "The struggle we are waging is not just our struggle; it is the struggle of all Africa." "The struggle between Africa and imperialism is one that should mobilize all conscious Africans."

Toure pointed out that imperialism is active in every country, even in Guinea, where it has some of its servants.

President Toure called on the military and the people to remain united and vigilant at all times, ready to punish the enemy and crush all conspirators.

    十二月十八日，杜尔总统在人民宫对参加集会的几内亚人民军科纳克里卫戍部队的几百名军官和士兵说，由于帝国主义统治、剥削和侮辱过非洲，非洲记住了帝国主义的残忍、没有道德、邪恶、非人道和反对进步的特性。
    杜尔在讲话中指名谴责法帝国主义试图维持它对前殖民地的统治。杜尔说：“我们所进行的斗争，不单纯是我们的斗争，它是全非洲的斗争。”“非洲和帝国主义之间的斗争是一场应把一切自觉的非洲人动员起来的斗争。”
    杜尔指出，帝国主义在每个国家都有活动，甚至在几内亚也有它的一些仆从。
    杜尔总统号召军人和人民永远团结和保持警惕，准备随时惩罚敌人，粉碎一切阴谋分子。
