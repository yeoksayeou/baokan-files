After studying the letter to the editor in *People's Daily* titled "Suggesting All Public Primary Schools Be Transferred to the Management of Production Brigades," we found it very enlightening. After multiple discussions and seeking opinions from various sides, we believe that having factories in cities run primary schools aligns with the direction of socialist development. It also ensures the complete implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions that "the working class must lead everything" and "to achieve a proletarian educational revolution, leadership by the working class and participation by the working masses are essential." The benefits of this approach are as follows:

1. **Fundamentally solving the issue of leadership.** If primary schools in cities are run by nearby factories, the schools will be directly led by the factories. Schools will become organizations equivalent to workshops, allowing factory leaders to appoint excellent workers to lead the schools. The working masses can directly participate in the educational revolution of the schools, ensuring that all power is firmly in the hands of the working class.

2. **The working class can cultivate their most reliable successors according to the needs of the proletarian revolutionary cause.** If primary schools in cities are run by factories, Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" can be fully implemented. This will allow the revolutionary successors to be trained from a young age in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, truly becoming socialist-conscious, cultured laborers.

3. **Facilitating the re-education of teachers by the working class.** If factories run schools, the working class will not only be in an absolute numerical majority but also hold absolute advantages in political and ideological aspects. If primary schools in cities are run by factories, a large number of teachers can frequently participate in collective production labor, gradually becoming new types of intellectuals who can both work and teach.

4. **Factories running schools, workers taking the lectern, and teachers and students engaging in workshop labor can implement Chairman Mao's important directive that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." This will gradually narrow the gap between mental and manual labor.**

5. **Schools were originally pure consumption units. If factories run them, schools can gradually transform into semi-consumption units, saving the state a large amount of investment and benefiting socialist construction.**

Based on the distribution of primary schools and factories in cities, we believe it is feasible for nearby factories to run schools. Some schools and factories are separated by just a wall, while others are only a few minutes' walk away. Whether this initiative is correct remains to be seen in practice.

### 工厂办小学符合社会主义大方向

    工厂办小学符合社会主义大方向
    学习了《人民日报》革命群众来信“建议所有公办小学下放到大队来办”后，很有启发。经过多次的讨论，征求了多方面的意见，我们认为，城市小学由工厂来办，符合社会主义发展的方向，并且能够不折不扣地落实毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”和“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的伟大教导。这样做的好处是：
    一、从根本上解决了领导权的问题。城市小学由附近工厂来办，学校就直接由工厂领导。学校成为相当于车间一级的组织，厂领导可选派优秀工人担任学校的领导工作，工人群众就可直接参加学校的教育革命，学校的一切大权就可直接地、牢固地掌握在工人阶级手里。
    二、工人阶级可以按照无产阶级革命事业的需要，直接培养自己的最可靠的接班人。城市小学由工厂来办，就能坚决地、全面地落实毛主席的“五·七”指示，使革命的下一代从小就能在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中得到锻炼，使他们真正地成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    三、有利于教师接受工人阶级的再教育。如果由工厂办学校，工人阶级不但在人数上占了绝对优势，而且在政治思想等各方面均占绝对优势。城市小学由工厂来办，广大教师还能经常参加集体生产劳动，使他们逐渐成为又能做工，又能教书的新型知识分子。
    四、城市小学由工厂办，工人走上讲台，教员、学生下车间劳动，就可实现毛主席关于“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的重要指示，从而逐步地缩小脑力劳动同体力劳动的差别。
    五、学校原来是一个纯粹的消费单位，由工厂来办校，学校就能逐步转化为一个半消费单位，可以节约国家大量投资，有利于社会主义建设。
    根据城市小学和工厂分布情况，我们认为由附近工厂来办学是做得到的。有些学校和工厂仅仅一墙之隔，有的走几分钟的路就行了。这倡议是否正确，有待实践。
