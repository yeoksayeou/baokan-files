The industrial front in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, is presenting a new leap forward. The city has completed this year's national industrial production plan ahead of schedule by one month and seven days.

According to Xinhua News Agency from Shijiazhuang on the 7th, the working class of Shijiazhuang City, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, fully implements Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and resolutely carries out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." This has brought about an unprecedented leap forward in the industrial front. The city has completed this year's national industrial production plan ahead of schedule by one month and seven days, with the total industrial output value increasing by 27.3% compared to the same period last year. The production of 48 major products, including cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyed fabric, coal, steel, antibiotics, and tractor parts, has all seen significant increases compared to the same period last year. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The working class of Shijiazhuang City, with their deep proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty for the great leader Chairman Mao, respond to every new instruction from Chairman Mao and every battle order from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and resolutely execute them. This is the fundamental guarantee for their achievements in both revolution and production. The broad masses of workers firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," and under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, they insist on fighting class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, using revolution to lead production, making the revolutionary and production situation in each factory and mine better and better. Currently, under the great inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of workers are seriously studying Chairman Mao's brilliant report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, seriously carrying out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, further raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and striving for greater victories in both revolution and production.

Over the past year, in the great struggle of "grasp revolution, promote production," the working class of Shijiazhuang City has persistently and thoroughly carried out revolutionary criticism, cleansing the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents. They have also combined revolutionary criticism with the cleanup of class ranks and various tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses, and effectively promoting the development of revolution and production.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, while seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party, the working class of Shijiazhuang City also removed those bourgeois technical "authorities" from their positions, taking control of the production and technical leadership of factories and enterprises. With the arrival of the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, a magnificent wave of mass technical innovation and technological revolution has surged, creating a large number of new processes, new technologies, and new products that those bourgeois technical "authorities" had never even dared to imagine. The city has achieved more than 2,000 technological revolutions and innovations in just half a year. (Accompanying photo)

The revolutionary workers of Shijiazhuang Cotton Mill No. 3 have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production, making production present a new look, and completing the annual national production plan ahead of schedule by 39 days, creating the highest production level since the factory's establishment. This is a report of revolutionary and production double victories to the great leader Chairman Mao by the revolutionary workers in the weaving workshop, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm.

    石家庄市的工人阶级，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱和无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，对毛主席的每一个最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都闻风而动，坚决执行，这是他们取得革命和生产双胜利的根本保证。广大工人群众牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在各级革命委员会的领导下，坚持狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，以革命统帅生产，使各厂矿的革命和生产形势越来越好。目前，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，广大工人群众正在认真学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的光辉报告，认真开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。
    一年来，在“抓革命，促生产”的伟大斗争中，石家庄市工人阶级坚持深入持久地开展革命大批判，肃清叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，并且把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍以及斗、批、改的各项工作紧密结合起来，极大地提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，有力地促进了革命和生产的发展。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，石家庄市工人阶级在夺党内一小撮走资派的权的同时，也把那些资产阶级技术“权威”赶下了台，掌握了厂矿企业的生产技术领导大权，并且随着斗、批、改高潮的到来，掀起了一个波澜壮阔的群众性技术革新和技术革命的高潮，创造了大量为那些资产阶级技术“权威”过去想都不敢想的新工艺、新技术、新产品，全市只半年的时间内就实现了两千多项技术革命和技术革新。（附图片）
