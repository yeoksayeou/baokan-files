Party branch deputy secretary and militia company political instructor Guo Fenglian said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "To seize victory nationwide is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li. ... China's revolution is great, but the road ahead after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and we must ensure that comrades continue to maintain a humble, cautious, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and we must ensure that comrades continue to maintain a hardworking attitude." Chairman Mao's words were spoken nineteen years ago, and we have studied them countless times. Now, studying them again, it still feels as if Chairman Mao was speaking about today's situation. I am a young cadre and must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings about the long road ahead, the greater work, and the more arduous struggle. I must strive in the two "musts," achieving humility in the face of success and fearlessness in the face of hardship, living to execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and dying to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Brigade accountant Zhao Suheng said: Chairman Mao's teaching that "we can learn things we did not previously understand. We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world" has deeply educated me every time I study it. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have relied on studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought to destroy an old, impoverished Dazhai and build a new, socialist Dazhai. We have destroyed the labor management system of work points and material incentives pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and created a new labor management system of political leadership and public service. We have learned many things we did not previously understand, greatly liberating our minds. In the upcoming struggle, criticism, and reform, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, fully implement the various combat tasks proposed in the CPC Central Committee's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session, continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly settle the accounts of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes, raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, stand guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and keep watch.

    在成绩面前  继续保持不骄不躁的作风
    党支部副书记、民兵连指导员郭凤莲说：毛主席教导我们：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”毛主席这段话已经讲过十九年了，我们学过无数次，现在再重新学习，还觉得毛主席是针对今天的情况讲的一样。我是个青年干部，一定要牢牢记住毛主席关于以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦的教导，一定要在两个“务必”上下功夫，做到成绩面前不骄傲，困难面前不怕苦，生为执行毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    大队会计赵素恒说：毛主席关于“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的教导，我学一次受一次深刻的教育。我们大寨贫下中农就是靠活学活用毛泽东思想，破坏了一个旧大寨、穷大寨，建设起一个社会主义的新大寨。我们破坏了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的工分挂帅、物质刺激的旧的劳动管理制度，创造了政治挂帅、一心为公的新的劳动管理制度。许许多多原来不懂的东西我们学会了，大大解放了思想。在今后的斗、批、改中，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，全面落实党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，继续深入开展革命大批判，彻底清算刘少奇及其同伙的反革命修正主义罪行，把两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，为毛主席的革命路线站好岗，放好哨。
