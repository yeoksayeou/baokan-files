The Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee recently issued a statement strongly condemning the recent intensified bombing of Lao liberation zones by U.S. imperialism.

The statement emphasized that this clearly shows that U.S. imperialism is unwilling to abandon its aggression against Laos. The U.S. intensification of bombing in Laos does not indicate its strength. The U.S.'s mad actions will only further isolate itself and strengthen the Lao people's resolve to defeat U.S. imperialism. The statement said: "No matter how many difficulties and sacrifices the Lao military and people's just struggle will encounter, they will persist in their patriotic struggle to achieve a thorough victory over U.S. imperialism and its lackeys."

According to the Pathet Lao News Agency, in just the first 22 days of November, including B-52 aircraft, U.S. bandit planes bombed the entire Lao liberation zone more than 10,000 times, dropping nearly 14,000 explosive bombs and a large number of napalm and fragmentation bombs.

The above war actions by U.S. imperialism have aroused the extreme anger of the Lao people. They strongly condemn the new acts of aggression committed by U.S. imperialism against the Lao people.

According to the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Lao Patriotic Forces in Udomsai County, Luang Prabang Province, on November 30, captured the bandit base in the Banfa area near the Nambo Valley, killing 38 enemy soldiers, wounding many, and seizing 30 weapons and a large amount of military supplies, including three mortars and three recoilless rifles. The Patriotic Forces have liberated the entire Banfa area.

The report said that since the great victory in Nambo in January this year, the U.S. and its lackeys have tried to turn the Banfa, Longzhu, and Kanya areas near the Nambo Valley into a springboard for infiltrating and subversive activities against the liberation zones. The liberation of the Banfa area is a major blow to the plots of the U.S. and its lackeys.

According to another report, the patriotic military and people of Xieng Khouang Province bravely counterattacked the "infiltration" attacks launched by the U.S. and its lackeys on the Zongshan, Nandai, Xatungnu, Xatungdei areas and the surrounding areas of Baty in November, killing 128 enemy soldiers and shooting down one U.S. plane. The patriotic forces in Houaphan Province bravely counterattacked the enemy's air raids and ground attacks in November, shooting down four U.S. planes and annihilating more than 70 enemy soldiers.

According to the Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, the patriotic military and people of central and southern Laos bravely fought in November, causing the U.S. imperialism and its lackeys' air raids and ground "infiltration" attacks on the liberation zones to suffer heavy defeats. According to incomplete statistics, the patriotic military and people of central and southern Laos killed nearly 500 enemy soldiers this month, including 319 killed, shot down and destroyed 19 U.S. bandit planes, and damaged dozens more.

According to another broadcast, the patriotic military and people of southern Laos, in the six months of the rainy season this year, continuously struck the enemy, killing a total of 1,532 enemy soldiers, including 878 killed (including one captain of the right-wing Lao army), and shooting down 31 U.S. planes.

The patriotic military and people of Xieng Khouang Province have been actively suppressing bandits from January to October this year. According to incomplete statistics, they have annihilated 756 bandits, including 375 killed. At the same time, they have liberated dozens of villages.

According to the Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, the Lao patriotic military recently shot down and destroyed 13 U.S. bandit planes, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism.

The radio said that on November 6, the patriotic military and people of Savannakhet Province shot down eight U.S. helicopters, on November 16, the patriotic military and people of Attapeu Province shot down three U.S. helicopters, on November 29, the local forces and guerrillas of Bolikhamxai Province destroyed one U.S. plane, and on November 30, the patriotic military and people of Xieng Khouang Province shot down one U.S. helicopter.

According to the Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, the patriotic military and people of Tadeng County, Saravane Province, recently took the initiative to attack and annihilated more than 100 enemy soldiers.

The radio said that in recent days, the enemy frequently dispatched troops stationed in Tadeng County to brutally "sweep" and suppress the residents around the county. The patriotic military and people of Tadeng County, in order to protect the lives and property of the people and severely punish the enemy, launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Tadeng County from the night of November 26 to 27. They killed 50 enemy soldiers on the spot and seized and destroyed a large number of weapons and military supplies.

In order to rescue their failure, the U.S. imperialism and its lackeys dispatched another batch of troops to rescue them on November 28, but they were intercepted and bravely attacked by the local forces, militia, guerrillas, and people of Tadeng County on the way. The patriotic military and people killed 38 enemy soldiers in the interception, captured 13, and destroyed two enemy vehicles, seizing many weapons.

In a fit of rage, the enemy, in order to rescue the fleeing enemy troops, dispatched planes to bomb the above-mentioned areas indiscriminately, but the bombs killed and wounded many fleeing enemy troops.

    新华社康开六日电  据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近以来疯狂加紧轰炸老挝解放区的侵略罪行。
    声明强调指出，这清楚地表明，美帝国主义不肯放弃它对老挝的侵略阴谋。美国加紧轰炸老挝并不表明它的强大。美国的疯狂行动只会使自己进一步陷于孤立，并使老挝人民增强战胜美帝的决心。声明说：“不管老挝军民的正义斗争会遇到怎样的艰难险阻和牺牲，他们将坚持他们的爱国斗争，以便取得对美帝及其走狗的彻底胜利。”
    据巴特寮通讯社揭露，仅在十一月头二十二天里，包括B—52型飞机在内的美国强盗飞机就对整个老挝解放区轰炸共一万多架次，投下了近一万四千枚爆破炸弹和大量的凝固汽油弹和杀伤炸弹。
    美帝国主义的上述战争行动，激起了老挝人民的无比愤怒。他们纷纷强烈谴责美帝国主义对老挝人民犯下的新的侵略罪行。
    新华社康开七日电据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝琅勃拉邦省乌多姆塞县爱国武装力量十一月三十日攻克了南博山谷附近班法地区的匪徒基地，打死敌人三十八名，打伤许多敌人，缴获武器三十件以及大批军用物资，其中包括迫击炮三门和无后座力炮三门。爱国武装力量收复了整个班法地区。
    报道说，自今年一月的南博大捷之后，美帝及其走狗就力图把南博山谷附近的班法、龙竹和坎牙地区变成向解放区进行蚕食进攻和颠覆活动的跳板。爱国武装力量收复班法地区是对美帝及其走狗的阴谋的一个重大打击。
    另据报道，桑怒省爱国军民十一月份英勇反击美帝及其走狗对宗山、南迪、沙吞怒、沙吞代地区和巴提周围地区发动的“蚕食”进攻，共歼敌一百二十八名，击落美机一架。川圹省爱国武装力量十一月份英勇反击敌人的空中袭击和地面进攻，击落美机四架，歼灭敌军七十多名。
    新华社康开九日电据巴特寮电台广播，老挝中、下寮爱国军民在十一月份勇敢战斗，使美帝国主义及其走狗对解放区的空中袭击和地面“蚕食”进攻遭到了惨重的失败。据不完全统计，中、下寮爱国军民在这个月里共歼灭敌人近五百名，其中打死三百一十九名，击落击毁美国强盗飞机十九架，击伤数十架。
    另据广播，下寮爱国军民在今年雨季的六个月内，连续打击敌人，共歼灭敌人一千五百三十二名，其中打死八百七十八名（包括老挝右派军队营长一名），击落美机三十一架。
    上寮桑怒省爱国军民从今年一月到十月积极剿匪，据不完全统计，共歼灭匪徒七百五十六名，其中打死三百七十五名。同时解放数十个村庄。
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国军民最近共击落击毁美国强盗飞机十三架，给美帝国主义以沉重打击。

    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝沙拉湾省塔当县的爱国军民最近主动出击，歼灭敌人一百多名。
    电台说，最近以来，敌人经常出动他们驻扎在塔当县城的军队对这个县城周围的居民进行野蛮的“扫荡”和镇压。塔当县的爱国军民为了保卫人民的生命财产和严惩敌人，在十一月二十六日到二十七日凌晨猛烈袭击了塔当县城的敌人。他们当场打死敌人五十名，并且缴获和击毁大批武器和军用物资。
    美帝国主义及其走狗为了挽救他们的失败，在十一月二十八日又抽调一批军队前来救援，但在途中就遭到了塔当县地方部队、民兵游击队和人民的英勇截击。爱国军民在截击中一举打死敌人三十八名，俘虏十三名，并且击毁敌人军车两辆，缴获许多武器。
    气急败坏的敌人，为了救援溃散的敌军，又出动飞机对上述地区狂轰滥炸，但炸弹却炸死炸伤许多溃散的敌军。
