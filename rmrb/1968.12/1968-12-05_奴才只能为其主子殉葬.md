The Japanese reactionaries, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, are accelerating their economic and military buildup, hastening the full-scale revival of Japanese militarism. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun* revealed that from April to September this year, the value of military supplies sold by Japan to foreign countries increased by 19% compared to the same period last year, setting a new record since the end of the Korean War in 1953. This indicates the arrogance of the Japanese reactionaries, led by people like Sato Eisaku, and deserves serious attention from the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia.

After the Second World War, Japan's economy was tightly bound to the U.S. war chariot, dependent on the United States. U.S. imperialism, in order to turn Japan into a bridgehead for its aggression against Asia, vigorously aided Japan in developing its military industry and hastening the revival of Japanese militarism. The Japanese reactionaries actively served U.S. imperialism in implementing its policy of encircling Asia with China as the core. Since Sato Eisaku came to power four years ago, the Sato government, based on the "second military expansion plan" formulated under the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," hastily concocted a "third military expansion plan." The total military expenditure of this plan is equivalent to twice the military expenditure of the second plan and equivalent to the total military expenditure of Japan over the past fifteen years. Through these military expansion plans, Japan has established an "industry and military combined system" and is "prepared to adapt to war at any time." Currently, Japan has established a complete military-industrial system capable of producing aircraft, missiles, tanks, warships, and other weapons. A small clique of big financial tycoons monopolizes the production of Japanese weapons and military machinery, using state funds to develop military production and seize excessive profits. Since the war, Japan, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, has been playing the role of a "military factory" for U.S. aggression in Asia.

In recent years, the Sato reactionary government, in order to assist U.S. imperialism in slaughtering the Vietnamese people, has eagerly provided various weapons, ammunition, napalm, chemical poisons, and many military supplies to the invading U.S. forces in Vietnam. Aircraft, warships, tanks, and artillery damaged by the heroic Vietnamese military and people in the U.S. invasion of Vietnam are also sent to Japan for repair. The benefits Japan has gained from the Vietnam War, just from the "special military supplies" alone, amount to twenty billion dollars each year. The Japanese reactionaries also actively export weapons, industrial equipment for weapon production, and various military supplies to South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, using them to suppress revolutionary struggles in various regions.

Now, the Sato reactionary government, on the one hand, is increasingly providing military weapons and supplies to the reactionaries of various countries in Southeast Asia, and on the other hand, is strengthening the strength of Japan's land, sea, and air "Self-Defense Forces." Under the command of U.S. imperialism, the strength of Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" has now reached over 250,000 people, and with the reserve army, it has 750,000 people. They are equipped with Hawk surface-to-air missiles, tanks, submarines, and various modern weapons. The scale and strength of these forces have long since surpassed the peacetime level of the old Japanese militarism.

U.S. imperialism is hastening the revival of Japanese militarism, with its main target being socialist China. At the same time, it has its own plans. Recently, the Sato reactionary government, on the one hand, proposed a so-called "Asia-Pacific Circle" plan, scheming to occupy more of the commodity and raw material markets in this region; on the other hand, taking the opportunity of the so-called "100th anniversary of Meiji," it is vigorously propagating the so-called "great power consciousness" and "spirit of defending the motherland," etc. This fully shows that the Japanese militarists are still dreaming of the old "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." They harbor the wolfish ambition of returning to power, dreaming of following in the footsteps of U.S. imperialism to run rampant in Asia.

However, history will not repeat itself, and the tide of the world has already changed. Today, the people of the world are generally awakened, and the world revolution has entered a great new era. The closer the Japanese reactionaries follow their masters, the closer they are to their graves. The development of history will prove the correctness of the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Slaves who follow U.S. imperialism loyally will, in the end, only be buried with U.S. imperialism."

The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with new and old grievances, are closely watching the aggressive moves of U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries. We will resolutely fight side by side with the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and strive to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without an exploitative system.

    奴才只能为其主子殉葬
    解放军某部战士　万山红
    日本反动派在美帝国主义扶植下，正在加速经济军事化，加快全面复活日本军国主义的步伐。日本资产阶级报纸《每日新闻》透露：今年四月到九月，日本向外国出售军需品的数字，比上一年同期增长百分之十九，创朝鲜战争最后一年——一九五三年以来的最高纪录。这说明了以佐藤荣作之流为代表的日本反动派的猖狂，值得引起中国人民和亚洲各国人民的严重注意。
    第二次世界大战以后，日本的经济被紧紧地绑在美国的战车上，依附于美国。美帝国主义为了把日本变为自己侵略亚洲的桥头堡，竭力帮助日本发展军事工业，加速复活日本军国主义势力。日本反动派又积极为美帝国主义推行包围以中国为核心的侵略亚洲的政策效劳。自从四年前佐藤荣作上台后，在根据日美“安全条约”制定的“第二次扩军计划”的基础上，佐藤政府又迫不及待地编造了“第三次扩军计划”。这项计划的军费总额相当于第二次计划的军费的两倍，相当于过去十五年日本军费的总和。经过这几个扩军计划，日本已经建立起“产业和军队结合的体制”，并“做好随时适应战事的体制准备”。目前日本已经建立起可以生产飞机、导弹、坦克、军舰等完整的军火工业体系。一小撮大财阀集中地垄断了日本武器和军用机械的生产，利用国家费用发展军火生产攫取超额利润。战后以来，日本在美帝的扶植下，起着美帝侵略亚洲的“军火工厂”的作用。
    近几年来，佐藤反动政府为了配合美帝国主义屠杀越南人民，卖力地向侵越美军提供各种武器、弹药、凝固汽油弹、化学毒药和许多军用物资。美国侵略军在侵越战争中被英雄的越南军民打坏了的飞机、军舰、坦克、大炮等也运到日本修理。日本从侵越战争中所得到的好处，仅“特别军需”一项，每年就多达二十亿美元。日本反动派还积极向南朝鲜、泰国、菲律宾，以及蒋介石匪帮输出武器、制造武器的工业设备和各种军需物资，用于镇压各地区人民的革命斗争。
    现在，佐藤反动政府一方面越来越多地向东南亚各国反动派提供军火和军需物资，一方面加强日本陆、海、空“自卫队”的实力。在美帝指挥下，目前日本“自卫队”的兵力已达二十五万多人，再加上后备军，就有七十五万人。配备有隼式地对空导弹、坦克、潜艇及各种现代化武器装备。这些军队的规模和实力，早已远远越过旧日本军国主义时代平时的水平。
    美帝国主义加紧扶植日本军国主义势力，其主要矛头是指向社会主义中国的。同时也有它自己的打算的。最近，佐藤反动政府一面提出了一个所谓“亚洲太平洋圈”的计划，阴谋更多地占领这个地区的商品市场和原料市场；一面借着所谓“明治一百周年”的机会，大肆宣传所谓“大国意识”和“保卫祖国的气概”等等。这就充分表明日本军国主义者的脑子里还在做着当年“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。他们怀着卷土重来的狼子野心，梦想跟在美帝国主义的屁股后面，在亚洲横行霸道。
    但是历史决不会重演，世界的潮流早已经变了。今天，世界各国人民普遍觉醒，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。日本反动派跟它的主子跟得越紧，离它的坟墓就越近。历史的发展必将证明我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”
    中国人民和中国人民解放军怀着新仇旧恨，密切注视着美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的一切侵略动向，坚决同日本人民、亚洲各国人民战斗在一起，为打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗。
