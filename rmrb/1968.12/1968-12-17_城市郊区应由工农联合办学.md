Our factory is located in the Dong Industrial Zone of Fuzhou City. This area was originally rural, but now there are many factories, with people's communes' fields in front of and behind the factories. The primary schools near our factory are mostly attended by children of workers and farmers.

In places where workers and farmers live together, it may not be suitable or feasible for schools to be run solely by the factory or the production brigade. It would be more appropriate for these primary schools to be jointly managed by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. This would not only reflect the leadership of the working class but also involve poor and lower-middle peasants in school management; it would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and provide a comprehensive education for the students. If one or a few schools could have a military representative, it would be even better, as the students could fully implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" to "study not only books but also industry, agriculture, and military affairs."

    城市郊区应由工农联合办学
    我们工厂位于福州市东工业区。这里原是农村，现有很多工厂，厂前厂后是人民公社的田园。我们工厂附近的小学绝大多数是工农子女。
    象这样工农群众居住的地方，学校如果单靠工厂或者单靠生产大队来办，不一定合适，也有困难。这样的小学由工人和贫下中农联合管理比较合适。这既体现有工人阶级领导，又有贫下中农参加管理学校；既加强了工农联盟，又能全面地教育学生。如果一个学校或几个学校能有一名军代表，就更好了，学生就能完全做到毛主席“五·七”指示所说的那样，“不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军”。
