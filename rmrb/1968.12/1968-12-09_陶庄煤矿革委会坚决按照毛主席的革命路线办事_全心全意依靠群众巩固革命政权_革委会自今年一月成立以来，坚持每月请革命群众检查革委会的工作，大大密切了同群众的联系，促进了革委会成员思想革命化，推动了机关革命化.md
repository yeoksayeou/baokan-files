The Revolutionary Committee of Taozhuang Coal Mine resolutely follows Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, wholeheartedly relying on the masses to consolidate the revolutionary regime. Since its establishment in January this year, the Revolutionary Committee has insisted on inviting revolutionary masses to inspect its work every month, greatly enhancing its connection with the masses, promoting the thought revolutionization of the Revolutionary Committee members, and advancing the revolutionization of the organization.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 6th, the Revolutionary Committee of Taozhuang Coal Mine, Zaozhuang Mining Bureau, Shandong Province, firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teaching that "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee on January 26th this year, every 26th of the month, revolutionary masses are invited to inspect the work of the Revolutionary Committee, criticize and make suggestions for the work of the Revolutionary Committee, placing the newly born proletarian revolutionary regime under the supervision of the masses, and rooting it among the masses. Revolutionary miners excitedly said, "Now, the more than 5,000 revolutionary workers and more than 20,000 workers' families in our mine, everyone has become a non-commissioned member of the Revolutionary Committee, a non-director director!"

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Taozhuang Coal Mine, the People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine helped the Revolutionary Committee repeatedly study the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "winning nationwide victory, this is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li" and "to adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, be the students of the masses." They wholeheartedly rely on the masses to consolidate and develop the proletarian revolutionary regime. On February 26th, just one month after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they invited representatives of the revolutionary masses to hold a symposium to inspect the work of the Revolutionary Committee. At the meeting, many old miners excitedly said that in the past, the capitalist roaders usurped the power of our coal mine, executing the black goods of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and implementing the policy of control, restriction, and oppression on us workers. For more than a decade, we didn't even know which way the door of the capitalist roaders' office opened. Today, the Revolutionary Committee has just been established, and immediately invited the masses to discuss the major issues of the entire mine. This is truly following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, genuinely connecting with the masses! The words of the old workers gave the Revolutionary Committee director, who came from the workers, great inspiration. He deeply felt that the Revolutionary Committee must be placed under the criticism and supervision of the masses to forever advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the future, we should do this every month, every year, and always sincerely accept the criticism and supervision of the masses. He shared his thoughts with other members of the Revolutionary Committee, which received unanimous support. They decided to establish a system to invite revolutionary masses to inspect the work of the Revolutionary Committee every 26th of the month.

Over the past ten months of practice, it has been proven that the broad revolutionary masses are the true masters of the proletarian revolutionary regime. The more sincerely and humbly the Revolutionary Committee accepts the criticism and supervision of the masses, the more the broad revolutionary masses will cherish the newly born Revolutionary Committee. This monthly meeting to listen to the opinions of revolutionary masses quickly turned into a representative conference for revolutionary workers to exercise power and use power, into a study class to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, into a heart-to-heart meeting between the Revolutionary Committee members and revolutionary masses, and into a meeting to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. At the meeting on May 26th, workers from the thin coal seam mining face pointed out that recently, the leaders of the Revolutionary Committee had reduced their time working in the thin coal seam mining face. The Revolutionary Committee of the mine immediately held an executive meeting that night to inspect this issue. The next morning, the director of the Revolutionary Committee and the military representative took the lead in working in the thin coal seam, which was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary workers.

Not long after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Taozhuang Coal Mine, someone suggested installing a set of beautiful neon lights at the entrance of the mine club to show the new scene after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee. After this matter was known, old miners immediately sent two quotations from Chairman Mao to the Revolutionary Committee: "We must always maintain the style of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant and impetuous, and we must always maintain the style of hard struggle" and "to further economize and make revolution." The old miners pointed out bluntly: doing this kind of thing is to blacken the face of the Revolutionary Committee. This is not Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line. All members of the Revolutionary Committee immediately studied Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" with the old workers. The leaders of the Revolutionary Committee took the lead in exposing their shortcomings. Finally, not only was the plan to install neon lights canceled, but the full meeting of the Revolutionary Committee also passed a resolution on hard struggle and the revolutionization of work style, mobilizing all revolutionary workers in the mine to resolutely fight against the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemy.

Under the constant supervision and help of the revolutionary masses, the Revolutionary Committee of Taozhuang Coal Mine has greatly enhanced its awareness of implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They do everything according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and resolutely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Among the members of the Revolutionary Committee, the good practice of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and following the mass line has been formed. Every member of the Revolutionary Committee has made many worker friends, and the masses are willing to find them to solve problems. The members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply feel: "The masses can come to me to talk and solve problems, which is great. It shows that the masses trust us. We must not disappoint the hopes of the masses and must always be the confidants of the masses."

Now, when the Revolutionary Committee of this mine studies and implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions and researches major issues of the entire mine to promote revolution and production, they always invite a part of the workers, especially the old workers, to participate. Sometimes, they directly go to the workers to study and implement. After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Revolutionary Committee held more than ten days of expanded meetings to study the measures to implement the various tasks proposed by the plenary session. After the meeting, the director and the first deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee went to the East and West pits of this mine respectively to conduct in-depth investigations and solve old difficult problems according to the opinions raised by the workers at the meeting. The People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine also went to some key units to conduct investigations and research with the masses. At present, the mass worker amateur Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and amateur Mao Zedong Thought investigation teams are very active. Since this year, the mine has overfulfilled the national coal production plan every month. By October 20th, it had already completed the coal production equivalent to the entire year of the previous year.

    陶庄煤矿革委会坚决按照毛主席的革命路线办事
    全心全意依靠群众巩固革命政权
    革委会自今年一月成立以来，坚持每月请革命群众检查革委会的工作，大大密切了同群众的联系，促进了革委会成员思想革命化，推动了机关革命化
    据新华社济南六日电　山东枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿革命委员会牢记毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，在今年一月二十六日成立革命委员会后，每月二十六日都要请革命群众来检查革委会的工作，对革委会的工作提出批评和建议，使新生的无产阶级革命政权置于群众监督之下，扎根于群众之中。革命矿工激动地说：“如今，咱们矿五千多名革命职工、两万多名职工家属，人人都成了革委会里不当委员的委员，不当主任的主任了！”
    陶庄煤矿革命委员会成立之后，驻矿人民解放军就帮助革委会反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”和“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，全心全意地依靠群众来巩固和发展无产阶级革命政权。二月二十六日，革委会成立刚满一个月，他们就邀请革命群众的代表来开座谈会，检查革委会的工作。会上，许多老矿工激动地说，过去走资派篡夺了咱煤矿的大权，执行的是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的一套黑货，对咱们工人实行的是管、卡、压那一套。十几年来，走资派那办公室的大门朝那边开咱都摸不着。今天，革委会刚刚成立，马上把群众请来议论全矿的大事，这真是按毛主席的革命路线办事，真正和群众心连心！老工人的话给工人出身的革委会主任很大启发。他深刻地体会到，革命委员会一定要置于群众的批评和监督之下，才能永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。今后，我们应该月月这样搞，年年这样搞，永远老老实实地接受群众的批评和监督。他把自己的想法告诉革委会其他成员，得到了大家的一致支持。大家决定建立一项制度，每月二十六日请革命群众来检查革委会的工作。
    十个多月来的实践表明：广大革命群众是无产阶级革命政权真正的主人。革命委员会越是虚心诚恳地接受群众的批评和监督，广大革命群众就越是爱护新生的革命委员会。这种每月二十六日听取革命群众意见的大会，很快就变成了革命职工掌权、用权的代表大会，变成了落实毛主席最新指示的学习班，变成了革委会成员和革命群众的交心会和活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会。在五月二十六日的会议上，薄煤层采煤工作面上的工人在发言中提出最近矿革委会负责人到薄煤层工作面劳动的时间少了。矿革命委员会连夜召开常委会，检查了这个问题。第二天一早，革委会主任和军代表就带头下薄煤层劳动，受到广大革命职工的热烈欢迎。
    陶庄煤矿革委会成立后不久，有人主张在矿俱乐部门口安装一套漂亮的霓虹灯，表现革委会成立后的新景象。这件事被大家知道后，老矿工立即给革委会送来两条毛主席语录：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”和“要进一步节约闹革命”。老矿工们一针见血地指出：搞这一套玩艺儿，是往革委会脸上抹黑，这不是毛主席的革命路线，而是刘少奇的修正主义路线。革命委员会全体成员马上和老工人一道学习毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，革委会负责人带头亮私斗私。最后，不仅取消了安装霓虹灯的计划，革委会全体会议还通过了艰苦奋斗、实现思想作风革命化的决定，发动全矿革命职工，痛击阶级敌人糖衣炮弹的进攻。
    在革命群众的经常监督和帮助下，陶庄煤矿革命委员会大大提高了执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性，他们事事按照毛主席的革命路线办事，处处狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。在革委会成员中养成了相信群众、依靠群众、走群众路线的好风气。革委会的每个委员都交了不少工人朋友，群众有问题都愿意找他们。革委会的成员们深有体会地说：“群众能找我谈心，解决问题，这就太好了，表明群众信得过咱。咱们不能辜负群众的希望，就是要永远做群众的贴心人。”
    现在，这个矿的革委会在学习和贯彻毛主席的最新指示，研究全矿抓革命促生产的重大问题的时候，都要邀请一部分工人特别是老工人参加，有时候就直接到工人中去研究贯彻。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，革委会开了十多天扩大会议，研究了落实全会提出的各项任务的措施。会后，革委会主任和第一副主任就根据会上工人们提出的意见，分别到这个矿的东井和西井去深入调查研究，解决老大难问题。驻矿人民解放军也到一些重点单位，和群众一起大搞调查研究。目前，群众性的工人业余毛泽东思想宣传组和业余毛泽东思想调查小组十分活跃。今年以来，全矿月月超额完成国家煤炭生产计划，到十月二十日就已经完成了相当去年全年的煤炭产量。
