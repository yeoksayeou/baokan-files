	The revolutionary situation on the industrial and transportation fronts in Shaanxi and Ningxia is excellent, and production is booming. The broad revolutionary workers are determined to achieve even greater results in the new year.

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Xian, December 24 — The broad revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Shaanxi Province are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasping the revolution, and promoting production. The revolution is thriving, and production is booming. As early as October, a number of factories and mines in Shaanxi Province had completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule. Under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, industrial production in the entire province has again entered a new leap-forward stage. Major industrial products such as steel, crude oil, synthetic rubber, diesel engines, industrial enamel, printing machinery, and daily-use ceramics, totaling more than sixty varieties, have all completed or overfulfilled their annual production tasks. The production level of light industry and textile industry, which have completed their tasks relatively well, has increased quarter by quarter, with the total production value in the fourth quarter being 28 percent higher than in the third quarter. At the same time, the quality of the products has been greatly improved, and the variety of colors and types has been increasing.

	The broad revolutionary workers in Shaanxi Province unanimously believe that resolutely implementing the series of latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, earnestly carrying out the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines are the fundamental reasons for the achievements on the industrial and transportation fronts in the entire province. At present, they are using the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee as a weapon, summarizing the work of this year on one hand, and arranging the production tasks for 1969 on the other, determined to achieve even greater results in the new year.

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Yinchuan, December 24 — Under the guidance of the series of latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines of the 200,000 workers in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have greatly increased, and their enthusiasm for "grasp the revolution and promote production" has soared even higher. The industrial and transportation fronts in the entire region have presented an unprecedented excellent situation.

	Over the past year, the industrial production level in the entire region has increased month by month and quarter by quarter. The total output value of major industries such as building materials, textiles, light industry, metallurgy, and chemical industry has increased by 34 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and there has been a significant increase in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Since the second decade of November, a number of factories have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. Many factories have created the highest production level since their establishment. In the past, Ningxia did not produce Chairman Mao's works paper, electronic testing instruments, and nitrogenization equipment, but now they have been put into mass production or started production. In addition, some products have already reached the advanced level in the country or internationally.

	At present, the broad revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Ningxia are deeply carrying out the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, determined to achieve even greater results in the revolution and production, and to welcome the victory of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

    陕西省广大革命职工一致认为，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示，认真落实党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习，这是全省工业交通战线获得丰硕成果的根本原因。目前，他们以八届十二中全会公报为武器，一面总结今年的工作，一面着手安排一九六九年的生产任务，决心在新的一年里，创造出更加优异的成绩。

    一年来，全区工业生产水平一月高过一月，一季超过一季。建筑材料、纺织、轻工、冶金、化工等主要行业的总产值，第三季度比第二季度增长百分之三十四，第四季度又比第三季度有了大幅度的增长。从十一月上旬以来，已有一批工厂提前完成全年生产计划。许多工厂创造了建厂以来的最高生产水平。过去宁夏没有生产过的毛主席著作用纸、电子测试仪器和氮化设备等，如今已经大批投入生产或开始投入生产。另外，有些产品已经分别达到全国先进水平或国际先进水平。
