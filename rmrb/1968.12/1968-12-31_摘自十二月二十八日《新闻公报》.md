	China's latest hydrogen bomb test has been successful, striking another blow against the nuclear threats and blackmail policies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. This is a great encouragement and support for the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle to carry the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end, and for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.
