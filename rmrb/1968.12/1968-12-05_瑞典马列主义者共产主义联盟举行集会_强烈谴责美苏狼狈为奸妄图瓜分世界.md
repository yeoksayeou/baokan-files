The Swedish Marxist-Leninist Communist League held meetings in Gothenburg on November 30 and December 1, strongly condemning the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in their attempt to redivide the world.

At the meetings, leaders of the Swedish Marxist-Leninist Communist League delivered speeches. The reports stated that U.S. imperialism has launched an aggressive war against Vietnam and exploits and oppresses the working class in other countries around the world. U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world.

The report said that the Soviet revisionist leadership has restored capitalism domestically, exploiting and oppressing the working people, workers, and peasants, plunging them into misery.

The report said that in foreign policy, the Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed the policies of Lenin and Stalin. They have betrayed Lenin's policy of opposing the enemies of socialism and supporting the world revolutionary movement. The Soviet revisionist leadership, through providing loans, supported the Suharto-Nasution military fascist dictatorship that massacred tens of thousands of Indonesian Communist Party members and peace advocates. They supported the Indian reactionaries in their invasion of China and colluded with the Indian bourgeoisie to exploit the Indian proletariat. They also conducted deals with U.S. imperialism in the United Nations to suppress revolutionary movements in other countries.

The report said that the Soviet revisionist leadership opposes China's "People's Communes" and China's industrialization, tearing up contracts signed with China, thereby causing great difficulties for China. However, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have overcome all the difficulties caused by the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The report said that China has pointed out the path of continuing revolution, providing a guarantee for the victory of socialism and the continued development towards communism. The report said that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China have mobilized the broadest masses to fight against capitalism and revisionism. China has solved the problem of how to prevent the restoration of capitalism.

The leaders of the Swedish Marxist-Leninist Communist League called on members of the Marxist-Leninist Communist League to study Mao Zedong Thought.

    强烈谴责美苏狼狈为奸妄图瓜分世界
    新华社斯德哥尔摩三日电　瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟十一月三十日和十二月一日在哥德堡举行集会，强烈谴责美帝、苏修狼狈为奸，相互勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界的罪恶行径。
    在集会上，瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟的领导人做了报告。报告说，美帝国主义对越南发动了侵略战争，还剥削和压迫世界其它各国的工人阶级。美帝国主义是全世界人民的敌人。
    报告说，苏联修正主义领导集团在国内复辟资本主义，剥削和压迫劳动人民、工人和农民，使他们处于水深火热之中。
    报告说，苏联修正主义领导集团在对外政策方面背叛了列宁和斯大林的对外政策。他们背叛了列宁的反对社会主义的敌人、支持世界革命运动的对外政策。苏联修正主义领导集团用提供贷款的方式支持屠杀了成千上万的印度尼西亚共产党人与和平战士的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安军人法西斯独裁统治。他们支持印度反动派侵略中国，并勾结印度资产阶级剥削印度无产阶级。他们还在联合国同美帝国主义进行交易来镇压其它国家的革命运动。
    报告说，苏联修正主义领导集团反对中国的“人民公社”和中国的工业化，撕毁了同中国签订的合同，从而给中国造成了巨大困难。但是，中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下克服了苏联修正主义领导集团的背叛行动所造成的一切困难。
    报告说，中国指出了继续革命的道路，提供了社会主义取得胜利和向共产主义继续发展的保证。报告说，毛主席和中国共产党动员了最广大的群众进行了反对资本主义、修正主义的斗争。中国解决了如何防止资本主义复辟的问题。
    瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟的领导人号召马列主义者共产主义联盟的成员学习毛泽东思想。
