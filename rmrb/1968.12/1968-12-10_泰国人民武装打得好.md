This year, the armed forces of the Thai people, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, have continuously launched attacks against the U.S.-Thanom clique, annihilating a large number of enemy forces. This is a major victory for the Thai people's patriotic armed struggle. The Thai people's armed forces fight well! We extend our warm congratulations.

The situation of the Thai people's patriotic armed struggle is excellent and getting better. After three consecutive years of battle, the Thai people's armed forces have continuously grown stronger. They rely on the broad masses of farmers, display a brave and tenacious fighting spirit, and use flexible and mobile strategies and tactics to shatter the U.S.-Thai reactionary forces' multiple counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. They have consolidated their base areas and expanded their operational regions to 31 provinces and over 100 counties. They have learned from war to wage war, gradually mastering the laws of people's war, and have become a strong people's armed force. This heroic force is the main pillar of the Thai people's liberation cause and an important force in Southeast Asia against U.S. imperialist aggression.

Under the inspiration of the victories of the Thai people's armed struggle, a vigorous revolutionary mass movement has arisen in the areas controlled by the U.S.-Thai reactionary forces. The student demonstrations that erupted in Bangkok in June and July reflected the Thai people's hatred for the fascist rule of the U.S.-Thai reactionary clique and marked a new awakening of the Thai people.

The Thai people's armed struggle and revolutionary mass movement are converging into a revolutionary torrent, fiercely assaulting the foundations of the U.S.-Thai clique's reactionary rule. The U.S.-Thanom ruling clique is now surrounded by the revolutionary people of Thailand.

To maintain their reactionary rule, the U.S.-Thanom clique, on the one hand, has intensified military "encirclement and suppression" against the Thai people's armed forces, and on the other hand, has put forward a fake constitution and held so-called parliamentary elections, attempting to use these means to dampen the people's fighting spirit, induce the people to lay down their arms, and stop fighting, thus solving problems that they have been unable to resolve with airplanes and cannons for years. However, these tricks are also doomed to fail. The revolutionary people of Thailand have increasingly come to understand the great truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" through their own struggle. They understand that only by relying on the people's guns can they overthrow the U.S.-Thai reactionary rule and achieve their liberation. What "constitution" and "elections" are all deceptive tricks that do not harm the reactionary rule of the Thanom clique in the slightest and do not change the miserable situation of oppression and exploitation of the broad masses of the Thai people. No matter how the U.S.-Thanom clique plays its counter-revolutionary tricks, it cannot extinguish the blazing fire of the people's armed struggle.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To mobilize the entire people, we create an ocean in which the enemy is bound to perish, we create the conditions to make up for the lack of weapons, and we create the premise for overcoming all difficulties of war." The reason why the people's armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand has been able to grow from small to large and from weak to strong in a relatively short period of time, achieving a great situation, is fundamentally because the Communist Party of Thailand has adhered to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and adhered to people's war. The Thai people's armed forces are rooted in the broad masses of farmers, developing and growing stronger through propaganda, organization, and arming the masses. Although the Thai people will still encounter various difficulties in their struggle, as long as they adhere to this correct line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely achieve final victory. The downfall of the U.S.-Thanom clique is inevitable.

    泰国人民武装打得好
    本报评论员
    今年以来，泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装向美国—他侬集团不断发动进攻，消灭了敌人大量的有生力量。这是泰国人民爱国武装斗争的重大胜利。泰国人民武装打得好！我们表示热烈的祝贺。
    泰国人民爱国武装斗争的形势一片大好，而且越来越好。经过连续三年的战斗，泰国人民武装力量不断发展壮大。他们依靠广大农民群众，发扬勇敢顽强的战斗精神，运用灵活机动的战略战术，粉碎了美泰反动武装多次的反革命“围剿”，巩固了根据地，把作战地区扩大到三十一个府、一百多个县。他们从战争中学习战争，逐步掌握人民战争的规律，成为一支坚强的人民武装部队。这支英雄部队，是泰国人民解放事业的主要支柱，是东南亚地区反对美帝国主义侵略的一支重要力量。
    在泰国人民武装斗争胜利的鼓舞下，美泰反动派统治地区兴起了轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动。六、七月间在曼谷爆发的学生示威斗争，反映了泰国人民对美泰反动集团法西斯统治的仇恨，标志着泰国人民的新的觉醒。
    泰国人民的武装斗争和革命群众运动，正在汇集成一股革命洪流，猛烈地冲击着美泰集团反动统治的根基。美国—他侬统治集团，正在陷入泰国革命人民的包围之中。
    美国—他侬集团为了维护它们的反动统治，一面加紧对泰国人民武装进行军事“围剿”，一面抛出了伪宪法，大搞所谓议会选举，妄想用这一套办法，麻痹人民的斗志，诱骗人民放下武器，停止战斗，从而解决它们几年来用飞机大炮所无法解决的问题。但是，它们的这一套阴谋把戏，也是注定要破产的。泰国的革命人民从自己的斗争实践中越来越清楚地懂得了“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理，懂得只有依靠人民的枪杆子才能推翻美泰反动统治，取得自己的解放。什么“宪法”，什么选举，统统都是骗人的玩艺儿，丝毫无损于他侬集团的反动统治，丝毫也改变不了泰国广大人民受压迫、受剥削的悲惨处境。不管美国—他侬集团怎样玩弄反革命两手，都扑灭不了越烧越旺的人民武装斗争的烈火。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海，造成了弥补武器等等缺陷的补救条件，造成了克服一切战争困难的前提。”泰国共产党领导下的人民武装斗争，所以能在较短的时间内，由小到大，由弱变强，打出一个大好局面，其根本原因，就是因为泰国共产党坚持了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线，坚持了人民战争。泰国的人民武装，是扎根于广大农民群众之中，通过宣传群众、组织群众和武装群众而发展壮大起来的。泰国人民在斗争的道路上，尽管还会遇到种种困难，但是，只要坚持这条马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确路线，就一定能够取得最后胜利。美国—他侬集团的覆灭将是毫无疑义的。
