The Chuxiong County Forward Commune in Yunnan Province has popularized the rural broadcasting network in the Jin Shang Production Brigade, enabling the poor and lower-middle peasants to timely listen to the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The entire brigade has seen a new upsurge in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought. The spiritual outlook of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants has been greatly improved, and good deeds and good people have emerged in large numbers.

Following Chairman Mao's instructions on self-reliance, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Jin Shang Production Brigade of Chuxiong County's Forward Commune built a rural broadcasting network throughout the brigade in 1965. Over the past three years, they have listened to the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the voice of the proletarian headquarters through the broadcasts, which has powerfully promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought. It has greatly raised the class consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and their spiritual outlook has been greatly improved.

The rural broadcasting network is scattered in the villages and reaches into the homes of the commune members. In the countryside, where transportation is inconvenient and residences are scattered, it can swiftly convey Chairman Mao's instructions to the broad masses of commune members, spread Mao Zedong Thought, exchange experiences of revolutionary masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and promote the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Jin Shang Production Brigade live in the mountains but have their hearts with Chairman Mao. They have long been eager to build a rural broadcasting network. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his local agents feared and hated this idea and did everything they could to sabotage it. The capitalist roaders in Chuxiong County once maliciously attacked, saying, "The countryside is poor, why install a broadcast?" The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly resisted and fought back. They said, "The rural broadcasting network must be built. We must hear Chairman Mao's voice, and we must read Chairman Mao's books. We must let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions." Thus, they worked during the day to lay the lines and at night each family installed their own lines. In three days, they laid thirteen kilometers of lines. The red waves connected more than 150 households of poor and lower-middle peasants with Beijing. Li Shihai, a 51-year-old poor peasant from the Hebian Production Team, said, "Chairman Mao has sent each of our poor and lower-middle peasant families a teacher (referring to the loudspeaker), and the entire brigade has become a school of Mao Zedong Thought."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "If socialism does not occupy the countryside, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." The contrast before and after the installation of the broadcast in the Jin Shang Production Brigade fully proves this point. In the past, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants worked during the day and in the evening, the whole family would sit together chatting about family affairs; some would visit neighbors, talking about the prices in the market; the youth would gather in groups of three or five to play cards; some would even tell old stories and spread the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, which had a bad influence. After the establishment of the rural broadcasting network, every evening after work, the family would gather around to listen to the voice from Beijing. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions were broadcast, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres would be deeply moved, and they would beat drums and gongs to hold celebration meetings.

Before liberation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Jin Shang Production Brigade suffered deeply from the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, could not go to school, and there were few educated people. After the establishment of the rural broadcasting network, this problem was well solved. The Yadanchong Production Team, which is relatively far from the brigade, has six households living in three places, and out of 25 adults, only one had attended three years of primary school. The poor and lower-middle peasant commune members in this team have been able to recite the "Three Articles" through listening to the broadcasts.

The team cadres learned advanced experiences from other places through the broadcasts, which also promoted their own ideological revolutionization and leadership in production. Li Shuzong, the team leader of the Hebian Production Team, said, "The broadcasts introduced advanced experiences from other places, and before the brigade made arrangements, our team had already started practicing them." Li Fazhang, a member of the brigade revolutionary leading group, learned from the model deeds of Chen Yonggui from Dazhai and changed his leadership style. He actively participated in collective production labor, took the initiative to care about the poor and lower-middle peasants' hardships, often visited the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and improved the relationship between the cadres and the masses.

Now, the entire brigade is seeing a new upsurge in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, and good deeds and good people are emerging in large numbers.

    让毛主席的声音最迅速地传到边远的山村
    云南楚雄县前进公社阱上大队普及了农村广播网，使贫下中农能够及时听到伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示。全大队出现了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动的新高潮，广大贫下中农的精神面貌焕然一新，好人好事层出不穷
    云南楚雄县前进公社阱上大队广大贫下中农遵照毛主席关于自力更生的教导，于一九六五年在全大队普及了农村广播网。三年来，他们通过广播及时地听到了伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，听到了无产阶级司令部的声音，有力地推动了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大大提高了广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，精神面貌焕然一新。
    农村广播网，分散在村庄，深入到社员群众家中。在交通不便、居住分散的农村，它能够最迅速地向广大社员群众传达毛主席的指示，传播毛泽东思想，交流各地革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的经验，推动学习毛主席著作的群众运动。
    阱上大队广大贫下中农身在山村，心向毛主席，很早以来就迫切地要求建设农村广播网。但是，大叛徒刘少奇及其在当地的代理人，对此却怕得要死，恨得要命，极力进行破坏。楚雄县的走资派就曾恶毒地攻击说：“农村穷，还安什么广播？”贫下中农进行了坚决的抵制和斗争。他们说：“农村广播网一定要办。毛主席的声音我们一定要听，毛主席的书我们一定要读，一定要让战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。”于是，他们白天架线，晚上各家各户自己安地线，三天之内共架线十三公里。红电波把一百五十多户贫下中农和北京紧紧地联在一起。河边生产队五十一岁的贫农李世海说：“毛主席给我们贫下中农每家派来一个老师（指广播喇叭），全大队办成毛泽东思想大学校有条件了。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”阱上大队安装广播前后的对比，充分证明了这一点。过去，广大贫下中农白天劳动，晚上一家人都坐在一起谈家常；有的串门子，说的是张家长，李家短，议论市场物价；青年则三五成群地打扑克；有的人甚至大讲旧小说，散布封、资、修的毒素，影响很坏。建立农村广播网后，每天劳动之后，一家人围在一起，收听来自北京的声音。每当从广播里传来了毛主席的最新指示时，广大贫下中农和革命干部都激动万分，敲锣打鼓地召开庆祝大会。
    解放前，阱上大队的广大贫下中农深受地主阶级的压迫剥削，读不起书，有文化的人很少。农村广播网建立后很好地解决了这个问题。离大队较远的鸭蛋冲生产队，全队六户人家，分住在三个地方，二十五个成年人中只有一人读过三年小学。这个队的贫下中农社员通过收听广播，大部分人都能背诵“老三篇”。
    队干部从广播里学习了外地的先进经验，对自己思想革命化和领导生产也起了促进作用。河边生产队队长李术宗说：“广播里介绍了外地的先进经验，不等大队布置我们生产队就先学着干起来。”大队革命领导小组成员李发祥听了大寨陈永贵同志的模范事迹后，就改变了自己的领导作风，积极参加集体生产劳动，主动地关心贫下中农的疾苦，经常深入到贫下中农家里，改善了干群关系。
    现在，全大队正在出现一个活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动的新高潮，好人好事层出不穷。　本报通讯员
