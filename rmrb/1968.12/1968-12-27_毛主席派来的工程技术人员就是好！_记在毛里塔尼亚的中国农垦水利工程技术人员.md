In the southern part of Mauritania, along the lower reaches of the Senegal River in the Rosso region, Chinese agricultural reclamation and water conservancy engineering and technical personnel are helping the people of Mauritania develop the Mpuli Plain, preparing to establish an experimental farm there to grow rice. Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, under the care and support of the Mauritania government and people, the Chinese engineering and technical personnel have overcome various difficulties and have already achieved success in small-scale rice trials. Currently, they are busily engaged in various water conservancy construction projects. Their spirit of dedicated service to the people of Mauritania and their work attitude have received enthusiastic praise from the broad masses of the Mauritania people: “The engineering and technical personnel sent by Chairman Mao are the best!”

	Successful Rice Trials

	Long-term colonial rule has hindered the economic development of Mauritania, making it impossible for the country to be self-sufficient in grain. Every year, a considerable amount of foreign exchange is spent on importing rice. To help the people of Mauritania develop rice cultivation, the Chinese government, at the request of the Mauritania government, sent the first batch of agricultural reclamation technical personnel in August 1966. When the Chinese technical personnel conducted on-site surveys in the southern part of Mauritania, along the northern bank of the Senegal River in the Rosso region, they were warmly welcomed by the local people everywhere they went. Residents provided detailed information and even voluntarily brought tea and food to the Chinese technical personnel. A resident of a village said: “All the people in our village are willing to learn from you to clear land and grow rice!”

	On-site surveys confirmed that, based on soil, climate, and water conservancy conditions, the vast alluvial plains near Rosso City along the Senegal River—Mpuli Plain—are completely suitable for rice cultivation. The Chinese agricultural reclamation technical personnel decided to conduct small-scale trials there first. At this time, an “agricultural expert” from an imperialist country, who had been in the Rosso region for many years without achieving anything, spread lies saying: “The Mpuli Plain has unsolvable salinity and alkalinity problems; the flood season is long, and the plain cannot be developed,” and so on. The Chinese technical personnel, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were determined to refute these absurd lies with facts. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao’s instructions: “Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory.” After selecting the trial site, they started clearing the land. To catch the season and save time, they did not even rest on Sundays. When the trial field was surrounded by floods, they waded through the water to plant the rice. Under the scorching sun, their skin peeled off, and their feet swelled from the water, but they continued to fight tenaciously. Seeing this, nearby residents eagerly took tools from the Chinese technical personnel to join in the work. An old worker said with deep emotion: “Chinese aid is truly aid; Chinese people are indeed here to help us. The so-called ‘aid’ from imperialists is only to plunder us more quickly and more thoroughly.”

	Under the hard work of the Chinese technical personnel and the strong support of the local residents, the Mpuli Plain saw green rice seedlings for the first time. The good news spread, and the local residents were overjoyed. To ensure the healthy growth of the seedlings, farmers from four nearby villages voluntarily donated more than twenty thousand pounds of manure without compensation; the field guard Bougue, fearing that livestock grazing nearby would trample the seedlings, set up a tent by the field and moved his entire family to live there, guarding the trial field day and night. During the harvest, farmers from nearby villages came in groups to help with the harvesting and threshing. An old farmer held up a heavy ear of rice, looked at it again and again, and was deeply moved. The driver Mokta selected more than twenty ears of rice and specially took them more than two hundred kilometers to the capital Nouakchott to share the good news with relatives and friends. After the news of the Chinese agricultural reclamation technical personnel’s successful rice trials spread, farmers from thirty kilometers away came to ask for rice seeds, and many Mauritania friends came to congratulate the Chinese technical personnel. The fact that rice cultivation was successful on the Mpuli Plain finally shattered the shameless lies of the imperialist “experts.”

	Racing Against the Flood

	After the successful rice trials, according to the Sino-Mauritanian Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement signed in Beijing in February 1967, the Chinese government undertook various engineering projects to help Mauritania reclaim and build a farm on the Mpuli Plain. The first project to develop the Mpuli Plain was to build a two-meter-high, thirteen-kilometer-long flood-prevention dyke around the plain. This dyke had to be completed before the flood season in mid-September this year; otherwise, it would affect the progress of subsequent projects. However, at that time, there were only four and a half months left until the flood season. Should they face the difficulties head-on and complete the six-month work in four and a half months, or should they avoid risks and simply wait until the flood recedes next year to start work? The Chinese water conservancy engineering and technical personnel, tempered by the great proletarian cultural revolution, decided to fight against the difficulties. Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao’s “Three Articles,” they launched the dyke construction battle with Mauritania workers in late April. The Chinese engineering and technical personnel always remembered the great leader Chairman Mao’s instructions: “Strategically, we must despise difficulties; tactically, we must take difficulties seriously.” At the same time, they paid attention to cultivating Mauritania’s technical talents and saving the people’s manpower and material resources. They changed from the original daytime single shift to day and night double shifts, from the original two-person per shift to one-person per shift for machine operators, and the logistics service personnel became multi-skilled, doing various jobs. They also used accelerated methods to train a batch of Mauritania machine operators. When the project reached its most intense stage, many people worked continuously for nearly thirty hours. Even those who were sick did not rest and continued to work.

	The once grassy plain became a bustling construction site with various machines roaring day and night. Residents of Rosso City, seven or eight kilometers away from the construction site, often came in groups at night to visit. They told the Chinese engineering and technical personnel: “Imperialist ‘experts’ talk but do not act, sitting in air-conditioned offices and still complaining about the heat, and they have to take a car to go out. But you, in such hot weather, work during the day and at night, we have never seen such good foreigners!”

	After more than three months of intense battle, the dyke construction task was completed more than twenty days ahead of schedule. Currently, the Chinese technical personnel have launched the canal excavation project.

	The Joy of the People of Diouk Village

	Outside the flood-prevention dyke near Diouk Village, there is a relatively large village on the Mpuli Plain, with 250 households and more than a thousand residents. The villagers mainly engage in agriculture (mainly growing sorghum) and also engage in weaving mats and fishing. Due to the harm caused by floods, agricultural production has long been unable to develop. Every year during the flood season of the Senegal River, residents are unable to engage in productive labor.

	When the flood-prevention dyke was built near Diouk Village, the Chinese engineering and technical personnel decided to help reinforce the village protection dyke to eliminate the threat of floods. The construction of the flood-prevention dyke can already ensure that the 300 hectares of land reclaimed by the residents of Diouk Village inside the dyke are free from drought and waterlogging, and they can also reclaim more land to grow rice. Now, the Chinese engineering and technical personnel are voluntarily helping them reinforce the village protection dyke. The entire village immediately became excited upon hearing the news, and many people enthusiastically shouted, “Long live Chairman Mao!” The villagers immediately started work and quickly cleared away the garbage and debris near the village protection dyke to facilitate the use of bulldozers and graders by the Chinese engineering and technical personnel. After six days and nights, more than ten thousand cubic meters of earth were added to the more than two thousand meters long village protection dyke, making the dyke high and thick. To facilitate the villagers’ transportation, a road more than one hundred and seventy meters long was also built between the village protection dyke and the flood-prevention dyke. In this way, during the flood season, the villagers can also freely enter and exit the village. During the village protection dyke reinforcement period, many Mauritania friends often performed songs and dances at the construction site to express their greetings. One evening, the three oldest farmers in the village (one aged ninety and two aged eighty-eight) specially came to the construction site to visit. They enthusiastically praised China’s selfless aid. The excitement made the three old men forget to rest and they continued talking until the next morning before returning home. When the reporter visited Diouk Village, they met these three elders again. As soon as they met, they excitedly shouted, “Long live Chairman Mao!” They then told the reporter, “All the people of Diouk Village and all the people of Mauritania are grateful for China’s selfless aid! The Chinese engineering and technical personnel not only help us develop the plain and develop the economy but also cultivate technical talents for us.”

	On the evening of September 30, the eve of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the Chinese engineering and technical personnel held a tea party at their residence to entertain Mauritania friends. At the meeting, the guests used vivid examples they had heard and seen to praise the Chinese engineering and technical personnel. An old resident of Rosso City said, “You Chinese people not only work hard, live frugally, but also treat people equally. We all regard you as brothers.” The guests praised, “The engineering and technical personnel sent by Chairman Mao are the best!” Many people also enthusiastically shouted, “Long live Chairman Mao!”

    “毛主席派来的工程技术人员就是好！”
    ——记在毛里塔尼亚的中国农垦水利工程技术人员
    在毛里塔尼亚南部塞内加尔河下游的罗索地区，中国农垦水利工程技术人员正在帮助毛里塔尼亚人民开发姆普利平原，准备在那里建立实验农场，种植水稻。中国工程技术人员依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在毛里塔尼亚政府和人民的关怀和支持下，克服了种种困难，已经在那里获得小面积试种水稻成功，目前，正在紧张进行各项水利建设工程。他们为毛里塔尼亚人民热心服务的精神和劳动态度，受到毛里塔尼亚广大人民的热烈赞扬：“毛主席派来的工程技术人员就是好！”
      试种水稻成功
    长期的殖民主义统治，使毛里塔尼亚的经济得不到发展，粮食不能自给，每年要花不少外汇来进口大米。为了帮助毛里塔尼亚人民发展水稻种植，中国政府应毛里塔尼亚政府的要求，于一九六六年八月派出了第一批农垦技术人员。中国技术人员到毛里塔尼亚南部塞内加尔河北岸的罗索地区进行实地勘察时，每到一地，都受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。居民们详尽地提供有关情况，还纷纷自动地给中国技术人员送茶送饭。有个村庄的居民说：“我们全村的人都愿意跟你们学开荒种水稻！”
    实地勘察证明：根据土壤、气候、水利等条件，罗索市附近塞内加尔河肥沃的广大冲积地带——姆普利平原完全有条件种植水稻。中国农垦技术人员就决定在那里先进行小面积的试种。这时，在罗索地区混了多年而毫无成就的帝国主义国家的一个“农业专家”散布谎言说：“姆普利平原种水稻，盐碱化问题无法解决；洪水期长，平原无法开发”等等。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国技术人员决心用事实回击这派胡言乱语。他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在选好试种地点后，他们就动手开荒，为了赶季节，抢时间，星期天也不休息。洪水包围了试验田，他们就趟水去种地。烈日晒脱了皮，洪水泡肿了脚，他们仍然顽强地继续战斗。附近的居民看到这种情景，激动地从中国技术人员手中抢过工具参加劳动。一位老工人非常感慨地说：“中国的援助才是真正的援助，中国人确实是来帮助我们的；而帝国主义的所谓‘援助’，只不过是为了更快更多地掠夺我们。”
    在中国技术人员的辛勤劳动和当地居民的大力帮助下，姆普利平原第一次长出了绿油油的稻秧。喜讯一传开，当地居民无不欢欣鼓舞。为了使秧苗茁壮成长，附近四个村的农民自动无偿地献出了两万多斤厩肥；看田工人卜格唯恐在附近放牧的牲畜踩踏了秧苗，在田边扎起帐篷，把全家都搬来住，日夜精心地守卫着试验田。收获时，附近农民成群结队来帮助收割、脱粒。有位老农民双手捧起沉甸甸的稻穗，瞧了又瞧，万分激动。给中国技术人员开车的司机莫克塔选了二十多个稻穗特地带到二百多公里以外的首都努瓦克肖特向亲友们报喜。中国农垦技术人员试种水稻成功的消息传出后，三十公里以外的农民赶来要稻种，许多毛里塔尼亚朋友前来向中国技术人员表示祝贺。姆普利平原种水稻成功的事实，终于粉碎了帝国主义“专家”的无耻谎言。
      与洪水抢时间
    水稻试种成功后，根据一九六七年二月在北京签订的中国—毛里塔尼亚经济技术合作协定，中国政府承担了帮助毛里塔尼亚在姆普利平原围垦建场的各种工程项目。开发姆普利平原，第一项工程就是要在平原周围筑一道两米多高、十三公里长的防洪大堤；而这道大堤又必须在今年九月中旬洪水期来到之前完成，否则将影响以后工程项目的进行。但是当时离洪水期只有四个多月，是迎着困难而上，将六个多月的工作在四个多月内完成，还是不担风险，干脆等到洪水退后明年开工？经过了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国水利工程技术人员，决定向困难开战。在毛主席的“老三篇”的光辉思想指引下，他们于四月下旬同毛里塔尼亚工人一起投入了修堤战斗。中国工程技术人员时刻牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，战略上要藐视困难，战术上要重视困难。同时，注意培养毛里塔尼亚的技术人材，节约毛里塔尼亚人民的人力、物力。他们由原来的白天一班制，改为日夜两班制，机车驾驶员由原来的两人一班改为一人一班，后勤服务人员成为多面手，兼作各项工作。他们还用速成方法，培养了一批毛里塔尼亚机车驾驶员。当工程进行到最紧张的阶段，不少人连续工作近三十个小时。有病的也不肯休息，一直坚持工作。
    往日野草丛生的平原，变成了各种机器日夜轰鸣的热闹工地。距工地七、八公里的罗索市居民常常三五成群，深夜前来参观，他们对中国工程技术人员说：“帝国主义的‘专家’动嘴不动手，蹲在有冷气的办公室里还嫌热，出门就得坐小汽车；而你们，这样大热的天气，白天干，夜里也干，我们从未见过这样好的外国人！”
    经过三个多月的紧张战斗，终于提前二十多天完成了修堤任务。目前，中国技术人员又投入了挖渠工程的紧张劳动。
      迪厄克村民的喜悦
    在防洪大堤堤外附近有个迪厄克村，这是姆普利平原上一个较大的村落，共二百五十户，居民千余人。村民主要以农业为生（主要种高粱），还从事编草席、打鱼等副业。因洪水为害，农业生产长期得不到发展。每年塞内加尔河水泛滥期间，居民无法从事生产劳动。
    当防洪大堤修到接近迪厄克村时，中国工程技术人员决定顺便帮助迪厄克村加固护村堤，以解除洪水的威胁。筑起防洪大堤本来就可使迪厄克村居民在堤内开垦的三百公顷土地旱涝保收，又可使他们开垦更多的土地来种水稻。现在中国工程技术人员又自动来帮助他们加固护村堤，全村听到这个消息立即沸腾起来，许多人激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”村民们立即动手很快地把护村堤附近的垃圾、杂物清除干净，以便使中国工程技术人员顺利地使用铲土机、推土机。经过六个昼夜，两千多米长的护村堤上增添了一万多方土，堤坝筑得又高又厚。为了便利村民的交通，还在护村堤与防洪大堤之间筑起一条长达一百七十多米的道路，这样，在洪水期间，村民也可以自由出入村庄。修护村堤期间，许多毛里塔尼亚朋友经常到工地表演歌舞，对中国工程技术人员表示慰问。一天晚上，村中年纪最大的三位老农民（一位九十岁，两位八十八岁）特地来工地参观，他们热情赞扬中国的无私援助。激动的心情使这三位老人忘记了休息，一直谈到第二天早晨才回家。这次记者到迪厄克村访问时又会见到这三位长者，一见面他们就激动地高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”接着对记者说：“我们全迪厄克村、全体毛里塔尼亚人民都感谢中国的无私援助！中国工程技术人员，不仅帮助我们开发平原发展经济，而且还为我们培养技术人材。”
    今年九月三十日晚，中华人民共和国成立十九周年的前夕，中国工程技术人员在驻地举行一个茶话会，招待毛里塔尼亚朋友们。会上，客人们用自己耳闻目睹的生动事例，赞扬中国工程技术人员。一位罗索市老市民说：“你们中国人不仅劳动好，生活朴素，还平等待人，我们都把你们看做兄弟。”客人们赞扬说：“毛主席派来的工程技术人员就是好！”许多人还热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
