Broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary masses in cities and countryside throughout Hebei Province have closely linked the practice of class struggle and two-line struggle in their localities with the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the Party. They have enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and combined the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the Party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation. This has continuously raised the awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle and rapidly advanced the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts.

After the re-publication of the brilliant document "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" by the great leader Chairman Mao, Hebei Province immediately launched a wave of extensive propaganda and study. Under the organization and leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, millions of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary masses formed propaganda teams. They went deep into factories, mines, streets, and villages, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions and speaking about the history of the two-line struggle within the Party. Various types of study classes on the history of the two-line struggle and the implementation of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, with the content of studying Mao Zedong Thought, spread throughout the cities and countryside of the entire province. In Zhangjiakou alone, more than 90,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes were organized.

In the course of deeply carrying out the study movement of the history of the two-line struggle, various places in Hebei closely linked the historical facts of class struggle and two-line struggle in their localities with the enthusiastic praise of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. During the period of agricultural cooperation, after Chairman Mao discovered the fact that the three poor peasants Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaqi, and Wang Xiaopang in Nanzhuang, Anping County, insisted on the path of cooperation, he timely and wisely pointed out in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" that "the direction represented by these three poor peasants is the direction of the five hundred million peasants in the whole country." When the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi used the excuse of opposing "rushism" to slash cooperatives, the great leader Chairman Mao used the facts of Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, to expose Liu Shaoqi's plot to slash cooperatives and critically struck at right opportunism with a single blow in the annotation to the article "Cadres Take the Lead, the Whole Party Builds Cooperatives." In the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, the great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected Cheng'an and Xushui counties in Hebei Province, giving great encouragement and support to the people of Hebei. At the time when the national economy encountered temporary difficulties from 1960 to 1962 and domestic class struggle became more acute, the great leader Chairman Mao affirmed the socialist education movement carried out by the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside of Hebei Province. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao once again personally inspected Hebei and gave extremely important instructions for the proletarian cultural revolution. Broad masses of revolutionaries recalled these vivid historical facts, further deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xipu Brigade, Jianming Commune, Xuanhua County, re-read Chairman Mao's annotation to the article "Cadres Take the Lead, the Whole Party Builds Cooperatives" written thirteen years ago, reviewed the course of struggle since cooperation, and further raised their awareness of the two-line struggle. They said with great emotion: We poor and lower-middle peasants have deeply felt from the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines over the past more than ten years, especially from the practice of the proletarian cultural revolution over the past two years, that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline, our line of survival. We must carry out class struggle and the struggle of the two lines every day, every month, every year, and never relax.

While enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the broad masses of revolutionaries also, in combination with local realities, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and his attempt to restore capitalism, closely linking the study of the history of the two-line struggle with revolutionary criticism. They learned and applied in the struggle, continuously raising their awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle. As early as the land reform movement in 1947, Liu Shaoqi spread the poison of "moving stones" in Ping Mountain County, which had an impact on various revolutionary base areas. During the socialist transformation of agriculture, he slashed agricultural cooperatives and sabotaged the cooperation and people's commune movements. After Chairman Mao personally launched the socialist education movement, he sent his wife to Funing to concoct the stinking "Peach Garden Experience," madly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In February 1957, he went to Shijiazhuang to hold a so-called "students' symposium," vigorously spreading the "study to become an official" theory and promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. He also went to factories and mines such as Kaiping and Fengfeng to vigorously peddle the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "class struggle extinction theory," "bonus as the commander," and "material incentives," attempting to corrupt the revolutionary will of the working class and achieve his evil purpose of restoring capitalism. Broad masses of revolutionaries deeply exposed and criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's evil deeds in various places in Hebei, using them as negative teaching materials for studying the history of the two-line struggle. Through persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism, everyone's hatred for the great traitor Liu Shaoqi increased, and their love for the great leader Chairman Mao deepened, raising their awareness of the two-line struggle.

Based on the continuous improvement of the awareness of the two-line struggle, revolutionary masses in various places have enthusiastically taken Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as their guide. They have thoroughly examined the gaps in their thoughts and work, formulated comprehensive measures to implement the tasks of the struggle, criticism, and transformation at various stages proposed by Chairman Mao, and rapidly advanced the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts.

    结合当地阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的历史事实开展学习运动
    毛主席的革命路线更加深入人心
    河北广大革命群众找差距，订措施，把各条战线的斗批改迅速推向前进
    据新华社石家庄电  河北省城乡广大工人、贫下中农和革命群众，紧密联系当地阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实践，热烈赞颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，深刻批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，把党内两条路线斗争史的学习同斗、批、改结合起来，使阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，把各条战线的斗、批、改迅速推向前进。
    伟大领袖毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这一光辉文献重新发表以后，河北全省立即掀起大宣传、大学习的热潮。在各级革委会的组织领导下，数以百万计的工人、贫下中农、人民解放军指战员、革命的红卫兵小将和革命群众组成的宣传队，深入城市的厂矿街道和农村的社队院户，宣传毛主席的最新指示，大讲党内两条路线斗争的历史。各种类型的以学习两条路线斗争史和落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，遍及全省城乡各个角落，仅张家口地区就办起了九万多个毛泽东思想学习班。
    河北各地在深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，紧密结合当地阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的历史事实，热烈赞颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在农业合作化时期，毛主席发现安平县南王庄王玉坤、王小其、王小庞三户贫农坚持走合作化道路的事迹以后，就在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中及时地、英明地指出：“这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。”当中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇借口反“冒进”大砍合作社的时候，伟大领袖毛主席在《书记动手，全党办社》一文的按语中，运用河北省遵化县的事实戳穿了刘少奇大砍合作社的阴谋，一针见血地批判了右倾机会主义。在大跃进和人民公社化运动中，伟大领袖毛主席亲临河北省成安、徐水等县视察，给予河北人民以莫大的鼓舞和支持。在一九六○年到一九六二年国民经济遇到暂时困难，国内阶级斗争更加尖锐的时刻，伟大领袖毛主席肯定了河北省贫下中农在农村开展的社会主义教育运动。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大领袖毛主席又亲临河北视察，对无产阶级文化大革命运动作了极为重要的指示。广大革命群众回忆这些活生生的历史事实，进一步加深了对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的理解。遵化县建明公社西铺大队的贫下中农，重温毛主席在十三年前为《书记动手，全党办社》这篇文章写的按语，回顾了合作化以来的战斗历程，进一步提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们满怀激情地说：我们贫下中农，从十几年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，特别是两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，深深体会到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们贫下中农的命根子，是我们的生存线。我们对阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，就是要天天搞，月月搞，年年搞，永远也不放松。
    广大革命群众在热烈赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的同时，还结合当地实际，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线和他妄图复辟资本主义的罪行，把两条路线斗争史的学习同革命大批判紧密结合起来，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，不断提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。早在一九四七年的土地改革运动中，刘少奇就在平山县大搞“搬石头”，曾流毒各革命根据地。农业社会主义改造时期，他大砍农业合作社，破坏合作化和人民公社化运动。毛主席亲自发动了社会主义教育运动之后，他又派他的老婆到抚宁炮制臭不可闻的“桃园经验”，疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。一九五七年二月，他窜到石家庄召开所谓“学生座谈会”，极力散布“读书做官论”，推行反革命修正主义教育路线。他还曾经到开滦、峰峰等地厂矿极力兜售“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，妄图腐蚀工人阶级的革命意志，从而达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。广大革命群众深入地揭发批判大叛徒刘少奇在河北各地干的这些罪恶勾当，把它作为学习两条路线斗争史的反面教材。大家通过持久深入地开展革命的大批判，对大叛徒刘少奇更加无比仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱，两条路线斗争的觉悟越来越高。
    各地广大革命群众在不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟的基础上，纷纷以毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席的一系列最新指示为指南，大找思想上和工作上的差距，制定全面落实毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段任务的措施，把各条战线的斗、批、改迅速推向前进。
