The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, has long used the Soviet Komsomol as an important tool to promote their counter-revolutionary revisionist line and to seize the youth from the proletariat.

The Soviet Komsomol was founded by the great revolutionary leader Lenin in 1918. From the very beginning, Lenin clearly defined the nature of the Soviet Komsomol and established the communist direction of the youth movement. The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stipulated in the notice for the establishment of the Komsomol: "The Komsomol is a school for cultivating new, conscious communists." Lenin further stipulated that the youth league should study communism, and the Komsomol and youth should "link every step of their learning, education, and training with the continuous struggle of the proletariat and laborers against the old exploitative society."

Under the leadership and personal care of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Komsomol educated the broad masses of Soviet youth in communism, cultivating many new people with communist consciousness. During the days of the civil war and the Great Patriotic War, Komsomol members, to defend the fruits of the October Revolution and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, fought unyieldingly against domestic and foreign class enemies, displaying great heroism and bravery, and producing a large number of heroic figures.

After the Soviet revisionist clique seized the party and state power, they loudly proclaimed that the youth should study communism, but in reality, they wanted them to study revisionism. The Soviet revisionist clique castrated the class content of Lenin's teachings on studying communism, attacked Lenin's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and relentlessly instilled the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" into the broad masses of youth. They blathered on about how "there are no classes in Soviet society," how "all exploitative social factors have been completely eliminated in the Soviet Union," and how "there are only friendly classes of laborers, whose interests in economics, society, politics, and ideology are consistent." They completely denied the existence of serious class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the Soviet Union, denied the proletarian revolution, and denied the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Soviet revisionist clique maliciously distorted the study of communism into primarily mastering science and knowledge, claiming that with technology, one can enter communism. The Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev once advocated at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Komsomol that the Soviet Komsomol should become "the embodiment and creator of the highest achievements of modern science and culture, otherwise, true communism cannot be built." The Soviet mouthpiece *Pravda* in its editorial celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Komsomol openly peddled revisionist rubbish, claiming that "in the current situation, studying communism means mastering new scientific knowledge and tirelessly seeking effective ways to develop social production." The Komsomol organ *Komsomolskaya Pravda* even blatantly advocated that the task of youth is to "study culture," and whether it is bourgeois or proletarian culture "is temporarily unimportant," leading the broad masses of Soviet youth down the wrong path of prioritizing technology and not engaging in revolution.

Lenin, in his famous speech "The Tasks of the Youth League," emphasized that education for youth should "become the cause of cultivating communist morality in youth." Lenin further explained that communist morality is "morality that serves to unite laborers against all exploitation and all forms of petty private ownership." However, the Soviet revisionist clique, through the Komsomol, relentlessly instilled into youth a bourgeois worldview centered on the self, using bourgeois consciousness such as fame, family, hedonism, and the omnipotence of money to corrupt the broad masses of Soviet youth.

*Komsomolskaya Pravda* extensively promoted the idea that the purpose of youth life is to "become an expert, a master in one's field, then marry, have children," shamelessly advocating that "money is the fundamental motive, whoever has money is happy," and so on. The Soviet revisionist clique even, in the daily activities of the Komsomol, heavily promoted material incentives, everywhere using rubles and bonuses as the banner, and using the allocation of new houses as bait to try every means to push the broad masses of Soviet youth into the quagmire of bourgeois money worship, attempting to turn youth into the kind of "I earn my money, everything else is none of my business" mediocrity that Lenin criticized in "The Tasks of the Youth League."

The Soviet revisionist clique also used the Komsomol to vigorously promote bourgeois lifestyles and "Western civilization," corrupting the will of youth. As early as 1962, the Komsomol in Moscow, in collaboration with the Moscow Composers' Union branch, held the first Moscow Jazz Music Festival, paving the way for the spread of Western decadent music in the Soviet Union. Many local Komsomol organizations also had jazz clubs and youth cafes affiliated with various levels of Komsomol committees. Every night, these cafes were filled with green lights and smoke, using harsh jazz music and grotesque dancing to ravage the bodies and minds of youth. The Soviet Komsomol also spared no effort in promoting Western fashion and modern hairstyles. In many places, there were openly established "Komsomol beauty salons" that studied bourgeois hairstyles. The Soviet revisionist clique used every means to turn the Komsomol into a club for peddling bourgeois lifestyles, to serve its evil purpose of restoring capitalism.

The Soviet revisionist clique, under the guise of the Komsomol fully playing its "social and political initiative," established a series of so-called "social work organizations," such as the "Komsomol Command Center," "Komsomol Inspection Posts," "People's Patrols," "Comrade Courts," and "Komsomol Searchlight Command Center," using these organizations to cultivate a group of thugs to specifically suppress and persecute those who were dissatisfied with the crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique.

The Soviet revisionist leadership also implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist organizational line within the Komsomol. They elevated bourgeois intellectuals to the heavens, claiming that these young "experts" were the "brain center of the Komsomol" and the "soul of the organization," making the leadership of the Komsomol fall into the hands of the privileged stratum of bourgeois intellectuals.

On the one hand, the Soviet revisionist leadership elevated bourgeois intellectuals to the heavens, and on the other hand, they ruthlessly expelled workers and peasants, causing the proportion of workers and peasants in the Komsomol to continuously decline. In 1967, the Soviet revisionists, under the pretext of "replacing Komsomol membership cards," carried out a large-scale purge within the Komsomol, expelling a large number of Komsomol members of worker and peasant origin. It was revealed that during the replacement of membership cards at the grassroots level in the city of Milnoye, within a few days, more than 200 people were expelled from the Komsomol. A worker named Polina Boroninskaya was expelled from the Komsomol because she did not attend a meeting due to maternity leave. Another worker, Boris Mitichkov, was suddenly expelled from the Komsomol because he criticized the instructor.

The Soviet revisionist clique's heinous crimes of poisoning and corrupting Soviet youth have aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the Soviet people. Many people sighed, "The Komsomol is no longer the Komsomol of our time."

The broad masses of Soviet Komsomol members and youth, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, will never forget the teachings of Lenin and Stalin. They will surely raise the banner of Lenin and Stalin, rise up to fight the revolution, and ultimately overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, restoring the dictatorship of the proletariat on Soviet soil.

    苏修共青团是复辟资本主义的工具
    苏修叛徒集团利用苏修共青团培养修正主义接班人，百般毒害青年
    新华社十一日讯　本社记者报道：苏修叛徒集团为了在苏联复辟资本主义，长期以来利用苏联共产主义青年团来作为它推行反革命修正主义路线和向无产阶级争夺青年一代的一个重要工具。
    苏联共青团是伟大的革命导师列宁在一九一八年创建的。列宁一开始就明确规定了苏联共青团的性质，确立了青年运动的共产主义方向。俄共（布）中央在建团通知书中规定：“共青团是培养新的自觉的共产主义者的学校”。列宁又明确规定青年团应该学习共产主义，共青团和青年应“把自己学习、教育和训练中的每一步骤同无产者和劳动者不断进行的反对旧的剥削者社会的斗争联系起来”。
    在列宁和斯大林的领导和亲切关怀下，苏联共青团对苏联广大青年进行共产主义教育，曾经培养了许多具有共产主义觉悟的新人。在国内战争和伟大卫国战争的严峻日子里，共青团员们为保卫十月革命的成果，为巩固无产阶级专政，同国内外阶级敌人进行了不屈不挠的斗争，表现了大无畏的英雄气概，涌现了大批英雄人物。向青年灌输“阶级斗争熄灭论”黑货
    苏修叛徒集团篡夺了苏联党政大权之后，口口声声要青年学习共产主义，但是实际上要他们学习的是修正主义。苏修叛徒集团阉割了列宁关于学习共产主义的阶级内容，攻击列宁关于无产阶级专政的学说，竭力向广大青年灌输“阶级斗争熄灭论”的黑货。他们胡说什么“苏联社会已经没有阶级了”，在苏联已经
  “彻底消灭了一切剥削人的社会因素”，只“存在友好阶级的劳动者团体，它们在经济、社会、政治和思想等方面的利益是一致”的等等，完全否定苏联存在着资产阶级同无产阶级之间的严重阶级斗争，否定无产阶级革命，否定无产阶级专政。
    苏修叛徒集团别有用心地把学习共产主义歪曲为主要是掌握科学和知识，胡说什么有了技术就可以进入共产主义。苏修头目勃列日涅夫就曾在一次共青团中央全会上鼓吹说，苏联共青团应成为“现代科学和文化最高成就的体现者和创造者，否则就不能建成真正共产主义”。苏修喉舌《真理报》在“庆祝”共青团五十周年的社论中大谈“学习共产主义”，它明目张胆地贩卖修正主义破烂货，胡诌什么“在目前情况下学习共产主义就是掌握新科学知识，孜孜不倦地寻找发展社会生产的有效途径”。苏修共青团机关报《共青团真理报》更是赤裸裸地鼓吹青年的任务就是“学习文化”，“至于是资产阶级的文化或无产阶级的文化——暂时不关重要”，把苏联广大青年引上了技术第一，不搞革命的邪路。用资产阶级意识来腐蚀广大青年
    列宁在《青年团的任务》的著名演说中谈到共产主义教育时强调指出，应该使教育青年的全部事业“成为培养青年的共产主义道德的事业”。列宁进一步阐明共产主义道德就是“为了把劳动者团结起来反对一切剥削和一切小私有制服务的道德”。但是，苏修叛徒集团却通过共青团竭力向青年灌输同共产主义道德毫无共同之处的以私字为核心的资产阶级世界观，用成名成家、享乐至上、金钱万能等资产阶级意识来腐蚀苏联广大青年。
      《共青团真理报》大肆宣扬青年的生活目的就是“成为一个专家，本行的能手，然后娶个老婆，生儿育女”，无耻宣扬“金钱是基本动力，谁有钱谁就幸福”，等等。苏修叛徒集团甚至在共青团的日常活动中大搞物质刺激，处处以卢布、奖金挂帅，还用分配新房子等为诱饵千方百计地把苏联广大青年推进资产阶级拜金主义的泥坑，企图使青年变成列宁在《青年团的任务》中批判过的那种“我赚我的钱，其他一切都与我无关”的庸人。
    苏修叛徒集团还利用共青团极力推销资产阶级生活方式和“西方文明”，腐蚀青年的意志。早在一九六二年，莫斯科的共青团就同莫斯科作曲家协会分会联合举办了第一届莫斯科爵士音乐节，为西方靡靡之音在苏联的传播鸣锣开道。许多地方的共青团还设有附属于各级团委会的爵士俱乐部和青年咖啡馆。每到夜晚，这些咖啡馆内酒绿灯红，烟雾迷漫，用刺耳的爵士音乐、丑态百出的摇摆舞来摧残青年的身心。苏修共青团在推销西方时装和摩登发型方面也不遗余力。在不少地方公开设有“共青团美容室”，研究资产阶级发型。苏修叛徒集团千方百计把共青团变成为贩卖资产阶级生活方式的俱乐部，以便为它复辟资本主义的罪恶目的效劳。
    苏修叛徒集团还以共青团应充分发挥“社会政治积极性”为名，建立了一系列的所谓“社会工作组织”，如“共青团指挥部”、“共青团监督岗”、“人民纠察队”、“同志审判会”和“共青团探照灯指挥部”等，利用这些组织为它培养一批打手，专门打击、迫害对苏修叛徒集团的罪行不满的人。重用资产阶级分子排斥工农青年
    苏修领导集团在共青团内部也推行了一条反革命修正主义组织路线。它们把资产阶级知识分子捧上天，说什么这些青年“专家”是“共青团的大脑中枢”、“团组织的灵魂”，使共青团的领导权掌握在资产阶级知识分子特权阶层手里。
    苏修领导集团一方面把资产阶级知识分子捧上天，另一方面大肆排斥工农劳动群众，使共青团员中的工农比重日益下降。一九六七年，苏修借“更换共青团团证”为名，在共青团内进行了一次大规模清洗，把大量工农出身的共青团员排挤出团。据透露，在米尔诺耶市的基层组织换团证时，几天里就把二百人左右开除出团。一个叫波利娜·鲍罗宁斯卡娅的女工因产假未满，未能出席会议而被开除出团。另一个工人鲍里斯·米奇科夫因为对辅导员提了意见，结果突然被开除出了共青团。
    苏修叛徒集团毒害和腐蚀苏联青年的滔天罪行，激起了苏联广大人民的愤怒。不少人感慨万分地说：“现在的共青团不是我们那个时候的共青团了。”
    具有光荣革命传统的苏联广大共青团员和青年决不会忘记列宁和斯大林的教导，他们一定会举起列宁、斯大林的旗帜，奋起进行革命斗争，最后推翻苏修叛徒集团的统治，在苏维埃大地上重建无产阶级专政。
