The cooperative medical care system in rural areas is excellent and should be widely implemented. Only in this way can we further fully implement Chairman Mao's great directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," enabling the broad masses of laboring people to truly grasp the power of medical and health care, and thoroughly solve the problem of having neither doctors nor medicine in rural areas.

I believe that to strengthen the cooperative medical care system, we must implement the principle of "prevention first." The reason is that our cooperative medical care system has just been implemented, with a weak foundation and limited funds. If many people need medication, coupled with long-term patients or the outbreak of epidemics, the limited medical funds will be insufficient.

As the saying goes, "It's better to prevent than to cure." Treating a disease after it has occurred is very passive, while preventing it before it happens gives us the initiative. Therefore, only by focusing on prevention can we reduce the incidence of diseases, keeping people healthy. This not only strengthens the people's physique and resistance to diseases but also saves the country's medical expenses, in line with Chairman Mao's principle of thrift. The bourgeois health line promoted by the traitor Liu Shaoqi neglected prevention and emphasized treatment, pursued grandeur and foreign influence, wasting the people's money without achieving real results. They paid little or no attention to improving the health of the masses, preventing and treating common and frequently occurring diseases.

After implementing cooperative medical care, the medical power is truly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Since cooperative medical care is everyone's business, it must rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and have everyone manage it. Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois health line that emphasizes treatment over prevention and resolutely implement the principle of "prevention first."

I suggest:

1. Establish a cooperative medical care leadership group in the production brigade consisting of the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary medical personnel, and revolutionary cadre leaders. This will facilitate the understanding of ideological and work situations, and enable medical personnel and the masses to learn from each other and exchange experiences.

2. Set up a health station or health prevention station in the brigade, with a small number of medical personnel from the commune health center remaining to continue their work, while the rest are assigned to the brigade under its direct leadership. This will enable medical personnel to directly participate in the three great revolutionary movements, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and receive re-education from them, thoroughly changing their old ideas. Only then can the theories they have learned be well combined with revolutionary practice.

3. Timely understand the masses' opinions on cooperative medical care, health conditions, and disease situations, achieving early detection, early isolation, and early treatment, eliminating diseases in their infancy.

4. Establish and improve the medical and health system, carry out mass patriotic health campaigns, wage a people's war, and have everyone participate in eliminating the four pests. Medical personnel should actively propagate health knowledge, help the masses regularly carry out clean-up campaigns, conduct periodic inspections and evaluations, and cultivate good hygiene habits in everyone.

### 巩固合作医疗，必须贯彻“预防为主”的方针

    巩固合作医疗，必须贯彻“预防为主”的方针
    农村实行合作医疗制度好得很，这种办法应普遍实行。只有这样，才能进一步全面落实毛主席关于“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大教导，使广大劳动人民真正掌握医疗卫生大权，彻底解决农村中一无医，二无药的问题。
    我认为要巩固合作医疗制度，必须实行“预防为主”的方针。原因是，我们的合作医疗制度刚刚实行，家底薄，基金少，如果吃药的人很多，再加上长期服药的病人，或者遇上流行病，仅有的一点医疗经费是不够用的。
    常言说：“有病治疗，不如无病预防。”生了病再治，就很被动，没病时早预防才有主动权。因此，只有把预防抓好了，才能使人少得病，不得病。这样既增强了人民的体质，产生了对疾病的抵抗力，又为国家节省了医疗经费，也符合毛主席关于节约的原则。过去刘少奇这个大叛徒所推行的一整套资产阶级卫生路线，使得一些医务人员重治疗，轻预防，贪大求洋，浪费人民的钱，而不讲求实效。对于如何提高广大人民的健康水平，怎样预防和治疗一些常见病、多发病、普遍存在的病，他们一向是不管，或者是很少管的。
    实行合作医疗后，医疗大权真正掌握在贫下中农手里，合作医疗是大家的事，就得依靠群众，放手发动群众，大家管理。就必须彻底批判那种只重治疗轻视预防的资产阶级卫生路线，坚决执行“预防为主”的方针。
    我建议：
    一、生产大队建立三结合（贫下中农、革命的医务人员、革命的领导干部）的合作医疗领导小组，这样便于掌握思想情况和工作情况，便于医务人员与人民群众互相学习，交流经验。
    二、大队设卫生所或卫生防治站，公社卫生院的医务人员可留少部分人坚持工作，其他人员都下放到大队，由大队直接领导。这样医务人员直接参加三大革命运动，有利于向贫下中农学习，接受贫下中农再教育，彻底改变旧思想。他们所学的理论才可以与革命实践很好地结合起来。
    三、及时了解群众对合作医疗的意见、卫生情况和发病情况，做到三早
  （早发现、早隔离、早治疗），使病情消灭在萌芽状态。
    四、建立健全的医疗卫生制度，开展群众性的爱国卫生运动，打人民战争，人人都要动手消灭四害。医务人员要积极宣传卫生常识，帮助群众经常开展大扫除，定期检查评比，使人人养成良好的卫生习惯。
