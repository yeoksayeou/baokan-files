Soldiers and officers of the Fourth Platoon of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi Province are following Chairman Mao's directive to "persuade urban cadres and others to send their children who have graduated from junior high, senior high, and college to the countryside, and mobilize them to do so." They are actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call by writing letters to encourage their relatives and friends in urban areas to settle down in rural areas and build socialist new villages.

    人民解放军驻陕西省某部四连指战员，遵照毛主席“要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员”的教导，纷纷写信动员自己在城镇的家属亲友，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农村安家落户，建设社会主义新农村。
