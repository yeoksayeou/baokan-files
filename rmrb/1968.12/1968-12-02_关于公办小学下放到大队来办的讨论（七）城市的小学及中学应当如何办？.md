Since this newspaper initiated the discussion on transferring all public primary schools to production brigades, it has attracted widespread attention and enthusiastic responses from revolutionary masses in both urban and rural areas. By November 30, more than 7,000 letters and articles have been received.

Now, many letters have raised the issue of whether urban primary and secondary schools should be managed by factories or jointly by street committees. It seems that the question of how to manage urban primary and secondary schools has been brought to the agenda. This newspaper is prepared to continue the discussion on this issue. Below are some suggestions from readers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities. We hope that the broad masses of workers, students, workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed in primary and secondary schools, revolutionary cadres, teachers, and neighborhood residents in cities and towns will actively express their opinions and share their experiences.

    关于公办小学下放到大队来办的讨论（七）
    城市的小学及中学应当如何办？
    编者按：自本报开展关于把所有公办小学下放到大队来办的讨论后，引起了城乡广大革命群众的普遍注意和极其热烈的反应。到十一月三十日为止，来稿来信已达七千多件。
    现在，许多来信已经提到城市的小学及中学是否可以归工厂来办或者由街道联合起来办。看来，城市的小学及中学如何办的问题，已经提到日程上来。本报准备就这方面的问题继续展开讨论。这里发表的是北京、上海、天津等城市的读者提出的一部分建议。希望城镇的广大工人、学生、进驻小学及中学的工人和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的队员、革命干部、教员以及街道居民，踊跃发表意见和提供经验。
