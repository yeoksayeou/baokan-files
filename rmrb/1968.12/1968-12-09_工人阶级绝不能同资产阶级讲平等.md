The working class must never speak of equality with the bourgeoisie.

Worker Hǎ Guìfāng of the Beijing Knitting Factory

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thought are inevitably stamped with the mark of class." This means that in a class society, there can only be people of different classes, people with different class characteristics, and there will never be super-class people or super-class personalities.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, openly opposes Mao Zedong Thought, erases the class nature of people, and vigorously advocates the fallacies of "class reconciliation" and "class equality," spreading the deceitful lie that "capitalists and workers are equal in personality."

In the old society full of evil, did the capitalists ever respect the personality of workers and speak of equality with us? Absolutely not! Capitalists neither farm nor work, but because they have money and power, they control the government and make the laws, so they can trample us underfoot and arbitrarily trample on the personality of workers. We workers get up at dawn and sleep at midnight, busy all year round, but we can't eat enough, can't keep warm, endure beatings, and suffer abuse, living a life worse than cattle. Is there even a hint of "personal equality" in this?

I started working as a child laborer in a Japanese textile factory at the age of eleven, being beaten and kicked by the capitalists all day, enduring endless bullying and torture. At thirteen, I worked as a lubricator, and the capitalists contemptuously called me "oil rat." One day, I accidentally stained the big shaft line a little, and the capitalist not only cursed me with gritted teeth, calling me "little oil rat," but also used the most despicable and filthy language to curse my ancestors for three generations. Unable to bear it any longer, I argued back with the capitalist. The capitalist, enraged, dragged me out from under the machine, beating and kicking me. I still have scars of hatred on my body to this day. Afterwards, the capitalist said I had cursed him a sentence, violating the factory rules, and forced me to pick up rusty nails for three days after work. These living facts show that the relationship between capitalists and workers is one of exploitation and being exploited, oppression and being oppressed, and there is absolutely no such thing as "personal equality." Liu Shaoqi's frantic spread of the reactionary fallacy that capitalists and workers are "equal in personality" is purely to beautify capitalists, numb the revolutionary will of the working class, and make workers not overthrow the bourgeoisie, allowing the bourgeoisie to ride on our heads forever.

Every time I think of the old society, I am filled with boundless hatred. I hate the capitalists, and I hate the capitalists' agent Liu Shaoqi even more. Every time I think of the new society, I am extremely excited and happily sing, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao." On the eve of national liberation, Chairman Mao had already clearly pointed out that the "contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie" is the fundamental contradiction within the country, and we "must rely wholeheartedly on the working class." However, the traitor, spy, and labor traitor Liu Shaoqi openly whitewashes the capitalists, loudly proclaiming that the working class is "unreliable," and insidiously persuading workers to speak of "equality" with capitalists, beautifying capitalists as "red capitalists," advocating that capitalists "exploit with merit," and relying on them, and placing the capitalists' position above that of workers, as if we cannot survive without capitalists. This is sheer nonsense!

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the working class has become the master of the state and the leading class of the whole society. Can the working class speak of "personal equality" with the bourgeoisie? Absolutely not! The struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie can only be a life-and-death class struggle. The relationship between the working class and the bourgeoisie can only be one of oppression and being oppressed, dictatorship and being dictated, and it can never be a relationship of "personal equality." As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, the relationship between the working class and the bourgeoisie is "absolutely not a relationship of equality, but a relationship of one class oppressing another class, that is, the dictatorship or dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, and it cannot be any other relationship, such as the so-called relationship of equality, the relationship of peaceful coexistence between the exploited class and the exploiting class, the relationship of benevolence and morality, etc."

Why does Liu Shaoqi shout so loudly about the counter-revolutionary fallacy of "personal equality" between workers and capitalists? His evil purpose is to make us forget the past, forget the pain we suffered in the past, forget the scars on our bodies, that is, forget class and class struggle, become relatives with capitalists, speak of friendship, treat each other equally, and let the bourgeoisie attack socialism, attack proletarian dictatorship, and create conditions for the restoration of capitalism; it is to cancel the leading position of the working class, cancel the dictatorship of the working class over the bourgeoisie, and thus let the capitalists ride on the necks of workers again, to seize our power. If Liu Shaoqi's plot succeeds, our country will be like the Soviet Union controlled by the Soviet revisionist clique, the country will become revisionist, the government will change color, and we workers will suffer twice the hardship and twice the bitterness.

We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," hold the printing press firmly, grasp the gun tightly, and constantly consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, always be on guard against the restoration of capitalism. We firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call to "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work," and strive to achieve the combat tasks proposed by Chairman Mao in each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must not only do well in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own units but also step onto the political stage of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents on all fronts, and carry out the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines to the end, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 工人阶级绝不能同资产阶级讲平等

    工人阶级绝不能同资产阶级讲平等
    北京针织总厂工人　郝桂芳
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”这就是说，在阶级社会中，只能有属于不同阶级的人，具有不同阶级特性的人格，决不会有超阶级的人，超阶级的人格。
    刘少奇这个无耻的大叛徒，却公然跳出来反对毛泽东思想，抹煞人的阶级性，极力鼓吹“阶级调和”、“阶级平等”的谬论，大肆散布“资本家和工人在人格上是平等的”骗人鬼话。
    在万恶的旧社会，资本家尊重过工人的人格，同我们讲过平等吗？绝对没有！资本家一不种田，二不做工，但因他们有钱有势，政权是他们掌的，法律是他们定的，就可以把我们踩在脚下，任意践踏我们工人的人格。我们工人起五更，睡半夜，一年忙到头，却吃不饱，穿不暖，挨尽打，受尽骂，过着牛马不如的生活。这难道有一丝一毫的“人格平等”吗？
    我从十一岁开始在日本的纺织厂当童工，整天被资本家打过来，踢过去，受尽欺凌和折磨。十三岁时，我当加油工，资本家轻蔑地叫我“油耗子”。有一天，我不慎把大轴线碰脏了一点，资本家不仅咬牙切齿地骂我“小油耗子”，而且用最卑鄙最龌龊的语言骂我祖宗三代。我忍无可忍，就和资本家顶起嘴来。资本家恼羞成怒，硬把我从机器底下拖出来，拳打脚踢，我身上直到现在还保存着仇恨的伤疤。事后，资本家说我还骂他一句，犯了厂规，硬罚我在放工后的时间里，拣三天烂钉子。这些活生生的事实说明，资本家和工人之间的关系，是剥削和被剥削的关系，是压迫和被压迫的关系，根本就没有什么“人格平等”。刘少奇拚命散布资本家和工人“人格平等”的反动谬论，完全是为了美化资本家，麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要工人不革资产阶级的命，让资产阶级长期骑在我们头上。
    每想起旧社会，我就产生无比的恨，我恨资本家，更恨资本家的代理人刘少奇。每想起新社会，我就万分激动，幸福地唱起“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。在全国解放的前夕，毛主席已经明确指出“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”是国内的基本矛盾，“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。但是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇却公然给资本家涂脂抹粉，大肆叫嚣工人阶级“不可靠”，别有用心地劝说工人要和资本家讲“平等”，美化资本家是什么“红色资本家”，鼓吹什么资本家“剥削有功”，要依靠他们，并要把资本家的地位摆在工人上面，好象我们离开资本家就不得了，就活不成了。这简直是胡说八道！
    在无产阶级专政的条件下，工人阶级已经成为国家的主人，成为全社会的领导阶级。工人阶级难道能同资产阶级讲什么“人格平等”吗？绝对不能！工人阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争，只能是你死我活的阶级斗争。工人阶级和资产阶级之间的关系，只能是压迫和被压迫的关系，专政和被专政的关系，而绝不能是什么“人格平等”的关系。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经一针见血地指出的那样，工人阶级和资产阶级之间的关系，“绝对不是什么平等的关系，而是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的关系，即无产阶级对资产阶级实行独裁或专政的关系，而不能是什么别的关系，例如所谓平等关系、被剥削阶级同剥削阶级的和平共处关系、仁义道德关系等等。”
    刘少奇为什么声嘶力竭地宣扬工人和资本家“人格平等”的反革命谬论呢？他的罪恶目的，是为了让我们忘记过去，忘记过去所受的痛苦，忘记自己身上的伤疤，也就是忘记阶级和阶级斗争，和资本家攀亲戚，讲友谊，平等相处，放手让资产阶级攻击社会主义，攻击无产阶级专政，为复辟资本主义创造条件；就是为了取消工人阶级的领导地位，取消工人阶级对于资产阶级的专政，从而让资本家重新骑在工人的脖子上，再来专我们的政。如果刘少奇的阴谋得逞，我们的国家就会象苏修叛徒集团控制的苏联那样，国家变修，政权变色，我们工人就会受二茬罪，二遍苦。
    我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，掌稳印把子，握紧枪杆子，不断地巩固和加强无产阶级专政，随时注意防止资本主义复辟。我们坚决响应毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的伟大号召，务必实现毛主席提出的在斗、批、改各个阶段的战斗任务。我们不仅要搞好本单位的斗、批、改，而且登上上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台，把刘少奇及其在各条战线上的代理人批倒、批透、批臭，把两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
