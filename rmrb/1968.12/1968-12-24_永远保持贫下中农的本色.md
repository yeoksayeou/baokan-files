I am the son of poor and lower-middle peasants. Our family has never had anyone who went to school. In the spring of 1955, my father sent me to West Community Primary School, which is thirty miles away from home. Before leaving, my father patted my head and affectionately said, "Our family has never had anyone who could read. You being able to go to school is a blessing from Chairman Mao. You must not forget your roots!"

I attended a public primary school. At that time, the school leadership was in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals who faithfully carried out Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. They instilled in students the reactionary idea of "studying to become an official," making us increasingly detached from the three great revolutionary movements, and our bourgeois individualist thoughts became more and more serious, and we became more and more distant from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Because I was poisoned by the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" ideology, my bourgeois individualist thoughts developed continuously, making me "forget labor after finishing primary school; forget the countryside after finishing middle school; forget the peasants after finishing high school." Under the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of "intellectual education first" and "grades are everything," I worked day and night to prepare for the high school entrance exam. Because of overwork, I developed a serious eye disease in my first year of high school and eventually had to drop out and return home.

In 1964, I returned to the countryside to work. Initially, I didn't know how to plow fields or plant crops, and I even ruined the crops while weeding. Theoretically, as a middle school student, I should have been able to be an accountant for a production team. However, when keeping accounts, I didn't understand debits and credits, and sometimes even wrote the vouchers incorrectly. My parents sadly said I was "good for neither literature nor martial arts." In the past, I had often wondered: why were the things I learned in school useless? It was only through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that I found the answer: it was because the traitor Liu Shaoqi, in order to restore capitalism in China, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, attempting to cultivate the new generation of China into their bourgeois successors, thus leading us astray.

In these past few years, I have lived and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Whenever my thoughts show bad tendencies or I have shortcomings in my work, the poor and lower-middle peasants timely and patiently educate me; whenever I make a little progress, the poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically encourage me. In these years of practical struggle, I have learned many precious things from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The most fundamental thing is: the poor and lower-middle peasants have a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. I will forever study and apply Chairman Mao's works, humbly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly reform my worldview, and forever maintain the character of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    永远保持贫下中农的本色
    我是贫下中农的儿子，我们家祖祖辈辈没有一个人上过学。一九五五年春，我父亲送我到离家三十里的西社完小念书。父亲临走时，摸着我的头，亲切地说：“咱家祖祖辈辈没个识字的，你能念上书，是毛主席他老人家给咱的福，可不能忘本啊！”我念的是一所公办小学，那时，学校领导大权掌握在资产阶级知识分子手里，他们忠实地执行了刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，向学生灌输反动的“读书做官论”思想，使我们越学越脱离三大革命运动，越学资产阶级个人主义思想越严重，越学离开贫下中农越远。
    由于我中了大叛徒刘少奇“读书做官论”的毒，资产阶级个人主义思想不断发展，使自己“念了高小，忘了劳动；念了中学，脱离农村；念了高中，忘了农民”。在刘少奇“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”等反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害下，我为了升高中，起早贪黑，准备考试。因为劳累过度，念高中的头一年就得了严重的眼病，最后不得不退学回家。
    一九六四年，我回乡参加了劳动。起初，不会耕田，更不会种地，锄地连苗都锄坏了。按说，我是个中学生，当个生产队会计应该是完全可以的。可是，记账时不懂收方付方，就连单据有时也写错。父母亲痛心地说我“文不成，武不就”。过去我曾反复想过：为什么在学校学的那些东西都用不上？经过这次无产阶级文化大革命，我才找到了答案：原来就是刘少奇这个大叛徒为了在中国复辟资本主义，极力推行反革命修正主义教育路线，妄图把新中国的青年培养成他们的资产阶级接班人，从而把我们引上了邪道。
    这几年来，我和贫下中农一直生活在一起，劳动在一起。每当我思想上露出坏苗头，工作中有缺点时，贫下中农就及时地、耐心地教育我；当我有了一点进步时，贫下中农就热情地鼓励我。在这几年的实践斗争中，我向贫下中农学习了很多可贵的东西，最根本的一条就是：贫下中农有一颗无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红心。我要永远活学活用毛主席著作，虚心地接受贫下中农的再教育，彻底改造世界观，永远保持贫下中农的本色。
