Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "Those who stand on the side of the revolutionary people are revolutionaries; those who stand on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism are counter-revolutionaries." The great traitor Liu Shaoqi has been vigorously promoting the theory of "exploitation has its merits," standing firmly on the reactionary bourgeois position, speaking for the landlords, capitalists, and these blood-sucking wolves. This thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary elevates the landlords and rich peasants to "heaven," while trampling the laboring people into the "hell." He is a dog of the rich families, relying on the landlords, and biting the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Before liberation, my family suffered three generations of exploitation. I started working for the landlords as a child, carrying heavy loads, doing odd jobs, and herding sheep. My two sons, around ten years old, also worked as child laborers, accompanying the sheep. Due to the ruthless exploitation by the landlords, although we peasants toiled day and night, facing the yellow earth and the sky, enduring wind and rain, and struggling in mud and water, we still ended up eating chaff and wild vegetables. In years of disaster, we couldn't even find tree leaves or wild vegetables to eat. One year, a drought struck, and my children were so hungry they couldn't bear it. They went to the big courtyard and grabbed some husked grain (which was just a bit of our labor's fruit), but the landlords saw them, beat and cursed them, and kicked them out. These blood-sucking vampires have hearts more poisonous than snakes!

My three of us worked from dawn to dusk for the landlords, but we still couldn't feed our family. Seeing that our family was about to starve to death, we had to swallow our tears and send our two daughters, aged thirteen and nine, to be child brides. My eldest daughter soon broke her leg after going to her husband's house and died at fifteen. My wife had nothing to eat during her confinement, and the son she just gave birth to starved to death. She also got sick and died. Thinking of the evil old society and the exploitative system that devours people, we poor and lower-middle peasants have endless class hatred and blood-debt revenge!

Back then, landlords exploited, and the government demanded corvée labor. Where was there any chance for the poor? The Kuomintang reactionaries would send people into the mountains every few days, either to demand grain or to demand food, squeezing out every last drop of marrow from the poor and lower-middle peasants. In 1945, the Kuomintang bandits came to demand grain. I couldn't pay, so they beat me and ransacked my home, turning over every pot and pan, even stealing the seeds. Once, the "village dogs" came to catch people. My third brother Guo Yi escaped at night but had no choice but to jump off a cliff and break his leg. The "village dogs" still didn't let him go and dragged him back to the village, beating him half to death. His family had many children, and life was unbearable, so he had to take up a begging basket and a stick to beg from door to door. In the year of disaster, he was forced to sell his children. Which poor family doesn't have a history of blood and tears, who doesn't have a book of bitter accounts!

In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants worked hard all year round, but why were we still so miserable? Ultimately, it was because of the evil exploitative system. The landlords, relying on the power in their hands, ruthlessly exploited the poor, committing all kinds of evil. Fortunately, Chairman Mao led us, the broad masses of the people, to make a revolution, enduring countless hardships, and finally saved us from the sea of suffering. The laboring people have stood up, walking on the bright path of socialism. Chairman Mao is our great savior. Without Chairman Mao, this old man would have long since disappeared, not even leaving a bone. What "exploitation has its merits"?! We poor and lower-middle peasants utterly detest the great traitor Liu Shaoqi who advocates this fallacy! We must loudly refute him: "Exploitation is unreasonable, exploitation is a crime, a heinous crime, deserving death a thousand times over!" What "exploitation saves people"? Liu Shaoqi saves the landlords and rich peasants, harming the poor and lower-middle peasants. He wants to overthrow socialism, restore the exploitative system, and walk the capitalist road of enriching one household while impoverishing a thousand, pushing us back into the sea of suffering, making us suffer twice and endure twice the hardship. How vicious!

Chairman Mao says: "Only socialism can save China." We poor and lower-middle peasants of Shuangdiao follow Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," learn from Dazhai, and walk the Dazhai path. Relying on the great power of the people's commune, in 1965, we fought against heaven and earth, opened mountains and cut through ridges, and in just fifty-five days, we completed the ten-li "Pan Mountain Canal," bringing water to the mountain. The total grain production has increased year by year, reaching 420,000 jin last year. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our socialist road is getting wider and wider, our class consciousness and line struggle consciousness are getting higher and higher, production is getting better and better, the collective is getting richer and richer, and life is getting sweeter and sweeter.

We poor and lower-middle peasants have long been determined to walk the socialist path. With Chairman Mao standing up for us, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi wants to change the situation, but he won't succeed! He wants to prop up the landlords and rich peasants, but he can't! Whoever dares to oppose socialism, we will resolutely overthrow him!

    剥削有罪，罪该万死！
    河北省怀安县水壕洼大队老贫农　郭应
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”大叛徒刘少奇大肆宣扬“剥削有功”论，完全是站在资产阶级反动立场上，替地主、资本家这些吸血鬼、吃人狼说话。这个地地道道的老反革命，把地主、富农捧上“天堂”，把劳动人民踩进地狱，他是富户豪门的一只狗，靠的是地主老财，咬的是贫下中农。
    解放前，我家祖宗三代受尽了剥削。我从小就给地主扛长工，打短工，当羊倌。我的两个小子十来岁就当小长工，搭羊伴子。由于地主老财的残酷剥削，我们庄户人尽管成年累月面朝黄土背朝天，风里雨里地滚打，泥里水里地折腾，可是一年到头还是吃糠咽菜，遇上灾荒年景连树叶、野菜也吃不着。有一年遭了荒旱，孩子们饿得受不了，到黑大门院抓了一些秕谷子（那不过是我们自己的一点点劳动成果），地主老财一看见，连打带骂地把孩子们踢出来。这些吸血鬼的心肠比毒蛇还毒！
    我们爷儿三个起早摸黑为地主卖命，还糊不了一家人的口。眼看一家人就要活活饿死，只好忍着泪把十三岁和九岁的两个闺女送给人家当了童养媳。大闺女到婆家不久就跌断了腿，十五岁上就死了。我老伴坐月子连碗米汤都喝不上，刚生出来的儿子就饿死了，她也得了疯病死去。提起万恶的旧社会，吃人的剥削制度，俺们贫下中农有说不尽的阶级恨，报不完的血泪仇啊！
    那年头，地主剥削，官府要差，那有穷人的活头！国民党反动派三天两头派人进山，不是要粮，就是派饭，简直把贫下中农身上的骨髓油都压榨干了。一九四五年国民党匪帮来催粮，我交不起，他们就打人抄家，把盆盆罐罐翻了个底朝天，连种籽都抢走了。一次“乡狗子”来抓人，我三弟郭义半夜逃走，被追得没办法，从崖头跳下去跌断了腿，“乡狗子”还不放过他，又把他抓回村打了个半死。他家孩子多，日子没法过，只好提起要饭篮，拿起打狗棍，沿村挨户去讨饭吃。遭灾那年，他又被逼得卖儿卖女。我们穷人家那家没有一部血泪史，谁个没有一本苦情账啊！
    旧社会俺们贫下中农一年到头辛勤劳动，为啥还这么苦？归根到底，就是因为存在着万恶的剥削制度。地主老财依仗手中掌握的政权，极力压榨剥削穷人，无恶不作。多亏毛主席他老人家领导我们广大人民群众闹革命，历尽千辛万苦，才把我们从苦海里救出来。劳动人民翻了身，走上了社会主义光明大道。毛主席是我们贫下中农的大救星。没有毛主席，我老汉早就连骨头也找不到了。什么“剥削有功”？！我们贫下中农简直恨透了鼓吹这种谬论的大叛徒刘少奇！我们要大声回击他说：“剥削无理，剥削有罪，罪恶滔天，罪该万死！”什么“剥削是救人”！？刘少奇救的是地主、富农，害的是贫下中农。他想推翻社会主义，恢复剥削制度，走富一户穷千家的资本主义道路，把我们重新推进苦海，重吃二遍苦，重受二茬罪，好毒啊！
    毛主席说：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。我们水壕洼的贫下中农，遵照毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，学大寨，走大寨之路。依靠人民公社的巨大威力，一九六五年战天斗地，开山劈岭，仅用五十五天就开成十里
  “盘山大渠”，把水引上了山，粮食总产量逐年增高，去年达到了四十二万斤。在毛主席的革命路线指引下，我们社会主义道路越走越宽，阶级觉悟和路线斗争的觉悟越来越高，生产越搞越好，集体越来越富，生活越过越甜。
    我们贫下中农走社会主义道路早就铁心了，有毛主席给我们做主，大叛徒刘少奇想变天，没有门！他想把地主、富农扶起来，办不到！谁胆敢反对社会主义，我们就坚决把他打倒！
