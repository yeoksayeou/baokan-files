Traditional Chinese medicine is highly effective in preventing and treating diseases and is widely available in rural areas. We should make full use of it. In rural areas, the cooperative medical system is being implemented. Communes and production brigades can plan and arrange collectively, dispatching experienced poor and lower-middle peasants and medical personnel to cultivate, collect, and process medicinal herbs together.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What should be the basis of our policy? It should be based on our own strength, which means self-reliance." Therefore, rural areas can, according to local conditions, utilize hillsides, embankments, and field edges to solve part of the problem of medicinal herb supply on their own. Excess varieties of medicinal herbs grown by various places can be exchanged for other items of equal value to enrich the variety of medicines; they can also be stored for use in case of sudden shortages.

Rural areas growing their own medicinal herbs can also reduce the complex procedures of procurement, transportation, statistics, and distribution, saving manpower and effort. This will undoubtedly greatly reduce medical costs. The cooperative medical fees borne by each poor and lower-middle peasant participating in rural cooperative medical care can also be gradually reduced as the supply of medicinal herbs increases.

    自己动手培植药材
    中药对于防治疾病有很大好处，广大农村到处都有，我们应该充分利用它。农村实行合作医疗制度，公社、大队可以统一计划，统一安排，委派有实践经验的老贫下中农和医务人员一起种植、采集、加工。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”所以，农村可以根据当地的具体情况，利用山坡、土坎、地头，自己动手，解决一部分药材的来源问题。各地农村自己培植出来的多余品种，还可以互相等价交换，充实药品的种类；也可以储存起来，以备发生突然事故造成缺药现象时应用。
    农村自己动手培植药材，还可以减少收购、运输、统计、分配等大量的复杂的手续，省人省力。这样作，也必然会大大降低医药成本。参加农村合作医疗的贫下中农，每人所负担的合作医疗费，也可以随着药材的增多而逐步减少。
