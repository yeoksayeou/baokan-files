	In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on having poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools in rural areas, Newborn Commune has basically achieved the goal of having production brigades run primary schools. The number of primary schools in the entire commune has rapidly increased from seven to twelve. Over three hundred poor and lower-middle peasant children who were previously unable to attend school or had dropped out have now enrolled in school.

	The People's Daily reports: Since the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "in rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Newborn Commune in Jiayu County, Hubei Province, have taken action. They have entered the schools, broken through the old educational system's rigid rules, and basically achieved the goal of having production brigades run primary schools. The number of primary schools has increased from the original seven to twelve. Over three hundred and twenty poor and lower-middle peasant children who were previously persecuted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and were unable to attend school or had dropped out have now enrolled in school.

	This commune has fourteen production brigades. Before the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, some students had to travel over twenty miles to school, which was very inconvenient. Now, the farthest distance students have to travel to school is no more than three miles, and they still have time to participate in production in the mornings and evenings. The Gangkou Brigade previously had no school. After establishing a new primary school, it enrolled over thirty poor and lower-middle peasant children in just a few days. The poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully said, "This time, the school has been brought to our doorstep. Chairman Mao has truly thought of us!"

	With more schools and more students, there is a shortage of school buildings. How to solve this problem? The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students of this commune have carried on the glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, taking the initiative to build the schools themselves. The Xiliang Brigade established a new primary school, and the brigade cadres mobilized over thirty poor and lower-middle peasants to build simple and practical school buildings. The cadres of the San Mountain Brigade proactively gave up their office and personally converted it into a classroom.

	These people-run primary schools all use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks and have established the "Daily Reading" system. They closely combine the actual situation of the three great revolutionary movements, including class education, farm characters, practical writing, arithmetic, accounting knowledge, water pump principles, tea-making techniques, and military physical training, as formal courses. Old poor peasants, brigade accountants, barefoot doctors, militia cadres, water pump operators, and tea factory workers have taken to the podium to teach. Teachers and students, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers," teach and learn from each other, changing the situation of "teachers lecturing and students listening." In teaching, they especially emphasize the principle of combining theory with practice. This way, students learn actively, remember well, and can apply what they learn.

	After the production brigades ran the primary schools, under the management and education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students took "unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" as their code of conduct and basis for action; they took studying, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their primary task. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions or important editorials are published, they take immediate action, using big-character posters and loudspeakers to spread them to lakeside farmhouses and remote villages, making them known to every household and every individual. After class education, students' class consciousness has significantly improved. A thirteen-year-old poor peasant student, Song Shuisheng, from the Yingshan Brigade, discovered a rich peasant writing reactionary slogans and engaged in a head-on struggle with him. Students study for half a day and participate in brigade production labor in the mornings and evenings, and their sense of labor has generally increased, with many good deeds emerging. The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "Production brigades running primary schools are truly excellent."

    遵照毛主席关于在农村由贫下中农管理学校的指示
    新生公社基本上实现大队办小学
    全公社小学由七所迅速发展到十二所，过去失学或不能上学的三百多名贫下中农子弟进了学校
    本报讯　自从伟大领袖毛主席发出关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示以后，湖北省嘉鱼县新生公社贫下中农闻风而动，他们开进学校，冲破了旧教育制度的条条框框，全公社基本上实现了大队办小学，并由原有的七所小学迅速发展到十二所。过去被反革命修正主义教育路线迫害而失学或不能上学的三百二十多名贫下中农子弟进了学校。
    这个公社共有十四个大队，贫下中农管理学校以前，有的学生上学来回要跑二十多里路，极为不便。现在学生上学最远的不超过三里路，早晚还有时间参加生产。港口大队过去没有学校，这次新办小学后，几天内就招收了三十多名贫下中农子女入学。贫下中农高兴地说：“这回学校办到我们家门口来了，毛主席为我们想得真周到！”
    学校多了，学生多了，校舍不够，怎么办？这个公社的贫下中农和革命师生发扬“抗大”的光荣传统，自己动手干。西凉大队新办了一所小学校，大队干部发动了三十多位贫下中农，修盖了简朴实用的校舍。三山大队的干部主动把办公室让出来，并亲自动手把它改成教室。
    这些民办小学都以毛主席著作为基本教材，建立了“天天读”的制度。还紧密地结合三大革命运动的实际，把阶级教育、庄户字、应用文、珠算、会计知识、抽水机原理、制茶技术、军体等课目列入正式课程，由老贫农、大队会计、“赤脚医生”、民兵干部、抽水机手、茶厂工人登上讲台讲课。师生之间，也根据毛主席关于“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的教导，互教互学，改变了“先生讲、学生听”的状况。在教学中，特别强调贯彻理论联系实际的原则。这样学得活，记得住，用得上。
    大队办小学后，在贫下中农的管理教育下，革命师生把无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，作为自己言行的准则和行动的依据；把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想作为自己的首要任务。每当毛主席的最新指示、重要社论发表后，他们闻风而动，连夜用大字报、广播筒传到湖边农舍、偏僻山村，做到家喻户晓，老幼皆知。经过阶级教育后，学生的阶级觉悟有了很大提高。英山大队十三岁的贫农学生宋水生，发现一个富农分子写反动标语，便和他展开了针锋相对的斗争。学生每天读半天书，早晚都参加队里的生产劳动，劳动观点普遍增强，好人好事大量涌现。贫下中农说：“大队办小学真是好得很。”
