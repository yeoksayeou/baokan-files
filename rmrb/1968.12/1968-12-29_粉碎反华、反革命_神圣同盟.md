The entire world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner.

The revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries are flourishing. The proletariat and revolutionary peoples of the whole world are bravely launching an offensive against the old world.

Led by the United States, imperialism, led by the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries are making desperate struggles, attempting to block the surging forward of the revolutionary torrent. They have joined forces to intensify counter-revolutionary activities.

This gang of Soviet revisionist traitors, driven by their counter-revolutionary instincts, are wholeheartedly collaborating with American imperialism to suppress the revolutionary peoples of various countries. Wherever the U.S. imperialists go to "burn incense," the Soviet revisionists rush to "kowtow"; wherever the U.S. imperialists go to "set fires," the Soviet revisionists rush to "add fuel"; wherever the U.S. imperialists' claws of aggression reach, the people there take up arms to resist, and the Soviet revisionists there peddle counter-revolutionary revisionist narcotics such as "peaceful resolution" and "political resolution," attempting to numb the revolutionary will of the peoples of the world and extinguish the blazing flames of armed struggle of the peoples of various countries.

The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are strengthening their "cooperation," frantically gathering garbage, and organizing an anti-China encirclement. They are directing their spearheads directly at the great socialist China.

To gather garbage and form an anti-China encirclement, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Japanese reactionaries are intensifying their counter-revolutionary collusion and accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism. Under the protection of the U.S. imperialists, the Japanese reactionaries are speeding up the implementation of their third military expansion plan, rapidly militarizing the Japanese economy, and significantly expanding military industrial production. From April to September this year, the number of military supplies Japan sold to foreign countries has reached the highest record since the last year of the U.S. aggression against Korea—1953. The Soviet revisionists actively cooperate with the U.S. imperialists in fostering Japanese militarism and are closely collaborating with Japanese militarism in all aspects. The Soviet revisionist leaders openly praise Japanese militarism as a "peace force" and an "Asian stabilizing force," which is utterly shameless!

To gather garbage and form an anti-China encirclement, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries are also intensifying their new anti-China conspiracies. In July this year, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Cyrus Vance brought a group of so-called "China experts" to New Delhi and held secret talks with the Indian reactionary leader Indira Gandhi to plot new anti-China conspiracies. During this meeting, Indira Gandhi proposed to Vance a plan to organize an "anti-China alliance" under the guise of strengthening "economic ties" among countries surrounding China. This plan immediately received the approval of the U.S. imperialist leader. Throughout this year, Khrushchev and various Soviet revisionist leaders frequently visited New Delhi to plot counter-revolutionary anti-China conspiracies. The Indian reactionaries have become the vanguard and loyal servants of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in gathering an anti-China encirclement.

To gather garbage and form an anti-China encirclement, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are closely collaborating with reactionary groups in some Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, "Malaysia," and even South Korea. In these series of counter-revolutionary activities, the Soviet revisionists have already torn off their masks, openly advocating for these butchers with blood-stained hands, and shamelessly propagating the "friendly cooperation" between the Soviet revisionists and these reactionaries.

At the same time, the Soviet revisionist traitor gang has stationed a large number of troops along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders, constantly provoking China militarily. This gang of Soviet revisionist traitors is a common enemy of the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the Asian peoples.

"In this small globe, a few flies bump into the wall. They buzz, a few cries of despair, a few sobs." The counter-revolutionary collusion intensively carried out by the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries precisely indicates the increasing strength of socialist China, the flourishing development of world revolutionary forces, and precisely exposes the weak essence of this small handful of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

The communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China points out: "No matter what garbage the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists gather, or what anti-China, counter-revolutionary 'holy alliance' they organize, they can only 'lift a stone to drop on their own feet.'"

Look! Storms rise on all five continents, and giant waves roll across the four seas. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has already sounded the death knell for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Socialist China has become a strong bastion of world revolution. The struggle against imperialism and revisionism has tempered the genuine Marxist-Leninist left-wing forces in various countries, and Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations around the world are growing and strengthening. The national democratic revolutions of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are deepening. Powerful revolutionary mass movements are constantly rising in Europe and North America. The peoples under the rule of the Soviet revisionists and their running dogs are also rising up to wage revolutionary struggles.

The anti-China, counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" concocted by the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries can only further promote the awakening of the peoples of various countries and arouse more extensive and deeper revolutionary struggles among the peoples of various countries. No matter what kind of garbage they concoct, in the end, they cannot escape the iron broom of the revolutionary people, and they will ultimately be swept into the garbage heap of history.

The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "absolutely not relaxing one's fighting will" and are standing in strict readiness. Since we were able to defeat the U.S. imperialists and their followers on the battlefield of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the past, today we are also fully capable of smashing any arrogant anti-China, counter-revolutionary alliance's war of adventure.

The wheel of history will never turn back. Imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionary forces will ultimately be thoroughly buried by the revolutionary peoples of the whole world!

    粉碎反华、反革命“神圣同盟”
    北京部队空军某部战士　万山红
    全世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    各国人民的革命运动正在蓬勃发展，全世界无产阶级和广大革命人民正在向旧世界英勇开战。
    以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修为首的修正主义和各国反动派正在进行垂死挣扎，妄想阻挡滚滚向前的革命洪流。它们勾结在一起，加紧进行反革命活动。
    苏修这一伙叛徒，出于它的反革命的本能，一心一意同美帝国主义合伙对付各国革命人民。美帝到哪里“烧香”，苏修就赶到哪里“磕头”；美帝到哪里“放火”，苏修就赶到哪里“加油”；美帝的侵略魔爪伸到哪里，哪里的人民拿起武器进行反抗，苏修就在哪里大肆贩卖“和平解决”、“政治解决”等等反革命修正主义的麻醉剂，妄想麻痹世界人民的革命意志，扑灭熊熊燃烧的各国人民的武装斗争烈火。
    美帝和苏修加强“合作”，拚命搜集垃圾，组织反华包围圈，把矛头直接指向伟大的社会主义中国。
    为了拚凑垃圾，组成反华包围圈，美帝、苏修和日本反动派，正在加紧反革命勾结，加快复活日本军国主义势力的步伐。在美帝卵翼下，日本反动派正在加速实现第三次扩军计划，日本经济加速实现军事化，军事工业生产大幅度膨胀。今年四月至九月，日本向外国销售的军需品数字已创美帝侵朝战争最后一年——一九五三年以来的最高纪录。苏修积极配合美帝扶植日本军国主义，同日本军国主义加紧全面勾结。苏修头目公开吹捧日本军国主义是什么“和平力量”，什么“亚洲的稳定力量”，真是无耻到了极点！
    为了拚凑垃圾，组成反华包围圈，美帝、苏修和印度反动派也加紧进行着新的反华阴谋。今年七月，美帝副国务卿卡曾巴赫带了一帮子所谓“中国问题专家”到了新德里，同印度反动派头子英迪拉·甘地秘密会谈，策划反华新阴谋。在这次会谈中，英迪拉·甘地曾向卡曾巴赫提出了一项在中国周围国家中，在加强“经济联系”的幌子下组织“反华联盟”的计划。这项计划，立即得到美帝头子的赞许。在这一年中，柯西金和苏修大小头目也频繁地到达新德里，策划反华反革命的阴谋活动。印度反动派已经成为美帝、苏修拚凑反华包围圈的马前卒和忠实奴才。
    为了拚凑垃圾，组成反华包围圈，美帝、苏修加紧同亚洲的一些反动派，如印尼、泰国、“马来西亚”甚至南朝鲜等地方的卖国集团勾结起来。苏修在这一系列反革命活动中，已经撕下了遮羞布，公开为这些双手沾满革命人民鲜血的刽子手张目，并且无耻地宣扬苏修同这些反动派的“友好合作”。
    同时，苏修叛徒集团还在中苏、中蒙边境驻扎大量军队，不断对中国进行军事挑衅。这一伙苏修叛徒，是中国人民、苏联人民和亚洲人民的共同的敌人。
      “小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”美帝、苏修和各国反动派加紧进行的这种反革命勾结，恰恰说明了社会主义中国的日益强大，说明了世界革命力量的蓬勃发展，恰恰暴露了这一小撮帝、修、反分子的虚弱本质。
    中国共产党八届十二中全会公报指出：“不管美帝、苏修拚凑一些什么垃圾，组织反华、反革命的‘神圣同盟’，都只能是‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。”
    看哪！五洲起风暴，四海卷巨澜。伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，已经敲响了帝、修、反的丧钟。社会主义中国已成为世界革命的坚强堡垒。反帝反修的斗争锻炼了各国真正的马克思列宁主义左派力量，世界马克思列宁主义政党和组织正在成长壮大。亚、非、拉各国人民的民族民主革命正在深入发展。欧洲和北美不断地兴起了强大的革命群众运动。苏修及其走狗统治下的一些国家的人民也正在起来进行革命斗争。
    美帝、苏修和各国反动派拚凑的反华、反革命的“神圣同盟”，只能进一步促进各国人民的觉悟，激起各国人民的更加广泛、更加深入的革命斗争。不论它们拚凑的是什么样的垃圾，到头来都逃脱不了革命人民的铁扫帚，它们终归要被扫进历史的垃圾堆里。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和人民解放军，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”的教导，正在严阵以待。我们既然在过去，在抗美援朝的战场上，能够打败美帝及其追随者，在今天，也完全能够粉碎任何不自量的反华反革命联盟的战争冒险。
    历史的车轮是决不会倒转的。帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动势力，最后一定要被全世界的革命人民所彻底埋葬！
