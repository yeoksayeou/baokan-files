The soldiers of the class where Wang Jie served before his death have linked their thoughts with the actual situation, studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, and achieved good results. The following stories vividly reflect their situation of raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines during their study.

The class where Wang Jie served before his death—Class 5 of the Engineering Battalion of a certain unit—resolutely implements Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to "learn from Comrade Wang Jie, study Chairman Mao's works actively and apply them, and devote oneself wholeheartedly to the revolution." They frequently and repeatedly discuss Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and frequently and repeatedly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. The following are stories of how they actively study and apply Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

"Wanting a Good Seat Might Lead to Wanting a Good Position"

A certain troupe came to the unit where Wang Jie served before his death to perform and have a get-together with the soldiers of Class 5. After dinner, the soldiers of Class 5 eagerly headed to the theater. There were many people coming to watch the performance. Class 5 happened to get the side seats. Some comrades muttered, "They specially came to perform for our class, why do we have to sit in the side seats?"

Upon hearing this, the other comrades in Class 5 were taken aback. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must always maintain a modest, prudent, and unassuming style of work and avoid arrogance and impatience." We are loyal to Chairman Mao, so we must understand his words one by one, reflect them in our actions, and verify them in our behavior. If today, because we are the "Wang Jie Class," we want a good seat, what will we want next?

After watching the performance, they immediately raised the issue of "seats": "In the past, when watching plays or movies, why didn't we have any objections to sitting in the side seats? Why are we so particular now? Why can't the 'Wang Jie Class' sit in the side seats?" Everyone brought these questions to heart, finding the cause from the depths of their souls and finding the answer in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are inevitably stamped with the mark of class." Comrade Wang Jie once said: "Personal life seems trivial, but the thoughts it reflects are either proletarian or bourgeois." Everyone compared this with Chairman Mao's teachings, thought about Comrade Wang Jie's self-aware revolutionary spirit, and deeply realized that the "seat" issue reflected bourgeois thoughts, which were the "arrogance, self-congratulation, complacency, and reluctance to progress" that Chairman Mao criticized, and the "selfishness" at work. The more "selfishness" there is, the less "loyalty" there is. Today, wanting a good seat might lead to wanting a good position tomorrow, and gradually one might slip onto the path of revisionism. Everyone said: "It's not the seat that's biased, but our thoughts that have deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Thus, everyone fiercely fought against this "selfishness."

Military-Civilian Joint Criticism Meeting

On the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month this year, the soldiers of Class 5 returned from labor and entered the village. Some villagers ran over to invite them to attend the villagers' family Mao Zedong Thought study class in the evening; some villagers ran over to invite them to celebrate the festival in the evening. A landlord element also chimed in, saying: "The soldiers have worked hard and achieved great results. This year, the rice harvest is bountiful, and on the Mid-Autumn Festival, they should eat and drink well." A new soldier heard this and, instead of being alert, returned to the company and eagerly said: "Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, why doesn't the company have any celebrations. Last year, when we were at home, the whole family gathered to eat moon cakes." Upon hearing this, Class Leader Xu Rumin felt that this was a reflection of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines on how to celebrate festivals, and it was an opportunity to be seized. He immediately discussed with the comrades in the class and decided to hold a military-civilian joint criticism meeting in the evening with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

After dinner, Xu Rumin led the entire class to the courtyard of an old peasant, Zhang Grandpa, who had suffered greatly in the old society. Zhang Grandpa, upon hearing that a criticism meeting was to be held, immediately recalled the bitter experiences of the old society. Zhang Grandpa said: "When I was sixteen or seventeen, I worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for over thirty years and didn't even earn a pair of cotton pants. During festivals, the landlord's family indulged in feasts, while our family had to wait until New Year's Eve to have a little tofu residue to fill our stomachs...".

Before Zhang Grandpa finished speaking, a seventy-year-old grandmother angrily criticized Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." She said: "Every grain of rice in the landlord's house is stained with the blood and tears of us poor and lower-middle peasants. In the old society, my family owed the landlord a basket of rent, and the landlord forced us to work as long-term laborers to repay the debt. After working for a year, the basket of rent was still a basket of rent. Is this 'exploitation is meritorious' and 'peasants welcome exploitation'? Nonsense! Liu Shaoqi is whitewashing the old society of exploitation and the landlord class, and speaking for the landlords."

"Liu Shaoqi is the loyal son and grandson of the landlord class, the faithful running dog of imperialism and revisionism," Xu Rumin added.

"Absolutely right. Liu Shaoqi is one of them. If he were to seize power, we poor and lower-middle peasants would suffer twice the hardship and twice the injustice. Now, Chairman Mao leads the entire nation to expose this big villain, Liu Shaoqi. We must not forget the bitterness of class struggle, not forget Chairman Mao's great kindness, not follow the old customs and habits, and forever follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution." Everyone became more angry and more excited as they criticized. They shouted in unison: "Defend Chairman Mao! Overthrow Liu Shaoqi!"

The soldiers returned to the class and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's flattery, however, may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks." Everyone said: "Tonight, we had a very meaningful festival. In the future, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, thoroughly purge all the poison spread by Liu Shaoqi, break the old and establish the new, and forever maintain a frugal and plain style of work."

"I Push the Cart for the Revolution"

The soldiers of Class 5 always carry a notebook with them, recording the bitter family history of the class comrades in the old society. Whenever they have problems in their thoughts, they take it out to look at and think about it; whenever the class's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines weakens, they take it out to read and discuss collectively. They call this: "Always grasp class education, talk about the line struggle every day. Turn class bitterness into revolutionary aspirations, and make every heart turn towards the sun."

During a thousand-mile march exercise, the class dispatched Dong Qingming to help the kitchen push the wheelbarrow. Dong Qingming thought about the complex roads, mountains, and valleys of this thousand-mile march, and the pushing of the wheelbarrow being the hardest, and hesitated for a moment. At this time, he thought of his father's tragic scene of pushing the cart for the capitalist and dying of exhaustion in the old society, and Chairman Mao's teachings about "never forgetting class struggle" and Lenin's great teachings about forgetting the past meaning betrayal, and immediately overcame the "selfishness." He said:

"In the old society, my father died of exhaustion from pushing the cart and carrying large jars for the capitalist, which was because the poor did not have the power to control the printing press and the gun. Today, to better control the gun and defend the printing press, I push the cart for the revolution. The more hardship and fatigue, the more glory."

After the march began, Dong Qingming pushed a wheelbarrow weighing three or four hundred pounds every day, running to the front of the queue to cook. After everyone finished eating and cleaned up, he pushed the cart forward again. His hands were sore from pushing, his shoulders were swollen from rubbing, his feet were blistered, and every step was excruciatingly painful. However, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." He instantly felt an endless surge of strength. He took big strides and pushed the cart forward.

Seeing that he was really too tired, the comrades went to replace him. He refused, saying: "I push the cart not relying on physical strength, but completely relying on Mao Zedong Thought, relying on a red heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

    王杰班新事
    王杰生前所在班的战士，联系自己的思想实际，学习两条路线斗争的历史，效果很好。下面的几则故事，生动地反映了他们在学习中提高路线斗争觉悟的情形。
    王杰生前所在班——某部工兵一连五班，坚决执行林副主席“向王杰同志学习，活学活用毛主席著作，一心一意为革命”的指示，对毛主席的革命路线经常讲，反复讲；对资产阶级反动路线经常批，反复批。下面记述的就是他们活学活用毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟的小故事。“要个好座位，就可能要个好地位”
    某剧团来到王杰生前所在部队，和五班的同志联欢，作慰问演出。吃罢晚饭，五班的同志兴高采烈地朝剧场走去。来看演出的人很多。五班正好摊到边排座位。有的同志一看就嘀咕说：“人家专门为我们班慰问演出，为什么让我们坐边座？”
    听到这句话，五班其他同志不禁一愕。毛主席教导我们说：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”。我们忠于毛主席，就要对毛主席的话，一字一句去理解，一言一行来体现，一举一动来检验。如果今天因为是“王杰班”了，就想要个好座位，那下一步应该要什么呢？
    看完演出以后，他们立即针对“座位”问题提出：“过去看戏看电影，为什么坐边座没有意见？为什么现在这样斤斤计较？为什么‘王杰班’就不能坐边座？”每个人都带着这些问题，从灵魂深处找原因，从毛主席著作里找答案。毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”王杰同志曾经说过：个人的生活看起来点点滴滴，但是反映出来的思想，不是无产阶级的，就是资产阶级的。大家对照毛主席的教导，想想王杰同志自觉革命的精神，深刻地认识到，“座位”问题反映出来的思想，实际上就是资产阶级思想，是毛主席批评的那种“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪”在生长，是“私”字在作怪。“私”字多一分，“忠”字就少一分，今天要个好座位，明天就可能向党要个好地位，慢慢地就会滑到修正主义的道路上去。大家说：“不是座位偏了，是我们的思想偏离了毛主席的革命路线。”于是，大家狠斗了这个“私”字。
          军民联合批判会
    今年农历八月十五日，五班的同志劳动回来，一进村，有的社员就跑来请他们晚上去参加社员们的家庭毛泽东思想学习班；有的社员跑来请他们晚上去过节。一个地主分子也凑过来说：“解放军劳苦功高，今年水稻大丰收，中秋节应当吃点喝点。”有一个新战士听了，不仅没有引起警觉，回到连里还津津有味地说：“今天是中秋节，连里怎么没有一点表示。去年咱在家的时候，全家团圆吃月饼哩。”班长徐汝明听到后，觉得这是两个阶级和两条路线斗争在过什么样的节的问题上的反映，应当抓住机会，请贫下中农给大家上一课。于是，他立即和班里同志商量，决定晚上和贫下中农一起召开一次军民联合批判会。
    吃罢晚饭，徐汝明把全班带到一位在旧社会苦大仇深的贫农张大爷的院子里。张大爷听说要开批判会，立即想起了旧社会的苦难遭遇。张大爷说：“我十六七岁就给地主扛长工，扛了三十多年，连一条棉裤也没挣上。逢年过节，地主家花天酒地，我们家大年三十才要到一点豆腐渣充饥……。可是刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼却胡说什么‘剥削有功’！”
    没等张大爷说完，七十多岁的大娘就愤怒地批判刘少奇“剥削有功”的反革命谬论。她说：“地主家的每颗粮食上都有咱贫下中农的血和泪。在旧社会，我家欠地主一斗租，地主就逼我们给他扛长工还债。扛了一年，一斗租还是一斗租。这是‘剥削有功’、‘农民欢迎剥削’吗？呸！刘少奇是在给吃人的旧社会和地主老财涂脂抹粉，是在为地主说话。”
      “刘少奇就是地主资本家的孝子贤孙，是帝国主义、修正主义的忠实走狗。”徐汝明补充说。
      “一点不假。刘少奇就是他们那边的人。如果让他掌了权，我们贫下中农就要受二遍苦，遭二遍罪。现在，毛主席率领全国人民，把刘少奇这个大坏蛋揪了出来，我们一定不要忘记了阶级苦，不要忘记了毛主席的大恩，不要去信那些旧风俗、旧习惯，要永远跟着毛主席干革命。”大家越批越愤怒，越谈越激动。齐声高呼：“保卫毛主席！打倒刘少奇！”
    战士们回到班里，又反复学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告：“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。”大家说：“今天晚上过了一个非常有意义的节日。今后我们一定要听毛主席的话，彻底肃清刘少奇散布的一切毒素，破四旧，立四新，永远保持艰苦朴素的作风。”
    “我为革命推小车”
    五班的同志有一个经常带在身边的本子，上面记载着班里同志在旧社会的苦难家史。每当思想上有了问题，他们就拿出来看一看，想一想；每当班里阶级斗争和两条路线斗争观念淡薄时，他们就拿出来集体读一读，议一议。他们把这叫做：阶级教育经常抓，路线斗争天天讲。把阶级苦凝成革命志，使颗颗丹心向太阳。
    一次千里行军演习，班里派东庆明去帮助伙房推独轮小车。东庆明想到这次千里行军，道路复杂，翻山越岭，推小车是最苦的，不禁犹豫了一下。这时，他想起了父亲在旧社会为资本家推小车累死了的悲惨情景，想起了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和列宁关于忘记过去，就意味着背叛的伟大教导，立即斗倒了“私”字。他说：
  “在旧社会，我父亲是为资本家推小车运大缸累死的，那是因为穷人没有掌握印把子和枪杆子。今天，为了更好地掌握枪杆子，保卫印把子，我为革命推小车，越苦越累越光荣。”
    行军开始以后，东庆明每天推着三、四百斤重的独轮小车，跑到队伍前头做饭。等大家吃完饭，收拾好，他又推着车子往前赶。手推酸了，肩磨肿了，脚上打了泡，每走一步都钻心的疼。但是他想起毛主席“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦”的教导，顿时全身充满了无穷的力量。他迈开大步，飞车前进。
    同志们看他实在太累了，就去换他。他拒绝说：“我推小车不是靠的体力，完全靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是永远忠于毛主席革命路线的一颗红心。”
