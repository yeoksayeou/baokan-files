Soldier Zheng Mingjin received five letters from his family in a row. This incident attracted the attention of his comrades. They recalled that recently, Zheng Mingjin had written more letters home than anyone else. Had something happened at home? Or was there an unsolvable problem? These questions were on everyone's mind. One day, Zheng Mingjin received another letter. The platoon leader and comrades went to talk to him affectionately: "Zheng, is there any difficulty at home? If there are any problems you can't solve, just tell us, and we'll help you solve them." Before the platoon leader finished speaking, Zheng smiled and said, "Platoon leader, I understand your concern. You must have seen the many letters from my family, right? Don't worry, there's nothing wrong at home." He then explained the reason for the many letters.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country, inspired by Mao Zedong's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, have launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters represented by the traitor Siu Ming-Chih. The flames of criticism are burning fiercely on all fronts. Zheng Mingjin studied Mao Zedong's teachings: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." He thought: The flames of criticism should be spread to every corner, and family letters should also become proclamations criticizing Siu Ming-Chih. He made a plan with his family, based on the new situation of the Cultural Revolution and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, to constantly and repeatedly criticize Siu Ming-Chih's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism. Through hundreds of letters, they have successively criticized Siu Ming-Chih's advocacy of the "theory of public-private fusion," the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," the "three selfs and one package," the "four freedoms," and so on. He wrote his boundless love for Chairman Mao and his deep hatred for Siu Ming-Chih into his letters. Recently, in response to the call of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee to continue to expose the crimes of Siu Ming-Chih and his accomplices of betraying the Party and the country, and to sweep away the reactionary revisionist ideology, he agreed with his family to repeatedly criticize Siu Ming-Chih's "theory of the merit of exploitation." He wrote separately to his father, mother, brother, and sister, using a large number of facts to denounce the evil system of exploitation. Saying this, he took out the letter from his parents that had just arrived and handed it to the platoon leader, saying, "Platoon leader, you can read it."

The platoon leader listened to his detailed account and nodded in approval. After taking the letter, the platoon leader became more and more excited as he read. This was not an ordinary family letter! It was clearly a cannonball aimed at Siu Ming-Chih. The letter said:

	Mingjin,

	Your letter was read by the whole family, and we all hate Siu Ming-Chih, this great traitor, to the bone. His advocacy of the fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious" is all nonsense! In the old society, I started working for the landlord at the age of fourteen and tasted all the bitterness in the world. I worked for the landlord, Wang the Glutton, for half my life, but in the end, I had no house, no land, not even a place to live. The landlord's family feasted and drank, while we poor people wandered the streets. Is this "exploitation is meritorious"? We poor and lower-middle peasants hate the evil system of exploitation to the core. Siu Ming-Chih attempts to restore capitalism, openly whitewashing the landlords, trying to make us suffer twice, we poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree!

	Child, the gun is our lifeline. Without the gun, we cannot protect our power. In the old society, we suffered because we had no gun. Now, Chairman Mao has saved us from the sea of suffering and given the printing press and the gun to the working class and us poor and lower-middle peasants to manage. You are in the army, so you must study Chairman Mao's works well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "seizing the revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness," raising revolutionary vigilance, and firmly holding the gun in your hand to forever protect our great savior and benefactor, Chairman Mao!

The platoon leader saw that at the end of the letter, there were five "Down with Siu Ming-Chih!" slogans, but the handwriting was different. The last slogan was written in a somewhat crooked manner. He asked why. Zheng Mingjin said, "The first four are written by my father, mother, brother, and sister, and the last one is written by my five-year-old little sister."

Zheng Mingjin's letter greatly educated and inspired all the soldiers in the company, greatly boosting their revolutionary spirit and deepening their profound proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. They expressed their determination to learn from Zheng Mingjin, to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the position of family letters, and to let red revolutionary family letters fly to all corners of the motherland.

    战士的家信
    解放军某部战士　阚世美　李祥生
    战士郑明进接连几天收到了家中的五封来信。这件事引起了同志们的注意，联想起最近一个时期来，郑明进给家中去信比谁都多，是家中出了什么事呢，还是有解决不了的困难呢，同志们心里都有这样的疑问。一天，小郑又接到一封信。班长和同志们就亲切地去和他谈心：“小郑，家中有什么困难吗？有解决不了的问题尽管说，大家帮助你解决。”没等班长的话说完，小郑便笑着说：“班长，你的话我明白了，你一定是看到我家中的来信多吧？你放心吧，我家中没有什么问题。”说着便谈起了信多的原因。
    自从无产阶级文化大革命以来，全国亿万军民在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的鼓舞下，向以大叛徒刘少奇为代表的资产阶级黑司令部发起了猛烈的进攻，大批判的烈火在各条战线上猛烈地燃烧着。郑明进学习了毛主席的教导：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”他就想：应该把大批判的烈火烧到每一个角落，要使家信也变成批判刘少奇的檄文。他便和家中订了个计划，根据文化大革命发展的新形势和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，经常不断地批判刘少奇复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。通过数百封家信，他们先后批判了刘少奇鼓吹的“公私溶化论”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等等。他把对毛主席的无限热爱，对刘少奇的无比仇恨，都写进家信里。最近，为响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报提出的继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行、肃清反革命修正主义思想的伟大战斗号令，他又和家中说定，要反复批判刘少奇的“剥削有功论”。他分别给父亲、母亲、哥哥、姐姐去了信，用大量的事实，控诉万恶的剥削制度。说到这里，他从兜里掏出父母刚来的信交给班长说：“班长，你看吧。”
    班长听着他一五一十的叙述，不住地点头称赞。接过了那封信，班长越看心情越激动。这哪是一封平常的家信！这分明是射向刘少奇的一颗炮弹。信中说：
    明进：
    你来的信，全家看了后，从骨子眼里都恨透了刘少奇这个大叛徒。他宣扬的什么“剥削有功”等谬论，完全是胡说八道！我在旧社会从十四岁起就被迫给地主扛长工，吃尽了人间的黄连苦。我给地主王大肚子扛了半辈子活，到头来房无一间，地无一垄，连个安身的地方都没有。地主家里花天酒地，我们穷人却流落街头。这难道是“剥削有功”吗？我们贫下中农恨透了万恶的剥削制度。刘少奇妄图复辟资本主义，公开给地主涂脂抹粉，想让我们重吃二遍苦，受二茬罪，我们贫下中农一万个不答应！
    孩子，枪杆子是我们的命根子啊，没有枪杆子我们的政权就保不住。在旧社会我们受苦，就是因为没有枪杆子。现在毛主席他老人家把我们从苦海中救出来，把印把子、枪杆子交给工人阶级和咱贫下中农来掌管，你在部队，一定要好好学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，提高革命警惕性，紧握手中枪，永远保卫咱们的大救星、大恩人毛主席！
    班长看到信的最后写着五个“打倒刘少奇！”的口号，可字体却不相同，特别最后一个口号，字写得还有些歪歪扭扭。便问这是为什么？郑明进说：“前边是我父亲、母亲、哥哥、姐姐每人写的一个，最后一个是我五岁的小妹妹写的。”
    郑明进同志的信使全连同志受到了很大的教育和启发，大大鼓舞了他们的革命斗志，加深了他们对毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情。他们表示要向郑明进同志学习，让毛泽东思想占领家信这个阵地，让红色的革命家信飞向祖国的四面八方。
