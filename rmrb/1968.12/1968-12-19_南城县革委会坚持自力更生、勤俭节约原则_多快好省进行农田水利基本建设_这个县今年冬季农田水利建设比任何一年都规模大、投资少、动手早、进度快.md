The Nancheng County Revolutionary Committee adheres to the principles of self-reliance and thrift, and is carrying out agricultural water conservancy construction in a rapid, good, and economical manner. This winter, the scale of agricultural water conservancy construction in this county is the largest, the investment is the least, the start is the earliest, and the progress is the fastest compared to any other year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 18: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Nancheng County in Jiangxi Province has achieved a leap forward in agricultural production this year. The total grain output increased by 10% compared to the highest level in 1967, and there was a bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. The public accumulation of communes and production teams has also increased significantly. In this situation, some communes and production teams, when planning winter agricultural water conservancy construction, neglected thrift, thinking that "since we have a bumper harvest, spending a bit more money doesn't matter." Some wanted to undertake large projects, believing that "the larger the project, the more funds the state should allocate," without planning for self-reliance. The county revolutionary committee seized these active thoughts and held a water conservancy work conference in late September, organizing the attending commune and production team cadres to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "thrift for revolution" and "frugal construction of the country." They severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, purged its poison, and invited advanced units that have achieved success in water conservancy construction through learning from Dazhai and self-reliance to share their experiences, providing lively and vivid education. For example, the Zhuliang Commune Lixin Brigade has not borrowed a single cent from the state in ten years. With a spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, they have waged a war against nature, achieving automatic irrigation for all farmland in the brigade, completely solving the water problem, and achieving bumper harvests year after year with per-acre yields exceeding 1,000 jin. In contrast, the Honghu Commune Xinzhong Brigade started building a reservoir in 1965, but due to relying on state investment, the project took four years to complete and has not been able to fully utilize its benefits. Through studying Chairman Mao's teachings and listening to the sharing of experiences, the attending comrades expressed their determination to act according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under this spirit, after the autumn harvest, the winter agricultural water conservancy construction projects in various communes and production teams were quickly launched.

After the revolutionary committee made arrangements for self-reliance and thrift in water conservancy construction, they also paid attention to inspections. When the county revolutionary committee discovered that some communes and production teams, in order to "boost morale," provided subsidies to water conservancy construction workers, resulting in frequent additional meals and vegetables, and some water conservancy construction sites had poor care for labor tools, they chose the Hongqi Commune's transformation of the Hongguang River project, which emphasized proletarian politics, focused on the struggle between the two lines, and promoted the rapid progress of the project, as a model. In early December, they held an on-site meeting there. The command department of this construction site held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, organized classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, and organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's series of teachings on "frugal construction of the country" and "thrift for revolution." They severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "material incentives" and "work points as the commander." This effectively raised the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the masses of workers. They carried forward the spirit of hard work, thrift, and revolution, bringing their own tools, food, and vegetables, and did not accept collective subsidies for money and food. They completed the transformation of the Hongguang River project quickly and well. The cadres attending the on-site meeting were greatly educated and inspired by the Hongguang River construction site. They returned to their respective battle stations, led the masses to focus on revolutionary criticism, and resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings to take the path of self-reliance and thrift in water conservancy construction. Many construction sites adopted measures such as sending blacksmiths, carpenters, and thatchers to the construction site, repairing tools on the spot when they were broken, making their own ammonium chloride to blast rocks when there were no stones, and using human-powered stone rollers to press the dam when there were no road rollers. Each construction site also organized a technical leadership team consisting of leading cadres, local experts, and technical personnel to be responsible for design and construction. The Gaoqiao Reservoir, by mobilizing collective wisdom, breaking foreign frameworks, and boldly modifying the original unreasonable design, adopted the method of building the dam with earth, saving about 80% of cement, steel bars, and investment.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "self-reliance" and "thrift for revolution," Nancheng County's winter agricultural water conservancy construction this year, compared to previous years, has been the largest in scale, the least in investment, the earliest in starting, and the fastest in progress. This year's water conservancy funds are similar to previous years, but the total amount of earth and stone work and the number of projects have far exceeded the great leap forward year of 1958. By mid-December, the county had completed one-third of the earth and stone work tasks, and 62 medium and small-sized projects had been completed ahead of schedule.

    南城县革委会坚持自力更生、勤俭节约原则
    多快好省进行农田水利基本建设
    这个县今年冬季农田水利建设比任何一年都规模大、投资少、动手早、进度快
    据新华社南昌十八日电　江西省南城县革命委员会遵循毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大教导，在开展冬季农田水利建设工作中，始终注意对广大基层干部和社员进行自力更生、勤俭节约的教育，努力做到少花钱多办事，不花钱也办事。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，南城县今年农业生产获得飞跃发展，粮食总产量比历史最高的一九六七年还增产一成，农、林、牧、副、渔全面丰收，社、队公共积累都有很大增长。在这种情况下，有些社、队安排冬季农田水利基本建设时，忽视了节约，认为“丰收了，多花点钱没关系”，有的要搞大工程，“工程大，国家就得多拨点款”，没作自力更生的打算。县革委会抓住这些活思想，在九月下旬召开了水利工作会议，组织到会的社、队干部认真学习毛主席关于“要节约闹革命”和“勤俭建国”的一系列教导，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒，同时，请学大寨，自力更生，在水利建设上获得成就的先进单位介绍经验，向大家进行生动活泼的教育。例如株良公社立新大队十年来，没向国家要过一文贷款，以自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神向自然开战，使全大队的农田灌溉实现了自流化，彻底解决了水的问题，年年获得大丰收，亩产超过千斤；而红湖公社新中大队从一九六五年起兴修了一个水库，由于依赖国家投资，工程拖了四年才完工，长期未能充分发挥效益。通过学习毛主席的教导，通过听取经验介绍，到会的同志表示，一定要照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事。在这一精神指导下，秋收结束后，各社、队的冬季农田水利基本建设工程即纷纷上马。
    县革委会对自力更生、勤俭节约办水利的工作做了部署以后，又注意检查。当县革委会发现有的社、队为了“鼓舞士气”，对水利施工人员给予补贴，使之经常加餐加菜和有的水利工地存在对劳动工具爱护不够的现象时，便选择突出无产阶级政治，狠抓两条路线斗争，狠抓人的思想革命化，从而促进工程进展迅速的红旗公社改造红光河的工程为样板，于十二月上旬在那里召开了现场会。这个工地指挥部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织民工大学毛主席“勤俭建国”、“要节约闹革命”等一系列教导，大批刘少奇的“物质刺激”“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，有效地提高了广大民工的两条路线斗争觉悟，他们发扬艰苦创业，勤俭节约的革命精神，自带工具、粮食和菜蔬，不要集体补助的钱、粮，把改造红光河的工程搞得又快又好。参加现场会的干部在红光河工地受到了很大教育和启发，他们回到各自的战斗岗位，带领群众狠抓革命大批判，坚决按照毛主席的教导，走自力更生、勤俭治水的道路。许多工地采取铁木篾匠上工地，工具坏了就地修，没有石块，就自制乌硝上山炸石，没有压土机压坝，就用人拉石滚子压。各工地还组织了领导干部、土专家、技术人员三结合的技术领导班子，负责设计施工。高桥水库由于发挥集体智慧，大破洋框框，大胆修改原来不合理的设计，采取土法建坝，节约了百分之八十左右的水泥、钢筋和投资。
    在毛主席“自力更生”“要节约闹革命”的伟大方针指引下，南城县今年冬季农田水利建设与历年比较，都是规模大、投资少、动手早、进度快的一年。今年水利经费与往年差不多，但总土石方和工程数都大大超过了大跃进的一九五八年。到十二月上旬，全县已完成土石方任务的三分之一，六十二个中小型工程已提前完工。
