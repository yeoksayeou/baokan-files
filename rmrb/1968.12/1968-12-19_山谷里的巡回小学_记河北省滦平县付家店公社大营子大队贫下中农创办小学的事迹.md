The Wandering Primary School in the Valley
—Recording the Establishment of a Primary School by the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Dacampzi Production Brigade, Fuzhadian People's Commune, Luoping County, Hebei Province

Dacampzi Production Brigade of Fuzhadian People's Commune in Luoping County, Hebei Province, is a deep mountain area. The entire brigade consists of 173 households residing in 13 natural villages scattered across 13 valleys, with many isolated households living one or two per location. In 1966, the poor and lower-middle peasants here, following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," established a wandering primary school, beginning to change the cultural backwardness of this area.

Previously, Dacampzi Production Brigade had no school. In 1964, the brigade established a primary school in the Lianggendi Production Team, but it was shut down in less than half a year by county and district cadres who deemed it "irregular." In the spring of 1966, the brigade launched a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants made up their minds to establish another community-run primary school in the Lianggendi Production Team. After the community-run school was established, it could only solve the problem of 30-40 children from 30-40 households in that production team attending school. Other production teams and isolated households were too far from Lianggendi, requiring them to cross several mountains and valleys, covering 10-20 miles round trip, making it inconvenient for children to attend school there. Therefore, more than 200 children in the entire brigade still could not go to school.

What to do? An old poor peasant, Shi Jun, who was over 60 years old, said, "The old school was a 'foreign' school, where students had to find the teacher; we might as well set up a 'native' school, where the teacher finds the students, going to each village to teach, so that every household's children of poor and lower-middle peasants can go to school." This revolutionary initiative immediately received the support of the brigade leadership and the poor and lower-middle peasants. Thus, the brigade selected two educated youth to take charge of different areas, visit mountain villages, and go from household to household for wandering teaching. A wandering primary school with over 40 teaching points was thus born, and 70% of the school-age children in the entire brigade were enrolled.

The two teachers of the wandering primary school were one who graduated from junior high school and one who graduated from elementary school. They were both educated youth who had been tempered by the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, full of vigor, enthusiasm, and daring. Whether in summer or severe winter, they never missed a day of carrying a small blackboard, climbing mountains, and going from village to village to teach. The poor and lower-middle peasants affectionately called them the "teachers who carry the small blackboard." They had a deep proletarian affection with the poor and lower-middle peasants. One teacher ran to seven larger concentrated points and some isolated households every day, covering 18 miles round trip to teach 69 students; the other teacher ran to another six larger concentrated points and some isolated households, covering 22 miles round trip to teach 54 students. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "Such community-run teachers are truly serving the people!"

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade entrusted their children to these two teachers for education and continuously re-educated these two teachers. When the wandering primary school was established, the poor and lower-middle peasants instructed them, "Your work is very important; it is about 'nurturing seedlings'! It is about cultivating 'laborers with socialist consciousness and culture,' so you must work hard." As soon as the two teachers took office, the brigade cadres gave each of them a copy of the "Three Articles," studying together and educating them to follow Chairman Mao's teachings to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people; to face difficulties with the resolve to "overcome all obstacles and strive for victory"; and to treat comrades with the spirit of "selflessly serving others." Especially, many old poor peasants who had suffered greatly in the old society often conducted class education for them. The son of old poor peasant Shi Jun, Shi Fushan, studied for seven and a half years in the old school but could not graduate from elementary school. The old school's teacher said he was a "stupid blockhead" who would never amount to anything. However, after joining the People's Liberation Army, he wrote home after only four months, instructing his family to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from the people of Dazhai, follow the Dazhai path, and build a new socialist mountain area. Old man Shi Jun told these two community-run teachers, "It's not that our poor and lower-middle peasants' children are not talented; it's that the bourgeois intellectuals look down on us poor and lower-middle peasants. You must fight for this honor!"

Under the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the two teachers, no matter what difficulties they encountered, remained vigorous and persistent in serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Last summer, the daughter of a poor peasant, Shi Guizhen, finished teaching in Donglongtan Village and then went to Heigouliangding Village to teach. As soon as she climbed to the back slope of the mountain, it started pouring rain. At that moment, she had the thought of not going, but she immediately remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and the instructions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and asked herself, "Facing such a small difficulty, if you retreat, can you be called a teacher of the poor and lower-middle peasants?" She shouted, "Resolutely overcome all obstacles and strive for victory," braved the wind and rain, and continued forward, arriving at Heigouliangding on time. The poor and lower-middle peasants were moved and said, "You are truly a good teacher chosen by us poor and lower-middle peasants, coming through wind and rain, wholeheartedly for us."

The wandering primary school threw out all the garbage of revisionism such as "three separations," "intellectual education first," and "grades first." The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The old school cultivated revisionist seedlings, planting the roots of revisionism. Our wandering primary school cultivates red seedlings, planting the roots of Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely cannot let the children separate from the three great revolutionary movements." Based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the two teachers set five courses: 1. Mao Zedong Thought; 2. Class struggle and current affairs; 3. Revolutionary songs; 4. Military physical education; 5. Practical writing and abacus. When teaching these courses, the teachers closely combined the situation of class struggle and the brigade's central work, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After the students learned, they tutored their families at home, thus strongly promoting the development of various political tasks in the brigade, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were very satisfied.

Some production teams in this brigade lacked accountants, so the teachers taught the students abacus and accounting based on this need. The 15 households in the fifth production team had previously had no literate members, making it difficult to record attendance and work points. Now, Zhao Huanzhong, a 14-year-old son of a poor peasant who studies at the wandering primary school, has become the accountant. With the help of the teacher, he handles recording work points and accounting very skillfully. The poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed.

Previously, due to the scattered residence and inconvenient transportation, Chairman Mao's instructions were often blocked by the capitalist roaders, and the commune members could hardly hear them or heard them very late. After the establishment of the wandering primary school, the two teachers put the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, cultivating red propagandists for the poor and lower-middle peasants, making the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin timely to meet the masses. They had a simple radio and insisted on listening to the broadcast every night. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters were issued, they immediately organized the students to study and then let the students go from house to house to propagate. On the night the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's expanded meeting bulletin was broadcast, the two teachers immediately recorded the main spirit of the bulletin, printed hundreds of propaganda materials, and brought them to the students to propagate door to door. The commune members were overjoyed to hear that the meeting decided to expel the traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi from the party forever, and they all shouted, "Down with Liu Shaoqi, defend Chairman Mao!" Currently, the more than 120 students of the wandering primary school in this deep mountain valley propagate Mao Zedong Thought at all times, thus continuously changing people's spiritual outlook.

    山谷里的巡回小学
    ——记河北省滦平县付家店公社大营子大队贫下中农创办小学的事迹
    河北省滦平县付家店公社大营子大队是个深山区，全队一百七十三户，分居在十三个自然村，大小十三条沟里，还有不少一、两户的零散居住点。一九六六年，这里的贫下中农遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示创办了一所巡回小学，开始改变这里文化落后的现象。
    大营子大队以前是没有学校的。一九六四年，大队在梁根底生产队办起了一所小学，但是不到半年，被县、区的走资派以“不正规”为名给砍掉了。一九六六年春，这个大队掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，广大贫下中农下定了决心，在梁根底生产队又创办了一所民办小学。民办小学办起来以后，还只能解决这个生产队三十几户四十多名孩子上学的问题，其他生产队和那些零散户因为离梁根底太远，到梁根底来要翻几座山，过几道梁，往返十几里、二十几里路，孩子到梁根底上学不便，所以全大队还有二百多名儿童照旧不能上学。
    怎么办？六十多岁的老贫农史均说：“旧学校是‘洋’学堂，叫学生找先生；咱们干脆办个‘土’学堂，叫先生找学生，到各村去教，让家家户户贫下中农的子女都能念书。”这一革命倡议，立即得到大队领导和贫下中农的支持。于是，大队推选出两名知识青年，分工包片，串山村，走各户，进行巡回教学。一个有四十多处教学点的巡回小学就这样诞生了，全大队的学龄儿童有百分之七十入了学。
    巡回小学的两名教员，一个是初中毕业生，一个是高小毕业生。他们都是在农村中经过三大革命运动锻炼的知识青年，有朝气，有干劲，有闯劲，不论是夏天还是严冬，一天不误地背着小黑板，踏山越岭，串村走户去上课。贫下中农亲切地称他们是“背小黑板的先生”。他们和贫下中农有着深厚的无产阶级感情。一个教员每天跑七个较大集中点和一些零散户，往返十八里路，教六十九个学生；另一个教员跑另外的六个较大集中点和一些零散户，往返二十二里路，教五十四个学生。贫下中农高兴地说：这样的民办教师，真是为人民办事啊！
    这个大队的广大贫下中农，把子女交给这两名教员进行教育，自己又不断地对这两位教员进行再教育。巡回小学一开办，贫下中农就嘱咐他们：“你们的工作很重要，是‘育苗’哩！是培养‘有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者’，一定要好好干。”两名教员一上任，大队干部发给他俩每人一本“老三篇”，和他俩一起学习，教育他们要遵照毛主席的教导，“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务；遇到困难要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”；对待同志要“毫不利己专门利人”。特别是不少旧社会苦大仇深的老贫农，随时对他们进行阶级教育。老贫农史均的儿子史福善，在旧学校念了七年半书，高小还毕不了业。旧学校的教员说他是“死木头疙瘩，念白了头发也成不了气候”。可是他参加中国人民解放军，只四个月就给家写信，嘱咐家里人要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，学大寨人，走大寨路，建设社会主义新山区。史均老人对这两个民办教员说：“不是咱贫下中农的孩子没出息，是资产阶级知识分子眼里根本看不起咱贫下中农，你们可得争这口气呀！”
    两名教员在贫下中农教育下，不论遇到什么困难，都朝气蓬勃地坚持为贫下中农服务。去年夏天，贫农的女儿史桂珍，在东龙潭村教完学，又到黑沟梁顶村去上课，她刚爬到后山坡就下起倾盆大雨来。这时，她产生了不想去的念头，但马上想起了毛主席的教导和贫下中农的嘱托，就反问自己：遇到这么一点困难，就畏缩不前，这算得什么贫下中农的教员？她喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，顶风冒雨，继续前走，按规定时间来到了黑沟梁顶。贫下中农感动地说：“你不愧是咱贫下中农选出来的好教员，风里来，雨里去，一心一意为了咱。”
    巡回小学把修正主义那套“三脱离”、“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”等乱七八糟的臭东西全都扔进了历史的垃圾堆。贫下中农说：“旧学校培养的是修苗苗，扎的是修正主义根子。我们巡回小学培养的是红苗苗，扎的是毛泽东思想根子，绝不能让孩子脱离三大革命运动。”两名教员根据贫下中农的意见，确定了五门课：一、毛泽东思想课；二、阶级斗争和时事课；三、革命歌曲课；四、军体课；五、应用文和珠算课。教员在讲这些课时，紧密配合阶级斗争的形势和队里的中心工作，宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示。学生学了以后，就在家辅导家里人学习，从而有力地推动了队里各项政治工作的开展，贫下中农很满意。
    这个大队有些生产队缺少记工员，教员就针对这个需要教学生学珠算和记账目。第五生产队十多户人家过去没有识字的，记出勤工都困难，现在由在巡回小学学习的赵焕忠当了记工员。这个十四岁的贫农儿子在教员的帮助下，记工、算账都干得很利落。贫下中农从心眼里高兴。
    过去因为这里居住分散，交通不便，毛主席的指示经常被走资派所封锁，社员根本听不见，或听见也很慢。巡回小学创办后，两名教员把宣传毛泽东思想放在首位，为贫下中农培养红色宣传员，使以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令及时和群众见面。他们自己备有一台简易的收音机，坚持每天晚上收听广播。毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令一发出，他们马上组织学生学习，然后让学生串家串户去宣传。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报广播的当天晚上，两名教员就把公报的主要精神记录下来，印成几百份宣传材料，带给学生，挨门挨户宣传。社员们一听说全会决定把刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼永远开除出党，个个欢欣鼓舞，都高喊“打倒刘少奇，保卫毛主席！”目前，巡回小学的一百二十多名小学生，在这深山老峪里，随时随地宣传毛泽东思想，因而使人们的精神面貌不断地发生着变化。
