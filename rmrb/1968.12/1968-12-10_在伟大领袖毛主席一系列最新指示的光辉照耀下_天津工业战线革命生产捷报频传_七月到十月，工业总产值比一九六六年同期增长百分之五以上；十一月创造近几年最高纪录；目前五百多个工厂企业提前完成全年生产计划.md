Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Tianjin's industrial front is reporting rapid advances in revolutionary production. From July to October, the total industrial output value increased by more than five percent compared to the same period in 1966. In November, a new high record was set for the past few years. Currently, over 500 factories and enterprises have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tianjin, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the working class of Tianjin has continuously raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, resolutely implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee. The industrial front is showing a great situation of dual victories in revolution and production.

With the emergence of the high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform, the working class of Tianjin has launched a new high tide of industrial production. From July to October this year, the total industrial output value of the city increased by more than five percent compared to the same period in 1966. In November, a new high record was set for the past few years, with an increase of 20.2 percent compared to the highest level of November 1966. Key state-planned products such as steel, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyed cloth, chemical pesticides, machine-made paper and cardboard, sewing machines, bicycles, daily-use enamel products, plasticizers, industrial boilers, bearings, paints, metal-cutting machine tools, and electrical instruments all saw significant increases, with some doubling in output.

By the end of November, Tianjin Hemp Textile Mill, Factory 641, Internal Combustion Engine Factory, Tianjin Machinery Factory, Coal Mining Equipment Factory, Synthetic Chemical Factory, Tanggu Salt Field, Hancheng Salt Field, Paperboard Factory, Medical Vehicle Factory, People's Medical Equipment Factory, Ninth People's Paper Mill, Fiberglass Factory, Daily Chemical Factory, Asbestos Products Factory, Aluminum Products Factory, Third Plastic Factory, and Balance Factory, among over 500 other factories and enterprises, have completed this year's national production plan ahead of schedule.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The Tianjin Revolutionary Committee's industrial leadership department recognizes that fully implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" is a sharp struggle between the two lines. It is necessary to eliminate interference from the right and "left" and directly pass on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the broad masses of workers. They combined the launch of a revolutionary criticism campaign with extensive discussions among the masses to make Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the idea of using revolution to guide production more deeply ingrained in people's minds.

The working class of Tianjin has deeply studied Chairman Mao's brilliant report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee, which was recently republished, and has earnestly carried out the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, promoting struggle, criticism, and reform, and developing the great situation of revolution and production on the industrial front. They used Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee as a powerful ideological weapon to carry out an in-depth revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's poisonous weed, "Tianjin Speech," which suppresses the working class and praises the bourgeoisie. Through criticism, the broad masses of workers, in conjunction with the class struggle in their own factories, studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, further raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Currently, the working class of Tianjin is making the most of the last month of the year, firmly grasping revolution and vigorously promoting production, determined to make greater contributions in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下
    天津工业战线革命生产捷报频传
    七月到十月，工业总产值比一九六六年同期增长百分之五以上；十一月创造近几年最高纪录；目前五百多个工厂企业提前完成全年生产计划
    据新华社天津电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉指引下，天津市工人阶级不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，坚决贯彻落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，工业战线上出现了一片革命和生产双胜利的大好形势。
    随着斗、批、改高潮的出现，天津市工人阶级掀起了工业生产的新高潮。从今年七月份到十月份，全市工业总产值比一九六六年同期增长了百分之五以上，十一月份又创造了近几年来的最高纪录，比一九六六年最高水平的十一月份增长百分之二十点二。国家计划的重点产品钢材、棉纱、棉布、印染布、化学农药、机制纸及板纸、缝纫机、自行车、日用搪瓷制品、增塑剂、工业用锅炉、轴承、油漆、金属切削机床、电工仪表等，在十一月份都有较大幅度的增长，有的成倍上升。
    到十一月底，已经有天津市麻纺织厂、六四一厂、内燃机厂、天津机械厂、煤矿设备厂、合成化学厂、塘沽盐场、汉沽盐场、板纸厂、医用车辆厂、人民医疗器械厂、第九人民造纸厂、玻璃钢厂、日用化学厂、石棉制品厂、铝制品厂、第三塑料厂、衡器厂等五百多个工厂企业，提前完成了今年全年的国家生产计划。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”天津市革命委员会工业领导部门认识到，全面地贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，这是一场尖锐的两条路线斗争，必须排除来自右的方面和“左”的方面的干扰，把毛主席的无产阶级革命路线直接交给广大工人群众掌握。他们结合开展革命的大批判，广泛发动群众进行讨论，使毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针和用革命统帅生产的观点更加深入人心。
    天津市工人阶级深入学习重新发表的毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的光辉报告，认真开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，推动了斗、批、改，发展了工业战线革命和生产的大好形势。他们以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为强大的思想武器，对刘少奇炮制的镇压工人阶级、吹捧资产阶级的大毒草《天津讲话》开展了深入的革命大批判。通过大批判，广大工人群众结合本厂阶级斗争实际学习两条路线斗争的历史，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟更加提高。
    目前，天津市工人阶级正在抓紧今年的最后一个月，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中做出更大贡献。
