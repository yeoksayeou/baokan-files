In the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directive, Huaning County is advancing with great strides. "It is necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade cadres and other people in the cities to send their children who have finished junior high, senior high, or college to the countryside. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Chairman Mao's latest directive swiftly spread across the land, reaching every corner of Gansu Province's Huaning County. From the foot of Panlong Mountain to the banks of the Zuoli River, the air is filled with joy. The 310,000 revolutionary people are completely immersed in unprecedented happiness and joy. People are listening repeatedly to Chairman Mao's latest directive, the important editorial note from the People's Daily, and reports about urban residents in parts of Huaning County moving to the countryside to settle down. People are cheering thousands of times for the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and are wishing thousands of times for the long life of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao! The revolutionary people in the urban areas are beating drums and setting off firecrackers, gathering under the Red Army Meeting Tower to express their determination to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao! We will definitely implement your latest directive at the fastest speed, do a better job of sending educated youth and urban residents to the countryside and mountains to settle down, and repay your great care with even greater achievements!

On this joyous day, how many people in Huaning City stayed up all night, excitedly holding Chairman Mao's latest directive, walking through the streets and alleys, spreading the word to let Chairman Mao's voice reach every heart? How many families, with multiple generations, gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, discussing the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and expressing their determination to move to the countryside and mountains to settle down. In the revolutionary committee of the town, people are signing up to go to the mountains and countryside one after another, submitting their determination letters one after another. The leader of the revolutionary leading group of the First Residents' Committee, Zhang Yu Hua, after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," made all the preparations for her whole family to move to the countryside to settle down. When she led her family and other educated youth to the settlement site at Xiaoyangying Production Brigade in Guocheng Commune, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants held up red flags, beat drums, and rushed from afar to warmly welcome the new members. The brigade leader, holding Chairman Mao's portrait with both hands, led Zhang Yu Hua's family into their new home.

Chairman Mao's voice reached Huaning No. 1 Middle School. The broad revolutionary teachers and students studied and discussed all night. All 150-plus graduating high school and junior high school students in the school signed up, determined to go to the countryside! Students from the county town took Chairman Mao's latest directive back home to persuade their parents to move to the countryside and mountains to settle down; some revolutionary parents also took Chairman Mao's latest directive to the school to persuade their children to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao's latest directive greatly inspired the broad revolutionary cadres in Huaning County. Many cadres persuaded their spouses and mobilized their children, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to prepare everything and rush to the front line of agricultural production. The cadre of the postal service in Hepan Commune, Guo Ji, originally persuaded his family to move to the countryside to settle down, but his family always said, "It's too cold now, let's wait until next spring when the weather warms up." On the night Chairman Mao's latest directive was issued, he led his family to study Chairman Mao's latest directive and decided to move to the countryside immediately. He requested the commune revolutionary committee that night to allocate a place for him, striving to realize his wish to settle down in the countryside as soon as possible.

The revolutionary committee of Huaning County, on the night the latest directive was issued, held an all-night study and discussion session and made a decision to immediately launch a high tide of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive throughout the county. They said, we 310,000 revolutionary people in Huaning County, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind," will definitely carry forward our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and continue to do a better job of sending urban residents and educated youth to the countryside and mountains. We will forever follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from victory to new victories! (According to Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou)

    在毛主席最新指示鼓舞下前进的会宁
    “知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”
    毛主席的最新指示，迅速飞越万水千山，传到了甘肃省会宁县。从盘龙山下，到祖历河畔，到处一片欢腾，三十一万革命人民完全沉浸在无比幸福和欢乐之中。人们一次又一次地收听毛主席的最新指示和《人民日报》重要编者按，以及会宁县部分城镇居民纷纷到农村安家落户的报道。人们千遍万遍地热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，千遍万遍地衷心祝愿我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！城区革命人民，敲锣打鼓，鸣放鞭炮，拥向红军会师楼下，向伟大领袖毛主席表决心：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定以最快的速度全面落实您的最新指示，进一步做好知识青年和城镇居民下乡上山安家落户的工作，以更大的成绩，报答您的伟大关怀！
    在这大喜日子里，会宁城有多少人彻夜不眠，激动地捧着毛主席最新指示，穿街走巷，奔走相告，让毛主席的声音深入人心；有多少人家老少几代在毛主席像前，畅谈毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，表示下乡上山安家落户的决心。在镇革委会里，报名上山下乡的人一个接着一个，递交上来的决心书一份接着一份。第一居民委员会革命领导小组组长张玉花，学习了毛主席的最新指示，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，做好了全家到农村安家落户的准备。当她带领全家同其他知识青年一道到达落户的郭城公社小羊营生产队时，广大贫下中农高举红旗，敲锣打鼓，从远处赶来，热情欢迎新来的社员。生产队长双手捧着毛主席像，把张玉花一家引进了新居。
    毛主席的声音传到了会宁一中，广大革命师生通宵达旦地学习、讨论，全校一百五十多名应届高中、初中毕业生，全部报名，决心到农村去！家在县城的学生，带着毛主席的最新指示，赶回家去，说服自己的爹妈，下乡上山安家落户；有些革命家长，也带着毛主席的最新指示赶到学校，动员自己的子女到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。
    毛主席的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了会宁县的广大革命干部。许多干部说服爱人，动员子女，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，做好一切准备，奔赴农业生产第一线。河畔公社邮电所干部郭吉原先动员自己的家属到农村去安家落户，家里人总是说，现在天寒地冻，等明年开春天气暖了再说。在毛主席的最新指示发表当晚，他带领全家学习了毛主席的最新指示，决定马上下乡，他连夜请示公社革委会，要求给他分配地点，争取早日实现在农村安家落户的心愿。
    会宁县革委会在最新指示发表的当晚，连夜进行了学习、讨论，并作出决定，立即在全县掀起大学习、大宣传、迅速落实毛主席最新指示的高潮。他们说，我们会宁县三十一万革命人民，遵照毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，决心发扬成绩，克服缺点，继续把城镇居民和知识青年下乡上山的工作做得更好，我们要永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线从胜利走向新的胜利！　（据新华社兰州电）
