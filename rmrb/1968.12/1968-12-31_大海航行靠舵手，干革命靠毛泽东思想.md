The winds of revolution are sweeping across the nation, and victory reports are coming in frequently. Amidst the joyous songs of the billion people of the nation earnestly implementing the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our country has successfully detonated a new hydrogen bomb. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The news spread, filling me with emotion and tears of joy. I shouted a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will surely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." The successful detonation of our country's new hydrogen bomb is a creation by the workers, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, and scientific workers engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons, who have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and overcome numerous difficulties. It fully demonstrates that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, the wisest, and the most creative. Once the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it is invincible and can create any miracle.

Last December, I returned to the warship where I had fought two years ago. The platoon leader called for a "August 6th Sea Battle"-style combat drill. Due to more than two years of hospital life, I felt a bit uncertain. However, when I heard the platoon leader loudly read Chairman Mao's great teachings, "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will vanquish all enemies and will never be subdued by any enemy," I had only one thought: "Advance without fear, vanquish all enemies, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." I cast aside the sequelae caused by my brain injury, becoming bold and agile, and completed the entire operation process in less than three minutes. My revolutionary struggle practice has made me deeply feel that sailing the seas depends on the helmsman, making revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our times and the fundamental guarantee of revolutionary victory. I will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought; learn from the proletarian class, revolutionary comrades engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, complete the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, creating new merits for the people.

    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想
    战斗英雄　麦贤得
    东风浩荡，捷报频传。在全国亿万军民满怀革命豪情认真贯彻执行党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国新的氢弹爆炸成功了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。喜讯传来，我激情满怀，热泪盈眶，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”我国新的氢弹爆炸成功，是从事核武器研制和试验的工人、人民解放军指战员和工程技术人员以及科学工作者，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，克服重重困难创造出来的。它最充分地说明了，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，最聪明，最富有创造性。战无不胜的毛泽东思想一旦掌握群众，就无往而不胜，就能创造任何人间奇迹。
    去年十二月份，我回到两年前战斗过的舰艇，中队长叫我来一次“八·六”海战式的战斗演习。由于两年多的医院生活，我心里感到有些没有底。但是，当我听到中队长高声朗读毛主席的伟大教导“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”时，我心里只有“一往无前”、“压倒一切敌人”、“排除万难，去争取胜利”，抛开了脑伤所引起的后遗症，变得志高胆大、手脚灵便，整个操作过程不到三分钟就完成了。我的革命斗争实践，使我深深体会到：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜，是革命胜利的根本。我要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想；向从事核武器研制和试验的工人阶级、革命战友学习，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，完成党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中，为人民再立新功。
