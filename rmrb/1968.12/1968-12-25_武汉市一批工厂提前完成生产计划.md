The proletariat of Wuhan, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has been inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They have deeply engaged in the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, and the industrial front of the entire city presents a great situation. A batch of factories have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule, and many factories have created the highest production level since their establishment.

The proletariat of Wuhan, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao that "the working class must lead everything," has since late August successively dispatched a large number of outstanding workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They have entered educational, cultural, medical, and scientific research units to lead the struggle, criticism, and reform of the superstructure. The workers who remain in the factories have shown tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm, seizing the revolution and promoting production, continuously improving production and creating a leap-forward scene of month-on-month and month-on-month increases. The total industrial output value of the city in October was 18.4% higher than in September, and in November it was 15.9% higher than in October. The output of many important products necessary for national construction and people's livelihood, such as the city's total power generation, steel, steel products, pig iron, machine tools, walk-behind tractors, agricultural fertilizers, bricks, sewing machines, antibiotics, enamelware, soap, and toothpaste, has all increased significantly compared to the same period last year. Factories such as the Wuhan Sewing Machine Factory, Jianghan Vehicle Factory, and Wuhan Chemical Factory have created the highest production levels since their establishment.
