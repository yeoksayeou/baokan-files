Workers Strike, Peasants Seize Estates: Latin American Laborers Brave Struggle Against Oppression

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, workers and peasants in Ecuador and Chile have recently been fighting to defend their right to live, staging strikes and seizing estates.

In Ecuador, nearly 5,000 dockworkers and employees in the major ports of Guayaquil, Manta, and Bolivar went on an indefinite strike on the 17th to protest the government's revocation of a regulation that guaranteed a minimum wage for dockworkers. This strike paralyzed transportation in these ports. The vast majority of Ecuador's peasants, unable to bear the brutal exploitation by American and local large estate owners, have risen up to seize estates. On November 14th, peasants seized the "Pañilón" estate of the American "Ecuador Company" in the province of Guayas. On the same day, the "Victoria" estate in the same province was also seized by peasants. On the 26th, hundreds of peasants seized four large estates in the province of Los Ríos: "El Tesoro," "Angélica María," "San José," and "Los Verdes."

In Chile, 5,000 employees of the American-owned Chilean Telephone Company went on strike on December 4th, demanding year-end bonuses. This telephone company, a subsidiary of the American International Telephone and Telegraph Company, controls 96% of Chile's national telephone business.

    据新华社十八日讯　厄瓜多尔和智利的工人、农民最近为了维护生存权利，不断开展罢工和占领庄园的斗争。
    厄瓜多尔瓜亚基尔、曼塔和博利瓦尔等主要港口的近五千名码头工人和职员，十七日举行不定期罢工，抗议政府取消一项规定给码头工人最低工资的法令。这次罢工使得这些港口的运输陷于瘫痪。厄瓜多尔广大农民不堪美国和本国大庄园主的残酷剥削，纷纷起来展开占领庄园的斗争。十一月十四日，农民占领了瓜亚斯省的美国“厄瓜多尔公司”的“帕尼贡”庄园。同一天，这个省的“维克托里亚”庄园也被农民占领。二十六日，数百名农民占领洛斯里奥斯省“埃尔特索罗”、“安赫利卡玛丽亚”、“圣何塞”和“洛斯维尔赫莱斯”四座大庄园。
    智利美资智利电话公司的五千名职工十二月四日举行罢工，要求发给年终津贴。这家电话公司是美国国际电话和电报公司的子公司，它控制了智利全国电话业务的百分之九十六。
