A severe financial crisis has recently struck the capitalist countries, with the franc, pound, and dollar—the three major currencies of the capitalist world—already shaky, now facing even heavier blows. The economic conditions of the imperialist countries are deteriorating, and their political and economic crises are deepening. Contradictions among them are intensifying, and imperialism led by the United States is further disintegrating.

This financial storm in the capitalist world was directly triggered by the French franc crisis. This time, the franc crisis was particularly fierce. Within a few days, the major financial centers of the capitalist countries saw a wave of selling francs and buying gold and West German marks. The French government had to dump large amounts of gold and foreign exchange to prop up the franc's position. The franc crisis quickly spread to the pound and the dollar, causing the ruling cliques of the major imperialist countries led by the United States to panic.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "We are now in an era where the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis." This is indeed the case. This financial storm in the West is a continuation and development of the most severe financial crisis in the Western world in forty years that erupted this spring. In just eight or nine months, the capitalist world has experienced two financial storms, which is a sign of the accelerating collapse of the imperialist system.

As the financial and economic crises in the imperialist countries continue to develop, the monopoly capitalist groups in Europe and North America will inevitably step up their exploitation of the working people in their own countries. This will inevitably arouse greater discontent and resistance from the people of Europe and North America. The revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America will surely rise even higher.

### 金融危机的新风暴猛袭资本主义世界

    金融危机的新风暴猛袭资本主义世界
    最近，一场严重的金融危机风暴再次猛烈冲击资本主义各国，法郎、英镑和美元这三种资本主义世界的主要货币，本来就已经根基不稳，现在又遭到了沉重的打击。帝国主义各国的经济状况普遍恶化，政治经济危机进一步加深，它们之间的矛盾越来越加剧，以美国为首的帝国主义更加分崩离析。
    资本主义世界的这场金融危机的风暴，是由法国的法郎危机直接引起来的。这次法郎危机，来势十分猛烈。几天之内，主要资本主义国家的金融中心，出现了抛售法郎抢购黄金和西德马克的风潮。法国政府不得不抛出大量黄金和外汇来支撑法郎的地位。法郎危机迅速波及到英镑和美元，使得以美国为首的主要帝国主义国家的统治集团惊慌失措。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。事情正是这样。这次西方的金融危机风暴，是今春爆发的西方世界四十年来最严重的金融危机的继续和发展。短短八、九个月里，资本主义世界连续爆发了两次金融危机风暴，这是帝国主义制度加速走向崩溃的一个标志。
    随着帝国主义国家金融危机和经济危机的继续发展，欧洲、北美各国的垄断资本集团必然要加紧压榨它们本国的劳动人民，因此也就必然地要激起欧洲、北美各国人民更大的不满和反抗。欧洲、北美革命群众运动必将有更大的兴起。
