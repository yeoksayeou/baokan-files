Editor's Note: Recently, we invited some workers, peasants, and soldiers from Tianjin and Zhangjiakou to hold international current affairs symposiums. The participants carefully studied the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and discussed the excellent international situation. They unanimously agreed that the development of the world situation fully proves the profound judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao that "the world revolution has entered a great new era." The following is a summary of their speeches:

The World Enters a New Era with Mao Zedong Thought as the Great Banner

Lang Bingjing (Worker, Zhangjiakou Oil and Chemical Factory): The seas are turbulent and the clouds are angry, the five continents are shaking with thunderous roars. Over the past year, the revolutionary tide of the world's people has surged forward. Looking at the global situation, the revolutionary momentum is limitless. The great Mao Zedong Thought is spreading widely around the world and is increasingly penetrating people's hearts. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great and decisive victories. The Albanian people are making great strides in their socialist revolution and socialist construction and have achieved new victories in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning more fiercely. The revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America are rising continuously. The peoples of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries have raised the banner of revolution and are actively fighting against the revisionist ruling cliques in their own countries. This is an era of unprecedented awakening of the revolutionary people of the world. This is an era of surging revolutionary winds. This is an era of the impending collapse of imperialism and the global victory of socialism. We, the Chinese working class and the broad revolutionary masses, enthusiastically hail the great victories achieved by the revolutionary peoples of various countries over the past year and sincerely wish them greater achievements in the new year.

A great revolutionary era needs a great revolutionary theory. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are great revolutionary theories. Our era is a new era with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as its banner. The revolutionary peoples of the world are gradually recognizing through their struggle that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light to their victory. Once theory is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful force to transform the world. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are increasingly combining with the concrete revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, powerfully promoting the development of the world revolution.

The National Liberation Movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America Are Thriving

Zhang Junqing (Representative of the Leftist Support Team of the People's Liberation Army in Zhangjiakou): Asia, Africa, and Latin America are regions where imperialist rule is weak. Since the end of World War II, national liberation movements have continuously risen in these vast regions, and this year has seen deeper development, dealing a powerful blow to imperialist colonial rule.

Armed revolution is the only correct path for oppressed nations and peoples to achieve liberation. Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is being increasingly grasped by more revolutionary people. Armed struggles of the people are thriving in the Asia, Africa, and Latin America regions. In Asia, this year has seen new developments in people's armed struggles. The Vietnamese people have achieved great victories on the battlefield of anti-American national salvation, making the American invaders frantic. The patriotic military and civilians of Laos are also fighting well. The armed forces led by the Communist Parties of Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia are frequently attacking, expanding their areas of operation, and annihilating large numbers of enemy forces. The Palestinian guerrillas have entered the areas controlled by the American imperialist tool, Israel. In Africa, the armed peoples of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola, Congo (Kinshasa), Zimbabwe, and other countries are actively operating in vast rural areas. In Latin America, the peoples of some countries are also persisting in armed revolutionary struggles.

Zhao Yuxi (Farmer, Zhangjiakou Suburb): The struggle of the peasants is an important part of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We know that the peasant brothers in India and Indonesia are fighting hard. They seize grain and land and also take up arms. In South America, the largest country, Brazil, also has peasants rising up to fight against the reactionaries. Many other countries are doing the same. The working people of the world are one family, and those who suffer hardships must unite to fight. The peasant brothers in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are doing just that. We feel that this is also a great situation.

Lang Bingjing: Revolutionary people learn and improve through struggle. The enemy becomes more cunning, and the people become more intelligent. Ultimately, "the masses are the true heroes." They have suffered enough without guns and now know the importance of guns. Now, the Americans and the Soviet revisionists want the world's people to lay down their arms, which is utterly impossible. The reactionaries want to stop the development of people's armed struggles, which is a futile wish.

The Revolutionary Mass Movements in Europe and North America Are Rising Fiercely

Wang Guangfu (Farmer, Zhangjiakou Suburb): The imperialist stronghold of Europe and North America is not a peaceful haven for monopolistic capitalists. The revolutionary storm is raging fiercely, making them sleepless.

The black people's anti-violence struggle in the United States erupted in April, sweeping through more than a hundred cities. This summer, black people in Cleveland and other places rose up again to resist violence. Currently, American blacks are brewing new struggles. The workers' strike struggles in the United States have also surged to new heights this year. The scale of the student movement in the United States is expanding. On November 5, the day of the U.S. presidential "election," American students burned the Stars and Stripes and ballots, calling on people to boycott the "election" fraud, which is unprecedented in U.S. history.

The students and workers of France, in May and June of this year, launched a mass movement of unprecedented scale since the end of World War II. The students of Italy, West Germany, Britain, Spain, and other European countries also rose up to fight, occupying schools, building barricades, and fighting with reactionary police. The students and workers of these countries support each other in their struggles, and farmers are gradually joining the ranks of the struggle.

The fierce rise of revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America reflects the deepening political and economic crises of imperialism, indicating that the oppressed peoples of these countries have extreme hatred for the capitalist system and the reactionary rule of the monopolistic capitalist groups. They will strengthen their unity, support each other, and fight together until they completely bury the evil capitalist system.

The Strength of Marxism-Leninism Is Rapidly Growing

Wang Guihua (Worker, Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory): In the great struggle of the world's revolutionary peoples against imperialism and revisionism, many true Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations have emerged in various countries and are continuously growing stronger.

The "Stalin Group" has appeared in the Soviet Union. They publish articles and distribute leaflets, calling on the Soviet working class and the broad laboring masses to rise up and overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and restore proletarian dictatorship. They speak for the hearts of all Soviet revolutionary people.

The revolutionary Communist Party of Poland is actively organizing forces and preparing for new battles to thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of the Khrushchev revisionist clique.

In the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, the revisionist ruling cliques are ruling with impunity, and the laboring masses are once again living in a state of oppression and exploitation, politically in a powerless position. They have seen through the true face of this small group of traitors from their personal experiences. Currently, the Soviet people and the Eastern European peoples are engaged in various struggles against the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys. Their struggles, together with the anti-revisionist struggles of Marxist-Leninist forces in all countries of the world, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, will surely overthrow the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys. As our great leader Chairman Mao has predicted: "The rule of revisionism will not last long."

The United States and the Soviet Revisionists Are the Common Enemies of the World's People

He Xianghong (Soldier, Certain Unit of the Zhangjiakou Garrison): Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of revolution." To actively develop the revolutionary movement of the world's people and carry it out deeply and persistently, we must identify who is the common enemy of the peoples of all countries, so as to hit the target and strike hard.

American imperialism is crazily suppressing the revolutionary movements of the world's people, attempting to dominate the world. The Soviet revisionists are frantically collaborating with the Americans, attempting to "rule the world" together and redivide the world. These two super imperialists, one invading Vietnam and the other invading Czechoslovakia, are tacitly supporting each other. Now, the revolutionary peoples of the whole world see clearly: the Americans and the Soviet revisionists are the common enemies of the peoples of the whole world, the most ferocious enemies.

To oppose the Americans and the Soviet revisionists, the common enemies, the revolutionary peoples of all countries are further uniting in their struggles, forming a broad united front. It is like a noose, tightening around the necks of the Americans and the Soviet revisionists.

Song Guocai (Representative of the Leftist Support Team of the People's Liberation Army in Zhangjiakou): The enemy will not willingly accept defeat, and the reactionaries will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. Currently, the Americans and the Soviet revisionists are colluding with each other and competing with each other, attempting to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the world's peoples and redivide the world. They are launching a frenzied counterattack, stirring up a counter-revolutionary tide in the world. There will always be twists and turns and reversals in the struggles of the peoples of various countries. There may be some people in the revolutionary ranks who waver, fall behind, or even surrender. However, the torrent of the world revolution is unstoppable by anyone, and the wheel of history will not turn back.

Over the past year, the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries have achieved great victories. This victory is only a new starting point on the road to progress. Greater struggles lie ahead. The peoples of the world are advancing in their struggles. No matter what difficulties and setbacks they encounter, they will advance according to the logic of "struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory." The desperate struggles of the Americans, the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries will not stop their advance.

The Imperialists Led by the United States Are in Deep Trouble

Zhao Junxiu (Worker, Tianjin Railway Bureau): In 1968, our great motherland is prosperous. Revolutionary committees, the new red power, have been established in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, realizing a red tide across the country except for Taiwan Province. The revolution promotes production. Our socialist construction is ushering in a new leap. Production is continuously increasing, and products are becoming more abundant. Finance and currency are more stable than ever, and people's lives are continuously improving.

Zhang Lianyou (Worker, Tianjin Cigarette Factory): Yes, China is full of revolutionary fervor, and production is booming. Take the industrial production of Tianjin City as an example. The production volume in November this year reached the highest peak in the past decade.

Zhao Junxiu: Things are scary when compared. Let's see what the capitalist world looks like!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis."

Since this spring, in just over eight months, the entire capitalist world has experienced two serious currency and financial crises. The British pound has already been devalued, and the dollar has actually depreciated. Recently, the franc has also been severely impacted. The major imperialist countries are all experiencing inflation, devalued currency, rising prices, increased unemployment, and the lives of the broad laboring masses are becoming worse and worse.

Wang Zaiquan (Worker, Tianjin Dongfanghong Shoe Factory): American imperialism has been beaten to a pulp in the Vietnam War, making its financial and economic situation even more difficult. The United States, such a country, owes foreign and domestic debts of over $380 billion, of which $357.8 billion is in public bonds. On a per capita basis, every American owes $1,800. The prices in the first ten months of this year have risen by 4%.

Zhao Junxiu: The monopolistic capitalist groups in the United States, to deceive the people, played a trick of changing horses in the presidential "election" this year, kicking out the Democrat Johnson and replacing him with the Republican Nixon. However, these two parties, these two American imperialist leaders, are like two peas in a pod. They are both agents of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, and no matter who comes to power, they are all oppressing and exploiting the people and cannot escape the deep political and economic crises.

Zhang Lianyou: The political and economic crisis of American imperialism is insurmountable. Its situation is like the saying, "pressing down the lid and lifting the cover, there's no way to handle it."

Bian Manchang (Soldier, Certain Unit of the Tianjin Garrison): Today, the entire capitalist world is in deep trouble. Britain ended last year with a foreign debt of tens of billions of pounds and this year is borrowing another $20 billion in foreign debt. It's really a broken household. France had a strike by more than ten million workers in May and June this year, which immediately reduced industrial output by tens of billions of dollars.

Zhang Lianyou: In the end, it's a matter of the system. In capitalist countries, capitalists control the means of production, everything is for profit, and laboring people are ruthlessly exploited. Capitalists also fight each other, with contradictions piled up, you punch me and I kick you. The relationship between imperialist countries is also like this. As Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism is "internally disintegrating, it is alienated from the people, it has an insoluble economic crisis."

The Soviet Revisionist Clique Is in Deep Trouble at Home and Abroad

Wang Runtian (Representative of the Leftist Support Team of the People's Liberation Army in Tianjin): 1968 is also a year when the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is in deep trouble at home and abroad, has nowhere to go, and is more isolated than ever. It is a year of complete bankruptcy of modern revisionism and a year of complete exposure of their paper tiger nature.

The Soviet revisionists have fully restored capitalism at home. Since 1966, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has been vigorously promoting the so-called "new economic system." This is to put profits first and everything for profit. At the same time, the small group of privileged classes represented by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has greatly strengthened their fascist dictatorship over the broad laboring masses. The suffering of the Soviet people is increasing, the gap between the rich and the poor in the Soviet Union is widening, and class differentiation is becoming more serious. A small group of privileged classes can arbitrarily lay off workers. It is reported that currently, out of the 110 million labor force in the Soviet Union, 12% are unemployed.

Due to the full restoration of capitalism, the Soviet economy is in unprecedented chaos, product quality is poor, and market supply is tight. Vegetables, fruits, and fresh meat are scarce and expensive. One kilogram of tomatoes sells for two rubles. An ordinary technician's monthly salary can only buy 30 kilograms of tomatoes. Not to mention ordinary workers. Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like boast about the "harvest" in Soviet agriculture and boast about "improving the welfare of residents," etc. This boasting has long been exposed.

Wang Wenxing (Worker, Tianjin Balance Instrument Factory): I am a Chinese worker and must fiercely criticize the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Soviet working class. Khrushchev and Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like are restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, burying the revolutionary achievements created by the Soviet people under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin after long-term struggles, making the Soviet worker brothers and the broad masses suffer twice, and we are extremely indignant!

Wang Fengchun (Farmer, Tianjin Suburb): Our country's agricultural production has achieved another bumper harvest this year. The suburbs of Tianjin have not had a heavy rain this year, but under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we farmers have overcome natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest, with an average rice yield of about 800 jin per mu. Chinese farmers are well-fed and clothed because we have a socialist system and proletarian dictatorship, the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, under the banner of socialism, is practicing capitalism. In the Soviet countryside, they practice "contracting to the team," material incentives, and even free trade of land. Free markets are everywhere. Collective farms have completely changed their nature, becoming genuine capitalist economies. Due to the full restoration of capitalism, Soviet agriculture has been severely damaged, resulting in the suffering of the laboring people.

Bian Manchang: The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is fully restoring capitalism at home and practicing social imperialism abroad. In August this year, the Soviet revisionists brazenly sent hundreds of thousands of troops to invade Czechoslovakia, which is a complete exposure of the ugly face of Soviet social imperialism.

The Soviet revisionists not only invaded Czechoslovakia but also sent their troops into Bulgaria to control it. They also sent their fleet into the Mediterranean, further threatening the security of the socialist peoples of Albania and the Balkan countries. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is a bunch of new czars riding on the necks of the Soviet people and the peoples of some Eastern European countries, and a ferocious enemy of the Soviet people and the peoples of Eastern European countries.

Wang Runtian: The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia has stripped off all its beautiful clothes and masks, so this is the complete bankruptcy of the Soviet revisionists. The conspiracy of the Americans and the Soviet revisionists to collude and attempt to redivide the world has also been completely exposed to the people of the world. The Americans and the Soviet revisionists, the common enemies of the world's people, actually recognize each other's spheres of influence and engage in extremely dirty political deals.

Zhao Junxiu: This year, the Soviet revisionists have intensified their collusion with the Americans and done a series of treacherous acts against the world revolution. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, they have done even more treacherous acts against the Vietnamese people. On the Vietnamese issue, the Soviet revisionists and the Americans are intensifying their collusion, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war. But this will not succeed. The world belongs to the people, and victory belongs to the people.

Wang Zaiquan: The communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party points out: "The barefaced aggression of the Americans and the Soviet revisionists has deepened the internal contradictions of the imperialist clique and the revisionist clique, promoted the awakening of the oppressed masses in the Americans and the Soviet revisionists, and at the same time is stirring up a new great wave of struggle against the Americans and the Soviet revisionists by the proletariat and the broad masses of the world."

This is very correct. The past year was a year of great victories in the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. In 1969, the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the peoples of the world, including the American and Soviet peoples, will achieve even greater victories.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The future world must be a world of the people." The world belongs to the people, and victory belongs to the people. This is definite and beyond doubt. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, definitely build socialist China into an even stronger country, and definitely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, fulfilling our sacred internationalist duty of the proletariat.

Bian Manchang: This year, the Soviet revisionists have intensified their conspiracy with the Americans to form an anti-China encirclement in Asia. The Soviet revisionists are eagerly colluding with the imperialist lackeys and running dogs such as India, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and "Malaysia," pointing their spears at the great socialist China. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is even gathering troops on the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders and frequently provoking us militarily. This fact reflects the strength of socialist China and the desperate struggles of the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary clique. We must sternly warn the Americans and the Soviet revisionists that no matter what garbage they gather or what kind of anti-China, anti-revolutionary "holy alliance" they form, in the end, they will only "lift a rock to drop on their own feet." If they dare to invade our sacred territory, then the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely not let them off, and will definitely smash the invaders to pieces and annihilate them completely!

Wang Runtian: In the coming 1969, the situation of the world revolution will be even better than this year. Our socialist motherland will become even more prosperous and powerful. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries will become even more vigorous, broader, and deeper. While the Americans and the Soviet revisionists will be even more isolated, in deeper trouble, and with nowhere to go.

Wang Fengchun: Looking forward to the future, we are full of confidence. Facing the excellent situation at home and abroad, our hearts are particularly moved. We, the Chinese people, will forever be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever firmly defend proletarian dictatorship, and forever support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

The proletariat and revolutionary people of the world, unite! Thoroughly smash imperialism, revisionism, and reaction! Build a bright new world!
