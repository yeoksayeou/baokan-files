Editor's Note: Recently, we invited some workers, peasants, and soldiers from Tianjin and Zhangjiakou to hold international current affairs symposiums. The participants carefully studied the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and discussed the excellent international situation. They unanimously agreed that the development of the world situation fully proves the profound judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao that "the world revolution has entered a great new era." The following is a summary of their speeches:

The World Enters a New Era with Mao Zedong Thought as the Great Banner

Lang Bingjing (Worker, Zhangjiakou Oil and Chemical Factory): The seas are turbulent and the clouds are angry, the five continents are shaking with thunderous roars. Over the past year, the revolutionary tide of the world's people has surged forward. Looking at the global situation, the revolutionary momentum is limitless. The great Mao Zedong Thought is spreading widely around the world and is increasingly penetrating people's hearts. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great and decisive victories. The Albanian people are making great strides in their socialist revolution and socialist construction and have achieved new victories in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning more fiercely. The revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America are rising continuously. The peoples of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries have raised the banner of revolution and are actively fighting against the revisionist ruling cliques in their own countries. This is an era of unprecedented awakening of the revolutionary people of the world. This is an era of surging revolutionary winds. This is an era of the impending collapse of imperialism and the global victory of socialism. We, the Chinese working class and the broad revolutionary masses, enthusiastically hail the great victories achieved by the revolutionary peoples of various countries over the past year and sincerely wish them greater achievements in the new year.

A great revolutionary era needs a great revolutionary theory. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are great revolutionary theories. Our era is a new era with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as its banner. The revolutionary peoples of the world are gradually recognizing through their struggle that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light to their victory. Once theory is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful force to transform the world. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are increasingly combining with the concrete revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, powerfully promoting the development of the world revolution.

The National Liberation Movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America Are Thriving

Zhang Junqing (Representative of the Leftist Support Team of the People's Liberation Army in Zhangjiakou): Asia, Africa, and Latin America are regions where imperialist rule is weak. Since the end of World War II, national liberation movements have continuously risen in these vast regions, and this year has seen deeper development, dealing a powerful blow to imperialist colonial rule.

Armed revolution is the only correct path for oppressed nations and peoples to achieve liberation. Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is being increasingly grasped by more revolutionary people. Armed struggles of the people are thriving in the Asia, Africa, and Latin America regions. In Asia, this year has seen new developments in people's armed struggles. The Vietnamese people have achieved great victories on the battlefield of anti-American national salvation, making the American invaders frantic. The patriotic military and civilians of Laos are also fighting well. The armed forces led by the Communist Parties of Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia are frequently attacking, expanding their areas of operation, and annihilating large numbers of enemy forces. The Palestinian guerrillas have entered the areas controlled by the American imperialist tool, Israel. In Africa, the armed peoples of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola, Congo (Kinshasa), Zimbabwe, and other countries are actively operating in vast rural areas. In Latin America, the peoples of some countries are also persisting in armed revolutionary struggles.

Zhao Yuxi (Farmer, Zhangjiakou Suburb): The struggle of the peasants is an important part of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We know that the peasant brothers in India and Indonesia are fighting hard. They seize grain and land and also take up arms. In South America, the largest country, Brazil, also has peasants rising up to fight against the reactionaries. Many other countries are doing the same. The working people of the world are one family, and those who suffer hardships must unite to fight. The peasant brothers in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are doing just that. We feel that this is also a great situation.

Lang Bingjing: Revolutionary people learn and improve through struggle. The enemy becomes more cunning, and the people become more intelligent. Ultimately, "the masses are the true heroes." They have suffered enough without guns and now know the importance of guns. Now, the Americans and the Soviet revisionists want the world's people to lay down their arms, which is utterly impossible. The reactionaries want to stop the development of people's armed struggles, which is a futile wish.

The Revolutionary Mass Movements in Europe and North America Are Rising Fiercely

Wang Guangfu (Farmer, Zhangjiakou Suburb): The imperialist stronghold of Europe and North America is not a peaceful haven for monopolistic capitalists. The revolutionary storm is raging fiercely, making them sleepless.

The black people's anti-violence struggle in the United States erupted in April, sweeping through more than a hundred cities. This summer, black people in Cleveland and other places rose up again to resist violence. Currently, American blacks are brewing new struggles. The workers' strike struggles in the United States have also surged to new heights this year. The scale of the student movement in the United States is expanding. On November 5, the day of the U.S. presidential "election," American students burned the Stars and Stripes and ballots, calling on people to boycott the "election" fraud, which is unprecedented in U.S. history.

The students and workers of France, in May and June of this year, launched a mass movement of unprecedented scale since the end of World War II. The students of Italy, West Germany, Britain, Spain, and other European countries also rose up to fight, occupying schools, building barricades, and fighting with reactionary police. The students and workers of these countries support each other in their struggles, and farmers are gradually joining the ranks of the struggle.

The fierce rise of revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America reflects the deepening political and economic crises of imperialism, indicating that the oppressed peoples of these countries have extreme hatred for the capitalist system and the reactionary rule of the monopolistic capitalist groups. They will strengthen their unity, support each other, and fight together until they completely bury the evil capitalist system.

The Strength of Marxism-Leninism Is Rapidly Growing

Wang Guihua (Worker, Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory): In the great struggle of the world's revolutionary peoples against imperialism and revisionism, many true Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations have emerged in various countries and are continuously growing stronger.

The "Stalin Group" has appeared in the Soviet Union. They publish articles and distribute leaflets, calling on the Soviet working class and the broad laboring masses to rise up and overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and restore proletarian dictatorship. They speak for the hearts of all Soviet revolutionary people.

The revolutionary Communist Party of Poland is actively organizing forces and preparing for new battles to thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of the Khrushchev revisionist clique.

In the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, the revisionist ruling cliques are ruling with impunity, and the laboring masses are once again living in a state of oppression and exploitation, politically in a powerless position. They have seen through the true face of this small group of traitors from their personal experiences. Currently, the Soviet people and the Eastern European peoples are engaged in various struggles against the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys. Their struggles, together with the anti-revisionist struggles of Marxist-Leninist forces in all countries of the world, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, will surely overthrow the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys. As our great leader Chairman Mao has predicted: "The rule of revisionism will not last long."

The United States and the Soviet Revisionists Are the Common Enemies of the World's People

He Xianghong (Soldier, Certain Unit of the Zhangjiakou Garrison): Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of revolution." To actively develop the revolutionary movement of the world's people and carry it out deeply and persistently, we must identify who is the common enemy of the peoples of all countries, so as to hit the target and strike hard.

American imperialism is crazily suppressing the revolutionary movements of the world's people, attempting to dominate the world. The Soviet revisionists are frantically collaborating with the Americans, attempting to "rule the world" together and redivide the world. These two super imperialists, one invading Vietnam and the other invading Czechoslovakia, are tacitly supporting each other. Now, the revolutionary peoples of the whole world see clearly: the Americans and the Soviet revisionists are the common enemies of the peoples of the whole world, the most ferocious enemies.

To oppose the Americans and the Soviet revisionists, the common enemies, the revolutionary peoples of all countries are further uniting in their struggles, forming a broad united front. It is like a noose, tightening around the necks of the Americans and the Soviet revisionists.

Song Guocai (Representative of the Leftist Support Team of the People's Liberation Army in Zhangjiakou): The enemy will not willingly accept defeat, and the reactionaries will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. Currently, the Americans and the Soviet revisionists are colluding with each other and competing with each other, attempting to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the world's peoples and redivide the world. They are launching a frenzied counterattack, stirring up a counter-revolutionary tide in the world. There will always be twists and turns and reversals in the struggles of the peoples of various countries. There may be some people in the revolutionary ranks who waver, fall behind, or even surrender. However, the torrent of the world revolution is unstoppable by anyone, and the wheel of history will not turn back.

Over the past year, the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries have achieved great victories. This victory is only a new starting point on the road to progress. Greater struggles lie ahead. The peoples of the world are advancing in their struggles. No matter what difficulties and setbacks they encounter, they will advance according to the logic of "struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory." The desperate struggles of the Americans, the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries will not stop their advance.

The Imperialists Led by the United States Are in Deep Trouble

Zhao Junxiu (Worker, Tianjin Railway Bureau): In 1968, our great motherland is prosperous. Revolutionary committees, the new red power, have been established in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, realizing a red tide across the country except for Taiwan Province. The revolution promotes production. Our socialist construction is ushering in a new leap. Production is continuously increasing, and products are becoming more abundant. Finance and currency are more stable than ever, and people's lives are continuously improving.

Zhang Lianyou (Worker, Tianjin Cigarette Factory): Yes, China is full of revolutionary fervor, and production is booming. Take the industrial production of Tianjin City as an example. The production volume in November this year reached the highest peak in the past decade.

Zhao Junxiu: Things are scary when compared. Let's see what the capitalist world looks like!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis."

Since this spring, in just over eight months, the entire capitalist world has experienced two serious currency and financial crises. The British pound has already been devalued, and the dollar has actually depreciated. Recently, the franc has also been severely impacted. The major imperialist countries are all experiencing inflation, devalued currency, rising prices, increased unemployment, and the lives of the broad laboring masses are becoming worse and worse.

Wang Zaiquan (Worker, Tianjin Dongfanghong Shoe Factory): American imperialism has been beaten to a pulp in the Vietnam War, making its financial and economic situation even more difficult. The United States, such a country, owes foreign and domestic debts of over $380 billion, of which $357.8 billion is in public bonds. On a per capita basis, every American owes $1,800. The prices in the first ten months of this year have risen by 4%.

Zhao Junxiu: The monopolistic capitalist groups in the United States, to deceive the people, played a trick of changing horses in the presidential "election" this year, kicking out the Democrat Johnson and replacing him with the Republican Nixon. However, these two parties, these two American imperialist leaders, are like two peas in a pod. They are both agents of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, and no matter who comes to power, they are all oppressing and exploiting the people and cannot escape the deep political and economic crises.

Zhang Lianyou: The political and economic crisis of American imperialism is insurmountable. Its situation is like the saying, "pressing down the lid and lifting the cover, there's no way to handle it."

Bian Manchang (Soldier, Certain Unit of the Tianjin Garrison): Today, the entire capitalist world is in deep trouble. Britain ended last year with a foreign debt of tens of billions of pounds and this year is borrowing another $20 billion in foreign debt. It's really a broken household. France had a strike by more than ten million workers in May and June this year, which immediately reduced industrial output by tens of billions of dollars.

Zhang Lianyou: In the end, it's a matter of the system. In capitalist countries, capitalists control the means of production, everything is for profit, and laboring people are ruthlessly exploited. Capitalists also fight each other, with contradictions piled up, you punch me and I kick you. The relationship between imperialist countries is also like this. As Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism is "internally disintegrating, it is alienated from the people, it has an insoluble economic crisis."

The Soviet Revisionist Clique Is in Deep Trouble at Home and Abroad

Wang Runtian (Representative of the Leftist Support Team of the People's Liberation Army in Tianjin): 1968 is also a year when the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is in deep trouble at home and abroad, has nowhere to go, and is more isolated than ever. It is a year of complete bankruptcy of modern revisionism and a year of complete exposure of their paper tiger nature.

The Soviet revisionists have fully restored capitalism at home. Since 1966, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has been vigorously promoting the so-called "new economic system." This is to put profits first and everything for profit. At the same time, the small group of privileged classes represented by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has greatly strengthened their fascist dictatorship over the broad laboring masses. The suffering of the Soviet people is increasing, the gap between the rich and the poor in the Soviet Union is widening, and class differentiation is becoming more serious. A small group of privileged classes can arbitrarily lay off workers. It is reported that currently, out of the 110 million labor force in the Soviet Union, 12% are unemployed.

Due to the full restoration of capitalism, the Soviet economy is in unprecedented chaos, product quality is poor, and market supply is tight. Vegetables, fruits, and fresh meat are scarce and expensive. One kilogram of tomatoes sells for two rubles. An ordinary technician's monthly salary can only buy 30 kilograms of tomatoes. Not to mention ordinary workers. Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like boast about the "harvest" in Soviet agriculture and boast about "improving the welfare of residents," etc. This boasting has long been exposed.

Wang Wenxing (Worker, Tianjin Balance Instrument Factory): I am a Chinese worker and must fiercely criticize the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Soviet working class. Khrushchev and Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like are restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, burying the revolutionary achievements created by the Soviet people under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin after long-term struggles, making the Soviet worker brothers and the broad masses suffer twice, and we are extremely indignant!

Wang Fengchun (Farmer, Tianjin Suburb): Our country's agricultural production has achieved another bumper harvest this year. The suburbs of Tianjin have not had a heavy rain this year, but under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we farmers have overcome natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest, with an average rice yield of about 800 jin per mu. Chinese farmers are well-fed and clothed because we have a socialist system and proletarian dictatorship, the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, under the banner of socialism, is practicing capitalism. In the Soviet countryside, they practice "contracting to the team," material incentives, and even free trade of land. Free markets are everywhere. Collective farms have completely changed their nature, becoming genuine capitalist economies. Due to the full restoration of capitalism, Soviet agriculture has been severely damaged, resulting in the suffering of the laboring people.

Bian Manchang: The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is fully restoring capitalism at home and practicing social imperialism abroad. In August this year, the Soviet revisionists brazenly sent hundreds of thousands of troops to invade Czechoslovakia, which is a complete exposure of the ugly face of Soviet social imperialism.

The Soviet revisionists not only invaded Czechoslovakia but also sent their troops into Bulgaria to control it. They also sent their fleet into the Mediterranean, further threatening the security of the socialist peoples of Albania and the Balkan countries. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is a bunch of new czars riding on the necks of the Soviet people and the peoples of some Eastern European countries, and a ferocious enemy of the Soviet people and the peoples of Eastern European countries.

Wang Runtian: The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia has stripped off all its beautiful clothes and masks, so this is the complete bankruptcy of the Soviet revisionists. The conspiracy of the Americans and the Soviet revisionists to collude and attempt to redivide the world has also been completely exposed to the people of the world. The Americans and the Soviet revisionists, the common enemies of the world's people, actually recognize each other's spheres of influence and engage in extremely dirty political deals.

Zhao Junxiu: This year, the Soviet revisionists have intensified their collusion with the Americans and done a series of treacherous acts against the world revolution. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, they have done even more treacherous acts against the Vietnamese people. On the Vietnamese issue, the Soviet revisionists and the Americans are intensifying their collusion, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war. But this will not succeed. The world belongs to the people, and victory belongs to the people.

Wang Zaiquan: The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party points out: "The barefaced aggression of the Americans and the Soviet revisionists has deepened the internal contradictions of the imperialist clique and the revisionist clique, promoted the awakening of the oppressed masses in the Americans and the Soviet revisionists, and at the same time is stirring up a new great wave of struggle against the Americans and the Soviet revisionists by the proletariat and the broad masses of the world."

This is very correct. The past year was a year of great victories in the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. In 1969, the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the peoples of the world, including the American and Soviet peoples, will achieve even greater victories.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The future world must be a world of the people." The world belongs to the people, and victory belongs to the people. This is definite and beyond doubt. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, definitely build socialist China into an even stronger country, and definitely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, fulfilling our sacred internationalist duty of the proletariat.

Bian Manchang: This year, the Soviet revisionists have intensified their conspiracy with the Americans to form an anti-China encirclement in Asia. The Soviet revisionists are eagerly colluding with the imperialist lackeys and running dogs such as India, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and "Malaysia," pointing their spears at the great socialist China. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is even gathering troops on the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders and frequently provoking us militarily. This fact reflects the strength of socialist China and the desperate struggles of the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary clique. We must sternly warn the Americans and the Soviet revisionists that no matter what garbage they gather or what kind of anti-China, anti-revolutionary "holy alliance" they form, in the end, they will only "lift a rock to drop on their own feet." If they dare to invade our sacred territory, then the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely not let them off, and will definitely smash the invaders to pieces and annihilate them completely!

Wang Runtian: In the coming 1969, the situation of the world revolution will be even better than this year. Our socialist motherland will become even more prosperous and powerful. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries will become even more vigorous, broader, and deeper. While the Americans and the Soviet revisionists will be even more isolated, in deeper trouble, and with nowhere to go.

Wang Fengchun: Looking forward to the future, we are full of confidence. Facing the excellent situation at home and abroad, our hearts are particularly moved. We, the Chinese people, will forever be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever firmly defend proletarian dictatorship, and forever support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

The proletariat and revolutionary people of the world, unite! Thoroughly smash imperialism, revisionism, and reaction! Build a bright new world!

### 敌人一天天烂下去  我们一天天好起来

专栏：

    敌人一天天烂下去  我们一天天好起来
    编者按：最近，我们分别在天津和张家口邀请一些工人、农民、解放军指战员，举行了国际时事座谈会。参加座谈的同志，认真学习了党的八届十二中全会的公报，畅谈了国际上的一片大好形势。他们一致认为，世界形势的发展，充分证明伟大领袖毛主席关于“世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代”的英明论断。现在把他们的发言摘要发表如下：
    世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代
    郎秉敬（张家口油脂化工厂工人）：四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。一年来，世界人民革命的洪流汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。放眼全球，革命形势无限好。伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界广泛地传播，日益深入人心。中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的决定性的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上大踏步地前进，在反帝反修的斗争中取得了新的胜利。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的武装斗争烈火越烧越旺。欧洲、北美的革命群众运动不断高涨。苏联和东欧一些国家的人民举起革命的大旗，积极进行反对本国修正主义统治集团的斗争。这是世界革命人民空前觉醒的时代。这是人民革命风起云涌的时代。这是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。我们中国工人阶级和广大革命群众，热烈欢呼世界各国革命人民一年来所取得的伟大胜利，并衷心祝愿他们在新的一年中取得更大的成就。
    伟大的革命时代需要伟大的革命理论。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是伟大的革命理论。我们这个时代，是以伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为旗帜的新时代。世界各国革命人民，从他们的斗争实践中，逐步认识到毛泽东思想是他们走向胜利的指路明灯。理论一旦掌握群众，就会变成强大的改造世界的物质力量。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想日益同各国人民革命斗争的具体实践相结合，有力地推动世界革命向前发展。
   亚非拉民族解放运动蓬勃发展
   张俊清（张家口解放军支左部队代表）：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，是帝国主义统治薄弱的地区。第二次世界大战以后，这个广大地区的民族解放运动不断兴起，今年以来有了更深入的发展，给帝国主义殖民统治以有力的打击。
    武装革命是被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的唯一正确的道路。毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想，被越来越多的革命人民所掌握。人民武装斗争正在亚非拉地区蓬勃发展。在亚洲，今年人民武装斗争有了新的发展。越南人民在抗美救国战场上取得伟大胜利，把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额。老挝爱国军民也打得很好。缅共、泰共、印尼共领导下的武装力量，频频出击，扩大了作战地区，消灭了敌人大量的有生力量。巴勒斯坦游击队打进了美帝侵略工具以色列的统治地区。非洲的几内亚（比绍）、莫三鼻给、安哥拉、刚果（金）、津巴布韦等国，人民武装在广大的农村地区积极活动。在拉丁美洲，一些国家的人民也在坚持革命的武装斗争。
    赵玉喜（张家口郊区农民）：农民斗争是亚非拉民族解放运动的重要部分。咱知道：印度、印尼的农民兄弟干得挺欢，他们夺粮夺地，也拿起枪杆子。南美洲那个顶大的巴西，也有农民起来跟反动派干仗。其他许多国家也这样。天下劳动人民是一家，过苦日子的人都要团结起来斗争。亚非拉许多国家的农民兄弟正是这样干的。咱觉得，这也是大好形势。
    郎秉敬：革命的人民在斗争中学习，在斗争中提高。敌人越来越狡猾，人民也越来越聪明。归根到底，“群众是真正的英雄”。他们过去吃尽没有枪杆子的苦头，知道了枪杆子的重要。现在，美帝、苏修要世界人民放下武器，是根本办不到的。反动派想要阻止人民武装斗争的发展，那是痴心妄想。欧洲北美革命群众运动猛烈兴起
    王光夫（张家口郊区农民）：帝国主义的老窝欧洲、北美，也不是垄断资本家平静的天堂。人民革命风暴猛烈兴起，刮得他们睡不好觉。
    今年四月爆发的美国黑人抗暴斗争，席卷了一百几十个大小城市。今年夏天，克利夫兰等地黑人再一次起来抗暴；目前，美国黑人又在酝酿新的斗争。美国工人的罢工斗争今年也出现新高涨。美国学生运动发展的规模越来越大。十一月五日，美国总统“选举”的这一天，美国学生烧毁星条旗和选票，号召人民抵制“选举”骗局，这在美国历史上是破天荒头一遭。
    法国学生和工人，今年五、六月间掀起了一场战后以来空前规模的群众运动的伟大革命风暴。意大利、西德、英国、西班牙和欧洲其他国家的学生也纷纷起来斗争，占领学校，筑起街垒，同反动军警进行搏斗。这些国家的学生和工人在斗争中互相支持，农民也逐渐加入斗争的行列。
    欧洲、北美革命群众运动的蓬勃兴起，反映了帝国主义政治经济危机的日益深刻化，说明了这些国家的被压迫人民对于资本主义制度和垄断资本集团的反动统治是极端仇恨的。他们必将加强团结，互相支援，共同战斗，直至最后完全埋葬万恶的资本主义制度。马克思列宁主义力量迅速成长
    王桂华（张家口卷烟厂工人）：在世界革命人民反帝反修的伟大斗争中，世界各国出现了许多真正的马列主义政党和组织，并且不断发展壮大。
    苏联出现了“斯大林小组”。他们发表文章，散发传单，号召苏联工人阶级和广大劳动人民起来推翻苏修叛徒集团的统治，重建无产阶级专政。他们说出了全体苏联革命人民的心里话。
    革命的波兰共产党正在积极进行活动，组织力量，准备迎接新的战斗，以便彻底推翻哥穆尔卡修正主义集团的反动统治。
    在苏联和东欧的一些国家，修正主义统治集团作威作福，劳动人民重新过着受压迫、受剥削的苦日子，政治上处于无权的地位。他们从自己的亲身经历中看清了这一小撮叛徒的真面目。目前，苏联人民和东欧人民，正在进行各种斗争，反对苏修叛徒集团及其仆从的反动统治。他们的斗争，和全世界各国马列主义力量的反修斗争汇合在一起，同世界各国人民的革命斗争汇合在一起，必将彻底打倒苏修叛徒集团和它的仆从。就象我们伟大领袖毛主席所预言的那样：“修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”美帝、苏修是世界人民的共同敌人
    何相洪（张家口驻军某部战士）：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”要积极开展世界人民革命运动，并把革命运动深入、持久地进行下去，就必须认清谁是世界各国人民的共同敌人，才能对准目标，狠打狠揍。
    美帝国主义疯狂地镇压世界人民革命运动，妄图称霸世界。苏修则拚命跟美帝合作，企图和它一起“主宰世界”，重新瓜分世界。这两个头号帝国主义，一个侵略越南，一个出兵捷克斯洛伐克，互相默契，互相支持。现在，全世界革命人民都看得很清楚：美帝和苏修是全世界人民共同的敌人，是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    为了反对美帝、苏修这两个共同的敌人，世界各国革命人民在斗争中正在进一步团结起来，结成广泛的统一战线。它象一根绞索，套在美帝、苏修的脖子上，越勒越紧。
    宋国才（张家口解放军支左部队代表）：敌人是不会甘心失败的，反动派决不会自行退出历史舞台。目前，美帝、苏修正在互相勾结，又互相争夺，妄图把世界人民革命斗争压下去，由它们重新瓜分世界。它们进行疯狂反扑，在世界范围内掀起了一股反革命逆流。各国人民的斗争中总会有这样或那样的曲折和反复。在革命队伍中，可能会有一些人动摇、落伍甚至投降。但是世界革命运动的洪流是任何人也阻挡不了的，历史的车轮是不会倒转的。
    一年来，世界各国人民革命斗争取得了伟大的胜利。这个胜利，仅仅是前进道路上的一个新的起点。更加伟大的斗争还在后头。世界人民在斗争中前进。不管他们会遇到什么困难、挫折，但是总会按照“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利”的逻辑向前迈进。美帝、苏修和各国反动派的拚死斗争，都阻挡不住他们前进的步伐。以美国为首的帝国主义困难重重
    赵俊修（天津铁路局工人）：一九六八年，我们伟大的祖国欣欣向荣。全国二十九个省、市、自治区建立了新的红色政权——革命委员会，实现了除台湾省以外的全国一片红。革命推动生产。我国的社会主义建设正在出现新的飞跃。生产不断提高，产品不断丰富。财政金融空前稳定，人民生活不断改善。
    张连友（天津卷烟厂工人）：是啊，我们中国是革命热气腾腾，生产蒸蒸日上。拿我们天津市的工业生产来说，今年十一月份产量上升的幅度达到了十年来的最高峰。
    赵俊修：事情是怕对比的。看看资本主义世界是个什么样子吧！
    毛主席教导说：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。
    今年春天以来，在短短八个多月之内，整个资本主义世界就连续爆发了两次严重的货币金融危机。英国的钞票早就宣布跌价了，美元实际上也落了价。最近，法郎又受到很大冲击。主要的几个帝国主义国家，都是通货膨胀，钞票不值钱，物价上升，失业增加，广大劳动人民的生活越来越糟糕。
    王在泉（天津东方红胶鞋厂工人）：美帝国主义在侵越战争中，被越南人民打得焦头烂额，使得财政经济更加困难。美国这样一个国家欠内外债三千八百多亿美元，其中发公债三千五百七十八亿美元，按人头算，每一个美国人要负担一千八百美元。今年头十个月的物价又上涨了百分之四。
    赵俊修：美国垄断资本集团为了欺骗人民，在今年的总统“选举”中，来一个换马的把戏，把民主党的约翰逊踢开，换上了共和党的尼克松。但是，这两个党，这两个美帝头子，叫做杏熬窝瓜一色货。他们都是垄断资产阶级的代理人，不管谁上台，都是压迫剥削人民的，都休想逃脱深重的政治经济危机。
    张连友：美帝国主义的政治经济危机是克服不了的。它的处境就象是俗话所说，按住葫芦起了瓢，没法办。
    边满仓（天津驻军某部战士）：今天，整个资本主义世界都是困难重重。英国去年年终背上了二、三十亿英镑的外债，今年又伸手要借二十亿美元的外债。真是一个破落户。法国今年五、六月一千多万工人大罢工，一下子就使工业产值减少了几十亿美元。
    张连友：归根结底，这是社会制度的问题。在资本主义国家，资本家掌握生产资料，一切为了赚钱，残酷地压榨剥削劳动人民。资本家之间又互相倾轧，矛盾重重，你打我一拳，我踹你一脚。帝国主义国家之间的关系也是这样。正如毛主席所指出，帝国主义“内部分崩离析，它脱离人民，它有无法解脱的经济危机”。苏修叛徒集团内外交困
    汪润田（天津解放军支左部队代表）：一九六八年，也是苏修叛徒集团陷入内外交困、走投无路、空前孤立的一年，是现代修正主义总破产的一年，是它们的纸老虎原形大暴露的一年。
    苏修在国内全面复辟资本主义。从一九六六年起，苏修叛徒集团就大规模地推行所谓“新经济体制”。这就是利润挂帅，一切为了赚钱。同时，以苏修叛徒集团为代表的一小撮特权阶层，大大加强了对广大劳动人民的法西斯专政。苏联人民的苦难越来越深重，苏联的贫富日益悬殊，阶级分化日益严重。一小撮特权阶层可以任意解雇工人。据报道，目前苏联一亿一千多万劳动力中，有百分之十二的人失业。
    由于全面复辟资本主义，苏联经济空前混乱，产品质量低劣，市场供应紧张。蔬菜、水果和鲜肉少得可怜，贵得可怕。一公斤西红柿卖两个卢布。一个普通技术员一个月工资只能买三十公斤西红柿。更不用说普通工人了。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流胡吹苏联农业获得“丰收”，胡吹“提高居民福利”等等，这种牛皮早就吹破了。
    王文兴（天津衡器厂工人）：我是中国工人，要狠揭狠批苏修对苏联工人阶级的背叛。赫鲁晓夫和勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流在苏联大搞资本主义复辟，葬送了列宁、斯大林领导苏联人民经过长期斗争所创造的革命成果，使苏联工人兄弟和广大人民受二遍苦，我们感到万分愤慨！
    王风春（天津郊区农民）：我国今年的农业生产又获得了大丰收。天津郊区今年没有下过透雨，但我们农民在毛泽东思想的指引下，战胜了自然灾害，夺得了丰收，水稻产量每亩平均八百斤左右。中国农民丰衣足食，这是因为我们有社会主义制度和无产阶级专政，有毛主席的英明领导，有伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。苏修叛徒集团打着社会主义的旗号，搞的是资本主义。在苏联农村，他们搞什么“包产到组”、物质刺激，甚至土地也可以自由买卖。自由市场到处都有。集体农庄完全变了质，成为地地道道的资本主义经济。由于大搞资本主义复辟，苏联农业遭到了很大的破坏，结果是劳动人民遭了殃。
    边满仓：苏修叛徒集团在国内全面复辟资本主义，对外推行社会帝国主义。今年八月，苏修悍然出动几十万军队侵占捷克斯洛伐克，就是苏修社会帝国主义狰狞面目的一个大暴露。
    苏修不仅出兵捷克斯洛伐克，而且把它的军队开进保加利亚，对保加利亚实行控制；还把舰队开进地中海，进一步威胁社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和巴尔干各国人民的安全。苏修叛徒集团完全是一伙骑在苏联人民和东欧一些国家人民脖子上的新沙皇，是苏联人民和东欧各国人民凶恶的敌人。
    汪润田：苏修侵捷，把它的全部漂亮的外衣和画皮统统剥光了，所以这是苏修的总破产。美帝、苏修相互勾结、妄图重新瓜分世界的阴谋，也彻底地暴露在全世界人民的面前。美帝和苏修这两个世界人民的共同敌人，实际上是互相承认各自的势力范围，大做肮脏透顶的政治交易。
    赵俊修：今年，苏修加紧同美帝勾结，干了一系列出卖世界革命的勾当。它对越南人民的叛卖勾当，在它侵捷事件发生以后，就干得更加起劲了。在越南问题上，苏修和美帝正在加紧勾结，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的烈火。但这是不能得逞的。世界属于人民，胜利属于人民
    王在泉：党的八届十二中全会公报指出：美帝苏修的“赤裸裸的侵略行动，加深了帝国主义集团和修正主义集团的内部矛盾，促进了美帝和苏修国内被压迫人民群众的觉悟，同时正在激起全世界无产阶级和广大人民反对美帝和苏修的新的伟大的斗争高潮。”
    这说得很对。过去的一年，是各国人民的革命斗争取得伟大胜利的一年。一九六九年，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民包括美国人民和苏联人民的革命斗争，将要取得更大的胜利。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“今后的世界必须是人民的世界”。世界属于人民，胜利属于人民。这是一定的，是毫无疑义的。我们中国工人阶级和中国人民一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，一定要把社会主义中国建设得更加强大，一定要大力支援世界各国人民的革命斗争，履行我们无产阶级国际主义的神圣义务。
    边满仓：今年，苏修同美帝加紧共同策划在亚洲拼凑反华包围圈。苏修起劲地同印度、日本、印尼、泰国、“马来西亚”等帝国主义的仆从和走狗相勾结，把矛头指向伟大的社会主义中国。苏修叛徒集团自己还在中苏、中蒙边境集结军队，不断对我国进行军事挑衅。这个事实，恰恰反映了社会主义中国的强大，反映了帝修反的垂死挣扎。我们要严厉警告美帝和苏修，不管你们搜集什么垃圾，拼凑什么样的反华、反革命的“神圣同盟”，到头来只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。假若你们胆敢侵犯我们神圣的国土，那么，用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定不会饶过你们，一定要把侵略者打得粉碎，彻底消灭！
    汪润田：在即将到来的一九六九年，世界革命的形势将会比今年更好。我们社会主义祖国将要变得更加兴盛，更加强大。世界各国人民的革命斗争将要更蓬勃、更广泛、更深入地向前发展。而美帝苏修必将更加孤立，更加困难重重，更加走投无路。
    王风春：瞻望未来，信心百倍。我们面对国内、国际一片大好形势，心情特别激动。我们中国人民，永远无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远坚定地捍卫无产阶级专政，永远支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    全世界无产阶级和革命人民联合起来，彻底打倒帝、修、反，建立光明的新世界！
