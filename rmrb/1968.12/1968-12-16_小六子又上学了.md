Xiaoliuzi, a student from a poor peasant family in Li Jia Village, Li Jia Commune, Zhanhua County, Shandong Province, was recommended to Feng Jia Middle School in July. After just a few months, he stopped attending school and returned home. After the release of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, Xiaoliuzi's family started a study class, and Xiaoliuzi returned to school. From not attending school to returning to school, this change occurred because the poison of Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory was thoroughly criticized, and the idea of "studying for the revolution" was established.

One day, the brigade leader asked Xiaoliuzi why he had stopped going to school. He stammered, "My mother said that now, going to school or not going to school is the same. Even if you graduate from junior high, senior high, or university, you still have to return to the brigade to work. It's better to work late than to work early."

These words reached the ears of Li Xia'an, the head of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association and the person in charge of the school's management by poor and lower-middle peasants. This old man was very uneasy. He thought, "This is the poison of the 'study to become an official' theory." The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was a big deal. He immediately took the communiqué and went to Xiaoliuzi's home. Fortunately, Xiaoliuzi's family had started a study class on the communiqué. Li Xia'an said, "I am here to participate in the family study class."

In the study class, Xiaoliuzi read the communiqué. When he read about expelling the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and calling on the people of the entire country to continue to deeply criticize and expose his counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts, the whole family was excited and said, "Expelling Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever has removed the biggest hidden danger for us poor and lower-middle peasants. The communiqué spoke our hearts."

Then, Xiaoliuzi's mother said, "Our brigade has been criticizing for more than two years. Whatever needs to be criticized has been criticized, and whoever needs to be struggled against has been struggled against. There's nothing left to criticize."

At this time, Li Xia'an stood up and said, "Xiaoliuzi's mother, you are wrong. It's not that there's nothing left to criticize, but that the criticism is endless. Take this matter in front of us, for example: why don't you let Xiaoliuzi go to school?"

Xiaoliuzi's mother said, "In the past, I let the children study so they could find a job. Now, studying, studying, they still have to return to the brigade to work. There's no future in it, so it's better to work at home."

Li Xia'an said, "Xiaoliuzi's mother, you have been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'study to become an official' theory. You say there's no future, but it's just that your personal calculations can't be realized, so you don't let the children go to school. We must not forget our roots! In the past, we poor people didn't even need to go to school. Just listening at the school gate, those bad guys wouldn't allow it. Counting on our fingers, in our Li Jia Village, only the landlords and rich peasants had a middle school student. We poor and lower-middle peasants didn't even have a primary school graduate. Xiaoliuzi is the first batch of poor and lower-middle peasant children sent to middle school by our great leader Chairman Mao. This is the happiness brought to us by Chairman Mao, our savior! We poor and lower-middle peasants must grasp the pen and hold the power firmly, and dig up the root of bitterness."

Li Xia'an's heartfelt words deeply moved Xiaoliuzi's mother. This bitter and deep-hating woman had tears in her eyes and said excitedly, "I have been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi. That future, this future, children who study can read, can fight, can farm, and can wholeheartedly serve us poor and lower-middle peasants, that's the future! Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, he wants our poor and lower-middle peasant children to study and not be on the same side as us poor and lower-middle peasants, not to serve us poor and lower-middle peasants, to become 'people above people.' This is poison to harm us poor and lower-middle peasants. Ten thousand hatreds, hatred for Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, hatred for Liu Shaoqi's black line."

At this time, Xiaoliuzi raised his small fist and shouted, "Down with the black backer of the 'study to become an official' theory, Liu Shaoqi! Thoroughly criticize the 'study to become an official' theory!"

Finally, a family meeting was held to send Xiaoliuzi back to school for the second time. The whole family repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor."

The next day, Xiaoliuzi happily returned to school. Just in time, the school was holding a meeting to criticize Liu Shaoqi's six black theories. Xiaoliuzi made a typical speech criticizing the "study to become an official" theory at the meeting, which had a great impact on the entire school's teachers and students, and promoted the school's revolutionary criticism.

    小六子又上学了
    山东省沾化县李家公社李牙庄小学贫农出身的学生小六子，是今年七月份被推荐到冯家中学的。到学校没几个月他就回家不上了。党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，小六子家里办起了学习班以后，小六子又入学了。从不上学到又入学，是因为在灵魂深处大破了刘少奇的“读书做官论”，树立了“为革命读书”的思想。
    一天，队长问小六子为啥不去上学了？他吞吞吐吐地说：“俺娘说，现在上学和不上学一样，上到初中、高中、大学毕了业，还是跑不了回队劳动。晚劳动不如早劳动。”这些话传到了贫协主任、贫下中农管理学校负责人李希安大爷的耳朵里，这位老人心里很不安，他翻来复去地想：“这就是中了‘读书做官论’的毒。”他越想越觉着这是件大事，马上拿起了公报来到了小六子家里。正好小六子家办起了学习公报的学习班。李大爷开口就说：“我是来参加家庭学习班的。”
    学习班上由小六子读公报。当读到把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并号召全国人民继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清他的反革命修正主义的思想时，全家激动地说：把刘少奇永远开除出党，为咱贫下中农铲除了最大的隐患，公报说出了俺心里话。接着，小六子的母亲又说：“俺这个大队搞了二年多的大批判，该批的批了，该斗的斗了，再批也就是那么些事了，没啥批头了。”这时李希安大爷站起来说：“小六子他娘你错了，不是没啥批，而是批不完。就说眼前的这件事吧：你为啥不让小六子上学了？”小六子的母亲说：“过去让孩子念好了书找个工作。现在念书，念来念去还是得回队劳动，没啥出息，不如在家干活。”李希安大爷说：“小六子他娘啊，你中了刘少奇‘读书做官论’的毒了，你说的没啥出息，还不是私心算盘实现不了，才不让孩子上学了。咱可不能忘本啊！过去咱穷人家不用说上学，就是到学校门口听一听，那些坏蛋也是不让的。掐着手指头数吧，咱李牙庄除了地富分子家有一个中学生，咱贫下中农连个高小学生也没有。小六子可是我们伟大领袖毛主席送咱李牙庄贫下中农子女头一批入中学的，这是救命恩人毛主席给咱带来的幸福啊！咱贫下中农不去掌握笔杆子，印把子就握不牢，苦根子也挖不掉。”李希安大爷这语重心长的一席话，深深打动了小六子的母亲。这位苦大仇深的大娘眼含着泪花，激动地说：“我中了刘少奇的毒了，这出息，那出息，孩子念了书，能文能武能种地，能全心全意为俺贫下中农办事就是出息！刘少奇这个大坏蛋，他狼子野心想让俺贫下中农孩子念了书不和咱贫下中农一条心，不为咱贫下中农服务，做‘人上人’，这是毒害咱贫下中农的毒药。千恨万恨恨刘少奇这个大坏蛋，恨刘少奇的黑路线。”这时，小六子举起小拳头高呼：“打倒‘读书做官论’的黑后台刘少奇！”“彻底批判‘读书做官论’！”
    最后，又开了欢送小六子第二次入学的家庭会。全家反复学习了毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导。
    第二天，小六子高高兴兴地回到了学校，正好学校开批判刘少奇黑“六论”的大会，小六子在会上作了批判“读书做官论”的典型发言，对全校师生都有很大的启发，推动了全校的革命大批判。
