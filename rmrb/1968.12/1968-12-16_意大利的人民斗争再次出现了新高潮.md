The revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America are surging forward in waves. The people of the United States and many Western European countries continue to fight against the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. Especially since the beginning of December, the people's struggle in Italy has reached a new high.

On December 2, the reactionary military police in Sicily brutally suppressed striking workers, resulting in a massacre where two workers were killed and over fifty were injured. The reactionaries' suppression has sparked great indignation and strong protests from the people of all Italy. Within a few days, from Sicily to the Apennine Peninsula, from the capital Rome to various major cities, workers went on strike, students boycotted classes, and demonstrations and protests occurred continuously, sweeping across the entire country. The demonstrators chanted slogans such as "Workers and students unite!" "Down with the Fascist police!" "Workers want power!" They waved red flags, sang the "Internationale," held up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, and marched forward bravely. The demonstrators in various places fought bravely against the reactionary police. This new storm has powerfully demonstrated the unprecedented awakening and great strength of the Italian working class and revolutionary masses.

In this struggle, the fighting actions of workers and students supported and inspired each other, forming a united front. To oppose the brutal exploitation of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, 1.5 million workers in Rome and its surrounding areas went on a general strike, paralyzing the heart of Italy. Students in many places occupied schools and put forward action programs to oppose the decadent bourgeois education system. The united struggle of workers and students has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule in Italy. Italian President Saragat anxiously said, "Italy is experiencing a turbulent period."

The Italian reactionaries foolishly attempted to suppress the people's struggle with force. However, the result can only serve to mobilize the Italian people to further develop their struggle against the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All the persecutions inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only serve to accelerate the people's more extensive and more violent revolution." The struggle of the Italian people has already proven and will continue to prove this brilliant thesis.

    意大利的人民斗争再次出现了新高潮
    欧洲、北美的革命群众运动，正在一浪接一浪奔腾向前。美国和许多西欧国家的人民，继续展开反对垄断资产阶级反动统治的斗争。特别是从十二月初开始，意大利的人民斗争又出现了新高潮。
    十二月二日，意大利西西里岛的反动军警血腥镇压罢工工人，造成打死两名工人、打伤五十多名工人的大血案。反动派的镇压，激起了全意大利人民的极大愤慨和强烈抗议。几天之内，从西西里岛到阿平宁半岛，从首都罗马到各大城市，工人罢工，学生罢课，游行示威不断发生，一场来势迅猛的斗争风暴席卷整个意大利。示威群众高呼“工人学生团结起来！”
  “打倒法西斯警察！”“工人要权力！”等战斗口号，挥舞红旗，高唱《国际歌》，高举伟大导师毛主席的画像，奋勇前进。各地的示威群众同反动警察进行了英勇的搏斗。这一场新的风暴，有力地显示了意大利工人阶级和广大革命群众的空前觉醒和伟大力量。
    在这场斗争中，工人和学生的战斗行动互相支持，互相鼓舞，联成一气。为了反对垄断资产阶级的残酷剥削，罗马及附近地区的一百五十万工人举行了总罢工，使意大利的这个心脏地区陷于瘫痪状态。不少地方的学生纷纷占领学校，提出了反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的行动纲领。工人学生的团结战斗，沉重地打击了意大利的反动统治。意大利总统萨拉盖特忧心忡忡地说：“意大利正经历着一个动乱的时期”。
    意大利反动派妄想用武力镇压来扑灭人民斗争的熊熊烈火。但是，其结果只能起到动员意大利人民更深入地开展反对垄断资产阶级统治的作用。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”意大利人民的斗争进程，已经证明了而且必将继续证明这一光辉的论断。
