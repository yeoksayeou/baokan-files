The progressive student movement in the United States continues to develop. Students at San Francisco City College demonstrated in protest against suppression, and students at the University of Washington held a rally to oppose military training.

BEIJING, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) — WASHINGTON — More than 3,000 students at San Francisco State College, who have been on strike for over a month to protest racial discrimination and the reactionary and corrupt educational system, held a massive demonstration in the heart of San Francisco on Dec. 7. They protested against the brutal suppression and deceitful schemes of the college authorities and expressed their determination to continue the struggle.

The students carried placards and shouted slogans of protest, marching to the steps of City Hall where they held a protest rally. Speakers at the rally were indignant and unanimously condemned the savage suppression of students by the reactionary city authorities and the college administration. Then, the demonstrators marched to the offices of two San Francisco newspapers to protest against their distorted reporting of the student struggle.

In St. Louis, Missouri, students at Washington University launched a struggle against military training courses. On the night of Dec. 6, students of the College of Liberal Arts, with the support of many faculty members, held a heated meeting to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression policies and demanded the cancellation of military courses for training reserve officers for the U.S. Army. Under the strong pressure of the student struggle, the reactionary school authorities were forced to agree to cancel the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps program.

In addition, nearly 40 black students at the university continued to occupy an office, protesting against the beating of a black student by reactionary police and the discriminatory measures against black students by the school administration.

    旧金山学院学生示威抗议镇压　华盛顿大学学生集会反对军训
    新华社八日讯　华盛顿消息：为了抗议种族歧视和反动腐朽的教育制度而坚持罢课斗争一个多月的美国加利福尼亚州州立旧金山学院学生三千多人，七日在旧金山市中心举行声势浩大的示威，抗议学院当局的暴力镇压和欺骗阴谋，并且表示他们要继续进行斗争的决心。
    学生们举着标语牌，高呼抗议口号，游行到市政厅前面举行了抗议大会。在会上发言的人义愤填膺，一致谴责反动市政当局和旧金山学院院方野蛮镇压学生的罪行。然后，示威队伍又到旧金山市的两家报社去示威，抗议它们歪曲报道学生斗争的真实情况。
    在密苏里州圣路易斯城的华盛顿大学，又爆发了学生反对军训课程的斗争。这所大学文理学院的学生六日夜晚在许多教职员的支持下，举行了一次群情激昂的反对美帝国主义侵略政策的会议，要求取消为美国军队训练预备役军官的军事课程。在学生斗争的强大压力下，反动学校当局被迫答应取消陆军预备军官训练计划。
    此外，这所大学的将近四十名黑人学生，继续占领着大学的一间办公室，抗议反动警察殴打一名黑人学生以及校方歧视黑人学生的反动措施。
