Through study and the deepening of revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses have further ignited their boundless love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and their profound hatred for Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, effectively promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation across all fronts.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing on the 2nd, the broad revolutionary masses of Jiangsu Province are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be frequently and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." They are currently launching a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, further arming themselves with Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and principles regarding the continuation of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are more consciously implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, effectively promoting the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation across all fronts.

The broad revolutionary masses have studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and the reissued report from the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee. They have deeply realized that the history of our party is the history of the struggle between the two lines, the history of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line defeating the bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian revolutionary line, represented by Mao Zedong, represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring masses. It is the line that guides the revolutionary masses from victory to victory, the line to establish and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent capitalist restoration, and build socialism. The bourgeois reactionary line, represented by Liu Shaoqi, represents the interests of imperialism, revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and all exploiting classes. It is the line to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. They say, "Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, Mao Zedong's views on class and class struggle, and his views on the continuation of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must discuss them every day, every month, every year. Let it deeply take root among the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses."

The broad revolutionary masses link the actual struggle between the two lines in their region and unit, deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. They unanimously agree that the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Jiangsu Province is extremely sharp and complex. Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, have at every critical moment and on every major issue, frantically opposed and sabotaged Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. During the Anti-Japanese War, Liu Shaoqi, stationed in Su North, engaged in surrender and collusion, formed factions, and extensively promoted the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory." He revised the infamous "Self-Cultivation" in Jiangsu, concocted the poisonous works "On Party Struggles," and implemented a whole set of capitulationist lines and revisionist party-building lines. After liberation, Liu Shaoqi visited Jiangsu six times, spreading a large amount of poison in Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Xuzhou, Lianyungang, Nantong, Yangzhou, Huaiyin, Changshu, Gaoyou, Hongze, Shuyang, and other places. Liu Shaoqi also planted a group of trusted followers in Jiangsu, attempting to turn Jiangsu into one of their bases for restoring capitalism. In the "February Countercurrent" of 1967, class enemies intervened to sabotage the Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu Province, attempting to rehabilitate Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Jiangsu. The broad revolutionary masses, recalling the history of the struggle between the two lines, have further ignited their boundless love for Mao Zedong's revolutionary line and their profound hatred for Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Learn war from war—this is our main method." The broad revolutionary masses in various places learn the history of the struggle between the two lines through their practice in the struggle between the two lines. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of thoroughly defeating the enemy, further deepen the revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism. In the places where the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi has been, the revolutionary masses, with what they have seen and heard, fiercely expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes. The people of Yancheng Prefecture set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere, frequently holding denunciation meetings, exposure meetings, accusation meetings, and family criticism meetings, denouncing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes in the Yanfu area. Liu Shaoqi once stayed in the north building of Yancheng Middle School to revise the infamous "Self-Cultivation." The workers, the PLA propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, and the revolutionary teachers and students of the school, with great indignation, named the north building the "Anti-Revisionism Building" and held a denunciation meeting of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi in front of the building. Liu Shaoqi once poisoned the old county committee meeting room in Shuyang County. The Revolutionary Committee and the Workers' Congress held a criticism meeting in this meeting room to eliminate the poison. Liu Shaoqi slandered the people's commune in Nantong. The revolutionary people of Nantong Prefecture listed a large number of facts, highly praised the superiority of the people's commune, and strongly denounced Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies against the people's commune.

The broad revolutionary masses of Jiangsu Province have studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, and further understood Chairman Mao's teachings: "This proletarian cultural revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." The more they study, the more they feel that Chairman Mao's directives are extremely brilliant, and the more they study, the more they feel that this proletarian cultural revolution must be carried out, and it cannot be delayed.

    联系本地区本单位的阶级斗争实际
    江苏掀起两条路线斗争史学习运动
    通过学习和深入开展革命大批判，更加激发了广大革命群众对毛主席革命路线的无限热爱，对刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的无比仇恨，有力地推动了各条战线的斗批改
    据新华社南京二日电  江苏省广大革命群众坚决贯彻毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，正在掀起一个两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策武装自己，更加自觉地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，有力地推动了各条战线斗、批、改的深入发展。
    广大革命群众学习了毛主席的最新指示和重新发表的毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，深刻地认识到，我们党的历史，就是两条路线的斗争史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的历史。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线代表着无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，是引导革命群众从胜利走向胜利的路线，是建立和巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义的路线；以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，代表着帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派和一切剥削阶级的利益，是颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的路线。他们说，毛主席的革命路线，毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点、关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的观点，我们就是要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲。让它在亿万革命群众中深深扎根。
    广大革命群众联系本地区、本单位两条路线斗争的实际，深入学习两条路线斗争史。大家一致认为，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争在江苏省是十分尖锐、复杂的。刘少奇及其在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光之流，在每一个重要时刻，每一个重大问题上，都疯狂地反对和破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。抗日战争时期，刘少奇盘踞在苏北，招降纳叛，结党营私，大搞“陕北有个延安，苏北有个盐城”的反动的资产阶级的
  “多中心论”。他在江苏修改过臭名昭著的黑《修养》，炮制了《论党内斗争》等大毒草，推行了一整套投降主义路线和修正主义建党路线。解放后，刘少奇先后六次到江苏活动，在南京、无锡、苏州、徐州、连云港、南通、扬州、淮阴、常熟、高邮、洪泽、沭阳等地散布了大量毒素。刘少奇还在江苏安插了一批亲信，妄图把江苏变成他们复辟资本主义的基地之一。在一九六七年的那股“二月逆流”中，阶级敌人又插手破坏江苏省的无产阶级文化大革命，为刘少奇及其在江苏的代理人翻案。广大革命群众回顾两条路线斗争的历史，更加激发了对毛主席革命路线的无限热爱，对刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的无比仇恨。
    毛主席教导我们：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”各地广大革命群众在两条路线斗争的实践中，学习两条路线斗争历史。他们以毛泽东思想为强大思想武器，发扬痛打落水狗的革命精神，进一步深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇所散布的反革命修正主义流毒。在叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇到过的地方，革命群众以亲眼所见、亲耳所闻的事实，狠揭猛批刘少奇的反革命罪行。盐城专区人民到处摆下革命大批判的战场，不断召开声讨会、揭发会、控诉会、家庭批判会，声讨刘少奇在盐阜地区所犯下的滔天罪行。刘少奇曾经住在盐城中学的北楼上修改过黑《修养》。驻这个中学的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和学校革命师生怀着极大的愤怒，把北楼定名为“反修楼”，并在楼前召开了声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇大会。刘少奇曾经在沭阳县旧县委会议室放过毒，县革委会和工代会就在这个会议室举行批判大会肃清流毒。刘少奇在南通污蔑人民公社，南通专区的革命人民，列举大量事实，大颂人民公社的优越性，痛斥刘少奇反对人民公社的反动谬论。
    江苏省广大革命群众学习了两条路线斗争史，深入开展革命大批判，更加深刻领会了毛主席的教导：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”他们越学越感到毛主席的指示无比英明，越学越觉得这次无产阶级文化大革命非搞不可，不搞不得了。
