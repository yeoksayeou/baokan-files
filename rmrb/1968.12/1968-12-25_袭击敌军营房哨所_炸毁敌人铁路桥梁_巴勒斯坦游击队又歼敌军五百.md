Palestinian guerrillas attack enemy military camps and outposts, destroy enemy railways and bridges

According to a report from the "Fatah" (Palestine National Liberation Movement) and other Palestinian nationalist organizations in Damascus on the 23rd, Palestinian guerrillas launched 56 attacks against Israeli aggressor troops in the ten days of mid-December, killing and wounding approximately 500 Israeli soldiers.

During this period, the "Storm" units and other Palestinian guerrillas were very active in the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and regions under Israeli control. They attacked six Israeli military camps and one police station, destroyed one Israeli forward outpost, five observation posts, and ten barracks. They also destroyed three tanks, one armored vehicle, three mine-clearing vehicles, seventeen half-track vehicles, and other military vehicles totaling forty units. They also blew up a section of railway near Gaza City, destroying two bridges, including one on the public road connecting the Israeli port of Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea.

On the night of the 19th, the "Storm" units launched a surprise attack on an Israeli patrol between Jericho and Jerusalem at Wadi Qalt. The entire patrol was annihilated. The assault team then broke through and returned to their base.

During this period, Palestinian workers and youth in the West Bank of the Jordan River also fought against Israeli occupation.

    据新华社大马士革二十三日电　据“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）和其他巴勒斯坦民族主义组织在这里发表的战报，巴勒斯坦游击队在十二月中旬的十天内向以色列侵略军出击了五十六次，打死打伤以色列官兵约五百名。
    在这期间，“暴风”部队和巴勒斯坦其他游击队在约旦河西岸、加沙地带、戈兰高地和以色列统治的地区都很活跃。他们袭击了以色列的六个兵营和一个警察局，破坏了以色列的一个前沿哨所、五个观察哨和十座营房，总共击毁了三辆坦克、一辆装甲车、三辆扫雷车、十七辆半履带车以及其他军用车辆四十部。他们还炸毁了加沙市附近的一段铁路，炸毁了两座桥梁，其中有一座是在连接亚喀巴湾以色列的埃拉特港口和死海的公路上的桥。
    十九日晚上，“暴风”部队在杰里科和耶路撒冷之间的瓦迪卡勒特对以色列的一支巡逻队发动突然袭击，全歼这支巡逻队。突击队然后突围返回基地。
    在这期间，约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦工人和青年也进行了斗争，反对以色列占领。
