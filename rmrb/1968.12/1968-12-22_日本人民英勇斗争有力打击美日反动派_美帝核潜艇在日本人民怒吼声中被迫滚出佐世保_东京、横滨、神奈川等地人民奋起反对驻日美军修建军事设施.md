The Japanese people's brave struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The U.S. imperialist nuclear submarine was forced out of Sasebo amid the roars of the Japanese people. People in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kanagawa, and other places have risen up to oppose the construction of military facilities by the U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

Chairman Mao said: "The people of the world should unite more closely and launch sustained and powerful attacks on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its lackeys!"

New China News Agency, December 21st: According to the Oriental News Agency, the U.S. nuclear submarine "Triton" that intruded into Sasebo Port on the 18th, slipped out of Sasebo Port on the morning of the 21st amid the strong protests and roars of the workers, students, and citizens of Sasebo and the surrounding areas.

On the morning of the 21st, workers from Nagasaki Prefecture and the Sasebo area held a demonstration march around the U.S. military base in Sasebo, shouting anti-U.S. slogans. They then held a protest rally at the Sasebo Port wharf. A worker representative at the rally exposed the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to strengthen the U.S. military bases in Japan, including Sasebo, and to arm Japan with nuclear weapons. He also expressed the determination to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to carry the anti-U.S. struggle to the end.

Since the U.S. "Triton" intruded into Sasebo Port, workers, students, and citizens in Japan have continuously held large-scale anti-U.S. demonstrations. The pro-U.S. Sato reactionary government sent a large number of armed police to suppress the workers, students, and citizens. The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group, led by Kyuichi Tokuda, closely collaborated with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, slandering the brave workers, students, and citizens, fully exposing its role as a lackey of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. However, the workers, students, and citizens of Japan, undeterred by the reactionaries' suppression, bravely continued their struggle, dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and once again foiled the conspiracy of the Tokuda group.

According to the New China News Agency, December 19th: According to the Oriental News Agency, the Japanese people have recently launched struggles in many places to oppose the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the construction of military facilities by the U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

On the 18th, students of Tokyo Geidai University held an anti-U.S. rally. After the rally, they marched to the U.S. military command in Japan and the location of the U.S. Fifth Air Force in Fuchu to hold a demonstration. The U.S. military authorities hurriedly dispatched helicopters to threaten the demonstrating students, and the Sato reactionary government also sent a large number of police to suppress them. However, the students bravely persisted in their demonstration, showing the determination of the Japanese people to drive the U.S. imperialists out of Japan.

Recently, farmers in Seta Town, Yokohama City, have launched a struggle to protest the enormous losses caused to them by the U.S. military's Seta communication base. This communication and intelligence base is an important base for the U.S. military in the Far East. It has seized approximately 2.3 million square meters of Japanese farmers' land, causing serious losses to the local farmers. The 49 farming households in Seta Town recently notified the Sato government that they decided to abolish the so-called "contract" for the U.S. military's seizure of land and determined to reclaim their own land.

Recently, farmers and fishermen in Saiki Town, Kanagawa Ward, Yokohama City, have also launched a struggle, demanding the removal of the U.S. military fuel depot located in this area. This depot is built on 520,000 square meters of land. The U.S. military authorities unreasonably restrict the fishing operations of local fishermen, and the fuel often spilled from the fuel storage depot into the sea causes serious damage to fishing operations and the cultivation of laver. Moreover, the U.S. military authorities also demand the requisition of more farmland. The residents of Saiki Town rejected the U.S. military's demand and have been conducting a resolute struggle.

Citizens of Sagamihara City, Kanagawa Prefecture, are opposing the U.S. military's plan to rebuild a railway siding. The purpose of the U.S. military authorities in rebuilding this railway siding is to connect the U.S. military's Sagamihara Comprehensive Supply Depot located in this city with the "national" railway Yokohama Line's Funaoedai Station, to expedite the transportation of U.S. military supplies, and to serve its further strategy of expanding its counter-revolutionary war of aggression in Asia.

The U.S. military authorities' plan immediately encountered strong opposition from local residents. Citizens living near the railway siding construction site have already taken action.

According to the New China News Agency, December 21st: According to the Oriental News Agency, the struggle of Japanese students against the rule of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the decadent bourgeois education system is thriving.

Recently, progressive students at Sophia University in Tokyo went on strike and occupied school buildings, including the main office, demanding that the school authorities cancel the unreasonable decision to expel students who participated in the struggle against the expansion of the Tachikawa U.S. military base and demanding that students have the freedom to engage in political activities. On the 21st, the reactionary university authorities, in collusion with the Sato government, sent 700 armed police to brutally suppress the students in an attempt to drive them out of the school buildings. However, the students, undaunted by the violence, bravely defended themselves with stones and glass bottles. In a one-hour fierce struggle, the fascist police unlawfully arrested 52 students. The police's suppression of progressive students aroused great indignation among a wide range of students. Two thousand students rushed to the school upon hearing the news and held a protest rally on the school's playground, strongly condemning the crimes of the Sato government and the university authorities. Students from Tokyo University and Meiji Gakuin, who were also on strike, participated in the rally and encouraged their fellow students at Sophia University to unite closely and continue the struggle. The protest rally lasted for more than five hours in a fighting atmosphere.

Recently, progressive students at Osaka University also occupied and blockaded the student affairs building, protesting the unreasonable punishment of students by the university authorities. The students thwarted the disruptive activities of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda and have been on strike since mid-October.

On December 19th, more than ten thousand patriotic workers and students in Sasebo City held a grand anti-U.S. rally and demonstration, strongly protesting the intrusion of the U.S. imperialist nuclear submarine "Triton" into Sasebo Port. The demonstrators held up portraits of Chairman Mao and anti-U.S. placards, shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "U.S. nuclear submarines, get out!"

    东京、横滨、神奈川等地人民奋起反对驻日美军修建军事设施
    毛主席说：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”
    新华社二十一日讯  据东方通讯社报道：十八日闯入佐世保港的美国核潜艇“潜水者号”，在日本工人、学生和市民的强大抗议的怒吼声中，于二十一日上午溜出佐世保港。
    二十一日上午，长崎县和佐世保地区的工人又在美军佐世保基地周围示威游行，愤怒地高呼反美口号，然后在佐世保港码头举行抗议集会。工人代表在集会上揭露了美日反动派准备加强包括佐世保在内的驻日美军基地和用核武器武装日本的阴谋，并且表示决心粉碎日美“安全条约”，一定要把反美斗争进行到底。
    自从美国“潜水者号”闯入佐世保港以来，日本工人、学生和市民不断地举行规模巨大的反美示威游行。亲美的佐藤反动政府派出大批武装警察镇压工人、学生和市民。日共宫本修正主义集团密切配合美日反动派，对英勇斗争的工人、学生和市民进行诬蔑，充分暴露了它充当美日反动派的走狗的面目。但是，日本工人、学生和市民不顾反动派的镇压，英勇地坚持斗争，有力地打击了美日反动派，并且又一次地挫败了宫本集团的阴谋。
    据新华社十九日讯据东方通讯社报道：日本人民最近在许多地方展开斗争，反对日美“安全条约”和驻日美军修建军事设施。
    东京学艺大学的学生十八日举行反美集会，会后前往驻日美军司令部和美国第五航空队的所在地府中举行示威游行。美军当局慌忙派直升飞机升空恫吓示威学生，佐藤反动政府也派大批警察前往镇压。但是，学生们勇敢地坚持示威游行，表现了日本人民一定要把美帝赶出日本的决心。
    横滨市濑谷镇农民最近展开斗争，抗议美军上濑谷电讯基地给农民造成的巨大损失。这个电讯基地是美军在远东地区的重要通讯和情报活动基地。它霸占了日本农民土地大约二百三十万平方米，给当地农民造成严重损失。濑谷镇的四十九户农民最近通知佐藤政府，他们决定废除美军霸占土地的所谓“合同”，决心要夺回自己的土地。
    横滨市金泽区柴镇的农民和渔民最近也展开斗争，要求撤除位于这个地区的美国军用燃料仓库。这个仓库建筑在五十二万平方米的地面上。美军当局无理限制当地渔民的捕鱼作业，而且从燃料储存仓库倾注到海中的燃料往往给捕鱼作业和培植紫菜造成严重损害。不仅如此，美军当局还要求征用更多的农田。柴镇的居民拒绝了美军的要求，他们一直进行着坚决的斗争。
    神奈川县相模原市的市民正在反对美军重建铁路侧线的计划。美军当局重建这条铁路侧线的目的是要把位于这个城市的美军相模原综合补给仓库同“国营”铁道横滨线的渊野边车站连结起来，以加紧进行美国军用物资的运输，为其进一步扩大侵略亚洲的反革命战略服务。
    美军当局的这一计划，立即遭到当地居民的强烈反对。住在铁路侧线工地附近的市民已经行动起来。
    据新华社二十一日讯  据东方通讯社报道：日本大学生反对美日反动派统治和腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的斗争，正在蓬勃发展。
    东京上智大学的进步学生最近举行罢课并占领包括校本部办公室在内的学校建筑物，要求学校当局取消关于开除参加反对扩建立川美军基地斗争的学生的无理决定，并要求学生享有政治活动的自由。反动的大学当局在二十一日勾结佐藤政府，出动七百名武装警察野蛮地镇压学生，妄图把学生赶出校楼。但是，学生们不畏强暴，英勇地用石块和玻璃瓶进行自卫。在一小时的激烈斗争中，法西斯警察无理逮捕了五十二名学生。警察镇压进步学生的暴行激起了广大学生的极大愤慨。两千名学生闻讯赶到学校，在学校的操场上举行抗议集会，强烈谴责佐藤政府和大学当局的罪行。正在举行罢课斗争的东京大学和明治学院的学生也参加了集会，并鼓励上智大学的同学要紧密团结，坚持斗争。抗议集会在战斗的气氛中持续了五个多小时。
    大阪大学的进步学生最近也占领和封锁了学生部大楼，抗议大学当局对学生的无理惩罚。学生们挫败了日共宫本修正主义集团的破坏活动，从十月中旬以来一直坚持罢课。（附图片）
    十二月十九日，日本爱国工人和学生一万多人在佐世保市举行声势浩大的反美集会和示威，强烈抗议美帝核潜艇“潜水者号”闯入佐世保港。示威者高举毛主席像和反美标语牌，高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“美国核潜艇滚出去！”
