	Live and Learn Until Old Age, Work Until Old Age
	By Su Fengtian, an active learner and user of Mao Zedong Thought from the Faku County, a poor old peasant from the Wuniushi Brigade of the Wuniushi People's Commune

	I am a member of the Wuniushi Brigade of the Wuniushi People's Commune in Faku County, Liaoning Province. I am seventy-six years old. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers helped us set up a Mao Zedong Thought school in our brigade. At first, I worried that I was too old, illiterate, and had a poor memory. Could I learn? Later, in the Mao Zedong Thought school, I joined everyone in recalling past bitterness and present sweetness, praising the great achievements of our great leader Chairman Mao; we carried out revolutionary criticism and severely criticized the heinous crimes of the traitor and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. My thoughts began to change. Thinking about the past bitterness and looking at today's sweetness, I felt that not studying Chairman Mao's works was ungrateful and disloyal to Chairman Mao.

	In the past, my son and daughter-in-law advised me, "You are so old, we can support you with our labor. You don't need to work anymore." I also thought that at nearly eighty years old, with so many grandchildren, I should sit on the kang and enjoy my old age. After studying the "Three Articles," my mind became much clearer, and I understood the meaning of serving the people wholeheartedly. Chairman Mao is over seventy years old and still works day and night for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. How can I enjoy a comfortable life at home? Although I am old, my body is still healthy. I can't do heavy work, but I can do light work! With this in mind, I decided to follow Chairman Mao's words and live, learn, and work until old age.

	Last year during the harvest, our brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants criticized the traitor and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's black goods of "work points as the commander" and "material incentives." We implemented the Dazhai-style work points system. However, a rich peasant element spread rumors in secret, saying, "Points, points, the root of life," "Contract work is fast, daily work is slow, fewer points, no work." I heard this and was so angry that I almost burst with rage. At the criticism meeting, I and the poor and lower-middle peasants severely criticized the traitor and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and the evil person's spread of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. That evil person was criticized to the point of deflation, like a punctured pig's bladder. The next day, I took my sickle and went to the fields with the community members to harvest the crops. My waist ached, but I didn't mind. Looking at the Mao Zedong badge on my chest, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and my body was filled with boundless strength.

	I often think that the happy homeland that Chairman Mao has given us poor and lower-middle peasants, we must protect it generation after generation. The children were born in a fortunate nest and do not know the bitterness of the past. We, the older generation, must constantly give them class education, or they will forget their roots, and forgetting their roots will make them become "spoiled children." Whenever I have free time, I tell the children in my family and the young people in the brigade about the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, so that they always remember the bitterness of their class and pass on the revolutionary baton. My eldest son used to work in the brigade, and if something went wrong, he would quit and sometimes argue with the brigade leader. To prevent him from going downhill, I said in a family study session, "In the old society, the poor and lower-middle peasants suffered because they had no power. Now, Chairman Mao leads us to rise up, have power, and live a good life. If we don't work hard, it is ungrateful and disloyal to Chairman Mao. Your younger brother is a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, using his gun to defend the proletarian homeland on the front line. We must also learn from the PLA in the rear, produce more grain, support the socialist revolution, and ensure that the proletarian red political power remains unchanged for thousands of years." After hearing my words, my eldest son checked his past mistakes of not working hard and said he would definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and work hard for the revolution in the future. Now he actively studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought and takes the initiative to do heavy work. Everyone says he has made great progress compared to before.

    活到老　学到老　干到老
    法库县活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、卧牛石公社卧牛石大队老贫农  苏风田
    我是辽宁省法库县卧牛石公社卧牛石大队的社员，今年七十六岁了。在无产阶级文化大革命中，解放军同志帮助我们大队办起了毛泽东思想大学校。刚学习时，我担心自己年岁大了，一个大字不识，记性又不好，能学得了吗？后来，在毛泽东思想大学校里，我跟大伙一起忆苦思甜，颂扬我们伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩；开展革命大批判，狠批大叛徒刘少奇的滔天罪行，思想才转了个弯。想想过去的苦，看看今日的甜，觉得不学习毛主席著作就是忘本，就是不忠于毛主席。
    从前，我儿子和儿媳妇劝我说：“您老这么大年岁了，有我们劳动养活您，就别再去做活了。”我也寻思自己快八十岁的人了，儿孙一大帮，该坐在炕上养养老了。学习了“老三篇”，心里可亮堂多了，懂得了完全彻底为人民服务的道理。毛主席他老人家都七十多岁了，还为中国革命和世界革命日夜操劳，我怎么能在家坐享清福呢？虽说年纪大了，可我的身体还很好，干不了重活，也能干轻活呀！想到这里，我决心听毛主席的话，活到老，学到老，干到老。
    去年收割的时候，我们队的贫下中农批判了大叛徒刘少奇散布的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货，实行了大寨式的评工记分。可是有个富农分子却在背地里煽阴风，点邪火。胡说什么“分，分，小命根”“包工快，日工磨，少给分，不干活。”我一听，简直气炸了肺。在批判会上，我和贫下中农狠狠地批判了大叛徒刘少奇和这个坏家伙所散布的反革命修正主义谬论。那个坏家伙被批得象撒了气的猪尿泡，熊了。第二天，我就拿着镰刀跟社员们下地割庄稼，腰累酸了，我也不在乎。看看胸前戴的毛主席像章，想起毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，浑身就增添了无穷的力量。
    我常想，毛主席给咱贫下中农打的幸福江山，咱要辈辈保，代代保。孩子们生在福窝里，不知过去的苦滋味，咱老一辈的要不经常对他们进行阶级教育，他们就会忘本，忘了本就会变成“败家子”。我一有空就给家里的孩子、队里的青年们讲旧社会的苦，说新社会的甜，让他们时刻不忘阶级苦，接好革命班。我大儿子过去在队里干活，一不顺心就甩手不干了，有时还跟队长顶起嘴来。为了不让他走下坡路，我在一次家庭学习班上，我说，在旧社会，贫下中农苦就苦在没有权上了。如今毛主席领导咱翻了身，有了权，过上了好日子。咱不好好干，就是忘本，就是不忠于毛主席。你弟弟是中国人民解放军，在前方用枪杆子保卫无产阶级江山。咱在后方也要向解放军学习，多打粮食，支援社会主义革命，让无产阶级红色政权千秋万代永不变色。大儿子听了我这一席话后，检查了他过去不好好劳动的错误，表示今后一定听毛主席的话，好好干革命。现在他努力活学活用毛泽东思想，主动拣重活干。大伙都说他比过去进步多了。
