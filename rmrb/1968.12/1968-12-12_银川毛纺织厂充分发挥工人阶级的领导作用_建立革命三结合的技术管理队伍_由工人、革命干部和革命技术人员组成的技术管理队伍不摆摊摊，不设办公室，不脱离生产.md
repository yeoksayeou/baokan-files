The revolutionary workers of the Yinchuan Woolen Textile Mill in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts. They have thoroughly criticized and repudiated the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that renegade, hidden traitor, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi promoted in industrial and mining enterprises. They have completely reformed the old technical management system and established a revolutionary three-in-one technical management team that does not leave production. This team is in charge of the technical affairs of the entire mill.

This mill's revolutionary three-in-one technical management team is called the Red Expert Brigade. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the mill, this brigade is composed mainly of workers, combined with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel. Currently, there are 46 members in the brigade, 37 of whom are workers. Most of these workers are old workers with rich practical experience. The six technical personnel in the Red Expert Brigade are those who have good relations with the workers and are selected by the workers from the 33 technical personnel in the entire mill. The brigade leader is an old worker, the deputy leader is a cadre of worker origin, and the political instructor is the head of the revolutionary committee of the mill. The Red Expert Brigade sets up Red Expert Groups in each workshop, with the group members being the brigade members and the group leaders mostly being the workshop directors. This Red Expert Brigade, which manages the technical work of the entire mill, does not set up stalls, does not have an office, and except for the political instructor, all members do not leave their production posts. After a period of practice, the workers believe that this three-in-one technical management organization has the following advantages:

First, it can ensure the firm implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and better highlight proletarian politics. Workers have the deepest understanding and most firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They hate the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "expert management," "technology first," and "material incentives" promoted by the renegade, hidden traitor, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi the most. The working class has taken control of the technical leadership, completely changing the situation where the old technical team was detached from proletarian politics. The workers say: "Our Red Expert Brigade is to use proletarian politics to lead technology and let Mao Zedong Thought firmly occupy the technological front!"

Second, it completely cuts off the redundant institutions and completely changes the situation where engineering and technical personnel are detached from productive labor. The original technical management system has been completely reformed, and the original technical management departments have been completely abolished. The Red Expert Brigade is directly under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the mill. All members of the Red Expert Brigade are fighting on the production front line. When there are problems, they discuss and solve them by the machine.

Third, it is beneficial to launch a mass movement. The Red Expert Brigade is organized with workers as the leaders and the main body, with a solid mass foundation, and is strongly supported and welcomed by the masses. Now, the Red Expert Brigade mobilizes the masses extensively, breaks superstitions, designs and trials itself, and participates from beginning to end. Such a lively mass movement scene is in sharp contrast to the past when only a few "experts" were relied upon, creating a cold and desolate atmosphere.

Because the Red Expert Brigade firmly implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and launches a mass movement in technological innovation, the flowers of technological innovation are blooming all over the mill. Since the establishment of the brigade more than a month ago, the mill has proposed 23 major innovation projects, nine of which have been successfully reformed. Among them, the successful trial production of industrial felt has created a new process for producing this industrial felt in our country. These facts powerfully prove that Chairman Mao's pointing out that "the masses are the real heroes" and "the lowly are the wisest, the noble are the most foolish" is an unbreakable great truth.

Fourth, it is beneficial to build a proletarian technical team. Many workers with practical experience have participated in the revolutionary three-in-one technical management organization. They have shifted from managing a single machine, a single process, and a single type of labor to managing the technical affairs of a workshop or even the entire mill. Their organizational abilities have greatly improved, and their inventive wisdom has been fully exploited. A proletarian technical team that does not leave production is rapidly growing. On the other hand, it has strengthened the re-education of technical personnel trained in old schools. After the establishment of the Red Expert Brigade, the original 33 technical personnel who were in charge of technical management work were all sent down to the teams and studied and worked shifts with the workers. This will have a great impact on changing their world outlook and making them better serve proletarian politics. The six technical personnel who participated in the Red Expert Brigade deeply felt that in the past, workers called us "teachers," and we were content with it. Now, after participating in production practice, we realize that workers are our best teachers. Technical personnel trained in old schools can only firmly accept the leadership of the working class, accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be willing to be their students, in order to contribute their strength to socialist construction.

    银川毛纺织厂充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用
    建立革命三结合的技术管理队伍
    由工人、革命干部和革命技术人员组成的技术管理队伍不摆摊摊，不设办公室，不脱离生产
    据新华社银川十一日电　宁夏回族自治区银川毛纺织厂革命工人活学活用毛泽东思想，大破叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在工矿企业推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底改革了旧的技术管理体制，建立了革命三结合的、不脱产的技术管理队伍，由这支队伍来掌管全厂的技术大权。
    这个厂革命三结合的技术管理队伍叫做红专大队。这支队伍在厂革委会领导下，以工人为主体，结合革命干部和革命技术人员组成。现有的四十六名队员，都是厂里抓革命、促生产的骨干，其中三十七名是工人。这些工人中绝大多数是有丰富实践经验的老工人。红专大队中的六名技术员，是全厂三十三名技术人员中同工人结合较好、由工人推选出来的。队长是个老工人，副队长是工人出身的干部，厂革委会主任担任政治指导员。红专大队在每个车间设红专小组，小组组员就是大队队员，小组长绝大部分由车间负责人担任。这个管理全厂技术工作的红专大队，不摆摊摊，不设办公室，除政治指导员外，所有成员都不脱产。经过一段时间的实践，工人们认为这种三结合的技术管理组织有以下好处：
    一、能保证坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更好地突出无产阶级政治。工人们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线理解最深刻，贯彻执行最坚决。他们对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、
  “物质刺激”等修正主义黑货最痛恨。工人阶级掌握了技术领导大权，彻底改变了旧技术队伍脱离无产阶级政治的状况。工人们说：“我们红专大队就是要以无产阶级政治统帅技术，让毛泽东思想牢牢占领技术阵地！”
    二、彻底砍掉了重叠的机构，彻底改变了工程技术人员脱离生产劳动的状况。原来技术管理系统全部改革了，原有的技术管理科室全部取消了。红专大队直属厂革委会领导，红专大队的所有队员都战斗在生产第一线，有了问题在机器旁碰头，研究解决的办法。
    三、有利于大搞群众运动。红专大队是以工人为领导、为主体组织起来的，具有深厚的群众基础，得到群众的热烈支持和拥护。现在红专大队广泛发动群众，破除迷信，自己设计，自己试制，从头到尾有工人群众参加。这样一种生气勃勃的群众运动的局面，和过去只依靠少数“专家”的冷冷清清的情景，形成了显明的对照。
    由于红专大队坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，在技术革新上大搞群众运动，技术革新之花在全厂到处开放。大队成立以来一个多月，全厂提出了较重大的革新项目二十三项，有九项已经改革成功。其中，工业用的无层毡的试制成功，为我国创造了生产这种工业用毡的新的工艺方法。这些事实，有力地证明毛主席指出的“群众是真正的英雄”，“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    四、有利于建立一支无产阶级的技术队伍。许多有实践经验的工人参加了革命三结合的技术管理组织，他们从过去只管一台机器、搞一道工序、干一种劳动，转为掌管一个车间以至全厂的技术大权，他们的组织才能大大提高，发明创造的智慧充分得到发挥。一支不脱离生产的工人技术队伍正在迅速成长。另一方面，也加强了对从旧学校培养出来的技术人员的再教育。红专大队成立以后，原来担负技术管理工作的三十三名技术人员，全部下放到班组，和工人一起学习，一起顶班劳动，这对改造他们的世界观，促使他们更好地为无产阶级政治服务，将会起很大作用。参加红专大队的六名技术员深有感触地说，过去工人叫我们“老师”，我们心安理得，现在参加了生产实践才懂得，工人是我们最好的老师。从旧学校培养出来的技术人员只有坚决接受工人阶级的领导，接受工农兵的再教育，甘当他们的小学生，才能为社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。
