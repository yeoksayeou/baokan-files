During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Team of the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company of Fujian Province actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, striving for strength, and successfully designed and manufactured a 62-meter-high mast-type crane that can lift 60 tons of goods at a time. Now, this innovative, space-saving, high-efficiency, easy-to-operate, and movable mast-type crane is installed on the construction site by the Futu River, swinging its long arms like a giant, lifting heavy boiler parts, and serving socialist construction. The installation workers hung a giant portrait of Chairman Mao on the crane and wrote a large banner reading "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life." Every day, they gather under the crane to report to Chairman Mao in the morning and evening, recite the "Three Constantly Read Articles," study the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and criticize the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's "crawling policy," "slave philosophy," and other revisionist thoughts. With profound proletarian feelings, they shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live, long, long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

After liberation, the installation workers of Fujian, with boundless enthusiasm and energy, participated in socialist construction. Over the past decade, they traveled from coastal areas to mountainous regions, enduring hardships, and installed dozens of large and small hydroelectric stations and thermal power plants for the 17 million people of Fujian. However, in the past, when installing the heavy components of large boilers, they mainly relied on heavy manual labor. Many workers' hands and shoulders were often injured and worn out. They yearned to manufacture a satisfactory crane to reduce labor intensity, improve efficiency, and accelerate the pace of socialist construction! In 1962, at the strong request of the workers, the company agreed to let the workers manufacture the crane themselves. However, those who peddled Liu Shaoqi's revisionist black goods, the bourgeois technical "authorities," heard the workers' suggestions, saw that there were no such records in foreign books, and used the shackles of "not acting rashly" to restrain the workers' hands and feet.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers raised the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," rebelled against a handful of capitalist roaders in the company, smashed the shackles that the bourgeois technical "authorities" used to restrain the workers, and stood up to make a revolution themselves. The entire team selected 20 workers, 3 ordinary technicians, and 1 mid-level cadre to form a "three-in-one" technical revolution small group, which quickly began the trial production of the crane. Their first meeting was to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's "crawling policy" and "slave philosophy," smash the foreign frameworks and foreign dogmas, and decide to build their own crane according to the actual needs of the installation work.

Without ready-made materials and drawings, what kind of machine should they make? How should they make it? They brought these questions to the red book and sought guidance from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "When poor, think of change, be revolutionary. A blank piece of paper has no burden, it is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, good for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them great encouragement and boundless strength. They raised the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and swore to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will definitely use your brilliant thoughts to manufacture our own crane!" They invited veteran workers to share their years of accumulated experience and had technicians record it, analyze it, and elevate it to theory, then write it on paper and draw a rough sketch of the 60-ton mast-type crane. In this way, they designed, modified, and constructed according to production needs and actual conditions, continuously learning and improving in the process.

Throughout the trial production process, they adhered to the principles of self-reliance and efficiency. Without machinery, they used makeshift methods; without long steel, they welded short pieces together; without a forging press, they hammered with a steel hammer. Once, during a trial lift, the cable suddenly stopped. It turned out that the smoothness of the reel's axle was not sufficient. Someone suggested going to the city to find a grinder. The four veteran workers of the lifting team said: "What can be solved on the construction site should not go to the city; what we can do ourselves should not bother others. This is what self-reliance is about!" They used sandpaper to grind the axle, from evening to dawn, finally polishing four axles. The working class can create everything.

The installation workers, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, worked day and night without rest. Many people worked continuously for more than ten hours in the summer heat. They regarded sweating a drop more, drilling a few more holes, welding a few more rods, and hammering a few more times as concrete expressions of their loyalty to Chairman Mao. The five workers in the repair class hammered a "wave cap." Each person swung a 16-pound steel hammer, striking a steel plate about an inch thick, making their whole body numb. On the first day, the five of them only hammered four times, each with eight large blisters, and they couldn't sleep at night due to the pain. They got up to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and hammered again the next day. They fought continuously for five days and completed the task ahead of schedule. The homemade drill press could not meet the drilling needs, so they used the "Practice" as a guiding light, learned from the spirit of the old fool who moved mountains, and used the "ant gnawing at bones" tactic to drill one large hole after another.

During the manufacturing process, they found that they were short of 20 tons of steel. Should they ask the state for help? They firmly refused to do so; but if they did not ask the state for help, they could not find a solution at the moment. What should they do? Someone found a bourgeois technical "authority" and asked him if there was a scientific way to make the crane lift 60 tons of weight with 20 tons less steel. This "authority" arrogantly said: "This scientific method has not been created abroad, and China will not have it either!" The workers, seeing him speak foreign words and look like a slave, angrily said: "Put away your foreign junk! What foreigners don't have, we Chinese will definitely have!" The workers seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Practice," and an old worker, based on his many years of practical experience, conducted countless experiments and finally created a scientific method, solving the problem, saving steel for the state, and once again proving that "the humble are the wisest, and the noble are the most foolish" is a great truth! Fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

The process of manufacturing this crane was also a process of fierce struggle between two lines. When discussing what kind of crane to build, some bourgeois technical "authorities" in the company, in order to gain political capital, brought a pile of drawings and squeezed into the technical innovation small group. The workers took a look at their goods and found that they were all foreign gadgets, so they threw them all back. The workers stood tall and firm, resolutely walking the path of self-reliance.

These bourgeois technical "authorities" were not willing to give up. They colluded with the capitalist roaders in the company, using the power they still held to suppress the workers' creativity with control, pressure, and obstruction. They knew there were steel ropes in the warehouse but insisted there were none. When the workers wanted to seek experience outside, they said: "What do you know? What experience?" They not only did not support the workers materially but also created public opinion politically, slandering the workers. Usually, these people never went to the construction site, but when the first vertical pole test failed, they pretended to be concerned, making phone calls and sending telegrams, calling in a group of directors, bureau chiefs, managers, and chief engineers. These people, upon arriving at the construction site, blamed one for "not conforming to science" and scolded another for "acting recklessly," pouring cold water on the workers.

The working class was not overwhelmed by this reactionary momentum. They stood shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, reading Chairman Mao's teachings aloud time and time again: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by enemies. No matter how difficult and painful the situation is, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." They found lessons, summarized experiences, and made the vow: "Where you fall, get up from there." They treated the manufacturing of the crane as a major political task to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said: "We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and will definitely be able to manufacture the crane! The day our crane is put into use is the day the claws of Liu Shaoqi's henchmen will be forever crushed!" They cut the deformed main pole into sections and welded it back up vertically.

However, a small handful of class enemies were not willing to perish. When the entire team of workers entered the most intense stage of manufacturing the crane, they frantically promoted the bourgeois reactionary line, incited workers to fight against workers, and stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind, attempting to strangle the crane that was about to be born. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the working class of the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company seized the power of the capitalist roaders, and the workers of the Installation Team firmly carried out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, exposed and smashed the enemies' conspiracies, bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and successfully completed the manufacturing of the crane. Looking back on their battle journey, the installation workers deeply felt that without the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the wisdom of the working class would not have been released, and this crane would not have been manufactured. The victory we have achieved is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    活学活用毛泽东思想的凯歌
    ——记福建安装工人奋发图强自造六十吨桅杆式起重机的英雄事迹
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，福建省机电安装工程公司机电安装队的工人群众，活学活用毛泽东思想，奋发图强，自己设计、自己制造成功了一台六十二米高、一次能起重六十吨货物的桅杆式起重机。现在，这台结构新颖、占地小、服务面积大、操作方便、工效高、又能整体移位的桅杆式起重机，已安装在富屯溪畔的工地上，象巨人似地挥舞着长臂，吊着锅炉巨重的部件，为社会主义建设服务。安装工人在起重机上挂起毛主席的巨幅画像，写上“祝福毛主席万寿无疆”的大幅标语，每天围在起重机下面，向毛主席早请示、晚汇报，背诵“老三篇”，学习党的八届十二中全会公报，批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“爬行主义”、“洋奴哲学”等反革命修正主义思想。他们用无比深厚的无产阶级感情，千遍万遍地高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“我们伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”白纸好画最新最美的画图
    解放后，福建安装工人以无比的干劲和热情参加社会主义建设。十年来，他们从沿海到山区，风餐露宿，为福建一千七百万人民安装了几十个大小水电站、热电厂。但是在过去，他们在安装庞大锅炉的一个个沉重部件的时候，多半靠繁重的体力劳动，有些人的手和肩，常常被擦伤、磨破。他们多么渴望能自己制造一台满意的起重机来减轻劳动强度，提高工效，加快社会主义建设的速度啊！一九六二年在工人强烈要求下，公司答应让工人自造起重机。但是，那些贩卖刘少奇的修正主义黑货的资产阶级技术“权威”，听了工人的建议，一看洋书没有这样的记载，便以“不能轻举妄动”的枷锁，束缚了工人的手脚。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大工人群众高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，造了公司一小撮走资派的反，粉碎了资产阶级技术“权威”束缚工人手脚的枷锁，自己起来闹革命。全队抽出了二十个工人、三个普通技术员、一个中层干部，组成了“三结合”技术革命小组，很快开始了试制起重机的工作。他们开的第一次会议，就是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠批刘少奇的“爬行主义”、“洋奴哲学”，彻底砸烂洋框框和洋教条，决心按照安装工作的实际需要，建造自己的起重机。
    没有现成的资料和图样，究竟造什么样的机器？怎么造？他们带着这些问题，翻开红色宝书，向毛主席著作请教。毛主席教导说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”毛主席的教导，给了他们巨大的鼓舞，无穷的力量。他们举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》向毛主席宣誓：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定用您的光辉思想，造出我们自己的起重机来！他们请老工人一次次谈自己多年积累的经验，让技术人员一笔笔记下来，并且加以分析研究，上升到理论，然后写在白纸上，同时画出了六十吨桅杆式起重机的简图。就这样，他们按生产需要，从实际出发，边设计、边修改、边施工，在干中不断学习，不断提高。
    他们在试制过程中，始终坚持自力更生和多快好省的方针。没有机床，用土办法代替；没有长钢材，用短的一节节地焊接；没有锻压机，用钢锤一锤锤敲。有一次起重机在试吊中，拉索忽然停了，一看是卷扬机的游轴光洁度不够。这时，有人建议上城里找磨床磨。起重班四位老工人说：“工地能解决的不进城，自己能干的就不要麻烦人家，这才叫自力更生！”他们用砂纸一张一张在游轴上磨，从晚上磨到天亮，终于磨光了四个游轴。工人阶级能够创造一切
    安装工人怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，废寝忘食，日夜奋战。许多人在炎夏里连续干了十几个钟头不休息。他们把多流一滴汗、多镗几个孔、多烧几根焊条、多打几下钢锤，都看成是向毛主席表忠心的具体表现。修配班五个人打一个“浪风帽”，每人抡起十六磅大钢锤，一锤锤打在寸把厚的钢板上，震得浑身发麻。第一天五个人才打四道，每人就磨起八个大血泡，晚上痛得睡不着觉，就起来学习“老三篇”，第二天照样一锤锤地打。他们连续苦战五天，终于提前完成了任务。加工零件的土钻床不能适应钻孔的需要，他们就以《实践论》为指路明灯，学习老愚公的革命精神，采用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的战术，镗出了一个又一个的大孔。
    在制造中，他们发现钢材还差二十吨。向国家伸手吗？他们坚决不干；可是不向国家伸手，一时又找不到办法。怎么办？有人找到一位资产阶级技术“权威”，问他差二十吨钢材，能不能采用一种科学办法，使这部起重机同样达到起吊六十吨重的目的。这位“权威”很傲慢地说：“这种科学外国还没有创造，中国也不会有！”工人看他说一口洋话，长一副洋奴相，气愤地说：“收起你的洋破烂吧！外国没有的，我们中国一定会有！”工人们认真学习毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》，一位老工人根据自己多年的实践经验，进行了无数次的试验，终于创造了一种科学办法，解决了难题，为国家节省了钢材，再一次证明“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”是伟大的真理！为毛主席的革命路线而战
    这台起重机的制造过程，也是两条路线激烈搏斗的过程。在讨论造什么样的起重机的时候，公司里的一些资产阶级技术“权威”为了捞取政治资本，带了一大堆图样，削尖脑袋钻进了技术革新小组。工人们把他们的货色抖开一看，都是外国的洋玩艺儿，只好统统把它扔了回去。工人们挺胸阔步，坚定不移地走自力更生的道路。
    这些资产阶级技术“权威”并不甘休。他们同公司的走资派勾结在一起，利用手里还掌管的一部分权力，用管、压、卡来束缚工人的创造。他们明知仓库里有钢丝绳，可硬说没有。工人要到外面去取经，他们说：“你们懂得什么，取什么经？”不但在物质上不支持，而且在政治上大造舆论，污蔑工人。平时，这些人从来不到工地去，但当第一次进行立杆倒下试验失败时，他们却装出“关心”的样子，又是打电话，又是拍电报，叫来一批厅长、局长、经理、总工程师。这些人一到工地，就指责这个“不符合科学”，训斥那个“盲干”，向工人群众大泼冷水。
    工人阶级并没有被这股反动气焰所压倒。他们肩并肩、手挽手，立在毛主席像前，一次次高声朗读毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”他们找出教训，总结经验，发出了“那里跌倒，就在那里爬起来”的誓言，把制造起重机当作捍卫毛主席的革命路线的一项重大政治任务来完成。他们说：“我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，一定能把起重机造出来！我们的起重机启用之日，就是刘少奇的爪牙永远完蛋之时！”他们把摔倒变形的主杆一节节割断，又一节节按垂直线焊了起来。
    可是，一小撮阶级敌人并不甘心自己灭亡。当全队工人群众对起重机进入最紧张的制造阶段时，他们又疯狂地推行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，煽动工人离队，妄图扼杀快要诞生的起重机。在人民解放军的帮助下，机电安装工程公司的工人阶级，夺了走资派的权，安装队的工人群众坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，揭穿和粉碎了敌人的阴谋诡计，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的革命路线，胜利地完成了起重机的制造任务。安装工人在回顾自己的战斗历程时，深有体会地说，没有毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，我们工人阶级的智慧就发挥不出来，这台起重机就造不成。我们取得的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
