The Shenyang Smeltery Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, has fully played the leading role of the working class in the extensive study of the history of the struggle between the two lines. It has organized workers' investigation teams for the history of the struggle between the two lines, forming a mass movement in which everyone participates in the investigation and study, everyone is educated, and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao is vigorously praised, while the counter-revolutionary revisionist line is severely criticized. This has greatly raised the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses and has effectively promoted the implementation of the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.

As soon as the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "paying attention to historical experience. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture only a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses" was issued, the nickel smelting workshop in this factory organized workers' investigation teams for the history of the struggle between the two lines on a class and team basis during their spare time. The investigation teams conducted in-depth investigations into the history of the struggle between the two lines in the factory and the workshop. The factory Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory considered this a new phenomenon that emerged in the extensive study of the history of the struggle between the two lines and immediately gave enthusiastic support and actively promoted this practice. Thus, a mass investigation movement was vigorously carried out throughout the factory.

The investigation teams are a good form of promoting the mass movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. The investigation teams are widespread in various workshops, with the broadest mass character. The investigation materials come from the masses, and the investigation results are directly presented to the masses, enabling the broad revolutionary masses to participate in the investigation and study, and everyone is educated. In the lead smelting workshop alone, 70% of the people participated in the investigation.

The investigation teams systematically investigated the situation of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines within the factory, providing a large amount of shocking class struggle facts for the big criticism. They used these new materials, adopting the method of connecting upwards and downwards, to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They deeply felt that without investigating the history of the struggle between the two lines, one would not know; the more one investigates, the more one hates Liu Shaoqi, and the more one investigates, the more loyal one is to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through the investigation of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad masses of workers have a clearer standard of right and wrong, greatly enhancing their awareness of learning and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The investigation teams are also the propaganda teams for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They pay attention to investigating the active thoughts of the masses in the struggle between the lines, carry out mass ideological and political work, and make Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts. In the copper electrolysis workshop, a young worker, after achieving some successes in the revolutionary big criticism, developed the thought that the big criticism was almost done and saw no enemies. The comrades in the investigation team had several heart-to-heart talks with him, criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" with him, laid out the history of the struggle between the two lines within the factory, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and recalled bitterness and sweetness together, which deeply educated him and raised his awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. He recalled the bitter history of his family working for the landlord for generations and said excitedly: "It was the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi who cut off the string of class struggle in my mind. Fortunately, the workers' investigation team armed my mind with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and reconnected the broken string." From then on, he actively joined the workers in the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The investigation teams have strongly promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the factory. The mass investigation activities have laid a net for the class enemies, and the factory has dug out a batch of deeply hidden class enemies. The workers said: "In the past, only a few people conducted investigations, the net was small and the holes were big, and the class enemies had loopholes to exploit; this time, the masses conducted investigations, the net is big and the holes are small, and not a single class enemy can escape."

At present, the mass movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines in the Shenyang Smeltery is becoming more and more in-depth and solid. The broad masses of workers unanimously expressed: They must let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line take deep root in their minds, thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and continuously consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    沈阳冶炼厂在两条路线斗争史学习中发挥工人阶级领导作用
    广泛组织两条路线斗争史工人调查组
    全厂迅速形成人人参加调查、人人参加学习的群众性运动。调查组调查的本厂阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的大量事实，不断为革命大批判提供新的材料
    本报讯　沈阳冶炼厂革委会在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，在深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，广泛组织工人两条路线斗争史调查组，形成一个人人搞调查，人人参加学习，人人受教育，狠批反革命修正主义路线，大颂毛主席革命路线的群众运动，极大地提高了广大革命群众的两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了八届十二中全会公报提出各项战斗任务的落实。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示一发表，这个厂的镍冶炼车间就以班、组为单位，自动组织了工人两条路线斗争史调查组。调查组利用业余时间，深入调查本厂、本车间两条路线斗争的历史。厂革委会和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队认为，这是深入开展两条路线斗争史学习运动中涌现出的新事物，立即满腔热忱地给予支持，并大力推广了这种作法。于是，一个群众性的调查运动在全厂蓬蓬勃勃开展起来。
    调查组是推动群众性两条路线斗争史学习运动的好形式。调查组遍布各个车间，有最广泛的群众性。调查的材料来源于群众，调查的结果直接和群众见面，使广大革命群众人人参加学习，人人参加调查，人人受到教育。仅铅冶炼一个车间就有百分之七十的人参加了调查。
    调查组全面系统地调查了厂内两个阶级、两条路线斗争情况，大量触目惊心的阶级斗争事实，不断为大批判提供了新材料。他们利用新材料，采取上挂下连的办法，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，热情颂扬毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们深深体会到，两条路线斗争史不查不知道，越查对刘少奇越恨，越查对毛主席革命路线越忠。通过调查两条路线斗争的历史，广大职工是非标准更明确，大大增强了学习和贯彻毛主席革命路线的自觉性。
    调查组还是毛主席革命路线的宣传队。他们注意调查群众在路线斗争中的活思想，开展群众性的思想政治工作，使毛主席的革命路线深入人心。铜电解车间一个青年工人在革命大批判取得一些成绩后，产生了大批判搞得差不多了的思想，眼里看不见敌人。调查组的同志多次和他谈心，和他一起批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大摆厂内两条路线斗争的历史，热情颂扬毛主席的革命路线，一起忆苦思甜，使他受到很深的教育，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他回忆了他家几辈为地主扛活的苦难家史，激动地说：“是中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇砍断了我头脑中阶级斗争这根弦，多亏工人调查组用毛主席的革命路线武装了我的头脑，把断了的弦又接上了。”从此，他积极地和工人们一起投入了斗、批、改的战斗。调查组还用调查得来的材料办了一个两条路线斗争教育展览馆，组织大家参观学习。工人们赞扬说：“工人两条路线斗争史调查组是毛主席革命路线的宣传队！”
    调查组有力地推动了本厂的斗、批、改。群众性的调查活动给阶级敌人布下了天罗地网，全厂又挖出了一批隐藏很深的阶级敌人。工人们说：“过去少数人调查，网小眼大，阶级敌人还有空子可钻；这回群众人人搞调查，网大眼小，阶级敌人一个也漏不掉。”
    目前，沈阳冶炼厂群众性的两条路线斗争史学习运动，开展得越来越深入，越来越扎实，广大工人一致表示：一定要让毛主席革命路线在头脑中深深扎根，把刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线批深批臭，不断巩固无产阶级专政。
