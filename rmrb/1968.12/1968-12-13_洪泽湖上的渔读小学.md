Under the radiant sunlight of Chairman Mao's great educational thoughts, Jiangsu Province's Hongze County Laoshan Commune and Bancheng Commune have, since 1962, established fifteen new types of lake schools—fishery schools—among twelve fishery brigades. These schools now have 730 students. The children of fishermen are growing up healthily under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

Thanks to Chairman Mao, we have our own schools.

In the old society, the impoverished fishermen of Hongze Lake were trampled underfoot by feudal fishery tyrants and other reactionary forces. They spent their entire lives drifting on the lake, and generation after generation did not know how to read. There was a poor fisherman whose family had not had anyone attend school for eight generations. He sold his fishing gear to send his son to a private school, but the result was that the dog landlord stuck his eyes with a plaster and locked him in a dark room. In the end, the family was ruined before they could find the child and bring him back home. After liberation, Chairman Mao saved the fishermen from their sea of suffering. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, not only failing to provide education for the fishermen but also making it difficult for the children of fishermen to study on shore. Some children carried their luggage and food to study on shore, but public schools had various barriers such as entrance exams, age limits, and tuition fees, which kicked them out of school.

Chairman Mao's instruction on "community and brigade-run schools, where conditions permit, should be allowed to be established" pointed the way forward for the fishermen. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, overcame difficulties on their own, and established fishery schools on the lake, joyfully sending their children to school. At the opening ceremony, a poor fisherman from Laoshan Commune brought his child to stand before Chairman Mao's portrait, bowed, and said with tears of joy, "Thanks to Chairman Mao, we have our own school. Child, these books are given to you by Chairman Mao! Our family has not known how to read for generations. You must make Chairman Mao proud!"

Schools without classrooms

Fishermen often go out to sea to fish, leading a nomadic and scattered life, and the lake is vast and empty. Where should the school be built? They had a solution: on the reed and thatch banks where they frequently moored their boats, they piled up earth to create a base and built a beachhead school. They had no money to run the school, but they had a solution: they built thatched houses with their own hands, made mud desks and mud stools.

Many brigades in Laoshan Commune did not have the conditions to build school buildings on the beach, so the fishermen cleared out their living boats to establish boathead schools. Those who had difficulty clearing the boats adopted the method used by the New Fourth Army during their guerrilla warfare on the lake, cutting reeds in shallow water to build reed mounds, and teaching on the mounds.

Fishery school students did not pay tuition fees. The school's operational expenses and students' book fees were solved by teachers leading students to cut reeds, pick lotus flowers, gather wild lotus roots, dig wild lotus stems, pick lotus leaves, and collect wild eggs to sell for money. To save paper and pens, the Chuyang Fishery School in Laoshan Commune often chose to teach on sandy ground, using willow branches as pens and the ground as paper to practice writing.

A handful of class enemies were terrified and hated these newly established schools. They spread rumors and tried to sabotage the schools. They maliciously said that fishery schools were "irregular" and "not up to standard," and even wrote a couplet to curse these schools. The poor fishermen fought back against the class enemies, subdued their arrogance, and wrote a couplet to praise their own schools: "Mud desks, mud stools, thatched houses, new people, new things, new classrooms." The horizontal scroll read: "Inheriting the tradition of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University."

Mud-legged teachers

Chairman Mao taught, "The most important problem is to select principals and teachers and to determine the educational policy." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, as soon as the fishery schools were established, an educational leadership group was formed, consisting of poor fishermen, brigade revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students, to manage all school affairs. The brigade's main responsible cadres served as principals. Poor fishermen and brigade cadres served as part-time teachers, and full-time teachers were selected and hired by the poor fishermen themselves. Teachers' salaries were not higher than the income of ordinary fishermen in the brigade. They are currently discussing the abolition of fixed salaries and evaluating work points like commune members. Teachers often labor with the fishermen, and most of them eat at fishermen's homes. Some even live on fishermen's boats. Under the education of the fishermen, the original "mud-legged" teachers retained the character of the working people, and teachers with a bit of old intellectual flavor became "mud-legged."

The poor fishermen happily said, "With such good teachers, we can entrust our children to the school with peace of mind."

Loyal to Chairman Mao's "Three-in-One" cadres

Fishery schools followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "serve proletarian politics and combine education with productive labor" to cultivate a new generation for the fishermen.

The children of fishery schools are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They study and apply Chairman Mao's quotations, following Chairman Mao's instructions to do good deeds for the people. When some children did good deeds and were thanked by the people, they always replied, "You should thank Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught us to be selfless and dedicated to others! I am acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

The children of fishery schools love the collective, have high revolutionary vigilance, and are brave and tenacious. To defend Chairman Mao and the motherland, some primary schools learn swimming in the summer, run in the snow in the winter, have military physical education classes to compete in boat racing, practice aiming on boats, and conduct "clearing the beach" exercises to "surround and annihilate the enemy" on reed banks.

The children of fishery schools love labor and are bold and capable. Older students generally know how to use more than five kinds of tools to catch fish, work like little tigers, and are often covered in mud. In winter, they even go barefoot into the water.

The biggest feature of the children of fishery schools is their passionate promotion of Mao Zedong Thought. Yang Jinhua, a female student from Chuyang Fishery School in Laoshan Commune, actively helped her family organize a Mao Zedong Thought cultural propaganda team, with all eight family members enthusiastically singing and praising Mao Zedong Thought; some children taught Mao Zedong Thought to their entire family as soon as they learned a quotation from Chairman Mao. Four students from Hong'an Primary School in Bancheng Commune helped illiterate fishermen study Chairman Mao's works, enabling more than fifty fishermen to memorize the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Fishermen praised them as the "Three-in-One" cadres loyal to Chairman Mao: propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, instructors of studying Chairman Mao's works, and little teachers teaching Mao Zedong Thought to fishermen.

    洪泽湖上的渔读小学
    在毛主席的伟大教育思想的灿烂阳光照耀下，江苏省洪泽县老山公社和半城公社的十二个渔业大队，从一九六二年起先后办起了十五所新型的湖上小学——渔读小学，现有学生七百三十多人，这些渔民的子女，正在毛泽东思想哺育下茁壮成长。托毛主席的福我们有了自己的学校
    在旧社会，洪泽湖上的贫苦渔民被封建渔霸等反动势力踩在脚底下，加上长年在湖上东飘西泊，家家户户、祖祖辈辈不识字。有个上数八代没有上过学的贫苦渔民，发狠心卖了渔具送儿子进了私塾，可结果被狗地主用膏药贴住眼睛关进了黑屋子，最后弄得倾家荡产才把小孩找回家。解放了，毛主席把渔民救出了苦海，可是大叛徒刘少奇推行反革命修正主义教育路线，不但不为渔民办学，渔民子弟上岸读书也受到种种刁难。有的孩子背行李、带口粮到岸上去上学，公办学校什么考试关、年龄关、学费关，又把他们踢出了校门。
    毛主席的“关于社办、队办学校问题，有条件的应该允许办”的教导，为渔民指明了前进的方向。他们遵照毛主席的教导，自己动手克服困难，在湖上办起了渔读小学，欢天喜地地把自己的孩子送进了学校。在开学的时候，老山公社一个贫苦渔民把孩子带到毛主席像前敬了个礼，喜泪盈眶地说：“托毛主席的福，我们有了自己的学校了。孩子，这书是毛主席给你念的！我们家祖辈不识字，你可要为毛主席争口气啊！”没有教室的学校
    渔民经常出湖打鱼，时常过着流动、分散的生活，湖上又是茫茫一片水，学校建在那里？他们有办法：在自己经常停船的芦柴滩上堆土垫基，建起了滩头小学。没有钱靠什么来办学？他们也有办法：靠自己的双手盖起了草房，搭起了泥桌和泥凳。
    老山公社许多大队没有条件在滩头建校舍，渔民们就腾出住家船办起船头小学。腾船有困难的，渔民和师生们就采取当年新四军在湖上打游击时采用的办法，采割湖草在浅水处堆起草墩，在草墩上教学。
    渔读小学的学生入学不收学费。学校的办公费、学生的簿本费，都由教师领着学生到湖里割草、掐芦花、采野菱、挖野藕、打荷叶、拾野蛋卖钱来解决。为了节省纸笔，老山公社朝阳渔读小学还经常选择在沙地教课，柳枝作笔地作纸，教学生练习书写。
    一小撮阶级敌人对这些新生的小学怕得要死，恨得要命。他们煽阴风，点鬼火，妄想把学校搞垮。他们胡说渔读小学“不正规”，“不象样”，还恶毒地编了副对联来诅咒这些小学。贫苦渔民们对阶级敌人进行了坚决的斗争，打下了他们的威风，并且也编写了一副对联，来歌颂自己的学校：“泥桌泥凳泥草房，新人新事新学堂”，横批是：“抗大传统”。泥腿子教师
    毛主席教导说：“最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针。”遵照毛主席的教导，渔读小学一建立，就成立了有贫苦渔民、大队革命干部和学校革命师生代表组成的教育领导小组，掌管学校的一切大权，并且由大队的主要负责干部兼任校长。贫苦渔民和大队干部做兼职教师，专职教师由贫苦渔民自己聘请、挑选。教师的工资不高于本大队一般渔民的收入水平。现正在讨论取消固定工资，和社员一样评工记分。教师经常和渔民一起劳动，大多数在渔民家中带饭，有的借住在渔民船上。在渔民教育下，原来的“泥腿子”教师保持了劳动人民的本色，有点旧知识分子味儿的教师也变成了“泥腿子”。贫苦渔民们高兴地说：“有这样的好教师，我们把孩子交给学校就放心了。”忠于毛主席的“三大员”
    渔读小学遵照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导办事，为渔民培养了一代新人。
    渔读小学的孩子，无限忠于毛主席。他们活学活用毛主席语录，遵照毛主席教导为群众做好事。有些孩子做了好事受到群众感谢的时候，总是回答说：“你要感谢毛主席。毛主席教导我们要做毫不利己专门利人的人！我是按照毛主席的指示办事的。”
    渔读小学的孩子热爱集体，革命警惕性高，勇敢顽强。为了保卫毛主席、保卫祖国，有的小学夏天学游泳，冬天在雪地练跑步，上军体课搞划船竞渡，在船上学瞄准，还在芦柴滩进行围剿“敌人”的“清滩演习”。
    渔读小学的孩子热爱劳动，泼辣能干。较大的学生一般都会使用五种以上的工具捕鱼，干活象个小老虎，经常满身泥巴，冬天还赤脚下水。
    渔读小学的孩子们最大的特点，是满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想。老山公社朝阳渔读小学女学生杨锦花，积极帮助全家组织了毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，全家八人，人人大颂大唱毛泽东思想；有的孩子每学会一条毛主席语录，就立即教给全家人。半城公社洪安小学的四个学生，分头帮助不识字的渔民学习毛主席著作，使五十多个渔民学会背诵“老三篇”。渔民们称赞他们是忠于毛主席的三大员：毛泽东思想宣传员、学习毛主席著作辅导员、向渔民教毛主席语录的小教员。
