"After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably engage in a life-and-death struggle with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." The great leader Chairman Mao's teaching is the great guideline for the socialist revolution, a powerful ideological weapon for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. However, the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi has repeatedly come out to sing the opposite tune. He hysterically shouts that "the enemies of the Chinese revolution—imperialism, the Kuomintang, and the bureaucrat capitalists—have fled, been eliminated, and no longer exist." "Now the domestic enemies have basically been eliminated, ... the main class struggles within the country have basically ended, or have basically been resolved," and so on.

Have imperialists really "fled"? No! Just as the great spy Liu Shaoqi was ranting about imperialists "fleeing," American imperialism launched a mad war of aggression against Korea, pointing its spearhead at the newly born People's Republic of China. Under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people waged a great war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, defeating the most ferocious enemy in the world, American imperialism. American imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, colludes with Soviet revisionists and reactionaries of various countries to form an anti-China encirclement, and frequently engages in sabotage and disruption against our country. This year, the brother units in our region have consecutively shot down three U.S. unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. Can this be said to be imperialists "fleeing"?

Has "the main class struggle within the country basically ended"? Absolutely not! The facts of class struggle over the past nineteen years since the founding of the country prove that class struggle has not "ended" but is very fierce and very complex. It is precisely under the cover of Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" that the bourgeoisie and their agents, as well as the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, unwilling to accept their defeat, dream of using their remaining counter-revolutionary forces in politics, ideology, and culture to launch a mad attack on socialism. The counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, under Liu Shaoqi's protection, fiercely opposed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings that "politics is the commander, the soul," and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and promoted the bourgeois line of building the military. The broad cadres and soldiers firmly upheld proletarian politics, adhered to Chairman Mao's principles of political military construction, severely criticized the reactionary fallacies of "technology first," and resolutely resisted the schemes to gather technical experts and hold large-scale competitions, smashing their evil plots to lead our army astray and restore capitalism. The history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years is even more permeated with the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. Domestic class enemies have not been eliminated; they are always dreaming of restoring their lost paradise and attempting to rise again. These shocking facts—can they be said to prove that class struggle has "extinguished"?

Then, why did the old counter-revolutionary Liu Shaoqi spread the "theory of the extinction of class struggle"? As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there is still a part of society that dreams of restoring the capitalist system. They will fight against the working class from all sides, including the ideological front." The great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi is the representative of this part of people, the black commander. He denied the transitional period's classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," to establish a counter-revolutionary regime of landlords, capitalists, and Kuomintang reactionaries that brutally suppresses the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals. This is in line with the needs of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to subvert our proletarian dictatorship as a smokescreen. Liu Shaoqi is the spokesman for the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the faithful running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Every time at the critical moment of the revolution, he always stands on the reactionary position of domestic and foreign class enemies to sing the opposite tune with our great leader Chairman Mao, engaging in a life-and-death struggle against the proletariat. Advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" is the ironclad evidence of Liu Shaoqi's loyalty to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

    大叛徒刘少奇效忠帝修反的铁证
    战斗英雄　张积慧
    “在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，是社会主义革命的伟大纲领，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的强大思想武器。可是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇却一次又一次地跳出来唱反调。他歇斯底里地狂叫什么“中国革命的敌人——帝国主义、国民党、官僚资本家跑掉了，消灭了，没有了。”“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭，……国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了，或者说基本上解决了”等等。
    帝国主义真的“跑掉了”吗？没有！正当大内奸刘少奇胡说帝国主义“跑掉了”的时候，美帝国主义疯狂地发动了侵朝战争，把矛头指向刚刚诞生的中华人民共和国。在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民进行了伟大的抗美援朝战争，打败了美帝这个世界上最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义至今仍然霸占着我国的领土台湾，与苏修和各国反动派勾结，建立了反华包围圈，对我国经常地进行破坏和捣乱。今年我们所在地区的兄弟部队，就连续击落了三架美帝无人驾驶高空侦察机。这能说是帝国主义“跑掉了”吗？
      “国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”吗？同样没有！建国十九年来的阶级斗争事实，证明阶级斗争非但没有“结束”，而是十分激烈，十分复杂。正是在刘少奇所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”这把黑色保护伞的掩护下，资产阶级和他们的代理人，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右不甘心于他们的失败，梦想利用他们在政治上、思想上、文化上的反革命残余势力，疯狂地向社会主义进攻。反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，就是在刘少奇卵翼下，拚死地反对伟大领袖毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行资产阶级建军路线。广大指战员坚定不移地突出无产阶级政治，坚持毛主席的政治建军原则，狠狠批判了“技术第一”等反动谬论，坚决抵制了拼凑技术尖子、搞大比武，粉碎了他们妄图把我军引上邪路、进行复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。两年来无产阶级文化大革命的历史，更是贯穿着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。国内阶级敌人并没有消灭，他们无时无刻不在梦想恢复他们已经失去的天堂，妄图东山再起。这些触目惊心的事实，能说阶级斗争“熄灭了”吗？！
    那么，老反革命分子刘少奇为什么要大肆散布“阶级斗争熄灭论”呢？这正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇就是这部分人的总代表、黑司令。他否认过渡时期的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，是为了建立一个地主、资本家和国民党反动派残酷镇压工人阶级、贫下中农和革命知识分子的反革命政权的需要，是配合帝、修、反颠覆我国无产阶级专政的烟幕弹。刘少奇就是没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右的代言人，就是帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗。每当革命的紧要关头，他总是站在国内外阶级敌人的反动立场上同我们伟大领袖毛主席唱对台戏，向无产阶级作“拚死的斗争”。鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”就是刘少奇效忠于帝、修、反的铁证。
