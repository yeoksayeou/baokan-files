We were deeply moved and overjoyed when we heard the report on the cooperative medical system implemented in Le Yuan Commune, Changyang County, Hubei Province, and the important editorial note from the People's Daily during our rounds of medical treatment for the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside. The implementation of the cooperative medical system in rural areas is a great revolution in the medical and health sector, a good measure to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian health line.

Some rural cadres and medical personnel are concerned about what to do if the cooperative medical fund is insufficient after the implementation of the cooperative medical system. We would like to express our views on this issue.

Based on our several years of practical experience working with rural medical personnel to treat diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants, we believe that as long as we trust the masses, rely on the masses, and implement the "prevention first" and "combine indigenous and modern methods" policies, we can achieve the goal of spending less money and treating more diseases, fully utilizing the cooperative medical fund. From our perspective as medical personnel, we should do the following:

1. We must implement the "prevention first" policy and carry out mass health work. Great Leader Mao Zedong teaches us: "The autocrats benefit from the people's ignorance, while we benefit from the people's enlightenment. We want all the people to gradually get out of ignorance and unhealthy conditions." Whether or not to carry out mass health work is a struggle over whether to thoroughly change the rural health situation, and a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths. Since 1962, following Chairman Mao's teachings, we have successively carried out "health villages" activities in over 800 villages and towns. This mass patriotic health campaign has improved the environment, enhanced the masses' physical fitness, and significantly reduced the incidence of diseases. We believe that medical personnel should regard carrying out mass health work as a political task and put great effort into it. If we only treat diseases without preventing them, once an epidemic breaks out, it will endanger the masses' lives and health and also increase the expenditure of the cooperative medical fund.

2. We should fully utilize the vast amount of disease prevention and treatment experience accumulated by the broad peasantry, as well as the effective and scientifically sound "indigenous remedies." As the saying goes, "folk remedies can cure serious diseases." Last summer, a production team suffered from dysentery. At that time, we mobilized the masses to contribute their ideas and adopted the effective folk remedies proposed by the masses, such as "boiling sorghum water mixed with red sugar," "plantain soup," and "garlic juice," combined with acupuncture, and quickly stopped the spread of dysentery. Each patient only spent a few cents. With the implementation of the cooperative medical system, the poor and lower-middle peasants have control over medical care. As long as we medical personnel establish the idea of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly, humbly learn from the masses, and gather the masses' wisdom, fully utilizing "indigenous remedies" and "folk remedies," we can definitely achieve the goal of spending less money and treating more diseases.

3. Based on the specific situation in rural areas, we should implement the "combine indigenous and modern methods" policy, promote acupuncture therapy, and mobilize the masses to collect herbs themselves. Over the years, we have treated diseases for the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, with 95% relying on acupuncture and herbs. Acupuncture and herbs not only cured a large number of common diseases such as stomachaches, back and leg pain, and bronchitis but also cured many difficult diseases such as deaf-mutism and epilepsy. This year, we have treated diseases for over 50,000 poor and lower-middle peasants in 12 communes. Each person spent an average of only one jiao in medical fees, with the most spending no more than a few yuan. The masses say, "Acupuncture and cupping, even if it doesn't work, it will reduce the pain by half." Acupuncture therapy is easy to learn, effective, and the production team's health workers can learn it in two or three months. Buying a dozen silver needles for a few yuan allows them to treat diseases for the community members at any time. Herbs are abundant in many rural areas, and collecting and processing them into traditional Chinese medicine is both effective and economical. As long as we medical personnel actively implement the "combine indigenous and modern methods" policy and fully utilize acupuncture and herbs, we can cure diseases and save medical expenses.

In summary, we believe that whether rural health work can implement the principle of "spending less money and treating more diseases" is not just a matter of how much money is spent, but more importantly, it is a matter of which health line to follow, whether we have the masses in our eyes, and it is also an important issue for the consolidation of the rural cooperative medical system. We medical personnel must establish the idea of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly, truly trust the masses, rely on the masses, and make a thorough change in our thoughts and feelings, and work style. Only then can we actively implement the "prevention first" policy, better serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, achieve the goal of spending less money and treating more diseases, and do a good job of consolidating the rural cooperative medical system.

    相信群众　依靠群众　预防为主　土洋结合
    我们在农村为贫下中农进行巡回医疗的时候，听到了湖北省长阳县乐园公社实行合作医疗制度的报道和《人民日报》的重要编者按。我们非常激动，非常高兴！农村实行合作医疗制度，这是医疗卫生战线上的一场大革命，是坚决贯彻毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示的好措施，是毛主席无产阶级卫生路线的伟大胜利。
    有的农村干部和农村医务人员担心合作医疗制度实行以后，合作医疗基金不够用怎么办？我们想就这个问题发表些意见。
    根据我们几年来和农村医务人员共同为贫下中农治病的实践经验，我们认为，只要相信群众，依靠群众，贯彻“预防为主”，“土洋结合”的方针，就可以做到少花钱，多治病，充分发挥合作医疗基金的作用。从我们医务人员来说，应该做到以下几点：
    一、必须贯彻“预防为主”的方针，开展群众性的卫生工作。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“专制主义者利于人民愚昧，我们则利于人民聪明，我们要使一切人民都能逐渐地离开愚昧状态与不卫生的状态。”开展不开展群众性的卫生工作，这是一场关系到要不要彻底改变农村卫生面貌的斗争，是一场关系到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。一九六二年以来，我们根据毛主席的教导，先后在八百多个村镇，开展了“卫生村”的活动。这个群众性的爱国卫生运动，改造了环境，增强了群众的体质，使发病率大大减少。我们认为，医务人员应该把开展群众性的卫生工作当作一项政治任务，下大力去抓。如果只管治病，不管预防，一旦疫病发生，就会危害群众的生命和健康，也要增加合作医疗基金的支出。
    二、充分运用广大农民积累的大量防病治病的经验和行之有效、合乎科学的“土方”。俗话说：“偏方治大病”。去年夏天，一个生产队流行痢疾，当时我们就发动群众献计献策，采取了群众提出的用“高粱熬水拌红糖”、“车前子汤”、“大蒜汁”等行之有效的治痢疾的“土方”，又配合用针灸，很快就制止了痢疾的流行。每个病人只花了几分钱。实行合作医疗制度，贫下中农掌握了医疗大权，只要我们医务人员树立全心全意为贫下中农服务的思想，虚心地向群众学习，把群众的智慧集中起来，充分运用“土方”“偏方”，是完全可以做到少花钱，多治病的。
    三、根据农村的具体情况，实行“土洋结合”，推广针灸疗法和发动群众自己采集草药。几年来，我们为广大贫下中农治病，百分之九十五是靠针灸和草药。针灸和草药，不仅治好了大量胃疼、腰腿疼、气管炎等常见病，也治好了很多聋哑、癫癎等疑难病。今年一年，我们就为十二个公社的五万多名贫下中农治好了病。每人平均只花医疗费一角钱，最多的也不超过几元钱。群众说：“扎针拔罐子，不好也去一半子”。针灸疗法容易学，疗效好，生产队卫生员学两三个月，花块把钱买十几根银针，就可以随时为社员治病。草药，许多农村都有，采集起来，制成中药，既管用，又经济。只要我们医务人员积极实行“土洋结合”，充分运用针灸、草药，就可以治好疾病，并节省医疗费。
    总之，我们觉得，农村卫生工作能不能贯彻
  “少花钱，多治病”的原则，这不仅是花钱多少的问题，更重要的是执行什么卫生路线、眼睛里有没有群众的根本问题，也是农村合作医疗制度能不能巩固的重要问题。我们医务人员，只有树立全心全意为贫下中农服务的思想，真正相信群众，依靠群众，在思想感情、工作作风上来个彻底的转变，才能积极贯彻“预防为主”的方针，更好地为贫下中农服务，做到少花钱，多治病，搞好和巩固农村的合作医疗制度。
