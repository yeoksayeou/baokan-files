In 1955, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote a preface for the article "Experience in Cooperativization in One Village." Chairman Mao instructed: "All those intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should gladly go there. The countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." This village was then known as Dali Village in Xing County, Henan. Now, it is the "Vast Countryside, Great Achievements" People's Commune. Chairman Mao's great directive pointed out the path of revolutionization for the youth. Batch after batch of young intellectuals enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, rushing to the countryside and tempering themselves in the three great revolutionary movements.

Just as Chairman Mao's great directive was becoming deeply ingrained in people's minds, the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi secretly went to Xuchang, frenziedly attacking Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and peddling counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as the "study to become an official" theory, the "go to the countryside to gild oneself" theory, and the "suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage" theory.

In this place, the poor and lower-middle peasants insisted on using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to educate and cultivate the youth, helping them grow in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Over the past decade, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have brought back their children who graduated from school, batch after batch, to the countryside. They have educated them on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, organizing them to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. However, a small handful of capitalist roaders, following the orders of their black master Liu Shaoqi, have stretched out their black hands here. They use "higher education" and "becoming an official" as bait, scheming to pull the young intellectuals out of the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants promptly educated the young intellectuals on the struggle between the two lines. With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the young intellectuals here have resolutely marched forward on the path indicated by Chairman Mao, unyielding in the face of wind and waves, determined to cultivate themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Currently, the "Vast Countryside, Great Achievements" People's Commune has over 400 young intellectuals. They are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, rapidly growing in the vast expanse of the countryside.

### “广阔天地”是培养革命接班人的大学校

    “广阔天地”是培养革命接班人的大学校
    一九五五年，我们伟大领袖毛主席为《在一个乡里进行合作化规划的经验》一文加了按语。毛主席教导说：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”这个乡是当时的河南郏县的大李庄乡，现在这里是广阔天地大有作为人民公社。毛主席的这一伟大指示，给知识青年指出了革命化的道路。一批批的知识青年，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，奔赴农村，在三大革命运动中锻炼成长。
    正当毛主席的伟大指示日益深入人心的时候，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇偷偷地溜到许昌，疯狂攻击毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，到处贩卖“读书做官论”、“下乡镀金论”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等反革命修正主义黑货。
    这里的贫下中农，坚持用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线教育和培养青年，使他们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中成长。十几年来，广大贫下中农把自己从学校毕业的子女，一批一批地接回农村，对他们进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育，组织他们活学活用毛泽东思想。但是，一小撮走资派秉承其黑主子刘少奇的旨意，把黑手伸进这里，他们以“升学”、“做官”为诱饵，阴谋把知识青年从农村拉出去。贫下中农及时地对知识青年进行了两条路线斗争的教育。在贫下中农的帮助下，这里的知识青年坚决沿着毛主席指引的道路向前迈进，风吹不回头，浪打不动摇，决心把自己培养成为永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    目前，广阔天地大有作为人民公社已有四百多名知识青年。他们活学活用毛主席著作，正在农村的广阔天地里迅速成长。　新华社通讯员　新华社记者　（本报略有删节）
