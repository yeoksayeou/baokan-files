Sato Delivers Counter-Revolutionary "Policy Speech"
	Reiterates Anti-China, Anti-Communist, Anti-People Rhetoric; Insists on Continuing to Align with U.S. Imperialism, Collude with Soviet Revisionism, and Oppose the People of All Countries
	Admits that the Reactionary Government "Faces Many Difficulties" and Life is Hard

	BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) - TOKYO - Japanese reactionary Prime Minister Sato Eisaku delivered a "policy speech" at the extraordinary session of the Diet on Dec. 11, stubbornly insisting on pursuing a counter-revolutionary policy of aligning with U.S. imperialism, colluding with Soviet revisionism, and opposing China, communism, and the people.

	This was Sato's first "policy speech" since he reshuffled his cabinet late last month.

	In his "speech," Sato shouted that the Japanese reactionary government will "continue to maintain friendly relations with the United States" and provide "cooperation" for U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy.

	When discussing the Okinawa issue, Sato further exposed his reactionary stance. He bluntly stated, "In the future, (the Japanese government) will continue to stand on the basis of mutual trust with the United States and according to (the United States') security guarantee requirements," to handle the Okinawa issue. Japanese bourgeois newspapers pointed out that this is actually to allow U.S. troops to continue to stay in Okinawa.

	When discussing the Vietnam issue, Sato vigorously praised the "peace talks" trick played by U.S. imperialism and expressed his willingness to continue to serve U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. He shouted that the Japanese government will play a "role" in the Vietnam issue in the future.

	Sato's "speech" also indicated that the Japanese reactionary ruling class is terrified and hates the brave struggle of Japanese students against the rotten bourgeois education system and the evil rule of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, as well as the increasingly high tide of the anti-U.S. mass movement. Sato openly threatened Japanese students not to "take extreme actions" and shouted for students to "maintain" the so-called "order" of bourgeois society.

	At present, the Japanese people's anti-U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," anti-U.S. military bases, patriotic and just struggle against U.S. imperialism is surging higher and higher, and the Japanese reactionary ruling class is having a hard time. Sato had to admit in his "speech" that today, the Japanese reactionary ruling class "faces many difficulties," and the Japanese reactionary ruling class is facing a "new test." Sato's words reflect the gloomy mood of the Japanese reactionary ruling class in the face of an unprecedented serious political crisis, reflecting that their days are getting worse.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, with the support of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries use "economic diplomacy" as a means to intensify their expansion into Southeast Asia, attempting to re-conquer Asia.

	It is precisely from this economic expansionist ambition that Japanese monopolistic capital is doing everything possible to export capital to Southeast Asia. According to recent statistics, from the end of World War II to 1963, the total amount of capital exported by Japan to Southeast Asia for various purposes has reached $2.5 billion. And from 1964, when the U.S. lackey Sato Eisaku came to power, to 1967, Japan exported nearly $2.2 billion in capital to Southeast Asia. This shows that the pace of external expansion of the Sato reactionary government is much faster than that of any post-war Japanese government.

    佐藤发表反革命“施政演说”
    重弹反华反共反人民滥调　坚持要继续投靠美帝，勾结苏修，同各国人民为敌
    承认反动政府“面临着许许多多困难”日子很不好过
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：日本反动政府首相佐藤荣作十一日在临时国会全体会议上发表“施政演说”，顽固坚持推行投靠美帝、勾结苏修，反华、反共、反人民的反革命政策。
    这是佐藤荣作在上月底改组内阁后发表的第一次“施政演说”。
    佐藤在“演说”中叫嚷，日本反动政府今后“要继续维护日美友好关系”，要为美帝的反革命全球战略“提供合作”。
    佐藤在谈到冲绳问题时，进一步暴露了他的反动立场。他露骨地声称，“今后（日本政府）继续站在与美国相互信赖的基础上，并根据（美国）提出的安全保障的要求”，处理冲绳问题。日本资产阶级报纸指出，这实际上是为了让美国军队继续赖在冲绳不走。
    佐藤在谈到越南问题时，极力吹捧美帝玩弄的“和谈”骗局，并且表示要继续为美帝侵越战争效劳。他叫嚷日本政府今后要在越南问题上起“作用”。
    佐藤的“演说”还表明：日本反动统治集团对日本大学生反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度、反对美日反动派的罪恶统治的英勇斗争以及日益高涨的反美群众运动，怕得要死，恨得要命。佐藤公然威胁日本大学生不要“采取过激行动”，并叫嚷要学生“维护”资产阶级社会的所谓“秩序”。
    目前，日本人民反对日美“安全条约”，反对美国军事基地的反美爱国正义斗争一浪高过一浪，日本反动统治集团的日子很不好过。佐藤在“演说”中不得不承认，今天，日本反动统治集团“面临着许许多多的困难”，日本反动统治阶级正在面临着“新的考验”。佐藤的这番话反映了日本反动统治集团在空前严重的政治危机面前的黯淡心情，反映了他们的日子越来越不好过了。
    据新华社讯　在美帝国主义支持下，日本反动派以“经济外交”为手段，加紧向东南亚进行扩张，妄图重新称霸亚洲。
    正是从这一经济扩张的野心出发，日本垄断资本千方百计地向东南亚输出资本。据最近统计，从第二次世界大战后到一九六三年，日本以各种名义向东南亚输出资本的总额，已达二十五亿美元。而从一九六四年美帝走狗佐藤荣作上台到一九六七年的三年间，日本又向东南亚输出资本近二十二亿美元。这表明，佐藤反动政府的对外扩张步伐比起战后任何一届日本政府都大大地加快了。
