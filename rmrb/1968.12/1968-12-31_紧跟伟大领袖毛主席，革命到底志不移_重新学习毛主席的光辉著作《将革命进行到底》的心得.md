The revolutionary tide surges forward; the wheels of history roll on. The great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" has been published for twenty years. Today, as the working class takes the stage in the superstructure to lead the masses of revolutionary people nationwide in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and as the triumphant song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution echoes, I have re-studied Chairman Mao's important document. Reflecting on historical experience and looking forward to a brilliant future, my love for the great helmsman Chairman Mao has been further ignited, and I am filled with the fighting spirit to follow Chairman Mao bravely forward. As a new year approaches, I sincerely wish the great teacher Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Twenty years ago, under the brilliant leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation War traversed a tortuous path and achieved great victory. The three great mountains that had long oppressed the Chinese people were about to be completely overthrown, and the prospect of winning nationwide victory inspired hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians to press forward. However, the domestic and foreign class enemies were unwilling to accept their doom. The reactionary forces of the American and Kuomintang regimes, on the one hand, organized the remaining military forces to continue their stubborn resistance; on the other hand, seeing that they could not save themselves through military struggle alone, they increasingly focused on political struggle, plotting "peaceful" conspiracies. They attempted to use both revolutionary and counter-revolutionary methods to gain time to heal their wounds, and then, in one morning, pounce and strangle the revolution, plunging the nation back into darkness. It was at this critical moment that the great helmsman Chairman Mao issued the great order to "carry the revolution through to the end," pointing out that we must "use revolutionary methods to resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly eliminate all reactionary forces" and "establish a people's democratic republic led by the proletariat and based on the alliance of workers and peasants throughout the country." Under Chairman Mao's guidance, the people of the entire nation saw through the plots and tricks of the American and Kuomintang reactionaries, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raised high the banner of "carrying the revolution through to the end," bravely advancing forward. "Millions of heroes crossed the Yangtze," "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling mats," burying the Chiang Kai-shek regime and breaking through the imperialist line in the East. On October 1, 1949, the great People's Republic of China was born. This was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

"Revolution is the locomotive of history." At critical junctures of the revolution, the true colors of revisionists are most easily exposed. The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, who had long hidden within the party, was an imperialist, Kuomintang reactionary, and a lackey of the big bourgeoisie. From the beginning of the War of Liberation, he opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of "mobilizing the masses, strengthening the people's forces, and, under the leadership of our party, defeating the invaders and building a new China," advocating a so-called "peaceful democratic new stage," attempting to disintegrate the People's Liberation Army and keep China as a colony of the American imperialists under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. However, under Chairman Mao's guidance, the Chinese people were fearless of threats and unyielding to temptations, waging a great War of Liberation and shattering Liu Shaoqi's capitulationist line. The People's Liberation Army quickly shifted from defense to counterattack, and the American and Kuomintang reactionaries quickly shifted from attack to retreat, suffering one defeat after another. The iron fists of the people struck the American and Kuomintang reactionaries, and the pain was felt by the lackey Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi's treacherous heart did not die. As the War of Liberation was about to achieve nationwide victory, he once again jumped out to oppose the Chinese people's carrying the revolution through to the end. At the same time Chairman Mao wrote "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," Liu Shaoqi shouted, "The revolution is developing too fast," "Now it is not a matter of being too slow, but of being too fast. Too fast, there are many difficulties for us." Liu Shaoqi's wolfish ambition was to collaborate internally with American imperialism and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to obstruct the complete liberation of the Chinese people, "striving to stop the revolution here." However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "Opportunists who attempt to block the tide, though they exist almost everywhere, cannot stop the tide. Socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, casting all obstacles behind."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, and exposing Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places. The communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee solemnly announced: The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi was permanently expelled from the party and stripped of all his positions within and outside the party. Liu Shaoqi, the criminal lackey of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, was thrown into the dustbin of history. History has proven: Anyone who dares to obstruct the wheels of history will be crushed to pieces.

Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rapidly advancing, entering the new stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. It is certain that we will achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the closer we get to victory, the more we must remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "carry the revolution through to the end." Twenty years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The enemy will not disappear on its own." "They will use various methods: open and secret, direct and indirect," "to destroy revolutionary forces and preserve reactionary forces." Now, Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices have fallen, but we must fully recognize that the more severely the class enemies are defeated, the more they will struggle desperately; the more isolated the class enemies are, the more concealed and cunning their counter-revolutionary methods will be, even pretending to be pitiful to lull the revolutionary people into complacency. Of course, the more thoroughly the class enemies perform, the faster and more complete their doom will be. The fate of the Kuomintang reactionaries and Liu Shaoqi fully proves this.

The closer the revolution is to victory, the more some weak-willed elements within the revolutionary ranks may become complacent. Chairman Mao warns us: "Because of victory, arrogance within the party, the attitude of considering oneself a hero, the attitude of stopping and not seeking progress, the attitude of seeking pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." Chairman Mao's great teaching has special significance for us in carrying out the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must carry forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and maintain the spirit of hard struggle. We are proletarian revolutionary fighters, with a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. The victories we have achieved so far are only the first step of the Long March. Therefore, in the revolutionary struggle, no matter how great the achievements, we must not be arrogant; no matter how great the revolutionary victories, we must not stop; no matter what time, we must not seek pleasure. On the contrary, the more praise we receive, the more humble and prudent we must be; the closer the revolution is to victory, the more we must press forward; the better the living conditions, the more we must struggle hard; the closer the class enemies are to annihilation, the more actively we must take the initiative to attack.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly lectured, repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture to a few people, it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." The most fundamental experience of the Chinese revolution is: "Sailing the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." All the victories of our country's revolution in the past were achieved through Mao Zedong Thought. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we were able to thoroughly smash Liu Shaoqi and his bourgeois headquarters, suppress the "February Countercurrent" and the evil wind of rehabilitating the "February Countercurrent," and shatter the class enemies' various political and economic means of sabotage from the right or the extreme "left," achieving one victory after another. All these were achieved under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, in a thousand ways and ten thousand ways, the most fundamental way is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. "Now the enemy is completely isolated. However, the enemy's isolation does not mean our victory. If we make mistakes in our policies, we still cannot achieve victory." As long as we closely follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely carry out the various policies of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and use the great Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding, steps, and actions, we will be able to achieve the final victory. I will definitely, in the struggle between the two lines and in the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continuously raise my awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, continuously transform my thoughts, establish a proletarian worldview of continuous and thorough revolution, and forever follow Chairman Mao, revolution to the end, resolute and unyielding.
