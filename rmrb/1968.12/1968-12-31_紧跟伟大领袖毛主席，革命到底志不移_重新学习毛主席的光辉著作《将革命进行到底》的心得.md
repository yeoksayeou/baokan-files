The revolutionary tide surges forward; the wheels of history roll on. The great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" has been published for twenty years. Today, as the working class takes the stage in the superstructure to lead the masses of revolutionary people nationwide in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and as the triumphant song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution echoes, I have re-studied Chairman Mao's important document. Reflecting on historical experience and looking forward to a brilliant future, my love for the great helmsman Chairman Mao has been further ignited, and I am filled with the fighting spirit to follow Chairman Mao bravely forward. As a new year approaches, I sincerely wish the great teacher Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Twenty years ago, under the brilliant leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation War traversed a tortuous path and achieved great victory. The three great mountains that had long oppressed the Chinese people were about to be completely overthrown, and the prospect of winning nationwide victory inspired hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians to press forward. However, the domestic and foreign class enemies were unwilling to accept their doom. The reactionary forces of the American and Kuomintang regimes, on the one hand, organized the remaining military forces to continue their stubborn resistance; on the other hand, seeing that they could not save themselves through military struggle alone, they increasingly focused on political struggle, plotting "peaceful" conspiracies. They attempted to use both revolutionary and counter-revolutionary methods to gain time to heal their wounds, and then, in one morning, pounce and strangle the revolution, plunging the nation back into darkness. It was at this critical moment that the great helmsman Chairman Mao issued the great order to "carry the revolution through to the end," pointing out that we must "use revolutionary methods to resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly eliminate all reactionary forces" and "establish a people's democratic republic led by the proletariat and based on the alliance of workers and peasants throughout the country." Under Chairman Mao's guidance, the people of the entire nation saw through the plots and tricks of the American and Kuomintang reactionaries, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raised high the banner of "carrying the revolution through to the end," bravely advancing forward. "Millions of heroes crossed the Yangtze," "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling mats," burying the Chiang Kai-shek regime and breaking through the imperialist line in the East. On October 1, 1949, the great People's Republic of China was born. This was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

"Revolution is the locomotive of history." At critical junctures of the revolution, the true colors of revisionists are most easily exposed. The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, who had long hidden within the party, was an imperialist, Kuomintang reactionary, and a lackey of the big bourgeoisie. From the beginning of the War of Liberation, he opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of "mobilizing the masses, strengthening the people's forces, and, under the leadership of our party, defeating the invaders and building a new China," advocating a so-called "peaceful democratic new stage," attempting to disintegrate the People's Liberation Army and keep China as a colony of the American imperialists under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. However, under Chairman Mao's guidance, the Chinese people were fearless of threats and unyielding to temptations, waging a great War of Liberation and shattering Liu Shaoqi's capitulationist line. The People's Liberation Army quickly shifted from defense to counterattack, and the American and Kuomintang reactionaries quickly shifted from attack to retreat, suffering one defeat after another. The iron fists of the people struck the American and Kuomintang reactionaries, and the pain was felt by the lackey Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi's treacherous heart did not die. As the War of Liberation was about to achieve nationwide victory, he once again jumped out to oppose the Chinese people's carrying the revolution through to the end. At the same time Chairman Mao wrote "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," Liu Shaoqi shouted, "The revolution is developing too fast," "Now it is not a matter of being too slow, but of being too fast. Too fast, there are many difficulties for us." Liu Shaoqi's wolfish ambition was to collaborate internally with American imperialism and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to obstruct the complete liberation of the Chinese people, "striving to stop the revolution here." However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "Opportunists who attempt to block the tide, though they exist almost everywhere, cannot stop the tide. Socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, casting all obstacles behind."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, and exposing Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places. The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee solemnly announced: The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi was permanently expelled from the party and stripped of all his positions within and outside the party. Liu Shaoqi, the criminal lackey of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, was thrown into the dustbin of history. History has proven: Anyone who dares to obstruct the wheels of history will be crushed to pieces.

Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rapidly advancing, entering the new stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. It is certain that we will achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the closer we get to victory, the more we must remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "carry the revolution through to the end." Twenty years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The enemy will not disappear on its own." "They will use various methods: open and secret, direct and indirect," "to destroy revolutionary forces and preserve reactionary forces." Now, Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices have fallen, but we must fully recognize that the more severely the class enemies are defeated, the more they will struggle desperately; the more isolated the class enemies are, the more concealed and cunning their counter-revolutionary methods will be, even pretending to be pitiful to lull the revolutionary people into complacency. Of course, the more thoroughly the class enemies perform, the faster and more complete their doom will be. The fate of the Kuomintang reactionaries and Liu Shaoqi fully proves this.

The closer the revolution is to victory, the more some weak-willed elements within the revolutionary ranks may become complacent. Chairman Mao warns us: "Because of victory, arrogance within the party, the attitude of considering oneself a hero, the attitude of stopping and not seeking progress, the attitude of seeking pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." Chairman Mao's great teaching has special significance for us in carrying out the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must carry forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and maintain the spirit of hard struggle. We are proletarian revolutionary fighters, with a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. The victories we have achieved so far are only the first step of the Long March. Therefore, in the revolutionary struggle, no matter how great the achievements, we must not be arrogant; no matter how great the revolutionary victories, we must not stop; no matter what time, we must not seek pleasure. On the contrary, the more praise we receive, the more humble and prudent we must be; the closer the revolution is to victory, the more we must press forward; the better the living conditions, the more we must struggle hard; the closer the class enemies are to annihilation, the more actively we must take the initiative to attack.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly lectured, repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture to a few people, it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." The most fundamental experience of the Chinese revolution is: "Sailing the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." All the victories of our country's revolution in the past were achieved through Mao Zedong Thought. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we were able to thoroughly smash Liu Shaoqi and his bourgeois headquarters, suppress the "February Countercurrent" and the evil wind of rehabilitating the "February Countercurrent," and shatter the class enemies' various political and economic means of sabotage from the right or the extreme "left," achieving one victory after another. All these were achieved under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, in a thousand ways and ten thousand ways, the most fundamental way is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. "Now the enemy is completely isolated. However, the enemy's isolation does not mean our victory. If we make mistakes in our policies, we still cannot achieve victory." As long as we closely follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely carry out the various policies of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and use the great Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding, steps, and actions, we will be able to achieve the final victory. I will definitely, in the struggle between the two lines and in the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continuously raise my awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, continuously transform my thoughts, establish a proletarian worldview of continuous and thorough revolution, and forever follow Chairman Mao, revolution to the end, resolute and unyielding.

    紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，革命到底志不移
    ——重新学习毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》的心得
    廖初江
    革命的潮流，汹涌澎湃；历史的车轮，滚滚向前。伟大领袖毛主席《将革命进行到底》这篇光辉著作，已经发表二十周年了。今天，在工人阶级登上上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改政治舞台，领导全国亿万革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我重新学习了毛主席这篇重要的文献。回顾历史的经验，展望灿烂的前景，更加激发了我对伟大统帅毛主席的无限热爱，充满了紧跟毛主席奋勇前进的战斗豪情。在新的一年到来的时候，我最衷心地祝愿伟大导师毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    二十年前，在伟大统帅毛主席的天才指挥下，中国人民解放战争走过了曲折的道路，取得了伟大胜利。长期压在中国人民头上的三座大山，就要被彻底推翻，夺取全国胜利的前景，正鼓舞着亿万军民乘胜前进。但是，国内外阶级敌人不甘心他们的死亡。美蒋反动派，一方面，组织残余军事势力继续顽抗；另一方面，看到单独用军事斗争的方法无法挽救他们的灭亡，就日益重视用政治斗争的方法，大搞
  “和平”阴谋。妄图用反革命的两手，赢得养好创伤的机会，然后在一个早上猛扑过来，将革命扼死，使全国回到黑暗世界。正是在这个关键时刻，伟大的统帅毛主席，向我们发出了“将革命进行到底”的伟大号令，指出要“用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力”，“在全国范围内建立无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为主体的人民民主专政的共和国。”全国人民在毛主席的教导下，识破了美蒋反动派的阴谋诡计，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，高举“将革命进行到底”的旗帜奋勇前进，“百万雄师过大江”，“横扫千军如卷席”，埋葬了蒋家王朝，冲破了帝国主义在东方的战线，在一九四九年十月一日，诞生了伟大的中华人民共和国。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
      “革命是历史的火车头”。革命的转折关头，也最能识别修正主义者的真面目。长期隐藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇这个帝国主义、国民党反动派、大资产阶级的奴才，从解放战争一开始，就跳出来反对毛主席提出的“放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我们党的领导下，打败侵略者，建设新中国”的无产阶级革命路线，鼓吹什么“和平民主新阶段”，妄图瓦解人民解放军，使中国继续成为蒋介石统治的美帝国主义的殖民地。但是，在毛主席教育下的中国人民，不怕威胁，不受诱骗，进行了伟大的解放战争，粉碎了刘少奇的投降主义路线。人民解放军很快由防御转为反攻，美蒋反动派很快由进攻变为退却，节节败退。人民的铁拳打在美蒋反动派的身上，痛在奴才刘少奇的心上。刘少奇贼心不死，在解放战争即将取得全国胜利的时候，再一次跳出来反对中国人民将革命进行到底。在毛主席写《将革命进行到底》的同时，刘少奇则拚命叫喊：“革命发展太快”了，“现在不是怕太慢了，而是怕太快了。太快，对我们的困难很多”。刘少奇的狼子野心，就是要从内部配合美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国贼，阻止中国人民的彻底解放，“极力使革命就此止步”。但是，正如毛主席指出的：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万军民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，揪出了刘少奇及其在各地的代理人。党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报庄严宣布：把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务。刘少奇这个罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，被抛进了历史的垃圾堆。历史雄辩地证明：谁妄想阻挡历史车轮的前进，谁就要被轧得粉身碎骨。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命正在迅猛地向前发展，进入了斗、批、改的新阶段，我们将夺得无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，是肯定无疑的了。但是，越是接近胜利，我们就越要牢记毛主席“将革命进行到底”的教导。毛主席在二十年前就指出：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”“他们将要用各种方法：公开的和秘密的，直接的和迂回的”，“力图破坏革命势力而保存反动势力。”现在，刘少奇及其同伙垮台了，但是我们一定要充分认识到：阶级敌人失败得越惨，就越要作垂死挣扎；阶级敌人越孤立，反革命的手段就越隐蔽，越狡猾，甚至装作可怜的样子，以麻痹革命人民的斗志。当然，阶级敌人表演得越充分，也就灭亡得越迅速，越彻底。国民党反动派和刘少奇的下场，都充分证明了这一点。
    革命越是接近胜利，革命队伍里的一部分意志薄弱者也越容易产生松劲情绪。毛主席告诫我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”毛主席这一伟大教导，对于我们现在进行斗、批、改的伟大历史任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，具有特别重要的意义。我们一定要发扬不断革命、彻底革命的精神，保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，保持艰苦奋斗的作风。我们是无产阶级革命战士，任重而道远，现在取得的胜利，只是万里长征走完了第一步。因此，在革命斗争中，不论有多大成绩，也不能骄傲；不论革命取得多大胜利，也不能停顿；不论什么时候，也不能贪图享乐。相反，受到赞扬越多，越要谦虚谨慎；革命越是接近胜利，越要乘胜前进；生活条件越好，越要艰苦奋斗；阶级敌人越接近灭亡，我们越要积极主动进攻。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”中国革命的历史经验，最根本的一条就是：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”过去我国革命的一切胜利都是靠了毛泽东思想。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们能够把刘少奇及其资产阶级司令部彻底摧毁，能够击溃“二月逆流”和为
  “二月逆流”翻案的邪风，能够粉碎阶级敌人用政治的、经济的各种手段，从右的方面或者从极“左”的方面的破坏，取得一个又一个胜利，都是在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导下取得的。我们要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，千条万条，最根本的一条就是用毛泽东思想统帅一切。“现在敌人已经彻底孤立了。但是，敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”我们只要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项政策，用伟大的毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，就能取得最后胜利。我一定要在两条路线斗争中，在斗、批、改高潮中，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，不断改造自己的思想，树立不断革命、彻底革命的无产阶级世界观，永远紧跟毛主席，革命到底志不移。
