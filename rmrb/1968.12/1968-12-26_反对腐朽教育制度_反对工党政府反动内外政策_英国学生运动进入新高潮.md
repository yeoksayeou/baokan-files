In 1968, amidst the unprecedented surge in student movements in the United States and the raging student struggles in France and Italy and other Western European countries, the broad masses of young students in Britain, long shackled by the heavy spiritual fetters of the old British imperialism, have risen up to break the dead political atmosphere on campuses and launched a wave of struggles against the decayed educational system, for democratic rights, and against the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the Labour Government.

Since the beginning of 1968, student struggles have continuously erupted in various parts of Britain. By May, when the massive student struggle in France broke out, the student movement in Britain also reached its peak. Students in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Bristol, Brighton, and Hull, as well as many students from the bourgeois "highest institutions of learning" such as Oxford and Cambridge, actively joined the struggle. Other higher education institutions, such as the University of Sussex, the University of Essex, and the University of Kiel, have also seen continuous student struggles this year. Many students in higher education institutions have broken out of the previous framework of merely holding "sit-ins" and demonstrations. They have risen up to occupy schools and organize themselves to manage them. For example, students from Hornsey College of Art in North London occupied the entire college from late May to mid-July and managed the college themselves for over forty days until the end of the term.

In the struggle, young students have shown a tenacious and brave spirit, fearless of violence. Students at Oxford University, defying the school's ban, distributed political propaganda materials to workers at the British Leyland Motor Company. Later, they stormed the university's administrative offices, surrounded the school's spy who was specifically monitoring students, and engaged in a face-to-face struggle with him. They also bravely fought against the police sent by the school authorities to suppress them. Their struggle finally forced the reactionary school authorities to lift the ban on distributing political propaganda materials.

In the struggle, many students have begun to pay attention to uniting with workers. They have repeatedly taken to the streets with workers to demonstrate against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and to protest against the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the British Labour Government. Together with workers, they have engaged in fierce battles with the police sent by the authorities to suppress the demonstrators. In the struggle, many students carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao," held up portraits of Mao Zedong, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They also wrote in large, red banners: "U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!" Some university students hung portraits of Mao Zedong and quotations from Chairman Mao around the venue of their struggle with the reactionary school heads.

The surge in the British student movement is a manifestation of the sharpening contradictions between the British monopoly bourgeoisie and the broad masses of the people. In the current situation where Britain's financial and economic crisis is becoming increasingly severe, a large number of young people forced to leave school cannot find jobs and wander around the doors of employment agencies all day. All this has inevitably aroused the angry resistance of the broad masses of young students in Britain.

The British student struggles have made the British rulers deeply uneasy. The mouthpiece of monopoly capital, "The Times," recently revealed this sentiment in an editorial, stating that the current "restlessness" among British students is only "a manifestation of the overall unrest in society." What the British rulers are worried about is that the student struggles, when merged with the struggles of the working class and the broad masses of the people, will more fiercely impact the reactionary rule of the British monopoly bourgeoisie, which is mired in political and economic crises, thereby accelerating the demise of the decrepit British imperialism.

    反对腐朽教育制度　反对工党政府反动内外政策
    英国学生运动进入新高潮
    学生突破过去“静坐”示威框框奋起占领学校　许多学生开始注意同工人相结合和工人并肩战斗
    据新华社伦敦二十五日电　在美国学生运动空前高涨、法国和意大利等西欧大陆国家的学生运动势如燎原烈火的一九六八年里，长年受到老牌英帝国主义的沉重精神枷锁束缚的英国广大青年学生，纷纷起来打破校园中死寂的政治空气，掀起反对腐朽的教育制度、争取民主权利、反对工党政府反动的内外政策的斗争浪潮。
    从一九六八年年初开始，英国各地就不断爆发学生斗争。到五月间声势浩大的法国学生斗争爆发后，英国学生的斗争也进入了高潮。伦敦、伯明翰、利物浦、布利斯托尔、布赖顿和赫尔等地的大学生纷纷投入斗争，牛津、剑桥这些资产阶级“最高学府”的许多学生，也积极行动起来。其他一些高等学校，如苏塞克斯大学、艾赛克斯大学和基尔大学等，今年以来也不断爆发学生斗争。不少高等院校的学生突破了过去单纯举行“静坐”示威的框框，他们奋起占领学校，自己组织起来进行管理。例如，伦敦北区的霍恩西文学院的学生从五月底到七月中占领整个学院，并且自己管理学院达四十多天，直到学期结束。
    在斗争中，青年学生们发扬了顽强勇敢、不畏强暴的精神。牛津大学的学生不顾校方的禁令，把政治性宣传品散发给英国雷兰德汽车公司的工人。后来，他们又冲进大学的行政办公处，把专门监视学生的学监围困起来，同他进行面对面的斗争，并且同校方召来镇压他们的警察英勇搏斗。他们的斗争终于迫使反动学校当局取消不许散发政治性宣传品的禁令。
    在斗争中，许多学生已经开始注意同工人相结合，他们多次同工人并肩走上街头，示威抗议美帝国主义侵略越南，抗议英国工党政府反动的内外政策。他们和工人一起，同当局派去镇压示威群众的警察展开激烈的搏斗。在斗争中许多学生都带着《毛主席语录》，举着毛主席的画像，高呼：
  “毛主席万岁！”他们还在巨大的红色横幅上醒目地写道：“美帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎！”有些大学的学生在同反动学校头目说理斗争的会场周围挂上了毛主席的画像和毛主席语录。
    英国学生运动的高涨，是英国垄断资产阶级和广大人民群众的矛盾激化的一种表现。在当前英国财政经济危机越来越深重的情况下，又有大批被迫离开学校的青少年找不到职业，整天徘徊在职业介绍所门前。这一切不可避免地引起了英国广大青年学生的愤怒反抗。
    英国学生的斗争使得英国统治者深感不安。垄断资本的喉舌《泰晤士报》流露出这种情绪，它最近在一篇社论中说，目前英国学生中的“动荡不安”只是“整个社会动荡不安的一种表现”。英国统治者担心的是：学生斗争同工人阶级和广大人民群众的斗争汇合在一起，将更加猛烈地冲击深陷在政治、经济危机中的英国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，从而加速老朽的英帝国主义的灭亡。
