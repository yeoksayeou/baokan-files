All primary and secondary schools in the city should be placed under the jurisdiction of the municipal revolutionary committee based on the distribution and size of factories and schools. They should be assigned to specific factories and schools, integrating schools into the factory's planning as a grassroots unit directly led by the factory revolutionary committee.

The school's leadership team should consist of outstanding worker representatives sent by the factory, along with PLA members and active elements within the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. In this revolutionary tripartite alliance, workers and PLA members must constitute more than half. This ensures organizational guarantees for the working class's leadership advantage in schools. During their assignment in schools, workers should return to the workshop for one day of labor per week to maintain their working-class identity and ensure that the school is transformed with a working-class appearance.

    必须树立工人阶级的领导优势
    城市所有小学、中学，应由市革命委员会根据工厂、学校分布情况和规模大小，实行定厂、定校，把学校纳入工厂的规划，做为一个基层单位，直接由厂革委会领导。
    学校的领导班子，应由工厂派出的优秀工人代表，同解放军和学校中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，实行革命的三结合。工人、解放军成员在三结合中，必须占半数以上，这样就从组织上保证了工人阶级对学校的领导优势。工人在学校执行任务期间，每周应回车间劳动一天，以保持劳动本色，保证用工人阶级的面貌改造学校。
