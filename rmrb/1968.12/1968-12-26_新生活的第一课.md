	It was already late at night. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Liu Gou Brigade in Shi Zi Commune under the Six Banner Mountains in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region had been busy all day to welcome 67 knowledge youth from Hangzhou who had come to settle down in the countryside. They kept asking, "What is lacking? What is missing?" These young people, who had just left school, thought for a moment and said in unison, "What we lack most is class education. We urgently need the poor and lower-middle peasants to tell us about the village history and family history." The poor and lower-middle peasants agreed to their request with satisfaction.

	The next day, Kong Xiangdong, deputy head of the brigade revolutionary leading group, and old poor peasant Kong Jiku led the new community members out of the village. Upon reaching the halfway up the mountain, Kong Xiangdong pulled out a bitter herb and asked, "Do you know what this is?" The new community members shook their heads, "We don't know." Kong Xiangdong said, "This is called bitter herb." These new community members, who had grown up by the West Lake, saw the bitter herb for the first time today and found it very novel. Each of them pulled out a bitter herb and chewed it. Instantly, a bitter juice flowed from their mouths to their hearts. Kong Xiangdong looked at everyone and said solemnly, "Although this bitter herb is bitter from leaf to root, it saved the lives of our poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society!" Then, he sadly recounted the bitter history of the poor and lower-middle peasants in Liu Gou: "In 1929, Liu Gou, like other villages, suffered from a drought. The heartless landlords and rich peasants squeezed oil from the bones of the poor and lower-middle peasants. For every shi of grain borrowed, three shi had to be repaid after a month. The running dogs collecting rent and taxes drove the poor and lower-middle peasants to despair. Some sold their children, some fled to escape the famine, and many starved to death on the road. It was thanks to this bitter herb that a part of the poor and lower-middle peasants were saved." Finally, he said earnestly, "We must never forget those who dug the wells for us to have water. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Liu Gou Brigade, having been liberated, will never forget Chairman Mao. Now that we have a good life, we still eat bitter herb a few times a year, generation after generation, remembering our roots and forever following Chairman Mao!"

	The new community members observed all this and took it to heart. To be like the poor and lower-middle peasants of Liu Gou, to never forget class bitterness, to remember blood debts, to love the new society deeply, and to be loyal to Chairman Mao, they each pulled out a handful of bitter herb and ate their first "bitter meal."

专栏：知识青年在农村

    新生活的第一课
    天已经很晚了，宁夏回族自治区六盘山下的什字公社刘沟大队贫下中农，为迎接杭州市六十七名插队落户的知识青年忙碌了一天以后，还在不住地问：“缺什么？少什么？”这些刚刚离开学校的青年想了想，不约而同地说：“我们最缺少的是阶级教育，我们迫切需要贫下中农给我们讲一讲村史和家史。”贫下中农满意地答应了他们的要求。
    第二天，大队革命领导小组副组长孔祥栋和老贫农孔几库领着新社员往村外走。到半山坡，孔祥栋拔起一棵苦苦菜，问大家：“你们知道这是啥？”新社员摇摇头：“不知道”。孔祥栋说：“这叫苦苦菜。”这些在西湖畔长大的新社员，今天第一次看到苦苦菜，都觉得很新鲜，每个人拔起一棵放到嘴里嚼起来。顿时，一股苦汁从嘴边流到心头。孔祥栋望望大家，严肃地说：“别看这苦苦菜从叶苦到根，可它在旧社会救过咱贫下中农的命！”接着，他悲痛地讲起了刘沟贫下中农的苦难史：“一九二九年，刘沟和其他村子一样，遭受了旱灾。狠心的地主、富农，趁机在贫下中农骨头里榨油。借一斗粮，过一个月就得还三斗。狗腿子收款要租，逼得贫下中农走投无路。有的卖儿卖女，有的外出逃荒，许多人饿死在路上。靠着这苦苦菜，才救下了一部分贫下中农的命。”最后，他语重心长地说：“吃水不忘挖井人。我们刘沟大队的贫下中农，翻身不忘毛主席。现在过上了好日子，我们每年还是要吃几次苦苦菜，世世代代不忘本，永远紧跟毛主席！”
    新社员把这一切都看在眼里，记在心里。为了象刘沟贫下中农一样，不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，无比热爱新社会，无限忠于毛主席，他们每人拔了一把苦苦菜，吃了第一顿“忆苦饭”。
