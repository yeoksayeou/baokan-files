	About the Discussion on Transferring Public Primary Schools to Production Brigades (Part Nine)
	Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Have Full Confidence and Ability to Run Schools Well

	We poor and lower-middle peasants have followed the brilliant "May 7th Directive" of our great leader Chairman Mao, and established a school. Two years of practice have proven that:

	Production Brigades Can Certainly Run Schools Well

	On August 1, 1966, the *People's Daily* published the brilliant "May 7th Directive" of our great leader Chairman Mao. We in the brigade were greatly inspired. That very evening, we held a meeting of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants and decided to establish a school. Two years of practice have proven that we poor and lower-middle peasants can certainly run schools well. We fully support the good suggestions of comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu.

	At the beginning, there were no school buildings, no desks and chairs, no funds, and no textbooks. The brigade allocated five mu of wasteland, four handcarts, and a patch of barren "yellow mud hill" to the school. The poor and lower-middle peasants provided six essentials for their children's schooling: a book bag (containing the *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, self-compiled political textbooks, and notebooks), a Chairman Mao quotation board, a small stool, a sewing kit, a rain hat, and a hoe. The teachers and students of this school would carry Chairman Mao's portrait high, the school flag of the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University," and the "six essentials" to the "yellow mud hill" to clear the land. When it was time for class, they would prop up a rubber-tired cart, support it with a hoe, hang Chairman Mao's portrait above, hang a couplet on either side reading "Where there is labor, there is learning," and hang a small blackboard in the middle. The students would sit on small stools with their quotation boards on their knees, and the teachers and students would study together. When it was time for labor, they would pick up their hoes and work. They would study, labor, and build the school all at the same time. In just over four months, these students, whom bourgeois intellectuals sneered at as "a bunch of yellow-haired kids who can't accomplish anything," built twelve rooms and thirty-five desks on this desolate "yellow mud hill" without spending a single cent of the state's money. Now, the school has fifteen mu of farmland, one mu of fish pond, a weather station, and livestock including cows, pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese. They have also accumulated several hundred yuan in public funds, achieving self-sufficiency in one-third of their grain, more than enough vegetables, funds, and cooking oil.

	Our brigade's school has always prioritized class education as a key subject. The poor and lower-middle peasants often use their own blood and tears to educate the students on class struggle. The responsible comrades of the brigade party branch personally teach the students about the village's history and organize deeply aggrieved old poor peasants to come to the school and share their family histories. Old poor peasant Wu Momi recounted to the students how his father was killed by a landlord who forced him to eat dog dung and how his daughter was killed by a Japanese warplane, educating the students to never forget their blood and tears and to become good revolutionary successors. Through frequent, lively political education, the students' class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines have greatly increased. They carry deep proletarian feelings, consciously prioritize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, read the "Three Constantly Read Articles" every day, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism every day, and write notes on studying Chairman Mao's works every day.

	The brigade party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants together organized the brigade's educational revolution small group to lead the school. The school established a seven-person class committee. The class committee relies on the masses to do a good job in ideological and political work. Teachers and students, and students among themselves, widely carry out "one helps one, one pair of reds" activities, often using reporting meetings, democratic meetings, and small rectification movements to link class struggle realities and study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

	The school also guides students to widely participate in social practice activities, attending county, commune, and brigade criticism meetings, struggle meetings, reporting meetings, and bitter struggle meetings. Students also conduct social investigations, focusing on investigating the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in this brigade; the political attitudes of various classes, strata, and types of people in various revolutionary periods; and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives and party policies. They analyze and research the obtained materials using Mao Zedong Thought, draw conclusions, and then prove them in actual struggles. Finally, they compile the materials for their own study or print them as propaganda materials, compile them into performance programs, and educate the masses.

	In August of this year, the first batch of thirty-one students graduated from the school. During the allocation, the commune wanted them, the brigade wanted to keep them, and the production team insisted they stay. The students did not want to go to comfortable places or do easy work; they competed to go to the front lines of production labor. Now, these students have one who has honorably joined the People's Liberation Army, three who have been sent to the commune's worker-peasant Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, four who have stayed in school to be old cadres leading the new, and the rest have all gone to the production teams. In less than four months since leaving school, seven have been evaluated by the brigade as active learners of Mao Zedong Thought, one has been elected by the poor and lower-middle peasants as a team committee member, and many have become accountants, managers, and everyone is a guide for studying Mao Zedong Thought. They are all backbone members of the production team.

### 生产大队完全能够办好学校

    关于公办小学下放到大队来办的讨论（九）
    贫下中农完全有信心有能力办好学校
    我们贫下中农遵照伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，创办了一所学校，两年来的实践证明：
    生产大队完全能够办好学校
    一九六六年八月一日，《人民日报》发表了我们伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，我们大队的贫下中农得到极大鼓舞，当晚，我们召开了贫下中农代表会议，决定创办一所学校。两年来的实践证明，我们贫下中农完全可以办好学校。我们完全支持侯振民、王庆余两同志的好建议。
    开始创办时，一无校舍，二无桌椅，三无经费，四无教材。大队给学校配了五亩烂水田，四部手推车，一片寸草不生的“黄泥墩”。贫下中农给自己子女入学的配备是六件宝：书包（内装《毛主席语录》，自编的政治教材和笔记本）、毛主席语录板、小板凳、针线包、雨帽、锄头。这所学校的师生们，每天高举着毛主席像，扛着“抗大”的校旗，带着“六件宝”，到“黄泥墩”去开荒。上课了，把胶轮车一竖，用锄头一支，正上方挂上毛主席画像，两旁挂上“劳动到哪里，学习到哪里”的对联，中间挂上小黑板，学生坐在小凳上，语录板放在膝盖上，师生就共同学起来。劳动了，拿起锄头就干活。一面学习，一面劳动，一面建校。仅仅四个多月，这些被资产阶级知识分子讥讽为“一群黄毛孩子，干不出什么名堂”的学生，没要国家一分钱，在这荒凉的“黄泥墩”上建起了有十二间房屋、三十五张课桌的校舍。现在，学校有十五亩耕地，一亩鱼塘，一个气象哨，养有牛、猪、鸡、鸭、鹅，还积累了几百元公积金，做到粮食自给三分之一，蔬菜、经费、生油自给有余。
    我们大队办的学校，始终把阶级教育列为重要的课程，贫下中农经常用自己的血泪史对学生进行阶级教育。大队党支部负责同志亲自给学生讲村史，还组织苦大仇深的老贫农到学校讲家史。老贫农吴莫米向学生诉说了父亲被地主活活地用狗粪灌死，女儿被日寇飞机炸死的悲惨遭遇，教育学生千万不要忘记血泪仇，当好革命接班人。通过经常的生动活泼的政治教育，学生的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。他们带着深厚的无产阶级感情，自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位，天天读“老三篇”，天天斗私批修，天天写学习毛主席著作的心得笔记。
    大队党支部与贫下中农一起组织了大队教育革命小组领导学校。学校设立由七人组成的班委会。班委会依靠群众做好思想政治工作。师生之间，学生之间普遍开展“一帮一、一对红”活动，经常运用讲用会、民主会、小整风等形式，联系阶级斗争实际，活学活用毛主席著作。
    学校还引导学生广泛参加社会实践活动，参加县、公社、大队的批判会、斗争会、讲用会、忆苦会。学生还进行社会调查，着重调查了本大队阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的情况；各阶级、各阶层、各种人在各个革命时期的政治态度；毛主席最新指示、党的方针政策贯彻落实情况。把所得的材料，用毛泽东思想进行分析、研究，得出结论，然后再到实际斗争中去加以证明，最后整理成材料，供自己学习，或者印成宣传材料，编成演唱节目，宣传教育群众。
    今年八月，学校第一期三十一个同学毕业了，分配时，公社要、大队留，生产队硬是不让走。学生们不愿去舒服的地方，不愿干轻便的工作，争着要到生产劳动第一线。现在，这些学生有一名光荣地参加了人民解放军，三名选派到公社的工农毛泽东思想宣传队，四名留校当以老带新的骨干，其余全部到生产队。出校不到四个月，就有七人被大队评为学习毛泽东思想积极分子，一名被贫下中农推选为队委，不少人当了记分员、保管员，人人都是学习毛泽东思想辅导员，生产队的骨干。
