The broad masses of emancipated Tibetan farmers in the ancient city of Lhasa on the plateau, with profound proletarian feelings for the People's Liberation Army created by the great leader Chairman Mao, are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," and have launched a massive campaign to support the army.

In recent days, Lhasa has been filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and red flags are flying. The emancipated farmers, carrying large portraits of Chairman Mao, holding up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and bringing the deep affection of the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Tibet for their own sons and daughters in the army, have gone deep into the barracks, stations, and hospitals of various units to express their warm greetings to the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army. On December 10, a grand "Support the Army and Love the People" celebration was held at the Tibet Military Region. Many units held meetings to support the army, joint celebrations between the military and the people, and joint discussions between the military and the people. At these meetings, the emancipated farmers enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army's Tibet units for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and for the immortal merits they have established in the great struggle to defend and build the country's borders since they entered Tibet. They especially praised the contributions made by the People's Liberation Army's Tibet units in the "three supports, two militaries" work and in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of emancipated farmers expressed their determination to learn from the People's Liberation Army, which is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They vowed to cherish the People's Liberation Army as they would their own eyes, to maintain the great iron wall, and to actively and enthusiastically support and assist the People's Liberation Army in doing an even better job in the "three supports, two militaries" work and in carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Many emancipated farmers also made pledges to support the army and sent one letter after another to the broad masses of soldiers and officers. The emancipated farmers also sent their Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the barracks and hospitals of the units to perform artistic programs they had composed themselves, praising the great leader Chairman Mao, praising the revolutionary committees, and praising the People's Liberation Army. These performances were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers and officers.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers stationed in Tibet have expressed their determination to better implement Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," to further improve their work among the people, to strengthen military-civilian unity, to defend the country's borders, and to build Tibet into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.
