Under the heavy blows of the surging revolutionary tide of the peoples of the world and the stormy revolutionary struggle of the American people, the U.S. imperialists, who are in a dilemma both internally and externally and have no way out, are hastening the pace of fascization at home and continuously strengthening the military, prisons, courts, and other state apparatuses in a desperate struggle.

Abandoning the "democracy, freedom" banner
Raising the "law and order" club

In this year's U.S. presidential "election" farce, the Republican and Democratic Parties, which are tools of the U.S. monopolistic bourgeoisie, have more brazenly discarded the so-called "democracy, freedom" banner they have always boasted of and are vying with each other to raise the "law and order" club. This is an important signal of the acceleration of fascization in the U.S. The incoming U.S. President Nixon, in his election campaign, openly declared, "The most important issue at home is the restoration of law and order," and threatened to "bring an entirely new team to the Department of Justice" to launch a "giant nationwide offensive" against what he considers "related to the problem of crime," such as "riots, civil disobedience, and student struggles," and that he himself would "personally take charge and lead." Recently, the notorious director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Hoover, after meeting with Nixon, also menacingly declared, "Justice is subordinate to law and order," and that "strong enforcement of the law" is the "only response" to "riots and lawlessness." The statements of Nixon and Hoover clearly indicate that the U.S. monopolistic bourgeoisie wants to further strengthen its reactionary "law and order" and intensify the suppression of the revolutionary struggles of the American people, first and foremost the armed resistance struggles of African Americans.

Continuously strengthening the repression machine
Increasing the number of military and police personnel

Under the banner of "law and order," the U.S. monopolistic ruling class is continuously strengthening its fascist dictatorship machine. Since this year, the U.S. ruling class has conducted "special training" aimed at suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the people for tens of thousands of "National Guard" and Army Reserve personnel. In large cities such as New York, Chicago, Detroit, and San Francisco, "Gestapo-style" "tactical patrol teams" have been more widely established. This summer, the U.S. Department of Defense formally established a command led by a major general responsible for suppressing so-called "civil unrest." In recent periods, the Central Intelligence Agency and other spy organizations have been busy buying personnel and expanding their spy networks everywhere.

Frequently deploying armed military and police
Bloody suppression of people's struggles

At the same time, in the face of the brave struggles of the American people, the U.S. monopolistic ruling class often deploys tens of thousands of soldiers, "National Guard," and police to carry out large-scale arrests and bloody suppression. According to obviously greatly reduced figures revealed by the U.S. government, in the April high tide of the African American anti-violence struggle this year, in seventy-six cities in the U.S., more than 21,000 African Americans were arrested, and 2,500 were killed or injured. The "National Guard" that was sent to Wilmington, Delaware, to suppress the African American district is still not withdrawn, and this African American district has been under military occupation by the "National Guard" for more than half a year. A regular police officer in New York City once admitted, "Every time I hear they (referring to the tactical patrol teams) are going to be sent to my jurisdiction, I know I will be filling out arrest warrants all night, they arrest anyone." The American bourgeois magazine *Prospect* recently also admitted, without being prompted, that the number of people in U.S. "federal prisons" has increased this year to exceed normal capacity.

Spies rampantly active
Secretly arresting revolutionary people

To suppress the people's struggles, the U.S. ruling class has instructed spies all over the country to rampantly carry out activities. In addition to setting up electronic eavesdropping devices everywhere, the FBI spies also extensively use computers to monitor the speech and actions of the American people. The U.S. spies also make blacklists everywhere, persecute, and secretly arrest revolutionary people in the U.S. Although the U.S. secret police have never dared to publish secret arrest incidents, according to the British Reuters, by the end of last June, the number of Americans arrested by the U.S. secret police on the charge of "threatening the president" reached 425. In addition, it has been revealed that the U.S. monopolistic ruling class has established 39 concentration camps at home, preparing to carry out more large-scale and more brutal suppression of the American people at any time.

Weakness fully exposed
Demise not far off

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on revolutionary people ultimately only promote more extensive and more intense revolutions among the people." The U.S. monopolistic ruling class is accelerating fascization at home and carrying out brutal suppression and mad attacks on the broad masses of people. This is a full exposure of the U.S. imperialists' desperate and weak paper tiger nature as they approach their end, reflecting that the days of the U.S. reactionaries sitting on a volcano are getting worse and worse. The desperate struggles of U.S. imperialism will inevitably promote the revolutionary struggles of the American people to further escalate. This struggle will merge with the anti-U.S. storm of the revolutionary peoples of the world into an irresistible torrent, ultimately burying the fascist rule of the U.S. monopolistic bourgeoisie.

### 在世界人民和美国人民斗争风暴打击下陷于内外交困  美帝加紧国内法西斯化进行垂死挣扎

    在世界人民和美国人民斗争风暴打击下陷于内外交困
    美帝加紧国内法西斯化进行垂死挣扎
    新华社十一日讯　在汹涌澎湃的世界人民革命怒潮和风起云涌的美国人民革命斗争的沉重打击下，陷于内外交困、走投无路的美帝国主义正在国内加紧法西斯化的步伐，不断地强化军队、监狱、法庭等国家机器，妄图进行垂死挣扎。
    抛弃“民主、自由”破旗
    举起“法律和秩序”大棒
    在今年的美国总统“选举”丑剧中，作为美国垄断资产阶级御用工具的共和党和民主党都更加赤裸裸地抛弃了它们一向标榜的所谓“民主、自由”的破旗，而竞相举起“法律和秩序”的大棒。这是美国加速法西斯化的一个重要讯号。即将上台的美国新总统尼克松在竞选活动中露骨地叫嚣，“在国内，最首要的问题是恢复法律和秩序”，扬言“打算把整个一支新的队伍带到司法部去”，对他认为与“犯罪”问题“有关”的“暴动、公民不服从和学生斗争”，“展开巨大的全国性的进攻”，而他自己将“亲自负责并亲自领导”。最近，臭名昭著的美国联邦调查局局长胡佛在会见尼克松之后，也杀气腾腾地叫嚷，“正义是附属于法律和秩序的”，“强烈地执行法律”是对“暴动和无法无天行为”的“唯一回答”。尼克松和胡佛的这些言论清楚地表明美国垄断资产阶级要进一步加强它们的反动的“法律和秩序”，加紧镇压美国人民的革命斗争，首先是加紧镇压美国黑人的武力抗暴斗争。
      不断强化镇压机器
      大量增加军警人员
    在“法律和秩序”的口号下，美国垄断统治集团正在不断强化它的法西斯专政的机器。今年以来，美国统治集团已对几十万“国民警卫队”和陆军预备役人员进行了旨在镇压人民革命斗争的“特别训练”。在纽约、芝加哥、底特律和旧金山等大城市中更普遍地建立了“盖世太保”式的“战术巡逻队”。今年夏天，美国国防部正式设立了一个由一个中将领导的负责镇压所谓“民间骚乱”的指挥部。最近一个时期以来，美国中央情报局等特务组织正在到处收买人员，扩充特务网。
    经常出动武装军警
      血腥镇压人民斗争
    与此同时，在美国人民的英勇斗争面前，美国垄断统治集团动辄出动成千上万名军队、“国民警卫队”和警察，进行大规模的逮捕和血腥的镇压。据美国官方透露的显然大大缩小了的数字，仅今年四月美国黑人抗暴斗争高潮中，在美国七十六个城市里就有两万一千余名黑人被逮捕，二千五百余人被杀害或受伤。当时开到特拉华州威尔明敦市黑人区进行镇压的“国民警卫队”到现在仍未撤走，这个黑人区半年多来一直处在“国民警卫队”的军事占领之下。纽约市的一个普通警察曾经招认，“每当我听说他们（指战术巡逻队）要派到我的辖区里来时，我就知道我将整夜填写逮捕单了，他们是什么人都抓”。美国资产阶级杂志《展望》不久前也不打自供地承认，关在美国“联邦监狱里的人员，今年已增加得超过了正常的容量”。
      特务猖狂进行活动
    秘密逮捕革命人民
    为了镇压人民斗争，美国统治集团指使美国各地的特务猖狂地进行活动。美国联邦调查局的特务除了到处设置电子偷听器外，还大量利用电子计算机来监视美国人民的言论和行动。美国的特务还到处搞黑名单，迫害和秘密逮捕美国的革命人民。尽管美国秘密警察秘密捕人事件从来不敢公布，但是据英国路透社透露，到去年六月底为止的一年中，美国秘密警察以“威胁总统”的一项罪名而逮捕的美国人民就达四百二十五人。此外，据透露，美国垄断统治集团在国内已设立了三十九处集中营，准备随时对美国人民进行更大规模和更残酷的镇压。
    虚弱本质彻底暴露
      最后灭亡为期不远
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”美国垄断统治集团在国内加速法西斯化，对广大人民进行残酷镇压和疯狂进攻，这是美帝国主义日暮途穷、虚弱的纸老虎本质的大暴露，反映了坐在火山口上的美国反动派的日子越来越不好过。美帝国主义进行的这种垂死的挣扎，必将促使美国人民的革命斗争进一步高涨。这一斗争将同世界革命人民的反美风暴汇成不可阻挡的巨流，最终彻底埋葬万恶的美国垄断资产阶级的法西斯统治。
