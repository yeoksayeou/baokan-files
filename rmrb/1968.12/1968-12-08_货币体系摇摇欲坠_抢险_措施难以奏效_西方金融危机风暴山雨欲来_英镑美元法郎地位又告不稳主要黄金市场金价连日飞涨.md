The financial storm that erupted in the capitalist world in November has not yet subsided, and the pound is once again under tremendous pressure, its position once again becoming unstable. At the same time, gold prices continue to rise in the major financial markets of the West, and the dollar and franc are weakening. This shows that the recent "rescue" measures taken by a few major capitalist countries are far from sufficient to cope with the crisis facing the financial and monetary system of the capitalist world. Western bourgeois newspapers and news agencies are concerned that if the current "unstable trend" continues, it could trigger a new financial crisis storm.

The exchange rate of the pound in the London market fell to its lowest level since the November crisis, at less than 2.3825 dollars per pound. The Bank of England had to sell a large amount of dollars to barely maintain the pound's price.

The instability of the pound is the result of the worsening financial and economic situation in Britain against the backdrop of the shaky financial and monetary system of the entire capitalist world. According to official figures, Britain lost 820 million pounds in gold and foreign exchange reserves in November, the highest monthly loss so far this year, bringing Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves to their lowest level since the pound's devaluation in November last year.

The London Financial Times admitted on the 7th that the pound is once again under pressure due to widespread concern about the British economy.

The British ruling class, as usual, attempts to shift financial and economic difficulties onto the working people.

It is reported that the British authorities are about to order a price increase for 440 types of manufactured goods. According to official statistics, prices in Britain have risen by 5% to 6% since the devaluation of the pound; British newspapers estimate that by the end of the year, prices will rise by another 5% or so.

At the same time, gold prices have been rising in major gold markets such as London, Paris, and Zurich over the past few days. On the 4th, the gold price in these places reached its highest level in five months. Officially, each ounce of gold is worth 35 dollars, but it has now risen to 43.32 dollars in Paris and 40.4 dollars in London.

On the other hand, the dollar and franc, like the pound, are also falling in price. Western newspapers anxiously point out that these are ominous signs of a new financial crisis storm.

    货币体系摇摇欲坠  “抢险”措施难以奏效
    西方金融危机风暴山雨欲来
    英镑美元法郎地位又告不稳主要黄金市场金价连日飞涨
    新华社伦敦七日电　资本主义世界十一月间爆发的金融危机新风暴余波未平，英镑再次受到强大压力，地位又告不稳；与此同时，在西方主要金融市场上，黄金价格继续上涨，美元、法郎地位疲软。这说明，几个主要资本主义国家最近采取的一些“抢险”措施，远不足以应付资本主义世界金融货币体系所面临的危局。西方资产阶级报刊通讯社担心，如果目前的这种“不稳定趋势”继续下去，可能触发一场新的金融危机风暴。
    英镑在伦敦市场上的外汇牌价，昨天再次跌到了十一月危机风暴以来的最低水平，即每英镑合二·三八二五美元以下。英格兰银行不得不抛售大量美元以勉强维持英镑价格。
    英镑地位不稳，是在整个资本主义世界金融货币体系摇摇欲坠的背景下，英国财政经济情况继续恶化的结果。据官方发表的数字，英国在十一月份流失的黄金外汇储备达八千二百万英镑，为今年以来每月流失额的最高纪录，使英国的黄金外汇储备下降到去年十一月英镑贬值以来的最低水平。
    七日的伦敦《金融时报》承认，英镑再次受到压力，是由于人们“对英国的经济普遍感到担心”。
    英国统治集团照例企图把财经困难转嫁给劳动人民。
    据报道，英国当局即将下令提高四百四十一种制成品的价格。根据官方的统计数字，从英镑贬值以来，英国的物价已经上涨百分之五到百分之六；英国报刊估计，到年底，物价还将上涨百分之五左右。
    与此同时，连日来，伦敦、巴黎、苏黎世等主要黄金市场上金价上涨，四日，这些地方的金价都涨到了五个月来的最高峰。按官价，每盎司黄金值三十五美元，但是，目前在巴黎已涨到四十三·三二美元，在伦敦为四十·四美元。
    另一方面，美元、法郎同英镑一样价格下跌。西方报刊不安地指出，这些都是引起一场新的金融危机风暴的不祥之兆。
