BEIJING, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Oriental News Agency, the U.S. imperialist nuclear submarine "Triton" entered Sasebo Port this morning, immediately facing strong opposition from patriotic workers, students, and citizens of Japan.

In the face of the massive anti-U.S. movement launched by the Japanese people, the U.S. nuclear submarines have not dared to enter Japanese ports for seven months. Shortly after reorganizing his reactionary cabinet, Sato Eisaku, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, allowed the U.S. nuclear submarine to enter Sasebo Port. This further exposed his despicable role as a lackey of U.S. imperialism.

Including students from Kyushu University, about 800 students from various parts of western Japan started marching in Sasebo City early in the morning, holding a grand demonstration to protest the entry of the U.S. nuclear submarine "Triton" into Sasebo Port. Before the demonstration, the students also held meetings in the park and in front of the train station in Sasebo City, expressing their determination to carry on the anti-U.S. struggle to the end. A student spoke at the meeting, saying: "The docking of the U.S. nuclear submarine 'Triton' is the most serious provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Japanese people. They intend to further strengthen the military base in Sasebo through this evil act. The Japanese people will never allow the U.S. imperialists and the reactionary Sato government, which follows the U.S., to succeed in their conspiracy. We are determined to unite with the people of Sasebo City and the broad masses of workers and people in various Asian countries to carry on the struggle to smash the U.S. imperialist plan of aggression to the final victory."

The students braved the cold wind and rain, repeatedly demonstrating bravely in the city and around the U.S. military base. They shouted, "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "U.S. nuclear submarines get out!" "U.S. imperialism out of Japan!"

The reactionary Sato government is terrified of the Japanese people's vigorous anti-U.S. struggle, dispatching 5,000 armed police to strictly block all roads leading to the U.S. military base and surrounding the demonstration teams, brutally suppressing the students. However, the Japanese students were not intimidated by the police's savage actions; they persisted in demonstrating with great courage. The people of Sasebo City enthusiastically supported the patriotic actions of the students and strongly condemned the fascist crimes of the reactionary police's unreasonable suppression of the students.

The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Miyamoto Kenji, in collusion with the fascist atrocities of the reactionary Sato government, distributed leaflets, slandering the patriotic actions of students and workers as so-called "violent actions," and shamelessly called on citizens to engage in so-called "legal struggle." The treacherous acts of the Miyamoto group have been strongly condemned by the Japanese people.

Workers and students from Fukuoka Prefecture and neighboring prefectures held meetings and demonstrations, strongly demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. military base in Itazuke.

    “粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“美帝从日本滚出去！”
    日本人民强烈反对美国核潜艇进入佐世保
    西部各地学生在佐世保示威集会决心粉碎美帝的侵略计划
    新华社十八日讯  据东方通讯社报道：在远东进行侵略活动的美帝核潜艇“潜水者号”十八日上午开进佐世保港，立即受到了日本爱国工人、学生和市民的强烈反对。
    在日本人民掀起的声势浩大的反美运动面前，美国的核潜艇已经有七个月不敢开进日本港口。佐藤荣作在他改组反动内阁之后不久又不顾日本人民的强烈反对，让美国核潜艇开进佐世保港，这就更加充分地暴露了他充当美帝走狗的丑恶嘴脸。
    包括九州大学的学生在内的日本西部各地的学生八百人，今天分成几路从清早起就在佐世保市进行浩浩荡荡的游行示威，抗议美国核潜艇“潜水者号”开进佐世保港。在游行示威以前，学生们还分别在佐世保市的公园里和火车站前举行集会，表示决心把反美斗争进行到底。一位学生在集会上讲话说：“美国核潜艇‘潜水者号’的进驻，是美帝对日本人民的最严重挑衅。他们企图通过这一罪恶行动，进一步加强佐世保的军事基地。日本人民决不允许美帝和追随美帝的佐藤反动政府的阴谋得逞。我们决心同佐世保市民团结起来，同亚洲各国的广大工人和人民团结起来，把粉碎美帝侵略计划的斗争进行到最后胜利。”
    学生们冒着寒风暴雨，一次又一次地在市内和美军基地周围勇敢地举行示威游行。他们高呼：“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“美国核潜艇滚回去！”“美帝从日本滚出去！”
    佐藤反动政府对日本人民轰轰烈烈的反美斗争怕得要命，竟然出动五千名武装警察严密地封锁通向美军基地的一切道路，并且包围示威队伍，野蛮地镇压学生。但是，日本学生们没有被警察的野蛮行动所吓倒，他们以大无畏的精神坚持示威游行。佐世保市民热情地支持了爱国学生的正义行动，并愤怒谴责反动警察无理镇压学生的法西斯罪行。
    日共宫本修正主义集团配合佐藤反动政府的法西斯暴行，大肆散发传单，诬蔑学生和工人的爱国行动是所谓“暴力行动”，并无耻地呼吁市民进行所谓“合法斗争”。宫本集团的叛徒行径受到了日本人民的强烈谴责。（附图片）
