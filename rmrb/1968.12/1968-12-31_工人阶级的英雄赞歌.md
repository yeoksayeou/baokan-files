I watched the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern," and it was like attending a living class on revolutionary tradition and class struggle. It deepened my understanding of Chairman Mao's latest directive that "the working class must lead everything."

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the most foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." The towering figures on the stage, the three generations of the Li family, fear no sacrifice, bravely confront danger, and always stand at the forefront of the struggle. They resolutely fight the class enemy to the bitter end, fully demonstrating the noble qualities and heroic spirit of the working class. The outstanding representative of the working class, Li Yuhe, is fearless in the face of a powerful enemy. For the revolution, he stands on the execution ground with a heart for the world, facing death with composure, and sacrifices himself bravely. Li's grandmother faces the enemy's threats and temptations with a stern brow, unyielding in the face of the bloodthirsty executioner. The good offspring of the working class, Li Tie Mei, after the revolutionary predecessors' sacrifice, takes up the red lantern and carries on the revolutionary cause. She vows to "burn down the dark and gloomy sky" and "fight until the wolves are exterminated, never leaving the battlefield." Their heroic spirit of the working class is truly earth-shaking and inspiring!

The more I watched, the more I loved it, and the more I couldn't contain my excitement. I felt that Li Yuhe, Li's grandmother, and Li Tie Mei, these heroic warriors of the Chinese working class, stood tall on the socialist stage, as if they were living in our great era, as if they were fighting alongside us.

I have been promoting Mao Zedong Thought at the Guangzhou Railway Bureau South Station and fighting with the revolutionary railway workers of the 1960s for nearly a year. They are so much like Li Yuhe, Li's grandmother, and Li Tie Mei! For the revolution, they were not intimidated by the white terror created by the class enemy, nor were they bought off by counter-revolutionary economism. They always stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, charging against the arrogant line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. For the revolution, they followed Chairman Mao closely, under the battle command of the proletarian headquarters, unified in thought, step, and action. They exposed the hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. For the revolution, they firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They made the revolution boil with enthusiasm and pushed production forward day by day, achieving new successes in accelerating the socialist construction of our motherland and supporting the world revolution.

In a battle to extinguish a chemical warehouse fire and rescue state property, they feared neither explosions nor poison. While fighting the fire, they loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "With firm resolve, fearing neither sacrifice nor hardship, surmounting every difficulty, and striving for victory." When the frontline comrades fainted, the next ones rushed forward. These heroic warriors of the working class in the 1960s used their lives to protect the people, safeguard state property, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is a heroic ode to the working class that echoes through the clouds. The revolutionary railway workers who participated in this firefighting battle vividly demonstrated the spirit of fearlessness and self-sacrifice of Li Yuhe, Li's grandmother, and Li Tie Mei, fully embodying Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." The struggle over the past year has made me deeply realize that under the leadership of the great teacher Chairman Mao, the working class will definitely lead the people of the entire country. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they will complete the great historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation in all domains of the superstructure, and carry the Cultural Revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end.

We are Chairman Mao's soldiers, the children of the people. We resolutely learn from the working class, like the heroic warriors of the working class Li Yuhe, Li's grandmother, and Li Tie Mei, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to follow Chairman Mao in revolution all our lives, and forever be the strong backbone of the working class!

The red lantern lights the way, and the red light of Mao Zedong Thought shines for all generations. We will definitely follow the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao and march forward forever!

    工人阶级的英雄赞歌
    驻广州铁路局南站毛泽东思想宣传员、五好战士　李基洛
    我观看了革命现代京剧《红灯记》，上了一堂活生生的革命传统和阶级斗争的教育课，对毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示，有了更加深刻的理解。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”高高屹立在舞台上的李玉和一家三代，不怕牺牲，赴汤蹈火，始终站在斗争的最前列，坚决和阶级敌人血战到底，充分显示了工人阶级的高贵品质和英雄气概。工人阶级的优秀代表李玉和在强大的敌人面前，“浑身是胆雄赳赳”。为革命，他身在刑场，心怀天下，视死如归，慷慨就义。李奶奶横眉冷对敌人的威胁利诱，在嗜血成性的刽子手面前，脸不改色，寸步不让。工人阶级的好后代李铁梅，在革命前辈牺牲以后，接过红灯，继承革命事业。她立誓“要把黑地昏天来烧塌”，“打不尽豺狼决不下战场”。他们这种工人阶级的英雄气概，真是惊天动地，气壮山河！
    我越看越爱看，越按捺不住心头的激动。我感到李玉和、李奶奶、李铁梅这些中国工人阶级的英雄战士，巍然屹立在社会主义的舞台上，仿佛就生活在我们这个伟大的时代里，仿佛就和我们战斗在一起。
    我在广州铁路局南站宣传毛泽东思想，和二十世纪六十年代的革命铁路工人共同战斗近一年了，他们多么象李玉和、李奶奶、李铁梅啊！为革命，他们没有被阶级敌人制造的白色恐怖所吓倒，也没有为反革命经济主义所收买，他们始终站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，向着嚣张一时的大叛徒刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线冲杀。为革命，他们紧跟毛主席，在无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，把暗藏的叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子挖了出来。为革命，他们坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，把革命搞得热气腾腾，推动生产日新月异地向前发展，为加速祖国的社会主义建设和支援世界革命立了新功。
    在一次扑灭化学药品仓库火灾、抢救国家财产的战斗中，他们不怕爆炸，不怕剧毒，一面救火，一面高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”前面的同志昏倒了，后面的同志冲上去。这些六十年代工人阶级的英雄战士，用自己的生命保卫了人民群众，保护了国家财产，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。这是一曲响彻云霄的工人阶级的英雄赞歌。参加这次灭火战斗的革命铁路工人，突出地表现了李玉和、李奶奶、李铁梅那种不畏强敌、不怕牺牲的无产阶级革命精神，充分体现了毛主席的伟大教导，“没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”近一年来的斗争实践，使我深刻地体会到：工人阶级在伟大导师毛主席的领导下，一定能够领导全国人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，完成上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的伟大历史使命，把无产阶级专政下的文化大革命进行到底。
    我们是毛主席的战士，是人民的子弟兵。我们坚决向工人阶级学习，象工人阶级的英雄战士李玉和、李奶奶、李铁梅那样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一辈子紧跟毛主席闹革命，永远做工人阶级的坚强后盾！
    红灯照着脚印走，毛泽东思想的红灯光耀万代。我们一定沿着毛主席指引的革命航道永远向前！
