Before dawn, the commune members gradually went to the fields to work. A middle-aged man in his forties, wearing a faded blue cotton jacket, with a towel wrapped around his head, rolled-up trousers, and carrying two large baskets full of manure, sang "Determined to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory," a song of Chairman Mao's quotations, and walked over with vigorous steps. Someone laughed and asked him, "You're carrying manure again!" He replied, "This is the duty of the laboring people, and it will never change in a lifetime!"

This middle-aged man is Comrade Li Zhiyong, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Ji County, Shanxi Province, who was previously the deputy secretary of the county committee. Everyone says, "Our old comrade Li is a good servant of the people."

	Sunny days, a body of dust; rainy days, a body of mud

Comrade Li Zhiyong, born into a poor peasant family, joined the revolution during the Anti-Japanese War. Over the past twenty years, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, he has always maintained the character of a laboring person. Last April, Li Zhiyong was elected as the chairman of the county revolutionary committee. With immense excitement, he wrote in his diary: Dear Chairman Mao! I will forever be loyal to you! I will definitely remember your teachings of "being both an official and a common person," never detaching myself from labor and the masses, never indulging in the bad habits of the exploiting class of being an official and a lord, and forever maintaining the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.

Li Zhiyong works wherever he goes, does whatever work he encounters, and never wastes a moment. In the office, he never misses voluntary labor; in the countryside, wherever there are commune members working, he appears there.

Li Zhiyong is able to frequently participate in labor because he consciously fights against bureaucratism. Once, he went to Liu Gou Brigade to stay for a while and, according to the brigade leader's arrangement, went with some commune members to the sheep pen to carry manure. The sheep pen had many fleas, and after carrying a few loads, his legs were bitten with many bumps. At this moment, a thought flashed through his mind: It's better to put down the basket and go with the others to build the manure pile. As soon as this thought of fearing hardship appeared, he immediately realized it was wrong: "Why are the commune members not afraid of being bitten, but I am? This is bureaucratism at work. Can I withstand the flea bites and persist? This is a big issue of whether I am willing to eliminate bureaucratism. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Cadres should participate in collective production labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism.' I will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings." Thinking of this, Li Zhiyong rolled up his trousers and carried the manure with everyone else.

Li Zhiyong often participates in collective production labor, getting dusty on sunny days and muddy on rainy days. Over time, the masses regard him as a close friend, and they discuss revolutionary and production issues with him, making him understand the mood of the masses and grasp the problems in work, further improving the work of the revolutionary committee. He deeply felt, "Sweat with the masses, talk with the masses, and the heart will be closer to the masses."

	Standing at the forefront, continuously achieving new successes

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Li Zhiyong firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, breaking through the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, resolutely fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. After taking up the position of chairman of the revolutionary committee, he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and firmly stood at the forefront of class struggle, continuously achieving new successes for the people.

In April of this year, after Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were issued, Li Zhiyong immediately went deep into various teams of Chengguan Commune to convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions. He propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions wherever he went, even if he encountered only one person, he would read Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them several times.

Wherever Chairman Mao's voice reached, the broad revolutionary masses followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly uncovering the lid of class struggle, and soon a new high tide of struggle against the enemy surged across the entire county. Comrade Li Zhiyong quickly went deep into the most complex class struggle in Zhongdun Commune to stay for a while, acting both as a fighter and a commander. He organized the masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's policies and quotations on the struggle against the enemy and the correct handling of two types of contradictions, using the party's policies to arm the masses, further isolating and striking a handful of class enemies.

The broad revolutionary masses grasped the party's policies, became clear-eyed, and fought with high morale, digging out traitors, spies, remnants of the Kuomintang, and other counter-revolutionaries one by one. At this time, Li Zhiyong found that in some places, after the class enemies were exposed, they were grabbed, fought, and then neglected, without focusing on criticism, and without closely combining the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness. He then held a revolutionary criticism and learning class in Anping Brigade, helping the masses there to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. Everyone studied one quotation from Chairman Mao, criticized one revisionist point of the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi, deeply touched their souls, and eliminated one stream of poison. Li Zhiyong then helped the revolutionary masses here to summarize the experience of carrying out revolutionary criticism, spreading it across the entire county, and promoting the deep development of revolutionary criticism across the county.

In the practice of class struggle, Li Zhiyong deeply felt that to connect with the masses, one must stand at the forefront of class struggle and fiercely strike the class enemies, protecting the broad masses of the people. He said, "Not grasping class struggle is the biggest detachment from the masses."

	Where there is work, do it there; everywhere, set an example

After taking up the position of county revolutionary committee chairman, Li Zhiyong always insisted on doing work wherever there is work and setting an example everywhere. Over the past year, except for participating in necessary meetings, he never stayed in the office. Wherever he went, he worked there, propagated Mao Zedong Thought there, and conveyed Chairman Mao's voice there. Almost every commune, brigade, and production team in the county had his footprints. He required cadres to work harder and go down to the grassroots, learn, reform, and take root at the grassroots level. He often did investigations and solved problems at the grassroots level, participated in the struggle with the masses, helped the masses to summarize and promote scattered experiences, and better guided the work on the surface. Since last year, he has discovered, summarized, and promoted the experiences of nine points, which have strongly promoted the vigorous development of various works across the county.

Li Zhiyong closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and seriously studied and implemented Chairman Mao's instructions. He demanded strict requirements of himself, and whatever he asked others to do, he did it first. He often set an example with his model actions for the members of the revolutionary committee and other cadres in three aspects: being loyal to Chairman Mao and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments; highlighting proletarian politics and actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought; never detaching from the masses for a moment and wholeheartedly serving the people. He often said that the words and deeds of leading cadres influence the masses at every moment. Whether one's conscious revolutionary spirit is strong or not is related not only to one's own revolutionization but also to the revolutionization of the members of the revolutionary committee, cadres, and masses. If one does not take the lead in learning and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, one has no right to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the broad cadres and revolutionary masses. Therefore, he took the lead in carrying forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, applying Mao Zedong Thought as soon as he learned it, and seeing immediate results.

Once, Li Zhiyong went to Shanyang Brigade. He found that the poor peasant livestock keeper, Old Liu Si, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well. That night, he reviewed Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" under the oil lamp and compared himself with Old Liu Si in studying Chairman Mao's works. He wrote in his learning notes: Poor and lower-middle peasants study Chairman Mao's works most seriously, execute them most resolutely, and implement them most quickly. They are always good examples for me to learn from.

Li Zhiyong listens to Chairman Mao's words and honestly serves as a servant of the people. He does investigations and writes reports without relying on secretaries, always doing it himself. In the office, before and after meals, he helps the cooks carry water and wash dishes. When traveling by train, he helps the train attendants assist the elderly and clean the floor. When staying in a guesthouse, he helps the attendants carry water and sweep the floor. In the countryside, in addition to participating in collective production labor, he often helps the livestock keepers cut grass and clean the pens.

In terms of work style, he is thrifty and simple, always alert to the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. He believes that a revolutionary cadre can only be revolutionized, not special. He often uses Chairman Mao's teaching of "We communists are not here to be officials, but to revolutionize" to urge himself. When going to the countryside, he often carries his luggage on his back, walking from one village to another, and staying and eating in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. He often sings revolutionary songs and does morning exercises with his comrades; when attending meetings and parades, he voluntarily carries the banner and stands in the ranks.

Under the influence of Comrade Li Zhiyong, the members of the county revolutionary committee all took the lead in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, working hard, closely connecting with the masses, and effectively promoting the ideological revolutionization of cadres and masses.

	Always remembering shortcomings, not recording personal achievements

Chairman Mao teaches: "Whoever only sees the achievements and not the shortcomings will not be able to fight well for the realization of the party's tasks." Comrade Li Zhiyong remembers Chairman Mao's teachings, often consciously examines his shortcomings in ideology, style, and work, and achieves the effect of always remembering shortcomings and never recording personal achievements. He said, "Not seeing shortcomings is the biggest shortcoming, not finding gaps is the biggest gap. Recording achievements on oneself will be far away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and recording achievements on one's head will not be able to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployments closely."

Once, Li Zhiyong, carrying Chairman Mao's works, visited various units of the agricultural and forestry system, looked around, and had a discussion with comrades, which received praise from comrades. Everyone said, "Comrade Li is so busy with work, but he still comes to us and has a discussion with everyone. He is truly our good leader." The praise from the masses initially sounded pleasant to Li Zhiyong. However, after careful consideration, he felt something was wrong. He thought, I only went down to have a look and a discussion with everyone, and the masses praised me. This shows that I still go down too little, and the masses still do not regard me as an ordinary person. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people," and find gaps in the praise of the masses, and continuously achieve new successes for the revolution.

Comrade Li Zhiyong did something beneficial to the people and received praise from the masses. But he was not complacent and decided to be like Comrade Men He, serving as the people's "ox" for a lifetime, pulling the revolutionary cart for a lifetime, and following Chairman Mao to revolutionize for a lifetime.

    他是人民的好勤务员
    ——记山西吉县革命委员会主任李志勇同志
    天麻麻亮，社员们陆续下地劳动，一个四十开外的中年人，身穿褪了色的蓝布褂子，头扎毛巾，挽着裤腿，挑着满满的两大筐粪，唱着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录歌，迈着健壮的步伐走了过来。有人笑着问他：“你又担开粪了！”他回答说：“这是咱劳动人民的本分，一辈子也不能变！”
    这个中年人就是山西省吉县革命委员会主任李志勇同志，原先是这个县的县委副书记。大家都说：“咱们的老李同志，是人民的好勤务员。”
        晴天一身土　雨天一身泥
    贫农出身的李志勇同志，抗日战争时期就参加了革命。二十多年来，他在毛泽东思想的阳光哺育下，始终保持着劳动人民的本色。去年四月，李志勇被选为县革命委员会主任，他怀着无比激动的心情，在日记里写道：敬爱的毛主席！我永远忠于您！一定牢记您的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，一刻不脱离劳动，一刻不脱离群众，决不沾染做官当老爷的剥削阶级坏作风，永远保持无产阶级朝气勃勃的革命青春。
    李志勇走到那里就劳动在那里，碰到啥活就干啥活，一点一滴的时间都不放过。在机关，他参加义务劳动从不缺勤；下了乡，那里有社员劳动，他就出现在那里。
    李志勇能够经常参加劳动，是他自觉地狠斗官气的结果。一次，他到柳沟大队蹲点，按队长的安排和一部分社员到羊圈里出粪。羊圈跳蚤不少，他担了没几回，腿上被咬了好多疙瘩。这时，他思想上闪出了一个念头：不如放下担子和其他社员垒粪去吧！这个怕苦的思想刚一露头，他立刻意识到不对：“为啥社员不怕咬，偏偏自己怕咬，这是官气在作怪。能不能顶住跳蚤咬，坚持干下去，这是愿不愿打掉官气的大问题。毛主席教导我们：‘干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义’。我一定按照毛主席的教导办事。”想到这里，李志勇把裤腿一卷，又和大伙一块担起来了。
    李志勇经常实打实地参加集体生产劳动，晴天一身土，雨天一身泥，天长日久，群众都把他看做知心人，无论革命、生产中的问题都找他谈，使他对群众的情绪摸的清，对工作中的问题抓的准，进一步改进了革委会的工作。他深有感触地说：“汗和群众流在一起，话就能和群众说到一块，心就和群众越贴越紧。”
      站在第一线　不断立新功
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，李志勇同志坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下冲杀出来，和广大革命群众一起，向党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决的斗争。他担任革命委员会主任后，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，坚定地站在阶级斗争第一线，不断地为人民立新功。
    今年四月，毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示发表后，李志勇当天就深入城关公社各队，传达毛主席的最新指示。他过一村宣传一村，走一路宣传一路，就是遇到一个人，也要把毛主席的最新指示给他读几遍。
    毛主席的声音传到那里，那里的广大革命群众就紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大揭阶级斗争的盖子，很快在全县范围内掀起了对敌斗争的新高潮。李志勇同志很快深入下去，到阶级斗争最复杂的中垛公社蹲点，既当战斗员，又当指挥员。他组织群众认真学习了毛主席关于对敌斗争的方针政策和正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的语录，用党的政策去武装群众，进一步孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    广大革命群众掌握了党的政策，心明眼亮，斗志昂扬，把那些叛徒、特务、国民党残渣余孽和其他反革命分子一个个挖了出来。这时，李志勇发现有些地方对揪出来的阶级敌人一揪二斗三不管，没在批字上狠下功夫，没把批修和斗私紧密结合起来，他就在安坪大队举办了革命大批判学习班，帮助那里的群众，深入持久地开展革命大批判。大家学习毛主席一条语录，批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的一个修正主义论点，狠触一次灵魂，肃清一股流毒。李志勇接着又帮助这里的革命群众总结了开展革命大批判的经验，传到全县各地，促进了全县革命大批判的深入开展。
    在阶级斗争的实践中，李志勇深刻地体会到，要联系群众，就必须站在阶级斗争的最前列，狠狠打击阶级敌人，保护广大人民群众。他说：“不抓阶级斗争，就是最大的脱离群众。”
    那里有事那里办　处处带头做榜样
    李志勇担任县革委会主任以后，始终坚持那里有事那里办，处处带头做榜样。一年多来，他除了参加必要的会议外，从不蹲在机关。他走到那里，就在那里办公，就在那里宣传毛泽东思想，就把毛主席的声音传到那里。全县各公社九十五个大队，五百五十六个生产队，几乎到处都有他的脚印。他要求干部们工作越忙越要下去，要在点上学习，点上改造，点上扎根。他经常在点上做调查研究，解决问题，和群众一起参加斗争，帮助群众把零散的经验集中起来，总结推广，更好地指导面上的工作。去年以来，他先后发现、总结和推广了九个点的经验，有力地促进了全县各项工作蓬蓬勃勃的向前发展。
    李志勇对毛主席的伟大战略部署步步紧跟，对毛主席的指示认真学习、坚决照办。他对自己要求严格，凡是要别人干的，自己就先动手。他经常以自己的模范行动，为革委会成员和其他干部做好三个样子：忠于毛主席、紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的好样子；突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛泽东思想的好样子；一时一刻也不脱离群众，全心全意为人民服务的好样子。他常说，领导干部的一言一行，每时每刻都在影响着群众。自己的自觉革命精神强不强，不仅关系到自身的革命化，而且关系到革委会成员、广大干部和群众的革命化。自己不带头学习和执行毛主席的指示，就没有资格向广大干部和革命群众宣传毛泽东思想。因此，他带头发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，对毛泽东思想学了就用，立竿见影。
    一次，李志勇下乡到山阳大队，他发现贫农饲养员刘老四对毛主席著作学得好，用得活。当天晚上，他就在油灯下重温了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，对照刘老四找自己在学习毛主席著作上的差距。他在学习心得中写道：贫下中农对毛主席著作学习得最认真，执行得最坚决，落实得最迅速，永远是自己学习的好榜样。
    李志勇听毛主席的话，老老实实地做人民的勤务员。他做调查、写报告，从不依靠秘书，总是自己动手。在机关，饭前饭后，他帮炊事员担水洗碗。出门坐火车，他帮助列车员扶老携幼、擦洗地板。外出住招待所，他帮助招待员提水扫地。下到农村，除参加集体生产劳动外，他常帮助饲养员铡草、垫圈……。
    在生活作风上，他艰苦朴素，时刻警惕资产阶级思想的侵蚀。他认为，一个革命干部只能革命化，不能特殊化。他经常用毛主席“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导，鞭策自己。他下乡常常身背行李，徒步由这个山庄走向另一个山庄，吃住在贫下中农家里。他经常和同志们一起唱革命歌曲，上早操；开会游行的时候，他主动抬标语牌，站在队伍的行列里。
    在李志勇同志带动下，这个县的革委会成员们都带头活学活用毛泽东思想，艰苦奋斗，紧密联系群众，有力地促进了干部和群众的思想革命化。
      时刻不忘缺点　不记个人成绩
    毛主席教导说：“谁要是只看见成绩一面，不看见缺点一面，谁也就不会很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”李志勇同志牢记毛主席的教导，经常自觉地检查自己思想上、作风上、工作上的缺点，做到了时刻不忘缺点，永远不记个人成绩。他说：“看不到缺点是最大的缺点，找不到差距是最大的差距，把成绩往自己身上记一点，就会离毛主席的革命路线万丈远，把成绩往自己头上记一分，就会对毛主席的战略部署跟不紧。”
    一次，李志勇带着毛主席著作到农林系统各单位走了走，看了看，和同志们一起谈了谈，因而受到同志们的赞扬。大家都说：“老李工作那么忙，还到我们这里和大家座谈，真是我们的好领班。”群众的赞扬，李志勇开始听起来觉得很顺耳。但是，他仔细一琢磨就感到不对劲。他想，自己只是到下面去走了走，看了看，群众就赞扬，这说明自己还是下去得太少了，群众还没有把自己看成是一个普通的老百姓。我们一定要永远牢记毛主席“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，在群众的赞扬声中找差距，不断为革命立新功。
    李志勇同志做了有益于人民的事，受到了群众的赞扬。但他毫不自满，他决心要做到象门合同志那样，当一辈子人民的“牛”，拉一辈子革命的车，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
