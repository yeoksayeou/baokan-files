	U.S. Impudently Establishes "Museum" to Summon Hitler's Spirit
	West German People Angrily Protest

	New China News Agency, December 18th: Munich News: The people of West Germany have recently angrily protested the shameless act of the U.S. occupying authorities in West Germany, who have brazenly established a "museum" for Hitler, the German fascist leader who has long been reviled by the world's people.

	According to reports, the U.S. Seventh Army authorities stationed in southern Bavaria, West Germany, are in the process of converting the villas of Hitler, Göring, and other fascist leaders on the Upper Salzberg Mountain in this state into a "Hitler Museum." In this so-called "museum," Hitler's office and bedroom are arranged as they were at the time. They also plan to have a mannequin dressed in Hitler's SS uniform, holding a gun, standing at the museum's entrance.

	The U.S. occupying authorities' blatant act of summoning Hitler's spirit and erecting monuments for German fascist leaders has provoked great indignation among the people of West Germany. They have expressed their protests to the U.S. military authorities and the West German government. They pointed out that this is a great insult to the German people, especially to the hundreds of millions of victims who were brutally slaughtered by the fascists.

	According to another report, some organizations in the United States have recently also protested this incident to U.S. Secretary of Defense Clifford.

    西德人民愤怒提出抗议
    新华社十八日讯　慕尼黑消息：西德人民最近愤怒抗议在西德的美国占领军当局悍然为早已被世界人民所唾弃的德国法西斯头目希特勒建立“博物馆”的无耻行径。
    据报道，驻扎在西德南部巴伐利亚州的美国第七军当局，正在动手把位于这个州的上扎尔茨贝格山上的希特勒、戈林和其他法西斯头目的别墅改为
  “希特勒博物馆”。在这个所谓“博物馆”里，按照当年的样子，布置希特勒的办公室和卧室。还计划做一个假人穿着希特勒党卫军的制服，持枪站在博物馆门口。
    美国占领军当局公然为希特勒招魂，为德国法西斯头目树碑立传的挑衅行为，激起西德人民极大愤慨。他们纷纷向美军当局和西德当局表示抗议。他们指出，这是德国人民，特别是对被法西斯残酷屠杀的数百万牺牲者的极大侮辱。
    另据报道，在美国的一些组织，最近也就这一事件向美国国防部长克利福德提出抗议。
