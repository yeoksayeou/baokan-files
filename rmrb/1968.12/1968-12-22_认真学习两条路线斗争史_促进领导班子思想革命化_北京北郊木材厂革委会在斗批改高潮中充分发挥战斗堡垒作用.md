The revolutionary committee of Beijing North Suburb Timber Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions to "pay attention to historical experience. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be known to the broad revolutionary masses." They have seriously studied the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, significantly raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and their consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This has effectively promoted the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadres, enabling the revolutionary committee to fully play the role of a fighting fortress during the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Seriously studying the history of the struggle between the two lines to grasp power for the working class and use it well

After the editorial in _People's Daily_, _Red Flag_ magazine, and _Liberation Army Daily_ titled "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "paying attention to historical experience" and reprinted Chairman Mao's brilliant report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the revolutionary committee of Beijing North Suburb Timber Factory immediately set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, organizing all committee members to seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Through the study, they deeply realized that the struggle between the two lines within the Party reflects the class struggle in society, and the core of the struggle is the issue of power. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." They said: The struggle between the two lines in our timber factory over the past decade has also revolved around the issue of power. Our revolutionary committee must grasp power for the working class and use it well. During the study, they carried out extensive activities of "exposing, criticizing, recalling, and praising." "Exposing" means exposing the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, the history of the struggle between the two lines during the two-year cultural revolution, and the history of the struggle between the two lines in this factory; "criticizing" means linking the actual struggle between the two lines in this factory to criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line; "recalling" means recalling the suffering under the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line and the pain of having no power in the old society; "praising" means praising the profound correctness and greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the happiness of having power in the new society. Through these activities of "exposing, criticizing, recalling, and praising," the committee members further understood the importance of grasping power for the working class and using it well, and the responsibility of defending the proletarian revolutionary power. They said: The working class having power means having everything, losing power means losing everything. This factory was developed from more than 200 small factories through several mergers after the public-private partnership in 1956. Before the cultural revolution, due to the capitalist roaders in the factory pushing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, capitalists were given important positions, with some becoming deputy directors, some becoming heads of production departments, and some becoming workshop directors. In the first workshop, the workshop director was changed three times, but no matter how many times it was changed, it was always a capitalist. A technician in this workshop was demoted to a janitor for criticizing the workshop director. The capitalist who usurped the power of the workshop director implemented bourgeois dictatorship on this technician. The capitalist roaders in the factory also wanted workers to "respect" capitalists and "learn" from them. Thinking back to these events, the committee members were deeply indignant and said: "How can capitalists representing the interests of the bourgeoisie become deputy directors and workshop directors? They can only represent the interests of the bourgeoisie!" The living history of the struggle between the two lines in the factory over the past decade deeply educated them, making them realize that they must grasp power for the working class and use it well. They said: We must never forget the struggle between the two lines. We must repeatedly discuss Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and repeatedly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, leading revolutionary workers to continuously raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, striving to consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship.

Seriously studying the history of the struggle between the two lines to further strengthen the connection with the masses

Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary committee of Beijing North Suburb Timber Factory further strengthened its connection with the masses. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres going down to labor were issued, the factory revolutionary committee, except for leaving one deputy director and two committee members to handle daily work, sent all other committee members to the production front line. However, some committee members went down with the idea of "enjoying work in the workshop," so the problem of connecting with the masses was not fundamentally solved for all committee members. This time, through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, they realized that the core of the struggle between the two lines is the issue of power, and the issue surrounding power is the attitude towards the masses. They said: Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit is the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; not believing in the masses and suppressing the masses is the essence of Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line. How can we truly believe in and rely on the masses? The members of the revolutionary committee of Beijing North Suburb Timber Factory, through their study, realized that they must raise the issue of attitude towards the masses to the height of the struggle between the two lines. The issue of attitude towards the masses is the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can we truly solve the problem of connecting with the masses. Chairman Mao pointed out in his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class." However, the capitalist roaders in the factory, together with their master Liu Shaoqi, falsely claimed that the working class is "unreliable." The committee members, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the backwardness of the masses." On the basis of raising their awareness, the members of the revolutionary committee of Beijing North Suburb Timber Factory examined the problems in their connection with the masses. They believed that in connecting with the masses, there were "three less" and "three not as good as." "Three less" means: Few committee members in the revolutionary committee went down to work, participated in production labor, and talked with workers; few committee members who went down to participate in production labor took the initiative to work, reflected on the situation, and discussed work. "Three not as good as" means: Their enthusiasm was not as great as the workers', their work was not as hard as the workers', and their lives were not as simple and frugal as the workers'. Therefore, during the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, they invited workers to the revolutionary committee to give suggestions and also went deep into the workshops and teams to hold meetings, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses. Now, they have achieved: Political work reaches the small groups, production command reaches the site, and problems are solved at the grassroots level. Once, an old worker found the deputy director of the factory revolutionary committee, Zhang Bishen, and said: "Someone in our factory takes the factory's sawdust home to make a fire. I have mentioned this to you several times. The masses trust you and ask you to manage the home, so you must manage it well!" Zhang Bishen, after hearing the masses' criticism, immediately convened a meeting of the revolutionary committee members to study and decided to strengthen political and ideological education work, quickly stopping this phenomenon, and receiving praise from the masses. A committee member went to the workshop to labor. Initially, he thought: As long as I do heavy work, it will be fine, and the masses will be satisfied. But he did not expect that during the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the masses of a small group in this workshop criticized him, saying: "We are not lacking your labor force. You must not just bury your head in labor and forget about class struggle." Through the study, he realized that he must not forget about class struggle and the struggle between the two lines and just bury his head in labor. Originally, there was a bad element in this small group who stirred up trouble during the evaluation of the "five good" members. Later, this revolutionary committee member and the workers together severely grasped class struggle, exposing the true face of that bad element. He deeply felt: Only by continuously raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines can we better connect with the masses.

Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the relationship between the revolutionary committee and the masses has become even closer. The committee members go deep into the masses, care for the masses; the masses love the revolutionary committee, help and support the revolutionary committee. The members of the revolutionary committee and the masses are of one heart, advancing together under the guidance of Chairman Mao.

Seriously studying the history of the struggle between the two lines to continue maintaining the fine tradition of hard struggle

With the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, the revolutionary committee of Beijing North Suburb Timber Factory led all revolutionary workers in the factory to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and in just two or three months, transformed this "difficult" unit into an advanced unit. In this situation, some committee members developed a sense of complacency. During this study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary committee organized the committee members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings in his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "The victory of the nation is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li.... We must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, non-arrogance, and non-impatience, and we must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." They revisited Chairman Mao's great teachings and felt particularly close. They said: The achievements of our factory are achieved with the help of our comrades-in-arms, relying on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from above and the broad revolutionary masses from below. We have no reason to be complacent. Therefore, every time a sister unit comes to visit, they compare their strengths and find their weaknesses. They said: After becoming a cadre, one must not be separated from the masses; after achieving results, one must not be complacent; after winning victories, one must beware of the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, so as to always implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary committee maintains the style of hard struggle in everything. The office of the revolutionary committee uses sawdust instead of coal for heating. The revolutionary committee also calls on each workshop to save coal. Many production teams also use sawdust for heating. The boiler room also burns sawdust, and just one boiler room saves the country more than 20 tons of coal per month.

The members of the revolutionary committee of Beijing North Suburb Timber Factory, through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, have significantly raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, formulated specific measures to further strengthen the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadres, and stipulated that a struggle against selfishness and criticism and repudiation meeting should be held every month, and a small rectification with the participation of mass representatives should be conducted every quarter, placing the revolutionary committee under the supervision of the broad revolutionary masses.

Currently, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, the revolutionary committee of this factory is leading all revolutionary workers in the factory to, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

    认真学习两条路线斗争史　促进领导班子思想革命化
    北京北郊木材厂革委会在斗批改高潮中充分发挥战斗堡垒作用
    据新华社二十日讯　北京市北郊木材厂革命委员会，在驻厂人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，认真地学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，大大提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，提高了执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，有效地促进了领导班子的思想革命化，使革委会在斗、批、改高潮中充分发挥了战斗堡垒的作用。
    认真学习两条路线斗争史为工人阶级掌好权用好权
    在《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》传达了毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意”的最新指示和毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的光辉报告重新发表之后，北郊木材厂革委会立即办起了毛泽东思想学习班，组织全体委员认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史。通过学习，他们深深认识到：党内的路线斗争，反映了社会上的阶级斗争，而斗争的中心，是政权问题。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”他们说：我们木材厂十几年来两条路线的斗争，也是围绕着一个“权”字。我们革委会一定要为工人阶级掌好权、用好权。在学习中，他们开展了大摆、大批、大忆、大颂活动。大摆，就是摆党内两条路线斗争的历史，摆两年多来无产阶级文化大革命运动中两条路线斗争的历史，摆本厂两条路线斗争的历史；大批，就是联系本厂两条路线斗争的实际，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线；大忆，就是忆受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，忆旧社会无权的痛苦；大颂，就是颂扬毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无比英明、正确、伟大，颂扬新社会有权的幸福。通过大摆、大批、大忆、大颂，使革委会成员进一步懂得了为工人阶级掌好权、用好权的重要，保卫无产阶级革命政权的责任。他们说：工人阶级有了政权，就有了一切，丧失了政权，就丧失了一切。这个厂，是一九五六年公私合营时由二百多个小厂经过多次合并发展起来的。无产阶级文化大革命前，由于厂内走资派推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，资本家受到重用，有的当了副厂长，有的当了生产科长，有的当了车间主任。第一车间，车间主任换了三个，可是换来换去都是资本家。这个车间的一个技术工人，因为对车间主任提了意见，就遭到排挤打击。篡夺了车间主任大权的资本家，把这个技术工调去当杂工，对他实行资产阶级专政。厂内走资派还要工人“尊重”资本家，向资本家“学习”。一回想起这些，革委会委员们无比愤慨地说：“资本家当副厂长，当车间主任，他们怎能代表工人阶级的利益？他们只能代表资产阶级的利益！”厂内十几年来活生生的两条路线斗争史，深刻地教育了他们，使他们深深懂得：一定要为工人阶级掌好权、用好权。他们说：我们一时一刻也不能忘掉两条路线的斗争。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线我们要经常讲，反复讲，刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，我们要经常批，反复批，带领革命职工不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为不断巩固和加强无产阶级专政而奋斗。
    认真学习两条路线斗争史进一步密切同群众的联系
    北郊木材厂革委会，通过两条路线斗争史的学习，进一步密切了同群众的联系。在毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示发表后，厂革委会除了留下一个副主任和两个委员负责日常工作外，其他委员都深入到了生产第一线。但是，有的委员是抱着“在车间干活痛快”的想法下去的，因此，联系群众的问题，并不是所有委员都从根本上得到了解决。这次通过两条路线斗争史的学习，他们认识到：两条路线斗争的中心，是政权问题，而围绕着政权问题的，是对待群众的态度问题。他们说：相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的核心；不相信群众，镇压群众，是刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线的本质。怎样才能真正做到相信和依靠群众？北郊木材厂革委会成员通过学习体会到：必须把对待群众的态度问题，提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识。对待群众的态度问题，就是对待毛主席无产阶级革命路线的态度问题。只有坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能真正解决联系群众的问题。毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告中指出：“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。过去厂内走资派却和他们的主子刘少奇唱一个调子，胡说什么工人阶级“不可靠”。革委会成员根据毛主席的教导，狠批了刘少奇的“群众落后论”。在提高认识的基础上，北郊木材厂革委会成员检查了联系群众方面存在的问题。他们认为在联系群众方面有“三少”和“三不如”。“三少”是：在革委会抓工作的委员，下去的少，参加生产劳动少，和工人谈心少；下去参加生产劳动的委员，主动抓工作少，反映情况少，交谈工作少。“三不如”是：干劲不如工人大，工作不如工人辛苦，生活不如工人艰苦朴素。于是，他们在学习两条路线斗争史的过程中，把工人请来给革委会提意见，同时又深入车间和班组，召集座谈会，虚心听取群众意见。现在，他们做到了：政治工作到小组，生产指挥到现场，解决问题到基层。有一次，一位老工人找到革委会，对厂革委会副主任张璧臣说：“咱们厂有人把公家的刨花拿回家生火，这件事我已经给你提过几次了，群众信任你，叫你当家，你可要把家当好啊！”张璧臣听了群众的批评，立即召集革委会委员进行研究，决定加强政治思想教育工作，很快就杜绝了这种现象，受到群众好评。有一个委员，到车间劳动。起初他想：只要拣重活干，就行了，干活好，群众就会满意。可是没想到，在学习两条路线斗争史时，这个车间的一个小组的群众批评他说：我们不是缺少你这个劳动力，你可不能只顾埋头劳动，忘了阶级斗争。通过学习，他认识到，绝不能忘掉阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，只是埋头干活。原来，这个小组有一个坏人，在小组评“五好”时，挑拨离间。后来，这个革委会委员和工人一起狠抓阶级斗争，揭露了那个坏家伙的真面目。他深有体会地说：只有不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，才能更好地联系群众。
    通过两条路线斗争史的学习，革委会和群众的关系更加密切了。革委会委员深入群众，关心群众；群众爱护革委会，帮助和支持革委会，革委会成员和群众一条心，共同按照毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进。
    认真学习两条路线斗争史继续保持艰苦奋斗的优良作风
    北郊木材厂革委会，在驻厂人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，率领全厂广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在短短的两三个月时间里，使这个厂从“老大难”单位，一跃而成为先进单位。在这种情况下，个别委员产生了自满情绪。这次学习两条路线斗争史时，革委会组织委员们反复地学习了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告中的这一教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”他们重温毛主席的这一伟大教导，感到格外亲切。他们说：我们厂所取得的这些成绩，是在亲人解放军的帮助下，上靠毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，下靠广大革命群众才取得的，我们丝毫没有值得骄傲自满的理由。因此，每当兄弟单位来参观一次，他们就对照别人的长处找一次差距。他们说：当了干部，不能脱离群众；有了成绩，不能骄傲自满；取得了胜利，要预防资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，这样才能永远执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。革委会事事处处保持艰苦奋斗的作风。革委会办公室里，取暖不用煤，而是用锯末。革委会还号召各车间节约用煤。很多生产小组都用锯末取暖。锅炉房也烧锯末，仅一个锅炉房，每月就为国家节约二十多吨煤。
    北郊木材厂革命委员会成员，通过两条路线斗争史的学习，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，制定了进一步加强领导班子思想革命化的具体措施，规定每月开一次斗私批修讲用会，每季度进行一次有群众代表参加的小整风，把革委会置于广大革命群众监督之下。
    目前，这个厂的革委会在驻厂人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，正在率领全厂广大革命职工，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
