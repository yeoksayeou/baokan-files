The more meticulously and far-sightedly we calculate the political account, the higher the consciousness of poor and lower-middle peasants in managing schools will be, the more and better revolutionary successors of the proletariat will be cultivated, and the more consolidated the red political power of the proletariat will be.

The suggestion made by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu to transfer the public primary school to the production brigade for management is entirely in line with Mao Zedong Thought and meets the demands of us poor and lower-middle peasants. In recent days, everyone has been enthusiastically discussing how to manage the Wulong Primary School, which has been transferred to our brigade. However, some people are only busy calculating the small accounts, considering how to reasonably bear the work points of teachers and the expenses of the school. We think that while economic accounts must be calculated, the political account must be calculated first.

The school is an important battlefield for us to cultivate revolutionary successors. Only by firmly occupying this battlefield can we ensure that the descendants of poor and lower-middle peasants will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and become good soldiers of Chairman Mao, forever advancing along the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. Let us recall the bitter taste of the past when the leadership of the school was not in the hands of poor and lower-middle peasants! Under the protection of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, Wulong Primary School, established for twenty years, had thirteen heads in succession, none of whom were from poor and lower-middle peasants. Although it was a public primary school, located in our brigade, it was never under the leadership of the brigade party branch and could not sincerely serve poor and lower-middle peasants. One morning in the summer of 1964, when I and the poor peasant member Yao XiuLin were working in the fields, we passed by the school gate and glanced into the courtyard. We saw that out of the six students leading the exercises, four were children of landlords and rich peasants. At that time, Yao XiuLin angrily said, "Why can't our children do it?" We rushed in to question the head teacher, but he said, "Whoever can do it can be used, and whoever can't do it can't be used!" He blatantly defended his reactionary class. We eagerly awaited Chairman Mao's latest directive, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," before we could take control of Wulong Primary School. In just three months, we rectified the teaching staff and, together with revolutionary teachers, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary educational thought, launching a massive revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. To help teachers with their ideological revolution, we had them teach while participating in labor and class struggle with poor and lower-middle peasants. This fundamentally changed the original face of the school. The twelve-year-old poor peasant child Wang Zhifu, who was once considered a "naughty student," has now become an active advocate of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought among primary school students in the entire commune. He insists on carrying a classmate with soft bone disease to school every day, helping military dependents carry water and sweep the yard with other children, herding cows and chickens for the brigade, and spreading Mao Zedong Thought everywhere. We let him go to various production teams to share his experiences. An old poor peasant, Xu Guocai, in the first team, who is over sixty years old, patted his head excitedly after listening to his sharing, saying, "It's not that our children are stupid, it's all about how the school cultivates them. This child used to be worthless, but now he has become a 'little guerrilla.' Only when we poor and lower-middle peasants manage the school can we cultivate our reliable successors!" The changes in Wulong Primary School before and after being managed by poor and lower-middle peasants have made us realize more clearly that transferring the public primary school to the brigade for management is the fundamental way for us poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp the leadership of the school. Only when we poor and lower-middle peasants grasp the educational power can we serve poor and lower-middle peasants and cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The account we calculate is to calculate this big account. The more meticulously and far-sightedly this political account is calculated, the higher our consciousness in managing primary schools will be, the more and better successors of poor and lower-middle peasants will be cultivated, and the more consolidated the red political power of the proletariat will be.

    要算培养革命接班人的政治账
    政治账算得越细、越远，贫下中农管理学校的自觉性就会越高，无产阶级革命事业的接班人就培养得越多、越好，无产阶级的红色政权也就越巩固。
    侯振民、王庆余两位同志关于把公办小学下放到大队来办的建议，完全符合毛泽东思想，符合咱贫下中农的要求。这些天来，大伙都在热烈讨论，怎样把下放给咱们大队的乌龙小学管理好。但是，也有的人却只在那里扒拉小算盘，考虑教师的工分和学校的经费如何合理负担。我们想，经济账固然要算，但是首先要算好政治账。
    学校，是我们培养革命接班人的重要阵地。我们只有牢牢占领这个阵地，才能使咱贫下中农的后代永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好战士，永远沿着毛主席指引的革命道路胜利前进。让我们回想一下过去学校领导权不在贫下中农手里的滋味吧！在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线庇护下，乌龙小学建校二十年，前后十三任负责教员，没有一个是我们贫下中农的人。因为是公办小学，虽然是办在咱们大队，却从不受大队党支部的领导，不能真心实意地为贫下中农服务。一九六四年夏天的一个早上，我和贫农社员姚修林下地干活，路过学校门口，往院里一瞧，见领操的六个学生中就有四个是地富子女。当时姚修林气愤地说：“咱们的子女为什么就不行？”我们跑进去责问那个负责教员，他却说什么：“谁行就用谁，不行就不能用嘛！”竟然明目张胆地为他的反动阶级辩护。我们好容易盼到了毛主席发出“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示，才把乌龙小学的领导权掌握在自己手里。经过短短的三个月，我们对教师队伍进行了整顿，和革命教师一起活学活用毛主席的无产阶级教育革命思想，对刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线展开了声势浩大的革命大批判。为了帮助教师们搞好思想革命化，我们叫他们一面教书，一面和贫下中农一起参加劳动，参加队里的阶级斗争。这样就从根本上改变了学校原来的面貌。十二岁的贫农孩子王志富，过去一向被认为是“调皮生”，现在却变成了全公社小学生中活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。他坚持天天背一个得软骨病的同学上学，和小朋友一起给军属抬水扫院子，给队里赶牛看小鸡，处处宣传毛泽东思想。我们让他到各个小队去讲用，一队六十多岁的老贫农徐国才听了他的讲用体会，摸着他的头激动地说：“不是咱们的孩子脑子笨，全在于学校怎么培养。过去这孩子给猴都不换，现在成了‘小八路’了。只有咱们贫下中农管理学校，才能培养出咱们放心的后生啊！”
    贫下中农管理乌龙小学前后的变化，使我们更加看清楚了公办小学下放到大队办是我们贫下中农掌握学校领导权的根本途径。只有咱贫下中农掌握学校的教育大权，才能为咱贫下中农服务，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们算账，就是要算这笔大账。这笔政治账算得越细，越远，咱们管理好小学的自觉性就会越高，咱们贫下中农的接班人培养得就越多越好，无产阶级红色政权就越巩固。吉林东辽县梨树公社乌龙大队革命委员会主任
