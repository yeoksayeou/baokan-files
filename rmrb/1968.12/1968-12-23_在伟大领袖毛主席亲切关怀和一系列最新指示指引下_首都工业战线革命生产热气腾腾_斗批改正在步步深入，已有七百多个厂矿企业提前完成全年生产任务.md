Under the caring concern and guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao and his latest series of instructions, the revolutionary production in the capital's industrial sector is booming. The struggle, criticism, and reform are deepening, and over 700 enterprises have completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, under the caring concern of the great leader Chairman Mao and the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and under the great inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the working class of the capital is vigorously carrying out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They are fighting in the last month of this year and actively preparing for the leap in production next year. Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in the city's industrial sector is excellent, with the struggle, criticism, and reform deepening step by step. Over 700 enterprises have completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has greatly promoted the development of Beijing's industrial production capacity. Since the beginning of this year, the total industrial output value of the capital has been continuously increasing, with each quarter surpassing the previous one. From July to October, the total industrial output value of the city increased by more than 9% compared to the same period in 1966. In November, there was a new leap, creating the highest monthly output value in recent years, nearly a quarter higher than the highest monthly level in 1966. This month, the production of 37 major products, including steel, steel materials, machine tools, automobiles, internal combustion engines, coke, chemical fertilizers, electric motors, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyed cloth, machine-made paper, sewing machines, plasticizers, plastic products, watches, detergent, and soap, has increased significantly. By the 17th of December, the city has already had enterprises such as the Knitting General Factory, Xinhua Printing Factory, Chemical Factory No. 3, Beijiao Wood Factory, Second Machine Tool Factory, Dongfanghong Automobile Factory, Hoisting Machinery Factory, Transformer Factory, Coking Factory, First General Machinery Factory, Second General Machinery Factory, Second Wool Factory, Radio and Television Factory, Pharmaceutical Factory, People's Machinery Factory, Beijing Electric Power Bureau, and Beijing Mining Bureau, totaling over 700 enterprises, completing their annual production tasks ahead of schedule.

The working class of the capital, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, is vigorously carrying out the revolution, using the revolution to lead production, which is the fundamental reason for achieving great success in production. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Motorcycle Manufacturing Factory, in fully implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, deeply studied the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "Six Black Articles" and "material incentives," "technology first," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. They learned from the People's Liberation Army, insisted on building the factory with proletarian politics in mind, and created a new situation where the factory is full of revolutionary enthusiasm and production is thriving. They completed the annual production task ahead of schedule by more than two months and broke the monthly production record of motorcycles multiple times. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Chemical Experimental Factory, according to the characteristics of class struggle in their factory, seriously criticized the "February Countercurrent" in 1967 and the evil wind of trying to reverse the "February Countercurrent" this spring, greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the masses, and increasing the enthusiasm for production. They completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule by 16 days and produced more and better chemical fertilizers for the state.

Throughout this year, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the capital's industrial sector has been magnificent, with tens of thousands of technological innovation projects implemented. Some projects have reached domestic and international advanced levels, and new products, new equipment, new processes, and new technologies have emerged in large numbers. To overcome technical difficulties and develop socialist production, many enterprises have broken down the boundaries of trades and shifts within the enterprise, and revolutionary cooperation has become the norm. Cooperation between factories and between industries has also been greatly promoted, and the spirit of communist cooperation has been greatly carried forward. The Beijing First, Second, and Third Cotton Spinning Mills and other seven units, in order to solve the problem of accelerating fine spinning and increasing cotton yarn production, jointly organized an "attack team" with old workers as the mainstay, achieving certain results.

    在伟大领袖毛主席亲切关怀和一系列最新指示指引下
    首都工业战线革命生产热气腾腾
    斗批改正在步步深入，已有七百多个厂矿企业提前完成全年生产任务
    据新华社二十一日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席亲切关怀和毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，首都工人阶级狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，奋战今年最后一个月，并积极为明年生产跃进作准备。目前，全市工业战线革命和生产形势一派大好，斗、批、改正在步步深入，已有七百多个厂矿企业提前完成了全年生产任务。
    两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，有力地促进了北京工业生产能力的大发展。今年年初以来，首都工业生产总值持续上升，一季胜过一季。从七月到十月四个月内，全市工业生产总值比一九六六年同期增长百分之九以上。十一月份，又出现新的飞跃，创造了近几年的月产值最高纪录，比一九六六年最高月水平增长将近四分之一。这个月，钢、钢材、机床、汽车、内燃机、焦炭、化肥、电动机、棉纱、棉布、印染布、机制纸、缝纫机、增塑剂、塑料制品、手表、洗衣粉、肥皂等三十七种主要产品的产量，都有较大幅度的增长。到十二月十七日止，全市已经有针织总厂、新华印刷厂、化工三厂、北郊木材厂、第二机床厂、东方红汽车厂、起重机器厂、变压器厂、焦化厂、第一通用机械厂、第二通用机械厂、第二毛纺厂、无线电联合厂、制药厂、人民机器厂以及北京电业局、北京矿务局所属单位，共七百多个厂矿企业，提前完成了全年的生产任务。
    首都工人阶级紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，用革命统帅生产，是在生产上取得巨大成就的根本原因。北京摩托车制造厂广大革命职工在全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务中，深入学习党内两条路线斗争史，狠批刘少奇的黑“六论”和“物质刺激”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，他们大学解放军，坚持走突出无产阶级政治的建厂道路，使全厂出现革命热气腾腾、生产蒸蒸日上的新局面，提前两个多月超额完成了全年的生产任务，并多次突破摩托车月产最高纪录。北京化工实验厂广大革命职工根据本厂阶级斗争的特点，严肃地批判了一九六七年的“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风，使广大群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，生产干劲倍增，提前十六天超额完成了全年的生产计划，为国家生产了更多更好的化肥。
    今年以来，首都工业战线技术革新、技术革命运动波澜壮阔，实现的技术革新项目有上万种，有些项目达到了国内外先进水平，新产品、新设备、新工艺、新技术大量涌现。为了攻克技术难关，为了发展社会主义生产，不少企业内部打破了工种、班组的界限，革命协作蔚然成风，工厂与工厂、行业与行业之间也互相支援，共产主义协作精神大大发扬。北京第一、二、三棉纺厂等七个单位为了解决细纱加速、增产棉纱的问题，共同组织了以老工人为主体的“攻关小组”，取得了一定的成效。
