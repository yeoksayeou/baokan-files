The workers of Shanghai and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, the birthplace of the red sun, share a common heart! Fifty "Harvest-35" tractors produced for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan have rolled off the assembly line at the Shanghai No. 1 Tractor Factory!

Representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, who came to Shanghai to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and to welcome the "iron oxen," beat drums and gongs and repeatedly raised their arms in salute as the tractors rolled off the line: "Salute to the Shanghai working class!" "Learn from the Shanghai working class!" The workers of the No. 1 Tractor Factory also repeatedly raised their arms in salute: "Salute to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan!" "Learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan!" Together, they shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao, long live, long live!"

With boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Shanghai working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, separated by thousands of miles, are closely united.

The newly produced fifty "Harvest-35" tractors are the result of the Shanghai No. 1 Tractor Factory workers' boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep proletarian feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Shanghai No. 1 Tractor Factory is a medium-sized factory with over a thousand employees. In late October, when the entire factory's revolutionary workers learned that they would be producing tractors for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, they were overjoyed. They excitedly said: Building the birthplace of the red sun—Shaoshan—is the common wish of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. Producing tractors for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan is our greatest honor and happiness! Some said: The poor and lower-middle peasants are the most reliable allies of the working class. Supporting the poor and lower-middle peasants and supporting the construction of socialist agriculture is the duty of the working class. Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, after heated discussions, they decided to complete the honorable task of producing tractors for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan as quickly as possible and with the best quality. Originally, the state stipulated that these fifty tractors could be delivered by the end of the year, and the tractor parts could be completed in the first quarter of next year. After discussions, the workers proposed that to allow the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan to use the tractors as soon as possible, they would complete the production of the tractors and all parts by November, one month ahead of schedule, and decided: This batch of tractors will not be painted green, but will all be painted red.

To complete the production of fifty tractors in November is indeed a very arduous task. According to the original state plan and the factory's production schedule, the factory originally had a production task of seventy tractors in November. If this batch of fifty is added, then one hundred twenty tractors would need to be produced in one month. Especially in September and October, the factory had already assembled a large number of tractors, and most of the processed tractor parts had been used up. To produce one hundred twenty tractors from steel raw materials to assembly in one month had never happened in the factory's history. However, the workers said proudly: We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will definitely overcome all difficulties and complete the production task of one hundred twenty tractors! Based on the opinions of all revolutionary workers in the factory, the revolutionary committee immediately wrote a letter to the relevant departments in Hunan Province, expressing their determination to complete the production of fifty tractors ahead of schedule to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan.

The news of the No. 1 Tractor Factory producing tractors for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan and the workers' determination to complete the task ahead of schedule reached Shaoshan. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan were deeply moved. They said, this is the great support of the Shanghai working class for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan decided to use greater achievements in seizing the revolution and promoting production to thank the Shanghai working class. In just a few days, they launched a new high tide of turning in surplus grain to the state and winter agricultural production. The Xiangtan County Revolutionary Committee and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan also decided to send a delegation to Shanghai to learn from the working class of the No. 1 Tractor Factory, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, to welcome the "iron oxen" to participate in the socialist construction of Shaoshan. The high level of awareness and revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan reached Shanghai, adding boundless confidence and strength to the workers of the No. 1 Tractor Factory to complete the task.

A great battle in November, a fierce fight to seize one hundred twenty tractors, began. The first to be challenged were the comprehensive and large component groups of the machining workshop. These two groups were responsible for the production of some of the main components of the tractors. The comprehensive group processed over thirty types of parts, all of which were oddly shaped. The processing of these parts involved many steps, long cycles, and some required more than ten steps; the requirements were high, and some tolerances could not exceed one-seventh the thickness of a hair. Moreover, the group had few workers, only about a dozen, most of whom were newly recruited young workers, with only two or three experienced workers. However, the revolutionary workers of the comprehensive group decided to overcome all difficulties and ensure the timely completion of the processing tasks. At this time, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued. Under the great encouragement of the plenary session, they used Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as weapons to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanghai for implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, sabotaging the development of agricultural mechanization, and obstructing tractor production. The revolutionary criticism and struggle further ignited the selfless labor enthusiasm of all the workers in the group, and they finally completed the processing of all parts.

The large component group was responsible for processing the rear axle housing, half shafts, half shaft sleeves, front axle brackets, and other large components. The workers of this group also displayed great enthusiasm, processing one component at a time and not leaving the machine until the task was completed. In this way, they fired the first shot in the battle to produce tractors for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan.

The machine repair workshop's mobile group, which was responsible for processing the tractor belt pulley parts, originally had a heavy production task. When they heard that they would be producing tractors for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, they thought of how tractors are used in the countryside for multiple purposes, not just plowing but also for pumping water and threshing. Shaoshan is a hilly area, and without belt pulleys, tractors could not be used for irrigation and drought relief. Therefore, they voluntarily proposed to advance the delivery of the belt pulleys, originally scheduled for the first quarter of next year, to this year with the tractors. Thus, the group's production task became even heavier and more urgent. But the workers of this group were not afraid of difficulties. They severely criticized the past counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management system implemented by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, boldly reformed the processing technology, reformed unreasonable regulations, carried out technological innovations, and changed the four-legged clamp originally used for processing belt pulleys to a mold, greatly improving production efficiency. As a result, they completed the production task ahead of schedule.

The painters in the painting group proposed in the battle to produce tractors for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan: Carefully paint every shell of the tractor to show the working class's boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the deep affection of all revolutionary workers in the factory for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan. Previously, the tractors produced by this factory were green, and the painting process required only one step. Now, changing to red required three steps, and each step required water polishing. Some workers' hands were rubbed raw, but not a single person complained. They spent a full fifteen days painting all fifty tractors a bright, shining red.

The final assembly was the most tense battle. After all the parts were processed and entered the assembly line, it was already November 26th. To complete the production task of one hundred twenty tractors, only four days remained. At this time, the entire factory was mobilized. In addition to the assembly workers working day and night in the assembly line, there were also leaders of the revolutionary committee and many workers from various workshops and groups. They worked tirelessly, and after three days and nights of hard work, they finally completed the assembly of the last tractor on the night of November 29th.

On December 16th, the fifty "Harvest-35" tractors produced by the Shanghai working class for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan were transported from Shanghai to Shaoshan. The revolutionary masses of Shaoshan held a grand welcoming ceremony for this.

That morning, Shaoshan was filled with the sound of drums and gongs. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers, Red Guards, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaoshan, with boundless joy in their hearts, held up portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, and rushed to the Shaoshan train station. At nine o'clock sharp, a train loaded with tractors entered the station amid cheers.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan warmly shook hands with the representatives of the Shanghai No. 1 Tractor Factory who had come to deliver the tractors. They excitedly shouted together: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years!" With the joy of a more solid worker-peasant alliance, they encouraged each other: Always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, always be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unite more closely, thoroughly implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, deeply carry out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly settle the accounts of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' treacherous crimes of betraying the party and the country, thoroughly criticize and purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the party, seriously carry out the struggle of class struggle, criticism, and transformation, and make greater contributions in the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production on the industrial and agricultural fronts, and report good news to Chairman Mao!

    上海工人阶级和韶山贫下中农心连心
    上海七一拖拉机厂为红太阳升起的地方——湖南湘潭韶山贫下中农生产的五十台“丰收——三五”拖拉机出厂了！
    专程来上海宣传毛泽东思想并迎接“铁牛”的韶山贫下中农代表们，在这批拖拉机出厂的时候，敲锣打鼓，不断振臂高呼：“向上海工人阶级致敬！”“向上海工人阶级学习！”七一拖拉机厂的工人们也不断高呼：“向韶山贫下中农致敬！”“向韶山贫下中农学习！”他们一起高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限热爱、无限忠诚，把远隔万水千山的上海工人阶级和韶山贫下中农，紧紧地连在了一起。
    新出厂的五十台“丰收——三五”拖拉机，是上海七一拖拉机厂的工人阶级，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心和对贫下中农的深厚无产阶级感情赶制出来的。上海七一拖拉机厂是一家有一千多名职工的中型厂。十月底，当全厂革命职工得知要为韶山贫下中农生产拖拉机的消息时，个个欢欣鼓舞。他们激动地说：建设红太阳升起的地方——韶山，这是亿万革命人民的共同心愿。我们为韶山贫下中农生产拖拉机，这是我们无比的光荣，巨大的幸福！有的说：贫下中农是工人阶级最可靠的同盟者，支援贫下中农、支援社会主义农业生产建设，这是工人阶级应尽的义务。在厂革命委员会的领导下，大家经过热烈讨论，决心以最快的速度、最好的质量，提前完成为韶山贫下中农生产拖拉机的光荣任务。原来国家规定，这五十台拖拉机可在年底交货，拖拉机部分配件可以到明年第一季度完成。工人们经过讨论提出，为了使韶山的贫下中农尽早用上拖拉机，要提前一个月在十一月份完成拖拉机和全部配件的生产任务，并且决定：这批拖拉机不漆草绿色，全部改漆成红色。
    要提前在十一月份制成五十台拖拉机，这个任务确实是很艰巨的。这个厂按照国家原定计划和工厂的生产安排，十一月份本来就有七十台拖拉机的生产任务，如果加上这五十台，那么一个月就要生产一百二十台。特别是九月份、十月份，这个厂已经装配出一大批拖拉机，加工好的拖拉机零部件大部分都用完了，要在一个月里，从钢材原料加工直到装配成一百二十台拖拉机，在这个厂历史上还从来没有过。但是工人们豪迈地说：我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，有毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引，我们一定能克服一切困难，完成一百二十台拖拉机的生产任务！根据全厂革命职工的意见，厂革委会立即写信给湖南省有关部门，向韶山贫下中农表示了提前制成五十台拖拉机的决心。
    七一拖拉机厂给韶山贫下中农生产拖拉机的喜讯和工人们保证提前完成任务的决心，传到了韶山。韶山的贫下中农都非常感动。他们说，这是上海工人阶级对韶山贫下中农的巨大支持。韶山的贫下中农决心用抓革命、促生产的更大成绩来感谢上海的工人阶级。短短几天内，他们就掀起了向国家交售余粮和冬季农业生产的新高潮。湘潭县革命委员会和韶山贫下中农还决定派出一个代表团，到上海向七一拖拉机厂的工人阶级学习，宣传毛泽东思想，迎接“铁牛”参加韶山的社会主义建设。韶山贫下中农的这种高度觉悟和昂扬的革命精神传到了上海，又给七一拖拉机厂的工人增添了完成任务的无穷信心和力量。
    一场大战十一月，夺取一百二十台拖拉机的紧张战斗开始了。首当其冲的是金工车间综合组和大件组。这两个组担负了拖拉机一些主要部件的生产任务。综合组加工的零件有三十多种，而且都是奇形的。加工这些零件工序多，周期长，有的要经过十几道工序；要求高，有的误差不能超过一根头发丝的七分之一。而且全组人手少，只有十几个工人，大部分都是刚进厂的年青工人，只有两三个老师傅。但是综合组的革命职工决心克服一切困难，保证按时完成加工任务。这时党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了。他们在全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，以毛主席的一系列最新指示为武器，深入开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在上海的代理人推行反革命修正主义路线，破坏农业机械化的发展、阻挠拖拉机生产的罪行。革命的大批判，进一步激发了全组革命职工忘我的劳动热情，终于完成了全部零部件的加工任务。
    大件组，是负责加工后桥壳体、半轴、半轴套管、前轴支架等大部件的。这个组的工人也发挥了冲天的干劲，来一个部件，就加工一个，不完成任务不下机床。就这样，他们打响了为韶山贫下中农生产拖拉机战斗的第一炮。
    担负加工拖拉机配件皮带轮任务的机修车间机动组，原来的生产任务就较重。当他们听到要为韶山贫下中农生产拖拉机时，就联想到，拖拉机在农村是综合使用的，除了耕田，还要做抽水、打谷的动力。韶山是丘陵地区，没有皮带轮，拖拉机就不能用到抽水抗旱上。于是，他们主动提出把原定明年第一季度交货的皮带轮，提前在今年和拖拉机一起交货。这样，小组的生产任务更重更紧了。但这个组的工人毫不畏难，他们狠批了过去党内一小撮走资派推行的反革命修正主义企业管理制度，大胆地改革了加工工艺，改革了不合理的规章制度，开展了技术革新，把原来加工皮带轮用的四脚夹头改用模子，大大提高了生产效率，结果提前完成了生产任务。
    油漆组的工人们在为韶山贫下中农生产拖拉机的战斗中提出：精心油漆好拖拉机的每一个外壳，要漆出工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，漆出全厂革命职工对韶山贫下中农的深情厚意。以前，这个厂生产的拖拉机是绿色，油漆颜色只要一道工序，现在改漆成红色，要三道工序，每一道工序都要用水磨，有的工人手磨出了水泡、血泡，但没有一个叫苦的。他们整整花了十五天的时间，把五十台拖拉机台台都油漆得红彤彤的，精光烁亮。
    最后的总装，是一场最紧张的战斗。全部零部件加工完毕进入总装配时，已经是十一月二十六日，要完成全部一百二十台拖拉机的生产任务，只剩下四天时间。这时，全厂都紧急动员起来了。在总装车间的流水线旁，除了装配组的工人在夜以继日地战斗外，还有厂革委会的负责人，以及许多车间、小组的工人。他们废寝忘食，经过三昼夜的苦战，终于在十一月二十九日夜晚完成了最后一台拖拉机的装配任务。
    十二月十六日，上海工人阶级为韶山贫下中农生产的五十台“丰收——三五”拖拉机，由上海运抵韶山了。韶山革命群众为此举行了隆重的欢迎大会。
    这天一清早，韶山锣鼓喧天，广大贫下中农、革命工人、红卫兵小将和人民解放军驻军指战员，怀着无限喜悦的心情，高举毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，奔向韶山车站。九时正，一列满载拖拉机的列车，在一片欢呼声中进站了。
    韶山贫下中农同专程运送拖拉机的上海七一拖拉机厂的工人代表热烈握手，他们激动地共同高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他们怀着工农联盟更加巩固的无限喜悦互相勉励：永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下更紧密地团结起来，全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，彻底清算大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其同伙的叛党叛国的滔天罪行，彻底批臭和肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义思想，认真搞好斗、批、改，在工业战线和农业战线抓革命促生产的斗争中，作出更大的贡献，向毛主席报喜！
