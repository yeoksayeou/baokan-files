The Unity Newspaper Exposes the New Deception of the US and USSR in Plotting a "Political Solution" for the Middle East
The Revisionist Soviets Are False Friends, True Enemies of the Arab People
The Arab People Will Not Be Intimidated or Deceived; They Will Definitely Strike Back Against the Aggressors

New China News Agency, Tirana, December 9th - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an editorial on the 8th, exposing and condemning the collusion between US imperialism and Soviet revisionism in supporting the Israeli reactionaries and plotting a new deception of a "political solution" for the Middle East.

The article points out that while the Israeli aggressors continue to massacre innocent Arab people and try to suppress the liberation movement of Palestinian patriots in the occupied areas through white terror, the US imperialists and the Soviet Khrushchev revisionists are using threats and deception to try to force the Arab countries to accept the so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem. It is clear that the Israeli reactionaries would not dare to oppress the Arab people without the support and assistance of their masters across the ocean, and without the tacit agreement of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist group, who continue to play the role of crying at night and killing by day against the Arab people.

The article states that the Soviet Khrushchev revisionists verbally support the Arab countries, swearing and vowing that they are friends and allies of the Arab countries, but in reality, they stab the Arab people in the back, forcing them to accept various "negotiations" and "solutions" that only satisfy the demands of the Israeli reactionaries, obstructing the Arab people's resistance against the aggressors and their allies.

The article exposes that the leaders in Washington and Moscow repeatedly throw out "proposals" to "solve" the Middle East problem, attempting to give the Israeli aggressors more time to stabilize their foothold in the occupied areas and weaken the fighting will of the Arab people and Palestinian patriots. At the same time, the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists are both amassing forces in the Mediterranean, trying to use their military might in the Mediterranean to force the governments of Arab countries to accept their dictates.

The article points out that the Arab people will not be intimidated and will not be deceived. They will never accept external dictates and will never betray their national interests. They will definitely strike back against the aggressors and their supporters.

    阿《团结报》揭露美苏勾结策划中东问题“政治解决”新骗局
    苏修是阿拉伯人民的假朋友真敌人
    阿拉伯人民决不会被吓倒，也不会被欺骗，他们必将给侵略者以坚决回击
    新华社地拉那九日电  阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》八日发表评论员文章，揭露和谴责美帝和苏修加紧勾结，支持以色列反动派，在中东问题上策划“政治解决”新骗局的险恶阴谋。
    文章指出，正当以色列侵略者继续屠杀无辜的阿拉伯人民并竭力通过白色恐怖来镇压被占领区内的巴勒斯坦爱国志士的解放运动的时候，美帝国主义者和苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者却在千方百计地用威胁和欺骗宣传，妄图使阿拉伯各国接受中东问题的所谓“政治解决”。十分明显，以色列反动派如果没有大洋彼岸的主子的援助和支持，没有对阿拉伯人民继续扮演夜间杀人、白天哭丧的角色的苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的默契，是决不敢欺压阿拉伯人民的。
    文章说，苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者口头上支持阿拉伯国家，发誓赌咒说自己是阿拉伯国家的朋友和同盟者，而实际上却在阿拉伯人民背后插上尖刀，强迫他们接受仅仅是为了满足以色列反动派要求的种种“谈判”和“解决”办法，阻碍阿拉伯人民反抗侵略者以及反抗这些侵略者的同盟者。
    文章揭露说，华盛顿和莫斯科的头目们一次又一次地抛出“解决”中东问题的“建议”，是企图使以色列侵略者得到更多的时间，以稳住他们在被占领地区的阵脚，并且削弱阿拉伯人民和巴勒斯坦爱国志士的斗争意志。同时，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者都在陈兵地中海，企图通过炫耀在地中海的武力，使阿拉伯国家的政府接受他们的意旨。
    文章指出，阿拉伯人民决不会被吓倒，决不会被欺骗。他们永远也不会接受外来的意旨，永远也不会出卖他们的民族利益，他们必将给侵略者及其支持者以坚决回击。
