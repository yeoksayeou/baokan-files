Revolutionary masses in Xining City, Qinghai Province, persist in the principle of thrifty education and establish a new type of primary school combining education with productive labor

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 7th: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, the revolutionary masses of Xinghai Road in the western district of Xining City, Qinghai Province, took the initiative to establish a primary school three years ago. This school, managed by the revolutionary masses, adheres to the principle of thrifty education and insists on the path of combining education with productive labor. Over the past three years, it has been increasingly successful and has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses.

In the autumn of 1965, the revolutionary masses of Xinghai Road decided to establish a primary school to solve the problem of some children's enrollment. At that time, they elected the director of the Xinghai Road Subdistrict Office, the director of the Residents' Committee, and the secretary of the Party branch of the nearby Yinjia Village Vegetable Production Brigade to form the Xinghai Road People's Primary School Management Committee. A female worker from the nearby Provincial Construction Company, a female member of the Yinjia Village Brigade, and three women recommended by the Subdistrict Office were appointed as teachers. They enrolled more than 150 students. The school was located in an abandoned pigsty. Teachers and students took the initiative to repair the building, level the ground, paint the walls, clean the environment, and create the appearance of a school.

The establishment of the school received enthusiastic support from the revolutionary masses in the neighborhood, nearby factories, enterprises, and institutions. Some donated funds for the school's construction, some sent desks, chairs, chalk, blackboards, paper, and ink for teaching, and some dispatched labor to help the school build toilets. In this way, the revolutionary teachers and students, with a spirit of hard work and self-reliance, established this primary school without spending a single penny of public funds.

The establishment of this people's primary school opened up opportunities for the children of revolutionary masses to attend school. Ninety-five percent of the students in this school are children of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and urban poor laborers. Enrollment is not restricted by age, region, or time; students can enroll at any time. Students can also bring their younger siblings to school. Some teenagers who need to take care of household chores during the day, or some who need to participate in productive labor during the day, the school opened night classes for them. Now, there are more than 50 students in the night class, including apprentices from neighborhood industries and housewives. The school fees are only two-thirds of those in public schools, and children from poor laboring families attend for free. In this way, some teenagers who previously had no conditions to attend public primary schools now have the opportunity to study.

Over the years, the teachers and students of this school have adhered to Chairman Mao's directive of combining education with productive labor. On the first day of the school's establishment, the first lesson was to study Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift in all undertakings. Over the years, teachers and students have insisted on participating in the productive labor of the neighborhood and the vegetable brigade. In August of this year, part of the crops in the vegetable brigade was damaged by hail, and all the teachers and students immediately went out to help, and within two days, they picked up 15 sacks of ears for the brigade, which was praised by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Due to the insistence on participating in productive labor, the teachers and students have strengthened their feelings for the laboring people and have developed a spirit of hard work and simplicity. Over the years, when the doors and windows, desks, and chairs of the school were damaged, they repaired them themselves; when the walls were damaged, they plastered them themselves. Last year, they spent only five yuan to buy lime for painting the walls. Many students have developed good habits of thrift, love for the collective, and hard work. Some students, in order to prevent the school's buckets from being lost, voluntarily brought the buckets home after school and brought them back the next morning.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the teachers and students of this school underwent the test of class struggle. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, all the teachers in the school stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and thoroughly exposed the counter-revolutionary nature of a handful of capitalist roaders within the old provincial committee. In the spring of last year, when the revolutionary masses of Qinghai Province suffered brutal persecution from the reactionary bourgeois line, the teachers and students of this primary school firmly followed Chairman Mao's words, insisted on teaching, and achieved both revolution and teaching, which was highly praised by the revolutionary masses. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the directive to establish study classes, they acted promptly and assisted the Xinghai Road Residents' Committees in establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They also often invited laboring people who had suffered deeply in the old society to give class education courses, continuously raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

The Xinghai Road People's Primary School has grown and prospered in the fierce struggle against the revisionist educational line and old habits. After the school was established, it was deprived of many political rights it should have enjoyed by some "authorities" of bourgeois education under the pretext of being "irregular." Some people in society with old ideas also looked down on the people's primary school and did not believe that "people's schools" could cultivate talents. However, the revolutionary masses' determination to run the school remained unshakable, and they sent batch after batch of children to the people's primary school. Now, this school has eight teachers and more than 300 students.

    青海省西宁市兴海路革命群众坚持勤俭办学方针
    自己动手创办教育与生产劳动相结合的新型小学
    据新华社西宁七日电　青海省西宁市城西区兴海路的革命群众，在毛主席无产阶级教育路线的指引下，三年前自己动手办起了一所小学。这所由革命群众自己管理的小学，坚持勤俭办学的方针，坚持走教育与生产劳动相结合的道路，三年来越办越好，受到了革命群众的欢迎。
    一九六五年秋季，西宁市兴海路的革命群众决定自己动手办一所小学，来解决一部分子女的入学问题。当时，他们推选兴海路街道办事处主任、居民委员会主任和附近的殷家庄蔬菜生产大队党支部书记，组成了兴海路民办小学管理委员会。由邻近的省建筑公司的一名女工、殷家庄大队选派的一名女社员和街道办事处推荐的三名妇女担任教员。共招收了一百五十多名学生。校址选择在一个废弃的养猪场里。师生们自己动手整修房子，垫平场地，粉刷墙壁，打扫环境卫生，搞出个学校的样子来。
    学校的筹建，受到了街道广大革命群众、附近工厂和企业、事业单位的热情支持。他们有的捐献建校资金，有的送来桌椅板凳，有的送来粉笔、黑板、纸张、墨水等教学用品，有的抽调劳力帮助学校修厕所。就这样，革命师生发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，没有花国家一分钱，办起了这所小学。
    这所民办小学的建立，为革命群众子女上学大开了方便之门。这个学校的学生百分之九十五以上是工人、贫下中农和城市贫苦劳动人民的子弟。入学不受年龄、地区、时间限制，随来随收。学生还可以带着自己的弟妹来上学。有些家长要上班的青少年白天要管家务，有些人白天要参加生产劳动，学校就为他们开设夜班。现在夜班有五十多个学生，其中还有街道工业的徒工和家庭妇女。学校的学费只相当于公办学校的三分之二，家庭经济困难的劳动人民子女免费上学。这样，就使以前一些没有条件进公办小学的青少年得到了上学的机会。
    几年来，这所学校的师生坚持了毛主席指示的教育与生产劳动相结合的方向。建校第一天上的第一课，就是学习毛主席关于勤俭办一切事业的教导。几年来，师生们坚持参加街道和蔬菜大队的生产劳动。今年八月，蔬菜大队一部分庄稼被冰雹打了，全校师生立即出动，两天内给队里拣回了十五麻袋穗头，受到贫下中农的称赞。由于坚持参加生产劳动，师生对劳动人民感情增强了，艰苦朴素的作风得到了发扬。几年来，学校的门窗、桌凳坏了，他们自己修；墙壁坏了，他们自己抹泥。去年一年，他们维修校舍的费用，只花了五块钱买刷墙用的石灰。许多学生养成了勤俭节约、热爱集体的好品德。有的学生为了使学校的水桶不丢失，每天放学自动把水桶带回家，第二天早上又带回来。
    这所学校的师生在无产阶级文化大革命中，经受了阶级斗争的考验。文化大革命运动初期，全校教师都站在毛主席革命路线一边，大造了旧省委内一小撮走资派的反。去年春天青海省无产阶级革命派遭到资产阶级反动路线的残酷迫害的时候，这个小学的师生坚决听毛主席的话，坚持上课，做到了革命教学两不误，深受革命群众的赞扬。伟大领袖毛主席关于办学习班的指示下达以后，他们闻风而动，协助兴海路各个居民委员会大办毛泽东思想学习班。他们还经常请在旧社会苦大仇深的贫苦劳动人民上阶级教育课，不断提高自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    兴海路民办小学是在同修正主义教育路线和旧习惯势力的激烈斗争中成长壮大。建校后，他们被一些资产阶级教育
  “权威”以所谓“不正规”为借口，剥夺了许多应该享受的政治权利。社会上一些有旧思想的人也看不起民办小学，不相信“民办”能培养出人才。但广大革命群众办校的决心毫不动摇，他们一批又一批地把娃娃送进民办小学。现在，这个学校已有八名教师、三百多名学生。
