This article advocates for urban middle schools to be primarily run by factories and primary schools to be primarily run by neighborhood committees. The author believes that the fundamental issue is implementing the correct line and path.

I believe that for urban primary schools, combining neighborhood committees, factories, and schools is more suitable for general urban situations. For middle schools, they should primarily be run by factories, with the support of the People's Liberation Army and in conjunction with communes and neighborhood committees.

During the primary school years, children have a strong desire to learn and a strong sense of responsibility. However, due to their young age, their activities are limited, and they spend most of their time at home and in the neighborhood. If urban primary schools are primarily run by neighborhood committees, students can directly participate in neighborhood study sessions, struggle meetings, and criticism meetings. They can directly participate in neighborhood class struggles, deepening their understanding of neighborhood history. This way, children can grow up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improving their class struggle and line struggle awareness, and enhancing their discernment. This also allows the Little Red Guards to fully utilize their diligent, enthusiastic, and hardworking characteristics to supervise and reform class enemies in society. Additionally, since children participate in various neighborhood activities with their parents, they will also understand their parents' political performance, which is beneficial for breaking old family concepts and promoting family and neighborhood revolutionization.

Why should urban middle schools primarily be run by factories, with the support of the People's Liberation Army and in conjunction with communes and neighborhood committees? I believe that students in the middle school stage are at a period of high energy, minimal conservatism, and rich creativity. They begin to have their own ideas and views, forming a certain degree of independence and gradually developing a correct worldview. This is a crucial period in a person's life. Therefore, it is even more necessary to strengthen proletarian education for them. Urban middle schools primarily run by factories can fully undertake this responsibility. On the other hand, looking at large, medium, and small cities across the country, I believe that running middle schools primarily through factories, in terms of manpower, resources, and finances, is not a big problem. However, if factories are to manage both middle schools and primary schools, there might be some issues. Shanghai is the city with the highest concentration of industrial workers in our country, but the number of primary and middle school students combined is more than double that of workers. If the situation in Shanghai is like this, other cities might have an even greater disparity. Therefore, it is more appropriate for middle schools to be primarily run by factories and for primary schools to be primarily run by neighborhood committees.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the working class must lead in everything. Regarding urban primary schools primarily run by neighborhood committees, some comrades are concerned about whether the leadership of the working class can be reflected. What is the leadership of the working class? I believe that first and foremost, it is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, firmly grasp class struggle, never forget two-line struggle education, and resolutely walk the socialist path. For neighborhood committees, we should see that through more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are undergoing earth-shaking changes and forming a new leadership team with industrial workers and retired workers as the main body. Such neighborhood committees themselves are under the leadership of the working class. There are also party organizations in the neighborhood committees. Urban primary schools primarily run by neighborhood committees, under the leadership of the neighborhood revolutionary committees and neighborhood party organizations, isn't this reflecting the leadership of the working class? Moreover, the worker propaganda teams have already entered urban primary schools, directly participating in school leadership and playing a leading role in the school leadership team. Isn't this the best organizational guarantee for implementing the leadership of the working class? We have the support and cooperation of the People's Liberation Army. Isn't this the strongest pillar for ensuring the leadership of the working class? Additionally, forming a teacher team mainly composed of part-time teachers from workers, peasants, and soldiers, isn't this ensuring the leadership of the working class from an ideological perspective? To implement the leadership of the working class in schools, it is not necessarily limited to whether factories directly manage them. The main thing is to see what line is being implemented and what path is being taken. Our line is Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and our path is to make students and teachers combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. I believe this is the fundamental issue.

    这篇来稿主张城市中学以工厂为主来办，小学以街道为主来办。作者认为：
    根本问题是执行什么路线走什么道路
    我觉得城市小学以街道为主与工厂、学校三结合办，中学则以工厂为主配合解放军与公社、街道结合办，比较适合一般城市的情况。
    在小学时代，孩子们求知欲强，做事有较强烈的责任感。但由于他们年龄小，活动范围比较小，一般都是在家庭和里弄的时间多，接触日常社会生活多。如果城市小学以街道为主来办，学生直接参加里弄的学习会、斗争会、批判会，直接参加里弄的阶级斗争，加深对里弄史的了解，这样可以使孩子从小就在毛泽东思想哺育下，不断提高他们的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，提高识别能力。这样又可以充分发挥红小兵办事认真、积极肯干的特点，对社会上的阶级敌人进行监督改造。同时由于孩子们与自己的家长一起参加本里弄的各种活动，孩子们对自己家长的政治表现也会有所了解，有利于打破陈旧的家庭观念，有利于家庭革命化和街道革命化。
    那么城市中学为什么要以工厂为主，配合解放军与公社、街道结合办呢？我认为，学生进入中学阶段，正是精力特别旺盛，最少保守思想，最富于创造力的时期。他们开始有了自己的一些想法和看法，有了一定的主见，开始逐步地形成正确的世界观。这是一个人一生中比较关键的时期。这就更加需要加强对他们进行无产阶级教育。城市中学以工厂为主来办，完全能担负起这一重任。另一方面，从全国各大中小城市来看，我觉得以工厂为主办中学，无论从人力、物力、财力来看，问题还是不太大的。如果工厂既要主管中学，又要主管小学的话，可能有些问题。上海是我国产业工人最集中的城市，但小学生和中学生加起来的数量是工人的一倍多。上海情况如此，其他城市可能悬殊更大。所以，中学以工厂为主来办、小学以街道为主来办比较适宜。
    毛主席教导我们：工人阶级必须领导一切。对于城市小学以街道为主来办，有的同志担心能否体现工人阶级的领导。什么是工人阶级的领导？我认为首先是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，不忘两条路线斗争教育，坚定地走社会主义道路。对于街道，我们应该看到，通过两年多的无产阶级文化大革命，也正在起着翻天覆地的变化，正在组成以产业工人、退休工人为主体的崭新的领导班子，这样的街道本身就是在工人阶级领导之下的。街道中也有党的组织，城市小学以街道为主来办，置于街道革命委员会和街道党组织的领导之下，难道就不是体现工人阶级的领导吗？况且工人宣传队目前已进驻城市的小学，直接参与学校的领导并在学校领导班子中起主导作用，这不是实现工人阶级领导的最好的组织保证吗？我们工人宣传队有解放军配合和支持，这不就是确保工人阶级领导的最强大的支柱吗？此外，再组成了以工农兵业余讲师团为主体的教师队伍，这不就从思想上确保了我们工人阶级对学校的领导吗？要实现工人阶级对学校的领导，不一定限于是否由工厂直接管理，主要是看执行什么路线，走什么道路。我们的路线是毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，我们的道路是使学校师生走与工农兵相结合的道路。我认为，这才是一个根本问题。
