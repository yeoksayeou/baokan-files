The revolutionary workers of Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant have firmly remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "thrift is revolution." Everyone takes pride in thrift and shames waste. Since this year, they have used revolutionary criticism as a driving force to continuously carry out mass thrift activities, saving a large amount of coal, electricity, steel, and timber. They have also used the saved raw materials to support the production of sister plants.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders in this plant vigorously promoted Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, advocating that "a large enterprise can afford some waste," and "as long as production goes up, a little waste is nothing." This resulted in the waste of a large amount of state resources. After the revolutionary committee took power, they continuously criticized this big-spending bourgeois style.

The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "To make our country prosperous and strong, we need several decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and opposing waste in building our country." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the plant immediately organized a specialized team to focus on thrift work and combined the specialized team with mass movements. Each workshop and team actively proposed measures and implemented them, recycling and utilizing some raw materials that were previously wasted. The steel wire workshop's steel wire is wound on wooden shafts for delivery. After delivery, the wooden shafts were discarded. Now, workers actively collect and repair these wooden shafts after delivery, saving the country 120,000 yuan annually with this alone. Previously, workers also collected waste threads used to wipe machines, squeezed out the machine oil, and reused them after processing.

Through extensive technical innovation and technological revolution, continuously tapping potential, is an important measure for Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant to carry out thrift activities. The first rolling mill's three-stand rolling, which had high labor intensity and low efficiency, was previously only innovated by a few reactionary technical "authorities" and "experts" under the capitalist roaders, and it failed after more than ten years. Now, the revolutionary committee mobilizes the masses, overcoming one difficulty after another through a 17-day struggle, successfully completing the innovation project of automatic steel feeding for the three-stand rolling's flying shear, creating conditions for rolling automation, and saving a large amount of manpower and materials. Workers used living facts to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the plant for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "expert management" and "technology first." Revolutionary criticism promoted the vigorous development of technical innovation and technological revolution throughout the plant. The first wire mill alone has reformed more than 20 processes, saving a lot of manpower and materials.

The revolutionary workers of Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, starting from the overall situation, are willing to take the trouble themselves and actively create conditions for thrift for sister plants. This year, they added a waste heat boiler to the flue of the heating furnace in the rolling mill workshop, sending the waste heat of this plant to the No. 31 Cotton Mill. The No. 31 Cotton Mill used this plant's waste heat to save half of the boiler. The workers of Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant said, things that conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, we will definitely do! We must always follow Chairman Mao's great teachings of "thrift in running factories, thrift in running stores, thrift in running all state-owned and cooperative enterprises, and thrift in running all other enterprises," and always maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of the proletariat!

    上钢二厂节约闹革命成绩显著
    节约了大量的煤炭、电力、钢材、木材，还用节约的原材料支援了兄弟厂的生产
    新华社上海十八日电　上海第二钢铁厂广大革命职工牢记伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，人人都以节约为荣，以浪费为耻。今年以来，他们以革命大批判为动力，不断开展群众性的节约活动，节约了大量的煤炭、电力、钢材、木材，还用节约的原料和材料，支援了兄弟厂的生产。
    无产阶级文化大革命前，这个厂的一小撮走资派大力推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货，胡说什么“家大业大，浪费点没啥”，“只要生产上去，浪费一点无所谓”等等，浪费了大量的国家资财。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，不断批判了这种大手大脚的资产阶级的坏作风。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”遵照毛主席的教导，厂革委会成立以后就立即组织专职队伍，负责狠抓节约的工作，并且把专业队伍和群众运动结合起来。各车间、班组积极提倡议，订措施，把以前白白浪费掉的一些原料材料，回收利用。钢丝绳车间钢丝绳是绕在木轴上出厂的，出厂后，木轴就丢了。现在，工人们主动把出厂的木轴一一回收，进行修补，单这一项，一年就可为国家节约资金十二万元。前些时候，工人们还回收擦机器的废回丝，把沾在上面的机油挤掉，经过炼制再使用。
    通过大搞技术革新和技术革命，不断挖掘潜力，是上钢二厂开展节约活动的一项重要措施。第一轧钢车间三道车，劳动强度高，效率低，过去走资派只靠几个反动技术“权威”、“专家”搞革新，搞了十几年也没有成功。现在，厂革委会广泛发动群众，经过十七天奋战，克服了一个又一个难关，终于搞成了三道车飞剪自动进钢的革新项目，为轧钢自动化创造了条件，节约了大量人力、物力。工人们用活生生的事实，狠批了刘少奇及其在本厂代理人推行“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义黑货的罪行。革命大批判推动了全厂技术革新和技术革命的蓬勃开展，仅第一钢丝车间就改革了二十多项工艺，节约了许多人力、物力。
    上钢二厂革命职工从全局出发，宁愿自己麻烦，主动为兄弟厂开展节约创造条件。今年，他们在本厂轧钢车间加热炉的烟道上，增添了一个烟道余热锅炉，把本厂烟道余热送给国棉三十一厂。国棉三十一厂利用这个厂的余热，省掉了一半锅炉。上钢二厂的工人们说，符合毛主席教导的事，我们就是坚决干！毛主席关于“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业”的伟大教导，我们就是要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，天天干，月月干，年年干，永远保持和发扬无产阶级的优良传统！（附图片）
    辽宁省凤城县化肥厂利用旧材、废料，经过反复研究试验，终于成功地改革了“考克兰”锅炉，使功效提高了百分之七十，成本降低了百分之四十，为国家节省了开支，为农业多产了化肥。图为驻该厂解放军同志和工人一起研究关于要进一步节约闹革命的问题。新华社稿
