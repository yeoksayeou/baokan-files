Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "One line, one viewpoint, must be frequently and repeatedly spoken about." The same applies to Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies; they must also be frequently and repeatedly spoken about.

To frequently and repeatedly speak about them, we must first raise the issue to the level of the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao's proletarian policies are the concrete embodiment of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The attitude towards Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies is the attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian policies without any deviation is to concretely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Conversely, if one does not implement or carry out the Party's policies, or even does something else, it is to promote the reactionary bourgeois "multi-centerism."

To frequently and repeatedly speak about them, we must also raise the issue to the level of transforming one's worldview. Chairman Mao's proletarian policies have a very clear class character. Only by establishing a firm proletarian worldview can one deeply understand and correctly carry out these policies. If one carries out policies with various selfish motives, problems and deviations will arise. Some comrades seek stability and fear chaos, fearing to make mistakes and not daring to mobilize the masses; some comrades prefer to be "left" rather than "right," saying that being right is a mistake in stance, while being left is only a mistake in method. These are all reflections of the bourgeois worldview. The bourgeois worldview will inevitably hinder the implementation of proletarian policies. Only by continually breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in the struggle, and transforming one's worldview, can one correctly understand and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies.

To frequently and repeatedly speak about them, it is not enough to speak to a few people; one must speak to the broad revolutionary masses. One must "turn the Party's policies into the actions of the masses." Proletarian policies represent the highest interests of the broad laboring people and have the most extensive and profound mass base. Once these policies are grasped by the masses, they will become a great material force. Only when the policies are directly grasped by the masses and the masses maintain a high level of revolutionary vigilance, can they timely expose and smash the sabotage of the class enemy from the right or "left" side, and can the proletarian policies be correctly implemented. Directly giving the Party's policies to the masses, combining the struggle between the two lines within the Party and the revolutionary mass movement, is in line with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Conversely, not trusting the masses, thinking that the masses "cannot grasp the policies," and mystifying the Party's policies, is to go against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Many cadres within the Party have one-sided views on strategic issues and, as a result, swing between 'left' and 'right.' They must understand the changes and development of the Party's policies from the past to the present in a comprehensive and unified manner to overcome this." We must continue to deeply carry out the study movement on the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, learn from the experiences and lessons of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and continually enhance our awareness of carrying out Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. "Now the enemy has been thoroughly isolated. However, the isolation of the enemy does not mean our victory. If we make mistakes in our policies, we still cannot achieve victory." We must study Chairman Mao's series of proletarian policies more diligently, propagate them repeatedly, and carry them out resolutely, fully unleashing the mighty power of Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies, fighting the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛主席的无产阶级政策要经常讲反复讲

    毛主席最近教导我们：“一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。”对于毛主席的各项无产阶级政策，同样也要经常讲，反复讲。
    要经常讲，反复讲，首先要提到两条路线斗争的高度来讲。毛主席的无产阶级政策，是毛主席革命路线的具体体现。对待毛主席的各项无产阶级政策的态度，就是对待毛主席革命路线的态度。不折不扣地执行毛主席的无产阶级政策，就是具体地贯彻毛主席的革命路线，这是忠于毛主席革命路线的重要标志。反之，对党的政策不贯彻、不执行，甚至另搞一套，就是搞反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”。
    要经常讲，反复讲，还要提到改造世界观的高度来讲。毛主席的无产阶级政策，有着极其鲜明的阶级性。只有树立了牢固的无产阶级世界观，才能深刻地理解它，正确地执行它。带着形形色色的私心杂念去执行政策，就会闹问题、出偏差。有的同志求“稳”怕“乱”，怕犯错误而不敢放手发动群众；有的同志宁“左”勿右，说右是立场错误，“左”只是方法问题。这些都是资产阶级世界观的反映。资产阶级世界观必然阻碍无产阶级政策的贯彻执行。只有在斗争中不断地破“私”立“公”，改造世界观，才能正确理解、坚决执行毛主席的各项无产阶级政策。
    要经常讲，反复讲，只给少数人讲不行，要给广大革命群众讲。要“把党的政策变为群众的行动”。无产阶级的政策，代表了广大劳动人民的最高利益，有着最广泛最深厚的群众基础。它一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。也只有直接为群众所掌握，使群众不断保持高度的革命警惕性，及时识破和粉碎阶级敌人从右的或“左”的方面来的破坏，无产阶级的政策才能正确地贯彻执行。把党的政策直接交给群众，使党内两条路线斗争和革命群众运动相结合，才符合毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。反之，不相信群众，认为群众“掌握不了政策”，把党的政策“神秘化”，搞“孤家寡人主义”，则是和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线背道而驰的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“党内许多干部对于策略问题上的片面观点和由此而来的过左过右的摇摆，必须使他们从历史上和目前党的政策的变化和发展，作全面的统一的了解，方能克服。”我们必须继续深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，从党内两条路线斗争的历史中吸取经验教训，加深对毛主席在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的理解，不断增强执行毛主席各项无产阶级政策的自觉性。
    无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性胜利。“现在敌人已经彻底孤立了。但是，敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”我们一定要更加勤奋地学习、反复地宣传、坚决地执行毛主席一系列无产阶级政策，充分发挥毛主席各项无产阶级政策的强大威力，打好斗、批、改这一仗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
