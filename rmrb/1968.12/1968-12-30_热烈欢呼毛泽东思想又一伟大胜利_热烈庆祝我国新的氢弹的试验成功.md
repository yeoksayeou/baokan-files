The entire nation of a billion people is jubilant, pointing out that China's new leap in nuclear weapons development has greatly boosted the morale of the world's revolutionary people and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Just as the entire nation of a billion revolutionary people, under the great inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, are advancing with high spirits to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are preparing to welcome the Ninth National Congress of the Party and the even greater year of 1969 with a combative posture, the joyous news of the successful test of China's new hydrogen bomb has arrived. The revolutionary masses across the nation are overjoyed and are holding celebratory activities, warmly celebrating China's new leap in nuclear weapons development, warmly celebrating another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and warmly celebrating another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability; they will surely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." The revolutionary masses, while celebrating the successful test of China's new hydrogen bomb, enthusiastically point out: China's new leap in nuclear weapons development has greatly boosted the morale of the world's revolutionary people and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. They declare: Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, we will raise higher the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, strive to accomplish the tasks of the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation as proposed by Chairman Mao, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and courageously struggle to build our great socialist motherland even stronger, making new contributions to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

Last night, the joyous news spread to every corner of the country, and cities and villages were filled with excitement. People repeatedly shouted: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" Millions of revolutionary masses came out from factories, mines, villages, stations, ports, offices, and schools, carrying giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding high red flags, clutching revolutionary books, beating drums and gongs, setting off firecrackers, braving the cold wind and snow, parading and celebrating, with slogans and cheers echoing through the night. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chengdu, and other major cities saw workers and revolutionary masses parading and celebrating until late into the night, and today, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people held even larger-scale celebratory activities. In the capital, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses braved the snow today, surging towards the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party to report the good news, and gathering at Tiananmen Square to celebrate. Many people, in this moment of happiness, danced in the snow to celebrate Chairman Mao's longevity.

The joyous news reached the border regions of the motherland, and people of all ethnic groups enthusiastically shouted in different languages: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" The capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi, was filled with excitement, and people of various ethnic groups such as Uygur, Kazakh, Hui, and Han repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" The revolutionary people in the Ili Valley, on the frontline against revisionism, braved temperatures of minus thirty degrees to hold celebratory gatherings. Last night, the sound of drums and gongs echoed through the streets of Lhasa all night long. The first generation of workers in Tibet celebrated the success of China's new hydrogen bomb test as another blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. In the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, people of all ethnic groups braved heavy snow today to hold a celebratory rally and parade. Last night at midnight, in the frontline city of Nanning supporting Vietnam against America, more than sixty thousand people of various ethnic groups held a celebratory rally. The revolutionary masses on the border of Yunnan enthusiastically declared: We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and build the thousand-mile border into an iron wall.

Shijiazhuang, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Changchun, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and other cities held rallies with tens of thousands to twenty thousand participants today. Nanjing, Taiyuan, Jinan, Hefei, Nanchang, Harbin, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Guiyang, Xining, and other cities saw continuous celebratory parades throughout the day. In the place where the red sun rises—Hunan Shaoshan, the heroic sons and daughters today came in batches to Mao Zedong's former residence to hold celebratory parades. Representatives attending the conference of active learners and appliers of Chairman Mao's works in Chiping, Jian, heard the good news and some representatives immediately crossed mountains and valleys at night, running more than thirty miles to tell the poor and lower-middle peasants. Old revolutionary commander Zhou Wenkai of Daping Village excitedly said: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Following you gives us boundless strength and wisdom; following you brings happiness and victory!

The entire crew of the Chinese ship "Yongning" sailing in the Indian Ocean, upon hearing the joyous news of the successful test of China's new hydrogen bomb, could not help but shout repeatedly: "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" They specially sent a telegram from overseas to pay tribute to the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, scientists, and all related personnel who participated in the research and testing of nuclear weapons!

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, becoming an atomic bomb of unparalleled power." Revolutionary masses across the country, while celebrating the success of this hydrogen bomb test, with boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, excitedly said: We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we can create any miracle. Zhang Meihua, a responsible person of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory Revolutionary Committee and a famous mirror grinding expert, said: The success of the new hydrogen bomb test is a powerful criticism of the "crawling philosophy" of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. It fully proves that the scientific judgment made by the great leader Chairman Mao in 1958 that "to make some atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, I think it is completely possible in ten years" is extremely wise and correct. The militiamen of Guozhuang Brigade, Guozhuang Commune, Wuxi County, Hebei, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on carrying out people's armed struggle, participated in more than three hundred battles during the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, dealing heavy blows to the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits. After hearing the great news, they once again studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, highly praising Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The militiamen excitedly said: We have Mao Zedong Thought, we have Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and we are invincible. Imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Metao, an active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought from Hongqing Village, Taicang County, Jiangsu, said: We must thoroughly purge the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought forever arm our minds, becoming revolutionaries forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Revolutionary masses unanimously declared: We must learn from the workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, scientists, and all related personnel in our country who are engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons, raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strive to accomplish the tasks of the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation as proposed by Chairman Mao, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary masses, with the joy of victory, emphasized: China's successful test of the new hydrogen bomb has once again struck a blow to the nuclear threats and nuclear blackmail policies of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, greatly encouraging and supporting the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end, and the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. While celebrating the victory, the broad masses also pointed out: China's necessary and limited nuclear tests and development of nuclear weapons are purely for defense, to break the nuclear monopoly, and ultimately to eliminate nuclear weapons. We must continue to raise high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, together with the revolutionary people of the world and the countries that maintain independence and love peace, strive for the lofty goal of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, naval, and air forces are filled with the joy of victory, warmly celebrating China's successful test of a new hydrogen bomb, warmly celebrating another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and warmly celebrating another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They declared: We must learn from our comrades who are engaged in the research and testing of China's nuclear weapons, raise higher the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and advance bravely in the great struggle to defend socialist motherland and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The joyous news of China's successful test of the new hydrogen bomb spread, and the entire army was filled with excitement. From military camps to border outposts, airports, ships, battlefields, everywhere was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and firecrackers. "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao longevity! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" The cheers echoed across the vast land of the motherland. In the capital, the leaders of the various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Office, various military branches, and the Beijing Military Region, together with the broad masses of soldiers and officers, held celebratory gatherings, parades, and discussions through the night, bravely celebrating China's new leap in nuclear weapons development. The soldiers of the long-distance communication unit immediately connected all lines at the fastest speed upon hearing this heart-stirring news, transmitting the good news to comrades across the army. Soldiers and officers participating in the conference of the Four Good Units of the Air Force, Artillery, Railway Corps, and Beijing Military Region, and the exchange of experiences of the Three Supports and Two Militaries of the Navy, were extremely excited upon hearing this news by Chairman Mao's side. Some of them, holding high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," braved the snow at night, rushing to Tiananmen Square and Zhongnanhai to report the good news; some of them beat victory drums and danced in front of Chairman Mao's giant statue, celebrating Chairman Mao's longevity. Representatives from the "Good Four Stations on Kunlun Mountain" of the Air Force proudly said while celebrating the victory: "With the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we can climb any scientific peak and create any miracle on earth!"

The joyous news reached the troops in Nanjing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Jinan, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Lanzhou, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions, and various units also held celebratory gatherings and parades through the night. Many units stationed on the border and coastal frontlines immediately used the fastest methods to spread the good news of China's successful test of a new hydrogen bomb to the nearby mountain villages and fishing villages upon hearing the broadcast. A company of a certain border defense unit on the banks of the Dulong River in Yunnan held a celebratory parade and then immediately lit torches, entering the Dulong ethnic villages to knock on doors and report the good news. Soldiers and officers stationed at a certain border post in the northern part of the motherland braved the snow for ten miles at night, bringing the good news to the Orogen ethnic mountain village, and together with the poor hunters of the Orogen ethnic group, sang and danced through the night, repeatedly shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

A ship relies on its helmsman to navigate, and a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. While warmly celebrating the success of this new hydrogen bomb test, soldiers and officers of various units held discussion meetings and experience-sharing meetings, highly praising another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, the success of this hydrogen bomb test is the result of comrades engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons, raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They were able to make a material hydrogen bomb because they grasped Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible person of a certain unit's medical department, who was awarded the honorable title of "Advanced Medical Department Serving the People Wholeheartedly," combined their successful experience of removing a ninety-pound tumor from the abdomen of female community member Zhang Qiuhua, and enthusiastically talked about the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for achieving all victories. With Mao Zedong Thought arming the minds of the people across the country, any miracle can be created. Combat hero Mai Xiande, a flight vice squadron leader of a certain unit of the Air Force who had been awarded military merits, said, in the past, we relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to defeat the enemy; today, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we successfully conducted a new hydrogen bomb test. This fully demonstrates the unparalleled power of Mao Zedong Thought. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought grasped by seven hundred million Chinese people, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies!

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, crawling step by step behind others. We must break the conventions and adopt advanced technology as much as possible, and in a not-too-long historical period, build our country into a modernized socialist power." With great excitement, the broad masses of soldiers and officers highly praised the success of this new hydrogen bomb test as a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, and other industrial and mining enterprises and scientific research units, soldiers and officers supporting the left, together with workers and revolutionary masses, seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "crawling philosophy" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. They said, we must follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao that "the working class must lead everything," fully play the leading role of the working class, thoroughly purge the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and make contributions to accelerating the development of China's national defense science and technology and achieving the modernization of China's national defense.

People's Liberation Army heroes guarding the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist frontlines, while warmly celebrating the success of the new hydrogen bomb test, angrily denounced the criminal acts of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism conspiring to re-divide the world. They pointed out that China's successful test of the new hydrogen bomb has once again struck a blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, greatly encouraging and supporting the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end, and the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. The broad masses of soldiers and officers, with high morale, declared: We must raise higher the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines, "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," further consolidate national defense, and make new contributions to defending the great socialist motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, welcoming the victorious convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.
