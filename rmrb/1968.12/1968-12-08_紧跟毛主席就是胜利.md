The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Nan Cui Zhuang Brigade of Anyang County, Ying Ju Brigade of Fengqiu County, Qi Li Ying Commune of Xinxiang County, and Guang Kuo Tian Di Da You Zuo Gong She Commune of Jiong County, Henan Province, studied Chairman Mao's latest directive with great excitement: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be frequently and repeatedly expounded. It is not enough to expound it to a small number of people; it must be made known to the broad masses of the revolutionary people." They linked this directive with the facts of the intense struggle between the two lines in their own areas and conducted a thorough study of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. In the course of their study, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in these areas enthusiastically praised the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's leadership, enthusiastically praised the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and conducted a thorough criticism of the heinous crimes of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi in his frenzied promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside. They further raised their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They said: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the red line leading to communism. To follow Chairman Mao closely is victory! Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is a black line aimed at restoring capitalism, making the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice and undergo double misery. This black line must be thoroughly criticized and stamped out, so that it can never rise again! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to wage a resolute struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, to carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation thoroughly, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!
