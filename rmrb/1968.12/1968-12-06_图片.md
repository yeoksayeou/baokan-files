The PLA propaganda team stationed in Lanzhou, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, enthusiastically assists the poor and lower-middle peasants in organizing various types of study classes on Chairman Mao's works. They implement the various combat tasks outlined in the communiqué, further igniting a new high tide in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in light of the new situation. This is a scene from a family study class at the home of poor peasant Aunt Cheng, where soldiers are studying Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with the new situation.
