We have conducted some preliminary explorations into the question of who should run urban primary schools. From our practice, we have come to feel that in areas with factories, it is a good and feasible approach for urban primary schools to be run by factories, with neighborhood committees and rural people's communes collaborating in management. This ensures the implementation of Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." Under the domination of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, bourgeois intellectuals held sway over school education, and students became more and more revisionist, not understanding what class is or what class struggle is. Some students even developed bourgeois ideas of looking down on workers and peasants, despising labor, indulging in comfort, and pursuing fame and fortune. One of our students, whose ancestors were all poor peasants, used to participate in labor while studying in the countryside. After moving to the city to study for a few years and returning to the countryside, he would not go near the pigsty and would not eat steamed buns. In the fields, he would pull out wheat seedlings thinking they were weeds. His grandfather, seeing this, was both heartbroken and indignant: "After studying in the city for a few years, he has forgotten his roots. If he studies a few more years, he will become a young master or miss!" We deeply feel that the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause must be cultivated by the working class, and proletarian schools must be led by the working class.

Having urban primary schools run by factories can firmly grasp the power of education in the hands of the working class, fully implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools.

Having urban primary schools run by factories, with neighborhood committees and communes collaborating in management, is beneficial for fully implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." Under the leadership of the working class and with the strong support of neighborhood committees and communes, we have established a "May 7th" workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and neighborhood activists lecture team. Together with in-service teachers, we study teaching content and formulate educational plans to cultivate students with Mao Zedong Thought. We have also established bases for learning from workers and peasants, organizing students to participate in the three great revolutionary movements. This way, students not only learn production knowledge and cultivate a labor attitude but also deepen their class feelings with the laboring people, and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. Some students who originally wanted to go to middle school, university, and eventually become famous and successful now love factories and the countryside.

Having urban primary schools run by factories, with neighborhood committees and communes collaborating in management, is also beneficial for integrating school education, family education, and social education, and for integrating the education of school-aged children and preschool children. With the strong support and help of neighborhood committees, we have organized school-aged children into companies, platoons, and squads based on their residential areas, and formed company committees consisting of teachers, Little Red Guards, and neighborhood activists. We invite retired old workers and neighborhood activists to be instructors, organizing students' extracurricular activities such as holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, participating in neighborhood struggle, criticism, and transformation, etc., so that students receive great education and tempering. We have organized 1,305 preschool children to form 154 preschool Mao Zedong Thought study classes, where Little Red Guards teach them to study Chairman Mao's quotations, sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, participate in neighborhood struggle meetings, and do good deeds on the streets, etc.

    工厂办学，街道和人民公社配合管理
    落实毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示有了保证
    我们对城市小学应该由谁来办的问题，进行了一些初步的探索。从实践中我们体会到，在有工厂的地区，城市小学由工厂来办，街道和农村人民公社配合管理的办法是比较好的，也是切实可行的。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的统治下，资产阶级知识分子把持学校教育大权，学生越学越修，根本不懂得什么是阶级，什么是阶级斗争。有些学生还沾染了轻视工农，轻视劳动，贪图安逸，追求名利等资产阶级思想。我校有个学生，祖辈几代都是贫农，在农村上学时还经常参加劳动，进城读了几年书，再回到农村，不沾猪圈边，不吃窝窝头，到了地里把麦苗当草拔。他爷爷看了又心疼又气愤地说：“进城读了几年书，把老根儿都忘了，再读几年还不成了少爷小姐！”我们深深体会到，无产阶级革命事业接班人必须由工人阶级来培养，无产阶级的学校必须由工人阶级来领导。
    城市小学由工厂来办，就可以把教育大权牢固地掌握在工人阶级手里，全面贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。
    城市小学由工厂来办，街道、公社配合管理，有利于全面落实毛主席的“五·七”指示。在工人阶级领导、街道和公社的大力支持下，我们建立了有工人、贫下中农、街道积极分子参加的“五·七”工农兵讲师团，按照工人阶级的需要，和在职教师一起研究教学内容，制定教育计划，用毛泽东思想培养学生。我们还建立了学工、学农基地，组织学生参加三大革命实践，使学生不仅学到了生产知识，培养了劳动观点，而且进一步加深了与劳动人民之间的阶级感情，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。有些学生原来想的是升中学，上大学，将来成名成家，现在他们爱上了工厂、农村。
    城市小学由工厂办，街道和公社配合管理，也有利于把学校教育、家庭教育和社会教育结合起来，把在校学生和学龄前儿童教育结合起来。在街道的大力支持和帮助下，我们已经按居住地区把在校学生组成连、排、班，并由教师、红小兵和街道积极分子组成连委会。请退休老工人和街道积极分子当辅导员，组织学生的校外活动，如举办毛泽东思想学习班，参加街道上的斗、批、改等等，使学生受到了很大的教育和锻炼。我们组织了一千三百零五名学龄前儿童，成立了一百五十四个幼儿毛泽东思想学习班，由红小兵教他们学习毛主席语录，唱毛主席语录歌，参加街道上的批斗会，在街道上做好事等等。
