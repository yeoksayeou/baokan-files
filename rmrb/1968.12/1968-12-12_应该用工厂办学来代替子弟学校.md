After reading the "How Should Primary and Secondary Schools in Cities Be Run?" special discussion article published in the People's Daily, we believe that running schools through factories and assigning schools to specific factories is in line with the socialist direction. However, while doing so, the original "schools for children of employees" must be abolished.

The "primary schools for children of employees" originally belonging to certain enterprises and institutions use the superior conditions of their own units to establish a "hereditary" education system, which does not conform to the socialist direction of education. Therefore, schools run by factories should not be confused with the original "schools for children of employees." It seems that replacing "schools for children of employees" with schools run by factories is also an aspect of the educational revolution.

    应该用工厂办学来代替子弟学校
    读了《人民日报》发表的“城市的小学及中学应当如何办？”的专题讨论文章后，我们认为工厂办学、定厂定校办学是符合社会主义大方向的。但在这样办的同时，必须取消原来的“子弟学校”。
    原来属于某些企业、事业单位的“子弟小学”，利用本单位的优越条件，搞“世袭”式的教育制度，它不符合社会主义办学的大方向。因此，绝不能把工厂办的学校与原来的“子弟学校”混同起来。看来，用工厂办的学校来代替“子弟学校”，也是教育革命的一个方面。湖北省军区政治部　时学东
