"Voice of the Thai People" Radio Calls for Farmers to Mobilize Under the Leadership of the Thai Communist Party
Intensify Armed Struggle to Overthrow the U.S.-Thai Reactionary Regime
Only by Overthrowing U.S. Imperialism, Feudalism, and Bureaucratic Capitalism Can Thai Farmers Achieve Liberation

Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 12th, stating that Thai farmers can only achieve liberation by mobilizing and organizing under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, resolutely engaging in revolutionary armed struggle, driving out American aggressors, and overthrowing the Sarit-Thanom traitorous regime.

The article states that the land issue is the fundamental problem for farmers. U.S. imperialism, the Sarit-Thanom clique, and evil landlords collude to seize farmers' land for their own use or to build military bases, strategic roads, and various military facilities, causing more and more farmers to lose their means of livelihood and become destitute. According to the U.S.-Sarit-Thanom clique, currently, 85% of Thai farmers are landless or lack land, while most of the land is in the hands of a small group of American-Sarit-Thanom clique members and landlords who only care about sucking the blood and sweat of the farmers.

The article states that hired farmers and tenant farmers suffer from brutal labor and rent exploitation. In central Thailand, the average rent is as high as 85% of the harvest. Farmers cannot make a living and have to borrow money to get by, thus falling victim to usury. Currently, loan interest rates can be as high as 200% to 300%.

The article points out that U.S. imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalists are the three mountains oppressing Thai farmers. The Sarit-Thanom-Bahol reactionary government is the representative of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalists. U.S. imperialism and the Sarit-Thanom clique collude to further oppress and exploit, causing deep suffering for the farmers. Thai farmers urgently need to overthrow these three mountains.

The article points out that the Thai Communist Party proposes to gradually abolish the feudal exploitation system, reduce rent and interest, cancel all unreasonable debts, and carry out land reforms according to local conditions, allowing farmers to have land to make a living. These policies fully align with the fundamental interests of the farmers and are enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of farmers.

The article states that under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, Thai farmers resolutely wage people's war, fundamentally shaking the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Sarit-Thanom clique.

    “泰国人民之声”电台号召农民在泰共领导下动员组织起来
    加紧武装斗争推翻美泰反动统治
    只有推翻美帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山，泰国农民才能得解放
    新华社十五日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十二日广播一篇文章指出，泰国农民只有在泰国共产党领导下，充分动员组织起来，坚决进行革命武装斗争，赶走美国侵略者，推翻他侬—巴博卖国政权，才能够取得解放。
    文章说，土地问题是农民的根本问题。美帝国主义、他侬集团和恶霸地主，相互勾结抢夺农民的土地，据为己有，或用以修建军事基地、战略公路和各种军事设施，使越来越多的农民失去谋生的土地，倾家荡产。据美国—他侬集团透露，目前，泰国农民有百分之八十五无地或缺地，而大部分土地却落在一小撮只顾吸吮农民血汗的美国—他侬集团和地主手里。
    文章说，雇农和佃农遭受到残酷的劳役和地租剥削。在泰国中部，平均地租高达收成的百分之八十五。农民无法过活，须借债度日，从而又要受到高利贷的剥削。目前，贷款利息有的高达百分之二百到百分之三百。
    文章指出，美帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本家是压在泰国农民头上的三座大山。他侬—巴博反动政府是封建主义和官僚资本家的总代表。美帝国主义和他侬集团相互勾结，变本加厉的压迫和剥削，造成农民的深重灾难。泰国农民迫切要求推翻压在他们头上的这三座大山。
    文章指出，泰国共产党提出有步骤地废除封建剥削制度，减租减息，取消一切不合理的债务，根据各地情况进行土地革命，让农民有谋生土地等政策，完全符合农民的根本利益，受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。
    文章说，泰国农民在泰共领导下，坚决进行人民战争，从根本上动摇了美国—他侬集团的反动统治。
