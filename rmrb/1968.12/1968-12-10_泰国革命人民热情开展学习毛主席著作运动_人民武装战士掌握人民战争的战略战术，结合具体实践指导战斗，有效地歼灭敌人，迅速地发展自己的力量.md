The Thai revolutionary people are actively responding to the call of the Communist Party of Thailand and are enthusiastically launching a movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

The radio station said: "A ship in the vast ocean needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The Communist Party of Thailand, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leads the Thai people in their armed revolutionary struggle against the U.S. imperialist invaders and the Thanom-Prapas sellout clique. Under the leadership of the CPT, the movement to study Chairman Mao's works is widely carried out among the Thai revolutionary people, and Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses.

The radio station further said: Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the "Three Articles," are increasingly being mastered by the broad masses of the Thai revolutionary people and are used as weapons to transform their worldviews. This has given the CPT members, cadres, armed fighters, and revolutionary people a revolutionary spirit of overturning the heavens and the earth, fearing neither hardship nor death. They persist in using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work, pushing the revolutionary struggle forward.

The radio station said that within the people's armed forces, the soldiers enthusiastically study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to establish a spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people, and a spirit of fighting to liberate the country and the people. They actively study Chairman Mao's military works, mastering Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics for people's war, combining them with specific practices to guide battles, effectively annihilating the enemy, and rapidly expanding the people's armed struggle to 31 provinces. The people's armed forces have become an invincible and powerful armed force.

The radio station pointed out that as the movement to study Chairman Mao's works continues to deepen, the CPT members, cadres, armed fighters, and revolutionary people deepen their love for Chairman Mao Zedong and their limitless faith in Mao Zedong Thought.

The radio station finally emphasized that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, once the broad revolutionary masses grasp the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, they will possess boundless power, be able to overcome any obstacle, defeat the U.S. imperialist invaders and their lackeys, the Thanom-Prapas sellout clique, and ultimately liberate the country and the people, achieving true independence and democracy.

    电台说，在人民武装队伍里，战士们热情地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来树立完全、彻底为人民服务的精神，树立为解放国家和解放人民而战斗的精神。他们积极学习毛主席的军事著作，掌握毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，结合具体实践指导战斗，有效地歼灭敌人，使人民武装斗争迅速地扩展到三十一个府。人民武装已成为不可战胜的强大武装队伍。
    电台指出，由于学习毛主席著作运动的不断深入，泰共党员、干部、人民武装战士和革命人民加深对毛泽东主席的热爱，无限信仰毛泽东思想。
    电台最后强调指出，在泰国共产党领导下，泰国广大革命群众，一旦掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想这一武器，就会具有无穷的力量，就能战胜任何障碍，就能战胜美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团，最后一定能够解放国家和人民，赢得真正的独立和民主。
