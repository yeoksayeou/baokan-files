	The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to use the economic power of Japanese monopoly capital to further promote the comprehensive restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, has recently become even more brazen in colluding with the Japanese reactionaries, eagerly selling off the natural resources of Siberia and the Soviet Far East.

	According to reports, the Soviet revisionist clique and Japanese monopoly capital held the third meeting of the "Japan-Soviet Economic Joint Committee" from December 6th to 11th in Tokyo and issued a joint statement on the 11th. During the meeting, the Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly begged the Japanese monopoly capital to "help develop" the natural resources of Siberia and the Soviet Far East, selling out national sovereignty and the interests of the Soviet people, fully exposing their treacherous faces.

	The Soviet revisionist clique sent a delegation led by the first deputy minister of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade, I. F. Semichastnov, consisting of 30 people, to attend the third meeting of the "Japan-Soviet Economic Joint Committee." At the opening ceremony of the meeting on the 6th, this Soviet revisionist deputy minister shamelessly said that the relationship between the Soviet revisionist clique and the Japanese reactionary ruling clique had "deepened" "mutual trust," which was a "good example" of the "principle of coexistence." He also fawned, saying that the Soviet revisionist clique "hoped" that "no matter what happens in the future," the relationship between the Soviet revisionist clique and the Japanese reactionary ruling clique could "develop smoothly." He also eagerly expressed that the Soviet revisionist clique would not hesitate to sell out national sovereignty to help Japanese monopoly capital plunder the natural resources of Siberia and the Soviet Far East, opening the door wide.

	According to reports, the Soviet revisionist clique auctioned off the natural resources of Siberia and the Soviet Far East to Japanese monopoly capital at this "Japan-Soviet Economic Joint Committee," including natural gas, pulpwood, and coal and iron sand.

	According to the _Asahi Shimbun_, the Soviet revisionist clique, at this meeting, especially begged the Japanese monopoly capital to "develop" the natural gas in Sakhalin and Yakutsk. The Soviet revisionist clique expressed its willingness not only to provide natural gas from these regions to Japan but also proposed laying a pipeline from Sakhalin to Japan's Hokkaido.

	At this meeting, the Soviet revisionists also begged Japanese monopoly capital to help them renovate the ports in the Soviet Far East, selling off national sovereignty to Japanese monopoly capital. For this purpose, a special committee composed of both Soviet and Japanese sides will be established to "specifically negotiate" the port issues in the entire Soviet Far East region. The Soviet revisionists have agreed to invite a Japanese delegation to renovate the ports to the Soviet Union.

	Currently, while the Soviet revisionist clique is hastening to collude with U.S. imperialism, it is eagerly engaging in so-called "economic cooperation" with the Japanese reactionaries, who are lackeys of U.S. imperialism. They do not hesitate to sell out national sovereignty and national interests, opening the door wide for Japanese monopoly capital to surge into the Soviet Union. This can only more clearly expose their counter-revolutionary, anti-people traitor faces to the people of the world.

    借日本垄断资本的经济力量进一步推动资本主义的全面复辟
    苏修集团丧权辱国大肆拍卖自然资源
    最近“日苏经济联合委员会”会议上，苏修代表再次低声下气乞求日本垄断资本“帮助开发”西伯利亚和远东地区资源，出卖国家主权和人民利益，充分暴露了叛徒的丑恶嘴脸
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：苏修叛徒集团为了用日本垄断资本的经济力量进一步推动苏联的资本主义全面复辟，最近更加变本加厉地与日本反动派进行勾结，竭力拍卖西伯利亚和苏联远东地区的自然资源。
    据报道，苏修叛徒集团与日本垄断资本从本月六日到十一日在东京举行了“日苏经济联合委员会”第三次会议，并在十一日发表了联合公报。会议期间，苏修叛徒集团不惜丧权辱国，百般乞求日本垄断资本集团“帮助开发”西伯利亚和苏联远东地区的自然资源，出卖国家主权和苏联人民的利益，完全暴露了它们的丑恶的叛徒嘴脸。
    苏修叛徒集团为出席“日苏经济联合委员会”第三次会议，派出了由苏联对外贸易部第一副部长伊·费·谢米恰斯特诺夫率领的包括三十个人的庞大代表团。这个苏修副部长在六日举行的“日苏经济联合委员会”第三次会议的开幕式上，竟恬不知耻地说什么苏修集团和日本反动统治集团之间“加深”了“相互信赖关系”，这是“符合”“共处原则”的“好榜样”。他还献媚地说，苏修集团“期望”，“将来不管发生怎样的情况”，苏修集团和日本反动统治集团的“关系”“能够顺利发展”，并且竭力表示，苏修集团将不惜出卖国家主权，为日本垄断资本掠夺西伯利亚和苏联远东地区的自然资源，大开方便之门。
    据报道，苏修叛徒集团在这次“日苏经济联合委员会”上，向日本垄断资本拍卖的西伯利亚和苏联远东地区的自然资源，包括天然气、纸浆木材、以及煤和铁砂等。
    据《朝日新闻》报道，苏修叛徒集团在这次会议上，特别恳求日本垄断资本集团“开发”库页岛和雅库次克的天然气。苏修集团表示，它不仅愿意从这些地区向日本提供天然气，并且建议铺设一条从库页岛到日本北海道之间的管道。
    在这次会议上，苏修还乞求日本垄断资本帮助它整顿苏联远东地区的港湾，把这些国家主权也出卖给日本垄断资本。为此，将成立由苏日双方组成的专门委员会，对整个苏联远东地区的港湾问题进行“具体协商”。苏修已答应邀请日本派遣一个整顿港湾的代表团到苏联。
    苏修叛徒集团目前在加紧与美帝国主义进行勾结的同时，竭力与美帝走狗日本反动派大搞所谓“经济合作”，不惜出卖国家主权和民族利益，为日本垄断资本涌入苏联大开门户，这只能在全世界人民面前更加清楚地暴露它的反革命、反人民的叛徒真面目。
