In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Heping County, Xindianzhu Commune, Xigouzi Production Brigade, a "primary school with a cap" agricultural middle school was established. The poor and lower-middle peasants took control of the school. At this time, a handful of class enemies emerged to spread poisonous winds, saying, "Peasants have no culture, no knowledge. Illiterate people running the school can't do it well." The poor and lower-middle peasants immediately struck back at the class enemies, saying: "We'll do as Chairman Mao says. We don't know how to read, so we'll tell the children why we can't read and why we need to study, so that the children will never forget their roots and always be loyal to Chairman Mao."

One day, old poor peasant Zhang Pinghai gave a lecture to the students. The topic was: Why do we need to study? Grandpa Zhang, tears in his eyes, said: I am a person who has experienced the old society. At that time, how the poor people wanted to study for a few days! But we had no right to study. Today, you have this right. This is given to you by the great leader Chairman Mao and by the poor and lower-middle peasants. What is the purpose of letting you study? Is it to become officials as the great traitor Liu Shaoqi advocated? Absolutely not! It is to better serve socialist construction, to firmly grasp the reins of power of the proletariat, and to ensure that our socialist state will never change color. Saying this, Grandpa Zhang shifted his gaze to the faces of more than ten graduating students and continued: We must study for the revolution, study for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The countryside needs you so much! Think about it, can the production team do without a cadre who studies Chairman Mao's works? Can it do without an accountant? These jobs, should we not let socially conscious, educated poor and lower-middle peasants do them? Should we let those literate landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists do them? No, absolutely not!

As soon as Grandpa Zhang finished speaking, more than ten graduating students stood up, facing the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and solemnly swore: Chairman Mao, we will definitely follow your words, resolutely take the road of integrating with workers and peasants, and take root and blossom in the vast countryside.

The students who stayed in school expressed their determination to study for the revolution and become cultured laborers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

    我们要为革命读书
    内蒙古自治区和林县新店子公社西沟子大队，自己办了一所“小学戴帽”的农业中学。贫下中农掌管了学校的大权。这时，一小撮阶级敌人钻出来刮阴风，说什么：“庄户人没文化，没知识，瞎汉管学校，管不好。”贫下中农立即给阶级敌人以迎头痛击，他们说：“毛主席咋说咱咋办。咱不识字，就给娃娃们讲不识字的原因，讲为啥要念书，让娃娃们永远不忘本，永远忠于毛主席。”
    一天，老贫农张平孩给学生们讲课，课题是：为什么要念书。张大爷热泪盈眶地说：我是旧社会过来的人，那时穷人多么想念几天书啊！但是，咱们没有念书的权利。今天你们有了这个权利，这是伟大领袖毛主席给的，是贫下中农给的。让你们念书到底为了什么呢？是象大叛徒刘少奇鼓吹的“读书做官”吗？绝对不是！是为了更好地为社会主义建设服务，牢牢掌握咱们无产阶级的印把子，使我们的社会主义江山永不变色。讲到这里，张大爷把目光移到十几名应届毕业生的脸上，接着说：我们要为革命读书，为贫下中农读书。农村多么需要你们呀！你们想想，生产队没有学习毛主席著作辅导员行吗？没有记工员、会计行吗？这些，不让有社会主义觉悟的有文化的贫下中农去干，难道让那些识文断字的地富反坏右分子去干吗？不能，绝不能！
    张大爷的话音刚落，十几名应届毕业生呼地站了起来，面对着伟大领袖毛主席画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，庄严宣誓：毛主席呀，毛主席！我们一定听您的话，坚决走同工农结合的道路，在农村这个广阔的天地中生根开花。
    留校的同学们表示要为革命读书，做无限忠于毛主席的有文化的劳动者。
