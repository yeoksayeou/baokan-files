A Traitorous Face

	Beijing Foodstuffs General Factory Military Representative Guo Xiande
	Worker Zhang Honglin
	Beijing Wireless Equipment Machinery Factory Worker Li Huiming

	The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, is a traitor, spy, and traitorous element buried within the Party. He is a criminal who has committed countless sins and is a running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang.

	The reactionary film "Visit to Indonesia" is a major exposure of the traitorous face of Liu Shaoqi.

	In 1963, the class struggle both domestically and internationally was extremely sharp and intense. The revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people was thriving, with revolutionary forces growing stronger and the revolutionary situation looking very good. The U.S. imperialists and the Indonesian reactionaries were in cahoots, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle and maintain their shaky rule. It was at this time that the great traitor Liu Shaoqi rushed to Indonesia, using the pretext of a "visit" to actually betray the Indonesian revolution. On the one hand, he was rubbing shoulders with the reactionary military clique leaders like Nasution, shaking hands and chatting warmly, wishing these executioners to "take care of their health." On the other hand, he urged the Indonesian people to strengthen "national unity with Nasakom as the core," deceiving the Indonesian people into abandoning armed struggle and taking the "parliamentary road."

	It's not surprising at all. Liu Shaoqi is a "parliamentary fanatic." As early as 1946, he had shouted, "The main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has shifted from armed struggle to parliamentary struggle," "We need to know how to propagate, how to speak, how to campaign for elections, and get everyone to vote for you," "We need to go into office"...

	More than ten years later, this great traitor Liu Shaoqi, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Chinese people, rushed to Indonesia again, acting as a trumpeter for the "parliamentary road," opposing the Indonesian people's armed struggle.

	The traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates the "parliamentary road," wanting the Indonesian people to wait for the "grace" of the reactionaries, to go "peacefully" to "socialism" under the leadership of the bourgeoisie, empty-handed and unarmed.

	The traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates the "parliamentary road," which means not allowing slaves to rebel, wanting the Indonesian people to willingly accept exploitation and oppression forever, generation after generation, as the slaves of the bourgeoisie reactionaries.

	The traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates the "parliamentary road," which is to weaken the strength of the Communist Party, consolidate and strengthen bourgeois dictatorship, boost the morale of the reactionaries, and dampen the spirit of the revolutionary people.

	The great traitor Liu Shaoqi's criminal activities in Indonesia fully expose his treacherous face of following the Soviet revisionist clique, supporting the Indonesian reactionaries, and suppressing the Indonesian revolution. It fully proves that he is in cahoots with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, just like Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, a great traitor who betrays the international workers' movement.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The bloody lessons of the Indonesian revolution further prove that oppressed nations and peoples, if they want to smash the shackles on their bodies and achieve revolutionary victory, must steadfastly follow the armed struggle road indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao. "The whole world can only be changed with the gun." Without the gun, there is no position for the proletariat; without the gun, there is no position for the people; without the gun, there is no position for the Communist Party; without the gun, there is no revolutionary victory. The revolutionary people take up the gun, and they can "sweep away all harmful creatures and have no enemies."

    一副工贼嘴脸

    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派刘少奇，是一个埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼，是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗。
    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》，是刘少奇工贼面目的一次大暴露。
    一九六三年，国内、国际阶级斗争异常尖锐、激烈。印尼人民革命斗争蓬勃发展，革命力量日益壮大，革命形势一片大好。美帝国主义和印尼反动派狼狈为奸，企图扑灭印尼人民革命斗争的烈火，维持其摇摇欲坠的统治。就在这时，大工贼刘少奇跑到印度尼西亚，借“访问”之名，行出卖印尼革命之实。他一方面和印尼反动军人集团头目纳苏蒂安之流眉来眼去，握手言欢，打得火热，并祝愿这帮刽子手“保重身体”。另一方面，他要印尼人民加强“以纳沙贡为核心的民族团结”，欺骗印尼人民放弃武装斗争，走“议会道路”。
    说起来，这并不奇怪。刘少奇是个“议会迷”。早在一九四六年，他就叫嚷过什么：“中国革命的主要斗争形式，已由武装斗争形式转向议会斗争形式”，“要会作宣传，会演说，会作选举运动，要大家投你的票”，“要去做官”……。
    十几年以后，这个双手沾满中国人民鲜血的大工贼刘少奇，又跑到印度尼西亚，充当“议会道路”的吹鼓手，反对印尼人民走武装斗争的道路。
    工贼刘少奇鼓吹“议会道路”，就是要印尼人民等待反动派的“恩典”，赤手空拳地在资产阶级领导下，“和平过渡”到“社会主义”。
    工贼刘少奇鼓吹“议会道路”，就是不许奴隶造反，要印尼人民心甘情愿地永远受剥削受压迫，世世代代做资产阶级反动派的牛马。
    工贼刘少奇鼓吹“议会道路”，就是为了削弱共产党的力量，巩固和加强资产阶级专政，大长反动派的威风，大灭革命人民的志气。
    大工贼刘少奇在印尼的罪恶活动，充分勾划出他追随苏修叛徒集团，为印尼反动派帮腔，镇压印尼革命的反革命嘴脸，充分证明他是和帝、修、反穿一条连裆裤，和苏联赫鲁晓夫一样，是一个出卖国际工人运动的大工贼。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。印尼革命人民血的教训，更证明了被压迫的民族和人民，要想砸烂身上的枷锁，取得革命的胜利，只有坚定不移地走伟大领袖毛主席所指引的武装斗争的道路。“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”没有枪杆子，就没有无产阶级的地位；没有枪杆子，就没有人民的地位；没有枪杆子，就没有共产党的地位；没有枪杆子，就没有革命的胜利。革命人民拿起枪杆子，就能“要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌”。
