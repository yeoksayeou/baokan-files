The counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line has many rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are like iron chains that lock us, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, outside the school gates. Just take our brigade as an example. In the nineteen years since liberation, many landlord and rich peasant children have graduated from this school and that school, watching them fly high and far, while many children of poor and lower-middle peasants cannot go to school. Some production teams can't even find an accountant. Why is it so easy for landlord and rich peasant children to enter school? Why is it so difficult for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enter school? The fundamental reason is that the revisionist educational line controls the schools, and the bourgeois intellectuals control the schools. They want to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie, so it is naturally difficult for us, the poor and lower-middle peasants, to go to school.

To implement the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line, various obstacles are set up to restrict the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from entering school. The ringleader is the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. He blabbers about how "the excellent ones go to the first category, and those who are a bit less go to the second category." The "excellent ones" that Liu Shaoqi talks about are distinguished according to his revisionist standards. He wants to cultivate spiritual aristocrats and successors of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the ones he selects to go to the "first category" are first and foremost from exploitative class families and will never include the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Liu Shaoqi sets the tone, and the bourgeois intellectuals who control the schools understand it well. Thus, they set even more and more specific rules and regulations to restrict the children of laboring people from entering school.

The sinister and cunning traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, whose heart is more poisonous than a snake's, not only promotes "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" in the countryside, attempting to restore capitalism and make us poor and lower-middle peasants become slaves again, but also promotes the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line to cultivate spiritual aristocrats, intending to forever ride on top of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Liu Shaoqi is our sworn enemy.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals controlling our schools can no longer continue." Chairman Mao has spoken the words in our hearts, the poor and lower-middle peasants. Following this brilliant directive from Chairman Mao, we have broken through the blockade of the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line and established the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" Agricultural School, Wugang Branch, Lidiba Study Class in Yanzhou County, where poor and lower-middle peasants choose their own children to attend. The students put studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts at the forefront and emphasize the connection between theory and practice. Therefore, a batch of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is growing vigorously. Based on our several years of experience in running schools, I deeply feel that to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, the primary issue is to seize the educational power from the bourgeois intellectuals and not let the bourgeois intellectuals lead us by the nose.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao has again taught us: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." This is Chairman Mao's greatest support and trust in us, the poor and lower-middle peasants. We not only need to run our own "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" Agricultural School Study Class well but also need to manage the brigade's agricultural middle school and primary school well. We must fully mobilize the masses, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line to eliminate its poison. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will definitely be able to manage the schools well according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

    冲破修正主义教育路线的封锁
    “抗大”农校学员　吴华荣
    反革命修正主义教育路线，有许多条条框框。这些条条框框，就象一把把铁锁，把我们贫下中农子女锁在校门外面。就拿我们大队来说，解放十九年来，许多地主、富农子女陆续从这个学校毕业，从那个学校毕业，眼看着他们一个个远走高飞了，而许多贫下中农子女却上不了学。有个别的生产队连个会计都挑不出来。为什么地主、富农子女入学那么容易？为什么贫下中农子女入学那么困难？最根本的原因就是修正主义教育路线统治着学校，资产阶级知识分子统治着学校，他们要培养资产阶级的接班人，当然我们贫下中农上学就困难了。
    推行反革命修正主义教育路线，设置种种障碍来限制贫下中农子女入学，罪魁祸首就是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。他胡说什么“优秀的上第一类，次一些的就进入第二类”。刘少奇所说的“优秀的上第一类”是按照他的修正主义标准来区别的，他是要培养精神贵族，培养资产阶级接班人。所以他选择“优秀的上第一类”的，首先是剥削阶级家庭出身的人，决不会把贫下中农子女排列在内。刘少奇定下这个调子，统治学校的资产阶级知识分子心领神会，于是定下了更多、更具体的限制劳动人民子女入学的条条框框。
    罪恶累累的美帝、苏修和国民党的走狗刘少奇，心比毒蛇还毒。他不光在农村推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”，妄想复辟资本主义，叫我们贫下中农重新做牛做马，还推行反革命修正主义教育路线，培养精神贵族，企图永远骑在我们贫下中农头上。刘少奇是我们贫下中农的死对头。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席说出了我们贫下中农心里话。按照毛主席这个光辉指示，我们冲破了反革命修正主义教育路线的封锁，办起了邗江县“抗大”农校汊河分校立坝学习班，由贫下中农选择自己的子女入学。学员把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位，重视理论联系实际。因此，一批无产阶级革命事业的接班人正在茁壮地成长。根据我们几年来办学的实践，我深深地体会到，要培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，首要的问题就是要从资产阶级知识分子手里夺回教育大权，不让资产阶级知识分子牵住我们的鼻子。
    最近，伟大领袖毛主席又教导我们：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”这是毛主席对我们贫下中农最大的支持和信任。我们不仅要把自己办起来的“抗大”农校学习班办好，而且要把大队的农中和小学管理好。我们一定要充分地发动群众，深入地开展革命大批判，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，肃清其流毒。我们贫下中农按照毛主席的教导办事，完全有把握把学校管理好。
