In the face of the surging tide of the world's revolutionary movements, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, like the U.S. imperialists, is in deep crisis and unprecedented isolation, fully exposing its paper tiger's weak essence.

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, under the impact of the surging tide of the world's revolutionary movements, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, like the U.S. imperialists, is having a harder time, falling into a situation of internal and external difficulties, contradictions, and unprecedented isolation, fully exposing the weak essence of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique as a paper tiger.

For a long time, the modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has been riddled with contradictions and crises. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, while colluding with the U.S. imperialists and competing with them, has consistently pursued a policy of great power chauvinism and national selfishness, turning Eastern European revisionist countries into their vassal states and colonies, constantly tightening their control over the ruling cliques of these countries, and ruthlessly oppressing and exploiting the broad masses of the people in Eastern European countries. Some Eastern European revisionist cliques, out of their own interests, have tried to break free from Soviet control, while others have attempted to directly align themselves with the imperialist countries led by the U.S.

	Four-Way Split, Disintegration
	Chaos in the Revisionist Camp

The struggle between the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and the revisionist ruling cliques of Eastern European countries over control and counter-control has intensified, and disintegration has accelerated. In August of this year, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique brazenly sent troops to militarily occupy Czechoslovakia, which was the result of the extreme sharpening of internal contradictions within the modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and the result of the U.S.-Soviet collusion to attempt to redivide the world.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's military occupation of Czechoslovakia declared the complete bankruptcy of Soviet modern revisionism. The naked aggression of the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique is a shocking exposure of their insane pursuit of imperialist hegemony.

In the past few months, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia has sparked resistance from the Czechoslovakian people, opposition from the Soviet people, and condemnation from revolutionary people around the world. At the same time, within the entire modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, chaos has erupted, leaving the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique in unprecedented isolation and disarray. Despite the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's efforts to extricate themselves from this predicament, deploying a large number of leaders, even Brezhnev and Kosygin themselves, running around, using all sorts of counter-revolutionary tactics, and pulling and pressuring their revisionist partners, the four-way split within the revisionist clique has not only not been reversed but has instead worsened. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, after years of careful planning, decided to hold a counter-revolutionary black meeting of the revisionist clique in Moscow in November-December of this year, but due to the intensification of disagreements within the revisionist clique, it was once again declared a failure.

Thus, the already fragmented modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has fallen into an even more disintegrated state this year.

	Rats Crossing the Street, Everyone Shouts to Beat Them
	The Soviet Revisionist Clique Faces Criticism from All Sides

In the past year, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's collusion with U.S. imperialism against the world's people has been strongly condemned by the people of the world, making them a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat them.

In this year, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has blatantly pursued a policy of social imperialism, colluding with and competing with the U.S. imperialists, attempting to redivide the world.

With the tacit approval and support of the U.S., the Soviet revisionist traitor clique sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia, while the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in turn, tacitly approved and supported the U.S. imperialists' unrestrained invasion of Vietnam, intensifying their dirty political deals with the U.S. imperialists to help them extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique also colluded with the U.S. imperialists in the Middle East issue, eagerly peddling the so-called "political solution" scam, plotting to strangle the anti-imperialist and anti-aggression struggles of the Arab people. Due to their shared anti-China and counter-revolutionary needs, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique also reached one shameful deal after another with the U.S. imperialists on issues such as the so-called "non-proliferation treaty," "nuclear protection," and various issues related to strengthening bilateral "cooperation" between the Soviet Union and the U.S., thus pushing the counter-revolutionary criminal collusion of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world" to a new stage.

However, the more the Soviet revisionist traitor clique tries to be counter-revolutionary, the more they expose themselves. Their series of criminal activities have played a good role as a negative example for the people of the world, leading to a new upsurge in the struggles of the revolutionary people of various countries against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

Since this year, the Palestinian people and the people of other Arab countries have issued statements and held massive demonstrations, firmly opposing the conspiracy of "political solution" to the Middle East issue plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia, sabotage of the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people, and collusion with the U.S. imperialists to create the "non-proliferation" big scam have also ignited the anger of the revolutionary people. People angrily denounced "Soviet revisionism is new colonialism," "Russia and the United States are birds of a feather," "U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are the vicious enemies of the people of the world." In many places, demonstrations and marches against Soviet revisionism were held, making the new tsars of the Kremlin infamous and very embarrassed.

In this year, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in collusion with the U.S. imperialists, conspired with the reactionaries of Japan, India, Indonesia, and other countries to continue to form an anti-China "encirclement," and gathered various ghosts and demons from around the world to carry out evil anti-China activities, attempting to isolate China and sow discord between the Chinese people and the people of other countries. "How can an ant shake a tree?" Their evil intentions will never be realized, and they will never be realized. After more than two years of tempering through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, socialist China has gained unprecedented prestige among the people of the world, especially among the broad masses of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been even more widely spread throughout the world. This has made all the evil anti-China conspiracies of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique suffer a humiliating failure.

	Crises, Internal Instability
	The Soviet Revisionist Clique's Days Are Hard

Within the Soviet Union, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique also faced numerous difficulties this year, making their days even harder.

This year, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has taken a series of new measures to accelerate the full restoration of capitalism, pushing the so-called "new economic system" based on capitalist profit principles into all aspects of economic life on a large scale. In agriculture, the Soviet revisionist clique has even implemented a new so-called "land legislation principle," openly destroying the original Soviet land nationalization system and further supporting the economy of the rich peasants and capitalist forces in the countryside. Under these circumstances, phenomena such as free competition, profit-seeking, anarchic production, and chaotic supply and marketing relationships inherent in capitalist economics have become even more serious in various sectors of the national economy this year. As a result, the growth rates of production and labor productivity in industry have been declining month by month and quarter by quarter, agricultural production has been very sluggish; market supply has become even tighter, and prices have been rising continuously.

For many years, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has consistently tried to deceive the Soviet people with fabricated so-called economic "achievements" and "victories" in the construction of communism. This year's bleak economic situation and difficulties in the Soviet Union have once again led to the bankruptcy of the Kremlin's propaganda of deception. At the same time, the new retrogressive actions of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to restore capitalism have further intensified the exploitation and oppression of the Soviet working people from all aspects, aggravated the crisis of mass unemployment, and deepened social class divisions. Thus, the class contradictions between the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other laborers in the Soviet Union and the small group of bourgeois privileged classes and their political agents, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, have become even more intense this year.

Under these circumstances, the infighting within the Soviet ruling clique has also become even more intense this year. They are engaged in fierce struggles, blaming and shifting responsibility to each other in the face of various insurmountable difficulties. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique's attempt to maintain the "stability" within the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is no longer possible. The several Central Committee plenary sessions held by the Soviet Central Committee this year, which repeatedly emphasized the issue of "unity" and "consistency" within the Soviet revisionist party, reflected their internal struggles.

	Deception Fails, Repression Bankrupts
	The Broad Masses Are Increasingly Awakening

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in order to maintain its reactionary rule and ease the increasingly sharp class contradictions at home, has racked its brains. Since this year, they have repeatedly convened meetings from the Soviet Central Committee to local party organizations, as well as various specialized meetings throughout the Soviet Union and the various republics, repeatedly discussing the issue of "strengthening ideological work," attempting to further strengthen control and repression over the Soviet people. They have turned on all the propaganda machines, trying to make the Soviet working people maintain "unity" with the Soviet ruling clique, shouting about the need to strengthen "iron discipline" and "self-discipline" among the Soviet people, and to make people become obedient tools of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique. Fearing that the "turmoil" in some Eastern European countries at the end of last year and the beginning of this year would spread to the Soviet Union, since April of this year, Brezhnev and other Soviet revisionist big and small leaders have even personally gone to various places in the Soviet Union to "explain the situation," attempting to control the situation. At the same time, they have taken measures this year to further strengthen the police machinery and impose naked fascist rule on the Soviet people.

However, all the struggles of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique have only exposed their reactionary rule's weakness and ferocious exterior, exposing the sharp class contradictions and class struggles within the Soviet Union, and are absolutely unable to reverse the historical trend of the Soviet people's opposition to modern revisionism. After this year, the Soviet people have become more politically awakened. Now, more and more Soviet revolutionary people have seen through the essence of social imperialism and social fascism of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, recognizing that revisionism is the root of all the disasters of the Soviet people. More and more true revolutionaries have grown this year and have engaged in various forms of struggle against the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, opposing this group of great traitors and great betrayers in restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, imposing bourgeois dictatorship on the broad masses of the people, and colluding with U.S. imperialism internationally, madly opposing China, communism, the people, and revolution. They are determined to carry out a second revolution to end the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The "Stalin Group" issued a call a few months ago: "Overthrow the dictatorship of the bourgeois degenerationist clique! Join the battle to rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union!" This fully reflects the heroic spirit and determination of the Soviet proletariat to carry out a proletarian revolution.

	Internal and External Difficulties, No Way Out
	The Soviet Revisionist Clique's Days Are Numbered

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Imperialism is strong on the outside but weak on the inside because it lacks the support of the people." "The internal contradictions of the imperialist system are numerous and insurmountable, making the imperialists fall into great anguish." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, which has degenerated into social imperialism, is now in a state of great turmoil and unable to extricate itself from the numerous insurmountable contradictions at home and abroad. At present, they are still using their so-called "great power status" and fake "communism" to eke out a living in the international arena and within the Soviet Union, but the Soviet people are increasingly opposing them, and the revolutionary people of the world are increasingly opposing them, making their days very difficult.

"The seas are turbulent with clouds and water, and the five continents are shaken by wind and thunder." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, sitting on a revisionist ship full of holes, is absolutely unable to escape the fate of ultimate destruction.

    社会帝国主义面目大暴露　现代修正主义总破产
    苏修叛徒集团内外交困矛盾重重
    在世界人民革命运动汹涌澎湃的浪潮冲击下，苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义一样，深陷危机，空前孤立，充分暴露出它的纸老虎的虚弱本质
    据新华社二十八日讯　本社记者报道：在世界人民革命运动汹涌澎湃的浪潮的冲击下，苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义一样，日子越来越不好过，陷入了内外交困，矛盾重重，空前孤立的窘境，充分暴露了苏修叛徒集团纸老虎的虚弱本质。
    长期以来，以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义集团内部矛盾重重，危机四伏。苏修叛徒集团在同美帝加紧勾结又互相争夺的情况下，一贯奉行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义政策，把东欧修正主义国家变为他们的附庸国和殖民地，不断加紧对这些国家的统治集团的控制，对东欧国家广大人民实行残酷的压迫和剥削。东欧的一些修正主义集团则出于它们自身利害的考虑，极力想摆脱苏修的控制，有的则企图直接同以美帝为首的帝国主义国家挂钩。
    四分五裂，分崩离析
    现修集团一片混乱
    在苏修叛徒集团同东欧国家的修正主义统治集团之间控制和反控制的斗争越演越烈，分崩离析日益加剧。今年八月间，苏修叛徒集团悍然出兵武装占领捷克斯洛伐克，就是以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义集团之间内部矛盾极度尖锐化的结果，是美苏勾结妄图重新瓜分世界引起的结果。
    苏修叛徒集团对捷克斯洛伐克实行军事占领，宣告了苏联现代修正主义的总破产。勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团这一赤裸裸的侵略行径，是他们疯狂推行帝国主义强权政治的狰狞面目的空前大暴露。
    几个月来，苏修武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克激起了捷克斯洛伐克人民的反抗，引起了苏联人民的反对，遭到了全世界革命人民的谴责。同时，在以苏修叛徒为中心的整个现代修正主义集团内部闹得一片混乱，使勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团空前孤立，狼狈不堪。尽管苏修叛徒集团为摆脱这种困境，不惜出动大批头目，甚至勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流亲自出马，东奔西跑，耍尽反革命两面手法，对其修正主义伙伴又拉又压。但是，修正主义集团内部四分五裂的局面，不仅没有扭转，相反却越来越恶化。苏修叛徒集团经过几年苦心经营，决定于今年十一——十二月在莫斯科举行修正主义集团的反革命黑会，也由于修正主义集团内部分歧加剧，而又一次宣告破产。
    这样，本已支离破碎的以苏修为中心的现代修正主义集团，在今年就陷入了更加分崩离析的境地。
    过街老鼠，人人喊打
    苏修集团四面楚歌
    在过去的一年里，苏修叛徒集团加紧勾结美帝国主义反对世界人民的罪恶行径，遭到全世界人民的强烈谴责，已经成为过街老鼠，人人喊打。
    在这一年里，苏修叛徒集团赤裸裸地推行社会帝国主义政策，同美帝相互勾结，相互争夺，妄图重新瓜分世界。
    在美帝的默许和支持下，苏修出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，而苏修反过来又默许和支持美帝放手侵略越南，加紧同美帝进行肮脏的政治交易，帮助美帝扑灭越南人民的革命烈火。苏修还同美帝狼狈为奸，在中东问题上竭力兜售所谓“政治解决”的骗局，阴谋扼杀阿拉伯人民反帝反侵略的斗争。出于反华、反革命的共同需要，今年苏修还同美帝在所谓“防止核扩散条约”、提供“核保护”等问题上，以及有关加强苏美两国双边“合作”的许多问题上，达成了一笔又一笔的可耻交易，从而把“美苏合作主宰世界”的反革命罪恶勾当推进到一个新的阶段。
    然而，苏修叛徒集团越是要反革命，就越是暴露了他们自己。他们这一系列罪恶活动，对世界人民来说，起到了很好的反面教员的作用，使各国革命人民反对美帝苏修的斗争出现了新高潮。
    今年以来，巴勒斯坦人民和其他阿拉伯国家的各阶层人民，接连发表声明，举行声势浩大的游行示威，坚决反对美苏合伙策划的“政治解决”中东问题的阴谋。
    在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，苏修武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克、破坏越南人民的革命斗争、伙同美帝制造“防止核扩散”大骗局等罪行，也激起了革命人民的怒火。人们愤怒地斥责“苏修是新殖民主义”、“俄国和美国是一丘之貉”、“美帝和苏修是全世界人民的凶恶敌人”，不少地方举行了反对苏修的示威游行，使克里姆林宫的新沙皇声名狼藉，十分狼狈。
    在这一年里，苏修叛徒集团伙同美帝，勾结日本、印度、印尼等国反动派，继续拼凑反华“包围圈”；并纠集国际上形形色色的牛鬼蛇神，大搞反华罪恶勾当，妄图孤立中国，挑拨中国人民和世界各国人民的关系。“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，他们的这些恶毒目的，不可能达到，而且永远不会达到。经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的社会主义中国，在世界各国人民，特别是在亚非拉各国广大人民中的威信，一年来得到了空前的提高，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界得到了更加广泛的传播。这使苏修叛徒集团的一切反华罪恶阴谋，遭到了可耻的失败。
    危机重重，内部不稳
    苏修集团日子难熬
    在苏联国内，苏修叛徒集团今年同样处于重重困难的煎熬之中，日子越来越不好混了。
    今年，苏修叛徒集团加紧采取一系列加速全面复辟资本主义的新措施，大规模地把以资本主义利润原则为核心的所谓“新经济体制”推广到经济生活一切环节中去。在农业方面，苏修集团竟然实行了一项新的所谓“土地立法原则”，公开破坏苏联原来的土地国有制，进一步扶植富农经济和农村的资本主义势力。在这种情况下，国民经济各部门中，资本主义经济所固有的自由竞争、唯利是图、生产的无政府状态、供销关系混乱等现象，在今年就变得更加严重。结果，造成工业中生产和劳动生产率的增长率逐月逐季下降，农业生产十分不景气；市场供应进一步紧张，物价不断上涨。
    多年来，苏修叛徒集团一贯企图用虚构的所谓经济“成就”和“共产主义建设”的“胜利”来蒙蔽苏联人民。今年苏联国民经济的一片凄惨景象和困难局面，使克里姆林宫这一帮政治骗子的这些蛊惑性宣传又一次遭到破产。同时，苏修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的新的倒行逆施，从各方面进一步加重了对苏联劳动人民的剥削和压榨，加剧了工人大量失业的危机，加深了社会的阶级分化。这样，苏联广大的工人、农民和其他劳动者同苏联一小撮资产阶级特权阶层及其政治上的代理人苏修统治集团之间的阶级矛盾，在今年就进一步激烈起来。
    在这种情况下，苏修统治集团内部狗咬狗的争吵，在今年也闹得更凶。他们面对种种无法克服的困难，进行着激烈的明争暗斗，相互指责和推卸责任。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团要想维持苏修统治集团内部的“稳定”，是再也办不到了。苏修中央今年一连召开的几次中央全会，极力强调苏修党内“团结”和“一致”的问题，就反映了他们内部的争吵。
    欺骗失灵，镇压破产
    广大人民日益觉醒
    苏修叛徒集团为了维持自己的反动统治，缓和国内日益尖锐的阶级矛盾，简直是绞尽了脑汁。今年以来，他们多次召开从苏修中央到地方党组织的会议，以及全苏联和各共和国的各种专门会议，一再讨论所谓“加强意识形态工作”的问题，企图进一步加强对苏联人民的控制和镇压。他们开足了一切宣传机器的马力，竭力要苏联劳动人民同苏修统治集团保持“团结”，叫嚷要在苏联人民中加强什么“铁的纪律”和“自觉的纪律”，要人们作勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的驯服工具。由于担心去年年底和今年以来一些东欧国家中的“动荡”传染到苏联，从今年四月以来，勃列日涅夫等苏修大小头目，甚至多次亲自出马，跑到苏联各地“作解释工作”，企图控制局势。同时，他们今年还采取措施，进一步加强了警察机器，对苏联人民实行赤裸裸的法西斯统治。
    然而，苏修叛徒集团的这一切挣扎，除了暴露了他们反动统治的虚弱和色厉内茬，暴露了苏联国内尖锐的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争以外，是绝对扭转不了苏联人民反对现代修正主义的历史潮流的。经过这一年，苏联人民政治上进一步觉醒了。现在，有越来越多的苏联革命人民认清了苏修叛徒集团的社会帝国主义和社会法西斯主义的本质，认识到了修正主义是苏联人民一切灾难的根源。越来越多的真正的革命者在这一年里得到了进一步的成长，并同苏修叛徒集团展开了各种形式的斗争，反对这伙大工贼、大叛徒在苏联国内复辟资本主义，对广大人民实行资产阶级专政，在国际上勾结美帝国主义，疯狂反华、反共、反人民、反革命的罪行。他们决心要进行第二次革命，结束苏修叛徒集团的反动统治。“斯大林小组”几个月前发出号召：“打倒资产阶级蜕化分子集团的专政！投身到重建苏联无产阶级专政的战斗中去！”这就充分表现了苏联无产阶级的英雄气概和进行无产阶级革命的决心。
    内外交困，走投无路
    苏修集团寿命不长
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。”“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”已经堕落成为社会帝国主义的苏修叛徒集团，今天已经被国内外无法克服的重重矛盾搞得焦头烂额，难以自拔。目前，他们虽然还在利用自己的所谓“大国地位”和假“共产主义”在国际上和苏联国内苟延残喘，但是，苏联人民越来越反对他们，世界革命人民越来越反对他们，他们的日子难过得很。
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”坐在千疮百孔的修正主义破船上的苏修叛徒集团，是绝对无法逃脱最后覆灭的命运的。
