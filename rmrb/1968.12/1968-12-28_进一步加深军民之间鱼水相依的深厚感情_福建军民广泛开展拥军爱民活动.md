Fujian soldiers and civilians extensively carry out activities to support the military and love the people

Soldiers and civilians jointly declare: We must strengthen our preparedness for war, be ready at any time to annihilate any enemy that dares to invade, and be ready at any time to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan, to achieve new merits for the people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 27th: The 17 million revolutionary people and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian coastal defense frontline, with boundless proletarian affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the military and love the people." They extensively carried out activities to support the military and love the people, further deepening the deep affection between soldiers and civilians like fish and water.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The broad revolutionary masses on the Fujian coastal defense frontline have, through more than two years of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply understood this unshakable great truth. Broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards enthusiastically, in various military-civilian joint celebrations and discussions, used numerous facts to praise the great People's Liberation Army, personally created by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, and praised the three services' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the great achievements they have established in "three supports and two militaries." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen along the coast say, the People's Liberation Army is our bosom friend. Every victory we achieve in our revolution and production is soaked with the blood of the People's Liberation Army. They are truly Chairman Mao's good soldiers and the people's children.

The boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought closely ties the frontline soldiers and civilians together. They use Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage each other and move forward together. On the island of Tongxin, far from the mainland, a 77-year-old fisherman, Madam Zheng Muxiang, heard that new soldiers had arrived on the island and was very happy. She put on her old patched clothes and carried a basket of seaweed to the new soldiers, recounting the bitter life of coastal fishermen in the old society. She then cooked the seaweed and had a meal with the new soldiers. Madam Zheng and the new soldiers encouraged each other with Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle." The new soldiers were deeply moved by Madam Zheng's care and vowed to always keep their guns ready to defend the great socialist motherland for life. The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive, "The experience of history is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture only a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know it," reached the frontline. The poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen of the frontline commune immediately thought of the soldiers guarding the island day and night. They quickly wrote Chairman Mao's latest directive on red paper, carrying lanterns, drums, and gongs to deliver it to the island-defending soldiers. The soldiers guarding the island, upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, immediately thought of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the frontline commune. They also brought Chairman Mao's latest directive and hurriedly came to meet them. They met on the way and were especially affectionate. They immediately held a discussion on the spot, sharing their understandings of studying Chairman Mao's latest directive.

"When soldiers and civilians unite as one, who in the world can be our enemy?" Currently, the activities to support the military and love the people on the Fujian coastal defense frontline are thriving. The broad revolutionary masses are earnestly learning from the People's Liberation Army's spirit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, adhering to the four firsts, and promoting the three-eight style. They proactively and enthusiastically help the People's Liberation Army do the "three supports and two militaries" work well. The soldiers and officers of the frontline army, navy, and air force repeatedly go deep into the masses, hold military-civilian heart-to-heart talks, and extensively solicit the opinions of the revolutionary masses. They are determined to do the "three supports and two militaries" work better and more vigilantly guard the country's thousand-mile coastal defense. After the publication of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué, the frontline three services dispatched thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into factories, villages, offices, and schools, studying the communiqué with the broad masses and implementing the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué. The frontline soldiers and civilians jointly declare that they must deeply carry out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, burn the fire of revolutionary criticism even more fiercely, raise their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, earnestly implement the tasks of each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; they must strengthen their preparedness for war, be ready at any time to annihilate any enemy that dares to invade, and be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan, to achieve new merits for the people.

    进一步加深军民之间鱼水相依的深厚感情
    福建军民广泛开展拥军爱民活动
    军民共同表示：一定要加强战备，随时准备消灭一切胆敢来犯的敌人，随时准备解放我国的神圣领土台湾，为人民立新功
    据新华社福州二十七日电　福建海防前线一千七百万革命人民和人民解放军指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，积极响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，广泛开展拥军爱民活动，进一步加深了军民之间鱼水相依的深厚感情。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”福建海防前线的广大革命群众，从两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，更深刻地体会到这一颠扑不破的伟大真理。广大工人、贫下中农、革命干部和红卫兵小将，怀着无比激动的心情，在各种军民联欢会、座谈会上，用大量事实歌颂了伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的、林副主席直接指挥的伟大的人民解放军，歌颂了前线三军无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在“三支”“两军”中建立的丰功伟绩。沿海广大贫下中农和渔民说，人民解放军是我们的贴心人。我们革命和生产中取得的每一个胜利，都渗透了人民解放军的心血，他们不愧是毛主席的好战士，人民的子弟兵。
    对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的无限热爱，把前线军民紧紧地联系在一起。他们用毛主席的教导来互相鼓舞，共同前进。在远离大陆的同心岛上，七十七岁的渔民老大娘郑木香，听说岛上来了新战士，非常高兴，就穿上她在旧社会的补丁打上补丁的破衣服，提着一篮海草，前来向新战士们控诉沿海渔民在旧社会的苦难生活，并且把带来的海草煮了，和新战士们一起吃了顿忆苦饭。老大娘和新战士们用毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导来互相勉励。新战士们对郑木香的关怀非常感动，表示一定要时刻紧握手中枪，为保卫伟大的社会主义祖国站一辈子岗。伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示传到前线，前沿公社的贫下中农和民兵立即想起日夜守卫在岛上的解放军战士。他们马上把毛主席的最新指示抄在红纸上，提着灯，敲锣打鼓去送给守岛战士。驻守海岛的指战员听到毛主席的最新指示后，也马上想起前沿公社的贫下中农，他们也带着毛主席的最新指示连夜赶来。双方在路上相遇，格外亲热，他们就地召开了座谈会，畅谈学习毛主席最新指示的体会。
      “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”目前，福建海防前线军民的拥军爱民活动开展得轰轰烈烈。广大革命群众认真学习人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风的革命精神，主动、热情地帮助人民解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作。前线陆、海、空三军指战员，一次次地深入群众，召开军民谈心会，广泛征求革命群众的意见，决心把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好，更加警惕地守卫好祖国的千里海防。党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，前线三军派出了数以千计的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、农村、机关、学校，同广大群众一起学习公报，落实公报提出的战斗任务。前线军民共同表示，一定要深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，提高自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，认真实现斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；一定要加强战备，随时准备消灭一切胆敢来犯的敌人，随时准备解放台湾，为人民立新功。
