How can one deeply and thoroughly study the history of the struggle between the two lines? The cadets of the Stenyang Military Region's Mao Zedong Thought Study Class have the following insights: In studying, one must use the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee as a guide, carry forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, closely link one's thoughts with reality, and draw lessons from reviewing the history of the struggle between the two lines to raise the consciousness of implementing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Executing which line is the issue of using which worldview to change the world

	At the beginning of the study, some comrades thought that studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, without linking it to personal thoughts, could still raise the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. Later, through recalling the history of the struggle between the two lines in various major historical periods, praising Chairman Mao's great teachings and great revolutionary practices, and criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes of fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in various historical periods and on various major issues, they deeply realized that the struggle between the two lines reflects the struggle between two worldviews in our minds. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the line of using the proletarian worldview to change the world; while Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is a reactionary line of stubbornly using the bourgeois worldview to change the world and attempting to obstruct the forward march of history. Different lines are the concentrated expressions of different worldviews.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat wants to change the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to change the world according to its worldview." As a proletarian revolutionary fighter, if one does not fundamentally change one's worldview, one cannot deeply understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and will find it difficult to consciously implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many comrades reviewed their mental states in various periods after entering the city in 1949 and deeply felt that when they continuously strove to change their worldview and guide their actions with proletarian thoughts, they could follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and seriously implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; otherwise, they could not consciously implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao said: "Within the Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army, there exist various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly corrected, the great revolutionary struggle of China entrusted to the Fourth Red Army will inevitably not be shouldered." Chairman Mao's great teachings have pointed out the fundamental way for us to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, making us clear that studying the history of the struggle between the two lines is not merely for the sake of studying, but to further arm our minds with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, eliminate its poison, and at the same time, draw lessons from the history of the struggle between the two lines, summarize the experiences and lessons of one's ideological transformation over the years, correct various non-proletarian thoughts that hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously transform one's subjective world, and raise the consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	In the education of both positive and negative aspects, the soul is deeply touched

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A revolutionary party and revolutionary people must repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to be tempered and mature, and to have the guarantee of victory." Everyone feels that studying the history of the struggle between the two lines is to undergo education from both positive and negative aspects in great praise and great criticism. Therefore, in their studies, they used the seven major historical periods pointed out by the editorial of the two newspapers and one magazine of the Central Committee, "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines," as the main thread, focusing on major issues such as what is the main contradiction within the country, what kind of country we want to build, and what path to take. They tightly grasped the red line from Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in 1949 to the "Bombard the Headquarters" in 1966, running through the period of socialist revolution, and extensively discussed the history of the struggle between the two lines. For each key issue of a historical period, they would study a brilliant work of Chairman Mao, conduct three "thinkings": think about what Chairman Mao taught at that time, how Deputy Chairman Lin followed, and think about the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, deepening the boundless love for Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line, further establishing red-hearted loyalty to Chairman Mao; think about how Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line at that time, recall the bitterness of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, further igniting deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line; think about how the working class and poor peasants firmly implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, recall one's own "thought alignment" at that time, and conduct self-education. In this way, everyone placed themselves in the education of both positive and negative aspects, touched their souls, drew lessons, and raised the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines.

	Some comrades, when reviewing the history of the struggle between the two lines during the period of socialist transformation, deeply felt that in Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he taught us to recognize that after the nationwide victory, the nature of the revolution must change, from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution; the form of struggle must change, from mainly "military struggle" to mainly "ideological struggle"; the focus of work must change, from surrounding the cities from the countryside to leading the countryside from the cities. At the same time, he warned us: the style of being humble, prudent, not arrogant, and not impatient must not change; the style of hard struggle must not change. However, what Chairman Mao taught us to "change," some comrades did not quickly follow; what Chairman Mao taught us not to "change," some people gradually changed. In this way, thoughts lagging behind the situation, one cannot well implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the future, one must remember this historical lesson. This correct attitude of drawing lessons from historical experiences has greatly inspired everyone. Many comrades consciously used Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as a guide, summarized their experiences and lessons of transforming their worldview in the struggle between the two lines, and further clarified the direction of future efforts.

	Using historical experiences to guide current struggles

	Many comrades, through studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, realized that deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines is to further arm their minds with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, raise the consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, use historical experiences to better guide our current struggle practice, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "not cutting off history," compared the current situation with the situations of several major historical periods since the founding of the country, drew out experiences and lessons from the comparisons as guides for future actions.

	For example, they compared the current situation with the situation before and after 1949, first seeing several similarities: both are on the eve of winning the final victory of the revolution; both face more arduous and greater historical tasks; both face sharp and complex class struggles and struggles between the two lines. Through such comparison and analysis, everyone deeply felt that at the turning point of the revolution, one must remember Chairman Mao's teachings on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, be alert to thoughts lagging behind the situation; in the face of victory, one must remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "always maintaining the style of being humble, prudent, not arrogant, and not impatient, and always maintaining the style of hard struggle," be alert to the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, prevent arrogance from past merits, and stagnation; in the face of new struggle tasks, one must remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "we can learn what we originally do not understand. We not only are good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world," be alert to the emergence of a sense of difficulty and a careless attitude; in the face of the new situation of class struggle, one must remember Chairman Mao's teachings on consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, be alert to enemies without guns, especially be alert to the bourgeois agents who have infiltrated the party and state leadership organs.

	At the same time, they also saw from the comparison that the current revolutionary struggle situation has different requirements for the ideological transformation of each individual compared to the past. These differences mainly manifest in: the revolution has gone deeper than before, the enemies of the revolution have become more hidden than before, the burden of the work teams of the People's Liberation Army has become heavier than before, and the responsibilities given by the party and the people have become greater than before. Everyone believes that these differences indicate that we must have a higher consciousness of the struggle between the two lines and the consciousness of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Many comrades deeply felt: under the dictatorship of the proletariat, not understanding the struggle between the two lines is not understanding class struggle. Without the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, one will not be able to distinguish friends from enemies with one's eyes, will not be able to distinguish right from wrong with one's ears, will not be able to smell the fragrance and stench with one's nose, and will not be able to walk on the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao with one's legs. Therefore, separating the struggle between the two lines to carry out "ideological transformation" is to carry out the "cultivation" approach. The consciousness of the struggle between the two lines is the foremost position of ideological transformation, is the foremost position of being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Among all loyalties, the loyalty forged by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most fundamental and thorough loyalty. Many comrades, when summarizing their experiences and lessons of ideological transformation in the struggle between the two lines, all felt that there are thousands of lessons to be learned, but the most fundamental one is to take Deputy Chairman Lin as a shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, consciously implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, frequently and repeatedly use Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to measure and guide one's words and deeds, firmly establish the viewpoint of class struggle, raise the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely advance, and carry the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end.

    学习两条路线斗争史要把自己摆进去
    ——沈阳部队干部毛泽东思想学习班学习两条路线斗争史的体会
    两条路线斗争的历史怎样才能学深、学好？人民解放军沈阳部队干部毛泽东思想学习班学员们的体会是：在学习中，要以伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和在七届二中全会上的报告为指针，发扬毛主席倡导的革命好学风，密切联系自己的思想实际，从重温两条路线斗争史中吸取教益，提高执行和捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。
      执行什么路线，就是用什么
  世界观改造世界的问题
    学习开始的时候，有的同志认为：学习两条路线斗争的历史，不联系个人思想，一样能提高路线斗争觉悟。后来，他们通过回忆各个重大历史时期两条路线斗争的历史，颂扬毛主席的伟大教导和伟大革命实践，批判大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在各个历史时期和各个重大问题上，向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进行拚死斗争的反革命罪行，从而深刻地认识到，两条路线的斗争，反映在我们头脑里就是两种世界观的斗争。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是用无产阶级世界观改造世界的路线；而刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，就是一条顽固地以资产阶级世界观改造世界、妄图阻挡历史车轮前进的反动路线。不同的路线，就是不同的世界观的集中体现。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”作为一个无产阶级革命战士，如果不使自己的世界观来一个根本的转变，就不可能深刻理解毛主席的革命路线，也很难自觉执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线。许多同志回顾了一九四九年进城以后各个时期的思想状况，深刻体会到：当自己不断努力改造世界观，用无产阶级思想统帅行动的时候，就能够紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；否则，就不能自觉地执行毛主席的革命路线。毛主席说：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”毛主席的伟大教导，给大家指明了学习两条路线斗争史的根本途径，使大家明确了学习两条路线斗争的历史，不是单纯地为了学习而去学习，而是要进一步用毛主席的革命路线武装我们的头脑，把刘少奇及其反革命修正主义路线彻底批臭、批透，清除它的毒素。同时，从两条路线的斗争史中吸取经验教训，总结自己这些年来思想改造中的经验教训，纠正妨碍贯彻毛主席革命路线的各种非无产阶级思想，不断改造自己的主观世界，提高执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。
  在正反两个方面的教育中深触灵魂
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。”大家体会，学习两条路线斗争史，就是要在大颂扬和大批判中经受正反两个方面的教育。因此，他们在学习中，以中央两报一刊社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》指出的建国以来七个重大历史时期为线索，围绕国内的主要矛盾是什么、我们要建设一个什么样的国家、要走什么道路等重大问题，紧紧抓住从一九四九年毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告到一九六六年《炮打司令部》贯串于社会主义革命时期的这一条红线，大摆两条路线斗争史。每摆一个历史时期的重点问题，都要学习一篇毛主席的光辉著作，进行三个“想一想”：想一想毛主席当时是怎样教导的，林副主席是怎样紧跟的，思毛主席革命路线的甜，加深对毛主席和毛主席革命路线的无比热爱，进一步树立对毛主席的赤胆忠心；想一想刘少奇当时是怎样疯狂反对毛主席革命路线的，忆受刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的苦，进一步激发对刘少奇和他的反革命修正主义路线的深仇大恨；想一想工人阶级、贫下中农是怎样坚决执行毛主席革命路线的，回忆自己当时“思想站队”的情况，进行自我教育。这样，大家就在大颂扬和大批判的正反两个方面的教育中，把自己“摆”进去，触及了灵魂，吸取了教益，提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    有些同志在重温社会主义改造这一历史时期的两条路线斗争史的时候，深有感触地说，毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告中，教导我们要认识到全国胜利以后革命性质要转变，由新民主主义革命转变为社会主义革命；斗争形式要转变，由“武战”为主转变为“文攻”为主；工作重点要转变，由农村包围城市转向城市领导农村。同时又告诫我们：谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风不能变；艰苦奋斗的作风不能变。可是，毛主席教导我们要“变”的，有的同志没有很快地跟着变，毛主席教导我们不要“变”的，有的人却逐渐变了。这样，思想跟不上形势，就不能很好地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，今后一定要记取这个历史教训。这种从历史经验中吸取教益的正确态度，对大家启发很大。许多同志都自觉地以毛主席的革命路线为指针，总结自己在两条路线斗争中改造世界观的经验教训，进一步明确了今后的努力方向。
    运用历史经验，指导当前斗争
    许多同志通过两条路线斗争史的学习，认识到，学好两条路线斗争史，就是要进一步用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装头脑，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，用历史的经验更好地指导我们当前的斗争实践，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们遵照毛主席关于“不要割断历史”的教导，把当前的形势和建国以来几个重大历史时期的形势，有重点地作了比较，从中引出经验教训，作为今后行动的向导。
    例如，他们把当前的形势和一九四九年前后的形势作了比较，首先看到有几个相似之处：都是处在夺取革命最后胜利的前夕；都面临着更艰苦、更伟大的历史任务；面临着尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。经过这样比较分析，大家深刻地体会到在革命的转折关头，要牢记毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的教导，警惕思想落后于形势；在胜利的面前，要牢记毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，警惕资产阶级的糖衣炮弹，防止居功骄傲，停滞不前；在新的斗争任务面前，要牢记毛主席关于“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的教导，警惕产生畏难情绪和“掉以轻心”的态度；在阶级斗争新形势面前，要牢记毛主席关于巩固和强化无产阶级专政的教导，警惕不拿枪的敌人，特别要警惕混进党和国家领导机构中的资产阶级代理人。
    同时，他们还从比较中看到当前的形势和那时形势的不同。看到当前的革命斗争形势，对每个人的思想革命化提出了比过去更高的要求。这些不同之处，主要表现在：革命比过去更加深入了，革命的敌人比过去更加隐蔽了，人民解放军工作队的担子比过去更加重了，党和人民交给自己的责任比过去更大了。大家认为，这些不同之处说明，我们必须具有更高的两条路线斗争觉悟，无产阶级专政下继续革命的觉悟。许多同志深刻体会到：在无产阶级专政下，不懂得路线斗争，就不懂得阶级斗争。没有两条路线斗争觉悟，就有眼分不清敌我，有耳辨不明是非，有鼻闻不出香臭，有腿走不上毛主席指引的光明大道。因此，离开两条路线斗争来搞“思想革命化”，就是搞“修养”那一套。两条路线斗争觉悟是思想革命化的首位，是永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的“忠”字化的首位。千忠万忠，用毛主席无产阶级革命路线锤炼出来的“忠”，才是最根本、最彻底的“忠”。许多同志总结个人在两条路线斗争中进行思想改造的经验教训时，都体会到，要吸取的教益有千条万条，最根本的一条，就是要以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，自觉地执行毛主席的革命路线，经常地、反复地用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，衡量和指导自己的言行，把阶级斗争观点树得牢牢的，把两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，把无产阶级专政下的革命进行到底。　　　　　沈班新
