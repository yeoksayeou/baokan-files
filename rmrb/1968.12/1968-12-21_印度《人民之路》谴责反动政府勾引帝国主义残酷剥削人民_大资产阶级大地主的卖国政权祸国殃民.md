New Delhi, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- The December issue of the Indian monthly "People's Path" published a commentary exposing and denouncing the Indian reactionary ruling clique for opening the door wide to imperialist forces, brutally exploiting the Indian people.

The commentary says, the profits foreign capital gains from investing in India are higher than those from investing in other parts of the world. In 1964, the average profit rate of U.S. capital invested in other countries was about 18 percent, while the profit rate of U.S. capital invested in India reached 14.9 percent. This is why the bloodsuckers of the U.S. and other countries are so eager to invest in India.

The commentary exposes that the Indian reactionary government is increasingly relying on the U.S. and other imperialist countries. The commentary says, the loans the Indian government borrows from abroad to cover budget deficits accounted for 9.2 percent of the total deficit during India's "First Five-Year Plan" (April 1951 - March 1956); increased to 29 percent during the "Second Five-Year Plan" (April 1956 - March 1961); and reached 49.2 percent during the "Third Five-Year Plan" (April 1961 - March 1966).

The commentary also denounces the Indian reactionary government for continuing to relax restrictions on foreign investors and establishing the "Foreign Investment Committee" to attract more foreign capital, allowing foreign monopoly capital to more extensively and deeply plunder the Indian people.

The commentary concludes: "The current Indian rulers are increasingly submitting to the foreign imperialists, thus increasing the suffering of the Indian people and damaging the national dignity of the Indian people every day. The rule of the comprador bourgeoisie and feudal lords, which is subservient to international imperialism, is a continuing calamity for the Indian people. The Indian people will undoubtedly get rid of this unholy alliance of domestic and foreign exploiters. Only through mass revolutionary actions under sound revolutionary leadership can the exploitation of these devils be ended."

    印度《人民之路》谴责反动政府勾引帝国主义残酷剥削人民
    大资产阶级大地主的卖国政权祸国殃民
    据新华社十九日讯　新德里消息：印度《人民之路》月刊十二月号发表社论，揭露并谴责印度反动统治集团敞开大门，引进帝国主义势力，残酷剥削印度人民。
    社论说，外国资本投入印度所得的利润比投入世界上其它地方所得的利润都要多些。在一九六四年，美国资本投入其它国家的平均利润率大约是百分之十点八，而投入印度的美国资本的利润率高达百分之十四点九。这就是为什么美国和其它国家的吸血鬼这样急切地要向印度投资的原因。
    社论揭露印度反动政府越来越依赖美国和其它帝国主义国家。社论说，印度政府为了弥补预算赤字而向外国借来的贷款，在印度的“第一个五年计划”期间（一九五一年四月——一九五六年三月）占赤字总数百分之九点二；在“第二个五年计划”期间（一九五六年四月——一九六一年三月）增加到百分之二十九；而在“第三个五年计划”期间（一九六一年四月——一九六六年三月）高达百分之四十九点二。
    社论还谴责印度反动政府继续放宽对外国投资者的限制，并且建立“外国投资委员会”，吸收更多外国资本，使外国垄断资本更广泛、深入地掠夺印度人民。
    社论最后指出：“目前的印度统治者越来越屈服在外国帝国主义者的脚下，因此每天在增加印度人民的苦难和损害印度人民的民族尊严。听命于国际帝国主义的卖国的资产阶级和封建主的统治是继续缠着印度人民的祸患。印度人民无疑地将摆脱这个国内外剥削者结成的不神圣同盟。只有通过在健全的革命领导下的群众革命行动，才能结束这些魔鬼的剥削。”（附图片）
