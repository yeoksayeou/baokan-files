Communist Party member Yang Zhirong has the sun in his heart. This is a line from the revolutionary modern Beijing opera *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*, where the Communist Party member Yang Zhirong is fighting in the heart of the enemy, in a very dangerous situation. This line reveals the noble qualities of Yang Zhirong's unlimited loyalty to the Party, to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought. It is also a vivid portrayal of Yang Zhirong's motto, "Everything for Chairman Mao."

Yang Zhirong has the sun in his heart. When accepting his mission, he knew the journey would be fraught with danger, but he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Choose the heaviest burden, and bear the hardships first." He bravely went forward, "alone into the tiger's den." Facing the arrogant bandits led by Seat Mountain Tiger, he firmly believed in the unshakable truth that "all reactionaries are paper tigers." Strategically, he despised the enemy, but tactically, he took them seriously. At every critical moment in the struggle, he displayed great heroism, overpowering the bandits led by Seat Mountain Tiger, leading them by the nose, and always maintaining the initiative in the fight against the enemy. In extremely dangerous situations, to seize the opportunity and not cause any loss to the Party's cause, he turned the tables and sent out the intelligence. When the bandit Tian Ping suddenly appeared, in a critical moment, Yang Zhirong acted bravely and calmly, seizing the enemy's weaknesses and contradictions, launching a surprise attack, and turning the danger into victory. Yang Zhirong's great wisdom and courage come from his loyalty to the Party and the people, from having the sun in his heart. This sun is the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Yang Zhirong has the sun in his heart, and this is based on a solid class foundation. "He was born into a family of hired laborers and has suffered greatly since childhood." "His father was driven to hang himself by the landlord, and his mother went mad with grief and died in the wilderness." These class hatreds and national grievances filled Yang Zhirong with intense hatred for the old society and boundless love for the Party and the people. He had a deep proletarian affection for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is why he could "fight in a hundred battles, risking his life to achieve great deeds."

Yang Zhirong has the sun in his heart, not just because of his miserable past, but more importantly because after joining the revolution, he consciously accepted the education of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary masses. Before setting out for Tiger Mountain, Xiao Jianbo, representing the Party organization, encouraged him to be "bold and cautious," and specially convened a support committee meeting to discuss the plan to defeat the enemy. Therefore, at critical moments in the struggle, Yang Zhirong always remembered, "The Party has great hopes for me, and the support committee members spoke to me with deep concern." He always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and acted according to Mao Zedong Thought. In the scene "Asking About Hardships in the Mountains," the hunter's family denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the bandit leader Seat Mountain Tiger, their "every word dripping with blood, every sound filled with tears." This further ignited Yang Zhirong's indignation and strengthened his resolve to "avenge the wrongs and settle the blood debt." Yang Zhirong was so determined to carry out his mission and so outstanding in completing it because, as he said, "The Party's words are a guarantee of victory, and Mao Zedong Thought shines forever."

Having the sun in one's heart is the source of wisdom and strength, the magic weapon for victory. Having the sun in one's heart means being invincible in battle.

    共产党员胸有朝阳——赞杨子荣
    南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、副连长  李万成
    “抗严寒化冰雪我胸有朝阳”。这是革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》中的共产党员杨子荣战斗在敌人心脏、处境十分险恶时的一句唱词。这句话是杨子荣无限忠于党，无限忠于人民，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想的高贵品质的深刻揭示，也是杨子荣“一切想着毛主席，一切为着毛主席”的生动写照。
    共产党员杨子荣“胸有朝阳”，在接受任务时，“明知征途有艰险”，但他牢记毛主席担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头的教导，“越是艰险越向前”，“只身把龙潭虎穴闯”。面对着座山雕顽匪们的嚣张气焰，他坚信“一切反动派都是纸老虎”这个颠扑不破的伟大真理，在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。在斗争的每个关键时刻，他都以大无畏的英雄气概，压倒了座山雕这伙顽匪，昂首阔步地牵着他们的鼻子走，自始至终掌握了对敌斗争的主动权。在情势非常危急的情况下，为了不误战机，不给党的事业造成损失，他将计就计，送出了情报。在匪徒栾平突然上山的千钧一发之际，他机智勇敢，临危不惧，镇静自若，抓住敌人的矛盾和弱点，主动进攻，致敌于死地，化险为夷，取得了斗争的胜利。杨子荣的大智大勇来自对党、对人民的赤胆忠心，来自“胸有朝阳”。这朝阳就是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    杨子荣“胸有朝阳”，是有着坚实的阶级基础的。“他出身雇农本质好，从小在生死线上受煎熬”。“老父亲被地主逼得悬梁上吊，老母亲气成疯癫死在荒郊”。这些阶级仇，民族恨，激起了杨子荣对旧社会的无比憎恨，对党对人民的无限热爱和对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线的无比深厚的无产阶级感情，所以他才能“身经百战、出生入死屡建勋劳”。
    杨子荣“胸有朝阳”，不单单是他的苦难身世所决定的，而更重要的是他参加革命以后，自觉地接受毛泽东思想和革命群众教育的结果。在他出发去威虎山之前，少剑波代表党组织鼓励他“大胆、谨慎”，并专门召开了支委会讨论了战胜敌人的作战计划。因此，在斗争的紧要关头，杨子荣总是时刻不忘“党对我寄托着无限希望，支委会上同志们语重心长”。总是时刻不忘毛主席的教导，处处按毛泽东思想办事。在“深山问苦”一场，常猎户一家控诉国民党反动派和匪首座山雕压迫人民的罪恶，“字字血，声声泪”的苦难家史，更加激起了杨子荣的满腔怒火，坚定了他的“要报仇，要伸冤，血债要用血来偿”的决心。杨子荣所以执行任务这样坚决，完成任务这样出色，拿他的话来说，就是“党的话句句是胜利保障，毛泽东思想永放光芒”。
   “胸有朝阳”是智慧和力量的源泉，是克敌制胜的法宝；“胸有朝阳”就攻无不克，战无不胜。
