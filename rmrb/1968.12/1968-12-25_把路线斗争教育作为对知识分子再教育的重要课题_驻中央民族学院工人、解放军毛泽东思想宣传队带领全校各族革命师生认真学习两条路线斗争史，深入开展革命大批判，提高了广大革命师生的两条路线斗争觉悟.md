The workers and People's Liberation Army propaganda teams stationed at the Central Institute for Nationalities, following the instructions of Chairman Mao, led all the revolutionary teachers and students of various nationalities on campus to deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines. They regarded the education on the struggle between the two lines as an important topic for the re-education of intellectuals, significantly raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary teachers and students, and powerfully promoting the school's struggle, criticism, and reform.

After entering the school, the propaganda teams discovered that some students who came from families with deep grievances, initially entered the school barefoot, but after a few years, they became obsessed with eating, dressing, and living luxuriously. Some even dreamed of becoming "district heads" or "county heads" after graduation, boasting as the "first generation of college graduates from their nationality." The old workers in the propaganda teams saw this situation and felt deeply pained. They realized that the root cause of these phenomena was the result of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's frenzied promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Only by guiding the broad revolutionary teachers and students to deeply study the history of the struggle between the two lines, to recognize the reactionary essence of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and its harm to them, could they consciously accept the re-education of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and advance under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The propaganda teams organized revolutionary teachers and students to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the institute, using Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee as a textbook. They mobilized the broad teachers and students to thoroughly expose the facts of the struggle between the two lines over the past eighteen years since the institute's establishment; to praise Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; and to criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The revolutionary teachers and students reviewed the history of this school. They said that Chairman Mao had long ago clearly pointed out that the fundamental task of nationalities education is to cultivate a large number of communist cadres of minority nationalities. However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, excluded the leadership of the working class, and advocated "expert-led" management, allowing a small handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist roaders to control the power of school education. These demons and monsters vigorously promoted the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, obstructing revolutionary teachers and students from studying Chairman Mao's works, ordering the dissolution of study groups for Chairman Mao's works, and forcing students to study "metaphysics" and things like "the soul of a fly," which are decadent and corrupt bourgeois cultural arts, attempting to prepare "talents" for their restoration of capitalism.

Deep historical lessons made the broad revolutionary teachers and students realize that the eighteen-year history of the school is the history of the struggle between the two lines. The focus of the struggle has always been around the issue of "power." On this basis, the propaganda teams led the teachers and students to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, holding large and small criticism meetings, fiercely criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the extinction of class struggle," and raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad teachers and students.

Most of the students in this institute are children of serfs, slaves, and poor farmers and herdsmen from the border regions of various nationalities, each with a history of hardship; some were even slaves themselves. Given this situation, the propaganda teams first invited old workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who had suffered the most to recount their hardships. While recalling the sufferings under imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule, they fiercely criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the party and the country, acting as a running dog for imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries. Then, they let the students who had deep grievances recount their hardships. Through sharing hardships and stirring up hatred, the students' grievances poured out like water from an opened sluice gate. The broad emancipated serfs and slaves from the Tibetan Plateau and the Greater and Lesser Liangshan Mountains of Sichuan said, before the democratic reforms, we lived like animals. Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, promoted a line of class capitulation. He was the chief culprit who colluded with the three great lords, tribal chiefs, and headmen to brutally suppress the broad serfs and laboring people of all nationalities. Every hardship we suffered before the democratic reforms has Liu Shaoqi, this big traitor, to account for! This account must be settled today! Through recalling class hardships and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, revolutionary teachers and students deeply realized the class roots of the struggle between the two lines, raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

    把路线斗争教育作为对知识分子再教育的重要课题
    驻中央民族学院工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队带领全校各族革命师生认真学习两条路线斗争史，深入开展革命大批判，提高了广大革命师生的两条路线斗争觉悟
    本报讯　驻中央民族学院工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席的教导，带领全校各族革命师生深入学习两条路线斗争的历史，把两条路线斗争教育当作对知识分子再教育的重要课题，大大提高了广大革命师生的两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了学校的斗、批、改。
    宣传队进校后，发现一些苦大仇深的奴隶子女，刚进校时光着两只脚，几年工夫就变得讲吃讲穿讲阔气。有的想毕业后以“本民族第一代大学生”的姿态回去当“区长”、当“县长”。宣传队的老工人看到这种情况，感到很痛心，深刻地认识到，产生上述现象的根源，是由于大叛徒刘少奇疯狂推行反革命修正主义教育路线的结果。只有引导广大革命师生深入学习两条路线斗争的历史，认清大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的反动本质及其对自己的毒害，才能使他们自觉地接受工农兵的再教育，在毛主席革命路线指引下不断前进。
    宣传队组织革命师生在全院大办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为教材，发动广大师生大摆建院十八年来两条路线斗争的事实；大颂毛主席的革命路线；大批大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。革命师生回顾了这个学校的历史，他们说，毛主席早就明确指出民族教育工作的根本任务是培养大批少数民族出身的共产主义干部。而大叛徒刘少奇却疯狂抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，排斥工人阶级领导，大搞“专家治校”，学校教育大权让一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派所把持。这些牛鬼蛇神大肆推行大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，阻挠革命师生学习毛主席著作，勒令师生解散学习毛主席著作小组，强迫学生去研究“玄学”，研究什么“苍蝇的灵魂”等资产阶级腐朽糜烂的文化艺术，企图为他们复辟资本主义准备“人才”。
    深刻的历史教训，使广大革命师生认识到：学校十八年的历史，就是两条路线斗争的历史。斗争的焦点，始终是围绕着一个“权”字。在此基础上，宣传队带领师生深入开展革命大批判，连续召开大小批判会，狠批大叛徒刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，提高了广大师生的两条路线斗争觉悟。
    这个学院的绝大多数学生都是边疆各少数民族地区苦大仇深的农奴、奴隶、贫苦农牧民的子女，他们每人都有一部苦难的家史；有的本人就当过“娃子”（奴隶）。根据这个情况，宣传队首先请那些受苦最深的老工人、贫下中农和解放军战士忆苦，在忆帝国主义和国民党反动统治的苦时，狠批大叛徒刘少奇叛党叛国，充当帝国主义、国民党反动派走狗的滔天罪行。然后，让那些苦大仇深的同学忆苦，通过以苦引苦，以仇激仇，同学们的苦水就象开了闸门的河水一样倾泻出来。来自西藏高原、四川大小凉山的广大翻身农奴、奴隶的子女说，在民主改革以前，我们过的是牛马不如的生活。刘少奇这个大坏蛋，却推行一条阶级投降路线，他就是勾结三大领主、土司、头人残酷镇压广大农奴和各族劳动人民的罪魁祸首。我们在民主改革前所受的每一个苦难，都有刘少奇这个大内奸一份账，这笔账今天一定要算清！通过忆阶级苦和批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线相结合，使革命师生深刻地认识到路线斗争的阶级根源，提高了他们的路线斗争觉悟。
