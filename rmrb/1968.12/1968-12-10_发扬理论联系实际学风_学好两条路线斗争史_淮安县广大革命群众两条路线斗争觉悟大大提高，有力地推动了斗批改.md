The revolutionary masses in Huai'an County have greatly enhanced their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, which has effectively promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 8th: Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Committee of Huai'an County in Jiangsu Province has led the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses of the entire county to promote the revolutionary learning style of linking theory with practice. They have closely combined the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines with the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They have insisted on learning in the midst of struggle and learning in the midst of reform, thereby rapidly pushing the ongoing struggle, criticism, and transformation to a deeper level.

After the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines began, some units felt overwhelmed by the many tasks at hand. They reflected, "We need to implement the communiqué, grasp the struggle, criticism, and transformation firmly, and the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines is also very important. We don't know how to handle it well." How to solve this problem? The leading comrades of the county Revolutionary Committee and the supporting army units went deep into the communes, production teams, and factories to find solutions. The Pingqiao Commune originally had difficulty pushing forward the work of cleaning up the class ranks, and the idea of "good enough" emerged. For this reason, the commune Revolutionary Committee held Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the commune, brigade, and production team levels, focusing on studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. They organized revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to study Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, to study Mao Zedong's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to emphasize Mao Zedong's views on class struggle. They severely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's theory of "extinguishing class struggle," thoroughly eliminating the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Through study and criticism, everyone deeply realized that the idea of "good enough" is a manifestation of low awareness of the struggle between the two lines. After raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, the entire commune launched a new battle to thoroughly expose class enemies, uncovering a cunning class enemy who had covered up class struggle and disguised himself well, further promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire commune. Many good experiences similar to those of the Pingqiao Commune made the leading comrades of the county Revolutionary Committee and the supporting army units deeply realize that the ongoing struggle, criticism, and transformation is a continuation of the struggle between the two lines. The struggle between the two lines runs through the entire process of struggle, criticism, and transformation. It is necessary to deeply carry out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines in conjunction with actual conditions, further raising the broad masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. By doing so, the broad masses can more consciously, seriously, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. They can fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation well. Under this guiding thought, the county Revolutionary Committee made arrangements to grasp the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the communiqué, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. It quickly launched a wave of in-depth study of the history of the struggle between the two lines in all people's communes and factories, schools, and organs throughout the county, further promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire county. Those who originally felt that the work was overwhelming reflected, "By linking the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines with the actual conditions of our unit, we have integrated the current study, struggle, criticism, and reform."

Chairman Mao recently pointed out, "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; the broad revolutionary masses should know about it." In leading the masses to carry out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the Revolutionary Committee of Huai'an County repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further understanding that when the masses grasp the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines, they can better understand that the struggle, criticism, and transformation is a continuation of the struggle between the two lines, and they can continuously raise their awareness of seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

In the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, many units repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, linking the past and present of their units. They thought about how Chairman Mao instructed them and how Liu Shaoqi poisoned them, connecting the historical struggle between the two lines with the current struggle, thus deeply understanding that the struggle, criticism, and transformation is a continuation of the struggle between the two lines. They were determined to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly.

Chairman Mao taught, "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." In carrying out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the Revolutionary Committee of Huai'an County deeply felt that by seriously studying the history of the struggle between the two lines and using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a mirror, they could examine and check the struggle, criticism, and transformation of every sector. They could have a far-reaching vision, a clear direction, and a firm resolve, and with a thorough revolutionary spirit, they could carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well.

The Revolutionary Committee had the deepest experience in simplifying and strengthening the construction of the political power. In the early days of the Revolutionary Committee's establishment, due to the inability to break away from the old circle, the simplification of the organization was done poorly, and workers and poor and lower-middle peasants criticized it. Regarding this problem, the county Revolutionary Committee held a special study class, mobilizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on the construction of political power, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line in the construction of political power, and emphasizing the history of the struggle between the two lines in the construction of political power. They severely criticized and transformed old ideas, old styles, and old systems, completely abolishing the old ministries and bureaus of more than forty units, and the Revolutionary Committee set up only four groups. The number of staff was only ten percent of the original party and government organs. More importantly, they highlighted proletarian politics, promoted revolution, production, and work, and all aspects presented a vigorous and new scene.

    发扬理论联系实际学风　学好两条路线斗争史
    淮安县广大革命群众两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，有力地推动了斗批改
    据新华社南京八日电　江苏省淮安县革委会在支左解放军的帮助下，领导全县工人、贫下中农和广大革命人民发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，把两条路线斗争史的学习运动同斗、批、改紧密地结合起来，坚持在斗争中学，在改革中学，使正在进行的斗、批、改迅速向纵深发展。
    两条路线斗争史的学习运动展开后，有的单位感到头绪多。他们反映说：“公报要落实，斗、批、改要狠抓，两条路线斗争史的学习又非常重要，不知怎么抓好。”怎样解决这一问题呢？县革委会和支左部队的领导同志，分别深入公社、生产队和工厂去找办法。平桥公社原来清理阶级队伍的工作深入不下去，出现了“差不多”的思想。为此，公社革委会在公社、大队、生产队分别举办了以学习两条路线斗争史为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命干部和贫下中农大学毛主席的革命路线，大学毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，大讲特讲毛主席关于阶级斗争的观点，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒。通过学习和大批判，使大家深刻认识到，“差不多”的思想，是两条路线斗争觉悟不高的表现。两条路线斗争觉悟提高后，全公社展开了一场深挖阶级敌人的新战斗，揪出了一个捂住阶级斗争盖子、伪装得十分巧妙的走资派，进一步推动了全公社的斗、批、改。类似平桥公社的许多好经验，使县革委会和支左部队的领导同志深刻认识到，当前正在进行的斗、批、改，是两条路线斗争的继续，两条路线斗争贯串在斗、批、改的始终。必须联系实际深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步提高广大群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。这样做，就能使广大群众更自觉、更认真、更坚决地落实毛主席的最新指示和党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，就能打好斗、批、改这一仗。在这一思想指导下，县革委会作出了狠抓两条路线斗争史的学习，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示和公报，认真搞好斗、批、改的部署，很快在全县各人民公社和工厂、学校、机关掀起了深入学习两条路线斗争史的热潮，进一步推动了全县的斗、批、改。原来感到工作千头万绪的同志反映说：“联系本单位的实际，抓了两条路线斗争史的学习，就把当前的学习、斗争、批判和改革全部贯串起来了。”
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”淮安县革委会在领导群众开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，反复学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，进一步体会到，让群众掌握了两条路线斗争的历史经验，他们就能更好地理解斗、批、改是两条路线斗争的继续，就能不断提高认真搞好斗、批、改的自觉性。
    在两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，许多单位都带着本单位斗、批、改中的问题，反复学习毛主席的最新指示，学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告。他们联系本单位的过去和现状，想想毛主席是怎样教导的，看看刘少奇是怎样放毒的，把历史上的两条路线斗争同当前斗争联系起来，就更深刻地理解了斗、批、改是两条路线斗争的继续，决心把斗、批、改搞彻底。
    毛主席教导说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”淮安县革委会在开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中深刻体会到，认真地学习两条路线斗争的历史，以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为镜子，对照检查各行各业每一项的斗、批、改，就能有远大的眼光，明确的方向，坚强的决心，以彻底革命的精神把斗、批、改搞好。
    县革委会在精兵简政加强政权建设方面体会最深。革委会成立初期，由于未能跳出旧圈子，精简机构搞得很差，工人和贫下中农提出了批评。针对这一问题，县革委会举办了专题学习班，放手发动群众大学毛主席关于政权建设的英明指示，狠批刘少奇在政权建设方面推行的修正主义路线，大讲特讲在政权建设上的两条路线斗争史，大批大改旧思想、旧作风、旧制度，把旧部委、旧科局四十多个单位全部撤消，革委会只设四个组，工作人员只等于原党政机关的百分之十。不仅如此，更重要的是突出了无产阶级政治，抓革命，促生产，促工作，各方面都呈现出一派生气蓬勃新景象。
