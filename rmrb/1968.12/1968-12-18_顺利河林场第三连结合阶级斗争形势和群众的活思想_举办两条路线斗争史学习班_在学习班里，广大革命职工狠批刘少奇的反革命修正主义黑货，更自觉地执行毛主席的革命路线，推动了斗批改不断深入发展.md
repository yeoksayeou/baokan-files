The Third Brigade of Shunlihe Forest Farm in Meixi District, Yichun City, Heilongjiang Province (formerly the Third Small Work Team) has closely combined the actual situation of the unit and held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the history of the struggle between the two lines as the main content. Since March last year, they have held thirty-four sessions. The class consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers in the struggle between the two lines has been continuously improved, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation have been deeply promoted.

The study class must closely combine with the new situation of class struggle

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." How to continuously improve the political awareness of the broad revolutionary workers in the struggle? The practice of the Third Brigade has proven that closely combining with the new situation of class struggle, holding a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the history of the struggle between the two lines as the main content is an effective method.

In May this year, when the Third Brigade was about to deepen the struggle against the enemy, someone said: "Our brigade is an advanced unit. For more than forty people, we have been together for many years. Who doesn't know who? The class enemies who should be criticized have been criticized, and those who should be managed have been managed. It's been done 'more or less,' so what other enemies are there to dig out?" The leading cadre of the Third Brigade analyzed this and believed that this sentiment reflected that some comrades had low class consciousness in the struggle between the two lines, weak class struggle awareness, and lacked the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. Therefore, they held a study class with this problem. In the study class, everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, studied the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party, combined with the class struggle situation of the unit, and severely criticized the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." This greatly improved the workers' class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. The revolutionary criticism and the mass movement to thoroughly expose class enemies quickly swept through the entire brigade. The broad revolutionary workers used the perspective of class struggle to analyze everything and quickly exposed a class enemy who had been hiding in the workers' ranks for many years.

The study class must focus on the "old and difficult" problems

"Adopt and cultivate dual contract" is the forest version of the big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "three self and one contract." The revolutionary workers of the Third Brigade held high the banner of revolutionary criticism and severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's fallacy. However, due to its widespread poison and deep harm, it often manifested in other forms.

In November last year, the brigade again used the piecework wage method to contract the public firewood to workers for logging. After the incident, the masses said: "We have been poisoned by 'adopt and cultivate dual contract' again." The leading cadre of the Third Brigade, with this problem, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The remnants of old ideas that reflect the old system are always lingering in people's minds and do not want to leave easily." Everyone realized that "adopt and cultivate dual contract" in the forest area had deep poison, becoming a long-standing "old and difficult" problem that has been hindering the construction of forestry enterprises, a historical lesson of forestry enterprises. If it is not repeatedly criticized, the poisonous root cannot be eradicated. Therefore, they immediately held a study class on the history of the struggle between the two lines, organizing revolutionary workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's notes in the article "Serious Lessons," thoroughly exposing the harm of "three self and one contract" and "adopt and cultivate dual contract," and severely criticizing the poison spread by the big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi in 1961 when he sneaked into the Yichun Forest Area. The workers pointed out that the big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi advocated "adopt and cultivate dual contract," falsely claiming that "afforestation can adopt the contract form," "artificial renewal can adopt the method of the forest farm, work section, work group, and family members contracting to plant, nurture, and manage to forest," intending to divide the state's forests into pieces and contract them to small work teams and family members to manage, attempting to restore capitalism. They angrily said: "Adopt and cultivate dual contract, contract wood, contract forests, contract wages, this 'contract' is a 'pus bag,' a 'cancer,' contracting private ownership of capitalism, leading us to the 'black road' of restoring capitalism. This road we absolutely cannot take!" The workers' consciousness of the struggle between the two lines was improved, and the "old and difficult" problem was gradually solved.

The study class must address the active thoughts of the masses

This autumn, after the brigade moved to a new logging area, they built houses and prepared for operations, with a lot of work to do. The day shift production plan was not completed for a while. At this time, someone thought that the Third Brigade was an advanced collective that attended the provincial second session of the active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought, and it would be inexcusable if the production task was not completed. They should focus on production. Some leading members also actively advocated using "assault tactics" to boost production. Thus, production was placed first, learning was relaxed, the time for reading every day was squeezed out, and revolutionary criticism was relaxed.

In response to this phenomenon, they held another study class on the history of the struggle between the two lines, first repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on highlighting proletarian politics, and severely criticizing the big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy of "business first" and "production first." Many people pointed out that Chairman Mao had long taught us: "Politics is the commander, the soul." "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Chairman Mao's teachings have pointed out a clear direction for socialist enterprises. However, the big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, when he sneaked into the Yichun Forest Area in 1961, falsely claimed: "The standard of enterprise management is whether the logging, afforestation, material collection, and loading tasks are completed well, etc.," which was completely contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings. The broad revolutionary workers again exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who, according to Liu Shaoqi's tune, shouted: "Completing the task well is learning well, which is highlighting politics," and pointed out in a piercing way that this was an attempt to lead us workers to the counter-revolutionary revisionist evil road of "only grabbing big logs and not distinguishing between enemies and friends."

Through repeated study, comparison, and criticism, the broad revolutionary workers improved their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. After everyone's awareness was improved, the busier the work, the more they highlighted proletarian politics, insisted on reading every day and criticizing every day, and their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines became higher and higher, and the revolutionary and production situation became better and better.

    举办两条路线斗争史学习班
    在学习班里，广大革命职工狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货，更自觉地执行毛主席的革命路线，推动了斗批改不断深入发展
    本报讯　黑龙江省伊春市美溪区顺利河林场第三连（原第三小工队），紧密结合本单位的实际，开办以两条路线斗争史为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班，向广大革命职工进行两条路线斗争史的教育。从去年三月以来，已经连续举办了三十四期。广大革命职工的两条路线斗争的觉悟越来越高，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    学习班要紧密结合阶级斗争新形势
    毛主席最近指出：“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”怎样在斗争中不断提高广大革命职工的政治觉悟？三连的实践证明：紧密结合阶级斗争的新形势，大办以两条路线斗争史为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班，是一种有效的方法。
    今年五月，三连正要深入开展对敌斗争的时候，有人说：“我们连是先进单位，四十多个人多少年来都在一块，谁还不知道谁？对阶级敌人该批的批了，该管的管了，搞得‘差不多了’，那还有什么敌人可挖？”三连的领导班子经过分析之后认为，这种情绪反映了有些同志两条路线斗争觉悟不高，阶级斗争观念淡薄，缺乏无产阶级的彻底革命精神。于是，他们带着这个问题，办起了学习班。在学习班里，大家反复学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，学习党内两条路线的斗争史，结合本单位的阶级斗争情况，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，使工人的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。革命大批判和深挖阶级敌人的群众运动，很快就在全连掀起来了。广大革命工人用阶级斗争的观点分析一切，很快就揪出了一个在工人队伍中隐藏了多年的阶级敌人。
    学习班要抓住“老大难”问题
    “采育双包”是大工贼刘少奇“三自一包”在林区的翻版。三连革命职工高举革命大批判的旗帜，狠批了刘少奇的这一谬论。但是，由于它的流毒很广，危害极深，还经常通过其他形式表现出来。
    去年十一月份，这个连又用计件工资方法，把公用烧柴包给工人采伐。事情发生后，群众反映说：“我们又中了‘采育双包’的毒。”三连领导班子带着这个问题，学习了毛主席的教导：“反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。”大家认识到，“采育双包”在林区流毒很深，成为长期以来阻碍林业企业建设的一个“老大难”的问题，是林业企业中的历史教训，不反复进行批判，毒根就挖不掉。于是，他们立即开办了两条路线斗争史学习班，组织革命职工反复学习毛主席在《严重的教训》一文中的按语，大摆“三自一包”、“采育双包”的危害，狠批了大工贼刘少奇一九六一年窜到伊春林区所散布的毒素。工人们指出，大工贼刘少奇鼓吹“采育双包”，胡说什么“造林可以采用包工的形式”、“人工更新，可以采取由林场、工段、工组、家属，包栽、包活、包抚育、包成林的方法”，就是要把国家的林子分片包给小工队，包给家属经营，妄图复辟资本主义。他们气愤地说：“采育双包，包木头，包林子，包工资，这个‘包’是‘脓包’，是‘毒瘤’，包了资本主义私有制，是拉我们走复辟资本主义的‘黑路’。这条路我们绝对不能走！”工人们的两条路线斗争觉悟提高了，“老大难”问题也逐步得到了解决。
    学习班要针对群众中的活思想
    今年秋天，连队刚搬到一个新伐区，又盖房舍，又搞准备作业，工作很多，日班生产计划一度完不成。这时有人认为，三连是出席省第二次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的先进集体，完不成生产任务没法交代，要把精力放在生产上。有的领导成员也积极主张用“突击战术”，把生产搞上去。于是生产摆到了首位，放松了学习，天天读的时间挤掉了，革命大批判放松了。
    针对这种现象，他们又办了两条路线斗争史的学习班，首先反复学习毛主席关于突出无产阶级政治的教导，狠批了大工贼刘少奇“业务挂帅”、“生产第一”的反革命修正主义谬论。很多人指出，毛主席早就教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”毛主席的教导，给社会主义企业指出了明确的方向。而大工贼刘少奇在一九六一年窜到伊春林区时却胡说什么：“企业管理的标准是采伐、造林、集材、装车任务完成得好等等”，与毛主席的教导大唱反调。广大革命工人又揭发、批判了本单位党内一小撮走资派按照刘少奇的腔调，叫嚷什么“完成任务好，就是学习好，就是突出政治”的反革命修正主义黑货，一针见血地指出，这是妄图把我们工人引向“只抓大木头，不分敌我友”的反革命修正主义邪路上去。
    通过这样反复学、对照批，广大革命工人提高了两条路线斗争的自觉性。大家认识提高以后，工作越忙，越突出无产阶级政治，坚持天天读，天天批，两条路线斗争觉悟越来越高，革命、生产形势越来越好。
