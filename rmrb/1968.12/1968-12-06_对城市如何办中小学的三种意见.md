Recently, many schools in Shanghai, under the leadership of worker propaganda teams, have used "Mao Zedong on Educational Revolution" as a weapon to fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line. They have also actively explored the path for urban educational revolution. Now, Shanghai has launched a heated discussion on this issue in newspapers. In the discussion, people have different views on how to carry out the urban educational revolution thoroughly and how to run urban schools in the future. Summarized, there are roughly the following opinions:

1. Factories Run Primary Schools. Those who advocate for factories running primary schools suggest that schools should be managed by nearby factories (small factories can join forces to manage a school together). Schools should be equivalent to a primary unit (workshop) of the factory, directly under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee. They believe that the biggest advantage of factories running schools is breaking away from the past practice of urban schools being led by the municipal education bureau, district education bureau, and key schools, which is a revisionist single-line leadership. This way, the leadership of schools will be directly and permanently in the hands of the working class. Students can learn, work, and participate in the class struggle of the factory during the learning process. Teachers will also be part of the factory and will no longer receive salaries from the state. Except for a few full-time teachers, the rest of the teachers will teach while working and receive re-education from the working class, and be issued a "qualification certificate." Schools will mainly be taught by excellent workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and soldiers with practical experience as part-time teachers, changing the class composition of the teaching staff. After the school is run by the factory, it should also be linked with rural people's communes. Teachers and students should spend a considerable amount of time working in rural people's communes, learning basic agricultural production knowledge from poor and lower-middle peasants, and receiving class education. This will change the urban students' emphasis on industry over agriculture.

2. Neighborhoods Run Primary Schools. Those who hold this view suggest that in cities where worker propaganda teams have been stationed in neighborhoods, establish neighborhood revolutionary committees with industrial workers and retired workers as the main body, and hand over the schools to the neighborhoods to run. They should also absorb excellent neighborhood cadres and revolutionary parents to participate in school leadership, fully utilizing the role of retired old workers in neighborhoods. Schools should be managed by the neighborhoods. Under the unified leadership of the neighborhoods, students and teachers can participate in labor in neighborhood factories, markets, sanitation management stations, and other fronts, and participate in the class struggle of the region. Schools should also invite workers, peasants, and soldiers to teach in the school. Outside the school, neighborhood organizations should be established with neighborhoods as units, hiring retired workers and neighborhood cadres and revolutionary parents as outside instructors. They should be responsible for organizing students' activities outside the school, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and participating in the region's class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment three great revolutionary movements. Some suggest implementing a combination of neighborhoods, factories, and schools. In the past, due to the separation of families, neighborhoods, and schools, parents did not know the situation of their children in school, and teachers did not understand the performance of students at home. Some class enemies took advantage of this gap and used the neighborhood as a battlefield to instill bourgeois ideology in young people, competing with us for the next generation. Some young people were even lured and corrupted into becoming hooligans and delinquents. Primary schools implementing a combination of neighborhoods, factories, and schools have the main advantage of changing the past phenomenon of separation of school, society, and family education. Especially for primary school students, who spend more time in families and neighborhoods, it is necessary to implement a combination of society, family, and school education to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. This can better utilize the role of retired old workers, revolutionary workers' families, revolutionary neighborhood cadres, revolutionary parents, and teachers. It can also mobilize all neighborhood residents to discuss the education of their children in reading groups. Some suggest that in the future, cities should establish people's communes with neighborhoods as units, and schools should be led by urban people's communes.

3. Urban Schools Do Not Necessarily Need to Be Run by Factories or Neighborhoods. In the case of worker propaganda teams staying in schools for a long time, schools should maintain a linkage relationship with factories, communes, and neighborhoods, and teachers and students should participate in labor regularly. They believe that in this way, education can also be combined with class struggle, production practice, and workers, peasants, and soldiers, cultivating successors of the proletarian revolution.

There is a heated discussion on the above three opinions from all sides. Currently, all three schemes have some schools practicing them. For example, the Shanghai Constant Temperature Control Instrument Factory has taken over a school; in Huangpu District, Xuhui District, Hongkou District, and Nanshi District, neighborhood-run schools have already started or are starting trial points; Zhonghua Middle School and the Third Primary School on Xiangyang South Road have basically established the "May 7th" school according to the third scheme; Shanghai No. 6 Middle School and Kongjiang Middle School are actively preparing to establish work-study and farm-study branches in factories and rural areas; some middle schools even plan to move the school to rural areas to run it. Currently, the worker propaganda teams in various districts are, while focusing on the work of cleaning up the class ranks in schools, also organizing education revolution investigation teams. They have selected some units with good class rank cleaning, strong leadership teams, and successful big character posters to lead them in carrying out education revolution trial work.

### 对城市如何办中小学的三种意见

    对城市如何办中小学的三种意见
    最近以来，上海市许多学校的革命师生在工人宣传队领导下，以《毛主席论教育革命》为武器，狠批刘少奇的修正主义教育路线，并积极探索城市学校教育革命的途径，现在，上海已就这个问题在报纸上展开了热烈的讨论。在讨论中，大家对于怎样把城市教育革命进行到底，今后城市学校究竟怎样办，有各种不同的看法。归纳起来，大体有下面几种意见：
    一、工厂办小学。主张工厂办小学的同志建议，学校应由附近的工厂来办（小厂可以几家合起来共同管理一所学校）。学校相当于工厂的一个基层单位（车间），属厂革命委员会直接领导。他们认为工厂办学校的最大好处是破除了过去城市学校由市教育局——区教育局——重点学校这条修正主义单线领导，使学校的领导权，直接、永远掌握在工人阶级手里。学生在学习过程中，可以边学习、边劳动、边参加工厂的阶级斗争。教师也作为工厂的一员，不再由国家发给工资。除留少数专职教师以外，其余教师一边教学一边劳动，接受工人阶级的再教育，并发给“合格证”。学校主要由有实践经验的优秀工人、贫下中农、解放军战士担任兼职教师，改变教师队伍的阶级成份。学校由工厂办以后，也要同农村人民公社挂钩。师生要有较长时间到农村人民公社劳动，由贫下中农传授农业生产基本知识，进行阶级教育。改变城市学生重工轻农的思想。
    二、街道办小学。持这种意见的同志建议，在城市的街道，都进驻工人毛泽东思想宣传队的情况下，建立以产业工人、退休工人为主体的街道革命委员会，把学校交给街道来办，并吸收优秀的里弄干部、革命家长参加学校领导，充分发挥街道里弄的退休老工人的作用，把学校下放到街道去管理。在街道统一领导下，学生、教师可以到街道工厂、菜场、清洁管理站等各条战线参加劳动，参加本地区的阶级斗争。学校并从校外请工农兵讲师团来校上课。在校外，则以街道里弄为单位成立红小兵组织，聘请退休工人和里弄干部、革命家长当校外辅导员，负责组织学生的校外生活，举办毛泽东思想学习班，参加本地区的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。有的同志建议实行以街道为主，与厂、校三结合来办。过去，由于家庭、里弄、学校三者脱节，家长不知道孩子在学校的情况，老师不了解学生在家里的表现，有的阶级敌人就钻了空子，利用里弄这块阵地，对青少年灌输资产阶级思想，和我们争夺下一代。个别青少年甚至被拉拢、腐蚀堕落成为流氓阿飞分子。小学实行以街道为主，与厂、校三结合来办，最主要的优点是能够改变过去学校、社会、家庭教育三脱节的现象。特别对于小学生来说，在家里、里弄中活动时间比较长，必须实行社会、家庭、学校教育三结合，才能有利于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，更好地发挥退休老工人、革命职工家属、革命里弄干部、革命家长和教师的作用，还可以在读报组里发动所有里弄居民讨论对子女的教育问题。有些同志还设想将来以街道为单位成立城市人民公社，学校就由城市人民公社来领导。
    三、城市学校不一定由工厂、街道来办。在工人宣传队长期留在学校的情况下，学校同工厂、公社、街道保持一个挂钩的关系，师生定期参加劳动。他们认为，这样，同样可以使教育同阶级斗争、同生产实践、同工农兵结合起来，培养无产阶级革命接班人。
    对于以上三种意见，各方面正在热烈地讨论。目前，三种方案都分别有一些学校进行实践。如上海恒温控制器厂已经接办了一所学校；在黄浦区、徐汇区、虹口区以及南市区都已经或正在开始作街道办学的试点；中国中学和襄阳南路第三小学已基本上按照第三个方案创办了中国“五·七”学校；上海市第六中学、控江中学都积极准备在工厂、农村分别设立学工、学农分校；个别的中学还设想把学校搬到农村去办。现在，各区工人宣传队在狠抓学校的清理阶级队伍工作的同时，也都组织了教育革命调查组，选择了一些清理阶级队伍好、领导班子强、大批判有成绩的单位，领导他们开展教育革命的试点工作。
