The Revolutionary Committee of Shunde County in Guangdong Province has resolutely implemented the latest directive of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The county has organized a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team consisting of over 70,000 people, including soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and militia members who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts. This team has been sent to various production brigades throughout the county to help promote the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines. The propaganda teams in the countryside have widely mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to combine this study movement with the active study and application of Chairman Mao's thoughts, the in-depth and sustained development of the revolutionary criticism, and the current struggle, criticism, and transformation. They have ensured that the study is thorough and deep, that the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi is thoroughly criticized, and that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is firmly established. This has greatly enhanced the class struggle and the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, accelerating the pace of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the countryside.

The "four-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in various production brigades have held large and small meetings, organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, visited households, and used various forms such as broadcasts, artistic performances, slide shows, and cartoons to repeatedly propagate the history of the struggle between the two lines to the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres. They have enthusiastically praised the correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and severely criticized the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, making the history of the struggle between the two lines known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. During the propaganda, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have investigated and studied the situation of implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, conducting education on the history of the struggle between the two lines, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the countryside. They have mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to further carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, closely linking the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines with the active study and application of Chairman Mao's thoughts, the in-depth and sustained development of the revolutionary criticism, and the transformation of one's worldview. This has made the mass movement of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines both lively and practical. With the help of the propaganda team, the Shenchun Brigade of Beiqiao Commune has organized large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously carried forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, and mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members to seriously study Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's discussions on the struggle between the two lines. They have recalled the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line since liberation, comparing the sweetness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with the bitterness of suffering from Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They have thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by Liu Shaoqi and, on this basis, seriously carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own brigade. Through the study, the poor and lower-middle peasants have greatly enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. With deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, they have set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the brigade, production brigade, family, field, and water conservancy project sites, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "self-reliance, self-management, and self-improvement," "work points as the key," and "material incentives" promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and fighting Liu Shaoqi's agents in this region to the ground. This has accelerated the pace of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

As the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines continues to deepen, the "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been further developed among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in Shunde County. The thought revolutionization of people has been greatly strengthened. The mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts is being pushed to a new high. The revolution has promoted production, and a wave of spring plowing and production, taking the Dazhai people as an example, is vigorously developing across the county.

    顺德县七万多人的毛泽东思想宣传队活跃在生产队
    让两条路线斗争史家喻户晓深入人心
    据新华社广州十四日电　广东顺德县革命委员会坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，组织了一支由解放军指战员、革命干部、贫下中农和民兵活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子组成的共有七万多人的毛泽东思想宣传队，到全县各生产队帮助深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动。各宣传队在农村里，广泛发动广大贫下中农把这一学习运动同活学活用毛泽东思想、深入持久地开展革命大批判以及当前的斗、批、改紧密结合起来，做到学得活、学得深，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线批得彻底，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线立得牢固，从而大大提高了广大贫下中农和革命干部的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，加快了农村斗、批、改的步伐。
    “四结合”的毛泽东思想宣传队在各生产队里采取召开大小会议，举办毛泽东思想学习班，挨户访问和运用广播、文艺演唱、幻灯、漫画等多种形式，向贫下中农和基层干部反复宣传两条路线斗争的历史，热情歌颂毛主席革命路线的英明正确，狠揭猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，使两条路线斗争史家喻户晓，深入人心。毛泽东思想宣传队在宣传中，对农村前段贯彻党的八届十二中全会公报，开展两条路线斗争史教育和斗、批、改的情况进行了调查研究，并发动贫下中农进一步发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论和实际相结合的革命学风，紧密联系本地区、本单位阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实际，把学习两条路线斗争史，同活学活用毛泽东思想、深入持久地开展革命大批判紧密结合起来，同改造自己的世界观紧密结合起来，使学习两条路线斗争史的群众运动开展得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。北滘公社莘村大队在宣传队帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大力发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，发动贫下中农和社员群众认真学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席有关两条路线斗争的论述，回忆解放以来毛主席无产阶级革命路线同刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的斗争，比执行毛主席革命路线的甜、受刘少奇反革命修正主义路线迫害的苦，彻底批判刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义黑货，并在这基础上，认真搞好本大队的斗、批、改。贫下中农通过学习，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。他们怀着对刘少奇的无比仇恨，在大队、生产队、家庭、田间、水利工地，处处摆开革命大批判的战场，把刘少奇及其代理人推行的“三自一包”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货批得臭不可闻，把刘少奇在本地区的代理人斗得落花流水，加快了斗、批、改的步伐。
    随着两条路线斗争史学习运动的不断深入，顺德县广大贫下中农和基层干部中无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动有了新的开展，人的思想革命化有了很大加强。全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动正在推向一个新的高潮。革命推动了生产，一个以大寨人为榜样的备耕生产热潮正在全县各地热火朝天地开展起来。
