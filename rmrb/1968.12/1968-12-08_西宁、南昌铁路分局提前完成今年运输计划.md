Inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary workers of the Xining Railway Bureau, with boundless proletarian affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, have redoubled their revolutionary zeal and launched a new high tide of seizing revolution and promoting production. They have completed their annual transportation and production tasks 43 days ahead of schedule.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Xining Railway Bureau have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and carried out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. They have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the railway department, and have broken the irrational rules and regulations that shackle productivity, thus greatly promoting the development of transportation and production.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued his latest instruction that "the working class must lead everything," it greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of the Xining Railway Bureau. They sent a large number of outstanding workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, entering schools and other superstructural units that had not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. Under the condition of fewer people and heavier tasks, the revolutionary workers who remained at their production posts bravely shouldered the double burden of revolution and production. They launched activities to pull one more car, load one more ton of cargo, repair one more car, and innovate one more technology, dedicating their loyalty to Chairman Mao. During a period when the transportation tasks were particularly heavy, the revolutionary workers made up their minds to overcome various difficulties, actively organize cargo sources, load cars in advance, and ensure the timely delivery of transportation materials. The workers in the locomotive department fully exerted their subjective initiative, pulled and ran fast, breaking the old framework set by the previous walking capitalists that each train from Lanzhou to Xining could only pull 1,400 tons of cargo. They created a new record of pulling 2,430 tons of cargo per train, greatly increasing the traction rate of the locomotives, and creating good conditions for completing and overfulfilling the annual transportation and production tasks ahead of schedule.

Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary workers of the Nanchang Railway Bureau have completed their annual cargo transportation tasks 30 days ahead of schedule and overfulfilled them. They also created a record of the highest car loading in the bureau on December 5.

The revolutionary workers of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with a focus on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have turned the surging revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into a fierce grasp of revolution and a rapid promotion of production. After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the workers held more than 400 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing more than 10,000 people to participate in the study. The entire bureau's revolution and production were carried out in a hot and lively manner, ensuring the completion of the annual cargo transportation tasks ahead of schedule.

The revolutionary committees at all levels of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," have fiercely grasped class struggle without wavering, mobilized the masses, thoroughly cleaned up the class ranks, and dug out deeply hidden class enemies. They have effectively foiled the enemies' attempts to sabotage the revolution and production, ensuring the smooth progress of transportation and production. At the same time, they have closely combined the struggle against the enemy with the revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, further raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers, and powerfully promoting the great development of transportation and production.

The revolutionary committees at all levels of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "downsizing and streamlining" and "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing is to link with the masses," have universally and seriously carried out downsizing and streamlining this year, reforming the overlapping administrative organs, reducing the number of revolutionary committee members by more than 70% compared to the old organs. At the same time, they have selected a batch of outstanding industrial workers to strengthen the leadership organs. The members of the revolutionary committees have carried forward the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses, gone deep into the production front line, learned from the workers, humbly learned from the masses, and studied and solved problems with the masses. Thus, the revolutionary committees have better played the role of a combat command center in seizing revolution and promoting production.
