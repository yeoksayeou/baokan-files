The revolutionary workers of the Tianjin People's Automobile Factory No. 3 have combined the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party with the study of Chairman Mao's works. This approach has deepened their understanding of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party and has raised the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level.

Since the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party began in this factory, the revolutionary committee of the factory, based on the suggestions of some veteran workers, guided everyone to combine the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party with the study of Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions. They believed that this approach would not only deepen the understanding of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party but also raise the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level. The factory revolutionary committee, in line with the current need to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, selected some articles from Chairman Mao's brilliant works as key points and organized the revolutionary workers to study them in connection with the actual struggle between the two lines. Now, whenever they study Chairman Mao's works, they always bring several questions to mind: Why did Chairman Mao publish this article at that time? What was the historical background of the struggle between the two lines within the Party at that time? What great role did this article by Chairman Mao play in guiding the revolution to victory, and so on. This method of study has greatly deepened the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and has also enabled a more profound study of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. The workers reflected that this method of study yields great results and is effective.

The workers further linked their study to the actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines within their own factory. They formed worker investigation teams and listed all the major events of the struggle between the two lines within the factory from the year it was established in 1960 to the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They provided these materials to the workers in the workshops and carried out a revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Recently, they used the materials from the struggle between the two classes and the two lines within their own factory to hold an exhibition on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Revolutionary workers at the exhibition site severely criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the factory who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "the extinction of class struggle," "expert management," "material incentives," and "profit-oriented management." The exhibition also displayed the abundant achievements made by the revolutionary workers under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The workers, in connection with the actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines within their own factory, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, becoming more attached to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and more hateful of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

In the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, the revolutionary workers placed themselves in the context of the struggle between the two lines, bringing their own problems and active thoughts in the struggle between the two lines to the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions. They said: "In the struggle between the two lines, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought can achieve new levels of understanding and application." Young drivers Liu Jiaxu and Guan Junjie, in connection with their own thoughts and actions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and reviewed the sharp and intense struggle between the two lines during the Cultural Revolution. They deeply realized that without awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one cannot firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and one might join the wrong side and do the wrong things. Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, they raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, becoming model workers. Some cadres who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution could not understand the masses' impact on them and had antagonistic feelings towards the masses. In the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, they focused on studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They realized that they had been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "tame tool theory" and had executed the bourgeois reactionary line, failing to correctly handle the relationship with the masses. They severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's black "Cultivation of the Self" and raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They deeply felt that without awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one would be like a blind man walking in the dark, politically confused.

    带着两条路线斗争的问题学习毛主席著作
    天津人民汽车三厂革命职工把学习两条路线斗争史同学习毛主席著作结合起来，既加深了对党内两条路线斗争历史的理解，又把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动提高到新的水平
    据新华社天津十七日电　天津人民汽车三厂广大革命职工把学习党内两条路线斗争史同学习毛主席著作结合起来，使全厂活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮。
    党内两条路线斗争史的学习运动在这个厂开展起来以后，厂革委会根据一些老工人的建议，引导大家把党内两条路线斗争史的学习同毛主席著作和毛主席一系列最新指示的学习结合起来。他们认为，这样做既能加深对党内两条路线斗争历史的理解，又能把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动提到一个新的水平。厂革委会结合当前学习两条路线斗争史的需要，从毛主席的光辉著作中选出一些文章做为重点，组织革命职工联系两条路线斗争实际，活学活用。现在，大家学习毛主席著作的时候，总要带着几个问题：为什么毛主席在那个时候发表这篇文章？当时党内两条路线斗争的历史背景是什么？毛主席这篇文章对指引革命走向胜利所起的伟大作用，等等。这样学习大大加深了对毛泽东思想的理解，同时也比较深刻地学习了党内两条路线斗争的历史。工人们反映这种学习方法收获大，见效快。
    工人们在学习的时候，更进一步同本厂的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实际挂上钩。他们组成工人调查组，把从一九六○年建厂一直到这次无产阶级文化大革命中厂内两条路线斗争的重大事件，都列出来，提供给班组的工人，开展了对刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判。最近，他们又利用本厂两个阶级、两条路线斗争的材料，举办了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争展览会。革命职工在展览会现场狠批刘少奇及其在本厂代理人推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货。展览会还展出了革命职工在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下所取得的丰硕成果。工人们结合本厂阶级斗争和两条路线斗争实际，活学活用毛泽东思想，越学对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越亲，对刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线越恨。
    革命职工在党内两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，把自己摆进去，带着自己在两条路线斗争中的问题和活思想，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们说：“在两条路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，才能学出新水平，用出新水平。”青年司机刘家绪和关俊杰，联系自己在无产阶级文化大革命中的思想和行动，学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，回顾了文化大革命中两条路线的尖锐激烈的斗争，深刻地认识到：没有两条路线斗争觉悟，就不能牢牢地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，就会站错队，办错事。他们在两条路线斗争史的学习中，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，成为五好工人。有的在文化大革命运动初期执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，因为受到群众的冲击，思想上搞不通，同群众有对立情绪。他们在两条路线斗争史学习运动中，重点学习了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》这篇光辉著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，认识到自己受了刘少奇“驯服工具论”的毒害，执行了资产阶级反动路线，不能正确地对待群众。他们狠批刘少奇的黑《修养》，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。他们深有体会地说：没有两条路线斗争觉悟，走起路来两眼一抹黑，政治上就是个糊涂人。
