The People's Daily published an article on November 19 titled "This Issue Can Be Discussed," which stated, "Some people believe that if teachers are assigned work points, it will lead to a lack of enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause. The main reason is: after work, commune members can gather firewood, but after class, teachers have to correct homework, prepare lessons, and do ideological work with students. They also have to take care of household chores."

I believe this view is incorrect. If someone becomes unsettled in their teaching duties because of work points, it shows they have not broken free from the confines of individualism and have not understood the profound significance of changing from receiving a salary to being assigned work points.

I am convinced that if good teachers who dedicate themselves to serving the people encounter difficulties in their lives, the poor and lower-middle peasants will surely notice and remember, and will enthusiastically help them solve their problems.

### 生活困难的顾虑可以消除

    生活困难的顾虑可以消除
    《人民日报》十一月十九日发表《这个问题可以讨论》一文，说“有少数人认为，教师记工分，就会产生对革命事业心不强的现象。主要理由是：社员下工可以拾柴禾，老师下课却要改作业，备课，做学生的思想工作，家务事不管也不行。”
    我认为，这种说法是不对的。如果有人因为记工分就不安心教学，这实际上是没有跳出个人主义的小圈子，没有认识到由拿工资改为记工分的深远意义。
    我相信，一个全心全意为人民服务的好教师，他们的生活如果发生困难，贫下中农一定会看在眼里，记在心里，并热情地协助他们解决。
