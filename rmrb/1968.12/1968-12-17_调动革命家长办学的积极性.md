Under the influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, many schools in the past operated in isolation, creating a situation where parents relied on schools and schools depended on parents. Teachers and parents often had no interaction.

After factories or neighborhoods took over the management of primary schools, it is important to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of revolutionary parents to participate in education, encouraging them to care about their children's education. Could we consider establishing a Revolutionary Parents Committee to work together with the school leadership in managing the school? Specific measures include: regularly holding Revolutionary Parents' Mao Zedong Thought study classes, exchanging experiences in managing and educating students, and praising good deeds by students. I believe this is a method of education that follows the mass line.

    调动革命家长办学的积极性
    在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的影响下，过去有不少学校是关门办学，形成了家长依靠学校，学校依托家长。老师、家长往往是“老死不相往来”。
    工厂或街道办小学后，应当充分发挥革命家长办学的积极性，使家长们关心对孩子们的教育。是否可以考虑成立革命家长委员会，和学校的领导相结合，共同管理学校。具体做法是：定期举办革命家长毛泽东思想学习班，交流管教学生的经验，表扬学生中的好人好事。我认为，这是群众路线的办学方法。
