	Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Go to the Countryside
	— Summary of a Discussion on Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions by Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Revolutionary Cadres, Intellectual Youth, and Urban Residents of Huaning County

	The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Intellectual youth should go to the countryside, receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, which is very necessary. Persuade urban cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high, senior high, and college to the countryside. Each locality should mobilize. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them," have been published. In Huaning City and countryside, there is a wave of excitement, and the broad revolutionary masses are studying and discussing it earnestly. Here, we publish the discussion summary of some poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, intellectual youth, and urban residents.

	The Path Indicated by Chairman Mao, We Will Definitely Follow

	Urban resident going to the countryside, Wang Xiulan, said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions have expressed the thoughts of urban residents like us who have settled in the countryside. From the bottom of my heart, I shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

	I was originally an urban resident and am already 55 years old. This May, I participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the neighborhood committee, studied the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and a series of great teachings. Chairman Mao said: To build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in productive activities. Chairman Mao's great teachings have pointed out the direction for our progress. I thought: I also have two hands, why should I live in the city and eat idly? So, I decided to go to the countryside to settle down and participate in socialist construction. I was the first to volunteer to go to the countryside in the study class. After I signed up, some people said I was just putting on a show and wouldn't really go to the countryside. Hearing these rumors, I did not waver. I have only one thought: Chairman Mao has pointed out a bright and happy path for us, I will follow Chairman Mao's lead. However, my daughter-in-law did not want to go to the countryside with me, saying it was not convenient, far from her parents' home, etc. The root of the problem was fear of hardship and labor. I told her, Chairman Mao calls on us to seize the revolution and promote production. We have two hands and should contribute to socialist construction. Fear of hardship and labor is not listening to Chairman Mao's words. I also told her about our family history. In the old society, we poor people almost starved to death, froze to death, and worried to death. I gave birth to ten children, but only four survived. If it weren't for Chairman Mao saving us, how could we have today's life? After persuading her several times, my daughter-in-law's thoughts changed, and our family happily came to the countryside. Later, I also persuaded my three brothers to come to the countryside. We all expressed our determination to follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life.

	Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Are the Best Teachers

	Intellectual youth stationed in Liuzhuang Commune, Qiaoke Village, Ao Wen, said: Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Intellectual youth should go to the countryside, receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, which is very necessary." Through settling in the countryside, I have received re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants and deeply realized the extraordinary wisdom of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	I am an intellectual youth who grew up in the city. Due to the poisoning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi in school, I developed a bourgeois ideology of looking down on workers and peasants and despising labor. This time, I went to Liuzhuang Commune, Qiaoke Village to be stationed. The poor and lower-middle peasants' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao deeply educated me.

	When we came to the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants held criticism meetings with us, severely criticized the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents, told us the village history and the situation of class struggle in the village, gave us revolutionary red books and portraits of Chairman Mao; let us use "Old Three Articles" as a weapon to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism. For example, when we were assigned to the home of old poor peasant Niu Shifu, we complained about the cave house being bad. Old poor peasant Niu Shifu discovered our active thoughts and took us to an old Red Army soldier's home, asking the old Red Army soldier to tell us the heroic deeds of the Red Army following the great leader Chairman Mao to make revolution. We received profound education. Looking at the old Red Army soldier's residence, comparing it with our own thoughts of fearing hardship and seeking comfort, we felt ashamed and realized: If we do not receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, it will be very dangerous to develop further. From then on, we cleaned the small cave house clean and tidy, respectfully hung the portrait of Chairman Mao and quotations on the wall, placed the red books on the table, and decided to live in the small cave house for life!

	Send Children to the Countryside

	Revolutionary cadre Liu Yaolong said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions have given us cadres a serious political task. Is it to keep our children in the city, living a life of ease with food and clothes readily available? Or is it to send them to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants? This is a big issue about cultivating what kind of successors. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and stresses." We should send our children to the countryside to grow in the practice of the three great revolutionary struggles in the countryside.

	Mobilizing children to go to the countryside is not an easy task. I have a daughter who is 15 years old and has always lived in the city. She thought the countryside was both bitter and dirty and did not want to go. I often did work with her, telling her about my long-term detachment from the countryside and the masses, and later, her thoughts changed, expressing a willingness to try going to the countryside. When my wife and several other children went to the countryside to settle down, she also went, but did not want to transfer her school records. After they settled in the countryside, under the education of poor and lower-middle peasants, my daughter's thoughts changed greatly. Recently, she has decided to transfer her school records from the city to the countryside.

	Welcome, New Community Members Who Have Come to Settle Down

	Poor and lower-middle peasant Zhang Shuyue from Zhongtan Village, Hequ Commune, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "All people in the revolutionary ranks should care for, love, and help each other."

	Recently, some intellectual youth and urban residents from Huaning County have come to our village to settle down. We, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, warmly welcome them.

	Intellectual youth and urban residents coming to the countryside to settle down is not just about increasing some labor force for the countryside. This is a long-term plan to prevent and combat revisionism and an important step to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas. Intellectual youth and urban residents coming to the countryside, we poor and lower-middle peasants, with strong proletarian feelings, first of all, care for them politically, hang the portrait of Chairman Mao and quotations in their cave houses, introduce to them the history of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in our village, introduce to them the miserable situation of our poor and lower-middle peasants being oppressed and exploited by the landlord class before liberation, and raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

	We also care about the lives of intellectual youth and urban residents who have come to the countryside to settle down. Before they came, the poor and lower-middle peasants had already vacated cave houses for them, laid out the kang (heated bed), arranged for grain and firewood, and sent people and vehicles to far away places to welcome them, tirelessly helping them move their belongings.

	In receiving intellectual youth and urban residents who have come to the countryside to settle down, we have done some work, but it is not enough. In the future, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instruction, "Comrades in the countryside of each place should welcome them," and do a better job of receiving new community members.

	Forever Follow Chairman Mao

	County Military Department Director and County Revolutionary Committee Director Fan Xingdun said: The great leader Chairman Mao has issued the latest instructions, and our entire county is in high spirits. We shout ten thousand times, ten thousand, ten thousand times: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest encouragement, greatest concern, and greatest education for our entire county.

	Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. In May this year, five residents of Chengguan Town proposed to go to the countryside to settle down. We believe their request is in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. The County Revolutionary Committee firmly supports this revolutionary action and has set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Chengguan Town to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and a series of great teachings, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. The entire county commended the revolutionary action of the five residents and called on everyone to learn from them. A wave of going to the countryside to settle down quickly arose in Chengguan Town, and revolutionary masses rushed to request to go to the countryside to settle down.

	After the latest instructions from Chairman Mao came from Beijing, our Revolutionary Committee immediately took action, held an all-night meeting to study and discuss, and formulated measures for implementation. Now, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are known to every household, and the entire county has launched a magnificent wave of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    听毛主席的话，到农村去
    ——会宁县贫下中农、革命干部、知识青年、城镇居民座谈毛主席最新指示纪要
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去”发表后，会宁城乡一片欢腾，广大革命群众认真学习，热烈讨论。这里发表的是部分贫下中农、革命干部、知识青年、城镇居民的座谈纪要。
    毛主席指引的路我们走定了
    下乡城市居民王秀兰说：毛主席的最新指示说出了我们在农村安家落户的城镇居民的心里话，我打心眼里高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    我原来是个城镇居民，已经五十五岁了。今年五月参加了街道举办的毛泽东思想学习班，学习了伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和一系列伟大教导。毛主席说：为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。毛主席的伟大教导指明了我们前进的道路。我想：我也有两只手，为什么要住在城里吃闲饭？便下决心到农村去安家落户，参加社会主义建设。我在学习班里第一个要求下农村。当我报名后，有个别人说我是假积极、做样子，反正是不会到农村去的。听了这些风言风语，我没有动摇，我只有一个心眼，毛主席给我们指出的是一条光明幸福的道路，我跟毛主席走定了。但是，我儿媳妇不愿意跟我到农村去，说到农村不习惯，离娘家远，不方便等，其实病根子是在怕苦怕劳动。我对她讲，毛主席号召我们抓革命，促生产，我们生有两只手，应该为社会主义建设出力，怕苦怕劳动就是不听毛主席他老人家的话。我还给她讲了家史，在旧社会，我们穷人几乎穷死、饿死、愁死，我生了十个娃娃，只活了四个。要不是毛主席救了我们，那有我们穷人的今天？劝说几次以后，我儿媳妇思想通了，我们一家就高高兴兴地来到农村。后来，我又把我三个兄弟动员到农村来了。我们都表示一定要跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
    贫下中农是最好的老师
    刘寨公社寨科大队插队知识青年敖雯说：毛主席最近指出：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。”我通过到农村安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育，深刻地认识到毛主席这一最新指示无比英明伟大。
    我是一个生长在城市的知识青年，由于在学校中受到刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，滋长了轻视工农、轻视劳动的资产阶级思想。这次到刘寨公社寨科大队插队，贫下中农无限忠于毛主席的感情深深地教育了我。
    我们来到农村，贫下中农和我们一起开批判大会，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人的滔天罪行，给我们讲村史和村子里阶级斗争的情况，赠给我们革命的红色宝书和毛主席画像；让我们以“老三篇”为武器，进行斗私批修。比如，当我们分配到老贫农牛世福家里时就嫌窑洞不好，老贫农牛世福发现我们的活思想后，便把我们带到一个老红军家里，请老红军给我们讲红军紧跟伟大领袖毛主席闹革命的英雄事迹，我们受到了深刻的教育，看看老红军的住处，对照自己怕艰苦、贪图安逸的思想，感到羞愧，使我们认识到：如果再不接受贫下中农的再教育，发展下去是非常危险的。从这以后，我们把小窑洞打扫得干干净净，恭恭敬敬地把毛主席画像和语录贴在墙上，把红色宝书放在桌上，决心要在小窑洞里住它一辈子！
    把子女送到乡下去
    革命干部刘耀龙说：毛主席的最新指示向我们干部提出了一项严肃的政治任务。是把自己的子女留在城里，过着饭来张口衣来伸手的清闲日子；还是把他们送到乡下去，接受贫下中农的再教育？这是关系到培养什么样的接班人的大问题。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”我们应该把自己的子女送到农村去，使他们在农村三大革命斗争的实践中成长。
    动员子女到农村去，不是一件容易的事。我有一个女儿，今年十五岁，一直住在城市里，她认为农村是既苦又脏，不愿意去。我经常给她做工作，给她讲自己长期脱离农村，脱离群众的教训，后来，她思想有了转变，表示要去农村试试看。当我爱人和其他几个娃娃下乡落户时，她也下去了，但不愿把学籍转下去。他们到农村落户后，在贫下中农的教育下，我女儿的思想就有了很大的变化。最近，她已决心把学籍从城市转到农村去。
    欢迎你们，下乡落户的新社员
    河畔公社中滩大队下中农张树跃说：毛主席教导我们：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    最近会宁县的一些知识青年、城镇居民到我们大队安家落户。我们广大贫下中农热烈地欢迎他们。
    知识青年和城镇居民到农村安家落户，这绝不是单纯为农村增加一些劳动力，这是防修反修的百年大计，是缩小城乡差别的重要步骤。知识青年和城镇居民到农村来，我们贫下中农怀着强烈的无产阶级感情，首先从政治上关心他们，在他们的窑洞里贴上了毛主席像和毛主席语录，向他们介绍了本大队的阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争史，介绍了我们贫下中农在解放前受地主阶级压迫和剥削的悲惨情形，提高他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    我们也很关心下乡安家落户的知识青年和城镇居民的生活。在他们未来之前，贫下中农就为他们腾出窑洞，盘好了炕，安排了口粮和烧柴，还派人派车到很远的地方去迎接，不辞辛劳地为他们搬运东西。
    在接待下乡落户的知识青年和城镇居民方面，我们虽然做了一些工作，但是还不够。今后，我们一定遵照毛主席“各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去”的教导，把接待新社员的工作，做得好上加好。
    永远跟着毛主席
    县武装部长、县革委会主任范行顿说：伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示，我们全县人民一片欢腾，我们千遍万遍地高呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！毛主席的最新指示，是对我们全县人民的最大鼓舞，最大关怀，最大教育。
    通过无产阶级文化大革命，广大革命群众提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。今年五月，城关镇五个居民，提出了到农村去安家落户的要求。我们认为他们的要求是符合毛主席教导的。县革委会坚决支持这一革命行动，在城关镇办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和一系列伟大教导，狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。在全县表扬了五个居民的革命行动，号召大家向他们学习。一个到农村安家落户的热潮迅速在城关镇兴起，革命群众纷纷要求到农村安家落户。
    当北京传来毛主席的最新指示后，我们革委会就闻风而动，连夜开会学习讨论，制订出落实的措施。现在，毛主席的最新指示已经家喻户晓，全县掀起了一个波澜壮阔的落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。
