Workers and students unite!
Overthrow the Fascist police!
The Italian people launch a new wave of anti-dictatorship struggle.
The reactionary regime's massacre of workers ignites massive public outrage, as a storm of strikes, class boycotts, and mass demonstrations sweeps across Italy.

New China News Agency, December 5th: Rome - The Italian reactionary regime's brutal order on December 2nd to have police shoot striking workers has sparked a new wave of struggle against the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. Over the past few days, a massive wave of strikes, class boycotts, and mass demonstrations has swept across dozens of cities across Italy. The entire Apennine Peninsula resonates with the battle cries of "Workers and students unite," "Oppose the dictatorial regime," and "Overthrow the Fascist police."

On December 2nd, the Italian reactionary regime brazenly ordered police to open fire on striking agricultural workers in Avola, Sicily, who were demanding wage increases. This bloody incident resulted in the deaths of two workers and injuries to over fifty others. Some workers were shot multiple times and remain in critical condition. The Italian ruling class's bloody atrocity has sparked immense outrage among the Italian people.

Outraged agricultural workers in Sicily braved heavy rain on December 3rd, using stones, felled trees, trucks, and tractors to build new barricades around Avola, blocking traffic. On the same day, workers from various industries in Sicily held a general strike to protest the government's atrocities, paralyzing the region. On December 4th, over twenty thousand workers and students from various locations gathered in Avola to participate in the funeral of the two murdered agricultural workers. Mourners carried the bodies of the two slain workers through the streets in a protest march. To mourn the workers who sacrificed their lives in the struggle and to protest the Italian government's atrocities, agricultural workers and many industrial workers across Italy held strikes on December 4th.

In the Italian capital of Rome, over forty thousand college and high school students who have been boycotting classes to oppose the decadent bourgeois education system held massive protest marches on December 3rd and 4th, expressing solidarity with workers opposing the Fascist atrocities of the Italian police. On December 3rd, several thousand students gathered at the Circus Maximus in Rome for a protest rally and then marched through the city center, completely blocking traffic. Their banners and signs read: "The government is a machine of oppression," "The police are executioners," "Oppose oppression," "Oppose the bosses' schools," and "We don't want to graduate into unemployment." They also shouted slogans outside the police barracks, protesting the police's killing of Sicilian workers. On December 4th, over thirty thousand college and high school students took to the streets again to protest the Italian ruling class. They angrily shouted, "Demand blood from the murderers." The students occupied all the buildings of Rome University.

Like other cities, Rome's streets were filled with slogans such as "Rise up against the dictatorial regime" and "Overthrow the Fascist police."

In Milan, Italy's second-largest city, workers held a general strike in the morning on December 3rd to protest the government's atrocities. In the evening, about eight thousand young workers and students carried red flags, singing "The Internationale," and held protest marches in the city center and outside the police headquarters. The reactionary regime dispatched large numbers of police to brutally suppress the demonstrators. Workers and students, undeterred by the violence, built barricades and bravely fought back against the police with stones.

In Naples, Italy's third-largest city, workers also held a strike on December 4th to condemn the government's atrocities. Over five thousand workers and students held a protest march in the city center, engaging in fierce battles with the police.

On the evening of December 4th, over a thousand workers and students held a protest outside the local government and police station. Many demonstrators held up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao.

In Genoa, northern Italy, workers held a massive strike on December 3rd, paralyzing the port and most enterprises. Over five thousand workers and students waved dozens of red flags, shouting slogans such as "Workers and students unite" and "The police are murderers," and held a protest march. Workers and students fought bloody battles with the police in front of the provincial government building. They used buses to build barricades and fought back against the police who used tear gas to suppress the crowd. Students also occupied the normal school and raised a red flag on the roof.

In Florence, a major city in central Italy, over seven thousand workers and students held red flags and shouted slogans such as "The police are murderers" in the city center on December 4th. They held protests in front of the mayor's office and the police headquarters. The demonstrators used clubs and stones to repel the large number of police who came to suppress them, smashing the windows of the mayor's office. Students occupied the classical literature institute and the normal school to protest the police's atrocities.

In Trento, northern Italy, students occupied a sociology department of a university to protest the Fascist police's shooting of workers in Sicily. Students also held protest marches, carrying half-masted red flags to mourn the workers who sacrificed their lives in the struggle.

In the northern Italian cities of Trieste, Rovigo, Pavia, Savona, La Spezia, Reggio Emilia, and Bologna, and in the central Italian cities of Massa, Carrara, Perugia, and Ancona, as well as in the southern Italian city of Bari and other locations, masses held strikes and protest marches.

Meanwhile, the Italian workers' struggle against the monopoly bourgeoisie's brutal exploitation and for their own rights continues to rise. Over a million railway and other industry workers in Rome and its surrounding areas held a twenty-four-hour strike starting from the early morning of December 5th, demanding full employment and wage increases, plunging Italy's heartland into chaos.

Workers in the port of Venice also held a general strike, halting the loading and unloading work of forty-seven cargo ships docked at the port.

Italian students' struggle against the decadent bourgeois education system and the government's suppression of the student movement is also intensifying. In more than ten cities, including Rome, Milan, Genoa, Pisa, Padua, Modena, and Catania, many universities have been occupied by students. In Milan, Ferrara, Avezzano, Catania, Pistoia, Campobasso, Bari, and other cities, high school students have also risen up to occupy schools, hold class boycotts, and protest marches, and have engaged in fierce battles with the police.
