The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, expanded, stated: "Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people adhere to the principles and policies of proletarian internationalism, unite with the true Marxist-Leninists of all countries, resolutely support the heroic Albanian people in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation to the end, and resolutely support the just struggles of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, against revisionism, and against the reactionaries of all countries." Every word and sentence expresses the will and aspirations of the Chinese working class.

After being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese working class, with hearts full of loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, work in the workshops with a global perspective. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, with our boundless enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, we are advancing with great strides, building our country into an even stronger socialist state, an even stronger state of proletarian dictatorship, and an even stronger base for world revolution. The stronger we build China, the greater our contribution to the world revolution will be.

After more than two years of the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Beijing Coking Plant, like the rest of the country, has a great situation, inspiring the people. Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered the hearts of the people, and revolutionary enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. Every worker in the plant does not let go of Chairman Mao's books, and their hearts do not stray from Mao Zedong Thought. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings in everything. Everyone treats the workshop and the machines as battlefields for criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi and criticizing revisionism. Workers see producing an extra batch of high-quality coke as adding an extra shell to the fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and adding more strength to support the struggles of the peoples of all countries.

Revolution is the locomotive of history. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution greatly promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking and drives the development of production. Our workers are vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously promoting production. Last year and the year before, our plant overfulfilled the state production plan. This year, despite increased tasks and reduced personnel, we completed the state production plan ahead of schedule by 22 days.

The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have boundless creativity. In the past, to install a power boiler in the power workshop, according to the bourgeois technical "authorities," it would take several weeks to complete. Today, with workers in charge, we kicked out the bourgeois technical "authorities" and completed the task with our own hands in just one day and one night. The coking workers proudly say: "Chairman Mao's teachings are in our hearts, our revolutionary enthusiasm is boundless. We carry the revolutionary classics with us, and we trample on all difficulties under our feet. We carry both revolution and production on our shoulders, and we will forever defend the country securely. Standing by the coke ovens, we look at the world, and we will march forward in revolution forever."

Today, the Chinese working class has made up its mind to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and uproot revisionism. This not only serves the interests of our own people but also strongly supports the world's revolutionary people. Only by building China into a truly powerful socialist state can we shoulder the internationalist duty of supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolutionary victory should aid the struggle of the people who are fighting for liberation, and this is our internationalist duty." We always remember that there are still many oppressed people in the world who have not been liberated, and they are engaged in arduous struggles. We have the responsibility to support them. We firmly believe that as long as the people of the world unite, dare to fight, are not afraid of difficulties, and advance courageously, then the whole world will definitely belong to the people.

    建设一个强大的世界革命根据地
    北京焦化厂工人　焦东升
    中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报指出：“在毛泽东同志领导下的中国共产党和中国人民，坚持无产阶级国际主义的原则和政策，同世界各国真正的马克思列宁主义者团结在一起，坚决支持英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民的反帝、反修斗争，坚决支持英勇的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底，坚决支持世界各国人民反对帝国主义、反对修正主义、反对各国反动派的一切正义斗争。”公报字字句句表达了我们中国工人阶级的意志和愿望。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命的锤炼、用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，心怀对我们伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，身在车间，放眼世界。我们正在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，以自己的冲天干劲和无穷智慧，满怀战斗豪情，加速步伐，把我国建设成为一个更加强大的社会主义国家，更加强大的无产阶级专政的国家，更加强大的世界革命的根据地。我们把中国建设得更强大，也就能够对世界革命作出更大的贡献。
    经过两年多轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，我们北京焦化厂和全国一样，形势大好，振奋人心。毛泽东思想深入人心，群众革命热情空前高昂。全厂革命职工人人手不离毛主席的书，心不离毛泽东思想，事事按毛主席的教导办。大家把车间、机器旁都当作批判大叛徒刘少奇、批判修正主义的战场。工人们把多产一炉优质焦，当作多增加一颗射向帝修反的炮弹，多增添一分支援世界各国人民斗争的力量。
    革命是历史的火车头。无产阶级文化大革命大大地促使人的思想革命化，推动了生产的发展。我们厂的工人狠抓革命，猛促生产。去年和前年，我们厂都超额完成国家生产计划。今年，在任务增加、人员精减的情况下，又提前二十二天超额完成了国家生产计划。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众有无限的创造力。过去我们动力车间上一台动力锅炉，按资产阶级技术“权威”那一套，得几个星期才能完成。今天，工人掌权，踢开了资产阶级技术“权威”，用自己双手仅仅花了一天一夜的时间就完成任务。炼焦工人豪迈地说：“毛主席教导记心间，革命干劲大无边。革命宝书随身带，天大困难脚下踩。革命生产一肩挑，永保江山牢又牢。身在焦炉看世界，革命到底永向前。”
    今天，中国工人阶级把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底、挖掉修正主义根子的决心已经下定了。这不仅符合我们本国人民的利益，而且对世界革命人民也是有力的支援。我们只有把中国建设成为一个真正强大的社会主义国家，才能肩负起支援世界各国人民革命斗争的国际主义的义务。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们时刻都记住，世界上还有广大的被压迫人民没有翻身解放，他们正在进行艰苦的斗争。我们有责任支援他们。我们坚决相信，只要全世界人民团结起来，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。
