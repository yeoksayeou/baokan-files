The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xin Hua Tsu in Hong Guang Commune, Yu Shu County, Jilin Province, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, have run a "poor stick-it-out" primary school with the "poor stick-it-out" spirit. The school, managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, has shown great vitality and achieved abundant results. The students have good thoughts, high consciousness, and are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They have never separated from productive labor.

The report says: In Hong Guang Commune, Xin Feng Brigade, Yu Shu County, Jilin Province, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xin Hua Tsu, a remote mountain village, have decided to run their own school at their doorstep under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

Xin Hua Tsu is a remote mountain village with 25 households of poor and lower-middle peasants. Before liberation, they had no rights or money, and none of them had gone to school; they were all illiterate. After liberation, they stood up politically and economically. However, they had not yet stood up culturally. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xin Hua Tsu longed to have their own school at their doorstep.

In July 1964, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xin Hua Tsu decided to establish a primary school in their own village. Under the leadership of demobilized soldier and Communist Party member Wang Fu Tang, they quickly formed a three-in-one committee for running the school, consisting of brigade cadres, representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the platoon leader of the militia.

The committee was established, but there were no classrooms, desks, teachers, or funds. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xin Hua Tsu, inspired by Chairman Mao's advocacy of the "poor stick-it-out" spirit, firmly said: "Wang Guo Fan's village had only three donkey legs, but it established a cooperative. We have 25 households of poor and lower-middle peasants and must establish our own school." With no teachers, they selected a returned educated youth, Wang Tie, who had undergone a year of labor training and came from a poor peasant family, to be the teacher. With no classrooms, poor peasant Wang Bi vacated a room in his own home. With no desks, they used pig troughs and window frames, and old poor peasants donated wooden planks from their own homes to make desks. With no blackboards, they used wooden boards smeared with "pot bottom ash" as substitutes.

Thus, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xin Hua Tsu, relying on the great thought of Mao Zedong, carried forward the "poor stick-it-out" spirit, did not spend a single penny of state funds, and started from scratch to establish their own school at their doorstep in October 1964.

As soon as the school was established, it presented a new appearance to the people. The first sentence of the first class every day is "Long live Chairman Mao." The first lesson of the opening ceremony is class education, inviting deeply suffering old poor peasants like Xing Bo Chuan to recall bitterness and sweetness; teaching students to write starts with writing "Long live Chairman Mao"; educating students with the ideas that "laboring people are the most glorious" and "labor creates everything." The school was organized into classes and platoons from the beginning, combining military knowledge.

This school is convenient for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The children of poor and lower-middle peasants can enroll without age restrictions, from as young as six or seven to as old as seventeen or eighteen. Teaching time changes with the farming seasons, more classes during the off-season and fewer during the busy season. Classes are not limited to the school, and some older students who cannot leave home due to family labor shortages are considered "unenrolled students." The teacher, regardless of wind or rain, insists on "delivering classes to the doorstep" every night. Six students also brought their younger siblings to school, studying while taking care of their siblings, allowing their parents to focus on production.

From its establishment to the present, the school has maintained its frugal and simple style. They taught classes on the kang (bed platform) in the homes of commune members for more than two years, and later built new classrooms themselves. The teaching equipment is still the original set. The students' exercise books are made by themselves, using both sides of the paper.

Facing this, bourgeois intellectuals shake their heads and say, "Rustic! Rustic!" The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "Rustic is the essence of us poor and lower-middle peasants, it is our heirloom."

Under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, the "poor stick-it-out" primary school in Xin Hua Tsu has shown great vitality and achieved abundant results. The 34 students in the school have never separated from labor and production. They are both primary school students and young farmers. They can write critical articles with a pen, herd pigs with a whip, farm with a hoe, and repair desks with an axe. Children aged 13 or 14 can plow and sow, and children aged 8 or 9 can weed and pull grass. They have learned labor skills and reduced the burden on the poor and lower-middle peasants. More importantly, they have cultivated successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The most distinctive feature of the students in this school is their good thoughts and high consciousness of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Eight-year-old poor peasant's son Jiang Shu Lin is an active member of the commune's study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Poor peasant's son Wang Xin studied for three years in a public primary school and was left in the third grade. A teacher in the public primary school said: "Wang Xin wants to advance a grade, unless 'the dragon roars three times and the tiger lays eggs.'" But Wang Xin returned to this school to study, learned to recite the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and learned to keep work points accounts. Poor peasant daughters Xing Su Qin and Su Gui Qin, who had long exceeded the enrollment age, insisted on participating in collective production during the busy farming season and studied in the school during the off-season and evenings. Both became key members of the brigade's study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and Su Gui Qin was also elected as the women's team leader. They are good students in the school, good commune members in the brigade, fighters in the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily say: "The people-run primary school is good, using Mao Zedong Thought to nurture new sprouts, both literate and martial, with high consciousness, no dynasty has had such a good school."

From the beginning of its establishment, the Xin Hua Tsu people-run primary school has taken class struggle as the foundation course, paying attention to the education of "power" at all times and in all places. In addition to often listening to old poor peasants telling family history and village history, students also study Chairman Mao's quotations on class struggle every day, criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the extinction of class struggle" every week, and sing the song "Never forget the bitterness of class struggle" all the time. The class struggle consciousness is strong. Eleven-year-old poor peasant's son Wang Ming Qi and two other students discovered that landlord Liu Gui Zhi was directing the water from his small plot of vegetables into the production brigade's field. They pointed at the landlord and said, "You black-hearted wolf, your heart is not dead, trying every means to restore the old society, we will never let you off!" The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "These students have planted the root of 'power' in their minds, can distinguish between good and bad people, and our poor people's country will be stable."

Chairman Mao said: "As long as these people take their destiny into their own hands and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they do not evade problems but solve them with an active attitude, any human difficulties can be overcome." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xin Hua Tsu have taken the stage of the school, taking a solid step with the "poor stick-it-out" spirit. Now they are rectifying and improving the school according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution, making the "poor stick-it-out" spirit more prosperous, and running the school better.

    榆树县新华屯贫下中农在毛主席无产阶级教育路线指引下
    用“穷棒子”精神办好“穷棒子”小学
    这所由贫下中农管理的小学显示出巨大生命力，取得了丰硕的成果；学生思想好，觉悟高，无限忠于毛主席，一直不脱离生产劳动
    本报讯　吉林省榆树县红光公社新风大队新华屯的贫下中农，在毛主席无产阶级教育路线的指引下，用“穷棒子”精神办起了一所“穷棒子”小学，在贫下中农的管理下，学校越办越好。
    新华屯是一个偏僻的山村，住着二十五户贫下中农。解放前，他们无权无钱，没有一个人上过学校，个个都是文盲。解放了，他们在政治上和经济上翻了身。但是，在文化上还没有翻身。新华屯的贫下中农渴望在自己的家门口，办一所自己的学校。
    一九六四年七月，新华屯的贫下中农下决心要在自己屯里创办一所小学。在复员军人、共产党员王福堂的串连下，很快成立了有队干部、贫下中农代表、民兵排长参加的三结合办学委员会。
    办学委员会是成立起来了，但是，要办学校，一无教室，二无桌凳，三无老师，四无经费，困难不小。新华屯的贫下中农在毛主席提倡的“穷棒子”精神的鼓舞下，坚定地说：“人家王国藩那个屯只有三条驴腿，就办起了合作社，咱们有二十五户贫下中农，一定要办起自己的学校。”没有教员，他们就推选贫农出身经过一年劳动锻炼的回乡女知识青年王铁作教员。没有教室，贫农王铂就腾出自家住的一间房来。没有桌凳，他们就把猪槽板、窗户框拿来，老贫农还把自家的木板送来，自己动手制作。没有黑板，就把面板抹上“锅底灰”代替。
    就这样，新华屯的贫下中农，靠伟大的毛泽东思想，发扬“穷棒子”精神，没花国家一分钱，自力更生，白手起家，于一九六四年十月在自己的家门口办起了一所自己的学校。
    这所学校一成立，就以崭新的面貌出现在人们的面前。这所学校每天第一节课的第一句话是“毛主席万岁”。开学的第一课是阶级教育，请苦大仇深的老贫农邢伯川忆苦思甜；教学生写字一开始就学写“毛主席万岁”；对学生进行的是“劳动人民最光荣”、“劳动创造一切”的教育。学校一开始就按连队编成班排，兼学军事知识。
    这所学校一切方便贫下中农，贫下中农子女入学，不受年龄限制，小到六、七岁，大到十七、八岁。教学时间随农时变化，农闲多学，农忙少学。上课不分校内校外，有一些年纪大的、家庭劳力少离不开的，就作为“没有入学的学生”，老师不论刮风下雨，每天晚上坚持“送课上门”。有六个学生还带自己的小弟妹上学，边学习边哄弟妹，使父母安心生产。
    这所学校从创办到现在，艰苦朴素的作风一直不变。他们在社员家的炕头上上了两年多课，后来自己动手修了新教室，教学设备还是原来那一套。学生的作业本都是自己订的，正面用完了又翻过来再用。
    面对这些，资产阶级知识分子摇头说：“土气！土气！”贫下中农说：“土气是我们贫下中农的本色，是我们的传家宝。”
    新华屯“穷棒子”小学，在毛泽东思想阳光普照下，显示出巨大的生命力，取得了丰硕的成果。在校的三十四名学生，一直不脱离劳动，不脱离生产，既是小学生，又是小农民。他们拿起笔杆会写批判文章，拿起鞭子会放猪，拿起锄头会种地，拿起刀斧会修理桌凳。十三、四岁的孩子会扶犁、点种，八、九岁的孩子会薅苗拔草。他们既学到了劳动本领，又减轻了贫下中农的负担。更重要的是培养了无产阶级革命事业的接班人。这所学校的学生，最大的特点是思想好，无限忠于毛主席的觉悟高。八岁的贫农儿子姜树林，是公社活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。贫农儿子王信，在公办小学读了三年书，留了三年级。公办小学一位教师说：王信要升级，除非是“龙叫三声虎下蛋”。但王信回到这所学校读书，学会了背“老三篇”，学会了记工分账。早已超过入学年龄的贫农女儿邢素琴、宿贵琴，坚持了农忙参加集体生产，农闲和晚间到学校学习，两个人都成为队里活学活用毛主席著作的骨干，宿贵琴还被选为妇女队长。他们既是学校的好学生，又是队里的好社员，既是斗私批修的战斗员，又是毛泽东思想的宣传员。贫下中农高兴地说：“民办小学就是好，用毛泽东思想育新苗，能文能武觉悟高，那个朝代也没有这样的好学校”。
    新华屯民办小学从建校开始，就把阶级斗争作为基础课，时时事事处处注意对学生进行“权”字的教育。学生除经常听老贫农讲家史、屯史外，还天天学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的语录，周周批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，时时唱“不忘阶级苦”的歌，阶级斗争观念强。十一岁的贫农儿子王明奇等三个小学生，发现地主刘桂芝正把自己小片菜地里的积水往生产队的地里放，他们当场指着地主鼻子说：“你这个黑心狼，心不死，想方设法搞复辟，我们坚决不饶你！”贫下中农说：“这些学生思想上扎下了‘权’字根，好人坏人会区分，咱们穷人的江山就稳啦。”
    毛主席说：“只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”新华屯贫下中农登上了学校的舞台，用“穷棒子”的精神迈出了坚实的一步。现在他们正根据毛主席关于教育革命的一系列最新指示，进行整顿和提高，使“穷棒子”精神更加发扬光大，把学校办得更好。
