The Soviet revisionist clique, deeply alarmed and anxious about the growing resistance of the domestic people, has recently made a decision to strengthen the reactionary police regime and intensify fascist rule within the country. This is yet another exposure of the brutal face of social fascism by the Soviet revisionist clique.

In recent years, the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique has continuously strengthened the state machinery under their control, including the military, police, prisons, and courts.

In July 1966, the Soviet revisionist clique established the "Ministry of Public Order of the Union Republics." Motorized police units were set up in major cities across the Soviet Union. The number of police officers also increased continuously. Plainclothes agents were deployed throughout the country, and many fascist concentration camps were established.

Recently, the Central Committee of the Soviet revisionist party and the Council of Ministers jointly issued a decision to strengthen police rule, changing the name of the "Ministry of Public Order" to the "Ministry of Internal Affairs" and declaring that they would "raise the standards for police officers." The Soviet revisionist clique decided to send a large number of people they deemed reliable into the police apparatus to "further strengthen the leadership of the police apparatus." The Soviet revisionist clique also instructed relevant departments in the decision to take "a series of measures" to "equip the police with technical tools." In short, the Soviet revisionist clique is intensifying their reactionary police regime to more brutally and openly suppress the broad masses of Soviet laboring people who are increasingly dissatisfied and resisting the Soviet revisionists.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The more brutal the oppression, the greater the resistance.

The Soviet revisionist clique's frantic efforts to strengthen their reactionary ruling machinery do not indicate their strength but rather further expose the paper tiger nature of their increasingly unstable and weak rule.

Since this year, the Soviet revisionist clique has intensified the restoration of capitalism domestically, ruthlessly suppressing and exploiting the Soviet laboring people; externally, they have vigorously promoted social imperialist policies, openly sending troops to invade Czechoslovakia. The internal and external policies of the Soviet revisionist clique are extremely unpopular, and their criminal acts have further awakened the Soviet people. The "Stalin Group" in the Soviet Union has raised the banner of overthrowing the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique and rebuilding the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Soviet people openly wrote slogans on the streets such as "Do not interfere with Czechoslovakia!" and "Occupying troops get out of Czechoslovakia!" Inspired by the thriving student movements around the world, the broad masses of Soviet youth are increasingly dissatisfied and resisting the Soviet revisionists. All this has made Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk extremely terrified and restless.

In recent months, the Soviet revisionists have repeatedly slandered the revolutionary student movements in various countries as "petty-bourgeois revolutionary," and taken a series of reactionary measures, attempting to strengthen ideological control over Soviet youth students. Now, the Soviet revisionists have made this new fascist decision, which once again shows their extreme terror and anxiety about the resistance of the broad masses of Soviet people against them.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The rampancy of all internal and external dark forces has caused national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows their last struggles, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory."

Whether it is strengthening police rule or strengthening ideological control, it is merely the struggle of the Soviet revisionist clique as their doomsday approaches.

    对国内人民日益强烈的反抗深感恐慌和不安
    苏修集团强化警察统治
    加紧镇压苏联革命人民
    新华社七日讯　苏修叛徒集团为了加紧镇压苏联革命人民，最近作出决定，强化反动的警察统治机器，加强国内的法西斯统治。这是苏修叛徒集团残暴的社会法西斯主义狰狞面目的又一次暴露。
    近几年来，勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团曾不断强化他们所控制的军队、警察、监狱、法庭等国家机器。
    一九六六年七月，苏修叛徒集团设立了“联盟共和国社会治安部”。苏联各大城市增设了摩托化民警部队。民警人数也不断增加。全国各地，便衣特务密布，还设立了许多法西斯集中营。
    最近，苏修党中央和部长会议在联名发布强化警察统治的决定时，把“社会治安部”改名为“内务部”，并叫嚷说，要“提高对民警的要求”。苏修叛徒集团决定把他们认为可靠的人大量派进民警机构，以“进一步加强民警机构的干部”。苏修集团还在决定中责成有关方面采取“一系列措施”，“用技术工具装备民警”。一句话，苏修叛徒集团正在加紧强化他们的反动的警察统治机器，为了更野蛮、更露骨地镇压对苏修日益不满和反抗的苏联广大劳动人民。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。压迫越残暴，反抗就越大。
    苏修叛徒集团拚命强化他们的反动统治机器，并不表明苏修的强大，相反进一步暴露了苏修统治日益不稳和虚弱的纸老虎本质。
    今年以来，苏修叛徒集团对内加紧实行全面复辟资本主义，残酷地镇压和剥削苏联劳动人民；对外大力推行社会帝国主义政策，公开出兵侵占捷克斯洛伐克。苏修集团的内外政策，非常不得人心，他们的罪恶行径进一步促进了苏联人民的觉醒。“斯大林小组”在苏联举起了打倒苏修叛徒集团统治、重建无产阶级专政的战斗旗帜。在苏修侵捷后，苏联人民公开在街头刷出了“不许干涉捷克斯洛伐克！”“占领军滚出捷克斯洛伐克！”等标语。在世界各地青年学生运动蓬勃发展的鼓舞下，苏联广大青年学生对苏修的不满和反抗也日益增长。这一切，使勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流感到极度的恐慌，坐卧不安。
    近几个月来，苏修一再诬蔑各国青年学生革命运动是什么“小资产阶级革命性”，并采取了一系列反动措施，妄图从思想上加强对苏联青年学生的控制。现在，苏修又作出这项新的法西斯决定，这再一次表明了他们对于苏联广大人民对他们的反抗是多么恐慌和不安。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”
    无论是加强警察统治也好，加强思想控制也好，都只不过是苏修叛徒集团在末日日益临近前的挣扎而已。
