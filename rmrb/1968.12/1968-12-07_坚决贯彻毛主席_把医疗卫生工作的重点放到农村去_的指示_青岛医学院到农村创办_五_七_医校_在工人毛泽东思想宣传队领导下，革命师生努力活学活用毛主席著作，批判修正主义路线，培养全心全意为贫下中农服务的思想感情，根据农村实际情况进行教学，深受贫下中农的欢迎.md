The workers' propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought stationed at Qingdao Medical College, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," has carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class. They have led the revolutionary teachers and students to leave the campus and go to the countryside to establish a "May 7th" medical school, providing valuable experience for the revolution in medical education.

To carry out education revolution in the countryside is a new thing in the leadership of the working class in the proletarian education revolution. Before the workers' propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought entered Qingdao Medical College, the revolutionary teachers and students of the college had also carried out education revolution and proposed many plans. However, since their starting point was not truly based on serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, their education revolution was not thorough, was reformist, and did not conform to the actual situation in the countryside. After the workers' propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought entered the college, they promptly discovered this problem and pointed out in a straightforward manner: Without revolutionary ideology, one cannot propose revolutionary plans. Intellectuals must unite with workers and peasants, accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly change their old ideas, and establish the resolve to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. The opinion of the workers' propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought was like a loud bell, breaking the dull atmosphere of Qingdao Medical College. Revolutionary teachers and students unanimously cheered and applauded. In early October, the workers' propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought led over five hundred revolutionary teachers and students, full of fighting spirit, into eight communes and thirty-two production brigades in Jimu County. Each commune was stationed by a platoon, which was also a "May 7th" medical school. The "May 7th" medical school was directly led by the workers' propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought and widely solicited the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants on school management.

Qingdao Medical College's establishment of a "May 7th" medical school in the countryside was warmly welcomed by rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, who beat drums and gongs to welcome the revolutionary teachers and students into the village.

The "May 7th" medical school took helping teachers and students to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly changing their old ideas, and establishing the sentiment of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants as its primary task. To cultivate the deep feelings of teachers and students for the poor and lower-middle peasants, the "May 7th" medical school, in addition to arranging for teachers and students to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought together with the poor and lower-middle peasants in class struggle, production struggle, and medical scientific experiments, also organized patients and those who had suffered from the persecution of the revisionist medical and health line to give reports to the teachers and students. They also let them criticize the revisionist educational line and medical line together with the teachers and students. Through these series of activities, the ideological sentiments of many students and some teachers have undergone great changes. Some students said: "We were born in the families of poor and lower-middle peasants and grew up in the countryside. Originally, we had feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants; but after going to the city to study for a few years, we no longer wanted to return to the countryside. Although we also shouted slogans about serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, in our hearts, we still wanted to become doctors wearing white coats in big city hospitals. This time, we not only want to blaze a trail of proletarian medical education in the countryside but also want to be 'barefoot doctors' in the countryside for life." Now, when the poor and lower-middle peasants fall ill, they always try their best to overcome all difficulties to provide thorough treatment and care. A model in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, military dependant Wang Zuosong, suffered from gastric ulcer malignancy and needed surgery. The students actively found ways to send him to the county hospital. The county hospital had no blood bank, so a student immediately donated 200 CC of blood to Wang without hesitation.

With the change in ideological sentiments, the problem of teaching became easier to solve. The "May 7th" medical school compiled teaching materials and conducted teaching according to the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the actual situation of diseases in the countryside. In the "May 7th" medical school, students underwent such profound changes: In the past, they revolved around "authorities," but now they proactively take rural health workers and experienced old farmers as their teachers; In the past, they spent dozens of yuan to buy a pile of "foreign books" and studied them day and night, but now they pay attention to discovering and researching rural treatment methods and prescriptions; In the past, they had both "specialties" and "departments," but now they learn whatever the poor and lower-middle peasants need. After a period of "treating, observing, and teaching," students quickly improved their medical skills. Now, they can treat most diseases. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "In the past, our commune had a 'foreign doctor' who could only treat eye diseases, and the masses looked down upon him. We like doctors who serve the poor and lower-middle peasants and can treat various diseases."

    坚决贯彻毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示
    青岛医学院到农村创办“五·七”医校
    在工人毛泽东思想宣传队领导下，革命师生努力活学活用毛主席著作，批判修正主义路线，培养全心全意为贫下中农服务的思想感情，根据农村实际情况进行教学，深受贫下中农的欢迎
    本报讯　驻青岛医学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导，发扬工人阶级彻底革命精神，率领广大革命师生，下楼出院，到农村创办“五·七”医校，为医学教育革命提供了宝贵的经验。
    到农村办学搞教育革命，是工人阶级领导无产阶级教育革命中的新事物。在工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻青岛医学院以前，这个学院的革命师生也曾搞过教育革命，提过不少方案。但是，由于他们的出发点没有真正建立在为贫下中农服务的基点上，所以，他们的教育革命是不彻底的，是改良的，是不符合农村的实际情况的。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学院以后，及时发现了这一问题，便一针见血地指出：没有革命化的思想，就提不出革命化的方案，知识分子不和工农相结合，不很好地接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，树立为贫下中农服务的决心，医学教育革命是搞不好的。工人毛泽东思想宣传队的意见象响亮的钟声，打破了青岛医学院的沉闷空气，广大革命师生一致欢呼叫好。十月上旬，工人毛泽东思想宣传队率领着五百多名革命师生，斗志昂扬地开进即墨县的八个公社三十二个生产大队。每个公社进驻一个排，同时也就是一个“五·七”医校。“五·七”医校由工人毛泽东思想宣传队直接领导，广泛吸收贫下中农对管理学校的意见。
    青岛医学院到农村创办“五·七”医校，深受农村干部和贫下中农的欢迎，他们敲锣打鼓地把革命师生迎进村去。
      “五·七”医校把帮助师生活学活用毛主席著作，由工农兵给他们以再教育，使他们彻底改变旧思想，树立为贫下中农服务的思想感情，作为首要任务。为了培养师生对贫下中农的深厚感情，“五·七”医校除安排师生在阶级斗争、生产斗争、医学科学实验中同贫下中农一起活学活用毛泽东思想以外，还组织病人和受过修正主义医疗卫生路线迫害的人给师生作报告，并让他们跟师生一起批判修正主义教育路线和修正主义医疗路线。通过这一系列活动，广大学生和部分教师的思想感情发生了很大变化。有些学生说：“我们生在贫下中农家里，长在农村，原来对贫下中农是有感情的；可是，到城里上了几年大学，就不再想回农村了。尽管口里也喊要为贫下中农服务，但心里想的还是到城市大医院里当个穿白外衣的大夫。这一次下来，我们不仅要在农村闯出一条无产阶级医学教育的路子来，还要在农村当一辈子‘赤脚医生’。”现在，贫下中农有了病，他们总是想方设法，克服重重困难，给以周到的治疗和护理。一位活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、军属王作松大爷，患了胃溃疡恶变，需要动手术，学生们就积极想办法把他送到县医院。县医院没有血库，一个学生就毫不犹豫地给王大爷输了二百CC血。
    思想感情变了，教学的问题就容易解决。“五·七”医校根据贫下中农的需要与农村发病的实际情况，编写教材，进行教学。在“五·七”医校里，学生发生了这样深刻的变化：过去围着“权威”团团转，现在主动拜农村卫生员和有治疗经验的老农为师；过去花几十元钱买一大堆“洋书”，天天死读硬背，现在注意发掘、研究农村治病的“土方”、“验方”；过去又分“专业”又分“科”，现在贫下中农需要什么就学什么。经过一段时间的“边治疗，边观察，边教学”，学生迅速地提高了医疗技术。现在，一般的病，学生们都能治好。贫下中农高兴地说：“过去，俺公社来了个只能看眼的‘洋大夫’，群众就很瞧不起他。俺们喜欢的是为贫下中农服务的、能看各种病的大夫。”
