The PLA propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought stationed at the Nangchang Rubber Factory, together with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, studied the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. They severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line on state power construction, which greatly promoted the struggle, criticism, and reform. This made the newly established Revolutionary Committee more closely connected with the masses, continuously consolidating, developing, and improving itself, and better performing the function of proletarian dictatorship.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Nangchang Rubber Factory, under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, it quickly completed major tasks such as streamlining the organization, transferring office personnel to the workshops, and reforming unreasonable regulations. However, not long after, the leading members of the Revolutionary Committee, under the pretext of "helping out" and "going on official business," called back the office personnel who had been transferred to the workshops. The PLA propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought believed that this was not just a matter of transferring a few people; in fact, the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line on state power construction had not been eradicated. They then, together with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, repeatedly studied the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the Party, helping everyone to realize that streamlining the organization was not only a revolution in state power construction but, more importantly, a revolution in ideology. Only by thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line on state power construction and continually breaking private interests and establishing public interests could the achievements in state power construction be consolidated.

Based on this understanding, the members of the propaganda team, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "apart from the leadership of the Party, the decisive factor is the six hundred million people. With many people, there are many discussions, high spirits, and great enthusiasm," together with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, went deep into the workshops. They held classes on Mao Zedong Thought, widely listened to the opinions of the worker masses on the state power construction of the Revolutionary Committee, and fully played the leading role of the working class in state power construction. Workers who have grasped Mao Zedong Thought best understand Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thoughts and apply the view of "two aspects" most actively. The worker masses not only affirmed the achievements in the work but also pointed out sharply that the Revolutionary Committee still had old habits in its actions. The Revolutionary Committee seriously studied the opinions of the masses and realized that old forces still existed within the Revolutionary Committee. The poison of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line on state power construction still often infiltrated the newly established Revolutionary Committee. If not handled well, it would still follow the old path. Here, the key is the ideological revolutionization of the members of the Revolutionary Committee. Once the ideological reform is relaxed, the old forces will inevitably "resurge."

The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee, in conjunction with their own thoughts, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line on state power construction, which was detached from the masses, bureaucratic, and unable to serve the people. One vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, who was a deputy factory director before the Cultural Revolution, still could not let go of his old "director's office" after becoming a leading member of the Revolutionary Committee. This time, he had a revolutionary outbreak from the depths of his soul, thoroughly uprooted the "self," and said, "Since I became the vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee a few months ago, although I have been studying and working with the worker masses every day, I am still very interested in that 'director's office' in my mind, which leaves a breeding ground for 'revisionism.'" He quickly removed that "director's office" from his mind. The members of the Revolutionary Committee also actively went to the workers to expose their private interests, fight against them, and listen to the opinions of the worker masses.

Because the Nangchang Rubber Factory timely solved the problems in the construction of the Revolutionary Committee, the newly established Revolutionary Committee has become more consolidated. Now, the personnel who were called back to "help out" have been transferred back to the workshops. The members of the Revolutionary Committee also implemented the "three-thirds system," which means one-third of the people go to the workshops for point-to-point work; one-third of the people basically insist on shift work; and one-third of the people handle daily work. In the past, the leading members of the Revolutionary Committee went to the workshops to work, first carrying their bags to the office for a visit, arriving later than the workers and leaving earlier. Now, they go to the workshops as soon as they enter the factory and work shifts with the ordinary workers. The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee work, study, and solve problems with the workers in the workshops, overcoming the past phenomenon of "the masses having to go upstairs to find someone, and the cadres not being able to solve the problems," and achieving "people are there, hearts are there, and the roots are deep, cadres and masses are heart to heart."

    南昌橡胶厂狠批刘少奇反革命修正主义政权建设路线
    革委会更加巩固发展朝气蓬勃
    本报讯　驻南昌橡胶厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队带着政权建设中的问题，和革委会同志一道学习党的八届十二中全会公报，狠批刘少奇在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线，大大推动了斗、批、改，使新生的革命委员会更加密切联系群众，不断地巩固、发展和完善，更好地担负起无产阶级专政的职能。
    南昌橡胶厂革委会成立后，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，迅速完成了精简机构、下放科室人员、改革不合理的规章制度等项重大任务。可是，时过不久，革委会领导成员又以“帮忙”、“出公差”的名义，把下放到车间的科室人员调了上来。解放军毛泽东思想宣传队认为，这不只是调几个人的问题，实际上是刘少奇在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线的流毒没有肃清。于是便和革委会同志一起，反复学习了党的十二中全会公报，使大家认识到精简机构不仅是一场政权建设上的革命，更重要的是一场思想上的革命，只有大破刘少奇在政权建设方面的修正主义路线，不断破私立公，才能巩固政权建设的已得成果。
    在这一认识的基础上，宣传队同志又遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大”的教导，和革委会同志一起，深入车间，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，广泛听取工人群众对革委会政权建设的意见，充分发挥工人阶级在政权建设中的领导作用。掌握了毛泽东思想的工人群众，最懂得毛主席的光辉哲学思想，对“一分为二”的观点运用得最活。工人群众既肯定了工作中的成绩，又尖锐地指出革委会在行动上还有旧习气。革委会对群众的意见，作了认真研究，认识到旧的习惯势力依然在革委会中存在，刘少奇在政权建设方面的修正主义流毒，还经常侵蚀新生的革委会，如果搞不好，还会走旧路子。这里，关键是革委会成员的思想革命化，思想改造一放松，旧的习惯势力就必然“回升”。
    革委会领导成员结合自己的思想，狠狠批判了刘少奇在政权建设方面高高在上、人浮于事、脱离劳动、脱离群众、能“官”不能民的反革命修正主义路线。革委会有一名副主任在文化大革命以前，是副厂长，当了革委会领导成员以后，仍然对他过去那个“厂长办公室”恋恋不舍，有事没事都到里面去坐一坐。这一次，他从灵魂深处爆发革命，狠挖了“私”字，他说：“我当革委会副主任几个月来，虽然天天和工人群众在一起学习、劳动，但思想深处对那个‘厂长办公室’仍然很感兴趣，这就给‘修’字留下了温床。”他很快从思想上搬掉了那个“厂长办公室”。革委会同志还主动到工人中去亮私、斗私，听取工人群众的意见。
    南昌橡胶厂由于及时解决了革委会建设中的问题，新生的革委会更加巩固。现在，调上来“帮忙”的人员已经重新下放到车间；革委会成员还实行了
  “三三制”，就是三分之一的人去车间蹲点；三分之一的人基本上坚持顶班劳动；三分之一的人主持日常工作。过去，革委会领导成员下车间劳动，先是提着提包到办公室转一遭，比工人上班晚，下班早。现在，他们进了厂就到车间去，和普通工人一样顶班劳动。革委会领导成员在车间和工人一起劳动，一起学习，一起解决问题，克服了过去“群众有事上楼找，干部解决摸不着”的现象，做到了“人在心在根子深，干部群众心连心”。
