Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the land,
The Cultural Revolution plays a victorious song.
It speaks of this year's July,
The summer harvest distribution in Shangweidian has just been completed.
There is a family named Zhang, an old poor peasant,
Who received more than two piculs of wheat.
Hastily, they ground it into flour,
Happily, they steamed it into bread.
Twenty-five large steamed buns were made,
No one was allowed to eat a single one.
This day, after dinner,
Grandma Zhang was so happy she couldn't close her mouth.
She took out five large plates,
And placed five buns in each plate.
Just as she was placing them,
Her granddaughter Xiaohong Bo rushed in.
Xiaohong Bo saw this and was unhappy,
Her heart was full of thoughts:
The Cultural Revolution sweeps away the "Four Olds",
The education for Grandma has been profound,
With the help of the PLA uncles,
She studied Chairman Mao's works,
She participated in the women's study class,
Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism was quite good.
Today, seeing her like this,
Could it be that superstitious thoughts have revived?
Xiaohong Bo thought more and more,
And angrily confronted her grandmother:
"Grandma!" "Yes?"
"I want to criticize you,
Your feudal thoughts are dreadful!"
"Go away, what criticism are you talking about,
You don't understand the situation, don't talk nonsense!"
"What? You don't humbly accept criticism,
You open your mouth to criticize me.
I'll go find Uncle Soldier Lao to tell on you,
And give you a good scolding!"
"Good, if you want to find Lao Soldier, go quickly,
I was just about to invite him over!"
"Bang!" Xiaohong Bo slammed the door and stormed out,
Grandma busily tidied up inside and out.
She polished the portrait of Chairman Mao until it shone,
And placed the Quotations from Chairman Mao neatly on the table.
Five plates of white buns were placed in the center,
A broken pot was placed under the table.
Just as she finished tidying up,
Lao Soldier came with a group of people.
There was the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee,
The soldier Jin Dongke who supports agriculture,
The militia company commander and political instructor,
And Grandma's husband, Zhang Aiguo.
They all knew what Grandma was doing,
But Xiaohong Bo did not know.
Xiaohong Bo stormed into the room,
And loudly said to her grandmother:
"Look! Uncle Soldier and the others are here,
Say what you have to say in front of them!"
Grandma hurriedly greeted everyone:
"Good, everyone is here, listen to me.
Attention! Salute to the great leader Chairman Mao!"
Then there was a salute and singing.
Xiaohong Bo saw this and thought to herself:
Why is Grandma doing this again?
Grandma looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao,
And pointed to the white buns on the table:
"Look! What is in the plates?
Everyone can see clearly.
Wheat growing on the mountaintop,
We have never seen this before.
This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought,
This is the new achievement of the Cultural Revolution.
We first report this new achievement to Chairman Mao,
And share our thoughts together."
Everyone agreed enthusiastically,
Zhang Aiguo stood up and said:
"Looking at the victory, I think of the past,
My heart is filled with anger.
In the past, this place was also like this,
Why couldn't it grow this?
It was all because of the traitor Liu Shaoqi,
He played all kinds of tricks and sold black goods:
He destroyed the collective economy,
He opposed the great construction in the mountains.
The black master issued black directives,
This made the little running dogs busy.
Just take our commune's capitalist-roader,
He poured cold water on us:
He said, 'Here the mountains are high and water is scarce,
The wind is strong and the land is barren;
You want to grow wheat,
That is a waste of seeds and will not bear fruit.'"
The old man spoke more and more angrily,
Grandma stomped her foot in anger:
"Pfft! This is sheer nonsense,
He wants us to reverse the course of socialism."
At this moment, Grandma picked up the broken pot and showed it to everyone:
"This, this is our family's begging pot from several generations..."
Immediately, a chorus of slogans arose:
"Remember the bitter class struggle, never forget the blood debt!"
"Never forget class struggle!"
The slogans echoed through the mountains.
Grandma continued with renewed spirit:
"I won't talk about the past, I'll talk about today.
Through this Cultural Revolution,
My understanding is profound.
We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao,
Following Chairman Mao, we will never go wrong."
Xiaohong Bo said: "Grandma is right,
Her thoughts have improved a lot.
You always think of Chairman Mao,
But I... I..."
Xiaohong Bo was so moved she couldn't speak,
Grandma turned and praised Xiaohong Bo:
"Grandma's thoughts have improved,
Thanks also to Xiaohong Bo.
You actively pointed out my shortcomings,
You enthusiastically helped me correct my mistakes."
Xiaohong Bo was a bit embarrassed:
"Grandma, Grandma, don't say that,
When it comes to helping you overcome shortcomings,
Uncle Soldier is much better than me."
Lao Soldier was a bit uncomfortable:
"What? Why are you turning the criticism towards me!"
Grandma said: "It should be turned towards you,
You are a true hero (thumbs up)!
You are the soldiers sent by Chairman Mao,
To support us in the mountains.
Every day you help us read the precious book,
And bring Mao Zedong Thought to our hearts.
We poor and lower-middle peasants have Mao Zedong Thought,
We fight against heaven and earth to achieve results.
Look now, large and small reservoirs are like stars in the sky,
Waterways wind around the hills,
This year, we grew wheat for the first time,
And achieved a bountiful harvest.
Our mountains have changed so much,
Lao Soldier, you should talk about it."
Everyone listened and applauded:
"Welcome, Lao Soldier, to speak."
Lao Soldier raised the precious book and spoke:
"Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do.
Chairman Mao said: 'Do not eat the old, create new achievements',
We must not stop on the road of progress.
'Grasp revolution, promote production',
And welcome greater victories."
As Lao Soldier's words fell,
Everyone eagerly shared their thoughts.
The more they spoke, the more excited they became,
They opened their throats and sang songs of praise:
"Dear Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts..."
Some sang and danced,
Some clapped and kept the rhythm.
Truly:
The sky is red, the earth is red, and the people are even redder,
Mao Zedong Thought composes new songs!

    毛泽东思想谱新歌
    （山东快书）
     辛红
    毛泽东思想照山河，
    文化大革命奏凯歌。
    说的是今年七月份，
    上苇甸夏收分配刚搞过。
    有一户姓张的老贫农，
    分到小麦两石多。
    急急忙忙磨成面，
    高高兴兴蒸成馍。
    大馒头蒸了二十五，
    谁也不准吃一个。
    这天吃过晚饭后，
    张大娘乐得嘴不合。
    她拿出五个大盘子，
    一个盘里放五个馍。
    那知道正往盘里放，
    闯进来孙女小红波。
    红波一看不高兴，
    心里不住在琢磨：
    文化大革命扫“四旧”，
    对奶奶的教育挺深刻，
    在解放军叔叔的帮助下，
    她学习了毛主席著作，
    参加了家庭妇女学习班，
    斗私批修挺不错。
    今天看她这个样儿，
    难道迷信思想又复活。
    红波越想越生气，
    冲着奶奶发了火：
    “奶奶！”“哎！”
    “俺今天要给你提意见，
    你这封建思想太可恶！”
    “去去去，你提啥意见，
    不了解情况别瞎说！”
    “什么？你接受意见不虚心，
    张嘴还想批评我。
    俺去找解放军解叔叔，
    狠狠地把你说一说！”
    “好，要找老解你快点去，
    俺正想请他来作客哩！”
    “啪！”红波气得摔门往外走，
    老大娘里里外外忙拾掇。
    毛主席像框擦得亮又亮，
    毛主席语录端端正正桌上搁。
    五盘白馍放正中，
    桌下边放着一只破锅。
    她这里忙得刚就绪，
    老解带来人一伙。
    有革委会的副主任，
    有支农战士靳东柯，
    有民兵连长和指导员，
    有大娘的老伴张爱国。
    他们都知道大娘为那桩，
    就是红波不晓得。
    红波气呼呼地进了门儿，
    冲着奶奶大声说：
    “看！解叔叔他们都来到，
    有话你就当面说吧！”
    大娘连忙打招呼：
    “好，大家来了听俺说。
    立正！向伟大领袖毛主席敬礼！”
    接着是敬祝和唱歌。
    小红波一看心暗想：
    奶奶这又是为什么？
    老大娘望着毛主席像，
    指着桌上的白面馍：
    “瞧！盘子里放的这是啥？
    大家一看就明白。
    高山顶上长小麦，
    我们从来没见过。
    这是毛泽东思想的大胜利，
    这是文化大革命的新成果。
    新成果咱先向毛主席汇报，
    一块把感想说一说。”
    大家齐说好好好，
    一旁站起张爱国：
    “嗯，看着胜利想过去，
    老汉俺心中窝足了火。
    过去这儿也是这样的地，
    为什么不能长这个？
    就是大叛徒刘少奇，
    他耍尽花招卖黑货：
    他把集体经济来破坏，
    他反对山区大建设。
    黑主子发出黑指示，
    这可忙坏了小娄罗。
    就说咱公社的走资派吧，
    他给咱尽把冷水泼：
    说什么：‘这里山高水源少，
    风大地赖沙子多；
    你们还想种小麦，
    那是浪费种籽不结果。’”
    老大爷越说火越大，
    老大娘气得直跺脚：
    “呸！这纯粹是混账话，
    是想让咱社会主义开倒车。”
    这时大娘端起破锅给大家看：
    “这，这就是俺家几代的讨饭锅……”
    顿时一阵口号起：
    “牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇！”
    “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”！
    口号声声震山岳。
    老大娘抖擞精神继续讲：
   “俺不说过去说今儿个。
    通过这场文化大革命，
    俺的体会很深刻。
    我们要永远忠于毛主席，
    跟着毛主席走永远不会错。”
    红波说：“奶奶说的全在理，
    思想比过去强得多。
    你一心想着毛主席，
    可是我……我……”
    红波激动得说不下去，
    大娘转身夸红波：
    “奶奶思想有进步，
    也要谢谢小红波。
    你积极给俺指缺点，
    你热情帮俺改过错。”
    红波有些难为情：
    “奶奶，奶奶你别说啦，
    提起帮你克服缺点，
    解叔叔比俺强得多。”
    老解有些坐不稳：
    “什么？咋又把矛头转向我！”
    大娘说：“就是应该转向你，
    你是响当当的数这个（伸拇指）！
    你们是毛主席派来的子弟兵，
    到俺山区来支左。
    天天帮俺们读宝书，
    把毛泽东思想送到俺心窝。
    咱贫下中农有了毛泽东思想，
    战天斗地出成果。
    看如今大小水库‘满天星’，
    条条水道绕山坡，
    今年第一次种小麦，
    就获得丰收好成果。
    咱山区变化这么大，
    老解你可得说一说。”
    大家听了齐鼓掌：
    “欢迎老解说一说。”
    老解高擎宝书把话讲：
    “毛主席咋说咱咋做。
    毛主席说：‘不要吃老本，要立新功’，
    咱们要在前进路上不停脚。
    ‘抓革命，促生产’，
    把更大的胜利来迎接。”
    老解的话音刚落地，
    大家又争着把感想说。
    越说心里越激动，
    放开喉咙唱赞歌：
    “敬爱的毛主席，我们心中的红太阳。……”
    有的边唱边起舞，
    有的鼓掌把拍节合。
    这真是：
    天红地红人更红，
    毛泽东思想谱新歌！
