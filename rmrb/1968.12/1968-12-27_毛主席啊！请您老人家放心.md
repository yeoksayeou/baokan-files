“For Chairman Mao, we will stand guard for a lifetime, keep watch for a lifetime, defend the island for a lifetime, and be ‘loyal’ soldiers for a lifetime!” This is the ironclad oath of the soldiers and officers of a certain unit stationed on a certain island far from the mainland. They brave the stars and moon, endure the wind and rain, face the fierce winds and high waves, treat the island as their home, regard hardship as honor, and with hearts red with loyalty to Chairman Mao, they have built the island into an impregnable fortress on the sea to defend Chairman Mao.

Once, to strengthen combat readiness, they were ordered to move to a desolate, uninhabited island. Before liberation, coastal fishermen had a folk song:
	The lonely island is a ghost gate,
	Ten thousand difficulties above and below.
	The wind is strong, the waves are high,
	The desolate island has no people.
	If the family has thin porridge,
	Don’t go to the wave-topped mountain.

But in the great era of Mao Zedong, the people’s warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought went up and stayed! There were no houses to live in, so they set up tents. The tents were blown away by the strong winds, so they slept in caves. During the dry autumn, fresh water had to be transported by ship. When the wind blew, the water transport ships could not sail. Each person had only two and a half cups of fresh water per day, which had to be used for cooking, washing faces, and washing clothes. When the ships could not come, they could not eat vegetables, so they dug up wild herbs to eat. Comrades proudly said:
	Wild herbs may be bitter,
	But the taste is truly fresh.
	Defending Chairman Mao,
	The heart is always sweet!

The entire company of soldiers and officers braved the dangers and hardships, endured the labor, stood on the island looking towards Beijing, kept the world revolution in their hearts, and day and night guarded the frontline of the East China Sea to defend Chairman Mao, defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and defend the safety of the people of the motherland.

Soldier Zhou Kunlong received five or six letters from home last year, saying that his mother was critically ill and urging him to return. What to do? He thought: “Returning home is important, but strengthening combat readiness, defending the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and defending Chairman Mao is even more important! No matter how big the family matter is, it is not as big as following Chairman Mao to revolutionize; no matter how serious the mother’s illness is, it is not as heavy as the responsibility of defending Chairman Mao.” He resolutely gave up the idea of asking for leave from the leadership. Soon, another letter came from home saying that his mother had passed away. Zhou Kunlong was deeply saddened. But when he thought of Chairman Mao’s great teachings, “Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it is thoroughly for the benefit of the people,” and that he was fighting to defend Chairman Mao, his heart became clear. He said nothing and continued to patrol and stand guard, vigilantly guarding the frontline of the sea defense.

Months passed, and the platoon leader discovered this problem when Zhou Kunlong was writing a letter. He talked to him and asked, “Why didn’t you tell the leadership about this matter?” He gazed at the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao with deep affection and said, “At present, the class struggle at home and abroad is extremely fierce, and the class enemies are always looking for opportunities to sabotage and disrupt. Our frontline island is the eyes of the motherland, the frontline position to defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Guarding this small island well is to defend Chairman Mao, to defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, this is the most important thing. The death of my mother, how can I not be sad? But her death is only a personal matter. Chairman Mao asked us to guard the island, we must let him rest assured!”

In front of the company’s position is the open sea, and enemy situations can appear at any time. To let Chairman Mao rest assured and ensure that they can be dispatched at any time to annihilate all invading enemies, every night the soldiers put their weapons and equipment by their beds and hug them. The more the nights of wind and rain, the more vigilantly they tread the winding paths on the mountains and by the sea, patrolling without missing a single suspicious point. Whenever the people of the motherland celebrate a festival, they guard the position with redoubled vigilance.

On the eve of National Day this year, good news came: Company Commander Xie Changdun was to represent the entire company to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, and the entire company immediately became excited. Every red heart was beating fiercely, and every smiling face was facing the red sun. Comrades said with tears of happiness, “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We frontline soldiers think of you day and night, you and we are heart to heart.” The company commander was about to set off, and all the comrades in the company saw him off to the beach, with countless reminders: “Company Commander, when you go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, be sure to shout ‘Long live Chairman Mao!’ for us many times! Sincerely wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Tell Chairman Mao to rest assured, the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are guarding the sea defense of the motherland day and night. If the enemy dares to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate it!”

    毛主席啊！请您老人家放心
      “为毛主席站一辈子岗，放一辈子哨，守一辈子岛，当一辈子‘忠’字兵！”这是驻守在远离祖国大陆的某岛上的某部羊毛洞连指战员的钢铁誓言。他们披星戴月，餐风饮露，迎狂风，顶恶浪，以岛为家，以苦为荣，以无限忠于毛主席的颗颗红心，把海岛建成了保卫毛主席的攻不破打不烂的海上钢铁堡垒。
    一次，为了加强战备，他们奉命进驻一个荒无人烟的孤岛。解放前，沿海渔民流传着这样一首歌谣：
    孤岛鬼门关，上下十万难。
    风大浪又高，荒岛无人烟。
    家有薄稀饭，莫上浪岗山。
    但是，在伟大的毛泽东时代，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士上去了，并且住下来了！没有房子住，就搭帐篷。帐篷被狂风卷走了，就睡山洞。秋旱季节，淡水全靠船运送，大风一来，运水船不能航行。他们每人每天只有两杯半淡水，做饭、洗脸、洗衣全靠它。船来不了，蔬菜也吃不上，他们就挖野菜吃。同志们自豪地说：
    野菜虽然苦，味道实在鲜。
    保卫毛主席，总觉心里甜！
    全连指战员就是这样不畏艰险，不辞劳苦，站在海岛望北京，世界革命记在心，为保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫祖国人民的安全，日夜守卫在东海最前哨。
    战士周坤隆，去年接连收到家中五、六封来信，说母亲病危，催他回去。怎么办？他想：“回家要紧，可是加强战备，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫毛主席更要紧！家庭的事再大，也没有跟毛主席干革命的事大；母亲的病再重，也没有保卫毛主席的责任重。”他毅然放弃了向领导请假的念头。不久，家中又来了一封信，说母亲已经病故。周坤隆十分悲痛。但当他想到毛主席关于“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”伟大教导，想到自己是在为保卫毛主席而战斗，心里就豁然亮堂了。他一声不响，照常巡逻放哨，警惕地守卫在海防前哨。
    几个月过去了，班长在他写信的时候发现了这个问题，便找他谈心，问他：“为什么这样的事情你不向领导讲呢？”他凝视着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，无限深情地说：“目前国内外阶级斗争十分激烈，阶级敌人时刻都在伺机破坏和捣乱。我们前沿小岛是祖国的眼睛，是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的前哨阵地。守卫好咱脚下这小岛，就是保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，这是最大的事。母亲的去世我怎能不悲痛？但她的死只是个人的事。毛主席叫我们守海岛，我们要让他老人家放心啊！”
    连队的阵地前就是公海，随时都会有敌情出现。为了让毛主席放心，保证随时出动，务歼一切入侵之敌，每天晚上，战士们都把武器装备放在床头，抱在身边。越是风雨交加的夜晚，他们就越警惕地踏着崎岖的羊肠小道，在山上、海边巡逻，从不放过一个可疑点。每逢祖国人民欢度节日的时候，他们都百倍警惕地守卫在阵地上。
    今年国庆节前夕，喜讯传来，连长谢昌堆要代表全连去北京见毛主席，全连立刻沸腾起来。颗颗红心在激烈地跳动，张张笑脸迎着红太阳。同志们含着幸福的泪花激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我们海防战士日夜想念您，您老人家和我们心连心。”连长就要动身了，全连同志送到沙滩，千叮咛，万嘱咐：“连长，到北京见了毛主席，一定要为我们多喊几声毛主席万岁！衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！告诉毛主席，请他老人家放心吧，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，日夜守卫着祖国的海防，如果敌人胆敢来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭光！”
