Japanese students continue their struggle against the decayed and reactionary bourgeois education system, repeatedly foiling the plots of the reactionary school authorities and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Miyamoto to sabotage the student movement.

In the face of the students' brave struggle, the reactionary school authorities in Japan have repeatedly failed in their brutal suppression of progressive students. On the 16th, they played a new trick to sabotage the student movement. On this day, the reactionary authorities of Nihon University took a part of the law school graduates to hotels, temples, and classrooms in some middle schools in the Kanto region, and took a part of the business school graduates to a temporary school building newly built on a mountain in the suburbs of Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture, attempting to coerce students into "resuming classes." However, these activities were strongly resisted by the students, and progressive students angrily pointed out that the school authorities' move was a despicable plot.

On the 15th, 4,000 students, workers, and citizens in the Tokyo area held a rally at the Yasuda Auditorium of Tokyo University. A representative of the Senior Class Struggle Committee said at the meeting that the senior class students were determined to stand on the side of the people and resolutely fight against the reactionaries to smash the school authorities' "resume classes" plot.

On the 14th, 4,000 progressive students at Chuo University held a meeting, at which a resolution was passed to start an indefinite strike throughout the school from the 15th, strongly protesting against the school authorities' brutal suppression of students.

A student in his speech emphasized, "We are determined to support the student struggles at Tokyo University, Nihon University, and more than 60 universities across the country, and to carry on our struggle against the decayed bourgeois education system and to smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' to the end."

In the process of fighting against the school authorities, the progressive students of Tokyo University once again foiled the "negotiation" plot of the Miyamoto revisionist group to bail out the school authorities. On the evening of the 15th, progressive students occupied the law school building where the "negotiation" was scheduled to take place, and held a meeting on the 16th to strongly condemn the Miyamoto traitor group's consistent sabotage of the university students' just struggle. A student said in his speech, "It is not through 'negotiation' but through struggle that we can achieve our victory."

The Miyamoto traitor group gathered a group of thugs to cause trouble on campus, and progressive students surrounded them and smashed their propaganda car. Their "negotiation" plot failed.

Recently, more than 6,000 young workers and students in Tokyo held a large-scale rally and demonstration to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and demand the return of Okinawa. The picture shows the demonstration parade waving the red flag of "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought."

    坚决抵制学校反动当局的“复课”骗局
    日本学生坚持斗争反对腐朽教育制度
    宫本集团破坏学生斗争的阴谋又一次遭到粉碎
    新华社十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本的大学学生继续坚持反对腐朽反动的资产阶级教育制度的斗争，一再粉碎学校反动当局和日共宫本修正主义集团妄图破坏学生运动的阴谋。
    在学生们的英勇斗争面前，日本大学反动当局对进步学生进行的残暴镇压一次又一次地遭到失败，十六日他们又玩弄了破坏学生运动的新花招。这一天，日本大学的反动当局把一部分法学部毕业生带到关东地区的一些旅馆、寺庙和中学的教室里，把商学部的一部分毕业生带到神奈川县川崎市郊山上新盖的临时校舍里，企图诱逼学生“复课”。但是，这些活动都遭到学生的强烈抵制，进步学生愤怒指出：学校反动当局的这一手是卑鄙的阴谋。
    东京地区四千名学生、工人和市民十五日在东京大学的安田讲堂举行集会，毕业班学生斗争委员会的代表在会上说，毕业班的同学决心站在人民一边同反动派坚决斗争，粉碎学校反动当局的“复课”阴谋。
    中央大学的四千名进步学生十四日举行集会，会上通过一项决议，决定从十五日起全校举行无限期的罢课，强烈抗议学校反动当局对学生的镇压暴行。
    一个学生在讲话中强调说，“我们决心声援东京大学、日本大学等全国六十多所大学的学生斗争，决心把我们反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，粉碎日美‘安全条约’的斗争进行到底。”
    东京大学的进步学生在和学校反动当局进行斗争的过程中，又一次粉碎了日共宫本修正主义集团策划的为学校反动当局解围的“谈判”阴谋。进步学生在十五日晚占领了预定举行“谈判”的法学部大楼，并在十六日举行集会，愤怒谴责宫本叛徒集团一贯破坏大学学生正义斗争的罪行。一位学生在讲话中说：“不是通过‘谈判’，而是通过斗争，才能取得我们的胜利。”
    宫本叛徒集团纠集了一批打手在校内进行捣乱，进步学生把他们包围起来，砸了他们的宣传车。他们所玩弄的“谈判”阴谋未能得逞。（附图片）
    日本东京青年工人和学生六千多人，不久前举行粉碎日美“安全条约”和要求收回冲绳的大规模集会和示威游行。图为高举“毛泽东思想万岁”红旗的示威游行队伍。
