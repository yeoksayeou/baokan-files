In Donggu Dazhai Brigade, Wengquan Township, Zulu County, Hebei Province, there is a young man known as the "Living Lei Feng." He is Ren Diangui, the brigade's barefoot doctor.

Ren Diangui, born into a poor peasant family, has been serving as a part-time farmer and part-time doctor since the end of 1965. Whenever the villagers call for him, he responds immediately: if called from the fields, he drops his tools and goes; if called from the dining table, he leaves his meal; if called in the middle of the night, he gets out of his warm bed at the sound of the call. His heart is always with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and he is constantly concerned about the patients.

To Serve the People Wholeheartedly

In the summer of 1967, Ren Diangui contracted "pulmonary abscess," and his condition worsened. After being examined by the county hospital, he was advised to be hospitalized for treatment. Just as he was about to complete the admission procedures, Ren Diangui thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "selflessness and devotion to others." He thought, "Can I just rest in the hospital because of a little illness and neglect the poor peasants' health?" No, no! He repeatedly declined the doctors' advice and returned to the village with the medicine provided by the hospital. With incredible willpower, Ren Diangui overcame the pain and continued to work despite his illness.

One night, the wife of village member Fu Endi suddenly fell ill. Knowing that Ren Diangui was also sick, they did not knock on his door to call him. The next morning, Ren Diangui learned about it and went to see her immediately. The patient was in critical condition and needed to be rushed to the county hospital for emergency treatment. After the stretcher bearers left, Ren Diangui could not rest easy. He forgot all about his own illness and rushed to catch up with the stretcher. When the bearers got tired, he took their place; when the patient's condition changed, he administered emergency injections. In this way, they covered over thirty miles in less than three hours and arrived at the county hospital's operating room. Unfortunately, despite all efforts, the patient stopped breathing. Ren Diangui returned home with a heavy heart, lying on his bed and thinking, "Why didn't Fu Endi call me in the middle of the night when someone was ill? This shows that I have not truly connected with the poor peasants heart to heart." From then on, he set a rule for himself: to make house calls twice a day, morning and evening, and to conduct thorough checks, no matter how busy he was.

An 88-year-old poor peasant, Fu Yan, who was a five-guarantee household member, suddenly developed "urinary retention." During Ren Diangui's first house call, Fu Yan said he had no illness. During the second visit, Fu Yan said, "I have a slight illness, but it's nothing serious!" and refused to let Ren Diangui examine him. Ren Diangui asked in detail about the old man's diet and any changes in his urine and feces, and repeatedly assured him that no matter what the illness was, he would find a way to treat him. Only then did the old peasant allow Ren Diangui to examine him. Seeing the old man's severe condition, Ren Diangui, without a thought for dirt or fatigue, did everything possible to catheterize the old man, up to five times a day. After more than half a month of continuous treatment, the old man's illness was cured. The old man was deeply moved and repeatedly said, "Good child, I will never forget your kindness!" Ren Diangui replied, "This is what our great leader Chairman Mao instructed me to do!" The old peasant, facing the portrait of Chairman Mao, continuously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Over the past two years, some poor peasants, grateful for Ren Diangui's treatment, offered him eggs, snacks, or invited him to meals, all of which he politely declined. Whenever villagers came to give him things, Ren Diangui would stand with them in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and together study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In this way, their proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao deepened, and Ren Diangui's awareness of serving the people increased day by day.

To Serve the People Completely and Thoroughly

Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, Ren Diangui's class consciousness and political awareness continuously improved, and his medical skills also advanced rapidly. He took Norman Bethune as his example, learning diligently and striving for excellence. He used the opportunity to visit county and commune health units for his own treatment to learn acupuncture. Afterwards, for the villagers' illnesses, if acupuncture could be used, he would not use medicine; if a cheaper medicine could cure the illness, he would not use expensive medicine. He always paid attention to implementing Chairman Mao's call for thrift and frugality, considering the villagers' needs carefully, and ensuring that they spent less money to get better, while also saving the country's medicine.

Due to Ren Diangui's hard work, the brigade members generally no longer needed to go out for medical treatment when they fell ill. However, women still had to go out to ask for midwives when giving birth. Ren Diangui seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Pay Attention to the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work." Chairman Mao taught, "To win the support of the masses, to get the masses to put all their energy into the battlefront, we must be with the masses, we must mobilize the masses' enthusiasm, we must care about the masses' pains and itches, we must sincerely work for the masses' interests, solve the masses' production and living problems, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of housing, the problem of clothing, the problem of childbirth, and solve all the problems of the masses." Chairman Mao's words made Ren Diangui determined to learn midwifery. After studying at the commune health station, he quickly mastered the skills. At the beginning, some villagers with feudal thoughts were reluctant to call him for midwifery, and a small group of class enemies took the opportunity to slander him. Some people with serious old thoughts also said things like "men delivering babies will bring bad luck" and "will bring misfortune," etc. However, none of this shook his determination to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Once, he helped Fu Enkuan's wife deliver a baby, working from nightfall to dawn, finally delivering the baby, only to find it was stillborn. The whole family looked at him, worried about the baby's life. Ren Diangui tried every means to perform artificial respiration on the baby. Several hours later, the baby cried. Fu Enkuan's family thanked him repeatedly. He returned home, ate a bowl of rice, and immediately went to work with his shovel. His mother, worried about him, advised, "You haven't slept all night, don't go!" He replied, "Labor is our poor peasants' duty. We are servants of the people. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, not fear fatigue, fight continuously, and be the people's 'ox' for life."

Over the past two years, Ren Diangui has always insisted on participating in collective production labor. If he could work a full day, he would; if not, he would work half a day; if he could squeeze out a few hours, he would work those hours. In 1967, excluding meetings, study, and medical treatment, he worked 146 full labor days, and this year he has already exceeded 100.

With Full Enthusiasm, Promoting Mao Zedong Thought

Chairman Mao taught, "The Red Army's fighting is not just for the sake of fighting, but to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and help the masses build a revolutionary government." Ren Diangui thought, "Can we just treat illnesses for the sake of treating illnesses?" No, treating illnesses must serve the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought. He turned the process of treating illnesses into a process of promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and turned the occasion of treating illnesses into a battlefield for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever a new directive from Chairman Mao came, he would propagate it to the masses with the fastest speed and highest enthusiasm, helping the villagers set up family Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Every time Ren Diangui went out for treatment, before examining the patient, he would first study Chairman Mao's quotations with the patient to understand their emotions. During the examination, he would use Chairman Mao's teachings to have heart-to-heart talks with the patient. After the examination, he would give the patient a relevant quotation from Chairman Mao. Ren Diangui said, "We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the entire medical process and direct our every action!"

    时刻想着贫下中农的好医生
    ——记河北涿鹿县温泉屯公社东孤山大队半农半医的“赤脚医生”任佃贵
    在河北省涿鹿县温泉屯公社东孤山大队，有一位被誉为“活雷锋”的青年人，他就是这个村的“赤脚医生”任佃贵。
    贫农出身的任佃贵，从一九六五年底担任半农半医的医生以来，社员啥时叫，他就啥时到：从地里叫，他放下劳动工具就走；从饭桌上叫，他撂下碗筷就去；半夜来叫，他一听到声音就离开热被窝。他的心紧紧地和贫下中农连在一块，时时刻刻关心着病人。
    为人民服务要全心全意
    一九六七年夏天，任佃贵得了“肺脓肿”病，而且病情越来越重，经县医院检查，决定让他住院治疗。正要办理入院手续的时候，任佃贵想起了毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的伟大教导。他想，我能有点病就入院休养，把贫下中农的病放在一边不管吗？不能，不能！他再三谢绝医生们的劝阻，带上医院给他的药回村了。任佃贵以惊人的毅力克服病痛，始终坚持带病工作。
    社员傅恩弟的爱人，一天夜晚突然得了急病，他们知道任佃贵也在病中，没有扣门来叫。天亮后，任佃贵知道了，马上去看。病人很危险，需要立即送到县医院抢救。抬担架的人走了，任佃贵怎么也不放心。他把自己的病忘得一干二净，紧紧赶上了担架。抬担架的人累了，他就换着抬；病人的病情有变化，他就给打急救针。就这样，他们不到三个钟头走完三十多里路，来到县医院的手术室。但是，经过多方抢救无效，病人停止了呼吸。任佃贵回到自己家里，心里一直很不安，他躺在炕上反来复去地想：傅恩弟为啥半夜有病人不叫我，这就说明我还没有真正和贫下中农心贴心。从此以后，他给自己规定了一条制度：每天一早一晚主动上门巡诊，不管多忙，也要重点巡查一遍。
    八十八岁的老贫农傅彦，是个五保户，突然得了“尿闭”病。任佃贵第一次去巡诊，他说没有病。第二次去巡诊，他说：
  “有点病，不要紧！”不让任佃贵检查。任佃贵进一步仔细问到老人的饮食怎样，尿便有啥变化，并且多次表示不管有啥病，一定想法给老人治疗，老贫农这才让任佃贵检查了他的病。看到老人的严重病状，任佃贵不知什么叫脏，不知什么叫累，想尽一切办法给老人导尿，最多时一天五次。经过连续半个多月的治疗，终于把老人的病治好了。这位老人非常感动，一个劲地说：“好孩子，我死也忘不了你的恩情！”任佃贵说：“这是伟大领袖毛主席让我这样做的！”老贫农面对着毛主席像，不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    两年多来，有些贫下中农因为任佃贵给治好了病，很感谢他，有的给他送鸡蛋，有的送点心，有的请吃饭，任佃贵都一一谢绝了。每次社员们来给他送东西，任佃贵就和他们一起，站在毛主席像前，共同学习一遍毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》。这样，他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情更加深了，任佃贵为人民服务的自觉性也一天比一天提高。
    为人民服务要完全彻底
    在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，任佃贵的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟不断提高，医疗技术也提高得很快。他以白求恩同志为榜样，不会就学，精益求精。他利用到县、社卫生单位看自己的病的机会，学会了针灸。以后，社员们得了病，凡是能用针灸治的，就不用药；凡是能用便宜的药治好的病，就不用贵重药。他处处注意贯彻毛主席关于勤俭节约的号召，替社员们打算得很周到，务必做到既让社员们少花钱看好病，同时叫国家也节省药物。
    由于任佃贵的努力工作，本大队社员有了病一般都不用外出求医了。但是，妇女生孩子还得出去请接生员。任佃贵认真学习了毛主席的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉著作。毛主席教导说：“要得到群众的拥护么？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生小孩子的问题，解决群众的一切问题。”毛主席的话，使任佃贵决心学会接生。经过到公社卫生所学习，他很快掌握了接生技术。开始的时候，一些有封建思想的社员不好意思叫他去接生，一小撮阶级敌人乘机造谣污蔑他，有些旧思想严重的人也说什么男子汉接生要“冲运”啦，要“败兴”啦，等等。但是，这一切都没有动摇他“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的决心。一次，他给傅恩宽的爱人接生，从摸黑折腾到天亮，好不容易把孩子接下来了，一看是个“死”的。全家人都望着他，关切着孩子的生命。任佃贵想方设法，给小孩做人工呼吸，几个钟头之后，孩子会哭了，傅恩宽一家人连连称谢。他回到家里吃了一碗饭，马上又扛起铁锨上工去了。他母亲心疼他，劝他说：“一夜没睡觉，不要去了！”他说：“劳动是咱贫下中农的本份。咱是人民的勤务员。咱要听毛主席的话，不怕疲劳，连续作战，当一辈子人民的‘牛’。”
    两年多来，任佃贵始终坚持参加集体生产劳动。他能出整工一定出整工，出不了整工出半工，能挤出几个钟头就出几个钟头工。一九六七年，他除了开会、学习、看病以外，实做劳动日一百四十六个，今年也早已超过一百个。
    满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想
    毛主席教导说：“红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的”。任佃贵想，难道当医生就单纯地为看病而看病吗？不，看病一定要为宣传毛泽东思想服务。他把看病的过程当成宣传毛泽东思想的过程，把看病的场合当作宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。毛主席的每一个最新指示传来，他都以最快的速度，最高的热情，宣传给群众，帮助社员举办家庭毛泽东思想学习班。
    任佃贵每次出诊，看病前都要针对病人的情绪同病人一起先学毛主席语录，看病中用毛主席的教导和病人谈心，看病后根据病人应注意的问题再送一条毛主席语录。任佃贵说：我们一定要用毛泽东思想统帅整个医疗过程，指挥自己的每一个行动！
