On the summit of the Tanggula Mountains, known as the "Roof of the World," there is a red road maintenance team. This is the Qinghai-Tibet Highway 107 Road Maintenance Team, composed of twelve Tibetan men and women.

The location of the 107 team is over 5,000 meters above sea level. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains, the team's quarters are built on the permafrost. The air is thin, the climate is harsh, and snow covers the ground year-round. The weather changes rapidly, often shifting several times in a single day. It might be sunny in the morning, but by afternoon, a blizzard could sweep in, bringing hail and snow. During the stormy season, the road can be buried under meters of snow. Despite these extreme conditions, the road maintenance workers of the 107 team, filled with boundless proletarian love for Chairman Mao, study and apply his teachings, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, unyielding will, and revolutionary optimism. They have been fighting on the Tanggula Mountains for years, bravely battling the blizzards and meticulously maintaining the road to ensure smooth traffic. They also enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to passing travelers, earning the praise of the masses.

Rooted on the Snowy Mountains

The twelve Tibetan men and women of this team have been stationed here since 1962. The conditions are harsh: food doesn't cook properly, and water doesn't boil. In winter, they have to fetch ice blocks from far away to melt for water. Some comrades have had moments of wavering. Vice-team leader Zhu Zhu, a former serf, initially thought about leaving the Tanggula Mountains. Comrades helped him, and together they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people. Mao Zedong Thought illuminated his path forward. He recalled the miserable life he endured under the old society. It was Chairman Mao who saved him from that suffering and gave him the happy life he now enjoys. Today, he stands on this battlefield assigned by his motherland, facing hardships, and thinking of leaving? That would be ungrateful. So, he decided to stay on the Tanggula Mountains forever, contributing his strength to the construction of the borderlands. From then on, he studied and applied Chairman Mao's teachings even more diligently, cleansing his mind of selfish thoughts, working wherever he was needed, and earning the praise of the people.

Most of the Tibetan men and women in this team come from impoverished herder families, each with a history of bitterness and tears. They studied Mao Zedong Thought, recalling past hardships and sweet moments, just like Zhu Zhu, their political awareness continuously improved. Everyone maintained a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause, meticulously maintaining the road. Every day, as soon as it was light, they rushed to the worksite, and only returned to the team's quarters under the starlight. They bought a tent themselves and, during the months when the road is most easily damaged, lived and worked in the snow-covered wilderness. Wherever they maintained the road, they moved the tent. The ten kilometers of road they maintained continuously improved in quality.

The hardships of their labor life tempered their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and cultivated their selfless spirit. Everyone worked diligently, with high morale, determined to take root, bloom, and bear fruit on the high mountains and snow-capped peaks.

In February of this year, an unprecedented snowstorm covered this section of the Tanggula Mountains. The comrades of the 107 team faced a formidable battle. As the blizzard began, they grabbed their shovels and rushed to the snow-covered mountains, battling the eight- to nine-level winds and flying snow. The heroic road maintenance workers did not retreat in the face of the raging wind and snow. Their hands turned blue from the cold, their feet swelled, and their clothes froze into "ice armor," but not a single person complained. Although the blizzard lasted for more than twenty days, through their tenacious struggle, they ensured a "snow corridor" remained open.

Serving the People Wholeheartedly

The comrades of the 107 team, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other," provided enthusiastic help and meticulous care to passing vehicles and travelers.

On the treacherous Tanggula Mountains, the ever-changing weather often obstructs traffic on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. One day in February, a platoon from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was stranded on the mountain by an unprecedented blizzard. Day and night, the howling winds and flying snow engulfed the entire Tanggula Mountains, with temperatures dropping to minus forty or fifty degrees. The lower sections of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway formed snow ridges several meters deep. The comrades of the third platoon had been stranded there for two days and nights. Some comrades had dizzy spells, blue faces, swollen hands, and were threatened by hunger and cold.

Upon hearing the news, the comrades of the 107 team, despite the vehicles not being within their jurisdiction, immediately grabbed their shovels and picks, braved the wind and snow, and rushed to the location where the third platoon's vehicles were stranded. At this point, the snow was falling heavier, and the wind was blowing stronger, making it hard to open one's eyes, breathe, or stand steady. But the wind, no matter how strong, could not match their resolve to rescue their comrades; the snow, no matter how deep, could not compare to the depth of military-civilian camaraderie. They sang "With resolute determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory," a song of Chairman Mao's quotations, and advanced against the wind and snow. Upon arrival, they were moved to tears by the scene of the PLA soldiers bravely battling the wind and snow. A military-civilian battle against the blizzard began.

On the oxygen-depleted summit of the Tanggula Mountains, even walking was breathless, and the intense labor made breathing even more difficult. But everyone's morale was high, and their hearts burned with passion. As soon as they saw the Mao Zedong badges on their chests, they were filled with boundless strength. They declared firmly: The vehicles will not come down the mountain, and neither will we! The PLA soldiers and the road maintenance workers fetched ice blocks from afar, melted them into water, heated it, and filled the radiators of the vehicles. When the vehicles couldn't start, they pushed and carried them. They dug a section of the snow road, advanced a bit, and so on. Some female comrades couldn't hold out, and everyone urged them to return to the team's quarters to rest, but no one was willing to leave the PLA or the fiery battlefield. Through the joint efforts of the military and civilians, dozens of vehicles finally safely crossed the danger zone.

One night, team leader Suona Riji, facing the vast white snow, habitually gazed into the distance to see if there were any vehicles stranded on the mountain by the heavy snow. Suddenly, he noticed the headlights of a vehicle on the road maintained by the 108 team in Tibet, shining but not moving. He immediately reported the situation to the other comrades. Everyone quickly dressed, grabbed their snow-clearing tools, and rushed to the location where the vehicle was stranded. It turned out to be a large passenger bus loaded with travelers, deeply stuck in the snow. The travelers were moved to see the road maintenance workers rushing to their aid in the dead of night. The road maintenance workers, without regard for their own fatigue, immediately joined the battle to dig out the vehicle. Some comrades, with weaker constitutions, gasped for breath after the hurried walk, with stars in their eyes. But their minds were on the safety of their class brothers, not considering themselves at all. They excitedly shouted: Even if we sacrifice ourselves, we must rescue the travelers down the mountain! The intense battle continued until the red sun lit up the snow peaks, and the passenger bus finally left the danger zone and moved forward. The travelers, with hearts full of gratitude, waved goodbye to them and praised the good workers educated by Chairman Mao.

There are many such incidents in the 107 team. Whenever they discover vehicles stranded on the Tanggula Mountains, regardless of day or night, or how harsh the weather, they rush to rescue them. The road maintenance workers say well: Serving the people is boundless, and wholeheartedly serving the people is the greatest happiness.

A Great School for Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought

This team's quarters on the snowy mountains is a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, a red stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the red sun in our hearts, and the Tibetan workers on the snow mountains love you dearly." This is what the workers of the 107 team love to say and sing the most. They are on the snowy mountains but think of Chairman Mao day and night. They paste the great leader Mao Zedong's portraits all over the walls of their dormitories and wear shining Mao Zedong badges on their chests. Everyone carefully sews a red book bag, inside which they place Mao Zedong's portrait, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao Zedong's works, always carrying it with them. Every day, when the sun rises in the east and the golden rays illuminate the snow mountains, they face Beijing and sing "The East Is Red" with all their hearts, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! When they set out for the worksite, they carry Mao Zedong's portrait and sing songs of Mao Zedong's quotations, marching forward on the sunlit road with their heads held high. They say: When we see Chairman Mao's portrait, it's as if Chairman Mao is commanding us to fight, and we are full of strength.

The workers of the 107 team take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, using Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to strictly demand of themselves. The more they are in the midst of the intense battle against the blizzards, the more they insist on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, learning wherever they go and using it wherever they are. They have been fighting on the wind-swept plateau for years, relying on Mao Zedong Thought.

The road maintenance workers of the 107 team not only study and apply Chairman Mao's works well but also enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to passing travelers and the masses.

In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of the 108 team in Tibet were divided into two different revolutionary mass organizations, with strong antagonistic sentiments and unable to unite for a long time. One day, part of one organization came to the 107 team. The comrades of the 107 team enthusiastically received the Tibetan guests and studied with them Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "Within the working class, there are no fundamental antagonisms of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to be definitely split into two diametrically opposed big organizations." The comrades of the 108 team were deeply moved and expressed their determination to quickly unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, jointly oppose the enemy, and forever follow Chairman Mao's instructions.

The Tanggula Mountains region is remote, and news is scarce, with newspapers often taking ten days or half a month to arrive. Whenever Chairman Mao issued new instructions, the comrades of the team would gather around the radio, listening repeatedly, and immediately climb the snow mountains and cross the rugged terrain to propagate among the masses. When the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the summit of the Tanggula Mountains, the workers of this team were excited, with boiling blood, and enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Vice-team leader Zhu Zhu, disregarding the swirling snow, immediately set out to the nearby tents to propagate to the herders. Comrades advised him to wait for the snow to stop, but he said: I grew up as a slave under the whip of the lord and headman. It was Chairman Mao who saved me from the fire pit. But Liu Shaoqi, that big villain, wanted us to go back on our path, suffer twice, I hate him to the core. Now Liu Shaoqi, that big villain, has been thoroughly overthrown, such a heart-warming piece of good news, how can I wait for the snow to stop before telling my Tibetan class brothers!

A red sun shines on the ice mountains, and red flowers bloom towards the sun. The heroic road maintenance workers of the 107 team, fighting on the wind-swept plateau, are advancing forward on the brilliant road indicated by Chairman Mao.

    胸怀红日化冰山
    ——记战斗在世界屋脊的青藏公路一○七养路道班
    在号称世界屋脊的唐古拉山顶上，有一个红色的养路道班，这就是由十二名男女藏族工人组成的青藏公路一○七养路道班。
    一○七道班所在的地方，拔海五千多米。四周雪山环绕，道班房就建筑在永冻层上。这里空气稀薄，气候奇寒，终年冰雪盖地，天气瞬息万变，往往一天里会出现几种气候。也许上午还是晴朗的天，下午就会刮起狂风，下起冰雹，飞起雪花。在暴风雪季节，有时公路就被数米深的大雪所淹没。就在这样极端恶劣的自然条件下，一○七道班的养路工人，怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，以高度的革命责任感、顽强的毅力和革命的乐观主义精神，数年如一日地奋战在唐古拉山上，英勇地同暴风雪搏斗，精心地养护着公路，保证了交通的畅通无阻。他们还热情地向过往旅客宣传毛泽东思想，受到广大群众的热烈赞扬。
    在雪山顶上扎根
    这个道班的十二名男女藏族工人，是从一九六二年起先后来到这个战斗的岗位的。这里煮饭不熟，烧水不开，冬季还要从远地搬来冰块化冰为水。有的同志思想曾发生过动摇。农奴出身的副班长朱珠，初来时脑子里出现过离开唐古拉山的念头。同志们热情地帮助他，和他一起学习毛主席有关为人民服务的教导。毛泽东思想象灯塔一样，照亮了他前进的方向。他想起在黑暗的旧社会，过着牛马不如的生活。是毛主席把自己从苦海里救出来，过上了今天的幸福生活。今天来到了祖国交给自己的战斗岗位上，条件艰苦些，自己就不想干了，这不是忘本吗？于是，他决定在唐古拉山永远留下来，为建设祖国的边疆贡献力量。从此，他更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，学一点，用一点，经常不断地清洗头脑中的私心杂念，那里活累到那里干，得到群众的好评。
    这个道班的男女藏族工人，绝大部分出身于贫苦牧民家庭，都有一部辛酸的血泪史。他们学习了毛泽东思想，忆苦思甜，也象朱珠一样，政治觉悟不断提高，人人怀着对革命事业高度负责的精神，精心地养护着公路。每天天刚亮他们就奔向工地，晚上披着星光才回到道班。他们自己买了一顶帐篷，在每年公路最易损坏的几个月内，就在野外的雪地里吃住。养路到那里，帐篷就搬到那里。他们养护的十公里公路，质量不断提高。
    艰苦的劳动生活，锤炼了他们对毛主席的无限忠心，培养了他们一心为公的崇高品质。他们人人安心工作，斗志昂扬，立志在高山雪岭生根、开花、结果。
    今年二月，罕见的大雪覆盖了唐古拉山顶的这一段公路。一○七道班的同志们，面临着一场艰巨的战斗。当暴风雪开始降临的时候，他们就扛上铁锹冲向雪岭，冒着八、九级的狂风和飞舞的大雪，展开了紧张的除雪工作。英雄的养路工们，在狂暴的风雪面前毫不退缩。他们的手冻青了，脚冻肿了，身上的衣服冻成了“冰甲”，可是没有一个人叫苦。尽管暴风雪延续了二十多天，但在他们的顽强战斗下，终于保证了一条“雪走廊”畅通无阻。
    全心全意地为人民服务
    一○七道班的同志们，遵照毛主席“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，对过往车辆和旅客给予热情的帮助和无微不至的关怀。
    在高峻的唐古拉山上，那险恶多变的气候经常阻碍着青藏公路的交通。今年二月的一天，解放军某部三连的汽车被一次罕见的暴风雪围困在山上。白天黑夜，寒风呼啸，大雪飞舞，整个唐古拉山笼罩在风雪弥漫之中，气温急剧下降到零下四、五十度。青藏公路的低处形成了条条雪岭，深达数米。三连同志们被围困在那里已两天两夜了。有的同志头发晕，脸冻青，手冻肿，饥饿和寒冷威胁着每个人的生命。
    一○七道班的同志们听到这个消息后，尽管汽车没停在他们所管理的范围内，但他们怀着对解放军无比深厚的感情，立即扛上铁锹、铁镐，迎着风雪，奔向三连停车的地点。这时，雪越下越大，风越刮越紧，使人睁不开眼，喘不过气，站立不稳。但是，风再大，也没有他们抢救亲人的决心大；雪再深，也没有军民情谊深。他们唱着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录歌，顶风冒雪前进。到达目的地后，他们被解放军战士们同风雪英勇战斗的情景感动得流下了热泪。一场军民奋战暴风雪的战斗打响了。
    缺氧的唐古拉山顶，走起路来都要喘气，紧张的劳动，更使人们呼吸困难。但人人斗志昂扬，心红似火。一看到胸前戴着的毛主席像章，浑身就充满了无穷的力量。他们发出了坚定的声音：车不下山，我们也决不下山！解放军战士和道班工人们从远处搬来冰块，化冰为水，再烧热，把一辆辆汽车的水箱灌满。汽车发动不起来，就人推肩扛。挖一段雪路，前进一程。有的女同志身体支持不住，大家几次劝她们回到道班休息，可谁也不肯离开解放军，不肯离开这火热的战场。经过军民齐心协力的奋战，几十部汽车终于安全越过了险区。
    一个深夜，班长索那日加迎着皑皑白雪，习惯地向远方眺望，看是否有被大雪挡在山上的车辆。忽然，发现在西藏境内一○八道班养护的公路上有汽车的灯光亮着，经久不前。他断定是汽车抛锚了，立即把情况告诉其他同志。大家迅速穿好衣服，带上挖雪工具，一溜小跑地来到车子抛锚的地方，原来是一辆满载旅客的大客车被深深地陷在雪地里。旅客们看见道班工人们在这深夜里急速地赶来，都非常感动。道班工人顾不得奔波的疲劳，立即投入了挖车扒雪的战斗。有的同志身体较差，经过紧急步行，气喘不止，眼里直冒金星。但他们心里想的是阶级兄弟的安全，丝毫没有考虑自己。他们激动地高喊：即使牺牲自己，也要把旅客抢救下山！紧张的战斗一直进行到红日照亮了雪峰，客车才离开险境徐徐前进。旅客们带着无限感激的心情，向他们频频挥手告别，齐声赞扬毛主席教育出来的好工人。
    类似这样的事情，在一○七道班是很多的。只要他们发现车辆被围困在唐古拉山上，不管白天黑夜，不管气候如何恶劣，总要前去抢救。道班工人们说得好：为人民服务是无限的，全心全意为人民服务就是最大的幸福。
    活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校
    这所雪山顶上的道班房，是一所活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，是一个宣传毛泽东思想的红色阵地。
    “毛主席呀，毛主席！您是我们心中的红太阳，雪山上的藏族工人无限热爱您。”这是一○七道班工人最爱说的话，最爱唱的歌。他们身在雪山顶，日夜想念毛主席。他们在宿舍的墙壁上贴满了伟大领袖毛主席的画像，在胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章。人人精心缝制了一个红色书包，里面装上毛主席像、《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作，时时带在身边。每天，当旭日东升，万道金光照亮雪山的时候，他们面朝北京，纵情高唱《东方红》，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！出发到工地去，抬着毛主席画像，唱着毛主席语录歌，昂首阔步行进在阳光灿烂的大道上。他们说：我们看到毛主席像，就好象毛主席在指挥我们战斗，浑身都是力量。
    一○七道班的工人，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，用毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民的教导来严格要求自己。他们越是在同暴风雪搏斗的紧张日子里，越是坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，走到那里，学到那里，用到那里。他们长年奋战在风雪高原，靠的就是毛泽东思想。
    一○七道班的养路工人们，不仅自己学好用好毛主席著作，而且热情地向过往旅客和群众宣传毛泽东思想。
    西藏境内的一○八道班的工人群众，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，分别参加了两个不同的革命群众组织，双方对立情绪较大，很长时间不能联合起来。有一天，一个组织的部分工人来到了一○七道班。道班的同志们热情地接待了西藏的客人，和他们一起学习毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”这一段最新指示，一○八道班的同志们很受感动，表示一定要在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下迅速联合起来，共同对敌，永远按照毛主席的指示办事。
    唐古拉山地区偏僻，消息闭塞，报纸往往十天、半月才能看到。每当毛主席发出最新指示，道班同志们就围坐在收音机旁，一遍又一遍地收听，并立即爬雪山，过峻岭，到群众中去宣传。党的八届十二中全会公报传到唐古拉山顶时，这个道班的工人心情激动，热血沸腾，热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”副班长朱珠，不顾风雪弥漫，立即出发到附近帐篷去向牧民们宣传。同志们劝他等风雪停了再去，他说：我是在牧主、头人皮鞭下长大的奴隶，是毛主席把我从火坑里救了出来。可是刘少奇这个大坏蛋要我们走回头路，受二遍苦，我恨透了他。现在刘少奇这个大坏蛋永远被打倒了，这样大快人心的好消息，怎么能等风雪停了再告诉藏族阶级兄弟呢！
  一轮红日照冰山，朵朵红花向阳开。战斗在风雪高原的英雄的一○七道班养路工人们，正沿着毛主席指引的光辉道路阔步向前。
