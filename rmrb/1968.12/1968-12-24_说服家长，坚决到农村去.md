	Urban youth comrades:

	I listened to the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao on the radio: "It is necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside, accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and have an understanding of the situation of the countryside. We must persuade city cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, or college to the countryside. The countryside should welcome them." My heart was filled with excitement. Chairman Mao's words touched the hearts of us educated youth.

	I moved from the city to the countryside to settle down in July 1965. During this time, I went through many struggles. My aunt and uncle work in Baoding, and my uncle is a cadre. They have no children. When I was eight years old, my aunt took me to Baoding to raise me and I studied there. For ten years, I lived in a comfortable environment, my body became pampered, and my thoughts became lazy, increasingly unlike the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "The Direction of the Youth Movement" and decided to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants. I also took Xing Yanzi and other educated youth as examples, patiently persuaded my aunt, and returned to the countryside.

	However, my aunt missed me very much and soon wanted to take me back. Should I return to Baoding or stay in the countryside? At this time, my thoughts were in a fierce struggle. Remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, I strengthened my resolve. Then I organized my whole family to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Direction of the Youth Movement." As we studied, we recalled past hardships and sweet memories, raising our class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. We all realized that whether I return to the city or take root in the countryside is a matter of which path to take and what kind of successor to be. In the end, my aunt's thoughts also changed. She not only did not take me back but also bought me Chairman Mao's works and repeatedly instructed me to listen to Chairman Mao's words and be a good descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Over the past few years, on the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, I have striven to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. I have received re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The old thoughts I brought from the old school and the city gradually decreased, and the thoughts and feelings of the working people increased day by day. The poor and lower-middle peasants encouraged my progress and selected me to attend the county and district conferences of active learners and appliers of Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. They also elected me as a member of the brigade revolutionary committee and the commune revolutionary committee, allowing me to participate in managing state affairs. I deeply feel that educated youth who truly follow Chairman Mao and work for the revolution, just like the poor and lower-middle peasants, are welcomed with both hands and loved by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

	From my personal experience, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are extremely correct and wise. This is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, a long-term plan to prevent revisionism, narrow the gap between urban and rural areas, realize the ideological transformation of intellectuals, and cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. I sincerely hope that urban youth will actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, "persuade urban cadres and other people," take immediate action, go to the countryside, settle down, and humbly accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Join the three great revolutionary movements, thoroughly transform your worldview, and use your own two hands to build a socialist new countryside.

    说服家长，坚决到农村去
    河北省固安县独流公社王明庄大队下乡知识青年　王金秀
    城市知识青年同志们：
    我从广播里听了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”我的心情十分激动。毛主席他老人家的话，一字一句都说到我们知识青年的心里了。
    我是在一九六五年七月，从城市到农村安家落户的。在这中间，经过了不少斗争。我大姑和姑夫在保定工作，姑夫是干部，他们没有孩子。我在八岁的时候，姑母把我接到保定抚养，并在那里上学。十年来，我生活在优裕的生活环境里，身子养娇了，思想变懒了，越来越不象贫下中农的子女了。后来我学习了毛主席的《青年运动的方向》等光辉著作，决心响应毛主席的伟大号召，走与工农相结合的道路。我还以邢燕子等知识青年为榜样，耐心说服了姑母，回到了农村。
    可是姑母对我十分想念，过不多久，又要接我回去。是回保定，还是坚持在农村？这时我思想上展开了激烈的斗争。想起毛主席的教导，我坚定了信心。于是又组织我的全家学习毛主席的《青年运动的方向》这篇光辉著作。边学习，边忆苦思甜，全家提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，都认识到我回城市还是扎根在农村，是走什么道路，是当什么样的接班人的大问题。最后，我姑母的思想也通了，她不但没有把我接走，还给我买了毛主席著作，一再嘱咐我要听毛主席的话，做贫下中农的好后代。
    几年来，在阶级斗争、生产斗争的第一线，我努力活学活用毛泽东思想，接受贫下中农的再教育。我从旧学校和城市里带来的那些旧思想渐渐地少了，劳动人民的思想感情一天天增多了。贫下中农鼓励我的进步，选我出席县和专区活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会。还选我当大队革委会和公社革委会常委，让我参加管理国家大事。我深深体会到，真正象贫下中农一样，一个心眼跟着毛主席干革命的知识分子，广大贫下中农真是手里捧，心里爱，是欢迎他们的。
    从我个人的体会，毛主席这一最新指示，是非常正确、非常英明的。这是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是反修防修的百年大计、千年大计，是缩小城乡差别，实现知识分子思想革命化，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径。我衷心希望城市里的知识青年积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，“要说服城里干部和其他人”，立即行动起来，奔赴农村，安家落户，虚心接受贫下中农的再教育，投入三大革命运动，彻底改造自己的世界观，用自己的两只手，建设社会主义的新农村。
