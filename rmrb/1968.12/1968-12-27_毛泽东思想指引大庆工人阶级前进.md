Daqing—this red banner personally raised by the great leader Chairman Mao has become even more vibrant and eye-catching after being tempered in the battles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Daqing workers—this advanced contingent of the Chinese working class—have become even more vigorous and spirited, with high morale, after undergoing the severe tests of the struggles between two classes, two lines, and two roads.

Bravely defending the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought: "The working class must lead everything."

The workers of Daqing feel deeply moved by Chairman Mao's latest directive, saying, "Chairman Mao's words have touched our hearts. For eight years, we have fought against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, against a handful of class enemies, and against the capitalist roaders within the Party, all to defend the leadership of the working class and the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought."

Indeed, the eight-year battle history of Daqing is magnificent.

Eight years ago, the workers of Daqing, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, gathered from all over the country with deep hatred for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. They developed the world-class Daqing Oilfield at high speed and high standards, blazing a bright path for China's self-reliant development of the petroleum industry.

"Once the wind rises from the earth, the bones of the brave will pile up."

However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and a handful of revisionist counterrevolutionaries saw the Daqing path as the biggest obstacle to their implementation of the revisionist counterrevolutionary line. They tried every means to reverse the correct direction of Daqing, spreading a large amount of revisionist poison.

The struggle between the two lines in Daqing was fierce. The workers of Daqing played a pivotal role in the intense struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads.

Workers recalled the early days of the oilfield battle. It was precisely when the traitor Liu Shaoqi was frantically opposing the Great Leap Forward and wanting factories and enterprises to "dismount" that Daqing Oilfield "mounted." On this vast wilderness, how did the Daqing workers build a modern oilfield? It was all thanks to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The workers said, "The sky above is clear, and the 'Three Articles' are the North Star; the wilderness below is vast, and the 'Two Articles' are the guiding lights. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no Daqing!"

In 1964, the great leader Chairman Mao issued a call to the people of the whole country: "Learn from Daqing in industry," affirming that the Daqing path is the correct path for China's industrialization. The workers of Daqing loved Mao Zedong Thought even more and studied it even more seriously. Mao Zedong Thought became the highest criterion for the thoughts and actions of the Daqing workers.

However, a handful of revisionist counterrevolutionaries did not give up. They changed their tactics, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, continuing to strongly oppose the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

In May 1965, the political instructor of the 1205 Drilling Team, Ye Derong, together with all the team members, summarized the experience of emphasizing politics over the past few years and shared it throughout the Daqing Oilfield. The entire oilfield saw a new situation of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. At this time, Liu Shaoqi's agent in Daqing jumped out, conducting a "job responsibility" inspection. He nitpicked, finding a pile of "problems," and convened a meeting of 5,000 people, fiercely criticizing Ye Derong and opposing the workers' study and application of Chairman Mao's works. He also wanted the workers to discuss how to "correct the direction."

Discuss? The workers discussed and reached a conclusion: food can be skipped, sleep can be skipped, but Chairman Mao's works cannot be skipped. This capitalist roader conducted three "job responsibility" inspections, but the workers still insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

One trick failed, another was devised. In the latter half of 1965, a black wind of "technical training" blew, impacting the study of Chairman Mao's works.

As soon as the black wind rose, it was met with resolute resistance from the workers. Pump worker Zhu Zhengfan was a skilled old worker. The capitalist roader saw that he was good at technology and asked him to practice "blind operation." Comrade Zhu said, "Blind, blind, even the correct political direction is not clear!" He resolutely refused to practice. Many workers, after being "awarded" the title of "technical expert" by the capitalist roader, held Chairman Mao's works and said with tears, "I have not studied Chairman Mao's works well, and I have been evaluated as 'not emphasizing politics'!" Thus, under the workers' resistance, the "technical training" lasted only a few months and had to be called off.

The capitalist roader then tried to use material incentives, shouting about "rewarding merit." Suddenly, various awards and bonuses were flying everywhere. However, the Daqing workers with high political awareness were not fooled by this. In 1966, the 1202 Drilling Team created a world record of drilling 100,000 meters. The capitalist roader sent cigarettes, alcohol, and pork, and dispatched four high-level chefs to prepare a banquet for them. The workers of the 1202 Team said, "Chairman Mao's kindness is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea. We cannot repay it even in a thousand generations. We want the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we do not want these small favors. Please take them back!" This was the Daqing workers' response to the handful of capitalist roaders: material incentives do not work in Daqing!

The Daqing workers said, "Whether or not to study Chairman Mao's works is the big question of whether the Daqing red flag becomes redder or blacker." Under the guidance of this firm belief, the Daqing workers bravely defended the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, not giving an inch. When the refinery was just put into operation, the workers wrote Chairman Mao's quotations in the factory and hung quotation boards on the machines. The capitalist roader saw this and was afraid, covering the quotations with lime. However, they covered the quotations but could not suppress the workers' boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought. The workers used iron sheets, each two meters square, to write large-character slogans in regular script and hung them on the 60-meter-high coking steel frame. The next day, the 15 large characters "Highly Hold Up the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Advance Bravely" shone brightly in the rising sun.

This is the Daqing workers' loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought! The Daqing red banner, in the turbulent waves of the struggle between the two lines, flies high and shines brightly forever.

The Main Force of the Cultural Revolution

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Just when a handful of capitalist roaders in Daqing were fiercely opposing the workers' study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and the struggle between the two lines in Daqing was very intense, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, began.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly exposed the class struggle cover in Daqing, and a grand-scale class confrontation on an unprecedented scale unfolded across the vast oilfield!

The Daqing workers saw clearly that those obstructing them from studying Chairman Mao's works were a handful of capitalist roaders in power. The flames of anger immediately surged. In an instant, millions of revolutionary big-character posters swept Liu Shaoqi's agents in Daqing off their feet.

A handful of class enemies suffered heavy blows and, like a wounded evil wolf, struggled desperately. They played a vicious trick: "Half the people leave, close the wells, and sweep the lines."

Close the wells! These two words struck the hearts of the Daqing workers like a heavy hammer!

Close the wells, which means cutting off the major artery of the socialist economy, allowing imperialism and revisionism to strangle us again!

Close the wells, which is the shame of the Daqing workers, and there has never been such a record in the glorious history of the Daqing battle!

"We cannot close the wells!" The Daqing workers said firmly, "Grasp revolution, promote production, this is Chairman Mao's order, we will carry it out; the well site is the battlefield, we will not leave an inch."

They immediately took action, the refinery workers issued an emergency appeal; the drilling and oil extraction workers carried out emergency mobilization...

Some young people were deceived by the capitalist roaders and left their posts, and the workers immediately filled the vacant posts. Old drilling worker Liang Guangbin was resting at home with hepatitis, but when he heard that the capitalist roaders wanted to stop production, he could no longer stay at home. He returned to the well site with his illness to take over the post.

Thus, the Daqing workers ensured that the oilfield did not stop producing oil for a single minute, strongly supporting the victorious advance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." The Daqing workers, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism of the revisionist counterrevolutionary line pursued by the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Daqing. The flames of criticism burned across the oilfield.

On December 31, 1966, tens of thousands of workers and Red Guards gathered to hold the largest meeting in the history of the Daqing oilfield battle. They exposed a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and carried out a profound criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line.

In front of the rows of temporary houses at the Red Second Joint Station construction site, there stood revolutionary criticism columns. The treacherous, spy, and traitor Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary words and deeds were displayed one by one. Off-duty workers, with oil mud still on their hands and work clothes not changed, gathered around, criticizing Liu Shaoqi above and the capitalist roaders below, carrying out revolutionary criticism. The Oil Construction Fourth Brigade had just arrived at this construction site, and it took more than three hours to travel from the living quarters to here every day. Thus, apart from insisting on production, there was not much time left. The workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Grasp revolution, promote production" and decided to move to this wilderness to settle down. From then on, they worked on the machines during the day and carried out criticism at night. During the construction period, they exposed the capitalist roaders in this wilderness, held hundreds of revolutionary criticism meetings, greatly raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and achieved double victories in revolution and production.

In the Oil Construction Command, there were five female workers who were far from the organization and worked alone, insisting on eight hours of production and carrying out criticism in their spare time, and conducting investigations and research on holidays.

Once, the Thirteenth Team of the Transport West Station set out in the rain to execute an emergency task. The entire journey was through rural paths, and the car would get stuck in the mud. The workers pushed the car step by step, fighting for three days and two nights, eating only two meals. Even under such difficult conditions, they insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism, studying Chairman Mao's works in the rain, and fiercely criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's theory of "merging public and private interests."

The heroic Daqing workers are like this, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments step by step, no matter how fierce the winds and waves, they do not sway, and they advance bravely.

Fully Exerting Leadership

The Daqing workers, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly believe in one truth: following Chairman Mao is victory.

During the Cultural Revolution, the Daqing workers listened to the great leader Chairman Mao's voice from Beijing every day; they listened to the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. The Daqing workers seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest directives and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives.

On May 31 of this year, the Daqing Revolutionary Committee was established, and the vast oil sea was in jubilation.

However, the class struggle did not stop, and the struggle continued fiercely.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Drilling Command, some old organizations had not been reformed. There were 26 departments and 353 people there, with 85 cadres at the department level and above. The old organization still retained a set of old frameworks, old habits, and old styles. After the Revolutionary Committee was established, some daily work still had to be handled through the old organization. Thus, sharp contradictions emerged: the resolutions of the Revolutionary Committee were always discounted by the old organization!

The Revolutionary Committee wanted to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but the old organization became an obstacle!

The old organization must be reformed, but the resistance was great.

Why was there such great resistance?

The workers pointed out sharply: "This is a sharp class struggle. The focus of the struggle is still the issue of power."

The workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directives: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative organizations, streamline and strengthen the leadership, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." They said, "We will resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's directives. To consolidate the newly established Revolutionary Committee, we workers must enter the offices and lead them in struggle, criticism, and reform!"

The Fourth Brigade of the Drilling Command took the lead in action. One morning, they drove cars and brought hundreds of big-character posters written by the workers overnight to the drilling office. The office staff had not yet gotten up, and the big-character posters were already pasted all over the walls, corners, and corridors. In the afternoon, more than 200 workers from the drilling logistics unit, carrying red flags, marched into the office in an orderly manner. Then, the workers who fought in the wilderness also came. The office was filled with the surging waves of revolutionary criticism, with big-character posters one after another.

At the same time, for several consecutive nights, the Revolutionary Committee organized wired broadcast criticism meetings. More than 10,000 workers, family members, and students together fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist counterrevolutionary line in power building and enterprise management. On this basis, the workers, together with the revolutionary cadres in the office, carried out a thorough investigation of the class ranks, exposing a handful of class enemies in front and behind the scenes. Under the leadership of the working class, the old organization was thoroughly reformed. Now, this organization has only 39 people, half of whom are outstanding workers selected from the masses, full of vigor and strength.

The reform of the Drilling Command's organization opened the curtain for the high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform in the entire Daqing Oilfield. Soon, from the Daqing Revolutionary Committee to various grassroots Revolutionary Committees, organizational reforms were carried out, streamlining 90% of the personnel.

At this time, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out wisely: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work." The Daqing workers acted immediately. At that time, it was just after the completion of the construction of the South Nine Joint Station, preparing for production. In the past, for such large-scale modernized projects with oil, water, and electricity, it would take at least one and a half months to start production.

This time, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directives, the workers, after criticizing the revisionist line of "expert management" pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, decided to establish a worker-led production leadership group, with the second-level pump worker Wang Yongyi and the third-level oil construction worker Tian Weijia as the overall leaders, leading this production. The Daqing workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless. The worker-led production group unified their thinking, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, relied on the masses, and gave full play to the wisdom of the masses, carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary cooperation, overcoming various difficulties, and solving most of the problems in the production process on the spot. In the past, there were countless unreasonable regulations and systems in production, and workers had to report to five or six levels to open a valve. Now, such regulations and systems have been broken one after another. Therefore, the production time was greatly shortened, and some production management personnel were still considering the production plan and preparation work when the joint station had already successfully started production.

Now, the Daqing workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "the working class must lead everything," are organizing Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter more than 120 schools in the oilfield, as well as various research institutes and hospitals, taking on the great historical mission of leading the struggle, criticism, and reform of the superstructure in various fields. The Daqing workers, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are transforming everything in the image of the working class.

### 毛泽东思想指引大庆工人阶级前进

    毛泽东思想指引大庆工人阶级前进
    大庆——这面由伟大领袖毛主席亲手树立起来的红旗，经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，更加鲜艳夺目；大庆工人——这支中国工人阶级的先进队伍，经过两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的严峻考验，更加生气勃勃，斗志昂扬。
    勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的领导权“工人阶级必须领导一切”。
    大庆工人学习毛主席这一最新指示倍感亲切，他们激动地说：“毛主席的话，说到了我们工人的心坎里，八年来，我们同帝修反斗，同一小撮阶级敌人斗，同党内的走资派斗，就是为了捍卫工人阶级的领导权，捍卫毛泽东思想的领导权。”
    是的，大庆油田八年的战斗历程是波澜壮阔的。
    八年前，用毛泽东思想武装起来的大庆工人，怀着对帝修反的无比仇恨，从五湖四海会师大庆，高速度、高水平地开发了世界上第一流的大油田，为我国自力更生发展石油工业闯出了一条光明大道。
   “一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。”
    以大叛徒刘少奇为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子却把大庆的道路看成是他们推行反革命修正主义路线的最大障碍，千方百计要扭转大庆的正确方向。他们把黑手伸向大庆，散布了大量反革命修正主义毒素。
    大庆两条路线的斗争在激烈地进行着。大庆工人在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中起了中流砥柱的作用。
    工人们回想起油田会战的初期，正是大叛徒刘少奇疯狂地反对大跃进，要工厂、企业“下马”的时候，大庆油田靠什么“上马”？在这一片荒原上，大庆工人靠什么建设起现代化的大油田？靠的就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。工人们说：“头上青天一顶，‘老三篇’是北斗星；脚下荒原一片，‘两论’是指路灯，没有毛泽东思想就没有大庆！”
    一九六四年，伟大领袖毛主席向全国人民发出号召：“工业学大庆”，肯定了大庆的道路是中国工业化的正确道路。大庆工人对毛泽东思想更加热爱，他们学习毛泽东思想更加认真。毛泽东思想成为大庆工人思想和行动的最高准则。
    但是，一小撮反革命修正主义分子并没有从此罢休，他们改变了策略，打着红旗反红旗，继续大反活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。
    一九六五年五月，一二○五钻井队指导员叶德荣带着全队同志总结的几年来突出政治的经验，讲遍了大庆油田，整个油田出现了一个活学活用毛泽东思想的新局面。这时，刘少奇在大庆的代理人跳了出来，搞什么“岗位责任”大检查。他鸡蛋里挑骨头，找了一堆“毛病”，兴师动众，召开了五千人大会，大骂叶德荣，反对工人活学活用毛主席著作，并且要工人们讨论怎样“端正方向”。
    讨论就讨论！工人们讨论的结果，得出一个结论：饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席著作不能不学。这个走资派连续搞了三次“岗位责任”大检查，但是工人们照样坚持活学活用毛主席著作。
    一计不成又生一计，一九六五年下半年，又刮起一股“技术大练兵”的黑风，冲击着毛主席著作的学习。
    妖风刚起，就遭到了工人的坚决抵制。泵工朱正凡是一个技术熟练的老工人。走资派看他技术好，叫他练“蒙目操作”。朱师傅说：“蒙目、蒙目，连正确的政治方向都认不清了！”他坚决不练。很多工人被走资派“授予”“技术能手”的“称号”之后，捧着毛主席著作，含着眼泪说：“我没有学好毛主席的书，评了个
  ‘不突出政治’！”就这样，在工人们的抵制下，“技术大练兵”搞了几个月，就只好偃旗息鼓，草草收场了。
    走资派又企图拿物质引诱，叫嚷着要“论功行赏”。一时，五花八门的奖品、奖金满天飞。可是具有高度政治觉悟的大庆工人根本不吃这一套。一九六六年，一二○二钻井队创造了钻井进尺十万米的世界纪录。走资派送来烟、酒、猪肉，还派了四名高级厨师给他们操办酒宴。一二○二队的工人说：“毛主席的恩情比天高，比海深，我们千年万代都报答不尽。我们要的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们不要这些小恩小惠，你快收回去吧！”这就是大庆工人对一小撮走资派的回答：物质刺激在大庆行不通！
    大庆工人说：“学不学毛主席的书，是大庆红旗更红还是变黑的大问题。”在这个坚定信念的指导下，大庆工人勇敢地捍卫着毛泽东思想的领导权，寸步不让。炼油厂刚投产的时候，工人们把毛主席语录写在厂房里，把语录板挂在机器上。走资派看着害怕，把语录都用白灰盖上了。可是，他们盖上了语录，却压抑不住工人们对毛泽东思想的无限热爱。工人们连夜用一块块两米见方的铁板，正楷写上大字标语，挂在六十多米高的炼焦钢架上，第二天，“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进”十五个大字，迎着东升的太阳放出耀眼的光芒。
    这是大庆工人对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的赤胆忠心！大庆这面红旗，在两条路线斗争的狂涛恶浪中高高飘扬，永放光彩。　
    文化大革命的主力军
    毛主席教导我们：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”正当大庆的一小撮走资派拚命反对工人活学活用毛主席著作，大庆两条路线斗争非常激烈的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命开始了。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底揭开了大庆的阶级斗争盖子，一场空前规模的阶级大较量，在广阔的油田上展开了！
    大庆工人看清了阻碍他们学习毛主席著作的，是一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，愤怒的烈火顿时冲天烧起。霎时间，几百万张革命的大字报，把刘少奇在大庆的代理人冲得人仰马翻。
    一小撮阶级敌人遭到沉重打击，象条受了伤的恶狼作垂死的挣扎。他们使出了恶毒的一招：“人走一半，关井扫线。”
    关井，这两个字象一把重锤打在大庆工人的心弦上！
    关井，就等于切断了社会主义经济的大动脉，让帝国主义、修正主义再来卡我们的脖子！
    关井，是大庆工人的耻辱，在大庆会战的光荣史册上从来没有这样的记载！
      “不能关井！”大庆工人斩钉截铁地说：“抓革命，促生产，是毛主席下的命令，我们坚决执行；井场就是战场，我们寸步不离。”
    他们立即行动起来，炼油工人发出紧急呼吁；钻井和采油工人进行紧急动员……
    有些青年人受了走资派的蒙蔽，脱离了岗位，工人们立即把空额的岗位顶上。钻井老工人梁广斌患肝炎在家里休息，他听说走资派要停产，再也呆不住了，带病赶回井场顶岗。
    就是这样，大庆工人保证了油田一分钟也没有停止出油，有力地支援了我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”大庆工人遵照毛主席的伟大教导，对大叛徒刘少奇及其在大庆的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线展开了深入持久的革命大批判。大批判的烈火燃遍油田。
    一九六六年十二月三十一日，十几万工人和红卫兵小将集合起来，召开了大庆油田会战史上最大的一次会议。揪出了党内一小撮走资派，对资产阶级反动路线进行了深刻的批判。
    在红二联合站工地一排排简陋的临时住房前面，林立着革命大批判的专栏，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命言行，一条条摆在上面示众。下班工人手上的油泥还没有洗，身上的工服还没换，就围在一起，上挂刘少奇，下联走资派，进行革命大批判。油建四大队刚到这个工地，每天从驻地到这里往返要三个多小时。这样，除了坚持生产，剩下的时间就不多了。工人们反复学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，决定搬到这旷野上安家。从此，他们上机搞生产，下机搞批判。施工期间，就在这荒原上，揪出了走资派，开了几百场革命大批判会，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，取得革命、生产双胜利。
    在油建指挥部，有五个远离组织、单独工作的女工，坚持八小时生产，业余搞批判，休假日进行调查研究。
    有一次，运输西站第十三车队冒雨出车执行一项紧急任务。途中尽是田间便道，满路泥浆，汽车一走就陷住了。工人们硬是一步步地推着汽车走，奋战了三天两夜只吃了两顿饭。就是在这样困难的条件下，他们仍然坚持开展革命大批判，在雨地里学习毛主席著作，狠批大叛徒刘少奇的“公私溶化论”。
    英雄的大庆工人就是这样，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，任凭风狂浪大，他们都脚不歪，身不摇，勇往直前。
    充分发挥领导作用
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的大庆工人更加坚信一个真理：紧跟着毛主席就是胜利。
    在文化大革命中，大庆工人天天收听北京传来的伟大领袖毛主席的声音；收听以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令。大庆工人认真地学习毛主席的最新指示，坚决落实毛主席的最新指示。
    今年五月三十一日，大庆革命委员会成立了，浩瀚油海一片欢腾。
    但是，阶级斗争并没有停止，斗争仍在激烈地进行。
    钻井指挥部革委会成立后，有的旧机构还未改革。那里有二十六个科室，三百五十三人，科以上干部就有八十五个。旧机构人员仍然保留着一套旧框框、旧习惯、旧作风。革委会刚建立，有些日常工作还要通过旧机构去办理。这样，尖锐的矛盾就表现出来了：革委会的决议，旧机构总要打个折扣！
    革委会要贯彻毛主席的革命路线，旧机构成了拦路虎！
    旧机构必须改革，可是，阻力很大。
    为什么出现这样大的阻力？
    工人们一针见血地指出：“这是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。斗争的焦点，仍然是政权问题。”
    工人们反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”他们说：“我们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。为了巩固新生的革委会，我们工人要进入机关，领导他们斗、批、改！”
    钻井四大队首先行动起来。一天清晨，他们开着汽车，拉着工人们连夜写出来的数百张大字报来到钻井机关，机关干部还没起床，大字报已经贴满了墙头、屋角、走廊。下午，钻井后勤单位的两百多工人，也打着红旗，浩浩荡荡开进了机关。接着，战斗在野外的井队工人也来到了。机关里，革命大批判的口号声一浪高过一浪，大字报一张接着一张。
    同时，一连几个晚上，革委会都组织了有线广播批判大会，一万多工人、家属、学生一起狠批刘少奇在政权建设和企业管理上的反革命修正主义路线。在这个基础上，工人又和机关的革命干部一起深入地开展了清理阶级队伍的工作，揪出了幕前幕后的一小撮阶级敌人。在工人阶级的领导下，彻底改革了旧机构。现在，这个机构只有三十九人，一半是从群众中选拔的优秀工人，朝气蓬勃，精悍得力。
    钻井指挥部的机构改革，揭开了大庆油田斗、批、改高潮的序幕，一个斗、批、改的革命风暴席卷了整个油田。很快，从大庆革委会至各基层革委会，都进行了机构改革，精简了百分之九十的人员。
    这时，伟大领袖毛主席又英明地指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”大庆工人闻风而动。当时，正是南九联合站施工完毕，准备投产。过去，象这种油、水、电三用的大型现代化工程的投产，少说也得一个半月。
    这一次，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，工人们批判了叛徒刘少奇所推行的“专家治厂”的修正主义办企业路线之后，决定成立工人投产领导小组，由二级泵工王永义和三级油建工田维家总负责，领导这次投产。用毛泽东思想武装起来的大庆工人是无所畏惧的。工人领导小组用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，依靠群众，发挥群众的智慧，发扬革命大协作精神，战胜了各种困难，投产中的绝大部分问题都在现场得到解决。过去，投产中不合理的规章制度多如牛毛，工人开动一个阀门都要向上请示五、六级。现在，这样的规章制度被成套成套地打破了。因此，大大缩短了投产的时间，有些生产管理人员还正在考虑投产计划和准备工作，联合站却已经投产成功了。
    现在，大庆工人按照毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的教导，为实现“无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政”，组织毛泽东思想宣传队进入了油田的一百二十多所学校，以及各科研单位、各医院，担负起领导上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的伟大历史使命。大庆工人在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，正按照工人阶级的面貌改造着一切。
