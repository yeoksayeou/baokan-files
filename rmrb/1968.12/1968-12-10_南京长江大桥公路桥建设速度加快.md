The workers participating in the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge are using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on science and technology. They are vigorously promoting mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities. Advanced technologies and advanced techniques are emerging one after another, and the fruits of technological innovation are abundant, powerfully promoting the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. The workers are displaying the revolutionary pioneering spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. They are breaking down unreasonable rules and regulations, criticizing and changing them while working, and the production progress is rising sharply. In the construction of the highway approach bridge piers, the workers discarded the set of construction methods prescribed by bourgeois technical "authorities" that were labor-intensive, time-consuming, unsafe, and affected the quality of the project, greatly accelerating the construction progress.

    南京长江大桥公路桥建设速度加快
    参加南京长江大桥建设的工人群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义科技路线，大搞群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动。先进技术、先进工艺层出不穷，技术革新硕果累累，有力地促进了南京长江大桥的建设。工人群众发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的革命首创精神，大破不合理的规章制度，边批边改，边改边干，生产进度直线上升。在公路引桥的桥墩施工中，工人们甩掉了资产阶级技术“权威”所规定的那套费工、费时，既不安全，又影响工程质量的施工方法，大大加快了施工进度。
