In vast desert areas, brave armed struggles are unfolding. Guerrillas on the Sinai Peninsula have inflicted heavy blows on Israeli invading forces.

CAIRO, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) — According to recent reports from Cairo newspapers, the oppressed Egyptian people on the east bank of the Suez Canal, which is occupied by Israel, have taken up arms to resist the Israeli invading forces and have achieved great victories.

According to the Egyptian newspaper *Al-Ahram*, shortly after the June 1967 war, the Egyptian people in Sinai organized several assault teams and began armed struggles against the Israeli occupying forces in the vast desert areas of Sinai. The guerrillas have grown stronger in battle, and their struggles have spread from the northern parts of Sinai, such as Romanah and Al-Arish, to the southern parts, including Sharm el-Sheikh and Tor. Israeli "Defense Minister" Dayan recently revealed in a speech that the guerrillas in Sinai have so far carried out more than fifty battles, inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the Israeli invading forces.

According to *Al-Ahram*, after the Israeli invading forces occupied Sinai, they piled a large number of weapons and ammunition in several places on the east bank of the Suez Canal, preparing to transport them away. A group of Sinai youth decided to blow up this batch of ammunition. On the night of July 3, 1967, they infiltrated Shatt, opposite Suez City, and placed timed explosives. A few minutes later, a massive explosion occurred, which lasted for eight hours. Twenty-seven Israeli invaders guarding the ammunition depot were killed, and the Israeli frontline commander who rushed to investigate the accident was also killed by the Sinai youth.

According to reports, after suffering this heavy blow, the Israeli invading forces decided to quickly transport the ammunition piled in other places to Al-Arish, but they were again attacked by the assault teams. On the night of July 6, 1967, the Egyptian assault teams in the northern part of Sinai, Romanah, successfully blew up an Israeli military train loaded with ammunition.

The Sinai assault teams also blew up Israeli ammunition depots in Tor and Sharm el-Sheikh, as well as oil tanks in Abu Zenima, and blew up several Israeli military vehicles in other places in the region.

    在广阔的沙漠地带展开英勇的武装斗争
    西奈半岛游击队痛击以色列侵略军
    新华社开罗二十一日电　据开罗报纸最近报道，在苏伊士运河东岸被以色列占领的西奈半岛上的被压迫的埃及人民纷纷拿起武器，抗击以色列侵略军，并取得巨大的胜利。
    据阿联《金字塔报》报道，一九六七年的六月战争刚刚结束，西奈的埃及人民就组织了几个突击队组织，在西奈广阔的沙漠地带开始进行武装斗争，反对以色列占领军。游击队在战斗中越战越强，他们的斗争已经从西奈北部的罗马纳和阿里什扩及到南部的沙姆沙伊赫和托尔。据以色列“国防部长”达扬最近在一次讲话中透露，西奈的游击队迄今已经进行了五十多次战斗，使以色列侵略军遭到重大伤亡和损失。
    据《金字塔报》报道，以色列侵略军占领西奈以后，把一大批武器和弹药堆放在苏伊士运河东岸的一些地方，准备运走。一批西奈青年决定炸毁这批弹药。他们于一九六七年七月三日夜潜入苏伊士市对面的夏台，安放了有定时装置的炸药。几分钟后，大爆炸发生了，爆炸持续了八个小时。看守弹药库的二十七名以色列侵略军被炸死，匆忙赶来调查事故的以色列前线指挥官也被西奈青年打死。
    据报道，以色列侵略军受到这次沉重打击后，决定把堆集在其他地方的弹药，尽速运往阿里什，但又遭到突击队的袭击。一九六七年七月六日的晚上，西奈的埃及突击队在西奈北部的罗马纳，成功地炸毁了一列满载弹药的以色列军用火车。
    西奈的突击队还炸毁了在托尔和沙姆沙伊赫的以色列弹药库以及在阿布齐尼马的油罐，并在这个地区的其他地方炸毁了一些以色列军车。
