	Angry Accusation

	The old school system promoted the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "intellectual education first" policy, focusing solely on reading and neglecting labor; emphasizing grades over politics. Schools, in their pursuit of "admission rates," forced students to arrive early and return home late, and assigned a mountain of homework to be completed at home. We, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, need to help with household chores and cannot spend all day buried in books. Consequently, we couldn't complete the homework and scored poorly. Some teachers blamed us, saying, "You're stupid and lazy." The school considered me a "stupid" student who would affect their "admission rate," so they expelled me in the fifth grade. What's even more infuriating is that a landlord who infiltrated the teaching staff actually said, "You're not cut out for school. Go home and pick up dog feces instead!" In the old school system, the persecution of children from poor and lower-middle peasant families was not limited to me alone! In our class, twenty-four students were expelled. Who were these so-called "high-achieving" students? The three who were favored at the time were all children of "four categories of elements." It's clear whose interests Liu Shaoqi's "intellectual education first" policy served.

	Now, our commune has established "May Seventh" schools, and we, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants who were expelled, have returned to school. This right to education is given to us by Chairman Mao. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand generations!

    愤怒的控诉
    旧学校推行大叛徒刘少奇“智育第一”的黑货，只讲读书，不讲劳动；只谈分数，不谈政治。学校为了追求“升学率”，就要学生早到校，晚回家，还要学生回家完成一大堆作业。我们贫下中农子弟要帮助家里干活，不能整天钻书本，所以完不成作业，拿不到高分数。有的老师就责备我们“脑子笨，不用心”。学校认为我这个“笨”学生要影响学校的“升学率”，在五年级时就把我淘汰了。更气人的是，一个混进教师队伍的地主分子竟说：“你不是上学的坯子，还是回家拾狗屎吧！”在旧学校，贫下中农子女受迫害的何止我一个！单我们班上，被赶出校门的就有二十四人。所谓“成绩好”的“高材生”是什么人呢？当时被看中的三个，都是四类分子的子女。可见刘少奇的“智育第一”是为谁服务的。
    现在，我们公社办起了“五·七”学校，我们这些被赶出校门的贫下中农子女，又回到学校中来了。这个学习权利是毛主席给我们的。我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
