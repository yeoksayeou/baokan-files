The revolutionary medical staff of Xinxiang Region People's Hospital, through carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, reformed unreasonable medical and health care systems, and established a new type of ward that is warmly welcomed by poor and lower-middle peasants.

The "June 26" ward of Xinxiang Region People's Hospital was established on February 18 this year, with over 150 beds and multiple specialties. The ward has four doctors and twelve nurses, divided into four groups, practicing medical and nursing cooperation and responsible management of patients.

The "June 26" ward prioritizes admitting poor and lower-middle peasants from rural areas, focusing on treating common and frequently occurring diseases. Patients do not need to pay a deposit upon admission; they pay for medication as they take it. Patients can be cared for by family members, bring their own bedding and clothes, and cook their own meals using a stove set up outside the ward. Alternatively, they can rent bedding from the hospital and eat meals provided by the ward, with a daily charge of only 2 jiao per person. In short, everything is done for the convenience of the patients.

Upon admission, the first thing patients do is study Chairman Mao's instructions on medical and health care. Every morning, doctors, nurses, patients, and their family members together ask Chairman Mao for instructions and read his works daily. Every afternoon, between 4 and 5 PM, there is a study session for patients, organized by medical staff or patient group leaders, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and current political events, and carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle.

They also established a system where patients manage the ward, regularly holding meetings with staff and patients to gather opinions, allowing patients to participate in ward management and supervision. Through study, sharing experiences, and discussions, the political atmosphere in the ward is strengthened, deepening the class feelings between medical staff and patients, and promoting the thought revolutionization of individuals. Before the establishment of the "June 26" ward, some bourgeois intellectuals and those with conservative thoughts said that the "June 26" ward would "definitely be dirty and chaotic, and even the white walls would be stained black." However, under the joint management of patients, their families, and medical staff, the ward is kept clean and tidy, providing a powerful education.

Everything is changed for the convenience of poor and lower-middle peasants

Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the "June 26" ward has successfully navigated eight months of intense struggle between the two lines, with many aspects differing significantly from the original ward.

After abolishing the deposit system and other unreasonable old rules, medical costs have been reduced, allowing patients to spend less money and get better treatment. For example, the hospital stay for appendicitis and hernia is significantly shorter in the "June 26" ward, costing around 15 yuan, whereas it would cost around 30 yuan in a "regular" ward. These reforms have greatly facilitated the hospitalization and treatment of poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past eight months, the total number of inpatients was 1,620, of which 939 were peasants, accounting for 58%, compared to only 30.6% in the same period last year. A female peasant from Yuanyang County had a fatty tumor in her abdomen the size of a human head. Due to fear of high medical costs, she suffered for over three years without treatment. This time, she was admitted to the "June 26" ward, underwent surgery in the afternoon of the same day, and was discharged after eight days, spending only 12 yuan. Her husband gratefully said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao caring for the poor and lower-middle peasants, how could we have treated the disease!"

In the past, the medical and nursing system created significant conflicts between doctors and nurses. Now, with medical and nursing cooperation, relationships have improved, and responsibility towards patients has strengthened. Doctors have more practical experience, and nurses can also prescribe medications, benefiting both. This creates favorable conditions for urban medical staff to go to the countryside.

In the past, medical staff managed the ward, and patients, fearing to offend medical staff, had to endure their grievances. Now, the "June 26" ward has established patient groups with worker-peasant patient representatives. In addition to mutual ideological work, ward hygiene, stoves, coal, and water are all managed by lightly ill patients and their families. This changes the relationship between patients, nurses, and doctors, also benefiting the hospital's streamlining and downsizing. Such wards have half the number of medical staff compared to general "regular" wards.

A profound class struggle

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "So-called national health, without the participation of 360 million peasants, is largely empty talk." Therefore, the change in hospitals, like all changes in the superstructure, must stand on the side of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The "June 26" ward is precisely advancing along this path. However, the road is tortuous. As early as 1961, the old party committee of the hospital, for the sake of appearances, also set up a "simple ward." They only assigned a politically unreliable doctor to the ward. Bourgeois "authorities" used it as a place to "unload burdens," sending in some chronic diseases, eventually turning it into a difficult-to-treat liver cirrhosis ward. It collapsed in less than a year.

After the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary masses once again demanded the establishment of a simple ward, but the capitalist roaders used various excuses to reject the masses' opinions. It was not until the establishment of the hospital revolutionary committee that everyone took action to set up this ward.

As Chairman Mao pointed out, class struggle does not change with people's will. After the establishment of the "June 26" ward, it continued to face fierce opposition from class enemies. They said: "Such wards are difficult to manage, chaotic, and not like wards at all. Didn't the previously established simple ward fail?" Some bourgeois intellectuals deliberately sent patients with liver cirrhosis, esophageal cancer, and other diseases to this ward, attempting to change its fundamental direction of primarily serving poor and lower-middle peasants and treating common and frequently occurring diseases. Based on this situation, revolutionary medical staff carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, focusing on the issue of serving the majority or a minority, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Revolutionary criticism and struggle further consolidated and developed the "June 26" ward.

    新乡地区人民医院的革命医护人员，通过开展革命大批判，改革了不合理的医疗卫生制度，建立了一个
    深受贫下中农欢迎的新型病房
        贫下中农欢迎的新型病房
    新乡地区人民医院“六·二六”病房建立于今年二月十八日，共有一百五十多张床位，是多科的综合病房。病房里共有四个医生，十二个护士，医护人员分了四个组，实行医护合作，包干管理病人。
      “六·二六”病房优先收住从农村来的贫下中农，以收治多发病、常见病为主。病人入院不交预交费，什么时候取药，什么时候交钱，取多少药，交多少钱。病人可以由家属照顾，自带被褥衣服，病房外设有火炉，可以自己做饭，也可以租用医院被褥，吃病房的饭，每天每人仅收住院费两角。总之，一切为了病人方便。
    病人入院的第一件事是先学习毛主席的有关医疗卫生的指示；每天早晨，医生、护士、病人及病人家属一起向毛主席请示、天天读。每天下午，四、五点钟之间为病人学习时间，由医护人员或病人组长负责组织病人和家属学习毛主席的最新指示和时事政治，开展革命大批判。
    他们还建立了病人管理病房的制度，定期召开工作人员、病人座谈会，征求病人意见，既让病人参加病房管理，又接受病人监督，通过学习、讲用和座谈，增强了病房的政治空气，加深了医护人员同病人的阶级感情，促进了人的思想革命化。在“六·二六”病房建立之前，某些资产阶级知识分子和有保守思想的人曾说“六·二六”病房“一定又脏又乱，白白的墙壁也会弄黑。”但是在病人、家属和医护人员共同管理之下，病房却保持得清洁、整齐，事实给了他们以有力的教育。
        一切改革都为了贫下中农的方便
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，“六·二六”病房在两条路线的激烈的斗争中胜利地走过了八个月，很多方面都与原病房有显著的不同。
    废除了预交费制度和其他一些不合理的陈规旧章后，降低了医疗费用，使病人能少花钱、治好病。象阑尾炎和疝气，在“六·二六”病房住院时间大大缩短，花钱十五元左右，在“正规”病房要三十元左右。这些改革，都为贫下中农住院治病大开了方便之门。八个月来总住院人数为一千六百二十人，其中农民就有九百三十九人，占百分之五十八，去年同一时期，原来病房住院的农民仅占百分之三十点六。原阳县一贫农女社员，腹部生了个脂肪瘤，大如人头，由于怕花钱多，受了三年多的痛苦没有治疗。这次来院住到“六·二六”病房，上午入院，下午就动了手术，八天痊愈出院，仅花了十二元钱。她的丈夫感激地说：“要不是毛主席关心贫下中农，我们怎能治好病！”
    过去的医护制度，使医和护之间造成很大矛盾。现在，医护合作后，关系改善了，对病人的责任心也加强了。医生接触实际多，护士也可以处方，两者都得到了提高。这样为城市医护人员下农村创造了有利条件。
    过去，医护人员管理病房，病人有意见，但怕得罪医护人员，只好忍气吞声。现在，“六·二六”病房建立了病人小组，选有工农患者代表，除互相作思想工作外，病房内卫生、火炉、煤、水也都是轻病人和病人家属自觉管理。这样，病人、护士、医生的关系改变了，也有利于医院的精兵简政。象这样的病房，医护人员比一般“正规”病房减少一半。
    一场深刻的阶级斗争
    毛主席早就指出：“所谓国民卫生，离开了三亿六千万农民，岂非大半成了空话？”因此，医院的改变，也和一切上层建筑改革一样，立足点必须是广大工农兵。“六·二六”病房正是遵循这一道路前进的。但是道路是曲折的。远在一九六一年，医院旧党委为装潢门面也搞过“简易病房”。他们只给病房配备了一名政治上不可靠的医生。资产阶级“权威”把它当成了“卸包袱”的场所，送上一些慢性病，最后就成了难医疗的肝硬变病房。不到一年便垮台了。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始后，革命群众再一次要求建立简易病房，但是走资派却用种种借口把群众的意见打了回去。一直到医院革委会成立后，大家才亲自动手，把这个病房建立起来。
    正如毛主席所指出的阶级斗争是不以人们的意志为转移的。“六·二六”病房建立以后，继续受到了阶级敌人的疯狂反对。他们说：这样的病房“不好管理，乱的不象病房，以前办的简易病房不是都失败了吗？”某些资产阶级知识分子又故意把一些肝硬变、食道癌等病人往这个病房里送，妄图改变这一病房主要为贫下中农服务，治疗多发病、常见病的根本方向。根据这种情况，革命的医护人员展开了革命的大批判，紧紧围绕为大多数人服务，还是为少数人服务的问题，批判了刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。革命的大批判，使“六·二六”病房得到了进一步的巩固和发展。　本报通讯员
