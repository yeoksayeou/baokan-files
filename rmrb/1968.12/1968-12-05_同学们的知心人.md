At Beijing Electric Power College, students affectionately call Li Guizhen of the Worker Propaganda Team "Li Da Jie" (Older Sister Li). Whenever her name is mentioned, students say, "Li Da Jie is old, but her heart is red."

Li Da Jie arrived at the college not long ago and quickly became the students' confidante. Everyone talks to her about everything. Among the students, stories about Li Guizhen are widely circulated.

After the Cultural Revolution began, due to Liu Shaoqi's mad promotion of the bourgeois reactionary line, students Qi Xiujie and Wei Guizhen became "enemies." Li Da Jie patiently and warmly educated them, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. This eliminated the misunderstandings between them, allowing them to join hands in the struggle to criticize and reform.

Once, while working in a nearby commune, some students felt tired and didn't want to continue. Li Da Jie talked with the students about the fruits of labor. The students thought that Li Da Jie, who was nearly fifty, still worked just like them. Someone suggested she rest, but she refused, saying, "I want to achieve new accomplishments." Since we are young and strong, how can we not persist in labor? Thus, they threw themselves into a new battle.

What moved the students the most was Li Da Jie's class on bitter memories and sweet memories of class education:

Li Da Jie discovered that some students came from poor peasant and worker families. When they first arrived at school, they were content with eating steamed buns and using only half a basin of water to wash their faces, very mindful of saving. Later, they were influenced by the revisionist educational line, detached from workers and peasants, and from labor, gradually changing. One day, during a bitter meal, she called the students to her side and said, "Comrades, you come from poor peasant and worker families, but you don't understand the bitterness of the old society. In the old society, we poor people couldn't even eat this bitter vegetable soup! I remember when I was eight, my father pulled a rickshaw for the capitalists and was beaten by the capitalist's dogs until he was paralyzed and died without money for treatment. My mother pawned our only broken quilt for two dollars to buy a bowl of porridge. Like this, our family didn't know where the next meal would come from. I was forced to become a servant for the capitalists.... This bitter vegetable soup is bitter, but it reminds us to never forget the past. To ensure that our descendants never eat this bitter vegetable soup, we must never forget the past bitterness, always remember today's sweetness, and always follow Chairman Mao in revolution, ensuring that power is forever in the hands of the working class. You were born in the new society and grew up under the red flag, but under the influence of the revisionist educational line, you have been detached from the masses and labor for a long time. Your thoughts and feelings are still far from those of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We sincerely hope that you will receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly change your old thoughts, and become intellectuals welcomed by the proletariat." Li Da Jie's words deeply educated the students. Ma Yunying said, "Why is the working class so loyal to Chairman Mao? It's because they remember the past bitterness and know the sweetness of today."

    同学们的知心人
    在北京电力学院，同学们都把工人宣传队的李桂珍师傅亲切地称为“李大姐”。只要一提起她，同学们都说：“李大姐人老，心红。”
    李大姐到电力学院不久，就成了同学们的知心人，大家对她无话不谈。在同学们中间，也传诵着一件件李桂珍的事情。
    文化大革命开始以后，由于刘少奇疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，使衣秀洁和魏桂芹两位同学成了
  “冤家对头”，李大姐就耐心热情地对她们进行思想教育，和她们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起斗私批修，消除了她们之间的隔阂，使她们并肩投入了斗、批、改的战斗。
    有一次，在附近人民公社劳动，有的同学觉得有些累，不想坚持劳动了。李大姐就和同学们一起谈劳动的收获。同学们想到李大姐快五十岁了，还一直和同学们一样劳动，有人劝她休息一下，她都不肯，说：“我要立新功”，而我们自己年轻力壮，怎么能不坚持劳动呢？于是又投入了新的战斗。
    最使同学们感动的是李大姐给大家上的忆苦思甜的阶级教育课：
    李大姐了解到有部分同学来自贫下中农和工人家庭，刚到学校时，很满足于吃窝窝头，洗脸水也只用半盆，很注意节约。后来，他们受了修正主义教育路线的影响，长期脱离工农，脱离劳动，慢慢变了。有一天，吃忆苦饭，她把同学们叫到身边说：“同学们，你们出身于贫下中农、工人家庭，但你们对旧社会的苦还不了解。在旧社会，咱们穷人就连这苦菜汤也吃不上啊！记得我八岁那年，爸爸给资本家拉洋车，被狗崽子们打成瘫痪，无钱治疗死去了。家里无法生活，妈把全家唯一的一床破被子当了二角钱，才吃了一次粥。就这样，家里吃了上顿还不知下顿在哪里。我被迫给资本家当了佣人。……这苦菜汤是很苦，它却能使我们永远不忘过去。要让子孙万代永远不吃这苦菜汤，就得永远不忘过去的苦，永远记住今日的甜，永远跟着毛主席干革命，使大权永远掌握在工人阶级手里。你们生在新社会，长在红旗下，但是在修正主义教育路线的毒害下，长期脱离群众，脱离劳动，你们的思想感情比起工农兵还有相当的一段距离，我们殷切地希望你们很好地接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，成为无产阶级欢迎的知识分子。”李大姐的话使同学们深受教育。马云英同学说：“工人阶级为什么无限忠于毛主席？就是因为他们牢记过去苦，深知今日甜。”
