Class Struggle Must Be Taught to Every Generation

Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Revolutionary Committee Peng Dechang (Miao)

Liu Shaoqi, this big villain, always goes against our great leader Chairman Mao, peddling the black goods of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." He blathers on about how "the classes have basically been eliminated, so there is no need to emphasize class struggle."

Liu Shaoqi's agent in our autonomous prefecture put it even more bluntly: "In ethnic minority areas, class differentiation is not obvious, and there is no class struggle. Especially among the Miao people, they all live in high mountains and deep valleys, making a living by cutting down mountains, with no land, so class differentiation is even less obvious, and there is no class struggle." The master and the slave sing in harmony, both telling blatant lies!

Does class struggle not exist? Do ethnic minority regions have no class distinctions and class struggle? No! There is class struggle!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of civilization over several thousand years. To explain history from this viewpoint is historical materialism; to stand on the opposite side of this viewpoint is historical idealism."

Before liberation, I worked as a laborer for a reactionary Miao king in the Wuzhishan area. This reactionary Miao king had dozens of acres of paddy fields. His grandfather was a regional magistrate who, relying on the KMT reactionaries, ruthlessly exploited and oppressed the people. His father was a bishop of the Christian church who, in collusion with American imperialist missionaries, forced the people to pay money and grain, carry bricks to build churches, and used "worship services" to exploit the Miao people. His father even proclaimed himself the "reincarnated Emperor Pangu," claiming that "Emperor Pangu established the heavens and earth," and that tens of thousands of acres of land in the area should be under his jurisdiction, requiring the Miao people to "worship" and "tribute" to him. Later, his father colluded with the KMT warlords on Hainan Island to become a fake clan chief, brutally suppressing the Miao people's revolution. In 1944, four miners, unable to bear the brutal oppression of the Japanese devils, escaped to the mountains. Upon hearing the news, he led a group of people to kill the four miners alive, personally killing one of them.

When I worked as a laborer in this reactionary Miao king's family, I suffered all kinds of humiliation and exploitation. I worked like a cow and horse for his family all year round, but in the end, I had nothing. I ate pig and dog food and wore tree bark and sackcloth.

Is this not evidence that the Miao region has no class differentiation and no class struggle?! It is all a pack of lies!

After liberation, this reactionary Miao king, whose hands were stained with the blood of the Miao people of Wuzhishan, should have been punished by the people. However, under the protection of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" by the number one capitalist-roader and traitor Liu Shaoqi, Liu Shaoqi's agent in the autonomous prefecture actually brought this reactionary scoundrel into the proletarian government apparatus.

After this reactionary scoundrel infiltrated the proletarian government apparatus, he engaged in frenzied anti-party, anti-people, and anti-socialist criminal activities. He established an independent kingdom, opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, and wanted the liberated Miao people of Wuzhishan to suffer his rule again. He was a complete scoundrel and extremely reactionary!

During the rebellion of a small group of reactionary upper-class figures in Tibet, this reactionary Miao king incited the Miao people to be dissatisfied with the Party and incited them to go to the mountains to engage in individual farming, disrupting the collective economy.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we thoroughly criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," raised our class struggle awareness, and finally exposed this scoundrel.

The above facts fully prove that ethnic minority regions not only had classes and class struggle before liberation but also had classes and class struggle after liberation. This class struggle is long-term, complex, and sometimes very intense.

The great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices denied the classes and class struggle in the transitional period and vigorously promoted the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." They wanted to use this counter-revolutionary theory as a cover to carry out their criminal activities of usurping the Party, usurping political power, and usurping the military, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, and making our people of all nationalities suffer oppression from the three great enemies again.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly and repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." Since there are classes and class struggle, we must talk about class struggle, talk about it every day, every month, every year, and every generation. We must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines, constantly raise our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and use Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and thoroughly eliminate his poisonous influence.

    阶级斗争要代代讲
    海南黎族苗族自治州革命委员会　盆德昌（苗族）
    刘少奇这个大坏蛋到处与我们伟大领袖毛主席唱反调，到处贩卖“阶级斗争熄灭论”的黑货。他胡说什么：“阶级已基本消灭了，就不应该强调阶级斗争。”
    刘少奇在我们自治州的代理人，说得更露骨：“民族地区阶级分化不明显，没有阶级斗争。特别是苗族，都是住在高山峻岭上，靠砍山过活，没有土地，阶级分化更不明显，不存在什么阶级斗争。”黑主子与奴仆一唱一和，都是睁着眼睛说瞎话！
    阶级斗争不存在了吗？少数民族地区没有阶级区分和阶级斗争吗？不！有阶级斗争！
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。”
    解放前，我给五指山区一个反动苗王当长工。这个反动苗王家里有几十亩水田。祖父是一个地区的总管，依仗国民党反动派，对人民进行残酷的剥削和压迫。他的父亲是基督教的一个主教，曾经勾结美帝国主义的传教士，强制人民缴钱缴粮，挑砖建教堂，还利用做“礼拜”，对苗民进行剥削。他父亲曾自己封为再生的“盘古皇帝”，胡说什么“盘古皇定天地”，当地几万亩土地都要划归他管辖，要苗民对他“朝拜”、“进贡”。以后，他父亲又与海南岛国民党军阀狼狈为奸，当上伪团董，残酷镇压苗族人民革命。一九四四年，有四个矿工由于在铁矿受不了日本鬼子的残酷迫害，逃跑到山上。他闻讯后，就带一帮人将四名矿工活活杀死，还亲手杀死了一个。
    我在这个反动苗王家里当长工的时候，受尽百般欺凌和剥削，整年整月为他家当牛做马，到头来什么也没有，吃的是猪狗饭，披的是树皮麻袋。
    这难道是苗族地区阶级分化不明显，不存在什么阶级斗争吗？！完全是一派骗人的鬼话！
    解放后，这个双手沾满了五指山区苗族人民鲜血、罪恶累累的反动苗王，本该受到人民应有的惩罚。可是，在党内头号走资派、大叛徒刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”的保护下，刘少奇在自治州的代理人竟把这个反动家伙拉进无产阶级政权机构。
    这个反动家伙混进无产阶级政权机构后，疯狂地进行反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动。他大搞独立王国，反对共产党的领导，要解放了的五指山区苗族人民重新遭受他的统治。真是混蛋透顶，反动至极！
    在西藏一小撮反动上层人物叛乱的时候，这个反动苗王到处煽动苗胞对党不满，煽动苗胞上山搞单干，破坏集体经济。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们狠批了“阶级斗争熄灭论”，提高了阶级斗争的觉悟，终于把这个家伙揪了出来。
    以上事实充分说明，少数民族地区不但解放前存在着阶级和阶级斗争，而且解放后也存在着阶级和阶级斗争，这种阶级斗争是长期的、复杂的、有时甚至是很激烈的。
    大叛徒刘少奇及其同伙否认过渡时期的阶级和阶级斗争，竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，就是要在这种反革命理论的掩护下，进行篡党、篡政、篡军的罪恶活动，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，使我们各族人民重受三大敌人的压迫。
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”既然存在着阶级，有阶级斗争，我们就要讲阶级斗争，要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，代代讲。我们一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，用毛主席无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说彻底批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，彻底肃清他的流毒。
