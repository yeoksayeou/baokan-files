Workers, Peasants, and Students in Tokyo and Fukuoka Hold Angry Anti-U.S. Demonstrations

BEIJING, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Dongfang News Agency, workers, peasants, and students in Tokyo and Fukuoka and other places in Japan held rallies and demonstrations on Dec. 1, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. imperialist military bases from Japan.

About 700 workers and students from Fukuoka Prefecture and neighboring prefectures participated in a rally and march on Dec. 1. They carried red flags with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" written in large characters. Workers and student representatives spoke at the rally. They pointed out that the reactionary Sato government, frightened by the fighting spirit of the Japanese people, is trying to extinguish the flames of struggle. However, our struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to achieve Japanese independence is just. As long as we rely on the people and persist in the struggle, final victory will surely be ours.

After the rally, the participants, despite the suppression by reactionary police, marched towards the Itazuke U.S. military base. They joined forces with some worker contingents that had gathered there and stormed into the construction site where the U.S. military was preparing to expand the base. They raised their fists and shouted, "U.S. imperialism, get out of Japan and Asia!" "Down with the Sato government!" "Smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'!"

About 2,000 workers from Tokyo and the Kanto region, along with farmers from Sunagawa Town, held a rally in the afternoon in a square near the Tachikawa U.S. Air Force Base. The Sunagawa Town farmers hung red flags on both sides of the podium, with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" written on them.

Leaders of the Sunagawa Town farmers, representatives from farmers in Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, and Tsu City, Osaka Prefecture, as well as worker representatives from various places, all spoke at the rally. They unanimously expressed their determination to unite closely and strengthen the struggle to withdraw U.S. military bases and abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The rally unanimously passed a resolution strongly condemning U.S. aggression in Asia.

The participants also angrily condemned a revisionist who had climbed onto the podium to speak. They shouted, "Traitor, get out immediately!" "We will not allow the betrayal of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists!"

After the rally, the participants, with many red flags leading the way, marched through Tachikawa City in a demonstration, despite the obstruction by fascist police.

    日东京、福冈人民愤怒举行反美示威
    新华社二日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本东京和福冈等地的工人、农民和学生一日分别举行集会和示威游行，要求撤除美帝国主义在日本的军事基地。
    福冈县和其他附近各县的大约七百名工人和学生在一日的集会和游行中，高举写着“毛泽东思想万岁”大字的红旗。工人和学生代表在集会上发表讲话。他们指出，佐藤反动政府被日本人民的斗争怒火吓破了胆，妄图扑灭斗争的烈火。但是，我们要求废除日美“安全条约”和争取日本独立的斗争，是正义的。只要我们依靠人民，坚持斗争，最后胜利一定是属于我们的。
    会后，与会者不顾反动警察的镇压，向板付美军基地前进，同预先聚集在那里的一些工人队伍汇合在一起，冲进了美军准备扩建基地的工地。他们振臂高呼：“美帝从日本和亚洲滚出去！”“打倒佐藤政府！”“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”
    东京和关东地区的约两千名工人，一日下午同砂川镇农民一起在立川美国空军基地附近的一个广场上举行了集会。砂川镇农民在会场主席台两旁的旗竿上悬挂起红旗，上面写着：“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    砂川镇农民的领导人青木市五郎、千叶县三里塚和茨木县的农民代表，以及来自各地的工人代表都在会上讲了话。他们一致表示决心紧密团结，加强斗争，争取撤除美军基地和废除日美“安全条约”。
    集会一致通过一项强烈谴责美帝侵略亚洲的决议。
    参加集会的群众还愤怒地谴责了一个挤到主席台上讲话的修正主义分子，他们高呼：“叛徒，立即滚回去！”“我们决不容许日共修正主义者的叛卖阴谋！”
    会后，与会者以许多面红旗为前导，不顾法西斯警察的阻挠，在立川市举行了示威游行。
