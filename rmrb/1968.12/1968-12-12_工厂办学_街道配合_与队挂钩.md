After reading the revolutionary initiative proposed by comrades Hóu Zhènmín and Wáng Qìngyú, and considering the situation in our school and other schools, I believe that in urban areas, a factory should take responsibility for a middle school, with the local neighborhood committee providing assistance and the school being linked with a production brigade. This approach will better implement Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive."

1. Factories running schools directly realize the leadership of the working class over schools, thoroughly smashing the independent kingdom of the bourgeois intellectuals, ensuring that schools become bastions for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and furnaces for tempering revolutionary successors. The reduction in labor force due to factory workers being assigned to run schools can be compensated by revolutionary teachers and students entering the factory for re-education, which is also beneficial for factory production.

2. Students are mostly children of local residents, and their daily education and job assignments after graduation often require the neighborhood committee's involvement. If the neighborhood committee assists the factory in running the school, it will not only facilitate the above work but also organically combine school education with community education. Moreover, students, under the arrangement of the neighborhood committee, will have opportunities to engage in mass work at any time. This is a force that the neighborhood committee cannot ignore in its work.

3. Urban middle schools generally have over a thousand students, which a single factory may find difficult to accommodate. If the school is also linked with a production brigade in the suburbs, then every student will have the assurance of learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs. At the same time, this non-emergency support for agriculture is also very beneficial for the brigade's overall production arrangements.

    工厂办学  街道配合  与队挂钩
    看了侯振民、王庆余两同志的革命倡议，结合我校和兄弟学校情况，我认为城市中学由一个工厂负责，所在街道配合，同时与一个生产大队挂钩，才能更好地贯彻毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示。
    一、工厂办校，直接实现了工人阶级对学校的领导，能够彻底砸烂资产阶级知识分子的独立王国，保证学校成为宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，成为锻炼革命接班人的熔炉。工厂因办校抽去工人减少的劳动力，完全可由进厂接受再教育的革命师生补足，对工厂生产也是有利的。
    二、学生基本上都是学校附近街道居民的子弟，平时教育、毕业分配都经常需要街道作工作。如果街道配合工厂办学校，不但对上述工作有利，而且还能把校内校外教育有机地结合起来。并且，学生在街道的安排下，随时都有作群众工作的机会。这对街道开展工作也是一支不可忽视的力量。
    三、城市中学一般都有上千学生，如果只一个工厂，很难容纳；如果再固定与郊区一个大队挂钩，那么每个学生学工、学农、学军，就都有了保证。同时，这种非突击性的支农，对大队全面安排生产也极为有利。驻天津市七十五中学工人毛泽东思想宣传队　李连科
