During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our great leader Chairman Mao proposed the principle of the Communist Party's independent leadership within the anti-Japanese national united front. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi vigorously advocated a surrenderist "united front," claiming that the Kuomintang was "the most common, legal form of the anti-Japanese united front, the best ready-made form," and advocating that the Communist Party be unified under the Kuomintang. This is a thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary "unity theory." It is even more blatant and thorough than the right-opportunist Wang Ming's surrenderist line of "everything through the united front, everything subordinated to the united front." In fact, such a surrenderist "united front" played a role within our party that Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist, anti-people policies could not achieve.

At that time, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: The "united front" in the War of Resistance Against Japan is a united front of all revolutionary classes and factions led by the Party. "Unity in resistance, unity in solidarity, unity in progress" is the political basis of our Party's "united front." In the united front, whether or not the Communist Party should lead, and whether or not to adhere to the Party's independent leadership within the united front, this not only relates to the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but also relates to whether, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we will take the revolutionary road of the Communist Party or the counter-revolutionary road of the Kuomintang. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary "unity theory" completely negates the leadership of the Communist Party, negates the principles of resistance, solidarity, and progress, and talks nonsense about "common" and "legal." Such "unity" is to eliminate the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the anti-Japanese democratic base areas led by the Communist Party, to "unify" under the Kuomintang, and to serve Chiang Kai-shek and Japanese imperialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao once sharply denounced the traitor Liu Shaoqi's shameless lies: "When the Kuomintang's anti-communist diehards resolutely implement their policies of preventing, limiting, and opposing communism, and use this as preparation for surrendering to Japan, we should emphasize struggle, not unity, otherwise it would be a great mistake."

The policy of the united front formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao is a policy of both unity and struggle, to develop progressive forces, win over intermediate forces, and strike at diehard forces. While Liu Shaoqi advocates "unity theory," he only wants unity and not struggle, attempting to "unify" the Communist Party under the Kuomintang's banner of "one-party dictatorship" to achieve his treacherous goal of serving Chiang Kai-shek.

Whether or not to struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries is essentially a question of whether or not to make a revolution and whether or not to be a slave of the country. Soon after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the traitor Wang Jingwei, who sold out the country, surrendered to Japanese imperialism, and the big landlords and compradors led by Chiang Kai-shek became increasingly passive in resisting Japan and active in opposing communism, preparing to surrender to Japanese imperialism. When Chiang Kai-shek launched an anti-communist wave, the Japanese invaders, Chiang, and Wang formed a tripartite alliance, directing their spears at the liberated areas. Faced with this serious situation, Liu Shaoqi advocated unification under the "banner" of the Kuomintang, which exposed his counter-revolutionary face as a running dog of Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek.

Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary "unity theory" is the Kuomintang reactionaries' "unity theory." After the victory of the War of Resistance, he still wanted to sell out the people's armed forces and the people's political power, attempting to "unify" the Communist Party with the Kuomintang reactionaries! After the liberation of the whole country, he still wanted to "unify" with the bourgeoisie, ordering workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to welcome the exploitation of capitalists and rich peasants.

A large number of facts prove that the great traitor, great spy, and great labor traitor Liu Shaoqi's "unity theory" is a thoroughgoing theory of surrender.

Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of counter-revolutionary surrenderism is truly heinous! We resolutely overthrow Liu Shaoqi!

    刘少奇的“统一论”是投降论
    解放军某部五好战士　谢顺章
    抗日战争时期，我们伟大领袖毛主席提出了共产党在抗日民族统一战线中的独立自主的原则。但是，大叛徒刘少奇却大肆宣扬投降主义的
  “统一战线”，胡说国民党是
  “抗日统一战线最通俗的、合法的组织形式，最好的现成的形式”，鼓吹把共产党统一到国民党那里去。这是地地道道的反革命的“统一论”，这比右倾机会主义分子王明“一切经过统一战线，一切服从统一战线”的投降主义路线更加露骨，更加彻底。实际上，这样的投降主义的“统一战线”在我们党内起到了蒋介石反共反人民的政策所起不到的作用。
    当时，我们伟大领袖毛主席就指出：抗日战争中的“统一战线”是党领导的各革命阶级、各革命派别的统一战线。“统一于抗战，统一于团结，统一于进步”，就是我党
  “统一战线”的政治基础。在统一战线中，要不要共产党领导，坚持不坚持党在统一战线中独立自主的原则，这不仅关系到抗日战争的胜败问题，同时也关系到抗战胜利后是走共产党的革命道路，还是走国民党反革命道路的问题。大叛徒刘少奇的反革命的“统一论”，一笔勾销了共产党的领导，勾销了抗日、团结、进步这样原则性的问题，而侈谈什么“通俗”、“合法”，这样的“统一”，就是要消灭共产党所领导的八路军、新四军和抗日民主根据地，“统一”于国民党，为他投降蒋介石、日本帝国主义服务。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经一针见血地痛斥了叛徒刘少奇的无耻谰言：“在国民党反共顽固派坚决地执行其防共、限共、反共政策，并以此为投降日本的准备的时候，我们应强调斗争，不应强调统一，否则就会是绝大的错误。”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席制定的统一战线的方针，是又联合又斗争的方针，要发展进步势力、争取中间势力、打击顽固势力。而刘少奇所鼓吹的“统一论”，就是只要统一，不要斗争，妄图把共产党“统一”在国民党“一党专政”的黑旗之下，达到他效忠蒋介石的罪恶目的。
    要不要与国民党反动派作斗争，这实质上是要不要革命，当不当亡国奴的大问题。抗战爆发之后不久，以卖国贼汪精卫为首的亲日派就投降了日本帝国主义，以蒋介石为首的大地主、大买办阶级越来越消极抗日，积极反共，准备投降日本帝国主义。在蒋介石发起反共高潮的时候，日本侵略者和蒋、汪三位一体，把矛头指向了解放区。面对这一严重局面，刘少奇却鼓吹在国民党的“旗帜”之下统一起来，这正暴露了他充当日本帝国主义、蒋介石走狗的反革命面貌。
    刘少奇的反革命“统一论”，就是国民党反动派的“统一论”。抗日战争胜利以后，他还想出卖人民武装、人民政权，妄图把共产党“统一”于国民党反动派！全国解放后，他还想和资产阶级搞
  “统一”，命令工人、贫下中农去欢迎资本家、富农剥削。
    大量事实证明，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的“统一论”是彻头彻尾的投降论。
    刘少奇宣扬反革命的投降论真是罪恶滔天！我们坚决打倒刘少奇！
