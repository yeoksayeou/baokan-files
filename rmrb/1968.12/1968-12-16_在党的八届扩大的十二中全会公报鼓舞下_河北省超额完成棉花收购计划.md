Inspired by the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, Hebei Province has, by December 5, exceeded this year's cotton procurement plan. The total amount of cotton procured is more than 20 percent higher than last year.

Hebei Province is a major cotton-producing area in northern China. This year, the cotton-producing areas in the province faced severe drought and pest infestations. Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "ensure grain production, ensure cotton production, and ensure cloth production," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres launched a fierce struggle against natural disasters. They criticized the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hebei who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" in the countryside, attempting to dismantle the socialist collective economy. Taking Dazhai as an example, they fought tenaciously against natural disasters, achieving the goal of "no rain in spring, ensure sowing; little rain in a year, ensure a bumper harvest." This year, the cotton sowing area is basically the same as last year, but the total cotton production has increased by more than 10 percent compared to last year.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with a deep proletarian sentiment of "not forgetting the Communist Party in times of bounty" and "not forgetting Chairman Mao in times of bounty," launched a wave of enthusiastically selling new cotton to the state as soon as it was harvested. After the publication of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with the communiqué as their driving force, intensified class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and launched a new wave of selling cotton to the state. Recently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "thrift for revolution," have launched a mass movement of meticulous harvesting and careful picking. The peasants of Zhengding County, which has achieved the goal of 100 jin of lint cotton per mu, have, after completing the state's cotton procurement task in excess, sold part of the meticulously harvested and carefully picked cotton to the state.

    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下
    河北省超额完成棉花收购计划
    广大贫下中农和革命干部，遵照毛主席“必须把棉花抓紧”的指示，战胜了严重干旱和虫害，获得棉花大丰收。他们怀着丰收不忘共产党，丰收不忘毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，踊跃把新棉交售给国家
    新华社石家庄十五日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，河北省到十二月五日已超额完成今年棉花收购计划。棉花收购总量比去年增长百分之二十以上。
    河北省是我国北方的主要产棉区。今年，全省棉产区遇到了严重的干旱和虫害。广大贫下中农和革命干部在伟大领袖毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的号召指引下，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在河北的代理人在农村推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义路线，妄图瓦解社会主义集体经济的滔天罪行，以大寨人为榜样，向自然灾害展开了英勇顽强的斗争，做到了他们提出的“一春无雨保播种，一年少雨保丰收”。今年棉花播种面积和去年基本相等，但棉花总产量比去年增产一成以上。
    获得棉花丰收的广大贫下中农，怀着丰收不忘共产党，丰收不忘毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，在新棉一开摘就掀起了踊跃向国家交售棉花的热潮。党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，广大贫下中农以公报为动力，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，深入开展革命大批判，再次掀起了交售棉花的新高潮。最近，广大贫下中农遵照伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，开展了群众性的精收细摘活动。已经实现百斤皮棉县的正定县社员，在超额完成国家棉花交售任务后，又把精收细摘的一部分棉花交售给国家。
