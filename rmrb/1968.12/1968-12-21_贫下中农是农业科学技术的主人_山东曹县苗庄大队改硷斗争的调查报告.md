The poor and lower-middle peasants of Miaozhuang Brigade, Ancaizhou Commune, Cao County, Shandong Province, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi. They broke away from superstition, liberated their minds, and with a revolutionary spirit to fight against nature, created advanced experiences in planting grain and cotton on saline-alkali land by digging ditches and improving the soil. They have achieved high yields year after year.

A Dramatic Transformation

Miaozhuang Brigade is located on the northern bank of the old course of the Yellow River, with low-lying terrain. More than 90% of the brigade's 600-plus mu of land is severely saline-alkali. In the old society, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants suffered cruel exploitation by the landlord class and the torment of natural disasters, living a miserable life worse than cattle and horses.

After liberation, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Miaozhuang Brigade, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, stood up politically and had their lives guaranteed. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, they fought against nature, fought against the land, and fought against class enemies, achieving tremendous results. Miaozhuang Brigade underwent a dramatic transformation.

In the past, when the wind blew, the sky was white and vast; walking on the ground made a rustling sound; planting a gourd yielded only two ladles. Now, the roads are straight, the fields are square, and the summer wheat fields are golden waves. In autumn, the cotton fields are silver-clad, and cattle and sheep are plump and strong. Every household has savings, every brigade has reserves, and machines roar. In the past three years, on average, each person has contributed 120 jin of cotton to the state annually.

Among all the changes, the most fundamental is the change in people's thinking. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are deeply loyal to Chairman Mao. They regard "unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao" as the highest principle guiding their actions. Every household of poor and lower-middle peasants has Mao Zedong's quotations pasted all over the walls, and every household has a portrait of Chairman Mao; they never part from Chairman Mao's books, their hearts never leave Mao Zedong Thought, and their actions never leave Chairman Mao's instructions. The 70-year-old poor peasant, Grandma Gao, with thousands of stitches, embroidered "Long live Chairman Mao" in golden letters on her headscarf and wore it to propagate Mao Zedong Thought on stage.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have greatly heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They harbor deep hatred for the great traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi and his local agents, conducting a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, seriously purging the class ranks, and determined to advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

A Fierce Struggle

The process of improving saline-alkali soil and conducting scientific experiments by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Miaozhuang Brigade is also a process of fierce struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines.

Since liberation, they have persistently fought to improve the soil. After countless experiments, by 1962, the results were not significant. At this time, some technicians from the province came here, measuring the soil layers up to tens of meters deep, and upon seeing that they were all saline-alkali soil, they arbitrarily declared: "Only saltwort can be grown here, no other crops can be planted," sentencing the land in this area to death. Many people lost confidence in improving the soil. Some advocated moving to the Northeast or Shanxi to leave the saline-alkali area. A walking capitalist-roadier in the county openly jumped out, saying: "If you want to improve the saline-alkali soil, you might as well divide the land to individual households," attempting to sabotage the socialist collective economy. Just at this most difficult time, the brigade party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "When poor, think of change, be active, and make a revolution." "Our comrades, when facing difficulties, should see achievements, see light, and raise our spirits." The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings shone like a red sun, illuminating the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They made up their minds to overcome difficulties and strive hard. Summarizing the lessons from past failures, they realized: Among countless lessons, the greatest lesson is not learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought well. If political and ideological leadership is not in place, there are thoughts of fearing hardship, fearing fatigue, and fearing trouble, it is impossible to achieve victory in the struggle to improve the soil.

Thus, the party branch led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using the "Three Articles" as a motto, learning the heroic deeds of the Dazhai people, and learning the revolutionary spirit of Comrade Jiaozhu Lu. This further promoted the ideological revolutionization of the people. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants established the spirit of farming for the revolution, enhancing their revolutionary confidence to fight against nature and thoroughly improve the saline-alkali soil.

The soil here contains four major harmful substances: salt, alkali, saltpeter, and saltpeter. To master the laws of these four harmful substances, in scientific experiments, brigade leader Zhao Jinju, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and taste it yourself," tasted the soil of various qualities in the entire brigade, summarizing the characteristics and laws of salty, cool saltpeter, bitter brine, and pungent alkali, and the laws of salt coming out in heat, saltpeter coming out in cold, and alkali coming out in neither cold nor heat. He derived the scientific theory that planting cotton by digging ditches in saline-alkali soil can achieve high yields. The 70-year-old old peasant, Grandpa Yao Hanchi, in his three mu experimental field, dug ditches and sowed seeds, achieving a high yield of 195 jin of cotton per mu.

The victory of Miaozhuang Brigade in improving the soil angered a handful of capitalist-roaders and reactionary academic "authorities." They were terrified and hated the achievements of the poor and lower-middle peasants in agricultural science, trying every means to suppress and belittle them. One day, an "expert" from the province came and debated with Zhao Jinju for four hours, denying their experience, saying that digging ditches and planting cotton was "treating the symptoms but not the root cause." Zhao Jinju and the poor and lower-middle peasants strongly replied: "For such severely saline-alkali soil, we can guarantee full and vigorous seedlings every year and a bumper harvest. How do you define treating the root cause?" This left the "expert" speechless and unable to respond. To solve the problem of reasonable planting density in saline-alkali cotton fields, they also created a method of leaving two seedlings per plant. Later, another foreign "expert" came and saw their method of leaving two seedlings per plant, saying that "there is a contradiction between individual and group development." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Miaozhuang did not listen to any of that, conducting scientific experiments according to their own path, increasing the yield per unit area by 30%.

Although the scientific experience of Miaozhuang Brigade in improving the soil was repeatedly challenged and slandered by capitalist-roaders and reactionary academic "authorities," the broad revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasants, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, finally achieved success. In 1966, Comrade Zhang Qingli, a comrade-in-arms of Comrade Jiaozhu Lu, led the cadres above the brigade level in Lankao County to visit Miaozhuang. The deep affection of the people of Lankao gave great encouragement to the people of Miaozhuang. In the past three years, Miaozhuang Brigade has sent 59 technical personnel to help the poor and lower-middle peasants in various places improve the soil. Their experience has been widely spread.

The Lowly are the Wisest

The victory of Miaozhuang Brigade in improving the soil demonstrated the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, once again proving the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's teaching that "the lowly are the wisest, and the noble are the most foolish."

Chairman Mao taught us: "The wisest and most talented are those with the most practical experience." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Miaozhuang Brigade not only broke through the technical difficulties of high-yield cotton planting on saline-alkali soil, solving problems that agricultural "experts" could not solve, but also, from the practice of improving the soil, cultivated a team of technical personnel for improving the soil and planting cotton. This team was born and raised in the soil, not seeking fame or personal gain, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, and mastered a set of very solid skills. In 1966, Miaozhuang Brigade accepted the invitation of the people of Lankao, sending a few villagers to help improve the soil and plant cotton. They studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the local poor and lower-middle peasants, using the methods they summarized from practical struggles, achieving a yield of 137 jin of cotton per mu on 32 mu of saline-alkali soil. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The local methods are the best."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Miaozhuang turned the production brigade into a large school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, a test field for seizing the scientific and technological front, and a large school for cultivating agricultural scientific and technological personnel. Since improving the soil and planting cotton, Miaozhuang Brigade has had many agricultural experts and technical personnel come and go. Some put on a show of being knowledgeable and incompatible with the poor and lower-middle peasants, making fools of themselves; some humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, walking the path of uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and were welcomed. Four years ago, a young technician came. Due to the poisoning of the bourgeois educational line, he only wanted to achieve something personally, staying in the house doing experiments even on hot days, burning 30-plus jin of alcohol, taking more than 1,000 jin of saline-alkali soil, and still achieving nothing. The poor and lower-middle peasants kindly told him: "You won't achieve anything by burning alcohol; walk a few more years on the ridges and roll a few times in the mud, and you'll learn everything." From then on, he went out of the laboratory and learned and lived with the poor and lower-middle peasants, gradually establishing deep class feelings. The poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and their noble qualities of diligence and hard work deeply educated him. Now he not only masters the theory and technology of improving saline-alkali soil but also, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, has cultivated three excellent cotton varieties. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "Such technicians are our own people, and we welcome them."

    贫下中农是农业科学技术的主人
    ——山东曹县苗庄大队改硷斗争的调查报告
    山东省曹县安才楼公社苗庄大队的贫下中农，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义科技路线，破除迷信，解放思想，以战天斗地的革命精神，创造了在盐硷土地上开沟改硷种植粮棉的先进经验，连年夺得了高额产量。
    翻天覆地的变化
    苗庄大队位于黄河故道北岸，地势低洼，全大队六百多亩土地百分之九十以上是重硷地。在万恶的旧社会，广大贫下中农受尽了地主阶级的残酷剥削和自然灾害的折磨，过着牛马不如的悲惨生活。
    解放后，苗庄大队的贫下中农，在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下，政治上翻了身，生活上有了保障。在毛主席关于“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验”三大革命运动的光辉思想指引下，与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，取得了巨大的成绩，苗庄大队发生了翻天覆地的变化。
    过去，这里是风起满天白茫茫，走在地上唰唰响；种一葫芦收两瓢，盐硷地里饿瘦羊。现在是路正渠直地成方，夏天麦海翻金浪，秋后棉田披银装，牛羊成群肥又壮。户户有存款，队队有积累，机器隆隆响。近三年来，平均每人每年向国家贡献皮棉一百二十斤。
    千变化，万变化，人的思想变化是最根本的变化。广大贫下中农对毛主席无限忠诚，他们把“无限忠于毛主席”当成指导自己行动的最高准则。贫下中农家家毛主席语录贴满墙，户户都有毛主席像；他们身不离毛主席的书，心不离毛泽东思想，行动不离毛主席的指示。七十多岁的贫农高大娘千针万线绣忠心，在头巾上绣上“毛主席万岁”五个金光闪闪的大字，顶在头上登台宣传毛泽东思想。
    广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高。他们对大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其在本地的代理人怀着刻骨仇恨，深入持久地开展革命大批判，认真清理阶级队伍，决心沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。
    一场激烈的斗争
    苗庄大队贫下中农改造盐硷地、进行科学实验的过程，也是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的过程。
    解放以来，他们一直坚持改硷斗争。经过无数次试验，直到一九六二年，收效不大。这时，从省里来了一些技术人员，在这里测遍了十几米深的土层，一看都是硷土，便武断地说：“这里只能种硷蓬棵，不能种任何庄稼”，判了这一带土地的死刑。不少人对改硷失去信心。有的主张上东北下山西离开硷窝。县里一个走资派公开跳出来说：“要想改硷地，除非分田到户”，妄图破坏社会主义集体经济。就在这最困难的时候，大队党支部组织大家学习毛主席语录：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”伟大领袖毛主席的教导，象一轮红日照亮了贫下中农的心，他们下定了克服困难、艰苦奋斗的决心，总结了以往失败的教训，体会到：千教训，万教训，没有学好用好毛泽东思想是最大的教训。政治思想不挂帅，存在着怕苦、怕累、怕麻烦的思想，就不可能取得改硷斗争的胜利。
    于是党支部领导广大贫下中农开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，学习大寨人的英雄事迹，学习焦裕禄同志的革命精神，进一步促进了人们的思想革命化，广大贫下中农树立了为革命种田的精神，增强了战天斗地、彻底改造盐硷地的革命信心。
    这里的土壤中，含有盐硷卤硝四大害，严重影响作物的生长。为了掌握四大害的规律，在科学实验中，生产队长赵金聚同志遵照毛主席“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃”的教导，尝了全大队各种土质的味道，总结出咸盐、凉硝、苦卤、辣臭硷和热出盐、冷出硝、不冷不热出硷的特性和规律，得出了硷地开沟植棉能够丰产的科学理论。七十岁的姚汉池老大爷在管理的三亩试验田里开沟播种进行了实践，结果创造了亩产皮棉一百九十五斤的高额产量。
    苗庄大队改硷斗争的胜利，触怒了一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”。他们对贫下中农在农业科学中取得的成就怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计地进行扼杀和贬低。有一天，省里来了一个“专家”，和赵金聚辩论了四个小时，否定他们的经验，说什么开沟植棉是“治标不治本”。赵金聚和贫下中农有力地回答说：“象这样的重硷地，我们能够保证年年苗全苗旺，年年丰收。请问怎么才算是治本呢？”问得这位“专家”张口结舌，无言可答。为了解决硷地植棉合理密植问题，他们还创造了双株留苗的方法，后来，又来了一个洋“专家”，看到他们双株留苗，说什么“个体和群体发育有矛盾”。苗庄的贫下中农根本不听那一套，按照自己的道路进行科学实验，使单位面积产量提高了百分之三十。
    苗庄大队贫下中农改硷斗争的科学经验，虽然一再遭到走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”的刁难和诬蔑，但广大革命群众和贫下中农在毛泽东思想指引下，终于获得了成功。一九六六年，焦裕禄同志的战友张钦礼同志，带领兰考县大队以上干部来苗庄参观。兰考人民的深情厚谊，给苗庄人民以极大鼓励。三年来，苗庄大队共派出技术员五十九人次，帮助各地贫下中农进行改硷斗争。他们的经验得到广泛的传播。
    卑贱者最聪明
    苗庄大队改硷斗争的胜利，显示了毛泽东思想的无穷威力，再一次证明了毛主席“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”教导的无比英明正确。
    毛主席教导我们：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”苗庄大队的贫下中农，不但攻破了盐硷地植棉夺得高产的技术难关，解决了农业“专家”不能解决的难题，而且从改硷斗争的实践中培养了一支改硷植棉的技术队伍。这支队伍土里生，土里长，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕累，无限忠于毛主席，练就了一身十分过硬的本领。一九六六年，苗庄大队接受了兰考人民的邀请，派去几名社员帮助改硷植棉。他们活学活用毛泽东思想，和那里的贫下中农并肩战斗，用他们在实践斗争中总结出来的土办法，在三十二亩盐硷地上，取得了亩产皮棉一百三十七斤的好收成。广大贫下中农说：“土办法就是好。”
    苗庄的贫下中农把生产大队办成了活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，办成攻占科学技术阵地的试验场，培养农业科学技术人员的大学校。苗庄大队在改硷植棉以来，先后来过不少农业专家和技术人员，他们有的装出一副博学多识的架势，和贫下中农格格不入，出尽了洋相；有的虚心向贫下中农学习，走与贫下中农相结合的道路，受到了欢迎。四年前，来了一个年轻的技术员，由于受资产阶级教育路线的毒害，只想个人搞出点成绩来，大热天，还关在屋子里搞试验，酒精烧了三十多斤，取盐硷土千斤以上，仍然一无所获。贫下中农关切地对他说：“你烧酒精烧不出什么名堂来，多趟几年坷垃，多滚几身泥巴，就啥都能学会。”从此，他走出实验室和贫下中农学习、生活在一起，逐步建立了深厚的阶级感情。贫下中农无限忠于毛主席，勤劳艰苦的高贵品质深深教育了他。现在他不仅掌握了改造盐硷地的理论和技术，而且和贫下中农一起培育出三种棉花优良品种。贫下中农高兴地说：“这样的技术员是咱们自己人，我们是欢迎的。”
