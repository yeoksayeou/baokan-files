In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants, commune members, and revolutionary cadres in China's rural areas, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, have, while concentrating on revolution, bravely and tenaciously fought against nature and the elements. As a result, this year's agricultural production has, on the basis of continuous bumper harvests, achieved another bumper harvest. Poor peasants and revolutionary cadres throughout the country are enthusiastically hailing this as a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and as a fruitful achievement of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Autumn harvests have now basically been completed throughout the country. From the Songnen Plain to the banks of the Zhujiang River, from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the shores of the East China Sea, bumper harvest news is being reported from every corner of China's vast rural areas. Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Shanghai, and Beijing, among other provinces and municipalities, have this year increased their grain output by a considerable margin compared to last year's bumper harvest, achieving harvests rarely seen in their history. Among these, Hunan, Beijing, and Shanghai have set new historical records for grain output. The major grain-producing regions of Sichuan in the south and Heilongjiang in the north, as well as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jilin, Yunnan, Guangxi, Gansu, Tibet, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Fujian, Xinjiang, and other provinces and autonomous regions, have also achieved bumper harvests or good harvests this year. This year, cotton production has also been a bumper harvest nationwide. In Shanghai, Beijing, Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces and municipalities, despite relatively severe natural disasters, good or relatively good harvests have been achieved, with some cotton-producing areas setting new historical records for output. In addition, hemp, silkworm cocoons, tea, tobacco, fruits, and other economic crops have all been bumper harvests; oil crops have also had good yields. Throughout the south and north, a large number of high-yield and ultra-high-yield units, as well as low-yield units that have become high-yield units, have emerged. In the bumper harvest areas, many white-haired old poor peasants excitedly say: "In all my years, I've never seen such a good harvest. The rice is good, the cotton is good, everything is good, all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership."

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party points out: "The Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great impetus for socialist production in our country." The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great school for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thought. Broad masses of poor peasants and revolutionary cadres, in this great revolution, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, promoting the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought in rural areas across the country, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the people, which is the most important and fundamental guarantee for achieving this year's bumper harvest. Over the past year, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in China's vast rural areas have been increasingly numerous and increasingly effective. In many places, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have developed from being organized by leading organs to being voluntarily organized by the masses; from being held during farming off-seasons to being held even during busy farming seasons. In the fields, at the edges of the fields, in the homes, in the courtyards, everywhere is a classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. "Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions" has become the voluntary action of hundreds of millions of peasants. Through extensive and in-depth study, Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people. The broad masses of poor peasants and revolutionary cadres have increasingly heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines; throughout the country, a mass movement of "three loyalties"—loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line—has been launched.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great teachings, the broad masses of poor peasants, commune members, and revolutionary cadres throughout the country, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, have carried out extensive and sustained revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places who promoted the revisionist black goods of "the extinction of class struggle," "the fusion of public and private interests," "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and "work points as the commander" in rural areas, and eliminating their poisonous influence. During the autumn harvest busy season, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, and the broad masses of poor peasants, commune members, and revolutionary cadres, using the communiqué as a weapon, launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, further exposing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places who attempted to restore capitalism in rural areas.

At the same time, the broad masses of commune members, following Chairman Mao's teachings, voluntarily engaged in self-criticism, combining the criticism of revisionism with self-criticism. Through the extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor peasants and revolutionary cadres have come to hate the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi even more, and love the great leader Chairman Mao even more; they hate capitalism even more and love socialism even more, and their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes.

This year, the broad revolutionary masses in the northern provinces and municipalities of Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Beijing, Tianjin, Gansu, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Ningxia, under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels and with the support of the People's Liberation Army, have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," taking the heroic Dazhai Brigade as a shining example, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance of the Dazhai people, bravely and tenaciously fighting against natural disasters, and achieving one victory after another in the anti-disaster struggle. The broad masses of poor peasants in Hebei Province, which suffered from severe drought, put forward the battle cry of "fighting the drought until the heavens bow," and after arduous struggles, finally achieved a bumper harvest of cotton and a good harvest of grain. The suburbs of Beijing, after the anti-drought struggle, not only saw a significant increase in grain and cotton production, but other economic crops also had good yields. The poor peasants in the southern provinces and municipalities of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Yunnan, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to fight against nature, also achieved great victories in the struggle against disasters and for bumper harvests, overcoming varying degrees of drought and flood disasters, with many regions achieving bumper harvests.

This year, under the increasingly favorable revolutionary situation, the broad masses of poor peasants in China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have actively carried forward the revolutionary spirit of innovation, vigorously promoting agricultural technology, and created favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production. In the south and the north, the number of regions changing old farming systems is increasing. In Jiangsu and Shanghai, among other provinces and municipalities, many regions have changed from two crops a year to three, and in Shanxi and Beijing, among other provinces and municipalities, many regions have changed from one crop a year to two, all of which have powerfully promoted production. Chemical weeding, field seedling raising, mechanical transplanting, and other new technologies are also increasingly receiving attention. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the broad masses of people's communes in rural areas have planned and established small-scale industries, actively serving agricultural production. Over the past year, agricultural technological innovation has further played a powerful role in promoting this.

After achieving this year's bumper harvest in agriculture, the broad masses of poor peasants and commune members in China, with their proletarian feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao and for socialist motherland, are actively selling grain, cotton, and other agricultural products to the state, expressing their loyalty to beloved Chairman Mao. The broad masses of poor peasants and commune members are determined to further carry out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," with the support of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, to advance victoriously, seriously clean up the class ranks, actively carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, vigorously develop water conservancy projects for farmland, and focus on winter production. They will carry forward the spirit of frugal nation-building and frugal commune management to prepare for welcoming a new high tide in agricultural production and achieving an even greater bumper harvest in agricultural production next year.

The famous national agricultural labor model Li Shunda, leading the Xigou Brigade in Pingshun County, has high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrated on revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving this year's bumper harvest in agriculture.

    无产阶级文化大革命是生产的伟大推动力
    今年我国农业在连年丰收基础上又获丰收
    亿万贫下中农热烈欢呼：这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利
    决心进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，乘胜前进，认真清理阶级队伍，积极进行斗、批、改，发扬勤俭建国、勤俭办社的精神，迎接农业生产的新高潮，夺取明年农业生产的更大丰收
    新华社三日讯　在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国农村亿万贫下中农、社员群众、革命干部，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在狠抓革命的同时，英勇顽强地战天斗地，使今年的农业生产在连年丰收的基础上又一次获得丰收。各地贫下中农和革命干部满怀激情地热烈欢呼：这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果！
    目前全国秋收已经基本结束。从松嫩平原到珠江两岸，从西藏高原到东海之滨，我国辽阔的农村，丰收喜讯到处频传。安徽、江西、湖南、贵州、上海、北京等省、市，今年粮食产量比丰收的去年有较大幅度的增长，是这些地区历史上少见的丰收，其中湖南、北京、上海的粮食产量创造了历史上的最高水平。南方主要粮仓四川和北方主要粮仓黑龙江，以及广东、江苏、河南、湖北、浙江、吉林、云南、广西、甘肃、西藏、河北、陕西、山东、福建、新疆等省、区，今年粮食也获得了丰收或较好收成。今年全国棉花也获得了丰收。上海、北京、江苏、湖北、河南、安徽、河北、浙江、山东等省、市的棉花，在自然灾害比较严重的情况下仍夺得了好收成和较好收成，其中有些产棉区创造了历史上的最高产量。此外，麻类、蚕茧、茶叶、烟叶、水果等项经济作物，也是样样丰收；油料作物的收成也较好。南北各地还涌现了大批高产更高产，低产变高产的典型单位。丰收地区的许多白发苍苍的老贫农兴奋地说：“活了这一大把年纪，从来没有看到过这样的好年成。稻好，花好，样样好，全靠毛主席领导好。”
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是我国社会主义生产的伟大推动力。”伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。广大的贫下中农和革命干部，在这场大革命中活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，促使毛泽东思想在各地农村空前地大普及，大大促进了人的思想革命化，这是夺取今年农业丰收的最重要、最根本的保证。近一年来，我国广大农村各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，越办越多，越办越好。在许多地方，毛泽东思想学习班已由领导机关组织办，发展到群众自觉办；由农闲时办，发展到农忙时也坚持办。田间，地头，家庭，场院，到处都是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”，已成为亿万农民的自觉行动。通过广泛深入的学习，毛泽东思想空前深入人心，广大贫下中农和革命干部阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟越来越高；各地普遍掀起了群众性的无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动。
    毛主席教导说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”全国广大贫下中农、社员群众和革命干部遵照毛主席的伟大教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其各地区代理人在农村推行“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“公私溶化论”和“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，肃清其流毒。在秋收大忙季节，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了，广大贫下中农、社员群众和革命干部又以公报为武器，掀起革命大批判新高潮，进一步揭发和批判刘少奇及其在各地代理人妄图在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    与此同时，广大社员还按照毛主席的教导，自觉地斗私，把批修和斗私结合起来。通过深入开展革命大批判，广大贫下中农和革命干部对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇更加仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱；对资本主义更加仇恨，对社会主义更加热爱，精神面貌发生了极大的变化。
    今年我国北方的山东、河北、山西、陕西、辽宁、北京、天津、甘肃、青海、内蒙古、新疆、宁夏等省、市、区的广大革命群众，在各级革委会的领导和解放军的支持下，积极响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，以英雄的大寨大队为光辉榜样，发扬大寨人艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，英勇顽强地同自然灾害作斗争，取得了抗灾斗争的一个又一个胜利。遭受严重干旱的河北省的广大贫下中农豪迈地提出了“抗旱抗到天低头”的战斗口号，经过艰苦的斗争，终于夺得了棉花生产的大丰收，粮食也获得了较好的收成。北京市郊区经过抗旱斗争，不仅粮、棉大幅度增产，其它经济作物的收成也很好。我国南方的广东、广西、福建、江西、江苏、安徽、湖北、湖南、云南等省、区的贫下中农，靠毛泽东思想战天斗地，在抗灾夺丰收的斗争中也取得了巨大的胜利，战胜了程度不等的干旱和洪涝等灾害，其中不少地区获得了大丰收。
    今年，在革命形势越来越好的情况下，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国广大贫下中农，积极发扬革命首创精神，大力革新农业技术，也为促进农业生产的发展创造了有利的条件。在南方和北方，改变旧耕作制度的地区，越来越多。江苏、上海等省、市不少地区变一年两熟为三熟，山西、北京等省、市有不少地区变一年一熟为两熟，都有力地促进了生产。药剂除草、场地育秧、机械插秧等新技术，也正越来越广泛地受到人们的重视，广大农村人民公社在毛主席的“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，有计划地兴办小型工业，积极为农业生产服务，一年来对农业技术革新进一步发挥了有力的推动作用。
    我国广大贫下中农、社员群众，在获得今年农业丰收之后，怀着对毛主席、对社会主义祖国无限热爱的无产阶级感情，积极向国家交售粮、棉等农产品，向敬爱的毛主席表忠心。广大贫下中农、社员群众决心进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在中国人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持下，乘胜前进，认真清理阶级队伍，积极进行斗、批、改，大力兴修农田水利，大抓冬季生产，发扬勤俭建国、勤俭办社的精神，为迎接农业生产的新高潮，夺取明年农业生产的更大丰收作准备。（附图片）
