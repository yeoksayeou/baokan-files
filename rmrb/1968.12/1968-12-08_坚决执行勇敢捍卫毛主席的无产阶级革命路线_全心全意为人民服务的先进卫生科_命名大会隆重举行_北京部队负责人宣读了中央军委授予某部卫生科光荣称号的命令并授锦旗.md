The grand ceremony to confer the title of "Advanced Medical Unit Committed to Wholeheartedly Serving the People" was held in Beijing. The leader of the Beijing Military Region read the order from the Central Military Commission conferring the honorable title on a certain unit's medical unit and presented a banner.

A report from Xinhua News Agency on December 7th: Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved and the Central Military Commission issued an order to confer the honorable title of "Advanced Medical Unit Committed to Wholeheartedly Serving the People" on the medical unit of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region. The ceremony was held in Beijing.

The meeting began with the song "The East is Red." The attendees, filled with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, held high the red book of revolutionary quotations "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and read aloud together: "To stand firmly with the people of China, to serve the people of China wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." They jointly wished the great leader Chairman Mao long life! Long life!

Li Xuefeng, a leader of the Beijing Military Region, read the order from the Central Military Commission at the meeting and presented the banner "Advanced Medical Unit Committed to Wholeheartedly Serving the People" to the medical unit of a certain unit.

Zheng Weishan, a leader of the Beijing Military Region, spoke at the meeting. He said, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the conferring of the honorable title on the medical unit of a certain unit, which is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest motivation for us. He introduced the exemplary deeds of this medical unit in wholeheartedly serving the people and required all cadres and soldiers to earnestly learn from them, learn from their loyalty to Chairman Mao and the people, their firm stance in implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; learn from their facing the frontline and the masses, wholeheartedly serving the people with high moral qualities; learn from their reliance on the masses, breaking superstitions, and daring to practice revolutionary spirit; learn from their overcoming difficulties, being serious and meticulous scientific attitude; learn from their living and applying Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting proletarian politics, and the fundamental experience of political leadership over technology.

Zhang Qiuju, a female community member who had a ninety-pound tumor removed from her abdomen by this medical unit, denounced at the meeting the crimes of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line. She said, it was the number one capitalist-roader within the Party Liu Shaoqi and the bourgeois technical "authorities" who executed his counter-revolutionary revisionist line that let me die a living death. It was our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and the PLA who executed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that saved me. I will follow Chairman Mao's words for the rest of my life and be a good community member loyal to Chairman Mao.

The representative of the advanced medical unit spoke at the meeting and said, all our achievements are due to the great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, better face the frontline and the countryside, wholeheartedly serve the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, workers, and poor and lower-middle peasants, and continuously create new merits for the people.
