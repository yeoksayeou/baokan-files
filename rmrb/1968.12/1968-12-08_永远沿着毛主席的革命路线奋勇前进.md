The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Nanchui Village, Anyang County, who were praised by our great leader Chairman Mao in his 1955 commentary on the article "Who Says Chicken Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky," are inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions and have launched a widespread study of the history of the struggle between the two lines. In recent days, in the fields, at mealtimes, on irrigation projects, and in the homes of the villagers, everywhere people are recounting the history of the struggle of "chicken feathers flying to the sky."

The eighteen households of poor peasants who insisted on establishing the commune relived Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and his important commentary on the article "Who Says Chicken Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky." They studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with great enthusiasm. They recalled with joy the fierce struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line during the establishment of the commune in Nanchui Village. After the land reform, the poor peasants of Nanchui Village, following Chairman Mao's great directive to "organize," formed mutual aid teams and cooperatives, swiftly advancing towards the socialist collective farming path. The traitor Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The eighteen households of poor peasants firmly believed in Chairman Mao's directive that "only socialism can save China," and withstood the evil winds that attempted to destroy the cooperatives. The agricultural commune grew from small to large, increasing production year by year, and in less than three years, achieved full village collectivization.

In 1955, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote an important commentary on the experience of establishing the commune in Nanchui Village, "Who Says Chicken Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky." Chairman Mao said: "'Chicken feathers can't fly to the sky' was an ancient truth, but in the socialist era, it is no longer a truth. The poor will rise up. The old system will perish, and a new system will be born. Chicken feathers will indeed fly to the sky." Chairman Mao's great instructions pointed the way forward for Nanchui Village and farmers across the country, greatly inspiring the broad masses of poor peasants to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, the poor peasants of Nanchui Village, with the superiority of the socialist collective economy, defeated the capitalist spontaneous forces in the countryside, and agricultural production developed rapidly, improving the lives of the commune members. The "chicken feathers" rode the strong east wind of socialism, flying higher and higher.

Just as the poor peasants of Nanchui Village were advancing on the path of agricultural collectivization, the traitor Liu Shaoqi issued the black directive to "slash the cooperatives." The untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the countryside also took the opportunity to jump out, shouting slogans like "chicken feathers can't fly to the sky, and if they do, they will fall back down. The 'higher-ups' will cut down your cooperatives," inciting the uninformed masses to withdraw from the commune. Facing the mad attacks of a handful of class enemies on the socialist collective economy, the village party branch immediately organized the broad masses of poor peasants to study Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's important commentary on the article "Who Says Chicken Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky" over and over again. In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "Without the cooperative economy, we cannot lead the individual economy of the laboring masses to gradually move towards collectivization, we cannot develop from the new democratic society to the future socialist society, and we cannot consolidate the leadership of the proletariat in the state power." Chairman Mao's teachings greatly inspired the poor peasants of Nanchui Village. They loudly declared: "We will definitely follow the bright path of agricultural collectivization pointed out by Chairman Mao! If the sky falls, we will prop it up; if the earth sinks, we will fill it in. We will definitely run the commune well and bring glory to Chairman Mao!" They gave a resounding blow to the evil winds of "slashing the cooperatives" stirred up by Liu Shaoqi and the sabotage and disruption of a handful of class enemies in the countryside, further consolidating and developing the socialist collective economy. In the year of the Great Leap Forward, 1958, they took big strides onto the broad road of the people's commune.

Over the past decade, the heroic poor peasants of Nanchui Village, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have braved the storms of class struggle, from the primary commune to the advanced commune to the people's commune, bringing about a tremendous change in Nanchui Village. The grain yield per mu has increased from over 100 jin in the early days of liberation to over 980 jin, and the cotton yield per mu has increased from 15 jin to 137 jin.

Reviewing the history of the struggle between the two lines, the poor peasants of Nanchui Village love our great leader Chairman Mao even more and hate the traitor Liu Shaoqi even more. They say: "The history of 'chicken feathers flying to the sky' is the history of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line defeating Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. We must remember this historical experience. The struggle between the two lines, we must talk about it every day, every year, and every generation, forever marching forward along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!"

    永远沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进
    伟大领袖毛主席一九五五年在为《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文所加的按语中赞扬过的安阳县南崔庄大队的贫下中农和革命干部，在毛主席的最新指示鼓舞下，广泛开展了两条路线斗争史的学习运动。近日来，在田间地头、饭场、水利工地和社员家里，到处都在讲述“鸡毛上天”的斗争历史。
    当年坚持办社的十八户贫下中农，重温了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文的重要按语，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，心情特别激动，他们满怀胜利的喜悦，回顾了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线在南崔庄办社过程中进行的激烈斗争。土地改革后，南崔庄的贫下中农遵照毛主席“组织起来”的伟大教导，组织了互助组、合作社，向着社会主义农业集体化道路迅跑。叛徒刘少奇疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。十八户贫下中农坚信毛主席指示的“只有社会主义能够救中国”的伟大真理，顶住了妄图摧垮合作社的妖风。农业社由小变大，年年增产，不到三年，实现了全村合作化。
    一九五五年，我们伟大领袖毛主席为南崔庄的办社经验《谁说鸡毛不能上天》写下了重要按语。毛主席说：“‘鸡毛不能上天’这个古代的真理，在社会主义时代，它已经不是真理了。穷人要翻身了。旧制度要灭亡，新制度要出世了。鸡毛确实要上天了。”毛主席的伟大指示，给南崔庄和全国农民，指明了前进的方向，极大地激发了广大贫下中农进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的热情。在毛主席光辉指示的鼓舞下，南崔庄的贫下中农以社会主义集体经济的优越性，击败了农村中的资本主义自发势力，农业生产飞速发展，社员生活大大改善，“鸡毛”乘着社会主义的强劲东风，越飞越高。
    正当南崔庄贫下中农在农业集体化的道路上阔步前进的时候，叛徒刘少奇抛出了“大砍合作社”的黑指示，农村中没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子也趁机跳了出来，叫嚣什么“鸡毛上不了天，上天还要落下来，‘上级’要把你们的合作社砍掉了”，煽动不明真相的群众闹退社。大队党支部面对一小撮阶级敌人向社会主义集体经济的疯狂进攻，立即组织广大贫下中农一遍又一遍地学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席为《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文所写的重要按语。伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告中极其深刻地指出：“单有国营经济而没有合作社经济，我们就不可能领导劳动人民的个体经济逐步地走向集体化，就不可能由新民主主义社会发展到将来的社会主义社会，就不可能巩固无产阶级在国家政权中的领导权。”毛主席的教导，极大地鼓舞了南崔庄的贫下中农，他们响亮地说：“毛主席给我们指出的农业集体化的光明大道我们走定了！天塌下来我们顶，地陷下去我们填。我们一定要办好合作社，为毛主席争光！”他们对刘少奇刮起的“大砍合作社”的妖风和农村中一小撮阶级敌人的破坏捣乱，给以迎头痛击，从而进一步巩固和发展了社会主义集体经济，并在大跃进的一九五八年大踏步地迈上了人民公社的康庄大道。
    十几年来，英雄的南崔庄贫下中农在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，迎着阶级斗争的风浪，由初级社、高级社到人民公社，使南崔庄发生了天翻地覆的变化，粮食亩产量由解放初期的一百多斤提高到九百八十多斤，棉花亩产量由十五斤提高到一百三十七斤。
    回顾两条路线斗争的历史，南崔庄的贫下中农更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加痛恨叛徒刘少奇。他们说：“鸡毛上天”的历史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线击败刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线的历史。这种历史的经验，我们一定要牢记，两条路线的斗争，我们要天天讲，年年讲，代代讲，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！
