Residents of Tianjin's Hongshunli Lane have launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism against the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. Every household has become a battleground for exposing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes. Retired old workers, ordinary housewives, and teenagers all fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, significantly raising their awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle.

New China News Agency, Tianjin, December 5th: In Tianjin's Hongshunli Lane, where the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi once spread poison, the revolutionary residents have launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism against Liu Shaoqi. The thousands of households scattered throughout the alleys have become thousands of battlegrounds for exposing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes. White-haired retired workers, ordinary housewives, and teenagers all fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology. Hongshunli Lane has over 6,000 households, with residents scattered throughout. The lane is predominantly populated by elderly people and housewives, with many household chores to attend to. The Hongshunli Lane Revolutionary Committee repeatedly studied the call from the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee to "continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism and thoroughly purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist-roaders within the party." They mobilized the residents to deeply engage in revolutionary criticism, tailored to the characteristics of the lane residents. The main practices of the Hongshunli Lane Revolutionary Committee in guiding the residents to engage in revolutionary criticism are as follows:

First, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," they organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using this good form to organize the thousands of households scattered throughout the alleys. They divided the entire lane's over 6,000 households into thirteen residential areas, establishing over 120 study classes. There are neighborhood, courtyard, family, retired workers, youth, and street activists' study classes, among others. The variety of study class types and flexible forms make it convenient for housewives with many household chores to participate, and criticism battles are set up everywhere.

Second, tailored to the characteristics of the lane residents, criticism meetings advocate for brief speeches, with each person criticizing one of Liu Shaoqi's fallacies based on their personal experiences, purging one stream of poison. In July 1958, Liu Shaoqi once spread poison in Hongshunli Lane. Everyone criticized based on what they saw and heard, making the criticism vivid and powerful. Retired worker Zhao Dezhen said, "Back then, this bad guy Liu Shaoqi told us, 'You should enjoy some comfort, stroll in the garden, and entertain the children.' 'You are now eating a little and wasting a little.' This big bad guy pretended to care for us but actually aimed to dull our revolutionary will, making us only know how to eat, drink, and play, forgetting about class struggle." Housewife Ma Guizhen criticized Liu Shaoqi's emphasis on eating and drinking during his visit to Hongshunli Lane, spreading bourgeois lifestyle ideas, saying, "Liu Shaoqi's talk was full of black words and poisoned arrows, aiming to drag us onto the capitalist road. It was extremely malicious." After spreading poison in Hongshunli Lane in 1958, Liu Shaoqi did not stop. To build his reputation, he instructed a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the old Tianjin Municipal Committee to demolish 750 civilian houses, 8 factories, and 4 shops in Hongshunli Lane, causing trouble and expense, and built the Hongshunli Building. Two years later, the building was completed, but it was not allowed to have stoves, required elegant indoor furniture, and had expensive rent and utilities, increasing the burden on the working people. Liu Shaoqi shamelessly claimed that this was the "sprout of communism." Resident Zhang Chengrui criticized this incident, saying, "Liu Shaoqi's mind was full of bourgeois ideas. He is our working people's enemy. The Eighth Plenum's decision to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and remove this piece of junk is truly satisfying!"

Third, using exhibitions of real objects and cartoons, among other easy-to-understand forms, to deepen the revolutionary criticism. In 1958, Liu Shaoqi once spread the theory of "extinguishing class struggle" in Hongshunli Lane, claiming that "there are fewer things to do at the police station now," and "the police station can be abolished." He ordered the basic power of the lane to be changed to a "production and service cooperative," opening the door for class enemies to come out in droves. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially during the cleanup of class ranks, the revolutionary residents exposed the hidden class enemies in the lane, including big bullies, escaped landlord elements, reactionary capitalists, and counter-revolutionaries. The lane revolutionary committee then held exhibitions of real objects and cartoons about class struggle, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of "extinguishing class struggle," and conducted universal class education among the working people, with good results. Housewife Tang Lanying said, "Liu Shaoqi kept shouting that class struggle has been extinguished, aiming to dull us working people, letting those class enemies come out to seize our power and oppress us again. If we do not want to suffer twice, we must thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi, the number one bad guy, and his counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, purging its poison, and defending our proletarian dictatorship's mountains and rivers from changing color!"

Fourth, linking the criticism of Liu Shaoqi with the specific facts of class struggle in the lane, deeply excavating and criticizing. Hongshunli Lane has a "Happiness Courtyard," which once housed eight people, including big bullies, descendants of Yuan Shikai and reactionary capitalists, and was not set up for the working people. It was originally established according to Liu Shaoqi's black instructions during his visit to Hongshunli Lane. Housewives linked this incident to their criticism, further realizing that Liu Shaoqi is the backer of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and that landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are the reactionary social base for Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism.

Fifth, organizing a core team to lead and organize the lane residents in engaging in revolutionary criticism.

In Hongshunli Lane, there are now study classes in every courtyard, and criticism meetings every day. In the new wave of revolutionary criticism against Liu Shaoqi, the spiritual face of housewives and lane residents has undergone profound changes, significantly raising their awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become more widespread and in-depth among the lane residents. Recently, after studying and implementing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum, the lane residents, under the leadership of the army and the lane revolutionary committee, have combined criticism with the in-depth cleanup of class ranks, exposing another batch of hidden class enemies in the lane.

    天津鸿顺里街居民掀起革命大批判高潮
    家家户户都成了清算刘少奇滔天罪行的战场，退休老工人、普通家庭妇女、十几岁的娃娃，人人狠批反革命修正主义思想，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟
    新华社天津五日电  在叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇曾经去放过毒的天津市鸿顺里街，广大革命的街道居民，对刘少奇掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。分散于胡同里巷的千家万户，变成了千万个清算刘少奇滔天罪行的战场。白发苍苍的退休老工人，普通的家庭妇女，十几岁的娃娃，人人狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想。鸿顺里街居民有六千多户，居住分散。街道居民中老年人多，家庭妇女多，家务事情也多。鸿顺里街革命委员会反复学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会发出的要“继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想”的号召，针对街道居民的特点，充分发动他们深入开展了革命的大批判。鸿顺里街革委会引导革命居民深入开展革命大批判的主要做法是：
    第一，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，用学习班这个好形式把分散在胡同里巷的千家万户组织起来。他们把全街六千多户居民分成十三个居民区，办起了一百二十多个学习班，不但有片的、院的、家庭的学习班，还有退休老工人学习班，少年儿童学习班，街道积极分子学习班，等等。学习班的类型多，形式灵活，便于家务事情多的家庭妇女参加，到处都摆开了大批判的战场。
    第二，针对街道居民特点，批判会提倡发言简短，各人根据亲身感受批判刘少奇的一个谬论，肃清其一股流毒。一九五八年七月，刘少奇曾经到鸿顺里大肆放毒。大家就根据自己看到的、听到的事情，开展批判，生动有力。退休老工人赵德珍说：“当年，刘少奇这个坏家伙对我们说，‘你们该享享福了，遛遛花园，再哄哄小孩。’‘你们现在是吃一点落一点。’这个大坏蛋表面装着对我们关心，实际是麻痹我们的革命意志，让我们光知道吃喝玩乐，忘记阶级斗争。”家庭妇女马桂珍针对刘少奇到鸿顺里来专门向人讲吃讲喝，散布资产阶级生活方式，在会上批判说：“刘少奇鼓吹的那一套，就是想让我们不关心国家大事。他说的是黑话，放的是毒箭，就是想把我们往资本主义道路上拉，真是恶毒透顶。”刘少奇一九五八年在鸿顺里放毒以后，还不肯罢休，他为了给自己树碑立传，指使旧天津市委内一小撮走资派在鸿顺里拆了七百五十多间民房、八个工厂和四所商店，劳民伤财，盖了鸿顺里大楼。二年以后，大楼盖好了，一不许生火炉，二要屋内家具摆设讲究，房租水电都贵，给劳动人民增加了负担，刘少奇还恬不知耻地胡说什么这就是“共产主义幼芽”。居民张成瑞就这件事在批判会上说：“刘少奇满脑子想的是资产阶级那一套，他是我们劳动人民的死对头。党的八届十二中全会决定把刘少奇永远开除出党，清除这个大废料，真是大快人心！”
    第三，用实物展览、漫画展览等通俗易懂的形式，配合深入开展革命大批判。刘少奇一九五八年曾经在鸿顺里大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，叫嚷什么“现在派出所的事情不多了”，“派出所也可以不要了”，并且下令把街道的基层政权改为“生产服务合作社”，给阶级敌人纷纷出笼大开方便之门。在无产阶级文化大革命中，特别是在清理阶级队伍的时候，广大革命居民揪出了隐藏在街道里的大恶霸、逃亡地主分子、反动资本家和反革命分子以后，街革委会就用这些真人真事举办了阶级斗争的实物展览和漫画展览，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，对劳动人民普遍进行阶级教育，效果很好。家庭妇女汤兰英说：“刘少奇拚命叫嚷阶级斗争熄灭了，就是要麻痹我们劳动人民，让那些阶级敌人跑出来专我们的政，再来压迫我们。我们要不受二遍苦，就要把刘少奇这个头号大坏蛋的反革命修正主义思想彻底批倒批臭，肃清其流毒，保卫我们无产阶级专政的江山永不变色！”
    第四，把批判刘少奇同本街道阶级斗争的具体事实紧密联系起来，深挖狠批。鸿顺里街有个“幸福院”，曾经住过八个人，其中有大恶霸，有袁世凯和反动资本家的家属，根本不是给劳动人民设立的，原来这是根据刘少奇到鸿顺里时下的黑指示办的。家庭妇女们联系这件事进行批判，更清楚地认识到：刘少奇就是地、富、反、坏、右的总后台，地、富、反、坏、右就是刘少奇复辟资本主义的反动社会基础。
    第五，组织一支骨干队伍，带动和组织街道居民开展革命大批判。
    在鸿顺里街，现在院院有学习班，天天有批判会。在对刘少奇开展革命大批判的新高潮中，家庭妇女和街道居民的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动在街道居民中更加广泛深入地展开。最近，经过学习和落实党的八届十二中全会公报，街道居民们在解放军和街革委会的领导下，结合大批判深入开展清理阶级队伍的工作，又挖出了一批隐藏在街道里的阶级敌人。
