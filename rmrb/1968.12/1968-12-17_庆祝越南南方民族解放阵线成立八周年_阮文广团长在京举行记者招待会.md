	Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: Nguyen Van Hieu, Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing today to celebrate the 8th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. At the press conference, Nguyen Van Hieu exposed the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in its aggression against South Vietnam and introduced the tremendous victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and people in the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

	He said, the people of South Vietnam have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and as long as there is one American aggressor on our land, we will continue to fight and drive them all out; overthrow the traitorous, sellout clique, seize all power back into the hands of the people, and excellently complete the tasks of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the country.

	Nguyen Van Hieu said, Vietnam and China are brotherly neighboring countries with mountains and rivers connecting us. The two countries' peoples have a long-standing tradition of unity, fighting together, and winning together in their revolutionary struggles. The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front are deeply moved by Chairman Mao's words in his congratulatory message to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, that "700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." All South Vietnamese military personnel and people regard Chairman Mao's words as a great encouragement to themselves.

    庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年
    阮文广团长在京举行记者招待会
    新华社十六日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，为庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年，今天在北京举行中外记者招待会。阮文广团长在记者招待会上揭露了美帝国主义侵略越南南方的滔天罪行；介绍了越南南方军民在抗美救国战争中所取得的巨大胜利。
    他说，越南南方人民热烈响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团和胡志明主席的号召，只要在我国土地上还有一个美国侵略者，我们就要继续战斗，把它全部赶出去；打倒越奸卖国集团，把全部政权夺回人民手中，出色地完成解放南方、保卫北方、进而和平统一祖国的任务。
    阮文广说，越南和中国是山连山、水连水的兄弟邻邦。越中两国人民在长期的革命斗争中就存在着团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起的优良传统。越南南方人民和民族解放阵线对毛主席在越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年时给阮友寿主席的贺电中所说的“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方”，深受感动。全体越南南方军民把毛主席的话看作是对自己的巨大鼓舞。
