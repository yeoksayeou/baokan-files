In the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, a vigorous campaign of great criticism is being carried out.

The revolutionary masses of Anhui Province enthusiastically praise the correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and angrily denounce the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This has raised their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, pushing the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts in the province to develop in depth.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 10th: In accordance with Chairman Mao's latest directive, "The experience of history is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly spoken about. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses," the revolutionary masses of Anhui Province, in implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and in earnestly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, have launched a massive movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines. Through this study, the revolutionary masses' consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been continuously raised, thereby further strengthening their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and powerfully promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts to develop in depth.

After Chairman Mao's latest directive was issued, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Anhui Province, with a spirit of "seizing the day," used various forms to widely and deeply propagate it to the 35 million people of the province, quickly making it known to every household and every individual. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the broad revolutionary masses responded enthusiastically, setting up tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes centered on studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. Counties and cities also held meetings with more than ten thousand people, angrily denouncing Liu Shaoqi's treason against the party and the country, his promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and his attempt to restore capitalism, and enthusiastically praising the correctness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad revolutionary masses said, "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of the proletariat and the working people. It is the only correct line that guides the Chinese revolution to complete victory. We must always, in all things and in all places, speak about the struggle between the two lines and use Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to unify all our actions."

In studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the most prominent feature of the revolutionary masses of Anhui Province is that they closely combine learning with carrying out revolutionary great criticism, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, raising the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary great criticism to a new level. In the old revolutionary base areas of the Anti-Japanese War in eastern Anhui, such as Luan, Dingyuan, and Tianchang, large-scale meetings to expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi were held. Many old guerrilla fighters, old soldiers of the New Fourth Army, and poor and lower-middle peasants who participated in the Anti-Japanese War at that time, as eyewitnesses to history, used ironclad facts to expose Liu Shaoqi's treacherous, traitorous, and counter-revolutionary face, greatly raising the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses said, "Only Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can save China and save us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

After liberation, Liu Shaoqi, through his agents in Anhui, promoted a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines, attempting to turn Anhui into a base for his restoration of capitalism. He also visited Anhui twice, spreading a large amount of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods in Hefei, Huainan, Bengbu, Wuhu, Ma'anshan, and Suzhou. The broad revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary fallacies, criticizing them to the point of being unbearable and thoroughly eliminating their poison. The workers and soldiers of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company set up revolutionary great criticism battlefields everywhere, in front of the steel and iron furnaces, in the workshops, and on the roadsides, fiercely exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods that Liu Shaoqi promoted in Ma'anshan, such as "expert management," "technology first," and "bonus incentives," further clarifying what Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is, and greatly enhancing their awareness of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Fuziling People's Commune in Hushan County held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly reviewing Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee, angrily denouncing Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui for slashing cooperatives, destroying people's communes, and forcibly promoting "responsibility fields" and "three self and one contract," and enthusiastically praising the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, determined to carry the struggle between the two lines to the end.

In the process of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad revolutionary masses on all fronts in Anhui Province repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "Throughout the entire socialist period, there exist classes and class struggle. This class struggle is long-term, complex, and sometimes very intense. Our dictatorship tools cannot be weakened but must be strengthened," further enhancing their sense of responsibility to defend the proletarian dictatorship and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship. They said, "The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is centered on the issue of power. We must talk about this issue every day, every month, and every year. We must criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, which attempts to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism, to the point of being unbearable, and raise our awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and defending the proletarian dictatorship to the highest level, ensuring that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color for thousands of years and ten thousand generations.

    在学习两条路线斗争史中深入开展大批判
    安徽广大革命群众热烈赞颂毛主席革命路线的英明正确，愤怒控诉刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，从而提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动着全省各条战线斗批改向纵深发展
    据新华社合肥十日电　遵照毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，安徽省广大革命群众在落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务和认真搞好斗、批、改的过程中，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的学习两条路线斗争史的群众运动。通过学习，广大革命群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，从而更增强了执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性，有力地推动了各条战线斗、批、改向纵深发展。
    毛主席的最新指示发表后，安徽省各级革委会都以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，运用多种形式，向全省三千五百万人民进行广泛深入的宣传，迅速做到家喻户晓，人人皆知。广大革命群众在各级革委会领导下，闻风而动，办起了成千上万的以学习两条路线斗争史为中心的毛泽东思想学习班。各县、市还召开了万人以上的大会，愤怒声讨刘少奇叛党叛国，推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，热烈赞颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英明正确。广大革命群众说，毛主席的革命路线，是无产阶级和劳动人民的生命线，是指引中国革命取得彻底胜利的唯一正确路线，我们就是要时时、事事、处处讲两条路线斗争，用毛主席革命路线统一我们的一切行动。
    安徽省广大革命群众在学习两条路线斗争史中，最显著的特点是，把学习和开展革命大批判紧密结合起来，狠批刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动和革命大批判提高到一个新的水平。皖东抗日战争时期革命老根据地来安、定远、天长等县，都召开了声势浩大的大揭大批刘少奇的大会，许多参加当年抗日战争的老游击队员、新四军老战士和贫下中农，都以历史见证人的身份，用铁一般的事实揭露了刘少奇的大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼的丑恶嘴脸，极大地提高了广大革命群众两条路线斗争的觉悟。广大革命群众说，只有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能救中国，救我们贫下中农！
    解放后，刘少奇通过他在安徽的代理人，推行了一整套反革命修正主义路线，妄图把安徽变成他复辟资本主义的基地。他还先后两次窜到安徽，在合肥、淮南、蚌埠、芜湖、马鞍山、宿县等地散布了大量的反革命修正主义黑货。广大革命群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了刘少奇的反革命谬论，把它批得臭不可闻，彻底肃清其流毒。马鞍山钢铁公司的工人和解放军指战员，在炼钢和炼铁炉旁，在车间，在路边，到处摆开革命大批判的战场，狠揭猛批刘少奇在马钢推销的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“奖金挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，进一步认清了什么是毛主席的革命路线，大大增强了保卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性。霍山县佛子岭人民公社贫下中农举办毛泽东思想学习班，反复重温毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，愤怒地声讨了刘少奇及其在安徽的代理人大砍合作社，破坏人民公社，强行推行“责任田”、“三自一包”的罪行，热烈赞颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，决心把两条路线斗争进行到底。
    安徽省各条战线上的广大革命群众在学习两条路线斗争史的过程中，反复地学习了毛主席“整个社会主义阶段，存在着阶级和阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争是长期的、复杂的，有时甚至是很激烈的。我们的专政工具不能削弱，还应当加强”的教导，进一步增强了保卫无产阶级政权，加强无产阶级专政的责任感。他们说，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中心是政权问题，我们对于这个问题要天天讲、月月讲、年年讲，我们一定要把刘少奇妄图颠覆无产阶级专政、实行资本主义复辟的反革命修正主义路线批得臭臭的，把执行毛主席的革命路线，保卫无产阶级政权的自觉性提得高高的，保证无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
