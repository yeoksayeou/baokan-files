The Chinese working class, in response to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, "The working class must lead everything," has proudly taken the stage of the struggle, criticism, and reform of the superstructure, realizing the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure. This is the grand triumphant song of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, a great feat of the 1960s.

Our victory has struck fear into the hearts of a small clique of traitors in the Kremlin. They have activated their propaganda machines to viciously slander our country's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering institutions of higher learning. The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, *Izvestia*, even went so far as to say that the Chinese Communist Party "does not trust" workers, that it "diminishes" the role of the working class, and even defames members of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams as the "backward elements" of the Chinese working class. What utter lies! Utterly shameless!

Gold is not afraid of fire, and facts speak louder than words. Our workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams are entrusted with the heavy responsibility of leading the proletarian educational revolution and re-educating the broad masses of intellectuals in the name of Chairman Mao. There, we have led the broad revolutionary intellectuals in their struggle against the enemy; we have, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and in the conscious struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, we have swept away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology. We have taken to the podiums of universities to expound on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class is firmly grasping the reins of education and the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a magnificent revolutionary scene. Just take our factory as an example: now, an ordinary female fitter is leading the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team at Peking University, and another worker has become a leader of the revolutionary committee of a medical college. Moreover, we have demonstrated the power of "the working class must lead everything" in the fields of science, technology, and production, achieving bountiful results. During the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, our factory workers criticized the great traitor Liu Shaoqi's idolization of foreigners and "authorities," his "slave mentality" and "crawling philosophy," and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, designed and manufactured a grinder with the highest level of smoothness for both internal and external surfaces, far surpassing the technological level of the Soviet revisionists. On the eve of our country's 19th National Day, our factory received a precious gift from Chairman Mao—a mango; our factory's worker representatives were invited to the Zhongnanhai by Chairman Mao; more than 100 worker representatives from our factory were warmly received by Chairman Mao. In the face of these ironclad facts, the lies and slander of the Soviet revisionist traitors are not only laughable but also utterly absurd!

Shameful Soviet revisionist traitors, take a look at your own ugly faces in the mirror! It is you who have fully restored capitalism within the Soviet Union, turning the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship, transforming the homeland of the October Revolution into a paradise for vampires. It is you who have ruthlessly suppressed the Soviet working class and laboring people, stripping them of all their rights, and sending the outstanding sons and daughters of the working class from the era of Lenin and Stalin to the eighteenth level of hell. Arbitrarily firing, expelling, arresting, and killing workers has become your daily routine. In Georgia, you exiled lumber workers loyal to the revolutionary cause of Lenin and Stalin to the border; in the city of Chimkent in Central Asia, you deployed tanks to brutally suppress the demonstrations of automobile workers; in a factory in Kirov Oblast, you punished 125 workers in one year; in five automobile companies in Moscow and Leningrad, you fired 239 workers in just five months. Is this your so-called "trust" in the working class? You butchers, with the blood of the Soviet working class on your hands, what right do you have to utter a single word in front of us?!

The traitors and scoundrels Brezhnev and Kosygin have done such filthy deeds, yet they have the audacity to boast that they have always "learned from Lenin" and "followed Lenin's teachings." This is truly shameless. The great Lenin had long predicted, "In history, there are often cases where, after the death of revolutionary leaders who were highly respected in the oppressed classes, their enemies attempt to steal their names to deceive the oppressed classes." Is this not exactly what you Soviet revisionist traitors are doing? Your traitorous faces, no matter how beautifully you dress them up, cannot be covered. Your barking at the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class like mad dogs, precisely indicates that our revolutionary actions have hit your vital points. Your slanders and defamations neither harm a single hair of the great Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class nor can they stop the Soviet people's yearning for New China. The heroic sons and daughters of the October Revolution will, as stated in the "Stalin Group" leaflets, "throw themselves into the battle to rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union," and overthrow you, this small clique of shameless scoundrels, making the red star over the Kremlin shine again.

"As the west wind falls and the leaves descend upon Chang'an, the arrows fly and cry." Let the small clique of scoundrels in Moscow wail in despair! The great wheel of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in China is rolling forward amidst the high-spirited triumphant songs of the revolutionary people!

    革命的凯歌和工贼的悲鸣
    北京第二机床厂工人评论组
    中国工人阶级响应我们伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大号召，昂首阔步地登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的舞台，实现无产阶级在上层建筑对资产阶级的全面专政。这是无产阶级文化大革命的雄壮凯歌，是二十世纪六十年代的伟大创举。
    我们的胜利使克里姆林宫里一小撮叛徒吓破了胆。他们开动宣传机器，对我国工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻大专院校进行恶毒的诬蔑。苏修叛徒集团的喉舌《消息报》竟然胡说什么中国共产党“不信任”工人呀，什么“贬低”工人阶级的作用呀，甚至诽谤工人毛泽东思想宣传队的成员是中国工人阶级的“落后部分”呀，等等。真是睁着眼睛说瞎话！无耻透顶！
    真金不怕火炼，事实胜于雄辩。我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队是肩负着工人阶级及其伟大领袖毛主席的重托进驻大专院校的。在那里，我们遵照毛主席的教导卓有成效地领导着无产阶级教育革命，对广大知识分子进行再教育。我们带领广大革命知识分子，开展对敌斗争；我们同广大革命师生一起开办毛泽东思想学习班，在自觉的斗私批修中肃清资产阶级和小资产阶级思想；我们登上了大学讲坛，讲解马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想……。伟大领袖毛主席领导下的中国工人阶级正在牢牢地掌握着教育大权，掌握着无产阶级政权。这是一幅空前壮丽的革命图画。就拿我们工厂来说，现在就有一位普通的女钳工在北京大学担任工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导，还有另一位工人已经成为一所医学院的革命委员会的领导人。不仅如此，我们还把“工人阶级必须领导一切”的威力发挥到科学技术和生产阵地，取得了丰硕的成果。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我厂工人批判了大叛徒刘少奇的迷信外国，迷信“权威”的“洋奴思想”和“爬行哲学”，在毛泽东思想的指引下，设计并制成了内孔和外圆磨削都达到最高级光洁度的世界水平的磨床，远远超过了苏修的技术水平。在我国十九周年国庆前夕，我们厂接到了毛主席赠送的珍贵礼品——芒果；我厂的工人代表受到毛主席的邀请到中南海作客；我厂一百多名工人代表受到毛主席的亲切接见。在这一切铁的事实面前，苏修叛徒们的撒谎和诽谤，岂不令人发笑？！岂不荒唐之至？！
    可耻的苏修叛徒们，还是用镜子照一照你们自己那副丑恶的嘴脸吧！正是你们，在苏联国内全面复辟资本主义，把无产阶级专政变成了资产阶级专政，把好端端的一个十月革命的故乡，变成为吸血鬼的天堂。正是你们，疯狂地镇压苏联工人阶级和劳动人民，剥夺了他们的一切权利，把列宁、斯大林时代的工人阶级的优秀儿女，打入十八层地狱。随便解雇、开除、逮捕、杀害工人，已经成为你们的家常便饭。在格鲁吉亚，你们把忠诚于列宁和斯大林革命事业的木材工人流放边疆；在中亚细亚的奇姆肯特，你们出动坦克残酷镇压汽车工人的示威；在基尔罗伏州的一个企业中，一年就处罚了一百二十五名工人；在莫斯科和列宁格勒的五家汽车公司里，五个月就解雇了二百三十九名工人……。难道这一切就是你们对工人阶级的
  “信任”吗？你们这些双手沾满了苏联工人阶级鲜血的刽子手们，有什么资格在我们面前哼一声呢？！
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒和工贼干了如此肮脏的勾当，却厚着脸皮吹嘘自己“一贯求教于列宁”，“遵照列宁的遗训”，真是不知人间有羞耻事。伟大的列宁早就预言，“历史上常有这种情形：当那些在被压迫阶级中素享盛名的革命领袖一旦逝世以后，他们的敌人便企图窃取他们的名字来欺骗被压迫阶级。”苏修叛徒们，你们不就是这样干的吗？你们的工贼嘴脸，无论用什么漂亮的言辞也掩盖不住的。你们对中国共产党和中国工人阶级的狂犬吠日般的辱骂，恰恰说明了我们的革命行动打中了你们的要害。你们的诬蔑和诽谤，既无损于伟大的中国共产党和中国工人阶级的一根毫毛，也丝毫抵制不了苏联人民对新中国的向往。十月革命的英雄儿女一定会象“斯大林小组”传单中所说的那样：“投身到重建苏联无产阶级专政的战斗中去”，把你们这一小撮无耻的工贼统统打倒，让克里姆林宫上空的红星重放光芒。
    “正西风落叶下长安，飞鸣镝。”让莫斯科的一小撮工贼绝望悲鸣去吧！伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨轮正在革命人民高亢的凯歌声中滚滚向前！　新华社稿
