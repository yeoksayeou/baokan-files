Title: "Three Horses and One Cart" is the Wicked Car of Capitalist Restoration

	The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out clearly at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "The ninety percent of the national economy's total output value that is made up of the dispersed individual agricultural and handicraft economies can and must be guided cautiously, gradually, and actively toward modernization and collectivization. The idea of letting things take their own course is wrong." Chairman Mao has shown us the broad path to eliminating rural capitalism and advancing toward socialist collectivization.

	However, the agents of the landlords, rich peasants, and bourgeoisie, such as Liu Shaoqi, have fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Soon after liberation, he vigorously advocated for the development of the rich peasant economy. He even went so far as to say, "Within a few years, households with three horses, one plow, and one cart should make up eighty percent." But he was afraid of being exposed, so he also argued, "Does a farmer with three horses, one plow, and one cart count as a rich peasant? No, this is not a rich peasant, but a middle peasant!" This is all nonsense.

	What are landlords and rich peasants? We poor and lower-middle peasants know best.

	In the old society, I worked for a rich peasant in my village for over twenty years. Besides one person working, he hired four laborers, operated 154 mu of land, owned a cart, and raised two horses and a donkey. In a normal year, he harvested over 35 dan of grain. If he didn't exploit hired labor, how could he harvest so much grain! Can such a household be called a "middle peasant" instead of a rich peasant? This rich peasant also used animal labor and tools to open a "cattle workshop," run a cart service, and engage in other forms of exploitation. He also used his surplus grain and money to lend to poor people, engaging in usury. My family, for three generations, worked for landlords and rich peasants but could never eat our fill or keep warm. My father wore a quilted jacket for twelve years until he died without ever taking it off. I had a younger brother who starved to death at the age of fourteen.

	It is clear that Liu Shaoqi's development of the middle peasant economy is a cover for developing the rich peasant economy. He himself admitted early on: "Hiring labor, individual farming, should be left to take its own course," "It's good to have a few rich peasants emerge." He even shouted, "The policy of preserving the rich peasant economy is a long-term policy." This barefacedly reveals that the traitor Liu Shaoqi, in advocating for "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style households, is not intending to follow the socialist path but the capitalist path.

	As for Liu Shaoqi's claim that "households with three horses, one plow, and one cart should make up eighty percent in a few years," this is pure deception. I have worked for rich peasants and know their greed for wealth. A rich peasant who has three horses today will want four or five tomorrow, and even more. The result is that wealth becomes more and more concentrated in the hands of a few landlords and rich peasants, while the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants become poorer and poorer. Because the agents of Liu Shaoqi in our city vigorously advocated for the development of the rich peasant economy, spreading the idea that "to get rich, you must buy a cart and a horse," our village experienced severe polarization. Out of 190 households of poor and lower-middle peasants, twelve sold their land or houses, ten worked for others, fifteen were burdened with debt, and most of those who lent money and bought land were new-style rich peasants with "three horses, one plow, and one cart." We poor and lower-middle peasants were again facing the danger of going backward. The path of individual farming will not result in "eighty percent of farmers having three horses, one plow, and one cart," but will likely result in eighty percent or more of the poor becoming destitute; it will not result in "good collective farms," but will certainly produce new rich peasants and landlord estates! It was Chairman Mao who timely showed us the path of collectivization, stopping this evil trend.

	The facts fully prove that Liu Shaoqi's "three horses, one plow, and one cart" is a thorough and complete wicked car of capitalist restoration, and Liu Shaoqi is the black driver of this wicked car. His evil intention is to try to drag socialist China back to the dark old society.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and walk the socialist path generation after generation. We resolutely respond to the great battle call of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, never forget the history of the struggle between the two lines, and sweep Liu Shaoqi and his "three horses, one plow, and one cart" into the dustbin of history.

### “三马一车”是复辟资本主义的邪马贼车

    “三马一车”是复辟资本主义的邪马贼车
    辽宁省辽阳市西马峰公社野老滩大队贫农　吴润泉
    伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上英明地指出：“占国民经济总产值百分之九十的分散的个体的农业经济和手工业经济，是可能和必须谨慎地、逐步地而又积极地引导它们向着现代化和集体化的方向发展的，任其自流的观点是错误的。”毛主席他老人家为我们指明了消灭农村资本主义、走社会主义集体化的康庄大道。
    可是，地主、富农和资产阶级的代理人刘少奇，疯狂地反对毛主席的革命路线。解放后不久，他便极力鼓吹发展富农经济。他竟说什么：“三马一犁一车的农户，在数年后应发展到百分之八十。”但他作贼心虚，生怕露了馅，又诡辩说：“有三匹马、一副犁、一挂车的农民算不算富农？这不是富农，是中农！”这完全是胡说八道。
    什么是地主、富农？咱贫下中农最清楚。
    在旧社会，我给本村一个富农扛了二十多年大活。他家除了一个人劳动以外，雇了四个扛大活的，经营了一百五十四亩多地，拴了一辆车，还饲养了两匹马、一头驴，一般年成每年都打三十五石多粮。他家如果不剥削雇工，每年那能打这么多粮食！这样的人家，难道不是富农而是“中农”吗？这家富农还用马工换人工，用自己的畜力和农具开“牛犋铺”、出车跑脚等办法进行剥削。他又靠这些余粮、余钱向穷哥们放粮、放钱，进行高利盘剥。而我家祖辈三代给地主、富农扛大活，却一直吃不饱，穿不暖。我父亲一件棉袄穿了十二年，直到死也没离身。我有一个弟弟在十四岁时就饿死了。
    很明显，刘少奇发展中农是假，发展富农是真。他自己也早就不打自招地说过：“雇工，单干，应该放任自流”，“流出点富农来好”。他甚至拚命叫喊：“保存富农经济的政策”，“是一种长期的政策”。这就赤裸裸地表明了大叛徒刘少奇鼓吹“三马一犁一车”式的“农户”，根本不是要走社会主义道路，而是要走资本主义道路。
    至于刘少奇说什么：“三马一犁一车的农户，在数年后应发展到百分之八十”，这纯粹是骗人的鬼话。我给富农扛过大活，富农的贪财心瞒不过我。一个富农今天有了三匹马，明天就想弄到四匹五匹，乃至更多。结果是财产越来越集中到少数地主、富农手里，而绝大多数贫下中农却越来越穷。由于刘少奇在我们市的代理人极力鼓吹发展富农经济，宣扬什么“要发家，就拴车买马”等等，我们村就出现了严重的两极分化。全村一百九十户贫下中农，有十二户卖掉了土地或房屋，十户给人家扛活，十五户套上了债务的枷锁，而放债买地的大都是“三马一犁一车”的新式富农。我们贫下中农又面临走回头路的危险。走单干的道路，哪里会是什么“百分之八十”农民有“三匹马，一副犁，一挂车”，而只可能是有百分之八十甚至更多的穷哥们倾家荡产；哪里会是什么“才好搞集体农庄”，而是肯定出现新的富农和地主庄园！是毛主席他老人家及时地为我们指明了走合作化的道路，才刹住了这股歪风。
    事实充分证明，刘少奇的“三马一犁一车”是彻头彻尾的复辟资本主义的邪马贼车，刘少奇就是这个贼车上的黑驭手。其险恶用心就是妄图把社会主义中国拉回到黑暗的旧社会。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。我们贫下中农坚决听毛主席的话，世世代代跟毛主席走社会主义道路。我们坚决响应党的扩大的八届十二中全会的伟大战斗号召，决不忘记两条路线斗争的历史，把刘少奇及其“三马一犁一车”统统扫进历史的垃圾堆。
