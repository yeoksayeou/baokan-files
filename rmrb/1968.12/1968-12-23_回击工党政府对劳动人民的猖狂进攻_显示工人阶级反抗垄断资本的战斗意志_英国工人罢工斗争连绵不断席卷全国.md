In 1968, amidst the burgeoning revolutionary movements of the people worldwide, the British working class launched a new wave of struggles against monopoly capital. This wave emerged as class oppression in Britain intensified and the Labor Party government, acting as an agent of monopoly capital, revealed its vicious nature. The primary target of these struggles was the Labor Party government's series of reactionary policies against the working class and the broad masses of laboring people, dealing a heavy blow to the crisis-ridden British imperialism.

In 1968, the financial and economic crisis of British imperialism further deteriorated. To alleviate the crisis, the Labor Party government adopted the tactic of intensifying its attacks on the broad masses of people. On one hand, it continuously increased taxes and raised prices; on the other hand, it continued to restrict wage increases and forced workers to increase their labor intensity. Simultaneously, it expanded the ranks of the unemployed to strengthen the exploitation of employed workers. In just one year, the Labor Party government increased various oppressive taxes by more than 1.1 billion pounds, and the prices of thousands of items rose in succession. Even based on the official figures, which are often significantly reduced, the number of unemployed in Britain remained above 500,000 throughout the year, a figure rarely seen since the end of World War II. In regions like Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, the unemployment rate reached 6-7% of the labor force.

The Labor Party government's brazen assault on the working people met with a powerful counterattack from the working class. Since the beginning of the year, waves of strikes and work stoppages have surged across various industries and regions in Britain, showing no signs of abating. On May 15, a nationwide 24-hour strike by 3 million mechanical workers, the nationwide work stoppage by railway workers from late June to early July, and a series of strikes in the automobile industry starting in August, all dealt significant blows to the Labor Party government and monopoly capital. Additionally, workers in public transportation, civil aviation, docks, printing, television, and other sectors also conducted a series of strikes.

According to official British announcements, in the first ten months of this year, British monopoly capital enterprises lost nearly 4.2 million workdays due to strikes, the highest figure since 1962.

The automobile industry, which holds a crucial position in Britain's exports, was the hardest hit by the strikes. According to one of Britain's five major automobile companies, Ford Motor Company, the company's production was affected by strikes for all but 31 days in the first eight months of the year. By September, the entire British automobile industry had lost foreign orders worth 60 million pounds due to strike impacts.

A notable aspect of the strikes in Britain this year is the increasing number of workers who have bypassed the yellow union leaders, who are used by the Labor Party government to control the workers' movement, and have taken spontaneous strike actions. Reports indicate that currently, 90% of the strikes in Britain are of this nature. After the strikes broke out, more and more workers have ignored the yellow union leaders' orders to return to work and continued their struggles.

Another feature of this year's strike struggles is that female workers have begun to take the stage independently. Britain has 9 million female workers, accounting for about one-third of the total workforce. They suffer even more severe oppression and exploitation compared to male workers, with wages typically one-third to one-half lower than those of male workers in the same occupations, and in some cases, even lower. For a long time, due to the obstruction and sabotage by yellow union leaders, the struggle for equal pay has remained merely a theoretical discussion. However, this year, female workers in many factories have taken action on their own. For example, in June, female seamstresses at Ford Motor Company's Dagenham factory, with the broad sympathy and support of male and female workers in Britain, went on strike and finally forced the capitalists to agree to raise their wages.

The development of the workers' struggles in Britain has made the ruling class anxious. Currently, the Labor Party government is drafting a new bill to "reorganize" the unions, attempting to further utilize yellow union leaders and repressive tools to sabotage and suppress strikes. However, all these measures will inevitably provoke broader and more intense resistance from the British working class, resulting in "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet," accelerating the decay and demise of the rotten British imperialism.

    回击工党政府对劳动人民的猖狂进攻　显示工人阶级反抗垄断资本的战斗意志
    英国工人罢工斗争连绵不断席卷全国
    今年头十个月英垄断企业因罢工损失的工作日达四百二十万个，为一九六二年来最高纪录，给危机深重的英帝国主义以沉重打击
    据新华社伦敦二十二日电　在世界各国人民革命运动蓬勃发展的一九六八年里，英国工人阶级掀起了反对垄断资本的斗争新高潮。这一高潮，是在英国国内的阶级压迫日益加剧、工党政府作为垄断资本代理人的凶恶面目进一步暴露的时候形成的，斗争的主要矛头直指工党政府一系列反对工人阶级和广大劳动人民的反动政策，使危机深重的英帝国主义受到沉重的打击。
    在一九六八年中，英帝国主义的财政经济危机进一步恶化。为了缓和危机，工党政府采取了变本加厉地向广大人民开刀的办法，一面不断大量增税，抬高物价；一面继续限制工资的增加，强迫工人提高劳动强度；同时又继续扩大失业队伍，以利于加强对在业工人的剥削。仅在今年一年里，工党政府增加的各种苛捐杂税就达十一亿英镑以上，几千种物品的价格都相继上涨。即使根据经常是大大缩小了的官方数字，英国今年的失业人数一直保持在五十万以上，这是第二次世界大战以后少有的。在北爱尔兰、苏格兰和威尔士等地，失业人数已占劳动力的百分之六、七。
    工党政府向劳动人民的猖狂进攻，遭到工人阶级有力的回击。今年以来，英国全国各地、各行业工人罢工和怠工斗争的浪潮此伏彼起，连绵不绝。今年五月十五日全国三百万机械工人的二十四小时总罢工，六月底到七月初铁路工人的全国性怠工运动，从八月开始的汽车工业中的一系列罢工，都给工党政府和垄断资本以巨大的打击。此外，公共交通、民用航空、码头、印刷、电视等部门的工人，也举行了一系列罢工。
    据英国官方宣布，今年头十个月，英国垄断资本的企业就因罢工而损失了近四百二十万个工作日，达到一九六二年以来的最高纪录。
    受罢工打击最重的，是在英国出口中占有重要地位的汽车工业。据英国五大汽车公司之一的福特汽车公司宣布，这个公司的生产，在今年头八个月里只有三十一天没有受到罢工的影响。到九月份为止，整个英国汽车工业就因罢工影响而丧失了外国订货合六千万镑。
    在今年英国的罢工斗争中，特别值得注意的是：越来越多的工人踢开了工党政府用来控制工人运动的黄色工会头子，自发地举行罢工。据报道，目前英国的罢工有百分之九十都是这样的罢工。罢工爆发后，也有越来越多的工人不理睬黄色工会头子硬要他们复工的命令，而继续坚持斗争。
    今年罢工斗争的另一特点是：女工开始单独登上了斗争舞台。英国现有妇女职工九百万，约占职工总数的三分之一。她们比男工受着更加深重的压迫和剥削，工资通常比同工种的男工要低三分之一到二分之一，有的甚至低得更多。长期来，由于黄色工会头子的阻挠破坏，争取同工同酬的斗争始终只是纸上谈兵。但是，今年许多工厂的女工自己行动起来了。例如福特汽车公司戴根纳姆工厂的女缝纫工在英国男女工人的广泛同情和支持下，今年六月间举行了罢工，终于迫使资本家不得不同意给她们增加工资。
    英国工人斗争的发展，使统治集团感到惶惶不安。目前，工党政府正在拟订所谓改组工会的新法案，企图进一步利用黄色工会头子和专政工具来破坏和镇压罢工。但是，这一切作法必然会激起英国工人阶级更加广泛、更加猛烈的反抗，其结果将是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，使腐朽衰败的英帝国主义加速灭亡。
