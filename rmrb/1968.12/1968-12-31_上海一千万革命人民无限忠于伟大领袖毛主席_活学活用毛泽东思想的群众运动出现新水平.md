The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has propelled the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in Shanghai to a new level. Looking at the revolutionary situation in Shanghai, it has never been so inspiring. The unprecedented spread and popularization of Mao Zedong Thought have continuously raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of Shanghai's ten million revolutionary people, fundamentally changing their spiritual outlook. Under the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are increasingly full of vigor and vitality, their fighting spirit soaring. They closely unite around the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, advancing bravely along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

Shanghai's ten million revolutionary people are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become the primary need of life for the broad revolutionary people of Shanghai. Since this year, various factories, people's communes, schools, as well as many shops and alleys, have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, the broad revolutionary masses, with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, repeatedly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with problems from revolutionary struggles, their revolutionary fighting spirit growing ever stronger. In a family study class at a common steelworker's home in the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, from the elderly with white hair to the children with baby teeth, four generations sit in front of the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles," promoting the revolutionization of thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Songjiang County's Xinhang Commune, in the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, enthusiastically praised the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, discussed the history of the two-line struggle in their commune, thereby universally raising their two-line struggle consciousness, determined to seize the opportunity to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside even better. Under the leadership of the workers' and soldiers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, colleges and universities, middle and primary schools, as well as the news, publishing, and cultural systems in various fields of the superstructure, have universally set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting the in-depth development of struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the alleys, many retired old workers voluntarily act as tutors, leading the revolutionary masses in the alleys to study Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, greatly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary residents.

For every new instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao, for every battle order from the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the broad revolutionary people of Shanghai act immediately, closely follow, study earnestly, and implement resolutely. This is the most outstanding feature of Shanghai's broad revolutionary people studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They say, Chairman Mao's new instructions are the guiding light for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The closer one follows and the deeper one studies Chairman Mao's instructions, the clearer the direction and the greater the strength, one can always advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, after each new instruction from Chairman Mao is issued, from the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, district and county revolutionary committees, to factories, people's communes, and various grassroots units, learning is immediately organized, and implementation is carried out swiftly. The broad revolutionary masses use Chairman Mao's new instructions to compare with the actual struggle of their units, summarize work, find gaps, and quickly implement with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." After Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture only a few people; it should be known to the broad revolutionary masses," many factories, people's communes, schools, shops, and alleys universally set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, combining the more than two years of struggle practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply studying the history of the two-line struggle, greatly raising the revolutionary masses' awareness of resolutely executing and bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, promoting the progress of various works.

In the struggle, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is another prominent feature of Shanghai's broad revolutionary people. Since this year, the revolutionary criticism and struggle on various fronts in Shanghai have been carried out vigorously and solidly. The broad revolutionary masses, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. Workers from many units such as Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, Shanghai Valve No. 1 Plant, Shanghai Port No. 7 District, Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and China Clock Factory, study Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle"; study Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building theory, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of joining the party to become an official," "theory of taming tools," and "theory of the backwardness of the masses"; study the "Anshan Constitution" personally annotated by Chairman Mao, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "profit-first," "material incentives," and "expert management," cleansing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist poison in various aspects. The revolutionary criticism and struggle in many people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai are carried out with great fervor. Every day before going to work, a brief field criticism meeting is held to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods that Liu Shaoqi promoted in the countryside, such as "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms," making them stink to high heaven. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants love the invincible Mao Zedong Thought even more, their awareness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works becoming higher and higher.

The third feature of Shanghai's broad revolutionary people studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is breaking the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public" in the process of learning, promoting the revolutionization of thought even better. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." The broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary people follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, using the "Old Three Articles" as a motto, taking Zhang Side, White Agnes, and Old Foolish Man as shining examples, promoting the revolutionization of thought, establishing the noble quality of eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao and selflessness. They say, the deeper the struggle against selfishness, the closer to Chairman Mao; the fiercer the struggle against selfishness, the tighter the follow to Chairman Mao. Selflessness is the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Under the great encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Shanghai's ten million revolutionary people are determined to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, achieve even greater successes, and welcome the victorious convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

    上海一千万革命人民无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席
    活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现新水平
    新华社上海三十日电　无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，推动上海活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断发展，提高到一个崭新的水平。纵观上海的革命形势，从来没有象现在这样令人振奋。毛泽东思想的空前大传播、大普及，使上海一千万革命人民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，精神面貌发生了深刻变化。在毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光照耀下，广大工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，越来越朝气蓬勃，斗志昂扬。他们紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。
    上海一千万革命人民无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。活学活用毛泽东思想，已经成为上海市广大革命人民生活的第一需要。今年以来，各个工厂、人民公社、学校，以及许多商店和里弄，都办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班上，广大革命群众怀着对毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，带着革命斗争中的问题反复活学活用毛泽东思想，革命斗志越来越昂扬。在上钢三厂一个普通炼钢工人的家庭学习班里，从头发花白的老人到乳牙未换的孩子，一家四代坐在伟大领袖毛主席像前，活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，促进思想革命化。松江县新浜公社贫下中农在活学活用毛主席著作的过程中，热烈赞颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，大议本公社两条路线斗争的历史，从而普遍提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，决心抓紧时机，把农村的无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。在工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，大专院校、中小学，以及新闻、出版和文化系统等上层建筑各个领域，也普遍开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大力活学活用毛主席著作，推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。在街道里弄，许多退休老工人主动当辅导员，带动里弄革命群众学习毛主席一系列最新指示，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，大大提高了革命居民们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    对伟大领袖毛主席的每一项最新指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，闻风而动，紧紧跟上，认真学习，坚决贯彻，这是上海广大革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想的最突出的特点。他们说，毛主席的最新指示是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯。对毛主席的指示跟得越紧，学得越深，就方向越明，力量越大，就能始终沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。因此，毛主席的每一项最新指示下达后，从上海市革命委员会、各区和县革委会一直到工厂、人民公社和各个基层单位，都立即组织学习，迅速贯彻执行。广大革命群众以毛主席的最新指示对照本单位的斗争实际，总结工作，找出差距，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神迅速落实。毛主席
  “历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表后，许多工厂、人民公社、学校、商店和街道里弄，普遍办起毛泽东思想学习班，结合两年多无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，深入学习两条路线斗争史，极大地提高了革命群众坚决执行和勇敢捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性，推动了各项工作的进展。
    在斗争中活学活用，这是上海广大革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想的又一个显著特点。今年以来，上海各条战线上的革命大批判开展得轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实。广大革命群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，活学活用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。上海国棉十七厂、上海阀门一厂、上海港七区、上钢一厂、上钢二厂、上钢三厂、中国钟厂等许多单位的工人，大学毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；大学毛主席的无产阶级建党理论，狠批刘少奇的“入党做官论”、“驯服工具论”、“群众落后论”；大学毛主席亲自批示的“鞍钢宪法”，狠批刘少奇的“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“专家治厂”，从各个方面肃清刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义毒素。上海郊区许多人民公社的革命大批判开展得热火朝天，社员每天出工时，都要开一次简短的田头批判会，把刘少奇在农村推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货，批得臭不可闻。通过革命大批判，广大贫下中农更加热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想，活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性越来越高。
    上海广大革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想的第三个特点，是在学习中大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，更好地促进思想革命化。伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。广大工人、贫下中农和革命群众遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在学习中以“老三篇”为座右铭，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为光辉榜样，促进思想革命化，树立永远忠于毛主席和一心为公的高贵品质。他们说，斗私越深，对毛主席越亲；斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧。一心为公，是对毛主席最大的忠。
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，上海一千万革命人民决心更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，创造出更优异的成绩，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的胜利召开。
