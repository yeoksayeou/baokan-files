The world revolution has entered a great new era. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The world revolution has entered a great new era." The developments in the international situation over the past year have completely proven the correctness and wisdom of Chairman Mao's scientific judgment. The revolutionary movements of the people of all countries are thriving.

1968 was a year in which the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries around the world flourished.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved decisive victories. The people of Albania are advancing bravely on the road to victory. In the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which shocked the world, has achieved great and decisive victories, and its influence on the international situation is becoming increasingly great and far-reaching. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is spreading more widely throughout the world. Our country has successfully detonated another hydrogen bomb and conducted a new thermonuclear test. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and another fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, the people of Albania continue to deepen the revolutionization movement, achieving new brilliant achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America continue to advance. The flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning more fiercely. In Europe, North America, and Oceania, the revolutionary mass movements are surging and unceasing. These two great currents of revolutionary struggle, merging together, are striking heavier and heavier blows at the old world. The true Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in the capitalist countries have been tempered and grown stronger in the struggle. In countries where modern revisionists have seized power, the revolutionary people are also rising up to resist the rule of the revisionist cliques. Looking at the world, the clouds and waters are surging, and the winds and thunder are roaring. The revolutionary situation is excellent.

The national democratic revolution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is deepening. The flames of people's armed struggle are burning fiercely. Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the main regions where the world revolutionary storm directly strikes imperialism. In the past year, in this vast area, people's armed struggles have seen new developments. The Vietnamese people have achieved great victories on the battlefield, driving the American aggressors into a state of panic and desperation. The patriotic military and civilians in Laos have annihilated a large number of the enemy's forces and expanded the liberated areas. Throughout Southeast Asia, people's armed struggles are blossoming everywhere. The people's armed forces in Thailand and Burma have grown stronger in the struggle against "encirclement and suppression." The people's armed struggles in Indonesia, Malaya, and the Philippines continue to report victories. In the Middle East, the Arab people have taken up arms to fight against the aggression of American imperialism and its lackey Israel, and the brave and skillful Palestinian guerrillas have struck fear into the hearts of the enemy. In Africa, the revolutionary people of Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Mozambique, and the Congo (Kinshasa) have overcome various difficulties and continued to persist in armed struggle, and some regions have seen significant developments. The people of Zimbabwe have opened a new front of armed struggle to resist the colonial rule of Southern Rhodesia. In Latin America, the people's armed forces in some countries are also persisting in the struggle. The flames of people's armed struggle are burning fiercely on the lands of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which is the main sign of the deepening of the national democratic revolutionary movement.

In the past year, in some countries in Asia and Latin America, people's movements have also seen new developments. The Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle is advancing wave after wave, striking a powerful blow at the Japanese and American reactionaries; the Japanese students' movement against the corrupt educational system and fascist suppression is surging. In Latin America, the student movements and workers' and peasants' struggles in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Peru are merging into a new storm that is increasingly powerful against American imperialism and dictatorial rule.

A great storm of revolutionary mass movements has risen fiercely in Europe and North America, the heartland of imperialism. This is a major development in the world revolutionary situation. This spring, the flames of the American black people's struggle against violence spread to more than a hundred cities, showing the extremely powerful revolutionary force hidden among the more than twenty million black people in the United States. Our great leader Chairman Mao issued a statement on April 16 supporting the American black people's struggle against violence, pointing out that the struggle of the American black people is "a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited people of the United States against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class." This statement of great historical significance has greatly encouraged the struggles of the American people and the people of other capitalist countries. In May, a great storm of revolutionary mass struggles erupted in France and other countries in Western Europe and North America, the scale of which was unprecedented in this region in decades. Tens of millions of workers, students, peasants, and other strata of the people have launched heroic struggles, opposing the reactionary rule of the monopoly capitalist class, aiming at the rotten capitalist system, and striking a fierce blow at the international monopoly capitalist class. This storm of revolutionary mass movements continues to develop. Recently, in countries such as France, Italy, West Germany, Britain, Spain, and the United States, the struggles of the people have surged again. This shows that the people's movements in Europe and North America are unstoppable by any force.

The people of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries are becoming increasingly aware and are advancing with the torch of revolution against the rule of modern revisionism. The struggle of the people of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries against the reactionary rule of the modern revisionist cliques has seen significant developments this year. It is an important part of the contemporary world people's revolutionary movement. Following the active role of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique as the international "fire brigade," it has found that the volcano under its feet is beginning to smoke. Class struggle in the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly sharp. The revolutionary leaflets of the "Stalin Group" are like a bright torch cutting through the dark sky of the Soviet Union, calling on the Soviet people to fight to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat. In Poland, the revolutionary Polish Communist Party is leading the people to actively fight against modern revisionism. In Czechoslovakia, the oppressed and enslaved people are rising up to resist the aggression of Soviet social-imperialism and the rule of the Czech revisionist traitor clique. All of this shows the new awakening of the people under the rule of the modern revisionist cliques, indicating that the modern revisionists, led by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, like imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, will inevitably be swallowed by the revolutionary torrent of the world people. The imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary forces are in trouble both internally and externally, at their wits' end.

The past year was a year of accelerating decline for the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and the reactionaries of all countries. They are full of contradictions, disintegrating, in trouble both internally and externally, at their wits' end, and increasingly isolated.

The capitalist world is full of crises and contradictions, and the imperialist system is accelerating towards comprehensive collapse. Over the past year, the days of American imperialism have been very difficult. The heavy losses suffered by the U.S. in the Vietnam War and the setbacks to its aggressive policies have greatly deepened its political and economic crises. Class contradictions in the United States are becoming increasingly sharp. Contradictions within the American ruling class are becoming increasingly intense. The rule of the American monopoly capitalist class is becoming increasingly unstable. This spring, the most serious financial crisis in the capitalist world in forty years erupted, and the dollar, which was already in a precarious situation, was on the verge of collapse, and its position as an "international currency" was fundamentally shaken. In November, the storm of capitalists around the world buying gold resumed, and the dollar was once again hit hard. The hegemony of American imperialism in the capitalist world is crumbling. It is precisely in this state of panic that the American monopoly capitalist group, in the U.S. presidential "election" held this year, helplessly brought out another of its puppets, the Republican Party, to replace the Democratic Party, which had been in power for eight consecutive years. This farce of changing horses in midstream is a manifestation of the desperate situation of American imperialism.

The situation of other imperialist countries is also very bad. The economic situation in these countries has generally deteriorated, industrial production has stagnated, the number of unemployed has increased, and the crisis clouds are thick. They have been repeatedly hit by financial crisis storms, and the positions of the pound, franc, and other currencies have become increasingly fragile, and the entire capitalist monetary system is on the verge of collapse. The monopoly capitalist classes of countries such as Britain, France, and Italy in Western Europe, in order to get out of the crisis, are stepping up the exploitation of the broad masses of laborers, further intensifying class contradictions within the country. The surge in revolutionary mass movements in these countries is also constantly dealing heavy blows to their economies.

At the same time, imperialist countries are shifting disasters to each other, engaging in fierce currency wars and trade wars, making imperialism more disintegrated. All of this indicates that the entire imperialist system is accelerating towards comprehensive collapse. The face of Soviet social-imperialism is fully exposed, and the modern revisionist clique is accelerating its disintegration.

The days of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique are also very difficult. It is pushing forward the so-called "new economic system" to fully restore capitalism at home, strengthening fascist dictatorship, and provoking increasingly strong dissatisfaction and resistance from the broad masses of people. Abroad, its counter-revolutionary collusion with American imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries is becoming increasingly rampant and blatant, putting itself in a position of enmity with the people of the whole world, making itself increasingly isolated. In particular, the Soviet revisionists' armed invasion of Czechoslovakia in August this year and their insistence on long-term military occupation of Czechoslovakia have fully exposed their social-imperialist ugly face to the people of the whole world, drawing strong condemnation from the people of all countries. The Soviet revisionists' arrogant and bullying acts of aggression have also intensified the disintegration of the modern revisionist clique. Modern revisionists are attacking each other, quarreling endlessly. The counter-revolutionary black meeting originally scheduled for this November also had to be postponed. Modern revisionism has declared bankruptcy.

The situation of the reactionaries of all countries that rely on the United States and the Soviet Union is even worse. From Indira Gandhi of India, Suharto of Indonesia, and the "Malaysian" Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew to Mobutu of the Congo (Kinshasa) and Costa e Silva of Brazil, all these reactionaries are on the brink of collapse, living from day to day. They are ruthlessly suppressing the people at home and selling national interests abroad, making the people impoverished and exhausted, and full of complaints, and they are increasingly unable to get by.

The facts of the past year have further proven Chairman Mao's scientific judgment: "American imperialism and all other harmful creatures have already prepared their own gravediggers, and their days of being buried will not be long." The attempt of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists to divide the world can only accelerate their doom.

In the face of the surging revolutionary movement of the people of the world, American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists collude with each other and also compete with each other, attempting to redivide the world to save their doom. This new international phenomenon has become clearer from the facts of this year.

The two big bullies, American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, are at their wits' end and are making desperate struggles. They collude with each other to intensify aggression and jointly suppress the people of various countries. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's brazen invasion of Czechoslovakia is a prominent manifestation of the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union in an attempt to redraw the sphere of influence. Everyone has seen that before the Soviet revisionists sent troops, they first informed Washington; after the Soviet revisionists sent troops, the U.S. immediately stated that it would not "retaliate," but emphasized that the U.S. and the Soviet Union could continue to "seek understanding" on the Vietnam issue and other issues. Indeed, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has further served the U.S. on the Vietnam issue, making global deals with the U.S. In short, the U.S.'s aggression against Vietnam has received the tacit approval and support of the Soviet revisionists, while the Soviet revisionists' open invasion of Czechoslovakia has also received the tacit approval and support of the U.S. The two number one imperialists' conspiracy to redivide the world is now clear to all.

The evil plot of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists does not indicate their strength but their weakness. Under the impact of the great storm of the world people's revolutionary movement, both the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are surrounded by enemies and can hardly protect themselves. Therefore, the Soviet revisionists need to rely on the U.S. more, and the U.S. also needs to use the Soviet revisionists more, and they will inevitably collude with each other more closely; at the same time, the alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists is completely a robbers' alliance, and they cannot avoid competing with each other. This situation reflects the desperate situation and last-ditch struggle of the two imperialist robbers, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists.

A new high tide of the great struggle against American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists is about to come. The pipe dream of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists to divide the world will inevitably be shattered. Our great leader Chairman Mao often teaches us: Revolutionary parties and revolutionary people always have to go through education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to be tempered and mature, and to have the guarantee of victory.

American imperialism is an indispensable negative teacher for the people of the world, and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is the same. Their savage acts of aggression have educated the masses of people from the negative side, greatly promoting the awakening of the oppressed people within the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, and are now stirring up a new great high tide of struggle against American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists by the proletariat and the broad masses of people around the world. All the people oppressed by American imperialism, the Soviet revisionists, and their lackeys will further unite, form a broad united front, and launch fierce and sustained attacks on their common enemies. The attempt of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists to collude and redivide the world is just a pipe dream, and the result can only be to accelerate their doom. The wheel of historical progress will not turn back.

More than 90% of the population will always be revolutionary. The desperate struggles of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries will only accelerate their own doom. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The road of revolution, like the path of all activities in the world, is always tortuous, not straight."

American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. Especially when this small clique of harmful creatures is in trouble both internally and externally and is heading towards final collapse, they will definitely use military adventurism and political deception, the two counter-revolutionary tactics, to resist to the utmost; they will definitely gather some political garbage and patch together an anti-China, counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" to fight to the death. This is a necessary phenomenon in the international class struggle.

The development of history, the development of revolution, although it has twists and turns, ups and downs, although there will be people who waver, compromise, and surrender in the revolutionary ranks, the more than 90% of the population will always be revolutionary, will always support Marxism-Leninism, the revolutionary torrent will always be endless, will always be unstoppable. All reactionaries are doomed to perish, only the time will be earlier or later. As pointed out in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party: "Undoubtedly, the wheel of historical progress will not turn back, imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionary forces will inevitably be thoroughly smashed by the revolutionary people, and all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations in the world will certainly achieve thorough emancipation in their struggles!"

The great teacher of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "From now on, in the next fifty to one hundred years, it will be a great era of thorough change in the social system of the world, an era of great upheaval, an era that cannot be compared with any other historical era."

The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought adhere to the principle of proletarian internationalism, resolutely unite with all the true Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in the world, unite with all the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations in the world, support each other, learn from each other, and contribute our strength to thoroughly bury American-led imperialism, Soviet-led modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries in this great era of thorough upheaval.

专栏：国际时事讲话

    世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。”一年来国际形势的发展，完全证明了毛主席这一科学论断的英明和正确。世界各国人民革命运动蓬勃发展
    一九六八年，是全世界各国人民的革命运动蓬蓬勃勃地发展的一年。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在胜利的道路上奋勇前进
    在过去一年中，震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利，在国际上产生越来越巨大和深远的影响。战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界更加广泛地传播。我国又爆炸了一颗氢弹，成功地进行了一次新的热核试验。这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕的成果。阿尔巴尼亚人民在伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志领导下，继续深入开展革命化运动，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，在反帝、反修的斗争中，取得了新的辉煌成就。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动继续向前发展，革命武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺。欧洲、北美和大洋洲的革命群众运动风起云涌，持续不断。这两股伟大的革命斗争的洪流汇合在一起，给予旧世界以日益沉重的打击。资本主义各国真正的马克思列宁主义政党和团体，在斗争中得到了锻炼，不断成长壮大。在现代修正主义者篡夺了政权的国家，革命人民也纷纷起来进行反抗修正主义集团统治的斗争。放眼世界，四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激，革命形势一片大好。
    亚非拉民族民主革命深入发展
    人民武装斗争的烈火熊熊燃烧
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，是当前直接打击帝国主义的世界革命风暴的主要地区。过去一年里，在这个广阔地带，人民武装斗争有新的发展。越南人民在战场上取得伟大胜利，把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额，走投无路。老挝爱国军民歼灭了敌人大量有生力量，扩大了解放区。在整个东南亚，人民武装斗争遍地开花。泰国和缅甸的人民武装在反“围剿”的战斗中壮大了自己的力量。印尼、马来亚、菲律宾的人民武装斗争也不断传来捷报。在西亚，阿拉伯人民也拿起了武器，为反抗美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略而战斗，英勇善战的巴勒斯坦游击队使敌人闻风丧胆。在非洲，几内亚（比绍）、安哥拉、莫三鼻给和刚果（金）的革命人民，克服种种困难，继续坚持武装斗争，有些地区并且有显著的发展。津巴布韦人民为了反对南罗得西亚的殖民统治，开辟了武装斗争的新的战线。在拉丁美洲，一些国家的人民武装也在坚持斗争。人民武装斗争的烈火在亚非拉的大地上熊熊燃烧，这是民族民主革命运动深入发展的主要标志。
    过去的一年里，在亚洲和拉丁美洲的一些国家里，人民运动也有新的发展。日本人民的反美爱国斗争，一浪接一浪地前进，有力地打击着美日反动派；日本学生反对腐朽教育制度和法西斯镇压的群众运动日益高涨。拉丁美洲的墨西哥、巴西、智利、阿根廷、乌拉圭、玻利维亚、秘鲁等国家的学生运动和工人农民斗争，正在汇合成为日益强大的反美、反独裁统治的新风暴。
    欧洲北美人民展开英勇的斗争
    革命群众运动的风暴猛烈兴起
    伟大的革命群众运动在欧洲、北美这个帝国主义心脏地区猛烈兴起，这是世界革命形势的一个重大的发展。今年春天，美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火，一下子就燃遍了一百几十个城市，显示了两千多万美国黑人中蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量。我们伟大领袖毛主席四月十六日发表了支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，指出美国黑人的斗争是“整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角”。这个具有伟大历史意义的声明，大大地鼓舞了美国人民以及其他资本主义国家人民的斗争。五月间，在法国和西欧、北美其他一些国家爆发了革命群众斗争的伟大风暴，其规模的巨大，来势的迅猛，是这个地区几十年来从未有过的。数以千万计的工人、学生、农民和其他阶层的人民群众，展开了英勇的斗争，反对垄断资产阶级的反动统治，矛头指向腐朽的资本主义制度，给了国际垄断资产阶级以猛烈的冲击。这场革命群众运动的风暴一直在持续发展。最近，在法国、意大利、西德、英国、西班牙以及美国等许多国家，人民群众的斗争又有新的高涨。这表明，欧洲、北美的人民运动是任何力量也阻挡不了的。
    苏联和一些东欧国家的人民正日益觉醒
    高举反对修正主义统治的革命火炬前进
    苏联和一些东欧国家人民反对现代修正主义集团反动统治的斗争，在今年有显著的发展。它是当代世界人民革命运动的一个重要组成部分。跟着美帝积极充当国际“灭火队”的苏修叛徒集团，已经发觉它自己脚下的火山开始冒烟了。苏联国内的阶级斗争正日益尖锐化。“斯大林小组”的革命传单，象一支明亮的火炬划破了苏联的黑暗天空，号召苏联人民为重建无产阶级专政而战斗。在波兰，革命的波兰共产党正在领导人民积极进行反对现代修正主义的斗争。在捷克斯洛伐克，受压迫、受奴役的人民愤怒起来反抗苏修社会帝国主义的侵略和捷修叛徒集团的统治。所有这些，都显示了现代修正主义集团统治下的各国人民的新觉醒，说明了以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者，同帝国主义和各国反动派一样，必将为世界人民的革命洪流所吞没。帝修反内外交困走投无路
    过去的一年，是以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者以及各国反动派加速没落的一年。他们矛盾重重，分崩离析，内外交困，走投无路，日益陷于空前的孤立。
    资本主义世界危机四伏矛盾重重
    帝国主义制度加速走向全面崩溃
    一年来，美帝国主义的日子是很不好过的。美帝在侵越战争中的惨重失败以及它的侵略政策到处受挫，大大加深了它的政治、经济危机。美国国内阶级矛盾日益尖锐。美国统治集团内部的矛盾越来越剧烈。美国垄断资产阶级的统治越来越不稳。今年春天爆发了资本主义世界四十年来最严重的金融危机，本来就岌岌可危的美元濒于垮台，作为“国际货币”的地位已根本动摇。十一月间资本主义世界抢购黄金的风暴再起，美元又一次受到了打击。美帝国主义在资本主义世界的霸权日益土崩瓦解。正是在这种焦头烂额的情况下，美国垄断资本集团在今年举行的美国总统“选举”中，无可奈何地抬出它的另一个御用工具共和党来替换连续执政八年的民主党。这种急流换马的丑剧，正是美帝国主义穷途末路的表现。
    其他帝国主义国家的处境也十分不妙。这些国家的经济情况普遍恶化，工业生产停滞，失业人数激增，危机阴云密布。它们一再遭到金融危机风暴的袭击，英镑、法郎等的地位越来越脆弱，整个资本主义货币体系已到了崩溃的边缘。英、法、意大利等西欧国家的垄断资产阶级为了摆脱危机，加紧对广大劳动人民的压榨，从而进一步加剧国内的阶级矛盾。这些国家的革命群众运动的高涨，又不断给予它们的经济以沉重的打击。
    同时，帝国主义国家之间互相转嫁灾难，展开激烈的货币战和贸易战，使得帝国主义更加分崩离析。所有这一切，都表明了整个帝国主义制度正在加速走向全面崩溃。苏修社会帝国主义面目充分暴露现代修正主义集团加速分崩离析
    苏修叛徒集团的日子同样很不好过。它在国内加紧推行全面复辟资本主义的所谓“新经济体制”，加强法西斯专政，激起广大人民越来越强烈的不满和反抗。它在国外同美帝国主义和各国反动派的反革命勾结越来越猖狂，越来越露骨，把自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，因而使自己越来越陷于孤立。特别是苏修在今年八月对捷克斯洛伐克发动武装侵略，并且坚持对捷克斯洛伐克的长期军事占领，这就把它的社会帝国主义的狰狞面目彻头彻尾地暴露在全世界人民的面前，遭到了各国人民的强烈谴责。苏修的这种横行霸道的侵略行径，也加剧了现代修正主义集团的分崩离析。现代修正主义者互相攻讦，吵闹不休。原订在今年十一月召开的反革命黑会，也不得不宣告延期。现代修正主义已宣告了总破产。
    各国反动派投靠美帝苏修祸国殃民
    它们的反动统治摇摇欲坠朝不保夕
    美帝苏修是这样，投靠这两家的各国反动派的景况就当然更是糟糕。从印度的英迪拉·甘地、印尼的苏哈托、“马来西亚”的拉赫曼和李光耀到刚果（金）的蒙博托、巴西的科斯塔—席尔瓦，所有这些反动派没有一个不是摇摇欲坠，朝不保夕。它们对内疯狂镇压人民，对外出卖民族利益，弄得民穷财尽，怨声载道，越来越混不下去。
    一年来的事实进一步证明了毛主席的科学论断：“美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”美帝苏修妄图瓜分世界只能加速灭亡
    在世界人民革命运动汹涌澎湃的洪流面前，美帝苏修互相勾结，又互相争夺，妄图重新瓜分世界，来挽救它们的灭亡。这种国际新现象，从今年的事实中看得更清楚了。
    美帝苏修两大恶霸日暮途穷垂死挣扎
    相互勾结加紧侵略合伙镇压各国人民
    苏修叛徒集团悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，就是美苏勾结妄图重新划分势力范围的一个突出的表现。人们都看到，在苏修出兵之前，它先向华盛顿打了招呼；在苏修出兵之后，美帝则马上表示不准备“进行报复”，而强调美苏两家可以在越南问题和其他问题上继续“谋求谅解”。果然，苏修叛徒集团就在越南问题上进一步地为美帝效劳，同美帝大做全球性交易。总之，美帝对越南进行的侵略战争，得到了苏修的默契和支持，而苏修公开出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，也得到了美帝的默契和支持。这两个头号的帝国主义互相勾结妄图重新瓜分世界的大阴谋，已是昭然若揭。
    美帝苏修的这种罪恶的图谋，并不说明它们的强大，而是说明它们的虚弱。在世界人民革命运动的巨大风暴冲击之下，美帝苏修都是四面楚歌，自身难保。因此，苏修更加需要投靠美帝，美帝也更加需要利用苏修，它们必然要加紧互相勾结；同时，美帝苏修的联盟完全是强盗的联盟，它们又不可避免地要互相争夺。这种情况正是反映了美帝苏修这两个帝国主义强盗的日暮途穷和垂死挣扎。
    反对美帝苏修的伟大斗争新高潮将要来到
    美帝苏修瓜分世界的黄粱美梦必然要破灭
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席经常教导我们：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。
    美帝国主义是世界人民不可缺少的反面教员，苏修叛徒集团也是一样。它们的野蛮侵略行动，从反面教育了人民群众，大大地促进了美帝和苏修国内被压迫人民的觉悟，同时正在激起全世界无产阶级和广大人民反对美帝和苏修的新的伟大斗争的高潮。一切遭受美帝苏修以及它们的走狗所压迫的人民，必将进一步团结起来，结成广泛的统一战线，向他们的共同敌人发动猛烈的持久的进攻。美帝苏修互相勾结妄图重新瓜分世界，不过是一场黄粱美梦，其结果只能是加速它们的灭亡。历史前进的车轮是不会倒转的
    占人口百分之九十以上的人民总是要革命的
    帝修反的垂死挣扎只能加速它们自己的灭亡
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的道路，同世界上一切事物活动的道路一样，总是曲折的，不是笔直的。”
    美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派是绝不会自动退出历史舞台的。尤其是在这一小撮害人虫陷于内外交困、走向最后崩溃的时候，它们一定要使用军事冒险和政治欺骗的反革命两手，作最大限度的抵抗；它们一定要搜罗一些政治上的垃圾，拼凑反华、反革命的“神圣同盟”，作拚死的斗争。这是国际阶级斗争的必然现象。
    历史的发展，革命的发展，虽然有曲折，有起伏，虽然革命队伍中会有人动摇，有人妥协，有人投降，但是，占人口百分之九十以上的人民总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的，革命的洪流总是无穷无尽的，总是阻挡不住的。一切反动派都是注定要灭亡的，只是时间上有先有后而已。正如我党八届扩大的十二中全会公报所指出的：“毫无疑问，历史前进的车轮是不会倒转的，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动势力必然要被革命人民彻底粉碎，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族，都必将在自己的斗争中得到彻底翻身！”
    中国人民坚持无产阶级国际主义的原则
    同各国革命人民团结在一起胜利在一起
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：“从现在起，五十年内外到一百年内外，是世界上社会制度彻底变化的伟大时代，是一个翻天覆地的时代，是过去任何一个历史时代都不能比拟的。”
    用马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚持实行无产阶级国际主义原则，坚决同全世界真正的马克思列宁主义政党、团体团结在一起，同全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族团结在一起，互相支持，互相学习，为在这样一个翻天覆地的伟大时代里，彻底埋葬以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派而贡献自己的力量。
