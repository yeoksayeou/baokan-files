	New York, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) - Some progressive students at New York University in the United States held a demonstration on the evening of the 4th, strongly protesting against the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam. They rushed into the student center of this university and drove away the observer from the South Vietnamese puppet group stationed at the United Nations who was about to give a "speech" there.

	The U.S. reactionary ruling clique, in order to boost the status of the South Vietnamese puppet group, arranged for the observer from the South Vietnamese puppet group stationed at the United Nations to give a "speech" at New York University. However, just as this running dog of U.S. imperialism was about to start his speech, a large group of progressive students rushed in after holding a demonstration to protest against the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam. The students tore down the tattered flag of the South Vietnamese puppet group hanging on the podium, replaced it with the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and distributed a large number of leaflets opposing the U.S. invasion of Vietnam. They also jumped onto the podium, poured a pot of water over the head and face of this running dog of U.S. imperialism, draped a Nazi fascist flag over him, and threw rotten eggs at him. Under the impact of the students, this running dog of U.S. imperialism was in a state of utter disarray, hurriedly rolled off the podium, and fled the university.

	These progressive students then rushed into another lecture hall and drove away the executive editor of The New York Times, Reston, who was there to polish the image of the newly elected Nixon administration, and tore up his speech into pieces.

    南越傀儡装模作样发表“演讲”
    美国学生泼冷水扔臭蛋怒逐走狗
    新华社五日讯　纽约消息：美国纽约市纽约大学的一些进步学生，四日晚举行示威，强烈抗议美国侵略越南的政策，并且冲进这个学校的学生中心，把正在这里“演讲”的南越傀儡集团驻联合国的观察员从讲台上赶了下去。
    美国反动统治集团为了提高南越傀儡集团的身价，把南越傀儡集团驻联合国的观察员弄到纽约大学去作“演讲”。可是当这个美帝走狗刚刚要开讲的时候，一大批进步学生在举行了抗议美国侵越政策的示威后冲了进去。学生们把讲台上挂的南越傀儡集团的破旗扯了下来，挂起了越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，散发了大量反对美国侵略越南的传单。他们还跳上了讲台，拿起一壶水泼得这个美帝走狗满头满脸，然后把一面纳粹法西斯旗帜蒙在他的身上，并向这个美帝走狗扔臭鸡蛋。在学生们的冲击下，这个美帝走狗狼狈万状，慌忙滚下讲台，溜出了这个大学。
    这批进步学生接着又冲进了另一个讲堂，把在那里为新当选的尼克松政府涂脂抹粉的纽约时报执行主编赖斯顿也赶下了讲台，并把他的讲稿撕得粉碎。
