Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, the revolutionary people of all nationalities are determined to carry out the three revolutionary tasks (struggle, criticism, and transformation) and seize complete victory in the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary committees in all prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties in Yunnan have been fully established. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 16th: Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and in the implementation of the great battle tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and under the impetus of the mass movement of studying the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, revolutionary committees have been established in all 13 prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities, and 128 counties in Yunnan Province. Revolutionary committees have also been established in almost all industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes in the province. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

On December 16th, in the spring city of Kunming on the southwestern border of the motherland, 300,000 military and civilian personnel held a grand rally to celebrate the province's achievement of being fully red. On the same day, grand celebration rallies were held in all prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities across the province. At the grand rally held in Yunnan Province and Kunming City, leaders of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees and the Kunming garrison of the People's Liberation Army delivered speeches. They called on the military and civilian personnel of the entire province to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to deepen the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, to further launch a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to fully implement the various battle tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.

After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee immediately led the revolutionary masses of all nationalities in the province to launch a mass movement to study, publicize, and implement the communiqué throughout the province. The revolutionary people of all nationalities in the province, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; the broad revolutionary masses should know about it," took Chairman Mao's brilliant report at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee as a textbook, and extensively and deeply studied the history of the two-line struggle within the Party. Many prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties in the province also specially organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the main content of studying the history of the two-line struggle within the Party and implementing the various battle tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. Through study, the revolutionary people of all nationalities in the province greatly enhanced their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, further raised their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and thus greatly accelerated the pace of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, making revolutionary committees appear in succession. In the five border counties of Longchuan, Ruili, Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianghe, and the border town of Tengchong in the Baoshan Prefecture, due to the sabotage of a handful of class enemies, revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination could not be achieved for a long time. Under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and the impetus of studying the history of the two-line struggle, the revolutionary masses of all nationalities in these five counties and one town quickly raised their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, exposed the tricks of the class enemies, quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and established revolutionary committees.

Located on the southwestern border of the motherland, Yunnan is on the front line of fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and the class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. After liberation, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, along with his wife, had entered and exited Yunnan three times, closely colluding with his agents in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin, to surrender and betray, and to conspire together, implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in Yunnan, attempting to turn Yunnan into their base for restoring capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary masses of all nationalities in Yunnan Province, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fought tenaciously against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin, achieving one victory after another, and established the provincial revolutionary committee in August this year. In the face of the increasingly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Yunnan Province, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their defeat, used every means to obstruct and sabotage revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and to sabotage the deepening development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement. In this fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, under the wise leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and every battle order of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, leading the 23 million revolutionary people of all nationalities in the province to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee led the revolutionary people of all nationalities in the province to deeply criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," mobilize the masses to fight against the attempts of a handful of class enemies to split the unity of the revolutionary masses, incite the revolutionary masses against the revolutionary committees, and instigate a part of the people to create "independent kingdoms," directing the spearhead against the newly born revolutionary committees. The evil plots were resolutely fought against, making the revolutionary people of all nationalities in the province, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve unified understanding, unified steps, and unified actions, greatly promoting the deepening development of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee also led the revolutionary people of all nationalities in the province to smash the evil activities of a handful of class enemies attempting to incite military-civilian relations, further strengthening military-civilian unity.

Under the great instruction of Chairman Mao that the working class must lead everything, all industrial and mining enterprises in the province actively selected a large number of outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which marched into colleges and universities and other superstructural domains in a grand manner. Under the leadership of the working class, these units further achieved and consolidated revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

At present, the revolutionary situation in the entire province of Yunnan is excellent and getting better. A grand mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is flourishing.

    在各级革命委员会领导下，各族革命人民决心搞好斗批改，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利
    云南专、州、市、县革委会全部成立
    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利
    据新华社昆明十六日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在贯彻落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务中，在全省各族革命人民深入学习党内两条路线斗争史的群众运动推动下，云南省十三个专区、自治州、市，一百二十八个县全部成立了革命委员会。全省绝大多数的工矿企业和农村人民公社也都成立了革命委员会。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    十二月十六日，在祖国西南边疆的春城——昆明，云南省和昆明市三十万军民隆重举行集会，热烈庆祝全省实现了一片红。同一天，全省各专区、自治州、市所在地也分别召开了数万人的庆祝大会。在云南省和昆明市隆重举行的集会上，省、市革委会和人民解放军昆明部队负责人分别讲了话。他们号召全省军民更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展党内两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步掀起斗、批、改高潮，全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，云南省革命委员会立即领导全省各族革命人民群众，在全省范围内掀起了一个学习、宣传和落实全会公报的群众运动。全省各族革命人民遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示，以毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的光辉报告为教材，广泛、深入地学习了党内两条路线斗争的历史。全省许多专区、自治州和市、县还专门开办了以学习党内两条路线斗争史和贯彻落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习，全省各族革命人民大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步提高了执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，从而大大加速了革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐，使各级革命委员会联翩出现。保山专区的潞西、瑞丽、陇川、盈江、梁河五个边防县和边防线上的重镇畹町，由于一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋破坏，革命的大联合和革命的三结合迟迟不能实现。在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，在学习两条路线斗争史的推动下，这五县一镇的各族革命群众迅速提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，深入开展了革命大批判，揭穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，全部成立了革委会。
    地处祖国西南边疆的云南，是同帝、修、反斗争的前线，阶级斗争非常尖锐复杂。解放以后，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇带着他的老婆曾经三进三出云南，跟他在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民之流紧密勾结，招降纳叛，狼狈为奸，在云南推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图把云南变成他们复辟资本主义的基地。无产阶级文化大革命中，云南省广大工人、贫下中农、各族革命群众在人民解放军支持下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对刘少奇及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民进行了英勇顽强的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利，于今年八月成立了省革命委员会。在云南省无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好的情况下，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于他们的失败，他们千方百计地阻挠和破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合，破坏斗、批、改运动的深入发展。在这两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，云南省革命委员会在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，率领全省两千三百万各族革命人民，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。省革委会领导全省各族革命人民，深刻地批判了反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，发动群众同一小撮阶级敌人妄图分裂革命群众之间的团结，挑拨革命群众和革委会的关系，煽动一部分人大搞“独立王国”，把矛头指向新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋进行了坚决的斗争，使全省各族革命人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，大大推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。省革委会还领导全省各族革命人民粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图挑拨军民关系的罪恶活动，进一步加强了军民团结。
    在毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大指示指引下，全省各厂矿企业积极选派了大批优秀工人，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，浩浩荡荡地开进了大专院校和其它上层建筑领域。在工人阶级的领导下，这些单位进一步实现和巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    目前，云南全省革命形势一片大好，越来越好。一个声势浩大的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动正在蓬勃发展。
