Mao Zedong Thought shines on the Mao Shengshi Brigade in Qinghai, Xinjing, in the northern suburbs of Ma Fang Commune. Before liberation, life was impoverished and sparsely populated. Many people came here to beg and settle down. After liberation, they stood up, received land, and their lives improved day by day. However, under the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, this brigade also experienced the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract," severely damaging the collective economy.

The spring breeze of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution blew to Mao Shengshi. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants overthrew a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and seized power. From then on, Mao Shengshi Brigade saw people's thoughts change and the land transform. This year, grain production increased by 47% compared to last year, total income increased by 70%, and water conservancy projects equaled the total of the past 18 years since liberation. From a backward "burden brigade," it leaped to become a bright red flag on the Qinghai Plateau.

The fundamental reason for the earth-shaking changes in Mao Shengshi Brigade is that the broad revolutionary masses actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Here are a few small stories of how they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works.

The Red Children's Volunteer Herding Team

Mao Shengshi Brigade has a "Red Children's Volunteer Herding Team." The oldest among them is only 12 or 13 years old, and the youngest is just 7 or 8.

When talking about the Red Children's Volunteer Herding Team, the commune members all give a thumbs up, saying they are good children nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Before the Cultural Revolution, these children were poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They spent their days either cramming books or playing at home and were unwilling to work in the brigade.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army came to Mao Shengshi Brigade and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. After school, the children would go to the study classes. After learning Chairman Mao's teaching, "You young people are in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. The future is in your hands," they realized that if they continued as before, they could not become red successors and would disappoint Chairman Mao. From then on, they changed completely.

During the busy spring plowing season, labor was in short supply, so the brigade decided to let the children help herd sheep. The brigade leader discussed with the children, saying, "The brigade's sheep want you to herd them, but I don't know if you can complete the task?" The son of a poor peasant, Xiao Bu, stood up and said, "In the past, Liu Shaoqi made us focus on studying and not participate in labor, causing us to be detached from production and the working people. Chairman Mao has shown us the direction. We must follow Chairman Mao's words and love labor." The other children also unanimously said, "We will definitely complete the task." The brigade leader smiled in satisfaction. The next day, the children officially became volunteer herders.

One day, while the children were herding sheep on a hillside, it suddenly started raining. The rain soaked the lambs, making them cry. Xiao Bu felt heartbroken and thought, "The sheep belong to the brigade. If they get cold, the collective property will suffer losses." Thinking this, he immediately took off his clothes and covered a lamb. Xiao Bu was soaked in the rain, feeling very cold, but seeing the lambs stop crying, his heart felt warm. Xiao Bu's selfless action moved the other children, and they all took off their clothes to cover the sheep.

At the year-end evaluation meeting, Xiao Bu and four other children were awarded the title of "Red Children." Now, these children are both students and young herders. The commune members are satisfied and praise them, saying they will definitely become "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers."

The "Old Men's Canal"

In the past, Mao Shengshi Brigade had a custom where men over 50 generally did not participate in collective labor. After the People's Liberation Army came to the brigade, they organized these old men to study Chairman Mao's works. Someone told the soldiers, "Our brigade has an old man named Jia Dequ, who has a lot of influence among the elderly. If we can do a good job with him, the others will be easier to handle." So, the soldiers went to talk to Jia Dequ. With the help of the soldiers, Jia Dequ actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and established the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. He not only actively participated in collective labor but also cared for the collective in every way. Following Jia Dequ's lead, more than ten old men organized themselves and took on the task of building a canal in the northern mountains.

For these old men, building the canal was a very arduous task. They had to go more than a mile away to carry stones. Some had swollen shoulders, blistered hands, and feet with blisters, but they continued to work without rest, feeling no pain or fatigue. They only thought about completing the canal task early and increasing grain production for the collective. They said, "We have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, and we have endless energy. No matter how big the difficulty, we are not afraid." After 23 days of hard work, the old men finally completed the 400-meter-long canal, saving the collective 3,000 yuan and ensuring that 90 acres of spring seedlings were watered. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants praised, "This canal is a canal shining with the glory of Mao Zedong Thought," and named it the "Old Men's Canal."

A Letter of Praise

The 66-year-old poor peasant, Zhou Zhongyue, suffered greatly under the oppression and exploitation of landlords in the old society, so he harbored deep hatred for the old society and had a fiery red heart for the Party and Chairman Mao. He was selfless and loved the collective.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely selfless and dedicated to others," Zhou Zhongyue often did good deeds. One evening, he went to the mountains to check the water and saw that the canal of the Ma Fang Brigade was broken. He thought, "The crops of the Ma Fang Brigade are also our brigade's crops, all watered with the blood of the poor and lower-middle peasants! We must not let the collective economy suffer losses." So, he used his straw hat to block the water, but the hat was washed away, so he took off his cotton jacket to block it. The jacket was also washed away, and the water hole became bigger. Seeing that several hundred acres of wheat were about to be flooded, at this critical moment, he remembered Chairman Mao's affectionate teaching: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." The great leader Chairman Mao's teaching gave him endless strength. Without hesitation, he jumped into the water up to his waist and used his broad body to block the water hole. Until people from the Ma Fang Brigade came, he came out of the water. Zhou did good deeds and never told the brigade. When the Ma Fang Brigade sent a letter of praise to Mao Shengshi, everyone knew.

Because Zhou Zhongyue actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and was selfless, the poor and lower-middle peasants elected him to attend the Xinjing City Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works.

### 毛泽东思想的阳光普照毛胜时大队

    毛泽东思想的阳光普照毛胜时大队
    青海西宁北郊马坊公社毛胜时大队，解放前生活贫困、人烟稀少。很多人都是讨饭流浪到这里安家落户的。解放后，他们翻了身，分了地，生活一天比一天好起来。但是，在大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的影响下，这个大队也刮起了“三自一包”的黑风，集体经济受到严重损害。
    无产阶级文化大革命的春风吹到了毛胜时。在支农解放军的帮助下，广大贫下中农造了党内一小撮走资派的反，掌握了领导权。从此，毛胜时大队人变思想地换装。今年，粮食比去年增产百分之四十七，总收入增长百分之七十，水利建设工程等于解放后十八年的总和，由一个落后的
  “包袱队”，一跃成为青海高原的一面鲜艳红旗。
    毛胜时大队所以发生天翻地覆的变化，根本的原因，是广大革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作。下面就是他们活学活用毛主席著作的几个小故事。红孩子义务放牧队
    毛胜时大队有个“红孩子义务放牧队”。他们中最大的不过十二三岁，最小的只有七、八岁。
    提起红孩子义务放牧队，社员们都伸出大拇指，说他们是毛泽东思想哺育出来的好孩子。文化大革命以前，这些孩子在大工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害下，整天除了死啃书本，回家就是玩。不愿意到队里干活。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛胜时大队来了支农解放军，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。孩子们放学回家就到学习班学习。他们学习了毛主席“你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上”的教导以后，认识到再要象过去那样，就不能做红色接班人，就要辜负毛主席的希望。从此，他们大变了样。
    春耕大忙时期，劳动力比较紧张，队里决定让孩子们帮助放羊。队长找到孩子们商量说：“队里的羊想让你们放，不知你们能不能完成任务？”贫农的儿子小卜站起来说：“以前，刘少奇让我们专心读书，不让我们参加劳动，使我们脱离生产，脱离劳动人民。毛主席给我们指出了方向，我们就是要听毛主席的话，热爱劳动。”其余的孩子们也都异口同声地说：“我们一定能完成任务。”队长满意地笑了。第二天孩子们正式担任了义务放牧员。
    一天，孩子们正在山坡上放羊，忽然下起雨来了，大雨浇得小羊羔直叫唤。小卜心痛得很，他想：羊是队里的，冻坏了，集体财产就要受到损失。想到这里，他毫不犹豫地把身上穿的衣服脱下来盖在一只小羊羔身上。小卜淋着雨，虽然很冷，但他看到小羊羔不叫了，心里却热呼呼的。小卜舍己为公的行动，感动了别的孩子们，他们一个个地都把自己身上的衣服脱下来盖在羊身上。
    在年终评选会上，小卜等五个孩子被评为“红孩子”。现在，这些孩子既是学生又是小牧民。社员们满意地称赞他们将来一定会成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。“老　汉　渠”
    毛胜时大队过去有个风俗习惯，年过五十岁的老汉一般都不再参加集体劳动。支农解放军来到这个大队以后，就组织这些老汉学习毛主席著作。有人对解放军说：“我们大队有个老汉叫贾德奎，他在老年人中很有威信，如果把他的工作做好了，别人就好办了。”于是，解放军同志就找贾老汉做思想工作。在解放军同志的帮助下，贾老汉活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，他不但积极参加了集体劳动，而且处处关心集体。在贾德奎老汉的带动下，十来个老汉自动组织起来，主动承担在北山修建一条水渠的任务。
    对这些老汉来说，修水渠是非常艰巨的任务。他们要到一里多路以外的地方去抬石头，有的人肩膀压肿了，双手磨破了，脚上起了泡，但他们仍然一刻不停地奋战着，一点也不觉得疼，不觉得累，一心想的是早日完成修渠任务，为集体多增产粮食。他们说：“我们掌握了毛泽东思想，就有使不完的劲，再大的困难也不怕。”经过二十三天的艰苦奋战，老汉们终于修好了这条长达四百米的水渠，为集体节约了三千元的开支，保证了九十亩地的春苗浇上了水。广大贫下中农称赞说：“这条水渠是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的水渠”，并把这条水渠命名为“老汉渠”。一封表扬信
    六十六岁的贫农老汉周仲岳，在旧社会受尽了地主的压迫和剥削，因此他对旧社会有刻骨的仇恨，对党和毛主席有一颗火热的红心。他一心为公，热爱集体。
    周仲岳老汉遵照毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，经常做好事。一天晚上，他到山上巡水，看到马坊大队的水渠坏了，心想：马坊大队的庄稼也就是我们队的庄稼，都是贫下中农的心血浇灌成的啊！绝不能让集体经济受损失。于是他就用草帽堵水，草帽被冲走了，又脱下棉衣堵，棉衣也被冲走了，水洞越冲越大，眼看几百亩麦子就要被水淹。在这紧要关头，他想起了毛主席的亲切教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”伟大领袖毛主席的教导给他增添了无穷的力量，他毫不犹豫地跳进齐腰深的水里，用宽大的身体堵住了水洞。直到马坊大队来人，他才从水里出来。周老汉做了好事，从来不向队里说，当马坊大队把表扬信送到毛胜时时，大家才知道。
    由于周仲岳活学活用毛主席著作，一心为公，贫下中农推选他出席了西宁市学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。
