The Thai Communist Party-led people's armed forces in Northeastern Thailand have harnessed the power of people's war to smash the counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S.-Thanom clique and have launched proactive attacks, annihilating a large number of enemy forces and achieving brilliant victories.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station reported on November 28 that, according to incomplete statistics, from January to mid-November this year, the people's armed forces in Northeastern Thailand engaged in approximately 300 battles with the U.S.-Thanom reactionary military and police, killing and wounding about 500 enemy personnel, and destroying or damaging five enemy aircraft.

The radio station said that from March to July, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries mobilized 15 battalions to launch a counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the people's armed forces in the Northeast. The people's armed forces in Sakhon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, and Kalasin provinces, using flexible and mobile tactics, smashed the enemy's counterrevolutionary "encirclement and suppression," killing and wounding more than 150 enemy personnel and destroying two enemy aircraft. At the end of July, the people's armed forces in Udon Thani province, with the close cooperation of the local people, bravely attacked the U.S. Udon Thani Air Base, killing and wounding five U.S.-Thai reactionary troops and destroying or damaging three U.S. aircraft.

The radio station pointed out that the rapid development and continuous victories of the people's armed forces in the Northeast have dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station reported on November 28 that the brave people's armed forces in Chiang Rai province, led by the Thai Communist Party, recently attacked and destroyed the command center of the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique in Chiang Rai.

The radio station said that, according to news from the northern front of Thailand, on the evening of September 23, the daring and victorious people's armed forces in Chiang Rai province seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the "anti-communist command center" of the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique in Chiang Rai. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered a crushing defeat. The people's armed forces killed and wounded more than 50 enemy personnel with no casualties of their own, achieving a brilliant victory.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station reported on November 26 that the people's armed forces in Nakhon Sawan province, led by the Thai Communist Party, shot down a U.S.-Thanom reactionary helicopter with rifles on October 8, killing all ten enemy personnel on board.

The radio station said that the people's armed forces in Nakhon Sawan province had previously shot down a U.S.-Thanom reactionary helicopter on September 7, killing all enemy personnel on board.

The radio station said that the Thai people were overjoyed by the victories achieved by the people's armed forces in Nakhon Sawan province.
