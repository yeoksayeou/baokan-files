**Editor's Note from Red Flag Magazine:** The third issue of this magazine introduced the experience of carrying out an educational revolution in the Water Source People's Commune of Yingkou County. Now we are introducing the experience of the Songshu Production Brigade's commune-run primary school in the same county. There is a comparison here: how a "standardized" primary school funded by the state was controlled by bourgeois intellectuals, and how a primary school run by poor and lower-middle peasants in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions was welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. This school broke all kinds of rules and regulations, thoroughly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Admission was not restricted by age; students could enroll by season, come late and leave early. Those with heavy household chores could bring their younger siblings to class. They also established four teaching points in eight production teams. They worked themselves to run the school for four years without collecting a single cent from the students. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "With such a school and such teachers, our descendants will not change color!"

In the southern mountainous area of Liaoning Province, there is a new type of rural school—Songshu Primary School. Under the cultivation and management of the poor and lower-middle peasants, it has grown healthily along the proletarian educational line of Chairman Mao. It stands tall like a pine tree, deeply rooted in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The poor and lower-middle peasants' desire for cultural emancipation has been realized.

Songshu Primary School is located in the Songshu Production Brigade of Jianyi People's Commune, Yingkou County, with 231 households scattered along the banks of two gullies and five forks of a river. In the old society, there was only one school in the vicinity of five production brigades, with 53 students, of which only two were from Songshu, and they were children of landlords and rich peasants. Now, more than 70% of the poor and lower-middle peasants over the age of 35 in the entire brigade are illiterate.

After liberation, due to the dominance of the revisionist educational line, a so-called "standardized" primary school was established by the state about seven or eight miles away from the Songshu Production Brigade. In addition to charging tuition and book fees or demanding firewood, grain, and cocoons under the name of labor-study, the school also had strict requirements for students' clothing, making it difficult for many children of poor and lower-middle peasants to attend. The poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out that the school was too far from home; the burden was too heavy; the school was too Westernized; and the teachers were unreliable. They angrily said: "Running such a school is to prevent our children from attending." Until 1964, more than 45% of school-age children in this brigade still could not attend school.

In 1964, Chairman Mao's "Talk at the Spring Festival Symposium" and other instructions on the educational revolution reached the Songshu Production Brigade. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed to hear Chairman Mao's instruction that "for communes and production brigades with conditions, it should be allowed to run schools." They decided to run their own school. At that time, some people said: "Peasants running a school is pure nonsense; it will be blown away by the wind." Some cadres even sabotaged the effort from behind.

The poor and lower-middle peasants did not listen to this nonsense. Old peasant Li Shengwen said: "Chairman Mao told us to run a school, and we must run it!" Everyone said: "We peasants will run a peasant school. We know what kind of people we should cultivate. There is no classroom, everywhere is a classroom; there are no teachers, everyone is a teacher." In this way, they started the school. Now, it has developed from one class with 14 students in 1964 to four grades, seven classes, and 155 students, with more than 90% of school-age children enrolled.

The school is completely managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Songshu Primary School was managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants from the start. At that time, under the leadership of the brigade party branch, an "Education Committee" was established. Now, under the leadership of the brigade revolutionary committee, an "Educational Revolution Committee" with the participation of poor and lower-middle peasants has been established to manage the school's "three powers": personnel, curriculum, and finances.

Over the past four years, how have the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Songshu Production Brigade managed the school?

They selected reliable people from the returned educated youth to be teachers. In the past, many bad people had infiltrated the teaching staff of "standard" schools, and the poor and lower-middle peasants had raised many objections, but none were resolved. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said: "Even livestock keepers are selected by us, why can't we select teachers!" So, when they ran their own school, they determined that teachers must be selected through extensive discussions and repeated investigations, and must be returned educated youth with good class background, good thoughts, good labor, and deep feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: "We are confident in handing over our children to teachers we have selected ourselves."

They fundamentally changed the teaching content and methods. The poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "revolutionize education" and broke the shackles of the revisionist educational line. Without textbooks, they compiled and printed their own, making "Long Live Chairman Mao" the first lesson, including the "Eight-Character Constitution" and names of farm tools in the textbooks, and removing all the reactionary, feudal, and bourgeois garbage from the old unified textbooks such as "Kong Rong Gives Up the Pear" and "Little Dirty Hands." They added courses on Chairman Mao's works, class education, and production technology, implementing Chairman Mao's instruction that "textbooks should have local characteristics." In teaching methods, they closely linked theory with practice, with students spending half a day in class and half a day in labor, frequently participating in social activities. During the busy farming season, classes gave way to production. Class education and production technology courses adopted the method of "going out and inviting in," letting the poor and lower-middle peasants take the stage. Teachers also often organized senior students to teach junior students. Over the years, they only increased the number of classes without increasing the number of teachers, and the teaching quality continued to improve. Teachers became organizers of school education, social education, and family education, creating a lively and vibrant teaching situation.

The school's expenditures and teachers' remuneration were all decided by the poor and lower-middle peasants through discussions. Teachers implemented the work-point system, recording work points by the day, and receiving the same pay as commune members. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Such teachers have the same heart as us, and when we do things together, it's like being in the same family."

Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Songshu Production Brigade said: "In running schools in the countryside, only we ourselves can manage them well. If we let the bourgeois intellectuals seize power, they will definitely turn our schools yellow."

Thoroughly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The commune-run primary school of the Songshu Production Brigade firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian educational policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." Therefore, it was suppressed and obstructed by a small handful of capitalist roaders, who tried to strangle it. Some people with serious bourgeois ideas also strongly disparaged this school, saying things like "a rabbit's tail can't grow long," and "studying here, you'll still have to crawl in the ditches." They did not allow their children to study here. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Songshu Production Brigade firmly replied: "This is a school run according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We cultivate our own good descendants, and we walk a different path from the landlords and rich peasants." A production team leader also said: "After finishing school, we still work in the fields. This is the fundamental principle."

There were no classrooms, so the kang (traditional heated bed) in the commune members' homes, the straw sheds of the production teams, the blacksmith's forge, and the trees by the river were all classrooms. There were no desks and chairs, so small boxes, flower baskets, small stools, broken cow troughs, and old benches were used as desks and chairs. To solve the past problem of "children are small and can't be sent, children are big and can't be sent," and to allow the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to attend school nearby, they made do with what they had and established four teaching points in eight production teams.

At the same time, they broke all kinds of rules and regulations. Students with heavy household chores could bring their younger siblings to class, come late and leave early, and enroll by season. There was no age limit for enrollment. Two women team leaders, to better study Chairman Mao's works, came to school during the farming off-season.

Participating in productive labor is a basic course for students. At the same time, digging medicinal herbs, collecting tree seeds, and chopping firewood and other labor-study activities were also carried out long-term. Over the past four years, they have collected more than 60,000 jin of firewood, solving the heating problem and supporting the production team. They also earned more than 200 yuan, solving the school's miscellaneous expenses and students' learning materials. For four years of running the school, they did not collect a single cent from the students. Before the Cultural Revolution, they did not spend a single cent from the state. This is in stark contrast to the so-called "standard" school nearby, so the poor and lower-middle peasants proudly said: "This is the Yan'an style!"

New school, new people.

The students cultivated by Songshu Primary School love Chairman Mao, are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, love the collective, and love labor. Every day, the first thing they do when they arrive at school is to participate in the "Three Loyalty" activities, and the first thing they do when they return home is to participate in labor. Everyone has become an active participant and organizer in learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, frequently active in the fields, streets, households, and production teams.

Last year, after Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central South, and East China, his latest instructions were delivered to the poor and lower-middle peasants by them, knocking on every door. The "July 3" and "July 24" proclamations were also spread by them, making them known to every household. They have an intense hatred for Liu Shaoqi, and everyone takes the stage at the criticism meetings, with walls and tree trunks filled with slogans. The poor and lower-middle peasants call them propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and call the school the "brigade's propaganda department." The students of Songshu Primary School participate in labor, fearing neither dirt nor hard work. They collect manure and grains for the production team. A poor peasant compared his two children, saying: "The one in the public school learned less and became lazier the more he studied. The one in the labor-study school loves to work, can propagate, and what he learns can be used." An old peasant said: "Once, there were oil worms in the team's field. I called my two daughters to pick the oil worms. The one studying in the public school said: 'It's so dirty, I won't do it.' The one studying in the labor-study school, however, did it happily. Truly, two kinds of schools, two different paths. In the future, I will let them both go to the labor-study school to study Mao Zedong Thought."

The growth process of Songshu Primary School is also the process of three female teachers receiving re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Most or a large majority of students trained in old schools can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct line leadership, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Over the past four years, the teachers of Songshu Primary School have closely combined with the poor and lower-middle peasants and achieved great results.

The daughter of a poor peasant, Xu Jingfang, when she first entered the makeshift classroom of a broken straw shed and saw the three-legged high table, she thought of her own experience in a Western-style school and regretted not going to the fields to earn a "comfortable work point." At this time, old peasant Li Shengwen took the initiative to remind her of the suffering, oppression, and lack of culture in the old society, encouraging her to strive for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some poor and lower-middle peasants also gave her works like "In Memory of Norman Bethune." This deeply educated her, and she made up her mind to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life. Over the years, she often labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learned from them, and regarded the poor and lower-middle peasants as her teachers. She truly did one thing: teach, learn, be a teacher, and be a student. She said from the bottom of her heart: "The poor and lower-middle peasants are my good teachers." The masses affectionately called her "the good girl of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

In 1967, the brigade decided to give each of them a subsidy of 13 yuan. But they firmly refused, saying: "We are also commune members, and taking this money would be extra." The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "With such a school and such teachers, our descendants will not change color!"

After the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "let the poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools" was issued, this school became even more popular. Those who studied in the so-called "standard" primary school flocked to this school.

    一所贫下中农掌权的民办小学
    ——从松树小学的成长看农村办学的方向
    辽宁省的调查报告
    《红旗》杂志编者按：本刊第三期介绍过营口县水源公社开展教育革命的经验，现在介绍的是这个县建一公社松树大队民办小学的经验。这里有一个比较：一所由国家花钱办的“正规化”小学怎样被资产阶级知识分子所控制，一所根据毛主席的指示由生产大队贫下中农办的小学怎样受贫下中农欢迎。这个学校打破了种种清规戒律，彻底为贫下中农服务，入学不受年龄限制，可以按季上学，可以晚来早走，家务重的可以带着弟弟妹妹上课，还在八个生产队里建立四个教学点。自己劳动，办学四年，没有收学生一分钱。贫下中农说：“有这样的学校，这样的老师，我们的后代就不会变颜色了！”
    在辽宁省南部山区，有一所新型的农村学校——松树小学。它在贫下中农的培育和管理下，沿着毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，健康地成长起来了。它象松树一样，巍然挺立，深深地扎根于贫下中农的心中。
    贫下中农文化翻身的愿望实现了
    松树小学的所在地，营口县建一公社松树大队，有二百三十一户人家，分散在两沟、五岔、一道河的两岸。旧社会，在附近五个大队境内只有一所学校，五十三名学生，其中松树仅有两名，还是地、富子弟。现在全大队三十五岁以上的贫下中农，有百分之七十多是文盲。
    解放后，由于修正主义教育路线的统治，在离松树大队七、八里外的地方，国家花钱办了一所所谓“正规化”的小学，除了照规定要学费、书费或以勤工俭学为名要烧柴、粮食、大茧等等外，对学生的穿戴也常有过苛要求，使得不少贫下中农子女，因此不能就学。贫下中农指出，这个学校离家远走不得；负担重受不得；学校洋进不得；教师杂信不得。他们气愤地说：“办这样学校，就是不想让我们子女入学。”直到一九六四年这个大队还有百分之四十五以上的适龄儿童没能入学。
    一九六四年，毛主席的“在春节座谈会上的谈话”和其他有关教育革命的指示传到了松树大队，广大贫下中农听到毛主席“关于社办、队办学校问题，有条件的应该允许办”的指示，无不欢欣鼓舞，决定自己办学。这时却有人说：“庄稼人办学校，纯粹瞎胡闹，一阵风就得吹。”个别干部还在背后拆台。
    贫下中农没听这个邪。老贫农李生文说：“毛主席叫咱办学校，咱们一定把它办起来！”大家说：“咱庄稼人就办庄稼学校，我们知道，该把孩子培养成什么样的人。没课堂，处处是课堂，没教师，人人都是教师。”就这样，他们把学校办起来了。现在，已从一九六四年办学时一个班十四名学生，发展到四个年级，七个班，一百五十五名学生，百分之九十以上的适龄儿童入了学。
        完全由贫下中农掌权
    松树小学从根上就是由贫下中农掌权。当时，在大队党支部领导下，成立了“办学委员会”，现在，在大队革委会领导下，成立了有贫下中农参加的“教育革命委员会”，来掌管学校的“三权”，即人权、文权、财权。
    四年来，松树大队的贫下中农是怎样管理学校的呢？
    由贫下中农从回乡知识青年中选拔可靠的人做教师。过去，在“正规”学校教师队伍里混进很多坏人，贫下中农曾提过很多意见，但都未得到解决。贫下中农气愤地说：“饲养员都得我们挑选，老师为什么不能选！”所以，他们自己办学的时候，确定教师都是经过广泛讨论，反复考察，必须是成份好、思想好、劳动好、对贫下中农有深厚感情的回乡知识青年。他们说：“把孩子交给自己选的教师，我们放心。”
    从根本上改变了教学内容和教学方法。贫下中农遵照毛主席“教育要革命”的教导，打破了修正主义教育路线所制定的条条框框。没有教材，他们就自己编写油印课本，把“毛主席万岁”做为第一课，“八字宪法”、农具名称也编进课本，把旧的统一课本中《孔融让梨》、《小脏手》等封、资、修的黑货统统删去，并增加了毛主席著作课、阶级教育课、生产技术课，实现了毛主席“教材要有地方性”的教导。在教学方法上，他们密切联系实际，学生半天上课，半天劳动，经常参加社会活动。农忙季节，课程为生产让路。阶级教育课、生产技术课，采取了“走出去，请进来”的办法，让贫下中农占领讲台。教师并经常组织高年级学生教低年级学生。几年来，只增加班级，未增加教师，教学质量仍然不断提高。教师成了学校教育、社会教育和家庭教育的组织者，创造出了一个生动活泼的教学局面。
    学校的经费开支、教师报酬，都由贫下中农讨论决定。教师实行工分制，按日记工，与社员同工同酬。贫下中农说：“这样的老师，和我们一个心眼，办起事来也象一家人。”
    毛主席最近深刻指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”松树大队贫下中农说：“在农村办学，只有我们自己掌大权，才能办得好，要让资产阶级知识分子篡了权，准把我们的学校给办黄了。”
        彻底为贫下中农服务
    松树大队的民办小学坚决贯彻毛主席的“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的无产阶级教育方针，因而遭到了一小撮走资派的压制、刁难，妄图把它扼杀掉。一些剥削阶级思想严重的人也极力贬低这所学校，说什么“兔子尾巴长不了”，“在这里念书，将来还得爬地垄沟子”，不准他们的子女到这里上学。松树大队的贫下中农坚定地回答说：“这是毛主席叫办的学校，我们培养自己的好后代，和地主、富农走的就是两条路。”一个生产队长也说：“念完书还是为农，这是根本。”
    没有教室，社员家的土炕上，生产队的草栏子，铁匠炉旁和树下河边就是教室，没有桌凳，小箱子、花匣子、小板凳、破牛槽、旧条桌就当桌凳。为解决过去那种“孩子小舍不得，孩子大搭不得”的矛盾，使贫下中农子女就近上学，他们因陋就简，分散建点，在八个生产队里建立了四个教学点。
    同时，还打破了一切清规戒律，家务重的学生可以带着弟弟妹妹上课，也可以晚来早走，还可以按季上学，入学儿童不受年龄限制。有两个妇女队长为更好地学习毛主席著作，就是利用农闲时来上学的。
    参加生产劳动是学生的一门基本课。同时，挖药材、采树籽、砍烧柴等各项勤工俭学劳动，也都长期坚持着。四年来他们共拣了六万多斤烧柴，除解决取暖问题外，还支援了生产队，另外又收入二百多元，解决了学校的杂费和学生的学习用品。办学四年，没收学生一分钱，文化大革命前，没花国家一分钱。这就和附近的所谓“正规”学校成了鲜明对比，因而贫下中农自豪地说：“我们这才是延安作风呢！”
      新学校里育新人
    松树小学培养的学生，热爱毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，热爱集体，热爱劳动。他们每天到校的第一件事是做“三忠于”活动，回家的第一件事是参加劳动。个个都成了学习和宣传毛泽东思想的积极参加者和组织者，经常活跃在田间、街头、住户和生产队。
    去年毛主席视察华北、中南、华东地区后发表的最新指示，就是他们挨门逐户地传达到贫下中农那里去的。“七·三”、
  “七·二四”布告，也是通过他们，达到家喻户晓。他们对刘少奇无比仇恨，批判会上人人上阵，墙壁、树干，处处写满了标语。贫下中农称他们是毛泽东思想宣传员，称学校为“大队的宣传部”。松树小学的学生，参加劳动，也是泼泼辣辣，不嫌脏，不怕累。拾粪、拣粮都交给生产队。一个贫农社员对比了他的两个孩子说：“在公办学校的那个，学的东西少，越学越懒。在耕读小学的这个，爱干活、能宣传，学的东西能用上。”一个老贫农说：“有一次，队的地里起了油虫，我叫我的两个女儿都去捋油虫，在公办学校念书的那个说：‘怪脏的，我才不干呢。’在耕读小学念书的这个却干的满欢。真是两种学校，两路门道，往后我要叫她俩都去耕读小学，学习毛泽东思想。”
    松树小学成长的过程，也是三名女教师接受贫下中农再教育的过程。伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”四年来，松树小学的教师紧密地和贫下中农相结合，作出了很大成绩。
    贫农女儿徐靖芳，当她第一次走进做为教室的破草栏子，看到了三条腿的高桌时，便想起了自己住过的洋学校，后悔不如下地劳动、挣个“舒心分”算了。这时老贫农李生文主动地给她忆旧社会受压迫、被剥削、没有文化的苦，鼓励她为贫下中农争气。有的贫下中农还给她送来了《为人民服务》等光辉著作。这使她受到了深刻的教育，下定了决心，一辈子为贫下中农服务。几年来，她经常同贫下中农一块劳动，向贫下中农学习，拜贫下中农为师。做到了一面教，一面学，一面当先生，一面当学生。她发自内心地说：“贫下中农就是我的好老师。”群众都亲热地叫她“贫下中农的好丫头”。
    一九六七年大队曾决定给她们每人补助十三元钱。但她们坚决没要，说：“我们也是社员，要这个钱就是额外的了。”贫下中农高兴地说：“有这样的学校，这样的老师，我们的后代就不会变颜色了！”
    在伟大领袖毛主席“贫下中农管理学校”的指示发出后，这所学校更加人心所向了。那些在所谓“正规”小学读书的学生，纷纷来到了这所学校。辽宁省革命委员会解放军某部联合调查组（载《红旗》杂志一九六八年第五期）
