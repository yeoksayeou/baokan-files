Four thousand dockworkers in Melbourne, Australia, went on strike on December 13 to protest against the unreasonable search of dockworkers by customs authorities.

A group of coal miners at the Rosewood Coal Mine in Australia also held a demonstration in the mine on December 13, protesting against the threat by the reactionary authorities to dismiss 40 miners. They demanded that the government take effective measures to ensure full employment for workers.

Not long ago, nearly 3,000 teachers from technical schools in the state of Victoria went on strike to demand a wage increase. The striking teachers held a rally of 2,000 people in Melbourne and announced that they would go on strike again the day after the new semester begins in February next year.
