The Ministry of National Defense held a report meeting this morning to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army.

The Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Ambassador to China, Vuong Minh Quan, and Military Attaché Colonel Chen Wenping, were invited to attend the meeting.

In the midst of enthusiastic applause, Military Attaché Chen Wenping delivered a report. He introduced the glorious history of the Vietnam People's Army, which has grown strong under the leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and the victories it has achieved in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

Chen Wenping said that the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation has already achieved and is achieving great victories. The American imperialists have suffered heavy defeats in both North and South Vietnam, but their reactionary and aggressive nature will not change. They still do not give up their ambition to invade Vietnam and continue to intensify their aggressive war in South Vietnam. Our people in the North are determined to fight to the end and support the people in the South with a spirit of revolutionary offensive. At the same time, we are ready to defeat any new military adventurism by the American imperialists in North Vietnam. We resolutely respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to hold our guns firmly and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

When talking about the friendship between the peoples and armies of the two countries, Chen Wenping said that under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by the respected Chairman Mao, the 700 million Chinese people have given great assistance and support to the Vietnamese people in all aspects, and this assistance and support are continuously strengthening. Chairman Mao Zedong's statement in August 1963 and the telegram sent by Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai on December 19, 1968, to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, are concrete manifestations of the combat unity between China and Vietnam, embodying the iron will of the 700 million Chinese people to firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against American aggression to the end.

Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wang Xinting, Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department, Han Zhenji, and responsible personnel from various military branches and the Beijing Garrison, as well as 1,000 officers and soldiers from the army, navy, and air force, attended the meeting.

Deputy Director of the Office of the Ministry of National Defense, Pan Zhenwu, first addressed the meeting. He enthusiastically praised the Vietnamese people and their army, under the leadership of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, for fully demonstrating the immense power of people's war, fighting bravely and tenaciously against the most ferocious American imperialism of the contemporary era, and defeating the American aggressors and their puppet armies, making them desperate and disgraced, achieving great victories.

Pan Zhenwu expressed: The Chinese people, who have been tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and become even stronger, will definitely follow the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against American aggression to the end.

    陈文彭在谈到越中两国人民和两国军队的友谊时说，在以敬爱的毛主席为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下的七亿中国人民，在各方面给了越南人民巨大援助和支持，这种援助和支持并日益得到加强。毛泽东主席一九六三年八月的声明和毛主席、林彪副主席和周恩来总理一九六八年十二月十九日给阮友寿主席的贺电，是中越战斗团结的具体表现，体现了兄弟的七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底的钢铁意志。
    中国人民解放军副总参谋长王新亭、总后勤部副部长韩振纪以及各军种和北京部队负责人，陆海空三军指战员一千人出席了报告会。
    国防部办公厅副主任潘振武首先在报告会上致词。他热情赞扬越南人民及其军队，在越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，充分发挥人民战争的无比威力，同当代最凶恶的美帝国主义进行了英勇顽强的战斗，把美国侵略强盗及其帮凶军打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，赢得了伟大的胜利。
    潘振武表示：经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼得更加坚强的中国人民，一定遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大教导，坚决支持英勇的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
