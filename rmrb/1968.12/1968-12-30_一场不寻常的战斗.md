This evening, the Jianjin Steel Plant was unusually busy and lively. The auditorium was brightly lit, with drums and gongs resounding, as the plant's propaganda team was performing a splendid artistic program. Several young workers, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," joyfully sang:

    In the east where the rainbow dances,
    A red sun rises high,
    Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
    Your brilliance illuminates the path of revolution....

    Every word, every sentence, touched the hearts of the workers. As their song ended, a burst of enthusiastic applause erupted. Military representative Cheng Jin, sitting in a corner at the back, was intently watching the performance. Suddenly, a young man in a greasy blue work uniform ran up to him, grabbed his arm, and said, "Old Cheng, you've been sitting here all along. I've been looking for you for a long time!"

    "What's the matter, Wei Min?"

    "Here, this is our workshop's initiative letter. Everyone has decided to modify the 'straw bag furnace' and present the first gift to 1969!"

    Wei Min excitedly explained.

    Cheng Jin heard that they wanted to modify the 'straw bag furnace' and immediately took the bright red initiative letter. He and Wei Min hurried out of the auditorium.

    It all started five years ago. A chief engineer came to the factory, and for some reason, he got carried away and wanted to build a "chain-type steelmaking furnace." This engineer was a "brand-name" expert who had studied abroad and was the darling of the factory's capitalist roaders. He didn't listen to the workers' opinions, spent more than twenty million yuan, and took several months to build this steelmaking furnace. However, after it was put into production, it kept producing defective products. So, the workers gave it a nickname: "Big Straw Bag." Later, the workers repeatedly suggested "modifying the furnace," but the capitalist roaders paid no attention. The workers didn't care about their nonsense and continued to research and work. The modification plan was finally proposed. But the power was in the hands of the capitalist roaders, who didn't provide materials or labor, and stubbornly blocked the progress. In this way, five years were wasted, and the furnace was not modified.

    On the way, Cheng Jin looked at the big red initiative letter with joy, while Wei Min kept talking like a machine gun. Just then, Master Yan Jiatai caught up from behind.

    "Master Yan, you just got off work, how..."

    Master Yan said, "Chairman Mao calls on us to seize the revolution and promote production. Tonight, everyone is going to fight the 'straw bag furnace' and present a gift to the new year. How can these two hands of mine be idle!"

    Master Yan Jiatai is nearly sixty years old. But since the Cultural Revolution, he has been rejuvenated and full of energy. Especially after being elected as the deputy director of the workshop revolutionary committee, he often works in shifts during the day and attends meetings and studies at night, never feeling tired.

    It was deep into the night. The small square in front of the furnace was crowded with people. The sounds of drums, cheers, and firecrackers rose and fell, like celebrating some festival. Everyone saw Cheng Jin and Master Yan coming, and they spontaneously applauded.

    Cheng Jin held up the initiative letter and expressed his firm support and warm congratulations to everyone. He said: Chairman Mao recently taught us, "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly talked about, repeatedly talked about. It's not enough to talk to a few people, it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." Chairman Mao's instructions are our beacon for progress. Just take our factory as an example. In the ten years since its establishment, it has experienced fierce struggles between two lines. From this furnace, we can clearly see how the great traitor Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Comrades, this is the battlefield where we defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line! We must criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi, making him never able to rise again!

    When it came to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the big traitor Liu Shaoqi, Master Yan's eyes flashed with anger. He said excitedly, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, "We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class," this is an unshakable great truth! But Liu Shaoqi said nonsense like, "The working class may be unreliable at certain times," and spread his reactionary "theory of the backwardness of the masses." This is clearly playing the opposite game with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! This is clearly the greatest slander against our working class! In short, he wants to crush us workers and let the capitalists take the stage. Bah! That will never happen. It is precisely because of this black backer, Liu Shaoqi, that the capitalist roaders in the factory are so bold, everything is decided by "experts" and engineers, and they never look at us. As a result, they have wasted a lot of people's property and committed countless crimes. This "straw bag furnace" is an ironclad evidence!

    As soon as Master Yan finished speaking, Wei Min jumped onto a big rock and shouted, "The communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee calls on us: 'We must seize the revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness, and build our socialist industry, socialist agriculture, and all socialist undertakings more excellently.' We, the working class, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, can overcome all enemies and create all miracles! This small 'straw bag furnace' we, these rough workers, will definitely modify it and turn it into a 'red-heart furnace,' using it to welcome the new leap that 1969 will bring, and to show our loyalty to Chairman Mao!"

    The night was boiling!

    Amidst a chorus of resounding slogans, Master Yan, Wei Min, Cheng Jin, and the workers, with deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi and boundless loyalty to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, began this "furnace modification" battle!

    The dawn light illuminated the vast land of the motherland. The bright red steel flowed out of the "red-heart furnace" like a broken dam, reflecting the joy on every face. The brilliant year of 1969 was about to arrive in the victory song.

    一场不寻常的战斗
    陈殿国
    这天晚上，跃进钢厂显得格外繁忙，格外火热。礼堂里，灯光通明，锣鼓喧天，本厂的宣传队正在表演精采的文艺节目。十几个青年工人，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，欢快地唱着：
    看彩霞飞舞的东方，
    升起一轮红太阳，
    毛主席啊毛主席，
    您的光辉把革命的路途照亮。……
    这每个字、每句话都唱到工人们的心坎上了。他们的歌声刚落，便爆发了一阵热烈的掌声。军代表程进，坐在后边的角落里，聚精会神地看演出，忽然前面噔噔噔地跑过来个小伙子，穿了一身油渍渍的蓝色工作服，一把拉住了他：“老程，你原来坐在这里，我找了你好久！”
      “什么事，魏民？”
      “喏，这是我们车间的倡议书，大家决心改修‘草包炉’，向一九六九年献出第一份礼物！”魏民兴奋地讲着。
    程进一听要改修“草包炉”，立刻把鲜红的倡议书接过去，和魏民匆匆忙忙地走出礼堂。
    说来，这还是五年前的事了。厂里来了个总工程师，不知那阵风吹得他脑子一热，就想修座什么“链式炼钢炉”。这个工程师是留洋的“名牌”，厂走资派的掌上明珠，他不听工人的意见，动用了二十多万元资金，花了好几个月的时间，修了这个炼钢炉。可是投入生产后，老是出废品。于是，工人送了它一个绰号：“大草包”。后来，工人们三番两次地提意见，要进行“改炉”，可是走资派根本不理这份茬儿。工人们也不管他那套，照样研究照样干。改炉的方案终于提出来了。可是权在走资派手里，不给料，不给工，硬是卡住不让动。就这样，白白耽搁了五年，炉子没让改。
    路上，程进看着那张大红的倡议书，充满了喜悦，魏民却象放机枪似的，一个劲不停地讲着。正在这时，严家太老师傅从后面赶了上来。
      “严师傅，你不是刚下班吗？怎么……”
    严师傅说：“毛主席号召咱们抓革命，促生产，今晚大家要大战‘草包炉’，向新年献礼，咱这两只手能闲得住吗！”
    严家太老师傅今年快六十岁了。可是，自打文化大革命以来，他真是越活越年青，精力越来越充沛。特别是被选为车间革委会副主任后，常常白天跟班劳动，晚上开会学习，从未觉得累过。
    夜深了。炉前小操场上挤满了人，锣鼓声、欢呼声、鞭炮声此伏彼起，真象庆祝什么节日一样。大家看到程进和严师傅走过来，不约而同地鼓起掌来。
    程进拿着倡议书，向大家表示坚决支持和热烈祝贺。他说：毛主席最近教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席他老人家的指示，句句字字都是我们前进的灯塔。就拿咱们厂来说，建厂十年来，经历了两条路线的激烈斗争。从这座炉子，我们也可以清楚看到，大叛徒刘少奇是怎样疯狂地反对毛主席，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。同志们，这里就是我们捍卫毛主席的革命路线，彻底批判刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的战场！我们要把刘少奇批倒、批臭，叫他永世不得翻身！
    说起大工贼刘少奇推行的那套反革命修正主义路线，严师傅气得眼睛直冒火星。他激动地说，毛主席在党的七届二中全会上明明白白地指出，“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”，这是颠扑不破的伟大真理！可是刘少奇却胡说什么，“工人阶级在一定的时候也可能是不能依靠的”，大肆散布他那反动的“群众落后论”。这不明明是同毛主席革命路线唱对台戏！这不明明是对我们工人阶级的最大污蔑！说穿了，他是想把我们工人整垮，让资本家上台。呸！那是永远也办不到的。正因为有了刘少奇这个黑后台，厂里走资派的狗胆才那么大，什么都是“专家”、工程师说了算，根本没把我们放在眼里，结果不知糟踏了人民多少财产，犯下了多少罪行。这“草包炉”就是一个铁证！
    严师傅的话音刚落，魏民一下蹦到一块大石头上，放开嗓门讲：“党的八届十二中全会公报号召说：‘我们必须抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，把我国的社会主义工业、社会主义农业和一切社会主义事业建设得更加出色。’咱们工人阶级，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想给指路，就能战胜一切敌人，创造一切奇迹！这小小的‘草包炉’咱这大老粗是改定了，非把它改成‘红心炉’不可，用它迎接一九六九年即将出现的新的飞跃，向毛主席献忠心！”
    夜，沸腾了！
    在一片嘹亮的口号声中，严师傅、魏民、程进和工人们一道，怀着对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨和对最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，开始了这场“改炉”战斗！
    黎明的曙光，照耀着广阔的祖国大地。通红通红的钢水，象决了堤似的，终于从“红心炉”中滚滚流出，辉映着每个喜悦的脸膛。光辉灿烂的一九六九年，在胜利的凯歌声中，就要来临了。
