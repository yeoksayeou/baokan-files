The suggestion made by several comrades in the People's Daily to transfer urban primary and secondary schools to factories for management is excellent! Every word and sentence expresses the heartfelt sentiments of our working class. We wholeheartedly endorse and fully support it!

However, some people say, "Factories running schools is good, but they are all greasy-handed rough workers, who may not really be able to do it well." We must remind those who harbor doubts about factories running schools that this way of thinking is completely wrong.

"To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, the working class must take the lead." With the issuance of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive, a team of workers advocating Mao Zedong Thought entered the Anti-Japanese University Seventeenth Middle School in Dandong. As some comrades have said, many of them are "illiterate, greasy-handed rough workers." However, their hearts are the reddest, their eyes the brightest, and they know best how to educate students in a proletarian manner. When they entered the school, it was at a time when the school was responding to the Party Central Committee's call to "face four directions," mobilizing students to go to the mountains and countryside. However, a portion of the students, poisoned by the bourgeois educational line, yearned for city life and were unwilling to go to the countryside to farm, making the "old difficult problem" hard to solve. The workers' propaganda team faced the challenge head-on. From the very beginning, they focused on class education. They did not use textbooks, did not prepare lesson plans, and did not engage in pedantic arguments. Instead, they held the sacred book, pointed to their scars, and recounted their family history, filled with hatred as they fiercely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts, and enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao. One lively political class after another, one sincere and profound sentence after another, greatly educated the students, making them understand the bitterness of their roots and the sweetness of their fruits, understand what books to read, what path to take, and whom to serve. In just one week, the school's "old difficult problem" was solved.

What is the ability of the proletariat to run and manage schools? Practice has proven that those who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, possess the greatest ability to run and manage schools. Factories running schools can thoroughly smash the hegemony of bourgeois intellectuals in schools and can most effectively implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary measures for the proletarian educational line. Therefore, the attitude towards this new thing of the working class running schools is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao. The leader of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Anti-Japanese University Seventeenth Middle School in Dandong, Liaoning, Sun Zhenshen.

    工人阶级完全有能力办好学校
    《人民日报》发表的几位同志关于把城市小学及中学下放到工厂来办的建议提得何等好啊！字字句句说出了我们工人阶级的心里话，我们一千个拥护，一万个赞成！
    可是，有人却说：“工厂办学好是好，可净是油手油脚的大老粗，未必真能办得好。”我们要提醒这种对工厂办学持有怀疑心理的同志，你们这种思想是完全错误的。
    “实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导”。随着毛主席这一光辉指示的发表，一支工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进了丹东抗大十七中学。正如有的同志讲的那样，他们中间很多人是“斗大字识不了两筐，油手油脚的大老粗”。但是，他们心最红，眼最亮，最懂得应该怎样对学生进行无产阶级教育。他们进校的时候，正是学校响应党中央
  “四个面向”的伟大号召，动员学生上山下乡，而一部分学生因受资产阶级教育路线的毒害，留恋城市生活，不愿下乡务农的“老大难”问题迟迟不能解决的时候。工人宣传队知难而进，一开始就狠抓阶级教育。他们不拿课本，不备教案，不咬文嚼字，而是手捧宝书，指着伤疤讲家史，满怀仇恨狠批大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，热情颂扬伟大领袖毛主席。一堂堂生动的政治课，一句句纯朴而深刻的话，给学生们以极大的教育，使他们懂得了苦根甜源，懂得了应该读什么书，走什么路，做什么人的道理。仅一周的时间，学校的“老大难”问题便解决了。
    什么是无产阶级办学治校的能力？实践证明，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线的人，最具有办学治校的能力。工厂办学可以彻底砸烂资产阶级知识分子在学校的“一统天下”，可以最切实地贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级教育路线的革命措施。因此，对待工人阶级办学这一新生事物的态度，就是对待毛主席的根本态度问题。驻辽宁丹东市抗大十七中学工人毛泽东思想宣传队负责人孙振绅
