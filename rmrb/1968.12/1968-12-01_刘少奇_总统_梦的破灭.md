The traitor, secret agent, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi personally directed the production of the reactionary film "Visit to Indonesia," which records Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the revolution during his stay in Indonesia. After watching this reactionary film, we workers, peasants, and soldiers were so angry that our lungs almost burst.

Liu Shaoqi himself could not forget this "visit" and boasted shamelessly, "I was the president of Indonesia for nine days." With this one sentence, he fully exposed his wolfish ambition to usurp the Party and the country.

This number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, once he arrived in Indonesia, threw himself into the arms of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries. Politically, he closely collaborated with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, playing a crucial role in the anti-China chorus. That is all there is to Liu Shaoqi's so-called "presidency" for nine days.

During his stay in Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi followed the leading figures of the big bourgeoisie and reactionary military and political leaders like a fly seeking filth. He indulged in debauchery and revelry, even visiting the rotten presidential bedroom filled with nude paintings. He named a type of orchid after his wife Wang XX and joined the bourgeoisie's extremely frivolous Orchid Society. Liu Shaoqi joyfully exclaimed, "Even when I married Wang XX, it was not as lively as this," "I had a wedding ceremony with Wang XX." How shameless! This was Liu Shaoqi's "presidential" life!

The nine days Liu Shaoqi spent as the "president" in Indonesia were nine days of him shamelessly selling out the interests of our socialist motherland and people. It was nine days of him serving as a faithful dog of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. It was also nine days of his thoroughly rotten bourgeois soul being fully exposed.

This great schemer, Liu Shaoqi, would never be satisfied with being the "president" of Indonesia for just nine days. For a long time, he has been engaged in treacherous activities of betraying the Party and the country, attempting to collaborate with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship, restore capitalism, and realize his absurd dream of becoming the "president" of China.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "No matter how rampant the domestic and foreign reactionaries are (this rampancy is a historical necessity and nothing to be surprised about), we are able to defeat them." This once rampant great traitor has now met his end. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee decided to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently and revoke all his positions within and outside the Party. Liu Shaoqi's "presidential" dream has been completely shattered!

    刘少奇“总统”梦的破灭
    海军战士　王永生　宋清林　丁正和
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇亲手炮制的反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》，记录了刘少奇在印尼期间叛卖革命的滔天罪行。我们工农兵看了这部反动影片，肺都要给气炸了。
    刘少奇自己对这次“访问”念念不忘，津津乐道，恬不知耻地说：“我在印尼当了九天总统”。一句话，就充分暴露了这个大内奸篡党篡国的狼子野心。
    刘少奇这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，到了印尼就一头扎进帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的怀抱里，在政治上同帝、修、反紧密配合，充当反华大合唱的重要角色。刘少奇的所谓“当了九天总统”，如此而已。
    刘少奇在印尼期间，象苍蝇逐臭似地跟在大资产阶级的头面人物、反动军政头目后面，花天酒地，寻欢作乐，甚至参观腐烂透顶的、充满裸体画像的总统卧室，还用他老婆王××的名字去命名兰花，加入资产阶级无聊至极的兰花协会……。刘少奇欣喜若狂地说：“我和王××结婚时也没有这样热闹过”，“同王××补行了婚礼。”真是无耻透顶！这就是刘少奇的“总统”生活！
    刘少奇在印尼做“总统”的九天，是他大肆出卖我们社会主义祖国和人民利益的九天，是他充当帝、修、反忠实走狗十分卖力的九天，也是他腐烂透顶的资产阶级灵魂大暴露的九天。
    刘少奇这个大野心家是决不满足于他在印尼当九天“总统”的，他长期以来就干着叛党、叛国的罪恶勾当，妄图配合帝、修、反颠覆我们的无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，实现他在中国当“总统”的黄粱梦。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不管中外反动派如何猖獗（这种猖獗是历史必然性，毫不足奇），我们是能够战胜他们的。”这个曾经猖獗一时的大工贼，如今已经完蛋。党的八届扩大的十二中全会决定把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务。刘少奇的“总统”梦彻底破灭了！
