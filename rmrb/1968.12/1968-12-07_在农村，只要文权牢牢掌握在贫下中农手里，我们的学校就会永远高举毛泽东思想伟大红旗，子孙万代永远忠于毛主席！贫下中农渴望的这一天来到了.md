In the countryside, as long as the power over education is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, our schools will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and our descendants will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!

The day that the poor and lower-middle peasants have longed for has finally arrived.

Before liberation, at the age of twelve, I and my elder brother were forced to work as long-term laborers for the landlords. We had no right to go to school, let alone manage schools. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us to stand up. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi stubbornly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in the educational field. Under this line's oppression, I personally witnessed many children of poor and lower-middle peasants being unable to enter school, and many being expelled from school. The schools at that time could not cultivate the next generation that the poor and lower-middle peasants needed. Why was this? The fundamental reason was that the power over education was not in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In 1964, the brigade party committee, according to the demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, decided to open a people-run primary school. It was also decided that my daughter, Fengying, would be the teacher. I was overjoyed. I called Fengying to my side and said, "Chairman Mao has given us poor and lower-middle peasants the right to manage schools. You must fight for the honor of us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

In the process of running this school, we were filled with fierce struggles between the two classes and the two lines. At the beginning, there were no classrooms, no desks and chairs, and no textbooks. Should we, like public schools, build brick houses, make desks and chairs, and buy textbooks? Or should we run the school thriftily? We studied Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle when they established the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" in Yan'an. We repaired the classrooms ourselves, made desks out of mud bricks, and when there were no textbooks, we compiled our own. We wrote about heroes like Huang Jiguang, Dong Cunrui, Liu Hulan, and the Red Army's 25,000-mile Long March, crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and printed them ourselves. Who should we enroll? We invited those poor and lower-middle peasant children who did not pass the entrance exam or were expelled from public schools to come to our school. What should the first lesson be? It was "The East Is Red," to let the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants love our great leader Chairman Mao from a young age.

The class enemies hated our poor and lower-middle peasants running a school and tried to sabotage it. They even threatened my daughter, saying, "You have only studied for a few days, and you are already a teacher. This is sheer nonsense and a waste of work points." They saw my daughter often taking the children to work in the brigade and said, "Such a school cannot last long." My daughter was only seventeen years old at that time and had only studied for six years after liberation. She heard these mocking words and felt both angry and sad, and she cried to me at home. At that time, I led her to Chairman Mao's portrait and said, "Child, what are you afraid of! With Chairman Mao supporting us, even if the sky falls, we poor and lower-middle peasants can hold it up! You must take good care of the students and must repel the class enemies' arrogant attacks."

The people-run primary school was tested and tempered in this sharp and complex class struggle and became better and stronger.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Now I deeply feel that: in the countryside, as long as the power over education is firmly in the hands of the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants, our schools will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persist in the socialist path, and our descendants will definitely forever be loyal to Chairman Mao.

    在农村，只要文权牢牢掌握在贫下中农手里，我们的学校就会永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，子孙万代永远忠于毛主席！
    贫下中农渴望的这一天来到了
    解放前，我十二岁就和哥哥一起被迫给地主扛长工，根本没有权利念书，更谈不上管理学校。解放了，毛主席领导我们翻了身，可是大叛徒刘少奇在教育界顽固地推行反革命修正主义教育路线。在这条路线的迫害下，我亲眼看到，有许多贫下中农子弟入不了学，有许多人被开除出学校的大门。那时的学校培养不出我们贫下中农所需要的后一代。这是为什么呢？根本原因，就是文权没有掌握在贫下中农手里。
    一九六四年，大队党支部根据贫下中农的要求，决定开办一所民办小学。还决定让我闺女凤英担任教师。这一来，我可高兴极了。我把凤英叫到跟前对她说：“毛主席给了我们贫下中农管理学校的权利，你可要为咱贫下中农争口气啊！”
    我们在办这所小学的过程中，充满了两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争。开始，没有教室、没有桌椅、没有教材。是象公办小学那样，兴修瓦房、制作桌椅、购买课本呢？还是勤俭办学呢？我们学习了毛主席、林副主席在延安创立“抗大”时的自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，自己动手修补教室，土坯垛成书桌，没有教材，就自己动手编，把英雄黄继光、董存瑞、刘胡兰，以及红军二万五千里长征爬雪山、过草地等等事迹编成教材，自己刻印。招收什么学生呢？把那些没考入正式小学或被正式小学排挤出来的贫下中农子弟请到学校来。第一课讲什么呢？讲的是“东方红”，让贫下中农子弟从小就无限热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席。
    阶级敌人对我们贫下中农办学校恨在心里，妄图拆学校的台。他们竟然威胁我的闺女说：“你自己才念了几天书，还当老师，简直是瞎胡闹、混工分。”他们看到我闺女经常带着孩子们在队里干活，就胡说什么：“这样的学校长不了。”我闺女那年才十七岁，解放后只读了六年书。她听到这些冷嘲热讽的话，心里又气又难过，回到家就对着我哭了起来。当时，我把她领到毛主席像前，对她说：“孩子，怕什么！有毛主席他老人家给咱们撑腰，天塌下来，我们贫下中农也能顶得住！你一定要把学生带好，非把阶级敌人的猖狂进攻打退不可。”
    民办小学就是在这样尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中经受了考验，越办越好，越战越强。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”我现在深深体会到：在农村，只要文权牢牢地掌握在亿万贫下中农手里，我们的学校就会永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持走社会主义道路，我们子孙万代就一定会永远忠于毛主席。
