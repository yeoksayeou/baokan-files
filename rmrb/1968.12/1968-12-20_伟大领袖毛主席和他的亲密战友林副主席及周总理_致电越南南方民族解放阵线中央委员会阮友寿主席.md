The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin and Premier Zhou send a message to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho

Most warmly congratulate the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on its eighth anniversary

The heroic people of South Vietnam have persisted in the people's war, driving the American aggressors into a state of disarray and desperation. The conspiracies and tricks of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists will not succeed against the tested Vietnamese people. The 31 million heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, will persist in the people's war and certainly drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory, achieving the final victory in the war against American aggression for national salvation. The 700 million Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the war against American aggression to the end!

New China News Agency, December 19th

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Mao Zedong, and his close comrade, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Lin Biao, as well as Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai, sent a message today to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, most warmly congratulating the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on its eighth anniversary. The message reads as follows:

Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho:

On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, we, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China, extend our warmest congratulations to the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, who are at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialism.

Over the past eight years, the heroic people of South Vietnam have demonstrated an indomitable revolutionary spirit, persevering in the people's war under extremely difficult conditions, annihilating large numbers of enemy troops, and driving the American aggressors into a state of disarray and desperation. The great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in the war against American aggression have laid the foundation for the ultimate defeat of American imperialism and the realization of the great goal of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately reunifying the country. These victories have also made a significant contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

The practice of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression has once again proven that American imperialism is a paper tiger, externally strong but internally weak. Its power is limited, and it cannot withstand the people's war; it can be completely defeated.

The U.S. imperialists, unwilling to accept their defeat in Vietnam, are resorting to military adventurism and political deception in a desperate struggle. The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to help the U.S. imperialists extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people, is hastening to engage in dirty political deals with the U.S. imperialists. However, all the conspiracies and tricks of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists will not succeed against the tested Vietnamese people.

The Vietnamese people's war against American aggression is a just war. We believe that the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, will persist in the people's war, overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory, achieving the final victory in the war against American aggression for national salvation.

The 700 million Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the war against American aggression to the end!

The final victory will certainly belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!

    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席及周总理
    致电越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会阮友寿主席
    最热烈地祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年
    英雄的越南南方人民坚持人民战争，把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额，走投无路。美帝、苏修的一切阴谋诡计，在久经考验的越南人民面前，是不会得逞的。三千一百万英雄的越南人民，在其伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，坚持人民战争，一定能把美国侵略者赶出越南国土，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    新华社十九日讯　中国人民的伟大领袖、中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东和他的亲密战友、中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪，以及中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，今天致电越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席，最热烈地祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年。电文如下：
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团
    阮友寿主席：
    在越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年的时候，我们代表中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府，向站在反美斗争最前线的越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    八年来，英雄的越南南方人民发扬了英勇顽强、坚韧不拔的革命精神，在非常艰苦的条件下，坚持人民战争，消灭了美伪军和仆从军大量有生力量，把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额，走投无路。越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中取得的伟大胜利，为最后击败美帝国主义，实现解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国的伟大目标，打下了基础，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，作出了贡献。
  越南人民抗美救国战争的实践又一次证明：美帝国主义是外强中干的纸老虎，它的力量是有限的，在人民战争面前，是经不起打的，是完全可以打败的。
    美帝国主义不甘心于它在越南的失败，正在大肆玩弄军事冒险和政治欺骗的反革命两手，进行垂死的挣扎。苏修叛徒集团为了帮助美帝扑灭越南人民的革命烈火，正在加紧同美帝进行肮脏的政治交易。但是，美帝、苏修的一切阴谋诡计，在久经考验的越南人民面前，是不会得逞的。
    越南人民的抗美救国战争是正义的战争。我们相信，三千一百万英雄的越南人民，在其伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，坚持人民战争，一定能够克服前进道路上的困难，把美国侵略者赶出越南国土，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    最后胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！

    中国共产党中央委员会副主席　林彪
    中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
