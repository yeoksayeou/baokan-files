The Jinan Municipal Revolutionary Committee has focused on the struggle between the two lines of education to help urban middle school, high school, and university graduates raise their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, and consciously take the path of integrating with workers and peasants. From January to December 21 of this year, Jinan City has sent a total of 3,400 young people to rural areas to settle down and receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. On the 22nd, under the inspiration of the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, "It is necessary for young intellectuals to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, and university to the countryside and mobilize them. The comrades in the countryside of various places should welcome them," another 820 young people, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, rushed to the countryside, determined to temper themselves into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To hold study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The Jinan Municipal Revolutionary Committee and many middle school-based worker propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, have organized study classes for young people going to the mountains and countryside and for the parents of students, focusing on the active thoughts of some young people who are afraid of hard work and fatigue in the countryside. They have organized and led young people and parents of students to seriously study the history of the two-line struggle within the Party and repeatedly understand the great significance of the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "the final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to integrate with the workers and peasants and actually do so." Through study, the majority of young people have realized that there is also a struggle between the two lines on the issue of going to the mountains and countryside. Whether or not to go to the mountains and countryside and integrate with workers and peasants is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Young people taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants is a concrete manifestation of a thorough break with the revisionist educational line and a thorough break with the bourgeois "self" of the individual. It is a long-term plan to prevent and combat revisionism. After raising their awareness, everyone further established the new trend of going to the mountains and countryside as honorable and cherishing urban comfortable life as shameful.

The broad masses of young people going to the mountains and countryside in Jinan City, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, launched a revolutionary criticism of the reactionary fallacies such as "reading books to become officials," "merging public and private interests," and "going to the countryside for gilding" spread by Liu Shaoqi and his agents. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of young people have an even deeper hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and an even deeper love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They firmly say: "The sea may dry up, and the stones may rot, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will never change; the earth may move, and the mountains may shift, but our resolve to take the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers will never waver."

    济南市革委会狠抓两条路线斗争教育
    革命知识青年自觉地到农村安家落户
    广大知识青年认识到，在上山下乡问题上，也存在着两条路线的斗争。愿意不愿意上山下乡，走不走与工农相结合的道路，是忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题
    据新华社济南二十三日电　济南市革命委员会从狠抓两条路线斗争教育入手，帮助城市广大初中、高中和大学毕业的知识青年提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，自觉地走上与工农相结合的道路。从今年一月到十二月二十一日止，济南市已先后有三千四百多名知识青年到农村安家落户，接受贫下中农再教育。二十二日，在伟大领袖毛主席“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去”的最新指示鼓舞下，又有八百二十名知识青年，满怀革命豪情，奔赴农村，立志把自己锻炼成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”济南市革命委员会和许多中学驻校工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，针对部分知识青年下农村怕苦怕累的活思想，大办有上山下乡知识青年和学生家长参加的毛泽东思想学习班，组织和领导知识青年和学生家长，认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，反复领会伟大领袖毛主席“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合”的教导的伟大意义。通过学习，广大知识青年认识到，在上山下乡问题上，也存在着两条路线的斗争。愿意不愿意上山下乡，走不走与工农相结合的道路，是忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题。知识青年走与工农相结合的道路，是同修正主义教育路线彻底决裂，同资产阶级“私”字彻底决裂的具体表现，是防修反修的百年大计。认识提高后，大家进一步树立了上山下乡为荣，贪恋城市安逸生活为耻的新风尚。
    济南市广大上山下乡知识青年，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为锐利武器，对刘少奇及其代理人散布的“读书做官论”、“公私溶化论”、“下乡镀金论”等反动谬论，展开了革命大批判。通过革命的大批判，广大知识青年对刘少奇及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线更加无比仇恨，对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线更加热爱。他们坚定地说：“海可枯，石可烂，我们忠于毛主席和毛主席革命路线的红心永不变；地可动，山可移，走与工农兵相结合的道路志不移。”
