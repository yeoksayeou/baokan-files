Iraqi and Syrian public opinion has condemned the conspiracy activities of Nixon's "special envoy" in the Middle East. The American imperialists are the most vicious enemies of the people of the world. The Arab people reaffirm their determination to fight against aggression.

BEIRUT, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) — The Iraqi newspaper *Al-Thawra* published an article on Dec. 12 stating that the United States is the chief culprit of international imperialism, and Israel is the watchdog of international imperialism in the Middle East.

The article pointed out that American imperialism supports Zionist aggression in the Arab region. American imperialism provides military, economic, and political aid to Israel in various forms.

The article said: Now, the United States is playing new political tricks, sending Nixon's "special envoy" William Scranton to the Middle East to carry out activities, plotting new American conspiracies to erase the Palestinian issue and spread smoke to continue Israel's aggression and threats against the Arab people.

The article said: "Any resistance to Zionist aggression is resistance to international imperialism, especially to the United States. The United States has done shameful deeds and committed crimes all over the world."

The article said that the new conspiracies planned by the most vicious enemy of the people's freedom and progress, American imperialism, cannot deceive the Arab nation. The article concluded: "The Arab people will always be ready to fight with armed forces to decide their fate and restore the rights of the Arab nation that have been violated."

DAMASCUS, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) — Syrian public opinion continues to condemn the "elected" U.S. President Nixon for sending William Scranton as a "special envoy" to the Middle East to carry out conspiracy activities against the Arab people.

*Al-Thawra* published a commentary saying that Scranton's visit is only to find proposals for Nixon to suppress the resistance of the Arab people and make Arab countries submit to the United States and Zionism.

The commentary broadcast by Damascus Radio on the evening of Dec. 11 said that Scranton's visit has two purposes: to pressure Arab countries to accept the so-called "peaceful solution" to the Middle East problem proposed by the United States; to deceive the people of various Arab countries and cover up the U.S. policy of aggression.

The commentary said: "The Arab people do not expect any change in U.S. policy that is beneficial to the Arab people, because anyone who becomes the U.S. president, whether it is Johnson or Nixon, represents the interests of American monopoly capital and implements the policy of American imperialism."

The commentary concluded: "Scranton's visit will not affect our Arab people's determination to fight for the liberation of occupied lands and against various oppressions and aggressions."

    伊、叙舆论谴责尼克松派“特使”去中东进行阴谋活动
    美帝是世界人民最凶恶的敌人
    重申阿拉伯人民决心为反对侵略而进行战斗
    新华社巴格达十三日电　伊拉克《革命报》十二日发表文章说，美国是世界帝国主义的罪魁祸首，以色列是世界帝国主义在中东的看门狗。
    文章指出，美帝国主义支持以色列犹太复国主义进犯阿拉伯地区。美帝国主义以军事、经济和政治等各种方式援助以色列。
    文章说：现在，美国正在政治上玩弄新的阴谋诡计，把尼克松的“特使”威廉·斯克兰顿派往中东进行活动，策划美国的新阴谋，以勾销巴勒斯坦问题，为以色列继续侵略和威胁阿拉伯人民散布烟幕。
    文章说：“对犹太复国主义的进犯的任何反抗，就是对世界帝国主义、特别是对美国的反抗，美国在世界各地干了可耻的勾当，犯下了罪行。”
    文章说，人民的自由和进步的最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义所策划的新阴谋是骗不了阿拉伯民族的。文章最后说：“阿拉伯人民将始终准备好用武装力量进行决定命运的斗争，以恢复被侵犯的阿拉伯（民族）的权利。”
    新华社大马士革十二日电　叙利亚舆论继续谴责新“当选”的美国总统尼克松派遣威廉·斯克兰顿作为“特使”到中东地区进行反对阿拉伯人民的阴谋活动。
    《革命报》发表评论说，斯克兰顿此行的目的，只不过是为尼克松寻找提出企图镇压阿拉伯人民的反抗并使阿拉伯国家屈从美国和犹太复国主义的联合阴谋的提案。
    大马士革电台十一日晚播送的评论说，斯克兰顿此行有两个目的：压阿拉伯国家接受美国所谓“和平解决”中东问题的计划；欺骗阿拉伯各国人民，掩盖美国的侵略政策。
    评论说：“阿拉伯人民不指望美国的政策会有任何有利于阿拉伯人民的改变，因为任何担任美国总统的人，不管是约翰逊还是尼克松，都是代表美国垄断资本的利益和执行美帝国主义的政策的。”
    评论最后说：“斯克兰顿此行影响不了我们阿拉伯人民为解放被占领的土地和反对种种压迫和侵略而进行战斗的决心。”（附图片）
