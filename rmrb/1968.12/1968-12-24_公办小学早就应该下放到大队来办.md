Public primary schools should have been turned over to the production brigades long ago. In the nineteen years since liberation, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, many public primary schools have been established in rural areas across the country to provide education for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. However, due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi, which was promoted by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, these public primary schools have not truly served the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Take me, for example. I am a child of poor and lower-middle peasants, with no one in my family who has ever attended school. After liberation, our village established a public primary school, and my parents were overjoyed to send me to study there. They encouraged me to study hard and become a cultured new peasant.

In this way, I completed primary school and then went to the town to attend a higher primary school. Two years later, I went to the city to attend middle school.

However, due to the old schools implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, which cultivates successors of the bourgeoisie, the higher the grade I was in, the more detached from reality I became, and the more I looked down on physical labor. When I finished the first semester of the third year of junior middle school and returned home for the holiday, my hometown was busy with autumn harvest distribution. Our production team's accountant was sick and could not promptly calculate the distribution plan. The team members and the team leader, seeing that I was at home, thought that a middle school student would be capable of making the autumn harvest distribution plan, so they proposed that I do the calculations. However, the eight or nine subjects in school had left me confused all day, and I had even forgotten how to do simple addition and subtraction on an abacus. The autumn harvest distribution plan for the production team could not be completed on time. At first, everyone thought I was being modest, but later, when they saw that I really couldn't do it, they said with regret and sadness, "Little Sun, our accountant only studied for two years, but after a few years of tempering, he can calculate without any mistakes. But you, after studying for several years in middle school, can't even calculate, don't go to school anymore, this kind of school is not a place for us poor and lower-middle peasants' children to study."

Seeing me in this state, my parents also did not let me continue to attend senior middle school.

The poor and lower-middle peasants in our village have long hated the schools run by bourgeois intellectuals. We have long hoped to change the situation in the schools! But at that time, because the poor and lower-middle peasants did not have control over cultural affairs, this wish could not be realized.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out wisely: "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." Recently, he has also taught us: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Turning public primary schools over to the production brigades to manage is completely in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and we firmly support it. Only by turning public primary schools over to the production brigades to manage can the power of rural education be permanently in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and only then can revolutionary successors be cultivated.

### 公办小学早就应该下放到大队来办

    公办小学早就应该下放到大队来办
    解放十九年来，在毛主席的正确领导下，为了让我们贫下中农子弟有文化，在农村各地建立了很多公办小学。可是，由于党内一小撮走资派推行了刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，这些公办小学并没有真正为贫下中农服务。
    就拿我来说吧，我是一个贫下中农的子弟，家里世世代代没有人念过书。解放后，我们村上办了所公办小学，我的父母亲欢欢喜喜地把我送进学校学习，并且鼓励我好好读书，将来做个有文化的新农民。
    就这样，我读完了初小，又到市镇去念高小。两年以后，又到城市读中学。
    可是，由于旧学校推行大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，培养的是资产阶级接班人，所以，我读书读的年级越高，越脱离实际，越轻视体力劳动。当我念完初中三年级上学期，放假回家时，家乡正忙着搞秋收分配。我们生产队的会计因病不能及时结算分配方案。社员和队长见我在家，以为中学生有能力来作秋收分配方案，因此提议要我结算。可是，学校里的八、九门功课把我搞得整天晕头转向，打算盘连加减法都忘了，生产队的秋收分配方案表迟迟制不出来。起初大家以为我客气，后来看我实在不行，他们又惋惜又伤心地说：“小孙啊，我们的会计只读了两年书，经过几年的锻炼，就能一分不错地算出来。可你，上了几年中学，倒不会算，以后不要再去读书了，这种学校，不是我们贫下中农子弟学习的地方。”
    父母亲看见我这个样子，也不叫我再去继续读高中了。
    我们村的贫下中农对资产阶级知识分子统治的学校早就恨透了。我们多么希望能改变学校的那种状况啊！但是，那时候，由于贫下中农没有掌握文权，所以这个愿望一直没有实现。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席英明指出：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”最近，他老人家又教导我们说：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”。公办小学下放到大队来办，是完全符合毛泽东思想的，我们坚决支持。公办小学下放到大队办，才能使农村教育大权永远掌握在贫下中农手里，才能培养出革命的接班人。
