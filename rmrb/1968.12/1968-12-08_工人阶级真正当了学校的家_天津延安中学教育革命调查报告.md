The workers of Tianjin Cable Factory, closely following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, dispatched ten outstanding workers to form a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team on September 2, 1968, to take up residence at Tianjin Yan'an Middle School. In the practice of leading the school in the proletarian educational revolution, they deeply felt that the fundamental task of the proletarian educational revolution is to firmly grasp the leadership power of the school in the hands of the working class, and to thoroughly end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. Therefore, with the strong support of the Military Training Team stationed at Yan'an Middle School, they followed the great teachings of Chairman Mao that "the working class must lead everything," and placed Yan'an Middle School under the direct leadership of the Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin Cable Factory. Everyone excitedly said: "Factories running schools, in every way good, is good because the working class truly takes charge of the school, becomes the master of the school, walks the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and cultivates successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Their main practices are:

1. **Leadership of the School by the Working Class**

   The Revolutionary Committee of Yan'an Middle School is under the leadership of the factory's Revolutionary Committee. The deputy director of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Liu Yurui, and ten veteran workers took up positions as the director, deputy directors, and heads of various departments and platoon instructors of the Revolutionary Committee of Yan'an Middle School.

   After the factory took control of the party, government, finance, and cultural affairs of Yan'an Middle School, it immediately drew the high attention of the broad masses of workers. Everyone regarded it as a highly honorable political task entrusted by Chairman Mao. In just one and a half months, the factory's Revolutionary Committee held five full committee meetings to conduct in-depth studies on the issue of the educational revolution in the school. They also organized veteran workers for multiple discussions, forming a situation where everyone cares about the educational revolution and everyone is involved in school construction. This ensured that the working class truly leads the school.

2. **Establishing a Proletarian Teacher Corps That Never Leaves Production and Struggle**

   After cleaning up the class ranks, Yan'an Middle School still had seventy-seven teachers, of whom 42% came from exploitative class backgrounds. These teachers were all products of old schools, lacking experience from the three great revolutionary practices and lacking feelings for workers and peasants. In response to this situation, they followed Chairman Mao's instructions that "intellectuals must be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers" and organized teachers to go to workers, peasants, and soldiers in batches to receive re-education. The first batch sent seven teachers to join the support team to Inner Mongolia for labor; the second batch sent sixteen teachers to work in factories and rural areas with the students; the third batch sent thirty-three teachers to work in the countryside. Additionally, the factory dispatched active learners and practitioners of Mao Zedong Thought, veteran workers with rich class struggle and production experience, and hired impoverished peasants with deep bitterness to serve as full-time and part-time teachers.

   All teachers participate in production labor, gradually achieving the goal of being both teachers and workers or peasants, eliminating the difference between mental and manual labor.

   According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the teacher corps must also continuously "renew and innovate," ensuring that the teacher corps remains loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and forever vigorous.

   As soon as the worker-teachers stepped onto the podium, they made class struggle a main course. They used their personal experiences to angrily denounce the old society and enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao. The veteran workers' personal accounts infected and inspired teachers and students, helping them understand class struggle, understand exploitation, and understand revolution. Because veteran workers have rich experience from the three great revolutionary practices, they also made science courses lively. The "thousandth caliper," which is usually a university course in industrial production, was taught by veteran workers in just two hours, not only teaching students how to use it but also how to repair it. Students said: "In the past, as soon as the class started, it was painful; the more you listened, the more confused you became. Now the teachers' classes are understandable, memorable, and applicable, the more you listen, the more you want to listen."

3. **On Curriculum and Graduation, Enrollment Issues**

   Following Chairman Mao's instructions to "students should focus on learning, but also learn other things, that is, not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie," they streamlined unnecessary courses, set up courses on Mao Zedong Thought, industrial foundation knowledge, agricultural foundation knowledge, military and physical education, and revolutionary arts. Following Chairman Mao's instructions on "combining education with productive labor," they moved the classroom to the front lines of the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The curriculum emphasized Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring the cultivation of reliable successors who are morally, intellectually, and physically excellent and both literate and martial. Now, the revolutionary teachers and students of Yan'an Middle School are undergoing profound changes in their ideological appearance. A student named Zhu Quanzhu, who used to not like to study and often skipped classes, now studies Chairman Mao's works every day under the guidance and education of veteran workers, understanding the meaning of wholeheartedly serving the people. His spiritual appearance has greatly improved. Once, his foot was injured, and his foot was swollen, but he quietly tore up the sick note and continued to work with everyone. He said: "As long as I can go to the factory, I will insist on studying and fighting." Now he has become an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the platoon, not only able to operate the twisting machine independently but also completing the task 30% over quota.

   Enrollment is done according to the national plan and nearby recruitment. Graduates are allocated by the state, facing the border, countryside, mines, and grassroots levels.

4. **Funding Issues**

   Yan'an Middle School's annual budget (including salaries) is 90,000 yuan. However, with only 52 students, in just one month, they created an industrial output value of 165,188 yuan for the state and paid 19,616 yuan in profits. Therefore, the funds can fully achieve self-sufficiency for the factory. In factories with small output and low profits, a portion of the educational funds can be allocated as subsidies, but we believe that most factories can achieve self-sufficiency.

   Although Yan'an Middle School has only taken the first step on the path of "factories running schools," it has already shown unparalleled advantages. From the practice of one and a half months, it can be seen that "factories running schools" will definitely cultivate a new generation of people who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It will fundamentally block the channels for the production of revisionism and create favorable conditions for accelerating the elimination of the three great differences and transitioning to communism.

### 工人阶级真正当了学校的家——天津延安中学教育革命调查报告

    工人阶级真正当了学校的家
    ——天津延安中学教育革命调查报告
    天津市电缆厂紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，于一九六八年九月二日派遣十名优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻了天津延安中学。他们在领导学校进行无产阶级教育革命的实践中深深体会到：无产阶级教育革命的根本任务，是把学校的领导大权牢牢地掌握在工人阶级手里，彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。因此他们在驻延安中学军训团的大力支持下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大教导，把延安中学纳入天津市电缆厂，由厂革命委员会直接领导。大家兴奋地说：“工厂办学校，千好万好，就好在工人阶级真正当了学校的家，做了学校的主人，走的是毛主席指引的路，培养的是无产阶级革命事业接班人。”
    他们的主要做法是：
      一、由工人阶级领导学校
    延安中学革委会归工厂革委会领导。由工厂革委会副主任刘玉璞同志和十名老工人分别担任延安中学革命委员会主任，副主任，以及办事机构负责人和各连指导员。
    工厂掌握了延安中学的党、政、财、文大权后，立即引起广大工人群众高度重视，大家都把它当成毛主席交给的一项极其光荣的政治任务。仅仅一个半月当中，厂革委会先后五次召开全体委员会对学校教育革命问题做了专题研究。又多次组织老工人进行座谈，形成了“人人关心教育革命，个个过问学校建设”的大好局面。使工人阶级领导学校得到了落实。
      二、建立一支永远不脱离生产
  斗争的无产阶级教师队伍
    经过清理阶级队伍，延安中学还有七十七名教员，其中出身于剥削阶级家庭的占百分之四十二；这些教员都是从旧学校培养出来的知识分子，没有经过三大革命实践锻炼，缺乏工农感情。针对这种状况，他们遵照毛主席对知识分子要“由工农兵给他们以再教育”的指示，组织教员分期分批到工农兵中去接受再教育。第一批抽调七名教员随支边青年到内蒙古插队劳动；第二批抽调十六名教员随同学一起到工厂、农村劳动；第三批抽调三十三名教员下放劳动。另外由工厂派出了活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、具有丰富阶级斗争和生产经验的老工人以及聘请苦大仇深的贫下中农担任专职和兼职教员。
    所有的教员，都参加生产劳动，逐步做到既是教员，又是工人、农民，消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。
    根据毛主席的指示，教师队伍也要不断
  “吐故纳新”，使教师队伍永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远朝气蓬勃。
    工人教师一登上讲台就把阶级斗争当成一门主课，他们以自己的亲身经历，愤怒声讨旧社会，热情歌颂毛主席。老工人的现身说法，感染了师生，鼓舞了师生，使大家懂得了阶级，懂得了什么是剥削，懂得了革命。由于老工人有丰富的三大革命实践经验，就把科学知识课也讲活了，在工业生产中经常使用的“千分尺”，过去是大学的课程，而老工人边讲边用，仅仅两个小时，不但教会了学生使用，而且教会了修理。学生们说：“过去一上课就头痛，越听越糊涂；现在的老师上课听得懂，记得住，用得上，越听越爱听。”
  三、关于课程和毕业、招生问题
    遵照毛主席“学生以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的指示，精简不必要的课程，设置毛泽东思想课，工业基础知识课，农业基础知识课，军、体课和革命文艺课。遵照毛主席“教育与生产劳动相结合”的指示，把课堂搬到了阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命实践的第一线，课程突出了毛泽东思想，使培养德、智、体全面发展的能文能武的可靠接班人有了可靠的保证。现在延安中学广大革命师生思想面貌正在发生深刻变化，有个同学叫朱群柱，过去不甚爱学习，经常旷课，在老工人带动和教育下，天天坚持学习毛主席著作，懂得了全心全意为人民服务的道理，精神面貌大改观。一次他的脚扎破了，脚面肿得老高，但他却悄悄地把假条撕掉，仍然和大家一起劳动。他说：“只要能走到工厂，就要坚持学习，坚持战斗。”现在成为连队学习毛主席著作的积极分子，不仅能在绞线机上独立操作，而且超额百分之三十完成任务。
    招生，按国家计划就近招生，毕业生由国家统一分配，面向边疆、面向农村、面向工矿、面向基层。
      四、经费问题
    延安中学每年经费（包括工资）为九万元。而现在五十二个学生，仅一个月的时间就为国家创造工业产值达十六万五千一百八十八元，上缴利润一万九千六百一十六元。因此，经费完全可以达到工厂自给。在产值小、利润低的厂子里，可以从教育经费中抽出一部分做为补助，但我们考虑绝大多数工厂还是可以自给的。
    延安中学虽然在“工厂办学校”的道路上刚刚迈出了第一步，但已显示了无比的优越性。从一个半月实践中看出：“工厂办学校”一定可以培养出无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的一代新人，从根本上堵塞了产生修正主义的渠道，为加速消灭三大差别，过渡到共产主义创造了有利条件。
