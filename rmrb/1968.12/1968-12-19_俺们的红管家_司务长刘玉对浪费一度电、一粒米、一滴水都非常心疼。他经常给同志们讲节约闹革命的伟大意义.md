The motorized transport company of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region firmly remembers Chairman Mao's instructions to "save and make revolution" and "save even more and make revolution." They take thrift as an honor and waste as a shame, launching a mass movement of saving and making revolution. The following are two small stories from their efforts in saving and making revolution.

The radishes pulled from the vegetable field were piled up like a small mountain outside the canteen. The soldiers, seeing the bountiful results of implementing Chairman Mao's May Seventh Directive, were all smiling. At this moment, Quartermaster Liu Yu, pulling two broken jars with a small cart and sweating profusely, walked over. Several soldiers quickly ran over to help. A soldier asked the quartermaster, "What are you pulling these broken jars for?"

"To pickle radishes," the quartermaster replied with a smile. Several soldiers saw that the two broken jars were already in pieces, yet they were still being used to pickle radishes, and they couldn't help but laugh.

The next morning after morning exercises, the soldiers found that the two broken jars the quartermaster had pulled back the day before had been repaired, and they were indeed filled with pickled radishes. They all stared in amazement. At this time, the quartermaster said to them, "Look, these two broken jars, after being repaired, can still be used, right? Chairman Mao teaches us to 'save and make revolution.' Thrift is our army's glorious tradition, and we must never abandon it! Buying a new jar, of course, is more convenient, but it costs several dozen yuan. Repairing these two broken jars not only saves the people several dozen yuan, but more importantly, it plugs the loophole of wasteful thinking in our minds. Only in this way can we ensure that we always march forward along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" The quartermaster's heartfelt words struck a chord with the soldiers, making everyone further understand the great significance of saving and making revolution.

Quartermaster Liu Yu always remembers the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "ensure that comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard work and plain living." He works diligently and practically. He is very concerned about wasting even a degree of electricity, a grain of rice, or a drop of water. He hangs a small sign with the words "save and make revolution" on every light switch in the entire company. Every night after lights out, after the comrades have fallen asleep, he still walks around the rooms, turning off any lights that are left on and tightening any dripping water pipes. He often lectures the comrades in the kitchen about the great significance of saving and making revolution, using Mao Zedong Thought to guard this crucial link. The comrades all affectionately call him "our red housekeeper."

专栏：节约闹革命的小故事

    “俺们的红管家”
    司务长刘玉对浪费一度电、一粒米、一滴水都非常心疼。他经常给同志们讲节约闹革命的伟大意义
    北京部队某部汽车连牢记毛主席“要节约闹革命”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的教导，以勤俭节约为荣，以铺张浪费为耻，开展了群众性的节约闹革命运动。下面就是他们节约闹革命中的两则小故事。
    从菜地拉回来的萝卜，象小山一样堆在食堂门外。战士们看着自己落实毛主席“五·七”指示取得的丰硕成果，个个喜笑颜开。这时，司务长刘玉用小车拉着两个破缸满头大汗地走来，几个战士立刻跑过去帮忙。一个战士问司务长：“拉这破缸干什么？”
  “腌萝卜呗。”司务长笑着回答。几个战士看到两个破缸已经碎成十几块，还要用来腌萝卜，都禁不住笑了。
    第二天早上出操回来，战士们发现司务长昨天拉回来的两个破缸已经修好，里面真的腌满了萝卜，都看着发楞。这时司务长对他们说：你们看，这两口破缸修一修不是照样能用吗？毛主席教导我们“要节约闹革命”，勤俭节约是我军的光荣传统，我们可千万不能丢掉啊！买一口新缸，当然省事，可是要花几十元钱。修好这两口破缸，不仅为人民节约几十元钱，更重要的是堵住了我们思想上铺张浪费的漏洞，只有这样，才能保证我们永远沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进！司务长语重心长的一席话，说到了战士们的心坎上，使大家进一步明确了节约闹革命的伟大意义。
    司务长刘玉时刻牢记伟大领袖毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，工作勤恳踏实。他对浪费一度电、一粒米、一滴水都非常心疼。他在全连每一个灯绳上都拴上一个“要节约闹革命”的小语录牌。每天晚上熄灯后，同志们都睡着了，他还要围着房子转一圈，把没关的灯关上，把滴水的水管拧好。他经常给炊事班的同志们讲节约闹革命的伟大意义，用毛泽东思想把好伙房这一关。同志们都亲切地称他是“俺们的红管家”。
