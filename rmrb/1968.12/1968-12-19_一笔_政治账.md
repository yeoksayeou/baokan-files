    A Political Account

    This day was the car maintenance day for the motorized company. New soldier Zhao Guoqiang and his squad leader Liang Xiwu were maintaining a new "Liberation" brand truck. Little Zhao used a basin to wash some oil-stained parts with a bit of gasoline. After washing, he casually poured out a little dirty oil. Seeing this, Liang Xiwu said regretfully, "Ah! Why didn't you pour it into the waste oil barrel?" Little Zhao nonchalantly replied, "Just a little bit of waste oil, not worth the trouble. Squad leader, haven't you heard? The Daqing Oilfield produces a lot of oil! This little bit of oil, what's the big deal?"

    Liang Xiwu spoke meaningfully, "This little bit of oil isn't much, but we can't just calculate the economic cost and ignore the political implications!" After saying this, Liang Xiwu went on to talk about how the Red Army ate grass roots and tree bark during the Long March, how Wang Jie picked up toothpaste tubes, and how Sun Leyi picked up rice grains. When the squad leader mentioned picking up rice grains, it reminded Little Zhao of a memory.

    Little Zhao's father, who had passed away, was the political commissar of the county's armed forces department. He bravely sacrificed his life to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He had been in the revolution for over twenty years, always maintaining a frugal lifestyle. Once, Little Zhao's younger brother dropped some rice grains on the table while eating. His father told the younger brother to pick them up and eat them. Guoqiang said on the side, "Just a few rice grains, they won't even fill a tooth gap!" His father sternly pointed out, "These few rice grains may seem insignificant, but throwing them away means throwing away proletarian politics and the glorious tradition of hard work and self-reliance cultivated by Chairman Mao!"

    Thinking of this, Little Zhao lowered his head in regret.

    Seeing that he had realized his mistake, Liang Xiwu pulled him aside and said, "Little Zhao, this little bit of oil may seem insignificant, but if you pour it out today and pour it out tomorrow, bit by bit, you'll pour away our army's old tradition of hard work and simplicity. Over time, we will gradually change and become revisionists, and the country won't be safe. The hard-won country by the revolutionary forerunners will be lost!"

    Little Zhao raised his head and firmly said, "Squad leader, I've understood this political account. I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teaching to 'save and make revolution' and learn from the revolutionary forerunners to make revolution through hard work and self-reliance!"

    一笔“政治账”
    这天，是汽车连的车场日。新战士赵国强同班长梁希武保养一台“解放”牌新汽车。小赵用脸盆盛了点汽油，洗了洗满是油泥的零件，洗完后，顺手把一点点脏油泼了。梁希武见了，心疼地说：“哎呀！你怎么不把它倒进废油桶呢？”小赵满不在乎地说：“这么一点儿废油，不值得跑一趟。班长，你没听说，大庆油田生产的石油可多了！这么一点儿油，算得了什么？”梁希武意味深长地说：“这点儿油是不多，可我们不能只算经济账，不算政治账呵！”说完，梁希武接着又从红军长征时吃草根、树皮，讲到王杰拾牙膏皮，孙乐义拣米粒等等。班长一讲到拣米粒，勾起了小赵一段回忆。
    小赵的父亲，生前是县武装部政委，为保卫毛主席的革命路线，英勇地牺牲了。他参加革命二十多年，一直保持艰苦奋斗的生活作风。有一次小赵的弟弟吃饭把饭粒掉在桌子上，父亲叫弟弟拣起来吃了。国强在一边说：“这么几个米粒，还填不满牙缝呢！”父亲严肃地指出：“别看这几个米粒不起眼儿，但丢掉它就是丢掉了无产阶级政治，丢掉了毛主席培育的艰苦奋斗的光荣传统！”
    想到这里，小赵难过地低下了头。
    梁希武见他认识了错误，拉着他的手说：“小赵，别看一点儿油不起眼儿，今天泼一点儿，明天泼一点儿，泼来泼去，就会把我军艰苦朴素的老传统泼掉。时间长了，我们就会慢慢变质、变修，革命前辈用血汗换来的江山，就会付之东流！”
    小赵抬起头来，坚定地说：
  “班长，这笔政治账我算清了。我一定牢记毛主席‘要节约闹革命’的教导，学习革命前辈，艰苦奋斗闹革命！”
