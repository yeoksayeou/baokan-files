As the Albanian people joyfully celebrate the 24th anniversary of their liberation, the revolutionary friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania has further developed and strengthened.

In their telegram of congratulations to Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrades Mehmet Shehu and Spiro Koleka on the occasion of the national day, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou solemnly declared: "The 700 million Chinese people, who have undergone the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to be the staunch rear guard of the Albanian people. In any circumstances and at any time, we will firmly support your struggle against imperialism and revisionism. Let us, the two parties, the two peoples, the two governments, and the two armies, advance hand in hand, mutually inspiring, supporting, and learning from each other in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their running dogs!" It can be asserted that if the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their running dogs dare to touch a single hair of Albania, the only thing awaiting them will be a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure.

At the invitation of the Albanian people, a Chinese party, government, and military delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng participated in the celebrations of the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation and was warmly welcomed by the Albanian people. The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, personally received the Chinese delegation. Our delegation had extensive and cordial contacts with the Albanian people. Wherever they went, the shouts of "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" and "Mao Zedong-Enver!" echoed through the skies. This most vividly and concretely embodied the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between our two parties, peoples, and armies.

At the celebrations and welcoming rallies in Tirana, the Albanian party, government, and military leaders enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples, warmly congratulated the Chinese people on their great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and emphasized the historical and international significance of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This is a great encouragement and inspiration to the Chinese people who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, as Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out, "whether in good times or difficult times, we will always be together like brothers, because our unity and friendship are built on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism." We believe that the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania will continue to develop and flourish in our common great struggle.

    中阿人民革命友谊不断得到发展加强
    当阿尔巴尼亚人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝解放二十四周年的光辉节日的时候，中阿两党和两国人民的革命友谊又得到了进一步的发展和加强。
    毛主席、林副主席和周总理在给霍查同志和列希、谢胡同志的节日祝贺电报中再一次郑重地宣告：“经过无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将坚定不移地支持你们的反帝反修斗争。让我们两党、两国人民、两国政府、两国军队在反对美帝、苏修及其走狗的共同斗争中，互相鼓舞，互相支持，互相学习，携手前进！”可以断言，如果美帝、苏修及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等待着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    由黄永胜同志率领的中国党政军代表团应邀到阿尔巴尼亚参加解放二十四周年庆祝活动，受到阿尔巴尼亚人民极为热情的欢迎。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲自接见了中国党政军代表团。我国代表团同阿尔巴尼亚人民进行了广泛的亲切的接触，他们所到之处，“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“毛泽东—恩维尔！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。这最集中地、最生动地体现了我们两党、两国人民和两国军队的革命友谊和战斗团结。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政军领导人在地拉那的庆祝集会和欢迎集会上，热情地颂扬阿中人民的战斗友谊，热烈地祝贺中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利，强调指出中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的历史意义和国际意义。这对正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民是极大的支持和鼓舞。
    中阿两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，正如恩维尔·霍查同志指出的，“不管在美好的日子里还是困难的日子里，我们将象亲兄弟一样永远在一起，因为我们的团结和友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的牢固基础上的。”我们相信，中阿两国人民的革命友谊，在我们的共同的伟大斗争中，必将不断发展，万古长青。
