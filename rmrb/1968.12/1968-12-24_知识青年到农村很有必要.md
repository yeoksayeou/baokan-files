The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us again: "It is necessary for intellectual youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high, senior high, and college to the countryside, and mobilize them. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Chairman Mao's words are all truth, each word shines with golden light, striking at the heart of us intellectual youth. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and encouragement for us intellectual youth. Let us shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

I was originally a junior high school graduate from Yinchuan City. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, this year I firmly took the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and went to join the production team in the Sixiang Mountain area where Chairman Mao led the Red Army during the Long March. I was able to win the battle in the struggle between "public" and "private" during the graduation assignment, completely due to Chairman Mao's guidance.

During the graduation assignment, I thought: After all, there are four "orientations" for graduation assignments (facing the countryside, facing factories and mines, facing the grassroots, facing the border areas), it doesn't have to be the countryside. If there is an assignment to a factory, I will go to the factory. But then I thought, I am the leader of the class, how can I not lead the way to go to the mountains and countryside...

Just as my struggle between "public" and "private" was intense, the PLA comrades used Mao Zedong Thought to give me vivid class education, hoping that I would follow Chairman Mao and never fall behind. Back at home, my father and mother told me stories of the revolutionary forerunners' arduous struggles and heroic deeds, and used family history to educate me on bitter memories and sweet memories. My brother also wrote a letter encouraging me to listen to Chairman Mao's words and go to the most arduous places to temper my heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao. During this period, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "The Orientation of the Youth Movement" and reviewed Chairman Mao's related instructions. Chairman Mao said: "All such intellectuals who can go to work in the countryside should be happy to go there. The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated my heart, and my thoughts became clear. Later, my comrades and I, carrying the shining red book, with revolutionary enthusiasm and aspirations, came to settle down in the Xingsheng Commune of Jingyuan County at the foot of the Sixiang Mountain.

When I first came to the countryside, I was not used to the life. At this time, the majestic and magnificent scene of the great leader Chairman Mao leading the Red Army to cross the Sixiang Mountain appeared before my eyes. I silently recited Chairman Mao's great poem, "Not reaching the Great Wall is not a hero, counting the journey of twenty thousand li," and suddenly felt full of energy, eliminating the thoughts of fearing hardship and fatigue.

Under the education and help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I learned many things that I could never learn in the classroom. The poor and lower-middle peasants taught me how to farm during the day and organized bitter-sweet memory meetings for us at night, making us further understand the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, deepening our limitless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. I made up my mind: I will read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and walk the revolutionary path for a lifetime.

In the mountainous countryside, I saw many poor and lower-middle peasants and their children who were illiterate, but they had a heart of limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao. I gave them the red book and Chairman Mao's badges that I brought, often read Chairman Mao's quotations to the poor and lower-middle peasants, taught them to read and sing revolutionary songs. I gradually established class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised me, saying: "Little Bu is a good revolutionary descendant."

Although I have not been in the countryside for long, I have already tasted the sweetness. I sincerely hope that all revolutionary intellectual youth will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to the vast world of the countryside, receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and temper themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    知识青年到农村很有必要
    宁夏六盘山区泾源县兴盛公社下乡知识青年　布晓明
    伟大领袖毛主席最近又一次教导我们：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”毛主席的话句句是真理，字字闪金光，说到了我们知识青年的心坎上。这是毛主席他老人家对我们知识青年的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。让我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    我原来是银川市的一个初中毕业生。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，今年我坚定地走上了与工农兵相结合的道路，到毛主席率领工农红军长征时经过的六盘山插队落户了。我能在毕业分配的这场“公”与“私”的斗争中打了胜仗，完全是毛主席他老人家教导的结果。
    毕业分配时，我曾想：反正毕业分配有四个“面向”（面向农村，面向工矿，面向基层，面向边疆），不一定就让我面向农村吧！如果有分配到工厂的，我就去工厂。可是又一想，我是班里的头头，不带头上山下乡怎么行？……
    正当我“公”“私”斗争十分激烈的时候，解放军同志用毛泽东思想对我进行了生动的阶级教育，希望我紧跟毛主席，永远不掉队。回到家里，爸爸、妈妈又给我讲述了当年革命老前辈艰苦奋斗的英雄事迹，并用家史对我进行忆苦思甜教育。哥哥也来信鼓励我，要我听毛主席的话，到最艰苦的地方去锻炼无限忠于毛主席的红心。在这期间，我反复学习了毛主席的《青年运动的方向》，重温了毛主席的有关教导。毛主席说：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光照亮了我的心，我的思想豁然开朗。随后，我和战友们带上金光闪闪的红色宝书，满怀革命的豪情壮志，来到六盘山下的泾源县兴盛公社安家落户了。
    刚来到农村时，生活不习惯。这时，我的眼前就出现了伟大领袖毛主席率领工农红军健步跨越六盘山的宏伟壮丽的图景。我默默背诵毛主席的伟大诗篇“不到长城非好汉，屈指行程二万”，顿时感到浑身是劲，怕苦怕累的念头消除了。
    在贫下中农的教育帮助下，我学到了很多在课堂里根本学不到的东西。贫下中农白天把着手教我种田，晚上给我们组织忆苦思甜会，使我们进一步懂得了旧社会的苦，体会到新社会的甜，更加深了我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和无限忠诚。我下定决心：读一辈子毛主席的书，走一辈子革命的路。
    在山区农村，我看到许多贫下中农和他们的子女不识字，可是他们有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，我便把带去的红色宝书和毛主席像章送给贫下中农，经常为贫下中农念毛主席语录，教他们识字和唱革命歌曲。我和贫下中农逐步建立了阶级感情。贫下中农夸我说：“小布这丫头是革命的好后代。”
    我到农村的时间虽然不长，但已经尝到了甜头。我衷心希望一切革命的知识青年，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农村这个广阔的天地里来，接受贫下中农再教育，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
