Not long ago, the Shenyang Military Region sent personnel to the Altay area of Xinjiang to transport a batch of military horses. Upon hearing this news, the impoverished Kazakh herdsmen regarded it as an excellent opportunity to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao and contribute to the socialist motherland. They traversed mountains and valleys to bring the horses.

One commune provided military horses, with 73% of them being first-class. The soldiers who came to receive the horses were already very satisfied. However, after the impoverished herdsmen learned of this, they held an emergency meeting and decided to replace the remaining horses with first-class ones as well.

When the soldiers set off on their journey, the elderly Kazakh herdsmen, like sending their sons to join the army, patted their beloved horses and said with great enthusiasm, "Go! For the defense of Chairman Mao, for the defense of the socialist motherland, and for the defense of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, go and fight!" They also specially dispatched the best herdsmen to assist the soldiers in escorting the military horses.

After a 20-day arduous journey, more than 120 horses were driven to a grassland near Baiquan Spring. According to the original plan, the herd should have stayed there for the night. However, upon inspection, there was only a small stream of water. The soldiers thought, "This little water will be drunk by over a hundred horses in one night. In a few days, the commune's herdsmen will come to cut grass and it will be useless." To leave convenience for the masses, they continued to travel in the dark.

If there were no strong winds, the nights on the Gobi Desert would be very quiet. However, tonight was different. The hungry and thirsty herd occasionally let out a series of neighs. This made the soldiers especially alert. They went into the herd and spent the night with the military horses. However, due to the horses' extreme hunger and thirst, they suddenly scattered and ran away at dawn.

The herd scattered across the vast Gobi Desert, leaving only a few people in the small escort team to find them.

Just as everyone was in a state of panic, a passing truck driver told them, "Come! I'll take you to the White Salt Flats. The oil workers of the Karamay Oil Field will definitely provide great support!"

The workers at the White Salt Flats drilling site heard that the military horses had scattered and rushed to the command center to participate in the search for the horses. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people.' The difficulties of the People's Liberation Army are our difficulties. No matter how large the Gobi Desert is, we must find the horses back!" After analyzing the situation of the horses scattering, they immediately dispatched cars in three directions to search. At the same time, they notified nearby drilling teams, farms, and people's communes via telephone. With the help of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and impoverished herdsmen of various ethnic groups, most of the military horses were found by noon.

One wave had not yet subsided, and another wave arose! The herdsmen Tuohutale and Tuohutahan, who helped escort the military horses, went missing during the search for the horses. The soldiers of the small escort team were very anxious! Everyone was so concerned about the safety of their class brothers! They organized forces to search everywhere while reporting to their superiors. The responsible comrades of the Shenyang Military Region's horse-receiving leading group immediately instructed, "Rescuing class brothers is the most important! We must make every effort to find them!"

"Rescuing class brothers is the most important!" Before dawn, the comrades of the small escort team and the oil workers drove cars to the Gobi Desert.

At this time, Tuohutale and Tuohutahan, who were searching for the herd, had already lost their way in the vast Gobi Desert. In August, the sun was scorching, and the endless sand and stones were like flames burning people. They had no water to drink, sweat poured down, and their mouths were as dry as fire. However, their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao made them incredibly brave in the face of difficulties. To find the military horses, they sang the "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory" song and bravely moved forward, finally finding the soldiers.

On the evening of August 21, the scattered herd was gathered on a grassland near the drilling site. However, less than an hour after arriving at the grassland, the startled herd suddenly scattered again. The news spread quickly, and in an instant, the entire drilling site, from top to bottom, from workers to family members, everyone was concerned and busy. Large and small cars roared to life, and all the telephones were quickly dialing. Soon, all the drilling teams, farms, and people's communes within a radius of over 200 miles in the White Salt Flats area were notified. A net was quickly set up on the vast Gobi Desert to capture the horses. Soon, the startled horses were all found again.

The small escort team drove the military horses, enduring countless hardships, and received warm care from people of various ethnic groups along the way, finally driving the horses to Urumqi.

On September 16, a train loaded with military horses departed. The speeding train! You are not only carrying military horses, but also something more precious! This is the greatest loyalty of the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and impoverished herdsmen of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang to the great leader Chairman Mao, and the deepest proletarian feelings for the People's Liberation Army!

    天山青松根连根　军民永远心连心
    ——新疆各族工人、贫下中农和贫苦牧民帮助寻找军马的故事
    不久以前，沈阳军区派人到新疆阿勒泰区接运一批军马。哈萨克贫苦牧民听到这个消息，都把这件事看成是向毛主席献忠心，为社会主义祖国贡献力量的大好机会。他们翻山越岭赶来了马群。有一个公社提供的军马，一等一级的达到百分之七十三。接马的解放军同志已是很满意了。可是贫苦牧民们知道以后，却为此召开了紧急会议，决定把其余的也都换成一等一级的马。
    当解放军同志起程赶路的时候，那些哈萨克老牧民们就象送子参军一样，用手拍着他们心爱的马，满怀豪情地说：“去吧！为了保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，去战斗吧！”他们还特意派了最好的牧工，帮助解放军同志护送军马。
    经过二十天的长途艰苦跋涉，一百二十多匹马被赶到了百口泉附近的一个草场。按照原定计划，马群应该在这里过夜。可是，一查看，这里只有很小的一沟水。解放军同志们想：
  “这点水，一百多匹马一夜就喝光了。过几天公社的牧民们来打草该没有用的了。”为了把方便留给群众，他们又摸黑赶了一段路程。
    如果没有大风，戈壁滩上的夜是非常宁静的。可是今天却不同，又饥又渴的马群不时地发出阵阵嘶叫声。这使得解放军同志特别提高了警惕。他们来到马群里，伴着军马过夜。但是，由于马过于饥渴，在天快明的时候突然惊群，四下逃散了。
    马群逃散在茫茫的戈壁滩上，叫只有几个人的赶马小分队到哪里去找？
    正在大家心如火焚的时刻，一个过路的汽车司机同志对他们说：“走！我拉你们到白碱滩去，克拉玛依油矿的石油工人一定会大力支援！”
    白碱滩石油钻井处的工人们听说军马失散了，纷纷跑到生产指挥部要求参加找马战斗。他们说：“毛主席教导我们：
  ‘没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。’解放军的困难，就是我们的困难。戈壁滩再大，我们也要把马找回来！”人们对马群失散的情况进行分析之后，立即出动汽车分三路去找。同时用电话通知附近的钻井队、农场以及人民公社。在各族工人、贫下中农和贫苦牧民的帮助下，到中午就把大部分军马找到了。
    一波未平，一波又起！帮助护送军马的牧工托乎塔尔和托乎塔汉，在找马过程中失踪了。解放军小分队的同志们多么不安啊！大家是多么地为阶级兄弟的安全担心啊！他们一面组织力量四出寻找；一面向上级报告。沈阳军区接马领导小组的负责同志立即指示：“营救阶级兄弟最要紧！要尽最大努力把人找到！”
      “营救阶级兄弟最要紧！”天不明，小分队的同志就和石油工人们开着汽车到戈壁滩去了。
    这时，找寻马群的托乎塔尔和托乎塔汉，已经在大戈壁滩上转了向。八月的戈壁滩，烈日当空，无边的砂石就象冒着火苗一般烤人。他们没有水喝，汗水直流，口干得象冒火。可是，对毛主席的无限忠诚，使他们在困难面前产生了惊人的勇敢。为了找到军马，他们高唱着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌，奋勇向前，终于找到了解放军同志。
    八月二十一日傍晚，失散的马群全部集中到钻井处附近的一片草滩上。可是，来到草滩还不到一个小时，受惊马群又忽地一下向四下逃散了。消息迅速传开，刹那间，整个钻井处从上到下，从职工到家属，每一个人都在关心着，奔忙着。大小汽车在轰??地发动，所有的电话机都在急速地摇转，很快就把白碱滩地区方圆二百多里内所有的钻井队、农场、人民公社都通知到了。在茫茫的戈壁滩上，迅即布下了一个擒马的天罗地网。时过不久，又把惊马全都找了回来。
    小分队的同志赶着军马，历尽千辛万苦，沿途受到各族人民的热情照顾，终于把马赶到了乌鲁木齐。
    九月十六日，一列满载着军马的火车开动了。飞奔前进的列车啊！你满载的不只是军马，还有更珍贵的东西！这就是新疆各族工人、贫下中农、贫苦牧民对伟大领袖毛主席最大的忠心，对人民解放军最深厚的无产阶级感情！
