The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." Now, as we review Chairman Mao's great teachings, recalling the course of the two-line struggle during the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, we feel particularly close to them.

After national liberation, we broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following the correct course charted by Chairman Mao, successively organized mutual aid teams and cooperatives. The agricultural collectivization movement is a socialist revolutionary movement of world-historical significance in China's countryside. The traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi harbored a deep hatred for the agricultural collectivization movement. He and his accomplices, behind Chairman Mao's back, shouted "anti-over-fulfillment" and ordered the massive cutting of cooperatives, attempting to turn the wheel of history backward and restore capitalism in the countryside. This evil wind blew to Luoning, and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the county and commune party organizations followed suit, suppressing the broad revolutionary masses who insisted on the socialist road. One of the cooperatives we established was organized by 21 households of old poor peasants. It had only been half a year since its establishment, and during the wheat harvest of 1955, the county sent a traitor who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks to disband the cooperative. We demanded to continue, but he arrogantly replied, "No, it must be disbanded!" He then convened a meeting of the cooperative members to "mobilize" everyone to withdraw. The members were very dissatisfied. Jia Tongzhou, who had suffered greatly in the old society, wept as he denounced, "In the old society, I was starving to death. Now that we have finally organized to produce together, we have a big cart and bought livestock, and now you want to disband the cooperative and go back to individual farming. I won't withdraw!" Several poor peasants who had suffered under the landlords' exploitation cursed this man fiercely. This man, enraged and ashamed, falsely accused the members of being "anti-party" and "anti-government," saying, "Whether you want to disband or not, you must disband. This is the decision of higher authorities." He forcibly disbanded the cooperative.

We poor and lower-middle peasants are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most resolute in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the most steadfast in walking the socialist road. Although our cooperative was forced to disband, the members' hearts did not disperse, and the collective property was not divided at all, preparing to reorganize. Two months later, Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" was published. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were elated and spread the news. Everyone resolutely declared, "We will defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and definitely run the cooperative well." From then on, the members more firmly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. During the period when China's national economy encountered temporary difficulties, although Liu Shaoqi again spread the black wind of "contracting production to households" and "dividing land to households," the poor and lower-middle peasants, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, saw through his tricks and resolutely resisted, ensuring the consolidation and development of the collective economy.

Recently, Chairman Mao taught us, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly lectured. It is not enough to lecture to a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know." Reviewing the history of the two-line struggle during the establishment of cooperatives has further raised my awareness of the line struggle. I will, together with all the revolutionary masses of the brigade, seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seriously study the reissued epoch-making brilliant document "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," raise the awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle to a new height, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation proposed in the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. We will thoroughly criticize and purge Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    刘少奇是大砍合作社的祸首
    河南省洛宁县赵村公社东上大队革委会主任　贾全喜
    伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会上指出：
  “在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”现在重温毛主席这一伟大教导，联想起我们办农业合作社时两条路线斗争的经过，感到格外亲切。
    全国解放以后，我们广大贫下中农按照毛主席指引的正确航向，先后组织起了互助组、合作社。农业合作化运动是我国农村具有世界历史意义的社会主义革命运动。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，对农业合作化运动恨得入骨。他和他的同伙背着伟大领袖毛主席，大叫“反冒进”，下令大砍合作社，妄图把历史的车轮拉向后转，在农村复辟资本主义。这股邪风吹到洛宁后，我们县、社的党内一小撮走资派也跟着镇压坚持走社会主义道路的广大革命群众。我们办的一个合作社，是二十一户老贫农组织起来的。办起刚半年，一九五五年麦收时，县里派来了一个混入革命队伍的叛徒，来解散合作社。我们提出了继续办下去的要求，他却横蛮地回答：“不行，必须解散！”他又召集社员会，“动员”大家退社。社员们都很不满。在旧社会受尽折磨的贾同舟流着泪控诉说：“在旧社会，我饿的死去活来，现在好容易组织起来生产，置了大车，买了牲口，又叫散社变单干，我不退！”有几位过去受尽地主剥削的贫农，气得大骂这个家伙。这个家伙恼羞成怒，胡说社员“反党”、“反政府”，“不愿散还得散，这是上级的‘决定’”。他硬把合作社解散了。
    我们贫下中农，对毛主席最忠，执行毛主席的革命路线最坚决，走社会主义道路最坚定。我们合作社虽然被迫解散了，但是社员的心没散，集体财产一点没有分，准备再组织起来。过了两个月，毛主席《关于农业合作化问题》的光辉著作发表了。广大贫下中农扬眉吐气，奔走相告。大家坚决表示：“我们要保卫毛主席的革命路线，一定要把社办好。”从这以后，社员们更加坚定地捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。在我国国民经济遭受暂时困难时期，尽管刘少奇又刮起了“包产到户”、“分田到户”的黑风，但是无限忠于毛主席的贫下中农识破了他的诡计，并且坚决进行了抵制，保证了集体经济的巩固和发展。
    最近，毛主席教导我们说：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”重新学习办社中两条路线斗争的历史，使我进一步提高了路线斗争的觉悟。我要和全大队革命群众一道，认真学习毛主席的这个最新指示，认真学习重新发表的划时代的光辉文献——《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟提到新的高度，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，胜利完成党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报所提出的斗、批、改任务，彻底批判和肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
