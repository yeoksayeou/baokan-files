In accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," the Dazhai Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of the Dazhai people. In January 1968, they established the Dazhai Health School, which is currently training doctors for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

This health school has four distinctive features:

First, it has many children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Out of the 26 students in the school, 25 are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Among them, four are graduates of agricultural middle schools, one is a primary school student, and the rest are graduates of elementary schools. The youngest is 15 years old, and the oldest is 20. They say, "Although we are young, we have a red heart dedicated to studying medicine for the poor and lower-middle peasants and serving them wholeheartedly."

Second, the students engage in both farming and medical work, never separating themselves from labor. When they came to school, each student carried a copy of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," a shoulder pole with a basket, a hoe, a shovel, and their own food, vegetables, and bedding. Now, when they return to their villages, one shoulder carries a basket and the other a medical kit. They happily say, "Our hands are calloused, our legs are muddy, we work in the fields, and we go door-to-door to treat illnesses."

Third, this school does not rely on state funding, collective subsidies, or personal expenses from students. It insists on self-reliance and follows the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. The students proudly say, "We learn from the Dazhai people, struggling hard, which is much more glorious than living in buildings provided by the state and receiving state subsidies!"

Fourth, this school has no full-time teachers, no thick textbooks, and no "standard" classrooms. They are taught by doctors from the commune health center, compile their own lesson plans, and learn and apply in practice, seeing immediate results. The students say, "This way of learning is the easiest to remember and understand, and we can use what we learn right away."

The poor and lower-middle peasants welcome such a health school. They happily say, "The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style health school trains semi-farmers and semi-doctors who serve the people wholeheartedly. Now, we peasants have our own doctors."

Starting from Scratch, Labor Every Day

On January 4, 1968, 21 brigades of the Dazhai Commune sent their selected students to the Dazhai Health School. At that time, the school had nothing. The students' first lesson upon arrival was to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles," focusing on the topic "For whom do we study, and for whom do we serve?" Everyone said, "We are here to represent the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants and are entrusted by the party branch. We must study for the revolution, for the poor and lower-middle peasants, to change the situation of lack of doctors and medicine in rural areas. No matter how great the difficulties, we are not afraid! We must temper ourselves in harsh environments and train ourselves to be successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

The school had no buildings, so they found four dilapidated earthen caves. Initially, the caves were uninhabitable, so they borrowed fire from the locals to cook and slept on the kangs of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Later, they cleaned out the animal dung and weeds from the caves, repaired the collapsed areas, and patched the holes with mud. Thus, the four dilapidated earthen caves became the school's classrooms, dormitories, and kitchens.

There were no blackboards, so they used bedboards as substitutes; there were no desks, so they found cardboard boxes from the supply and marketing cooperative to use as desks; there were no chairs, so they used bricks and wooden sticks as makeshift seats. In this way, they opened the health school without spending a single cent!

In the Dazhai Health School, the students have a labor class every day. They follow the farmers to learn how to burn lime, pull flatbed carts, and farm.

Someone worried, "Studying medicine but not focusing on the profession, burning lime and treating diseases are unrelated, and the books might be read in vain!" In response to this comment, the school held a big discussion. The students said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Now, we study while working, and in the future, we will fight while working. This is the spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, now we study medicine while working, and in the future, we will treat diseases while working, being both farmers and doctors, this is our profession.

In the more than ten months since the school was established, they burned over ten tons of lime, pulled 150,000 pounds of charcoal, crushed 20 cubic meters of stones, went up the mountain to collect more than 20 kinds of medicinal herbs such as Chinese angelica, anemarrhena, and bupleurum, participated in the voluntary labor to build the commune hospital, and during the busy farming season, they also helped the nearby brigades weed the fields. Since the school was established, they have not collected a single cent of tuition from the students, have not asked the collective for a single cent of subsidy, and have not asked the state for a single cent of expenses. The income they earned from their labor, after covering the students' living expenses, was used to buy each of the 26 students a medical kit, a stethoscope, and more than 20 kinds of medicines, which the students took back to their respective production brigades.

The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "Such a health school trains young doctors with red thoughts and correct work styles." The students do not forget the poor and lower-middle peasants and maintain the character of the working people. They work in the fields, each carrying a handful of wild vegetables, and in a few months, they raised four fat pigs. They did not kill them to eat but sold three fat pigs to the state to support socialist construction.

Not Confined to the Classroom, Insisting on Learning Through Practice

The Dazhai Health School has no "standard" classrooms, no thick textbooks, no curriculum, and no fixed class times. Their classroom is in practice, and their teaching methods are entirely new.

The school started classes, but there were no full-time teachers in the classroom. Instead, a few doctors from the commune health center collectively researched and, based on their practical experience and referencing theoretical knowledge from books, compiled a lesson plan called "One-Pot Cooking." This lesson plan includes the origin, clinical symptoms, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention of a disease, all written in seven-character rhymes for the students to memorize in their notebooks. The first time, the students learned how to treat four diseases: common cold, acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, and bronchopneumonia. During the Spring Festival holiday, the "little doctors" who had studied for 24 days went on their first medical rounds. They wrapped various medicines in small handkerchiefs, went home for the New Year, and visited the poor and lower-middle peasants door-to-door. If they encountered any of the four diseases they had learned to treat, they gave them medicine. When school resumed, they tallied up and found that they had treated more than 70 people. The students jumped for joy, excitedly saying, "This teaching method is good, we can use what we learn right away."

In this way, they learn while working and work while learning, learning and working simultaneously, making rapid progress. Originally, the school had a teaching plan, aiming for the students to learn to treat 50 common and frequently occurring diseases and master 60 acupuncture points in one and a half years. However, in just ten months, they learned to treat 75 common and frequently occurring diseases and mastered 160 acupuncture points. In contrast, a health school in the county seat, detached from reality, focused on thick textbooks, and students who studied medicine for three years could not even give injections, and some could not distinguish between common Chinese medicinal herbs like ginseng and coptis. The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "We do not welcome such useless health schools; we prefer health schools that can both farm and treat diseases."

Currently, the 26 students of the Dazhai Health School are divided into two groups: half have returned to their brigades to work and practice, and half remain in the commune health center for internships, rotating every month. They come with questions and return with solutions. In addition to timely treating diseases that they can handle for the poor and lower-middle peasants, they also insist on visiting the poor and lower-middle peasants door-to-door, helping patients seek medical treatment, buying medicine, and escorting seriously ill patients to the hospital. Some even voluntarily take care of patients who lack care. At the same time, they have collected more than 30 effective folk remedies from the poor and lower-middle peasants, which can treat diseases without spending money. The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "Our little doctors, though not very skilled, serve the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly. With them, we find it convenient to see a doctor, spend less money, and they are better than those 'foreign' doctors."

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Are the Best Teachers

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai are very concerned about the growth of the Dazhai Health School. When the school was first established, Chen Yonggui, the party branch secretary of the Dazhai Brigade, said, "It is easy to establish a school, but the difficulty lies in what kind of talents you cultivate and for whom you serve. Be careful not to spend all day in the classroom!"

During the school's operation, Jia Jincai, the chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association and an old hero of Dazhai Brigade, gave multiple lectures to the students on the history of their families, villages, and communes, and the suffering of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society due to lack of medical care and medicine. He also talked about how the personnel trained by bourgeois health schools do not serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. He said, "Studying medicine is also a class struggle. One must always remember the bitterness of the class struggle and never forget the blood debt!"

When the students were about to return to their villages or go to the commune health center for internships, Liang Bianliang, the deputy party branch secretary of the Dazhai Brigade, and others held a discussion at the school. Liang Bianliang told the students, "In the past, the traitors like Liu Shaoqi and their agents, a small clique of capitalist roaders in the former Xiyang County Committee, did not care about the lives of the working people and did not even mention training semi-farmers and semi-doctors for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now, the proletarian revolutionary faction is in power, leading us to establish such a health school according to Chairman Mao's proletarian health line. No matter what, we must not forget the glorious mission given to us by Chairman Mao and must not forget the poor and lower-middle peasants and the working people."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai specially sent the revolutionary books of Chairman Mao and the shining Mao badges to the students, greatly encouraging them. Some students wrote in their diaries, "The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai are our best teachers. We must strive to be selfless, thinking only of Chairman Mao, and dedicate our lives to serving the poor and lower-middle peasants as barefoot doctors."

### 一所贫下中农欢迎的抗大式卫生学校——山西昔阳县大寨卫生学校的调查报告

    一所贫下中农欢迎的抗大式卫生学校
    ——山西昔阳县大寨卫生学校的调查报告
    山西省昔阳县大寨公社，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示，发扬大寨人自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，在一九六八年一月办起一所大寨卫生学校，正在为贫下中农培养着自己的医生。
    这所卫生学校有四个特点：
    一，贫下中农子女多。全校二十六名学生，有二十五名是贫下中农子女，其中有四个农业中学毕业生，一个初小生，其余是高小毕业生。他们最小的十五岁，最大的二十岁。他们说：“我们年纪虽小，但有一颗立志为贫下中农学医，全心全意为贫下中农服务的红心。”
    二，亦农亦医，不脱离劳动。学生来校的时候，每人带着《毛泽东著作选读》和《毛主席语录》，肩挑一副荆条筐，扛着一把锄头，一张铁锨，担着自己的粮、菜和铺盖卷。现在，他们回村的时候，一个肩上挑着荆条筐，一个肩上背着保健箱。他们高兴地说：“手上满手茧，脚下满腿泥，地里去劳动，回村沿门去看病。”
    三，这个学校不要国家开支，不要集体补助，不要学生个人带钱，坚持自力更生，走抗大的道路。学生自豪地说：“我们学习大寨人，艰苦奋斗，比住着国家给盖的大楼、领着国家的补助要光荣得多！”
    四，这个学校没有专职教员，没有那些厚厚的教科书，没有“正规”的课堂，他们由公社卫生所的医生代课，自己编教案，在实践中边学边用，边提高，立竿见影。学生们说：“这样学习最容易记，最容易懂，学了马上就能用。”
    贫下中农很欢迎这样的卫生学校。他们高兴地说：“抗大式的卫校，培养出半农半医、全心全意为人民服务的小医生，咱庄户人看病有了自家的医生了。”
    白手起家，劳动课天天上
    一九六八年一月四日，大寨公社二十一个大队的贫下中农，把自己选拔的学生送到了大寨卫生学校。当时，学校什么也没有。学生到校的第一课，是学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，专题讨论“为谁而学，为谁服务”。大家说：“我们是代表贫下中农的利益而来的，是受党支部的委托而来的。我们一定要为革命而学，为贫下中农而学，为改变农村缺医少药的状况而学，困难再大，我们不怕！我们要在艰苦环境中锻炼，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    学校没有房子，他们找下了四眼破土窑。开始，破土窑不能住，他们就借老百姓的火做饭，借贫下中农的炕头睡觉。后来，他们自己动手，把破土窑里的畜粪、杂草打扫出去，把塌了的地方补起来，把破洞抹上泥，四眼破土窑就成了学校的教室、宿舍和厨房。
    没有黑板，他们就把床板竖起来代替；没有桌子，他们就从供销社找来硬纸箱的皮皮做桌子；没有凳子，他们就搬块砖头，拣根木棒，顶凳子坐。就这样，他们没花一分钱，卫生学校开学了！
    在大寨卫生学校，学生们天天上劳动课，他们跟着农民伯伯学烧石灰，学拉平车，学种地。
    有人担心地说：“学医不务正业，烧石灰和看病挂不上钩，书怕白念！”针对这种议论，学校里展开了一场大讨论。同学们说，毛主席教导说：“现在一面学习，一面生产，将来一面作战，一面生产，这就是抗大的作风”。我们遵照毛主席的教导，现在一面学医，一面劳动，将来一面看病，一面生产，亦农亦医，这就是我们的正业。
    在学校开办以后的十个多月时间里，他们一共烧出十多万斤石灰，拉炭十五万多斤，砸石子二十立方米，上山采回苍术、知母、柴胡等二十多种药材，参加了修盖公社医院的义务劳动，农忙时还帮助附近的大队锄地。学校开办以来，没有向学生收一分钱的学费，没有向集体要一分钱的补助，没有向国家要一分钱的开支。他们自己劳动得到的收入，除补助学生全部的生活费外，剩下的给二十六个学生每人花三十多元买了一个保健箱，一个听诊器，还有二十多种药品，由学生们带回了各自的生产大队。
    贫下中农说：“这样的卫校，培养出来的小医生思想红，作风正。”学生们不忘贫下中农，保持着劳动人民的本色。他们下地劳动，一人捎带着采一把野菜，几个月喂出了四口大肥猪。他们舍不得自己杀吃，把三口大肥猪卖给国家，支援了社会主义建设。
    不死坐课堂，坚持在实践中学习
    大寨卫生学校没有“正规”的课堂，没有那些厚厚的教科书，没有课程表，没有规定上课时间，他们的课堂就在实践中，教学方法完全是新的一套。
    学校开课了，没有专职教师坐在课堂上讲课，而是由公社卫生所的几位医生集体研究，根据他们的实践经验，参照书本上的理论，编出一个被称做“一锅煮”的教案。这种教案，把一种病的来源、临床症状、诊断治疗、预防等都写出来，编成七字口诀，让学生记在自己的小本本上。第一次，学生学习了怎样治疗感冒、急性支气管炎、慢性支气管炎、支气管肺炎等四种病。春节放假，学习了二十四天的“小医生”们第一次出诊了。他们用小手巾包着各种药物，一边回家过年，一边沿门访问贫下中农，碰到是他们学会治疗的那四种病，就给点药吃。开学了，大家统计了一下，一共治好了七十多个人的小病。同学们喜得跳起来，激动地说：“这种教学办法好，学了就能用。”
    就这样，他们在学中干，在干中学，边学边干，学习进度很快。原来学校有个教学方案，计划在一年半的时间内，学生要学会治疗五十种常见病、多发病，学会针灸六十个穴位。结果，只用了十个月的时间，他们就学会治疗七十五种常见病、多发病，学会了针灸一百六十个穴位。而以前在县城里办的一所脱离实际的卫生学校，光啃厚书本，学生学医三年毕了业，有的还不会打针，有的连党参、黄连等中药都分不清。贫下中农说：“这种没用的卫校我们不欢迎，还是咱又种地又看病的卫校好。”
    现在，大寨卫生学校的二十六名学生，一半已回队里边劳动，边实践，一半留在公社卫生所实习，一个月轮换一次。他们带着问题上来，带着办法回去。他们除了及时为贫下中农治疗他们能治的病，还坚持沿门访问贫下中农，帮助病人请医、代买药，帮助把重病人送到医院，有的还主动去伺候缺人照顾的病人。同时，他们还向贫下中农收集了三十多种民间有效的土药方，不花钱就能治病。贫下中农说：“咱们这些姓‘土’的小医生，本事虽还不大，但他们全心全意为咱贫下中农服务。有了他们，咱看病方便，花钱少，他们比那些姓‘洋’的医生强。”
    贫下中农是最好的老师
    大寨的贫下中农非常关心大寨卫生学校的成长。在刚办校的时候，大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵同志就说：“办校容易，难的是看你培养出什么样的人材，为谁服务。千万注意不要整天坐在课堂上上课啊！”
    办校期间，大寨大队贫协主任、老英雄贾进才多次给同学们讲家史、村史、社史，讲旧社会贫下中农缺医少药的痛苦，讲资产阶级的卫生学校培养出来的人怎样不为贫下中农服务。他说：“学医也是搞阶级斗争的。一定要牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇！”
    同学们快要回村或到公社卫生所实习的时候，大寨大队党支部副书记梁便良等同志到学校开了个座谈会。梁便良向同学们说：“过去，大叛徒刘少奇的代理人旧昔阳县委内的一小撮走资派掌权，不管劳动人民的死活，根本谈不到为贫下中农培养亦农亦医的医生。现在无产阶级革命派掌了权，按照毛主席的无产阶级卫生路线，领导咱们大寨公社办起这样的卫生学校。咱们不论什么时候都不能忘记毛主席交给的光荣任务，不能忘记贫下中农和劳动人民。”
    大寨贫下中农还特意给同学们送了毛主席的革命宝书和金光闪闪的毛主席像章，使同学们受到了很大的鼓舞。有的学生在日记中写道：“大寨贫下中农是我们最好的老师。我们一定要做到不为名，不为利，一心想着毛主席，立志干一辈子为贫下中农服务的泥腿医生。”
