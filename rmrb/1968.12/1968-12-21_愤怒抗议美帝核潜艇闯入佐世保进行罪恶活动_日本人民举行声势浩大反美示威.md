According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, the Oriental News Agency reported: On the 19th, 13,000 patriotic workers and students in Sasebo City held a grand anti-U.S. rally and demonstration, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialist nuclear submarine "Seawolf" entering Sasebo Port.

Patriotic workers and students from Sasebo and other parts of Kyushu, Kansai, and various regions of Japan gathered in Matsuura Park for a rally. They passed a declaration expressing their determination to smash the U.S. imperialist plot to turn Japan into a nuclear war base and resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Many workers and students at the rally wore helmets, held up flags and banners, and were full of fighting spirit. Some held up portraits of Chairman Mao, and some banners read: "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" Many banners read: "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "Smash Soviet Modern Revisionism!" "Down with the Revisionist Group of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuichi Tokuda!"

Representatives from various sectors who spoke at the rally unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialist dispatch of nuclear submarines to Japan for evil activities and condemned the reactionary Sato government for following the U.S. imperialists and attempting to drive Japan onto the path of aggressive war. They also strongly denounced the reactionary police authorities for brutally suppressing the courageous struggles of students and young workers and exposed the shameful crimes of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda in sabotaging the Japanese people's anti-U.S. struggle.

After the rally, workers and students held a grand demonstration and marched towards the U.S. military base. The demonstrators surrounded the U.S. military base. A worker standing on top of a propaganda vehicle pointed to the Americans hiding behind the barbed wire of the base under the "protection" of Japanese reactionary police and said: "Look at their pale faces. No matter what weapons they have, they are not strong at all. As long as the Japanese people bravely stand up and fearlessly fight resolutely, they will definitely be able to smash the 'Security Treaty' and drive the U.S. imperialists out of Japan."

After ending the demonstration around the base, workers and students continued their march, shouting along the way: "Nuclear submarines go back!" "Return Okinawa!" "Yankees go home!" Citizens of Sasebo cheered enthusiastically for the demonstrators, supporting their just actions.

    愤怒抗议美帝核潜艇闯入佐世保进行罪恶活动
    日本人民举行声势浩大反美示威
    据新华社二十日讯  据东方通讯社报道：日本爱国工人和学生一万三千人十九日在佐世保市举行声势浩大的反美集会和示威，强烈抗议美帝核潜艇“潜水者号”闯入佐世保港。
    佐世保以及来自九州、关西和日本其他各地的爱国工人和学生在松浦公园举行的集会上通过一项宣言，表示决心粉碎美帝把日本变为核战争基地的阴谋，坚决反对日美“安全条约”。
    到会的许多工人、学生都戴上头盔，高举旗帜和标语牌，斗志昂扬。有的人高举毛主席像，有的旗帜上写着：“毛泽东思想万岁！”许多标语牌上写着：“打倒美帝！”“粉碎苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒日共宫本修正主义集团！”
    在会上讲话的各界代表一致愤怒谴责美帝派遣核潜艇到日本进行罪恶活动的行径，愤怒谴责佐藤反动政府追随美帝，妄图把日本驱上侵略战争道路的罪行。他们还强烈声讨反动警察当局对学生和青年工人的英勇斗争进行野蛮镇压，控诉日共宫本修正主义集团破坏日本人民反美斗争的可耻罪行。
    工人和学生在集会结束后举行声势浩大的示威游行，向美国军事基地进发。示威群众把美军基地包围起来。一位工人站在宣传车顶上指着在日本反动警察“保护”下躲在基地铁丝网后面的美国佬说：“请看他们发白的脸色吧。不管他们有什么样的武器，他们一点也不强大。只要日本人民勇敢地站起来，不畏强暴地进行坚决的斗争，就一定能够粉碎‘安全条约’，并且把美帝赶出日本。”
    工人和学生们结束了在基地周围的示威后继续游行，沿途高呼：“核潜艇滚回去！”“归还冲绳！”“美国佬滚回去！”佐世保的市民向示威者热烈鼓掌，支持他们的正义行动。
