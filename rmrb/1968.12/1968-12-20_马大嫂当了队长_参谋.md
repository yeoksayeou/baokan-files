It was already deep into the night, but the house of Ma Damao, a member of the Zhangjiawan Commune's Zaolinzhuang Brigade in Tongxian County, was still brightly lit. The slogans "Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi" could be heard from time to time. Ma Damao and her husband were engaged in another night of "daily criticism."

Ma Damao's husband, Ma Yucai, is the brigade leader of Zaolinzhuang. He opened the first round of criticism. He said, "The traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates the theory of 'class struggle extinction,' aiming to make us forget class struggle, fail to see class enemies, and allow them to brazenly attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and smoothly restore capitalism." As soon as Ma Yucai finished speaking, Ma Damao angrily followed up, "Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, shouts about the theory of 'class struggle extinction,' completely lying through his teeth. Class enemies always look for opportunities to cause trouble and disrupt. When we poor and lower-middle peasants organized the primary cooperative, a landlord in the village tried every means to sabotage it. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this landlord was still secretly causing trouble and disrupting production. Aren't these examples of class struggle that are shocking to see?"

Ma Damao became more and more enthusiastic in her criticism. Ma Yucai saw this as a good opportunity to help her change her mind about not wanting him to be the brigade leader. He continued, "You often say that being a cadre means running around all the time, with no benefits and only trouble. Is this not falling for the poison of Liu Shaoqi's 'class struggle extinction' theory?" This question made Ma Damao lower her head and fall silent. Seeing that her thoughts were beginning to change, Ma Yucai encouraged her, "Think about it, what kind of life did we have in the old society? Why did your father go mad? Why was your younger brother sold?"

As soon as he mentioned her father's madness and her younger brother being sold, Ma Damao's heart ached, and all the tragic memories flooded back. In the old society, where people were treated like animals, Ma Damao's family of seven relied on her father pulling a rickshaw to make a living. Every New Year's Eve, her father, barefoot, would pull a capitalist through the snow for dozens of miles, hoping to earn some money to buy a few pounds of cornmeal for the New Year. Unexpectedly, the capitalist not only gave him no money but kicked him to the ground in the snow. Ma Damao's father wanted to take the capitalist to the county magistrate to seek justice, but was beaten by the capitalist's thugs until he was covered in blood and went mad. After her father fell ill, the family lost their means of livelihood, and her mother, in pain, sold her younger brother, who was not yet three years old. Thinking of this, Ma Damao's eyes fixed on the portrait of Chairman Mao, and tears rolled down like broken pearls.

Ma Yucai, with a heavy heart, further encouraged her, "Shuying, think about it, why were we so miserable in the old society, and why are we so happy in the new society?" Ma Damao choked back tears and replied, "Because in the old society, the power was not in the hands of the working class and poor peasants, but in the new society, the laboring people have become the masters." Ma Yucai asked again, "Yes! Without power, there is nothing. Then who should hold the reins in the countryside now?" Ma Damao wiped away her tears with her sleeve and replied without hesitation, "Who else? The working class should lead, and we poor peasants should hold the power!" "Then why don't you want me to be the brigade leader?" This question left Ma Damao speechless. At this point, Ma Yucai talked more about the importance of power and exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, represented by Liu Shaoqi, who attempted to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. The deep class hatred opened her eyes, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated her heart. Ma Damao stood up excitedly and said, "Yucai, in the past, you were the brigade leader, and I didn't want you to do it. This was because I fell for the poison of Liu Shaoqi's 'class struggle extinction' theory, forgetting class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. From now on, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of 'never forget class struggle' and fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's 'six black theories.' I will firmly support you in managing the brigade's work, helping the poor and lower-middle peasants to hold and use power, and ensuring that the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements never rise again."

From then on, Ma Damao not only actively supported Ma Yucai in managing the brigade's work but also took the initiative to be his "chief of staff," receiving warm praise from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    马大嫂当了队长“参谋”
    解放军某部　张芬芝
    夜已经很深了，通县张家湾公社枣林庄大队马大嫂的屋子里依然灯火明亮，“打倒大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇”的口号声不时从屋里传出来。马大嫂夫妻俩“天天批”的战斗又打响了。
    马大嫂的爱人马玉才是枣林庄大队的队长。他首先开了第一炮。他说：“大叛徒刘少奇鼓吹‘阶级斗争熄灭论’，就是要我们忘记阶级斗争，看不见阶级敌人，让他们猖狂地攻击无产阶级专政，顺顺当当地复辟资本主义。”马玉才的话音刚落，马大嫂接着愤怒地说：“刘少奇这个大叛徒扯破喉咙鼓吹‘阶级斗争熄灭论’，完全是瞪着眼睛说瞎话。阶级敌人总是要寻找机会进行破坏捣乱的。俺们贫下中农组织初级社时，村里有个地主分子千方百计地进行破坏；在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这个地主分子还在暗中捣鬼，破坏生产。这些不就是触目惊心的阶级斗争吗？”
    马大嫂越批越起劲。马玉才感到这是个好机会，可以帮助她改变不愿让自己当队长的思想，便接上话茬说：“你常说我当干部东跑西颠的，好处落不到，闲话惹不少，这是不是中了刘少奇‘阶级斗争熄灭论’的流毒？”这一问，问得马大嫂低下头，沉默不语。马玉才看她思想开始转变，便启发她说：“你想想，咱们家在旧社会过的是什么日子？你的父亲为什么得了疯病？你的弟弟又为什么卖给人家？”
    一提起父亲的疯病和弟弟的被卖，马大嫂心如刀绞，一件件悲惨的往事浮现在眼前。在吃人的旧社会，马大嫂一家七口人，全靠父亲拉黄包车糊口。一年年关，她的父亲赤着双脚，拉着一个资本家在雪地里跑了十几里路，指望能挣几个钱，买几斤棒子面过年。没料到那个家伙不仅一文钱不给，反而飞起一脚把他踢倒在雪地里。马大嫂的父亲要拉资本家到县衙门讲理，又被资本家狗腿子打得头破血流，一气得了疯病。父亲病后，全家失去了生活来源，母亲忍痛把不满三岁的弟弟卖掉。马大嫂想到这里，两眼凝视着毛主席像，眼泪象断线珠子一样滚下来。
    马玉才怀着沉痛的心情，进一步启发她：“淑英，你再想想，咱穷人在旧社会为什么那么苦，在新社会又为什么这么甜？”马大嫂哽咽着回答：“因为旧社会政权不在工人阶级、贫下中农手里，新社会劳动人民当家作了主人。”马玉才又问：“是啊！没有政权就没有一切。那么现在农村的印把子应该由谁掌握呢？”马大嫂用衣襟擦干了泪水，不加思索地回答说：“那还用问，由工人阶级领导，咱们贫下中农掌呗！”“那你为什么不让我当队长呢？”这一问把个马大嫂问得干张嘴，说不出话来。这时马玉才又讲了政权的重要性，并揭露批判了刘少奇为代表的党内一小撮走资派妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。阶级的深仇擦亮了她的眼睛，毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了她的心坎。马大嫂站起来激动地说：“玉才，过去你当队长，我不想让你干，这是中了刘少奇‘阶级斗争熄灭论’的流毒，忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了无产阶级专政。今后我一定遵照毛主席‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’的伟大教导，狠批刘少奇的黑‘六论’，坚决支持你搞好队里的工作，为贫下中农掌好权，用好权，让地、富、反、坏分子，永世不得翻身。”
    从此以后，马大嫂不仅积极支持马玉才搞好队里工作，而且主动地给他当“参谋”，受到贫下中农的热情称赞。
