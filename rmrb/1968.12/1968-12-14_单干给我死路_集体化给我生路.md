The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without the socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete and consolidated socialism." Agricultural collectivization is the inevitable path to the common prosperity of all rural people. However, the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi openly stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, fiercely promoting individual farming. He shamelessly shouted: "Hiring labor, individual farming, should be allowed to run wild!" Is individual farming good, or is collectivization good? We poor and lower-middle peasants know the answer.

I will never forget that individual farming led me to ruin, while collectivization led me to prosperity. I am a descendant of generations who toiled for landlords. After liberation, our family of three received eighteen mu of land. At that time, I was both happy and worried. I was happy because I thought good days were coming, but I was worried because there was only one laborer in the family, and the land was too much to cultivate. Later, I had to exchange manual labor for oxen to plow my own land. I remember in 1953, I worked for others for a year to get an ox to plow my land once, and it was very late to sow. That year, we also encountered a natural disaster, and the harvest was poor. I had to give nine dou of grain as payment for the ox, and the remaining food was not much. Plus, there was a family member who was often sick, making life very difficult. However, after the establishment of the cooperative and the people's commune, the situation changed. Last year, our family increased to five people. Originally, only I could work, and I fell ill several times, working only about 700 work points the whole year. The brigade gave me a subsidy. In addition to receiving nearly 3,000 jin of grain, the family also received money, and life was good.

Liu Shaoqi's fervent promotion of individual farming is an attempt to obstruct the great historical trend of agricultural collectivization, to implement bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat in rural areas, and to make us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice. We poor and lower-middle peasants are most loyal to Chairman Mao and are determined to follow the path of collectivization!

### 单干给我死路  集体化给我生路

    单干给我死路
    集体化给我生路
    黑龙江省海林县洋草大队老贫农  陈万志
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”农业集体化是“使全体农村人民共同富裕起来”的必由之路。但是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇公然站在反动的资产阶级立场上，大刮单干风。他丧心病狂地叫嚣：“雇工，单干，应该放任自流！”是单干好，还是集体好，我们贫下中农心里有数。
    我永生永世也不会忘记，单干给了我死路，集体化给了我活路。我是个祖祖辈辈给地主扛大活的受苦人出身。解放以后，全家三口人，一下子分到了十八亩地。当时，我既高兴，又犯愁。高兴的是这下可有好日子过了，犯愁的是全家就我一个劳力，地种不过来。后来，我只好以人工换牛工耕种自己的地。记得一九五三年，我给别人干一年活，换来一头牛把自己的地耕了一遍，很晚才种上。这年又碰上天灾，收成很不好，还给别人九斗牛犋粮，最后剩下的口粮就不多了，加上家里有一个人常年生病，生活很困难。但是，有了合作社和人民公社以后，情况就不同了。去年，全家已增加到五口人，本来就我一个人能劳动，我又害了好几次病，全年只做了七百多分，大队就给了补助。全家除分到近三千斤口粮外，还分到了钱，日子过得不错。
    刘少奇这样狂热地宣扬单干，就是妄图阻止农业集体化的伟大历史潮流，在农村实现资产阶级对无产阶级的专政，使我们贫下中农受二遍苦。我们贫下中农最忠于毛主席，走集体化道路是铁了心啦！
