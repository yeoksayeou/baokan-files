On the evening of the 21st, the red waves of the radio broadcast the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao: "It is very necessary for young people to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade cadres and other people in the cities to send their children who have graduated from junior high, senior high, and college to the countryside. Let's mobilize them. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them."

Baoji County immediately burst into excitement. From the county seat to the vast rural mountain areas, there was a wave of jubilation. Workers, peasants, cadres, students, and residents took to the streets in parades, enthusiastically celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. Until late into the night, various departments and units were still holding meetings, seriously studying and discussing Chairman Mao's latest directive, with everyone pledging loyalty to Chairman Mao. The communes and production brigades organized propaganda teams to go to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants at night to spread the word, making Chairman Mao's latest directive known to every household.

Leaders Take the Lead

To implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, we must act swiftly and decisively. After the parade, the expanded meeting of the County Revolutionary Committee began. Over ten comrades present seriously studied and discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and researched measures for its implementation. Comrades said, Chairman Mao's directive that junior high, senior high, and college graduates should all go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is the fundamental way to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. It is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for the younger generation! Comrades all said: To study and implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, we must stand higher and look further, seeing the future of communism!

The light of Chairman Mao's latest directive illuminated everyone's hearts. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee unanimously agreed that to implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, cadres must take the lead. They must send their relatives and children who are living idle in the cities to the countryside first. This is the true expression of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the people, and it will be a good way to persuade city cadres and others to send their children to the countryside. The chairman of the County Revolutionary Committee expressed: He will quickly mobilize his seven family members to go to the countryside and become socialist laborers with consciousness.

At the meeting, everyone vowed loyalty to Chairman Mao, and the entire leadership of the Revolutionary Committee was mobilized.

"Chairman Mao's latest directive has shown us the way. We will not live idly in the town." This was the common sentiment of the broad masses of residents in Baoji County after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive. After celebrating with drums and gongs throughout the night, the next morning, over a hundred resident groups held meetings to study and discuss the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. Many resident group study sessions actually turned into pledge meetings. Parents of students unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words and immediately send their children to the countryside; some parents even expressed their willingness to go to the countryside with their children to settle down. Many residents, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, held family meetings to discuss the whole family moving to the countryside to settle down. They believed that staying in the towns to live idly would only add to the burden on the state and the people. After heated discussions, many resident groups actively went to the County Revolutionary Committee to pledge and send good news. Some pledged to collectively go to the mountains and countryside; others submitted lists of knowledge youth and residents who volunteered to go to the mountains and countryside to the County Revolutionary Committee. They said: "We also have two hands, and we will not live idly in the town."

This is the Greatest Trust in the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

As soon as the broadcast of Chairman Mao's latest directive ended, the phones at the County Revolutionary Committee Office and the County Office for the Placement of Knowledge Youth rang non-stop. Various communes and production brigades reported to the County Revolutionary Committee about the situation where the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and knowledge youth in the countryside, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, were filled with joy and enthusiasm, and quickly launched a wave of studying, propagating, implementing, and carrying out the latest directive. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, after hearing Chairman Mao's voice, were extremely moved and said, "Chairman Mao said: 'It is very necessary for young people to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.' This is the greatest trust in us poor and lower-middle peasants."

The broad masses of knowledge youth who went to the mountains and countryside, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, were in high spirits, unanimously shouting: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! Knowledge youth Chen Lin said: "After I came to the mountainous area to settle down, I once did not want to live a hard life and thought of leaving after three years. Chairman Mao's latest directive pointed out the direction for me to advance. I am determined to follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao and settle down in the countryside for life."

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directive, various communes and production brigades called the County Revolutionary Committee to request more knowledge youth to be sent to them. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said, Chairman Mao entrusted the knowledge youth to us for re-education, and we must cultivate them into people who serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly."

From the leadership to the masses, from the towns to the countryside, the entire Baoji County has taken action. The County Revolutionary Committee plans to hold a series of meetings to further study, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, and to establish a special organization. They are determined to launch a major mobilization, properly arranging all the knowledge youth in the county who have not yet been placed, those allocated from outside, and residents in the towns who have no jobs to go to the countryside.

    来一个动员
    宝鸡县广大革命群众和干部欢呼毛主席最新指示发表纪实
    二十一日晚上，红色电波传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的声音：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”宝鸡县立即沸腾起来了，从县城到广大农村山区一片欢腾。广大工人、农民、干部、学生、居民纷纷上街游行，热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。直到深夜，各机关、单位还在开会，认真学习和讨论毛主席的最新指示，人人向毛主席表忠心。各公社、大队组织宣传队连夜到贫下中农家中宣传，使毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓。
    领导干部起带头作用
    贯彻落实毛主席最新指示，要雷厉风行。游行回来，县革委会常委扩大会便开始了。与会的十多个同志认真学习、讨论了毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，研究了贯彻落实的措施。同志们说，毛主席指示初中、高中、大学毕业的学生都到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，这是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本途径，是毛主席他老人家对青年一代的最大关怀！同志们都说：学习、落实毛主席的最新指示就要往高处站，往远处看，看到共产主义的未来！
    毛主席最新指示的光辉照亮了大家的心。革委会的同志们一致认为，落实毛主席的最新指示，干部要起带头作用，要把自己留在城镇中“吃闲饭”的家属、子女尽先送到农村去，这才是忠于毛主席，忠于人民的表现，才能很好地说服城里的干部和其他人，把自己的子女送到农村去。县革委会主任表示：要把自己一家七口人很快地动员到农村去，成为有社会主义觉悟的劳动者。
    会上，个个争着向毛主席表忠心，整个革委会领导成员都动员起来了。
      “毛主席的最新指示给我们指明了方向，我们也不在镇上吃闲饭。”这是宝鸡县城广大居民听到毛主席最新指示后的普遍反映。居民们敲锣打鼓欢腾了一个晚上之后，第二天上午一百多个居民小组都召开会议，学习座谈毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。许多居民小组的学习会实际上成了表决心会，学生家长们纷纷表示，坚决听毛主席的话，马上把自己的子女送到农村去；有的家长还表示要同自己的子女一道去农村安家落户。很多居民听了毛主席的最新指示后，开了家庭会，商量全家到农村去安家落户。他们认为留在城镇吃闲饭，是给国家和人民增加负担。不少居民小组经过热烈讨论之后，积极到县革委会去表决心，送喜报。有的决心集体上山下乡；有的把报名上山下乡的知识青年和居民的名单报送县革委会。他们说：“我们也有两只手，不在镇上吃闲饭。”
    这是对贫下中农最大的信任
    毛主席的最新指示广播刚结束，县革委会办公室、县知识青年安置办公室的电话就响个不停。各社、队纷纷向县革委会汇报广大贫下中农、在乡知识青年听了毛主席的最新指示后，欢欣鼓舞，迅速掀起了学习、宣传、贯彻、落实最新指示热潮的情况。广大贫下中农听到毛主席的声音，万分激动地说，毛主席他老人家说：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。”这是对我们贫下中农最大的信任。
    广大上山下乡的知识青年听到毛主席的最新指示后，一片欢腾，齐声高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！知识青年陈林说：“我来到山区安家落户后，曾一度不愿过艰苦生活，想过三年就走。毛主席的最新指示给我指出了前进的方向。我决心走毛主席指引的革命道路，一辈子扎根农村。”
    在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，各社、队纷纷打电话向县革委会要求给他们派送更多的知识青年去。广大贫下中农说，毛主席把知识青年交给我们进行再教育，我们一定要把他们培养成“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的人。
    从领导到群众，从城镇到乡村，整个宝鸡县行动起来了。县革委会计划召开一系列会议进一步学习、宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示，并且成立了专门机构。决心来一个大动员，把全县少数还没有安置的知识青年，外地分配来的知识青年以及在城镇无职业的居民都妥善地安排到农村去。
