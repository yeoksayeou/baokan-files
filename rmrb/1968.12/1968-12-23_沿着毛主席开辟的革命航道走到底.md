We are honorably approved to go to Shanxi for rural work. As we are about to embark on this new journey, our dearest and most beloved Chairman Mao has issued new instructions to us. Chairman Mao said: "It is very necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We should persuade cadres and other people in the cities to send their children who have finished junior middle school, senior middle school, and college to the countryside. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Chairman Mao's new instructions are a new call to arms for us, a beacon on our path forward, and a long-term strategy to prevent and guard against revisionism, ensuring that our socialist iron fortress remains unshakable for generations to come. Chairman Mao's new instructions speak to the hearts of revolutionary youth and Red Guards. They are the greatest care, encouragement, motivation, and education for us. With hearts full of excitement, we wish Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

For over a decade, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi has relentlessly promoted his counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, trying every means to lead our youth down the path of revisionism. In the matter of graduation assignments, he spread poison everywhere, peddling such counter-revolutionary revisionist goods as the "read books to become officials" and "go to the countryside to gain experience" theories, in a vain attempt to realize his capitalist restoration dream. Thinking of the old society, old hatreds and new grievances surge in our hearts. The four of us were all born into working-class families. Our parents all have bitter stories to tell, and our families all have accounts of blood and tears. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved us from misery and led us onto the broad road of socialism. Our brothers and sisters all went to school, from primary school to college, something we could only dream of in the old society! Without the Party and Chairman Mao, we would have nothing today. Truly, the Party's kindness is greater than the heavens and earth, and Chairman Mao's love is greater than that of parents. We will shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

We will use our actions to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. We firmly believe in Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. Our parents also firmly support us in taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants. Meng Xiangjie's father, over sixty years old, said: "In the old society, I suffered for over forty years. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for us. I firmly support Xiangjie in going to the countryside and receiving re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants." The blood of the class has opened our eyes, and the path shown by our great leader Chairman Mao is the brightest path in the world.

With the blue sky as paper, we write our resolve, and with our red hearts, we express our oaths.

Dear Chairman Mao, we four approved to go to Shanxi for rural work pledge to you: We will resolutely walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants for life, humbly accept the re-education of poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly change our old thoughts, forever be the students of poor and lower-middle peasants, serve them for life, and be good children of the working people. We will temper ourselves in the great revolutionary struggle, face the world, grow in the great three-revolutionary practices, and cultivate ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Dear Chairman Mao, we will not disappoint your expectations for us youth. We will resolutely follow the revolutionary path you have opened for us. We have the confidence and determination to strive hard for life, together with poor and lower-middle peasants, build socialist new villages with our own hands, thoroughly change the face of our motherland that is poor and blank, and be new peasants forever loyal to you.

    沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道走到底
    北京师大二附中毕业班　孟祥杰　张同建　牛志民　张桂芬
    我们是已被光荣批准到山西插队的知识青年。在我们即将踏上新的征途的时刻，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席又向我们发出了最新指示。毛主席说：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”毛主席的最新指示是向我们发出的新的战斗动员令，是我们前进道路上的灯塔，是防修反修、保证我们社会主义的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色的百年大计、千年大计、万年大计。毛主席的最新指示说出了我们革命青年、红卫兵小将的心里话，毛主席的最新指示是对我们的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策、最大教育。我们怀着无比激动的心情，千遍万遍地祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    十几年来，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇竭力推行反革命修正主义教育路线，千方百计把我们青年一代引上修正主义道路。在毕业分配问题上，他到处放毒，兜售什么“读书做官论”、“下乡镀金论”等一整套反革命修正主义黑货，妄图实现其复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。提起万恶的旧社会，新仇旧恨涌心头。我们四个人都出生在工人家庭里，我们的父母人人有笔辛酸史，我们的家庭，家家有本血泪账。是党和毛主席把我们救出了苦海，带领我们走上了社会主义的康庄大道。我们的兄弟姐妹都上了学，从小学、中学直到大学，这在旧社会简直是作梦也不敢想啊！没有党和毛主席就没有我们今天的一切。真是天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席他老人家亲。我们要一千遍、一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    我们要用自己的实际行动，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线。我们对毛泽东思想坚信不疑，走毛主席指引的革命道路坚定不移。我们的父母也坚决支持我们走和工农相结合的道路。孟祥杰同学的父亲六十多岁了，他说：“在旧社会，我受了四十多年的苦。没有毛主席就没有我们的今天。我坚决支持祥杰上山下乡，去接受贫下中农的再教育。”阶级的血泪擦亮了我们的眼睛，伟大领袖毛主席指引的路是世界上最最光明的路。
    蓝天作纸写决心，掏尽红心表誓言。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们四名被批准到山西插队的知识青年，向您老人家宣誓：我们决心一辈子走与工农相结合的道路，虚心接受贫下中农的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，永远做贫下中农的小学生，一辈子为贫下中农服务，做劳动人民的好儿女。我们决心在伟大的革命斗争中经风雨，见世面，在伟大的三大革命实践中锻炼成长，把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们决不辜负您对我们知识青年的殷切希望，我们坚决沿着您所开辟的革命航道走到底。我们有信心，有决心一辈子艰苦奋斗，和贫下中农一起，用自己的双手建设社会主义的新农村，彻底改变祖国一穷二白的面貌，做永远忠于您的新农民。
