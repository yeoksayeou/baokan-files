The great leader Chairman Mao, on April 15, 1958, in "Introducing a Cooperative," recommended Yingjiu Brigade of Fengqiu County to the whole country. The poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, recently held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply studying the history of the two-line struggle within the party. They compared Mao Zedong's brilliant instructions in "Introducing a Cooperative" with the past ten years of Yingjiu Brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, fighting against nature, fighting against the land, fighting against class enemies, and using their own hands to draw a picture of a socialist new countryside.

Yingjiu Brigade is located in a low-lying area prone to flooding and disasters. Before liberation, the lives of farmers were extremely impoverished. After liberation, their lives improved significantly. In 1955, an agricultural production cooperative was established. After two years of hard work, they undertook major water conservancy projects, transforming dry land into paddy fields and saline-alkali land into rice fields, basically eliminating drought and flood disasters, and greatly changing the original landscape.

On April 15, 1958, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao showed great concern and support for this cooperative that had fought for two years to change its appearance. Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly, "Apart from other characteristics, the most prominent feature of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank. Poverty leads to change, to action, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper has no mistakes on it, so the newest and most beautiful characters can be written, the newest and most beautiful pictures can be drawn." Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions pointed out the direction for the revolutionary people of the whole country, greatly inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yingjiu Brigade to thoroughly change their poor and blank appearance. They carried forward the spirit of "poverty leads to change, to action, to revolution," and on the vast fields of the people's commune, launched a great struggle against nature. They achieved another bumper harvest in two consecutive years.

Just as the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yingjiu Brigade were advancing victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi threw out the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," attempting to destroy the socialist collective economy and restore capitalism. Liu Shaoqi's local agent personally took charge in Yingjiu, advocating that "three freedoms and one contract" was a "life-saving policy," forcibly dividing collective farmland into small plots and distributing them to the people, and under the guise of promoting production, carried out extensive "material incentives." The poor and lower-middle peasants saw this counter-revolutionary revisionist trickery with their own eyes and hated it in their hearts, engaging in a struggle against it.

After the "Twenty-three Articles" personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao were issued, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yingjiu Brigade, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and expelled a handful of bad elements who had infiltrated the brigade leadership. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were full of spirit and fighting spirit, writing Chairman Mao's "Introducing a Cooperative" on the walls along the street as a guide for action, and quickly launched an unprecedented wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and launched a struggle to thoroughly change their poor and blank appearance. Over the past ten years, they have built more than 200 large and small canals, constructed more than 1,400 mu of terraced fields and platforms, reclaimed saline-alkali land, dug 10 wells, and achieved bumper harvests in both drought and flood conditions for all 3,100 mu of farmland in the brigade. In the past three years, the brigade has sold more than 600,000 jin of surplus grain and more than 40,000 jin of cotton to the state. The old disaster-stricken area has disappeared, and what stands before people is a magnificent picture of a socialist new countryside.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yingjiu Brigade deeply realized from their own struggle practice: following Chairman Mao is victory! They proudly said: Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has guided us poor and lower-middle peasants of Yingjiu to draw the newest and most beautiful picture!

    贫下中农画出了最新最美的画图
    伟大领袖毛主席一九五八年四月十五日在《介绍一个合作社》中，向全国推荐了封丘县应举大队。这个大队的贫下中农怀着无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，最近举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入学习党内两条路线斗争的历史。他们对照毛主席在《介绍一个合作社》中的光辉指示，回顾了十年来应举大队贫下中农沿着毛主席指引的方向，与天斗、与地斗、与阶级敌人斗，用双手绘出社会主义新农村锦绣图画的战斗历程。
    应举大队地势低洼，易涝、多灾。解放前，农民生活非常贫困。解放后，生活有了很大改善，一九五五年成立了农业生产合作社。建社后，经过两年奋战，大修水利，改旱地为水田，改盐碱地为稻田，基本上免除了旱涝灾害，大大改变了原来的面貌。
    一九五八年四月十五日，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对这个苦战二年改变面貌的合作社，给予了极大的关怀和支持。毛主席深刻地指出，“除了别的特点之外，中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。……穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”毛主席的光辉指示，给全国革命人民指明了前进的方向，极大地鼓舞了应举大队的贫下中农彻底改变一穷二白面貌的革命干劲。他们发扬“穷则思变，要干，要革命”的精神，在人民公社的广阔田野上，展开了一场战天斗地的伟大斗争，又一连两年获得了大丰收。
    就在应举大队贫下中农沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线乘胜前进的时候，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇抛出了“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货，妄图摧毁社会主义集体经济，复辟资本主义。刘少奇在当地的代理人亲自出马，坐镇应举，鼓吹什么“三自一包”是“救命政策”，硬把集体的耕地划成小块块，分包给群众，并以扶植生产为名，大搞“物质刺激”。贫下中农对这一套反革命修正主义黑货，看在眼里，恨在心头，进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“二十三条”下达后，应举大队的贫下中农在毛主席光辉思想的指引下，狠狠地批判了刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，把混进大队领导班子的一小撮坏人清除了出去。广大贫下中农意气风发，斗志昂扬，把毛主席《介绍一个合作社》这篇光辉著作，书写在临街的墙壁上，作为行动的指南，迅速掀起了前所未有的活学活用毛泽东思想的高潮。他们在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，展开了彻底改变一穷二白面貌的斗争。十年来，修筑大小渠道二百多条，修建条田、台田一千四百多亩，改造了盐碱地，打机井十眼，使全大队三千一百多亩耕地实现了旱涝保丰收。近三年来，大队卖给国家余粮六十多万斤，棉花四万多斤。“老灾区”的面貌一去不复返了，展现在人们面前的是一幅社会主义新农村的壮丽图景。
    应举大队的贫下中农从自己的斗争实践中深深认识到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利！他们自豪地说：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，指引俺应举贫下中农画出了最新最美的画图！
