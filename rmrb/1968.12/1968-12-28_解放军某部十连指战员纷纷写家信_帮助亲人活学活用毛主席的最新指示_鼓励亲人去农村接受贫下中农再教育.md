Soldiers of a Certain Unit's Tenth Company Write Letters Home
Help Family Members Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions
Encourage Family Members to Go to the Countryside to Receive Re-education from Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Our reporter informs that the soldiers of the Tenth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, which has been rated as a "Four Good" company for four consecutive years, have used writing letters home to help their family members study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have helped to eliminate the harmful effects of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, and encouraged their family members to go to the countryside to settle down and receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. This has further raised the awareness of the two-line struggle among the officers, soldiers, and their family members.

Over the past period, the vast majority of the family members of the officers and soldiers in the Tenth Company have responded to Chairman Mao's great call, going to the countryside to settle down and receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. However, some family members have expressed incorrect thoughts in their letters. These incorrect thoughts are reflections of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly propagated. It is not enough to propagate it to a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The Party branch believes that if the officers and soldiers can follow Chairman Mao's teachings when writing letters home, propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, they will definitely help these family members quickly raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and walk the path of uniting with workers and peasants. Therefore, the Party branch mobilized everyone to correctly answer the various questions raised by their family members in their letters. Communist Party member and soldier Liu Jie received a letter from his younger brother, who said he wanted to respond to Chairman Mao's call for educated youth to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and was determined to walk the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, because his parents did not understand, saying, "The child has grown up and flown away, and the parents cannot benefit from it at all," he had not yet signed up. After receiving the letter, Liu Jie knew that his parents had been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and had the old idea of "raising children to support old age." He wrote three letters to his parents, propagating Chairman Mao's teachings, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, pointing out the dangers of "raising children to support old age," and helping his parents raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, making them also actively support his younger brother in going to the countryside to settle down.

For those whose family members did not raise any problems in their letters, they also, based on their own experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts in their letters home, helping their family members to have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings. On the evening of the 21st, the radio broadcast Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "It is necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, and university to the countryside. We must mobilize them. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Many officers and soldiers immediately studied and discussed this, and wrote a batch of letters home that night, persuading their family members to go to the countryside. Soldier Tian Baofu, in a letter to his younger sister, enthusiastically discussed his understanding of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of reading books to become officials," encouraged his younger sister to actively sign up to go to the countryside, and follow the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. This will thoroughly eliminate the harm of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, promote the revolutionization of thought, and temper oneself into a red successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    解放军某部十连指战员纷纷写家信
    帮助亲人活学活用毛主席的最新指示
    鼓励亲人去农村接受贫下中农再教育
    本报讯　连续四年评为四好连队的解放军某部十连指战员，利用写家信帮助亲人活学活用毛主席的最新指示，肃清大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的流毒，鼓励亲人到农村去安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育，进一步提高了干部、战士及其亲属的两条路线斗争觉悟。
    在过去的一段时间里，十连绝大多数干部、战士的有关亲属，都能坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，纷纷到农村去安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育。但是，也有个别同志的亲属在来信中流露出一些不正确的思想。这些不正确的思想都是阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的反映。
    毛主席教导说：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”党支部认为：干部、战士在给家中写信时如果能遵照毛主席的教导，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，一定会帮助这些亲属迅速提高两条路线斗争觉悟，走与工农相结合的道路。于是，党支部便发动大家，在写信时，正确回答亲属提出的各种问题。共产党员、战士刘杰，收到弟弟的来信，说他想响应毛主席关于知识青年接受工农兵再教育的伟大号召，决心走与工农兵相结合的道路，但是由于父母亲思想不通，说“孩子长大了，远走高飞，做父母的沾不到一点光”，所以，他暂时还未报名。刘杰收到信后，知道父母中了刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义路线的毒，存在着“养儿防老”的旧思想，便一连三次给父母写信，宣传了毛主席的教导，狠批了刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，指出了“养儿防老”的危险性，帮助父母提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，使他们也积极地支持他弟弟到农村去安家落户。
    在亲属来信中没有发现什么问题的同志，也能根据自己活学活用毛主席最新指示的体会，在家信中狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，帮助亲属更深刻地理解毛主席的教导。二十一日晚上，广播里传来了毛主席的最新指示：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”许多干部、战士立即进行学习讨论，并连夜赶写了一批家信，说服有关亲属到农村去。战士田宝富在给他妹妹的信中，畅谈了学习毛主席最新指示的体会，狠批了刘少奇的“读书做官论”，鼓励妹妹积极报名下乡，沿着毛主席指引的光明大道，到农村去接受贫下中农再教育，彻底肃清反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，促进思想革命化，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人。　 			本报通讯员
