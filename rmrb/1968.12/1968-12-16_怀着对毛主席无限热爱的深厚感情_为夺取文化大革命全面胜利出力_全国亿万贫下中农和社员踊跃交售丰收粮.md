With deep affection for Chairman Mao and to contribute to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, billions of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members across the nation are enthusiastically selling their bumper harvest grain to the state.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members say that it is Chairman Mao who led us to another bumper harvest, and we are selling bumper harvest grain; it is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that drove us to victory on the agricultural front, and we are selling victory grain. Selling more and better grain to the state is an expression of our boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Amidst the triumphant songs of the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the billions of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members across the nation, who have achieved a bumper harvest this year, are filled with deep proletarian affection for the great leader Chairman Mao. Under the great encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, they are enthusiastically selling grain to the state. Currently, the national grain procurement is in full swing.

By December 5th, Anhui and Jiangxi have completed their annual grain procurement plans. Henan, Guangxi, Hunan, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Shandong provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have nearly completed their annual grain procurement plans. Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Guangdong have completed over 80% of their annual grain procurement plans. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants say: We will use our enthusiastic sale of grain to the state as a practical action to make Chairman Mao proud, to bring glory to our government—the newly born revolutionary committees, and to contribute to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In selling grain to the state, the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members across various regions are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further extensively and deeply carrying out the mass activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line—the "Three Loyalties" activity. Various levels of revolutionary committees have also organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the communes and production teams, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's great instructions on "must grasp grain" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," as well as other instructions. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members say: It is Chairman Mao who led us to another bumper harvest, and we are selling bumper harvest grain; it is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that drove us to victory on the agricultural front, and we are selling victory grain. We sell more and better grain to the state, expressing our boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

In the process of selling grain to the state, from the south to the north of our country, everywhere presents a fiery scene. The poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members participating in the grain delivery teams, holding high the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, beating drums and gongs, deliver the grain to the state grain procurement stations. In Shangrao County, Jiangxi, there is a production team where eighteen women over sixty years old organized a grain delivery team. They carried baskets and joined the grain delivery army, delivering over a thousand pounds of bumper harvest grain. In Nantun Commune, Xiangcheng County, Henan, Dongfeng Production Brigade has consecutively for five years completed the annual grain delivery task in one summer. After this year's bumper harvest, the poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade, through study, extensively discussed the rationale of farming for the revolution. They proposed: We want to stand in the Dongfeng Brigade, looking towards Beijing, farming for the revolution, and continuously achieving new merits. Everyone decided to sell even more surplus grain to the state.

Under the encouragement of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," in the high tide of selling grain to the state, in connection with local realities, fiercely criticized the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the locality who promoted the theory of "extinction of class struggle," "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and in the grain procurement work promoted the reactionary revisionist black goods of "more retention, less sale," "retain good, sell bad," and at the same time criticized and fought against the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists and speculators who sabotaged the grain procurement work, setting up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the fields, drying grounds, and grain procurement stations. Through the fiery revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members further heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promoting the grain procurement work.

Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members in the countryside of our country, in the midst of the mass movement of deeply studying the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, continue to actively organize grain delivery teams, striving to quickly complete and overfulfill the task of selling grain to the state, to welcome the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party, to contribute to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the new leap in socialist construction, and to make their own contributions.

    怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情　为夺取文化大革命全面胜利出力
    全国亿万贫下中农和社员踊跃交售丰收粮
    广大贫下中农和社员群众说，是毛主席领导我们又一次获得丰收，我们交的是丰收粮；是无产阶级文化大革命推动我们在农业战线上打了胜仗，我们交的是胜利粮。向国家多交粮、交好粮，就是表达我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚
    新华社十五日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，获得今年农业丰收的我国农村亿万贫下中农、社员群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，踊跃向国家交售粮食。目前，全国粮食征购入库已经进入高潮。
    到十二月五日止，安徽、江西已经完成了全年粮食征购计划。河南、广西、湖南、上海、四川、山东等省、市、自治区已经接近完成全年粮食征购计划。江苏、湖北、浙江、广东已经完成全年粮食征购计划的百分之八十多。广大贫下中农说：我们要用踊跃向国家交售粮食的实际行动，为毛主席争气，为我们的政权——新生的革命委员会争光，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利出力！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。各地贫下中农和社员群众在交售粮食中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加广泛深入地开展了群众性的忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动。各地各级革命委员会还组织了毛泽东思想宣传队深入到社、队，同贫下中农一起大办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于“必须把粮食抓紧”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大指示以及其它指示。广大贫下中农和社员群众说：是毛主席领导我们又一次获得丰收，我们交的是丰收粮，是无产阶级文化大革命推动我们在农业战线上打了胜仗，我们交的是胜利粮。我们向国家多交粮、交好粮，就是表达我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚。
    在交售粮食中，我国从南方到北方，到处呈现出一派火热的景象。参加送粮大队的贫下中农、社员群众，高举伟大领袖毛主席像、毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓，把粮食送到国家粮食收购站。江西上饶县有一个生产队，十八个六十岁以上的老大娘组织了一个送粮队，她们手提篮子和送粮大军一起送了一千多斤丰收粮。河南项城县南屯公社东风大队，连续五年夏季一次完成全年粮食交售任务。今年丰收以后，这个大队的贫下中农在学习中，大议为革命种田的道理。他们提出：我们要站在东风队，眼望北京城，为革命种田，不断立新功。大家作出决定，又向国家多售了大量余粮。
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，广大贫下中农和社员群众，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在向国家交售粮食的高潮中，联系当地实际，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在当地的代理人所推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”以及在粮食征购工作中推行的“多留少卖”、“留好卖次”等反革命修正主义黑货，同时批判斗争了破坏粮食征购工作的地、富、反、坏、右分子和投机倒把分子，在田间、晒场和粮食收购站摆开了革命大批判的战场。通过轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，广大贫下中农和社员群众进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了粮食征购工作。
    现在，我国农村广大贫下中农、社员群众在深入学习党内两条路线斗争史的群众运动中，继续积极组织送粮队，争取很快地完成和超额完成向国家交售粮食的任务，为迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利和社会主义建设事业的新的跃进，作出自己的贡献。
