Jiangyin County's revolutionary committees at various levels are vigorously promoting education on the struggle between the two lines. The revolutionary line of Chairman Mao is being discussed daily, annually, and for generations. By assisting grassroots units in organizing specialized study classes on the history of the struggle between the two lines, the class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses have been heightened, driving the struggle, criticism, and transformation to develop further.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing on the 5th, Jiangyin County in Jiangsu Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction, "Organizing study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes," has organized specialized Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the history of the struggle between the two lines at all levels. This has led the broad masses throughout the county to launch a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines.

The latest directive from the great leader Chairman Mao, "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be discussed frequently and repeatedly. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; the broad revolutionary masses should all know about it," and the republication of Chairman Mao's "Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," greatly inspired the broad revolutionary masses of Jiangyin County. Over 2,000 members of the revolutionary committees at various levels personally led large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, rural areas, institutions, schools, shops, and neighborhoods, assisting grassroots units in organizing specialized study classes on the history of the struggle between the two lines. The broad revolutionary masses in the study classes studied the history of the struggle between the two lines, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They linked the study to their actual situations, increasingly deeply recognizing that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more necessary it is to continuously raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Only in this way can the struggle, criticism, and transformation be carried out well and thoroughly. They said: "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must discuss it daily, monthly, annually, and for generations, persist in learning in struggle and using in struggle, and remember Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds and implement them in our actions."

In the study classes organized in various places, while seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and reviewing Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee, they closely linked the class struggle in their regions and units with the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party.

In the study classes organized in various places, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, using Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee and other works of Chairman Mao as weapons, launched a great denunciation and criticism of Liu Shaoqi's treacherous acts of betraying the party and the country and attempting to restore capitalism. The broad revolutionary masses, with their mouths and pens, individually joined the battle, treating the revolutionary criticism as a major task to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Many production teams of poor and lower-middle peasants criticized Liu Shaoqi from above and fought living targets from below, using shocking class struggle facts to expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Jiangsu who attempted to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through the revolutionary criticism, through the exposure of Liu Shaoqi's agents in Jiangsu's desperate struggles, everyone more deeply understood the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism," which is extremely wise and correct.

In studying the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres also seriously criticized the "February Countercurrent" of 1967, which opposed the decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, opposed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and opposed the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres further heightened their class struggle and awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They immediately took action, actively participating in the various battles of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    江阴县各级革委会狠抓两条路线斗争教育
    毛主席的革命路线天天讲年年讲代代讲
    帮助基层举办学习两条路线斗争史的专题学习班，提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动斗、批、改深入发展
    据新华社南京五日电　江苏江阴县各级革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，层层举办学习两条路线斗争史的专题毛泽东思想学习班，领导广大群众在全县展开了两条路线斗争史的学习运动。
    伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示传来和毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》重新发表，极大地鼓舞了江阴县广大革命群众。全县各级革委会的二千多名成员亲自带领大批毛泽东思想宣传队，下到工厂、农村、机关、学校、商店、街道，帮助基层单位举办两条路线斗争史的专题学习班。广大革命群众在学习班里学习两条路线斗争史，热烈颂扬毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线。他们联系实际，越学越深刻地认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，就越需要不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，只有这样，才能把斗、批、改搞好、搞彻底。他们说：“毛主席的革命路线，我们要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，代代讲，坚持在斗争中学，在斗争中用，把毛主席的指示铭记在头脑中，落实在行动上。”
    各地举办的学习班，在认真学习毛主席最新指示和重温毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告的过程中，紧密联系本地区、本单位的阶级斗争实际，学习党内两条路线斗争的历史。
    在各地举办的学习班上，广大革命群众、革命干部以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席其他著作为武器，对刘少奇叛党叛国、妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行展开了大声讨、大批判。广大革命群众人人口诛笔伐，个个投入战斗，把革命大批判当作巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的一件大事来抓。许多社队的贫下中农上批刘少奇，下斗活靶子，用触目惊心的阶级斗争事实，揭发批判了刘少奇及其在江苏的代理人妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪行。经过革命大批判，经过揭露刘少奇在江苏代理人的垂死挣扎，大家更深刻地体会到伟大领袖毛主席的“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的”这一最新指示，无比英明，无比正确。
    广大革命群众、革命干部在学习两条路线斗争史中，还严肃地批判了那个反对党的八届十一中全会决定、反对无产阶级文化大革命、反对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一九六七年的“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案的妖风。通过两条路线斗争史的学习，广大革命群众和革命干部进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，他们立即行动起来，积极投入斗、批、改的各项战斗。
