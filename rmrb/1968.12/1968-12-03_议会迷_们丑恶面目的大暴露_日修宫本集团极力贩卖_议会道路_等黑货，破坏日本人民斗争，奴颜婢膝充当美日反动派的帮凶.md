The ugly face of the "parliamentary fetishists" has been fully exposed. The Japanese Communist Party's (JCP) Revisionist group led by Masamichi Miyamoto is vigorously peddling the "parliamentary road" and other black goods, sabotaging the struggles of the Japanese people, and groveling as lackeys of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

New China News Agency, December 2nd: Our correspondent reports that the JCP Revisionist group led by Masamichi Miyamoto is relentlessly pursuing the "parliamentary road" and advocating "legalism," doing everything in its power to sabotage the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic movement, and groveling as lackeys of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The facts prove that the Miyamoto Revisionist group is a disgraceful traitor to the Japanese revolution.

In the history of the international communist movement, all kinds of traitors and scabs have betrayed the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposed the fundamental principle of smashing the bourgeois state machine through violent revolution and establishing a proletarian state machine, and vigorously advocated a "peaceful transition" from capitalist society to socialist society through the "parliamentary road." Masamichi Miyamoto and Sanzo Nosaka are such advocates of "peaceful transition."

As early as 21 years ago, Miyamoto said: Because the Potsdam Proclamation "guaranteed" Japan's democracy, there is already a prospect of establishing a democratic government through parliament without armed uprising. Nosaka also shouted that under the military occupation of U.S. imperialism in Japan, "there is already the possibility of the proletarian party having a majority in the Diet, establishing its own government, destroying the bureaucratic machinery and its power, and seizing the reins of government." In the spring of 1956, after Khrushchev's black report at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Miyamoto group actively responded and, at the 7th Plenary Session of the JCP Central Committee held in June of the same year, took the opportunity to stuff the "peaceful transition" black goods into the resolution "On Certain Problems of the Struggle for Independence and Democratic Liberation." In 1961, the Miyamoto group controlled the 8th Congress of the JCP and passed a "peaceful transition" program, vigorously advocating: "If a stable majority can be secured in the Diet, it can turn the Diet from a tool of reactionary rule into a tool for the service of the people," "radically change the reactionary state apparatus, and establish a people's republic."

For many years, the Miyamoto group has been striving to secure a "stable majority in the Diet." In this year's July House of Councillors "election," the Miyamoto group performed even more brazenly. They peddled the "peaceful transition" junk, saying that this election would relate to Japan's "future," ordering all "party organizations" nationwide to throw themselves into the election campaign. The "party organization" in Tokyo even began campaigning as early as May last year. Miyamoto and others also used bourgeois television and radio to loudly denounce China and slander the Japanese people's anti-U.S. struggle, while shouting slogans like "peace," and groveling to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, assuring them: "The JCP (Miyamoto Revisionist group) will absolutely not carry out a violent revolution." The Miyamoto group's treacherous acts greatly helped the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

The treacherous activities of the Miyamoto group have been appreciated by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. Therefore, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries increased the Miyamoto group's seats in the House of Councillors from four to seven in the House of Councillors "election." The Miyamoto group was overjoyed by this trick of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. They instructed the *Akahata* and *Zenshi* magazine to blow their own horns in endless articles. Subsequently, Miyamoto gave a summary of the experience of this "election" at the "National Prefectural and Municipal Committee Chairpersons Conference" he controlled. Nosaka also deceived himself and others by saying: "The Communist Party has seven seats in the House of Councillors, so it can truly compete with the conservative party on policy." They have completely forgotten the lesson of 1949 when the JCP, which had 35 seats in both houses, was stripped of the right to engage in political activities by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries issuing a "Red Purge Order," and their dream of securing a "stable majority" in the more than 700 seats of the Diet seems to be "not far off" just because they increased by three seats in this "election." This is the full exposure of the ugly face of the Miyamoto group's "parliamentary fetishists."

U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people. After the Second World War, the U.S. stationed troops in Japan, established bases, and placed Japan under its military occupation, and attempted to rule Japan long-term through the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Japanese people have been fighting for national independence, demanding the withdrawal of all U.S. military bases and troops, the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and the return of Japanese territory Okinawa. They are determined to launch a fierce and protracted struggle to drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan. However, the Miyamoto group has gone against the will and actions of the Japanese people. They shamelessly advocate gaining national independence through the bourgeois parliament, shouting that if they obtain a majority in the Diet, they can form a democratic government with the task of opposing the "Security Treaty," and this government can "notify" the U.S. government to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Recently, the U.S. played an "election" trick in Okinawa, and the Miyamoto group jumped out again, shouting that this election is the "first voice" to break U.S. imperialism's rule over Okinawa, and declared that they would "spare no effort" to produce a "clear Okinawa" through the "election." The Miyamoto group is thus shamelessly plotting to lead the Japanese people's magnificent anti-U.S. movement onto the "parliamentary road" detour, thereby helping U.S. imperialism to occupy Japan long-term.

The Miyamoto group, which insists on the "parliamentary road," has done everything to sabotage the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle. In Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries conspired to seize farmers' land to build the so-called "New Tokyo International Airport" for invading Asia. When the farmers rose up to fight, the Miyamoto group told the farmers to act according to their "legalism." When the Sato government sent armed police to suppress the farmers, they did not allow the farmers to resist; when the farmers were brutally suppressed by the reactionary police, they did not go to support them. The farmers of Sanrizuka recognized their enemies and friends in the struggle, drove out the Miyamoto group's people, and, with the support of the broad patriotic masses in Japan, launched a fierce attack on the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, achieving great victories. At this time, the Miyamoto group gathered a group of rich peasants to prepare to build a "Peace Tower" outside the Sanrizuka struggle site, plotting to use "praying for peace" to disperse the farmers' fighting spirit. The purpose of building the tower reads: It is meaningless to resist with violence against what has already been decided in the Diet. On October 21st, tens of thousands of workers, farmers, youth, students, and citizens in Japan held a magnificent anti-U.S. demonstration in more than 500 places across the country. This demonstration broke through the Miyamoto group's "legalism" framework and dealt a powerful blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. However, the Miyamoto group went mad and slandered the patriotic actions of Japanese workers and students as "provocative acts" of "Trotskyites," and viciously demanded that the Sato reactionary government further suppress the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. The Miyamoto group's crimes of using "legalism" to sabotage the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle are truly innumerable.

The numerous crimes of the Miyamoto group have provided the best self-portrait of their traitorous faces and a negative example for the Japanese people, accelerating the awakening of the Japanese people's revolution. In front of the revolutionary people of Japan, all reactionary forces' attempts to sabotage the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people are in vain. The surging waves of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle are breaking through all obstacles and advancing victoriously.

As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Japanese people will definitely be able to drive the U.S. imperialists out of their own territory, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will definitely be realized."

    “议会迷”们丑恶面目的大暴露
    日修宫本集团极力贩卖“议会道路”等黑货，破坏日本人民斗争，奴颜婢膝充当美日反动派的帮凶
    新华社二日讯　本社记者报道：日共宫本修正主义集团极力追求“议会道路”和推行“合法主义”，千方百计地破坏日本人民的反美爱国运动，奴颜婢膝地充当美日反动派的帮凶。事实证明，宫本修正主义集团是日本革命的可耻叛徒。
    国际共产主义运动史上的形形色色的叛徒和工贼，无不背叛马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，反对用暴力革命打碎资产阶级的国家机器和建立无产阶级的国家机器的基本原则，竭力鼓吹通过“议会道路”从资本主义社会“和平过渡”到社会主义社会。宫本显治和野坂参三就是这样的“和平过渡”论者。
    早在二十一年前，宫本就说过：由于波茨坦公告“保证”了日本的民主，在日本已经展望到了“不经过武装起义而通过议会建立民主政权的可能性”。野坂也叫嚷，在美帝国主义军事占领下的日本，“已经产生了无产阶级党在国会内占有多数席位，建立自己的政府，破坏官僚机构及其势力，把政权掌握到手里的可能性”。一九五六年春，赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十大所作的黑报告一出笼，宫本集团便积极响应，并且在同年六月召开的日共中央第七次全体会议上乘机把“和平过渡”的黑货塞进“关于争取独立和民主的解放斗争道路上的若干问题”的决议中。一九六一年，宫本集团又控制日共第八次代表大会，通过了一项“和平过渡”的纲领，大肆鼓吹：“如果能够在国会中拥有稳定的过半数，就能够把国会从反动统治的工具变成为人民服务的工具”，“从根本上改变反动的国家机构，建立人民共和国”。
    多年来，宫本集团一直在为追求“在国会中拥有稳定的过半数”而拚命奋斗。在今年七月的日本参议员“选举”中，宫本集团表演得更加露骨。它们大肆兜售“和平过渡”的破烂货，说什么这次选举将关系到日本的“前途”，号令全国所有的“党组织”全力以赴地投入竞选运动。东京的“党组织”甚至从去年五月就开始了拉选票的活动。宫本显治等人还通过资产阶级的电视和广播，一面大肆反华和诬蔑日本人民的反美斗争，一面大喊“和平”等骗人口号，并且摇尾乞怜地向美日反动派保证：“日共（宫本修正主义集团）绝对不进行暴力革命”。宫本集团的叛卖行径，帮了美日反动派的大忙。
    宫本集团的叛卖活动，受到了美日反动派的赏识。因此，美日反动派在参议员“选举”中使宫本集团在参议院的席位从四席增加到七席。宫本集团对美日反动派玩弄的这一手法受宠若惊。它们为此指使《赤旗报》和《前卫》杂志连篇累牍地大吹大擂。随后，宫本显治就在他所控制的“全国都道府县委员长会议”上为这次“选举”总结经验。野坂参三还自欺欺人地说：“共产党在参议院拥有七个席位，因此可以在政策上真正地同保守党较量”。它们对一九四九年曾经在参众两院占有三十五席的日共被美日反动派颁布一个“赤色整肃令”，就剥夺了日共中央委员会的从事政治活动的权利的教训，忘得一干二净，而它们所追求的在国会的七百多议席中“拥有稳定的过半数”的黄粱美梦，似乎是由于在这次“选举”中增加了三席就“为期不远”了。这是宫本集团的“议会迷”丑恶面目的大暴露。
    美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人。第二次世界大战以后，美帝在日本驻扎军队，设立基地，把日本置于它的军事占领之下，并且凭借日美“安全条约”企图长期统治日本。日本人民为争取民族独立，一直在进行着反美爱国斗争，要求撤除一切美军基地和撤走美国武装部队、废除日美“安全条约”、归还日本领土冲绳。他们决心展开猛烈持久的斗争，把美帝国主义赶出日本。但是，宫本集团却同日本人民的意愿和行动背道而驰。它们无耻地鼓吹通过资产阶级议会来获得民族独立，叫喊什么“如果得到国会的多数，成立以反对‘安全条约’为一项任务的民主政府”，这个政府就可以“通知”美国政府废除日美“安全条约”。最近，美帝在冲绳玩弄“选举”把戏，宫本集团又跳出来叫嚷什么这次选举是“打破”美帝国主义统治冲绳的“第一声”，并且声言要为通过“选举”产生一个“明朗的冲绳”而“竭尽全力”。宫本集团就是这样无耻地阴谋把日本人民的轰轰烈烈的反美运动引入“议会道路”的歧途，从而帮助美帝国主义长期占领日本。
    坚持走“议会道路”的宫本集团，百般破坏日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。在千叶县三里塚，美日反动派阴谋霸占农民耕地修建为侵略亚洲服务的所谓“新东京国际机场”。当农民起来进行斗争时，宫本集团却叫农民按照它们的“合法主义”行事。佐藤政府派武装警察镇压农民，它们不准农民反抗；农民遭到反动警察残酷镇压，它们不去支援。三里塚农民在斗争中认清了敌友，驱逐了宫本集团的人马，并在日本广大爱国群众的支持下奋起痛击美日反动派，取得了很大的胜利。这时，宫本集团网罗一批富农准备在三里塚的斗争现场以外建立“和平塔”，阴谋用“祈祷和平”来涣散农民的斗志。建塔的宗旨写道：对于国会上已经决定了的事情，用暴力反抗，是没有意义的。十月二十一日，日本的工人、农民、青年、学生和市民几十万人在全国五百几十个地方举行了声势浩大的反美示威。这次示威冲破了宫本集团的“合法主义”框框，有力地打击了美日反动派。但是，宫本集团却丧心病狂地诬蔑日本工人和学生的爱国行动是“托洛茨基分子”的“挑衅行为”，并且恶毒地要求佐藤反动政府进一步镇压日本人民的反美爱国斗争。宫本集团用“合法主义”来破坏日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的罪行真是罄竹难书。
    宫本集团的大量罪行，为它的叛徒嘴脸作了最好的自我写照，为日本人民提供了反面教材，加速了日本人民的革命觉醒。在日本革命人民面前，一切反动势力破坏日本人民革命事业的任何企图都是徒劳的。日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的汹涌浪潮，正在冲破一切阻拦，胜利地向前发展。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出：“日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去，日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。”
