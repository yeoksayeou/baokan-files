The visit by the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to our country is a new and powerful manifestation of the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples, parties, governments, and armed forces of the two socialist countries of Albania and China. During our country's joyous November holidays, the distinguished guests and comrades from the great People's Republic of China came among us, adding even more festive atmosphere to our celebrations.

Tens of thousands of workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers of the People's Army, and the entire people welcomed the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation with such fervent, sincere, and passionate enthusiasm. This demonstrated their deep affection for the fraternal Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and its outstanding leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the greatest and most loyal friend of the Albanian people. This sentiment stems from our shared ideals and our common struggle for revolution and socialism, against our common enemies—the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. This friendship, which is growing stronger and deeper on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, has been forged by the two parties led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "The brotherly friendship and complete unity between our two parties, two republics, and two peoples are a great victory for our people, an important factor in our country's socialist construction, in the defense of our homeland, and in the defense of the Marxist-Leninist cause and the world revolution."

The distinguished guests brought with them the deep and sincere love of the 700 million Chinese people for the Albanian people, as well as powerful revolutionary support. We regard the speeches made by the guests at the friendly rallies in Tirana, Fier, and Berat, and their conversations with workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, and soldiers of the People's Army, as new expressions of our shared goals and common struggle; as new expressions of our firm resolve to advance together in good times and bad, in the struggle for revolution, socialism, and communism. The Albanian people feel and cherish the internationalist support of their Chinese brothers at this crucial moment for the Albanian people. When the People's Republic of Albania took the revolutionary historic action of declaring the abolition of the Warsaw Pact and withdrawing from this enslaving, aggressive pact, the complete support of the Chinese people and Comrade Mao Zedong's serious warning to our enemies—the imperialists and revisionists—provided great assistance to the Albanian people in their struggle for socialist construction and the defense of their homeland's freedom and independence. This fraternal support was once again confirmed in the telegrams sent by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai to our country's leaders on the occasion of our national holiday. The telegram said: "We once again declare to you: The 700 million people of China, who have gone through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to be the staunch rear guard of the Albanian people and will, at all times and under all circumstances, firmly support your struggle against imperialism and revisionism."

The visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation to our country, and the discussions held during the visit, as always, were in complete agreement on all issues discussed, both in thought and action. This will help to further develop and strengthen the friendship and comprehensive fraternal cooperation between the peoples, parties, governments, and armed forces of the two countries. This makes our people and all revolutionaries in the world happy, and it makes the enemies of revolution and socialism—the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries—painful and angry. As Comrade Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, emphasized in his speech at the banquet held for the Chinese guests: Let the external enemies of socialist Albania, whether those under the banner of NATO or those under the banner of the Warsaw Pact, know that the Albanian-Chinese friendship is not only manifested in the fraternal internationalist relations in the ideological, political, and economic spheres, but also in the fraternal internationalist relations in the military sphere.

Our people, as close comrades-in-arms of the fraternal Chinese people, express their great joy at the brilliant victories achieved by the People's Republic of China in socialist construction and on the socialist revolutionary front. The Albanian people and their Party and Government sincerely congratulate the brilliant victories of world historical significance achieved under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought and teachings in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The exposure and overthrow of the bourgeois revisionist headquarters represented by the traitor Liu Shaoqi have forever dashed and buried the hopes of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to drag the great China back from the socialist path to the capitalist path. The magnificent victories of the Chinese people in revolution and construction have tempered and consolidated the red China a hundredfold, and their significance goes beyond the borders of this country. The historic resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have opened up new and great prospects for the Chinese people on the road of revolution and construction. In the unprecedented enthusiasm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the conditions for thought and organization have been prepared for the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China at an appropriate time. Today, the great People's Republic of China has become a socialist power with a developed modern industry, advanced socialist agriculture, scientific and technological levels reaching the world's highest level, and a great national defense force capable of defeating any invader or alliance of invaders. The People's Republic of China has become the hope and the strongest pillar of the revolutionary peoples of all countries, and an insurmountable obstacle to the hegemonic plans of the Soviet and American imperialists to dominate the world.

During their stay in Albania, the Chinese friends felt even more deeply the great joy of our people at the brilliant victories of the Chinese people. At the same time, they also saw how our people are carrying out the decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor, the teachings of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan with such revolutionary enthusiasm. In the struggle to build socialism victoriously and to strengthen our homeland comprehensively, we have always received fraternal internationalist aid from the People's Republic of China. The new economic agreements recently signed in Beijing between our two countries are another proof of this. According to these agreements, our country will receive aid that is extremely significant not only in quantity but also in political content and high quality. With the help of long-term loans from the People's Republic of China, our country will build new and large projects in a relatively short period of time, such as a metallurgical complex that can process 800,000 tons of nickel-iron ore per year, an integrated refinery that can process 1 million tons of crude oil per year, a large hydroelectric power station with a capacity of about 400,000 kilowatts on the Drin River at Fier, and many other factories. This will rapidly further increase productivity, strengthen the independence of our economy, and help to establish new and powerful industrial sectors. The construction of these projects—new monuments to Albanian-Chinese friendship—will greatly promote industrial and agricultural production. Our people regard this aid as another powerful internationalist aid from our fraternal Chinese people. For this, our people express their deep gratitude and heartfelt thanks to the Chinese comrades, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong.

The visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation to our country has made an important new contribution to further consolidating the eternal friendship between Albania and China. This visit will be recorded as another memorable event in the annals of our fraternal, comprehensive relations. The visit by the close friends from the People's Republic of China has become a powerful manifestation of the determination of the peoples, parties, governments, and armed forces of the two countries to march shoulder to shoulder in the struggle to defend Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and revolution throughout the world.

The Albanian newspapers "Unity," "Warrior," "Voice of Youth," and "Teacher" also published editorials, warmly congratulating the successful visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation to Albania.

    日益加强的革命友谊和战斗团结
    阿《人民之声报》发表社论热烈欢呼中国党政军代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚成功
    新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》四日发表题为《日益加强的革命友谊和战斗团结》的社论，热烈欢呼中国党政军代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚成功。社论全文如下：
    由中共中央委员、中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜同志率领的中国党政军代表团对我国的访问，是阿中两国人民、两党、两国政府和两个社会主义国家的军队之间的革命友谊和战斗团结的新的强有力的体现。在我国欢乐的十一月的节日里，伟大的人民中国的贵宾和战友来到我们中间。他们的到来，更加增添了我们的节日气氛。
    数万工人、农业合作社社员、人民军战士和全体人民对中国党政军代表团如此热烈、真挚和激情的欢迎，表现了他们对兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党及其杰出的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的最伟大和忠实的朋友毛泽东同志的深情厚谊。这种感情的源泉来自于我们共同的理想，来自于为革命和社会主义、为反对共同敌人——以美帝为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义而进行的斗争。日益加强和发展的、有着马克思列宁主义磐石般基础的这一友谊，是由以恩维尔·霍查同志和以毛泽东同志为首的我们两党锤炼起来的。恩维尔·霍查同志曾经说过：“我们两党、两个共和国、两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和完全一致，是我国人民的伟大胜利，是我国社会主义建设，保卫我们的祖国，保卫马克思列宁主义事业和世界革命的重要因素。”
    贵宾们从伟大的人民中国带来了七亿中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的深切的、真诚的热爱和有力的革命声援。我们把贵宾们在地拉那、发罗拉和培拉特友好大会上的讲话中，在同工人、农业合作社社员和人民军战士的交谈中，对我们党和我国人民所讲的十分热情的话，看作是我们目标一致、共同战斗的新的表现；看作是在美好的日子里和困难的日子里，在为革命、社会主义和共产主义的斗争中，永远坚定不移地共同前进的新的表现。阿尔巴尼亚人民感受到和珍视中国兄弟在阿尔巴尼亚人民极其重要的时刻所给予的国际主义支持。当阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国采取了革命的历史性的行动——宣布废除华沙条约并退出这一奴役性的侵略条约的时候，中国人民所给予我们的完全支持和毛泽东同志对我国的敌人——帝国主义、修正主义的严重警告，对我国人民的社会主义建设、保卫祖国的自由和独立的斗争给予的援助，使阿尔巴尼亚人民力量倍增。这一兄弟般的有力支持在毛泽东同志和林彪同志以及周恩来同志在我国国庆的时候给我国领导人的电报中又一次得到了证实。电报说：“我们再次向你们表示：经过无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将坚定不移地支持你们的反帝反修斗争。”
    中国党政军代表团在我国的访问，在访问期间所进行的会谈一如既往地在思想和行动上对所讨论的一切问题都是一致的，它有助于进一步发展和加强两国人民、两党、两国政府和两国军队之间的友谊和全面的兄弟般的合作。这使我国人民和全世界一切革命者高兴，使革命的敌人和社会主义的敌人——帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派痛楚和恼怒。正如部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志在为中国贵宾举行的宴会上的讲话中所强调的：让社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的外部敌人，不论是那些打着北大西洋公约组织旗号的敌人，还是那些打着华沙条约旗号的敌人，都知道阿中友谊不仅表现在意识形态、政治和经济方面的兄弟般的国际主义的关系中，而且表现在军事方面的兄弟般的国际主义的关系中。
    我国人民作为兄弟的中国人民的亲密战友，向中国党政军代表团表达了他们对人民中国在社会主义建设和社会主义革命战线上所取得的辉煌胜利的巨大喜悦。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其党和政府衷心地祝贺在毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想和学说指引下的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的具有世界历史意义的辉煌胜利。揭露和摧毁了以叛徒刘少奇为代表的资产阶级修正主义司令部，这使美帝和苏修企图把伟大的中国从社会主义道路拉回到资本主义道路的希望永远破灭和被埋葬了。中国人民在革命和建设中的宏伟胜利百倍地锻炼和巩固了红彤彤的中国，其意义超越了这个国家的国界。中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的历史性决议，为中国人民在革命和建设的道路上开辟了新的伟大的远景。在空前未有的无产阶级文化大革命的激情中，已经为在适当的时候召开中国共产党第九次代表大会准备好了思想和组织条件。今天，伟大的人民中国已经成为一个具有发达的现代工业、先进的社会主义农业、达到世界最高水平的科学技术和能够击败任何侵略者或侵略者同盟的巨大国防力量的社会主义强国。中华人民共和国成为各国革命人民的希望和最强大的支柱，成为苏美为实现它们主宰世界的霸权计划的不可逾越的障碍。
    中国朋友在阿尔巴尼亚逗留期间，更加感受到我国人民对中国人民的辉煌胜利的巨大喜悦。同时，他们也看到了，我国人民正在以何等的革命热情执行劳动党第五次代表大会的决议、党和霍查同志的教导以及第四个五年计划的任务。在胜利地建设社会主义和全面地加强我们祖国的斗争中，我们一贯得到中华人民共和国兄弟般的国际主义援助。我们两国最近在北京签订的新的经济协定就是又一个证明。根据这些协定，我国将得到不仅在数量上，而且在政治内容和高质量方面都具有极其重大意义的援助。在人民中国的长期贷款的帮助下，我国将在一段较短的时间内建成新的巨大项目，例如每年处理八十万吨镍铁矿石的冶金联合企业，每年能加工一百万吨原油的综合炼油厂，在德林河上的菲尔兹建设一座发电能力为四十万瓩左右的大型水电站，以及其它许多工厂，这将迅猛地进一步提高生产力，这将加强我国经济的独立性，有助于建立新的和强大的工业部门。建设这些项目——阿中友谊的新的纪念碑，将进一步大大促进工农业生产。我国人民把这一援助看作是兄弟的中国人民的又一强有力的国际主义援助。对此，我国人民向中国兄弟、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志表示深切感激和最衷心的谢意。
    中国党政军代表团访问我国，对进一步巩固阿中永恒友谊作出了重要的新贡献。这次访问将成为又一次值得纪念的事件记载在我们兄弟般的全面关系的史册中。来自人民中国的知心朋友的访问，已成为我们两国人民、两党、两国政府和两国军队在世界上捍卫马克思列宁主义、社会主义和革命的伟大事业的斗争中决心并肩前进的强有力的体现。
    阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》、《战士报》、《青年之声报》和《教师报》也分别发表社论，热烈祝贺中国党政军代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚成功。
