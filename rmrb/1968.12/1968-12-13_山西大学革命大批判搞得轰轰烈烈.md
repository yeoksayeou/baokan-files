The revolutionary masses have been fully mobilized to criticize and condemn the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi. The revolutionary criticism campaign at Shanxi University is thriving.

Under the leadership of the workers stationed on campus and the People's Liberation Army propaganda team, revolutionary teachers and students have closely combined the revolutionary criticism campaign with the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Taiyuan on the 12th stated: The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." Chairman Mao's latest directive has greatly inspired the workers and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed at Shanxi University. They immediately led the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to summarize the experience of the previous period of carrying out the revolutionary criticism campaign and education on the struggle between the two lines, to further deepen the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, and to promote the school's work in all aspects to flourish.

For more than ten years, Shanxi University has been controlled by a small clique of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have been promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi. They advocated the theory of "reading books to become officials," attempting to turn Shanxi University into a school for cultivating successors of revisionism and serving their capitalist restoration. After the workers and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered Shanxi University, the first thing they did was to lead the entire school's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and proletarian educational revolutionary thoughts. They also combined the actual situation of the struggle between the two lines in the school and the situation since the Cultural Revolution to expose, criticize, and fight against the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanxi University. Recently, after revolutionary teachers, students, and staff restudied Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's latest directives, the revolutionary criticism campaign has become even more vigorous and intense. On campus, inside and outside classrooms, along the roads, in dormitories, and in dining halls, revolutionary criticism columns can be seen everywhere. Denunciation meetings, condemnation meetings, and criticism meetings follow one after another. Revolutionary teachers and students, in combination with the actual situation of their departments and classes, use the method of recalling and comparing to criticize the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the Mathematics Department angrily exposed the crimes of Liu Shaoqi's agents in promoting the revisionist educational line and discriminating against and suppressing the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. The Mathematics Department's Class 65A has 31 children of poor and lower-middle peasants. After they were admitted, they were slandered by the school's capitalist-roaders as "lowly-born," "simple-minded," and "incapable of being educated." Therefore, they were placed in a separate class and discriminated against in all aspects. However, the capitalist-roaders regarded the children from exploiting classes as having "prospects for cultivation" and formed a so-called "elite" class, giving them special treatment in teacher assignments and scholarship distributions. Many students in the Chinese Department complained that they had been poisoned by the revisionist educational line in the past, spending all day reading books, unaware of the seasons, focusing on their work, and ignoring politics, all wanting to be "writers." As a result, they lost their political direction, their bodies were damaged, and many of them developed myopia and headaches. Through the revolutionary criticism campaign, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have further deeply realized that they must thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, completely eliminate its poison, and establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

Recently, through repeated and serious study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shanxi University have felt the need to further deepen the revolutionary criticism campaign. A student in the Foreign Languages Department originally thought that the class enemies who had been exposed were dead tigers, and there was not much to criticize. Through study and reflection, he received a great education. He said, the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi has not been eliminated. We must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, carry out the criticism thoroughly, and eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi. Some students in the Chemistry Department's Class 64 originally thought that writing criticism articles was the job of scholars, and they could not contribute much. After the lid of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the school was further lifted, they realized that revolutionary criticism is a struggle for power between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, a struggle to consolidate the proletariat's leadership in politics and ideology. Doing a good job in revolutionary criticism is not about being a scholar; it is fundamentally about relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary masses' awareness of the struggle between the two lines. With their awareness raised, they immediately started writing criticism articles and drawing cartoons criticizing Liu Shaoqi, working until the early morning of the next day.

The deepening of the revolutionary criticism campaign has effectively promoted the work of cleaning up the class ranks. The revolutionary masses in the school's administrative departments, following Chairman Mao's teachings, analyzed the enemy situation with a class and class analysis perspective, sharpened their eyes, and exposed two counter-revolutionaries who had been long protected and employed by the capitalist-roaders and had infiltrated revolutionary mass organizations to sabotage the Cultural Revolution during the Cultural Revolution. Now, the work of cleaning up the class ranks in Shanxi University is developing in depth.

### 山西大学革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈

    充分发动群众人人口诛笔伐狠批刘少奇反革命修正主义路线
    山西大学革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈
    广大革命师生在驻校工人、解放军宣传队率领下，把革命大批判和学习两条路线斗争史紧密结合起来，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟
    新华社太原十二日电　伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席这一最新指示极大地鼓舞了进驻山西大学的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，他们立即领导广大革命师生员工总结前一段开展革命大批判和两条路线斗争教育的经验，更深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，推动学校各方面工作蓬勃发展。
    山西大学过去十多年一直被一小撮叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派所把持，他们竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，宣扬“读书做官论”，妄图把山西大学办成培养修正主义接班人的学校，为他们复辟资本主义服务。工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队进驻山西大学以后，进行的头一件工作就是领导全校革命师生员工反复学习毛主席的一系列最新指示和无产阶级教育革命思想，并且结合本校两条路线斗争的实际和文化大革命以来的情况，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在山西大学的代理人展开了广泛深刻的大揭发、大批判和大斗争。最近，革命师生员工重新学习了毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席的最新指示以后，革命大批判更是轰轰烈烈，如火如荼。校园里，教室内外，大路两旁，宿舍，饭厅，革命大批判专栏到处可见，控诉会、声讨会、批判会一个接着一个。广大革命师生结合本系、本班的实际情况，运用回忆对比的方法，人人口诛笔伐，集中地批判了刘少奇及其代理人推行反革命修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行。
  数学系的革命师生愤怒地揭发了刘少奇在山西大学的代理人推行修正主义教育路线，排斥、打击贫下中农子女的罪行。数学系六五级甲班有三十一名贫下中农子女，入学以后被学校走资派污蔑为“出身低贱”、“头脑简单”、“不堪造就”，因而把他们单独编班，从各方面加以歧视；而走资派对出身于剥削阶级家庭的子女，却认为有“培养前途”，另编成所谓“尖子”班，并且在配备教师、分配助学金等方面给予特殊照顾。中文系的许多同学控诉说，过去受了修正主义教育路线的毒害，成天闭门读书，不闻春秋，埋头业务，不问政治，一心想当“作家”，结果政治上迷失了方向，身体受到摧残，不少人得了近视眼、头痛病。通过革命大批判，广大革命师生进一步深刻地认识到，必须把刘少奇的修正主义教育路线批透批臭，彻底肃清它的毒素，才可能确立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    最近，山西大学的革命师生员工通过反复认真地学习两条路线斗争历史，联系到山西大学两条路线斗争的情况，大家更加感到有必要深入地开展革命大批判。外语系一个同学原来认为被揪出来的阶级敌人是死老虎了，再批判也没多大油水了，通过学习和回顾，使他受到很大的教育。他说，大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒还没有肃清，我们一定要更高地举起革命大批判的旗帜，把大批判搞深搞透，肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想。化学系六四级有部分同学原来认为写批判文章靠秀才，自己使不上劲。学校阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的盖子进一步揭开以后，使他们认识到，革命大批判是一场无产阶级和资产阶级在思想领域中的夺权斗争，是巩固无产阶级在政治思想上的领导权的斗争，搞好革命大批判不是靠秀才，最根本的是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠革命群众的两条路线斗争觉悟。认识提高了，他们便连夜动手写批判文章，画批判刘少奇的漫画，一直干到第二天凌晨。
    革命大批判的深入开展，有力地推动了清理阶级队伍的工作。校行政单位的广大革命群众遵照毛主席的教导，以阶级和阶级分析的观点，分析了敌情，擦亮了眼睛，揪出两个过去被走资派长期包庇重用，文化大革命中又混入革命群众组织破坏文化大革命的反革命分子。现在，山西大学清理阶级队伍的工作正向纵深发展。
