Urban schools have students from both urban workers and residents, as well as from poor and lower-middle peasants from rural areas. How should these schools be managed? We believe that if they are managed solely by factories, it will be difficult to arrange agricultural labor and extracurricular education for some rural students. If they are managed solely by production brigades, it will be difficult to manage the extracurricular education for a large number of students who are children of workers and residents.

Given this special nature, we propose three schemes for managing these schools:

1. If there is a factory near this type of school, a "three-in-one" revolutionary education leadership group consisting of the factory, the production brigade, and the school should be formed to lead the school.

2. If this type of school is far from factories and most of the students are from the city, a "three-in-one" revolutionary education leadership group consisting of the workers' propaganda team, the poor and lower-middle peasants' propaganda team, and the school should manage the school, and coordinate with designated factories and communes.

3. For some schools located in the suburbs where most students come from production brigades, the school should be managed by the production brigade.

    三个方案
    城镇学校，既有城镇工人、居民的子女，也有农村贫下中农的子女。这类学校怎么办？我们认为，如果单由工厂办，那末一部分农村学生的农忙劳动、校外教育就难以安排；如果单由大队办，那末将有一大批在校学习的工人及居民子女的校外教育难以管理。
    根据这种特殊性，我们提出管理这类学校的三个方案：
    一、这类学校附近有工厂，则由工厂、生产大队、学校组成“三结合”的教育革命领导小组，领导学校。
    二、这类学校如果远离工厂，而大部分又是城市学生，则应由工人宣传队、贫下中农宣传队、学校组成“三结合”的教育革命领导小组管理学校，并和指定的工厂、社队挂钩。
    三、有些学校位于城郊，而学生绝大部分来自生产大队，那末，学校应由生产大队来办。
