New China News Agency, Singapore: The Malayan newspaper "People's Forum" recently published an editorial strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes in their mad arrests of Malayan anti-imperialist patriots and revolutionary masses. The editorial pointed out that the Malayan people must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and must raise high the great red banner of revolutionary armed struggle to smash the violence of the counter-revolutionaries with revolutionary violence.

The editorial said that the current world revolutionary situation is excellent and is getting better and better. The days of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the two biggest counter-revolutionary centers and the biggest neo-colonialist forces of the contemporary world, are getting worse and worse. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, especially the revolutionary armed struggles, have developed rapidly; the progressive student movements and workers' movements in capitalist countries are surging and magnificent, plunging the capitalist world into a new and more serious crisis.

The editorial said that under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved a great and decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-chi and his counter-revolutionary accomplices who were hiding within the Communist Party of China, and uprooting a major source of trouble that attempted to restore capitalism in China.

The editorial said: "More importantly, the most sharp weapon for the oppressed nations and peoples of the world to struggle for liberation—invincible Mao Zedong Thought—has been widely spread throughout the world. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes an infinite material force, becoming the great driving force of the revolution. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the world revolution is developing more rapidly along the correct course."

The editorial pointed out that in recent years, the revolutionary people of Malaya (including Singapore) have been studying Mao Zedong Thought with great eagerness and have been striving to apply Mao Zedong Thought, combining it with the specific conditions of Malaya, to carry out anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles.

The editorial said: "We must study, apply, and promote Mao Zedong Thought better. Only in this way can the edge of our struggle be directed at the vital points of the reactionary regime, and the victory of the Malayan revolution be undoubted!"

The editorial said: "The Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew fascist regimes always use their high-pressure policies and brutal suppression actions to teach the people lessons. This time's fascist-style mass arrests clearly expose the hypocrisy of the 'one-person-one-vote democratic elections' boasted by the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew regimes, clearly telling people that the 'parliamentary democracy' of the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew regimes is a thoroughgoing fraud, and declaring the complete and thorough bankruptcy of the 'parliamentary road' in Malaya (including Singapore)!" The editorial went on to say: "Let us firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' and smash the violence of the counter-revolutionaries with revolutionary violence!"

The editorial concluded: "Malayan people, unite and march forward bravely under the great red banner of revolutionary armed struggle!"

    马来亚《人民论坛》号召革命人民学习、运用和宣传毛泽东思想
    高举武装斗争红旗粉碎反革命暴力
    强烈谴责拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团迫害马来亚革命人民
    新华社讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《人民论坛》最近发表社论，强烈谴责拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团疯狂逮捕马来亚反帝爱国志士和革命群众的法西斯暴行。社论指出，马来亚人民要牢牢记住毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，高举革命武装斗争的伟大红旗，以革命的暴力粉碎反革命的暴力。
    社论说，目前世界革命形势大好，而且越来越好。美帝、苏修这两个当代最大的反革命中心和最大的新殖民主义势力的日子越来越不好过。世界各国人民的革命斗争，特别是革命武装斗争，得到了迅速发展；资本主义国家的进步学生运动与工人运动风起云涌、波澜壮阔，使资本主义世界陷入了新的更严重的危机。
    社论说，中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导下取得了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大的、决定性的胜利，把隐藏在中国共产党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其反革命同伙揪了出来，铲除了妄图在中国复辟资本主义的一大祸根。
    社论说：“更重要的是，全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的最锐利的武器——战无不胜的毛泽东思想已经广泛地在全世界传播开来。毛泽东思想一旦被人民群众所掌握，就变成了无穷无尽的物质力量，变成了革命的伟大动力。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，世界革命沿着正确的航道更迅猛地发展。”
    社论指出，近年来，马来亚（包括新加坡）革命人民如饥似渴地学习毛泽东思想，并且努力运用毛泽东思想，结合马来亚的具体情况，开展反帝革命斗争。
    社论说：“我们要更好地学习、运用和宣传毛泽东思想，唯有这样，我们的斗争锋芒才能指向反动政权的要害，我们马来亚革命的胜利才是毫无疑义的！”
    社论说：“拉赫曼、李光耀法西斯政权总是用他们的高压政策和残酷镇压行动，给人民上课。这次的法西斯式的大逮捕，正好说明拉赫曼、李光耀政权吹嘘的‘一人一票民主选举’的虚伪，正好告诉人们，拉赫曼、李光耀政权的‘议会民主’是彻头彻尾的大骗局，并且宣告了‘议会道路’在马来亚（包括新加坡）的全面、彻底的破产！”社论接着说：“让我们牢牢地记住毛主席的教导：‘枪杆子里面出政权’，以革命的暴力粉碎反革命的暴力！”
    社论最后写道：“马来亚人民团结起来，高举革命武装斗争的伟大红旗奋勇前进吧！”
