The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "If we think that we do not need to limit capitalism now, if we think that we can abandon the slogan of 'regulating capital,' this is completely wrong. This is the viewpoint of right opportunism." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive embodies the fundamental interests of the proletariat and reflects the urgent demands of the broad masses of laboring people.

However, the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great renegade Liu Shaoqi vehemently opposed the Party's policy of utilizing, limiting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. Soon after the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he rushed to Tianjin, gave speeches everywhere, held discussion meetings, and spread poison, engaging in a series of evil activities. He actually said such nonsense as "public and private enterprises should develop together," advocating that "from raw materials to the market, both state-owned and private enterprises should discuss and allocate together."

Can state-owned economy and private economy "discuss together," "allocate together," and "develop together"? Absolutely not! We, the revolutionary staff of the Dongfanghong Department Store (formerly the Yong'an Company), fully understand the situation of the former Yong'an Company and know that the so-called "joint development" is essentially the development of capitalism.

Under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the entire nation launched the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements, repelling the fierce onslaught of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie's agent within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, was taken aback and once again played the tune of "joint development." Liu Shaoqi's agent in Shanghai, Chen Pisha and his ilk, also shouted that state-owned commerce should quickly "stand still" to let private commerce catch up for "joint development." They showed extreme "care and concern" for the former Yong'an Company: ordering the People's Bank to provide large amounts of loans, ordering the Department Store to supply a large number of goods, and ordering the Trust Company to introduce a large number of government agencies and collective purchasing units to the former Yong'an Company. Thus, the former Yong'an Company obtained more goods than state-owned enterprises, sold more popular items than state-owned enterprises, causing the turnover of some state-owned enterprises to drop significantly, while the turnover of the former Yong'an Company rose significantly. This is the serious consequence caused by the "joint development" advocated by Liu Shaoqi!

Under the protection and support of Liu Shaoqi's black policy of "joint development," the capitalists of the former Yong'an Company became even more rampant in their attacks on socialist enterprises: illegally purchasing low-priced goods from state-owned stores, using all means to purchase materials freely across the country, passing off inferior goods as superior ones, cheating customers, and making huge profits.

Due to the support of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanghai for the capitalists' attacks on state-owned commerce, some socialist commercial enterprises were harmed, while private commerce greatly developed. In 1953, the turnover of the former Yong'an Company increased by 70% compared to 1952. The capitalists of the former Yong'an Company boasted that they had a "future." We revolutionary staff deeply understand that if the bourgeoisie has a future, the working class will have no future; if capitalism has a future, socialism will have no future. The capitalists' confession revealed the counter-revolutionary essence of Liu Shaoqi's so-called "joint development."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our country does not establish a socialist economy, what kind of situation will it be in? It will become a country like Yugoslavia, a country that is actually a bourgeois country, and the dictatorship of the proletariat will turn into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and it will be a reactionary, fascist dictatorship." Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices strive to protect and develop the capitalist economy, suppress and strike at the socialist economy, in an attempt to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices were brought to the historical tribunal by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. Their evil plot to restore capitalism was thoroughly smashed. We must respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts, and turn the Dongfanghong Department Store into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    所谓“共同发展”就是发展资本主义

    伟大领袖毛主席在党的七届二中全会的报告中指出：“如果认为我们现在不要限制资本主义，认为可以抛弃‘节制资本’的口号，这是完全错误的，这就是右倾机会主义的观点。”毛主席这一英明指示，体现了无产阶级的根本利益，反映了广大劳动人民的迫切要求。
    但是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇拚命反对党的利用、限制、改造资本主义工商业的政策。党的七届二中全会闭幕不久，他就跑到天津，到处作报告，开座谈会，大肆放毒，进行了一系列的罪恶活动。他竟胡说什么：“公私营是共同发展的”，鼓吹什么“从原料到市场，由国营私营共同商量，共同分配”。
    国营经济与私营经济能够“共同商量”，“共同分配”，“共同发展”吗？根本不能！我们东方红百货商店（旧永安公司）全体革命职工，联系到旧永安公司的情况完全懂得，所谓“共同发展”实质上就是发展资本主义。
    在毛主席的英明领导下，全国人民开展了“三反”、“五反”运动，打退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻。资产阶级在党内的代理人刘少奇慌了手脚，再次弹起“共同发展”的滥调。刘少奇在上海的代理人陈丕显之流也跟着叫喊什么国营商业要赶快“踏步”，让私营商业赶上来“共同发展”。他们对旧永安公司竭尽“关怀照顾”之能事：指令人民银行给以大量贷款，指令百货公司提供大批商品，指令信托公司把机关、团体等集体购货单位大批地介绍给旧永安公司。这样，旧永安公司得到了比国营企业更大的货源，销售了比国营企业更大的热门货，致使一些国营企业的营业额大幅度地下降，旧永安公司的营业额大幅度地上升。这就是刘少奇所鼓吹的“共同发展”所造成的严重恶果！
    在刘少奇“共同发展”黑方针的支持和庇护下，旧永安公司的资本家更加猖狂地向社会主义企业展开了进攻：非法套购国营商店的低价商品，不择手段地到全国各地自由采购物资，以次品充正品，欺骗顾客，牟取暴利。
    由于刘少奇及其在上海的代理人支持资本家向国营商业进攻，一些社会主义商业遭到了损害，而私营商业则大大地得到了发展。一九五三年，旧永安公司的营业额，就比一九五二年增加了百分之七十。旧永安公司的资本家得意忘形地叫嚷他们“有了前途”。我们革命职工深深地懂得，有了资产阶级的前途，就没有工人阶级的前途；有了资本主义的前途，就没有社会主义的前途。资本家的自供，一语道破了刘少奇所谓“共同发展”的反革命本质。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的国家，如果不建立社会主义经济，那会是一种什么状况呢？就会变成南斯拉夫那样的国家，变成实际上是资产阶级的国家，无产阶级专政就会转变为资产阶级专政，而且会是反动的、法西斯式的专政。”刘少奇及其同伙极力保护和发展资本主义经济，排挤和打击社会主义经济，就是妄图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，刘少奇及其同伙被亿万革命人民押上了历史的审判台。他们复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋彻底地破灭了。我们一定要响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，把东方红百货商店办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
