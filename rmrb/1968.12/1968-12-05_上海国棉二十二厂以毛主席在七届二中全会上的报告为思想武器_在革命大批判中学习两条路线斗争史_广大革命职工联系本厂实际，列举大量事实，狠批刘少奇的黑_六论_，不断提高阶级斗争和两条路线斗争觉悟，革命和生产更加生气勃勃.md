The revolutionary workers of Shanghai No. 22 Cotton Mill have used the brilliant document of Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenum of the Second Session of the Party as a powerful ideological weapon. They have fully utilized the counter-revolutionary revisionist in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, as a negative teacher. Through deepening the revolutionary criticism movement, they have launched a mass movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Under the impetus of this movement, the revolutionary workers' consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been continuously raised, and revolution and production have become more vibrant.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The lessons of history are worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly expounded. It is not enough to expound it to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The revolutionary workers of No. 22 Cotton Mill have repeatedly and earnestly studied this latest directive of Chairman Mao, feeling it very close to their hearts. They say that Chairman Mao's latest directive and Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenum of the Second Session of the Party are the best textbooks, best guides, and best weapons for the struggle between the two lines. To earnestly study the history of the struggle between the two lines, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is the fundamental guarantee for the victorious development of all tasks in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. It is the most important task at present. For this purpose, they have adopted the following effective measures to deepen the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines throughout the mill.

First, they enthusiastically praise the great achievements of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, clearly distinguishing between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, so that one line—the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao—and one viewpoint—the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought viewpoint on class, class struggle, and the continuation of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat—are deeply rooted in the minds of the broad revolutionary workers.

They have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The members of the revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary workers together study Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenum of the Second Session of the Party and Chairman Mao's series of latest directives during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They discuss in depth the glorious, correct, and glorious history of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China growing and strengthening under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They talk about the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They discuss the situation of class struggle, two roads, and two lines before and after liberation in their own mill. Through the remembrance and comparison of the history of the struggle between the two lines, the broad revolutionary workers have further aroused their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the great Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The workers say, the more we study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the closer we feel to Chairman Mao, and the more we hate Liu Shaoqi.

In the study process, the workers particularly excitedly recalled the scene of Chairman Mao's inspection of No. 22 Cotton Mill on January 10, 1956. That day, as soon as Chairman Mao arrived at the factory, he went to the workshop. Along the way, he frequently waved to everyone and greeted the workers warmly. Some workers had oily hands, wiping them on their clothes again and again, but Chairman Mao had already extended his hand, shaking hands warmly with the oil workers, janitors, loom tenders, and machine repairmen. Wherever Chairman Mao appeared, the shout of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed throughout the factory. Many workers who had shaken hands with Chairman Mao recalled this happy moment at the study meeting, saying excitedly, "Chairman Mao is so kind and caring to us workers, completely heart to heart with us!"

Second, they link the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in their own mill, severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's "six articles," and study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party in the revolutionary criticism movement.

The revolutionary workers of No. 22 Cotton Mill use the time before and after shifts to hold workshop criticism meetings and team criticism meetings, using Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's "six articles" and fight against a handful of capitalist-roaders and reactionary capitalists within the mill.

In the revolutionary criticism movement, the workers angrily exposed and criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and restoring capitalism in this mill in April 1957. When Liu Shaoqi came to this mill, he immediately stuck closely with the capitalists in the mill. When he went to the workshop, he did not even look at or acknowledge the workers, but kept chatting with the capitalists. After he had talked enough with the capitalists and happily accepted a dozen shirts of one hundred and twenty threads given by the capitalists, he slipped away. In this "visit," this scoundrel vigorously advocated the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the merits of exploitation," shamelessly praising the big capitalists in the mill as "young and beautiful managers," saying that the capitalists had "rich experience in managing factories" and that the capitalist-roaders in the mill should "fully play the active role of capitalists in managing enterprises." Under the protection of Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, some reactionary capitalists in the mill who had brutally suppressed workers before liberation became the "heroes" of managing the factory, were promoted, and usurped the power of some departments in the mill. When the whole mill held a workers' representative conference, the capitalist-roaders let the capitalists sit on the platform, and even the mill party committee invited the capitalists to participate in the meeting. These capitalists were arrogant, receiving high salaries and doing the work of restoring capitalism. Whenever they had the chance, they counterattacked the workers. A capitalist's desk was placed according to the direction defined by a "feng shui master," and this desk was aimed at the factory gate, not allowing anyone to move it. A worker moved a chair of the capitalist, and the capitalist reported it to the old municipal committee. Liu Shaoqi's agents Chen Pishan and Cao Qiaojun severely reprimanded the worker.

In the big criticism and exposure, the workers, when talking about these facts, were filled with indignation, denouncing Liu Shaoqi's various reactionary fallacies. An elderly female worker excitedly said: I entered this mill as a "training worker" at the age of eight, eating stale porridge and rotten pickles, living in a "pigeon coop" that was open on all four sides, wearing a broken single garment all four seasons, suffering endless oppression and exploitation from the capitalists. While the capitalists' mills were getting bigger and bigger, their houses were getting bigger and bigger, and their cars were getting more and more luxurious. Who fed whom? What "merits of exploitation," this is completely the logic of robbers! Exploitation is a crime! A female loom tender listed a series of shocking class struggle facts in the mill, saying that Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" was completely to incite the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat and to restore capitalism. She said that soon after Liu Shaoqi came to the mill to spread poison, the reactionary capitalists took the opportunity of the Party's rectification movement and various occasions to spew out one poisonous arrow after another, launching a fierce attack on the Party. In 1962, when the Kuomintang reactionaries clamored to invade the mainland, this group of reactionary capitalists thought the time had come, more openly and maliciously spreading various counter-revolutionary statements, fiercely attacking the Party and the working class. She said, fortunately, Chairman Mao initiated this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, digging out the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, enabling us to seize back the part of the power in the mill usurped by the capitalist-roaders; otherwise, we would have to suffer again.

Third, they seize the facts of the struggle between the two lines in society and within the mill at present, carry out education to carry the struggle between the two lines through to the end, so that the broad workers deepen their understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principle of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and further raise their consciousness of consciously carrying out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the course of carrying out the study movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, this mill, in conjunction with the comprehensive implementation of the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session of the Party, has taken the criticism of the "February Countercurrent" in 1967, which opposed the decisions of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Session of the Party, opposed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and opposed the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and the evil wind of reversing the "February Countercurrent" this spring as an important content. The workers, in the discussion and study meetings, listed a large number of facts to prove that the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao are the greatest, most necessary, and most timely. They also, through severely criticizing and fighting against a small handful of class enemies recently unearthed, further deeply realized the correctness and wisdom of Chairman Mao's great teaching that "in China, in our Party, this kind of struggle will have to continue, at least for another twenty years, perhaps for half a century, in short, until the classes are completely eliminated, the struggle will cease." They resolutely declared that they would carry the struggle between the two lines through to the end, thoroughly eliminate Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line firmly take root in the hearts of the broad masses, and ensure that our great socialist iron and steel fortress will never change color for thousands of years!

    上海国棉二十二厂以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为思想武器
    在革命大批判中学习两条路线斗争史
    广大革命职工联系本厂实际，列举大量事实，狠批刘少奇的黑“六论”，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，革命和生产更加生气勃勃
    据新华社上海二日电　上海国棉二十二厂广大革命职工，以毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告这一光辉文献为强大思想武器，充分利用党内头号走资派刘少奇这个反面教员，通过深入开展革命大批判，掀起了学习党内两条路线斗争历史的群众运动。在这个运动的推动下，广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，革命和生产搞得生气勃勃。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”国棉二十二厂的革命职工，反复认真地学习毛主席的这一最新指示，感到非常亲切。他们说，毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告，是进行两条路线斗争的最好教材，最好指南，最好武器。认真学习两条路线斗争的历史，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，是推动斗、批、改各项任务胜利发展，夺取文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证，是当前头等重要的大事。为此，他们采取了以下一些有效作法，在全厂更深入地展开了两条路线斗争史的学习运动。
    一、热烈赞颂以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的丰功伟绩，划清毛主席革命路线和刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的界线，使一个路线——毛主席的革命路线，一种观点——马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于阶级、阶级斗争的观点，关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的观点，在广大革命职工的头脑中深深扎根。
    他们举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，革委会成员和广大革命职工一起大学毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中的一系列最新指示，大议伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党在毛主席革命路线的光辉照耀下成长、壮大的战斗历程，大讲毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果，大谈本厂解放前后两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的情况。通过两条路线斗争史的回忆对比，广大革命职工更加激发了对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱。工人们说，越学两条路线斗争史，我们对毛主席越亲，对刘少奇越恨。
    在学习过程中，工人们特别兴奋地回忆了一九五六年一月十日伟大领袖毛主席视察国棉二十二厂的情景。这天，毛主席一来工厂就到车间，一路上频频向大家挥手致意，不断和工人们握手问好。有的工人满手油垢，在身上揩了又揩，但是毛主席早已伸出巨手，同加油工、勤杂工、挡车工、机修工等亲切握手。毛主席出现在那里，那里就发出轰动全厂的“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声。许多和毛主席握过手的工人在学习会上回忆到这个幸福的时刻，都激动地说：“毛主席对我们工人那么亲切，那么关怀，完全和我们心连心！”
    二、联系本厂的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争实际，狠批刘少奇的黑“六论”，在革命大批判中学习党内两条路线斗争史。
    国棉二十二厂革命职工利用班前班后的时间，举行车间批判会、班组批判会，运用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，狠批刘少奇的“六论”，狠斗厂内一小撮走资派和反动资本家。
    在革命大批判中，工人们愤怒地揭发、批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇一九五七年四月跑到这个工厂来推行反革命修正主义路线、复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。刘少奇当年一到这个厂，就和厂里的资本家亲亲热热地贴在一起。下车间时，他对工人们看也不看，理也不理，一个劲儿地和资本家说个不停。等他和资本家谈够了，并且欣然接受了资本家送的一打一百二十支纱的汗衫，就溜走了。在这次“访问”中，这个工贼大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功论”，无耻地吹捧厂里的大资本家是“年轻漂亮的经理”，胡说什么资本家“有办厂丰富经验”，要厂内走资派“充分发挥资本家管理企业的积极作用”。在刘少奇等党内一小撮走资派的庇护下，厂里一些在解放前血腥镇压过工人的反动资本家成了办厂的“功臣”，升了官，篡夺了厂内一些部门的大权。全厂开工人代表大会时，走资派让资本家坐上主席台，甚至厂党委开会也请资本家参加。这些资本家一个个气焰嚣张，他们拿着高工资，干着复辟资本主义的勾当，一有机会就向工人反攻倒算。有个资本家的写字台是根据“风水先生”定的方向放的，这个写字台对准厂门，不准任何人移动。有个职工动了资本家一把椅子，资本家直告到旧市委，刘少奇的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋就狠狠训斥了工人。
    在大批大揭中，工人们一谈到这些事实，个个义愤填膺，痛斥刘少奇的各种反动谬论。一个老年女工激动地说：我八岁进这个厂做“养成工”，吃的是馊粥臭咸菜，住的是四面通风的“鸽子棚”，一身破单衣穿春夏秋冬四季，受尽了资本家的压迫和剥削。而资本家的厂越开越多，洋房越住越大，小汽车越坐越漂亮。到底是谁养活了谁？什么“剥削有功”，这完全是强盗逻辑！资本家剥削就是有罪！一个挡车女工列举厂里一系列触目惊心的阶级斗争事实证明说，刘少奇鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，完全是为了鼓动资产阶级向无产阶级进攻，是为了复辟资本主义。他说，就在刘少奇到厂放毒后不久，反动资本家利用党整风的机会，利用各种场合，大发谬论，射出了一支又一支毒箭，向党猖狂进攻。一九六二年国民党反动派叫嚣要窜犯大陆，这批反动资本家又以为时机已到，更加露骨地、恶毒地放出各种反革命言论，疯狂地向党和工人阶级进攻。她说，幸亏毛主席发动了这次无产阶级文化大革命，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇挖了出来，使我们夺回了厂里被走资派窃据的那部分权力，要不然，我们就要吃二遍苦。
    三、抓住当前社会上和厂内两条路线斗争的事实，开展把两条路线斗争进行到底的教育，使广大职工加深理解毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的伟大意义，进一步提高贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。
    这个厂在开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，结合全面落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，把批判一九六七年的那股反对八届十一中全会决定、反对无产阶级文化大革命、反对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的“二月逆流”和今春为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风作为一个重要内容。工人们在座谈学习中，列举大量事实证明，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，所取得的成绩是最大最大最大的，是完全必要的和非常及时的。他们还通过狠批狠斗最近挖出来的一小撮阶级敌人，进一步深刻认识到毛主席“在中国，在我党，这一类斗争，看来还得斗下去，至少还要斗二十年，可能要斗半个世纪，总之要到阶级完全灭亡，斗争才会止息”这一伟大教导的无比正确，无比英明。他们坚决表示，一定要把两条路线斗争进行到底，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，让毛主席的革命路线牢牢扎根在广大群众的心上，保证我们伟大的社会主义铁打江山千秋万代永不变色！
