"Voice of the Thai People" Radio Celebrates New Victories of People's Armed Forces in Phrae, Phichit, and Lampang
Thai People Resolved to Drive Out American Aggressors
The Paper Tiger Nature of U.S.-Thai Reactionaries Further Exposed, No Matter How They Struggle, They Cannot Escape a Shameful Defeat

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated December 16, "Voice of the Thai People" Radio broadcasted an article on December 14, enthusiastically celebrating the recent brilliant victories of the people's armed forces in northern Thailand's Phrae, Phichit, and Lampang, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand.

The article stated that from November 21 to December 11, the people's armed forces in the three provinces of Phrae, Phichit, and Lampang launched a fierce offensive against the U.S.-Thanom group in the border areas of the three provinces. According to incomplete statistics, the people's armed forces in these three provinces killed and wounded approximately one hundred enemy soldiers during the battle, shot down and damaged six enemy helicopters, destroyed and damaged multiple enemy vehicles, and burned down several command centers of the U.S.-Thanom group. This brilliant victory of the people's armed forces has struck fear into the hearts of the U.S.-Thanom group.

The article said that during the battle, the people's armed forces demonstrated a spirit of revolutionary heroism, fearing neither hardship nor death, daring to struggle and daring to win. They fought continuously, giving the enemy no chance to catch their breath. The people's armed forces flexibly applied Chairman Mao Zedong's strategies and tactics for people's war. Men, women, old, and young all took part, actively joining the fight. They collectively devised strategies and created traps, bamboo spikes, spears, and landmines, effectively striking and annihilating the enemy, turning every piece of land into a grave for the enemy, fully demonstrating the boundless power of people's war.

The article further stated that the people's armed forces also employed the tactic of "surrounding the point to attack the reinforcements," effectively striking the enemy's reinforcement troops. The people's armed forces once surrounded a group of enemies in Phu Khao Thong, Lampang. When the enemy sent fifty police officers to rescue them, they fell into the people's armed forces' encirclement. The enemy sent more reinforcements, but they were again attacked by the people's armed forces.

The article emphasized that this brilliant victory in the battle is a brilliant victory of the people's armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand. It is a brilliant victory of the Thai Communist Party's adherence to the armed struggle line based on Chairman Mao Zedong's thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." It is a brilliant victory of people's war. At the same time, it is another defeat for the U.S.-Thanom group, further exposing their paper tiger nature to the people.

The article said that the brilliant victories of the people's armed forces and the people in Phrae, Phichit, and Lampang greatly inspired and encouraged the fighting spirit of the Thai people. They are full of confidence in victory and are determined, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, to resolutely wage people's war, drive out the American aggressors from Thailand, overthrow the Thanom sellout group, and establish a people's government.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated December 17, "Voice of the Thai People" Radio broadcasted on December 16 that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the people's armed forces have been continuously striking the reactionary armed forces of the U.S.-Thanom group in Phrae, Phichit, and Lampang, achieving new victories and greatly inspiring the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people nationwide.

The radio station said that according to incomplete statistics, from December 11 to 15, the people's armed forces and people in Phrae, Phichit, and Lampang annihilated nearly fifty enemies, shot down multiple enemy helicopters, and seized a batch of weapons and military supplies.

The radio station said that on December 15, the people's armed forces in Phichit Province ambushed a patrol of the U.S.-Thanom group on the public road in Lung Tao County, killing seven enemies and wounding four. On December 12, the people's armed forces attacked a "commando" outpost of the enemy in the village of Wan Ta Phak, Lung Tao County, annihilating multiple enemies and damaging an enemy helicopter. On the same day, the people's armed forces also wounded two enemy patrolmen in the village of Wan Ta Phak.

The radio station said that with the close support of the people, the people's armed forces in Lampang Province besieged a "commando" unit of the U.S.-Thanom group in the village of Wan Khao Tao, Lang Suan County, for more than ten days. The U.S.-Thanom group dispatched aircraft to try to air-drop supplies to the besieged enemies. However, the air-dropped supplies fell into the hands of the people's armed forces. On December 12, the people's armed forces fiercely attacked the enemies who came to suppress the people in a village just two kilometers away from the enemy outpost. On December 12 and 13, the people's armed forces continuously attacked multiple outposts of the U.S.-Thanom group near the village of Wan Khao Tao, annihilating a batch of enemies.

The radio station said that on December 11, the people's armed forces in Na Khae District, Phrae Province, attacked a "commando" unit of the U.S.-Thanom group, killing and wounding five enemies. On December 13, the people's armed forces again attacked the enemy's so-called "suicide squad," wounding three enemies. In addition, a "special combat team" sent from Tak Province by the U.S.-Thanom group to suppress the people also stepped on a landmine set by the people's armed forces, injuring three.

The radio station pointed out that the consecutive victories of the people's armed forces in these three provinces have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thanom group and greatly inspired the revolutionary people nationwide, setting an example of bravely fighting the enemy.

The radio station reported that under the heavy blows of the people's armed forces, the Thanom-Babo sellout group was in a state of panic. On December 14, the puppet prime minister Thanom personally led a group of reactionary military and police leaders to Phrae, Phichit, and Lampang to direct the suppression of the people.

The radio station pointed out that the desperate struggles of the Thanom sellout group do not show their strength but rather expose their paper tiger nature. No matter how desperately they struggle, they cannot escape a shameful defeat.

    美泰反动派纸老虎本质进一步暴露，不管怎样垂死挣扎都逃脱不了可耻的失败
    据新华社十六日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十四日广播一篇文章，热烈欢呼泰国共产党领导下的北部彭世洛、碧差汶和黎府人民武装最近取得的新的辉煌胜利。
    文章说，从十一月二十一日到十二月十一日，泰国北部彭世洛、碧差汶和黎府人民武装在三府交界地区向美国—他侬集团发动猛烈进攻。据不完全统计，这三个府的人民武装在战斗中共打死打伤敌人约一百名，击落击伤敌人直升飞机六架，炸毁炸坏敌人军车多辆，烧毁美国—他侬集团的“指挥部”多处。人民武装的这一辉煌胜利使美国—他侬集团魂飞胆丧。
    文章说，人民武装在战斗中表现出不怕苦、不怕死，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命英雄主义精神，连续作战，不给敌人以喘息机会。人民武装灵活机动运用毛泽东主席关于人民战争的战略战术。男女老少一起出动，积极投入战斗。他们在战斗中共同出谋献策，创造出陷阱、竹尖、梭镖、地雷等土制武器，有效地打击和消灭敌人，使每一块土地都成为敌人的坟墓，充分表现出人民战争的无穷威力。
    文章接着说，人民武装还运用了“围点打援”的战术，有力地打击敌人的增援部队。人民武装曾在黎府普启陶包围一批敌人，当敌人派遣五十名警察去援救时，却落入人民武装的包围圈。敌人再次增派援兵，又遭到人民武装袭击。
    文章强调指出，这次战斗的辉煌胜利，是泰国共产党领导下的人民武装的辉煌胜利，是泰共根据毛泽东主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想，坚持武装斗争路线的辉煌胜利，是人民战争的辉煌胜利。同时也是美国—他侬集团的又一次惨败，使人民更进一步看清它们的纸老虎本质。
    文章说，彭世洛、碧差汶和黎府人民武装和人民的辉煌胜利，大大激励和鼓舞了泰国人民的斗争意志，他们满怀胜利信心，决心在泰国共产党的领导下，坚决进行人民战争，把美国侵略者赶出泰国，推翻他侬卖国集团，建立人民的政府。
    新华社十七日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台十六日广播，在泰国共产党领导下的人民武装，连日来在彭世洛、碧差汶和黎府再接再厉地打击美国—他侬集团的反动武装，取得了新的战果，大大地鼓舞了全国革命人民的斗志。

    电台说，碧差汶府人民武装十五日在隆告县公路伏击美国—他侬集团的巡逻队，打死敌人七名，打伤四名。十二日，人民武装曾在隆告县万塔拍村袭击敌人一个“别动队”的据点，消灭敌人多名，并且打坏了敌人的一架直升飞机。同一天，人民武装还在万塔拍村打伤两名敌人巡逻队员。
    电台说，黎府人民武装在人民密切支援下，在浪使县万其陶村围困美国—他侬集团的“别动队”达十多天。美国—他侬集团出动飞机，企图以空投来接济这批被包围的敌人。但是，空投物资却落在人民武装手里。人民武装曾在十二日在离敌人据点仅二公里的一个村庄里痛击了前往镇压人民的敌人。十二、十三日，人民武装还连续进攻在万其陶村附近的美国—他侬集团据点多处，歼灭了一批敌人。
    电台说，彭世洛府那空泰县人民武装十一日进攻美国—他侬集团的“别动队”，打死打伤敌人五名。十三日人民武装又袭击敌人的所谓“敢死队”，打伤敌人三名。此外，美国—他侬集团从达府调遣前往镇压人民的“特种战斗队”也中了人民武装埋下的地雷，三人受伤。
    电台指出，这三个府人民武装接连取得胜利，沉重地打击了美国—他侬集团，大大地鼓舞了全国革命人民，树立了一个英勇杀敌的榜样。
    这家电台报道，在人民武装的沉重打击下，他侬—巴博卖国集团恐慌万状。十四日，傀儡总理他侬亲自出马率领一批反动军警头目飞到彭世洛、碧差汶和黎府指挥镇压人民。
    电台指出，他侬卖国集团的疯狂挣扎并不表现它的强大，反而表现出它的纸老虎本质，不管它怎样拚死地挣扎，都逃脱不了可耻的失败。
