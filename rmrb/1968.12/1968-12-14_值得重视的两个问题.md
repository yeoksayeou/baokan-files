The suggestions made by Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu, along with the editorial note from the *People's Daily*, have sparked an unprecedented enthusiasm among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants for running schools. Currently, there are two issues that deserve attention:

1. Primary schools run by production brigades should include junior and senior high school classes.

In the past, under the influence of Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line, the distribution of schools was very unreasonable, resulting in the phenomenon where "the children of poor and lower-middle peasants have few primary school students, it is difficult to find middle school students, and university students are hard to come by." Take our Lishu County as an example: the entire county has 34 communes, but only 9 junior high schools and 1 senior high school (located in the county seat). Taking Shenyang Commune as an example: it is over 30 li away from the junior high school and over 100 li away from the senior high school. The commune runs an agricultural middle school that can only accommodate over 80 students. Therefore, this commune has over 300 poor and lower-middle peasant children who are unable to attend middle school each year due to the lack and distance of middle schools. After the poor and lower-middle peasants take over the management of the schools, they should establish junior and senior high school classes in the primary schools run by the production brigades, so that most of the children of poor and lower-middle peasants can attend middle school. In the past, attending middle school meant living in the town, staying in high-rise buildings, not using farm tools, and after finishing school, their minds were also changed. That is not the right path.

2. Maintain the glorious tradition of thrift in running schools.

After the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the cultural power, their enthusiasm for running schools was very high, and this spirit is precious. However, some places, in order to save face and show off, started buying lumber, building new buildings, and making desks and chairs from the beginning, determined to "do a good job." Doing so will abandon the good tradition of thrift in running schools and run the risk of being influenced by bourgeois ideas, which should be noted.

The primary schools run by us poor and lower-middle peasants have students carrying manure baskets to school, no classrooms so they study in cow sheds, sitting on dirt platforms to read books, learning from Chairman Mao's books, and receiving class education. Bourgeois intellectuals aren't they criticizing it as "rustic" and "irregular"? But we do not listen to their nonsense, we must maintain the glorious tradition of thrift in running schools, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

    值得重视的两个问题
    侯振民、王庆余两同志的建议和《人民日报》编者按发表以后，广大贫下中农的办学热情空前高涨。目前有两个问题值得重视：
    一、大队办小学应附设初高中班。
    过去，在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线影响下，学校的分布很不合理，形成了“贫下中农的子女，小学生较少，中学生难找，大学生看不着”的现象。就拿我们梨树县来说，全县三十四个公社，仅有九所初级中学，一所高级中学（设在县城）。以沈洋公社为例：离初级中学三十多里，离高级中学一百多里，社办一所农中，只能容纳八十多名学生。因此，这个公社每年都有三百多名贫下中农子女因中学太少太远，被卡在门外。贫下中农管理学校以后，要在大队办的小学里，附设初、高中班，省得大多数贫下中农的子女念不上中学。象过去，念中学蹲城镇，住高楼，锹镐不动，书念完了，心也念变了，那不是正道儿。
    二、要保持勤俭办学的光荣传统。
    贫下中农掌管文权以后，办学的积极性很高，这种精神是可贵的。但是，有些地方为争口气，长长脸，开始办学就买木料，盖新房，打桌凳，决心“好好”干一场。这样做就会丢掉勤俭办学的好传统，有沾染“洋气”的危险，应引起重视。
    我们贫下中农办的小学，学生背着粪筐上学，没有教室就在牛棚里上课，坐在土台子上念书，学的是毛主席的书，上的是阶级教育课。资产阶级知识分子不是骂它“土气”、“不正规”吗？可是，我们不听他们那一套鬼话，一定要保持勤俭办学的光荣传统，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。
