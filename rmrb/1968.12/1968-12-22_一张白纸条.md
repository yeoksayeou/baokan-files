After dinner, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Meijiazhuang in Dingningdian District, Ding County, Hebei Province, gathered around a kerosene lamp with more than ten soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They were criticizing the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, criticizing him, and criticizing him fiercely!

Just as everyone was speaking passionately, soldier Xiao Li escorted seventy-something-year-old Grandpa Zhao into the meeting. Grandpa Zhao heard that everyone was criticizing Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." He immediately became furious. He casually took out a white paper slip he had kept for twenty-five years from his pocket and said to everyone: The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "Never forget class struggle." This great teaching of Chairman Mao is the fundamental guarantee for our everlasting happiness. But Liu Shaoqi talks nonsense about class struggle being "extinguished," claiming that the landlord class has been basically eliminated, the bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated, and counter-revolutionaries have been basically eliminated. This is sheer nonsense. Class struggle has not ended, and this "white paper slip" is the best iron-clad evidence.

Meijiazhuang had 170 households before liberation. More than 30 households begged for food, 72 households had sold their children, and 90 percent worked for landlords, being exploited by landlords from eight villages. After the Japanese invaders came, people in Meijiazhuang starved to death, were forced to die, or were killed every day. Meijiazhuang became a "burial village."

One day in 1942, before the Japanese invaders came to "sweep," a rich peasant element secretly pasted white paper slips on the doors of military dependents and village cadres. After the Japanese entered the village, they burned down all the houses of the military dependents and cadres. Twenty-five years later, during the Cultural Revolution, this rich peasant element surfaced again, treating people to meals and distributing some white paper slips, asking everyone to write his name on them and elect him as the team leader, attempting to usurp the leadership of the production team. However, the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought saw through his wolfish ambitions at a glance and did not fall for his tricks! His plot failed.

The "white paper slip" reflects the sharp and complex class struggle history of Meijiazhuang.

After Grandpa Zhao recounted the origin of the "white paper slip" with indignation, he loudly said: The great traitor, great internal enemy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi insists on advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." He wants to extinguish the revolutionary flame lit by the Communist Party, and he wants to extinguish the power in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. He dreams of using the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" as a soft knife to cut off our heads, the poor and lower-middle peasants. We will not agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways!

Grandpa Zhao's powerful criticism struck a heavy blow against the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, giving everyone a vivid lesson on class struggle. The meeting hall resonated with slogans:

"Never forget class bitterness, always remember blood debt!"

"Down with Liu Shaoqi!"

专栏：革命大批判中的小故事

    一张白纸条
    晚饭后，河北省定县叮咛店区梅家庄贫下中农围在一盏煤油灯下，和十几位解放军战士一道，向大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇开炮，开炮，猛烈开炮！
    正当大伙发言激烈的时候，战士小李扶着七十多岁的赵大爷走进了会场。赵大爷听说大家正在批判刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，顿时火冒三丈。他顺手从兜里掏出一张保存了二十五年的白纸条，对大家说：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。毛主席他老人家这一伟大教导，是保证我们千秋万代永远幸福的根本。可是刘少奇却胡说什么阶级斗争“熄灭”了，“地主阶级早已被消灭了，资产阶级也基本被消灭了，反革命也基本被消灭了”。这纯粹是胡说八道。阶级斗争没有结束，这张“白纸条”就是最好的铁证。
    梅家庄解放前有一百七十户人家，三十多户要饭，七十二户卖过儿女，百分之九十给地主扛活，受八个村的地主剥削。日本鬼子入侵后，梅家庄天天有人饿死，被逼死，杀死。梅家庄变成了“埋人庄”。
    一九四二年的一天，日本鬼子来“扫荡”以前，村里的一个富农分子偷偷地在军属和村干部门口贴上白纸条，鬼子进村后，把全村的军属和干部的房子都烧光了。二十五年后，这个富农分子在文化大革命中跳了出来，请客吃饭，又散发一些白纸条，要大家写上他的名字，选他当队长，妄想篡夺生产队的领导权。可是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众一眼就看穿了他的狼子野心，没有上他的当！他的阴谋落空了。
    “白纸条”反映了梅家庄多么尖锐复杂的阶级斗争史。
    赵大爷怀着满腔怒火叙述了“白纸条”的来历后，高声地说：大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇硬要鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，他要熄的是共产党点燃起来的革命烈火，他想灭的是贫下中农手里的权。他梦想用“阶级斗争熄灭论”这个软刀子杀我们贫下中农的头，我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！
    赵大爷有力的批判，狠狠地打击了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，给大家上了一堂生动的阶级斗争课。会场里响起了一片口号声：
    “不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”
    “打倒刘少奇！”
                      挺进
