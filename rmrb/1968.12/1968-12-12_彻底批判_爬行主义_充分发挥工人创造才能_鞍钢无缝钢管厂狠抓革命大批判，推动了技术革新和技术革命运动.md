The revolutionary committee of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," has led the workers to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize the "crawlingism" promoted by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents on the scientific and technological front. This has driven the movement for technological innovation and technological revolution.

The capitalist-roaders in the Seamless Steel Tube Plant were filled with servile thoughts towards foreigners. They not only regarded bourgeois technical "authorities" as gods, but also treated foreign equipment as sacred. They would not allow anyone to touch a single screw! When workers discovered problems with the equipment and proposed reforms, they obstructed and prevented them from doing so. The capitalist-roaders, in order to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and "crawlingism" of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, established a "Chief Engineer's Office," "Technical Work Team," and "Technical Supervision and Inspection Station" in the factory. In the workshops, they also set up a complete technical system. They used this system to allow bourgeois technical "authorities" to control all production and technical affairs in the factory, oppressing, restricting, and punishing the workers, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, and seriously hindering the development of socialist production.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all revolutionary workers in the factory took up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and seized the leadership of production and technology from the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities." They then abolished the entire set of old institutions that promoted "crawlingism" and reformed some of the foreign frameworks that restrained the workers' socialist initiative and creativity. In this situation, some people thought that since everything that needed to be reformed had been reformed, they could just focus on production from now on. However, the factory revolutionary committee and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the factory believed that without thoroughly criticizing "crawlingism," the creative power of the workers could not be fully mobilized. They therefore organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes and led the workers to deeply criticize the harm of "crawlingism" through the method of comparing the old and the new. The workers said: "Previously, when producing a thin-walled steel pipe, following the 'procedures' of foreign teachings, the qualification rate could only reach about 50%. Workers reflected that the 'procedures' had problems, affecting product quality." The capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" insisted that it was because the workers had not strictly followed the operating procedures. Later, the workers summarized a set of experiences based on their own practices, raising the product qualification rate to over 98%. This fully proves that those foreign teachings served "crawlingism." Through exposure and criticism, the workers realized that those few "slaves of foreigners" were not only reactionary in politics but also had nothing special in technology. The workers said: "The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries want to strangle us. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents want to tie our hands and feet with a set of foreign frameworks, slowing down the steps of socialist construction. This is impossible. We must smash these bad elements, along with their foreign frameworks, and throw them into the garbage heap of history!"

Through repeated and continuous criticism of "crawlingism," the broad masses of workers quickly raised their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, and their spiritual outlook was completely renewed. In the past, the capitalist-roaders regarded "foreign" equipment as a "deity," saying, "You can't touch the deity's head." Now the workers say: "What is the deity? Only slaves of foreigners would kneel before the deity and become its slaves!" In the past, the capitalist-roaders said: "Without data or equipment, some advanced products cannot be made. It's better to produce more 'common goods.'" Now the workers say: "We have Mao Zedong Thought and the correct leadership of the revolutionary committee. We can produce any advanced product!" They fully mobilized their creative abilities, carried out technological innovation and technological revolution, and successfully trial-produced 61 new products from January to September this year. Among them, some steel varieties, specifications, and models have already entered the world's advanced ranks.

    彻底批判“爬行主义”
    充分发挥工人创造才能
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂狠抓革命大批判，推动了技术革新和技术革命运动
    新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，发动工人群众用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠批党内头号走资派刘少奇及其代理人在科学技术战线上推行的“爬行主义”，推动了技术革新和技术革命运动。
    无缝钢管厂的走资派一脑袋洋奴思想，他们不仅把资产阶级技术“权威”奉若神明，对洋设备也看成是“佛爷眼珠”，不准动一个螺丝！工人发现设备有问题，提出改革意见，他们横加阻拦，不许改革。走资派为了推行叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线和他的“爬行主义”，在厂部设立了“总工程师室”、“技术工作队”、“技术监督检查站”等，在车间也设置了一整套技术系统，他们利用这一套让资产阶级技术
  “权威”总揽全厂一切生产技术大权，对工人进行管、卡、压、罚，实行资产阶级专政，严重地阻碍了社会主义生产的发展。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，全厂革命职工奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，从走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”手中夺回了生产技术领导大权，接着又把推行“爬行主义”的一整套旧机构取消，对一些束缚工人社会主义积极性和创造性，为“爬行主义”服务的洋框框也进行了改革。在这种情况下，有少数人觉得该改革的已经改革了，以后只要好好生产就行了。但是，厂革委会和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队认为，如果不彻底批判
  “爬行主义”，就不能充分发挥工人群众的创造力。于是，他们大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织职工通过新旧对比的方法，深挖深揭“爬行主义”的危害。工人们说：“以前生产一种薄壁钢管，按照洋教条的‘规程’操作，合格率只能达到百分之五十左右。工人反映：‘规程有问题，影响产品质量。’而走资派和资产阶级技术‘权威’硬说是‘工人没有认真执行操作规程’。后来，工人根据自己的实践，总结出一套经验，使产品合格率提高到百分之九十八以上。这充分说明那些洋教条是为‘爬行主义’服务的。”通过揭露、批判，职工们认识到走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”那一小撮“洋奴才”不仅在政治上是反动的，在技术上也没有什么了不起。工人们说：“帝修反想掐咱们的脖子，大叛徒刘少奇和他的代理人想用一套洋框框捆住咱们的手脚，拖住社会主义建设的步伐，这是办不到的。咱们就是要把这些坏家伙，连同他们的那些洋框框统统砸烂，扫进历史的垃圾堆！”
    无缝钢管厂通过反复、不断批判“爬行主义”，广大工人群众迅速地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，精神面貌焕然一新。过去，走资派把“洋”设备尊为“太岁”，说什么“太岁头上不能动土。”现在工人说：“‘太岁’算老几！只有洋奴才才拜倒在‘太岁’跟前作它的奴隶！”过去，走资派说：“一无资料二无设备，一些尖端产品搞不了。还是多生产‘大路货’。”现在，工人说：“咱们一有毛泽东思想，二有革委会的正确领导。什么尖端产品也能生产！”他们充分发挥创造才能，大搞技术革新和技术革命，仅今年一到九月份就试制成功了六十一项新产品，其中有的钢种、品种规格都已跃入世界先进行列。
