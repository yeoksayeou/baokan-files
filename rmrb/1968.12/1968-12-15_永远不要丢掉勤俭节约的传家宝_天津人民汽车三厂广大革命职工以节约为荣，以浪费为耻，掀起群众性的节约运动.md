Under the brilliant guidance of the Communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary workers of the Tianjin Automobile Factory No. 3 have resolutely responded to the great call of Chairman Mao to "save and make revolution." They have launched a vigorous campaign of saving and making revolution.

Soon after the Communiqué was issued, the factory organized study classes and exhibitions on saving and making revolution. These activities deeply educated the revolutionary workers of the entire factory on the struggle between the two lines and on saving and making revolution. The revolutionary workers enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the factory. They combined this with the specific situation of the factory to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building the factory. The capitalist roaders in this factory have been vigorously promoting Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts managing the factory" and "material incentives." They have been indulging in extravagance and waste, squandering a large amount of state resources. A so-called "expert" in technology, detached from actual production, studied "miniature cars," wasting tens of thousands of yuan of state funds. During the revolutionary criticism, the workers angrily said: "The capitalist bosses waste state resources and harm socialist construction. We workers will never agree to this!" Through study and criticism, the revolutionary workers quickly raised their consciousness of saving and making revolution. They realized that saving a drop of oil, a unit of electricity, or a screw is a big issue related to which line is used to build the factory. An old worker said: "The working class is the leading class and the master of the state. We must consciously implement Chairman Mao's instruction to 'build the factory with thrift' and thoroughly change the face of our country's poverty and backwardness. We will build our country into a powerful socialist state."

The revolutionary workers, with heightened awareness, launched a campaign to "find treasures" and "contribute treasures" throughout the factory. In the past, each workshop, for the sake of convenience, set up a "small warehouse," taking a large amount of materials from the factory warehouse and storing them in the "small warehouse," causing hoarding. Some parts and instruments were stored for more than a decade, resulting in new items becoming old and old items becoming scrap. Through criticism, the revolutionary workers realized that hoarding spare parts for small groups is a great waste. Therefore, everyone took action to clean up the "small warehouse." The maintenance team cleared out spare parts worth more than 2,000 yuan in just three days. Workers also "found treasures" from scrap, saving the state a large amount of funds. The maintenance team four, which used to sell each high-pressure oil pipe worth eight yuan to the scrap company as scrap, after the workers' awareness was raised, actively came up with ideas and everyone thought of ways to refurbish and reuse the scrap.

The campaign of saving and making revolution has greatly enhanced the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters of the state. A worker, during a drill, found a small screw and returned to pick it up after the drill. He said: "Although the screw is small, it is a measure of our thoughts. We must regard saving every screw as a bullet fired at Liu Shaoqi!"

    永远不要丢掉勤俭节约的传家宝
    天津人民汽车三厂广大革命职工以节约为荣，以浪费为耻，掀起群众性的节约运动
    本报讯　在党的八届十二中全会公报的光辉照耀下，天津人民汽车三厂广大革命职工，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，掀起轰轰烈烈的节约闹革命的群众运动。
    公报发表后不久，这个厂就举办了关于节约闹革命的学习班和展览会，对全厂革命职工深入地进行两条路线斗争教育和节约闹革命的教育，广大革命职工大颂毛主席的无产阶级建厂路线，结合厂里的具体情况，狠批刘少奇反革命修正主义建厂路线。这个厂的走资派，过去拚命推行刘少奇“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”的反革命修正主义路线，讲排场，闹阔气，大量浪费国家资材。有个资产阶级技术“权威”，脱离生产实际，研究什么“微型汽车”，浪费了国家上万元的资金。在革命大批判中，工人们气愤地说：“资产阶级老爷浪费国家资材，危害社会主义建设，我们工人坚决不答应！”通过大学习，大批判，迅速提高了广大革命职工节约闹革命的自觉性。使他们认识到节约一滴油、一度电、一个螺丝，都是关系到用什么路线建设工厂的大问题。老工人说：“工人阶级是领导阶级，是国家的主人，要自觉执行毛主席‘勤俭办工厂’的指示，彻底改变我国一穷二白的面貌，把我们国家建设成一个强大的社会主义国家。”
    广大革命职工提高了觉悟，全厂掀起了找宝、献宝活动。过去，各个班组为了自己方便，都设立了“小仓库”，从工厂库房里领取大量物资，存放在“小仓库”里积压起来，影响了调配。有的零件、仪表一压十几年，结果使新品变成了旧品，旧品变成了废品。通过大批判，广大革命职工认识到从小团体出发积压备件，是一种很大的浪费。于是，人人动手清理“小仓库”。保养一连，三天清理出来的备件价值达两千多元。工人还从废品中“找宝”，为国家节约了大量资金。保养四连，过去把每根价值八元的高压输油管当废品卖给废品公司，群众提高觉悟以后，积极出主意，人人想办法，把废品加工改造，重新使用。
    节约闹革命的群众运动，大大提高了广大职工国家主人翁的责任感。有个工人出操时，发现一个小螺丝钉，下操后他又返回操场拣了回来。他说：“螺丝钉虽小，但它是检验我们思想的尺度。我们要把节约每一个螺丝钉，看成是射向刘少奇的一颗子弹！”
