Implementing the Struggle, Criticism, and Reform Based on Local Conditions
Hongshui Commune's Immediate Results from Combining Criticism and Reform

Through a series of reforms, people's spirits have been renewed, and the revolutionary and production situations are excellent.

Our reporter reports: Following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform," Hongshui Commune in Qianxi County, Guizhou, has combined its actual situation with the process, criticizing a bit and reforming a bit, taking one step at a time, and closely integrating the struggle, criticism, and reform. The revolutionary and production situations are excellent.

Hongshui Commune's struggle, criticism, and reform began in February this year. Initially, during the criticism process, there was no connection to actual situations, only criticizing revisionism without struggling against selfishness, only criticizing without reforming, resulting in the "four more, four less" phenomenon: more big principles, less connection to reality; more distant criticism, less near criticism; more criticism of others, less of oneself; more criticism, less reform. Thus, criticism meetings became "three days of fishing, two days of drying the nets." The masses reflected: "Our criticism meetings are hot and cold, with thunder but no rain." The commune revolutionary committee studied this situation, found the key problem, and unanimously agreed that the deeper the struggle, criticism, and reform, the sharper the contradiction between "public" and "private." Criticism meetings not connecting to reality and only criticizing without reforming are manifestations of "selfishness." To correct this trend, one must break down "selfishness" and establish "public-mindedness." They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching, "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," and held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The commune, production brigade, and production team held them; even five households and families held them; during farming off-seasons and busy seasons, they held them, and during peak busy seasons, they insisted on holding them. Everywhere became a battlefield for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. The entire commune, with over 1,200 households and 5,600 people, has held over 1,700 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 45,000 participants.

Based on improved understanding, they summarized the problems from the previous phase of struggle, criticism, and reform. Everyone brainstormed and came up with a set of experiences: "one study, two criticisms, three confessions, four struggles, five reforms." Practice proved that this experience is good because it connects to reality, is targeted, has clear struggle objectives, clear criticism targets, clear reform directions, combines criticism with reform, and achieves immediate results, greatly accelerating the pace of struggle, criticism, and reform.

They criticized Liu Shaoqi's "three selfs and one package" black goods, solving the problem of privately cultivated land, with community members voluntarily returning over 400 mu of privately cultivated land; they criticized Liu Shaoqi's "material incentives" and "work points as the commander" black goods, promoting the Dazhai political standard work points system, freeing community members from the shackles of quota management.

Through a series of reforms, the people of Hongshui Commune have renewed their spirits. Now, in this commune, poor and lower-middle peasants actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought as a primary political need, and new people and new deeds emerge continuously. Yang Guonan, a 60-year-old Miao farmer, under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly serves the collective. During the summer harvests of last year and this year, he picked up over 1,400 jin of fallen grains in the fields and drying grounds, all of which he turned over to the collective without asking for any reward. Community members enthusiastically praised him: "Though old, his spirit is not old. He holds high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, eagerly does public deeds, and throws away private matters."

In the struggle, criticism, and reform, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshui Commune have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, mustered their strength, and striven for the upper hand. This year's production situation is excellent. The summer grain procurement exceeded the target by 83%, changing the previous situation of relying on state-returned grain every year. This year, they also sold 30,000 jin of surplus summer grain to the state. Some production brigades have built small hydropower stations, and many brigades have raised funds to purchase walk-behind tractors. The entire commune has added 12 water wheels and water pumps, and built over 200 public rooms and tobacco drying rooms. The development of the collective economy has laid a good foundation for the new leap in agricultural production.

    根据本地区实际情况进行斗批改
    洪水公社边批边改立竿见影
    经过一系列改革，人的精神面貌焕然一新，革命和生产形势一片大好
    本报讯　贵州黔西县洪水公社遵照伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的指示，结合本社实际情况，批一点，改一点，一步一个脚印，使斗、批、改紧密结合起来，革命和生产形势一片大好。
    洪水公社的斗、批、改，是从今年二月开始的。起初，在大批判过程中没有联系实际，光批修不斗私，光批不改，出现了“四多四少”现象：大道理说得多，联系实际少；远的批得多，近的批得少；批人家的多，批自己的少；批判的多，改革的少。这样，批判会就形成“三天打鱼，两天晒网”。群众反映：“咱们的批判会，忽冷忽热，光打雷不下雨。”公社革委会针对这种情况，及时地进行研究，找到了问题的关键，一致认为，斗、批、改越深入，
  “公”和“私”的矛盾越尖锐。批判会不联系实际，光批不改，就是“私”字作怪。要纠正这种倾向，必须大破“私”字，大立“公”字。他们遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。公社办，大队办，生产队办，三家五户办，家庭也办；农闲办，农忙办，大忙坚持办，到处都是斗私批修的战场。全公社一千二百多户，五千六百多人，到目前为止，共开办毛泽东思想学习班一千七百多期次，参加学习的达四万五千多人次。
    在提高认识的基础上，他们根据前一段斗、批、改中存在的问题，人人动脑筋，个个想办法，总结出一条“一学、二批、三诉、四斗、五改”的经验。实践证明，这个经验很好，好就好在：联系实际，有的放矢，斗有目标，批有对象，改有方向，边批边改，立竿见影，大大地加速了斗、批、改的步伐。
    他们批判了刘少奇的“三自一包”黑货，解决了私开荒地的问题，社员自动交回私开荒地四百多亩；他们批判了刘少奇的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”黑货，推行了大寨政治标准工分制，社员从定额管理的枷锁中解放出来。
    经过一系列的改革，洪水公社人的精神面貌焕然一新。现在，这个公社贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想已成为政治生活的第一需要，新人新事层出不穷。六十多岁的苗族老农民杨国安，在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下，一心为集体，去年夏收和今年夏收时，他在地里和晒坝边，共拣落地粮一千四百多斤，全部交给了集体，不要报酬。社员热情地赞扬他：人老志不老，毛泽东思想红旗举得高，为公的事争着干，为私的事他全抛。
    洪水公社广大贫下中农在斗、批、改中，发扬自力更生，奋发图强的精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，今年的生产形势很好，夏粮征购超额百分之八十三完成任务，改变了过去年年吃国家回销粮的状况，今年还卖给国家夏收超产粮三万斤。有的大队新建了小型水电站，不少大队已筹集好了购买手扶拖拉机的资金。全公社新增水轮泵、抽水机十二台，新建公用房和烤烟房二百多间。集体经济的发展，为农业生产新跃进打下了很好的基础。　（本报工人通讯员、本报记者）
