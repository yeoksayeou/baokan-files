The report on the cooperative medical system in Lake Garden Commune truly speaks to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. It shows great concern for the poor and lower-middle peasants and is a great encouragement for us "barefoot doctors." I shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

Based on the current situation in rural areas, I would like to offer the following supplementary suggestions for improving the cooperative medical system:

1. Political thought work must be stressed, and the spirit of helping others selflessly must be promoted.

2. Acupuncture and "folk remedies" should be widely promoted, and the use of medicine should be minimized to consolidate the cooperative medical system.

3. It is suggested that urban doctors go to the countryside to train rural "barefoot doctors" and popularize health knowledge.

4. Political thought education for medical personnel should be strengthened, and the idea of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly, thoroughly, and without fear of hardship or fatigue should be established.

    必须狠抓政治思想工作
    湖北乐园公社实行合作医疗制度的报道，真是说到了我们贫下中农的心坎里，是对贫下中农的巨大关怀，也是对我们“赤脚医生”的巨大鞭策。我千遍万遍地高呼：敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    根据当前农村的实际情况，我对办好合作医疗提出以下几点补充意见：
    一，必须狠抓政治思想工作，发扬助人为乐的革命精神。
    二，大力推广针灸、“土方”，尽量减少药物使用，以利于巩固合作医疗。
    三，建议城市医生下农村，大力培养农村“赤脚医生”，普及卫生知识。
    四，对医务人员要加强政治思想教育，树立完全、彻底，不怕苦不怕累，全心全意为贫下中农服务的思想。
