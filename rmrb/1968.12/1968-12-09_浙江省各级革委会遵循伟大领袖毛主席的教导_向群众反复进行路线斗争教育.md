Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committees at all levels follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and repeatedly conduct education on the struggle between the two lines for the masses.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 8th: Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committees have swiftly mobilized and organized the revolutionary masses throughout the province to launch a study movement on the history of the struggle between the two lines. This has significantly raised the revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promoting the in-depth development of revolutionary criticism and the struggle to criticize and transform.

Recently, in the study classes for members of revolutionary committees at all levels above the commune level held in batches by the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, tens of thousands of students have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." They have also studied Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they immediately took action, using various forms to repeatedly educate the broad revolutionary masses on the history of the struggle between the two lines. Together with the broad revolutionary masses, they studied Chairman Mao's theory on the continuation of the proletarian dictatorship's revolution. The revolutionary committees in Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Lishui, Jiaxing, and Shaoxing have, since the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, led the masses in holding tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, sparking a wave of studying the communiqué and the history of the struggle between the two lines. The revolutionary committee of Meishan Commune in Shaoxing County, upon hearing the broadcast of Chairman Mao's latest instructions that evening, immediately dispatched over two hundred people to form fifteen propaganda teams to go door-to-door in the villagers' homes to propagate and organize the masses to hold study classes to learn about the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party.

In the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, Zhejiang's urban and rural areas have launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism on a grand scale. The 31 million military and civilian personnel across the province, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a fierce criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Zhejiang who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They have thoroughly criticized the 1967 "February Countercurrent" that opposed the decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, opposed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and opposed the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have also criticized the evil wind this spring that sought to reverse the "February Countercurrent." From cities to rural areas, from islands to mountainous regions, criticism meetings with tens of thousands of people are held everywhere, and the battlefield of revolutionary criticism is set up everywhere.

Through serious study of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the party and in-depth revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses in Zhejiang have significantly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, powerfully promoting the ongoing struggle to criticize and transform.

    向群众反复进行路线斗争教育
    据新华社杭州八日电　浙江省各级革命委员会雷厉风行地发动和组织全省广大革命群众开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，大大提高了革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了革命大批判和斗、批、改的深入开展。
    最近，在浙江省革命委员会分批举办的全省公社以上各级革委会成员毛泽东思想学习班上，数万名学员认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告。他们遵照毛主席的最新指示，马上行动起来，运用多种多样形式，反复地向广大革命群众进行两条路线斗争史的教育，和广大革命群众一道，学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说。杭州、温州、丽水、嘉兴、绍兴等地区的各级革委会，自党的八届十二中全会公报发表以来，领导群众举办了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了学习全会公报和两条路线斗争史的热潮。绍兴县梅山公社革委会在听到广播毛主席最新指示的当天晚上，就派出两百多人组成十五个宣传队，到社员家里挨家挨户上门宣传，并且组织群众举办学习班，学习党内两条路线的斗争史。
    浙江各地城乡在学习两条路线斗争史中，掀起了一场声势浩大的革命大批判新高潮。全省三千一百万军民以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在浙江的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底批判那个反对党的八届十一中全会决定、反对无产阶级文化大革命、反对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一九六七年的“二月逆流”和今春那股为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风。全省从城市到农村、从海岛到山区，到处召开成千上万人的批判大会，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。
    浙江各地革命群众通过认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，深入开展革命大批判，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了正在进行的斗、批、改。
