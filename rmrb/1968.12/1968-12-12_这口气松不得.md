The momentous communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a verdict, sentencing the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi to political death; it is a battle cry, sounding the charge to continue to settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for their heinous crimes of betraying the Party and the nation!

As the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country enthusiastically acclaim, study, implement, and propagate the communiqué, they are roused to action, united in hatred of the enemy, and denounce with both pen and sword, fanning the flames of revolutionary criticism higher and higher, raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines higher and higher, and promoting production, work, and preparedness better and better. However, we must also see that in our ranks, a small number of comrades have developed the idea of "relaxing a bit," thinking that "Liu Shaoqi has been swept into the dustbin of history and will never be able to rise again, and the revolutionary criticism has been going on for more than two years. Even if we continue to criticize, it's like hitting a dead bear with an iron hammer, with little meaning." We must remind these comrades: your thinking is problematic, and the breath of revolutionary criticism must not be relaxed!

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hold that throughout the entire historical period of socialism, there exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration. "Under the present circumstances, revisionism is more harmful than dogmatism. One of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to launch a criticism of revisionism." The historical experience of the international communist movement tells us that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, "revisionism" is the greatest danger to the proletarian dictatorship; if the "revisionism" is not overthrown, the state will not be secure; criticizing revisionism is an important basic task for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. In this sense, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a major campaign to criticize revisionism. To ensure that our Party does not change its nature and the country does not change its color, and for the complete liberation of all mankind, we must forever hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and criticize revisionism for life, not stopping until we achieve complete victory!

The great traitor, great internal enemy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi is a thoroughly evil tumor. For a long time, this scoundrel, using the power he usurped, extended his claws into every field and line, spreading his revisionist black goods through various channels, poisoning deeply and widely. Compared with the old revisionists of the world, his poison is only more severe, not less! In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have thoroughly refuted Liu Shaoqi's various revisionist fallacies, criticizing them to the point of being unbearable. However, it is not easy to purge the poison. In fact, to this day, in some units and among some people, Liu Shaoqi's revisionist poison has not been thoroughly purged. For example, in some units, after streamlining the organization, the personnel who were sent down gradually floated back up. Doesn't this prove that the poison of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line of state construction still lingers in some of our comrades? Some comrades still go to the countryside to "labor" with a "gold-plating" attitude. Doesn't this prove that the poison of Liu Shaoqi's "labor gold-plating" and "labor for officialdom" is still corroding our comrades? When Liu Shaoqi was advocating the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," he shouted at the top of his lungs: "The capitalists have already handed over the factories, except for a few individuals, they no longer want to resist socialism," "The main class struggle within the country has basically ended..." Now, some of our comrades think that Liu Shaoqi has been overthrown, and revolutionary criticism can relax a bit. Isn't this the theory of the "extinction of class struggle" still haunting our comrades?... We must see that our revolutionary criticism is not only to overthrow the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, but more importantly, to educate and arm ourselves, so that we can learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, renew our minds, eliminate revisionist poison, and build an iron Great Wall to resist and prevent revisionism! Only in this way can we effectively resist the infiltration of all revisionist thoughts! The great Lenin once taught us: "When the old society is dying, its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried in a grave. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us." We must see that although the political corpse of Liu Shaoqi has been swept into the dustbin of history, it will still rot and stink, and countless germs will corrode our healthy bodies. Therefore, we must use the fiery criticism of the revolution to turn it into ashes!

The revolutionary practice of more than two years has told us that revolutionary criticism is a powerful revolutionary force, a reliable guarantee for winning every victory in the Cultural Revolution. Now, we are shouldering the historic mission of winning a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The task is arduous, and the struggle is complex. However, as long as we firmly grasp the revolutionary direction of struggle, closely combine revolutionary criticism with the work of cleaning up class ranks, rectifying the Party, streamlining organizations, sending office personnel down, and reforming unreasonable regulations and systems, all difficulties will be overcome, and all problems will be solved!

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage, and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." Let us raise the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought higher, with one breath, continue to settle accounts with the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for their heinous crimes of betraying the Party and the nation, and thoroughly purge their poison!

    这口气松不得
    具有伟大历史意义的党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，是判决书，宣判了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇政治上的死刑；是战斗的号角，吹响了继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国滔天罪行的冲锋号！
    全国亿万革命人民在热烈欢呼、认真学习、坚决贯彻、积极宣传公报的时候，闻风而动，同仇敌忾，口诛笔伐，把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺更旺，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟提得更高更高，促进生产、工作、战备搞得更好更好。可是，也应当看到，在我们的队伍里，还有一小部分同志产生了“松口气”的想法，认为“刘少奇已被扫进历史垃圾堆，永世翻不了身啦，革命大批判已经搞了两年多，再批，也不过是往死狗熊身上抡铁锤，没多大意思。”我们有必要提醒这些同志：你的想法很成问题，革命大批判这口气千万松不得！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想认为，在社会主义社会的整个历史时期内，存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。“在现在的情况下，修正主义是比教条主义更有害的东西。我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”国际共产主义运动的历史经验告诉我们，在无产阶级专政条件下，“修”是无产阶级政权的最大危险，“修”字不倒，江山不牢；批修是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的一项重要的基本功。我国的无产阶级文化大革命，在这个意义上说，就是一场批修的大战役。为了保证我们党不变质、国不变色，为了全人类的彻底解放，我们必须永远高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一辈子批判修正主义，不获全胜决不收兵！
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，是一个五毒俱全的大毒瘤。长期以来，这个坏家伙，利用窃取的大权，把魔爪伸到了各个领域中，各条战线上，通过种种渠道，肆无忌惮地推销他的修正主义黑货，流毒之深广，与世界历代老牌修正主义者相比，只有过之而无不及！在无产阶级文化大革命中，全国亿万革命群众奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把刘少奇的种种修正主义谬论驳得体无完肤，批得臭不可闻。但是，要肃清流毒可不是件容易事，事实上，至今在有些单位、有些人身上，刘少奇的修正主义毒素还远没有彻底肃清。比如，有的单位精简机构不久，下放人员又渐渐地浮上来，这不证明刘少奇的修正主义政权建设路线的流毒在我们某些同志的身上还没有彻底肃清吗！有的同志还抱着“镀金”的态度到农村“下放劳动”，这不证明刘少奇的“劳动镀金”
  “劳动做官”的毒素还在侵蚀我们的同志吗！刘少奇在鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”时，曾声嘶力竭地叫嚷过：“资本家已经把工厂交出来了，除开极少数的分子以外，他们已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”，“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了，……”而现在，我们有的同志认为刘少奇被打倒了，大批判可以松口气了，这不是刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”还在我们同志的头脑里作怪吗！……必须看到，我们搞革命大批判，不单是为了把党内头号走资派刘少奇打倒，更重要的是为了教育自己，武装自己，使自己在斗争中学习、运用毛泽东思想，在头脑里“吐故纳新”，清除修正主义毒素，筑起反修防修的钢铁长城。只有这样，才能有效地抵御一切修正主义思想的侵蚀！伟大的列宁曾经教导我们：“旧社会灭亡的时候，它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。”我们必须看到，刘少奇这具政治死尸虽然已被扫进历史的垃圾堆，但它还会腐烂、发臭，无数的毒菌还会腐蚀我们健全的肌体。因此，我们必须用革命大批判的烈火把它烧成灰烬！
    两年多来的革命实践告诉我们，革命的大批判是一种强有力的革命动力，是夺取文化大革命每一个战斗胜利的可靠保证。现在，我们肩负着夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的历史使命，任务是艰巨的，斗争是复杂的。但是，只要我们紧紧把握革命斗争大方向，把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍、整党、精简机构、下放科室人员、改革不合理的规章制度等项工作紧密结合起来，一切困难都会被我们克服，一切问题都将迎刃而解！
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，一鼓作气，继续清算大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其同伙的叛党叛国的滔天罪行，彻底肃清其流毒！
