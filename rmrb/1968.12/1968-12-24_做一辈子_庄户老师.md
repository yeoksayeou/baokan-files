Before 1962, our brigade had a public-run primary school that followed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi. They peddled the black goods of "reading books to become officials," keeping students cooped up in classrooms all day, detached from class struggle, detached from productive labor, and detached from poor and lower-middle peasants. Once, three old poor peasants were drying wheat in the field when suddenly wind, rain, and hail struck all at once. They saw that the brigade's wheat was about to be damaged. The three old men were at their wits' end and rushed to the public-run school to ask the teacher to let the students help them save the wheat. But the answer they got was: "Let the students take a holiday to work? This needs approval from the county education bureau. As a teacher, I have to be responsible for the students' health." The three old poor peasants were so angry that they said, "We don't want a school that doesn't serve the poor and lower-middle peasants!"

It was this year that I graduated from high school and returned to the brigade. Seeing the poor and lower-middle peasants' eager desire to run their own school but not being able to find teachers, I was in a fierce struggle within myself. Should I do it myself? But I felt it was too bad not to go to university after graduating from high school. I brought this question to study Chairman Mao's relevant works. Chairman Mao taught us: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What is the criterion? There is only one criterion, that is, whether he is willing to or not, and whether he actually does or does not, combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's teachings pointed out the direction for me, and I made up my mind to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants and signed up to be a part-time teacher. The poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed. Some said, "Yubi is truly a good youth of the Mao Zedong era." Others said, "Well done, you are a good descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

After becoming a part-time teacher, I taught more in my spare time and led the students to participate in agricultural production during busy farming seasons, studying Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants. When the poor and lower-middle peasants came to the school, I actively reported to them the thoughts of myself and the students. When I had time, I also sought their opinions and actively sought their leadership. Coincidentally, in 1963 during the wheat harvest, it was still those three old men managing the field. One day, another windstorm came, and I led the students to run to the field. The wind was too strong, so we lay on the wheat stacks, ensuring that the wheat was not damaged. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised, "Our own-run primary school and the one run by the county education bureau are truly one in heaven and one on earth."

For the first two years, I went in and out with a big manure basket on my back, wearing a small cotton jacket in winter, just like the poor and lower-middle peasants. The students also all carried big manure baskets, picking up manure as they walked. The poor and lower-middle peasants all affectionately called me "Village Teacher." But later, I was also once poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory. Seeing the public-run school teachers wearing cadre uniforms and riding bicycles, I envied them. I also borrowed money to buy a bicycle and wore a cadre uniform, abandoning the manure basket. When the poor and lower-middle peasants called my name, I didn't want to answer if they didn't call me "teacher." The students also didn't carry manure baskets anymore. Some students even fought with their mothers at home because their clothes were not good enough.

My changes were promptly noticed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. One day, old poor peasants Tan Jingtan and Wu Rongxun came to the school and gave me a class education on not forgetting Chairman Mao after liberation, making me realize that my thoughts were changing, and if I continued, I would not only fall into the bourgeois pit myself but also lead the poor and lower-middle peasants' children astray. Thinking of this, I broke out in a cold sweat. From then on, I sold the bicycle, wore peasant clothes, and carried the manure basket again, just like before. The students also quickly improved.

Our primary school, because the poor and lower-middle peasants directly held the leadership power and implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, the students it trained, whether working in the village or outside, were all welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Our primary school is on the path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, and it is the right path." I deeply felt that as a people's teacher, only by listening to Chairman Mao's words and walking the path of combining with workers and peasants, consciously transforming one's worldview, can one cultivate revolutionary successors who serve proletarian politics. I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind" in the future, continue to accept the poor and lower-middle peasants' re-education, and be a "Village Teacher" welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants for life.

    做一辈子“庄户老师”
    一九六二年以前，俺大队有一所公办小学，执行的是大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线。他们大肆贩卖“读书做官”的黑货，成天把学生关在屋里，脱离阶级斗争，脱离生产劳动，脱离贫下中农。有一次，三个老贫农正在场上晒麦子，突然风雨冰雹一块袭来，眼看生产队的小麦就要受损失。三个老人急得没法，就跑到这所公办的小学请老师让学生帮着抢场。谁知得到的回答却是：“叫学生放假去干活？！这得经县教育局批准，我当老师的要为学生的健康负责。”三个老贫农气得愤恨地说：“不为贫下中农服务的学校，我们不要！”
    正是这一年，我高中毕业回到了大队，看到贫下中农渴望自己办学，但又找不到老师的那股急劲，引起了我思想上的激烈斗争。自己来干吧，又觉得高中毕业不去念大学太可惜。我带着这个问题，学习了毛主席的有关著作。毛主席教导我们：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”毛主席的教导给我指出了方向，我下定决心要为贫下中农服务，报名当了民办教师。贫下中农那股高兴劲就甭说了。有的说：“玉毕不愧是毛泽东时代的好青年。”也有的说：“好样的，是咱贫下中农的好后代。”
    我当了民办教师后，闲时多教，农忙时就带领学生参加农业生产，和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作。贫下中农到学校来的时候，我主动向他们汇报我和学生的思想情况，有时间我也找贫下中农征求意见，主动争取他们的领导。事情也真凑巧，一九六三年麦收，还是那三个老人管场，一天，又遇到了风雨，我就带领学生跑步来到场上。风太大，我们就趴在麦垛上，使小麦没受损失。贫下中农夸奖说：“咱自己办的小学和县教育局办的那个小学，真是一个天上，一个地下。”
    头两年，我出出进进，都背着个大粪筐，冬天穿件小棉袄，和贫下中农没有两样。学生们也个个背起了大粪筐边走边拾粪。贫下中农都亲切地叫我“庄户老师”。可后来我也一度中了刘少奇“读书做官论”的毒。眼看着公办学校老师穿的是干部服，骑的是自行车，很羡慕。我也借钱买了辆自行车，穿上了干部服，撂下了大粪筐。贫下中农再喊我的名字，不叫老师，我也不愿答应了。学生们看我这样，也没有人再背粪筐了，还有些学生因穿的不好，回家和母亲吵架。
    我的变化被贫下中农及时发现了。一天，老贫农谭景堂、武荣训找到了学校，对我进行翻身不忘毛主席的阶级教育，使我认识到，我的思想正在演变，再发展下去，不仅自己会陷入资产阶级的泥坑，还会把贫下中农的子女带到邪路上去。想到这，我出了一身冷汗。从此以后，我卖了自行车，穿起农民衣，背起了大粪筐，又和往常一样了。学生们也很快变好了。
    我们的小学，由于贫下中农直接掌握领导大权，贯彻了毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，教出来的学生，不论是在村里工作的，还是到外面工作的，都很受贫下中农欢迎。贫下中农说：“咱们小学走的是伟大领袖毛主席指引的路，走对了。”我深深体会到，作为一个人民教师，只有听毛主席的话，走与工农相结合的道路，自觉地改造世界观，才能培养出为无产阶级政治服务的革命接班人。我今后一定要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，继续接受贫下中农的再教育，做一辈子受贫下中农欢迎的“庄户老师”。
