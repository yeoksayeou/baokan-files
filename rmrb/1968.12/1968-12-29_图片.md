Medical personnel from a military unit stationed in Heilongjiang Province are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's directives on health work. They have trained a group of part-time medical personnel in rural areas. This is an elderly woman from a poor peasant family who, after recovering from her illness, is deeply grateful to the "barefoot doctor" Xing Yuqin who treated her.
