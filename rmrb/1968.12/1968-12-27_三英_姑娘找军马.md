Mao Zedong Thought nurtures new sprouts, and every sunflower blooms with laughter towards the sun. In the military horse farm under the Helan Mountains in the northwest of our motherland, whenever people mention the “three heroines,” they always talk about their story of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in the midst of a blizzard to search for military horses.

The “three heroines” are three daughters of herdsmen in the farm. The eldest is only seventeen years old. Their names are: Yongshu Ying, Jilan Ying, and Helan Ying. They often propagate Mao Zedong Thought in the farm and help the herdsmen tend to the horses.

One morning, a sudden strong wind and heavy snow swept across the grasslands. The herdsmen thought of the part of the military horses still on the grasslands, and each felt as if their hearts had been cut out. Just as the workers and their families were rushing to go find the military horses, the “three heroines” felt as if a fire had been ignited in their hearts. They remembered the herdsmen uncles often saying, “One military horse is like a cannon!” They mounted their horses and rushed out of the gate. The herdsmen, seeing the “three heroines” going to find the military horses, anxiously shouted, “You can’t go! Such heavy snow and fog, what if you fall into a ravine?!” The “three heroines” firmly replied, “We are young but we must listen to Chairman Mao’s words. We are not afraid of difficulties; saving the horses is the most important!”

The “three heroines” arrived at the grasslands and saw a vast expanse of white snow. Where should they start looking? They recalled the scenes of the Red Army climbing snowy mountains and crossing grasslands in the past, and suddenly felt a surge of strength. They braved the biting wind and snow, running back and forth, calling out to the horses. Suddenly, they discovered a horse under a snow-covered slope. They rushed over and pulled the horse, jumping and singing with joy. “Spurring the horse without dismounting,” the “three heroines” continued their battle. They were not afraid of the cold or fatigue, crossing one hill after another. After seven or eight hours of battle, they finally found all seven of the scattered military horses.

The tense battle ended the day and ushered in the night. The “three heroines,” leading the seven military horses, walked back with joy. The night deepened, and the biting cold wind fiercely assaulted them. After running on the grasslands all day, their cotton clothes, soaked with sweat and snow, were frozen stiff like iron plates. Their trouser legs were frozen rigid and couldn’t bend. Their shoes and socks were frozen to the stirrups. As the horse ran, the icicles on their clothes clinked like a string of bells. At this moment, Yongshu Ying thought of her two companions, who had been riding horses all day without eating or drinking, and asked with concern, “Are you cold and hungry?” The two companions replied in unison, “A little hunger is nothing! Didn’t Comrade Lei Feng say that Chairman Mao’s works are our food? We all have a red sun in our hearts, and we are not afraid of the cold.” Thus, the vast wilderness echoed with their bright voices singing, “Our comrades, in times of difficulty, must see achievements, see the light, and raise our courage.”

The night was already deep. The leaders of the horse team, workers, and families were all worried about the “three heroines,” preparing to send out several search parties. Suddenly, someone shouted, “The ‘three heroines’ are back!” Immediately, everyone rushed out. The “three heroines” were enthusiastically welcomed into the house. Amidst a chorus of praise, the “three heroines” humbly said, “It is Chairman Mao who taught us to do this. Compared to the herdsmen uncles, we still have a long way to go! We must listen to Chairman Mao’s words, be good children of his, and good descendants of the herdsmen.”

    “三英”姑娘找军马
    毛泽东思想育新苗，朵朵葵花朝阳笑。在祖国西北贺兰山下的某军马场里，一提起“三英”姑娘，人们都会讲起她们在暴风雪中活学活用毛主席著作，寻找军马的故事。
    “三英”姑娘是马场三个牧工的孩子，最大的只有十七岁。她们的名字是：拥树英、季兰英、何兰英。她们经常在场里宣传毛泽东思想，帮助牧工同志放马。
    一天清晨，草原上突然刮起了大风，下起了大雪。牧工们想到草滩上还有一部分军马，个个象割掉了心头肉一样。就在职工和家属们争着要进滩去找军马的时候，“三英”姑娘心头好象燃起了一团火。她们想到牧工叔叔常说的：“一匹军马就是一门炮！”跃马扬鞭就冲出了大门。牧工们见“三英”姑娘去找军马，急得连声喊：“你们可不能去呀！这么大的雪，又有雾，掉进山沟里怎么办？！”“三英”姑娘坚定地回答：“我们人小也要听毛主席的话，困难我们不怕，救马要紧！”
      “三英”姑娘来到草滩，只见白茫茫的一片雪海。到哪里去找呢？她们想起了过去红军叔叔爬雪山、过草地的情景，顿时增添了力量。她们迎着刺骨的风雪来回奔跑，呼唤马儿。突然，在一个雪坡下发现了一匹马。她们飞奔过去拉住马，高兴得又跳又唱。“快马加鞭未下鞍”，“三英”姑娘继续战斗，她们不怕寒冷，不怕疲劳，转过一个山坡又一个山坡，经过七、八个小时的战斗，终于把七匹失散了的军马全找到了。
    紧张的战斗送走了白天，迎来了黑夜。“三英”姑娘赶着七匹军马，带着胜利的喜悦，往回走着。夜，渐渐深了，刺骨的寒风猛烈地向她们袭来。在草滩奔跑了一天，被汗水和雪水浸透了的棉衣，冻得象一块铁皮一样裹在身上。两只裤腿冻得梆硬，不能打弯。脚上的鞋袜和马镫冻在一起，马一跑，衣服上的冰疙瘩哗哗直响，就象给骏马挂上了一串铃铛。这时，拥树英想到两个伙伴，骑着马跑了一天，没吃没喝，关切地问道：“你们又冷又饿吧？”两个伙伴齐声回答：“饿点怕什么，雷锋叔叔不是说毛主席著作就是粮食吗！我们心中都有颗红太阳，天再冷也不怕。”于是，漫无边际的旷野响起了她们嘹亮的歌声：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    夜已经很深了。马队的领导、职工和家属们都为“三英”姑娘捏着一把汗，正准备分几路去找，忽然，有人喊了一声：“三英”姑娘回来啦！顿时，大人小孩都一齐涌了出来。“三英”姑娘被大家热情地接到屋里。在一片赞扬声中，“三英”姑娘谦逊地说：“是毛主席他老人家教我们这样做的。我们比起牧工叔叔来还差得远哩！我们一定要好好听毛主席的话，做他老人家的好孩子，做牧马工人的好后代。”
