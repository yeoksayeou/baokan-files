In the early days of the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "We must learn to engage in political, economic, and cultural struggles against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in the cities, and to engage in diplomatic struggles against imperialists. If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to struggle with these people, and do not achieve victory in these struggles, we will not be able to maintain our power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail." The history of the past decade has proven this to be true. Liu Shaoqi and his clique of capitalist roaders within the party used the power they had usurped to gather a group of traitors and spies, launching a frenzied attack on the proletariat in the ideological realm and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The struggle for the hearts and minds of the younger generation is a prominent aspect of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat. From many young soldiers who have just joined the army, we have seen the serious consequences of being poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. They always think that they are superior to workers and peasants, but in reality, their theory is detached from practice, and they lack a thorough revolutionary spirit. After joining the army, they have been nurtured under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, undergoing the tempering of revolutionary struggle, constantly transforming their worldview, and growing into heroes who fight against the heavens and the earth, becoming successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The growth of Seventh Platoon Leader Liu Bingwen is a case in point.

In 1964, when Liu Bingwen first joined the army, he thought that with his high school education, he should at least become an accountant or a technician in the army. However, when he arrived at the snowy plateau, the leadership gave him a shovel. During the material preparation and construction, while the old soldiers loaded a car with sand without lifting their heads or stretching their waists, he stared at the shovel, regretting that he had chosen the wrong path. He said, "Twelve years of schooling were wasted!" He also composed a rhyme: "Mountains above, deserts below, tens of miles without a soul, desolate and unworthy of observation."

The party branch saw in Liu Bingwen the harm caused by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line on the youth and decided to help him change. The branch decided that a comrade should guide him in studying the "Three Articles"; explain to him that hard struggle is glory, is victory, and is loyalty to Chairman Mao and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao; and inspire him to recall the hardships his father and uncle endured in the battle to defend Yan'an. Through repeated education, Liu Bingwen gradually realized that to build an iron wall against imperialism and revisionism, one must first build an iron wall against revisionism in one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought; to open the road to communism, one must first open the road of "publicness" in one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought. With his heightened awareness, he voluntarily transformed himself in the practical struggle. During construction, he braved the wind and snow, eagerly wielding large hammers and holding electric drills, always taking on the hardest and most laborious tasks. Each drop of sweat washed away the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in his mind; each callus on his hands strengthened his resistance to bourgeois ideological corruption. His thoughts and feelings gradually changed. Now his self-composed rhyme has become: "Shovels and pickaxes, revolutionary treasures, old comrades used them to build golden bridges, we will use them to bury the American and Soviet revisionists."

With proletarian thoughts and feelings in his mind, he can fight selflessly for the people's interests. In a firefighting battle, he led a platoon into a room engulfed in flames. Someone shouted, "The house is about to collapse!" He fearlessly said, "Even if the sky falls, we must save the people." He rushed into the fire several times, carrying out the people one by one, displaying the heroic spirit of a revolutionary soldier who fears no danger.

Comrade Liu Bingwen's profound change in thoughts and feelings made us deeply realize that "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." This transformation cannot be completed by sitting in tall buildings but must be completed in the three great revolutionary struggles. A young intellectual can only truly temper himself into pure steel and wholeheartedly serve the people of China and the world by not fearing hardships, daring to revolutionize himself, and tempering himself in harsh environments.

    在艰苦奋斗的革命实践中锻炼成长
    工程兵某部十连党支部
    早在党的七届二中全会上，毛主席就深刻地指出：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，并向帝国主义者作外交斗争。”“如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。”十多年来的历史，正是这样。刘少奇及其一伙党内的走资派，利用他们篡夺去的一部分领导权，搜罗了一批叛徒、特务，在思想领域中向无产阶级进行疯狂的进攻，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。争夺青年一代，就是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一个突出方面。我们从不少初入伍的知识青年战士身上，看到了反革命修正主义教育路线毒害的严重恶果。他们总以为自己比工农兵要“高”一头，其实是理论脱离实际，缺乏彻底的革命精神。到部队以后，他们在毛泽东思想的阳光哺育下，经过艰苦奋斗的革命实践的锻炼，不断改造自己的世界观，成长为战天斗地的好汉，无产阶级革命事业的接班人。七班长刘炳文的成长，就是一个例子。
    一九六四年，刘炳文刚入伍时，他想，凭着自己高中毕业的文化水平，到部队不当个会计，也得当个技术员。可是，到了风雪高原，领导上发给他一把铁锹。在备料施工中，老战士装一车沙，不抬头，不伸腰，他却望着铁锹发楞，后悔自己进错了门。说：“十二年书白念啦！”他还编了一首顺口溜：“上是山连山，下是黄草滩，数十里地无人烟，凄凉不可观。”
    党支部从刘炳文身上，看到了反革命修正主义教育路线对青年的毒害，决定帮助他转变过来。支部决定由一个同志辅导他学习“老三篇”；同他讲艰苦奋斗就是光荣，就是胜利，就是忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席革命路线的道理；启发他回忆他父亲和伯父在保卫延安战斗中所经历过的艰苦历程。通过反复教育，刘炳文渐渐认识到，要修筑反帝反修的钢铁长城，必须首先用毛泽东思想在头脑里筑起反修防修的钢铁长城；要开辟通向共产主义的大路，必须首先用毛泽东思想在头脑里开辟“公”字的大路。认识提高了，他就自觉地在实践斗争中改造自己。施工中，他风里来，雪里闯，抢着抡大锤，抱风钻，专找苦活累活干。颗颗汗珠，冲刷了他头脑里反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒；层层手茧，加强了他对资产阶级思想腐蚀的抵抗力。他的思想感情逐渐发生了变化。现在他自编的顺口溜变成了：“铁锹十字镐，革命传家宝，老战友用它架金桥，我们要用它把美帝苏修埋葬掉。”
    头脑里有了无产阶级的思想感情，就能够奋不顾身地为人民利益战斗。在一次救火的战斗中，他带领一个班冲进火焰封门的房子里。有人喊：“房子快塌了！”他毫不畏惧地说：“就是天塌了，也要把群众救出来。”他几次冲进火海，把群众一个一个背出来，表现了一个革命战士临危不惧的英雄气概。
    刘炳文同志思想感情的深刻变化，使我们深深地体会到，“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。这个转变，不是坐在高楼大厦里能够完成的，而是要在三大革命斗争中来完成的。一个知识青年，只有不怕艰苦，勇于自我革命，在艰苦环境里摔打锻炼，才能真正把自己炼成纯钢，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务。
