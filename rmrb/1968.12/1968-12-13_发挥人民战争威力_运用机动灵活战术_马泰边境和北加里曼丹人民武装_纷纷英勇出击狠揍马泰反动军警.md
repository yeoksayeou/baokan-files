People's armed forces on the Malaysia-Thailand border and in North Kalimantan have been bravely striking out, delivering heavy blows to the reactionary military and police of the "Malaysia" Lahman puppet clique and the Thai Thanom sellout clique.

	According to reports, people's armed forces active on the Malaysia-Thailand border launched three consecutive attacks from December 4 to 7 against the "Malaysia-Thailand Border Security Forces" that were conducting counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" operations against the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces employed flexible and mobile guerrilla tactics, eliminating a batch of reactionary military and police. According to reports from Singapore newspapers, on December 4, a patrol team of the "Malaysia-Thailand Border Security Forces" was conducting a "search" in the Wudong area when it suddenly came under heavy attack from people's armed forces well-hidden on a hill. Five members of the patrol team were injured on the spot. On December 7, the people's armed forces attacked another enemy patrol team, injuring four Thai and "Malaysian" reactionary policemen.

	According to reports from Sarawak newspapers, on November 18, the people's armed forces in North Kalimantan engaged in a 15-minute battle with "Malaysian" reactionary troops in the second district of Sarawak, inflicting losses on the enemy.
