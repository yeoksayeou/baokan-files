After work, I hurried back because tonight the production brigade was holding a criticism meeting at the school. The revolutionary committee assigned me to set up the venue. I thought to myself: There's only time for one meal before the meeting starts, so I must hurry to prepare.

As soon as I entered the school gate, I found that the venue had already been set up. A giant portrait of Chairman Mao hung in the center of the venue, radiating golden light; Mao's quotations were lined up on both sides, all red. The walls were covered with big-character posters: "Down with the big traitor, big spy, and big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!" "Never forget class struggle!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Who did this? I was puzzled. As I turned around, I saw a person in slightly worn clothes walking over. I immediately recognized him as Du Dezhi, the former principal of the original central school and now the head of the school revolutionary committee. His sleeves were rolled up, and his hands were covered in ink. I guessed that he must have set up the venue. So, I said in a grateful tone, "Principal Du! How come you..."

Before I could finish saying, "You are here to do what, and also help us do so much work?" he quickly interrupted, "This time I'm not here to 'inspect work.' This is my home now, so don't call me principal anymore. I'm here to be a student."

I really found it hard to believe that he, who had been the principal of the central school for eighteen years, would come to our remote little mountain village with only thirty-five households to be an elementary school teacher!

We talked as we walked into the house. On the kang (bed platform), there was an unopened backpack. Only then did I believe what he said was true. Seeing the backpack on the kang and the ink on Du's hands, I couldn't help but recall the "Principal Du" from four years ago. At that time, he came to our village school to inspect work, but it was completely different from now. He wore a new suit, carried a leather bag, and had a thermos on his shoulder. He walked with his chest out and his head held high. When people who knew him asked what he was doing in the village, he drawled, "I'm here to inspect work at your school." After he left, he left behind the nickname "inspect work" among the masses.

Just as I thought of this, Du, as if he had guessed my thoughts, said sadly, "Do you remember that four years ago I came to our village once? At that time, my behavior and mannerisms were simply not up to standard. Hey! This was mainly because I hadn't studied Mao Zedong Thought well and was poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi. I am also from a poor peasant family, but I had changed so much that I had lost all the flavor of a poor peasant. I became the principal of the central school, not a big official, but with a big attitude."

Saying this, he excitedly held up a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," looked at the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, and said with deep emotion, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this great proletarian cultural revolution to save me, I might have slipped into the quagmire of revisionism. Chairman Mao recently pointed out: 'In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants.' Now, public elementary schools are being transferred to the production brigades to manage, this is the bright path for teachers to achieve ideological revolutionization. I will settle down in this village, accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and work hard for the rest of my life!"

Later, I heard about Du's experience in coming to our village: On November 14, the suggestion by Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu about transferring public elementary schools to the production brigades to manage was published in the newspaper. The celebration meeting had just ended, and he immediately organized teachers to study and discuss overnight, and invited poor and lower-middle peasants to participate and listen to their opinions. At the meeting, he was the first to express: firmly walk out of the central school and settle down in the production brigade. After the higher authorities arranged it, the next morning, he packed his bag, took his red book, crossed mountains and valleys, and came to our most remote village in the entire commune. Du's change made me see the tremendous power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Truly: Chairman Mao's instructions spread across the four seas, the heavens change, the earth changes, and people change. As long as one masters Mao Zedong Thought, one can sweep away all the rotten bourgeois garbage and advance victoriously along the course indicated by Chairman Mao!

    俺们村来的新教员
    收工了，我急忙往回赶，因为今晚生产队要在小学校召开批判大会，革委会分配我布置会场。我心想：离开会时间只有一顿饭工夫了，得赶紧去准备。
    我刚走进学校大门，就发现会场早已布置好了。毛主席的巨幅画像悬挂在会场中央，金光四放；毛主席的语录牌林立两旁，一片通红。一条条大字标语贴满了院墙：“打倒大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇！”“千万不要忘记阶级斗争！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    这是谁干的呢？我正在纳闷。一转身，发现一个穿着半旧衣服的人走来，我一眼就看出了这是上苇甸原中心学校校长、现在的校革委会主任杜德志同志。他挽着袖子，双手沾满了墨水，我猜想这会场准是他布置的。于是我带着感谢的口气说：“杜校长！怎么您……”我还没说出“您是来办什么事情的，还帮助我们干了这么多事儿？”他就忙抢过话头说：“我这回可不是来‘检查工作’的。这儿就是我的家啦，往后再别叫我校长了，我是来当小学生的。”
    我真有点不相信，他当了十八年的中心学校校长，还能到我们这个仅有三十五户人家的偏僻小山村来当小学教师！
    我们俩一边说着，一边走进屋里，只见炕上放着一个还未打开的背包。这我才相信他说的是真的。看着炕上的背包和老杜手上的墨水，不禁使我回想起四年前的“杜校长”。那时他来我们村小学检查工作，可跟现在大不一样，穿着一身新料子服，手里提着皮包，肩上挎着水壶，走路挺胸仰脸；认识他的人问他来村有啥事儿，他拖着长音说：“来你们小学校检查工作。”他走了以后，在群众中就留下了一个“检查工作”的话把儿。
    我刚想到这儿，老杜同志象猜透了我的心事似的，沉痛地说：“记得我四年前来过咱村一次，那时候的作风举动简直不象个样子。嗨！这主要是我没有学好毛泽东思想，中了大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的毒，我也是个贫农出身，可变的简直没有一点贫农的味道，当了个中心学校校长，官不大吧，架子可不小。”他说到这里，激动地举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，望着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，无限深情地说：“要不是毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命挽救了我，我很可能滑到修正主义的泥坑里。毛主席最近指出：‘在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。’现在公办小学下放到大队来办，这是教师实现思想革命化的光明大道，我要在禅房安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育，踏踏实实地干它一辈子！”
    事后，我听说了老杜来咱们村的经过：十一月十四日侯振民、王庆余两同志关于公办小学下放到大队来办的建议在报纸上发表了，庆祝大会刚刚开过，他马上就组织教师连夜学习讨论，并邀请贫下中农参加，听取贫下中农的意见。在会上，他第一个表示：坚决走出中心学校，到生产大队去安家落户。经过上级安排，第二天一早，他就打起背包，带上红宝书，翻山越岭，来到了我们这个全公社最偏僻的山村。老杜的变化，使我看到了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。真是：毛主席指示四海传，天变地变人更变。一个人只要掌握了毛泽东思想，就能把腐朽的资产阶级货色一扫而光，沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进！
