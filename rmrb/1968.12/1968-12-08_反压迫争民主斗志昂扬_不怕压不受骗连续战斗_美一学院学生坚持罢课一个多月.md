Students at San Francisco State College in California, USA, have been fighting against racial discrimination and demanding reforms to the corrupt educational system for over a month. On the 6th, students foiled the reactionary administration's violent suppression and deceptive schemes, continuing their strike.

After failing to violently suppress the students' strike, the reactionary administration of San Francisco State College played tricks on the 6th, attempting to divide the students by partially accepting some of their minor demands to undermine their strike. However, the students at this college quickly saw through and exposed this scheme.

When the reactionary administration announced their plot over the radio, the over 3,500 black and white students gathered in the campus plaza immediately responded with boos and laughter to show their opposition. The students pointed out that the reactionary administration was merely playing tricks. They bravely raised their fists in front of 600 police officers, shouting slogans for the strike, and held a demonstration on campus, fully displaying their unyielding fighting spirit. Some residents from the nearby black community also participated in the demonstration.

The strike at San Francisco State College began on November 6th in response to the reactionary administration's unjust dismissal of a black lecturer. Facing the students' brave struggle, the college authorities were forced to suspend classes starting November 13th. The college president also resigned on November 26th. To extinguish the flames of the students' struggle, the reactionary administration began using hundreds of police officers to suppress the students starting December 2nd, arresting dozens of students. However, the students fearlessly continued their struggle.

    反压迫争民主斗志昂扬　不怕压不受骗连续战斗
    美一学院学生坚持罢课一个多月
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国加利福尼亚州州立旧金山学院的学生反对种族歧视，要求改革腐朽教育制度的斗争已坚持一个多月。六日学生粉碎了反动院方的暴力镇压和欺骗阴谋，坚持罢课斗争。
    州立旧金山学院的反动院方在连续使用暴力镇压学生的罢课斗争失败后，六日玩弄阴谋，企图用部分接受罢课学生的次要要求的办法，来分化学生，破坏学生的罢课斗争。但是这所学院的学生迅速识破并揭露了这一阴谋。
    在反动的院方通过广播向学生宣布他们的阴谋计划时，在院内广场上正在举行集会的三千五百多名黑人和白人学生立即用嘘声和讥笑来表示他们的反对，学生们指出，反动院方完全是在耍阴谋。他们还英勇地在六百名警察面前，举起拳头高呼着罢课的口号，在院内举行示威，充分显示了他们不达目的决不罢休的战斗精神。附近黑人区的部分居民也参加了这次示威。
    州立旧金山学院学生的罢课斗争，是十一月六日为了抗议反动的院方无理开除一名黑人讲师而引起的。在学生英勇斗争面前，学院当局于十一月十三日起被迫停课。学院院长也在十一月二十六日被迫辞职。为了扑灭学生斗争烈火，从十二月二日开始，反动的院方已连续五天使用数百名警察进行镇压，逮捕了几十名学生，但学生们不畏强暴，一直在坚持斗争。
