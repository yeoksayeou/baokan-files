The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaoshanxi Production Brigade in Minxian Commune, Suzhou County, Anhui Province, have been warmly assisting the sent-down youth, saying: We must arm them with Mao Zedong Thought.

The sent-down youth humbly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, striving to change their old thoughts in the three great revolutionary movements and have made significant progress.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 25 — Following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "Students from old schools are mostly or largely able to combine with workers and peasants, some of them even have inventions and creations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and be re-educated by workers and peasants to thoroughly change their old ideas," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaoshanxi Production Brigade in Minxian Commune, Suzhou County, Anhui Province, have been educating the sent-down youth in the brigade on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, helping them grow through the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside.

This autumn, more than twenty sent-down youth came to Xiaoshanxi Production Brigade to settle down. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, excitedly said, "The great leader Chairman Mao has entrusted the education of the sent-down youth to us, which is the greatest trust in us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must arm them with Mao Zedong Thought and cultivate them into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Soon after these sent-down youth arrived in Xiaoshanxi Production Brigade, the poor and lower-middle peasants discovered that some of them had thoughts of fearing hardship and "just taking a look," lacking the intention to settle down in the countryside for the long term. To address these immediate thoughts, the brigade set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, letting the poor and lower-middle peasants help the sent-down youth study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? How do we distinguish him? There is only one criterion, that is, whether he is willing to combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants or not, and whether he actually does so or not." In the study classes, the poor and lower-middle peasants also set high standards for themselves, seriously engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism. The revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants in daring to break with the bourgeois "self" deeply educated the sent-down youth, who also seriously engaged in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism. Many sent-down youth realized that the reason they had not established the idea of working in the countryside for life was that the poison of Liu Shaoqi's "theory of reading books to become officials" had not been thoroughly cleansed. They decided to take Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, and the old fool as shining examples, seriously accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and work in the countryside for a lifetime of revolution.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaoshanxi Production Brigade, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "class struggle, once grasped, is all-powerful," especially pay attention to educating the sent-down youth on family history and village history, extensively carrying out reminiscence and bitterness-sweetness activities, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants also put the sent-down youth on the front line of the struggle against the enemy, fighting against Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "self-reliance, self-management, self-sufficiency," and "four freedoms" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods, and fighting against the handful of class enemies in the brigade, enhancing the sent-down youth's hatred for the handful of class enemies. The sent-down youth said: In the past, when we talked about class struggle in school, it was just on the lips and on paper, unseen and untouchable. Now, by the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants, facing the enemy, on the battlefield, we raise our awareness and temper our red thoughts.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaoshanxi Production Brigade fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the sent-down youth, letting them grow through the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants organized the sent-down youth to form a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, creating and performing revolutionary cultural programs, and in their spare time going to water conservancy projects and various villages to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, this propaganda team, regardless of day or night, climbs mountains and crosses ridges to every village to propagate. Under the leadership of the brigade party organization, the sent-down youth set up two night schools, helping illiterate community members study Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and a series of latest instructions, teaching revolutionary songs. They also, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, extensively and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, strengthen supervision of class enemies, compile family history, village history, and the history of the two-line struggle in the brigade, and, in combination with local agricultural production, carry out scientific experimental activities.

These sent-down youth, under the help and education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, have been tempered in the three great revolutionary movements and have made significant progress. Among them, some have been rated as active promoters of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought; some have been called red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought; some have been elected as instructors of studying the works of Chairman Mao; some have become heroes in the struggle against the enemy and models of daring to take on heavy responsibilities. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "We welcome such sent-down youth."

    宿县小山西大队贫下中农热情帮助插队知识青年，他们说：
    一定要用毛泽东思想把他们武装起来
    插队知识青年虚心接受贫下中农的再教育，在三大革命运动中努力改变旧思想，有了很大进步
    新华社合肥二十五日电　安徽宿县闵贤公社小山西大队的贫下中农遵照伟大领袖毛主席“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”的教导，对在本队落户的知识青年进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，帮助他们在农村三大革命运动中锻炼成长。
    今年秋天，有二十多名知识青年到小山西大队插队落户。这个大队的贫下中农怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，激动地说，伟大领袖毛主席把知识青年交给我们来教育，这是对我们贫下中农的最大信任，我们一定要用毛泽东思想把他们武装起来，培养成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    这批知识青年来到小山西大队不久，贫下中农就发现一些人存在着怕艰苦和“看一看”的思想，缺乏在农村长期安家落户的打算。针对这些活思想，大队开办了毛泽东思想学习班，让贫下中农帮助知识青年学习“老三篇”和毛主席“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的教导。在学习班里，贫下中农还用高标准要求自己，认真进行斗私批修。贫下中农这种敢于和资产阶级“私”字决裂的革命精神深深教育了知识青年，他们也认真地进行了斗私批修。许多知识青年认识到，自己所以没有树立在农村干一辈子的思想，就是党内头号走资派刘少奇
  “读书做官论”的流毒还没有肃清，他们决心以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为光辉榜样，认真接受贫下中农的再教育，在农村干一辈子革命。
    小山西大队的贫下中农遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，特别注意对下乡知识青年进行家史和村史教育，广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，提高他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。广大贫下中农还把知识青年放到对敌斗争第一线，上批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货，下斗本大队的一小撮阶级敌人，增强知识青年对一小撮阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨。知识青年们说：过去在学校里讲阶级斗争，是挂在嘴上，写在纸上，看不见，摸不着。现在在贫下中农身旁，面对敌人，身临战场，提高觉悟，炼红思想。
    小山西大队的贫下中农充分发挥知识青年的积极性和创造性，放手让他们在农村三大革命运动中锻炼成长。贫下中农组织下乡知识青年成立了毛泽东思想宣传队，自编自演革命文艺节目，在业余时间到水利工地、各山村去宣传毛泽东思想。每当毛主席的最新指示一发表，这支宣传队就不论白天夜晚，爬山越岭到每个山村去宣传。在大队党组织的领导下，下乡知识青年开办了两个夜校，帮助不识字的社员学习毛主席的“老三篇”和一系列最新指示，教唱革命歌曲。他们还和贫下中农一起广泛深入地开展革命大批判，加强对阶级敌人的监督，编写家史、村史和大队两条路线斗争史，并且结合当地农业生产情况，开展科学实验活动。
    这批下乡知识青年在贫下中农的帮助教育下，在三大革命运动中经受了锻炼，都有了很大的进步。他们中有的被评为活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子；有的被称为毛泽东思想的红色宣传员；有的被推选为学习毛主席著作辅导员；有的成为对敌斗争的闯将和勇于挑重担的标兵。贫下中农高兴地说，这样的知识青年我们是欢迎的。
