	Educating children to go to the countryside, cadres must set an example
	Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, Wang Zhijie

	On the joyous occasion of fully implementing the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, and in the midst of the great momentum of the struggle, criticism, and reform, we have received the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao: "It is necessary for educated youth to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, or university to the countryside to form a movement. Rural comrades in all places should welcome them." Chairman Mao's words have the greatest power, and every sentence is the truth. I firmly support and will definitely carry out his instructions.

	Sending educated youth to settle down in the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is a great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao. It is an important way to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution and a long-term plan to prevent revisionism. This also gives a blow to the reactionary fallacies of "studying to become an official" advocated by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi. The attitude of parents towards their children going to the countryside is a major test of loyalty to Chairman Mao and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. All revolutionary cadres should take the lead and set an example in this work, firmly supporting their children in going to the mountains and countryside.

	My daughter Wang Chunyan is a high school graduate. Originally, she thought that after finishing high school, she would go to university. She was not mentally prepared to go to the countryside. She said things like, "Going to the countryside to settle down, all the years of study would be in vain!" "Even if I go, I will only stay for two or three years at most!" and so on.

	Seizing on this active thought, our whole family held a discussion meeting. At the meeting, we first severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "study to become an official" theory. Then, I talked to the child about the importance of going to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. I told the child: In the old society, how could the children of the poor go to school? Especially girls, it was completely impossible. Now, it is thanks to Chairman Mao that you have been able to finish high school. However, the great traitor Liu Shaoqi has implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, making you study hard, detached from class struggle, detached from the masses, detached from labor, and thinking day and night about fame and fortune. If you continue like this, you will become successors to revisionism. Think about it, how dangerous this road is! Our great leader Chairman Mao calls on intellectuals to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, to thoroughly change their old ideas, this is a bright path!

	After that family discussion meeting, my daughter's awareness was raised, and she began to prepare to go to the mountains and countryside. However, not long after, she had problems in her thoughts again. Originally, she was influenced by the idea of a few classmates who said, "Let's wait and see, don't go in the first batch!" I seized on her active thoughts again and mobilized the whole family to do thorough and detailed ideological work on her, encouraging her to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." Even her little sister encouraged her, saying, "Sister, you go first, and I will come in two years!"

	To enable her to go to the countryside as soon as possible to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, I went to the office for the placement of educated youth going to the mountains and countryside three times to help her make arrangements. After a few days of persuasion and education, she finally made up her mind to go to the countryside, get dirty, and temper her heart. Now, my eldest daughter has happily followed the first batch of educated youth going to the countryside and has been working and tempering herself for a whole month in a place praised by Chairman Mao 13 years ago in the preface to the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" - Yangheba.

	Revolutionary comrades! Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest concern for the broad masses of educated youth, and also the greatest concern for us broad revolutionary cadres. We must definitely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly persuade, mobilize, and support our children to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

    教育子女下农村，干部要起模范作用
    陕西省西乡县革委会副主任　王志杰
    在全面落实党的八届十二中全会公报的大喜日子里，在斗批改洪流进入高潮的大好形势下，又传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”毛主席的话威力最大，句句是真理。我坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    知识青年到农村安家落户，接受贫下中农再教育，是我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径，是反修防修的千年大计、万年大计。这也给了大叛徒刘少奇所宣扬的“读书做官”等反动谬论当头一棒。作父母的对待自己的子女到农村去抱什么态度，是忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个重大考验。一切革命干部，在这项工作中，都应该起模范带头作用，坚决支持自己的子女上山下乡。
    我女儿王春侠是高中毕业生。她原来的想法是上完中学上大学，对到农村去是没有思想准备的。她说什么“到农村去安家落户，上了几年学白上了！”“就是下去，顶多也不过呆个两三年！”等等。
    抓住她的这个活思想，我们全家开了个座谈会。在会上，我们首先狠批了刘少奇鼓吹的“读书做官论”。随后，我给孩子讲了去农村接受贫下中农再教育的重要性。我对孩子说：旧社会穷人的孩子哪能上学？尤其是女孩子，根本办不到。如今，你们托毛主席他老人家的福，才能念完了高中。但是，大叛徒刘少奇却推行了一条反革命修正主义教育路线，让你们死读书，脱离阶级斗争，脱离群众，脱离劳动，一天到晚想着成名成家。这样下去你们就会变成修正主义的接班人。想想看，这是多么危险的道路！我们的伟大领袖毛主席号召知识分子要接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，这是一条光明大道啊！
    经过那次家庭座谈会以后，我女儿的觉悟有了提高，开始准备上山下乡了。可是，过不多久，她的思想上又出了毛病。原来她受了少数同学“等等看”的思想影响，说什么“第一批不下去，等第二批吧！”我又抓住她的活思想，发动全家及时地给她作了深入细致的思想工作，动员她以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署前进。连她的小妹妹也鼓励她说：“姐姐，你先下去，过两年我就来了！”
    为了尽快地让她去农村，接受贫下中农的再教育，我曾三次去知识青年上山下乡安置办公室帮她联系。经过几天的说服教育，她终于立下了到农村去滚一身泥巴，炼一颗红心的决心。现在，我的大女儿已经愉快地跟随第一批下乡知识青年，在毛主席十三年前在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书按语中所表扬过的一个地方——杨河坝，劳动锻炼整整一个月了。
    革命的干部同志们！毛主席的最新指示，是对广大知识青年的最大关怀，也是对我们广大革命干部的最大关怀。我们一定要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，坚决说服、动员和支持自己的子女到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。
