Prince Souphanouvong Commends Lao Patriotic Military and Civilians
Achieving the Victory of Shooting Down and Destroying 900 U.S. Aircraft
Hongsa County Guerrillas in Savannakhet Province Kill Over 500 Enemies in One Year

KANGO, December 24 (Xinhua) According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, Chairman Souphanouvong of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee recently wrote a letter commending the Lao patriotic military and civilians for their glorious victory of shooting down and destroying 900 U.S. aggressor aircraft.

In his letter, Prince Souphanouvong pointed out that this great victory of the Lao patriotic military and civilians has exposed the so-called "U.S. air superiority" as a sham.

Prince Souphanouvong condemned the U.S. imperialists' frenzied intensification of their aggression against Laos. He called on the Lao patriotic military and civilians to press forward and achieve complete victory.

The report said that the Lao People's Liberation Army High Command also commended the above-mentioned victory achieved by the Lao patriotic military and civilians.

KANGO, December 24 (Xinhua) According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio Station, the guerrillas in Hongsa County, Savannakhet Province, have extensively carried out guerrilla warfare this year, bravely fighting the enemy with simple weapons and achieving significant results.

According to incomplete statistics, from January to late November this year, the Hongsa County guerrillas, in close cooperation with people of all ethnic groups, have killed a total of 565 enemies, including 323 killed in action. Among the killed enemies, there were two U.S. "advisors," four enemy battalion and company-level officers, and several soldiers from the Thai reactionary army.

The guerrillas also shot down six enemy aircraft with rifles and damaged three, seizing a large number of weapons and supplies.

The radio station said that while fighting the enemy, the guerrillas have also been working hard to build up their own strength. The guerrilla forces are growing stronger day by day, and the broad masses are increasing production, making the guerrilla areas more consolidated.
