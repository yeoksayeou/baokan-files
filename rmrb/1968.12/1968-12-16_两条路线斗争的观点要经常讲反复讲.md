The worker propaganda teams stationed in various colleges and universities in Tianjin have used Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee as a weapon to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi. They have educated the broad revolutionary teachers and students on the history of the struggle between the two lines, making the school's struggle, criticism, and reform deepen step by step.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The worker propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought stationed in various colleges and universities in Tianjin have used Chairman Mao's brilliant document, "Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," as the best weapon. They have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi, and educated the broad revolutionary teachers and students on the history of the struggle between the two lines. The class struggle and the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the revolutionary teachers and students have greatly increased. Many revolutionary teachers and students have deeply felt that studying the history of the struggle between the two lines has deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, enhanced their ability to distinguish right from wrong, friend from foe, true from false, and good from bad, and powerfully promoted the struggle, criticism, and reform.

Over the past three months, the worker propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought stationed in Tianjin colleges and universities, following the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin that "if one does not understand what class is, does not understand what exploitation is, one does not understand revolution," have first conducted education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines for the revolutionary teachers and students. They invited old workers who had deep bitterness and hatred in the old society to give reports on recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, organized students to visit the Three Stone Steps Class Education Exhibition Hall, led students to factories and countryside, and at the same time carried out a revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This has continuously raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary teachers and students, maintaining high political enthusiasm and revolutionary fighting spirit.

After the latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao that "historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be frequently and repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know" was issued, and Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee was reissued, the worker propaganda teams immediately conducted repeated learning and discussion with the broad revolutionary teachers and students. They recalled the history of the intense struggle between the two lines over the past few decades, especially the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and discussed the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great wisdom of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The worker propaganda teams in each school led the students to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the main content of studying the history of the Party's struggle between the two lines. Through learning, everyone deeply realized that in a class society, the most fundamental issue is the class struggle, the issue of which class holds political power. The line struggle within the Party is a reflection of the class struggle in society within the Party. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, not understanding the struggle between the two lines means not seeing the political situation clearly, not being able to judge right from wrong, distinguish friend from foe, and tell good from bad, not being able to unite true friends, and strike true enemies. In a word, not understanding revolution. Therefore, the struggle between the two lines must be emphasized every day, every month, every year, and in everything, to raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines high, to firmly establish the viewpoint of the struggle between the two lines, and to carry out the struggle between the two lines to the end.

As the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary teachers and students continues to increase, the school's struggle, criticism, and reform deepen step by step. Workers and revolutionary teachers and students have set up more large criticism columns, held various forms of criticism meetings, using Chairman Mao's important report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's series of latest directives as weapons. They have linked the actual struggle between the two lines in their units to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents' counter-revolutionary revisionist line, to investigate harm, eliminate poison, and expose the root causes, pushing everyone to think about Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to step onto Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to exert effort on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Currently, the revolutionary criticism in various colleges and universities in Tianjin is vigorous, and the work of cleaning up class ranks is deepening step by step, exposing a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionaries.

    两条路线斗争的观点要经常讲反复讲
    进驻天津各大专院校的工人宣传队，以毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，对广大革命师生进行两条路线斗争史的教育，使学校的斗、批、改步步深入
    新华社天津电　进驻天津各大专院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，以毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这篇光辉文献为最好武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，对广大革命师生进行两条路线斗争史的教育。广大革命师生阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，许多革命师生深有体会地说：学习了两条路线斗争史，加深了对毛主席革命路线的理解，增强了辨别是非、辨别敌我、辨别真假和辨别香臭的能力，有力地推动了斗、批、改。
    三个多月来，进驻天津大专院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，根据林副主席“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命”的教导，首先对革命师生进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育。他们请在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人作忆苦思甜报告，组织师生参观三条石阶级教育展览馆，带领师生下厂下乡，同时开展对刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判，使广大革命师生不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，保持饱满的政治热情和高昂的革命斗志。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示发表和毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告重新发表以后，工人宣传队立即同广大革命师生反复进行了学习和讨论。他们回忆了几十年来特别是两年多来无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线剧烈斗争的历史，畅谈了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和毛主席的革命路线的英明伟大。各学校的工人宣传队都领导师生们举办了以学习党的两条路线斗争史为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。大家通过学习深刻地认识到：在阶级社会里，最根本的问题是阶级斗争问题，是那个阶级掌握政权的问题。党内的路线斗争，是社会上阶级斗争在党内的反映。在无产阶级专政下不懂得两条路线斗争，就看不清政治形势，就不能判断是非，分清敌我，辨别香臭，就不能团结真正的朋友，打击真正的敌人。一句话，就不懂得革命。因此，两条路线斗争要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，事事讲，把两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，把两条路线斗争观点扎得牢牢的，把两条路线斗争进行到底。
    随着广大革命师生两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，学校的斗、批、改步步深入。工人和革命师生们办起了更多的大批判专栏，召开了各种形式的批判会，以毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的重要报告和毛主席一系列最新指示为武器，联系本单位两条路线斗争的实际，狠狠地批判刘少奇及其代理人的反革命修正主义路线，查危害，肃流毒，挖根源，推动大家心往毛主席革命路线上想，脚往毛主席革命路线上迈，劲往毛主席革命路线上使。目前，天津各大专院校的革命大批判轰轰烈烈，清理阶级队伍工作步步深入，揪出了一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和反革命分子。
