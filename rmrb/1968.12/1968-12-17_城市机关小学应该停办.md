Title: City Government Primary Schools Should Be Closed

City government primary schools should be closed. The reasons are as follows:

First, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental principle of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." City government-run primary schools are a manifestation of not connecting with the masses. Our government agencies are institutions that serve the people, and cadres are servants of the people. They should not have any special privileges.

Second, generally speaking, government-run primary schools have good facilities. Children there talk about food and clothing and show off their wealth. If such schools continue, they will instill in children a sense of superiority from a young age, becoming a breeding ground for revisionism.

Third, students in government-run primary schools are separated from the broad masses of workers from a young age and do not interact with the children of workers. This cultivates a bourgeois mentality of looking down on the working people.

After closing government-run primary schools, students can attend local schools.

    城市机关小学应该停办
    城市中某些机关办的小学，我认为应该停办。理由是：
    一、毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”城市机关办小学是不联系群众的一种表现。我们的机关是为人民办事的机构，干部是人民的勤务员，不能有任何特殊的地方。
    二、一般说，机关小学的设备好，孩子们在一块讲吃讲穿，摆阔气。这样的小学办下去，使小孩从小就养成高人一等的优越感，是产生修正主义的温床。
    三、机关小学的学生，从小就脱离广大工人群众，不与广大工人的孩子接触，从小就养成看不起劳动人民的资产阶级思想。
    机关小学停办后，学生可以就地上学。
