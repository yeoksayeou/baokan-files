Let the "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle" Go to Hell!

The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roadier Liu Shaoqi desperately promoted the black "six theories," which are a dirge for the restoration of capitalism. Especially the "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle," which is the most poisonous and harmful. Its evil purpose is to deny the dictatorship of the proletariat, to attempt to strangle the revolutionary nature of the Party, and to cause the proletarian revolutionary party to degenerate and change.

To erase class struggle and deny the dictatorship of the proletariat has always been the despicable trick of all big and small revisionists to castrate the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Liu Shaoqi is no exception. After the basic victory of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, he blathered about how "class struggle is basically over" and "the most important task of the state in the future is to organize social life." Where is the life-and-death class struggle? Where is the need for the dictatorship of the proletariat?

Has class struggle really "extinguished"? No! In socialist society, the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes still have considerable power for a fairly long period and are quite strong in some respects. They will never reconcile themselves to defeat and communism and will inevitably struggle tenaciously with the proletariat. In the political, economic, and cultural realms, they use various means to struggle with the proletariat, attempting to seize back the "paradise" they have lost. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, in order to save their failing fate, become even more frantic in their resistance to the proletariat. Therefore, class struggle becomes even more acute, more complex, and more intense.

Before the liberation of the whole country, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The state power of the People's Republic led by the working class, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, is not to be weakened but must be strengthened." The dictatorship of the proletariat is a tool used by the proletariat to suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes and is a weapon for the proletariat to completely defeat the bourgeoisie. In socialist society, the central issue of class struggle is still the issue of power. Since liberation, the most concentrated manifestation of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes attacking the proletariat is that Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices have set up a bourgeois headquarters within the proletarian state power, resisting, distorting, and sabotaging the line, principles, and policies proposed by Chairman Mao regarding the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle" is precisely their smoke screen for their evil activities of subverting the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. If Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' plot to usurp the Party, usurp state power, and usurp the military is successful, the Party will become revisionist, the country will change color, and the heads of tens of millions of people will roll. We must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and strengthen our awareness of class struggle, constantly strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has purged Liu Shaoqi, this faithful running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and also the most powerful and profound criticism of the "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle"!

Let Liu Shaoqi and his "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle" go to hell!

    让“阶级斗争熄灭论”见鬼去吧！

    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇拚命鼓吹的黑“六论”，是一支复辟资本主义的招魂曲。特别是“阶级斗争熄灭论”，更是毒中之毒，害中之害。其罪恶目的，就是为了否定无产阶级专政，妄想扼杀党的无产阶级革命性，使无产阶级革命党蜕化变质。
    抹煞阶级斗争，否定无产阶级专政，历来就是一切大大小小的修正主义者阉割马克思列宁主义的革命精神的卑鄙伎俩。刘少奇也不例外。在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造取得基本胜利后，他胡说什么“阶级斗争基本结束”，“今后国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”。这哪里还有你死我活的阶级大搏斗？哪里还需要无产阶级专政？
    阶级斗争真的“熄灭”了吗？不！在社会主义社会里，资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，在相当长的时期内还是有力量的，并且在某些方面还相当强大。他们决不甘心于亡国、共产，必然要顽强地同无产阶级继续较量。他们在政治、经济、文化各个领域，采用各种手段，同无产阶级进行斗争，妄想夺回失去的“天堂”。在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，资产阶级和其他剥削阶级为了挽救他们失败的命运，对无产阶级的反抗更为疯狂。因而，阶级斗争就变得更为尖锐、更为复杂、更为激烈。
    毛主席在全国解放前夕指出：“工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化。”无产阶级专政，是无产阶级用来镇压资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的反抗的工具，是无产阶级彻底战胜资产阶级的武器。在社会主义社会里，阶级斗争的中心问题仍然是政权问题。解放以来，资产阶级和一切剥削阶级向无产阶级进攻的最集中表现，就是刘少奇及其同伙在无产阶级政权内部拼凑一个资产阶级司令部，抵制、歪曲、破坏毛主席提出的关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的路线、方针、政策。而“阶级斗争熄灭论”正是他们大搞颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义罪恶活动的烟幕弹。如果让刘少奇及其同伙篡党、篡政、篡军的阴谋得逞，党会变修，国要变色，千百万人头就要落地。我们一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把阶级斗争观念搞得浓浓的，不断强化无产阶级专政。
    无产阶级文化大革命清除了刘少奇这个帝国主义、现代修正主义、国民党反动派的忠实走狗。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命学说的伟大胜利，也是对“阶级斗争熄灭论”的最有力、最深刻的批判！
    让刘少奇和他的“阶级斗争熄灭论”一起见鬼去吧！
