	Down with American Imperialism! Down with the Military Dictatorship!
	Bolivian Peasants Rise Up to Fight Against the Reactionary Tax Law
	The peasants' just struggle gains increasing support from workers and students

	Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: La Paz—Recent reports indicate that Bolivian peasants have risen up in struggle, shouting slogans to overthrow American imperialism and the military dictatorship, opposing a new exploitative measure imposed by the pro-American military dictatorship of Barrientos—a "unified agricultural tax."

	According to reports, peasants in La Paz, Santa Cruz, Beni, Oruro, Sucre, and Tarija have firmly declared their opposition to the reactionary tax law recently enacted by the military dictatorship. In many regions, peasants have held protest meetings and demonstrations to condemn this tax law.

	In Achacachi, outraged peasants took action on the 15th and 16th to resist oppression and exploitation, forming a powerful movement against American imperialism and military dictatorship. Local peasants turned a meeting convened by the authorities to pressure peasants into paying taxes into a protest meeting. Nearly ten thousand peasants participating in the meeting shouted slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism!" and "Down with the Military Dictatorship!" They attacked the municipal government and the police station. The peasants' struggle received support from local miners and students.

	In some areas of Santa Cruz Province, peasants held demonstrations against the new tax law. The reactionary authorities, in an attempt to suppress the peasant struggle, unjustly arrested demonstrators. Angry peasants detained a reactionary officer and another reactionary, seizing the jeep the reactionary officer was riding in.

	On the 18th, when the head of the pro-American military dictatorship, Barrientos, attempted to justify the reactionary tax law in a speech in Beren, La Paz Province, three thousand local peasants drove him away with jeers and stones. The peasants also shouted slogans such as "Down with the unified tax!"

	Broad masses of Bolivian peasants have pointed out that the purpose of this reactionary tax law is to maintain feudal and capitalist exploitation, while transferring the current economic crisis faced by the military dictatorship onto the peasants, making them even more impoverished.

	Many peasants have also exposed the conspiracy of the Barrientos dictatorship in convening a so-called "National Peasant Congress" to forcibly pass this tax law. Some peasant representatives withdrew from the meeting in protest, opposing the pro-American military dictatorship's coercion to accept this reactionary tax law.

	Currently, the struggle of the broad masses of Bolivian peasants against the unified agricultural tax is gaining increasing support from workers and students. A mass struggle centered on opposing the unified agricultural tax, resisting oppression and exploitation, and opposing the pro-American dictatorship is developing across the country.

    打倒美帝国主义　打倒军事独裁政权
    玻利维亚农民奋起斗争反对反动税收法
    农民的正义斗争得到越来越多的工人和学生的支持
    新华社二十九日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚广大农民最近高呼打倒美帝和军事独裁政权的口号，奋起斗争，反对巴里恩托斯亲美军事独裁政权强加在农民头上的一项新的剥削措施——“农牧业统一税”。
    据报道，玻利维亚的拉巴斯、圣克鲁斯、贝尼、奥鲁罗、苏克雷和塔里哈等地的农民断然宣布反对军事独裁政权最近制订的反动税收法。许多地区的农民还举行了谴责这项税收法的抗议集会和游行示威。
    在阿恰卡奇，激愤的农民在十五日和十六日纷纷起来采取反压迫、反剥削的斗争行动，形成了强烈的反对美帝国主义和军事独裁统治的群众运动。当地农民把当局为压服农民缴纳捐税而召开的大会，变成了抗议大会，近万名参加大会的农民高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“打倒军事独裁政权”等口号，袭击了市政府和警察局。农民的斗争得到了当地矿工和学生的支持。
    圣克鲁斯省一些地区的农民曾经举行了抗议新税收法的示威。反动当局为了镇压农民斗争，无理逮捕示威群众。愤怒的农民扣押了一名反动军官和另一名反动分子，还缴获了那个反动军官乘坐的吉普车。
    十八日，当亲美军事独裁政权的头子巴里恩托斯在拉巴斯省的贝伦发表演说，企图为反动的税收法辩解时，当地的三千名农民当场用嘘声和石块轰走了这个独裁者。农民们还高呼“打倒统一税”等口号。
    玻利维亚广大农民指出，这个反动税收法的目的是为了维护封建的和资本主义的剥削，同时把军事独裁政权目前面临的经济危机转嫁到农民身上，使农民更加贫困。
    许多农民还揭露了巴里恩托斯独裁政权召开所谓的“全国农民代表大会”强行通过这一税收法的阴谋。一些农民代表曾经当场退出这个会议，抗议亲美军事独裁政权强迫他们接受这个反动的税收法。
    目前，玻利维亚广大农民反对农牧业统一税的斗争，正得到越来越多的工人和学生的支持。一个以反对农牧业统一税为中心的反压迫、反剥削和反对亲美独裁统治的群众性斗争正在全国发展。
