With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the nation have been continuously holding various celebratory activities. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, more and more young intellectuals are enthusiastically signing up to go to the front lines of agricultural production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants warmly welcome the young intellectuals to settle down in the countryside.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "It is very necessary for young intellectuals to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must persuade urban cadres and others to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, and college to the countryside for re-education. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction is now becoming the conscious action of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Many regions have dispatched large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the grassroots to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many regions have held classes for young intellectuals, urban residents, and revolutionary parents to study Mao Zedong Thought, seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many revolutionary cadres and old workers have held family heart-to-heart talks, educating their children to never forget class bitterness, to remember blood debts, and to resolutely take the brilliant path indicated by Chairman Mao to go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The People's Liberation Army units have even more extensively carried out the activity of writing red letters, writing letters to encourage their relatives and classmates in the cities to settle down in the countryside, and mobilizing their relatives in the countryside to warmly receive the young intellectuals and urban residents who come to settle down.

The joyous news of Chairman Mao's latest instructions has reached the broad masses of young intellectuals who have already settled down in the countryside, who are overjoyed and extremely excited, repeatedly shouting: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They say, our path is correct! We came to the countryside not to "plate gold" but to take root. We will forever follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, walking to the end! Many young intellectuals who have already settled down in the countryside for many years and have made contributions to building socialist new villages have enthusiastically discussed their gains and experiences from reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and receiving re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. A standing committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of Baodi County, Hebei Province, Hou Jun, said, Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will amount to nothing." Since I graduated from high school and came to the countryside more than six years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings have always guided me forward. The poor and lower-middle peasants' clear class feelings, hardworking and simple good style, and selfless dedication to the revolution have given me profound education. In the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, I gradually overcame the bad influences of the old school, continuously raising my awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Although I am far from Beijing, my heart is closer to Chairman Mao. I deeply feel that the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao, the path of combining with workers and peasants, is the necessary path for the revolutionization of young intellectuals.

Young intellectuals from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other large cities who have settled down in the countryside of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Shanxi, and other places, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, used their personal experiences to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, enthusiastically praising the proletarian revolutionary line of the great leader Chairman Mao. A young intellectual who settled down in Hongta Commune, Tonghe County, Heilongjiang, said: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our lifeline. The countryside is our great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants are our good teachers. To make a revolution, to become a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, we must forever listen to Chairman Mao's words and firmly combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants! A young intellectual who went from Beijing to settle down in Baiyinbaolige Commune, Abag Banner, Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia, said: Although we have only been in Inner Mongolia for four months, under the education of the poor herdsmen, we have more deeply understood what class is, what exploitation is, and what revolution is. We will forever follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, taking root and blooming on the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia.

In the past two days, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Tianjin, Jilin, Zhejiang, and many other regions have sent another batch of young intellectuals, holding precious books and carrying luggage, rushing to the countryside and the border areas. Even more young intellectuals are writing applications and expressing their determination to go to the front lines of agricultural production. In the past two days, nearly a thousand young intellectuals in Hangzhou have enthusiastically rushed to Heilongjiang and the countryside of their province. They said proudly: The great leader Chairman Mao points the way, and we will not lose our way in the turbulent waves. We will walk the path of combining with workers and peasants for life, tempering and growing in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside. A batch of middle school graduates who are going from Lanzhou to settle down in the countryside of Hexi Corridor are listening to Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the train, immediately holding a sharing meeting in the car, expressing their determination in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and offering their red hearts: to honestly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly transform their worldview, and become a faithful successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause for life. Many students of Lhasa Middle School in Tibet have expressed their desire to quickly settle down in the vast countryside and pastoral areas. They said: We, the children of liberated serfs, listen most to Chairman Mao's words. To go to the countryside, to the pastoral areas, to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, this is our common wish.

The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "The countryside is a vast world, where one can achieve great things." Various levels of cadres have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further recognizing that educating their children to walk the path indicated by Chairman Mao of combining with workers and peasants is a major task of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a major task of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have held family Mao Zedong Thought study classes and family meetings, mobilizing their children to go to the countryside. In the past two days, many cadres have happily taken their children to school to sign up to go to the mountains and countryside, and some cadres have packed their children's luggage overnight.

Various levels of revolutionary committees and workers and soldiers Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in colleges and universities have taken various measures to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many regions' revolutionary committees have established leading groups to mobilize and organize young intellectuals to go to the mountains and countryside. The Revolutionary Committee of Hejin County, Shanxi Province, required all levels of revolutionary committees in the county to take immediate action, organizing Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into cities and countryside, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household and every person; requiring rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to actively do a good job of welcoming and settling the young intellectuals who come down to the countryside. The Revolutionary Committee of Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, on the night of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, immediately contacted relevant departments in Xi'an City and decided to advance the welcoming of 1,500 middle school graduates to settle down in the county. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in Anhua Middle School, Changning District, Shanghai, held study classes in the entire school by class, squad, and platoon, combining the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, deeply studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, greatly raising the awareness of the entire school's young intellectuals to consciously respond to Chairman Mao's great call, going to the countryside to settle down.

In the past few days, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants across the nation have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "welcome them" and are actively preparing to warmly welcome and settle the young intellectuals and urban residents who go to the mountains and countryside. Many poor and lower-middle peasants, looking at Chairman Mao's portrait, said excitedly, the great leader Chairman Mao trusts us so much, entrusting us with the great task of educating young intellectuals, we poor and lower-middle peasants must strive for Chairman Mao's sake, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the younger generation well! A poor peasant in Heixing Brigade, Jiancang Commune, Linkou County, Heilongjiang Province, in order to welcome the young intellectuals who come down to the countryside, left his newly built house, which he had prepared for his marriage, for the new commune members to live in. In addition to doing a good job of all living preparations for the young intellectuals and urban residents who come to settle down here, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shuangfa Commune, Zhaozhou County, also prepared to let them have their first meal as a bitter meal, their first meeting as a bitter meeting, and their first class as a Mao Zedong Thought class after they enter the village. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hanzhuang Brigade, Qinong Commune, Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, organized old poor peasants and active elements in studying Mao Zedong Thought to form one-to-one and red pairs with the young intellectuals who came down to the countryside. Recently, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade also submitted a report, requesting to allocate more young intellectuals to them. The poor and lower-middle peasants and old Red Army soldiers in the Jinggangshan area of Jiangxi Province prepared the revolutionary traditional meal of "red rice and pumpkin soup" for the young intellectuals who came to settle down here. The old Red Army soldiers told them the revolutionary struggle history of Jinggangshan. The young intellectuals were extremely excited and said, we must carry on the revolutionary banner, learn from the example of the poor and lower-middle peasants, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, walk the path of combining with workers and peasants, and do revolution for life in Jinggangshan!

    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”毛主席的这一光辉指示，正在化为亿万革命群众的自觉行动。许多地区出动了大批毛泽东思想宣传队，深入基层宣传毛主席的最新指示。不少地区举办了知识青年、街道居民、革命家长的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示。许多革命干部和老工人，召开家庭谈心会，教育子女不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，坚决走毛主席指引的到农村去接受贫下中农再教育的光辉道路。人民解放军各部队更加广泛地开展了写红色书信活动，纷纷写信鼓励自己在城市的亲人和同学到农村安家落户，动员在农村的亲属热情接待前来落户的知识青年和城镇居民。
    毛主席最新指示发表的喜讯传来，已在乡下安家落户的广大知识青年，兴高采烈，无比激动，一遍又一遍地高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们说，我们的路走对了！我们到农村，不是来“镀金”的，而是来扎根的。我们要永远走毛主席指引的路，一走到底！许多已经在农村安家落户多年，在建设社会主义新农村中作出了贡献的知识青年，纷纷畅谈他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，接受贫下中农再教育的收获和体会。河北宝坻县革委会常委侯隽说，毛主席早就教导我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”我高中毕业后到农村六年多来，伟大领袖毛主席的教导一直指引着我前进。贫下中农爱憎分明的阶级感情，勤劳朴实的优良作风，全心全意为革命的高尚品德，给了我深刻的教育。在农村三大革命运动中，我逐渐克服旧学校给我的坏影响，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。我虽然人离北京远了，可是心却离毛主席更近了。我深深体会到，毛主席指引的与工农相结合的光明大道，是知识青年革命化的必由之路。
    到黑龙江、内蒙古、新疆、山西等地农村安家落户的北京、上海、天津、武汉等大城市和其他地方的知识青年，在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，用自己的亲身体会，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。到黑龙江通河县红太公社红太大队落户的知识青年说：毛主席的革命路线是我们的生命线，农村是我们活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，贫下中农是我们的好老师。要革命，要做无产阶级革命事业接班人，就必须永远听毛主席的话，坚决同贫下中农结合在一块！从北京到内蒙古锡林郭勒盟阿巴哈纳尔旗白音宝力格公社落户的知识青年说：我们到内蒙古虽然只有四个月，但是在贫苦牧民的教育下，我们更深刻地懂得了什么是阶级，什么是剥削，什么是革命。我们要永远走毛主席指引的路，在内蒙古大草原上生根、开花。

    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”各地广大干部认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，进一步认识到，教育自己的子女走毛主席指引的同工农相结合的道路，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大事，是贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的大事。他们纷纷举办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，召开家庭会，动员子女到农村去。这两天，有不少干部高高兴兴地带着自己的子女去学校报名上山下乡，有的干部连夜给子女整理行装。
   各级革命委员会和各地进驻大中学校领导斗、批、改的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，采取各种措施，认真落实毛主席的最新指示。许多地区的革委会成立了动员和组织知识青年上山下乡的领导小组。山西河津县革委会，要求全县各级革委会迅速行动起来，组织毛泽东思想宣传队，深入城乡，使毛主席这一最新指示家喻户晓，人人皆知；要求农村干部和贫下中农积极做好欢迎、安置下乡知识青年的工作。陕西富平县革委会在学习毛主席最新指示的当晚，就与西安市有关部门联系，决定提前迎接一千五百名中学毕业生到本县安家落户。驻上海长宁区安化中学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在全校按班、排、连举办了学习班，结合两条路线斗争史的学习，深入学习毛主席的最新指示，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货，大大提高了全校知识青年坚决响应毛主席伟大号召，到农村去安家落户的自觉性。
    连日来，全国各地广大贫下中农热烈响应毛主席关于“各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去”的号召，正在积极准备热情迎接和安置上山下乡知识青年和城镇居民。许多贫下中农望着毛主席的画像，激动地说，伟大领袖毛主席这样信任我们，把教育知识青年的大事交给我们办，我们贫下中农一定要为毛主席争气，用毛泽东思想教育好青年一代！黑龙江林口县建堂公社合兴大队的一位贫农社员，为了迎接下乡的知识青年，把自己准备结婚用的新房留给新社员住。肇州县双发公社广大贫下中农除了为来这里安家落户的知识青年和城镇居民做好一切生活准备工作外，还准备让他们进村后，吃的第一顿饭是忆苦饭，开的第一次会是忆苦会，上的第一堂课是毛泽东思想课。江苏淮安县钦工公社韩庄大队组织老贫农和学习毛泽东思想积极分子与下乡的知识青年结成一帮一、一对红的对子。这个大队的贫下中农最近又打了报告，要求多分配一些知识青年给他们。江西井冈山地区的贫下中农和老红军战士，为到这里安家落户的知识青年做了井冈山的革命传统饭“红米饭南瓜汤”。老红军战士给他们讲述了井冈山的革命斗争史。知识青年们无比激动地说，我们一定要接过革命的红旗，学习贫下中农的榜样，沿着毛主席指引的方向，走与工农相结合的道路，在井冈山干一辈子革命！
