	Warmly Welcome Intellectual Youth to the Countryside

	Chairman Mao recently instructed us, "Intellectual youth should go to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is very necessary. We must persuade cadres and other people in the cities to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, or college to the countryside to accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them." Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a large number of intellectual youth enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to the countryside to settle down, and receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a great revolution, and it is necessary to do painstaking and meticulous political and ideological work.

	Some people say, "We young people going to the countryside, we ourselves don't have much of a problem, but our families have a hard time accepting it." Some parents love their children and are afraid that they will not be able to adapt to life in the countryside, that they will suffer from hard labor, that they will be far from home, and so on. This raises the question of what kind of love parents should have for their children? Should we keep them in a greenhouse, making them weak and ignorant, turning them into sprouts of revisionism? Or should we let them go to the vast countryside, live by their own labor, undergo hard training, receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and become successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat? We believe that the former approach is not true love for one's children, but harm to them; the latter approach is true love. Because we raise our children not to support us in old age, but to prevent revisionism. It is not enough for just our generation to not degenerate; we must ensure that every generation does not degenerate, so that our socialist state will never change color. Cadres and other people in the cities must listen to Chairman Mao's words, send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, or college to the countryside to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and ensure that their children walk the path of revolutionization, while parents do not block the way.

	Some people say, "It's good for intellectual youth to go to the countryside, but it's a waste of talent." This way of thinking is incorrect. People with culture should use their culture in practice. If they do not use it in practice, culture is of no use. Some people have read many books, but when they go to the countryside, they cannot even tell the difference between leeks and wheat seedlings. Although they eat white flour every day in the city, they do not know where white flour comes from. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Intellectuals must go among the workers and peasants, and only then can they accomplish anything." This is an absolute truth. Therefore, intellectual youth must happily go to the countryside, go among the masses, use your culture in the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, take over the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, and build a new socialist countryside with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Some people say, "Life in the countryside is hard, and I can't stand it." Is life in the countryside really hard? What is hard and what is sweet? Different classes and different standpoints have different views. We think that in the old society, the poor and lower-middle peasants had no status, were oppressed by landlords and rich peasants, and lived a life worse than cattle. That was truly hard. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to rise up, live a happy life, work for the revolution, and farm for the revolution, which is the most glorious, happiest, and most enjoyable thing. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai suffered greatly in the old society; now, no matter how hard the labor is, we feel sweet, because the poor and lower-middle peasants have not forgotten the past hardships. We are not afraid of hardships; Dazhai has been tempered and grown in the process of fighting against nature, fighting against the land, and fighting against class enemies. We hope that young people will remember Chairman Mao's teachings, establish the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance in building a new China. With this spirit, going to the mountains and countryside, going to hard places, will not be felt as hard.

	Intellectual youth going to the countryside to settle down, first of all, must settle down in heart, settling down without settling down in heart is not good, settling down without settling down in thought is also not good. How to settle down in heart and settle down in thought? In a thousand ways and a million ways, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, realizing the revolutionization of one's thought, is the first way. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call, warmly welcome intellectual youth to take root in the countryside, and work together with us poor and lower-middle peasants to do a lifetime of revolution in the countryside, and contribute our strength to the construction of socialism.

### 热烈欢迎知识青年到农村来

    热烈欢迎知识青年到农村来
    山西昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队全体贫下中农
    毛主席最近教导我们说：“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去。”在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，广大知识青年热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农村安家落户，接受贫下中农的再教育。这是一场大革命，需要耐心细致地做好政治思想工作。
    有的人说：“我们青年人到农村去，本人问题不大，家庭关怪难过的。”有的父母疼爱自己的子女，怕到农村生活过不惯呀，劳动受累呀，离家远呀，等等。这就提出一个问题，做父母的对自己的子女要有什么样的爱？是让他们关在温室里，养成四体不勤，五谷不分，变成修正主义的苗苗呢？还是让他们到广阔的农村来，靠双手劳动生活，进行艰苦锻炼，接受贫下中农的再教育，成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人？我们认为，前一种做法，对子女不是真正的爱，而是害了子女；后一种做法，对子女才是真正的爱。因为我们养儿不是为了防老，而是为了防修，搞革命光我们这一辈不变质还不行，要保证代代不变质，才能保证我们的社会主义江山永不变色。城里的干部和其他人，都要听毛主席的话，把自己的初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，接受贫下中农的再教育，做到子女走革命化的道路，父母不拦路。
    也有的人说：“知识青年到农村去好是好，就是有点屈才。”这种思想是不正确的。有文化的人应该把文化用到实践中去，如果不用到实践中去，有了文化也没有用处。有的人读了好多书，到农村连韭菜和麦苗都分不清，虽然在城市里天天吃白面，却不知白面是咋来的。毛主席教导说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”这是千真万确的真理。因此，知识青年一定要高高兴兴地到农村来，到群众中来，把你的文化用在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命实践中去，接好无产阶级革命事业的班，和贫下中农一起建设社会主义的新农村。
    还有的人说：“农村里生活苦，下去受不了。”农村的生活到底苦不苦呢？什么是苦，什么是甜？不同阶级、不同立场，有着不同的看法。我们觉得旧社会贫下中农没地位，受地主、富农压迫，过着牛马不如的生活，那才是苦。共产党、毛主席领导我们翻了身，过上了幸福的生活，为革命劳动，为革命种田，是最光荣、最幸福、最愉快的事。大寨贫下中农在旧社会受尽了人吃人的苦；现在劳动不论怎样辛苦也觉得甜，因为贫下中农没有忘记过去的苦。我们是不怕苦的，大寨就是在和天斗、和地斗、和阶级敌人斗的过程中锻炼成长起来的。我们希望青年人要牢记毛主席的教导，树立艰苦奋斗建设新中国的革命志气，有了这种志气，上山下乡，到艰苦的地方去，就不会觉得苦了。
    知识青年到农村安家落户，首先要把心安下来，安家不安心是不行的，落户不落实思想也是不行的。怎样做到安心、落实思想呢？千条万条，靠毛泽东思想，实现人的思想革命化，是第一条。我们贫下中农坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，热烈欢迎知识青年来农村扎根，和我们贫下中农一起，在农村干一辈子革命，为建设社会主义贡献自己的力量。
