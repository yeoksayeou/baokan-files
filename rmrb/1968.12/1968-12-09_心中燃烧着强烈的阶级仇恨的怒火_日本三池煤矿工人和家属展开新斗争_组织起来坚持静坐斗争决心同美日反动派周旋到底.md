More than a hundred workers and family members of the Miike coal mine in Kyushu, Japan, have recently launched a new struggle against the brutal exploitation and oppression by the Japanese Mitsui monopoly capital, which is colluding with U.S. imperialism.

Miike is one of Japan's largest coal mines. Due to the ruthless exploitation of workers by Japanese monopoly capital, which treats workers as less than human, there have been numerous serious mining accidents since World War II, resulting in the deaths and injuries of many workers. Five years ago, a massive explosion occurred at Miike coal mine, killing 458 miners and leaving nearly 800 miners disabled or semi-disabled.

Miike coal mine workers, in their struggle against the barbaric rule of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the ruthless exploitation of Japanese monopoly capital, have never stopped fighting for their right to live. As early as 1960, when the Japanese people were engaged in a great struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Miike coal mine workers, despite the fascist suppression by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, carried out the world-shaking Miike coal mine struggle, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

According to the revelations of Miike coal mine workers, U.S. imperialism, in order to push its policy of aggression and war in Asia, has in recent years intensified its collusion with the Mitsui monopoly group, using the coal from Miike coal mine as raw material to produce large quantities of poison gas used to massacre the Vietnamese people in the Vietnam War.

Recently, the Mitsui monopoly group has further intensified its exploitation and oppression of Miike coal mine workers.

Not long ago, the Mitsui monopoly group proposed the so-called "Fourth Rationalization Plan" for Miike coal mine, attempting to further increase the intensity of workers' labor and force underground workers to work in even more dangerous conditions to maximize profits.

Under the heavy exploitation of the capitalists, Miike coal mine workers lead extremely miserable lives. Some workers, with over twenty years of service, still receive pitifully low wages. Many miners, unable to support their families, have to send their family members to work as laborers, suffering even more brutal exploitation by the capitalists. The lives of family members who have lost loved ones in the mine explosion are even more desperate and hopeless.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The workers and family members of Miike coal mine are burning with intense class hatred. Recently, more than a hundred workers and family members who have lost loved ones in past mining accidents have organized and, starting from November 9, have been staging a sit-in protest in front of the north gate of the Mikawa mine of Miike coal mine. They are opposing the Mitsui monopoly group's so-called "Fourth Rationalization Plan" and the further brutal exploitation of workers by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

Many workers have expressed their determination to oppose U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war and to overthrow the reactionary Sato government. They have built a "struggle hut" and a lookout tower near the protest site using wooden materials and have hoisted red flags around the area. Each protester has a handkerchief with slogans tied around their head, taking turns to sit in protest day and night. They have been persistent in their struggle for nearly a month.

The monopoly capital group is terrified of the workers' and their families' struggle, keeping the north gate of the Mikawa mine tightly shut, banning people and vehicles from entering and exiting, and dispatching thugs and plainclothes agents to guard the gate and monitor the workers' actions.

The workers persist in their struggle and study Chairman Mao's works in the process. Some workers organized a study group for "Quotations from Chairman Mao" a year and a half ago and have continued to this day. Participants in this study group say: Japanese workers must completely break with parliamentarism, economism, and legalism, and thoroughly cleanse the extremely harmful influence that the revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda of the Japanese Communist Party has had on the Japanese workers' movement for a long time. They say: Only by using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to carry out the revolution can we defeat the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

    心中燃烧着强烈的阶级仇恨的怒火
    日本三池煤矿工人和家属展开新斗争
    组织起来坚持静坐斗争决心同美日反动派周旋到底
    据新华社六日讯　东京消息：日本九州三池煤矿的一百多名工人和工人家属，为了反对与美帝相勾结的日本三井大垄断资本的残酷压榨和剥削，最近展开了新的斗争。
    三池煤矿是日本的最大煤矿之一。由于日本垄断资本残酷地压榨工人，不把工人当人看待，第二次世界大战以来，这里多次发生过严重的矿内事故，使大批工人惨遭伤亡。五年前，三池煤矿发生过一次在日本历史上罕见的大爆炸事件，使四百五十八名矿工死亡，近八百名矿工成为残废或半残废。
    三池煤矿工人为了反对美日反动派的野蛮统治，反对日本垄断资本的残酷压榨，争取生存的权利，从未停止过斗争。早在日本人民为反对日美“安全条约”而掀起伟大斗争的一九六○年，三池煤矿工人就不顾美日反动派的法西斯镇压，进行了震动世界的三池煤矿斗争，给美日反动派以沉重的打击。
    据三池煤矿工人揭露，美帝国主义为了在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策，最近几年来更加加紧与三井垄断资本集团勾结，用三池煤矿的煤炭作为原料，大量生产侵越战争中用来屠杀越南人民的毒药。
    最近日本三井垄断资本集团对三池煤矿工人的压榨和剥削更加变本加厉。
    不久以前，三井垄断资本集团对三池煤矿提出了所谓“第四次合理化提案”，企图进一步加强工人的劳动强度和使井下工人在更加危险的工作条件下卖命，来攫取最大利润。
    在资本家重重盘剥下，三池煤矿工人过着极端悲惨的生活。有的工人，工龄二十多年，但是工资仍然少得可怜。许多矿工由于无法养家，只得让自己的家属去做小工，受资本家更加残酷的盘剥。在矿井爆炸事件中自己的亲人受到伤亡的家属们的生活，更是无依无靠，毫无着落。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。三池煤矿的工人及其家属，心中燃烧着强烈的阶级仇恨的怒火。最近，三池煤矿的一百多名工人和过去在煤矿事故中自己的亲人受到伤亡的家属们，组织了起来，并从十一月九日起，在三池煤矿三川矿井的北门前，展开了静坐斗争，反对三井垄断资本集团提出的所谓“第四次合理化提案”，反对美日反动派进一步残酷压榨工人。
    不少工人表示，他们坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，决心打倒佐藤反动政府。他们在斗争现场附近用木料修建了“斗争小屋”和监视敌人动向的了望台，并且在四周插上了红旗。示威者个个头上都扎着一条写有斗争口号的手巾，昼夜不停地轮流进行静坐，他们已经坚持了近一个月的斗争。
    垄断资本集团对矿工和矿工家属的斗争怕得要命，把三川矿井北门紧闭起来，禁止人们和车辆进出，并且派出走狗和便衣特务把守大门，监视工人的行动。
    矿工们坚持斗争，并在斗争中学习毛主席著作。一些工人在一年半以前就组织了《毛主席语录》学习会，并且一直坚持到现在。参加这个学习会的工人说：日本工人必须彻底地和议会主义、经济主义、合法主义进行决裂，并肃清日共宫本修正主义集团长期以来给日本工人运动带来的极恶劣的影响。他们说：只有用毛泽东思想作指针进行革命，才能打败美日反动派。
