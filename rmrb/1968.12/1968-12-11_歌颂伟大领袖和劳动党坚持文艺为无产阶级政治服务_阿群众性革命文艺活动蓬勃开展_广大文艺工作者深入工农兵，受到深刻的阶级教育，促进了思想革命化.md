Albania's amateur and professional artists, following the teachings of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, have been actively implementing the policy of serving proletarian politics through art and vigorously promoting mass revolutionary art activities.

Since the beginning of this year, under the guidance of the Party on achieving the revolutionization of national life and people's thinking, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Albania have, in combination with the current situation, used a variety of artistic forms to quickly and extensively reflect the socialist revolution and construction that are vigorously underway throughout the country.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have enthusiastically sung the praises of the Party and the great leader Hoxha in their self-written and self-performed programs. In May, members of the agricultural cooperatives in the Tirana region sang revolutionary songs such as "Long Live the Brave Party!" and "Our Hearts Are Singing" at the music festival, expressing their boundless love for the Party and Comrade Hoxha. The elderly choir of Korça region sang in a simple and powerful voice, expressing the Albanian people's love for the Party and their heroic spirit in the struggle for the freedom and liberation of the motherland. In November, Skrapar region held a song festival with the theme "Singing the Party and Our New Life," praising the Albanian Party that leads the people from victory to victory.

In the nationwide movement for the revolutionization of thought, heroes such as the fifteen-year-old female hero Shkuta Vata, who sacrificed her life during voluntary labor on the construction of the Logar-Fier railway, and the young blind man Fadëll Zëra, who has long been fighting against difficulties to change the face of the mountains, have emerged. Since this year, many factories, enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and "cultural homes" have performed a large number of poems, dances, and plays, praising these heroes' high socialist consciousness and noble qualities.

Drawing creative themes from the current heated class struggle and production struggle, and reflecting the revolutionary spirit and creative power of the masses in a simple and understandable artistic form, is a prominent feature of Albanian mass amateur art. Recently, workers from the Enver Hoxha Machine Factory and the "December 21" Construction Company in Tirana have written and performed many short and lively art programs, vividly reflecting the current situation of strengthening workers' supervision and the technological revolution. The amateur actors of the Fier Chemical Plant recently performed a farce called "We Work and Stay Vigilant," expressing the workers' heroic spirit of holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other. Amateur art lovers in various rural areas have also performed many programs reflecting the new face of the countryside. Amateur art soldiers in the army performed programs such as "Guardians of the Motherland" and "Soldiers and People Are One Family," reflecting the glorious revolutionary traditions of the people's army. In addition, some workers, peasants, and soldiers have performed poems, enthusiastically welcoming Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou's telegram to Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu on September 17 this year, expressing the resolute support of 700 million Chinese people for Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact; some poems enthusiastically praise the great, unbreakable Albanian-Chinese friendship.

Professional artists in various places have continued to implement Comrade Hoxha's instructions on art creation, which should "permeate the Party's revolutionary fighting spirit and healthy national spirit" and "broadly reflect the struggles, labor, and life of the working people." They have further deepened their work at the grassroots level, more closely contacted the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and performed many programs with revolutionary content and national style for them. In recent months, various professional art troupes in the capital, Tirana, have gone to factories, villages, and military units to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers. Ballet, which was previously thought to be performed only in theaters, has now also gone out to the workers and peasants. Recently, the performers of the Tirana Opera and Ballet Theater performed many programs with revolutionary content for the miners and construction workers at the Mbore-Drenovë coal mine in Korça region and the construction site of the Vodej hydroelectric power station in Skrapar region. Through deepening contact with the masses, professional artists have received profound class education and tempering, promoting the revolutionization of thought.

    歌颂伟大领袖和劳动党坚持文艺为无产阶级政治服务
    阿群众性革命文艺活动蓬勃开展
    广大文艺工作者深入工农兵，受到深刻的阶级教育，促进了思想革命化
    据新华社地拉那八日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大业余和专业文艺工作者，遵循阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的教导，积极贯彻文艺为无产阶级政治服务的方针，大力开展群众性革命文艺活动。
    今年以来，阿尔巴尼亚各地广大工农兵业余文艺工作者在劳动党关于实现国家生活和人的思想革命化的指示下，结合当前形势，利用丰富多采的艺术形式，迅速地和广泛地反映正在全国轰轰烈烈进行的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    广大工农兵业余演员在他们自编自演的节目中，热情地歌颂劳动党和伟大领袖霍查同志。地拉那区农业合作社的社员在五月音乐节上演唱了《万岁，勇敢的党！》《我们的心在歌唱》等革命歌曲，表达了社员们对劳动党和霍查同志的无比热爱。科尔察区老人合唱队以朴素高亢的歌声，唱出了阿尔巴尼亚人民热爱劳动党的感情，表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民为争取祖国的自由和解放而进行斗争的英雄气概。斯库台区十一月还举行以《歌唱党和我们的新生活》为主题的歌曲会演，歌颂领导人民从胜利走向胜利的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。
    在席卷阿尔巴尼亚全国的思想革命化运动中，出现了在修建洛格齐恩—费里铁路的义务劳动中光荣牺牲的十五岁女英雄什库塔·瓦塔和为了改变山区面貌长期同困难作顽强斗争的青年盲人弗阿特·采拉等英雄人物。今年以来，许多地方的工厂企业、农业合作社和“文化之家”编演了大量的诗歌、舞蹈和话剧，赞扬这些英雄们高度的社会主义觉悟和高尚品质。
    从当前火热的阶级斗争和生产斗争中吸取创作题材，并用通俗易懂的文艺形式来反映群众的革命精神和创造力量，是阿尔巴尼亚群众业余文艺的一个显著特点。地拉那的恩维尔·霍查机械厂和“十二月二十一日”建筑公司等工厂企业的职工，最近自编自演了许多短小精悍的文艺节目，生动地反映了当前加强工人阶级监督和科学技术革命的情况。发罗拉制碱厂的业余演员最近演出了杂剧《我们劳动和警惕着》，表达了职工们一手拿镐、一手拿枪的英勇气概。各地农村的业余文艺爱好者也编演了许多反映农村新面貌的节目。部队业余文艺战士演出了《祖国的守卫者》、《军民是一家》等反映人民军光荣革命传统的节目。此外，一些工农兵业余演员还演出了一些诗歌，热烈欢呼毛主席、林副主席、周总理今年九月十七日打电报给霍查同志和谢胡同志，表示七亿中国人民坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚退出华沙条约的革命行动；有的诗歌热情歌颂伟大的、牢不可破的阿中友谊。
    各地的专业文艺工作者，今年以来继续贯彻霍查同志关于艺术创作“应该贯串党的革命的战斗精神以及健康的民族精神”并“广泛地反映劳动人民的斗争、劳动和生活”的指示，进一步深入基层，更多地接触工农兵群众，并为他们演出了许多具有革命内容和民族风格的节目。首都地拉那的各专业艺术团体，近几个月来纷纷下厂、下乡和下部队，为工农兵进行巡回演出。以前被认为只能在剧场演出的芭蕾舞，现在也走出剧场，来到了工农之中。地拉那歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院的演员们，最近就曾经到科尔察区的姆博雷—德雷诺维煤矿和斯库台区正在紧张建设中的沃德耶水电站工地，为矿工和建筑工人们演出了许多具有革命内容的节目。通过深入群众，使专业文艺工作者受到了深刻的阶级教育和锻炼，促进了思想革命化。
