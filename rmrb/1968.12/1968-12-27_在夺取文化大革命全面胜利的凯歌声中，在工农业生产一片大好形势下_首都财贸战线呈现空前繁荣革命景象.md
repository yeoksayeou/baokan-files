In the midst of the triumphant songs of the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution and the excellent situation of industrial and agricultural production, the financial and commercial front in the capital presents an unprecedented prosperous revolutionary scene. The wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging, financial revenue is continuously increasing, urban and rural material exchanges are smooth, market supplies are abundant, prices are stable, and both buying and selling are brisk.

On the eve of the New Year, from the large department stores in the center of Beijing to the supply and marketing cooperatives and branch stores in the remote rural areas of the suburbs, one can see the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and the quotations from Chairman Mao everywhere. The shelves are filled with a variety of needle and cotton textiles, cultural supplies, and daily necessities. In various food stores and vegetable markets, meat, eggs, fresh vegetables, dried and fresh fruits, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, and other foodstuffs are abundantly supplied. This year, the sales of major commodities such as woolen fabrics, towels, soap, and transistor radios in the city have increased significantly compared to the past two years. The industrial products such as sewing machines, bicycles, and wool yarn purchased by the broad masses of farmers in the suburbs are two to six times more than in 1966. This fully demonstrates the improvement in the purchasing power and living standards of the broad revolutionary masses, especially the suburban farmers, since the Cultural Revolution.

The Cultural Revolution is a great driving force for socialist production in our country. The working class and poor and lower-middle peasants in the capital, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution and promote production," have vigorously grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving abundant results and providing a solid material foundation for the prosperity of the market. The commercial departments this year have collected a total value of daily industrial products and agricultural and sideline products that have exceeded last year. Since February, the amount of daily industrial products collected has increased month by month, with many varieties exceeding the highest levels in history. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs, who have achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture, joyfully handed over grain, cotton, oil, vegetables, fruits, and other products to the state in large quantities, with cotton already exceeding the state's collection plan by more than a month.

Politics is the commander and the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Currently, a magnificent movement to fully implement the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines is vigorously unfolding on the financial and commercial front in Beijing. From the leadership organs at various levels to the business and service sites, from processing plants and warehouses to import and export trade units, everywhere is a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, and everywhere is a battlefield for deeply exposing and criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents. The revolutionary committees at various levels have fully mobilized and relied on the masses to deeply carry out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, rooting out a handful of class enemies hidden on the financial and commercial front. The broad revolutionary cadres have greatly heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness in the struggle against the enemy. They deeply understand that Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is the black line of restoring capitalism; Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the red line leading to communism, and it is the lifeline for doing a good job in socialist economic and financial work.

The broad revolutionary cadres on the financial and commercial front in the capital are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," following Chairman Mao's financial and economic work policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" and the great teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people." They have thoroughly criticized and transformed capitalist management ideas and styles, reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, and established socialist management ideas and styles that serve proletarian politics, develop socialist production, and serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many commercial wholesale departments and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives use the method of "inviting in and sending out" to widely solicit the opinions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many stores and service industry units have reasonably adjusted business hours, improved service attitudes, and enhanced service quality, receiving praise from the broad revolutionary masses.

    在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在工农业生产一片大好形势下
    首都财贸战线呈现空前繁荣革命景象
    斗批改热潮波澜壮阔，财政收入不断增长，城乡物资交流畅通，市场商品供应充沛
    新华社二十六日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在工农业生产一片大好的形势下，首都财贸战线呈现出空前繁荣的革命景象，斗、批、改热潮波澜壮阔，财政收入不断增长，城乡物资交流畅通，市场商品供应充沛，物价稳定，购销两旺。
    新年前夕，从北京市中心的大商场到远郊山区农村的供销社、分销店里，到处可以看到伟大领袖毛主席画像和毛主席语录。货架上，摆满了花色品种齐全的针棉织品、文化用品和日用百货。各食品店、菜市场里，肉类、蛋品、鲜菜、干鲜果品、烟、酒、糖等副食品充足供应。今年以来，全市销售的呢绒、毛巾、肥皂、半导体收音机等主要商品，比过去两年都有大幅度增长。郊区广大农民购买的缝纫机、自行车、毛线等工业品，为一九六六年的两倍到六倍以上。这充分显示出文化大革命以来，广大革命群众的购买力、特别是郊区农民的购买力的提高和生活的改善。
    无产阶级文化大革命是我国社会主义生产的伟大推动力。首都的工人阶级和贫下中农，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了丰硕的成果，为市场繁荣提供了雄厚的物质基础。商业部门今年收购的日用工业品和农副产品的总值都超过了去年。从二月份起，收购日用工业品的数量逐月增多，其中有不少品种都超过了历史上的最高水平。获得农业大丰收的郊区广大贫下中农，喜气洋洋地把粮食、棉花、油料、蔬菜、果品等，踊跃交售给国家，其中棉花已经提前一个多月超额完成了国家收购计划。
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”。目前，一个气势磅礴的全面落实党的八届十二中全会公报和认真学习两条路线斗争史的群众运动，正在北京市财贸战线蓬勃展开。从各级财贸领导机关到营业服务场所，从加工厂、仓库到进出口贸易单位，到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，到处是深揭狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人的战场。各级革命委员会充分发动和依靠群众，深入开展清理阶级队伍的工作，挖出了一小撮隐藏到财贸战线的阶级敌人。广大革命职工在对敌斗争的过程中，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们深刻地认识到，刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线是复辟资本主义的黑线；毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是通向共产主义的红线，是搞好社会主义经济工作和财政工作的生命线。
    首都财贸战线的广大革命职工坚决贯彻毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的最新指示，遵照毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的财经工作的总方针和“全心全意地为人民服务”的伟大教导，大破资本主义经营思想和经营作风，改革不合理的规章制度，大立为无产阶级政治服务、为发展社会主义生产服务、为广大工农兵群众服务的社会主义经营思想和经营作风。不少商业批发部门和基层供销社，用“请进来、派出去”的办法，广泛征求工农兵群众的意见。许多商店和服务行业单位，合理地调整了营业时间，改进了服务态度，提高了服务质量，受到了广大革命群众的赞扬。
