Our commune health clinic is a self-sustaining unit. In the past, due to the influence and poisoning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi, there was a wrong tendency among medical personnel to "focus on patients, focus on income." Some people thought: we are doctors, we are in charge of treating diseases, and preventive work is the responsibility of the epidemic prevention station. As a result, treatment and prevention were separated, preventive work was not done well, the incidence rate of commune members was high, doctors were busy, and the lives of commune members and collective production were also affected.

Later, all medical personnel, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts in the "Three Articles," went deep into the production brigades, deep into the poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with the semi-farm semi-medical personnel and health workers of each brigade, we vigorously carried out preventive work, significantly reducing the incidence rate of commune members. There was a disease that was quite prevalent in our commune a few years ago. Last spring, medical personnel all went to the countryside, divided into areas, and took responsibility for them. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, we insisted on the "five together" (eating together, living together, working together, studying together, and criticizing and repudiating revisionism together) and together with the semi-farm semi-medical personnel and health workers, we propagated the prevention of diseases. We truly achieved the goal of treating when there is a disease and preventing when there is no disease, combining prevention and treatment, and significantly reducing the incidence rate. The preventive work in Xicaolu Brigade was well done, and this prevalent disease did not occur at all last year and this year. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "You doctors came down, and we have someone to see when we are sick. When we are not sick, we all do prevention together. It's great to grasp revolution and promote production." We believe that implementing the cooperative medical care system can better implement the policy of "prevention first, prevention over treatment," making the poor and lower-middle peasants less likely to get sick or not get sick at all, and creating favorable conditions for "grasping revolution and promoting production" to achieve even greater agricultural harvests.

    合作医疗是落实“防重于治”的根本措施
    我们公社卫生院，是自负盈亏的单位，过去由于受到大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义卫生路线的影响和毒害，在医务人员中曾经出现一种“抓病人，抓收入”的错误倾向。有的人认为：咱是医生，是管看病的，预防工作是防疫站的事。结果，治疗、预防分家，预防工作做得不好，社员发病率高，医生忙得团团转，社员生活和集体生产也受到了影响。后来，我们全体医务人员，在毛主席“老三篇”光辉思想指引下，深入各大队，深入贫下中农，和各大队的半农半医、卫生员一起狠抓预防工作，使社员发病率大大减少。有一种病前几年在我公社比较流行。去年一开春，医务人员就统统下乡，分片包干，和贫下中农坚持五同（同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修），和半农半医、卫生员一起宣传预防疾病，真正做到了有病就治，无病就防，防治结合，使发病率大大减低。西草芦大队预防工作做得好，去年和今年这种流行病根本没有发生。贫下中农说：“你们医生下来，俺们有病有人看，没有病大家搞预防，抓革命，促生产就带劲啦。”我们认为：实行合作医疗制度，就能更好地落实“预防为主，防重于治”的方针，使贫下中农少得病或不得病，为“抓革命，促生产”，夺取农业更大丰收创造有利条件。
