Edition: 2

Great Leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The experience of history is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be frequently and repeatedly spoken about. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." The "Model Red Ninth Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Works," which is currently carrying out the task of supporting the left, and some cadres from the "May Seventh" Cadres School in Liuhe, Heilongjiang Province, who are visiting and learning from the Red Ninth Company, studied Chairman Mao's latest directive together, reviewed Chairman Mao's "Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," and held a meeting to share experiences on studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. They learned from each other, encouraged each other, and discussed their experiences in further raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation through studying the history of the struggle between the two lines.

		Frequently and Repeatedly Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines
		Continuously Raise the Consciousness of Carrying Out Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." The cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company and the cadres from the "May Seventh" Cadres School in Liuhe unanimously said that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is precisely developed through struggles against various opportunist lines within the party, especially against the reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi. We must continuously study the history of the struggle between the two lines in the midst of struggle, so as to deeply understand the unparalleled brilliance, greatness, and correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to deeply root our loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to raise our consciousness of carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	At the meeting, many comrades from the Red Ninth Company linked the company's growth in the struggle between the two lines and shared their personal experiences of continuously raising their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. The Red Ninth Company is a Red Army company personally established by Chairman Mao. From the Autumn Harvest Uprising to the struggle in Jinggangshan, from the Long March to the Battle of Pingxingguan, and all the way to the liberation of the entire country, the Red Ninth Company has always advanced victoriously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company said, "Decades ago, we lived thanks to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and for decades, we have grown thanks to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is because of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that there is the Red Ninth Company. The Red Ninth Company will forever be a company loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." In 1964, during the period when the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ronghuan spread the evil wind of large-scale military exercises, viciously attacking and strongly obstructing the Red Ninth Company's study of Chairman Mao's works, we studied the history of the two-line struggle within the party, exposed Luo Ronghuan's evil plot of opposing the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and repeatedly withstood the evil wind of large-scale military exercises, causing Luo Ronghuan's bourgeois military line to fail. In this fierce struggle between the two lines, the Red Ninth Company tempered a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Political Instructor Qiao Yunqi deeply felt: "In our struggle against the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, each time we study the history of the two-line struggle within the party, each time we review the company's growth in the two-line struggle, we deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and increase our hatred for the reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi. Through study, we have an even deeper love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and have raised our consciousness of carrying out and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

	The cadres from the "May Seventh" Cadres School in Liuhe expressed that they would learn from the Red Ninth Company to seriously study the history of the two-line struggle within the party, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, deeply root their loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever be strong warriors in defending and carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

		Combine the Study of the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines with the Current Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

	The cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company and the cadres from the "May Seventh" Cadres School in Liuhe unanimously believe that the purpose of studying the history of the struggle between the two lines is to raise class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Their common experience in study is that by combining the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines with the current two-line struggle, they can more deeply understand the great significance of thoroughly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, and can more consciously carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	At the meeting, the outstanding soldier and squad leader Sun Hongxiang introduced how he helped the members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Casting Plant of the First Automobile Works in Changchun study the history of the struggle between the two lines, raise their two-line struggle consciousness, apply Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on political construction of the army to the construction of political power and enterprise management, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Casting Plant, some members of the committee relaxed the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the midst of celebrating victory, and a small handful of class enemies took the opportunity to spread rumors and slander, attempting to sabotage the struggle, criticism, and transformation. At this time, Sun Hongxiang immediately helped the members of the Revolutionary Committee hold a class on the history of the two-line struggle within the party, and together with everyone, with the problems in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, seriously studied the history of the two-line struggle within the party, reviewed the great teachings of Great Leader Chairman Mao about "winning nationwide victory is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li" and "the Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous," and together with everyone, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "technology first," "money as the commander," and "material incentives" advocated by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, making everyone clearly understand that whether to take the road of proletarian political construction of the factory is a major issue related to whether the new revolutionary political power can be consolidated. On the basis of raising the two-line struggle consciousness, the members of the Revolutionary Committee of this factory went deep into the front line of struggle, relying on the masses of workers to expose a small handful of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Subsequently, they mobilized the masses to reform unreasonable rules and regulations. Deep revolution made the entire factory present a new political situation, with revolution and production boiling.

	At the meeting, Liuhe "May Seventh" Cadres School cadre Wang Yan also introduced how he, through the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, raised his two-line struggle consciousness and, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, strove to transform his worldview. Wang Yan was originally a young cadre of the old Heilongjiang Provincial Committee. During the Cultural Revolution, he, with a loyal heart to Great Leader Chairman Mao, bravely and resolutely fought against Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line, receiving great tempering. However, when the Cultural Revolution entered the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, he produced the idea of self-congratulation, thinking that he should not be sent down to labor. Later, he, with this active thought, studied Chairman Mao's teachings in the report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee about "We must make sure that comrades continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and unassuming, and we must make sure that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle" and Chairman Mao's latest directive on sending a large number of cadres down to labor, deeply realized that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line guides us not to separate from labor, not to separate from the masses, educates us to closely connect with the masses, and is the only correct line for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, while the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi crazily promotes the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, advocating officialdom and being a lord, is precisely to make us become revisionists. If one does not want to be sent down to labor, one would fall into Liu Shaoqi's trap. After recognizing and raising his consciousness through study, he happily participated in the "May Seventh" Cadres School, receiving great tempering in labor, and his ideological revolutionization made a new leap.

		Deeply Carry Out Revolutionary Criticism, Further Raise the Two-Line Struggle Consciousness, and Carry the Cultural Revolution Through to the End

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." At the meeting, the cadres and soldiers of the Red Ninth Company and the cadres from the "May Seventh" Cadres School in Liuhe discussed their experiences in using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, further raising their two-line struggle consciousness in studying the history of the struggle between the two lines. They said that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, represented by Liu Shaoqi, in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, always wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, attempting to confuse the boundaries between the two lines. We study the history of the struggle between the two lines, first of all, to draw the boundaries between the two lines, and using Mao Zedong Thought to carry out revolutionary criticism is precisely the best way to draw the boundaries between the two lines.

	The deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of the "May Seventh" Cadres School in Liuhe, Wen Rongxi, shared his experiences in this regard at the meeting. Wen Rongxi is an old cadre who participated in the revolution during the Anti-Japanese War. He said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'There may be some communists who have never been defeated by armed enemies, who are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation.' I am precisely the one who has been defeated in front of sugar bullets, in front of the revisionist line. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary criticism is like a mirror that exposes demons, exposing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary face, also making my mind clear, making me return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

	At the meeting, everyone resolutely expressed that they must further deeply carry out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, eliminate its poison, firmly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, raise the consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    做自觉执行毛主席革命路线的坚强战士
    ——红九连指战员和柳河“五·七”干校部分学员交流学习两条路线斗争史的体会
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”正在执行支左任务的“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”和正在红九连参观学习的黑龙江省柳河“五·七”干校的部分学员，一起学习毛主席的这一最新指示，一起重温毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，一起举行学习两条路线斗争史的讲用会。他们互相学习，互相勉励，畅谈了通过学习两条路线斗争史，进一步提高两条路线斗争觉悟，认真搞好斗、批、改的体会。
      经常地反复地学习两条路线斗争史
  不断提高执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”红九连的指战员和柳河“五·七”干校的学员们一致谈到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，正是在同党内形形色色的“左”右倾机会主义路线，特别是同以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线作斗争中发展起来的。我们只有在斗争中不断地学习两条路线斗争的历史，才能更深刻地体会到毛主席革命路线的无比英明、无比伟大、无比正确，才能把对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的忠根扎得深深的，把执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性提得高高的。
    在讲用会上，红九连许多同志联系连队在两条路线斗争中成长的战斗历程，畅谈了怎样不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟的切身体会。红九连是毛主席亲手创建的一个红军连队。从秋收起义到井冈山斗争，从二万五千里长征到平型关大战，一直到解放全中国，红九连一直是沿着毛主席革命路线胜利前进的。红九连的指战员们说，几十年以前，我们靠毛主席革命路线生，几十年以来，我们又靠毛主席革命路线长。有毛主席革命路线，才有我们红九连。我们红九连永远是忠于毛主席革命路线的红九连。一九六四年，在反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起大比武的妖风，恶毒攻击和极力阻挠红九连学习毛主席著作的那段时间里，我们学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，识破了罗瑞卿反对活学活用毛泽东思想的罪恶阴谋，一次又一次地顶住了大比武的妖风，使罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线遭到破产。在这场两条路线的激烈斗争中，我们红九连锤炼了一颗无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红心。连指导员乔云歧深有体会地说：“我们在同叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿作斗争中，每学习一次两条路线斗争的历史，每回顾一次连队在两条路线斗争中成长的历程，就对毛主席的革命路线加深一层理解，对以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线更加仇恨。通过学习，我们对毛主席的革命路线更加无限热爱，提高了我们执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性。”
    柳河“五·七”干校的学员们表示，要象红九连那样认真学习党内两条路线斗争史，把刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线批得臭臭的，把对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的忠根扎得牢牢的，永远做捍卫和执行毛主席革命路线的坚强战士。
        把学习两条路线斗争史和当前
    正在进行的斗、批、改结合起来
    红九连指战员和柳河“五·七”干校的学员们一致认为，学习两条路线斗争史的目的，在于提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，认真搞好斗、批、改。他们在学习中的共同体会是，把学习两条路线斗争史和现实的两条路线斗争结合起来，就能够更深刻地认识到彻底搞好斗、批、改，对于巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的伟大意义，就能够更自觉地执行毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在讲用会上，五好战士、班长孙洪祥介绍了他帮助长春第一汽车制造厂铸造厂革委会成员学习两条路线斗争史，提高两条路线斗争觉悟，把毛主席政治建军的光辉思想运用到政权建设和企业管理中去，认真搞好斗、批、改的体会。铸造厂革委会成立以后，革委会中有些成员在欢庆胜利的锣鼓声中放松了斗、批、改，一小撮阶级敌人便趁机散布流言蜚语，妄图破坏斗、批、改。这时，孙洪祥立即帮助革委会成员举办两条路线斗争史学习班，和大家一起，带着斗、批、改中的问题，认真学习党内两条路线斗争史，重温伟大领袖毛主席关于“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦”的伟大教导，同大家一起狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇竭力鼓吹的“技术第一”、“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义谬论，使大家明确认识到，是否走无产阶级政治建厂的道路，是关系到新生的革命政权能否巩固的大问题。在提高两条路线斗争觉悟的基础上，这个厂的革委会成员深入到斗争第一线，依靠工人群众揪出了一小撮妄图破坏斗、批、改的阶级敌人。接着，他们广泛发动群众改革不合理的规章制度。深刻的革命使全厂出现了崭新的政治局面，革命、生产热气腾腾。
    在讲用会上，柳河“五·七”干校学员王延同志还介绍了自己怎样通过两条路线斗争史的学习，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，以无产阶级的彻底革命精神，努力改造世界观的体会。王延原来是旧黑龙江省委的一个青年干部。在文化大革命中，他怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，在同刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线作斗争中坚决勇敢，受到很大锻炼。但是，在文化大革命进入斗、批、改阶段后产生了居功自傲的思想，认为自己不应下放劳动。后来，他带着这个活思想，学习了毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告中关于“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导和毛主席关于广大干部下放劳动的最新指示，深刻认识到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引我们不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，教育我们密切联系群众，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的唯一正确的路线，而叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线，鼓吹做官当老爷，就是要想使我们变修，如果不愿下放劳动，就正好上了刘少奇的当。他通过学习认识提高后，愉快地参加了“五·七”干校，在劳动中受到了很大锻炼，思想革命化出现了新的飞跃。
    深入开展革命大批判，进一步提高两条路线斗争觉悟，把文化大革命进行到底
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”在讲用会上，红九连的指战员和柳河“五·七”干校的学员们畅谈了自己在学习两条路线斗争史中，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入开展革命大批判，进一步提高了两条路线斗争觉悟的体会。他们说，以刘少奇为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派在推行反革命修正主义路线时，总是打着红旗反红旗，妄图混淆两条路线的界限，我们学习两条路线斗争史，首先就要划清两条路线的界限，而用毛泽东思想开展革命大批判正是划清两条路线界限的最好办法。
    柳河“五·七”干校革委会副主任温融洗在讲用会上讲了他在这方面的体会。温融洗是抗日战争时期参加革命的老干部。他说：“毛主席教导我们：‘可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。’我就是在糖弹面前，在修正主义路线面前，打过败仗的。无产阶级文化大革命中，革命大批判就象照妖镜一样，照出了刘少奇的反革命面目，也使我的头脑清醒起来了，使我又回到毛主席的革命路线上来了。”
    在讲用会上，大家坚决表示，一定要更深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步把刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线彻底批深批臭，清除它的毒素，牢牢掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
