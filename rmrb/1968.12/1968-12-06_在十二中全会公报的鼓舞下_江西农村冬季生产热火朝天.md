Inspired by the Communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi's countryside are, after achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest this year, continuing to advance, launching a vigorous winter production campaign, and actively creating conditions for a new leap forward in agricultural production next year.

In the current vigorous mass movement in Jiangxi's countryside to propagate, study, and implement the Communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are racing against time to speed up winter sowing, expand the area of winter sowing, and improve the quality of winter sowing. The more than 25 million mu of green manure, rapeseed, and wheat that have already been sown are of better quality than in previous years. Water conservancy projects for winter repairs have also started earlier and progressed faster than in previous years. The sowing of red clover, prepared as base fertilizer for next year's early rice, has been completed. This year, Ganzhou Prefecture has sown the most red clover in its history. Various places are actively engaged in winter fertilizer accumulation, land leveling, soil improvement, and expansion of cultivated land.

This year, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line of our great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi's countryside have achieved victories in both revolution and production. After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has become even more deeply rooted in the countryside of the entire province, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been swiftly implemented. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," have launched relentless attacks on a handful of class enemies. They have carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" promoted by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his local agents, and have dealt heavy blows to the activities of a handful of class enemies sabotaging the socialist collective economy. They have further consolidated and developed the socialist stronghold in the countryside, bringing about profound changes in the rural landscape.

Various places in the countryside have also launched a mass movement to learn from Dazhai in agriculture. County, commune, and brigade-level revolutionary committees have all established a number of models that follow the Dazhai spirit in construction, widely promoting the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, sail in the direction of victory indicated by the Communiqué of the Plenary Session, and achieve new leaps forward in revolution and production next year.

    在十二中全会公报的鼓舞下
    江西农村冬季生产热火朝天
    据新华社南昌五日电　江西省农村广大贫下中农，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，在夺得今年农业生产全面丰收后，继续乘胜前进，掀起了热火朝天的冬季生产高潮，积极为明年农业生产的新跃进创造条件。
    在当前江西农村轰轰烈烈地开展的宣传、学习、落实党的八届十二中全会公报的群众运动中，广大贫下中农争分夺秒地加快冬种进度，扩大冬种面积，提高冬种质量。已经播种的二千五百多万亩绿肥、油菜、大小麦，质量比往年都好。冬修水利工作也比往年动手早、行动快。为明年早稻准备基肥的红花草，播种工作已经全面结束。赣州专区今年是历史上播种红花草最多的一年。各地冬季积肥造肥，平整田地，改良土壤，扩大耕地面积，都在积极进行。
    今年，江西农村广大贫下中农在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，革命与生产取得了双胜利。经过两年多的无产阶级文化大革命，毛泽东思想在全省农村更加深入人心，毛主席一系列最新指示迅速得到落实。广大贫下中农遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，不停顿地向一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。他们深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批党内头号走资派刘少奇及其在当地代理人所推行的“三自一包”“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人破坏社会主义集体经济的活动，进一步巩固和发展了农村社会主义阵地，使农村面貌发生了深刻变化。
    各地农村还开展了农业学大寨的群众运动，县、社、队各级革委会都树立了一批按照大寨精神搞建设的活样板，使自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神得到广泛发扬。广大贫下中农决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，按照全会公报指引的胜利航向，夺取明年革命、生产的新跃进。
