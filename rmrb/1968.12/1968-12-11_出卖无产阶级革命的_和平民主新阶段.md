Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people fought for eight years and finally won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This was a great turning point in history. The question was: "Should we establish a new democratic state led by the proletariat and for the people, or should we establish a semi-colonial, semi-feudal state ruled by the big landlords and big bourgeoisie?" Two paths lay before the Chinese people. At this crucial moment, Liu Shaoqi stepped forward and put forth the counterrevolutionary fallacy of the "peaceful democratic new stage."

Liu Shaoqi's peddling of the "peaceful democratic new stage" was so servile in its praise of American imperialism, claiming that "the United States does not want China to have a civil war." It was also so shameless in its whitewashing of the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek. He said things like "there will be no civil war," and "Chiang Kai-shek can work with us to build a democratic country." He spared no effort in promoting the parliamentary road, endlessly talking about how "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary struggle, and the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle." He shouted at the top of his lungs about "dissolving the party committees, political commissars, and political departments of our army," and "reorganizing the army, making our army the national army, national defense army, and security forces," and "some people will go to be officials, officials of the central government." He had ulterior motives, wanting us to allow the Kuomintang reactionaries "to come to the liberated areas to operate, set up news agencies, and publish newspapers," and let the Kuomintang "come to participate in our government." Enough! From the few paragraphs quoted above, we can clearly see that this "peaceful democratic new stage" is a thorough and complete revisionist political program. Its essence is to sell out the proletarian revolution.

As early as before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the great leader Chairman Mao had already foresightedly pointed out: "Chiang Kai-shek wants to launch a nationwide civil war, and his policy has been decided. We must be prepared for this."

"Chiang Kai-shek will seize every inch of power and every bit of profit from the people." Just after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialism instigated its running dog Chiang Kai-shek to launch a savage attack on the liberated areas. From September 1945 to June 1946, American imperialism helped Chiang Kai-shek transport 540,000 troops to surround and attack the liberated areas; from July to October 1945, the Kuomintang bandits launched large-scale attacks on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Shanxi Upper Party Region, and the Hebei Handan Region. Is this not "the United States does not want China to have a civil war"? Is this not "Chiang Kai-shek can work with us to build a democratic country"? In the face of the clamor of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's sharpening of their knives, this scoundrel Liu Shaoqi was chanting the "peace" scripture, shamelessly whitewashing American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. His evil purpose is not clear? He wanted to confuse the situation, lull the people's fighting spirit, make us stand by and wait to be slaughtered by the Kuomintang reactionaries, make us hand over the fruits of our eight-year bloody struggle to the Kuomintang reactionaries, and make our country fall into the hands of American imperialism as a colony. If we had followed him, our country would still be the dark old China ruled by the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and it would be impossible to have today's bright new China under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Our party, our people, and our People's Liberation Army are all personally created and led by the great commander Chairman Mao, and are armed with the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong. Liu Shaoqi's tricks have no effect on us. At the time when Liu Shaoqi was actively peddling the "peaceful democratic new stage," our troops, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "the rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle," launched a counterattack on the enemy troops on the Jiaoji Line and the Jinpu Line in Shandong. In less than a week, we liberated more than ten towns including Jiaozhou, Zhangdian, and Zhoucun, and with practical actions, we smashed Liu Shaoqi's capitulationist line and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly exposed Liu Shaoqi's treacherous, traitorous, and counterrevolutionary face, eliminating a major hidden danger in our party. This is a great victory for the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong. Today, as we review the history of the struggle between the two lines after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we see more clearly the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end.

### 出卖无产阶级革命的“和平民主新阶段”

    出卖无产阶级革命的“和平民主新阶段”
    济南部队某部政委  曹普南
    中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，经过八年的浴血奋战，取得了抗日战争的最后胜利。这是一个伟大的历史转折。“是建立一个无产阶级领导的人民大众的新民主主义的国家呢，还是建立一个大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家？”两种前途摆在中国人民面前。在这个关键时刻，刘少奇跳出来，抛出了“和平民主新阶段”的反革命谬论。
    刘少奇贩卖的“和平民主新阶段”是那样奴颜婢膝地赞颂美帝国主义，胡说“美国也不愿意中国打内战”；又是那样恬不知耻地为人民公敌蒋介石涂脂抹粉。他胡说什么“内战是不会打了”，蒋介石“能和我们办民主建国”。他竭尽全力地兜售议会道路，喋喋不休地说什么“中国革命主要斗争形式已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争”。他声嘶力竭地大叫大嚷“我军的支部、党委会、政治委员取消”，“军队也要整编，我们的军队成为国军、国防军、保安队”，“有些人要去做官，中央政府的官”。他别有用心地要我们允许国民党反动派“到解放区来活动，设通讯社，办报纸”，让国民党“来参加我们的政府”。够了！就从上面摘录的几段话中，我们就可以清楚地看到这个
  “和平民主新阶段”是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义政治纲领。其要害就是要出卖无产阶级革命。
    早在抗日战争胜利前夕，伟大领袖毛主席就高瞻远瞩地指出：“蒋介石要发动全国规模的内战，他的方针已经定了，我们对此要有准备。”
  “蒋介石对于人民是寸权必夺，寸利必得。”抗日战争刚刚胜利，美帝国主义就唆使它的走狗蒋介石向解放区发动了猖狂进攻。从一九四五年九月到一九四六年六月，美帝国主义帮助蒋介石运兵五十四万，包围和进攻解放区；从一九四五年的七月到十月，蒋介石匪帮连续向我陕甘宁边区、山西上党地区和河北邯郸地区发动了大规模的进攻。这难道是“美国也不愿意中国打内战”吗？这难道是蒋介石“和我们办民主建国”吗？在美帝国主义和蒋介石的霍霍磨刀声中，在烽烟漫天的炮火面前，刘少奇这个大坏蛋，却大念“和平”经，无耻地为美帝国主义和蒋介石涂脂抹粉。其罪恶目的不是一清二楚的吗？他就是为了混淆视听，麻痹人民的斗志，要我们在国民党反动派的大举进攻面前束手待毙，要我们把八年浴血抗战的胜利果实，拱手送给国民党反动派，使我国沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。如果依了他，我国将依然是大地主、大资产阶级专政的无比黑暗的旧中国，根本不可能有今天这样的无产阶级专政的无限光明的新中国。
    我们党，我国人民，我们人民解放军是伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的。刘少奇的这一套对我们是根本不起作用的。就在刘少奇积极贩卖“和平民主新阶段”的时候，我们部队根据伟大领袖毛主席“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的教导，在山东对胶济线和津浦线的敌军发动了反击战。用不到一周的时间解放了胶县、张店、周村等十余个城镇，用实际行动粉碎了刘少奇的投降主义路线，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    无产阶级文化大革命彻底揭露了刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼的反革命嘴脸，消除了我们党的一大隐患。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。在今天，我们回顾抗日战争胜利后这段两条路线斗争的历史，更加清楚地看到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无比正确。我们要永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。
