The fire of French students' struggle against government repression and the decaying education system has once again spread from Paris to various provinces. In recent days, large numbers of students in cities such as Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Nantes, Strasbourg, and Montpellier have defied government threats and intimidation, staging walkouts and demonstrations. They have also occupied schools to express their strong protest against the French ruling class.

In the French capital, Paris, students from the Faculty of Letters at the University of Paris-Nanterre, who first ignited this struggle, continue to bravely hold their ground despite being surrounded by a large number of gendarmes and police. Many teachers sympathize with and support the students' just struggle. They issued a statement refusing to teach under police surveillance. Nearly 20,000 students at the Faculty of Letters at the University of Paris-Nanterre have stopped classes entirely.

Students from other parts of the University of Paris held a meeting at the Sorbonne on the 17th to protest against the government's repression of the student movement and to support the students of the Faculty of Letters at the University of Paris-Nanterre. The French government deployed a large number of police to surround the Sorbonne, preventing students from entering the campus to attend the meeting. This infuriated the students, who held a demonstration march in the university district on the Left Bank of the Seine, singing the "Internationale" and chanting slogans such as "Liberate the University of Paris!" and "The struggle continues!" to express their strong protest against the government.

In Lyon, France's third-largest city, large numbers of students defied Prime Minister Pompidou's order not to occupy schools. On the evening of the 16th, the day Pompidou made his speech, they occupied an office in the medical school.

In Toulouse, France's fourth-largest city, students also took action to occupy school buildings. Law students, despite the school administration's ban, screened a documentary film of the French people's revolutionary storm in May and June this year in the school's lecture hall. The reactionary authorities sent a large number of police, using tear gas to brutally suppress the students. The police's violence aroused the indignation of the broad masses of teachers. They decided to go on strike to support the students' struggle and protest against the government's repression of the student movement.

In Strasbourg, a large city in northeastern France, more than 3,000 university students held a rally at the University of Strasbourg to protest against the government's arrest and persecution of young students. They stated that if the government did not release the unjustly arrested youths, they would go on an indefinite strike.

In Grenoble, in southeastern France, angry university students at a rally drove away the university president who was justifying the French government's reactionary policies. In Montpellier, in southern France, 1,800 pharmacy students have been on an indefinite strike since the 17th to protest against the French government.

The French ruling class is terrified and enraged by the resurgence of the student movement. French Prime Minister Pompidou exclaimed on the 16th that France is facing "a major showdown." He called on all the bourgeois parties in France to unite around the government to restore "order."

    法国学生斗争烈火迅速蔓延全国
    巴黎、里昂、图卢兹、南特等地学生罢课示威反对当局镇压学生运动统治集团惊慌万状　总理德姆维尔惊呼面临“一场大决战”
    新华社十八日讯　巴黎消息：法国学生反对政府镇压学生运动，反对腐朽教育制度的斗争怒火，又一次从巴黎向各省迅速蔓延。最近几天，巴黎、里昂、图卢兹、南特、斯特拉斯堡、蒙彼利埃等城市的大批学生，不顾政府的恫吓和威胁，纷纷举行罢课示威，并且占领学校，向法国统治集团表示强烈的抗议。
    在法国首都巴黎，首先燃起这次斗争烈火的巴黎大学农泰尔文学院的学生，在大批宪兵和警察的包围中，继续英勇地坚持罢课。许多教师同情并支持学生的正义斗争。他们发表声明，拒绝在警察的包围中授课。有将近两万学生的农泰尔文学院十七日已经全部停课。
    巴黎大学的其他学生，十七日还在索邦校本部举行大会，抗议政府镇压学生运动，声援农泰尔文学院学生的斗争。法国政府调集大批警察包围了巴黎大学校本部，不让学生进入校园参加会议。这激起学生们极大的愤怒。他们在塞纳河左岸巴黎的大学区举行了示威游行，高唱《国际歌》，高呼“解放巴黎大学！”，“战斗在继续！”等口号，向政府表示强烈的抗议。
    在法国的第三大城市里昂，大批学生蔑视法国总理德姆维尔不许学生占领学校的禁令，在德姆维尔十六日讲话的当天晚上，他们就占领了医学院的一个办公室。
    在法国的第四大城市图卢兹，学生们也采取了占领学校大楼的行动。法律学院的学生，不顾学校当局的禁令，在学校讲课大厅里放映今年五、六月法国人民革命风暴的纪录影片。反动当局出动了大批警察，使用催泪瓦斯对学生进行残暴镇压。警察的暴行激起了广大教师的义愤。他们决定举行罢教，以声援学生的斗争，并抗议政府镇压学生运动。
    在法国东北的大城市斯特拉斯堡，三千多名大学生在斯特拉斯堡大学举行了集会，抗议政府逮捕并迫害青年学生。他们表示，如果政府不释放被无理逮捕的青年，他们将举行无限期罢课。
    在法国东南部的格勒诺布勒，愤怒的大学生在一次集会上哄走了为法国政府的反动政策辩解的大学校长。在法国南部的蒙彼利埃，一千八百名学药物的学生从十七日起举行无限期罢课，向法国政府表示抗议。
    法国统治集团对于学生运动的再起怕得要死，恨得要命。法国总理德姆维尔十六日惊呼，法国面临“一场大决战”。他要求法国的各个资产阶级政党团结在政府的周围，共同恢复“秩序”。
