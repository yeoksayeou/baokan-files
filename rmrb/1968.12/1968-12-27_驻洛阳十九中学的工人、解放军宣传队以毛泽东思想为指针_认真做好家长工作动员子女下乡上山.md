The workers and military Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the No. 19 Middle School in Luoyang, Henan Province, have used Mao Zedong Thought as their guide in mobilizing graduates to go to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants. They have done thorough political and ideological work among the students' parents, encouraging them to support their children in going to the countryside to settle down.

More than 80% of the students at Luoyang No. 19 Middle School are children of urban cadres and residents. Over the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the students' parents have studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and recognized the harm caused by the old schools and educational system to the younger generation. They enthusiastically responded to the call of Chairman Mao, actively supporting the school in mobilizing their children to go to the countryside and mountains, and to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants. However, some parents, influenced by bourgeois ideology and the old educational system, still wanted their children to continue their studies or work in the city.

The workers and military Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team analyzed these issues and believed that to ensure that students from urban families happily go to the countryside, it was necessary to do thorough political and ideological work among the students' parents, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

Thus, the propaganda team, together with revolutionary teachers, formed twelve small groups. They went out of the school, into offices and neighborhoods, and during holidays and spare time, held study classes for revolutionary parents in different areas. In these classes, they used Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. They studied one quote from Chairman Mao, criticized one of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies, and cleansed one aspect of their own minds of poison. They combined studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Everyone said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We Communists are like seeds, and we must scatter ourselves all over the country and take root in the soil.' But Liu Shaoqi spreads the 'theory of reading books to become officials,' wanting our children to become masters riding on the backs of the people. The evil purpose of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi is to turn the younger generation into tools for his capitalist restoration. We will not be deceived." They also discussed the question of how to truly love and care for their children. Many parents said: Chairman Mao teaches the youth to grow in the great winds and waves of revolution into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. This is the greatest care and love for the youth. They unanimously agreed to actively mobilize their children to go to the countryside and receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants.

The propaganda team also frequently invited parents to the school to hold meetings and participate in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation activities. These activities helped revolutionary parents deeply understand that sending youth to the countryside and mountains is the fundamental way for youth to achieve ideological transformation and cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Some parents originally thought that their children were revolutionary rebels and that the school should "consider" keeping them in the city. After participating in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation activities, they all mobilized their children to sign up to go to the countryside.

The propaganda team, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," went into the students' homes to do patient and detailed political and ideological work with the parents.

After the graduates from this school who live in the city were sent to Lingbao County in the countryside, the propaganda team organized some of the students' parents to visit there. When they saw with their own eyes the poor and lower-middle peasants hanging up portraits of Chairman Mao in the children's rooms, giving them class education, and teaching them how to make clothes and farm, they were deeply moved. They unanimously praised Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as extremely wise and correct. They excitedly said, "Handing over our children to the poor and lower-middle peasants, we are one hundred percent at ease!"

    驻洛阳十九中学的工人、解放军宣传队以毛泽东思想为指针
    认真做好家长工作动员子女下乡上山
    据新华社郑州二十六日电　驻河南省洛阳市第十九中学的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，在动员毕业生到农村去接受贫下中农再教育的过程中，以毛泽东思想为指针，认真做好学生家长的政治思想工作，使他们协助学校动员自己的子女愉快地到农村安家落户。
    洛阳市第十九中学百分之八十以上的学生都是城市干部和城市居民的子女。学生家长经过两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，通过活学活用毛泽东思想，狠批刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，认清了旧学校、旧教育制度对青年一代的毒害。他们热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，积极协助学校动员自己的子女下乡上山，走与工农相结合的道路。但是，也有部分学生家长，由于受资产阶级思想和旧教育制度的影响，总想让自己的子女升学或留在城市里工作。
    工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志分析了这些活思想，认为要使家在城市的毕业生愉快地到农村去，就必须切实做好学生家长的政治思想工作，用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑。
    于是，宣传队和革命教师一起，组成了十二个小组，走出校门，深入机关和街道，利用假日和业余时间，分片举办了革命家长毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线。他们学习一条毛主席语录，批判刘少奇一个反动谬论，在自己思想上肃清一个方面的流毒，把活学活用毛泽东思想和斗私批修紧紧结合起来。大家说，毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”；而刘少奇却大肆散播“读书做官论”，要我们的孩子成为骑在人民头上的老爷。大叛徒刘少奇的罪恶目的，就是要把年青一代变成他复辟资本主义的工具，我们决不上当。大家还讨论了究竟怎样才算爱护孩子这样一个问题。不少家长都说：毛主席教导青年人要在革命的大风大浪里，锻炼成长为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，这是对知识青年的最大关怀，最大爱护。他们一致表示，要积极动员自己的子女到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育。
    宣传队还不断把学生家长请到学校来，举行座谈会，让他们参加学校的斗、批、改活动。这些活动，使革命家长深刻认识到，知识青年下乡上山是知识青年实现思想革命化，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本途径。有些家长原来认为自己的孩子是革命造反派，家庭出身又好，学校应该“照顾”留在城市。参加学校的斗、批、改活动以后，纷纷动员自己的子女报名下乡。
    宣传队遵照伟大领袖毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，深入学生家庭，对家长进行耐心细致的政治思想工作。
    这个学校家住城市的毕业生下放到灵宝县农村以后，宣传队还组织一部分学生家长到那里去参观访问。当他们亲眼看到贫下中农在孩子们的住室张贴着伟大领袖毛主席像，对孩子们进行阶级教育，手把手地教孩子们做衣服、种地的情景后，很受感动，一致赞颂毛主席的革命路线无比英明，无比正确。他们兴奋地说，把孩子交给贫下中农，我们一百个放心！
