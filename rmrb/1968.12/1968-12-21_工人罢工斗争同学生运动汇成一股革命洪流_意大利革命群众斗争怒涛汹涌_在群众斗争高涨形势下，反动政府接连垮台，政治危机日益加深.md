Workers' strike struggles and student movements have converged into a revolutionary tide. The revolutionary struggles of the Italian masses are surging forward. Amidst the high tide of mass struggles, reactionary governments have successively collapsed, and the political crisis is deepening.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 20th, the wave of strikes by Italian workers against the brutal exploitation of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and in defense of their own immediate rights continues to rise. The struggle of Italian students against the rotten educational system and the government's suppression of the student movement is also advancing. The struggles of workers and students have merged into a revolutionary tide, fiercely assaulting the reactionary rule of the Italian monopolistic capitalist clique.

Recently, more than a million metal and machinery workers and 900,000 textile and garment workers in Italy have been staging strikes across the country in rotation, demanding wage increases.

In the Lazio region's Rieti Province and Rieti City, workers staged a general strike on the 18th, demanding wage increases and full employment.

In the northern Italian province of Vicenza, the factories belonging to the "Mazzotto" textile company were paralyzed by a strike on the 18th.

The Italian student movement is currently surging forward in a magnificent manner.

In the Italian capital Rome, more than 60,000 students staged another class boycott on the 20th, expressing strong opposition to the rotten educational system and the reactionary policies of the Italian government. Students also held a massive demonstration, causing traffic in the city center to come to a halt.

Across Italy, more and more middle school students are taking action, joining university students and workers in the struggle.

In the central Italian region of Tuscany, in Livorno, after the police used force to drive out students who had occupied the Industrial Institute, the middle school students of Livorno occupied all the city's middle schools on the 18th to support the struggle of the Industrial Institute students and to protest against police brutality. The students also reoccupied the Industrial Institute. The port workers of Livorno also stopped work for half an hour to support the students' just struggle.

In Viareggio, north of Livorno, all middle schools were occupied by students on the 16th.

Inspired by the unprecedented surge in mass movements, even elementary school students in Italy have risen up to join the struggle.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 18th, under the situation of intensifying class contradictions and surging mass struggles at home, the Italian monopolistic bourgeoisie had to change horses midway again, patching together a new government composed of the Christian Democratic Party, the Unified Socialist Party, and the Republican Party. Since this year, as the political and economic crisis has deepened, Italy's political situation has been in turmoil for a long time. Under the impact of the unprecedented surge in the student movement and the workers' movement, the government headed by Aldo Moro collapsed in early June, and the "transitional" government headed by Giovanni Leone was forced to resign on November 19. Before this new government was formed, Italy had been in a state of no government for more than three weeks.
