The revolutionary workers of China's largest New Anjiang Hydropower Station have earnestly implemented the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Using the revolutionary criticism campaign as a driving force, they have effectively promoted the development of the revolution and production, and the entire station has completed the state's annual power generation plan ahead of schedule and in excess of the target.

Through deepening the revolutionary criticism campaign, the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines of the workers at the New Anjiang Hydropower Station have significantly heightened their awareness. They have carried out a thorough clean-up of the class ranks, launching wave after wave of fierce attacks against class enemies, and have unearthed a handful of class enemies hiding within the revolutionary ranks.

The revolutionary upsurge has driven the production upsurge. Since autumn this year, New Anjiang has encountered a historically rare low water level, and the demand for electricity has been greater than in any previous year since the station's establishment. However, the hydropower workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless and dauntless. They have launched a campaign to fight against the drought and ensure the electricity needs for industrial and agricultural production. On one hand, they have extensively promoted campaigns to save water and electricity, and on the other hand, they have carried out technical innovations and technological revolutions, using methods such as artificial rainmaking and increasing water intake. Additionally, they have designed and installed a 700-meter-long overhead pipeline and water pump on their own, which has played a significant role in generating and supplying more electricity. Under the joint efforts of the revolutionary workers, they have finally overcome the difficulties of low water levels and high loads, completing the state's annual power generation plan ahead of schedule and in excess of the target for another year. They have also created a new record for power generation and accident-free operation during the dry season since the station's establishment.

    新安江水力发电厂大批判推动生产发展
    我国最大的新安江水力发电厂革命职工，认真落实党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，以革命大批判为动力，有力地促进了革命和生产的发展，全厂已提前超额完成全年国家发电量计划。
    新安江水电厂革命职工通过深入开展革命大批判，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，他们深入开展了清理阶级队伍的工作，向阶级敌人发动了一次又一次的猛烈进攻，深挖出混在革命队伍中的一小撮阶级敌人。
    革命高潮促进了生产高潮。今年入秋以来，新安江碰到了历史上少有的低水位，电力负荷的需要量比建厂以来任何一年都多。但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的水电工人，天不怕，地不怕，掀起了同枯水作斗争，确保工农业生产用电需要的热潮。他们一方面广泛开展节约用水、用电运动，另一方面大搞技术革新和技术革命，采用人工降雨、增加入库水量等办法，另外还自行设计和安装了一条长达七百多米的架空管路和水泵，对发电机组多发电多供电起了很大作用。在革命职工的共同努力下，终于战胜了水位低、负荷大的困难，今年再次提前和超额完成了今年国家发电量计划，并且创造了建厂以来枯水期发电和无事故运行的新纪录。
