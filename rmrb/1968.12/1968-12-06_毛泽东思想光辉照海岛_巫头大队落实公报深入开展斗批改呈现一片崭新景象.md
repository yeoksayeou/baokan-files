The East is red, the sun is rising. The sun is Mao Zedong. Under the radiant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the frontier island of Wutou Island in Dongxing County of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, located at the western end of the northern Gulf of Tonkin, has undergone a revolutionary transformation through the stormy battles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The island is now vibrant with revolutionary spirit. The people of the Jing and Han ethnic groups are filled with enthusiasm, and in the battle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are composing stirring songs of triumph with Mao Zedong Thought.

    Long-term planning starts from the basics
    In the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wutou Brigade, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have taken the stage of managing schools and become the new masters of educational power.

    Long-term planning starts from the basics. After the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wutou Brigade took control of educational power, they followed the guidance of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué and focused on establishing proletarian political leadership in schools, walking the glorious path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, making class struggle the main course and emphasizing class struggle in everything. Next to the primary school, there is a large banyan tree. This was the site where the reactionary Kuomintang, landlords, and fishery tyrants slaughtered laboring people before liberation. Under this banyan tree, how much blood of the poor people was shed! Following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, "If you do not understand what class is, if you do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution," they used the large banyan tree as a living textbook for class education. Brigade Party Secretary Yuan Chengzhu led more than a hundred teachers and students to the tree, pointing to the banyan tree and denouncing the tragic scenes of how the landlords and fishery tyrants cruelly killed dozens of poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone was indignant and raised their fists, shouting, "Never forget the bitterness of class struggle, always remember the blood debt!" "Down with the landlord class!" "Down with the fishery tyrants!" "Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!" Through class education, seeds of class hatred were planted in the young hearts of the children, cultivating a loyal heart for Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants also made a wooden sign with the words "Tears and Grievances Under the Big Tree" and nailed it to the tree, educating everyone to never forget class struggle.

    After coming out of the study class
    Chairman Mao said, "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." Wutou Brigade, through holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum to every household, implementing them in everyone's actions.

    The fourth production team has a woman named Liu Si Ma. After attending the Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the production team, she thought: Now, every household has set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and everyone is striving to be a revolutionary warrior who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Although our family only has the two of us, we cannot fall behind! One evening, during dinner, she discussed setting up a family study class with her husband, Liu Si Gong. Unexpectedly, as soon as she opened her mouth, Liu Si Gong retorted, saying, "We are about to go into the coffin, what is there to study? If you want to study, you go, I will do my work."

    Liu Si Ma was not discouraged by the setback. She understood that her husband's reluctance to study was mainly because he had forgotten the class bitterness of the past. Liu Si Ma patiently conducted class education for him, arousing his class feelings of infinite love for Chairman Mao. Liu Si Gong is a poor old fisherman. At the age of three, the evil old society took away his father's life, and his mother was forced to remarry, leaving him alone and helpless. He started working for the fishery tyrants at a very young age, drifting across the sea, traveling and toiling, but in the end, he still could not fill his stomach or cover his body. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that rescued Liu Si Gong from his miserable life. Thinking of the past and looking at the present, he could not help but shed tears, his heart unsettled for a long time. He said, "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no great reversal of fortune for us poor people. Chairman Mao is our great savior, his kindness is as high as the mountains and as deep as the sea. Chairman Mao's books are written for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Not reading Chairman Mao's books and not listening to Chairman Mao's words is the greatest act of forgetting one's roots." Liu Si Gong's consciousness was raised, and his feelings changed. That night, it was already deep into the night, but in the room of the old couple, the sound of studying Chairman Mao's works could still be heard. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the communiqué as weapons to fiercely criticize and denounce the revisionist trash promoted by Liu Shaoqi, such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "self-reliance, self-management, self-sufficiency," and the "four freedoms." Liu Si Gong was a famous pearl picker, and every time he went out to sea, he never returned empty-handed. But he never gave the pearls to the collective, and a pile of pearl shells accumulated at his doorstep. This time, during the couple's criticism meeting, he pointed to the pile of pearl shells and said with hatred, "This is the harm Liu Shaoqi did to me. This guy who deserves to die a thousand times is trying to restore capitalism and make us suffer twice the hardship. This road must not be taken." Liu Si Ma also said, "Following Chairman Mao is the path to brightness. Following Liu Shaoqi is a dead end. The bright path of socialism, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely take it. Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism is a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible!" The couple criticized more fiercely and more harshly, denouncing Liu Shaoqi's various reactionary fallacies until they were rotten and stinking. Liu Si Gong is already over seventy years old, but under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, he is becoming younger and younger. Now he weaves fishing nets for the collective every day, picks up cow dung, and when he sees weeds in the collective's red soil fields, he voluntarily goes to weed and cultivate the soil. He said, "The more effort I put into the collective, the more loyal I am to Chairman Mao." The community members praised him for learning well and using it actively, and evaluated the couple as "a red family." But he said, "This is all the result of Old Four Ma helping me to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively."

    The new Yu Gong on the island
    The great struggle, criticism, and transformation movement smashed all old rules, customs, and habits that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, greatly liberated the productive forces in the countryside, and promoted the rapid development of production. Wutou Brigade has produced many new Yu Gongs who conquer the island, becoming a model for the entire Zhuang Autonomous Region. Revolutionary masses come to visit and learn from here in an endless stream.

    In the struggle to change the sky and earth and conquer nature on Wutou Island, the poor peasant and old fisherman He Jinghua led the fishermen and militiamen to the sea, opening up thirty-four fishing ports, expanding the fishing area by twenty-five million mu, and achieving a bumper harvest in fishing. He was praised by the people as the new Yu Gong with inventions and creations on the island.

    To increase the fishing yield on Wutou Island, it is necessary to carry out technological reforms in fishing. However, some people thought, "Fishing is a skill on the water, you can't see the bottom, you can't touch the bottom, you can only rely on luck, what technology can be reformed?" Old fisherman He Jinghua broke this superstition and said, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created.'" Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, he thought of ways to improve technology and reform fishing methods. Every time he encountered difficulties, he would open Chairman Mao's works to find the direction. Once, he came up with a technical reform plan for net fishing and immediately went to find Party Secretary Yuan Chengzhu. Yuan Chengzhu strongly supported him, and the two immediately went out to sea to experiment. The result was successful. Previously, it was only possible to net fish in five-foot-deep waters, but now it is possible to net fish in twenty-foot-deep seas. One evening, he took a few fishermen to a bay to try the new fishing method, fishing in deep water and rapid currents. At the beginning, some fishermen doubted it, thinking that since the beginning of the world, no one had seen fishing in such a place, and if it went wrong, the net would be ruined and the fish would not even be smelled. But he was determined to take the road that no one had taken before and create miracles that no one had created before. The result was a catch of 39,000 pounds of fish in one net, while the highest yield of the old net was only 7,000 to 8,000 pounds. The new net fishing method was finally successful. The fishermen, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stood on the deck in front of Chairman Mao's giant portrait, shouting excitedly, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

    After creating these advanced experiences, the Party branch of Wutou Brigade, following Chairman Mao's instructions, "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and make progress," systematically summarized the experiences and ensured that the fishing yield continued to soar. In 1957, the total fish yield of the entire brigade was only 182,000 pounds; in 1962, it developed to 261,000 pounds, and this year it leaped to 800,000 pounds, with an average of 800 pounds of fish produced for the state per person.

    Chairman Mao said, "The people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history." The people of Wutou Island, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have conquered the sea and transformed nature. They learn from the people of Dazhai, walk the path of Dazhai, rely on their own efforts, and strive hard to march towards the barren sands, changing the backward appearance of "poverty and blankness" with the spirit of the old Yu Gong. They turned this floating sand beach, which was once considered to have no grass in spring and no grain in autumn, into a granary in one leap. From then on, Wutou Island shed the hat of relying on external aid and wrote a new chapter of self-sufficiency in grain in its history.

    毛泽东思想光辉照海岛
    巫头大队落实公报深入开展斗批改呈现一片崭新景象
    东方红，太阳升，太阳就是毛泽东。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，祖国南疆北部湾西端前哨的海岛——广西东兴各族自治县巫头大队的巫头岛，经过这场无产阶级文化大革命急风暴雨的战斗洗礼，呈现一派生气勃勃的革命新景象。海岛上京、汉族人民豪情满怀，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，用毛泽东思想谱写着一曲曲激动人心的壮丽凯歌。
        百年大计抓起点
    在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，巫头大队的贫下中农遵照毛主席的教导，登上了管理学校的政治舞台，成为掌握教育大权的新主人。
    百年大计抓起点。巫头大队贫下中农掌握了教育大权后，在党的八届十二中全会公报的指引下，他们把的是无产阶级政治建校的关，走的是“抗大”式的光荣道路。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把阶级斗争作为主课，处处事事讲阶级。小学旁边，有一棵大榕树，这是解放前国民党反动派、地主和渔霸残杀劳动人民的场所。大榕树下不知洒下了多少贫苦人民的鲜血啊！他们遵照林副主席的指示“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命”，把大榕树作为阶级教育的活教材。大队党支部书记阮成珠带领一百多个师生来到树旁，指着这棵大榕树控诉旧社会地主、渔霸在这里残酷打死了几十个贫下中农的悲惨情景时，大家都气愤地振臂高呼：“不忘阶级苦，永记血泪仇！”“打倒地主阶级！”“打倒渔霸！”“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”通过阶级教育，在孩子们幼小的心灵里播下了阶级仇恨的种子，培养了热爱毛主席的赤胆忠心。贫下中农还做了一块木牌，上面写着“大树根下泪和仇”七个大字，把它钉在树身上，教育大家千万不要忘记阶级斗争。
        从学习班出来之后
    毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”巫头大队通过举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把毛主席的最新指示和十二中全会公报传遍家家户户，落实到每个人的行动中去。
    第四生产队有个刘四妈。她参加生产队里举办的毛泽东思想学习班回来以后就想：现在，家家户户都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，人人争做无限忠于毛主席的革命战士，我们家虽然只有老两口，但也不能掉队啊！一天晚上，老两口吃饭时，她就把办家庭学习班的事跟丈夫刘四公商量。没想到一开口刘四公就把她顶了回去。说什么“快要进棺材的人了，还学什么。要学你去吧，我干我的活”。
    刘四妈碰了钉子不泄气。她懂得老头子不愿学习，主要是忘记了过去的阶级苦。刘四妈耐心地对他进行阶级教育，激发他无限热爱毛主席的阶级感情。刘四公是一个贫苦的老渔民，三岁时，万恶的旧社会就夺去了他父亲的生命，母亲后来被迫改嫁，丢下他一个人孤苦伶丁，很小就去给渔霸卖命度日，飘洋过海，奔波劳累，到头来还是食不饱肚，衣不遮体。是毛主席、共产党把刘四公从苦难生活中解救出来。他想想过去，看看今天，不住地流下泪来，心情久久不能平静。他说：“没有毛主席就没有我们穷苦人民的大翻身。毛主席是我们穷人的大救星，毛主席的恩情比山高比海深。毛主席的书是为我们贫下中农写的，不读毛主席的书，不听毛主席的话，就是最大的忘本。”刘四公认识提高了，感情就不一样。这天晚上已是更深人静，可是在老两口的房里，还传出一句句学习毛主席著作的声音。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想和“公报”为武器，狠批猛批刘少奇所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货。刘四公是很出名的拾珍珠能手，每次出海都没有空过手回来。但他过去拾的珍珠从不给集体，家门口积了一堆珍珠蚌壳。这次老两口开批判会，他指着这堆珍珠蚌壳憎恨地说：“这就是刘少奇对我的毒害，这个罪该万死的家伙，妄图复辟资本主义，要我们吃二遍苦受二遍难，这条路千万走不得。”刘四妈也说：“跟毛主席走，就是光明大道。跟刘少奇走，就是死路一条。社会主义的光明大道，我们贫下中农走定了，刘少奇妄图复辟资本主义，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！”老两口越批越猛，越批越狠，把刘少奇的各种反动谬论批得又臭又透。刘四公今年已经七十多岁了，但他在毛泽东思想的哺育下，越活越年轻。现在他每天都为集体织鱼网，拾牛粪。看到生产队的红茹地有杂草，就主动去锄草培土。他说：“多为集体出一分力，就多一分对毛主席的忠心。”社员都称赞他学得好用得活，评他老两口是“全家红”。但他说：“这都是老四妈帮助我活学活用毛泽东思想的结果。”
        海岛上的新愚公
    伟大的斗批改运动，砸碎了一切不符合毛泽东思想的旧规矩、旧风俗和旧习惯，大大地解放了农村的生产力，促进了生产的迅速发展。巫头大队出现了许许多多征服海岛的新愚公，已成为全壮族自治区学习的榜样，来这里参观学习的革命群众络绎不绝。
    在巫头岛开展改天换地征服大自然的斗争中，贫农出身的老渔民何景华带领渔民和民兵到海面去，开辟了三十四个塞网海埠，扩大了二十五万亩塞网捕鱼面积，夺取了渔业大丰收，他被人们誉为海岛上有发明创造的新愚公。
    在巫头岛要提高捕鱼产量，必须开展渔业技术改革。但是有的人认为：“捕鱼是水上功夫，看不见底，摸不到底，只有碰‘运气’，有什么技术好改革的？”老渔民何景华打破了这种迷信思想，他说：毛主席教导我们：“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”根据毛主席的教导，他想方设法提高技术，改革捕鱼的方法。每当碰到了困难，他就打开毛主席著作找方向。一次，他想出了一个接网捕鱼的技术改革方案，就立即去找党支书阮成珠同志。阮成珠同志大力支持他，俩人马上出海去试验，结果试验成功，过去只能在五尺深的海面塞网捕鱼，现在能够在二丈深的海洋塞网捕鱼。一天晚上，他带着几个渔民来到一处海湾试行新式捕鱼法，要在深水急流中塞网捕鱼。开始有的渔民怀疑，认为开天辟地到现在都没有见过在这样的地方能捕鱼，弄不好网被搞烂，鱼味都闻不到。但是他决心要走前人没有走过的道路，创造前人没有创过的奇迹。结果一网捕鱼三万九千多斤，而过去捕鱼的网产量最高才七、八千斤。新式接网捕鱼终于试验成功了。渔民们拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》群情激昂地站在船头毛主席的巨幅画像前，一次又一次地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    创造这些先进经验之后，巫头大队党支部又遵照毛主席的教导：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”，系统地总结经验，保证了捕鱼产量不断飞跃。一九五七年，全大队的鱼产只有十八万二千多斤；一九六二年发展到二十六万一千多斤，今年一跃而为八十万斤，平均每人为国家产鱼八百斤。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”巫头岛的人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，征服了大海，改造了大自然。他们学大寨人，走大寨路，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，向荒沙进军，以老愚公的精神改变“一穷二白”的落后面貌，使这个历来被人们认为春不长草，秋不结粮的浮沙海滩，一跃而变成米粮仓。从此，巫头岛甩掉了依靠外援的帽子，在自己的历史上，写下了粮食自给的新篇章。　高举红
