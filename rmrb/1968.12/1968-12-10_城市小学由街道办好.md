We believe that it is better for primary schools in cities to be managed by street offices. The reasons are as follows:

	(1) Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian education revolution clearly state: "Worker propaganda teams should stay in schools for the long term, participate in all tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and always lead the schools." As long as we seriously implement Chairman Mao's instructions, we can ensure that the leadership of the schools is in the hands of the working class. The advantages suggested by those who propose that factories should manage primary schools can also be realized under the leadership of worker propaganda teams.

	(2) The production brigades in rural areas are relatively independent units in terms of politics, economy, culture, production, and consumption, but factories are not. We cannot infer that primary schools in cities should be managed by factories just because rural primary schools are managed by production brigades. "The working class must lead everything" does not mean that everything should be managed by factories. According to this logic, wouldn't all other industries have to be managed by factories?

	(3) Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive points out: "Students should also be like this, with learning as the main focus, but also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie." If rural primary schools are managed by production brigades and urban primary schools are managed by factories, it is easy to develop a bias towards learning agriculture in rural areas and learning industry in urban areas.

	In view of the above reasons, we believe that it is better for primary schools in cities to be managed by street offices. The advantages are: students are allocated to schools and classes based on their residential areas, and the revolutionary committees of street offices manage them, which can closely link teachers and students, teachers and parents, and students and parents, and link school education with social education, which is beneficial for the all-round development of children. At the same time, teachers are placed under the supervision and education of students' parents, which is more conducive to the thought revolution and improving teaching quality. In addition, retired workers from street offices can serve as part-time teachers for schools, which is beneficial for changing the class composition of the teaching staff.

    城市小学由街道办好
    我们认为，城市小学由街道办较好。理由如下：
      （一）毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示明确指出：“工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。”只要认真落实毛主席的这一指示，就能确保学校的领导权掌握在工人阶级手中。那些建议工厂办小学所提出的各条优越性，由工人宣传队领导同样可以体现出来。
      （二）农村的生产大队是一种政治、经济、文化、生产、消费都比较独立的单位，工厂则不然。不能因农村小学由大队来办，就类推为城市小学也由工厂来办。“工人阶级必须领导一切”不等于什么都由工厂来办，照这种逻辑，岂不是除工厂以外的各行各业都要由工厂来办了吗？
      （三）毛主席的“五·七”指示指出：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。”如果农村小学由大队来办，城市小学由工厂来办，很容易发生农村以学农为主，城市以学工为主的偏向。
    鉴于上述理由，我们觉得城市小学由街道来办好。好处是：学生按居住区域分配学校和编班，由街道革委会来办，就可以把师生之间、教师与家长、学生与家长密切地联系起来，把学校教育和社会教育联系起来，对于儿童的全面发展有好处。同时，教师置于学生家长的监督和教育之下，更有利于思想革命化和提高教学质量。另外，街道的退休工人可以作为学校的兼职教师，这样对改变教师队伍的阶级成份有好处。
