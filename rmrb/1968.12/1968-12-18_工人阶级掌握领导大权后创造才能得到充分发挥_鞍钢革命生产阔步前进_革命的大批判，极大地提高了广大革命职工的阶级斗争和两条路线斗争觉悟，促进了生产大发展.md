Workers' Class Seizes Leadership to Fully Unleash Creativity

Anshan Steel's Revolutionary Production Advances by Leaps and Bounds

Revolutionary Criticism Greatly Enhances the Class Struggle and Two-Line Struggle Consciousness of Revolutionary Workers, Promoting Major Production Developments

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12 - The revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and in the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, they are deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. This has greatly enhanced their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, promoting major production developments.

Since this year, the revolutionary and production situation at Anshan Steel has been getting better and better. In the first half of the year, the production and quality of various main products have significantly improved. In the second half of the year, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions that "the working class is the leading class" and "the working class must lead everything," and after sending a part of the workers to take up leadership positions in the superstructure to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, the revolutionary workers have bravely taken on the double burden of revolution and production, achieving new successes in the production of steel, iron, steel products, metallurgical coke, and iron concentrate. Since entering November, under the inspiration of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers has soared even higher, leading to further developments in production. Since this year, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel have broken historical high-production records over 300 times, implemented more than 1,100 technical innovations and technological revolutions, including over 400 major innovations, and successfully developed many new products. Just in the rolling steel system, 753 new products have been successfully developed.

The good situation of revolutionary and production advances at Anshan Steel is the result of Mao Zedong Thought being widely propagated in Anshan during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fruitful results of the working class seizing leadership in production and technology, and vigorously implementing Chairman Mao's personally approved "Anshan Constitution." For a long time, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anshan have fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's personally approved "Anshan Constitution," vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "expert management" and "material incentives," and implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the working class. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers seized back the production and technical powers that had been usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities." They used Chairman Mao's personally approved "Anshan Constitution" as a weapon to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, greatly enhancing their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. The creative abilities of the working class have been fully unleashed. They have vigorously carried out technical innovations and technological revolutions, creating many new processes, technologies, and achievements, and making great contributions in the struggle for revolution and the promotion of production. Recently, the revolutionary workers of the Metallurgical Furnace Repair Factory at Anshan Steel, while ensuring the quality of furnace repairs, completed the repair and hot repair of three open-hearth furnaces and two open-hearth furnaces in just over ten days, achieving unprecedented outstanding results.

Since this year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel have, through revolutionary criticism, demolished many unreasonable regulations and systems. Currently, the spirit of communist cooperation is flourishing throughout the company, with mutual support and assistance between different trades, shifts, and factories, and a trend of taking on difficulties and giving way to convenience has emerged.

Currently, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel, with high spirits, are comprehensively launching a new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation. While striving for dual victories in revolution and production this year, they are actively preparing, in terms of ideology, organization, technology, and material, to achieve new successes in revolution and production next year.

    工人阶级掌握领导大权后创造才能得到充分发挥
    鞍钢革命生产阔步前进
    革命的大批判，极大地提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了生产大发展
    据新华社沈阳十二日电　鞍山钢铁公司广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中深入持久地开展革命大批判，极大地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了生产的大发展。
    今年以来，鞍钢革命和生产形势越来越好。上半年各种主要产品的产量、质量都有很大提高。下半年，在毛主席“工人阶级是领导阶级”“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示鼓舞下，在派出一部分工人进驻上层建筑领域领导斗、批、改之后，广大革命职工勇挑革命、生产两副重担，又夺得了钢、铁、钢材、冶金焦、铁精矿等主要产品的产量大幅度上升的新成就。进入十一月以来，广大革命职工在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，革命积极性更加高涨，使生产又获得了新的发展。今年以来，鞍钢广大革命职工刷新历史高产纪录三百多项，实现各种技术革新、技术革命一千一百多项，其中重大革新四百多项，并试制成功了许多新产品，仅轧钢系统试制成功的新产品就有七百五十三种。
    鞍钢革命、生产阔步前进的大好形势，是无产阶级文化大革命中毛泽东思想在鞍山得到空前大普及的结果，是工人阶级掌握生产、技术等领导大权，大力贯彻执行毛主席亲自批示的“鞍钢宪法”的丰硕成果。长期以来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在鞍山的代理人，疯狂反对毛主席亲自批示的“鞍钢宪法”，大肆推行“专家治厂”“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政。无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工夺回了被一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”所篡夺去的生产、技术大权。他们以毛主席亲自批示的“鞍钢宪法”为武器，深入持久地对刘少奇的反革命修正主义办企业路线开展了革命的大批判，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。工人阶级的创造才能得到了充分发挥，他们大闹技术革新、技术革命，创造了许多新工艺、新技术、新成就，在抓革命、促生产中作出了巨大贡献。鞍钢冶金炉修理厂革命职工，最近在保证修炉质量的前提下，仅用十几天时间就完成了三座平炉修理和两座平炉热修任务，创造了空前的优异成绩。
    今年以来，鞍钢广大革命职工在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，通过革命大批判，摧毁了许多不合理的规章制度。目前全公司共产主义协作风气得到大发扬，工种之间、班与班之间、厂与厂之间互相支援，互相抢困难、让方便，已蔚然成风。
    目前，鞍钢广大革命职工正以昂扬的斗志，全面掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，在夺取今年革命、生产双胜利的同时，从思想上、组织上、技术上、物质上积极为夺取明年革命和生产的新成就做好准备。（附图片）
