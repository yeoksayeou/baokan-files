On the day when the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on "sending educated youth to the countryside to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants is very necessary. We must persuade cadres in cities and other people to send their children who have graduated from junior high school, senior high school, and college to the countryside. Mobilize them. The comrades in the countryside should welcome them" was issued, we interviewed Deputy Director Wang Leting of the Civil Aviation Zhanjiang Airport. Wang Leting enthusiastically hailed the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and spoke at length about his experience of sending his son to the countryside to settle down five years ago and his daughter-in-law to the countryside to settle down more than a year ago. He said: Revolutionary cadres must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and send their children to the countryside.

Wang Leting has only one son, Wang Yanhui, who came to the city from a village in Shandong at the age of five with his mother. In the summer of 1963, after graduating from junior high school, he spent the entire vacation at home with nothing to do. Wang Leting, who comes from a poor peasant family, and his wife looked at their son and felt uncomfortable. Yanhui's mother recalled the situation when they were in the countryside before: "When our child was young, living in the countryside, I went to collect firewood, and he helped pick up twigs; I carried a basket to collect manure, and he also helped pick up manure balls. Now it's good, he has nothing to do all day. This can't go on." Wang Leting added: "That's right, our family has been farmers for generations, and the children of farmers should look like laboring people. Now he is like this, it makes people uneasy!"

Chairman Mao's brilliant directive on sending educated youth to the mountains and countryside illuminated the hearts of Wang Leting and his wife. They decided to respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, sending their son to the countryside to settle down and reform his thoughts. When Yanhui heard that his parents wanted to send him to the countryside, he said: "Dad, you only have me as your son. Why do you have to send me to the countryside?" Wang Leting patiently educated his son, saying: "Child, Chairman Mao led us poor and lower-middle peasants to stand up. We must not forget our roots. Where do you get your food and clothes from? They are all given by workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. The people have raised you for sixteen years, you must serve the people and be the successors of the revolutionary cause!"

From then on, the couple studied and applied the "Three Articles" with their son, explaining the great significance of sending educated youth to the mountains and countryside in preventing and countering revisionism. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, after repeated education, in October 1963, Wang Yanhui took the road of integrating with workers and peasants and went to Yangjiang, 480 miles away from Zhanjiang, to be a farmer.

The following summer, Wang Yanhui returned home for a visit, and he was completely different from before. He had developed the habit of labor in the farm, and even at home, he couldn't sit still. One day, he went to help maintain a car, and someone said to him: "Little Wang, you studied for more than ten years and now you're rolling in the mud, isn't that a waste of talent? You should come back." Yanhui said, "That's not possible!" But in his mind, he wavered. When he returned home, he told his father, "Dad, let me learn to drive!" Wang Leting heard this and immediately realized that the child still had the wrong idea of fearing hardship and not wanting to leave the city.

Following Vice Chairman Lin's directive that "if you don't understand what class is, don't understand what exploitation is, then you don't understand revolution," the couple decided to give the child another class education. After dinner, the family sat in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and held a family meeting, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. Wang Leting recalled the bitter history of his ancestors being forced to work for landlords and suffering oppression and exploitation. When talking about the famine in Shandong in 1942, when landlords demanded rent, the family ate tree bark and grass roots, and almost starved to death, Wang Leting told the child, "Chairman Mao saved us, we must not forget our roots after we are better off!" Little Wang, with tears in his eyes, said, "I will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and walk the path indicated by Chairman Mao!"

The next day, Wang Yanhui happily returned to the farm. From then on, he studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, learned from the workers in the farm in labor, and strictly demanded of himself. The summer in Guangdong is scorching. The sharp sugarcane leaves cut his hands; the sweat flowing down stung like needles, but he never complained. In a letter to his father, he wrote: "The more sweat I shed, the closer my heart is to the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Wang Yanhui made rapid progress in the countryside. Wang Leting and his wife received a letter from their son, seeing the child grow up under the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought, they were overjoyed. But the couple still had one thing on their minds: their newly married daughter-in-law, Chen Yuyan, was still living in the city, eating idly. They planned to send their daughter-in-law to the countryside to settle down and let her grow through labor.

Last October, Wang Yanhui returned home for a visit. Wang Leting and his wife seized this opportunity to persuade Yuyan to go to the countryside. Thus, the family studied Chairman Mao's works together, discussed the great significance of sending educated youth to the countryside to settle down, and severely criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of studying to be an official." Wang Leting said: "Whether the children of urban cadres go to the countryside or rely on their parents who are cadres to live an idle life, this is a matter of executing which line and walking which path. Chairman Mao has pointed out a bright path of thought revolutionization for educated youth, and we hope that Yuyan can also firmly walk this path." Yanhui's mother also actively persuaded her daughter-in-law to go to the countryside. Wang Yanhui, combining his own experience of labor training in the countryside, also did work with his wife. After studying, Chen Yuyan's thoughts were clear, and she expressed her determination to respond to Chairman Mao's call and go to the countryside to settle down.

To do a good job of persuading the in-laws, Yanhui's mother took her son and daughter-in-law to Zhanjiang Harbor, where they studied Chairman Mao's directive on sending educated youth to the mountains and countryside with Yuyan's parents. Chen Yuyan's father, old worker Chen, heard this and said, "Going to the countryside is the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao. We workers listen to Chairman Mao the most, and we fully agree that Yuyan should go to the countryside to settle down."

With the firm support of the revolutionary family, Chen Yuyan also went to the countryside to settle down. After more than a year of labor training, she learned the main farm work in the countryside and was no longer an idle eater.

    送子下乡安家落户记
    ——访民航湛江航空站副站长王乐亭
    在伟大领袖毛主席“知识青年到农村去，接受贫下中农的再教育，很有必要。要说服城里干部和其他人，把自己初中、高中、大学毕业的子女，送到乡下去，来一个动员。各地农村的同志应当欢迎他们去”的最新指示发表的当天，我们访问了民航湛江航空站副站长王乐亭同志。王乐亭热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表，并畅谈了他送儿子下乡落户五年，又送儿媳下乡落户一年多的经过，他说：革命干部要遵照毛主席的教导，把自己的子女送到乡下去。
    王乐亭只有一个儿子，名叫王延秋，五岁时从山东农村随妈妈来到城市。一九六三年初中毕业，整个暑假住在家里，没事干。贫农出身的王乐亭老两口，看着儿子这个样，心里不是滋味。延秋的妈妈回忆起以前在农村时的情形时说：“咱孩子小时候，住在农村里，我去打柴，他帮着捡树枝；我背筐拾粪，他也帮着拾个粪蛋。现在倒好，成天没事干，这样下去可不行。”王乐亭接着说：“对呀，咱家几辈子都是庄稼人，庄稼人的孩子，该有个劳动人民的样子。现在他这样，叫人不放心！”
    毛主席关于知识青年上山下乡的光辉指示，照亮了王乐亭老两口的心。他们决定响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，送儿子下乡安家落户，改造思想。王延秋一听父母要把他送到乡下去，便说：“爸，你只有我这么一个儿子，为什么非把我送到乡下去不可？”王乐亭针对儿子的活思想，耐心地教育他说：“孩子，毛主席领导我们贫下中农翻了身，我们可不能忘本。你吃的穿的，是那里来的？都是工人、贫下中农给的。人民把你养了十六年，你要为人民服务，做革命事业的接班人啊！”
    从此，老两口同儿子一起活学活用“老三篇”，讲知识青年上山下乡对防修反修的重大意义。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，经过反复教育，一九六三年十月，王延秋走上了与工农相结合的道路，到了离湛江四百八十里的阳江去当农民。
    第二年夏天，王延秋回家探亲，和以前大不相同了。他在农场养成了劳动习惯，在家也闲不住。一天，他去帮助维护汽车，有人对他说：“小王，你念了十来年书去滚泥巴，不是大材小用吗？还是回来吧。”王延秋嘴上说：“那可不行！”可思想上却动摇了。回到家里便对父亲说：“爸爸，让我学开车吧！”王乐亭一听，马上意识到这孩子头脑里还是有怕艰苦，不愿离开城市的错误思想。
    遵照林副主席“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命”的指示，老两口决定再对孩子进行一次阶级教育。晚饭后，一家人坐在毛主席像前，开了一个家庭会，学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导。王乐亭回忆了祖祖辈辈被迫给地主扛活，受尽压迫、剥削的苦难家史。讲到一九四二年山东闹灾荒，地主逼租，一家人啃树皮、吃草根，差点饿死的情形时，王乐亭对孩子说，毛主席救了我们，我们可不能好了疮疤忘了疼啊！小王含着热泪说：毛主席的恩情我绝不能忘，我一定听毛主席的话，走毛主席指引的路！
    第二天，王延秋高高兴兴地回到了农场，从此他刻苦地学习毛主席著作，在劳动中向农场工人学习，严格要求自己。广东的夏天，骄阳似火。锋利的甘蔗叶，划破了他的手；汗水流下来，疼得象针扎一样，但他从不叫苦。他在给爸爸的信中说：“汗水流得越多，和贫下中农的心贴得越紧。”
    王延秋在农村进步很快。王乐亭夫妇接到儿子一封信，看到孩子在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露下茁壮成长，打心眼里高兴。可老两口还有一桩心事：刚刚过门的儿媳妇陈玉燕，还住在城市吃闲饭。他们打算把儿媳也送到农村去安家落户，让她在劳动中锻炼成长。
    去年十月，王延秋回家探亲，王乐亭老两口抓住这个机会动员玉燕下乡。于是一家人一起学习毛主席著作，畅谈知识青年下乡落户的伟大意义，狠批大叛徒刘少奇的“读书做官论”。王乐亭说：“城里干部子女是到农村去，还是依靠当干部的父母，过着吃闲饭的生活，这是关系到执行什么路线，走什么道路的大事。毛主席为知识青年指出了思想革命化的光明大道，我们希望玉燕也能坚定地走这条道路。”延秋的妈也积极动员儿媳妇到农村去。王延秋结合自己在农村劳动锻炼的体会，也给爱人作工作。经过学习，陈玉燕思想通了，她表示坚决响应毛主席的号召，到农村去安家落户。
    为了做好亲家的思想工作，延秋的妈领着儿子、儿媳到湛江海港，同儿媳的父母一起学习了毛主席关于知识青年上山下乡的指示。陈玉燕的爸爸、老工人陈师傅一听，就说：“到农村去，这是毛主席指引的光明大道。我们工人最听毛主席的话，玉燕到农村去安家落户，我完全同意。”
    在革命家庭的坚决支持下，陈玉燕也到农村安家落户，经过一年多的劳动锻炼，她学会了农村的主要农活，再不是一个吃闲饭的人了。
