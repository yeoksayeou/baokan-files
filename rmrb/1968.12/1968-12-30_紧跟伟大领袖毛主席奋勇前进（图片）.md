The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Northern Suburbs Timber Factory, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left, has fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, mobilized the masses, intensified class struggle, and carried out the work of cleaning up class ranks. This has led to a tremendous leap in production, transforming a "difficult-to-manage" unit into an advanced unit. This is a scene of revolutionary workers in the factory studying the history of the struggle between the two lines and resolving to advance bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

During the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought rapidly spread among hundreds of millions of people and deeply entered their hearts. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers consciously studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in their struggles. This is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensuring that our country will never change color. The picture shows an old peasant woman from Dazhai, Han Heini, studying the "Three Articles" with young revolutionaries.

The fourth production team of Yongdian Brigade, Yondian Commune, Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, known as the "Military and Civilian Dazhai," after deeply studying Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "Sending Knowledge Youth to the Countryside," immediately wrote a letter to Chairman Mao expressing their determination. They vowed to humbly accept re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants and to root themselves in the countryside for life, becoming good revolutionary successors.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army resolutely responds to the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, seizing the revolution and promoting preparedness, further consolidating national defense, continuing to do a good job of "supporting the army and loving the people," and being ready at any time to liberate Taiwan. We must be highly vigilant against the wolf-like nature of American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist traitor clique. If the enemy dares to impose war on us, we will decisively, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them.

The Chinese working class resolutely implements Chairman Mao's great directive that "the working class must lead everything," achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including various cultural fields, and completing the tasks of each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation proposed by Chairman Mao, carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

Under the great banner of Chairman Mao's "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production," the workers of the Casting Steel Workshop of the Mechanical and Electrical Factory of Benxi Steel Company have thoroughly criticized the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the factory, such as "money as the commander" and "material incentives," these counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. The revolution is booming, and production is flourishing. Technical innovations are continuously emerging, such as the automatic control device for electric furnaces. Various high-quality steels have been produced.

With Mao Zedong Thought as their invincible weapon, the 500 million peasants in our country have, while intensifying the revolution, bravely and tenaciously fought against nature and the earth, achieving another bumper harvest in agricultural production this year on the basis of consecutive years of good harvests. This is a scene of community members in Jiaoqiao Commune, Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, spreading out new cotton.

Our Reporter

The heroic workers of Daqing, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly implement each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army supporting the left, have achieved brilliant results in both revolution and production. They have completed the state plan ahead of schedule, and the produced crude oil is being shipped out in large quantities, strongly supporting the socialist construction of the motherland and the world revolution.
