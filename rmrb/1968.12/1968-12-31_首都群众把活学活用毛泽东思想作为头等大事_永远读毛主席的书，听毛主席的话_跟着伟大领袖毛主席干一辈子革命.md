The year 1968, in which the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved great victories, saw the masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres in the capital, with the study of Chairman Mao Zedong's latest instructions as the focus, launch one wave after another of movements to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Especially after the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly stressed. It is not enough to tell only a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it," as well as the republication of Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee, the revolutionary people, in conjunction with the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, have raised the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level. Great Mao Zedong Thought has never been so widely popularized among the revolutionary people of the capital as it is today; Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Through more than two years of struggle, the revolutionary people of the capital have come to realize more deeply that revolution relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Whether they are workers, peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, cadres, students, or elderly people with white hair, or children who have just started school, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being good fighters of Chairman Mao have become conscious actions. Advanced units and activists in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought have continually emerged. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of the whole city are full of vigor and enthusiasm, their spirits are soaring, and their spiritual outlook is undergoing profound changes.

In the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, covering the entire city and countryside. Leading organs, grassroots factories and mines, rural communes, schools, shops, and streets have all set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers say: "Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding principle and source of strength. Without Mao Zedong Thought, we would have nothing!"

Revolutionary committees at all levels in the city and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the "three supports, two militaries" frontline have always placed helping and leading the revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all their work. They set an example by learning diligently, actively propagating, resolutely executing, and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary committees at all levels and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have also adopted various forms to discover and cultivate advanced individuals in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, summarize and exchange typical experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously deepen the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must focus on the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." The most important experience of the revolutionary people of the capital in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is to follow Comrade Lin Biao's instruction, take the People's Liberation Army as an example, and learn Mao Zedong Thought with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. Many units, in conjunction with the struggle situation and various tasks of their departments, have used methods such as lecturing on party history, factory history, village history, and family history, eating bitter meals, and holding class education exhibitions to conduct class education for the broad revolutionary masses, further deepening the broad revolutionary masses' boundless love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They say: Those who have experienced the darkness know the brightness of the sun, those who have suffered from the cold feel the warmth of the sun. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants who grew up in the bitter waters of the old society will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness. We will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao to revolution for life!

Mao Zedong Thought concentrates the wisdom of the masses, is higher than the wisdom of the masses, reflects practice, and is higher than practice, guiding the revolutionary people's struggle practice. The broad masses, in conjunction with the study of the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, especially the history of the two-line struggle in the more than two years of the Cultural Revolution, consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, persist in learning in struggle and using in struggle, raising the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the capital to a new level. The broad masses have deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon for carrying out the struggle between the two lines. Only by truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought can one stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint in the great storms of the struggle between the two lines and consciously defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by combining the actual struggle between the two lines to study Mao Zedong Thought can one study deeply, remember firmly, and use well, building an iron Great Wall in one's mind to prevent and combat revisionism.

The new characteristic of the revolutionary people of the capital in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is prominently reflected in the thorough criticism of the reactionary bourgeois ideology of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and other top handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Many units, in conjunction with the actual struggle between the two lines in their regions and units, and in conjunction with the settlement of the crimes of the Beijing Municipal Committee's anti-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen, have made the revolutionary criticism burn more fiercely. The thorough criticism has greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses, promoting the deep development of the work of cleaning up the class ranks and the struggle-criticism-reform.

The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has promoted a new leap in the socialist construction of the capital. Through the struggle between the two lines to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary spirit of serving the public and the collective has been greatly carried forward in the socialist construction of all fronts. A new situation of leaps and bounds has begun to appear. On the industrial front, revolutionary workers, with the high sense of responsibility of the working class as the leading class, shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, take the lead in the great revolutionary struggle of struggle-criticism-reform, and have implemented more than ten thousand technical revolution and technical innovation projects, promoting the rapid development of industrial production. By mid-December, more than 700 factories and mines in the city had completed this year's production tasks. On the agricultural front, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm, overcame the worst drought in 70 years, achieved a bumper harvest, and the grain and cotton production both exceeded that of 1967, creating the highest level in history. It can be foreseen that the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will create even greater miracles.

    首都群众把活学活用毛泽东思想作为头等大事
    永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话
    跟着伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命
    据新华社三十日讯在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的一九六八年，首都广大工农兵和革命群众以学习伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示为中心，掀起了一个接一个活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。特别是党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报、毛主席关于“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示的发表，以及毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告重新发表以后，广大革命人民结合学习党内两条路线斗争的历史，把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动提高到了一个新的水平。伟大的毛泽东思想，在首都革命人民中从来没有象今天这样大普及；毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，从来没有象今天这样深入人心。
    无产阶级文化大革命是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。通过两年多来的斗争实践，首都革命人民越来越深刻地认识到，干革命靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。无论是工人、农民、解放军指战员、干部、学生，无论是白发苍苍的老人、刚刚入学的孩子，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，已日益成为自觉的行动。活学活用毛泽东思想的先进单位和积极分子不断涌现出来。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，全市革命人民意气风发，斗志昂扬，精神面貌正发生着深刻的变化。
    在活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动中，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班有如雨后春笋，遍及全市城乡。领导机关、基层厂矿、农村社队、学校、商店和街道，都普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班。广大工农兵群众说：“毛泽东思想是我们行动的准则，力量的源泉，没有毛泽东思想，就没有我们的一切！”
    全市各级革命委员会和战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的人民解放军指战员，一直把帮助和领导好革命群众学好用好毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。他们以身作则，努力学习、积极宣传、坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想。各级革委会和人民解放军指战员还采取各种形式，发现和培养活学活用毛泽东思想的先进人物，总结和交流活学活用毛泽东思想的典型经验，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断深入发展。
    林彪副主席说：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”首都革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想一条最重要的经验，就是遵照林副主席的指示，以人民解放军为榜样，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情学习毛泽东思想。许多单位结合本部门的斗争形势和各项工作任务，采用讲党史、厂史、村史、家史，吃忆苦饭，举办阶级教育展览等形式，向广大革命群众进行阶级教育，进一步加深了广大革命群众对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无比热爱。他们说：摸过黑夜的人最知道太阳的光明，挨过冻的人最感觉太阳的温暖，在旧社会的苦水里长大的工人和贫下中农，一辈子忘不了毛主席的恩情。我们要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命！
    毛泽东思想集中了群众的智慧，又高于群众的智慧，反映了实践，又高于实践，指导着革命人民的斗争实践。广大群众结合学习党内两条路线斗争史，尤其是两年多来文化大革命中的两条路线斗争史，自觉活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持在斗争中学，在斗争中用，使首都活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动达到了新水平。广大群众深有体会地说，毛泽东思想是进行两条路线斗争的最强大的思想武器。只有把毛泽东思想真正学到手，才能在两条路线斗争的大风大浪中站稳无产阶级立场，自觉地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。也只有结合两条路线斗争的实际来学习毛泽东思想，才能学得深，记得牢，用得好，在头脑里筑起防修反修的钢铁长城。
    首都革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想的这一新特点，突出地表现在深入开展对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义思想的革命大批判中。许多单位结合本地区、本单位的两条路线斗争实际，结合清算旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团的罪行，把革命大批判的烈火烧得越来越旺。革命的大批判，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，推动了清理阶级队伍工作和斗、批、改的深入发展。
    活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，推动首都的社会主义建设出现了新的飞跃。首都革命人民通过在两条路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，一心为公、一心为集体的革命精神大大发扬，社会主义建设各条战线上新的飞跃形势已经开始出现。在工业战线上，革命职工以“工人阶级是领导阶级”的高度责任感，肩挑革命、生产两副重担，在斗、批、改的伟大革命斗争中走在最前列，并且实现了上万项技术革命和技术革新项目，推动工业生产突飞猛进地向前发展。到十二月中旬，全市已有七百多个工矿企业完成了今年的生产任务。在农业战线上，广大贫下中农紧紧依靠毛泽东思想，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，以冲天革命干劲，战胜了七十年来未有的大旱，获得了大丰收，粮棉产量都超过一九六七年，创造了历史最高水平。可以预见，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民群众，必将创造出更大的人间奇迹。
