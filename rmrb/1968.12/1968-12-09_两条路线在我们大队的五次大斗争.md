The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Socialism is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and there exists the danger of capitalist restoration." The struggle practice of the past decade has made us deeply realize the absolute correctness, wisdom, and greatness of Chairman Mao's instruction. After we embarked on the cooperative road to Yangguan, our struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents has never stopped, and there have been five major struggles.

The struggle against the dismantling of cooperatives

The poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade have, for over a decade, followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "organizing together" as the "only way to go from poverty to prosperity." In 1951, we organized mutual aid teams. In 1954, 18 households of poor and lower-middle peasants in our village established the Yongxing Production Cooperative. At that time, our cooperative's production conditions were poor, and our foundation was weak. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements sneered at us, saying, "Joining the cooperative is good, joining the cooperative is good, people lack food, and horses lack grass." Two landlord households and one rich peasant household also organized a "strong and capable" fake mutual aid team, deliberately competing with us to try to crush us in production. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our cooperative did not listen to this nonsense. They firmly believed in the road pointed out by Chairman Mao, and their enthusiasm for running the cooperative was very high, and their production spirit was particularly strong. Although our cooperative's conditions were not as good as theirs, our production still far exceeded theirs. The following spring, our cooperative expanded to 30 households, and the poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as the director.

Just at this time, a "counter-attack against rash advance" black wind blew in. In May 1955, the original county committee conveyed Liu Shaoqi's "stop, shrink, and rectify" policy, and the original Hebei Provincial Committee also sent a large work team to our place to dismantle the cooperatives. I felt something was wrong as soon as I heard this, thinking, why is this different from Chairman Mao's instructions? At that time, I argued with them, saying, "Chairman Mao has long called on us to organize together and take the socialist road. Besides, our cooperative is running well, so why should it be dissolved?" They turned around and asked, "Has your cooperative caught up with the mutual aid team?" I said, "Our cooperative has been running for two years. Last year, we increased production by 20% compared to the mutual aid team. This year, the crops are growing even better. You can ask the poor and lower-middle peasants or go to the fields to see for yourselves." They asked again, "Does your cooperative have cadres?" I said, "I am a party member and I am a cadre. There are also a few other party members who are cadres. More than 20 households of poor and lower-middle peasants are all cadres who cannot be dispersed by sticks. Our cooperative is definitely established, and it cannot be dissolved. You don't need to implement this policy." The work team, upon hearing this, angrily said, "Let's talk about this for now, and we'll talk to the masses tomorrow to decide." The poor and lower-middle peasants and militia heard that the work team wanted to dissolve our cooperative and were very angry. They spontaneously gathered together to hold a meeting, discuss ways to deal with the work team, and some even wanted to go to the work team to reason with them. The poor and lower-middle peasants and militia's iron-hearted determination to take the socialist road increased my courage to resist the "dismantle cooperative" wind, making my backbone even stiffer. The next evening, the work team asked me to convene a cooperative members' meeting to convey the higher-level instructions. At the meeting, as soon as the work team raised the issue of dissolving the cooperative, the meeting erupted like a pot of boiling water, with poor and lower-middle peasants and militia members standing up one after another to speak. Some said, "Our cooperative is stronger than the mutual aid team, we have cadres, and the leadership is also good. No matter what you say, we cannot be dissolved." Some said, "Collectivization is the bright road pointed out by Chairman Mao. We have decided to take it, and no one can stop us." Some said, "Chairman Mao gave us the right to run cooperatives. We can only lead in collective production, not lead in individual farming." Everyone spoke, and every word was reasonable. The work team had no words to respond and could only disappointedly disperse the meeting.

We poor and lower-middle peasants have a deep understanding of whether collective or individual farming is better. Before liberation, not to mention, just take the period after land reform and before collectivization. In our village of over 50 households, there were seven or eight households doing odd jobs and half-day labor, four households fleeing famine, and some begging. Some households became rich, with carriages and horses, hiring workers and lending money, leading to serious polarization. At that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants were worried, feeling that if things continued this way, the old landlords would be overthrown, and new landlords would emerge. Since responding to Chairman Mao's call to establish cooperatives, this phenomenon has been stopped. Therefore, when they heard that the cooperatives were to be dissolved, they were furious. In those days, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our village missed Chairman Mao so much! After just two months, Chairman Mao published the brilliant work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," giving Liu Shaoqi a heavy blow. We poor and lower-middle peasants were so happy that we jumped up, saying, "Chairman Mao spoke for us. The cooperatives not only will not be dissolved but will also be developed!" That winter, a wave of collectivization emerged, and we merged with a few other cooperatives to establish a higher-level cooperative. As soon as the higher-level cooperative was established, it showed even greater advantages, further promoting the development of agricultural production. The following year, the average yield per unit area increased by one fold compared to before collectivization.

The struggle against dismantling the collective economy platform

In 1958, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's general line for socialist construction, our higher-level cooperative developed into a people's commune. As soon as the people's commune was established, it fully demonstrated its advantages of "being big and public." That winter, we studied the experience materials of treating Daguanshan, which Chairman Mao personally approved, and first treated our brigade's Pingding Mountain. In just three years, we turned a barren mountain of 12,000 mu, which caused disasters, into a mountain of blessings for the people. To carry forward this revolutionary spirit, we renamed Pingding Mountain as "Qiantian Mountain" and later renamed our Songzhangzi Brigade as Qiantian Brigade.

Just as we were advancing victoriously under Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the brilliant guidance of the three red banners, Liu Shaoqi and his agents took advantage of the temporary difficulties in our national economy to launch another black wind of dismantling the collective economy platform. In the winter of 1960, the original Lingyuan County Committee sent a work team to our brigade. They used the pretext of opposing the "five winds" to try to transfer our brigade's Qiantian Mountain to the production teams. At the same time, they also wanted to transfer our brigade's 13 types of enterprises, including blacksmith forges, carpentry workshops, weaving groups, forestry teams, and pig farms, to the production teams. At that time, I argued with them, saying, "Our Qiantian Mountain is vast, with many projects. If it is transferred to the production teams, there will be no unified thinking and inconsistent actions. One team cannot do it, two teams cannot do it well, and in a few days, the mountain will be destroyed. Isn't this purely dismantling the collective economy?" They said, "If you don't transfer it, you will adjust the labor force of the production teams, which will lead to the mistake of 'leveling and adjusting' again." I said, "We are accounting at the brigade level, and the labor force is originally arranged uniformly. There is no such thing as 'leveling and adjusting.' What we are doing is adhering to the socialist road and strengthening the collective economy, which is not a mistake." Seeing that they could not persuade me, the work team turned around and left. After returning to the county, they issued a circular, criticizing us by name for committing the mistake of "leveling and adjusting" again. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very angry after hearing this. They said, "Following Chairman Mao, even if our heads are cut off, we don't care. What's so great about issuing a circular? They issue their circulars, and we walk our Yangguan Road."

In 1961, our place suffered a severe drought, but because we adhered to the socialist direction and fully utilized the advantages of the brigade's collective economy, we not only overcame the difficulties but also promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production. The commune members further tasted the sweetness of the people's commune's "being big and public."

One wave had not yet subsided when another wave rose. That autumn, the original Chaoyang Regional Committee sent another work team. Their purpose upon entering the village was still to transfer our Qiantian Mountain and other brigade enterprises to the production teams. At that time, I was a bit impatient and told them, "We disagree with this pilot project. For our brigade, this is a retrogressive pilot project, not a progressive one. To build socialism, we must gradually expand the collective economy and gradually eliminate private economy. We cannot just focus on small, small, small, and end it. Dismantling a well-run collective economy is not socialism." The work team said, "Is this the opinion of the cadres? Let's find some masses to talk." That evening, a mass meeting was convened. At the meeting, some poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Our brigade is doing well this way. This year, we encountered such a big difficulty. If it weren't for the brigade's strong foundation and strength, we wouldn't be able to manage the land, let alone develop production and increase income?" Some poor and lower-middle peasants said, "To build socialism, we cannot each take care of ourselves. Our Pingchuan Team eats, and we must also make the mountain valley team eat. Everyone thinks together and works together to build socialism and achieve common prosperity." The work team, upon hearing this, could only say, "Your brigade is really different, even the masses disagree." The next day, they asked us to lead them to tour Qiantian Mountain. Facing the facts of the development and strengthening of the collective economy, the work team said, "Your brigade really has something, we won't dismantle your socialist platform."

The struggle to stop the "three autonomies and one contract" black wind

Liu Shaoqi and his agents were still not reconciled and launched another black wind of "three autonomies and one contract." This black wind also blew to our Qiantian Brigade. The Tiejiang Gou Production Team, due to small-scale reclamation, destroyed forests, and bullied the production team leaders. Some well-off middle peasants secretly prepared plows and seeds, ready to pull the frame for individual farming.

One day, I returned from a county meeting and encountered a commune member on the road. He requested more private plots, with five or six mu per household, leaving only the public grain land, and the rest would be allocated to the commune members. I said, "Wouldn't that be completely allocated?" He said, "Even if it's completely allocated, it's better than collective farming." Upon returning to the brigade, we immediately convened a meeting of the party branch committee members and production team leaders to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on class struggle and the struggle between two lines, and analyze the current situation of the commune members' thoughts. Some comrades said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Only socialism can save China.' Relying on small-scale reclamation and private plots to live is increasingly difficult. The more you rely on it, the more you will face ruin and beheadment." Everyone unanimously recognized that all these phenomena were the reflection of the sharp and intense struggle between the two roads and two lines in our brigade. Thus, the party branch, from within the party to outside the party, from the poor and lower-middle peasants to the commune members, carried out extensive socialist education and class struggle education. Through summarizing the development of the collective economy over the past few years, we extensively discussed the advantages of taking the socialist road. Through summarizing the experiences and lessons of spring plowing and summer weeding that year, we severely exposed the harm of small-scale reclamation to the collective economy. Our brigade has ten production teams, eight of which have no small-scale reclamation or only a small amount. These eight teams' fields all increased production. Two production teams had rampant small-scale reclamation, resulting in these two teams' fields all decreasing production. These living facts were the most powerful criticism of the reactionary fallacies of "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms." At the commune members' meeting, we mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to recall bitterness and sweetness. The commune members' awareness was raised, and they generally realized that no matter how many plans, no matter how many roads, not relying on the collective is a plan for poverty; no matter how many roads, not taking the socialist road is a road to ruin. Many poor and lower-middle peasants and militia members expressed their determination, saying, "Fear neither gods nor ghosts, follow Chairman Mao wholeheartedly to collectivize." "A typhoon of level 12 cannot blow us down, and the sky falling and the earth collapsing cannot shake us." Based on raising awareness, we repeatedly talked about the domestic and international class struggle situation, mobilizing the commune members to link up with the local class struggle reality, and extensively expose the cover of class struggle. A team of poor and lower-middle peasants struggled against the rich peasant element Li Yunlu, who incited and led small-scale reclamation, earning 800 jin of grain in one year, and put the hat back on him and put him under control. The black wind of capitalist flooding was finally stopped. Liu Shaoqi's "three autonomies and one contract" black wind suffered a complete failure in our brigade.

The struggle for the ideological leadership of the peasants

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." However, Liu Shaoqi stubbornly adhered to the reactionary bourgeois stance, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's great instruction, and vigorously advocating counter-revolutionary economism, material incentives, and the supremacy of work points. He said nonsense like, "During the transitional period, all methods that are beneficial to mobilizing the peasants' production enthusiasm can be used, and it is not necessary to say which method is the best and the only one." He attempted to use material incentives to exploit spontaneous capitalist tendencies, leading the peasants astray, and achieving his goal of restoring capitalism. Under the influence of his fallacies, in 1962, our region launched a black wind of "distributing grain according to labor and consideration." That spring, a department head of the original regional committee's rural work department led a work team to our county, peddling the experience of a certain brigade's "distributing grain according to labor and consideration." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must ask why for everything." I thought about it, this distribution method is a method of opposing the prominence of politics and advocating material incentives, a method of only ensuring a few people eat full while ignoring the majority starving. This is the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the ideological leadership of the peasants. I said, "This experience has problems. Our socialist system's superiority is what? Isn't it ensuring that the majority eat full and dress warm? It is absolutely not allowed to only let the strong eat full while watching the weak starve." They said, "Consideration can be added." I said, "Consideration is also not allowed. Too much consideration will produce a dependency mentality and also affect the enthusiasm of the labor force, which will do more harm than good; too little consideration will not be able to live. Even if the consideration is reasonable, it can only be like a toad hitting a fly, providing a mouthful. This way, the more consideration, the more breathless. On the other hand, implementing this method, those with more labor force and more work points will have surplus grain and will sell it at a high price in the free market; those with less labor force and fewer work points will not be able to guarantee basic rations and will have to buy grain at a high price in the market. This way, it is like the more thirsty, the more salt is eaten, the fatter, the more fat is added. Won't polarization reappear?" They still argued, insisting that we should focus on mobilizing the enthusiasm of the labor force. I said, "Mobilize what enthusiasm? This is a matter of principle. Implementing this material incentive method can only mobilize the enthusiasm of pursuing work points, the more it is mobilized, the greater the private interests, and the more capitalist tendencies will flood. Socialism cannot be built, and communism will never be realized."

Soon after that department head returned to the regional committee, the regional committee issued a "circular," criticizing us by name for not implementing the policy of "distributing grain according to labor and consideration." I said, "Let them criticize, criticism is a small matter, building socialism is a big matter. Communist Party members must have a stance in critical moments and cannot be irresponsible to the party."

The next day, the original Lingyuan County Committee secretary came to our brigade with a work team, personally presiding over a meeting attended by three types of people. At the meeting, he first asked those with less labor force and more people which distribution method they liked. The poor peasant commune member Gao Peixian said, "Any method is fine, who cares about us having many people, starving to death is deserved!" He heard the words were not to his liking and asked those with neither too much nor too little labor force. These commune members said, "To build socialism, everyone must have food to eat, and it cannot be rich getting richer and poor getting poorer, that's like individual farming. Socialism must be built by all the people of the nation, and the land of the production team must be taken care of by all the commune members. Everyone thinks together and works together to build socialism and achieve common prosperity." Only two households with more labor force agreed with the method of "distributing grain according to labor and consideration," but they were the minority and could not pass. However, this secretary was still not reconciled and helped the production team leader Ma Xuecai calculate the grain distribution account. After calculating, he said to him, "If this method is implemented, each person in your family will eat 50 jin more grain. Why don't you calculate this account?" Ma Xuecai replied with righteous indignation, "I am a team leader serving everyone. Calculating accounts must calculate everyone's accounts, calculate the socialist big accounts, and cannot only calculate one's own small accounts." These words were so righteous that the secretary was speechless. Thus, their attempt to corrupt the poor and lower-middle peasants ideologically to restore capitalism failed again.

The struggle to defend the red regime

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I experienced another test of the struggle between two lines. Not long after the cultural revolution began in our place, a few class enemies deceived and incited some of the masses, suddenly occupying the brigade office and announcing that they had seized my power. They forced me to admit that I had close ties with landlords and rich peasants and questioned me, "Where do you want to lead the Qiantian Brigade?" No matter what methods they used, I always said the same three sentences: "I have shortcomings and errors in my work, but the direction is correct, and I have not mixed with landlords and rich peasants." Later, under the protest of some of the masses, the class enemies, in order not to expose themselves too much, let me go home to eat and stay, and reflect during the day in a concentrated manner. Back home, my wife saw me thin and was both concerned and wanted to pull me back. She said to me, "Revolution, revolution, what have you gained? You've worked hard and been persecuted, served as an official for a lifetime, and slept for half of it." I studied Chairman Mao's quotations and felt that her words were wrong. Those days, I thought about many problems. I thought about how, in the old society, my family was so poor that my father died of illness, my mother died of hunger, and my younger brother, because he begged for food, was bitten by a landlord's dog and died, leaving only me to work for the landlord. It was not until 1947 when the Communist Party came that Chairman Mao saved me from the fire pit. From the time of land reform, I became an official, following Chairman Mao to make a revolution and take the road of collectivization. For the construction of socialism and the long-term interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I have experienced countless struggles and encountered countless setbacks, but I have never turned back. Should I turn back this time? Should I hand over power? At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making every living person's heart ache when thinking of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" Thinking of the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution, how could I not do it when encountering such a small setback in the movement? I could not, not doing it would be disloyal to Chairman Mao and a betrayal of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, which would be falling into the trap of the class enemies. Persecuting me was only the class enemies and a few people with ulterior motives. They implemented Liu Shaoqi's reactionary bourgeois line; the majority of the masses were good, they listened to Chairman Mao's words, would correctly treat the cadres, and would implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I should direct my hatred towards Liu Shaoqi and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and not blame the broad masses. Thinking of this, I finally regained my strength and used these reasons to persuade my wife.

The spring plowing began, but the class enemies who seized power did not care about production and spent the whole day outside making connections. I repeatedly raised objections to them and, under their surveillance, insisted on going to various production teams to help arrange production. Those days, although they restricted my actions, because I insisted on taking charge, the construction of reservoirs, drilling wells, terraced fields, and afforestation proceeded as usual, without any delay. It was in the process of taking charge of production that I, in possible situations, also insisted on propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the masses, raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle.

In March 1967, the army's agricultural support troops came to our brigade. In this difficult time, seeing relatives was like seeing light in the dark, and I was so happy! Not long after, the majority of the masses, with the help of the army, finally saw through the true face of the class enemies inciting the masses to fight the masses and united again, suppressing the reactionary momentum of the class enemies.

After the revolutionary factions united, according to Chairman Mao's correct instructions on treating cadres, I made a sincere self-criticism to the masses, accepted the masses' criticism and help, and officially returned to work. Soon, the brigade established a new leadership team, and I was elected as the main responsible person again.

After the new leadership team was established, the first problem we encountered was how to correctly treat the masses. At that time, although the great unity was achieved, a few masses were still deceived. How to deal with these few masses? Opinions were not unified, some advocated suppression, and some advocated abandonment. I felt that these methods were all wrong and could not correctly treat the masses, which was against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Thus, I studied with the poor and lower-middle peasants and the leadership team members on how Chairman Mao dealt with the contradictions among the people. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that we should distinguish a small handful of class enemies from the majority of the masses. We and those masses are class brothers, and we should strive to unite them, making them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After 20 nights of study and ideological work, most comrades returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, further consolidating the great unity of the entire brigade. After the masses' awareness was raised, we actively attacked the class enemies, exposing a few class enemies and criticizing them, severely striking the enemy.

To consolidate the red regime and educate the broad masses, we combined the actual struggle between the two lines in our brigade over the past decade with the tasks of each period and carried out in-depth and long-term revolutionary criticism. The deeper we criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, the more firmly we could establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Through the above five major struggles, we have a deeper understanding that in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the struggle between the two lines is always present. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the revolutionary line that leads us to socialism and communism, and it is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Liu Shaoqi's reactionary bourgeois line is the reactionary line that pulls us into the capitalist dead end, and it is the mortal enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants' awareness of class struggle and line struggle has been greatly raised. They understand that whatever is in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line must be done, and whatever is not in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line must be resisted. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line must be fought against. We must dedicate our lives, blood, and lives to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    两条路线在我们大队的五次大斗争
    辽宁省活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子　辽宁省革命委员会委员　马成
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”十几年来的斗争实践，使我们深刻地认识到毛主席这一教导的无比的正确、英明和伟大。我们走上合作化阳关大道之后，同刘少奇及其代理人的斗争一直没有停止过，其中比较大的斗争就有五次。
          反对砍合作社的斗争
    我们欺天大队的贫下中农，十几年来一直遵照毛主席他老人家关于“组织起来”是“由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”的教导，在集体化的道路上奋勇前进。一九五一年我们就组织互助组。一九五四年，我们村十八户贫下中农，又办起了永兴生产合作社。那时候，我们社的生产条件很差，底子很薄。地、富、反、坏分子讥笑我们说：“入社好，入社好，人缺吃的马缺草。”两户地主、一户富农还拉拢了几户富裕中农组织起一个“人强马壮”的假互助组，故意和我们唱对台戏，企图在生产上压垮我们。可是，我们社的贫下中农不听这个邪，一心相信毛主席给我们指的路，办社的心非常盛，生产的劲头也特别足。尽管我们社的条件不如他们，可是生产却大大超过他们。第二年春，我们社扩大到三十户，贫下中农选我当了主任。
    就在这个时候，刮来了一股“反冒进”的黑风。一九五五年五月，原县委传达了刘少奇提出的“停、缩、整”方针，原热河省委也派来了一个庞大的工作组到我们这里来砍合作社。我一听就觉得不对劲，心里想，这为啥和毛主席的指示不一样？当时我就和他们辩论起来，我说：“毛主席早就号召我们组织起来走社会主义道路啊。再说，我们的社办得好好的，怎么要解散呢？”他们就反过来问：“那你们社赶上互助组了吗？”我说：“我们社办了两年了，去年比互助组增产二成，今年庄稼长得更好，不信你们问问贫下中农去，还可以到地里看看。”他们又问：“你们社有骨干吗？”我说：“我是党员，我就是骨干，还有几个党员也是骨干，二十多户贫下中农都是棒打不散的骨干。我们这个合作社算办定了，说什么也不能散。你们这个政策也不用贯彻了。”工作组一听，气呼呼地说：“先谈到这儿吧，明天找群众谈谈再定。”贫下中农和民兵听说工作组要解散我们的合作社，都非常气愤，他们自动围拢在一起开会，研究对付工作组的办法，有的还要找工作组去评理。贫下中农和民兵们走社会主义道路的铁心劲，增加了我顶住“砍社”风的勇气，使我腰杆子更硬了。第二天晚上，工作组让我召开社员大会贯彻上级的指示。在会上，工作组把散社的问题刚提出来，会场就象炸了锅一样，贫下中农和民兵纷纷站起来抢着发言。有的说：我们社比互助组强，又有骨干，干部领导得也好，说出花来也不能散。有的说：集体化是毛主席他老人家指出的光明大道，我们算是走定了，谁也挡不住。有的说：毛主席给了我们办合作社的权，只能带头搞集体生产，不能带头闹单干。大家你一言，我一语，条条在理，工作组无言可对，只好扫兴地散了会。
    对集体好还是单干好，我们贫下中农体会得太深了。解放前不提，就拿土改后合作化前这段来说，我们村五十多户，做短工和扛半拉活的就有七、八户，逃荒的有四户，还有要饭的。有些户又发了财，拴车拉马，雇工放债，出现了严重的两极分化。当时，贫下中农忧心忡忡，觉得这样下去，旧地主打倒了，又会出新地主。自从响应毛主席的号召，办起合作社以后，才制止了这种现象。所以，大家一听要砍合作社，气就不打一处来。在那些天里，我们村的贫下中农多么想念毛主席啊！没过两个月，毛主席发表了《关于农业合作化问题》这篇光辉著作，给大砍合作社的刘少奇当头一棒。我们贫下中农听了都高兴得跳了起来，说：“毛主席替我们说话了，合作社不光散不了，还得大干哩！”这年冬天，出现了合作化高潮，我们和其它几个合作社合并在一起，成立了高级社。高级社一成立，立刻显示了更大的优越性，进一步促进了农业生产的发展，第二年平均单产就比合作化前增长了一倍。
        抵制拆集体经济台的斗争
    一九五八年，在毛主席亲自制定的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我们的高级社又发展为人民公社。人民公社刚一建立就充分显示了它的“一大二公”的优越性。这年冬天，我们学习了毛主席亲自批示的治理大泉山的经验材料，首先治理了我们大队的平顶山。只用了三年时间，就把一个面积一万二千亩的降灾生祸的秃山变成了为民造福的宝山。为了发扬这种革命精神，我们把平顶山改名“欺天山”，后来把我们宋仗子大队也改名欺天大队了。
    正当我们在毛主席的英明领导下，在三面红旗光辉照耀下，胜利前进的时候，刘少奇和他的代理人，趁着我国国民经济遭到暂时困难的机会，又掀起了一股拆集体经济台的黑风。一九六○年冬，原凌源县委派工作组到我们大队来，他们以反“五风”为名，妄想把我们大队的欺天山放到生产队去。同时，还要把我们大队所有的铁匠炉、木工厂、编织组、林业队、猪场等十三种企业也要放到生产队去。当时，我就同他们顶起来：“我们的欺天山面积大，工程多，如果放到生产队去，思想不统一，行动不一致，一个队搞不了，两个队搞不好，用不了几天就把山给毁了。这不纯粹是拆散集体经济吗？”他们又说：“你们不放，调生产队的劳动力，这就要重犯一平二调的错误。”我说：“我们是大队核算，劳动力本来就是统一安排，不存在什么一平二调。我们这样做，是坚持社会主义道路，加强集体经济，没有什么错误。”工作组一看说服不了我，扭头就走了。他们回县后，发了一个通报，点名批评我们重犯“一平二调”的错误。贫下中农听了以后非常生气。他们说：“跟着毛主席走，就是脑袋掉了也不在乎，通报一下有什么了不起，他通他的报，我们走我们的阳关道。”
    一九六一年，我们那里遭到特大旱灾，但是，由于我们坚持了社会主义方向，充分发挥了大队集体经济的优越性，不但战胜了困难，还促进了工农业生产的发展，社员进一步尝到了人民公社“一大二公”的甜头。
    一波未平，一波又起。这年秋后，原朝阳地委又派来了一个工作组。他们进村的目的还是想把我们的欺天山和大队的其他企业放到生产队去。当时，我就有点不耐烦，对他们讲：“你们搞这个试点我们不同意，这对我们大队来说，是后退的试点，不是前进的试点。搞社会主义就是要逐步扩大集体经济，逐步消灭私有经济，不能只搞小小小，了了了。把搞得好好的集体经济整散了，就不是社会主义。”工作组又说：
  “这是你们干部的意见吧！找些群众来谈。”晚上，召开了群众座谈会。会上有的贫下中农说：“我们大队这么搞挺好，今年遇到这么大困难，要不是大队的底子厚，气力粗，连地都侍弄不过来，那能发展生产增加收入呢？”有的贫下中农说：“搞社会主义嘛，不能各顾各，我们平川队吃上饭，也得叫山沟队吃上饭。大家心往一处想，劲往一处使，才能建设社会主义，共同富裕嘛！”工作组一听，只好说：“你们大队真隔样，连群众也不同意。”第二天要我们领着他们到欺天山上转了一圈，在集体经济发展壮大的事实面前，工作组才说：“你们大队还真有点玩艺，我们不拆你们的社会主义台子了。”
      刹住“三自一包”黑风的斗争
    刘少奇和他的代理人仍不死心，又刮起了一股
  “三自一包”的黑风。这股黑风，也吹到了我们欺天大队。铁匠沟生产队由于搞小开荒，有的毁林，有的拱生产队地头子，集体的地没心思侍弄。有的富裕中农偷偷地准备下犁杖、种子，拉着架子准备单干。
    一天，我从县里开会回来，在路上碰见一个社员，他要求自留地多放点，一户放五、六亩，留下公粮地以外，余下的都给社员放下去。我说：“那不放净了吗？”他说：“放净了也比集体种强。”回到大队，我们针对这个问题立即召开了党支部委员和生产队长会，反复学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的指示，分析了当时社员的思想情况。有的同志说：“毛主席教导我们：‘只有社会主义能够救中国。’靠小开荒、自留地过日子，越靠越困难，靠来靠去就得家破国亡，人头落地。”大家一致认识到，所有这些现象，都是尖锐、激烈的两条道路、两条路线斗争在我们大队的反映。于是，党支部从党内到党外，从贫下中农到社员群众，进行了大张旗鼓的社会主义教育和阶级斗争教育。通过总结几年集体经济的发展，大讲走社会主义道路的优越性，通过总结当年春耕、夏锄的经验教训，狠揭小开荒对集体经济的危害性。我们大队共十个生产队，其中八个生产队没有小开荒，或者只有少量小开荒，这八个队的大田都增了产。有两个生产队小开荒大泛滥，结果这两个队的大田都大减产。这种活生生的事实是对“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反动谬论的最有力的批判。在社员大会上，发动贫下中农忆苦思甜。社员觉悟提高了，普遍认识到，千打算，万打算，不依靠集体就是穷打算；千条路，万条路，不走社会主义道路就是走绝路。许多贫下中农和民兵表示决心说：“神不怕，鬼不怕，一心跟毛主席走集体化。”“十二级台风刮不倒，天塌地陷不动摇”。在提高觉悟的基础上，又反复讲了国内外阶级斗争形势，发动社员群众联系本地阶级斗争实际，大揭阶级斗争盖子。一队贫下中农斗争了煽动和带头搞小开荒一年收粮八百斤的富农分子李云禄，重新给他带上帽子，管制起来。资本主义泛滥的黑风这才刹住了。刘少奇刮起的“三自一包”黑风，在我们大队遭到了彻底的失败。
      争夺对农民思想领导权的斗争
    毛主席教导我们说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”可是刘少奇却顽固地坚持资产阶级反动立场，拚命地反对毛主席这一伟大指示，极力鼓吹反革命经济主义，物质刺激，工分挂帅。他胡说什么：“过渡时期一切有利于调动农民生产积极性的办法都可以，不要说那一种办法是最好的，唯一的。”企图用物质刺激的办法，利用自发的资本主义倾向，把农民引向邪路，实现其复辟资本主义的目的。在他的一派谬论的影响下，一九六二年，我们地区又刮起了“按劳分配加照顾”的分配口粮的黑风。
    这年春天，原地委一个农村工作部部长率领工作组到我们县，兜售某个大队“按劳分配加照顾”的分配口粮的经验。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么”。我一琢磨，这个分配办法是一个反对突出政治，提倡物质刺激的办法，是只顾少数人吃饱，不管多数人挨饿的办法，这是资产阶级同无产阶级争夺对农民思想领导权的斗争。我说：“这个经验有问题，咱们社会主义制度的优越性在哪？不就是保证大多数人吃的饱、穿的暖吗？绝不能只让力气大的吃个大肚圆，而看着力量小的挨饿。”他们说：“可以加照顾嘛。”我说：“照顾也不行，照顾多了会产生依赖思想，也会影响劳动力的积极性，这就帮了倒忙；照顾少了生活过不去。就是照顾的合理，也只能是癞蛤蟆打苍蝇将供嘴，这样越照顾越缓不过气来。另一方面，实行这个办法，劳动力多、挣工分多的，粮食吃不了，就会到自由市场去卖高价；劳动力少、工分少的，保证不了基本口粮，就得到集市用高价买粮。这样就等于越渴越吃盐，越胖越添膘，不又出现两极分化了吗？”他们还强辩，硬要我们从调动劳动力积极性着眼。我说：“调动什么积极性，这是个原则问题。实行这个物质刺激的办法，只能是调动追求工分的积极性，越调动私心越大，资本主义越泛滥。社会主义不能建成，共产主义永远实现不了。”
    那位部长回地委不久，地委发了个“纪要”，点名批评我们不执行“按劳分配加照顾”的分配口粮的政策。我说：“爱批评就批评，批评是小事，搞社会主义是大事，共产党员在关键时刻，得有个立场，不能够对党不负责任。”
    第二天，原凌源县委书记又带着工作组来到我们大队，亲自主持召开了一个有三种类型人物参加的座谈会。在会上，他首先问劳动力少人口多的喜欢哪种分配办法？贫农社员高佩贤说：“照哪个办法都行，谁叫我们人口多哩，饿死活该！”他一听话不对味，就又问劳动力不多不少的社员，这些社员说：“搞社会主义得人人有饭吃，不能富的富，穷的穷，那不成单干了？社会主义得全国人民建设，生产队的地得全体社员侍弄。大家齐心努力才能搞好社会主义。”只有两户劳动力多的户同意“按劳分配加照顾”的办法，但他们是少数，通不过。可是这位书记还不死心，又帮助生产队长马学才算粮食分配账，算完后向他说：“要实行这个办法，你家每口人多吃五十斤粮，你为啥不算这个账呢？”马学才理直气壮地回答说：“我这个队长是为大家服务的，算账要算大家的账，算社会主义大账，不能光算自己的小账。”这几句话义正辞严，驳得这个书记哑口无言。就这样，他们企图在思想上腐蚀贫下中农，以便复辟资本主义的阴谋又宣告失败了。
        捍卫红色政权的斗争
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我又经历了两条路线斗争的一次考验。我们那里文化革命开始不久，少数阶级敌人蒙蔽和煽动了一部分群众，突然占领了大队的办公室，宣布夺了我的权。他们硬逼我承认和地富有八拜之交，还质问我：“要把欺天大队引向何方？”不管他们施什么手段，我总是那三句话：“我工作中有缺点错误，但是方向没有错，和地富没混线。”后来，在一部分群众的抗议下，阶级敌人为了不太暴露自己，就让我回家吃住、白天集中反省了。回到家，我老婆一看我瘦了，她真是又疼我，又想借机拉我后腿。她对我说：“革命，革命，你得着啥了，操心费力落个挨整，当一辈子干部睡半辈子觉。”我学习了毛主席语录，感到她的话不对。那些天，我脑子里想了很多问题。想起在旧社会，我家穷得精光，病死了爸爸，饿死了妈妈，弟弟因为讨饭被地主的狗咬伤而死，只剩我一个给地主扛活。一直到一九四七年共产党来了，毛主席才把我从火坑里救了出来。从土地改革时，我就当干部，跟着毛主席闹革命，走集体化道路。为了建设社会主义，为了贫下中农的长远利益，经过了多少次斗争，遇到多少次挫折，都没回过头。这次就回头吗？就交权吗？这时又想起了毛主席的教导：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”想到先烈为了革命牺牲都不怕，难道我在运动中遇上这么点小挫折就不干吗？不能，不干就是对毛主席不忠，就是对广大贫下中农的背叛，也就是中了阶级敌人的诡计。整我，只是阶级敌人和少数别有用心的人，他们执行的是刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线；大多数群众是好的，他们是听毛主席话的，是会正确地对待干部的，是会执行毛主席的革命路线的。我应当把仇恨记在刘少奇和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子身上，不能埋怨广大群众。想到这里，我才转过劲来，又用这些道理说服了我的老婆。
    开始备耕了，可是夺了权的阶级敌人对生产不闻不问，整天到外边串连。我就三番五次找他们提意见，并且在他们监视下坚持到各生产队帮助安排生产。那些天，虽然他们限制我的行动，但由于我坚持抓，修水库、打电井、修梯田、植树造林照样进行，一点也没耽误。就在抓生产过程中，我在可能的情况下，还坚持向群众宣传毛主席的革命路线，提高群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。
    一九六七年三月，解放军支农大军来到了我们大队，在这困难的时候看到了亲人，真象在黑暗中看到光明一样，我内心是多么高兴啊！过了没有多久，多数群众在解放军的帮助下，终于看清了阶级敌人挑动群众斗群众的真面目，重新联合起来，把阶级敌人的反动气焰压了下去。
    革命派大联合后，按照毛主席的正确对待干部的教导，让我向群众作了认真的检查，接受了群众的批判和帮助，我就正式站出来工作了。不久，大队建立了新的领导班子，我又被推选为主要负责人。
    新班子成立后，遇到的第一个问题，就是如何正确对待群众的问题。当时，虽然搞了大联合，但还有少数的群众仍然受着蒙蔽。对这些少数群众怎么办？意见不统一，有的主张压服，有的主张甩掉。我觉得这些作法都不对，不能正确对待群众，就是违背毛主席的革命路线。于是就和贫下中农、领导班子成员共同学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的论述。经过讨论，大家一致认为，要把一小撮阶级敌人和大多数群众区别开，我们和那部分群众是阶级弟兄，要争取团结他们，使他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。经过二十个晚上的学习和思想教育工作，大部分同志都回到毛主席革命路线上来了，进一步巩固了全大队的革命大联合。群众觉悟提高以后，我们就主动地向阶级敌人进攻，把那几个阶级敌人揪出来进行了批斗，狠狠地打击了敌人。
    为了巩固红色政权，教育广大群众，我们结合十几年来我们大队两条路线斗争的实际，结合每个时期的任务，展开了深入持久的革命大批判。对刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线批得越深，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线才能树得越牢。
    通过以上五次大斗争，使我们更深刻地认识到，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，始终贯串着两条路线的激烈斗争，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是引导我们走向社会主义和共产主义的革命路线，是贫下中农的命根子。刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线是把我们拉向资本主义死胡同的反动路线，是我们贫下中农的死对头。通过这场文化大革命，广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟极大地提高了，他们懂得了凡是符合毛主席革命路线的事就要干，凡是不符合毛主席革命路线的事就要顶，谁要是反对毛主席的革命路线，就得和他拚。我们要一生一世，不惜鲜血和生命来保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
