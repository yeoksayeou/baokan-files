The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held a meeting to celebrate the eighth anniversary of its establishment.

Newspaper report from Hanoi, December 21st: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held a meeting on the evening of the 19th to enthusiastically celebrate the eighth anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho, Vice Chairman Pham Van Cong, Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Military Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, Nguyen Van Thieu, and other members of the Central Committee attended the meeting.

Attending the meeting were also members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, members of the People's Liberation Armed Forces Command, representatives of various political parties, organizations, and religious groups, representatives from various cities and their surrounding areas, and over a thousand representatives from the liberated areas.

After Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho delivered the opening speech, Vice Chairman Pham Van Cong, on behalf of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, delivered a speech. He enthusiastically praised the tremendous victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam over the past eight years.

In analyzing the great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam, Pham Van Cong said: "This is the victory of the strong patriotic spirit of our military and people, the glorious victory of the revolutionary heroism of the Vietnamese people, and the victory of the correct line of the National Liberation Front as embodied in the political program published in September 1967."

Pham Van Cong, on behalf of the people of the South and the National Liberation Front, enthusiastically congratulated the heroic military and people of the North on their victories and sincerely thanked the people of the world for their support. He said: Under the wise leadership of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the fraternal military and people of the North have defeated the extremely brutal and destructive war waged by American imperialism, mainly using air and naval forces, and have dealt a thunderous blow to the aggressors.

Pham Van Cong said that the failure of American imperialism is evident, but it does not give up its schemes and ambitions to occupy our country, continuing to intensify the war in the South and continuing to provoke and sabotage the North. It still strives to maintain and support the American puppet regime in Saigon, which represents no one.

Pham Van Cong said, we will resolutely fight to achieve our fundamental goal: South Vietnam must achieve independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and prosperity, and then peacefully reunify the country. Our people love peace and yearn for peace, but it must be peace based on independence and freedom.

Pham Van Cong emphasized the need to respond to Comrade Ho Chi Minh's teachings: "As long as there is one aggressor on our land, we will continue to fight and drive them all out."

Pham Van Cong called on all military and people of the South to advance, overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and bravely fight against the American aggressors, overthrow the puppet regime of Nguyen Van Thieu, Nguyen Cao Ky, and Tran Van Huong, and lead the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation to complete victory.

Subsequently, Deputy Commander of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, Nguyen Thi Dinh, read the appeal of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front. Then, representatives of the People's Liberation Armed Forces and representatives of various strata of people in the South spoke at the meeting, expressing their enthusiastic response to the appeal of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, and vowing to spare no effort to drive out the American aggressors, overthrow the puppet regime, seize all power back to the people, and lead the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation to complete victory.

    新华社河内二十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团，十九日晚上举行集会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立八周年。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，副主席冯文恭，副主席、民族解放阵线中央委员会军事委员会主任陈南忠以及主席团的其他成员出席了集会。
    出席集会的还有民族解放阵线中央委员会委员，人民解放武装力量指挥部的成员，各政党、团体和宗教界的代表，各城市及其附近地区的代表，以及解放区人民的一千多名代表等。
    阮友寿主席致开幕词后，冯文恭副主席代表民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团发表了讲话。他热烈赞扬越南南方军民八年来取得的极其巨大的胜利。
    冯文恭在分析越南南方人民取得的伟大胜利的原因时说：“这是我们军民的强烈的爱国主义精神的胜利，是越南人民革命英雄主义的辉煌胜利，是体现在一九六七年九月公布的民族解放阵线的政治纲领中的民族解放阵线的正确路线的胜利。”
    冯文恭代表南方人民和民族解放阵线，热烈祝贺英雄的北方军民的胜利，并对世界各国人民的支持表示真诚的感谢。他说：在敬爱的胡主席的英明领导下，骨肉的北方军民战胜了美帝国主义主要用空军和海军进行的极其残暴的破坏性战争，给侵略者以雷霆般的打击。
    冯文恭说，美帝国主义的失败是明显的了，但是它不肯放弃侵占我国的阴谋和野心，仍然在继续加强对南方的战争，继续对北方进行挑衅和破坏。它仍然竭力维持和帮助代表不了任何人的美国的工具——西贡政权。
    冯文恭说，我们将坚决战斗，一定要实现我们的基本目标：越南南方必须获得独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣，进而和平统一祖国。我国人民十分爱好和平，渴望和平，但必须是建立在独立和自由基础上的和平。
    冯文恭强调必须响应胡主席的教导：“只要在我国土地上还有一个侵略者，我们就要继续战斗，把它全部赶出去。”
    冯文恭号召南方全体军民冲上前去，克服一切艰难险阻，不怕牺牲，不畏艰苦，坚决赶走美国强盗，推翻阮文绍—阮高其—陈文香美国走狗伪政权，把抗美救国事业引向彻底胜利。
    接着，人民解放武装力量副司令员阮氏定宣读了民族解放阵线中央委员会的号召书。随后，人民解放武装力量代表和南方各阶层人民代表先后在会上发言，表示热烈响应民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团的号召，竭尽全力赶走美国佬，推翻伪政权，把全部政权夺回到人民手里，把抗美救国事业引向彻底胜利。
