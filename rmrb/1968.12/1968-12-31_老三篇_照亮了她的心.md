Liu Fenglian traveled from the interior to the Qinghai Plateau to visit her husband, Gao Zhaonan. As soon as she entered the unit, she saw Gao Zhaonan wearing work clothes and carrying a yoke with buckets of pig feed, clearly a swineherd. Liu Fenglian felt quite disheartened.

That evening, Liu Fenglian spoke to her husband, "Gao, others have learned to drive cars, but you've been in the army for seven or eight years and are still just a swineherd, without any technical skills. What will you do to serve the people when you demobilize?" Gao Zhaonan heard her words and thought that she hadn't studied the 'Three Articles' thoroughly and lacked awareness of the struggle between the two lines. He decided to help her raise her awareness of the line struggle. Gao Zhaonan took out the 'Three Articles' and said to her, "Your education is higher than mine, please read the 'Three Articles' to me!" Liu Fenglian took the shining red revolutionary book and finished reading the 'Three Articles' in no time. Gao Zhaonan then asked, "Zhang Thied in the revolutionary ranks was a charcoal burner. Do you think that counts as serving the people?" Liu Fenglian responded loudly, "Zhang Thied is a shining example of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people!" Gao Zhaonan then asked, "Then does feeding pigs count as serving the people?" Liu Fenglian, embarrassed, lowered her head and softly said, "Feeding pigs is also serving the people. I think if I learn some skills, I can make greater contributions to the people." Gao Zhaonan, addressing her active thoughts, recited a passage from Chairman Mao's 'In Memory of Norman Bethune': "A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a person of high moral character, a pure person, a person with virtue, a person who has cast off low desires, a person beneficial to the people." Gao Zhaonan continued, "Serving the people is not about skills, but about the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao. The purely technical viewpoint is poisoned by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's 'technology first' fallacy. We must resolutely criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of 'technology first' and follow Chairman Mao in wholeheartedly serving the people." Liu Fenglian was greatly inspired by her husband's words and said, "I understand now, only by acting according to the 'Three Articles' can one truly serve the people."

Gao Zhaonan, seeing that his wife had gained some understanding, took the opportunity to talk about their bitter family history in the old society. In the old society, they were both poor children, like bitter gourds on the same vine. Gao Zhaonan was forced to herd sheep for the landlord, and Liu Fenglian was forced to herd pigs. Once, Liu Fenglian was herding pigs on the mountain when suddenly a wolf appeared and carried off a piglet. The heartless landlord, upon hearing this, beat Liu Fenglian until she was half-dead and kicked her out the door. At this point, Liu Fenglian's tears flowed freely, and she said, "I was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'technology first' fallacy and almost forgot my roots. I am unworthy of Chairman Mao."

From then on, Liu Fenglian and Gao Zhaonan studied the 'Three Articles' together and fed pigs together. One day, Gao Zhaonan fell ill, and the quartermaster planned to assign another comrade to feed the pigs. Liu Fenglian, upon hearing this, said to the quartermaster, "The kitchen is short-staffed and busy, so why don't you assign the pig-feeding task to me?" The quartermaster said, "You traveled thousands of miles to visit our unit and should rest well." Liu Fenglian firmly replied, "Comrade Bethune was a foreigner who traveled thousands of miles to China to help in the anti-Japanese war. I should learn from Comrade Bethune." Saying this, she rushed to feed the pigs. The unit comrades praised Liu Fenglian, saying, "The 'Three Articles' have illuminated her heart." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### “老三篇”照亮了她的心

    “老三篇”照亮了她的心
    刘凤莲从内地千里迢迢地来到青海高原看望她爱人高照南，一走进连队就看到高照南身穿工作服，挑着一担猪食桶，正在?喝猪，一看就知道是个饲养员，刘凤莲感到很不是滋味。
    晚上，刘凤莲对爱人说：“老高，人家都学会开汽车了，你参军七、八年还是个饲养员，一点技术也不懂，将来复员看你拿什么为人民服务？”高照南一听她的话，心想她学习“老三篇”还没有很好地在“用”字上下功夫，两条路线斗争觉悟还不高，决心帮助她提高路线斗争觉悟。高照南拿出了
  “老三篇”，并对她说：“你的文化比我高，给我读一读‘老三篇’吧！”刘凤莲接过红光闪闪的革命宝书，一会就把“老三篇”读完了。高照南接着问：“张思德在革命队伍中是烧木炭的，你说算不算为人民服务？”刘凤莲响亮地回答：“张思德是‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务的光辉榜样！”高照南又问：“那喂猪算不算为人民服务？”刘凤莲被爱人这一问，不好意思地低下了头，轻声地说：“喂猪也是为人民服务，我想学点技术会为人民作出更大的贡献。”高照南针对她这种活思想又念了毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中的一段教导：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”高照南接着对她说：“为人民服务不是靠技术，而是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠忠于毛主席的一颗红心。单纯的技术观点是中了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇‘技术第一’的流毒。我们一定要狠批刘少奇‘技术第一’的反动谬论，跟着毛主席全心全意为人民服务。”刘凤莲从爱人的一席话中得到很大启发，便说：“我明白了，只有按‘老三篇’去行动，才是真正的为人民服务。”
    高照南看到爱人的思想有了认识，就因势利导地讲起了他俩在旧社会的苦难家史。在旧社会他俩都是很苦的穷孩子，是一根藤上结的苦瓜。高照南被迫给地主放羊，刘凤莲被迫给地主放猪。一次，刘凤莲在山上放猪，忽然跑来了一只恶狼，叼走了一只小猪，狠心的地主知道后，把刘凤莲打得死去活来，并把她一脚踢出了门坎。说到这里，刘凤莲眼泪夺眶而出，她说：“我中了刘少奇‘技术第一’的流毒，差点忘了本，我对不起毛主席。”
    从此，刘凤莲和老高一起学习“老三篇”，一起喂猪。一天，高照南病了，司务长准备另派一位同志去喂猪。刘凤莲知道后对司务长说：“炊事班人少，工作忙，你就把养猪这个工作交给我吧！”司务长说：
  “你千里迢迢来到咱队上探亲，应该好好休息一下。”刘凤莲却坚定地说：“白求恩同志是一个外国人，不远万里来到中国，帮助中国的抗日战争，我应该向白求恩同志学习。”说着，她就抢先去喂猪了。连队同志们纷纷赞扬刘凤莲说：“老三篇”照亮了她的心。（据新华社讯）
