The reactionary film *Visit to Indonesia* is a confession by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, who acted as a running dog for imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries. Liu Shaoqi, following the example of Soviet revisionist leader Khrushchev, committed numerous treacherous acts during his "visit" to Indonesia, betraying the party and the country, and selling out the interests of socialism and the world's revolutionary people. He fraternized with the right-wing military clique in Indonesia, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian revolutionary people, and this once again exposed his long-standing opposition to the people's revolutionary armed struggle. He attempted to collude with the counter-revolutionary army to realize his counter-revolutionary plots, revealing his wolfish ambitions.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "From the standpoint of Marxist state theory, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and retain it must have a powerful army."

The people's army is an important tool for the proletariat to seize and consolidate power. The bourgeois army is a tool for the bourgeoisie to maintain its reactionary rule and suppress the laboring people. The attitude towards these two different types of armies is a dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. However, Liu Shaoqi, who wore the cloak of a "Communist Party member" and the label of "State Chairman," during his "visit" to Indonesia, fawned over the reactionary Indonesian military as the "tool for realizing the ideals of the Indonesian people" and a "revolutionary instrument." In the film, we also see Liu Shaoqi shaking hands with the butchers of fascism, the running dogs of American imperialism, such as Nasution, and sincerely wishing him "good health." At a musical performance, Liu Shaoqi even played the bamboo instrument "angklung" with these bloodthirsty reactionary soldiers, openly declaring their "harmonious cooperation" and "unity"!

The great traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi praised the reactionary right-wing military clique, blurring the fundamental differences between the bourgeois reactionary army and the people's revolutionary armed struggle. What did they intend to "cooperate" on? It was to lull the people's fighting spirit, disarm the revolutionary people, and lead them down the path of revisionist "parliamentary struggle," meekly submitting to bourgeois dictatorship.

Liu Shaoqi's treacherous acts of betraying the people, selling out the revolution, and strangling armed struggle have a long history.

As early as 1927, at a critical moment when the revolution and counter-revolution in China were engaged in a life-and-death struggle, the tyrant Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei successively betrayed the revolution. Under their plot, the reactionary Nationalist army carried out a bloody massacre of the Chinese revolutionary people. At that time, the capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, who usurped the position of head of the Hubei Provincial General Federation of Trade Unions, completely stood on the side of the reactionary Nationalist army, aided and abetted the evil, and openly ordered the dissolution of the Wuhan Workers' Patrol Corps. He handed over all the weapons of the Workers' Patrol Corps to the reactionary Nationalist army, not even leaving a single wooden stick from the Children's Corps. After handing over the guns, Liu Shaoqi shamelessly said, "Now that the arms have been disarmed and the guns have been handed over, I am at ease.... The danger is also smaller." This was Liu Shaoqi's first "harmonious cooperation" with the counter-revolutionaries!

In 1945, at a crucial moment when China faced two destinies and two futures, Liu Shaoqi again fervently advocated for a "peaceful democratic new stage," attempting to make our party hand over the people's revolutionary armed forces to Jiang Jieshi. He tried to integrate our army into the Nationalist "national army, national defense army, security forces, self-defense forces," and "unify" them under Jiang's "Ministry of Defense." This was his second "harmonious cooperation" with the reactionaries!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no revolutionary victory." "The people's arms, every gun, every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." Oppressed people who want to overthrow the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie and achieve their own liberation must take up arms and use revolutionary armed struggle to oppose reactionary armed struggle. Without the gun, the proletariat cannot seize power, and the laboring people will have no right to exist, no right to life, and can only be slaughtered at the whim of the reactionaries. The bitter lesson of the Indonesian revolutionary people, who suffered bloody suppression by the Indonesian reactionary right-wing military clique because they did not have a revolutionary armed force, is a vivid testament to this! Liu Shaoqi's "harmonious cooperation" with the reactionary military, opposing the people's armed revolutionary struggle, so that the counter-revolutionary armed forces can slaughter and suppress the people, completely proves that he is a henchman of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction!

Liu Shaoqi was so "harmonious" and "cooperative" with the tool of bourgeois dictatorship—the reactionary army; but he was terrified and hated the tool of proletarian dictatorship—the people's army. After national liberation, he used every means to push the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing to stubbornly implement the bourgeois military line, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, attempting to turn the people's army into a reactionary bourgeois army.

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The army is the main component of state power, an important factor in the struggle between restoration and anti-restoration, the center of the center, the key of the key. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, as long as the army does not change color, the color of the state will not change. We are the People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by the great commander Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Commander Lin. We are a people's army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We are the strong pillar of proletarian dictatorship. Liu Shaoqi's delusion of turning our red army into a tool for his restoration of capitalism will never succeed!

The film *Visit to Indonesia* is a poisonous weed carefully crafted by the great traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi to create a revolutionary atmosphere for his plots to usurp the party, usurp power, and usurp the military. However, after Great Leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing Liu Shaoqi to the judgment of history, this film became a shameful confession of his betrayal of the party and the country, and his selling out of the interests of the world's revolutionary people. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to deeply carry out the great criticism of the revolution, thoroughly criticize Liu the traitor and his *Visit to Indonesia*, and make them stink for ten thousand years!

    革命武装不可丢
    空军某部　张春熙　陶嘉善　马浩流
    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》，是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇充当帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的走狗的自供状。刘少奇学着苏联赫鲁晓夫的模样，在“访问”期间，干了很多叛党叛国、出卖社会主义和世界革命人民利益的罪恶勾当。他和双手沾满印尼革命人民鲜血的印尼右派军人集团头目勾勾搭搭，打得火热，再一次暴露他长期以来反对人民革命武装，妄图伙同反革命军队，以实现其反革命阴谋的狼子野心。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”
    人民军队是无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权的重要工具，资产阶级军队是资产阶级维护其反动统治、镇压劳动人民的工具。对于两种不同性质的军队的态度，是区别革命与反革命的一个分水岭。然而，披着“共产党员”外衣，打着“国家主席”招牌的刘少奇，在“访问”印尼的过程中，却肉麻地吹捧印尼反动军队是“实现印尼人民理想的”“革命工具”。在影片中，我们还看到刘少奇亲昵地和美帝国主义豢养的走狗、法西斯刽子手纳苏蒂安之流握手，并非常虔诚地祝愿他“保重身体”。在一次音乐会上，刘少奇竟然和这群杀人不眨眼的反动军人们一同弹奏竹制乐器“昂格隆”，公开表示他们之间“通力合作，和谐一致”！
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇吹捧反动的右派军人集团，抹煞资产阶级反动军队和人民革命武装的本质区别，他们那样地“和谐一致”，究竟要“通力合作”些什么呢？就是要麻痹人民斗志，解除人民革命武装，诱使人民走修正主义“议会道路”，俯首帖耳地听从资产阶级专政。
    刘少奇的这种背叛人民、出卖革命、扼杀武装斗争的罪恶勾当由来已久。
    早在一九二七年，我国革命与反革命展开殊死搏斗的严重时刻，独夫民贼蒋介石和汪精卫相继叛变革命，在他们的策划下，国民党反动军队血腥屠杀中国广大革命人民。当时，窃踞湖北省总工会负责人职务的大工贼刘少奇，完全站在国民党反动军队一边，助纣为虐，公然下令解散武汉工人纠察队，并把工人纠察队的全部武器拱手送给国民党反动军队，就连童子团的木棒也一根不留。交枪后，刘少奇还厚颜无耻地说：“现在把武装解除了，枪枝也交了，我也放心了，……危险也小了。”这就是刘少奇同反革命进行的一次“通力合作”！
    一九四五年，正当中国面临两种命运、两个前途的大决战的关键时刻，刘少奇又拚命鼓吹“和平民主新阶段”，妄图要我们党向蒋介石交出人民革命武装，妄图把我军编成国民党的“国军、国防军、保安队、自卫队”，“统一”于蒋匪的“国防部”。这是他同反动派进行的又一次“通力合作”！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”被压迫的人民要想推翻资产阶级的反动统治，获得自身的解放，就必须拿起枪杆子，用革命的武装，反对反革命的武装。离开了枪杆子，无产阶级就不可能夺取政权，也就没有劳动人民的生存权，生命权，就只能受反动派的任意宰割。印尼革命人民因为没有一支革命的武装，而遭到印尼反动的右派军人集团血腥镇压的惨痛教训，不正是雄辩地证实了这一点吗！刘少奇同反动军人“通力合作”，反对人民武装革命，以便反革命武装对人民进行屠杀和镇压，这就完完全全证明了他是帝、修、反的帮凶！
    刘少奇对资产阶级专政的工具——反动军队，是那么的“和谐一致”，那么的“通力合作”；对无产阶级专政的工具——人民军队，他则怕得要死，恨得要命。全国解放以后，他千方百计地通过反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，顽固地推行资产阶级军事路线，疯狂地对抗毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，妄图变人民军队为资产阶级反动军队。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”军队是国家政权的主要成份，是复辟和反复辟诸因素中的重要因素，是中心的中心，关键的关键。在无产阶级专政条件下，只要军队不变颜色，国家的颜色就不会变。我们是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造和亲自领导的、林副统帅直接指挥的人民解放军，是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。刘少奇妄图把我们这支红色军队蜕变成为他复辟资本主义工具的痴心妄想，是永远也不能得逞的！
    《访问印度尼西亚》这株大毒草，是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇为自己树碑立传、制造篡党、篡政、篡军的反革命舆论而精心炮制的。然而，当伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把刘少奇揪上了历史的审判台之后，这部影片便成了他叛党叛国、出卖世界革命人民利益的一篇可耻自供。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续深入地开展革命大批判，把刘贼和他的《访问印度尼西亚》批深批透，叫它遗臭万年！
