The Soviet revisionists, who have long since degenerated into social imperialists, have been strongly condemned and opposed by the revolutionary peoples of the world for their barefaced acts of aggression. They are now in an unprecedentedly awkward and isolated position. In order to cover up their ugly faces, these traitors have turned around and accused the great People's Republic of China of practicing "hegemonism." This trick of the thief crying "Stop thief!" is indeed the height of shamelessness!

In today's world, there are indeed hegemonists. American imperialism is one, and the Soviet revisionist clique is another. These two big bullies, like devils, collude with each other and at the same time vie with each other, attempting to redivide the world together. Not long ago, the Soviet revisionist clique and American imperialism, in their armed occupation of Czechoslovakia, staged a farce that fully exposed the ugly faces of these two bullies, who are colluding to redivide the world. This incident vividly depicted the hideous features of the Soviet hegemonists.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are attempting to redivide the world, colluding with each other and at the same time vying with each other. The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam has received the tacit approval and support of the Soviet revisionists, while the Soviet revisionist clique's open dispatch of troops to occupy Czechoslovakia has also received the tacit approval and support of the U.S. imperialists. Their dirty political deals have been thoroughly exposed to the people of the world."

For many years, it has been this clique of Soviet revisionists, in order to carry out their social imperialist policies, who have eagerly formed a counter-revolutionary alliance with American imperialism, zealously advocating that the two countries "solve the most complex international problems" and "decide the fate of mankind." Since the Glassboro talks, these two big bullies have become increasingly closely colluded. They tacitly support each other, help each other maintain their respective spheres of influence, and attempt to redivide the world. The recent incident of the Soviet revisionists' armed invasion of Czechoslovakia is an ironclad proof of the collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in dividing spheres of influence.

In order to maintain their shaky hegemony in Eastern Europe, the Soviet revisionists carried out a fascist military occupation of Czechoslovakia and forced the Czechoslovak revisionist clique to sign a humiliating treaty of surrender, allowing Soviet troops to occupy Czechoslovakia for a long time. All this was done with the tacit approval and support of the other big bully, American imperialism. Out of its counter-revolutionary global strategy, the U.S. imperialists, in the face of the Soviet revisionists' armed invasion of Czechoslovakia, turned a blind eye and adopted a so-called "hands-off" policy, saying they would "continue to strive" through various "agreements" to "move towards the goal of improving relations between the two countries," tacitly approving the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia and maintaining its hegemony in Eastern Europe, and using this to engage in dirty deals with the Soviet revisionists.

The Soviet revisionists, on the other hand, in order to gain U.S. imperialism's recognition of its hegemony in Eastern Europe, slavishly made a series of big concessions to American imperialism. The Soviet revisionist clique sent out a large number of officials, actively assuring the U.S. that they would not interfere in the U.S. imperialists' sphere of influence, expressing that "West Berlin will not be threatened by Eastern Europe," and asking the U.S. to rest assured. The Soviet revisionists sent their fleet into the Mediterranean, attempting to divide the Middle East with the U.S. and serve the U.S. imperialists' interests of aggression in the Middle East. The Soviet revisionist clique even went so far as to further betray the interests of the Vietnamese people, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and to help the U.S. imperialists realize their dream of permanently occupying South Vietnam.

The Soviet revisionists, like American imperialism, are shameless hegemonists and greedy bullies. However, the Soviet revisionists, with their shamelessness, actually claim that their armed invasion of Czechoslovakia is "in the interests of all socialist countries," and that the humiliating treaty of surrender they forced the Czechoslovak revisionist clique to sign is "strengthening the socialist camp worldwide." This is sheer nonsense. The Soviet invaders rampaging through a sovereign country, trampling on another country's territory, and claiming it is for the "security interests of the whole family of socialist countries"; the new tsars of the Kremlin, using tanks and cannons to force a small country to submit to their will, reducing an independent country to a colony, and claiming it is "strengthening the socialist camp." This is pure bully philosophy and sheer bandit logic.

The Soviet revisionist clique has already used its own claws to tear off all the disguises that deceived the people of the world. No matter how they beautify themselves and slander others, they can no longer cover up the hideous face of this big bully, who is colluding with American imperialism to attempt to redivide the world and conquer the globe.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Beginning with the intention to harm others, ending with harm to oneself. This is the law of development of all reactionary policies." The development of history has fully proven Chairman Mao's wise judgment. The policy of aggression of American imperialism is meeting with shameful failure, and the policy of social imperialism pursued by the Soviet hegemonists is increasingly arousing the indignant condemnation of the peoples of various countries, meeting with strong resistance from the peoples under the rule of the revisionist cliques, and playing a role in mobilizing the peoples of various countries to oppose the Soviet revisionist clique.

As pointed out by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Party: "There is no doubt that the wheel of history will not turn back, imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionary forces will inevitably be thoroughly smashed by the revolutionary peoples, and all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations in the world will certainly achieve thorough liberation in their struggles!"

    苏修是十足的霸权主义者
    装甲兵机关　永忠东
    早已堕落成社会帝国主义的苏修叛徒集团，由于他们赤裸裸的侵略行动遭到世界革命人民强烈的谴责和反对，处境空前狼狈和孤立。这伙叛徒为了想要掩饰自己的狰狞面目，竟然反口咬人，恶毒污蔑和攻击伟大的中国实行什么“霸权主义”。这种贼喊捉贼的伎俩，真是无耻之尤！
    在今天的世界上，霸权主义者是确实存在的。美帝国主义是一霸，苏修叛徒集团也是一霸。这两个大恶霸，象魔鬼一样，互相勾结，又互相争夺，妄图合伙重新瓜分世界。不久前，苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义围绕着武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克演出的一场大丑剧，就把美苏勾结、合伙瓜分世界的恶霸嘴脸暴露得淋漓尽致，活生生地勾划出了苏修霸权主义者的丑恶原形。
    党的第八届扩大的十二次中央全会公报指出：“美帝和苏修妄图重新瓜分世界，互相勾结，又互相争夺。美帝国主义对越南进行的侵略战争，得到了苏修的默契和支持，而苏修叛徒集团公开出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，也得到了美帝的默契和支持。他们这种肮脏的政治交易已经彻头彻尾地暴露在全世界人民的面前。”
    多年来，正是这伙苏修叛徒，为了推行它的社会帝国主义政策，极力同美帝国主义结成反革命同盟，狂热鼓吹什么苏美两国“解决最复杂的国际问题”，“决定人类命运”。从葛拉斯堡罗会谈以来，这两个大恶霸更是一步步紧密勾结起来。他们互相默契，互相支持。我承认你在这里的特权，你帮助我维持那里的统治，各自保持自己的势力范围，妄图把世界重新瓜分。不久以前发生的苏修叛徒武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克的事件，就是美、苏这两个大恶霸合伙划分势力范围的一个铁证。
    苏修叛徒为了保持它在东欧摇摇欲坠的霸权，对捷克斯洛伐克进行法西斯军事占领，并且用刺刀逼迫捷修集团签订了丧权辱国的卖国条约，使苏修军队可以长期占领捷克斯洛伐克。这一切都是在世界另一个大恶霸美帝国主义默许和支持下进行的。美帝出于其反革命全球战略的考虑，对于苏修武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克，睁一只眼，闭一只眼，采取所谓“不插手政策”，要“继续努力”通过各种“协议”“走向改善两国关系的目标”，对苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克、维护其东欧霸权表示默契，并以此同苏修进行肮脏交易。
    苏修叛徒呢？为了换取美帝承认其在东欧的霸权地位，奴颜婢膝地对美帝国主义作出了一系列大出卖。苏修叛徒集团派出大批官员，四出活动，极力向美帝保证不涉及美帝国主义的势力范围，表示西柏林“不会受到东欧的任何威胁”，叫美帝放心。苏修叛徒把他的舰队开进地中海，妄图同美帝一起瓜分中东，为美帝在中东的侵略利益服务。苏修叛徒集团还不惜进一步出卖越南人民的利益，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的烈火，帮助美帝国主义实现永远霸占越南南方的迷梦。
    苏修叛徒同美帝国主义一样，是十足的霸权主义者，是一个贪得无厌的大恶霸。然而，苏修竟然死不要脸，硬把它对捷克斯洛伐克的武装侵略说成是什么“符合一切社会主义国家的利益”，把逼迫捷修集团签订的卖国条约，说成是什么“加强社会主义在全世界的阵地”，真是荒谬透顶。苏修的侵略军队在一个主权国家横冲直闯，践踏别国的领土，还说是为“大家庭各国安全的利益”；克里姆林宫的新沙皇，用坦克、大炮，胁迫一个小国听命于自己的意志，使一个独立国家沦为殖民地，还要说成是“加强社会主义阵地”。这是地地道道的恶霸哲学，彻头彻尾的强盗逻辑。
    苏修叛徒集团已经用自己的魔爪，撕掉了欺骗世界人民的种种遮羞布，不管他们怎样美化自己，污蔑别人，再也掩盖不了这个一心一意伙同美帝妄图重新瓜分世界、霸占全球的大恶霸的狰狞面孔了。
    伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。这将是一切反动政策的发展规律。”历史的发展完全证明了毛主席这一英明论断。美帝国主义的侵略政策正在遭到可耻的破产，苏修霸权主义者推行的社会帝国主义政策也越来越激起各国人民的愤怒谴责，遭到修正主义集团统治下的各国人民的强烈反抗，起着动员各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团的作用。
    正如党的第八届扩大的第十二次中央全会公报所指出的：“毫无疑问，历史前进的车轮是不会倒转的，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动势力必然要被革命人民彻底粉碎，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族，都必将在自己的斗争中得到彻底翻身！”
