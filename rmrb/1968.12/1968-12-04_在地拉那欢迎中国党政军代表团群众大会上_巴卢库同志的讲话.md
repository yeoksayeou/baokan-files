The full text of Comrade Beqir Balluku's speech at the mass rally in Tirana welcoming the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation is as follows:

Dear Comrade Huang Yongsheng,
Dear members of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation,
Dear Comrades,

The workers of the capital and the Tirana garrison are very pleased to participate in this grand gathering that embodies the combat friendship between Albania and China, and to warmly welcome the closest comrades-in-arms from the great People's Republic of China led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army of China.

Please allow me to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and all the personnel of the armed forces, our deep, sincere, fraternal, and revolutionary friendship to the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation, to the 700 million Chinese people, to the glorious Communist Party of China, to the great leader of the Chinese people and our dearest friend, Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the invincible fortress of socialism and revolution in the world—the heroic People's Liberation Army of China.

On the joyous days of our great national holidays, when our people, in a high revolutionary spirit, are advancing to celebrate these great holidays with their great achievements in building and defending socialism in all fields, we are happy and proud to have our dear friends, our comrades-in-arms, the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation with us.

The visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng to participate in our national celebrations on November 28 and 29 fully embodies the great combat friendship between our two countries. The participation of the Chinese delegation is a great contribution to further strengthening and deepening the fraternal friendship between the peoples of our two socialist-building countries, our two Marxist-Leninist parties, and our two proletarian armies. It is a great honor for our people, our Party, our government, and our army. That is why, when the workers, peasants, and soldiers from various places met with the delegation members, they once again expressed their respect and love for the fraternal Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the unbreakable revolutionary combat friendship between our two countries.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people have worked selflessly, and in the nineteen years since the establishment of the people's government, the great People's Republic of China has become a true giant of socialism. It possesses modern industry, advanced agriculture, proletarian culture and education, and very advanced science and technology. It has an invincible defensive power and a powerful proletarian army equipped with the most perfect means of combat.

The great China of Mao Zedong is the motherland of two great world-shaking revolutions of historic significance. One is the great people's revolution of China, which, following the great October Socialist Revolution led by Lenin and Stalin in Russia, dealt a heavy blow to the bloodthirsty world imperialist system; the other is the first proletarian cultural revolution, which defeated the evil plot of the world reactionaries, headed by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, to restore capitalism in China.

The proletarian cultural revolution in China has thoroughly shattered the dreams of the world reactionaries to prevent the proletarian socialist revolution from advancing rapidly in China and throughout the world. This is a profound political and ideological revolution, unprecedented in history, carried out under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship according to the great strategic deployment of Comrade Mao Zedong.

Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, workers, peasants, and intellectuals, resolutely defend and implement the thoughts of Chairman Mao, and are conducting and will continue to conduct fierce class struggles. They have exposed and smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, the mad enemy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and a faithful lackey of imperialism and revisionism. Liu Shaoqi and his agents had attempted to usurp the leadership of the Party, government, and army. This imperialist-revisionist plot has been smashed, marking the decisive victory of proletarian dictatorship and socialism over revisionism and capitalism, ensuring that the People's Republic of China will forever remain red and a great fortress of socialism and world proletarian revolution.

The establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China, except Taiwan Province, marks the complete victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's line and his revolutionary line over the counter-revolutionary line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi. This great victory has presented a revolutionary scene unprecedented in the entire country, mobilizing the whole of China, creating an irresistible momentum of advance, and forever marching forward on the road to socialism and communism.

At present, the basic feature of the domestic situation in the People's Republic of China is the great unity of the 700 million Chinese people, who are united around the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, as firm as a rock in spirit and politics. This iron-like unity, based on Marxist-Leninist principles and the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, is the source of all the victories that the fraternal Chinese people have achieved and will achieve in the future. The fraternal Chinese people are united as one, proudly and invincibly advancing on the road of continuous revolution.

The proletarian cultural revolution has made the People's Republic of China a great school of class education and political and ideological education, where hundreds of millions of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers are studying with great enthusiasm and unswervingly implementing the teachings and instructions of their teacher, Chairman Mao, to best complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the new stage of the revolution, strengthen the leadership of the working class in the proletarian cultural revolution and in the socialist construction of the country, and further advance the revolutionization of education, culture, and other fields.

In this great class struggle, the People's Liberation Army of China has made tremendous contributions. The People's Liberation Army of China is a strong and reliable pillar of the proletarian cultural revolution and proletarian dictatorship in China. The revolutionary soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China fully support and support the Party's revolutionary line, and with their heroic spirit, have written a glorious chapter in the history of the proletarian cultural revolution. They have become a great force inspiring all Chinese revolutionary cadres.

The People's Liberation Army of China, as the fighting force of the Party and proletarian dictatorship, is an army personally cultivated and led by Chairman Mao, tempered in the fierce class struggles against the domestic and foreign enemies of the Chinese people, a new type of proletarian army, a reliable defender of the socialist motherland and the revolutionary cause, making the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionists led by the Khrushchev traitor group tremble with fear.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made important resolutions, exposing the traitor Liu Shaoqi and expelling him from the Party forever. This is the decisive battle between the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong and the counter-revolutionary line of the revisionist group attempting to lead the People's Republic of China onto the capitalist road of change.

All Communist Party members, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in China have welcomed these important resolutions with indescribable enthusiasm. They are now fighting to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and instructions on worker-class leadership, on strengthening proletarian dictatorship in all aspects, on revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, on carrying out revolutionary great criticism, and on streamlining organizations. Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and instructions ensure the final victory of the proletarian cultural revolution and the continued advancement of the socialist revolution in the People's Republic of China.

The smooth progress and excellent situation of the proletarian cultural revolution have already and are continuing to bring the thoughts and creativity of the talented Chinese working people to unprecedented leaps and bounds, arouse and enhance proletarian consciousness, promote the rapid development of productive forces and science and technology, increase production, and continuously strengthen the defensive power of the People's Republic of China.

The proletarian cultural revolution is not only of great significance to China but also to the peoples of all countries in the world. This revolution, for the revolutionary and national liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and reactionaries, for the development of Marxist-Leninist forces and the enhancement of proletarian consciousness in revisionist countries to overthrow the ruling revisionist groups and restore proletarian dictatorship, has had and is having an increasingly greater impact. That is why the modern revisionists led by the Khrushchev group have, in the past and present, spared no effort in the most vile slander, extortion, and rumor-mongering to oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's correct Marxist-Leninist line and deny the glorious victories of the proletarian cultural revolution. However, the proletarian cultural revolution has achieved and is achieving great victories, and the People's Republic of China is advancing by leaps and bounds. No force in the world, now or in the future, can in the slightest prevent the People's Republic of China from advancing victoriously towards socialism and communism.

The great Chinese people possess atomic and hydrogen weapons, which greatly enhance the defensive power of the People's Republic of China and deal a heavy blow to the blackmail and nuclear monopoly of imperialism and revisionism. The nuclear weapons in the hands of the great Chinese people, who are firmly walking the socialist road, are the weapons in the hands of all revolutionary peoples of the world. The People's Republic of China is the strongest fortress of socialism and revolution. The achievements of the People's Republic of China are the achievements of all revolutionary peoples of the world. Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "Especially in the current situation, the existence of a powerful, revolutionary People's Republic of China, a great Communist Party of China that is steadfast in Marxism-Leninism and its outstanding leader Comrade Mao Zedong, is a great fortune for the peoples of the world and their freedom, world peace, Marxism-Leninism, and the future of socialism."

The Albanian people, as the closest comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, are greatly pleased with the great victories achieved by the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong in all aspects of socialist construction.

From the very beginning, our people and the Party of Labour of Albania have fully supported the proletarian cultural revolution in China and welcomed the historic resolutions of the Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. We are genuinely happy with the great victories achieved by the Communist Party of China and the fraternal Chinese people, as well as with the bright prospects facing the People's Republic of China. Our Party and our people regard these victories as their own victories and the victories of all revolutionary peoples of the world.

Comrades,

We are at a moment when the international situation is developing in a direction favorable to the peoples and revolution, and unfavorable to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces.

More and more people are rising up to fight for justice, and the revolutionary storms against imperialism led by the United States, against modern revisionism led by the Khrushchev group, and against other reactionary forces are surging. Especially, the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are erupting like volcanoes. In the great class struggle, the proletariat of capitalist and revisionist countries is strengthening its struggle to establish and restore proletarian dictatorship, and Marxist-Leninist forces are being strengthened and consolidated through this struggle.

The Marxist-Leninist theory of struggle and armed revolution, the history of struggles that have taken place, and the reality of the struggles for national and social liberation that are taking place are increasingly convincing the peoples and revolutionaries of various countries that only with guns can they seize power from the ruling bourgeoisie and revisionist groups, and only through armed uprisings and class struggles in all fields at home and abroad can they achieve true freedom and ensure the development of the socialist revolution. The armed national liberation struggles of the peoples of many countries against the oppression and exploitation of imperialism are clearly showing that the peoples of various countries, regardless of the "sacred alliance" of the United States and the Soviet Union and their plots, blackmail, and brainwashing propaganda, are advancing on the road to victory, on the road to freedom, independence, and socialism.

In the current situation of thriving revolution, when both imperialism and revisionism are facing deep and numerous antagonistic contradictions and suffering consecutive defeats, the cooperation of the two world policemen, the United States and the Soviet Union, is expanding in scope and colluding with each other to plot against the peoples of various countries. Due to this collusion aimed at dividing spheres of influence and dominating the world, the freedom and national sovereignty of all countries are being threatened.

The main goal of the Soviet-American alliance is based on the strategy of encircling the People's Republic of China and establishing bases for invading the People's Republic of China, because the great revolutionary China is the main insurmountable obstacle to their plan to dominate the world.

However, the great China of Mao Zedong, tempered in the fierce class struggles for national liberation and in the proletarian cultural revolution, today possesses such economic and military power that it can break and shatter all the encirclements of imperialism and revisionism, these enemies. The heroic People's Liberation Army of China, cultivated and led by the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and commanded by his closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is vigilantly defending its glorious motherland and is ready at any time to decisively smash any invader from any direction.

The plots of the United States and the Soviet Union to force the heroic Vietnamese people to surrender aim not only to make the U.S. occupation of South Vietnam permanent but also, first and foremost, to turn South Vietnam into a large-scale base of aggression against socialist China and against the peoples of Asia fighting for freedom and independence. The undeniable victories won by the heroic Vietnamese people in their long armed struggle for liberation and against U.S. imperialism have been betrayed by the Soviet revisionists. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, in their planned imperialist schemes, have already turned the cause of freedom and independence of South Vietnam into a bargaining chip in their plans. With the active assistance of the Soviet revisionists, the U.S. imperialists are trying to extinguish the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people through so-called peace talks, to force them to surrender, and to obtain in the negotiating room what they cannot obtain on the battlefield. However, we believe that the fraternal Vietnamese people will not be deceived by the plots of the imperialists and revisionists and will continue their armed struggle until they achieve complete victory.

The Soviet revisionist traitor group, facing consecutive defeats at home and abroad, has moved from deceiving with the signboard of "socialist countries" to the stage of openly invading its own allies. Its fascist invasion of Czechoslovakia under the infamous banner of the Warsaw Pact not only indicates the great intensification of contradictions within the revisionist camp but also indicates the common strategic line adopted by the imperialist-revisionist alliance of the United States and the Soviet Union to divide the world into spheres of influence, strengthen control over their allies, and issue orders. The actions taken by the Soviets under the banner of the Warsaw Pact are no different from the actions taken by the Americans under their imperialist treaties of aggression. The action of the People's Republic of Albania to withdraw from this infamous pact once again demonstrates our Party's steadfast Marxist-Leninist principles, and our Party, with its correct line, has defended and will continue to defend the interests of our country and the interests of all revolutionary peoples of the world. The 700 million Chinese people and all true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries in the world have strongly supported and supported the courageous and revolutionary action of the Party and people of Albania.

The historic telegrams sent by Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai to Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mehmet Shehu at the time of our country's withdrawal from this pact once again demonstrated the power of unity between our two parties and our two peoples and the power of revolutionary combat friendship.

Comrades,

A few days ago, all the people of our country, in a high political enthusiasm and an indescribable atmosphere of revolutionary mobilization, celebrated the great holidays with great achievements. All the people of our country summed up the brilliant victories achieved in the twenty-four years of free life under the wise leadership of the glorious Party of Labour headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha. The Albanian people, united as one, are steel-like united around their Party of Labour, holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, and are resolutely fighting with unshakable confidence and revolutionary optimism to fully implement the historic resolutions of our glorious Party's Fifth Congress: to develop and deepen the ideological and cultural revolution; to educate the working people with the great thoughts of Marxism-Leninism, the glorious history of the Party of Labour of Albania, and the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, thus putting politics in the first place; to further strengthen the leadership of the working class; to revolutionize the entire life of the state; and to strengthen our socialist motherland's defensive power in all aspects.

Our people are more united than ever around the Party of Labour, working calmly, full of confidence in their bright future, standing ready to give a crushing and destructive response to any enemy or any united enemy who dares to touch our dear motherland, whether they are imperialists or revisionists.

We are proud that our people and our Party, in their heroic struggle to defend and achieve the victory of Marxism-Leninism, for the great cause of revolution and socialism, have forged a steel-like unity with the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China, and are advancing shoulder to shoulder.

Our great and eternal friendship has been tempered in the fiery struggle against imperialism and revisionism by the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party of Labour of Albania headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha. Our eternal, revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist friendship has been tested in the fierce and principled struggle of our two peoples, our two parties, and our two peoples' armies against imperialism and modern revisionism, and has shown its strength and vitality in both good and difficult times. Our two peoples and our two armies are true allies and inseparable comrades-in-arms, and they will fight in the same trench at any time and in any situation to repel the common enemy, and they will continue to advance side by side in the construction of socialism and communism, and they will advance bravely in the stormy waves, striving for the final victory of socialism and communism. Although our two countries are geographically distant from each other, the common ideal and Marxism-Leninism bind us together, forming a steel-like unity, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in his telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania: "Though we are separated by the sea, we are as close as neighbors."

The recent visit of our Party, Government, and Economic Delegation to the People's Republic of China, the very friendly and cordial talks held during the visit, and the warm welcome extended to the two delegations by the great Chinese people are a powerful expression of the revolutionary friendship and proletarian internationalist cooperation between our two countries and parties, and have made a great contribution to strengthening this friendship and cooperation. The various agreements signed by our Government Economic Delegation during the visit are new great examples of proletarian internationalism, embodying our friendship and the great assistance to our socialist construction.

Please allow me to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Government of Albania, and the people, our deepest gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and its great leader, our dearest friend Comrade Mao Zedong, for the great, generous, and selfless assistance they have given and are giving to our people.

The current visit of the Chinese Party, Government, and Military Delegation to our country once again embodies the great friendship between our two peoples and our two armies. Our talks with the Chinese comrades have been completely consistent in views and actions on all the issues discussed. We are confident that this visit will help to further develop and strengthen the friendly relations and fraternal ties between our two peoples, our two parties, and our two armies, to the benefit of the struggle to defend the great cause of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and world revolution.

Long live the unbreakable, eternal revolutionary friendship and combat unity between our two peoples, our two parties, and our two armies!

Long live the heroic 700 million Chinese people!

Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, the most respected and beloved friend of the Albanian people, the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the heroic People's Liberation Army of China!

Long live the complete victory of the proletarian cultural revolution in China!

Long live the Party of Labour of Albania headed by our beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Glory to the invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    在地拉那欢迎中国党政军代表团群众大会上
    巴卢库同志的讲话
    新华社地拉那二日电　贝基尔·巴卢库同志在地拉那欢迎中国党政军代表团群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的黄永胜同志，亲爱的中国党政军代表团同志们，亲爱的同志们：
    首都工人和地拉那驻军为参加这次体现阿中战斗友谊的盛大的集会，热烈欢迎来自毛泽东的伟大的人民中国的最亲密的战友——由中国共产党中央委员、中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜同志率领的中国党政军代表团而感到十分高兴。
    请允许我借这个机会，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和武装部队的全体人员，向中国党政军代表团，向七亿中国人民，向光荣的中国共产党，向中国人民的伟大领袖和我国人民最亲爱的朋友毛泽东同志，向全世界社会主义和革命的坚不可摧的堡垒——英雄的中国人民解放军，表达我们深厚的、真诚的、兄弟般的、革命的友好感情。
    在我国伟大节日的欢乐的日子里，当我国人民在崇高的革命热情的气氛中，以他们在建设和保卫社会主义的各个方面所取得的伟大成就向前迈进，迎接这些伟大节日的时候，我们以有我们亲爱的朋友、我们的战友、中国党政军代表团同我们在一起而感到高兴和自豪。
    黄永胜同志率领的中国党政军代表团前来参加我们十一月二十八日和二十九日的全国性节日活动，充分体现了阿中两国的伟大的战斗友谊。中国党政军代表团的参加，是对进一步加强和加深我们建设社会主义的两国人民、我们两个马克思列宁主义政党和我们两支无产阶级军队之间的兄弟般的友谊的巨大贡献，是我国人民、我们党、我国政府和我国军队的莫大光荣。正因为这样，当各地的工农兵同代表团成员会见的时候，再次表达了他们对兄弟的中国人民、对光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志、以及对我们两国之间的牢不可破的革命的战斗友谊的尊敬和热爱。
    由于天才的中国人民在杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的正确领导下进行了忘我的劳动，伟大的人民中国在建立人民政权后的十九年来，已经成为真正的社会主义的巨人，她拥有现代工业、先进农业和无产阶级的文化教育，具有非常先进的科学技术，具有坚不可摧的防御力量和拥有一支掌握最完善的战斗手段的无产阶级强大的军队。
    毛泽东的伟大的中国，是两次震撼世界的具有历史意义的伟大革命的祖国。一次是中国的伟大人民革命，这次革命继列宁和斯大林领导的俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，给了嗜血成性的世界帝国主义体系以最沉重的打击；另一次是首次无产阶级文化大革命，这次革命击败了以美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义为首的世界反动派妄图在中国复辟资本主义的凶恶阴谋。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底打破了世界反动派阻止无产阶级社会主义革命在中国和全世界向前迅猛发展的妄想。这是一次按照毛泽东同志的伟大战略部署、在无产阶级专政条件下进行的、史无前例的深刻的政治和思想革命。
    亿万革命群众、工农兵和人民知识分子，坚决捍卫和贯彻执行毛泽东主席的思想，进行了并且正在进行激烈的阶级斗争，他们揭露和摧毁了以中国共产党和中国人民的疯狂敌人、帝国主义的和修正主义的忠实走狗刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，刘少奇及其代理人曾企图篡夺党政军的领导。这个帝国主义—修正主义的阴谋被摧毁，标志着无产阶级专政和社会主义对修正主义和资本主义取得了决定性的胜利，这就使得中华人民共和国永远是红色的，永远是社会主义和世界无产阶级革命的巨大堡垒。
    中国除台湾省外，全国各省、市、自治区革命委员会的建立，标志着毛泽东同志的思想和他的革命路线对叛徒刘少奇的反革命路线的全面胜利。这一巨大的胜利使整个中国呈现出一片前所未有的革命景象，使整个中国动员起来了，形成锐不可挡的跃进局面，在社会主义和共产主义的道路上永远奋勇前进。
    目前，中华人民共和国的国内形势的基本特点，是团结在共产党和毛泽东同志周围的七亿中国人民在精神上和政治上的坚如磐石的伟大团结。建立在马克思列宁主义原则的基础之上、建立在毛泽东同志的思想的基础之上的这种钢铁般的团结，是兄弟的中国人民在目前已经取得以及今后将要取得的一切胜利的源泉，兄弟的中国人民团结得象一个人一样，自豪地和战无不胜地在不断革命的道路上向前迈进。
    无产阶级文化大革命已使中华人民共和国成为一所阶级教育以及政治和思想教育的大学校，在这所大学校里，亿万工农兵革命群众，正在以极大的热情学习和坚持不渝地贯彻自己的导师毛泽东主席的教导和指示，以便最好地完成革命新阶段的斗、批、改任务，加强工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中和在国家的社会主义建设中的领导作用，以及把教育、文化等领域里的革命化进一步推向前进。
    在这场伟大的阶级斗争中，中国人民解放军作出了巨大的贡献，中国人民解放军是中国无产阶级文化大革命和无产阶级专政的强大和可靠的支柱。中国人民解放军的革命战士完全拥护和支持党的革命路线，以自己的英雄气概，在无产阶级文化大革命的历史上写下了光辉的篇章。他们已成为鼓舞所有中国无产阶级革命派的一支巨大的力量。
    中国人民解放军作为党和无产阶级专政的战斗队，是毛泽东主席亲自培育和领导的，是在为反对中国人民的国内外敌人而进行的激烈阶级斗争烈火中经过千锤百炼的军队，是一支新型的无产阶级军队，是社会主义祖国和革命事业的可靠捍卫者，它使以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者和以苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者怕得要死。
    中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会作出了重要决议，揭露了叛徒刘少奇并把他永远开除出党，这是毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义革命路线同企图使人民中国走上资本主义演变邪路的修正主义集团的反革命路线的决战。
    中国全体共产党员、所有革命群众和人民解放军战士以难以形容的热情欢呼这些重要的决议，现在他们正在为贯彻执行毛泽东同志关于实行工人阶级领导、关于在各个方面不断加强无产阶级专政、关于革命大联合和革命三结合、关于开展革命的大批判以及关于精简机构的教导和指示而斗争。毛泽东同志的这些教导和指示确保无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利，确保中华人民共和国的社会主义革命继续进行下去并不断向前发展。
    无产阶级文化大革命的顺利发展及其大好形势，已经并且正在继续使天才的中国劳动人民的思想和创造力达到前所未有的突飞猛进的境界，激发和提高无产阶级的觉悟，促进生产力以及科学和技术的迅猛发展，增加生产和不断增强中华人民共和国的防御力量。
    无产阶级文化大革命，不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界各国人民都具有重大的意义。这场革命对于世界各国人民为反对帝国主义和反动派而进行的革命和民族解放斗争，对于发展马克思列宁主义力量和提高修正主义国家的工人阶级的觉悟，以便推翻当权的修正主义集团和重建无产阶级专政，已经发生和正在发生越来越大的影响。正因为这样，以赫鲁晓夫集团为首的现代修正主义者，过去和现在都竭尽最卑鄙的诬蔑、讹诈和造谣之能事，来反对毛泽东主席的正确的马克思列宁主义路线和否定无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。但是无产阶级文化大革命取得了和正在取得伟大的胜利，中华人民共和国正在突飞猛进。不论是现在或将来，世界上任何力量都不能丝毫阻止人民中国胜利地走向社会主义和共产主义。
    伟大的中国人民拥有原子武器和氢武器，这大大地增强了中华人民共和国的防御能力，并给予帝国主义和修正主义的讹诈和核垄断以沉重的打击。坚定地走社会主义道路的伟大的中国人民手中掌握的核武器，就是全世界全体革命人民手中掌握的武器。人民中国是社会主义和革命的最强大的堡垒。人民中国的成就就是世界上全体革命人民的成就。恩维尔·霍查同志说：“特别是在当前的形势下，有强大的、革命的中华人民共和国，战斗的、忠实于马克思列宁主义的不屈不挠的伟大的中国共产党及其卓越的领袖毛泽东同志，这是世界人民及其自由、世界和平、马克思列宁主义和社会主义的前途的巨大幸运。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民作为中国人民的最亲密的战友，对于人民中国在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个方面所取得的伟大胜利，感到莫大的喜悦。
    我国人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党从一开始就全力支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命，并欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会所作出的具有历史意义的决议。我们对中国共产党和兄弟的中国人民所取得的伟大胜利以及对展现在中华人民共和国面前的光辉前景，感到由衷的高兴。我们的党和我国人民把这些胜利看作是自己的胜利，看作是全世界全体革命人民的胜利。
    同志们：
    我们正处在这样一个时刻：国际形势正在朝着有利于各国人民和革命而不利于帝国主义、修正主义和反动势力的方向发展。
    越来越多的人民群众奋起投入正义斗争，反对以美国为首的帝国主义、反对以赫鲁晓夫集团为首的现代修正主义以及反对其他反动势力的革命风暴正在汹涌澎湃。尤其是，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放斗争，正在象火山一样爆发起来。在阶级大搏斗中，资本主义国家的和修正主义国家的无产阶级为建立和重建无产阶级专政所进行的斗争正在加强，马克思列宁主义力量通过这场斗争正在得到增强和巩固。
    马克思列宁主义关于斗争和武装革命的学说，已经进行的斗争历史以及正在为争取民族和社会解放的斗争现实，越来越使各国人民和革命者确信，只有用枪炮才能够从当权的资产阶级和修正主义集团手中夺取政权，只有通过武装起义和通过国内外一切领域里的阶级斗争，才能够取得真正的自由和保证社会主义革命的发展。世界上许多国家中的人民为反对帝国主义的压迫和剥削而正在不断加紧进行的民族解放武装斗争清楚地表明，各国人民不顾什么美苏的“神圣同盟”以及它们的阴谋、讹诈和蛊惑人心的宣传，正在胜利的道路上，正在自由、独立和社会主义的道路上向前迈进。
    在目前革命蓬勃发展的形势下，正当帝国主义和修正主义都面临着深刻的重重对抗性矛盾和遭到接连不断的失败的时候，美苏这两个世界宪兵的合作正在扩大范围，互相勾结，阴谋反对各国人民。由于这两个大国目的在于划分势力范围和主宰世界的这种勾结，世界各国的自由和国家主权正在受到威胁。
    苏美联盟的主要目标，是以包围中华人民共和国和建立侵略中华人民共和国的基地这一战略为基础的，因为伟大的革命的中国是它们实现主宰世界的计划的主要的不可逾越的障碍。
    但是，在争取民族解放的阶级斗争的激烈搏斗中和在无产阶级文化大革命中得到了锤炼的毛泽东的伟大中国，今天已经拥有这样的经济和军事力量，她能够打破和粉碎帝国主义和修正主义这些敌人的一切包围。伟大领袖毛泽东同志培育起来的、由他的最亲密的战友林彪副主席指挥的英雄的中国人民解放军警惕地保卫着自己的光荣的祖国，它随时准备好坚决粉碎不论来自何方的任何侵略者。
    美苏两国所策划的企图使英雄的越南人民屈膝投降的阴谋，其目的不仅在于使美国对越南南方的占领永久继续下去，而且首先在于使越南南方变成矛头指向社会主义的中国、指向为自由和独立而斗争的亚洲各国人民的一个大型的侵略桥头堡。英雄的越南人民在争取解放、抗击美帝国主义的长期武装斗争中所赢得的不容置疑的胜利，已被苏联修正主义者出卖了。美帝和苏修在他们所策划的帝国主义计划和阴谋中，已经把越南南方的自由和独立事业变成它们作交易的一个目标。在苏修的积极效劳之下，美帝力图通过所谓的和谈来扑灭越南人民的英勇斗争，使他们屈膝投降，并在谈判桌上捞到它在战场上不能得到的东西。但是，我们相信，兄弟的越南人民不会受帝、修策划的阴谋的欺骗，必将把武装斗争继续进行下去，直到取得彻底的胜利。
    苏修叛徒集团面对着在国内外接连遭到的失败，已经从以“社会主义国家”这块招牌进行欺骗，进入了首先是对自己的盟国发动公开侵略的阶段。它在华沙条约的臭名远扬的旗号下面对捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯侵略，不仅表明了修正主义阵营内部重重矛盾的大大加剧，而且表明了苏美帝国主义—修正主义联盟为在世界上划分势力范围，对自己的盟国加强控制和发号施令而采取共同的战略路线。苏联人利用华沙条约的旗号所采取的行动，同美国人利用他们的帝国主义侵略条约所采取的行动，没有丝毫区别。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出这个臭名昭著的条约的行动，再一次表明了我们党的坚定不移的马克思列宁主义原则立场，我们党以自己的正确路线，过去和现在不仅保卫了我们国家的利益，而且也保卫了全世界革命人民的利益。七亿中国人民以及全世界所有真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命者都强有力地支持和声援了阿尔巴尼亚党和人民的这一勇敢和革命的行动。
    毛泽东主席、林彪同志和周恩来同志在我国退出这个条约的时候给恩维尔·霍查同志和穆罕默德·谢胡同志发来的有历史意义的电报，再一次体现了我们两党和我们两国人民之间的团结的威力和革命的战斗友谊的威力。
    同志们：
    几天之前，我国全体人民，在高度的政治热情和难以形容的革命动员的气氛中，以巨大的成绩隆重地庆祝了伟大节日。我国全体人民总结了在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的劳动党的英明领导下，在二十四年来的自由生活中所取得的辉煌胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民，同心同德，钢铁般地团结在自己的劳动党的周围，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，以不可动摇的信心和革命乐观主义坚决地进行斗争，来全面贯彻执行我们光荣的党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议：发展和深入开展思想文化革命；用马克思列宁主义的伟大思想、用阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的光荣历史、用恩维尔·霍查同志的学说教育劳动人民，从而把政治放在第一位；进一步加强工人阶级的领导作用；使国家的整个生活革命化；多方面加强我们社会主义祖国的防御力量。
    我国人民比以往任何时候更加紧密地团结在劳动党的周围，沉着地进行劳动，他们对自己的光辉的未来满怀信心，他们严阵以待，随时准备给敢于碰一碰我们亲爱的祖国的任何敌人或任何联合的敌人以应有的、毁灭性的回击，不管他们是帝国主义者还是修正主义者。
    我们感到骄傲的是，我国人民和我们的党在为捍卫和争取马克思列宁主义的胜利、为革命的和社会主义的伟大事业所进行的英勇斗争中，我们同伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党结成钢铁般的团结，并肩前进。
    我们之间的伟大的和永恒的友谊，是在反帝反修的斗争烈火中，由以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党锤炼而成的。我们之间的永恒的、革命的、马克思列宁主义的友谊，在我们两国人民、两党和两国人民军队为反对帝国主义和现代修正主义而进行的坚决的原则性斗争中经受了严峻的考验，无论在顺利的日子里还是在困难的日子里，都表现出了它的力量和生命力。我们两国人民和两国军队是真正的盟友和不可分离的战友，他们将在任何时候和在任何情况下都在同一条战壕里为抗击共同的敌人而战斗，他们将在社会主义和共产主义的建设中一如既往地并肩前进，他们将在大风大浪中勇往直前，争取社会主义和共产主义的最后胜利。尽管我们两国之间在地理上相隔遥远，但是共同的理想和马克思列宁主义把我们联结在一起，结成了钢铁般的团结，正如毛泽东同志在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中所说的：“海内存知己，天涯若比邻。”
    我国党政代表团和政府经济代表团最近对中华人民共和国的访问，在访问期间所进行的非常亲切和友好的会谈，伟大的中国人民对两个代表团的热烈欢迎，是我们两国和两党之间的革命友谊和国际主义的兄弟般的合作的强有力的表现，并为加强这种友谊和合作作出了重大的贡献。我国政府经济代表团在访问期间所缔结的各项协定，是体现了我们之间的友谊、体现了对我国社会主义建设的巨大援助的无产阶级国际主义的新的伟大榜样。
    请允许我借此机会代表阿尔巴尼亚党中央、阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民，对兄弟的中国人民、中国共产党、中国政府及其伟大领袖、我国人民最亲爱的朋友毛泽东同志过去和现在给予我国人民的巨大的、慷慨的和无私的援助，表示最深切的谢意。
    中国党政军代表团目前对我国的访问，又一次体现了我们两国人民和两国军队之间的伟大友谊。我们同中国同志们的会谈，对所讨论的一切问题，在看法上和行动上始终是完全一致的。我们深信，这次访问将有助于在各方面进一步发展和加强我们两国人民、我们两党和我们两国军队之间的友好关系和兄弟般的联系，以有利于保卫马克思列宁主义、社会主义和世界革命的伟大事业的斗争。
    我们两国人民、我们两党和我们两国军队之间的牢不可破的、永恒的革命友谊和战斗团结万岁！
    英雄的七亿中国人民万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最敬爱的和最亲爱的朋友、伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志万岁！
    英雄的中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！
    以我们的党和我国人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    光荣属于战无不胜的马克思列宁主义！
