Chairman, fellow delegates:

After listening to the reports from the leaders, I have an even clearer understanding of the great leap forward in our country. We fully agree with these reports. Since 1958, when the Party put forward the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, everything in our country has become more prosperous. Here, I would like to report to the conference on the situation in our hometown, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, which achieved the agricultural development program's grain target eight years ahead of schedule.

In order to strive for the early realization of the agricultural development program's grain target, the county party committee proposed in 1956 to "transform the Taihang Mountains into Jiangnan and turn the high mountains and thin land into granaries." They called a grain yield of 400 jin per mu "crossing the Yellow River" and a yield of 800 jin per mu "crossing the Yangtze River." At first, not to mention "crossing the Yangtze River," some people even doubted whether they could "cross the Yellow River." Just four years later, in 1959, our county achieved the agricultural development program's grain yield target of 400 jin per mu, eight years ahead of the scheduled 1967. Our county's more than 200,000 mu of autumn and summer fields yielded an average of 402.5 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 60% compared to 1955 before the implementation of the agricultural development program, and an increase of 26.1% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Such a great leap forward had never happened before. How could it not make everyone happy and celebrate?

Fellow delegates, why were we able to achieve the agricultural development program's grain target eight years ahead of schedule? Below, I will talk about this issue.

Great Battle of "Hundred-Li Beach"

Let's start with harnessing mountains and rivers and the great battle of "Hundred-Li Beach." As everyone knows, our Taihang Mountains were originally a place with large mountains and few rivers, thick rocks and thin soil. Pingshun has two dry river beaches, a full hundred li long. The uneven mountain land on both sides of the river was terraced by human labor. People often said: "Droughts, floods, wind, and snow occur every year, and crops fail nine years out of ten." Hearing this, you know that this place is an old low-yield "bottom of the pot." With mutual aid groups and agricultural cooperatives, the situation changed. Relying on collective strength, we harnessed mountains and rivers, fought against the poor mountains and bad waters, and increased grain production. However, the land had not yet been greatly "turned over," and there was no guarantee that the yield would continue to increase steadily. In order to strive for these terraces to "cross the Yellow River" and "cross the Yangtze River" ahead of schedule, in the past few years, we cut and filled them piece by piece, realizing land consolidation and initially controlling soil erosion. This was the first step. The second step was in 1958, after a winter and spring, the county party committee led the county's ten people's communes and organized a "ten thousand people great battle of Hundred-Li Beach." We comprehensively managed it from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, slope by slope, ditch by ditch. We planted trees and afforested, built dams and reservoirs. The commune members put forward a slogan: "Banks raised, land turned over, four hundred jin per mu must be produced, not achieving the goal we will not give up." In this way, fighting day and night, we turned 120,000 mu of terraces into "water-retaining terraces," achieving "stones in rows, land banks raised, soil conservation and water storage, land turned over." We transformed the chaotic rocky river beaches of the past into 20,000 mu of good land, where crops grew.

In this way, we laid a good foundation for a bumper agricultural harvest through land improvement. During the preparations for planting, in accordance with the requirements of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, the county launched a vigorous large-scale cooperative movement to deeply plow the land. Deep plowing accounted for 70%, which not only conserved moisture but also allowed crops to take deep roots. Each mu of land was fertilized with 160 dan, 60 dan more than in the past. The amount of seeds sown was also increased by 20% to 30% compared to the past, achieving rational close planting, and ensuring full and robust seedlings.

Overcoming the "Hundred-Day Drought"

Let me talk about the drought resistance struggle. Last year, when the autumn seedlings were heading and flowering, we encountered a drought. As soon as this "strangling" drought appeared, the county party committee led the county's communes, relying on the strength and wisdom of the large collective, to launch a hundred-day drought resistance battle. We used the method of watering and fertilizing the seedlings to protect them. Many communes and management districts cooperated with each other in the battle. Shicheng, Danche, and other communes concentrated their labor and waterwheels to draw water from the Zhang River to the high mountains, watering thousands of mu of dry land. The Doukou management district of Shicheng Commune even used the method of suspending pipes with ropes to transport water in the air, diverting water from the south mountain to the north mountain to irrigate the land. The county's 50,000-strong drought resistance army rushed day and night, using all machinery and water sources to rescue the drought-stricken autumn seedlings.

In order to enable the drought-stricken crops to catch up in the later stage, all the autumn fields were shallowly hoeed two to four times, and each mu was fertilized with another ten or so dan, increasing drought resistance. The later the autumn seedlings grew, the greater their stamina. The county party committee thought highly and saw far, and while protecting the seedlings against drought, it proposed measures to prepare for flood irrigation. The county also launched a "million water channels" movement, and irrigation ditches were built in every plot of land. It happened to start raining on August 19th, and men and women, old and young, mobilized together, braving the rain and wading through the river, diverting and blocking the water, irrigating more than 100,000 mu of land, and escaping the threat of drought.

Fellow delegates, although our county achieved the agricultural development program's grain target eight years ahead of schedule, we will never be complacent or relax. In 1960, all production must leap forward even greater and better, and the grain yield per mu must reach 500 jin, all the way to "transforming the Taihang Mountains into Jiangnan." As everyone knows, the only reason why our mountainous area can increase production at such a high speed year after year is that we have the good leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and we have the three magic weapons. Especially with the good system of people's communes, it is like a key, opening the treasure house of mountain production and inspiring everyone's enthusiasm. We must reshape the rivers and mountains and make nature obey our command.

    重新安排河山
    李顺达、申纪兰代表谈山高土薄的平顺县怎样提前八年实现了农业发展纲要粮食指标主席、各位代表：
    听了各位首长的报告，对我们国家跃进的大好光景，更加明确了。我们完全同意这些报告。自1958年，党提出总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝后，我们国家的样样事情，就越办越兴旺了。在这里，我想把我们的家乡——山西省平顺县，提前八年实现农业发展纲要粮食指标的情况向大会汇报一下。
    为争取提前实现农业发展纲要粮食指标，在1956年县委就提出要把“太行变江南、高山薄地变粮仓”的口号。把粮食亩产四百斤，叫“过黄河”；亩产八百斤，叫“跨长江”。一开始，不用说“跨长江”，就是“过黄河”，也有人半信半疑。刚刚过了四年，到1959年，我们全县就比规定的1967年提前八年，实现了农业发展纲要粮食亩产四百斤的指标。我们全县秋、夏田二十多万亩，每亩平均产粮四百零二斤半，比实行农业发展纲要前的1955年，提高60％，比大跃进的1958年，也提高了26.1％。这么大的跃进，是过去没有过的，怎能不叫人人欢喜、个个庆贺呢？
    各位代表，我们为什么能够提前八年达到农业发展纲要的粮食指标呢？下面我对这个问题谈一下。
    大战“百里滩”
    我们先从治山治水、大战“百里滩”说起。大家知道，我们太行山上原来是个山大川少、石厚土薄的地方。平顺有两条干河滩，足足有一百里长。沿河两旁高低不平的山地，是人工造成的梯田。人们常说：“旱涝风雪年年有，庄稼十年九不收”。一听这话，就知道这个地方是个老低产“锅底”。有了互助组、农业社，情况就变了，依靠集体力量，治山治水，和穷山恶水斗争，让粮食增产。可是土地还没有大“翻身”，产量再步步提高还没有保证。为争取这些梯田提前“过黄河”、“跨长江”，前几年，就把它一块一块的里切外垫，实现了地埂化，初步控制了水土流失。这是第一步。第二步是1958年，经过了一个冬春，县委领导全县十个人民公社，组织了“万人百里滩大战”。从山头到山脚，成坡成沟的全面治理。植树、又造林，修谷坊、又修水库。社员们提了个口号：“岸抬头，地翻身，每亩要产四百斤，不达目的不甘心。”就这样白天黑夜的奋战，我们又把十二万亩梯田变成了“水斗梯田”，做到了“石头排队，地岸抬头、保土蓄水、土地翻身”。把过去的乱石河滩，修成了两万亩好地，长起了庄稼。
    这么一来，就从土地改良上，给农业大丰收铺下了好底子。备耕的时候，按农业八字宪法的要求，全县开展了轰轰烈烈的深翻土地大协作运动，深耕地占到70％，既含蓄水份，又能使庄稼扎根深。每亩地施肥一百六十担，比过去多六十担。播种量也比过去增加了二、三成，作到了合理密植，苗全苗旺。
    战胜“百日旱”
    我再说说抗旱斗争。去年正在秋苗绣穗时碰上了旱灾。这种“卡脖子”旱刚一露头，县委就领导全县公社，依靠大集体的力量和智慧，展开了百日抗旱大战。用水掺肥点浇保苗的办法，浇了水，上了肥。许多公社、管理区互相配合作战。石城、耽车等公社，集中劳力、水车，把漳河水引上高山，浇了几千亩旱地。石城公社的豆口管理区还用绳索吊管的办法空中运水，把南山的水调到北山浇地。全县五万抗旱大军，日夜突击，利用一切机具、水源，把受旱的秋苗抢救过来。
    为使受旱庄稼，在后期能够迎头赶上，全部秋田浅锄过二到四次，每亩又多上肥十来担，增加了抗旱能力，秋苗越长后劲越大。县委想得高，看得远，在抗旱保苗的同时，就提出准备洪水浇地的措施。全县又开展了“百万条水渠”运动，块块地地都修了引洪渠、沟。8月19日恰好开始下雨，男女老少一齐动员，冒雨淌河，拨水挡水，浇地十几万亩，脱离了干旱的威胁。
    各位代表，虽然我们县提前八年实现了农业发展纲要粮食指标，但是我们决不自满松劲。1960年，各项生产要更大更好的跃进，每亩粮食产量要达到五百斤，一直把“太行变江南”。大家知道，我们那个山地所以能够高速度的年年增产，原因只有一个：这就是我们有了党中央、毛主席的好领导，有了三大法宝。特别是有了人民公社的好制度，它就像一把钥匙，打开了山区生产的宝库，鼓舞了每个人的干劲。我们要重新安排河山，让大自然听从我们的使唤。
