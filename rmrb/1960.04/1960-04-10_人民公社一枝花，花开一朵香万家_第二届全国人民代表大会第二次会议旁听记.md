    "The People's Commune is a Flower, Blooming with Fragrance for Thousands of Families"
    -- A Record of Attending the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress
  　By Our Reporter
    The call to "vigorously establish urban people's communes" resounds across the motherland like spring thunder. A revolutionary mass movement of great historical significance is gradually unfolding in cities across the country. It will advance with overwhelming momentum and irresistible force.

    The urgent demands and strong desires of the broad masses of workers and urban working people to vigorously establish urban people's communes are centrally reflected in the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress.

    In recent days, delegates from cities have been enthusiastically discussing urban people's communes. Their brilliant speeches are inspiring everyone. The speeches by delegates from the five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan and Guangzhou brought the conference to a joyous climax. Wan Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wan Xiaotang, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Song Yiping, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhu Guang, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in their joint statement: "The development of the urban people's commune movement is an inevitable trend of historical development and an event of great historical significance. It has boundless vitality and a bright and great future. Currently, the broad masses of people in our five major cities are welcoming the people's communes with joy and excitement. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, urban people's communes will be well-managed and will be managed very well. Urban people's communes will undoubtedly display their glorious and splendid beauty more fully in the future socialist construction." This speech sparked thunderous applause throughout the hall.

    For more than a year, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have established a number of urban people's communes, with a population of nearly 20 million, in accordance with the principle of voluntariness. Most cities in Henan, Hebei, and Heilongjiang provinces have basically achieved people's communeization.

    People remember that in December 1958, the Party pointed out that urban people's communes would "become tools for transforming old cities and building new socialist cities, and become unified organizers of production, exchange, distribution, and people's livelihood and welfare." (Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes). This is precisely the case. Many delegates used a large number of facts to illustrate that the urban people's communes established in various places have demonstrated their great role in transforming old cities. A large number of consumers have begun to become producers, and scattered and tedious household labor is gradually being transformed into social labor. Labor glory has become a social fashion, causing tremendous changes in the face of the cities. Some delegates also pointed out that production, exchange, distribution, life, and other aspects have presented situations that the original cities cannot adapt to. In the future, the planning and reconstruction of cities must be changed according to these new situations so that these cities will gradually and fundamentally change into brand-new cities that are completely suitable for socialist construction and the ideal of future communism.

    When organizing urban people's communes and street economic organizations throughout the country, they all start with organizing production, taking the development of production as the most central task. According to preliminary statistics, urban people's communes and street organizations have established more than 56,000 industrial production units, employing nearly two million people. The output value in 1959 reached more than 2 billion yuan, equivalent to more than twice the output value of national local state-owned enterprises in 1949. These industrial production units have played a major role in serving large factories, serving the lives of urban people, serving agricultural production, and meeting market needs. Zhang Xiaomei, a delegate from Beijing, said that street factories have become a new force on Beijing's industrial front. Its production is flexible and diverse, which not only serves the people's lives well, but also increasingly becomes a powerful assistant to large state-owned factories. Some state-owned factories have devolved part of their products (along with some machinery and equipment) to street industrial production units, freeing up their own resources to produce more advanced and sophisticated products. This can not only accelerate the leap forward speed of large industries, but also create conditions for the gradual modernization of street factories.

    The rise of urban people's commune industry and street industry has opened up broad avenues for the complete liberation of the broad masses of housewives. In Beijing, hundreds of thousands of housewives with no capital, no equipment, and no technology have established more than 770 street factories in a short period of time, which has never happened before. In the first quarter of this year, the total output value of street industry in the city reached 170 million yuan, equivalent to the total industrial output value of the city in 1949. From the end of the Qing Dynasty to the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, these reactionary rulers left Beijing with an industrial output value of only 170 million yuan per year; while the housewives of Beijing, under the leadership of the Party, started from scratch and spent only two years to build industries, and the output value in the first three months of this year was equal to the annual output value of the industry that the reactionary rulers had been engaged in for nearly a hundred years.

    Now, no resistance can make women retreat from the ranks of socialist construction and return to the small cooking stoves. Why is their demand for participation in social labor so urgent? Why is their enthusiasm so great? Shi Peilan, the director of the plating workshop of the An Ding Men Electroplating Factory, provided a powerful answer with her experience. She is the wife of a railway worker. Before liberation, the couple worked hard all day long and could not even support one child. But after liberation, they had six children, and their life became very happy. The children went to middle school, elementary school, and kindergarten. Shi Peilan loves socialism and hopes to participate in socialist construction with her own hands. She actively participated in voluntary labor to dig sand and gravel, and a few women pooled money to pull bricks and build factory buildings from scratch. Now, she has improved from illiterate to a higher elementary school education level, from completely ignorant of production to becoming a workshop director, and has become a Communist Party member. She has completely freed herself from her subordinate position in the family and lives a truly happy life. Like Shi Peilan, the broad masses of women are wholeheartedly pursuing the happiness of socialism and communism, and are bravely throwing themselves into various social labor.

    The socialist collectivization of production urgently requires the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life. Therefore, while grasping production, urban people's communes vigorously develop collective welfare and service undertakings, and comprehensively organize people's lives. It relies on the masses, adheres to the principle of voluntariness, and gradually transforms scattered, tedious, and ignorant household labor into a socialist large-scale economy, enabling the broad masses of people to begin to live a new life and feel warm and happy.

    Liu Zihou, Governor of Hebei Province, said that cities in Hebei have established more than 17,000 public canteens, more than 12,000 nurseries, and more than 6,800 various life service stations. The development of these collective welfare and social service undertakings not only enables the broad masses of workers to carry out production better, but also enables more than 400,000 urban housewives to break away from family affairs, participate in social production and social services, and become a vital force in socialist construction. Guangfu Road Street in Tianjin City, in close cooperation with relevant departments, started with the development of production, combined planned supply, rational distribution of goods, and guidance of consumption, and actively organized the lives of the masses. They first helped factories and enterprises to run good employee canteens, so that employees could eat their fill, eat well, and save money, and feel happy. And according to the characteristics of urban residents having different classes, different ethnic groups, and different living standards and living habits, they ran various types of street canteens to meet the different needs of various people. At the same time, the entire street formed a network of social services dotted everywhere, from taking care of children, washing clothes, sewing, hairdressing, beautifying homes to nursing patients, and handling weddings and funerals, etc., achieving everyone having something to do, everything being taken care of, production developing, income increasing, and lives improving. This new type of socialized way of life has greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of workers. Last year, thirty-six factories on Guangfu Road Street all overfulfilled their production tasks ahead of schedule by about one month.

    In the collective labor and collective life of urban people's communes, the broad masses of members have received communist education, and their mental outlook has undergone profound changes. Liu Baotian, Deputy Governor of Liaoning Province, praised urban people's communes as communist schools for the broad masses of members in his speech. He said that the members of the street people's communes in Shenyang are generally concerned about the collective, love the commune more than their families, and the socialist ideology of "one for the country, two for the commune, and three for oneself" and the atmosphere of labor glory and hard work and simplicity have been formed. Due to the improvement of their class consciousness, more than 800 people have gloriously joined the Communist Party, more than 500 people have joined the Communist Youth League, and more than 1,000 people have been rated as labor models and advanced producers at the city and district levels. People who used to be gluttonous, lazy, and did not engage in proper business have now become workers, and some fighting "princes" have become production experts. Members help each other, unite and love each other, and everywhere is a new scene of neighborhood intimacy and family harmony.

    With the birth of urban people's communes, a new situation of "everyone learning culture, the sound of reading everywhere," composing poetry and painting, and practicing singing and dancing has appeared among street residents. The street people's communes in Shenyang have established 429 red and expert schools, 77 middle and primary schools, 52 cultural stations and libraries, and have also organized many amateur theater troupes and singing teams.

    The broad masses of urban people are singing the praises of urban people's communes with joy. Members of the Hongqi People's Commune in Zhengzhou sang: "The people's commune is a flower, blooming with fragrance for thousands of families." This flower of urban people's communes, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, is blooming in the infinitely beautiful spring of the motherland's socialist construction, blooming more and more beautifully.

    “人民公社一枝花，花开一朵香万家”
    ——第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议旁听记
  　本报记者
    “大办城市人民公社”的呼声，像春雷似的响彻祖国的大地。一个具有伟大历史意义的革命群众运动，在全国各地城市逐步展开。它将以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
    广大职工和城市劳动人民大办城市人民公社的迫切要求和强烈愿望，集中地反映在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上。
    这几天，来自城市的代表，都满怀热情地谈论城市人民公社。他们的精彩发言，振奋着每个人的心。北京等五大城市代表的发言，更使大会进入了一个人人欢欣鼓舞的高潮。中共北京市委书记万里、中共上海市委书记曹荻秋、中共天津市委书记万晓塘、中共武汉市委书记宋一平和中共广州市委书记朱光，在他们的联合发言中说：“城市人民公社运动的发展，是历史发展的必然趋势，是一个具有伟大历史意义的事件。它有无限的生命力和光明伟大的前途。目前，我们五大城市的广大人民群众正以欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接人民公社。我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，城市人民公社一定会办好，而且一定会办得很好。城市人民公社无疑地会在今后社会主义建设事业中，更加展示出它的光辉灿烂的美景。”这个发言激起了全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    一年多以来，全国各省、市、自治区，按照自愿的原则，已经建立了一批城市人民公社，公社人口近二千万人。河南、河北、黑龙江等省的多数城市，已经基本上实现了人民公社化。
    人们记得，在1958年12月，党就指出：城市人民公社将“成为改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市的工具，成为生产、交换、分配和人民生活福利的统一组织者。”（中共八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议）事实正是这样。许多代表用大量的事实说明：各地建立的城市人民公社都显示出它对改造旧城市所起的巨大作用。大量的消费者开始变成了生产者，分散、繁琐的家务劳动，正在逐步地变为社会的劳动，劳动光荣已经成为社会风尚，使得城市的面貌发生了翻天复地的大变化。有的代表还指出：生产，交换，分配，生活，等等方面，出现了原来的城市所不能适应的情况；今后城市的规划和改建，必将根据这些新的情况来加以改变，使这些城市逐步地从根本上改变成为完全适合社会主义建设和未来共产主义理想的崭新的城市。
    全国各地在组织城市人民公社和街道经济组织的时候，都是从组织生产入手，把发展生产作为最中心的任务。根据初步的统计，城市人民公社和街道组织已经办起了五万六千多个工业生产单位，有近二百万从业人员。1959年的产值达到了二十亿元以上，相当于1949年全国地方国营企业产值的两倍多。这些工业生产单位在为大工厂服务，为城市人民生活服务，为农业生产服务和满足市场需要等方面，都起了重大作用。北京市代表张晓梅谈到：街道工厂已经成为北京工业战线上的一支新生力量。它的生产灵活、多样，不仅能很好地为人民生活服务，更日益成为国营大工厂的有力助手。有些国营工厂已经把一部分产品（连同一部分机器设备）下放给街道工业生产单位，自己腾出力量生产更高级、精密的产品。这不但可以加快大工业的跃进速度，而且也为街道工厂的逐步走向现代化生产，创造了条件。
    城市人民公社工业和街道工业的崛起，为广大家庭妇女的彻底解放，开拓了广阔的道路。北京市二十几万个一无资金、二无设备、三无技术的家庭妇女，在短短的时间内，办起了七百七十多个街道工厂，这是自古以来所没有的事。今年第一季度全市街道工业的总产值已达一亿七千万元，相当于1949年全市工业的总产值。从清朝末叶到蒋介石反动集团，这些反动统治者总共只给北京留下年产值一亿七千万元的工业；而北京的家庭妇女，在党的领导下白手起家，只花两年时间办起来的工业，今年头三个月的产值，就等于反动统治者搞了近百年的工业的年产值。
    现在，任何阻力也不能使妇女们从建设社会主义的行列中倒退，再回到小锅台旁边去了。为什么她们参加社会劳动的要求这样迫切？干劲这样大？安定门电镀厂车间主任史培兰的经历，作了有力的回答。她是一个铁路工人的妻子，在解放前两口子终日劳累，还养不活一个孩子；而在解放后他们有了六个孩子，生活反而很幸福，孩子们分别上了中学、小学、幼儿园。史培兰热爱社会主义，盼望用自己的双手参加社会主义建设，她积极参加义务劳动挖砂石，和几个妇女凑钱自己拉城砖，白手起家盖厂房。如今，她已经从文盲提高到高小文化程度，从完全不懂生产当了车间主任，成为共产党员，完全摆脱了在家庭中的从属地位，过着真正幸福的生活。广大妇女就是像史培兰这样，一心一意追求着社会主义、共产主义的幸福，勇往直前地投入了各种社会劳动。
    社会主义的生产集体化，迫切地要求家务劳动社会化和生活集体化。因此，城市人民公社在大抓生产的同时，大办集体生活福利事业和服务事业，全面组织人民生活。它依靠群众，坚持自愿的原则，把分散的、繁琐的、令人愚昧的家务劳动，逐步改造成为社会主义的大经济，使广大人民开始过着崭新的生活，感到温暖和幸福。
    河北省省长刘子厚说，河北的城市已办起各种公共食堂一万七千多个，托儿所一万二千多个，各种生活服务站六千八百多个。这些集体福利事业和社会服务事业的发展，不仅使广大职工能更好地进行生产，而且使四十多万城市家庭妇女摆脱掉家庭事务，参加了社会生产和社会服务，成为社会主义建设的一支生力军。天津市光复道街同各有关部门大协作，从发展生产入手，把计划供应、合理分配商品和指导消费相结合，积极地组织群众生活。他们首先帮助各工厂企业办好职工食堂，使职工们吃饱、吃好、吃省，心情舒畅，并且根据城市居民有不同阶层、不同民族和不同的生活水平与生活习惯等特点，办了各种类型的街道食堂，来满足各种人的不同需要。同时，全街形成了一个星罗棋布的社会服务网，从看孩子、洗衣、缝纫、理发、美化家庭到护理病人、办理婚丧事务等等，做到了人人有事做，事事有人管，生产发展，收入增加，生活改善。这种新型的社会化的生活方式，大大激发了职工的劳动热情。去年光复道街三十六个工厂，全部提前一月左右超额完成了生产任务。
    在城市人民公社的集体劳动和集体生活中，广大社员受到了共产主义教育，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。辽宁省副省长刘宝田在发言中，赞扬城市人民公社是广大社员的共产主义学校。他说，沈阳市街道人民公社的社员，普遍关心集体，爱社胜家，“一为国，二为社，三为己”的社会主义思想和劳动光荣、艰苦朴素的风气已经形成。由于他们阶级觉悟的提高，已经有八百多人光荣地参加了共产党，五百多人参加了共青团，有一千多人分别被评为市、区级的劳动模范和先进生产者。过去好吃懒做、不务正业的人，现在变成了劳动者，有的打架“王子”已经变成了生产能手。社员们互相帮助，团结友爱，到处是一片邻里相亲、家庭和睦的新景象。
    随着城市人民公社的诞生，在街道居民中出现了“人人学文化，处处读书声”、吟诗作画、习歌载舞的新局面。沈阳的街道人民公社就办起了四百二十九所红专学校，七十七所中、小学，五十二处文化站、图书馆，还组织了许多业余剧团和歌咏队。
    广大城市人民满怀欢乐的心情，歌颂着城市人民公社。郑州市红旗人民公社的社员歌唱道：“人民公社一枝花，花开一朵香万家。”城市人民公社这枝鲜花，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在祖国社会主义建设无限美好的春天，正在朵朵绽开，越开越妍。
