Chairman, fellow representatives:

I would like to report to the conference on the recent situation of the Jianming Commune.

Currently, the commune members in our commune are engaged in a world-shaking event, which is "to make water flow uphill and let machines replace oxen," carrying out a great technical revolution in agricultural production. Speaking of this matter, we must first thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their excellent leadership, and thank the working-class brothers for their support.

In recent years, our commune's production has developed rapidly. Taking grain alone, last year we harvested more than 17.6 million jin, with an average yield of 650 jin per mu. In addition to food for people and feed for animals, we sold 3.3 million jin to the state, supported fraternal communes with 400,000 jin, and kept 300,000 jin in reserve for the commune. However, everyone felt that there were still two unsatisfactory things. The first was that 70% of the commune's cultivated land, which consisted of slopes and terraced fields, could not be irrigated, and the harvest still depended on the heavens for more than half the time. The second was that the farming tools were backward, labor-intensive, and inefficient. Commune members were busy farming all year round, and there were many treasures in the mountains that they could not spare the manpower to extract. We want to make the harvest of slopes and terraced fields entirely under our control, and we want to find ways to free up people to engage in diversified operations. Since the beginning of December last year, we have started to vigorously develop mountain water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification. After more than one hundred days of work, these things have been done with some success. At present, in our commune, the flatlands have been turned into an irrigation network, mountain ditches have been dug, electric pumping stations have sent spring water up the mountains, and one-third of the terraced fields and slopes have been leveled into garden plots. Up to now, the agricultural machinery we have added to our commune can enable 70% of the land to be cultivated by machines. We also have electricity, which is transmitted from the Tangshan power grid, and electricity is now used for irrigation, processing, and lighting. We are also building sixteen factories, including a machinery repair factory, a fertilizer factory, and an agricultural and sideline product processing factory, nine of which have already been put into production. In this way, the appearance of our mountainous commune has changed dramatically once again. The commune members happily said: "Machines roar during the day, electric lights shine at night, water canals wind around the mountains to irrigate the slopes, and cars and iron oxen work day and night."

I would like to first talk about how we solved the water problem. If the mountain areas cannot overcome the "water" barrier, continuous great leaps forward will be difficult to achieve. Is there water in the mountains? If there is water, how can it be brought up the mountains? This is a difficult problem. Our approach is to have everyone find water and everyone come up with ideas. As a result, we found more than one hundred water sources, truly "as high as the mountains are, so high is the water," "where there are mountains, there is water." We mobilized more than 4,000 strong laborers to participate in the battle to seize water. Based on the ideas put forward by everyone, the strategy for this battle was to concentrate forces, focus on key points, and take down one at a time. We carried out a total of six key projects, including the "three springs combined into one," the Nanshan Grand Canal, the Beishan Grand Canal, and three electric pumping stations. We carried out these projects in the winter. The weather was cold, and the stones were hard, but this did not defeat our team of stone-carvers and mountain-openers who were extracting water. At the Sanlidian Zhaheba construction site, commune members took out their quilts to cover the foundation to reduce the night-time frost layer. After the third company of Xipu Village completed the Baimayu "three springs combined into one" dam, more than twenty people volunteered to watch over it at night, fearing that the new dam would be washed away. One night, a breach actually occurred in the dam. Despite the cold weather and cold water, company commander Qu Wenfen fearlessly took off his cotton coat and jumped into the water to block the water outlet with his cotton coat. According to the original design, the north and south grand canals required the construction of thirteen water-crossing bridges. The commune members proposed adopting the method of building canals around the mountains on the Bishan, reducing the number of water-crossing bridges by six. This alone saved 60,000 yuan. For the water-crossing bridges that had to be built, the commune members also came up with ways to save money and prevent freezing, using mountain grass to weave straw curtains instead of grass bags, saving 6,000 yuan. In this way, through the efforts of all the commune members, thirty-six main and branch canals with a total length of eighty-five li were built on the terraced fields and slopes, and three electric pumping stations were established, turning nearly 40,000 mu of the commune's nearly 50,000 mu of cultivated land into irrigated land.

We solved the water problem ourselves. The machines were supplied by the state. However, the machine cost and various basic construction required an investment of 3.5 million yuan, which had to be solved. At that time, the commune's public accumulation was only 320,000 yuan. The state originally allowed us to pay off the machine cost within five years. I thought that the state's funds were limited, and we should return this money as early as possible so that the state could produce more machines to support fraternal communes in accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation. When I told the commune members about this idea, they all agreed. They said, "The Jianming Commune did not reach out to the state when it had twenty-three poor peasants. Now that we are big and wealthy, we should not increase the burden on the state even more." The commune members enthusiastically took out their surplus money to support agricultural technical transformation. In this way, the commune members' investment, plus the commune's public accumulation, added up to more than 900,000 yuan.

Based on the new situation after preliminary mechanization, we formulated this year's agricultural development plan of 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cotton (seed cotton), and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu; we formulated a large-scale pig-raising plan, reaching 1.5 pigs per mu; as well as plans for developing commune-run industry, vigorously developing agricultural and sideline product processing and comprehensive utilization, and developing diversified operations. If we achieve this plan, our total income can reach 8 million yuan, an increase of more than double compared to 1959. The increased part alone is more than enough to pay off the state's advance payment.

To ensure that agricultural machines can fully play their role in production in 1960, in terms of technical strength, we used the methods of "inviting in, apprenticing," "sending out, becoming disciples," and running technical schools on a large scale. In just two months, we trained more than fifty water conservancy construction technicians and more than one hundred mechanical and electrical technicians. With the specific guidance of the masters, the problem of mastering new technologies was solved.

Water is on the mountain, and we have machines, but the terrain of the mountain area is complex, and the land is fragmented, which cannot fully guarantee timely and rational irrigation, nor can it fully play the role of machines. In response to this situation, we further proposed the slogan of "turning mountain land into garden plots." No one had experience in turning mountain land into garden plots. We adopted the method of combining old farmers, technicians, and leading cadres, researching and experimenting while promoting it. Finally, according to the principle of terraced field dikes and weirs, according to the mountain势, and the terrain, we turned steep slopes into ridges, flattened gentle slopes into squares, squared the inside then leveled it again. While leveling the land, we also straightened out the canals and ditches. The ditches on the slopes and terraced fields used the method of stepped drops to solve the problem of steep slopes, rapid flow, and erosion of the soil layer. To protect the garden plots and prevent water erosion, we planted more than 600,000 trees on both sides of the canals.

We dare to carry out a great agricultural technical revolution in our remote mountainous area because the Party's General Line has pointed out the direction for us to move forward, because we have the experience of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years, because we have the backing of the People's Commune, and because the Party and Chairman Mao have given us strength. This enables us to dare to overcome difficulties when we encounter them; and dare to seize victory when victory is in front of us. We firmly believe that by listening to the Party and advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and victory can be achieved in everything.

Finally, I express my full support for the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. We will definitely exert even greater efforts to strive to complete the tasks proposed in the report.

    水往山上流　机器代替牛
    王国藩代表谈建明人民公社新事主席、各位代表：
    我向大会汇报一下建明公社最近的情况。
    现在我们社的社员们，正在干着一件翻天覆地的大事，就是：“要让水往山上流，让机器代替牛”，在农业生产上进行着技术大革命。提起这件事，我们首先要感谢党和毛主席的好领导，感谢工人老大哥的支援。
    我们社近几年来，生产发展的很快，单就粮食来说，去年就收了一千七百六十多万斤，平均亩产六百五十斤。除了人吃马喂，卖给国家三百三十万斤，支援兄弟社四十万斤，社里还留三十万斤储备粮。可是，大伙觉得还有两件不称心的事，第一件是占全社耕地70％的坡地、梯田还不能浇水，收成好坏还让老天当着多半个家；第二件是种地的工具落后，费工费力不出活。社员们一年到头忙种地，山上有很多财宝腾不出人来去取。我们要让坡地、梯田的收成全由我们当家，要想法腾出人来搞多种经营。从去年12月初，我们就动手大搞山地水利化、机械化和电气化。干了一百多天，这几件事就干的有个眉目了。眼下，在我们社里，川地修成了灌溉网，山上凿好了盘山渠，电力扬水站把泉水送上了山，还把三分之一的梯田、坡地平整成了园田。到现在，我们社添置的农业机械，已经能使全社70％的土地实行机耕。我们也有了电，这些电是唐山电网输送来的，现在灌溉、加工、照明已经用上了电。我们还正在修建机械修配厂、化肥厂、农副产品加工厂等十六个工厂，已经有九个投入生产了。这样以来，我们这个山区社的面貌又一次大变了样。社员们高兴的说：“白天机器隆隆响，夜晚电灯放银光，水渠盘山浇坡地，汽车铁牛日夜忙。”
    我想先说说我们是怎么解决了水的问题。山地要过不了“水”这一关，连续大跃进就不好办。山里有没有水？有了水怎么引上山？这是个难题。我们采取的办法是，人人找水，个个想法。结果找到了一百多处水源，真是“山多高，水多高”，“有山就有水”。我们出动了四千多名壮劳力，参加了夺水大战。根据大家出的主意，这个仗的打法是：集中力量，主攻重点，拿下一个是一个。我们总共搞了“三泉合一”、南山大干渠、北山大干渠和三座电力扬水站等六项重点工程。我们这些工程，都是在冬天干的。天寒地冻石头硬，没有难倒我们这支凿石开山取水的队伍。在三里店闸河坝工地上，社员们为了减轻夜间的冻层，把自己的被子拿出来盖在地基上。西铺村第三连，修完白马峪“三泉合一”的拦水坝以后，怕新坝被水冲坏，有二十多个人自动地在夜里去看守。一天夜里，拦水坝真的被冲开了一个缺口。尽管天寒水冷，连长屈文奋不顾身地脱下棉衣，跳下水去，用自己的棉袄堵住水口。按着原设计，南北两条大干渠，需要修建十三座过水桥。社员们提出采用壁山渠道环山走的办法，减少了六座过水桥。这一项就省下六万元。对于非修不可的过水桥，社员们也想出了节约防冻的办法，山上打草，织成草帘子代替了草袋，节省了六千元的开支。就这样，经过全体社员的努力，在梯田坡地上，修成了长达八十五华里的三十六条干渠和支渠，建立起三处电力扬水机站，使全社近五万亩耕地中有四万亩变成了水浇地。
    水我们自己解决了。机器是国家供应的。可是机器价款和各项基本建设需要三百五十万元的投资，必须设法解决。当时，社里的公共积累只有三十二万元。国家本来允许我们在五年内还清机器价款。我想，国家的资金有限，我们应该尽可能早点归还这笔钱，使国家生产更多的机器，支持兄弟社加快实现农业技术改造。我把这个意见跟社员们一说，大伙都表示同意。他们说：“建明社在二十三个贫农的时候，不向国家伸手。现在，我们家大业大了，更不该给国家增加负担。”社员们热情地把节余的钱拿出来，支持农业技术改造。这样，社员投资加上社的公共积累，一共凑起了九十多万元。
    根据初步机械化以后的新情况，我们制订了今年亩产千斤粮、百斤棉（皮棉）、万斤薯的农业发展计划；制订了大搞养猪计划，达到每亩一头半猪；以及发展社营工业、大搞农副业产品加工和综合利用、发展多种经营的计划。实现了这个计划，我们的总收入可以达到八百万元，比1959年增长一倍多。光增长的部分，还清国家垫款还有余。
    为保证农业机器在1960年的生产中充分发挥作用，在技术力量方面，我们用“请进来，拜师傅”，“派出去，当徒弟”和大办技术学校的办法，只用了两个月的时间，就培养出五十多名水利施工技术员和一百多名机械、电力技术员，加上师傅的具体指导，就解决了掌握新技术的问题。
    水上了山，又有了机器，但是，山地的地形复杂，地块零乱，还不能充分保证适时合理地进行灌溉，也不能充分发挥机器的作用。针对这种情况，我们又进一步提出了“把山地变园田”的口号。在山地搞园田化，大伙都没有经验。我们就采取了老农、技术员和领导干部三结合的办法，一面研究试验，一面推广。最后根据梯田垒坝堰的道理，按着山势、地形，把陡坡打成畦，缓坡平成方，方内再作畦，畦内再找平。随着平整土地，把渠道垅沟也一起整好了。坡地梯田上的垅沟，运用了跌水的办法，解决了陡坡流急冲刷土层的问题。为了保护园田，防止水冲，我们在渠道两旁，栽上了六十多万棵树。
    我们敢于在我们那个深山老峪的地方大搞农业技术革命，是因为党的总路线给我们指出了前进的方向，是因为我们有两年来大跃进的经验，是因为有人民公社这样的靠山，是因为党和毛主席给了我们力量。使我们在遇到困难的时候勇于克服困难；在胜利摆在面前的时候，敢于夺取胜利。我们坚定地相信，听党的话，按着毛主席指示的方向前进，就没克服不了的困难，什么事情都能取得胜利。
    最后，我表示完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，我们一定鼓足更大的干劲，为完成报告中所提出的任务而斗争。
