Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech
Your Excellency Respected Prime Minister Nehru, Dear Indian Friends:
I am very happy to come to the capital of our great neighbor, the Republic of India, once again. I sincerely thank Prime Minister Nehru for the invitation, and sincerely thank all Indian friends for your welcome. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend my cordial greetings to the Indian government and the great Indian people.

Currently, both China and India are engaged in large-scale and long-term economic construction. We both need peace. We both need friends. Peace and friendship are the fundamental interests of the people of our two countries. We jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. There is no reason why all issues between us cannot be resolved reasonably through friendly consultation in accordance with these principles. The Chinese government has consistently advocated talks between the Prime Ministers of the two countries to seek ways to rationally resolve border issues and other issues. This time I have come with the sincere desire to solve the problem, and I sincerely hope that our meeting, through our joint efforts, can produce positive and beneficial results.

The friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples is eternal. For thousands of years in the past, the people of our two countries have been friendly. In the future, for thousands and tens of thousands of years, we will continue to be friendly. History will continue to prove that the great unity of our two countries, with one billion people, cannot be shaken by any force in the world.

Long live China-India friendship!

Prime Minister Nehru's Speech
Your Excellency Prime Minister:
Today, as we welcome you as our distinguished guest, I recall your previous visits to India. Your first visit was nearly six years ago after the Geneva Conference on Indochina. Later, about three years ago, Your Excellency arrived here as a representative of the people of a great country, conveying greetings and good wishes to our people, and we fully reciprocated these greetings and good wishes.

Establishing friendly ties between our two great countries, without interfering in each other's affairs in any way, has been our firm policy in the past, and remains so then and thereafter. This has been confirmed from Bandung and the Five Principles. We feel that this friendship is not only necessary for our two countries, but also for peace in Asia and the world.

Unfortunately, since then, other events have occurred that have put great pressure on this friendly relationship and shocked all our people. Therefore, the relationship between our two countries is currently and will be in the future endangered, and the foundations on which it is based have been shaken. We believe that peace is essential for the world and necessary for the relationship between our two countries. But this peace must be based on sincerity and understanding, and strictly adhere to the principles we once declared. This must be not only external peace, but also inner peace.

Therefore, we are faced with serious problems that make the mood of millions of people uneasy. Restoring and rebuilding this trust and friendly sentiment is a difficult task, but the future depends on it.

I sincerely believe that we will dedicate ourselves to eliminating what has happened in the past, thereby restoring the atmosphere of peace and friendship on which our two countries' relations ultimately depend.

I welcome Your Excellency again and believe that our efforts will contribute to this great task.

    目前，我们中印两国都在进行着大规模的长期的经济建设。我们都需要和平。我们都需要朋友。和平友好是我们两国人民的根本利益。我们共同倡导了关于和平共处的五项原则。我们之间的一切问题没有理由不可以根据这些原则，通过友好协商，求得合理的解决。中国政府一贯主张两国总理会谈，谋求合理解决边界问题和其他问题的途径。这一次我是抱着解决问题的真诚愿望来的，我衷心希望我们的会晤在我们共同努力之下，能够产生积极的和有益的效果。
    中印两国人民的友谊是永恒的。过去几千年来，我们两国人民是友好的。今后千年万年，我们还要友好下去。历史将继续证明，我们两国十亿人民的伟大团结，是世界上任何力量动摇不了的。
    中印友好万岁！
    尼赫鲁总理的讲话总理阁下：
    今天在欢迎您作为我们的尊贵的客人的时候，我回想起您以前对印度的访问。您第一次是在将近六年以前在举行关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议以后来到这里的。后来大约在三年以前，阁下作为一个伟大国家的人民的代表到达这里，转达对我国人民的问候和良好的祝愿，我们充分地回报了这种问候和良好的祝愿。
    在我们两个伟大的国家之间建立友好的联系，而不以任何方式干涉彼此的事务，这在以前是我们的坚定的政策，在当时和在这以后仍然是这样。这一点已经从万隆和五项原则得到证实。我们觉得这种友谊不仅对于我们两国是必要的，而且对于亚洲和世界和平也是必要的。
    不幸，自从那时以来，发生了另外一些事件，使得这种友好联系受到很大的压力，并且使得我们全体人民感到震惊。因此我们两国的关系在目前和将来遭到了危险，这种关系所依据的基础发生了动摇。我们认为，和平对于世界是必不可少的，对于我们两国的相互关系是必要的。但是这种和平必须以诚意和谅解为基础，并且严格遵守我们一度宣布过的那些原则。这必须不仅是外部的和平，而且必须是内心的和平。
    因此我们面临着使得千百万人民的心情感到不安的严重问题。回复和恢复这种信任和友好的感情是一个艰巨的任务，但是未来有赖于此。
    我真诚地相信，我们将致力于消除过去所发生的事情，从而恢复我们两国关系最后所依靠的那种和平和友好的气氛。
    我再次欢迎阁下，并且相信我们的努力将有助于这个伟大的任务。
