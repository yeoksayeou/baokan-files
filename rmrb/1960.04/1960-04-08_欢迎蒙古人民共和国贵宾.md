    Welcoming Distinguished Guests from the Mongolian People's Republic
    The delegation from the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic, headed by Comrade Bayan Monk Jar Khasai Khan, Chairman of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic, is arriving in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country at the invitation of Comrade Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country. We extend a cordial welcome with brotherly feelings.
    Mongolia is our fraternal neighbor. Whether in the revolutionary struggles of the past or the current socialist construction, the people of the two countries have always cared for and supported each other. Thirty-nine years ago, under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party and with the assistance of the victorious Russian proletariat, the working people of Mongolia overthrew the domestic and foreign reactionaries and established a people's regime, laying the foundation for the future happiness of the Mongolian people. At that time, the Chinese people, still in dire straits, were extremely excited and rejoiced at the liberation of the Mongolian people. In the years that followed, the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people further developed. In 1945, the Mongolian people sent their soldiers to cooperate with the Soviet army to annihilate the Japanese imperialist Kwantung Army entrenched in Northeast China, strongly supporting the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and contributing to the restoration of peace in Asia. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of the two countries, who had already taken control of their own destiny, greatly developed mutual cooperation and friendship on a new basis. The people of the two countries have always encouraged and helped each other and moved forward together in the common cause of building socialism. Over the past decade, the Mongolian People's Republic has supplied our country with a large number of high-quality draft horses and other livestock products, supporting our country's economic construction. The Chinese people have also actively supported Mongolia's economic construction. The opening of the Beijing-Ulaanbaatar-Moscow railway in January 1956 provided even more favorable conditions for strengthening ties between the two countries and promoting cooperation in economic construction. Last August and September, the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country paid a friendly visit to Mongolia and was warmly received by the responsible comrades of the Mongolian Party and government and the broad masses of the people. To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, Mongolia held fifteen days of Mongolian-Chinese friendship activities throughout the country. From cities to villages, from the capital Ulaanbaatar to every corner of the grasslands, a deep and sincere friendship was everywhere.
    The Chinese and Mongolian people are advancing side by side in the cause of realizing the common goal of socialism-communism. In recent years, we have been excited to see a series of new achievements made by the Mongolian people in accelerating socialist construction, especially last year, when the Mongolian people completed the great task of agricultural and livestock cooperative transformation. In early 1958, only 35% of the herding households in Mongolia had joined cooperatives. In March of the same year, in order to accelerate agricultural and livestock cooperative transformation, the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided to launch a mass movement for the socialist transformation of agriculture in order to have the majority of individual herding households join cooperatives within three years. The Party's call received a warm response from the entire Party and all herders, and quickly formed a high tide of cooperativization throughout the country. A year later, Mongolia basically achieved agricultural and livestock cooperative transformation. At present, 99.3% of the herding households in the country have joined cooperatives, and the public economy concentrates 73.3% of the country's livestock.
    In 1959, the Mongolian people also realized the task of land reclamation, which is of great significance to the national economy. In this year, Mongolia's agriculture achieved a bumper harvest, and grain production reached more than 130,000 tons. Now, the Mongolian people are working to solve the task of meeting the needs of the people of the whole country with flour produced by themselves in the next few years. The development of Mongolia's agricultural production can also further establish a solid feed base, promote the development of animal husbandry, and create conditions for the settled life of herders.
    Mongolia's industrial construction has also seen rapid development. Before the revolution, Mongolia had no industry at all, and handicrafts as an independent production sector were still in their infancy. After liberation, the people's regime began to build industry. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1957, Mongolia's industrial output value had already accounted for 41% of the total value of industrial, pastoral, and agricultural production. In recent years, with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, the Mongolian people have accelerated industrial construction, and many newly built industrial and mining enterprises have been put into production. Mongolia already has more than 170 state-owned and cooperative industrial and mining enterprises. On all production fronts, the working people of Mongolia are fighting with high morale and full confidence to complete the 1960 production plan—the last year of the Three-Year Plan—ahead of schedule and above quota.
    China and Mongolia are members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and our brotherly friendship is unbreakable. Strengthening the mutual assistance and cooperation and close unity between the people of our two countries will help to further consolidate and develop the unity and cooperation of the entire socialist camp, which is of extremely great significance for defending peace in Asia and the world. This visit to our country by the delegation of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic headed by Chairman Bayan Monk Jar Khasai Khan will surely further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of China and Mongolia and further promote the socialist construction of our two countries.

    欢迎蒙古人民共和国贵宾
    以蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔主席巴扬勒·贾尔卡赛汗同志为首的蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔代表团，应我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会朱德委员长的邀请，前来我国进行友好访问，今天到达北京。我们怀着兄弟般的心情，表示亲切的欢迎。
    蒙古是我国的兄弟邻邦，无论在过去的革命斗争中或当前的社会主义建设中，两国人民始终互相关怀，彼此支援。三十九年以前，蒙古劳动人民在人民革命党的领导下，在胜利了的俄罗斯无产阶级的援助下，推翻了国内外的反动派，建立了人民政权，为蒙古人民未来的幸福奠定了基础。当时，还处于水深火热中的中国人民，以无比兴奋的心情，庆幸蒙古人民获得了解放。在以后的年代中，中蒙两国人民的友谊，有了进一步的发展。1945年，蒙古人民派遣了他们的子弟兵，协同苏军歼灭了盘踞在我国东北地区的日本帝国主义的关东军，有力地支援了我国人民的抗日斗争，并为恢复亚洲和平作出了贡献。在中华人民共和国成立以后，已经掌握了自己命运的两国人民，在新的基础上大大地发展了相互间的合作和友谊。两国人民在建设社会主义的共同事业中，一向互相鼓舞，互相帮助，共同前进。十年来，蒙古人民共和国供应我国大量品种优良的耕马和其它畜产品，支援了我国的经济建设。中国人民也同样地积极支援了蒙古的经济建设。1956年1月北京—乌兰巴托—莫斯科铁路的通车，为加强两国联系、促进经济建设中的合作提供了更为有利的条件。去年8、9月间，我国全国人民代表大会代表团到蒙古进行友好访问，受到蒙古党政负责同志和广大群众的热情款待。为了庆祝我国建国十周年，蒙古全国各地举行了十五天的蒙中友好活动，从城市到乡村，从首都乌兰巴托到草原上的每一个角落，到处洋溢着深厚诚挚的友情。
    在实现社会主义—共产主义共同目标的这一事业中，中蒙人民并肩前进。几年来，我们兴奋地看到蒙古人民在加速社会主义建设方面取得一系列的新成就，特别是去年，蒙古人民完成了农牧业合作化的伟大任务。1958年初，蒙古全国只有35％的牧户加入合作社。同年3月，为了加速农牧业合作化，蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会决定：展开农业社会主义改造的群众运动，以便在三年内使大部分个体牧户加入合作社。党的号召，得到全党和全体牧民的热烈响应，很快在全国范围内形成合作化的高潮。一年之后，蒙古就基本上实现了农牧业合作化。目前，全国99.3％的牧户已经加入合作社，公有经济集中了全国73.3％的牲畜。
    1959年，蒙古人民还实现了对国民经济具有重要意义的开荒任务。这一年，蒙古的农业获得大丰收，粮食生产达到十三万多吨。现在，蒙古人民正在着手解决在最近几年内用自己生产的面粉满足全国人民需要的任务。蒙古农业生产的发展，还可以进一步建立巩固的饲料基地，促进畜牧业的发展，为牧民的定居生活创造条件。
    蒙古的工业建设也有了飞跃的发展。革命前蒙古根本没有工业，作为独立生产部门的手工业，还处在萌芽状态。解放后，人民政权才开始建设工业。到1957年第二个五年计划结束时，蒙古的工业产值已经占工、牧、农业生产总值的41％。最近几年，蒙古人民在苏联和其它兄弟国家的帮助下，加速工业建设，又有不少新建的工矿企业投入生产。蒙古已经拥有国营和合作社营的工矿企业一百七十多个。在各个生产战线上，蒙古的劳动人民正在斗志昂扬、满怀信心地为提前超额完成1960年——三年计划最后一年的生产计划而奋斗。
    中蒙两国是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的成员，我们的兄弟友谊是牢不可破的。加强我们两国人民的互助合作和紧密团结，将有助于进一步巩固和发展整个社会主义阵营的团结合作，对于保卫亚洲和世界的和平事业，具有极为重大的意义。这次以巴扬勒·贾尔卡赛汗主席为首的蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔代表团来我国访问，一定会进一步加强中蒙两国人民的友好合作关系，进一步推动我们两国的社会主义建设事业。
