Comrades and Representatives:

I fully endorse the "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and the "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960" made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council.

Now, I will only make the following speech on the situation of Chengdu vigorously running workers' spare-time education:

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line and propelled by the sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Chengdu's workers' spare-time education work continues to leap forward. In the first three months of this year, a new and magnificent upsurge has been set off. Large factories and small factories, all sectors of society are active across the board, advancing comprehensively. The number of workers' spare-time schools has increased from 520 to 1,125, and the number of enrolled students has increased from more than 160,000 at the end of last year to more than 258,000, accounting for 89% of the total number of workers who should be enrolled. In a short period of three months, not only has a large number of illiterates been eliminated and a large number of spare-time primary and secondary schools been established, but also spare-time universities have been vigorously run. A spare-time education system from spare-time primary education to higher education has rapidly formed throughout the city. Taking spare-time universities as an example, they have developed from 23 (58 classes) at the beginning of the year to 93 (218 classes), and the number of enrolled students has increased from 3,000 to more than 10,300, accounting for 92.2% of the total number of workers who should be enrolled. The teaching staff has expanded rapidly, with the number of full-time teachers increasing to more than 1,000 and the number of part-time teachers increasing to nearly 10,000. The average attendance rate of students in spare-time schools has reached more than 82%, and they persist in their studies and gradually improve. The development of spare-time education has greatly accelerated the work of eliminating illiteracy and popularizing education, accelerated the progress of worker masses becoming knowledgeable, and is cultivating a large number of cadres for socialist construction. The illiteracy among workers who entered factories before 1959 has been basically eliminated. Employees with a junior high school education or above account for about one-quarter of all employees, and employees with a higher primary school education have risen to about 68%. In 1958 and 1959, 70,000 new workers were trained, and more than 1,000 intermediate and higher technical cadres were trained, playing a huge role in the Great Leap Forward in production. Because the worker masses possess cultural and scientific knowledge, they are able to better exert their creative talents and make remarkable achievements in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. For example, Comrade Zhang Deyuan, an old worker at the Chengdu Slaughterhouse, was originally semi-illiterate. For several years, he has persisted in spare-time study, completed junior high school mathematics, high school and junior high school physics and chemistry, and books on internal combustion engines, motors, etc. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the masses, he combined the knowledge he learned with his rich experience and created an automatic skinning machine, and successively realized eleven major technical innovations. Recently, he created an automatic dehairing machine, making a slaughterhouse that completely relied on manual operation realize comprehensive mechanization. When he talked about his experience, he said: "The more I learn, the more energetic I become, and the more I learn, the more my mind opens up." Comrade Song Rui, the Party branch secretary of the Chengdu Biological Products Research Institute, was originally a guard and semi-illiterate. For more than ten years, he has worked hard and persisted in spare-time study. Now he has completed twelve major courses in university and successfully researched and trial-produced Leptospira vaccine, and wrote an academic paper entitled "Leptospira Vaccine". He also learned Russian and translated the documents of the international symposium on leptospirosis held in Poland.

In recent years, workers' spare-time education has achieved great results. By the end of last year, the number of enrolled workers had accounted for 60% of the total number of workers who should be enrolled. Some large industrial and mining enterprises and a small number of medium-sized enterprises have established spare-time education systems. However, in small and medium-sized factories and enterprises, due to the limitations of teachers and the small number of employees in each unit who should enter secondary professional schools and universities, it is not possible to develop spare-time universities and technical secondary schools, nor can urgently needed high and middle-level technical cadres be rapidly trained. In order to more extensively and deeply promote the cultural revolution, meet the enrollment requirements of employees, and accelerate the training of cadres, the municipal party committee held the second five-level cadre meeting at the beginning of this year and the municipal party committee propaganda work conference in February, as well as cadre meetings at all levels successively convened by party committees at all levels. The Party's education policy and the great significance of employee education were further and widely publicized, as well as the relationship between the reason that education promotes production development, the cultural revolution and the technical revolution. This made leaders at all levels and the masses more deeply realize that it is necessary to vigorously run workers' spare-time education, continuously improve the political, cultural, and technical level of employees, and cultivate a large number of technical cadres through self-reliance in order to meet the urgent needs of high-speed production development and create conditions for gradually eliminating the differences between manual and mental labor. On the basis of unifying thinking and understanding, the municipal party committee put forward the measures of combining "points, lines, and surfaces" to vigorously run workers' spare-time education, requiring: large industrial and mining enterprises to independently establish a system; medium and small industrial and mining enterprises to establish a system according to the industrial system; and small industrial and mining enterprises belonging to the district to establish a system with the district as the unit. In order to form a workers' spare-time education network throughout the city, accelerate the process of worker masses becoming knowledgeable, and better serve the sustained leap forward in the national economy. This measure powerfully mobilized the enthusiasm of organizations at all levels, all aspects, and the vast number of employees, forming the broadest mass movement to run education. In a short period of forty days, large industrial and mining enterprises (including some medium-sized enterprises), various industrial systems, and districts have established spare-time education systems, and the employee enrollment rate has increased from 60% to 89%. The Municipal Grain Bureau has 42 subordinate units with a total of more than 1,100 employees, of which only 42 should enter university, scattered in 7 units; 75 should enter high school, scattered in 10 units. In the past, in addition to conducting literacy and running spare-time primary schools, only four larger units in the bureau ran four spare-time junior high school classes, and the employee enrollment rate only reached 50.9%. Based on this situation, many leading cadres also believed that: employee education can only be used to carry out literacy and primary schools, as for running a university, they dare not even think about it. However, after adopting the method of combining "points, lines, and surfaces," it became possible to run universities and secondary professional schools. The bureau uniformly established a spare-time university and a high school, and subordinate units jointly established seven junior high schools. In addition, according to the needs of production, they formed research groups composed of employees with a university degree in subordinate units to conduct scientific research on key production issues. Employees felt that spare-time study had great prospects, not only could they now study in primary and junior high schools, but also in a few years they could study in technical secondary schools and universities, and their learning enthusiasm was greatly increased. All young and middle-aged employees entered spare-time schools at all levels to study. Many employees over the age of 46 also enrolled, and even Wang Yuzhang, a 65-year-old cadre, participated in and persisted in learning, and was rated as an excellent student. He said: "To make revolution, we must study. We must study as long as we do revolutionary work." After becoming a system, the leading cadres of this bureau also became more aware of the great significance of workers' spare-time education and strengthened their leadership. More than 1,400 employees in the catering industry in Dongcheng District are scattered in more than 80 outlets throughout the district. Their business hours are long and very scattered, but under the leadership of the Party, all employees in the industry are organized to study, and have never been interrupted for more than a year. The illiteracy rate, which originally accounted for about 80% of the total number of employees, has now been basically eliminated. After studying, the old workers summarized their cooking experience and wrote seven books with more than 340,000 words, some of which have been published by the Central Light Industry Publishing House. At the same time, in conjunction with teaching needs, they compiled 22 kinds of textbooks. Over the past year, the industry has trained 942 chefs, and ordinary workers can also make 300 kinds of dishes. Facts have proved that adopting the policy of combining "points, lines, and surfaces" to vigorously run workers' spare-time education can completely and thoroughly solve the problem of employee enrollment, greatly accelerate the training of cadres and eliminate illiteracy and popularize education, making workers' spare-time education work have the broadest mass character. This is the specific application and development of the Party's mass line and the policy of walking on two legs in workers' education work.

According to the "points, lines, and surfaces" system, everyone can enroll, and a mass movement of cultural revolution is rapidly launched among the workers. From the city and districts to industrial and mining enterprises, from factories to workshops, work sections, and groups, plans for worker education are formulated at all levels, and many workers have also drawn up personal study plans. In order to make the mass movement of cultural revolution take root and continue to develop, we have focused on leading cadres taking the lead in participating in study and production groups managing spare-time education in worker education. This has not only improved the cadres themselves, but also greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for learning. The Party Committee Secretary of Sichuan People's Printing Factory is a high school class student, and also serves as a political teacher and head of the political teaching and research group; the Deputy Party Committee Secretary and Deputy Director is a junior high school class student and a political teacher; the Director, Chairman of the Trade Union, heads of various departments, branch secretaries of various workshops, directors of workshops, and other cadres all participate in spare-time study. Comrade Wang Litian, Deputy Party Committee Secretary, has never been late or left early for class in the past two years, persists in doing homework, and has excellent academic performance. He was praised by the employees as a "model of learning," which greatly encouraged the employees' enthusiasm for learning. Leading cadres taking the lead in participating in and persisting in learning can better arrange production and education and strengthen the leadership of teaching work. At the same time, it also sets a good example for employees, enhances their confidence and determination to learn, which is of great importance for persisting in running worker education well.

The vast majority of production groups in industrial and mining enterprises in the city have unified the management of production, learning, and life, becoming a powerful pillar for persisting in learning. The electrician group of the Seventh Workshop of the Chengdu Exploration Equipment Repair Factory of the Sichuan Provincial Petroleum Administration, all 14 members of the group participated in spare-time schools at all levels. They live together, eat together, and go to school together in the morning, and there are no cases of being late or absent. In the evening, they supervise each other, do homework collectively, review collectively, and submit homework on time, and there are no cases of delay or failure to submit. There was originally an illiterate in the group, and all members of the group took over his production tasks and allowed him to study full-time for a short period of time, so that he quickly reached the standard of literacy. The group's production tasks were completed very well (it is an advanced group in the factory), and the enthusiasm for learning is very high. The group's management of education mainly focuses on grasping ideology, grasping attendance, grasping mutual learning assistance, grasping homework review and consolidation, and grasping evaluation and competition. Experience has proved that the group's management of education can not only better exert the enthusiasm of the masses for learning and make learning a matter of everyone's concern, but also achieve one pole to the bottom, grasping both production and education, unifying the mass movement of cultural revolution and the mass movement of production, and persisting in year-round learning.

On the basis of group management and education, the city, according to the policy of combining "points, lines, and surfaces," under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, in conjunction with production, implements graded schooling and graded management. Large industrial and mining enterprises generally run universities, technical secondary schools, and various short-term professional training courses. Workshops run junior high schools, primary schools, and short-term professional skills training courses. Municipal factories and enterprises, except for a few large ones, are generally run by various industrial bureaus to run universities and professional cadre training courses; factories run schools at all levels below secondary vocational schools. Small industrial and mining enterprises belonging to the district are run by the district industrial bureau to run universities, technical secondary schools, and various professional training courses; factories run junior high schools and primary schools. In this way, education and production are more closely integrated, not only establishing a spare-time education system from spare-time primary school to university to systematically improve the political, cultural, and technical level of employees to meet the long-term needs of production development; at the same time, in close conjunction with current production, various short-term professional training courses are run at different levels to accelerate the training of technical cadres and skilled workers to meet the current needs of production. In order to quickly train a group of urgently needed technical cadres directly from the workers, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory held a full-time accelerated technical secondary school class in December 1959, drawing on old workers with a technical level above grade four and a cultural level above primary school graduation, and new workers with a junior high school graduation level or above who had undergone one or two years of production training, a total of 47 people enrolled. It is planned to teach and study independently for 1,600 hours within half a year, and after completing 14 courses of similar full-time secondary vocational schools, they will reach a level equivalent to secondary vocational school graduation in major courses and serve as technicians. In February of this year, the mechanical engineering department of the spare-time university (24 people, who have studied for one and a half years) was changed to full-time, and it is planned to complete the original courses within half a year so that they can reach a level equivalent to university graduation in several major subjects and serve as technicians or engineers. The two items total 71 people who are withdrawn from production to study full-time, accounting for about 1% of the total number of employees, which has no major impact on production. And within this year, 71 intermediate and above technical cadres can be trained, which is a very moving figure. At the same time, various professional skills training courses are also run in close conjunction with production in workshops, work sections, and groups, implementing a combination of "points, lines, and surfaces," graded schooling, and graded management. Not only is the goal of vigorously running worker education achieved; at the same time, education is more closely integrated with production, meeting the long-term and current needs of production.

We organize large factories and mines with large factories and mines, industrial departments with industrial departments, and districts with districts to implement zonal evaluation and zonal collaboration according to the "points, lines, and surfaces" in three aspects, and conduct evaluation and inspection on a monthly basis. Competition and evaluation are also organized between workshops and production groups within enterprises. From top to bottom, from zones to points, a competition and evaluation network for worker education is formed. According to the development of worker education, the content of the monthly evaluation has different priorities. Learning from the advanced and helping the backward, so that the whole factory's worker education is consistent and continuously develops. Employees in the city must win red flags in production and also in education, and must do a good job in production and run education well. Achieve a comprehensive leap forward with production as the center, so that worker education continues to develop and consolidate.

In the future, we will continue to strengthen the guidance of worker education, further implement the Party's education policy, and continue to adhere to the policy of combining "points, lines, and surfaces" so that the worker education cause in our city continues to leap forward in an all-round way. At the same time, it will be more closely integrated with the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial production to serve politics and production.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please correct me.

    “点、线、面”相结合　大办职工业余教育
    李宗林代表谈成都市大办职工业余教育的情况各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春和李先念两位副总理代表国务院所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草的案报告”和“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”。
    现在，我仅就成都市大办职工业余教育的情况，作如下发言：
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产持续跃进的推动下，成都市职工业余教育工作继续向前跃进，在今年的头三个月内，又掀起了一个波澜壮阔的新的高潮。大厂小厂、各行各业全线活跃，全面前进，职工业余学校由五百二十所发展到一千一百二十五所，入学人数由去年底的十六万多人达到二十五万八千余人，占应入学职工总数的89％。在短短的三个月中，不仅扫除了大量的文盲，办了大量的业余初等学校和中等学校，而且也大办了业余高等学校。在全市范围内迅速形成了从业余初等教育到高等教育的业余教育体系。以业余大学为例，已由年初的二十三所（五十八班）发展到九十三所（二百一十八班），入学人数由三千人增加到一万零三百余人，占应入学职工总数的92.2％。教师队伍迅速扩大，专职教师增加到千余人，兼职教师增加到近万人。业余学校学员到课率平均达到82％以上，他们学习坚持不断，逐步提高。业余教育的发展，大大加快了扫除文盲和普及教育的工作，加快了工人群众知识化的进度，并正在为社会主义建设事业培养大批干部。1959年以前入厂的工人中的文盲已经基本扫除，具有初中以上文化程度的职工，已占全体职工的四分之一左右，具有高小文化程度的职工已上升到68％左右。1958年和1959年，培训了七万新工人，同时培养了一千余名中等以上技术干部，在生产大跃进中发挥了巨大的作用。由于工人群众具备了文化科学知识，因此就能够更好地发挥他们的创造才能，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，做出显著的成绩。例如成都屠宰场老工人张德元同志，原是一个半文盲，几年来一直坚持业余学习，学完了初中数学，高、初中的物理、化学和内燃机、电动机等书籍。在党的领导和群众的帮助下，他把所学的知识和他的丰富经验结合起来，创造了自动剥皮机，先后实现了十一项重大的技术革新，最近创造了自动刮毛机。使一个完全靠手工操作的屠宰场实现了全面的机械化。他谈到他的体会时说：“越学越有劲，越学脑子越开窍”。成都生物制品研究所党支部书记宋瑞同志，原是警卫员，半文盲，十余年来，他刻苦努力，坚持业余学习，现已学完大学的十二门专业课程，研究试制成功钩端螺旋体菌苗，写出了题为“钩端螺旋体菌苗”的学术论文。他还学会了俄文，翻译在波兰召开的钩端螺旋体病的国际专题讨论会的文献。
    几年来，职工业余教育已取得巨大的成绩。到去年年底止，入学职工已占应入学职工总数的60％。部分大型工矿企业和少数中型企业办成了业余教育体系。但是，在中、小型工厂企业里，由于师资条件的限制，由于每个单位应入中等专业学校和高等学校的职工为数很少，因此还不能发展业余大学和中专，不能迅速培养出迫切需要的高、中级技术干部。为了更广泛深入地推进文化革命，满足职工的入学要求，加速培养干部，在今年年初市委召开的第二次五级干部会议上和2月份召开的市委宣传工作会议上，以及各级党委相继召开的各级干部会议上，都进一步广泛深入地宣传了党的教育方针和职工教育的重大意义，宣传了教育促进生产发展的道理，文化革命和技术革命的关系，使各级领导干部和群众更加深刻地认识到，必须大办职工业余教育，不断地提高职工的政治、文化、技术水平，自力更生培养大批技术干部，才能适应生产高速度发展的急迫需要，并为逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别创造条件。在统一思想认识的基础上，市委提出了“点、线、面”相结合，大办职工业余教育的措施，要求：大型工矿企业单独办成体系；中、小工矿企业按产业系统办成体系；区属小型工矿企业以区为单位办成体系。以便在全市范围内形成职工业余教育网，加速工人群众知识化的进程，更好地为国民经济持续跃进服务。这一措施有力地调动了各级组织、各个方面和广大职工的积极性，形成了最广泛的群众办教育的运动，在短短的四十天内，大型工矿企业（包括部分中型企业）、各产业系统和各区都分别办成了业余教育体系，职工入学率由60％上升到89％。市粮食局所属四十二个单位，共有职工一千一百余人，其中应入大学的仅有四十二人，分散在七个单位；应入高中的七十五人，分散在十个单位。过去，除进行扫盲和办业余小学外，全局只有四个较大的单位办了四个业余初中班，职工入学率只达50.9％。基于这种情况，许多领导干部也就认为：职工教育只能搞搞扫盲和小学，至于办大学连想都不敢想。但是，采取“点、线、面”结合的办法以后，办大学和中等专业学校就有了可能。全局统一举办了业余大学一所，高中一所，所属单位联合举办了初中七所。此外，他们还根据生产的需要，把所属单位具有大学毕业程度的职工组成研究组，针对生产关键问题，进行科学研究。职工感觉到业余学习大有奔头了，不但现在可以读小学、初中，而且几年以后还可以读中专和大学，学习情绪大为高涨。青壮年职工全部进入各级业余学校学习。许多四十六岁以上的职工也入了学，连六十五岁的干部王玉章也参加和坚持了学习，并被评为优秀学员。他说：“要革命就要学习，革命工作做到老就学到老”。办成体系后，这个局的领导干部也更加认识到职工业余教育的重大意义，更加重视职工业余教育，进一步加强了领导。东城区饮食业职工一千四百余人，分散在全区八十多个门市部。他们的营业时间较长，又很分散，但是在党的领导下，全行业职工都组织起来，进行学习，并且一年多来从未中断，原占职工总数80％左右的文盲现已基本扫除。经过学习以后，老工人总结了他们的烹调经验，写出了七本书，三十四万余字，其中部分已由中央轻工业出版社出版。同时结合教学需要，编写了二十二种教材。一年多来，全行业培养了厨师九百四十二人，一般学工也能做三百种菜肴。事实证明：采取“点、线、面”结合的方针，大办职工业余教育，就可以全部彻底地解决职工的入学问题，大大地加速培养干部和扫除文盲普及教育，使职工业余教育工作具有最广泛的群众性。这是党的群众路线和两条腿走路的方针在职工教育工作中的具体运用和发展。
    按“点、线、面”办成体系，人人都可以入学，在职工中就迅速掀起了一个最充分、最广泛的文化革命的群众运动。从市、区到工矿企业，从厂到车间、工段、小组，层层制定了职工教育的规划，许多职工也纷纷拟定个人的学习计划。为了使文化革命的群众运动生根落实，继续发展，我们在职工教育中，大抓领导干部带头参加学习和大抓生产小组管业余教育。这不仅使干部本身得到了提高，而且大大鼓舞了群众的学习积极性。四川人民印刷厂党委书记是高中班学员，同时又担任政治课教师，政治课教研组长；党委副书记、副厂长是初中班学员，又是政治课的教师；厂长、工会主席、各科科长、各车间支部书记、车间主任以及其他干部全部参加了业余学习。党委副书记王立田同志，两年来，上课从未迟到早退，坚持做作业，学习成绩优良，被职工评为“学习的模范”，大大鼓舞了职工的学习积极性。领导干部带头参加并坚持学习，能更好地安排生产和教育，加强对教学工作的领导。同时，也为职工树立了良好的榜样，增强了职工学习的信心和决心，这对坚持办好职工教育，具有重要的作用。
    全市工矿企业绝大部分生产小组已将生产、学习和生活统一管理起来，成为坚持学习的有力支柱。四川省石油管理局成都勘探设备修理厂七车间电工一组，全组十四人，都分别参加了各级业余学校学习。他们集中住宿，早上同吃饭、同上学，从无迟到缺课现象；晚上互相督促，集体作业、集体复习，准时交作业，从无拖延不交的现象。组内原有一个文盲，全组同志就把他的生产任务包下来，让他短时期脱产学习，使他迅速达到了脱盲标准。全组生产任务完成得很好（是全厂先进小组），学习积极性很高。小组管教育主要是抓思想、抓到课、抓学习互助、抓作业复习巩固以及抓评比竞赛。经验证明：小组管教育，不仅能更好的发挥群众学习的积极性，使学习成为大家关心的事情，而且做到了从上到下，一竿子插到底，一手抓生产，一手抓教育，使文化革命的群众运动和生产的群众运动统一起来，坚持常年学习。
    在小组管理教育的基础上，全市按“点、线、面”结合的方针，在党委的统一领导下，结合生产，实行分级办学，分级管理。大型工矿企业，一般是厂办大学、中专和各种短期专业训练班；车间办初中、小学和短期专业工种训练班。市属工厂企业，除少数大型的以外，一般由各产业局办大学和专业干部训练班；厂办中、专以下的各级学校。区属小型工矿企业，则由区产业局举办大学、中专和各种专业训练班；厂办初中和小学。这样，就使教育和生产更紧密地结合，既办成了从业余小学到大学的业余教育体系，以系统地提高职工的政治、文化、技术水平，适应生产发展的长远需要；同时，又紧密结合当前生产，分级举办了各种短期专业训练班，加快培养了技术干部和技术工人，适应了当前生产的需要。为了直接从工人中迅速培养出一批急需的技术干部，成都量具刃具厂于1959年12月，由厂部举办了全日制的速成中专班，抽调了具有小学毕业以上文化程度的四级以上技术水平的老工人和具有初中毕业以上程度的，经过一、二年生产锻炼的新工人，共四十七人入学。计划在半年内，授课和自学一千六百小时。学完同类全日制中等专业学校十四门课程，在主要课程方面，达到相当于中专毕业的水平，担任技术员的工作；今年2月，又将业余大学机械系（二十四人，已学一年半）改为全日制，拟在半年内学完原订各门课程，使他们能在几门主要学科上达到相当于大学毕业水平，以担任技术员或工程师工作。两项合计，共抽出七十一人脱产学习，占职工总数的1％左右，对生产无大影响。而在今年内，即可培养出七十一名中级以上技术干部，这是一个很动人的数字。与此同时，各车间、工段、小组也紧密结合生产，大办各种专业工种训练班，实行“点、线、面”结合，分级办学，分级管理。不但达到大办职工教育的目的；同时，也使教育更紧密地结合了生产，适应生产的长远需要和当前需要。
    我们按“点、线、面”三方面分别组织大型厂矿与大型厂矿之间，产业部门与产业部门之间，区与区之间实行划片评比，划片协作，按月进行评比检查。在企业内部的车间之间，生产小组之间，也组织了竞赛评比。从上到下，从片到点，形成了职工教育的竞赛评比网。根据职工教育的发展情况，每月评比内容有不同的重点。见先进就学，见后进就帮，使全厂职工教育步调一致，持续发展，全市职工在生产上要夺红旗，在教育上也要夺红旗，既要搞好生产又要办好教育。做到以生产为中心，全面跃进，使职工教育不断发展和巩固提高。
    今后，我们将要继续加强对职工教育工作的指导，进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针，继续坚持“点、线、面”结合的方针，使我市职工教育事业继续全面跃进，同时，并使之更紧密地结合工业生产大跃进的需要，为政治、为生产服务。
    以上发言，如有不当，请各位代表指正。
