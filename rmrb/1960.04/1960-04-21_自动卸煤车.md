    Automatic Coal Unloading Car
    In order to increase the turnaround rate of coal transport vehicles, the workers of the Zhuzhou Vehicle Depot of the Changsha Railway Bureau launched a vigorous innovation campaign and produced the first automatic coal unloading car on April 11. According to experiments, it only takes five minutes to unload a carload of coal using this type of vehicle, greatly saving labor.
    This automatic coal unloading car is made using the principle of leverage. They added a round iron bar as a pull rod to the outside of the car body, which is connected to the brake air cylinder installed at the end, and connected the two door hooks with a straight pull plate so that they move simultaneously. The top end of the pull plate is connected to the pull rod. In this way, as long as the air cock is opened, the pull rod pushes the pull plate, and the car door will open automatically. After the coal is unloaded, the car door will automatically close through the movement of another pull rod.

    自动卸煤车
    长沙铁路局株洲车辆段职工为了提高煤运车辆周转率，大闹革新，在4月11日制成了第一辆自动卸煤车。使用这种车辆运煤，根据试验每卸一车煤只要五分钟，大大节省了劳动力。
    这辆自动卸煤车是利用杠杆原理制成的。他们在车身外部加一根圆铁当拉条，同安装在端头的制动风缸相接，并将两个车门钩用一块直拉板连接起来，使它们同时移动，拉板顶端与拉条相接。这样，只要把风塞门一开，拉条推动拉板，车门就会自动打开。煤卸完后，通过另一根拉条的移动，车门就会自动关闭。　（据新华社讯）
