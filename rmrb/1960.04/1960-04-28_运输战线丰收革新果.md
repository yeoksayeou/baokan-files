Eight Provinces and Cities Hold Meetings to Summarize Short-Distance Transportation Innovation Experiences; Guangxi Medium and Small-Sized Ports Undergo Technical Transformation; Qingdao Transportation Department Saves More Than 3,000 Handling Workers; Nanchang Jiangbian Station Dock's Loading and Unloading Efficiency Increases Fivefold

Recently, representatives from transportation and other departments of eight provinces (autonomous regions) and cities—Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shanghai—gathered in Guangxi to systematically exchange their experiences. During the experience exchange meeting, they selected, standardized, and matched the various vehicles, cableways, tracks, loading and unloading machinery, etc., that appeared in various places, to promote them universally.

Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's medium and small-sized ports vigorously carried out technical innovation in loading and unloading, thoroughly changing the backward appearance of port loading and unloading. In the technical innovation, they first concentrated the main raw materials, technology, and equipment to strengthen the technical transformation of medium-sized ports, and then systematically strengthened the technical transformation of small-sized ports in an all-round way. Now, all 81 wharves in the region have basically eliminated shoulder-carrying, and the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of medium and small-sized ports has been greatly improved. As a result, the berthing time of ships has been greatly shortened, and many wharves have basically achieved the requirement of "ships not over the day" (that is, the unloading time of ships arriving at the port does not exceed one day).

Under the leadership of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Qingdao Municipal Transportation Department launched a blitz campaign to achieve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling at high speed. During the campaign, they adopted the practice of overall planning, grasping key points, and concentrating forces to attack in batches, achieving remarkable results. In just over a month, the workers of the three professional transportation units of automobile transportation, port, and railway alone put forward more than 23,000 innovation proposals, and realized more than 9,100; more than 3,800 pieces of various loading, unloading, and handling machinery were manufactured. After these machines were put into production, the efficiency of loading, unloading, and handling was greatly improved. According to preliminary statistics, the city can save 3,100 workers. In addition, 93 factories and 31 warehouses have basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling.

Nanchang Transportation Company, Shipping Company, Nanchang Railway Station, and Ganjiang Shipping Bureau cooperated closely with Nanchang Timber Storage Yard to vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading at the Jiangbian Station Wharf, the central hub of water and land transportation in the city, achieving remarkable results. After only more than 20 days of efforts, five power-driven plow transportation lines were established here, basically realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling, loading, and unloading, increasing work efficiency by more than five times, and saving a large number of workers. Now, more than 500 people at the entire wharf can complete the loading and unloading of 5,000 to 7,000 tons of materials a day, and the labor of workers has also been greatly reduced.

    运输战线丰收革新果
    八省市集会总结短途运输革新经验　广西中、小型港口技术面貌改观  青岛运输部门节省搬运工人三千多　南昌江边站码头装卸效率增五倍
    最近，广东、广西、浙江、福建、江西、安徽、江苏、上海八省（自治区）市交通等部门代表会聚广西，系统地交流了各自的经验。他们在经验交流会议上，对各地出现的车子、索道、轨道、装卸机具等，进行了选型、定型和配套，以便普遍推广。
    广西僮族自治区中小型港口，大闹装卸技术革新，彻底改变了港口装卸落后的面貌。在技术革新中，他们首先集中主要的原料、技术和设备力量，加强对中型港口的技术改造，然后再有步骤地全面加强对小型港口的技术改造。现在，全区八十一个码头，基本上消灭了肩挑背驮，中小型港口的机械化和半机械化水平大大提高，结果大大缩短了船舶停港时间，许多码头基本上做到了“船不过天”（即船到港口卸货时间不超过一天）的要求。
    青岛市交通运输部门，在中共青岛市委领导下，展开了高速实现装卸、搬运机械化、半机械化的突击运动。运动中，他们采取全面规划、抓住重点、集中力量分批突击的做法，取得显著效果。在一个多月中，仅汽车运输、港口、铁路三个专业运输单位的职工，就提出革新建议二万三千多条，实现九千一百多条；制成各种装卸、搬运机械三千八百多件。这些机械投入生产以后，使装卸、搬运效率大大提高，据初步统计，全市可节约三千一百名劳动力。另外，有九十三个工厂和三十一个仓库基本上实现了装卸、搬运机械化、半机械化。
    南昌市运输公司、航运公司、铁路南站、赣江航运局同南昌贮木场通力协作，在全市水陆运输的中心枢纽——江边站码头，大搞装卸搬运机械化、半机械化，取得显著效果。仅仅经过二十多天的努力，就在这里建立了五条动力牵犁运输线，基本上实现了搬运、装卸机械化、半机械化，工作效率提高五倍多，节省大批劳动力。现在，全码头五百多人，一天就可完成五千到七千吨物资的装卸工作，工人的劳动也大大减轻了。
