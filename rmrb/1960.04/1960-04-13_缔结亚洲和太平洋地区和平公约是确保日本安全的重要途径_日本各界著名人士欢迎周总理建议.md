Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: Prominent figures from all circles in Japan, speaking to Japanese reporters, expressed their heartfelt support for the suggestion made again by Premier Zhou Enlai in his speech at the National People's Congress on the 10th concerning safeguarding the peace and security of the Asia and Pacific region.

They believe that the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression peace pact by all countries in Asia and the Pacific region and the establishment of this region as a nuclear-free zone is an important way to ensure the peace of the Asia and Pacific region and the security of Japan. They also said that they will make every effort to realize this peace proposal. Nozaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, said that Premier Zhou's proposal is an embodiment of the principle of peaceful coexistence in Asia and the Pacific.

Nozaka Sanzo emphasized that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal has a huge moral influence on those Liberal Democratic Party Diet members who are now single-mindedly trying to force the new "Security Treaty" through the Diet.

Sata Tadayoshi, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, pointed out: Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal is not an impractical ideal. He said, "This proposal can and should be implemented."

He said that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" makes Japan-China relations even worse. This treaty is contrary to the trend of the world.

Sata stated that the Socialist Party demands that the Kishi Nobusuke government cancel its plan to force the Diet to approve the new "Security Treaty," sign a Japan-China non-aggression treaty based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, and establish a nuclear-free zone in the Far East. At the same time, it requests the removal of the military clauses against Japan in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

Kazami Akira, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, emphasized that Premier Zhou Enlai's repeated peace proposals prove that the Chinese people are friends of the Japanese people in the struggle against the common enemies of the peoples of China and Japan.

Kazami Akira also said that Japanese politicians should remember that as long as the Japanese government does not abandon its policy of hostility towards China, including the policy of creating "two Chinas," Japan-China relations will not improve.

Tanihashi Shigeru, head of the International Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will redouble its efforts to mobilize public opinion to realize Premier Zhou's proposal, support complete disarmament, and make the public widely aware of the peaceful nature of China's policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: Socialist Party leaders held a lecture meeting in Tokyo on the evening of the 11th, attended by two hundred listeners, hoping that the Japanese people would strengthen their unity and resolutely fight to the end to prevent the Diet from approving the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Aoyama Yoshimichi, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly of the Socialist Party, cited the part of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on Japan-China relations at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress in his speech, and pointed out that as long as the Japan-U.S. military alliance exists, it is impossible for Japan to establish friendly relations with China. Yamahana Hideo, Director of the Organization Bureau of the Socialist Party, pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union and China will never launch a war, and if a war breaks out, the reason and responsibility lie entirely with Japan and the United States, who have concluded a military alliance treaty. Suzuki Mosaburo, former Chairman of the Socialist Party, pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is essentially as reactionary as the military alliance treaty of Japan, Germany, and Italy during World War II. He also pointed out that today's era is completely different from that time. The international situation is tending to ease, and the forces of the people of all countries against war are constantly growing.

Katsumada Seiichi, Director of the Education and Publicity Bureau of the Socialist Party, emphasized that only neutrality can guarantee Japan's security. He said that the new "Security Treaty" allows the United States to use Japanese territory, territorial waters, and airspace without restriction. In this case, the claim to demand that the Soviet Union return Habomai and Shikotan islands to Japan is absolutely impossible.

Katsumada condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for implementing the policies of trade and foreign exchange "liberalization," saying that this is sacrificing Japanese agriculture in order for the U.S. government to dump surplus wheat on Japan, and at the same time using the low wages of Japanese workers to provide a long-term and stable investment market for the United States. He pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is to guarantee these rights of the United States for ten years.

Katsumada pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has written a great new page in Japanese history.

    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本各界著名人士对日本记者发表谈话，表示衷心拥护周恩来总理10日在全国人民代表大会上发表讲话时再次提出的有关保障亚洲和太平洋地区的和平和安全的建议。
    他们相信，亚洲和太平洋地区的所有国家缔结互不侵犯的和平公约和把这个地区建立为无原子区是确保亚洲和太平洋地区的和平和日本的安全的重要途径。他们还说，他们将尽一切努力来实现这一和平建议。日本共产党主席野坂参三说，周总理的建议是和平共处原则在亚洲和太平洋地区的体现。
    野坂参三强调说，周恩来总理的建议对于那些现在一心要在国会中强行通过新的“安全条约”的自由民主党国会议员们具有巨大的道义上的影响。
    社会党国际局局长佐多忠隆指出：周恩来总理的建议并不是不实际的理想。他说，“这项建议能够而且应该付诸实施”。
    他说，新日美“安全条约”使日中关系更加恶化。这项条约是同世界趋势背道而驰的。
    佐多表示，社会党要求岸信介政府取消强使国会批准新“安全条约”的计划，根据和平共处的原则，签订日中互不侵犯条约，在远东建立无核武装地带。同时，请求删除中苏友好同盟互助条约中对日本的军事条款。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章强调指出，周恩来总理再次提出的和平建议证明，中国人民在反对中日两国人民的共同敌人的斗争中，是日本人民的朋友。
    风见章还说，日本的政客们应该记住，只要日本政府不放弃它敌视中国的政策，包括制造“两个中国”的政策，日中关系就不会改善。
    日本工会总评议会国际部负责人种桥茂说，日本工会总评议会将加倍努力发动舆论，来实现周总理的建议，支持全面裁军，并使公众广泛地了解中国政策的和平性质。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党领导人11日晚上在东京举行有二百名听众参加的演讲大会，希望日本人民加强团结，为阻止国会批准新日美“安全条约”而坚决斗争到底。
    社会党东京都议会议员青山良道在讲演中援用周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上关于日中关系部分的讲话，并且指出：只要日美军事同盟存在，日本是不可能同中国建立友好关系的。社会党组织局长山花秀雄在讲话中指出，苏联和中国绝不会发动战争，如果万一打起仗来，其原因和责任全都在于缔结军事同盟条约的日本和美国方面。社会党前任委员长铃木茂三郎指出，新“安全条约”在本质上同第二次大战时的日、德、意三国军事同盟条约一样的反动。他还指出，今天的时代和当时完全不同了。国际局势趋向缓和，各国人民反对战争的力量在不断增长。
    社会党教育宣传局长胜间田清一强调指出，只有中立，日本的安全才有保证。他说，新“安全条约”使美国可以无限制地使用日本的领土、领海和领空，在这种情况下想要求苏联把齿舞岛和色丹岛交给日本的主张是绝对行不通的。
    胜间田谴责岸信介政府执行贸易和外汇“自由化”政策说，这是在牺牲日本农业的情况下为美国政府向日本倾销剩余小麦，同时是利用日本工人的低廉工资为美国提供长期安定的投资市场。他指出，新“安全条约”是要把美国的这些权利保证十年。
    胜间田指出，日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争，为日本历史写下了伟大的新的一页。
