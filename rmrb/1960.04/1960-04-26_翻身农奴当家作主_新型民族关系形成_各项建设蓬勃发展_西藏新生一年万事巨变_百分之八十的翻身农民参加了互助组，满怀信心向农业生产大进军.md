Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 25th – Over the past year, as the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee exercised the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet on behalf of the State Council, with the rapid quelling of the Tibetan rebellion and the victorious development of democratic reforms, significant changes have taken place in the political, economic, cultural, educational, and health undertakings throughout Tibet. Everywhere is vibrant and a new era has begun.

Over the past year, thanks to the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's policies and guidelines for democratic reform in Tibet, thanks to the conscientious implementation of the Party's class line, mass line, and various policies in the democratic reform by leaders at all levels and Tibetan and Han cadres, and thanks to the rapid enhancement of the class consciousness of the Tibetan working people, the democratic reform movement, in which a million serfs in Tibet have been thoroughly emancipated and become masters of their own affairs, has achieved a great victory. As of mid-March, out of the 78 counties in the region, 52 counties in agricultural areas, covering approximately 630,000 people, have comprehensively completed democratic reform, and the democratic reform movement in other areas is also unfolding in depth. In areas where democratic reform has been completed, the reactionary regime of the former local government of Tibet has been crushed, and the feudal serf system and its associated Ula corvée system, personal dependency relationships, usury, and exorbitant taxes have been abolished one by one. The broad masses of working people have been freed from the status of serfs and slaves and have been distributed land.

People's governments at the special district, county, district, and township levels have been universally established in areas where democratic reform has been completed, realizing the aspirations of the Tibetan working people to be masters of their own affairs and establishing the dominance of the working people. Currently, the Lhasa Municipal People's Government and the seven administrative offices of Xigaze, Shannan, Gyantse, Qamdo, Nyingchi, Nagqu, and Ngari have been established throughout the region. County-level people's governments have been universally established in all 78 counties in the region, and 60% to 70% of the more than 270 districts and 1,300 townships in the region have also established district and township-level political power. Tibetan cadres hold leading positions in people's governments at all levels. At present, there are more than 300 Tibetan county heads and district heads, and 816 township heads throughout the region. The existing 1,200-plus township-level peasant associations throughout the region are entirely led by emancipated slaves and poor serfs as leading cadres. The vast majority of the staff of people's governments at all levels are from Tibetan working people, who maintain close ties with the masses, care about their hardships, humbly listen to their opinions, and often work with them, becoming close friends of the masses and receiving their heartfelt support and love. The newly grown Tibetan cadres have good backgrounds, high class consciousness, and are progressing rapidly. Some of them have honorably joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League.

The people's democratic united front in the Tibet region has also been increasingly consolidated and expanded over the past year. The Tibet Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the CPPCC committees of various special districts (cities) have been successively established. Patriotic progressive figures from the upper and middle strata, patriotic progressive Living Buddhas and upper and middle-level lamas from various religious sects and monasteries have participated in the CPPCC committees at all levels. The Party and the government have arranged appropriate work and life for them. Thanks to the Party's unity, education, and the adoption of a redemption policy in the democratic reform, these patriotic progressive figures from the upper and middle strata actively support the democratic reform, carry out self-transformation, and are willing to follow the bright road of socialism together with the working people. The Party has continued to implement the policy of freedom of religious belief in Tibet, protecting patriotic and law-abiding monasteries and lamas. After the abolition of all feudal privileges and feudal exploitation systems of monasteries, the People's Government provides appropriate subsidies to monasteries whose monks and nuns cannot afford their living expenses. Through the democratic reform movement, the masses of monks and nuns have participated in the democratic management of monasteries, actively study, demand to participate in labor and various social activities, and arrange their own religious activities. In early February this year, the Lhasa Monlam Festival was held as usual. The lamas of the three major monasteries in Lhasa conducted religious activities such as debating and examination for Gexe (high-level degree in Lamaism) at the Monlam Festival. Bainqen Erdini gave lectures to the lamas who participated in the Monlam Festival.

A new type of national relationship characterized by mutual trust and solidarity is rapidly developing. This is a prominent new change in the political life of the Tibetan people over the past year. During and after the democratic reform, touching scenes of Tibetan and Han cadres and Tibetan farmers and herdsmen eating, living, and working together, confiding in each other, and being as close as fish and water can be seen everywhere. Last year, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet also devoted a large amount of manpower and materials to help the Tibetan people carry out production and construction. The Tibetan people call the People's Liberation Army "Bodhisattva soldiers" and "the dearest friends."

The democratic reform movement has not only politically emancipated the former slaves and serfs, but also brought them economic benefits, greatly improving their lives. As a result of implementing the policies of "whoever cultivates the land harvests the crops," "reducing rent and interest," and abolishing usury, the masses benefited by the equivalent of more than 1 billion catties of grain, averaging 1,500 catties per person. In the autumn of 1959, the Tibetan Plateau had a bumper harvest. For the first time in their lives, emancipated peasants received the vast majority of the fruits of their labor, and generally had enough food for a year. The days when the working people lived on tsampa gruel and wild vegetables are over. After the autumn harvest, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the peasant associations distributed the land, surplus houses, livestock, and farm tools confiscated from the serf owners who participated in the rebellion and redeemed from the serf owners who did not participate in the rebellion to the slaves and poor serfs. In areas where the distribution of land has been completed, each person has been allocated an average of three and a half ke (one ke is approximately one mu) of land. The peasants who received land were overjoyed and launched a patriotic movement for increased agricultural production. The Party and the government have taken many measures to help them develop production. The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region has also distributed more than 50,000 new-style farm tools to emancipated peasants in various places and has established agricultural technology guidance stations in Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, Xigaze, Qamdo, and other major agricultural areas. Emancipated peasants worked hard throughout the winter and spring, and the backward appearance of the Tibetan countryside has greatly changed. More than 80% of the emancipated peasants in various places have formed more than 10,000 agricultural production mutual aid teams, marching towards a great leap in agricultural production. Under the leadership of the peasant associations in various places, a total of more than 10,400 canals and more than 1,500 reservoirs of various sizes have been built throughout the region last winter and this spring, making the area of ​​gravity-fed irrigation land in agricultural areas such as Lhasa, Shannan, and Xigaze reach more than 90%. The fertilizer accumulated throughout the region can fertilize each ke of land by more than 9,000 catties.

During the democratic reform, the Party and the government implemented the policies of "three oppositions and two benefits" (opposing rebellion, opposing the Ula corvée system, opposing personal dependence, and benefiting both herdsmen and herd owners) and "no class division, no struggle, no distribution" in the pastoral areas of Tibet, which effectively promoted the development of animal husbandry production.

In the past, there was not a single school in the Tibetan countryside, and it was difficult to find a literate person. After the working people became masters of their own affairs, they urgently demanded to be emancipated in culture as well. Now, peasant associations in various places have mobilized the masses to raise funds and tools to run more than 1,100 private primary schools and adult literacy night schools. Shannan's rural areas have achieved a situation where every township has a school. The health undertakings of the Tibetan working people have also made great progress over the past year. More than 60 county health centers have been newly established in various parts of Tibet, and people in many remote mountainous areas and pastures can receive timely treatment when they get sick.

    翻身农奴当家作主  新型民族关系形成  各项建设蓬勃发展
    西藏新生一年万事巨变
    百分之八十的翻身农民参加了互助组，满怀信心向农业生产大进军
    据新华社拉萨25日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会奉国务院命令行使西藏地方政府职权一年来，随着西藏叛乱的迅速平息和民主改革的胜利发展，西藏全区的政治、经济和文教卫生事业都发生了重大变化，到处生气勃勃，万象更新。
    过去一年里，由于中国共产党和人民政府对西藏民主改革的方针、政策的正确，由于各级领导人员和藏、汉族干部认真贯彻执行了党的阶级路线、群众路线和民主改革中的各项政策，由于西藏劳动人民的阶级觉悟迅速提高，西藏百万农奴彻底翻身、当家作主的民主改革运动，已经取得了伟大的胜利。截止3月中旬，全区七十八个县，在农业区已经有五十二个县约六十三万人口的地区全面完成了民主改革，其余各地的民主改革运动也正在深入展开。已经完成民主改革的地区，原西藏地方政府的反动政权已被摧垮，封建农奴制度和这个制度中的乌拉差役制度、人身依附关系、高利贷、苛税等也已一一废除，广大劳动人民已经摆脱了农奴和奴隶的地位，分得了土地。
    已经完成民主改革的地区普遍建立了专区、县、区、乡各级人民政权，实现了西藏劳动人民当家作主的愿望，树立了劳动人民的优势。现在，全区已经建立起拉萨市人民政府和日喀则、山南、江孜、昌都、林芝、那曲、阿里七个专员公署。全区七十八个县普遍建立了县级人民政府，全区二百七十多个区和一千三百多个乡中，也有60％到70％建立了区乡级政权。藏族干部在各级人民政府中担任着领导职务。现在，全区已有藏族县长、区长三百多人，乡长八百一十六人。全区现有的一千二百多个乡一级农民协会完全由翻身的奴隶和贫苦农奴担任领导骨干。各级人民政府的工作人员绝大部分都是藏族劳动人民出身，他们密切联系群众，关心群众疾苦，虚心听取群众意见，还经常和群众一起劳动，成了群众的知心朋友，受到群众的衷心拥护和爱戴。新成长起来的藏族干部成分好，阶级觉悟高，进步很快。他们之中有的已光荣地加入了中国共产党和共青团。
    西藏地区的人民民主统一战线一年来也日益巩固和扩大。政协西藏委员会和政协各专区（市）委员会已相继成立，上、中层爱国进步人士，各教派、各寺院爱国进步的活佛和上、中层喇嘛都参加了各级政协委员会，党和政府为他们安排了适当的工作和生活。由于党的团结、教育和在民主改革中采取了赎买政策，这些爱国进步的上、中层人士积极拥护民主改革，进行自我改造，愿意和劳动人民一道，走社会主义的光明大道。党在西藏继续贯彻执行了宗教信仰自由政策，保护爱国守法的寺庙和喇嘛。寺庙的一切封建特权和封建剥削制度被废除后，人民政府对于僧尼生活费用不能自足的寺庙，给予适当补助。经过民主改革运动，僧尼群众参与了寺庙的民主管理，积极学习，要求参加劳动和各项社会活动，并由他们安排自己的宗教活动。今年2月上旬，拉萨照例举行了传召大会。拉萨三大寺的喇嘛们在传召大会上进行了辩经和考格西（喇嘛教中的高级学位）等宗教活动，班禅额尔德尼为参加传召大会的喇嘛们讲了经。
    一种新型的、互相信任和团结合作的民族关系正在迅速发展起来。这是一年来西藏人民政治生活中突出的一项新变化。在民主改革中和民主改革以后，到处都可以看见藏、汉族干部和藏族农牧民同吃、同住、同劳动，互相谈心，水乳交融的感人情景。驻藏人民解放军去年一年还抽出大批人力、物力帮助西藏人民进行生产建设。西藏人民把人民解放军称为“菩萨兵”，是“最亲爱的朋友”。
    民主改革运动使得过去的奴隶和农奴不仅在政治上翻了身，而且在经济上得到了实惠，大大改善了他们的生活。由于实行“谁种谁收”、“减租减息”和废除高利贷等政策的结果，群众得益约合粮食十亿多斤，每人平均一千五百斤。1959年秋季西藏高原大丰收，翻身农民们有生以来第一次得到了自己绝大部分的劳动果实，一般都有了足够一年食用的口粮。劳动人民靠?粑糊糊和野菜活命的日子从此结束了。秋收后，农民协会在党和人民政府的领导下，又把没收参加叛乱农奴主和赎买未参加叛乱农奴主的土地和多余的房屋、耕畜和农具，分配给奴隶和贫苦农奴。在完成了分配土地的地区，每人平均分得了三克（一克约合一亩）半土地。分得土地的农民欢欣鼓舞，大搞农业丰产爱国运动，党和政府采取了许多措施来帮助他们发展生产。西藏自治区筹备委员会还向各地翻身农民发放了五万多件新式农具，并在拉萨、山南、林芝、日喀则、昌都等主要农业区设立了农业技术指导站。翻身农民大干一冬一春，西藏农村的落后面貌已大大改观。各地80％以上的翻身农民组成了上万个农业生产互助组，向农业生产大进军。在各地农民协会的领导下，去冬今春全区共修起了一万零四百多条水渠，和一千五百多个大小水库，使拉萨、山南、日喀则等农业区的自流灌溉地的面积达到90％以上。全区所积肥料可使每克土地上肥九千多斤。
    在民主改革期间，党和政府在西藏牧业区，贯彻执行了“三反两利”（反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对人身依附和牧工、牧主两利）、“不划阶级、不斗不分”的政策，有力地促进了牧业生产的发展。
    过去西藏农村里没有一所学校，农村里很难找到一个识字人，劳动人民当家作主后，迫切要求在文化上也翻身解放，现在，各地农民协会发动群众自筹资金和用具，办起了一千一百多所民办小学和成人文化夜校。山南农村已做到乡乡有学校。西藏劳动人民的卫生事业一年来也获得了很大的进展。西藏各地新设立了六十多个县卫生院，许多偏僻山区和牧场的人民生了病都能得到及时的治疗。（附图片）
