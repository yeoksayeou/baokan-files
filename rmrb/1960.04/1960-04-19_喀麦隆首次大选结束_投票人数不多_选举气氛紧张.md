Xinhua News Agency, Yaoundé, 18th Dispatch: The Cameroonian Minister of Interior announced on the 16th the complete results of the first general election held on April 10th in Cameroon, which declared independence on January 1st this year.

According to the announcement, 69.55% of eligible voters participated in the election. Especially in some cities, many people did not participate in the election. In Douala, the capital of the Wouri Province, the number of people who participated in the election did not exceed 25%. In the entire Wouri Province, only 30.37% of eligible voters participated in the election.

The election was held in a tense atmosphere. The Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, which demanded the withdrawal of French troops, a comprehensive amnesty for political prisoners, and the establishment and respect of democratic rights, boycotted the election. During the election, the police authorities extended the curfew in the entire Wouri Province and dispatched a large number of police officers to patrol the streets and polling areas.

The ruling Cameroonian Union party won nearly half of the votes in the election. However, reports indicate that the Cameroonian Union party may hold at least 69 of the 100 seats in the new parliament. Many ministers lost in the election.

The first meeting of the new Cameroonian parliament will be held on April 28th. The new parliament will elect the president of the republic, who will then appoint the prime minister and organize the new government.

    喀麦隆首次大选结束
    投票人数不多  选举气氛紧张
    新华社18日讯　雅温消息：喀麦隆内政部长16日公布了今年1月1日宣布独立的喀麦隆在4月10日举行的第一次大选的全部结果。
    据公布，参加投票的选民占全体选民的69.55％。特别是在一些城市里，很多人没有参加选举。在伍里省省会杜阿拉参加选举的人没有超过25％。全伍里省参加选举的人只占选民总数的30.37％。
    这次选举是在紧张的气氛中举行的。要求撤出法国军队、全面大赦政治犯、确立和尊重民主权利的喀麦隆人民联盟抵制了这次选举。在选举期间，警察当局延长了整个伍里省的戒严时间，并且派出大批警察在街上和投票地区巡逻。
    执政的喀麦隆联盟党在选举中获得将近一半的选票。但是，有消息说，喀麦隆联盟党可能在新议会一百个席位中至少拥有六十九席。许多部长在选举中落选。
    喀麦隆新议会将在4月28日举行第一次会议。新议会将选出共和国总统，随后将指定总理和组织新政府。
