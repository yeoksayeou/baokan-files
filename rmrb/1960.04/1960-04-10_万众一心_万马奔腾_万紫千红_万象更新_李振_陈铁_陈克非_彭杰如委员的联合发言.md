Chairman, fellow members:

We fully endorse Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report "On the Draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan," and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report "On the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft."

With boundless excitement, we cheer the glorious achievements in socialist construction made under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, through the wise measures of the People's Government and the soaring efforts of the people of the whole country! We pledge to contribute all our strength, along with the people of the whole country, to the sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward of 1960 by strengthening service and transformation!

Before this meeting, while studying at the Socialist Academy, we had the opportunity to visit the actual situation of industrial construction in seven cities of the three northeastern provinces as part of the delegation to the Northeast. This visit gave us a vivid and profound education from the working class as we stood before a new surging situation in the leaping development of socialist industry!

The Overwhelming Tide of Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Arrives

During the period of enemy and puppet rule, the Northeast was originally poor in industry and displayed the characteristics of a colonial economy. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was devastated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, with incomplete equipment, backward technology, and even collapsed factory buildings, becoming ruins. After liberation, the people of the Northeast, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, have built our country's first brand-new industrial base in just a few years. When we visited the Northeast this time, the new situation of the sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the first year of the 1960s was even more displayed before us. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization, automation, and electrification, is developing more and more deeply. The magnificent new upsurge of production is rolling forward, showing that our country's socialist construction is developing at a high speed. Because of this, not only is the total industrial output value increasing day by day, but the quality of products has also been significantly improved, and high-quality, large-scale, precision, advanced, and new products are constantly emerging, some of which have caught up with or surpassed international standards. Also because of this, not only has the economic and cultural outlook of urban and rural areas been greatly changed, but the cities of the Northeast have become completely new socialist cities centered on industry, serving production, and serving the working people. Due to the upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution on the industrial front, the worker comrades, with their fearless spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and their selfless labor enthusiasm, are advancing towards "three-izations." During our visit, no matter which factory, store, or dock we entered, we immediately saw that everyone was making suggestions, everything was being innovated, and sets of automatic production lines, rows of production linkages, and single-machine automation were constantly emerging! This situation truly embodies the prosperous scene of our country, where everyone is of one heart, ten thousand horses are galloping, myriad purples and thousands of reds are blooming, and all things are fresh and new. This situation not only reflects the vigorous and magnificent spiritual outlook of our time under Mao Zedong, but also shows the extremely abundant vitality of the communist style of our new society! It has brought breathtaking feats to our country's socialist construction! Especially when we saw with our own eyes the worker comrades in the socialist labor competition, we could see such heroic slogans in various factories and mines: "The working class has great ambitions, no matter how many difficulties we are not afraid, liberate our hands and feet to make revolution, determined to achieve mechanization"; "If there is no equipment, make it ourselves, if there is no material, find it ourselves, if we don't understand the technology, study it deeply, and don't sleep until we succeed"; "Go for difficulties, give up honors, learn from the advanced, help the backward," and so on. The workers worked day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep, and many innovation pioneers emerged, creating many great miracles, and heroic model figures emerged like a tide, which is really endless to say and write about. What does all this show? We believe that it not only shows the high ideological consciousness and noble moral qualities of the communist style; but also shows the absolute correctness of the Party's strong leadership and the objective inevitable law of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, as well as its infinite power!

Leap Forward Flowers Bloom Everywhere

For example, all the staff and workers of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute, under the illumination and encouragement of the Party's general line, responded to the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee's call to advance towards mechanization, automation, electrification, factoryization, and large-scale radio. Due to the enthusiastic encouragement and strong support of the Party branch of the institute, following the Party's mass line, and with the guidance of the Party branch in the development of technical innovation and technical revolution, and under the leadership of the Party, the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers was adopted, learning, teaching, and researching at the same time, giving play to the communist pioneering spirit, breaking down superstitions, breaking down old conventions, promoting each other, and complementing each other, and finally realizing a great revolution in design work, climbing the technical peak, and achieving "calculation electrification, drawing printing," adapting to the needs of the construction sector at any time. In this way, not only is each process of design work more specialized on the basis of new technology, but also the labor efficiency is increased hundreds of times, and at the same time, a large amount of labor is liberated from complex, trivial, and mechanical mental work, allowing them to go deep into the front line to engage in scientific research and political and cultural studies. The reason why they can do this is undoubtedly the absolute correctness of the Party's leadership, thus showing the commanding role of politics, and at the same time, it shows the infinite power of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, and shows the great power of the mass movement! It has set a brilliant example for us as a tame tool of the Party, listening to the Party's words, and daring to constantly revolutionize and constantly move forward under the Party's teachings! Worthy of our serious study!

For example, the innovation spirit of the "March 8th Restaurant" in Harbin cannot but move us! This women's restaurant was established in August 1958. At the beginning, there were only a few women who had just been liberated from housework. They had neither cooking skills nor management experience, and the equipment was simple, and everything was done manually. However, when we saw it with our own eyes, because they relied closely on the leadership of the Party, and gave play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to do, daring to innovate, and daring to create, they overcame various difficulties, and in just over a year, they had innovated and created as many as sixty-seven kinds of machines and tools, such as universal stoves, food delivery machines, dishwashers, and tools for washing vegetables, cutting vegetables, cutting meat, mixing dough, and making dumplings, basically realizing the mechanization, electrification, and steamification of operations, as well as the automation of sanitary equipment, and achieving "no hands for cutting vegetables, no hands for mixing dough, no walking for delivering vegetables, and pressing the button for ordering vegetables." This "March 8th Restaurant" has been praised by the people of Harbin as the "Leap Forward Flower." Undoubtedly, this is both a flower of the Great Leap Forward and a fruit of the general line!

The reason why these ordinary women can create such extraordinary deeds, just like all the staff and workers of the Shenyang Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute, is that everyone listens to the Party's words under the call and leadership of the Party, breaks down superstitions, liberates their minds, and constantly revolutionizes. It is also because of the Party's education and training that they have developed the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, giving play to a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and drive, and closely linking their work with the needs and interests of the people. Therefore, they are all wholeheartedly loyal to the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, such bright red flowers have appeared in the cluster of myriad purples and thousands of reds!

Through the above specific examples, we clearly realize that: wherever there is the leadership of the Party, there will be flowers and fruits, and the more they bloom, the more gorgeous and radiant they will be! Wherever there are masses, there will be technical innovation and technical revolution, striving for excellence, climbing towards the peak of science, and advanced technologies emerge one after another!

In today's great socialist furnace, such new people and new things have already emerged in the above examples alone. How can such new people and new things not be touching?! And how can they not be heart-stirring?! Recalling that before studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, some of us did not hate capitalism deeply enough, and did not love socialism enough; and some of us were centered on ourselves to varying degrees, and took our personal gains and losses as the standard of love and hate; the requirement of the general line is to go all out, aim high, and strive for the upstream, but some of us did not have enough drive and were content with the middle stream! Thinking of our past backward state, and looking at the soaring drive of the workers now, we are really shuddering!

Today's heroic model deeds, of course, each of them is a beautiful and wonderful picture. Furthermore, from what we gained from visiting the Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall in Harbin, how can the revolutionary deeds, cultural relics, and relics of all the martyrs not be a heroic struggle waged by each of them, under the leadership of the Party and together with the people of the Northeast, against imperialism and reactionaries, undergoing all kinds of hardships, advancing wave upon wave, being steadfast and unyielding, and sacrificing heroically, and written down with their blood in moving historical poems?! These revolutionary historical poems all show the most excellent traditions of the Chinese nation! All of them show the most lofty ideals and the most noble qualities of the Chinese Communists! It is precisely because they sacrificed selflessly and heroically on the battlefield and in the execution ground, and paid such a huge price, that the Chinese people finally defeated imperialism and reactionaries under the leadership of the Party, and won even greater victories from victory today. Their sacrifices not only vividly and profoundly reflected the heroic image of communist fighters who grew up under the Party's cultivation and education, but also created extremely glorious deeds and set up eternal models! Their lives are lives shining with the brilliance of communist thought, and lives dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly! They are truly "born great, die glorious"!

Wear a New Leap Forward Crown and Strive to Create New History

Through the commemoration of the historical sites of the martyrs, and through the visit to the heroic deeds in the socialist furnace today, it has been fully proved that our Party serves the people wholeheartedly, never separates itself from the masses for a moment, and proceeds from the interests of the people. Therefore, Chairman Mao made incisive and profound expositions in his works, from the world outlook, ideology, and methodology to the work methods and work style. In these expositions, he comprehensively and specifically told us how to understand the world, understand society, and specifically analyze objective things, lead work, and handle problems. At the same time, he specifically discussed the cultivation and style that a revolutionary who serves the people wholeheartedly should have. In order to educate all the Chinese people to serve the people wholeheartedly, Chairman Mao also profoundly criticized all kinds of thoughts and styles that violate the interests of the people, and specifically pointed out how a revolutionary should correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the organization, the individual and the collective, and the individual and the country and nation, and so on. These not only set an example for us to serve the people wholeheartedly, but also guide us to better serve the people. All of these, for us who come from the old society, can only be taken as a lifelong goal by seriously studying Chairman Mao's works and strengthening self-transformation.

Today, we are in the great era of Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people have stood up! The light of truth and justice has illuminated the world. China is no longer a geographical term, nor is it as dark as an ancient painting! No matter how shamelessly imperialism and reactionaries clamor in the face of our great socialist construction cause, under the guidance of the brilliant light of the Party's general line, the Chinese people are advancing along the bright road illuminated by the blood of all the martyrs, wearing a new leap forward crown, and racing against time to create new history for the construction of socialism and communism!

Comrades! Let us jointly hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and advance bravely in victory! And wish the conference a success. Wishing the members good health.

    万众一心　万马奔腾
    万紫千红　万象更新
    李振　陈铁  陈克非　彭杰如委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们完全拥护陈叔通副主席的工作报告，李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案”的报告和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案”的报告。
    我们以无比兴奋的心情，为在党和毛主席的正确领导下，在人民政府英明的措施和全国人民冲天干劲的努力下，所取得建设社会主义辉煌的成绩而欢呼！我们保证今后在加强服务与改造中和全国人民一道贡献自己所有的力量，向1960年的持续全面大跃进而奋斗！
    我们在开会以前，由于正在社会主义学院学习，得有机会随本会东北参观团参观了东北三省七个市工业建设的实际情况。通过这次参观，使我们在社会主义工业飞跃发展又进入了一个汹涌澎湃新形势的面前，受到了一次生动深刻的工人阶级的教育！
    排山倒海的技术革新和技术革命高潮到来
    东北在敌伪统治时期，工业原就贫乏，而且显示着殖民地经济的特点。抗战胜利后，又经国民党反动派的摧残，更是设备不全，技术落后，甚至于厂房倒塌，已成废墟。解放后，东北人民和全国人民一道，在党的领导下，在苏联无私的援助下，在短短的几年中已经建设成为我国第一个崭新的工业基地。当我们这次去东北参观时，六十年代的第一个年度的持续全面大跃进的新形势，更展现在我们的面前，以机械化、自动化、电气化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动正在越来越深入地向前发展，规模壮阔的生产新高潮滚滚向前，显示着我们国家的社会主义建设正在高速度地向前发展。正因为这样，不仅工业总产值日益增长，产品的质量都有显著的提高，而且高、大、精、尖、新产品不断地出现，有的已经赶上或者超过了国际水平。也正因为这样，不仅促使了城乡经济、文化面貌大大地改观，而且使东北各城市已经成为了完全以工业为中心，为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的社会主义的新型城市。由于在工业战线上掀起了排山倒海的技术革新和技术革命的高潮，工人同志们以敢想、敢说、敢做的大无畏精神，忘我地劳动热诚，向“三化”进军，使我们在参观中不论走进那一个工厂、商店、和码头等，立即就会看到到处是人人提建议、事事闹革新，一套套生产自动线，一行行生产联动机，一台台单机自动化，不断地涌现出来！这种局面，真是体现了我们国家的繁荣景象是万众一心，万马奔腾，万紫千红，万象更新。这种局面，不仅反映了我们处在毛泽东时代生气蓬勃，伟大壮丽的精神面貌，而且显示了我们新社会共产主义风格极其充沛的生命活力！更为我们国家社会主义建设带来了令人惊心动魄的丰功伟绩！尤其是我们亲眼看到工人同志们在社会主义劳动竞赛中在各厂矿单位都可看到这样豪迈的口号：“工人阶级雄心大，困难再多也不怕，解放手脚闹革命，决心实现机械化”；“没有设备动手造，没有材料自己找，不懂技术深钻研，研究不成不睡觉”；“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”等等。工人们就这样的废寝忘食，昼夜奋战，出现了不少的革新闯将，创造了很多的伟大奇迹，英雄模范人物，有如潮涌一般，真是说不完，写不尽的。所有这些，究竟说明了什么呢？我们认为既说明了共产主义风格所有高度的思想觉悟和崇高的道德品质；更说明了党坚强领导的绝对正确和总路线、大跃进的客观必然规律性以及它无穷的威力！
    跃进的花朵处处开
    例如：沈阳铝镁设计研究院的全体职工们，在党的总路线的照耀和鼓舞下，响应了辽宁省委关于向机械化、自动化、电气化、工厂化进军和大办无线电的号召，由于该院党支部的热情鼓励和大力支持，遵循党的群众路线，在开展技术革新和技术革命中，又得到了党支部的因势利导，并在党的领导下，采取了领导干部、技术人员和工人群众三结合的办法，在边学、边教、边研究中，发扬了共产主义的首创精神，破除了迷信，打破了陈规旧律，互相促进，相辅相成，终于实现了设计工作上的大革命，攀登了技术高峰，做到了“计算电气化，制图印刷化”，随时随刻适应建筑部门的需要。这样，不仅在新的技术基础上使设计工作的各个工序更加专业化，而且又千百倍地提高了劳动效率，同时，更使大量的劳动力从繁复琐细和机械的脑力劳动中解放出来，得以深入现场，从事科学研究工作，并进行政治文化学习。他们之所以能够这样，毫无疑问，是党领导的绝对正确，从而显示了政治的统帅作用，同时，也就显示了总路线和大跃进的无穷威力，显示了群众运动的巨大力量！更为我们树立了作为党的驯服工具，听党的话，在党的教导下敢于不断革命，不断前进的光辉榜样！值得我们认真学习！
    又如：哈尔滨“三八饭店”的革新精神，也不能不使我们有所感动！这家妇女饭店于1958年8月间成立，开始只有刚从家务中解放出来的几位妇女，她们既没有烹饪的技术，也没有经营管理的经验，加之设备简陋，一切都是手工操作。可是，当我们亲眼看到时，由于她们紧紧依靠党的领导，发扬了敢想、敢干，勇于革新，大胆创造的共产主义风格，克服了种种困难，仅仅在一年多的时间内就已经革新和创造了各种机器和工具达六十七种，八十七件之多，如万能灶、送菜机、洗碗机和洗菜、切菜、切肉、合面、包饺子等工具，基本上实现操作机械化、电气化、蒸汽化以及卫生设备自动化，做到了“切菜不用手，合面不用手，送菜不用走，叫菜按电钮”。这个“三八饭店”已被哈尔滨全市人民誉为“跃进之花”。毫无疑问，这既是大跃进的花朵，也就是总路线的果实！
    这些平凡妇女之所以能够创造出这样不平凡的事迹，正如沈阳铝镁设计研究院全体职工同志们一样，大家都是在党的号召和领导下听党的话，破除迷信，解放思想，不断革命。也是同样在党的教育和培养下发扬了全心全意为人民服务的思想，发挥了高度的革命热情和干劲，把自己的岗位工作和人民大众的需要利益紧密地联系起来，所以她们为社会主义建设事业是无不赤胆忠心，因而，在万紫千红的花丛中就出现了如此鲜红的花朵！
    通过以上具体的事例，使我们清楚地认识到：哪里有党的领导，那里就会开花结果，越开越艳，显得异常光辉灿烂！那里有群众，那里就有技术革新和技术革命，精益求精，向着科学高峰攀登，尖端技术层出不穷！
    在今天伟大社会主义洪炉里，仅就上述事例即已呈现出这样的新人新事。这样一些新人新事，怎么不感人肺腑！？又怎么不动人心魄？！回忆在学习八中全会文件以前，我们有的对资本主义痛恨不深，对社会主义热爱不够；亦有不同程度的以个人为中心，把个人的得失利害作爱憎的标准；总路线的要求是鼓足干劲，力争上游，而我们却有的干劲不足，安于中游！想我们自己的过去落后状态，看工人们的现在冲天干劲，真是不寒而栗！
    今天所有的英雄模范事迹，固然，他们每一个人都是一幅美丽精彩的图画，再就我们在哈尔滨市晋谒东北先烈纪念馆所得，所有先烈们革命事迹、文物和遗物的陈列，又何尝不是他们每一个人在党的领导下和东北人民一道向帝国主义和反动派展开英勇斗争，历尽艰苦，前仆后继，坚贞不屈，壮烈牺牲，用他们的热血所写下可歌可泣的历史诗篇呢？！这些革命的历史诗篇，都无一不显示了中华民族最优秀的传统！无一不显示了中国共产党员最崇高的理想和最高贵的品质！正由于他们在战场上、刑场上忘我而英勇地牺牲，付出了如此巨大的代价，中国人民终于在党的领导下击败了帝国主义和反动派，从胜利取得今天更伟大的胜利。他们的牺牲，不仅生动；深刻地反映了在党的培养教育下成长起来共产主义战士英雄的形象，而且创造了极其光荣的事迹，树立了千古不朽的典型！他们的一生是闪耀着共产主义思想光辉的一生，是全心全意为人民服务的一生！他们真是“生的伟大，死的光荣”！
    戴上新的跃进花冠努力创造新的历史
    通过对先烈们的史迹瞻仰，通过今天在社会主义洪炉里的英雄事迹参观，就已完全证明我们党在于全心全意为人民服务，是一刻也不脱离群众，一切从人民大众的利益出发的。所以毛主席在他的著作中，从世界观思想方法、工作方法到工作作风，无一不作了精辟而深刻的论述。在这些论述中，全面而具体地告诉我们，怎样认识世界、认识社会，又怎样具体地分析客观事物，领导工作和处理问题。同时，又具体地论述了一个全心全意为人民服务的革命者，应该具有的修养和作风。为了教育全中国人民全心全意地为人民服务，毛主席又深刻地批判了形形色色违背人民利益的思想和作风，并具体地指出作为一个革命者应该怎样正确地处理个人和组织、个人和集体、个人和国家民族的关系等等。这些不仅为我们树立了全心全意为人民服务的典范，而且也为我们指引出怎样更好地为人民服务的途径。所有这些，对于我们来自旧社会的人来说，只有以认真学习毛主席著作，加强自我改造，作为终生奋斗的目标。
    今天我们正处在毛泽东伟大的时代，中国人民已经站起来了！真理和正义的光芒，已照彻了人间。中国已经不是地理上的名词，也不像一幅古画那么的灰暗！任凭帝国主义和反动派在我们伟大社会主义建设事业面前无耻地叫嚣，中国人民在党的总路线光辉照耀的指引下，正沿着所有先烈们用他们的热血所照亮了的光明大道，带上新的跃进花冠，分秒必争地为建设社会主义、共产主义创造新的历史！
    同志们！请让我们共同高高举起毛泽东思想红旗乘胜奋勇前进吧！并敬祝大会胜利。委员们身体健康。
