I, Wang Xilian, am a member of the Zhaojiawa team of the Huangyu Brigade of the Qilihe People's Commune in Lanzhou. I am already sixty-four years old. For the first fifty years, I walked with my head down, and only in the last ten have I straightened my back. Now, I'm walking with more energy than ever!

Since liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have guided us poor people onto a better path step by step. From mutual aid teams, agricultural cooperatives, to communization, the face of Zhaojiawa has changed dramatically, like the rising sun, higher and higher. In 1958 and 1959, we had consecutive bumper harvests, with average yields reaching over two hundred catties per mu. The barren hilltops have been planted with apricot trees, winter pear trees, and pepper trees. When spring arrives, the whole mountain is green and beautiful. Across the way, on the mountainside, a lime factory, a stone factory, and an agricultural tool repair shop have been built. On the lawn behind the mountain, a breeding farm has been established, raising more than three hundred sheep and two hundred pigs. The brigade has also set up six primary schools, so that our children can all go to school. Since the commune set up canteens and nurseries, my three daughters-in-law have all become good laborers. My little nephew even passed the entrance exam for Lanzhou Normal School last year. I, an old man, have lived to see such a beautiful scene, and I can count myself blessed!

The biggest change in Zhaojiawa is that the Communist Party helped us find water. With water, our farmers have completely turned themselves around.

These days, the cadres are leading us in fighting the drought. Everyone is meeting, offering ideas and suggestions, and discussing ways to overcome the drought demon. If the heavens don't rain and the surface water doesn't flow, we will dig springs and build channels, and develop underground water resources. Secretary Chen and Captain Qi personally climbed mountains and crossed gullies, visited us old farmers door to door, sat down to talk, observed the mountain terrain, and surveyed water sources. In places where there were originally springs, such as Jiuchizi, Pandao Wa, and Hongshangoumen in the gullies, we are digging springs and building channels. The members are all confident in striving for an even greater harvest than last year.

In the past, whenever we encountered drought and water shortages, we also thought about digging springs. But it was really difficult then: first, no one believed in it; second, there was a lack of labor; third, there was a lack of funds. As individual households, everyone looked after their own affairs, and no one dared to take the lead. Now, with the commune carrying out large-scale collaboration, things are being done properly. Recently, after more than twenty days of hard work, we have already dug out twenty springs and renovated and newly built five channels, which can irrigate more than eight hundred mu of land, and we are also building three small reservoirs. On March 20th, four springs were dug out on Shiban Mountain and Lijiawa on the mountainside of Zhaojiawa, and the amount of water was increased by expanding the digging of the original six springs. The group worked hard for a day and two nights and built an eight-li-long mountainside channel – the Xieshan Channel. In the last two days, this channel has irrigated thirteen mu of land. On the evening of the 24th, a landslide suddenly occurred on the hillside, and a stone about a zhang square slid down, cutting off the channel, and the water flowed down the mountain gully with a roar. Upon hearing this news, I immediately called my daughter-in-law out of bed and followed the squad leader to work all night. You dig with a hoe, he digs with a pickaxe, and a large hole was dug under the stone, and the water flowed forward again according to people's wishes.

As the saying goes, those who don't understand the bitterness of the past don't know what sweetness is even when they fall into a sugar bowl. Those who have not experienced it don't know the suffering of the old society. In 1929, there was a great drought in Gansu. At that time, there were only five households in Zhaojiawa. Nineteen people fled or died. Adults were so hungry that they had to dig and eat bitter ferns. One of my sons, just three months old, starved to death because he had no milk to eat; seven animals in the family died, leaving only one ox. My neighbor, Zhao Yuanfa, had a family of nine, and in the end, only he and his old grandmother were left. Speaking of those years, it really wasn't a world for the poor to live in.

This year, in the face of drought, we no longer see anyone looking worried. Because with the Party, we also have water. The Provincial Party Committee has called on the people of the whole province to plant an extra hundred catties of potatoes and a hundred catties of pumpkins per person. One person is not much, but thousands, tens of thousands, the whole province of fourteen million people can produce so much more grain! These days, on a barren slope, I piled up rubble, opened up more than two fen of wasteland, carried some manure, and planted potatoes and pumpkins. This year, with the Party's good leadership, we will certainly achieve "major production increases without rain, and bumper harvests in the face of major droughts."

    有了党就有了水
    兰州七里河人民公社社员　王喜廉
    我是兰州市郊七里河人民公社黄峪大队赵家洼小队的社员，今年已经六十四岁了，前五十年是低着头爬，后十年才直起腰走路。如今是越走越起劲了！
    解放以后，共产党和毛主席把我们穷人一步一步地往好路上引。从互助组、农业社、到公社化，使赵家洼的样子大变，像刚出的日头步步高。1958年和1959年接连大丰收，平均亩产都达到两百斤以上。光秃秃的山头，栽上了杏树、冬果梨树和花椒树。春天一来，满山绿灿灿的，美极了。对面山上建起了石灰厂、石料厂、农具修配厂。山后的草坪上，办起了饲养场，养了三百多只羊，两百来头猪。大队还办了六座小学，让咱们的子女都读上了书。自从公社办起了食堂和托儿所，我的三个儿媳妇都成了好劳动力。小侄子，去年还考上了兰州师范学校。我老汉活到如今，过上这样美的光景，也算享了福啦！
    赵家洼最大的变化，还是共产党帮助咱们找到水。有了水，咱们农民才算彻底翻了身。
    这些天来，干部都在领导咱们抗旱。大家开会，献策献计，商量战胜旱魔的办法。老天不下雨，地面水不流，咱们就掏泉修渠，大搞地下水。陈书记和祁队长，亲自爬山越沟，挨门挨户，找咱们老农座谈，观察山势，勘测水源。在沟内的九池子、潘道洼、红山沟门等几个原来有泉眼的地方，掏泉修渠。社员们个个有信心争取比去年更大的丰收。
    从前，每遇旱灾缺水的年月，咱们也想到掏泉的事。那时候可真不容易：一是没人相信，二是没劳力，三是缺资金，单干户，各家顾各家，没人敢领头干。如今，公社搞个大协作，事情便办妥了。最近，咱们奋战二十多天，已经掏出泉眼二十个，整修和新修渠道五条，可灌地八百多亩，并且正在修建三座小水库。3月20日，在赵家洼山腰里的石板山和李家洼掏出四眼泉，加上对原有六个泉扩大掏掘，增加了水量。大伙突击了一天两夜，修成了一条八里长的傍山渠道——协山渠。这两天，这条渠就浇了十三亩地。24日那天晚上，山坡上忽然塌了方，溜下一块一丈见方的石头来，截断了渠道，水哗哗地淌下了山沟。听到这个消息，我马上把儿媳妇从炕上喊起来，跟上小队长一道去干了一夜。你挖一镢，他刨一镐，在石头下面掏开一个大洞，水又按照人的意愿朝前奔流。
    常言道，不懂得过去苦的人，今天掉在糖缸里也不知道啥叫做甜。没经历过的人，那晓得旧社会的苦楚。1929年，甘肃大旱。当时赵家洼只有五户人家，逃的、死的，就有十九口人。成年人饿得没法子，就挖苦蕨吃。我的一个小子，刚生下三个月，没奶吃活活饿死了；家里七头牲口，结果死得剩一头牛。我的邻居赵元发，一家九口人，最后只留下他和老奶奶。提起那年头，真不是穷人活的世界。
    今年，在干旱面前，再也看不到有人愁眉苦脸。因为有了党，也有了水。省委号召全省人民每人多种百斤洋芋、百斤南瓜。一人不算多，千人、万人，全省一千四百万人就能多打多少粮食！这几天，我在一个荒坡上，垒起乱石，开了二分多荒地，背上一些粪，就把洋芋、南瓜种上了。今年，有党的好领导，一定会“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”。
