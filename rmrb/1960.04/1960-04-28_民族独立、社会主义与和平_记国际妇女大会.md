    National Independence, Socialism, and Peace
    ——A Record of the International Women's Congress
    Qian Xing

    To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of International Working Women's Day, the International Women's Congress, held in Copenhagen from the 21st to the 24th, was filled with deep feelings for women in socialist countries, sympathy and support for the desire of women oppressed by colonialists to achieve national independence, and a strong desire for peace. The approximately one thousand women attending the conference, from more than seventy countries, also held a torchlight procession in the square where the first International Women's Congress was held fifty years ago. The decision to commemorate peace and women's rights every year on March 8 was made at that conference fifty years ago.

    The wide range of representation at this conference could be seen in many ways: the diverse styles of national costumes, the large number of translators serving as bridges for various languages, the different situations of women's lives reflected in the representatives' speeches, and the diverse opinions expressed. However, these differences seemed unimportant when they reached a common and most important conclusion after heated discussions. Their conclusion was that in order for all children to have a secure future, and for women and men to live a dignified life, there must be peace, and hunger and ignorance must be eliminated.

    The speeches of the representatives of socialist countries were warmly welcomed by the representatives attending the meeting, which showed the envy of women from many countries for their sisters who had already achieved the goals they desired or pursued. Under the people's government, thanks to the help of the government, the support of men, and the conscious efforts of women, they have gained full opportunities for truly equal development.

    The Soviet delegation received great attention at the meeting. The delegation included representatives of the Supreme Soviet; the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek Republic, who was a serf forty years ago; the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Armenia; collective farm scientists; doctors, journalists, teachers, and industrial workers. They concretely demonstrated the path of women's liberation in the Soviet Union and their current status in Soviet society. The head of the delegation, Nina Popova, a representative of the Supreme Soviet, said at the conference that the total number of Soviet women currently engaged in physical and mental labor has reached 26 million, accounting for about half of the total employment. In the Soviet Union, half of the managers and experts are women.

    Chinese women were warmly welcomed both in the conference hall and in the group meetings. The Chinese delegation, headed by Minister of Health Li Dequan, made a speech at the conference. The Chinese representatives vividly introduced the active lives of Chinese women in various fields to the audience. More and more women are taking on important positions in governments at all levels. Women workers, technicians, engineers, and experts have played an extremely important role in the nationwide technical revolution movement, which is bringing the great leap forward of China's economic construction to a new height. Kindergartens, nurseries, public canteens, and other social service centers in rural and urban people's communes have opened the way for the thorough liberation of women. The universal new style of "one for all, all for one," and the people's, especially women's, enthusiastic support for this new way of life, refute the slanders of malicious people and dispel the doubts of some well-meaning people.

    Along with economic development comes a high tide of cultural revolution. A large number of new generation women artists are emerging in theater, music, dance, and other areas of art and culture. Zhao Qing, a young dancer who participated in this conference, is an outstanding example. At an impromptu music and dance evening performance before the closing of the conference, her performance of Chinese classical dance won thunderous applause. She was often surrounded by the audience after her performance. Tsering Yuzhen, a Tibetan girl and folk singer who used to be a shepherdess and is now a student at a national college, also received enthusiastic praise for her singing at the conference.

    Chinese women representatives were often surrounded by representatives from many countries at and after the meetings. They were eager to know more about China. One Chinese representative pointed out in a conversation with women representatives from various countries that, based on their own experience, Chinese women realized that expelling foreign imperialist invaders, achieving national independence, establishing a people's government, realizing a great leap forward in economic construction, participating in the production work of the communes, and establishing social welfare and service undertakings are all key to realizing women's rights and creating truly happy families. When the representatives watched the film "Always Spring in Full Bloom," which truly reflected how Chinese housewives, after some conflicts and struggles, finally stepped out of their homes, participated in production and social work, participated in national construction, and laid the new foundation for family happiness, they felt more truly about the happy lives of Chinese women.

    Representatives from eleven African countries spoke at the meeting about the oppression of women and men in African colonial countries. The experience narrated by a representative from the Ivory Coast brought tears to the audience. Her husband, like many others, was expelled from the Ivory Coast for engaging in the cause of national independence for the Ivory Coast. Unable to support her four children, she entrusted two of them to a friend, who was also unable to adopt them. The two children lived outdoors, wandering around, unable to find any work. She said that our problem is not a question of maternal love, we have plenty of maternal love, our problem is national independence, which is the most important thing, and only with national independence can we ensure that our maternal love is not hindered.

    A woman from Cameroon said that Cameroon, which has been under French colonial rule for three hundred years, now has many people who cannot even write their own names. At international conferences, Cameroon is represented by French people. She said that the Cameroonian people have reached the end of their patience. The French must get out. The representative firmly said: "We do not want them to go out the door and climb in through the window. We demand complete independence. Without complete independence, there is no peace. When we are not our own masters, it is useless to talk about economic, social, and cultural rights."

    An Algerian representative said at the conference that French colonialists had massacred one million Algerians, imprisoned 500,000 Algerians in concentration camps, and driven two million civilians out of their homeland into concentration areas. A French lawyer strongly supported the accusations of the Algerian representative. She testified that it was a shame that a "civilized" country like France committed such barbaric and criminal acts.

    A representative from Sierra Leone said at the conference that the people of Sierra Leone lived in poverty, disease, and ignorance, and under British colonial rule, they were deprived of basic human rights. She said that Sierra Leone demands complete independence, and without complete independence, the long, dark, and tragic night will not end.

    Representatives from about twenty countries in Central and South America attended the conference. A woman from Venezuela said that women in Venezuela, like women in many Latin American countries, are suffering from the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism. A representative from Argentina said that her country is rich, but the people are very poor. Who is to blame for the suffering of women and people in Latin American countries? The awakened people can see clearly, and that is U.S. imperialism.

    The people of Latin America are waging an unyielding struggle against this imperialist. A representative from Uruguay spoke at the conference about the struggle of Uruguayan women against U.S. military bases that endanger Latin America. She said that Uruguayan women want to learn from the heroic struggle of Cuban sisters against U.S. provocateurs.

    The Japanese women's representative called on women around the world to support the struggle of Japanese women against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." She expressed strong opposition to the U.S. aggressive policy. She said: "The greatest danger facing the Japanese people is the new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' which aims to strengthen the U.S.-Japan military alliance and directly oppose the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. The U.S.-Japan military alliance, strengthened through the new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' is a threat to peace and democracy in Asia." She said that the vast majority of the Japanese people oppose this treaty, which enhances Japan's subordinate status to the United States and turns Japan into a partner in aggressive policies.

    The resolutions of the conference represent the voices of millions of women. The resolution said: They demand a halt to everything that endangers peace: occupying forces, military bases on foreign territories, existing or planned military treaties.

    At the closing ceremony, Elizabeth Flynn, a representative from the United States, said that the socialist revolution of the twentieth century advocates the complete liberation of women, which has been realized in the Soviet Union. After returning to the United States, we will work for a new America. This new America is what millions of American men and women workers should have, who strongly oppose war instigators and exploiters, and they are the true hope of America.

    The four-day International Women's Congress presented a clear picture: the "yesterday" of women in socialist countries is still the "today" of women in many other countries. But there is no doubt that the "today" of those who stand at the forefront will become the "tomorrow" of some unfortunate sisters. The day when we join hands and move forward for a brighter "tomorrow" will surely come.

    民族独立、社会主义与和平
    ——记国际妇女大会
    钱行
    为了纪念国际劳动妇女节五十周年，从21日至24日在哥本哈根举行的国际妇女大会，洋溢着对社会主义国家妇女的深厚情谊、对受殖民者压迫的妇女要求民族独立愿望的同情与支持、对和平的强烈愿望。参加会议的来自七十多个国家的一千名左右的妇女，还在五十年前第一次举行国际妇女大会的广场上举行了火炬游行。每年3月8日纪念和平和妇女权利的决定，就是在五十年前的那次会议上作出的。
    这次大会代表的广泛性可以从花色样式繁多的各种民族服装、作为各种不同的语言的桥梁的翻译工作者数目庞大、代表们讲演中所反映的各种不同的妇女生活情况，以及提出的各自不同的见解等等许多方面看得出来。但是当她们经过热烈的讨论，得出了共同的、最主要的结论时，这些不同就显得很不重要了。她们的结论是：为了使所有的儿童都有安全的未来，为了使妇女与男子都能过着有尊严的人的生活，必须有和平，必须消灭饥饿和愚昧。
    社会主义国家代表的演说，受到了出席会议代表们的热烈的欢迎，这种热烈的欢迎表示着许多国家的妇女对已经实现了她们所渴望或追求的目标的姊妹们的羡慕。在人民政权下，由于政府的帮助、男子的支持以及妇女们自觉的努力，她们已经取得真正平等发展的充分机会。
  苏联代表团在会上受到很大的注意。这个代表团中有最高苏维埃的代表；有四十年前还是一个农奴的乌兹别克共和国部长会议主席；有亚美尼亚部长会议主席；有集体农庄的科学家；有医生、新闻工作者、教师、产业工人。她们具体地表现了苏联妇女解放所经历的道路和她们今天在苏联社会中的地位。代表团团长尼娜·波波娃是最高苏维埃代表，她在大会上说，目前参加体力和脑力劳动的苏联妇女总数已达二千六百万人，约为就业总人数的一半。在苏联，管理人员和专家的半数是妇女。
    中国妇女无论在大会会场上和小组会中都受到了热烈的欢迎。以卫生部长李德全为首的中国代表团在大会上作了发言。中国代表向听众生动地介绍了中国妇女在各个方面的活跃生活。愈来愈多的妇女正在担任各级政府的重要工作。妇女工人、技术员、工程师、专家在全国范围的技术革命运动中起了极其重大的作用，这个运动正在把中国的经济建设的大跃进带到新的高度。农村人民公社、城市人民公社的幼儿园、托儿所、公共食堂以及其他的社会服务中心，打开了妇女彻底解放的道路。“我为人人、人人为我”的普遍新风格，人民尤其是妇女对这种新的生活方式的热烈支持，驳斥了怀有恶意的人的诽谤，解除了一些好心人的怀疑。
    随着经济发展而来的是文化革命的高潮。在戏剧、音乐、舞蹈和艺术文化其他部门中，新的一代的妇女艺术家大批地涌现出来。参加这次大会的青年舞蹈家赵青就是一个杰出的例证。在大会闭幕前的一次即席演出的音乐舞蹈晚会上，她所表演的中国古典舞蹈赢得了雷鸣似的掌声。她在表演以后经常受到观众的包围。西藏族的少女、民歌演唱者次仁玉珍从前是牧羊女，现在是民族学院的学员，她在大会上的演唱也受到了热烈的赞赏。
    中国妇女代表经常在会上和会下受到许多国家代表的包围。她们渴望知道更多的关于中国的事情。有一位中国代表在和各国妇女代表交谈中曾经指出：中国妇女根据自己的经验，认识到驱逐外国帝国主义侵略者、实现民族独立、建立人民政权、实现经济建设的跃进、参加公社的生产工作、建立社会福利及服务事业，这一切都是实现妇女的权利、造成真正的快乐的家庭的关键所在。当代表们观看了真实地反映出了中国家庭妇女如何经过一些冲突与斗争，终于走出家庭、参加生产和社会工作，参加了国家的建设、奠立了家庭快乐的新基础这些情况的影片“万紫千红总是春”以后，他们对中国妇女的幸福生活感到更为真切了。
    来自非洲十一个国家的代表，在会上述说了非洲殖民地国家中妇女和男子受压迫的情况。象牙海岸的一位代表讲述的经历，使听众流下了眼泪。她的丈夫，像许多别的人一样，由于从事了争取象牙海岸民族独立的事业，被驱逐出象牙海岸。她无法养活四个孩子，就把两个孩子寄托给朋友，她的朋友也无力收养他们。两个孩子就露宿在户外，他们到处流浪，找不到任何工作。她说，我们的问题不是什么母爱的问题，我们有的是母爱，我们的问题是民族独立问题，这是首要的，有了民族独立才能保证我们的母爱不会受阻碍。
    喀麦隆的一位妇女说，受法国殖民统治达三百年之久的喀麦隆，现在有许多人连自己的姓名也不会写。在国际性的会议上，喀麦隆是由法国人来代表的。她说，喀麦隆人已经忍无可忍了。法国人必须滚出去。这位代表坚决地说：“我们不希望他们从大门出去，又从窗子里爬进来。我们要求完全的独立。没有完全的独立，就没有和平。当我们还不是自己的主人时，谈论经济、社会、文化权利都是无益的。”
    一位阿尔及利亚的代表在大会上说，法国殖民者屠杀了一百万名阿尔及利亚人，并且把五十万阿尔及利亚人关入了集中营，还把两百万平民逐出他们的故乡，驱进集中区。一位法国律师有力地支持了这位阿尔及利亚代表的控诉。她作证说，像法国这样的“文明”国家，作出了这种野蛮、犯罪的行为，真是耻辱。
    塞拉勒窝内的一位代表在大会上说，塞拉勒窝内人民生活在贫困、疾病、无知之中，在英国殖民统治之下，他们被剥夺了基本的人权。她说，塞拉勒窝内要求完全独立，没有完全的独立，漫长、黑暗、悲惨的黑夜就不会结束。
    中、南美洲大约二十个国家的代表出席了大会，委内瑞拉的一位妇女说，委内瑞拉的妇女正像拉丁美洲许多国家的妇女一样，受着帝国主义和封建主义的双重压迫。阿根廷的一位代表说，她的国家是富足的，但是人民却很贫困。拉丁美洲国家妇女和人民身受的这种苦难究竟是谁造成的呢？觉醒了的人民是能看得清的，这就是美国帝国主义。
    拉丁美洲人民正在和这个帝国主义者作不屈的斗争。乌拉圭的一位代表在大会上讲述了乌拉圭妇女反对危害拉丁美洲的美国军事基地的斗争。她说，乌拉圭妇女要学习古巴姊妹反抗美国挑衅者的英勇战斗。
    日本的妇女代表呼吁全世界妇女支持日本妇女的反对日美新“安全条约”的斗争。她表达了对美国侵略政策的强烈反对情绪。她说：“日本人民面临的最大的危险，就是日美新‘安全条约’，这个条约的目的是加强日美军事同盟，直接反对苏联、中国和其他的社会主义国家。通过日美新‘安全条约’而加强的日美军事同盟，是对亚洲的和平与民主的威胁。”她说，绝大多数的日本人民，都反对这个增强日本对美国的附属地位、把日本变成侵略政策伙伴的条约。
    大会的决议代表着千百万妇女的呼声。决议说：她们要求制止危及和平的一切：占领军、在外国领土上的军事基地、现有的或正在准备的军事条约。
    在闭幕仪式上，美国的一名代表伊丽莎白·弗林说，二十世纪的社会主义革命，主张妇女彻底解放，这在苏联已经实现了，回到美国以后我们将要为一个新的美国而工作。这个新的美国是千百万美国男女劳动者所应该有的，他们强烈地反对战争挑拨者和剥削者，他们是美国的真正希望。
    历时四天的国际妇女大会，呈现了一幅清晰的图画：社会主义国家中的妇女的“昨天”，仍旧是许多其他国家中的妇女的“今天”。但是那些站在最前列的妇女的“今天”会成为一些不幸的姊妹们的“明天”，这是无可怀疑的。为一个更光明的“明天”携手并进的日子是一定要到来的。
