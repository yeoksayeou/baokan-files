Comrades and Representatives:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program.

In 1959, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country achieved a continuous Great Leap Forward in the national economy on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward. This excellent situation in socialist construction has also driven the rapid development of postal and telecommunications work. In 1959 alone, the volume of postal and telecommunications business increased by 45%. Now, postal service establishments are more widespread, and the postal and telecommunications network has further extended to the rural areas and border regions of the motherland. More and more people are sending letters, subscribing to newspapers, remitting money, sending telegrams, and making phone calls. On average, more than 100 million people have contact with the postal and telecommunications departments every day. The role of postal and telecommunications in the national economy and the political, economic, and cultural lives of the broad masses of people is becoming increasingly significant. The national postal and telecommunications workers, holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, have cheerfully taken on the communications tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people. A thousand hearts, ten thousand hearts, everything for the Great Leap Forward. Busy communications are a manifestation of the flourishing socialist cause. The busier the work, the greater the enthusiasm. All of this reflects the strong desire and heroic spirit of our country's postal and telecommunications workers to go all out, aim high, and build socialism at high speed. The national postal and telecommunications workers are developing and improving postal and telecommunications service with such full political enthusiasm.

Serving the communications needs of the industrial and agricultural Great Leap Forward is the central link in the service work of the postal and telecommunications departments. The postal and telecommunications departments regard guaranteeing communications for steel, coal, grain, and cotton as an important communications task assigned to them by the Party and the people, rapidly increasing postal and telecommunications facilities, organizing communications for industrial bases, and expanding the postal and telecommunications network in rural areas. Postal and telecommunications workers regard serving as communications soldiers for steel, coal, grain, and cotton as the greatest honor, going wherever the Party directs. In serving industry, the construction of the national postal and telecommunications trunk network has paid attention to adapting to the industrial layout. Some of our country's industrial cities today did not have long-distance telephone and telegram services in the past, and some did not even have postal and telecommunications facilities. Through vigorous transformation and construction over the past few years, these situations have fundamentally changed, and further improvements have been made since the Great Leap Forward. Not only do industrial cities have postal and telecommunications facilities, but every construction site has either postal and telecommunications facilities or organized mobile services. Not only have long-distance communications been improved in key industrial bases, but local telephone services have also increased accordingly. Not only are there general communications facilities, but modern, high-efficiency communications equipment has also been adopted. In serving agriculture, since the people's communes in rural areas, tremendous changes have taken place in the vast countryside, making it imperative to use postal and telecommunications as a powerful weapon for seizing every minute and second in the Great Leap Forward. This has driven the development of rural postal and telecommunications work. The people's communes in rural areas have brought about tremendous development in rural postal and telecommunications, fundamentally changing the service appearance of rural postal and telecommunications. Within two years, the number of rural postal and telecommunications service establishments has multiplied, telephone lines have reached 1.6 million pole kilometers, and 820,000 telephones of various types have been installed. Some areas that had never used telephones before not only have telephones now, but can also hold meetings on the phone. The broad masses of farmers can now send letters and subscribe to newspapers without leaving their teams or villages. Leading organs of county committees and communes use telephone conferences to arrange work, which can spread to every village in the county and commune in just a few hours, and the broad masses of farmers quickly take action. Now, almost all rural people's communes, most production brigades, and some production teams can have telephones or hold telephone conferences. Every day, tens of thousands of rural postal workers travel millions of kilometers on postal routes, delivering letters and newspapers to the broad masses of farmers, selling stamps, receiving and sending letters, and delivering packages and remittances to their doorsteps, just like a mobile post office. One commune cadre happily stroked the telephone after making a call, saying, "It's so convenient to have a telephone, no need to run or climb hills, whether it's a notice or a report, a turn of the handle and the matter is settled." Some masses praised, "Subscribe to the newspaper without leaving the door, know what's happening in the world, and have more energy for production." After rectification in 1959, the postal and telecommunications work of the people's communes further improved in communications management, network organization, and labor organization, which further facilitated the leadership of rural work at all levels, while also saving a large amount of labor for rural areas.

In the struggle against floods and droughts, postal and telecommunications workers joined the local people in actively engaging in the battle, doing everything possible to ensure the smooth flow of telephone lines and the timely delivery of letters and newspapers. "Wherever there is a water conservancy army, there is postal and telecommunications service," and "Wherever the water conservancy headquarters is, the telephone will be connected there" have become the slogans of postal and telecommunications workers. For example, in 1959, Henan Province postal and telecommunications workers, in guaranteeing communications for agricultural production and drought resistance, rushed to erect more than 25,500 kilometers of telephone lines, installed nearly 700 conference telephones, added 400 facilities, and organized 220,000 person-times of mobile service. For example, in this year, Guangdong and other provinces encountered extraordinarily large floods, and postal and telecommunications workers fought day and night, not avoiding hardships and dangers at critical moments, and not leaving the front line, thereby ensuring that Party and government leading organs could smoothly use postal and telecommunications to direct the struggle for disaster relief.

In the food poisoning incident involving sixty-one class brothers in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, postal and telecommunications workers, like workers in other departments, actively participated in this struggle. Although the phone call from Pinglu to Beijing had to be transferred through several places, thanks to the high degree of class love displayed by the telephone operators along the way, close cooperation, and unified pace, this long-distance call, which was more than 1,000 miles away, was available whenever needed, winning valuable time for rescuing the sixty-one brothers who suffered from food poisoning.

How has the significant improvement in postal and telecommunications service work been achieved? This is the result of the mass movement carried out under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The General Line for socialist construction, formulated based on the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, takes the people as the creators of history and the people as the most active factor in the productive forces as its starting point. Once the national postal and telecommunications workers grasped the spirit of the General Line and gave full play to their initiative and creativity, a vigorous upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward would be set off everywhere, forming a huge material force. Under the light of the General Line, their communist ideological consciousness has been greatly improved, they have vigorously engaged in collaboration, vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution, and actively promoted and participated in the reform of enterprise management, thereby significantly improving postal and telecommunications service work and creating a situation of sustained Great Leap Forward in postal and telecommunications service work.

In the postal and telecommunications process, close cooperation between the upper and lower links plays a significant role in improving communication quality. The speed of delivering a letter depends on the joint efforts of each bureau and station on the postal route, as well as the close collaboration of transportation departments such as railways, highways, and shipping. The speed of connecting a long-distance telephone call depends on the close cooperation of operators in two or more bureaus, and sometimes also on the mutual cooperation of institutions and enterprises equipped with telephone switchboards. Therefore, the postal and telecommunications department is the department that most needs to organize cooperation. With the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of postal and telecommunications workers and the continuous strengthening of the idea of communist large-scale collaboration, cooperative activities have become increasingly frequent, and the "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration competition has emerged. Since 1959, the postal and telecommunications department has launched a "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration competition centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, aiming to improve communication quality and labor productivity. Since the launch of the movement, the mental outlook of postal and telecommunications workers has been completely renewed. The noble communist style of leaving difficulties to oneself and sending convenience to others; putting the collective first and the individual second; breaking down departmentalism and establishing the overall situation has been greatly promoted, thereby significantly improving communication quality and labor productivity. For example, when making long-distance calls, operators in two locations must occupy some time on the line to contact each other in order for the people who want to make and receive calls to talk. In the past, sometimes the contact time between operators on both sides would occupy more than 30 minutes in an hour, that is to say, the actual time available for users to talk in an hour was less than 30 minutes. In the "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration competition, the contact time between operators on both sides has generally been shortened. Comrade Tian Lijuan, a national advanced producer and telephone operator from the Shanghai Bureau, closely cooperated with the telephone operator from the Beijing Bureau, learning from each other and helping each other, creating a national record of shortening the time occupied by operators to two minutes within an hour, which is equivalent to one circuit playing the role of two or even several circuits. For example, in order to speed up mail delivery, employees on the Xinjiang automobile postal route closely cooperated and created a national record of driving 880 kilometers continuously for 24 hours day and night, which is equivalent to one car playing the role of three cars, greatly shortening the delivery time of newspapers from Urumqi to Hetian. Before liberation, it took three months to transport mail from Urumqi to Hetian, which is two thousand miles away, but now it only takes two and a half days.

Currently, this "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration competition has been further developed with the support and cooperation of fraternal departments. Many local postal and telecommunications enterprises have established new cooperative relationships with railways, highways, civil aviation, newspaper offices and other departments, and institutions and enterprises equipped with telephone switchboards, and have organized "one-dragon" competitions, further improving postal and telecommunications service work. For example, the Harbin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Heilongjiang Province launched a "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration competition with the Railway Bureau, reducing the newspaper consignment procedures from six to one, and also breaking the conventional delivery time. As long as the train has not departed, the newspaper can be delivered, which guarantees the timely delivery of Party newspapers. On the line from Jiamusi to Shenyang, newspapers sent to seven counties and cities were delivered half a day to a day earlier. Many employees participating in the competition reflected: "We are one family, there is no distinction between you, me, and him, I help you when you are busy, and I participate when you are busy. The branch leads, and the collaboration is powerful." The relationship between people has undergone profound changes, and this communist spirit of large-scale collaboration has brought great convenience to people who use postal and telecommunications services.

In order to improve service and adapt to the communication needs of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, postal and telecommunications workers across the country have broken down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and established lofty ambitions, full of spirit and soaring enthusiasm, doing it themselves, carrying out tool reforms, running industries in a big way, and manufacturing communication equipment. If there are no materials, they find them themselves; if there are no machine tools, they make them themselves; if there is no technology, they learn while doing. They said: "Ants can gnaw bones, and we can also make machines." Over the past year or so, small and medium-sized factories starting from scratch have been consolidated, technical forces have been trained, and various indigenous equipment used in communications, especially in rural communications, has been manufactured, laying a material foundation for the further transformation of postal and telecommunications technology. Taking carrier machines as an example, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions can now basically manufacture them themselves. A carrier machine is a relatively advanced and precise telecommunications equipment. Originally, a pair of wires could only allow two people to talk to each other at the same time. After installing a carrier machine, the number of people who can talk on the phone at the same time can be increased many times without increasing the lines, making the communication capacity multiply or even increase by more than ten times. At present, about half of the carrier machines on long-distance telephone circuits were manufactured by postal and telecommunications workers themselves during the Great Leap Forward. For example, postal and telecommunications enterprises in Changli, Hebei, and Gaochun, Jiangsu, have also used locally-made carrier machines in rural telecommunications, which has created a good start for the carrierization of circuits from the county to the commune. The result of innovating equipment and tools has also significantly improved service quality and labor productivity. For example, postal and telecommunications bureaus in Wei County, Hebei Province, and Chaoyang, Liaoning Province, have reformed the performance of equipment and transformed the telecommunications network, so that rural circuits can still be used for telephone calls when broadcasting is open, and there is no mutual interference. In many places, the business departments have abandoned abacuses for the complicated work of calculating fees and switched to using instruments, which has saved manpower and shortened users' waiting time, and is very popular. Recently, the postal and telecommunications department held a national technical performance competition, where dozens of sets of experiences were introduced. Further promotion of these experiences will further improve postal and telecommunications service work.

The continuous improvement of postal and telecommunications service work forces management work to keep up. In order to make the relations of production more adapted to the development of productive forces, the postal and telecommunications department, like other industrial and transportation departments, has reformed unreasonable rules and regulations according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, implemented the system of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management, and adopted the method of combining cadres, workers, and technicians, and large-scale internal and external collaboration in production activities. This has changed the mutual relationship between leaders and the led, and between people in production activities, uniting the upper and lower levels, and making enterprises as close as one family, thereby further stimulating the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees and promoting the further improvement of postal and telecommunications service work.

The postal and telecommunications service work has also achieved a continuous Great Leap Forward for two consecutive years, once again proving the infinite power of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The achievements we have made should all be attributed to the Party and Chairman Mao, and to the broad masses of workers. We must continue to bravely advance along this road to victory in the future.

We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching on the principle of combining continuous revolution and the stage of revolutionary development, and regard the existing achievements as a new starting point for striving for greater achievements. We must see that the foundation of postal and telecommunications is still weak, that it cannot fully adapt to the increasing objective communication needs, and that the quality of postal and telecommunications communications needs to be further improved. All of these require us to further carry out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, resolutely implement the points pointed out for postal and telecommunications work in the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, strengthen the organization of communications, improve the transmission efficiency of postal and telecommunications, improve the end-to-end efficiency of communication work, complete the construction of trunk communications and the technical transformation of key networks, and especially strengthen the construction and management of rural communications in order to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, ensure service for the Party's central work, and serve the communication needs of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the national economy. The national postal and telecommunications workers must closely unite around the Party, hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong even higher, hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes even higher, continue to go all out, further improve service work, and serve as a good communications soldier in the Great Leap Forward of the national economy.

    高举红旗当好国民经济大跃进的通信兵
    邮电部部长朱学范的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和谭震林副总理关于为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。
    1959年，我国各族人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了国民经济继续大跃进。这种社会主义建设的大好形势，也带动了邮电工作的迅速发展。1959年一年的邮电业务量增长了45％。现在，邮电服务机构更加普遍，邮电网路进一步伸向祖国的各个农村和边疆，各地寄信、订报、汇款、发电报、打电话的人越来越多，平均每天有一亿多人次和邮电部门接触。邮电通信在国民经济中和广大人民政治、经济、文化生活中的作用越来越显著。全国邮电职工高举着毛泽东思想的红旗，高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，兴高采烈地把党和人民所交给他们的通信任务担负起来了。千条心、万条心，一切为了大跃进，通信繁忙是社会主义欣欣向荣的表现，工作越忙，劲头越大。这都反映了我国邮电职工鼓足干劲，力争上游，高速度建设社会主义的强烈愿望和豪迈气概。全国邮电职工就是以这种饱满的政治热情来发展和提高邮电服务工作的。
    为工业大跃进和农业大跃进的通信需要服务，是邮电部门服务工作的中心环节。邮电部门把保证钢、煤、粮、棉的通信，作为党和人民所交给他们的重要通信任务，迅速地增设了邮电机构、组织了工业基地的通信，扩大了农村的邮电网路。邮电职工以当好钢、煤、粮、棉的通信兵为莫大的光荣，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里。在为工业服务方面，全国邮电的干线网路建设，注意了与工业布局相适应。我国今天的这些工业城市，在过去有些是不通长途电话电报的，有些邮电机构也没有。几年来，经过大力改造和建设，这些情况从根本上有了改变，大跃进以来，更有了进一步改善。不仅工业城市有了邮电机构，而且在每个工地都有了邮电机构或者组织了流动服务；重要工业基地不仅长途通信有了改进，市内电话也有了相应的增加；不仅有了一般的通信设备，而且采用了现代化的高效率的通信设备。在为农业服务方面，农村人民公社化以来，广大农村发生了翻天复地的变化，迫切需要把邮电通信作为大跃进争分夺秒的有力武器，这样就把农村邮电工作带动起来了。农村人民公社化，使农村邮电通信事业取得了巨大发展，从根本上改变了农村邮电的服务面貌。在两年的时间内，农村邮电服务机构有了成倍的增长，电话线路已达一百六十万杆程公里，各种性能的电话机安装了八十二万部。过去从来没有用过电话的地区，有的不仅通了电话，而且可以在电话上开会了；广大农民寄信订报，已经可以不出队不出村了；县委和公社的领导机关用电话会议布置工作，只要几个小时就可以传遍全县全社的各个乡村，广大农民群众迅速地行动起来。现在，几乎所有的农村人民公社、大部分生产大队和部分生产队都可以通电话，或者举行电话会议。全国数万农村邮递人员，每天在几百万公里的邮路上，为广大农民送信送报，并出售邮票、收寄信件，把包裹、汇款送上门，好像一个流动的邮局一样。一个公社干部在一次打通电话的时候，高兴地抚摸着电话机说：“有了电话方便多，不跑路来不爬坡，无论通知和汇报，动手一摇事办妥。”有的群众称赞说：“订报不出门，晓得天下事，生产更有劲。”1959年人民公社的邮电工作经过整顿以后，通信管理、网路组织和劳动组织都有了进一步的改善，这就进一步便利了各级领导对农村工作的领导，同时也为农村节约了大批的劳动力。
    在防汛、抗旱等斗争中，邮电职工同当地人民一起，积极投入战斗，千方百计地保证了电话的畅通和信报的及时投递。“哪里有水利大军，哪里就有邮电服务”、“水利指挥部在哪里，电话就架到哪里”已经成为邮电职工的行动口号。如1959年河南省邮电职工，在保证农业生产建设和抗旱的通信中，就抢架了电话线两万五千五百多公里，安装会议电话机近七百部，增设机构四百处，组织流动服务二十二万人次。又如这一年广东等省遇到了特大的洪水，邮电职工日夜奋战，在紧急关头，不避艰险，不下火线，从而保证了党政领导机关顺利地使用邮电指挥抢险斗争。
    在山西省平陆县六十一个阶级弟兄食物中毒事件中，邮电职工也同其他部门的职工一样，积极参加了这个斗争。从平陆到北京的电话虽然要经过好几个地方接转，但由于沿途各局的话务人员发挥了高度阶级友爱精神，密切配合，步调一致，使这个相距一千多里的长途电话随要随通，为抢救六十一个食物中毒的阶级弟兄赢得了宝贵的时间。
    邮电服务工作的显著改善，是怎样得来的呢？这是在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，这是在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三个法宝的指引下，大搞群众运动的结果。根据马克思列宁主义普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，制定的社会主义建设的总路线，是以人民为历史的创造者、人民是生产力最活跃的因素为出发点的，全国邮电职工一经掌握了总路线的精神，充分发挥了积极性和创造性，就会到处掀起蓬蓬勃勃的学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的热潮，形成巨大的物质力量。他们在总路线的照耀下，共产主义思想觉悟大大提高，他们大搞协作，大闹技术革新和技术革命，积极促进和参加了企业管理的改革，从而显著地改善了邮电服务工作，使邮电服务工作出现了持续大跃进的局面。
    在邮电通信过程中，上下环节的密切配合，对于提高通信质量，有重大作用。一封信送的快慢，要靠邮路上的各局、各站的协作配合共同努力，还要靠铁路、公路、航运等交通部门的密切协作。一个长途电话接的快慢要两个或者两个以上局的话务员密切配合，有的还要靠装有电话总机的机关企业互相协作。所以邮电部门是最需要组织协作的一个部门。随着邮电职工政治觉悟不断提高，共产主义大协作思想不断加强，协作活动日益频繁，一条龙大协作的竞赛也就应运而生。1959年以来，邮电部门开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心，以提高通信质量和劳动生产率为目的的一条龙大协作竞赛。运动开展以来，邮电职工精神面貌焕然一新。留困难给自己，送方便给别人；先集体，后个人；破本位，立大局等高尚的共产主义风格大大发扬，从而显著地提高了通信质量和劳动生产率。例如：打长途电话，两地的话务员必须在电路上占用一些时间互相联系，才能使要电话和接电话的人通话。过去有时一个小时双方话务员联络的时间要占用三十多分钟，也就是说一小时实际供用户通话的时间不到三十分钟，在一条龙大协作竞赛中，一般都缩短了双方话务员的联络时间，全国先进生产者、上海局话务员田丽娟同志同北京局话务员密切协作，互学互助，创造了一个小时之内话务员占用的时间缩短到两分钟的全国最高纪录，这就相当于一条电路起了两条甚至几条电路的作用。再如，为了加速邮件传递，新疆汽车邮路上的职工密切协作，创造了日夜兼程连续二十四小时行车八百八十公里的全国最高纪录。等于一辆车发挥了三辆车的作用，使乌鲁木齐到和阗的报纸传递时间大大提前。解放前从乌鲁木齐运往二千里外和阗的邮件要三个月，现在只要两天半就可以到达了。
    目前，这种一条龙大协作竞赛得到了兄弟部门的支援和配合，有了进一步发展。各地不少邮电企业，同铁路、公路、民航、报刊社等部门和装有电话总机的机关企业建立了新的协作关系，分别组织了一条龙竞赛，进一步改善了邮电服务工作。例如，黑龙江省哈尔滨邮电局同铁路局开展了一条龙大协作竞赛，使报纸的托运手续由六道减为一道，交运时间也打破了常规，只要火车没有开，报纸就可以交运，这就保证党报的及时运送。在佳木斯到沈阳这一条线上，送往七个县、市的报纸都提早了半天到一天。许多参加竞赛的职工反映：“我们是一家，不分你、我、他，我忙你帮助，你忙我参加，支部来领导，协作力量大”。人与人的关系已经发生了深刻的变化，这种共产主义大协作精神，给使用邮电的人带来了很大的方便。
    为了改善服务，适应国民经济大跃进的通信需要，全国邮电职工破除了迷信，解放了思想，树雄心、立大志、意气风发、干劲冲天，自己动手，进行工具改革，大办工业，制造通信设备。没有材料自己找，没有机床自己造，没有技术就边干边学。他们说：“蚂蚁能够啃骨头，我们也能造机器”。一年多来，白手起家的中小型工厂得到了巩固，培养了技术力量，通信上使用的特别是农村通信使用的各种洋土设备制造出来了，为邮电通信技术的进一步改造打下了物质基础。以载波机为例，现在各省、市、自治区基本上都能自己制造了。载波机是一种比较高级的精密的电信设备，本来一对电线，在同一时间内，只能供两个人互相通话，安装载波机以后，线路不增加而同时通电话的人却可增加很多，使通信能力成倍甚至十几倍的增长。目前长途电话电路上载波机大约有一半是邮电职工在大跃进中自己制造的。如河北昌黎、江苏高淳等邮电企业，在农村电信上也使用了本县自制的载波机，这就为实现县到公社电路的载波化创造了良好的开端。革新设备工具的结果也显著地提高了服务质量和劳动生产率。如河北省蔚县、辽宁省朝阳等邮电局，改革了设备的性能，改造了电信网路，就使农村电路在开放广播的时候，仍然能够通电话，而且互不干扰。许多地方的营业部门对于繁杂的计算费用的工作，丢掉了算盘，改用了仪表，就节约了人力缩短了用户的等候时间，很受欢迎。最近，邮电部门召开了一次全国性的技术表演比赛大会，会上介绍了数十套经验，这些经验进一步推广后，将使邮电服务工作得到进一步改善。
    邮电服务工作的不断改善，它就迫使管理工作也必须跟上去。为了使生产关系更加适应生产力的发展，邮电部门也和其他工业交通部门一样，按照党中央的指示，改革了不合理的规章制度，实行了干部参加劳动、工人参加管理的制度，并且在生产活动中采用了干部、工人、技术人员三结合、内外大协作的办法。这就改变了领导与被领导以及人与人在生产活动中的相互关系，上下打成一片，企业之间亲如一家，从而进一步激发了广大职工的生产热情，促进了邮电服务工作的进一步改善。
    邮电服务工作也实现了连续两年的大跃进，又一次证明了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝的无限威力。我们取得的成就都应归功于党和毛主席，归功于广大职工群众。我们今后还要沿着这条胜利的道路奋勇前进。
    我们必须遵循毛主席教导的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，把已有的成绩当作争取更大成绩的新起点。必须看到邮电的基础还是薄弱的，对于日益增长的客观通信需要还不能完全适应，邮电通信质量还需要进一步提高。这些都需要我们进一步开展以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，坚决贯彻执行李富春副总理和谭震林副总理报告中对邮电工作所指出的各点。加强通信的组织工作，提高邮电的传输效能，提高通信工作的全程效率，完成干线的通信建设和重点网路的技术改造，特别要为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而加强农村通信的建设和管理，保证为党的中心工作服务，为国民经济持续大跃进的通信需要服务。全国邮电职工必须紧紧地团结在党的周围，更高地举起毛泽东的红旗，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，继续鼓足干劲，进一步改善服务工作，当好国民经济大跃进的通信兵。
