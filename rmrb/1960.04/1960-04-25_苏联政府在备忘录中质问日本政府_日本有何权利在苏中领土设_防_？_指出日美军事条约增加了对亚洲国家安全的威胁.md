Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd: According to TASS, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko handed Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Toshikazu Kadowaki, a memorandum on April 22nd, reiterating the Soviet government's position on the signing of the U.S.-Japan military treaty. The memorandum once again pointed out that the Japanese government will bear all the consequences arising from the signing of the U.S.-Japan military treaty.

The Soviet government's memorandum is a response to the Japanese government's memorandum of March 1st.

The memorandum points out that the Japanese government's assertion in its memorandum to the Soviet Union that the new U.S.-Japan military treaty is for defensive purposes is a groundless argument that cannot conceal the treaty's militaristic and aggressive nature.

The memorandum states that the Japanese government evades answering the question: when no one is threatening Japan, who does it intend to defend against; while its neighbors—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, deeply concerned about peace—have repeatedly put forward practical and feasible proposals aimed at effectively ensuring the security of the entire Far East region, including Japan, in the past and present.

The memorandum states that it is clear from this that the Japanese government signed the new military treaty not out of the need for national defense, but in connection with the policies of certain military blocs that threaten the security of peace-loving countries.

The memorandum states that the Japanese side is now undertaking the following responsibilities: expanding military potential, cooperating with foreign armed forces, and jointly protecting foreign military bases in Japan from retaliation. The Japanese government is openly adopting a policy of rearming Japan and is developing the situation in such a direction that, regardless of the will of its own people, it may be drawn into military conflicts that will inevitably bring disaster to Japan.

The memorandum points out that it can be seen from the repeated talks of some Japanese government officials that the scope of the new U.S.-Japan military treaty is by no means limited to the islands of Japan, but has been extended to territories far from the Japanese border, including the territories of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. But, may I ask: what right does the Japanese government have to establish "defense" for other people's territory?

The memorandum states that, in reality, Japan is now confronting those peace-loving countries in Asia that follow the Bandung spirit, safeguard the path of independent development, do not participate in military treaties, and pursue a neutral policy. When Japan binds itself with a new military treaty, it becomes a participant in Asian military aggression blocs, which increases the threat to the security of the people of Asian countries.

The memorandum states that the Japanese government's action of concluding a new military treaty is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of October 19, 1956. Japan is embarking on activities that endanger the security of the Soviet Union and worsen Soviet-Japanese relations.

The memorandum then points out that the Soviet government considers it unnecessary to elaborate in detail its position on the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island, as it has been stated in past memorandums. The Japanese government's repeated unfounded demands for territories belonging to the Soviet Union, and its insistence that, according to the Joint Declaration, both sides agreed that the territorial issue was to be further discussed, are untrue. The biased propaganda surrounding the territorial issue in Japan is only to intensify Soviet-Japanese relations.

### 苏联政府在备忘录中质问日本政府  日本有何权利在苏中领土设“防”？  指出日美军事条约增加了对亚洲国家安全的威胁

    苏联政府在备忘录中质问日本政府
    日本有何权利在苏中领土设“防”？
    指出日美军事条约增加了对亚洲国家安全的威胁
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯22日交给日本驻苏联大使门胁季光一份备忘录，重申苏联政府对签订日美军事条约的立场。备忘录再一次指出，由于签订日美军事条约而产生的一切后果，将全部由日本政府负责。
    苏联政府的这份备忘录，是对日本政府3月1日的备忘录的答复。
    这份备忘录指出，日本政府在给苏联的备忘录中硬说新的日美军事条约是以防御为目的的，这种毫无根据的论点并不能掩盖住条约的军国主义的侵略性质。
    备忘录说，日本政府以沉默来规避回答这样一个问题：在没有任何人威胁日本的时候，它打算防御谁；而它的近邻——深切关心和平的苏联和中华人民共和国过去和现在一再提出旨在有效地保证包括日本在内的整个远东地区的安全的切实可行的建议。
    备忘录说，由此可见，日本政府签订新的军事条约，决非出于国防的需要，而是与威胁爱好和平国家的安全的某些军事集团的政策相联系着的。
    备忘录说，日本方面现在正在承担下列责任：扩充军事潜力、同外国武装部队合作，并同它们共同保护外国在日本的军事基地免受回击。日本政府正在公开地采取重新武装日本的方针，并且正在使事态向这样一个方向发展，即不顾它本国人民的意志，可能卷入必然使日本遭到灾难的军事冲突中去。
    备忘录指出，从日本政府的一些官员的多次谈话中可以看出，新的日美军事条约发生作用的范围决不仅限于日本的岛屿，而且扩大到了远离日本国境的领土，其中包括苏联和中华人民共和国的领土。但是，试问：日本政府有什么权利为别人的领土设“防”？
    备忘录说，实际上，日本现在是对抗亚洲那些遵循万隆精神、维护独立发展道路、不参加军事条约和执行中立政策的爱好和平的国家。当日本用新的军事条约把自己束缚起来的时候，它就变成亚洲军事侵略集团的参与者，这就增加了对亚洲国家人民的安全的威胁。
    备忘录说，日本政府缔结新军事条约这一行动是同1956年10月19日的苏日联合宣言的精神和条文相矛盾的。日本正在着手进行危害苏联的安全和恶化苏日两国关系的勾当。
    备忘录接着指出，苏联政府认为没有必要详细地阐明它对齿舞群岛和色丹岛的立场，因为过去的备忘录已经申述过了。日本政府对属于苏联的领土再次提出毫无根据的要求，并且硬说，根据联合宣言，双方一致认为领土问题有待于进一步讨论，这种说法是不真实的。日本国内围绕领土问题所掀起的有倾向性的宣传，只是为了使苏日关系紧张化。
