Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 14th: Hunan Province, during the spring plowing production, transferred 150,000 cadres from all levels of government to people's communes and production teams, going deep into the work groups to participate in production and lead production. After these cadres went down, they promoted the current production movement, further strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses, and the cadres' work style of seeking truth from facts and following the mass line has also greatly developed. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) requires party committees at all levels to continue to adhere to this practice and make it a regular and universal working method.

On the basis of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, Hunan Province will continue to organize and achieve a greater leap forward this year. In order to realize this grand plan, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee decided in late February to transfer 100,000 cadres throughout the province to go deep into the work groups to strengthen the leadership of the front line of spring plowing production. After the Provincial Party Committee's decision was issued, it was warmly supported by the broad masses of cadres and people. Now, every production team in the province has an average of one cadre dispatched this time. Among the cadres who went down, there were 32 prefectural party committee secretaries and members, 1,040 county party committee secretaries and members, and 7,700 commune party committee secretaries and members. After the party secretaries at all levels went down, they all went deep into one point, dissected "sparrows," summarized experience, and guided the overall situation.

After the cadres arrived at the teams and groups, they first participated in production and led production, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses. They combined with experienced farmers and technicians to establish more than 4.7 million mu of large-area high-yield demonstration fields as a base for guiding large-scale production, as well as high-yield comparative experiments of various crops. These demonstration fields led in every aspect of the work, playing a huge role in promoting the large-area high-yield movement. After the broad masses of cadres went deep down, they also promptly discovered problems and mobilized the masses to solve them in a timely manner. When Meng Zhaohe, First Secretary of the Guiyang County Party Committee, went to the Ou Jia Brigade of Jiantou Commune, he found that 800 mu of the team's fields had not been plowed due to the spring drought, and some people had the idea of "waiting for rain." Meng Zhaohe immediately enlightened the masses to recognize the importance of seizing the season and plowing the fields early for increasing production, and then discussed with the masses on ways to overcome the drought. He himself led more than 180 people to split two mountain peaks and dig a seven-mile canal, solving the water shortage problem for these 800 mu of land. Later, the county promoted their practice of digging canals and plowing fields, setting off a high tide of digging canals to divert water and plowing fields. In less than ten days, 110,000 mu of the county's 180,000 mu of land that had not been plowed due to water shortage was irrigated and plowed.

While strengthening the front line of spring plowing production, party committees at all levels in Hunan Province have paid great attention to strengthening the leadership of poor teams, backward teams, and low-yield areas. Party committees at all levels have formulated specific plans for the poor to catch up with the rich, the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the low-yield to catch up with the high-yield, according to the different conditions of these areas, and adopted effective measures. The Xiangtan area dispatched a total of 40 county party committee members and more than 1,800 commune party committee secretaries and stronger cadres to poor teams and backward teams to take on leadership positions. The Xiangyin County Party Committee also convened a meeting of cadres from 50 poor and backward teams in the county in the Bishi Commune Songjiang Brigade, which had already changed its backward appearance, to summarize and promote the experience of this brigade in changing from poor to rich. Now, the face of the poor and backward teams in the county has greatly changed.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 14th: Leading cadres at all levels in Sichuan Province have gone to the countryside and factories to lead production at the forefront, effectively promoting the overall high tide of industrial and agricultural production in the province.

The First Secretary and Secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee went to remote areas such as Xiushan to inspect production. Another group of leading cadres above the level of directors and deputy directors of provincial-level agencies went deep into the countryside and factories to lead production. A large number of leading cadres from various regions, counties, and districts have also gone deep down. In the Neijiang area, there were more than 50 leading cadres above the level of prefectural party committee secretaries, commissioners, ministers, and section chiefs going to the countryside and factories. The Steel Office of the Mianyang Prefectural Party Committee, led by Peng Hua, the Second Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, moved to Guangyuan County, a key iron-producing county, to work, and the steel offices of the county party committees also moved to the hundreds-of-tons furnace groups. According to statistics from only the four areas of Nanchong, Neijiang, Yibin, and Wanxian, more than 48,000 cadres have gone deep into the front line of production.

Leading cadres at all levels have paid special attention to going deep into backward areas or departments to strengthen the leadership of weak links, thereby promoting a comprehensive upsurge in production. Li Linzhi, First Secretary of the Mianyang Prefectural Party Committee of the CPC, went to Santai, Suining and other places to help the masses summarize and promote six kinds of experience in cultivating early corn, so that the early corn planting movement in the entire area rapidly and comprehensively unfolded. The secretaries of the CPC Regional Party Committee and the county party committees in charge of industry in this region all went deep into the long-term low-yield hundred-ton furnace groups to sit and make breakthroughs. Every three-hundred-ton furnace group in the entire area quickly broke through the level of one hundred tons of iron per day. After Xu Wenzheng, First Secretary of the Rongchang County Party Committee of the CPC, went deep into the Zheng'an Commune, he found that the late-sown wheat was not growing well due to lack of water and fertilizer. Under his leadership, the next day the entire commune mobilized more than 2,400 people to rush to irrigate the wheat. In five days, the late-sown wheat was generally irrigated once, and more than 400 loads of clear night soil were applied per mu, and the production outlook quickly changed.

Due to the strengthening of leadership by leading cadres at all levels in the front line of production, the progress of various production tasks has been greatly accelerated. The total industrial output value and the main products such as steel, steel, pig iron, raw coal, copper, and lead in the first quarter of the province have all comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan, and the output and quality have been increasing month by month. More than 50 million mu of small spring crops in the province are growing better and better, and the spring sowing and other preparations are being carried out earlier and faster. The province's early corn sowing plan has been overfulfilled, and the work of raising seedlings for early rice and sweet potatoes has also been basically completed. Crops such as cotton, peanuts, and mid-season rice are being sown in large quantities, and the sowing quality is better than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, April 14th: Guangxi has recently transferred a large number of cadres to rural communes, production brigades, or production teams to take on leadership positions. According to preliminary statistics from the three regions of Liuzhou, Nanning, and Guilin at the end of March, more than 41,000 cadres have been transferred to rural grassroots units, and other regions have also transferred many cadres.

Various localities have transferred a portion of cadres to poor teams and backward teams to help these teams catch up with rich teams and change their backward appearance as soon as possible. Each county in the Baise area transferred more than 400 cadres from the financial departments to settle down in poor teams, helping the poor teams establish more than 200 industrial and sideline production bases, and planned to establish more than 9,400 factories (fields).

After the cadres from various localities arrived at the grassroots level, they shared weal and woe, breathed together with the masses, and discussed matters with the masses, which was deeply welcomed by the masses. The cadres who worked at the grassroots level in Laibin County implemented four similarities (eating, living, working, and discussing together), three deep dives (deep into the fields, deep into research to solve problems, deep into backward and remote areas), and two reliances (relying on party and league organizations, relying on poor and lower-middle peasants). The commune members praised them as "old land reform team cadres." Cao Changle, secretary of the Ying Shan Commune Party Committee in Luzhai, went to the Ban Village team of the Graphite Brigade and plowed the fields and harrowed the fields together with the commune members, leading the commune members of the entire team to work. The daily rice transplanting increased from 30 mu to more than 60 mu. After a large number of cadres in Tiandeng County went deep into the grassroots level, they generally worked for half a day and worked for half a day, ate in the canteen with the commune members, and promptly helped summarize the experience and promote it comprehensively, which quickly changed the production outlook of the entire county.

    加强生产第一线　推动生产大跃进
    湖南、四川、广西抽调大批干部深入基层参加生产领导生产
    据新华社长沙14日电　湖南省在春耕生产中，从全省各级机关到人民公社和各个生产队抽调了十五万名干部，深入到作业组去参加生产、领导生产。这些干部下去以后，推动了当前的生产运动，进一步密切了党和群众的联系，干部中实事求是、走群众路线的作风，也有很大发展。中共湖南省委要求各级党委把这种做法继续坚持下去，使之成为经常的、普遍的工作方法。
    湖南省在两年大跃进的基础上，今年继续组织实现更大的跃进。为了实现这一宏伟的计划，中共湖南省委2月下旬决定在全省抽调十万名干部深入到作业组，加强春耕生产第一线的领导。省委的决定下达以后，得到了广大干部和群众的热烈拥护。现在，全省平均每个生产队都有一名这次派下去的干部。下去的干部中，地委书记和委员有三十二人，县委书记和委员一千零四十人，公社党委书记和委员七千七百人，各级党委书记下去后，都深入一点，解剖“麻雀”，总结经验，指导全面。
    干部到队到组以后，首先做到了参加生产，领导生产，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。他们与老农、技术员相结合，共建立了大面积丰产指挥田四百七十多万亩，作为指导大生产的基地，还有各种作物的高产对比试验。这些指挥田项项工作都赶在前面，对大面积丰产运动起了巨大的推动作用。广大干部深入下去以后，还做到了及时发现问题，及时发动群众解决问题。桂阳县委第一书记孟昭鹤到枧头公社的欧家大队时，发现这个队因春旱有八百亩田未翻耕，部分群众存在“等天下雨”的思想。孟昭鹤当即启发群众认识抓季节、早翻田对增产的重大作用，然后和群众商量出了战胜干旱的办法，自己又带领一百八十多人劈开两个山头，开渠七里，解决了这八百亩田的缺水问题。后来全县推广了他们开渠翻田的做法，掀起了一个开渠引水翻田的高潮，不到十天，全县十八万亩因缺水未翻的田，就灌溉、翻耕了十一万亩。
    湖南省各级党委在加强春耕生产第一线的同时，都十分注意加强对穷队、后进队、低产区的领导。各级党委针对这些地区的不同情况，分别作出了穷赶富、落后赶先进、低产赶高产的具体规划，采取了有效的措施。湘潭专区共派出县委委员四十名、公社党委书记和较强的干部一千八百多名到穷队、后进队担任领导工作。湘阴县委还在已经改变后进面貌的弼时公社松江大队召开了全县五十个穷队、后进队的干部会，总结并推广这个大队由穷变富的经验。现在全县穷队、后进队的面貌，已经有了很大改变。
    新华社成都14日电　四川省各级领导干部纷纷下乡、下厂，深入生产第一线领导生产，有力地促进了全省工农业生产全面高涨。
    中共四川省委第一书记和书记处书记们，分别前往秀山等边远地区巡回检查生产。省级机关另有一批厅、局长以上领导干部深入到农村和工厂领导生产。各地、县、区也有大批领导干部深入下去。内江地区就有地委书记、专员、部长以及科局长以上领导干部五十多人下乡、下厂。绵阳地委钢铁办公室在地委第二书记彭华率领下，搬到重点产铁县广元县办公，各县委钢铁办公室也纷纷搬到百吨炉群办公。仅据南充、内江、宜宾、万县四个专区统计，就有四万八千多名干部深入到生产第一线。
    各级领导干部特别注意深入到落后地区或部门，加强对薄弱环节的领导，从而促进了生产全面高涨。中共绵阳地委第一书记李林枝，分别到三台、遂宁等地，帮助群众总结推广了六种栽培早玉米的经验，使全专区早玉米增种运动迅速全面展开。这个地区中共地委和各县县委主管工业的书记，都分别深入到长期低产的百吨炉群坐镇突击，全专区三个百吨炉群个个都迅速突破了日产百吨铁的水平。中共荣昌县委第一书记徐文正深入到正安公社后，发现迟播小麦长得不好，原因是缺水缺肥。在他率领下，第二天全社出动二千四百多人抢灌小麦，五天时间就将迟播小麦普遍浇灌一次，每亩施清水粪四百多挑，生产面貌迅速改变。
    由于各级领导干部深入生产第一线加强领导，各项生产进度大大加快。全省第一季度工业总产值和钢、钢材、生铁、原煤、铜、铅等主要产品，都已全面超额完成国家计划，产量、质量都逐月提高。全省五千多万亩小春作物越长越好，大春播种及其他各项准备工作进行得又早又快。全省早玉米播种计划已超额完成，早稻和红苕的育秧育苗工作也已经基本结束，棉花、花生、中稻等作物正在大量下种，播种质量比历年都好。
    据新华社南宁14日电　广西各地最近抽调大批干部到农村公社生产大队或生产队担任领导工作。据柳州、南宁、桂林三个专区到3月底的初步统计，已抽调四万一千多名干部到农村基层单位，其他各专区也都抽调了不少干部。
    各地都抽调一部分干部到穷队和后进队，帮助这些队尽快地赶上富队和改变落后面貌。百色专区各县从财政金融部门抽调四百多名干部到穷队安家落户，帮助穷队建立二百多个工业、副业生产基地，计划建立的工厂（场）达九千四百多个。
    各地干部到基层以后，都和群众同甘共苦、共呼吸，遇事同群众商量，深受群众欢迎。来宾县到基层工作的干部，实行四同（同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量）、三深入（深入田间、深入研究解决问题、深入后进和边远地区）、两依靠（依靠党团组织、依靠贫农下中农），社员称赞他们为“老土改队的干部”。鹿寨英山公社党委书记曹昌乐到石墨大队坂村小队后，同社员们一起犁田、耙田，带动全队社员出工，每天插秧由三十亩增加到六十多亩。天等县大批干部深入基层后，普遍做到半天工作，半天劳动，和社员一起在食堂吃饭，并且及时帮助总结经验全面推广，使全县生产面貌很快有了改变。
