The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a movement of ideological revolution, a process of ideological transformation. If the mind is not liberated, the technical innovation and technical revolution cannot be carried out, or if it is carried out, it cannot be thorough.

Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I have listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft. Both reports are to lay the foundation for the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960 and for the continued leap forward in the 1960s. They are comprehensive leap forward reports that inspire people, and I wholeheartedly support them. The continued great leap forward in 1960 is certain, and the continued great leap forward in the future is possible. Because the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has formed a comprehensive and nationwide movement, the vigorously developing situation is like ten thousand horses galloping, production is increasing day by day, and the leap forward is based on solid ground and reliable.

This spring, we visited Northeast China and went to three provinces and eight cities. We saw that the technical innovation and technical revolution in Liaoning Province was advancing towards "three-izations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation), demanding that one person do the work of two. On the principle of three "no's" (no increase in personnel, no increase in equipment, no increase in investment), this year's production must be doubled. The goal of eliminating heavy physical labor in the first quarter. By the end of February, there were more than 1.25 million suggestions on technical innovation and technical revolution, of which more than 270,000 had been realized, creating 1,490 automatic production lines, 5,549 linked lines, and 1,948 single-machine automation setups. The production rate increased greatly, and the industrial production plan for January and February was completed five days ahead of schedule. The output value in January increased by 17.8% compared with December last year, and the output value in February increased by another 5% compared with January, achieving a flying start and a red month every month.

Heilongjiang Province put forward "three new" (new situation, new stage, new tasks), "two reliance" (relying on the Party, relying on the masses), "two have" (have a center, have a backbone), "two comprehensive" (comprehensive planning, comprehensive leap forward), and a technical innovation and technical revolution movement advancing towards high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new. By the end of January, according to incomplete statistics, 358 automatic production lines, 424 linked lines, 2,012 single-machine automation setups, and 15,805 manual operation mechanization and semi-mechanization projects had emerged. The January production plan was completed seven days ahead of schedule, and the output value increased by 77% compared with the same period last year. The February production plan was completed five days ahead of schedule, and the output value in February increased by another 5% compared with January, achieving a flying start and a red month every month.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Jilin Province put forward "five-izations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and continuous production), "double doubling" (production doubled, equipment renewed), and "three improvements" (improving thought, improving culture and technology, improving enterprise management). Under the condition of four "no increases" (no increase in personnel, no increase in investment, no increase in factory buildings, no increase in equipment), the production capacity was doubled to tripled, and a flying start and a red month every month were also achieved, with output value increasing month by month.

Due to the continuous reform of production tools, continuous improvement of processes, and continuous improvement of operating methods, the production value of various factories and mines has increased day by day and month by month. Under this new situation of major change and major revolution, the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory wants to become five factories, the Jilin Chemical Factory wants to become four factories, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory will increase its production value three times compared with the original design in 1960, realizing one factory becoming four factories. The Harbin Electric Motor Factory doubled its total output compared with 1959, the Shenyang Cable Factory and the Standard Screw Factory both doubled their production with three "no's," and other enterprises are learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced in a hot and vigorous manner. The huge wave of innovation and revolution is like an atomic explosion. The Northeast is like this, and the whole country is a chessboard. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the whole country is also like this. This new situation has just begun, the wisdom of the broad masses is infinite, and technical innovation and technical revolution are also infinite. In this way, not only will 1960 be a year of leap forward, but also the 1960s will be an era of leap forward. Under the socialist system, holding high the red flag of the Great Leap Forward, there will always be continued leap forward in the future.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the Northeast is unfolding magnificently, with a strong momentum and wide participation, creating a huge wave. In the new stage of major change and major revolution, the focus of the movement has developed from sporadic and decentralized technical reforms to systematic and comprehensive technical transformation of enterprises. The movement has quickly developed from the production sector to the non-production sector. "Everyone uses their brains, everyone contributes ideas," "Everyone talks about innovation, everywhere engages in revolution," forming a nationwide movement of comprehensive technical innovation and technical revolution. For example, the Harbin Linen Factory, Electric Motor Factory, Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory, Shenyang Cable Factory, Heavy Machinery Factory, Anshan Iron and Steel, etc., are all modern large-scale enterprises, and they are all vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution. Anshan Iron and Steel had more than 357,000 suggestions for technical innovation and technical revolution from January to February 15, of which more than 65,000 had been realized. The Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory created 1,194 mechanization points, 1,396 automation points, 137 assembly lines, 160 automatic production lines, and 28 automatic combined machine tools in just over a month of technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The entire factory already has three workshops and six teams that are fully automated. The Harbin Linen Factory is a state-of-the-art equipment factory. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, by February 10, it had successfully created 16 automatic lines for flax scutching and combing, short flax combing and sliver making, and canvas shearing, as well as more than 40 other major technical innovations such as single-machine automation and mechanization. Other factories and mining enterprises are all undergoing major changes and major revolutions, and their achievements are very great. This shows that modern large-scale enterprises can undergo major changes and major reforms, while medium and small-sized enterprises can undergo major changes and major reforms even more brilliantly.

Not only the production sector is vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, but also the non-production sector is vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution. For example, the nannies in the nurseries created a children's "urine alarm." There is also the most outstanding Harbin "March 8th Restaurant," where the delivery of food and meals is automated, and the making of dumplings is continuous, with the entire process of kneading dough, pressing skins, and wrapping dumplings completed in one line, capable of wrapping 12,000 dumplings every hour. Stir-frying dishes, washing utensils, and other processes are automated or mechanized. There is also a leap from manual operation to automatic line, such as the "electronic automatic control metering instrument" created by the Changchun Xiuli Grain Store, which can complete the task without measuring or weighing grain or oil. There are many others, too numerous to mention. In this movement, whether large, medium, or small enterprises, modern enterprises or indigenous enterprises, are undergoing major changes and major revolutions. Whether production departments or non-production departments, are vigorously engaged in technical revolution and technical innovation. Whether male or female, old or young, educated or uneducated, with or without technology, all have opportunities for invention and creation, and all have grounds for invention and creation. This is an unprecedentedly good situation.

There are many products that have reached the world level and cutting-edge products in terms of creation and invention. Just to say a few of the most sophisticated, such as the Harbin "New Technology Experimental Building," which was built with four "no's" (no bricks, no cement, no wood, no steel bars). There are also "coal hurlers," "non-rock crushers," etc. Judging from the above facts, the flowers of technical innovation and technical revolution are truly "colorful," and they are blooming more and more brightly.

When the technical innovation and technical revolution movement was about to start, workers and masses voluntarily returned their train tickets during the Spring Festival holiday and did not go home to celebrate the festival, but wanted to eat dumplings on the automatic line. They worked tirelessly, engaging in production during the day and innovation at night. They said that the more they thought about it, the more daring they were to do it, and the more they did it, the more daring they were to think, and the more they thought about it, the more daring they were to think, and the more they did it, the more daring they were to do it, the more they thought about, and the bigger they did. What force is driving the workers and masses with this energy? The workers and masses said: "The general line produces the automatic line." From this sentence, we can understand how deeply the Party's general line has penetrated into people's hearts, with huge waves of major changes and major revolutions surging everywhere, and the immense light of the general line radiating everywhere.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the workers and masses said: "What foreigners can do, we can do, and what foreigners cannot do, we can also do," "What foreigners have, we must have, and what foreigners do not have, we must also have," "Listen to the Party, and everything will be happy. If the Party gives me a ladder, I dare to go to heaven." I was inspired by such revolutionary heroism and revolutionary pride.

The workers and masses have become "obsessed" with technical innovation and technical revolution. The employees of the "March 8th Restaurant" said: "Whatever we do, we want to innovate, and whatever we do, we want to create."

Dalian Port eliminated heavy physical labor such as carrying on the head, shoulders, and lifting in February. Shenyang and other cities have also basically eliminated heavy physical labor. The workers and masses said: "We used to squat to work, but now we have changed to standing to work, and soon we can change to sitting to work." The workers and masses believe that technical innovation and technical revolution is the "second liberation" of the working class. How profound and touching such voices are. Only the workers and masses can understand the significance of technical innovation and technical revolution so profoundly; the exploiting classes cannot understand it that way.

During this visit, I saw the infinite wisdom, selfless labor, revolutionary heroism, communist style, and communist collaboration of the broad masses of the working people. I saw their inventions and creations, I saw their great leap forward in culture and technology, and I saw their contributions to the country. New people and new things are constantly emerging, and I feel too small.

During this visit, I listened to more than 20 reports and countless introductions, all of which mentioned that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is not all smooth sailing, and there is always a struggle between conservatism and revolution, and a struggle between the advanced and the backward. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a movement of ideological revolution, a process of ideological transformation. If the mind is not liberated, the technical innovation and technical revolution cannot be carried out, or if it is carried out, it cannot be thorough. We must continue to implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, oppose right-leaning tendencies, and encourage vigor. We must carry out mass movements on a large scale under the leadership of the Party, give prominence to politics, in order to liberate our minds and improve our thinking. I received a profound education in ideological transformation.

The momentum of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is getting stronger and stronger, "one place blossoms and results everywhere," and "the situation is infinitely beautiful." This good situation is also a good situation for the transformation of bourgeois intellectuals. The Party is trying its best to hope that we will transform, and under today's new situation, we must accelerate the transformation, or we will fall behind. With today's good environment, good opportunities, and good grounds, we should hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward with great strides!

    技术革新运动有如万马奔腾
    张振汉委员的发言
    技术革新技术革命运动，就是思想革命运动，就是思想改造过程，思想不解放，技术革新技术革命开展不起来，或者开展起来也不能彻底主席、各位委员：
    我听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。这两个报告都是为1960年国民经济的继续跃进，为六十年代的继续跃进奠定基础的报告，是一个全面跃进鼓舞人心的报告，我衷心的拥护。1960年继续大跃进是肯定的，今后继续大跃进是可能的，由于技术革新技术革命运动形成了全面性和全民性的运动，蓬蓬勃勃开展的形势如万马奔腾，生产日日提高，跃进是有根据和可靠的。
    今春我们到东北参观，到了三个省八个城市，看见了辽宁省技术革新技术革命向“三化”进军（机械化、半机械化、自动化），要求一人当两人，在三不要的原则上（不要加人，不要加设备，不要加投资），今年生产要加番。在第一季度要消灭笨重的体力劳动的奋斗目标，到2月底已有一百二十五万多件关于技术革新技术革命的建议，实现的已有二十七万多件，创造成生产自动线一千四百九十条，联动线五千五百四十九条，单机自动化一千九百四十八台，生产率大2月份都提前五天完成工大的提高，今年1、业生产计划，1月份的产值比去年12月增长17.8％，2月份产值比1月份又提高5％，实现了开门红，月月红。
    黑龙江省提出“三新”（新形势、新阶段、新任务）、“两依”（依靠党、依靠群众）、“两有”（有中心、有骨干）、“两全”（全面规划、全面跃进），向高、大、精、尖、新进军的技术革新技术革命运动，到1月底不完全的统计，已出现生产自动线三百五十八条，联动线四百二十四条，单机自动化二千零一十二台，手工操作机械化半机械化一万五千八百零五项，1月份生产计划提前七天完成，比去年同时期的产值增长77％，2月份提前五天完成生产计划，2月份的产值比1月份又提高5％，作到了开门红、月月红。
    吉林省的技术革新技术革命运动，提出“五化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、联续化）、“双番”（生产加番、设备翻新），“三提高”（提高思想、提高文化技术、提高企业管理），在四不增（不增加人、不增加投资、不增加厂房、不增加设备）的情况下，使生产能力翻一番至三番，也实现了开门红、月月红、产值一月比一月提高。
    由于生产工具不断改革，工序不断改进，操作方法不断改善，各厂矿企业的生产值，一日比一日提高、一月比一月提高。在这个大改大革的新形势下，长春第一汽车厂，一厂要变五厂，吉林化工厂，一厂要变四厂，哈尔滨量具刃具厂1960年将比原设计生产值提高三倍，实现一厂变四厂，哈尔滨电机厂把总产品比1959年翻一番，沈阳电缆厂和标准螺钉厂，都是三不要而生产加一番，其他各企业都在学先进、比先进、赶先进、超先进的情况下，热火朝天的轰轰烈烈的进行着。那种革新革命的巨浪头，就像原子爆炸一样。东北如斯，全国一盘棋，在党统一领导下，全国亦是如斯。这个新形势才开端，广大群众智慧是无穷无尽的，而技术革新技术革命也是无穷无尽的。这样，不仅1960年是个跃进年，而且六十年代也是个跃进年代。在社会主义制度下，高举大跃进的红旗，今后永远会继续跃进的。
    东北的技术革新技术革命运动，在波澜壮阔地开展，来势很猛，参加的广泛声势浩大。在大改大革的新阶段，运动的锋芒由零星的分散的技术改革，发展到系统的全面的对企业进行技术改造，运动由生产部门很快的发展到非生产部门。“人人动脑筋，个个献计策”，“人人谈革新，处处搞革命”，形成了一个全面技术革新技术革命的全民运动，如哈尔滨亚麻厂，电机厂，量具刃具厂，长春第一汽车厂，沈阳电缆厂，重型机器厂，鞍钢等都是现代化大型企业，都大闹技术革新，技术革命，鞍钢由1月到2月15日，就有技术革新技术革命建议三十五万七千多件，已实现六万五千多件。长春第一汽车厂，技术革新技术革命运动只展开一个多月，创造出机械化点一千一百九十四项，自动化点一千三百九十六项，流水生产线一百三十七条，自动生产线一百六十条，自动联合机床二十八台。全厂已有三个工部、六个小组全部自动化。哈尔滨亚麻厂是个最新型设备厂，在技术革新技术革命运动中到2月10日，已创造成功的打麻梳理自动线、短麻梳理制条自动线，帆布剪毛自动线十六条，其他单机自动化和机械化等重大技术革新四十多项。其他厂矿企业都在大改大革，成绩都非常之大。这说明现代化大型企业能大革大改，而中、小型企业，大革大改，改的更为出色。
    不仅生产部门大闹技术革新技术革命，而非生产部门也大闹技术革新技术革命。如托儿所的阿姨们创造的小儿“报尿器”。还有最出色的哈尔滨“三八饭店”，送菜饭是自动线化，包饺子是联续化，由和面压皮包成饺子是一路线完成的，每一点钟能包一万二千个，炒菜洗具等自动化或机械化。还有一步登天的由手工操作一跃而自动线化，如长春秀丽售粮店创造的“电子自动控制计量仪”，售粮、售油不要量也不要秤，就可以完成任务。其他还多的很，举不胜举。在这个运动中，无论大、中、小企业，现代化的企业土的企业，都在大改大革，无论生产部门和非生产部门，都大闹技术革命技术革新，无论男的女的老的少的、有文化的、没文化的、有技术没有技术的，都有发明创造的机会，都有发明创造的园地。这是空前未有的大好形势。
    在创造和发明方面达到世界水平和尖端的产品那就多啦，仅就其精尖的说几项，如哈尔滨的“新技术试验楼”是四不要（不要砖、不要水泥、不要木料、不要钢筋）建成的。还有“攉煤机”、“无岩破碎机”等。由以上的事实看，技术革新技术革命的花朵真是“万紫千红”，并且越开越鲜艳。
    技术革新技术革命将开展时，春节放假工人群众自动退了火车票，不回家过节，要在自动线上吃饺子。废寝忘食的干，白天搞生产晚上搞革新，他们说越想越敢干，越干越敢想，越想越敢想，越干越敢干，越想越多、越干越大。这一股子干劲是什么力量推动着工人群众？工人群众说：“总路线产生自动线”。从这一句话里，就可以理解到党的总路线如此的深入人心，处处汹涌澎湃着大改大革的巨浪，处处放射着总路线的万丈光芒。
    在技术革新技术革命运动中，工人群众说：“外国人能干的我们就能干，外国人不能干的我们也能干”，“外国有的我们要有，外国没有的我们也要有”，“听党的话，万事都幸福，党给我梯子，我就敢上天”，这样革命英雄主义的雄心大志和革命自豪感，我受了鼓舞。
    工人群众对于技术革新技术革命有了“迷”，“三八饭店”的职工说：“我们干什么就想革什么，做什么就想创什么”。
    大连港在2月份消灭了顶，肩，扛，抬等笨重的体力劳动。沈阳等市基本上也消灭了笨重的体力劳动。工人群众说：“以前蹲着干，现在改为站着干，很快就可以改为坐着干”。工人群众认为技术革新技术革命是工人阶级的“第二次解放”，这样的声音是多么深刻、是多么感动人的。只有工人群众对于技术革新技术革命的意义才能了解的那样深刻，剥削阶级是不能够那样了解的。
    在这次参观中看见了广大劳动群众无穷的智慧、忘我的劳动、革命的英雄主义、共产主义风格、共产主义大协作，看见了他们的发明和创造，看见了他们的文化技术的大跃进，更看见他们对国家的贡献。新人新事不断出现，自己就觉得太渺小了。
    这次参观中听了二十多次的报告和记不清次数的介绍，都提到技术革新技术革命不是一帆风顺的，始终存在着保守与革命的斗争，先进与落后的斗争。技术革新技术革命运动，就是思想革命运动，就是思想改造过程，思想不解放，技术革新技术革命就开展不起来，或者开展起来也不能彻底。必须继续贯彻执行中共八届八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲，必须在党的领导下，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，才能解放思想，提高思想。我受到一次深刻的思想改造教育。
    技术革新技术革命运动的声势愈来愈大，“一处开花遍地结果”，“形势无限美好”。这个好形势，也是资产阶级知识分子改造的好形势。党千方百计的希望我们改造，在今天新形势之下，不能不加速改造，爬行会掉队的。有今天的好环境、好机会、好园地，我们应当举着毛泽东思想的红旗，高歌阔步前进！
