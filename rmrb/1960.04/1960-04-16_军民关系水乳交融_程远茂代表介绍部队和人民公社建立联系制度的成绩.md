Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully support all the reports of this conference. After listening to these reports, I feel infinitely joyous and encouraged. The reason why the people of our country have been able to achieve brilliant victories in continuous great leaps forward over the past year is that Mao Zedong Thought has blossomed and borne fruit on all fronts of the motherland, and it is the great victory of the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao. From these great victories, I have realized even more deeply that it is the greatest honor and happiness for our entire Party and the people of the whole country to have such a great and wise leader as Chairman Mao, leading the people of the whole country from victory to victory.
    The People's Commune is the ladder from socialism to communism. From the very beginning of the establishment of the People's Communes, the People's Liberation Army troops in our ×× area universally established contact with the local People's Communes. We have drawn tremendous strength from this contact, encouraging us to move forward. Now I will report this situation to the conference.
    Currently, the troops in our ×× area have established contact with twenty-three People's Communes, one hundred and four production brigades, and one hundred and ninety-six production teams respectively. Once the troops and the People's Communes establish contact, they comprehensively carry out mutual assistance and cooperation, mutual support, mutual learning, and mutual encouragement. The closer the contact, the more intimate the relationship, and the more energetic the cooperation. Therefore, the troops and the People's Communes have achieved a comprehensive great leap forward in political thought, production and construction, military training, organizing and training militia, cultural learning, technological innovation, and public welfare undertakings. Therefore, the establishment of contact between the troops and the People's Communes is of great benefit to the consolidation and development of the People's Communes and to the strengthening of army building.

    Great Leap Forward for Both the Military and the People
    First, in order to better help the consolidation and development of the People's Communes, the troops have used more than 1.75 million labor days in the past two years to help the People's Communes build 115 water conservancy projects. At the same time, they have provided technical support to the People's Communes, effectively helping the People's Communes to carry out technological innovation campaigns. The troops' repair shops and factories have successively helped the People's Communes establish 14 agricultural tool repair and assembly plants, fertilizer plants, and grain processing plants, repairing and assembling 4,377 pieces of machinery and processing parts, and manufacturing 1,260 sets of ball bearings. They have also adopted methods such as apprenticeship and training classes to train a large number of technical personnel for the People's Communes. As a result, they have vigorously supported the development of production in the People's Communes. Therefore, in the units with which they have contact, nine poor teams (brigades) have caught up with the rich teams. For example, a certain unit has successively supported the Shiban Brigade of the Tiepu Commune with more than 10,000 labor days, helping to deep plow the land, build reservoirs, solve the problem of irrigation self-flow, accumulate more than 20,000 dan of fertilizer, and transform low-yield fields into high-yield fields. They also mobilized cadres to donate and invest in jointly running "Military-Civilian Friendship High-Yield Experimental Fields." Although the late rice crop suffered from disasters last year, it still increased by 40%. Therefore, the Shiban Brigade shook off its label as a poor team and surpassed the rich teams. For example, after a certain unit established contact with the "Military-Civilian Brigade" of the Paoatai People's Commune, in addition to sending a large number of laborers to support the brigade's production, they also regularly sent working groups to live in the brigade, helping them formulate plans, arrange work, and improve work methods, thus enabling this team to change its backward appearance and leap to become an upstream team of the People's Commune. In addition, the troops have also universally dispatched management personnel and cooks to help the canteens establish management systems, improve cooking techniques, and study methods for saving grain and coal, making most of these canteens red banner canteens.
    Second, after the troops and the People's Communes established contact, all officers and soldiers further strengthened their mass concept, established the idea of "loving the commune as their home," and strengthened the relationship between the military and the people. In the past two years, the troops have donated funds and equipment, and donated books to help the People's Communes establish two agricultural middle schools, five primary schools, ninety-seven libraries and clubs, two hundred and ten kindergartens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly, and eighteen medical stations. They have treated more than 62,000 person-times for commune members. The health battalion of a certain unit overcame numerous difficulties and helped thirty-four People's Communes in two counties to open primary and intermediate medical personnel training classes, training 218 medical personnel. Through these activities, the relationship between the military and the people has become closer. The officers and soldiers regard the People's Communes as their own home, and the commune members regard the officers and soldiers as members of their own family. The soldiers said: "I have three homes—the company, my hometown, and the linked commune." The commune members call the company commander and instructor of the troops "our company commander and instructor." When the sideline production of some troops lags behind, the commune members, after learning about it, went out in groups at night, carrying lanterns, to help the troops dig fish ponds and accumulate fertilizer, and said: "Our production must strive to be upstream." When the troops go out for camping, the sideline production in the barracks is contracted by the People's Communes to manage and operate on their behalf. The ponds dug by the troops are used not only for raising fish, but also for irrigating the commune's fields. A folk song writes: "The people use water, the army raises fish, the fish and water are closely dependent on each other."
    Third, through contact, the troops can better help the commune organize and train militia. In the past two years, we have adopted methods such as assigning areas to be responsible for, sending people as instructors, transferring militia cadres to companies for internships, and joint military-civilian training to train backbone militia, many of whom have received various specialized training. The training results are all good or above. Through organizing and training the militia, the troops and the militia have established close ties. For example, a squad of a certain garrison island troop can name more than half of the militia in a nearby town. Whenever the militia sees comrades from the troops, they ask us to check their military studies or solve military problems.
    Fourth, through contact, the troops have gained a deeper understanding of the practice of social struggle, broadened the horizons of officers and soldiers, enriched their minds, and improved their policy level. Most of the 154 cadres from our units who were sent to the communes for training have written investigation reports, 34 of which have been selected as educational materials for educating the troops, with very good results. The vast number of officers and soldiers have personally seen the tremendous superiority and infinitely beautiful prospects displayed by the local People's Communes, and they can imagine the future of the People's Communes in their own hometowns. Therefore, in addition to resolutely supporting the People's Communes themselves, they also universally write letters home to encourage and educate their relatives to actively participate in and support the People's Communes.

    Various Ways of Contact
    We have various ways and methods of contacting the People's Communes. To sum up, there are the following types: First, the detachments are the unit, unified arrangements are made, and the method of "long-term presence, short-term rotation" is adopted to transfer cadres to the People's Communes in batches, each for one month. The tasks of the transferred cadres are to help, learn, and train. In the past two years, we have had 1,760 cadres transferred to the People's Communes; Second, leading cadres of the troops participate in the work of the People's Commune or production team Party committee (branch); Third, the troops are brought to the People's Communes and eat, live, work, and entertain with the commune members, using the People's Communes as classrooms, working and learning at the same time; Fourth, joint organization or mutual dispatch of representatives to participate in activities such as activist conferences, Communist Youth League representative conferences, celebration, merit, oath-taking, harvest celebration, and festival celebrations; Fifth, the troops and the People's Communes mutually invite cadres or hero and model figures to give reports, introducing advanced deeds and advanced experiences; Sixth, the troops and the linked communes (teams) carry out socialist competitions, comparing thoughts, comparing energy, comparing style, and comparing achievements, sharing good news and celebrating achievements with each other. In addition, there is frequent and informal mutual exchange, mutual support, and joint leap forward between the troops and the People's Communes.
    In our troops' contact with the People's Communes, most units have achieved comprehensive cooperation, close contact, mutual supervision, and joint leap forward. However, there are also a few units whose contact with the People's Communes is not frequent enough, the cooperation is not comprehensive enough, and the role is not obvious enough. Therefore, the troops in our ×× area must, in accordance with the spirit of this conference, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, muster up their energy, strive for the upstream, continue the Great Leap Forward, and continue to adhere to the form of contact between the troops and the People's Communes as a system. Let the troops and the People's Communes better cooperate, carry out socialist competitions, encourage each other, make a double leap forward, and strive to comprehensively complete the glorious tasks in the future. We are located on the front line of coastal defense. All the members of our linked communes are constantly watching the war preparations of American imperialism, raising our vigilance, and waging unremitting struggles to defend peace and defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

    军民关系水乳交融
    程远茂代表介绍部队和人民公社建立联系制度的成绩主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护这次大会的各项报告。听了这些报告，使我感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。一年来，我国人民之所以能取得连续大跃进的光辉胜利，这是毛泽东思想在祖国各个战线上的开花结果，是党和毛主席制定的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的伟大胜利。从这些伟大胜利中，使我更加体会到：我们能有毛主席这样伟大的英明的领袖，领导着全国人民从胜利走向胜利，是我们全党和全国人民最大的光荣和幸福。
    人民公社是从社会主义过渡到共产主义的天梯。从人民公社一建立，我们××地区的解放军部队，就普遍地与驻地人民公社建立了联系，从联系中吸取了巨大的力量，鼓舞着我们前进。现在我把这个情况向大会汇报一下。
    目前我们××地区的各部队分别和二十三个人民公社，一百零四个生产大队，一百九十六个生产队建立了联系。部队与人民公社一建立联系，就全面地开展了互助协作、互相支援、互相学习、互相鼓励，越联系越亲密，越协作越有劲。因而部队、人民公社在政治思想、生产建设、军事训练、组训民兵、文化学习、技术革新、公共福利事业等方面，都实现了全面大跃进。所以，部队与人民公社建立了联系，无论对人民公社的巩固和发展，对加强军队建设，都大有好处。
    军民双双大跃进
    第一、部队为了更好地帮助人民公社的巩固和发展，两年来，用一百七十五万多个劳动日，帮助人民公社建设水利工程一百一十五项，同时还对人民公社进行了技术支援，有力地帮助人民公社开展了技术革新运动。部队修械所、工厂曾先后帮助人民公社建立了农具修配厂、肥料厂、粮食加工厂等十四个，修配机械、加工零件四千三百七十七件，制作滚珠轴承一千二百六十套。并且采用带徒弟、开训练班的办法，为人民公社培养了大批的技术人员。这样做的结果，有力地支援了人民公社的生产发展，因此，在联系的单位中，有九个穷队（大队）赶上了富队。如某部先后支援铁铺公社石板大队一万多个劳动日，帮助深翻土地，修建水库，解决了灌溉自流化，积肥二万多担，改造低产田为丰产田，并且发动干部捐献、投资，合办“军民友谊高产试验田”，去年晚造虽然受灾，但仍然增产四成。因此，石板大队摘掉了穷队帽子，超过了富队。如某部与炮台人民公社“军民大队”建立了联系后，除了派大批劳动力支援大队生产外，还经常派有工作组住在大队，帮助他们制定规划，安排工作，改进工作方法，因而使这个队改变了落后的面貌，一跃而为人民公社的上游队。另外，部队还普遍地派出了管理人员和炊事员，帮助食堂建立管理制度，改善烹调技术，研究节约粮、煤方法，使这些食堂大部分成为红旗食堂。
    第二、部队与人民公社建立联系后，全体官兵进一步加强了群众观念，树立了“爱社如家”的思想，密切了军民关系。两年来，由部队捐献经费，赠送器材、图书，帮助人民公社建立了农业中学两所、小学五所，图书馆、俱乐部九十七所，幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院二百一十个，医疗站十八所。为社员治病六万二千多人次。某部卫生营克服了重重困难，帮助两个县的三十四个人民公社，开办了初级和中级医务人员训练班，培养医务人员二百一十八名。通过这些活动，军民关系更加密切了，官兵把人民公社当作自己的家，社员把官兵看作是自己家里的人。战士们说：“我有三个家——连队、家乡和联系社”。社员把部队的连长、指导员称为“我们的连长、指导员”。有的部队副业生产落后了，社员们知道以后，连夜成群结队，提着灯笼，帮助部队挖鱼塘、积肥料，并且说：“我们的生产一定要争上游”。部队外出野营时，营房里的副业生产，就由人民公社包下来，代为经营管理。部队挖的水塘除养鱼外，还供公社灌田，有首民歌写道：“民用水、军养鱼、鱼水紧相依”。
    第三、通过联系，部队可以更好地帮助公社组训民兵。两年来，我们采取分片包干、派人当教员、抽调民兵干部到连队实习、军民合练等办法，训练了基干民兵，其中有不少人受过各种特业训练。训练成绩都在良好以上。通过组训民兵，部队和民兵建立了密切的联系。如某守岛部队的一个班，他们把附近一个镇上的民兵的名字能叫出一半以上。民兵一见到部队同志，就要我们检查他们的军事学习，或解决军事上的疑难问题。
    第四、通过联系，部队更深入地了解社会斗争的实践，开阔了官兵的眼界，丰富了头脑，提高了政策水平。我们几个单位的一百五十四名下放公社锻炼的干部，大部分都写了考察报告，其中有三十四篇被选为教育材料，对部队进行教育，效果很好。广大官兵亲眼看到了当地人民公社显示出来的巨大优越性和无限美好的远景，都会想像到了自己家乡人民公社的前途，因此，除他们自己坚决拥护人民公社外，还普遍地写信回家，鼓励和教育自己的亲属，积极参加和拥护人民公社。
    联系方式多种多样
    我们和人民公社联系的方式方法是多种多样的，归纳起来，有如下几种：一、以支队为单位，统一安排，采取“长期有人，短期轮换”的方法，分批抽调干部下放到人民公社，每期一个月。下放干部的任务是一帮、二学、三锻炼。两年来，我们有一千七百六十名干部下放到人民公社；二、部队领导干部参加人民公社或生产队党委（支部）工作；三、把部队带到人民公社，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同娱乐，以人民公社为课堂，边劳动、边学习；四、联合组织或互派代表参加积极分子大会、共青团代表会、祝捷、庆功、誓师、庆丰收、节日庆祝等活动；五、部队与人民公社互相邀请干部或英雄模范人物作报告，介绍先进事迹和先进经验；六、部队和联系社（队），开展社会主义竞赛，比思想、比干劲、比风格、比成绩，有喜互相报喜，有功互相庆贺。此外，部队与人民公社之间，还采取经常的、不拘形式的互相来往，互相支援，共同跃进。
    我们部队和人民公社联系，极大部分单位作到了全面协作、密切联系、互相督促、共同跃进。但也有少数单位与人民公社的联系不够经常，协作不够全面，作用不太明显。因此，我们××地区的部队，一定要根据这次大会的精神，高举毛泽东思想红旗，鼓足干劲，力争上游，继续大跃进，把部队和人民公社联系的形式，作为一种制度继续坚持下去。使部队和人民公社更好地协作，开展社会主义竞赛，互相鼓励，双双大跃进，为全面地完成今后的光荣任务而奋斗。我们处在海防前线，我们和联系社的全体社员都时刻注视着美帝国主义备战活动，提高警惕，为保卫和平，保卫祖国社会主义建设，进行坚持不懈的斗争。
