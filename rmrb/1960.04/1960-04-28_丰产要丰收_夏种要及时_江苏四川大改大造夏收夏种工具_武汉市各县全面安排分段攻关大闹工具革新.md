    Jiangsu and Sichuan Vigorously Modify and Manufacture Tools for Summer Harvesting and Planting
    Wuhan Municipal Counties Comprehensively Arrange Phased Campaigns to Revolutionize Tools
    Xinhua News Agency reports: Under the slogan "When the farming season arrives, tools must come first," Jiangsu Province is preparing for summer harvesting and planting agricultural tools more than a month earlier than in previous years. As of early April, the province has manufactured more than 18 million pieces of various summer harvesting and planting agricultural tools, including plows, harrows, threshing machines, harvesters, transportation equipment, and seeders, more than double the number in the same period last year. Most of the agricultural tools needed for summer harvesting and planting are ready.
    This year's summer harvesting and planting agricultural tools have a higher proportion of semi-mechanized and improved agricultural tools, and the quality has also been greatly improved compared to last year. For example, the number of transportation vehicles has tripled compared to last year, with rubber-wheeled vehicles accounting for 50%. Most counties in the Xuzhou Special District have achieved one vehicle per household. Wujiang County in the Suzhou Special District also adapted old boats and old rice beds to manufacture more than 30,000 mud-dredging boats, greatly improving efficiency compared to manual mud carrying. There have also been significant improvements in tillage and harrowing tools compared to last year. Many counties in the Yangzhou and Yancheng Special Districts have promoted single-wheeled and double-wheeled disc plows, with one plow capable of plowing more than ten mu of paddy fields per day, increasing efficiency by three to four times. In addition to small sickles, which are available to everyone, more than 16,000 animal-powered harvesters and rapid harvesters have been promoted according to local conditions. This year, more than 30% of the province's wheat fields will be harvested using semi-mechanized and improved agricultural tools. In addition, various regions in the province have also prepared many rice and wheat dual-purpose threshing machines and improved stone rollers for threshing.
    In the early preparation of summer harvesting and planting agricultural tools in Jiangsu Province, Party committees at all levels have conscientiously implemented the policy of industry supporting agriculture and strengthened the leadership of agricultural tool production. As early as around the Spring Festival, employees of various agricultural tool factories widely carried out activities to support agriculture with industry, and fully developed the communist spirit of "rather have ourselves be troubled a thousand times than let the peasants feel even a slight inconvenience," achieving "early start, good quality, and heartfelt service." On the basis of completing spring plowing agricultural tools more than forty days ahead of schedule, they vigorously manufactured summer harvesting and planting agricultural tools. At the same time, various regions have also drawn a large number of personnel to establish mobile repair teams, going deep into the small teams to process and repair agricultural tools for them.
    In the manufacturing and promotion of semi-mechanized improved agricultural tools, various regions have adhered to the principle of relying mainly on local resources, combining indigenous and foreign methods, with remarkable results. For example, in promoting rice transplanters, in addition to timely arranging agricultural machinery factories to produce a batch of South "105" type rice transplanters with high technical requirements, they also mobilized the masses to vigorously develop simple rice transplanters and promote simple models such as Hunan Liling No. 2 and South Agricultural No. 2. This year, the province will have 150,000 simple rice transplanters put into rice transplanting, accounting for more than 30% of the total rice area. Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and the suburbs of Nanjing strive to use rice transplanters for 70% of the rice.

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Sichuan Province is comprehensively preparing for the summer harvest with tool reform as the center, to ensure a bumper harvest of spring crops and that every grain is stored. Preliminary statistics show that the province has created and improved more than 370 types of summer harvesting tools. After on-site operation, these tools generally improve efficiency by several to dozens of times compared to sickle harvesting and manual threshing. Nanchong, Mianyang, Wenjiang, Daxian, Fuling and other special districts have promoted more than one million pieces of improved summer harvesting tools. After these special districts extensively use improved tools, the summer harvest time will be greatly shortened compared to last year.
    This year, Sichuan has a large area of summer harvest crops, good seedlings, and an early and concentrated maturity period. The harvesting volume is larger than in previous years. At the same time, the summer harvest period is also the busy season for planting mid-season rice, and the labor force is very tight. Various regions have seized the important link of reforming tools to solve the problem of labor shortage. As early as a month ago, various regions investigated the situation of summer harvesting tools, and organized agricultural tool factories at all levels to arrange time to manufacture and repair summer harvesting tools as needed. New tools created and improved by the masses in various regions are also promptly organized for on-site meetings for evaluation and appraisal, and those that are usable are immediately vigorously promoted. More than 940 hydropower stations in the Wenjiang Special District have installed threshing equipment, and 70% of the wheat can be threshed by hydropower. Since the beginning of April, the Yibin, Fuling, and Daxian Special Districts have organized forces to build threshing grounds on a large scale. Currently, more than 30,000 threshing grounds are being built or have been completed.
    While actively promoting and creating new tools and semi-mechanized tools, various regions have also tried their best to use all existing tools, so that each can display its power and make the most of everything. The Fuling Special District has organized material resources from the following seven aspects to accelerate the threshing work: all of the existing more than 20,000 threshing machines are powered by animals for threshing; more than 14,000 threshing grounds are renovated and fully utilized; tractors are used to drive long-tube threshing machines. After testing, one tractor can thresh 30,000 jin of wheat per day; more than 100 water pumps are comprehensively utilized; the grain stations' more than 1,000 drying grounds are all used for threshing; mixing barrels are used for simultaneous harvesting and threshing; and old foot-operated threshing machines are used. It is preliminarily estimated that with these seven methods being used simultaneously, the timely threshing and storage of wheat in the entire special district will be guaranteed.

    Xinhua News Agency reports: The counties of Wuhan are vigorously manufacturing and modifying harvesting, threshing, and water-lifting equipment, preparing sharp tools for the summer harvest and planting.
    The agricultural tool factories of the counties and communes in Wuhan, as well as the management areas and production teams of the people's communes, have implemented the policy of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, relying mainly on indigenous methods, and progressing from indigenous to foreign methods. They have adopted the method of comprehensive arrangement and phased campaigns to vigorously carry out tool reform, creating the experience of one animal driving multiple mills in the previous stage, and more widely utilizing water power, wind power, and a series of reformed tools from cultivation to cooking. In order to continue to boost their efforts and vigorously grasp the processing tool reform to meet the needs of summer planting and harvesting, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site tool reform meeting in Yunmeng and Hanyang counties, emphasizing that all regions should fight hard in April and May, focusing on grasping rice and flour processing tools, eliminating hand-pushed mills, and promoting small steel mills, vertical three-fan mills, and one animal driving multiple mills, wind-powered flour milling tools, etc. In terms of threshing, it is required to eliminate beating the grain with flails. For water-lifting equipment, it is required to quickly complete the matching, installation, and construction of stations. (Attached picture)

    丰产要丰收  夏种要及时
    江苏四川大改大造夏收夏种工具
    武汉市各县全面安排分段攻关大闹工具革新
    据新华社讯　江苏省各地在“农时来到、农具先行”的口号下，比往年提前一个多月做好夏收夏种农具准备。全省到4月上旬止，已制成犁、耙、脱粒、收割、运输、播种等各种夏收夏种农具一千八百多万件，比去年同期增加了一倍以上。夏收、夏种所需要的农具大部分已准备停当。
    今年夏收夏种农具中，半机械化农具和改良农具的比重增加，在质量上也比去年大大提高，如仅运输车子一项，比去年增加三倍，其中胶轮车就占有50％。徐州专区大部分县已做到每户有一辆车子。苏州专区吴江县还因地制宜利用旧船、旧稻床等改制了三万多部拖泥船，比人工挑泥的工效大大提高。在耕耙工具方面，也比去年大有改进。扬州和盐城专区不少县推广了单轮和双轮圆盘犁，一部犁一天可耕水田十亩以上，提高工效三、四倍。收割工具除小镰刀做到人手一把外，并因地制宜的推广了畜力收割机和快速收割器等一万六千多部，今年全省将有30％以上的麦田使用半机械化农具和改良农具收割。另外，全省各地还准备了许多脱粒使用的稻麦二用脱粒机和改良石磙等工具。
    江苏省在提前做好夏收夏种农具的准备工作中，各级党委都认真贯彻了工业支援农业的方针，加强了农具生产的领导。早在春节前后，各农具厂职工就广泛开展了工业支援农业的活动，并充分发扬了“宁可自己麻烦千遍、不让农民稍感不便”的共产主义风格，做到了“早字当头、好字连心”，在提前四十多天完成春耕农具基础上，大造夏收夏种农具。同时，各地还抽出大批力量，成立流动修配组，深入小队，为他们加工和修配农具。
    在制造和推广半机械化改良农具中，各地坚持了以土为主，土洋并举的方针，效果显著。如推广插秧机，除及时安排农业机械厂生产一批技术要求较高的南“一零五”型插秧机外，同时发动群众大搞简易插秧机，并推广湖南醴陵二号和南农二号等简易型号插秧机。全省今年将有十五万部简易插秧机投入水稻栽插，约占水稻总面积30％以上，徐州、淮阴和南京郊区，争取70％的水稻使用插秧机栽插。
    据新华社讯　四川省以工具改革为中心全面进行夏收准备，确保小春作物丰产丰收，粒粒归仓。初步统计，全省已创造和改良夏收工具三百七十多种，经过实地操作，这些工具一般比镰刀收割和手工脱粒提高工效几倍到几十倍。南充、绵阳、温江、达县、涪陵等专区已推广夏收改良工具一百多万件，这些专区大量使用改良工具后，夏收时间将比去年大大缩短。
    今年四川各地夏收作物面积大、苗架好、成熟期早而集中，收割量比历年都大，同时夏收期间又正是中稻栽插的大忙时节，劳动力十分紧张。各地都抓住改革工具这一重要环节，来解决劳力不足的问题。早在一个月前，各地就调查了夏收工具的情况，并组织各级农具厂按需要安排时间制造、修配夏收工具。对各地群众创造和改良的新工具，也及时组织现场会评选鉴定，可用的立即大力推广。温江专区九百四十多处水力站都已安装脱粒设备，70％的小麦可用水力脱粒。宜宾、涪陵、达县三个专区，从4月初开始就组织力量大建场坝，目前正在修建和已建成的场坝达三万多处。
    各地一方面积极推广、创造新工具和半机械化工具，一方面又尽可能把一切旧有的工具都利用起来，做到各显其力，物尽其用。涪陵专区已从以下七个方面组织物力，以加快脱粒工作：现有的二万多部打谷机，全部用畜力带动来脱粒；一万四千多处场坝加以整修，全部使用起来；用拖拉机带动长筒打谷机，经试验，一台拖拉机每天可脱粒小麦三万斤；一百多台抽水机全部综合利用；粮站的一千多处晒场全部用来打场；利用拌桶，边收边打；使用旧有的足踏连架脱粒。初步估计，这七种办法同时并用，全专区小麦及时脱粒入仓就有了保证。
    据新华社讯　武汉市各县大造大改收割、脱粒和提水机具，为夏收夏种准备利器。
    武汉各县、社农具厂和人民公社管理区、生产队，都贯彻自力更生、土洋并举、以土为主、由土到洋的方针，采取全面安排、分段攻关的办法大闹工具改革，在前一阶段创造了一畜带多磨，更广泛地利用水力、风力以及从耕作到炊事工具一系列改革工具的经验。为了继续鼓足干劲，大抓加工工具改革，以满足夏种夏收的需要，中共武汉市委最近在云梦、汉阳县召开了工具改革现场会，强调各地要大战4、5月，突击抓好米面加工工具，消灭手推磨，推广小钢磨、立式三扇磨和一畜多磨、风力带动的磨面工具等；在脱粒方面，要求消灭连杖打场；对于提水机具，要求迅速作好配套、安装、建站工作。（附图片）
