Work Together to Maintain and Develop Sino-Indian Friendship

As long as we consider the long-term interests of friendship between the two countries in everything we do, take into account both the historical background and the current practical situation, and adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, the boundary issue between the two countries can be completely, fairly, reasonably, and comprehensively resolved.

Speech by Premier Zhou Enlai at the banquet hosted by Prime Minister Nehru

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 20th – Premier Zhou Enlai's full speech at the banquet hosted by Indian Prime Minister Nehru today:

Your Excellency Respected Prime Minister Nehru, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to attend the banquet hosted by Your Excellency Prime Minister Nehru for us today. On behalf of myself and Vice Premier Chen Yi, I would like to express my gratitude to Your Excellency Prime Minister Nehru, and extend my greetings to all Indian friends and foreign envoys present.

Nearly three and a half years have passed since my last visit to your great country. During this period, the world has undergone further tremendous changes conducive to world peace and human progress, and our two countries have also made considerable achievements in building our respective nations. In the past year or so, although some twists and turns have occurred in our relations due to temporary differences of opinion on the boundary issue between our two countries and some unfortunate accidental events, this should not and cannot shake the foundation of long-term friendship between our two peoples. Our two peoples have a history of friendly exchanges spanning thousands of years, and this long-standing traditional friendship has been further developed on a new basis since our two countries gained independence. In order to build our respective countries and safeguard peace in Asia and the world, we need to continue to strengthen our friendly cooperation. I firmly believe that the profound friendship between our two peoples is unshakable.

For our two peoples, nothing is more important than our respective construction endeavors. Although our two countries have different social systems and different paths of development, the poverty and backwardness caused by colonialism to our two countries are equally serious, and the construction tasks facing our two countries are equally arduous. Therefore, it is only natural for the two peoples to care for and learn from each other while carrying out their respective constructions. The economic construction exhibition held by India in our country in 1956 aroused great interest among our people, and this year's agricultural exhibition in Delhi, China, has also received attention from the Indian people. The Chinese people have had the honor of receiving many Indian professional delegations, and Chinese delegations of the same nature have also visited India to learn. It must be admitted that in the past, our two countries did not do enough in exchanging construction experiences. In the future, with the further development of our two countries' construction, it will be necessary to particularly strengthen this important link in the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

The Chinese people are devoting all their energy to increasing production, improving their lives, and rapidly building their country into a truly prosperous and strong nation. In the past ten years or so, the Chinese people have made some achievements in these areas. However, these achievements are still extremely limited compared to the major tasks that need to be completed in the future. The Chinese people are fully aware that to completely get rid of backwardness, they must make decades of arduous efforts. The Chinese people are not only determined to build their own country well, but also sincerely hope that our friendly neighbor India and other Asian and African countries can also quickly prosper and become strong. The people of Asian and African countries are all diligent and intelligent, and have a strong desire to get rid of poverty and backwardness. This most favorable condition, coupled with our abundant resources, makes it entirely possible for us to overcome all difficulties in construction and develop our industrial and agricultural production. We Asian and African countries should have such confidence: what Western countries can do, we can certainly do, and we will definitely do it better than them. The deep disaster of colonial rule once united us, and the glorious task of construction should unite us even more closely.

In order to concentrate on domestic construction, we both urgently need a long-term international environment of peace. Our two countries have made unremitting efforts in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. We jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and we cooperated well at the historically significant Bandung Conference. We are pleased to see that on the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, the movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism, against racial discrimination, and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence have achieved continuous victories. The Chinese government and people abide by the Five Principles, are loyal to the Bandung Spirit, and have consistently supported the struggles of the Asian and African peoples and safeguarded the unity of Asian and African countries; China's position is unwavering. Some people disapprove of this, and we don't mind. We believe that as long as they are not malicious, after a period of observation, they will understand.

As far as the current world situation is concerned, the prospects for striving for peace are brighter than at any time in the past. Like India, China also hopes that the conferences on disarmament and the upcoming East-West summit will lead to further relaxation of the international situation. However, some powerful groups in the world are still expanding their armaments, strengthening aggressive military alliances, expanding overseas military bases, and trying to poison the international atmosphere and obstruct the East and West from reaching agreements on some major international issues. It is particularly noteworthy that, with the support of these groups, militarist and fascist forces that once launched world wars are being revived, once again threatening world peace and security. All of this shows that maintaining world peace is still an arduous task. Under these circumstances, it is necessary for our two countries, China and India, to strengthen our friendly cooperation so as to work together with peace-loving countries and peoples around the world to make significant contributions to world peace and human progress.

As for the boundary issue between our two countries, in our opinion, this issue is only a local and temporary issue compared to the fundamental issue of maintaining friendly cooperation between the two countries. In common Chinese parlance, it is a matter of one finger versus nine fingers. Of course, we acknowledge that resolving the Sino-Indian boundary issue has its difficulties, because this issue is an extremely complex issue left to our two countries by colonialism; but on the other hand, we also have favorable conditions for resolving this issue, because our two countries are both independent, we both have a desire for friendly cooperation, and we can no longer be bound by outdated concepts. The Chinese government and I myself firmly believe that as long as we consider the long-term interests of friendship between the two countries in everything we do, take into account both the historical background and the current practical situation, and adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, the boundary issue between the two countries can be completely, fairly, reasonably, and comprehensively resolved. The Sino-Indian boundary issue is a legacy of history, not created by our two governments. The Chinese government especially does not want to see the boundary issue between the two countries affect relations between the two countries. In order to seek various ways to peacefully resolve the boundary issue, the Chinese government has never hesitated to make the greatest efforts it can make. I sincerely hope that this meeting between the Prime Ministers of the two countries will produce positive and beneficial results.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Nehru said it well: Friendship is not only necessary for our two countries, but also for peace in Asia and the world. I believe that our joint efforts will surely enable the friendship between our two countries to be maintained and developed. I once again thank Your Excellency Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government for the invitation and hospitality, and sincerely wish the Indian people greater and greater achievements in the great cause of building their country and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. I propose a toast:

To the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples,
To the prosperity and strength of India,
To peace in Asia and the world,
To the health of Your Excellency Prime Minister Nehru,
Cheers!

### 共同努力维护和发展中印友谊

    共同努力维护和发展中印友谊
    只要处处为两国友好的长远利益着想，既考虑到历史背景，又考虑到当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，互谅互让，两国边界问题是完全能够公平合理的全面解决的
    周恩来总理在尼赫鲁总理举行的宴会上的讲话
    新华社新德里20日电　周恩来总理今天在印度总理尼赫鲁举行的宴会上的讲话全文：尊敬的尼赫鲁总理阁下，女士们，先生们：
    今天我有机会参加尼赫鲁总理阁下为我们举行的宴会，感到十分荣幸。我以我个人和陈毅副总理的名义，向尼赫鲁总理阁下表示感谢，并且向在座的各位印度朋友和各国使节们致意。
    自从上次我访问你们伟大的国家以来，将近三年半的时间过去了。在这个期间，世界上发生了进一步有利于世界和平和人类进步的巨大变化，我们两国在各自建设自己的国家方面也取得了不少成就。最近一年多来，尽管由于对两国边界问题的暂时性的意见分歧和某些不幸的意外事件，我们两国的关系发生了一些波折，但是这不应该、也不可能动摇我们两国人民长期友好的基础。我们两国人民有几千年友好来往的历史，在我们两国各自取得独立以后，这种悠久的传统友谊又在新的基础上得到了进一步的发展。为了建设我们各自的国家，为了维护亚洲和世界和平，我们需要继续加强彼此之间的友好合作，我深信，我们两国人民之间的深厚友谊是不可动摇的。
    对于我们两国人民来说，没有任何事情比各自的建设事业更加重要。尽管我们两国的社会制度不同，建设的道路也不一样，但是，殖民主义给我们两国所造成的贫穷和落后同样严重，我们两国所面临的建设任务也同样艰巨。因此，两国人民在各自进行建设的同时，互相关心，互相学习，是非常自然的。1956年印度在我国举办的经济建设展览会引起了我国人民的很大兴趣，今年我国在德里的农业展览也受到了印度人民的重视。中国人民曾经荣幸地接待过不少印度的专业代表团，同样性质的中国代表团也曾经到印度来访问和学习。应该承认，过去我们两国在交流建设经验方面还做得不够。今后，随着我们两国建设的进一步发展，有必要格外加强两国友好合作关系中的这一个重要的环节。
    中国人民把全副精力用于提高生产，改善生活，和迅速地把自己的国家建设成为一个真正繁荣富强的国家。过去十多年来，中国人民在这些方面取得了一些成就。但是，这些成就同今后须要完成的重大任务相比，还是极其有限的。中国人民充分地认识到，要彻底摆脱落后，还必须作几十年的艰苦努力。中国人民不仅决心把自己的国家建设好，而且真诚地希望我们的友好邻邦印度和其他亚非国家也能够很快地繁荣富强起来。亚非国家的人民都是勤劳智慧的，都有摆脱贫穷落后的强烈愿望。这个最有利的条件，加上我们的丰富资源，使我们完全有可能克服建设中的一切困难，发展我们的工农业生产。我们亚非国家应该有这样一个信心：西方国家能够做到的，我们也一定能够做到，而且一定会比它们做得更好。殖民统治的深重灾难曾经使我们团结在一起，光荣的建设任务应该使我们更加紧密地团结起来。
    为了专心致志于国内建设，我们都迫切需要一个长期的国际和平环境。在维护亚洲和世界和平事业中，我们两国作了不懈的努力。我们共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，并且在具有历史意义的万隆会议上作过良好的合作。我们高兴地看到，在万隆会议五周年纪念的时候，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反对殖民主义、反对种族歧视、争取和维护民族独立的运动取得了连续不断的胜利。中国政府和人民信守五项原则，忠于万隆精神，一贯支持亚非人民的斗争，维护亚非国家的团结；中国的这个立场是坚定不移的。有些人不以为然，我们也不介意。我们相信，只要他们不怀恶意，经过一个时期的观察，他们是会明白过来的。
    就目前的世界形势说，争取和平的前景比过去任何时期都要更加光明。和印度一样，中国也希望有关裁军的会议和不久即将召开的东西方首脑会议能够导致国际局势的进一步和缓。但是，世界上一些有势力的集团还在扩军备战，加强侵略性的军事同盟，扩大海外军事基地，力图毒化国际气氛，阻挠东西方就一些重大国际问题达成协议。特别值得注意的是，在这些集团的扶植下，曾经发动过世界大战的军国主义和法西斯势力正在复活，重新威胁世界的和平和安全。所有这些都说明维护世界和平仍然是一个艰巨的任务。在这种情况下，我们中印两国有必要加强我们的友好合作，以便同世界上爱好和平的国家和人民一道，为世界和平和人类进步作出重大的贡献。
    至于我们两国之间的边界问题，在我们看来，这个问题比之于维护两国友好合作的根本问题，仅仅是一个局部的暂时的问题。用中国通俗的语言来说，是一个指头和九个指头的问题。当然，我们承认，解决中印边界问题有它的困难之处，因为这个问题是殖民主义给我们两国遗留下来的极其复杂的问题；但是，另一方面我们也有解决这个问题的有利条件，因为我们两国都独立了，我们都具有友好合作的愿望，我们可以不再为陈旧的观念所束缚。中国政府和我本人深信，只要处处为两国友好的长远利益着想，既考虑到历史背景，又考虑到当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，互谅互让，两国边界问题是完全能够求得公平合理的全面解决的。中印边界问题是历史上遗留下来的，不是我们两国政府制造出来的。中国政府尤其不愿意看到两国边界问题影响到两国关系。为了寻求和平解决边界问题的各种途径，中国政府从不吝惜作出自己可能作出的最大努力。我衷心地希望两国总理这次的会晤能够产生积极的和有益的效果。
    尼赫鲁总理阁下说得好：友谊不仅对于我们两国是必要的，对于亚洲和世界和平也是必要的。我相信，我们的共同努力，一定能够使我们两国的友谊得到维护和发展。我再一次感谢尼赫鲁总理阁下和印度政府的邀请和款待，并且衷心地祝印度人民在建设自己的国家和维护亚洲和世界和平的伟大事业中获得更多更大的成就。我提议：
    为中印两国人民的传统友谊，
    为印度的繁荣和富强，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为尼赫鲁总理阁下的健康，
    干杯！
