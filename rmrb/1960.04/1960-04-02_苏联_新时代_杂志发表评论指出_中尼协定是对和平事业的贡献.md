Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st. The "New Times" magazine of the Soviet Union published a commentary on the results of the Sino-Nepalese talks, saying that following the recent Sino-Burmese agreement on the boundary issue, China and Nepal have reached an agreement on the same issue. This shows that as long as both sides are sincere, extremely complex boundary issues can be resolved smoothly.
    The commentary said that the Sino-Nepalese economic assistance agreement is also of great significance. China does not seek any privileges in Nepal, and it does not impose any political conditions on Nepal.
    The commentary also stated that the Sino-Nepalese agreement proves that these two neighboring countries are further developing their friendly relations smoothly on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This agreement is based on the policy of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality between large and small countries pursued by socialist countries.
    The commentary pointed out that, judging from some reactions in the Western press, those who want to profit from disputes between countries with different systems do not like the successful conclusion of the Sino-Nepalese talks. And those who are concerned about strengthening friendship between countries and easing international tensions welcome the Sino-Nepalese agreement and regard it as another contribution to the cause of peace.

    苏联“新时代”杂志发表评论指出
    中尼协定是对和平事业的贡献
    新华社莫斯科31日电　“新时代”杂志就中国和尼泊尔会谈结果发表评论说，继不久前签订的中缅关于边界问题协定之后，中尼两国又在同样的问题上达成了协议，这说明，只要双方有诚意，极其复杂的边界问题也是可以顺利解决的。
    评论说，中尼两国经济援助协定也有重大意义。中国不在尼泊尔寻求任何特权，它不向尼泊尔提出任何政治条件。
    评论又说，中尼协定证明了，这两个邻国在和平共处五项原则的基础上进一步顺利发展两国的友好关系。这个协定是以社会主义国家所奉行的互相尊重主权、大小国家一律平等的政策为出发点的。
    评论指出，从西方报纸的某些反应看来，那些想利用制度不同的国家之间的纠纷从中渔利的人不喜欢中尼会谈圆满成功。而那些关心加强各国之间的友谊和缓和国际紧张局势的人们欢迎中尼协定，认为它是对和平事业的又一贡献。
