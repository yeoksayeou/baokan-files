Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th: The Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge has been fully completed. Test results show that the construction quality of the bridge has met all design requirements and has been rated as excellent overall. Currently, the main line track connection work is underway on both sides of the bridgehead. The bridge will soon be handed over to the state for use.

The Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge began construction on May 14, 1958, and has completed all construction tasks in less than two years, six months ahead of the original national plan. This bridge is a double-track railway bridge, nearly three kilometers long, with a total of seventy-two piers. The entire project was designed and built by our own country. After it is completed and opened to traffic, it will greatly improve the transportation capacity of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 18th: The construction project of Baotou Steel's No. 1 giant open-hearth furnace and related auxiliary projects have comprehensively entered the final stage. The installation and bricklaying of steel structures, refractory materials, and various mechanical equipment for the main body of Baotou Steel's No. 1 open-hearth furnace have been completed, except for a portion of the refractory bricks in the melting chamber that can only be laid before furnace baking according to construction requirements. The overall construction project of the steelmaking area, centered on this large open-hearth furnace, including the ingot mold, ingot casting, mixer furnace, bulk raw materials, and cooling workshops, has also been completed by 94% according to the steel tapping requirements of No. 1 open-hearth furnace. Currently, the railway has been connected to the main plant building, ingot mold, and raw material area where the open-hearth furnace is located. The mixer furnace of the material supply system, as well as the 350-ton large overhead crane in the main plant building for transporting molten iron and molten steel ladles, have all been installed. The power supply heart of No. 1 open-hearth furnace – No. 4 substation – and the No. 5 water pumping station of the water supply system have been successfully test-run. Two large gas pipes from the blast furnace and coke oven have also extended to the side of the open-hearth furnace. All of this indicates that the day for baking the furnace and tapping steel from Baotou Steel's No. 1 open-hearth furnace is getting closer and closer. (Attached picture)

    郑州黄河大桥全部建成
    包钢一号平炉建设工程即将完工
    据新华社郑州18日电　郑州黄河大桥已经全部建成。试验结果表明，大桥建设工程质量达到了各项设计要求，总评为质量优良。目前，正在进行桥头两岸的正线接轨工程。不久，大桥即将交付国家使用。
    郑州黄河大桥，是1958年5月14日动工兴建的，至今不到两年的时间就完成了全部建设任务，比国家原订计划提前半年建成。这座大桥为双线铁路桥，全长将近三公里，共有七十二个桥墩，全部工程都是我国自己设计建筑的。它建成通车后，将大大提高京广铁路的运输能力。
    据新华社包头18日电　包钢一号巨型平炉建设工程及有关的各项附属工程，已经全面进入结尾阶段。包钢一号平炉本体的钢铁结构、耐火材料和各种机械设备的安装砌筑工程，除开熔炼室的一部分耐火砖按照施工要求只能在烘炉前进行砌筑以外，其他都已完成了。以这座大平炉为中心，包括整模、铸锭、混铁炉、散装原料、冷却等车间的炼钢区整体建设工程，按照一号平炉出钢要求，也已完成了94％。目前，铁路已经通到平炉所在的主厂房、整模和原料间。供料系统的混铁炉，以及主厂房里启运铁水缶和钢水缶的三百五十吨大天吊，也全部安装好了。一号平炉的供电心脏——四号变电所和供水系统的五号水泵站，已成功地进行了试运转。从高炉和焦炉来的两条粗大的煤气管，也已伸到平炉身旁。这一切预示着：包钢一号平炉烘炉出钢的日子越来越近了。（附图片）
