Anhui Spring Agricultural Production Implements Five Expansions
Cultivated land area expanded – over 7 million mu of wasteland reclaimed this past winter and spring; spring-sown crop area expanded – more than 60% more than last year; multiple cropping index expanded – from 188% last year to 214.7% this year; high-yield crop area expanded – 17 million mu more than last year; improved seed area expanded – improved seeds can be used for 90% of crops

Our newspaper Hefei, 11th dispatch – The people's communes in Anhui Province are demonstrating even greater superiority in this year's spring production. Its outstanding features are great ambition and meticulous work. This year, under the premise of taking grain as the key link and making overall arrangements, the province has expanded the cultivated land area, expanded the spring-sown crop area, expanded the multiple cropping index, expanded the planting area of high-yield crops, and expanded the area of improved seeds. While implementing the "Five Expansions," meticulous cultivation has been carried out from spring land preparation and seedling cultivation.

The "Five Expansions" are important production-increasing measures of "little effort, great results, and rapid production increase" summarized by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee through continuous research of the province's characteristics and mass experience, and are a new development in the promotion of the three agricultural production reforms in Anhui Province. The superior conditions of the people's communes have enabled these measures to be fully implemented this spring.

In terms of expanding the cultivated land area, the people's communes throughout the province have reclaimed more than 7 million mu of wasteland from last winter to this spring. While reclaiming large areas of wasteland, many communes also carried out water conservancy construction, so that the wasteland becomes good paddy fields as soon as it is reclaimed. Chuxian County has reclaimed more than 350,000 mu of wasteland, averaging more than two mu per person based on the county's population. Now the county has planted various crops on more than 160,000 mu of newly reclaimed land, prepared more than 100,000 mu of sweet potato ridges, and the newly opened 50,000 mu of paddy fields are filled with spring water, waiting for rice transplanting.

This year, the province's spring-sown crop area is more than 60% larger than last year. In addition to a large increase in the area of food crops, the spring planting area of various cash crops has also been greatly expanded. The sowing area of ​​cotton and the sowing area of ​​oil crops have both increased significantly compared with last year. Spring tobacco has doubled compared with last year, and hemp has also expanded a lot. Now the plans have been implemented to the teams, the stubble has been arranged to the fields, more than 1.7 million mu of spring-sown grain crops have been planted, and 140,000 mu of hemp have been planted. Because the yield of spring-sown crops is 30% to 50% higher than that of wheat-stubble crops, and it can avoid the droughts and floods that often occur in July and August, as long as the summer harvest crops and spring-sown crops achieve a bumper harvest, more than half of the annual agricultural production increase target can be completed, which will lay a solid foundation for further striving for an autumn harvest and achieving the annual continued great leap forward target.

The expansion of spring-sown crops has created conditions for expanding the multiple cropping index. For example, if spring-sown crops are expanded, another season of late autumn crops can be planted. In addition to the promotion of intercropping and mixed cropping, this year the province's cultivated land multiple cropping index can be expanded from 188% last year to 214.7%, further exerting the potential of the land. In the Wuhu and Anqing rice-producing areas on both sides of the Yangtze River, the area of ​​double-cropping rice this year will increase by more than 1.3 million mu compared with last year. After harvesting double-cropping rice, another season of rapeseed or green manure can be planted. In the Huaibei area, one rice and one wheat crop and spring sweet potatoes intercropped with spring corn have also been greatly expanded this year. In addition, various places have also widely adopted the methods of intercropping mud beans and green manure with mid-season rice, intercropping soybeans on the edges of sweet potato ridges, intercropping spring soybeans with spring corn, and intercropping late soybeans with late corn.

This year, the area of ​​high-yield crops in the province has also increased by 17 million mu compared with last year. In the Huaibei Plain, since last winter, more than 28,000 kilometers of large and small rivers have been newly excavated, and the area of ​​rice replaced from last year's 5 million mu has been expanded to more than 8 million mu. In the eleven counties in hilly and drought-prone areas, due to the changes in the "dead corners of water conservancy," the rice planting area has also increased compared with last year. The province's sweet potato planting area will be more than 2.5 million mu more than last year. Changing to high-yield crops can greatly increase the yield per unit area.

This year, the people's communes throughout the province have also paid special attention to the work of changing to improved varieties. After all kinds of efforts, about 90% of the province's crops can use improved varieties. This is a simple and easy-to-implement production-increasing measure with great effects. Taking rice as an example, improved varieties can increase production by 20% to 80% compared with ordinary varieties.

The people's communes can not only achieve the "Five Expansions" production-increasing measures, but also do more intensive farming than in previous years. The spring land in various places is ploughed deeper and levelled better than in the past, generally ploughed and harrowed one or two more times. Now the fertilizer prepared for spring planting has reached more than 18 billion dan, averaging more than 400 dan per mu. Especially in terms of early seedling cultivation and cultivating strong seedlings, this year is even more refined. The area of ​​early rice and spring rice has increased a lot, but the seedling cultivation work has been brought forward by one solar term. More than 100 million jin of rice seeds have been sown in batches in advance, and the dry seedling cultivation method that can prevent rotten seedlings and cultivate strong seedlings has been fully promoted. In the Wuhu and Anqing areas, more than 500,000 mu of seedling fields have been sown, and more than 100,000 people have been fixed to manage them specifically. The early sown seedlings are already two or three inches high. This year, sweet potato hotbed seedling cultivation was universally implemented in various parts of the province for the first time. The province's spring sweet potato planting area this year is one-third larger than last year. Under such a large sweet potato planting task, the full implementation of hotbed seedling cultivation is also inseparable from the superior conditions of the people's communes (in previous years, only a few early-planted sweet potatoes were subjected to hotbed seedling cultivation). Now more than 630,000 hotbeds have been built in the province, and the sweet potato seeds cultivated per mu have amounted to more than 50 jin, overfulfilling the seedling cultivation task. This ensures early seedling cultivation, early emergence, vigorous seedlings, and fully meets the needs of expanding the spring sweet potato planting area. The nutrient block and nutrient pot seedling cultivation methods, which can cultivate strong seedlings and solve the stubble contradiction by sowing early, have also been widely adopted by the people's communes in various places this year. In the province, more than 670 million cotton nutrient pots have been made. As long as the wheat is harvested, the fat and strong cotton seedlings can be transplanted early to achieve the purpose of increasing cotton production by early sowing.

    采取花力小、收效大、增产快的措施奠定继续大跃进的基础
    安徽春季农业生产实行五扩大
    耕地面积扩大——去冬今春开荒七百多万亩；春播作物面积扩大——比去年多种60％以上；复种指数扩大——由去年的188％增加到今年的214.7％；高产作物面积扩大——比去年增加一千七百万亩；良种面积扩大——90％的庄稼都可采用良种
    本报合肥11日电　安徽省人民公社在今年春季生产中，显示出更大优越性，它的突出的特点就是气魄大，工作细。今年在以粮为纲，全面安排的前提下，全省扩大了耕地面积、扩大了春播作物面积、扩大了复种指数、扩大了高产作物种植面积和扩大了良种面积。在实行“五扩大”的同时，从春季整地、育苗开始，便作到了耕作细致。
    “五扩大”是中共安徽省委不断研究全省特点和群众经验，总结出的“花力小、收效大、增产快”的重要增产措施，是安徽省推行农业生产三项改革的新发展。人民公社的优越条件，使这些措施在今春得到了全面的贯彻。
    在扩大耕地面积方面，全省各人民公社从去年冬季到现在一个冬春，便开出荒地七百多万亩。很多公社在开垦大片荒地的同时，还进行水利建设，使荒地一开出来，就是种水稻的良田。滁县全县开垦出荒地三十五万多亩，按全县人口平均，每人合两亩多。现在这个县已在新开垦的土地上种上各种作物十六万多亩，打好了甘薯垅十多万亩，新开的五万亩水田，已蓄满了春水，等候插秧。
    今年全省的春播作物面积比去年多种60％以上，其中除大量增加了粮食作物面积以外，各种经济作物的春种面积也扩大很多。棉花的播种面积和油料作物的播种面积都比去年显著增加，春烟比去年扩大了一倍，麻类也扩大了很多。现在计划都已落实到队，茬口已安排到田，春播粮食作物已种一百七十多万亩，麻类已种下十四万亩。由于春播作物的产量要比麦茬作物高30％到50％，而且可以避开常在7、8月间发生的旱涝灾害，只要夏收作物和春播作物夺得丰收，全年的农业增产任务就可完成一半以上，这就为进一步争取秋季丰收和实现全年继续大跃进的指标，打下了坚实的基础。
    春播作物的扩大，又为扩大复种指数创造了条件。如春播作物扩大，就可多种一季晚秋作物，再加上间种、套种等办法的推行，今年全省耕地的复种指数就可以由去年的188％扩大到214.7％，进一步发挥土地的潜力。长江两岸的芜湖、安庆两个水稻产区，今年双季稻的面积将比去年增加一百三十多万亩，收了双季稻，还可以种一季油菜或绿肥。淮北地区一稻一麦和春甘薯套种春玉米，今年也扩大很多。此外，各地还普遍采用中稻套种泥豆和绿肥，甘薯垅边间种大豆，春玉米间种春大豆，晚玉米间种晚大豆等办法。
    今年全省高产作物的面积，比去年也扩大了一千七百万亩。在淮北平原，去冬以来，新开挖了二万八千多公里长的大小河道，水稻改种面积由去年的五百万亩扩大到八百多万亩，在丘陵易旱地区的十一个县，由于“水利死角”有了改变，水稻种植面积也比去年增加。全省甘薯的种植面积要比去年多二百五十多万亩。改种高产作物可使单位面积产量提高很多。
    今年全省各人民公社还特别重视改用优良品种的工作，经过千方百计的努力，全省90％左右的庄稼都可采用良种。这是简便易行而效果很大的增产措施，以水稻为例，良种比一般品种能增产20％至80％。
    人民公社不仅能实现“五扩大”的增产措施，而且还做到比往年更加精耕细作。各地的春地比过去犁得深、整得平，一般多耕耙了一两遍。现在为春种准备的肥料已达一百八十多亿担，平均每亩合四百多担。特别在提早育苗和培育壮苗方面，今年更为精细。早稻和春稻面积扩大了很多，而育苗工作却提早了一个节气，已有一亿多斤稻种提前分批落种，而且全面推广了能防止烂秧和培育壮秧的旱墁育秧法。芜湖、安庆两专区已下种的五十多万亩秧田，固定了十多万人专门管理，早播的秧苗，已有二、三寸高。今年第一次在全省各地普遍实行了甘薯的温床育苗。全省今年种春甘薯面积比去年扩大三分之一，在这样大的甘薯种植任务下，能全面实行温床育苗，也是与人民公社的优越条件分不开的（在往年，只有少数早种的甘薯进行温床育苗）。现在全省已建温床六十三万多个，育下的薯种每亩已合五十多斤，超额完成了育苗任务。这就保证了提前育苗、提早出苗、苗旺苗壮，充分满足扩大春甘薯种植面积的需要。能够培育壮苗、又能提早播种解决茬口矛盾的营养块、营养钵育苗法，今年也为各地人民公社广泛采用，全省仅棉花营养钵就已做了六亿七千多万个，只要小麦收割过后，就可以把肥壮的棉苗提早移栽下去，达到棉花早播能增产的目的。
