    Self-Remolding in Practice
    Joint Speech by Members Miao Hainan and Zhang Weicen

    Chairman, esteemed members:

    We have listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 State Budget. We agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC over the past year.

    The 1960 National Economic Plan is a plan for a comprehensive and continuous leap forward. It clearly points out to the people of the whole country the new goals and work guidelines for socialist construction in 1960. It truly inspires the people of the whole country to bravely advance for greater victories. We support these two reports with great excitement and encouragement and are determined to work hard for their implementation.

    Faced with this glorious and great task, we industrialists and businessmen are determined to make achievements and contribute our strength in practical work under the leadership and education of the Party.

    We believe that: conscientiously implementing the spirit of the National Congress of the two associations (China Democratic National Construction Association and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce), educating the members of the two associations, correcting understanding, clarifying the direction, and resolving to "lean to one side" and "fall to one side," actively participating in the three major movements of learning, production, and technical revolution together with workers under the leadership of the Party, and actively serving socialist construction; continuing self-education and self-remolding in service, and earnestly studying theory in connection with reality and in connection with thought, taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. Under the leadership of the Party, promoting the members of the two associations to strive to complete and overfulfill the magnificent 1960 National Economic Plan is the main task of our two associations. From the perspective of the implementation of the spirit among the grassroots backbone of the two associations (Democratic National Construction Association and Federation of Industry and Commerce) in Jinan City, Shandong Province, we believe that it is necessary to first correct understanding, which is mainly the issue of understanding the transformation of industrialists and businessmen in service under the leadership of the Party in the past year. It seems that this is a primary issue. Only with a correct assessment of the changes can we talk about other things, otherwise there is no way to talk about it. For example, in informal discussions on the understanding of "great progress still requires transformation," many people believe that the assessment is too "low," and some even think that they are "stronger than the workers." Some say, "In our enterprise, wherever there are more private personnel, the greater the achievements," fully demonstrating that there is no need for transformation. Regarding the understanding of "still needing transformation," they believe that "still needing transformation is only a matter of nine fingers and one finger." Regarding accepting the leadership of the Party, many people believe that "it is not only verbal compliance but also sincere submission, and it is no longer disobedience but prostration on the ground." Regarding taking the socialist road, they believe that "it is already firm and unwavering," and "the political stance has been basically resolved, but there are still some remnants of capitalist ideology." From the above viewpoints, it is clear that the transformation has been completed. But what is the reality? Just as the Party has taught us, "The great progress of industrialists and businessmen is in comparison with their past situation. For the fundamental transformation from exploiters to laborers, this progress is still far from enough." We believe that the Party's teachings are completely correct. The problems exposed in the meeting also fully illustrate this point. First of all, from the attitude towards the meeting, before the National Congress of the two associations was over, many people had a lot of doubts about the meeting. Some said, "The Beijing meeting is so long, maybe a batch of hats will be removed!" Some said, "Learning at home is so tight, the Beijing meeting is so long, maybe they are going to study the cancellation of fixed interest!" Some industrialists and businessmen went to the representatives to inquire about the news overnight after the representatives returned to Jinan, and said, "My family is big, relying on fixed interest to eat. I can't stand it if the fixed interest is cancelled," and so on. After the start of the city's two associations meeting, many people were skeptical of the meeting, thinking, "This meeting is gentle and mild, why is it called a fairy meeting?" Some believe that "the central government is holding a fairy meeting, can the city and district hold a fairy meeting?" Others believe that "it is the old routine of exposing first, then self-recognition, and finally analyzing and criticizing the end," so some brought inspection materials, ready to review and pass the test. Due to the Party's patient education and the resolute implementation of the gentle and mild policy, worries were gradually eliminated, thoughts were opened up, and many problems were also exposed. Secondly, from the exposed problems, most people still have varying degrees of doubts and precautions about accepting the leadership of the Party, believing that "fate is in the hands of the Party," and "the Party treats private personnel differently." Many people also mistakenly accepted the so-called "lessons" of the anti-Rightist rectification, believing that the Rightists "said the wrong things," "the Party is ruthless" and "crosses the river and demolishes the bridge," and there are many "fears" about the Party, such as fear of mistrust, fear of saying the wrong things, fear of keeping accounts, fear of reckoning, fear of criticism, fear of suffering losses, fear of losing meal tickets, fear of losing votes, fear of mass movements, fear of class struggle, fear of being beaten down with one blow, fear of losing face, fear of not having me, fear of being looked down upon by employees, fear of exposing the identity of private personnel, fear of dirt, fear of tiredness, fear of hardship, fear of doing wrong, fear of taking responsibility, fear of tension, fear of the Great Leap Forward having no end, and so on. The above-mentioned twenty-two "fears" fully confirm that the attitude towards the Party is not sincere submission, but most people still have varying degrees of suspicion and precaution against the Party. Doubts and wavering about taking the socialist road also exist to varying degrees, believing that "more, faster, not good, economical" is impossible, and "a clever woman cannot cook without rice." They are afraid of tension in vigorously carrying out mass movements, and they believe that the people's commune movement is "moved out by the Party using techniques," doubting bumper harvests, and calling for grain shortages, etc. Especially after the Party proposed three cheers, some people thought that "the Great Leap Forward has no end," and even some had resistant emotions, such as some saying, "The Great Leap Forward should have a time limit. Hard struggle for three years is three years, so that people have a goal. Long live the Great Leap Forward, this time it's over, the family can't be taken care of, the elderly can't be taken care of, and even I can't take care of myself. What's the use of building squares and cultural palaces? There's no time to watch them." The feeling of weariness about continuing to accept socialist transformation is also a relatively common problem, such as some saying, "In the past, I took a chartered car, then a tricycle, and now I pull a flatbed truck and participate in production. How can I transform?" Some also said, "Giving up fixed interest requires transforming the position, and also transforming viewpoints, methods, and worldviews. When will the transformation be completed?" Still others say, "It is really difficult to work well, study well, and do social activities well." There are also many people who replace transformation with service, such as some saying, "Serving well means transforming well, and making achievements in service means listening to the Party, which is the root of the root." The thoughts of "accompanying transformation" and "unjust transformation" among the families and small business owners of industrialists and businessmen are also quite common, such as some saying, "I have been an employee for twenty years, and after liberation I became a capitalist. My capitalist is really a liberation brand." The above facts fully demonstrate that they have neither achieved sincere submission to the Party, nor have they achieved unwavering in taking the socialist road, let alone say that "the political stance has been basically resolved." This fully proves that the Party's teaching in affirming the "great progress" of industrialists and businessmen while pointing out that "still needs transformation" is an objective truth. In the process of conveying and implementing the spirit in Jinan City's two associations, under the circumstances that most people basically opened up their minds and put forward problems, the report of the leader was conveyed. Through further discussion and discussion, gentle and mild methods, with debates and disputes, and full exchange of opinions, thoughts were gradually improved, and understanding was basically unified. By inviting model workers to give reports and visiting technical innovation exhibitions, many people were further educated, saw the working class's infinite loyalty to the Party and their unparalleled love for socialism, and realized that they must honestly accept transformation. As some said, "Originally carrying a burden of progress, now when I open it, it is full of small sharks. If I don't quickly throw it away, there is a danger of becoming a big shark." Many people also have a further understanding of the Party and began to realize the correctness and greatness of the Party, realizing that the Party is materialistic. As some said, "After listening to the report of Minister Li, I realized that without the prevalence of five poisons, there would be no Five-Anti Campaign. With the rampant attack of the Rightists, there would be a mass anti-Rightist struggle. Due to the changes in the situation of the industrial and commercial circles, there is today's gentle and mild." Thus, they realized that gentle and mild, rough and stormy, do not depend on the Party, but on whether industrialists and businessmen accept transformation. Fate is in their own hands. At the same time, they also gained a relatively clear understanding of the relationship between service and transformation, realizing that there is transformation in service, but it cannot replace transformation. At the same time, they also realized that service is the foundation, and transformation is not empty talk. Political stance and ideological transformation must be carried out in labor practice. Especially after conveying Chairman Liu's instructions, most people were greatly moved by the Party's meticulous care and consideration for industrialists and businessmen. As some said, "The Party has taken care of everything for us. What else can we say? We must lean to one side, fall to one side, and follow the Party wholeheartedly." Others said, "The Party has taken care of everything for us. If we don't do it well wholeheartedly, we will really be sorry for the Party." Still others said, "In the past, we could not control our own destiny. Now that the Party has taken care of it, our parents have not done this. With a clear conscience, we must do it wholeheartedly." Some elderly industrialists and businessmen said with emotion, "Although I am old, I have no worries. The Party is so good to us. We also have to pat our conscience and do our best with whatever strength we have." Some people, feeling the Party's care and warmth, and in connection with their own hidden thoughts about the Party, also shed tears of shame and gratitude, and were also deeply educated. As some said, "The working class has soaring enthusiasm, turning the world upside down, and doing everything for the country and the people. What else do we industrialists and businessmen think about besides our own fixed interest, high salaries, retirement, sick leave wages, and children going to school? Which side have we taken care of? We have taken care of our own side." Some people also realized that in the great situation of rapid change, the issues of position, who to serve, and worldview are serious problems that we industrialists and businessmen urgently need to solve. Many people also realized that the country has taken care of us, so we must lean to one side, fall to one side, and seriously transform our political stance and thinking, break the bourgeois worldview, establish the proletarian worldview, and live up to the Party and the people. Therefore, they expressed their determination to listen to the Party wholeheartedly, follow the Party wholeheartedly, resolutely overcome the "I" character in mind, and be determined to head towards the socialist side and fall to the socialist side. On the basis of improved ideological awareness, they all expressed their determination to the Party, stating that they would repay the Party's care and warmth with practical actions, and formulated plans to present gifts to "May Day," including learning, transformation, production, technical innovation, and other projects, and launched a wave of challenges and competitions between each other. According to the initial situation of the implementation of the spirit by the two associations in Jinan City, we realize that as long as our two associations resolutely follow the Party's instructions, earnestly and actively convey and implement the spirit of the representatives' congress of the two associations, the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, on the basis of improved ideological awareness, can gradually eliminate all unnecessary ideological concerns under the education of the Party, and can gradually resolve to lean to one side and fall to one side.

    Therefore, we believe that the main task of the two associations in Shandong Province is to earnestly convey and implement the spirit of the representatives' congress of the two associations under the leadership of the local Party committees, centering on the central work of the enterprises, and promote the members of the two associations to study all the documents of the congress in connection with their thoughts and in connection with reality. Summarize experience, from point to surface, to help and promote the successful running of semi-off-the-job and spare-time political schools, and promote the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to study theory regularly and earnestly. We believe that: under the call of the Party's peaceful transformation policy, driven by the great situation, and with the drive and help of the working class, we can strive for more industrialists and businessmen to resolve to "lean to one side and fall to one side," thereby setting off a high tide of transformation and service, and contributing all their strength to complete and overfulfill the 1960 National Economic Plan with this practical action.

    The above speech is for the correction of all members.

    在实践中进行自我改造
    苗海南和张蔚岑委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们听了李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划和李先念副总理所作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告。我们同意陈叔通副主席一年来政协工作报告。
    1960年的国民经济计划，是一个全面持续跃进的计划。它向全国人民明确地指出了1960年社会主义建设的新的奋斗目标和工作方针。它确实鼓舞着全国人民将为更大胜利而奋勇前进。我们以万分兴奋和鼓舞的心情拥护这两个报告，并坚决为其贯彻而努力。
    面临这一光荣伟大的任务，我们工商业者决心在党的领导和教育下，在实际工作中作出成绩贡献我们的力量。
    我们认为：认真贯彻中央两会（中国民主建国会和全国工商业联合会）全国代表大会精神，教育两会成员，端正认识，明确方向，下决心“顾一头”、“一边倒”，在党的领导下，和职工一道积极投入学习、生产、技术革命三大运动，积极为社会主义建设服务；在服务中继续进行自我教育和自我改造，并联系实际地、联系思想地、认真学习理论，以毛主席思想为纲。在党的领导下，推动两会成员为完成和超额完成宏伟的1960年国民经济计划而努力，是我们两会主要任务。从山东省济南市两会，（民建和工商联）在两会基层骨干中贯彻的情况看，我们认为首先必须端正认识，这主要是对工商界一年来在党的领导下，在服务中改造情况的认识问题，看来这是个首要的问题。只有对变化情况有了正确的估计，才能谈到其他，否则无从谈起。如在漫谈对“大有进步还要改造”的认识时，不少人认为估“低”了，甚至认为“比工人还强”，有的说，“我们企业里，哪里私方人员多，哪里的成绩就大”，充分说明已经不需要改造了，对“还要改造”的认识，认为“还要改造只不过是九个指头和一个指头的问题了”，对接受党的领导，不少人认为“不仅是口服心服，而且是心悦诚服，已经不是不服，而是俯伏在地了”。对走社会主义道路，认为“已经坚定不移，丝毫没有动摇了”，“政治立场已经基本解决了，不过还有点资本主义的思想残余而已”。从上述观点看，显然改造已经完成。但事实又怎么样呢？正如党所教导我们的“工商业者的大有进步，是同他们过去的情况比较而言，对于从剥削者变为劳动者的根本改造来说，这个进步还是很不够的”。我们认为，党的教导是完全正确的。从会议中暴露的问题看，也充分说明了这一点。首先从对会议的态度看，在两会全国代表大会还没有结束的时候，就有不少人对会议产生很多疑虑，有的说“北京会议开的这么长，可能要摘一批帽子吧！”有的说“家里学习抓的这么紧，北京会议开的这么长，可能要研究取消定息吧！”有的工商业者在代表回到济南以后，连夜去找代表打听消息，并说“我的家口大，指着定息吃饭，取消了定息我可受不了”等等。在市两会会议开始后，不少人对会议抱怀疑态度，认为“这次会议既是和风细雨，为什么又叫神仙会呢？”有的认为“中央开神仙会，市里区里是否能开神仙会呢？”也有的认为“是老一套先暴露、后自我认识，最后分析批判完事”，因而有的带着检查材料，准备检讨过关。由于党的耐心教育，坚决贯彻了和风细雨的方针，因而逐渐消除了顾虑，敞开了思想，同时也暴露了不少的问题。其次从暴露的问题看，多数人对于接受党的领导还存在着不同程度的疑虑和戒备，认为“命运掌握在党手里”，“党对私方人员不一样看待”，不少人并错误的接受了反右整风的所谓“教训”，认为右派是“说错了话”，“党无情”“过河拆桥”，对党存在很多的“怕”，如怕不信任、怕说错话、怕记账、怕算账、怕批评、怕吃亏、怕掉了饭票、怕丢了选票、怕群众运动、怕阶级斗争、怕一竿子打下去、怕丢面子、怕没有我、怕职工瞧不起、怕暴露私方人员身份、怕脏、怕累、怕苦、怕做错了、怕负责任、怕紧张、怕大跃进没有头等等。以上所说的二十二个“怕”都充分证实了：对党的态度不是心悦诚服了，而是多数人仍然对党还是存在着不同程度的怀疑戒备。对走社会主义道路的怀疑和动摇，也是不同程度的存在着，认为“多快不能好省”“巧妇难做无米炊”。对大搞群众运动害怕紧张，对人民公社化运动，认为是“党用手法迻出来的”，怀疑丰产丰收，叫粮食紧张等等。特别是党提出三个万岁以后，有些人认为“大跃进没有头了，”甚至有的还存有抵触情绪，如有的说“大跃进应该有个年限，苦战三年就是三年，让人有个奔头，大跃进万岁，这回完了，家庭也不能照顾了，老人也不能照顾了，连自己也照顾不了了，修广场、文化宫有什么用？也没有时间去看。”对继续接受社会主义改造的厌倦情绪，也是比较普遍的问题，如有的说“过去坐包车，以后坐三轮，现在拉地排车，并参加了生产，还怎么改造呢。”也有的说“放弃了定息要改造立场，又要改造观点、方法、世界观，到底改造到什么时候算完呢？”还有的说“既要工作好，又要学习和社会活动好，改造真难矣哉”。还有不少人，以服务代替改造，如有的说“服务好了就是改造好了，在服务中做出成绩，就是听党的话，这是根本的根本”。工商业者家属、小业户，“陪改”“改造冤”的思想，也相当普遍，如有的说“我过去当了二十年的职工，解放后当了资本家，我这个资本家真是解放牌的”。以上事实充分说明，既没有做到对党心悦诚服，也没有做到对走社会主义道路坚定不移，更不能说“政治立场基本上解决了”。这充分证明党在肯定工商业者“大有进步”的同时指出“还要改造”的教导，是客观的真理。济南市两会在传达贯彻中在多数人基本敞开了思想，摆出问题的情况下，传达了首长的报告，通过进一步座谈讨论，和风细雨，有争有辩，充分交换意见，逐步提高了思想，基本统一了认识，又通过邀请劳动模范作报告，参观技术革新展览会，不少人又进一步受到教育，看到工人阶级对党的无限忠诚，对社会主义的无比热爱，认识到必须老老实实接受改造，如有的说“原来背着个进步包袱，现在打开一看，里面全是小鲨鱼，如不赶快丢掉，有变成大鲨鱼的危险”。不少人对党也有了进一步的认识，开始认识到党的正确伟大，认识到党是唯物主义的，如有的说“听了传达李部长的报告，才认识到没有五毒泛滥就不会有五反运动，有了右派猖狂进攻，才有群众性的反右派斗争，由于工商界情况的变化，才有今天的和风细雨。”从而认识到和风细雨、粗风暴雨，不决定于党，而决定于工商业者是否接受改造，命运是掌握在自己手里，同时对服务和改造的关系，也获得了比较明确的认识，认识到服务中有改造，但不能代替改造，同时也认识到服务是基础，改造不是空谈，必须在劳动实践中进行政治立场和思想的改造。特别是传达了刘主席的指示以后，大多数人对于党对工商业者无微不至的关怀照顾，受到很大的感动，如有的说，“党对我们包下来了，我们还有什么说的呢？我们必须顾一头，一边倒，一心一意跟党走”。也有的说“党各处都给我们打算到了，再不一心一意好好搞，真对不起党了”。还有的说“过去掌握不了自己的命运，现在党包下来了，我们的父母也没有这样，凭良心也必须一心一意”。有的老年工商业者感动的说“我年纪虽然大了，也没有顾虑了，党对我们这样好，我们也得拍拍良心，要有一分力量尽一分力量”。有些人在体会到党的关怀，温暖，联系到自己对党的心怀鬼胎的情况，还流下了惭愧和感激的眼泪，同时也受到了深刻的教育，如有的说“工人阶级干劲冲天，翻天复地，不顾一切为国家为人民。我们工商业者，除了想自己的定息、高薪、退职退休、病假工资、子女上学等问题以外，还想什么来呢？我们究竟是顾了哪一头呢？我们是顾了自己的一头”。有些人并认识到在一日千里的伟大形势下，立场问题、为谁服务的问题、世界观问题，是我们工商业者迫切需要解决的严重问题。不少人并认识到国家对我们包下来了，我们就必须顾一头、一边倒，认真改造政治立场和思想，破资产阶级世界观，立无产阶级世界观，要对得起党，对得起人民，因而表示要一心一意听党的话，一心一意跟着党走，坚决克服我字当头，决心奔向社会主义一头，倒向社会主义一边。在思想觉悟提高的基础上，都纷纷向党表示了决心，表示：要以实际行动报答党的关怀和温暖，并订出了向“五一”献礼的规划，其中包括学习、改造、生产、技术革新等项目，开展了相互之间的挑战竞赛热潮。根据济南市两会贯彻的初步情况，我们体会到，我们两会组织，只要坚决遵照党的指示，认真积极传达贯彻两会代表大会精神，广大工商业者，在思想觉悟提高的基础上，能够在党的教育下逐步消除一切不必要的思想顾虑，能够逐步下决心顾一头，一边倒。
    因此，我们认为山东省两会组织当前的主要工作是如何认真地在各地党委的领导下，围绕着企业的中心工作，传达贯彻两会代表大会的精神并推动两会成员联系思想，联系实际地学习大会的一切文件。总结经验由点到面地帮助和推动办好半脱产和业余政治学校，推动广大工商业者经常地认真地学习理论。我们相信：在党的和平改造政策的感召下，在大好形势推动下，在工人阶级带动和帮助下，能够争取更多的工商业者下决心“顾一头，一边倒”，从而掀起一个改造和服务的高潮，以此实际行动来为完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划而贡献其一切力量。
    以上发言，请各位委员指正。
