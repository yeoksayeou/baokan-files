Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

    The various reports at the congress have filled me with immense excitement. In particular, the report on the 1960 National Economic Plan demonstrates that, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our country continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1959, completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The 1960 National Economic Plan is a plan for continued leap forward. Striving for continued leap forward this year will lay the foundation for continuous leap forward during the Second Five-Year Plan period and even the entire 1960s. Such brilliant achievements and great goals are truly inspiring, and I am willing to join the people of the whole country in resolutely contributing all our strength to support and implement their realization. Now, I would like to express some views on the transformation and service of industrialists and businessmen.

    Why is Transformation Still Necessary?

    Over the past year or so, under the leadership of the Party and the radiant guidance of the General Line, and under the impetus and influence of the rapid development of the country in all aspects and the broad masses of workers and peasants, we industrialists and businessmen have received tremendous education and encouragement. The vast majority of us have further participated in the practice of serving socialism, and some have even made remarkable achievements. Taking Chongqing as an example, the city's industrialists and businessmen presented 995 major projects as gifts for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1959, the number of industrialists and businessmen selected by enterprises as advanced production (work) personnel reached several thousand each quarter. Some of them were invited to attend representative conferences of advanced production (work) personnel at the municipal, district, and county levels. Two of them were specially invited to attend the National Representative Conference of Advanced Producers. Some family members of industrialists and businessmen were also honorably invited to attend the provincial and municipal conferences of activists in women's socialist construction. Relying on the leadership of the Party and the help of the working masses, some have achieved mechanization of casting, solving key production problems; others have achieved automatic screw production lines, increasing daily output from 2,000 pieces per person by hand to 35,000 pieces per person. Private personnel in a central store in the Shizhong District proposed 1,718 innovation suggestions in January, implemented 786 of them, performed 14,307 good deeds, and received 13,599 written commendations. In the "Good Start" movement, some were awarded the titles of "Craftsman," "All-rounder," or "Expert"; in the "Four Modernizations" movement, some were awarded the title of "Technical Innovation Expert"; and some family members of industrialists and businessmen were also awarded the title of National "March 8th Red Banner Holder." Through the practice of service, there have also been significant changes in political ideology. Many have continued to develop in a positive direction in terms of accepting the leadership of the Party, taking the socialist road, their relationship with the working people, and participation in labor and study.

    All this shows that industrialists and businessmen and their families have taken another big step forward on the road of transforming from bourgeois elements to laborers. This is the good aspect, the mainstream, and should be affirmed. However, it must also be seen that, on the other hand, there are still many fundamental problems.

    Regarding accepting the leadership of the Party, most people still have varying degrees of doubts and wariness. For example, recently, in Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles, during the communication and study of the documents from the national representative conferences of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, some people said: "'Can't doubt' still has some doubt, 'Can't pretend' is done better by everyone." Because of the existence of "doubt" and "pretend," there is "fear of mixing with Party and League members," and "when the Party branch secretary comes, walk away, say as little as possible." Regarding taking the socialist road, most people still have varying degrees of doubt and wavering. There is insufficient understanding of the absolute correctness of the General Line, the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes. There is still more or less doubt, wavering, and dissatisfaction. They are also not accustomed to or even resistant to the socialist distribution system. Many people are reluctantly passive towards the Good Start and Red-to-the-End movements, only wanting to be "red for a few days." Regarding the relationship with the working people, many people, especially some engineering and technical personnel, are still not convinced about learning from the working class, especially learning from the workers in their own enterprises. Some believe that "only master craftsmen and pacesetters on the production front are worth learning from." Regarding participation in labor and study, participation in labor is "very reluctant, dragging behind," and a love for labor and habit have not yet been cultivated. Regarding participation in study, some believe that "study contradicts work," pitting study against work; others are afraid of digging into their thoughts, and are not yet fully accustomed to and understanding the important weapon of criticism and self-criticism for self-education. Therefore, there are problems with the attitude, viewpoint, and method of learning. The problems existing in all the above aspects are essentially problems of transformation. This shows that the acceptance of socialist transformation is not wholehearted.

    In summary, this proves that although industrialists and businessmen have made great progress in the past year or so, they have not progressed to the point where the majority have solved or basically solved the problem of political stance. Now, our country's socialist revolution is deepening further, socialist construction is continuing to leap forward, and our progress is only a beginning, and cannot fully adapt to the requirements of the development of the situation. We must continue to carry out the fundamental transformation of political stance and ideology according to the spirit of continuous revolution; and we should combine service and transformation more closely, and further strive for a "double harvest" of service and transformation.

    Conscientiously Establish the Viewpoint of Combining Service and Transformation

    The issue of conscientiously establishing the viewpoint of combining service and transformation is the issue of correctly treating the relationship between labor practice and political and ideological transformation.

    There have been and are still disagreements on this issue. For example, recently, some people in Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles still believe that: "Service is the concrete manifestation of transformation. Good service shows good transformation." "Service doesn't necessarily require good transformation to be good." This view is not comprehensive. In essence, it confuses service with transformation, replacing transformation with service.

    Facts have proven that service is not equal to transformation, and service cannot replace transformation. In between, there is the issue of motive, the issue of who to serve. Is it for personal gain? Or for socialism? Without political and ideological leadership, it is difficult to serve socialism. The continuous progress of political ideology can promote labor practice, and positive labor practice can create favorable conditions for further transformation of political ideology. Therefore, it is said that there is transformation in service. These are also "two legs," and the two cannot be divided and exist in isolation. It is necessary to grasp both service and transformation, so that they are dialectically unified and closely combined in practice. Only such labor practice is not blind but conscious labor practice; only such transformation is not abstract but concrete transformation. The commander is the commander of the three armies. Grasping the commander can promote everything. Therefore, for service and transformation, on the one hand, we must treat them comprehensively and not lose sight of one thing while attending to another; on the other hand, we cannot understand the "two legs" in the development process as simply mechanical juxtaposition.

    In the new stage of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward has continuously raised the requirements for labor practice, and has also continuously raised the requirements for political and ideological transformation. In our daily labor practice, we all include and carry out the struggle of self-education and self-transformation, including and carrying out the struggle of "promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie," and "destroying the bourgeois and establishing the socialist." The leadership of the Party, taking the socialist road, the relationship with the working people, and the Party's line, principles, and policies will all be reflected in our labor practice, requiring us to consciously treat them correctly. In such a situation and environment, we combine service and transformation, constantly accepting education and accepting tests. The positive factors in our ideological field will certainly gradually increase, and the negative factors will certainly gradually weaken.

    From the point of view of epistemology, the relationship between service and transformation can also be said to be the relationship between practice and knowledge. The process of serving socialism is the process of developing an understanding of socialism. It is also the process of gradually transforming the bourgeois worldview and gradually mastering the proletarian worldview. This process is not a short process. Relaxing self-transformation, thinking that "I am the same as the workers, no transformation is needed," "not talking about transformation can stimulate enthusiasm," is certainly wrong, but any impatience with self-transformation is also unrealistic. Only by practicing, knowing, re-practicing, and re-knowing, and continuing for a long time, repeatedly, and continuously, can we achieve wholeheartedly "caring for one side" and "leaning to one side," and can we successfully complete the task of self-transformation.

    The Key to Further Accepting Transformation

    "Caring for one side" and "leaning to one side" are the current goals of struggle for industrialists and businessmen to further accept socialist transformation, and are also the key issues for industrialists and businessmen to further accept socialist transformation.

    Many industrialists and businessmen have problems in dealing with the relationship between personal interests and the interests of the state and the people. Some people in Chongqing's industrial and commercial circles said: "Caring for the interests of the state will affect personal interests." "Caring for one side and leaning to one side is not easy. Overcoming individualism is more difficult than ascending to heaven." Some people said: "I have long cared for one side, but the side I care for is my family." Others said: "Putting 'I' first is a matter of human nature. This problem can only be solved when materials are abundant and everyone gets what they need." These views, ideas, and practices, as another industrialist and businessman said, "Although the number of achievements made by industrial and commercial circles in service is gradually increasing, those who truly care for the interests of the state and the people from the bottom of their hearts and lean to the side of socialism are still in the minority." That is to say, many industrialists and businessmen still lack a correct understanding and attitude towards handling the relationship between personal interests and the interests of the state and the people; they still lack sufficient courage and determination to overcome bourgeois individualism and transform the bourgeois worldview.

    How should we treat the relationship between personal interests and the interests of the state and the people? I think:

    First, we must be good at handling the contradictions between personal interests and the interests of the state and the people.

    The bourgeoisie, as an exploiting class, is bound to be eliminated; bourgeois elements, as individual exploiters, can be gradually transformed from exploiters into self-reliant laborers through socialist transformation. In the process of transformation, the Party and the government have always adopted a policy of taking care of the reasonable interests of industrialists and businessmen in politics and economics, and have taken care of them meticulously. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's instructions once again proved this. Many industrialists and businessmen were moved to tears after hearing the communication. It can be seen that as long as we can be determined to "care for one side" and "lean to one side," and wholeheartedly serve socialism, our reasonable personal interests will certainly be taken care of by the Party and the government, and will be taken care of to the end. We should firmly trust the Party and need not have any worries.

    At the same time, we should also see that the superiority of the socialist system provides a prerequisite for the combination of personal interests and the interests of the state and the people, because the improvement of personal material and cultural life depends on the achievements of socialist construction. Therefore, the highest, most fundamental, and most long-term interests of individuals are to build socialism. In this sense, the personal interests of industrialists and businessmen are completely consistent with the interests of the state and the people. However, consistency does not mean no contradictions. Because our bourgeois stand, viewpoints, methods, styles, and lives and habits have not been fundamentally transformed, contradictions objectively exist. The question is how we handle this contradiction. Should personal interests be subordinate to the interests of the state and the people? Or should the interests of the state and the people be subordinate to personal interests? I believe that the only correct way to deal with this is to adhere to the fundamental principle that personal interests are subordinate to the interests of the state and the people. Because only under the premise that the interests of the state and the people are constantly increasing and the cause of socialist construction is constantly developing can the personal interests of industrialists and businessmen be guaranteed and continuously increased. Only by wholeheartedly caring for the interests of the state and the people, and wholeheartedly leaning to the side of socialism, can industrialists and businessmen gain the trust of the Party and the people, and thereby receive corresponding rewards. As a result, it is a win-win situation, and both sides benefit. Conversely, if personal interests are taken as a prerequisite, and the interests of the state and the people are disregarded, not only will the interests of the state and the people be harmed, but also one's own personal interests will be shattered. As a result, one will try to gain but lose instead, and nothing will be gained on either side.

    These are two attitudes, two methods, and two results of dealing with the contradiction between personal interests and the interests of the state and the people. We should make a wise choice.

    Second, we must resolutely overcome bourgeois individualism and transform the bourgeois worldview.

    Bourgeois individualism is a characteristic of the ideological essence of industrialists and businessmen. But this is not a general ideological problem, but a world view problem that determines our spiritual outlook and determines all our words and deeds. In the current transition period, the opposition between bourgeois individualism and the bourgeois world view and proletarian collectivism and the proletarian world view is the struggle between two classes (the proletariat and the bourgeoisie) and two roads (socialism and capitalism).

    With the continued leap forward of socialist construction and the continued deepening of the socialist revolution, the reactionary nature of bourgeois individualism and the bourgeois world view has been further exposed, and has become the target of public criticism. Socialist public ownership is not only the material basis for promoting collectivist thought, but also the material basis for eliminating individualistic thought. Facing such a situation, it is not good and worrisome to still be deeply attached to the private ownership in our minds—the bourgeois individualistic worldview, and want to keep it more or less or even intact. If we have a position of individualism, we will not have a position of collectivism. If the thought of "I" as the center of everything is not overcome, one will inevitably only want "everyone for me," and will not be willing to "I for everyone." One will inevitably put personal interests in a supreme position, and will not see the prospects of socialism and communism, will not see the future of the country and the people, and will not see that the interests of the state and the people contain one's own long-term interests. Therefore, one will oppose the personal temporary interests to the interests of the state and the people. How can such a world view talk about wholeheartedly "caring for one side" and "leaning to one side"?

    It is not difficult to understand that the selfish desires of individualists will never be satisfied. Generally speaking, this is originally an ideological problem, but it is also a problem of stand, viewpoint, and method, that is, a problem of worldview. If one does not consciously and seriously transform oneself, but allows it to develop freely, it is very likely that the ideological problem will develop into a political problem, that is, from ideological reaction to political reaction, and from contradictions among the people to contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. This is something we should be vigilant about. Therefore, we must resolutely overcome bourgeois individualism and conscientiously transform the bourgeois worldview.

    I remember that Du Fu has two lines of poetry like this: "The new pine hates not being a thousand feet high, and the evil bamboo must be cut down by ten thousand culms!" Bourgeois individualism and the bourgeois world view, that is, the capitalist side, can be said to be the "evil bamboo" in our ideological field, and we must make up our minds to cut them off completely. Proletarian collectivism and the proletarian world view, that is, the socialist side, can be said to be the "new pine" that is initially planted in our ideological field, and we must diligently irrigate and actively cultivate them. This is the problem of "destruction" and "establishment". "More destruction" is needed to "establish more", and "great destruction" is needed to "establish greatly". How to destroy and establish greatly? I think there are two main ways: one is to strive to study Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's works are the creative development of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution. We must learn to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to greatly destroy bourgeois individualism and the bourgeois worldview, and gradually establish proletarian collectivism and the proletarian worldview. The other is to strengthen transformation in the labor practice of serving socialism. In class society, the bourgeois individualistic worldview is spontaneously generated, while the proletarian collectivist worldview is gradually established in the continuous economic struggle, political struggle, and ideological struggle. If industrialists and businessmen leave the concrete labor practice of serving socialism, they cannot effectively gradually transform the bourgeois individualistic worldview.

    Our industrialists and businessmen must constantly study in labor practice, deeply understand the spirit of Chairman Liu's instructions to "care for one side" and "lean to one side," and implement it into action. We will certainly be able to gradually transform the bourgeois individualistic worldview, and we will certainly be able to wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly follow the Party, wholeheartedly accept transformation, and wholeheartedly serve socialism.

    Please criticize and correct the above immature opinions.

### 工商业者要改造得好服务得好  温少鹤委员的发言

专栏：

    工商业者要改造得好服务得好
    温少鹤委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    大会中的各项报告，使我感到无比兴奋。尤其是关于1960年国民经济计划的报告，显示我国在1958年大跃进的基础上，在1959年继续实现了国民经济的大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。1960年国民经济计划是继续跃进的计划，努力争取这一年的继续跃进，就将为第二个五年计划期间以至整个六十年代的连续跃进奠定基础。这种辉煌成就和伟大目标，真令人欢欣鼓舞，我愿与全国人民一道，坚决为拥护贯彻其实现贡献一切力量。现在，我想就工商业者改造与服务的问题，发表一些意见。
    为什么还要改造？
    一年多来，我们工商业者，在党的领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，在国家各方面飞跃发展的形势和广大工农群众的推动和影响下，受到极大的教育和鼓舞，绝大多数人，进一步参加了为社会主义服务的实践，一部分人还作出了显著的成绩。以重庆市为例，全市工商业者，向建国十周年献礼的重大项目达九百九十五件。1959年，被企业评选为先进生产（工作）者的工商业者，每一季度，均达一千几百人。其中一部分人被邀请出席市、区、县先进生产（工作）者代表大会。还有两人被特邀出席全国先进生产者代表大会。工商业者家属，有的也光荣地被邀出席了省、市妇女社会主义建设积极分子代表大会。依靠党的领导和工人群众的帮助，有的实现了铸工机械化，解决了生产上的关键问题；有的实现了螺丝生产自动线，由原来三人手工操作日产二千只提高到一人日产三万五千只。市中区一个中心商店的私方人员，在1月份提出了革新建议一千七百一十八件，实现了七百八十六件，大办好事一万四千三百零七件，得到书面表扬一万三千五百九十九件。在夺取“开门红”运动中，有的被授予“巧手”、“全能手”或“能手”的称号；在“四化”运动中，有的被授予“技术革新能手”的称号；有的工商业者家属，还被授予全国“‘三八’红旗手”的称号。通过服务的实践，政治思想上也有显著的变化。许多人在接受党的领导、走社会主义道路、同劳动人民的关系和参加劳动与学习方面，都继续在向好的方向发展。
    这一切表明，工商业者及其家属，在由资产阶级分子向劳动者转化的道路上又前进了一大步。这是好的方面、是主流，应当肯定。但是，也必须看到，另一方面，还有不少带根本性的问题。
    对于接受党的领导方面，多数人还不同程度地存在着疑虑戒备。例如，最近重庆市工商界，在传达、学习中国民主建国会、全国工商联两会全国代表大会文件中，有人说：“‘疑不得’还是有点疑，‘假不得’大家做得比较好。”由于存在着“疑”与“假”，所以“怕与党、团员打堆”，“看到党支书来了，就走开，少说为妙”。对于走社会主义道路方面，多数人还不同程度地存在着怀疑动摇。对总路线的绝对正确、大跃进的伟大成就和人民公社的无比优越认识不足，还有或多或少的怀疑、动摇和不满。对社会主义的分配制度也不习惯甚至抵触。对待开门红、红到底运动，很多人勉强被动，只想“红几天”。在同劳动人民的关系方面，不少人特别是有些工程技术人员，对于向工人阶级学习，尤其是向本企业的工人学习，还不服气。有的认为“只有老师傅和生产战线上的标兵才值得学习”。在参加劳动和学习方面，对于参加劳动“很勉强，跟倒拖”，还没有培养起热爱劳动的感情和习惯。对于参加学习，有的认为“学习与工作矛盾”，把学习与工作对立起来；有的怕挖思想，对于运用批评与自我批评这一个进行自我教育的重要武器，还不完全习惯和理解。因之，学习的态度、观点和方法都有问题。以上各方面存在的问题，实质上都是改造问题。这说明，对于接受社会主义改造，还不是一心一意。
    综上所述，是证明工商业者，一年多来，虽然大有进步，但是并没有进步到多数人解决了或者基本上解决了政治立场问题的境界。现在，我们国家的社会主义革命更加深入、社会主义建设正持续跃进，我们的进步，仅仅是一个开端，还不能完全适应形势发展的要求，必须根据不断革命的精神，继续进行政治立场和思想的根本改造；并且应当把服务与改造更加紧密地结合起来，进一步力争服务与改造“双丰收”。
    认真树立服务与改造相结合的观点
    认真树立服务与改造相结合的观点问题，就是正确对待劳动实践与政治思想改造的关系问题。
    对于这个问题的看法，过去有现在也不是完全没有分歧的。例如，重庆市工商界中，最近还有人认为：“服务是改造的具体表现，服务得好，就说明改造得好。”“不一定改造得好，服务才好。”这个看法，是不全面的。实质上，是把服务与改造混同起来，以服务代替改造。
    事实证明，服务不等于改造，服务也不能代替改造。这中间，有动机问题，有为谁服务问题。为个人打算吗为社会主义？政治思想不挂帅，是很难为社会主义服务的。政治思想的不断进步可以推动劳动实践，积极劳动实践又可以为政治思想的进一步改造创造有利条件，所以说服务之中有改造，这也是“两条腿”，二者不能分割而孤立存在的。必须既抓服务，又抓改造，使它们在实践中辩证地统一起来、紧密地结合起来。只有这样的劳动实践，才不是盲目的而是自觉的劳动实践；只有这样的改造，才不是抽象的而是具体的改造。统帅是三军司令，抓住了统帅，就能推动一切。因此，对于服务与改造，我们一方面要全面对待，不能顾此失彼；另一方面，也不能把发展过程中的“两条腿”理解为简单地机械的平列。
    在社会主义建设的新阶段中，大跃进不断提高了对劳动实践的要求，也不断提出了对政治思想改造的要求，我们在每日每时的劳动实践中，都包括着也进行着自我教育、自我改造的斗争，都包括着也进行着“兴无灭资”、“破资立社”的斗争。党的领导、走社会主义道路、同劳动人民的关系，以及党的路线、方针、政策等问题，都会在我们的劳动实践中体现出来，要求我们自觉地正确对待。我们在这样的形势下、这样的环境中，把服务与改造结合起来，不断接受教育、接受考验，我们思想领域中的积极因素一定可以逐步增长，消积因素一定可以逐步削弱。
    服务与改造的关系，从认识论的观点来看，也可以说是实践与认识的关系。为社会主义服务的实践过程，就是对社会主义认识的发展过程。也就是逐步改造资产阶级世界观和逐步掌握无产阶级世界观的过程。这个过程，不是一个较短的过程。放松自我改造，认为“与职工一样了，不需要改造了”，“不谈改造，才能发挥积极性”，固然是错误的，但对自我改造的任何急躁情绪，也是不切合实际的。只有实践、认识、再实践、再认识，长期地、反复地、不断地进行下去，才能做到一心一意地“顾一头”、“一边倒”，才能胜利完成自我改造任务。
    进一步接受改造的关键问题
    “顾一头”、“一边倒”，是当前工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造的奋斗目标，也是当前工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造的关键问题。
    工商业者不少人在对待个人利益同国家利益和人民利益的关系上是有问题的。重庆市工商界就有人说：“要顾国家利益是会影响个人利益的。”“‘顾一头’、‘一边倒’不容易，克服个人主义比升天还难。”有人说：“我早已
  ‘顾一头’，但顾的是家里的一头。”也有人说：“‘我’字当头，是人的本性问题，必须是物资丰富了，做到各取所需时，才能解决这个问题。”这些看法、想法和做法，正如另一位工商业者说的：“尽管工商界在服务中做出成绩的逐渐增多，但真正从思想感情上顾国家利益、人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边的，还是少数。”这即是说，工商业者很多人对于处理个人利益同国家利益和人民利益的关系，还缺乏正确的认识和态度；对于克服资产阶级个人主义、改造资产阶级世界观，还缺乏足够的勇气和决心。
    应当怎样对待个人利益同国家利益和人民利益的关系呢？我认为：
    第一，要善于处理个人利益同国家利益和人民利益之间的矛盾
    资产阶级作为一个剥削阶级来说，那是必然要消灭的；资产阶级分子作为一个剥削者个人来说，那是可以通过社会主义改造，由剥削者逐步转化为自食其力的劳动者的。在转化过程中，党和政府对工商业者在政治上和经济上的合理利益，一直采取包下来的政策，照顾得无微不至。刘少奇主席的指示，再一次证明了这一点，不少工商业者，听了传达以后，感动得流下泪来。可见，只要我们能够下决心“顾一头”、“一边倒”，一心一意地为社会主义服务，我们合理的个人利益，是一定会得到党和政府的照顾，而且会照顾到底的。我们应当坚决信赖党，不必有丝毫顾虑。
    同时，我们还应当看到，社会主义制度的优越性，给个人利益同国家利益和人民利益相结合提供了前提，因为个人物质和文化生活的提高，取决于社会主义建设的成就。所以，个人最高、最根本、最长远的利益就是建设社会主义。从这个意义上讲，工商业者的个人利益同国家利益和人民利益是完全一致的。但是，一致不等于没有矛盾，由于我们资产阶级的立场、观点、方法、作风和生活、习惯，还没有得到根本改造，矛盾是客观存在的。问题在于我们如何处理这个矛盾。是让个人利益服从国家利益和人民利益呢？或者是让国家利益和人民利益服从个人利益？我认为，唯一正确的处理方法，是坚持个人利益服从国家利益和人民利益的根本原则。因为只有在国家利益和人民利益不断增加，社会主义建设事业不断发展的前提下，工商业者的个人利益才能得到保障并不断增长，工商业者也只有一心一意地顾国家利益和人民利益这一头，一心一意地倒向社会主义这一边，才能得到党和人民的信任，并从而得到相应的报酬。其结果，是一举两得，两头都有。反之，如果以个人利益为前提，而置国家利益和人民利益于不顾，不仅损害了国家利益和人民利益，而且自己的个人利益也会破灭。其结果，是欲得反失。两头无着。
    这是处理个人利益同国家利益和人民利益之间的矛盾的两种态度、两种方法和两种结果。我们是应当有一个明智的抉择的。
    第二，要坚决克服资产阶级个人主义、改造资产阶级世界观
    资产阶级个人主义是工商业者思想本质的特点。但这不是一般的思想问题，而是决定我们的精神面貌，决定我们的一切言行的世界观问题。在当前过渡时期，资产阶级个人主义、资产阶级世界观和无产阶级集体主义、无产阶级世界观的对立，就是两个阶级（无产阶级和资产阶级）和两条道路（社会主义和资本主义）的斗争。
    随着社会主义建设的继续跃进和社会主义革命的继续深入，资产阶级个人主义、资产阶级世界观的反动性，进一步被揭露了出来，已经成为众矢之“的”。社会主义公有制不仅是发扬集体主义思想的物质基础，而且也是消灭个人主义思想的物质基础。我们面对着这样的形势，还对我们头脑中的私有制——资产阶级个人主义的世界观，一往情深，难割难舍，还想把它或多或少的甚至原封不动的保持下来，那是很不好、很可虑的。我们有了个人主义的阵地，就没有集体主义的阵地。一切以“我”为中心的思想不克服，必然是只想“人人为我”，而不愿“我为人人”，必然把个人利益摆在至高无上的地位，看不见社会主义和共产主义的远景，看不见国家和人民的前途，看不见国家利益和人民利益中包含有自己个人的长远利益，因而把个人的暂时利益同国家利益和人民利益对立起来。这样的世界观怎么谈得到一心一意地“顾一头”、“一边倒”呢？
    不难理解，个人主义者的私欲是永远不会满足的，一般说来，这本来是思想问题，但也是立场、观点和方法问题，也就是世界观问题。如果不自觉地认真改造，而听其自由发展，就很有可能由思想问题发展为政治问题，即是说，由思想上的反动发展为政治上的反动，由人民内部矛盾转化为敌我矛盾。这是值得我们警惕的。所以，我们必须坚决克服资产阶级个人主义、认真改造资产阶级世界观。
    记得杜甫有这样两句诗：“新松恨不高千尺，恶竹应须斩万竿！”资产阶级个人主义、资产阶级世界观，也就是资本主义的一面，可以说是我们思想领域中的“恶竹”，必须痛下决心，斩尽除绝。无产阶级集体主义、无产阶级世界观，也就是社会主义的一面，可以说是我们思想领域中初植的“新松”，必须辛勤灌溉，积极培养。这就是“破”与“立”的问题。要“多破”才能“多立”，“大破”才能“大立”。怎样大破大立呢？我以为主要的途径有两条：一条是努力学习马克思列宁主义，特别是毛主席的著作。毛主席著作是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的创造性的发展。我们必须学会以毛泽东思想武器来大破资产阶级个人主义和资产阶级世界观，并逐步树立无产阶级集体主义、无产阶级世界观。另一条是在为社会主义服务的劳动实践中加强改造。在阶级社会中，资产阶级个人主义的世界观，是自发产生的，而无产阶级集体主义的世界观，是在不断的经济斗争、政治斗争和思想斗争中逐渐树立起来的。工商业者离开了为社会主义服务的具体的劳动实践，就不能有效地逐步改造资产阶级个人主义的世界观。
    我们工商业者必须在劳动实践中，不断进行学习，深入领会刘主席指示“顾一头”、“一边倒”的精神，并贯彻到行动中去，就一定能够逐步改造资产阶级个人主义的世界观，一定能够做到一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟着党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务。
    以上这些不成熟的意见，敬请批评指正。
