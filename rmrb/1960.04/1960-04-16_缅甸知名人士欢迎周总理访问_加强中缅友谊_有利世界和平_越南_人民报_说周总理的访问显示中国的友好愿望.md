Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 14th: On the eve of Premier Zhou Enlai's arrival in Burma for a visit, many prominent Burmese figures expressed their welcome for the visit and warmly congratulated the further development of Sino-Burmese friendship.

The chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the famous writer Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, said that Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to Burma will further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries and is conducive to world peace. He pointed out that since ancient times, China and Burma have been like "Pauk-Phaw" (meaning compatriots), and now this kinship has developed on a new basis.

The 86-year-old leader of the Burmese peace movement said, "The Sino-Burmese border issue, which has been unresolved for nearly a century, has been resolved. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression is a brilliant achievement in Burmese history and a new page in the development of Sino-Burmese history."

Dr. Htin Baw, chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association, believes that after the signing of the Sino-Burmese agreement on the border issue and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma is of great historical significance, and Sino-Burmese friendly relations will be further strengthened.

Dr. Htin Baw pointed out that the development of Sino-Burmese friendship over the past decade has been satisfactory. The resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue has brought the development of Sino-Burmese relations into a new stage. "It is a great achievement of the people of China and Burma and a failure for the imperialists and colonialists who conspire to undermine Sino-Burmese friendly relations."

The Vice-Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, U Bha Kin Yang Tha, said, "I have been to China, and I am very happy about the friendly visit of the leader of our neighboring country."

U Bha Kin Yang Tha emphasized, "China and Burma have had close and friendly relations since ancient times. I am particularly pleased with the successful signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese agreement on the border issue. This is a serious blow to the imperialists."

The Kachin State leader Duwa Sinwa Naw expressed his firm support for the signing of the Sino-Burmese agreement on the border issue. He said that since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have made great achievements in industrial and agricultural construction. He expressed his firm belief that the Chinese people will never take aggressive actions against others.

The General Secretary of the Burma Trade Union Congress, U Mya Myint, welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma during the Burmese New Year and the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. He said, "I am confident that Premier Zhou Enlai's trip to Burma, India, and Nepal will greatly benefit peace in Asia and the world, and further uphold the spirit of the Bandung Conference."

U Mya Myint said, "The Burmese working class is very pleased with the complete resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue." He expressed his hope that the Sino-Indian border issue would be resolved as soon as possible, so that the imperialists could not realize their conspiracy to sow discord among Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 15th: The "New Rangoon Daily" said in an editorial today entitled "Welcome Premier Zhou's Visit to Burma" that China and Burma have been two neighboring countries coexisting harmoniously since ancient times, especially since the independence of China and Burma, the friendship between the two countries has had new developments on a new basis. Cultural and economic cooperation has achieved brilliant achievements. Especially in 1957, the government of the People's Republic of China helped Burma establish the Thamaing State Textile Factory, equipped the factory with a complete set of machinery and equipment, and sent experts to Burma to be responsible for the construction project and help train workers. This has produced a good impression among the Burmese government and people.

The newspaper emphasized that the signing of the Sino-Burmese agreement on the border issue and the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression marks a new stage in the relations between the two countries. As Premier Zhou Enlai said, "This is a victory for the people of our two countries, and it is a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

The editorial concluded, "China and Burma have a long history of friendly relations. Geographical conditions make the friendly relations between our two countries closer, and with the illumination of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the road ahead of us is brighter than ever."

The "People's Daily" and the "New Rangoon Daily" also published special editions this morning to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 15th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today entitled "A Visit for Peace and Friendship Among Asian Countries," congratulating Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, India, Nepal and other countries on achieving good results, and wishing the great solidarity of the people of Asian and African countries to be continuously consolidated and developed.

The commentary said that for several years, the Chinese government and people have consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma. China has consistently and clearly expressed its hope to consolidate and develop friendly relations with Asian countries, especially with its neighboring countries. This correct policy of China has recently been reflected once again in the treaties and agreements full of friendly spirit concluded between China and Burma and Nepal. The issue of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia has also begun to be resolved. Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to India and his negotiations with Prime Minister Nehru on the Sino-Indian border issue bring hope to the people that the Sino-Indian border issue will be properly resolved, and the friendly relations between China and India, the two largest countries in Asia, will be consolidated.

The commentary said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to some Asian countries further demonstrates the sincere desire of the Chinese government and people to further develop friendly relations between China and various Asian countries. This kind of friendly relationship is an important factor in strengthening the solidarity of Asia and Africa to oppose imperialism and colonialism. Therefore, the people of Asia welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit.

The commentary pointed out that only imperialists and their lackeys feel uneasy about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit. This is because this visit will give a head-on blow to the imperialists who attempt to use all means to alienate the relations between China and Asian and African nationalist countries.

The commentary also pointed out that the imperialists will still try their best to undermine the efforts made by China and Asian and African countries to develop international peace and friendship. However, they will inevitably suffer even more tragic defeats.

    缅甸知名人士欢迎周总理访问
    加强中缅友谊　有利世界和平
    越南“人民报”说周总理的访问显示中国的友好愿望
    新华社仰光14日电　在周恩来总理到达缅甸进行访问前夕，缅甸许多知名人士都对这次访问表示欢迎，并热忱地祝贺中缅友谊得到进一步发展。
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席、著名作家德钦哥都迈说，周恩来总理即将对缅甸进行的访问将进一步加强两国的友好关系并有利于世界和平。他指出，自古以来中缅两国就像“胞波”（意即同胞）一样，而现在这种亲戚关系在新的基础上有了发展。
    这位八十六高龄的缅甸和平运动领袖说，“约百年来悬而未决的中缅边界问题解决了。中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订是缅甸历史上光辉的成就，是中缅历史发展中的新的一页。”
    缅中友好协会主席信波博士认为，在中缅关于边界问题的协定和中缅友好和互不侵犯条约签订以后，周恩来总理对缅甸的访问是具有重大历史意义的，中缅友好关系将会进一步得到加强。
    信波博士指出，过去十年来中缅友谊的发展是令人满意的。中缅边界问题的解决使中缅关系的发展进入新阶段。“它是中缅两国人民的一个伟大成就，是阴谋破坏中缅友好关系的帝国主义者、殖民主义者的一个失败。”
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会副主席吴彬养素达法师说，“我曾经到过中国，我对于我们邻国政府领袖的友好访问，感到非常高兴。”
    吴彬养素达强调指出，“中缅两国自古以来就有密切友好的关系。我对于中缅友好和互不侵犯条约以及中缅关于边界问题的协定的成功签订，感到特别高兴。这是对帝国主义者的一个严重打击。”
    克钦邦领袖杜瓦信瓦瑙对于中缅签订关于边界问题的协定表示坚决的支持。他说，自从中华人民共和国建立以来，中国人民在工农业建设方面取得了伟大的成就。他表示坚信中国人民决不会对别人采取侵略行动。
    缅甸工会大会总书记吴苗密欢迎周恩来总理在缅甸新年和万隆会议五周年的时候到缅甸访问。他说，“我确信，周恩来总理的缅甸、印度、尼泊尔之行将会大大有利于亚洲和世界的和平，并进一步维护万隆会议精神。”
    吴苗密说，“缅甸工人阶级对于中缅边界问题的彻底解决，感到非常高兴。”他表示希望早日解决中印边界问题，从而使帝国主义者不能在亚洲国家之间实现散播不和的阴谋。
    新华社仰光15日电　“新仰光报”今天在一篇题为“欢迎周总理访问缅甸”的社论中说，自古以来，中国和缅甸是和谐地共处的两个邻国，特别是自从中缅两国取得独立以来，两国友谊在新的基础上有了新的发展。文化和经济合作已经取得了光辉的成就。特别是在1957年，中华人民共和国政府帮助缅甸建立了达棉国营纺织厂，用整套机械设备装配了这家工厂，并且派专家到缅甸来，负责修建工程和帮助训练工人。这在缅甸政府和人民中产生了良好的印象。
    这家报纸强调说，中缅两国关于边界问题的协定和友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，标志着两国关系进入了一个新的阶段。正如周恩来总理所说的，“这是我们两国人民的胜利，这是关于和平共处五项原则的胜利。”
    社论最后说，“中国和缅甸具有悠久友好的关系。地理条件使得我们两国的友好关系更加密切，加上和平共处五项原则的照耀，我们面前的道路比以往任何时候更加光明。”
    “人民报”和“新仰光报”还在今天清晨发表号外，欢迎周恩来总理访问缅甸。
    新华社河内15日电　越南“人民报”今天以“为了亚洲各国的和平和友谊的一次访问”为题发表评论，祝周恩来总理访问缅甸、印度、尼泊尔等国取得良好成果，并祝亚非各国人民的伟大团结不断地巩固和发展。
    评论说，几年来，中国政府和人民一贯坚持地奉行着由中国同印度、缅甸共同倡导的和平共处五项原则。中国一贯明确地表示希望巩固和发展同亚洲国家、首先是同各邻国的友好关系。中国的这一正确的政策，最近再一次体现在中国同缅甸和尼泊尔缔结的充满友好精神的条约和协定里。印度尼西亚华侨问题也开始得到解决。周恩来总理即将到印度进行访问并同尼赫鲁总理就中印边界问题进行谈判，这给人民带来希望，就是中印边界问题将可能获得妥善解决，亚洲最大的两个国家中国和印度的友好关系将会得到巩固。
    评论说，周恩来总理这次在一些亚洲国家进行的访问，进一步地显示了中国政府和人民真心诚意地希望进一步发展中国同亚洲各国的友好关系。这种友好关系是加强亚非团结力量以反对帝国主义、殖民主义的重要因素。所以亚洲人民都欢迎周恩来总理的这次访问。
    评论指出，只有帝国主义及其走狗才对周恩来总理的这次访问感到不安。这是因为，这一访问将给予妄图用一切手段来离间中国同亚非民族主义国家之间的关系的帝国主义者以当头一棒。
    评论又指出，帝国主义者仍然会千方百计破坏中国和亚非各国为发展国际和平和友谊所作出的努力。但是，它们必定会遭到更惨重的失败。
