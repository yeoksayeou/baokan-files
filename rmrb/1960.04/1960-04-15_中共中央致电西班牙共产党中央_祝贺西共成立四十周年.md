Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, congratulating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Spanish Communist Party. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party:

	On the occasion of the glorious 40th anniversary of the founding of the Spanish Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm fraternal congratulations to you, and through you, to all comrades of the Spanish Communist Party and the Spanish people.

	For the past forty years, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the Spanish Communist Party has undergone a glorious and arduous path, consistently leading the Spanish working class and the Spanish people in their struggle for democratic freedom, national independence, and social progress. We have followed with great admiration and sympathy the great and heroic struggle waged by the Spanish Communist Party during the civil war, leading and uniting the Spanish people to oppose Franco's fascist rebellion and defend the democratic republic. Due to the shameless intervention of imperialism, the cause of liberation of the Spanish people suffered a temporary setback. However, for twenty years, the Spanish Communist Party has maintained close ties with the masses of the people under extremely difficult conditions. The struggle of the Spanish people against Franco's rule has not only not been interrupted, but has also developed and expanded, putting the Franco regime in a serious crisis.

	At present, the international balance of power has further undergone tremendous changes favorable to peace and socialism. The true face of the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism—which is actively engaged in arms expansion and war preparations under the guise of peace, is also becoming increasingly clear to the people of all countries. With the support of the United States, the revival of West German militarism is a serious source of war danger in Europe and the world. The recent U.S.-instigated plot for West Germany to establish military bases in Spain is being resolutely opposed by the Spanish people and the people of all countries. We firmly support the Spanish people's struggle to end Franco's fascist rule, restore democracy, and oppose foreign military bases in Spain to safeguard national independence.

	We are deeply convinced that the cause of the liberation of the Spanish people, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, headed

    中共中央致电西班牙共产党中央
    祝贺西共成立四十周年
    新华社14日讯　中国共产党中央委员会打电报给西班牙共产党中央委员会，祝贺西班牙共产党建党四十周年纪念。贺电全文如下：西班牙共产党中央委员会：
    值此光荣的西班牙共产党成立四十周年之际，中国共产党中央委员会谨向你们、并通过你们向西班牙共产党全体同志和西班牙人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    四十年来，西班牙共产党在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，经历了光荣的和艰苦曲折的道路，坚持不懈地领导着西班牙工人阶级和西班牙人民为争取民主自由、民族独立和社会进步而斗争。我们曾以十分敬佩和同情的心情关注过西班牙共产党在国内战争时期，领导和团结西班牙人民为反对佛朗哥的法西斯叛乱、保卫民主共和国所进行的伟大而英勇的斗争。由于帝国主义的无耻干涉，西班牙人民的解放事业遭到暂时的挫折。但是，二十年来，西班牙共产党在极为困难的条件下，一直保持着和人民群众的密切联系，西班牙人民反对佛朗哥统治的斗争，不但没有中断过，并且日益发展和扩大，使佛朗哥政权面临严重的危机。
    目前国际力量对比，已经进一步发生了有利于和平和社会主义的巨大变化。全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义在玩弄和平手法掩盖下，积极进行扩军备战的真面目，也日益清楚地为各国人民所认识。在美国扶持下，西德军国主义的复活，是欧洲和世界的一个严重战争危险的策源地。最近美国策动西德在西班牙建立军事基地的阴谋，正遭到西班牙人民和各国人民的坚决反对。我们坚决支持西班牙人民为结束佛朗哥的法西斯统治、复兴民主，为反对外国在西班牙建立军事基地维护祖国独立的斗争。
    我们深信，西班牙人民的解放事业在以多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽同志为首的西班牙共产党中央委员会的领导下，一定能够取得最后胜利。
          中国共产党中央委员会　1960年4月10日
