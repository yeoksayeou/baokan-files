Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 15th: The Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference passed a resolution on the unity and solidarity of the Afro-Asian people in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism. The resolution stated that the conference congratulated the people of all countries on the great victories they have achieved in the struggle for the final elimination of imperialism and colonialism, and paid tribute to the countries that have gained independence in recent years and will gain independence in 1960.

The resolution said that imperialism has been defeated in every corner of the world, and nothing can save it from its inevitable demise.

The resolution pointed out that in the struggle against imperialism, the unity and solidarity of the Afro-Asian people occupy an extremely important and indispensable position. It is this unity and solidarity of the Afro-Asian people that has repeatedly struck blows at imperialism, thereby helping to smash the chains on the enslaved people of all countries and enabling each country to have the strength to resist imperialist violence, domination, conspiracies, and interference.

The resolution said that imperialism, feeling desperate due to its defeats and panicking about the imminent end, is resorting to the most brutal and malicious means to suppress the forces striving for liberation and independence. Imperialists—the imperialists of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain—aware of the strength of the unity of the Afro-Asian people and the strength manifested in the solidarity movement, are doing everything possible to undermine this great unity, thereby weakening the consolidation of this most powerful anti-imperialist front. The resolution said that the conference called on the Afro-Asian people to be vigilant against the imperialists' struggles to weaken this unity in order to continue to enforce their rule.

The resolution said that the conference demanded the immediate cessation of all imperialist conspiracies, the abolition of military bases and military treaties, and the withdrawal of all foreign imperialist troops and all imperialist military delegations from Asia and Africa.

The resolution said that it called for further consolidation of the unity and solidarity of the Afro-Asian people in the struggle with imperialism and colonialism; further consolidation of the national unity of all anti-imperialist forces in each country, and strengthening of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Movement in each country of Asia and Africa, so that it would rapidly develop and become a mass action movement with as many people participating as possible.

The resolution said that the conference called for the following measures to further consolidate Afro-Asian solidarity: continuing to organize material, moral, political, and economic support for the Afro-Asian people's struggle for national independence, providing education and health facilities in independent countries, providing refuge and assistance to refugees oppressed by imperialism, and morally and materially supporting all liberation movements, especially those engaged in liberation struggles such as in Algeria. The resolution called for immediate measures to improve transportation between Afro-Asian countries; mutual exchange of experts, writers, teachers, artists, journalists, workers, and other people; and economic cooperation between various mass organizations.

The conference also passed a resolution on imperialism. The resolution stated that the conference declared that the provision of weapons, military experts, and financial assistance by imperialist countries to countries engaged in colonialist wars of conquest is a direct aggression against the people of all Afro-Asian countries and a threat to world peace. The conference urged those countries that have not yet provided effective support for the national liberation struggle to make selfless contributions to the liberation struggle of the people of Afro-Asian countries.

The resolution said that the conference condemned to the world the crimes committed by imperialist countries, the shameless repression, and genocide, and condemned the imperialist countries for using all means to oppose the national liberation movements of the Afro-Asian people. The conference believes that the people of a country cannot be truly independent in the following circumstances: when actions are taken in its name without the full consent of the country; when foreign troops are stationed on its territory and occupy military bases there; and when the country is a member of an organization controlled by colonial countries or participates in military treaties with imperialist countries; and when the country does not possess the functions given to it by national sovereignty in political, military, economic, and social aspects, and the basic freedoms stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not respected.

The resolution said that the conference condemned the imperialists' policies of division and disintegration, and urgently appealed to the people of Afro-Asian countries to heighten their vigilance to frustrate these malicious conspiracies. The conference pointed out that the will of the Afro-Asian people is to immediately restore independence and national sovereignty, while this does not exclude equality between the people of various countries and between various countries.

The resolution said that the conference strongly condemned all colonialist practices, no matter what form they take, which are aimed at carrying out colonialist and imperialist oppression.

The resolution said that the conference called on all Afro-Asian countries to give unreserved moral and material support to the Afro-Asian people who are fighting for freedom and independence.

The resolution said that therefore, a conference should be convened as soon as possible to unite all vital forces in Asia and Africa, such as various political organizations, trade union organizations, women's organizations, youth movement organizations, academic organizations, etc., around the heads of state of Afro-Asian countries. The tasks of the conference are: first, to establish a common front for Afro-Asian liberation, so as to exchange experiences and provide the greatest support to the people and victims in the struggle; second, to establish an information dissemination organization; third, to establish an Afro-Asian volunteer corps under appropriate conditions to support the people of Afro-Asian countries; fourth, to establish a mutual aid fund organization aimed at assisting the people of Afro-Asian countries.

The resolution said that the conference condemned those puppet governments that prevent and obstruct the masses of the people from expressing their irrepressible will to realize and consolidate true independence.

The resolution said that the conference condemned the so-called "Security Treaty" concluded between Japan and the United States, which aims to revive Japanese militarism and establish nuclear bases on Japanese soil, thereby threatening the peace and security of countries in Asia and the Pacific region.

    亚非人民团结大会通过决议
    号召进一步巩固亚非人民团结
    警惕帝国主义的分裂和侵略阴谋
    据新华社科纳里克15日电　第二届亚非人民团结大会通过关于亚非各国人民在反对殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争中统一和团结的决议。决议说，大会对各国人民在争取最后消灭帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中日益取得的巨大胜利表示祝贺，并向近几年来获得独立和将在1960年获得独立的国家致敬。
    决议说，帝国主义在世界上每一个角落都遭到失败，没有任何东西能把它从不可避免的灭亡中拯救出来。
    决议指出，在反对帝国主义的斗争中，亚非各国人民的统一和团结，占着极其重要的不可或缺的地位。正是亚非各国人民的这种统一和团结，一次又一次地打击了帝国主义，从而有助于粉碎加在被奴役的各国人民身上的锁链，使每一个国家拥有力量来抵抗帝国主义的暴力、统治、阴谋诡计和干涉。
    决议说，帝国主义由于遭受失败而感到绝望，对于末日的即将来临感到惊惶失措，所以，正在借助于最残暴和恶毒的手段来抑止争取解放和独立的力量。帝国主义者——美国、英国、法国、西德、比利时、葡萄牙和西班牙的帝国主义者——意识到亚非人民的统一的力量以及表现在团结运动中的力量，正千方百计地试图破坏这种伟大的统一，从而削弱这种最有力量的反帝阵线的巩固。决议说，大会要求亚非各国人民警惕帝国主义者企图削弱这种统一以继续强行他们的统治而进行的挣扎。
    决议说，大会要求立即制止帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，废除军事基地和军事条约，从亚洲和非洲撤出一切外国帝国主义的军队和一切帝国主义军事代表团。
    决议说，大会要求进一步巩固亚非人民在同帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中的统一和团结；进一步巩固每一个国家的一切反对帝国主义力量的民族团结，并加强亚非两洲每一个国家的亚非人民团结运动，使它迅速发展，成为一个有尽可能多的群众参加的群众行动的运动。
    决议说，大会号召采取下列措施进一步巩固亚非的团结：继续组织在物质上、道义上、政治上和经济上支持亚非人民争取民族独立的斗争，在独立国家提供教育和卫生设施，给予受帝国主义镇压的难民以避难和援助，在道义上和物质上支持所有的解放运动，特别是支持像在阿尔及利亚那样从事于解放斗争的人们。决议要求立即采取措施来改善亚非国家之间的交通；互派专家、作者、教师、艺术家、记者、工人和其它的人；各个群众团体之间进行经济合作。
    大会还通过关于帝国主义的决议。决议说，大会宣布，帝国主义国家给予从事殖民主义征服战争的国家以武器、军事专家和财政援助，是对所有亚非国家的人民的直接侵略，是对世界和平的威胁。大会促请还没有对民族解放斗争提供有效的支持的那些国家，对亚非国家人民的解放斗争作出无私的贡献。
    决议说，大会向全世界谴责帝国主义国家所犯下的罪行、所进行的无耻镇压以及种族屠杀，谴责帝国主义国家用尽一切办法来反对亚非国家人民的民族解放运动。大会认为，一个国家的人民在下列情况下是不能真正独立的，那就是：没有得到这个国家的完全同意而以它的名义采取行动；外国军队驻扎在它的领土上，并在那里占领着军事基地；而这个国家又是为殖民国家所控制的机构的成员国或者同帝国主义国家一道参加军事条约；这个国家在政治、军事、经济和社会方面又不拥有国家主权所给予它的职能，而且世界人权宣言所规定的基本自由也得不到尊重。
    决议说，大会谴责帝国主义者的分裂和分化政策，并迫切呼吁亚非各国人民提高警惕来挫败这些恶毒的阴谋。大会指出，亚非各国人民的意愿，是要立即恢复独立和民族主权，同时这并不排除各国人民和各个国家之间的平等。
    决议说，大会强烈谴责一切殖民主义的做法，不管它们采取怎样的方式，这些做法都是为了进行殖民主义和帝国主义的压迫。
    决议说，大会要求亚非所有国家无保留地给予正在为自由和独立而斗争的亚非各国人民以道义上和物质上的支援。
    决议说，因此应及早召开一次把亚非一切有生力量如各个政治组织、工会组织、妇女组织、青年运动组织、学术界组织等团结在亚非各国国家首脑周围的大会。大会的任务是：第一，建立一个亚非争取解放的共同阵线，以便能交流经验和给予在斗争中的各国人民和受害者以最大的支援；第二，建立一个传播情报的机构；第三，在适当的条件下建立一支亚非志愿军团，以支援亚非各国人民；第四，建立目的在于援助亚非各国人民的互助基金组织。
    决议说，大会谴责那些傀儡政府，它们制止和阻挠人民群众表达争取实现和巩固真正独立的不可抑制的意志。
    决议说，大会谴责日美两国缔结的所谓“安全条约”，这个条约的目的是要复活日本军国主义和在日本的土地上建立核基地，从而威胁亚洲和太平洋地区各国的和平和安全。
