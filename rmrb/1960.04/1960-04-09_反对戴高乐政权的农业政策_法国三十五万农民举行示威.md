    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 7th: Thirty-five million farmers in more than twenty French towns held large-scale demonstrations today in opposition to the De Gaulle regime's agricultural policies that harm the interests of farmers.
    In Lille, Nancy, Nantes, Avignon, Strasbourg, Sens, Tours, and other places, tens of thousands of farmers held rallies and demonstrations. Speakers at the meetings and demonstrators angrily pointed out that De Gaulle's agricultural policies put French farmers in dire straits, with farmers working hard but unable to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
    In Sens, about sixty miles southeast of Paris, local authorities dispatched police to suppress the demonstrators. Police threw dozens of tear gas canisters at the more than ten thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the Sens local government building and beat them with batons, while the demonstrators defended themselves with stones. In Quimper, Brittany, police also clashed with demonstrators.
    In Tours, more than nine thousand people held rallies, and more than five thousand people marched with slogans opposing the government's agricultural policies.
    The French working class supports the farmers' struggle. Representatives of the local organizations of the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, and the "Workers' Force" General Confederation of Labor, and representatives of the farmers issued a joint statement in Nantes on the 6th, emphasizing the common interests of all working people in France and the necessity of unity in the struggle for their immediate rights. The statement called on the government to change its economic policies, particularly to reduce non-productive expenditures, in order to meet the demands of the working people.

    反对戴高乐政权的农业政策
    法国三十五万农民举行示威
    据新华社巴黎7日电　法国二十多个城镇的三十五万农民今天举行大示威，反对戴高乐政权损害农民利益的农业政策。
    在里尔、南锡、南特、阿维尼翁、斯特拉斯堡、桑斯和图尔等地，成千成万的农民举行集会和示威游行。在会上发言的人和示威者忿怒地指出，戴高乐的农业政策使法国农民频于窘境，农民在辛勤劳动，但不能享有应有的果实。
    在巴黎东南约六十英里的桑斯，地方当局出动警察镇压示威者。警察向聚集在桑斯地方政府门前的一万多名示威者投掷了数十个催泪弹，并且用警棍殴打他们，而示威者则用石块自卫。在布列塔尼的坎佩尔，警察也同示威者发生了冲突。
    在图尔，有九千多人举行集会，五千多人拿着反对政府的农业政策的标语游行。
    法国工人阶级支持农民的斗争。法国总工会、法国天主教工人联合会和“工人力量”总工会的地方组织的代表们和农民的代表6日在南特发表了一项联合声明，强调指出法国全体劳动人民利益的共同性和在争取切身权利的斗争中团结一致的必要性。声明要求政府改变经济政策，特别是减少非生产性开支，以便满足劳动人民的要求。
