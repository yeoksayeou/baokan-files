Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 15th: The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, at its closing meeting today, passed a Conference Declaration. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

The people of Asian and African countries, who have sent representatives to gather here to participate in the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry from April 11th to 15th, declare that we firmly believe in the moral and spiritual strength generated by our solidarity, and declare our determination to continue unremittingly to fight for our national independence.

No conspiracy or trickery of imperialism can undermine the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples in their struggle for national independence, freedom and progress.

At this important moment in world history, we declare our unwavering determination to play an active and decisive role in determining the destiny of this world, in which we constitute the vast majority, to advance mankind along the broad road of independence, freedom, prosperity and peace, and to stop colonialism and imperialism, which cause injustice, poverty and destruction.

The Asian and African peoples have chosen the path to achieve the above goals, and this path is clear. The first step forward along this path is to achieve national independence. We are determined to destroy all obstacles on this road to freedom, and we are determined to ensure that we never return to the times of the past.

The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference therefore reaffirms its adherence to the great spirit of the Bandung Conference, and reaffirms the ten principles of the Bandung Conference as follows:

I. Respect for fundamental human rights and for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

II. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.

III. Recognition of the equality of all races and of the equality of all nations large and small.

IV. Non-interference or intervention in the internal affairs of another country.

V. Respect for the right of each nation to defend itself singly or collectively, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.

VI. (a) Abstention from the use of arrangements of collective defence to serve the particular interests of any of the big powers; (b) Abstention by any country from exerting pressure on other countries.

VII. Refrain from acts or threats of aggression or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country.

VIII. Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means, such as negotiation, conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement as well as other peaceful means of their own choice, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.

IX.  Promotion of mutual interests and co-operation.

X. Respect for justice and international obligations.

We extend the hand of friendship to all people. However, long and painful experience has taught us the lesson: to distinguish between friends and enemies.

We, the Asian and African peoples, declare that we will never allow our national independence to be used as a bargaining chip. The heroic resistance of the Algerian people is the most eloquent example of this.

National independence means the fullest control over our own rich resources and potential, and the end of exploitation by foreigners and a handful of monopolists. It means the end of colonialism's rule over the Asian and African peoples, the end of suffering, discrimination and poverty, and the beginning of an era of equality for all.

Our struggle for independence and prosperity is also a struggle for world peace. The Asian and African peoples, standing as a strong force for peace, will do everything in our power and resources to fight against military treaties and alliances, against all other attempts to destroy, through nuclear holocaust, all that human wisdom has created for the happiness and prosperity of all peoples.

We have confidence in the future of mankind. We have confidence in the intelligence of mankind. We firmly believe that despite all the obstacles, the great era of peace and progress for mankind will dawn.

In the process of striving to achieve this new era of universal brotherhood and peace, the unity of the Asian and African peoples in the struggle against imperialism and for the establishment of a new world will play an increasingly decisive role.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 15th: The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference passed a series of resolutions on Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Laos, Okinawa, and Yemen.

The conference's resolution on Korea supports the Korean people's demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the realization of national reunification through peaceful means on a democratic basis. The conference decided that June 25th of this year, the tenth anniversary of the U.S. imperialists' instigation of the war of aggression in Korea, will be "Common Struggle Day to Promote the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from South Korea."

The conference's resolution on Vietnam demands the cessation of U.S. imperialist interference in South Vietnam, the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. military mission from South Vietnam, and the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords in order to reunify Vietnam on an independent and democratic basis.

The conference's resolution on Laos demands the cessation of U.S. interference in Laos' internal affairs, the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos, and the resumption of the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

The conference's resolution on Mongolia demands that the United Nations Security Council, at the next session of the United Nations General Assembly, pass the recommendation to admit the Mongolian People's Republic.

The conference's resolution on Okinawa expresses full support for the struggle of the Japanese people to recover Okinawa, an inseparable part of Japan, which has been turned into a nuclear weapons and rocket base by U.S. imperialism.

The conference's resolution on Yemen condemns the British occupation and division of southern Yemen, and demands the immediate withdrawal of British troops and the realization of the territorial integrity of Yemen. The conference also calls on the Asian and African peoples to provide effective assistance to all freedom fighters in southern Yemen.

    第二届亚非人民团结大会通过宣言
    亚非人民要决定自己的命运
    大会决议支持朝鲜越南人民争取祖国统一斗争
    新华社科纳克里15日电　第二届亚非人民团结大会在今天的闭幕会议上，通过了一项大会宣言。宣言全文如下：
    派遣代表聚集在这里参加4月11日到15日在科纳克里召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会的亚非各国人民宣告，我们坚信我们的团结所产生的道义和精神力量，并且宣布我们决心继续不懈地为我们的民族独立而斗争。
    帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计都不能破坏亚非各国人民在争取民族独立、自由和进步的斗争中的团结。
    在世界历史的这个重要时刻，我们宣布我们毫不动摇地决心要起积极的和决定性的作用，来决定我们占绝大多数的这个世界的命运，使人类沿着独立、自由、繁荣和和平的康庄大道前进，制止造成不义、贫困和毁灭的殖民主义和帝国主义。
    亚非各国人民已经选择了实现上述目标的道路，这条道路是明确的。顺着这条道路前进的第一步是取得民族独立。我们决心摧毁这条自由道路上的一切障碍，并且决心确保永远再不回到过去的时代。
    第二届亚非人民团结大会因此重申，它恪守万隆会议的伟大精神，并重申万隆会议的十项原则如下：
    一、尊重基本人权、尊重联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。
    二、尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整。
    三、承认一切种族的平等、承认一切大小国家的平等。
    四、不干预或干涉他国内政。
    五、尊重每一国家按照联合国宪章单独地或集体地进行自卫的权利。
    六、（子）不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务；（丑）任何国家不对其他国家施加压力。
    七、不以侵略行为或侵略威胁或使用武力来侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立。
    八、按照联合国宪章，通过如谈判、调停、仲裁或司法解决等和平方法以及有关方面自己选择的任何其他和平方法来解决一切国际争端。
    九、促进相互的利益和合作。
    十、尊重正义和国际义务。
    我们向所有的人伸出友谊之手。但是，长期惨痛的经验给我们的教训是：要分清朋友和敌人。
    我们亚非各国人民宣告，我们无论如何决不允许拿我们的民族独立作为讨价还价的东西。关于这一点，阿尔及利亚人民的英勇抵抗，是最雄辩的例证。
    民族独立意味着要最完全地掌握我们自己的丰富资源和潜力，并结束外国人和一小撮垄断资本家的剥削。这意味着结束殖民主义对亚非各国人民的统治，结束苦痛、歧视和贫困，并且开始一切人平等的时期。
    我们争取独立和繁荣的斗争，同时就是争取世界和平的斗争。作为一支争取和平的坚强力量站立起来了的亚非各国人民，将竭尽我们的力量和资源，为反对军事条约和联盟、反对其它一切旨在通过核能大屠杀来毁灭人类智慧为各国人民的幸福和繁荣所创造的一切的企图而斗争。
    我们对人类的前途有信心。我们对人类的聪明才智有信心。我们深信，尽管还有种种障碍，人类的和平和进步的伟大时代将要破晓。
    在争取实现这个普世亲如兄弟的和平的新时代的过程中，亚非各国人民在反对帝国主义和争取建立新世界的斗争中的团结一致，将日益起决定性的作用。
    据新华社科纳克里15日电　第二届亚非人民团结大会就朝鲜、越南、蒙古、老挝、冲绳岛和也门通过了一系列决议。
    大会关于朝鲜的决议支持朝鲜人民关于迫使美国军队撤出南朝鲜并在民主基础上通过和平办法实现国家统一的要求。大会决定今年6月25日，美国帝国主义在朝鲜挑起侵略战争十周年的日子，为“促使美军撤出南朝鲜共同斗争日”。
    大会关于越南的决议要求制止美帝国主义在南越进行的干涉，美国军事代表团立即从南越撤退，正确执行日内瓦协议，以便在独立和民主的基础上重新统一越南。
    大会关于老挝的决议要求制止美国干涉老挝的内政，正确地执行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。
    大会关于蒙古的决议要求联合国安全理事会在联合国组织下届大会举行时通过接纳蒙古人民共和国的建议。
    大会关于冲绳岛的决议表示充分支持日本人民为收复被美帝国主义变为核武器和火箭基地的日本不可分割的一部分冲绳岛而进行的斗争。
