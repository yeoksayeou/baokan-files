Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th -- Party committee secretaries at all levels in Henan Province are leading the broad masses in adopting emergency measures of "camping in the fields, setting up defenses block by block" to be ready at any time to combat frost damage and ensure that wheat safely passes through the jointing stage.

The more than 80 million mu of summer harvest crops in Henan Province are generally growing well. Wheat is generally about a foot high and is in the jointing stage. Every year in mid-April, frost often occurs. In recent days, a strong cold air mass moving south from Siberia has been invading the province, and the weather has changed dramatically. According to weather forecasts, frost is expected to occur throughout the province in the next two days. To this end, the Henan Provincial Party Committee issued an emergency frost prevention instruction on the evening of the 9th, requiring party committees at all levels to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, use the rich experience accumulated over the years in preventing frost and overcoming frost damage, and quickly launch a mass movement to overcome natural disasters such as frost and wind. Local party committees, city committees, and county committees have also held emergency meetings to make specific arrangements.

At present, the labor force participating in frost prevention throughout the province has reached more than 10 million people, including more than 900,000 cadres above the commune level. From the province to the people's communes, frost prevention headquarters or frost prevention groups have been established, working day and night. All localities regard overcoming frost as the most urgent task at present. Hou Songlin, secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee Secretariat, and five members of the Prefectural Party Committee, recently went to the front line of frost prevention to personally inspect frost prevention equipment. According to incomplete statistics from only eight counties and cities, frost prevention equipment that has been made can control an area of more than 1 million mu. On the evening of the 9th, various counties and cities in the Kaifeng Special Zone transferred more than 26,000 cadres and school teachers and students to the countryside overnight to help commune members prepare for frost prevention. At present, more than 50,000 frost prevention cannons have been rushed to be manufactured throughout the special zone. All production teams have established field frost prevention stations, taking turns on duty throughout the night. As soon as the frost signal sounds, the entire area can act simultaneously. Mì County, Dēngfēng County, Gǒng County, and other five counties have prepared more than 2.67 million frost prevention platforms, frost prevention kilns, and frost prevention cannons, as well as more than 100 million catties of firewood for smoke for frost prevention. Xǔchāng and Nányáng Special Zones have also successively successfully trial-produced artificial fog and rocket-type universal powder sprayers. According to experiments, each artificial fog tube can prevent 10 to 15 mu.

While building a large number of frost prevention equipment, localities are also actively applying nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers to wheat fields and watering wheat fields with insufficient water content to increase frost resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th -- People's communes in various parts of Shaanxi Province are actively carrying out preparations for frost prevention based on the recent drop in temperature, erratic changes, and the ease of frost damage. As of the 9th, the province had dug 8.69 million frost prevention pits in summer harvest crop fields, built more than 2.6 million frost prevention towers, and prepared 278.95 million catties of firewood. Relevant departments and communes in Pucheng, Zhouzhi, Xianyang and other counties and cities have assigned special personnel to take turns on duty, enhancing frost prevention measures. Many places have also reorganized frost prevention professional teams, set up positions, and prepared to fight frost. In areas where temperatures dropped significantly on the evening of the 11th, fire prevention was carried out in a timely manner. Wangzhuang Commune in Hánchéng County dispatched more than 9,200 people, spread ash over 119,000 mu, irrigated 1,007 mu, used 347,000 catties of firewood, and lit more than 38,500 piles of fire to prevent spring frost damage.

All parts of the province have also strengthened meteorological forecasting and forecasting work based on the long duration of temperature drops this year. At present, production teams in various communes have established and improved meteorological groups. Tongchuan, Hancheng, and other counties and cities have trained a large number of meteorological observers and equipped them with a large number of thermometers. Weinan County has set up five observation points in different areas, and each observation point reports temperature changes to the county's frost prevention headquarters every half hour.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th -- Since April 10th, the temperature has been low in Xúzhōu, Huai'an, Yánchéng and other places in northern Jiangsu. The party committees in these areas have taken timely and effective measures to prevent possible frost damage. The party secretaries took the lead in establishing cold prevention organizations. Kilns are commonly dug in wheat fields to burn smoke, or sprayers are used to spray water to protect seedlings. Wind fences have been built around early rice seedling beds, and methods such as covering with straw curtains and deep watering have been used to protect seedlings. Necessary cold protection measures have also been taken for sweet potato warm bed seedlings. Fùníng, Jiànhú, Dōngtái, Dàfēng and other counties have applied warm fertilizers to seedlings. These areas have transferred more than 3,600 county and commune cadres to various production teams to strengthen the leadership of cold and frost prevention work.

    河南陕西紧急动员迎战霜害
    苏北连日气温较低，各地普建防寒组织预防霜冻
    新华社郑州13日电　河南省各级党委书记带领广大群众采取“田间扎营、块块设防”的紧急措施，随时准备迎击霜冻灾害，确保小麦安全度过拔节关。
    河南省八千多万亩夏收作物普遍生长良好，小麦一般都长得一尺左右高，正处在拔节期间。历年每当4月中旬，往往发生霜冻。连日来，从西伯利亚南下的冷强空气正侵袭全省，天气骤然巨变。根据气象预报，预计在最近两天全省将有霜冻出现。为此，中共河南省委在9日晚发出了紧急防霜指示，要求各级党委充分发挥人民公社的优越性，运用历年来防霜和战胜霜害的丰富经验，迅速掀起一个全民的战胜霜、风等自然灾害的突击运动。各地委、市委、县委也都召开了紧急会议，作了具体部署。
    目前，全省参加防霜队伍的劳力已达一千多万人，其中公社以上的干部有九十多万人。从省到人民公社都建立了防霜指挥部或防霜小组，通宵达旦办公。各地都把战胜霜冻作为当前最紧迫的任务。中共新乡地委书记处书记侯松林和五名地委委员，最近分赴防霜第一线，亲自检查防霜设备。检查结果，仅据八个县、市的不完全统计，已经做好的防霜器械可控制面积一百多万亩。开封专区各县、市在9日晚抽调干部和学校师生二万六千多人，星夜下乡，帮助社员做好防霜准备工作。目前全专区已赶制防霜炮五万多个。各生产队都建立了田头防霜台，通夜轮流值班，只要霜冻信号一鸣，全区就可同时行动。密县、登封、巩县等五个县，已经备好防霜台、防霜窑、防霜炮等二百六十七万多个，防霜用熏烟柴草一亿多斤。许昌、南阳等专区还先后试制成功人造雾、火箭式万能喷粉器。据试验，每一个人造雾筒可以预防十亩到十五亩。
    在大建大造防霜设备的同时，各地还积极向麦田追施氮磷钾肥，给含水量不足的麦田浇水，以增加抗霜能力。
    新华社西安13日电　陕西各地人民公社根据最近气温下降、变化无常容易发生霜冻的情况，积极开展防霜冻的准备工作。到9日止，全省已在夏收作物田头挖了防霜坑八百六十九万个，筑好防霜塔二百六十多万个，备柴二亿七千八百九十五万斤。蒲城、盩厔、咸阳等县市的有关部门和公社都设有专人轮流值班，增强了防霜措施。不少地方还重新组织了防霜专业组，摆开阵势，准备迎击霜冻。11日晚气温显著下降的地区，都及时进行了点火预防。韩城县王庄公社出动了九千二百多人，撒灰十一万九千多亩，灌水一千零七亩，用柴草三十四万七千斤，点火三万八千五百多堆，防止了春霜为害。
    全省各地还根据今年气温下降持续时间长，加强了气象预测、预报工作。目前各公社的生产队都建立和健全了气象组。铜川、韩城等县市训练了大批气象观测员，配备了大量的温度计。渭南县全县分区设立了五个观测点，各观测点每半个小时向县防霜指挥部汇报一次气温变化情况。
    新华社南京13日电　江苏北部地区的徐州、淮阴、盐城等地，自4月10日以来气温较低，这些地区的党委都及时采取有效措施，预防可能出现的霜冻，由党委书记挂帅建立了防寒组织。麦田里普遍挖窑烧烟，或用喷雾器喷水护苗。早稻秧池周围筑起风笆，并且用加盖草帘子、灌深水等办法护苗。山芋温床育苗，也采取了必要的防寒措施。阜宁、建湖、东台、大丰等县为秧苗施了暖性肥料。这些地区已抽调三千六百多个县、社干部到各个生产队，加强防寒防冻的领导工作。
