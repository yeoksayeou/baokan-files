    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th – At a public trial held in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province on April 2nd, attended by over ten thousand people, current counter-revolutionaries Zhang Decai and Hui Shenwa, who poisoned and murdered sixty-one road-building workers, were sentenced to death and immediately executed.
    The truth about the food poisoning of sixty-one road-building workers in Pinglu County has come to light. This incident was the result of counter-revolutionary criminals Zhang Decai and Hui Shenwa conspiring to poison. Before liberation, Zhang Decai participated in reactionary landlord armed organizations such as the Japanese puppet security team, the Yan Xishan bandit's "Love the Hometown Corps," and the "Anti-Communist Revenge Corps," and also served as the deputy leader of an intelligence team and other reactionary positions. He successively arrested five people, including Li Huiwen, chairman of our farmers' association, and militiaman Zhang Yinwa, in villages such as Shengrenjian and Yangzhuang in Pinglu County, together with other counter-revolutionary bandits. In addition to personally torturing the arrested revolutionary masses, Zhang Decai, under the instruction of the Yan Xishan bandit's "Love the Hometown Corps," drowned Li Huiwen by placing him upside down in a water tank. Li Huiwen's wife also went mad and died as a result. After liberation, Zhang Decai concealed his historical crimes and continued to be hostile to the people, carrying out sabotage activities, and once raped a woman. The Pinglu County People's Court sentenced him to six months in prison. After serving his sentence, Zhang Decai infiltrated the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in September 1958. Soon, the factory discovered his historical crimes, and the Taiyuan Beicheng District People's Court sentenced him to three years of control and sent him back to Pinglu County for control and transformation. During the process of control and transformation, he repeatedly spread rumors and slandered the policy of unified purchase and sale, and attempted to incite the workers against the government. The workers held meetings to criticize his reactionary remarks. Counter-revolutionary element Hui Shenwa was of landlord background. After the land reform, Hui Shenwa harbored resentment and vowed to "take revenge." Last winter, he and Zhang Decai infiltrated the Fengnan Highway workers' team and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. In January of this year, Hui Shenwa brought privately hidden arsenic to the construction site, and taking advantage of the opportunity when Zhang Decai was criticized and hated the masses, he gave the arsenic to Zhang Decai, and the two secretly plotted to put the arsenic in the rice pot to poison the workers. On the afternoon of February 2nd, Zhang Decai secretly put the arsenic in the rice pot, poisoning sixty-one workers. Thanks to the Party and the government mobilizing all forces to rescue them in every possible way, especially the relevant units in Beijing, who demonstrated the spirit of communism by sending medicine from thousands of miles away, the sixty-one poisoned workers were cured. After the incident, with the assistance of local workers and the masses, the public security organs cracked the case on February 3rd.
    At the public trial on April 2nd, representatives of the sixty-one workers who had been poisoned and representatives of more than ten thousand people from all over Pinglu County angrily accused the counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Decai and Hui Shenwa of their crimes, and resolutely demanded that these two counter-revolutionary elements with numerous crimes be sentenced to death.
    Based on the criminal facts of the counter-revolutionary criminals Zhang Decai and Hui Shenwa and the demands of the masses, and with the approval of the Supreme People's Court, the Pinglu County People's Court sentenced them to death and immediately executed them.
    The sixty-one victims and all the masses present at the meeting unanimously supported the People's Court's death sentence for the counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Decai and Hui Shenwa, and expressed their gratitude to the Party and the government and the people of the capital for their efforts to rescue the sixty-one workers. They are determined to go all out and answer the concern of the Party and the people of the whole country with excellent production achievements. Guo Pengheng, the county head of Pinglu County, called on the people of the county at the meeting to learn from this incident and improve their revolutionary vigilance. He also called on the people of Pinglu County to continue to learn and carry forward the communist spirit of the people of the capital in the process of rescuing the sixty-one class brothers, and let the communist spirit take root, sprout, and bear fruitful results in every corner.

    六十一个阶级弟兄中毒事件真相大白
    放毒凶犯张德才、回申娃被处决
    新华社太原6日电　在山西省平陆县4月2日举行的有一万多人参加的公审大会上，放毒谋害六十一个筑路民工的现行反革命分子张德才、回申娃在会上被判处死刑，并立即执行。
    平陆县六十一个筑路民工食物中毒的真象已经大白。这一事件是反革命罪犯张德才、回申娃共谋投毒制造的。张德才在解放前曾参加过日伪保安队、阎匪“爱乡团”“反共复仇队”等反动地主武装组织，还担任过情报组副组长等反动职务，曾先后在平陆县圣人涧、杨庄等村，伙同其他反革命匪徒抓捕过我农会主席李会文和民兵张银娃等五人。张德才除亲自拷打被捕的革命群众外，还在阎匪“爱乡团”指使下，将李会文倒放在水缸里淹死。李会文的妻子也因此气疯而死。解放后，张德才隐瞒了历史罪恶，并继续与人民为敌，进行破坏活动，曾经强奸过妇女。平陆县人民法院曾判处他徒刑半年。刑满后，张德才又在1958年9月混入太原钢铁厂。不久工厂查出了他的历史罪行，太原北城区人民法院将他判处管制三年，解回平陆县管制改造。在管制改造过程中，他多次造谣污蔑统购统销政策，并且企图煽动民工反对政府。民工们曾开会批判他的反动言行。反革命分子回申娃，地主成分。土地改革后，回申娃怀恨在心，声言要“报仇”。去年冬天他和张德才一起混入风南公路民工队后，继续进行反革命活动。今年1月回申娃将私藏的砒霜带到工地，乘张德才受到批判后仇恨群众的机会，把砒霜交给张德才，两人密谋要把砒霜放在饭锅里毒害民工。2月2日下午，张德才把砒霜偷偷放在饭锅里，使六十一个民工中毒。由于党和政府动员各方面的力量多方抢救，特别是北京有关单位发扬共产主义的精神，千里送药，多方抢救，这六十一位中毒的民工才得以治愈。事情发生后，在当地民工和群众的协助下，公安机关在2月3日就破获了这个案件。
    在4月2日的公审大会上，曾经受毒害的六十一个民工的代表和来自平陆县各地的一万多名群众的代表们，愤怒地控诉了反革命分子张德才、回申娃的罪行，坚决要求将这两个罪行累累的反革命分子判处死刑。
    平陆县人民法院根据反革命犯张德才、回申娃两人的罪恶事实和群众的要求，并经最高人民法院核准，将他们判处死刑立即执行。
    六十一个受害民工和与会的全体群众对人民法院将反革命分子张德才和回申娃判处死刑一致拥护，对党和政府及首都人民千方百计地抢救六十一个民工表示万分感激。他们决心要鼓足干劲，以优异的生产成绩来回答党和全国人民的关怀。平陆县县长郭蓬恒在大会上号召全县人民要从这一事件中吸取教训，提高革命警惕性。他还号召平陆县人民要继续学习和发扬首都人民在抢救六十一个阶级兄弟的过程中的共产主义风格，让共产主义精神在各个角落生根发芽，结出丰硕的果实。
