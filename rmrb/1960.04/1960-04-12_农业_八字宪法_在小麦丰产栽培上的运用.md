Comrade Representatives:

I fully agree with and support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. I would now like to express some opinions on wheat production.

I. The Great Development of Wheat Production in Our Country Since Liberation

Wheat is the most important food crop in our country after rice. It is distributed throughout the country, with a cultivated area of more than 400 million mu. Most areas can plant in the autumn and harvest in the summer, called winter wheat, which is most suitable for intercropping with spring and summer crops such as rice, cotton, and miscellaneous grains. The main winter wheat producing areas are Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and other provinces. In severely cold winter areas, it is cultivated as spring wheat, mainly distributed in Heilongjiang, Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions.

Wheat cultivation in our country has a long history. Preliminary research shows that it was planted more than 4,000 years ago. Hardworking farmers have accumulated rich experience in wheat cultivation. However, before liberation, due to the long-term cruel exploitation and oppression by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, farmers were in low spirits and lacked the production conditions and tools to resist diseases, pests and natural disasters. The level of wheat production was extremely low, with an average yield of only 86 jin per mu when the country was liberated in 1949. Therefore, people regarded wheat as a low-yield crop. After liberation, through land reform and the agricultural cooperative movement, productivity was liberated, and enthusiasm was high. Based on this, the Party led the national farmers to carry out a series of reforms in agricultural technology, accumulating and producing fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, mass seed selection, promoting close planting, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Wheat production rose sharply, and by 1953, it had recovered to the highest level before the war, and by 1957, it had increased by 30% compared with 1953.

In 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Building Socialism, farmers in various places launched a vigorous technical revolution in production. Across the country, wheat fields that were deeply ploughed to more than one chi accounted for two-thirds of the wheat planting area. Fertilizers were widely applied, the amount of sowing was increased, the quality of sowing was improved, improved varieties were promoted, old-fashioned farm tools were improved and new-style farm tools were used, and large-scale insect and disease prevention campaigns were launched. After overcoming the long-term drought of 100 days and varying degrees of disease and insect disasters in the main producing areas, wheat production achieved astonishing growth, an increase of 22.4% compared with 1957. It was during this great leap forward in agricultural production that Chairman Mao summarized the farmers' experience in increasing production and the experience of agricultural technology reform since liberation, and systematically put forward the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, pointing out the path for high-speed development of agricultural production and scientific research in our country .

In 1959, under the guidance of the three red banners of the General Line , the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture was implemented more comprehensively and meticulously. In wheat production, tens of thousands of large-area high-yield squares emerged, such as Yanshi and Mengxian in Henan, and Anguo in Hebei, which all had 10,000 mu squares with an average yield of more than 600 jin per mu. In Fumin County, Yunnan Province, 13,000 mu of wheat had an average yield of 521 jin per mu. Delingha Farm in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, a newly reclaimed area, had 13,000 mu of wheat fields with an average yield of 1,057 jin per mu; Xiangride Farm had 2,060 mu of wheat fields with an average yield of 1,100 jin per mu, creating unprecedented new records in large-area high yields. The total wheat output this year increased by 20.9% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958, equivalent to 253% of 1949, presenting a brilliant situation of continuous Great Leap Forward.

According to reports from various places, this year's wheat production, based on the experience of continuous leaps forward in the past two years, has further conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, grasping it early, grasping it well, managing it meticulously, and managing it comprehensively. Whether it is deep ploughing, fertilization, land preparation, sowing, irrigation, or management measures, there have been great improvements compared with last year, with a wide range, large quantity, good quality, and timely implementation, resulting in significant benefits. At present, the wheat fields in the north are returning to green and growing, and the wheat fields in the south have mostly jointed and are pregnant with ears. They are lush green and very vigorous. The growth of wheat seedlings is better than in the same period last year. Some relatively arid areas have overcome the initial drought damage by vigorously fighting drought and with recent welcomed rains. As long as fertilizer and water and management measures are followed up in time, they will soon catch up. The wheat in the subtropical regions is nearing maturity, and the dense and fertile ears of wheat sway in the wind, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. The masses in various places are full of energy and confidence, advancing victoriously and striving for excellence, vowing to win another bumper harvest of wheat this year and achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

II. The "Eight-Character Charter" Not Only Guaranteed the Rapid Improvement of Wheat Production Level, But Also Promoted the Continuous Development of High-Yield Cultivation Theory.

The practice of the two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 further proved that the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is a closely related and mutually promoting organic whole, not a simple and mechanical sum of eight characters. Each character plays a different role in the eight characters. Soil is the foundation, fertilizer, water, and seed are the prerequisites, density is the center, and protection, management, and tools are the guarantees. Every character is important, indispensable, and cannot be substituted for each other. Therefore, it is necessary to apply them comprehensively according to the time and place, and in combination with the growth and development characteristics of wheat, in order to fully exert the role of increasing production. In the past two years, as a result of the comprehensive application of the "Eight-Character Charter" according to local conditions under different conditions, unprecedented high-density, large-eared and multi-grain, non-lodging high-yield wheat fields have emerged, and wheat ears with as many as 150 grains have never been seen before. Many old concepts have been broken in wheat production measures, and a new high-yield cultivation theory has been created with close planting as the center and comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter," writing a brilliant page for wheat production and cultivation science in our country.

(1) Soil is the growing base of crops, ranking first in the Eight-Character Charter, and is the foundation of high-yield cultivation. To make crops grow well, there must be a deep and fertile soil layer, so that roots can be deep and leaves can be lush, and high yields can be obtained. Hardworking farmers in Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi have long had the experience of using deep ploughing to obtain high yields, but under the small-scale peasant economy of the feudal system, it could only be carried out on a very small area. Due to the simple farm tools and insufficient power, the vast wheat fields could not be deeply ploughed, forming a shallow ploughing phenomenon of "ploughing without three cun of soil." After liberation, especially during the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the Party led the masses to carry out deep ploughing on a large scale, and achieved great results.

Deep ploughing combined with the application of more organic fertilizer, so that soil and fertilizer are mixed and integrated, improves the physical, chemical and biological environment in the soil, can basically mature the deep soil layer within the year, create a fertile cultivated layer, and provide extremely favorable conditions for the growth of wheat roots. Maturing the soil in a short year is a revolution and a creation in soil science. It powerfully proves the theory that labor can create and can create fertile soil in a short period of time, and completely smashes the reactionary view of soil fertility decreasing held by bourgeois scholars, thereby better arming people with the strength to fight against nature. Practice has proved that appropriate deep ploughing, increased application of organic fertilizer, full mixing of soil and fertilizer, destruction of the hard plough bottom, appropriate increase in soil porosity, improvement of soil permeability and water storage, and corresponding increase in soil temperature and humidity are all conducive to the propagation and activity of aerobic bacteria, thereby accelerating the decomposition of soil nutrients and the absorption and utilization of roots.

In deep ploughing technology, under normal circumstances, the principle of turning the upper soil over and loosening the lower soil without disturbing the soil layer should be mastered. In addition to increasing the application of base fertilizer and applying fertilizer to the entire layer, it is also necessary to combine sunning the fallow land, warming the soil, watering thoroughly to retain moisture, preparing the land carefully, and doing a good job in preserving soil moisture, in order to achieve the desired results.

(2) Fertilizer The large-scale application of organic fertilizer is one of the characteristics of crop cultivation technology in our country. Farmers in our country have accumulated extremely rich experience in this regard. Organic fertilizers not only have various nutrients needed for crop growth, but also can mature the soil, improve soil structure, and facilitate plant absorption. Therefore, raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer and developing various possible sources of organic fertilizer are basic prerequisites for high-yield crop cultivation in our country. In recent years, wheat production practice and experimental research have clarified that organic fertilizer is used as base fertilizer, chemical fertilizer is used as seed fertilizer and topdressing, base fertilizer is the main fertilizer, topdressing is auxiliary, increase the application of base fertilizer, apply topdressing in stages, apply early tillering fertilizer when the base fertilizer is insufficient, and emphasize winter fertilizer in the south. In the north, apply early returning green and jointing fertilizer in combination with watering to improve fertilizer utilization. According to the preliminary analysis in the past two years, wheat with a yield of about 1,000 jin per mu absorbs about 24 jin of pure nitrogen, 14 jin of phosphoric acid, and 40 jin of potassium oxide. Under the current cultivation conditions, the fertilizer utilization rate of farmers' nitrogen fertilizer is about 25% to 50%, phosphorus fertilizer is about 25%, and potassium fertilizer is about 30%. That is, each mu needs to apply 48 to 96 jin of pure nitrogen, about 56 jin of phosphoric acid, and about 140 jin of potassium oxide, which is equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 jin of general coarse fertilizer. In soils with high fertility, in addition to applying nitrogen fertilizer, it is also necessary to increase the use of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to promote wheat to be strong and non-lodging. Wheat fields with insufficient fertility should vigorously promote the application of nitrogen fertilizer.

(3) Water Before liberation, more than 90% of the wheat in the main wheat-producing areas of our country was planted on non-irrigated dry land, so the harvest was very low and extremely unstable. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, water conservancy projects have been built on a large scale, and the irrigated area of wheat fields has greatly increased, laying a solid foundation for overall production increase. In terms of irrigation technology, based on the inherent experience of farmers in northern my country in watering according to the weather, land, and seedlings, and the experience of "three fertilizers and five waters," a method of multiple frequent watering with deep and shallow, timely and appropriate amounts has been developed: Deeply water to retain moisture before ploughing when the weather is dry, water thoroughly to consolidate the land after deep ploughing, water shallowly after emergence to avoid needle damage, water abundantly before wintering to protect against freezing, water a little later when returning green if the soil moisture is sufficient, water a little earlier when the soil moisture is poor, and water at the appropriate time and amount during jointing to promote growth. In addition, it is also necessary to decide whether to water during ear pregnancy, heading and flowering, grain filling, and wheat yellowing according to the rainfall situation, as well as the timing and amount of watering. In the south, there is often too much rain after the middle of wheat growth, so attention should be paid to drainage and prevention of waterlogging. In the past year or two, many areas have initially established a graded drainage system to ensure that ditches are connected, shallow to deep, crisscrossed, and drainage is smooth.

Whether in the south or the north, basic farmland construction and gardenification are being carried out on a large scale, with land as flat as a mirror, ridges as straight as lines, and ditches connected for both drainage and irrigation.

(4) Seed Selecting and cultivating good varieties under excellent conditions is the most economical and effective method to obtain high yields. At present, the wheat good varieties adopted in various places generally have good characteristics such as large ears and many grains, excellent quality, strong stalks, tight mouths, and strong disease resistance to varying degrees. Thanks to the Party's emphasis and correct leadership on the seed cause, the area of good varieties has rapidly expanded after liberation, and the quality of good varieties has gradually improved. Excellent farmer seed selectors and scientific research institutions and colleges at all levels have continuously created new and excellent varieties and delivered them to production and application one after another. At present, there are 277 wheat good varieties promoted and planted nationwide, accounting for 92% of the total wheat area, generally increasing production by 10% to 30%. These good varieties are constantly being replaced and updated. In order to ensure the supply of good varieties and maintain the excellent seed properties, people's communes in various places have begun to establish good seed breeding farms and seed professional teams to carry out wheat good seed breeding and seed selection work according to the central government's "four self-reliance and one auxiliary" policy (self-breeding, self-selecting, self-retaining, and self-use, supplemented by a small amount of adjustment). The experience of promoting good varieties in recent years has proved that under the favorable conditions of the people's communes, wheat good varieties should be reasonably allocated, and good varieties with different growth periods should be selected and planted according to the conditions of stubble, land fertility, terrain, labor and animal power, and machinery, in order to give full play to the yield increase potential of the varieties and avoid excessive tension during mature harvesting and natural disasters that may occur during the growth period. Since the Great Leap Forward, in the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, it has also been observed that with the improvement of fertilizer and water conditions and the development of reasonable close planting, new requirements have been put forward for the characteristics of wheat varieties: under the conditions of high fertilizer level and careful cultivation management, varieties with moderate tillering, medium-short plant height, hard and non-lodging stems, large ears and large grains, many and full grains, narrow early leaves, upright growth, and late sealing are most suitable for close planting and high-yield cultivation. The facts of the Great Leap Forward also broke the traditional concepts of variety productivity and adaptability in the past. As long as the coordination of various yield-increasing factors is improved, the yield-increasing potential of wheat varieties can be continuously improved, and the adaptation area can also be further expanded. This has a great enlightening effect on the rational layout of good varieties and the selection and breeding of new varieties.

(5) Density Before liberation, most wheat fields applied sparse planting, with wide rows and large ridges in the north, with row spacing mostly more than one chi, and point planting and broadcasting in the south. The sowing amount per mu was generally five to eight jin, and the number of ears per field was only about 100,000. The plants were short and the ears were small, and the yield was very low; only a few locations with sufficient fertilizer and water used a larger sowing amount to carry out wide-row strip planting to obtain higher yields. After liberation, with the improvement of production conditions, the Party led the masses to vigorously implement close planting measures according to local conditions. From advocating strip planting to changing the width of the sowing legs and appropriately increasing the sowing amount, to promoting narrow-row strip planting machines, by 1959, the close planting area of wheat had reached 80% of the wheat fields, and the sowing amount had been increased to 15 to 30 jin per mu for winter wheat and 25 to 50 jin for spring wheat, which had a significant effect on increasing wheat production.

Practice has proved that reasonable close planting is the central link to achieve increased plants, increased ears, increased grains, and increased production. Because more plants are planted on the same land area, it is possible to maximize the use of nutrients and water in the soil, carbon dioxide in the air, and solar energy for material metabolism, promote wheat plant growth, and thus obtain high yields. In the past two years, in the practice of continuous Great Leap Forward and comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter," reasonable close planting has had new developments in theory: (1) Reasonable close planting is the greatest development of the group. It is the center of all high-yield cultivation techniques that runs through from planting to harvesting, that is, the process of reasonably mastering the density dynamics from planting to seedlings, to tillering, to plants, to ears, to grains. It is not simply a matter of sowing amount and method. (2) In the correct arrangement of the relationship between individuals and groups, there must be sufficient wheat seedlings and green body area to fully utilize nutritional conditions and light energy, but it cannot be too dense to ensure good growth and development of single plants in the group. (3) The acquisition of high yields is achieved under the mutual coordination of many ears, large ears, and large grains. Under the current field cultivation conditions, if you want to achieve a sufficient number of ears, you must also start by appropriately increasing the sowing amount to ensure that there are enough main stem ears; and strong wheat will inevitably produce tillers. Therefore, relying on the main stem ears and striving for as many tiller ears as possible is the key to close planting and high-yield cultivation. (4) Reasonable close planting must be based on the needs of increased plants and increased ears for nutrition and light conditions, and select suitable good varieties according to local conditions and cooperate with corresponding cultivation measures. Conversely, different natural conditions must also apply different close planting methods. All measures that can promote root development in the seedling stage, tillering leaves, vigorous growth, avoid early sealing, good ventilation and light transmission before and after jointing, and robust and solid growth at the base of the stem are conducive to achieving close planting and increased production. In this regard, it is very necessary to adopt sowing methods corresponding to close planting according to local conditions. At present, some areas adopt wide-row strip planting close planting under the condition of high fertility level, with wheat width and row spacing of about four to six cun each, or the row spacing is slightly larger than the planting width, which has a certain effect on forming high yields.

The theory and method of reasonable close planting of wheat are still under continuous development. This year, scientific research institutions, colleges and universities, and people's communes across the country concentrated their efforts to attack the problem of close planting from different angles of various specialties. It is certain that they will make great contributions to further revealing and clarifying the objective law of reasonable close planting.

(6) Protection Before liberation, wheat in our country suffered from many insects and disasters, including serious underground pests, wheat midges, nematode diseases, three kinds of bunt diseases, scab diseases, and three kinds of rust diseases. This was one of the main reasons for the low and unstable wheat production. After liberation, the occurrence law and prevention methods of major diseases and insects were actively studied, various special pesticides were manufactured, native and foreign medicines and machinery and equipment and high-quality varieties with strong resistance to stress were promoted, and the forecasting and early warning system for disease and insect occurrence was strengthened. Nematode diseases and three kinds of bunt diseases have been basically eliminated, and the harm of underground pests and wheat midges has been basically controlled. The three kinds of rust diseases have also been further prevented and controlled, and many good varieties resistant to rust diseases have been widely planted in production. These situations have enabled us to win the absolute initiative in controlling the occurrence of wheat diseases and insects, thereby ensuring high yields and bumper harvests of wheat. However, the reproduction rate of diseases and insects is extremely high, and the variability of pathogens is large. We must always be vigilant in the fight against diseases and insects and do a good job in prevention first and early eradication.

(7) Management Management is the embodiment of the comprehensive use of the "Eight-Character Charter." It is based on the natural conditions of the region and the characteristics of wheat plant growth and development. On the basis of fully utilizing the yield-increasing effects of soil, fertilizer, water, seed, density, protection, and tools and their interrelationships, it actively exerts people's subjective initiative, strengthens field management, promotes the healthy growth of group wheat, and thus obtains a complete set of cultivation techniques for high yields and bumper harvests. The practice of the two years of Great Leap Forward further revealed the interrelationship between "seedlings, plants, ears, and grains" of wheat and the dialectical relationship between the eight characters in the "Eight-Character Charter," thus creating key stages for high yields in turn, such as full and strong seedlings, safe wintering, strong jointing, many and large ears, many and full grains, and high yields and bumper harvests. It is necessary to tighten each link from planting to harvesting and continuously promote it. It is necessary to meet the needs in time according to the objective law of wheat growth and development in order to maximize the potential for increasing production, and also to carry out appropriate control management in response to the requirements of high yield and stable harvest; it is necessary to promote healthy early-stage production and lay a good foundation for high yields, and also to strengthen late-stage management at all times, so that management does not stop until the wheat is harvested. This is the specific application of the dialectical relationship of the unity of opposites in high-yield wheat cultivation; only in this way can high yields and bumper harvests be achieved.

(8) Tools The production process of wheat from planting to harvesting can be highly mechanized, which is one of the characteristics of wheat cultivation technology. At present, many state-owned farms in our country already have this condition and are rapidly moving towards the serialization of machinery and equipment; some people's communes have also begun to use mechanized cultivation, planting, harvesting and threshing, which plays a certain exemplary and promoting role in realizing the mechanization and modernization of agriculture in our country. However, while realizing the mechanization of wheat production, it is necessary to ensure the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, which is in line with the excellent tradition of intensive farming in our country. In the large-area high-yield squares, the cultivated layer is deep, the fertilization is uniform, the ground is flat and the ridges are straight, the soil is finely broken, there are no weeds, the emergence is good, the irrigation is uniform, the tillering is strong, and many ears are formed. Therefore, the broad masses of the people's communes are vigorously engaging in tool reform, technical innovation, and technical revolution, reforming and creating new farm tools that are efficient, labor-saving, inexpensive, and beautiful, mainly relying on local methods and combining local and foreign methods, and gradually transitioning from local to foreign methods. At present, people's communes in various places have created their own suitable new-style farm tools of various sizes for wheat field deep ploughing, fertilization, sowing, inter-cultivation and weeding, disease and insect control, and harvesting and threshing. These new farm tools have many styles and different performances, but they are all significantly superior to the old farm tools and are constantly being improved and improved.

The above is a brief summary of the technology of high-yield wheat cultivation in the process of comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, through practice, understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding, constantly enriching, developing, and improving. In addition, scientific research has been carried out in relevant aspects around cultivation and breeding, and many achievements have been made. For example, in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which originally mainly planted spring wheat, the expansion and conversion to winter wheat planting has achieved great success, not only expanding the multiple cropping index and adjusting the arrangement of labor and animal power, but also being more stable and high-yielding than spring wheat. At present, the proportion of winter and spring wheat in Xinjiang is gradually changing, and in southern Xinjiang, winter wheat has surpassed spring wheat. For example, the research on the investigation and sorting of wheat variety resources and the division of production areas has been carried out for many years since liberation, and there has been a further understanding of the characteristics of local varieties and the division of ecological types in our country, which can provide a reference for the introduction, domestication, hybridization and breeding, and promotion of good varieties. As for the selection and breeding of new wheat varieties, great achievements have been made since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the mass selection and breeding work has developed vigorously, presenting a magnificent new atmosphere. Many farmer seed selectors, such as Gong Wensheng from Neixiang, Henan, who bred Neixiang No. 5 wheat, and Chen Bangyuan from Quanjiao, Anhui, who bred Quanjiao No. 1 wheat, have achieved excellent results. In terms of distant hybridization, hybridization of wheat with rye and wheat with goosegrass has yielded promising offspring, pointing out a new direction for the breeding of new varieties with large ears and grains, strong stalks, and resistance to adversity. Farmers and seed selectors in various places, in the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, broke through the shackles of traditional concepts and theories, boldly tried, and conducted various experiments. They have achieved preliminary results in water conservancy and have accumulated some new data in genetics and breeding science, and are conducting various experiments in wheat. It should be seen that under the encouragement of the new atmosphere of the whole Party and the whole people running science, engaging in mass selection and breeding, and engaging in technical innovation, the emergence of new miracles and scientific theories can be counted on days. Other new scientific technologies such as ionizing radiation, atomic energy irradiation, ultrasonic waves, treatment of wheat seeds with stimulating agents to produce variations, and application of trace elements, gibberellin, humic acid salts, etc. to promote growth or change the comparative relationship between growth and development are also being studied in our country.

III. The Party's Leadership and the Mass Line are the Fundamental Guarantees for the Continuous Achievements in Wheat Production and Technology Reform.

The tremendous achievements that have been made in wheat production and technical reform over the past ten years are a victory for the Party's leadership and the large-scale mass movement, and a victory for the Party's General Line for Building Socialism. In the new era of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao timely summarized the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture from leading the masses to engage in the movement for high agricultural yields, which has played a great role in promoting the continued leap forward in agricultural production. The practice of the two consecutive years of high yields in 1958 and 1959 proved that wherever the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is conscientiously implemented, the wheat there will achieve high yields. The "Eight-Character Charter" is the product of the combination of the Party's leadership, mass experience, and scientific research. With the implementation and application of the "Eight-Character Charter" in wheat production and the continuous increase in wheat output, the specific content of the "Eight-Character Charter" will be continuously enriched, enriched, and developed accordingly, which will create conditions for further improving wheat production. Therefore, while vigorously implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, widely mobilize the masses and scientific and technical personnel to conduct in-depth research on the interrelationships and further application rules of the "Eight-Character Charter," and constantly summarize wheat cultivation techniques that are high-yielding and higher-yielding. Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the broad masses of farmers and scientific and technical personnel are high-spirited, dare to think and dare to do, set ambitious goals, establish great aspirations, boost their energy, and climb to new heights, adhering to the principles of "theory linked to practice" and "walking on two legs," and widely carry out high-level, sophisticated, and cutting-edge research related to wheat's "Eight-Character Charter," constantly creating newer cultivation techniques, better tools, and more high-yielding good varieties, and pushing wheat production in our country to a higher stage of development.

### 农业“八字宪法”在小麦丰产栽培上的运用

专栏：

    农业“八字宪法”在小麦丰产栽培上的运用
    金善宝代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理所作的报告。我现在就小麦生产方面发表一些意见。
      一、解放后我国小麦生产的巨大发展
    小麦是我国仅次于水稻的重要粮食作物，分布遍及全国，栽培面积达四亿亩以上，极大部分地区可以在秋季播种，夏季收获，称为冬小麦，最适于与春、夏播作物如稻、棉、杂粮等复种。主要的冬小麦产区为河南、山东、河北、山西、陕西、四川、江苏、安徽、湖北等省。在冬季严寒地区则做为春小麦栽培，其中以黑龙江、甘肃、新疆、青海、内蒙古等省区分布较多。
    我国小麦栽培有悠久的历史，初步考证在四千余年前即有种植，勤劳的农民积累有丰富的种麦经验，但在解放前，由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义长期的残酷剥削与压迫，农民生产情绪低落，生产条件和生产工具都极为落后，无力抗御病虫自然灾害，小麦生产水平极低，在1949年全国解放时每亩平均产量仅为八十六斤。因此，人们都把小麦看成是低产作物。解放后，通过土地改革还家和农业合作化运动，生产力解放，积极性高涨，在这一基础上党领导着全国农民对农业技术进行了一系列的改革，积肥造肥、兴修水利、群众选种、推行密植、防治病虫害，小麦生产直线上升，到1953年就已恢复到战前的最高水平，到1957年又比1953年增产30％。
    1958年在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，各地农民掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产技术大革新，全国深翻在一尺上下的麦田占小麦播种面积的三分之二，广泛增施肥料，增加播种数量，提高播种质量，推广优良品种，改良旧式农具和使用新式农具，大规模开展除虫防病运动，在战胜主要产区的百日长期干旱和不同程度的病虫灾害的情况下，小麦生产获得了惊人的增长，比1957年又提高了22.4％。就在这一年的农业生产大跃进中，毛主席总结了农民的增产经验和解放以来农业技术改革的经验，系统地提出了农业“八字宪法”，给我国农业生产和科学研究指出了高速度发展的道路。
    1959年，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的指引下，农业“八字宪法”得到了更全面、更细致地贯彻执行，在小麦生产上涌现了成千上万的连片大面积丰产方，如河南偃师、孟县，河北安国等都出现了平均亩产六百斤以上的万亩方；云南省富民县一万三千亩小麦，平均亩产五百二十一斤；新垦区青海柴达木盆地德令哈农场一万三千亩麦田平均亩产一千零五十七斤；香日德农场二千零六十亩麦田平均亩产一千一百斤，创造了史无前例的大面积丰产新纪录。这一年的小麦总产量又较大跃进的1958年增长了20.9％，相当于1949年的253％，呈现了连续大跃进的辉煌形势。
    今年的小麦生产，根据各地的报告，在连续两年跃进的经验基础上进一步认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，抓早、抓好，管细、管全，无论深耕、施肥、整地、播种、排灌、管理等措施，都比去年有了很大改进，范围广、数量大、质量好、做得及时，因而效益显著。目前北方麦田正在返青生长，南方麦田多已拔节孕穗，一片葱绿，十分健旺，比去年同时期麦苗生育更见良好、若干较为干旱地区，在大力抗旱和最近喜雨的情况下，已经战胜初期的旱害，只要肥水和管理措施及时跟上，很快就能赶上，亚热带地区的小麦已接近成熟，茂密肥硕的麦穗随风荡漾，呈现了一片丰收景象。各地群众干劲冲天，信心十足，乘胜前进，精益求精，誓夺今年小麦再一次的丰收，实现农业生产的持续大跃进。
      二、“八字宪法”既保证了小麦生产水平的迅速提高，也促进了丰产栽培理论的不断发展。
    1958和1959年连续两年大跃进的实践进一步证明了农业“八字宪法”是一个密切联系、相互促进的有机整体，不是八个字简单的、机械的总合。八个字中每个字的作用不一，土为基础，肥、水、种为前提，密为中心，保、管、工为保证，字字重要，缺一不可，不能互相代替。因此，必须因时因地，并结合小麦生长发育特点综合运用，才能充分发挥增产作用，两年来，由于在不同条件下因地制宜地综合运用“八字宪法”的结果，出现了前所未有的高密度的、穗大粒多而不倒伏的丰产麦田，也出现了从未见过的多达一百五十粒以上的麦穗王，在小麦增产措施上破除了许多陈旧的概念，创立了以密植为中心，全面贯彻“八字宪法”的、新的丰产栽培理论，为我国小麦生产和栽培科学写下了光辉的一页。
    （一）土　是作物的生长基地，居八字之首，是丰产栽培的基础。要使庄稼生长良好，必须有深厚肥沃的土层，才能根深叶茂，获得丰产。我国河南、山西、陕西一带勤劳的农民，很早就有用铣深翻获得丰产的经验，但在封建制度下的小农经济，只能在极小面积上进行，广大麦田由于农具简陋，动力不足，不能深耕深翻，形成“犁无三寸土”的浅耕现象。解放后，特别是在农业生产大跃进中，党领导群众大搞深耕运动，取得了很大的成绩。
    深耕结合多施有机肥料，使土肥相混相融，改善了土壤中的理化和生物环境，就可以在当年内基本熟化深层土壤，创造肥厚的耕作层，为小麦根系生长提供极为有利的条件。在短短的一年中熟化土壤，这在土壤学上是一个革命，一个创造，它有力地证明了劳动可以创造而且可以在短期内创造出肥沃土壤的理论，彻底粉碎了资产阶级学者的土壤肥力递减的反动观点，从而更好地武装人们向自然界做斗争的力量。实践证明，深耕适度，增施有机肥料，土肥充分混匀，破坏了坚硬的犁底层，使土壤孔隙度适当增加，土壤透气性和蓄水性得到改善，土壤温度和湿度都相应提高，有利于好气性细菌的繁殖与活动，从而加速了土壤养分的分解和根系的吸收利用。
    在深耕技术上，在一般情况下应掌握上翻下松，不乱土层的原则，除增施基肥、全层施肥外，还要结合晒垡炕土、浇透底墒、精细整地、做好保墒等工作，才能达到预期的效果。
    （二）肥　大量施用有机肥料是我国作物栽培技术的特点之一，我国农民在这一方面积累了极丰富的经验。有机肥料不但具备作物生长所需要的各种养分，还能熟化土壤，改进土壤结构，便利植物吸收，所以养猪积肥以及开辟各种可能的有机肥源是我国作物丰产栽培的基本提前。近年来，小麦生产实践和试验研究明确了以有机肥料为基肥，以化肥为种肥和追肥，基肥为主，追肥为辅，增施基肥，分期追肥，基肥不足早施分蘖肥，在南方强调腊肥，在北方早施返青、拔节肥并与浇水相结合，才能提高肥料利用率。根据最近两年的初步分析，亩产一千斤左右的小麦；吸收纯氮约二十四斤，磷酸约十四斤，氧化钾约四十斤，肥料利用率在目前栽培条件下，农家氮肥约为25％至50％，磷肥约25％，钾肥约30％，也就是每亩需要施用纯氮四十八至九十六斤，磷酸约五十六斤，氧化钾约一百四十斤，折合一般粗肥为一万五千至二万斤，在肥力高的土壤上除施用氮肥外还要增用磷、钾肥，促进小麦健壮不倒，肥力不足的麦田则应大力提倡增施氮肥。
    （三）水　解放前我国主要产麦区的小麦有90％以上种植在不能灌溉的旱地上，因此收成很低而且极不稳定。解放后特别是大跃进以来，大兴水利，麦田灌溉面积大为增加。为全面增产打下了牢靠的基础。在灌溉技术方面，在我国北方农民固有的看天、看地、看苗浇水和“三肥五水”的经验基础上，发展了有深有浅、适时适量的多次勤浇的灌溉方法：犁地前天旱浇底墒水要深，深耕后浇塌地水要透，出苗后浇倒针水要浅，越冬前浇封冻水要大，返青水土墒足宜稍晚，土墒差则稍早，拔节水要适时适量，看苗促进。此外，再根据降雨情况决定是否浇孕穗水，抽穗开花水、灌浆水和麦黄水，以及浇水时期和数量。在南方小麦生长中期以后常嫌雨水过多，则要注意排水防渍。近一、二年来，许多地区已经初步建立了分级排水体系，做到沟沟相通，由浅而深，纵横交错，排水通畅。
    无论南方或北方，都在大搞农田基本建设和园田化，地平如镜，埂直如线，沟渠相连，排灌两便。
    （四）种　选用良种并在优良的条件下培植是获得丰产最经济而有效的方法。目前各地采用的小麦良种一般都在不同程度上具有穗大粒多、品质优良、秆强口紧、抗病性强等优良特点。由于党对品种事业的重视和正确领导，解放后良种面积迅速扩大，良种质量逐步提高，优秀的农民选种家和各级科学研究机关与院校不断地创育出新的优良品种，陆续交付生产应用。目前全国推广种植的小麦良种已有二百七十七个，占麦田总面积的92％，一般增产10％至30％，这些良种都在不断更替，推陈出新。为了保证良种供应与保持优良的种性，各地人民公社根据中央“四自一辅”（自繁自选自留自用，辅之以少量调剂）的方针，都开始建立良种繁育场和种子专业队，进行小麦良种繁育和选种工作。近年来推广良种的经验证明，在人民公社的有利条件下，小麦良种要合理配置，根据茬口、地力、地势、劳畜力及机具等情况选用各自适宜的、生育期长短不同的良种搭配种植，以发挥品种增产的潜力并避免成熟收获时的过分紧张和生育期间万一发生的自然灾害。大跃进以来，在贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”中还观察到随着肥水条件的改善和合理密植的发展，对于小麦品种特征特性也提出了新的要求：在肥力水平高、栽培管理细致的条件下，分蘖适中、株高中等偏矮、茎秆坚硬不倒、穗大粒大、粒多粒饱、早期叶片较窄、直立生长、封垅较晚的品种，最适于密植丰产栽培。大跃进的事实也打破了过去对于品种生产力和适应性的传统概念。只要各种增产因素的配合得到改进，小麦品种的增产潜力可以不断提高，适应地区也可以更为扩大。这对于良种的合理布局新品种的选育，有着很大的启示作用。
    （五）密　解放前大部分麦田应用稀植，北方宽行大垅，行距多在一尺以上，南方采用点播与撒播，每亩播种量一般为五到八斤，全田成穗数不过十万上下，株矮穗小，产量很低；只有少数肥水充足的地点，才使用较多的播种量，进行宽幅条播，获得较高的产量。解放后，随着生产条件的改善，党领导群众因地制宜地大力贯彻密植措施，从提倡条播，到改缩耧腿，适当增加播种量，以至推行窄行条播机，到1959　年小麦密植面积已达麦田的80％，播种量已提高到冬小麦每亩十五至三十斤，春小麦二十五至五十斤，对小麦增产起了显著作用。
    实践证明，合理密植是实现增株增穗、增粒增产的中心环节。由于在同一土地面积上种植较多的植株，就有可能最大限度地利用土壤中的养分与水分、空气中的二氧化炭和太阳能，进行物质代谢，促进麦株生长，从而获得丰产。两年来，在连续大跃进和综合贯彻“八字宪法”的实践中，合理密植在理论上又有了新的发展：（1）合理密植是群体最大的发展，是从种到收贯穿全部丰产栽培技术的中心，也就是从种到苗、到蘖、到株、到穗、到粒的密度动态的合理掌握过程，不是简单地播种数量和方式的问题。（2）在正确安排个体与群体的关系上，既要有足够的麦苗和绿色体面积，以充分利用营养条件和光能，又不能过密以保证单株在群体中良好的生长发育。（3）高额产量的获得是在穗多、穗大、粒大三者相互协调的情况下获得的。在目前大田栽培条件下，如要达到足够多的穗数，还必须从适当增加播种量以保证有足够的主茎穗入手；而健壮的小麦又必然全产生分蘖。因此，依靠主茎穗并争取尽可能多的分蘖穗是密植丰产栽培的关键。（4）合理密植必须针对增株增穗对于营养和光照条件的需要，因地制宜地选用适宜的良种并配合相应的栽培措施。反之，不同的自然条件，也必须应用不同的密植方法。凡是能够促进苗期根系发育，分蘖叶片、健壮生长、避免过早封垅、拔节前后通风透光良好、茎基部生长粗壮结实、抽穗开花期间保持尽可能大的有效光合面积的各种措施，都是有利于达到密植增产的。在这一方面，因地制宜采用与密植相应的播种方式是很必要的，目前有些地区，在肥力水平较高的条件下采用宽幅条播密植，麦幅与幅距各约四至六寸或幅距稍大于播幅，对于构成高额丰产是有一定作用的。
    小麦合理密植的理论和方法，还在不断发展中，今年全国各地科学研究机关、院校和人民公社的试验网集中力量从各个专业的不同角度猛攻密植问题，对于进一步揭发和阐明合理密植的客观规律，肯定地要做出很大贡献。
    （六）保　解放前我国小麦多虫多灾，其中严重的有地下害虫、吸浆虫、线虫病、三种黑穗病、赤霉病、三种锈病等，这是小麦生产低下和不稳定的主要原因之一。解放后积极研究了主要病虫的发生规律及其防治办法，制造各种特效农药，推广土洋药械和抗逆性强的优良品种，并加强了对病虫发生的预测预报制度，已经基本上消灭了线虫病和三种黑穗病，基本上控制了地下害虫和吸浆虫的为害。三种锈病也得到进一步的防治，许多抵抗锈病的良种已经在生产上广泛种植。这些情况使我们在控制小麦病虫害的发生上赢得了绝对的主动地位，从而保证了小麦的丰产丰收。但是病虫的繁殖率极高，病菌的变异性又大，对病虫的斗争上还要随时提高警惕，做好以防为主、及早扑灭的防治工作。
    （七）管　管是“八字宪法”综合为用的体现，它是根据地区自然条件和小麦植株生长发育的特点，在充分运用土、肥、水、种、密、保、工的增产作用及其相互关系的基础上，积极发挥人的主观能动性，加强田间管理，促进群体小麦健壮生长，从而获得丰产丰收的一整套栽培技术。两年大跃进的实践进一步揭发了小麦“苗、株、穗、粒”的相互关系和“八字宪法”中八个字的辩证关系，从而创立了苗全苗壮、安全越冬、拔节健壮、穗多穗大、粒多粒饱、丰产丰收等依次相连的丰产关键阶段，必须从种到收，环环扣紧，不断促进。既要根据小麦生长发育的客观规律及时满足需要，以便最大限度地发挥增产潜力，又要针对高产稳收的要求，进行适当控制管理；既要促进前期生产健壮，为丰产打下良好基础，又要时刻加强后期管理，做到麦子不收、管理不停。这是矛盾发展统一的辩证关系在小麦丰产栽培上的具体运用；只有这样才能实现丰产丰收。
    （八）工　小麦从种到收的生产过程可以进行高度机械化作业，这是小麦栽培技术的特点之一。目前我国不少国营农场已经具备这种条件，并迅速走向机具配置系列化；部分的人民公社也已开始采用机械化耕种和收获脱粒，对于实现我国农业机械化和现代化，起着一定的示范和促进作用。但在实现小麦生产机械化的同时必须保证贯彻农业“八字宪法”，符合我国精耕细作的优良传统。在大面积丰产方内做到耕层深，施肥匀，地平埂直，土壤细碎，不见杂草，保证出苗好，灌水匀，分蘖旺，成穗多。因此，广大人民公社正在大闹工具改革、技术革新和技术革命，以土为主、土洋并举、由土到洋地改革创制效率高、用工省、价廉物美的新农具，现在各地人民公社，无论在麦田深耕、施肥、播种、中耕除草、病虫防治和收获脱粒方面，都已有各自适宜的大小新式农具的创制，这些新农具式样繁多，性能不一，但都比旧有农具显著优越，并在不断改进提高。
    以上所述是小麦丰产栽培技术在综合贯彻农业“八字宪法”的过程中，通过实践、认识、再实践、再认识，不断丰富、不断发展和提高的简略概括。此外，还围绕着栽培和育种进行了有关方面的科学研究并取得了不少成就。例如，在原来种植春小麦为主的新疆维吾尔自治区扩种改种冬小麦获得了很大成功，不但扩大了复种指数，调节了劳畜力的安排，而且比春小麦更为稳定丰产，目前新疆地区的冬春麦比例在逐渐变化，而在南疆则已后来居上，冬小麦已经压倒了春小麦。又如有关小麦品种资源的调查整理和生产区域的划分的研究，解放以来曾经进行了许多工作，对于我国地方品种的特征特性和生态类型的划分以及良种的区域适应性有了进一步的认识，可以提供引种驯化杂交育种和良种推广的参考。至于小麦新品种的选育工作，解放以后取得了很大的成绩，尤其是大跃进以来，群选群育工作有了蓬勃的发展，呈现了波澜壮阔的新气象，许多农民选种家如河南内乡龚文生选育的内乡五号小麦，安徽全椒陈邦元选育的全椒一号小麦等都已获得优异成果。在远缘杂交方面，小麦与黑麦的杂交和小麦与鹅观草的杂交都得到了有希望的后代，为大穗大粒、秆强抗逆新品种的培育指出了新的发展方向。各地农民选种家本着敢想敢干的精神，冲破了传统概念和理论的束缚，大胆尝试，多方试验，已经在水利上取得了初步结果并在遗传育种科学上积累了一些新的资料，在小麦方面也正在进行各种各样的试验。应该看到，在全党全民办科学，大搞群选群育、大搞技术革新的新气象的鼓舞下，新的奇迹和科学理论的出现可以计日而待。他如应用新的科学技术如电离辐射、原子能照射、超声波、刺激药剂处理小麦种子以产生变异以及应用微量元素、赤霉素，胡敏酸盐等促进生长或改变生长与发育的对比关系，在我国也都在进行研究。
      三、党的领导与群众路线是小麦生产与技术改革不断获得成就的根本保证。
    十年来小麦生产和技术改革都获得了巨大的成就，这是党的领导和大搞群众运动的胜利，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利。党中央和毛主席在大跃进和人民公社化的新年代里，从领导群众大搞农业丰产运动中及时总结出农业“八字宪法”，这对于促进农业生产的持续跃进有着很大的作用。1958年和1959年连续两年的丰产实践证明，哪里认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，那里的小麦就获得丰产。“八字宪法”是党的领导、群众经验和科学研究三结合的产物。随着“八字宪法”在小麦生产上的贯彻运用和小麦产量的不断上升，“八字宪法”的具体内容也就相应地获得不断的充实、丰富和发展，这就为进一步提高小麦生产创造了条件。所以在大力贯彻“八字宪法”的同时，必须坚持政治挂帅，广泛发动群众和科学技术人员深入研究“八字宪法”相互联系和进一步运用的规律，不断总结出高产更高产的小麦栽培技术。在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，广大农民群众和科学技术人员意气风发，敢想敢做，树雄心、立大志、鼓干劲、攀高峰，本着“理论联系实际”和“两条腿走路”的方针，广泛开展有关小麦“八字宪法”的高、精、尖的研究，不断创造出更新的栽培技术、更好的工具和更丰产的优良品种，把我国小麦生产推向更高的发展阶段。
