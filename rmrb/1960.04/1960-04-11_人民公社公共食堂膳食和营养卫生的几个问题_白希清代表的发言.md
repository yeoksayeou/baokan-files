I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's reports on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 State Budget.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the glorious illumination of the General Line, the labor enthusiasm of the masses is rising higher and higher, and the spirit of creation is being developed more and more. 1960 will be a year of even greater leaps forward.

In such an excellent situation, Party and government leaders at all levels have comprehensively organized production and comprehensively arranged the people's lives. Running public canteens well, ensuring that the working people eat their fill, eat well, eat cleanly, eat comfortably, and maintain their health is indeed a major event in socialist construction. The importance of running public canteens well also lies in the fact that after the people's communes, public canteens have not only become places for commune members to eat, but have also become the center of commune members' political, economic, and cultural activities, and a great classroom for cultivating communist ideological consciousness. It will become an important guarantee for consolidating the people's commune system and a solid position for socialism. Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage greater efforts, thanks to the attention of Party committees at all levels and the strengthening of leadership over public canteens, public canteens in various places have not only been further consolidated, but have also made many developments in business management, sideline production, cooking utensil reform, and dietary nutrition. Commune members also recognize the superiority of public canteens, and therefore do everything possible to cultivate and support them. The current public canteens are indestructible, unshakable, and as solid as a rock, as stable as Mount Tai.

In the context of the continuous development of public canteens in the people's communes, the inventions and creations of the masses are truly emerging one after another. Heishan County, Liaoning Province, has created a method for increasing the edible quantity of corn. This not only ensures that the working people eat their fill and eat well, but also saves grain. After its promotion, the masses across the country welcomed it enthusiastically. On this basis, many new developments and creations have emerged, forming a revolutionary movement in grain cooking methods. After promotion, application, and research in various places, it has been proven that the quantity-increasing cooking method is indeed an advanced method and a major initiative by the broad masses of people in innovating cooking technology. It has become an important measure for planning grain use, saving grain, and ensuring health, and is worthy of promotion.

Using the quantity-increasing method to cook rice, steaming the rice first, then washing it, and then cooking it, can increase the yield from 2.5 to 3 jin of rice per jin to 4 to 5 jin. Using the ground-soup-noodle method or the scalded-corn-flour method for corn can increase the yield from 1.6 to 1.8 jin of cornbread per jin of flour to 2.8 to 3 jin. Using the scalded-flour method for flour can increase the yield from 1.4 jin of steamed buns per jin to 1.8 to 2 jin. Extensive practice has proven that this method not only increases the rice yield by 30% to 50%, but also improves the quality of the staple food. For example, cornbread made with ground-soup noodles is fine, soft, "meaty" (elastic), and delicious. Moreover, soup noodles can be used to make buns, dumplings, noodles, etc., providing conditions for diversifying corn cooking. Therefore, the quantity-increasing method is welcomed by the broad masses.

Eating staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method can save grain, and the health situation is good. The extensive practice of the masses has proven that eating staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method can save grain. During the promotion of the quantity-increasing method, there is no restriction on food intake. The results of long-term consumption prove that grain is indeed saved. For example, some factories saved 12% of grain when eating staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method, and some even reached 15%, while the calories in the diet remained at more than 3,400 kilocalories, meeting the needs of human physiology and labor. In experiments and research among students in middle schools and workers' schools, comparing calorie consumption with the calories contained in the diet shows that when eating staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method, the calories in the diet can not only meet the calorie consumption of labor and physiology, but also leave a surplus of 102 kilocalories. Preliminary research results from many places indicate that eating quantity-increased staple foods does not lead to weight loss, and labor efficiency, endurance, and physiological functions are all normal. This is enough to show that eating staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method can maintain the body's energy needs. It can be seen in the promotion of the quantity-increasing method that staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method are easy to digest, especially for the elderly, children, and patients with stomach problems whose digestive functions are weak. Some patients with stomach problems have shown significant improvement after eating staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method. The masses believe that eating staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method has three advantages: first, it saves grain; second, it is fine, soft, and palatable; and third, it cures stomach problems. Therefore, everyone is satisfied, full of energy, and actively promotes it.

The quantity-increasing method is also beneficial for preserving nutrients in food. First of all, the quantity-increasing method utilizes the previously unutilized parts of the grain. For example, the corn-soup-noodle processing method grinds all the previously underutilized germ in the flour, and the germ contains more nutrients. Therefore, it relatively increases the nutrient content in the staple food. Another example is the double-steaming method for increasing the quantity of rice, steaming first and then washing, and then steaming the washed rice into rice. Steaming first and then washing is very beneficial for preserving B vitamins because during steaming, the B vitamins on the surface of the rice grains penetrate into the inner layer of the rice grains, reducing losses during washing. At the same time, steaming reduces the amount of broken grains washed away, and less powder is washed away, thus reducing the loss of starch and other substances. At the same time, because the starch in staple foods cooked with the quantity-increasing method absorbs water and gelatinizes more fully, the starch granules are large and dispersed. Therefore, the heating time can be shortened during cooking, and the firepower used is also smaller than the old method. These aspects are all beneficial for vitamin preservation. The results of nutrient composition analysis show that the thiamine retention rate in quantity-increased rice is higher than that in the old method, reaching a maximum of 43%, riboflavin 30%, and nicotinic acid 69%. The thiamine retention rate in corn with the quantity-increasing method is higher than that in the old method, reaching a maximum of 33%, riboflavin 13%, and nicotinic acid 23%. The preservation of these vitamins is very important for improving human health.

From this, it can be seen that the quantity-increasing cooking method for staple foods has many advantages. Whether from the practical effects of the broad masses or from scientific observation, it has been proven that it can save grain, is nutritious and delicious, and ensures health, which is in line with scientific laws. If this new cooking method is promoted throughout the country, the amount of grain saved will be very considerable, which is a major event in the national economy. Therefore, the movement to promote the quantity-increasing method should be adhered to and should be continuously consolidated and improved.

The discovery of the quantity-increasing method proves once again that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. Scientific research workers should go into practice, into life, and into the masses, earnestly study the inventions and creations of the masses, summarize the experiences of the masses, and improve and promote them. At present, health personnel, especially nutritional health workers, must combine with the masses, summarize the mass experiences in various places, study the changes of various nutrients, calorie supply and consumption, digestion and absorption, etc., and further improve and enhance the quantity-increasing cooking method for staple foods, so that the quantity-increasing method can play a more active role in saving grain and protecting people's health.

With the vigorous development of national technological innovation and technological revolution, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking utensils in public canteens have also developed rapidly, and the inventions and creations of the masses in this regard are also very amazing. For example, the cornbread machine created in Tianjin can produce more than 5,800 cornbreads per hour from raw corn. The Zhengzhuangzi staple food processing station supplies staple foods to more than 10,000 people in 260 surrounding residential canteens, which is warmly welcomed by the masses, facilitates the masses, saves labor, and guarantees production. Not only is this the case in cities, but rural public canteens are also vigorously carrying out cooking utensil reform. Some provinces have promoted more than 1.3 million mechanized and semi-mechanized cooking utensils. With the reform of cooking utensils, the number of people served by the mechanized canteen can be increased by multiples or even several times. Therefore, ensuring hygiene is even more important. On the other hand, the reform of cooking utensils greatly saves manpower and reduces the labor intensity of cooks, which creates favorable conditions for doing a good job in nutrition and hygiene. In the past year or so, health workers in various places have created many good methods and experiences in ensuring the hygiene of public canteens. The hygiene of public canteens after the mechanization of cooking utensils is a new topic. Our health workers and scientific research workers must quickly catch up, put forward a new set of methods and experiences, do a better job in public canteen hygiene, ensure the health of the working people, and promote the continuous development of cooking utensil mechanization.

The organizational form of the people's commune public canteen also has special advantages for gradually improving the people's nutritional level. In the past year or so, various places have also made many achievements in this regard. Some places plan canteen vegetable gardens according to the number of people eating, based on the principle of meeting nutritional needs, and produce vegetables. This not only ensures that commune members have vegetables to eat every day and that there is a variety of vegetables, but also improves the nutritional level. At present, all places are vigorously developing the family production of canteens. Many canteens not only have their own vegetable bases, but also raise pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks, not only achieving self-sufficiency, but also having surpluses that can be sold to the state. Doing a good job in family production is not only an important condition for consolidating rural canteens, but also can further improve the people's nutritional level, enhance physical fitness, and make everyone energetic and full of energy. Organizing canteen production in this planned way provides extremely favorable conditions for nutrition and health care work, which is simply incomparable to each household starting its own stove. In the past year, nutrition workers across the country, under the leadership of the Party, have demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation, mobilized the masses in 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, 177 cities and counties, and 14 ethnic minority areas to conduct nutritional surveys and research on workers, farmers, students, staff, the elderly, infants, pregnant women, etc., completing the task stipulated in the ten-year plan in the twelve-year long-term plan for scientific and technological development in one year. This provides extremely important scientific basis for improving people's dietary nutrition, promoting people's health, and ensuring production. On the basis of achieving this great achievement, nutrition and health workers across the country must, together with health workers in various places, consult with the masses under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels to better plan, produce, preserve, and eat the family production of people's commune public canteens, especially vegetable production. Running people's commune canteens well is an important aspect of organizing people's economic life, a major event in socialist construction, and also an important link in ensuring the great development and great leap forward of socialist production. With public canteens, it is not only very beneficial for ensuring the hygiene of the working people, but also beneficial for gradually improving the people's nutritional level. Our health workers have the ambition and determination to go deep into the masses and the front lines, organize a continued great leap forward in nutrition and hygiene work, make greater contributions to the consolidation and development of public canteens, and serve industrial and agricultural production and the health of the hardworking and brave people of our country.

    人民公社公共食堂膳食和营养卫生的几个问题
    白希清代表的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告。
    在毛泽东思想的教导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，目前群众的劳动热情愈来愈高涨，创造的精神愈来愈发扬，1960年将是更大的跃进年。
    在这样的大好形势下，各级党政领导，既全面地组织了生产，也全面地安排人民生活。而办好公共食堂，使劳动人民吃得饱，吃得好，吃得干净，吃得舒适可口，保证健康，确是社会主义建设中的一件大事。办好公共食堂之所以重要，还在于人民公社化以后，公共食堂不仅是社员吃饭的地方，而且已经成为社员的政治、经济、文化活动的中心，培养共产主义思想觉悟的大课堂。它将成为巩固人民公社制度的重要保证和社会主义的坚实阵地。在党的八届八中全会反右倾鼓干劲的号召下，由于各级党委的重视，加强了对公共食堂的领导，各地的公共食堂不仅进一步巩固了，而且在经营管理、副业生产、炊具改革、膳食营养等方面都有了很多的发展。社员们也认识到公共食堂的优越性，因而也千方百计地培育它，扶植它。现在的公共食堂是风吹不垮，雷打不散，坚若磐石，稳如泰山。
    在人民公社公共食堂不断发展的形势下，群众的发明创造真是层出不穷。辽宁省黑山县，创造了玉米食用增量法。既保证劳动人民吃得饱、吃得好，又节约粮食。推广以后，全国各地的群众极力欢迎，在这个基础上又有许多新的发展和创造，形成了一个粮食烹调方法的革新运动。经过各地的推广应用和研究，证明增量烹调法确实是一个先进的方法，是广大人民群众革新烹调技术的一个重大创举，成为计划用粮，节约用粮，保证健康的重要措施，是值得推广的。
    采用增量法做饭，将大米先蒸，后淘，再煮，可使每斤大米由原来出二斤半至三斤饭，提高到四至五斤。玉米用磨汤子面的方法或玉米粉烫面法，可由原来一斤面出一点六至一点八斤窝头，提高到二点八至三斤。面粉用烫面法，可由每斤原出一点四斤馒头，提高到一点八至二斤。大量的实践证明，这样做法，不仅出饭率增加了30％至50％，而且主食质量提高了。如玉米用汤子面做的窝窝头，又细又软，“肉头”（有弹性）可口，而且可以用汤子面做包子、饺子、面条等等，为玉米烹调多样化提供了条件，因此增量法受到广大群众的欢迎。
    食用增量法烹调的主食，能节约粮食，健康情况是良好的。群众的大量实践证明，食用增量法烹调的主食，可以节约粮食。在推广增量法中进食量并无限制，长期食用的结果证明，粮食是节约下来了。如有的工厂吃增量法烹调的主食时，粮食节约了12％，有的达到15％，而膳食中的热量仍保持在三千四百多仟卡，满足了人体生理和劳动的需要。在中学和职工学校的学生中试验研究，以热量消耗和膳食中所含热能相比，则食用增量法烹调主食时，膳食中热能不仅能满足劳动及生理上的热量消耗，而且还余一百零二仟卡。从许多地方初步研究结果看来，吃增量法主食时，体重并未减轻，劳动效率、耐力、生理功能都是正常的，这就足以说明食用增量法烹调的主食，是可以维持身体的热能需要的。在推广增量法中看出，增量法烹调的主食，容易消化，尤其对胃脏消化功能较弱的老人、小孩、胃病患者是非常适宜的，有些胃病患者，在吃增量法烹调的主食后，胃病有显著好转。群众认为食用增量法烹调的主食，有三个好处，一节约粮食，二细软适口，三治好了胃病，所以大家满意，干劲十足，积极推广。
    增量法对保存食物中营养素也是有利的，首先是增量法把粮食中原来未利用的部分利用起来了，如玉米汤子面加工法，就把过去磨粉中未充分利用的胚芽，全部磨在汤子面里，而胚芽中养分较多，因此相对地增加了主食中的营养素含量。再如用大米双蒸法增量，先蒸后淘，然后再将淘过的米蒸成饭。先蒸后淘对乙族维生素的保存非常有利，因为蒸时，大米表皮的乙族维生素渗入米粒内层，减少了淘洗时的流失，同时，蒸后淘洗碎粒少，冲刷下来的粉末少，因此减少了淀粉等其他物质的流失。同时由于增量法烹调的主食，淀粉吸水以后，糊化较充分，淀粉粒大，分散，因此在烹调过程中，可以缩短加热时间，所用火力，也较旧法为小。这些方面，对维生素保存，都是有利的。营养成分分析结果说明，增量法大米饭中硫胺素保存率较旧法提高，最多时可达43％，核黄素30％，尼克酸69％，玉米增量法硫胺素保存率较旧法提高，最多时可达33％，核黄素13％，尼克酸23％，这些维生素的保存，对于增进人体健康是十分重要的。
    于此可见，主食增量烹调法是具有许多优点的，无论从广大群众实践的效果或者是从科学观察上来看，都证明了它是可以节约粮食，营养可口，保证健康，是符合于科学规律的。这个新的烹调方法，如果在全国各地推广，节约粮食的数字，将是非常可观的，在国民经济上是一件大事，因此推广增量法的运动，应该坚持下去，并应不断的巩固与提高。
    增量法的发现，又一次证明了群众的智慧是无穷的。科学研究工作者，应该到实际中去，到生活中去，到群众中去，认真研究群众的发明创造，总结群众的经验，加以提高与推广。当前，卫生人员特别是营养卫生工作者必须与群众结合，总结各地的群众经验，研究各种营养素的变化、热量供应与消耗、消化与吸收等，进一步改进和提高主食增量烹调法，使增量法在节约粮食方面，以及保护人民健康上，起到更加积极的作用。
    随着全国技术革新和技术革命的蓬勃发展，公共食堂的炊具机械化和半机械化也发展得很快，群众在这方面的创造发明也是很惊人的。如天津创造的窝头机，从玉米元粮做成窝窝头，整个操作过程连续化，每小时可生产窝窝头五千八百多个，郑庄子主食加工站供应周围二百六十个居民食堂的一万多人的主食，受到群众的热烈欢迎，便利了群众，节约了劳动力，保证了生产。不仅城市如此，农村公共食堂也在大力开展炊具改革，有的省推广机械化、半机械化炊具达一百三十多万件，炊具改革以后，随之而来的就是机械化了的食堂，如何加强卫生工作，保证营养卫生的问题。这因为炊具机械化以后，供应和服务的人数可以成倍的甚至数倍地增加，因此保证卫生的问题就更为重要。另一方面，炊具改革后大大的节省了人力，减轻了炊事人员的劳动强度，这就为搞好营养卫生，创造了有利条件。在过去一年多的时间里，各地卫生工作者，在保证公共食堂卫生上，创造了许多好的办法和经验，炊具机械化以后的公共食堂卫生是一个新的课题，我们卫生工作和科学研究工作者一定要迅速的跟上去，提出一套新的办法和经验，把公共食堂卫生搞得更好，保证劳动人民健康，促进炊具机械化的不断发展。
    人民公社公共食堂的组织形式，对于逐步提高人民营养水平上也具有特殊的优越性。在过去一年多以来，各地在这方面也做出了不少成绩，有的地方按照吃饭的人数，以满足营养需要的原则，规划食堂菜地，生产蔬菜，这不但保证了社员每天有菜吃，菜的品种多样化，而且也提高了营养水平。目前各地都在大搞食堂家底生产，有许多食堂不仅有自己的蔬菜基地，而且还喂养了猪、羊，鸡、鸭；不仅做到自给，而且还有余，可以卖给国家。搞好家底生产，不仅是巩固农村食堂的重要条件，而且可以再进一步提高人民营养水平，增强体质，使得人人精力充沛，干劲十足。这样有计划地组织食堂的生产为营养保健工作提供了极为有利的条件，实非各家各户自起炉灶所能比拟。一年来，全国营养工作者在党的领导下，发挥了共产主义大协作的精神，发动了群众在全国二十六个省、市、自治区，一百七十七个市县和十四个民族居住的地方，对工人、农民、学生、职员、老人、婴幼儿、孕妇等进行了营养调查研究，用一年时间完成了十二年科学技术发展远景规划中规定十年完成的任务，这对改善人民膳食营养，促进人民健康、保证生产，提供了极为重要的科学依据。全国各地营养卫生工作者，在取得这一巨大成绩的基础上，一定同各地卫生工作者一道，在各级党组织的领导下和群众商量，把人民公社公共食堂的家底生产，特别是蔬菜生产规划的更好、生产的好、保存的好、吃的更好。办好人民公社食堂是组织人民经济生活的一个重要方面，是社会主义建设中的一件大事，也是保证社会主义生产大发展、大跃进的重要环节之一，有了公共食堂，不仅在保证劳动人民的卫生上是非常有利的，而且在逐步提高人民营养水平上也是有利的。我们卫生工作者，有雄心、有壮志要深入群众、深入现场，在营养卫生工作上组织继续大跃进，为公共食堂的巩固发展做出更大的贡献，为工农业生产服务，为勤劳勇敢的我国广大人民的健康服务。
