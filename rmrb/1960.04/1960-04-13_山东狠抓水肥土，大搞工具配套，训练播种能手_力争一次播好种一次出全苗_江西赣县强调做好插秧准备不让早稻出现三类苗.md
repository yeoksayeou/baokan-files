This dispatch from Jinan on the 12th reports that Shandong is engaged in an intense and heated struggle against drought for spring planting, vowing to win complete and robust spring seedlings. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the entire party and all people to continue to prioritize drought-resistant spring planting and drought-resistant wheat protection as the overriding central task, to work hard for twenty days to ensure timely and early planting of spring crops, planting fully and well, and achieving one sowing with full and robust seedlings.

Currently, Shandong is experiencing a severe drought, which has become the biggest obstacle to timely early sowing and achieving full seedling emergence. Therefore, the people of Shandong are determined to turn adversity into opportunity and transform drought into motivation, focusing on the "water" aspect. Currently, over five million people are engaged in drought-resistant spring planting, and thirty-six million mu of the province's fifty-five million mu of spring fields have been transformed into ridge fields, garden fields, and water-conserved fields. Over eighteen million mu of land lacking water are actively digging groundwater to replenish moisture and create moisture. According to incomplete statistics, in the past month or more, over forty-six thousand new machine wells and brick wells, over fifteen thousand temporary wells have been dug, over eight thousand mountain springs and mountain ditches have been dug and dammed, eliminating water conservancy dead ends on over eight million mu, and irrigating over seven million mu of spring land.

With "water" leading the way, followed by "fertilizer," water, fertilizer, and soil are working together to eliminate bare-field planting, which is another major measure to achieve full seedling emergence. Therefore, a large-scale campaign to accumulate and transport fertilizer and transform bad, thin, and remote lands has also been launched along with water conservancy construction. Currently, the area of spring fields fertilized with base fertilizer accounts for about 80% of the total area of spring fields. Many saline-alkali lands that are difficult to obtain seedlings from are being transformed by methods such as water storage to wash away alkali, silt deposition to suppress alkali, and sand covering to suppress alkali, so that large areas of land are prepared finely, well, evenly, and firmly.

Past experience has also proven that one good sowing and achieving full and robust seedlings is a decisive key to ensuring increased production throughout the year. In the past, some areas of Shandong Province, despite having made full preparations for water, fertilizer, soil, and seeds, still experienced seedling shortages and row breaks on 15% to 20% of the area. The reason was that they had not mastered sowing techniques well. This year, Party committees at all levels in Shandong attach great importance to the sowing link. Many areas began last winter to formulate the "seven characters" for spring sowing: deep (deep plowing), moisture (moisture conservation), fertilizer (more and finer application), seeds (improved seeds), medicine (seed treatment), row (east-west rows changed to north-south rows), and early (timely early sowing), as specifications to ensure full and vigorous seedlings. Since the beginning of spring, a large number of professional training classes have been held to train over one million sowing technicians and plow operators, and 189,000 sweet potato seedling cultivation technicians. Before sowing began, "three sets" were generally achieved: first, technicians and sowers were assigned according to plots and blocks, and tools and animal power were matched into sets. Second, seed treatment procedures were matched into sets, for example, for cotton seeds, selection, drying, soaking, mixing, and germination tests were not skipped. Third, sowing specifications were complete. Poor moisture, unrefined soil, poor seeds, and poor control of underground pests can all affect full seedling emergence at one time. Therefore, in terms of sowing specifications, the authority should be given to skilled plow operators. At the beginning of sowing, leading cadres at all levels personally took action, conducting trial sowing several times, holding on-site meetings to exchange experiences, clarifying the experience of various types of soil, soil moisture, and one sowing for full and robust seedlings, and planting a large number of "reserve seedlings" in the fields for transplanting.

In order to ensure one good sowing and one full seedling emergence, the Party committees at all levels in Shandong also adopted four effective measures in their leadership methods:

(1) Organizing over 800,000 cadres from six levels—province, prefecture, county, commune, brigade, and team—to meet in the fields, dividing areas of responsibility, and eating, living, and working with the commune members, acting as both commanders, fighters, and technicians. This greatly boosted the morale of the vast number of commune members, and the spring sowing preparation work became more meticulous, practical, and specific.

(2) Mobilizing the forces of all departments of industry, agriculture, commerce, academia, and the military from the province to the commune to support the struggle against drought for spring planting and drought-resistant wheat protection. Currently, one million people have been drawn from large and medium-sized water conservancy construction sites to support drought resistance, enabling production teams to maintain sufficient labor.

(3) In conjunction with the meeting of six levels of cadres in the fields, a widespread drought-resistant spring planting inspection, competition, and mass check-up and acceptance work was carried out. During the inspection, both ends were grasped to drive the middle, and when problems were discovered, they were studied and resolved on the spot.

(4) Before and after sowing, a mass debate on sowing technical specifications was launched to unify understanding from top to bottom, left to right, and ensure that all technical aspects were consistent, making drought-resistant spring planting and one-time full seedling emergence a conscious action of the masses.

Currently, over eight million mu of crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, and vegetables have been sown throughout the province, all achieving high standards and excellent quality in sowing.

This dispatch from Nanchang on the 12th reports that Jiangxi's Ganxian County is using fine plowing and harrowing, sufficient base fertilizer, tender and strong seedlings, high-quality transplanting, and reasonable close planting as criteria to improve spring plowing standards and lay a solid foundation for balanced and high yields of early rice.

Ganxian County's spring plowing production campaign is in full swing and has achieved great results. All 410,000 mu of early rice fields in the county have been plowed and harrowed three times, deeply plowing to six to eight inches; an average of 420 dan of standard base fertilizer has been applied per mu. In terms of technical innovation, 259 types of tools have been reformed, over 13,000 pieces have been promoted and used, and over 10,000 skilled operators of rice transplanters have been trained. Over 68,000 mu of seedlings throughout the county, under the careful care of professional teams, are lush and green, reaching four inches in height. Over 10,000 mu have already been transplanted throughout the county, and according to inspections, each field has met the requirements of high standards.

Ganxian County's high standards for spring plowing production are based on the past two years of experience in grain production. Last year, the county sowed 390,000 mu of early rice, and 140,000 mu of three types of seedlings appeared when entering the second weeding. Although 50,000 laborers were organized to carry out three rounds of crash weeding and topdressing, most of the three types of seedlings were upgraded. However, the seedlings were already adversely affected in the early stages. At the same time, the crash elimination of three types of seedlings coincided with the busy season of weeding cash crops, topdressing all early rice fields, weeding, and accumulating fertilizer for late rice, and diverting a large number of people to crash eliminate three types of seedlings affected these production projects. Therefore, while vigorously expanding the area, the county party committee proposed to eliminate the three types of seedlings before transplanting to ensure the realization of large-area balanced and high yields this year. The county party committee first investigated the causes of the three types of seedlings, one being that they appeared in low-yielding fields with poor soil quality and insufficient sunlight, and the other being that there was insufficient base fertilizer, rough plowing and harrowing, weak seedlings, and improper close planting before transplanting. Afterwards, in response to these causes, based on the county's elimination of low-yielding fields last winter and this spring, high standards for spring plowing production were proposed to ensure that the three types of seedlings are eliminated before transplanting.

During the spring plowing campaign, all localities concentrated their efforts to overcome difficulties, eliminate weak links, and strive for all spring plowing production to meet high standards. The county has concentrated 95% of its labor force, or 150,000 male and female commune members, into spring plowing.

While concentrating efforts to carry out spring plowing production, all localities, based on the different production projects and high-standard requirements, and on the basis of dividing professional teams to be responsible, have established a "four-fixed" responsibility system of fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed quality, and fixed rewards and punishments, which has not only strengthened the production responsibility of the commune members, but also encouraged their production enthusiasm. In addition, Party committees at all levels have established spring plowing inspection groups or teams, with major inspections every ten days, minor inspections every week, and production teams checking every day, immediately commending advanced individuals, summarizing experience, and promoting it in an all-round way; and immediately organizing forces to eliminate backward individuals. At the same time, all communes have also established inspection and acceptance systems. After the Maodian Commune implemented the inspection and acceptance system, in order to ensure that the plowing and harrowing work met high standard requirements, the commune members took the initiative to transfer strong plowing cattle and experienced commune members to carry out plowing and harrowing, and supervised each other to ensure quality, and as a result, all 30,000 mu of early rice fields in the commune were plowed five times and harrowed four times, making the fields as smooth as a mirror.

    山东狠抓水肥土，大搞工具配套，训练播种能手
    力争一次播好种一次出全苗
    江西赣县强调做好插秧准备不让早稻出现三类苗
    本报济南12日电　山东各地抗旱春播，誓夺春苗齐全肥壮的斗争，已经紧张热烈地开展起来。中共山东省委号召全党全民继续以抗旱春播、抗旱保麦为压倒一切的中心任务，大干二十天，确保春播作物适时早种，种足、种好，达到一次播种、一次苗全苗壮。
    目前山东旱情严重，干旱已成为适时早播、一次播种达全苗的最大障碍。因此山东人民，决心变坏事为好事，变干旱为动力，大抓狠抓“水”字。现在，投入抗旱春播的劳力已达五百多万人，全省五千五百多万亩春田，有三千六百万亩达到了畦田、园田化、水利化。一千八百多万亩缺水无水的土地，正在大挖地下水，补墒造墒。据不完全统计，最近一个多月已新打机井、砖井四万六千多眼，临时井十五万多眼，挖山泉、闸山沟八千多处，消灭水利死角八百多万亩，灌溉春地七百多万亩。
    水字领先，肥字随后，水、肥、土一起行，消灭白茬下种地块，这又是一次拿全苗的重大措施。因此，一个大积大运肥料，改造坏地、薄地、远地的热潮，也随兴修水利而开展起来。目前春田施上底肥的面积，已占春田总面积的80％左右。许多不易拿苗的盐碱地，都采用蓄水洗碱或放淤压碱、以沙盖碱等办法，加以改造，使大片土地整得细、好、平、实。
    历年经验还证明，一次播好种，一次拿全苗壮苗，是保证全年增产的一个决定性关键。往年，山东省有些地区尽管水、肥、土、种等各项工作都作了充分的准备，但是总有15％至20％的面积缺苗断垅。原因就是没有把播种技术掌握好。今年山东各级党委十分重视播种这一环。许多地区去冬开始就为春播制定了深（深耕）、墒（保墒）、肥（多施细施）、种（良种）、药（药剂拌种）、行（东西行改为南北行）、早（适时早播）等七字，作为保证苗全苗旺的规格。入春以来，各地大量举办专业训练班，训练播种技术人员、扶耧手等一百多万人，训练甘薯育苗技术员十八万九千人。播种开始前，一般做到了“三配套”，一是按方按块确定技术员和播种员，工具、畜力配成套。二是种子处理工序配套，例如棉花种子、选、晒、浸、拌、发芽试验，不漏过一道工序。三是播种规格成套。墒不好，土不细，种子不好，地下虫害防治不好等都可能影响一次全苗。所以在播种规格上，要把权力放给心红手巧的扶耧手掌握。在播种开始时，各地领导干部又亲自动手，三番五次进行试播，召开现场会交流经验，摸清各类土壤、墒情和一次播种、一次全苗壮苗的经验，并且在田间播了大量的“后备苗”，以便移补。
    山东各级党委为了确保一次播好种，一次拿全苗，在领导方法上还采取了四项有效的措施：
    （一）组织省、地、县、公社、大队、小队六级有八十多万干部会师到田，分片包干，与社员同吃同住同劳动，既是指挥员，又是战斗员、技术员。这样大大鼓舞了广大社员的斗志，春播准备工作更加细致、踏实、具体。
    （二）从省到公社，调动工农
  商学兵各部门力量，支援抗旱春播与抗旱保麦斗争。现在，已由各大、中型水利工地抽出一百万人支援抗旱，使生产队保持充足的劳动力。
    （三）结合六级干部会师到田，普遍开展抗旱春播大检查，大评比和群众性的查补、验收工作。检查中抓两头带中间，发现问题，就地研究解决。
    （四）在播种前后，开展一次群众性的播种技术规格大辩论，上下左右统一认识，各项技术一贯到底，抗旱春播，一次全苗成为扩大群众的自觉行动。
    现在，全省播种的粮棉油麻菜等类作物已达八百多万亩，全部实现了播种高标准、优质量。
    本报南昌12日电　江西赣县以犁耙精细、基肥充足、秧苗嫩壮、莳田优质、密植合理为尺度，提高春耕标准，为早稻平衡大增产打下扎扎实实的基础。
    赣县春耕生产运动正在轰轰烈烈地开展，并已取得巨大成绩。全县四十一万亩早稻田已全部经过三犁三耙，深耕六寸至八寸；平均每亩田已施足了四百二十担标准基肥。在技术革新方面，已改革工具二百五十九种，推广使用一万三千多件，训练了操纵插秧机等能手一万多人。全县六万八千多亩秧苗在专业队的精细护养下，一片青葱，高达四寸。全县已经莳田一万多亩，据检查，丘丘达到了高标准的要求。
    赣县春耕生产高标准，是根据过去两年来粮食生产经验提出来的。该县去年播种三十九万亩早稻，在转入第二次耘田时出现了十四万亩三类苗。尽管先后组织五万名劳力进行了三次突击抢耘、抢追肥，使大部分三类苗升了级。但是由于禾苗幼期已经受到不利的影响。同时，在突击消灭三类苗时，正处在经济作物除草、全部早稻田追肥、耘田和为晚稻积造肥料的大忙季节，抽调大批人马突击消灭三类苗后，便影响到了这些生产项目。因此，县委在狠抓扩大面积同时，提出把三类苗消灭在莳田前，以保证实现今年大面积平衡高产。县委首先调查了出现三类苗的原因，一是出现在土质较差、阳光不足的低产田，一是莳田前基肥不足、犁耙粗放、秧苗弱小、密植不当等。之后，针对这些原因，在去冬今春取得全县消灭低产田的基础上，提出了春耕生产高标准要求，以保证把三类苗消灭在莳田前。
    在春耕运动中，各地集中力量攻克难关，消灭薄弱环节，争取各项春耕生产都达到高标准要求。全县已集中了95％的劳力、即十五万名男女社员投入春耕。
    在集中力量开展春耕生产的同时，各地根据各个不同生产项目和高标准要求，在划分专业队负责的基础上，建立了定时间、定数量、定质量、定奖惩的“四定”责任制，这样既加强了社员的生产责任心，又能鼓舞社员的生产积极性。此外，各级党委都成立了春耕检查团或小组，十天一大查、一周一小查，生产小队一天一查，发现先进立即表扬，总结经验推广全面；发现后进立即组织力量突击消灭。同时各公社还建立检查验收制度。茅店公社推行了检查与验收制度后，社员为了使犁耙工夫达到高标准要求，主动抽调强壮耕牛与有经验的社员进行犁耙，并互相督促，保证质量，结果这个社的三万多亩早稻田全部做到了五犁四耙，田平如镜。（附图片）
