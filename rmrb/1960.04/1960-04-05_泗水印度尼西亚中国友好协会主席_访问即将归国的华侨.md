    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 3rd: Suparto, Chairman of the Surabaya Indonesia-China Friendship Association, and others visited overseas Chinese who are about to return to China on the afternoon of March 31st. These overseas Chinese were gathered in three shelters in Surabaya.

    These more than two hundred overseas Chinese came from Malang, Kediri, Tulungagung, and Blitar. They are part of the nearly ten thousand overseas Chinese from these regions who requested to return to China. They lost their livelihoods after Indonesian authorities banned small retailers. These overseas Chinese left Surabaya on April 1st aboard the "Da Bao An" ship.

    When Suparto and others visited these overseas Chinese, they gave them biscuits and other things. Suparto said that he hoped to maintain the friendly relations between Indonesia and China. The association believes that through understanding, the friendly relations between the two countries will be closer.

    The Surabaya organization of the Indonesian Women's Movement Association also sent people to visit these overseas Chinese and presented them with flowers.

    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚泗水印度尼西亚—中国友好协会主席苏帕托等人在3月31日下午访问了集中在泗水三个收容所里的即将回国的华侨。　　这些来自玛琅、谏义里、多隆亚公和勿里达的华侨共有二百多人。他们是这些地区要求回国的将近一万名华侨中的一部分。在印度尼西亚当局禁止小零售商以后，他们失去了谋生之道。这些华侨在4月1日搭乘“大宝安号”离开泗水。
    苏帕托等人在访问这些华侨时，送给他们饼干和其他东西。苏帕托说，他希望继续保持印度尼西亚同中国的友好关系。协会相信，通过谅解，两国的友好关系将会更密切。
    印度尼西亚妇女运动协会在泗水的组织也派人访问了这些华侨，并且向华侨赠送了鲜花。
