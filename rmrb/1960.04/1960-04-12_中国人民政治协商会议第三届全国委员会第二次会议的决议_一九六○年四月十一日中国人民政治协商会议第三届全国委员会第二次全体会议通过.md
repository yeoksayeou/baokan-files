Resolution of the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(Adopted by the Second Plenary Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on April 11, 1960)

The Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference heard the work report delivered by Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong on behalf of the Standing Committee. All members also attended the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, listened to Vice-Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice-Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft," and Vice-Premier Tan Zhenlin's "Striving for the Early Realization of the National Agricultural Development Program," and expressed their firm support. They also heard Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the international situation and China's foreign relations, and expressed their warm support for the government's foreign policy. The 1960 national economic plan is a great plan for continued leap forward. The realization of this plan is of great significance for our future sustained leap forward and for the early construction of our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture. The meeting called on the people of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic people across the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to work together with one heart and one mind, redouble their efforts to implement the resolutions of the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan, and to strive for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program.

In the past year, the Standing Committee has done a lot of work and achieved remarkable results. The current situation in the country is very good: the people of the whole country are striving for a continued great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production with soaring enthusiasm, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts is deepening, the mass movements of technological revolution and cultural revolution are developing vigorously, the rural people's communes are being further consolidated and developed, and people's communes are being established in large numbers in cities across the country. Under such a favorable situation, the meeting believes that the five suggestions for future work put forward by the Standing Committee are timely and correct. These five tasks are: First, to continue to implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties, to promote the democratic parties and democratic personages to actively participate in national political life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and to better serve socialist transformation and socialist construction; Second, to continue to promote people from all walks of life to actively participate in the mass movements of technological revolution, cultural revolution, and increasing production and practicing economy; Third, to strengthen theoretical study and launch a movement to study the works of Chairman Mao Zedong; Fourth, to arrange for members of the conference, members of the central committees of the democratic parties, and democratic personages from all walks of life to participate in physical labor in a planned way; Fifth, to continue to adhere to the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, and to strive for the liberation of Taiwan. The meeting called on all members of the conference to work hard to accomplish these five tasks.

The meeting believes that the conference and its local committees must adapt to the current excellent situation in the country, actively promote the unity and work of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and democratic personages from all walks of life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen study, further develop the role of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, and take practical actions to implement the general line of socialist construction, adhere to the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, hold high the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and forge ahead bravely!
