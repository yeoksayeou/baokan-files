    The Taihang People Rearrange the Mountains and Rivers
    Li Shengwang, Secretary of the CPC Jin Southeast District Committee

    Comrades who have been to the Taihang Mountains in the past have all heard this folk song: "The mountain is like a monk's head, floods flow through the gullies, nine years out of ten are barren, with no reliable source for food and clothing." Indeed, the small-scale peasant economy of the past millennia was helpless in the face of nature. However, the heroic people who had gained control of their own destiny through arduous struggle, following Chairman Mao's kind teaching of "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and inspired by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, embraced the ambition to rearrange the Taihang mountains and rivers and launched a mass movement for large-scale water conservancy construction. After two winters and springs of heroic struggle, 400,000 water conservancy projects have been completed, including 527 reservoirs, 120,000 canals, nearly 200,000 dry wells and ponds, more than 400 high-lift irrigation stations, and more than 40,000 projects for digging springs and intercepting subsurface flows. A total of 400 million cubic meters of water storage has been completed, and the irrigated area in the region has increased from 60,000 mu before liberation to more than 4 million mu, accounting for more than half of the cultivated land area.

    The great leap forward in water conservancy construction has promoted the great development of fish farming, rice cultivation, navigation, power generation, and other undertakings. To date, the region's large and small reservoirs have 8.26 million fish, more than 10,000 geese and ducks. In 1959, more than 8,000 mu of rice were newly developed, with an average yield of more than 600 jin per mu, more than double the yield of other crops. This fact has shattered the old idea that the Taihang Mountains are too high and cold to grow rice.

    Water conservancy construction in the Jin Southeast District has now entered a new stage of comprehensive utilization and high-standard water management. This means that rivers should be navigable, water should be used for power generation, reservoirs should be used for fish farming, and water reservoir factories should be set up everywhere.

    The new stage of water conservancy construction has three characteristics:

    First, the transition from small-scale water conservancy projects run by the communes in the past to people's communes running both small-scale projects and large and medium-sized projects. For example, the Gaoping People's Commune in Jincheng County built 38 medium and small-sized reservoirs last year in one go, including six medium-sized reservoirs with a storage capacity of 3 million to 20 million cubic meters; it expanded the irrigated area by 200,000 mu. Together with the existing foundation, more than 70% of the commune's land has become irrigated land. These six large reservoirs block six large rivers and more than 30 small rivers. The construction of the six large reservoirs required an investment of more than 3.4 million yuan. Of course, it is difficult for a commune to run so many and such large projects. However, instead of asking the state for money, they relied on the superiority of the people's communes, being large in size and having a high degree of public ownership, and relied on their own efforts to build the reservoirs. They achieved self-sufficiency in funding, self-smelting of pig iron, self-burning of lime, self-manufacturing of cement, self-felling of timber, self-mixing of explosives, self-making of tools, and self-learning of technology. All kinds of difficulties were solved one by one by themselves. Now most of the project has been completed, and they have begun to use reservoir water for spring irrigation to combat drought.

    The Jin Southeast District Committee of the Communist Party of China promoted the experience of the Gaoping Commune in building reservoirs throughout the district, and promoted the spirit of self-reliance. The district has established a total of 18 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, requiring a total investment of 32.8 million yuan, of which the state subsidized more than 9 million yuan, and two-thirds of the funds were solved by the communes themselves. The Zhangze Reservoir in the Shangdang Basin, which has a water storage capacity of nearly 200 million cubic meters and an investment of 8.5 million yuan, was also invested only 2 million yuan by the state, and the rest was solved by the masses themselves. As for general small-scale water conservancy projects, they are all solved by the masses themselves. The fact that the masses are carrying out large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in large numbers fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes.

    Second, implement high-standard comprehensive water use. Qin County is a model in this regard. Qin County concentrated more than 30,000 people to make a big effort to create a hundred-mile artificial lake. In one winter and one spring, nine large dams and twelve small dams were built on the banks of the Zhang River, which stretches for more than a hundred miles. By means of building dams in sections, intercepting water in sections, and developing in stages, the appearance of the Zhang River within Qin County changed rapidly, achieving "blocking the Zhang River, preventing water from leaving the county." This artificial lake and the five major backbone reservoirs built in the past two years, such as the Geluhe River, Yingchun River, and Zhangyuan River, are connected through rivers, forming a comprehensive water management and water use project that transforms mountain valleys into reservoirs, channels everywhere, irrigation through gravity flow, and cultivated land into garden fields, presenting a moving picture to the mountain people.

    Under the influence of Qin County, Xiangyuan County is also planning to build a hundred-mile artificial lake. Pingshun County, which is known as lacking all five elements, is making a big effort to develop the main stream of the Zhuozhang River in six stages, building power stations at every level, and using electricity everywhere to pump water for irrigation, so that more than 100,000 mu of terraced fields in the county can be irrigated. After the Houbi Power Station, which is under construction, is completed, it will enable the 130,000 people in Pingshun County to initially achieve electrification. The hydropower station built by Qinyuan County on the banks of the Qin River has installed steel mills and processing plants, using electricity instead of labor and animal power for processing, with an annual income of more than 60,000 yuan, and can also irrigate 35 million mu of land. This event caused a sensation among the people of the county and launched a mass movement for comprehensive water use and large-scale construction of hydroelectric power stations. The county plans to build 100 hydroelectric power stations before National Day this year. They adopted the method of concentrating efforts and completing projects in sets, and built 12 hydroelectric power stations in one month, which have already begun to generate electricity. More than 30 others have also started construction.

    In the Jin Southeast District, a total of 1,400 hydropower stations and 43 power stations have been built, with a generating capacity of 1,296 kilowatts, using different drops in reservoirs, canals, and rivers.

    Comprehensive water management and full utilization of water energy have found new ways to liberate rural labor, change the appearance of rural areas, and use hydropower to replace human and animal power. For example, the Tunjiang Reservoir has built four power stations and four processing plants, processing more than 30,000 jin of grain per day. The daily working efficiency of the four power stations can replace 300 laborers and 150 animal power. Comprehensive water use has played a huge role in improving agricultural production.

    Third, the large-scale construction of thousands of reservoirs and ten thousand channels is combined with complete sets of equipment, so that the water conservancy and irrigation projects in the Taihang Mountains have initially formed a new irrigation system. The method of complete sets of equipment is: vigorously promote the combination of mass movements, that is, the combination of building reservoirs and repairing canals, the combination of repairing canals and leveling land, the combination of leveling land and building high-yield squares, the combination of backbone projects and medium and small-sized projects, and the combination of using drainage and irrigation machinery and repairing supporting facilities. As a result of this movement, a new situation of reservoirs in groups, canals in networks, wells in rows, and garden fields in squares has emerged on the Taihang Mountains, on the banks of the Zhangdan River, and in the Shangdang Luze Basin. To date, more than 77,000 newly built water conservancy projects have been completed in the region, expanding the irrigated area by 1.08 million mu. It is expected that another 730,000 mu can be completed before sowing. Two hundred and thirty old reservoirs have been equipped with complete sets of equipment after adding dams and canals; two hundred and eighty-nine newly built reservoirs have achieved reservoir completion and canal connection; and more than 3 million mu of land have been carefully leveled and refined, realizing the garden field high-yield square.

    The three million people of Jin Southeast are gradually turning the beautiful wish of making the Taihang Mountains catch up with the Jiangnan region into a reality.

    太行人民重新安排山河	中共晋东南地委书记　李生旺
    过去到过太行山的同志，都听到过这一首民歌：“山上和尚头，沟洼洪水流，十年九不收，吃穿没靠头”。的确，几千年来的小农经济，在大自然面前是无能为力的。但是，经过艰苦斗争掌握了自己命运的英雄人民，遵循毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的亲切教导，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，人们抱着重新安排太行河山的雄心壮志，开展了大兴水利建设的群众运动。经过两个冬春的英勇奋战，已完成各项水利工程四十万件，其中水库五百二十七座，水渠十二万条，旱井池塘近二十万处，高灌站四百多处，挖泉水、截潜流等工程四万多项。总共完成蓄水量四亿公方，全区灌溉面积由解放前六万亩发展到四百多万亩，占到耕地面积一半以上。
    水利建设大跃进，促进了养鱼、种稻、航运、发电等事业的大发展。到目前为止，全区大小水库养鱼八百二十六万尾，鹅鸭一万多只，1959年新发展水稻八千多亩，每亩平均收获六百多斤，超过其它作物产量一倍以上。这个事实打破了以往认为太行山气候高寒不能种稻的旧想法。
    晋东南区的水利建设，现在跨进了一个综合利用，高标准治水的新阶段。这就是：河要通航，水要发电，库要养鱼，处处要大办水库工厂。
    水利建设的新阶段，有三个特点：
    第一，由过去的社办小型水利，过渡到人民公社既办小型工程，又办大、中型工程。如晋城县高平人民公社，去年一举建成三十八座中小型水库，其中包括蓄水三百万方到两千万方的中型水库六座；扩大水地二十万亩，加上原有基础，全社70％以上的土地变成了水浇地。这六大水库拦断了六条大河，三十多条小河。六大水库的修建，需要投资三百四十多万元。当然，一个公社办这样多、这样大的工程，是有困难的。但他们并没有伸手向国家要钱，而是依靠人民公社一大二公的优越性，自力更生，自办水库。做到了经费自筹，生铁自炼，石灰自烧，水泥自造，木料自伐，炸药自配，工具自作，技术自学，各种困难都靠自己逐一解决。现在工程已大部竣工，开始利用库水春浇抗旱。
    晋东南地委在全区推广了高平公社办水库的经验，大兴自力更生之风。全区共举办了十八项大、中型水利工程，共需投资三千二百八十万元，其中国家补助了九百多万元，三分之二的资金是公社自行解决的。上党盆地蓄水近两亿方、投资八百五十万元的漳泽大水库，也只由国家投资二百万元，其余都是群众自己解决的。至于一般小型水利工程，都是依靠群众自己解决的。群众大量举办大中型水利工程，充分说明了人民公社的无比优越性。
    第二，实行高标准综合用水。沁县在这方面是一个典范。沁县集中三万多人大闹百里人工湖，一冬一春在长达百余里的漳河滩上，建大坝九座，小坝十二座，用分段筑坝、节节拦水、阶梯开发的办法，使沁县境内的漳河面貌迅速改变，做到了“拦断漳河，水不出县”。这个人工湖和近两年新建的圪芦河、迎春河、漳沅等五大骨干水库，通过河流串连起来，形成了山谷水库化、遍地渠道化、灌溉自流化、耕地园田化的全面治水、用水的综合工程，给山区人民展现了一幅动人的景象。
    在沁县的影响下，襄垣县也正在筹建百里人工湖。号称五行具缺的平顺县，大闹浊漳河干流，实现六级阶梯开发，节节造电站，处处用电力抽水灌溉，使该县十余万亩梯田实现水利化。正在动工的侯壁电站建成后，可使十三万人口的平顺县初步实现电气化。沁源县在沁河岸上建成的水电站，安起了钢磨，办起了加工厂，用电力代替劳畜力加工，年收入六万余元，还能浇地三千五百万亩。这一事例轰动了全县人民，掀起了群众性的综合用水，大办水力发电站运动。全县计划在今年国庆节前，兴办一百座水力发电站。他们采取集中突击，成套竣工的办法，一个月建成水电站十二处，并已开始发电。其它还有三十多处也已动工。
    晋东南专区在水利建设中，共利用水库、渠道、河流等不同落差，建成水力站一千四百处，发电站四十三处，发电量一千二百九十六瓩。
    综合治水，充分利用水能，对解放农村劳动力，改变农村面貌，用水力代替人、畜力找到了新的途径。如屯绛水库建成电站四处，办起四处加工厂，日加工粮食三万斤以上，四个动力站每天工作效率，可代替三百个劳力和一百五十头畜力。综合用水，对提高农业生产起了巨大作用。
    第三，大建千库万渠与成龙配套结合，使太行山区的水利灌溉工程，初步形成了一个新的灌溉体系。成龙配套的办法是：大搞结合群众运动，即建库与修渠结合，修渠与整地结合，整地与建丰产方结合，骨干工程与中、小型工程结合，使用排灌机械与修理配套结合。开展这一运动的结果，使太行山上、漳丹河畔、上党潞泽盆地展现出水库成群，水渠成网，水井成排，园田成方的新局面。到目前为止，全区新建的水利工程已完成七万七千多项，扩大灌溉面积一百零八万亩，预计在播种前还可完成七十三万亩。有二百三十个旧有水库，经过加坝加渠，配成了套；新建的二百八十九个水库，做到了库成渠通；有三百多万亩土地经过细整细平，实现了园田化丰产方。
    晋东南的三百万人民使太行山区赶江南这一美好愿望将逐步变为现实。
