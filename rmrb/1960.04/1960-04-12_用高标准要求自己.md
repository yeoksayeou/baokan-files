    Holding Oneself to High Standards
    Yao Renwei
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company gained many valuable experiences in completing its first quarter production plan ahead of schedule. One of these was that they compared their own achievements with the outstanding achievements of steel enterprises across the country and diligently studied their advanced experiences, thereby establishing a high standard for themselves and constantly holding themselves to that standard.
    Holding oneself to high standards is the attitude of a promoter. Striving to improve technical operation skills, diligently learning advanced experiences, and constantly holding oneself to high standards is an important guarantee for completing all our undertakings.
    As I write this, I am reminded of a small story about Li Guang, the "Flying General" of the Han Dynasty: Once, he went out hunting and saw a stone in the grass from a distance, mistaking it for a tiger. He shot an arrow, and the arrowhead went all the way in. When he went over to look, he realized it was a hard stone and felt strange. He shot several more arrows in succession, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shoot them in. The first arrow "penetrated the stone completely," but the subsequent arrows couldn't penetrate. This is not surprising. The problem was that he initially mistook the stone for a tiger, and with a formidable enemy in front of him, he had to concentrate and exert all his strength in one go, naturally hitting the target with one shot. Later, when he saw it was a stone, he lacked the concept of an enemy situation and could no longer treat it as a real tiger. He became careless, his mind was not focused, and of course, his strength was insufficient. We can learn something from this: establishing a high standard for oneself can make oneself feel like a hero against ten thousand, going all out. Gorky said: "The higher a person's goal, the faster his talent develops, and the more effective he is for society." This all illustrates the importance of setting high standards. Do you want to generate tremendous power? Then you must set a lofty goal for yourself. This way, you can also have a broad vision, be encouraged, and draw strength. The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results points out the great goal for us and is a brilliant path for fully developing man's subjective initiative.
    "A journey of a hundred li is only ninety when you stop." Without strong will and a spirit of perseverance, one will "return empty-handed from a mountain of treasure."
    Every promoter, every true revolutionary, should have the great ambition to "compete with the heavens," should have the fearless spirit that "no height is unattainable," and should have the continuous revolutionary thought of going all out and aiming high.

### 用高标准要求自己

    用高标准要求自己	姚人为
    石景山钢铁公司在提前完成首季生产计划中有很多宝贵的经验，其中有一条是，他们把全国钢铁企业的出色成绩拿来跟自己比较，并且认真学习人家的先进经验，从而在自己面前树立一个高标准，时时刻刻以这个标准来要求自己。
    用高标准要求自己，这是促进派的态度。要努力提高技术操作水平，认真学习先进经验，时时刻刻用高标准来要求自己，这是完成我们一切事业的重要保证。
    写到这里，我想起了汉朝“飞将军”李广的一个小故事：有一次他出外打猎，远远望见草丛里一块石头，错认做一只老虎，一箭射去，箭头全钻了进去，走过去一看，才知道是块硬石头，自己也觉得奇怪。接连又射了几箭，却无论怎样也射不进去了。第一箭“中石没镞”，以后几箭就再也射不进去了。其实不足为奇，问题就在他起初把石头错认做一只老虎，大敌当前，于是不得不聚精会神，一鼓作气，自然一发而中；后来他一看是石头，便缺乏敌情观念，再也不能当真老虎打，一轻敌，心不专，当然力也就不足了。从这里可以得到一点启发：在自己面前树立高标准，就能使自己心雄万夫，全力以赴。高尔基说过：“一个人努力的目标越高，他的才力就发展得越快，对于社会就更有效果。”这都说明树立高标准的重要。你要产生巨大的力量么，那你就得为自己立下一个远大的目标。这样你也就能够高瞻远瞩，得到鼓舞，汲取力量。党提出鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，就是为我们指出了伟大的目标，并且可以充分发挥人的主观能动作用的光辉道路。
    “人行百里，止于九十”，没有坚强意志和坚持到底的精神，是会“宝山空归”的。
    每一个促进派，每一个真正的革命者，都应该有“欲与天公试比高”的伟大胸襟，应该有“无高不可攀”的大无畏精神，应该有鼓足干劲、力争上游的不断革命思想。
