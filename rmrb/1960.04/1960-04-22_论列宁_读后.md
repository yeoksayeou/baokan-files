    On Reading "On Lenin"
    Xie Ning

    N.K. Krupskaya wrote a systematic "Reminiscences of Lenin" after Lenin's death. In addition, she also wrote many articles and gave many reports on Lenin's life, career, and thought. These articles and reports constitute the content of the book "On Lenin." As an eyewitness and direct participant in the events described in the book, the author's work is one of the most reliable sources of information about Lenin's life and activities.

    Krupskaya describes all aspects of Lenin's life, thought, and work in this book. What is most impressive after reading this book is Lenin's spirit of selflessness, impartiality, and tireless struggle for the great cause of the proletariat and the ideals of communism. In Lenin's view, being a fighter for the cause of the workers was the greatest happiness. At any time and in any place, Lenin's thoughts and actions were all about the cause of the working class.

    As a student, in order to train himself to be a revolutionary, Lenin seized every free moment to read books about the struggle of the working class and revolution. At that time, he loved ice skating very much, but in order to train himself to be a revolutionary, he gave up ice skating. He was very interested in Latin, but in order to train himself to be a revolutionary, he gave up studying Latin.

    In order to get close to the workers and promote Marxism to them, he worked hard to learn the language of the workers. Lenin once wrote to Plekhanov, "My greatest hope and most frequent fantasy is to be able to write for the workers." It was precisely because Lenin had put in such hard work that he became working class in everything from his thoughts and feelings to his language. Therefore, when he spoke among the working masses, the workers said, "He is one of our own."

    Even in prison and in exile, he never stopped fighting for the ideals of communism for a single moment. His "Draft Program of the Social Democratic Party and Its Explanation" was written in milk in the Peterburg prison, and "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" was written in exile in Siberia.

    After the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, because almost all the representatives were arrested immediately after the meeting, a unified party was still not established. In order to start a secretly published newspaper to unite the party, Lenin had to go abroad. But how painful was life in exile abroad for Lenin! But for the sake of the proletariat's cause, Lenin endured this pain.

    Lenin was constantly considering the various issues of the proletarian revolution, and even when he was sick, he did not let his brain rest properly. "His brain was always working hard. I (Krupskaya) remember that when the last fatal illness attacked him, the doctor prescribed a strict regimen, instructing him to lie down for two hours after lunch. Ilyich followed the regimen, but he was skeptical of the doctor's requirements, and he once said: 'They can't stop me from thinking about problems.' Indeed, whether he was lying in bed, walking, or discussing simple daily life problems, he was tirelessly considering the cause he had devoted his life to, and he gave all his strength and every minute of his life to this cause." (Pages 50-51)

    The life of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin will forever radiate light, inspiring us to move forward. From this book, we can once again feel the illumination of this light and gain the strength to move forward continuously.

    “论列宁”读后
    谢宁
    娜·康·克鲁普斯卡娅在列宁逝世后，写了系统的“列宁回忆录”。此外，她还写了许多有关列宁的生平事业和思想的文章，作过这方面的许多报告。这些文章和报告就是“论列宁”一书的内容。作者是本书中所述事件的目睹者和直接参加者，她的著作是有关列宁的生活和活动的最可靠的资料之一。
    克鲁普斯卡娅在这本书里描写了列宁的生活、思想、工作的各个方面。读了这本书以后，印象最深的是列宁那种毫无私心、毫无偏见、不倦地为无产阶级的伟大事业、为共产主义的理想奋斗的精神。在列宁看来，做一个为工人事业奋斗的战士是最大的幸福。无论在什么时候，无论在什么地方，列宁所想的、所做的，无一不是工人阶级的事业。
    还在学生时代，列宁为了要把自己锻炼成革命家，就抓紧一分一秒的空闲时间去阅读有关工人阶级斗争、有关革命的书籍。那时他是非常爱滑冰的，为了要把自己锻炼成革命家，他放弃了滑冰，他对拉丁文很有兴趣，为了要把自己锻炼成革命家，他放弃了拉丁文的学习。
    他为了接近工人，向工人宣传马克思主义，曾下过苦工学习工人的语言。列宁曾写信给普列汉诺夫说：“我最大的希望和幻想得最多的就是能够为工人写作。”正因为列宁下过这样的苦工夫，他从思想感情一直到语言都工人阶级化了。所以他在工人群众中讲话时，工人都说：“这是我们自己人。”
    他就是在监狱中，在流放地也没有一分钟不在为共产主义的理想奋斗。他的“社会民主党纲领草案及其说明”是在彼得堡的监狱里用牛奶写成的，“俄国资本主义的发展”是在西伯利亚流放地写成的。
    在俄国社会民主工党第一次代表大会后，由于几乎所有的代表都在会后立刻被捕，统一的党还是没有建立起来。列宁为了要创办一个秘密出版的报纸把党团结起来，他不得不到国外去。可是流亡国外的生活对列宁来说是多么痛苦！但是为了无产阶级的事业列宁忍受了这种痛苦。
    列宁是无时无刻不在考虑无产阶级革命的种种问题的，就是在病中他也没有让自己的脑子好好地休息过。“他的脑子始终都在紧张地工作。我（克鲁普斯卡娅）记得，当最后一次致命的疾病向他侵袭的时候，医生给他规定了严格的制度，嘱咐他午饭后躺两小时。伊里奇是遵守制度的，但是他对医生的要求抱着怀疑的态度，他有一次这样说：‘他们无法叫我不想问题。’的确，不论是躺在床上，散步或谈论简单的日常生活上的问题时，他总是不倦地考虑着他毕生所从事的事业，他为这一事业付出了自己的一切力量、自己一生的每一分钟。”（第50—51页）
    伟大的革命导师列宁的一生，永远放射出光芒，鼓舞我们前进。从这本书里，我们又能感受到这种光芒的照耀，得到不断前进的力量。
