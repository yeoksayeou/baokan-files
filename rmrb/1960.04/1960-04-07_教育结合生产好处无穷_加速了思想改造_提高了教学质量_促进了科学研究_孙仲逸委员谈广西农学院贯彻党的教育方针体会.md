Chairman, fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly endorse the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, as well as the report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the report on the 1959 state final accounts and the draft state budget for 1960 by Vice Premier Li Xiannian at the National People's Congress. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and all departments should support it to accelerate agricultural development. As a worker in agricultural education and agricultural science, I am greatly encouraged by this and will resolutely respond to this great call. Now, I would like to report to you on some of the experiences of Guangxi Agricultural College, where I work, in implementing the Party's education policy during the Great Leap Forward, as well as my personal shallow understanding of this, and ask for your corrections.

Since 1958, when agricultural colleges and universities across the country implemented the Party's education policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and sent teachers and students to the people's communes for training, the political consciousness of teachers and students and the integration of theory with practice have made significant progress in all aspects. This has changed the old bourgeois educational outlook of being divorced from production and reality, and embodies the great victory of the Party's education policy. This iron fact has greatly educated bourgeois intellectuals, making them deeply realize that: approaching the working people and engaging in physical labor is an effective way to transform intellectuals; linking with production practice can indeed improve teaching quality; and only by facing production can scientific research be carried out in a faster, better, and more economical way and achieve success.

Under the leadership of the Party, Guangxi Agricultural College, like other institutions of higher learning, steadfastly implemented the Party's education policy. In the autumn of 1958, it sent some teachers, staff, and students (119 faculty and staff members, and 570 students) to five people's communes in different regions. During the period of being sent down, teachers, students, cadres, and peasants shared three things together (eating, living, and working), which greatly improved their political awareness. More than 90% of them were rated as red banner pacesetters, among which 81 were rated as labor models and meritorious workers at the county and commune level, 100 were rated as various activists, and 2,641 were commended. At the same time, they established a deep affection with the peasant masses. When they were about to separate, they were reluctant to part with each other, and even saw them off with tears. The peasants also gave their beloved things to the students. For example, an 80-year-old grandmother in the Hongqi People's Commune in Liujiang County gave a jade bracelet, which she had treasured for more than 60 years, to a female student. The teachers and students also participated in the rectification of the commune, realized the Party's class line in the countryside, and learned the skills of doing mass work. They basically established a labor viewpoint and a mass viewpoint, and were more profoundly educated in class and improved their ability to analyze classes.

In the countryside, teachers and students also learned practical industrial and agricultural skills. They worked with commune cadres and peasants to carry out scientific research and conduct 442 large and small experiments. Through labor, investigation, and visits, they wrote a total of 2,189 summaries and reports. While learning from the peasants as teachers, they jointly carried out technical reforms and spread scientific culture with them, thus creating and improving 11 tools, opening 19 factories, and co-organizing red-expert schools and spare-time technical training classes, cultivating a total of 3,287 talents of various types.

Combined with intensive productive labor, teaching activities were also carried out, with 528 on-site and classroom teaching sessions, 450 old peasant forums, and the collection and production of 7,403 animal and plant specimens, and the compilation of more than 840,000 words of teaching materials. Due to the combination of theory and practice, teachers improved teaching content and teaching methods, students developed independent thinking and independent work ability, and especially consolidated their professional ideology, recognizing the importance of agricultural production in the national economy. All these changes were more fully reflected in the examination results of the two semesters after returning to school. The results of the final examination last winter were even more prominent. Under the Party Committee's strengthening of ideological leadership over the examination, teachers and students all put politics in command and realized the importance of the examination. Before the examination, teachers enthusiastically tutored and took full responsibility, and students carefully reviewed and worked hard. As a result, the examination results were higher than any previous period, with students obtaining excellent results accounting for 83.8% (67.2% in the second semester of the 1956-1957 academic year, and 76.2% in the second semester of the 1958-1959 academic year). Only 1.2% of the students failed (5.7% in the second semester of the 1956-1957 academic year, and 1.6% in the second semester of the 1958-1959 academic year). Eighteen out of the 39 classes in the whole college eliminated the phenomenon of failing grades. This once again powerfully shows that: through productive labor and the integration of theory with practice, teaching quality is not reduced but has been significantly improved.

In 1960, the sustained leap forward of our national economy has entered a new period, and technical revolution and technical innovation have been raised to an extremely important position. This requires accelerating the training of both red and expert scientific and technical cadres and carrying out mass movements to develop scientific research. In order to ensure the victorious realization of agricultural production, the Party instructed: while giving play to the superiority of the people's communes, it is necessary to grasp agricultural technical transformation, continue to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and implement the forty articles of the agricultural development program. At present, the people's communes across the country are universally carrying out experimental research, and most of them have established their own experimental stations or scientific groups, which urgently need science and technology. Therefore, agricultural scientific research institutions must be combined with the mass production movements such as the research and experimental stations of rural people's communes to form a massive scientific research network, and use the "walking on two legs" policy to accelerate the improvement of agricultural production technology. From this point of view, agricultural colleges and universities should also lose no time in coordinating scientific research with the people's communes to support agricultural production.

From the above-mentioned experiences and the requirements of the new situation, it seems that agricultural colleges and universities, combined with the people's communes, carrying out teaching, productive labor and scientific research, on the one hand, improving the quality of education, on the other hand, supporting agricultural production, is indeed a new direction of work under the three banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes. Therefore, the Party Committee of Guangxi Agricultural College made a timely decision to continue to send some teachers and students to the people's communes after the Spring Festival this year. First, the teachers and students of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department were sent to the Qunying People's Commune in Ningming County to jointly establish a 10,000-head pig farm, and a batch of fine breeds of livestock and crop seeds were donated. Then, more than 20 teachers from the Agronomy Department, the Plant Protection Department and the Agricultural Machinery Department were sent to the commune for a long time to jointly carry out scientific research. The secretary of the commune Party Committee and the commune cadres came to the Agricultural College to express their warm welcome. Subsequently, taking advantage of the opportunity to guide the sent-down teachers and students, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Agricultural College also went to the commune to jointly discuss specific cooperation and further consolidate the cooperation base. We must, under the correct leadership of the Party, actively give play to the role of the cooperation base, improve the quality of education, do a good job in scientific research, and respond to the Party's call to "regard supporting agriculture as our important task."

    教育结合生产好处无穷
    加速了思想改造　提高了教学质量　促进了科学研究
    孙仲逸委员谈广西农学院贯彻党的教育方针体会主席，各位委员：
    陈叔通副主席所作的全国政协常务委员会工作报告和全国人民代表大会上李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告及李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，我表示衷心拥护。李富春副总理指出，农业是国民经济的基础，各部门应予支援，加速农业的发展。我是农业教育和农业科学工作者，听到之后，受到极大的鼓舞，要坚决响应这一伟大号召。现在我想把我工作岗位所在的广西农学院，在大跃进中，贯彻党的教育方针的一点经验和我个人在这方面的肤浅体会，向大家汇报，并请多予指正。
    自从1958年全国农业院校贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，以及下放师生到人民公社，进行锻炼以来，师生的政治觉悟和理论联系实际，都全面地获得了显著进步，从而改变了资产阶级脱离生产、脱离实际的旧教育面貌，体现了党的教育方针的伟大胜利。这一铁的事实，大大地教育了资产阶级知识分子，使他们深深地体会到：接近劳动人民，进行体力劳动，是改造知识分子的有效途径；联系生产实际，确实能提高教学质量；面向生产，科学研究也才能多快好省地开展而获得成就。
    广西农学院，在党的领导下，和其他高等学校一样，坚定不移地贯彻党的教育方针。于1958年秋把部分教师、职员、学生（教职员一百一十九人、学生五百七十人）下放到不同地区的五个人民公社。在下放期间，师生干部和农民三同（同吃、同住、同劳动），大大地提高了政治觉悟。他们90％以上被评为红旗手，其中评为县、社劳动模范和功臣的有八十一人，评为各种积极分子的有一百人，得到表扬的有二千六百四十一人次。同时和农民群众建立了深厚感情。临分别时，彼此依依难舍，以至涕泣相送。农民并把他们心爱的东西赠给学生，像柳江县红旗人民公社有位八十多岁的老奶奶，把珍藏六十多年的玉环送给一个女生。师生们还参加了整社工作，认识到党的农村阶级路线和学到做群众工作的本领。基本上树立了劳动观点和群众观点，更受到深刻的阶级教育和提高阶级分析能力。
    在农村中，师生也学会了工农业实际技能。他们和社干、农民一道大搞科学研究，进行大小试验四百四十二项。通过劳动、调查、访问，写出总结和报告共二千一百八十九篇。在拜农民为师的同时，和他们共同进行技术改革和传播科学文化，因而创造和改良工具十一件，开办工厂十九个，又协办红专学校和业余技术训练班，共培养各种人才三千二百八十七人。
    结合紧张的生产劳动，还展开教学活动，进行现场教学和课堂教学五百二十八次，召开老农座谈会四百五十次，收集和制作动植物标本七千四百零三件，编写教材讲义八十四万多字。由于理论与实际相结合，教师改进了教学内容和教学方法，学生养成了独立思考和独立工作能力，尤其巩固了专业思想，认识到农业生产在国民经济中的重要性。这一切转变，更充分反映到返校后两学期的考试成绩上。去冬期终考试成绩表现更为突出。在党委对考试加强思想领导下，师生人人政治挂帅，认识到考试的重要意义。考试前，教师热心辅导，全面负责，学生认真复习，刻苦钻研。结果，考试成绩高出过去任何时期，学生获得优良成绩的占83.8％（1956至1957学年第二学期占67.2％，1958至1959学年第二学期占76.2％。）个别的班还达到90％以上。成绩不及格的只占1.2％（1956至1957学年第二学期占5.7％，1958至1959学年第二学期占1.6％）。全院三十九班中有十八班消灭不及格现象。这又一次有力地说明了：通过生产劳动、理论联系实际，教学质量不是降低而是有了显著的提高。
    在1960年我国国民经济的持续跃进进入了新的时期，技术革命和技术革新提到极端重要的地位。这样，就要求加速培养又红又专的科学技术干部和大搞群众运动，展开科学研究。为了保证农业生产胜利的实现，党指示：在发挥人民公社优越性的同时，要抓紧农业技术改造，继续执行农业“八字宪法”，实行农业发展纲要四十条。目前全国人民公社普遍展开试验研究，多已建立起自己的试验站或科学小组，迫切需要科学技术。因此，农业科学研究机构必须与农村人民公社研究试验站场等群众性生产运动结合起来，形成声势浩大的科学研究网，用“两条腿走路”的方针，加速提高农业生产技术。这样看来，农业院校亦应刻不容缓地把科学研究配合人民公社进行，以支援农业生产。
    从上所讲的经验和新的形势要求来看，农业院校与人民公社结合起来，进行教学、生产劳动和科学研究，一面提高教育质量，一面支援农业生产，确是在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面旗帜下一个新的工作方向。因此，广西农学院的党委及时作出决定，于今年春节后继续下放部分师生到人民公社。首先下放畜牧兽医系师生到宁明县群英人民公社，协同建立万头猪场，并赠送一批优良种畜和作物种子。接着又下放农学系、植物保护系和农业机械系教师二十余人，长期驻社，协同进行科学研究，该社党委书记和社干曾来到农学院表示热烈欢迎。随后，趁指导下放师生之便，农学院党委书记亦前往该社，共商具体协作，进一步巩固协作基地。我们一定要在党的正确领导下，积极地发挥协作基地的作用，提高教育质量，做好科学研究，响应党的号召，“把支援农业当作自己的重要任务”。
