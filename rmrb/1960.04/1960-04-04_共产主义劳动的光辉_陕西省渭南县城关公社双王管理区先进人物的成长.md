    The Glory of Communist Labor
    The Growth of Advanced Figures in Shuangwang Management Area, Chengguan Commune, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province
    Lin Mu, Mao Wei

    “Heroes gather in Shuangwang Township, every kind of work has a Shuangwang: Qiuxiang is a Cotton King of beauty and talent, Shuxian and Xijie are Grain Kings, Hengjie and Jiejie are Tool Kings, more than five hundred Red Banner hands, fame is spread throughout eight hundred *li* of Qin Chuan.”

    This is a moving song sung by the masses in Shuangwang Management Area (formerly Shuangwang Township) praising the achievements of the labor competition. It is also a true reflection of the vigorous leap forward situation here.

    Shuangwang Management Area is a red banner on the agricultural front in carrying out labor competitions. Its most prominent features are: competition becomes a habit, cooperation becomes a style, heroes emerge in groups, experience becomes systematic, and communist labor shines brightly. Here, there is Zhang Qiuxiang, a farmer scientist and cotton-growing expert, and her outstanding student, Xue Junxiu; there is Liu Hengjie, a nationally renowned tool reform expert, and his close comrade-in-arms, Liu Jiejie; there are Liu Shuxian and Liu Xijie, labor models who have created high-yield records for wheat and corn for many years; and there is Li Baocheng, a pig-raising model, and more than five hundred and sixty advanced producers who emerged in the labor competition. This number accounts for 5% of the total population of the entire management area and 12% of the total labor force. Here, there is a complete set of cotton planting experience, and the province's highest cotton yield record of 3,104 *jin* of seed cotton per *mu* was created; there is a complete set of high-yield wheat and corn experience, and the province's highest corn yield record of 2,627 *jin* of corn per *mu* and a high-yield wheat record of 1,806 *jin* of wheat per *mu* were created. Here, since 1958, a total of more than 100 kinds of tools have been created, imitated, and improved, and more than 100,000 pieces have been popularized. From cultivation, water conservancy, and transportation to cooking, feeding, and processing, all aspects have been systematically integrated. Here, everything is truly advanced, and every line of work produces a champion.

		Advanced Experience Blossoms Fully

    The labor competition in Shuangwang Management Area has gradually developed in line with the pace of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. It has entered an advanced stage with the realization of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes. It is a product of large-scale collective production and the continuously rising socialist and communist spirit of the broad masses. The correct leadership and long-term cultivation by the Party is the fundamental guarantee and decisive factor for promoting the victorious development of the labor competition.

    Since the launch of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in 1952, the former Shuangwang Township has been a key unit cultivated by the Weinan County Party organization. In 1955, the high-yield record of 1,225 *jin* of seed cotton per *mu* cultivated by Zhang Qiuxiang appeared here. In 1956, the high-yield record of 1,102 *jin* of wheat per *mu* cultivated by Liu Shuxian appeared. This was the first triumphant song of Liu Shuxian and Zhang Qiuxiang learning from advanced producers Shi Anfu and Qu Yaoli. In order to promote the high-yield experience of Liu Shuxian and Zhang Qiuxiang and raise the broad masses to the level of advanced producers, at the beginning of 1956, the Shuangwang Township Party General Branch, on the one hand, put forward the slogan "Everyone learns from Shuxian, everyone learns from Qiuxiang" to the masses; on the other hand, it put forward the task of taking apprentices to advanced figures and continuously expanding the ranks of advanced producers.

    The mass movement of learning from the advanced initially manifested itself as a new ideological struggle. Some people said that high yields were just bragging; some people said that Shuxian and Qiuxiang were "capable people" and that they could do it, but others could not. The three types of people—those who agreed with the advanced experience, those who doubted it, and those who opposed it—were all expanding their positions. Who would take the lead in this struggle and open up the situation for learning from the advanced? The Party General Branch proposed that each Party member cultivate one *mu* of high-yield field and that every cadre cultivate high-yield land. At that time, Yang Wenhuan, the secretary of the Party General Branch, and Wang Changli, the township head, also took the lead in cultivating one *mu* of cotton experimental field and learned cotton planting experience from Zhang Qiuxiang. When Party members and cadres took the lead, the masses followed. Then, the Party General Branch organized advanced figures to give lectures in various teams, introducing their experience and the struggle process of creating high-yield records, and spreading the seeds of advanced experience throughout the township. By 1957, there were seventy-five "Qiuxiang Groups" distributed in various production teams. By the beginning of 1958, more than 100 people had been rewarded at the 10,000-person grain and cotton mobilization meeting for their achievements in learning from the advanced.

    After the establishment of the People's Commune, large-scale collective production and the great upsurge of the communist ideology of the people created more favorable conditions for the movement of learning from the advanced. The Party organization also put forward the "Five Hundreds" plan of cultivating 100 Zhang Qiuxiangs, 100 Liu Shuxians, 100 Liu Hengjies, 100 Li Baochengs, and 100 Xu Tingzhans (youth labor model), and organized advanced producers to adopt the method of one person leading ten people and ten people leading hundreds of people to expand the ranks of advanced producers. The specific methods are:

    1. Focus on cultivating the second and third in command. For example, Liu Shuxian cultivated Liu Xijie, and Liu Xijie is cultivating his second in command. Zhang Qiuxiang brought up Xue Junxiu, and Xue Junxiu brought up Lu Yumei and Zhang Zhifang.

    2. Each year, rotate outstanding commune members from various production teams to participate in the farming of high-yield fields led by advanced producers, and systematically and completely impart experience throughout the entire cultivation process.

    3. With advanced producers as teachers, establish Red Flag Agricultural Schools including five sections: grain, cotton, aquaculture, animal husbandry, and machinery, and absorb more than 2,200 commune members from the entire management area to participate in learning.

    The mass movement of learning from the advanced combined with the activities of advanced figures taking apprentices, promoted the spirit of the masses daring to think and daring to do, and boldly creating, and promoted the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses striving to be upstream and catching up with the advanced, and improved the communist style of the masses of being selfless and helping each other. This laid a solid ideological and technical foundation for the socialist labor competition in Shuangwang Management Area.

		Vigorously Carry Out Hand-in-Hand Ring Races

    On the basis of "everyone learning from the advanced," Shuangwang Management Area vigorously carries out hand-in-hand ring races. Comparison competitions are carried out between teams, groups, and individuals. The twelve production teams in the entire management area each cultivate a high-yield square, and each high-yield square is divided into several farming groups. There are competitions between squares, between groups, and between individuals within groups.

    There are various forms of competition, with one common feature: catching up and helping each other, competing and cooperating. This style was created under the education of the Party organization and led by advanced producers. The Party organization often educates advanced producers with communist ideas of individual subordination to the collective and the part subordinating to the whole, constantly overcomes the tendency of technical conservatism and simply pursuing personal honor that are still in the budding stage, and clearly puts forward: "Helping others catch up with yourself is considered completing the task, and helping others surpass yourself is considered overfulfilling the task." "Leave the difficulties to yourself and give the convenience to others," and "It's not good for one person to learn well, it's good for everyone to learn well." This is Zhang Qiuxiang's famous saying, and it is also the common creed of all advanced producers in Shuangwang Management Area. In the labor competition since 1958, the Wu Yang Team was a relatively backward unit. In order to help the Wu Yang Team catch up with the advanced, Liu Shuxian moved his experimental field to Wu Yang Village to lead the Wu Yang Team in achieving high yields, and personally went to Xi'an to buy mules and horses and rubber-wheeled carts for the Wu Yang Team. The story of Zhang Qiuxiang and Xue Junxiu "land connected to the fields, hearts connected to each other" is even more widely circulated. When Xue Junxiu was catching up with Zhang Qiuxiang, Qiuxiang gave Junxiu suggestions for improving farming techniques at any time and taught her experience without reservation. When Junxiu's cotton field lacked chemical fertilizer, Qiuxiang divided half of her chemical fertilizer to Junxiu. In the autumn of 1958, Junxiu's cotton yield exceeded Qiuxiang's. Qiuxiang happily said: "It is a good thing for Junxiu to surpass me. This shows that the output of our cotton has not reached its limit and can continue to improve." Zhang Qiuxiang also often went to cotton fields throughout the team and even the entire management area to teach cotton pruning techniques.

    Under the influence of these advanced figures, the awareness and style of the broad masses of commune members are also constantly improving. They regard the honor of advanced producers as their own honor, and both catch up with the advanced and help the advanced. One evening last spring, the weather forecast predicted strong winds. The masses were afraid that the wheat in Liu Shuxian's experimental field would be blown down by the wind, so they sent six or seventy strings of bamboo mats overnight to help Liu Shuxian set up windbreaks. This year, in the cotton field preparation, Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton field lacked base fertilizer, and various production teams in the entire management area sent 40,000 to 50,000 *jin* of high-quality fertilizer within a few days. The broad masses of commune members also engage in both competition and collaboration with each other.

	The Most Important Thing is the Party's Leadership

    Shuangwang Management Area is not only a place where heroes gather and red flags are like forests, but also these red flags never fade. In previous political movements, they resolutely followed the Party and always maintained the glorious title of red commune members. The most fundamental reason why they can do this is that the local Party organization adheres to the principles of advanced producers not deviating from the Party's leadership, not deviating from the masses, and not deviating from production, and promotes advanced producers to develop a spirit of continuous revolution and a humble style.

    The Party organization's cultivation of advanced producers combines active support with strict requirements. The Party organization regards cultivating advanced figures and promoting advanced experience as a regular and important task. Once a new force emerges among the masses, the Party organization immediately supports it in all aspects: if they need to learn technology, they invite masters for them; if they need land and fertilizer, they give them priority in allocation; if they encounter difficulties, they cheer them up; if they are criticized, they support them; and if they achieve success and experience, they vigorously publicize and promote them. "Without the Party's cultivation, there would be no advanced figures," is the common experience of all advanced producers here. On the other hand, the Party organization's requirements for advanced producers are very strict. All advanced producers must participate in production labor and mass political activities like ordinary commune members; all Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among advanced producers must participate in the organizational life of the Party and the League like ordinary Party members and League members. Here, they also adhere to such a system: every six months, the masses are mobilized to conduct an appraisal of advanced producers. At the same time, they often solicit opinions from the masses on the technical aspects of advanced producers' farming through old farmers' forums and mass meetings. The Party organization promptly criticizes and corrects even the shortcomings that exist in the budding stage among advanced producers. In view of the fact that some advanced producers are prone to pride and complacency after achieving some success, the Party organization has adopted the practice of constantly putting forward new tasks, so that advanced producers realize that their achievements always lag behind the requirements of the objective situation and the requirements of the masses, thereby prompting them to always maintain soaring enthusiasm and a humble style.

    Because the Party organization has adopted the above-mentioned correct practices, the advanced producers here often maintain close contact with the masses; the masses respect and are kind to the advanced producers. On the one hand, they praise the advanced and learn from the advanced, and on the other hand, they do not regard the advanced figures as unreachable, but move forward hand in hand like brothers and sisters.

    At present, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a call to the people of the province to carry out the labor competition movement of 100,000 Red Flag Units and millions of Red Flag Hands, which is a great encouragement to the masses in Shuangwang Management Area. All advanced producers and the broad masses are full of confidence and high spirits, determined to further deepen the labor competition, strive to become Red Flag Units for each team and group, and strive to become Red Flag Hands for everyone, so that Shuangwang Management Area will have more heroes, redder red flags, and larger strides in the leap forward.

    共产主义劳动的光辉
    陕西省渭南县城关公社双王管理区先进人物的成长
    林牧　毛维
    “群英聚会双王乡，样样活路有双王：秋香俊秀棉花王，述贤希杰粮食王，恒杰居杰工具王，五百多名红旗手，八百里秦川美名扬。”
    这是双王管理区（原双王乡）群众歌颂劳动竞赛成果的一首动人的赞歌，也是这里热气腾腾的跃进局面的真实写照。
    双王管理区，是农业战线上开展劳动竞赛的一面红旗。它的显著特点是：竞赛成习，协作成风，英雄成群，经验成套，共产主义劳动大放光采。这里，有农民科学研究员植棉能手张秋香，以及她的出色的学生薛俊秀；有全国著名的工具改革能手刘恒杰，和他的亲密战友刘居杰；有连年创造小麦、玉米高产纪录的劳动模范刘述贤和刘希杰；还有养猪模范李保成和劳动竞赛中涌现出的五百六十多名先进生产者。这个数字占全管区人口的5％，占劳动力总数的12％。这里，有成套的植棉经验，并且创造了亩产籽棉三千一百零四斤的全省最高棉花丰产纪录；有成套的小麦、玉米丰产经验，并且创造了亩产玉米二千六百二十七斤的全省最高玉米丰产纪录，和亩产小麦一千八百零六斤的小麦高产纪录。这里，从1958年以来，创制、仿制和改良的工具共一百多种，推广十多万件，由耕作、水利、运输到炊事、饲养、加工，各方面都已经配套成龙。这里真是事事都先进，行行出状元。
              先进经验全面开花
    双王管理区的劳动竞赛，是适应着互助合作运动的步伐而逐步发展起来的，是随着大跃进和人民公社化的实现而进入高级阶段的，它是大规模集体生产的产物，是广大群众社会主义和共产主义精神不断高涨的产物；而党的正确领导和长期培养，则是促进劳动竞赛胜利发展的根本保证和决定因素。
    从1952年互助合作运动开展以后，原双王乡就是渭南县党组织重点培养的单位。1955年，这里出现了张秋香培育的亩产籽棉一千二百二十五斤的丰产纪录，1956年，又出现了刘述贤培育的亩产小麦一千一百零二斤的丰产纪录。这是刘述贤、张秋香向先进生产者史安福、曲耀离学习的第一曲凯歌。为了推广刘述贤、张秋香的丰产经验，把广大群众提高到先进生产者的水平，1956年初，双王乡党总支一面向群众提出了“人人学述贤，人人学秋香”的口号；一面向先进人物提出了带徒弟的任务，不断扩大先进生产者的队伍。
    学先进的群众运动，一开始就表现为一场新的思想的斗争。有人说高额丰产是胡吹牛；有人说述贤、秋香是“能人”，他们能办到，别人办不到。对先进经验赞成的、怀疑的、反对的三种人，都在扩大自己的阵地。谁在这个斗争中冲锋陷阵、打开学习先进的局面呢？党总支提出党员一人搞一亩丰产田、干部人人搞丰产的号召。当时的党总支书记杨文焕同志和乡长王昌黎同志还带头搞了一亩棉花试验田，向张秋香学习植棉经验。党员和干部走在前面，群众也就跟着来了。接着，党总支又组织先进人物到各队讲学，介绍自己的经验和创造高产纪录的斗争过程，把先进经验的种子撒遍全乡。到1957年，这里就有了七十五个“秋香组”，分布在各个生产队。到1958年年初，在万人粮棉誓师大会上，因学习先进取得成就而受到奖励的就有一百多人。
    人民公社成立以后，大规模集体生产和人民群众共产主义思想的大高涨，为学先进的运动创造了更为良好的条件。党组织又提出了培养一百名张秋香、一百名刘述贤、一百名刘恒杰、一百名李保成、一百名许廷占（青年劳动模范）的“五个一百”的规划，组织先进生产者采取一人带十人、十人带百人的方法，扩大先进生产者的队伍。具体做法是：
    一、重点培养二把手、三把手。比如刘述贤培养出了刘希杰，刘希杰又在培养自己的二把手。张秋香带起了薛俊秀，薛俊秀又带起了卢玉梅、张志芳。
    二、每年轮班吸收各个生产队的优秀社员，参加先进生产者领导的丰产田的作务，在整个耕作过程中，系统地、成套地传授经验。
    三、以先进生产者为教师，设立了包括粮、棉、水产、畜牧、机械五个部分的红旗农业学校，吸收全管理区二千二百多名社员参加学习。
    群众性的学先进的运动，同先进人物带徒弟的活动结合起来，发扬了群众敢想敢做、大胆创造的精神，促进了群众争上游、赶先进的革命干劲，提高了群众大公无私、互相帮助的共产主义风格。这就给双王管理区社会主义劳动竞赛从思想上和技术上奠定了牢固的基础。
              大搞携手连环赛
    双王管理区在“人人学先进”的基础上，大搞携手连环赛。队与队、组与组、个人与个人之间的对比竞赛。全管区十二个生产队各搞一块丰产方，各个丰产方又划分为若干作务组。方与方赛，组与组赛，组内个人与个人赛。
    竞赛形式多种多样，有一个共同的特点，就是又赶又帮，又竞赛又协作。这种作风，是在党组织的教育下，由先进生产者带头作起的。党组织经常用个人服从集体、小局服从大局的共产主义思想教育先进生产者，不断克服那些还在萌芽状态的技术保守和单纯追求个人荣誉的倾向，并且明确提出：“帮助别人赶上自己才算完成任务，帮助别人超过自己算是超额完成任务。”“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”、“一人学好不算好，大家学好才算好。”这是张秋香的名言，也是双王管理区所有先进生产者的共同的信条。在1958年以来的劳动竞赛中，吴杨小队是比较落后的单位。为了帮助吴杨小队赶上先进，刘述贤把自己的试验田搬到吴杨村，带动吴杨小队搞丰产，并且亲自到西安代吴杨小队买骡马、买胶轮车。张秋香同薛俊秀“地连畔，心连心”的故事，更是到处流传的佳话。当薛俊秀赶张秋香的时候，秋香随时给俊秀提出改进作务的意见，把自己的经验毫不保留地教给俊秀。当俊秀的棉田缺少化肥的时候，秋香把自己的化肥分给俊秀一半。1958年秋天，俊秀的棉花产量超过了秋香，秋香高兴地说：“俊秀超过我是一件好事，这说明咱们的棉花产量还没有到头，还可以继续提高。”张秋香还经常到全队以至全管理区的棉田传授棉花整枝的技术。
    在这些先进人物的影响下，广大社员的觉悟和风格也在不断地提高。他们把先进生产者的荣誉看作自己的荣誉，既赶先进，又帮先进。去年春天有一个晚上，气象预报要刮大风，群众怕刘述贤试验田的麦子受风倒伏，连夜送来六七十串竹箔，帮助刘述贤搭起防风障。今年，在棉田备耕中，张秋香的棉田缺少底肥，全管区各生产队在几天之内送来优质肥料四、五万斤。广大社员相互之间，也是既搞竞赛，又搞协作。
            最重要的是党的领导
    双王管理区不仅是英雄成群、红旗成林，而且这些红旗是永不褪色的。他们在历次政治运动中，坚决跟着党走，始终保持着红社员的光荣称号。所以能够作到这一点，最根本的原因是由于当地党组织坚持了先进生产者不脱离党的领导、不脱离群众和不脱离生产的原则，促使先进生产者养成了不断革命的精神和谦逊的作风。
    党组织对于先进生产者的培养，是把积极支持和严格要求结合在一起的。党组织把培养先进人物、推广先进经验，当作经常的重要任务，群众中的新生力量一经出现，党组织就立即从各方面加以扶植：需要学技术，就为他们请师傅；需要土地、肥料，就为他们优先调拨；碰到了困难，就为他们打气；受到了非难，就为他们撑腰；取得了成绩和经验，就大张旗鼓地加以宣传和推广。“没有党的培养就不会有先进人物”，这是这里所有先进生产者的共同的体会。在另一方面，党组织对于先进生产者的要求又是很严格的，所有的先进生产者，都要像普通社员一样地参加生产劳动和群众性的政治活动；先进生产者当中所有的共产党员和共青团员，都要像普通党员、团员一样地过党、团的组织生活。这里还坚持实行着这样一种制度；每隔半年要发动群众对先进生产者作一次鉴定。同时，经常通过老农座谈会和群众会，征求群众对先进生产者在作务技术方面的意见。党组织对于先进生产者当中存在的哪怕是处于萌芽状态的缺点，也要及时进行批评和纠正。鉴于部分先进生产者在取得一些成绩以后，容易产生骄傲和满足现状的情绪，党组织采取了不断提出新任务的作法，让先进生产者认识到，自己的成就总是赶不上客观形势的要求和群众的要求的，从而促使他们始终保持着冲天的干劲和谦逊的作风。
    由于党组织采取了以上这些正确的作法，这里的先进生产者，都经常保持和群众的密切联系；群众对于先进生产者，是既尊重又亲切。一方面歌颂先进、学习先进，一方面又不把先进人物看作高不可攀的人，而是像兄弟姐妹一样地携手前进。
    目前，中共陕西省委向全省人民发出了开展十万红旗单位、百万红旗手的劳动竞赛运动的号召，这对双王管理区的群众是一个极大的鼓舞。所有先进生产者和广大群众，都是信心百倍、意气风发，决心进一步深入地开展劳动竞赛，队队、组组争取成为红旗单位，人人争取成为红旗手，要使双王管理区的英雄更多，红旗更红，跃进的步伐跨得更大。
