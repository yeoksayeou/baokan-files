Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support the report on the draft 1960 National Economic Plan made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun on behalf of the State Council, and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Tan Zhenlin. These important documents will further mobilize the people of the whole country to strive for a comprehensive, better, and continued leap forward this year!

Since 1958, China's socialist construction has entered a new stage, opening up a leap forward in national economic development that is both high-speed and proportionate. In 1959, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, we achieved a continued great leap forward in the national economy. The reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the other Vice Premiers comprehensively summarized the great achievements and rich experiences of national construction last year. In agriculture, we overcame serious natural disasters, and the output of grain, cotton, and other crops increased significantly. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have all been comprehensively developed. In industry, the output of steel and coal both exceeded the original plans, the variety of products increased significantly, the quality improved significantly, and costs were reduced a lot. I remember that not long ago, when we verified the output of agricultural products in 1958 and adjusted the national economic plan targets for 1959, the imperialists headed by the United States were indeed happy for a while. They viciously slandered us, and absurdly claimed that the great leap forward in 1958 was a "great leap backward," and that 1959 was China's "darkest year," and so on. However, the imperialists laughed too early. Before long, the Chinese people used their heroic labor to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, strengthened the material foundation of China's socialist construction, and shortened the timetable for catching up with and surpassing Britain. Let those imperialists and all reactionaries continue to howl aside! Our socialist ship will always follow the established course, and speed forward toward the grand goal.

The reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the other Vice Premiers also presented a magnificent picture of continued leap forward before us. According to this year's national economic plan, China's total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by 23% on the basis of last year's great leap forward; steel output will increase by 38%, coal output will increase by 22%, and grain and cotton output will each increase by about 10%. Such a huge growth rate, like in 1958 and 1959, is still beyond the reach of any capitalist country. Taking steel production as an example, it took Britain seventeen years to increase from more than 13 million tons to about 18 million tons, the United States took four years, and France and Japan had not reached this level until last year. The road that these capitalist countries took several or even more than ten years to complete will be completed by the Chinese people in one year. Taking grain as an example, capitalist countries not only grow slowly, but are also very unstable. China has implemented the policy of "taking grain as the key link," and not only has grain production maintained a continuous leap forward speed for several consecutive years, but also other economic crops have been comprehensively and rationally arranged. This year's draft national economic plan points out that the sown area of ​​economic crops should be guaranteed, and that more chemical fertilizers and pesticides should be allocated to economic crops. China's Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan and other places are particularly suitable for growing tropical and subtropical economic crops such as rubber. Many returned overseas Chinese have already made outstanding achievements in this area, and recently many overseas Chinese have returned to the motherland to participate in socialist construction, which will further increase the strength in this area. I believe that China's agriculture, whether it is grain and economic crops, whether it is planting or animal husbandry, will have greater and more comprehensive development. All this fully shows that this year's national economic plan is a plan for continued leap forward. It concentratesly reflects the Chinese people's great ambition to quickly get rid of the poor and blank state, and embodies the incomparable superiority of the socialist system.

Fellow representatives! Today's situation and conditions are very favorable for us to achieve a continued leap forward this year. From an international perspective, the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. We are getting better day by day, and the enemy is rotting day by day. Latin America, which has always been regarded as the "backyard" of the United States, has become the front line against American imperialism. The flames of national liberation struggles have generally ignited in Africa and Asia. Our China was also subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time before liberation. Therefore, we have empathy for the plight of colonial and semi-colonial people, and we harbor righteous indignation against the imperialists who invaded and oppressed them. We fully support their just struggle. The socialist countries, the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the peace-loving people of the world unite and wage unremitting struggles, which will inevitably force the aggressive forces and war forces to continue to retreat step by step. Soon, Premier Zhou Enlai will go to India to meet with Prime Minister Nehru. This once again shows China's sincerity in actively maintaining the traditional friendship between China and India and peacefully resolving the Sino-Indian border issue, which is in the interests of the people of China and India and the aspirations of the peace-loving people of the world. Our democratic parties and the people of the whole country resolutely support the policies and measures adopted by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue.

In our country, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation has swept the country and become a magnificent mass movement. The good news of completing the first quarter's production ahead of schedule is constantly coming. The spring plowing work of the rural people's communes is proceeding early, quickly, and well. When we gather here, we look around inside and outside the Great Wall, north and south of the Yangtze River. On the 9.6 million square kilometers of land, there is a scene of prosperity and vitality everywhere. Some representatives vividly described the image of our country today with four "ten thousands": "the people are of one heart and mind, ten thousand horses gallop, ten thousand purples and thousands of reds, and ten thousand phenomena are renewed." With such a good foundation and conditions, through the joint efforts of 650 million people across the country, I firmly believe that our national economic plan this year will not only be completed as scheduled, but also exceeded.

The achievements we have made are extremely great. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the three magic weapons that the Party and Chairman Mao found for us during the socialist construction period. They are the products of Mao Zedong Thought. They fully organize the strength of the people of the whole country and comprehensively mobilize the enthusiasm of all aspects, so that China's socialist construction cause leaps forward and leaps forward again at an unprecedented speed in history. In the future, as long as we conscientiously study and master Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will be able to move from victory to new and greater victories.

Like the other democratic parties, our Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, after the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement in 1957, and through the national Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, has taken a big step forward on the long journey from a bourgeois political party to a political force that truly serves socialism. The political and ideological outlook of most members has also undergone great changes in the process of actively serving socialism. Generally speaking, there has been great progress. However, the progress we have made in self-transformation and the achievements we have made in participating in socialist construction are still a considerable distance away from the requirements of the leap-forward development of the motherland and compared with the soaring revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of working people. Therefore, we must continue to transform our political stance and thinking without pride or impetuosity. Recently, the Party Central Committee called on industrialists and businessmen across the country to determine to "take care of one end" and "lean to one side." This teaching is equally important for our RCCK members. We must mobilize all members and lead the masses we are connected with to earnestly follow the Party's teachings, correctly handle the relationship between individual interests and the interests of the country and the people, wholeheartedly take care of the interests of the country and the people, lean towards the side of socialism, and work with the people of the whole country to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national economic plan!

At present, China's socialist cause is developing and deepening day by day. Cities across the country are vigorously running people's communes, vigorously running street industries, vigorously running service undertakings, vigorously running public canteens, nurseries, and neighborhood service stations, and extensively organizing the economic life of residents. All this is not only conducive to the development of production and construction, but also to the thorough transformation of urban social life. The emergence of urban people's communes has put forward more urgent requirements and provided more favorable conditions for the self-transformation of members of the democratic parties. Our RCCK and other democratic parties must correctly understand the great significance of urban people's communes, enthusiastically support this historically significant initiative, actively participate in various tasks of organizing urban people's economic life, speed up the pace, catch up quickly, and keep up with the great era.

Fellow representatives! I have walked through five-quarters of a century of life, and experienced the historical periods of the old democratic revolution, the new democratic revolution, and the socialist revolution. I have personally witnessed the reactionary dynasties of the Qing Dynasty emperor, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek Group fall one by one. I have personally witnessed the imperialist forces being driven out of the Chinese mainland, and personally witnessed a prosperous and strong new China standing up in East Asia. Those ideals that Mr. Sun Yat-sen and many revolutionary martyrs fought for and dreamed of all their lives have not only been thoroughly realized today under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, but have also been greatly surpassed. The excitement in my heart cannot be expressed in words. As I conclude this speech, I can only shout loudly:

Long live our great motherland!

Long live the glorious, great, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

专栏：

    我们一定要赶上伟大的时代
    何香凝副委员长在人大二次会议上的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和热烈拥护李富春副总理代表国务院所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念、谭震林两位副总理的报告；这几个重要文件，必将进一步动员全国人民，为实现今年全面的更好的继续跃进而奋斗！
    从1958年开始，我国的社会主义建设已经跨进了一个新阶段，开辟了国民经济发展的既高速度、又按比划的跃进局面；1959年，我们在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了国民经济的继续大跃进。李富春副总理和其他几位副总理的报告，全面地总结了去年国家建设的伟大成绩和丰富经验。在农业方面，我们战胜了严重的自然灾害，粮食、棉花和其他农作物的产量都有了很大的增加，农、林、牧、副、渔各业都得到了全面的发展。在工业方面，钢和煤的产量，都超额完成了原订计划，各种产品的品种有了很大的增加，质量有了显著的提高，成本也降低了很多。记得不久之前，当我们核实1958年农产品产量和调整1959年国民经济计划指标的时候，以美国为首的帝国主义者确曾高兴过一阵，他们恶毒地诬蔑我们，胡说什么1958年的大跃进是“大跃退”，1959年是我国“最暗淡的年份”等等。但是，帝国主义者未免笑得过早了，曾几何时，我国人民就以自己的英勇劳动，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，增强了我国社会主义建设的物质基础，缩短了赶上和超过英国的时间表。让那些帝国主义者和一切反动派在一旁不断嚎叫吧！我们的社会主义航船，总是要沿着既定的航线，向着宏伟的目标，开足马力向前飞驰的。
    李富春副总理和其他几位副总理的报告，又把一幅宏伟壮丽的继续跃进的巨画，展现在我们的面前。根据今年国民经济计划，我国的工农业总产值将在去年大跃进的基数上增长23％；钢的产量增长38％，煤的产量增长22％，粮食、棉花的产量各增长10％左右。这样巨大的增长速度，同1958年和1959年一样，仍然是任何一个资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。拿钢的产量来说，从一千三百多万吨增加到一千八百万吨左右，英国用了十七年的时间，美国用了四年的时间，法国和日本直到去年还没有达到这个水平。这些资本主义国家用了几年甚至十几年时间才能走完的路程，我国人民要在一年的时间里走完。拿粮食来说，资本主义国家不仅增长缓慢，而且很不稳定。我国贯彻执行了“以粮为纲”的方针，不仅粮食生产连续几年保持不断跃进的速度，就是其他各种经济作物也得到了全面的合理安排。今年国民经济计划草案指出：应当保证完成经济作物的播种面积，保证为经济作物调配较多的化肥和农药。我国的广东、福建、广西、云南等地，特别适于种植热带、亚热带经济作物如橡胶等。许多回国侨胞已经在这方面作出了卓越的成绩，最近又有许多侨胞回到祖国参加社会主义建设，将进一步增加这方面的力量。我相信我国的农业，无论是粮食和经济作物，无论是种植或者畜牧，都将有更大、更全面的发展。这一切，都充分表明今年的国民经济计划是一个继续跃进的计划，它集中地反映了我国人民迅速摆脱一穷二白面貌的雄心壮志，体现了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    各位代表！今天的形势和条件，对于我们实现今年的继续跃进，是非常有利的。从国际上看，东风继续压倒西风，我们一天天好起来，敌人一天天烂下去。一向被美国当作“后院”的拉丁美洲，已经变成反对美帝国主义的前线；非洲、亚洲普遍燃起了民族解放斗争的烽火。我们中国在解放前也长期受过帝国主义的侵略和压迫，因此对于殖民地、半殖民地人民的处境，寄予感同身受的同情；对于侵略压迫他们的帝国主义者，怀着敌忾同仇的义愤。我们全力支持他们的正义斗争。社会主义各国、殖民地半殖民地人民和全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致，进行不懈的斗争，必将迫使侵略势力和战争势力继续步步退却。不久，周恩来总理将去印度与尼赫鲁总理会谈。这再一次表明我国积极维护中印传统友谊与和平解决中印边界问题的诚意，是符合中印两国人民的利益和全世界爱好和平的人民的愿望的。我们各民主党派和全国人民，坚决拥护我国政府对中印边界问题所采取的方针政策。
    在我们国内，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动已经席卷全国，成为一个波澜壮阔的全民运动；提前完成第一季度的生产捷报不断传来；农村人民公社的春播工作正在又早又快又好地进行。当我们在这里集会的时候，我们环顾长城内外，大江南北，在九百六十万平方公里的国土上，到处是一片欣欣向荣、生气勃勃的春色。有的代表用“万众一心，万马奔腾，万紫千红，万象更新”这四个“万”字，生动地描绘了我们国家今天的形象。有了这样良好的基础和条件，通过全国六亿五千万人的共同努力，我深信，我们今年的国民经济计划，不仅有把握如期完成，而且一定将超额完成。
    我们已经取得的成就是极其伟大的。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是在社会主义建设时期，党和毛主席给我们找到的三个法宝，是毛泽东思想的产物，它把全国人民的力量都充分组织起来，把各个方面的积极性都全面调动起来，从而使我国的社会主义建设事业，以历史上所未有过的高速度，跃进再跃进。今后，只要我们认真地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，我们就能从胜利走向新的、更大的胜利。
    我们民革同各民主党派一样，在中国共产党的领导下，在1957年的反右派斗争和整风运动之后，经过1958年、1959年的全民大跃进，在从资产阶级性政党转变为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量的长途中，又向前跨进了一大步；大多数成员在积极为社会主义服务的过程中，政治思想面貌也发生了很大的变化。总的说来是大有进步。但是，我们在自我改造方面所取得的一些进步，在参加社会主义建设工作中所做出的一些成绩，以祖国飞跃发展形势的要求来衡量，同广大劳动人民的冲天革命干劲相比较，还有一段不小的距离，因此必须不骄不馁地继续进行政治立场和思想的改造。最近，党中央号召全国工商业者下决心“顾一头”“一边倒”，这个教导对于我们民革成员也是同样重要的。我们一定要动员全体成员，并带动所联系的群众，切实遵循党的教导，正确地处理好个人利益同国家利益、人民利益的关系，一心一意顾国家利益、人民利益这一头，倒向社会主义这一边，和全国人民一道，为完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划而奋斗！
    当前，我国的社会主义事业，正在日益发展，步步深入。全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办服务事业，大办公共食堂、托儿所、邻里服务站，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，这一切，不仅有利于生产建设的开展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造。城市人民公社的出现，对各民主党派成员的自我改造，提出了更迫切的要求，提供了更有利的条件。我们民革和各民主党派一起，一定要正确认识城市人民公社的重大意义，热烈支持这一具有历史意义的创举，积极参加组织城市人民经济生活的各种工作，快马加鞭，急起直追，跟上伟大的时代。
    各位代表！我走过五分之四世纪的生活道路，经历了旧民主主义革命、新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的历史时期，我亲眼看到从清朝皇帝、北洋军阀到蒋介石集团的反动王朝一个个倒了下去，亲眼看到帝国主义势力被驱逐出中国大陆，亲眼看到一个繁荣昌盛的新中国在东亚站立起来。孙中山先生和许多革命先烈为之毕生奋斗、梦寐以求的那些理想，今天在共产党和毛主席领导下，不仅彻底实现了，而且大大地超过了。我内心的激动不是言语所能表达于万一。当我结束这篇发言的时候，我只有高声欢呼：
    我们的伟大祖国万岁！
    光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
