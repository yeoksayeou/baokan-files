Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health jointly issued a "Notice on Launching a Large-Scale Patriotic Health Campaign and Strengthening Sports Activities in Schools at All Levels."

The notice said: "Currently, a vigorous new upsurge of patriotic health campaigns and sports movements is being launched nationwide. Schools at all levels, under the leadership of the local Party committees, should cooperate with various tasks such as learning, work, and production, and immediately mobilize to actively participate in the movement. Join the people of the whole country in vigorously eliminating the four pests, conscientiously cultivating hygienic habits, vigorously eliminating common diseases among students, and strengthening physical exercise. This is a great thing that is beneficial to production, learning, work, and enhancing the people's physical fitness. We must make full use of the current favorable opportunity to greatly improve the school's patriotic health campaign and mass sports movement. We must make significant achievements in two or three years, fundamentally change the hygienic appearance of schools, and enhance the physical fitness of the majority of teachers and students.

To this end, the notice put forward the following opinions:

1. The education and health administrative departments of each province, city, and autonomous region should, under the unified leadership of the Party and in conjunction with the current national patriotic health campaign and sports movement, seriously discuss the health and sports work of schools at all levels, formulate plans, establish and improve school health guidance committees, and give full play to their role.

In schools, the principal should take charge of health and sports work, personally take action, lead all teachers and students to eliminate the four pests, carry out hygiene, develop good hygienic habits, and establish an atmosphere of "hygiene is glorious, unhygienic is shameful." At the same time, mass sports activities should be strengthened, and the spirit of adapting to people, time, and local conditions should be implemented. Different sports exercises should be carried out according to the different conditions of the school and the different ages, genders, and health conditions of the students. Enable all teachers and students to actively participate in gymnastics, ball games, running, mountain climbing, swimming, skating, Tai Chi, and various sports activities, and persist regularly to effectively enhance their physical fitness.

2. Education and health administrative departments should cooperate closely and vigorously. Under the leadership of the health administrative department, local medical institutions, health and epidemic prevention institutions, related specialized prevention and treatment institutions, medical scientific research units, etc., should promote the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, guide and help schools to jointly carry out school health work. The health department should vigorously assist in training school medical staff and health teachers, and also improve the level of health knowledge of school head teachers and teachers by organizing health lectures.

3. Schools at all levels must vigorously mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of students, and regularly carry out propaganda work to make the great significance of eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, eliminating major diseases, and actively exercising known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Schools must earnestly educate students to realize that doing a good job in school and social hygiene is a glorious task, actively participate in the patriotic health campaigns of mines, factories, people's communes, and streets, and promote the mass patriotic health campaign and sports movement to a new stage.

    教育部卫生部联合通知各级学校
    大搞卫生体育运动
    根本改变学校卫生面貌，增强师生体质
    新华社7日讯　教育部和卫生部联合发出“关于在各级学校中大搞爱国卫生运动和加强体育运动的通知”。
    通知说：“目前，在全国范围内，正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的爱国卫生运动和体育运动的新高潮。各级学校，要在当地党委领导下，配合学习、工作、生产等各项任务，立即动员起来，积极投入到运动中去，和全国人民一道，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大除四害，认真培养卫生习惯，大力消灭学生中的常见疾病和加强体育锻炼。这是有利于生产、有利于学习、有利于工作、有利于增强人民体质的大好事，必须充分利用当前的大好时机，把学校的爱国卫生运动和群众性的体育运动大大提高一步。一定要在两三年内做出显著的成绩，根本改变学校的卫生面貌，增强广大师生的体质。
    为此，通知提出了以下几点意见：
    一、各省、市、自治区教育、卫生行政部门应在党的统一领导下，结合当前全国人民的爱国卫生运动和体育运动，把各级学校的卫生体育工作认真讨论一次，定出规划，并把学校保健指导委员会建立和健全起来，切实发挥它的作用。
    在学校中，校长应把卫生和体育工作抓起来，亲自动手，率领全体师生，大除四害，大搞卫生，养成良好的卫生习惯，树立“以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”的风气。同时还要加强群众性的体育活动，贯彻因人、因时、因地制宜的精神，根据学校的不同条件和学生的不同年龄、性别与健康情况，进行不同的体育锻炼。使全校师生积极参加做体操、打球、跑步、爬山、游泳、滑冰、打太极拳及各种各样的体育活动，并做到经常持久，以便有效地增强他们的体质。
    二、教育和卫生行政部门要密切配合，大力协作。在卫生行政部门领导下，各地医疗机构、卫生防疫机构、有关专业防治机构、医学科学研究单位等要发扬共产主义大协作精神，指导和帮助学校共同搞好学校卫生工作。卫生部门要大力协助培养学校医务人员和保健教师，还可通过组织卫生讲座的方式，提高学校班主任和教师的卫生知识水平。
    三、各级学校要大张旗鼓，充分发动学生的积极性主动性，经常开展宣传工作，把除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病和积极锻炼身体的重大意义，做到家喻户晓，深入人心。学校必须认真教育学生，认识到搞好学校卫生和社会卫生是一项光荣的任务，积极参加矿山、工厂、人民公社、街道的爱国卫生运动，把群众性的爱国卫生运动和体育运动推向一个新的阶段。
