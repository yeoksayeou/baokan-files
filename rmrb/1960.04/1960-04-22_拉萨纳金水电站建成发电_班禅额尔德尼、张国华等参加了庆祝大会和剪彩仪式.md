Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 20th - The largest hydroelectric power station on the Tibetan Plateau, the Lhasa Nagchin Hydropower Station, officially began generating electricity on the 19th.

On this day, more than 4,000 people from all walks of life in Lhasa held a celebration and ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Nagchin Hydropower Station. The power station was decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers, and red flags fluttered in the wind. Many Tibetan farmers from nearby villages also came to congratulate the event in festive costumes, carrying a huge banner that said "Build a New Tibet" while beating gongs and drums.

Panchen Erdini, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commander of the Tibet Military Region; Sangpo Tenzin Dhondup, Deputy Commander; Tan Guansan, Political Commissar; Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China; and Sangding Dorje Phagmo, Vice Chairman of the Tibet Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all attended the celebration and ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Panchen Erdini, Tan Guansan, and Fu Tingxiu, Commander of the Nagchin Hydropower Station Construction Headquarters, spoke at the meeting. Panchen Erdini said: The successful completion of the Nagchin Hydropower Station not only meets the lighting needs of Lhasa, but also creates extremely favorable conditions for Lhasa's industrial construction in the near future. He said that the completion of the Nagchin Hydropower Station is another glorious victory for the Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies in Tibet, and also a glorious victory for the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward in Tibet.

After the celebration, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held. When Panchen Erdini cut the ribbon with a smile, cheers, applause, and the sound of salutes resounded throughout the Lhasa River Valley.

After the ribbon-cutting, Panchen Erdini came to the newly built factory building and turned on the button on the console. At this time, a strong current immediately passed through the dense high-voltage lines and was sent to urban and suburban areas of Lhasa. The guests also visited the power station's water turbine generator and the inlet project. The inlet of the Nagchin Hydropower Station was built by splitting Mount Gabar in the middle. Precipitous rocks stand on both sides, and looking out from the inlet, the green Lhasa River water rippled in the reservoir, and newly planted willow trees swayed gently in the spring breeze.

The Nagchin Hydropower Station is one of the key power construction projects during the Second Five-Year Plan, with an installed capacity of 7,500 kilowatts. It took only eighteen months from the start of construction in October 1958 to its completion. Thousands of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and Tibetan and Han workers participated in the construction of the power station. They broke with convention, surveying, designing, and constructing simultaneously, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project. Splitting Mount Gabar was the most arduous key project in the construction of the Nagchin Hydropower Station. The mechanical units of the People's Liberation Army fought day and night, and the excavation task of hundreds of thousands of cubic meters was finally completed on schedule.

The Nagchin Hydropower Station received strong support from the people of the whole country during its construction. Almost all of the nearly 100 engineering and technical personnel who built the power station were supported by relevant departments of the Central Government and various provinces; more than 150 factories in 16 provinces and cities across the country also promptly transported the mechanical and electrical equipment and construction materials needed to build the power station to the Tibetan Plateau.

More than 5,000 Tibetan migrant workers from all over Tibet actively participated in the construction of the power station. The power station's spillway, dam, and river embankment were mainly built by them. Due to their outstanding work, more than 1,500 people were named advanced workers during the construction process. When many Tibetan migrant workers first arrived at the power station, they had never even heard of some simple terms, but with the patient help of Han technicians, they gradually mastered various technologies. Now more than 700 people have become skilled workers in mechanical and electrical engineering, rebar, concrete, and stonework. (Photo attached)

    拉萨纳金水电站建成发电
    班禅额尔德尼、张国华等参加了庆祝大会和剪彩仪式
    新华社拉萨20日电　西藏高原上目前最大的一座水力发电站——拉萨纳金水电站19日正式建成发电。
    这一天，拉萨市各界四千多人在纳金水电站举行了庆祝大会和剪彩仪式。电站上张灯结彩，红旗飘扬。电站附近村庄的许多藏族农民也穿着节日的盛装，抬着“建设新西藏”的巨幅标语，敲锣打鼓地前来祝贺。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼、中共西藏工委副书记、西藏军区司令员张国华、副司令员桑颇·才旺仁增、政治委员谭冠三、中共西藏工委副书记周仁山、政协西藏委员会副主席桑顶·多吉帕姆女活佛等，都参加了庆祝大会和剪彩仪式。
    班禅额尔德尼、谭冠三和纳金水电站修建指挥部指挥长扶挺修在大会上讲了话。班禅额尔德尼说：纳金水电站的胜利建成不仅满足了拉萨市的照明需要，而且为拉萨市近期的工业建设创造了极为有利的条件。他说，纳金水电站的建成是党和毛主席的民族政策在西藏的又一次光辉胜利，也是党的总路线和大跃进在西藏的光辉胜利。
    庆祝大会结束后，举行了剪彩仪式。当班禅额尔德尼满面笑容剪断彩绸时，欢呼声、掌声和礼炮声响彻了拉萨河谷。
    剪彩以后，班禅额尔德尼来到了新建的厂房里，扭开了控制台上的电钮。这时，强大的电流立即通过密集的高压线，送往拉萨市区和郊区。来宾们还参观了电站的水轮发电机和进水口工程。纳金水电站的进水口是将嘎巴山从中劈开建成的。两旁峭岩耸立，从进水口望出去，蓄水库里荡漾着碧绿的拉萨河水，堤岸上新栽的柳树在春风中轻轻摇曳。
    纳金水电站是国家第二个五年计划期间电力建设重点工程之一，装机容量七千五百瓩，从1958年10月动工到建成只花了十八个月的时间。几千名人民解放军官兵和藏、汉族工人参加了电站的建设工作。他们打破常规，边勘测、边设计、边施工，大大加快了工程进度。辟开嘎巴山是修建纳金水电站最艰巨的重点工程，人民解放军的机械部队日夜奋战，数十万立方米的开挖任务终于按期完成。
    纳金水电站在建设过程中得到了全国人民的大力支援。建设电站的近百名工程技术人员几乎全部是中央有关部门和各省支援的；全国十六个省、市的一百五十多个工厂，也把建设电站所需的机电设备和建筑器材及时运到了西藏高原。
    来自西藏各地的五千多名藏族民工积极参加了电站的建设工程。电站的溢洪堰、拦河坝和顺河坝等工程，主要是靠他们修筑起来的。由于他们出色的劳动，在施工过程中，有一千五百多人被评为先进工作者。许多藏族民工初到电站时，连一些简单的名词也没听说过，但他们在汉族技术工人的耐心帮助下，逐渐掌握了各种技术。现在已经有七百多人成为机电、钢筋、混凝土、石工等方面的技术工人。（附图片）
