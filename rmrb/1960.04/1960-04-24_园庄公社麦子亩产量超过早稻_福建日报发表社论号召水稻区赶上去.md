Fuzhou, April 23rd (by our own reporter) - The Yuanzhuang Commune in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, which has historically had low wheat yields, has achieved a bumper harvest in the "Wheat Surpassing Early Rice" campaign, overcoming natural disasters. This year, the commune's more than 5,600 mu of barley achieved an average yield of 514 jin per mu, an increase of more than 1.2 times compared to last year, and 3 jin higher than the average yield of early rice last year. More than 3,800 mu of wheat achieved an average yield of 415 jin per mu, an increase of more than 1 times compared to last year, approaching the average yield level of early rice last year. The commune planted more than 9,500 mu of barley and wheat, with a total output of more than 4,509,000 jin, an increase of approximately 3 times compared to last year, exceeding the total output of early rice last year by 15%, becoming the first high-yield "Red Flag Commune" in Fujian Province where wheat exceeds early rice. During the wheat harvest season, from the plains to the mountainous areas of Yuanzhuang Commune, the golden wheat grew as well as rice, with thick stalks and long ears, and the wheat waves rolled. During the days of the bumper harvest, the commune members were all smiles, working day and night to harvest the crops, and scenes of wheat-filled fields and granaries full of grain appeared everywhere. The Fujian Daily also published an editorial entitled "And See How Rice Will Do." The editorial stated that the fact that Yuanzhuang Commune has achieved a spring wheat yield exceeding early rice not only completely shattered the "spring wheat low-yield theory" and declared that spring wheat can jump into the ranks of high-yield crops, but also poses a new challenge to rice production throughout the province. It is necessary to take advantage of this spring wheat bumper harvest, boost the enthusiasm for increasing rice production, promote the spirit of perseverance of Yuanzhuang Commune to all regions of the province, launch a revolutionary competition of early rice surpassing spring wheat in the current early rice production, raise early rice production to a higher level, and achieve thousand-jin yields on a larger area.

    园庄公社麦子亩产量超过早稻
    福建日报发表社论号召水稻区赶上去
    本报福州23日电　福建仙游县历年麦子低产的园庄公社，在“麦子超早稻”的丰产运动中，战胜自然灾害，获得大丰收。今年全社五千六百多亩大麦，平均亩产五百一十四斤，比去年增产一点二倍多，比去年早稻平均亩产量高出三斤；三千八百多亩小麦平均亩产达到四百一十五斤，比去年增产一倍以上，接近去年早稻的平均产量水平。全社种植大小麦九千五百多亩，总产量四百五十万九千多斤，比去年约增三倍多，超过去年早稻总产量15％，成为福建省第一个麦子超过早稻的丰产“红旗社”。麦收季节园庄公社平原到山区，黄金般的麦子长得和水稻一样出色，秆粗穗长，麦浪滚滚。大丰收的日子里，社员们个个眉开眼笑，夜以继日地抢收，四处出现麦满场、粮满仓的丰收景象。福建日报也以“且看水稻如何”为题发表了社论。社论说，园庄公社实现了春麦超早稻的事实，不仅彻底打破了“春麦低产论”，宣告了春麦可以跃居高产行列，而对全省的水稻生产来说也是一个新的挑战。必须乘此春麦大丰收之风，大鼓水稻增产干劲，把园庄公社那种坚持不懈的革命干劲，推广到全省各个地区，在当前的早稻生产上，开展早稻超春麦的革命竞赛，把早稻生产提到更高的水平，在更大的面积上实现千斤丰产。
