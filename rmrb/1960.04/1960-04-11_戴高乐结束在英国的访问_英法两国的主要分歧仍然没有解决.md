Xinhua News Agency, London, April 9th: French President De Gaulle concluded his four-day state visit to Britain yesterday.

In an effort to win over France, the British government arranged especially lavish ceremonies and activities to welcome De Gaulle, the scale of which was the largest for any foreign dignitary since the war, surpassing even the welcome given to US President Eisenhower last year.

The long-standing atmosphere of tension between the two countries seemed to have changed somewhat, but differences on substantive issues remain unresolved after the visit.

British Prime Minister Macmillan held two informal political talks with De Gaulle. According to information revealed by Western newspapers and news agencies, the two sides discussed the issue of France's demand to become an "atomic power," the issue of the Six and Seven nations, and the issue of an East-West summit conference.

Regarding the relationship between the Six and Seven nations, it was revealed that De Gaulle "listened very attentively" to Macmillan's complaints about the Hallstein Plan. However, even Reuters acknowledged that De Gaulle's visit "did not produce concrete solutions."

The main purpose of the Anglo-French negotiations on a summit meeting was merely to try to narrow the distance between the two governments' strategies towards the Soviet Union. Some signs indicate that De Gaulle's attitude is still very close to Adenauer's, while Britain is retreating from its original position, not only due to the attitude of the United States, but also in order to bargain with Paris and Bonn, seeking to make them make certain economic concessions.

### 戴高乐结束在英国的访问  英法两国的主要分歧仍然没有解决

    戴高乐结束在英国的访问
    英法两国的主要分歧仍然没有解决
    据新华社伦敦9日电　法国总统戴高乐昨天结束了在英国的四天国事访问。
    为了拉拢法国，英国政府特别铺张地安排了这次欢迎戴高乐的各种仪式和活动，其规模是战后对外国贵宾最大的，超过了去年对美国总统艾森豪威尔的欢迎。
    两国之间长期来关系紧张的气氛似乎有了些改变，但是在实质性问题上的分歧在访问后仍然看不到有所解决。
    英国首相麦克米伦同戴高乐举行了两次非正式的政治性会谈。从西方报纸和通讯社透露的一些情况来看，双方谈到了关于法国要求成为“原子大国”的问题、六国和七国关系的问题和关于东西方首脑会议的问题。
    关于六国和七国之间的关系，据透露，戴高乐“非常注意地听取了”麦克米伦对哈尔斯坦计划的怨言。但是甚至路透社也承认，戴高乐的访问“并没有产生具体的解决办法”。
    英法关于最高级会议谈判的主要的目的只是设法缩短两国政府对待苏联的策略上的距离。一些迹象表明，现在戴高乐的态度仍然同阿登纳的态度很接近，而英国却正在从原来的态度后退，这不仅是由于美国的态度，也是为了可以同巴黎和波恩讨价还价，设法使它们作出某些经济方面的让步。
