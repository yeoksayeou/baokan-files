Comrades,

I completely agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the 1960 national budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. These reports summarized the victory of our country's continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 and put forward a grand plan for a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1960, which made me feel infinitely excited and encouraged. Under the brilliant light of the General Line and under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the 600 million people of our country will surely follow the correct path led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and continue to leap forward.

I am an educator and have worked in universities for many years. Please allow me to talk about my personal experiences on the issue of educational revolution.

Over the past two years, China's higher education has developed greatly. In the practice of implementing the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, the quality of education has been greatly improved, and the ideological outlook of the vast number of teachers and students has also undergone significant changes. Take Shandong University, where I work, as an example. Since the relocation to Jinan at the end of 1958, under the correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the University Party Committee, the number of departments and majors has doubled in just over a year, and the number of students has also greatly increased. In the case of insufficient teachers and equipment, some departments (such as the Physics Department) started from scratch. Teachers and students worked together to open several majors and specializations in a short period of time and quickly developed into several departments to meet the needs of the country in training cadres. The university has established several factories to directly serve the industrial and agricultural construction of the province and become a production labor base for students. The number of scientific research projects in the entire university is in the thousands, most of which are projects combined with the province's or the country's production and construction. For example, the linear programming research of the Mathematics Department has solved many problems for the province's material allocation and transportation work, saving the country tens of millions of yuan (detailed reports have been published in the People's Daily); the research on quality control has also solved several problems for the province's textile industry. The mass production of barium ferrite in the Physics Department has supplied a large number of magnets for the province's simple iron ore concentrators, which can greatly increase the iron content of the raw ore, thus solving an important technical key problem in iron smelting. It is currently being promoted and applied throughout the province. There are many other examples in other departments and cannot be listed exhaustively. In short, scientific research has been widely linked and collaborated with factories and communes, and scientific research has become a mass movement in which all teachers and students participate enthusiastically. All of this has been widely launched throughout the university, thus greatly changing the past erroneous tendencies of being detached from production and the masses. At the same time, in terms of teaching, the method of "more, faster, better, and more economical" has also been tested and successfully implemented. For example, the teaching of ordinary Russian completes the teaching content of the past one and a half years in half a year or a year, and the effect is greatly improved. Intermediate physics experiments complete the homework of the past twelve hours in eight hours per week inside and outside the classroom, and the quality is even higher than before. In order to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" in education, the university has also held various short-term training courses (such as linear programming, radio, barium ferrite technology, etc.), amateur universities and amateur graduate programs in liberal arts and sciences. Some departments have also established amateur middle schools for people's communes and sent teachers to communes to teach. Although these are just examples of one school, they are enough to prove the great correctness of Chairman Mao's educational thought and the infinite vitality of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

However, in the context of the continuous leap forward throughout the 1960s, we must further deepen the educational revolution in order to meet the requirements of China's great development of industry and agriculture. As Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report, "According to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, the continuous reform of production relations and the superstructure opens up broad avenues for the continuous development of productive forces. The continuous development of productive forces, in turn, forces the production relations and the superstructure to undergo continuous reform." This is the principle of combining the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development expounded by Chairman Mao, and it is also the theoretical basis for the continuous and in-depth revolution of education, which is a part of the superstructure. As long as we firmly rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to the Party's educational policy, and adhere to the policy of combining popularization and improvement, we will surely be able to continue to make great leaps forward in education.

From the previous stage of work, we have proved that teaching work can fully implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." However, these are only limited to experiments on a few courses. In the future, to deepen the educational revolution, we must carry out comprehensive and thorough reforms in education plans, textbook content, and teaching methods. And the reforms in these three aspects are interrelated and combined.

The reform of education plans should be considered comprehensively from primary education, secondary education, and higher education. The Chinese Mathematical Society has put forward very good reform opinions on the outdated content and repeated waste in our country's past mathematics education, such as algebraization of arithmetic, analytical geometry, and the lowering of calculus to middle schools, which can greatly shorten the years of primary and secondary schools while improving the mathematics level of universities. I believe that other courses in the education plan (physics, chemistry, biology, foreign languages, etc.) should also be considered as a whole and arranged comprehensively to form a complete set of "more, faster, better, and more economical" education plans. Productive labor should be more closely integrated with each course in the education plan to form an organic whole, so that students can not only get labor training but also enrich their perceptual knowledge from practice. A large amount of scientific research can also be carried out in conjunction with productive labor. Some schools are now experimenting with the "part-work, part-study" system in productive labor; other schools are considering completing the teaching of the past four years in the first three years of the five-year university education, a one-year labor internship, and completing the education of a two-year graduate student in the final year; these are all worth studying and experimenting with.

I would like to focus on the issue of physics teaching. Since liberation, we have carried out a series of teaching reforms in physics. In physics teaching, we have paid attention to implementing the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, strengthening the content of combining with production practice, and strengthening experimental training and production internships. But on the whole, the reform is still far from enough. From the free airing of views and debates in the Physics Department of Shandong University, we summarized the following shortcomings:

First: Emphasizing the ancient and belittling the modern, outdated and repetitive. Starting from the classical mechanics of the eighteenth century and talking about the early quantum mechanics of the twentieth century, it has already taken up seven-eighths of the four years of university, while the latest content of modern physics can only be slightly taught in the specialization courses of the last semester, which is neither comprehensive nor in-depth. Students know very little about many things in modern physics that have been widely used and have almost become common sense (such as the application of isotopes, ultrasonic waves, semiconductors, etc.). Many old and simple physical experiments are still retained in university laboratories (for example, gravitational acceleration has become common sense, but several experiments still have to be done). From junior high school, high school to the physics department of the university, physics has been studied a total of five times, and many old things have been taught over and over again, repeated and intersected, wasting a lot of time and energy. Physics is developing very fast, and the content is getting more and more. "Spending one's whole life studying the classics," when will we catch up with the modern era?

Second: Theory is detached from practice, and teaching is detached from production. Science must serve socialist construction, and theory should come from practice. However, our physics teaching often overemphasizes the theoretical system, cultivating students' habit of emphasizing theory and neglecting practice, thinking that theory is superior and unwilling to do things. The leap forward development of our country's socialist construction has put forward countless topics for physics and other sciences. In our physics teaching, there is still very little content that combines with these production realities, so that students (in fact, many teachers are also like this) cannot deeply understand the close relationship between physics and socialist construction. In productive labor and internships, when encountering practical problems, there are often very few solutions and they are in a passive position. Through productive labor and large-scale scientific research in the past two years, this phenomenon has been initially corrected, but it has not been fundamentally resolved.

Third: The guiding ideology of physics is the philosophy of dialectical materialism. In physics teaching, the implementation of the viewpoint of dialectical materialism is often divided into several prominent issues and carried out by criticizing idealism. (For example, the criticism of the idealistic viewpoint of the uncertainty principle, the criticism of the viewpoint of energism, etc.) Although this is correct, it lacks a systematic and complete viewpoint and is easily formed into criticism for the sake of criticism or implementation for the sake of implementation.

Fourth: Teaching methods are generally still sticking to conventions and there is not much reform. Classroom lectures and laboratory experiments take up most of the time each week. Students spend less time studying, thinking, and practicing repeatedly outside of class, which is not in line with the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

To deepen the revolution in physics teaching, we must take resolute measures in response to the above shortcomings. I am considering the following items:

First, emphasize the modern and belittle the ancient, and delete unnecessary repetitions. For example, junior high school and high school physics should be integrated, part of university general physics should be lowered, theoretical physics and general physics should be integrated, etc. Vigorously streamline the content of classical physics and increase the theoretical and experimental content of modern physics. This can save a lot of time.

Second, comprehensively and systematically implement the viewpoint of dialectical materialism. Recompile various teaching materials with dialectical materialism as the guideline.

Third, closely integrate with the actual situation of socialist construction in our country. Through the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, students can further clarify that the development process of physics is the process of mutual combination and mutual promotion of science and production. Physics has infinitely broad space in socialist construction. Studying physics must be used to serve socialist construction.

Fourth, break the old conventions and habits in teaching, and adopt a variety of teaching methods that combine with reality (such as on-site teaching, learning and applying, visits and internships, summary discussions, single-subject advancement, etc.). Experimental internships should be more closely integrated with productive labor, and the latest technology should be mastered through practical operation.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our country is continuing to leap forward at a rapid pace. In the magnificent movement of the technological revolution, the high tide of educational revolution and cultural revolution has arrived. I fully believe that in the near future, China's education will appear in the most advanced form and content, and physics, like other sciences, will shine brightly in socialist construction.

### 物理教学必须改革  郭贻诚代表的发言

    物理教学必须改革
    郭贻诚代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意并且拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，和谭震林副总理关于为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而斗争的报告。这几个报告总结了我国1959年继续大跃进的胜利，提出了1960年全面大跃进的宏伟规划，使我感到无限兴奋鼓舞。在总路线的光辉照耀下，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指导下，我国六亿人民一定能遵循着党中央和毛主席所领导的正确道路，继续不断地跃进。
    我是个教育工作者，多年在高等学校工作。请允许我就教育革命问题谈谈个人的体会。
    两年以来，我国高等教育事业有了很大发展。在贯彻党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的实践中，教育质量有了很大提高，广大师生的思想面貌也有了显著的改变。以我所工作的山东大学为例。自1958年末迁校济南以来，在省委和校党委的正确领导下，仅仅一年多时间系和专业的数目增加了一倍，学生数目也大大增加。在师资与设备不充分的情况下，有的系（例如物理系）白手起家，教师和同学共同努力，短时间内开设了几个专业和专门化，并且迅速发展为几个系，以适应为国家培养干部的需要。学校兴办了好几个工厂，直接为本省的工农业建设服务，并且成为学生的生产劳动基地。全校的科学研究项目数以千计，其中绝大部分是与本省或全国的生产建设结合的项目。例如数学系的线性规划研究就为本省的物资调运工作解决了许多问题，为国家节约了几千万元资金（人民日报已有详细报道）；质量控制的研究也为本省纺织工业解决了若干问题。物理系的钡铁氧体大量生产为本省的简易铁矿选矿机供应了大量磁铁的需要，可以大大提高原矿砂的含铁量，因而解决了炼铁上的一个重要技术关键问题，目前正在全省推广应用。其他各系的例子甚多，不能遍举。总之科学研究工作已经广泛地与工厂和公社挂钩协作，科学研究工作成为全体师生参加的热火朝天的群众运动，这一切已经在全校范围内普遍展开，因而大大改变了过去脱离生产，脱离群众的错误偏向。同时在教学方面也开始试验了多快好省的方法，得到成功。例如普通俄语教学以半年或一年时间完成过去一年半的教学内容，并且效果大大提高，中级物理实验以每周课内外八小时的时间完成过去十二小时的作业，质量还比以前提高。为了贯彻教育事业上的两条腿走路方针，学校还举办了各种短期训练班（如线性规划，无线电，钡铁氧体工艺等），文理科的业余大学和业余研究生。有的系还为人民公社办了业余中学，抽出教师到公社去教课。这些虽然只是一个学校的例子，但已足以证明毛主席的教育思想的伟大正确，和总路线、大跃进、人民公社的无限生命力。
    但是在整个六十年代连续跃进的形势下，我们还必须进一步深入开展教育革命，才能适应我国工农业大发展的要求。正如李富春副总理在报告中所指出的，“根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。而生产力的不断发展，又迫使生产关系和上层建筑不能不进行不断的改革。”这是毛主席所阐明的马克思列宁主义关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的原理，也正是教育这一上层建筑必须逐步深入地不断革命的理论根据。只要我们坚决依靠党的领导，坚持党的教育方针，坚持普及和提高相结合的方针，我们就一定能够在教育事业上继续大跃进。
    我们从前一阶段的工作中，已经证明了教学工作完全可以贯彻多快好省的方针。但这些还只限于对少数课程的试验。今后要深入开展教育革命，必须从教育计划、教材内容、和教学方法等方面全面地彻底地进行改革。而这三方面的改革是互相联系互相结合的。
    教育计划的改革应该从小学教育，中学教育，和高等教育全面考虑。中国数学学会对于我国过去数学教育中的陈腐内容、重复浪费现象曾经提出了很好的改革意见，例如算术代数化，几何解析化，微积分下放中学等等，就可以大大缩短中小学的年限，同时提高高等学校的数学水平。我认为教育计划中其他课程（物理、化学、生物、外国语等）也应通盘考虑，全面安排，做成一整套的多快好省的教育计划。生产劳动应该与教育计划中的各门课程更密切地结合起来，组成一个有机体，使学生既可以得到劳动锻炼，也可以从实践中丰富感性知识。结合生产劳动还可以进行大量的科学研究。现在有的学校试行生产劳动中的“半工半读”制；也有学校考虑五年大学教育中前三年完成过去四年的教学，劳动实习一年，最后一年完成二年研究生的教育；这些都很值得研究试行。
    我想着重谈谈物理教学的问题。解放以来，我们曾经进行了一系列物理学上的教学改革。在物理教学中注重贯彻辩证唯物主义的观点，加强了结合生产实际的内容，加强了实验的训练和生产实习。但总的看来，改革还是非常不够的，从山东大学物理系的鸣放辩论中，我们总结了以下几个缺点：
    第一：厚古薄今，陈旧重复。从十八世纪的经典力学讲起，讲到二十世纪的量子力学初期，已经占去了四年大学的八分之七的时间，而近代物理的最新内容只能在最后一个学期的专门化课程中略为讲授，既不全面，也不深透。许多近代物理中已经被广泛应用，几乎成为常识的东西（例如同位素的应用，超声波、半导体等等），学生了解很少。内容古老，方法简单的物理实验仍有许多保留在大学的实验室里（例如重力加速度已成常识，还要做几个实验）。由初中、高中到大学物理系，物理一共学了五次，许多古老的东西讲了一遍又一遍，重复交叉，浪费时间精力不少。物理学的发展很快，内容愈来愈多，“皓首穷经”，何时赶上现代？
    第二：理论脱离实际，教学脱离生产。科学必须为社会主义建设服务，理论应该从实践中来。而我们的物理教学往往过分强调理论系统，养成同学偏重理论，轻视实践的习惯，认为理论高人一等，不愿动手。我国社会主义建设的飞跃发展，给物理学和其他科学提出了无数的课题。在我们的物理教学中，结合这些生产实际的内容还很少，使学生（其实许多教师也是如此）不能深刻体会物理学与社会主义建设的密切关系，在生产劳动和实习中，遇到实际问题，往往办法很少，处于被动。两年来通过生产劳动和大搞科学研究，这种现象已经初步得到了纠正，但还未根本解决。
    第三：物理学的指导思想是辩证唯物主义的哲学。在物理教学中，贯彻辩证唯物主义的观点，往往是分割在几个突出问题上，采用批判唯心主义的方法来进行。（例如测不准原理的唯心观点的批判，唯能论观点的批判等等）这虽然是对的，但因此缺乏系统的完整的观点，容易形成为批判而批判或是为贯彻而贯彻。
    第四：教学方法一般还是墨守陈规，改革不大。课堂讲授和实验室做实验，占去每周大部分时间。同学在课外钻研思考，反复实践的时间较少，不符合多快好省的方针。
    要深入物理教学的革命，必须针对以上缺点，采取坚决措施。我考虑有以下几项：
    第一，厚今薄古，删除不必要的重复。例如初中和高中物理打通，一部分大学普通物理下放，理论物理与普通物理打通等等。大力精简经典物理的内容，增加近代物理的理论与实验内容。这样就可以大大节约时间。
    第二，全面系统地贯彻辩证唯物主义的观点。以辩证唯物主义思想为纲，重编各种教材。
    第三，密切结合我国的社会主义建设实际。通过教学、生产劳动、科学研究的三结合，使学生进一步明确物理学的发展过程就是科学与生产互相结合互相推进的过程。物理学在社会主义建设中有无限广阔的天地。学物理学必须用来为社会主义建设服务。
    第四，打破教学上的陈规旧习，采取结合实际的多种多样的教学方法（如现场教学，边学边用，参观实习，总结讨论，单科独进等等）。实验实习更要多多结合生产劳动，从实际操作中掌握最新技术。
    我们国家在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，正在以飞快的速度，继续跃进。在波澜壮阔的技术革命运动中，教育革命与文化革命的高潮已经到来。我完全相信，在不久的将来，我国教育事业，必将以最先进的形式和内容出现，而物理学和其他科学一样也必将在社会主义建设中大放异彩。
