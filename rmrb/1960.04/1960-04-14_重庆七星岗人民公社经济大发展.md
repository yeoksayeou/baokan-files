Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 13th: The Qixinggang People's Commune in Chongqing, organized mainly by street residents, has achieved remarkable results in developing production by adhering to the principle of self-reliance since its establishment in September 1958, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority and vitality of urban people's communes. Of the more than 19,000 households in the Qixinggang People's Commune, street residents account for over 75%. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, these street residents, under the leadership of the Party organization, established 148 factories mainly engaged in repairing and manufacturing small production tools and daily necessities. They also established a transportation team to undertake short-distance transportation in the urban area, and organized some businesses to serve the lives of residents. However, these scattered small factories had simple equipment, lacked funds, and had low technical levels, resulting in small output. In September of the same year, the Party organization here, in response to the demands of the masses, actively led the masses to establish the People's Commune. After its establishment, the commune leveraged its advantages in better organizing the production, life, and study of the masses, and in facilitating cooperation with large enterprises. It rectified the factories and other production units established by street residents before the establishment of the commune, and actively developed production according to the principle of self-reliance, rapidly changing the face of the commune's production units. The total output value of the commune's industry has increased from about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month at the beginning of its establishment to about 3 million yuan per month currently. The total output value of the commune's industry in 1959 increased by 11.7 times compared to 1958, and the total output value completed in the first quarter of this year is equal to two-thirds of the total output value of the entire last year.

After the establishment of the Qixinggang People's Commune, it rapidly improved the production equipment capacity of the commune-run industry, adhering to the principles of making use of simple and crude methods and starting from scratch. At the beginning of the commune's establishment, among the original 100-plus factories, only one broken lathe could be considered a relatively large piece of equipment, and the rest were only some scattered and dilapidated manual tools. The commune adjusted and merged these 100-plus factories into 53, so that the existing equipment could be concentrated to play a greater role. It also organized commune members to visit large factories and imitate and trial-produce some equipment. They also invited people from large factories to provide technical guidance, and self-made and transformed more than 1,000 large, medium, and small pieces of equipment, such as various lathes, drilling machines, motors, wire drawing machines, and spring hammers. The commune also actively expanded public accumulation and gradually purchased some relatively large machinery and equipment. At present, the number of "indigenous equipment" in the commune's industry has increased from 320 at the beginning of the commune's establishment to more than 1,500, and there are also relatively "modern" large-scale equipment. There are 21 large-scale equipment such as various lathes, planers, milling machines, drilling machines, electric wire drawing machines, and electric yarn covering machines alone. Since the beginning of this year, the commune has also launched a large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, realizing more than 20,800 innovation proposals in the first quarter. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the commune's industry has been significantly improved, and there are also 12 automatic and semi-automatic mechanical equipment, and one production linkage line and one assembly line each. Now the commune's production is rapidly increasing, and it has overfulfilled the production plan by 44% in the first quarter. This commune also adopted the method of using talents according to their abilities and actively cultivating them to overcome the difficulties of lacking technical strength through self-reliance. After the establishment of the commune, it rearranged the work and production time of commune members according to their labor strength and technical level, and assigned some people with certain skills to various production units to serve as technical backbones; those without skills were also arranged in appropriate positions to strengthen their training. The commune also successively sent more than 300 people to large factories for short-term "apprenticeships"; and invited more than 30 master craftsmen from large factories to the commune to train commune members for short periods; organized more than 1,000 people to go to large factories to "learn from experience"; and adopted methods such as skilled workers leading novices, learning what is lacking, and using what is learned in the factory to improve the technical level of workers. At present, the commune members in each production unit have mastered certain skills, and the commune-run factories can produce more than 1,500 kinds of products, and the product quality is also very good.

This commune has adopted the method of "searching in many ways, collecting from everyone, and unified distribution by the commune" to fully find and utilize urban waste and scrap materials and the leftover materials from large factories to overcome the difficulty of insufficient production raw materials. According to incomplete statistics, last year they mobilized commune members to find raw materials and linked up with waste recycling stations, and collected more than 250 tons of leftover materials and urban waste and scrap materials from large factories, such as silicon steel sheets, steel, tinplate, lead, and caustic soda, more than 15,000 meters of leather, and more than 900,000 catties of waste cotton yarn. After these materials were uniformly distributed to various factories by the commune, they produced more than 100 kinds of products such as various models, fluorescent lamp rectifiers, building tools, and mine batteries. Last year, the printing and finishing factory of this commune used waste oil yarn from large factories for wiping machines, and after pounding, washing, and bleaching, produced more than 70 tons of wiping yarn, and also steamed and refined three tons of "recycled oil" for supply to large factories. After re-elasticizing waste cotton wadding, they made more than 7,000 quilts for mats and wrapping machines in the fourth quarter of last year.

The rapid development of the Qixinggang People's Commune has greatly exploited the potential of human and material resources in the city, transforming consumers into producers, turning waste materials into useful materials, and effectively implementing the principle of urban people's communes serving state-owned large factories, suburban agriculture, and the people's lives.

In the past year or so, the products processed and manufactured by the commune's factories include more than 1,500 kinds of small production tools, screws, nails, rectifiers, as well as towels, cloth shoes, and chicken intestine belts. The commune-run factories also actively repair accessories for state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, and have actually become an auxiliary workshop for state-owned factories and enterprises, playing a role in filling gaps and making up deficiencies. In terms of supporting agriculture, in the past year or so, the commune-run industry has produced more than 80 tons of chemical fertilizer ferrous sulfate, and has also manufactured a large number of agricultural tools and repaired many tractors and automobiles. Because the commune-run industry has great flexibility, it has also played a positive role in increasing the production of urgently needed daily necessities and regulating market supply. For example, when the market needed soap, the commune-run factories timely used local raw materials and substitutes to manufacture a large number of washing powder; when the market needed wood packaging utensils, the commune-run factories immediately used waste wood boards and cardboard to manufacture them in large quantities for market supply.

The rapid development of production has also driven the development of collective welfare undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings in the entire commune. After commune members participated in production, the income of general families has increased by about one time compared to before the establishment of the commune, and more than 90% of residents have savings. The collective welfare undertakings of the commune have also developed accordingly. At present, the commune has established 41 public canteens, and the number of people joining the canteens accounts for 91% of the total number of commune members. The commune has also established 216 various childcare organizations, and the number of children enrolled in childcare accounts for more than 95% of the total number of children in the commune. In addition, the commune has completely eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and has initially established a spare-time education system from primary school to university. The mental outlook of commune members has also undergone great changes. The new ethos of caring for the collective, loving labor, harmonious and united families, and mutual assistance and friendship among neighbors has been universally established. Commune members praised the People's Commune, saying: "The People's Commune is a red sun, shining on the happy commune members; starting from scratch to run factories, men and women are busy with production, there is a new atmosphere everywhere in the streets, and we will always follow the Communist Party."

    贯彻为国营大工厂、郊区农业和人民生活服务的方针
    重庆七星岗人民公社经济大发展
    社办工业拥有土洋设备一千多台，利用废料生产产品一千五百多种，月产值三百万元集体福利事业相应发展，青壮年文盲全部扫除，关心集体、热爱劳动新风尚普遍树立
    新华社重庆13日电　重庆市以街道居民为主组织起来的七星岗人民公社，1958年9月成立以来，坚持自力更生的方针发展生产，取得了显著成绩，显示了城市人民公社的无比优越性和生命力。七星岗人民公社的一万九千多户社员中，街道居民占75％以上。在1958年大跃进中，这些街道居民在党组织的领导下，建立了一百四十八个以修配和制造小型生产工具和生活用品为主的工厂，并且成立了承担市区短途运输的运输队，还举办了一些为居民生活服务的业务。但是，这些分散的小型工厂设备简陋，资金缺乏，技术水平很低，产量也很小。同年9月，这里的党组织根据群众的要求，积极领导群众建立了人民公社。公社成立以后，就发挥了它能更好地组织群众的生产、生活、学习和更便于和大企业协作等优越性，对建社前街道居民举办的工厂和其他生产单位进行了整顿，并且根据自力更生的方针积极地发展生产，使全社的生产单位迅速改变了面貌。社办工业的生产总值，已由刚建社时的每月四、五万元提高到目前的每月三百万元左右。1959年社办工业的生产总值，比1958年增加了十一点七倍，今年第一季度完成的总产值又等于去年全年总产值的三分之二。
    七星岗人民公社成立以后，根据因陋就简、白手起家的方针，迅速地提高社办工业的生产设备能力。公社建立初期，原有的一百多个工厂中除一台破车床算是较大型的设备外，其余只有一些零星破旧的手工工具。公社把这一百多个工厂调整合并为五十三个，使现有设备集中起来发挥更大的作用，又组织社员到大工厂去参观，模仿试制一些设备。他们还请大工厂派人做技术指导，自制和改造了各种车床、钻床、马达、拉丝机、弹簧锤等较大的和各种中小型的设备一千多台。公社还积极扩大公共积累，逐步购置了一些比较大的机器设备。目前全社工业中的“土设备”已由建社初的三百二十台增加到一千五百多台，而且有了较“洋”的大型设备。仅各种车床、刨床、铣床、钻床、电动拉丝机、电动包纱机等大型设备就有二十一台。今年以来，全社又大搞技术革新和技术革命，第一季度就实现了革新建议两万零八百多项。目前，全社工业中机械化和半机械化的程度有了显著提高，还有自动和半自动的机械设备十二台，生产联动线和作业线各一条。现在全社的生产迅速上升，第一季度超额44％完成了生产计划。这个公社还采取量才使用、积极培养的办法，自力更生地克服缺乏技术力量的困难。公社成立后，就按照社员劳动力强弱和技术水平高低的情况，重新安排社员的工作和生产时间，把一些有一定技术的人派到各生产单位中担任技术骨干；没有技术的人也安排到适当岗位上，加强对他们的培养。公社还先后派出三百多人到大厂去短期“学艺”；并且请了三十多位大厂的老师傅到社里来短期训练社员；组织了一千多人到大厂去“取经”；在厂内还采取了熟手带生手、缺啥学啥、学了就用等办法来提高工人的技术水平。目前，各个生产单位上的社员，都掌握了一定的技术，社办工厂已经能生产一千五百多种产品，产品质量也很好。
    这个公社采取了“多方找、大家集、公社统一分配”的办法，来充分寻找和利用城市废旧物资和大厂的边角余料，克服生产原料不足的困难。据不完全统计，去年他们发动社员人人寻找原料材料并且与废品收购站挂钩，收集到的大厂的边角余料和城市的废旧物资，就有矽钢片、钢材、马口铁、铅、烧碱等二百五十多吨，皮革一万五千多米，废棉纱九十多万斤。这些物资由公社统一分配给各个工厂以后，制出了各种模型、日光灯整流器，建筑工具、矿山电瓶等一百多种产品。这个公社的印花整制加工厂，去年利用各大厂擦机器的废油纱，经过捶洗、漂白后，就生产了七十多吨擦机纱，还蒸煮提炼了三吨多“再生油”供应大工厂。他们把废旧棉絮重新弹制以后，去年第四季度就做了用于作垫子、包机器的棉絮七千多床。
    七星岗人民公社由于生产迅速发展，大大发挥了城市中人力、物力的潜力，变消费者为生产者，化废弃物资为有用物资，有力地贯彻了城市人民公社的生产为国营大工厂、郊区农业和人民生活服务的方针。
    一年多来，公社工厂加工、制造的产品，有小型生产工具、螺丝、洋钉、整流器，以及毛巾、便鞋、鸡肠带等一千五百多种。社办工厂还积极为国营工矿修理配件，实际上已经成为国营工厂企业的一个辅助车间，起到了填空补缺的作用。在支援农业方面，一年多来，社办工业生产的化学肥料青矾就有八十多吨，还制造了大批农具，修配了许多拖拉机和汽车。因为社办工业灵活性大，对增加当前急需的日用小商品生产，调节市场供应也起了积极的作用。例如，市场需要肥皂的时候，社办工厂就及时利用土原料和代用品制造了大批洗衣粉；市场需要木材包装用具，社办工厂就立即利用废木板、纸版大量制造，供应市场。
    生产的迅速发展，又带动了全社集体福利事业和文化教育事业的发展，社员参加生产以后，一般家庭的收入都比建社前提高了一倍左右，90％以上居民有了存款。公社的集体福利事业也相应地发展了。目前公社办了四十一个公共食堂，入伙人数占社员总数的91％。公社还办了各种托儿组织二百一十六个，入托儿童占全社儿童总数的95％以上。此外，公社已全部扫除了青壮年文盲，并且初步建立了从小学到大学的业余教育体系。社员的精神面貌也起了很大变化。关心集体、热爱劳动、家庭和睦团结、邻里互助友爱的新风尚已普遍树立。社员们歌颂人民公社说：“人民公社红太阳，照着社员喜洋洋；白手起家办工厂，男男女女生产忙，街道处处新气象，永远跟着共产党”。
