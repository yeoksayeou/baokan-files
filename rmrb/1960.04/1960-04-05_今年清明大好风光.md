Great Spring Scenery This Year During Qingming

　　Land Universally Under Square Field System

　　The landscape of the Wangdu Town People's Commune in Tang County, Hebei Province, has undergone tremendous changes: in previous years, the proportion of high-yield squares in cultivated land was very small, but this year, before Qingming, the land has universally realized the square field system. More than 160,000 mu of land in the whole commune has been uniformly divided into more than 50 different "square fields", achieving "ditches connected, squares linked", and realizing the "square fieldization" of the land. Six high-yield squares in the whole commune have completely achieved high-standard garden-style fields, and standardized tillage methods have been adopted in the squares. Generally, each mu is divided into ten ridges, and the neat ridges and straight canals are interspersed together, naturally forming a beautiful pattern. Now large areas of square fields are being prepared for sowing.

　　Overcoming the Drought Demon and Finishing Planting Early

　　The people's communes in the suburbs of Baiyin City, Gansu Province, give full play to the power of large numbers of people, doing everything possible to fight drought, prevent drought, conserve moisture, create moisture, and carry out rush planting. By April 2nd, the city had completed the spring sowing task 4% over the target, twelve days earlier than in previous years – before Qingming, sowing 465,000 mu of various crops such as spring wheat, an increase of 28% over last year's spring sowing area.

　　It is rare in the local past to be able to finish planting spring crops before Qingming under the conditions of sparse rain and snow and relatively serious spring drought. The incomparably powerful power of the people's commune is an important factor in Baiyin suburbs' victory over drought and early completion of spring sowing this year. When the spring drought appeared, the Baiyin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately led the communes to launch a vigorous movement to dig underground water, ensuring water for spring sowing. After the sowing began, each people's commune properly arranged manpower and animal power, and organized 157 spring irrigation professional teams and 394 spring sowing professional teams to carry out large-scale cooperation in mountainous and plain areas. Therefore, the early completion of spring sowing was guaranteed.

　　Increased Mechanical Farm Tools

　　Thirteen tractors and many semi-mechanized farm tools pulled by animal power are running in the newly thawed fields of Kangjin People's Commune in Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province. This year, the commune has increased the number of mechanized and semi-mechanized farm tools. The commune members used these machines to finish planting spring wheat before Qingming. At present, they are stepping up ploughing and harrowing to actively prepare for the sowing of autumn crops. Since the beginning of spring, the whole commune has created and promoted more than 10,000 various farm tools such as "universal harrows", "double-ridge sowing and shovel-weeding machines", and "sowing machine plus manure box". The reform of these tools has enabled the mechanization and semi-mechanization of spring ploughing production in the whole commune to reach about 50% this year.

　　Only Sowing in the Past, Now Extremely Busy

　　In the past, the Huaxi People's Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang City had to wait until Qingming Festival to start spring sowing, but now it has entered the busy season of spring sowing. At present, the commune's ten tractors are stepping up ploughing and harrowing, and more than two hundred ox and horse carts are also constantly shuttling back and forth on the field roads, transporting fertilizer day and night. By the eve of Qingming, all the flat fields in the whole commune had been ploughed twice; more than 3,000 mu of seedling fields had been ploughed five times and harrowed four times, and rice seeds had been sown; more than 9,000 mu of vegetables and 14,000 mu of corn had been transplanted and sown, about one month earlier than in previous years.

　　Poor Team with High Aspirations, Lagging Behind in Season

　　The Guanshan Production Brigade of the Chudong People's Commune in Chuxian County, Anhui Province, determined to catch up with the rich team, adhering to the spirit of "to catch up with the rich team, first catch up with the season", seized the opportunity before Qingming and rushed to do farm work. On March 30th, it rained non-stop and there was a Force 6 wind, with the temperature dropping to about two degrees, but all 695 commune members of the whole brigade were in high spirits and fully attended work. The nineteen members of the Yaofu Production Team braved the cold wind to work in the fields, ploughing an average of 2.5 mu of land per person that day.

### 今年清明大好风光

    今年清明大好风光
    大地普遍方田化
    河北唐县望都镇人民公社的大地面貌发生了巨大变化：往年丰产方占耕地的比重很少，今年清明未到，大地普遍实现了方田化。全社十六万多亩土地，已统一划成了五十多个不同的“方田”，达到了“沟渠相通、方方相连”，实现了大地“方田化”。全社有六个丰产方，完全实现了高标准园田化，方内采用了规格化的整地方法，一般每亩划分十个畦，整齐的畦田和笔直的水渠交嵌在一起，自然地形成了一幅美丽的图案。现在大面积方田正准备播种。
        战胜旱魔提前种完地
    甘肃白银市郊各人民公社充分发挥人多势众的威力，千方百计，抗旱防旱，保墒造墒，突击春播。到4月2日，全市已比往年提前十二天——在清明以前超额4％完成了春播任务，共播种春麦等各种作物四十六万五千亩，比去年春播面积扩大了28％。
    在雨雪稀少春旱比较严重的情况下，能在清明以前种完春播作物，在当地过去是少见的。人民公社强大无比的威力，是白银市郊区今年战胜干旱提前完成春播的重要因素。春旱露头时，中共白银市委即领导各公社开展了轰轰烈烈的大挖地下水的运动，保证了春播用水。播种开始后，各人民公社都妥善安排了人力、畜力，组织了一百五十七个春灌专业队和三百九十四个春播专业队，分头突击展开山、川地区的大协作。因而保证了春播提前完成。
          机械农具增多
    十三台拖拉机和很多部畜力牵引的半机械化农具，正在黑龙江呼兰县康金人民公社刚刚解冻的田地里奔驰。今年这个公社机械化和半机械化的农具增多了。社员们使用这些机具在清明以前就种完了春麦，目前正加紧耕地耙地，为大秋作物播种积极进行准备。入春以来，全公社创造和推广了“万能耙”、“双垅播种、铲趟机”、“播种机加粪箱”等各种农具一万多件。这些工具的改革，使全社今年春耕生产的机械化、半机械化程度能达到50％左右。
    往年才撒种  今年已大忙
    贵阳市郊花溪人民公社，往年要等清明节才开始春播，现在却已进入了春播大忙季节。目前，这个公社的十台拖拉机正在加紧翻犁耙地，二百多部牛、马车也日夜不停地在田间大道上往返运送肥料。到清明前夕，全公社所有的板田板土，都已经翻犁了二道；三千多亩秧田都做到了五犁四耙，撒下了谷种；有九千多亩蔬菜和一万四千多亩玉米，已经移栽和播种，春播时间比往年提早一个月左右。
    穷队志气高　季节落在后
    安徽滁县滁东人民公社决心猛赶富队的官山生产大队，以“要赶富队，先要赶季节”的精神，在清明前夕，抓紧时机，抢干农活。3月30日这天，雨不停点，又刮着六级大风，气温降到二度左右，可是全大队六百九十五个社员，个个精神抖擞，全部出勤干活。腰甫生产队十九个社员，冒着寒风下水耕田，当天平均每人耕田二亩五分。
