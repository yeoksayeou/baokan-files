The experience of our Luomen People's Commune is:
	People have infinite wisdom, water has inexhaustible potential, and the People's Commune has tremendous superiority.

Comrade Representatives, Comrades:

	I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Now, I will talk about the situation of our Luomen People's Commune in Wushan County, Gansu Province, developing rural hydropower and comprehensively utilizing water energy through self-reliance.

	After Wushan County diverted water to Dongliang Mountain and built the Dongliang Canal, it also built a hydropower station with the help of the state, using the Dongliang Canal water. The Dongliang Canal and Dongliang Power Station brought happiness to Dongliang Mountain and illuminated the hearts of more than 80,000 farmers in Luomen. In the past year or so, we have also diverted the water of the Wei River, Nan River, Nie River, and Xi River to Zhongliang, Xiaozhongliang, Nanliang, and Beiling. In Luomen, we have built a canal network spanning three ridges and covering mountains and rivers, turning dry land into irrigated land and increasing grain production across the board. However, we were not satisfied with just diverting water to the mountains. After getting grain from the water, we became even more ambitious and motivated, and then we demanded electricity, tools, and labor from the water, further utilizing water and electricity to advance towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. Now, we have built sixteen hydropower stations with a generating capacity of 760 kilowatts, and twelve more are about to be completed, which can generate 850 kilowatts. At the same time, we have also created and promoted more than one hundred kinds of water-powered tools.

	Due to the availability of water, electricity, and the extensive comprehensive utilization of water energy, the Luomen Commune is already different from what it was a year ago. In production, steelmaking, agricultural tool manufacturing, papermaking, grass cutting, sawing wood, threshing, flour milling, oil pressing, cotton ginning, weaving, etc., and in life, lighting, boiling water, cooking, cutting vegetables, and even treating diseases, electricity has begun to be used. Many of the commune's more than 1,600 factories operate on electricity and water power. Like the machinery factory, which could only previously forge and cast pots, now utilizes our own generated electricity to achieve full mechanization and semi-mechanization in all production processes, and can produce more than thirty types of medium-sized machinery such as planers, cotton gins, noodle presses, electric motors, blowers, and ore crushers. The textile factory was still producing by hand a year ago. Now, from cotton ginning, spinning, winding, to weaving and other seven processes, all are using water energy, increasing efficiency by 20 to 40 times, and saving more than 18,000 labor units per year. According to nineteen major water-powered machines, the commune can save 1.27 million labor and animal power units per year, enhance agricultural production, and greatly reduce physical labor. In agriculture, we have manufactured artificial rainmakers and seven types of sprinkler irrigation devices, including conical, drum-shaped, and water-gun types; we have also developed water-powered high-line transportation. In the past, we only said, "Cultivating land does not require cattle, lighting lamps does not require oil." Now we have already tried using electric plows to plow the land, and more than 3,600 households in the commune have installed electric lights. Everyone happily says, "Every team has built a hydropower station, a river of happiness falls into the world, milling rice and grinding flour during the day, reading books under the lamp at night." Our days are getting better and better, and everyone's enthusiasm is getting stronger and stronger. According to preliminary calculations, if the existing water resources of the commune are fully utilized, sixty-five hydropower stations can be built, of which five are relatively large. We will strive to complete all these power stations within this year. At that time, the power generation can reach 5,000 kilowatts, which can not only solve all the electricity needs of industry, but also realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agriculture in plowing, harrowing, sowing, irrigating, weeding, and harvesting.

	When we were building hydropower stations and developing the comprehensive utilization of water energy, we were also hindered by some people, just like when we were diverting water to the mountains. They said, "Power stations cannot be built in one breath," "The funds, technology, labor, and equipment cannot be solved at all," and that it was "thinking of picking stars from the sky" for farmers to run power plants. However, no difficulties have stopped us. In fact, our power stations have been built, and we will continue to build them. So how did we build them? First of all, it is because we listened to the Party's words, acted in accordance with the Party's general line for socialist construction, and had the "large-scale and public" People's Commune. At the same time, in the Great Leap Forward, our Luomen people further liberated their minds, carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and created many indigenous and simple methods. In short:

	If funds are insufficient, we adopt two methods and two steps. One is to build a hydraulic station first, and then a hydropower station. Hydraulic stations have simple equipment, cost less money, and are built quickly. They can be put into production immediately, and the income from the hydraulic station is used to build the hydropower station. After Dongliang Mountain built a hydraulic station, it drove four hemp-pressing machines and one cotton gin, and bought a 12-kilowatt generator after six months of operation. Another method is to have old stations lead new stations, and one station splits into two. Dongliang Mountain used the production accumulation of the first hydropower station to build the second hydropower station. Teams that cannot raise funds for the construction of a hydraulic station for a while, if the foundation is good, expand production and increase accumulation; if the foundation is poor, they adopt the method of team-run and commune-assisted. With the support of commune-run industries, most power stations can be self-financed and self-built.

	If there is a lack of technical personnel, we train them among our own ironworkers, carpenters, stonemasons, plasterers, and young people. We adopt methods such as "studying and learning from experience," "on-site training," "old stations lead new stations, masters lead apprentices," and establishing a combination of production, learning, and experimentation in motor schools and short-term training classes, from pilot projects to multiple pilot projects, and then to full-scale implementation. In this way, we learn while doing and do while learning, and quickly have a comprehensive technical team. Now, we have more than 1,000 technical personnel who are proficient in this field, and there are more than 250 farmer technicians who can be responsible for designing and building hydropower stations.

	If there is insufficient labor, we make overall arrangements for the labor force of the entire commune, form specialized electricity teams, and implement a combination of specialized teams and temporary assaults, doing small-scale work during busy farming seasons and large-scale work during slack farming seasons, attending work every month, and carrying out work every season. Under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we all proposed the slogan of "Starting in one day, completing in ten days, and generating electricity in half a month," and dispatched 10,000 laborers to build power stations. For example, the Guohuai Brigade built a 12-kilowatt hydropower station after five hundred people fought for three days and nights. The Longquan Team dispatched five hundred people and built a 20-kilowatt hydropower station after four days of assault. Each production team not only built small hydropower stations, but also contracted to build a medium-sized hydropower station of more than 100 kilowatts. The commune also transferred more than 4,000 people to build a large reservoir with a capacity of 2 million cubic meters on Dongliang Mountain. Another hydropower station with more than 300 kilowatts will be built on this reservoir.

	If there is a lack of equipment and power equipment, we will, in the spirit of "breaking superstitions, boldly trying, and coming again if it fails once," vigorously carry out "four-worker cooperation" of ironworkers, carpenters, stonemasons, and cement workers, "five-factory cooperation" of motor factories, machinery factories, cement factories, farm tool factories, and power plants, and mobilize workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers to work together, making what can be made, substituting what can be substituted, taking materials locally, and solving the problems ourselves. For example, without iron water turbines, farmer Lin Junyan spent forty days creating a wooden water turbine, which cost only more than 400 yuan, which was more than 8,000 yuan cheaper than buying an iron one, and it has been working well for two years. Without steel pressure pipes, we rivet them with wooden boards, or use waste steel bars and our own produced cement to pour pipes, and some even hollow out large trees from the middle to replace them. Now, the commune has hundreds of self-made water-powered integrated utilization machines such as water turbines and small motors.

	If the water power is small and cannot generate a large amount of electricity, we adopt a variety of methods, from utilizing all natural drops such as canals, reservoirs, slopes, cliffs, pits, and ridges, to artificially creating drops, and changing small drops to large drops to increase water energy. The Longquan Team built a power station with a drop of 9 meters by using the original earth pit; the Dongliang Power Station changed the original twenty-seven waterfalls to one waterfall, increasing the drop from 9 meters to 22 meters, and the power generation increased from 18 kilowatts to 36 kilowatts; the Houbao Power Station has a high drop and a small flow, so it concentrates the water from several ditches together to become a 100-kilowatt power station; in Baquan and other places where there is no drop, the method of digging pits on the ground is adopted to build hydropower stations.

	In a word, the experience of our Luomen people is: People have infinite wisdom, water has inexhaustible potential, and the People's Commune has tremendous superiority. We also deeply realize that with the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Commune, we can truly achieve happiness.

	Since the beginning of this year, Gansu has had little snow and rain, and the severe drought situation has been determined, but we Luomen have laid the foundation for overcoming the drought. We see today and also see a better future. We must continue our efforts and, under the leadership of the Party, ensure a "great harvest despite the great drought" this year, and strive to achieve agricultural mechanization at an early date.

    东梁电站照亮了洛门八万农民的心
    汪德昌代表谈武山洛门公社怎样发展水电事业
    我们洛门人民公社的经验就是：
    人有无穷智慧，水有不尽潜力，
    人民公社有天大的优越性。各位代表、各位同志：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理的报告。现在，讲一讲我们甘肃省武山县洛门人民公社自力更生发展农村水电事业和综合利用水能的情况。
    武山县把水引上东梁山，修成东梁渠之后，在国家帮助下又利用东梁渠水建成了一座水电站。东梁渠和东梁电站给东梁山带来了幸福，也照亮了洛门八万多农民的心。一年多以来，我们又把渭河、南河、聂河、西河的水引上了中梁、小中梁、南梁、北岭，在洛门修成一个横跨三岭、遍布山川的渠道网，把旱地变成水地，普遍的多打了粮食。但是，我们并没有满足于引水上山。向水要到粮食之后，雄心更强了，志气更高了，接着，又向水要电、要工具、要劳力，进一步利用水和电向机械化、半机械化进军。现在，我们已经建成水力发电站十六座，发电量有七百六十瓩，快要建成的还有十二座，可以发电八百五十瓩。同时，我们还创造和推广了一百多种水能工具。
    由于有了水，有了电和大搞综合利用水能，洛门公社已经和一年多以前不同了。生产上炼钢铁、制农具、造纸、铡草、锯木、脱粒、磨面、榨油、弹花、纺织等等和生活上照明、烧水、做饭、切菜以至治病，都开始用了电。全社的一千六百多个工厂，很多工厂是用电力和水能操作。像机械厂，原来只能打铣、铸锅，现在利用我们自己发的电全部生产实现了机械化、半机械化，能生产刨床、弹花机、压面机、电动机、鼓风机、碎矿机等中型机具三十多种；纺织厂一年以前还是手工生产，现在从弹花、纺织、倒线到织布等七道工序，全部是利用水能，提高工效二十倍到四十倍，一年可以节约一万八千多个劳动力。全社按十九种主要的水能机械计算，一年可以节约出一百二十七万个劳、畜力，增强农业生产力量，也大大减轻了体力劳动。在农业上，我们制造了人工降雨器和锥形、鼓形、水枪式七种喷灌器；还搞了水能高线运输。过去我们只是说：“耕地不用牛，点灯不用油”，如今我们已经试用电犁犁地，全社安起电灯的就有三千六百多户。大家高兴地说：“队队建起水电站，幸福银河落人间，白天碾米又磨面，晚上灯下把书念”。我们的日子真是越过越好，大家的干劲也是越鼓越足。初步计算，全社现有的水力资源，如果充分利用起来，可以建立水力发电站六十五座，其中比较大的可以建立五座。我们要把这些电站争取在今年以内全部建成，那时候，发电量可以达到五千瓩，不但可以解决工业的全部用电，农业上的耕、耙、播、灌、锄、收，也可以实现机械化和半机械化。
    在我们兴修水电站和开展综合利用水能的时候，也和引水上山一样，受到了一些人的阻挠。他们说：“电站不是一口气吹起来的”，“资金、技术、劳力和设备根本没办法解决”，说农民办电是“想摘天上的星”。但是，任何困难都没有挡住我们，事实上我们的电站已经办起来了，而且还要接着办下去。我们又是怎么办起来的呢？首先是因为我们听党的话，按照党的社会主义建设总路线办事，以及有了“一大二公”的人民公社。同时，我们洛门人民在大跃进中，也进一步解放了思想，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，创造了不少的土办法和穷办法。简单的说：
    资金不足，我们就采取两种两步走的办法。一种是先建水力站，后建水电站。水力站设备简单，花钱少，建设快，马上能投入生产，用水力站的收入建设水电站。东梁山在建成水力站以后，带动四个压麻机和一部弹花机，经营半年就买了一部十二瓩的发电机。另一种办法是老站带新站，一站分两站。东梁山就用第一座水电站的生产积累，建立了第二座水电站。一时筹集不出建设水力站资金的队，如果基础较好，就扩大生产，增加积累；基础差的就采取队办社助的办法。加上有社办工业的支援，所以一般的电站都能自筹自建。
    缺少技术人员，我们就在自己的铁工、木工、石工、泥水工和青年中培养。采取“留学取经”，“现场练兵”，“老站带新站，师傅带徒弟”和成立一边生产，一边学习，一边实验三结合的电机中学、短期训练班等办法，由一点试办到多点试办，一直到全面开花，就这样边干边学，边学边干，很快地有了一支综合性的技术队伍，现在，我们已经有精通这一行的技术人员一千多人，能够负责设计和兴建水电站的农民技术员就有二百五十多人。
    劳动力不够，我们就把全社劳力做了统筹安排，组成了电力专业队，实行专业队和临时突击相结合的办法，农忙小搞，农闲大搞，月月出勤，季季开展。在党的八届八中全会的精神鼓舞下，我们大家提出“一天上马，十天建成，半月发电”的口号，出动了一万名劳动大军兴修电站。像郭槐大队，五百人奋战三昼夜，建成一座十二瓩的水电站，龙泉队出动五百人，经过四天突击，建成一座二十瓩的水电站。每个生产队不仅兴办了小型水电站，还承办一个一百瓩以上的中型水电站。公社也抽调了四千多人，在东梁山上修成一座库容二百万方的大水库。在这个水库上再建立一座三百多瓩的水电站。
    缺少器材和动力设备，我们就本着“破除迷信，大胆尝试，一次不成，二次再来”的百折不挠的精神，大搞铁工、木工、石工、水泥工“四工协作”，电机厂、机械厂、水泥厂、农具厂、发电厂“五厂配合”，工农商学兵一齐动手，能制就制，能代就代，就地取材，自己解决。像没有铁质水轮机，农民林俊彦就用四十天的时间，创制了木质水轮机，只花了四百多元，比买铁的便宜八千多元，两年来一直用得很好。没有钢的压力水管，我们就用木板铆起来用，或者利用废钢筋和自己生产的水泥浇筑管子，有的还把大树从中间挖空来代替。现在全社自造的水能综合利用器水轮机、小型电动机等，就有好几百件。
    水力小，不能大量发电，我们就采取多种多样的办法，由利用渠道、水库、坡、崖、坑、埂等一切自然落差，到人工制造落差，把小落差改为大落差，来增加水能。龙泉队利用原来的土坑就建成了一座落差九米的电站；东梁电站把原来的二十七个跌水改为一个跌水，落差从九米提高到二十二米，发电量从十八瓩增加到三十六瓩；侯堡电站的落差高、流量小，就把几条沟渠的水集中一起，成为一个一百瓩的电站；在没有落差的百泉等地就都是采取平地挖坑的办法建立水电站。
    一句话，我们洛门人民的经验就是：人有无穷智慧，水有不尽潜力，人民公社有天大的优越性。我们也深深体会到有了共产党、毛主席，有了人民公社，才能真正得到幸福。
    今年以来，甘肃少雪缺雨，大旱局势已定，可是我们洛门已经打下了战胜干旱的基础。我们看到今天，也看到了更加美好的将来，一定再接再厉，在党的领导下，保证今年“大旱大丰收”，并且争取早日实现农业机械化。
