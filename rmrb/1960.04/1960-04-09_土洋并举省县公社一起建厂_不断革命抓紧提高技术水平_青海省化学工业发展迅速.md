Qinghai Province is vigorously developing its chemical industry by adopting the principle of “walking on two legs” with both indigenous and foreign methods. Currently, the province has built 101 chemical industrial plants and mines producing potash fertilizer, sulfuric acid, soda ash, anhydrous sodium sulfate, industrial potassium chloride, and other products. The number of chemical industrial products has increased from one in 1949 to 52. These products not only strongly support the sustained leap forward of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and basic construction in Qinghai Province, but also support other areas and exports.

Qinghai Province is particularly rich in chemical industrial resources. According to existing geological data, mineral resources such as crude salt, potassium salt, magnesium salt, brine, pyrite, natural gas, and natural alkali are almost everywhere in the province. Moreover, the reserves are large and the quality is high, with many occupying an important position nationwide. However, at the time of liberation, there was only a small factory producing seven tons of sulfuric acid per year. Many chemical industrial products needed for light and heavy industries had to be transported from other provinces, which was costly and inconvenient. Especially since 1958, with the rapid development of various constructions, the quantity and variety of chemical industrial products needed have increased. In response to the above situation, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to actively develop the chemical industry, requiring that small and simple chemical plants be actively built in places with raw materials, and that areas with conditions build some semi-indigenous and semi-foreign and foreign-method production factories. The whole province took active action. In 1958, dozens of small chemical plants were built by making do with whatever was available and using local materials. Many factories started with extremely simple production equipment such as iron shovels, pickaxes, ceramic vats, and ceramic pipes, producing only some simple products. The Qarhan Potash Fertilizer Plant started as a production team with a few tents and dozens of people. Now, the annual output of this factory has increased from a few tons or dozens of tons to 80,000 to 90,000 tons. In addition to supplying Qinghai Province, the potash fertilizer produced is also supplied to Fujian, Guizhou, and other places. When the Dachaidan Comprehensive Chemical Plant was first built, it had no equipment and no workers. It was started by several high school students who used teacups, wine bottles, and washbasins for experiments in their spare time. Now, they have used indigenous methods to produce sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and other products in batches to meet the needs of industry and basic construction.

Because of the use of indigenous methods, less money was spent, the equipment was simple, and immediate results were achieved. This dispelled some people's mysterious views and sense of inferiority towards running the chemical industry, and a mass upsurge in running the chemical industry quickly formed on the Qinghai Plateau. Of the province's existing 101 chemical industrial factories, more than 60 are run by counties and communes. Now, Qinghai Province, in the spirit of continuous revolution, is doing everything possible to gradually improve these indigenous factories. The Party organizations of various factories have widely mobilized workers to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, fully tap potential, and actively trial-produce various indigenous machines and equipment, so that factories started with indigenous methods can gradually become factories combining indigenous and foreign methods. Factories that used to be completely manual operations have now begun to add some electric machinery and semi-mechanized equipment. Some factory workers have also assembled some indigenous machines into sets, and some have changed human or animal power to water or electric power, increasing production efficiency by several times to dozens of times. The workers of the Qarhan Potash Fertilizer Plant in Qinghai Province have self-made 12 decomposers and 8 crushers, which have begun to replace manual operation. The newly added electric water pumps, centrifuges, high-level water tanks, light rails, power generation equipment, etc., have enabled this factory, which started with indigenous methods, to begin transitioning to foreign methods. Since the second half of 1959, many semi-indigenous and semi-foreign chemical plants have established workshops using foreign methods. The Qinghai People's Chemical Plant is building a caustic soda workshop with an annual output of 1,000 tons and a 666 powder and bleaching powder workshop with an annual output of 1,000 tons. The Qinghai Fertilizer Plant has also newly built workshops using foreign methods to produce anhydrous sodium sulfate, soda ash, and synthetic ammonia. The three chemical industrial factories using foreign methods that are planned to be built in Xining, Dachaidan, Delingha, and other places this year are also under active construction.

Because Qinghai Province has adopted the principle of “walking on two legs,” not only has the chemical industry developed rapidly, meeting the needs of production in a timely manner, but also a contingent of chemical industry workers has been cultivated from scratch. Now, there are more than 11,300 chemical industry workers in the province. Minority herdsmen who used to only herd sheep and cattle have now become skilled workers who can master the technology of producing several chemical industrial products; many peasants who used to only grow crops can now carry out the batching of some chemical industrial products. These have created good conditions for the further development of Qinghai's chemical industry.

    土洋并举省县公社一起建厂　不断革命抓紧提高技术水平
    青海省化学工业发展迅速
    本报西宁8日电　青海省采取土洋并举“两条腿走路”的方针大办化学工业。目前，全省已建起钾肥、硫酸、纯碱、无水芒硝、工业氯化钾等化学工业厂矿一百零一个，化学工业产品由1949年的一种增加到五十二种。这些产品除有力地支援了青海省工、农、牧业和基本建设的持续跃进以外，还有一部分支援外地和出口。
    青海省的化学工业资源特别丰富。根据现有地质资料，原盐、钾盐、镁盐、滷水、硫铁矿、天然气、天然碱等矿产，几乎全省到处可见，而且储量大，品位高，有不少在全国范围都占有重要地位。但是，刚解放时仅有一个年产七吨硫酸的小厂。许多轻重工业需要的化学工业产品都得从外省运来，成本高，运输也不方便。特别是1958年以来，各项建设飞跃发展，需要化学工业产品的数量和品种越来越多。针对上述情况，中共青海省委决定积极发展化学工业，要求有原料的地方都积极兴建小型简易的化工厂，有条件的地区办一些半土半洋和洋法生产的工厂。全省积极行动起来。在1958年便因陋就简，就地取材，办起了几十个小化工厂。许多工厂开始时都是用铁锨、十字镐、陶瓷缸、陶瓷管等极其简单的生产设备，只生产一些简单的产品。察尔汗钾肥厂开始只是一个有几顶帐篷和几十个人的生产组。现在，这个厂子的年产量已经由几吨几十吨提高到八、九万吨。生产的钾肥除供应本省以外，还供应了福建，贵州等地。大柴旦综合化工厂开始建厂时，一无设备，二无工人，只是由几个高初中学生在业余时间用茶杯、酒瓶、洗脸盆作实验搞起来的。现在他们已用土法成批生产硫酸、盐酸等多种产品，供应工业和基本建设的需要。
    由于采取土法上马的办法，花钱少，设备简单，收到了立竿见影的效果，这便破除了一些人对办化学工业的神秘观点和自卑感，一个群众性的大办化学工业的热潮很快在青海高原形成。全省现有的一百零一个化学工业工厂中，县和公社办的就有六十多个。现在青海省正本着不断革命的精神，千方百计地对这些土厂子逐步进行改进提高。各个工厂的党组织，广泛发动职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，充分挖掘潜力，积极试制各种土机器土设备，使土法上马的厂子逐步变成土洋结合的厂子。过去完全是手工操作的厂子，现在已开始增加了一些电动的机械和半机械化的设备。有些工厂的职工把一些土机械还装配成套，有的把人力畜力带动的改为水力或电力带动，使生产工效提高数倍至数十倍。青海省察尔汗钾肥厂职工就自制了十二台分解机、八台粉碎机，开始代替人工操作。新增的电力水泵、离心机、高位水槽、轻便铁轨、发电设备等，使这个土法上马的工厂开始向洋法过渡。还有许多半土半洋的化工厂自1959年下半年以来建立了洋法生产的车间。青海人民化工厂正在兴建年产一千吨的烧碱车间、一千吨的六六六粉和漂白粉车间。青海肥料厂还新建了无水芒硝、纯碱、合成氨等洋法生产的车间。今年计划在西宁、大柴旦、德令哈等地建立的三座洋法生产的化学工业工厂也正在积极施工。
    青海省由于采取两条腿走路的方针，不仅化学工业迅速发展，及时满足了生产的需要，而且从无到有地培养出了一支化学工业的职工队伍。现在，全省已有化学工业职工一万一千三百多人。过去只会拦羊放牛的少数民族牧民，现在成了能掌握生产几种化学工业产品的技术工人；许多过去只会种地的农民，现在已能进行一些化学工业产品的配料工作。这些都为青海化学工业的进一步发展创造了良好条件。
