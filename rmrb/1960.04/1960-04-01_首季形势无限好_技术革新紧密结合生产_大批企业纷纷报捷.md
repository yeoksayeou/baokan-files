    Dalian Steel Plant

    Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian dispatch: Dalian Steel Plant comprehensively overfulfilled the first quarter's steel and steel material production plans ten and five days ahead of schedule, respectively. The average daily steel output increased by 2.6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and steel material increased by 10.5%; the product qualification rate exceeded the planned target; the product cost decreased by 1.1 million yuan compared to the fourth quarter of last year; the annual new product trial production task was also completed ahead of schedule.

    Longyan Iron and Steel Company

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th: Longyan Iron and Steel Company employees completed the first quarter's steel ingot production plan nine days ahead of schedule with an overfulfillment of 1.2%, realizing the guaranteed target proposed in response to the Shijiazhuang Steel Plant's initiative. By the 22nd, the average daily steel ingot output increased by 239.05% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, the average qualification rate reached over 96%, and the consumption of steelmaking raw materials also decreased.

    Fushun Coal Mine

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 29th: Fushun Mining Bureau completed the first quarter's coal production plan on March 26th ahead of schedule. Raw coal and refined coal respectively completed 111.3% and 102% of the quarterly plan, overproducing a large amount of high-quality coal for the country. The average consumption of pit props per thousand tons decreased by 1.385 cubic meters compared to last year, achieving high output, high quality, and low consumption.

    Since the beginning of this year, Fushun Mining Bureau has closely combined the major reform of labor organization with technical innovation, making them mutually conditional and mutually promoting, which powerfully guaranteed a successful start to the first quarter's production. At the beginning of this year, all coal mines under Fushun Mining Bureau universally implemented the "four (shift), eight (hour)" staggered operation system, realizing a major reform of labor organization, which increased the coal output time of the coal mining face by four hours compared to the past, and the coal output generally increased. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization carried out by the entire mining bureau made the "four-eight" staggered operation system more consolidated and improved. Therefore, after reforming the labor organization, various mines immediately matched the advanced experience and advanced technology emerging from the technical innovation movement into complete sets and rapidly promoted them, making the various links above and below the well more closely connected. In March, after the advanced experience was matched by various coal mining teams, about one-sixth of the coal mining teams' team production capacity reached over 10,000 tons, and the average daily output level increased by about 30% compared to February.

    Zibo Mining Bureau

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan dispatch: Zibo Mining Bureau employees have completed the first quarter's production plan seven days ahead of schedule. Raw coal output increased by 12.9% compared to the same period last year, and the progress of the main roadway increased by 2.3% compared to the plan. The completion of other indicators was also very good. The ash content of raw coal decreased by 11.8% compared to the plan, the sulfur content decreased by 11%, the consumption of pit props per thousand tons decreased by 12.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and the cost also decreased significantly compared to the fourth quarter.

    Pingxiang Coal Mine

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th: Pingxiang Coal Mine employees vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and the raw coal output increased month by month. As of March 29th, the entire mining bureau had already overfulfilled the first quarter's raw coal production plan ahead of schedule. Raw coal output increased sharply by about 50% compared to the same period last year, timely supporting the needs of steel enterprises in East China and various parts of the province.

    Coal mining workers at Pingxiang Coal Mine vigorously promoted coal loading machines by launching a technical revolution centered on the mechanization and semi-mechanization of coal loading; transportation and loading workers vigorously attacked the mechanization of loading and unloading and the vehicle-based transportation. Up to now, underground transportation has basically achieved vehicle-based transportation; mechanized operation of ground transportation loading and unloading accounts for 73% of the external transport volume, and semi-mechanized operation accounts for 24.8%. The entire mining bureau is now vigorously promoting the combined coal digging and material transportation machine and the 60 electric drill, and the degree of mechanization is further improved.

    Heilongjiang Forestry Enterprises

    This newspaper reports: Forestry enterprises in Heilongjiang Province, closely combined with production, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. Since mid-March, the province's production level has risen from an average daily output of more than 37,000 cubic meters of timber in early March to more than 43,000 cubic meters. Furthermore, twenty-one forestry enterprises, including Heihe, Hejiang areas and the Muleng, Dailing, Cuiling, Taoshan Forestry Bureaus and Xiangfang Lumber Mill, have completed the first quarter's production tasks fifteen days ahead of schedule. The province's timber production has completed the first quarter's production tasks eleven days ahead of schedule.

    At present, forestry enterprises throughout the province have re-revised and supplemented technical innovation and technical revolution plans according to the new situation. The plans of many units are revised and implemented at each level, with both long-term plans and phased requirements. The vast majority of units have achieved plans at each level, and measures for everyone and every item. All one hundred and sixteen forest farms (workshops) and one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight work groups in the Songhua River area have formulated and implemented plans. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of forestry enterprises in Heilongjiang Province is striding forward along a scientific and mass-based track.

    Greater Khingan Range Forest Area

    Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi dispatch: Employees in the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area of Inner Mongolia vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, completing the first quarter's timber production plan six days ahead of schedule on March 25th with an overfulfillment of 0.23%.

    This forest area basically did not increase equipment in the first quarter of this year. However, the output increased by 21.9% compared to the same period last year. This is mainly because the employees actively responded to the call of the forest area party committee and launched a climax of comprehensively technically transforming various work processes centered on "five-izations." This greatly improved production efficiency. These "five-izations" are: mechanization and semi-mechanization of logging; ice ditching and ice roading for winter timber collection; railization for summer timber collection; mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, unloading, and stacking; trainization of timber transportation. Due to the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, in the logging process, many people have used the "May 1st" type new curved handle saw to replace hand saws for felling trees, which is both labor-saving and increases efficiency by about 30%. In terms of timber collection, the forest area employees used the convenient conditions of ice and snow and mountain slopes to build more than 1,500 ice ditches and snow roads with a total length of 500 kilometers, using ice ditches and snow roads to slide and collect timber; various forestry bureaus also promoted new railization tools such as wooden rail flat cars, wooden rail hand-push cars, and automatic sleds for timber collection, which reduced costs and increased work efficiency by about 50%.

    Jilin Chemical Industrial Company

    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 30th: Jilin Chemical Industrial Company completed the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule. As of the 28th, the total output value completed 103.7% of the plan, an increase of 88.9% compared to the same period last year; various major products also overfulfilled the plan.

    In the first quarter, the company's technical innovation and technical revolution movement also achieved fruitful results, which played a great role in promoting production development. During the entire quarter, employees put forward more than 43,000 innovation proposals and implemented more than 8,900. The entire company had eight automated sections, twelve continuous chemical sections, forty-nine continuous production lines, nine automatic lines, and twenty-three automatic pumping stations. In the technical innovation movement, the company and its affiliated factories took many measures to combine this movement with the current production tasks. The key issues that urgently need to be reformed in production were simultaneously assigned to workshops, sections, and groups along with the production plan to ensure their realization.

    Karamay Oilfield

    Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 31st: Under the leadership of the mining area party committee, Karamay Oilfield employees vigorously promoted mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, promoting sustained production leap forward. As of March 27th, the entire mining area had completed the first quarter's crude oil production plan four days ahead of schedule with an overfulfillment of 0.4%, and the refining plan was overfulfilled by 1%. Crude oil production increased by 189.5% compared to the same period last year, and increased by 9.9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, which was the best in terms of production completion, laying a good foundation for completing the annual crude oil production task.

    Lanzhou Chemical Plant

    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou dispatch: Lanzhou Chemical Plant has overfulfilled the first quarter's production plan. According to statistics as of March 23rd, the total output value has completed 107.8% of the quarterly plan; the production plans for major products such as synthetic ammonia, ammonium nitrate, and methanol were overfulfilled eight to twenty-six days ahead of schedule.
