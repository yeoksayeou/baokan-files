    State-Owned Farms Should Become Pioneers in Agricultural Technology Transformation
    Speech by Committee Member Tao Jinchu
    The issue of agricultural technology transformation is an extremely important one in the current socialist revolution in our country's rural areas, which is also the socialist construction undertaking. State-owned farms across the country should become pioneers in agricultural technology transformation, vigorously supporting and promoting the acceleration of agricultural technology transformation in people's communes in various regions. I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the Draft 1960 National Budget," and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's "Striving to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule," and I agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC." Now, I will only make the following speech on the issue of agricultural technology transformation: The issue of agricultural technology transformation is an extremely important one in the current socialist revolution in our country's rural areas, which is also the socialist construction undertaking, and its core is the issue of agricultural mechanization. Chairman Mao once pointed out that "the fundamental solution for agriculture lies in mechanization" and proposed a grand plan for the nationwide realization of agricultural mechanization, starting from 1959, to "solve it on a small scale within four years, solve it on a medium scale within seven years, and solve it on a large scale within ten years." If this problem is solved quickly, not only will the socialist position in the countryside be more consolidated, the rural landscape will be completely changed, and the lives of farmers will inevitably improve significantly, but the gap between urban and rural areas will gradually disappear; at the same time, it will also promote the even more rapid development of light and heavy industries and all other undertakings. This is the urgent demand of farmers across the country and the main goal of the current struggle for the entire party and the entire people.
    At present, there are many state-owned farms distributed throughout the country. They are owned by the whole people and have a relatively high commodity rate. Although the degree of mechanization of each farm varies, most are equipped with some agricultural machinery and have a certain material foundation and technical conditions. Therefore, prioritizing the equipment of state-owned farms in various regions and giving full play to their advantages is extremely important for supporting and promoting the acceleration of agricultural technology transformation in people's communes in various regions.
    Since 1950, the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has responded to Chairman Mao's call to participate in the economic construction, mainly agriculture, on the frontier of the motherland. In the past ten years, it has reclaimed more than 10 million mu of wasteland north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, including more than 8 million mu of net cultivated land, and established 130 state-owned farms and 19 state-owned ranches. These farms (ranches) are all under the unified leadership of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and are engaged in the combined management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, which is basically consistent with the organizational form and management policy of the people's communes. Since 1951, we have introduced a number of tractors to try out cultivation, and then increased and expanded them year by year. As of now, we have a total of 50,000 to 60,000 pieces of various types of tractors, combine harvesters, agricultural tools, and trucks, with more than 10,000 machine operators. Twenty-four operations can be performed by machine, including the comprehensive mechanization of land reclamation. Advanced cultivation methods such as joint operations and compound operations, square nest planting, and longitudinal and transverse inter-tillage have been widely promoted. In addition, thirteen large and small repair factories have been established, and many machines, tools, and accessories have been modified and manufactured. As long as raw materials can be solved, most of the tools and accessories can be made by ourselves. In 1959, the annual workload of each standard tractor reached 12,000 standard mu, and the interval between major repairs was extended to more than 5,000 hours. The locomotive of Hou Zhengyuan Motz's team, the national red flag pacesetter, has exceeded 15,200 hours without major or minor repairs. However, at present, many machines and tools are not fully equipped, and many operations still require animal power and manual labor, so the increase in labor productivity is not very large.
    The process of production in the Corps over the past ten years has been a process of continuous revolution, a process of continuous overcoming of shortcomings and difficulties, and a process of continuous criticism of erroneous ideas and opposition to right-leaning conservatism. It has gone from "chopping head" production to mechanized farming, from "interspersed" planting to contiguous land, from simple self-sufficiency production to large-scale commodity production; it can also be said that it has gone from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, from guerrilla warfare to regularization. All officers and soldiers have not only transformed their thinking, improved their awareness, and exercised their bodies through productive labor, but also gained a lot of experience and learned a lot of knowledge from productive practice. This is due to the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, I would like to put forward some suggestions based on our experience on the issue of agricultural mechanization for reference.
    1.  The issue of land planning and consolidation. Land planning and consolidation are prerequisites for the implementation of mechanized farming, including land use planning, field leveling, construction of irrigation and drainage canal systems and road networks, rotation zoning and shelterbelt construction, and the configuration of residential areas and livestock farms. The above issues, in essence, involve the issues of gardenization and water conservancy. Based on the soil survey and identification, and according to the specific conditions of each region, reasonable plans should be made and refined, to facilitate mechanized farming and fully utilize the land. If good conditions are not created on the land for mechanized operations, it will inevitably lead to serious damage to machinery, frequent failures, low efficiency, and high costs, and may even be less advantageous than animal-powered farming and manual labor, giving right-leaning conservatives an excuse. State-owned farms in various regions should set an example in land planning and consolidation.
    2.  The issue of machine and tool models and equipment quotas. The size of the machine and tool models and the equipment quotas vary according to the natural conditions, crop types, and operation items in different regions. For example, large machines and tools can be used in flat and open areas; while special machines and tools need to be made for mountainous areas and paddy fields; large machines and tools can be used for densely planted crops such as wheat, pasture, and green manure; while medium and small machines and tools should be used for other crops that need inter-tillage; large machines and tools must be used for heavy-duty operations such as deep plowing and ditching; while medium and small machines and tools can be used for other general operations. In short, large, medium, and small sizes must be matched, and only one model cannot be used. In terms of equipment quotas, fewer can be allocated in areas where machines and tools are convenient to use and crops with relatively simple operations; more must be allocated in areas where machines and tools are more difficult to use and crops with more arduous operations. According to the experience of various farms in the Corps: farms mainly based on cotton (the proportion of cotton is 30% to 35%) are equipped with six standard units per 10,000 mu of land; farms mainly based on grain are equipped with five standard units, and are equipped with sufficient operating machines and tools, and adopt double-shift operations, which can basically realize mechanization.
    3.  The issue of machine and tool matching. Agricultural machines and tools can be roughly divided into the following five categories: (1) Power (tractors, generators); (2) Operating machines and tools; (3) Transport machines and tools; (4) Repair and maintenance equipment; (5) Oil storage equipment. These five categories of machines and tools constitute a complete set and cannot be missing. When equipping tractors, it is necessary to equip plows, harrows, sowing machines, compactors, inter-tillers, ditching machines, ridge builders, topdressing machines, sprayers, drainage and irrigation equipment, harvesters, and transport equipment at the same time. At the same time, it is necessary to establish oil depots and equip oil tanks and oil drums; it is necessary to build maintenance rooms and repair factories, and equip maintenance and repair equipment. According to the distribution of machines and tools, each mechanized production team should have a maintenance room; each farm should have a small repair factory; and a large repair factory should be built in each farm group area of 800,000 to 1 million mu. Undertake the major repairs of all machines and tools in the area and the manufacture of some parts and machines, implement component exchange, annual rotation repair, old parts repair, and waste oil regeneration systems to ensure that the machines and tools can operate normally. In addition, necessary machine and tool equipment must also be provided in animal husbandry, forestry, processing industry, and fishery, to form a large cooperative production of mutual coordination, mutual support, and mutual adjustment. If the machines and tools are not fully equipped, or there are tractors but lack operating machines, or there are tractors and operating machines but lack maintenance and repair equipment and oil storage equipment, it will be difficult to give full play to the superior role of the machines and tools. Even in terms of operation items, if only some can be mechanized, while others still require animal power and manual operation; or if field operations can be mechanized, but non-field operations cannot be mechanized, the labor arrangement cannot be balanced, and the improvement of labor productivity will also be greatly limited.
    4.  The issue of training machine and tool technical teams. The most important issue is to train a large number of machine and tool technical teams. It is impossible to realize mechanization if there are machines but no people who can master them. The issue itself is a concrete issue of mobilizing the masses, a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. The more people in a farm or a people's commune who understand and master machines, the easier it will be to realize mechanization. State-owned farms should continuously train machine and tool technical teams, so that everyone engaged in agricultural production understands machine operation and can master machine operation, and gradually eliminate the difference between machine workers and agricultural workers. At the same time, it is necessary to train a large number of technical teams for people's communes, and send their own technical personnel to help them solve some technical difficulties. This is a glorious task of state-owned farms.
    Training machine and tool personnel must also implement walking on two legs and blooming everywhere. Regular training and short-term training should be carried out simultaneously. In addition to state-owned farms in various regions undertaking this task, provinces, cities, special zones, counties, and people's communes should universally establish machine and tool training classes or mechanization schools. From popularization to improvement, from simple to complex, it is necessary to launch a vigorous high tide of learning technology nationwide and continuously expand the technical team. In this high tide of learning, countless innovation experts will inevitably emerge, and new inventions and creations will continue to emerge, pushing our agricultural technology transformation to a higher stage quickly.
    Now the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are calling on all departments across the country to vigorously serve agriculture. A technical innovation and technical revolution movement is vigorously unfolding in all walks of life across the country to advance towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Under the priority equipment of the Central Government, state-owned farms across the country should become pioneers in agricultural technology transformation, vigorously supporting and promoting the acceleration of agricultural technology transformation in people's communes in various regions. In the nationwide people's enthusiastic labor competition movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward, we believe that we will definitely be able to realize the grand plan of agricultural four modernizations proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao ahead of schedule.

    国营农场应成为农业技术改造的先锋
    陶晋初委员的发言
    农业技术改造问题，是当前我国农村社会主义革命，也就是社会主义建设事业中一个极为重要的问题。全国各地国营农场应成为农业技术改造的先锋，大力支援和推动各地人民公社加速农业技术改造。我完全拥护国务院李富春副总理“关于 1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告，并同意政协全国委员会陈叔通副主席所作的“政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”。现在仅就农业技术改造问题，作如下发言：农业技术改造问题，是当前我国农村社会主义革命，也就是社会主义建设事业中一个极为重要的问题，它的中心是农业机械化问题。毛主席曾经指出“农业的根本出路在于机械化”并就全国实现农业机机化问题，提出了从1959年起“四年以内小解决、七年以内中解决、十年以内大解决”的宏伟规划。这个问题，如果迅速得到解决，不但使农村社会主义阵地更加巩固，农村面貌完全改观，农民生活必然显著提高，城乡差别将会逐渐消灭；同时又将促进轻重工业及其他一切事业更加飞跃发展。这是全国农民的迫切要求，是全党全民当前主要的奋斗目标。
    现在全国各地区都分布有不少国营农场，它是属于全民所有制的，商品率比较高的。虽然各个农场的机械化程度有所不同，但大都或多或少装备了一些农业机具，具备了一定的物质基础和技术条件。因此，优先装备各地国营农场，充分发挥其优越性，对支援和推动各地人民公社加速农业技术改造，具有极其重要的作用。
    新疆军区生产建设兵团，自1950年响应毛主席的号召，参加祖国边疆以农业为主的经济建设，十年以来，在天山南北，已开垦荒地一千余万亩，其中净耕地面积八百余万亩，建立了一百三十个国营农场和十九个国营牧场。这些农（牧）场都是工农商学兵统一领导，农林牧副渔结合经营，基本上与人民公社的组织形式和经营方针一致的。从1951年起，我们就引进了一部分拖拉机试行耕种，以后逐年增加，逐年扩大，截至目前为止，共拥有各型拖拉机，各型康拜因收获机，各种农具和载重汽车等五六万件，机务人员万余名。各项作业能够用机器操作的达二十四项，其中开荒已经可以全面机械化，而且广泛地推行了联接作业和复式作业，方形窝播，纵横中耕等先进耕作法。此外并建立了大小修理厂十三座，改装和制作了不少机具和配件，只要原材料能够解决，大部分农具和配件都可以自制。1959年每一个标准台拖拉机年工作量达到一万二千个标准亩，大修理间距延长达五千小时以上，全国红旗标兵侯正元莫特兹组机车，则已超过一万五千二百多小时无大小修。不过目前还有许多机具没有成套配备，许多作业还要用畜力和手工操作，因而劳动生产率的提高还不很大。
    十年来兵团生产的过程，是不断革命的过程，是不断克服缺点、困难，不断批判错误思想，反对右倾保守的过程。是由砍头曼生产，走到机耕作业，由插花种地，走到土地连片，由单纯自给生产，走到大量商品生产；也可以说是由小到大，由土到洋，由游击战走向正规化。全体官兵，不仅从生产劳动中改造了思想，提高了觉悟，锻炼了体魄，也从生产实践中取得了不少经验，学习了不少知识。这是由于党的正确领导，是由于毛泽东思想的光辉照耀。现在专就农业机械化问题上根据我们的经验，提出几点意见，以供参考。
      一、土地规划整理问题。土地的规划整理，是实行机耕作业的先决条件，其中包括土地利用规划，田块平整，灌排渠系和道路网的修建，轮作区划和防护林带的营造，居民点和畜牧场的配置等等。以上这些问题，实质上，已涉及到园田化、水利化问题，应在土壤普查鉴定的基础上根据各地特殊情况，因地制宜地作出合理的规划，进行精细的整理，以便利机械耕作，同时使土地得到充分利用。如果不在土地上为机械作业创造良好条件，势必造成机具损坏严重，故障丛生，功效甚低，成本甚高，甚至反而不如畜力耕作和手工劳动为有利，使右倾保守分子有所借口。各地国营农场，应在土地规划整理方面，做出榜样。
    二、机具型号和配备定额问题。机具型号大小和配备定额，随各地自然条件，作物种类，作业项目而各有不同。例如平坦开阔地区，可采用大型机具；而山地与水田，则需制作特殊机具；麦与牧草绿肥等密植作物，可以使用大型机具；而其他须要中耕的作物，则宜使用中小型机具；深耕、挖渠等重负荷作业，须使用大型机具；而其他一般作业，则可使用中小型机具。总之，须大中小型搭配，不能只使用一种型号。在配备定额上，如在机具使用便利的地区，和作业比较简单的作物，可以少配；机具使用比较困难和作业比较繁重的作物，则须多配。根据兵团各农场的经验：以棉花为主的农场（棉花的比重为30％至35％），每万亩地配备六个标准台；以谷物为主的农场，配备五个标准台，并配备有足够的作业机具，采用双班作业，可以基本上实现机械化。
    三、机具配套问题。农业机具，大体可分为以下五类：（一）动力（拖拉机，发电机）；（二）作业机具；（三）运输机具；（四）修理保养设备；（五）储油设备。这五类机具，构成为一整套，不能或缺。在配备拖拉机时，要同时配齐犁，耙，播，镇压，中耕，开沟，打埂，追肥，喷药，排灌，收获，运输等各机具。同时要建立油库，配备油罐油桶；要修建保养间和修理厂，配备保养和修理设备。根据机具分布情况，每一机耕生产队，要有一个保养间；每个农场要有一个小修理厂；每八十至一百万亩的农场群地区要修建一个大修理厂。担任地区内一切机具的大修及部分配件与机具的制作，实行部件互换，常年轮修，旧件修复，废油回生等制度，保证机具能正常作业。此外在畜牧业、林业、加工业、渔业等，亦须予以必要的机具装备，构成互相配合，互相支援，互相调剂的生产大协作。如果机具配备不齐，或有了拖拉机而缺少作业机，或有拖拉机、作业机而缺少保养修理设备和储油设备，就很难发挥机具优越作用。即就作业项目来说，如果仅有一部分可用机械作业，而另一部分仍须畜力和手工作业；或者田间作业可以机械化，而非田间作业不能机械化，则劳力安排不能平衡，劳动生产率的提高，也要受到很大限制。
    四、培训机务技术队伍问题。最重要的问题是大量培训机务技术队伍。有了机器没有能掌握机器的人，是不可能实现机械化的。这个问题的本身，就是发动群众的具体问题，就是一个展开技术革新技术革命的群众运动问题。一个农场或一个人民公社，如果懂得和掌握机器的人越多，对实现机械化就越为容易。国营农场应该不断培训机务技术队伍，使每一个从事农业生产的人员都懂得机务，都可以掌握机器作业，逐渐消灭机工与农工之间的差别。同时要为人民公社大量培训技术队伍，并派出自己的技术人员，帮助他们解决技术上一些困难问题，这是国营农场一项光荣任务。
    培训机务人员，也必需实行两条腿走路，遍地开花。正规训练与短期培训同时并举。除各地国营农场应负起这项任务外，各省市，各专区，各县，各人民公社，都应普遍的设立机务训练班或机械化学校。由普及到提高，由简易到复杂，要在全国范围内，展开一个轰轰烈烈地学习技术的高潮，不断地扩大技术队伍。在这学习高潮中，必然会要涌现出无数革新能手，不断有新的发明创造，把我们的农业技术改造，很快的推向一个更高的阶段。
    现在党中央和毛主席正在号召全国各部门大力为支援农业服务。全国各行各业中正在蓬蓬勃勃地展开向机械化，半机械化，自动化，半自动化进军的技术革新，技术革命运动。全国各地国营农场在中央的优先装备下，应成为农业技术改造的先锋，大力支援和推动各地人民公社加速农业技术改造。在全国人民热火朝天地，学先进，赶先进，超先进，帮后进的劳动竞赛运动中，我们相信，一定能够提前实现党中央和毛主席所提出的农业四化的宏伟规划。（附图片）
