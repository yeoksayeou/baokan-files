Strive for a Greater Harvest of Summer Crops and Realize a Greater Leap Forward in Agriculture This Year

	Thoroughly Conquer Spring Drought and Make Every Effort to Prevent Summer Drought

	Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Guizhou Continue to Carry Out Mass Anti-Drought Movements

	Dig Wells and Find Springs to Open Up Water Sources, Divert Water to Irrigate Wheat and Seize Moisture for Sowing, Progress is Fast and Quality is Good

	Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd: Shandong Province's drought-resistant sowing movement is progressing rapidly and the quality is good. According to statistics up to the 17th, the province has sown a total of 17,450,000 mu of various crops, more than double the same period last year. The sowing period is generally 7 to 8 days earlier than in previous years.

	This year's drought in Shandong is very severe. Thanks to the mobilization of the entire party and the participation of all the people, great achievements have been made in drought resistance, wheat protection, and sowing. In Pingyin County, located in a mountainous area, more than 77,000 people formed "water collection" shock brigades, divided into six fronts for well digging, mountain spring excavation, water diversion up the mountains, renovation of old wells, repair of canals, and river interception, led by the secretaries of the county, commune, and team-level party organizations, fiercely attacking the mountains, vigorously digging water sources, and expanding the irrigation area by more than 200,000 mu. The Party Secretary of Yedian Commune in Mengyin County led the masses to thoroughly investigate 110 mountain streams and, after more than 20 days of hard work, built a long canal that bypassed 355 mountain peaks, crossed 35 major ridges, and spanned 13 major gullies, finally diverting water to the mountains, ensuring irrigation for wheat and spring sowing.

	Party committees at all levels conducted in-depth and meticulous leadership, ensuring that drought-resistant sowing was both fast and good. Party secretaries of Feicheng, Pingyuan, and Dezhou counties and cities personally took charge of trial planting and provided specific technical guidance. Pingyuan County also stipulated that county cadres would be responsible for production teams, commune cadres for 10,000-mu high-yield plots, brigade cadres for 1,000-mu high-yield plots, and team cadres for 100-mu high-yield plots, ensuring that every area had a leader. In order to ensure the quality of sowing, many areas in the province launched a movement of four checks (checking area, progress, soil moisture, and specifications and quality), three sides (checking, accepting, and making up lessons simultaneously), and two exceedings (exceeding plans and exceeding specification requirements).

	A province-wide movement of all sectors of society supporting drought-resistant spring sowing has been launched. According to statistics up to the end of March alone, more than 120,000 technicians and workers went to the countryside and communes, helping communes and teams repair tools and equip various power machinery with more than 3.5 million pieces, supporting communes and teams with 970 tons of chemical fertilizers and water fertilizers, more than 54,000 pieces of accessories and bearings, and more than 800 sets of various power equipment and farming machinery.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd: The broad masses of commune members in Hebei Province have launched a major anti-drought spring sowing campaign centered on fiercely attacking water conservancy "dead corners" and ensuring good sowing of "dry land." According to statistics up to the 17th, the province has sown more than 25,800,000 mu of various crops such as grain and cotton, and the cotton field sowing plan has been completed by more than 70%.

	In order to ensure the comprehensive and timely completion of the spring sowing plan in the province, party committees at all levels mobilized superior forces, focused on weak links, and launched shock attacks to break through water conservancy "dead corners" and seize the time for drought-resistant sowing. In the Tianjin area, the secretaries of eight counties, including Jiahe, Wuqiao, and Jinghai, took command and established more than 280 fixed-point soil moisture monitoring stations, directing the seizure of soil moisture for sowing based on soil moisture and temperature. For land that had lost moisture, measures were taken to supply water for urgent sowing.

	In the struggle to fiercely attack water conservancy "dead corners," all localities combined sowing with a shock repair of farmland water conservancy. After the Xian County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that 38,000 mu of remote and high-lying land in the county could not be guaranteed sowing due to severe drought, it immediately organized 64,000 people to dig more than 1,300 wells and open 61 canals, solving the problem of watering and urgent sowing in these water conservancy "dead corners." The Ding County Party Committee, in order to solve the problem of drought-stricken sowing and watering in the Ling Shan, Quyang, and other four communes in the western mountainous area, assigned levels and divisions to contract the management of mountain peaks and worked hard for 20 days, expanding the irrigated land by more than 100,000 mu. With water available, the daily sowing progress was more than four times faster than before.

	In the struggle to resist drought and protect sowing, people's communes in various places fully utilized the superiority of "large scale and public ownership," with upstream helping downstream, advanced helping backward, and great cooperation between industry, agriculture, and commerce, helping each other and making concessions, greatly accelerating the speed of sowing.

	Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd: Shanxi Province has set off a high tide of drought-resistant spring sowing. At present, more than 70% of the labor force in rural areas throughout the province are doing everything possible to fight drought and seize moisture to rush sowing. According to recent statistics, the province has planted 12,220,000 mu of various spring-sown crops, with a speed and quality exceeding any previous year.

	The tremendous achievements in water conservancy construction in Shanxi Province from last winter to this spring have provided good conditions for drought-resistant spring sowing. However, the drought continues to develop. In order to expand the spring irrigation area as much as possible and ensure the smooth progress of spring sowing, more than one million laborers in the province are still rushing to build currently beneficial water conservancy projects and carry out spring irrigation. A medium-sized reservoir in the suburbs of Datong City, which was originally planned to be completed in early summer, was completed 30 days ahead of schedule after rush repairs, irrigating more than 7,000 mu of land in the spring. Xin Ding County vigorously promoted the communist spirit of cooperation. Eight communes made unified arrangements and dug five main canals with a total length of 120 kilometers, connecting the water from the county's four rivers, increasing the utilization rate of water from about 40% in the past to 70%, and newly increasing the irrigation area by 320,000 mu in the last half month.

	While rushing to repair water conservancy, all localities started early and seized moisture for sowing. People's communes in southern and southeastern Shanxi Province started spring sowing this year from the vernal equinox, generally one solar term earlier than in previous years. Yangcheng County, which started earlier, had sown 259,000 mu of crops such as millet, cotton, hemp, and vegetables by the middle of this month, accounting for 81% of the total spring sowing plan. Puxian, Ruicheng, and other counties, based on past experience in drought resistance, conducted crop and soil moisture sorting during sowing, adopting the method of sowing millet, oil crops, and summer miscellaneous grains first, then sowing beans, corn, sorghum, and potatoes, sowing sunny slopes first, then sowing shady slopes, sowing highlands first, then sowing low-lying areas, sowing dry land first, then sowing paddy fields, and sowing sandy soil first, then sowing clay soil, which greatly accelerated the sowing progress.

	Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 23rd: Gansu Province currently has a labor army of more than 1.4 million people, who are doing everything possible to tap water sources and actively resist drought and seize moisture for sowing. As of April 20, the province had sown 23 million mu of summer and autumn crops such as spring wheat, highland barley, and peas, 40% faster than in the same period last year. According to the inspection, among the sown crops, first-class fields accounted for 90%, second-class fields accounted for 8%, and third-class fields accounted for only 2%.

	This year, Gansu Province has been able to carry out sowing work so much and so well in the context of prolonged drought and little rain, mainly because it has carried out a large-scale water conservancy construction movement since last winter. At the same time, various localities have actively developed and utilized groundwater. From last winter to now, the province has dug a total of 269,000 wells and excavated more than 260,000 springs, which can expand the irrigation area by 1,680,000 mu. Baiyin City, the province's most severely drought-stricken city, has expanded the irrigated area by 180,000 mu by developing groundwater alone since last October, more than 10,000 mu more than the total development of irrigated land in the ten years since liberation. In Dongzhiyuan, Qingyang County, 170,000 tube wells have also been dug in the work of developing and utilizing groundwater, enabling the Loess Plateau, which originally had no irrigated land, to develop 450,000 mu of irrigated land. The large-scale development and utilization of groundwater in various places has enabled many areas that were originally considered to have no conditions for water conservancy construction to build a large number of water conservancy projects, thereby making the province's spring irrigation area unprecedentedly expanded and the speed accelerated. As of April 15, the province had irrigated 6,820,000 mu in the spring, ensuring timely spring ploughing and sowing in the context of severe drought.

	Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd: Shaanxi Province is carrying out a drought-resistant and moisture-seizing sowing movement. As of now, the province has sown more than 8,500,000 mu of various autumn-ripe crops (excluding spring wheat, summer miscellaneous grains, and potatoes). The daily progress of spring sowing has increased from 38,000 mu in early April to more than 50,000 mu.

	Shaanxi Province has had four rain and snowfalls from mid-February to now, which has provided favorable conditions for timely spring sowing. However, the rainfall each time was not large enough, and it was not balanced. The drought in the province has not been eliminated. In order to complete the spring sowing task in a timely manner, various localities have launched a large-scale drought-resistant and moisture-seizing sowing movement since April. In the movement, party organizations at all levels in the province have vigorously strengthened their leadership over drought-resistant sowing. Many counties and cities in northern Shaanxi, Guanzhong, and southern Shaanxi have moved their drought-resistant headquarters to the fields to work. Since mid-April, Ningqiang County in Hanzhong Prefecture has also transferred more than 100 cadres to help production brigades carry out drought-resistant and moisture-seizing sowing movement by dividing areas and contracting tasks.

	While seizing moisture for sowing, all localities have also carried out water storage and water conservation movements.

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 23rd: Guizhou Province has launched a drought-resistant movement centered on spring sowing and seedling protection. 80% of the drought-stricken farmland in various places has been irrigated, ensuring timely spring sowing. The province has raised 2,560,000 mu of rice seedlings and has transplanted more than 100,000 mu of rice.

	As soon as the drought appeared this spring, party committees at all levels promptly led the masses to launch a drought resistance struggle. More than 1.6 million people in the more severely drought-stricken areas of Bijie, Anshun, and Qiannan have been involved in the drought resistance movement. Cadres, students, and urban residents in various places also participated in drought resistance. Duyun City organized more than 10,000 cadres and students from organs to support suburban communes in tapping water sources and water-wheeling for drought resistance. In six days, they, together with more than 25,000 commune members, irrigated 70% to 85% of the drought-stricken crops and fields.

	People's communes in various places have carried out large-scale cooperation in drought resistance, adjusting water fields with good water sources as seedling fields according to the principle of equivalent exchange, ensuring timely sowing and seedling raising of rice. Commune-run farm tool factories and other factories in various places have rushed to make water-lifting tools to support drought resistance.

    争取夏季作物更大丰收　实现今年农业更大跃进
    彻底战胜春旱  全力防止夏旱
    山东、河北、山西、甘肃、陕西、贵州继续开展抗旱群众运动
    挖井找泉大辟水源，引水浇麦抢墒播种，进度快质量好
    据新华社济南23日电　山东省抗旱播种运动进度快，质量好。到17日统计，全省抗旱播种各种作物共一千七百四十五万亩，比去年同期多一倍多。播种期比往年普遍提早七、八天。
    今年山东旱情很重。由于全党动员，全民出征，抗旱保麦播种都取得了很大成绩。地处山区的平阴县，由七万七千多人组成“取水”突击队，划分打井、挖山泉、引水上山、修整旧井、整修渠道和拦河截流六条战线，由县、社、队三级党组织的书记挂帅，猛攻山岭，大挖水源，扩大了灌溉面积二十多万亩。蒙阴县野店公社党委书记领导群众遍查一百一十个山涧后，经过二十多天的奋战，建成一条长渠，这条渠绕过三百五十五座山头，翻越三十五道大岭，横跨十三条大沟，终于把水引上山，保证了浇麦和春播。
    各地党委进行深入细致的领导，保证了抗旱播种又快又好。肥城、平原、德州各县、市党委书记都亲自挂帅抓试种，进行具体技术指导。平原县还规定县干部包生产队，社干部包万亩丰产方，大队干部包千亩丰产方，小队干部包百亩丰产方，作到片片有将，方方有帅。为了确保播种质量，全省许多地区开展了四查（查面积、进度、墒情、规格质量）、三边（边查、边验收、边补课）、两超（超计划、超规格要求）运动。
    全省各地普遍掀起了各行各业支援抗旱春播运动。仅到3月底的统计，全省下乡下社的技术人员和工人达十二万多人，帮助社、队修理工具和装备各种动力机械三百五十多万件，支援社、队化肥、水肥九百七十吨，配件及轴承五万四千多件，各种动力设备、耕作机械八百多台。
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省广大人民公社社员，展开了一个以猛攻水利“死角”，确保“旱田”播好种为中心的抗旱春播大突击运动。到17日统计，全省已播种粮、棉等各种作物二千五百八十多万亩，棉田播种计划已完成70％以上。
    为了保证全省全面地适时完成春播计划，各地各级党委，都调动优势力量，狠抓薄弱环节，突击攻破水利“死角”，抗旱抢播。天津地区交河、吴桥、静海等八个县，各级书记挂帅，建立二百八十多个定点查墒站，根据墒情地温，指挥抢墒播种，对失墒土地，采取措施，供水抢种。
    在猛攻水利“死角”的斗争中，各地都结合播种，突击抢修农田水利。中共献县县委发现全县有三万八千亩远地高地因干旱严重不能保证播种的问题以后，立即组织了六万四千人，突击打井一千三百多眼，开渠六十一条，解决了这些水利“死角”浇水抢种的问题。定县县委为解决西部山区灵山、曲阳等四个公社的旱地播种浇水问题，分级分工包治山头苦干二十天，扩大浇地十万多亩。由于有了水，每天抢种进度比原先提高四倍多。
    在抗旱保播种的斗争中，各地人民公社充分发挥了“一大二公”的优越性，上游帮下游，先进帮后进，工农商大协作，互帮互让，大大加快了播种的速度。
    新华社太原23日电　山西各地掀起了抗旱春播高潮。目前全省农村有70％以上的劳力，正千方百计抗旱抢墒突击下种。据最近统计，全省已种各种春播作物一千二百二十二万亩，进度之快，质量之高，超过了以往任何一年。
    山西各地去冬今春水利建设获得巨大成就，给抗旱春播提供了良好的条件。但是旱象仍在继续发展，为尽力扩大春浇面积，保证春播顺利进行，目前全省仍有一百多万劳力，突击当前受益水利工程和开展春灌。大同市郊计划夏初才完成的一个中型水库，经过抢修突击，提前三十天筑成，春浇土地七千多亩。忻定县大兴共产主义协作之风，八个公社统一布置，挖了长达一百二十公里的五条干渠，把全县四条河流里的水连在一起，使水的利用率由过去的40％左右，提高到70％，在最近半月内新增加灌溉面积三十二万亩。
    各地在抢修水利的同时，都提早动手，抢墒下种。晋南、晋东南各人民公社，今年从春分就开始了春播，普遍比往年提早一个节令，动手较早的阳城县到本月中旬已播种谷子、棉花、大麻、蔬菜等作物二十五万九千多亩，占春播计划总面积81％。蒲县、芮城等县，根据往年抗旱经验，播种中进行了作物和墒情排队，采用了先种谷子、油料和夏杂粮，后种豆子、玉米、高粱、薯类，先种阳坡，后种阴坡，先种高原，后种低洼，先种旱地，后种水地，先种沙土地，后种粘土地等抢墒下种办法，使播种进度大大加快。
    据新华社兰州23日电　甘肃省目前有一百四十多万劳动大军，正在千方百计挖掘水源，积极抗旱抢墒播种。截至4月20日，全省已播春小麦、青稞和豌豆等夏秋作物二千三百万亩，进度比去年同期快40％。据检查，播种的作物中，一类田占90％，二类田占8％，三类田只有2％。
    今年，甘肃省在久旱少雨的情况下，播种工作所以能进行得又多又快又好，主要是从去冬以来，开展了规模宏大的水利建设运动。同时，各地又积极开发和利用地下水。从去冬到现在，全省共打井二十六万九千眼，挖泉二十六万多处，可扩大灌溉面积一百六十八万亩。全省干旱最重的白银市，从去年10月以来，仅开发的地下水，就扩大了十八万亩水浇地，比解放十年来发展水浇地的总和还多一万多亩。庆阳县董志塬，在开发利用地下水的工作中，也挖了十七万眼筒井，使原来没有一亩水地的黄土高原发展了四十五万亩水地。各地大量开发和利用地下水的结果，使许多原来认为没有兴修水利条件的地区，都兴修了大量水利工程，从而使全省的春灌面积空前扩大，速度加快。到4月15日，全省已春灌六百八十二万亩，保证了在严重干旱的情况下，及时进行春耕播种。
    据新华社西安23日电　陕西各地正在开展抗旱抢墒播种运动。截至目前，全省已播种各种秋熟作物八百五十多万亩（不包括春麦、夏杂、洋芋）。春播日进度已由4月上旬的三万八千亩增加到五万多亩。
    陕西省各地从2月中旬到现在，先后降了四次雨雪，这对适时春播提供了有利条件。但是每次降雨量都不够大，而且也不平衡，全省旱象还没消除。为了适时完成春播任务，各地从4月份以来，就掀起了大规模的抗旱抢墒播种运动。在运动中，全省各级党的组织都大力加强对抗旱播种的领导。陕北、关中、陕南许多县市都把抗旱指挥部搬到了田间办公。汉中专区宁强县从4月中旬以来也抽调了一百多名干部，用分片包干的方法帮助生产大队开展抗旱抢墒播种运动。
    在抢墒播种的同时，各地还开展了蓄水保水运动。
    新华社贵阳23日电　贵州省掀起了以春播保苗为中心的抗旱运动。各地受旱农田已有80％得到了灌溉，保证了春播适时进行。全省水稻育秧已达二百五十六万亩，并且已栽水稻十万多亩。
    今春旱象一露头，各地各级党委就及时领导群众掀起了抗旱斗争。旱象比较严重的毕节、安顺、黔南等地区，有一百六十多万人投入了抗旱运动。各地机关干部、学生、城镇居民也参加了抗旱。都匀市组织了一万多机关干部和学生支援郊区公社挖掘水源和车水抗旱，在六天中他们和两万五千多社员一道，使70％到85％的受旱作物和田地得到了灌溉。
    各地人民公社在抗旱中开展大协作，按照等价交换的原则，调剂水源好的水田作秧田，保证了水稻及时播种育秧。各地公社的社办农具厂等，都赶制提水工具，支援抗旱。
