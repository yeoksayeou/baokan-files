    Promoting Frugal Accounting
    “Even with vast wealth, one cannot be without diligence and thrift; to run the commune well, diligence and thrift must come first.” This is a saying that Han Baoshan, the accountant of the Dikouwang Production Team of the Bozhen Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei Province, often says. Since the day he became an accountant, he has carefully considered every penny spent, always asking himself and his conscience repeatedly.
    Han Baoshan is a good accountant and also a good propagandist for implementing diligence and thrift in running the commune. Whether at production team leader meetings, cook meetings, or feeder meetings, he always uses these as opportunities to promote diligence and thrift. During the spring plowing season, livestock needed to eat green grass. He learned that the team's green grass was insufficient, so he promoted everywhere, saying: "Now all expenses should be centered on production. Invest one yuan in the spring, and reap a hundred in the fall. The team is short of green grass. We can chop the existing green grass, bean stalks, and wheat straw into a three-in-one grass mix. The livestock likes to eat it and it gains weight. It's just a little more trouble to chop the grass. I hope the team leaders will do more work." The production team leaders and feeders were all present, and everyone agreed with the accountant's opinion, saving the money for buying green grass and investing it in spring plowing production.
    Recently, the members of the transportation team requested to buy cloth to make pockets. Han Baoshan calculated that one cloth pocket requires one zhang and five chi of cloth, and ten pockets would require fifteen zhang... Reaching this point, he decided to find a pile of old burlap sacks in the warehouse and use two burlap sacks to make one bag. Without spending a penny, the pocket bags were made.

    提倡勤俭的会计
    “家有钱财万贯，担不得不勤不俭；要办好公社，必须勤俭为先”。这是河北省交河县泊镇公社堤口王生产队的会计韩保山常常说的一句话。他自从担任会计那一天起，那怕是花一分钱，总是心问口，口问心地盘算几遍。
    韩保山是一个好会计，也是一个贯彻勤俭办社的好宣传员。无论在生产小队长会、炊事员会、饲养员会都是他进行勤俭节约宣传的好场合。春耕的时候，牲口需要吃青草，他了解到队里的青草不足，就到处宣传说：“现在一切开支要以生产为中心，春投一元，秋收一百。队里缺青草，咱们可以把现有的青草和豆秸、麦秆一起铡成三合草，牲口爱吃又上膘，就是铡草时麻烦一点，希望小队长多做一些工作。”生产小队长和饲养员都在场，大家都同意会计的意见，省下了买青草的钱，投入到春耕生产中去。
    最近，运输队的队员要求买布做口袋。韩保山一盘算，一个布口袋要一丈五尺布，十个口袋就要十五丈……算到这里，他决定到仓库里找到一堆破旧的麻袋，用两个麻袋做一个包，没用一个钱，就把口袋包做好了。（中共交河县委会）
