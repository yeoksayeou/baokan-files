Zhu Ziqi's Report to the Third Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
    Eradicating Imperialist Forces is the Primary Task of the Asian and African People
    Socialist Countries Support the National Independence Movement of Asia and Africa
  　Kitazawa Masao Exposes in Speech
    The Nature of U.S. Imperialism Has Not Changed
    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 13th—Zhu Ziqi, Chinese Secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, delivered a report at the meeting of the Third Committee (Cultural and Social Committee) of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

    Zhu Ziqi said that for the people of Asian and African countries, the most urgent and primary task is to oppose and end colonial rule, get rid of and eliminate the control and shackles of imperialist aggressive forces, and thoroughly eradicate its influence in all aspects, so that social problems can be solved and society can progress.

    He said that all social welfare plans should be closely linked to the cause of complete liberation from various imperialist pressures.

    He said that recent liberation movements have proven that only when the people fully realize that their efforts are benefiting themselves, not foreign oppressive forces or domestic exploiters, can the creative and constructive forces of a country be brought into play.

    When talking about the youth of Asia and Africa, Zhu Ziqi said that in the two years since the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held in Cairo, the broad masses of young people in Asia and Africa have demonstrated an indomitable, heroic, and tenacious spirit in the struggle of the Asian and African people to win and defend national independence. The aggression and plunder of imperialism and colonialism have brought them unemployment, hunger, and poverty, making it impossible for them to use their wisdom and talents to serve the welfare and prosperity of their people and countries.

    Speaking of the Asian and African women's movement, Zhu Ziqi pointed out that more and more women are participating in the struggle against imperialism. Especially as the struggle of the African people has risen higher and higher, African women who have experienced deep suffering have gradually awakened, and they have plunged into the irresistible torrent of the anti-imperialist struggle. They fully understand that without true independence, there is no true happiness for women.

    Zhu Ziqi said that the broad masses of workers in Asia and Africa are playing an increasingly significant role in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace. The united struggle of workers in various African countries has made significant progress.

    When talking about social welfare issues, Zhu Ziqi said that in order to fundamentally solve economic problems, the people of Asian and African countries must mainly rely on their own strength, that is, to fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.

    He said that the people of Asian and African countries have shown deep concern and sympathy for each other during the long years of suffering common hardships. At the same time, the national independence movement in Asia and Africa has been fully sympathized with and supported by socialist countries. When they establish national economies and develop social welfare, they can also expect to receive sincere and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    He said that U.S. imperialism is not only the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asian and African countries, but also the common enemy of the people of the whole world. U.S. imperialism has undertaken the self-appointed task of "world police" to suppress the national and democratic movements of all colonial and semi-colonial countries. In his report, he condemned the U.S. arms race and war preparations. He said that the United States has shown that the aggressive and war policies that the United States is currently pursuing are the main cause of undermining peace in Asia and Africa, causing poverty and backwardness in Asia and Africa, instability in people's lives, and social chaos and tension.

    Kitazawa Masao, the Japanese Secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, delivered a report on the struggle to ban nuclear weapons and for the liberation of the people of Asian and African countries.

    When talking about the war preparations of the imperialists, especially the U.S. imperialists, and the strong movement in Asia and Africa against atomic weapons, Kitazawa Masao said that it is very regrettable that at the beginning of 1960, the U.S. imperialists proposed to resume nuclear testing, then concluded a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and soon after, there was the heinous activity of conducting atomic tests in the Sahara. He said that from these facts, we can see the true face of imperialism.

    He pointed out that while the United States is making some peaceful gestures aimed at deceiving the people of the world, on the other hand, they are still vigorously carrying out arms expansion and war preparations. We can see that the United States is fanning the flames in Japan and West Germany, and the typical consequence of this recently is the rapid revival of militarism there. These facts prove that the nature of imperialism has not changed, it is just playing some new tricks.

### 肃清帝国主义势力是亚非人民首要任务

    朱子奇在亚非人民团结大会第三委员会作报告
    肃清帝国主义势力是亚非人民首要任务
    社会主义国家支持亚非民族独立运动
  　美帝国主义是亚非人民最凶恶的敌人北泽政雄在发言中揭露
    美国帝国主义本性未改
    新华社科纳克里13日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处中国书记朱子奇在第二届亚非人民团结大会第三委员会（文化和社会委员会）会议上作了报告。
    朱子奇说，对于亚非各国人民来说，刻不容缓的首要任务是反对和结束殖民统治，摆脱和消除帝国主义侵略势力的控制和束缚，并彻底肃清它在各方面的影响，以便使社会问题得到解决，使社会得到进步。
    他说，一切社会福利计划都应当同各种帝国主义压力下彻底解放出来的事业紧密地联系起来。
    他说，最近的解放运动已经证明，只有在人民充分认识到他们的努力是为他们自己造福，而不是为了外来的压迫力量，或者是为了国内的剥削者，一个国家的创造力量和建设力量才能发挥出来。
    朱子奇在谈到亚非的青年时说，自第一届亚非人民团结大会在开罗举行以来的两年中，亚非广大的青年群众在亚非人民争取和保卫民族独立的斗争中表现了不屈不挠、英勇顽强的气概。帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和掠夺给他们带来了失业、饥饿和贫穷，使他们不可能用他们的智慧和才能为自己的人民和国家的福利和繁荣服务。
    谈到亚非妇女运动，朱子奇指出，愈来愈多的妇女参加了反对帝国主义的斗争。特别是由于非洲人民的斗争日益高涨，经历深切痛苦的非洲妇女日渐觉醒了，她们投入了势不可当的反帝斗争的洪流。她们充分懂得，没有真正的独立，就没有妇女真正的幸福。
    朱子奇说，亚非广大的工人群众在反对帝国主义和维护世界和平的斗争中起着越来越显著的作用。各个非洲国家的工人的联合斗争已经有了重大的发展。
    朱子奇在谈到社会福利问题时说，为了从根本上解决经济问题，亚非各国人民必须主要依靠他们自己的力量，这就是说，要充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性。
    他说，亚非各国人民在遭受共同苦难的悠久岁月中，彼此表现出深切的关怀和同情。同时，亚非的民族独立运动完全获得社会主义国家的同情和支持。在他们建立民族经济和发展社会福利的时候，他们也可以指望得到苏联和其他社会主义国家真诚无私的援助。
    他说，美帝国主义不仅是亚非各国人民最凶恶的敌人，它也是全世界人民的公敌。美帝国主义者已经承担了镇压一切殖民地和半殖民地国家民族和民主运动的自封的“世界宪兵”的任务。他在报告中谴责美国的扩军备战。他说，美国已经表明美国现在正在执行的侵略和战争政策是破坏亚非地区和平，造成亚非地区贫穷和落后、人民生活不安定、社会混乱和紧张的主要原因。
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处日本书记北泽政雄作了关于为禁止核武器和为亚非各国人民的解放而斗争的报告。
    北泽政雄在谈到帝国主义者、特别是美帝国主义者的战争准备和亚非强烈反对原子武器的运动时说，令人非常遗憾的是，在1960年一开始，美帝国主义者就建议恢复核试验，接着缔结了新的日美“安全条约”，不久又出现在撒哈拉进行原子试验的罪恶活动。他说，从这些事实中，我们可以看到帝国主义的真面目。
    他指出，美国一方面作出一些旨在欺骗全世界人民的和平姿态，另一方面他们仍在大力进行扩军备战。我们可以看到，美国在日本和西德煽风点火，在最近造成的典型后果就是在那里迅速复活军国主义。这些事实证明，帝国主义的本性未改，它只是在耍一些新花招而已。
