Tsinghua University's Education Revolution
Speech by Delegate Jiang Nanxiang

I completely agree with the three reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Since the reorganization of departments and faculties at Tsinghua University in 1952, an educational reform has been carried out. After the Party Central Committee proposed the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor in 1958, Tsinghua University launched another, more profound revolution. I will now report to the congress on the simple situation of the educational revolution at Tsinghua University in the past two years.

I. Bringing Production into the School, Implementing the Combination of Teaching, Production, and Scientific Research.

The first important step for Tsinghua University in implementing the central educational policy was to resolutely bring productive labor into the school, making productive labor an important component of the school's teaching plan. Bringing production into the school not only powerfully promoted the school's teaching and scientific research work but also changed the school's face, embarking on a completely new path of development. Because the school no longer only trains cadres but also manufactures products and extensively carries out mass scientific research, it gradually formed a "three-in-one base" of teaching, production, and scientific research.

When the school started engaging in production, some people doubted, some opposed, and some were full of worries. They said: Institutions of higher learning are places for studying knowledge, wouldn't teachers and students participating in productive labor be "neglecting their proper duties" and wasting time? Wouldn't it divert energy and reduce teaching quality?

What were the results of Tsinghua University introducing productive labor into the school? Practice has proved that after conscientiously implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, the quality of education has not decreased but has greatly improved. For example, in the past, first-year university students often found it difficult to learn "Projective Geometry" because their "spatial concepts" were unclear, and many people called "Projective Geometry" "headache geometry." However, after the students participated in the labor of manufacturing various production products, they no longer felt a "headache" when learning "Projective Geometry" but found it easy to understand. "Mechanical Parts" is an important basic technical course. After the students participated in productive labor in the machine factory, they not only mastered a lot of the content in the textbook before learning this course, but some were even able to design certain mechanical parts themselves, thereby greatly improving the teaching quality of this course. Some students in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering were originally unwilling to study hydraulic engineering, but after they went to the Miyun Reservoir construction site to participate in productive labor, witnessed the great scene of 200,000 laborers engaging in large-scale water conservancy construction, and personally experienced the important significance of water conservancy for the country's socialist construction, everyone's thinking underwent great changes, and they all resolved to be red water conservancy builders. Some students also wrote poems to praise their major and labor:

　　Building a reservoir, the heroes have boundless strength, moving a peak of happiness;
　　Blocking the golden water of happiness, washing away the poverty of the people for generations.
　　　　　　　＊　　　＊　　　＊
　　I use the Earth as a bronze drum, beating it until the mountains and rivers dance together;
　　Today I hammer it hundreds of times, tomorrow I will generate billions of degrees of electricity.

The facts are very clear: student participation in productive labor better embodies the principles of combining theory with practice, combining mental labor with physical labor, and combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, bringing many positive effects to education.

The fact that combining with production greatly improves teaching quality is concentratedly manifested in graduation design work.

Graduation design is the last "process" in the training of students in engineering colleges, and it is also the most important link in the teaching process. Past graduation designs generally did not combine with actual production, but only conducted "hypothetical designs." Under this teaching method, students only received "armchair strategist"-style training. According to the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, Tsinghua University began to combine with actual production tasks for graduation design in 1958, that is, to undertake and complete a certain actual production or scientific research task as the topic of the graduation design, developing the "imaginary exercise battle" into "real-sword real-gun actual combat." This is a major measure, which has caused a series of revolutionary changes in teaching work and promoted a new educational revolution in the school.

To complete actual production tasks in graduation design, it is necessary to be responsible for actual production, which naturally promotes teachers and students to work with greater enthusiasm and sense of responsibility; promotes them to study and understand the Party's relevant policies more conscientiously; promotes them to overcome difficulties in every possible way instead of avoiding them; and promotes them to take the mass line, conduct multifaceted investigation and research work and organizational work, thereby more powerfully promoting the school's scientific research work and more comprehensively improving students' independent working ability and professional level. The process of carrying out graduation design in this way is also the process of completing production tasks, the process of carrying out scientific research, and the process of implementing the Party's relevant policies and improving the political and ideological level of teachers and students. In this way, graduation design becomes an important combination point for teaching, production, scientific research, and ideological work in the school, and the successful completion of graduation design also means achieving a comprehensive harvest in teaching, production, scientific research, and ideological work.

Through the work of graduation design, Tsinghua University has completed a considerable number of actual production and scientific research tasks for the country in the past two years. Many projects, such as the design of the Miyun Reservoir, the electronic computer program-controlled machine tool, the micro-car, and several important architectural projects in the capital, have reached a relatively advanced level of science and technology and have considerable national economic significance. The political and professional level and independent working ability of graduates have also been significantly improved. After they arrive at their work posts, they can generally immediately take charge of certain engineering and technical tasks.

The facts are very clear: under the guidance of the Party's general line and the Party's education policy, the contribution of new China's institutions of higher learning to the country's construction and the level reached in science are incomparable to and beyond the reach of old China's institutions of higher learning. Looking back at the universities of old China, education was completely divorced from production, which not only fostered the wrong ideological habits of intellectuals despising labor and laborers but also caused the teaching content of higher engineering colleges to lag far behind production reality, so that engineering students, after graduating from university, were often at a loss on the production site and unable to adapt to the requirements of actual work. Comparing the past and the present, which higher education system is better? Which period had higher education quality and scientific level? Isn't it obvious?

II. Adhering to the Mass Line and Extensively Carrying Out Mass Movements.

After production was introduced into the school, the school undertook an increasing number of major production tasks. Many major projects that were relatively comprehensive and involved a wide range of businesses could not be completed solely by a few teachers and students or a single major or department. It was necessary to organize teachers, students, and workers from relevant majors to achieve "large-scale corps, multi-arms" coordinated operations. Taking the design of the Miyun Reservoir as an example, it included various parts such as the technical design and construction design of the dam, hydropower station, and other auxiliary buildings. These tasks required not only the participation of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering but also the participation of the Departments of Civil Engineering, Architecture, and Electrical Engineering. This required the school to organize joint operations by various departments and majors. Therefore, the school's vigorous mass movement of "large-scale corps operations" was widely carried out around major graduation design tasks.

"Large-scale corps operations" can not only mobilize the wisdom and rich experience of the masses more widely; concentrate superior forces to break through technical key points, and more powerfully conquer scientific fortresses; but also break the traditional individual labor habits and individualistic psychology of intellectuals, change the research path and research methods that are divorced from reality and the masses; and also help the combination of teachers, students, and staff, which is a further development of the mass line in institutions of higher learning.

Since this year, Tsinghua University has further formed a "one-dragon." What is a "one-dragon"? This is to take the graduation design of the graduating class as the center and appropriately combine other teaching links such as the course design, teaching experiments, major assignments, and exercise classes of other grades with the graduation design task. In this way, from lower grades to higher grades, from basic courses to professional courses, it can be closely linked through the graduation design task, forming a "one-dragon" that runs through the entire teaching process, with the graduating class and major graduation design tasks as the leader, and other grades and other teaching links as the body and tail of the dragon. It enables students to undergo training in production practice and mass movements from the first grade, makes theoretical teaching constantly innovative because it is closely combined with productive labor, and makes the entire educational process more thoroughly implement the principle of close connection between theory and practice, and more reasonably reflects the development process from lower grades to higher grades in the teaching process. The combination of "large-scale corps, multi-arms, and one-dragon" combines the horizontal connection of "multi-arms" and the vertical connection of "one-dragon," thereby organically organizing the school's teaching work. In this way, it can both mobilize the masses and extensively explore directions, and concentrate forces to break through technical key points and solve major contradictions. The organizational form of "large-scale corps, multi-arms, and one-dragon" has promoted the mutual cooperation, mutual evaluation, and mutual promotion of different units and different grades. In the face of the surging mass movement, the school has not only strengthened the atmosphere of teachers teaching students, higher classes leading lower classes, and experts helping non-experts, but also constantly emerged many moving examples of students surpassing teachers, lower classes surpassing higher classes, and non-experts surpassing experts. For example, first and second-year students in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering participated in the plane stress calculation task of a certain giant dam. According to past methods, it was necessary to use partial differential equations and other higher mathematics to solve 2,200 multivariate simultaneous equations, which was a difficult task for first and second-year students. However, after they learned the basic knowledge of some mathematics, mechanics, and hydraulic structures and other courses, they organized themselves to "compete on stage," combining mathematical methods and mechanical principles to consider and making important innovations in the calculation method, greatly surpassing the old method used by teachers in the past to simply derive and calculate from mathematical formulas. The students' outstanding creation caused a shock among mathematics teachers. Another example is the trial production of lightweight building material ceramsite. A professional teacher in the Department of Civil Engineering failed to succeed after two months of experimentation, and he also expected that it would take 720 days to produce preliminary results; while more than 20 students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering fired it out in four days of public welfare labor and initially stabilized production in one week; students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering actually conquered the "cutting edge" of the Department of Civil Engineering, which caused a sensation throughout Tsinghua Garden.

In the face of new things, there are always people who oppose them. Some people say that large-scale corps operations are "chaotic and empty," and that "the collective launches satellites, and individuals become 'Leicas.'" However, the facts are contrary to their claims. The result of Tsinghua University carrying out the mass movement of "large-scale corps, multi-arms, and one-dragon" in conjunction with graduation design in the past two years is that it has completed many major production and scientific research tasks at high speed and high quality, and teachers and students have also grown up in actual struggle at an unprecedented speed.

The mass movement in the school is not only universally carried out among teachers, students, and factory workers, but also mobilizes administrative staff and family members, forming a "grand chorus" of the entire school. For example, when cooks know that students are "fighting at night" in order to rush production tasks, they take the initiative to send night meals to the construction site. In order to better serve all teachers, students, and staff in the school, more and more faculty and staff families are walking out of their homes and setting up canteens, nurseries, laundries, and sewing factories. Among them, two canteens were rated as advanced collectives in Haidian District, and a family nursery was rated as a red flag unit in Beijing. Since the school put forward the call to carry out a large-scale technical revolution, not only teaching, production, scientific research, and other fronts have actively engaged in the movement, but the life service department has also vigorously carried out technical revolution. For example, the school auditorium has realized the automation of stage lighting and curtains, and the canteen is also vigorously carrying out factoryization, mechanization, and automation. It can be imagined that mechanized and automated auditoriums, canteens, and other places can also become automated teaching laboratories at the same time. In the future, the workers managing the auditorium, the cooks, and other staff in various aspects may also become electricians, mechanics, and even technicians and engineers. They will not only be able to undertake the work of the school's life services but also may directly participate in teaching and scientific research work, and take on the tasks of experimenters, scientific researchers, or teachers.

In the past two years, Tsinghua University has also vigorously carried out large-scale collaboration inside and outside the school, making the mass movement in the education revolution develop from inside the school to outside the school. Many important production and scientific research projects undertaken by Tsinghua University in the past two years have been completed with the collaboration and support of relevant business departments, scientific research institutions, and brother schools outside the school. In addition, the school also continuously absorbs experience from outside the school through methods such as visiting exhibitions, production internships, on-site visits, and inviting talents from all aspects to the school to impart experience. At the same time, the school provides assistance to relevant units outside the school through production collaboration, technical promotion meetings, assisting factories in carrying out technical revolutions, and running spare-time universities. Facts tell us that only by resolutely opening the heavy gates of institutions of higher learning and continuously strengthening the close combination of school and social life can we more thoroughly eliminate the stale academic atmosphere of holding onto the old and admiring oneself in isolation, and make the school develop faster into a vigorous combat base in the country's socialist construction cause.

III. Strengthening Party Leadership, Adhering to Politics in Command, and Holding High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the Field of Science and Technology.

The education revolution at Tsinghua University in the past two years is a process of continuously, widely, and deeply carrying out mass movements, and also a process of continuously strengthening Party leadership and consolidating and expanding the Marxist-Leninist position. Should there be Party leadership in institutions of higher learning and in the field of science and technology? Should politics be put in command? This has been a center of debate at Tsinghua University for a long time. Some people say that institutions of higher learning are academic institutions and should speak according to academic status and implement "professorial governance," and that Party leadership is superfluous. Some people say, what is the use of Marxism-Leninism for natural sciences? It can neither replace chemical experiments nor replace mathematical calculations. Some people say, what is there to learn in politics, it is nothing more than reciting the fifteen characters of "standpoint, viewpoint, method, wholeheartedly serving the people."

However, the rich practice of the education revolution in the past two years has provided the most eloquent arguments, refuting the advocacy of emphasizing business, neglecting politics, and ignoring Party leadership.

Tsinghua University has not increased any great experts or famous professors in the past two years. Why is it able to achieve a great leap forward and a great harvest in teaching, production, and scientific research? Why is a group of young teachers and students with little knowledge and experience dare to undertake important national engineering tasks and scientific research projects, and be able to complete the tasks creatively? There can be no other explanation. In the final analysis, it is because politics is in command and Party leadership has been strengthened; it is because Mao Zedong Thought has increasingly penetrated into people's hearts and been grasped by the masses.

Chairman Mao's historical instructions in 1958 on breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, daring to think and act, and carrying forward the communist style helped all comrades in Tsinghua University more consciously get rid of the spiritual shackles of the bourgeoisie, sweep away the national inferiority complex left over from history, and greatly improve the political enthusiasm and fighting will of the broad masses. Under the enlightenment and encouragement of this guiding ideology, everyone, for any difficult task, as long as it is the need of the people and the call of the Party, will forge ahead and actively complete it, so that the teachers and students of Tsinghua University have been able to successfully complete many major production tasks and scientific research projects that seemed difficult to complete in the past two years. This cannot but show the great leading role of the Party and the infinite power of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Party's general line and a complete set of two-legged walking policies are not only the basic guiding principles for developing economic construction, but also for developing higher education and science and technology. When teachers and students in the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University designed a micro-car to replace tricycles, they used "more, faster, better, and more economical" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods" as their guiding ideology. In the design work, they insisted on starting from China's current conditions of raw materials, manufacturing, and use, and strived to make the structure of the car have the characteristics of "small, light, simple, economical, and strong," and tried to achieve "saving metal, easy to manufacture, easy to drive, suitable for urban and rural traffic." Now the design of this micro-car with local characteristics has been finalized and has begun to be put into production. The completion of this task not only improved the theoretical teaching work of the automotive major in the Department of Power Engineering but also improved the ideological awareness and policy level of the masses. Teachers and students at Tsinghua University have deeply realized from practice that technology must serve and obey politics. Only by conscientiously implementing the general line and the Party's complete set of two-legged walking policies can we develop science and technology at high speed and stimulate the greatest creativity of the broad masses.

In order to strengthen the Party's ideological leadership, teachers and students at Tsinghua University have launched a study movement of studying Marxism-Leninism, especially studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works, in the past two years. A large number of facts show that studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has not only improved the political level of all teachers and students in the school but also provided them with correct guidance in methodology in scientific research work. The solution of the stability problem of the electronic computer for the program-controlled machine tool by students in the Department of Electrical Engineering is a practical example. At the beginning, the electronic computer was always unstable, and its work did not obey commands, and various strange phenomena occurred. Different people contacting it would have different phenomena. Everyone had no way to deal with it and called it a "madman." They were worried when working, fearing that it would "go crazy." Some people therefore believed that the law of stability was "unknowable" and had to guess blindly. After they studied Chairman Mao's philosophical works, they understood that objective things have laws and are knowable; that phenomena are reflections of essence, and that essence can be grasped through phenomena. They understood that contradictions are universally present, and that only by exposing contradictions can contradictions be resolved, and that avoiding contradictions or guessing blindly cannot solve problems. Therefore, everyone's understanding became clear, and their confidence greatly increased. They were no longer afraid of strange phenomena, recognizing that these phenomena were providing good clues for finding the essence. Therefore, they not only did not avoid it but welcomed it and even wanted to deliberately use difficult problems to test the computer and actively cause strange phenomena to investigate. In this way, finally, through phenomena, they grasped the essence and found the reason why it "went crazy." For example, it was found that different people contacting it would have different phenomena because some people wore cloth shoes and some people wore leather shoes, and the grounding insulation was different, so it also had different effects on the computer. They also analyzed the external and internal causes of the computer's "going crazy" according to Chairman Mao's theory of contradiction that external causes must play a role through internal causes, and decided to first focus on improving the internal anti-interference performance of the computer, rather than relying solely on avoiding external interference to solve the problem. In this way, through purposeful practice, actively exposing contradictions and resolving contradictions, they finally quickly cured the electronic computer's "madness" and enabled it to produce stably. The students therefore excitedly said: "This is Chairman Mao's Thought guiding us to reveal the law of stability of the computer and breaking through agnosticism." Now many students not only put technical materials on their design desks but also put the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. They said: "If the design cannot be done, consult Chairman Mao."

In 1958, Chairman Mao pointed out when he inspected Tianjin University that institutions of higher learning should grasp three things: first, Party committee leadership; second, the mass line; and third, combining education with productive labor. The practice of Tsinghua University's in-depth education revolution in the past two years has brilliantly confirmed that Chairman Mao's judgment is completely correct. Conscientiously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions is the fundamental guarantee for successfully carrying out the education revolution in our country's institutions of higher learning.

    清华大学的教育革命
    蒋南翔代表的发言
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理的三个报告和人大常委会的工作报告。
    清华大学在1952年实行院系调整以后，开展了一次教育改革。1958年党中央提出教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以后，清华大学又一次开展了更深刻的革命。我现在向大会汇报一下清华大学两年来教育革命的简单情况。
    一、把生产引进学校，实行教学、生产和科学研究三结合。
    清华大学执行中央教育方针的第一个重要步骤，就是坚决地把生产劳动引进学校，使生产劳动成为学校教学计划的一个重要组成部分。生产引进学校，不但有力地促进了学校的教学工作和科学研究工作，而且使学校改变了面貌，走上了完全新的发展道路。因为学校不再是仅仅培养干部，同时还制造产品，广泛开展群众性的科学研究，逐渐形成为教学、生产和科学研究的“三联基地”。
    学校在开始搞生产的时候，有人怀疑，有人反对，也有人忧虑重重。他们说：高等学校是研究学问的地方，教师学生参加生产劳动，岂不是“不务正业”、浪费时间吗？岂不要分散力量、降低教学质量吗？
    清华大学把生产劳动引入学校的结果怎样呢？实践证明：认真贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针后，教育质量不是降低了，而是大大提高了。例如过去大学一年级学生，由于“空间概念”不明确，学习“投影几何”常常感到困难，不少人把“投影几何”称为“头痛几何”。但是，当同学们参加了制造各种生产成品的劳动以后，他们对于学习“投影几何”就不再感到“头痛”而是感到容易理解了。“机械零件”是一门重要的技术基础课程，当同学们在机械工厂参加了生产劳动以后，他们不但在学习这门课程之前，就掌握了不少课本中的内容，甚至有人能够自行设计某些机械零件，因而大大提高了这门课程的教学质量。水利系有些同学本来不愿意学习水利专业，但是在他们到密云水库工地参加生产劳动，亲眼看到二十万劳动大军大搞水利建设的伟大场面，亲身体会到水利事业对于祖国社会主义建设事业的重要意义，于是大家的思想就起了很大变化，都决心要做红色的水利建设者。有的同学还创作诗歌来歌颂自己的专业和劳动：
    建库英雄力无穷，搬来一座幸福峰；
    拦住幸福黄金水，洗净人民万代穷。
                          ＊　　　＊　　　＊
    我把地球当铜鼓，敲得山河共起舞；
    今天敲它几百锤，明天发电亿万度。
    事实很明显，学生参加生产劳动是更好地体现了理论和实际结合、脑力劳动和体力劳动结合、知识分子和工农群众结合的原则，给教育工作带来了多方面的积极效果。
    结合了生产就大大提高教学质量的事实，集中地表现在毕业设计工作上。
    毕业设计是工科院校培养学生的最后一道“工序”，也是教学过程中最重要的一个环节。过去的毕业设计一般不结合实际生产，只是进行“假想设计”，在这种教学方式下，学生仅仅受到“纸上谈兵”式的训练。根据党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，清华大学在1958年起就开始结合实际生产任务进行毕业设计，也就是以承担和完成某项实际生产或科学研究任务作为毕业设计的课题，把“假想的演习战”发展为“真刀真枪的实际作战”。这是一个重大措施，这个措施引起了教学工作的一系列革命性的变化，促进了学校中新的教育革命。
    毕业设计要完成实际生产任务，就必须对实际生产负责，这就自然地推动教师和学生都以更高的热情和责任心去进行工作；推动他们更加认真地钻研和领会党的有关方针政策；推动他们千方百计地去克服困难，而不是回避困难；推动他们走群众路线，进行多方面的调查研究工作和组织工作，从而更有力地促进了学校的科学研究工作，更全面地提高了学生的独立工作能力和业务水平。这样进行毕业设计的过程，同时也是完成生产任务的过程，也是开展科学研究的过程，也是贯彻执行党的有关方针政策、提高教师、学生政治思想水平的过程。这样，毕业设计就成为学校中教学、生产、科学研究和思想工作的一个重要结合点，而毕业设计的胜利完成，同时也就意味着获得了教学、生产、科学研究和思想工作的全面丰收。
    清华大学通过毕业设计的工作，两年来为国家完成了相当数量的实际生产和科学研究任务，其中如密云水库、电子计算机程序控制机床、微型汽车和首都若干重要建筑工程的设计等许多项目，都达到比较先进的科学技术水平，和具有相当重要的国民经济意义。毕业生的政治、业务水平和独立工作能力也都有显著的提高。他们到了工作岗位以后，一般都能立即负责一定的工程技术任务。
    事实很明显，在党的总路线和党的教育方针的指导下，新中国的高等学校对祖国建设事业的贡献和在科学上所达到的水平，都是旧中国的高等学校所无法比拟和望尘莫及的。回顾一下旧中国的大学，教育与生产完全脱节，这不但养成了知识分子轻视劳动和劳动者的错误思想习惯，而且使高等工科院校的教学内容，远远落后于生产实际，以致工科学生从大学毕业，到了生产现场，往往一筹莫展，不能适应实际工作的要求。今昔相较，究竟那一种高等教育制度好？那个时期的教育质量和科学水平高？难道还不明显吗？
      二、坚持群众路线，广泛开展群众运动。
    生产引进学校以后，学校承担重大生产任务日渐增多，许多综合性较大、牵涉业务范围较广的重大项目，都不是少数教师、学生或一个专业、一个系所能单独完成，必须把有关专业的教师、学生和工人组织起来，实现“大兵团、多兵种”的协同作战。以密云水库的设计为例，其中包括水坝、水电站和其它附属建筑的技术设计和施工设计等各个部分，这些任务不仅要有水利系参加，还要有土木、建筑、电机等系参加，这就要求学校必须组织各系、各专业联合作战，因此，学校中轰轰烈烈的“大兵团作战”的群众运动，也就围绕着重大的毕业设计任务而广泛开展起来了。
    “大兵团作战”不但可以更广泛地调动群众的智慧和丰富经验；集中优势力量突击技术关键，更有力地攻克科学堡垒；而且也可以打破知识分子传统的个体劳动习惯和个人主义心理，改变那种脱离实际和脱离群众的研究道路和研究方法；也有助于教师、学生和职工的结合，这是高等学校中群众路线的进一步发展。
    今年以来，清华大学在“大兵团作战”的基础上，进一步组成了“一条龙”。什么叫“一条龙”？这就是以毕业班的毕业设计为中心，把其他各年级的课程设计、教学实验、大作业和习题课等教学环节，适当地和毕业设计任务结合起来进行。这样就可以从低年级到高年级，从基础课到专业课，通过毕业设计任务而密切联系起来，形成了以毕业班和重大的毕业设计任务为龙头，以其他年级和其他教学环节为龙身龙尾，组成了纵贯整个教学过程的“一条龙”。使学生从一年级起就经受生产实践和群众运动的锻炼，使理论教学因为与生产劳动密切结合而不断革新，使整个教育过程比较彻底地贯彻了理论与实际密切联系的原则，比较合理地反映了教学过程中从低年级到高年级的发展过程。“大兵团、多兵种、一条龙”的结合，使“多兵种”的横的联系和“一条龙”的纵的联系结合在一起，从而把全校的教学工作有机地组织起来，这样既可以发动群众，广泛探索方向；又可以集中力量突击技术关键，解决主要矛盾。“大兵团、多兵种、一条龙”的组织形式，推动了不同单位、不同年级的互相配合，互相评比，互相促进。在万马奔腾的群众运动面前，学校中不仅加强了教师教学生、高班带低班、内行帮外行的风气，而且不断涌现出学生超老师、低班超高班、外行超内行的许多动人事例。例如水利系一、二年级学生参加了某巨型水坝的平面应力计算任务，按照过去的办法，需要用偏微分方程等高等数学去解二千二百个多元联立方程式，这对一、二年级同学是艰难的任务。但是他们学习了一部分数学、力学和水工结构等课程的基本知识，就组织起来“打擂台”，把数学方法和力学原理结合起来考虑，对计算方法作了重要的革新，大大超过了过去教师所沿用的单纯从数学公式来进行推导计算的旧方法。同学们的出色创造，在数学教师中引起了震动。又如轻质建筑材料陶粒的试制工作，土木系的一位专业教师两个月未曾试验成功，他还预计需要七百二十天才能做出初步结果；而机械系的二十多位同学在四天的公益劳动中就烧制出来，一个星期就初步稳定了生产；机械系的学生竟然攻下了土木系的“尖端”，这件事情轰动了整个清华园。
    在新事物面前，反对的人总是有的。有人说：大兵团作战是“乱哄哄、一场空”，是“集体放了卫星，个人成了‘莱伊卡’”。但是事实和他们的论断相反，两年来清华大学结合毕业设计开展“大兵团、多兵种、一条龙”的群众运动的结果，是高速度、高质量地完成了许多重大的生产和科学研究任务，教师和学生也都以前所未有的速度，在实际斗争中锻炼成长起来了。
    学校中的群众运动不但在教师、学生、工厂工人中普遍展开，而且把行政职工和家属也都发动起来，形成了全校的“大合唱”。例如炊事员知道同学们为着突击生产任务而“夜战”时，他们就主动送夜餐到工地。教职工家属为了更好地为全校师生员工服务，愈来愈多地走出家庭，办起了食堂、托儿所、洗衣厂和缝纫厂。其中有两个食堂被评为海淀区先进集体，一个家属托儿所被评为北京市的红旗单位。自从学校提出大搞技术革命的号召后，不但教学、生产、科学研究等各条战线都积极投入运动，生活服务部门也大搞技术革命，如学校礼堂已实现了舞台灯光和帷幕的自动化，食堂也正在大搞工厂化、机械化和自动化。可以设想：实现了机械化、自动化的礼堂、食堂等场所，都可以同时成为自动化的教学实验室，将来管理礼堂的工人、炊事员以及其它各方面职工，也都可能变成电工、机械工，甚至成为技术员、工程师，他们将不仅能担负全校生活服务的工作，而且也可能直接参加教学和科学研究工作，担任起实验员、科学研究人员或教师的任务。
    两年来，清华大学还大力开展了校内外的大协作，使教育革命中的群众运动，从校内发展到校外。清华大学两年来所承担的许多重要的生产和科学研究项目，差不多都是在校外有关的业务部门、科学研究机关及兄弟学校的协作支援之下完成的。此外学校还通过参观展览会、生产实习、现场访问、请各方面能者到校传授经验等方法，源源不断地从校外吸取经验，同时学校通过生产协作、技术推广会议、协助工厂开展技术革命和开办业余大学等方法，给校外有关单位以帮助。事实告诉我们，只有坚决打开高等学府的沉重的闸门，不断加强学校和社会生活的密切结合，才能更彻底地清除那种抱残守缺、孤芳自赏的陈腐的学院气息，使学校更快地发展成为祖国社会主义建设事业中的一个生气勃勃的战斗基地。
    三、加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，在科学技术领域中更高举起毛泽东思想的红旗。
    清华大学两年来的教育革命，是不断广泛深入地开展群众运动的过程，也是不断加强党的领导，巩固和扩大马克思列宁主义阵地的过程。在高等学校和科学技术的领域中，要不要党的领导？应不应该实行政治挂帅？这曾经是清华大学长时期来的一个争论中心。有人说，高等学校是学术机关，应该按照学术地位讲话，实行“教授治校”，党的领导是多余的。有人说，马克思列宁主义对于自然科学有什么用处？它既不能代替化学试验，又不能代替数学计算。有人说，政治有什么可学的，无非是背诵一下“立场、观点、方法，全心全意为人民服务”十五个大字而已。
    但是两年来教育革命的丰富实践，提供了最雄辩的论据，批驳了重业务、轻政治、忽视党的领导的主张。
    过去两年清华大学并没有增加什么大专家、名教授，为什么能够获得教学、生产和科学研究的大跃进和大丰收呢？为什么一群学问不高，经验不多的青年师生，敢于承担国家重要的工程任务和科学研究项目，而且能够富有创造性地完成任务呢？这不能有别的解释，归根结蒂，是由于政治挂帅，加强了党的领导；是由于毛泽东思想日益深入人心，掌握了群众。
    毛主席在1958年提出的破除迷信、解放思想，敢想敢干、发扬共产主义风格等历史性的指示，帮助清华全校同志更自觉地摆脱资产阶级的精神枷锁，扫除历史遗留下来的民族自卑心理，大大提高了广大群众的政治热情和战斗意志。在这种指导思想的启发和鼓舞下，大家对于任何困难的任务，只要是人民的需要和党的号召，莫不勇往直前，积极去完成，使清华大学的师生两年以来，能够胜利完成看来很难完成的许多重大的生产任务和科学研究项目。这不能不说是显示了党的伟大的领导作用和毛泽东思想的无限威力。
    党的总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，不但是发展经济建设、而且同样是发展高等教育和科学技术的基本指导原则。清华大学动力系师生设计代替三轮车的微型汽车时，就是以“多、快、好、省”和“土洋结合”，作为指导思想，在设计工作中，坚持从中国当前的原料、制造、使用等条件出发，努力使车子的结构具有“小、轻、简、省、牢”的特点，尽量做到“节省金属、容易制造、驾驶简便、城乡通行”。现在这种带有本国特色的微型汽车的设计已经定型，开始投入生产。这一任务的完成，不仅改进了动力系汽车专业的理论教学工作，并且提高了群众的思想觉悟和政策水平。清华大学师生从实践中深刻体会到，技术必须服务和服从于政治。只有认真贯彻总路线和党的一整套两条腿走路的方针，才能高速度地发展科学技术，才能激发广大群众的最大创造性。
    为了加强党的思想领导，两年来清华大学师生开展了一个学习马克思列宁主义、特别是学习毛主席哲学著作的学习运动。大量事实说明，学习和运用毛泽东思想，不仅提高了全校师生的政治水平，而且在科学研究的工作中，使他们在方法论上得到正确的指导。电机系学生解决程序控制机床的电子计算机的稳定问题，就是一个实际例证。开始，电子计算机总不稳定，工作不听指挥，出现种种怪现象，不同的人接触它就会发生不同的现象。大家对它没有办法，叫它是“疯子”。工作时提心吊胆，就怕它“发疯”。有人因此认为稳定的规律“不可知”，只好瞎碰。他们学习了毛主席的哲学著作后，懂得了客观事物都是有规律的、可知的；现象是本质的反映，透过现象可以掌握本质。懂得了矛盾是普遍存在的，只有揭露矛盾，才能解决矛盾，回避矛盾或随意瞎碰，是不能解决问题的。于是大家认识明确，信心大增。遇到怪现象不再害怕了，认识到这些现象正是提供寻找本质的好线索，因而不但不回避它，反而欢迎它，甚至还要有意用难题来考验计算机，主动引起怪现象加以考察。这样，终于透过现象，掌握本质，找到了它“发疯”的原因。如发现不同的人接触它就出现不同的现象，是由于有人穿布鞋，有人穿皮鞋，接地绝缘不同，因而对计算机也就产生不同的影响。他们还根据毛主席矛盾论中所说外因要通过内因起作用的道理，分析了计算机“发疯”的外因和内因，决定首先要着重提高计算机内部的抗扰性能，而不能单靠回避外界的干扰去解决问题。这样，他们经过有目的的实践，主动揭露矛盾和解决矛盾，终于迅速治好了电子计算机的“疯病”，使它能够稳定生产。同学们因此兴奋地说：“这是毛主席思想指导我们揭露了计算机的稳定规律，攻破了不可知论”。现在很多同学的设计桌上不但放着技术资料，而且还放上了毛泽东选集。他们说：“设计做不出，就请教毛主席”。

    1958年毛主席在天津大学视察时曾指出，高等学校应抓住三个东西：一是党委领导；二是群众路线；三是把教育与生产劳动结合起来。清华大学两年来深入教育革命的实践，光辉地证实了毛主席论断的完全正确。认真地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，是胜利开展我国高等学校的教育革命的根本保证。
