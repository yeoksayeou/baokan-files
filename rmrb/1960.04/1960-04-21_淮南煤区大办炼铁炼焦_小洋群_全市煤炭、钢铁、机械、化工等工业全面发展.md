This newspaper, Hefei, 20th reported: Huainan City, Anhui Province, a well-known coal base in our country, based on its favorable conditions such as abundant coal resources, sufficient power supply, large reserves of limestone, and short ore transportation distances, has adopted the method of smelting coke and iron on-site to vigorously develop small foreign groups, turning a city that solely produced coal into one centered on the coal industry, with small indigenous groups and small foreign groups in iron and steel, coke, machinery, chemicals, and other industries developing in an all-round way.

During the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958, the Huainan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seriously analyzed various favorable conditions and decided to smelt coke and iron on-site to establish iron and steel enterprises. The city had no iron ore, but could transport ore back from the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company while transporting coal to Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company via the Huainan Railway. The city mobilized 100,000 people, adopting indigenous methods, to build more than 1,000 indigenous iron smelting furnaces and 1,900 indigenous coke ovens around the mine shafts. At the same time, unified planning and layout were carried out, and a part of the force was concentrated in Tianjia'an, Datong, Dongshan, Wangfenggang and other coal-producing areas with abundant power and convenient transportation to build 157 small blast furnaces of eight cubic meters or more and four large-scale indigenous coking plants. According to the needs of development, in 1959, the small blast furnaces and coke ovens were rectified in accordance with the five principles of being close to raw materials, transportation, power, water sources, and blast furnaces. At the same time, great efforts were made to construct three-ton converters, small rolling mills, and simple coal washing plants. This enabled the various small foreign groups to be further developed and consolidated, and the layout became more reasonable. By the end of 1959, the city not only had 197 small blast furnaces ranging from eight to twenty-eight cubic meters, 17 Red Flag No. 2 coke ovens, 1,016 coke ovens, and seven simple washing plants, forming 19 small iron smelting plants and four larger small foreign groups; but also built a number of small steelmaking converters, steelmaking electric furnaces, and rolling mills. Iron production reached 250,000 tons, steel reached 15,000 tons, and coke reached more than 2.11 million tons. With the expansion of the scale of iron and steel production and the improvement of technical level, the production level has also been further improved. Taking the first quarter of this year as an example, iron and steel production increased by 1.5 times and 1.2 times respectively compared with the same period last year, and coke increased by 66.92%. At the same time, various economic and technical indicators have also been significantly improved. For example, the utilization coefficient of iron and steel has increased by more than one time and one and a half times compared with the same period last year, and the qualification rate has increased by 11%. The ash content of coke has decreased by 3% compared with the same period last year, and the coking rate has increased by 5%.

Huainan City smelting coke and iron on-site not only eliminated the blank spots in the original iron and steel industry, making the small foreign groups develop rapidly, but also greatly saved railway cars and manpower in transportation. Last year, Huainan transported 1,293,922 tons of coal and 676,252 tons of coke to Ma'anshan, while 695,101 tons of ore were transported back using returning empty cars, saving a total of 17,377 railway cars based on 40 tons per car, accounting for 36% of the railway cars used to transport coking coal. Smelting coke on-site saves even more railway cars. Last year, Huainan transported 1,518,821 tons of coke to other places. If two tons of coal are used to make one ton of coke, 37,970 railway cars can be saved, a 50% reduction in railway cars compared to transporting coal.

Smelting iron and coke on-site can also timely supply the needs of steel production and promote the improvement of coal and steel production levels. For example, Huainan's coal production is large, but in the past, transportation on the surface often could not keep up with underground production, hindering the improvement of underground production. After smelting coke on-site, the coal dug out of the mine can be quickly and directly transported to the coal washing plant (coke plant), and the washed coal can be directly used for coking, and the coke can be directly transported to the blast furnace for iron smelting. This is not only short in time, but also convenient and saves transportation capacity.

Another benefit of smelting iron and coke on-site is that it can reduce the cost of coke and steel. Due to the reduction of transportation turnover by smelting iron and coke on-site, the cost of smelting one ton of coke in Huainan is generally 20% lower than that in other places, and the cost of iron is also 10% lower.

With the development of small foreign groups and small indigenous groups of iron and steel and coke, other industries in Huainan City have also been developed accordingly under the impetus of the iron and steel industry. The city originally did not have a machinery factory, but now it has established a general machinery factory and an agricultural machinery factory; it originally did not have a chemical industry, but now it has also established a fertilizer plant and a coal-to-oil plant, and has also established more than a dozen refractory material plants and brick and tile plants. This has gradually transformed a mining area that originally only produced coal into a comprehensive industrial city.

In order to further carry out the work of "smelting coke and iron on-site," Huainan City is currently preparing to put nearly 100 blast furnaces of eight cubic meters or more that have not yet been put into production into production successively after technical transformation. In terms of coking, in addition to further rectifying coke ovens and comprehensively promoting new furnace types, so that the 10 Red Flag No. 2 coke ovens and 6 Red Flag No. 3 coke ovens that have not yet been put into production will all be put into production, this year it is planned to build 16 more Red Flag No. 3 coke ovens and 4 Red Flag No. 2 coke ovens. At the same time, the scale of iron and steel enterprises will be gradually expanded.

    淮南煤区大办炼铁炼焦“小洋群”
    全市煤炭、钢铁、机械、化工等工业全面发展
    本报合肥20日电　我国著名的煤基地安徽省淮南市，根据煤炭资源丰富、电力供应充足、石灰石蕴藏量大、矿石运输距离近等有利条件，采取就煤炼焦炼铁的办法，大力发展小洋群，使一个由单一产煤的城市，变成一个以煤炭工业为中心，有钢铁、焦炭、机械、化工等小土群、小洋群全面发展的城市。
    1958年全民大办钢铁时，中共淮南市委认真分析了各种有利条件，决定就煤炼焦炼铁，建立钢铁企业。本市没有铁矿，但可通过淮南铁路，在运煤给马鞍山钢铁公司的同时，从马鞍山运回矿石。全市发动十万群众，采取土法上马的办法，在各矿井周围建立了一千多座土炼铁炉和一千九百多座土炼焦炉。同时，进行了统一规划，统一布局，集中一部分力量分别在田家庵、大通、洞山、望峰岗等电力充裕、交通方便的产煤区建立了一百五十七座八立方米以上的小高炉和四座大型土法炼焦厂。根据发展的需要，1959年又按照就原料、就交通、就动力、就水源、就高炉的五就原则，对小高炉和炼焦炉进行了整顿。同时，大抓三吨转炉、小型轧钢机，以及简易选煤厂等的建设。这样就使各种小洋群得到进一步发展和巩固，布局也更为合理。到1959年底，全市不仅拥有八立方米至二十八立方米的小高炉一百九十七座，红旗二号焦炉十七座，炼焦炉一千零一十六座，简易洗选厂七座，形成了十九个小炼铁厂和四个较大的小洋群；而且还建成了一批小型炼钢转炉、炼钢电炉和轧钢机。铁产量达二十五万吨，钢达一万五千吨，焦炭达到二百一十一万多吨。随着钢铁生产规模的扩大、技术水平的提高，生产水平也进一步提高了。以今年第一季度为例，钢铁产量比去年同期增长了一点五倍和一点二倍，焦炭增长了66.92％。与此同时，各种经济技术指标也有显著提高。如钢铁利用系数比去年同期提高一倍和一倍半以上，合格率提高11％。焦的灰分比去年同期下降3％，结焦率提高5％。
    淮南市就煤炼焦炼铁，不仅消减了原来钢铁工业的空白点，使小洋群得到飞快的发展，而且在运输上也大大节约了车皮和人力。去年一年淮南运往马鞍山的煤炭是一百二十九万三千九百二十二吨，焦六十七万六千二百五十二吨，而利用回空车运回的矿石是六十九万五千一百零一吨，以每车装四十吨计算，共节约车皮一万七千三百七十七辆，占运焦煤车皮的36％。就煤炼焦节约车皮更多，去年一年淮南运往外地的焦炭达一百五十一万八千八百二十一吨，若以两吨煤炼一吨焦计算，即可节约车皮三万七千九百七十辆，比运煤减少50％的车皮。
    就煤炼铁炼焦，还可以及时供应钢铁生产的需要，促进煤和钢铁生产水平的提高。如淮南煤产量大，过去往往井上运输跟不上井下生产，阻碍了井下产量的提高。就煤炼焦后，矿井里挖出来的煤，可以很快地直接运到洗煤厂（焦厂），洗出的煤可以直接炼焦，炼出的焦也可以直接运往高炉炼铁。这样时间既短，又方便又节省运力。
    就地炼铁炼焦的另一个好处，是可以降低焦炭、钢铁的成本。由于就煤炼铁炼焦减少了运输周转，淮南炼一吨焦的成本，一般要比外地低20％，铁也要低10％。
    随着钢铁、焦炭小洋群、小土群的发展，在钢铁工业的带动下，淮南市的其他工业也得到了相应的发展。这个市原来没有机械厂，现在办起了通用机械厂、农业机械厂；原来没有化学工业，现在也建立了化肥厂和煤炼油厂，同时还建立了十多座耐火材料厂和砖瓦厂。这样就使一个原来单一生产煤炭的矿区逐渐形成一个综合性的工业城市了。
    为了进一步开展“就煤炼焦炼铁”的工作，目前淮南市正准备把近一百座未投入生产的八立方米以上的高炉经过技术改造陆续投入生产。在炼焦方面，除进一步整顿焦炉，全面推广新的炉型，使未投入生产的十座红旗二号焦炉和六座红旗三号焦炉全部投入生产外，今年计划再建红旗三号焦炉十六座、红旗二号焦炉四座。同时，要逐步扩大钢铁企业的规模。
