Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd - Over seven thousand spectators in the capital, enjoying their weekend, watched two very exciting international basketball games tonight at the Beijing Sports馆比赛馆. After a tenacious fight, the Soviet "Dynamo" men's basketball team defeated the Chinese "Pioneer" men's basketball team with a score of 66 to 62, thus achieving a decisive victory in the competition for the championship of the first men's basketball tournament of the Public Security Sports Organizations of Socialist Countries.

    The Polish "Guards" team defeated the Romanian "Dynamo" team tonight with a score of 65 to 50, bringing their current record to two wins and one loss in three games.

    The game between the Soviet "Dynamo" team and the Chinese "Pioneer" team was extremely intense. Both teams fielded their strongest lineups tonight. In the first three minutes of the game, the two sides tied four times at 2-2, 4-4, 6-6, and 7-7. However, soon the Soviet "Dynamo" team gained an advantage in scoring and maintained it throughout. At the end of the first half, they led 36 to 28.

    Tonight, the Soviet "Dynamo" team not only had an advantage in player height, but their fast and skillful passing and accurate shooting techniques caused many gaps in the "Pioneer" team's defense. The "Dynamo" team's retreat speed was also very fast, making it difficult for the "Pioneer" team, which is good at fast breaks, to launch quick attacks.

    The Chinese "Pioneer" team's shooting was not accurate enough tonight. Although they adopted a full-court press and man-to-man defense for a long time, they were unable to contain Korneev (No. 11), who is 1.98 meters tall. Korneev performed the best tonight, scoring thirty-two points alone.

    Hungarian international basketball referee Vencai and German Democratic Republic international basketball referee Herschel officiated this fierce game.

    The game between the Polish "Guards" team and the Romanian "Dynamo" team was also decisive in determining who would be the third-place winner in this competition, so the competition between the two sides was also quite fierce. However, the Romanian "Dynamo" team's offensive speed was slower, and they were unable to grab rebounds, so they trailed their opponents by nine points at the end of the first half, with a score of 19 to 28.

    In the second half, although the Romanian "Dynamo" team launched many tenacious counterattacks, they still failed with a score of 50 to 65 in the end due to their slow offensive speed, which allowed the opponents to defend calmly.

    The referees for this game were Soviet international basketball referee Ginin and Chinese national basketball referee Wang Chang'an.

    The first men's basketball tournament of the Public Security Sports Organizations of Socialist Countries will hold the final two games tomorrow night. In addition to the Soviet-Polish game, the Chinese "Pioneer" team, which has two wins and one loss in three games, will play against the Public Security Team of the Mongolian People's Republic, which has three losses in three games. The Romanian "Dynamo" team has already completed all four games, with a record of one win and three losses.

    社会主义国家公安体育组织
    举行两场精彩篮球赛
    据新华社22日讯　七千多名欢度周末的首都观众，今晚在北京体育馆比赛馆观看了两场非常精彩的国际篮球比赛。苏联“狄纳莫”男子篮球队经过顽强奋战，以六十六比六十二赢了中国“前卫”男子篮球队，从而为争夺社会主义国家公安体育组织第一届男子篮球比赛的冠军，取得了有决定意义的胜利。
    波兰“近卫军”队今晚以六十五比五十战胜了罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队，目前的战绩是三战两胜一负。
    苏联“狄纳莫”队同中国“前卫”队的比赛，极为紧张。两队今晚都以最强的阵容出场。比赛的头三分多钟，双方就曾打成二平、四平、六平、七平四次平局。但不久苏联“狄纳莫”队就取得了得分一直领先的优势。上半场结束时，他们以三十六比二十八领先。
    苏联“狄纳莫”队今晚不仅在队员身材高度上占了优势，他们快速、熟练的传球配合和准确的投篮技巧，使“前卫”队的防线屡出漏洞。“狄纳莫”队退守的速度也非常快，这样就使得善于打快攻的“前卫”队很难发动快速的进攻。
    中国“前卫”队今晚投篮不够准，在防守时虽然长时间采取全场紧逼人盯人的战术，但却始终不能看住对方身高一米九十八的科尔?耶夫（11号）。科尔?耶夫今晚表演最为出色，一个人独得三十二分。
    匈牙利篮球国际裁判文蔡和德意志民主共和国篮球国际裁判赫歇尔担任了这场激烈比赛的裁判工作。
    波兰“近卫军”队和罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队的比赛，对决定谁是这次比赛的第三名也有决定性意义，因而双方争夺也相当激烈。但罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队进攻速度较慢，加上篮板球抢不过对方，到上半场结束时就以十九比二十八落后于对方九分。
    下半场罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队虽然多次顽强反攻，但仍由于进攻速度较慢，使对方能够从容防守，最后终以五十比六十五失败。
    担任这场裁判工作的是苏联篮球国际裁判吉宁和中国篮球国家裁判王长安。
    社会主义国家公安体育组织第一届男子篮球比赛明晚将举行最后两场比赛，除苏—波队一场比赛外，已经三战二胜一负的中国“前卫”队将同三战三负的蒙古人民共和国公安队举行比赛。罗马尼亚“狄纳莫”队已经赛完全部四场比赛，战绩是一胜三负。
