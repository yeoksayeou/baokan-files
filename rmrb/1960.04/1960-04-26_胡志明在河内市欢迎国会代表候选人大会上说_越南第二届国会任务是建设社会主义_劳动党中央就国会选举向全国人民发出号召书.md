Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 25th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report: President Ho Chi Minh, as a candidate for the National Assembly representing the Ba Dinh district of Hanoi, delivered a speech on the evening of the 24th at a rally welcoming the Hanoi National Assembly candidates.

Ho Chi Minh compared the reactionary, deceptive election laws of capitalist countries and the "general election" in South Vietnam with the democratic election laws of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said, "Given the genuinely democratic nature of our election laws, our National Assembly will be a true representative of the people's interests."

He said, "The First National Assembly was a fighting National Assembly. It united the people and helped the government lead the resistance war to a glorious victory."

He continued, the Second National Assembly must be a National Assembly working to build socialism in North Vietnam. The future National Assembly must have competent representatives—representatives who serve the motherland, the people, and socialism wholeheartedly. Choosing these representatives is every voter's right and obligation.

Ho Chi Minh then called on the people of Hanoi to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy after the election in order to complete the 1960 plan and prepare for the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan.

He said that under the leadership of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve victory in building socialism in North Vietnam and in striving for the reunification of the country.

Present at the meeting were Le Duan, Truong Chinh, and Pham Hung, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party, as well as labor heroes nominated as candidates and members of various political parties and people's organizations.

The election for the Second National Assembly of Vietnam will be held on May 8th.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 23rd: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party's appeal regarding the election of the Second National Assembly was published here today.

The appeal said, "The election of the Second National Assembly is an extremely important political movement aimed at vigorously promoting the cause of socialist construction in the North and striving for the reunification of the motherland."

The appeal called on the people to carefully select those who are both virtuous and talented and who can best represent the will of the people of the whole country as representatives to the Second National Assembly.

The appeal said that the Second National Assembly will inherit the cause of the First National Assembly and will certainly be able to complete the glorious task of mobilizing the people of the whole country to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and contribute to the consolidation of peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: Vietnam News Agency reported that, according to preliminary figures, a total of 458 candidates in North Vietnam are participating in the election of the Second National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which will be held on May 8th. This election will elect 362 representatives.

Vietnamese election law stipulates that the list of candidates must be announced within twenty days before the election. All provinces announced their lists of candidates on the 18th.

The news said that, according to incomplete statistics, the candidates include 55 women, 66 ethnic minorities, and 20 military personnel.

Hanoi will elect 30 representatives, and a total of 39 candidates have been nominated. The list of candidates for Hanoi, which was announced yesterday, includes President Ho Chi Minh, Le Duan, Truong Chinh, and Pham Hung, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party, as well as Nguyen Xien, General Secretary of the Vietnam Socialist Party, and Nghiem Xuan Yem, General Secretary of the Vietnam Democratic Party.

    他说，“第一届国会是一个战斗的国会。它团结了人民，帮助政府把抗战引导到光荣的胜利”。
    他继续说，第二届国会必须是一个为在北越建设社会主义而工作的国会。在未来的国会中，必须有称职的代表——全心全意为祖国、为人民、为社会主义服务的代表。选择这些代表是每一个选民的权利，也是义务。
    胡志明接着号召河内人民在选举后展开增产节约竞赛，以便完成1960年计划和准备实行第一个五年计划。
    他说，在越南劳动党的领导下，越南人民一定会取得在越南北方建设社会主义的胜利和争取国家重新统一的胜利。

    号召书号召人民慎重地选择那些德才兼备、最能代表全国人民意志的人作第二届国会代表。
    号召书说，第二届国会将继承第一届国会的事业，一定能完成动员全国人民建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南的光辉任务，并为巩固东南亚和世界的和平作出贡献。
    新华社河内电　越南通讯社报道，据初步数字，越南北方共有四百五十八名候选人参加将于5月8日举行的越南民主共和国第二届国会选举。这次选举将选出三百六十二名代表。
