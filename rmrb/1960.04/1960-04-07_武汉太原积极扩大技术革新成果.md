Wuhan

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, the vast number of workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Wuhan are advancing victoriously, striving to push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new, deeper, broader, and more advanced stage, and to rapidly catch up with the national advanced level in terms of labor productivity and product variety, specifications, and quality.

Mechanical and Semi-Mechanical Level Increased by 23.81% in Two Months

In the past two months or so, workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Wuhan have proposed more than 410,000 technical innovation suggestions of various kinds, of which more than 130,000 have been realized; the number of problems solved in production and technology is more than the total of the past two years. The level of mechanization and semi-mechanization (including automation and semi-automation) has increased from 38.29% before the movement to 62.1%. More than 30,500 people have been freed from manual labor and heavy physical labor, greatly improving working conditions. Labor efficiency has increased by multiples, even tenfold, and the appearance of enterprises has greatly changed. The city's total industrial output value plan for the first quarter was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, about one and a half times higher than the same period last year. The output plan of major products has also been overfulfilled, and many first-class products belonging to the "high, large, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new" category have also been produced. According to incomplete statistics, there are already 143 factories in the city that "one factory is equivalent to several factories, increasing production and saving manpower," saving 35,200 laborers.

Because of the universal establishment of technical innovation brigades and technical innovation groups in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the city's working-class technical team has rapidly grown and expanded. This organization is composed of leading cadres, workers, and technicians. It further organizes and systematizes the practice of the "three-way combination" of cadres, workers, and technicians. It combines the professional team of technical innovation with mass movements, and combines the technical innovation movement with mass scientific research and high-speed training of technical personnel. At present, there are 1,568 such organizations in the city, each with the following characteristics: both a renovation commando, a scientific research institution, and a red and expert school. Through this organizational form, technical forces have been rapidly cultivated, technical levels have been improved, a batch of cutting-edge science and technology such as long-distance control and program control have been conquered, and thousands of new products have been trial-produced.

New Equipment Forms Complete Sets, Increases Production, and Saves Raw Materials

In order to further deepen and perpetuate the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and seize a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the second quarter, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed party committees at all levels to organize and lead the masses to boldly launch movements, seriously summarize the experience of the previous stage, and call on the city's industrial and transportation front workers to advance victoriously, further establish lofty ambitions, and strive to catch up with the national advanced level in terms of labor productivity, product variety, specifications, and quality.

Based on the past experience, the Municipal Party Committee proposed that in the development of the movement to a higher stage, six important links must be grasped: First, further vigorously grasp the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement, further organize new equipment into complete sets and put them into production, and continuously improve and consolidate them; Second, expand and improve existing products and actively produce new products; Third, vigorously grasp the production of raw materials, vigorously carry out the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, waste utilization, and savings; Fourth, vigorously train technical teams, cultivate the working class's knowledge team, and further develop and consolidate technical innovation teams to become mass scientific and technological research teams and red and expert schools; Fifth, grasp production, ideology, life, learning, and hygiene together, and combine work and rest; Sixth, implement the policy of the whole people running transportation and the whole people running electricity, so that transportation and power supply can keep up with the needs of production development.

Taiyuan

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan. In the wave of technical innovation and technical revolution in Taiyuan, where everyone is engaged in innovation and there are creations everywhere, the production technology of various industries and various types of work has undergone tremendous changes. According to statistics up to March 18, the city's mechanization and semi-mechanization level has increased from the original 42% to more than 60%, saving more than 44,000 laborers; workers' labor productivity has increased by 86.09%. A large number of high, precision, cutting-edge, and new products have been manufactured. Major technological innovations have also emerged in production management, technical management, financial management departments, as well as purchasing and testing departments in various industrial and mining enterprises.

Comprehensive Planning, Organizing Battles to Vigorously Attack Weak Links

Taiyuan's technical innovation and technical revolution movement was carried out under the comprehensive planning and vigorous organization of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. After the Municipal Party Committee made a comprehensive plan for technical innovation in December last year, it immediately organized three large-scale battles. The main target of the first battle was to mechanize heavy physical labor; the second was to vigorously conduct the matching of advanced experience according to industry and type of work, and to consolidate and expand the achievements of mechanization and semi-mechanization. After these two battles, 1,793 of the city's 2,714 types of work were mechanized and semi-mechanized. The city's forging mechanization level increased from 67% last year to more than 90%. The degree of mechanization of loading and unloading and handling rapidly increased from 5%-9% last year to 65%. In order to advance victoriously, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a third battle starting in March. The specific goal of this battle is to continue to focus on eliminating manual labor and heavy physical labor, while technically transforming old equipment, and units with the conditions should strive to achieve automation and semi-automation. This practice of comprehensive planning and phased combat not only ensures the continuous upsurge of the movement but also overcomes the imbalance of the movement.

Summarize and Promote Advanced Experience, Strengthen Ideological and Technical Education

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Taiyuan, as soon as technical innovation achievements appeared, they were summarized and promoted in a timely manner through large-scale practice and competition, so that new achievements were quickly popularized to the entire industry and entire type of work, becoming the property of the city. In the past three months, more than 80% of the city's employees have participated in practice and competition activities. Practice and competition activities are both a process of concentrating, analyzing, researching, and appraising innovation achievements, and systematizing and completing sporadic and scattered innovation experiences; and a process of rapidly promoting these experiences, enabling workers to master new technologies. In the past three months, more than 800 advanced machines, equipment, and operating experiences have been quickly mastered by workers in the same industry and same type of work after being matched.

In order to further consolidate and expand the achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently requested that all enterprises do the following: First, in terms of production management and technical management, summarize the experience of using new equipment and applying new operating methods, and after experimentation and appraisal, incorporate new processes and operating methods into regulations. At the same time, organize batch production of affirmed tools and equipment, so as to universally promote the latest and most advanced technical experience that is effective in various types of work and various industries. Second, strengthen ideological education for employees, so that they actively support new things and overcome habitual forces; at the same time, actively solve the problem of spare parts and components required for the maintenance and repair of new machinery. Third, strengthen employees' spare-time education so that employees can quickly master new technologies, so as to innovate one item and consolidate one item. Fourth, according to the new situation, constantly adjust labor organization and comprehensively promote the experience of joint operation of production workers and maintenance workers in the heavy machinery plant water press workshop.

    武汉太原积极扩大技术革新成果
    武汉
    据新华社武汉电　武汉市工业、交通战线广大职工正乘胜前进，为把技术革新和技术革命运动推向一个更深入、更广阔、更高级的新阶段，为在劳动生产率和产品品种、规格、质量方面迅速赶上全国先进水平而奋斗。
    机械化半机械化程度两个月提高23.81％
    两个多月来，武汉市工业、交通战线的职工共提出各种技术革新建议四十一万多件，已实现十三万多件；生产上、技术上解决的问题，比过去两年的总和还多。机械化半机械化（包括自动化、半自动化）程度，已经由运动开展前的38.29％提高到62.1％，有三万零五百多人摆脱了手工操作和笨重体力劳动，大大地改善了劳动条件，劳动效率成倍、成十倍地提高，企业面貌大大改观。第一季度全市工业总产值计划早就提前超额完成，比去年同期约提高一倍半。主要产品产量计划也大都超额完成，还生产了不少属于“高大精尖新”的一流产品。据不完全统计，全市出现的“一厂顶数厂、增产又省人”的工厂已有一百四十三个，节约出的劳动力达三万五千二百人。
    由于在技术革新和技术革命运动中普遍地建立了技术革新大队和技术革新小组，全市工人阶级的技术队伍迅速地成长壮大起来。这种组织是由领导干部、工人和技术人员共同参加组成的。它使干部、工人、技术人员三结合的作法进一步组织化、制度化，使技术革新的专业队伍同大搞群众运动结合起来，技术革新运动同群众性的科学研究和高速度培养技术人材结合起来。目前，全市已有这种组织一千五百六十八个，每个组织都具有如下特征：既是革新突击队，又是科学研究机构和红专学校。通过这一组织形式迅速地培养了技术力量，提高了技术水平，已经攻下了远距离控制、程序控制等一批尖端科学技术，试制出上千种新产品。
    新设备成龙配套增产节约原材料
    为了把技术革新和技术革命运动进一步深入、持久地开展下去，夺取第二季度更大更好更全面的跃进，中共武汉市委指示各级党委有组织、有领导地放手发动群众，认真总结前一阶段的经验，号召全市工业、交通战线职工乘胜前进，进一步树雄心，立大志，力争在劳动生产率、产品品种、规格、质量方面赶上全国先进水平。
    根据过去一段经验，市委提出在运动向更高阶段发展中，必须抓好六个重要环节：第一，进一步大抓机械化半机械化运动，进一步组织新设备成龙配套投入生产，并不断改进和巩固；第二，要扩大提高现有的产品，积极生产新产品；第三，大抓原料材料生产，大搞原料材料的综合利用、废物利用和节约；第四，大力培养技术队伍，培养工人阶级的知识队伍，技术革新大队要进一步发展和巩固，使之成为群众性的科学技术研究队伍、红专学校；第五，生产、思想、生活、学习、卫生一齐抓，做到劳逸结合；第六，贯彻全民办交通，全民办电的方针，使交通运输、电力供应能跟上生产发展需要。
    太原
    据新华社太原电　太原市在人人闹革新、处处有创造的技术革新和技术革命浪潮中，各行业、各工种的生产技术面貌发生了巨大变化。据到3月18日的统计，全市机械化半机械化程度，已由原来的42％提高到60％以上，节省出四万四千多劳动力；工人的劳动生产率提高了86.09％。制造出大量的高、精、尖、新产品。各工矿企业在生产管理、技术管理、财务管理部门，以及采购、试验等部门，也都出现了重大的技术革新。
    全面规划　组织战役猛攻薄弱环节
    太原市的技术革新和技术革命运动是在中共太原市委全面规划、大力组织下进行的。去年12月，市委作出技术革新全面规划以后，紧跟着组织了三次大规模的战役。第一次战役的主攻目标是使笨重体力劳动机械化；第二次是按行业、工种大力进行先进经验配套，巩固和扩大机械化半机械化成果。经过这两个战役，全市二千七百一十四个工种有一千七百九十三个实现了机械化半机械化。全市锻造机械化水平由去年的67％提高到90％以上。装卸搬运的机械化程度迅速由去年的5％—9％激增到65％。为了乘胜前进，中共太原市委从3月份起又组织了第三次战役。这一战役的具体目标是继续在以消灭手工操作和笨重体力劳动为重点的同时，对旧设备进行技术改造，有条件的单位努力实现自动化半自动化。这种全面规划、分段作战的做法既保证了运动的不断高涨，又克服了运动的不平衡现象。
    总结和推广先进经验加强思想和技术教育
    太原市在技术革新和技术革命运动中，一出现技术革新成就，就通过大练武、大比武的方式及时总结和推广，使新成就迅速普及到全行业、全工种，变成全市的财产。最近三个月中，全市80％以上的职工参加了练武、比武活动。练武、比武活动，既是集中、分析、研究、鉴定革新成就，使零星的、分散的革新经验系统化、完整化的过程；又是迅速推广这些经验，使工人掌握新技术的过程。三个多月中，有八百多项先进机具、设备和操作经验经过配套，迅速被同行业、同工种的工人所掌握。
    为进一步巩固、扩大技术革新和技术革命运动的成果，中共太原市委最近要求各企业做好以下工作：第一、在生产管理和技术管理方面，总结使用新的设备和运用新的操作方法的经验，经过试验和鉴定，把新的工艺和操作方法纳入规程，同时，将肯定下来的工具、设备，组织成批生产，以便使行之有效的最新、最先进的技术经验，在各工种、各行业中普遍推广。第二、加强对职工的思想教育，使他们积极支持新生事物，战胜习惯势力；同时积极解决新机具的维护、检修所需要的备品备件问题。第三、加强职工的业余教育，使职工群众迅速掌握新技术，以做到革新一件，巩固一件。第四、根据新情况，不断调整劳动组织，全面推广重型机器厂水压机车间生产工人和检修工人联合作业的经验。
