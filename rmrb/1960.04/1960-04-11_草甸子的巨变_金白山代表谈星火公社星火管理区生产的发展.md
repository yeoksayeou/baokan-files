Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I will resolutely implement them in my work. Now, I will report to you on the situation in our management area.

	Expanded Cultivated Area and Developed Diversified Economy

The Xinghuo Management Area of the Xinghuo People's Commune in Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, was a meadow in 1948. At the time of liberation, several Korean families migrated here from various places. They had nothing - no houses, no draught animals, no farm tools - and lived in extreme poverty. After liberation, our lives have improved day by day. In the past few years, like our other fraternal nationalities, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the radiant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, and with the enthusiastic help of all fraternal nationalities, especially the Han elders, all commune members have worked diligently and selflessly, enabling production to develop rapidly. In particular, after the establishment of the People's Commune, its enormous advantages have been brought into play. Expanding the cultivated area, developing a diversified economy, and further implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" have greatly promoted the development of production. With the development of production, public accumulation has also continued to grow. The current total output value has reached more than 280,000 yuan, including 31 horses and 70 head of cattle for production materials. We have established livestock farms, rice mills, iron factories, small repair shops, rope factories, and hatcheries. There are also seven electric motors, two large threshing machines, three winnowing machines, ten rubber-tired carts, twenty-seven iron-wheeled carts, a set of track tools, a set of fishing tools, and other various new-style farm tools, as well as 150 public buildings and a two-story building of 160 square meters.

	Changed People's Spiritual Outlook

With the development of production and the growth of public accumulation, the material and cultural lives of the commune members and various welfare undertakings have also greatly developed. Our management area has a clinic, a primary school, a nursery, a home for the elderly, and a broadcasting station. Every household has a radio speaker, every family has electric lights, every house has a well, and 80% of the commune members live a prosperous life. 90% of the young people have eliminated illiteracy, and junior high school education has been basically universalized. In addition, in order to enliven the cultural life of the commune members, we have also formed an amateur cultural troupe of more than 30 people, which regularly performs various literary and artistic programs. Due to the development of production and the improvement of material and cultural life, the spiritual outlook of the people has also greatly changed. A good atmosphere has been formed in which everyone loves labor, everyone loves learning, everyone talks about politics, everyone cherishes public property, and everyone talks about socialism and communism. All this should be attributed to the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the help of all fraternal nationalities.

In order to expand production and accelerate socialist construction, according to the slogan put forward by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China: Strive to realize agricultural mechanization in the next five years. Combined with the situation in our management area, in 1958, we actively and massively launched a movement to improve agricultural machinery, tools, and technological innovation, centered on agricultural mechanization. In the technological innovation movement, we resolutely implemented a series of policies of walking on two legs, such as combining mechanized field operations with non-field operations, combining modern technology with existing excellent experience, combining "machines, horses, and cattle," combining mechanization with improved farm tools, and combining large, medium, and small machines. In the technological revolution movement, the broad masses of commune members displayed the creative spirit of daring to think and daring to act. Therefore, in a very short period of time, technological innovation achieved great results. Twelve new types of farm tools, such as large threshing machines, human-pulled seeders, granular fertilizer machines, awn removers, and high-blowing winnowing machines, have been created, and some farm tools have been improved. After these machines are modified, the general efficiency is increased by two to three times, and some are increased by more than ten times (such as the high-blowing winnowing machine, which costs less than 100 yuan and can winnow 180,000 jin of rice per day, which is twelve times higher than the original machine). Because the improved farm tools improved work efficiency, a large amount of labor was saved. According to statistics, 14,000 workdays were saved in 1959, accounting for 20% of the total number of workdays. This not only solved the difficulty of labor shortage, but also freed up some labor to support national industrial construction.

	Everyone Engages in Technological Innovation

Our management area did not go smoothly when carrying out the technological revolution movement. We encountered some wrong ideas. At the same time, there were many practical difficulties, such as insufficient raw materials and lack of experience. However, under the leadership of the Party Committee, we insisted on putting politics in command, fully mobilized the masses, and offered suggestions and plans, quickly setting off a high tide of technological revolution. The specific methods are as follows:

1.  Put politics in command, rely on the masses, and continuously carry out education on the struggle between the two roads and the two ideologies. In the development of the movement to improve farm tools, tools, and technological innovation, some ideological obstacles were also encountered. For example, some people were afraid that they would not be able to create, and the masses would have opinions; they were afraid of wasting manpower and financial resources and affecting production; they were also afraid that the labor force would not be enough to complete it; the time was not enough to be in time; there were not enough raw materials to stop work and wait for materials, and so on. In response to these ideas, the Party branch conducted education, criticized right-leaning conservative ideas, and improved understanding. If there were insufficient raw materials, the masses were mobilized to offer suggestions and plans to tap potential; if there was insufficient time, they fought day and night for several days. In this way, the agricultural technological revolution movement in our management area quickly developed. For example, in the spring of 1958, there was a lot of rain, and neither cattle plows nor tractors could plow the land. In this case, under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Commune, the Party branch mobilized the masses to pool their wisdom and ideas. Cadres and technicians, tractor drivers jointly studied, and worked hard for three days and nights, and finally created success. On two tractors, the wooden tracks were widened by 20 centimeters, and the wheels of the five-share plow were changed to sledges, so that the tractor insisted on carrying out machine plowing in the paddy field, and completed the spring sowing task 15 days in advance. Broke the routine that mechanical plowing could not be used in paddy fields. Another example is that during the tense period of threshing last year, iron and wood workers were mobilized to work hard day and night, and large threshing machines and high-blowing winnowing machines were made, which improved work efficiency several times. The masses named the high-blowing winnowing machine "Rocket-style Winnowing Machine". In the past two years, more and more people in our management area have participated in tool reform, offered suggestions, and made rationalization proposals, and a situation of everyone engaging in technological innovation has emerged.

2.  In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the policy of walking on two legs was implemented. We have adopted methods such as combining mechanization with natural transformation, combining mechanization with agricultural technology, combining mechanization with tool reform, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining machines with animal power, giving full play to the efficiency of machinery. For example, in terms of transforming nature to adapt to mechanical operations, we focused on water conservancy infrastructure construction centered on field drainage. 280,000 meters of earthwork (56 li) were excavated, and the standardization of the irrigation and drainage system was fully realized. At the same time, depressions were filled in, so that the groundwater level was lowered to the minimum limit, and the fields were dried in time, creating favorable conditions for mechanical operations, and quickly realizing mechanized operations such as paddy field plowing, suppression, leveling, and sowing.

3.  Improve the organization and strengthen leadership. In order to continuously improve and develop the movement of tool reform and agricultural technological innovation, the cadres of the management area personally participated in the formation of a tool reform research group with iron and wood craftsmen as the backbone and absorbing people with special skills; the production team leader was the main backbone of the old farmers and absorbed experienced people to participate in the agricultural technology research group. Regularly study, discuss and summarize the experience of tool reform and agricultural technological innovation movement, and organize exchanges and promotion to guide the movement to move forward continuously. And adopt the method of six combinations in the movement. That is: technical cadres and the masses are combined, daring to think and doing are combined, individual initiatives and collective research are combined, experimentation and continuous improvement are combined, old and new styles are combined, indigenous and foreign styles are combined; and timely commend the advanced and help the backward, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses for tool reform and agricultural technological innovation. At the same time, technical talents were also trained and cultivated in the movement, and 25 tractor drivers, technicians, iron and wood workers were trained; 12 agricultural technicians were trained, thus strengthening the technical force.

4.  Engage in large-scale cooperation and mutual exchange of what is needed. Cooperation between management areas solved the problem of shortage of materials, technology, and tools. For example, our repair shop does not have large lathes and electric saws, and some parts cannot be repaired, so we look for the Hongqi Management Area for cooperation; the Hongqi Management Area does not have welding machines, so we lend them the welding machines. In this way, mutual cooperation solved their own difficulties and successfully completed the tool reform task.

5.  In terms of agricultural technological innovation, the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" has been conscientiously implemented in recent years. Our cultivated paddy fields have been deep-plowed in autumn, with 348 hectares of deep-plowed land (accounting for 73% of the total cultivated area); all have realized improved varieties, and at the same time, the method of variety hybridization has been adopted, and more than 20 new varieties have been cultivated. Attention has also been paid to the improvement of technology in field management.

Although we have achieved great results in the technological revolution movement, we are still far behind the new situation. In particular, there are fewer mechanized projects, and the quality is very low, which cannot keep up with the needs of agricultural development. Therefore, according to the spirit of this conference, we will hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, muster greater efforts, actively create conditions, and strive to achieve an all-round great leap forward and great harvest with grain as the key link.

    草甸子的巨变
    金白山代表谈星火公社星火管理区生产的发展主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护富春、先念两位副总理所作的报告，并在工作中坚决贯彻执行。现将我们管理区的情况向各位代表作一汇报。	扩大了耕地面积，发展了多种经营
    黑龙江省佳木斯市星火人民公社星火管理区，1948年还是一片草甸子，解放当时由各地迁来几户朝鲜族居民。房屋、耕畜、农具等一无所有，生活极为贫困。解放后，我们的生活一天天的好起来了。几年来，我们和其他兄弟民族一样，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在各兄弟民族特别是汉族老大哥的热情帮助下，全体社员辛勤忘我劳动，使生产得到了迅速的发展。特别是人民公社成立后，发挥了它巨大的优越性。扩大了耕地面积，发展了多种经营，进一步贯彻“农业八字宪法”，这就大大的促进了生产的发展。随着生产的发展公共积累也不断增长。现在总产值已达二十八万多元，其中生产资料有马三十一匹、役牛七十头，建立了畜牧场、制米厂、铁工厂、小型修配厂、制绳厂、孵卵厂，还有电动机七台、大型脱谷机二台、扬场机三台、胶轮车十台、铁轮车二十七台、轨道化工具一套、捕渔工具一套等其他各种新式农具，还有各种用途的公共建筑房屋一百五十间、一百六十平方公尺的二层楼房一栋。	  改变了人们的精神面貌
    随着生产的发展和公共积累的增长，社员的物质文化生活和各项福利事业，也有很大发展。我们管理区设有卫生所、小学校、托儿所、敬老院、广播站各一处。户户有广播喇叭，家家有电灯，每栋房有一个洋井，有80％的社员过着富裕的生活。有90％的青年扫除了文盲，基本上实现了中学普及教育。此外，为了活跃社员们的文化生活，我们还组成三十余人的业余文工团，经常演出各种文艺节目。由于生产的发展，物质文化生活的提高，人们的精神面貌也大大改变，已形成人人爱劳动、人人爱学习、人人讲政治、人人爱护公共财产、人人大谈社会主义和共产主义的良好风气。所有这些都应归功于党和毛主席的英明正确的领导和各兄弟民族对我们的帮助。
    为了扩大生产，加速社会主义建设，根据中共黑龙江省委提出：争取在今后五年内实现农业机械化的口号，结合我们管理区的情况，于1958年先后积极地、大规模地开展了以农业机械化为中心的改良农具、工具和技术革新运动。在技术革新运动中，坚决贯彻了田间机械化作业和非田间作业机械化相结合，现代技术和原有的优良经验相结合，“机马牛”相结合、机械化与改良农具相结合、大中小机器相结合等一系列两条腿走路的方针。在技术革命运动中，广大社员发挥了敢想敢干的创造精神。因此，在很短的时间内技术革新就取得了很大成绩。创造出大型脱谷机、人拉播种机、颗粒肥料机、脱芒机、高吹扬场机等十二种新式农具，并改进了一些农具。这些机器改装后一般的都提高工作效率二至三倍，有的提高到十倍以上（如高吹扬场机成本不到一百元，每天能扬出十八万斤稻子，比原来的机器提高十二倍）。由于改良农具提高了工作效率，就节省了大量的劳动力，据统计1959年节省一万四千个工日，占总工数20％。这不仅解决了劳动力不足的困难，而且还抽出一些劳动力支援国家工业建设。	    人人都闹技术革新
    我们管理区在开展技术革命运动时，并不是一帆风顺的，曾遇到一些错误思想。同时也有不少实际困难，如原料不足，缺乏经验等。但是在党委的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，献计献策，很快的就掀起大闹技术革命高潮。具体作法有如下几点：
    一、政治挂帅，依靠群众，不断进行两条道路和两种思想斗争的教育。在开展改良农具、工具和技术革新运动中也遭到一些思想障碍，如有的人怕创造不成，群众有意见；怕浪费人力财力，影响生产；又怕劳力不足搞不成；时间不足来不及；原材料不足停工待料等等。党支部针对这些思想，进行教育，批判了右倾保守思想，提高了认识。原材料不足，发动群众献计献策，挖潜力；时间不足，昼夜突击连战几天。这样，我们管理区的农业技术革命运动很快的开展起来了。如1958年春雨水多，牛犁和拖拉机都不能翻地，在这种情况下，党支部在公社党委的领导下，发动群众集思广益，干部和技术员，拖拉机手共同研究，苦战三昼夜，终于创造成功了，在两台拖拉机上，用木头加宽链轨二十公分，并把五铧犁轮子改为爬犁的方法，使拖拉机在水田坚持进行机翻，提前了十五天完成了春播任务。打破了水田不能使用机械翻地的常规。另如在去年脱谷紧张时期，发动铁、木工连夜苦战，制成了大型脱谷机和高吹扬场机，都提高工效好几倍。群众给高吹扬场机命名“火箭式扬场机”。两年来，我们管理区参加工具改革，献计、提合理化建议的人数越来越多，出现了人人大闹技术革新的局面。
    二、在技术革新和技术革命运动中，贯彻执行了两条腿走路的方针。我们采取了机械化与改造自然相结合，机械化与农业技术相结合，机械化与改革工具相结合，土与洋相结合，机器与畜力相结合等方法，充分的发挥了机械的效能。如在改造自然适应于机械作业的方面，我们着重抓住了田间排水为中心的水利基本建设。挖出二十八万米土方（五十六华里），全面的实现了灌、排系统标准化，同时填平洼地，使地下水位下降到最低限度，田地得到及时干燥，给机械作业创造了有利条件，很快的实现了水田翻地、镇压、捞平、播种等机械化作业。
    三、健全组织，加强领导。为使工具改革和农业技术革新运动不断提高和发展，由管理区干部亲自参加以铁、木巧匠为骨干吸收有特长的人组成工具改革研究组；以生产队长为主老农为骨干吸收有经验的人参加组成农业技术研究组。经常研究讨论和总结工具改革和农业技术革新运动的经验，并组织交流推广，指导运动不断向前发展。并在运动中采取六结合的方法。即：技术干部和群众相结合，敢想和实干相结合，个人倡议和集体研究相结合，试验和不断改进相结合，旧式和新式相结合，土、洋相结合；并及时表扬先进，帮助落后，这样就大大激发了群众对工具改革和农业技术革新的积极性和创造性。同时在运动中也锻炼和培养了技术人材，培养出拖拉机手、技术员、铁、木工二十五名；农业技术员十二名，从而加强了技术力量。
    四、大搞协作，互通有无。管理区之间进行协作，解决了物资、技术、工具的不足问题。如我们修配厂没有大型车床和电锯，有些部件修不了，我们就找红旗管理区协作；红旗管理区没有电焊机，我们就把电焊机借给他们用。这样互相协作，都解决了自己的困难，顺利的完成了工具改革任务。
    五、在农业技术革新方面，几年来认真贯彻执行了“农业八字宪法”。我们耕种的水田已作到秋翻深翻，深翻地三百四十八垧（占总耕地面积73％）；全部实现了良种化，同时采用品种杂交的方法，已培育出二十来种新品种。田间管理方面也注意了技术的改进。
    我们在技术革命运动中虽然取得了很大成绩，但是，还远远落在新形势的后面，特别机械化项目较少，质量也很低，还不能跟上农业大发展的需要。因此，我们根据这次大会的精神，高举毛泽东思想红旗，鼓足更大干劲，积极创造条件，为实现以粮为纲的全面大跃进、大丰收而奋斗。
