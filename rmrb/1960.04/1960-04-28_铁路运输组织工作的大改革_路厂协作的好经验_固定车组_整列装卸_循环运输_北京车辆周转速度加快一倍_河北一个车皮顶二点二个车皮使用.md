A major reform of railway transport organization; Good experience in cooperation between railway and factory.
Fixed Train Sets, Whole-Train Loading and Unloading, Circular Transportation.
Beijing Vehicle Turnover Rate Doubles; Hebei Uses One Wagon as 2.2.

(Our report) Beijing Railway Department and factory enterprise workers have jointly created a "fixed train set, whole-train loading and unloading, circular transportation" method, which shortens the station operation time of vehicles by half and accelerates the vehicle turnover rate by one time.

The "fixed train set, whole-train loading and unloading, circular transportation" method is to fix a batch of locomotives, vehicles, and crew members within a certain section to transport goods back and forth in a circular manner. These vehicles do not need to go through routine operations such as marshalling and dismantling, except for whole-train loading and unloading within stations and industrial and mining enterprises.

When universally promoting fixed train sets and circular transportation, under the unified leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Railway Department and industrial and mining enterprises unified the vehicles used by the railway department and the self-provided vehicles of industrial and mining enterprises, forming sixteen sets of fixed train sets. These were jointly managed by the Beijing Railway Office and eleven units with large transportation volumes, such as the Jingxi Mining Bureau, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Coking Chemical Plant, and Beijing Building Materials Industry Bureau, who were jointly responsible for transporting large quantities of goods such as coal, coke, limestone, and building materials. In this way, production, transportation, and sales are mutually promoted and closely linked, giving full play to the enthusiasm of local areas and enterprises.

These units implemented package deals including tasks, sources of goods, transport capacity, efficiency, and operational safety, unifying thinking, plans, and competition evaluations. The goods to be shipped are arranged according to the priority, volume, and flow direction, with unified monthly, ten-day, and daily transportation plans. On this basis, the "six fixed" transportation method of fixed train sets, fixed locomotives, fixed crew members, fixed sources of goods, fixed operation lines, and fixed loading and unloading operation times was implemented, fully tapping the potential of the equipment. Fixed train sets and circular transportation have three major benefits: First, they accelerate vehicle turnover. According to statistics, in the past, each vehicle could only perform one loading and unloading operation per day; now, it can load three times and unload three times, with a maximum of loading eight times and unloading seven times. Second, because these vehicles do not need to go through operations such as collection, marshalling, and dismantling, the tension in marshalling stations is alleviated, and the phenomenon of backlog of vehicles is reduced. Third, fixed train sets are fixed according to the different types of vehicles applicable to different goods, so the load capacity of freight cars can be increased.

Xinhua News Agency Tianjin Electric Report: Employees of the Hebei Province Railway Transportation Department reformed the railway transportation organization and implemented the joint operation method of "Field Army" and "Local Army" – "Fixed Wagon Bottom" transportation, fully tapping the potential of railway transportation. From March 1st to now, the province has fixed 27.3 sets of trains, achieving the use of one wagon as 2.2.

The main content of this reform is: the vehicles controlled by the central government are the "Field Army", responsible for inter-provincial transportation; the province distributes the wagons allocated to the local area by the central government to the provincial and regional railway offices and special (city) levels for control, forming a "Local Army", responsible for the transportation of major materials within the province, across regions, and within regions; the trains (i.e., wagon bottoms) controlled at all levels implement fixed sources of goods, ensure whole-train loading and unloading, fix the train, do not disassemble or dismantle it, fix the operation process, and fix the transportation section. In this way, under the unified leadership of the party committees at all levels, the production enterprises, transportation departments, and receiving units form a "three-in-one" whole from the general cooperative relationship.

After the implementation of "fixed wagon bottom" transportation, the cumbersome technical operation processes in railway transportation were greatly simplified, and the vehicle turnaround time was shortened. In the past, each operation time of a group of trains had to go through nine operation processes: loading, running, arriving at the terminal station, dismantling, sending to special lines, unloading, taking empty vehicles, and marshalling. Most of the turnaround time of locomotives and vehicles was spent on waiting for marshalling, dismantling, picking up and sending vehicles, and waiting for loading and unloading. After the implementation of "fixed wagon bottom" transportation, because the transported materials are the same consignee, the same variety, whole loading and unloading, the train is loaded on the special line of the production enterprise, without stopping at the marshalling station or section station, and directly sent to the unloading special line of the receiving unit. This simplifies the technical operation process of a train's operation time from the past nine steps to three steps of loading, transporting, and unloading.

    铁路运输组织工作的大改革　路厂协作的好经验
    固定车组　整列装卸　循环运输
    北京车辆周转速度加快一倍　河北一个车皮顶二点二个车皮使用
    本报讯　北京铁路部门和工厂企业的职工，共同创造了“固定车组、整列装卸、循环运输”的运输方法，使车辆在车站的停站作业时间缩短一半，车辆的周转速度加快一倍。
    “固定车组、整列装卸、循环运输”的方法，就是在一定的区间内，固定一批机车、车辆和乘务组，往复循环地运送货物。这些车辆除了在车站和工矿企业内部进行整列装车和卸车外，不需经过编组、解体等例行的作业过程。
    在普遍推行固定车组、循环运输时，北京铁路部门和工矿企业在中共北京市委统一领导下，把铁路部门的运用车辆和工矿企业的自备车辆统一组织起来，编成十六套固定车组，由北京铁路办事处和京西矿务局、石景山钢铁公司、北京市炼焦化学厂、北京市建筑材料工业局等十一个运量较大的单位共同管理，统一负责，专门运输煤炭、焦炭、灰石和建筑材料等大量货物。这样，就使产运销三个方面，做到了互相促进、环环紧扣，充分发挥了地方和企业的积极性。
    这些单位实行了包任务、包货源、包运力、包效率、包作业安全，统一思想、统一计划、统一竞赛评比。需要托运的货物，按照轻重缓急、流量流向、统一安排月度、旬间和每天的运输计划。在这个基础上，又实行了固定车组、固定机车、固定乘务组、固定货源、固定运行线、固定装卸作业时间的“六固定”运输方法，充分挖掘了设备的潜力。固定车组、循环运输有三大好处：一、加快了车辆周转。据统计，以往每个车辆每天只能进行一次装卸作业；现在可以装三次、卸三次，最高达到装八次、卸七次。二、因为这些车辆不需要经过集结、编组、解体等作业过程，缓和了编组站的紧张状况，减少了积压车辆的现象。三、固定车组是按不同的货物来固定适用的不同类型的车辆，因此能提高货车的载重量。
    据新华社天津电　河北省铁路运输部门的职工改革铁路运输组织工作，实行“野战军”和“地方军”联合作战方法——“固定车底”运输，充分挖掘了铁路运输潜力。从3月1日到现在，全省已固定了二十七点三套列车，达到了一个车皮顶二点二个车皮使用。
    这一改革的主要内容是：中央掌握的车辆为“野战军”，负责跨省运输；省里将中央拨给地方的车皮分别由省、地区铁路办事处和专（市）分级掌握，组成“地方军”，负责省内、跨区和地区内的主要物资运输；各级掌管的列车（即车底），实行固定货源，保证列车整装整卸，固定列车，不拆散不解体，固定作业过程，固定运输区段。这样，在各级党委统一领导下，使生产企业、运输部门和收货单位，由一般的协作关系组成一个“三合一”的整体。
    实行“固定车底”运输以后，大大简化了铁路运输中繁琐的技术作业过程，缩短了车辆中转时间。在过去，每一组列车的一次作业时间，必须经过装车、运行和到过终点站、解体、送专用线、卸车、取空车、编组等九个作业过程，机车车辆周转的大部分时间花费在等待编组、解体、取送车和待装、待卸等“六待”上。实行“固定车底”运输以后，由于运输的物资是同一收货人，同一品种、整装整卸，列车从生产企业的专用线装上车以后，不用在编组站、区段站停留，便直接送到收货单位的卸车专用线，这就使列车的一次作业时间的技术作业过程由过去的九道，简化成装、运、卸三道。
