    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd: Seoul dispatch: In Incheon, South Korea, this morning, 3,000 students, defying the bloody suppression by the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique, held demonstrations and marches against the fascist rule of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique. This marks the fifth consecutive day of demonstrations against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique by the people of this important South Korean port.

    The students chanted "Syngman Rhee government get out!" "Arrest the persons responsible for the Masan massacre!" They also protested the fraudulent election held by Syngman Rhee on March 15th, demanding the resignation of Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-poong, who was "elected" as "Vice President" this time.

    Angry demonstrators were forced to attack the Incheon City Party Headquarters of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party with stones.

    The students also protested against the Syngman Rhee group's order for the police to fire on demonstrators in Seoul and other cities, shouting "Don't the police have their own brothers, sisters, and children?"

    After four hours of demonstrations, the students gathered in front of the City Hall and read out a statement against Syngman Rhee's criminal rule.

    Yesterday, in Gunsan Port, south of Seoul, 1,000 students also held demonstrations against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique. Defying the obstruction of armed police, they shouted slogans such as "The government must be held responsible for the killing of students."

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 22nd: Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, said today in a telegram to the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions that the World Federation of Trade Unions firmly supports the struggle of workers and people of all strata in South Korea against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee.

    The telegram said that the suffering of the South Korean people is mainly due to the policy of intervention by U.S. imperialism. The telegram pointed out that the interventionist policy of U.S. imperialism continues to create division in Korea and has turned South Korea into a military base for U.S. expansion abroad.

    The telegram emphasized that the World Federation of Trade Unions is convinced that the heroic actions of the Korean people will ultimately be victorious. A democratic regime will replace the current fascist regime in South Korea. The reunification of Korea will become a reality.

    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: According to TASS, New York, 22nd: Gus Hall, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, issued a statement to the press on the struggle of the South Korean people against U.S.-Syngman Rhee rule.

    The statement said that the U.S. State Department's belated and hypocritical "condemnation" of the "repressive measures, unsuitable for a free democratic country," taken by the Syngman Rhee government "cannot cover up the U.S. responsibility for the brutal repression of the South Korean people."

    The statement said, "When has South Korea ever been a 'free democratic country'? When has Syngman Rhee not employed 'repressive measures'?"

    The statement continued: "Syngman Rhee was put in power by the U.S. military. He has maintained his rule entirely through deceptive elections, gangsterism, massacres, and the military, including the U.S. military." The statement pointed out that on April 19th, the so-called "United Nations Command" stationed in South Korea even had one of its divisions of South Korean troops participate in the suppression of the people.

    The statement pointed out that the South Korean people have now begun an open struggle against hunger, poverty, military occupation, and exploitation.

    The statement said: "The South Korean people have seen the achievements made by their brothers and sisters in North Korea. After freeing themselves from imperialist exploitation, North Korea is advancing rapidly. News of this great progress cannot but be known to the impoverished and oppressed people of South Korea."

    The statement concluded, "The struggle of the South Korean people will continue. American workers should give their full support, first and foremost by demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. troops disguised under the transparent guise of the United Nations forces. Take the weapons of the United States from the hands of Syngman Rhee's executioners. Let the South Korean people decide their own future."

    南朝鲜仁川人民再接再厉继续示威
    世界工联和美国共产党表示支持南朝鲜人民斗争
    新华社平壤23日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜仁川市今天上午又有三千名学生不顾美李集团的血腥镇压，举行示威游行，反对美李集团的法西斯统治。这是这个南朝鲜重要港口的人民连续第五天举行反对美李集团的示威。
    学生们高呼“李承晚政府滚蛋！”“逮捕对马山屠杀事件的负责人！”他们并且抗议李承晚在3月15日举行的欺骗选举，要求李承晚和这次当选的“副总统”李起鹏辞职。
    愤怒的示威者被迫用石头袭击李承晚的自由党仁川市党部。
    学生们还抗议李承晚集团命令警察在汉城和其他城市向示威者开枪，并且高呼“难道警察就没有自己的兄弟、姐妹和儿女吗？”
    经过四个小时的示威以后，学生们聚集在市政厅前面，宣读了反对李承晚罪恶统治的声明。
    昨天，在汉城南面的群山港，一千名学生也举行了反对美李集团的示威。他们不顾武装警察的阻挡，高呼“政府必须对杀害学生事件负责”等口号。
    新华社布拉格22日电　世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬今天在给朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长的一份电报中说，世界工会联合会坚决支持南朝鲜的工人和不同阶层人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争。
    电报说，南朝鲜人民的苦难主要是由于美帝国主义干涉政策的结果。电报指出，美帝国主义的干涉政策仍然在制造朝鲜的分裂，并且把南朝鲜变为美国向外扩张的军事基地。
    电报强调指出，世界工会联合会深信，朝鲜人民的英勇行动将会最终取得胜利。一个民主的政权将会代替南朝鲜目前的法西斯政权。朝鲜的统一将会变成现实。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约22日讯：美国共产党总书记葛斯·霍尔就南朝鲜人民反对美李统治的斗争向报界发表声明。
    声明说，美国国务院对李承晚政府采取的“不适合于一个自由的民主国家的镇压措施”所作的迟迟而来的、伪善的“谴责”，“决不能掩盖美国对残酷镇压南朝鲜人民应负的责任。”
    声明说：“南朝鲜什么时候曾经是个‘自由的民主国家’呢？李承晚什么时候没有采用过‘镇压措施’呢？”
    声明接着说：“李承晚是由美国军队捧上台的。他是完全靠欺骗性的选举、匪徒行径、屠杀和军队，其中包括美国军队，来维持统治的。”声明指出，4月19日，驻在南朝鲜的所谓“联合国军司令部”还曾让它所辖的一师南朝鲜军队参加了对人民的镇压。
    声明指出，南朝鲜人民现在已经开始了反对饥饿、贫困，反对军事占领和剥削的公开斗争。
    声明说：“南朝鲜人民看到了他们在北朝鲜的兄弟姐妹们所取得的成就。在摆脱帝国主义的剥削以后，北朝鲜正在迅速前进。这种巨大进展的消息，是不可能不为遭受着贫困和受压迫的南朝鲜人民知道的。”
    声明最后说，“南朝鲜人民的斗争将继续下去。美国工人应该全力支持，首先是要求撤退打着人们一眼就可以识破的联合国军幌子的美国军队。把美国的武器从李承晚的刽子手手里拿走。让南朝鲜人民决定他们自己的前途。”
