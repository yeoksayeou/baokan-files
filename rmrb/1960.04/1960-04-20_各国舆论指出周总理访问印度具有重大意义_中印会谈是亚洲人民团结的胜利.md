Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today stating that Asian people welcome the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and regard this meeting as a victory for Sino-Indian friendly relations and the solidarity of Asian nations.

The editorial, titled "The Sino-Indian Border Issue Can Be Properly Resolved Based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," stated that if the Sino-Indian border issue can be properly resolved, it will be a significant contribution to the solidarity movement of Asian and African countries against imperialism and in defense of peace. Therefore, the people of Asia and all sincere people in the world are closely watching the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and hope that the meeting will be successful.

The editorial stated that during the period when British colonialists ruled India, they arbitrarily formulated the so-called McMahon Line to serve their colonialist purposes. Due to this action by Britain, a large area of Chinese territory was occupied. The editorial said that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government had stated that China would never recognize the so-called McMahon Line, and that there was an issue of an undefined border between China and India.

The editorial said: The Sino-Indian border issue is a legacy of colonialism. This is a complex issue, and therefore it is understandable that the Chinese and Indian governments have differences on this issue. However, compared to the interests of the Asian people's cause of unity and the long-standing friendly relations between China and India, these differences, no matter how large, are only partial and temporary. With concern for common interests, with an attitude of mutual understanding and tolerance, and especially with the sincerity of fully implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Chinese and Indian governments in 1954, the Sino-Indian border issue can certainly be properly resolved.

The editorial pointed out that colonialists are intensifying their insidious policies of alienating Asian nations. Asian nations must unite closely to oppose colonialism and imperialism, the fierce and cunning common enemies.

The editorial concluded by wishing success to the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru, and wishing that Sino-Indian relations and the unity of the Asian and African people will be increasingly consolidated and developed in a direction that is conducive to peace and the cause of liberation of the Asian and African nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th: The Czechoslovakian "Labor Daily" pointed out today in a commentary on Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to some Asian countries that the Sino-Indian border issue is very complex. It has never been demarcated, and the two sides have never signed a treaty. Today, there are considerable differences in views regarding the traditional boundary lines.

The commentary said that the difficulty in resolving the whole problem does not lie in its complexity, but in the fact that certain political figures in India are trying to use the differences to achieve their own goals. They hope that the friendship between India and China will be interrupted, that India will be dragged into military blocs, and that India's domestic policy will swing to the right. These groups have opposed the talks between the two Prime Ministers from the beginning. Therefore, the fact that the Prime Ministers of the two countries are about to hold talks should be regarded as a great victory for the cause of peace.

The commentary said that Premier Zhou Enlai expressed the hope that his visit would promote the strengthening of friendship between the two countries. This hope is justified, although the upcoming talks may not lead to an immediate resolution of the disputed issues. However, the decision by both sides to continue on the path of talks is of great significance. A meeting between the leaders of the two countries will achieve better results than exchanging diplomatic notes.

The commentary concluded by saying that the reactionary propaganda organs of the West have in the past and are now doing their best to exploit the dispute between the two major Asian countries. Now they are claiming that Zhou Enlai's visit will not be successful, and that there is no way to reach a consensus between India and the People's Republic of China. But Chinese comrades believe that if both sides have good intentions, a way will always be found.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 18th: The Cambodian "Friendship Newspaper" said in today's editorial that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, India, and Nepal is a true manifestation of the unity of the Asian and African people.

The editorial emphasized that Premier Zhou Enlai received a warm and cordial welcome from local residents in Rangoon, the capital of Burma.

The newspaper pointed out that imperialists are using the Sino-Indian border dispute to sabotage, and they have been clamoring that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the policy of neutrality of Asian-African solidarity have come to an end when the Sino-Indian border dispute occurred.

The newspaper said that in reality, the people of Asian and African countries are becoming increasingly aware, and the declaration of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will surely break the dreams of the imperialists.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 17th: The Iraqi "Opinion Newspaper" published an editorial today welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India.

The editorial said that China and India, these two countries were formerly under colonialist and reactionary rule, which even greatly hindered the two countries from demarcating geographical boundaries. This situation left each of the two countries with many problems with neighboring countries. The editorial continued by saying that when events occurred that required the determination of the true boundaries of the two countries, the imperialists intervened to instigate one country against another in order to create tension in Asia and use this situation to oppose the national movement and promote the imperialist plan against the Asian people. The editorial pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India this time is of the utmost importance. First, this visit will resolve the border issue in a way that satisfies both countries through direct negotiations; second, this visit will greatly help consolidate cooperation between these two major countries and strengthen relations between them, thereby forming a huge pillar of peace, security, and stability in Asia.

### 各国舆论指出周总理访问印度具有重大意义  中印会谈是亚洲人民团结的胜利

    各国舆论指出周总理访问印度具有重大意义
    中印会谈是亚洲人民团结的胜利
    新华社河内19日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论说，亚洲人民欢迎中印两国总理的会谈，并把这个会谈看成是中印友好关系和亚洲各民族团结的一个胜利。
  这篇题为“中印边界问题完全可以根据和平共处五项原则妥善地解决”的社论说，中印边界问题如果能够妥善地解决，对亚非各国反对帝国主义、保卫和平的团结运动将是一个具有重要意义的贡献。因此，亚洲人民和世界上一切有诚意的人们都密切地注视着中印两国总理的会谈，并希望这次会谈成功。
    社论说，在英国殖民者统治印度的时期，他们擅自制定了所谓麦克马洪线，以便为他们的殖民主义目的服务。由于英国这个行动，中国领土的一大块面积被侵占了。社论说，中华人民共和国成立以后，中国政府曾经声明中国永远不会承认所谓麦克马洪线，中国和印度之间存在着边界未划定的问题。
    社论说：中印边界问题是殖民主义的一个遗产。这是一个复杂的问题，因此，中国和印度两国政府对这个问题有分歧是不难理解的。但是，比起亚洲人民团结事业的利益、比起中印两国悠久的友好关系，这种分歧不管怎样大也只是局部的、暂时的。具有了对共同利益的关心，具有了互相了解和忍让的态度，特别是具有了对中印两国政府1954年所倡导的和平共处五项原则的充分贯彻执行的诚意，中印边界问题一定能够妥善地得到解决。
    社论指出，殖民主义者正在加紧采取的阴险的离间亚洲各民族的政策，亚洲各民族一定要紧密地团结起来，反对殖民主义、帝国主义这个凶恶和狡猾的共同敌人。
    社论最后预祝周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的会谈取得成功，祝中印关系和亚非人民的团结朝着有利于和平和亚非各民族的解放事业的方向日益巩固和发展。
    新华社布拉格17日电　捷克斯洛伐克“劳动报”今天在一篇关于周恩来总理访问亚洲一些国家的评论中指出，中印边界问题非常复杂，它从未划定过，双方也从未签定过条约。今天在关于边界的传统界线的观点方面存在着相当大的分歧。
    评论说，解决整个问题的困难不在于它的复杂，而是在于印度的某些政治人士竭力利用分歧来达到自己的目的。他们希望印度同中国的友谊中断，希望把印度拖入军事集团并使印度对内政策向右摆。这些集团从一开始就反对两国政府总理的会谈。所以应把两国总理即将举行会谈的事实视作和平事业的伟大胜利。
    评论说，周恩来总理表示希望他的访问能够促进两国友谊的加强，这个希望是有理由的，虽然即将到来的会谈不一定能导致争端问题的立即解决。但是双方决定继续走会谈的道路已具有重大意义。两国领导人举行会见，会比交换外交照会达到更好的成果。
    评论最后说，西方的反动宣传机构过去和现在都在竭力利用两个亚洲大国的争端。现在它们又扬言周恩来的访问不会成功，说什么在印度和中华人民共和国之间不存在观点接近的道路。但是中国同志们相信，如果双方都有良好的意愿，道路在任何时候都会找到的。
    新华社金边18日电　柬埔寨“友谊报”在今天的社论中说，中国总理周恩来对缅甸、印度和尼泊尔的访问，是亚非人民团结的真实表现。
    社论强调说，周恩来总理在缅甸首都仰光受到了当地居民热烈的和亲切的欢迎。
    这家报纸指出，帝国主义者利用中印边界争端进行破坏，他们在发生中印边界争端时就叫嚷亚非团结的和平共处五项原则和中立政策完结了。
    这家报纸说，实际上，亚非各国人民愈来愈觉醒，第二届亚非人民团结大会的宣言必将打破帝国主义者的梦想。
    新华社巴格达17日电　伊拉克“舆论报”今天发表社论，欢迎周恩来总理访问印度。
    社论说，中国和印度，这两个国家过去曾处于殖民主义和反动的统治之下，这甚至大大阻碍了两国划定地理边界。这种情况为两国中的每一个国家留下许多同邻国的问题。社论接着说，当发生了事件需要确定两国的真正边界时，帝国主义者插进来煽动一个国家反对另一个国家，以便在亚州制造紧张局势，并利用这种局势来反对民族运动，推行帝国主义反对亚洲人民的计划。社论指出，周恩来总理这次到印度去访问具有最重大的意义。首先，这次访问将通过直接谈判，以两国满意的办法来解决边界问题；其次，这次访问将大大有助于巩固这两个大国之间的合作和加强它们之间的关系，从而将形成亚州和平、安全与稳定的巨大支柱。
