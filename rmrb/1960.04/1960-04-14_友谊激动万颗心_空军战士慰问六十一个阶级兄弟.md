Friendship Excites Ten Thousand Hearts
Air Force Soldiers Console Sixty-One Class Brothers

Vivid red peach blossoms and snow-white pear blossoms surrounded the earthen and rocky mountains around Pinglu, Shanxi, like clouds and mist, while emerald green wheat fields seemed to adorn the entire mountain range with pieces of jade. In these days when the earth is full of vitality, officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Air Force, who once pierced through clouds and fog to save their loved ones, formed a慰问团(comfort group), bringing the soldiers' sincere hearts of concern for their class brothers to Pinglu.

"The heroes who traveled thousands of miles from the capital to deliver medicine have arrived!" The 120,000 people of Pinglu County immediately erupted. The old mothers cleaned their cave dwellings even more thoroughly and comfortably, and the old grandfathers placed the best local produce and food on the table, plate after plate. They welcomed the Air Force officers and soldiers who came to offer their condolences into their homes. The sixty-one poisoned miners who were rescued could not suppress the excitement in their hearts. They tightly grasped the soldiers' hands as if they had met relatives they had not seen for a long time. Labor model Zhang Daisheng could only shout "Rescuers sent by Chairman Mao!" before his throat choked up. The strong-willed "female champion" Lei Lanying, who did not shed a single tear during the agonizing moment of being on the verge of death after being poisoned, could not help but burst into tears now. Old miner Niu Chengwa raised his iron-like fist and shouted loudly: "It is the Party that unites us class brothers as one family, and it is the Party's sunshine and nectar that brings us back from the dead. I have nothing else to repay the Party with, except for this body of energy!" After recovering his health from poisoning, this 57-year-old miner pulled a large cart carrying soil, transporting 2,000 catties in one trip.

In the past few days, the sixty-one miners who gained new life adopted new methods for quarrying and digging soil, increasing the amount dug from five cubic meters per person per day to fifteen cubic meters in one fell swoop.

Class friendship spread throughout every valley surrounding Pinglu. Hei Siwa, a labor model from Xiyan Village, Shengrenjian Commune, known as "Old Red," rushed overnight to meet the Air Force soldiers who "traveled a thousand miles at night to deliver the elixir, surpassing the living immortals of the past," and composed a song: "The savior descended from the sky, the savior is the Communist Party, the People's Air Force are heroes, surpassing the Monkey King of the past." Old miner Wang Wenbin, who carried ammunition and transported military supplies for the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, organized a family gratitude assault team after his son Wang Xiaoxian gained new life, rushing to where there was difficulty. Hearing that the Air Force comfort group had arrived, he led the assault team to prevent frost all night, and rushed from dozens of miles away before dawn. In front of the comrades of the comfort group, he instructed his son: "The Party saved you, and also saved our entire family. In the future, our father and son must make a name for ourselves to repay the Party's kindness."

In order to learn from the miners' selfless communist spirit, the Air Force soldiers rushed to the Fengnan Highway construction site and labored shoulder to shoulder with their class brothers. They took off their military coats, rolled up their trouser legs, and raised their iron shovels and large hoes, digging soil and opening mountainsides together with the miners, launching a friendship competition. Mechanic Liu Wanmin, who personally dropped the medicine from the plane during the "Pinglu Incident," worked like a little tiger. He climbed to the middle of the mountainside to swing a large hoe to open the mountain, and then carried soil. As soon as pilot Zhang Pinyuan arrived at the construction site, he picked up a heavy soil basket and carried the soil as if he were flying.

When the comfort group bid farewell to their loved ones and returned to Beijing, the sixty-one class brothers and the people of Pinglu all bid farewell with reluctance, lining the streets to see them off. The girls embroidered the words "Friendship Touches Ten Thousand Hearts" in large characters on their handkerchiefs overnight, embroidering the deep affection of the people of the whole county and giving them to the Air Force soldiers as souvenirs. From Pinglu to the Yuncheng highway, gongs and drums were heard everywhere, firecrackers roared, and the deep class friendship between soldiers and miners was boiling everywhere. (Attached picture)

This is a warm welcome to the heroes who sent the "magic medicine" by the members of the Zhangdian People's Commune.

    友谊激动万颗心
    空军战士慰问六十一个阶级兄弟	新华社记者　王毓琛
    艳红的桃花和皑白的梨花像云霞一般环绕在山西平陆周围的土石山上，碧绿的麦田像给整个山峦镶上了一块块翡翠。在这大地充满了生机的日子里，曾经穿云破雾救亲人的人民解放军北京空军某部官兵，组成一个慰问团，带着战士们关怀阶级弟兄的赤诚的心来到了平陆。
      “首都千里送药的英雄来了！”平陆县十二万人民立刻沸腾起来。老妈妈把窑洞打扫的更加干净舒适，老爷爷把最好的土产食品一盘盘摆在桌上。他们把来慰问的空军官兵接到家里。获救的六十一个中毒民工更压抑不住内心的激动，他们紧紧握住战士的手，像见了久别的亲人。劳动模范张代胜，只叫了一声“毛主席派来的救命恩人！”喉咙就哽住了。性格坚强的“女状元”雷兰英，在中毒后命在旦夕的痛苦关头，没有流一滴眼泪，但是现在她禁不住落泪了。老民工牛成娃举起铁一般的拳头大声说：“是党把咱们阶级弟兄结成一家，是党的阳光和甘露使我们死而复生，我没有别的可以报答党，只有这一身的干劲！”这个五十七岁的老民工，在中毒获救恢复健康后，拉大车运土，一趟就运两千斤。
    六十一个获得新生命的民工这些天开山挖土采取了新的方法，由原来每人每天挖五方，一下子突破了十五方。
    阶级友情传遍了平陆周围的每一个山谷。圣人涧公社西延村人称“老来红”的劳动模范黑司娃，连夜赶来会见“夜行千里送仙丹，赛过当年活神仙”的空军战士，并且编歌唱道：“天上降下来救命王，救命王就是共产党，人民空军是英雄，赛过当年孙大圣。”从抗日战争中就给八路军扛弹药、运军粮的老民工王文彬，在儿子王孝先获得新生命以后，就组织了家属报恩突击队，那里困难就在那里突击。听说空军慰问团来了，他领着突击队通宵防霜，天不亮又从几十里地外赶来，当着慰问团同志的面嘱咐儿子说：“党救活了你，也救活了咱一家人，今后，咱父子俩要干出个样子来，报答党的恩情。”
    空军战士们为了学习民工们忘我的共产主义精神，赶到风南公路工地和阶级弟兄并肩劳动。他们脱掉了军上衣，卷起裤脚，举起铁锹大镐，和民工们一起站在半山腰上开山挖土，展开友谊竞赛。在“平陆事件”中亲手把药品从飞机上投下来的机械师刘万敏，劳动起来像个小老虎，他一会儿爬到半山腰上抡着大镐开山，一会儿又挑土。飞行员张品元，一到工地，就挑起沉重的土筐，像飞一般地挑起土来。
    当慰问团告别亲人返京的时候，六十一个阶级弟兄和平陆人民个个怀着依依惜别的心情夹道相送。姑娘们连夜在手帕上绣上了“友谊感动万颗心”的大字，绣上了全县人民的深情，送给空军战士作纪念。从平陆到运城的公路上，到处锣鼓喧天，鞭炮轰鸣，到处沸腾着战士和民工的深厚的阶级友情。（附图片）
