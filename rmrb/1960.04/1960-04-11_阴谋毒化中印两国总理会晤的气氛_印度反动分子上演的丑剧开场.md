Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 10th: A farce called the "Afro-Asian Tibet and Anti-Colonialism Conference," directed by a small group of notorious reactionary elements in India, was staged in New Delhi on the 9th. The timing of this ugly farce, just before Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to New Delhi, clearly aims to poison the atmosphere of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' meeting and obstruct the rational settlement of the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultation.

According to Indian newspapers, approximately thirty-five Indians and fifty "representatives" from foreign countries participated in this reactionary conference. The leading roles were played by some of India's most vehement anti-China and anti-communist figures, such as the former Praja Socialist Party leader Narayan, who served as chairman of the conference; Masani, a liberal party member and secretary of the pro-American "Congress for Cultural Freedom"; Mehta of the Praja Socialist Party; and Vajpayee of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Also participating in this ugly farce were Raghu Vira and Rao of the Congress Party, Maurice, editor of the "Indian Express," who has close ties with the pro-American "Congress for Cultural Freedom," Majumdar, who calls himself a "historian," and Guha, who organized the anti-China "All-India Tibet Convention" in Calcutta last year.

The report states that eight Tibetan rebel elements attended the conference under the name of the "Tibetan Delegation."

The report says that the conference will discuss the so-called "human rights aspects" and "political aspects" of the Tibet issue. The conference will also use the discussion of the "Afro-Asian anti-colonialist struggle" as a pretext to engage in their despicable acts of interfering in China's internal affairs and undermining the friendly relations between China and other Afro-Asian countries.

While staging this farce, the pro-American "Congress for Cultural Freedom" also organized a so-called "Tibetan Art and Handicraft Exhibition" in an attempt to attract viewers.

A recent issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly stated that "support for the so-called Afro-Asian Tibet Conference comes directly and indirectly from certain carefully selected quarters that have nothing to do with the Afro-Asian countries." The weekly pointed out that "this conference obviously does not have the support of most Afro-Asian governments" because the purpose of holding this conference "is to obstruct the growing goodwill at home and abroad for a peaceful settlement of the Sino-Indian border issue, which is a natural result of the successful conclusion of China's border agreements with Burma and Nepal."

### 阴谋毒化中印两国总理会晤的气氛  印度反动分子上演的丑剧开场

    阴谋毒化中印两国总理会晤的气氛
    印度反动分子上演的丑剧开场
    新华社10日讯　新德里消息：由印度一小撮臭名远扬的反动分子导演的所谓“亚非西藏和反殖民主义会议”的丑剧9日在新德里上演。这出丑剧选择在周恩来总理访问新德里的前夕上演，显然是为了毒化中印两国总理会晤的气氛，阻挠两国通过友好协商合理解决边界问题。
    据印度报纸说，参加这次反动会议的大约有三十五名印度人和五十名来自外国的“代表”。扮演主角的都是一些印度的反华反共的急先锋，如担任会议主席的前人民社会党头子纳拉扬，自由党人、亲美的“文化自由协会”秘书马萨尼，人民社会党的梅达，印度人民同盟的巴志帕伊。参加这出丑剧的还有国大党的拉古·维拉和拉奥，同亲美的“文化自由协会”有密切联系的“印度快报”主编莫雷斯，号称“历史学家”的马朱达以及去年曾经在加尔各答组织反华的“全印西藏会议”的古哈等。
    消息说，八名西藏叛乱分子以“西藏代表团”的名义出席会议。
    消息说，会议将讨论所谓西藏问题的“人权方面”和“政治方面”。会议还将以讨论“亚非反殖民主义斗争”为名，来进行他们干涉中国内政，破坏中国和亚非其他国家的友好关系的卑鄙勾当。
    在上演这幕丑剧的同时，亲美的“文化自由协会”还组织了一个所谓“西藏艺术和手工业品展览会”，企图招引观众。
    最近一期的“德里时代”周报说，“对于所谓亚非西藏会议的支持，直接和间接来自经过很好选择的某些方面，而这些方面是同亚非国家毫不相干的”。这家周报指出，“这次会议显然得不到大部分亚非国家政府的支持”，因为召开这次会议的目的“是要阻挠国内外日益增长的争取和平解决中印边界问题的良好意愿，这种意愿是中国同缅甸和尼泊尔的边界协定成功地缔结之后的自然结果”。
