    The ones who love the sky, are the sun and the moon;
    The ones who love the children, are the father and the mother;
    The one who loves all nationalities, is the great Chairman Mao!
    ——Yugur Folk Song
    Speech by Delegate Shu Sheyu
    Fellow Delegates:
    Our nationwide continued leap forward and constant revolution is one of the greatest historical facts of the 1960s. We don't like to exaggerate, and we dare not be complacent, but we should not lack confidence: in the grand chorus of mankind's progress in the future, our voice will be extremely majestic and loud.
    In this spring, with blossoming flowers and thriving scenery, our literary cause is also colorful and unprecedentedly beautiful. We are particularly pleased and proud of the rapid development of the literary cause of our fraternal nationalities, progressing at a tremendous pace. Please allow me to use this as the title to express my simple speech with infinite joy.
    The great Lu Xun had an unfinished work, "A Draft History of Han Literature." From the title of this book, we can see Lu Xun's deep insight. Yes, many Chinese literary histories that we find in libraries should really be called Han Chinese literary histories, because they do not discuss the achievements and characteristics of the literature of fraternal nationalities. Even if their authors do not have Han chauvinistic prejudices, it is clearly inappropriate to represent Chinese literary history with Han literary history. China is a multi-ethnic country, and the fraternal nationalities each have a long literary tradition!
    Now it's great, at least twelve fraternal nationalities such as Tibetan and Mongolian have initially compiled their own literary histories, and the literary histories of the Bai and Naxi nationalities have already been published. This is a great thing! In the future, the Chinese literary history we compile will undoubtedly include the literary histories of all fraternal nationalities, which will be so comprehensive and colorful! Such a Chinese literary history will add so much novel and valuable information to encyclopedias and world literary history!
    Over the past ten years, large numbers of experts, college students, performing arts troupes, and cadres have gone deep into the areas of fraternal nationalities, collecting hundreds of thousands of classical and folk literary works. It is truly like entering a treasure mountain, full of dazzling things. Just taking Yunnan Province as an example, in the past two or three years alone, more than 100,000 works have been obtained, including more than 60 epics and long narrative poems! Think about it, a long poem like "Ashima" has attracted the attention of the whole country and even the world, and now we have obtained more than 60 more! And this is just the harvest of Yunnan Province; Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan and other provinces have also carried out similar excavation and sorting work! The great motherland has literary fields and treasures everywhere!
    The epic "The Epic of King Gesar," which has long been famous throughout the world and shared by the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities, has also been sorted and translated in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Gansu. So many classical masterpieces and folk literary treasures of fraternal nationalities, which were unknown before liberation, are now shining again and becoming the spiritual wealth of the whole country and all mankind!
    We do not value the past and despise the present. We collect and sort out heritage, and also create new literature.
    Before liberation, only a few nationalities such as Mongolian and Uyghur had a few professional writers. What about today? Each fraternal nationality has more than 200 writers who have been accepted as members by the China Writers Association or its branches. This team is not small; some nationalities have never had professional writers before. In addition to this professional team, there are also a large number of amateur authors who have emerged from the mass creation movement. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and herdsmen have all begun to pick up pens, and thus on the vast grasslands or under the snowy Tianshan Mountains, poetic style and singing rain express the enthusiasm for socialist construction and the joy of national unity.
    Chairman Saifuddin and Comrade Burhan have both written excellent literary works.
    The more I think about it, the happier I get! How can I not be happy? The warriors of this team are armed with Mao Zedong Thought on literature and art as soon as they join the army! Some writers may have only inherited myths and ancient legends as literary heritage, but they have leaped into the garden of socialist realism in literature and art, and the first flower exudes the fragrance and brilliance of socialist realism! All of a sudden, they leap forward several hundred or several thousand years! This is a miracle in the history of world literature!
    Before liberation, literary books and periodicals published in the languages of fraternal nationalities were extremely rare. Now, there are literary publications in Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Korean. Chinese literary publications also often publish works by writers of fraternal nationalities. In the past ten years, about seven or eight hundred books have been published in the languages of fraternal nationalities.
    During the Great Leap Forward, many dramas featuring the lives and struggles of fraternal nationalities appeared throughout the country. The Chinese long novels written by some writers of fraternal nationalities have sold hundreds of thousands of copies.
    Literary exchanges between nationalities greatly help mutual understanding and unity between nationalities. What is most lacking now is translation talent, which should be cultivated more quickly.
    Without the great national policies and literary policies of the Party and Chairman Mao, the fraternal nationalities would have no way to enjoy the happiness of liberation, and the literary cause of the fraternal nationalities would be out of the question. Although my speech is short, my gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao is as high as the mountains and as long as the rivers, and will never end! I believe that all writers of fraternal nationalities share the same feelings! We will be with the writers of the whole country, actively study Mao Zedong Thought, and go deep into life, in order to write works that are more, faster, better, and more economically beneficial to socialist construction and to the development of socialist national relations!
    “The ones who love the sky,
    Are the sun and the moon;
    The ones who love the children,
    Are the father and the mother;
    The one who loves all nationalities,
    Is the great Chairman Mao!” (Yugur Folk Song)
    Yes, all of us minority writers are willing to sing the praises of the great Chairman Mao and the great Communist Party, who love all our nationalities, in different languages, in various literary forms, with fiery enthusiasm, and with pearl-like words!

    兄弟民族的诗风歌雨
    那热爱天空的，是太阳和月亮；
    那热爱孩子的，是父亲和母亲；
    那热爱各族人民的，是伟大的毛主席！
    ——裕固族民歌
    舒舍予代表的发言各位代表：
    我们的全民继续跃进，不断革命，是二十世纪六十年代最伟大的历史事实之一。我们不喜夸张，更不敢自满，可是不应不自信：在今后人类历史前进曲的大合唱中，我们的声音是极其雄壮响亮的。
  在这春暖花开，欣欣向荣的风光里，我们的文学事业也正是万紫千红，空前美丽。特别使我们高兴并自豪的是兄弟民族文学事业的飞跃发展，一日千里。就请允许我用此为题，以无限的欣喜，作简单的发言。
    伟大的鲁迅有一部未完稿的著作——“汉文学史纲要”。由这个书名就看出鲁迅的深识卓见。是呀，我们在图书馆里找到的不少部中国文学史，实在都该叫作汉族文学史，因为它们并未论及兄弟民族文学的成就与特色。即使它们的著者并没有大汉族主义的偏见，可是以汉族文学史去代表中国文学史显然有欠妥当，中国是个多民族的国家，而兄弟民族又各有悠久的文学传统啊！
    现在可好了，至少有藏、蒙等十二个兄弟民族已经初步编成了自己的文学史，其中白族与纳西族的文学史业已出版。这是件了不起的事！我们今后编写的中国文学史，无疑地要把各兄弟民族的文学史包括进去，那该是多么全面，多么丰富多彩啊！这样的一部中国文学史将要给百科全书与世界文学史增添多少新颖而珍贵的资料啊！
    十年来，我们先后有大批的专家、大学生、文工团、干部深入兄弟民族地区，搜集到多少万件古典的和民间的文学作品真是如入宝山，琳琅满目。单说云南一省，在近两三年来，就获得了作品十万件，其中有史诗与长篇叙事诗六十多部！想想看，一部像“阿诗玛”那样的长诗就引起了全国、乃至于全世界的注意，现在我们又得到六十多部啊！而且这只是云南一省的收获；四川、贵州、广西，湖南等省份也进行了同样的发掘与整理工作啊！伟大的祖国，到处都有文学的蓝田与宝库！
    对早已驰誉全世，蒙、藏两民族共有的史诗“格萨尔王传”，也先后在内蒙古、青海、甘肃分别进行了整理与翻译工作。多少兄弟民族的古典巨作与民间文学的珍品，在解放前都淹没无闻，今天却重放光明，成为全国的、全人类的精神财富！
  我们不厚古薄今。我们搜集、整理遗产，也创造崭新的文学。
    解放前，只有蒙古、维吾尔等几个民族，有少数的专业作家。今天呢，各兄弟民族已有二百多位作家，被中国作家协会总会或分会接纳为会员。这个队伍不小；有的民族向来没有过专业作家啊。在这个专业队伍之外，还有大批的由群众创作运动中出现的业余作者。工、农、兵、牧都开始拿起笔来，于是茫茫的草原上，或积雪的天山下，诗风歌雨，表达着社会主义建设的热情，民族大团结的欣喜。
    赛福鼎主席和包尔汉同志都写出了优美的文学作品。
    越想越高兴！怎能不高兴呢，这个队伍的战士们刚一入伍便是以毛主席的文艺思想武装起来的啊！有些作家所继承的文学遗产也许只是神话与古远的传说，可是他们一跃而进入社会主义现实主义的文艺花园里，头一朵花便吐露着社会主义现实主义的香气与光彩！一下子，他们跃进了几百年或几千年！这是世界文学史中的一个奇迹！
    解放前，用兄弟民族文字出版的文学书刊是绝无仅有的。现在，有了蒙文、维吾尔文、哈萨克文、朝鲜文等文学刊物。汉文的文学刊物也经常刊载兄弟民族作家的作品。十年来，用兄弟民族文字出版的书籍约达七八百种。
    在大跃进中，全国出现了许多以兄弟民族人民生活与斗争为内容的话剧。有的兄弟民族作家的汉文本长篇小说行销几十万册。
    各民族的文学交流大有助于民族间的互相了解与团结一致。现在最感缺乏的是翻译人材，应当加紧培养。
    没有党和毛主席的伟大民族政策与文艺政策，兄弟民族便无从享受解放的幸福，兄弟民族的文学事业更无从谈起。我的发言虽然简短，可是对党和毛主席的感激是山高水长，永无休止的！我相信，所有的兄弟民族作家都是人同此心，心同此理的！我们将与全国的作家在一起，积极学习毛泽东思想，深入生活，以期更加多快好省地写出有益于社会主义建设，有益于发展社会主义民族关系的作品来！
    “那热爱天空的，
    是太阳和月亮；
    那热爱孩子的，
    是父亲和母亲；
    那热爱各族人民的，
    是伟大的毛主席！”（裕固族民歌）
    是的，我们所有的少数民族作家，都愿以不同的语言，各种各样的文学形式，火一般的热情，珍珠一般的词藻，歌颂热爱我们各族人民的伟大毛主席，伟大共产党！
