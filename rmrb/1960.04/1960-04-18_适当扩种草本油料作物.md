Suggestion

    To the editors:
    I am using a corner of the newspaper to make a suggestion to the relevant departments.
    While taking grain as the key link and planning oil crop production in a planned way, I suggest that areas with suitable conditions appropriately expand the planting of herbaceous drying oil crops, such as flax, perilla seed, and hemp, especially flax. These oil crops are the main raw materials for the paint industry.
    Applying oil to various metal and wood products can protect them from the effects of the atmosphere, acids, alkalis, rain, humidity, and microbial corrosion (about 40% of metals are damaged by corrosion); coatings can also prevent electric wires from leaking electricity and prevent canned foods from deteriorating; airplanes, automobiles, trains, and various machines cannot leave the factory without paint; ships, bridges, factories, etc., must be repainted at regular intervals.
    Flax, also known as oil flax, hemp, also known as cannabis, commonly known as "small hemp seed," and perilla seed, also known as stubble seed, is a plant of the same family as perilla. They are all annual herbaceous plants, sown in spring and harvested in autumn, mainly produced in Northeast China, Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei provinces, and scattered planting is also found in the South. The oil from these crops is not only an important industrial oil, but also a major edible oil in the main producing areas. Like other oil crops, the by-products can provide fertilizers, feed, and industrial raw materials, such as paper making, rope making, hemp bag fiber, and potassium carbonate.
    In recent years, although the output of flax and other oil crops has increased compared with the early days of liberation, the rate of development still cannot meet objective needs. It is hoped that areas suitable for planting these oil crops will vigorously develop them under the principles of overall planning and taking grain as the key link.

### 适当扩种草本油料作物

专栏：建议

    适当扩种草本油料作物编辑同志：
    借报纸一角之地向有关部门提出一个建议。
    在以粮为纲，有计划地安排油料作物生产的同时，建议有条件的地区适当扩种草本干性的油料作物，如胡麻、苏籽、线麻等，特别是胡麻。这几种油料作物是涂料工业的主要原料。
    各种金属和木质的产品涂上油料，能免受大气、酸、碱、雨水、潮湿和微生物腐蚀的影响（约有40％的金属是被腐蚀损坏的）；涂料还能使电线不走电，使罐头食品不变质；飞机、汽车、火车和各种机器如果没有油漆便不能出厂；船舶、桥梁、厂房等隔一定时期必须重新油饰一次。
    胡麻又名油亚麻，线麻又称大麻，俗名“小麻籽”，苏籽又称茬籽，是紫苏的同科植物。它们都是一年生的草本植物，春种秋收，主要产于我国东北、西北、内蒙古和河北等省区，南方也有分散种植。这些作物的油不仅是重要的工业用油，而且在主产区也是主要的食油。它们和其它的油料作物一样，副产品都能提供肥料、饲料和工业原料，如造纸、制绳、制麻袋的纤维和炭酸钾等。
    几年来，胡麻等油料产量虽较解放初期有所提高，但发展速度仍不能适应客观需要。希望适宜种植这些油料的地区，在统筹兼顾和以粮为纲的原则下，大力发展。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　尤之
