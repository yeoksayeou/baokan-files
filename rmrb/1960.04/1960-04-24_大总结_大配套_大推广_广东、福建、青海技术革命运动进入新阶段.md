Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Guangdong Province, having achieved significant victories in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, has rapidly and comprehensively transitioned into a new stage of consolidation, promotion, and improvement. Many individual and dispersed innovation projects from the previous stage have been coordinated into complete systems, and those that were not perfect have been improved. Currently, this movement is advancing vigorously towards automation and semi-automation.

Through organized large-scale inspections, demonstrations, evaluations, summations, coordination, and promotions, various industries have found effective methods for consolidating, promoting, and improving innovation achievements. Since late March, Guangdong has been conducting summations and inspections of the large number of innovation projects that emerged during the rapid technical revolution movement over the past month or so, identifying problems and addressing them promptly. The Shantou Special District formed nearly two hundred inspection and acceptance teams/groups consisting of leading cadres, workers, and engineering technicians, going deep into factories and mines to identify and solve problems through inspection, observation, listening, and inquiry, thus promoting the improvement and enhancement of innovation projects. Shantou City carried out mass technical experience evaluations, demonstrations, and coordination, and formed thirty-two mobile demonstration and observation teams, which went to one hundred and thirty units for on-site observation, demonstration, presentation of treasures, and learning, summarizing and promoting a total of seven hundred and forty-six important experiences from various industries. In response to the situation in Jiangmen City, where many innovation projects could not be used normally due to technical issues in the previous stage, a large-scale demonstration of usage projects was launched to improve workers' technical level; professional teams were organized by industry and factory to overcome technical barriers, so that innovation projects could be realized as soon as possible. In addition, various regions organized promotion teams and observation teams by industry and type of work to promote advanced experience in sets to various factories, so that existing successful advanced experience could blossom everywhere. The Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry formed a promotion team of advanced experience to perform in various places, which has enabled the promotion of twenty-six major advanced experiences in the mechanical industry throughout the province.

Due to the large number and dispersion of new technologies and new experiences created in the previous stage, and the fact that some were not comprehensive enough, there was an urgent need to concentrate these new creations, learn from each other's strengths, coordinate them into complete systems, and then promote them comprehensively. Since late March, Guangzhou has adopted six forms in the city's industrial transportation sector to carry out large-scale experience coordination work: complete industrial coordination, industry-specific coordination by type of work, professional technical coordination of the same type of work in different industries, one-stop coordination of a factory, coordination of a machine tool (equipment) with the most advanced experience, and coordination of industrial production and transportation. By April 5, it had coordinated the scattered and imperfect experiences of twenty industries such as weaving, casting, fitter, and steel rolling under the city and one hundred and sixty industries under the districts, thus rapidly realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire industry.

In the past half month or so, many new creations have emerged in various places. A factory section without personnel management has emerged in Guangzhou Chemical Factory. The electromechanical industry has also achieved seven major innovations. In addition to continuing to improve the degree of mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the light industry, textile, and other industries have also seen many important innovations. In addition, a number of important innovation projects have also emerged in medium-sized cities such as Shantou and Haikou.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: The vast urban and rural areas of Fujian Province are showing a great scene of technical revolution like a raging fire, and the speed of increasing production is changing with each passing day. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the province's industrial systems has been rapidly improved. Many projects that have already achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized production are rapidly advancing from one process in one factory to the entire industry, the entire region, and towards the goals of automation and semi-automation. On the agricultural front, after the coordination of complete sets and the successive promotion of more than 12 million new agricultural tools and machinery for farming, transportation, drainage, irrigation and processing, now, in conjunction with the busy spring planting, spring sowing and spring harvesting, efforts are concentrated on the large-scale production and large-scale use of rice transplanters, harvesters and threshing machines, thus overcoming the historically rare spring drought and ensuring a comprehensive great leap forward in various preparatory work and spring production.

In the mass technical innovation and technical revolution by the whole people, all regions have adhered to the principles of self-reliance, indigenous methods, starting from indigenous methods and moving towards foreign methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Thus, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses have been mobilized to the greatest extent, and various difficulties encountered in the manufacture of equipment and the reform of tools, such as materials, technology and equipment, have been solved, ensuring that the movement can continue to develop in depth wave after wave.

The staff of the aquatic product processing department in Jinjiang County used bamboo, wood and scrap iron to successfully create a complete set of fish processing equipment such as fish filleting machines, shrimp shellers, fish catching machines, dryers, fish washing machines, and slicers, which improved work efficiency by one to one hundred and two times, and realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of all processes in fish processing such as washing, cutting, cooking, transporting, and weighing.

The Fuzhou horn combs and other well-known Chinese and foreign daily-use handicrafts, which have always been considered impossible to produce by machinery, have been successfully manufactured with semi-mechanized electric horn sawing machines, tooth sawing machines, tooth picking machines, and polishing machines under the bold creation of comb-making workers, freeing workers from strenuous manual labor and increasing production efficiency by one and a half to ten times. One hundred and seven employees of the Dazhuang Forest Farm in Pucheng County used indigenous methods and indigenous materials to create and imitate twenty-eight kinds of reforestation hoes, Masson pine direct seeding machines, land preparation shovels, tree planting machines, and soil loosening machines, which realized the improvement of tools, the semi-mechanization of farming, and the vehicle transportation, and increased production efficiency by two to twenty times.

Inspired by slogans such as "Great emancipation of the mind, everyone engages in innovation" and "Use foreign methods when possible, use indigenous methods when necessary," employees of metallurgical, mechanical and other heavy industries and modern enterprises have also broken the "conditional theory" and the idea that "it is difficult to innovate further," and have used indigenous methods and indigenous materials to manufacture a large number of high, large, precise and cutting-edge products and equipment. Employees of the Xiamen General Machinery Factory adopted methods such as ants gnawing at bones to successfully manufacture a 250-ton cantilever hydraulic press with large components and high precision, which not only solved the problem of processing large steel parts, but also freed the factory's forgers from heavy physical labor.

In the technical revolution of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation carried out in stages and batches, employees in various places have fully carried forward the spirit of communist cooperation, thus ensuring that various technical innovation and technical revolution work is done more, faster, better and more economically.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining: The torrent of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement is fiercely impacting all departments and corners of Qinghai Province. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and herdsmen in all walks of life in the province have overcome numerous difficulties in terms of technical strength, equipment, and materials from many aspects, first focusing on heavy physical labor and tedious manual operations. Backward production methods in factories and mines mainly based on manual operations are gradually becoming a thing of the past, and old and outdated production tools are being eliminated and transformed in batches. According to incomplete statistics, departments across the province put forward more than 2 million rationalization proposals in the first quarter, and more than 400,000 were adopted and implemented, increasing work efficiency by one to thousands of times respectively.

Now, the trend of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Qinghai Province has developed from scattered, single innovations to the technical transformation of the entire operation process. The construction sector alone has 220 processes coordinated into complete systems. Some enterprises have also seen unmanned automatic lines.

"Find materials yourself if you don't have them, draw your own blueprints if you don't have them, make your own tools if you don't have them, and use substitute materials if you don't have steel." The employees of Qinghai Province unfolded the technical great innovation and technical great revolution with such heroic spirit. Xining No. 1 Wood Factory, which started with a few planes and saws, took the lead, continuously overcoming the difficulties of materials and technology, and successfully trial-produced more than fifty pieces of indigenous machines such as plywood milling machines, mixers, gluing machines, presses, and powder sieving machines, increasing work efficiency by one to thirty times respectively. Employees of the Xining Municipal Real Estate Bureau Wood Processing Factory used old wood, collected discarded chains, rollers, flywheels, pedal cranks, and old screws from bicycles to piece together machine parts, and made combined door and window machines, planing machines, drilling machines, and riveting machines, which changed the backward face of manual operations in one fell swoop. Construction workers experimented fifty or sixty times and finally created an electric bricklaying machine, making the dream of bricklaying workers for thousands of years to get rid of trowels and large shovels a reality. Li Guiyun, a female worker at the Xining Rubber Factory, saw in the operation that manual tire filing could not keep up with the needs of tire repair, so she ran to the waste recycling station to find materials; after returning, she worked day and night with her lover to figure out and trial-produce, and after many failures, she finally successfully manufactured an electric tire grinding machine to replace manual operation. In March, the employees of this factory created a total of nineteen indigenous machines, enabling the factory to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization. What is even more prominent is the Qinghai Wool Textile Factory, which is under construction and production at the same time. All the employees of the factory carried forward the communist style of daring to think and dare to do, using wood instead of steel to make various indigenous machine tools, and then using the indigenous machine tools to make more than a dozen kinds of textile machines such as spinning machines, twisting machines, wool carding machines, and piecing machines. The Qinghai Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Department Leather Factory, which created the fast soaking ash operation method for sheepskin lining leather and horsehide surface leather, completed the five processes of alkali soaking, hair removal, ash soaking, pool pulling, and hair removal at one time, shortening the soaking ash cycle of leather making to the minimum limit, increasing work efficiency by more than 1,500 times, and greatly reducing the labor intensity of workers.

Strengthening the leadership of the Party and carrying out mass movements on a large scale are the key to the rapid, widespread, in-depth, and sustained development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Qinghai Province. As early as December last year, the Party organizations of many factories and mines led the workers and masses to start reforming the heavy manual labor. In March this year, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued "Instructions on Further Launching a Comprehensive Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement," and established a technical innovation and technical revolution leading group and office to specifically lead this movement. The provincial-level departments, bureaus, and the Party committees of various prefectures, cities, and counties have also established leading organizations for technical innovation and technical revolution, led by a secretary personally. The Party organizations at all levels also formulated comprehensive plans for technical innovation and technical revolution based on the specific circumstances of their departments and units, adopting the method of combining top-down and bottom-up, so as to promote the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution with mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation as the content in a more planned, organized, and leadership-driven manner.

    大总结　大配套　大推广
    广东、福建、青海技术革命运动进入新阶段
    广东
    据新华社广州讯　广东省在以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动取得重大胜利的基础上，迅速、全面地转入了巩固、推广、提高的新阶段。前一阶段涌现出的许多单个、分散的革新项目已经配套成龙，不够完善的也得到改进。目前这一运动正向自动化、半自动化的方向猛进。
    通过有组织的大检查、大表演、大评比、大总结、大配套、大推广，是各行各业巩固、推广、提高革新成果的有效方法。从3月下旬以来，广东各地都对在过去一个多月急风骤雨般的技术革命运动中出现的大批革新项目，先后进行总结、检查，从中发现问题，及时加以改进和解决。汕头专区各县组成近两百个有领导干部、工人和工程技术人员参加的三结合检查验收团、组，深入厂矿用查、看、听、问的办法发现问题，解决问题，促进了革新项目的改进和提高。汕头市开展群众性的技术经验大评比、大表演、大配套，并组成三十二个巡回表演观摩队，分赴一百三十个单位进行现场观摩、表演、献宝、取经，共总结、推广了各行各业的重要经验七百四十六项。江门市针对前一阶段不少革新项目因技术未过关而不能正常运用的情况，一面开展使用项目大表演，提高工人技术水平；一面按行业、厂矿组织专业队攻克技术关，也使革新项目尽快实现，此外，各地还按产业、工种组织推广先进经验工作队、观摩队，集中成套先进经验到各厂巡回推广，使现有成功的先进经验遍地开花。省机械工业厅组成推广先进经验工作队到各地作巡回表演，已使机械行业的二十六项主要先进经验在全省范围内推广。
    由于前一阶段创造的新技术、新经验数量多而分散，一部分还不够全面，迫切需要把这些新创造集中起来，取长补短，配套成龙，然后加以全面推广。广州市从3月下旬以来在全市工业交通运输部门采取了整门工业大配套、各行业按工种配套、不同行业相同工种专业技术配套、一个工厂一条龙配套、一种机床（设备）用最先进的经验配套以及工业生产和交通运输配套等六种形式，进行大规模的经验配套工作以后，到4月5日，已把市属织布、铸造、钳工、轧钢等二十个行业和区属一百六十个行业的分散的、不够完善的经验配成了套，因而迅速实现了全行业机械化、半机械化。
    最近半个多月，各地又涌现了很多新创造。广州化工厂已经出现了一个无人管理工段。机电行业也实现了七项重大革新。轻工、纺织等行业除继续提高机械化、自动化、半自动化程度外，也都有不少重要革新出现。此外，中等城市汕头、海口等地也涌现了一批重要革新项目。
    福建
    据新华社福州讯  福建省广大城市和乡村，到处都呈现着技术革命如火似荼，增产速度日新月异的大好景象。全省各工业系统的机械化半机械化程度迅速提高。许多已经实现机械化半机械化生产的项目，迅即由一个工序一个工厂向全行业、全地区和自动化半自动化的目标驰进。在农业战线上，继成龙配套、先后推广了一千二百多万件耕作、运输、排灌加工等新式农具、农械之后，现在正结合春种春播和春收大忙，集中人力、物力大制大用插秧机、收割机和脱谷机，从而战胜了历史上罕见的春旱，保证了各种备耕工作和春季生产的全面大跃进。
    各地在全民大闹技术革新和技术革命中，都坚持贯彻自力更生、土法上马、由土到洋、土洋结合的方针，因而最大限度地调动了群众的积极性和创造性，使制造设备、改革工具中所遇到的材料、技术和设备等各种各样的困难，都迎刃而解，保证了运动能一浪高过一浪地持续不断地深入开展。
    晋江县水产加工部门的职工利用竹木和废铁等，创造成功了剖鱼机、虾米脱壳机、捞鱼机、烘干机、洗鱼机、切片机等整套鱼类加工设备，提高工效一倍到一百零二倍，使鱼类加工中的洗、割、炊、运、秤等工序，全部实现了机械化半机械化。
    历来认为无法用机械生产的福州角梳等驰名中外的日用手工艺品，在制梳工人的大胆创造下，制造成功了半机械化的电动锯角机、锯齿机、剔齿机、磨光机等机器，使工人摆脱了吃力的手工劳动，生产效率提高了一倍半到十倍。浦城县大庄林场一百零七个职工用土办法、土材料先后创造和仿制了造林锄、马尾松直播器、整地铲、植树器、松土器等二十八种，实现了工具改良化、耕作半机械化、运输车子化、生产效率提高了二倍到二十倍。
    在“思想大解放，人人搞革新”“能洋则洋，能土则土”等口号鼓舞下，冶金、机械等重工业和现代化企业职工，也打破了“条件论”和“难于再革新”等思想，用土办法、土器材制造了大批高大精尖的产品和设备。厦门通用机器厂职工采用蚂蚁啃骨头等办法，制造成功了一台部件很大、精密度很高的二百五十吨悬臂式水压机，既解决了大型钢件的加工问题，又使厂内锻工摆脱了繁重的体力劳动。
    各地职工在分期分批大搞机械化半机械化自动化半自动化的技术革命中，都充分发扬了共产主义协作精神，从而保证了各种技术革新和技术革命工作作得又多又快又好又省。
    青海
    据新华社西宁讯  全民性技术革新和技术革命运动的洪流正在猛烈冲击着青海省各个部门和各个角落。全省各行各业的广大职工、农牧民，从多方面克服技术力量、设备和材料的重重困难，首先猛攻笨重的体力劳动和繁琐的手工操作。以手工操作为主的厂矿企业，落后的生产方法逐渐成为历史的陈迹，古老陈旧的生产工具一批批被淘汰和改造。据不完全统计，全省第一季度各部门提出的合理化建议就有二百多万件，经采纳实现的达四十多万件，分别提高工效一倍到千倍以上。
    现在，青海省技术革新和技术革命运动的趋势，已经从分散的、单项的革新发展到整个操作过程的技术改造。仅建筑部门就有二百二十项工序配套成龙。有的企业还出现了无人控制的自动线。
    “没有材料自己找，没有图纸自己描，没有工具自己造，没有钢材用代料”。青海省的职工就是以这样的英雄气概，展开了技术大革新和技术大革命。由几把刨子、锯子起家的西宁第一木工厂，一马当先，连续克服材料和技术的困难，试制成功胶合板铣车、搅拌机、涂胶机、压力机、粉筛机等土机器五十多台（件），分别提高工效一到三十倍。西宁市房产局木材加工厂职工利用旧木料，收集自行车上废弃的链条、滚轴、飞轮、脚踏拐和旧螺丝等拼凑成机器零件，制成了联合门窗机、刨料机、打眼机、开铆机，一举改变了手工操作的落后面貌。建筑工人试验了五、六十次，终于创制成功电动砌砖机，使千百年来砌砖工人渴望丢掉瓦刀、大铲的理想变成了现实。西宁橡胶厂女工李桂云，在操作中看到手工锉胎总是赶不上补胎的需要，她就跑到废品收购站找寻材料；回来以后，同爱人一起日夜琢磨试制，经过了许多次失败，最后制造成功电动磨胎机，代替了手工操作。在3月份内，这个工厂的职工共创制了十九台土机器，使全厂实现了机械化、半机械化。更加突出的是边建设、边生产的青海毛纺厂。全厂职工发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，用木料代替钢材制成各种土机床，然后又用土机床制出了纺纱机、合股捻线机、弹毛机、拼凑机等十几种纺织机器。创造羊皮里革和马皮面革揉制快速浸灰操作法的青海省农垦厅皮革厂，把原来摸碱、扒毛、浸灰、拉池、脱毛五道工序一次完成，使皮革揉制浸灰周期缩短到最低限度，提高工效一千五百多倍，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。
    加强党的领导和大搞群众运动，是青海省技术革新和技术革命运动迅速、广泛、深入、持久开展的关键。早在去年12月，许多厂矿企业的党组织就领导职工群众针对手工操作的笨重劳动开始进行改革。今年3月间，中共青海省委又发出了“关于进一步开展全面的技术革新和技术革命运动的指示”，成立了技术革新和技术革命领导小组和办公室，专门领导这一运动。省级各厅、局和各州、市、县委，也都建立了技术革新和技术革命的领导机构，由一位书记亲自领导。各级党组织还根据本部门、本单位的具体情况，采取自上而下和自下而上的相结合的办法，普遍订出了技术革新和技术革命的全面规划，使以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为内容的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，更加有计划、有组织、有领导地向前推进。
