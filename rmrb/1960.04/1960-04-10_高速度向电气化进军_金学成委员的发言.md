Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report. The reports given by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin are all inspiring, and I express my warm support.

I recently inspected small and large hydropower stations in Jinhua and Xin'anjiang, Zhejiang Province, and deeply felt the radiant glory of the Party's general line for socialist construction. It not only illuminates the cities but also the countryside, and it not only promotes industry but also agriculture and all other undertakings. At the same time, I deeply feel that under the correct leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao, the three magic weapons of the general line, the people's communes, and the Great Leap Forward will continue to exert their unparalleled power. They will certainly accelerate the construction of our poor and blank country into a strong socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern defense. Furthermore, they will definitely actively prepare the conditions to accelerate the realization of the highest ideal of mankind: a communist society. Here, let me briefly talk about the construction of the hydropower stations I saw and some of my thoughts.

North of Jinhua City, Zhejiang, there is a people's commune called Shuanglong Commune with a population of 60,000 and 95,000 mu of land. This commune is located in a mountainous area, and since ancient times, whenever there were mountain floods, the land would be submerged, and if it didn't rain for one or two months, there would be a drought. Before liberation, most of the people there made a living by chopping firewood, relying on a carrying pole to survive. They said, "A cloth bag hangs from the carrying pole, one pot of soup and half a pot of vegetables," life was very hard, truly a poor mountain village. After liberation, production gradually developed, and the people's living standards also improved a lot. However, when this commune was first established, it was still a poor commune compared to other communes. After the establishment of the commune, the Party issued a great call to conquer nature, tame the Shuanglong, and benefit the people. Immediately, a mass movement to control mountains and rivers, build reservoirs and hydropower stations was launched in this commune. For a whole year, day and night, they split mountains and dug canals, causing the Shuanglong Spring, Jiulong Spring, and Lutian Spring to cross mountains and ridges and converge. From a height of 195 meters, through a 396-meter-long high-pressure water pipe, a huge impact force was formed. Although the flow rate was only 0.6, it could drive a 750-kilowatt generator to generate electricity. This was the Shuanglong Power Station, the first to be established in this commune. From then on, nature was conquered, small water became great use, and the poor mountain village generated electricity and released light. The commune members said:

	Since ancient times, three waters have been in different directions,
	The power of the people moved the stream,
	Flowing east to west,
	Flowing west to east,
	Three waters merge into one stream,
	Small water drives large generators.

Then, in October 1959, the Party pointed out that we must advance towards high-speed electrification and mechanization. This commune immediately mobilized the masses and built five power stations in fifty days, averaging one power station every ten days. There are also two under construction. Thus, there are a total of eight power stations in this commune, forming a one-ridge eight-station power grid. At the same time, with the Shuanglong Reservoir as the center, ten reservoirs are connected. Thus, a one-ridge eight-station, ten-reservoir linked system was formed, like a long vine bearing melons, achieving multiple uses of water.

From then on, the Shuanglong Commune had both a power grid and an irrigation network, enabling 30,000 mu of land to be irrigated by gravity flow. In addition, electricity was also used for flour milling, sawing wood, making tofu, processing non-staple foods, artificial rainfall stations, tap water stations, as well as hairdressing, cutting vegetables, and so on. The cultivated land was plowed with electric plows, and old wooden plows entered the museum. Every household was equipped with electric lights. Electricity has not only brought tremendous changes to production, but it has also brought a new life to people. It truly achieved: no need for oil for lighting, no need for cows for plowing, automatic irrigation, and no worries about food and clothing. The face of the poor mountain village has been rapidly changed, barren mountains have become mountains of treasure, and the poor commune has become a rich commune. The commune members are all overjoyed, and they say:

	The Party's leadership brings happiness for ten thousand years,
	One ridge with eight stations, ten reservoirs connected,
	Control mountains and rivers, irrigate and generate electricity,
	Truly Shuanglong rejoices, bringing joy to the world.

In addition to these small hydropower stations, we also visited the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, which is under construction. This is a large hydropower station that happens to be in contrast to some of the small power stations in the Shuanglong Commune. When the construction of this power station is completed, it will be able to supply a large amount of cheap electricity to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jiangxi, and southern Anhui, with a cost of less than half a cent (0.48 fen) per kilowatt-hour. After this power station is built, the Jiangnan area will take this power station as the center, connecting all the large and small, thermal and hydropower units in this area to form an unprecedentedly large-scale Jiangnan power grid, which will have a huge impact on the Jiangnan area. As for the so-called "peak" power supply problem that has long been unresolved in places like Shanghai, it can certainly be solved. The role of this power station is not only to make industry more developed, but it will also greatly promote the modernization of rural areas. Just as the heroes building the Xin'anjiang Power Station sang:

	High-voltage lines are pulled, power towers are erected,
	Power lines are like spider webs, power towers are like pagodas.
	The power station is built, the power generation capacity is large,
	From factories to farmers' homes, it is used everywhere.
	Jiangxi and southern Anhui, the Ning-Hu-Hang area,
	Industry is more developed, agriculture is electrified.

Moreover, the economic benefits of this power station are not just about generating electricity. At the same time, it can also store floodwaters, eliminate water disasters and droughts in more than 300,000 mu of farmland downstream of the Xin'anjiang River; it can raise a large number of fish; it can facilitate transportation, and after the Qililong Power Station is built, it can also allow 3,000-ton ships to pass. Such a comprehensive utilization hydropower station is rare in the world. Moreover, the entire design, manufacturing, and equipment construction of this power station are all done by China itself. Last year, when Premier Zhou visited, he left this inscription: "Cheer for the victorious construction of China's first large-scale hydropower station designed and equipped by ourselves!" This is truly something that Chinese people can be proud of.

So, are the power stations of Zhejiang Province just the Shuanglong Commune's power stations for small hydropower, and is the Xin'anjiang Power Station the only one for large hydropower? Of course not. It is understood that in Zhejiang Province, mountainous and semi-mountainous areas account for more than 70% of the province. There, streams are crisscrossed, and the water is rapid, with very rich hydropower resources. Even the old-fashioned water mills along the streams in various places number more than 15,000. If they are all transformed and hydropower stations are built, the rural areas of Zhejiang Province can increase the power by 100,000 horsepower. Now, in the mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of the province, a high tide of transforming old-fashioned water mills and building small power stations has been set off. Therefore, such small hydropower stations will soon appear in Zhejiang, like stars in the sky, blooming everywhere. As for large hydropower stations, even more magnificent spectacles will also appear in the near future. The most exciting thing is that the grand plan to generate 5 million kilowatts of electricity using the tidal range of the Qiantang River has also begun to be designed. Soon, the Jiangnan power grid will be shining everywhere, agriculture will be rapidly electrified, and industry will develop at a higher speed.

After inspecting the Shuanglong Commune and the Xin'anjiang Power Station this time, I have many thoughts. The main points are as follows: (1) Regarding the principle that the general line is the application and development of the mass line in socialist construction, my understanding was not deep enough. After this visit, I gained a deeper understanding. For example, a 4-kilowatt power station in the Shuanglong Commune was built by the Young Pioneers and is now managed by the Young Pioneers; another 24-kilowatt power station was built by women and is now managed by women. According to an engineer, the one-ridge eight-station, ten-reservoir connected hydropower system of this commune is a highly scientific design that even experts would find difficult to imagine, but it was a good method that the people themselves came up with. Another example is that for the concrete pouring project of the Xin'anjiang Power Station, according to world literature regulations, it can only be poured to a height of 1.5 meters each time, and it must be poured again after five days to a week. However, the workers of the Xin'anjiang Power Station emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, and created a record of pouring to a height of 33 meters in one go, and the quality was very good. Judging from these facts, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report pointed out that "China's general line for socialist construction has very rich content. Its starting point is: the people are the creators of history and the most active factor in the productive forces. The people are liberated from the old society and become masters under the socialist system, they can fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity, and make the production and construction get high-speed development." This conclusion is completely correct. (2) Regarding the correctness of the "walking on two legs" policy, I have gained a further understanding through this visit. Shuanglong Commune and Xin'anjiang are typical examples of the combination of large, medium, and small in hydropower generation. For example, the largest component of the turbine unit of the Xin'anjiang Power Station, there was no crane that could lift it. As a result, the workers came up with a local method to cooperate with the original crane for installation. This is one of the countless vivid examples of the combination of foreign and local methods in the construction of the Xin'anjiang Power Station. It is precisely because of the implementation of this policy that the hydropower cause can achieve a leapfrog development. I have further realized that the combination of foreign and local methods is indeed important, but the word "local" itself has a mass character, and it can mobilize the broad masses. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: A set of "walking on two legs" policies can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the Chinese people in an all-round way, coordinate with each other and make planned efforts from all aspects, concentrating on the cause of socialist construction. Facts have proved that this conclusion is completely correct.

(3) Although I had some experience in the past because I participated in labor in the commune for a period of time, I saw the unparalleled power of the people's commune more deeply this time after visiting the Shuanglong Commune and witnessing the miracle of the poor mountain village generating electricity and releasing light. (4) Regarding the fact that our country can accelerate the completion of socialism at the speed of the Great Leap Forward, I have also gained a further understanding from this visit. For example, the Shuanglong Commune has transformed from a poor commune into a rich commune in less than two years. Another example is that an engineering project like the Xin'anjiang Power Station would take seven years to complete in the United States, but it only takes two and a half years to complete in our country. All these examples cannot but make people deeply realize that our country's small solution in four years, the solution in seven years, and the big solution in ten years in agricultural modernization, and the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 ahead of schedule, and catching up with or exceeding the UK in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years, are all definitely achievable desires. After seeing these hydropower stations this time, I feel that under the socialist system, it is entirely possible and an objective inevitability to develop the national economy at the speed of the Great Leap Forward.

In short, after this visit, I deeply felt that the situation in the motherland is so good, and thousands of new things are constantly emerging, which is a situation of galloping horses and rapid progress. On the other hand, I also deeply feel that my own ideology is far behind the development of the situation, and I must strengthen self-transformation in order to catch up with the situation and be able to implement the general line well in actual action and make due contributions to the great cause of the motherland.

Through this visit, I deeply realized that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, found a set of our own unique experience suitable for building socialism in our country during the two-year Great Leap Forward, enriching the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. This is the whole set of experience in China's socialist construction summarized in the reports of the three vice premiers. This is an invaluable treasure for our country to build socialism, and it is a product of Mao Zedong Thought. Here, I further realize that the banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Seriously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future. I believe that with the leadership of our glorious and great Party and our wise and great Chairman Mao, the leap forward situation of our national economy will continue to develop; our socialist construction cause will surely advance from victory to victory; Lenin's famous formula: "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country" will surely be transformed from ideal into reality in our country at a faster rate than expected.

专栏：

    高速度向电气化进军
    金学成委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席的报告。李富春副总理和李先念副总理和谭震林副总理所作的报告，都是振奋人心的，我表示热烈的拥护。
    我最近到浙江省的金华和新安江视察了小型和大型的水力发电站，深深感到党的社会主义建设总路线的万丈光芒，不但照亮了城市，也照亮了乡村，不但促进了工业，也促进了农业和其他一切事业。同时也深深感到，在伟大的党和毛主席的正确领导下，总路线、人民公社和大跃进这三个法宝将继续发挥无比的威力，一定能把一穷二白的祖国加速建成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国，并且，一定能积极准备条件，加速实现人类最高理想共产主义社会。这里，让我简单地谈谈看到的水力发电站的兴建情况，并且谈谈我的一些感想。
    浙江金华城北有个人民公社，叫双龙公社，有六万人口，九万五千亩土地。这个公社地处山区，自古以来如果遇到山洪暴发，土地就被淹没，一二个月不下雨，就成旱灾。在解放前，那里的人民大多砍柴为生，靠一根扁担度日，他们说：“扁担头上挂布袋，一锅汤饭半锅菜”，生活很苦，真是个穷山沟。解放后，生产逐年发展，人民的生活也提高了不少，但是这个公社在刚成立时，比起其他的公社来，还是个穷社。公社成立后，党发出了一定要征服大自然，驯服双龙，为人民造福的伟大号召，在这个公社里，马上掀起了治山治水，兴建水库和水力发电站的群众运动。他们在整整一年内，日日夜夜劈山凿渠，使双龙泉、九龙泉和鹿田泉翻山越岭，汇合一起，从一百九十五米的高处，通过三百九十六米长的高压水管，形成巨大的冲力，虽仅有零点六的流量，而能带动七百五十瓩发电机发电，这就是这个公社里最初成立的双龙发电站。从此征服了大自然，小水成了大用，穷山沟发电放光明。社员们说：
    自古三水各东西，人民力量把溪移，
    流向东来移向西，流向西来望东移，
    三水合拢成一溪，小水带动大电机。
    接着，在1959年10月，党又指出必须向高速度电气化、机械化进军。这个公社又立刻发动群众，在五十天内建成了五个发电站，平均是十天建成一个。还有两个正在兴建中。这样，在这个公社内，共有八个电站，形成了一垄八站的电力网。同时，还以双龙水库为中心，把十个水库贯穿起来。于是就形成了一垄八站，十库相连，像长藤结瓜，做到了一水多用。
    从此，双龙公社既有电力网，又有灌溉网，使三万亩土地得到自流灌溉，此外像磨粉，锯木，做豆腐，副食品加工，人工降雨站，自来水站以及理发、切菜等等，也都使用了电力。耕地用的是电犁，老木犁进了博物馆。家家户户都装上了电灯。电力不仅给生产带来了巨大变化，它也给人们带来了新的生活。真是做到了：点灯不用油，耕地不用牛，灌溉自动流，吃穿不用愁。穷山沟的面貌迅速得到了改变，荒山变成万宝山，穷社也就成了富社。社员们都欢天喜地，他们说：
    党的领导造福万年，
    一垄八站，十库相连，
    治山又治水，灌溉又发电，
    真是双龙喜珠乐人间。
    除了这些小型水力发电站之外，我们也去参观了正在建筑中的新安江水力发电站，这是恰巧和双龙公社的一些小型发电站成为对照的大型发电站。等到这个发电站的工程全部完工，就可以向上海、南京、杭州、江西和皖南，大量供给廉价的电力，每度的成本不到半分钱（零点四八分）。这个发电站建成以后，江南地区就将以这个电站为中心，把这个地区所有的大型和小型、火力和水力的发电单位都贯穿起来，形成一个空前规模的江南发电网，对江南地区将发生极大的作用，至于像上海那样地方所长期不能解决的所谓“尖峰”供电问题，当然也可以得到解决。这个发电站的作用，不仅在于使工业更加发达，对农村现代化也将起极大的促进作用。正如建筑新安江发电站的英雄们所唱出的那首：
    高压电线拉，电架区区架，
    电线像蛛网，电架似高塔。
    建成发电站，发电能力大，
    工厂到农家，处处用到它。
    江西和皖南，宁沪杭地带，
    工业更发达，农业电气化。
    而且，这个发电站的经济效益，并不只是发电。它同时还可以蓄洪，可以消除新安江下游三十余万亩农田的水灾和旱灾；可以大量养鱼，可以通行，等到七里泷发电站建成以后，还可以通行三千吨的轮船。像这样的综合利用的水力发电站，全世界也是少有的。而且这个发电站的整个设计、制造、设备施工，全部是中国自己搞的。去年周总理去视察时，曾留下这样的题字：“为我国第一座自己设计和自制设备的大型水力发电站的胜利建设而欢呼！”这真是中国人足以自豪的事。
    那么，浙江省的小型水力发电站是否只有双龙公社的电站，大型水力发电站是否只有新安江电站呢？当然不是。据了解，在浙江省，山区和半山区的面积占全省70％以上，在那里，溪流纵横，水势湍急，水力资源非常丰富，即以各地沿溪的旧式水碓说，就有一万五千处以上，如果全部加以改造，建成水力发电站，浙江全省农村里就能增加有十万匹马力的动力。现在，全省山区和半山区，已经掀起了改造旧式水碓、兴建小型电站的高潮。所以这种小型水力发电站在浙江，不久就会出现满天星斗，遍地开花的局面。至于大型的水力发电站，同样也将在最近期内出现更加伟大的壮观。最令人兴奋的是，利用钱塘江潮差可以发电五百万瓩的宏伟计划，也已经着手设计。行见江南电力网，处处发红光，农业将迅速电气化，工业将以更高的速度向前发展。
    我这次视察了双龙公社和新安江发电站以后，有很多感想。主要有这样几点：（一）关于总路线是群众路线在社会主义建设中的运用和发展的道理，认识总不深刻，这次参观以后，得到了较深的体会。比如：双龙公社的一个四瓩的电站是少先队建成的，现在是少先队管理着；另一个二十四瓩的电站是妇女建成的，现在也是由妇女管理着。这个公社的一垄八站，十库相连的水力发电，据一个工程师亲口对我说：这是连专家都很难想像的具有高度科学性的设计，却是人民群众自己想出来的好办法。又比如：新安江电站的浇混凝土工程，按照世界文献规定，每次只能浇一米半的高度，并且必须隔五天至一星期才能再浇，可是新安江电站的工人，解放思想，破除迷信，创造了一口气浇三十三米高度的记录，而且质量很好。从这些事实看，李富春副总理报告中指出的“我国的社会主义建设总路线有着极丰富的内容。它的出发点是：人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力最活跃的因素。人民群众从旧社会解放出来，在社会主义制度下成为主人，就能够充分发挥积极性和创造性，使生产建设得到高速度的发展。”这个论断完全正确。（二）关于“两条腿走路”的方针的正确性，通过这次视察也有了进一步体会。双龙公社与新安江，是大中小结合在水力发电方面的典型事例。比如：新安江电站的水轮机的机组中最大部件，没有那么大的起重机可以起重，结果是工人们想出土办法配合原有的起重机来安装的。这是新安江电站建设工程中运用土洋结合的无数生动事例中的一个事例。正是由于这个方针的贯彻执行，才能使水力发电事业得到飞跃的发展。我更体会到，洋土结合，洋固然重要，但土字本身就有群众性，它能调动广大群众。李富春副总理报告中指出：一套“两条腿走路”的方针，可以把我国人民群众的积极性全面地充分地调动起来，互相协调地有计划地从各方面进行努力，集中到社会主义建设事业上面。这个论断，事实证明，完全正确。
    （三）关于人民公社是建设社会主义和过渡到共产主义的最好基层组织形式，过去虽也因为在公社里参加过一个时期的劳动而有一些体会，但这次视察了双龙公社，目睹穷山沟发电放光明的奇迹以后，更加深切地看到了人民公社的无比威力。（四）关于我国能以大跃进的速度加快建成社会主义，也由于这次视察而得到进一步的体会。比如：双龙公社仅仅在不足两年的时间内，就从一个穷社变成富社。又比如：像新安江电站那样的工程，如果在美国就需要七年才能完成，而在我们国家里却只需要两年半就能完成了。这一切事例，都不能不令人深深体会到，我国在农业现代化方面的四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决，提前实现1956年至1967年全国农业发展纲要，在工业的主要产品产量方面用比十年更少的时间赶上或超过英国，都是肯定可以实现的愿望。我这次看了这些水力发电站以后，感觉到：在社会主义制度下，用大跃进的速度发展国民经济，是完全可能的是客观的必然性。
    总之，这次视察以后，使我深深感到，祖国的形势是太好了，万千新事物不断涌现，是万马奔腾，突飞猛进的形势。另一方面，也深深感到，自己的思想意识远远落后于形势的发展，必须加强自我改造，才能赶上形势，才能很好地在实际行动中贯彻总路线，为祖国的伟大事业作出应有的贡献。
    我通过视察，深切地体会到，我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，在两年大跃进中找到了一套我们自己的独特的适合我国建设社会主义的经验，丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。这就是三位副总理的报告所总结起来的我国社会主义建设的一整套经验。这是我国建设社会主义的无价之宝，这是毛泽东思想的产物。在此，使我更加体会到，毛泽东思想的旗帜，就是胜利的旗帜。认真学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是我们在今后取得愈来愈大的胜利的根本保证。我相信，我们有光荣伟大的党和英明伟大的毛主席的领导，我国国民经济的跃进局面必将持续地发展下去；我国社会主义建设事业必将从胜利走向胜利；列宁所说的著名公式：“共产主义是苏维埃政权加全国电气化”，在我们国家里必将以较预想快得多的速度，由理想变成现实。
