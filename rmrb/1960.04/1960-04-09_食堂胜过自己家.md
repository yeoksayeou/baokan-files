    The Dining Hall is Better Than Home
    A commune member said: Returning from labor, we enter the dining hall, the dining hall's food is fragrant, picking up the bowl, we think of the Party, our whole body fills with strength.
    Speech by Delegate Wei Maowen:
    Fellow delegates,
    I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I will resolutely implement them. Now, I would like to report to the congress on the situation of rural public dining halls in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.
    In the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, before and after the people's communes were established, tens of thousands of rural public dining halls emerged in Qiannan Autonomous Prefecture. As soon as rural public dining halls appeared, they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers of all ethnic groups. Over the past year, the masses of commune members of all ethnic groups have increasingly and profoundly felt the benefits brought to them by the public dining halls from their personal experiences, and they have become more and more fond of and concerned about the dining halls; with the rapid development of production and the continuous rectification and improvement of the dining halls, rural public dining halls have become increasingly consolidated. At present, there are more than 14,700 public dining halls in the prefecture, with the number of participants accounting for more than 98% of the total rural population. The dining halls are becoming more and more consolidated and better, and a number of well-run advanced dining halls have emerged. The Yongyin Dining Hall of the Quanmin Production Team of the Xincheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Duyun City is one of them. Below, I would like to focus on the situation of this dining hall.
    The Quanmin Production Team has a total of 61 households (57 Buyi households and 4 Miao households), with 328 people. Before the communization and during the advanced cooperative, in order to meet the needs of the increasing development of production, under the initiative of Yang Shangrong, the secretary of the Party branch, a farm-busy season cooking group was organized here. The method of rotating cooking was adopted, which saved labor and played a good role in promoting production. In the situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the scale of collective production expanded, and the desire of commune members to expand the farm-busy season cooking group and make it permanent became even more urgent. The Quanmin Production Team Dining Hall (i.e., Yongyin Dining Hall) was thus created at the active request of the broad masses of commune members.
      Planned Use of Grain, Diversified Food
    After the establishment of the Yongyin Dining Hall, under the leadership of the Party, the principle of "actively running well, voluntary participation" was resolutely implemented, planned grain use was implemented, and farm-busy and farm-slack grain use plans were democratically formulated and implemented, so as to diversify food, so that commune members could eat their fill, eat well, hygienically, and economically. The dining hall ensured that commune members always had boiled water to drink and hot water to use. In short, everything started from being conducive to production and facilitating commune members. Special care was given to the elderly, children, patients, pregnant women, and lying-in women: for the elderly, soft rice was cooked for the three daily meals; for patients and pregnant women, food suitable to their tastes was prepared; for lying-in women, the dining hall also provided pork and glutinous rice and other nutritious foods. Buyi commune member Luo Fangzhi gave birth to twins, and the dining hall gave double the care; rice cakes were also made for the children during festivals. In addition, care was also given to the relatives and friends of the commune members. No wonder the masses universally reflected: "The dining hall is better than their own home," "Living in the dining hall, adults and children are happy." The masses boasted that their own dining hall achieved three goods (good food, good production, good relationship between cadres and the masses), four satisfactions (satisfaction for those who went to work, the elderly, children, and guests), and six cares (caring for the elderly, children, pregnant women, lying-in women, patients, and guests). Because of the above, the life of the commune members has been greatly facilitated, and the public dining hall has become a warm family for the people of all ethnic groups here.
    The dining hall is well run, and the enthusiasm of the commune members is getting greater and greater. The commune members said: "Returning from labor, we enter the dining hall, the dining hall's food is fragrant, picking up the bowl, we think of the Party, our whole body fills with strength." In particular, women commune members, due to the good running of the dining halls and nurseries and other welfare undertakings, have been liberated from the cumbersome housework and have become a fresh force on the production front. This team has a total of 97 female laborers, accounting for 62.8% of the team's labor force. The vast majority of them used to be often absent from work due to heavy housework and the burden of children. Now with the dining halls and nurseries, they are concentrating on production with "no two worries," and the attendance rate has increased from about 80% to more than 98%, and labor efficiency has increased by an average of 30% to 50%. Woman commune member Li Shiying was freed from the heavy housework of a family of seven, and she was happy to engage in production, and the family relationship became more harmonious. With infinite joy, she said: "I have been liberated for the second time!". Due to the further liberation of women's labor force and their investment in production, the team's production has been greatly developed, coupled with other factors of increased production, the team's total agricultural and sideline output value in 1959 doubled that of 1958, and the total income per capita reached more than 140 yuan, and every household increased its income. The living standards of commune members have been significantly improved, exceeding the level of the local well-to-do middle peasants in the past.
    The Public Dining Hall Becomes the Center of Activities for Commune Members
    The dining room of the public dining hall has naturally become a place for commune members to carry out activities. Whether it is for learning, meetings, or cultural and recreational activities, they are held here, which saves time and facilitates the masses. Both cadres and the masses are satisfied. The dining hall has become a "three-in-one" dining hall, meeting hall, and classroom, and the dining hall has become the center of political, economic, and cultural activities of the production team. For more than a year, the commune members of the Quanmin Production Team have used the dining hall as a classroom and used the rest time before and after meals to persist in amateur cultural learning and eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. At the same time, collective life has cultivated good habits of cleanliness and hygiene among commune members. Through activities such as eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, everyone now has a face towel, everyone has a toothbrush, and they often change clothes and take baths, so the disease has been greatly reduced, and everyone is healthy. The dining hall has not only promoted the great development of production but also promoted the all-round leap forward of cultural, educational, and health undertakings.
    The reason why the Yongyin Dining Hall is well run is mainly due to the leadership of the Party, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, following the mass line, relying on the masses, and implementing democratic management. Cadres participate in the dining hall and lead the dining hall. All cadres who come to the production team to assist in the work participate in eating in the dining hall. Cadres and the masses live together, which further close the relationship between each other, and at the same time, the work of the dining hall is constantly improved and improved. Since its establishment, the Yongyin Dining Hall has democratically elected those Party members, League members, and activists from poor and lower-middle peasants who are loved by the masses to form a dining hall management committee to take charge of cooking work, and the director is the secretary of the Party branch. The dining hall implements democratic management; and has a sound financial management system, all income and expenditure are recorded in books, paid with vouchers, property is registered, accounts are cleared monthly, financial income and expenditure and grain surplus are settled at the end of the month, and regularly posted. The dining hall has also established an opinion box. In this way, everyone cares about the dining hall and loves the dining hall, and the Yongyin Dining Hall is getting better and better.
    Due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership and political and ideological education, the management personnel and cooks of the Yongyin Dining Hall regard the work of serving the commune members as a glorious cause, and wholeheartedly work for the dining hall and arrange the lives of the commune members. They have made achievements in cooking utensil innovation and technology reform, improved the continuous pot stove, created a vegetable cutting machine, etc., which reduced labor intensity and improved labor productivity.
    In addition, the Yongyin Dining Hall also actively develops production and established a family fortune. They planted more than 30 mu and more than 40 kinds of vegetables, raised pigs and poultry. In addition to achieving self-sufficiency in non-staple food, they also sold 24 large fat pigs to the state last year to support socialist construction.
    The establishment and consolidation and development of the Yongyin Dining Hall is not smooth sailing and without struggle. Some people have tried to criticize and attack it in every possible way, saying that "the dining hall is not free," "too many pigs have no good bran, too many people have no good food," and so on. They demanded "decentralization" (cooking by households), in an attempt to dismantle the dining hall. The vast majority of commune members, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly opposed it, saying: "'Decentralization', we will never do it; those who do not participate, do as you please." In this way, the attempt of a few people to destroy the dining hall was completely shattered, and the dining hall insisted on running it. The public dining hall has withstood the test and played a great role in promoting production and consolidating and developing the people's commune. There is no doubt that in the future it will continue to play its huge role more and more.
    In 1959, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, under the brilliant light of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the people of all ethnic groups in our state conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and realized the continued leap forward in agricultural production. The total grain output increased by 19.5% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958. 1960 is a year of continued Great Leap Forward. At present, the people of all ethnic groups in the state are engaged in spring plowing production on a large scale. We are determined to, under the leadership of the Party, grasp production with one hand and life with the other. While seizing agricultural production, we will further run all the public dining halls in the state well, organize the lives of the masses well, set off a new upsurge of agricultural production movement, and strive to complete and over fulfill the 1960 national economic plan!

    食堂胜过自己家
    社员说：劳动归来进食堂，食堂饭菜喷喷香，端起饭来想起党，浑身上下添力量。
    韦茂文代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和人大常务委员会的工作报告，并一定要坚决贯彻执行。现在，我就黔南布依族苗族自治州农村公共食堂的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    黔南自治州在1958年大跃进的新形势下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在人民公社化前后，涌现出了数以万计的农村公共食堂。农村公共食堂一出现，就受到了广大各族农民群众的热烈欢迎。一年多来，各族社员群众从自己切身生活的体验中，越来越深刻地感到公共食堂给他们带来的好处，更加爱护和关心食堂；随着生产的迅速发展和食堂的不断整顿、改进，农村公共食堂日益得到巩固。目前，全州共有一万四千七百多个公共食堂，参加的人数占农村总人数的98％以上。食堂越办越巩固，越办越好，并出现了一批办得较好的先进食堂。都匀市郊区新城人民公社全民生产队壅引食堂，就是当中的一个。下面，我想着重地谈一下这个食堂的情况。
    全民生产队共六十一户（布依族五十七户、苗族四户），三百二十八人。在公社化以前、高级社时，为了适应生产日益发展的需要，在党支部书记杨尚荣同志的倡议下，这里就组织起了农忙煮饭组。采取轮流煮饭的办法，节省了劳动力，对促进生产起了很好的作用。在1958年大跃进的形势下，生产集体化的规模扩大了，社员群众要求扩大农忙煮饭组，并把它常年固定下来的愿望就更加迫切。全民生产队食堂（即壅引食堂）就是这样在广大社员群众的积极要求下产生的。
      用粮有计划　饭菜多样化
    壅引食堂建立以后，在党的领导下，坚决贯彻了“积极办好，自愿参加”的原则，实行了计划用粮，民主制订并实行了农忙、农闲的用粮计划，做到饭菜多样化，使社员既吃得饱、吃得好，又卫生，又节约。食堂做到了使社员经常有开水喝，有热水用。总之，一切从有利生产、方便社员出发。对于老人、小孩、病号、孕妇和产妇等都专有照顾：日常三餐，为老年人煮软饭；为病人、孕妇做适合他（她）们口味的饭菜；对于产妇，食堂还照顾猪肉和糯米等富于营养的食物。布依族社员罗仿芝一胎双生，食堂还给了双分的照顾；逢年过节还为小孩做米耙。此外，对社员来往的亲友，也有所照顾。无怪群众普遍地反映说：“食堂胜过自己的家”，“在食堂过日子，大人小孩都幸福。”群众夸耀他们自己的食堂做到了三好（吃得好、生产好、干部群众关系好）、四满意（出工干活的人满意、老年人、小孩和客人满意）、六照顾（照顾老人、小孩、孕妇、产妇和病人、客人）。由于做到了以上这些，给社员群众的生活带来了很大的方便，公共食堂成了这里各族人民温暖的大家庭。
    食堂办得好，社员群众的干劲越干越大。社员们说：“劳动归来进食堂，食堂饭菜喷喷香，端起碗来想起党，浑身上下添力量。”特别是妇女社员，由于办好了食堂和托儿所等福利事业，已经从繁琐的家务劳动中解放了出来，成为生产战线上的一支生力军。这个队共有九十七个妇女劳力，占全队劳动力的62.8％。其中绝大多数过去都因为繁重的家务和孩子的拖累而常误工、旷工。现在有了食堂和托儿所，她们“心无二挂”专心搞生产，出勤率由原来的80％左右增加到98％以上，劳动效率平均提高了30％到50％。妇女社员李时英从七口之家的繁重家务中解脱出来，称心如意地搞生产，家庭关系也变得更加和睦相亲。她怀着无限欢乐的心情说：“我是第二次得到解放！”。由于妇女劳动力的进一步解放，投入生产，促使全队的生产获得很大的发展，再加上其他方面的增产因素，这个队1959年农副业总产值比1958年翻了一番，总收入按人平均每人达一百四十多元，户户都增加了收入。社员的生活水平显著提高，超过了过去当地富裕中农的水平。
    公共食堂成了社员活动的中心场所
    公共食堂的饭厅很自然地成了社员进行活动的场所，无论学习、开会或者搞文娱活动都在这里举行，既节省了时间，又方便了群众，干部和群众都感到满意。食堂变成了食堂、会堂、课堂“三堂合一”，食堂成为生产队政治、经济、文化活动的中心场所。一年多以来，全民生产队的社员利用食堂作课堂，利用饭前饭后的休息时间，坚持了业余文化学习，扫除了青壮年文盲。同时，集体生活培养了社员爱清洁、讲卫生的良好习惯，通过除四害、讲卫生等活动，现在人人有面巾，个个有牙刷，经常换衣、洗澡，因而疾病大大减少，人人身体健康。食堂不仅促进了生产的大发展，而且促进了文教卫生事业的全面跃进。
    壅引食堂之所以办得好，主要是由于在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅、走群众路线、依靠群众、实行民主管理。干部参加食堂，领导食堂。凡是到生产队协助工作的干部都一律参加食堂吃饭。干部和群众同生活，更加密切了相互间的关系，同时食堂工作也因此不断地得到改进和提高。壅引食堂从成立起，就民主选举了那些为群众爱戴的党团员和贫农、下中农积极分子组成食堂管理委员会，担任炊事工作，主任是党支部书记。食堂实行民主管理；并且有较健全的财务管理制度，一切收支做到收有簿，付有据，财产有登记，账目月月清，财务收支、粮食节余月终结算，定期张榜公布。食堂并建立了意见箱。这样，人人关心食堂、热爱食堂，壅引食堂越办越好。
    由于加强了党的领导和政治思想教育工作，壅引食堂的管理人员和炊事人员都把为社员服务的工作当作光荣的事业，全心全意地为食堂工作，为社员安排生活。他们在搞炊具革新和改革技术方面做出了成绩，改进了连锅灶，创造了切菜机等，减轻了劳动强度，提高了劳动生产率。
    此外，壅引食堂还积极发展生产，建立了家底。他们种了三十多亩、四十多种蔬菜，养猪并饲养家禽。除做到副食自给以外，去年还卖了二十四头大肥猪给国家，支援社会主义建设。
    壅引食堂的建立和巩固发展，并不是一帆风顺、没有斗争的。有的人对它曾经百般地加以非难和攻击，说什么“食堂不自由”，“猪多无好糠，人多无好食”，如此等等。他们要求“下放”（分户煮饭），企图拆散食堂。绝大多数社员群众特别是贫农和下中农，则坚决反对，他们说：“‘下放’，我们坚决不干；不参加的，听便。”就这样，少数人企图搞垮食堂的打算彻底地破灭了，食堂坚持办下来了。公共食堂经受住了考验，对促进生产、巩固和发展人民公社起了很大的作用。毫无疑问，今后它将越来越大地继续发挥它的巨大的作用。
    1959年，我州各族人民在党中央、毛主席和国务院的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，认真贯彻执行农业
  “八字宪法”，实现了农业生产的继续跃进，粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增长19.5％。1960年是继续大跃进的一年。目前全州各族人民正在大搞春耕生产，我们坚决在党的领导下，一手抓生产，一手抓生活，在抓紧农业生产的同时，把全州所有的公共食堂进一步办好，组织好群众生活，掀起农业生产运动的新高潮，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗！
