Xinhua News Agency, Athens, April 6th: The Greek Committee for the Defense of Democratic Freedoms has issued an appeal to the World Federation of Trade Unions and other domestic and foreign trade union organizations, protesting the Greek government's interrogation of Greek citizens under Decree No. 375.

The Greek "Dawn Daily" reported that a group of democratic women sent an appeal to the Women's International Democratic Federation, protesting the charges imposed on them. The Greek judicial authorities cited the fact that these women attended the Women's International Democratic Federation Congress and representative meetings of democratic groups in other countries as "evidence" to accuse them of "espionage."
