Buying a pair of shoes, to get the length and width right, always involves trying on several pairs repeatedly, which wastes the customer's time and affects the work efficiency of the shoe store clerk. Employees of the Qingdao State-Owned Department Store have created an electric shoe-fitting device. When customers enter, they simply place their foot on the electric shoe-fitting device, and the indicator light will tell the salesperson the size. According to the indicated size, the salesperson can find shoes that fit the customer at once, which is convenient for the customer and saves the salesperson's time.

    自动试鞋器
    买双鞋子，长短肥瘦合适，总不免要反复试上好几双，既耽误顾客的时间，也影响鞋店售货员的工作效率。青岛市国营百货公司的职工们，制成了一种电动试鞋器。顾客进门，只消把足往电动试鞋器上一放，上面的指示灯就把尺码告诉售货员了。售货员根据指示的尺码，一次就可以找到适合顾客穿的鞋子，既方便了顾客，又节省了售货员的时间。
