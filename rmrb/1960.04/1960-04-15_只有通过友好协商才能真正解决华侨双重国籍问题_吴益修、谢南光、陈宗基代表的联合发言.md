Comrades Chairman, Fellow Representatives:

We fully agree with and support the three reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee.

We would now like to make a joint statement on the issue of Overseas Chinese possessing dual nationality of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia. As Overseas Chinese representatives, we deeply understand the feelings of Overseas Chinese, especially since many of our relatives and friends are Overseas Chinese with dual nationality. Therefore, we have a greater understanding of their demands and hopes. We know that the people of the whole country are extremely concerned about Overseas Chinese residing abroad, including those with dual nationality.

We believe that properly resolving the dual nationality issue existing between our country and the Republic of Indonesia is of great significance for promoting friendly relations between our two countries. When our country and the Republic of Indonesia signed the treaty on dual nationality, Overseas Chinese abroad, like the people at home, expressed warm support and hoped that the treaty would come into effect and be implemented as soon as possible. In his letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on December 9 last year, Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi put forward three suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the Indonesian Overseas Chinese issue. The first suggestion was that the two governments immediately exchange instruments of ratification for the treaty on dual nationality and send representatives to form a joint committee. We are pleased that the two governments exchanged instruments of ratification in Beijing on January 20 this year, and a joint committee composed of representatives of the two countries was established in Jakarta on January 25 to discuss and stipulate the implementation measures for the dual nationality treaty and various issues related to the implementation of this treaty. The Joint Committee has held several meetings since its establishment. We hope that both parties can reach an agreement through consultation as soon as possible. However, it is surprising that while the Joint Committee was still in consultation, the Indonesian government announced the entry into force of Government Regulation No. 20, which the Indonesian government unilaterally formulated as early as June 1959 regarding the implementation of the dual nationality treaty, in the form of Government Regulation No. 11 of 1960. Indonesian authorities in some places have recently forced Overseas Chinese with dual nationality to make a choice of nationality within a short period of time, forcing some people they consider useful and technically skilled to choose Indonesian nationality, otherwise threatening them with dismissal and other means of persecution. This practice has not only been widely opposed by Overseas Chinese with dual nationality, but also clearly violates the spirit and principles of the dual nationality treaty, and is also inconsistent with international practice. The Chinese government will not interfere with the Indonesian government's formulation of its own domestic laws. However, Government Regulation No. 20 of 1959 is a regulation concerning the implementation of the treaty on dual nationality between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia. Since the treaty was signed by the governments of the two countries, the treaty is binding on the governments of both countries, and the governments of both countries should jointly undertake the international obligations to implement this treaty. According to the provisions of the treaty and the exchange of letters, the two parties should jointly study and stipulate the measures for the implementation of the treaty. There is no reason to state that one party can independently engage in a set of implementation measures on its own. The Indonesian authorities' unilateral activities in selecting nationality cannot solve any problems, but can only create more difficult obstacles in resolving the dual nationality issue, making the resolution of the issue more complicated and hindering the implementation of the treaty. We hope that this situation can be changed, and that the Joint Committee will jointly formulate measures for the implementation of the dual nationality treaty in the spirit of friendly consultation and smoothly implement it; only through friendly consultation can the dual nationality issue of Overseas Chinese be truly resolved.

The most fundamental spirit of the dual nationality treaty is to allow Overseas Chinese with dual nationality to choose their nationality smoothly in accordance with the principle of voluntary choice. Some of us have lived in Indonesia for a long time in the past, and Overseas Chinese with dual nationality were originally willing to choose Indonesian nationality. Because they have settled in Indonesia for generations, living, producing, and working together with the local people, and jointly opposing colonialism and striving for national independence, they have made contributions in politics, economy, and culture, and thus have formed a close relationship with the local people and have deep feelings for Indonesia, regarding Indonesia as their hometown. This is very natural. Many of them are willing to choose Indonesian nationality, which is completely reasonable and understandable. The Chinese government has always respected, understood, and supported their wishes. We believe that the Indonesian government should also respect their wishes. The Chinese government and people are willing to see Overseas Chinese with dual nationality choose Indonesian nationality in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere based on the principle of voluntariness, become non-discriminated citizens of Indonesia, and continue to contribute to Indonesia's national independence and economic prosperity. This is not only beneficial to themselves and to Indonesia, but also helps to promote friendly relations between the two countries.

However, what makes us indignant is that influential groups in Indonesia, based on their political purposes, have launched large-scale and comprehensive anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities, inciting national chauvinistic sentiments, and persecuting Overseas Chinese on a large scale. These anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities are still continuing. At the same time, many situations have emerged in Indonesia that make Overseas Chinese with dual nationality feel uneasy. In the wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, small vendors among them have also been forced to close their businesses in some places. Their due rights to business and employment are restricted. Anti-Chinese elements in rural areas also create an atmosphere of harassment and terror, using extortion to force them to leave. The educational rights of their children are also restricted, and schools run by themselves are prohibited from teaching Chinese courses. In some places, there have even been phenomena of forced marriages of Overseas Chinese women with dual nationality, and even forcing them to change their names. In short, they suffer many exclusions in economic, cultural, and other aspects, their personality is subjected to various insults, and their self-esteem is severely damaged. They see that even if they choose Indonesian nationality, they cannot avoid the misfortune of being discriminated against and persecuted. In such a situation, how can they not feel panic and cold? How can they truly choose freely on the issue of nationality according to the principle of voluntariness? Isn't it out of desperation that more and more of them are asking to return to China? If Overseas Chinese with dual nationality are persecuted and excluded, unable to make a living, or are discriminated against and unwilling to continue living in Indonesia and ask to return to China, our strong socialist motherland, where all ethnic groups are equal and friendly, of course welcomes them. The motherland government will definitely give them a warm reception and proper resettlement. We believe that after they come back, they will also contribute to socialist construction like the people at home.

The friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples is eternal. For the sake of friendly relations between the two countries, we hope that the Indonesian government will immediately stop anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities, and at the same time stop the exclusionary behavior against Overseas Chinese with dual nationality, respect their rights and personality, so that they can live in Indonesia with peace of mind, and so that they can express their willingness to choose their nationality in a friendly atmosphere. This will enable the issue of Overseas Chinese with dual nationality to be properly resolved, thereby contributing to a comprehensive and rational solution to the Overseas Chinese issue, and enabling the friendly relations between the two countries to be maintained and developed.

### 只有通过友好协商才能真正解决华侨双重国籍问题  吴益修、谢南光、陈宗基代表的联合发言

    只有通过友好协商才能真正解决华侨双重国籍问题
    吴益修、谢南光、陈宗基代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理所作的三个报告以及常务委员会的工作报告。
    我们现在想就具有中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国双重国籍的华侨的问题作一个联合发言。作为华侨代表，我们更加深切体会到华侨的心情，尤其因为我们的亲友中有许多是具有双重国籍的华侨，因此我们对他们的要求和希望了解的较多。我们知道全国人民对侨居国外的华侨，包括具有双重国籍的华侨都是极为关怀的。
    我们认为妥善解决存在于我国和印度尼西亚共和国之间的双重国籍问题，对于促进我们两国之间的友好关系有着重大的意义。当我国和印度尼西亚共和国签订了双重国籍问题的条约时，国外华侨同国内人民一样，表示热烈的拥护，并且希望尽早地使条约生效，付诸实施。我国陈毅外交部长在去年12月9日致印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约的信件，提出了全面解决印度尼西亚华侨问题的三项建议，第一项就提出两国政府立即交换关于双重国籍问题的条约的批准书，同时派出代表组织联合委员会。我们高兴的是，两国政府已经在今年1月20日在北京互换了条约的批准书，并且在1月25日在雅加达成立了两国代表组成的联合委员会，讨论和规定双重国籍问题条约的实施办法和有关执行这一条约的各项问题。联合委员会成立以来，已经召开了多次会议。我们希望双方通过协商能够尽早地取得协议。但是令人惊讶的是，就在联合委员会还在协商期间，印度尼西亚政府就以1960年第十一号政府条例的形式，宣布了印度尼西亚政府早在1959年6月单方面制定的、有关实施双重国籍问题的条约的第二十号政府条例生效。一些地方的印度尼西亚当局最近还强迫具有双重国籍的华侨在短期内进行选籍，逼迫一些他们认为有用的和有技术的人选择印度尼西亚国籍，否则就以解雇及其它迫害手段进行威胁。这种做法不仅已经遭到具有双重国籍的华侨的普遍反对，而且显然是违背双重国籍问题的条约的精神和原则的，同时也是不符合国际惯例的。印度尼西亚政府制定自己的国内法我国政府是不会去干涉的。但是1959年第二十号政府条例却是有关实施中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约的条例。条约既是两国政府签订的，条约对两国政府都有约束力，两国政府都应该共同承担执行这一条约的国际义务。根据条约和换文的规定，应该由双方共同研究和规定对条约实施的办法，没有任何理由说明单方面可以自己单独搞一套实施办法。印度尼西亚当局片面进行选籍的活动是不能解决任何问题的，只能在解决双重国籍问题上制造更加困难的障碍，使问题的解决更加复杂化，妨碍条约的实施。我们希望这种情况能有所改变，由联合委员会本着友好协商的精神共同制订出实施双重国籍问题条约的办法，并顺利地付诸实施；也只有通过友好协商，才能真正解决华侨双重国籍问题。
    双重国籍问题的条约的最根本精神就是要让具有双重国籍的华侨根据本人自愿原则顺利地进行选籍。我们有的人过去曾经长期在印度尼西亚居住过，具有双重国籍的华侨本来是愿意选择印度尼西亚国籍的。因为他们已是世世代代在印度尼西亚定居，和当地人民共同生活、共同生产劳动、共同反对殖民主义争取民族独立，不论在政治、经济、文化上都作了贡献，因而和当地人民结成了血肉相连的关系，对印度尼西亚产生了深厚的感情，把印度尼西亚看作自己的家乡。这是很自然的。他们当中的许多人愿意选择印度尼西亚国籍，这也是完全合乎情理的，可以理解的。对他们的这种愿望我国政府一向是尊重、谅解和赞助的。我们认为印度尼西亚政府也应当尊重他们的这种愿望。我国政府和人民愿意看到具有双重国籍的华侨能够在和平友好的气氛下根据自愿原则选择印度尼西亚国籍，成为印度尼西亚的不受歧视的公民，而对印度尼西亚的民族独立事业和经济繁荣继续作出贡献。这样不仅对他们本身和对印度尼西亚来说都是有利的，而且也有助于促进两国的友好关系。
    可是令我们感到愤慨的是，印度尼西亚的有势力集团基于他们的政治目的，却大规模地全面地掀起了反华排华活动，煽动民族沙文主义情绪，大肆迫害华侨。这种反华排华活动目前还在继续进行。与此同时，在印度尼西亚还出现了许多使具有双重国籍的华侨感到不安的情况。在排华的浪潮中，他们中的小商贩在一些地方也被迫停业。他们的营业和就业的应有权利受到限制。排华分子在农村中还制造骚扰恐怖气氛，以敲诈勒索的手段来将他们逼走。他们的子女的就学权利也受到限制，自己办的学校也被禁止教授华文课程。某些地方还发生对双重国籍的华侨妇女进行逼婚的现象，甚至逼他们改名换姓。总之他们在经济文化等方面遭受许多排斥，他们的人格受到种种的侮辱，他们的自尊心也受到严重的损伤。他们看到就是选择了印度尼西亚国籍也不能免掉被歧视与迫害的厄运。在这样的情况下，怎么能不使他们感到恐慌和寒心呢？他们又怎么能够在国籍问题上真正按照自愿的原则自由地选择呢？他们当中越来越多的人要求回到中国来，难道不是迫不得已的吗？具有双重国籍的华侨如果遭受到迫害和排斥，无法谋生或者是遭到歧视不愿继续在印度尼西亚居住而要求回到中国来，我们强大的、各族人民平等友爱的社会主义祖国当然是欢迎的。祖国政府一定会给予他们以热情的接待和妥善的安置。我们相信，他们回来以后，也一定会同国内人民一样为社会主义建设作出贡献。
    我国人民和印度尼西亚人民的友谊是永恒的。为了两国的友好关系，我们希望印度尼西亚政府立即停止反华排华活动，同时停止对具有双重国籍的华侨的排斥行为，尊重他们的权益和人格，使他们能够在印度尼西亚安心居住下去，使他们能够在一个友好的气氛下表达自己的自愿来进行选择国籍。这样才能使具有双重国籍的华侨的问题得到妥善的解决。从而有利于全面和合理的解决华侨问题，使两国的友好关系能够得到维护和发展。
