Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th. News from Seoul: In recent days, the people of Seoul have eagerly donated money and blood to comfort and support students and citizens wounded by the Syngman Rhee's puppet military and police in the anti-American, anti-Syngman Rhee struggle.

However, the inhuman Syngman Rhee clique is brutally using knives and guns to intimidate them, obstructing them from giving blood transfusions to the wounded masses.

During the Seoul people's demonstration on April 19, the Syngman Rhee clique dispatched a large number of military police to carry out a bloody massacre. At least one hundred and twenty-eight demonstrators were killed by Syngman Rhee's puppet military and police, and seven hundred and seventy-seven were wounded.

According to Toyo News Agency reports, these wounded people need a large number of blood transfusions due to excessive blood loss, but the blood reserves of Seoul's hospitals have been exhausted. In recent days, many citizens have flocked to the entrances of various hospitals to donate blood for the wounded, but the obstruction of the Syngman Rhee military police has prevented the injured from receiving blood transfusions, resulting in continuous deaths.

    支援反美反李斗争中英勇负伤同胞
    汉城人民踊跃捐款、输血
    新华社平壤25日电　汉城消息：汉城人民连日踊跃捐款、输血慰问和支援在反美反李斗争中被李伪军警打伤的学生和市民。
    但是，残无人道的李承晚集团竟灭绝人性地用刀枪恫吓他们，阻挠他们给受伤群众输血。
    4月19日汉城人民示威中，李承晚集团调来大批军警进行血腥的屠杀。示威人民被李伪军警打死的至少有一百二十八名，被打伤的有七百七十七名。
    据东洋通讯社报道，这些负伤的人因失血过多，需要大量输血，但是汉城各医院的存血已经用完。近几天内，各医院门口都涌来许多市民为伤员输血，但是，由于李伪宪兵和警察的阻止，使受伤者无法得到输血，因而不断有人死去。
