The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation jointly sent a telegram to the Youth and Sports Committee of the Algerian National Liberation Front and the General Union of Algerian Muslim Students, representing the Chinese youth and students in expressing firm support for the Algerian people and youth in their armed struggle against French colonialism supported by the United States.

In a telegram to the African Youth Council, the All-China Youth Federation said: "The people and youth of West Africa have exposed the various deceptions of French colonialists, resolutely oppose imperialism, and demand genuine independence and full sovereignty. We firmly support your just struggle."

The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation also jointly sent telegrams or letters to youth and student organizations in Iraq, Lebanon, Cyprus, India, Japan, Burma, Nepal, Indonesia, Ceylon, Ethiopia, Sudan, the United Arab Republic, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritius, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Gabon, Upper Volta, Madagascar, Morocco, Mauritania, Congo, Niger, Central African Republic, Senegal, Togo, Reunion, Tunisia, Chad, Martinique, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, British Guiana, Suriname, British Honduras, Puerto Rico, Tanganyika, Uganda, Zanzibar and other countries and regions, extending warm and heartfelt respects to them. In these letters and telegrams, the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation warmly hailed the great contributions made by the youth of various countries in the struggle against colonialism and for national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: More than 1,500 youth representatives from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting at the Tsinghua University Auditorium tonight to solemnly commemorate April 24th, "Anti-Colonialism Day." The telegram adopted at the meeting emphasized that the day of the complete burial of imperialism and colonialism is not far away. 130 million Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, fully support the just struggle of the people and youth of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism.

The meeting was conducted in a strong atmosphere of unity against imperialism.

Yang Jingren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that as long as the people and youth of Asian, African, and Latin American countries strengthen unity, persevere in struggle, heighten vigilance, are not incited to discord by imperialism, and do not harbor illusions about imperialism, they will surely win the final victory of the national independence movement and will completely, cleanly, and thoroughly bury the heinous imperialist and colonialist system. He said: In the excellent situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is thriving, and the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, achieving one major victory after another. The Asian, African, and Latin American people who are united and persistent in their struggle are invincible and fearless new forces. Their struggle plays a great role in fundamentally shaking the imperialist system. The seemingly powerful and outwardly strong but inwardly weak imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. No conspiracy or trick of imperialism can save it from its inevitable collapse and demise. In his speech, he extended his highest respect on behalf of the Chinese youth to the youth of Asian, African, and Latin American countries who are engaged in heroic struggles against imperialism and colonialism and for the struggle to win and safeguard national independence.

Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, said in his speech that the current excellent situation is unprecedentedly favorable for the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence. We must advance victoriously and carry out unremitting struggles for greater victories. Chinese students are willing to join hands with students from Asian, African, and Latin American countries to hold even higher the banner of the Bandung Spirit, strengthen unity, persevere in struggle, and contribute all our strength to the complete victory of the struggle to win and safeguard national independence, oppose imperialism and colonialism, and defend world peace.

Filzioui Abdelhamid, representative of the Algerian youth delegation, said at the meeting that French colonialists, regardless of the will of the people of African countries, are waging war on our land. It is obvious that this is to prevent the huge liberation movement in Africa and threaten the security of the African people. Under these circumstances, we have to adopt the form of armed struggle, and the Algerian people should be the masters of their own destiny. He said that as long as colonialism has not been eliminated, it is impossible to imagine true peace.

Aloys Mali, head of the Cameroon youth delegation and propaganda secretary of the Cameroon Democratic Youth Union, said that the great achievements made by the Chinese people and youth in building their motherland eloquently prove that the people of countries that have achieved national independence can create miracles. The colonial system means poverty and ignorance. Our struggle for complete and genuine independence will continue until final victory.

Aloys Mali then read out the congratulatory message from the Cameroon Democratic Youth Union to the meeting. The congratulatory message stated, "We are determined to fight to protect mankind from barbaric crimes, to protect the future of our people, and to build a new Cameroon. Final victory belongs to us. We wish the sincere and unbreakable friendship between us will continue to be consolidated and developed." Amid thunderous applause, he presented a flag to the All-China Youth Federation.

Amani Saani, head of the Zanzibar youth delegation and head of the "Youth's Own Union" of Zanzibar, said that the people of Zanzibar live in disaster, and these disasters are all caused by imperialism. He said, "We feel fortunate that we have your support in our struggle to get rid of imperialist rule. We must drive imperialism out of our motherland."

Finally, with warm applause, people passed the telegram from the youth of all circles in the capital commemorating "Anti-Colonialism Day" to the youth of Asia and Africa.

Foreign guests invited to attend the meeting included: the Algerian youth delegation, the Algerian student delegation, Gbabou Dominique, National Chairman of the Youth League of the Congolese National Movement Party, the Cameroon youth delegation, the Zanzibar youth delegation, Bendeiss Brahim, representative of the General Union of Algerian Workers, Mvie Louis, Secretary-General of the Gabonese Trade Union Federation, Ali Sultan Issa, Organizational Secretary of the Zanzibar Labor Federation, the Cyprus trade union delegation, and students from Asian, African, and Latin American countries studying in Beijing.

The meeting was jointly sponsored by the All-China Youth Federation, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the All-China Students' Federation, the Beijing Youth Federation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and the Beijing Students' Federation.

    全国青联副主席杨静仁在大会上讲话。他强调指出：只要亚、非、拉丁美洲各国人民和青年加强团结，坚持斗争，提高警惕，不受帝国主义挑拨离间、不对帝国主义存有幻想，就必能取得民族独立运动的最后胜利，就一定会把万恶的帝国主义殖民主义制度彻底、干净、完全地埋葬掉。他说：在东风继续压倒西风的大好形势下，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营欣欣向荣，亚、非、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动蓬勃发展，取得了一个又一个的重大胜利。团结起来坚持斗争的亚、非、拉丁美洲人民是不可战胜的无畏的新生力量。他们的斗争起着根本上动摇帝国主义制度的伟大作用。貌似强大、外强中干的帝国主义不过是纸老虎。帝国主义任何阴谋诡计都无法挽救它必然崩溃和灭亡的命运。他在讲话中代表中国青年，向为了反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立而进行英勇斗争的亚、非、拉丁美洲各国青年，致崇高的敬礼。

    阿尔及利亚青年代表团代表菲尔齐乌依·阿卜德尔哈米德在会上说，法国殖民主义者不顾非洲各国人民的意志，在我们的土地上进行战争，很明显，这是要阻止非洲巨大的解放运动，威胁着非洲人民的安全。在这种情况下，我们不得不采取武装斗争的形式，阿尔及利亚人民应成为自己命运的主人。他说，只要殖民主义没有消除，就不可能设想有真正的和平。
    喀麦隆青年代表团团长、喀麦隆民主青年联盟宣传书记阿罗伊·马利讲话说，中国人民和青年建设祖国所获得的伟大成就，雄辩地证明了，取得民族独立国家的人民，可以创造奇迹。殖民主义制度就是意味着贫困、愚昧。我们争取完全真正独立的斗争，将一直进行到最后胜利。
