    "How dare you disobey!"	Li Shaocen
    "I am a worker,
    A worker is the master,
    The master's words are law,
    I demand you automate,
    How dare you disobey!"
    This poem is truly powerful. Reading it once fills you with vigor; reading it twice makes you want to roll up your sleeves; reading it further, you can't help but want to engage in a great endeavor.
    Man is the master of the machine; only the working class says this, and only socialist and communist societies have this.
    In capitalist society, man is the slave of the machine. In that society, automation offers no benefit to the workers; it drives the majority of workers to the streets to freeze and starve to death, while binding the remaining workers even more tightly to the rapidly advancing conveyor belt, forcing flesh and blood to conform to the speed of the machine.
    This fact of man's subservience to the machine is reflected in the human mind, forming a fetish akin to commodity fetishism. Some hate machines, some fear machines, some worship machines; in short, the machine, which was originally created by man, is manipulating man.
    In socialist society, man is no longer the slave of the machine, the machine can no longer drive man away, can no longer torment man, and certainly cannot stir up trouble by causing overproduction. The working class is able to carry the revolution through to the end precisely because it is connected to advanced productive forces and directly controls the machines. The machines should and can listen to the workers; they must serve the people according to the will of the working class.
    But all kinds of superstitions about machines cannot be completely eliminated at once. There are such people who do not believe in gods or ghosts, but are somewhat afraid of machines. This kind of superstition has also been shattered in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements. Look! How confident and awe-inspiring the workers are in front of the machines:
      "I demand you automate, how dare you disobey!"

### “你敢不答应！”

    “你敢不答应！”	黎少岑
    “我是工人，
    工人是主人，
    主人说话就算数，
    要你自动，
    你敢不答应！”
    这首诗真有劲，读它一遍，精神抖擞；读它两遍，摩拳擦掌；再读下去，就非大干一通不可了。
    人是机器的主人，这话只有工人阶级才说，这事也只有社会主义、共产主义社会才有。
    在资本主义社会里，人是机器的奴隶。在那个社会里，自动化是对工人没有什么好处的，它会把多数工人驱逐到街头去冻馁而死，同时把那剩下的一部分工人更紧紧地附着于飞速前进的输送带，迫使血肉之躯去适合那机器的速度。
    这种人隶属于机器的事实反映在人的头脑里，便和商品拜物教一样地形成迷信。有人恨机器，有人怕机器，有人崇拜机器，一句话，那本来是人造出来的机器，在播弄人了。
    在社会主义社会里，人再不是机器的奴隶，机器再不能驱逐人了，再不能折磨人了，更不用说，再不能兴风作浪闹什么生产过剩了。工人阶级之所以能把革命进行到底，就因为工人阶级是和先进的生产力相联系的，是直接掌握机器的，机器是应该也能够听工人的话的，它必须按照工人阶级的意志，为人民服务。
    但关于机器的各式各样迷信也不是一下子便能完全消除的，就有这样的人，不信神，不信鬼，可是就有点怕机器。在技术革新和技术革命运动中这一类的迷信，也已经被打破了。看！工人们在机器面前是多么理直气壮，威风凛凛：
      “要你自动，你敢不答应！”
