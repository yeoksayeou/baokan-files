Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 29th: Over four million commune members in Zhejiang Province are enthusiastically engaged in a high-efficiency, high-quality competition to rush-transplant early rice. As of April 27th, over 6.5 million mu of early rice had been transplanted across the province. In recent days, the province has been transplanting approximately one million mu of rice daily, more than double the rate of the previous few days. Currently, cadres and commune members are racing against time to rush-transplant, striving to complete all early rice transplanting before the Start of Summer.

In light of the arrival of the busy season for early rice transplanting, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call on April 24th, urging all localities to concentrate all forces, organize labor cooperation, ensure the season, ensure acreage, ensure quality, and complete the early rice transplanting task both quickly and well. Party committees at all levels, the vast numbers of cadres, and the masses across the province have enthusiastically responded to the Provincial Committee's call. Currently, leading cadres such as Party committee secretaries have gone deep into the fields to participate in transplanting and lead the transplanting efforts. Lü Zhixian, First Secretary of the Jinhua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the First Secretaries of more than ten counties in the region, have led cadres to the fields, both transplanting rice and studying and summarizing advanced experiences in high efficiency and high quality, and rapidly promoting them. Many prefectural and county Party committee leaders in Ningbo, Jiaxing, and Wenzhou prefectures have also gone deep into the fields to promptly summarize and promote the advanced experiences of local skilled workers in both machine-transplanting and manual transplanting. With leading cadres going deep into the fields to participate in and direct the rush-transplanting, the enthusiasm of commune members in various localities has been further boosted, and competitions between counties, communes, teams, and individuals are increasing. In the Hangjiahu Plain, Tongxiang and Haining counties are concentrating labor to carry out competitions in transplanting speed, standards, and acreage. Many regions and communes are also carrying out large-scale labor cooperation based on the principles of equal exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit, with mutual support between mountainous areas and plains, between urban and rural areas, and between communes and teams. The mutual cooperation of seventy-six production teams in the Chengxi Commune of Linhai County has resolved the difficulties of twenty-three teams lacking labor, draught cattle, and seedlings, accelerating the transplanting progress by one time compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 29th: Secretaries of the five-level Party organizations in Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, have universally learned and taken the lead in using rice transplanters, vigorously promoting the work of popularizing rice transplanters. Currently, over 35,000 "Zhejiang No. 1" and other rice transplanters have been manufactured in the region, of which over 90% have been delivered to production teams and are being gradually put into early rice transplanting.

In order to encourage commune members to use rice transplanters, the Ningbo Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan: "Secretaries at all levels should personally take action, and everyone should learn to use rice transplanters." Secretaries of the five-level Party organizations, including the Prefectural Committee, County Committee, Commune Party Committee, Production Brigade General Branch, and Production Team Branch, have all taken the lead in participating in training classes to learn operating techniques. At present, leading cadres such as Zhou Xiaoru, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Prefectural Committee, and Shen Hongkang, member of the Standing Committee, have mastered the operating techniques of rice transplanters; the vast majority of the twenty-two county and city Party committee first secretaries and secretaries in charge of agriculture have learned to use rice transplanters; according to statistics from 164 communes in the entire prefecture, among the 4,785 Commune Party Committee secretaries, Production Brigade General Branch secretaries, and Production Team Branch secretaries, 3,154 people can currently use rice transplanters.

Many Party organization secretaries have discovered a set of experiences in using rice transplanters in actual operation, and some have also created new tools to cooperate with rice transplanters, which have doubled efficiency and made transplanting faster and better. The Party Committee Secretary of the Daqi Commune in Ningbo City and commune members jointly created a seedling box, which reduced the machine stop time for loading seedlings from seven minutes to just over one minute, increasing efficiency by about one time. Currently, this commune has promoted more than 2,000 seedling boxes. Wang Yanxuan, the Party Committee Secretary of Dongpu Commune in Shaoxing County, also summarized a set of rice transplanter operating experiences and personally demonstrated them to commune members, helping commune members improve their operating skills.

    浙江四百万人抢插早稻
    宁波专区五级党组织书记带头使用插秧机
    新华社杭州29日电　浙江四百多万人民公社社员热烈开展高工效、高质量竞赛，突击抢插早稻。到4月27日止，全省已插下早稻六百五十多万亩。几天来，全省每天插秧达一百万亩左右，比前几天增加二倍以上。现在广大干部和社员正分秒必争，突击抢插，力争立夏以前全部插完早稻。
    根据早稻插秧大忙季节已经到来的情况，中共浙江省委在4月24日发出号召，要求各地集中一切力量，组织劳力协作，保季节、保面积、保质量，既快又好地完成早稻插秧任务。全省各级党委、广大干部和群众，热烈响应省委号召。目前各级党委书记等领导干部已纷纷深入田间，参加插秧，领导插秧。中共金华地委第一书记吕志先和全区十多个县的县委第一书记，都带领干部下田，边插秧边研究总结高工效、高质量的先进经验，迅速推广。宁波、嘉兴、温州等专区许多地委、县委领导干部也深入田间及时总结推广了当地机插和手插高工效能手的先进经验。在领导干部深入田间参加和指挥抢插的情况下，各地人民公社社员的干劲更足，县与县、社与社、队与队、人与人相互挂钩竞赛越来越多。杭嘉湖平原的桐乡、海宁两县集中劳力开展插秧比速度、比规格、比面积竞赛。许多地区、公社还根据等价交换互助互利的原则，开展劳力大协作，山区与平原之间、城乡之间、社与社、队与队之间，相互支援。临海县城西公社七十六个生产队相互协作的结果，解决了二十三个队缺劳力、耕牛和秧苗的困难，使插秧进度比去年同期加快一倍。
    新华社杭州29日电　浙江宁波专区五级党组织的书记普遍学会和带头使用插秧机，有力地推动了插秧机的推广工作。现在全区已经制出“浙江一号”等插秧机三万五千多部，其中有90％以上已经送到了生产队，正在陆续投入早稻插秧。
    为了带动社员使用插秧机，中共宁波地委提出了“各级书记亲自动手，人人学会使用插秧机”的口号。地委、县委、公社党委和生产大队总支、生产队支部等五级党组织的书记，都带头参加训练班学习操作技术。目前，地委书记处书记周效儒、常委沈宏康等领导干部已经掌握了插秧机的操作技术；二十二个县、市委第一书记和管农业的书记绝大多数已学会了使用插秧机；据全专区一百六十四个公社统计，公社党委书记、生产大队总支书记和生产队支部书记四千七百八十五人中，目前已有三千一百五十四人会使用插秧机。
    许多党组织书记在实际操作中，已摸出了一套使用插秧机的经验，有的还创造了配合插秧机的新工具，使工效成倍提高，插秧又快又好。宁波市大碶公社党委书记和社员们一道创造了装秧箱，使停机装秧时间由每次七分钟缩短到一分多钟，工效提高一倍左右，目前这个公社已推广装秧箱二千多只；绍兴县东浦公社党委书记王衍轩还总结出一套插秧机操作经验，并亲自表演给社员看，帮助社员提高了操作技术水平。
