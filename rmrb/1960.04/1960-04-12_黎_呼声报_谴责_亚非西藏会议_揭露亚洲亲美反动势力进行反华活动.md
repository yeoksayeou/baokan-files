Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, April 10th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Nida" published articles on both the 9th and 10th, denouncing the so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" being held in New Delhi. The newspaper emphasized that this so-called conference "is part of the imperialists' various activities in Asia against the People's China."

The newspaper pointed out that although everything that has happened in Tibet has been carried out in accordance with the wishes and interests of the Tibetan people, and although the region has been restored to stability with the help of the government, "American imperialism is still unwilling to let the Tibetan people live according to their own desires and wishes. To this end, it has mobilized people like Naccache (former Lebanese president) and Bechara el-Khoury (Lebanese pro-American elements) to slander China and to smear the thriving 650 million Chinese people."

"Al-Nida" pointed out that "el-Khoury is the notorious head of the Middle East branch of the American organization 'Congress for Cultural Freedom,' a product of McCarthyism."

"Al-Nida" revealed that the imperialist bloc had tried every means to mobilize prominent Lebanese figures to attend this conference, but they only managed to gather Naccache and el-Khoury. The newspaper pointed out that the trip to New Delhi by Naccache and others attending this "conference" "is nothing more than obeying the dictates of imperialism and following the will of imperialism." The newspaper emphasized that "the Tibetan people are carrying out an anti-feudal revolution... they have achieved victory, and with the help of the government, they have begun to build their new life, while striving to develop their economy and striving to improve their cultural and social standards and carry out construction work."

    黎“呼声报”谴责“亚非西藏会议”
    揭露亚洲亲美反动势力进行反华活动
    新华社贝鲁特10日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”9、10两日接连刊载文章，谴责正在新德里举行的所谓“亚非西藏会议”。报纸强调指出，这个所谓的会议，“是帝国主义在亚洲反对人民中国的各种活动的一部分”。
    报纸指出，尽管在西藏发生的一切事情都是依据西藏人民的意愿和利益进行的，尽管在政府帮助下这个地区已经恢复了稳定，但是“美帝国主义仍然不愿意让西藏人民按照自己的心愿和意愿来生活。为此它动员诸如纳卡希（前黎巴嫩总统）和贝沙拉·戈拉耶卜（黎巴嫩亲美分子）之流来诽谤中国，来污蔑欣欣向荣的六亿五千万中国人民”。
    “呼声报”指出，“戈拉耶卜是臭名远扬的美国组织‘文化自由协会’的中东支部的负责人，而这个美国组织是麦卡锡主义的产物”。
    “呼声报”揭露，帝国主义集团曾经想尽办法动员黎巴嫩著名人士去参加这次会议，但是它们只搜罗到了纳卡希和戈拉耶卜两人。报纸指出，纳卡希以及其他参加这次“会议”的人的新德里之行，“无非是听从帝国主义的发号施令和遵循帝国主义的意志办事。”报纸强调指出，“西藏人民正在进行反封建的革命……他们获得了胜利，并且在政府的帮助下已经开始建立自己的新生活，同时正在为发展自己的经济而努力，并且努力争取提高自己的文化和社会水平以及进行建设工作。”
