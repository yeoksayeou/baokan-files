Editorial: Promoting the "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets" Movement in Developing Animal Husbandry

    High-speed development of animal husbandry is a prerequisite for the high-speed development of agricultural production. Taking the path of equal emphasis on animal husbandry and crop cultivation has become a very important issue in our country's rural economic construction.

    Since last winter, a vigorous pig-raising upsurge has swept across the country. Driven by the pig-raising upsurge, many places have launched mass movements for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. The "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets" movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which focuses on increasing the breeding and survival rates of livestock, and the "Ten Thousand Sheep, Ten Thousand Lambs" and "Ten Thousand Horses, Ten Thousand Foals" movements in Qinghai and other places, are new developments in mass movements in animal husbandry production. The slogan "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets" was put forward by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee after summarizing the experience of the autonomous region's high-yielding livestock herds in developing animal husbandry at high speed. In 1959 under the glorious illumination of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and People's Communes, a new situation of continuous leap forward emerged in Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry, and a large number of advanced units developing animal husbandry at high speed emerged, creating a wealth of experience in developing animal husbandry at high speed. This excellent new situation of the leap forward reflected the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen and their urgent demand to accelerate the development of animal husbandry production, and also reflected the objective possibility of developing animal husbandry production at high speed. Therefore, the slogan "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets," which correctly reflected this movement, immediately generated tremendous material strength and pushed the movement to a new high tide. According to the materials of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets" movement, which started in the summer of last year, has achieved remarkable results in just a few months, greatly promoting the development of animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Now, three communes and ninety-three management areas, including four thousand eight hundred and twelve livestock herds in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have achieved "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets." As of the end of March, the number of lambs delivered in the entire region this year has increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year.

    The content of the "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets" movement is to require one hundred eligible female animals to breed and raise one hundred or more live offspring within one year, and also to correspondingly increase the proportion of various improved livestock. In order to achieve this requirement, it is necessary to greatly increase the number of livestock on the one hand, and also to rapidly improve the quality of livestock on the other hand; it is necessary to develop small livestock at high speed, and also to develop large livestock at high speed. The speed of animal husbandry development is reflected in the level of livestock breeding rate and offspring survival rate. The "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets," "Ten Thousand Sheep, Ten Thousand Lambs," and "Ten Thousand Horses, Ten Thousand Foals" movements are movements to raise the livestock breeding and survival rates to a higher level, and are good forms for further implementing the General Line on the animal husbandry front. To achieve the advanced goals of "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets," "Ten Thousand Sheep, Ten Thousand Lambs," and "Ten Thousand Horses, Ten Thousand Foals," it is necessary to ensure that every eligible female animal is pregnant and produces offspring, and that all offspring are fully alive and strong. This requires comprehensively improving the management level of animal husbandry production, and doing a good job in a series of production-increasing measures in animal husbandry such as livestock breeding, pregnancy maintenance, lambing, rearing, grazing, epidemic prevention, shed construction, forage feed, feeding management, and tool reform. Every task must be done well, every task must be innovated, and no link can be relaxed. In this sense, carrying out mass movements such as "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets," "Ten Thousand Sheep, Ten Thousand Lambs," and "Ten Thousand Horses, Ten Thousand Foals" can become a general program for developing animal husbandry production at high speed; as long as we firmly grasp this program, we can drive the entire animal husbandry production and push it to a new stage.

    The victory of all undertakings depends on the masses, and the implementation of all work must follow the mass line. This is the basic political line and organizational line of our party. The people are the creators of history and the most active factor in the productive forces. The full play of the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people can enable our production and construction to develop at high speed. This is also the case in animal husbandry production. Animal husbandry production, like agricultural production, is highly seasonal and greatly affected by nature. At the same time, the reproduction of livestock not only requires appropriate natural conditions, but also requires people's careful feeding and management. In recent years, compared with the high-speed development of agricultural production, animal husbandry production has been a relatively weak link. Animal husbandry must be developed to a greater extent in order to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the entire national economy, especially the agricultural economy. The high-speed development of animal husbandry is an important economic measure on the entire agricultural front, and also an important political task. The "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets" movement in Inner Mongolia and the great achievements it has already achieved prove that the high-speed development of animal husbandry is entirely possible. The experience of Inner Mongolia tells us that in order to make animal husbandry develop more rapidly, we must fully mobilize the masses, break the superstition that livestock cannot develop at high speed, emancipate our minds, and establish the lofty aspirations of "One Hundred Sows, One Hundred Piglets," "Ten Thousand Sheep, Ten Thousand Lambs," and "Ten Thousand Horses, Ten Thousand Foals." Of course, to achieve this goal, it is necessary to overcome many difficulties and do a lot of work. The comrades in Inner Mongolia have overcome many difficulties and achieved good results in many tasks because they have conscientiously implemented the Party's mass line in their work and carried out continuous mass movements throughout the year in accordance with the laws of animal husbandry production and the characteristics of each season. For example, from December last year to February this year, they launched a movement focusing on disaster prevention, lambing, and water conservancy construction. From March to May, they are launching a movement focusing on spring lambing, large animal breeding, spring disaster prevention, and feed sowing. This has enabled animal husbandry production to develop wave upon wave and link upon link.

    Now, the Party committees in various parts of the country have greatly strengthened their leadership over animal husbandry, and have established a relatively strong animal husbandry team; the inter-dependent relationship between animal husbandry and agriculture has been deeply understood by more and more cadres and the masses, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses for developing animal husbandry has been unprecedentedly promoted, and a good situation for the high-speed development of animal husbandry has been formed. We believe that if all localities can strengthen their leadership over animal husbandry, conscientiously sum up and promote various effective advanced experiences in their localities, and vigorously carry out mass movements like the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a comprehensive leap forward in animal husbandry will surely be realized throughout the country.

### 在发展畜牧业中推广“百母百仔”运动

    在发展畜牧业中推广“百母百仔”运动
    高速度发展畜牧业，是高速度发展农业生产的必要条件。走畜牧业与种植业并重的道路，已经成为我国发展农村经济建设中一个十分重要的课题。
    去年冬季以来，全国掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的养猪高潮。在养猪高潮的推动下，不少地方开展了高速度发展畜牧业生产的群众运动。内蒙古自治区开展的以提高牲畜繁殖成活率为中心的“百母百仔”运动，以及在青海等地开展的“万羊万羔”“万马万驹”运动，就是畜牧业生产中群众运动的新发展。“百母百仔”这个口号是内蒙古自治区党委总结了自治区丰产牧群高速度发展畜牧业的经验的基础上提出来的。1959年，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，内蒙古的畜牧业出现了连续跃进的新形势，并且出现了大量的高速度发展畜牧业的先进单位，创造了丰富的高速度发展畜牧业的经验。这个新的跃进的大好形势，反映了广大农牧民的冲天干劲和加速发展畜牧生产的迫切要求，也反映了高速度发展畜牧业生产的客观可能性。因此，正确反映了这个运动的“百母百仔”的口号一经提出，立即产生了巨大的物质力量，把运动推进到了一个新的高潮。根据内蒙古自治区的材料，“百母百仔”运动从去年夏天开始到现在，不过短短几个月的时间，已经收到了显著的效果，大大促进了内蒙古自治区的畜牧业的发展。现在，内蒙古自治区已经有三个公社、九十三个管理区共包括四千八百一十二个畜群实现了“百母百仔”。截至3月底为止，今年全区的接羔头数，与去年同期相比，也增加了30％以上。
    “百母百仔”运动的内容，是要求一百头适龄母畜，在一年内繁殖成活一百头和一百头以上的仔畜，同时也相应地提高各种改良牲畜的比例。为了实现这个要求，就要一方面大大增加牲畜的数量，同时也要迅速改良牲畜的质量；既要高速度地发展小牲畜，也要高速度地发展大牲畜。畜牧业发展速度的高低，表现在牲畜繁殖率和仔畜成活率的高低上。“百母百仔”、“万羊万羔”、“万马万驹”运动，就是把牲畜繁殖成活率提高到一个更高水平的运动，是在畜牧业战线上进一步贯彻总路线的好形式。要实现“百母百仔”、“万羊万羔”、“万马万驹”等先进的目标，必须使每一头适龄母畜都要怀胎、生产，使所有的仔畜都要全活、全壮。这就必须全面提高畜牧业生产的经营管理水平，必须做好牲畜的配种、保胎、接羔、保育、放牧、疫物防治、棚圈建设、饲草饲料、饲养管理、工具改革等一系列畜牧生产的增产措施。每一项工作都要作好，每项工作上都要有所革新，不论那一个环节都不能放松。在这个意义上，开展“百母百仔”、“万羊万羔”、“万马万驹”等群众运动，可以成为高速度发展畜牧生产的一条总纲；只要我们紧紧抓住这条纲，就可以把整个畜牧生产都带动起来，把它推向一个新的阶段。
    一切事业的胜利都要依靠群众，一切工作的进行都要走群众路线，这是我们党的基本的政治路线和组织路线。人民群众是历史的创造者，是生产力中最活跃的因素。广大人民群众充分发挥积极性和创造性，就能使我们的生产建设得到高速度的发展。在畜牧业生产中，也是如此。畜牧业生产和农业生产一样，季节性很强，受自然的影响很大。同时，牲畜的增殖不仅要有适当的自然条件，更需要人们对它的周到的饲养管理。几年来，和高速度发展的农业生产比较起来，畜牧业生产是一个比较薄弱的环节。必须使畜牧业有一个更大的发展，才能适应整个国民经济首先是农业经济高速度发展的需要。高速度发展畜牧业是整个农业战线上一项重要的经济措施，也是一项重要的政治任务。内蒙古的“百母百仔”运动和这个运动已经获得的伟大成绩证明：高速度发展畜牧业是完全可能的，内蒙古的经验告诉我们，要使畜牧业更迅速地向前发展，必须把群众充分发动起来，破除牲畜不能高速度发展的迷信，解放思想，树立“百母百仔”、“万羊万羔”、“万马万驹”的雄心壮志。当然，要达到这个目标，是要克服不少困难做好许多工作才能实现的。内蒙古的同志们由于认真地在工作贯彻中执行了党的群众路线并且按照畜牧生产的规律和各个季节的特点，开展了常年的持续不断的群众运动，许多困难都被他们克服了，许多工作都获得了很好的成绩。例如从去年12月到今年2月他们开展了的以防灾、接羔、兴修水利为中心的运动，3月至5月又正开展以接春羔、大畜配种、防春灾、饲料播种为中心的运动等，这样就使畜牧生产一浪高一浪、一环扣一环地向前发展了起来。
    现在，全国各地党委对于畜牧业的领导已经大大加强，并且建立起了一支比较强大的畜牧业队伍；畜牧业与农业的相互依存的关系已经为越来越多的干部和群众所深切了解，广大群众发展畜牧业的积极性已经空前地发扬起来，一个高速度发展畜牧业的大好形势已经形成。我们相信，如果各地都能像内蒙古自治区那样，加强对畜牧业的领导，认真总结和推广当地各种行之有效的先进经验，大搞群众运动，畜牧业的全面大跃进，一定能够在全国实现。
