    Flowers of Youth and Friendship
    ——Welcome the Central Art Troupe of the Hungarian Communist Youth League
    Zeng Delin

    As we warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the Hungarian people, the visit and performance of the Central Art Troupe of the Hungarian Communist Youth League in our country is truly the icing on the cake, making us feel extremely happy.

    The Hungarian Communist Youth League, inheriting the tradition of the Hungarian communist youth movement, was born in the storms of revolutionary struggle. From the very first day of its establishment, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, it has united the youth in a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionaries and modern revisionism, mobilizing the youth to actively participate in the restoration of the national economy and the acceleration of socialist construction. Hundreds of thousands of young people enthusiastically responded to the youth league's proposed austerity campaign, the socialist labor team competition, and social voluntary labor. The vast number of rural youth responded to the Party's call to actively participate in the movement to realize agricultural collectivization. All of this demonstrates that the Hungarian Communist Youth League, as the Party's loyal assistant, has made outstanding contributions in carrying out communist education for youth and in the struggle to build socialism and communism. We Chinese youth express our great admiration for this.

    The visit and performance of the Central Art Troupe of the Hungarian Communist Youth League to our country not only brings us exquisite art with Hungarian national characteristics but also brings us the friendship of Hungarian youth towards Chinese youth. The troupe's premiere in Beijing on April 2nd left us with a deep and unforgettable impression. Their performances have both distinct national styles and rich and substantial content. Chinese youth are familiar with and delighted by Hungarian art. From the performances, we saw the heroic struggle of the Hungarian people and youth, felt the joyful atmosphere of their lives today, and foresaw their even brighter tomorrow. We know that in socialist countries, culture and art are powerful weapons for carrying out communist education for the people and youth and for opposing modern revisionism. In recent years, under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic thought and under the leadership of the Party, the Central Art Troupe of the Hungarian Communist Youth League has become a strong and powerful force on the Hungarian literary and artistic front. We firmly believe that the Central Art Troupe of the Hungarian Communist Youth League will play a greater role and make greater contributions in fulfilling its glorious mission in the future.

    Let us wish them success in their visits and performances throughout our country, and wish that the unbreakable friendship between the people and youth of China and Hungary will be as long-lasting as the Yangtze River and the Danube.

    青春和友谊的花朵
    ——欢迎匈牙利共青团中央艺术团
    曾德林
    在我们热烈庆祝匈牙利人民解放十五周年的时候，匈牙利共青团中央艺术团来到我国访问演出，这真是锦上添花，使我们感到无比的高兴。
    匈牙利共青团继承着匈牙利共产主义青年运动的传统，在革命斗争的暴风雨中诞生。从它成立的第一天起就在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，团结青年对反革命分子和现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争，动员青年积极参加了恢复国民经济和加速社会主义建设的工作。数十万青年热烈响应共青团所倡议的节约运动、争取社会主义劳动队的竞赛和社会义务劳动。广大的农村青年响应党的号召积极参加实现农业合作化的运动。所有这一切说明了匈牙利共青团作为党的忠实助手，在对青年进行共产主义教育、在建设社会主义和共产主义的斗争中，都作出了出色的贡献。对此，我们中国青年表示十分的钦佩。
    匈牙利共青团中央艺术团来我国访问演出，不仅给我们带来了具有匈牙利民族风格的精湛的艺术，而且也给我们带来了匈牙利青年对中国青年的友谊。艺术团4月2日在北京的首次公演，给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。他们的演出既有鲜明的民族风格，又有丰富充实的内容。中国青年对匈牙利的艺术是熟悉和喜悦的。从演出中，使我们看到了匈牙利人民和青年英勇斗争的形象，感受到他们今天生活的欢乐气氛，预见到他们更加美好的明天。我们知道，在社会主义国家里，文化艺术是对人民和青年进行共产主义教育、反对现代修正主义的有力武器。几年来，匈牙利共青团中央艺术团在马克思列宁主义的文艺思想的指引下，在党的领导下，已经成为匈牙利文艺战线上一支坚强有力的队伍。我们深信，匈牙利共青团中央艺术团今后在完成光荣的任务中，必将发挥更大的作用，作出更大的贡献。
    让我们预祝他们在我国各地的访问演出成功，祝中匈两国人民和青年之间的牢不可破的友谊像长江和多瑙河一样源远流长。
