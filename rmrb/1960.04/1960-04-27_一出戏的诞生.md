The Birth of a Play
Jiang Hongqi, Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan First Commercial Bureau Committee of the CPC

At the beginning of this year, the staff of our First Commercial Bureau system wrote and performed a large-scale drama "Relatives," reflecting how commercial employees serve production and the people. This play was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the audience. In particular, the commercial employees responded strongly, and everyone was moved by the heroic image of the advanced figure Zheng Yulan, considering it to be a profound communist education. Many comrades were inspired by the play and demanded of themselves with the advanced thinking of the heroic figures in the play. Everyone consciously launched a mass upsurge of learning from Zheng Yulan, treating customers as relatives, and better serving customers.

None of us had ever written a script before, and we didn't understand the theatrical creations of "suspense," "conflict," or "climax." However, everyone eagerly hoped to use literary and artistic forms to sing the praises of our own heroic models. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our commercial work, like other work, has also achieved rapid development, one encouraging and exciting event after another has come one after another, and thousands upon thousands of advanced workers have grown up and emerged. After the comrades raised this idea, it immediately received the support and encouragement of the Party committee, so the comrades discussed it and started working on it.

At the beginning of writing, we encountered many difficulties, and no matter how we wrote, it didn't look like a play. We said a lot of things, but we didn't explain it clearly. However, everyone was not discouraged. Because we have two basic conditions for writing a play: First, we are very familiar with the life we want to write about, the material is everywhere, and we love it very much, and our feelings are very deep, and the content to be written is very rich. Secondly, because we have all lived in the commercial sector for a long time and personally participated in various political struggles in the commercial sector, we are also very familiar with the struggle between the two roads and the two ideologies in the commercial sector, and we have a clear love and hate. In addition, we can closely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, and learn modestly. In order to write the play well, the comrades often asked the Party for instructions, consulted with everyone, discussed it again and again, and studied it little by little, one suggestion from you, one idea from me, and everyone put it together. At the same time, everyone seriously studied Chairman Mao's theory of literature and art, and we squeezed time to watch all the plays and movies related to the Great Leap Forward. If we didn't have enough after watching it, we would find the script to read, read it and then watch it again, repeatedly learning from the good points of others. If we heard of any report meetings on literary and artistic theory and creative experience, we would try our best to run to listen to it, and after listening to it, we would come back and discuss, study, and revise it in combination with our own creation. In this way, we enriched ourselves and improved ourselves in all aspects, plus the Party's timely teaching and cordial care, and after repeated revisions, the script finally began to take shape, the characters came alive, and things went smoothly.

After the first draft was written, in order to solicit more opinions, it was given to professional literary and art groups for experts to review. The experts took a look and encouraged, "It's well written, it has a strong atmosphere of life, it's very ideological, and it has a certain artistic expression ability, if you add some more processing, it can become a good thing!" Everyone was even more confident and motivated when they heard this. At this time, the Party also always told everyone to humbly accept other people's opinions. The comrades humbly and sincerely accepted the opinions of professional literary and art groups and their enthusiastic and patient guidance. Wherever they raised points that needed to be deleted, as long as they were correct, they would be deleted boldly and without reservation, and without feeling any pain. Wherever they thought it needed to be enriched, they would seriously study and process it again. After many more revisions, the play was much better than before. At this time, the Party committee decided that, in order to timely cooperate with the development of the comparison, learning, catching up, and helping movement, and to carry out publicity and education to employees in combination with the central work, and also to allow the masses to more widely appraise the good and bad of this play, it immediately transferred actors to rehearse and perform. In the process of the performance, it was repeatedly revised according to the opinions of the masses. The responsible comrades of the Bureau Party Committee also often discussed and studied with everyone. Often, they would work until one or two o'clock in the morning, which further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm. In this way, after countless revisions and supplements, the script was greatly improved in terms of ideology and artistry.

Let's talk about acting! At the beginning, who had ever acted in a drama? Even speaking Mandarin was difficult, let alone the stage setting, lighting, makeup... we didn't know anything about it, but everyone was not intimidated, because the actors were all salespersons, processors, accountants, and store branch secretaries, acting in their own affairs and promoting their own work, and this was the long-cherished wish of everyone to put themselves on the stage, so everyone seemed to have a force supporting them, their political enthusiasm was very high, their enthusiasm was very great, and they all took acting well as a political task to complete. If they were not familiar with some aspects of life, they would go deep into the life to experience it. If they could not speak Mandarin well, they would ask teachers everywhere. If they were not sure how to pronounce a word, they would write it on their hands, remember it in their hearts, learn from everyone they met, and ask everyone they saw. In the cold winter nights, the comrades rehearsed the play while still sweating profusely. Many comrades were still saying their lines in their dreams, repeating the director's reminders. Some stage work such as set design and lighting, on the one hand, apprenticed to professional literary and art groups, and on the other hand, used their own brains to find ways. In order to master these techniques, and without affecting the rehearsal, everyone still experimented and learned over and over again when the actors were resting. Because they had a clear ideological purpose, plus hard study and practice, and concerted efforts, the technology was quickly mastered. When some comrades from professional literary and art groups saw that a relatively complicated set could be changed in just over a minute during the performance, they were all a little surprised and praised.

In the process of rehearsing the play, in order to enable the comrades to meet the requirements of the roles and the plot as soon as possible, the Party committee always attached importance to political and ideological work, established Party and League branches, and timely put forward central slogans according to the specific situations that appeared in various stages of the rehearsal. For example, at the beginning, we put forward the battle to "pass five levels" (language, action, emotion, atmosphere, and stage work), and when the protagonist Zheng Yulan could not meet the requirements in shaping her character, we put forward the battle slogan of "everything for Zheng Yulan", calling on everyone to contribute to the shaping of Zheng Yulan. Several secretaries of the Bureau Party Committee often personally guided the rehearsal on the spot, shared the joys and sorrows of creation with the comrades, and jointly studied the key problems in creation, and pointed out the way out in a timely and correct manner. The broad masses of commercial employees also provided strong backing for the performance of the play. When the employees heard that it was a play about themselves, they gave their greatest support. When making the set, the employees sent us a large number of packaging cloths and the best carpenters and props needed for the play. The employees had everything they needed and as much as they needed. The employees also used all their time to make all the costumes for the actors in just two days. Some experts from professional literary and art groups also came to guide in person and helped us rehearse earnestly and patiently.

In this way, under the close care of the Party, under the arduous study of the cast and crew and the strong support of the broad masses of employees, and with the enthusiastic assistance of professional literary and art groups, the play was finally rehearsed and met the broad masses of the audience.

The wisdom of the masses is endless, and the creative talents of the masses are the greatest and richest!

    一出戏的诞生
    中共武汉市第一商业局委员会副书记　江洪其
    今年年初，我们第一商业局系统的职工自己编写、自己演出了一个反映商业职工如何为生产、为人民服务的大型话剧“亲人”，这戏受到广大观众的热烈欢迎。尤其是商业职工，反应更加强烈，大家都被剧中先进人物郑玉岚的英雄形象所感动，认为是受了一次深刻的共产主义教育。许多同志从剧中得到了启发，纷纷以剧中英雄人物的先进思想来要求自己。大家自觉地开展了一个向郑玉岚学习、把顾客当亲人，更好地为顾客服务的群众性热潮。
    写剧本，我们过去谁也没写过，根本不懂得戏剧创作上的一些“悬念”啦、“冲突”啦、“高潮”啦的玩艺儿。可是，大家都迫切地希望用文艺的形式来歌颂一下我们自己的英雄模范。从1958年大跃进以来，我们的商业工作也跟其他工作一样，得到了飞跃的发展，一个一个令人鼓舞和激动人心的事件接连而来，成千上万的先进工作者成长起来了，涌现出来了。同志们这个想法提出来以后，立即得到了党委的支持和鼓励，于是，同志们便商量了一下干起来了。
    开始写的时候，遇到的困难可真不少，写来写去总不像个戏，事情说了一大些，却没说清个红绿来。可是大家并不气馁。因为我们具备着两个写戏的基本条件：首先是咱们对于所要写的生活非常熟悉，素材到处都是，而且我们对它非常热爱，自己的感受也很深刻，要写的内容很丰富。其次，由于我们都长期生活在商业部门，亲自参加了商业部门各种政治斗争，所以对商业部门中两条道路、两种思想斗争也非常熟悉，爱憎分明。再加上我们能紧密依靠党的领导，依靠群众，虚心学习，为了把戏写好，同志们经常向党请示，找大家商量，一遍一遍地讨论，一点一点地研究，你一个建议，我一个主意，大家往一块凑。同时，大家认真学习了毛主席的文艺理论，凡是有关反映大跃进题材的戏和电影，我们就挤时间去看。看了不足，就找剧本来读，读了再去看，反复地学习人家好的地方。听到哪儿有文艺理论和创作经验的报告会，就千方百计地跑去听，听了就回来结合自己的创作讨论、研究、修改。就这样，从各方面来充实自己，提高自己，更加上党的及时教导和亲切的关怀，经过反复地修改，剧本居然也就初具眉目了，人物也活了，事情也顺了。
    第一次定稿写成以后，为了征求更多方面的意见，就拿给专业文艺团体去让专家们给评一评。专家们一看，又鼓励说：“写的不错，生活气息浓厚，思想性很强，也有一定的艺术表现能力，再加加工，就能成为一个好东西！”大家一听，信心就更高了，劲头也更大了。在这时党又时刻嘱咐大家要虚心接受别人的意见。同志们虚心诚恳地接受了专业文艺团体的意见和热情耐心的辅导，凡是提出来需要删节的地方，只要是对的，就毫无保留，毫不心疼地大刀阔斧删节，凡是认为需要加以丰富的地方，便又认真地研究加工。又经过了很多次修改，戏就比原来好多了。这时，党委决定，为了及时配合比学赶帮运动的开展，结合中心工作向职工进行宣传教育，并且也为了更广泛地让群众鉴定这个戏的好坏，立即抽调了演员排练，演出。在演出过程中，又根据群众的意见，反复地改，局党委的负责同志也常常和大家一起讨论和研究、往往是一搞，就搞到深夜一两点钟，这更鼓舞了大家的干劲，就这样经过了不知多少次的修改补充，剧本在思想性和艺术性上得到了很大的提高。
    再说演戏吧！开始的时候，谁演过话剧呀？连普通话说起来都咬嘴，至于什么布景、灯光、化妆…那就更是一窍不通了，可是大家并没有被吓住，因为演员都是一些营业员、加工员、会计员和商店支部书记等，演的是自己的事，宣传自己的工作，而这又是大家长久以来想把自己搬上舞台的热切愿望，所以每个人都像有一股力量在顶着，政治热情非常高，干劲非常大，都把演好戏，当成一项政治任务来完成。有些生活不熟悉，就深入体验生活，普通话说不好，就到处求老师，哪个字咬不准，就把它写在手上，记在心里，逢人就学，见人就问。在寒冷的冬夜里，同志们一面排着戏，一面还是满头大汗。很多同志在睡梦中还在说着台词，复诵着导演的提示。一些布景、灯光等舞台工作，则一方面向专业文艺团体拜师学徒，一方面自己动脑筋，想办法。为了掌握这些技术，又不影响排戏，大家在演员休息的时候，仍然一遍一遍地试验、学习。由于有了一个明确的思想目的，加上勤学苦练，齐心合力，技术也就很快地被掌握了。当一些专业文艺团体的同志们看到在演出过程中，只用了一分多钟就换了一台比较复杂的布景的时候，都感到有些惊讶和赞叹。
    在排戏的过程中，为了使同志们早日达到角色和剧情的要求，党委一直重视了政治思想工作，成立了党团支部，根据排演的各个阶段所出现的具体情况，及时提出中心口号。例如在一开始的时候，我们就提出了“过五关”（语言、动作、情感、气氛和舞台工作）的攻关战斗，而当剧中主人翁郑玉岚在塑造上不能达到要求的时候，则又提出了“一切为了郑玉岚”的战斗口号，号召大家人人为郑玉岚的塑造贡献力量。局党委的几个书记经常亲自在现场指导排练和同志们一起分享创作的甘苦，一起研究创作上的关键问题，及时正确地指出了出路。广大的商业职工也为话剧的演出作了强大的后盾。职工们听说是演自己的戏，都给予了最大的支持。做布景时，职工为我们送来了大批的包装布，送来了最好的木匠和演戏所需要的道具。职工们是要什么有什么，要多少有多少。演员们的服装，职工们也利用一切时间只用了两天就全部做成。一些专业文艺团体的专家也亲自来辅导，认真耐心地帮助我们排练。
    就这样，在党的密切关怀下，在演职员的艰苦钻研和广大职工的大力支持下，在专业文艺团体的热情协助下，戏终于排出来了，和广大观众见面了。
    群众的智慧是无穷无尽的，群众的创造才能是最巨大和最丰富的！
