    Push the Struggle Against the U.S.-Japan Military Treaty to a New Climax
    Japanese People Decide to Launch a Stronger National Unified Action
    Five Million Petitions Have Been Submitted to the Diet; Socialist Party Decides to Collect Signatures of Another 20 Million People
    Japanese Communist Party's "Akahata" Newspaper Demands That the Japanese Working Class Stand at the Forefront of the Struggle and Calls for a General Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan decided today to hold a stronger 16th National Unified Action from May 9th to the end of May to oppose the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The action program adopted by the National Conference today emphasized that workers' strikes are the main form of struggle in the upcoming unified action. The National Conference will cooperate with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Federation of Independent Unions to request the leading bodies of various industry trade unions to issue strike instructions.
    The action program also emphasized the importance of continuing to petition the Diet. The action program stipulates that during the 16th Unified Action, petitioners will be asked not only to demand that the Diet reject the treaty, but also to demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet.
    The program requires trade unions and mass organizations that have actively participated in the movement against the new "Security Treaty" to make every effort to involve as many ordinary citizens as possible in the planned petition movement.
    The National Conference anticipates that the decisive situation regarding the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" will occur around May 10th to 15th (when the ruling party is expected to attempt again to forcibly end the Diet's debate on the new "Security Treaty") and around May 20th (when Liberal Democrats may propose a motion to extend the current Diet session).
    The National Conference also discussed the achievements of the 15th National Unified Action today. The meeting believed that the 15th Unified Action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" had dealt a heavy blow to the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, because the unified action was more powerful and larger in scale than expected.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th: According to statistics from the Japanese Diet, the Japanese people have submitted more than five million petitions to the Diet, resolutely opposing the Diet's ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    Because many petitions are jointly signed by many people, the number of signatories far exceeds the number of petitions.
    In addition, Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, said today that the Socialist Party will collect 20 million signatures against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The Japanese people's struggle against the ratification of this aggressive military alliance treaty is surging forward on the basis of the victorious 15th Unified Action. The Japanese Diet, which is discussing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," receives a large number of petitions against the ratification of this treaty every day.
    Today, Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, and others submitted 60,000 petitions collected on the 26th regarding the opposition to the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
    In addition, Fumihiko Tachikawa, a professor at Kyoto University, and two others met with Speaker Kiyose today and submitted a petition signed by 237 professors and associate professors opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." Representatives of the "Elementary Particle Physics Forum," composed of researchers from the Faculty of Science of the University of Tokyo, Tohoku University, Tokyo University of Education, and other universities across the country, also submitted a petition opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" to the Diet Secretariat today.
    Approximately 170 representatives of professors, assistant professors, and researchers from about 20 universities and research institutes submitted 500 petitions to the Diet, opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." Those who wrote the petitions included Atsutaro Yamanaka, President of Hitotsubashi University, the famous political science scholar Inejiro Numata, and all 104 researchers of the Social Policy Department of the Science Council of Japan.
    These petitioners also held a meeting in a building next to the Diet. The meeting passed a letter to Nobusuke Kishi entitled "We Warn You Again," demanding that Nobusuke Kishi dissolve the Diet and hold a general election so that the issue of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" could be referred to the people for judgment.
    Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, said at the meeting that the Socialist Party would send all of its Diet members to their respective constituencies from tomorrow until May 2nd in order to strengthen the propaganda movement against the new "Security Treaty" that is now unfolding in various places.
    As the movement continues to deepen, many business owners in Japan have also joined the struggle. The Japan-China Trade Promotion Association issued a statement in Tokyo today, announcing that 30 representatives of trading companies oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and calling on other trading and manufacturing companies to participate in the petition movement against the treaty.
    The organization also decided at a meeting held today that all of its members and their families would participate in the petition movement against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations, which is scheduled to be held on May 2nd. The meeting also requested all of its member companies and groups to hold a large-scale motorcade parade in the near future to the Diet to oppose the ratification of this treaty.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today pointing out that these few weeks will be a decisive moment in the Japanese people's struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." The editorial called on all democratic forces in the country to use all forms of struggle to fight more vigorously against the new "Security Treaty."
    The editorial pointed out that the 15th National Unified Action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," which was launched in Japan on April 26th, is of extremely great significance.
    The editorial also pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy to pass the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives has been temporarily thwarted. However, they are still attempting to deceive the people and use their followers to force the Diet to ratify the treaty.
    The editorial demanded that the Japanese working class stand at the forefront of the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" at this critical moment, and called for a general strike in all workplaces. The editorial said, "This is the key to further developing the struggle of April 26th and turning this struggle into a more lasting force."
    The editorial also said that it is no accident that the great struggle of the South Korean people gave a fatal blow to the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. "All reactionaries who try to lead the country in violation of the general trend of world peace will certainly receive the same fate." (Attached picture)

专栏：

    把反对日美军事条约的斗争推向新的高潮
    日本人民决定展开更强大的全国统一行动
    目前已有五百万份请愿书递交国会社会党决定再征集两千万人的签名
    日共“赤旗报”要求日本工人阶级站在斗争最前列并号召举行总罢工
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天决定在5月9日到5月底之间举行更加强大的第十六次全国统一行动，反对批准新日美“安全条约”。
    国民会议今天通过的行动纲领强调，工人罢工是即将进一步展开的统一行动的主要斗争方式。国民会议将同日本工会总评议会和独立工会联合会合作，要求各行业工会的领导机构发出罢工指示。
    行动纲领还强调继续向国会进行请愿的重要性。行动纲领规定，在第十六次统一行动期间，将要求请愿者不但要求国会拒绝这个条约，而且还要求立即解散国会。
    纲领要求已经积极参加反对新“安全条约”运动的工会和群众团体尽一切努力使尽可能多的普通公民参加预定举行的请愿运动。
    国民会议预料，关于批准新“安全条约”问题的决定性的形势将发生于5月10日到15日左右（预料那时执政党将再次企图强行结束国会关于新“安全条约”的辩论）和5月20日左右（那时自由民主党人可能提出动议，延长本届国会会期）。
    国民会议今天还讨论了第十五次全国统一行动的成就。会议认为，第十五次反对批准新“安全条约”统一行动，已经沉重地打击了岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党。因为，统一行动比预料的更加有力，规模更大。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：据日本国会统计，日本人民已经向国会递交了五百多万份请愿书，坚决反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”。
    由于许多请愿书是很多人联合签名的，所以签名人数远远超过请愿书的数目。
    另外，日本社会党书记长江田三郎今天说，社会党将征集两千万人反对批准新日美“安全条约”的签名。
    日本人民反对批准这个侵略性军事同盟条约的斗争正在胜利举行第十五次统一行动的基础上汹涌澎湃地发展。正在讨论新日美“安全条约”的日本国会每天都接到大量反对批准这个条约的请愿书。
    今天，日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎等人向众议院议长提交了在26日征集的关于反对批准新“安全条约”请愿书六万份。
    另外，京都大学教授立川文彦等三人今天会晤清濑议长，递交了二百三十七位教授和副教授签名的反对批准新“安全条约”的请愿书。由东京大学、东北大学、东京教育大学等全国的理学院研究人员等组成的“素粒子恳谈会”的代表今天也把反对批准新“安全条约”的请愿书递交给国会事务局。
    大约二十个大学和研究所的教授、助教和研究员的一百七十位代表向国会递交了五百封请愿书，反对批准新“安全条约”。写请愿书的人中包括一桥大学校长山中笃太郎、著名政治学学者沼田稻次郎和日本学术会议社会政策部的全体一百零四位研究员。
    这些请愿者还在国会旁边的大楼中举行会议。会议通过了一封给岸信介的题为“我们再次警告你”的信，要求岸信介解散国会并举行大选，以便将新日美“安全条约”问题转请人民来判断。
    社会党书记长江田三郎在会议上说，社会党将从明天起到5月2日期间把它的国会议员全部派到他们各自的选区中去，以便加强现在在各地展开的反对新“安全条约”宣传运动。
    由于运动的不断深入，日本的许多企业主也参加了斗争。日中贸易促进会今天在东京发表声明，宣布三十位贸易公司的代表反对批准新“安全条约”，并且呼吁其他贸易和制造业公司参加反对这个条约的请愿运动。
    这个组织在今天举行的会议上还决定，它的所有会员和会员家属都将参加它预定在5月2日举行的反对批准新“安全条约”和要求改善日中关系的请愿运动。会议还要求它的所有会员公司和团体在最近向国会举行反对批准这个条约的大规模的汽车队游行。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论指出，这几个星期将是日本人民反对批准新“安全条约”斗争的决定性时刻。社论号召全国所有民主力量运用一切斗争形式更有力地为反对新“安全条约”而斗争。
    社论指出，4月26日在日本展开的第十五次反对批准新“安全条约”全国统一行动具有极重大的意义。
    社论还指出，岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党企图在众议院通过新“安全条约”的阴谋暂时受到阻碍。但是，他们仍然企图欺骗人民，利用他们的随从强使国会批准这个条约。
    社论要求日本工人阶级在这个紧要时刻站在反对新“安全条约”斗争的最前列，并且号召在一切工作场所举行总罢工。社论说，“这是进一步发展4月26日斗争和使这种斗争发展成为更持久的力量的关键”。
    社论还说，南朝鲜人民的伟大斗争给予李承晚傀儡政权以致命的打击，这不是偶然的，“试图违反世界和平总趋势来领导国家的一切反动派肯定会得到同样的命运”。（附图片）
