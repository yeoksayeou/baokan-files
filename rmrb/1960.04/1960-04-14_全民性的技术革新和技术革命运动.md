National Mass Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement
中共哈尔滨市委第一书记　任仲夷 (First Secretary of the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee, Ren Zhongyi)

    For the past two years, due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership in all aspects of work, adherence to putting politics in command, launching vigorous mass movements, and adopting a method that combines production practice with scientific research, a new and flourishing situation has emerged in Harbin's technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In particular, in recent months, a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolutions, centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, has formed throughout the city. The emergence of this upsurge has pushed the city's technical revolution movement to a new stage of development. The technical appearance of major sectors of the national economy, such as industry, transportation, and basic construction, is undergoing a fundamental change.

              Three Characteristics
    The main characteristics of this technical innovation and technical revolution movement are:

    First, it is developing exceptionally rapidly, on an unprecedentedly grand scale, forming a national mass movement. Since October of last year, in less than half a year, the broad masses of workers throughout the city have been involved in this movement. From large enterprises to small enterprises, from production departments to non-production departments, from cities to villages, technical revolution flowers are blooming everywhere, and various inventions and creations are emerging in an endless stream. Factory workers have created various automated production lines, automated machine tools, and mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment. Basic construction workers have created automated concrete production lines, new technology experimental building "cold working construction," "warm air furnaces," and various rapid construction experiences. Loading and unloading workers have created various mechanized and automated handling tools. Many restaurants have achieved "no walking to deliver dishes, no hands to cut vegetables, no kneading to mix dough, operation by pressing buttons," and have created various ingenious automated machines for making dumplings, steamed buns, pancakes, and so on. Salespersons have created automatic vending machines, packaging machines, and money counting machines. Typists have created electric typewriters and automated mimeograph machines. Cleaners have created sweeping machines and automated cleaning vehicles. Nannies have created multi-purpose beds and automatic urine alarms. Fire brigades have created various automated fire-fighting devices. Breeders have achieved mechanized pig raising, with one person able to feed three thousand pigs. In short, a situation has emerged throughout the city where everyone is innovating, everything is innovating, every day is innovating, and everywhere is innovating. The momentum and scale of this movement are so great that in Harbin, it can only be compared to the flood control struggle participated in by the people of the city in 1957 and the national mass steel smelting movement in 1958.

    Second, the movement is developing exceptionally deeply, forming a comprehensive technical transformation movement. The large number of technical innovations and creations that have emerged in this movement are no longer sporadic and partial technical reforms, but have developed from single innovations to comprehensive technical transformations of the entire work process, the entire enterprise, and even the entire industry. The heroic slogan "Old soldiers change to new guns, old factories get new clothes, new soldiers become old soldiers, new factories become even newer, one person is worth several people, one factory is worth several factories" has become the fighting program for the broad masses of workers throughout the city. After the soft shaft workshop of the Electric Meter and Instrument Factory achieved full automation, it has been reduced from forty-two people to a workshop with only two people. The Jincheng Hardware Factory in Daowai District, which produces hairpins, thimbles, and saw blades for cotton gins, has also fully automated its production. Many workers who used old-fashioned belt lathes have replaced them with automated and semi-automated "new guns." In this movement, while vigorously promoting mechanization and automation, the comprehensive development of various technologies has also been greatly promoted. Many major advanced experiences have been created in design, process reform, comprehensive utilization of materials, and various tool reforms, as well as in "ring power supply, ring water supply, ring gas supply, and ring transportation." This movement has also greatly promoted the comprehensive development of various technologies.

    Third, this technical innovation and technical revolution movement is closely integrated with the national mass movement to study Mao Zedong's works, the national mass cultural revolution movement, and the mass movement to develop collective welfare undertakings and comprehensively organize the people's economic life. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, and the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee proposed "new situation, new stage, new tasks," not only has a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution movement been launched throughout the city, but also a new upsurge of studying Marxism-Leninism centered on studying Mao Zedong Thought has been launched first. Due to the in-depth development of this movement, the political consciousness of the broad masses has been greatly improved. In the past six months, a new upsurge of cultural revolution movement centered on popularizing and improving national education and climbing the peak of science, and a mass movement centered on developing collective welfare undertakings, comprehensively organizing the people's economic life, and thoroughly transforming social life have also been launched throughout the city. In these movements, the communist morality of the broad masses has been greatly promoted, and the relationship between people has been further improved, thereby greatly improving the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in building socialism.

    These four national mass movements, with the study of Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, with the development of production as the center, are closely intertwined, conditional on each other, promote each other, and converge into a huge revolutionary torrent. This torrent has refreshed people's mental outlook and greatly promoted the high-speed development of production. It makes all aspects of socialist construction present a situation of daily renewal, continuous renewal, and renewed renewal.

                Eight Major Benefits
    From the situation in Harbin, this movement has brought eight major benefits to production:

    First, production efficiency has been greatly improved. The automatic thread tapping production line of the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory has reduced the working hours for producing a thread tap from eighteen seconds to six seconds, and the annual output has increased from 300,000 pieces to 2.7 million pieces. The semi-automatic trapezoidal thread cold rolling mill created by the Boiler Factory has reduced the working hours per product from eighteen minutes to six seconds, increasing efficiency by 180 times. On rural water conservancy construction sites, the efficiency has been increased by more than ten times due to the creation of the "hanging hammer soil splitter" and the single-track "roller horse."

    Second, it has improved working conditions and reduced labor intensity. The No. 8 District Grain Processing Factory has basically become a "dust-free workshop" due to the mechanization and automation of grain storage, transportation, and processing. After the Xiangfang Wood Processing Factory achieved mechanization, the workers sang: "In the past, the log yard, loading and unloading relied on shoulders; carrying wood and shouting, hot sweat streaming down the face;... back pain and aching muscles, accidents happened easily. Now the log yard has completely changed; no more shouting, only the sound of machines;... live to be over ninety, the whole family is happy. Spirit is good, throat is itchy; sing praises to Chairman Mao, thank the Communist Party." After the workers of the Pig Bristle Factory achieved mechanization and automation, they have forever escaped the threat of occupational diseases such as high blood pressure, hand numbness, tooth loss, and bronchitis.

    Third, it has greatly saved labor. The Zhaodong Fur Factory has achieved automated cotton ginning, reducing the number of workers from 120 to 45. The Electric Meter and Instrument Factory has formed a new workshop with the 200 workers saved since the technical revolution. The Daowai Knitting Factory has saved 300 workers by eliminating the thread-pounding process. Since January and February of this year, Harbin has basically not increased the number of workers. However, the total industrial output value in January increased by 24% compared to December of last year, and February increased by 13% compared to January. Since October of last year, the city has saved more than 50,000 workers.

    Fourth, it has improved product quality and created many high-quality, large-scale, sophisticated, and new products. The automatic spring coiling machine created by the Weijian Machine Factory not only increased efficiency by 96 times, but also increased the qualified rate from 74% to 100%. The welding flux automated production line of the Boiler Factory reduced the moisture content of the welding flux from 2.5% to 0.7%. In just two or three months, the city has created more than 450 kinds of high-quality, large-scale, sophisticated, and new products.

    Fifth, it has saved a lot of operating area. The automatic flax canvas processing line created by the Flax Factory has reduced the production area from more than 1,300 square meters to 600 square meters. After the Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory reformed the production process of "saponin," eight processes were combined into four, saving an operating area of more than 3,000 square meters.

    Sixth, it has saved a lot of equipment and materials and reduced costs. After the Cigarette Factory made the production linkage line, it saved more than 100 pieces of various equipment and more than 2,900 pieces of various tools. The spray dyeing machine created by the Knitting Factory can save more than 3,000 tons of raw coal and 12.5 tons of dyes throughout the year, and it has also saved a lot of equipment such as dewatering machines, dyeing machines, and boilers. The "rubber shoe punching machine" created by the Songjiang Rubber Factory can save more than 130 tons of gasoline and more than 20 tons of raw rubber annually after being promoted throughout the factory, reducing costs by 9.12%. After the Pig Bristle Factory vigorously carried out the technical revolution, the cost was reduced by 40%.

    Seventh, it has shortened the production cycle. The new calendering method adopted by the Xinfeng Processing Factory has reduced the production cycle from three days to fifteen minutes. The automatic lead screw machine tool of the Harbin Machine Tool Factory has reduced the production cycle from twenty-four hours to one and a half hours. After the Litai Paperboard Factory created the automatic production line, the production cycle was shortened from seven days to six hours.

    Eighth, it has greatly improved the scientific and technical level of the masses. In this movement, due to the close combination of production practice and scientific research, countless "designers," "engineers," and "all-rounders" have emerged among the workers. In their production practice, they have overturned many outdated conclusions about science and technology and created new theories, once again proving the truth that theory comes from practice.

    In short, this movement has many benefits and a great role. In the final analysis, it has greatly improved social labor productivity. According to rough estimates, the city can save more than 100,000 people this year, and the labor productivity of the industrial sector can be increased by about 60% compared to last year. Under the condition of striving for no increase in the city's population and some enterprises even reducing the number of people, the total industrial output value can reach more than 7 billion to 8 billion yuan, an increase of 69.7% to 90% compared to last year.

    The emergence of a new upsurge in Harbin's technical innovation and technical revolution movement is not accidental. This is mainly due to: the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Provincial Party Committee; the general line of socialist construction is becoming increasingly popular; since the national rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, the masses' political awareness has been unprecedentedly improved; the Party's leadership has been strengthened in all aspects of work, and the implementation of putting politics in command and launching vigorous mass movements has been adhered to; the continuous great leap forward in the past two years has created an unprecedentedly solid material foundation for the technical revolution and the cultural revolution; the broad masses and all cadres have accumulated rich experience; especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the right-leaning opportunism and conservative thinking were thoroughly criticized, which further encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. In a word, all the victories achieved by Harbin in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are the victories of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the victories of the three magic weapons of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune.

                Ten Experiences
    First, ideological revolution promotes technical revolution. The victory of the technical revolution first depends on the victory of the ideological revolution; only the liberation of people's minds can promote the liberation of productive forces. The moving example of the Pig Bristle Factory's vigorous technical revolution is the most convincing. This factory is an old factory left over from the puppet Manchukuo, with extremely poor working conditions. The workers have been using backward methods of production with their hands and teeth for more than a century. It is the urgent desire of all workers to fundamentally change this backward production method. However, it is indeed not an easy task to create a mechanized and automated device to make a pile of messy pig bristles obediently neat with the roots down and the tips up, and also to separate them into different sizes and tie them into bundles. In this technical innovation and technical revolution movement, it was created by the workers. The emergence of this miracle started from the ideological revolution and breaking with superstition. In order to overcome numerous difficulties, the factory's Party committee conducted ideological education on liberating the mind and breaking with superstition among all employees. After extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions, it put forward the call to rely on self-reliance to achieve mechanization and automation. As a result, a mass movement of designing and manufacturing equipment by themselves was immediately launched among all workers. Within a few days, more than 100 kinds of mechanized and automated models and drawings were made. These pig bristle workers, who were regarded as "rustic" by skeptics not long ago, quickly turned into fitters, carpenters, assemblers, designers, and inventors. Based on decades of work experience, the workers cleverly created sophisticated mechanized and automated devices, which mechanized and automated most of the production process. This example fully demonstrates that technical revolution and ideological revolution are mutually influential. Only continuous revolution in ideology can lead to continuous revolution in technology, and the development of technical revolution will in turn promote the further liberation of people's minds, and so on and so forth, to infinity.

    Second, timely discovery and enthusiastic support for emerging new things in the movement. In order to support the growth of emerging new things, we often pay attention to treating new things with the attitude of proletarian revolutionaries, and often conduct ideological education on how to correctly treat new things to cadres through personal practice. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, leading cadres often go deep into the grassroots level. Whenever new things appear, they take various measures to encourage and support them, and actively create conditions to promote their realization. The municipal Party committee and leaders of Party and government organizations at all levels also frequently and promptly hold various on-site meetings, organize exhibitions, display various inventions and creations in a timely manner, vigorously promote various advanced experiences, raise red flags, and widely establish model workers; through newspapers and radio stations, a large number of advanced experiences in various fields are reported. These methods have been widely used not only on the industrial front, but also on the financial and trade, cultural, and educational fronts, not only in the technical revolution, but also in other work.

    The experience of the recent technical innovation and technical revolution movement proves that the more in-depth the movement, the more new things there are; the more timely and supportive the leadership is for the growth of new things, the more widely and deeply the movement will develop. In October last year, the first batch of automated production lines appeared in the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, the No. 2 Tool Factory, and the Cigarette Factory. As soon as these new things appeared, they received the support of the Party. The Provincial Party Committee and the Municipal Party Committee promptly held on-site meetings and timely put forward the call to march towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. In this way, a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation was quickly set off throughout the city. Recently, the experience of remote control, remote measurement, and remote reporting signals has begun to appear in some factories and enterprises. The emergence of these new things marks that Harbin's technical innovation and technical revolution movement is developing in a deeper, wider, and higher direction.

    Third, implement the "walking on two legs" policy. In this movement, we not only focus on modern large factories, but also focus on small factories with backward equipment; we not only focus on national industry, but also focus on district, street, township, and community industries; we not only focus on automation and semi-automation, but also focus on mechanization and semi-mechanization; we not only focus on foreign methods, but also focus on indigenous methods, using foreign methods if possible, and indigenous methods if not. In the spirit of this, in vigorously promoting automation, we not only focus on automated production lines, but also focus on single-machine automation; we not only focus on advanced program-controlled machine tools using photoelectric and acoustic-electric manipulation, but also focus on mechanical linkage automated machine tools that do not use electrical materials. We also often emphasize that we must not only focus on popularization, but also focus on improvement; we must not only focus on the key to current production, but also focus on technical reforms with long-term significance; we must not only emphasize daring to think and daring to act, but also advocate scientific analysis... and so on. Experience has proven that the "walking on two legs" policy proposed by the Party is a correct reflection of the law of the unity of opposites in objective things. As long as we conscientiously implement the "walking on two legs" policy, we can make the mass movement develop more and more deeply and widely, and we can ensure the rapid and healthy development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    Fourth, promote the communist style of cooperation and widely promote the experience of "three combinations" inside and outside the enterprise. This experience has been widely used and developed in this movement. Now, all enterprises in the city generally adopt the "three combinations" method, and have established various organizations such as the Academy of Sciences, research institutes, technical research groups, technical revolution work teams, and advanced experience promotion teams. On the sites of various factories, workshops, and construction sites throughout the city, this kind of internal and external "three combinations" activity can be seen almost everywhere. Harbin Institute of Technology sent more than 2,300 teachers and students to jointly design and manufacture a large number of mechanized and automated equipment with factory workers, and participated in the reform of the city's "four-in-one" ring power supply. Practice has proven that the "three combinations" method is the best way to combine leadership with the masses, combine production practice with scientific research, fully mobilize all positive factors, implement the mass line, and promote communist cooperation. Many major technical reforms in Harbin are almost all the crystallization of this cooperation. For example, the new "building block" machine tool successfully created not long ago is the product of the cooperation between Harbin Institute of Technology and the Jilian Machinery Factory; the automatic thread tapping production line is the product of the cooperation between the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory and the Tool Research Institute; and the "new technology experimental building" is the product of the cooperation between the construction unit and the design department and scientific research department. Due to the promotion of the communist style of cooperation, a new ethos of "helping others is a pleasure, sacrificing oneself is an honor, one place innovates, all places support" has now generally emerged throughout the city.

    Fifth, fully mobilize the masses and widely carry out the "production sports meeting." Harbin's "production sports meeting" was learned from Jiamusi, and has been further developed through the practice of the broad masses. Many facts show that the "production sports meeting" is a new form of labor competition. Its main advantages are: due to layer-by-layer competitions and layer-by-layer selections, it is convenient to raise red flags and widely establish model workers, which can fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of all employees and involve the broad masses in the competition. Because it focuses on improving technology and combines competition of indicators with competition of technology, it can effectively promote the continuous development of technical innovation and technical revolution and the continuous leap forward in production; because everyone participates in technical performances, it can fully exert the wisdom and talents of the masses and effectively match and promote experience, so that the advanced experience of a few people can quickly become the wealth of the entire society; because the "production sports meeting" is held in sessions, there is both continuity and stages between the sessions, which conforms to the principle of combining hard work and rest; because of the holding of the "production sports meeting," labor productivity is continuously improved, thereby greatly promoting the continuous improvement of enterprise management. In order to further promote the continuous upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we are further strengthening the Party's leadership over the "production sports meeting" and making it more widely used.

    Sixth, while vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, it is necessary to improve enterprise management in a timely and corresponding manner. A certain mode of production and level of productivity require a certain management system and method that are compatible with it. The emergence of each major technical innovation will greatly improve the production level of the enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously and timely improve enterprise management to adapt to the continuous improvement of technical reform and productivity level. At the same time, due to the continuous improvement of enterprise management, it will in turn further promote the continuous advancement of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The leadership responsibility of the Party organization in the enterprise lies in consciously recognizing and applying this law and continuously promoting the development of production. According to the experience of many enterprises in Harbin, the following aspects of work must be grasped in improving enterprise management: (1) According to the new situation of mechanization and automation, timely improve production organization and labor organization, and appropriately adjust the wage and bonus system; (2) Strengthen the maintenance and care of mechanized and automated equipment, continuously improve process procedures and operating procedures, and strengthen product quality inspection work; (3) Further strengthen plan management and earnestly do a good job in production preparation and technical preparation; (4) Improve and strengthen financial cost management work to make it more adaptable to the needs of continuous improvement of productivity; (5) On the basis of continuously improving the level of mechanization and automation, further develop and improve the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations."

    Recently, many new experiences have emerged in many enterprises in Harbin in improving enterprise management: workers have participated in production management and technical management, and then participated in scientific research work. Only a part of the workers in the Xinfeng Processing Factory wrote more than 220 technical papers; a large number of management tool reforms have emerged, such as simplified accounting assembly lines, statistical calculation automatic lines, equipment start-stop signal machines, material and tool supply signal machines, and so on. Some enterprises have also launched competitions in the form of "production sports meetings" among the staff of departments, which has powerfully promoted the improvement of management work. These new experiences must be enthusiastically supported and seriously studied and vigorously promoted. This is of great significance for rapidly improving the level of enterprise management and further promoting the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    Seventh, while vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, it is necessary to vigorously carry out the cultural revolution. The large-scale emergence of mechanized and automated equipment places higher demands on the scientific, technological, and cultural level of the broad masses of workers. Without rapidly improving the cultural level and scientific and technological level of the workers, not only will the role of mechanized and automated equipment not be fully utilized, but also the further improvement of the degree of mechanization and automation will be affected. Because the degree of mechanization and automation is getting higher and higher, although the requirements for workers' operation skills are greatly simplified, higher requirements are put forward for the scientific knowledge and technology in the maintenance and repair of these equipment. For example, the soft shaft workshop of the Electric Meter and Instrument Factory originally had forty-two employees. Since the realization of automatic production, only two people are enough. These two workers are both producers and managers, both machine operators and adjusters. Production requires them not only to press the button, but also to understand the structure of this equipment, not only to be able to operate it for normal production, but also to be able to skillfully inspect and maintain it. There are many such examples. Therefore, while vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution, vigorously carrying out the cultural revolution and rapidly improving the cultural and scientific and technological level of the broad masses has become a very urgent task.

    Eighth, formulate technical revolution plans. In order to guide the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to the most necessary and most effective direction, each enterprise and department needs to formulate a technical innovation and technical revolution plan. This is an important measure to strengthen the Party's leadership over the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. When formulating technical revolution plans, it is necessary to combine solving the key to current production with long-term plans, and combine sporadic and partial reforms with comprehensive and fundamental reforms. Like formulating production plans, formulating technical innovation and technical revolution plans must also follow the mass line and adopt the "three combinations" method to mobilize the masses for discussion. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the masses be fully mobilized, and can we gather wisdom and benefit and formulate the plan on a basis that is both advanced and reliable.

    Ninth, sum up experience. In this movement, due to the efforts of the broad masses and all cadres, the experience in all aspects is extremely rich. The current problem is to require us to conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "from the masses, to the masses," "concentrate and persist," and timely and systematically sum up the various experiences in the movement. Only in this way can we quickly and effectively promote various advanced experiences, can we turn scattered experiences into systematic experiences, can we raise the city's technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new level in accordance with the law of practice-cognition-re-practice-re-cognition pointed out by Chairman Mao, and can we guide the broad masses to continuously move from one victory to another.

    Tenth, learn with an open mind. The reason why Harbin has been able to achieve some success in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, in addition to relying on the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee and the efforts of the broad masses and all cadres, is also inseparable from the enthusiastic help of fraternal regions and our open-minded learning from others. Many of the advanced experiences promoted in Harbin were learned from other places. Experience has proven that to have great ambitions, we must first be humble; to surpass the blue, we must come from the blue. Only by being neither inferior nor arrogant, learning with an open mind, overcoming shortcomings, and developing a style of being both energetic and daring to think and act, and being conscientious and cautious, combining open-minded learning and originality, can our cause continue to advance.

      "Four Modernizations," "Three Remotes," "Eight-Pronged Advance"
    Although Harbin's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has achieved remarkable results and accumulated some experience, there are still many problems that need to be solved urgently in the process of rapid development. For example, in the entire movement, there are still backward units and weak links. Some automated equipment has not been put into normal production, workers' operation is not skilled enough, and many advanced experiences have not been promoted enough. The level of enterprise management still needs to be improved urgently. Seriously studying and quickly solving these problems has become an important key to promoting the continued advancement of the movement. In order to make the technical innovation and technical revolution movement continue to develop rapidly and healthily, the Municipal Party Committee recently proposed the policy of consolidating achievements, improving quality, continuing development, and striding forward. According to this policy, we call on all employees to fight for 100 days and realize the "thousand, hundred, ten thousand" ahead of schedule (one thousand automated production lines, one hundred automated workshops, ten thousand automated single machines), and basically realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operation and heavy labor. Recently, according to the development of the movement, we have also put forward the combat slogan of "Four Modernizations," "Three Remotes," and "Eight-Pronged Advance," calling on the broad masses of employees to strive to climb the peak of science and technology and vigorously engage in "high-quality, large-scale, sophisticated, and new." The so-called "Four Modernizations" are mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. The so-called "Three Remotes" is to require continuous revolution on the basis of realizing automation and semi-automation, and further realize remote control, remote measurement, and remote communication. The so-called "Eight-Pronged Advance" is to advance towards the "Four Modernizations," advance towards the "Three Remotes," advance towards chipless processing, advance towards cutting tool reform, advance towards comprehensive utilization of materials, advance towards design reform, advance towards process reform, and advance towards various management tool reforms. These slogans have been warmly responded to by the broad masses of employees throughout the city. It can be predicted that in the near future, the economic, cultural, and technical outlook of Harbin will undergo newer changes. The people of Harbin are determined to make more contributions to the great cause of realizing the comprehensive technical transformation of the national economy, supporting the socialist construction of the province and the whole country, and building our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science.

    全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动	中共哈尔滨市委第一书记　任仲夷
    两年来，由于加强了党对各方面工作的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，并且采取了生产实践同科学研究相结合的方法，哈尔滨市的技术革新和技术革命运动出现了一个蓬勃发展的新局面。特别是最近几个月以来，在全市形成了一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新与技术革命的新高潮。这个高潮的出现，把全市的技术革命运动推上了一个新的发展阶段。全市工业交通、基本建设等国民经济主要部门的技术面貌，正在经历着一个根本性的变化。
              三个特征
    这次技术革新和技术革命运动的主要特征是：
    第一，发展异常迅速，规模空前壮阔，形成全民性的运动。自从去年10月以来，不到半年的时间，全市广大职工群众，都卷入了这个运动。从大型企业到小型企业，从生产部门到非生产部门，从城市到乡村，到处盛开技术革命之花，各种发明创造层出不穷。工厂职工创造了各种各样的自动化生产线、自动化机床和机械化、半机械化设备。基本建设职工创造了混凝土自动化生产线、新技术实验楼“冷作施工”、“暖风炉”、和各种快速施工经验。装卸工人创制了各种机械化、自动化搬运工具。许多饭店都实现了“送菜不用走，切菜不用手，合面不用揉，操作按电钮”，并且创造出各种巧妙的包饺子，做馒头，烙煎饼等等自动化的机器。售货员创制了自动售货机、包装机和点钞机。打字员创造了电动打字机和自动化油印机。清扫人员创造了扫地机和自动化清扫车。保育员创制了综合利用床和自动报尿器。消防队创造了各种自动化消防装置。饲养员实现了养猪机械化，一人能喂三千头猪。总之，全市已经出现了一个人人革新，事事革新，天天革新，处处革新的局面。这次运动声势和规模之大，在哈尔滨市来说，只有1957年全市人民参加的防洪斗争和1958年的全民大炼钢铁运动可与伦比。
    第二，运动发展异常深入，形成全面的技术改造运动。这次运动中出现的大量的技术革新和创造，已经不是零星的局部的技术改革，而是从单项革新发展到全工序、全企业以至全行业的全面的技术改造。“老兵换新枪，老厂改新装，新兵变老兵，新厂更尖新，一人顶数人，一厂顶数厂”这一豪迈的口号，已经成了全市广大职工的斗争纲领。电表仪器厂软轴车间，实现全面自动化以后，已经由四十二人减为只有两个人的车间。道外区街工业金城五金厂生产发卡、顶针、弹棉齿锯条等产品，也全部实现了自动化。许多使用旧式皮带车床操作的工人，都换上了自动化、半自动化的“新枪”。在这次运动中，在大搞机械化、自动化的同时，还大大推动了各种技术的全面发展，在设计、工艺改革，材料综合利用和各种工具改革以及“环形供电、环形供水、环形供气、环形运输”等方面，创造了许多重大的先进经验。这次运动还大大推动了各种技术的全面发展。
    第三，这次技术革新和技术革命运动，是同全民性的学习毛泽东著作运动、全民性的文化革命运动和发展集体福利事业、全面组织人民经济生活的群众运动紧密结合的。自从党的八届八中全会提出反右倾、鼓干劲和中共黑龙江省委提出“新形势、新阶段、新任务”以来，在全市范围内，不仅掀起了一个技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮，而且首先掀起了一个以学习毛泽东思想为中心的学习马克思列宁主义的新高潮。由于这个运动的深入开展，大大地提高了广大群众的政治觉悟。最近半年来，在全市还掀起了一个以普及提高全民教育、攀登科学高峰为中心的文化革命运动的新高潮，和一个以发展集体福利事业为中心，全面组织人民经济生活，对社会生活进行彻底改造的群众运动。在这些运动中，广大群众的共产主义道德风尚大为发扬了，人与人的关系进一步改善，从而大大提高了广大群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性。
    这四个全民性的群众运动，是以学习毛泽东思想为统帅，以发展生产为中心，紧紧地交织在一起，互为条件，互相促进，并且汇成一股巨大的革命洪流。这股洪流使人们的精神面貌焕然一新，大大促进了生产的高速度发展。使社会主义建设的各个方面，都呈现出苟日新、日日新，又日新的局面。
                八大好处
    从哈尔滨市的情况来看，这次运动给生产带来了八大好处：
    第一，生产效率大为提高。量具刃具厂的丝锥自动化生产线，使生产一个丝锥的工时由十八秒减为六秒，年产量由三十万件提高到二百七十万件。锅炉厂创造的半自动梯形螺纹冷轧机，使每件产品工时由十八分减为六秒，提高效率一百八十倍。在农村水利建设工地上，由于创造了“吊锤劈土器”和单轨“轱辘马”，工效提高十余倍。
    第二，改善了劳动条件，减轻了劳动强度。八区粮食加工厂由于实现了粮食的储、运、加工机械化、自动化，基本变成了“无尘车间”。香坊木材加工厂实现机械化后，工人们唱道：“过去原木场，装卸靠肩膀；抬木呼号叫，热汗满脸淌；……腰酸筋骨疼，失手就受伤。现在原木场，彻底变了样；号子听不见，但闻机器响；……高寿过九十，全家喜洋洋。精神爽，嗓子痒；歌颂毛主席，感谢共产党。”猪鬃工厂工人在实现机械化、自动化后，已经永远摆脱了高血压、手麻、齿落、支气管炎等等职业病的威胁。 
    第三，大大节省了劳动力。肇东皮毛厂实现了弹棉自动化，工人由一百二十名减为四十五名。电表仪器厂自从大闹技术革命以来，用节省出的二百名工人，组成了新的车间。道外针织厂，由于取消了捣线工序，节省了三百名工人。今年1、2月份以来，哈尔滨市基本上没有增加工人。而1月份工业总产值却比去年12月提高24％，2月又比1月提高13％。自从去年10月以来，全市共节省五万多工人。
    第四，提高了产品质量，创造了许多高大精尖新的产品。伟建机器厂创造的弹簧自动缠绕机，不仅提高效率九十六倍，合格率也由74％增为100％。锅炉厂的焊药自动化生产线，使焊药含水量由2.5％降为0.7％。仅仅在两、三个月的时间内，全市共创造出四百五十多种高、大、精、尖、新的产品。
    第五，节省了大量作业面积。亚麻厂创制的亚麻帆布加工自动线，使生产面积由一千三百多平方米减为六百平方米。哈尔滨药厂在改革了生产“皂素”的工艺以后，八道工序合为四道，节省作业面积三千多平方米。
    第六，节约了大量的设备和材料，降低了成本。卷烟厂制成生产联动线后，节省各种设备一百多台，各种工具二千九百多件。针织厂创制的喷雾染色机，全年可节约原煤三千多吨，染料十二吨半，并且节省了脱水机、染色机和锅炉等大量设备。松江橡胶厂创制的“胶鞋冲压机”，全厂推广后，年可节约汽油一百三十多吨，生胶二十多吨，降低成本9.12％。猪鬃工厂大闹技术革命以后，成本降低40％。
    第七，缩短了生产周期。新风加工厂采用新的压延方法，生产周期由三天减为十五分钟。哈尔滨机床厂的丝杠自动化机床，使生产周期由二十四小时减为一小时半。利泰纸板厂创造生产自动线以后，生产周期由七天缩短为六小时。
    第八，大大提高了群众的科学技术水平。在这次运动中，由于生产实践和科学研究密切结合，在工人群众中，出现了无数“设计师”、“工程师”和“多面手”。他们在生产实践中，推翻了许多陈旧的关于科学技术的论断，并且创造了新的理论，再一次证明了理论来源于实践的真理。
    总之，这次运动的好处很多，作用很大，归根到底，都是大大提高了社会劳动生产率。根据粗略的估算，今年全市大约可节省十余万人，工业部门的劳动生产率可比去年提高60％左右。在力争全市不增人，有些企业还要减人的条件下，工业总产值可达到七十多亿元到八十亿元，比去年提高69.7％至90％。
    哈尔滨市技术革新与技术革命运动新高潮的出现，并不是偶然的。这主要是由于：党中央、毛主席和省委的正确领导；社会主义建设总路线愈来愈深入人心；全民整风和反右派斗争以来，群众政治觉悟空前提高；在各项工作中加强了党的领导，坚持实行了政治挂帅、大搞群众运动；两年来的连续大跃进，为技术革命和文化革命创造了前所未有的雄厚的物质基础；广大群众和全体干部，都积累了丰富的经验；特别是党的八届八中全会以后，彻底批判了右倾机会主义和保守思想，进一步鼓舞了人民群众的革命干劲。一句话，哈尔滨市在技术革新和技术革命运动中所取得的一切胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝的胜利。
                十条体会
    第一，思想革命推动技术革命。技术革命的胜利，首先取决于思想革命的胜利；只有人的思想解放，才能促进生产力的解放。猪鬃工厂大闹技术革命的动人事例是最有说服力的。这个厂子是伪满遗留下来的一个旧厂，劳动条件极坏，工人们沿用着一个多世纪以来用手和牙齿进行生产的落后办法。从根本上改变这种落后的生产方法，是全体工人的迫切愿望。但是要创造一种机械化、自动化的设备，把一堆乱七八糟的猪鬃，使它们驯服地整整齐齐的根朝下、尖朝上，并且还要从中分出不同的尺寸，一束一束地扎起来，确实不是一件容易的事情。在这次技术革新和技术革命运动中，却被工人们创造出来了。这个奇迹的出现，就是从思想革命、破除迷信开始的。为了冲破重重困难，该厂党委向全体职工进行了解放思想、破除迷信的思想教育，经过大鸣、大放、大辩论，提出了自力更生，实现机械化、自动化的号召。结果，在全体工人中立即掀起了一个自己搞设计、造设备的群众运动。几天之内，就制出了一百多种机械化、自动化的模型和图纸。这些不久以前还被怀疑论者看成“土头土脑”的猪鬃工人，很快地变成了钳工、木工、装配工、设计师和发明家。工人们根据几十年的劳动经验，巧夺天功，制做出精巧的机械化、自动化装置，使大部分生产过程实现了机械化和自动化。这个事例充分地说明，技术革命和思想革命是互相作用的。只有思想上的不断革命，才能有技术上的不断革命，而技术革命的发展，又会反过来促进人们思想的进一步解放，如此循环往复，以至无穷。
    第二，及时发现和热情地支持运动中出现的新生事物。为了支持新生事物的成长，我们经常注意以无产阶级革命家态度对待新生事物，并且经常通过切身实践向干部进行正确对待新生事物的思想教育。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，领导干部经常深入基层，遇有新鲜事物出现，就采取各种办法加以鼓励和支持，并且积极创造条件，促其实现。市委和各级党政领导组织，还经常和及时召开各种现场会议，组织展览，及时陈列各种发明和创造，大力推广各种先进经验，大举红旗，广树标兵；通过报纸和电台，大量报道各方面的先进经验。这些方法，不仅在工业战线上，而且在财贸、文教战线上，不仅在技术革命方面，而且在其他工作方面也都得到了广泛的运用。
    最近技术革新和技术革命运动的经验证明，运动愈是深入，新生事物就愈多；领导上愈能及时发现和支持新生事物的成长，运动就发展得愈加广泛和深入。去年10月间，在量具刃具厂、第二工具厂、卷烟厂出现了第一批自动化生产线。这些新生事物一经出现，就得到了党的支持。省委和市委都迅即召开了现场会议，并且及时提出了向机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化进军的号召。这样，就在全市很快地掀起了一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮。最近，在一些工厂企业里开始出现了遥远控制、遥远测量和遥远报讯号的经验。这些新鲜事物的出现，标志着哈尔滨市的技术革新和技术革命运动正向更深、更广、更高的方向发展。
    第三、贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针。在这次运动中，我们既抓现代化的大厂，也抓设备落后的小厂；既抓国家工业，也抓区街和乡社工业；既抓自动化、半自动化，也抓机械化、半机械化；既抓洋的，也抓土的，能洋就洋，不能洋就土。本着这个精神，我们在大搞自动化方面，既抓自动化生产线，也抓单机自动化；既抓用光电和声电操纵的高级的程序控制机床，也抓不使用电气材料的机械联动自动化机床。我们还经常强调，既要抓普及，又要抓提高；既要抓当前生产关键，又要抓带有长远意义的技术改革；既强调敢想敢干，又提倡科学分析……等等。经验证明，党所提出的“两条腿走路”的方针，乃是客观事物矛盾统一规律的正确反映，只要认真贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，就能使群众运动愈来愈深，愈来愈广的发展，就能保证技术革新和技术革命运动迅速而又健康的发展。
    第四，大兴共产主义协作之风，普遍推行企业内外“三结合”的经验。这个经验，在这次运动中得到了广泛的运用和发展。现在，全市所有企业，普遍采用“三结合”的办法，建立了科学院、研究所、技术研究小组，技术革命工作队、先进经验推广队等各种组织。在全市各工厂、车间、工地等现场上，几乎到处都可以看到这种内外“三结合”的活动。哈尔滨工业大学，出动了二千三百余师生，和工厂职工共同设计和制造了大量的机械化、自动化设备，并且参与了全市“四合一”环形供电的改革。实践证明，“三结合”的方法，是领导与群众相结合，生产实践与科学研究相结合，充分调动一切积极因素，贯彻群众路线，大搞共产主义协作的一种最好的方法。哈尔滨市很多重大的技术改革，几乎都是这种协作的结晶。例如不久以前创造成功的新式“积木式”机床，是哈尔滨工业大学与机联机械厂合作的产物；丝锥自动化生产线，是量具刃具厂与工具研究所合作的产物；“新技术试验楼”，是施工单位和设计部门、科学研究部门合作的产物。由于大兴共产主义协作之风，现在全市已经普遍出现了“助人为乐、舍己为荣、一处革新、处处支援”的新风尚。
    第五，全面发动群众，广泛开展“生产运动会”。哈尔滨市的“生产运动会”，是从佳木斯学来的，经过广大群众的实践，又有了新的发展。很多事实说明，“生产运动会”是劳动竞赛的一种新形式。它的好处主要是：由于层层比赛，层层选拔，便于大举红旗，广树标兵，可以充分调动全体职工的生产积极性，把广大群众都卷入到竞赛中来。由于它以提高技术为中心，赛指标与赛技术相结合，可以有效地推动技术革新和技术革命不断发展和生产不断跃进；由于人人参加技术表演，可以充分发挥群众的智慧和才能，有效地把经验配套推广，使少数人的先进经验迅速变为全社会的财富；由于“生产运动会”分届举行，在各届之间，既有连续性，又有阶段性，合乎苦战与休整相结合的原则；由于举行“生产运动会”，劳动生产率不断提高，从而大大推动了企业管理的不断改进。为了进一步促进技术革新和技术革命运动的不断高涨，我们正在进一步加强党对“生产运动会”的领导，并且把它更加广泛地运用起来。
    第六，大闹技术革命，必须及时和相应地改进企业管理。一定的生产方式和生产力水平，要求一定的与之相适应的管理制度和方法，每件重大技术革新的出现，都会大大提高企业的生产水平，因此就要求不断地和及时地改进企业管理，以适应技术改革和生产力水平不断提高的需要。同时，由于企业管理的不断改进，反过来又会进一步推动技术革新和技术革命运动不断前进。企业中党组织的领导责任，就在于自觉地认识和运用这个规律，不断促进生产的发展。根据哈尔滨市很多企业的经验，在改进企业管理方面，必须抓紧以下几方面的工作：（1）根据机械化、自动化的新情况，及时改进生产组织和劳动组织，适当地调整工资、奖励制度；（2）加强对于机械化、自动化设备的维修和养护，不断地改进工艺规程、操作规程，并且要加强产品质量的检查工作；（3）进一步加强计划管理，切实做好生产准备和技术准备；（4）改进和加强财务成本管理工作，使之更加适应生产力不断提高的需要；（5）在不断提高机械化、自动化水平的基础上，进一步发展和提高“两参一改三结合”的经验。
    最近期间，哈尔滨市很多企业，在改进企业管理方面，出现了许多新的经验：工人由参加生产管理、技术管理，进而参加了科学研究工作，仅仅新风加工厂的一部分工人，就写了二百二十多篇技术论文；出现了大量的管理工具的改革，如简化核算流水线、统计计算自动线、设备停开信号机、料具供应信号机等等。有些企业，在科室人员中，也以“生产运动会”的形式开展了竞赛，有力地推动了管理工作的改进。对于这些新的经验，必须加以热情的支持，并且要认真研究和大力推广。这对于迅速提高企业管理水平，进一步促进技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，具有重要意义。
    第七，在大搞技术革命的同时，必须大搞文化革命。机械化、自动化设备的大量涌现，对于广大职工群众的科学技术和文化水平的要求更高了。不迅速提高职工群众的文化水平和科学技术水平，不仅不能充分发挥机械化、自动化设备的作用，而且还会影响机械化、自动化程度的进一步提高。由于机械化、自动化程度越来越高，对于工人操纵技术的要求虽然大大简化了，但是，对于检修和维护这些设备方面的科学知识和技术，却提出了更高的要求。如电表仪器厂的软轴车间，原来有四十二名职工，自从实现自动生产以后，只要两个人就够了，这两名工人既是生产者，又是管理者，既是机械操纵者，又是调整工。生产要求他们不仅会按电钮，而且要懂得这台设备的构造，不仅能够操纵它进行正常生产，而且能够熟练地进行检查和维修。像这样的例子是很多的。所以，在大闹技术革新和技术革命的同时，大闹文化革命，迅速提高广大群众的文化和科学技术水平，已经成为非常迫切的任务。
    第八，制订技术革命规划。为了把群众的革命热情引导到最必需而又最有效的方向上去，每个企业和部门都需要制订一个技术革新和技术革命的规划。这是加强党对技术革新和技术革命运动领导的一个重要措施。在制订技术革命规划的时候，必须把解决当前的生产关键同长远打算结合起来，把零星的局部的改革和全面的根本性的改革结合起来。像制订生产计划一样，制订技术革新和技术革命规划也必须走群众路线，采取“三结合”的办法，发动群众讨论。只有这样，才能充分调动群众的积极性，才能集思广益，把规划制订在既先进又可靠的基础上。
    第九，总结经验。在这次运动中，由于广大群众和全体干部的努力，各方面的经验是极其丰富的。当前的问题就是要求我们认真执行毛主席关于“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来，坚持下去”的指示，及时和有计划地总结运动中的各种经验。只有这样，才能迅速而有效地推广各种先进经验，才能把零散的经验，变成系统的经验，才能按照毛主席所指出的实践——认识——再实践——再认识的规律，把全市技术革新和技术革命运动提高到一个新的水平，才能引导广大群众不断地从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    第十，虚心学习。哈尔滨市在技术革新和技术革命运动中所以能够获得一些成绩，除了首先是由于依靠了党中央和省委的领导，依靠了广大群众和全体干部的努力以外，也是同兄弟地区对我们热情帮助和我们虚心向别人学习分不开的。哈尔滨市推行的很多先进经验，其中有很多是从外地学来的。经验证明，要想树雄心，首先要虚心；要想胜于蓝，必须出于蓝。只有既不自卑，也不自大，虚心学习，克服缺点，养成既生气勃勃、敢想敢干，又兢兢业业、谦虚谨慎的作风，把虚心学习和独创精神结合起来，我们的事业才能不断的前进。
      “四化”、“三遥”、“八路进军”
    哈尔滨市的技术革新和技术革命运动，虽然取得了显著的成绩，并且积累了一些经验，但是在迅速发展进程中，也还存在着许多亟待解决的问题。如在整个运动中，还存在着落后单位和薄弱环节，有些自动化设备还未正常投入生产，工人操作还不够熟练，对于许多先进经验推广得还很不够，企业管理水平还亟待提高等等。认真研究和迅速解决这些问题，已经成为推动运动继续前进的重要关键。为了使技术革新和技术革命运动继续迅速和健康地向前发展，市委不久以前提出了巩固成绩，提高质量，继续发展，阔步前进的方针。根据这个方针，我们号召全体职工：大战一百天，提前实现“千、百、万”（一千条自动化生产线，一百个自动化车间，一万台自动化单机），基本实现手工操作和笨重劳动机械化和半机械化。最近，我们根据运动发展的情况，又提出了“四化”“三遥”“八路进军”的战斗口号，号召广大职工，努力攀登科学技术高峰，大搞“高大精尖新”。所谓“四化”就是机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化。所谓“三遥”，就是要求在实现自动化和半自动化的基础上，不断革命，进一步实现遥控、遥测和遥讯。所谓“八路进军”就是向“四化”进军，向“三遥”进军，向无屑加工进军，向刃具改革进军，向材料综合利用进军，向设计改革进军，向工艺改革进军，向各种管理工具改革进军。这些口号，已经得到全市广大职工群众的热烈响应。可以预料，在不久的将来，哈尔滨市的经济、文化和技术面貌，将会发生更新的变化。哈尔滨市人民，决心要在实现国民经济全面技术改造，支援全省和全国的社会主义建设，为把我国建设成具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国的伟大事业中，做出更多的贡献。
