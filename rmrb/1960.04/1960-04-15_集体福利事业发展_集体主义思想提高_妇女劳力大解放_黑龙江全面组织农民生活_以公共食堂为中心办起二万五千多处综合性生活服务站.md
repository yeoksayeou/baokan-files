(Our Newspaper, Harbin, April 14th) A movement to comprehensively organize the people's economic lives in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, centered on public canteens, has formed a high tide throughout the province.

In order to further adapt to the needs of sustained leaps forward in production and thoroughly liberate the female labor force, the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province have, based on public canteens, established over 25,000 comprehensive living service stations (groups), scattered from communes and management districts to production teams. Together with the original 33,000+ kindergartens and nurseries, 600+ homes for the elderly, and 1,000+ maternity homes, a collective living welfare network is beginning to take shape. The majority of the rural population in Heilongjiang Province have their issues of clothing, food, housing, transportation, daily necessities, birth, marriage, old age, illness, and death handled by these living welfare networks. This has not only further mobilized social labor potential and powerfully promoted the development of production, but has also greatly promoted the new ethos of unity, fraternity, mutual assistance, cooperation, and everyone caring for and loving the collective. The broad masses of rural people throughout the province have never felt so relaxed and single-minded in engaging in production as they do today.

The collective living welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and maternity homes, which have been universally established in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, have been universally consolidated and embarked on a path of sound development after several rounds of rectification and improvement. 95% of the labor force in the rural areas of the province eat in public canteens, and the vast majority of canteens have begun to meet several requirements such as "eating well, eating one's fill, eating economically, eating cleanly and hygienically, self-sufficiency in non-staple food production, mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking utensils, and democratic management." Many canteens have their own vegetable gardens, pig farms, poultry farms, greenhouses, and vegetable cellars, etc., as a base for non-staple food production, and the dietary standards of the masses have generally improved compared to the past. More than 400,000 children are growing up healthily in kindergartens and nurseries. The elderly are joyfully spending their twilight years in homes for the elderly. These welfare organizations have played a huge role in consolidating the people's communes and promoting sustained leaps forward and bumper harvests in production.

With the emergence of the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, the further implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and the great development of diversified operations, more women and semi-laborers were required to break away from tedious housework and participate in production. Many of the commune members who had already participated in production were still concerned about a lot of household chores, which affected production, and needed to be properly arranged and resolved. At the same time, the income of commune members had greatly increased, requiring further improvement in living standards. In this way, comprehensively organizing the people's economic lives became an urgent task. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee promptly absorbed the experience of counties such as Kedong and Zhaodong in organizing the people's economic lives, and proposed that on the basis of consolidating and improving existing various welfare undertakings, under the leadership of the Party committee, with state-owned commerce as the core and public canteens as the base, comprehensive living service stations should be established on a large scale. In just over two months, living service stations (groups) throughout the province sprang up like mushrooms after a rain. There are now more than 25,000 of them, handling urgent household chores for the masses of farmers, such as purchasing, sales, savings, remittances, marriage and funeral matters, inviting doctors, dismantling, washing, sewing, repairing, and even everything including heating the kang. The service methods are flexible and diverse. There are regular services for commune members who frequently need the help of the service station on certain items; there are reservation services where the service station is asked to handle things in advance; and there are temporary services where the service station is asked to handle things temporarily. If all members of a commune member's family are laborers and all household chores need to be handled by the service station, there is a one-stop service that covers everything. In short, many things that commune members had to personally arrange in the past are now handled by the living service station. Most of the service stations are located together with the supply and marketing cooperatives, and the service personnel are in the public canteen. Commune members can simply tell the service personnel what they need while eating. This greatly facilitates the masses, further liberates the female labor force, and allows the masses to engage in production with a single mind, and therefore has been warmly supported by the masses.

Comprehensively organizing the economic lives of farmers, one of the most significant effects is to enable those women who are unable to participate in production due to household chores to join the production front. Before the establishment of living service stations in rural areas throughout the province, more than 1.7 million women were liberated from housework, accounting for 81% of the total female labor force in the province. After the universal establishment of living service stations in various places this time, another large number of women who had been unable to participate in social labor for many years due to household chores were liberated. After the Shengli Management District of the Wuzhan People's Commune in Zhaodong County established a living service station, more than 100 female laborers were added; the labor attendance rate of women in the Shangjia People's Commune increased from 86% in the past to 97%. The living service station has also enabled commune members who have already participated in production to work with even greater concentration. In the past, commune members in the Guangrong Management District of the Wuzhan People's Commune had to spend half a day going back and forth to buy things, but now, if they want to buy anything, they can choose the style they want from the service personnel, and the service personnel will deliver it to their door. Before the establishment of the service station, families where both husband and wife participated in labor had to heat the kang themselves when they returned from work in the evening, which affected their rest and study. Now the service personnel have solved this problem. Single men are even more welcome. They no longer have to worry about everyday chores such as mending, patching, washing, and sewing.

With the comprehensive development of various collective welfare undertakings in the people's communes, the collective ideology of the peasants has been greatly improved, the spirit of unity and mutual assistance has been greatly strengthened, and respecting the old and loving the young, and everyone helping each other in case of trouble, has become a new ethos in rural areas. Liu Shulan, a commune member of the Hexing People's Commune in Zhaodong County, whose husband went to repair a reservoir, was sick at home. The comrades of the service station took the initiative to invite a doctor to her home to see her, and also decocted medicine for her, taking care of her meticulously.

The Party organizations at all levels in Heilongjiang Province believe that the collectivization of life and the socialization of household labor is a great revolution in social life, making lifestyles more compatible with production methods, and is an important measure to consolidate and improve the people's communes, promote production development, and improve the ideological awareness and living standards of the people. In the spirit of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other," they actively organize the people's economic lives. Each Party organization has a secretary personally responsible for leading collective welfare undertakings, and many secretaries personally engage in experimental fields for canteens and various collective welfare work. At the same time, each county and commune has established a life and welfare committee to assist the Party committee in leading this work. Commercial, health, education, civil affairs, women's federations and other relevant departments, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, are united and actively and proactively carrying out welfare undertakings. Leaders at all levels have also sent a large number of Party members, League members, and activists to strengthen the leadership of various welfare work, and have adopted methods such as opening training courses, holding on-site meetings, visits, and having the old lead the new, to train service personnel and improve their level of awareness and professional level, so that they realize that service work is glorious labor and a noble cause, and establish a strong sense of enterprise and responsibility, and continuously improve the quality of service.

    集体福利事业发展　集体主义思想提高　妇女劳力大解放
    黑龙江全面组织农民生活
    以公共食堂为中心办起二万五千多处综合性生活服务站
    本报哈尔滨14日电　黑龙江省农村以公共食堂为中心，全面组织人民经济生活的运动，已在全省形成高潮。
    黑龙江省各地农村为了进一步适应生产持续跃进的需要，彻底
  解放妇女劳动力，以公共食堂为基点，从公社、管理区到生产队，
  星罗棋布地建立起二万五千多处综合性生活服务站（组），加上原有的三万三千多处幼儿园、托儿所和六百多处敬老院、一千多处产院，开始形成了一个集体生活福利事业网。黑龙江省大部分农村人口的衣、食、住、行、用、生、婚、老、病、死等问题，都由这些生活福利事业网承担起来。这不仅进一步发动了社会劳动潜力，有力地促进了生产的发展，而且大大发扬了团结友爱、互助合作，人人关心集体、热爱集体的新风尚。全省广大农村人民从来没有像今天这样心情舒畅，一心无挂搞生产。
    黑龙江省农村普遍建立的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院和产院等集体生活福利事业，经过几次的整顿提高，已经普遍巩固下来，走上了健全发展的道路。全省农村95％的劳动力在公共食堂吃饭，绝大多数食堂已开始达到了“吃得好、吃得饱、吃得省、吃得干净卫生，副食品生产自给和炊具机械化半机械化，管理民主化”等几项要求。许多食堂有了自己的菜园子、养猪场、养禽场、温室和储菜窖等副食品生产家底，群众的饮食水平普遍比过去好。生活在幼儿园和托儿所里的四十多万儿童，健康的成长着。老人们喜笑颜开的在敬老院里欢度晚年。这些福利组织对巩固人民公社，促进生产持续大跃进大丰收，起到了巨大的作用。
    黑龙江省农村随着生产大跃进新形势的出现，农业“八字宪法”的进一步贯彻，多种经营的大发展，要求更多的妇女、半劳力摆脱繁琐的家务劳动参加生产；已经参加生产的社员，还有不少家务琐事牵挂，影响生产，需要妥善安排解决；同时社员的收入大大增加，要求进一步改善生活。这样，全面组织人民经济生活就成为一个迫切的任务。黑龙江省委及时吸取了克东、肇东等县组织人民经济生活的经验，提出在巩固提高已有各种福利事业的基础上，在党委领导下，以国营商业为核心，以公共食堂为基点，大办综合性的生活服务站。在短短的两个来月内，全省的生活服务站（组）就像雨后春笋般的建立起来，现在已达二万五千多处，为农民群众办理迫切需要解决的家务琐事，如代购、代销、储蓄、汇款、婚丧嫁娶事宜，请医生、拆洗缝补、修理，以及包括烧炕等一切家务。服务的方式灵活多样，社员在某几个项目上经常需要服务站帮助解决的有定期服务；有预先约请服务站代为办理的预约服务；临时有事要请服务站代办的临时服务。如果社员全家都是劳动力，家务事统统要服务站代为解决，则有一包到底的一条龙服务。总之，过去要社员亲自张罗的许多事，现在由生活服务站给代办了。服务站大多数都和供销社设在一起，服务员就在公共食堂里，社员有事在吃饭时顺便和服务员说一声就行了。这就大大便利了群众，进一步解放了妇女劳动力，使群众一心无挂的从事生产，因而得到了群众的热烈拥护。
    把农民的经济生活全面组织起来，一个最显著的作用是使那些家务牵挂不能参加生产的妇女，走上了生产战线。全省农村在成立生活服务站以前，就从家务劳动中解放出一百七十多万妇女，占全省妇女劳动力总数的81％。这次各地普遍成立生活服务站之后，又把一大批多少年来因为家务牵挂不能参加社会劳动的妇女解放出来。肇东县五站人民公社胜利管理区建立了生活服务站之后，又增加了一百多名妇女劳动力；尚家人民公社的妇女劳动出勤率，由过去的86％提高到97％。生活服务站还使已经参加生产的社员，更是一心无挂的劳动。五站人民公社光荣管理区的社员过去买东西，来回要耽误半天工，现在要买什么东西，在服务员那里选好样子，服务员就给送上家门。在服务站建立以前，夫妇都参加劳动的家庭，晚上收工回来，还要自己烧炕，影响休息和学习。现在服务员把这个问题给解决了。单身汉更是欢迎，修修补补洗洗缝缝这些日常琐事，现在再也不操心了。
    随着人民公社各种集体福利事业的全面发展，农民的集体主义思想大大提高，团结互助精神大大加强，尊老爱幼，一家有事大家帮助，已成为农村新风尚。肇东县合兴人民公社社员刘淑兰的丈夫修水库去了，她生病在家，服务站的同志就主动的把医生请到她家为她看病，还给熬药，照护无微不至。
    黑龙江省各级党组织，认为生活集体化、家务劳动社会化，是社会生活的伟大革命，使生活方式与生产方式能更加适应，是巩固提高人民公社，促进生产发展，提高人民群众思想觉悟和生活水平的重要措施。他们本着“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的精神，积极组织人民经济生活。各级党组织都有一名书记亲自负责领导集体福利事业，有很多书记亲自搞食堂和各项集体福利工作试验田。同时各县和公社都设立了生活福利委员会，作为党委领导这项工作的助手。商业、卫生、教育、民政、妇联等有关部门，在党委统一领导下，拧成一股绳，积极主动办好福利事业。各级领导还派了大批党团员和积极分子，加强了各项福利工作的领导，并采取开训练班、开现场会、参观、以老带新等办法，培训了服务人员，提高他们的觉悟水平和业务水平，使他们认识到服务工作是光荣的劳动，崇高的事业，树立了坚强的事业心和责任感，不断的提高服务质量。
