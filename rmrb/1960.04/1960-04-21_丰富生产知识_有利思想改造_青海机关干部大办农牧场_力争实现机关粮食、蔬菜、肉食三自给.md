To Enrich Production Knowledge, Beneficial for Ideological Remolding
Qinghai Government Cadres Vigorously Establish Farms and Ranches
Striving to Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Grain, Vegetables, and Meat for Government Offices

    (Reported by our newspaper) A vigorous movement of Qinghai province government cadres vigorously establishing farms and ranches is unfolding. According to incomplete statistics, the number of farms and ranches established by government cadres, factory and mine enterprise workers, school teachers and students, and military officers and soldiers throughout the province has reached more than 150.

    Qinghai has a vast territory and a large amount of fertile wasteland that can be reclaimed in agricultural and pastoral areas. To further implement the policy of simultaneously expanding cultivated land area and increasing unit area yield, with large-scale wasteland reclamation as the main focus, and to achieve high-speed development of agricultural production, Party organizations at all levels in Qinghai province, while mobilizing the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen to continue to reclaim wasteland on a large scale, attach great importance to organizing cadres to participate in wasteland reclamation. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee recently issued a "Decision on Government Cadres Vigorously Establishing Farms and Ranches." Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, pointed out that actively organizing government cadres and family members of cadres with labor ability to participate in wasteland reclamation and vigorously establish government farms is a revolutionary measure of great political and economic significance. It can not only create a large amount of wealth for the country, achieve "two self-sufficiencies" (grain and vegetables) or "three self-sufficiencies" (grain, vegetables, and meat) for government offices, so that the main and supplementary food of government offices, which have always been supplied by the market, do not need or only need a part to be supplied by the market, but also enable government cadres to participate in labor production more frequently, enrich the cadres' practical production knowledge, and thus be more conducive to the ideological remolding of cadres. At the same time, it will also create conditions for gradually eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor, for the vast number of cadres, workers and staff members and their families to get rid of tedious housework, and move towards collectivization, and further encourage the labor enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen in reclaiming wasteland.

    According to the spirit of the instructions of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, the broad masses of government cadres, factory and mine enterprise workers, school teachers and students, and military officers and soldiers in Qinghai province have taken action, organizing wasteland reclamation armies to go to various parts of agricultural and pastoral areas, helping the masses reclaim wasteland on the one hand, and reclaiming wasteland for their own units and establishing farms on the other. Government units at all levels have also generally established government production committees to further strengthen the leadership of this work. Therefore, the work of wasteland reclamation and farm establishment has progressed very rapidly. In just less than ten days from March 6th to 14th, government cadres at the provincial and municipal levels in the Xining area reclaimed more than 30,000 mu of wasteland and established dozens of farms. These farms generally have 400 to 500 mu of land for large ones, and 200 to 300 mu of land for small ones. In addition to planting grain, vegetables and other crops, the vast majority also raise livestock and poultry such as pigs, cattle, and sheep, which is a powerful production base to ensure the realization of "three self-sufficiencies" in grain, vegetables, and meat for government offices.

    The government farms established in Qinghai province, based on the past practical experience of government offices running farms and planting experimental fields, are mostly jointly organized by several government units according to the business system, except for a small number that are run independently by one government office. The advantages of doing so are: more people, strong financial resources, and more conducive to the production and development of diversified operations. In terms of the form of government farms, there are generally two types: one is a farm that utilizes the spare time of cadres and is combined with a short-term professional team composed of cadres and family members with labor ability for production; the other is a farm that focuses on the participation of government cadres in labor and is supplemented by a small number of fixed workers in management. In addition, there are also government farms specially run by cadres who are rotated to lower levels for training.

    At present, the action of government cadres making great efforts in wasteland reclamation and vigorously establishing government farms has greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the masses in reclaiming wasteland. A mass spring rush to reclaim wasteland has been formed throughout the province.

    丰富生产知识　有利思想改造
    青海机关干部大办农牧场
    力争实现机关粮食、蔬菜、肉食三自给
    本报讯　青海省机关干部大办农牧场的运动，正在蓬勃地展开。据不完全统计，目前全省机关干部、厂矿企业职工、学校师生、部队官兵等办起的农牧场已达一百五十多个。
    青海地区辽阔，在农牧业区有着大量可垦的肥沃荒地。为了进一步贯彻执行以大量开垦荒地为主、扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量并举的方针，实现农业生产的高速度发展，青海省各级党组织在动员广大农牧民群众继续大量开垦荒地的同时，十分重视组织干部参加垦荒工作。中共青海省委在最近作出了“关于机关干部大办农牧场的决定”。中共青海省委第一书记高峰指出积极组织机关干部和有劳动能力的干部家属参加垦荒，大办机关农场，是一个具有重大政治意义和经济意义的革命措施，不仅可以为国家创造大量财富，实现机关粮食、蔬菜“两自给”或粮食、蔬菜、肉食“三自给”，使一直由市场供应的机关主副食品，不需要或只要一部分由市场供应，而且可以使机关干部更加经常地参加劳动生产，丰富干部的生产实践知识，从而也就更有利于干部的思想改造。同时，也将为逐渐消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，为广大干部职工家属摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，走向集体化创造条件，并进一步鼓舞农牧民群众进行垦荒的劳动热情。
    根据中共青海省委指示的精神，青海省广大机关干部、厂矿企业职工、学校师生、部队官兵都已行动起来，纷纷组织垦荒大军分赴农牧业区各地，一面帮助群众垦荒，一面为本单位开垦荒地，建立农场。各机关单位并普遍成立了机关生产委员会，进一步加强对这一工作的领导。因而垦荒建场工作进展非常迅速。仅3月6日到14日不到十天的时间，西宁地区省、市级机关干部就开垦荒地三万多亩，建立了几十个农场。这些农场，大的一般有土地四、五百亩，小的一般有土地二、三百亩，除种植粮食、蔬菜等各种农作物外，绝大多数并养有猪、牛、羊等家畜家禽，是保证实现机关粮食、蔬菜、肉食“三自给”的一个强大生产基地。
    青海省兴办的机关农场，根据以往机关办农场和种试验田的实践经验，除少部分为一个机关单独举办的以外，绝大多数都是按照业务系统由好几个机关单位联合举办的。这样做的好处是：人多、资金雄厚，更有利于生产的进行和发展多种经营。在机关农场的形式上，一般有两种：一种是利用干部业余时间结合由干部和有劳动能力的家属组成的短期专业队进行生产的农场；一种是以机关干部参加劳动为主、以少量固定工人参加管理为辅的农场。另外，也有专门由轮流下放锻炼干部举办的机关农场。
    目前，机关干部大闹垦荒、大办机关农场的行动已大大地鼓舞了群众垦荒的劳动热情。一个群众性春季突击垦荒高潮已在全省形成。
