    Building the Motherland, Defending the Motherland
    – Watching the Color Documentary "The Whole Nation is a Soldier"
    General Zhang Aiping

    In the autumn of 1958, when the people of our country, under the leadership of the Party, were carrying out socialist construction with great enthusiasm and at a Great Leap Forward speed, American imperialism launched new military provocations against us in the Taiwan Strait, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched in Taiwan to shell our Fujian Xiamen and the coastal areas, harming peaceful working people. The heinous acts of American imperialism aroused boundless indignation among the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao issued the great call to establish militia divisions in a big way, which received enthusiastic response from the people of the whole country and set off a high tide of establishing militia divisions.

    The "The Whole Nation is a Soldier" color documentary, produced by the August First Film Studio of the People's Liberation Army, vividly demonstrates the magnificent spirit of the whole nation as soldiers, and that the militia is a shock force in socialist construction; it vividly displays the great thought of Chairman Mao's people's war. This is an excellent film that is both politically and artistically successful.

    At the beginning of the film, with the majestic and sonorous singing, the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland are displayed before our eyes, from the Fujian front to the Kangzang Plateau, from Changbai Mountain to Hainan Island, moving pictures inspire our heroic feelings and make us feel that the land is so beautiful! Look, in the beautiful and rich fields and towns of our great motherland, socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds day by day, and the face of the motherland is changing rapidly, just as the lyrics of the film express: "Yesterday's barren mountains and wild ridges are now full of cattle and sheep; yesterday's desert plains are now forests of factories." Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our industrious and brave people, holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, are creating amazing miracles on all fronts of socialist construction with selfless labor and infinite wisdom, and are rapidly building the motherland into a prosperous and strong modern power. We love our happy life and we also love peace, but we know that as long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for war. Therefore, we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, building the motherland on the one hand and defending the motherland on the other.

    With the leap forward development of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement in the motherland, the socialist consciousness of the people of the whole country has been unprecedentedly improved, and they have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "establish militia divisions in a big way," and the people have come together to participate in the militia. As seen in the film: from mines to factories, from cities to the countryside, from government offices to schools, people of all ethnic groups, whether young or old, male or female, are taking up arms in their hands with unparalleled enthusiasm, preparing to defend the motherland. Zhang Lu, an old worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, said: "If you only want young workers and not old workers, I have an opinion, I, an old man, must also learn the skills to eliminate the enemy!" The movement of the whole nation as soldiers is developing vigorously throughout the country.

    Chairman Mao's thought on people's war was the great strategic thought of our Party and the people of our country in the past to defeat enemies at home and abroad and win the complete victory of the people's revolutionary war; and in the present and future, it is still the great strategic thought for defending the motherland and completely defeating imperialist aggression. The militia is an important foundation of the people's war, and is a powerful assistant and strong reserve force for the main force and local troops of the People's Liberation Army. The militia not only made great contributions in the past revolutionary wars, but also plays a huge role in the struggle to defend the motherland's sea, land and air frontiers. In the film we can see: In the 1958 artillery battle to punish the Kinmen Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, the heroic spirit of the militia on the Fujian front, they actively supported and cooperated with the main force in combat, including the young militiamen Wu Yongyuan and Wu Jingchao who bravely connected telephone lines under intense artillery fire, and the young militiaman Cai Bairen who used his body to protect the wounded; the heroic "ten sisters" who transported shells, rescued the wounded, cooked, delivered tea, and did laundry day and night; and the maritime militia transportation team that bravely and cleverly broke through the enemy's artillery fire blockade. These vivid scenes and heroic figures not only make people unforgettable for a long time, but also allow us to vividly see the power of the masses and the brilliance of the thought of people's war. At the same time, it embodies the indisputable truth of Chairman Mao's saying that "the people are the source of victory."

    The militia is both civilians and soldiers. It first completes tasks such as production, work, and study. At the same time, it prepares to complete the glorious task of defending the motherland once imperialism launches a war of aggression. The militia of our country has a fine tradition of combining labor and military affairs. In the past war years, they held a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other; while actively producing, they bravely fought against the enemy; and today they still maintain the glorious tradition of combining labor and military affairs. As seen in the film, explosion heroes Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu, and Wild Goose Brigade member Zhao Po, from the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the Liberation War, are working and conducting military training selflessly with young militiamen; male and female militiamen in Jingyanggang are engaged in fierce competition during harvesting; the militiamen building the Miyun Reservoir demonstrate the huge shock role of the militia in labor in the form of large-scale corps operations; and the militiamen of the people's commune on the Fujian front continue to persist in production under enemy artillery fire. The militia also conducts military, political, cultural, and sports training during production gaps and slack seasons to improve military technology and political awareness. We saw the advanced figures such as sharpshooter Liu Yanfeng, and artillery couple Liu Guozhen and Hu Haichong participating in shooting competitions; old militia heroes from the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the Liberation War setting up landmine formations and conducting water guerrilla warfare exercises; tractor drivers driving tanks on complex terrain, and so on. Their image embodies that the militia division is a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization.

    With the development of socialist construction in the motherland, the militia of our country has undergone new development and improvement in both quantity and quality, and has become an important part of modern national defense forces. Now, American imperialism is playing the trick of fake peace and real war preparations, actively developing missiles, supporting Japanese and West German militarism, and still occupying our territory Taiwan, establishing military bases around our country, constantly violating our territorial waters and airspace, and conducting military provocations, seriously threatening the security of the motherland and peace in the Far East and the world. Although we love peace and oppose war, we are not afraid of war. If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, we will surely bury the invaders in the vast ocean of the whole nation as soldiers. (Attached pictures)

    建设祖国，保卫祖国
    ——观彩色纪录影片“全民皆兵”
    上将　张爱萍
    1958年秋，我国人民正在党的领导下，以大跃进的速度，轰轰烈烈地进行社会主义建设的时候，美帝国主义在台湾海峡对我进行新的军事挑衅，支持盘踞台湾的蒋匪军自金门炮击我福建厦门及沿海一带的和平劳动人民。美帝国主义的罪恶行为激起了全国人民无比的愤怒。毛主席发出大办民兵师的伟大号召，得到了全国人民的热烈响应，掀起了大办民兵师的热潮。
    人民解放军八一电影制片厂摄制的“全民皆兵”彩色纪录片，就生动地展现出全民皆兵的雄伟气概，和民兵是社会主义建设的突击力量；它形象地显示出毛主席人民战争的伟大思想。这是一部在政治上和艺术上都很成功的优秀影片。
    影片一开始，随着雄壮嘹亮的歌声，祖国的锦绣河山展现在我们眼前，从福建前线到康藏高原，从长白山到海南岛，一幅幅动人的画面，激发着我们豪迈的心情，感到江山如此多娇！看吧，在我们伟大祖国美丽富饶的田野和城镇，社会主义建设正一日千里地突飞猛进，祖国的面貌正日新月异地飞跃变化，正如影片歌词所表述的那样：“昨天的荒山野岭，今天已牛羊成群；昨天的沙漠平地，今天已工厂成林。”我国勤劳勇敢的人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，以忘我的劳动和无穷的智慧，在社会主义建设的各个战线上，创造着惊人的奇迹，把祖国迅速建设成为繁荣富强的现代强国。我们热爱自己的幸福生活，也热爱和平，但是我们深知只要帝国主义存在，就有发生战争的土壤。所以我们必须随时保持着高度的警惕，一面建设祖国，一面保卫祖国。
    随着祖国的大跃进和人民公社运动的飞跃发展，全国人民的社会主义觉悟空前提高，纷纷响应毛主席“大办民兵师”的伟大号召，万众齐来参加民兵。影片中可以看到：从矿山到工厂，从城市到农村，从机关到学校，各族人民无论青年、老年，男男女女，都以无比的热情人人手中拿起武器，准备保卫祖国。石景山发电厂老工人张禄说：“只要青年工人，不要老工人，我有意见，我老头子也要学会消灭敌人的本领！”全民皆兵的运动，在全国各地蓬勃发展着。
    毛主席的人民战争思想，在过去，是我们党和我国人民战胜国内外敌人、取得人民革命战争的彻底胜利的伟大战略思想；在现在和将来，仍然是保卫祖国，彻底打败帝国主义侵略的伟大战略思想。而民兵是人民战争的重要基础，是人民解放军主力部队、地方部队的有力助手和强大的后备力量。民兵不仅在过去的革命战争中作出了伟大的贡献，而且在保卫祖国海陆边防和空防的斗争中仍然起着巨大的作用。在影片中我们可以看到：在1958年惩罚金门蒋匪军的炮战中，福建前线民兵的英雄气概，他（她）们积极支援和配合主力军作战，有在猛烈的炮火下，奋不顾身接通电话线的青年民兵吴永远、吴景超，和用身体掩护伤员的青年民兵蔡白忍；有夜以继日地搬运炮弹、抢救伤员和为战士做饭、送茶、洗衣的英雄“十姐妹”；还有勇敢、机智地冲过敌人炮火封锁的海上民兵运输队。这些生动的场面和英雄人物，不仅使人久久不能忘怀，更使我们形象地看到人民群众的力量和人民战争思想的光辉。同时体现出毛主席“兵民是胜利之本”的颠扑不破的真理。
    民兵，是民又是兵，它首先完成生产、工作、学习等任务，同时，准备一旦帝国主义发动侵略战争时，完成保卫祖国的光荣任务。我国的民兵，有着劳武结合的优良传统，在过去战争年代，一手拿锄头，一手拿枪；一面积极生产，一面英勇对敌作战；而今天仍然保持着劳武结合的光荣传统。从影片中看到，抗日战争和解放战争中的爆炸英雄于化虎、赵守福和雁翎队队员赵坡，和青年民兵在一起，进行着忘我的劳动和军事训练；景阳岗男女民兵在收割中展开热烈竞赛；修建密云水库的民兵，以大兵团作战的形式，显示出民兵在劳动中的巨大突击作用；福建前线人民公社的民兵，在敌人炮火下仍然坚持生产。民兵还在生产间隙和农闲季节进行军事、政治、文化和体育训练，以提高军事技术和政治水平。我们看到了女神枪手刘延风，夫妻炮手刘国真、胡海崇等先进人物参加射击竞赛；抗日战争和解放战争中的老民兵英雄在摆地雷阵和进行水上游击战演习；拖拉机手在复杂地形上驾驶坦克，等等。他们的形象，体现了民兵师是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。
    随着祖国社会主义建设的发展，我国民兵无论在数量和质量上都有了新的发展和提高，已经成为现代国防力量的重要组成部分。现在，美帝国主义正玩弄假和平真备战的手法，积极发展导弹，扶植日本、西德军国主义，并且仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，在我国周围建立军事基地，不断侵犯我国的领海、领空，进行军事挑衅，严重地威胁着祖国的安全和远东与世界和平。我们虽然热爱和平，反对战争，但也不害怕战争。如果美帝国主义胆敢发动对我国的侵略战争，我们就一定把侵略者埋葬在全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。（附图片）
