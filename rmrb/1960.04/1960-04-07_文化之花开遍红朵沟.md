Party Secretary's Notes

    Cultural Flowers Bloom Throughout Hongduo Ravine
    Li Peixian, First Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiutai County Committee
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Hongduo Ravine Management Area of Shanghewan Commune in Jiutai County has set high aspirations and ambitions, launching a vigorous cultural revolution. Over the past ten years, along with the development of production, farmers' spare-time education has also achieved brilliant success. When praising the victory of their cultural revolution and their happy life, the commune members say:
    Barren land turns into fertile fields,
    Poor mountains turn into rich plains;
    Culture has turned over,
    We have enough to eat and wear;
    From being crude and uncultured,
    Now we compose poems;
    Thanks to the Party's leadership,
    We climb higher step by step.
    Hongduo Ravine is located in the northeast of Jiutai County, within the Shanghewan People's Commune, 180 li (about 90 kilometers) from the county seat. Surrounded by mountains and dense forests, with firewood all over the hills, more than 300 households live in this rich mountain village. However, in the old society, among the entire village population of over 1,200, those who had studied for three or two years were considered "saints." Only seven or eight people were slightly educated. At that time, a folk song was circulating among the masses:
    Hongduo is a blind village, with only a few literate people,
    When relatives and friends send letters, we have to seek help from people several miles away.
    After liberation, the masses, having been liberated politically and economically, had an increasingly urgent need for cultural liberation. Just then, the Party organization issued a call to learn culture, so they started private schools and launched a literacy campaign.
    People who couldn't recognize a single character in the past can now write poetry, paint, read books and newspapers. When Fu Jinglong was a child, he was deprived of the right to learn culture by the old society. Now, not only does the gallery newspaper and the walls of Hongduo Ravine feature his artwork, but he is also often invited by the Shanghewan People's Commune to engage in creative work. People call him "our own painter." A thriving atmosphere of cultural revolution envelops the happy mountain village. Look! On the colored archway is written "Stand up and fight against nature, sit down and march towards culture," what a magnificent and moving battle slogan! Look! The gallery newspaper is plastered with commune members' own creations of cartoons, poems, folk rhymes, etc., all praising the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the People's Commune, and the Great Leap Forward. From the beginning of the establishment of the Hongduo Ravine private school, the then village head and Communist Party member, Ma Hongyou, in coordination with the private school teacher Liang Wansheng, first set up the first private school. Seeing that many people had learned culture in the private school, the masses rushed to enroll. Dong Yuqi, Dong Yulian and others, who originally thought "too old, clumsy and unable to learn" and did not enroll, also actively signed up despite their homes being far from the school, trekking over mountains and ridges to seek knowledge. More and more students, and the private schools are getting better and better. With the birth of the first private school, other local private schools were also established one after another. The students' enthusiasm for learning is also getting higher and higher, truly: "Rain or shine, it can't be stopped." After several years of hard work, batches of young men and women have been removed from illiteracy, and one after another spare-time primary classes, higher primary classes, and middle school classes have been established. At that time, the students wrote a jingle to express their attitude, saying: "Socialist industrialization, agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, electrification, farmers becoming workers, no matter what ‘-ization’ it is, it cannot be separated from culture. For the modernization of our country, we are determined to continue learning culture."
    Solving the contradiction between production and learning time is the central link in consolidating private schools. At the beginning of the school, classes were only held in winter and spring. Once the summer and autumn farming seasons came, the school was dismissed. The farmers were dissatisfied with not being able to persist in year-round learning, saying: "Winter school every year, learning from scratch every year." With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the village lacked work recorders and bookkeepers, and there was an urgent need for people with culture. According to the new situation of rural development, the Party branch decided to turn winter school into a year-round private school to accelerate the improvement of farmers' cultural level, and put forward the slogan "Learn where production goes, learn where work goes," adopting the method of studying intensively during small busy periods and studying separately during big busy periods, organizing the masses to persist in year-round learning, breaking the routine of production being busy and learning stopping. They divided the whole year's study into several stages. In winter and summer, they used two hours in the evening for intensive study; during spring planting, they used one hour for intensive study; during the busy summer and autumn seasons, they adopted methods such as concentrated classes, decentralized tutoring, regular study on weekdays, full-day study on rainy days, and turning fields into classrooms, turning concentration into dispersion, changing two hours to one hour, teachers and students going to the fields, textbooks and blackboards going to the fields, and cultural entertainment going to the fields. This learning method is very popular among commune members.
    From the very beginning, the Hongduo Ravine private school has adhered to the principle of relying on the masses, self-reliance, and running schools diligently and thriftily. At the beginning of running the private school, there were no houses, so the students brought their own small oil lamps and took turns going to each other's homes to study every evening. Later, Party member Ma Hongyou and private school teacher Liang Wansheng squeezed their own houses and vacated rooms for everyone to attend winter school. As time went by, the number of students increased, and it was impossible to squeeze any more on the kang (heated brick bed) and on the ground. The Party organization discovered this problem and led the students to discuss and study solutions. Everyone unanimously proposed: With more people, there is more strength, relying on everyone to repair the school building, if there is no material, everyone will collect it, if there is no firewood, go up the mountain to chop it. The teachers and students responded to the call of the branch, contributed their own strength, offered suggestions, and went up the mountain to chop firewood. With the assistance of the broad masses, two spacious private schools were built on the flat ground in a few days, and stoves were installed at the same time, using the firewood they had chopped to solve the problem of winter heating. Later, teachers and students often used the method of going up the mountain to chop firewood to solve the difficulties of school desks, chairs, benches, lamp oil, paper, and pens, and also bought more than a thousand books to establish a library.
    In solving the problem of consolidating the results of literacy, they created the method of "seeing things to recognize words," and in recent years, "seeing things to recognize words" signs have been hung everywhere in the village head, street corners, walls, trees, various tools, and even on cattle horns and tails. This method has been warmly welcomed by the commune members, who call it "unmanned teacher"; they also launched a literacy campaign of "writing a thousand characters" and "reading a hundred articles" among the students. This not only consolidated the results of literacy, but also exercised writing skills and increased revolutionary knowledge.
    "Of all the things, the Party's leadership is the first." This is a truth that has been once again proven by the victory of the farmers' cultural revolution movement in Hongduo Ravine over the past ten years. In order to strengthen the leadership of the cultural revolution, the Party branch of the Hongduo Ravine Management Area has put the work of farmers' spare-time education on the Party committee's important agenda. The secretary and director of the management area, and the captains of the production teams are all good students of the private school. Among the seven cadres in the management area, six are students of spare-time middle schools. Zhang Ligong, the secretary of the Party branch, was originally illiterate, and Li Wenzhi, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, was originally a cowherd girl from a poor family, and now they both have a junior high school education. They can not only take minutes in meetings, but also write summary reports.
    In the work of farmers' spare-time education, the Hongduo Ravine Management Area has greatly improved the political consciousness of the commune members, broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and cultivated cadres and technical talents by adhering to the combination of politics, culture, and technology, which has promoted the development of production. Over the past ten years, among the students who have become literate, eleven cadres at the level of secretary and director of the management area, nineteen production team leaders, eighteen bookkeepers, four administrators, and four private school teachers have been trained and selected. These people have become all-round cadres who can write, calculate, and are both literary and martial. Luan Fengyang, who did not know a single character in the past, is now the director of the management area who can write and calculate.
    Now, the management area has a library and each production team has a mobile library station. In the library and library stations, there are more than 4,000 books, and the commune members can read their favorite books anytime and anywhere. The management area has also established a club that can accommodate more than 100 people, and a spare-time drama troupe composed of more than 20 literate students, which often cooperates with the Party's central work to give consolation performances to the commune members. With the development of rural cultural and educational undertakings and the improvement of life, every household has installed radio loudspeakers, and the commune members can hear melodious music and major events at home and abroad. The management area has also established a health center, so that commune members can receive timely treatment from doctors without leaving the village, and has also changed the sanitary conditions in the mountainous areas. Everywhere presents a thriving scene.
    Hongduo Ravine, which used to be very desolate, has now finally become a happy cultural mountain village with abundant food and clothing. But they are not satisfied, and in the spirit of continuous revolution, they have now formulated a magnificent plan to have all young people in the management area reach the level of university education in about ten years.

    文化之花开遍红朵沟
    中共吉林九台县委第一书记　李沛贤
    九台县上河湾公社红朵沟管理区，在党的领导下，立雄心、树大志，大闹文化革命。十多年来，随着生产的发展，农民业余教育也取得了辉煌的成就。社员们夸赞他们文化革命的胜利和幸福生活时说：
    薄地变良田，
    穷山变富原；
    文化翻了身，
    有吃又有穿；
    从前大老粗，
    如今作诗篇；
    多亏党领导，
    步步登高山。
    红朵沟位于九台县东北部、距县城一百八十华里的上河湾人民公社境内。周围群山环绕、丛林密布，柴草满山，三百来户人家生活在这富饶的山村。可是在旧社会全村一千二百多人口，念过三年两年书的就是这里的“圣人”。稍有文化的只有七、八个人。当时在群众中流传着这样一首歌谣：
    红朵是盲村，仅有几个识字人，
    亲朋故友来封信，数里之外去求人。
    解放后，群众在政治上经济上翻了身之后，文化翻身的要求也就越来越迫切了。正在这时，党组织发出了学习文化的号召，他们就办起了民校，开展了识字运动。
    过去一个字也不识的人，如今也能写诗作画，看书读报。傅景龙童年的时候，被旧社会剥夺了学习文化的权利，现在不仅红朵沟的画廊报、墙头上有他的美术作品，而且还常被上河湾人民公社请去搞创作。人们称他是“自己的画家”。文化革命欣欣向荣的气氛笼罩着幸福的山村。你看！彩门上写着“站起来向自然搏斗，坐下来向文化进军”，这是多么雄壮而动人的战斗口号。你看！画廊报上贴满了社员自己创作的漫画、诗歌、快板等作品，都在歌颂共产党、毛主席，歌颂人民公社和大跃进。红朵沟民校建校开始，当时的村长、共产党员马洪友，协同民校教师梁万生，首先办起了第一所民校。群众看到有不少人在民校学到了文化，都争先报名入学。原来认为“年纪大，笨手笨脚学不了”而没有入学的董玉琪、董玉连等人，虽然家离校较远，也积极报名，翻山越岭来求学。学生越来越多，民校越办越好。随着第一所民校的诞生，本地其它的民校也一所跟一所建立起来了。学员们的学习热情也越来越高涨，真是：“风雨无阻，雷打不散”。经过几年的努力，一批又一批的男女青壮年被摘掉了文盲帽子，一处又一处的业余初小班、高小班、中学班跟着建立起来了。当时学员们曾写了一篇顺口溜表示自己的态度说：“社会主义工业化，农业机械化、水利化、电气化，农民工人化，不论是啥化，离不开文化，为了我国现代化，决心继续学文化”。
    解决生产和学习时间上的矛盾，是巩固民校的中心环节。开始办校只是冬春两季开课，一到夏秋农忙季节，学校就散了。农民对不能坚持常年学习感到不满足地说：“年年上冬学，年年从头学”。随着互助合作运动的发展，村里缺少记工员、记账员，迫切需要有文化的人。党支部根据农村发展的新形势，决定把冬学办成常年民校，加速提高农民文化水平，并提出“生产到那里学习到那里，工作到那里学习到那里”的口号，采取小忙集中学，大忙分散学的方法，组织群众坚持常年学习，打破了生产忙、学习停的常规。他们把全年学习划分为几个阶段，冬夏两季利用晚间两小时集中学习；春播时间利用一小时集中学习；夏秋大忙季节，他们就采用集中上课，分散辅导，平日按时学，雨天整日学和变田间为课堂，变集中为分散，变两小时为一小时，师生到田间，课本黑板到田间，文化娱乐到田间等办法。这种学习方法深受社员欢迎。
    红朵沟民校从第一所开始，就坚持了依靠群众，自力更生，勤俭办学的方针。开始办民校没有房子，学员们就自己带着小油灯，每天晚间轮流到各家去学习。后来党员马洪友和民校教师梁万生就把自己住的屋子挤了挤，腾出房子让大家上冬学。天长日久入学人数增加了，炕上地下挤也挤不开了。党组织发现这个问题，就领导学员进行讨论，研究解决的办法。大家一致提出：人多力量大，依靠大家修校舍，没有材料大家凑，没有烧柴上山打。师生们响应了支部的号召，贡献了自己的力量，献方献计，上山打柴。在广大群众的协助下，几天的工夫平地上盖起了两所宽敞的民校，同时安装了火炉，用自己打的柴火解决了冬季取暖的问题。以后，师生们就常常用上山打柴的办法，解决了学校桌、椅、板凳、灯油、纸笔等困难，并且还买了一千多册图书，建立了一座图书馆。
    在解决巩固扫盲成果这个问题中，他们创造了“见物识字牌”的办法，几年来，这里的村头、街口、墙上、树上、各种工具上，甚至牛角、牛尾巴上都挂着“见物识字牌”。这个办法已受到了社员们的热烈欢迎，都称它为“无人老师”；他们还在学员中开展了“写千字”、“读百篇”的识字运动。这样不但巩固了扫盲成果，还锻炼了写字能力，增加了革命知识。
    “千条万条党的领导是第一条”。这是被红朵沟十多年来农民文化革命运动的胜利再一次证明的真理。红朵沟管理区党支部为了加强对文化革命的领导，把农民业余教育工作放到了党委的重要议事日程。管理区的书记和主任，生产队的队长都是民校的好学生。管理区七个干部，有六个是业余中学的学生。党支部书记张立功，原来不识字，团支部书记李文芝原来就是贫苦家庭出身的放牛姑娘，现在他们都有初中文化程度。他们不但开会能记录，而且还能写总结报告。
    红朵沟管理区在农民业余教育工作上，由于坚持政治、文化、技术三结合，大大地提高了社员政治觉悟，破除了迷信，解放了思想，培养了干部和技术人材，促进了生产的发展。十年来在脱盲的学员中，培养选拔了管理区书记、主任一级干部十一名，生产队长十九名，记账员十八名，管理员四名，民校教师四名。这些人已经成为能写会算、能文能武的全能干部了。过去一个字也不识的栾凤阳，已经是一个能写会算的管理区主任了。
    现在这个管理区建有图书馆一处，各生产队分别设有流动图书站。在图书馆和图书站里，备有四千多册图书，社员们随时随地都可以看到自己心爱的读物。管理区还建立了一所容纳一百多人的俱乐部，脱盲学员二十多人组成的业余剧团，经常配合党的中心工作，给社员作慰问演出。随着农村文教事业发展和生活的改善，家家安上了广播喇叭，社员们坐在家里就可以听到悦耳的音乐和国内外大事。管理区还建立了卫生所，社员们有病不用出屯，即可得到医生及时的治疗，并且也改变了山区的卫生条件。到处呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    过去十分荒凉的红朵沟，现在终于变成了丰衣足食的幸福的文化山村。可是他们并不满足，本着不断革命的精神，现在他们已经制定了一个再有十年左右时间，全管理区青壮年全部达到大学程度的雄伟规划。
