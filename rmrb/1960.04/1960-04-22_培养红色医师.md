　　Cultivate Red Doctors
　　The senior students of Zhejiang Medical College went out of the school and established two workers' hospitals for factories. Through medical activities, they supported production and improved the quality of teaching, which can be described as killing two birds with one stone.
　　The practice of Zhejiang Medical College once again proves the correctness of the Party's medical education policy. The fundamental difference between our medical education and that of the bourgeoisie lies in the close integration of this education with practice, which must serve class struggle and production activities, and cultivate red doctors who have both medical theory and practical skills.
　　The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 brought about a new situation of great revolution in China's medical education. Medical education was closely integrated with productive labor, mass health campaigns, and traditional Chinese medicine. A large number of new-type doctors who are both red and expert emerged, greatly changing China's medical education. The practice of Zhejiang Medical College is a bright flower in the great revolution of medical education. Although this school has only been running hospitals in factories for more than a year, because the students have learned "real skills" and have been exposed to the reality of production, they have generally improved their ability to diagnose during their internships and have realized the relationship between medical work and national construction.
　　At present, China's industrial and agricultural production has seen a greater leap forward, and the health movement is also flourishing, which puts forward many new topics for medical educators. We must further implement the Party's medical education policy, face production, combine with practice, and cultivate more new-type doctors who are both red and expert for the motherland.

    培养红色医师
    浙江医学院高年级的学生，走出学校大门，为工厂创办了两个工人医院。通过医疗活动，他们支援了生产，又提高了教学质量，可称得起一举两得。
    浙江医学院的作法，再次证明了党的医学教育方针的正确性。我们的医学教育和资产阶级根本不同的地方，在于这种教育和实际密切结合，必须服务于阶级斗争和生产活动，培养既有医学理论，又有实际本领的红色医生。
    1958和1959两年的大跃进，使我国医学教育出现了大革命的新局面。医学教育和生产劳动、群众卫生运动以及祖国医学密切结合，新型的又红又专的医师大量涌现，使我国医学教育大为改观。浙江医学院的作法，就是医学教育大革命中的一支鲜艳花朵。这个学校在工厂办医院虽只有一年多的时间，但由于学生学到的是“真刀真枪”的本事，接触到的是生产实际，因此普遍提高了实习诊断能力，并认识到医疗工作和祖国建设的关系。
    目前，我国工农业生产出现了更大跃进形势，卫生运动也在蓬勃开展，这就给医学教育工作者提出了许多新的课题。我们必须进一步贯彻党的医学教育方针，面向生产，结合实际，为祖国培养出更多的又红又专的新型医师。
