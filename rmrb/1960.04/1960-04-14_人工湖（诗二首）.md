Artificial Lake
(Two Poems)		Chen Guoping
	The lake water is as clear as a mirror, the spring breeze stirs the green duckweed,
	Birds dot the white clouds, fallen leaves scatter fish shadows.
	East of the lake ripples with golden waves, west of the lake rolls with green clouds,
	Commune members pass with hoes, the whole lake is filled with laughter.
	The power station stands on the shore of the lake, light smoke brushes against the flowing clouds,
	The sound of motors rings in the ear, azaleas bloom on the lake shore.
	The spring night scenery is beautiful, electric light illuminates the green shade,
	Commune members row flat boats, scooping for stars at the bottom of the lake.
	Casting fishing nets from the bow, releasing cormorants from the stern,
	Fish jump in the cabin, singing never stops on the boat:
	"The North transforms with water conservancy, everywhere is a Jiangnan spring,
	The commune has a good year, and the five grains are all abundant."
		Fetching Water Ballad
	In the past, we fetched water down South Mountain,
	A carrying pole bent on both ends,
	Sweating and exhausted,
	One slip and the back would break.
	The commune installed an electric well,
	A crank turning smoothly,
	Well water that will never run out,
	A happy life like a spring of water.

    人工湖
    （诗二首）	    陈国屏
    湖水明如镜，春风动绿萍，
    鸟点白云乱，落叶散鱼影。
    湖南泛金涛，湖西卷绿云，
    社员荷锄过，满湖欢笑声。
    电站立湖岸，轻烟拂流云，
    耳边马达响，湖畔杜鹃鸣。
    春夜景色好，电光照绿荫，
    社员荡扁舟，湖底捞星星。
    船头撒鱼网，船尾放鱼鹰，
    舱内鱼儿跳，船上歌不停：
    “塞北水利化，处处江南春，
    公社好年景，五谷齐丰登。”
      挑水谣
    往年挑水下南山，
    一根扁担两头弯，
    累得满脸汗珠滚，
    两脚一滑腰折断。
    公社装上电力井，
    一摇辘轳溜溜转，
    井水永远打不完，
    幸福生活像井泉。
