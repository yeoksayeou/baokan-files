Xinhua News Agency, April 7th, Accra News: The emergency meeting of African countries and parties to discuss the issue of safeguarding peace and security in Africa opened today in Accra, the capital of Ghana.

Participating in the meeting are approximately three hundred representatives and observers from all over the African continent. These include representatives from nine independent African countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Morocco, Tunisia, the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Ethiopia, Libya, and Liberia, as well as representatives from many African parties and organizations.

Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah delivered a speech at the opening meeting. He said that as long as one inch of African soil remains under colonial rule, the African continent will be in discord and conflict.

Nkrumah said that the beginning of 1960 saw the culmination of cruel atrocities inflicted upon the peace-loving people of the African continent. In this regard, he pointed to France's atomic explosions in the Sahara and the recent massacre of African people by the government of the Union of South Africa. However, he said, this will "mark the beginning of the end of foreign hegemony and rule in Africa."

Nkrumah said that all independent African countries must take joint and active action to deal with these matters. At the same time, he advocated that such action should be inspired by the spirit of Gandhi and the principles of non-violence. He suggested organizing marches from all parts of the African continent to the French atomic testing grounds to hold peaceful protests.

The meeting will establish three committees: The first committee will discuss the issue of active action against French nuclear explosions and South African apartheid policies; the second committee will study the specific actions that independent African countries can take on the issues of atomic bomb testing, Algeria, and South Africa; the third committee will discuss the issue of imperialism's attempts to divide Africa, to "Balkanize" Africa, and what methods of struggle to adopt to oppose the last-ditch efforts of colonialist countries to maintain their position in Africa.

Xinhua News Agency, April 6th: The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee today sent a telegram to the emergency meeting of African countries and parties to be held in Accra, Ghana, saying that the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee expresses its warm support for the African people's struggle for national independence and against France's nuclear weapons testing in the Sahara.

The meeting, scheduled for April 7th to 9th, will discuss what actions to take in the future to prevent Africa from being used again as a nuclear weapons testing ground, to make the African people vigilant against new forms of colonialism, and to be vigilant against the colonialists' conspiracies to split Africa and undermine African unity. Representatives from more than twenty African countries have indicated that they will participate in the meeting.

The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee expressed warm congratulations to the meeting in the telegram. The telegram said: "The surging torrent of the African people's national independence movement cannot be stopped by any colonialist force.

"We wish the meeting new contributions to the just cause of uniting the African people against imperialism and colonialism, striving for national independence, opposing racial discrimination, and safeguarding world peace, and we wish the meeting success."

    反对殖民主义者分裂非洲团结的阴谋
    非洲国家及政党紧急会议开幕
    我亚非团结委员会致电祝贺会议成功
    新华社7日讯　阿克拉消息：讨论关于保卫非洲和平和安全问题的非洲国家及政党紧急会议今天在加纳首都阿克拉开幕。
    参加这次会议的有来自非洲大陆各地的约三百名代表和观察员。其中包括加纳、几内亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯、阿联、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、利比亚和利比里亚等九个非洲独立国家及许多非洲政党和组织的代表。
    加纳总理恩克鲁玛在开幕会议上发表演说。他说，只要非洲有一寸土地还在殖民统治之下，非洲大陆将处在不和和冲突之中。
    恩克鲁玛说，1960年的开头就出现了对非洲大陆爱好和平人民施加残忍的暴行的高潮。在这方面，他指出法国在撒哈拉进行原子爆炸和最近南非联邦政府屠杀非洲人民这两件事。但是，他说，这将“标志着结束外国在非洲的霸权和统治的开端”。
    恩克鲁玛说，非洲所有独立国家必须共同采取积极行动来对付这些事。同时，他主张这种行动应当受到甘地精神和非暴力原则的鼓舞。他建议，从非洲大陆各地组织游行队伍到法国原子试验场去举行和平抗议。
    会议将设立三个委员会：第一个委员会讨论反对法国核爆炸和南非种族隔离政策的积极行动的问题；第二个委员会研究非洲独立国家对原子弹试验、阿尔及利亚问题和南非问题所能采取的具体行动；第三个委员会讨论帝国主义企图分裂非洲、把非洲“巴尔干化”的问题以及采取怎样的斗争办法来反对殖民主义国家为保持它们在非洲的地位而作的最后挣扎。
    新华社6日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天打电报给将在加纳阿克拉举行的非洲国家及政党紧急会议说，中国亚非团结委员会对非洲人民争取民族独立和反对法国在撒哈拉进行核武器试验的斗争表示热烈的支持。
    预定4月7日到9日举行的这次会议，将要讨论今后采取什么行动来防止非洲被再次利用为核武器试验场，使非洲人民警惕殖民主义的新形式，警惕殖民主义者想分裂非洲、破坏非洲团结的阴谋等。已经有二十多个非洲国家的代表表示将参加这次会议。
    中国亚非团结委员会在电报中对这次会议表示热烈的祝贺。电报说：“正在蓬勃发展的非洲人民民族独立运动的洪流，是任何殖民主义势力所阻挡不了的。
    “我们祝会议为团结非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立、反对种族歧视和维护世界和平的正义事业作出新的贡献，并祝会议成功。”
