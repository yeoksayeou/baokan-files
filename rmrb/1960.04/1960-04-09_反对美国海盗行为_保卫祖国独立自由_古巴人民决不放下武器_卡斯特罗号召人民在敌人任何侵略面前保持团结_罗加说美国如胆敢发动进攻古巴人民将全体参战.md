Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th – Cuban Prime Minister Castro, while giving a speech yesterday to the militia of Pinar del Río Province, condemned the air raids and sugarcane field burning activities carried out by planes from the United States. He called on the people to maintain unity in the face of any aggression launched by the enemies of the revolution. Castro praised the militia's perfect organization and excellent discipline.

Castro's remarks were made at the graduation ceremony for militia instructors held at the San Julian military base in Pinar del Río Province. At this ceremony, a review of worker, farmer, and student militias was held. The militias also presented Prime Minister Castro with donations from cooperative farmers and merchants to purchase weapons and aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th – Roca, the General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, who is currently visiting Czechoslovakia, condemned at a press conference in Prague the imperialists' attempts to destroy the Cuban revolution by any means. He said that the road to the Cuban revolution's victory showed that in Latin America it is possible to establish an independent sovereign state that defends the interests of its people and does not represent Washington. Roca called for attention to the crimes of American pilots, who are dropping incendiary bombs over sugarcane fields. Within a month, they burned down large areas of sugarcane fields, the sugarcane harvest of which amounts to about two hundred thousand kilograms. Roca emphasized that despite the U.S. adopting this piratical behavior, last year Cuban sugar production reached six million tons, exceeding the plan by about four hundred thousand tons.

He said: "The Cuban people will not yield to pressure; they have decided that if necessary, they will endure hunger. The Cuban people would rather die fighting than lay down their arms in the face of counter-revolutionary forces. The slogan 'Sacrifice for the country' expresses their firm will to defend their sovereignty."

Roca said that now there are 100,000 workers and farmers in the Cuban militia prepared to defend the country. "If the U.S. attacks us, then the entire Cuban people will participate in the war."

    反对美国海盗行为　保卫祖国独立自由
    古巴人民决不放下武器
    卡斯特罗号召人民在敌人任何侵略面前保持团结
    罗加说美国如胆敢发动进攻古巴人民将全体参战
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗昨天对比那尔德里奥省的民兵发表演说时，谴责来自美国的飞机所进行的空袭和焚烧甘蔗田的活动，他号召人民在革命敌人所发动的任何侵略面前保持团结。卡斯特罗称赞了民兵的完善的组织和优良的纪律。
    卡斯特罗的这些话是在比那尔德里奥省的军事基地圣胡利安举行的民兵教练员毕业典礼上讲的。在这次仪式上，举行了工人、农民和学生民兵的检阅。民兵们还把合作社的农民和商人用来购买武器和飞机的捐款交给了卡斯特罗总理。
    新华社布拉格7日电　现在在捷克斯洛伐克访问的古巴人民社会党总书记罗加，在布拉格举行的记者招待会上谴责帝国主义者千方百计地企图摧毁古巴的革命。他说，古巴革命胜利的道路表明，在拉丁美洲能够建立一个维护自己人民的利益、不代表华盛顿的独立的主权国家。罗加要求注意美国飞行员的罪行，他们在甘蔗园的上空投掷燃烧弹。在一个月的时间内，他们烧毁了大片甘蔗园，这些蔗园的甘蔗收获量大约为二十万公斤。罗加强调指出，尽管美国采取这种海盗式的行为，去年古巴蔗糖的生产达到六百万吨，超过计划约四十万吨。
    他说：“古巴人民将不向压力屈服，他们决定，如果有必要的话，他们将忍受饥饿。古巴人民宁愿战死，而决不在反革命势力面前放下武器。‘为国牺牲’的口号表示了他们维护主权的坚强意志。”
    罗加说，现在古巴有十万名工人和农民组成的民兵准备保卫国家。“如果美国向我们进攻，那么，全体古巴人民都将参加作战。”
