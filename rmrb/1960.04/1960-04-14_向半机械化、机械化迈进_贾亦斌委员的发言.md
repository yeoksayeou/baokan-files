Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and I will resolutely implement them in my work.

Now, I would like to report to the assembly on the main situation of ten people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai that I inspected, as they move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization, and share some of my own views.

Like people's communes across the country, the people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai, in order to victoriously realize the 1960 leap forward plan and lay a good foundation for the continuous leap forward in the entire 1960s, are launching a magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement with irresistible force. Innovative creations are blooming everywhere, and a boiling scene like that of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958 has emerged.

Currently, they are mainly engaged in accumulating manure. The Xu Jing Commune in Qingpu has manufactured more than 70 earthen cranes in order to overfulfill the manure accumulation task. In ten days, Qingpu County has modified and repaired more than 1,000 kinds of manure accumulation tools.

The spring plowing and rice transplanting season has not yet arrived, but the communes are actively preparing rice transplanters. Most of what we saw was the No. 1 model produced by Nanhui County. This rice transplanter is almost entirely made of wood, with low cost, about 30 yuan per unit, but high efficiency, capable of transplanting nine seedlings at a time. This was mainly invented by an old farmer. The Tanzhao Commune has also created a combined tillage and harrowing machine. During tillage, the plowshare and harrow blades under its body operate simultaneously, turning over the entire clod of soil with the plowshare and crushing it instantly with the harrow blades. This machine breaks through the long-standing procedure of plowing first and then harrowing, increasing work efficiency more than tenfold.

As for electric threshers, every commune has them, with some communes having as many as 600. Almost all rice threshing is now done without manual labor.

On the basis of individual tool reforms, a new development of "complete sets" has emerged. For example, the Luodian Commune has created and promoted five sets of new farm tools, a total of 44 types and 309 pieces, enabling the main procedures of production operations in five production projects, such as spring plowing and spring sowing, water conservancy manure accumulation, animal husbandry, vegetables, and cooking, to achieve assembly line operations, greatly accelerating the progress of preparatory work for spring plowing. Therefore, the commune members say: "Complete sets of tools are better than gods descending to earth, clever work has endless potential, and one person can do the work of many."

In the past, there were relatively few pigs and chickens raised in the suburbs of Shanghai. Since last year, many pigs and chickens have been raised. The Huacao Commune alone has raised 63,000 pigs, an average of more than two per mu. They say: "Farming without raising pigs is like a scholar not reading books." With more pigs raised, the feeding methods must be improved. Through technological innovation, four modernizations have now been achieved, namely, water self-supply, transportation vehicle-ization, feed processing mechanization, and manure self-flow. Also, almost every commune has electric incubators for hatching chickens. This machine can incubate 16,000 chickens at a time. What is even more gratifying is that these machines are mostly manufactured by commune-run factories themselves. In addition, the Jiefang Commune in Qingpu is experimenting with using electric nets to catch fish.

As for the transportation problem in the rural suburbs, transportation is also gradually being done by vehicles and boats. Some communes have several trucks, and some communes have small motorboats. Basically, there is no more shoulder carrying.

The rural suburbs of Shanghai have not only created the above achievements, but are also gradually being armed with machinery and electricity. Almost all the communes we visited have purchased tractors, with the most having twenty-four. Communes such as Maqiao, Pengpu, and Changzheng have basically achieved tractor tillage. Therefore, they have transferred many cattle to dairy cows. The commune members say: "Plowing the land without cattle was just a dream in the past, but now it has gradually become a reality."

Because Shanghai's suburbs have many paddy fields, the use of tractors is still somewhat limited. Shanghai has successfully trial-produced an electric plow. As long as people press the button, the electric plow will automatically plow back and forth in the field. One control platform can manage several electric plows. Each electric plow costs only 2,000 yuan and can plow more than three mu of land per hour, with a depth of seven to eight inches. If it is used in large quantities in the future, it will not only be "plowing without cattle" but also further "plowing without people," or at least with fewer people.

Also, because the Shanghai area is prone to drought and even more prone to waterlogging. Since liberation, especially after the people's communes were formed, in addition to digging rivers and building dikes, large-scale irrigation projects have been carried out. The Pengpu Commune has forty-five water pumps. There is also artificial rainfall. The Maqiao Commune has twenty-nine electric irrigation stations, almost all using electric irrigation. Although it did not rain for dozens of days last year, it still guaranteed a 7% increase in production. These electric irrigation machines are mostly used for both drainage and irrigation. Irrigation in dry weather and drainage in flood season. The commune members said: "In the past, using foot-operated waterwheels had three pains: butt pain, shoulder pain, and sole pain. Now using electric irrigation, there is only one pleasure."

The emergence of semi-mechanization and mechanization in the rural suburbs of Shanghai is by no means accidental. First of all, the Party's general line of socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, mainly indigenous, starting with indigenous methods, and moving from indigenous to foreign, are extremely correct and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The Party's correct line and policies, when grasped by the masses, become a material force. Second, is the unlimited vitality of the people's communes. Because the people's communes are large, manpower and material resources can be used in a unified manner, especially the commune-run industries that are blooming everywhere, which fully play their role, and they gradually achieve self-equipment. Third, is the infinite wisdom and creativity of the liberated working people. They deeply understand that only by developing production at high speed can they create a more beautiful life. They truly have a strong desire to accelerate the elimination of the "poor and blank" face and heavy physical labor, and thus, under the leadership of the Party, quickly launched a mass upsurge of semi-mechanization and mechanization. They sing: "The people's commune is good, the people's commune is good, the people's commune is incredibly big. Mechanization comes to cultivate the land, the tide of technological innovation is high." Fourth, is the strong support of the state. The Party and the government have adopted the supply of equipment, technical guidance, and interest-free loans, etc., so that their rural technological innovation is faster and better.

What has been said above is only the beginning of rural technological innovation and technological revolution. I firmly believe that with the increasing development of national construction, the increasing power of the people's communes, and the continued deepening of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement on all fronts, the goals proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to strive for a small solution in four years, a solution in seven years, and a large solution in ten years, will certainly be completed ahead of schedule. The old saying in our country, "relying on heaven for food," will inevitably be replaced by the saying "man will conquer nature," and the heroic slogan put forward by the working people, "making heaven bow its head and demanding the earth to surrender," will certainly be realized in the near future.

### 向半机械化、机械化迈进  贾亦斌委员的发言

专栏：

    向半机械化、机械化迈进
    贾亦斌委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告和陈叔通副主席所作的常务委员会的工作报告，并坚决在工作中加以贯彻。
    现在，我想把我在上海郊区农村视察的十个人民公社向半机械化、机械化迈进的主要情况向大会汇报一下，并谈谈自己一些看法。
    上海郊区农村人民公社和全国各地一样，为了胜利地实现1960年的跃进计划，为整个六十年代持续跃进打下良好基础，正以破竹之势，开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动。革新创举到处开花，出现了像1958年大炼钢铁时候那样的沸腾景象。
    目前他们主要搞积肥，青浦徐泾公社为了超额完成积肥任务，赶制了七十多架土起重机，在十天中，青浦一个县改制和修理了一千多种积肥工具。
    春耕插秧季节还没有到，但是各个公社都在积极筹备插秧机，我们所见到的大都是南汇县出品的第一号。这种插秧机几乎全部是用木制的，成本低，每架约三十多元，但效率高，每次可以同时插九棵秧。这主要是一个老农发明的。炭桥公社还创造了一种耕耙联合机，在耕作时，它的机身下的铧犁和耙刀一齐运行，把整块的泥土用铧犁翻过来，一下子又给耙刀粉碎了。这种机器冲破了长期以来的先犁后耙的程序，提高工效十倍以上。
    至于电动脱粒机，各个公社都有，有的公社就有六百多台之多，已经做到打稻子全部不再打了。
    在逐个工具改革的基础上，进而成为“配套成龙”的新发展。如罗店公社已创造和推广了五套新式农具，共四十四种三百零九件，使春耕春播、水利积肥、畜牧、蔬菜、炊事等五个生产项目的生产操作过程的主要程序实现了流水作业，大大加快了备耕工作的进展。因此社员们说：“工具配套成龙，赛过神仙下凡，巧干潜力无穷，一人能顶多人”。
    过去，上海郊区养猪、养鸡是比较少的，自去年以来，猪鸡养得很多，单华漕公社就养了六万三千头猪，平均每亩两头多，他们说：“种地不养猪，好比秀才不读书。”猪养多了，就得改进饲养方法，经过技术革新，现已做到四化，即用水自来化、运输车子化、饲料加工机械化、粪便自流化。又孵鸡用的电孵机，差不多各社都有，这个机器，一次可以孵一万六千只。更可喜的，这种机器多是社办工厂自己制造的。还有青浦的解放公社他们正在试用以电网捕鱼。
    至于郊区农村运输问题，也逐步做到运输车船化。有的公社有几个卡车，有的公社有小汽船，基本上看不到什么肩挑背驮了。
    上海郊区农村不仅创造以上成绩，而且还在逐步用机械和电气武装起来。我们所到公社，几乎都购置有拖拉机，最多的一个公社有二十四台。如马桥、彭浦、长征等公社已基本上做到了用拖拉机耕种了，因此，他们把不少耕牛移做了奶牛。社员们说：“耕地不用牛，在过去不过是梦想，现在已逐步成为现实了”。
    由于上海郊区水田多，使用拖拉机还受到一定限制，上海试制成功了一种电犁，只要人们一按电钮，电犁就在田间自动犁来犁去。一个操纵台可以管几个电犁，每一电犁成本只二千元，一小时可耕三亩多地，深度七至八寸。今后如大量使用，不仅“耕地不用牛”而且进一步“耕地不用人”，至少是少用人了。
    又由于上海地区容易受旱更易受涝。解放以来，特别是人民公社化后，除了开河筑堤之外，还大办灌溉事业。彭浦公社就有抽水机四十五台。还有人工降雨。马桥公社有二十九个电力灌溉站，几乎全部用电力灌溉。去年虽然接连几十天不下雨，但仍然保证增产7％。这些电力灌溉机多是排灌两用的，旱时灌，涝时排，社员们说：“过去用脚车水，有三个痛苦：屁股痛、肩膀痛、脚底痛，现在用电力灌溉，只有一个痛快了”。
    上海郊区农村出现半机械化、机械化情况，决不是偶然的。首先是党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，采取土洋结合，以土为主，土法上马，由土到洋的无比正确，而且深入人心。党的正确路线方针为群众所掌握，就变成物质的力量。其次，是人民公社的无限生命力，由于人民公社大，人力物力可以统筹使用，特别是遍地开花的社办工业，充分发挥作用，它们逐步做到自己装备自己。第三、是解放了的劳动人民的无穷智慧和创造，他们深深懂得要高速度发展生产，才能创造更加美满的生活。他们真有加速摆脱“一穷二白”的面貌和繁重体力劳动的强烈愿望，因而在党的领导下，迅速掀起了群众性的半机械化、机械化的高潮。他们歌唱说：“人民公社好，人民公社好，人民公社大得不得了。机械化来耕田，技术革新浪潮高。”第四、是国家大力的支援，党和政府采取了供给装备、技术指导和无利贷款等等，这样就使他们农村技术革新得更快更好。
    以上所说，还仅仅是农村技术革新、技术革命的开始，我坚决相信：随着国家建设的日益发展，人民公社的威力日益发挥，各个战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动继续深入发展，党中央和毛主席提出的争取四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决的目标，一定可以提前完成的。我国一句“靠天吃饭”的老话，必然会被“人定胜天”的话所代替，劳动人民提出的“令天低头，要地投降”的英雄口号，也一定在不久的将来必能成为现实。
