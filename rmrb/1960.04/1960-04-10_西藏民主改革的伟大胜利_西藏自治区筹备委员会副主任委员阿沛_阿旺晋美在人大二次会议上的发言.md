Chairman, fellow deputies:

I fully agree with the reports made to the Congress by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. I am prepared to briefly report on the main work situation in Tibet.

As you all know, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and in the excellent situation of the overall leap forward in socialist construction across the country, Tibet has undergone fundamental changes in the past short year. Contrary to the wishes of reactionary forces at home and abroad, the counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group in collusion with imperialism and foreign reactionaries has been swiftly quelled, the earth-shaking democratic reform movement has achieved a great victory, the dark, reactionary, cruel, and barbaric feudal serf system supported by imperialism and foreign reactionaries has been destroyed, the feudal privileges and feudal exploitation of monasteries have been basically abolished, the serfs and slaves who have been deeply oppressed and exploited for generations have been emancipated, people's democratic power in the special districts and counties has been established, the unity of the motherland and the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, as well as the unity of all nationalities, have been further consolidated and strengthened. All of these have ensured that the Tibetan people have embarked on the path of democracy and socialism. Now, the broad masses of Tibetans who have been liberated are elated, jubilant, and celebrating the success of their own liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, celebrating their mastery of their own destiny. With gratitude, they love the Chinese Communist Party, our great leader Chairman Mao, and the heroic People's Liberation Army. They recognize that the Tibetan people are forever members of the great family of the motherland, and they are determined to forever follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao on the bright road of socialism and communism. Any destructive activities by reactionary forces at home and abroad that attempt to split the unity of the motherland and undermine the unity of all nationalities in our country will never succeed.

Currently, on the basis of the victory of democratic reform, the broad masses of working people have organized mutual aid teams and are launching a vigorous and unprecedented patriotic production increase movement with full vigor, creating an excellent situation of production leap forward that has never been seen before in the Tibetan region.

The experience of the past year has proven that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of "suppressing rebellion while reforming" and the democratic reform policy of full consultation from top to bottom and full mobilization of the masses from bottom to top are completely correct and fully in line with the actual situation and the demands of the people in Tibet. Under the direct leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, we conscientiously implemented the principles and policies determined by the Central Committee, and the democratic reform movement in the entire region developed healthily, rapidly, and vigorously, achieving a great victory in a short period of one year.

The democratic reform movement in Tibet began in June last year. Democratic reform is divided into two steps: the first step is to implement "three antis and two reductions" (opposing rebellion, opposing the Ula corvée system, opposing personal dependence, and reducing rent and interest), and the second step is to distribute land. According to statistics up to the end of February this year, democratic reform movements have been carried out in 57 counties with a population of approximately 790,000 in agricultural areas. Among them, 49 counties with a population of approximately 690,000 have completed the "three antis and two reductions" movement. On this basis, 47 counties with a population of 610,000 have completed the reform of the land system. In pastoral areas, 12 counties with a population of approximately 75,000 have carried out the "three antis and two benefits" (benefits for both herders and herd owners) movement, of which approximately 30,000 people have victoriously concluded this movement. There are 2,469 monasteries in the Tibet region, with more than 110,000 monks and nuns. 1,700 monasteries, including more than 56,000 monks and nuns, have completed or are about to complete the "three antis" movement. With the exception of a few remote areas, the democratic reform movement throughout the region will be victoriously completed before planting this year.

In terms of reform methods, we followed the central government's guidelines, fully mobilized the masses, and at the same time, did a good job in upper-level united front work, implementing a differentiated policy. For the land, surplus houses, cattle, and farm tools owned by serf owners and their agents who did not participate in the rebellion, we implemented redemption. In the struggle of the masses, serf owners and their agents who were anti-imperialist, patriotic, and accepted democratic reform were given protection and allowed to "pass the test." At the same time, arrangements were made for them politically and appropriate care was given to them in their lives, according to their specific circumstances. The land, houses, cattle, and farm tools of the serf owners who participated in the rebellion were confiscated and distributed to the peasants. The families of the rebels were given a share of land like the peasants. These facts fully demonstrate that the Party and the People's Government implemented a lenient policy towards serf owners in the democratic reform in Tibet.

In pastoral areas, we implemented the policy of "three antis and two benefits," "no class division, no struggle, no division," abolished the feudal privileges of herd owners, and implemented benefits for both herders and herd owners. This not only stimulated the enthusiasm of herders and herdsmen in protecting and developing livestock, but also allowed herd owners to focus on the development of animal husbandry and actively engage in management. For the livestock owned by herd owners who participated in the rebellion, we implemented a policy of confiscation and ownership by the herdsmen.

In monastery work, we resolutely implemented the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief, protected patriotic and law-abiding monasteries and lamas, and carried out the "three antis and two reductions" movement in the monasteries. We implemented a redemption policy for the land and other means of production owned by monasteries that did not participate in the rebellion, abolished all feudal privileges and feudal exploitation systems of the monasteries, and resolutely cracked down on all counter-revolutionary activities carried out by using religion. After the implementation of democratic reform, the People's Government provided appropriate subsidies to monasteries whose monks and nuns could not afford their living expenses. After this great revolutionary movement, the class consciousness of the masses of monks and nuns was raised, and they participated in the democratic management of the monasteries. Therefore, they felt comfortable, enthusiastic about learning, and asked to participate in labor and other social activities, and they arranged their own religious activities themselves. They truly and comprehensively realized that the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief was completely correct.

In terms of united front work at the upper level, since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Party and the upper-level figures in Tibet have established a broad united front. Because the upper-level reactionary group that attempted to split the unity of the motherland and undermine national unity had embarked on a path of self-destruction, the people's democratic united front in Tibet has become stronger. Due to the Party's unity and education, the redemption policy, and appropriate arrangements in politics and life (of which more than 500 upper and middle-level figures receive state salaries and living expenses), patriotic and progressive upper and middle-level figures actively supported democratic reform, comfortably carried out self-transformation, and were willing to contribute to the construction of a new socialist Tibet together with the working people.

Conscientiously implementing the mass line working method instructed by the Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, and fully mobilizing the masses is the key to successfully completing the task of democratic reform. We followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, believed in the masses in our work, relied on the masses, consulted with the masses on everything, and conscientiously implemented the "three togethers and one exchange" instruction put forward by the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, that is, whether Han Chinese or Tibetan workers, they must eat, live, and work together with the masses, and exchange hearts with the masses, extensively and deeply mobilized the masses, and led the masses to participate in the great democratic reform movement of liberating themselves. In all the areas undergoing reform, mass meetings to dig up the roots of poverty and tell of grievances were generally held. Serfs who had not had enough to eat or wear for generations and lived a life worse than cattle and horses stood up one after another to tell of the oppression and suffering they had suffered in the past, and burned with excitement and anger all kinds of contracts that had made them suffer exploitation and oppression for thousands of years. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Han Chinese and Tibetan workers, the broad masses of peasants and herdsmen, through the tempering of the reform struggle, established their own organizations - peasant (herdsmen) associations. For example, the Shannan Special District has established 290 peasant associations with more than 76,800 members; the Nagqu Special District has established 63 herdsmen associations with more than 30,000 members. In the democratic reform, the peasant (herdsmen) associations acted on behalf of the functions of grassroots political power, realized the slogan of "all rights belong to the peasant associations," and trained and cultivated a large number of activists. According to statistics from the three special districts of Lhasa, Shannan, and Nagqu, more than 46,800 activists from the working people emerged and were cultivated in the movement, and they have become the backbone force in the countryside for implementing the instructions of the Party and the People's Government at higher levels. Now, the power organs at the special district and county levels in the entire Tibet region have been established. The grassroots political power in the vast countryside will be gradually established through the upcoming democratic reform review movement.

The Tibetan people have gained rich fruits of struggle in this vigorous democratic revolution movement. The broad masses of serfs and slaves have gained complete liberation, distributed land and other means of production. In areas where land distribution has been completed, more than 2.1 million ke of land (one ke of land is equivalent to one mu) has been distributed to the peasants, with an average of 3.5 ke per person; due to the implementation of the policies of "whoever plants it harvests it," "reducing rent and interest," and abolishing old debts, the economic benefits obtained by the working people are equivalent to more than 1 billion jin of grain, with an average of more than 1,500 jin per person. Through the tempering of this great revolutionary struggle, the class consciousness of the broad peasant and herdsmen masses has been greatly improved. They said: "The sun of the Kashag (referring to the original Tibetan local government) shines on the three major landlords and their agents, and the sun of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao shines on us poor people." "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have made us the masters of the land." They enthusiastically praised: "Chairman Mao is the father of all ethnic groups in the motherland, even closer than our own parents. The Communist Party is truly for the people, and the Communist Party cadres are the cadres of our Tibetan people." They said: "The words spoken by the upper-level reactionaries are the same as ours, but their hearts are different from ours. The words spoken by the Han Chinese cadres are different from ours, but their hearts are the same as ours." The victory of democratic reform has filled the Tibetan people with confidence in their future. The great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland has made them even more yearning for a happy socialist life. In the months immediately following the end of the reform, they widely launched a upsurge in organizing mutual aid teams on a voluntary basis. In the four special districts of Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, and Xigaze, 4,741 mutual aid teams have been established, with more than 37,900 households participating in the mutual aid teams. In the Nyingchi Special District, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams accounts for 80% of the total number of households in the district. In the Shannan Special District, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams has reached 93% of the total number of households in the district.

The victory of democratic reform and the complete destruction of the serf system greatly liberated rural productive forces, and a vigorous high tide of striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year is rising. The broad masses of peasants are full of vigor, and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. Since last winter, the entire region has built a total of 3,000 canals, extending 3,000 li, repaired 300 reservoirs, and expanded the irrigated area by more than 370,000 ke. This has expanded the irrigated area of the entire region from the original 65% to 95%. In the Shannan Special District alone, approximately 4 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated, with an average of 17,000 jin of fertilizer applied per ke of land. At the same time, 33 chemical fertilizer plants have been established, producing more than 75,000 jin of chemical fertilizer. In many places, the cultivated land was plowed once at most in previous years. After the reform, more than 95% of the cultivated land in the entire region has been plowed once, of which 53% of the cultivated land has been plowed twice, and 28% of the cultivated land has been plowed three times. In the past, Tibet did not have a single piece of new-style agricultural equipment. A large number of new-style agricultural equipment allocated to Tibet by the central government in 1955 failed to be distributed due to the obstruction of the upper-level reactionary group. This year, these new-style agricultural equipment were distributed and were warmly welcomed by the peasant masses. The broad masses of peasants liberated their minds and actively improved old-style agricultural equipment. People broke the superstition that "women's farming does not yield good harvests," and this year many women have learned to farm.

The 1960 production targets proposed by the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region require agricultural areas to increase production by 15% to 20% on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. After enthusiastic discussions by the peasant masses, they generally raised it to 20% to 30%, and some places proposed to increase production by 40% to 50%, and some experimental fields and high-yield fields proposed a target of doubling production, and they all formulated production increase plans. At present, the production targets have been implemented to mutual aid teams, households, and fields. With the development of production, movements to talk about hygiene and learn culture have been successively launched. Many people-run primary schools and adult cultural schools and night schools have been opened in various places. Some areas have also built roads, carried out greening, and some cities and towns have also organized production and employment to resettle the old, weak, disabled. In pastoral areas, the broad masses of working herdsmen are conducting a resolute struggle against the severe cold of the plateau and other natural disasters with soaring energy. Under the leadership of the Party committees and people's governments at all levels and the herdsmen associations, they are actively repairing pens, storing grass, and making felt. In the Nagqu Special District alone, incomplete statistics show that more than 1.6 million jin of winter grass has been stored, 4,000 livestock pens have been built, and more than 40,000 pieces of felt have been made. In addition, many different disaster prevention tools have been manufactured. In areas where the "three antis and two benefits" movement has been realized, men and women have participated in various production increase movements with soaring energy, and are working hard to protect livestock and rapidly develop animal husbandry production. In short, in Tibet, whether it is agricultural areas, pastoral areas, or cities and towns, everywhere is full of a thriving new scene.

The above simple situation fully shows that the Tibetans and the people of Tibet have definitely embarked on a new stage of socialist rapid development and prosperity.

However, when we were suppressing the rebellion and carrying out democratic reform in Tibet, imperialists and foreign reactionaries clamored endlessly that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army wanted to eliminate the nationalities and religions of Tibet, demanding that we stop the struggle to quell the rebellion and democratic reform, which is not worth refuting. The movement to quell the rebellion and carry out democratic reform in Tibet is a struggle between the broad masses of the Tibetan people and a small group of reactionary serf owners. It is an irreconcilable class struggle, not a national struggle. The purpose of the reform is precisely to develop the politics, economy, culture, and population of the Tibetan nationality, to eradicate the oppression and exploitation system of religion, and to truly realize freedom of religious belief. Now, due to the victory of suppressing the rebellion and democratic reform, the Tibetan region has presented an unprecedented new and vibrant scene, and the Tibetan nationality has embarked on a new stage of national development and national prosperity, which more ruthlessly indicates how absurd and ridiculous the above clamor of imperialism and foreign reactionaries is. Imperialists and foreign reactionaries also clamor that "the basic human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people have been deprived" and demand "respect for the unique way of life of the Tibetan people," which is of course also very absurd and ridiculous.

Obviously, the basic human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people they are talking about specifically refer to the rights and freedoms of a small group of reactionary serf owners in Tibet to cruelly oppress serfs, exploit serfs, and slaughter serfs, and the unique way of life of the Tibetan people they are talking about refers to the barbaric and cannibalistic serf system. Their frantic clamoring is nothing more than an attempt to guarantee the rights and freedoms of the Tibetan serf owner class to kill and seize from the serf class, and nothing more than wanting us to never touch this extremely dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system in Tibet. Let them spread rumors and slander. The millions of serfs who originally had no basic human rights and freedoms have stood up, and they have crushed the serf system with their own hands, making themselves the masters of the new society and gaining true rights and freedoms as human beings. In the future, under the wise leadership of the Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the Tibetan people will surely further consolidate the unity of the motherland and strengthen national unity with their own actions, thoroughly complete democratic reform, vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, and work together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country to set high goals, establish great ambitions, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new socialist Tibet in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    西藏民主改革的伟大胜利
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员阿沛·阿旺晋美在人大二次会议上的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理向大会作的报告。我准备简单的汇报一下西藏的主要工作情况。
    正如诸位所知道的，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国社会主义建设全面大跃进的大好形势下，西藏在过去短短的一年中，发生了根本性的变化。和国内外反动势力的愿望相反，西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国反动派所发动的反革命叛乱已经被迅速平定，翻天复地的民主改革运动已经取得了伟大的胜利，为帝国主义和外国反动派所支持的黑暗、反动、残酷、野蛮的封建农奴制度被摧毁了，寺庙的封建特权和封建剥削基本上废除了，世世代代深受压迫和剥削的农奴和奴隶群众翻身了，专区和县的人民民主政权建立起来了，祖国的统一和汉藏民族的团结以及各民族的团结更加巩固和加强了，所有这些，使西藏人民确定的走上了民主和社会主义的道路。现在，翻了身的广大藏族人民扬眉吐气，欢欣鼓舞，高奏凯歌，庆贺在共产党、毛主席的领导下，自己解放自己的成功，庆贺自己作了自己命运的主人。他们怀着感激的心情热爱中国共产党，热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，热爱英勇的人民解放军。他们认定西藏人民永远是祖国大家庭中的一员，他们决心要永远跟着共产党、毛主席走社会主义和共产主义的光明大道。任何国内外反动派妄图分裂祖国的统一、破坏我国各民族的团结的破坏活动，是永远不能得逞的。
      目前，在民主改革胜利的基础上，广大的劳动人民已经组织了互助组，正在以十足的干劲，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的史无前例的爱国增产运动，使西藏地区出现了从来没有过的生产跃进的大好形势。
    一年来的经验证明了党中央和毛主席所确定的“边平叛边改革”的方针和由上而下充分协商和由下而上充分发动群众的民主改革方针，是完全正确的，是完全符合西藏实际情况和人民的要求的。在中共西藏工委的直接领导下，我们认真地贯彻执行了中央所确定的方针和政策，全区的民主改革运动就健康地、迅速猛烈地开展起来，在短短的一年时间里取得了伟大的胜利。
    西藏的民主改革运动是在去年6月开始的。民主改革分为两个步骤：第一步，实行“三反双减”（反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对人身依附和减租减息），第二步再实行分配土地。截至今年2月底的统计，在农业区，已经有五十七个县约七十九万人口的地区，开展了民主改革运动。其中四十九个县约六十九万人口的地区，已经完成了“三反双减”运动，在这个基础上有四十七个县六十一万人口的地区完成了土地制度的改革。在牧业区，有十二个县约七万五千人口的地区开展了“三反”和“两利”（牧工、牧主两利）运动，其中约三万人口的地区已经胜利的结束了这个运动。西藏全区有寺庙二千四百六十九座，僧尼十一万多人，已经完成或者即将完成“三反”运动的寺庙有一千七百座，包括僧尼五万六千多人。除了少数边远地区以外，全区的民主改革运动将在今年播种以前胜利完成。
    在改革的方法上，我们遵照中央指示的方针，在充分发动群众的基础上，同时做好上层统战工作，实行区别对待的政策，对于没有参加叛乱的农奴主及其代理人所占有的土地和多余的房屋、耕牛、农具等，实行赎买。在群众的斗争中，对于反帝爱国、接受民主改革的农奴主及其代理人，分别给予保护“过关”，同时，根据他们各人的具体情况，分别在政治上给予安排，在生活上给予适当的照顾。对于参加叛乱的农奴主的土地、房屋、耕牛、农具等实行没收，分配给农民。对叛乱分子的家属，和农民同样分给一份土地。这些事实充分证明，党和人民政府在西藏的民主改革中，对农奴主实行了宽大的政策。
    在牧业区，我们贯彻执行了“三反两利”、“不划阶级、不斗不分”的政策，废除了牧主的封建特权，又实行了牧工、牧主两利。这样，既发挥了牧工、牧民保护和发展牲畜的积极性，也使牧主安心牧业的发展，积极地进行经营。对于参加叛乱的牧主所有的牲畜，实行了没收和归牧民所有的政策。
    在寺庙工作中，我们坚决贯彻执行了党的宗教信仰自由政策，保护爱国守法的寺庙和喇嘛，并且在寺庙中开展“三反双减”运动。对没有参加叛乱的寺庙所拥有的土地和其他生产资料，实行赎买政策，废除寺庙的一切封建特权和封建剥削制度，坚决打击利用宗教所进行的一切反革命活动。在实行民主改革以后，人民政府对于僧尼的生活费用不能自足的寺庙，给予适当的补助。经过这次伟大的革命运动，僧尼群众的阶级觉悟提高了，他们参加了寺庙的民主管理，因此，他们心情舒畅，热心学习，要求参加劳动和其他各种社会活动，并且由他们自己安排自己的宗教活动。他们真正的全面的体会到了党的宗教信仰自由政策是完全正确的。
    在上层统战工作上，西藏和平解放以来，党和西藏的上层人士建立了广泛的统一战线，由于妄图分裂祖国统一、破坏民族团结的上层反动集团已经走上了自取灭亡的道路，西藏的人民民主统一战线更加壮大了。由于党的团结教育、赎买政策和在政治上、生活上适当安排（其中约有五百余名上、中层人士领取国家的薪金和生活费），爱国进步的上、中层人士积极地拥护民主改革，心情舒畅地进行自我改造，并且愿意和劳动人民一道，为建设社会主义的新西藏而贡献自己的力量。
    认真贯彻党中央和伟大领袖毛主席所指示的群众路线的工作方法，充分发动群众，这是胜利完成民主改革任务的关键。我们遵循着党中央和毛主席的指示，在工作中相信群众，依靠群众，遇事和群众商量，并且认真贯彻了中共西藏工委所提出的无论汉族工作人员，或是藏族工作人员都要同群众同吃、同住、同劳动以及同群众交心的“三同一交”的指示，广泛深入地发动了群众，领导群众投入了轰轰烈烈的自己解放自己的伟大的民主改革运动。所有进行改革的地区都普遍的召开了群众挖穷根诉苦大会，祖祖辈辈吃不饱穿不暖，过着牛马不如的生活的农奴，纷纷站起来申诉了过去所受的压迫和痛苦，激昂愤慨地烧毁了千百年来使他们惨遭剥削压迫的种种契约。广大的农牧民，在党的领导下，在汉、藏工作人员的帮助下，经过改革斗争的锻炼，建立了自己的组织——农（牧）民协会。例如山南专区已经成立了农民协会二百九十个，有会员七万六千八百多人；那曲专区成立了牧民协会六十三个，有会员三万多人。在民主改革中，农（牧）民协会代行了基层政权的职能，实现了“一切权利归农民协会”的口号，并且锻炼和培养了大批的积极分子。据拉萨、山南、那曲三个专区的统计，在运动中共涌现和培养了劳苦人民出身的积极分子四万六千八百多名，他们已经成为农村中贯彻执行上级党和人民政府的指示的骨干力量。现在，西藏全区的专区和县一级的政权机构已经建立起来。广大农村的基层政权，将通过今后的民主改革复查运动逐步予以建立。
    西藏人民在这场轰轰烈烈的民主革命运动中，获得了丰富的斗争果实。广大的农奴和奴隶获得了彻底的解放，分得了土地和其他生产资料，在已经完成土地分配的地区，分配给农民的土地有二百一十万余克（一克地相当于一市亩），每人平均得到三克半；由于实行了“谁种谁收”，“减租减息”和废除旧债等政策，劳动人民所得的经济利益折合粮食达十亿多斤，平均每人可得一千五百多斤。广大的农牧民群众经过这一场伟大的革命斗争的锻炼，阶级觉悟大大提高了，他们说：“噶厦（指原西藏地方政府）的太阳照在三大领主和他们的代理人的身上，共产党和毛主席的太阳照在我们穷人身上。”“共产党和毛主席使我们变成了土地的主人。”他们热情的歌颂：“毛主席是祖国各族人民的父亲，比自己亲生的父母还亲。共产党真正为人民，共产党的干部是我们藏族人民的干部。”他们说：“上层反动分子讲的话和我们是一样的，他的心和我们不一样，汉族干部讲的话和我们是不一样的，但是他们的心和我们一样。”民主改革的胜利，使藏族人民对自己的未来充满了信心，祖国社会主义建设的大跃进，使他们对社会主义的幸福生活更加向往，在改革刚结束的几个月间，他们在自觉自愿的基础上广泛地掀起了组织互助组的热潮，在拉萨、山南、林芝、日喀则四个专区，已经成立了四千七百四十一个互助组，参加互助组的有三万七千九百余户。林芝专区参加互助组的农户占该区总户数的80％。山南专区参加互助组的农户已达到该区总户数的93％。
    民主改革的胜利，农奴制度的被彻底摧毁，大大地解放农村生产力，一个轰轰烈烈的争取今年农业生产大丰收的高潮正在兴起。广大农民群众意气风发，生产积极性空前高涨。去冬以来，全区共修水渠三千条，长达三千里，整修水库三百个，扩大灌溉面积三十七万余克。使全区的灌溉面积由原来的65％扩大到95％。仅山南一个专区，已经积肥约四十亿斤，平均每克土地可施肥一万七千斤，同时还建立了化肥厂三十三座，生产化肥七万五千余斤。许多地方的耕地，往年最多冬翻一次，改革后，全区95％以上的耕地已经翻了一遍，其中53％的耕地翻了两遍，28％的耕地翻了三遍。从前，西藏没有一件新式农具，1955年中央拨给西藏的大批新式农具，由于上层反动集团的阻挠，都未能发放出去。今年发放了这些新式农具，受到了农民群众的热烈欢迎。广大农民群众解放了思想，积极改良旧式农具。人们打破了从前“妇女耕地收成不好”的迷信，今年有许多妇女学会了耕地。
    中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹备委员会所提出的1960年生产指标，要求农业区在去年丰收的基础上，增产15％至20％。经过农民群众的热烈讨论，一般都提到20％至30％，有的地方提出要增产40％至50％，有的试验田、丰产田提出增产一倍的指标，并且都订出了增产规划。目前，生产指标已经落实到互助组、到户、到田。随着生产的发展，相继掀起了讲卫生学文化的运动。各地先后开办了很多的民办小学和成年人文化学校、夜校。有的地区还修筑了道路，进行了绿化，有的城镇还组织了生产就业，安置老弱残疾。在牧业区，广大的劳动牧民以冲天的干劲，向高原的严寒和其他自然灾害进行了坚决的斗争。他们在各级党委和人民政府以及牧民协会的领导下，积极地修圈、储草和制作毛毡。仅那曲专区不完全统计，储备了冬草一百六十万余斤，修建畜圈四千个，制作毛毡四万多件。此外还制造了很多不同的防御灾害的工具。在已经实现了“三反两利”运动的地区，男男女女都以冲天的干劲参加了各项增产运动，为保护牲畜和迅速地发展牧业生产而紧张劳动。总之，在西藏，无论是农业区、牧业区和城镇，到处都充满了欣欣向荣的新景象。
    以上简单情况充分说明，西藏藏族和西藏
  人民已经确定地走上了迅速发展繁荣的社会主义的新阶段。
    但是，当我们在西藏平息叛乱和进行民主改革的时候，帝国主义和外国反动派喋喋不休地叫嚷什么中国共产党和人民解放军要消灭西藏的民族和宗教，要求我们停止平定叛乱和民主改革的斗争，这是不值一驳的。西藏的平定叛乱和民主改革运动，是西藏的广大人民同一小撮反动的农奴主之间的斗争，是一场不可调和的阶级斗争，绝不是什么民族斗争。而改革所要达到的目的，正是要发展西藏民族的政治、经济、文化和人口，正是要革除宗教的压迫、剥削制度，真正实现宗教信仰自由。现在，由于平定叛乱和民主改革的胜利，西藏地区已经呈现出一片从来没有过的欣欣向荣和生气勃勃的新景象，西藏民族已经走上了民族发展和民族繁荣的崭新阶段，这就更加无情地指明帝国主义和外国反动派的上述叫嚷是多么荒谬，多么可笑。帝国主义和外国反动派还叫嚷什么“剥夺了西藏人民的基本人权和自由”，要求“尊重西藏人民的独特的生活方式”，这当然也是十分荒谬和可笑的。
    很明显，他们所说的西藏人民的基本人权和自由是专指西藏一小撮反动农奴主残酷地压迫农奴、剥削农奴、屠杀农奴的权利和自由，他们所说的西藏人民独特的生活方式是指野蛮的吃人的农奴制度，他们这样声嘶力竭的叫嚷，无非是妄图保障西藏农奴主阶级对农奴阶级生杀予夺的权利和自由，无非是要我们永远不去触动西藏的这个极端黑暗反动的残酷的农奴制度。让他们造谣、诽谤吧，原来没有丝毫基本人权和自由的百万农奴已经站起来了，他们用自己的双手，粉碎了农奴制度，使自己成为新社会的主人，获得了真正的做人的权利和自由。今后，西藏人民在党和各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，必将以自己的行动进一步巩固祖国的统一和加强民族团结，彻底完成民主改革，大力发展农牧业生产，同全国各族人民一道，树雄心，立大志，为多、快、好、省地建设繁荣幸福的社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
