Chairman, fellow deputies:

I fully agree with the reports made to the Congress by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. I am prepared to briefly report on the main work situation in Tibet.

As you all know, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and in the excellent situation of the overall leap forward in socialist construction across the country, Tibet has undergone fundamental changes in the past short year. Contrary to the wishes of reactionary forces at home and abroad, the counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group in collusion with imperialism and foreign reactionaries has been swiftly quelled, the earth-shaking democratic reform movement has achieved a great victory, the dark, reactionary, cruel, and barbaric feudal serf system supported by imperialism and foreign reactionaries has been destroyed, the feudal privileges and feudal exploitation of monasteries have been basically abolished, the serfs and slaves who have been deeply oppressed and exploited for generations have been emancipated, people's democratic power in the special districts and counties has been established, the unity of the motherland and the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, as well as the unity of all nationalities, have been further consolidated and strengthened. All of these have ensured that the Tibetan people have embarked on the path of democracy and socialism. Now, the broad masses of Tibetans who have been liberated are elated, jubilant, and celebrating the success of their own liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, celebrating their mastery of their own destiny. With gratitude, they love the Chinese Communist Party, our great leader Chairman Mao, and the heroic People's Liberation Army. They recognize that the Tibetan people are forever members of the great family of the motherland, and they are determined to forever follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao on the bright road of socialism and communism. Any destructive activities by reactionary forces at home and abroad that attempt to split the unity of the motherland and undermine the unity of all nationalities in our country will never succeed.

Currently, on the basis of the victory of democratic reform, the broad masses of working people have organized mutual aid teams and are launching a vigorous and unprecedented patriotic production increase movement with full vigor, creating an excellent situation of production leap forward that has never been seen before in the Tibetan region.

The experience of the past year has proven that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of "suppressing rebellion while reforming" and the democratic reform policy of full consultation from top to bottom and full mobilization of the masses from bottom to top are completely correct and fully in line with the actual situation and the demands of the people in Tibet. Under the direct leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, we conscientiously implemented the principles and policies determined by the Central Committee, and the democratic reform movement in the entire region developed healthily, rapidly, and vigorously, achieving a great victory in a short period of one year.

The democratic reform movement in Tibet began in June last year. Democratic reform is divided into two steps: the first step is to implement "three antis and two reductions" (opposing rebellion, opposing the Ula corv√©e system, opposing personal dependence, and reducing rent and interest), and the second step is to distribute land. According to statistics up to the end of February this year, democratic reform movements have been carried out in 57 counties with a population of approximately 790,000 in agricultural areas. Among them, 49 counties with a population of approximately 690,000 have completed the "three antis and two reductions" movement. On this basis, 47 counties with a population of 610,000 have completed the reform of the land system. In pastoral areas, 12 counties with a population of approximately 75,000 have carried out the "three antis and two benefits" (benefits for both herders and herd owners) movement, of which approximately 30,000 people have victoriously concluded this movement. There are 2,469 monasteries in the Tibet region, with more than 110,000 monks and nuns. 1,700 monasteries, including more than 56,000 monks and nuns, have completed or are about to complete the "three antis" movement. With the exception of a few remote areas, the democratic reform movement throughout the region will be victoriously completed before planting this year.

In terms of reform methods, we followed the central government's guidelines, fully mobilized the masses, and at the same time, did a good job in upper-level united front work, implementing a differentiated policy. For the land, surplus houses, cattle, and farm tools owned by serf owners and their agents who did not participate in the rebellion, we implemented redemption. In the struggle of the masses, serf owners and their agents who were anti-imperialist, patriotic, and accepted democratic reform were given protection and allowed to "pass the test." At the same time, arrangements were made for them politically and appropriate care was given to them in their lives, according to their specific circumstances. The land, houses, cattle, and farm tools of the serf owners who participated in the rebellion were confiscated and distributed to the peasants. The families of the rebels were given a share of land like the peasants. These facts fully demonstrate that the Party and the People's Government implemented a lenient policy towards serf owners in the democratic reform in Tibet.

In pastoral areas, we implemented the policy of "three antis and two benefits," "no class division, no struggle, no division," abolished the feudal privileges of herd owners, and implemented benefits for both herders and herd owners. This not only stimulated the enthusiasm of herders and herdsmen in protecting and developing livestock, but also allowed herd owners to focus on the development of animal husbandry and actively engage in management. For the livestock owned by herd owners who participated in the rebellion, we implemented a policy of confiscation and ownership by the herdsmen.

In monastery work, we resolutely implemented the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief, protected patriotic and law-abiding monasteries and lamas, and carried out the "three antis and two reductions" movement in the monasteries. We implemented a redemption policy for the land and other means of production owned by monasteries that did not participate in the rebellion, abolished all feudal privileges and feudal exploitation systems of the monasteries, and resolutely cracked down on all counter-revolutionary activities carried out by using religion. After the implementation of democratic reform, the People's Government provided appropriate subsidies to monasteries whose monks and nuns could not afford their living expenses. After this great revolutionary movement, the class consciousness of the masses of monks and nuns was raised, and they participated in the democratic management of the monasteries. Therefore, they felt comfortable, enthusiastic about learning, and asked to participate in labor and other social activities, and they arranged their own religious activities themselves. They truly and comprehensively realized that the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief was completely correct.

In terms of united front work at the upper level, since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Party and the upper-level figures in Tibet have established a broad united front. Because the upper-level reactionary group that attempted to split the unity of the motherland and undermine national unity had embarked on a path of self-destruction, the people's democratic united front in Tibet has become stronger. Due to the Party's unity and education, the redemption policy, and appropriate arrangements in politics and life (of which more than 500 upper and middle-level figures receive state salaries and living expenses), patriotic and progressive upper and middle-level figures actively supported democratic reform, comfortably carried out self-transformation, and were willing to contribute to the construction of a new socialist Tibet together with the working people.

Conscientiously implementing the mass line working method instructed by the Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, and fully mobilizing the masses is the key to successfully completing the task of democratic reform. We followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, believed in the masses in our work, relied on the masses, consulted with the masses on everything, and conscientiously implemented the "three togethers and one exchange" instruction put forward by the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, that is, whether Han Chinese or Tibetan workers, they must eat, live, and work together with the masses, and exchange hearts with the masses, extensively and deeply mobilized the masses, and led the masses to participate in the great democratic reform movement of liberating themselves. In all the areas undergoing reform, mass meetings to dig up the roots of poverty and tell of grievances were generally held. Serfs who had not had enough to eat or wear for generations and lived a life worse than cattle and horses stood up one after another to tell of the oppression and suffering they had suffered in the past, and burned with excitement and anger all kinds of contracts that had made them suffer exploitation and oppression for thousands of years. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Han Chinese and Tibetan workers, the broad masses of peasants and herdsmen, through the tempering of the reform struggle, established their own organizations - peasant (herdsmen) associations. For example, the Shannan Special District has established 290 peasant associations with more than 76,800 members; the Nagqu Special District has established 63 herdsmen associations with more than 30,000 members. In the democratic reform, the peasant (herdsmen) associations acted on behalf of the functions of grassroots political power, realized the slogan of "all rights belong to the peasant associations," and trained and cultivated a large number of activists. According to statistics from the three special districts of Lhasa, Shannan, and Nagqu, more than 46,800 activists from the working people emerged and were cultivated in the movement, and they have become the backbone force in the countryside for implementing the instructions of the Party and the People's Government at higher levels. Now, the power organs at the special district and county levels in the entire Tibet region have been established. The grassroots political power in the vast countryside will be gradually established through the upcoming democratic reform review movement.

The Tibetan people have gained rich fruits of struggle in this vigorous democratic revolution movement. The broad masses of serfs and slaves have gained complete liberation, distributed land and other means of production. In areas where land distribution has been completed, more than 2.1 million ke of land (one ke of land is equivalent to one mu) has been distributed to the peasants, with an average of 3.5 ke per person; due to the implementation of the policies of "whoever plants it harvests it," "reducing rent and interest," and abolishing old debts, the economic benefits obtained by the working people are equivalent to more than 1 billion jin of grain, with an average of more than 1,500 jin per person. Through the tempering of this great revolutionary struggle, the class consciousness of the broad peasant and herdsmen masses has been greatly improved. They said: "The sun of the Kashag (referring to the original Tibetan local government) shines on the three major landlords and their agents, and the sun of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao shines on us poor people." "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have made us the masters of the land." They enthusiastically praised: "Chairman Mao is the father of all ethnic groups in the motherland, even closer than our own parents. The Communist Party is truly for the people, and the Communist Party cadres are the cadres of our Tibetan people." They said: "The words spoken by the upper-level reactionaries are the same as ours, but their hearts are different from ours. The words spoken by the Han Chinese cadres are different from ours, but their hearts are the same as ours." The victory of democratic reform has filled the Tibetan people with confidence in their future. The great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland has made them even more yearning for a happy socialist life. In the months immediately following the end of the reform, they widely launched a upsurge in organizing mutual aid teams on a voluntary basis. In the four special districts of Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, and Xigaze, 4,741 mutual aid teams have been established, with more than 37,900 households participating in the mutual aid teams. In the Nyingchi Special District, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams accounts for 80% of the total number of households in the district. In the Shannan Special District, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams has reached 93% of the total number of households in the district.

The victory of democratic reform and the complete destruction of the serf system greatly liberated rural productive forces, and a vigorous high tide of striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year is rising. The broad masses of peasants are full of vigor, and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. Since last winter, the entire region has built a total of 3,000 canals, extending 3,000 li, repaired 300 reservoirs, and expanded the irrigated area by more than 370,000 ke. This has expanded the irrigated area of the entire region from the original 65% to 95%. In the Shannan Special District alone, approximately 4 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated, with an average of 17,000 jin of fertilizer applied per ke of land. At the same time, 33 chemical fertilizer plants have been established, producing more than 75,000 jin of chemical fertilizer. In many places, the cultivated land was plowed once at most in previous years. After the reform, more than 95% of the cultivated land in the entire region has been plowed once, of which 53% of the cultivated land has been plowed twice, and 28% of the cultivated land has been plowed three times. In the past, Tibet did not have a single piece of new-style agricultural equipment. A large number of new-style agricultural equipment allocated to Tibet by the central government in 1955 failed to be distributed due to the obstruction of the upper-level reactionary group. This year, these new-style agricultural equipment were distributed and were warmly welcomed by the peasant masses. The broad masses of peasants liberated their minds and actively improved old-style agricultural equipment. People broke the superstition that "women's farming does not yield good harvests," and this year many women have learned to farm.

The 1960 production targets proposed by the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region require agricultural areas to increase production by 15% to 20% on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. After enthusiastic discussions by the peasant masses, they generally raised it to 20% to 30%, and some places proposed to increase production by 40% to 50%, and some experimental fields and high-yield fields proposed a target of doubling production, and they all formulated production increase plans. At present, the production targets have been implemented to mutual aid teams, households, and fields. With the development of production, movements to talk about hygiene and learn culture have been successively launched. Many people-run primary schools and adult cultural schools and night schools have been opened in various places. Some areas have also built roads, carried out greening, and some cities and towns have also organized production and employment to resettle the old, weak, disabled. In pastoral areas, the broad masses of working herdsmen are conducting a resolute struggle against the severe cold of the plateau and other natural disasters with soaring energy. Under the leadership of the Party committees and people's governments at all levels and the herdsmen associations, they are actively repairing pens, storing grass, and making felt. In the Nagqu Special District alone, incomplete statistics show that more than 1.6 million jin of winter grass has been stored, 4,000 livestock pens have been built, and more than 40,000 pieces of felt have been made. In addition, many different disaster prevention tools have been manufactured. In areas where the "three antis and two benefits" movement has been realized, men and women have participated in various production increase movements with soaring energy, and are working hard to protect livestock and rapidly develop animal husbandry production. In short, in Tibet, whether it is agricultural areas, pastoral areas, or cities and towns, everywhere is full of a thriving new scene.

The above simple situation fully shows that the Tibetans and the people of Tibet have definitely embarked on a new stage of socialist rapid development and prosperity.

However, when we were suppressing the rebellion and carrying out democratic reform in Tibet, imperialists and foreign reactionaries clamored endlessly that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army wanted to eliminate the nationalities and religions of Tibet, demanding that we stop the struggle to quell the rebellion and democratic reform, which is not worth refuting. The movement to quell the rebellion and carry out democratic reform in Tibet is a struggle between the broad masses of the Tibetan people and a small group of reactionary serf owners. It is an irreconcilable class struggle, not a national struggle. The purpose of the reform is precisely to develop the politics, economy, culture, and population of the Tibetan nationality, to eradicate the oppression and exploitation system of religion, and to truly realize freedom of religious belief. Now, due to the victory of suppressing the rebellion and democratic reform, the Tibetan region has presented an unprecedented new and vibrant scene, and the Tibetan nationality has embarked on a new stage of national development and national prosperity, which more ruthlessly indicates how absurd and ridiculous the above clamor of imperialism and foreign reactionaries is. Imperialists and foreign reactionaries also clamor that "the basic human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people have been deprived" and demand "respect for the unique way of life of the Tibetan people," which is of course also very absurd and ridiculous.

Obviously, the basic human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people they are talking about specifically refer to the rights and freedoms of a small group of reactionary serf owners in Tibet to cruelly oppress serfs, exploit serfs, and slaughter serfs, and the unique way of life of the Tibetan people they are talking about refers to the barbaric and cannibalistic serf system. Their frantic clamoring is nothing more than an attempt to guarantee the rights and freedoms of the Tibetan serf owner class to kill and seize from the serf class, and nothing more than wanting us to never touch this extremely dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system in Tibet. Let them spread rumors and slander. The millions of serfs who originally had no basic human rights and freedoms have stood up, and they have crushed the serf system with their own hands, making themselves the masters of the new society and gaining true rights and freedoms as human beings. In the future, under the wise leadership of the Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the Tibetan people will surely further consolidate the unity of the motherland and strengthen national unity with their own actions, thoroughly complete democratic reform, vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, and work together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country to set high goals, establish great ambitions, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new socialist Tibet in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
