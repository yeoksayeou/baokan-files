Achievements and Tasks of Agricultural Science Research Work
Speech by Representative Ding Ying

Mr. Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the draft of the 1960 national budget, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. These reports summarized the great achievements of the comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward in China's national economy in 1959, further clarified that the 1960 industrial and agricultural development plan should be based on agriculture and led by industry, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture; and clearly pointed out that in order to promote the rapid development of agriculture, all departments such as industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, and health should regard supporting agriculture as their important task and specifically arrange the work of their departments to meet the requirements of this task. This gives the agricultural workers across the country the greatest encouragement and the confidence of victory in the battle on the agricultural science and agricultural production front. Now I will give a brief report to the representatives on the leap forward in the national agricultural scientific research work in 1959 and the leap forward plan for 1960.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the national agricultural scientific research work in 1959 was a year of continued leap forward.

National agricultural scientific research institutions have developed greatly. According to incomplete statistics at the end of 1959, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has established 34 national professional research institutes (sections), 157 provincial-level and above professional institutes, 190 prefectural-level research institutes, 771 county-level research institutes, and more than 7,690 research institutes or experimental stations (farms) at the people's commune level. An agricultural scientific research network based on the people's commune and covering the whole country has basically taken shape.

Significant achievements have also been made in agricultural scientific research in 1959. In order to explore the yield-increasing laws of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," systematically summarize the experience of large-scale high-yield crops, study and develop China's traditional intensive farming science and technology, create favorable conditions for agricultural mechanization, and continue to increase the yield per unit area, more than 2,000 people were drawn from research institutions above the provincial level to establish more than 670 rural base points, go deep into the communes to eat, live, and work with the peasants, cultivate experimental fields together, create large-scale high yields, and accumulate a large amount of scientific data, which played a significant role in guiding current production. According to the exploration in the past two years, relatively suitable deep plowing, heavy fertilization, and dense planting ranges have been found for major crops in different regions under the existing cultivation level. The soil survey and identification work over the past year has provided a scientific basis for a series of specific measures such as deep plowing according to soil type, planting according to soil type, fertilizing according to soil type, and transforming low-yield fields for planned production. The theory of thinning flowers and fruits in fruit tree cultivation has been negated, and the phenomenon of large and small harvests in fruit tree production has been replaced by the fact of continuous bumper harvests. Greater development has also been made in breeding work. A total of 1,270 improved varieties of crops have been selected and bred nationwide, more than four times the total number of varieties bred in the 20 years before liberation. Among them, in terms of distant hybridization of crops, such as rice hybridized with barnyard grass, corn, sorghum, and Job's tears, and cotton hybridized with hollyhocks, many new systems have been obtained; bold attempts have also been made in distant hybridization of livestock, such as cattle hybridized with pigs, pigs with sheep, wild sheep with Tibetan sheep, and cattle with yaks, and promising offspring have been initially obtained. New progress has also been made in the testing of several agricultural machinery tools, with the creation of rice transplanters and the promotion and finalization of 19 types; among them, the South 105B type transplanter, after vigorous improvement, can automatically deliver and separate seedlings, transplanting 20 to 25 mu per day, and increasing yield compared to manual transplanting; power rope tractors, peanut harvesters, potato harvesters, tea pickers, and simple ramie stripping machines have all achieved important results. Biogas liquefaction has been initially successfully tested in China. More than 230 kinds of soil pesticides have been measured by biological methods, which can effectively prevent and control 52 kinds of important diseases and insect pests that harm crops; endosorption fungicides have been preliminarily trial-produced. In terms of veterinary medicine, standard antigens and standard sera of foot-and-mouth disease type O, attenuated mouse poison vaccine of type O and attenuated rabbit poison vaccine of type ZB have been trial-manufactured and promoted, and safe and effective fowl cholera vaccine has been produced with an effect of 100%. Traditional Chinese veterinary acupuncture has extremely high curative effects for nine diseases such as pig asthma and lameness caused by sprains in horses and mules. In addition, since China's liberation, especially on the basis of the technical experience of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, we have organized national forces to compile cultivation studies on rice, wheat, cotton, fruit trees, and sericulture; theoretical works on livestock infectious diseases, plant protection, soil science, and fertilizer science, etc., a total of nine books, about five million words. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also actively compiled more than 280 kinds of scientific and technical books, totaling more than 26 million words. This is something that predecessors dared not imagine, thus changing the backward situation that there has not been a theoretical work that can truly reflect China's agricultural production experience in nearly a hundred years.

Since 1959, in agricultural scientific research, we have explored the following basic experiences:

(1) Adhere to putting politics in command, resolutely implement the set of two-legged walking guidelines stipulated by the Party's General Line, resolutely implement the mass line method of close combination of cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and the masses, and vigorously carry out mass movements.

(2) Scientific theory serves production, and academic research is driven by tasks. Research plans are determined and research projects are arranged according to production needs. Production seasons are seized to solve local urgent problems, and the level of theoretical research is improved on the basis of summarizing the masses' experience in high-yield production.

(3) For current urgent problems and some cutting-edge problems, the method of setting up multiple base points and carrying out experiments simultaneously with multiple methods has greatly accelerated the speed of scientific research. For example, in the work of selecting and breeding new varieties, the methods of professional, mass, indigenous, and foreign are adopted simultaneously, and planned systematic selection, variety hybridization, and distant hybridization are carried out, and many promising new varieties have been obtained, and great results have also been achieved in tool reform.

(4) Technical inspections are organized according to different growth and development stages of crops. Inspections are carried out from point to area for major crops, and problems are discovered and solved on the spot. For example, on-site meetings are held to study specific measures, or experiences are exchanged and promoted. This method has proven to be effective in the Great Leap Forward and has played a significant role in guiding current production.

(5) The method of combining research offices, experimental farms, and base points of people's communes is adopted. The experimental research of rural base points is closely related to the local production and the advanced experience of farmers, and is the vanguard of creating various high-yield crops by applying the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and is also a base for solving practical production problems. Research results can be quickly verified and promoted; widespread base points can provide more surface materials, and the materials revealed from multi-point experiments are summarized and analyzed by the research office, so that the objective laws of agricultural production and the theoretical basis of technical measures can be obtained as soon as possible.

(6) Vigorously carry out cooperation. The regionality of agricultural scientific research is very strong. Different regions have different problems, and the same problem has different solutions under different natural conditions. Especially with the increasing development of modern specialized science, and the research conditions and technical strength of various scientific research units are still unbalanced, it is necessary to take key tasks as the main body, and professional institutes as the core, and organize relevant departments to vigorously carry out cooperation; to achieve common discussion of topics, unified understanding, unified plans, unified pace, and establish a contact system to ensure the completion of the cooperation plan.

(7) Throughout the entire process of implementing the research plan, continuously strengthen political and ideological education, check and summarize in stages, so that projects are implemented and measures are reliable. The experience of the Great Leap Forward, in which research projects were completed more, faster, better, and more economically, proves that the leading organs must do a good job of grasping stage inspections, which can be grasped several times a year, to discover and solve problems in a timely manner; and according to needs and possibilities, adjust deployments, implement both enthusiasm and a truly solid research style, and at the same time, carry out political and ideological work in depth into research offices and experimental farms, or launch competitions and tribute movements to promote research work.

(8) Implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and hold various types of thematic seminars in a prepared manner. Whether it is a technical problem in production practice or a theoretical problem in agricultural science, carry out extensive discussions, express various scientific views, discern the direction of research and solution, and propose specific problems to be studied and solved in the future; if opinions are inconsistent, different practices can be allowed, and more in-depth research can be carried out separately to speed up the work process and improve research quality.

According to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, on the basis of the great victory in opposing rightism and encouraging enthusiasm, the agricultural production in 1960 will inevitably appear and has already appeared in a more powerful and magnificent leap forward upsurge. In order to accelerate the completion of China's agricultural technical transformation and achieve the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, agricultural science must be greatly developed, and comprehensive technical measures for implementing the agricultural "Eight-Point Charter" in different regions, different crops, and different conditions, as well as new problems that may be brought about by agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, must be studied. The main work tasks for 1960 are planned as follows:

	(1) Research work: Continue to summarize the experience of large-scale and small-scale high-yield production of food, cotton, oil, and other industrial raw materials, horticultural specialty crops, further explore the application laws of the "Eight-Point Charter," and create a complete set of scientific and technological measures, adopt systematic selection, variety hybridization, and distant hybridization to cultivate high-yielding and high-quality new varieties of crops; actively carry out research on agricultural mechanization and electrification, combined with China's excellent tradition of intensive farming, research and design the selection and finalization of agricultural machinery and tools suitable for dense planting, multiple cropping, and tall-stalk crops; take pig raising as the key link, comprehensively carry out research work on animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, apply artificial insemination technology, carry out distant hybridization of livestock and poultry, cultivate new varieties of livestock and poultry, especially new varieties with strong vitality and disease resistance; complete the national soil survey work mainly based on arable land, further study the agricultural soil fertility characteristics, the process of fertility development and improvement, and effective measures to accelerate soil ripening and promote crop root development. In addition, carry out research on the utilization of atomic energy in agriculture, explore the ways to increase production of new varieties and clarify the nutritional and physiological problems of crops under high-yield cultivation conditions.

	(2) Vigorously train new forces. In addition to supplementing forces from agricultural colleges according to national plans, various professional research institutions will do everything possible to run full-time or part-time higher or secondary technical schools and short-term training courses to meet the urgent needs of agricultural science development. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences plans to build an Agricultural Science and Technology University this year.

	(3) The cutting-edge and basic disciplines in the field of agricultural science are still weak; scientific research institutions, although developing rapidly, are still unbalanced. Therefore, on the existing basis, blank disciplines should be established in a planned and step-by-step manner, weak links should be supplemented, and research on cutting-edge and basic theories should be strengthened, so that agricultural science can quickly catch up with the international level.

	(4) Through successive political movements and the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the political awareness and academic thinking of researchers have undergone profound changes, and the viewpoint of serving agricultural production, following the mass line, and linking theory with practice has been basically established. This is the main aspect; but the bourgeois world outlook and idealistic academic viewpoints still exist to varying degrees, and will be reflected whenever suitable conditions are encountered. Therefore, in the future, we must systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, continuously fight against the right-leaning conservative bourgeois ideology and individualism in the agricultural science team, improve communist awareness, learn to use the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism to observe, analyze, and solve important problems in production and science, and creatively develop China's agricultural science.

The above is a request for the representatives to offer criticisms and corrections to our work results and development plans.

    农业科学研究工作的成就和任务
    丁颖代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）而斗争的报告。这几个报告总结了1959年我国国民经济全面继续大跃进的伟大成就，对1960年的工农业发展计划，进一步确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合；还明确指出，为了促进农业的迅速发展，工业、运输、商业、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各部门都要把支援农业当做自己的重要任务，并且适应这个任务的要求，具体安排本部门的工作。这就使全国的农业工作者在农业科学和农业生产战线上的战斗意志获得最大的鼓舞和必胜的信心。现在我把1959年全国农业科学研究工作的跃进情况和1960年的跃进规划向各位代表作简要汇报。
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，1959年的全国农业科学研究工作，是继续跃进的一年。
    全国农业科学研究机构有了很大发展。根据1959年年底的不完全统计，中国农业科学院已建立全国性的专业研究所（室）三十四个，省级以上专业所有一百五十七个，专区研究所一百九十个，县级研究所七百七十一个，人民公社级的研究所或试验站（场）七千六百九十多个。一个以人民公社为基础的遍及全国的农业科学研究网已经基本形成。
    1959年的农业科学研究工作也取得了显著的成就。为了探索农业“八字宪法”的增产规律，系统的总结农作物大面积丰产经验，研究发展我国传统的精耕细作的科学技术，创造农业机械化的有利条件，和继续提高单位面积的产量，全国省以上研究机关抽调了两千余人，建立了六百七十多个农村基点，深入公社与农民同吃、同住、同劳动，一道种试验田，创造大面积丰产，积累了大量的科学资料，对指导当前生产，起了很大作用。根据近两年的探索，找到了不同地区的主要作物在现有的耕作水平下，比较适宜的深耕多肥和密植幅度。一年来的土壤普查鉴定工作，已为因土深耕、因土种植、因土施肥，和改造低产田等一系列的具体措施，对计划生产提供了科学的根据。果树栽培上疏花疏果的理论已被否定，果树生产上大年、小年的现象已被连年丰产事实所代替。育种工作亦有了更大的发展，全国选育出农作物优良品种一千二百七十个，超过解放前二十多年的育成品种总数四倍还多，其中在农作物的远缘杂交方面，如水稻与稗草、玉米、高粱、薏苡杂交，棉花与锦葵杂交，获得了很多新的系统；在家畜远缘杂交方面，也进行了大胆的尝试，牛与猪杂交，猪与羊，野羊与藏羊，牛与牦牛杂交，已初步获得很有希望的后代。在几种农机具试验方面也取得了新的进展，创制成水稻插秧机，推广定型十九种；其中南一零五B型插秧机经大力改进后，已能自动送秧分秧，每天插秧二十到二十五亩，且比手插增产；电力绳索牵引机、花生收获机、薯类收获机、采茶机，简易剥麻机等都已取得重要成就。沼气液化已在国内初步试验成功。用生物测定出二百三十多种土农药，能有效防治危害作物的五十二类重要病虫；内吸杀菌剂已初步试制成功。兽医方面已试制出口蹄疫O型标准抗原与标准血清，O型鼠化弱毒疫苗及ZB型兔化弱毒疫苗，已生产推广，同时制成安全有效的家禽霍乱菌苗效果达百分之百。中兽医针灸治疗猪喘气病、马骡闪伤跛行等九种疾病疗效极高。此外从我国解放以来，特别是从农业生产大跃进的技术经验基础上，我们组织了全国力量，编写了水稻、小麦、棉花、果树、蚕桑等栽培学；家畜传染病学、植物保护学、土壤学、肥料学等九本理论著作，约五百万字，各省、市、自治区也分别积极编写了各种科学技术书籍二百八十多种，共达二千六百余万字，这是前人不敢设想的，从而改变了近百年来没有一本能真正反映我国农业生产经验的理论著作的落后面貌。
    1959年以来，在农业科学研究工作上，我们摸索到以下的基本经验：
    （一）坚持政治挂帅，坚决贯彻党的总路线所规定的一整套两条腿走路的方针，坚决贯彻执行干部、科学技术人员和群众紧密结合的群众路线方法，大搞群众运动。
    （二）科学理论为生产服务，以任务带动学术研究。针对生产需要，决定研究计划，安排研究项目，抓住生产季节，解决当地迫切问题，并在总结群众丰产经验的基础上，提高理论研究水平。
    （三）对当前迫切问题以及若干尖端问题，采取多设基点、多种方法齐头进行试验的办法，大大加快了科学研究的速度。如在选育新品种工作上采取了专业的、群众的，土的、洋的同时并举方法，进行有计划的系统选种、品种杂交和远缘杂交，获得了许多有希望的新品种，还在工具改革等方面收到很大成效。
    （四）根据作物不同的生长发育阶段，组织技术考察。对主要作物由点到面进行考察，发现问题，就地汇综解决。如召开现场会议研究具体措施，或交流推广经验，这种方法在大跃进中证明是行之有效的，对指导当前生产作用很大。
    （五）采取研究室、试验场与人民公社的基点相结合的方法。农村基点的试验研究是与当地的生产和农民的先进经验紧密联系着的，是应用“八字宪法”创造各种作物高额丰产的尖兵，又是解决生产实际问题的基地，研究成果易于迅速验证和推广；广布基点可提供更多的面的材料，从多点试验揭示出来的材料中，由研究室加以总结和分析研究，就可以尽快得出农业生产的客观规律和技术措施的理论根据。
    （六）大搞协作。农业科学研究的地域性很强，不同地区有着不同的问题，而同一问题在不同的自然条件下又有不同的解决途径；尤其是现代的专门科学日益发展，而各科学研究单位的研究条件和技术力量还不平衡，因此需要以重点任务为主体，专业所为核心，组织有关部门大搞协作；做到课题共同讨论，认识统一，计划统一，步调统一，建立联系制度，保证协作计划的完成。
    （七）在执行研究计划全过程中，不断加强政治思想教育，分阶段检查总结，使项目落实，措施可靠。在大跃进中，研究项目完成的又多又快又好的经验证明，领导机关要很好的抓阶段检查，一年可以抓几次，及时发现问题，解决问题；并根据需要和可能，调整部署，贯彻既有干劲，又有切切实实的研究作风，同时把政治思想工作深入到研究室试验场中去，或展开竞赛和献礼运动来推动研究工作。
    （八）贯彻执行百花齐放，百家争鸣的方针，有准备的召开各种类型的专题讨论会，不论是生产实践中的技术问题，或者是农业科学中的理论问题，开展广泛讨论，可发表各个不同的科学见解，辨别研究解决的方向，提出今后研究解决的具体问题；如果意见不一致，可以允许不同的作法，分途进行更深入的研究，以加快工作进程，提高研究质量。
    根据八届八中全会的精神，在反右倾、鼓干劲取得伟大胜利的基础上，1960年农业生产必将出现而且已经出现了声势更大、规模宏伟的跃进高潮。为了加速完成我国农业技术改造和提前实现农业发展纲要四十条，要大大发展农业科学，研究在不同地区、不同作物、不同条件下，贯彻农业“八字宪法”的综合技术措施，以及农业机械化、水利化、电气化可能带来的新问题。特将1960年主要的工作任务规划如下：
      （一）研究工作方面：继续总结粮、棉、油和其他工业原料、园艺特产各类作物的大面积和小面积高额丰产经验，进一步探求“八字宪法”的应用规律，作成整套的科学技术措施，采用系统选种、品种杂交和远缘杂交培育高产优质的农作物新品种；积极进行农业机械化、电气化的研究，结合我国精耕细作的优良传统，研究设计适合密植复种和高秆作物的农机具的选择定型工作；以养猪为纲，全面开展畜牧兽医的研究工作，应用人工授精技术，进行畜禽远缘杂交，培育畜禽新品种，特别是培育生活力和抗病力强的新品种；完成全国以耕地为主的土壤普查工作，进一步研究农业土壤肥力特性、肥力发展过程和提高肥力，加速土壤熟化和促进作物根系发育的有效措施。此外，开展原子能在农业上利用的研究，探求新品种的增产途径和阐明作物在丰产栽培条件下的营养生理问题。
      （二）大力培养新生力量。除由农业院校按国家计划补充力量外，各专业研究机关将尽一切可能开办全日制或半日制高等或中等技术学校和短期训练班等，以满足农业科学发展的急需。中国农业科学院拟今年筹建一所农业科学技术大学。
      （三）农业科学领域内的尖端和基础学科，还有薄弱的环节；科学研究机构，虽然发展很快，但尚不平衡。因此，应在现有基础上有计划有步骤的建立空白学科，充实薄弱环节，加强尖端和基础理论的研究，使农业科学迅速赶上国际水平。
      （四）通过历次政治运动，农业生产大跃进，使研究人员的政治觉悟和学术思想，获得了深刻的变化，基本上树立了为农业生产服务，走群众路线，理论联系实际的观点，这是主要的方面；但资产阶级的世界观和唯心主义的学术观点，仍不同程度的存在着，一遇适宜条件，就反映出来。因此，今后必须系统学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，不断同农业科学队伍中右倾保守的资产阶级思想和个人主义进行斗争，提高共产主义觉悟，学习运用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，观察分析，解决生产上和科学上的重要问题，创造性地发展我国农业科学。
    以上谨请代表们对我们的工作成果和进展规划提出批评和指正。
