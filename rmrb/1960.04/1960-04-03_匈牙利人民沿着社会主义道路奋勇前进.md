    The Hungarian People Forge Ahead Vigorously Along the Socialist Road

    The Great Spring Festival
    The sunshine of the first spring in the 1960s shines on the "Pearl of the Danube" - the capital of the Hungarian People's Republic, Budapest. This heroic and beautiful city is dressed in gorgeous festive costumes in this socialist spring. People are using their tense labor and infinite joy to welcome the great festival of the 15th anniversary of the motherland's liberation.
    Rákóczi Avenue (a street named after the Hungarian national hero), which was severely damaged by the counter-revolutionary riots instigated by imperialism three and a half years ago, has been rebuilt and looks even more magnificent today, with the red, white, and green national flags fluttering in the wind. On Dósa Square, which symbolizes the heroic tradition of the Hungarian people, a huge reviewing stand and grandstand that can accommodate 50,000 people have been built. On the day of the festival, a grand military parade will be held on the square. A large banner with the words "Long Live the 15th Anniversary of Liberation, 1945-1960" hangs high in front of the Orion factory in the capital. The factory workers will dedicate their labor achievements to the motherland's liberation festival, and the farmers of the agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of the capital are also busy with spring plowing and sowing before the festival.
    In the past fifteen years, especially in the past three years since the 1956 October counter-revolutionary riots, the Hungarian people, under the correct leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, have taken heroic steps and forged ahead vigorously along the bright road of socialism, achieving glorious victories. The counter-revolutionary riots in October 1956 caused major losses of 22 billion forints (Hungarian currency) and unprecedented economic difficulties. However, with the selfless labor of the heroic people and the strong assistance of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, the national economy had basically recovered by the end of 1957. Industrial production had increased significantly compared with 1956, and even increased by 6% compared with 1955 before the counter-revolutionary riots. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party summarized the experience of twelve years of economic construction, established the policy of self-reliance in developing the national economy, and formulated a three-year plan (1958-1960) for developing the national economy. Thanks to the Party's correct economic policies and the increase in the political consciousness of the working people, the main indicators for 1960 had been completed one year ahead of schedule by 1959. The three-year plan required that industrial production by 1960 increase by 22% compared with 1957, but it had already increased by 24% in 1959; the three-year plan required that agricultural production increase by 12% by 1960, but it had already increased by 13% in 1959; labor productivity approached the 1960 target; production costs decreased by 2% more than the original plan; and the actual income of employees increased by 11%, exceeding the original plan by 5%. The socialist transformation of agriculture has also achieved amazing and extremely great achievements.

    Labor Competition is in Full Swing
    After entering 1960, the Hungarian working class, in order to welcome the 15th anniversary of liberation, launched a more surging upsurge of socialist labor competition, with 39,000 labor teams participating in this competition. They resolutely responded to the call of the Party's Seventh Congress to accelerate socialist construction, and presented their rich fruits to their festival. The Lenin Metallurgical United Enterprise overproduced 4,000 tons of metallurgical products beyond the plan in the first two days of this year. By mid-February, it had overproduced 5,000 tons of steel and other metallurgical products worth 12 million forints (Hungarian currency name). The workers in the Komló mining area decided to overproduce more than 30,000 tons of high-quality coal this year, saving 6 million forints. The steel workers of the newly built Danube Iron and Steel Plant decided to increase the production of iron by 110,000 tons and steel by 100,000 tons this year compared with last year, and ensure that the hot-rolled steel workshop is put into production ahead of schedule. The young construction workers of Stalin City put forward the slogan of "Ten-Day Movement" in the competition for the honorary title of "Socialist Labor Team", striving to complete each construction project at least ten days ahead of schedule.

    In the hot labor competition, the flowers of technological innovation bloomed everywhere. In 1959, employees across the country put forward a total of 250,000 technological innovation proposals and inventions with great economic value. The economic value of the adopted technological innovation proposals exceeded 3 billion forints. The famous Csepel Iron and Steel Plant adopted 1,640 technological innovation proposals in 1959 alone, one of which increased the perforation efficiency during steel pipe rolling by nearly 60 times. This year, in the socialist labor competition to welcome the 15th anniversary of the motherland's liberation, mass technological innovation activities have become more popular and in-depth. Enterprises under the metallurgical and machinery manufacturing industries decided to save 810 million forints of funds for the festival of the motherland's liberation through technological innovation. The Budapest United Bulb Factory put forward more than 100 innovation proposals in the first ten days of the "Innovation Month" to welcome the festival. After one of the innovation proposals is put into production, it can save 210,000 cubic meters of gas for the motherland every year.

    At present, 12,000 labor teams across the country are participating in the competition for the honorary title of "Socialist Labor Team", and one-fourth of the labor teams have won this honorary title. In the competition, the workers greatly promoted the communist style of selfless labor of mutual assistance and cooperation. Veteran workers enthusiastically passed on technology to young workers, and advanced producers helped backward workers to catch up with themselves quickly. Construction enterprises, iron foundries, and machine factories in Nógrád closely cooperated and supported each other, ensuring that a new glass factory in the state was put into production greatly ahead of schedule. Technicians and workers in porcelain factories launched a large-scale cooperation to jointly transform unusable old machine tools into new cutting machine tools. After this machine tool is put into production, it can increase the production of high-voltage porcelain insulators by three times compared with the past and improve the quality of insulators.

    The Tide of Cooperation is Rising Higher and Higher
    The hardworking and brave Hungarian farmers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee Plenary Session in December 1958, resolutely moving forward rapidly along the bright road of socialism. After the two upsurges of agricultural cooperation in the winter and spring of 1958-1959 and 1959-1960, by the end of February 1960, 74% of the villages and towns across the country had fully realized cooperation. The cultivated land area of state-owned farms and cooperatives has reached 72% of the country's cultivated land area. Now, on the vast green fields, there are very few boundaries of the remnants of the small-scale peasant economy. Agricultural workers in state-owned farms and new and old members of agricultural cooperatives are enthusiastically carrying out collective production, and they are using tense labor to create a greater harvest this year.

    The working farmers of socialist Hungary remember the dark days of the October 1956 counter-revolutionary riots. At that time, rich peasants and other old exploiting class elements colluded with counter-revolutionary elements at home and abroad, destroying and forcibly disbanding cooperative groups and cooperatives, which were collective organizations for farmers to change from poor to rich, from today's wealth to a more beautiful and happier life, during the counter-revolutionary riots. At that time, many working farmers who resolutely took the socialist road resisted this countercurrent, and more than one-third of the cooperative groups and cooperatives persisted through the difficult days. By the end of 1956, there were 2,089 cooperative groups and cooperatives, with 120,000 members. The cultivated land accounted for 8.5% of the country's cultivated land area. These more than 2,000 cooperative groups and cooperatives have been consolidated and developed politically, economically, and organizationally. In 1958, the average yield per unit area of grain was about 20% higher than that of individual farmers. Animal husbandry developed faster, with cattle increasing by 57%, pigs by 33%, and sheep by 28% in one year. The average annual milk production per dairy cow increased from 1,453 liters in 1957 to 1,911 liters. In this year, the amount of meat sold by cooperatives to the state increased by 108% compared with the previous year, and milk increased by 85%. These vivid facts educated individual small farmers to take the road of agricultural cooperation, which led to the first upsurge of agricultural cooperation from the winter of that year to the spring of 1959.

    Although Hungary's agricultural production suffered severe drought in 1959, it won the harvest of "Man will conquer nature" under the collective labor of "Organizing means great strength". Agricultural production in this year exceeded the original plan by 2%, and the yield per unit area of wheat increased by 36% compared with 1958, and was 9% higher than the bumper harvest of 1957. What made the socialist working farmers particularly excited was that the yield per unit area of wheat in agricultural cooperatives was 28% higher than that of individual farmers. This further vividly proved the superiority of agricultural cooperation, attracting the hesitant middle peasants to the second upsurge of agricultural cooperation in the winter and spring of 1959-1960.

    Now the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is vigorously consolidating the newly developed agricultural cooperatives. The state provides strong support to agricultural cooperatives in terms of finance and economy. After the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the winter and spring of 1958-1959, the Party launched a mass movement to consolidate the new cooperatives throughout the country. In the past year, the Party Central Committee and local Party organizations dispatched about 6,000 political and technical cadres to agricultural cooperatives to take up work and strengthen the leadership of the new cooperatives. This year, the Party and the government decided to transfer 1,200 agricultural talents from central agricultural departments, agricultural research institutes, and universities to work in newly established agricultural cooperatives for one year. Party organizations, mass organizations, factories and enterprises, and state-owned farms across the country have all undertaken the work of regularly assisting the new cooperatives. The workers in the agricultural machinery manufacturing sector generally increased production and saved money, rushed to produce agricultural machinery in the socialist labor competition, and vigorously supported the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    Although Hungary's agricultural cooperation movement has gone through a relatively long and tortuous road, because the Socialist Workers' Party has accepted the past experiences and lessons, carried out a resolute struggle against revisionist viewpoints, and adopted correct policies and measures, mobilized the masses, and rapidly promoted the healthy development of the agricultural cooperation movement, it has further liberated agricultural productive forces and powerfully promoted the development of industrial production. The contradiction between socialist large-scale industry and small-scale peasant economy has narrowed, the worker-peasant alliance has been strengthened, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has been further consolidated. This is another major glorious victory of the domestic socialist revolution of the Hungarian people after smashing the counter-revolutionary riots. Rural cadres are full of confidence, the broad masses of farmers are enthusiastic, and the completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture in Hungary is just around the corner.

    Victory on the Ideological Front
    Like the great victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the heroic Hungarian people have also achieved major victories on the ideological front. For more than three years, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has led the opposition to revisionism, the theory of the petty-bourgeois "third road", the Hungarian populism that permeated anti-worker and anti-socialist sentiments, and criticized Lukács's modern revisionist views in politics, philosophy, and aesthetics. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party attaches great importance to the ideological transformation of bourgeois intellectuals and vigorously promotes socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields.

    The victories of Hungary on the political, economic, and ideological fronts have developed the literature and art of the real people. New literary works and dramas and films with modern themes have emerged. Berkes András's novels "October Storm" and "After the Storm", Fábián István's play "Blinded Eyes", and the films "Yesterday" and "Dawn" depicting the counter-revolutionary riots in 1956 have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people. As Karoly Gyula, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Party Central Committee, said at the Party's Seventh Congress: "For artists, there is no more beautiful and noble task than to depict this era and to assist socialism in winning victory with their creations." Recently, Hungarian writers, actors, artists, and other literary and art workers have gone to the countryside and factories. On the one hand, they are in touch with reality, familiar with life, and learning from workers and peasants; on the other hand, they are performing for workers and peasants and assisting factories and rural areas in carrying out mass cultural and recreational activities. Artists create portraits of workers and peasant heroes and hold art exhibitions in factories. In this way, literary and art workers will be able to further transform their thinking and improve their artistic level, and better serve proletarian politics and socialist construction.

    Stepping into the Sixteenth Year
    The heroic Hungarian people, under the correct leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Comrade Kadar, will step into the sixteenth year along the bright road of socialism. In the past fifteen years, although they have taken a tortuous road and suffered serious damage from counter-revolutionary riots, brilliant achievements have been recorded in the great history of the Hungarian socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    The old Hungary under the rule of the reactionary classes was a poor country once called "three million beggars". But with the support and assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Hungarian people were liberated from the ravages of the German fascist army on April 4, 1945, smashed the armed counter-revolutionary riots in November 1956, and after arduous struggle, have transformed from an underdeveloped agricultural country into a socialist country with a fairly developed industrialization. The achievements of the Hungarian people are also the achievements of the entire socialist camp. The brothers in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are closely concerned about the further victory of the Hungarian people's agricultural socialist transformation and socialist construction. The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has already presented a magnificent picture of the Second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) to the heroic people. The plan requires that industrial production by 1965 increase by at least 65% to 70% compared with 1958, agricultural production increase by 30% to 32%, and national income increase by 50%. The realization of these great goals means that socialist relations of production will achieve the final victory in all fields of the Hungarian national economy.

    Fifteen years is only an instant in history, and the heroic, fighting Hungarian people with a glorious revolutionary tradition have written a brilliant history. The workers of the People's Capital Csepel Iron and Steel Plant will forever sing the poems of the 1919 proletarian revolution, praising the realization of their great ideals:

    Worker brothers, see clearly, see clearly!
    Capitalists are greedy.
    How tragic is the fate of the laborers,
    One-third of the country's residents are starving,
    Hunger and filth will devour you.
    But the decadent system is destined to collapse.
    They put military tribunals around your necks,
    Only despicable traitors applaud them.
    Red Csepel, let your voice be louder,
    Váci Street is responding to you!
    The flames of struggle have been burning on the banks of the Danube,
    And the vast Alföld Plain,
    Let your slogans resound in all directions.
    We will never starve to death,
    We can no longer endure,
    Red Csepel, rise up to lead the struggle!
    We want bread! We want labor!
    Brothers must know,
    Someone is provoking a new war!
    Quickly take up your weapons,
    If anyone dares to oppose the Soviets, then send your
      officers to hell and turn your guns on them!
    Let the capitalist system be completely destroyed.
    The flames of struggle will create a new world,
    The state of the working people, the Soviets!

    匈牙利人民沿着社会主义道路奋勇前进
    海棱　萧风
    伟大的春天的节日
    六十年代第一个春天的阳光，照耀着“多瑙河上的明珠”——匈牙利人民共和国的首都布达佩斯，这个英雄的美丽的城市，在这社会主义的春天里，穿上了绚丽的节日的盛装。人们正在用紧张的劳动和无限的欢乐来迎接祖国解放十五周年的伟大节日。
    三年半以前遭受帝国主义所策动的反革命暴乱，严重破坏的拉科奇大街（这是一条以匈牙利民族英雄命名的大街）早已建设一新，今天显得更加宏伟壮丽，红白绿三色国旗迎风招展。在象征着匈牙利人民英雄传统的多热广场上，已经修好了可以容纳五万人的巨大的检阅台和观礼台，在节日的当天，广场上将要举行盛大的阅兵大典。首都奥里翁工厂门前高悬着“1945—1960年解放十五周年万岁”的大幅字标。全厂工人要用自己的劳动业绩献给祖国的解放节日，首都郊区农业合作社的农民们，也在节日前紧张地进行着春耕春播。
    匈牙利人民十五年来特别是最近三年以来，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的正确领导下，迈着英雄的步伐，沿着社会主义的光明大道奋勇前进，取得了光辉的胜利。1956年十月反革命暴乱造成了二百二十亿福林（匈币）的重大损失，引起了经济上前所未有的困难。但是在英雄人民忘我劳动和以苏联为首的兄弟国家的大力援助下，国民经济到1957年底已经基本恢复，工业生产比1956年有了较大的增长，甚至比反革命暴乱前的1955年提高了6％。匈牙利社会主义工人党总结了十二年经济建设的经验，确立了发展国民经济自力更生的方针，制订了发展国民经济的三年计划（1958—1960年）。由于党的正确的经济政策和劳动人民政治觉悟的提高，到1959年已经提前一年完成1960年的各项主要指标。三年计划要求到1960年的工业生产比1957年提高22％，但是1959年已经增长了24％；三年计划要求到1960年农业生产提高12％，但是1959年已经增长了13％；劳动生产率接近了1960年指标；生产成本比原计划多降低了2％；职工实际收入增长了11％，比原订计划超过5％。农业的社会主义改造也取得了惊人的极其伟大的成就。
    劳动竞赛热火朝天
    在进入1960年之后，匈牙利工人阶级为了迎接解放十五周年，掀起了更加高涨的社会主义劳动竞赛的热潮，有三万九千个劳动队参加了这一竞赛。他们坚决响应党的第七次代表大会提出的加速建设社会主义的号召，用丰硕的果实向自己的节日献礼。列宁冶金联合企业在今年的头两天就超计划多生产了四千吨冶金产品，到2月中已经超计划增产了五千吨钢和价值达一千二百万福林（匈币名）的其他冶金产品。科姆洛矿区的工人们决定要在今年超额增产三万多吨优质煤，节约六百万福林。新建的多瑙钢铁厂的钢铁工人决定今年要比去年增产十一万吨铁和十万吨钢，并保证使热轧钢车间提前投入生产。年轻的斯大林城的建筑工人们在争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的竞赛中，提出了“十天运动”的口号，争取每一建筑工程至少提前十天完成。
    在热火朝天的劳动竞赛中技术革新的花朵遍地开放。1959年全国职工一共提出了二十五万项经济价值很大的技术革新建议和创造发明，其中经过采用的技术革新建议的经济价值超过了三十亿福林。著名的切佩尔钢铁厂，1959年一年中采用了一千六百四十项技术革新建议，其中一项使轧钢管时的穿孔效率提高了将近六十倍。今年在迎接祖国解放十五周年的社会主义劳动竞赛中，群众性的技术革新活动更加普及和深入。冶金和机器制造工业部门所属各企业，决定通过技术革新，为祖国解放的节日节约八亿一千万福林的资金。布达佩斯联合灯泡厂，在迎接节日的“革新月”中，头十天已经提出了一百多项革新建议，其中一项革新建议投入生产以后，每年可以为祖国节约二十一万立方米的煤气。
    目前全国有一万二千个劳动队参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的竞赛，其中有四分之一的劳动队已取得了这个光荣称号。在竞赛中，工人们大大发扬了互相帮助、互相协作的忘我劳动的共产主义的风格。老工人热情地向青年工人传授技术，先进生产者帮助后进的工人们迅速赶上自己。诺格拉德的建筑企业、铸铁厂和机器厂密切合作，互相支援，保证了这个州的一个新建玻璃厂大大地提前投入生产。瓷器厂的技术员和工人们展开了大合作，共同把不能用的陈旧机床改造成了新型的切削机床。这种机床投入生产后，可以使高电压的瓷绝缘体的生产比过去提高三倍，并改善了绝缘体质量。
    合作化春潮逐浪高
    勤劳勇敢的匈牙利农民，热烈响应匈牙利社会主义工人党1958年12月中央全会的号召，坚决地沿着社会主义的光明大道迅速前进。经过1958—1959年和1959—1960年两个冬春的农业合作化高潮，到1960年2月底止，全国已经有74％的村镇全部实现了合作化。国营农场和合作社的耕地面积已经达到全国耕地面积的72％。现在，在广阔的绿色的田野上，小农经济残迹的地界已经很少了。国营农场的农业工人和农业合作社的新老社员们热情地进行着集体的生产，他们正在用紧张的劳动创造今年的更大丰收。
    社会主义匈牙利的劳动农民，记忆着1956年十月反革命暴乱的黑暗日子。那时，富农及其他旧的剥削阶级分子，同国内外反革命分子纠集在一起，在反革命暴乱中破坏和强迫解散农民们的由穷变富、由今天的富裕达到明天更加美好幸福生活的集体组织的合作组和合作社。当时，许多坚决走社会主义道路的劳动农民抵抗了这股逆流，有三分之一以上的合作组和合作社在艰难的日子里坚持下来了。到1956年底，合作组和合作社共有二千零八十九个，社员十二万人。耕地占全国耕地面积的8.5％。这两千多个合作组和合作社，在政治、经济和组织上得到了巩固和发展。1958年谷物的单位面积产量平均较个体农民高20％左右。畜牧业的发展更快，一年中牛增长57％，猪增长33％，羊增长28％。每头奶牛每年的平均产奶量由1957年的一千四百五十三立升增加到一千九百一十一立升。这一年合作社出售给国家的肉类比前一年增加了108％，牛奶增加了85％。这些鲜明的事实教育了个体小农奔向农业合作化的道路，这就导致了这年冬天到1959年春天的第一次农业合作化高潮。
    1959年匈牙利的农业生产虽然遭受到严重的干旱，但是，在“组织起来力量大”的集体劳动下，赢得了“人定胜天”的丰收。这一年的农业生产超过了原订计划的2％，小麦的单位面积产量比1958年增产了36％，比大丰收的1957年高出9％。特别使社会主义劳动农民感到兴奋的是，农业合作社的小麦单位面积产量比个体农民高出28％。这就进一步生动地证明了农业合作化的优越性，吸引着徘徊犹豫的中农们投向了1959—1960年冬春的第二个农业合作化高潮。
    现在匈牙利社会主义工人党正在大力巩固新发展的农业合作社。国家在财政经济上给予农业合作社以大力支持。1958—1959年冬春农业合作化运动大发展后，党在全国各地普遍展开了一个巩固新社的群众性运动。在去年一年中，党中央和各地党组织派遣了约六千名政治和技术干部到农业合作社去担任工作，加强新社的领导力量。今年党和政府又决定从中央农业部门、农业研究所和高等学校等单位调派一千二百名农业人材到刚成立的农业合作社去工作一年。全国的党组织、群众团体、工厂企业和国营农场，都分别承担了经常协助新社的工作。农业机器制造部门的工人们普遍增产节约，在社会主义劳动竞赛中赶制农业机械，大力支持农业的社会主义改造。
    匈牙利的农业合作化运动虽然经过了比较长期的曲折道路，但由于社会主义工人党接受了过去的经验教训，同修正主义观点作了坚决的斗争，并采取了正确的政策和措施，发动了群众，迅速地推进了农业合作化运动的健康发展，从而进一步解放了农业生产力，有力地促进了工业生产的发展。社会主义的大工业和小农经济之间的矛盾缩小了，工农联盟加强了，无产阶级的专政也进一步巩固了。这是匈牙利人民在粉碎反革命暴乱后国内社会主义革命的又一次重大的光辉胜利。农村干部信心百倍，广大农民热情高涨，匈牙利农业社会主义改造的完成是指日可待了。
    思想战线上的胜利
    同农业的社会主义改造的巨大胜利一样，匈牙利社会主义工人党和英雄的匈牙利人民，在思想战线上也取得了重大的胜利。三年多来，匈牙利社会主义工人党领导了反对修正主义、小资产阶级“第三条道路”的理论，反对了渗透反工人和反社会主义情绪的匈牙利民粹主义，而且批判了卢卡奇在政治、哲学、美学方面的现代修正主义观点。匈牙利社会主义工人党十分重视资产阶级知识分子的思想改造，大力推动思想和文化领域中的社会主义革命工作。
    匈牙利在政治、经济、思想各条战线上的胜利，使真正的人民的文学艺术发展了。新的文学作品和现代题材的戏剧电影涌现了出来。贝尔柯什·昂德拉什的长篇小说“十月暴风雨”和“暴风雨之后”、费耶尔·伊斯特万的剧本“被蒙蔽的眼睛”、描写1956年反革命暴乱的电影“昨天”和“黎明”等优秀的作品，受到了广大人民的热烈欢迎。正如匈牙利党中央政治局委员卡拉伊·久洛在党的第七次代表大会上所说的：“对于艺术家来说，再也没有比描绘这个时代并以他们的创作来协助社会主义取得胜利更美好更崇高的任务了”。最近匈牙利的作家、演员、美术家和其他文艺工作者纷纷下乡下厂，他们一方面接触实际，熟悉生活，向工农学习；另一方面，又为工农演出，协助工厂农村开展群众文娱活动。美术家则创作工人农民英雄的画像，并且在工厂举办画展。这样，文艺工作者将能进一步改造自己的思想和提高艺术水平，更好地为无产阶级的政治服务，为社会主义建设服务。
    跨进第十六个年头
    英雄的匈牙利人民，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和卡达尔同志的正确领导下，将沿着社会主义的光明大道跨进第十六个年头。在过去十五年中，虽然走着曲折的道路，并且遭受了反革命暴乱的严重破坏，但是光辉灿烂的成就已经载入了匈牙利社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大史册。
    在反动阶级统治下的旧的匈牙利，是曾经被称为有“三百万乞丐”的穷国。但是匈牙利人民在伟大苏联的支持和援助下，1945年4月4日从德国法西斯军队的蹂躏下解放出来，1956年11月粉碎了反革命的武装暴乱，经过艰苦奋斗，已经从一个不发达的农业国家转变成了一个具有相当发达的工业化社会主义国家。匈牙利人民的成就也是整个社会主义阵营的成就。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的弟兄们，正在亲切地关心着匈牙利人民的农业社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的更进一步的胜利。匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会，已经向英雄的人民提出了第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）的宏伟图景。计划要求到1965年的工业生产至少比1958年提高65％到70％，农业生产提高30％到32％，国民收入增长50％。这些伟大指标的实现，意味着社会主义生产关系在匈牙利国民经济的所有领域中取得最终的胜利。
    十五年不过是历史上的一瞬间，而英雄的战斗的具有光荣革命传统的匈牙利人民，已经写下了光辉的史迹。人民首都切佩尔钢铁厂的工人们，永远用1919年无产阶级革命的诗歌，歌颂着他们的伟大理想的实现：
    工人兄弟，看清吧，看清吧！
    资本家是贪得无厌的。
    劳动者的命运是多么悲惨，
    全国居民的三分之一在挨饿，
    饥饿和污秽将把你吞噬。
    但是腐朽的制度已注定要崩溃。
    他们把军事法庭套在你的脖子上，
    为他们喝采的只有卑鄙的叛徒。
    红色切佩尔，让你的声音更响亮些，
    瓦兹街在响应你！
    斗争的火焰已燃烧在多瑙河畔，
    和辽阔的阿尔斐德平原，
    让你们的口号响彻四方。
    我们决不愿饿死，
    我们决不能再忍耐下去，
    红色的切佩尔，起来领导斗争！
    要面包！要劳动！
    兄弟们要知道，
    有人在挑拨新的战争！
    把你的武器快拿到手里，
    如果有人竟敢反对苏维埃，那么就把你的
      长官送入地狱，把你的枪口转向他们！
    让资本主义制度彻底毁灭。
    斗争的火焰将创建新的世界，
    劳动人民的国家，苏维埃！
