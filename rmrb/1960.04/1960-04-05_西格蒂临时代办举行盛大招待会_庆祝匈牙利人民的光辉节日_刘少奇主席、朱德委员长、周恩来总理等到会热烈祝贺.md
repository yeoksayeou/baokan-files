Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Szigeti, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Hungarian People's Republic in China, held a grand reception tonight to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai, among others, attended this grand reception.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the reception (full text on page 4). He first warmly congratulated the Hungarian people on the 15th anniversary of their liberation and congratulated them on the great achievements they have made in socialist construction over the past fifteen years.

Premier Zhou said: Socialist Hungary is an important factor for international peace, a loyal member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and a strong force in the international communist movement. For the past fifteen years, the Hungarian people have unswervingly waged a resolute struggle to safeguard peace, strengthen the solidarity of the socialist camp, oppose modern revisionism, and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and have made significant contributions.

Premier Zhou concluded: The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people, forged on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, is eternal and unbreakable. We firmly believe that the increasingly close cooperation between our two peoples will further promote the common upsurge of our cause.

Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Szigeti spoke at the beginning of the reception (full text on page 4). He said that their country has established a developed industry and laid the foundation for a modern agriculture. These achievements have been made by the hardworking people of our country, under the leadership of our Party, which implements correct and completely Marxist-Leninist policies, and with the fraternal assistance of our friends.

Szigeti said that socialist ideas have long existed among the Hungarian people and have taken deep root. He spoke of the counter-revolutionary events orchestrated by the imperialists in 1956 and the victory of the Hungarian people in suppressing the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion. He said that we can say with certainty that any future attempts at imperialist provocation and interference against our country, no matter what form they take or what international organizations they use, are doomed to fail.

Szigeti said that the people of our country highly value the fraternal relationship formed between the Hungarian and Chinese people over the past decade. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, one of the leaders of the great Chinese people, is scheduled to visit Hungary, and the Hungarian people are joyfully looking forward to his visit. The working people of our country are very concerned about the Chinese people's world-historically significant and large-scale construction work, as well as the unprecedented victories and achievements made in the Great Leap Forward and in the People's Communes.

Szigeti said that the people of our country wholeheartedly support the government of the People's Republic of China in its efforts to deepen good-neighborly relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and to ease international tensions.

Szigeti said that the people of our country are determined to do everything possible to strengthen cooperation with its true friends, with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to strengthen the unity and consolidation of this camp, to wholeheartedly support the struggle of all peoples who are still suffering from colonial oppression for independence, and to fight for peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Szigeti's speeches were warmly welcomed. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of China and Hungary respectively.

Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi raised his glass at the reception and proposed a toast:
