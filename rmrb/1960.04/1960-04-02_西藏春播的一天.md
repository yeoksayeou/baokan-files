A Day of Spring Planting in Tibet
Xinhua News Agency Tibet Branch Reporter, Tibet Daily Reporter Collective Writing

On March 22nd, in Lhasa, Shannan, Qamdo and other major agricultural areas of Tibet, emancipated Tibetan farmers were engaged in intense and joyful spring planting. This report presents some on-the-spot scenes and new people and events from spring planting in Tibetan rural areas on that day.

	Busy Planting on the Lhasa Plain

On the Lhasa Plain, the sun shone brightly that day under a clear blue sky. At dawn, as the morning sun just touched the golden roof of the Potala Palace, the fields of Nangang Ouxie Township in the western suburbs of Lhasa City were already bustling. All the farmers of the Dongfeng Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team in A'ya Village put on new clothes, waved the national flag and colorful flags, tied red tassels and hadas to their oxen and farm tools, and celebrated their first spring planting season in a grand ethnic style. In the fields, colorful flags fluttered and pine smoke swirled. Gesang Baizhen, the leader of the mutual aid team, offered highland barley wine to the three oxen, and the little girl Yangzong held dyed wheat ears to wish the plowmen a good harvest. Thus began an extraordinary spring planting. Three iron plows quickly turned over the water-rich and fertile soil amidst cheers. Following closely behind the iron plows, three women sowed the carefully selected wheat seeds into the furrows. Further behind were groups of people picking up grass roots and building field ridges. Ten capable young women lined up in two rows, very nimbly and carefully dividing the sown land into neat and straight small ridges. They sang beautiful Tibetan folk songs, expressing their infinite joy. The young man Gesang happily used a wooden harrow to crush the soil clods in the field. In the past, crushing soil clods required tapping with small wooden sticks, which was both laborious and time-consuming. Now, using the newly made wooden harrow to level the ground, one hour of work is equivalent to forty people tapping with wooden sticks for a day.

In the past, under feudal rule, Tibetan serfs farmed extremely extensively. When planting, they used two oxen to drag a wooden plow around the edge of the field in circles, making a shallow groove. The serfs used a sharpened wooden stick to poke a hole along the shallow groove, dropped a pinch of seeds, and the fields were uneven with soil clods everywhere. Last year, after the democratic reform movement in the vast rural areas, the productive forces were liberated, and the emancipated farmers' enthusiasm for production soared unprecedentedly. They actively improved farm tools and farming methods under the leadership of the Party. On this day, the Dongfeng Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team's seven *ke* "Thousand Catty Field" adopted row planting and appropriate close planting. From the plows used for turning the soil to the baskets used for spreading manure, all were new farm tools that had been reformed.

In previous years, under the rule of the feudal serf system, Tibetan farmers in Nangang Ouxie Township felt particularly sad during spring planting because the sowing and labor belonged to them, but the harvest and enjoyment belonged to the three major feudal lords. This year, the emancipated farmers have land, oxen, farm tools, and seeds. They harvest the fruits of spring planting themselves, so everyone is in high spirits and full of energy. Bu Bu Ci Ren and his wife Zhuoma from the Satellite Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team in Nangang Ouxie Township, while working on their more than ten *ke* of land, discussed how to strengthen field management after sowing and strive for an extraordinary bumper harvest. A woman named Gu Sang Deqing, recalling the scenes of being beaten by supervisors during past spring plantings, said to Bu Bu Ci Ren and his wife with emotion: "Now, we can no longer see the ferocious faces of landlords and supervisors in the fields, there are no more whips and sticks, everywhere are red flags and laughter. We are working for ourselves, and we don't feel tired at all."

	On-Site Meeting

On March 22nd, it was already the third day of spring planting in Zedang District of Nedong County in the Shannan Prefecture. On this day, the Nedong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting on planting techniques on a piece of land called "Sare" by the Yarlung Zangbo River. According to legend, more than a thousand years ago, the Tibetan people first tried planting crops, starting from "Sare." Early in the morning, members of the Farmers' Association, leaders of the Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Teams, and dozens of experienced old farmers from Zedang District came to the "Sare" field in the morning sun to watch the demonstration of new planting techniques.

When the on-site meeting on planting techniques began, Yue Shengyun, the Secretary of the Nedong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, picked up a shovel and skillfully and evenly spread the manure piled on the ground. While operating, he explained the importance of fertilization to the old farmers. This aroused everyone's interest. They said that in the past, they rarely fertilized when planting, but now each *ke* of land requires 20,000 *jin* of fertilizer, which is really amazing. Everyone immediately learned from the County Party Secretary, picked up shovels, and scattered manure into the fields.

After fertilization, several old plowmen from Zedang Township and Ga Jun, a member of the Zedang Township Farmers' Association, drove strong oxen, plowing the loose, oily black soil furrow by furrow. While plowing, they said to the people attending the on-site meeting: "Now we have become the masters of the land, and we can no longer work for the feudal lords like we did in the past, plowing one furrow and leaving a ridge. We must plow furrow by furrow to achieve deep plowing and fine plowing, and strive for a good harvest of grain."

Then, with a shout, four young shock team members hitched two mules pulling harrows and leveled the plowed land. In the past, Tibetan farmers did not have harrows for leveling land, nor did they use mules for plowing. During the farm tool reform movement, Nedong County broke with convention, trained hundreds of mules and horses, and manufactured more than 50,000 harrows.

After plowing the land, Xue Ba and Zhuoma Ze Zhu, two experienced sowers, followed the furrows and sowed the large, fertile highland barley seeds into the ground. Subsequently, the women straightened the ridges of the sown land, so that the seeds sown in the ground were tightly covered by a thin layer of soil. In order to meet the requirements of high yield, this year Nedong County generally planted more densely than in previous years by more than 20%.

Everyone who participated in the on-site meeting on new planting techniques said that they had learned a lot of new things in half a day and would immediately promote them after returning.

	Labor Songs on the Banks of the Angqu River

On this day, on the banks of the Angqu River in Qamdo, where the spring sun was bright, the members of the Pioneer Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team got up especially early. Men, women, old and young, carrying national flags, portraits of Chairman Mao, oxen, farm tools, and seeds, marched towards the fields to the sound of gongs and drums. They first came to the field of Deputy Leader Zhaja. Zhaja went to the district for a production meeting today, and everyone said that they should plant his field first.

Zhaxi Raodeng, the director of the Farmers' Association, was the first to break ground and start plowing. He skillfully drove the new-style walking plow issued by the Qamdo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Team Leader Laxi nimbly followed behind to sow seeds. This emancipated female serf picked up a handful of plump and shiny highland barley seeds and said to the farmers next to her: "Look how fat the seeds are." Zhaja's wife, who was sowing on her own land, was particularly emotional. In previous years, she cultivated this land for the feudal lords, and the landlord's whip flew in front of and behind her. She went hungry and suffered, and all the grain she produced was taken away by the feudal lords. Today, working for herself on the same land, this was something she never dreamed of in the past. Last winter and this spring, Zhaja and she both joined the Pioneer Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Team. They worked hard all winter and fought hard all spring, applying 5,000 *jin* of base fertilizer to the field and deep plowing it four times. They plan to apply topdressing once after the highland barley sprouts, pull weeds four times, strengthen field management, and ensure a good harvest of grain.

In the evening, the farmers were reluctant to leave the fields, and they did not go home until it was completely dark. They sang all the way home. After singing "The East is Red" and "Socialism is Good," they sang their own newly composed songs:

The red sun rises on the eastern mountain,
That is our benefactor, Chairman Mao;
Dispelling the dark clouds and driving away the darkness,
The sun shines on us as masters;
Embarking on the path of mutual aid and cooperation,
We will never forget the Communist Party.

    西藏春播的一天
    新华社西藏分社记者、西藏日报记者集体采写
    3月22日，在拉萨、山南和昌都等西藏主要农业区，翻身后的藏族农民们进行了紧张愉快的春耕播种。这里报道了这一天西藏农村春播中的一些现场情景和新人新事。
      拉萨平原播种忙
    在拉萨平原上，这天红日普照，晴空万里。黎明，当朝阳刚刚照上布达拉宫的金顶时，拉萨市西郊区南岗欧协乡的田野上早已沸腾起来。阿亚村东风农业生产互助组全组农民都穿上了新衣，打着国旗和彩旗，给耕牛和农具系上了红缨和哈达，用隆重的民族形式来庆祝属于他们自己的第一个春播季节。田头上，彩旗飘扬，松烟萦绕。互助组组长格桑白真向三头耕牛献了青稞酒，小姑娘央宗端着染色的小麦穗向犁手们预祝丰收。于是一次不寻常的春播开始了。三架铁犁在人们的欢呼中迅速翻开了水饱肥足的泥土。紧跟在铁犁后面，三个妇女把精选过好几次的小麦良种播到犁沟里。再后面就是拾草根打畦埂的人群。十名能干的青年妇女排成两行，非常敏捷细心地把播种后的田土分割成一条条整齐平直的小畦，她们唱着优美的藏族民歌，表示内心的无限欢乐。小伙子格桑架着一盘木耙愉快地在地里压碎土坷垃。过去把地里的土坷垃弄碎得用小木棒敲打，既费劲又费时，现在用新制出来的木耙平地，一个小时的工效相当于过去四十个人用木棒敲打一天。
    过去，西藏农奴在封建统治下，耕作极为粗放，播种时，用两头牛拖着木犁围着地头转圆圈，浅浅地划一道沟，农奴用一根削尖的木棒，沿着浅沟捣一个洞，丢一撮种籽，田土高低不平，到处都是土坷垃。去年，广大农村经过民主改革运动，生产力解放了，翻身农民在党的领导下生产热情空前高涨，积极改进了农具和耕作方法。这一天，东风农业生产互助组的七克“千斤田”采用了条播和适当密植，从翻地用的犁到撒粪用的筐，全是经过改革的新农具。
    往年，南岗欧协乡的藏族农民在封建农奴制度统治下，每逢春播心里倍加忧伤，因为播种和劳役属于自己，收获和享受却属于三大封建领主。今年，翻身农民有了土地，有了耕牛，有了农具和种籽，春播的果实自己收获，因而人人心情振奋，个个干劲冲天。南岗欧协乡卫星农业生产互助组的卜布次仁和他的妻子卓玛，在自己的十多克土地上一边劳动一边谈论着播种后如何加强田间管理，争取特大丰收。一个名叫古桑德庆的妇女回忆起过去春播中受监工毒打的情景时，感慨地对卜布次仁夫妇说：“现在，田头上再也看不见领主和监工的凶恶面孔了，再没有皮鞭和木棍了，到处是红旗和欢笑，自己给自己干活，一点也不觉得累。”
          现场会议
    3月22日，在山南专区乃东县的泽当区已经是春播的第三天了。这天，中共乃东县委会在雅鲁藏布江边一块名叫“撒惹”的田地上召开了一次播种技术现场会议。相传，一千多年前，西藏人民第一次试种田地，就是从“撒惹”开始的。大清早，泽当区各农民协会委员、各农业生产互助组组长和几十个有经验的老农民，迎着朝阳来到“撒惹”地里，观看播种新技术表演。
    播种技术的现场会议开始时，中共乃东县委书记岳升云拿起铁锹，把堆在地里的粪肥熟练而均匀地撒开。他一面操作，一面向老农民讲解施肥的重要性。这事引起了大家的兴趣。他们说，过去种地很少施肥，现在每克地要施两万斤肥料，真是了不起的事。大家立刻学着县委书记的样，拿起铁锹，向田里扬撒粪肥。
    施肥以后，泽当乡的几个老犁手和泽当乡农民协会委员噶均?喝着肥壮的耕牛，一犁挨一犁地翻起了酥松油黑的泥土。他们一边犁地，一边向参加现场会议的人们说：“现在我们成了土地的主人，再不能像过去为封建领主干活那样，犁一沟、留一埂，一定要一犁挨一犁，作到深耕细犁，争取粮食丰收。”
    接着，四个青年突击队的小伙子一声呐喊，架上两头拉着耙的骡马，把犁过的土地耙得平平坦坦。西藏农民过去平地没有耙，也不用骡马耕地。农具改革运动中，乃东县大破常规，训练了几百头骡马，制造了五万多盘耙。
    犁完地，学巴和卓玛泽珠两个有经验的播种手顺着犁沟，把颗粒肥大的青稞良种撒到地里。随后，妇女们把播种后的土地整理出笔直的畦埂，使播在地里的种子被一层薄土严严地掩盖了。为了达到丰产的要求，今年乃东县农村普遍比往年密植了20％以上。
    参加播种新技术现场会议的人们都说半天里就学到很多新东西，回去后一定要马上推广。
    昂曲河畔的劳动歌声
    这天，在春光明媚的昌都昂曲河畔，先锋农业生产互助组的组员们起得特别早，男女老少打着国旗，抬着毛主席画像，牵着耕牛，扛着农具和种籽，敲锣打鼓地向田间出发了。他们首先来到了副组长扎加的地里。扎加今天到区里开生产会议去了，大家都说应该先给他的地下种。
    农会主任扎西绕登首先破土开犁，他熟练地驾御着中共昌都县委会发给的新式步犁，组长拉喜敏捷地跟在后边撒种。这位翻身的女农奴抓起一把颗粒饱满发亮的青稞麦种对旁边的农民们说：“你看麦种多胖。”在自己土地上播种的扎加的妻子感慨特别深，往年她在这块土地上给封建领主耕种，领主的皮鞭在她身前身后飞舞，自己挨饿受累，种出的粮食全部给封建领主拿走。今天，在同样的土地上为自己劳动，这是她过去连作梦也没有想到的事。去冬今春，扎加和她都参加了先锋农业生产互助组，他们大干一冬，苦战一春，在地里施了五千斤基肥，深耕了四遍，他们计划等青稞出苗以后，还要施一次追肥，拔四次草，加强田间管理，确保粮食丰收。
    傍晚了，农民们还舍不得离开田地，直到天完全黑尽了，他们才恋恋不舍地回家。他们走在回家的路上，一路高歌，唱了“东方红”和“社会主义好”之后，又唱起了他们自己新编的歌子：
    东南山上升起了红太阳，
    那就是恩人毛主席；
    驱散乌云赶走黑暗，
    阳光照耀我们作主人；
    走上互助合作的大道，
    永远不忘共产党。
