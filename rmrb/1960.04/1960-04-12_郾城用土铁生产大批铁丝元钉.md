Xinhua News Agency report: Yancheng County, Henan Province, has successfully trial-produced tens of thousands of jin of high-quality iron wire and tacks using indigenous iron.

Over the past two years, Yancheng County's technology for utilizing indigenous iron has also gradually improved. Initially, they could only use indigenous iron to manufacture small agricultural implements, but later they were able to manufacture more precise and valuable machinery. As agricultural construction gradually developed towards mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, a large number of iron wires and tacks were needed. Based on this situation, the Yancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed: "If we don't have wrought iron, we will smelt it ourselves; if we don't understand the technology, we will study it ourselves; if we don't have the tools, we will make them ourselves." They called on all regions to "fight for pulling out a foot of iron wire," and launched a vigorous movement to trial-produce iron wire and tacks throughout the county, quickly breaking through the technical barriers. Now, the commune-run factories throughout the county have achieved semi-mechanization in the production of iron wire and tacks. The daily output of iron wire has increased from the initial 150 jin to 2,500 jin. With a large amount of self-made iron wire and tacks, the county has not only solved the urgent need for materials in water conservancy, electricity, and basic construction, but also used these iron wires to make high-quality pedicabs and bicycle spokes.

The Henan Provincial Department of Commerce held an on-site meeting here, and representatives from the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery Industry also attended the meeting. The meeting decided to promote this experience in the vast rural areas of the country.

    郾城用土铁生产大批铁丝元钉
    据新华社讯　河南省郾城县利用土铁试制成功了几万斤质量很好的铁丝和元钉。
    两年来，郾城县利用土铁的技术也逐步提高。开始只能用土铁制造一些小件农具，后来就能制造一些比较精密贵重的机具。随着农业建设逐步向机械化、水利化、电气化方向发展，又需要大批铁丝、元钉。中共郾城县委根据这个情况，提出：“没有熟铁自己炼，不懂技术自己钻，没有工具自己造”，号召各地“为拔出一尺铁丝而战”，在全县范围内开展了轰轰烈烈的试制铁丝、元钉运动，很快地就突破了技术关。现在，全县各社办工厂在生产铁丝、元钉方面已经实现了半机械化，铁丝日产量已由最初一百五十斤提高到了二千五百斤。由于有了自己制造的大量的铁丝、元钉，全县不仅解决了水利、电气、基本建设等方面的急需用材，并利用这些铁丝制成了质量很好的人力车、自行车辐条。
    河南省商业厅曾在这里召开现场会议，轻工业部和农业机械工业部也派人出席了这次会议。会议决定在全国广大农村推广。
