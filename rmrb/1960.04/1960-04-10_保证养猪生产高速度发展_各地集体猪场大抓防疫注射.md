Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Various localities are achieving success in vigorously grasping epidemic prevention work in collective pig raising. The situation of "peach blossoms bloom, swine fever comes" has been changed. Since the beginning of spring, various localities have implemented the principle of "prevention is more important than treatment" in carrying out pig epidemic prevention campaigns, vigorously grasping preventive inoculation, so that the incidence of pig diseases has significantly decreased compared with the same period last year. In Shandong Province, there are fewer pig diseases this spring, and the mortality rate of pig epidemics has dropped from 0.93% in the past to 0.3%, basically controlling several major pig diseases such as swine erysipelas. Fifty-five counties and cities in the province have achieved disease-free pigs. Xing'an County in Guangxi also has one hundred and thirty pig farms that have achieved no sick pigs and no dead pigs.

This spring, the preventive inoculation of pigs is more common in various localities. In eight provinces (cities, regions) including Shanghai, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan, by mid-March, 57% of the pigs in these provinces (cities, regions) had been inoculated with two (swine fever, swine pneumonia) or three (swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine pneumonia) vaccines. Inoculation is still continuing. Sichuan Province, which has the most pigs, launched a pig disease prevention and control campaign in January. By the end of February, more than one million pigs in the province had been inoculated with vaccines such as swine fever. In Minhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, the counties organized 55,000 cadres, veterinarians, epidemic prevention personnel, breeders, youth, and women to adopt a comprehensive blitz, contract by area, and check each pen to make 90% of the pigs in the prefecture inoculated with swine erysipelas and swine pneumonia vaccines, and 100% inoculated with swine fever vaccine. In Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, a blitz inoculation was carried out throughout the county. All pigs were inoculated with swine fever vaccine in one day, except for piglets born that day. From late February to early March, Jilin Province launched a livestock epidemic prevention campaign throughout the province. Dehui, Qian'an, and other counties, which acted quickly, have basically completed the work of inoculating pigs with swine fever vaccine.

While grasping preventive inoculation, various localities actively cultivate veterinary epidemic prevention personnel, establish veterinary epidemic prevention networks, and adopt indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to run veterinary drug manufacturing plants. Jilin Province adopted the method of running pig epidemic prevention and control training classes at all levels, and trained a total of 20,000 epidemic prevention technicians throughout the province. Since last winter, Anhui Province has also trained more than 20,000 veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel through running training classes, holding on-site meetings, and imparting technology.

Most of the more than 200 breeders in the 64 pig farms of the Longtan People's Commune in Dali, Yunnan, can identify general pig diseases and can also prepare Chinese medicine prescriptions. Pigs are immediately isolated and treated as soon as they get sick. In Fujian Province, 54 counties, more than 700 communes, and more than 4,000 large teams have established veterinary institutions, with more than 29,000 veterinary personnel. Each commune in Longyan Prefecture, Fujian, has established a livestock veterinary station, and Nanping Prefecture has basically achieved veterinary institutions in every commune and team. Shandong Province has achieved a livestock veterinary hospital in every county, a livestock veterinary station in every commune, and an epidemic prevention officer in every team and farm. The veterinary drug factory established by Taixing County, Jiangsu, using indigenous methods, can manufacture livestock native drugs and crude chlortetracycline and aureomycin, and also supply the county's required swine fever rabbit vaccine. Various localities also actively collect and prepare Chinese medicinal materials to prevent and treat pig diseases. Ningxiang County, Hunan, has produced more than 80,000 jin of various native drugs.

Combining preventive inoculation, various localities vigorously produce pig feed to make pigs eat well and increase their disease resistance. At the same time, various localities have also generally strengthened feeding management and improved pig hygiene conditions. Shuangfeng County, Hunan, combined preventive inoculation with a mass pig pen disinfection and hygiene campaign, and also established and improved a regular pen cleaning system. In Yichuan County, Shaanxi, the pig farms of each commune, management area, and production team have established epidemic prevention systems and epidemic prevention covenants.

During the epidemic prevention campaign, the Party committees in various localities strengthened their leadership over pig disease prevention and control work. Sichuan Province has established epidemic prevention institutions at all levels from the prefecture to the commune management area to strengthen specific leadership. Each county and commune in Jilin Province has established specialized pig disease prevention and control organizations, and designated special personnel to be responsible. Each pig farm has established an epidemic prevention team.

    保证养猪生产高速度发展
    各地集体猪场大抓防疫注射
    新华社9日讯　各地大抓集体养猪的防疫工作获得成绩，所谓
  “桃花开，猪瘟来”的情况已经改变。入春以来，各地在开展养猪防疫运动中贯彻了“防重于治”的方针，大抓防疫注射，使猪的发病率比去年同期有了显著的下降。山东省今春猪病较少，猪疫病的死亡率已由以往的0.93％下降到0.3％，基本上控制了猪丹毒等几种主要猪病。全省有五十五个县市实现了无猪病。广西兴安县也有一百三十个养猪场做到了无病猪、无死猪。
    今春各地对猪的防疫注射较普遍。上海、河北、山西、山东、浙江、福建、广西、云南八个省（市、区），到3月中旬已有占这些省（市、区）养猪头数57％的猪注射了二种（猪瘟、猪肺疫）或三种（猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫）病的免疫苗。目前仍在继续注射。养猪最多的四川省，在1月份就开展了防治猪病运动，到2月下旬全省已有一百多万头猪注射了猪瘟等疫苗。福建省闽侯专区各县组织干部、兽医员、防疫员、饲养员、青年、妇女等五万五千多人，采取全面突击，分片包干，逐栏检查的办法，使全区90％以上的猪注射了猪丹毒、猪肺疫疫苗，注射猪瘟疫苗的达100％。湖南省湘乡县全县突击注射，在一天内，除了当天生下的小猪外，全部都注射了猪瘟疫苗。吉林省从2月下旬到3月上旬在全省范围内开展了一个畜牧防疫运动，行动较快的德惠、乾安等县为猪注射猪瘟疫苗工作已基本结束。
    各地在抓防疫注射的同时，积极培养兽医防疫人员，建立兽医防疫网，采取土法上马、土洋并举的办法大办兽用药品制造厂。吉林省采取层层开办猪疫病防治训练班的办法，全省共训练了防疫技术员两万人。安徽省从去冬以来，通过大办训练班、开现场会、传授技术等办法，也训练了兽医、防疫员两万多人。
    云南大理龙潭人民公社六十四个养猪场的二百多个饲养员，大多数已能识别一般猪病，还能配制中药处方，猪一生病就马上隔离治疗。福建全省有五十四个县、七百多个公社、四千多个大队建立了兽医机构，有兽医人员二万九千多人。福建龙岩专区各公社都建立了畜牧兽医站，南平专区基本上实现社社、队队有兽医机构。山东省已作到县有畜牧兽医院、社有畜牧兽医站、队队场场都有防疫员。江苏泰兴县以土法上马创办的兽用药品厂，能制造畜土药和粗制土霉素和金霉素，并且供应全县所需的猪瘟兔化疫苗。各地还积极采制中药材防治猪病。湖南宁乡县已制出各种土药八万多斤。
    各地结合防疫注射，大搞猪饲料，使猪吃的好，增加抗病能力，同时各地还普遍加强了饲养管理、改善猪的卫生条件。湖南双峰县结合防疫注射，开展群众性的猪栏消毒卫生运动，同时建立和健全了经常性的清圈制度。陕西宜川县各公社、管理区、生产队的养猪场都订立了防疫制度和防疫公约。
    在防疫运动中，各地党委都加强了对猪病防治工作的领导。四川省从专区到公社的管理区，层层都建立了防疫机构，加强具体领导。吉林省各县和公社都建立了专门的猪病防治组织，指定专人负责。各养猪场建立了防疫小组。
