    No Longer Can We Live Separately
    Han Fuxiu, Obstetrics Doctor, Central Hospital of South Pyongan Province, Korea
    I walked out of the operating room.
    While my hands were still immersed in disinfectant, a pale and miserable face appeared before my eyes. It was an older sister I had seen at the Seoul Women's University Hospital, and I couldn't forget her for a long time.
    That older sister's face was pale, her whole body was convulsing, and her eyes were devoid of expression. It was clear that she was on the verge of death.
    This seriously ill patient, who had been rushed in by a dilapidated vehicle, was wearing tattered clothes, and it was clear at a glance that she was a poor and simple farm woman.
    Hearing that an emergency patient had arrived, the doctors rushed over.
    After diagnosing her in the outpatient clinic, the doctor said that it was an ectopic pregnancy and that she needed immediate surgery, otherwise her life would be in danger.
    At this time, someone from the registration office came out and said coldly: "According to hospital regulations, surgery fees must be paid before admission. If you don't have money, don't even think about having surgery." Faced with such a wooden and cruel voice, a middle-aged man standing next to him, who appeared to be the patient's husband, anxiously pleaded: "Gentlemen! Please have mercy! As long as you save her life, the money... the money will be here tomorrow. Please save her, gentlemen!"
    The older sister was still moaning and gasping. The moans became more and more miserable, and the gasps became more and more rapid. This only aroused the hospital authorities' disgust even more, and the authorities roared: "If you don't have money, get out quickly...!" In fact, there were not many patients in the hospital that day, and the doctors were all idle.
    When another nurse and I saw the patient's face contorted in pain and heard her sad moans, we couldn't help but shed tears, and we also pleaded with the doctor to help her, to save her. But the answer we got was: "What do you know? It's none of your business!"
    Before we knew it, the sun had restrained its faint brilliance. Dusk came. What a desolate and stifling evening! The same dilapidated vehicle, dragging the older sister's body, slowly drove out of the hospital gate and slowly disappeared into the boundless darkness…
    From that day on, I became even more aware of that cruel and inhuman society, and I resolved to become a doctor who could save people. With my human conscience, I will use my entire soul and lifelong efforts to save the glorious lives of the oppressed and despised working people.
    I only worked at the Seoul Women's University Hospital for a few months. But how many similar incidents have I witnessed?
    Now, the older sister Kim Jeong-ui from Unsan County, South Pyongan Province, whom I just operated on, was in a much more serious condition than the older sister who died in the Seoul hospital. However, under the attentive care of the medical staff, she not only had a successful operation, but countless people rushed to donate blood to her. Now, older sister Kim Jeong-ui has received one kilogram and two hundred CC of fresh blood. She quickly escaped danger.
    She, this ordinary rural woman, is now lying in this white, quiet ward, sleeping on this soft wire bed, so quiet and peaceful.
    Two older sisters, one in the South and one in the North, have such drastically different experiences. Isn't this a stark contrast?
    It is not difficult to predict that at this very moment, in the South of our country, how many compatriots are struggling in pain, collapsing, and dying under the ravages of hunger and disease... Now, South Korea has become a world where gold is all-powerful. Under the domination of "gold worship," the lives of poor people are far less precious than the lives of flies. In that hell on earth, in a small village in Cheongdo County, North Gyeongsang Province, in a corner of South Korea, my elderly parents still live.
    When I think of these things, it is as if I see my parents wandering barefoot in the heavy snow, as if I see them spending their twilight years on the line of hunger and disease...
    Why is it that the people of the Republic in the North can receive clinical treatment in comfortable and quiet hospitals even without money, while in South Korea, which is so close, our relatives live in the misery of dire straits!
    The tragic clouds over the South of our country must dissipate, and those rare tragedies must end. My parents, and all the compatriots in the South, can no longer live separately.

### 再也不能分开活下去

    再也不能分开活下去
    朝鲜平南道中央医院产科医生　韩福修
    我走出了手术室。
    当我的手还浸在消毒水里时，眼前却浮显出一幅苍白而凄惨的面影。这是我在汉城女子大学医院时所看到过，而且久久不能忘怀的一位大嫂。
    那位大嫂面色惨白，全身痉挛，眼睛毫无神彩。看得出，她正处在死亡的边缘。
    被一辆破旧不堪的车子赶忙送了来的这位重病患者，身穿褴褛的衣服，一看就知道她是个穷苦纯朴的农家妇女。
    听说来了急诊患者，大夫们蜂拥而来。
    医生在门诊室里诊断后说这是子宫外孕，需要立刻动手术，否则生命难保。
    这时，挂号房有人出来，冷冰冰地说：“根据医院规定，要先交手术费方能入院。要是没有钱嘛，那可休想动手术。”对着这样一种木然而残酷的声音，当时站在旁边的一位陌生的中年男子，看来是病妇的丈夫，焦急地恳求道：“先生们！你们修修好吧！只要你们把她命救出来，钱……，钱是明天准拿。救救她吧！先生们！”
    大嫂依然在呻吟着、喘息着。呻吟声越来越凄惨，喘息声越来越急促。这也就更加惹起了医院当局的厌烦，当局大发雷霆地说：“没有钱，赶快滚蛋……！”其实，这一天医院里并没有多少患者，大夫们也都在闲着。
    当我和另一个护士，看到病人那被痛苦折磨的面容，听到她那悲哀的呻吟时，不禁滴下了泪水，也恳求过医生去帮助她，救救她。但是，得到的回答却是：“你们懂什么？不关你们的事！”
    不知什么时候，太阳收敛了它那残淡的光辉。黄昏来了。这是多么凄凉，多么窒闷的傍晚呀！依旧是那辆残破不堪的车子，拖着大嫂的尸体沉沉地走出了病院门口，向着无边的黑暗徐徐走去……。
    从那天起，我更认清了那残酷的、没有人性的社会，并决心立志成为一个能够救人的医生。我凭着人类的良心，将用我的整个灵魂和毕生的努力去挽救那被压迫、被贱视的劳动人民光辉的生命。
    我在汉城女子大学医院里工作仅只几个月。但所目击过的类似事件又何止一桩呢？
    现在，我刚动过手术的，这位来自平南道云山郡的金贞义大嫂，病情原比死在汉城医院里的那位大嫂严重得多。可是，在医务人员的殷勤关怀下，她不仅顺利地动了手术，而且不知有多少人争先恐后地要求为她输血。如今，金贞义大嫂已输了一公斤二百CC的鲜血。很快地脱离了险境。
    她，这位平凡的农村妇女，如今已经躺在这所洁白的、宁静的入院室里，睡在这软绵绵的钢丝床上，是那样静穆而安祥。
    两位大嫂，一个在南，一个在北，就有着如此截然不同的遭遇，难道这不是鲜明的对照吗？
    不难料到，就在这一刻，在祖国的南方，又有多少同胞，在饥饿和疾病的摧残下，正在痛苦地挣扎，在倒下，在死去……。如今，南朝鲜变成黄金万能的世界。在“黄金主义”的支配下，贫苦人民的生命已经远远不如苍蝇的生命宝贵。在那个人间地狱里，在南朝鲜的一隅——庆尚北道清道郡的一个小小的村落里，还生活着我那年迈的父母。
    当我想到这些，就仿佛看到了在大风雪里光脚徘徊的父母，仿佛看到他们正在那饥饿和疾病线上度着他们的风烛残年……
    为什么，共和国北部的人民，尽管没有钱也能在舒适而宁静的医院里得到临床治疗，然而就在近咫尺的南朝鲜，我们的亲人们却生活在水深火热的苦难中！
    笼罩在祖国南方的悲惨的乌云必须消散，那些千古罕见的悲剧，必须结束。我和我的双亲，和在南方的全体同胞，再也不能分开活下去了。
