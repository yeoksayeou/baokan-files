    Poetic and Pictorial
      Painting by Li Qi, Poem by Jiang Cheng
    --Mom is a worker auntie now!
    --No, Mom is a middle school student.
    Two children are around the table,
    Quarreling like magpies.
    Mom laughed heartily when she heard this,
    Good children, you have understood my heart.
    If it weren't for the establishment of the People's Commune,
    How could Mom be a worker and a student at the same time!

    诗情画意
      李琦画  江城诗
    ——妈妈当了工人阿姨啦，
    ——不，妈妈当了中学生。
    两个孩子围着桌子，
    像花喜鹊一样争个不停。
    妈妈听了哈哈笑，
    好孩子，你们猜透了妈妈的心。
    若不是成立人民公社，
    妈妈哪能当工人又当学生！
