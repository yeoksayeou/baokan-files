    A picture of infinitely warm human life appears before our eyes. From the countryside to the city, hundreds of millions of people have organized people's communes, established public canteens, and countless service centers specifically for people's lives have appeared on city streets and in neighborhoods. Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the General Line, people work together, labor together, and arrange their lives together. Children go to nurseries, older ones go to school, couples go to work together, and the house keys are handed over to the service center. When they return home from work in the evening, the service staff cleans and tidies the house, fills the thermos with boiling water, and lights the stove. The canteen prepares hot meals and dishes. People's thoughts are broad and rich, and their minds are always occupied with the interests of the collective, the common labor, and the great and small achievements of socialist construction; they no longer bother to compare personal gains and losses, or meticulously calculate personal advantages and disadvantages. From the practice of socialist revolution and socialist construction, they deeply experience a truth: for the common future of everyone, and to contribute personal labor and wisdom as much as possible for others, is also for oneself. People's thoughts have been liberated from the narrow and humble lives of the past, abandoning the small personal nests and flying to the boundless blue sky and green fields of life. People who were originally unrelated have become so close and inseparable.
    An ordinary thing that many of us would encounter keeps me from forgetting it for a long time. One night, it was already past eleven o'clock in the middle of the night, at a bus stop, among the people getting off a last bus, a person from out of town asked people how to get to the Agricultural Exhibition Hall. It turned out that he had come from Gansu with a group to visit the Agricultural Exhibition, and had only been in Beijing for two or three days. Everyone lived in the dormitory of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall. That day, he was delayed in the city because of something and could not catch the last bus to the Agricultural Exhibition Hall at night. People pointed out the direction to the Agricultural Exhibition Hall, but it was still a long way to the Agricultural Exhibition Hall outside the eastern city. Then, a person came out from the crowd and said, "Come on, I'll go with you." The person from out of town declined for a moment, and the two walked off together. Under the streetlights in the deep night, watching the backs of the two of them walking side by side along the long road, they looked like two brothers reunited in a foreign land.
    From our entire society to every individual, we are undergoing a profound change, a great transformation whose full significance we may not yet be able to understand so deeply. In these days, it is easy to recall the scenes of life in the old society. At that time, a small number of people lived in luxury, while the vast majority of working people were oppressed and exploited. The upside-down life suppressed people's beautiful pursuits and destroyed the will to live. People were isolated from each other on the road to survival, becoming so narrow-minded and selfish for personal survival. The whole society was full of ruthlessness. The perverted consciousness of mankind produced one tragedy after another.
    Such an era should have ended long ago. Once a picture of ruthless human life becomes a thing of the past, looking back and thinking about it, it is really hard to understand: why can't people share a pot and eat at the same table, and arrange everyone's life together? The walls of houses were originally built to resist wind and rain, but why have they become barriers that cannot be communicated between people? Such things, in the long past, could only be unrealizable fantasies, but on the road to communism, it has become a shining fact.

    换了人间	张敏
    一幅无限温暖的人间生活的图画在我们眼前出现了。从乡村到城市，亿万人组织了人民公社，建立了公共食堂，在城市的街道上、邻里间出现了无数专门为人们的生活服务的服务所。在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，人们一同工作，一同劳动，一同来安排自己的生活。孩子上了托儿所，大的上了学，夫妻两人一同去上班，家里的钥匙交给服务所；黄昏下班回来，服务员把家里收拾得清洁又整齐，暖瓶里灌满了开水，火炉里已经把火生着，食堂里准备好了热腾腾的饭和菜。人们的思想，开阔而又丰富，时时刻刻萦绕在脑际的，是集体的利益，是共同的劳动，是社会主义建设的大小成果；再也无心去比较个人的得失，斤斤计算个人的利害了。他们从社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实践中深切地体验了一条真理：为了大家共同的将来，为了别人尽量贡献个人的劳动和智慧，同时也就是为了自己。人们的思想，从过去的狭隘、卑微的生活中解脱出来，抛弃了个人的狭小的窝巢，飞向了无限广阔的生活的碧空绿野。原来互不相关的人们变得那么亲近，那么不可分离。
    一件普普通通的、我们许多人都会碰到的事情使我久久不能忘怀。一个晚上，已经是深夜十一点多钟了，在一个公共汽车站上，从一辆末班车下车的人们当中，一个从外地来的人向人们打听去农业展览馆怎么走。原来他是从甘肃随着团体来参观农业展览会的，到北京才两三天，大伙住在农业展览馆的宿舍里，这一天因为在城里有事情耽搁，夜里赶不上去农业展览馆的末班公共汽车了。人们给他指点去农业展览馆的方向，可是从这里到东城外的农业展览馆还要走好长的路呵。于是，从人们当中走出一个人来，说了声“走，我陪你去。”那个外地来的人推辞了一下，两个人就一起走了。在深夜的街灯下，沿着那一条长长的马路，看着他们两个并肩走去的背影，就像两个异地重逢的兄弟。
    从我们整个社会到每一个人，都正在经历着一次无比深刻的大变化，一次我们现在也许还不能那么深透地了解它的全部意义的伟大的变革。在这些日子里，很容易使人回想起旧社会的生活的情景。那时候，少数人养尊处优，绝大多数劳动人民受压迫、被剥削。颠倒的生活压抑着人们的美好的追求，毁灭生命的意志。人们互相隔绝在各自求生的道路上，为了个人的生存变得那么狭隘和自私。整个社会到处是冷酷无情。人类的变态的意识产生了一个世代又一个世代的悲剧。
    这样的时代早就应该结束了。一幅冷酷无情的人间生活的图画一旦成为过去，再回过头去看一看，想一想，真是难以令人理解：为什么人们不能共一个锅灶，同一张桌上吃饭，一起来安排大家的生活？房屋的墙壁本来是为了抵御风雨，为什么却变成了人与人之间的不能相通的藩篱？这样的事，在过去的悠长的年代里，只能是无法实现的幻想，而到了通往共产主义的大道上，它就成为闪闪发光的事实了。
