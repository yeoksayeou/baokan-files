Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan; Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the 1960 National Budget Draft; and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Not long ago, I went to Wuhan with the CPPCC visiting group, and I would now like to combine my experiences from the visit with my understanding of the reports by the two Vice Premiers Li and Vice Chairman Chen to share my thoughts:

First, it has further deepened my understanding of the great role of the Party's leadership and Mao Zedong Thought, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, as well as the great achievements of the national socialist construction in 1959. Consequently, I have a greater understanding of the reactionary crimes of the Kuomintang's reactionary old regime and the bourgeois rightists.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report stated that in 1957, a socialist revolution was carried out on the political and ideological fronts, crushing the bourgeois rightists' rampant attacks on socialism. It also stated that right-leaning opportunists within the Party were spokespersons for anti-socialist elements in society, and that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1959 thoroughly shattered the rampant attacks of right-leaning opportunists within the Party, followed by a nationwide mass movement to oppose rightism, boost morale, increase production, and practice economy, achieving the Great Leap Forward in 1959. Upon hearing Vice Premier Li's words, I was truly shocked and filled with remorse, and felt the need to intensify and thoroughly transform myself.

Having seen the Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction of Hubei Province over Ten Years in Wuhan, the scale was magnificent and the content was rich and colorful. This was an exhibition of Hubei Province's Great Leap Forward. Of course, there must be similar achievement exhibitions in all provinces and autonomous regions across the country, which is equivalent to seeing the whole picture of the national Great Leap Forward. The Hubei Geological Exhibition Hall left the deepest impression on me! The explaining comrade pressed the first button, which showed the minerals discovered before liberation, with only a few lights. Pressing the second button showed the minerals discovered before 1958, and the lights increased many times over. Pressing the third button showed the minerals discovered after 1958, and the lights, like stars in the sky, covered the entire map of Hubei. This is the brilliance of the Party's leadership, the brilliance of the General Line, and the brilliance of the Great Leap Forward. At the same time, it reflected the reactionary incompetence of the Kuomintang rule. I was once a reactionary ruler of Hubei Province, but I did not know that Hubei had such rich mineral resources, thinking that there was nothing except some iron ore in Daye. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, not only could there not be more discoveries, but even the small Hanyeping Iron and Steel Company left over from the Qing Dynasty could not be maintained. Instead, the good iron ore of Daye was sold cheaply to Japanese imperialists to manufacture munitions to invade their own motherland, which is such a shameful and hateful thing.

Take the Yingcheng salt mine as an example. The Yingcheng salt mine was discovered by the working people in gypsum mines countless years ago and is called "gypsum salt." However, the reactionary ruling government used various reasons—toxic and high cost—to prohibit or restrict people from mining it. The reason for this was that they could not levy heavy taxes and obtain high profits like Huai salt. They disregarded the interests of the people of Hubei Province and prohibited or restricted mining. This is another shameful and hateful act of the Kuomintang reactionary government.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report put forward the correct policy of continuing to take steel as the key link in industry and grain as the key link in agriculture, and proposed the magnificent target of 18.4 million tons of steel in 1960 and a 10% increase in grain compared with 1959. I am sure that this can be achieved and even exceeded. The report stated that the planned metallurgical equipment for 1959 was 30,000 to 40,000 tons, but the actual figure reached 255,000 tons, exceeding the plan by more than five times. I believe this lays a strong guarantee for the steel output target in 1960. It also stated that in just two years, we have built more than 1,300 small-scale iron smelting enterprises, of which about 200 can be developed into medium-sized or small-sized iron and steel enterprises. According to my estimate, if each enterprise has an average annual output of 50,000 tons, that would be more than 10 million tons, plus the large-scale iron and steel enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel, then the target of 18.4 million tons in 1960 can certainly be exceeded. We visited the large-scale Wuhan Iron and Steel in Wuhan and saw the mushrooming medium and small-sized iron and steel enterprises along the way, which fully proves this point.

Hubei Province suffered an unprecedented drought in 1959, but under the wise leadership of the Party, under the brilliant light of the General Line, and under the powerful force of the People's Communes, the working people of Hubei finally overcame the natural disaster. All aspects still achieved a Great Leap Forward, and no one starved to death, no one begged for food, no one sold their children, and no one fled the famine. Huangpi County was a severely affected area. In the People's Commune, we saw that the children in the kindergarten were all rosy-cheeked and chubby, and the elderly in the homes for the elderly were all healthy and happy. We did not see any trace of the disaster, but everywhere there was a thriving phenomenon of the Great Leap Forward. Looking back at the great drought in the year of Yichou (said to be equal to 1959), the phenomenon of people dying on the roads and being displaced is truly worlds apart. Now, the people of Hubei Province are working with soaring enthusiasm under the leadership of the Party to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction. It is said that it can be basically completed this year (larger ones may be excluded), and in the future, general floods and droughts in Hubei can be basically avoided. Hubei will become one of the richest granaries in the country, and the same is true for other provinces and regions. From this point, it is fully proven that the national grain target for 1960 can be achieved, and it can also be exceeded.

The technical revolution and technical innovation movement, like other provinces, has set off a high tide in Hubei. We visited two exhibitions of this nature, and the content was extremely rich, especially the "Treasure Offering Platform" and the "Experience Seeking Platform," which moved me the most. "Treasure Offering" means explaining what materials and technologies your factory has that can help other factories. "Experience Seeking" means explaining what materials and technologies your factory lacks and wants other factories to help with. This fully demonstrates the communist style of great collaboration. This is how all factories, large and small (including rural commune factories), under the leadership of the Party, divide labor and cooperate, with industry supporting agriculture.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report stated that the national financial revenue in 1959 increased by 29.4% compared with 1958. Such a rate of growth is astonishing. It also stated that China's financial work has also entered a new situation along with the leap forward in production. The characteristics of this new situation are more revenue, more expenditure, and more construction; more revenue, more expenditure, and more construction. These words of Vice Premier Li not only illustrate and guarantee the continuous growth of financial funds in the future, but also describe the beautiful prospects of socialist construction and communist construction! It is so exciting. It also stated that the national defense expenditure is the same as last year, accounting for only 8.3%, and it is decreasing year by year, which fully demonstrates the ardent desire of the Chinese people to engage in peaceful labor and the firm determination to save national funds and accelerate socialist construction. Perhaps some people will ask whether such low national defense expenditure will weaken China's national defense strength? Facts have proved that the opposite is true. The forces of peace are growing, national defense is becoming more consolidated, and the East wind is prevailing over the West wind. Without industry, there is no national defense; without modern industry, there is no modern national defense. China's national defense policy is very correct.

In short, the important content in the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li is vividly manifested everywhere in Hubei, and there are countless moving deeds everywhere.

Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report pointed out that in the self-transformation of people from all walks of life in the future, we should continue to adopt the method of "gentle breeze and fine rain" and positive education. The method of "gentle breeze and fine rain" is to implement the mass line and use the method of criticism and self-criticism, which is very correct. Over the past few years, I have received education from the masses and have indeed made some progress. In the future, I should learn more from the masses, accept mass education, and seek greater progress. Although ideological transformation is long-term, arduous, and repetitive, under the compelling situation of the Great Leap Forward, I believe that the ideological transformation of old intellectuals should also leap forward. The Party's care for the lives of democratic figures is truly meticulous. There should be no more concerns about life. The only thing to do is to listen to the Party wholeheartedly and transform oneself, so that transformation can leap forward. Please give your comments on whether my speech is appropriate.

### 接受群众教育　以求更大进步  黄绍竑委员的发言

    接受群众教育　以求更大进步
    黄绍竑委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告；李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和陈叔通副主席政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会的报告。
    不久以前我随政协参观团去武汉参观，我现在把参观的体会和听了两位李副总理、陈副主席报告的体会结合起来谈一谈：
    首先是使我更进一步认识到党的领导、毛主席思想，总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大作用，和1959年国家社会主义建设的伟大成绩。因此也就更加认识了国民党反动旧政权和资产阶级右派的反动罪行。
    李富春副总理报告里说1957年进行了政治战线、思想战线上社会主义革命，打垮了资产阶级右派向社会主义的猖狂进攻。又说党内右倾机会主义分子就是社会上反社会主义分子的代言人，1959年党的八届八中全会彻底地粉碎了党内右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻，随后在全国范围内开展了反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约的群众运动，实现了1959年的大跃进。我听了李副总理这段话真是惊心动魄、悔愧交加，更要加紧地彻底地改造自己。
    在武汉看了湖北省十年经济文化建设成就展览会，规模是宏伟的，内容是丰富多采的，这是湖北省大跃进的展览。当然在全国各省各自治区也一定会有这样的成绩展览，这就等于我看到了全国大跃进的全貌。尤其是湖北地质展览馆对我的印象最为深刻！讲解同志按第一个电钮是解放以前发现的矿藏，仅有几点灯光。按第二个电钮是1958年以前发现的矿藏，灯光就多了多少倍。按第三个电钮是1958年以后发现的矿藏，灯光像满天星斗布满了整个湖北地图，这是党领导的光芒，总路线的光芒，大跃进的光芒。同时它反映了国民党统治的反动无能。我曾一度做过湖北省的反动统治者，就不知道湖北有那样丰富的矿藏，以为除了大冶有一些铁矿之外就没有什么东西了。在国民党反动统治时期不但不能有更多的发现，而前清遗留下来的很小的——汉冶萍钢铁企业也不能维持下去，反而把大冶良好的铁矿石廉价卖给日本帝国主义者，供它制造军火侵略自己的祖国，这是多么可耻可恨的事。
    又以应城的盐矿来说吧，应城盐矿不知是多少年前由劳动人民在石膏矿内发现的，叫做——石膏盐。但反动统治政府就用种种原因——有毒和成本高禁止人民开采或限制开采，所以这样，因为不能像淮盐那样抽收重税，和大资本家获得高度的利润，就不顾湖北省人民的利益而禁止或限制开采，这又是国民党反动政府多么可耻可恨的事。
    李富春副总理报告中提出工业继续以钢为纲、农业继续以粮为纲的正确方针，并提出1960年钢一千八百四十万吨，粮食比1959年增长10％左右的宏伟指标。我敢肯定的说这是一定可以达到的并且可以超额完成的。报告里说1959年冶金设备，计划达到三万吨至四万吨，实际达到二十五万五千吨，比计划超出了五倍多，我认为这样就为1960年钢产量指标打下了有力的保证。又说在短短两年中我们就建设起一千三百多个小洋群炼铁企业，其中有二百个左右可发展为中型的或小型的钢铁企业。照我的估计，如果每个每年平均产量为五万吨，那就是一千多万吨，再加上鞍钢、武钢、包钢等大型的钢铁企业，则1960年的一千八百四十万吨指标一定可以超额完成的。我们在武汉参观了规模宏大的武钢和沿途看到雨后春笋般的中小型钢铁企业，就充分证明了这一点。
    湖北省1959年受到百年未有的旱灾，但湖北劳动人民在党的英明领导之下、总路线光辉照耀之下、人民公社强大威力之下，终于战胜了天灾，各方面仍然获得了大跃进，而且没有饿死的人，没有讨饭的人，没有卖儿女的人，没有逃荒的人。黄陂县是重灾县份，我们在人民公社看见幼儿园的小孩都是红红胖胖的，敬老院的老人都是健康愉快的，我们没有看到一点灾荒的痕迹，而是到处都出现大跃进的蓬勃现象。回顾乙丑年的大旱灾（据说与1959年相等的）人民死亡载道，流离失所的现象真有天渊之别。现在湖北全省人民正以冲天干劲在党的领导下大搞水利建设，据说今年就可以基本完成（较大型者可能除外），今后湖北一般的水旱灾害就可以基本避免了。湖北将成为全国有数的丰富粮仓，其他各省区当然也是一样，从这一点上充分证明了1960年全国粮食指标一定可以达到的，还可以超额的。
    技术革命和技术革新运动，湖北同各省一样掀起了高潮。我们参观了两个这种性质的展览会，内容是极其丰富的，尤其献宝台和取经台最令我感动。献宝就是说明自己厂里有什么物质的技术的可以帮助别厂。取经就是说明自己厂里缺什么物质的技术的要别厂帮助。这样充分表现大协作的共产主义风格，这样就是各大小工厂（包括农村公社工厂）在党的领导之下分工合作工业支持农业。
    李先念副总理报告里说1959年国家决算收入同1958年比较，增长29.4％。这样的增长速度是惊人的。又说我国的财政工作随着生产的跃进也进入了一个新局面。这个新局面的特点是多收入，多支出，多建设；更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设。李副总理这几句话不但说明了保证了以后财政经费的不断增长，同时也就等于把社会主义建设和共产主义建设的美好远景描写出来！是多么令人兴奋。又说国防费同上年相等，仅占8.3％，而且是逐年降低的，充分说明了我国人民从事和平劳动的热烈愿望，和节约国家经费加速社会主义建设的坚强决心。也许有人要问这样少的国防经费，会不会削弱我国的国防力量？事实证明恰恰相反，和平力量日益增长国防更加巩固东风压倒了西风。没有工业就没有国防，没有现代工业就没有现代国防，我国国防方针是十分正确的。
    总之，两位李副总理报告里的重要内容在湖北各地都活生生地表现出来，动人的事迹到处都是，真是举不胜举。
    陈叔通副主席的报告里指出：今后在各界民主人士进行自我改造中应该继续采取和风细雨、正面教育的方法。“和风细雨”的方法就是贯彻群众路线用批评和自我批评的方法，这是十分正确的。几年以来我受到群众的教育，的确获得了一些进步，此后更当向群众学习，接受群众教育，以求更大的进步。尽管思想改造是长期的、艰巨的、反复的，在大跃进形势迫人之下，我认为旧知识分子的思想改造也应当跃进的。党对于民主人士生活的照顾真是无微不至，不应该再有什么生活上顾虑，唯有一面倒地听党的话来改造自己，这样改造就可以跃进了。我的发言是否有当请各位委员指教。
