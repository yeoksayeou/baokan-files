We wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the 1960 National Budget draft, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong’s work report on the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The reports of the two Vice Premiers fully reflect the great achievements the people of the country have made in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Party. All these achievements will lay a solid foundation and reliable guarantee for the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960 and beyond. Furthermore, the leap forward facts of a good start and red successes every month in the first quarter of 1960 repeatedly demonstrate that continued leap forward is an objective necessity for building socialism, thereby further demonstrating that the Party's general line for socialist construction has infinite vitality and shines brightly, guiding the people of the country to leap forward toward a happy and prosperous socialist and communist future. This is the victory of the three magic weapons, the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary vigor promotes the Great Leap Forward in production and construction, and the practice of the Great Leap Forward has tempered the broad masses of cadres and people, making the high tide of socialist construction leap forward wave after wave and forever changing our country's poor and blank state at a rapid pace. Before this meeting, we participated in an inspection and received a profound socialist education, especially the leap forward facts of the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory, which greatly inspired and encouraged us. The process of this factory's development and growth can be said to be a song of triumph for the Great Leap Forward and a beautiful poem of building socialism. Now we will talk about the heroic deeds of innovation and invention created by the workers of the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory and a little of our understanding.

The predecessor of the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory was a balance factory in 1952 that was very poor and could only make wooden steelyards. At that time, the only tool was a pair of pliers, and technically it was almost a blank sheet of paper. However, the Party branch secretary and seven veteran workers used their own efforts and relied on "poor" methods to overcome numerous difficulties. Without machines, they made their own; without technology, they studied on their own. Although the factory buildings were simple and narrow, they produced a large number of equipment. For eight years, they have excellently overfulfilled the production tasks assigned to them by the state every year, accumulating a large amount of funds for the country. This year, they proposed not asking for equipment from outside, not increasing personnel, and manufacturing equipment themselves, so that production volume will increase tenfold compared to last year. Producing a large number of pneumatic tools to meet the needs of mines, their persistent ambition and unyielding spirit of continuous revolution have made this factory continue to develop and grow, and its future is limitless. After visiting this factory, which is known as the "poor stick cooperative" in industry, everyone was infinitely moved.

The "poor stick cooperative" in industry wrote the most glorious page of engaging in industry with poor methods.

Before liberation, under the cruel exploitation of the capitalist system, more than one hundred workers who worked with these seven veteran workers in the pseudo-balance factory died of hunger, cold, and disease. The only seven surviving veteran workers also suffered enough oppression and humiliation when working for the capitalists. After liberation, they not only turned themselves over politically, but their lives also improved day by day. Especially after the Five-Anti Campaign, their class consciousness continued to improve. They often used their past painful experiences under reactionary rule and their happy lives today to help young workers improve their awareness and develop the spirit of being masters of the house and the thrifty habit of cherishing resources throughout the factory.

After 1952, relying on "files plus hard work," without blueprints, they borrowed physical objects to disassemble and imitate metal platform scales. At that time, the quality reached the most advanced level in the country and also met the needs of Kunming City. When the Great Leap Forward began in 1958, with the changes in the situation, it was changed to a hardware factory. All the employees of the factory realized that it was not suitable to engage in hardware appliances with just pliers and files, and it was necessary to increase equipment, but they were unwilling to be beggars. Therefore, they proposed to equip themselves. They bought broken machine parts sold by others as scrap iron for nine cents a catty, pieced them together, and made two six-foot lathes and a small shaper. Because they were pieced together from broken old parts, they swayed and shook as soon as they were turned on. The workers called them "dancing lathes." In 1958, they relied on these "dancing lathes" and "files plus hard work" to welcome the Great Leap Forward and invest in the Great Leap Forward. At that time, the primary task was to produce a large number of wheelbarrows to support the realization of transportation vehicleization in rural areas. Although there was no welding equipment and no large number of machine tools, the Party branch asked the masses to find solutions, and the workers stood up their chests and proposed that wheelbarrows should be made without equipment. They offered suggestions one after another, and finally applied the principle of combining external causes with internal causes to create a lotus-shaped hard mold pig iron water-wrapping method to replace welding and grinding equipment. As a result, the cost was low, the quality was good, and it was greatly welcomed by rural areas. Because the rural areas of the province needed a large amount, the supply of raw materials was temporarily insufficient, so the veteran workers went up the mountains to find iron ore and refractory mud and smelted iron themselves to ensure production. However, in the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, some conservative ideas also appeared in the factory. For example, when steel was being produced during the battle against steel, some conservatives believed that there was no equipment, no technology, and the time was urgent, and they put forward the reason that hard work could not produce steel. The Party branch then called on everyone to debate. The veteran workers used the question, "How was the world's first furnace of steel made? Did the world first have technology before steel was smelted, or was steel smelted first before technology was created?" to refute the "theory of conditions," making everyone realize that the problem can only be learned in the process of doing it. The result of the debate boosted the enthusiasm of the workers. Encountering countless difficulties did not scare them. In the end, they not only produced steel but were also rated as an advanced steelmaking unit in the city and received awards. After the steel battle of smelting steel and training people, the workers became more clear about how to deal with difficulties. For example, veteran worker Xia Yizhi said: "Difficulty is like a spring, depending on how strong you are. If you are weak, it will be hard; if you are strong, it will be weak." Veteran worker Guan Zhengrong said: "Difficulty is like a paper tiger. It is strong on the outside but weak on the inside and will scare people. If you are not afraid of it, it will be afraid of you. Difficulty specializes in bullying lazy people and cowards." Therefore, although there were only three broken machine tools, they mustered up their enthusiasm and responded to the call of the municipal party committee to fight the battle of machine tools. The workers said to those with conservative ideas: "Even without a hen, we must lay eggs." In this way, they created more than 460 units of hoisting machines, shearing machines, electric sawing machines, precision bench drills, etc. They used Mao Zedong Thought to guide production work. For example, when manufacturing hoisting machines, they adopted the method of concentrating major superior forces to solve key problems, dismantling the machine, dividing it into several parts for several people to imitate, and using local materials and adapting to local conditions, using the hoisting machine frame to create a boring eye equipment, solving the difficulty of not having a boring machine. The workers called it "squeezing oil from bones." In 1958, the provincial and municipal party committees rewarded their spirit of revolutionary faction and issued 29 award flags, and they were rated as advanced units in the province and city.

In 1959, the municipal party committee assigned them the task of manufacturing pneumatic tools. They accepted it without hesitation and immediately sent people to the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory to study. What they saw were complete sets of Soviet equipment and hundreds of technicians, while their own factory only had a fourth-grade turner and those old equipment. It was very difficult to make pneumatic tools with precision that was not half a point off. At that time, even the engineers who were invited to guide the technology completely lost confidence and believed that such a factory could not produce pneumatic tools with strict precision specifications, so they shook their heads and left. People with conservative ideas also took the opportunity to lose heart. However, the Party branch organized workers to study, making the workers despise difficulties and face up to the existing problems, analyze them, and mobilize the masses to brainstorm and find solutions. The seven veteran workers thought of the tasks assigned by the Party and said that they must complete them, so they planed and wrote the sign of the pneumatic tool factory overnight and hung it up. The branch called on everyone to use practical actions to oppose right-leaning conservative ideas, and the workers acted and thought, using the theory and ideological method of starting from reality, grasping the main contradictions, and solving key problems in studying Chairman Mao's works, linking them to reality, and applying them concretely. For example, when they first encountered the problem that there was no equipment in the factory to grind the inner circle of the pneumatic pick cylinder, they grabbed the word "poor" to do it. Everyone thought of ways. Regardless of workers and cadres, each person took a pneumatic pick cylinder and used various methods to grind the inner circle of the pick cylinder. Finally, they summarized the experience of grinding with earthen grinding wheels and collectively created an internal circular grinder. After the Party branch made the internal circular grinder, it guided the situation and launched a mass movement to create earthen equipment on a large scale, which also solved the difficulty of not having a large drilling machine of more than two meters. It used a horizontal eccentric shaft to create a hole-drilling machine for drilling 237 mm long eyes, which increased the efficiency of drilling holes 68 times more than borrowing a large drilling machine from another factory, and apprentices could master the operation. There was also no internal hole drilling machine in the factory. Veteran worker Shi Benmin disassembled his watch to observe and imitate the principle of gear rotation to solve the problem of drilling eyes inside the pick cylinder. After the branch discovered this, it immediately supported it and formed a three-in-one group, which successfully developed the internal hole drilling machine in seven days. In the past, it took 40 hours to drill holes and borrow machines from other factories. Now it only takes 15 minutes, and apprentices can master it, and it no longer requires a fourth-grade technician to operate. They did not spend a penny of the country's money and did not ask for a single technician. Relying on the Party's guidance and a spirit of not believing in evil, they equipped themselves with poor methods, made 27 special equipment and more than 300 sets of special tools, molds, and fixtures, so that the equipment for manufacturing pneumatic tools was successfully resolved. In the process of trial-producing pneumatic tools, failures occurred one after another, but under the strong leadership of the Party branch, the workers were educated to recognize that the growth of new things inevitably encounters some difficulties and setbacks and how to correctly treat difficulties, thus inspiring the workers' fighting spirit and finally making pneumatic tools with the quality reaching the prescribed standards. In 1959, four types of pneumatic tools were manufactured, overfulfilling the state plan, and they received 52 award flags from the province and city and gloriously attended the National Congress of Heroes. In the first quarter of this year, they used 24 days to create a five-use universal machine tool for turning, boring, grinding, milling, and drilling. The factory's fixed assets were only more than 100 yuan when it was built in 1952. Because it has always adhered to the policy of self-reliance and running factories diligently and thriftily, it has continued to develop. In 1958 and 1959 alone, it turned over more than 520,000 yuan to the state. The number of people has also gradually increased to more than 260. With the ambition of building a socialist motherland, the pneumatic tool factory has continuously achieved achievements and wrote the most glorious page of engaging in industry with poor methods.

Holding high the three red flags, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the workers are guarantees for achieving major achievements.

The reason why the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory has been able to achieve success and continuous development is mainly because it has been achieved with the strong leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, and holding high the three red flags. In the Great Leap Forward, when there were difficulties, the Party pointed out the direction and gave the methods to solve the problems, so that production and construction could move forward and develop. The case of this factory makes us deeply realize that the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are the lighthouse guiding us to greater and greater victories. We cannot be separated from them at any time or for any matter. For example, after the pneumatic tool failed several times in the experiment, between success and failure, the Party branch timely encouraged and supported the masses not to be intimidated by the difficulties, and finally succeeded. The Party branch of the factory led the workers to study Chairman Mao's works and apply Mao Zedong Thought to specific work to guide everything, which formed a huge invincible force, making production move from one victory to a greater victory. Without the leadership of the Party and the great Mao Zedong Thought, we would lose our way. With the leadership of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, we can continuously achieve leap-forward victories.

At the same time, it is also because the factory has always adhered to the mass line and carried out mass movements on a large scale. They implemented the mass line throughout all their work, mobilized the masses, and fully mobilized their enthusiasm, which not only encouraged the masses' soaring enthusiasm but also provided a reliable guarantee for the smooth completion of production work. The factory implemented the policy of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and carried out mass movements on a large scale, and difficulties were easily solved. Therefore, the cadres said in summarizing their experience: "The mass movement is unforgettable." Only by carrying out mass movements on a large scale can socialist construction leap forward vigorously.

One of the important reasons is also that the workers of the Pneumatic Tool Factory have fully exerted their enthusiasm and creativity. For the sake of distant goals, they have not cared about personal rewards and have worked hard for eight years as if it were one day, enabling production to start from a pair of pliers to continuous development. They have always resolutely listened to the Party, thinking about how to do the job better, how to maximize the satisfaction of the needs of the country and the people, and how to maximize the dedication of their strength to the socialist cause. Therefore, they are always full of vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and drive, shattering and overcoming the heavy difficulties and obstacles on the road forward.

Use Mao Zedong Thought to guide one's actions and constantly strive for fundamental transformation.

Faced with the workers' loyalty to the Party and their selfless labor for socialist construction, looking back on the past ten years under the education of the Party, we have not played a subjective role in actively carrying out self-education and self-transformation. After the anti-rightist rectification, we are still often self-centered. We do not support the three cheers as firmly as the working people do. Our political position and world outlook have not been transformed as they should be and are far behind the development of the situation. We are ashamed of the Party's and the people's earnest expectations and the cultivation and education we have received over the past ten years. From the great achievements made in the leap-forward development of the motherland and from the brilliant examples of the workers in the Pneumatic Tool Factory in production labor, we have further realized that the country's future is infinitely bright, which is very conducive to our fundamental transformation. We must resolutely follow the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, wholeheartedly consider the interests of the country and the people, and do everything for socialism. Learning from the workers starting from reality, we should earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our actions, and constantly strive for fundamental transformation. First of all, in our own work posts, we should learn from the workers' passionate and unrestrained soaring enthusiasm for building socialism and contribute all our strength to the continued leap forward in 1960. We firmly believe that with the leadership and education of the Party and Chairman Mao and the incomparably brilliant socialist beautiful environment, coupled with our own efforts, we will surely be transformed and continue to leap forward forever with the people of the whole country.

    一曲跃进的凯歌
    李呈祥和董仁明委员谈昆明风动工具厂的英雄事迹
    我们衷诚地拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，以及陈叔通副主席所作的全国政协常委会工作报告。从两位副总理的报告中充分反映了全国人民在党的领导下，又取得了社会主义建设事业的伟大成就。所有这些成就，将为1960年以及今后的持续大跃进，奠定了巩固的基础和可靠的保证。又从1960年一季度开门红月月红的跃进事实，一再表明继续跃进，是建设社会主义的客观必然性，从而更进一步显示了党的社会主义建设总路线，具有无穷的生命力，光芒万丈，照耀着指导着全国人民向幸福美满的社会主义、共产主义飞跃前进，这是三大法宝的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    革命干劲推动着生产建设的大跃进，大跃进的实践过程又锻炼了广大的干部和人民群众，使社会主义建设跃进的高潮一浪接一浪地永远持续着，并一日千里地改变着我国一穷二白的面貌。这次会议之前，我们参加视察，受到一次深刻的社会主义教育，特别是昆明风动工具厂的跃进事实，使我们受到极大的启发和鼓舞。这个厂发展壮大的过程，可以说是一曲跃进的凯歌，是一页建设社会主义的美丽诗篇。现在我们谈谈所看到的昆明风动工具厂职工们创造发明的英雄事迹和一点体会。
    昆明风动工具厂前身，在1952年是一个底子很穷只能做木杆秤的衡具厂，当时唯一的工具只有一把老虎钳，技术上几乎完全是白纸。但党支部书记和七位老工人，用自己的努力，靠“穷”办法，来战胜重重困难。没有机器自己造，没有技术自己钻研，虽然厂房简陋狭窄，却制出了大批设备。八年来都出色地超额完成国家每年交给它的生产任务，为国家积累了大量资金。今年提出不向外要设备，不增加人，自己制造设备，使生产量比去年提高十倍。大量生产风动工具，满足矿山需要，他们始终不懈的雄心大志和不折不挠的不断革命精神，使这个厂不断发展壮大，而前途无量。这个被誉为“工业上的穷棒子社”的工厂，在参观以后，谁都受到无限的感动。
    “工业上的穷棒子社”写出了用穷办法搞工业的最光辉的一页
    解放前在资本主义制度的残酷剥削下，和这七位老工人一道在伪衡器厂工作的一百多工人，都由于饥寒病困，死亡殆尽，硕果仅存的这七位老工人，替资本家做活，也是受够了欺压凌侮，万苦千辛。解放后不仅在政治上翻了身，生活也日益改善。尤其经过五反以后，阶级觉悟不断提高，他们经常用过去在反动统治下的辛酸境遇和今天的幸福生活，帮助青工提高觉悟，养成全厂工人当家作主的精神和爱惜物力的勤俭习惯。
    他们在1952年后，凭着“锉刀加干劲”，没有图纸，借实物来拆开仿造金属台秤，当时质量既达到全国最先进水平，还满足了昆明市需要。1958年大跃进开始，随着形势变化改为五金工厂，全厂职工认识到光凭老虎钳、锉刀，搞五金用具是不适应了，必须增加设备，却又不甘心当伸手派。于是提出自己装备自己，他们用九分钱一斤买来别人当废铁卖的坏机器零件，拼拼凑凑搞成两部六尺车床和一部小牛头刨床，由于是破旧零件七拼八凑的，一开动就摇里晃荡，工人们叫它“跳舞车床”，1958年他们就是凭这几部“跳舞车床”和“锉刀加干劲”，迎接大跃进投入大跃进。当时首要任务是要生产大批小推车支援农村实现运输车子化。尽管没有电焊设备，没有大量机床，可是党支部找群众想办法，工人挺起胸膛，提出没有设备也要制成推车，纷纷建议，最后运用了外因结合内因的道理，搞出了莲花心硬模生铁包水的方法，代替了焊磨设备，结果成本低质量好，大为农村欢迎。由于全省农村大量需要，原材料供应暂时不足，老工人就自己上山找铁矿、耐火泥，自己炼铁，保证了生产。但在大跃进的激流中，该厂也曾出现过一些保守思想，如当大战钢铁时，厂内要炼钢，有保守思想的人，认为厂内无设备，无技术，时间又急促，提出苦干不能炼钢的理由。党支部便号召大家进行辩论，老工人用“世界上第一炉钢是怎样炼出来的？世界上最先有了技术才炼出钢来呢，还是先炼出第一炉钢才有技术？”这样一个问题，驳倒了“条件论”，使大家认识问题是在干的当中才能学出本领。辩论结果鼓起了工人群众的干劲，碰到无数困难并没有使他们吓倒，最后不但炼出了钢还被评为全市炼钢先进单位，受到奖励。通过炼钢炼人的钢铁大战后，工人更明确怎样对待困难，如老工人夏宜之说：“困难像弹簧，看你强不强，你弱它就硬，你强它就弱。”老工人管正荣说：“困难像只纸老虎，外强中干会吓人，你不怕它它就怕你，困难专欺懒汉与懦夫。”所以虽然只有三部破烂机床，却鼓足干劲，响应市委号召，大战机床。工人们对有保守思想的人说：“没有母鸡也要下蛋，”就是这样，他们造出了卷扬机、剪板机、电动锯床、精密台钻等四百六十多台。他们运用毛主席思想来指导生产工作，如制造卷扬机时，采取集中主要优势力量解决关键，将机器拆开，分几个人来仿造一部分，和就地取材因地制宜，利用卷扬机机架搞镗眼设备，解决了没有镗床的困难，工人叫做“将就骨头榨油。”1958年省市委对他们这种革命派的精神，进行奖励，发给奖旗二十九面，评为省市先进单位。
    1959年市委又把制造风动工具的任务，交给了他们，他们又毫不畏缩的接受了，立刻派人到沈阳风动工具厂学习，看到的是整套苏联设备和几百个技术人员，而自己厂内只有一个四级车工和那点旧设备，要做精密度不差半丝的风动工具，是存在着重重困难的，当时甚至连请来指导技术的工程师也完全丧失信心，认为这样的厂搞不出精密度规格严格的风动工具，便摇头扬长而去，有保守思想的人也乘机泄气。可是党支部组织工人学习，使工人藐视困难和正视了存在的问题，加以分析，发动群众大家一齐动脑筋，想办法。七个老工人想到党交给的任务，表示一定要完成，便自刨自写把风动工具厂招牌连夜挂出来。支部号召大家用实际行动反对右倾保守思想，工人们就纷纷动手动脑，用学习毛主席著作中关于从实际出发，抓主要矛盾，解决关键问题的理论和思想方法，联系实际，具体运用。如像首先碰到厂内没有磨风镐镐筒内圆的设备，便抓着穷字来干，大家想办法，不管工人干部，每人手拿一个风镐筒，用各式各样的方法来磨镐筒内圆，最后总结用土砂轮磨的经验，集体创作制成内圆磨床。党支部在制成内圆磨床后，因势利导，掀起大搞土设备的群众运动，又解决了没有两米以上大钻床的困难，而用卧式偏心轴制成打二百三十七米厘长眼的孔打眼机，效率比借别厂大钻床打眼提高六十八倍，学工能掌握操作。厂内也没有内孔打眼的机床，老工人师本民拆了自己的手表来观察模仿齿轮转动的原理，借以解决由镐筒内打眼的问题，支部发现后立即支持，并组成三结合小组，在七天内搞成功了内孔打眼机。过去打眼要四十小时还要到别厂借机器，现在只要十五分钟，而且学工也能掌握，不再需要四级技工操作。他们没有花国家一文钱，没有要一个技术人员，凭着党的指引和不信邪的一股干劲，靠穷办法自己装备了自己，做出二十七台专用设备和三百多套专用工模夹具，使制造风动工具的设备顺利解决。在试制风动工具过程中接二连三的遭到失败，但在党支部的坚强领导下，教育工人认识新生事物的成长总难免会遭到一些困难挫折和怎样正确对待困难，于是鼓舞了群众的斗志，终于制成了风动工具，质量达到规定的标准。1959年造出了四种风动工具，超额完成国家计划，又得到省市五十二面奖旗，光荣出席全国群英会。今年第一季度中他们用二十四天时间，又造出车、镗、磨、铣、钻的五用万能机床。该厂1952年建厂时固定资金只一百多元，由于始终坚持自力更生勤俭办厂的方针，不断发展，仅1958、1959两年上缴国家即有五十二万余元，人数也逐渐增长到二百六十多人，他们抱着建设社会主义祖国的雄心大志，使风动工具厂不断的获得成就，写出了用穷办法搞工业的最光辉的一页。
    高举三面红旗，大搞群众运动，充分发挥工人的积极性，是取得重大成就的保证
    昆明市风动工具厂之所以能够取得成就和不断发展，主要是：由于有了党的坚强领导，坚持政治挂帅，高举起三面红旗所取得的。在大跃进中，当着有困难的时候，党就指出了方向，交给了解决问题的办法，使生产建设向前推进和发展。从该厂事例中更使我们深深体会到党的领导和毛泽东思想的指导是指引我们走向愈来愈大胜利的灯塔，任何事情任何时间都不能须臾分离，如像当风动工具几次试验失败后，在成败之间，党支部及时鼓舞支持，使群众不为困难所吓倒，卒获成功。该厂党支部领导职工，学习毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想应用到具体工作中来指导一切，就形成了一股战无不胜的巨大力量，使生产上由一个胜利走向一个更大的胜利。没有党的领导和伟大的毛泽东思想，就会迷失方向，有了党的领导和毛泽东思想，就能不断的取得突飞猛进的胜利。
    同时也还由于该厂始终坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动。他们把群众路线贯穿在一切工作当中，把群众发动起来，积极性全面充分地调动起来，既鼓舞了群众的冲天干劲，又使生产工作的顺利完成有了可靠的保证。该厂贯彻了“两参一改三结合”的方针和大搞群众运动，困难便迎刃而解。因此干部在总结经验中说：“群众运动是刻骨铭心”，只有大搞群众运动，才能使社会主义建设蓬勃向前飞跃发展。
    重要的原因之一，还由于风动工具厂的工人，充分发挥积极性和创造性，他们为着远大的目标不计个人报酬，八年如一日的艰苦奋斗，使生产由一把老虎钳起家到不断的发展。他们时时刻刻坚决听党的话，所想的是怎样把工作做得更好，能最大限度地满足国家人民的需要，怎样才能最大限度地把力量献给社会主义事业，因此永远充满着旺盛的革命热情和干劲，粉碎和克服了前进道路上重重的困难与障碍。
    用毛泽东思想指导自己行动不断努力求得根本改造
    面对工人对党的忠诚和为社会主义建设的忘我劳动，回顾我们十年来在党的教育下，自己并未发挥主观能动作用，来努力进行自我教育和自我改造。经过反右整风，仍然经常是“我”字当头，对待三个万岁并不是像劳动人民那样坚定不移的拥护，政治立场和世界观还没有得到应有的改造，远远落后于形势的发展，愧对党和人民的殷切期望和十年来对我们的培养教育。从祖国飞跃发展取得的伟大成就，从风动工具厂工人在生产劳动中的光辉榜样，使我们进一步认识到国家前途无限美好，对我们根本改造大为有利，必须坚决遵循党和毛主席的教导，一心一意顾国家和人民利益，一切为了社会主义。学习工人从实际出发，认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来指导自己的行动，不断努力求得根本改造，首先在自己工作岗位上，学习工人热情奔放地建设社会主义的冲天干劲，为1960年继续跃进贡献所有的力量。我们深信，有了党和毛主席的领导教育和辉煌无比的社会主义美境，加上我们自己努力，一定能改造好，同全国人民一道，永远继续跃进。
