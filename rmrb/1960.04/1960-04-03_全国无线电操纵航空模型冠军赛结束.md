Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The 1960 National Radio-Controlled Aeromodelling Championship concluded all its competition events on the 1st.

The championship began on March 25th at the China People's Aviation Club at Liangxiang Airport in Beijing. Three competitions were held, with Shaanxi athletes winning two championships. Liu Mingdao and Jia Xin won the radio-controlled model glider flying championship; Tao Kaode and Gao Guojun won the radio-controlled Class II model airplane flying championship. The radio-controlled Class I model airplane flying championship was won by Ye Xinhu and Xue Yifu from Liaoning.

Radio-controlled aeromodelling activities only began to be formally developed in our country last year. This championship shows that this activity has developed rapidly in our country. Not only were there more units and athletes participating in this competition than in the first national competition held in Beijing in December of last year, but the level has also generally improved. The winners (top six in each category) in the three competitions included male and female athletes from a total of eleven units, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Hunan, and Yunnan.

On the last day of the championship – April 1st, athletes from Shaanxi and other units also performed a wonderful display of self-selected aerobatic maneuvers with radio-controlled model airplanes. They used radio equipment to control the model airplanes to perform "air combat" with two planes chasing each other, as well as aerial photography, dropping parachutes, and releasing smoke screens, which aroused great interest among the audience.

    全国无线电操纵航空模型冠军赛结束
    新华社2日讯　1960年全国无线电操纵航空模型冠军赛，1日结束了全部竞赛活动。
    冠军赛从3月25日开始在北京良乡机场中国人民航空俱乐部举行，先后进行了三项比赛，陕西选手获得了两项冠军。其中获得无线电操纵模型滑翔机飞行冠军的是刘明道和贾鑫；陶考德和高国钧获得了无线电操纵二级模型飞机飞行冠军。无线电操纵一级模型飞机飞行冠军被辽宁选手叶新祜和薛义福获得。
    无线电操纵航空模型活动去年才开始在我国正式开展，这次冠军赛表明这项活动在我国已有了迅速发展。这次不仅参加比赛的单位和选手都比去年12月间在北京第一次举行这项全国比赛时增多了，而且水平也有了普遍提高。这次在三个比赛项目中获得优胜名次（每项取前六名）的就包括有北京、上海、陕西、广东、江苏、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、湖南、云南等共十一个单位的男女选手。
    在冠军赛的最后一天——4月1日，陕西等单位的选手还进行了一次精采的无线电操纵模型飞机自选花样动作表演。他们用无线电设备操纵模型飞机在空中表演了双机追逐进行“空战”和空中摄影、投降落伞、放烟幕等，引起观众很大兴趣。
