    Argentina's Parliamentary Elections
    Argentina Juan German
    Argentina recently held national parliamentary elections. The results of the election clearly demonstrate that the Argentine people strongly oppose the so-called "economic stabilization plan" imposed on Argentina by the International Monetary Fund and the government's repressive measures against the people to ensure the implementation of this plan.
    In the 1958 presidential election, the current ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union, due to its proposal of a democratic and progressive program, won nearly 50% of all votes. At that time, the Argentine Communist Party and the Peronist Party both expressed support for Arturo Frondizi, the presidential candidate of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union. The candidate of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union won the position of national president, the positions of governors of various provinces, the majority of seats in the provincial parliaments, and the majority of seats in the national municipal councils. However, in this election, the party lost 55% of the votes it obtained in 1958 and 20% of its parliamentary seats, as well as the majority of seats in some provincial and municipal councils. This election was only a partial re-election of the Chamber of Deputies; otherwise, the Intransigent Radical Civic Union would have lost the majority of seats in almost all provincial parliaments.
    The Communist Party and the Peronist Party, which were banned from participating in the election, both called on their supporters to cast blank votes "to oppose the deceitful and famine-inducing economic plan." The number of blank votes accounted for 25% of the total votes, exceeding the number of votes obtained by any participating political party. The bourgeois newspapers and political leaders here emphasize that the number of blank votes was less than expected. However, they remain silent about the fact that the propaganda advocating blank votes was prohibited, and many people advocating blank votes were arrested. Due to the implementation of the "Conintes Plan" (National State of Emergency), a terrifying atmosphere threatening public opinion was created, and labor leaders, workers, and even Intransigent Radical Civic Union leaders from the provinces were imprisoned, and trade union offices across the country were searched. Despite this, the working class still cast 2.1 million blank votes. This shows that military measures and suppression cannot intimidate the workers.
    The middle class, fearing that a large number of blank votes might lead to a coup, the establishment of an open military dictatorship, or even a civil war, preferred to vote for some opposition parties that expressed opposition to the "economic stabilization plan" and "opposition to the government." This is the reason for the victory of the People's Radical Civic Union and the Conservative parties of Mendoza, San Luis, and Corrientes provinces obtaining a majority of votes.
    Although the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union still maintained the number of votes it obtained in the 1957 election, an analysis of the voting situation in various regions this time shows that the class composition of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union voters has changed greatly compared to 1957. This year, the Intransigent Radical Civic Union was only supported by some upper-class bourgeoisie and people who benefited from the so-called "economic stabilization plan." Moreover, many of the party's votes were obtained by virtue of its control of the bureaucracy as the ruling party. In addition, some Peronists, disregarding their party's decisions and the interests of the working class, served the Intransigent Radical Civic Union.
    It must be emphasized that all free bourgeois parties, in the election campaign, attacked the "economic stabilization plan," the International Monetary Fund, the oil and electricity contracts signed with US-British monopoly capital groups, the suppression of the working class, election bans, martial law, and states of emergency. The leaders of these parties knew that they had to make such expressions in order to win votes. But at the same time, they also attacked casting blank votes, insisting that doing so "benefits the government." The People's Radical Civic Union obtained the majority of votes from the middle class, which generally supports democratic and anti-imperialist policies. The working class mostly cast blank votes to express their opposition to election fraud; the Communist Party's decision prevented many workers from voting for the Intransigent Radical Civic Union because of the betrayal of certain Peronist elements. Some rural workers, some middle-class people, and progressive group members, especially intellectuals, voted for small parties (such as the left-wing Socialist Party, which adopted the thirteen-point struggle program of the United Labor Movement in its campaign platform), and these parties also expressed opposition to the political and social oppressive system. These votes, together with the blank votes, accounted for more than 50% of the total votes, exceeding the combined votes of the People's Radical Civic Union and the Intransigent Radical Civic Union.
    The election results show that the working class has greatly awakened in the five years since the fall of the Peronist Party government, which had considerable influence in the labor movement. The election results also show the political division of the reactionary groups. That is why they are now talking about the need to establish a proportional election system in the elections. Because this would allow representatives of various bourgeois parties to be in the parliament. Another "solution" they are promoting is the unification of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union and the People's Radical Civic Union, because the reactionaries are increasingly worried about the power of the working class's unified action.
    The results of Argentina's parliamentary elections have also aroused a profound reaction abroad, especially in some Latin American countries with situations similar to Argentina. Most Chilean newspapers, in commenting on the Argentine elections, pointed out that the ruling party's disastrous defeat was a failure of the so-called "economic stabilization policy" that led Argentina to economic bankruptcy. "El Siglo" published an editorial on March 29 entitled "The Lesson of Argentina," saying that Frondizi and his masters (the International Monetary Fund) had just been greatly defeated by the people, even though this parliamentary election was conducted under a state of civil war, military tribunals, and summary judgments. The people's answer to Frondizi was "opposition to the stabilization plan and persecution." The American press was also disturbed by the results of Argentina's election. The "New York Times" said in an editorial published on March 29 that "the results of the Argentine parliamentary elections are disappointing for those who hope that a strong economic stabilization plan will continue to be implemented." It admitted that Argentina's "government's austerity plan implemented under the idea of the International Monetary Fund with American support is quite obviously unpopular...Frondizi's close cooperation with the United States on this plan may have made his situation worse, not better."
    It can be considered that the results of Argentina's parliamentary elections foreshadow that a nationwide movement to safeguard national independence and fight for democracy will soon arrive in Argentina.

### 阿根廷的议会选举

    阿根廷的议会选举
    阿根廷  胡安·赫尔曼
    阿根廷最近举行了全国议会选举。选举的结果清楚地表明，阿根廷人民强烈反对国际货币基金组织强加给阿根廷的所谓“稳定经济计划”以及政府为了保证执行这个计划而对人民采取的镇压措施。
    在1958年的总统选举中，目前执政的不妥协激进公民联盟，由于提出了一个民主和进步的纲领，曾获得将近占全部票数50％的选票。当时，阿根廷共产党和庇隆主义党都表示支持不妥协激进公民联盟的总统候选人弗朗迪西。不妥协激进公民联盟的候选人赢得了国家总统的职位、各省省长的职位、各省议会的多数席位和全国各市议会的多数席位。但是在这次选举中，这个党丧失了1958年所得选票的55％，丢掉了议会席位的20％。以及某些省议会和市议会的多数席位。这次选举只是众议院的部分改选，否则，不妥协激进公民联盟将失掉几乎所有各省议会的多数席位。
    被禁止参加竞选的共产党和庇隆主义党在这次选举中，都号召它们的支持者投空白票“以反对欺骗和使人挨饿的经济计划”。空白票的票数占了总票数的25％，超过任何一个参加竞选的政党所得的票数。这里的资产阶级报纸和政治领袖强调说，空白票票数还不到预期的数目。但是，他们闭口不提这样的事实：进行拥护投空白票的宣传遭到了禁止，许多拥护投空白票的人被捕；由于实行了“科宁特斯计划”（全国紧急状态），造成了一种威胁公众舆论的恐怖气氛，劳工领袖、工人、甚至外省的不妥协激进公民联盟领袖也遭到监禁，全国各地工会办事处被搜查。但尽管如此，工人阶级投的空白票仍然达二百一十万张。这表明了军事措施和压镇是吓不倒工人的。
    中产阶级由于害怕大量空白票可能引起政变，建立公开的军事独裁，甚至引起内战，因此他们宁愿把票投给表示反对“稳定经济计划”和“反对政府”的一些反对党，这是人民激进公民联盟获胜和门多萨、圣路易斯、科连特斯省的保守党派获得多数票的原因。
    虽然，执政党不妥协激进公民联盟仍然保持了1957年选举时所获得的票数，但是对这一次各地区投票情况的分析表明，不妥协激进公民联盟的选民的阶级成分同1957年相比有了很大的变化。今年支持不妥协激进公民联盟的只是一些上层资产阶级和从所谓“经济稳定计划”得到好处的人。而且这个党的许多票是靠了作为执政党掌握了官僚机构而取得的。此外，也因为某些庇隆主义分子不顾自己党的决定，不顾工人阶级的利益，为不妥协激进公民联盟效劳。
    必须强调指出，所有自由资产阶级政党，在竞选运动中都攻击“稳定经济计划”、国际货币基金组织、同美英垄断资本集团签订的石油和电力合同、对工人阶级的镇压、竞选禁令、戒严和紧急状态等措施。这些党的领袖们知道，要赢得选票，他们不得不作出这样的表示。但是同时，他们也攻击投空白票，硬说这样做“有利于政府”。人民激进公民联盟获得了中产阶级的大多数票，中产阶级一般说来是赞成实行民主和反对帝国主义的政策的。工人阶级大部分投空白票，以表示他们反对选举骗局；共产党的决定使许多工人并没有因为某些庇隆主义分子的背信弃义而把票投给不妥协激进公民联盟。部分乡村的工人、部分中产阶级和进步团体分子，特别是知识分子，投了小党派的票（如在竞选纲领中采纳了联合劳工运动的十三点斗争纲领的左翼社会党），而这些党也是表示反对政治和社会方面的压迫制度的。这些票加上空白票，就占总票数的50％以上，超过人民激进公民联盟和不妥协激进公民联盟合起来的票数。
    选举结果表明，自从在劳工运动中有相当影响的庇隆主义党的政府倒台后，五年以来，工人阶级大大觉醒了。选举结果也表明了反动集团的政治分裂。这就是为什么他们现在谈论有必要在选举中建立比例选举制度。因为这样就可使得议会中有各个资产阶级政党的代表。他们宣传的另外一个“解决”办法，就是不妥协激进公民联盟和人民激进公民联盟统一起来，因为反动派越来越担心工人阶级统一行动的力量。
    阿根廷这次议会选举的结果，在国外，特别是在一些情况与阿根廷相类似的拉丁美洲国家中也引起了深刻的反应。智利大多数报纸在评论阿根廷选举时指出，执政党的惨败是把阿根廷引向经济破产的所谓“稳定经济政策”的失败。“世纪报”3月29日以“阿根廷的教训”为题发表社论说，弗朗迪西及其主子（国际货币基金组织）刚刚大败于人民之手，尽管这次议会选举是在实行内战状态、军事法庭和即决判决的情况下进行的。人民对弗朗迪西的回答是“反对稳定计划和迫害措施。”美国报刊对于阿根廷的这次选举结果也感到不安。“纽约时报”在3月29日发表的社论中说，“对那些希望强有力的稳定经济计划继续执行下去的人来说，阿根廷议会选举的结果是令人失望的。”它承认，阿根廷“政府按照国际货币基金组织的主意在美国支持下实行的节约计划，是十分明显地不得人心的……弗朗迪西在这个计划上同美国的密切合作也许使他的处境更糟，而不是更好。”
    可以认为，阿根廷这次议会选举的结果预示，在阿根廷一个全国规模的维护民族独立和争取民主主义的运动不久就将会到来了。
