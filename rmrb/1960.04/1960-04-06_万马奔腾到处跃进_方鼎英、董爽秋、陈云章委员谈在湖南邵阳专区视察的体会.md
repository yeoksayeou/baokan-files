A Myriad of Horses Galloping Forward Everywhere
Committee Members Fang Dingying, Dong Shuangqiu, and Chen Yunzhang Discuss Their Experiences from Inspecting the Shaoyang Prefecture in Hunan

Chairman, esteemed members:

We resolutely support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian; we fully agree with the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. The people's commune system fully demonstrates its unparalleled superiority and powerful vitality.

In mid-March, we went to the Shaoyang area of Hunan for an inspection, visited the people's communes, factories and mines, and also visited several middle schools. Everywhere there was a brand-new atmosphere. Whether in agriculture, industry, culture, or education, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out, on the basis of the great leap forward of 1958, another continuous great leap forward was achieved in 1959. The heart-stirring, tremendous changes and brilliant achievements that we witnessed and heard firsthand were truly exciting. I will now talk about our observations.

    Overcoming Extraordinary Natural Disasters to Achieve Extraordinary Agricultural Harvests

The Shaoyang area has thirteen counties and two cities, seven and a half of which are mountainous counties, five and a half are hilly counties/cities, and only two are plain counties. Last year, it suffered an unprecedentedly severe drought that lasted more than a hundred days, as well as widespread insect plagues, and a few areas suffered from floods and wind disasters. However, the people's communes, having overcome these extraordinary natural disasters, still achieved extraordinary agricultural harvests. For the entire region, the total grain output in 1959 increased by 19% compared to 1958, and by more than 53% compared to 1957. The Shaoyang area has many mountains and little land, and has historically been short of grain. Taking Xinhua as an example, in the past it lacked grain for half a year every year, which was supplemented by grain transported from the lakeside counties. Now, not only can it be completely self-sufficient, but it also has surplus grain every year. Responsible comrades in the county told us that the county's total rice output in 1959 increased by 22% compared to 1958, and, calculated by cultivated area, more than quadrupled the highest annual output before liberation, completely solving the grain shortage problem that had not been solved for more than eight hundred years (Xinhua County has been established for more than eight hundred years). From this point alone, the people's commune fully demonstrates its unparalleled superiority and unlimited vitality. We visited Yangxi Commune. In 1959, the average yield per mu of grain in this commune was 1,035 jin, while in 1957, the average yield per mu was only 380 jin, more than two and a half times higher, and the increase was even greater compared to the years before liberation. The commune-run industry has developed rapidly, on a large scale, and with well-equipped factories, there are eleven such factories. For example, the agricultural machinery factory can not only manufacture threshing machines, rice transplanters, blowers, and iron hammers, but can also make its own lathes. The paper mill produces various types of cultural paper, and by the second quarter, it will modify its machines to make paper and produce various types of high-grade paper. The automated rice mill uses water power entirely, and only four people are needed to manage it, and it can mill 40,000 jin of rice per day. This commune is carrying out the process of rural industrialization and building residential areas. We visited a residential area, which was full of red brick houses, with a total of forty-two buildings, an auditorium that can accommodate four thousand people, health stations, libraries, clubs, and shops, all well-equipped. The place was originally a village, and the houses of the common people were destroyed by the reactionary Kuomintang during that period, but they have not been repaired yet, and the common people do not have the strength to repair them. Today, there are rows of Western-style houses, and in contrast, one cannot help but feel emotional. Commune members said to us: "Hell has become heaven. Without Chairman Mao, without the Communist Party, where would we be today?" We also visited a "March 8th Dining Hall." This dining hall is neatly furnished, the water used is gravity-fed, and the transportation of food is semi-mechanized. In order to control the time and save fuel, a thermometer is installed on the large wooden steamer for cooking rice. By looking at the thermometer, you can know that the rice is fragrant and cooked. The cafeteria has one hundred and thirty-six members, feeding five pigs, and only two female comrades are responsible. The labor efficiency has been greatly improved. This commune has earnestly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and last year it also reclaimed 20,000 mu of wasteland. In terms of fertilizer, an average of 126 jin of lime was arranged for each mu of land, and 400 dan of household and native fertilizer, of which high-quality fertilizer reached 70 dan per mu. In terms of farmland water conservancy, thirty reservoirs and a youth canal have been built, which can basically irrigate by gravity. Only on the other side of a high mountain, there are more than 5,000 mu of rain-fed fields, which used to rely on the weather for food. Now pumps are being installed, the largest of which is 135 horsepower, pumping water from the Yangxi River up the mountain, turning the top of the mountain into a river channel. These rain-fed fields can now be guaranteed against drought and waterlogging, and achieve comprehensive harvests. The masses of peasants are truly daring to think and daring to speak, and their enthusiasm is soaring. Their ambition is to conquer nature and quickly change the face of the motherland.

    Industrial Production Achieving a Comprehensive Leap Forward, with Continuous Growth in Output Value

In the Shaoyang area, industry is also making a comprehensive leap forward. In 1959, the state plan was completed forty-five days ahead of schedule. The total industrial output value in 1959 increased by 1.3 times compared to 1958, and by 2.5 times compared to 1957. This year, it has achieved even more of an "opening red," "monthly red," and "overall red," and all factories and mines are carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation in combination with production, carrying out high-efficiency competitions, and gradually realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. The Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which we visited, is a product of the Great Leap Forward. The workers of this plant built a three-story building with a mixed structure in thirty-one hours. A 255-cubic-meter blast furnace was built in only forty-three days (the state-set construction period target was seventy days). They built four similar 45-meter-high brick chimneys, and the construction team and equipment did not increase, but the construction speed was faster than the others. The first project took fifteen days; the second took thirty-six hours; the third took nineteen hours; and the fourth took only twelve and a half hours, which is truly a miracle. The Shaoyang City Paper Mill has been reformed in the drying process. Originally, each square meter could only dry 7 kilograms per hour, and in 1957 it could only dry 15 kilograms, but last year it reached 39.15 kilograms. We also visited the Xinhua Tin Mine, where, like other parts of the country, it is developing and changing at a high speed. The output of antimony is increasing every quarter, and the technical indicators are rising every month. Silicosis, which had never been solved in history and seriously threatened the lives of workers, has been basically solved through prevention and treatment last year.

    Great Development in Cultural, Educational, and Scientific Research Work

On the basis of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, there has also been great development in cultural and educational undertakings. The Shaoyang area established a teachers college and a medical college in 1958, which did not exist before the Great Leap Forward. The number of high school students in 1959 increased by more than one time compared to 1958, and by more than two times compared to 1957. The same is true for the increase in the number of junior high school students. We visited Shaoyang City No. 2 Middle School, Xinhua County No. 1 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, and the County Teachers College. These schools have made outstanding achievements in serving proletarian politics through education and combining education with productive labor. They have done a good job in the three-way combination of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. Students helping communes, factories, and streets with voluntary labor has already been regarded as a part of their academic subjects, and they have gradually developed a noble communist style. Therefore, they are very active in accumulating fertilizer, repairing roads, carrying goods, building water conservancy projects, and other support for industrial and agricultural production labor. After participating in labor, they have a more profound understanding of some specific problems during class, and they realize the importance of certain knowledge in production practice, and they are particularly easy to understand. Through labor and scientific research, their teaching quality has improved, and in each school, only a very small number of students fail, while more than 80% of the students are excellent.

    The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes Have Become Invincible Weapons for Our People to Carry Out Economic Revolution, Political Revolution, Ideological Revolution, Technical Revolution, and Cultural Revolution

Based on the above facts, we have gained a further understanding of the following two issues.

    1. In the past, some people suspected whether high speed and the Great Leap Forward could develop indefinitely and without limitation. We believe that this suspicion is unfounded. It should be known that the soul of the general line is high speed. Without high speed, how can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results? Just the rapid development of the communes and industrial and mining enterprises that we have seen this time, such as the many facts mentioned above, provide a powerful response to these doubters. In our Great Leap Forward, we must work hard on the one hand, and work skillfully on the other hand. Skillful work means carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. Technical innovation is endless, and the Great Leap Forward is also endless. Of course, more importantly, we should realize that the reason why our country has achieved unprecedented Great Leaps Forward in the past and present, and will continue to achieve greater leaps forward year by year in the future, is determined by the superior socialist system; the correct leadership of the Party; the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought; and the Party's ability to mobilize all possible positive factors and give full play to the subjective initiative of all the people based on the opinions of the masses. Therefore, it can promote the endless role of the superior socialist system, and the national economy will continue to leap forward without end.

    2. Right-leaning opportunists say that high speed and the Great Leap Forward will cause imbalances in the national economy. This statement is of course wrong. High speed and proportionality are not two absolutely opposing things. There are contradictions between them, but they also promote each other. They are a dialectical unity. The Xinhua Tin Mine has implemented the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward. From the past single production of antimony products, it has developed into a diversified and comprehensive enterprise, opened up iron concentrate mines, started coal mines, and built cement sections. In this way, various undertakings are linked to each other to promote each other and develop together. These examples powerfully refute the absurd saying of right-leaning opportunists that high speed cannot be proportional and proportionality cannot be high speed. It must be pointed out that the development of our national economy is a planned development, that is, a proportional development. The whole country is a chess game, and it is by no means an anarchic state. People who do not understand this issue view socialist undertakings with a bourgeois eye. Their fallacies are not worth refuting, and they will not cause the slightest damage to our great socialist cause.

In short, after the great practice of two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes have become invincible weapons for the people of all ethnic groups in our country to carry out economic revolution, political revolution, ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution. With these three magic weapons, we have won the Great Leap Forward in the past and present; similarly, with these three magic weapons, we will win even greater leaps forward in the future. Thousands of articles, thousands of plans, as long as we firmly rely on the absolute leadership of the Party and carry out mass movements on a large scale, we will definitely be able to successfully complete and overfulfill this year's plan for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in the national economy with brilliant results, and will also be able to, in not too long a time, build our country into a great socialist country with highly-developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and technology. Moreover, it will continue to leap forward at a high speed, transitioning from socialist society to communist society.

    万马奔腾到处跃进
    方鼎英、董爽秋、陈云章委员谈在湖南邵阳专区视察的体会主席、各位委员：
    我们坚决拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告；完全同意陈叔通副主席的工作报告。人民公社制度充分显示了它的无比优越性和强大生命力
    3月中旬，我们曾到湖南邵阳地区进行视察，参观了人民公社，又参观了工厂和矿区，还参观了几个中学，到处都是一片崭新的气象，无论农业、工业、文化教育各方面，正如李富春副总理所指出的，都在1958年大跃进的基础上，又实现了1959年的继续大跃进。我们亲眼看到、亲耳听到的那些动人心弦的巨大变化，辉煌成就，实在令人兴奋。我现在谈谈我们的观感。
    战胜特大自然灾害获得农业特大丰收
    邵阳地区有十三县两市，七个半是山区县，五个半是丘陵县、市，只有两个是平原县。去年遭受了空前严重持续到一百多天的大旱灾，普遍遭受了虫灾，少数地区还遭受了洪灾和风灾；但各个人民公社，在战胜了特大的自然灾害的情况下，还获得了农业生产的特大丰收。就全区说，1959年粮食总产量，比1958年增长19％，比1957年增长53％以上。邵阳地区，山多田少，历年缺粮，以新化来说，过去每年要缺半年粮食，是由滨湖各县运粮补足，现在不仅可以完全自给，且年有余粮。县里的负责同志告诉我们，全县1959年的稻谷总产量，比1958年增加22％，比解放前最高年产量，按照耕地面积计算，增加四倍以上，彻底解决了八百多年没有解决的缺粮问题（新化开县已八百多年）。单就这点来看，人民公社就充分显示了它的无比优越性和无限生命力。我们参观了洋溪公社，这个社，1959年平均亩产粮食是一千零三十五斤，而1957年平均亩产量只有三百八十斤，翻了两番半还多，比解放前那年增加的倍数更大。社办工业，发展很快，规模较大，设备较好的厂子有十一个，譬如农业机械厂，不仅可以制造打谷机、插秧机、鼓风机、打铁机等，而且可以自制车床。造纸厂生产各种文化用纸，到第二季度，就改装机器造纸，可生产各种高级纸张。自动化碾米厂，全部利用水力，只要四个人管理，每天可碾谷四万斤。这个社，正在进行田园化，建筑居民点。我们参观了一个居民点，是一色的红砖洋房，共有四十二栋，一个礼堂可容四千人，保健站、图书馆、俱乐部、贩卖部，样样俱全。那块地方，原来是村庄，老百姓的房屋，还是反动派国民党时期炸毁的，迄未修复，老百姓也没有力量修复，今天洋房林立，对比之下，感慨万千。社员们对我们说：“地狱变成了天堂，不是毛主席，没有共产党，我们那有今天”。我们还参观了一个“三八食堂”，这个食堂，陈设整洁，用水是自流化，饭菜运送是土机械化，为了控制时间，节省燃料，在蒸饭的大木甑上，装上一个温度表，看看温度表，就可知道饭已香熟。食堂有一百三十六个成员，喂了五头猪，设有小贩部，只有两个妇女同志负责，劳动效率提高不少。这个社，对农业“八字宪法”是认真执行的，去年还开了荒地两万亩。以肥料来说，每亩田平均安排了一百二十六斤石灰，家肥和土肥四百担，其中优质肥料每亩达七十担。农田水利方面，修了三十个水库，一条青年运河，基本上可以自流灌溉。只是在一个高山的另一边，有五千多亩天水田，过去靠天吃饭，现正加装抽水机，最大的有一百三十五马力，由洋溪河抽水上山，把山顶变成河道，这些天水田，今后可保水旱无忧、全面丰收了。农民群众真是敢想敢说，干劲冲天，他们的雄心壮志，是要征服自然，迅速地改变祖国山河面貌。
    工业生产全面跃进，产值连年增长
    邵阳地区，工业方面，同样是全面跃进。1959年提前四十五天完成国家计划，工业总产值，1959年比1958年增长一点三倍，比1957年增长二点五倍。今年更是做到了开门红、月月红、满堂红，各个厂矿，都在结合生产大闹技术革命和技术革新，开展高工效竞赛，逐步实现机械化半机械化，自动化半自动化。我们参观的涟源钢铁厂，是大跃进的产物，这个厂的职工，以三十一个小时，建成一栋混合结构的三层楼房。只有四十三天建成二百五十五立方米高炉（国家所定的工期指标是七十天）。他们建筑四座同类型的四十五米高的砖烟囱，施工队伍和设备，都没有增多，但建筑速度，一个比一个快，第一座工期十五天；第二座三十六小时；第三座十九小时；第四座仅用了十二个半小时，真是奇迹。邵阳市造纸厂，在烘干工序上，有所改革，原来每小时每平方米只能烘干七公斤，1957年还只能烘干十五公斤，去年达到三十九点十五公斤。我们还参观了新化锡矿山，这里也和全国各地一样，在高速度的发展和变化着。锑的产量，季季增大；技术指标，月月上升。历史上从来没有解决的、严重威胁工人生命的矽肺病，通过防、治两条途径，去年已基本上得到了解决。
    文化教育和科学研究工作有很大发展
    在工农业生产大跃进的基础上，文化教育事业，也有很大的发展。邵阳地区1958年建立了师专、医专各一所，大跃进以前是没有的。高中学生，1959年比1958年增长一倍多，比1957年增长两倍多。初中学生亦是同样增加。我们参观了邵阳市二中，新化县一中、八中和县师，这些学校，在教育为无产阶级政治服务，和教育与生产劳动相结合各方面，都做出了优异的成绩。他们对教学、科研、生产劳动三结合的问题，都做得很好，学生帮助公社、工厂和街道搞义务劳动，已经认为是他们学科中的一部分，逐渐养成了高尚的共产主义风格。所以他们在积肥、修路、搬运、兴修水利以及其他支援工农业生产劳动中，都是非常积极。他们参加劳动之后，有些具体问题，在上课学习时，就有了比较深刻的体会，并认识到某些知识在生产实践中的重要性，而特别易于领会。通过劳动和科研，他们的教学质量提高了，各个学校，不及格的学生，只是极个别的；而优良学生，却占了80％以上。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社已经成为我国人民进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、技术革命和文化革命的无往不胜的武器
    根据上面这些事实，使我们在下面这两个问题上，有了进一步的认识。
    一、过去有人怀疑，高速度、大跃进，能不能无止境地无限制地发展下去？我们认为这种怀疑，是毫无根据的。应该知道，总路线的灵魂是高速度，不要高速度，如何做到多快好省呢？单就这次我们所看的公社和工矿的飞跃发展，如上面所举的许多事实，就给这些怀疑者以有力的回击。我们搞大跃进，一方面要苦干，另一方面还要巧干，巧干就是要搞技术革新和技术革命，技术革新是无止境的，大跃进也是无止境的。当然更重要的，我们应该认识到，我们国家过去和现在其所以能够获得史无前例的大跃进，今后将不断地获得一年比一年更大的跃进，是决定于优越的社会主义制度；是党的正确领导；是毛泽东思想的光辉照耀；是党善于根据群众的意见，大搞群众运动，调动了一切可以调动的积极因素，发挥了一切可以发挥的人们的主观能动力量。因而又可促使优越的社会主义制度，无穷无尽地发挥作用，国民经济也就永无止境地持续大跃进。
    二、右倾机会主义分子说，高速度、大跃进，会使国民经济比例失调。这种说法，当然是错误的。高速度与按比例，并不是两个绝对对立的东西，它们之间有矛盾又相互促进，是辩证的统一。新化锡矿山，贯彻以钢为纲全面跃进的方针，由过去的单一的锑品生产，已向多种经营的综合性企业发展，开辟了铁精矿场，开办了煤矿，建成了水泥工段等等。这样各项事业就连带地互相促进，共同发展起来了。这些事例，就有力地驳斥了右倾机会主义分子说什么高速度就不能按比例，按比例就不能高速度的荒谬说法。必须指出，我们的国民经济的发展，是有计划的发展，也就是按比例的发展，全国一盘棋，绝不是无政府状态的。不理解这个问题的人，是以资产阶级的眼光，去看社会主义的事业，他们的谬论，是不值得一驳的，对我们伟大的社会主义事业来说，更无损于毫末。
    总而言之，经过1958、1959两年连续大跃进的伟大实践，总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝，已经成为我国各族人民进行经济革命、政治革命、思想革命、技术革命和文化革命的无往不胜的武器。有了这三大法宝，我们赢得了过去和现在的大跃进；同样，有了这三大法宝，我们将会赢得今后的更大跃进。千条万条，千计万计，只要我们坚决依靠党的绝对领导，大搞群众运动，我们就一定能够以辉煌的成果，胜利地完成和超额完成今年国民经济更大更全面的跃进计划，也一定能够在不太长的时间，把我国建成一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学技术的伟大的社会主义国家。而且仍将不断地高速度地继续向前跃进，由社会主义过渡到共产主义社会。
