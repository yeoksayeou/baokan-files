Comrade Chairman, fellow comrades:
　　I am honored to participate in the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 State Budget. I also listened to Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee at the Third Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I fully agree with and resolutely support their implementation. Now, allow me to share my initial understanding of the policy of combining service and transformation for intellectuals in recent years:
　　Engaging in any work requires putting politics in command
　　I am an educator who has served in colleges and universities for over forty years. Because I lived under the rule of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time, the political darkness and social disorder made me disgusted with everything. I only focused on teaching, ignoring external affairs, detaching myself from reality, politics, and the masses. My circle of life became narrower and narrower. After liberation, I felt that the social environment had completely changed, and there had been significant changes in politics. I also changed my past "aloof" thinking of not asking about politics or participating in political parties. I resolutely joined the China Democratic League, hoping to receive socialist education and have the opportunity for political training. Therefore, I served as the Deputy Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and the Deputy Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee.
　　In 1957, the whole country launched the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle. I was elected as the leader of the rectification leading group of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League. At that time, I felt that as a member of the League, and one of the persons in charge of the provincial committee, it was necessary to lead the comrades in a resolute struggle against the rightist elements within the League, and to correct the political and organizational lines of the League. I had to shoulder this arduous responsibility.
　　In 1958, the Provincial Congress of League Members was convened, and the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League was elected and organized. I was again elected as the Chairman. Since taking office, I have needed to spend a certain amount of time attending relevant meetings and often had to go to the organization to handle necessary work; social activities have also increased as a result, so that the teaching and scientific research tasks I undertook in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University often could not be completed on schedule. Therefore, I believed that there were irreconcilable contradictions between politics and business, and that teaching and League affairs were simply impossible to balance. In this way, I mistakenly opposed politics and business.
　　During the summer and autumn of that year, through teaching reform and the criticism of academic thought, I felt that there were still many problems in my academic thought and teaching work; and I also believed that participating in more political activities affected my research in business. Therefore, I more urgently wanted to resolve these two irreconcilable contradictions between politics and business. I was troubled by this problem for quite some time.
　　Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, a new situation of the Great Leap Forward emerged in this year, and the people's commune movement vigorously developed in the countryside. From August to September, I followed the visiting group of the Jiangsu Provincial Political Consultative Conference to visit Yancheng and Yangzhou prefectures in northern Jiangsu. I personally saw the broad masses of peasants, under the leadership of the Party, full of spirit, high in morale, actively producing, and working tirelessly. Their socialist and communist awareness greatly improved, which made me very moved. I felt that my bourgeois ideology centered on the individual was exceptionally ugly in comparison, and I should learn the noble qualities of the working people. In December of winter, I also participated in the Third National Congress of the League. The situation education gave me great encouragement. I began to realize that any work must "put politics in command." Only when politics is in command can all difficulties be resolved. At the same time, I initially realized that the past emphasis on the contradiction between politics and business was standing on the position of bourgeois individualism, thinking about everything for myself, and a serious mistake of not correctly resolving the relationship between the individual and the collective, which should be quickly overcome. However, because I have not truly solved this problem in the allocation of time, it has caused me great spiritual distress.
　　It was not until the autumn of last year that, through the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, I realized that although I had always expressed sincere support for the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the three red banners of the People's Communes, judging from the erroneous views exposed by many comrades in their studies, and in connection with my own thoughts, it was not absolutely without problems. For example, I also believed that implementing the general line was mainly a matter of industrial and agricultural production, and had little to do with cultural and educational undertakings. Industrial and agricultural production can set high targets and leap forward at high speeds; cultural and educational undertakings should proceed step by step, and haste makes waste. Regarding urban people's communes, which are related to our daily lives, I was even more full of concerns. Some of these erroneous ideas and unnecessary concerns were problems of understanding, and some were problems of stand. From this, I felt that if I did not overcome bourgeois individualism and solve the problem of world outlook, my understanding would lag even further behind the development of the objective situation. This was all because I had not paid attention to political study in the past, and always emphasized the contradiction between politics and business; in fact, it still reflected the essence of my bourgeois ideology of emphasizing business and belittling politics.
　　Attending Party rectification studies and teaching inspections provided a profound education
　　After the Jiangsu Provincial Political Consultative Conference's study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party came to a preliminary end, I returned to the school and attended several Party rectification studies and teaching inspections in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University, which gave me a more profound education.
　　In the Party's rectification studies, I heard three Party member comrades review their mistakes of departing from individualism, some wanting to achieve something in business, some wanting to open courses, and some wanting to become famous and established, leading to neglecting political tasks and seriously committing the error of being detached from three aspects. The Party made serious criticisms of them. Hearing these reviews and criticisms, I was truly terrified, as if I saw my own image in the mirror. The problems they committed could all be found in me; now that the Party criticized them unambiguously with the standards of Party members, it showed how strict the Party's requirements for Party members were, and how serious they were! This moved me greatly. And I realized how far I was from the Party's requirements, and that I must face up to the problems existing in my thinking and continue to strengthen my transformation in order to continue to study and transform seriously with the Party members.
　　Then, in the teaching inspection of all teachers and students in the department, the students made a comprehensive summary of the teaching achievements of each course. They first checked their own learning attitudes, methods, and gains, with relatively strict requirements and relatively detailed analysis; then they pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of each teacher's teaching separately, based on facts, and evaluated them relatively correctly. They did not first pursue quantity in my course "Yuan Dynasty Zaju," but focused on putting forward opinions on teaching quality. They believed that since I had a relatively correct stand and point of view in the past year, I was able to conduct a more in-depth exploration of the analysis and criticism of the characters, stories, plots, and structures in Yuan Zaju, and have my own opinions; and I could also quote the works of various writers in detail for comparative research, which was enlightening to them. The lectures were written in conjunction with scientific research, and the quality was also relatively high. It was just that the planning was not enough, and the teaching task could not be completed; there was not enough connection with new literary and artistic theories; and the systematic nature of the lectures was not enough; I had not paid attention to increasing or decreasing chapters in order to make the content of the teaching materials appropriate in detail. After listening to this, I truly felt "overwhelmed by favor."
　　Only by transforming one's thoughts can one better engage in teaching and scientific research
　　I checked myself, where did these achievements come from? Obviously, they still came from the political aspect. Because through teaching reform and criticism of academic thought, I realized that teaching literature and art should put politics first, and I can no longer use the bourgeois literary and artistic viewpoints of formalism, aestheticism, and interest-ism to teach; I must treat classical dramas seriously and conduct historical materialist analysis. In particular, because I have participated in political theory study and social practice in recent years, and gradually improved my level of ideological understanding, I can preliminarily use the method of class analysis to analyze and study ancient dramas from the correct viewpoint and position. Due to ideological transformation, I can better engage in teaching and scientific research.
　　Before the winter vacation, at the end of the semester, I asked the students to write an after-school reflection to check their learning results. Among the more than 60 students in the fourth-grade class who took this course, more than one-third of the students wrote their learning experiences with their own opinions and a certain quality; unlike in the past, they just copied the lectures and said what others said. Moreover, in their experiences, there were many opinions that I should adopt; and I wanted to consider and rewrite my lectures. After being educated by this fact, I suddenly realized that the "teaching benefits both the teacher and the student" proposed by the Party is completely correct. It should be admitted that in socialist universities, teachers should be active and take the leading role, while the relationship between teachers and students is equal and comradely. In the implementation of "three combinations," teaching can "benefit both the teacher and the student."
　　Now, I deeply realize that teaching and scientific research are both serious political tasks. If we cannot put politics in command, we cannot play a leading role in teaching, nor can we achieve the effect of teaching benefiting both the teacher and the student in teaching. And politics and business must be unified. Only by using politics to guide business and business to embody politics can this contradiction be completely resolved. Only when we truly understand that participating in political study and social practice does greatly help to improve business skills can we make appropriate arrangements in time to better resolve this contradiction.
　　Demanding of oneself according to the standards of a Party member
　　This semester, under the leadership of the Party, the teachers and students of the Chinese Department of Nanjing University are combining to carry out scientific research on a large scale. I have been assigned to the Drama Research Office and must complete the first drafts of "Introduction to Yuan Drama" and "History of Yuan Music" within two years. The task is relatively arduous. In the past, I would have required ample time to write calmly. Now, teachers and students must combine to engage in collective writing, which presents many problems for us old intellectuals. Because bourgeois intellectuals used to regard knowledge as private property. Therefore, they regarded it as mysterious, conservative, with narrow sectarian views, dividing into sects, entering as masters and leaving as slaves, regarding it as a secret only they could obtain, and unwilling to make it public easily. This was the accumulation of scholars in feudal society, and in capitalist society, it has increased monopoly and business, and further regarded knowledge as the capital for writing, selling copyrights, and enjoying the honor of experts. Asking him to give knowledge to the people is still unwilling and calculating. Now the Party has repeatedly instructed us that the combination of teachers and students can fully exert the wisdom and strength of the masses, cooperate with each other, and work hard to overcome any difficulties. Therefore, I have the determination and confidence to complete this writing task. In this way, the process of serving earnestly is also the process of accelerating transformation.
　　Here, I realize again that for the great cause of socialism and communism, the Party hopes that we will actively serve and contribute all our wisdom and strength. Although we have made certain progress in ideological understanding and have certain performance in our work under the Party's continuous teaching, we still cannot fully meet the requirements of the objective situation for us, and we must further implement the policy of combining service and transformation, actively serve, and strengthen transformation. To truly achieve continuous leaps forward in work and continuous revolution in thought, the most fundamental key is still the issue of the transformation of stand and world outlook. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works in the future. In particular, the study of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, to arm our minds with Marxism-Leninism, and actively participate in social practice, and constantly improve our ideological level and business level. We must also demand of ourselves according to the standards of a Party member, study the Party Constitution, Party history, study the Party's mass line working methods, study the noble qualities of Party members wholeheartedly serving the people, and contribute all our wisdom and ability to the great cause of socialism and communism.
　　The above is my preliminary understanding of the policy of combining service and transformation. If there is anything inappropriate, I hope that the committee members will criticize and correct me.

### 不断进行思想革命缩短改造过程  陈中凡委员的发言

专栏：

    不断进行思想革命缩短改造过程
    陈中凡委员的发言主席、各位同志：
    我这次光荣地参加了中华人民共和国第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，听取了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告，又在中国人民政治协商会议第三届第二次会议，听取了陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会的工作报告，表示完全同意，并坚决拥护其贯彻执行。现在容许我把近年来对于知识分子服务与改造相结合的方针作初步体会的发言：
    从事任何工作都要政治挂帅
    我是一个在大专学校服务四十余年的教育工作者。因为长期生活在北洋军阀和国民党反动统治下面，政治黑暗，社会秩序紊乱，使我一概厌弃，只顾埋头教学，不问外事，脱离实际、脱离政治、脱离群众，自己生活的圈子愈来愈狭窄。解放以后，感到社会环境完全改观了，政治上更起了显著的变化。我也就转变了过去不问政治、不参加党派的所谓“清高”思想，毅然加入中国民主同盟，希望接受社会主义教育，得到政治锻炼的机会。因此，曾担任民盟南京市委副主委及江苏省委副主委的职务。
    1957年，全国展开了整风运动和反右派斗争，我被推为民盟江苏省委会整风领导小组长，当时感到作为一个盟员，而且是省委负责人之一，有领导同志们对盟内右派分子作坚决的斗争，并端正盟的政治路线和组织路线的必要，只得负起这个艰巨的责任。
    1958年召开全省盟员代表大会，选举和组织了民盟江苏省委员会，我又被推为主任委员。自从任职以后，既需有一定的时间参加有关的会议，并须经常到组织处理必要的工作；社会活动的时间也由此增繁，以致我在南京大学中文系所担任的教学和科学研究任务，往往不能如期完成。因而认为：政治和业务，有不可统一的矛盾，教学和盟务，实在无法兼顾，就这样，错误地把政治和业务对立起来。
    这年夏秋两季，通过教学改革和学术思想批判，感到自己在学术思想和教学工作上还存在不少问题；而又认为多参加政治活动，影响了对业务的钻研。因此，更迫切地想解决政治与业务这两种不可调和的矛盾。我为这个问题，曾苦恼了不短的一个时期。
    在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，这年中出现了大跃进的新形势，在农村中蓬蓬勃勃地开展了人民公社化运动。8至9月间，我曾随着江苏省政协的参观团，到苏北盐城、扬州两专区参观访问，亲眼看到广大农民群众在党的领导下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，积极生产，不辞辛劳，社会主义和共产主义的觉悟大为提高，使得我非常感动，觉得自己以个人为中心的资产阶级思想，相形之下，异常丑恶，应该学习劳动人民的高贵品质。冬季12月，又参加了盟的第三届全国代表大会，通过形势教育，给我的鼓舞很大。我开始认识到做任何工作，都要“政治挂帅”。必须政治挂了帅，一切困难才可以得到解决。同时，初步体会到，过去强调政治与业务的矛盾，是站在资产阶级个人主义的立场，事事为个人着想，不能正确地解决个人和集体关系的严重错误，应迅速予以克服。但由于在时间的支配上，还未有真正解决这个问题，更使我精神上感到莫大的苦闷。
    直到去年秋季，通过党的八届八中全会文件的学习，又认识到：我对党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，虽然一贯表示竭诚拥护，但从许多同志在学习中暴露的错误看法，联系到自己的思想，也不是绝对没有问题的。例如，我也认为贯彻总路线，主要是在工农业生产方面的事情，和文教事业关系不大。工农业生产可以订出高指标，高速度的跃进；文教事业应该循序渐进，欲速则不达。对于城市人民公社，关系到我们的日常生活，更是顾虑重重，这些错误的想法和不必要的顾虑，有的是认识问题，也有的是立场问题。由此觉得：不克服资产阶级个人主义，不解决世界观问题，自己的认识将会更落后于客观形势的发展。这都由于我过去对政治学习不重视，始终强调政治与业务的矛盾；实际上还是反映了我重业务轻政治的资产阶级思想本质。
    列席了党内整风学习和教学检查受到一次深刻的教育
    及至江苏省政协对党的八届八中全会文件的学习初步告一段落，我就回到学校，列席了几次南大中文系党内整风学习和教学检查，使我受到了更深刻的教育。
    在党内的整风学习中，听到三位党员同志分别检查了他们从个人主义出发，有的想在业务上有所成就，有的想开课，有的想成名成家，以致忽视政治任务，严重地犯了三脱离的错误。党对他们作出了严肃的批判。我听到这些检查和批判，真是毛骨悚然，好像在镜子里看到自己的形象。他们所犯的毛病，在我身上都可以找到；现在党以党员的标准毫不含糊地批判了他们，说明党对党员的要求是如何的严格，又是如何的严肃！这使我受到很大地感动。并且意识到：我和党的要求距离得多远，必须正视自己思想上存在的问题，继续加强改造，才能和党员们共同在一起继续学习并进行认真地改造。
    接着，在全系师生教学检查中，同学对于各门课程的教学成绩作出了全面的总结。他们首先检查自己的学习态度、方法和收获，要求比较严格，分析也比较细致；然后对每个教师的教学，分别指出优点和缺点，实事求是，评价比较正确。他们对我所教的“元人杂剧”一课，并未首先追求数量，而着重在教学质量上提出意见。认为我一年以来由于立场观点比较正确，对于元杂剧中的人物、故事、情节、结构的分析批判，能进行较为深入的探究，有自己的见解；又能详引各个作家的剧作，作比较的研究，对他们有启发作用。讲义是结合科学研究写出的，质量也比较高。只是计划性不够，未能完成教学任务；联系新的文艺理论不够；讲课的系统性也不够；还未能注意增减章节，以求教材内容详略适宜。我听了之后，真感到“受宠若惊”。
    只有改造好思想才能更好地从事教学和科学研究
    我自己检查，这点成就从那里得来？显然，还是从政治方面得来的。由于经过教学改革，学术思想批判，使我认识到讲授文艺，应当把政治性放在第一位，不能再用形式主义，唯美主义及兴趣主义的资产阶级文艺观点进行教学；要严肃认真地对待古典剧目，进行历史唯物主义的分析。特别是由于几年来参加了政治理论学习，参加了社会实践，逐步提高了思想认识的水平，才能从正确的观点立场，对古代剧作，初步运用阶级分析的方法进行分析研究。由于思想改造，才能更好地从事教学和科学研究。
    寒假前，学期结束，我要同学们各写一篇学习后的心得体会，用来检查他们的学习效果。在四年级一班选修这课的六十多人中，有三分之一以上的同学所写的学习心得，能发挥自己的见解，有一定的质量；不像以往只是抄袭讲义，说些人云亦云的话了。而且在他们的心得中，有不少是我应该采纳的意见；并想把我的讲义斟酌加以改写。经过这个事实的教育，我才恍然大悟，党所提出的“教学相长”是完全正确的。应该承认：在社会主义的大学里，教师应该积极主动，发挥主导作用，而师生的关系则是平等的，同志式的，在贯彻“三结合”中，教学是可以“相长”的。
    现在，我更深切地认识到：教学和科学研究，都是一种严肃的政治任务。如果不能政治挂帅，就不能在教学中起主导作用，也不会在教学中收到教学相长的效果。而政治和业务必须统一起来，只有以政治指导业务，业务体现政治，才能把这个矛盾加以彻底的解决。也只有真正体会到参加政治学习和社会实践，对业务水平的提高确有很大的帮助，才能在时间上作出适当安排，更好地解决这个矛盾。
    以党员的标准要求自己
    这学期，南大中文系在党的领导下，师生结合，大搞科学研究。我被分配在戏剧研究室，要两年内完成“元剧概论”和“元曲史”的初稿，任务是比较艰巨的。这在过去，只有要求宽裕的时间，容我从容编写。现在要师生结合，从事集体写作，这在我们旧知识分子又存在不少的问题。因为资产阶级知识分子过去是把知识当作私有财产的。因而把它看成是神秘的，保守的，具有狭隘的门户之见，各分宗派，入主出奴，视为独得之秘，不肯轻易公开。这不仅在天文、数学、律历、古文字、音韵等技术学科方面是这样，就在理论方面，也有所谓“微言大义”，只凭师承授受，秘不示人。这是封建社会文人的积习，到了资本主义社会，又增加了垄断性和营业性，更把知识作为著述的资本，出售版权，并享有专家的荣誉。要他把知识交给人民，还是心所不甘，津津计较的。现在党一再指导我们，师生结合，就能充分发挥群众的智慧和力量，互相协作，鼓足干劲，一定能够克服任何困难。我因此有了决心和信心，来完成这项编写的任务。这样，此后认真服务的过程，也就是加速改造的过程。
    这里，我又体会到，为了社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业，党希望我们积极服务，贡献一切智慧和力量。我们虽是在党的不断教导下，在思想认识上有了一定的提高，在工作上有了一定的表现；但是，还不能完全符合客观形势对我们的要求，还要进一步贯彻服务与改造相结合的方针，积极服务，加强改造。要真正做到工作持续跃进，思想不断革命。其最根本的关键，还是立场和世界观的改造问题。因此，我们今后必须继续加强马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的学习。特别是毛泽东文艺思想的学习，以马克思列宁主义来武装自己的头脑，并积极参加社会实践，不断提高自己的思想水平和业务水平。更要以党员的标准要求自己，学习党章、党史，学习党的群众路线的工作方法，学习党员全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业，贡献出自己所有智慧和能力。
    以上是我对服务与改造相结合的方针的初步体会，是否有当，仍祈各位委员予以批评指正。
