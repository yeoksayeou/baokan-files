Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 13th: The Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" today published a commentary entitled "Factors for Peace in Asia and the World," stating that the Chinese Communist Party faithfully implements the principles of Marxism-Leninism in both its domestic and foreign policies. The commentary stated that the People's Republic of China, with its continuous efforts and various peaceful initiatives, has become a significant factor for peace in Asia and the world. Only those short-sighted politicians who have not learned from history are unwilling to acknowledge this reality. However, whether they like it or not, the People's Republic of China is continuously growing stronger, and its international prestige as a peace-loving great power is undeniable.

The commentary emphasized the proposals put forward by the Government of the People's Republic of China, such as the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression among countries in Asia and the Pacific region, stating that these proposals have made extremely significant contributions to maintaining and consolidating peace. It also stated that the agreements reached on the boundary issues between China and Burma, and China and Nepal, are further examples proving the People's Republic of China's faithful implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The commentary said that recently, the imperialist bloc headed by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys—the Yugoslav revisionists—have taken advantage of certain Sino-Indian border disputes to clamor wildly, attempting to sow seeds of division between the two great neighboring countries of Asia and to discredit the peaceful policies of the People's Republic of China. However, they did not achieve their intended goal. In view of the desire to resolve disputes through negotiations in a spirit of understanding, the Government of the People's Republic of China has taken another major step conducive to peace—a meeting between the two Prime Ministers. We wish this meeting positive results, because such a meeting is conducive to consolidating peace and friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, April 13th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Nida" published an article today, welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to India with the aim of peacefully resolving the Sino-Indian border issue. The article condemned the new conspiracies of international reactionaries attempting to sabotage the meeting between Zhou Enlai and Nehru.

The newspaper pointed out that if China and India, these two friendly neighbors, shake hands in reconciliation after resolving the border issue, it will be a heavy blow to the international reactionaries supported by international imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. The enemies of the Chinese and Indian peoples regard the border issue as a "trump card" in their hands.

The newspaper condemned these international reactionaries for planting landmines everywhere on the road to peace and peaceful coexistence, attempting to amplify the Sino-Indian border issue as well as the dispute between China and Indonesia over overseas Chinese. The newspaper pointed out, "Today's forces for peace are stronger than any force hindering its progress, and no amount of unfounded exaggeration can change any fact." In another article, this newspaper strongly condemned the so-called "Afro-Asian Tibet Conference" held in India prior to the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers. The article pointed out that this conference was organized by influential U.S. authorities and the most reactionary agents they found from some countries. It pointed out that this conference serves the interests of imperialism.

    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”发表评论
    中印总理会晤有助于巩固和平
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”说中印友好是对帝国主义的打击
    据新华社地拉那13日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”今天在题为“亚洲和世界和平的因素”的一篇评论中说，中国共产党不论在对内政策和对外政策上都忠实地执行着马克思列宁主义的原则。评论说，中华人民共和国以它不断的努力和各种和平的倡议，已经成为亚洲和全世界和平的重大因素。只有那些鼠目寸光、还没有吸取历史教训的政客们，才不愿意承认这种现实。但是，不管他们喜欢不喜欢，中华人民共和国正在不断壮大，作为一个爱好和平的大国的国际威望是无可辩驳的。
    评论着重谈到了中华人民共和国政府提出的诸如缔结亚洲和太平洋地区国家互不侵犯条约等建议，它说，这些建议对维护和巩固和平作出了十分重大的贡献。它还说，在中国和缅甸、中国和尼泊尔的边界问题上达成的协议，是证明中华人民共和国忠实执行和平共处原则的又一范例。
    评论说，最近时期，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团和它的仆从——南斯拉夫修正主义者利用了某些中印边界争端而大肆叫嚷，企图在亚洲两个伟大邻邦之间散布分裂的种子，诋毁中华人民共和国的和平政策。但是他们并没有达到预期的目的。中华人民共和国政府鉴于用谅解的精神谈判解决争端的愿望，采取了又一个有利于和平的重大步骤——两国总理举行会晤。我们预祝这次会晤获得积极的成果，因为这样的会晤是有助于巩固和平和友谊的。
    新华社贝鲁特13日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表文章，欢迎周恩来总理抱着和平解决中印边界问题的目的即将访问印度。文章谴责国际反动派企图破坏周恩来和尼赫鲁的会晤的新的阴谋活动。
    报纸指出，中、印这两个友好的邻国如果在解决边界问题后握手言欢，对于得到国际帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义支持的国际反动派来说，那将是一个沉重的打击，中印两国人民的敌人把边界问题当作他们手里的一张“王牌”。
    报纸谴责这些国际反动派在和平与和平共处的道路上，到处埋置地雷，他们企图扩大中印边界问题以及中国和印度尼西亚在华侨问题上的争端。报纸指出，“今天的和平力量比阻挠它前进的任何力量都更为强大，没有任何根据的夸大丝毫不能改变任何事实”。这家报纸在另一篇文章中强烈谴责在中印两国总理会晤以前在印度举行的所谓“亚非西藏会议”。文章指出，这个会议是由有影响的美国当局和它从一些国家中找来的最反动的代理人组织起来的。它指出这个会议是为帝国主义的利益服务的。
