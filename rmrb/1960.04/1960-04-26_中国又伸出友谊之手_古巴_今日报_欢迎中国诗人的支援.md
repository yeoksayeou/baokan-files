Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 24th. "Hoy" published a commentary today saying, "From a great country, China—whose Chairman and revolutionary leader is a poet—came the funds donated by poets at the initiative of Rafael Alberti and Nicolás Guillén to purchase the 'Poetry Plane'."

"Hoy" emphasized, "This is another friendly action and recognition of the Cuban Revolution from the heart of the new Asia. China has once again voiced her support and extended a hand of friendship. This action means that Cuba is not isolated in its just struggle for national independence and national honor." "Hoy" concluded, "Thus, the 'Poetry Plane' demonstrates that art and revolution are united in the monument to the friendship between the Latin American and Asian peoples fighting against colonialism and for human happiness."

Note: More than 300 well-known Chinese poets and literary figures responded to the initiative of Alberti and Guillén and held a poetry and literary meeting on the 20th to support the Cuban people. At the meeting, it was announced that poets and related organizations across the country had donated a total of 25,000 yuan.

    新华社哈瓦那24日电　“今日报”今天发表评论说，“从一个伟大的国家，中国——她的主席和革命领袖就是一个诗人——送来了诗人们根据拉斐尔·阿耳贝蒂和尼古拉·纪廉的倡议捐购‘诗歌号飞机’的款项。”
    “今日报”强调说，“这是从新生的亚洲的中心来的对古巴革命的又一友好行动和对古巴革命的承认。中国再次发出她的声音，再次伸出了友谊的手。这一行动意味着古巴在争取民族独立和国家荣誉的正义斗争中不是孤立的。”“今日报”最后指出，“这样，‘诗歌号飞机’就表明，在为反对殖民主义和争取人类幸福而斗争的拉丁美洲和亚洲人民的友谊的纪念碑上，艺术和革命是一致的。”
    按：中国著名诗人和文艺界人士三百多人响应阿耳贝蒂和纪廉的倡议，曾经在20日举行了支援古巴人民诗歌文艺会，会上并宣布，全国各地诗人和有关团体共捐款二万五千元。
