Vigorously Attack the Raw Materials Bottleneck
People's Daily Commentator

The experience of Shandong Province and Baotou Steel in manufacturing and using wet-milled slag concrete is a very important one. This kind of concrete is easy to manufacture, performs well, and costs half as much as ordinary cement. It can be produced wherever there are blast furnaces for iron smelting. According to calculations by relevant departments, if half of the country's iron slag is utilized this year, the wet-milled slag concrete produced will exceed the total planned cement production for the entire year. Currently, cement is a material with relatively tight supply in capital construction. If the experience of Shandong and Baotou Steel is widely promoted, it will undoubtedly ensure that capital construction proceeds more smoothly and at a high speed. This concrete can also be used to manufacture railway sleepers and mine supports, etc., to replace a large amount of timber. Therefore, we hope that all places with the necessary conditions can promote the advanced experience of Shandong and Baotou Steel as quickly as possible.

The supply of cement and certain other raw materials not keeping up with the growth in demand is a new problem brought about by the unprecedentedly good situation on the industrial front since the beginning of this year. The nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement, with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as its main content, has drastically increased the demand for steel, electrical materials, etc. As a result of the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, production in almost all sectors has risen rapidly, and a large number of enterprises have completed their plans ahead of schedule. This has made certain raw materials, which were arranged according to the original production plan, appear insufficient. This situation is a new imbalance, a new contradiction, that has emerged in our high-speed advance, and it is not surprising at all. However, on the other hand, it is indeed a key issue in current production and in the technical innovation movement. This problem must be solved in order to effectively consolidate and expand the achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, so that the achievements of the movement can be fully manifested in production.

What method should be used to solve this key problem? The method is still: vigorously launch mass movements, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. Since the new contradictions have arisen in the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, the solution must also be found among the masses and in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. It cannot be imagined that problems that appear in the majority of people and the majority of enterprises can be completely solved only by relying on a small number of people or a small number of specialized enterprises. Some comrades have not thought this principle through clearly. After production increases, they always hope that the higher authorities will allocate more raw materials to them, and that brother enterprises will provide more support in the form of raw materials. They have not realized that although this is an important source, it is limited. Of course, various raw material production enterprises are also substantially increasing production, but they cannot meet the needs of all enterprises. Therefore, being a "hand-raiser" on the issue of raw materials means taking a slow, costly, and inefficient path. Only by looking inward, relying on our own efforts, and mobilizing the masses to seek raw materials from technical innovation and technical revolution, can we follow a path that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

Is it "dabbling in side occupations" for responsible processing enterprises to produce raw materials, steel plants to produce cement, and machinery plants to smelt steel...? The answer is: we are precisely trying to break down this old concept that uses "scientific division of labor" as an excuse to exclude diversified operations and restrict people's hands and feet. Of course, "specialized division of labor" is necessary at all times, and specialized enterprises are the main force in all industries at all times. However, relying only on a small number of specialized enterprises and walking on only one leg makes it impossible to achieve maximum quantity, speed, quality, and economy. Diversified operations can mobilize the broadest masses and utilize all usable resources to increase the production of raw materials and products. Adopting the principle of combining specialized production with diversified operations can increase social wealth, reduce the burden on specialized enterprises, and help enterprises engaged in "side occupations" to smoothly ensure the completion of their own production tasks. Obviously, this is very beneficial to all parties. We can only judge whether a practice is right or wrong based on one criterion: whether it is conducive to production. It is completely wrong to abandon this criterion and debate the advantages and disadvantages of specialized division of labor and diversified operations from a formal perspective.

The many advanced experiences that have emerged in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in recent months prove that the potential in raw materials is endless, and comprehensive utilization has great prospects. Using wet-milled slag to make cement is just one of thousands of examples. Our country's resources are infinitely abundant. As long as we continue to explore tirelessly and enthusiastically and actively promote existing advanced experiences, we can find more ways to increase production and save raw materials. The experience of Shandong and Baotou Steel is "where there is iron, there is cement." We must also put forward more such slogans: "Where there is coal, there is gas, and where there is gas, there are chemical raw materials," "Where there is wood, there is fiberboard," "Where there is sand and clay, there are pit props," "Where there are wild fibers, there are textile raw materials." All industries should find such slogans to mobilize and organize the masses to promote existing advanced experiences.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, a successful leadership method of many enterprises is to organize battles and concentrate forces in a period of time to "tackle key problems." Now, the raw material issue is a "bottleneck" in the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Let us start this "tackling key problems" battle immediately! We believe that the emergence of this new contradiction, this new imbalance, of raw materials not keeping up with demand, will attract the attention and wisdom of millions of people. Thus, it will not only solve the temporary difficulties of the current shortage of raw materials, but will also bring about a huge development, a huge change, and a brand new situation in raw material production.

    猛攻原料关
    本报评论员
    山东省和包钢制造和使用湿碾矿渣混凝土的经验，是一项十分重要的经验。这种混凝土制造容易，性能良好，成本比一般水泥低一半，凡是有高炉炼铁的地方都可以生产。据有关部门计算，如果今年全国的铁矿渣有一半得到利用，制成的湿碾矿渣混凝土将超过今年全年的水泥计划总产量。目前水泥是基本建设中供应比较紧张的一种材料，如果山东和包钢的经验得到广泛推行，无疑地将会保证基本建设更加顺利地高速度地进行。这种混凝土还可以用来制造铁路枕木和矿井支柱等等，来代替大量的木材。因此，我们希望一切有条件的地方，都能够用最快的速度来推广山东和包钢的这项先进经验。
    水泥等某些原材料的供应跟不上需要的增长，是今年以来工业战线上空前良好的形势所带来的新问题。全民性的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，使钢铁、电气材料等的需要量急剧地增长了。技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃开展的结果，几乎各行各业的生产都迅速上升，大量的企业提前完成了计划，这样就使得某些按照原来的生产计划安排的原材料显得不足了。这种状况是我们在高速度前进中出现的新的不平衡，新的矛盾，是丝毫不足奇怪的。但是，另一方面，它又确实是当前生产中和技术革新运动中的一个关键问题。必须解决这个问题，才能有效地巩固和扩大技术革新和技术革命运动的成果，使得运动的成果在生产上充分地表现出来。
    用什么方法来解决这个关键问题呢？方法仍然是：大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命。新的矛盾既然是技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中产生的，解决的方法也就必然要到群众中，到技术革新和技术革命运动中去找。不能设想，大多数人大多数企业中出现的问题，只依靠少数人少数专业企业而能够得到完满的解决。有的同志没有想清楚这个道理，当生产提高了之后，总是希望上级多给他调拨一些原材料，希望兄弟企业多给他支援一些原材料。他没有想到，这虽然是一个重要来源，但是是有限度的。当然，各个生产原材料的企业也在大幅度地增产，但是它们不可能满足所有企业的需要。因此，在原材料问题上做“伸手派”，走的是一条少慢差费的道路。只有眼睛向内，自力更生，把群众发动起来，向技术革新和技术革命要原材料，才是一条多快好省的道路。
    负责加工的企业生产原材料，钢铁厂生产水泥，机械厂炼钢铁……，这是不是“不务正业”呢？答复是：我们正要破除这种籍口“科学分工”而排斥多种经营的束缚人们手足的旧观念。当然，“专业分工”在任何时候都是必要的，专业企业在任何时候都是各行业的主力。但是，只靠少数专业企业，只靠一条腿走路，就不可能做到最大限度的多快好省。而多种经营可以发动最广泛的群众、利用一切可以利用的资源来增产原材料和增加产品，采取专业生产同多种经营并举的方针，就可以多快好省地增加社会的财富，减轻专业企业的负担，并且有助于搞“副业”的企业顺利地保证完成本企业的生产任务。显然，这无论对哪一方面来说，都是十分有利的。我们判断一种做法对或者不对，只能有一个标准，就是是否有利于生产。抛开这个标准而从形式上来辩论专业分工和多种经营的利弊，是十分错误的。
    几个月来，技术革新和技术革命运动中出现的许多先进经验证明，原材料方面的潜力是无穷的，综合利用是大有可为的。用湿碾矿渣做水泥，只不过是千百个例子中的一个。我国的资源无限丰富，只要我们不畏艰难地继续探索，并且热情地积极地推广已有的先进经验，我们就可以找到更多的增产和节约原材料的方法。山东和包钢的经验是“有铁就有水泥”。我们还要提出更多的这样的口号：“有煤就有气，有气就有化工原料”、“有木材就有纤维板”、“有砂子、陶土就有坑木”、“有野生纤维就有纺织原料”。各行各业都应当找出这样的口号来动员和组织群众推广已有的先进经验。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，许多企业的一条成功的领导方法就是组织战役，在一个时期里集中力量来“攻关”。现在，原材料问题就是当前技术革新和技术革命运动的一个“关”。让我们马上开始这个“攻关”战役吧！我们相信，原材料跟不上需要这个新矛盾，新的不平衡的出现，将会吸引千百万群众的注意力和智慧，从而，不但会解决当前原材料不足的暂时的困难，而且将会使原材料生产出现一个巨大的发展，巨大的变革，和一个崭新的局面。
