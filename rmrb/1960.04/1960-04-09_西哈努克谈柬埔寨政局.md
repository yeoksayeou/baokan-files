Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 8th: Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk delivered a lengthy speech to the Cambodian people on the afternoon of the 7th regarding the issues of royal succession and the Regency Council.

Sihanouk said that since the Coronation Council had not yet been able to decide who should be the new King, it had decided to select a Regency Council to exercise certain powers of the King, pending the election of a new King. He pointed out that the powers of the Regency Council were different from those possessed by the King, nor were they concentrated in the hands of the Chairman of the Regency Council, Prince Monireth. When receiving foreign guests and diplomatic envoys, the Chairman of the Regency Council will represent the King, but in making any decisions, all three members of the Regency Council have equal speaking rights, and at the same time, they cannot live in the Royal Palace. He said that Prince Monireth and he had different political views, but this did not prevent them from working together.

Sihanouk said that the hereditary system of the Cambodian throne had been changed since French colonialists invaded Cambodia. The French could control Cambodia more easily by selecting a docile king from the royal family than through a hereditary prince. He also said that this was the cause of the current difficulties, which, if not handled well, could even lead to civil war.

He said that he had sworn not to be King of Cambodia again, and at least not to allow his son to be King while he was alive. He also said that some members of the royal family and senior figures had suggested that the Queen succeed to the throne, but he personally disagreed, because he believed that once the Queen became the King of Cambodia, many people would try to abuse her name to do evil, and the throne would only be a pit of fire for her. He also said, however, that this was for the people to decide.

### 西哈努克谈柬埔寨政局

    西哈努克谈柬埔寨政局
    新华社金边8日电　柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王7日下午就有关王位的继承和摄政委员会等问题向柬埔寨人民发表了长篇演说。
    西哈努克说，由于加冕委员会还不能决定谁当新国王，它决定选出一个摄政委员会来执行国王的某些权力，以等待选出新国王。他指出，摄政委员会的权力既不同于国王所拥有的权力，也不是集中在摄政委员会主席莫尼勒亲王手中。在接见外宾和外交使节的时候，摄政委员会主席将代表国王，但是，在作任何决定的时候，摄政委员会的所有三个委员都有同样的发言权，同时他们也不能住在王宫里。他说，莫尼勒亲王同他有着不同的政治主张，但是这并不妨碍他们在一起工作。
    西哈努克说，柬埔寨王位的世袭制度自从法国殖民主义者侵入柬埔寨以后就改变了。法国人通过从王室中选出一个驯服的国王比通过一个世袭的王子能够更加容易控制柬埔寨。他又说，这是造成目前的困难的原因，如果掌握得不好，甚至可能引起内战。
    他说，他已经宣誓不再作柬埔寨国王，同时至少在他在世的时候不打算让他的儿子当国王。他又说，某些王室成员和高级人士曾经建议由王后接替王位，但是他个人不同意，因为他认为，一旦王后成了柬埔寨的国王，就会有不少人打算盗用她的名义为非作歹，而王位对她只不过是一个火坑。他又说，但是，这要由人民来决定。
