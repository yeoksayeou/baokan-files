    Barren Wasteland Transformed into Treasure Land
    By our correspondent Wang Chongjie
    After arriving in Hajdú-Bihar County, the easternmost part of Hungary, we first visited the ancient and famous Hortobágy. In the past, this was the largest wasteland in Central Europe, covering an area of more than 200,000 holds, known at home and abroad for its desolation and bizarre stories. After liberation, the Hungarian people overcame natural disasters and completely changed the fate of Hortobágy, transforming it from a barren land into a rich agricultural area.

      Boundless Wasteland
    Wasteland, oh, wasteland,
    Hortobágy's wasteland,
    You are boundless and limitless,
    As vast as the sky.
    Many folk songs of Hortobágy begin like this. But according to historical research, Hortobágy was not originally a desolate wilderness. Before the mid-thirteenth century, many villages were distributed in this area, and the land was very fertile. Later, due to the invasion of the Tatars and Turks, the villages were destroyed, and the forests were cut down or burned. Wind and drought turned large tracts of fertile land into alkaline wasteland over hundreds of years. Later, the Tisza River often flooded, making it uninhabitable. For centuries, only poor herders were forced by landlords to graze their livestock on this wasteland. The herders drove cattle and sheep, wandering around Hortobágy all year round, sleeping in the open air beside their livestock at night.

    After the Tisza River was harnessed in 1840, Hortobágy became even drier. Rainfall was scarce, the soil became increasingly alkaline, and the grassland became more desolate. According to the statistics of 1924, 50% of the area of Hortobágy was barren land, 16% could grow grass, and 30% could not even grow grass in dry weather. In summer, the green grass quickly withered under the scorching sun. Therefore, grazing could only be done here before the scorching summer arrived. As a result, animal husbandry also declined.

    Only the peculiar scenery of Hortobágy still attracted tourists from far and wide. The climate here varied greatly day and night. At night, the bonfires of the herders for warmth flickered on the silent wilderness. At noon, there were mirages—a few small thatched huts, a few trees, and scattered cattle and sheep reflected in the air. It seemed to be telling people: "Look at the pitiful state of Hortobágy, with only so much property on more than 200,000 holds of land…."

    Before liberation, the landlords schemed against each other, each wanting to get more profit from this wasteland, but no one wanted to invest in transforming it. At that time, the rulers of the country made many plans to develop Hortobágy, and wrote many blank checks, but Hortobágy became more and more barren day by day.

      Wasteland Turns into a Treasure Land
    Today, Hortobágy is famous for the miracle of man conquering nature. Look, new villages have appeared on the once-hungry wasteland, rice paddies are connected to wheat fields, herds of fat livestock are everywhere on the green grassland, fish swim in the fish ponds, and new forests are growing. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are all developing vigorously.

    The struggle to conquer Hortobágy began in 1948. The state established five state-owned farms here, and many agricultural experts, workers, and farmers responded to the Party's call and rushed here to carry out large-scale land reclamation and soil improvement work.

    To completely change the face of Hortobágy, it was first necessary to solve the problem of water shortage. To this end, the Eastern Canal, which is 100 kilometers long, was built in Hajdú-Bihar County, and the Western Canal was renovated to divert the water of the Tisza River to Hortobágy. Then an irrigation network was established here, so that the rushing river water began to nourish the depleted and barren land. With the progress of water conservancy construction, the agricultural production of Hortobágy has developed rapidly.

    Last year, the government decided to merge the five state-owned farms originally established into one, in order to better utilize the superiority of large-scale management to develop Hortobágy in a planned way. Comrade Szabo Janos, the chief agronomist of this large state-owned enterprise, enthusiastically introduced the farm's production situation to us in detail.

    The farm has 20,000 holds of cultivated land, half of which has established a complete irrigation network. Last year, it provided the state with 36,000 quintals of wheat, 24,500 quintals of rice, and 62,000 quintals of sugar beets. Due to the improvement of the soil, various crops such as wheat, rice, corn, and tobacco can be grown here. The state has also given Hortobágy a lot of support in terms of machinery. Now there are more than 250 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower) and 11 trucks.

    Animal husbandry has developed unprecedentedly in recent years. Now the state-owned farm has more than 60,000 sheep, more than 3,000 cattle, nearly 5,000 pigs, 700 horses, and more than 40,000 poultry, and provides the state with a large number of livestock products every year. The state-owned farm is also responsible for providing various breeds of livestock to other parts of the country to support the development of animal husbandry nationwide. To ensure that livestock have enough feed, nearly 30,000 holds of pasture have been cultivated. Irrigation is also carried out to the grassland at certain times. Originally, four holds of grassland were needed to feed a cow, but after irrigation, each hold of grassland can feed two cows. Cows grazing on this grassland can increase one kilogram of meat per day, and the milk production of dairy cows is also very high.

    The state-owned farm also has nearly 8,000 holds of artificial fish ponds. This year, it plans to provide the market with 2 million kilograms of fish. Artificial fish ponds are mostly built in areas that are not suitable for cultivation. Building fish ponds in these places can kill two birds with one stone: on the one hand, a large amount of fish can be produced; on the other hand, it can help improve the soil. Experience has shown that after a few years of fish farming, the alkaline soil will undergo great changes. Now the state-owned farm generally adopts the method of three years of fish farming and one year of planting grain. The chief agronomist of the state-owned farm said that in the next few years, the fish ponds will be expanded to more than 25,000 holds.

    In order to change the climate of Hortobágy and prevent wind and sand, the state-owned farm has attached great importance to afforestation for more than ten years. In the past, this bare wilderness now has 2,500 holds of forests. In the next ten years, the area of ​​forests will continue to increase more than two times.

    The agricultural product processing industry is also highly valued. A modern livestock product processing factory has been established here.

    During the second five-year plan, Hortobágy will be further developed in terms of production and construction.

      The Words of the Horse Herder
    When we went to visit the horse farm, it was time to release the horses. A large group of fat and strong horses rushed out of the spacious and tidy stables one after another and ran towards the open space. A middle-aged man skillfully rode on horseback, waving his whip to drive the horses back and forth. The head of the farm told us that this horse herder is the farm's famous horse-raising expert, Szabo Gabor.

    We found Comrade Szabo Gabor and asked him to talk about his experience in raising horses. This horse-raising expert pondered for a while and slowly said: "To raise horses well, you must care for horses like a mother cares for her children, be familiar with the characteristics of each horse, care about their diet, and strictly manage and train them. Raising horses is the same as other work. If you don't love this kind of work, and you don't concentrate on studying and improving, it is difficult to do well…”

    Before Szabo finished speaking, some herders surrounded us. Everyone simply sat on the grass and talked freely. Among these herders were those who raised horses, and those who herded sheep or cattle. Everyone was proud of the work they were responsible for. While talking, the friends who herded cattle sang their songs:

    I don’t regret being born a shepherd boy,
    I don’t regret becoming a cattle herder,
    A beautiful palace cannot replace my puppy,
    I love the ranch and the herd with all my heart…

    This is their ode to their labor. Herders also like to mark their profession in their dress, and the whips they use are all carefully woven by themselves, with beautiful carvings on the wooden handles.

      Old Artist and Violin
    Travelers who come to Hortobágy always go to visit the famous "Nine-Arch Bridge" and by the way, go to the small restaurant by the bridge to taste the delicious dishes that have a long tradition in the local area.

    The "Nine-Arch Bridge" was built in 1827, is 167 meters long, and is the longest stone bridge in Hungary. The small restaurant next to the bridge was built in 1781. Now this restaurant has an entertainment room in addition to the dining room. After a day of work, the herders often like to come here for dinner, and before and after dinner, they can also talk, sing, or dance a fast-paced folk dance in the entertainment room.

    In the evening, after visiting the "Nine-Arch Bridge", the hosts also warmly invited us to have dinner at the small restaurant. What caught our attention first after entering was: a folk band was playing, and many people were singing and dancing to it, as if the fatigue of the day had been swept away.

    The first violinist of the band was a sixty-three-year-old man with gray hair. His sparkling eyes, rich expressions, and melodious琴声 gave people infinite vitality. No one in the entire Hortobágy doesn't know the old artist Plai Zsigmond, and everyone calls him "Happy Uncle."

    This old artist came to Hortobágy from Budapest in 1935 with his beloved violin. Soon he became a loyal friend of the poor herders in this wilderness, living and singing with them day and night. Colorful folk songs, like spring water, continuously enriched the performance of this versatile violinist. At that time, some landlords and nobles wanted Plai to play for them, and some theater or restaurant owners wanted to buy this violinist to be a cash cow. But Plai's answer to them was: "I would rather smash my beloved violin than play for you."

    Liberation gave Hortobágy a new life, the wilderness became a treasure land, and a power station and railway were built in this isolated place, with electricity, telephones, schools, cultural palaces, cinemas, stadiums and swimming pools. The new life also rejuvenated the old artist Plai. He has written countless songs praising Hortobágy. From the construction site of the canal to the boundless pasture, from the newly planted jungle to the beautiful artificial lake, from the magnificent cultural palace to the old restaurant... He keeps playing for the people who are building the new Hortobágy everywhere.

    "I left Hortobágy for two or three years, performing in the capital, and I was also invited to perform abroad. But whether it is day or in my dreams, my heart always flies to Hortobágy. Hortobágy has the best galloping horses, but none of them can carry my heart out of Hortobágy…" — Before he finished speaking, the old man then played a popular folk tune on the prairie.

    不毛荒野变宝地
    本报记者　王崇杰
    我们赶到匈牙利最东部的哈伊杜—比哈尔州之后，首先访问了古今著名的霍尔多巴吉。过去这儿是中欧最大的荒野，面积达二十多万霍尔特，以荒凉和离奇的故事闻名国内外。解放后匈牙利人民战胜了自然的灾害，彻底改变了霍尔多巴吉的命运，使它从不毛之地变成了丰富的农产区。
      无际的荒原
    荒野啊，荒野，
    霍尔多巴吉的荒野，
    你无边又无际，
    像天空一样的辽阔。
    霍尔多巴吉的很多民歌都是这样开头的。但根据历史学家的考查，霍尔多巴吉原来并不是荒凉的原野。十三世纪中叶以前，这一带曾分布着许多村庄，土地很肥沃。后来由于鞑靼人和土耳其人的侵入，乡村被摧毁，森林被砍伐或焚烧。风和干旱在几百年的时间里把大片良田变成了碱性土质的荒原。后来蒂萨河又经常泛滥，使人无法居住。好几个世纪中，只有贫穷的牧民被地主们强迫在这荒地上为他们牧放着牲畜。牧民们赶着牛羊，一年四季在霍尔多巴吉到处流浪，夜晚就睡在露天地上和牛羊身旁。
    1840年蒂萨河被修治后，霍尔多巴吉就变得更加干燥。雨量很少，土质日益碱化，草原更加荒凉。据1924年的统计，霍尔多巴吉50％的面积是不毛之地，16％的面积可以长草，30％的面积天旱时连草也长不起来。夏天，绿草在烈日的照晒下很快枯萎。所以只有在炙热的夏日到来之前，这里才能放牧。因而畜牧业也日益衰退。
    只有霍尔多巴吉奇特的风光还吸引着远近的旅客。这里昼夜气候变化多端。深夜，牧人们取暖的篝火在万籁俱寂的荒原上时隐时现。中午这里有海市蜃楼——荒野上的几所小茅屋、几棵树和散乱的牛羊倒映在空中。它好像在告诉人们：“看看霍尔多巴吉的可怜相吧，在二十多万霍尔特的土地上就只有这样一点财产……。”
    解放前，地主们勾心斗角，谁都想在这荒野多捞一点油水，可是谁也不想去投资改造它。当时国家的统治者订了很多开发霍尔多巴吉的计划，开了很多空头支票，但霍尔多巴吉却一天比一天更加荒芜。
      荒野变成万宝地
    今天的霍尔多巴吉以人战胜自然的奇迹而名传四方。看，往年饥饿的荒野上出现了崭新的村庄，稻田连着麦田，绿原上到处是一群群肥硕的牲畜，鱼儿在养鱼池里游来游去，一片片新种的树林在成长。农、林、牧、副、渔都在蓬勃发展。
    征服霍尔多巴吉的斗争是从1948年开始的。国家在这里建立了五个国营农场，很多农业专家、工人和农民都响应党的号召，纷纷赶到这里，展开了大规模开荒和改良土壤的工作。
    要彻底改变霍尔多巴吉的面貌首先必须解决缺水的问题。为此，在哈伊杜—比哈尔州开始修建了长达一百公里的东运河，并修整了西运河，把蒂萨河水引向霍尔多巴吉。接着在这里建立了灌溉网，使奔流的河水开始滋润着枯竭荒芜的土地。随着水利建设的进行，霍尔多巴吉的农业生产得到了飞速的发展。
    政府去年决定把原来建立的五个国营农场合并为一个，以便更好地利用大规模经营的优越性来有计划地发展霍尔多巴吉。这个大型国营企业的总农艺师萨波·亚诺什同志热情地向我们详细介绍了农场的生产情况。
    农场有两万霍尔特的耕地，其中一半已建立了完整的灌溉网。去年提供国家的小麦达三万六千公担、大米二万四千五百公担、糖萝卜六万二千公担。由于改良了土壤，这里可以种麦子、稻子、玉米、烟草等各种农作物。国家在机器方面也给霍尔多巴吉很多支持，现在这里仅拖拉机就有二百五十多台（以十五马力计算），并有十一辆载重汽车。
    畜牧业近年来得到了空前的发展。现在国营农场有六万多头羊、三千多头牛、近五千头猪、七百匹马和四万多只家禽，每年都向国家提供大批的畜产品。国营农场并负责向全国其他地区提供各种良种牲畜，支援全国畜牧业的发展。为保证牲畜有足够的饲料，已整理了近三万霍尔特的牧场。在一定时期并向草地灌溉。原来要四个霍尔特的草地才能喂养一头牛，经过灌溉的草地每一霍尔特就可喂养两头牛，在这种草地上吃草的牛每天可增加一公斤肉，奶牛的产奶量也很高。
    国营农场还有近八千霍尔特的人工养鱼池。今年计划提供市场二百万公斤鱼。人工养鱼池大都建在不适于耕种的地带。在这些地方建鱼池可以一举两得：一方面可生产大量的鱼；另方面可帮助改良土壤。经验证明，经过几年养鱼后，碱性的土质会发生很大变化。现在国营农场一般都是采用三年养鱼，一年种谷物的方法。国营农场的总农艺师说，今后几年内养鱼池要扩大到两万五千多霍尔特。
    为了改变霍尔多巴吉的气候和防风沙，国营农场十几年来一直十分重视植树造林。过去这片光秃秃的荒野上，现在已有二千五百霍尔特树林。今后十年内树林的面积将继续增加两倍多。
    农产品加工业也很受重视。这里已建立了现代化的畜产品加工工厂。
    在第二个五年计划期间霍尔多巴吉在生产和建设方面都将得到更大的发展。
      养马人的话
    我们去参观养马场时，正好是放马的时间。一大群肥壮的马接连冲出宽大整齐的马房，向空地跑去。一位中年人熟练地骑在马上，扬鞭赶着马群来往奔驰。农场的负责人告诉我们说，这位放马的同志是农场著名的养马能手，萨波·加波尔。
    我们找到了萨波·加波尔同志，请他谈谈养马的经验。这位养马能手沉思了一会，慢慢地讲道：“要把马养好，必需像母亲爱护自己的孩子一样去关心马，熟悉每一匹马的特点，关心他们的饮食，严格地管理和训练。养马也同其他工作一样，如果不热爱这种工作，不专心去钻研和改进，是很难做好的……”
    萨波的话还没讲完，一些牧人便围上了我们。大家索兴坐在草地上畅谈起来。这些牧人中有养马的，也有放羊或放牛的。他们每个人都为自己所担负的工作而感到骄傲。谈着谈着放牛的朋友就唱起了他们的歌：
    我不后悔生来就是一个牧童，
    更不后悔成了一个放牛的人，
    美丽的宫殿换不走我的小狗，
    我用整个心灵爱着牧场和牛群……
    这是他们对自己的劳动的赞歌。牧民们在穿戴上也喜欢标志出自己的职业，用的鞭子也都是自己精心编制的，木柄上还有美丽的雕刻。
      老艺人和小提琴
    来到霍尔多巴吉的旅客总要去参观一下著名的“九孔桥”，顺便到桥边的小饭馆去尝一尝在当地有悠久传统的美味饭菜。
    “九孔桥”建于1827年，长达一百六十七米，是匈牙利最长的石桥。桥旁的小饭馆是在1781年建成的。现在这个饭馆除饭厅外，还设有娱乐室。牧人们在一天劳动之后，常喜欢到这里来吃晚饭，饭前饭后也可以在娱乐室内谈谈心，唱唱歌，或者跳一番节奏急迫的民族舞蹈。
    傍晚在参观了“九孔桥”之后，主人们也热情地邀我们到小饭馆去用晚餐。进门后首先引起我们注意的是：一个民间乐队正在演奏，不少人伴着它且歌且舞，好像一天的疲劳都一扫而光了。
    乐队的第一小提琴手是一位须发斑白的六十三岁的老人。他那闪闪发光的眼睛、丰富的表情和幽扬的琴声，给人们以无限的活力。整个霍尔多巴吉的居民没有一个人不认识普拉伊·日格蒙德老艺人的，大家称他为“快乐的叔叔”。
    这位老艺人是1935年带着自己心爱的小提琴从布达佩斯来到霍尔多巴吉的。很快地他就成为这个荒野上贫苦牧民们忠实的朋友，日夜同他们一起生活和歌唱。多彩的民歌像泉水一样源源不绝地丰富着这位多才多艺的小提琴手的演奏。当时有的地主贵族曾想让普拉伊为他们演奏，也有一些戏院或饭店的老板想收买这位提琴手去当摇钱树。但普拉伊给他们的回答是：“我宁肯摔碎心爱的小提琴也不去为你们演奏。”
    解放使霍尔多巴吉获得了新生，荒野变成了宝地，过去这与世隔绝的地方也建起了发电站和铁路，有了电灯、电话、学校、文化宫、电影院、体育场和游泳池等。新生活也使普拉伊老艺人恢复了青春。他编写了不知多少赞美霍尔多巴吉的歌曲。他从修运河的工地到无边的牧场，从新植的丛林到美丽的人造湖畔，从华丽的文化宫到古老的小饭馆……到处不停地为建设新霍尔多巴吉的人们演奏。
    “我曾离开霍尔多巴吉两三年，在首都演出，也应邀到国外演奏过。但不论是白天，还是在梦中，我的心总是飞向霍尔多巴吉。霍尔多巴吉有最好的善于奔驰的骏马，但没有哪一匹能把我的心载出霍尔多巴吉……”——话还没讲完，老人接着又拉起了草原上流行的民间小曲。
