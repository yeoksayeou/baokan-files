    Xinhua News Agency, 1st April News: TASS reported that after a five-day visit to various French provinces, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage returned to Paris yesterday afternoon. Khrushchev's motorcade was warmly welcomed by thousands of Parisians as it entered Paris.
    Yesterday afternoon, Khrushchev received French trade union movement leaders, including the General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Frachon, at his residence. They had a sincere conversation. Khrushchev also received a group of women activists from the French capital, including journalists, writers, and lawyers. In the evening, Soviet Ambassador to France, Vinogradov, held a grand banquet for Khrushchev. Khrushchev and French Prime Minister Debré delivered speeches at the banquet.
    Khrushchev said that our visit to France is coming to an end. We hope to come to Paris again this May when the leaders of France, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States hold a meeting here. The convening of this meeting has become possible due to the improvement in international relations. Moreover, as we hope, this meeting itself will be an important step on the road to further easing international tensions. Obviously, it is impossible to solve all urgent problems in one meeting. Therefore, we should start by solving the most important and pressing issues, such as complete and thorough disarmament, the conclusion of a German peace treaty, and the cessation of nuclear weapons tests—if the necessary agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests cannot be reached by then. At the same time, we must gradually seek ways to solve other problems.
    He continued, there is a saying in our country: Moscow was not built in a day. This means that it takes time to accomplish any major task. However, we have revised this saying: in the past eight years, we have actually built a "second Moscow." During this period, the new houses and public buildings built in Moscow are equal in area to all the buildings built in the eight hundred years since the establishment of Moscow. Of course, building a house of peace is much more difficult than building a city. However, just as the fruits of human thought can enable people to build huge and beautiful cities in a short period of time, the victory of reason should help mankind stop the forces of war. Khrushchev said that friendship between the Soviet Union and France is one of the important factors in ensuring peace and security in Europe and the world. We hope that our meeting and talks with President de Gaulle will help further strengthen this friendship.
    After the reception, Khrushchev went to Rambouillet, the suburban residence of the President of the French Republic, where Khrushchev began talks with de Gaulle.

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联驻法大使招待会上说
    高级会议应着手解决重要问题
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员在法国各省访问五天以后，在昨天下午回到巴黎。赫鲁晓夫的汽车队在驶入巴黎时受到成千上万巴黎人的热烈欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫昨天下午在寓所接见了法国总工会总书记弗拉商等法国工会运动领导人。彼此进行了诚恳的谈话。赫鲁晓夫还接见了法国首都的一批妇女活动家，其中有记者、作家和律师。晚上，苏联驻法国大使维诺格拉多夫为赫鲁晓夫举行盛大的宴会。赫鲁晓夫与法国总理德勃雷在宴会上先后致词。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们在法国的访问即将结束。我们希望今年5月在法国、苏联、英国和美国领导人在这里举行会议时再次来巴黎。由于国际关系出现了好转，召开这次会议有了可能。而且，正如我们所希望的，这次会议本身将是进一步缓和国际紧张局势道路上的重要步骤。显然，在一次会晤里是不能一下子解决所有迫切问题的。因此，应当从解决最重要的刻不容缓的问题开始，譬如，全面彻底裁军，缔结对德和约，停止核武器试验——如果到那时还不能就停止核武器试验问题达成必要的协议的话。同时要逐步寻求解决其他问题的方法。
    他接着说，我国民间有句谚语：莫斯科不是一下子建起来的。这就是说，办任何一件大事都需要一定的时间。不过，我们对这个谚语作了修正：最近八年来实际上我们建成了“第二个莫斯科”。在这期间在莫斯科建设的新住宅、公共建筑物，就面积来说等于莫斯科建立以来八百年中建造的所有建筑物的面积。当然，建筑和平大厦要比建筑一座城市困难得多。但是，正如人类思维的成果能够使人们在短期内建起庞大美丽的城市一样，理智的胜利应当帮助人类制止战争的势力。赫鲁晓夫说，苏法之间的友谊是保障欧洲以及全世界和平和安全的重要因素之一。我们希望，我们和戴高乐总统的会晤和会谈将有助于进一步加强这种友谊。
    招待会结束后赫鲁晓夫前往法兰西共和国总统郊外官邸郎布依埃，在那里赫鲁晓夫同戴高乐开始会谈。
