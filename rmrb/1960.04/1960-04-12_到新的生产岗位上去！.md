In the mass movement of vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution, a large amount of manual labor in many regions and enterprises has been replaced by mechanized, semi-mechanized, automated, and semi-automated operations, thus saving a large amount of labor. This is a very gratifying thing.

How to rationally arrange these saved labor forces to further develop production is a very meticulous task. In this regard, the factories in Chongqing and Changsha provide us with very good experiences.

The approach of Chongqing and Changsha is to first quickly transfer the saved manpower, some to support key projects and weak links in their own industries, some to support urban and rural commune industries with production technology, and those with higher technical levels to form technical innovation shock brigades to support other units in carrying out innovation. This approach is very good. It rapidly expands the achievements of enterprise technical innovation and technical revolution, and at the same time, quickly transferring surplus manpower is also a promotion for the enterprise itself. Because after the surplus people are transferred, labor productivity will increase accordingly, forcing people to adhere to the use of new creations and new technologies, and the results of technical innovation will naturally be consolidated. Therefore, this approach is of great benefit to both the supported units and the enterprises that transfer manpower. It is a very important experience that Chongqing and Changsha have used a large number of saved manpower to develop the production of fuels and raw materials such as iron and steel, coal, and chemicals, and to develop the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and the processing industry of waste materials. Now, the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has brought about new contradictions between the supply and demand of fuels and raw materials. Guaranteeing the supply of fuels and raw materials is an important key to ensuring the sustained development of production and technical revolution. Timely transfer of surplus manpower to vigorously run "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" for iron and steel, coal, and other raw material production can not only quickly arrange surplus manpower and rapidly expand production, but also rapidly improve the material resources for the new productive forces generated by the technical revolution.

Chongqing also transferred people with lower technical levels to learn technology, and Changsha used surplus manpower to set up some factories that are developing in the direction of "high-precision and cutting-edge," increasing new products. These are all methods full of revolutionary and enterprising spirit. Doing so will play a significant role in accelerating the improvement of our production technology level.

The manpower saved in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a powerful force for further developing production and promoting the high-speed development of social productive forces. Since the beginning of this year, Chongqing has transferred more than 80,000 laborers; Changsha City has set up more than 1,000 satellite factories using only a portion of the saved manpower and equipment. Quickly transferring this powerful force to new production battlefields will be an important way to ensure the continued leap forward in production this year.

### 到新的生产岗位上去！

    到新的生产岗位上去！
    在大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，许多地区和企业的大量手工劳动为机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化的操作所代替，从而节省出大量的劳动力来。这是一件十分可喜的事。
    怎样合理地安排这些节省出的大量劳动力来进一步发展生产，是一项十分细致的工作。在这方面，重庆和长沙各厂给我们提供了很好的经验。
    重庆和长沙的作法是，首先把节省出的人力迅速抽调出来，有的支援本行业的重点工程和薄弱环节，有的从生产技术上支援城市和农村的公社工业，技术水平较高的则组成技术革新突击队支援别的单位搞革新。这种作法很好，它迅速地扩大了企业技术革新和技术革命的成果，同时迅速把节余人力抽调出来，对于本企业也是一种促进。因为节余的人抽走以后，劳动生产率才会随着提高，会逼着人们非坚持使用新创造、新技术不可，技术革新成果自然就得到了巩固。因此，这个作法不论对被支援的单位或是对抽调人力的企业，都有很大的好处。重庆和长沙都把节省下的很大一批人力用来发展钢铁、煤炭、化工等燃料和原材料的生产，发展原材料的综合利用和废旧材料加工工业，是一条很重要的经验，现在，技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，带来了燃料和原材料供应与需要不相适应的新矛盾。保证燃料和原材料的供应，是保证生产和技术革命持续发展的重要关键。及时地把节余的人力抽出来大办铁钢、煤炭和其他生产原材料的“小洋群”和“小土群”，既能迅速地安排节余的人力，迅速扩大生产，又能给技术革命产生的新生产力迅速提高物质资源。
  重庆还抽调技术水平较低的人去学习技术，长沙用节余人力办了一些向“高精尖”方向发展的工厂，增加新产品。这都是富于革命进取精神的办法。这样做，对加速提高我们的生产技术水平将会发生很大的作用。
    技术革新和技术革命运动中节省出的人力，是进一步发展生产，推动社会生产力高速度发展的一支强大力量。今年以来，重庆抽调出的劳动力有八万多人；长沙市仅用节省出的一部分人力和设备就办起了一千多个卫星工厂。迅速地把这支强大的队伍调到新的生产战场上去，这将是保证今年生产继续跃进的一个重要的办法。
