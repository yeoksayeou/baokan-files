Comrades and Delegates:

I fully agree with and support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. Now, please allow me to report to the conference on the general situation of the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry in Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province.

Hard Work, Practical Work, Plus Skillful Work: Production and Construction Leap Forward Together

1958 was a year of rapid development for the iron and steel industry in Ma'anshan. Like the people of the whole country, the people of our city, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, were full of spirit and high morale, and threw themselves into the production and construction of the iron and steel industry with selfless labor enthusiasm. At that time, the people of our city achieved: "One investment becomes two, work efficiency doubles, hard work, practical work, plus skillful work, high-speed construction of Ma'anshan." As a result, we achieved a major leap forward in iron and steel production and construction. In 1958, the investment in capital construction was more than four times that of 1957, exceeding the total investment completed during the First Five-Year Plan by 60%; the annual output of pig iron (excluding native iron) increased sharply by 76% compared with 1957; the annual output of iron ore increased by 2.2 times compared with 1957; at the same time, we also started steel production, ending the history of Ma'anshan having iron but no steel.

On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, 1959 was an even greater leap forward year. In 1959, the level of iron and steel production and construction in our city continued to rise steadily. Especially after the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, it was an even greater leap forward. Compared with the third quarter, steel increased by 135% and iron increased by 50.5% in the fourth quarter. In 1959, the annual output of pig iron increased by 1.5 times compared with 1958, and the annual output of iron ore increased by 1.1 times compared with 1958. The annual output of steel increased by 28 times compared with 1958, and the production of rolled steel began.

With the rapid development of iron and steel production and construction, various technical and economic indicators in our city have also made great progress, and the technical level has also been significantly improved. In 1959, the utilization coefficient of medium-sized blast furnaces and small blast furnaces reached the national advanced level. The No. 2 Red Flag small blast furnace with a volume of eight cubic meters in the First Iron Smelting Plant achieved an average utilization coefficient of over four in December last year, and has been maintaining excellent results of high yield, high quality, and low cost. In terms of capital construction, we have also strived for the upper reaches. The newly built 250-cubic-meter blast furnace in the Second Iron Smelting Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel only took more than two months to build and put into production, shortening the construction period by more than three months compared with the past; the construction project of a 90-meter-high reinforced concrete chimney in the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Coking Plant took only six days, twenty hours, and fifteen minutes to build; the No. 1 Engineering Office of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel completed a 45-meter-high brick chimney in just eight and a half hours. The workers composed a poem to describe the speed of infrastructure construction and the enthusiasm of the infrastructure workers:

　　Early in the morning, a pile of bricks on the ground,
　　At dusk, a red tower seen among the white clouds,
　　It is not that pedestrians are playing tricks with their eyes,
　　The heroic enthusiasm breaks through the sky.

The iron and steel facts of the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 have irrefutably proved the unparalleled greatness and correctness of the Party's General Line for building socialism, which concentratedly reflects the strong desire of the Chinese people to build socialism at a high speed. The victory of the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward is a great victory of the General Line, a great victory of a set of "walking on two legs" policies centered on the General Line, and a great victory of the mass movement. This victory has not only thoroughly shattered all the attacks and slanders of enemies at home and abroad and thoroughly shattered those various kinds of right-leaning arguments, but also is the most realistic and powerful education for those with conservative ideas.

We Have Nothing, Only a Pair of Hands; As Long As We Rely on the Party, We Will Have Everything

In the Great Leap Forward, in the vigorous mass movement, the people of our city, like the people of the whole country, have always been full of energy and forging ahead in order to get rid of our country's "poor and blank" face. They said: "We have nothing, only a pair of hands; we rely on the Party for everything, and we will have everything." "Not for fame, not for profit, everything is for socialism." It is precisely because they have such a red heart for building socialism that they never pick and choose jobs in their work. The workers of the No. 2 Red Flag small blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel have always insisted on putting ore into the furnace without screening or washing since the small blast furnace was put into production for more than sixteen months. Even in the cold winter with heavy snow, the workers still insisted on washing ore in the water despite the dissuasion of the leading cadres. The workers who participated in the construction of blast furnaces, converters, and coke ovens in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel could not be dissuaded before the furnaces were built. They worked hard day and night, regardless of sunny or rainy days, greatly accelerating the speed of furnace construction. Many cadres also "took the factory as their home" like all the workers and lived, ate, and worked with the workers all year round. Many workers also consciously used their holidays to recycle materials. According to statistics in 1959 alone, the city's workers picked up more than 30,000 tons of scrap iron. The vast number of workers combined hard work and practical work with skillful work in the socialist labor competition of last year's Great Leap Forward, with the vigorous development of technological innovation and technological revolution as the content. They showed the noble style of "taking on difficulties, giving up honors, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward" in the technological innovation movement. Shi Keqi, a winding worker in the First Iron Smelting Plant, in order to change the manual operation of the winding machine of the charging system of the small blast furnace to mechanized operation, after many painstaking studies, worked hard for several days and nights in a row, and finally successfully created the full automation of the winding machine and the hopper gate. The Qiu Chenglang Youth Bricklayer Assault Team of the First Engineering Office, in order to improve the speed and quality of bricklaying, all 21 members of the team held "Zhuge Liang meetings" when walking, "Zhuge Liang meetings" before and after meals, and even a "Zhuge Liang meeting" before going to bed. After collective research and mutual cooperation, except for the automatic bricklaying machine which is still in trial production, all processes have been fully mechanized and semi-mechanized, and the bricklaying trowel and bamboo basket have been discarded. There are many, many advanced people like those mentioned above who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to charge towards all outdated rules and regulations and all difficulties.

In the past two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, our city has always conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" and has been self-reliant and armed ourselves. For example, if there is no foreign coke for iron smelting, we insist on smelting native coke ourselves; if there is a lack of refractory bricks and cement, we manufacture them ourselves. In 1959 alone, we smelted 1 million tons of native coke, burned 38,700 tons of various refractory materials, and ground more than 11,000 tons of slag cement, basically meeting the needs of production and construction. In order to produce more pig iron, our city seized the construction and production of small blast furnaces as early as the year before last. Thirty-four small blast furnaces with a volume of 8 to 28 cubic meters were built. After consolidation and improvement in 1959, not only did the No. 2 Red Flag small blast furnace with an average utilization coefficient of 2.921 tons per year appear, but also the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the city reached 1.831 in the fourth quarter of last year, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest. The pig iron produced by small blast furnaces throughout the year accounted for 14.2% of the city's total output, and because small pieces of coke and small pieces of ore left over from large blast furnaces were used, the cost was lower than that of large blast furnaces, and the quality was completely qualified.

Three Months of Vigorous Technological Innovation Saved 19,000 Workers

Encouraged by the victory of the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of the people in the city has become even higher. They have thrown themselves into the high tide of production and construction in 1960 with greater revolutionary enthusiasm and into the increasingly extensive and in-depth technological innovation and technological revolution movement. They have vigorously promoted the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, which has powerfully promoted production, and have achieved "increased production, increased personnel, and reduced personnel." As a result, a large number of people can be drawn from old enterprises to support newly built enterprises. According to statistics, from December last year to the first half of March this year, 19,000 people have been saved. More than 25,000 technological innovation projects proposed by the city's workers from mid-February to early March this year, of which more than 3,100 relatively major ones have been realized, greatly increasing the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in production. The average labor productivity has increased by 48.4% compared with the end of last year, and various productions have overfulfilled the state plan for steel and steel materials in the first quarter of this year by 17 days and 31 days respectively ahead of schedule.

In short, Ma'anshan, like all parts of our great motherland, presents a prosperous scene and a newest and most beautiful picture, and our future is bright. Although there will still be difficulties of varying degrees on the road ahead, we have the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are full of energy, and no difficulties can stop our lofty aspirations to build socialism. We must continue to hold high the great banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and strive to win a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year!

    大搞群众运动，实现高产再高产
    张德宝代表谈马鞍山钢铁工业大跃进各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。现在，请让我就安徽省马鞍山市钢铁工业高速度发展的概况，向大会作如下汇报。
    苦干实干加巧干，生产基建齐跃进
    1958年是马鞍山钢铁工业飞跃发展的一年，我市人民同全国人民一样，在总路线的光辉照耀下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，以忘我的劳动热情投入了钢铁工业的生产和建设。当时，我市人民做到了：“投资一顶二，工效成倍翻，苦干实干加巧干，高速建设马鞍山。”从而取得了钢铁生产、建设的特大跃进。1958年基本建设投资额为1957年的四倍以上，比第一个五年计划期间完成的投资总额还多60％；生铁年产量（不包括土铁）比1957年猛增76％；铁矿石的年产量比1957年陡增二点二倍；同时，我们还开始了炼钢生产，结束了马鞍山有铁无钢的历史。
    在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年更是特大跃进的一年。1959年我市钢铁生产建设水平一直蒸蒸日上，特别是贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会决议精神后，更是大幅度的跃进，以第四季度和第三季度相比，钢增长135％，铁增长50.5％。1959年生铁年产量比1958年增长了一点五倍，铁矿石年产量比1958年增长了一点一倍。钢的年产量比1958年增长二十八倍，并开始了轧钢生产。
    随着钢铁生产建设的飞速发展，我市各项技术经济指标也有很大进步，技术水平也有显著的提高。1959年，中型高炉和小高炉的利用系数均达到了全国的先进水平，第一炼铁厂的八立方米红旗二号小高炉，去年12月份平均利用系数达到四以上，并一直保持着高产、优质、低成本的优异成绩。在基本建设方面也同样争得了上游，马钢第二炼铁厂新建的二百五十立方米高炉，只用了两个多月的建设时间便投入了生产，比过去缩短三个多月的工期；马钢焦化厂的一个九十米高的钢筋混凝土烟囱的建设工程，只用了六天零二十小时十五分钟就浇筑起来了；马钢第一工程处一个四十五米高的砖烟囱，只用八小时半的时间就完成了。职工们编了这样一首诗来形容基建施工速度和基建工人的干劲：
    早看平地一堆砖，
    暮见红塔白云间，
    非是行人弄花眼，
    英雄干劲冲破天。
    1958年和1959年连续两年大跃进的钢铁般的事实，无可辩驳地证明了党的建设社会主义总路线的无比伟大和正确，它集中的体现了我国人民要求高速度建设社会主义的强烈愿望。连续两年大跃进的胜利，是总路线的伟大胜利，是围绕着总路线的一套两条腿走路的方针的伟大胜利，是群众运动的伟大胜利。这个胜利，不仅彻底地粉碎了国内外一切敌人对我们的攻击和污蔑，彻底粉碎了那些形形色色的右倾论调；对那些有保守思想的人，也是一个最现实最有力的教育。
    什么都没有，只有一双手；只要依靠党，什么都会有
    在大跃进中，在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，我市人民同全国人民一样，为了摆脱我国“一穷二白”的面貌，始终是干劲冲天，勇往直前。他们说：“什么都没有，只有一双手；事事依靠党，什么都会有。”“一不为名，二不为利，一切为了社会主义。”正是因为他们有了这样一颗建设社会主义的红心，他们在工作中从不挑肥拣瘦。马钢红旗二号小高炉职工，从这座小高炉开始投入生产的十六个多月来，始终坚持矿石不筛不洗不入炉，甚至在大雪纷纷的寒冬，工人们还不顾领导干部的劝阻，坚持下水洗矿石。参加马鞍山的高炉、转炉、焦炉建设的职工们，在炉子未建成之前，同样都是劝阻不住，不分白天黑夜，不分晴天雨天，苦干巧干，大大加快了建炉的速度，许多干部也同全体职工一样，“以厂为家”，长年累月和工人同吃同住同劳动。很多职工还自觉的利用假日去回收物资。仅据1959年的统计，全市职工就拣了三万多吨碎铁。广大职工在去年大跃进的社会主义劳动竞赛中，是以大搞技术革新和技术革命为内容，把苦干实干与巧干密切结合起来的，他们在技术革新运动中，表现了“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”的高尚风格。第一炼铁厂卷扬工时克启，为了把小高炉上料系统的卷扬机由手工操作改为机械化操作，经过多次苦心钻研，一连苦战几个昼夜，终于创造成功卷扬机和料坑闸门全盘自动化。第一工程处丘成亮青年瓦工突击队，为了提高砌砖速度和质量，全队二十一名队员，走路时开“诸葛亮会”，吃饭前后开“诸葛亮会”，睡觉前也要开个“诸葛亮会”，经过集体研究和相互协作，现除自动砌砖机还在试制外，各道工序都全部实现了机械化和半机械化，扔掉了瓦刀和箩筐扁担。像上述这些敢想、敢说、敢干，敢于向一切陈规戒律和一切困难冲锋陷阵的先进人物，是很多很多的。
  在过去连续两年的大跃进中，我市始终认真贯彻了党的“两条腿走路”的方针，并且自力更生，自己武装自己。如炼铁没有洋焦，我们就坚持自炼土焦，缺乏耐火砖、水泥，我们就自己制造。仅在1959年，我们就炼了一百万吨土焦，烧制了三万八千七百吨各种耐火材料，磨制矿渣水泥一万一千多吨，基本上满足了生产建设的需要。为了多产生铁，我市早在前年就抓紧了小高炉的建设和生产。建成八至二十八立方米小高炉三十四座，经过1959年的巩固和提高，不仅出现了全年平均利用系数二点九二一吨的红旗二号小高炉，去年第四季度全市小高炉的平均利用系数达到一点八三一，获得了大面积丰收，全年小高炉生产的生铁占全市生产总产量的14.2％，而且由于利用了大高炉剩下的小块焦和小块矿，成本比大高炉还低，质量也完全合格。
    大闹技术革新三个月节省劳力一万九千人
    经过连续两年大跃进的胜利鼓舞，全市人民的热情更加高涨，他们以更大革命干劲投入了1960年的生产建设高潮，投入了日益广泛、深入的技术革新和技术革命运动，大搞手工操作机械化和半机械化，有力推动了生产，做到了“增产增人又减人”，从而能够在老企业中抽出大批人力支援新建企业。据统计，从去年12月到今年3月上半月，已节约了一万九千人，今年2月中旬到3月上旬全市职工所提出的二万五千多个技术革新项目，其中比较重大的已经实现了三千一百多个，使生产中的机械化和半机械化的程度大大提高，劳动生产率平均比去年年底提高48.4％，各项生产分别提前十七天和三十一天超额完成了今年第一季度的钢和钢材的国家计划。
  总之，马鞍山展示在我们面前的，同我们伟大祖国的各个地方一样，是一片繁荣的景象，是一幅最新最美的画图，我们的前景一片光明。在前进的道路上尽管还会有或大或小的困难，但我们有党中央和毛主席的领导，我们浑身都是劲，什么困难也挡不住我们建设社会主义的壮志雄心。我们要继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大旗帜，为夺取今年更大更好更全面的跃进而努力奋斗！
