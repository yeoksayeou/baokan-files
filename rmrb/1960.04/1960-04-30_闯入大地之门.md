    Bursting into the Gate of the Earth
    Member of the 203 Geological Team of the Geological Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Xu Fude
    Our work is mainly in the field, mostly in sparsely populated areas, where animals and birds abound, in deep mountains and valleys, and on deserts and grasslands. But we love our work! We are the vanguards of the vanguard of the socialist construction of the motherland, the detectives who seek industrial raw materials. In the vast land of the motherland—high mountains, deep valleys, grasslands, deserts—everywhere are our footprints, everywhere is our sweat! "Make nature offer its treasures!" This is our heroic slogan. We knock on the gates of the earth everywhere, calling on the treasures that have been sleeping for thousands of years to come out and serve the people, to create material wealth for the people.
    We are geological workers, but also travelers and appreciators... We enjoy endless rare flowers and herbs in all seasons, and taste endless mountain delicacies and fruits in all seasons. The landscape of the motherland is so beautiful! Climbing to the top of the mountain and looking down, the scenery of the city and countryside is magnificent. Urban houses are densely packed, chimneys stand in rows, and only green smoke rises straight up. The rural fertile fields are green, stretching as far as the eye can see. Star-studded reservoirs are like mirrors in the sunlight, shining brightly. Silver ribbon-like rivers, canals, highways, and railways are interwoven into a network...
    Throughout the year, we also endure wind, rain, frost, and snow, hunger, thirst, cold, and heat, but these are nothing to us. Work has tempered our strong will and healthy physique.
    Last year, we worked in the vast semi-grassland and semi-desert area on the Sino-Mongolian border. We drove a small jeep for a day without seeing a single household or a single person. Only herds of gazelles appeared intermittently. At night, we found an old, deserted lama temple, and when we walked in, it felt eerie, but we settled down there. Later, the biggest threat was water. There was a well more than two miles away from the temple, but the water volume was extremely small, and the water tasted bitter. We saved water, brushed our teeth every few days, and simply didn't wash our faces.
    The desert climate changes drastically: "In the morning, wear a leather coat, at noon, wear gauze, and eat watermelon around the stove." It was clearly a clear blue sky, but in an instant, dark clouds covered the sky, wind and sand rose, and it was chaotic, like a thick fog rising at sea, making it impossible to see more than three or five meters away. Flying sand hit our faces, we couldn't open our eyes, and we couldn't distinguish the direction. I remember very clearly that on the afternoon of May 15th last year, the weather was originally clear, and I was working hard in the field, when suddenly a strong wind blew, and in an instant, black clouds surged, and large drops of rain fell in the air, and then turned into goose feather snow, flying one after another, freezing me so much that I shivered, but I did not retreat!
    Our work is very mobile, and everywhere is "home." Every time we arrive in a rural village, whether it is an old man, an elder sister-in-law, a young person, or a child, as long as they see a surveying rod, they will gather around: "Oh, the surveying team is here!" "The people who are looking for treasures are here!" Some old men stroked their gray beards and said to us excitedly: "The people who are looking for treasures have come to our place, this has never happened before! Comrades, do we have any treasures here?" The village cadres were busy finding houses and cooking for us... Everywhere we received the trust and comfort of relatives!
    Sometimes "home" is in the city, and on Sundays we can watch movies and stroll down the road. But we have our own set of entertainment: some are getting haircuts, some are making dumplings, some are going out to hunt gazelles, some are listening to the radio, playing poker, playing chess, and so on. When the radio broadcasts that a certain factory or mine has overfulfilled its monthly production plan, we congratulate each other and proudly say: "There is also a little bit of our blood and sweat in it!"
    Indeed, seeing that roads and railways have been built in the places where we have worked, concentrators and mines have been built, and sparsely populated wildernesses have become bustling towns, how excited, moved, and nostalgic our hearts are! However, for the future, in order to find more wealth for the motherland, we do not hesitate to pack our bags and rush to new, unfamiliar, desolate lands with endless treasures...

    闯入大地之门
    内蒙古自治区地质局203地质队队员　徐夫得
    我们的工作主要是在野外，多半是在人烟稀少，兽禽成群，深山幽谷，沙漠草原上。但我们热爱自己的工作！我们是祖国社会主义建设尖兵的尖兵，是寻找工业原料的侦探者。在祖国辽阔的土地上——高山、深谷、草原、沙漠，处处有我们的足迹，处处有我们的汗流！“要大自然献宝！”这是我们豪迈的口号。我们到处叩开大地门户，叫那千年沉睡的宝藏出来为人民服务，为人民创造物质财富。
    我们是地质工作者，也是游览家、欣赏家……赏不尽四时奇花异草，尝不完四季山珍美果。祖国江山如此多娇！登上山峰俯望，城乡一片好风光。城市房屋鳞次栉比，烟囱林立，只见青烟直上。农村良田绿油油，一望无垠。星罗棋布的水库，活像阳光下的镜子，闪闪发光。银带般的河道水渠、公路、铁路交织成网。……
    一年四季我们也饱经风雨霜雪，饥渴寒暑，但，这些对我们来说，根本不算一回事，工作锻炼了我们坚强的意志和健壮的体格。
    去年我们在中蒙边境茫茫的半草原半沙漠上工作。小吉普卡行驶一天，也没见到一户人家、半个人影。只有成群黄羊，时现时隐。入夜，我们找到一座破旧无人的喇嘛庙，走进去阴森森地，但我们就在里面安下了家。以后最大的威胁是水。离庙二里多路有一口水井，水量极少，水味苦。我们节约用水，几天刷一次牙，脸就干脆不洗了。
    沙漠气候变化异常剧烈，“早穿皮衣午披纱，围着火炉吃西瓜”。明明是蓝蓝的晴天，刹那间乌云密布，风沙四起，混混沌沌，像海上生浓雾似的，看不远三、五米以外。飞沙扑打着脸，挣不开眼，辨不清方向。我记得很清楚，去年5月15日下午，原本天气晴朗，我正在野外工作得起劲，突然刮来一阵大风，顷刻间黑云蜂涌，大滴大滴的雨悬空射下，随即转变成鹅毛大雪，纷纷飞来，冻得我直打哆嗦，但我没有退却！
    我们的工作流动性非常大，到处是“家”。每到一个农村，无论是老伯伯、大嫂、青年、孩童，只要见到测量标杆，就都会聚拢来：“嗬，测量队来啦！”“找宝的人来啦！”有的老伯伯摸着他的灰白胡须激动地对我们说：“找宝的人到我们这里来，这是从来也没有过的事！同志，我们这里有什么宝贝吗？”村干部忙着给我们找房子、做饭，……我们到处受到亲人一般的信任和安慰！
    有时候“家”是在城市里，礼拜天就可以看看电影、蹓蹓马路。但我们有我们自己的一套娱乐：有的在理发，有的包饺子，有的出去打黄羊，有的听收音机、打扑克、下棋等等。收音机广播哪个厂矿又超额完成月生产计划的时候，我们就互相祝贺，自豪地说：“也有我们的一点血汗哩！”
    真的，眼看到工作过的地方，修筑了公路、铁路、盖起了选矿厂、开矿场，人迹稀少的原野变为繁闹的城镇，我们的心是多么兴奋、激动、留恋啊！然而，为了未来，为了给祖国多找财富，我们毫不犹豫地背起行装，重新奔向新的、陌生的、荒凉而又有无尽宝藏的土地上……
