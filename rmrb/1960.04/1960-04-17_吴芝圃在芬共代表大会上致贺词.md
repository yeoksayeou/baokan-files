Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Helsinki: Wu Zhipu, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, who was invited to attend the 12th Congress of the Finnish Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Congress on the 16th and read out the congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee to the Congress. The congratulatory speech is as follows:
Dear Comrades:

    Please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to express warm and fraternal congratulations to your Congress, and through the Congress to express sincere respect to the Finnish working class and the Finnish people.

    As the vanguard of the Finnish working class and the Finnish working people, the Finnish Communist Party has waged heroic and arduous struggles for a long time. Your unswerving efforts have brought fruitful results in the post-war years. Your party has made due contributions to the cause of world peace by taking opposition to the imperialist policy of war and striving to defend peace as one of the central tasks of the party. Your party has made continuous efforts to unite the patriotic and democratic forces in the country and has strengthened the friendship with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries by educating the Finnish working class and working people with the spirit of internationalism. Your party has resolutely resisted the attacks of the monopoly capitalist groups on the working people in order to fight for democracy, improve people's lives and social progress, and has thus been increasingly widely supported by the Finnish people. The great victory won by the Finnish Communist Party and its allies in the 1958 general election was by no means accidental, but precisely marked the close ties between your party and the broad masses of the people. We firmly believe that through this Congress, your party will better unite and lead the Finnish working people and democratic forces to achieve new and greater victories in the great cause of realizing socialism in Finland.

    In recent years, we have been pleased to see that the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Finnish parties and between the people of China and Finland have been continuously strengthened. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always been concerned with the struggles and achievements of your party and the Finnish people with friendly feelings. We thank your party for sending a delegation headed by Comrade Ville Pessi to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1956, and last year your party sent a delegation headed by Comrade Aimo Aaltonen to participate in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Our party and people cherish this friendship very much and hope that the friendship between the two parties and the two peoples will continue to be strengthened.

    In recent years, the Chinese Communists and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are carrying out socialist construction with full confidence. We basically completed the second Five-Year Plan from 1958 to 1962 in just two years, from 1958 to 1959. In the future, our country will continue to move forward in accordance with the general line of building socialism in China, with the development speed of the Great Leap Forward and the organizational form of the People's Commune. Our country plans to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in ten years. We firmly believe that with the unity and joint efforts of our people, and with the warm support of the people of all countries, we will certainly be able to accomplish the above-mentioned goals and use this to enhance the strength of the entire socialist world.

    We are very excited to see that: the seven-year plan, which marks the Soviet Union's entry into a new era of comprehensive construction of communist society, is beginning to achieve victorious results; the advanced science, technology and culture of the Soviet Union have gained a leading position in the most important fields of world science and culture; the entire socialist camp is achieving a common upsurge in high-speed development; the workers' movements, national independence movements and movements to defend world peace in various countries are continuing to develop vigorously. With the arrival of the 1960s, even more infinitely beautiful prospects are displayed before us. We are getting better and better every day, and the enemy is rotting day by day. This is exactly the entire world situation.

    Comrades! Opposing the imperialist policy of war and defending world peace remains the most urgent task of the people of all countries in the world. The unremitting efforts made by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions have won increasingly broad support from the people of all countries in the world. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and other countries in Asia and Europe, and the Soviet Union's proposed comprehensive and thorough disarmament plan and measures to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million troops, have had a huge impact on the world. The East-West summit meeting will be held under this situation, which is gratifying. However, people cannot but pay attention to the fact that the most aggressive US imperialism in the imperialist camp, on the one hand, has to take certain gestures to ease the international situation under strong peace pressure, and on the other hand, is stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, expanding missile bases abroad, stepping up the armament of West Germany, and actively reviving Japanese militarism, making West Germany and Japan new sources of war. The peace-loving people of all countries must maintain a high degree of vigilance against this policy pursued by US imperialism. As long as we expose all the conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism at any time and further mobilize the people of the world to fight for the defense of peace, we can defend world peace.

    Dear Comrades! In the face of the current excellent situation, let us hold the banner of Marxism-Leninism even higher, resolutely smash all destructive activities of modern revisionism, and closely unite the working classes and all working people of all countries around the Communist Party to jointly strive for the defense of world peace, the progress of mankind, and the realization of the great cause of socialism!

    Now, please allow me to read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the 12th Congress of the Finnish Communist Party.

      Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the 12th Congress of the Finnish Communist Party
    Dear Comrades:

    On behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm and fraternal congratulations to the 12th Congress of the Finnish Communist Party, and through the Congress to all members of the Finnish Communist Party, the Finnish working class and working people.

    After a long and arduous struggle, the Finnish Communist Party plays an even more important role in Finnish political life today. Your party has achieved outstanding achievements in uniting the Finnish working people and all democratic forces to strengthen the friendship between the people of all countries, especially between Finland and the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to adhere to peaceful coexistence, to strive for democracy, to strive for social progress and to improve the lives of the working people. The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people are very excited about all your achievements.

    We firmly believe that in the current favorable international situation, the Finnish Communist Party, as a militant party with close ties to the masses, will, through this Congress, greatly advance the cause of peace, democracy and socialism.

    Long live the Finnish Communist Party!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Finnish people!

                                  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                                              April 14, 1960

    吴芝圃在芬共代表大会上致贺词
    芬兰共产党同广大人民有着紧密的联系，不断努力团结国内爱国民主力量，在争取民主和社会进步，在加强各国人民之间的友好和保卫世界和平的斗争中获得了卓越的成就。中芬两党和中芬两国人民之间的友谊来往在不断地加强着。反对帝国主义的战争政策，保卫世界和平，仍然是世界各国人民当前最迫切的任务。只要我们随时揭露美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，把全世界人民进一步动员起来，为保卫和平而进行斗争，我们就能保卫住世界和平。
    新华社16日讯　赫尔辛基消息：应邀出席芬兰共产党第十二次代表大会的中国共产党中央委员会代表吴芝圃，16日向代表大会致贺词，并宣读了中共中央给大会的贺电。贺词如下：亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我代表中国共产党中央委员会向你们的代表大会表达热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺，并且通过大会向芬兰工人阶级和芬兰人民表示衷心的敬意。
    作为芬兰工人阶级和芬兰劳动人民的先锋队，芬兰共产党曾在漫长的岁月中进行过英勇而艰苦的斗争。你们的坚持不渝的努力，在战后年代里带来了丰硕的果实。你们党把反对帝国主义的战争政策，争取保卫和平作为党的中心任务之一，从而对世界和平事业作出了应有的贡献。你们党在团结国内爱国民主力量方面作了不断的努力，并且用国际主义的精神去教育芬兰的工人阶级和劳动人民，从而加强了同苏联和其他人民民主国家的友谊。你们党为争取民主、改善人民生活和社会进步，坚决地抵抗了垄断资本集团对于劳动人民的进攻，从而日益广泛地得到了芬兰人民的拥护。在1958年的大选中，芬兰共产党及其盟友所获得的巨大胜利，绝不是偶然的，正是标志着你们党同广大人民有着紧密的联系。我们深信，通过这次大会，你们的党将更好地团结和领导芬兰的劳动人民和民主力量，为在芬兰实现社会主义这一伟大事业而取得新的、更大的胜利。
    近几年来，我们高兴地看到中芬两党和中芬两国人民之间的友谊来往在不断地加强着。中国共产党和中国人民一直怀着友好的心情关心着你们的党和芬兰人民的斗争和成就。我们感谢你们党曾派以维勒·培西同志为首的代表团出席了中国共产党在1956年召开的第八次代表大会，去年你们党又派了以艾摩·阿尔托宁同志为首的代表团参加中华人民共和国成立十周年庆典。我们党和人民非常珍视这种友谊，并希望两党和两国人民之间的友谊继续加强。
    近几年来，中国共产党人和中国人民，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，满怀信心地正在进行着社会主义建设。我们从1958年到1959年的两年时间内，就基本上完成了1958—1962的第二个五年计划。今后我国仍将依照中国建设社会主义的总路线，以大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式向前迈进。我国预定在十年间在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国。我们深信，在我国人民团结一致、共同努力之下，在各国人民的热烈支持之下，我们一定能够完成上述的目标，并将以此来增强整个社会主义世界的力量。
    我们十分兴奋地看到：标志着苏联进入全面建设共产主义社会新时期的七年计划正在开始胜利地取得成果，苏联的先进科学技术和文化在世界科学文化的最重要领域内获得了领先的地位；整个社会主义阵营正在高速度发展中取得共同的高涨；各国工人运动，民族独立运动和保卫世界和平运动正在继续蓬勃地发展。随着二十世纪六十年代的到来，在我们面前展示了更为无限美好的前景。我们一天天好起来，敌人一天天烂下去，整个的世界形势，就完全是这样。
    同志们！反对帝国主义的战争政策，保卫世界和平，仍然是世界各国人民当前的最迫切的任务。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国为了和缓国际紧张局势而进行的不懈努力，获得了世界各国人民越来越广泛的支持。赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国和亚欧其它国家，苏联提出的全面彻底的裁军方案和裁减一百二十万武装部队的措施，在全世界产生了巨大的影响。东西方高级会议就将在这种形势下召开，这是令人高兴的。但是人们不能不注意，帝国主义阵营中最富于侵略性的美帝国主义，一方面在强大的和平压力下不得不采取某些和缓国际局势的姿态，另一方面却在加紧扩军备战，在国外扩充导弹基地，加紧武装西德，积极复活日本军国主义，使西德和日本成为新的战争的策源地。各国爱好和平的人民对于美帝国主义所执行的这种政策，必须保持高度的警惕，只要我们随时揭露美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，把全世界人民进一步动员起来，为保卫和平而进行斗争，我们就能保卫住世界和平。
    亲爱的同志们！让我们在当前大好的形势面前，更加高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，坚决粉碎现代修正主义的一切破坏活动，把各国工人阶级和全体劳动人民紧紧地团结在共产党的周围来为保卫世界和平，争取人类进步和社会主义伟大事业的实现而共同奋斗吧！
    现在，请允许我宣读中国共产党中央委员会致芬兰共产党第十二次代表大会的贺电。
      中国共产党中央委员会致芬兰共产党第十二次代表大会贺电亲爱的同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会代表中国共产党全体党员，谨向芬兰共产党第十二次代表大会、并通过大会向芬兰共产党全体党员、芬兰工人阶级和劳动人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    芬兰共产党经过长期艰苦的斗争，今天在芬兰政治生活中起着更加重要的作用。你们党在团结芬兰劳动人民和一切民主力量为加强各国人民之间、特别是芬兰和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家之间的友谊、坚持和平共处、争取民主、争取社会进步和改善劳动人民生活的斗争中获得了卓越的成就。中国共产党人和中国人民对于你们的一切成就感到十分兴奋。
    我们深信，在目前有利的国际形势之下，作为富有战斗精神和密切联系群众的芬兰共产党，通过这次代表大会，一定会把争取和平、民主和社会主义的事业大大向前推进一步。
    芬兰共产党万岁！
    中芬两国人民的友谊万岁！
                                  中国共产党中央委员会
                                              1960年4月14日
