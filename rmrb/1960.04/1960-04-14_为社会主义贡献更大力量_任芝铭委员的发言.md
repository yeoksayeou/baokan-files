    Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the report by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

    The continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959 has achieved tremendous victories and brilliant accomplishments on all fronts of socialist construction in the motherland, bringing about profound changes in our country's political and economic landscape. Like the rest of the country, Henan, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups in China, Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CCP, has also achieved brilliant accomplishments in the development of the national economy at the speed of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years. To mention just a few major events that I have personally felt most deeply:

    In 1959, Henan suffered a severe drought, the duration and extent of which far exceeded that of 1942. The tragedy of 1942 was scorched earth for miles and the starvation of more than three million people, with over ten million displaced. However, although we encountered the worst drought in seventy or eighty years in 1959, we still achieved a great harvest on the basis of the extraordinary bumper harvest of 1958. The total agricultural output value increased by 21.9%, and grain increased by 13.75%. In the past, Henan suffered great disasters from heavy rains, small disasters from light rains, and droughts when there was no rain. After two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, we have now basically achieved water conservancy, ensuring a good harvest even without rain. This is an astonishing miracle!

    Henan used to be "poor and blank." In the past, there was no iron or steel. After two years of the Great Leap Forward, more than sixty small and medium-sized iron and steel plants have now been established throughout the province. I have also visited several factories. It is truly a sight of "steel flowing day and night, iron seas smelting heroes," which fills people with indescribable joy at first sight.

    The Yellow River, which has been a scourge for thousands of years, is now obediently at our command. The Sanmenxia key project will be basically completed this year. After the completion of this project, the Yellow River will serve irrigation, power generation, and navigation. Here, I would like to specifically mention "Huayuankou." Everyone will remember "Huayuankou." It was here, in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang breached the Yellow River, drowning nine hundred thousand people in Henan alone and creating the horrific Yellow River flood area. Now, the Dongfeng Canal has been built here, benefiting the original Yellow River flood area with irrigation. It is truly "the Yellow River repays its debts, and the disaster area of a thousand years has become a paradise." Let us look at how the people are comparing the past and the present. The couplet on the Dongfeng Canal says: "Hate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for breaching Huayuankou in the past, harming thousands of miles; rejoice today that the Communist Party has built the Dongfeng Canal, benefiting the people." Comparing the past and the present, how can the people not thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

    These achievements alone fully demonstrate that the Party's leadership is extremely wise and the socialist system is incomparably superior. At the same time, it also powerfully demonstrates that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are indeed the three magic weapons and three red banners for promoting the continuous and rapid advancement of our country's socialist construction.

    In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the impetus and inspiration of the Great Leap Forward situation, the Henan organization and members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) have made significant progress. Generally speaking, they have been able to rely on the leadership of the Party, listen to the Party, and follow the Party on the socialist road; they have been able to actively do their work, and many advanced workers and work models have emerged. However, many people still have doubts and resistance to accepting the leadership of the Party and to the three red banners. This shows that duality still exists and that the political stance has not been fundamentally transformed. In the future, we must continue to work hard and strengthen our transformation in accordance with the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, and contribute more and greater strength to the cause of socialism.

    Although I am old and frail, I will never be humble. I will live and learn as long as I live, and strive for continuous transformation and continuous progress.

    I wish the conference a successful conclusion and everyone good health.

### 为社会主义贡献更大力量  任芝铭委员的发言

    为社会主义贡献更大力量
    任芝铭委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并竭诚拥护李富春、李先念副总理的报告，和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，在祖国社会主义建设的各个战线上，都取得巨大的胜利和辉煌的成就，使我国政治经济面貌发生了深刻变化。我们河南同全国一样，在伟大的中国共产党和全国各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席英明领导下，在中共河南省委直接领导下，两年来，国民经济的发展，也是以大跃进的速度，取得了辉煌的成就。不说别的，拿我感受最深的几桩大事来说说吧。
    1959年，河南遭到了严重的旱灾，其干旱时间之长，面积之广，都远远超过1942年，1942年的惨状是赤地千里，饿死了三百多万人，流离失所者在千万人以上，而1959年虽然遇到七八十年来未有的大旱灾，却在1958年特大丰收的基础上，又取得了大丰收。农业总产值比1958年增长21.9％，粮食增长13.75％。过去河南大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾，经过两年的连续大跃进，现在已基本上实现了水利化，做到无雨保丰收。这是惊人的奇迹！
    河南原是“一穷二白”，过去没有钢铁，经过两年大跃进，现在全省已建立起六十多个中小型钢铁厂。我也曾到几个厂里去看过，真是“钢流奔日夜，铁海炼英雄”，使人一看，内心有说不出的高兴。
    千载为害的黄河，现在要驯服地听我们使唤。三门峡总枢纽工程，今年就要基本完成，这一工程完成后，黄河就要为灌溉、发电、航运服务。这里，我要特别提一提“花园口”。“花园口”这个地方，大家都会记得，在抗日战争初期，蒋介石匪帮，就是在这里扒开黄河，仅河南就淹死九十万人，造成惨绝人寰的黄泛区。现在这里已修建了东风渠，使原有的黄泛区都受到灌溉之利。真是“黄河欠债黄河还，千年灾区变乐园”。我们再看人民是怎样作今昔对比的，东风渠上的联语说：“恨昔日蒋匪帮扒开花园口为害千里；喜今朝共产党修建东风渠造福人民”。今昔一对比，人民怎能不感谢共产党，感谢毛主席呢！
    仅就这些成就，已充分说明，党的领导十分英明，社会主义制度无比优越。同时，也有力地说明，总路线、大跃进、人民公社，确是推动我国社会主义建设事业不断飞速前进的三个法宝，三面红旗。
    几年来，在共产党的领导，在大跃进形势的推动鼓舞下，民革河南组织和成员，都有显著的进步，一般说来，都能依靠党的领导，听党的话，跟着党走社会主义道路；能积极做好工作，出现不少先进工作者和工作模范。但是，也有不少人对接受党的领导，对三面红旗，还或多或少地存在着怀疑和抵触。这说明两面性依然存在，政治立场还未得到根本改造。今后必须按照毛主席提出的六项政治标准，继续努力，加强改造，为社会主义事业贡献更多更大的力量。
    我虽衰杇残年，决不自卑，我要活到老学到老，为不断改造，不断进步而奋斗。
    敬祝大会胜利成功，各位身体健康。
