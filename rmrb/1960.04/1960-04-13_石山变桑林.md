Representative Shen Fengying said: Our production team is surrounded by sixteen large mountains. Before liberation, the mountains were bare, with no vegetation, and frequent mountain floods. After liberation, especially after the establishment of people's communes, the landscape changed rapidly. The bare mountains have been planted with dense mulberry forests.

Comrades,

My home is in Wanshi Production Team, Xindeng Commune, Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province. Before liberation, under the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the peasants lived a very impoverished life. At that time, the sixteen large mountains surrounding our production team were bare, with no vegetation, and mountain floods occurred frequently. If you wanted to plant crops on the mountains, you often lost even your capital. There was a saying among the peasants: "Walking the cat and raccoon road, eating chaff and vegetable cakes, sleeping in a straw nest, wearing coir rain cape and hemp cloth shoes." After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the appearance of my hometown changed rapidly. In particular, after the thorough implementation of the General Line, the realization of the Great Leap Forward, and the establishment of the People's Commune, there was a truly earth-shaking transformation. The bare mountains have been planted with a large number of dense mulberry forests.

The slogan "Mulberry Trees Up the Mountains" was put forward in 1955. At that time, we established a cooperative with more than 600 households. According to the natural characteristics of having more mountains and less land, the Party committee led us to advance into the stone mountains. The broad masses resolutely responded to the Party's call, not afraid of how fierce the northwest wind was, or how high the mountain peaks were, and they went to the mountains to open up wasteland with their bedding and pots. It was a vigorous and bustling scene with everyone joining. At that time, landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to sabotage, spreading rumors such as "mountains upon mountains, no end to suffering," and a few wealthy peasants also wavered, pessimistically saying, "Barren mountains are difficult to plant with mulberry trees." However, the broad masses of commune members were full of confidence, expressing their determination to "never retreat without completing the task." Under the leadership of the Party branch, a great debate was launched on the issues of mulberry trees going up the mountains and turning stone mountains into treasure mountains, crushing the attacks of the landlords and rich peasants, persuading the wavering people, and successfully completing the task of opening up wasteland.

By the spring of 1956, the newly opened mountain land urgently needed to be planted with mulberry trees, but there were no funds to buy mulberry seedlings. Seeing that the busy season of spring plowing was approaching, time could not be delayed any longer. The Party branch proposed self-reliance, calling on Party members to take the lead in investing in mulberry seedlings. I took the lead by investing fifty yuan. As a result, many people competed to invest. In this way, we planted the first batch of 100,000 mulberry seedlings.

As the area expanded, the labor force for cultivating mulberry trees became increasingly insufficient. The Party led us to organize a professional team of more than 500 people. During the busy farming season, they went down the mountains to rush planting and harvesting, and during the slack season, everyone went up the mountains together to open up wasteland and plant mulberry trees, temporarily alleviating the labor shortage.

However, these many mulberry seedlings had to be purchased from other places, increasing the expenses of the commune members, and there would be no income in the current year. We studied this problem. In order to better implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, and to prepare conditions for long-term mulberry planting and silkworm rearing in the future, we set up our own mulberry seedling nursery and relied on our own efforts to solve the problem of mulberry seedlings.

Year after year, we planted mulberry trees, and the leaf yield increased year after year. Silkworm rearing production has greatly developed. The commune members saw the benefits of "developing sericulture, benefiting the country and the family," and demanded that all stone mountains be turned into mulberry forests. However, the cooperative was small and its strength was limited. At this time, the people's commune was established, the scale of the production team was expanded, and the wishes of the masses were quickly realized. Since communization, the enthusiasm of the commune members for harnessing mountains and rivers and greening barren mountains has been greatly increased. A new situation has emerged in which mountains are opened up every season and mulberry trees are planted every year. In the three years before 1957, 500,000 mulberry trees were planted. In the two years of 1958 and 1959, another 1.25 million mulberry trees were planted. Since the beginning of this year, 600,000 trees have been planted. While grasping the expansion of planting, we also grasped cultivation, overcoming the backward situation of harvesting nothing after planting mulberry trees, and enabling the barren stone mountains to grow strong mulberry trees.

As the leaf yield increased, the number of silkworms raised also increased rapidly. This year, we can raise 8,000 sheets of silkworms. Recently, under the leadership of the Party, we have carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution and launched a self-reliant movement to reform silkworm rearing tools. At present, the mechanization of silkworm rearing has been basically realized, with twenty-one new tools forming a complete set. The commune has also established a silkworm seed farm. Last year, it produced 45,000 sheets of silkworm eggs, and this year it plans to produce 135,000 sheets, which will not only solve its own silkworm egg problem, but also supply the needs of the entire county. In carrying out the reform of silkworm rearing tools, we put forward the slogan "one idea from each person, farmers make machines." Everyone actively contributed ideas and materials, saving a large amount of labor and funds. After the reform of silkworm rearing tools, we also focused on vigorously training technical talents, adopting methods such as learning from others, conducting on-the-spot competitions, learning from the advanced, and holding on-site meetings when there was experience, and cultivated more than 200 "local experts."

After the mulberry trees went up the mountains, the damage from floods and droughts was greatly reduced, and the all-round Great Leap Forward of production was promoted. After raising silkworms, silkworm excrement can be used to feed pigs and as fertilizer to improve paddy fields. In 1959, the average grain yield per mu was 1,206 jin, an increase of 39.42% over the previous year, and more than six times the increase before liberation. The total output of silkworm cocoons was 1,444 dan, an increase of 78.27% over 1958, and the yield of cocoons per sheet of silkworm eggs increased from more than 20 jin before liberation to more than 70 jin. The number of live pigs reached 1.4 per mu of cultivated land. The average net income per person in the entire production team was 150 yuan, an increase of 35% over the previous year.

With the rapid development of the socialist construction of the motherland, our future is even more brilliant. By 1962, our production team will develop to 10 million mulberry trees, achieving no mountain without green, all waters clear, and an all-round Great Leap Forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

    石山变桑林
    沈凤英代表说：我们生产队周围有十六座大山。解放前，山光秃秃的，不长草木，经常山洪爆发。解放以后，特别是办起了人民公社，面貌改变得很快，光秃的山上，已经种上密密的桑林。各位代表：
    我的家住在浙江桐庐县新登公社万市生产队。解放前，在国民党反动政府的压迫和剥削下，农民过着十分贫困的生活，那时，我们生产队周围十六座大山，光秃秃的，不长草木，经常发生山洪爆发，要想在山上种点农作物，常常连老本都蚀进去。农民中间流传着这样一句话：走的猫狸路，吃的糠菜粿，困的稻草窝，穿的箬壳草鞋加麻布。解放以后，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，家乡的面貌改变得很快，特别是贯彻执行了总路线，实现了大跃进，办起了人民公社以后，真是起了翻天复地的变化。光秃的山上，已经种上了一大批密密麻麻的桑树林。
    桑树上山的口号，是在1955年提出来的。那时，我们办了一个六百多户的合作社。党委根据山多田少的自然特点，领导我们向石山进军。广大群众坚决响应了党的号召，不怕西北风多么猛，山头有多么高，纷纷带被背锅上山开荒，人山人海干得十分起劲。当时，地富分子乘机破坏，散布“山头山头，苦不出头”的谣言，少数富裕农民也动摇了，他们悲观地说：“不毛之山难栽桑”。而广大社员却信心十足，表示了“不完成任务决不收兵”的决心。在党支部的领导下，开展了桑树上山、石山变宝山问题的大辩论，粉碎了地富分子的进攻，说服了动摇的人，顺利地完成了开荒任务。
    到了1956年春，新开的山地急待栽桑，可是没有资金买桑苗，眼看春耕大忙时节快要到来，时间不能再拖了。党支部提出自力更生，号召党员带头投资买桑苗，我带头投资了五十元，结果许多人纷纷相争投资，就这样，我们栽下了第一批十万株桑苗。
    随着面积扩大，栽培桑树的劳动力越来越不够用了，党领导我们组织了五百多人的专业队，农忙时下山抢种抢收，农闲时又全民一齐上山开荒栽桑，劳力紧张情况暂时缓和下来。
    但是，这许多桑苗要从外地采购，增加了社员的开支，当年得不到收益。我们研究了这个问题，为了更好地执行勤俭办社的方针，并为今后长期的种桑养蚕准备条件，我们自己办起育桑苗圃，自力更生解决桑苗。
    年年栽桑，产叶量年年增加，养蚕生产有了很大发展，社员们看到了“发展蚕桑，利国利家”的好处，要求将所有石山变成桑林。但是社小，力量有限。正在这个时候，人民公社建立了，生产队的规模扩大了，群众的愿望也很快地实现了。自从公社化以来，大大提高了社员治山治水，绿化荒山的积极性，出现了季季开山，年年栽桑的新局面。1957年以前三年的时间栽了桑树五十万株，1958、1959年两年又栽了一百二十五万株，今年以来已种六十万株。一手抓扩种，一手抓培育，克服了桑树白种白收的落后状况，使瘠薄的石头山生长了粗壮的桑树。
    随着产叶量增加，养蚕的数量也很快增加了，今年可以养蚕八千张。最近，我们在党的领导下，发扬了不断革命精神，自力更生开展养蚕工具改革运动，目前已基本实现了养蚕机械化，如二十一种新工具配套成龙。公社还办起了蚕种场，去年已制蚕种四万五千张，今年计划制十三万五千张，不但解决自己的蚕种问题，还可供应全县需要。在开展蚕具改革中，我们提出了“一人一条计，农民造机器”口号，大家积极献计献料，节省大批劳力和资金。养蚕工具改革以后，又抓住大力培养技术人材，采用登门取经，就地比武，有先进就学，有经验就开现场会办法，培养了二百多名“土专家”。
    桑树上山以后，洪旱灾害大大减少，而且促进了生产的全面大跃进。养蚕以后，蚕沙（蚕粪）可以喂猪，还可以当肥料，改良澜水田。1959年粮食平均亩产一千二百零六斤，比上年增加39.42％，比解放前增加六倍以上。蚕茧总产量一千四百四十四担，比1958年增加78.27％，每张蚕种产茧量由解放前二十多斤增加到七十多斤。生猪实现每亩耕地一点四头，全生产队每人纯收入平均一百五十元，比上年增加35％。
    随着祖国社会主义建设飞跃发展，我们的前途更为光辉灿烂，到1962年，我们生产队将发展到一千万株桑树，实现无山不绿，有水皆清，农林牧副渔，全面大跃进。
