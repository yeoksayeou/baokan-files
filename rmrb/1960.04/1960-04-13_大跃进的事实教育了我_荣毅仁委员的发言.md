The facts of the Great Leap Forward Educated Me
Speech by Committee Member Rong Yiren

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

As long as one is not deaf or blind, every Chinese person living in such a vibrant society will personally hear and see the colorful and ever-changing events of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, which are rapidly changing our country's "poor and blank" state. They will feel happy, encouraged, and deeply appreciate the boundless power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes – the three magic weapons of socialist construction – as guided by the Party and Chairman Mao. During my visit to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company in Wuhan, the company's负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) told me that the first 100- to 120-meter-high chimney took 180 days to build, the second took 87 days, the third 45 days, the fourth 12 days, and the most recently completed fifth one took 9 days and 4 hours. From 180 days to 9 days and 4 hours, the difference is almost a ratio of 20 to 1. What a huge change! In Chongqing, I visited the Chaotianmen Grain Processing Factory. This factory originally had three old rice milling machines, with sixty or seventy workers engaged in heavy and busy labor. During the Great Steel Making Campaign of the previous year, they had to support the "marshal's rise to power" of steel while also ensuring the grain supply. So, they used their brains, looked for tricks, and engaged in technical revolution. They modified this part a little, and that part a little, and now, from the input of rice to the output of polished rice being weighed and stored, it's all connected. Plus, there's an automatic control console pieced together from waste materials. Only one person is needed to calmly and comfortably operate the entire processing process in the automatic control room, and the output has more than doubled. From the heavy labor of sixty or seventy people to the work of one person, what a huge change! In Santai, I visited the Feima People's Commune. This commune is vigorously developing industry. One factory uses local equipment to manufacture fibers and fertilizers from inexpensive straw, which can be used for textile and papermaking, supporting industrial and agricultural production. What a huge change! These examples are just a small part of what I have seen recently, and what I have seen is only a tiny part of the thousands of changes taking place across the country. But it can be seen that whether in cities or the countryside, in large or small industries, a magnificent and vigorous mass movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is unfolding, rapidly changing the face of production, construction, and society. With the leadership of the Party and the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, we can confidently affirm that our country's grand economic plan for this year will definitely be successfully completed.

The facts of the Great Leap Forward have also given me extremely profound education. The vast majority of technological innovations and technological revolutions are initiated by ordinary workers and peasants. The examples above, in terms of science and technology, do not require profound scientific knowledge or a high level of technical expertise to achieve. As long as one has a certain level of scientific and technical expertise, one can think of them and achieve them. But these achievements were not made by experts and great intellectuals, but precisely by the most ordinary working people. They discussed together, sought advice from teachers and friends, worked hard, and were not afraid of difficulties, and finally succeeded. I went to school from elementary to university for sixteen years, and I have also been involved in industry for several years, and I know some superficial knowledge. I thought I had my own set of ideas. After seeing these facts, I cannot help but ask myself, why, although I have some culture and the Party and the people have made good arrangements and taken care of me in all aspects, giving me ample opportunities to serve socialism, haven't I played a role in the socialist cause like the working people? At the same time, in my attitude towards the working people, although I have been constantly nurtured by the Party and educated by facts for several years, I have criticized the idea that "illiterates" know anything and admitted that they also have their own set of ideas. But the idea that they have their own set, and I have my own set has not been resolved. The facts of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years have made me sincerely admit that the wisdom of the working people is endless, the collective strength is great, and my own little bit of cultural knowledge is insignificant in comparison.

Why didn't they do this before liberation? This precisely shows that under the old society and the old system, cruel rule, oppression, and exploitation forced the working people to live in poverty and suffering, making it impossible for them to develop their talents. After liberation, the workers and peasants became masters of their own destiny. When Chairman Mao put forward the General Line and gave the brilliant instruction of "breaking superstitions and emancipating the mind," it immediately inspired everyone to go all out with soaring energy and enthusiasm for labor, like mercury pouring onto the ground, penetrating everywhere, working day and night as if they were obsessed. In the Nanchong Silk Second Factory, I met some female workers, one of whom had only shed her illiteracy in 1958. She recited several poems from the Red Flag Songbook and explained her understanding and feelings to me. She composed a poem on the spot and recited it, expressing her loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao and her love for the socialist cause. She also mentioned that she had written a poem about silk reeling, in which she likened the silkworm cocoons to dance partners, the water trough on the silk reeling machine to a small stream, and the sound of the motor to music. Her silk reeling work was like dancing happily with the silkworm cocoons by the small stream to the rhythm of the music. I couldn't remember her poems, but her rich imagination deeply touched me, and her deep feeling of regarding labor as a pleasant necessity of life will forever be etched in my heart! Her feelings towards labor are the feelings of millions of working people. The working people have been liberated politically and economically, and also ideologically liberated. The calls and instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao immediately became a huge driving force, fully developing their labor, wisdom, and enthusiasm, making a great revolution in technology and culture, and forming a situation of continuous Great Leap Forward. They are infinitely loyal to the Party, enthusiastically cherish the socialist cause, and have deep feelings for labor. They do not haggle over private interests or personal gains and losses. They are wholeheartedly committed to changing the "poor and blank" face of the motherland into a prosperous, strong, and happy socialist society. This is the fundamental difference between the working people and us bourgeois elements. This is the concrete example for the industrialists and businessmen that the Party calls on us to "take one side" and "lean to one side" to learn from.

Through my recent inspection work, my ideological understanding has undergone some changes, making me once again realize the unparalleled correctness of the Party's policy of instructing us industrialists and businessmen to carry out self-education and self-transformation in participating in socialist construction. Self-transformation can be carried out in any work, allowing me to further realize that Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse for our progress. I am determined to humbly learn from the working people under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and in the practical work of actively participating in socialist construction, I will conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, constantly transform my bourgeois stand and worldview, and contribute my strength to this year's Great Leap Forward and the continued Great Leap Forward in the future.

### 大跃进的事实教育了我  荣毅仁委员的发言

专栏：

    大跃进的事实教育了我
    荣毅仁委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理和陈叔通副主席所作的报告。
    只要不是充耳不闻、闭目不视，每一个中国人民生活在这样一个生气勃勃的社会里，就会亲耳听到、亲眼看到全面大跃进中间的万紫千红、千变万化的事迹，正在迅速地改变着我国“一穷二白”的面貌，而感到欢欣鼓舞、振奋人心，更深切的体会到党和毛主席所指引的总路线、大跃进、人民公社这社会主义建设的三大法宝的威力无边。我在武汉参观了武汉钢铁公司，这个公司的负责人告诉我一个一百米到一百二十米高的烟囱在第一个建造的时候花了一百八十天，第二个花了八十七天，第三个四十五天，第四个十二天，到最近建成的第五个，花了九天四小时。从一百八十天到九天四小时，相差几乎是二十与一之比，这是多么大的变化！在重庆我参观了朝天门粮食加工厂，这个厂原来是三套旧碾米机，有六、七十个工人进行着繁重而忙碌的劳动，在前年大炼钢铁的时候，既要支援钢铁元帅升帐，又要保证粮食供应，他们就开动脑筋、找窍门，闹技术革命，这一部分改一些，那一部分改一些，到现在从谷子进机到白米过磅进仓穿成一套，再加上一座用废材旧料拼成的自动控制台，只要一个人就能定定心心、舒舒适适的在自动控制室里操纵着整个加工过程，而且产量增加了一倍以上。从六、七十人的繁重劳动而变为一个人的工作，这是多么大的变化！到三台我参观了飞马人民公社，这个公社正大办工业，中间有一个工厂利用土设备，从廉价的蓑草中制造了可以用于纺织和造纸的纤维和肥料，支援了工农业生产，这是多么大的变化！这些事例只是我最近所见到的一部分，而我所见到的又仅仅是在全国千变万化中极小的一部分，但是可以看到不论在城市和农村、大工业和小工业，正在开展着一个波澜壮阔、气势磅礴的以技术革新、技术革命为中心的群众运动，迅速地改变生产建设和社会的面貌。我们有党的领导，全国人民的共同努力，完全可以肯定我国今年的宏伟的经济计划一定能够胜利完成。
    大跃进的事实，对我还有极其深刻的教育。绝大多数的技术革新、技术革命都是普通的工人农民搞起来的。上面的几个事例，就科学技术来说，并不是需要有深奥的科学知识、高度的技术水平才能做到的，只要有一定的科学技术水平就能想得出、做得到的。但是这些事迹，并不是专家大知识分子搞起来的，而恰恰是由极其普通的劳动人民搞成功的，他们在一起商量讨论、寻师访友、刻苦钻研、不怕困难，终于成功了。我是从小学到大学曾经十六年窗下，又曾搞过几年工业，懂得一些皮毛，自己认为也有一套。看了这些事实，不能不扪心自问，为什么虽然有了一些文化而且党和人民在各方面给我作了很好的安排和照顾，有着充分为社会主义效力的机会，但是就没有像劳动人民一样的为社会主义事业发挥作用呢？同时，在对待劳动人民的态度上，虽然经过了几年党的不断培养和事实的教育，批判了“老粗”懂得什么的思想而承认他们也有一套。但是他们有一套，我也有一套的思想并没有解决。这两年大跃进的事实，使我不能不心悦诚服地承认劳动人民的智慧无穷尽，集体力量的伟大，而我个人那一点点的文化知识，相比起来真是微不足道。
    为什么就是他们，在解放前就没有这样做呢？这正说明在旧社会旧制度之下，残酷的统治、压迫、剥削，迫使劳动人民处在贫困、痛苦的生活中间，无法来发挥他们的才能。而在解放之后，工农劳动人民作了主人，当毛主席提出了总路线，又作了“破除迷信、解放思想”的英明指示，立即启发了大家鼓足了冲天干劲，劳动热情，好似水银泻地，无孔不入，不分昼夜，着了迷似的干起来了。我在南充丝二厂会到了一些女工同志，中间有一位是在1958年才摘了文盲帽子，她背诵了几首红旗歌谱中的诗歌，给我讲解了她的体会感受；她当场做了一首诗朗诵起来，表达了她对党和毛主席的忠诚和对社会主义事业的热爱；她又谈到她曾做过一首缫丝的诗，她把蚕茧当作舞伴，缫丝车上的水槽比作小河溪，马达声听作音乐，她的缫丝工作就是和蚕茧一起在小河溪畔随着音乐的节奏欢乐的舞蹈。我没有能记住她的诗句，她的丰富的想像力深深的感动着我，而她把劳动看作愉快的生活必需的深厚的感情，更将永远的记在我的心头！她对劳动的感情，就是千百万劳动人民的感情。劳动人民在政治上、经济上解放了，又在思想上获得了解放，党和毛主席的号召和指示，立即成为巨大的推动力量，把他们的劳动、智慧、干劲充分发挥起来，大闹技术革命、文化革命，形成了不断大跃进的局面。他们对党无限忠诚，对社会主义事业热忱爱护，对劳动有着深厚的感情；他们并没有斤斤计较私人利益，个人得失；他们一心一意要把祖国“一穷二白”的面貌改变成为繁荣、富强、幸福的社会主义社会；这就是劳动人民和我们资产阶级分子的根本区别，这就是党号召我们工商业者“顾一头”、“一边倒”的具体学习的榜样。
    通过最近的视察工作，使我思想认识上又起了一些变化，使我又一次体会到党指示我们工商业者在参加社会主义建设工作中进行自我教育自我改造的政策的无比正确，在任何工作中间都可以进行自我改造，使我进一步认识到毛泽东思想就是我们前进中的灯塔。我坚决地要在党和毛主席的英明领导下，虚心向劳动人民学习，在积极参加社会主义建设事业的工作实践中，认真学习毛泽东思想，不断的改造自己的资产阶级立场和世界观，为今年的大跃进和今后的继续大跃进贡献自己的力量。
