    Lenin in the Hearts of Peasants
    Lin Shuanquan, Member of the Honeycomb People's Commune, Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province

    I am a member of a people's commune, and in my spare time, I often read newspapers and some theoretical books, such as Chairman Mao's "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and Lenin's writings on the proletarian dictatorship and the worker-peasant alliance. The members of our production team all know that Lenin was the great teacher and leader of the working people of the world, and that the Soviet Union is our elder brother and our good friend.

    This year, April 22nd, marks the ninetieth anniversary of Comrade Lenin's birth, and the proletariat and progressive humanity all over the world (including us working peasants) are celebrating this anniversary with respectful and grateful hearts. The peasants gratefully say that if it were not for the guidance of Leninism, and the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we poor peasants would never have been able to stand up, and sitting in the public canteen eating this fragrant and delicious food would have been unimaginable. In the old society, we worried about firewood, rice, oil, and salt all day long, but now we don't worry about clothing or food, and our labor enthusiasm has increased a hundredfold.

    Although Lenin passed away more than thirty years ago, his name will forever live in our hearts. Lenin's thought is as stable as Mount Tai, unafraid of violent winds or rainstorms, like a lighthouse that will never be extinguished, illuminating the working people of the world to liberation, to victory, and to a happy life. Lenin's doctrine shines with infinite brilliance like a never-setting sun, guiding the revolutionary movement of the proletariat all over the world. When Lenin was alive, there was only one socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, and there were not many Communists. Today, there are more than a dozen socialist countries in the world, and more than 33 million Communists in more than 70 countries, forming a powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Chairman Mao pointed out: The characteristic of the current international situation is that the East wind prevails over the West wind, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. Although the enemy is still clamoring and妄想 to launch wars of aggression, the socialist forces have greatly exceeded the imperialist forces, and the forces of peace far exceed the forces of war. This is the victory of Leninism, and the result of the heroic struggle of the working people of the world under the banner of Lenin and under the correct leadership of the Communist Parties of various countries.

    Lenin's relationship with the Chinese people was very close. He was very concerned about the Chinese revolution from the very beginning, and gave infinite care and sympathy to our country's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle in the early days of the revolution. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, based on the historical characteristics of Chinese society, creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the practice of the Chinese revolution. For more than thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party has held high the banner of Leninism and defeated all foreign enemies, and only then has it achieved such a great victory today.

    Today, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our peasants have all joined the people's communes. Under the illumination of the general line lighthouse and encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, we are moving forward with heroic strides, everyone feeling happy and everyone's enthusiasm is soaring. If the sky does not rain, we will march into the earth's crust to extract water. Everyone has the new idea of "man can conquer nature" and soaring enthusiasm. The Party called on us to "take pig raising as the key link and promote the simultaneous development of the six domestic animals," so we built pigsties in the face of severe cold. After a nationwide debate, we broke through the feed barrier. Now, our entire management area has achieved the goal of one and a half pigs per person, and we are striving to reach the goal of two pigs per person before this year's National Day. In order to combat drought and preserve moisture, seize the seasons, and plant in a timely manner, the commune members are full of energy, getting up early and going to bed late, and full of enthusiasm. The task of planting more than 2,000 mu of spring wheat has been completed ahead of schedule. We must work hard, practically, and cleverly, everyone being red, diligent, and skillful, everyone having full confidence, and trying every means to produce more grain, support national construction, and strive for a greater harvest this year. We must ensure that we achieve the Great Leap Forward target of increasing grain production by 10% compared to last year, as stipulated by the Central Committee.

    In order to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Comrade Lenin's birth, in addition to completing the production tasks of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, we peasants must also earnestly study Lenin's theory, study Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, completely eliminate the old private ownership concepts, and think of the collective in everything. We must work together with the working class elder brother to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture as soon as possible, and realize our peasants' dream of "no oil for lighting lamps, and no oxen for plowing and grinding flour."

    农民心中的列宁
    山西省五寨县蜜蜂人民公社社员　林栓全
    我是人民公社的一个社员，在业余时间常看报，也读过一些理论书籍，如毛主席著作的“中国革命和中国共产党”，列宁有关无产阶级专政和工农联盟的著作等。我们生产队的队员，都知道列宁是全世界劳动人民的伟大导师和领袖，知道苏联是我们的老大哥，是我们的好朋友。
    今年的4月22日是列宁同志诞生九十周年，全世界无产阶级和进步人类（包括我们劳动农民）都怀着崇敬的感激心情庆祝这个纪念节日。农民们感激地说，要不是列宁主义思想的指导，没有中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，我们穷苦农民永远也翻不了身，坐在公共食堂里吃这香喷喷的菜饭是作梦也想不到的事情。在旧社会里成天为柴米油盐发愁，现在穿不愁，吃不愁，劳动干劲百倍增。
    列宁去世虽已三十多年了，他的名字却永远活在我们的心中。列宁的思想，稳如泰山，不怕狂风吹，不怕暴雨冲，像一座永远吹不息灭的灯塔，照耀着全世界劳动人民走向解放，走向胜利，走向幸福生活。列宁的学说像永远不落的太阳放射着万丈光芒，指导着全世界无产阶级的革命运动。列宁活着的时候世界上只有一个社会主义国家苏联，共产党员也不多，今天世界上已有十几个社会主义国家了，七十多个国家拥有三千三百多万共产党员，组成了以苏联老大哥为首的强大无比的社会主义阵营。
    毛主席指出：当前国际形势的特点，是东风压倒西风，敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。现在虽然敌人还在叫喊，妄想发动侵略战争，但社会主义力量已大大超过帝国主义力量，和平力量远远超过战争力量。这是列宁主义的胜利，是全世界劳动人民在列宁的旗帜下和在各国共产党的正确领导下英勇斗争的结果。
    列宁和我们中国人民的关系是非常密切的，他老人家很早就极关心中国的革命事业，对我国革命初起时的反帝反封建的斗争曾给予无限的关怀与同情。毛主席和党中央根据中国社会的历史特点，把马列主义创造性地运用在中国革命实践中。中国革命三十多年，中国共产党高举着列宁主义的旗帜，战胜了一切国外敌人，才取得了今天这样伟大的胜利。
    今天，我们农民在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下全体加入了人民公社，在总路线灯塔的照耀下，在大跃进的鼓舞下，迈着英雄的步伐，人人心情舒畅，个个干劲冲天。老天不下雨，我们就向地层进军入地取水，大家都具有“人定胜天”的新思想和冲天的干劲。党号召我们“以养猪为纲，六畜齐兴”，我们就冒着严寒修建猪舍，经过全民辩论，突破了饲料关，现在我们全管理区实现了一人一口半猪的指标，争取在今年国庆节前要达到一人二口猪的指标。为了抗旱保墒，抓住节气，及时抢种，社员们精神饱满，早起晚睡，干劲十足，两千多亩的春小麦播种任务已提前完成。我们要苦干、实干加巧干，人人红勤巧，个个信心足，千方百计地多产粮食，支援国家大建设，争取今年更大丰收，一定要保证达到中央规定的粮食比去年增长10％的跃进指标。
    为了纪念列宁同志诞生九十周年，我们农民除完成农林牧副渔的生产任务外，还要认真地学习列宁的理论，学习毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，彻底消灭旧的私有观念，处处为集体着想，要和工人老大哥一道，把我们的国家尽快地建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，实现我们农民“点灯不用油，耕地磨面不用牛”的梦想。
