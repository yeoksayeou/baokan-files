Committee Member Gao Yihan's Speech:

I listened to the work report of the Standing Committee given by Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC, and attended the National People's Congress, where I heard Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the 1960 draft national budget. These reports presented a magnificent picture of the continued leap forward in our national economy, which made me extremely excited and I express my warm support.

I personally feel honored to have participated in the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee's Grand Canal Project慰问团（consolation group） in December of last year, personally participating in the慰问（consolation） at the Grand Canal construction site in the Huaiyin Special Zone, and visited the Northern Jiangsu water conservancy projects nearby. I witnessed with my own eyes the people of Northern Jiangsu rousing their soaring drive, under the leadership of the Party, creating a great miracle of transforming nature unprecedented in ancient times.

The Past Canal: Riverbeds Silted, Regularly Flooding and Causing Disaster

As we all know, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal is a great project in Chinese history comparable to the Great Wall and the earliest and largest artificial river in the world. For more than two thousand years, on the one hand, it has played a significant role in the politics, economy, military, transportation, and cultural exchange of past dynasties; on the other hand, because it has been neglected for a long time, the riverbed is silted, large waters cause the dikes to collapse and disasters to occur, and floods inundate, while small waters hinder navigation and cut off traffic. Especially when floods caused disasters, the lives and property of millions of people along the river were repeatedly damaged. What impressed me the most was the tragic situation of the major breach of the eastern dike of the canal in 1931.

At that time, I was working in the偽監察院（pseudo Supervisory Yuan） of the reactionary government in Nanjing. After the news came on August 26 that twenty-six breaches had occurred in the eastern dike of the Li Canal, the 偽監察院（pseudo Supervisory Yuan） immediately sent me to inspect, investigate, and pursue responsibility. According to the investigation materials: the water of the Huai River was high, filling Hongze Lake and Gaobao Lake, and the water level was as high as the top of the dike, which was the truth. But at that time, the reactionary government not only did not try to rescue the situation, but disregarded the lives and property of millions of people in the Li-Xiahe area and opened the归海三坝（Guihai Three Dams） in the dark of night, vainly trying to lower the water level of the canal. It happened that the northwest wind was strong, and the waves directly hit the eastern dike, causing as many as twenty-six breaches in the dike from Gaoyou downwards. More than a dozen counties in Li-Xiahe were flooded, and all the fields and houses were submerged. More than 2,000 people were drowned in the挡军楼（Dangjunlou） and 荷花塘（Hehuatang）breaches alone. When I arrived in Gaoyou County from Yangzhou on September 1, I personally saw refugees along the dike sleeping on the dike, without a grain of rice, enduring hunger and waiting for relief. When the relief饅頭（steamed buns） arrived, they were糜烂（ decayed and not edible） and could not be eaten. I saw the children crying and the women weeping on the dike, a tragic scene that I could not forget for the rest of my life.

Comparing what I saw at the Grand Canal construction site this time with the situation at that time, it can be seen that these are fundamentally different two worlds. Originally, the disasters caused by the canal had their natural causes, but the main reason was social. According to historical records, so-called "natural disasters" are mostly caused by "man-made disasters." In the era of reactionary rule, engineering institutions were also established in various sections of the canal, and横征暴敛（levied exorbitant taxes） under the guise of "guiding the Huai River." The characteristics of the reactionary government's governance of the Huai River at that time were: (1) Seeking temporary solutions but not fundamental ones. They never had the intention of "fundamentally治淮河（governing the Huai River）", but only wanted to place a group of idle people in various sections of the canal, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, without ever doing the work of widening and deepening the riverbed. (2) Employing novices and excluding veterans. They claimed to adopt Western methods, wiping out thousands of years of traditional water management experience, and excluding the original river workers completely, resulting in a sharp struggle between the old and new factions. (3) Reactionary government officials were enemies of the people everywhere, and when faced with an emergency, they could not mobilize the masses. When a big flood came, the river workers watched millions of people suffer and left. Because of this, on the eve of August 26, 1931, all the river workers watched the dike in danger, had no way to deal with it, and had to secretly withdraw all the employees back to Zhenjiang in the dark of night, leaving hundreds of miles of dikes unguarded, so that the people along the river cried to the heavens without response and sought help from the earth without result. To this day, the people of Gaoyou still say this when recalling the tragic situation of the past disasters: "When we think of the day when the canal collapsed in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, our hearts ache." These few words they said are also what I want to say in my heart.

The Current Canal: Granaries, Cotton Seas, a New "Land of Fish and Rice"

This time, when I went to the Grand Canal construction site again, it was truly another world. In terms of transportation, due to the rapid development of industry and agriculture and the continuous improvement of people's living standards in the ten years since liberation, the Grand Canal area is not only a base for large-scale saltworks and large amounts of coal, but also a granary, a sea of cotton, and a new "land of fish and rice." All industrial and agricultural products depend on the throughput of the Grand Canal. Therefore, the Grand Canal is dressed in new clothes and has become a water transportation network that extends in all directions, with water transportation between most of China interconnected. In terms of water conservancy construction, it is also a major canal for flood control, drainage, irrigation, power generation, aquaculture development, and河网化（river network development）. Therefore, the Grand Canal project is not only a project that seeks temporary solutions but not fundamental ones, but also requires fundamental transformation and technological innovation, thus becoming a complex project combining indigenous and foreign methods. All cadres, workers, and farmers at the construction site are united, and the people of different regions give play to the spirit of communist cooperation. Today, the masses of the people realize that整治（rectifying） the Grand Canal is a grand undertaking with political and economic significance, a pioneering undertaking that will be remembered for generations, benefit all ages, and be immortal. Therefore, they are full of spirit and high morale, and have launched a high-efficiency movement centered on technological innovation. It is required that through the整治（rectifying） of the Grand Canal, not only can Northern Jiangsu completely get rid of floods and droughts, but also fundamentally change its poor and blank state, so that the poor and backward Northern Jiangsu can catch up with the rich and advanced Southern Jiangsu in a short period of time. The broad masses of the people in Northern Jiangsu unanimously realized that after the Grand Canal is widened and deepened, it can irrigate thousands upon thousands of acres of farmland, drain thousands upon thousands of acres of waterlogged land, prevent major floods that occur once in a thousand years, and use the endless water power to generate electricity, so that the countryside can achieve electrification as soon as possible. We went from Yangzhou to Huaiyin, and looking along the dike, not only was the eastern dike repaired neatly, but even the western dike for防浪（preventing waves） was built from the lake and towered above the lake surface. For thousands of years, the city walls of the counties along the river, which were specially used as the last flood-control fortress for the residents along the river, have also been demolished. It can be seen that the整治（rectifying） of the Grand Canal project is to unfold a great struggle to change the face of nature, end the seven hundred years of water disasters in Northern Jiangsu since the Southern Song Dynasty, eliminate the scourge left over from the reactionary rule, and enable more than 80 million people in the Huai River basin to start building their own socialist "paradise." This is truly a glorious and great miracle of transforming nature that has never been done in history.

The Party's Leadership and the People's Lofty Aspirations are the Fundamental Force for Changing the Face of Nature

The past Northern Jiangsu was a disaster-prone area. According to historical records, there have been 935 water and drought disasters in the Huai River basin in the past 650 years. It is really a major disaster every ten years, a minor disaster every one or two years, and even several disasters in one year. A folk song that has been passed down for many years says: "Fathers盼望（look forward to）, mothers盼望（look forward to）, only盼望（look forward to） that the Huai River will not flood, and one day a great savior will come out to cure the Huai River and make all the people safe." Since Chairman Mao put forward the call to "Be sure to harness the Huai River well," the great savior that the people of the Xuhuai area have been looking forward to for many years has appeared! We visited the great projects such as the Sanhe闸（Sanhe Sluice Gate）, the Erhe闸（Erhe Sluice Gate）, and the Zhangshan闸（Zhangshan Sluice Gate）. The Sanhe闸（Sanhe Sluice Gate） is the project of the Huai River flowing south, the Erhe闸（Erhe Sluice Gate） is the project of diverting the Huai River north, and the Zhangshan闸（Zhangshan Sluice Gate） is the project of controlling the water level of the Luoma Lake reservoir. These projects are all comprehensive utilization projects that combine flood control, drainage, irrigation, power generation, and navigation. Therefore, the Xuhuai area has become a high-standard河网化（river network development）, which is intertwined by干渠（main canals）, 支渠（branch canals）, 斗渠（lateral canals）, 农渠（agricultural canals）, and 毛渠（tertiary canals）, weaving a beautiful river network. Following the "灌溉总渠（General Irrigation Canal）", the "淮沭河（Huaishu River）" which divides the Huai River into Yi River has been newly built, and more than 1,600 medium-sized and small闸坝（sluice dams） have been established, as well as a series of drainage and drought prevention自流灌溉（self-flowing irrigation） projects. Today's Xuhuai area is full of crisscrossing rivers and densely distributed culverts. Past water conservancy projects focused on drainage, while current water conservancy projects focus on water storage; in the past, the Huai River was allowed to flow south, but now the Huai River is allowed to flow north; in the past, people were afraid of water from neighboring provinces entering the territory, but now they welcome water from neighboring provinces entering the territory; in the past, they were afraid of too much water, but now they are afraid of too little water; in the past, people all had a hatred of water, but now people have a love of water. After the completion of these water conservancy projects, the freely泛滥（overflowing） Huai River of the past has been changed into a well-behaved Huai River, teaching it to停则停（stop when it is told to stop）, teaching it to流则流（flow when it is told to flow）, teaching it to聚则聚（gather when it is told to gather）, and teaching it to散则散（disperse when it is told to disperse）. All the water disasters of thousands of years have been turned into water conservancy. It can truly be做到（achieved） "no irrigation guarantee in a year without rain, no waterlogging with 500 millimeters of rain a day, and no danger in a once-in-a-thousand-year flood." These are all great achievements of the people of Northern Jiangsu in overcoming natural disasters and changing the face of nature under the correct leadership of the Party.

It is precisely because the people of Northern Jiangsu have carried out basic farmland water conservancy construction and changed the history of poverty and backwardness for thousands of years, that they have inspired the雄心壮志（lofty aspirations） of the broad masses of the people and put forward the奋斗目标（goal） of "getting rid of poverty in one year, crossing the Huai River in two years, and catching up with Southern Jiangsu in three years." 1960 is the last year for the people of the Xuhuai area to fundamentally change their poor and blank face after three years of hard work. Therefore, after putting forward the雄壮口号（grand slogan） of "Decisive battle in 1960, strive to catch up with Southern Jiangsu", they immediately launched a mass movement of "catching up with Southern Jiangsu and surpassing Southern Jiangsu" in a deep and extensive way. The people of Suzhou in Southern Jiangsu also rose up to应战（meet the challenge） and put forward the 战斗口号（battle cry） of "Hold high the red flag and strive to be at the forefront, Suzhou will go to a higher level," setting off a mass movement of "winning the red flag and vying for the championship" in the whole region. Such a socialist competition of you chasing me, you surpassing me, striving to be at the forefront everywhere, and everyone vying for the championship has become a huge driving force for promoting the countryside of both the north and south of the Yangtze River to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year. The people of Northern Jiangsu said in unison: "People may be poor, but their志气（ambition） is not poor; the poorer they are, the more they want to make revolution; the poorer they are, the more they can make revolution." Therefore, with the heroic spirit of排山倒海（overwhelming the mountains and overturning the seas）, the fearless spirit of despising difficulties, they declared war on poverty and backwardness, and strived to turn Northern Jiangsu into a "paradise" as soon as possible.

Hold High the Red Flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and Completely Get Rid of the Poverty Face of the Xuhuai Area

Why is it that the poverty face of the Xuhuai area, which has not been able to get rid of for thousands of years, can be fundamentally rid of in just a few years? The main reason is that, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, another great social transformation was completed in 1958, enabling the people of Northern Jiangsu, like the people of the whole country, to create the best social organizational form for accelerating socialist construction – the people's commune – under the shining of the general line and inspired by the Great Leap Forward. This great pioneering undertaking has provided extremely favorable conditions for basic rural construction. Especially water conservancy construction has its characteristics: that is, the task is large, the time is short, and the requirements are urgent. Only by concentrating strong human and material resources can it be carried out and completed smoothly. This in-depth visit to the Grand Canal construction site has made me further realize the high superiority of the people's commune, which is more obvious in water conservancy projects. It is precisely because the characteristics of the people's commune are large that it not only increases the strength of individual farmers in the era of the past small-scale peasant economy by a thousand times or more, but also shows greater power compared with the past cooperatives. Cooperatives can only build medium-sized and small water conservancy projects, while communes can carry out large, medium-sized, and small water conservancy projects at the same time; cooperatives can only organize one kind of兵团作战（battle group operation）, while communes can organize multiple兵团（battle groups） to operate at the same time; it can not only undertake the task of huge water conservancy projects, but also arrange the current tasks of various productions, so that all work can advance simultaneously. It is precisely because the characteristic of the people's commune is 公（public）, the land is publicly owned, and there is no distinction between this boundary and that boundary, and the water source is 公用（publicly used）, and there is no worry about顾此失彼（attending to one thing and losing sight of another）, so it can大規模（large-scale）挖渠道（dig channels） and connect the isolated and dispersed projects of the past to form a complete water conservancy system of排灌蓄泄（drainage, irrigation, storage, and discharge）. In the process of the project, the people upstream and downstream, on the left bank and the right bank can cooperate with each other, and the partial interests and the overall interests can be unified, so that everyone can get happiness. For example, the construction of the Luoma Lake reservoir, raising the water level,淹没（submerged） 400,000 mu of farmland, but the increase in自流灌溉（self-flowing irrigation） farmland exceeded 4 million mu. This is truly the best example of "one family moves to 安（safety）, and ten thousand families are happy"! All these advantages are the true凭实据（evidence） of the people's commune being "very good", which has been fully proved from the point of view of water conservancy construction alone. The slanders of the right-wing opportunists that it is "very bad" have already been破（destroyed） in the face of ironclad facts.

After this in-depth visit to the Grand Canal construction site, personally seeing thousands of workers creating great miracles of changing nature with冲天干劲（soaring drive） under the guidance and encouragement of the three red flags; deeply experiencing the revolutionary optimism of the broad masses of the working people and the strong desire to build a socialist "paradise", and comparing the ideological feelings of our bourgeois intellectuals, I truly feel ashamed. Old intellectuals living in the new society, facing new people and new things, are constantly facing the struggle of two positions, two roads, and two worldviews. We feel that the situation is moving, and at the same time we feel that the situation is迫人（pressing）, and we have to transform even if we don't want to. Therefore, we must make the greatest determination to strengthen the fundamental transformation of position and worldview, and never落队（fall behind） in the leaping forward of the wheels of history!

I wish the大会（assembly） a victory and my comrades good health!

    几千年的水害变成了水利
    高一涵委员的发言
    我听了政协副主席陈叔通所作的常务委员会的工作报告，并列席人大，听到了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，这些报告把我国国民经济继续跃进的宏伟壮丽的图画展现在我们面前，使我感到无比兴奋，并表示热烈拥护。
    我个人深感荣幸，于去年12月间参加了江苏省人民委员会大运河工程慰问团，到淮阴专区大运河工地上亲自参加慰问，并就近参观了苏北水利工程，亲眼看到苏北人民群众正在鼓起冲天干劲，在党的领导下，创造了从古未有的改造自然的伟大奇迹。
    过去的运河是：河床淤塞经常泛滥成灾
    众所周知，京杭大运河是我国历史上与长城齐名的一个伟大工程，是世界上最早最大的一条人工河流。两千多年来，它一方面，对历代的政治、经济、军事、交通运输和文化交流起了重大的作用；另一方面，因为它年久失修，河床淤塞，水大则堤溃成灾，洪流泛滥，水小则航运阻止，断绝交通。尤其是洪水为灾时，屡使沿河两岸千百万人民的生命财产受到损害。它给我印象最深的就是1931年运河东堤大决口的惨痛情况。
    我那时正在南京反动政府伪监察院工作，8月26日里运河东堤决口二十六处的消息传来后，伪监察院即派我前往视察调查，追究责任。根据调查材料：淮河水大，涨满了洪泽湖和高宝湖，水位高平堤顶，这是事实。但那时反动政府不仅不设法抢救，反而不顾里下河一带千百万人民的生命财产，黑夜里扒开了归海三坝，妄想降低运河水位。适因西北风急，波浪直冲东堤，顿使自高邮以下河堤决口至二十六处之多。里下河十几县一片汪洋，田庐尽没，单是挡军楼、荷花塘两处决口，就淹死两千多人。我于9月1日从扬州到高邮县城时，亲见沿堤难民露宿堤上，粒米全无，忍饥待赈，等到赈济馒头到时，又糜烂不能入口，但见堤上灾民儿啼女哭，惨不忍闻。这种惨痛情况深印脑中，使我终身不能忘记。
    把这次在大运河工地上看到的情况同那时的情况作今昔对比，就可看出这是根本不同的两个世界。本来，运河造成灾害，有它的自然原因，但主要的还是社会原因。根据历史记载的事实，所谓“天灾”大都是由“人祸”而起。反动统治时代，也在运河各段设立工程机构，并借“导淮”美名，实行横征暴敛。那时反动政府治淮的特点：（一）不求治本，但求治标。从来没有“根治淮河”的打算，只想在运河各工段上安插一批闲人，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，根本没有做过对河床加宽挖深的工作。（二）任用生手，排斥旧人。他们号称采用洋法，把几千年来治水的传统经验一笔勾消，把原来河工人员排斥得一干二净，以致酿成新旧两派尖锐斗争。（三）反动政府官吏处处与人民为敌，一遇到紧急关头，就无法发动人民群众。一当大汛来时，河工人员眼看着千百万人民受苦受难，一走了事。正因为如此，所以在1931年8月26日前夕，所有河工人员眼看着堤防危急，无计可施，只得乘黑夜里偷偷地把全体员工撤回镇江，使几百里长堤无人守护，使沿河一带人民叫天不应，求地无灵。高邮人民至今回忆过去受灾惨痛情况时还这样说：“想起民国二十年运河倒堤决口的日子，我们的心就酸了”。他们所讲的这几句话，也就是我心里所想讲的话。
    现在的运河是：粮仓棉海新的“鱼米之乡”
    这次再到大运河工地上一看，真正是另一个世界。从交通运输方面说，由于解放十年来，工农业生产突飞猛进，人民生活不断提高，大运河一带，既是大型盐场、大量煤炭的基地，又是粮仓棉海，新的“鱼米之乡”。一切工农业产品都有赖于大运河的吞吐，于是大运河穿上新装，成为四通八达的水运网，大半个中国水运由此互通舟楫。从水利建设方面说，它又是防洪、排涝、灌溉、发电、发展水产和河网化的一大干渠。因此，大运河的工程就不是只求治标，不求治本的工程，而是要求从根本上加以改造，从技术上加以革新，因而成为一个土洋结合的复杂工程。工地上所有干部、工人、农民都团结一致，不同地区人民又发挥共产主义大协作的精神。今天的人民群众都认识到整治大运河是一件具有政治意义和经济意义的宏伟事业，是一件流芳百世、造福万代，永垂不朽的创举。因而意气风发，斗志昂扬，开展了以技术革新为中心的高工效运动。要求通过大运河整治工程，不仅能使苏北彻底摆脱洪涝旱灾，并且根本改变一穷二白的面貌，使贫穷落后的苏北，在短期内赶上富裕先进的江南。苏北广大人民群众一致认识到大运河拓宽挖深以后，可以灌溉千千万万亩农田，可以排除千千万万亩内涝，可以防止千年一遇的特大洪水，可以利用源源不绝的水力发电，使农村早日实现电气化。我们从扬州到淮阴，沿堤一望，不独东堤兴修齐整，就连防浪的西堤，也从湖中筑起，耸出湖面。几千年来，沿河居民特为最后防洪堡垒的各县城墙，也都一律拆除了。可见整治大运河工程就是展开伟大的改变自然面貌的斗争，结束了南宋以来七百多年的苏北水灾，消灭了反动统治时期遗留下来的祸害，使得淮河流域八千万以上的人民能够着手来建设自己社会主义的“天堂”。这真是一件在历史上从来没有做过的改造自然的光荣伟大奇迹。
    党的领导，人民群众的雄心壮志是改变自然面貌的根本力量
    过去的苏北是一个多灾多难的地区。根据历史记载：淮河流域在过去六百五十多年间，共发生过水旱灾害九百三十五次。真是十年一大灾，一两年一小灾，甚至一年发生几次灾。多年流传下来的一个民谣说：“爹也盼，娘也盼，只盼淮水不泛滥，有朝出个大救星，治好淮河万民安。”自毛主席提出“一定要把淮河修好”的号召后，徐淮地区人民多年盼望的大救星出现了！我们参观了三河闸、二河闸、嶂
  山闸等伟大工程，三河闸是淮水南流的工程，二河闸是淮水北调的工程，嶂山闸是控制骆马湖水库水位的工程。这些工程都是防洪、排涝与灌溉、发电、航运相结合的综合利用工程。因此，徐淮地区已成为高标准的河网化，由干渠、支渠、斗渠、农渠、毛渠互相交错起来，织成一幅美丽的河网。继“灌溉总渠”之后，又新修了分淮入沂的“淮沭河”，并建立了一千六百多个中小型闸坝，以及一系列的排涝防旱自流灌溉的工程。今天的徐淮地区，到处河道纵横交错，涵洞星罗棋布。过去的水利工程以排水为主，现在的水利工程以蓄水为主；过去是使淮水南下，现在是使淮水北上；过去害怕邻省之水入境，现在欢迎邻省之水入境；过去生怕水多，现在生怕水少；过去人民皆有恨水的心理，现在人民则发生爱水的心理。这些水利工程完成后，把过去自由泛滥的淮水改变为循规蹈矩的淮水，教它渟则渟，教它流则流，教它聚则聚，教它散则散。把几千年来的水害一律变成水利。真正能做到“一年不雨保灌溉，日雨五百毫米不成涝，千年一遇洪水不出险”。这都是苏北人民在党的正确领导下，战胜自然灾害，改变自然面貌的伟大成就。
    正因为苏北人民进行了农田水利的基本建设，改变了几千年来贫穷落后的历史，从而鼓舞起来广大人民群众的雄心壮志，提出了“一年摆脱贫困，二年跨过淮河，三年赶上江南”的奋斗目标。1960年是徐淮地区人民苦干三年基本改变一穷二白面貌的最后一年。因而在提出“决战六零年，奋力赶江南”的雄壮口号后，立即深入广泛地开展了“赶江南，超江南”的群众运动。而江南的苏州地区人民也起来应战，提出“高举红旗争上游，苏州更上一层楼”的战斗口号，在全区范围内掀起“夺红旗，争冠军”的群众运动。像这样的你追我赶、你赶我超、处处争上游、人人夺冠军的社会主义竞赛，已经成为推动大江南北的农村争取今年更好更全面地跃进的一种巨大动力。苏北人民异口同声地说：“人穷志不穷，越穷越想革命，越穷越能革命”，因而以排山倒海的英雄气概，藐视困难的无畏精神，向贫穷落后宣战，争取早日把苏北变成“天堂”。
    高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社红旗，彻底摆脱徐淮地区贫穷面貌
    为什么徐淮地区几千年来不能摆脱的贫穷面貌，在短短的几年内就能够根本摆脱呢？主要原因是由于党的正确领导，在1958年完成了又一次伟大的社会变革，使苏北人民同全国人民一样，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，创造出来加速社会主义建设的最好的社会组织形式——人民公社。这一个伟大的创举，就为农村的基本建设提供了极为有利的条件。尤其是水利建设有它的特点：就是任务大，时间短，要求急，只有集中雄厚的人力物力，才能顺利地进行和完成。这次深入到大运河工地，使我进一步认识了人民公社的高度优越性，它表现在水利工程上更为显著。正因人民公社的特点是大，不仅比过去小农经济时代的个体农民力量增加到千百倍以上，就是与过去的合作社对比，也显示出更大的威力。合作社只能修建中小型水利工程，公社则能够把大中小型水利工程同时并举；合作社只能组织一种兵团作战，公社则能够组织多种兵团同时作战；它既能担负巨大水利工程的任务，又能安排当前各项生产的任务，使一切工作齐头并进。正因为人民公社的特点是公，土地公有，没有此疆彼界之分，水源公用，没有顾此失彼之虑，就可以大规模地开挖渠道，把过去孤立的、分散的工程联系起来，形成一个完整的排灌蓄泄的水利系统。在工程的进行中，既可使上游下游、左岸右岸的人民共同协作，又可把局部利益和整体利益统一起来，使人人得到幸福。例如兴修骆马湖水库，把水位提高，淹没了四十万亩耕地，但增加自流灌溉耕地反而超过四百万亩。这真是“一家迁安，万家幸福”的最好榜样！所有这些优点，都是人民公社“好得很”的真凭实据，单从水利建设这一点上已经充分证明了。右倾机会主义分子所制造的“糟得很”的谰言，在铁一般的事实面前，已经是不攻自破了。
    经过这次深入到大运河的工地，亲眼看到成千上万的劳动人民在三面红旗的指导和鼓舞下，用冲天干劲创造出改变自然的伟大奇迹；深深体会到广大劳动人民的革命乐观主义精神和建设社会主义“天堂”的强烈愿望，和我们资产阶级知识分子的思想感情对比，真正感到惭愧。旧知识分子生活到新社会中，面对着新人新事，就无时无地不面临着两个立场，两条道路，两种世界观的斗争。我们感到形势动人，同时也感到形势逼人，不改造也得要改造。因此，下最大决心，加强立场和世界观的根本改造，绝不在历史车轮飞跃前进中掉队！
    敬祝大会胜利，同志们身体健康！
