Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 7th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a telegram to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, on April 4th regarding the South Vietnamese authorities' promulgation of "Law No. 10 of 1959" and the incidents of retaliation and massacre of former resistance personnel. He once again requested the International Commission to immediately order the South Vietnamese authorities to abolish this fascist law, rescind all verdicts of the Saigon "Special Military Court," and dissolve this court.

　　Vice Minister of National Defense of Vietnam, Ta Quang Buu, announced Vo Nguyen Giap's telegram at a press conference held this morning.

　　The telegram pointed out that the Saigon "Special Military Court," established by the South Vietnamese authorities based on "Law No. 10 of 1959," had already made judgments in twenty death penalty cases and twenty-seven hard labor cases in nine provinces of South Vietnam. In particular, while the International Commission was still considering the cases of Hoang Le Kha and Le Van Phuo, this court actually murdered them.

　　Vo Nguyen Giap said in the telegram that, as he had emphasized to the International Commission, the nature of the South Vietnamese authorities' promulgation of "Law No. 10 of 1959" as a violation of the Geneva Accords is very clear. In the "Policy towards Former Resistance Personnel" published by the South Vietnamese authorities on August 25, 1959, it was already admitted that it divided former resistance personnel into several categories, and blatantly listed most former resistance personnel as so-called "Viet Cong saboteurs," while claiming to "resolutely punish" them.

　　Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities' "Law No. 10 of 1959" and the "Special Military Court" established under this law increasingly expose their nature as tools used by the South Vietnamese authorities to murder South Vietnamese patriots, especially former resistance personnel, in order to implement the intervention and war policies of the US imperialists. This law has become evidence of the accusation against Ngo Dinh Diem's dictatorial regime and the US imperialists' sabotage of peace and unification of Vietnam.

　　The telegram pointed out that at present, the lives of many former resistance personnel sentenced to death by the Saigon "Special Military Court" are in imminent danger, and many former resistance personnel are suffering torture due to being sentenced to hard labor. Many other former resistance personnel and patriotic and peace-loving people in South Vietnam are under the direct threat of the South Vietnamese authorities' "Law No. 10 of 1959." Stopping the bloody hands of the South Vietnamese authorities and American interventionists has become a more urgent demand than ever.

　　Vo Nguyen Giap finally pointed out that in the matter of South Vietnamese authorities' Law No. 10 of 1959, the International Commission bears a significant responsibility in ensuring the strict fulfillment of the Geneva Accords for the peace and unification of Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 6th: Saigon News: The struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the brutal rule of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique has further developed this year.

　　With the US imperialists and their lackey Ngo Dinh Diem clique more frantically expanding their armaments and war preparations, and increasingly intensifying their "sweeps" and persecution of the South Vietnamese people, their fascist truth and panic-stricken mentality have been further exposed. In the "sweeps" in South Vietnam, it is no longer an isolated phenomenon that soldiers are unwilling to kill and plunder the people's property. More and more soldiers are deserting. In some places, incidents have occurred where soldiers killed their commanders to avoid going on "sweeps."

　　The evil deeds of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique have also been opposed by South Vietnamese public opinion. The editorial of "The Road of Life" on February 3rd stated, "It can be said that at the present stage, all Vietnamese people share a common hope, which is peace and a unified country." The South Vietnamese people's opposition to forced relocation and construction of the "Saigon-Bien Hoa Highway" military base, the people of the southwestern and western highlands' opposition to the establishment of "reclamation zones," and the struggles of the people of Quang Ngai, Quang Nam, and other provinces against conscription all demonstrate the South Vietnamese people's desire for peace and a unified country and their firm will.

　　The people in various parts of South Vietnam are also rising in struggles to improve their lives while opposing the expansion of armaments and war preparations and opposing persecution.

　　In the countryside, the struggle against the deprivation of land, forced relocation, concentration, and increased taxes is also developing. For example, tens of thousands of sugarcane farmers in Di An opposed the price suppression policy of the Hiep Hoa sugar factory, and thousands of farmers in Ben Tre, Rach Gia, and other provinces opposed the South Vietnamese authorities' deprivation of their land and demanded compensation.

　　The struggle of South Vietnamese students and intellectuals is also continuing. They demand instruction in Vietnamese and demand reduced tuition and examination fees, etc. South Vietnamese artists are also closely united and powerfully resist the performance of reactionary scripts created by psychological warfare elements in the so-called "literary competition" center. The struggle goal of the national bourgeoisie is to oppose "US aid"; industrialists and businessmen oppose "uniform taxation."

　　Faced with the increasingly powerful struggle movement of the South Vietnamese people, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique feels increasingly isolated. The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem newspaper "Commentary" had to admit that "Our weakness lies in the fact that the people do not cooperate with the army," and "the people are prejudiced against the regime."

### 制止吴庭艳集团和美国干涉者的血手  武元甲要求越南国际委员会责成南越当局停止迫害前抗战人员  南越人民反对美吴集团残暴统治的斗争日益扩大

    制止吴庭艳集团和美国干涉者的血手
    武元甲要求越南国际委员会责成南越当局停止迫害前抗战人员
    南越人民反对美吴集团残暴统治的斗争日益扩大
    据新华社河内7日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲大将4月4日就南越当局颁布的“59年第十号”法令和报复、残杀前抗战人员的事件打电报给越南国际委员会主席安萨里，再一次要求国际委员会立即责成南越当局取消这项法西斯法令和撤消西贡“特别军事法庭”的一切判决，并且解散这个法庭。
    越南国防部副部长谢光宝在今天上午举行的记者招待会上公布了武元甲的这封电报。
    电报指出，南越当局根据“59年第十号”法令建立的西贡“特别军事法庭”，已经在南越九个省流动判决了二十起死刑案件和二十七起苦役案件；特别是当国际委员会还在考虑黄励柯和黎文漂的案件的时候，这个法庭竟然把他们杀害了。
    武元甲在电报里说，正如他曾经向国际委员会强调指出的，南越当局颁布的“59年第十号”法令的违反日内瓦协议的性质是十分明显的。南越当局在1959年8月25日公布的“对前抗战人员的政策”中已经承认，它把前抗战人员分成几类，明目张胆地把大多数前抗战人员都列入所谓“越共破坏分子”一类，同时声称要“坚决惩治”。
    武元甲强调指出，南越当局的“59年第十号”法令和根据这个法令建立的“特别军事法庭”，越来越暴露它们是南越当局用来杀害南越爱国者、首先是前抗战人员，以实现美帝国主义者的干涉和战争政策的工具的性质。这个法令已经成为控诉吴庭艳的独裁制度和美帝国主义者破坏越南的和平和统一的罪证。
    电报指出，目前，被西贡“特别军事法庭”判处死刑的许多前抗战人员的生命危在旦夕，许多前抗战人员由于被判处苦役，正在遭受痛苦的折磨。南越许多其他前抗战人员和爱国爱和平的人民正在受到南越当局“59年第十号”法令的直接威胁。制止南越当局和美国干涉者的血手已经成为比任何时候更加迫切的要求。
    武元甲最后指出，在关于南越当局1959年第十号法令的问题上，国际委员会在保证为了越南的和平和统一而严正履行日内瓦协议的任务中负有重大的责任。
    据新华社河内6日电　西贡消息：南越人民反对美国—吴庭艳集团残暴统治的斗争今年以来有了进一步的发展。
    随着美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团更加疯狂的扩军备战和日益变本加厉的“扫荡”和对南越人民的迫害，它们的法西斯真相和惊惶失措的心理也进一步暴露了出来。在南越的“扫荡”中，士兵不愿残杀和抢劫人民财产已不是个别现象，开小差的士兵越来越多，有的地方还发生了士兵杀死指挥官免得去“扫荡”的事情。
    美国—吴庭艳集团的恶行也遭到南越舆论的反对。“生活之路”2月3日的社论说，“可以说，在目前的阶段，所有的越南人都怀着共同的希望，就是和平和统一国家。”南越人民反对迫迁和建设“西贡边和公路”军事基地，南部西面和西原人民反对成立“垦荒区”，广义、广南等省人民反对拉夫抓兵的斗争都证明了南越人民要求和平统一国家的愿望和坚决的意志。
    南越各地人民在反对扩军备战、反对迫害的同时要求改善生活的斗争也在高涨。
    在农村，反对剥夺土地、迫迁、集中和增税的斗争也在发展。例如堤岸成万的蔗农反对协和糖厂的压价政策，梹椥、迪石等省的成千农民反对南越当局剥夺他们的土地，要求赔偿。
    南越学生和知识分子的斗争也在继续，他们要求用越语授课；要求减少学费和考试费等。南越艺人也紧紧地团结在一起，有力地抵制演出所谓“文学比赛”中心理战分子创作的反动剧本。民族资产阶级斗争目标是反对“美援”；工商业者反对“平均课税”。
    面对南越人民越来越强大的斗争运动，吴庭艳集团日益感到孤立。南越吴庭艳的报纸“言论报”不得不承认，“我们的弱点在于民众没有同军队合作”，“民众对政权抱成见”。
