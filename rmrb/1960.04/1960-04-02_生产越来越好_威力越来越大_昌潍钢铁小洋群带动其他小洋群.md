Production Getting Better and Better, Power Getting Greater and Greater
Changwei Iron and Steel Small-Scale Group Drives Other Small-Scale Groups
    The entire district's iron and steel enterprises have basically achieved mechanization. A number of blast furnaces are producing high yields and high quality, completing the first quarter's plan ahead of schedule. Industry, capital construction, transportation, and handicrafts are making an all-round leap forward; many products are now able to be produced.
    (Our newspaper's) Weifang, 1st – The iron and steel small-scale groups in the Changwei Special District of Shandong Province have demonstrated tremendous power. Since last year, production has been steadily increasing, and since the beginning of 1960, it has reached a new level. The eighty-five 3 to 55 cubic meter blast furnaces in the district that are in regular production have maintained an average utilization coefficient of around 2, with a pig iron qualification rate of 88% to over 90%, a coke ratio of 0.96, and a unit cost reduced by 35% compared to the average of last year. This represents a large-scale harvest of high yield, high quality, and low cost, and the district has overfulfilled the first quarter's national pig iron production plan by 27 days. The rapid development of the iron and steel industry in this special district has also driven an all-round leap forward in other industries, as well as in capital construction, transportation, handicrafts, and other sectors.
    The iron and steel industry in Changwei Special District started from scratch in 1958. After the rectification, consolidation, and improvement in the first half of 1959, it basically completed the transition from small-scale native groups to small-scale modern groups. This has led to continuous improvement and enhancement of technical equipment and technical operations, with a gradual increase in production levels. At the beginning of last year, very few blast furnaces in the district could reach a utilization coefficient of 1, but by June and July, a utilization coefficient of 1 was no longer considered advanced, and many blast furnaces had reached a target of 1.5. The pig iron qualification rate also increased from around 50% to around 70%. In October of last year, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on popularizing the advanced experience of the small blast furnaces in the smelting workshop of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory. The Changwei Prefectural Committee and relevant industrial leading organs immediately and resolutely implemented these instructions. Through effective measures, in just a few months, the iron and steel small-scale groups in the entire district have entered a new stage of rapid development, and iron and steel production has achieved an unprecedented and substantial increase.
    The iron and steel industry in Changwei Special District has vigorously carried out technological transformation through mass technological innovation. Currently, the furnace bodies of the small blast furnaces throughout the district have generally been thickened and shortened. The air supply systems have all been rebuilt with horizontal hot blast stoves, and the hot air pipes have been thickened and the air inlets enlarged. The gas downcomers have also been thickened, and water-air filtration dust collectors have been added. In terms of blowing, larger blowers or multiple machines in parallel have been adopted to achieve strong wind and high-temperature operation, increasing the smelting intensity. At the same time, in the spirit of self-reliance, a large number of machines and equipment combining native and modern methods have been manufactured, such as crushers, small magnetic separators, electric screening machines, ore ball presses, and automatic drying machines, as well as light rail wooden dump trucks and winches. At present, iron and steel enterprises in the entire district have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, changing the past situation of basically manual operation. This has increased production efficiency (calculated by different types of work) by 2 to 10 times, while also reducing labor intensity and saving labor.
    With the deepening of the technological innovation movement, the various iron and steel enterprises have also correspondingly strengthened their management work, putting some successful experiences together into a "complete set." For example, in terms of sintering ore, the "six-character" operating regulations of fine, accurate, uniform, diligent, alkaline, and selective were summarized and promoted. For furnace charge processing, the "four-character" experience of dry, clean, small, and separate was implemented. In terms of mechanical maintenance, various systems were also stipulated. This has ensured the normal production of the blast furnaces.
    The vigorous development of the iron and steel industry in Changwei Special District is inseparable from the strong support of other departments. For a long time, mechanical factories, electrical machinery factories, repair factories, and foundries have generally been linked to iron and steel factories, striving to manufacture or process the machinery and equipment needed by the iron and steel factories. The construction departments have also provided strong support. In Weifang City alone, nearly half of the construction workers are regularly involved in the capital construction projects of blast furnaces and other equipment. The transportation departments also prioritize the transportation of materials needed for iron and steel production. If the iron and steel factories lack any raw materials, the local Party committee immediately convenes coordination meetings of relevant factories to mobilize the factories to help solve the problems.
    The development of the iron and steel industry has driven an all-round leap forward in various sectors. Before the large-scale iron and steel production in Changwei Special District, many products that could not be produced, such as generators, transformers, blowers, various small electrical switches, and electric wires, can now be produced. Foundries that previously could only produce some small parts can now use pig iron to replace steel plates to cast the shells of hot blast stoves. The annual coal production capacity of the entire district has increased sharply from 360,000 tons before the large-scale iron and steel production to more than 2 million tons. The capacity of power generation equipment has increased by two times. At present, every county has a cement factory and a refractory material factory. Oxygen, which could not be produced in the past, can now also be produced. The capital construction industry has not only continuously expanded its technical teams, but also rapidly improved the technical operating skills of its workers. The same has promoted the transportation industry. For example, in automobile transportation, the monthly output per ton of vehicles in the entire district has jumped from 2,000 to 3,000 ton-kilometers in the past to 12,000 to 13,000 ton-kilometers. Some of the original handicraft societies and cooperative groups have also changed greatly. For example, the cooperative groups that used to repair rubber shoes and carriage tires have now developed into rubber cooperative factories, which can produce rubber hoses, conveyor belts, V-belts, etc., needed by iron and steel factories. In the red furnace handicraft societies, the hand hammers commonly used in the past have long been replaced by electric hammers, spring hammers, etc., transforming into mechanized and semi-mechanized production. Before the large-scale iron and steel production, a factory with more than 100 people in the entire district was considered a large factory. Now, factories with around 100 people are small factories, and there are very few of them.
    The rapid development of the iron and steel industry in Changwei Special District has also created favorable conditions for the entire industry to support agriculture. For example, the pig iron allocated for the manufacture of agricultural production materials in the entire district has been continuously increasing, enabling mechanical factories to manufacture more and more agricultural machinery and tools for rural areas. For example, the output of water pumps for agricultural use in the entire district in 1959 increased by more than two times compared to 1958.

    生产越来越好  威力越来越大
    昌潍钢铁小洋群带动其他小洋群
  　全区钢铁企业基本实现机械化，一批高炉高产优质，提前完成首季计划工业、基本建设、交通运输和手工业全面跃进；许多产品开始能够生产
    本报潍坊1日电　山东省昌潍专区钢铁小洋群发挥了巨大的威力。自去年以来，生产步步登高，进入1960年以来更上一层楼，全区经常生产的八十五座三至五十五立方米高炉，平均利用系数经常稳定在二左右，生铁合格率达到88％，以至90％以上，焦比为零点九六，单位成本比去年平均降低35％，获得了高产、优质、低成本的大面积丰收，并已提前二十七天超额完成了首季国家产铁计划。由于这个专区的钢铁工业飞速发展，还带动了其他工业以及基本建设、交通运输、手工业等各行各业的全面跃进。
    昌潍专区的钢铁工业，在1958年白手起家，从无到有的基础上，经过1959年上半年的整顿、巩固、提高，基本上完成了从小土群向小洋群过渡的发展阶段，从而使技术装备、技术操作不断改善和提高，生产水平逐步上升。去年年初，全区高炉利用系数能达到一的很少，而到6、7月间，利用系数为一的已不是先进水平了，不少高炉已达到一点五的指标，生铁合格率也由50％左右提高到70％左右。去年10月间，中共山东省委发出关于推广济南印染厂冶炼车间小高炉先进经验的指示，昌潍地委以及有关工业领导机关，立即坚决贯彻执行，并通过采取有效措施，经过短短几个月的时间，使全区钢铁小洋群跨上了一个突飞猛进的崭新阶段，钢铁生产获得了空前未有的大幅度的提高。
    昌潍专区钢铁工业通过群众性的技术革新大力进行了技术改造。目前，全专区小高炉的炉身普遍加粗改矮；送风系统都改建了卧式热风炉，还加粗了热风管道和加大了进风口；煤气下降管也加粗，并增设水风过滤除尘器。鼓风方面采用了较大鼓风机或多机并联，实现了强风高温操作，提高了冶炼强度。同时，他们本着自力更生的精神，制造了大量土洋结合的粉碎机、小磁选机、电动筛料机、压矿球机、自动烘干机等机械设备，以及轻便轨道木斗车和卷扬机等。目前，全区钢铁企业已经基本实现机械化和半机械化，改变了过去基本上手工操作的状况，从而使生产效率（以不同工种计算）提高二至十倍，而且还减轻了劳动强度，节余了劳动力。
    随着技术革新运动的深入开展，各钢铁企业又相应地加强了管理工作，把一些成功的经验“配套成龙”。如烧结矿石，总结推广了细、准、匀、勤、碱、选的“六字”操作规程；炉料处理，推行了干、净、小、分的“四字”经验；机械维修方面，也规定了各项制度。这样就保证了高炉正常生产。
    昌潍专区钢铁工业的蓬勃发展，是和其他部门的大力支援分不开的。长期以来，机械厂、电机厂、修配厂、铸造厂等单位，一般都与钢铁厂挂钩，努力制造或加工钢铁厂需用的机械设备。建筑部门也大力支援，仅潍坊市，即有将近一半的建筑工人，经常投入高炉等设备的基建工程。交通部门也优先运送钢铁生产所需的物资。如果钢铁厂缺少什么原材料，当地党委即召开有关工厂的协作会议，动员各厂帮助解决。
    钢铁工业发展了，又带动了各行各业全面跃进。昌潍专区在大办钢铁以前，许多不能生产的产品，如发电机、变压器、鼓风机、各种小型电器开关和电线等，目前都能生产了。过去只能生产一些小型配件的铸造厂，现在能用生铁代替钢板铸造热风炉的炉壳。全区煤炭的年产能力已由大办钢铁前的三十六万吨猛增到二百多万吨。发电设备容量增加两倍。目前，县县都已有水泥厂、耐火材料厂。历来不能生产的氧气也能生产了。基本建设业不仅技术队伍不断扩大，而且工人的技术操作水平也迅速提高。同样也促进了交通运输业，如汽车运输，全区过去车吨月产只二三千吨公里，目前已跃增到一万二千到一万三千吨公里。原来的一些手工业社和合作组，如今也大大变样。如过去修补胶鞋、马车轮胎的合作组，现已发展为橡胶合作工厂，能生产钢铁厂等需用的胶管、传送带、三角带等。那些红炉手工业社，过去常用的手锤，早已被电锤、弹簧锤等所代替，变成机械化和半机械化生产。大办钢铁前，全区百人以上的工厂就算大厂。现在，百人左右的工厂已是小厂，而且为数很少。
    昌潍专区钢铁工业的飞速发展，也为整个工业支援农业创造了良好条件。如全区拨给制造农业生产资料需用的生铁，由于不断增加，使机械工厂为农村制造出越来越多的农械、农具。如农业用的水泵，全区1959年的产量即比1958年增长了二倍多。
