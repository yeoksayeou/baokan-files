Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, April 21st: (Our Correspondent Qian Xing) Seven hundred women representatives, representing millions upon millions of women around the world, gathered in Copenhagen today to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of International Women's Day.

Fifty years ago, approximately one hundred women from sixteen countries gathered in Copenhagen to declare the need for women to unite in order to fight for their basic rights and to make every effort to strive for peace. In 1910, the decision to celebrate International Women's Day annually was made in Copenhagen.

Now, gathered in this hall are leading figures from the women's movements of approximately ninety countries. Among them are people from all walks of life, including government ministers, members of parliament, scientists, artists, workers in various industries, and housewives. They have come here to review the achievements of the women's movement over the past fifty years and to discuss future issues.

The conference hall is beautifully decorated. Banners and flags hang around the hall, bearing the theme of the conference in seven languages: "The Status of Women Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow." Colorful gifts from delegations from various countries hang on the walls.

At the opening of the conference, Mrs. Gerda Heikel, a dramatic actress from the Royal Academy of Stockholm, recited an introductory poem. Then, an orchestra conducted by Mrs. Kolbel, a famous Danish musician, played music by Scandinavian composers. Mrs. Anna Westergaard, a leader of the Danish women's movement and head of Danish State Railways Traffic, delivered a welcoming speech.

The Presidium of the Congress, consisting of more than thirty people, took their seats on the stage amidst warm applause. Among them were: Mrs. Anna Westergaard (Denmark), Mrs. Eugénie Cotton (France), Palma Guillén de Nicolau (Mexico), Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru (India), Nina Popova (Soviet Union), Li Dequan (China), Lilli Becher (German Democratic Republic), Alicja Musialowa (Poland), Echeverría Acosta (Cuba).

The President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Mrs. Eugénie Cotton of France, delivered a speech on the role and responsibility of women in ridding the world of war, hunger, and ignorance.

She spoke of the danger of nuclear war and opposed those who profit from the manufacture of weapons and those who claim that eliminating the arms industry would cause an economic crisis. She stated that if the energy devoted to preparing for war and manufacturing nuclear weapons were turned to working for peace, there would be new possibilities for enriching people's lives.

In her speech, Mrs. Cotton opposed the racial discrimination and discrimination against women that still exist in many places, especially in places where white and black people live together. She praised the great achievements of Soviet women in education, medicine, and scientific research, and how ordinary farmers and workers have been trained to become engineers and participate in great inventions.

She emphasized that China's achievements in all fields over the past decade have shaken the world. She said that China's achievements in eliminating illiteracy are the most amazing.

She said that hunger is still widespread in many parts of the world. She said that we can no longer tolerate the situation as in the past, that while millions are starving, some people burn wheat or throw it into the sea in order to keep market prices from falling.

She finally emphasized the need to strengthen the solidarity of women around the world. She said that this solidarity will help solve various problems in different countries, and internationally, it will help eliminate hunger, disease, ignorance, and war.

In the afternoon session, six reports were presented on: the issue of women's participation in economic life, the issue of women's civil rights, the issue of women's participation in public life, the issue of social achievements enabling women to reconcile their activities outside their families with their family responsibilities, the issue of women's education and cultural development, and the tasks of women's organizations and all women in promoting the easing of international tensions, disarmament, and cooperation among the peoples of all countries.

Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, these issues will be discussed in six groups.

    加强妇女团结  争取世界和平
    国际妇女大会在哥本哈根开幕
    新华社哥本哈根21日电　本社记者钱行报道：代表世界上千千万万妇女的七百名妇女代表今天在哥本哈根集会纪念国际妇女节五十周年。
    五十年前，来自十六个国家的大约一百名妇女在哥本哈根集会，宣布妇女有必要团结起来以争取她们的基本权利和进行一切努力来争取和平。1910年在哥本哈根作出了每年庆祝国际妇女节的决定。
    现在在这个大厅里聚会的是来自大约九十个国家的妇女运动中的主要人物。她们之中有各阶层的人，包括政府部长、议会议员、科学家、艺术家、各行业的工人和家庭妇女。她们到这里来是要回顾五十年来妇女运动的成就，并且讨论将来的问题。
    会议厅装饰得非常漂亮。会议厅的四周悬挂着横幅旗帜，上面用七种文字写着大会的主题：“昨天，今天和明天的妇女的地位”。在墙上悬挂了各国代表团送给大会的五彩缤纷的礼品。
    在大会开幕时，斯德哥尔摩皇家学院的戏剧演员格蕾尔德·海恩夫人朗诵了一篇序诗。然后由丹麦著名音乐家科耳贝夫人指挥的乐队演奏了斯堪的纳维亚作曲家的乐曲。丹麦妇女运动领袖、丹麦国营铁路交通负责人安娜·维斯特戈尔夫人致欢迎词。
    由三十多人组成的大会主席团在热烈的掌声中在主席台上就座，她们中间有：安娜·维斯特戈尔夫人（丹麦）、欧仁尼·戈登夫人（法国）、帕耳马·纪廉·德尼古劳（墨西哥）、拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人（印度）、尼娜·波波娃（苏联）、李德全（中国）、莉莉·贝切尔（德意志民主共和国）、阿丽齐雅·穆霞沃达（波兰）埃切维里亚·阿科斯达（古巴）。
    国际民主妇女联合会主席，法国的欧仁妮·戈登夫人发表了一篇演说，谈到妇女在使世界摆脱战争、饥饿和愚昧方面的作用和责任。
    她谈到核战争的危险，并且反对那些从制造武器中获利的人和那些声称消灭军火工业将会造成经济危机的人。她表示，如果把备战和制造核武器的精力转而为和平而努力，那么，就有丰富人民生活的新的可能。
    戈登夫人在讲话中反对在许多地方还存在的种族歧视和歧视妇女的现象，特别是在那些白人和黑人共居的地方。她赞扬苏联妇女在教育、医学和科学研究方面的巨大成就，以及普通农民和工人怎样被培养成为工程师和参加伟大的发明工作。
    她强调说，中国在过去十年中的各方面成就震动了世界。她说，中国在消灭文盲方面的成就是最惊人的。
    她说，在世界许多地方，饥饿仍然普遍存在。她说，现在我们不再能像过去那样容忍这种情况，那就是，在几百万人挨饿的时候，有人却为了保持市场价格不下跌，把小麦烧掉或扔在大海中。
    她最后强调有必要加强全世界妇女的团结。她说，这种团结将有助于解决不同国家的各种问题，在国际上，将有助于消灭饥饿、疾病、愚昧和战争。
    在下午的会议上，发表了六篇报告，这些报告是：妇女参加经济生活的问题，妇女的公民权问题，妇女参加公共生活的问题，社会成就使妇女有可能把她们的家庭以外的活动同她们的家庭责任相一致的问题，妇女的教育和文化发展问题，妇女组织和全体妇女促进缓和国际紧张局势、裁军和各国人民合作的任务问题。
    明天和后天将分成六组来讨论这些问题。
