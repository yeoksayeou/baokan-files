Comrades Chairman, Deputies, and Committee Members:

I fully agree with the three reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin.

Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture is an urgent requirement at the current stage of socialist construction in our country, and it is also a major issue of concern to all the deputies. Now, I would like to express some opinions on this issue.

In Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, he gave a very good explanation of the necessity of accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture in our country and the guiding principles for achieving it. I don't intend to repeat it.

With the victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country, the Party and the state, while undertaking the great cause of national industrialization, have also begun to gradually solve the problem of the technical transformation of agriculture. In recent years, the mechanization of agriculture in our country has been progressing gradually. By the end of 1959, there were 59,000 standard units of tractors and 4,900 combine harvesters in rural areas across the country. About 5% of the cultivated land has been mechanically cultivated. The power of irrigation and drainage machinery is 3.38 million horsepower, and the area of mechanical irrigation and drainage accounts for about 20% of the cultivated land that needs mechanical irrigation and drainage. Rural power stations have developed to 200,000 kilowatts. In terms of water conservancy construction and rural transportation, some mechanized and semi-mechanized measures have also been taken. Agricultural vehicles and rubber-wheeled vehicles are gradually increasing. The construction of agricultural machinery industry has also achieved considerable development. We have built the Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory with world-advanced technology and some other factories. The annual output of agricultural machinery products has reached a considerable scale. Of course, these achievements are only the beginning for our country to achieve the great goal of agricultural modernization.

        Agricultural Machinery Industry is in a
        New Situation of Great Leap Forward

The victory of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the realization of the people's communes have created the necessary prerequisites for the technical transformation of agriculture and brought about the urgent need for the technical transformation of agriculture. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong timely put forward the instruction to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, striving to basically realize agricultural mechanization in about ten years, and stipulated the implementation steps of solving it in a small way in four years, solving it in a medium way in seven years, and solving it in a big way in ten years from 1959. According to this instruction, the State Council decided to establish the agricultural machinery industry department in August last year, and at the same time, emphasized the call for industry to support agriculture and adopted a series of positive measures. In 1960, the state allocated 1.1 million tons of steel for agricultural machinery industry, an increase of about 100% over 1959. There has also been a substantial increase in capital construction investment. It can be said that the agricultural machinery industry is currently in a new situation of a great leap forward. According to the national plan, the production of mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural implements in 1960 will increase substantially compared with 1959: 22,000 standard units of tractors, an increase of 293%; 2,000 combine harvesters, an increase of 60%; 2.5 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, an increase of 40%; 8,410 units of livestock machinery, an increase of 230%; 200,000 to 300,000 kilowatts of rural small power stations, an increase of 300% to 500%; 23.85 million units of semi-mechanized agricultural implements and transportation tools, an increase of 400%. After completing the above plan, by the end of this year, agriculture will have 81,000 standard units of tractors, 6,900 combine harvesters, 5.88 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, and 450,000 kilowatts of rural small power stations. The area of mechanized cultivation will reach 11.2 million mu, accounting for about 6.9% of the country's cultivated land area, and the area of mechanical irrigation and drainage will reach 26.5 million mu, accounting for about 38% of the country's cultivated land area that needs mechanical irrigation and drainage. After completing the above plan, the newly added agricultural mechanized products in rural areas in 1960, converted into mechanical power, are equivalent to about 5 million horsepower. Calculated on the basis of one horsepower being equivalent to four laborers, it is equivalent to an increase of 20 million laborers. The newly added large number of semi-mechanized products is equivalent to an increase of more than 10 million laborers. The sum of these two items is equivalent to an increase of about 30 million or more laborers for rural areas, equivalent to about 14% of the existing labor force in rural areas. As everyone knows, if 30 million laborers are fully utilized, what a huge amount of wealth it will create for our socialist construction.

Under the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, a upsurge of industry supporting agriculture is now sweeping across all regions and departments of the country, all the way down to the People's Liberation Army. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement for the improvement of agricultural implements and tools in the agricultural machinery industry enterprise system and the vast rural areas is also surging forward continuously. These are two torrents that promote and influence each other in the agricultural technical revolution movement. Many regions are making these two torrents increasingly closely combined under the new form of "factory (factory) commune (commune) linking". This is the new situation of the leap forward in the technical transformation of agriculture. This excellent situation not only shows us the bright prospect of accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture, but also provides us with the correct way to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization in our country.

Below, I would like to talk about some preliminary experiences on how to realize agricultural mechanization in our country.

      The Fundamental Problem of
        Agricultural Mechanization is to Vigorously Launch Mass Movements

The basic requirements for realizing agricultural mechanization in our country are, on the one hand, to resolutely follow the spirit of the Party's general line, achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, and gradually meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in agricultural production and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery production for technical equipment, so that the development of agriculture can adapt to the development of industry. This is an extremely important condition for ensuring the sustained leap forward of socialist construction. On the other hand, we must base ourselves on the characteristics of our country, adapt to the comprehensive needs of the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" and a whole set of intensive farming systems, and on the basis of effectively improving agricultural labor productivity, continuously increase the yield per unit area of crops, so that the growing needs of industrial raw materials and people's lives for agricultural products can be guaranteed. This is a very arduous and very complex task, and we have the confidence and every possibility to gradually complete this task.

How to achieve the above-mentioned task? We believe that the fundamental key lies in resolutely implementing the general line of socialist construction and a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, and the key lies in vigorously launching mass movements. And vigorously launching mass movements is the basis for thoroughly implementing the general line and the policy of walking on two legs. Therefore, the fundamental problem of realizing agricultural mechanization is first of all how to vigorously launch mass movements.

There are two aspects to the mass movement on the agricultural mechanization front. One aspect is the mass movement of more than 500 million peasants to improve agricultural implements and tools. This movement has gained extremely wide development after many years, especially since the Great Leap Forward and the communization of the people, and is now continuously moving towards serialization and semi-mechanization. This is the foundation for realizing agricultural mechanization in our country. The other aspect is the mass movement within agricultural machinery industrial enterprises and scientific and technological research departments. This aspect of the movement has also achieved many successes, and new creations in production technology, product design, raw material conservation, capital construction, and enterprise management systems are constantly emerging. This is the technical innovation and technical revolution movement that is currently flourishing on the agricultural machinery industry front. These two aspects of the movement are now increasingly combined and promote each other under the call of industry supporting agriculture and under the form of "factory-commune linkage". This form of factory-commune linkage is that the general factories, mining enterprises, especially agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair enterprises of the state, respectively establish technical cooperation agreements with one or several communes in the nearby area, and implement mutual cooperation, mutual support, and mutual learning. Factories implement technology to the countryside, such as providing teaching and repair for the use of machines. This form is conducive to the development of the combination of industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and is also conducive to the development and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance at the present stage. The workers and suburban peasants of Shanghai have issued such a hymn to the combination of these two major movements: "The worker-peasant alliance has great power, the technical revolution is blooming red flowers, workers and peasants work together, break through the big and small keys, it is difficult for one factory and one commune to solve, the whole area and the whole county are contracted to fight, no matter how difficult it is, victory must belong to everyone". Further comprehensive planning, strengthening leadership, and continuously developing these two aspects of the mass movement, and making them better combined and continuously improved on the basis of the semi-mechanization movement of improving agricultural implements and tools in the vast rural areas, will surely more forcefully promote the technical revolution of agriculture, and will greatly accelerate the smooth realization of the task of agricultural mechanization in our country. It should be pointed out that in order to smoothly accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, we must attach great importance to the agricultural implement improvement movement in rural areas. It is very clear that if we leave the foundation of the semi-mechanization movement of improving agricultural implements by more than 500 million peasants, it is impossible to solve any major problems in agricultural mechanization. First, let's take the design of agricultural machinery products as an example. For example, the rice transplanter, which has not been solved for a long time in the world, and which we have now basically finalized, was created in the mass movement of improving agricultural implements. Among them, some excellent models, such as the Liling No. transplanter, which was very popular in the recent performance in Burma, was created and invented by Comrade He Jisheng, a peasant. The same is true from the perspective of technological transformation of agricultural machinery industrial enterprises. The agricultural implement manufacturing and repair plants owned by the people's communes now mostly grew and developed from the soil to the foreign in the mass movement of improving agricultural implements. The first machinery factory in Dezhou, Shandong, is such a machinery factory that has developed from an open-air horseshoe nailing cooperative group to a machinery factory with 600 workers and dozens of foreign machines. This is a very touching example, and there are many more examples like this that can be cited.

      Agricultural Mechanization Must Proceed from
        the Actual Needs of Our Country

It is necessary to criticize the idea that agricultural mechanization can ignore the natural conditions and the fine traditions of intensive farming in our country, and simply copy the existing products and existing experiences of foreign countries. Of course, it is important to learn and refer to the advanced experiences of foreign countries according to the specific conditions of our country. However, it is more important to continuously design and create agricultural machinery that is suitable for the conditions of our country based on the creations of the masses, proceeding from the actual needs of agricultural production, from the diverse needs of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, from the actual needs of farmland water conservancy construction, transportation, rural construction, and rural industries, that is, garden-style, intensive farming, combined large, medium, and small, precise in structure, adapted to local conditions, and capable of comprehensive utilization. In order to solve this task, it is of course necessary to vigorously develop scientific and technological research and experimentation work, and to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of agricultural machinery scientific and technical personnel. However, this kind of scientific research work, if it leaves the mass movement of more than 500 million peasants to improve agricultural implements and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in factories and enterprises, if it only relies on some scientific research institutions to study behind closed doors, then it is certainly impossible to have any major achievements.

Another view that must also be criticized is that agricultural mechanization only requires the state to come up with a large number of agricultural machines, and there is no need to rely on the vast number of peasants, nor on the people's communes, let alone continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the peasants and continuously consolidate the people's communes. They do not understand that the realization of agricultural mechanization should be combined with the continuous improvement of the superstructure and relations of production in rural areas, should be combined with the consolidation of the people's communes and the development of the commune economy, and should gradually realize the industrialization of the communes, and should combine the support of the state with the strength of the communes themselves. It should be pointed out that the agricultural mechanization movement is the personal cause of all the people, especially more than 500 million peasants. It must be a broad and profound mass movement. Without the mass movement, without the consolidation of the people's communes and the development of the commune economy and commune industry, it is impossible to truly accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization.

There is another view that also needs to be criticized. That is the idea that agricultural mechanization can be completely dependent on modern equipment and modern agricultural machinery at once. They deny the dialectical process of the development of the movement, do not recognize the necessity of semi-mechanization, do not recognize the important role of indigenous methods, do not see that indigenous methods can lead to foreign methods, do not understand that improved farm implements are the mother of modern agricultural machinery, and therefore, they actually negate the policy of walking on two legs. It should be affirmed that from semi-mechanization to mechanization is precisely the necessary process for realizing agricultural mechanization, and it is also the development process of a mass movement such as the technical transformation of agriculture. Only the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods, the policy of walking on two legs combining mechanization and semi-mechanization, is the only correct policy for accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization. Especially in the recent years, we must adhere to semi-mechanization and improved farm implements as the main focus. Only by thoroughly criticizing the above-mentioned various incorrect opinions and erroneous ideas can the mass movement on the front of agricultural mechanization be better and more sustained. Only by doing a good job in the mass movement can we truly accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization.

Comrades Deputies: The magnificent and arduous project of accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture in our country has begun to advance in a big way. The new era of "no need for cows to plow the fields, no need for oil to light the lamps, and no need to worry about droughts and floods", which has been longed for by the vast number of peasants in our country for a long time, is gradually approaching us. This marks the beginning of a new period of fundamentally changing the economic face of our country. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that "China can only completely transform its socio-economic system in terms of socialist transformation, and use machines in all departments and places where machines can be used to operate, in order to completely change the socio-economic face." Because the technical transformation of agriculture will be accelerated, the continued leap forward of agriculture in our country and the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program will be better guaranteed; the people's communes and the worker-peasant alliance will also be further consolidated and developed on a new basis; the people's lives will also be gradually improved; socialist construction will also achieve a better and more comprehensive sustained leap forward. We firmly believe that under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, holding high the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible and invincible, relying on the efforts of the vast number of workers and more than 500 million peasants, and continuously overcoming difficulties, we will be able to gradually accelerate the great task of realizing the technical transformation of agriculture.

The agricultural machinery department was established not long ago. The organization is incomplete, the situation is not familiar, the experience is lacking, the task is urgent, and there are many shortcomings in the work. Please help us find problems and make criticisms.

Please correct any inappropriate remarks in the above speech.

    加速实现农业技术改造
    农业机械工业部部长陈正人在人大二次会议上的发言
    主席、各位代表，各位委员：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的三个报告。
    加速农业的技术改造，是我国社会主义建设现阶段的迫切要求，也是各位代表关心的一个重大问题。现在我就这个问题，发表一点意见。
    李富春副总理的报告中，对于加速我国农业技术改造的必要性和实现农业技术改造的方针，作了很好的阐述，我不拟再来重复。
    随着我国农业社会主义改造的胜利，党和国家在实现国家工业化这一伟大事业的同时，已经开始着手逐步解决农业的技术改造问题。几年来，我国农业机械化工作在逐步进展。到1959年为止，全国农村已有拖拉机五万九千个标准台、联合收割机四千九百台。约有5％的耕地实现了机械耕种，排灌机械动力三百三十八万马力，机械排灌面积，约占需要机械排灌的耕地面积20％左右。农村电站发展到二十万瓩。水利施工和农村运输方面，也开始采取了若干机械化和半机械化的措施，农用汽车和胶轮车等正在逐步增加。农业机械工业的建设也获得了相当的发展，我们已经建成了具有世界先进技术水平的洛阳第一拖拉机厂和其他的一些工厂，农业机械产品的年产量，目前已经达到了一个相当规模的水平。当然，这些成就对于我国实现农业现代化这个伟大目标来说，还只是事情的开始。
        农业机械工业处于
        特大跃进的新情况中
    社会主义建设大跃进的胜利和人民公社化的实现，为农业的技术改造创造了必要的前提
  条件，同时也带来了农业技术改造的迫切要求。党中央和毛泽东同志适时地提出了加速农业技术改造的指示，力争在十年左右的时间内基本上实现农业机械化，规定了从1959年起，四年小解决、七年中解决、十年大解决的实施步骤。根据这个指示，国务院于去年8月间决定成立
  了农业机械工业部门，同时，强调提出了工业支援农业的号召，采取了一系列的积极措施。1960年国家拨给农业机械工业方面使用的钢材达一百一十万吨，比1959年增加一倍左右。基本建设投资也有大量增加。可以说农业机械工业目前正处在特大跃进的新情况中。根据国家计划，1960年比之1959年机械化和半机械化农具的生产都有大量的增加：拖拉机二万二千个标准台，增长293％，联合收割机二千台，增长60％，排灌机械二百五十万马力，增长40％，畜牧机械八千四百一十台，增长230％，农村小型电站二十万到三十万瓩，增长300％到500％，半机械化农具和运输工具二千三百八十五万部，增长400％。完成了上述计划，到今年年底，农业方面将拥有拖拉机八万一千标准台，联合收割机六千九百台，排灌机械动力五百八十八万马力，农村小型电站四十五万瓩。机耕面积将达到一万一千二百万亩，约占全国耕地面积的6.9％，机械排灌面积将达到二万六千五百万亩，约占全国需要机械排灌面积的38％。完成了上述计划后，1960年农村新增加的农业机械化产品，折合成机械动力计算，约等于五百万左右的马力，按一个马力抵四个劳动力计算，即相当于增加了二千万个劳动力。新增加的大量的半机械化产品约等于增加一千万个以上的劳动力。这两项合计即等于为农村增加了共约三千万个以上的劳动力，相当于农村现有劳动力的14％左右。大家知道，三千万个劳动力，如果充分地利用起来，这将会为我们的社会主义建设，创造出多么巨大的财富。
    在党中央和国务院的号召下，现在全国各个地区各个部门一直到人民解放军，到处都掀起了工业支援农业的热潮。农业机械工业企业系统和广大农村对于农具工具改良的技术革新、技术革命运动，也正在波澜壮阔地不断高涨着。这是农业技术革命运动中两支互相促进互相影响的洪流。不少地区在通过“厂（工厂）社（公社）挂钩”这个新的形式下，正在使这两支洪流日益密切地互相结合起来。这就是目前农业技术改造方面跃进的新形势。这种大好形势，既向我们展示了加速农业技术改造的光辉前景，同时也为我们提供了如何加速实现我国农业机械化的正确途径。
    以下我想就如何实现我国农业机械化的问题，说一点初步的体会。
      农业机械化的根本
        问题是大搞群众运动
    实现我国农业机械化的基本要求，一方面必须坚决按照党的总路线的精神，做到多快好省，逐步满足农业生产和林、牧、副、渔各业生产不断跃进所需要的技术装备，促使农业的发展能够和工业的发展互相适应。这是保证社会主义建设持久跃进的一个极为重要的条件。一方面又必须根据我国的特点，适合“农业八字宪法”的全面需要和一整套精耕细作制度的需要，在有效地提高农业劳动生产率的基础上，同时不断地提高农作物单位面积产量，使工业原料和人民生活对农产品不断增长的需要得到保证。这是一个非常艰巨而又非常复杂的任务，我们有信心也有一切可能逐步地完成这个任务。
    怎样来实现上述的这个任务呢？我们认为根本关键在于坚决贯彻实行社会主义建设的总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，关键在于大搞群众运动。而大搞群众运动，又是彻底实现总路线和两条腿走路方针的基础。因此实现农业机械化的根本问题，首先就是如何大搞群众运动的问题。
    农业机械化战线上的群众运动，有两个方面。一方面是五亿多农民改良农具工具的群众运动。这个运动，经过多年来特别是大跃进和人民公社化以来，获得了极为广泛的发展，现在正向着系列化、半机械化的方向不断前进，这是实现我国农业机械化的基础。另一方面是农业机械工业企业内部和科学技术研究部门中的群众运动。这一方面的运动，也已经获得了许多成就，在生产工艺、产品设计、原材料节约、基本建设和企业管理制度等方面的新创造，正在不断出现。这就是农业机械工业战线上目前正在蓬勃发展着的技术革新和技术革命运动。这两个方面的运动现时在工业支援农业的号召下，在“厂社挂钩”的形式下，日益相互结合和相互促进。这种厂社挂钩的形式，就是国家的一般工厂、矿山企业特别是农业机械制造和修理企业分别地和附近地区的一个或几个公社建立技术合作协定，实行互相合作，互相支援和互相学习。工厂实行技术下乡，如对机器使用实行包教、包修等。这种形式有利于发展工业和农业、城市和乡村的结合，也有利于发展和巩固现阶段的工农联盟。上海市的工人和郊区农民对于这两大运动的结合发出了这样的赞歌：“工农联盟力量大，技术革命开红花，工人农民齐动手，大小关键攻破它，一厂一社难解决，全区全县包来打，天大困难也不怕，胜利一定属大家”。进一步全面规划，加强领导，不断地发展这两个方面的群众运动，并使其在广大农村改良农具工具的半机械化运动的基础上，更好地密切结合，不断提高，就一定会更有力地推进农业的技术革命，就一定会大大加速我国农业机械化任务的顺利实现。应该指出：为了顺利地加速实现农业机械化，我们必须极大地重视农村的农具改良运动。事情很明显，如果离开五亿多广大农民改良农具的半机械化运动这个基础，那就不可能解决农业机械化中的任何重大问题。首先从农业机械产品的设计方面举例来说吧，比如世界各国长期以来未获解决，而我们现在已经基本定型的水稻插秧机就是在改良农具的群众运动中创造出来的，其中有的优良型号如最近在缅甸表演大受欢迎的醴陵号插秧机，就是农民贺继生同志创造发明的。从农业机械工业企业的技术改造来说也是如此，现在人民公社所拥有的那些具有现代机器的农具制造修理厂，也大都是在改良农具的群众运动中由土到洋生长发展起来的。山东德州的第一机械厂就正是这样一个由露天钉马掌的合作小组，发展成为拥有六百工人，几十台洋机器的机械厂。这是一个十分动人的例子，像这样的例子，还可以举出不少。
      农业机械化要从
        我国的实际需要出发
    必须批判这样一种思想，以为搞农业机械化，就可以不顾我国的自然条件和精耕细作的优良传统，而只是简单地照搬国外的现成产品和现成经验。当然，按照我国的具体条件学习和参考国外的先进经验，是重要的。但是，更重要的是要根据群众的创造，从我国农业生产的实际需要出发，从农、林、牧、副、渔各业生产的多种多样的需要出发，从农田水利施工、交通运输、农村建筑、乡村工业等各项实际需要出发，不断设计和创造适合我国条件的，即园田化的、精耕细作的、大中小结合的、结构精密的、因地制宜而又能综合利用的农业机械。为了解决这个任务，当然要大力发展科学技术研究试验工作，要充分发挥农业机械科学技术人员的积极性和创造性。但是，这种科学研究工作如果离开了五亿多农民改良农具的群众运动和工厂企业中技术革新技术革命运动，如果只靠一些科学研究机关关门研究，那是一定不可能有什么重大成就的。
    另外一种意见也是必须批判的，那就是认为搞农业机械化，就只要国家拿出大量的农业机器来就够了，不必去依靠广大农民，也不必去依靠人民公社，更不必去不断提高农民的社会主义觉悟和不断巩固人民公社了。他们不了解农业机械化的实现，应该和不断改进农村的上层建筑和生产关系相结合，应该和巩固人民公社，发展公社经济，逐步实现公社工业化相结合，应该使国家的支援和公社自身的力量相结合。应该指出农业机械化运动，是全体人民特别是五亿多农民自己的切身事业，它必须是一个广泛而深刻的群众运动，离开群众运动，离开人民公社的巩固和公社经济、公社工业的发展就不可能真正地更不可能加速实现农业机械化。
    还有一种意见也是需要批判的。那就是以为农业机械化，一下子就可以完全依靠现代设备和现代农业机械。他们否认运动发展的辩证过程，不承认半机械化的必要性，不承认土办法的重要作用，看不到土中可以出洋，不了解改良农具是现代农业机械之母，因而，他们实际上也否定了两条腿走路的方针。应该肯定由半机械化到机械化正是实现农业机械化的必经过程，也是实现农业技术改造这样一种群众运动的发展过程。只有洋土结合的方针，机械化和半机械化结合的两条腿走路的方针，才是加速实现农业机械化的唯一正确的方针。尤其在最近几年内，必须坚持以半机械化和改良农具为主。只有彻底地批判了上述的各式各样的不正确意见和错误思想，才能使农业机械化这条战线上的群众运动更好地持久地开展起来。也只有搞好了群众运动，才能真正地加速实现农业的机械化。
    各位代表：加速实现我国农业技术改造这个宏伟的艰巨工程已经开始大举进军了。我国广大农民长期憧憬着的“耕田不用牛，点灯不用油，旱涝不用愁”的新时代，正在逐步向我们迫近了。这标志着根本改变我国经济面貌的新时期正在开始到来。毛泽东同志曾经指出过“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”由于农业技术改造将要加速实现，我国农业的继续跃进、全国农业发展纲要的提前实现，将会得到更大保证；人民公社和工农联盟也将在一个新的基础上获得进一步巩固和发展；人民生活也将逐步地得到更大的提高；社会主义建设也将获得更好更全面的持久跃进。我们深信在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，高举毛泽东思想这个无坚不摧、无往不胜的锐利武器，依靠着广大职工和五亿多农民的努力，不断地克服困难，就一定能够逐步地加速实现农业技术改造的伟大任务。
    农业机械部门成立不久。机构不全，情况不熟，经验缺乏，任务紧迫，工作中的缺点不少，请大家帮助发现问题，提出批评。
    上述发言不当之处，请予指正。
