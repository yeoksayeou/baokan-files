Yancheng Prefecture Reforms Crop Cultivation Techniques
Learn from the Experience of Suzhou Prefecture and Strive to Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu in Spring Planting Quality

(Our report) The broad masses of the rural population in Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are vigorously engaged in a revolution in crop cultivation techniques, aiming to make the quality of this year's spring-sown crops catch up with the Southern Jiangsu region.

Under the battle cry of "Stepping Out of Yancheng to Catch Up with Southern Jiangsu," the people of Yancheng Prefecture have been working hard for a hundred days and have now achieved great results. With the arrival of the spring plowing and sowing season, the Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has promptly launched a technical innovation movement focused on the cultivation and management of various agricultural crops throughout the region.

In terms of crop varieties, considering that the frost-free period in Yancheng is slightly shorter than in Suzhou, the first step is to change from late-maturing varieties to early-maturing varieties. This year, the area planted with early rice in the prefecture has increased by 14% compared to last year, and the area planted with late rice has been appropriately reduced; at the same time, the focus is on replacing low-yield varieties with high-yield varieties, centered on changing *xian* rice to *japonica* rice. Yancheng Prefecture has traditionally grown low-yield, late-maturing native varieties, with a mix of varieties, up to more than a hundred kinds. Although many improved varieties have been introduced in recent years, the improved varieties could not maintain their purity because they were not planted in continuous areas. This year, in addition to retaining a small amount of high-yield native varieties for experimental cultivation, the native varieties have been basically eliminated, and *japonica* rice has been used to replace *xian* rice. More than 30 million *jin* of improved varieties have been introduced from Southern Jiangsu, and the area planted with *japonica* rice has increased by 60% compared to last year. Cotton also entirely uses improved varieties of Dai character cotton.

This year, the sowing season for various crops has been characterized by starting early. Party committees at all levels analyzed the reasons why rice yields in Yancheng are lower than those in Suzhou. In addition to different fertilization levels, the main reason is that Suzhou firmly grasped the concept of "early." In Suzhou, the planting of mid-season rice "Huangke Zao" is completed before June 10, with a yield of 800 to 1,000 *jin* per *mu*, while in Yancheng, "Huangke Zao" is planted until the end of June, yielding only 300 to 400 *jin* per *mu*, and as low as 100 to 200 *jin* in some cases. This year, we are focusing on "early," and early rice began soaking seeds around March 15, more than 20 days earlier than in previous years. In order to solve the contradiction that low temperatures easily cause seedling rot, various places have made major reforms to the location of seedling beds and the method of sowing. The old habit of sowing in fields used for single-season rice cultivation (where the ground temperature is low) has been changed, and most seedling beds are made in winter-fallow fields, green manure fields, and threshing grounds; the method of sowing has been changed from sowing in water to sowing in ash, and measures such as covering with straw mats, fumigating with smoke, and building heating stoves at the head of the fields have been taken to prevent cold and frost.

In terms of farming systems, advanced intercropping systems will be gradually adopted from this year onwards to replace the previous single cropping system. This year, the unreasonable layout of dry land surrounding water and water surrounding dry land will be changed, and mixed planting of water and dry land crops will be changed to continuous planting. At the same time, intercropping and interplanting will be promoted to increase land utilization.

In order to adapt to a series of reforms in crop cultivation and management, in addition to vigorously grasping measures such as raising pigs to accumulate manure and planting more green manure, the experience of Suzhou Prefecture in using grass mud ponds for fertilizer production has been adopted. In just two months, more than 3.7 million grass mud ponds have been dug throughout the prefecture, averaging one pond for every three *mu* of land. Now, more than 80% of the ponds have been filled with fertilizer and the first turning of the ponds has already begun. This revolutionary measure will expand the fertilized area throughout the prefecture by 30% compared to previous years, achieving fertilization for every *mu*, with each *mu* receiving about 200 *dan* of fertilizer.

In the technical innovation movement, Party committees at all levels generally take "Little Southern Jiangsu" as the foundation, personally setting examples and organizing on-site visits for each technical aspect. At the beginning of the spring planting campaign, in addition to organizing the broad masses to discuss the newly revised technical operating procedures, Party committees at all levels and relevant departments also held more than 20,000 on-site meetings.

In addition to widely disseminating new technologies among the masses through the "Little Southern Jiangsu" technical innovation classroom, agricultural departments in various places have also specially trained nearly 300,000 technical backbone personnel for rice, cotton, oil crops, miscellaneous grains, and other special economic crops.

The technical innovation movement centered on crop cultivation and management has given Yancheng's first spring planting the characteristics of early action, new technology, high quality, and great momentum in catching up with Southern Jiangsu. More than 4 million *mu* of spring fields throughout the prefecture are all connected into continuous areas of hundreds of *mu*, thousands of *mu*, and even thousands of *mu*. These fields are deeply ploughed, finely harrowed, and have level ridges and straight paths, stretching as far as the eye can see. Now, seeds have been sown in 1.03 million *mu* of early rice, and the early sown seeds have already sprouted; the soaking of seeds for mid-season rice has also begun. Cotton will be sown comprehensively during the Qingming Festival.

    早字带头　采用良种　间作套种　狠抓积肥
    盐城专区改革作物栽培技术
    学习苏州专区经验力争春播质量赶上江南
    本报讯　江苏省盐城专区广大农村大闹作物栽培技术革命，要使今年春播作物的质量赶上江南地区。
    盐城专区人民在“跨出盐城赶江南”的战斗口号下，已经大干一百天，现在取得了很大成绩。随着春耕播种季节的来到，中共盐城地委又及时地在全区范围内开展了一个以各种农作物栽培管理为中心的技术革新运动。
    在作物品种方面，根据盐城地区无霜期比苏州略短的情况，首先改晚熟品种为早熟品种。今年全区早稻面积比去年扩大了14％，适当缩小了晚稻面积；同时以籼改粳为中心改低产品种为高产品种。盐城专区一向种的是低产晚熟土种，品种混杂，多至一百多种，近几年中虽然引进不少良种，但由于未连片种植，良种不能保持纯度。今年除留少量高产土种作试验性栽培外，基本上淘汰了土种，实现以粳代  籼，从江南引进良种三千多万斤，粳稻面积比去年扩大了60％。棉花也全部选用良种岱字棉。
    各种作物的播种季节，今年都做到了早字当头。各级党委分析研究了盐城地区水稻产量低于苏州的原因，除了施肥水平不同外，主要是苏州地区紧紧掌握了“早”字。苏州地区中稻“黄壳早”6月10日前全部栽完，每亩产量八百到一千斤，盐城地区“黄壳早”要栽到6月底，每亩只收三、四百斤，低的只有一、二百斤。今年狠抓“早”字，早稻在3月15日左右就开始浸种，比往年提前二十多天。为了解决气温低容易烂秧的矛盾，各地对秧池的位置和落谷方法进行了大改革。改变过去在一熟沤田（地温低）落谷的老习惯，大部分用冬闲田、绿肥田和场基做秧池；落谷方法改下水秧为下灰秧，并采取盖草帘、熏烟、砌田头加温灶等办法防寒防冻。
    在耕作制度方面，从今年起逐步采用先进的套作制度代替过去的单一耕作制度。今年首先改变水包旱，旱包水的不合理的布局，改水旱作物混杂种植为连片种植，同时推行间作、套作，提高土地利用率。
    为了适应作物栽培管理方面一系列的改革，除了狠抓养猪积肥、多种绿肥等措施外，接受了苏州专区草泥塘沤肥的经验，全区在短短两个月时间里，共挖草泥塘三百七十多万个，平均三亩田一个塘，现在80％以上的塘已沤满肥料，并已开始第一次翻塘。这一革命性的措施将使全区施肥面积比往年扩大30％，达到亩亩有肥，每亩可施肥二百担左右。
    在技术革新运动中，各级党委普遍以“小江南”为基点，亲自动手做样子，项项技术搞现场参观。春播运动一开始，各级党委和有关部门组织广大群众讨论新订的技术操作规程以外，还召开了两万多个现场会。
    除了通过“小江南”这一技术革新的课堂广泛地在群众中传播新技术以外，各地农业部门还专门培训了水稻、棉花、油料、杂谷以及其它特种经济作物技术骨干近三十万人。
    以农作物栽培管理为中心的技术革新运动，使盐城地区赶江南的第一个春播具有行动早、技术新、质量高、气派大的特色。全区四百多万亩春田都是百亩、千亩以至数千亩连成一片，这些田耕得深、耙得细、畦平路直，一望无边。现在一百零三万亩早稻普遍落谷，落谷早的已出苗；中稻也已开始浸种。棉花在清明全面播种。
