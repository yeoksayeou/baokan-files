Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, April 9th: On the eve of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Conakry, the Secretary-General of the Algerian Provisional Government's Foreign Ministry, Saad Dahlab, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters here, "Imperialism must be eliminated."

He also said, "We firmly believe that the entire African continent will achieve complete liberation. 1960 will prove that, on the one hand, Africa's liberation movement will be more vigorous and resolute, and on the other hand, the countries that have recently gained independence will consolidate their independence and sovereignty."

Saad Dahlab left here for Amman on the afternoon of the 8th after a four-day visit to the Syrian region. He is visiting various Arab countries, including Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, to inform responsible officials there about Algeria's recent developments.

Dahlab visited China in 1958 as a member of the Algerian Provisional Government delegation. He said that the friendly relations between the Algerian people and the great Chinese people are very close. He believes that the experience of the Chinese revolution and the great strides made by the Chinese people in all aspects have encouraged the Algerian people and all African people struggling for national independence.

He condemned France's second atomic explosion in North Africa. He said that this explosion is considered an act that disregards world opinion.

Dahlab further said that the people of the world have now seen with their own eyes that French imperialists are massacring the Algerian people, threatening the entire African continent, and threatening world peace. Unless effective measures are taken, French imperialists will not stop their crimes.

Referring to the massacres in South Africa, he said that the South African events once again show that imperialists and racists are stubborn, and imperialism must be eliminated. He also called for an end to racial discrimination. He pointed out that it is impossible for extreme reactionaries to continue to impose so-called laws on all people.

The Algerian official also pointed out that Africans must be more vigilant against imperialists, because imperialists will never stop playing despicable conspiracies.

He pointed out that de Gaulle is clamoring that he is trying to resolve the Algerian issue peacefully and democratically, attempting to deceive world opinion in this way. Dahlab said that the Algerian people will not be deceived. They will fight more resolutely for complete freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th, Kuala Lumpur dispatch: Belhami, the permanent representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front in Southeast Asia, who recently arrived in Kuala Lumpur, said on the 7th that as long as the French government continues to take high-handed measures against the Algerian people, the Algerian people's struggle for independence will continue until independence is achieved.

Belhami said that whether the issue of Algerian national independence is resolved peacefully depends entirely on the French government. He pointed out that the French government must bear full responsibility for the Algerian war that has lasted for five and a half years.

Belhami accused the French army of still carrying out inhuman massacres against the Algerian people. He said, "They are using aircraft to bomb unarmed residents."

Belhami condemned the French government's recent atomic explosion in the Sahara Desert.

    阿尔及利亚外交部秘书长谈非洲民族独立斗争
    整个非洲将获得完全解放
    新华社大马士革9日电　阿尔及利亚临时政府外交部秘书长沙阿德·达列伯在科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会前夕在这里单独接见新华社记者时说，“必须消灭帝国主义。”
    他还说，“我们坚信，整个非洲将获得完全解放。1960年将证明，一方面非洲的解放运动将更加有力和坚决，另一方面最近刚获得独立的国家将巩固自己的独立和主权。”
    沙阿德·达列伯在叙利亚地区访问了四天以后，8日下午离开这里前往安曼。他正在访问各个阿拉伯国家，其中包括约旦、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯和黎巴嫩，把阿尔及利亚最近的形势发展告诉那里的负责官员。
    达列伯在1958年作为阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团团员曾访问过中国。他说，阿尔及利亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间的友好关系是十分密切的。他认为，中国革命的经验和中国人民在各方面的大踏步前进，鼓舞了阿尔及利亚人民和为争取民族独立而斗争的全体非洲人民。
    他谴责法国在北非进行第二次原子爆炸。他说，这种爆炸被认为是不顾世界舆论的行为。
    达列伯又说，现在世界各国人民已经亲眼看到，法帝国主义者正在屠杀阿尔及利亚人民，威胁着整个非洲大陆，并且威胁着世界和平。除非采取有效的措施，法帝国主义者是不会停止他们的罪行的。
    他在谈到南非的屠杀事件时说，南非事件再一次表明帝国主义者和种族主义者是顽固的，必须消灭帝国主义。他还要求停止种族歧视。他指出，极端反动分子要继续把所谓法律强加于全体人民是不可能的。
    这位阿尔及利亚官员还指出，非洲人必须更加对帝国主义者保持警惕，因为帝国主义者决不会停止玩弄卑鄙的阴谋诡计。
    他指出，戴高乐正在叫嚷，他正在设法和平民主解决阿尔及利亚问题，企图这样来欺骗世界舆论。达列伯说，阿尔及利亚人民是不会受骗的。他们将更加坚决为争取完全的自由而斗争。
    新华社10日讯　吉隆坡消息：最近到达吉隆坡的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线东南亚常驻代表贝尔哈米7日表示，在法国政府继续向阿尔及利亚人民采取高压手段的情况下，阿尔及利亚人民的独立斗争将继续坚持下去，直到实现独立为止。
    贝尔哈米说，阿尔及利亚的民族独立问题是否和平解决，完全在于法国政府。他指出，法国政府必须对已经持续五年半的阿尔及利亚战争负全部责任。
    贝尔哈米指责法国军队现在仍然对阿尔及利亚人民作惨无人道的屠杀。他说，“他们用飞机轰炸手无寸铁的居民”。
    贝尔哈米谴责了法国政府不久前在撒哈拉沙漠进行原子爆炸。
