Comrades of the Presidium, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

The workers and peasants across the country are now engaged in a technical innovation and technical revolution movement with soaring enthusiasm, working day and night, intensely and fervently. I believe that this meeting will continue to be a meeting of sustained great leaps forward. Due to illness, I am unable to attend this meeting in person and can only report on the progress of our "辞海" revision work through a written speech. I welcome all representatives and committee members to offer your invaluable advice.

In the autumn of 1957, I was tasked by Chairman Mao to revise the "辞海." At that time, it was envisioned that the old "辞海" took ten years to compile and publish, and the revision of the "辞海" should not take so long. However, considering that the old "辞海" was a product of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial era, published twenty years ago, fundamental revisions and supplements were needed in terms of stance, viewpoints, and scientific content. At the same time, it was also considered that the revised "辞海" would be published in the new China after liberation and must have a higher quality. Therefore, a plan of "one hundred cadres, one million yuan in funding, and five years" was proposed to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. This original idea was actually not feasible. Later, we received instructions from the leadership: "Rely on leadership, organize the forces of various academic research units, and use the 'three-way combination' editing method," and "According to the general classification of disciplines, Shanghai's universities, academic groups, and relevant units will be responsible for specific tasks." Only then did we realize that the revision of the "辞海," like other work, must follow the mass line. We began preparations after September 1957, and in May 1958, the "Zhonghua Book Company 辞海 Editorial Office" was established. In 1959, the "辞海 Editorial Committee" was organized, and the first meeting was held in June to determine the revision's direction and specific work plan, with publication scheduled for 1962. Subsequently, manuscript solicitation began. Around the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, the manuscript solicitation work was basically completed, except for a few categories, and the writing units began to enter the stage of drafting the initial drafts.

The revision of the "辞海" has progressed smoothly under the care and direct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and with the cooperation of relevant units. To date, there are ninety writing units for the "辞海" (or one hundred and forty-two if the "department" of a university is considered a unit; most of these units are in Shanghai, with a few in Beijing, Nanjing, Hefei, Hangzhou, Xiamen, and other places). According to preliminary statistics, the number of participants in the writing is approximately 2,600 or more (including approximately 700 university students). The number of entries has been tentatively determined to be 90,000, with a total word count of approximately 12 million. Under the leadership of the Party, universities, scientific research institutions, and relevant business departments have enthusiastically supported and actively cooperated, including the revision of the "辞海" in their work plans as one of their scientific research tasks. Currently, it can be said that in Shanghai's academic circles, "the whole city is talking about compiling the 辞海." Therefore, the "辞海" may be published in 1961, ahead of the originally scheduled date of 1962. Here, we express our heartfelt thanks to the units and all comrades participating in the writing of the "辞海" for their strong cooperation. We hope that all representatives, committee members, and the national academic community and the general readership will give us your support and cooperation.

The revision of the "辞海," like other work, must be done more, faster, better, and more economically. The central link to achieving this lies in rigorously ensuring quality. This is because: First, the new "辞海" is the first relatively large-scale dictionary published after liberation. After revision, its quality should be of a high standard and truly serve as a common reference book for the general reader to learn social sciences, natural sciences, and cultural knowledge. Second, only by rigorously ensuring quality early on can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economically. The writing units of the "辞海" have their own teaching tasks, scientific research tasks, or administrative tasks. If quality is not emphasized from the beginning, there will be more repetitive labor later, the contradiction with the original tasks of the unit will be greater, the quality will be less guaranteed, and the possibility of early publication will be smaller. Therefore, the sooner we rigorously ensure quality, the more we can achieve more, faster, better, and more economically. Third, it is also necessary to do more, faster, better, and more economically because the high-speed construction of socialism requires the popularization, development, and improvement of culture and education, and the broad masses urgently hope that a suitable dictionary can be published as soon as possible.

Recognizing this, we are making every effort to achieve the high standard of the "辞海." At the same time, we also realize that to achieve this task, we must, under the leadership of the Party and with the strong cooperation of the writing units, resolutely and conscientiously implement the mass line. The "辞海" includes approximately 30,000 linguistic terms and approximately 60,000 encyclopedic terms, covering a wide range of knowledge, encompassing ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, and all aspects. If there is no "comprehensive cooperation and responsibility," this task will be difficult to complete. To complete this glorious task, we must resolutely implement the Party's mass line, that is, the mass line working method that Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "From the masses, to the masses," and "Concentrate ideas and persevere." In specific work, we have taken the following measures:

First, rigorously ensure the quality of the initial draft. This is the primary link in ensuring quality and improving quality.
    (1) Continuously unify understanding. Using the mass line method to compile dictionaries is a new attempt, and we lack experience. We must learn and improve in practice, that is, continuously study and clarify quality standards in the actual writing process, continuously unify understanding, and continuously improve quality. One of our main tasks is to continuously summarize the experience of each writing unit, help discover problems, and conduct joint research so that quality can be continuously improved in the actual writing process. To achieve this goal, we have compiled and printed "辞海 Editing Situation," which is distributed within the writing units. Its main task is to study quality and exchange experiences in improving quality. In addition, we also frequently discuss issues related to improving quality through discipline editorial group meetings and separate discussions with writing units to repeatedly seek unified understanding.
    (2) Compile and print "'辞海' Trial Manuscripts." This was written through the efforts and hard work of all writing units. It is now being sent to all representatives and committee members for review and instruction. The content includes two parts: one part is some principles and preliminary regulations for revising the "辞海," but it is considered not mature enough, and many opinions are not yet consistent; the other part is the content of the explanations, including trial manuscripts (which are the main part), writing research (using the original draft and the revised draft for comparison and explanation), and explanation discussions (discussions of issues that are academically controversial or have different opinions on writing). The purpose of compiling and printing is, first, to attempt to use it as a preliminary quality standard for reference in writing the initial draft; more importantly, it is to widely solicit opinions, request criticism and guidance from superiors, experts, readers, and all representatives and committee members, in order to gather wisdom and make the revised new "辞海" have a high standard.
    (3) Repeatedly revise the draft of the initial draft. To improve the quality of the initial draft, it must be repeatedly studied, repeatedly discussed, and repeatedly revised. On the basis of the "'辞海' Trial Manuscripts," under the guidance of the Editorial Committee, and together with the writing units, the draft will be further discussed and revised repeatedly. It is planned to complete the initial draft in the first half of this year.

Second, we plan to use the summer vacation to adopt a "three-way combination" method for mass comprehensive review. The so-called "three-way combination" mass comprehensive review includes the forces of writing units, experts (experts in various disciplines in China, scientific research institutions, universities, and relevant business departments), and the masses (teachers and students of colleges and universities, middle school teachers, cadres of relevant business departments, factories and enterprises, and people's communes, local institutions, parties concerned, and departments that have information and data). The method adopted is to widely request review of the initial draft by relevant parties throughout the country. In addition, we plan to invite some teachers from universities and middle schools in Shanghai, university students, cadres from business departments, factories, and enterprises, and writing staff to concentrate together, divide into groups, concentrate their efforts, and discuss, review, and revise the quality standards (preliminary opinions will be drafted first), entries, and explanation content by category. This will not only absorb the opinions of experts, but also absorb the opinions of the masses, and learn about the reactions and requirements of different target readers of the "辞海," so that the revised "辞海" can have a broader mass base. Through the mass comprehensive review, major defects and tendency problems in the initial draft can be discovered, and specific opinions can be put forward on entries and explanations to correct errors.

Third, do a good job in revising the initial draft, completing the second draft within the year, and doing a good job in the re-examination of the second draft. After the mass review of the initial draft, the quality standards will be further clarified. Therefore, we are prepared to, on the basis of the mass comprehensive review, under the guidance of the Editorial Committee, and together with the writing staff, repeatedly discuss and revise the initial draft, requiring the completion of the second draft within the year. It can be envisioned that the quality of the second draft, after vigorous revision, will be further guaranteed, and most of the manuscripts can be finalized. The second draft will be re-examined in February and March next year, at which time we can focus on the explanations of a few entries that are more political, policy-oriented, more scientific, and more complex and difficult. Through the re-examination, the quality of the manuscripts will be further improved. If the quality is guaranteed, we hope to complete the third draft (final draft) before "July 1" next year, striving to present it as a gift to the 40th anniversary of the Party.

Here, I would like to report an additional matter to all representatives and committee members: In the fourth meeting of the First National People's Congress in 1957, I suggested establishing a special institution to compile the Encyclopedia of China. Now, I suggest again, whether we can continue to compile a small encyclopedia of 50 million words and ten volumes after we have completed the revision of the "辞海" and have gained some experience. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, adopting the mass line, widely mobilizing the forces of the academic community, and cooperating comprehensively, we can compile and publish such a reference book in a relatively short period. If this suggestion is adopted, we hope that the national academic community will give us strong support and full cooperation.

In our work, we have taken some detours. After a period of practice, we gradually realized that to revise the "辞海" more, faster, better, and more economically, we must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. After we realized that we must resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, our work progressed very smoothly, all staff members were in a happy mood, and they were full of confidence, all believing that we would be able to complete this glorious task entrusted to us by the Party. Here, I would like to talk about two points of experience in our work:

First, the combination of Party leadership and the mass movement is the fundamental method for all work and the fundamental guarantee for completing all work outstandingly. We have once again proved this well-tested truth from the work of revising the "辞海."

On this issue, we have experience and lessons. As mentioned above, we once envisioned: "One hundred cadres, one million yuan in funding, and five years," which was to revise the "辞海" behind closed doors with the "expert line" as the guiding ideology, which was a slow, poor, and wasteful approach. The Party pointed out that the "three-way combination" editing method corrected our thinking. Initially, after we proposed "open-door manuscript solicitation" and assigned all writing tasks to universities, scientific research institutions, and a few business departments, the more common thinking among the editing cadres was to rely on their own processing and revision. What was discussed and calculated daily was how many entries could be reviewed and revised in a day and how much time it would take to complete the review and revision tasks. As for how to improve quality, little consideration was given for a relatively long period of time. (The lesson here is that the serious focus on quality came a step late, which caused the cadres in the office to feel depressed and caused the writing units to have repetitive labor that could have been avoided.) After the comrades in the office studied the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session last August and September, they were full of vigor and put forward the goal of striving to present the final draft to the 40th anniversary of the Party. The writing units actively responded and organized forces to start writing. However, the cadres in the office found that the quality of some of the manuscripts was not high, and they began to complain and grumble, and some cadres even doubted the writing method of using the mass line. In response to this situation, and in conjunction with learning, we proposed to the cadres that not only should we rely on the masses to write, but also mobilize the masses to review. Initially, many cadres had ideological resistance, thinking that doing so would prevent them from controlling their own destiny and the quality would not be guaranteed. After learning, and at the same time proposing to rigorously ensure quality, we studied quality issues from the manuscripts and began publishing "辞海 Editing Situation" to introduce experience and discuss quality, which only initially gained understanding. However, because the quality problem was not well resolved in actual work, the quality of a large number of incoming manuscripts was still not high, so that suspicion and distrust resurfaced, with emotions of neither trusting the writing units nor having confidence in themselves. We then proposed to study Chairman Mao's mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses" and "concentrate ideas and persevere," to study the main reasons for the poor quality from the incoming manuscripts, and to select several representative entries, using the method of dissecting a sparrow, to study the quality issues from the content (the initial approach was to offer opinions one by one, and most of them belonged to writing style and text compression), and to introduce and propose discussions in the "辞海 Editing Situation." In addition, the editing cadres personally went to the writing units and discussed and studied with the writers, and held enlarged meetings of the discipline editorial group (absorbing the main writers) for discussion. After these tasks, the writing units generally reflected that the assistance was great, and gradually clarified the quality standards required by the "辞海"; and also changed the writing method, from a few people burying themselves in writing to mobilizing teachers and students to discuss and revise together. We also asked the cadres in the office to further clarify the quality standards and assist the writing units. Especially through this work of compiling and printing "'辞海' Trial Manuscripts," all cadres had a deep understanding and realized that we must rely on the masses, and only by relying on the masses and launching a large-scale mass movement to revise the "辞海" can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economically. With the support and leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, this work was launched on a broad scale, and the work was relatively in-depth and meticulous. This time, the Party committees of all writing units attached great importance to the trial manuscript, and the responsible comrades of many units personally mobilized and regarded it as a top scientific research task. Generally, after repeated discussions, revisions, and layer-by-layer reviews by each unit, the final draft was sent to our office for summary. After compiling and mimeographing, after a small-scale mass review, enlarged small group meetings of the discipline editorial group were convened to study, and many categories were discussed entry by entry. Several categories almost proposed revisions to each entry, correcting many political, scientific, and factual errors. Moreover, through discussion, several major issues related to quality in each discipline were further discovered and clarified. It was then returned to the writing units and reprinted after another revision. In the process of printing, the proofs were once again sent to the writing units for proofreading and revision. For example, the political and legal affairs editorial group also underwent a collective revision. It seems initially that the problem is that the style is still very inconsistent (which will be easily resolved later), but the quality of the explanation content has been greatly improved. Of course, it is not that the quality of the trial manuscript is already very high, but it is only to say that the quality has improved a lot compared to the previous stage. In fact, many problems were found even in the process of proofreading. In order to catch up with the meeting, there was not enough time for thorough revision. Fortunately, this is a trial manuscript, and the quality can be gradually improved through several reviews and revisions in the future. I mentioned above: "The whole city is talking about compiling the 辞海," which truly reflects the actual situation of the mass movement to revise the "辞海" in recent months. Now, a kind of public opinion has begun to form inside and outside the office: the revision of the "辞海" must involve a large-scale mass movement.

Second, to improve the quality of the "辞海," the explanation content must conscientiously implement Mao Zedong Thought. But this is not a simple task, and it requires a serious study process and arduous ideological work.

The Party instructed: The revised "辞海" is a comprehensive dictionary that focuses on encyclopedic knowledge and takes into account single characters and words. The writing content of encyclopedia and words must be correct, in line with the standpoints and viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism, and strive to explain the latest scientific achievements; the explanation should be concise and easy to understand, suitable for people with intermediate cultural levels. We gradually realized this instruction. After the Editorial Committee proposed to implement the principles of politics, science, and popularization, it seemed clear at the time; but as the work deepened and we came into contact with actual writing, we felt that it was not clear enough. How to implement this principle in the writing content? What exactly is considered high quality? Saying it again and again is just "three-ness," staying at the level of abstract concepts, feeling that there is a lack of methods. Then, the leadership instructed that the writing of the "辞海" must implement Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, the quality standard was further clarified, and we began to realize that to have a high standard of quality, we must implement Mao Zedong Thought.

Implementing Mao Zedong Thought is a serious task and a scientific research task of great significance. To give complete, clear, and scientific explanations to many entries, we must conduct comprehensive, serious research, analysis, and summarization of Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies and instructions, and we cannot take things out of context. Otherwise, serious political errors will occur. It now seems that we still have to go through a very arduous study process in this regard. Taking the entry "peaceful transformation" as an example, the draft (see the trial manuscript) only explains changing capitalist ownership to socialist ownership, and does not explain transforming capitalists into self-reliant laborers, thus neglecting the more important and more essential meaning of "peaceful transformation." This is contrary to Mao Zedong Thought.

Starting from reality, systematically expounding our country's general line of the democratic revolution, the general line of the transition period, and the general line of socialist construction, fully reflecting the major theories in the process of revolutionary struggle and production struggle, and fully reflecting the latest scientific achievements are the fundamental issues in implementing Mao Zedong Thought and guaranteeing the quality of the "辞海." This is a high degree of politics and a high degree of science. According to preliminary inspection, many important entries reflecting the current general line and the Great Leap Forward have not been absorbed; the explanation content of the entries that have been included has not fully reflected or has not reflected the latest achievements at all, and there are still shortcomings of being divorced from politics and divorced from reality. For example, when writing the entry "anti-encirclement disk," the draft only explained the technical content of the anti-encirclement disk, and did not explain that it was the invention of worker Zhang Mingshan, and the great significance of promoting production at that time, thinking that it still had technical shortcomings, so it avoided talking about it. When writing "small blast furnace," it only introduced technical issues, and did not mention the great significance of combining indigenous and foreign methods for large-scale steelmaking and the Great Leap Forward. In the linguistic part, to scientifically explain ancient Chinese, we must correctly grasp the historical viewpoint, and we cannot replace the original meaning of ancient Chinese with the thoughts and language of modern people, nor can we use the explanations of the ancients to make modern people understand. We should have an objective attitude and enable modern people to correctly understand the original meaning of ancient Chinese (we call it "restore its original appearance"). This issue is still controversial.

In short, we realize that only by implementing Mao Zedong Thought can the new "辞海" have a high standard of quality. At present, in the implementation, although there are still difficulties and problems; but we firmly believe that as long as we study conscientiously and implement resolutely, difficulties can be overcome and problems can be gradually solved.

Now, under the leadership of the Party, we are full of confidence, adopting the editing method of the mass line, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening ideological leadership, strengthening cooperation in many aspects, and striving for the high standard of the "辞海"!

    争取“辞海”的高度水平
    舒新城代表的发言主席团、各位代表、各位委员：
    现在全国各地的工人和农民以冲天干劲，废寝忘餐，热烈紧张地展开技术革新和技术革命运动，我的内心非常激动。这次会议，我相信仍将是持续大跃进的会议。我因病不能亲自出席这次会议，只能以书面发言来汇报我们进行“辞海”修订工作的情况，请各位代表、各位委员不吝指教。
    1957年秋，奉毛主席命修订“辞海”。当时曾设想：旧“辞海”经过十年的编写时间才出版；修订“辞海”应该不要这么长的时间。但考虑到旧“辞海”是半封建半殖民地时的产物，出版于二十年前，不论在立场观点和科学内容各方面，都要作根本性的修改和补充；同时又考虑到，修订后的“辞海”是在解放后的新中国出版的，一定要有更高的质量。因此，曾向中共上海市委提出“百位干部、百万元经费和五年时间”的计划。这个原始想法，实际上是行不通的；后来又得到领导上的指示：“依靠领导，组织各学术研究单位的力量和编辑部三结合的编辑方法”，“按照学科的大体分类，分别由上海各高等学校、学术团体及有关单位，分工负责包干”。这时我们才认识到，修订“辞海”和其他工作一样，必须走群众路线。我们于1957年9月后进行筹备，1958年5月成立“中华书局辞海编辑所”；1959年又组织“辞海编辑委员会”，于6月间召开第一次会议，确定了修订的方针和具体工作计划，预定在1962年出版。接着就开始组稿，至庆祝建国十周年前后，除个别门类外，组稿工作基本完成，各编写单位开始进入编写初稿阶段。
    修订“辞海”，在中共上海市委的关怀与直接领导下，取得有关单位的协作，工作进展是顺利的。到目前为止，“辞海”的编写单位已有九十个，（如以大学的“系”作为单位，则有一百四十二个；这些单位绝大部分在上海，个别在北京、南京、合肥、杭州、厦门等地。）参加编写的人数，据初步统计，约在二千六百人以上（其中包括大学生约七百人）词目初步确定为九万条，总字数约计一千二百万字。在党的领导下，各高等学校、科学研究机关和有关业务部门都热烈支持和大力协作，把修订“辞海”列入工作规划，作为科学研究任务之一。目前，在上海学术界可说是“满城争说编辞海”。因此，“辞海”有可能从原定1962年出版提前在1961年出版。在这里，我们对参加编写“辞海”的单位和全体同志的大力协作，致以衷心的感谢。希望各位代表、各位委员及全国学术界、广大读者，给我们支持和协作。
    “辞海”的修订工作，与其他工作一样　必须多快好省。要做到这点，其中心环节在于狠抓质量。这是因为：第一，新的“辞海”，是解放后出版的第一部比较大型的辞书。经过修订，其质量应具有高度水平，并真正起到为一般读者学习社会科学、自然科学和文化知识的普通工具书作用。第二，只有及早狠抓质量，才能多快好省。“辞海”的编写单位，都有自己的教学任务、科学研究任务或行政任务，如果不是一开始就重视抓质量，那么以后的重复劳动就多，与本单位原有任务的矛盾就越大，质量也越没有保证，提前出版的可能性就越小。所以，越是及早狠抓质量，便越能做到多快好省。第三，必须多快好省，还由于高速度建设社会主义，要求文化教育大普及、大发展、大提高，广大群众迫切盼望一本适用的辞书能早日出版。
    我们认识到这一点，因此，正在千方百计为争取“辞海”的高度水平进行一系列工作。同时我们也认识到要实现这个任务，必须在党的领导下，在编写单位的大力协作下，坚决地、认真地贯彻群众路线。“辞海”包括语词约三万条和百科词汇约六万条，知识面很广泛，古今中外，包罗万象，如果不是各方面的“全面协作，包干负责”，这个任务是很难完成的。我们要完成这个光荣任务，必须坚决贯彻党的群众路线，即毛主席谆谆教导我们的：“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来，坚持下去”的群众路线工作方法。在具体工作中，我们采取了以下一些措施：
    第一，狠狠地抓初稿质量。这是保证质量、提高质量的首要环节。
      （一）不断地统一认识。采用群众路线的办法编纂辞书，是一个新的尝试，我们还缺乏经验，必须在实践中边学习，边提高，即在实际编写过程中不断地钻研、明确质量标准，不断地统一认识，不断地提高质量。我们主要任务之一，是不断总结各编写单位的经验，帮助发现问题，共同研究，使得在实际编写过程中不断提高质量。为了达到这个目的，我们编印了“辞海编辑情况”，在编写单位内发行，它的主要任务就是研究质量，交流提高质量的经验；此外，我们还经常通过学科编委小组会以及分别和编写单位讨论提高质量问题，反复求得统一认识。
      （二）编印“‘辞海’试写稿”。这是经过全体编写单位的努力突击编写出来的。现在分送各位代表、各位委员，请予审查、指示。内容包括两个部分：一部分为修订“辞海”的一些原则、初步规定，但考虑还不够成熟，其中不少意见还没有一致；另一部分为释文内容，有试写稿（是主要部分），写稿研究（用原草稿和修改稿对照并加说明），释文讨论（学术上有争论的以及写法上有分歧意见的问题的讨论）。编印的目的，一是企图通过它作为初步的质量标准，暂时用来供编写初稿的参考；更重要的目的，是在于通过它广泛征求意见，请求上级、专家、读者以及各位代表、各位委员批评指教，以期集思广益，使修订后的新“辞海”具有高度水平。
      （三）反复修改初稿的草稿。要提高初稿质量，必须经过反复钻研、反复讨论、反复修改。在“辞海”试写稿的基础上，在编委会的指导下，和编写单位一起，进一步反复讨论草稿，反复进行修改。预定在今年上半年完成初稿。
    第二，拟利用暑假，采取“三结合”的办法进行群众性全面审查。所谓“三结合”的群众性全面审查，即包括编写单位、专家（国内各门学科的专家、科学研究机关、高等学校和有关业务部门）、群众（大专院校师生、中学教师、有关业务部门和工厂企业、人民公社干部、当地机关、当事人以及掌握情况和资料的部门）三方面力量的审查。采取的办法，除将初稿分送全国各地有关方面广泛请求审查外，拟邀请上海部分大、中学教师，大学生，业务部门和工厂企业干部，以及编写人员，集中在一起，分成小组，集中力量，分门别类地对质量标准（先拟出初步意见）、词目及释文内容进行讨论、审查和修改。这样做，既可吸收专家的意见，又可吸收群众的意见，并从中了解不同读者对象对“辞海”的反映和要求，使修订后的“辞海”能有更为广泛的群众基础。通过群众性的全面审查，既能发现初稿中重大缺陷和倾向性问题，也能对词目、释文提出具体意见，纠正错误。
    第三，抓好修改初稿工作，年内完成二稿，并对二稿做好复审工作。初稿经过群众性审查，质量标准将会进一步明确。因此，我们准备在群众性全面审查基础上，在编委会指导下，再和编写人员一起，反复讨论，修改初稿，要求在年内完成二稿。可以设想，经大力修改后的二稿，质量将进一步得到保证，并使大部分稿件能肯定下来。明年2、3月间对二稿进行复审，那时，就可以把重点放在少数政治性、政策性更强，科学性更高，以及比较复杂、比较困难的一些词目的释文上。通过复审，稿件质量将更提高一步。如果质量有保证，我们希望明年“七一”以前完成三稿（定稿），争取向党的四十周年献礼。
    在这里，我附带向各位代表、各位委员报告一件事：我在1957年第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议中曾建议成立专门机构，编辑中国百科全书。现在，我再次建议，是否可以在我们修订“辞海”完毕、摸索到一些经验之后，继续编辑一部五千万字，十卷本的小型百科全书。我们相信在党的领导下，采取群众路线，广泛发动学术界的力量，通盘协作，是可以在比较短的时期内编辑出版这样一部工具书的。这一建议，如被采纳，希望全国学术界给我们大力支持和全力协作。
    在工作中，我们曾走了一些弯路。经过一段时间的实践，才逐步认识到要多快好省地修订“辞海”，必须以毛泽东思想为指导。当我们认识到要坚决贯彻毛泽东思想以后，我们的工作进展就很顺利，全体工作人员心情舒畅，而且信心百倍，都认为我们一定能够完成党所交给我们的这一个光荣任务。这里，想谈一谈我们在工作中的两点体会：
    第一，党的领导和群众运动相结合，是一切工作的根本方法，也是出色地完成一切工作的根本保证。我们从修订“辞海”工作中再一次证明这一个千锤百炼的真理。
    在这一个问题上，我们有经验，也有教训。上面已经提到，我们曾经设想：“百位干部、百万元经费和五年时间”，这就是以“专家路线”为指导思想，关起门来修订“辞海”，是少慢差费的做法。党指出用“三结合”的编辑方法，纠正了我们的想法。起初，在我们提出“开门组稿”，把全部编写任务分配给各高等学校、科学研究机关和少数业务部门以后，编辑干部中比较普遍的想法，是依靠自己加工修改；日常所议论的和计算的，是一天可以审查修改多少条，需要多少时间完成审查修改任务。至于如何提高质量，在一个较长时期内很少考虑。（这里的教训是：认真地抓质量迟了一步，因而使所内干部产生苦闷，使编写单位发生了本来可以避免的重复劳动。）去年8、9月，全所同志学习了八中全会决议之后，意气风发，提出了以定稿向党的四十周年献礼的奋斗目标，各编写单位都积极响应，并组织力量，动手编写。但是，所内干部从来稿中发现有部分稿件质量不高，便产生了一种埋怨、叫苦情绪，部分干部甚至对用群众路线的编写方法抱有怀疑。针对这种情况，结合学习，我们向干部提出，不仅要依靠群众编写，还要发动群众审查。起初，不少干部在思想上有抵触，认为这样做自己就不能掌握命运，质量得不到保证。经过学习，同时又提出要狠抓质量，从来稿中研究质量问题；并开始出版“辞海编辑情况”，介绍经验，讨论质量，才初步有了认识，但由于在实际工作中质量问题并没有很好解决，因而在大量的来稿中，质量还是不高，于是那种怀疑和不信任思想又抬起头来了，有既不信任编写单位、自己又无信心的情绪。我们便提出学习毛主席的“从群众中来，到群众中去”
  “集中起来，坚持下去”的群众路线工作方法，从来稿中研究质量不高的主要原因，并挑选若干代表性词目，用解剖麻雀的方法，从内容上研究质量问题（起先的做法是逐条提意见，又大多属于编写体例和压缩文字方面的），在“辞海编辑情况”上介绍和提出讨论。此外，编辑干部又亲自到编写单位和编写者一起讨论研究；并召开学科编委小组扩大会（吸收主要编写人员参加）进行讨论。经过这些工作，编写单位普遍反映帮助较大，逐渐明确“辞海”所要求的质量标准；而且也改变了编写方法，从少数人埋头写稿到发动师生一起讨论和修改。我们又要求所内干部进一步明确质量标准，去协助编写单位。特别通过这一次编印“‘辞海’试写稿”的工作，全体干部体会很深，认识到必须依靠群众，而且也只有依靠群众，大搞群众运动来修订“辞海”，才能多快好省。这个工作在市委的支持与领导下，发动面很广，工作也比较深入细致。这次试写稿，所有编写单位的党委都十分重视，不少单位的负责同志亲自动员，并作为头等重要的科学研究任务。一般都经过各单位反复讨论、修改，层层审查，最后定稿送我所汇总。经过汇辑，油印出来，经小规模的群众审查，又分头召开学科编委扩大小组会议研究，不少门类是经过逐条讨论的。好几门类几乎每条都提出修改意见，纠正了不少政治性的、科学性的和事实上的错误。而且经过讨论，进一步发现和明确了各门学科中有关质量的若干主要问题。又发还编写单位，经再度修改后才付印。在付印过程中，又再一次将校样分送编写单位校核、修改，如政法编委小组，还经过了一次集体修改。初步看来，问题是体例上还很不一致（这一点，以后是容易解决的），而在释文内容的质量上却有了很大的提高。当然，并不是试写稿的质量已经很高了，只是说，比起前一阶段来质量提高得多了。在事实上，即在校对过程中，就发现问题不少。为着赶上大会，来不及充分修改。好在这是试写稿，今后通过几次审查、修改，质量是可以逐步提高的。我在上面提到：“满城争说编辞海”，就是真实地反映了最近几个月来大搞群众运动修订“辞海”的实际情况。现在所内所外开始形成一种舆论：修订“辞海”必须大搞群众运动。
    第二，提高“辞海”的质量，释文内容更须认真贯彻毛泽东思想。但这不是一件简单的工作，还要经过一个认真的钻研过程和艰巨的思想工作。
    党指示：修订后的“辞海”，是一部以百科知识为主兼顾单字、语词的综合性的辞书。对百科、语词的编写内容必须正确，符合马克思列宁主义的立场观点，并尽量阐明最新的科学成就；解释力求简明易懂，适合中等文化水平的人使用。我们对这个指示，是逐步认识的。在编委会提出要贯彻政治性、科学性、通俗性的原则以后，这在当时似乎是明确了；但工作一深入，接触到实际编写，又觉得不够明确了，如何把这个原则贯彻在编写的内容中呢？究竟怎样才算质量高呢？说来说去只是“三性”，停留在抽象的概念上，觉得缺少办法，接着，领导指示，编写“辞海”必须贯彻毛泽东思想。这样，质量标准才进一步明确了，开始认识到要有高度水平的质量，必须贯彻毛泽东思想。
    贯彻毛泽东思想，是一件严肃的工作，也是一项意义重大的科学研究任务。我们要对很多词目给以完整的、明确的、科学的解释，必须把毛主席的著作和党的方针、政策、指示，进行全面的、认真的钻研、分析和概括工作，不能断章取义。不然的话，就会发生严重的政治性错误。现在看来，在这方面还要经过一个十分艰苦的钻研过程。以“和平改造”这一条为例，草稿（见试写稿）只说明把资本家所有制改变为全民所有制，没有说明把资本家改造成为自食其力的劳动者，这样就把“和平改造”更为重要、更为本质的意义忽视了。这是与毛泽东思想相违背的。
    从实际出发，系统地阐明我国民主革命总路线、过渡时期总路线和社会主义建设总路线，充分反映革命斗争和生产斗争过程中的重大理论，充分反映最新的科学成就，又是贯彻毛泽东思想、保证“辞海”质量的根本问题，这就是高度的政治性，也是高度的科学性。经初步检查，有不少反映当前总路线、大跃进的重要词目，还没有吸收进来；对已经收进的词目的释文内容，也没有充分反映或根本没有反映最新成就，还存在脱离政治、脱离实际的缺点。如写“反围盘”这一条，草稿只说明反围盘的技术内容，并未说明它是工人张明山的发明创造，以及当时促进生产的重大意义，认为它在技术上还有缺点，故避而不谈。写“小高炉”，也只是介绍技术上的问题，并未提出土洋并举对大炼钢铁和大跃进的重大意义。在语词部分，对古汉语进行科学解释，必须正确掌握历史观点，既不能以现代人的思想、语言去代替古汉语原有的意思，又不好用古人的解释去叫现代人理解。应该既要有客观的态度，又要使现代人能正确理解古汉语的本来意思（我们叫“还它本来面目”）。这个问题，现在还有争论。
    总之，我们认识到只有贯彻毛泽东思想，才能使新“辞海”有高度水平的质量。当前，在贯彻中，尽管还存在着困难和问题；但我们坚信，只要认真学习，坚决贯彻，困难是可以克服的，问题是可以逐步解决的。
    现在我们信心百倍地在党的领导下，采用群众路线的编辑方法，以毛泽东思想为指导，加强思想领导，加强多方面的协作，为争取“辞海”的高度水平而奋斗！
