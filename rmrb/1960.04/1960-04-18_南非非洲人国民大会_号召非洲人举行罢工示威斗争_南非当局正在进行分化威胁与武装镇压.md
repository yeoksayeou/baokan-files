Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Johannesburg News: The emergency committee of the South African African National Congress continued to distribute leaflets in many African townships in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and other places on the 16th, calling on Africans to launch a week-long "stay-at-home" strike movement starting from the 18th. At the same time, they demanded that they hold new demonstrations against the "Pass Laws."

The news said that in order to undermine and obstruct the strike struggle brewing among Africans, the South African authorities have been dividing and threatening African workers. A spokesman for the police authorities in Pretoria, the capital of the South African Federation, blatantly said: "If Africans do not comply with the call to stay at home, they will receive maximum protection," and at the same time, "strict measures will be taken against those who threaten those willing to work." Police officers in Port Elizabeth clamored that in order to "prevent riots, force will be used, even force that causes death."

The South African authorities' Department of Bantu Administration and Development also issued a statement on the 16th regarding the African National Congress's distribution of leaflets, intimidating Africans by saying that "a considerable number of workers have been dismissed" in the recent strike movement launched by Africans; the statement also said that unless they find work, they will be sent back to "detention areas" for forced labor.

At the same time, the South African authorities are continuing to carry out armed suppression activities. In the past few days, many more Africans who persisted in resistance have been arrested.

However, the heroic South African people are not intimidated by the authorities' atrocities and threats. According to reports, when the Johannesburg court "tried" a group of Africans who had recently been arrested on the 14th, the Africans shouted the slogan "Freedom" in the colonists' court.

    南非非洲人国民大会
    号召非洲人举行罢工示威斗争
    南非当局正在进行分化威胁与武装镇压
    新华社17日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非非洲人国民大会紧急委员会16日继续在约翰内斯堡、伊丽莎白港等地的许多非洲人市镇散发传单，号召非洲人从18日起展开为期一周的“留在家里”的罢工运动，同时，要求他们举行反对“通行证法”的新的示威。
    消息说，南非当局为了破坏和阻挠正在非洲人中酝酿的这次罢工斗争，对非洲工人进行了分化和威胁。南非联邦首都比勒陀利亚警察当局的发言人公然说：“如果非洲人不遵从要他们留在家里的号召，他们将得到最大限度的保护”，同时“对于威胁愿意上工的人将采取严厉措施”。伊丽莎白港的警官叫嚣说，为了“防止暴乱，将使用武力，甚至包括引起死亡的武力”。
    南非当局的非洲人（班图）行政和开发部16日还就非洲人国民大会散发传单这件事发表声明，向非洲人进行恫吓说，在最近非洲人展开的罢工运动中，“有相当数量的工人被解雇了”；声明还说，除非他们找到工作，不然，他们将被送回“拘留地”去强迫劳动。
    与此同时，南非当局仍在继续进行武装镇压活动。在过去几天中又有许多坚持反抗的非洲人被逮捕。
    但是，英勇的南非人民并不为当局的暴行、恫吓所骇倒。据报道，约翰内斯堡法院在14日“审讯”最近被捕的一批非洲人时，非洲人在殖民者的法庭上高呼“自由”的口号。
